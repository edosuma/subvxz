WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.605
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.670 --> 00:06.810
Vault's something called
an Excelsior 5200.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.182
What's that mean?
That I'm gonna need you

00:08.275 --> 00:10.448
to get me a hell
of a lot more Emulex.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.151
Safe to assume the names
herein are landowners'?

00:13.213 --> 00:15.853
This room ain't bugged.
Won't nobody know we spoke.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.155
These landowners
are in the ledger

00:17.217 --> 00:19.219
'cause Avery Markham
has designs on buying?

00:19.319 --> 00:20.730
Or has already bought.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.357
The negotiation has ended.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.458
I told you,
you can't have my land.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.198
I'm adding hers to the list.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.636
Albert Fekus?

00:27.694 --> 00:30.470
The one who said
you stabbed him.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.069
How fortunate that he came
clean the way he did.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.875
Katherine Hale asked me

00:36.970 --> 00:38.643
about Amen Fekus, the guard!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.378
She's just testing you.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.976
Christ, I have to
get out of here!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.657
The more I think about
it, the better it sounds.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.388
The bluegrass state has some of the
most lonely soil in the union.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.758
Weed used to grow so big here,

00:51.852 --> 00:54.332
old timers called it
"Christmas tree dope."

00:54.388 --> 00:57.232
Hell, before it
all got legalized,

00:57.324 --> 00:59.565
our people were growing hemp
for the whole country.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.503
You remember those stories.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.339
This morning
we were fixin' to leave.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.844
Now you want to be a farmer.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.073
Not a farmer, an entrepreneur.

01:09.169 --> 01:12.343
Cultivating something near and dear
to our hearts <i>as</i> coal once was.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.852
You said Harlan was dying,
that we had no future here.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.286
Well, this new enterprise
might be just what she needs

01:21.381 --> 01:23.418
to make her way off
life support.

01:23.517 --> 01:27.226
And all we got to do is
get ahead of Avery Markham!

01:28.522 --> 01:30.695
Are you sure about this, Boyd?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.600
About staying, I mean?

01:32.693 --> 01:35.196
'Cause it seems to me,
with that kind of cash,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.264
we could be the king and
queen wherever we want.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.241
Oh, baby.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.279
Wasn't more than a few days
ago you had your heart set

01:41.368 --> 01:42.574
on staying in Harlan.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.809
Now you can't wait to leave?

01:46.373 --> 01:48.717
That's before I knew
your intent to poke the bear

01:48.775 --> 01:51.779
and pitch your tent
right outside his den.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.118
Which is why I'm gonna need you

01:53.213 --> 01:54.283
to make up the guest room.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.419
I want one of the boys
to have eyes on you 2417

01:57.484 --> 01:58.986
till this thing plays out.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.622
How lung's that gonna last?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.394
Less than you fear

02:02.456 --> 02:03.491
and more than you hope,
most likely.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.929
What does that mean'?

02:05.993 --> 02:07.973
Hold on a second,
baby. Carl?

02:08.061 --> 02:09.335
Did you get my message?

02:09.429 --> 02:12.672
Listen, listen, you got to
make it clear in every way

02:12.766 --> 02:15.337
they need to hold off
and sell only to me.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.415
All right, h-hold on.
Hold on one second.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.615
Evening, Officer.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.311
Quite a party y'all
are throwing here.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.319
How you doing tonight, ma'am?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.151
I'd be better if I hadn't
been sitting in traffic

02:25.245 --> 02:26.849
last half-hour.
Well, we're trying

02:26.947 --> 02:29.621
to keep people safe and sound
around here, all right?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.788
Imagine my relief.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.092
- Hmm.
- Have you ever been?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.699
Long as you're doing all right,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.232
I believe we can get
you on your way.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.438
I'm fine.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.174
All right. Drive safe.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.680
Well, good luck finding
your guest of honor.

02:52.372 --> 02:55.649
Carl, you still there?
I got you On speakerphone.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.279
Hold on.
Hold on one second.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.163
How'd she seem?

03:08.221 --> 03:10.531
You're asking my opinion,
I'd say she seemed...

03:10.624 --> 03:11.796
...on edge.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.962
All right. Well, you can
wrap it up. Thank you.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.311
What do you think?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.510
I think you better
get your ass to Lexington

03:22.569 --> 03:25.311
and find Albert Fekus before
he blows this whole thing up.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.209
You're not doing it right!

03:27.307 --> 03:28.684
Stop!

03:28.742 --> 03:29.812
Hey.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.524
Any more fighting, and grandma's
gonna lock y'all in the closet.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.194
Play nice.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.694
Hey.
Hey.

03:50.030 --> 03:54.445
There are, uh,
children in your room.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.945
Laurel's nanny had an emergency

03:56.036 --> 03:58.778
with her immigration
papers, so...

03:58.872 --> 04:02.547
Thomas, Fi, meet my friend, Mr.
Duffy.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.022
Hey, guys.
What you doing?

04:11.384 --> 04:12.795
They seem nice.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.465
So...

04:16.523 --> 04:17.593
Where are we?

04:17.690 --> 04:20.262
Um, my guy's at Fekus' house.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.135
If law enforcement shows up
to move or question him,

04:22.229 --> 04:23.606
we have our answer.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.267
And what if no one shows up?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.572
We figure out a way
to question him ourselves.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.146
You know, last time I was
worried about someone

04:30.237 --> 04:32.581
being an informant was
when Grady went away.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.546
It took a while,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.885
but we will soon
settle that as well.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.292
I like Ava.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.153
Be a shame to have to kill her.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.308
Well, ain't this
an unexpected surprise.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.901
I thought after that
continental nonsense

05:00.967 --> 05:04.346
at the hotel, a big home-cooked
breakfast would hit the spot.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.280
Grab them biscuits and gravy.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.686
What you got? Unh-unh!

05:11.144 --> 05:12.589
Ha ha!

05:14.848 --> 05:16.020
Sit.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.153
Ah. Yes, ma'am.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.090
Here you go.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.531
You're in a much better
mood this morning.

05:26.626 --> 05:31.006
You wake up thinkin', "Goddamn, it's
good to be back in Harlan county“?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.972
If you truly believe
we can have the life

05:34.034 --> 05:36.344
we always dreamed of
here in Harlan,

05:36.436 --> 05:37.608
then I am behind you.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.212
That's my girl.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.819
Will you sit down here
and enjoy this

05:43.877 --> 05:45.151
beautiful breakfast with me?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.783
I can't. I said I'd be
in early at the salon.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.055
Well, it's your choice.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.470
But, baby, ain't no reason for
you to be working that hard.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.225
You know I like to keep busy.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.538
Making breakfast has
roused the cooking bug.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.374
Yeah, I was thinking
maybe tonight I'd do

06:07.467 --> 06:09.071
my fried chicken
and sweet potatoes.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.540
Ooh! Better than
the Colonel himself.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.180
Hey.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.084
Where you going?

06:21.248 --> 06:23.728
There's something
I want to give you.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.887
Sit down.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.821
Go on, sit down.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.939
Now...

06:35.061 --> 06:37.837
I think...
Huh.

06:37.998 --> 06:43.539
That this has been sitting
in my pocket long enough.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.583
It's time for it to go
back where it belongs.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.554
It still fits.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.025
Mmm.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.289
Mmm. Mmm.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.798
I will see you tonight.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.375
Yes, you will.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.504
You okay?

07:48.601 --> 07:50.342
<i>No, Raylan,
I'm losing my mind!</i>

07:50.437 --> 07:52.474
Thinking at any moment Boyd's
gonna answer a phone call

07:52.572 --> 07:56.611
from Katherine, turn around,
and put a bullet in my head!

07:56.676 --> 07:58.952
<i>First off,
Boyd is so delusional,</i>

07:59.012 --> 08:01.117
<i>he'll kill three of his own
people before he allows himself</i>

08:01.181 --> 08:02.922
<i>to suspect you of anything.</i>

08:03.083 --> 08:05.085
Secondly, Tim and Rachel
are up in Lexington

08:05.151 --> 08:07.131
dealing with Fekus as we speak.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.189
Jesus Christ,
you're shittin' me!

08:09.289 --> 08:12.429
So he could have talked, and
you all would have no idea.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.837
<i>Let's have this conversation
in person. Where are you now?</i>

08:15.929 --> 08:19.103
What if I said I'm done with this, I'm out?
What happens?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.676
I can meet you at that
junkyard in 20 minutes.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.543
<i>Uh-uh.
I ain't going anywhere.</i>

08:23.636 --> 08:26.446
I ain't doing anything until you
tell me what my options are.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.680
Now I've given you stuff.
I walk, what do I get?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.687
<i>Based on what
you've provided thus far,</i>

08:31.778 --> 08:33.815
I can't even promise
you won't go back to jail.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.986
Bullshit!

08:36.182 --> 08:39.493
<i>I need solid intel
that leads to an indictment,</i>

08:39.552 --> 08:42.624
<i>and then I can work
on> a WitSec proposal.</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:47.035
WitSec? Live some fake
life someplace I hate?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.970
Oh, my god.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.508
What about cash?

08:50.563 --> 08:52.907
You could just let me go,
pay me off.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.009
<i>That is just not an option.</i>

08:55.068 --> 08:56.638
<i>Now we will take care of Fekus.</i>

08:56.703 --> 08:58.307
<i>Boyd still thinks
you're on the level.</i>

08:58.371 --> 09:00.044
We are fine, Ava.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.144
Now, could we please
meet in person?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.388
Thirty minutes, junkyard.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.023
You don't think it's odd?
Of course.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.037
But Fekus stabbed himself
to get Ava put away.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.970
So you'll understand
that the revelation that

09:55.061 --> 09:57.735
he lives with his parents
doesn't exactly blow my mind.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.243
Don't speed up. Don't slow down.
Just drive.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.608
Which one?

10:01.701 --> 10:03.738
This maroon piece
of shit at nine o'clock.

10:03.803 --> 10:04.907
Shit.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.315
Yeah, leaves on his car.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.129
Looks like he's been
parked there for hours.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.817
How much you want to bet
they got someone at the house

10:12.912 --> 10:14.050
just waiting for us?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.424
I'd be willing
to put money on that

10:25.058 --> 10:26.662
"Aplex"?
Yeah.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.636
28 points. Boom!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.942
I'm pretty sure "aplex"
isn't a word, Mikey.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.803
Of course it is.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.006
"I don't like that guy.
He aplexes me."

10:54.087 --> 10:55.088
Yeah?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.155
He's going. You want
me to follow him or not?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.933
<i>Yes, I do.
Call me when he lands.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:03.599
You okay?

11:05.632 --> 11:06.872
You look aplexed.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.791
Hey, it's Givens.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.526
I need a location
on Ava Crowder's phone.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.084
What's that mean, "Just off
the side of the road"?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.799
How long has it been
since it moved?

11:36.629 --> 11:38.973
What's around there?
Anything?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.340
Shit.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.210
No, no, I'm sure it's fine. I'll
take care of it. Thank you.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.010
Goddamn it, Ava.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.015
Goddamn it.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.735
Raylan!

12:09.829 --> 12:11.240
What's going on, amigo?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.091
It's been a while since
you blew up my phone.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.669
Listen, I got a situation
maybe brewing here,

12:15.735 --> 12:16.941
need a hand.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.413
But it requires zipped lips.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.074
Only comes back
to me. Got it?

12:20.340 --> 12:23.344
Hey, hey, my shit
is zipped, all right?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.717
What's the gig?

12:24.777 --> 12:26.222
<i>Ava Crowder's gone missing.</i>

12:26.279 --> 12:28.520
<i>I need you to help me find her.</i>

12:28.581 --> 12:32.358
Ava... Ava Randolph?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.955
From high school?

12:35.054 --> 12:37.398
Yeah, she used to be
Ava Randolph.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.094
Oh. Damn.
Raylan, that...

12:40.193 --> 12:42.366
That girl can make
a dog break its chain.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.266
Yes, she is pretty.
I need you to listen.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.810
Oh...
<i>There's a place</i>

12:46.899 --> 12:48.776
she's gone before when
she needs to disappear.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.405
I want you to go there, watch,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.075
tell me if she shows up.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.783
Truth be told, I'm
here 'cause I need a car.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.452
And what's
the matter with yours?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.457
Nothing in particular,

13:02.548 --> 13:04.619
except today it doesn't
suit my needs.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.664
I look like a used car
salesman to you?

13:07.754 --> 13:10.064
I prefer to keep
the purchase quiet.

13:11.891 --> 13:15.964
You running from Boyd,
the law, or both?

13:16.062 --> 13:17.336
What makes you think that...

13:17.430 --> 13:19.341
Now if'n you running
from Boyd now,

13:19.432 --> 13:20.968
a different car might
get you some distance.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.571
But the law? Don't matter
what you're driving.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.243
Uh-uh. You need
new papers, a new life.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.787
In fact, running is a mistake.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.082
That's how they find you.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.646
And then they'll no doubt

13:32.745 --> 13:34.816
come up here looking for you,

13:34.914 --> 13:36.985
bringing headache and hassle,

13:37.083 --> 13:39.495
wearin' my black ass out.

13:39.585 --> 13:42.498
I promise you this will be
the last time I come up here

13:42.588 --> 13:44.295
and ask you for help.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.764
Well, what you gonna
do for me, Ava?

13:55.368 --> 13:57.314
Please.
That ain't worth the time

13:57.370 --> 13:59.680
I just spent listening
to this bullshit.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.013
Certainly ain't enough to
take on the kind of trouble

14:02.108 --> 14:04.281
helping you's gonna bring.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.117
You got to give me something
gonna get me excited, girl.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.522
And that little ring
certainly ain't gonna do it.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.131
I can get you more money.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.868
How much more?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.508
A lot.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.739
Enough to solve some serious
problems and then some.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.213
That's desperate talk.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.211
You know what Boyd's been up to?

14:35.174 --> 14:38.553
I did hear tell about a certain
downtown bank getting hit.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.056
Couldn't but help think of your man.
That what we talking about?

14:41.147 --> 14:44.594
I can point you to a large
piece of it hidden away.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.660
But you gotta get me a car.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.324
You got access
to that kind of cash,

14:49.389 --> 14:50.663
why come up here?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.564
Truth be told,

14:55.661 --> 14:59.165
I don't want anyone after
me, especially Boyd.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.238
I just want to disappear.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.939
I just want to be left alone.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.228
You remember
Errol, don't you?

15:22.688 --> 15:24.929
Tell him where to get
this money,

15:25.024 --> 15:27.937
and he'll take you
to a friends garage.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.064
I'll point Errol to the money...

15:30.129 --> 15:32.268
After I get the car.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.910
So long as you ain't playin' me.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.884
That wouldn't be wise.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.621
Did you get it done?

15:53.719 --> 15:56.131
Markham and his boys are
throwing a lot of money around.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.463
Not easy convincing
people to turn it away.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.265
Well, I hope you made it
clear no amount of money's

16:00.326 --> 16:02.086
gonna matter if they
ain't alive to spend it.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.406
They got the message.
Should buy us some time,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.465
but we need to get in that
vault sooner than later.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.978
What do you got?

16:09.068 --> 16:11.344
Well,
according to the easily

16:11.437 --> 16:14.145
suggestible clerk
at the Kentucky D.M.S.,

16:14.240 --> 16:18.814
there's an adit that
dead-ends right here.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.983
Well, that's only,
what, 200 yards?

16:22.081 --> 16:23.924
187 yards, to be exact.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.155
You're not thinking about...

16:25.251 --> 16:26.958
Oh, that's exactly
what I'm thinking.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.162
Is that gonna be dangerous?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.759
Exposed chutes, collapses.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.432
Black damp, white damp.
Over 40 years of neglect.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.375
Blanton's one of the most dangerous
there is. We're gonna need help.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.876
Bringing on another guy?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.503
You know what black damp is?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.206
Carbon dioxide, no oxygen.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.107
Well, technically,
it's carbon dioxide

16:47.173 --> 16:48.982
and nitrogen
taking out the oxygen.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.443
How did you know that?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.604
I did a couple summers of room and
pillar mining up near Mt. Sterling.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.820
Well, you're my kind of man.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.525
So it is gonna be dangerous.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.226
Imagine all the air

17:03.322 --> 17:05.962
being sucked out of your lungs.

17:06.157 --> 17:09.469
You're choking,
like you're drowning,

17:09.529 --> 17:12.806
but ain't nary a drop
of water in sight.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.678
This someone we can trust?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.319
Well, I don't know
that trust is an issue.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.883
Last time I saw this man,

17:25.978 --> 17:28.982
he said he was gonna
fill me full of buckshot.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.535
So now none of the
landowners are willing to sell?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.428
That is correct.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.932
Hillbilly shitheads without
two acorns to their name

17:37.023 --> 17:38.900
turning down briefcases of cash.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.561
In what world
does that make sense?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.537
Obviously they're being
coerced by someone...

17:42.662 --> 17:44.699
Is something else
on your mind, Mundo?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.372
Blondie's skimming.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.603
From the register.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.941
Taking money.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.275
All...
All bartenders skim.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.681
The good ones, anyway.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.243
No, man.
I don't accept that.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.385
I'll deal with this shit.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.125
How much, Mundo?
How much is she taking?

18:02.348 --> 18:04.419
It's gotta be like $40 a night.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.859
I saw y'all looking over.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.280
I thought you might
need something.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.029
How about skim milk?

18:11.857 --> 18:13.700
You got any skim milk?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.235
Th... The kitchen
might have some...

18:16.295 --> 18:18.366
He's just kidding.
We're fine, thanks.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.414
You're aware there's
a shortage of arable farmland

18:26.472 --> 18:27.883
here in Harlan, correct?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.049
Mmm, that's the word.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.111
And each property
we fail to acquire

18:32.211 --> 18:34.623
potentially costs this
operation tens of millions

18:34.714 --> 18:36.660
in future earnings, yes?

18:36.749 --> 18:37.750
Affirmative.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.262
Well, perhaps
you could forget about

18:39.318 --> 18:41.628
the 40 goddamn dollars
the bartender's skimming

18:41.721 --> 18:44.258
and focus on the larger problem.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.961
There ain't no problem.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.334
People don't wanna sell,
kill 'em.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.734
That worked once because
those folks had no kin

18:52.798 --> 18:54.358
and their house
went back to the county.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.346
Rest of these landowners
got relatives

18:56.435 --> 18:57.778
ready to inherit
their properties,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.277
which means we're
back at square one.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.450
Stay here. I'll be back.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.078
Hopefully we'll still have jobs.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.591
Hey, maybe the, uh,
bartender is the one

19:10.650 --> 19:13.096
interfering with us
buying those properties.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.656
You think?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.091
No!

19:22.928 --> 19:24.601
And who do we have to blame

19:24.664 --> 19:27.042
for this sudden shift
in our fortune?

19:27.266 --> 19:29.109
We've made enemies aplenty,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.045
but the only two with the sway
to pull off this kind of thing

19:31.137 --> 19:33.617
are the Marshal, Givens,
or the criminal, Crowder.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.849
Two very different animals

19:37.943 --> 19:40.150
who will require
two very different methods

19:40.212 --> 19:41.782
of problem-solving.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.625
I'll find out which is our
primary, target accordingly.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.860
You should bear in mind that “who?" ain't
the only question needs answering here.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.524
Our adversary somehow knows

19:50.623 --> 19:53.331
exactly which properties
we're chasing,

19:54.627 --> 19:57.836
information I had hoped
was not easily acquired.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.800
I know just the man
to see about that.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.902
Then I suggest you go see him.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.505
And shore up any other leaks
your ship may have sprung.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.720
Permission to speak freely, sir?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.716
You about to give me an opinion,

20:16.816 --> 20:19.490
or a warning, or both?

20:20.319 --> 20:22.560
Seems to me I've been
perfectly clear about

20:22.655 --> 20:25.261
what I expect
to transpire down here.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.665
Shouldn't be any more
up for discussion.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.267
Very well, sir.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.281
Put that shit away.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.423
What the hell's wrong with you?

21:02.528 --> 21:03.598
Who is it?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.471
It's Boyd Crowder!

21:14.106 --> 21:15.983
Uh, uh!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

21:16.075 --> 21:17.145
Hold on.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.980
You remember what I told
you last time I seen you?

21:21.313 --> 21:22.587
Well, if you mean
the notion to shoot me

21:22.648 --> 21:24.491
with that shotgun,
I most certainly do.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.399
But... I have a problem
that can only be solved

21:29.455 --> 21:31.901
with your wealth of expertise.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.062
Now...

21:35.795 --> 21:37.274
What say...

21:38.564 --> 21:39.804
We...

21:40.466 --> 21:44.073
We let the past
fade off in the rearview

21:44.136 --> 21:46.173
and start anew?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.467
I... I... I just...

22:13.532 --> 22:16.206
Well, come on, Zachariah,
I just want to talk to you!

22:17.603 --> 22:18.843
Who in the hell was that again?

22:19.705 --> 22:20.979
That's Ava's uncle.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.343
He and the other Randolphs
never did forgive

22:23.442 --> 22:26.150
my deceased brother Bowman
for how he treated Ava.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.626
Doesn't seem like that
bottle's gonna get it done.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.184
No, it does not.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.956
Time to bring in the big guns.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.657
Shakes you up.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.857
You don't have to tell me.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.328
Made me aware of
the wrongs I committed.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.971
Grateful to have a chance
to live and set 'em right.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.401
You're lucky.

22:46.498 --> 22:49.502
Was a time, that shot hadn't
killed you, Limehouse would have.

22:51.637 --> 22:52.980
Which way to the money?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.717
No, we agreed.
I get the car first.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.736
So you get
the car, then you tell me

22:58.744 --> 23:00.314
where the money is
so I head off to some

23:00.379 --> 23:02.154
made-up location
while you drive off?

23:02.548 --> 23:04.550
Shoot, you didn't really think
we'd go for that, did you?

23:04.750 --> 23:05.751
You don't believe me?

23:05.851 --> 23:07.057
Ain't about believing.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.598
It's about making sure
Mr. Limehouse gets his money.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.062
You understand that,
I'm sure, baby girl.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.203
Now which way to the money?

23:31.677 --> 23:32.677
Givens.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.271
<i>I got 'em, Raylan.
I'm all over it.</i>

23:34.380 --> 23:35.859
Is she in Nobles?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.917
No, hey, I followed
them out of Nobles.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.121
I leapfrogged ahead of 'em

23:39.218 --> 23:40.390
so they wouldn't know
I was following them.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.852
Now they're headed
through downtown.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.363
All right. Be careful, Bob.
Don't tip 'em.

23:44.556 --> 23:47.093
Don't worry about me, man.
I was born for this shit.

23:47.192 --> 23:48.193
Yeah, I'm coming to you.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.246
I think you guys got
the wrong room.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.795
Looks like the right one to me.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.497
You guys with Cindy?

24:18.991 --> 24:20.129
Cindy?

24:20.326 --> 24:21.327
Yeah.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.398
Is that why you left
mom and dad's,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.306
sexed up this shitty
little motel room?

24:26.398 --> 24:28.742
You gonna have yourself the
girlfriend experience, Albert?

24:29.134 --> 24:30.306
Who are you guys?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.409
Just need to talk
to you, Albert.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.753
Talk about what?

24:38.577 --> 24:39.920
Ava Crowder.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.160
Uh, Zachariah?

24:50.322 --> 24:51.824
Keep your hands
where he can see 'em!

24:55.861 --> 24:59.206
Ahh! Now, before
you raise that shotgun,

24:59.298 --> 25:01.778
I want to show you
something on my phone.

25:02.201 --> 25:06.308
Now, this here
is a wire transfer

25:06.372 --> 25:08.511
for $10,000

25:08.607 --> 25:10.047
from my associate's
account to yours.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.909
Only thing I need is
your banking information.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.652
Uh, uh, now I-l know

25:14.713 --> 25:17.319
that the Crowders and Randolphs
have had some bad blood.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.056
Although Ava taking
Bowman's life

25:19.151 --> 25:20.892
should have ameliorated
the situation.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.699
I see you brought
some reinforcements

25:24.790 --> 25:25.791
to our little party.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.800
I ain't got a lot
of time, Zachariah.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.032
Now, you see that?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.134
Now you say the word,
I hit this button,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
thirty seconds later,
that money's in your account.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.341
We sit down, have us
a drink from that bottle,

25:39.405 --> 25:41.976
and you just hear me out.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.221
Uh...

25:45.310 --> 25:46.812
What manner of work?

25:46.912 --> 25:48.823
Well, Zachariah,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.758
the only manner you live for.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.523
Mmm.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.996
All I did was tell the truth.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.204
Why the sudden change of heart?

26:01.927 --> 26:03.565
Because I couldn't take the idea

26:03.662 --> 26:06.609
of Ava being gone forever
because of what I did.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.605
So you had what one might
call a crisis of conscience.

26:12.838 --> 26:13.908
What?

26:14.006 --> 26:16.714
A crisis of conscience.

26:16.775 --> 26:19.346
Yeah. Yeah, right.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.881
What do you think
of that, Mikey?

26:22.948 --> 26:25.019
I think it's some
soft-ass nonsense.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.563
If what you claim is true,

26:29.621 --> 26:32.625
shouldn't you be getting ass-raped
in the shower right about now?

26:32.724 --> 26:34.362
No, Ava decided
not to press charges.

26:35.727 --> 26:38.469
Wow. That was nice of her.

26:38.564 --> 26:42.273
Why do you think she decided to do that?

26:42.367 --> 26:44.779
Look, I don't know, man.
Why don't you ask her, huh?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.214
I mean, I lost my job,
my pension.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.149
This whole thing laid me
real low, all right?

26:50.242 --> 26:51.949
Maybe she didn't want
to lay me any lower.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.491
So you sent her to hell,
and she decided to

26:55.581 --> 26:56.992
let you off the hook?

26:57.082 --> 26:58.925
Or maybe she was so relieved
I did the right thing,

26:58.984 --> 27:00.292
she forgave me.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.296
Did you ever think
of that, smart guy?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.562
Yeah.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.299
But that's just not
gonna work for us.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.603
What do you guys
want me to say, huh?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.009
I mean, I'll...
I'll just say

27:16.101 --> 27:17.621
whatever you want me
to say, all right?

27:22.474 --> 27:23.578
What is that?

27:23.742 --> 27:25.585
That is a good
old-fashioned cattle prod.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.320
I used to use, uh, tasers,

27:30.415 --> 27:32.258
but then they started
equipping the cartridges

27:32.317 --> 27:34.957
with these I.D. tags,
made 'em easily trackable.

27:35.020 --> 27:39.435
But this little baby right
here delivers 2 million volts

27:39.491 --> 27:41.368
with no record it ever happened.

27:44.830 --> 27:45.934
Last chance, Al.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.602
I don't want to be here anymore.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.215
Please. Don't...
Don't do that.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.012
How did Ava
get out of prison?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.848
I told you. Okay?

27:56.942 --> 27:58.353
That's what happened.
No, no...

28:02.848 --> 28:04.350
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

28:04.449 --> 28:05.889
<i>Tell the truth,
all this stops.</i>

28:05.951 --> 28:07.862
God!

28:10.189 --> 28:12.294
Mikey's gonna keep
going till you come clean.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.337
I told you everything I know!

28:16.795 --> 28:17.967
Damn it!

28:18.363 --> 28:19.899
Tell the truth,
this stops now.

28:19.998 --> 28:20.999
Please.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.471
Aah!

28:23.535 --> 28:25.139
Please!

28:26.371 --> 28:28.851
Please make it stop!
Just make...

28:28.907 --> 28:31.046
Aah! Goddamn it!

28:31.143 --> 28:32.986
Don't be a hero, Al!

28:33.045 --> 28:36.185
I swear to God,
I loved her, all right?

28:36.248 --> 28:38.319
And I wanted to stop
her suffering, I swe...

28:38.383 --> 28:41.057
Mikey! All right.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.598
You believe him?

28:42.688 --> 28:45.726
<i>I think if the sorry
little shit knew anything,</i>

28:45.824 --> 28:47.064
<i>he would have spilled by now.</i>

28:47.159 --> 28:48.866
<i>Do we need to kill him?</i>

28:50.562 --> 28:53.543
<i>I don't think he's gonna
say anything. Are you, Albert?</i>

28:53.599 --> 28:56.773
<i>You promise you're not gonna say
anything about this incident?</i>

28:56.868 --> 28:58.745
Yeah, I promise.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.214
All right.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.377
Well, then we're
gonna let you be.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.749
And maybe...

29:05.844 --> 29:08.848
Maybe you can still
get it up for Cindy.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.466
Albert, you all right?

29:22.561 --> 29:24.097
No, I'm not all right.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.574
You told me you would stop them
if they started hurting me!

29:26.632 --> 29:28.192
Well, we thought
you could tough it out.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.706
Goddamn cattle prod!
Gosh, that hurt!

29:31.770 --> 29:33.215
Maybe you should have
thought about that

29:33.272 --> 29:35.047
before you stabbed yourself
and blamed it on Ava.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.745
But they didn't
kill you, Albert.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.321
And guess what. You're
completely free now.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.949
No more hiding, no more
government supervision.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.755
You've redeemed yourself.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.295
Yeah.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.797
Now do you want us
to take you to a hospital,

29:48.887 --> 29:50.161
or are you okay?

29:50.489 --> 29:51.991
I'm okay.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.228
Good.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.559
Let's roll.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.903
Bump it.
Took that shit like a man.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.509
Uncle Sam thanks you
for your cooperation.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.746
What you gonna do
once you get your car?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.910
None of your business.
Pull up over there.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.148
What the hell for?

30:11.243 --> 30:14.315
We're gonna need a shovel.
The cash is buried.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.323
Didn't occur to you to
mention that up at Nobles?

30:17.416 --> 30:18.827
We got plenty
of shovels up there.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.954
You changed the deal.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.531
I didn't think
I'd have to do it myself.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.993
You wanna dig
with your hands, fine,

30:27.092 --> 30:28.298
but I sure the hell ain't.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.375
I'll just be a minute.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.813
Good, that means
it shouldn't take long.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.111
I'm-a join you.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.362
Hi, Mike. Can you show
Errol where the shovels are?

31:03.462 --> 31:05.874
Hey, hey. Where do you
think you're off to?

31:05.964 --> 31:07.375
I need to use the washroom.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.345
We'll get to that after
we get to what we came for.

31:29.588 --> 31:30.658
They inside?

31:30.922 --> 31:33.061
As of a minute ago.

31:33.158 --> 31:36.196
Figured we'd take 'em down
once they come out.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.070
Yeah, uh...

31:38.163 --> 31:39.665
You're not gonna say anything?

31:40.365 --> 31:41.571
About what?

31:42.167 --> 31:45.273
About my car.
I upped my ride game, man.

31:45.370 --> 31:46.576
It's great.
Yeah,

31:46.671 --> 31:48.378
I had to pawn a bunch of stuff.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.580
Mint in-the-package Star
Wars figures, my AK-47...

31:51.676 --> 31:53.952
Listen, Bob,
I need you to go inside.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.423
Yeah, I know. That's why you called me.
Let's do this.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.426
No, no, I can't do it with you.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.860
You're on your own here.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.625
Errol can't know
I was ever here.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.559
Why not?

32:03.622 --> 32:06.603
I'm gonna tell you this,
Bob, 'cause I trust you.

32:06.691 --> 32:08.364
Ava is my CI.

32:08.693 --> 32:12.971
Now if I can't get her calmed down,
home without anybody knowing,

32:13.064 --> 32:14.737
not only is that woman
in danger,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.871
but this whole case falls apart.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.111
What do you
want me to do?

32:19.204 --> 32:21.650
I want you to go in.
Take him out.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.380
Taken.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.449
Take him out out?

32:25.544 --> 32:28.787
Outside. I want you
to take him outside

32:28.880 --> 32:30.450
so I can go around
through the backdoor,

32:30.982 --> 32:32.086
get Ava.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.325
Okay. Well,
Raylan, um...

32:35.420 --> 32:38.128
Errol's a big guy. What
if he don't listen to me?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.794
Well, you got a badge and a
set of balls, don't you?

32:40.892 --> 32:42.769
There you go. Use those.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.638
Hell, yeah, I got a badge.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.405
And I got balls
like Death Stars.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.469
Let's do this.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.474
You want me to pee in your car?

32:55.574 --> 32:56.848
After we get that cash,

32:56.942 --> 32:58.649
I'll be able to get me
another one.

33:04.850 --> 33:07.990
Hey. Let me
grab that for you.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.463
Thank you, Errol.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.159
Yeah, don't mention it.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.281
Sir, uh, sir, is that your...

33:34.346 --> 33:35.723
Is that your car outside?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.020
Yeah. Why?

33:37.115 --> 33:38.560
May I ask your name, sir?

33:39.284 --> 33:40.786
You can ask, sure.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.024
Sir, my name is
Constable Bob Sweeney,

33:44.122 --> 33:45.465
and I'm asking you your name.

33:48.226 --> 33:49.466
Errol Butler.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.799
Errol Butler. Let men.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.004
Yep, that's what I thought

33:54.065 --> 33:56.306
We got a outstanding warrant
here for your arrest.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.178
No, man.
You got the wrong guy.

33:59.237 --> 34:00.409
Well, I'm sure if you
just step outside with me,

34:00.505 --> 34:01.711
we'll clear this right up.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.606
I ain't stepping anywhere
except inside my car

34:03.642 --> 34:05.747
with my friend,
and we going on our way.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.315
All right, sir, we can
do this the hard way,

34:08.380 --> 34:09.654
or we can do it the easy way.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.060
Oh, yeah?
What's the hard way?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.230
What, you gonna shoot a man

34:13.251 --> 34:14.851
'cause he's standing
in a hardware store?

34:14.985 --> 34:17.023
Negatory. I'm gonna
call for backup,

34:17.088 --> 34:18.897
and you're gonna go to jail,
and then we're gonna continue

34:18.989 --> 34:21.197
this conversation
with you behind bars.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.101
I don't give
a good goddamn if you call

34:23.194 --> 34:25.333
the National Guard, I ain't
going nowhere with you.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.933
In fact, let me see what it
is you actually got on me.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.443
No. Listen... Come
on, let me see it.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.672
No, no, back... Get back.
Let me see this bullshit.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.873
Sir, I have a Taser!

34:31.937 --> 34:32.938
Let me see this bullshit.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.039
Please step back.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.243
I ain't
taking no step back.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.751
Come on, let me see this,
since you're so... Oh!

34:36.841 --> 34:38.081
Ohh!

34:38.176 --> 34:39.348
Bob, that's enough.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.219
When he wakes up, apologize.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.556
Say that it was
a big misunderstanding,

34:45.617 --> 34:47.358
explain to him
how sorry you are,

34:47.418 --> 34:49.399
and escort him to his car.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.525
You, I can't wait to hear what's
gonna come out of your mouth.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.907
Knowing you Crowders,

34:59.965 --> 35:01.967
I...don't wanna be
doing anything

35:02.067 --> 35:03.808
that's gonna land me in prison.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.576
Just your advice,
expertise,

35:06.638 --> 35:10.950
perhaps a little lending hand's
all we need from you, Zachariah,

35:11.042 --> 35:12.953
which is why I appreciate
you telling me

35:13.044 --> 35:14.751
they filled in that
main portal back there.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.453
Yeah, collapsed
some 40 years back.

35:17.549 --> 35:21.463
We were so damn hungry
for that... coal seam,

35:21.553 --> 35:23.430
we didn't think the
abandoned Blanton Bridge

35:23.488 --> 35:28.164
would weaken the tunnels,
but... we was wrong.

35:30.395 --> 35:34.468
ZACHARIAH; Whew! Yeah-These
old steep-pitch mines...

35:34.566 --> 35:37.308
They always needed
proximity vents.

35:37.402 --> 35:41.407
We used old Rosendale
cement. Comes cheap.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.184
Similar type used in the base

35:43.274 --> 35:44.981
of the Statue of Liberty,
mind you.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.157
Well, if you ain't the man,

35:48.246 --> 35:50.317
that means you the man
sitting beside the man,

35:50.415 --> 35:53.521
which means
get your ass to work.

35:56.454 --> 35:57.626
So that's it, huh?

35:57.689 --> 35:59.498
You ain't gonna say
nothin' else?

35:59.591 --> 36:01.195
I just
told you three times

36:01.292 --> 36:02.828
everywhere I went,
who I talked to.

36:02.927 --> 36:03.997
What else you want?

36:04.095 --> 36:07.008
I wanna know what was going
through your goddamn brain.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.509
I wanna know what you were
thinking this morning

36:08.600 --> 36:09.772
when you took off.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.677
I don't know. I wasn't.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.477
Did you even plan?

36:13.538 --> 36:16.519
Where were you gonna stay
tonight and the night after?

36:16.608 --> 36:19.214
You got cash? How much?
Where'd you get it?

36:19.377 --> 36:21.550
You know it's gotta be
cash and only cash, right?

36:21.713 --> 36:23.659
And what about an I.D.?
You got a new I.D.?

36:23.715 --> 36:25.717
Hmm? That's the only way
to get off the grid.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.057
No, I don't.
I didn't think.

36:27.152 --> 36:31.191
I didn't plan. I just ran.
Goddamn it, Raylan!

36:31.289 --> 36:33.291
You oughta be thanking me.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.496
I'm the only reason what you did

36:35.560 --> 36:37.233
isn't ending with you
back in prison,

36:37.328 --> 36:39.035
courtesy of the
US Marshal Service,

36:39.130 --> 36:41.235
or dead by Boyd's hand

36:41.332 --> 36:42.709
or one of them
other knuckleheads,

36:42.801 --> 36:44.337
and that is the only two ways

36:44.402 --> 36:46.348
this little stunt of yours
could have ended.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.814
Can I have my phone
back, please?

36:49.174 --> 36:50.482
Your phone?

36:51.843 --> 36:54.187
Did you even hear
a goddamn word I just said?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.151
Yes.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.050
I'm trying to keep you alive,

36:58.149 --> 37:00.949
and you're running around, trying to
burn the both of us and this case.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.556
Are you done, or would you
like to yell at me some more?

37:03.655 --> 37:06.431
Or can I go back home
and cook the dinner

37:06.524 --> 37:09.994
I promised Boyd so I don't have
any more explaining to do?

37:10.361 --> 37:13.001
Honestly, I'd kinda like
lo yell at you some more.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.879
Slower, for shit's sake!

37:21.172 --> 37:22.242
Goddamn!

37:22.574 --> 37:24.247
That ain't some
old piece of wetwood

37:24.342 --> 37:25.753
you're cutting through there.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.688
Them sparks got
the fire-damp hoo-doos.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.557
Decomp causes methane.
It's highly combustible.

37:31.616 --> 37:33.118
Combustible? That all
you learned from me?

37:33.218 --> 37:36.062
Methane is lighter than air.
It's always rising up,

37:36.121 --> 37:37.623
just yearnin' for
a place to escape,

37:37.722 --> 37:40.202
and that gon' be right where
them damn sparks are flyin'.

37:40.925 --> 37:41.926
Go on!

37:49.033 --> 37:51.138
Goddamn, boy! Ain't
you retain nothin'?

37:51.236 --> 37:52.806
You really love this
shit, don't you?

37:52.904 --> 37:53.939
Yeah!

37:54.572 --> 37:56.882
Like a monk misses
his monastery!

38:01.412 --> 38:02.891
Get the hell off of there!

38:10.388 --> 38:12.459
Jesus Christ!

38:18.830 --> 38:20.070
Aah!

38:20.498 --> 38:21.568
Whoo!

38:22.934 --> 38:24.641
Come here, boy!

38:26.905 --> 38:28.350
You all right?

38:28.439 --> 38:30.248
Damn.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.419
You all right?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.788
I...I can't hear shit.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.123
Now you think these virgins
gonna make it through?

38:38.183 --> 38:39.992
'Cause I'm thinkin' not.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.157
You gon' be all right!

38:46.424 --> 38:47.767
Damn it, boy.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.501
Goddamn.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.257
We're gonna have to let
this vent for a few hours.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.943
Now after that '90 collapse
over in Joseph's Valley,

38:58.002 --> 38:59.845
didn't I hear you swear up and
down on your mama's grave

38:59.938 --> 39:02.043
that you'd never go in
without a good sounding?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.111
I did, indeed.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.780
Yeah, well, I'm gonna enjoy
seeing you go in the deep.

39:08.213 --> 39:11.285
All those traps and chutes
breaking through

39:11.349 --> 39:13.989
and all those rotting
supports busting up.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.998
Oh, it's gon' be
somethin' to see.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.027
Now are you sure

39:23.127 --> 39:24.663
you don't wanna check us
into a motel?

39:24.729 --> 39:26.689
We could watch the TV
like we did the other night.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.011
Yeah, well, mighty nice
of you to offer, hon,

39:29.067 --> 39:31.172
but I still got some paperwork.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.303
Mmm.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.210
And...

39:35.306 --> 39:36.876
There's a little extra.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.976
Mmm.

39:48.686 --> 39:49.824
Pretty girl.

39:50.588 --> 39:51.760
Friend of yours?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.063
She could be your friend, too.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.030
If you want her number,
just ask.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.733
Yeah, no, not tonight.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.676
Well, didn't know
you were coming by,

40:02.734 --> 40:04.941
but now that you're here,
What would you I...

40:05.036 --> 40:06.071
Shh.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.384
Sit.

40:13.444 --> 40:14.582
Please?

40:21.286 --> 40:23.232
Mundo, I was just thinking about

40:23.288 --> 40:25.734
that little S.E.R.E
exercise in Guantanamo.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.962
You remember that?

40:27.058 --> 40:28.401
Yup.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.632
You know what that is?
S.E.R.E?

40:33.898 --> 40:36.310
Survival, evasion,
resistance, and escape.

40:36.401 --> 40:37.573
That's right.

40:37.702 --> 40:41.115
Basically, the role
of interrogation and torture

40:41.205 --> 40:43.913
in acquiring information...
Useful stuff.

40:45.043 --> 40:48.490
By the end of our training,
we got pretty damn good at it.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.655
Nod your head
if you understand me.

40:54.218 --> 40:56.095
Nod your head
if you understand me.

40:58.556 --> 41:00.092
There you go.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.295
Oh. I remember...

41:02.393 --> 41:05.272
This one instance an Afghan,

41:05.330 --> 41:07.435
a brother of a Taliban leader,

41:07.498 --> 41:09.478
who just wouldn't talk.

41:09.567 --> 41:12.980
I mean, this...
This guy had conviction.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.314
You ever heard
of a peroneal strike?

41:16.407 --> 41:18.614
Hitting the peroneal nerve

41:18.676 --> 41:21.316
over and over, day after day,
hour after hour?

41:22.447 --> 41:25.826
This young fella held
out for over a week.

41:25.917 --> 41:30.093
Ouch. But...
He finally talked.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.365
All that unnecessary pain.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.593
Could have been over
before it started.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.941
The doctor that treated him said it
looked like he was hit by a bus.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.035
Well, I don't
understand what this...

41:43.134 --> 41:44.875
No, no, shh, shh.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.689
See, you're the only
other person

41:53.778 --> 41:55.519
who knew which
properties we wanted.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.627
And now... it's out there.

42:04.789 --> 42:06.860
Who's doing it
and how do they know?

42:10.495 --> 42:11.895
Who's doing it
and how do they know?

42:11.896 --> 42:13.466
Who and how, Calhoun?

42:16.801 --> 42:18.803
I honestly don't know.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.317
How about a starter tap?

42:35.920 --> 42:38.992
What the hell, man?
Is he alive?

42:45.329 --> 42:46.501
Mmm-mmm.

42:48.499 --> 42:51.241
I said a starter tap.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.914
You want him slapped like
a little girl, you do it.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.616
All right? You ask me,
he gets Amtrak-ed.

43:03.614 --> 43:05.594
You happy? I'm home, safe.
You can go now.

43:05.683 --> 43:06.684
No.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.424
Not till I know
you ain't gonna wake up

43:08.519 --> 43:09.862
tomorrow mornin' and run again.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.262
I ain't gonna wake up tomorrow
mornin' and run again.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.468
Ava, this ain't gonna
work if there's no trust.

43:17.562 --> 43:20.941
Oh. So now we're gonna have
a trustful relationship.

43:21.032 --> 43:22.067
You want me to believe

43:22.133 --> 43:23.441
that you're gonna
keep me out of danger

43:23.534 --> 43:25.878
when here you are, putting
me right back in it.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.941
The truth is, this is the
safest place you could be,

43:29.040 --> 43:30.644
right here, next to Boyd.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.220
Anywhere else,
you're in trouble.

43:32.577 --> 43:35.285
The truth is, is that you
don't give a shit about me.

43:35.379 --> 43:36.983
You just care
that I don't jeopardize

43:37.081 --> 43:39.425
your precious case against Boyd.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.291
There are plenty of people

43:41.385 --> 43:43.922
to make sure Boyd pays for
the suffering he has caused.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.325
Then why are you here?

43:48.226 --> 43:49.398
What's in it for you?

43:49.560 --> 43:51.631
Finishing the job,

43:51.729 --> 43:53.766
what you and me
started together,

43:53.898 --> 43:57.573
and that is how we're gonna finish it...
Together.

43:58.603 --> 43:59.638
Then what?

43:59.804 --> 44:01.078
It's up to you.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.251
What do you want?

44:06.911 --> 44:08.015
I want cash.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.485
A hundred grand.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.819
That's a bit much.
Aim for 50.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.861
And I want out of the country.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.491
No WitSec deal.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.150
I'll pick the place.
You make it happen.

44:21.192 --> 44:23.536
I can promise you that
I will find you a place

44:23.628 --> 44:24.834
where you are safe...

44:26.631 --> 44:29.111
You can be happy,

44:29.167 --> 44:31.477
and where you can start over.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.848
Now, isn't that what you want?

44:40.278 --> 44:41.689
There's gotta be a place in hell

44:41.779 --> 44:43.986
for a man that breaks
a promise to a woman.

44:45.449 --> 44:46.951
I ain't worried.

44:50.288 --> 44:51.892
You gonna take care of me?

44:52.557 --> 44:55.970
Like you did when you came
to my door after Bowman?

44:56.994 --> 44:58.371
The answer to my prayers?

45:10.808 --> 45:12.048
It's Boyd.

45:16.647 --> 45:18.524
He should be back soon.

45:18.583 --> 45:19.755
You should go.

45:20.751 --> 45:24.062
If you don't mind, I was just
thinking I'd stick around for a bit.
