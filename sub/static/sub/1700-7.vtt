00:02.043 --> 00:06.130
Everybody. Shh. Uh, Central Perk
is proud to present...

00:06.589 --> 00:10.300
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.846
Thanks.

00:14.431 --> 00:17.891
Hi. Um, I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

00:18.143 --> 00:21.729
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.689
Okay, here we go.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.362
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.995
What...?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.544
Oh, great. This is just...

01:42.143 --> 01:43.936
This is so cool, you guys.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.230
The entire city's blacked out.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.982
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens...

01:49.192 --> 01:51.110
...and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.278
- Wow.
- You guys, this is big.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.823
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.825
Who will I meet in a blackout?

01:59.327 --> 02:02.704
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.998
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.126
Can I borrow the phone?

02:07.377 --> 02:10.628
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.381
What's my number?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.009
I never call me.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.304
Oh, my God. It's her.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.473
It's that Victoria Secret model.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.058
Something Goodacre.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.643
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.312
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.439
Oh, my God.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.527
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.739
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?

02:38.199 --> 02:41.910
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.874
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.042
Jill says vestibule...

02:49.294 --> 02:51.503
...I'm going with vestibule.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.463
I'm fine.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.674
No, I'm not alone.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.718
I don't know. Some guy.

02:57.969 --> 03:02.181
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.100
Hey, Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.103
Yes, he was some guy.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.031
Hey, everyone.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.290
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

03:32.545 --> 03:37.007
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have...

03:37.258 --> 03:38.467
...so happy Hanukkah.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.847
Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.976
Ooh.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.478
Oh!

03:50.813 --> 03:53.232
Ooh. That had to hurt.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.653
All right, all right.
It's been 14 and a half minutes...

03:57.904 --> 04:00.697
...and you still haven't said
one word. Oh, God.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.701
Do something.
Just make contact. Smile.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.831
There you go.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.796
You're definitely scaring her.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.589
Uh, would you like to call somebody?

04:19.175 --> 04:22.636
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.726
Yeah, thanks.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.147
Hello?

04:34.315 --> 04:36.316
- It's me.
- It's Chandler.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.609
Are you okay?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.319
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.490
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...

04:44.701 --> 04:47.786
...with Jill Goodacre.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.496
What?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.623
I'm stuck...

04:52.333 --> 04:55.043
...in an ATM vestibule...

04:55.253 --> 04:57.462
...with Jill Goodacre.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.632
I have no idea what you said.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.759
Put Joey on the phone.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.014
What's up, man?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.557
I'm stuck...

05:09.225 --> 05:11.893
...in an ATM vestibule...

05:12.478 --> 05:15.188
...with Jill Goodacre.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.524
Oh, my God.

05:17.775 --> 05:21.069
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.239
Chandler, listen.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.038
Yeah, like that thought
never entered my mind.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.001
Come on, somebody.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.544
I'll go. I'll go.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.965
Okay, um, senior year of college,
on a pool table.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.675
- Ooh.
- Pool table?

05:43.926 --> 05:45.635
That's my sister.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.640
Okay, okay.
My weirdest place would have to be...

05:50.892 --> 05:55.437
...the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.565
Oh, my God. What were you
doing in a library?

06:00.693 --> 06:04.613
- Pheebs, what about you?
- Oh, um, Milwaukee.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.744
Uh, Ross?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.832
Disneyland, 1989.
"It's a small world after all."

06:18.211 --> 06:19.294
No way.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.879
The, uh, ride broke down...

06:21.089 --> 06:25.217
...so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

06:26.677 --> 06:31.098
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.433
Ooh. Rachel?

06:33.643 --> 06:34.851
I already went.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.978
- You did not go.
- Yes, I did.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.772
Tell us. Come on.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.819
All right, uh, the weirdest place
would have to be...

06:46.322 --> 06:48.198
...the foot of the bed.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.494
- Step back.
- We have a winner.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.921
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

07:03.172 --> 07:07.259
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.807
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.604
Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature-golf course.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.022
- Come on.
- No.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.608
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.653
And you didn't marry him because?

07:28.531 --> 07:32.117
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

07:32.368 --> 07:34.786
...never having that kind of?

07:35.037 --> 07:36.621
- Probably.
- Really?

07:36.873 --> 07:40.167
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.877
- Yeah, right.
- It is.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.838
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

07:45.089 --> 07:49.885
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and, uh...

07:50.094 --> 07:52.095
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.646
For all those people who miss out
on that, uh, passion thing...

08:01.898 --> 08:03.482
...there's other good stuff.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.359
Okay.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.820
But, um, I don't think that'll be you.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.072
- You don't?
- Mm-mm.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.283
See, I see, uh...

08:13.451 --> 08:15.702
...big passion in your future.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.496
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.039
- You do?
- I do.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.208
Ross, you're so great.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.634
Ah.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.554
It's never gonna happen.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.522
- What?
- You and Rachel.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.949
Why not?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.495
Because you waited too long
to make your move...

08:58.704 --> 09:01.665
...and now you're in the "Friend Zone."

09:02.917 --> 09:04.751
No, no, no.
I'm not in the Zone.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.045
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.466
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.552
I'm laying the groundwork.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.346
Every day I get
a little bit closer to, uh...

09:16.597 --> 09:17.722
Priesthood.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.353
Ross, I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.816
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.526
I will, I will.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.112
I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.074
What?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.952
- What, now?
- Yeah.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.038
What's messing you up?
The wine?

09:42.290 --> 09:45.041
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?

09:45.251 --> 09:48.795
You gotta go up to her and say,
"Look, Rachel, I think..."

09:49.046 --> 09:50.171
- Shh!
- Shh!

09:50.840 --> 09:52.674
- What are we shushing?
- We're shushing...

09:53.259 --> 09:56.386
...because we're trying to
hear something.

09:56.637 --> 10:00.056
- What?
- Uh, don't you hear that?

10:02.810 --> 10:04.436
Ah.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.730
- See?
- Huh.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.195
- Would you like some gum?
- Oh. Is it sugarless?

10:15.906 --> 10:18.867
- Uh, sorry, it's not.
- Then, no, thanks.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.620
What the hell was that?

10:22.997 --> 10:27.000
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

10:27.251 --> 10:31.338
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.885
New York City has no power

10:37.136 --> 10:40.722
And the milk is getting sour

10:40.973 --> 10:44.309
But to me it is not scary

10:44.560 --> 10:48.647
'Cause I stay away from dairy

10:50.524 --> 10:53.234
La-la
La-la-la-la-la

10:57.907 --> 10:59.282
- Here goes.
- You'll do it?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.950
- I'll do it.
- Want help?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.453
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.038
Ross, Ross.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.123
Good luck, man.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.292
Thanks.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.255
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.178
- Where you going?
- Outside.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.388
You can't go out there.

11:22.056 --> 11:25.266
- Why not?
- Because of, uh, the reason.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.353
And that would be?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.855
I, uh... I can't tell you.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.190
What's going on?

11:33.150 --> 11:37.946
Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.032
- About what?
- He's planning your birthday party.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.577
Oh, my God. I love him.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.287
You better act surprised.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.832
- About what?
- My surprise party.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.086
- What surprise party?
- Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.213
Well, he didn't tell me.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.758
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.303
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.223
- You are not. We tell you stuff.
- Uh-huh.

12:05.391 --> 12:10.019
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.815
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.525
What?

12:16.068 --> 12:18.820
Oh. Looks like I was second to last.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.244
It's so nice.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.709
Hey, I have a question.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.921
Uh, actually, it's not
so much a question...

12:37.173 --> 12:39.799
...it's more of a general wondering...

12:40.801 --> 12:42.093
...ment.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.721
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.890
Here goes.

12:48.893 --> 12:53.354
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

12:53.731 --> 12:56.191
- Oh.
- Yes, that's right.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.735
Look at that little kitty.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.028
What?

13:02.364 --> 13:06.951
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation

13:07.203 --> 13:12.332
And the only explanation I can find

13:12.833 --> 13:17.712
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around

13:19.507 --> 13:22.342
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.386
Ow. Ow.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.972
Sorry, that was wax.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.269
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.855
Why not put "poor little Tootie"
in the hall?

13:37.024 --> 13:39.776
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.027
Yeah?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.783
You know, on second thought,
gum would be perfection.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.869
Gum would be perfection?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.248
Gum would be perfection.

13:53.457 --> 13:57.043
Could've said, "Gum would be nice."
"I'll have a stick." But, no.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.505
For me, gum is perfection.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.467
I loathe myself.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.222
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.099
Oh.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.773
Hi. We just found this cat...

14:19.024 --> 14:20.525
...and we're looking for the owner.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.152
Um, yeah, it's, uh... It's mine.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.156
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

14:27.408 --> 14:29.158
Yeah. It's my cat. Give me my cat.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.828
Wait a minute. What's his name?

14:32.246 --> 14:33.872
Um, Bob... Buttons.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.791
- Bob Buttons?
- Uh-huh.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.877
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.670
Oh!

14:40.838 --> 14:43.506
You are a very bad man.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.634
You owe me a cat.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.891
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.934
Here, kitty, kitty.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.896
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty, kitty?

14:59.148 --> 15:02.942
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

15:06.989 --> 15:08.031
Hi.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.035
Wow.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.081
Come on, lucky sixes.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.752
Everybody, this is Paolo.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.338
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.424
- This is Monica...
- Hi.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.843
- ...and Joey...
- Hi.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.555
- ...and Ross.
- Hi.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.064
Ha, ha. He doesn't speak much English.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.192
Monopoly.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.445
Look at that.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.781
So, uh...

15:50.658 --> 15:52.158
Where did, uh, Paolo come from?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.702
Italy, I think. Heh.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.873
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

16:00.209 --> 16:04.337
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

16:06.173 --> 16:09.425
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

16:12.179 --> 16:16.307
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.977
Oh, I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.563
Ah. Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.943
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.946
Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.786
You betcha.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.584
All right. Okay. What next?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.753
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.924
It's got a, uh, boyish charm.
It's impish.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.551
Here we go.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.689
Nice going, imp.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.942
Okay. It's okay. All I need to do is...

17:08.152 --> 17:12.613
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.077
Good save.
We're back on track and I'm...

17:18.704 --> 17:21.455
...chewing someone else's gum.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.333
This is not my gum.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.419
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.297
And now you're choking.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.341
Are you all right?

17:34.595 --> 17:36.387
Oh, my God.
You're choking.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.852
Better?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.312
Yes.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.397
Thank you. That was...

17:46.815 --> 17:47.899
That was...

17:48.525 --> 17:49.567
Perfection?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.133
What'd he say that was so funny?

18:14.384 --> 18:17.053
I have absolutely no idea.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.472
That's classic.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.682
My God, you guys.
What am I doing?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.768
This is so un-me.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.520
If you want, I'll do it.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.525
I know. I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.902
But I won't.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.239
God. The first time he smiled at me...

18:36.490 --> 18:40.576
...those three seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.203
Did you rent mopeds?

18:44.373 --> 18:45.832
Because I've heard...

18:46.458 --> 18:48.709
Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.922
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

18:53.173 --> 18:55.675
...and we don't even speak
the same language...

18:55.884 --> 18:57.385
...but, God.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.558
Paolo, hi.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.269
- Ross.
- Listen, uh...

19:10.065 --> 19:13.568
Listen, um, heh,
something you should, uh, know.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.946
Rachel and I are...

19:17.197 --> 19:19.615
We're kind of a thing.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.785
- Thing?
- Thing. Yes, thing.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.288
- You have the sex?
- No.

19:27.249 --> 19:32.545
No, no. Um, technically,
the sex is not being had. But that's, uh...

19:33.255 --> 19:34.714
That's not the point.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.927
The point is that, uh,
Rachel and I should be, uh...

19:40.721 --> 19:43.389
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.474
And if you get in the, uh...

19:46.101 --> 19:47.351
- In bed?
- No.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.480
Ha. No, not where I was going.

19:51.690 --> 19:56.652
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

19:56.904 --> 19:59.739
...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.532
Oh.

20:01.825 --> 20:02.950
So do you, um?

20:09.499 --> 20:12.376
- You do know a little English?
- Little.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.213
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

20:17.090 --> 20:20.301
No? That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.227
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.728
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.359
Okay? Now try it.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.695
You gotta whip it.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.454
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.875
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

20:53.126 --> 20:57.505
...minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48...

20:58.674 --> 21:00.758
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.971
Kind of spooky without any lights.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.147
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.869
Uh, Ross...

21:29.079 --> 21:31.539
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

21:31.790 --> 21:34.333
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.677
- This has been fun.
- Yes.

21:44.928 --> 21:48.306
Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
use your phone...

21:48.724 --> 21:50.599
...and for saving my life.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.602
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.855
I had a great blackout.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.065
See you.

22:13.373 --> 22:19.545
Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that...

22:19.755 --> 22:23.299
...but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
