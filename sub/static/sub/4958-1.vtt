00:18.000 --> 00:21.663
Viv, I know there are only
three shopping days left, but they called...

00:21.737 --> 00:23.931
and they want to see
your house in an hour.

00:24.006 --> 00:25.975
Uh-huh.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.009
Mom! Make Buzz turn off the music.

00:28.076 --> 00:30.067
- No problem.
- Mom!

00:30.145 --> 00:32.136
- "Mom."
- Hang on, Viv.

00:32.214 --> 00:34.148
- Let your sister rehearse.
- Like that'll help.

00:34.216 --> 00:36.151
- And clean up the kitchen.
- But--

00:36.219 --> 00:38.881
Now. Okay, Viv.
I'll see you in a bit.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.014
I thought I told you
to clean up the kitchen.

00:41.090 --> 00:43.683
- I did. Can I go to the movies
tonight with friends?
- No.

00:43.759 --> 00:47.355
- No--
- No, no. I'm showing a house.
I need you to baby-sit Kevin.

00:47.430 --> 00:50.158
- Why can't Megan do it?
- She has to go to rehearsal.

00:50.231 --> 00:53.360
- You don't have to go to the movies.
- I do if I want a life.

00:53.435 --> 00:57.497
You're baby-sitting Kevin.
Where is he, anyway? Kevin.

00:57.574 --> 01:00.065
- What is it? What is it?
- A car!

01:00.142 --> 01:02.201
- Whoa!
- Wait a second. That was--

01:02.277 --> 01:04.404
Honey, that was mine.

01:04.479 --> 01:07.243
Awesome. It's got an antenna and everything.

01:07.316 --> 01:09.876
- Merry Christmas, Mommy.
- Merry Christmas.

01:09.952 --> 01:12.477
Merry Christmas.

01:12.554 --> 01:14.579
- What did I get?
- What is this?

01:14.656 --> 01:17.056
- Thank you.
- Everybody get in the shot.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.617
- Everybody get together.
- Okay.

01:19.696 --> 01:22.358
- Al I right. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:22.432 --> 01:25.265
- Merry Christmas.
- Very funny, Buzz.

01:27.336 --> 01:30.363
- Last Christmas, huh?
- Yeah.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.336
This Christmas isn't
gonna be any fun.

01:35.479 --> 01:38.470
Of course
it will.

01:38.548 --> 01:42.314
Honey, we're gonna do all
the same things we've always done.

01:42.385 --> 01:45.981
Sing Christmas carols,
be with family and friends...

01:46.056 --> 01:49.718
put cookies and milk
out for Santa.

01:49.792 --> 01:53.250
- It's gonna be just the same.
- Except this year...

01:54.289 --> 01:55.424
No Dad.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.782
Right. That's the one thing
that's different.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.014
Why can't you just
get back together?

02:01.089 --> 02:04.957
Honey, we're just gonna have to let that go.

02:05.026 --> 02:08.461
That's a no, right?

02:08.530 --> 02:12.296
It means some things are
just out of our control.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.460
I know you miss your dad.

02:15.638 --> 02:18.106
And he loves me very much.

02:18.174 --> 02:21.234
You both do, and it has
nothing to do with me.

02:21.310 --> 02:25.372
- Did he tell you that?
- I'm nine years old. I watch a lot of TV.

02:27.382 --> 02:29.612
Did he leave
because of me?

02:29.684 --> 02:31.743
No. Of course not.

02:31.820 --> 02:34.983
I knew it. It was Buzz and Megan.

02:36.158 --> 02:40.094
Oh, it wasn't anyone...
or any one thing.

02:40.162 --> 02:42.926
Then what was it?

02:42.998 --> 02:46.865
That's not easy to explain.

02:46.935 --> 02:50.030
But, uh, sometimes when...

02:50.104 --> 02:53.665
people are married for a long time,
they get into kind of a rut.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.804
- You know what a rut is?
- Yeah. Like, when people
aren't having any fun...

02:57.881 --> 02:59.815
and they're really bored.

02:59.883 --> 03:02.351
Kind of like that.

03:02.419 --> 03:04.979
Now, will you
come downstairs?

03:05.055 --> 03:07.044
When you're ready.

03:14.530 --> 03:16.465
Hey!

03:16.533 --> 03:19.365
Wait a second.

03:19.435 --> 03:23.064
- Kevin, come in here.
- Hurry, you've gotta see this!

03:27.743 --> 03:30.439
Ow! Hey! Hey!

03:30.513 --> 03:33.175
- You always fall for that.
- Let me up, zit-face!

03:33.249 --> 03:36.048
- Lamebrain. When are you gonna learn?
- Get off your brother.

03:36.119 --> 03:38.610
And shouldn't you be rehearsing?

03:38.688 --> 03:42.180
- How are you getting to the teen center?
- Ashley's mom's picking me up.

03:42.259 --> 03:44.523
Can I please go to the movies?

03:44.594 --> 03:46.528
No. I told you.
You're watching Kevin.

03:46.596 --> 03:48.928
- Please let him go. I'll stay home alone.
- No.

03:48.999 --> 03:52.366
- I've done it before.
- Don't remind me.

03:53.469 --> 03:56.133
You loused up
my whole night.

03:56.207 --> 03:58.835
And if I'm gonna be miserable,
you're gonna be miserable.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.844
Mom!

04:00.912 --> 04:03.607
- Hello. It's me.
- Dad!

04:03.680 --> 04:05.240
- Dad!
- Hey, big guy.

04:05.317 --> 04:07.977
I didn't know you were coming tonight.

04:08.051 --> 04:10.042
- Oh, I thought I'd surprise you.
- Hey, Dad.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.850
Hey, Buzz.

04:12.923 --> 04:16.654
Oh, Kate. Gosh,
the place looks great.

04:16.726 --> 04:19.218
Really nice decorations.

04:19.297 --> 04:21.288
- Same as every year.
- So, um...

04:21.365 --> 04:23.026
Dad, why'd you
come tonight?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.591
Actually, I want to talk to your mom
about something.

04:27.505 --> 04:30.440
Privately.

04:31.642 --> 04:34.577
- Do you think he wants to come home?
- Aw, Kev.

04:37.649 --> 04:40.083
- What?
- No "Hello, how are ya?"

04:40.152 --> 04:43.019
Sorry. I have a business appointment, Peter.
What do you want?

04:43.088 --> 04:46.080
Okay, gosh.
I wasn't gonna jump right into it, but--

04:46.158 --> 04:50.652
Well, you know Natalie
and I are living together, and, uh...

04:50.729 --> 04:54.426
well, when our divorce is final,
I'm gonna marry her.

04:57.135 --> 04:59.126
Really?

05:00.205 --> 05:02.730
You're getting married again.

05:08.447 --> 05:11.472
Wow. That's, uh--
That--

05:11.549 --> 05:14.177
Wow.
We've only been separated eight months.

05:14.251 --> 05:18.916
Yeah, I-- It just happened real quickly,
and-- Listen, Kate...

05:18.991 --> 05:22.518
I really want the kids to spend
a little time with me over the holidays.

05:22.594 --> 05:24.960
You want the kids for Christmas?

05:25.030 --> 05:28.591
Just a couple of days.
I want them to get to know Natalie better.

05:30.168 --> 05:34.070
Oh, because she's gonna be
their, uh, stepmother.

05:34.139 --> 05:35.903
Yeah.

05:40.346 --> 05:42.610
Well, you're gonna
have to ask them.

05:43.683 --> 05:46.345
I know.

05:46.419 --> 05:49.148
- How am I supposed to see my friends?
- It's only a few days.

05:49.221 --> 05:52.748
Well, duh, but that's just long enough
for me to fall out of the loop.

05:52.824 --> 05:56.386
- Yeah, you can't expect us
to give up our vacation.
- Well, Kevin?

05:57.597 --> 05:59.759
There's a royal family
coming to visit.

05:59.832 --> 06:03.632
They have a son around your age. You might
have a chance to play with a crown prince.

06:03.703 --> 06:06.331
- A crown prince?
- Wouldn't that be cool?

06:06.406 --> 06:09.864
- Yeah, way cool.
- And you guys wouldn't believe the room...

06:09.942 --> 06:12.570
that Natalie has
set up for you.

06:12.645 --> 06:14.545
What do you say?

06:19.253 --> 06:22.689
I think I'm gonna pass.

06:22.756 --> 06:26.351
It just wouldn't be right
leaving the family at Christmas.

06:26.426 --> 06:29.260
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

06:30.731 --> 06:34.167
Well, it's-- it's
an open invitation, hmm?

06:36.737 --> 06:38.830
And I won't be
back too late.

06:38.906 --> 06:42.137
Since you're staying home,
it wouldn't hurt to do some of your chores.

06:42.209 --> 06:45.701
Yes, ma'am.
I'll make sure they get done.

06:56.390 --> 06:58.325
Clean it, cheese-face.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.364
Ow!

07:19.214 --> 07:21.808
Oops.

07:21.883 --> 07:23.816
My fault.

07:31.225 --> 07:33.158
Hello, I'm home.

07:34.596 --> 07:36.961
Hey.

07:37.030 --> 07:38.965
- How'd it go?
- Awful.

07:39.033 --> 07:42.560
I hate Buzz. I never want to be stuck
home alone with him as long as I live.

07:42.637 --> 07:45.902
Oh, honey.
I know he picks on you.

07:45.974 --> 07:48.807
Picks on me?
Humiliates me, tortures me.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.209
I'm sick of being everyone's
favorite joke around here.

07:51.279 --> 07:54.443
Yeah. Yeah,
it's hard to be the youngest.

07:54.517 --> 07:58.385
Well, I hate Buzz.
I wish I didn't have a brother or a sister.

07:58.454 --> 08:01.082
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do!

08:01.157 --> 08:03.454
I wish I was
an only child!

08:07.496 --> 08:11.592
Well, I'm sorry that
you're so unhappy.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.968
Maybe you should go to your room
and think about what you have,
rather than what you don't have.

08:23.645 --> 08:26.478
Only children don't know
how good they have it.

08:26.548 --> 08:30.383
Life would be perfect if
Buzz and Megan weren't around.

08:33.889 --> 08:38.054
I mean, is it too much to ask for
a family who actually likes me?

08:39.863 --> 08:42.457
I'd run away.

08:42.532 --> 08:45.160
If I knew where to run to.

08:47.838 --> 08:50.398
Hey, I do!

08:50.473 --> 08:52.668
I have an open invitation.

08:59.484 --> 09:02.679
Can't get my seat belt unfastened.

09:12.262 --> 09:14.254
Thanks, Alan.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.368
Thanks.

09:19.537 --> 09:21.697
Oh, what an incredible evening.

09:21.771 --> 09:23.704
And not a bad night's work.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.673
We raised over two million
for those children's charities.

09:26.742 --> 09:29.235
Door, open.

09:34.285 --> 09:38.585
And I am on the verge of signing
two of the biggest clients in Chicago.

09:38.656 --> 09:41.955
That's because you're the best publicist
in the world.

09:42.026 --> 09:46.325
- Doors, close.
- Have I remembered to thank you
for telling everyone that?

09:46.396 --> 09:48.388
Fire, light.
Not tonight you haven't.

09:48.466 --> 09:50.457
Perhaps I ought to
show my appreciation.

09:50.534 --> 09:52.593
Music, on.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.162
Curtains, close.

10:00.645 --> 10:05.275
Aw, nuts. Just when
things were getting good.

10:05.349 --> 10:09.945
- Nice house, huh, pumpkin?
- Sure is, Marv.
You sure you don't wanna rob it?

10:11.022 --> 10:12.955
No. No, I don't wanna rob it.

10:13.023 --> 10:17.689
My robbery days are over. Darling, we're
moving up to the big money. All right?

10:17.763 --> 10:19.856
The easy money.
No middleman.

10:19.932 --> 10:23.196
Pure profit. Strictly
a class operation, huh?

10:23.267 --> 10:26.100
Three words, Vera.
Kid-- na-- pping.

10:28.006 --> 10:30.236
I think that's only one word.

10:30.309 --> 10:32.300
We're gonna wait for
the royals to arrive--

10:32.377 --> 10:35.939
hup, dup, dodey-do--
and then we're gonna kidnap the prince.

10:36.015 --> 10:38.984
"Oh, don't kidnap me. I'm fancy."

10:39.053 --> 10:40.986
You sure we can pull it off?

10:41.054 --> 10:42.986
I mean, without
Harry making the plans?

10:43.054 --> 10:46.957
Look where Harry's plans
kept landing me, huh? In jail.

10:47.025 --> 10:49.221
Well, not this time.
Because this time...

10:49.295 --> 10:51.228
I'm the boss.

10:51.296 --> 10:53.196
Who's the boss?

10:53.265 --> 10:56.462
- You're the boss.
- I love being married. Eh?

11:05.678 --> 11:07.908
- That's my girl.
- Hey!

11:07.981 --> 11:10.916
Oh! Looks like
they got a visitor.

11:33.339 --> 11:35.604
This where you want to go?

11:35.676 --> 11:39.372
Yeah, this is the place. Thank you very much.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.503
Keep the change.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.514
It's all change.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.151
Who are you?

12:26.160 --> 12:28.492
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

12:28.562 --> 12:30.496
Yes, Prescott?

12:30.564 --> 12:34.399
Mr. McCallister has a visitor.
The young man claims to be his son.

12:34.469 --> 12:36.663
Well, send him in.

12:40.075 --> 12:42.042
- Kevin!
- Dad!

12:42.109 --> 12:45.546
Hey! Oh! I thought
you said weren't coming.

12:45.613 --> 12:49.606
Well, I started thinking, hey, it's not fair
if Mom gets all the kids for Christmas.

12:49.684 --> 12:51.914
What's Christmas without kids, right?

12:51.986 --> 12:54.285
Right. Hello, Kevin.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.051
Hi, Natalie. I hope you don't mind me
just dropping in like this...

12:57.126 --> 12:59.061
but my dad did invite me.

12:59.129 --> 13:02.153
- Yes, I know.
- Is the invitation still open?

13:02.230 --> 13:06.530
Of course it is.
Molly, would you come here, please?

13:08.304 --> 13:11.330
I've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.568
Your dad talks about
you kids a lot.

13:13.643 --> 13:15.940
Buzz is the troublemaker.
I'm the adorable one.

13:16.011 --> 13:18.674
Oh. Ah, Molly.

13:18.748 --> 13:22.341
This is Kevin McCallister, and he's going
to be staying with us for a few days.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.352
Would you make up
the special guest room?

13:24.420 --> 13:27.048
Ah, the special guest room.

13:27.123 --> 13:29.648
Right away, ma'am.

13:31.793 --> 13:36.093
- Oh, and Prescott, give Kevin a house key.
- If you say so, ma' am.

13:40.768 --> 13:43.100
What kind of key is this?

13:43.171 --> 13:45.231
It's a key to the whole house.

13:45.307 --> 13:48.435
This is a smart house, Kevin.
It does whatever you tell it to.

13:48.511 --> 13:50.570
Fire, out.

13:54.017 --> 13:55.950
Curtains, open.

13:57.654 --> 14:01.885
Wow! I think
I'm gonna like it here.

14:04.294 --> 14:06.284
Go ahead. You try.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.694
Door, open.

14:21.710 --> 14:24.202
Wow! This stuff
is so cool.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.079
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

14:27.150 --> 14:29.675
This is such cool stuff!. Ah!

14:29.753 --> 14:31.880
Oh! Look at this game!

14:32.989 --> 14:36.220
This chair's
a remote control chair! Oh!

14:36.293 --> 14:38.285
Oh, yeah!

14:38.362 --> 14:40.761
This is so cool! Oh!

14:40.830 --> 14:43.298
- Think you’ll be comfortable here?
- I'll say!

14:43.366 --> 14:47.098
Thanks, Natalie.
This is gonna be the best Christmas ever!

14:47.171 --> 14:49.162
Lights out, Kev.

14:50.775 --> 14:53.266
Hey, Kevin?

14:53.344 --> 14:55.972
Kevin.

14:56.047 --> 14:58.140
How many times
can I lose this child?

14:58.216 --> 15:00.581
Kevin.

15:02.284 --> 15:04.447
- Hello.
- Kate, I...

15:04.522 --> 15:06.716
wanted to let you know
Kevin just got here.

15:06.790 --> 15:09.259
Oh, thank God...

15:09.327 --> 15:12.420
he got there... safely.

15:13.432 --> 15:16.093
- I was gonna call you, but uh--
- Are you okay?

15:18.404 --> 15:20.632
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.

15:20.705 --> 15:23.539
Well, thanks for
letting him come.

15:25.310 --> 15:28.610
- Well, thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.209
Merry Christmas.

15:50.001 --> 15:51.935
Good mornin', Kevin.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.938
Good morning.

15:54.006 --> 15:57.533
- Who's there?
- Over here, dear.

15:57.609 --> 16:01.044
Hey. Hi.

16:01.112 --> 16:03.877
Breakfast time.
Anything special you'd like?

16:03.949 --> 16:05.575
Anything?

16:05.650 --> 16:07.585
Anything.

16:33.881 --> 16:36.314
- Wow!
- Sometimes I can't wait for Santa to come...

16:36.382 --> 16:39.179
so I end up doing
some shopping by myself.

16:39.251 --> 16:42.015
- Would you like to open one?
- No, you're gonna spoil him.

16:42.087 --> 16:45.921
Dad, it's her house. If she wants to spoil me,
she can spoil me.

16:45.991 --> 16:48.893
All right. All right.
But just one.

16:48.961 --> 16:50.826
And not...
the biggest one.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.533
Does it really fly?

16:55.601 --> 16:57.762
It really does,
but only outside.

16:57.837 --> 17:00.533
- We don't want to break anything.
- Wow! Thanks, Natalie!

17:04.278 --> 17:07.611
Why do you have to leave?
It's so close to Christmas.

17:07.681 --> 17:11.583
I know, but the royal family's coming
for one of Natalie's fund-raisers...

17:11.652 --> 17:16.146
and it's my job to make sure the event's
well-covered by press and photographers.

17:16.223 --> 17:21.752
Hey, it's not gonna take that long, and I won't
have to work for the rest of your vacation.

17:21.829 --> 17:25.027
And if you need anything, ask Prescott.
He'll take care of you.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.431
It's a cool plane, huh?

17:27.501 --> 17:29.469
I think she's trying
to buy my affection.

17:29.536 --> 17:31.868
- Kevin.
- What?

17:31.939 --> 17:34.465
I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

17:35.609 --> 17:37.543
I'm glad you're here.

18:04.472 --> 18:06.598
Mr. Prescott,
can I ask you a question?

18:08.511 --> 18:11.741
- Yes.
- Can you make a milk shake?

18:17.484 --> 18:19.418
Do you have chocolate?

18:19.486 --> 18:21.954
What? Natalie said
anything I need.

18:22.021 --> 18:25.186
- And you need a milk shake, do you?
- A chocolate one.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.389
- Do you think we’ll have a white Christmas?
- It seems highly unlikely...

18:28.464 --> 18:30.658
given the recent
unseasonable temperatures.

18:30.732 --> 18:33.531
What's this thing?
A mini elevator?

18:34.837 --> 18:36.963
It's called a dumbwaiter.

18:37.038 --> 18:40.166
- Why is it called a waiter?
- Because it carries food.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.471
- Why is it called dumb?
- Because it doesn't speak...

18:42.544 --> 18:44.479
or ask countless
idiotic questions.

19:20.015 --> 19:22.483
Can you read?

19:22.551 --> 19:25.418
The door.
"No Entry."

19:25.488 --> 19:28.425
- What, does that mean me?
- Especially you.

19:35.732 --> 19:39.600
This is the control center from which
I manage this entire household...

19:39.669 --> 19:41.603
as well as
my personal quarters.

19:41.671 --> 19:44.197
Miss Natalie may have
granted you run of her home...

19:44.275 --> 19:47.802
but this is my domain
and strictly off-limits.

19:47.879 --> 19:49.812
Understood?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.806
Any more questions?

19:52.884 --> 19:54.818
Good.

20:06.195 --> 20:08.687
Hey, Molly.
Whatcha doing?

20:08.765 --> 20:10.756
Cleanin' the house.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.396
- Gross.
- Oh, no, no. Not in this house.

20:14.472 --> 20:17.873
Watch. Vacuum, on.

20:23.047 --> 20:27.347
- Vacuum, off.
- Wow! The place even cleans itself!.

20:27.418 --> 20:29.648
Want to see somethin'
really cool?

20:32.223 --> 20:34.158
Open sesame.

20:37.663 --> 20:40.563
Wow! This place is awesome.

20:40.631 --> 20:43.226
Yes, it is.

21:46.933 --> 21:49.026
Music, off?

21:53.506 --> 21:55.495
Music, off.

21:55.573 --> 21:58.805
I'm off to the store.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

21:58.877 --> 22:01.311
And don't pick on
that dear child.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.941
Door, open.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.882
She's out of the house.

22:17.096 --> 22:19.428
All right.
The coast is clear.

22:19.499 --> 22:22.229
- Let's go.
- Wait. Are you sure it's safe?

22:22.302 --> 22:25.202
Pumpkin, would I take you
in there if it wasn't safe?

22:25.271 --> 22:29.867
It's just if the prince don't arrive till tomorrow,
why are we going in there now?

22:29.942 --> 22:32.969
To get the lay of the land.
What doya think, Vera...

22:33.047 --> 22:36.242
we're just gonna go in there tomorrow
and start grabbing kids?

22:36.314 --> 22:39.978
"Ooh, everybody
get in the van." No.

22:40.053 --> 22:44.252
We gotta figure out the where,
the when, the how to get him out of there.

22:44.324 --> 22:46.952
Do you know the secret
to criminal success?

22:47.027 --> 22:49.188
Not getting caught.

22:49.263 --> 22:51.458
Planning. Preparation.
Preparedness.

22:51.532 --> 22:53.796
Be Prepared.
Be a prepared "preperator."

22:53.867 --> 22:56.995
Eh? That's my motto,
and that's why I’m--

22:57.071 --> 23:00.040
- A Boy Scout.
- No. The boss, eh?

23:00.107 --> 23:02.041
- Who's the boss?
- You're the boss!

23:02.109 --> 23:04.044
- Where's the boss?
- Right here.

23:04.112 --> 23:07.013
- Hey. Boss, party of one.
- Right there.

23:07.082 --> 23:09.482
All right.
Let's go, pookie.

23:22.397 --> 23:25.331
No. It can't be!

23:31.439 --> 23:33.600
It is! It's Marv!

23:36.544 --> 23:38.978
Mr. Prescott?
Mr. Prescott, are you there?

23:44.353 --> 23:46.821
Mr. Prescott! Help!

23:56.531 --> 23:59.591
Marv, the alarm is on.

23:59.667 --> 24:02.569
Oh, no.
What are we gonna do?

24:03.572 --> 24:05.562
Watch this, eh?

24:07.443 --> 24:09.433
Oh.

24:11.179 --> 24:13.647
Alarm, off.

24:15.282 --> 24:17.752
- Hmm.
- Door, open.

24:19.888 --> 24:22.756
- Ahh!
- That is one handy gadget.

24:22.825 --> 24:25.258
Well, what's my motto?

24:25.326 --> 24:27.990
You're the boss?

24:28.063 --> 24:30.588
- Be Prepared. Yeah.
- Right.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.899
I married a genius.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.839
What do you think that is?
Is that a turkey ball?

24:41.911 --> 24:44.312
-Just put that down. Like a klepto here.
- All right.

24:44.381 --> 24:48.078
- The prince should be staying
in one of these rooms.
- I think that's an elevator.

24:48.151 --> 24:50.847
- Don't-- You give me such a headache.
- You give me a headache.

24:50.921 --> 24:53.890
- You're giving me a headache.
- You give me a headache.

24:53.957 --> 24:57.358
- Don't push me.
- Door, close.

24:57.427 --> 25:00.156
- You're driving me crazy.
- You're driving me crazy.

25:00.229 --> 25:02.755
- You're driving me--
- Oh, shut up.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.857
Door, open.

25:05.868 --> 25:07.394
- Door, close.
- I love this thing.

25:07.471 --> 25:09.938
Marv--

25:10.006 --> 25:12.497
The door was... shutting.

25:12.576 --> 25:14.941
What's wrong with this thing?
Door, open.

25:23.554 --> 25:25.714
I think there's somebody here.

25:25.789 --> 25:27.725
Anybody in here?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.783
- Well, not now. Shh!
- You shh!

25:29.861 --> 25:32.159
- You shh!
- You shh!

25:36.500 --> 25:38.695
Maybe the prince came early.

26:02.126 --> 26:04.151
What the--

26:13.537 --> 26:16.130
That's it. Come on.

26:20.878 --> 26:22.437
Ow!

26:56.816 --> 26:58.646
Up!

27:02.855 --> 27:05.823
- Come on, honey.
- Uh! Marv!

27:14.533 --> 27:17.003
Ow! Ow! Ow!

27:18.805 --> 27:22.742
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

27:26.847 --> 27:28.837
Mr. Prescott!

27:28.915 --> 27:32.214
Mr. Prescott!

27:37.924 --> 27:41.485
- You!
- Hello, Marv.

27:41.562 --> 27:44.826
Well, long time, no see.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.231
- Huh, kid?
- Is that the prince?

27:47.302 --> 27:50.134
No, that's Kevin. Kevin, Vera.
Vera, Kevin.

27:50.204 --> 27:52.866
If that ain't him, let's get outta here
before somebody sees us.

27:52.940 --> 27:55.203
Yeah. I think we got
the lay of the land.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.438
I'll be back!

27:58.512 --> 28:01.105
- Come on!
- Oh, all right!

28:29.276 --> 28:31.767
House, clean yourself up.

28:31.845 --> 28:34.006
Well, it was worth a try.

28:34.081 --> 28:36.642
Okay, maybe
they won’t be too mad.

28:36.718 --> 28:41.050
I mean, once I tell them what happened,
maybe they'll be okay with it.

28:46.060 --> 28:48.689
- Or maybe not.
- What-- What--

28:48.763 --> 28:52.290
What-- What--

28:52.367 --> 28:54.425
What-- What--

28:56.472 --> 28:59.201
Okay, I know
it looks bad, but--

28:59.274 --> 29:01.573
Honey, what's the--

29:01.644 --> 29:06.843
Kevin, what-- what-- what have you done?

29:06.916 --> 29:09.440
Prescott! Prescott!

29:09.517 --> 29:12.179
- It's not working. I tried.
- Yes, ma'am?

29:12.253 --> 29:15.585
Get up here! Now!

29:15.656 --> 29:19.559
- Well, it wasn't working.
- Kevin, what happened?

29:19.627 --> 29:22.188
It wasn't me.
It was the burglars.

29:22.264 --> 29:25.960
- The burglars?
- Yeah. And I recognized the one guy. Marv.

29:26.034 --> 29:28.435
Did I ever tell you about him?
That's another story.

29:28.504 --> 29:31.667
But the point is they were
gonna rip off your house.

29:31.740 --> 29:35.175
-So you chose instead to trash it?
-No. I was trying to protect it.

29:35.243 --> 29:37.678
- By trashing it?
- What in the name of--

29:37.746 --> 29:39.941
Hey, why didn't you come
when I was calling you?

29:40.015 --> 29:41.813
Prescott...

29:41.885 --> 29:45.320
were you aware of
any burglars here today?

29:45.387 --> 29:47.788
Burglars?

29:47.858 --> 29:51.019
No, ma'am. All the alarms
were on as usual.

29:51.092 --> 29:53.858
Maybe they turned 'em off.
They had one of these, you know.

29:53.930 --> 29:57.093
I saw no intruders, and except for--
beg your pardon, ma'am--

29:57.167 --> 30:01.331
the briefest of bathroom breaks,
my eyes were on the monitors at all times.

30:01.404 --> 30:05.169
How one child could do so much damage
in the time it took me to--

30:05.241 --> 30:07.608
- Well, it's quite beyond me.
- It wasn't me!

30:07.677 --> 30:09.609
Well, there was
no one else here.

30:09.677 --> 30:10.938
- He's lying!
- Am not!

30:11.011 --> 30:12.173
- Are too!
- Am not!

30:12.248 --> 30:14.977
- Are too!
- With all due respect, sir...

30:15.049 --> 30:17.678
I did see Master Kevin
playing with the devices...

30:17.753 --> 30:20.017
as if the house were a big toy.

30:20.089 --> 30:22.615
The only hooligan
here today was your son.

30:22.692 --> 30:25.888
Give us a minute.

30:28.899 --> 30:31.424
Kevin.

30:41.212 --> 30:43.203
- Kevin, sit.
- Dad--

30:45.682 --> 30:49.082
- What's going on?
- I told you. The burglars broke into the house.

30:49.151 --> 30:52.747
Kevin, you know I can forgive
just about anything but lying.

30:52.822 --> 30:56.520
Oh, right. So you wouldn't get mad
if I wrecked the place, which I didn't...

30:56.594 --> 30:58.527
as long as
I admit that I did...

30:58.595 --> 31:00.586
which I didn't?

31:02.099 --> 31:05.795
Well, I thought
this over and, uh...

31:05.869 --> 31:08.770
I understand that this is
a difficult adjustment for you.

31:08.838 --> 31:11.774
It's only natural that you'd be acting out.
It's a need for attention.

31:11.842 --> 31:13.673
- No, it isn't.
- Kevin!

31:13.744 --> 31:16.373
Anyway--

31:17.448 --> 31:21.044
Anyway,
what's a little damage?

31:21.119 --> 31:23.883
It's not as if
I'm not insured.

31:23.956 --> 31:25.946
Do you have something to say?

31:26.024 --> 31:28.457
Thank you.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.492
- And?
- I'm sorry for the damage of your house.

32:14.071 --> 32:17.167
The security cameras must have
got the whole thing on tape.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.107
What?

32:23.182 --> 32:25.615
Prescott must have
turned off the cameras.

32:29.687 --> 32:32.213
It's unbelievable.

32:32.291 --> 32:34.724
It is not to be believed!

32:36.195 --> 32:38.458
I can't believe this!

32:38.530 --> 32:40.521
It's the lousy kid again.

32:40.599 --> 32:43.364
Everywhere I break into!

32:43.436 --> 32:46.372
It's like he's stalking me
or something.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.429
Come on, Marv.
He's just a little boy.

32:48.507 --> 32:50.839
Yeah, well, I got
big scars from that little--

32:52.412 --> 32:54.003
Never mind.

32:55.247 --> 32:57.183
I'll tell you one thing...

32:57.251 --> 32:59.616
this time he's
not gonna mess me up.

32:59.686 --> 33:04.419
- Mm-hmm.
- This time it's all gonna go smooth as silk.

33:04.490 --> 33:07.584
Because this time...

33:07.660 --> 33:09.821
I got an inside man.

33:13.167 --> 33:15.191
Oh.

33:21.942 --> 33:24.068
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

33:24.143 --> 33:27.237
- Hey, come on!
Watch the road! Safety first.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.846
What are you doing here?

33:58.913 --> 34:03.351
- Tell me.
- I, uh-- I--

34:04.753 --> 34:06.687
Nothing. I swear.

34:06.755 --> 34:09.917
I thought all of this was cool.
I wanted to take a look at it.

34:09.989 --> 34:14.255
You don't go to other people's homes
uninvited, and you don't touch their things.

34:14.328 --> 34:17.696
Didn't I warn you what would happen
if I ever caught you in here again?

34:17.766 --> 34:19.699
Not specifically.

34:21.902 --> 34:24.268
Trust me.
It won't be pleasant.

34:24.338 --> 34:27.069
What do you want?

34:27.141 --> 34:29.871
I thought I heard
the boy. Ah!

34:29.943 --> 34:31.878
And indeed I did.

34:31.946 --> 34:35.541
I don't want him bothering you anymore,
so I'll just get him out of your way.

34:35.617 --> 34:37.551
Come along, Kevin.

34:40.487 --> 34:43.458
He'll be my responsibility
from now on.

34:50.532 --> 34:53.467
Thank you for
saving me, Molly.

34:53.536 --> 34:56.766
Prescott is a good person
to stay away from.

34:56.839 --> 34:59.534
You're telling me.
He's one of the bad guys--

34:59.607 --> 35:01.701
the bad guys who
broke into the house.

35:01.777 --> 35:06.680
Although technically they didn't break in,
because they had their own remote.

35:06.749 --> 35:09.842
- And who do you think gave them that?
- Prescott?

35:09.918 --> 35:12.979
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds a bit far-fetched to me.

35:13.055 --> 35:16.583
I know. And you probably think
I have an overactive imagination.

35:16.660 --> 35:19.856
Most people do.
But you have to believe me.

35:19.929 --> 35:23.922
Kevin, Prescott is a lonely man.
The only thing he has is this job.

35:23.999 --> 35:26.195
Between you and me,
he hates working here.

35:26.269 --> 35:29.669
- But to do what you're suggesting--
- Then it all makes perfect sense.

35:29.738 --> 35:33.607
He hates his job, so he tries to pull off
a big heist so he can afford to quit.

35:33.677 --> 35:35.907
- Ah, I don't know.
- Listen.

35:35.980 --> 35:38.413
He told my dad I was lying
when I wasn't.

35:38.482 --> 35:42.317
And he shut off the security cameras.
So it can only mean one thing.

35:42.386 --> 35:45.446
- And that is?
- Marv and his new friend...

35:45.523 --> 35:47.455
have an inside guy--

35:47.523 --> 35:51.085
- Prescott.
- I think you’re right.

35:51.161 --> 35:55.495
- I am?
- Yeah. You do have an overactive imagination.

35:57.834 --> 36:00.268
But that's what I love
about children.

36:00.337 --> 36:04.706
My own son was the same
as you at your age-- a real handful.

36:04.774 --> 36:06.743
You must have been
a great mom, Molly.

36:09.145 --> 36:13.378
Well, you just try to keep
that imagination under control, okay?

36:18.723 --> 36:21.488
You were very understanding
about what happened today.

36:21.560 --> 36:25.255
Well, Kevin's going through
a difficult time.

36:25.328 --> 36:27.421
It's not easy
when your parents split up.

36:27.497 --> 36:29.431
Believe me, I know.

36:29.499 --> 36:31.627
But we'll get through it.

36:31.702 --> 36:34.192
You're gonna be
a great stepmom.

36:36.541 --> 36:41.308
I think we just need to figure out
a way to make him feel more at home here.

36:41.379 --> 36:45.007
Maybe do some of the Christmas things
he's used to doing, like trimming the tree.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.915
- You do that yourself?
- Yes, I do that myself.

36:48.985 --> 36:52.820
It's fun. That's exactly what we're gonna do.
We're gonna trim the tree.

36:52.890 --> 36:55.917
It'll get us in the spirit
of things, unite us as a family.

36:55.994 --> 36:57.927
- Okay.
- Okay?

36:57.995 --> 37:03.627
No friends, no fun, no snow.

37:03.701 --> 37:07.000
This is definitely gonna be
the worst Christmas ever.

37:09.307 --> 37:11.503
Hey, Kev.
How you doing?

37:20.787 --> 37:23.687
What do you say we forget
about today and start over, huh?

37:23.755 --> 37:26.622
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

37:26.692 --> 37:29.717
Natalie's really a great person.
You just gotta get to know her better.

37:31.196 --> 37:33.993
I think we should start having
a little more fun around here.

37:34.065 --> 37:36.331
- I could live with that.
- Yeah?

37:36.402 --> 37:38.335
Why don't we start
by trimming that tree?

37:38.403 --> 37:40.234
- Now?
- Sure. Why not?

38:49.208 --> 38:51.871
Hello.

38:51.945 --> 38:55.005
I can't hear you.
Can you turn down the music?

38:58.652 --> 39:01.588
Music, off.

39:01.656 --> 39:03.679
What did you say?

39:03.756 --> 39:06.055
Of course we'll be there.
We wouldn't miss it.

39:06.126 --> 39:09.253
Let me call you back.

39:09.328 --> 39:13.129
Evangelista's in town. Margaret's throwing
together a little impromptu supper...

39:13.200 --> 39:15.361
but we shouldn't go,
should we?

39:15.436 --> 39:19.236
Well, why don’t you go ahead without me,
and Kevin and I will finish up over here?

39:19.306 --> 39:21.275
Really? You wouldn't mind?

39:21.342 --> 39:24.275
No. They’re your friends anyway.

39:24.343 --> 39:27.472
You're an angel.
I won't be home late.

39:30.518 --> 39:32.986
Okay.

39:33.054 --> 39:35.284
Where were we?

39:35.356 --> 39:39.794
- You don't have to stay because of me.
- No, I want to stay. Really.

39:39.862 --> 39:42.160
So, does Natalie go out
every night?

39:42.231 --> 39:47.190
Pretty much. She leads a very exciting life--
more exciting than we're used to.

39:47.268 --> 39:49.429
So you'd say
you're not in a rut?

39:49.504 --> 39:51.700
No, I'm not in a rut. Why?

39:52.775 --> 39:54.708
I thought maybe
that's why you left.

39:54.777 --> 39:57.745
Kevin. Kevin, you know--

39:59.180 --> 40:02.776
I didn't leave your mom
to be with Natalie, okay?

40:02.852 --> 40:06.344
- That just kind of happened later.
- You wanna tell me about it?

40:08.022 --> 40:12.187
Adult relationships are just complicated.

40:12.261 --> 40:15.789
Sometimes when two people get married
really young like your mom and I did...

40:15.866 --> 40:17.628
you just end up
feeling kind of--

40:17.700 --> 40:20.329
- You missed out on some things.
- Yeah.

40:20.403 --> 40:22.337
Just 'cause you grow up
on the outside...

40:22.405 --> 40:24.462
doesn't mean you wanna
stop having fun.

40:24.539 --> 40:26.599
I know all about
the inner child, Dad.

40:26.675 --> 40:30.407
- Oh. You do, huh?
- That's why old guys drive sports cars.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.505
You're probably right.

40:32.582 --> 40:36.779
But the trouble with sports cars--
no room for anybody else.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.789
Maybe one other person max.
But if you want to take a real road trip...

40:40.857 --> 40:43.688
with luggage and all,
you don't even have room for a friend.

40:43.758 --> 40:46.193
I mean, they're
cool and fast and all...

40:46.262 --> 40:49.789
but who wants to be in a nice car
when you're all alone?

41:06.449 --> 41:09.940
Well, that looks
just about perfect.

41:10.019 --> 41:12.545
All that's left to do now
is put on the star.

41:12.622 --> 41:14.681
Kevin always puts on the star.

41:14.758 --> 41:16.851
That's right.
He does, doesn't he?

41:16.927 --> 41:19.761
I always hold him up.
And then I give him a wedgie.

41:19.830 --> 41:23.095
He makes a fuss. We all laugh.

41:24.734 --> 41:27.931
Well, I guess we're just gonna
have to use the ladder this year.

41:30.474 --> 41:33.203
Okay, Dad, you can
put me down now.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.376
Wow. Looks pretty good.

41:37.447 --> 41:39.575
I think it looks great.

41:39.650 --> 41:42.015
I think it's
our best tree yet.

41:44.621 --> 41:46.919
Hey!

41:51.829 --> 41:54.160
- Merry Christmas, Mommy.
- Merry Christmas.

41:54.231 --> 41:57.599
Merry Christmas.

41:57.668 --> 42:01.002
Oh! Look at that!

42:01.073 --> 42:03.596
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

42:03.673 --> 42:07.166
I had this little
computer chip installed in Mom.

42:07.245 --> 42:09.646
We're gonna get her
to make some breakfast.

42:16.922 --> 42:19.391
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

42:24.963 --> 42:27.760
Good morning, sleepyheads.
You're finally up.

42:27.832 --> 42:29.800
What did you do
to our tree?

42:29.867 --> 42:34.133
Oh, that's my fault. I have
a standing appointment with
the tree decorators every year.

42:34.205 --> 42:37.436
In all the excitement,
I forgot to cancel.

42:37.508 --> 42:39.477
Are you ever
gonna forgive me?

42:39.544 --> 42:41.909
You undid our tree?

42:41.979 --> 42:45.608
Well, it would have had
to come down eventually anyway.

42:45.684 --> 42:48.208
Come on, Kev.
Look at all these presents, huh?

42:48.286 --> 42:51.313
Oh, wait. Ooh, here's a big one.
I believe it has--

42:51.390 --> 42:53.323
Yes, it has
your name on it.

42:53.391 --> 42:56.191
Come on. Open it up.
It's from Natalie and me.

42:56.262 --> 42:58.957
But shouldn't I open it
tomorrow on Christmas?

42:59.031 --> 43:02.125
Ah, you got plenty to open tomorrow.
Come on. One won't hurt.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.135
Go ahead.

43:05.203 --> 43:07.694
Super Spy bugging and listening device.

43:07.773 --> 43:12.302
- Isn't that cool?
- Yeah. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Natalie.

43:12.378 --> 43:15.040
I'm glad you like it.

43:21.153 --> 43:24.281
- Hey, Mom, where are you going?
- I'm going to take Kevin some things.

43:24.356 --> 43:27.382
- Mom, where you going?
- He doesn't have any clean clothes...

43:27.459 --> 43:30.293
and I'm sure he doesn't have
any toys to play with.

43:31.564 --> 43:34.624
To check out Dad's girlfriend.
Wanna go?

43:40.974 --> 43:42.908
May I help you?

43:42.975 --> 43:44.910
- Wow!
- I'm here for Kevin McCallister.

43:44.978 --> 43:46.912
- Wow!
- Buzz.

43:46.980 --> 43:49.973
- Are you here to take him home?
- No, I have something for him.

43:50.050 --> 43:52.883
Right this way.

43:52.952 --> 43:55.080
You should be able to hear that.

43:55.155 --> 43:57.817
- How do I sound?
- Kids, stay close.

43:59.294 --> 44:02.285
- Mom!
- Hey!

44:02.363 --> 44:04.854
Hey!

44:04.932 --> 44:08.162
Mmm! Ohh!

44:08.234 --> 44:10.726
You guys remember Natalie, right?

44:10.804 --> 44:12.795
- Buzz, Megan.
- Hi, Natalie.

44:12.872 --> 44:16.037
Oh, and, uh,
Kate, this is Natalie.

44:16.111 --> 44:18.544
- Natalie, Kate.
- Hello, Kate.

44:18.612 --> 44:21.206
Hello.

44:21.281 --> 44:24.078
So, are you guys gonna stay?

44:24.151 --> 44:27.348
- No, I just brought you some of your stuff.
- You guys gotta see this house.

44:27.421 --> 44:30.823
- Is that okay, Natalie?
- Of course. Be my guest.

44:33.594 --> 44:36.087
- Awesome tree!
- It used to look better.

44:36.165 --> 44:40.692
- What is this thing on your head?
- A spy kit that Natalie got me
for an early Christmas present.

44:40.769 --> 44:43.759
Really?
That was nice of you.

44:43.836 --> 44:46.102
Well, I'm very fond
of your kids.

44:46.173 --> 44:48.266
I've gotta show you
this airplane she got me.

44:53.380 --> 44:55.315
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

44:55.383 --> 44:57.350
Oh, no, thank you.

44:57.418 --> 45:01.149
- I, uh, didn't know he would have
all this stuff to play with.
- Yeah.

45:02.256 --> 45:05.020
Oh, God. Hey.
Let me get that.

45:05.092 --> 45:07.390
I wasn't even sure he could
even sleep without it.

45:07.461 --> 45:10.693
Gosh. I cannot believe
he hasn't even asked for it.

45:10.765 --> 45:13.164
Well, we could buy him
another stuffed animal.

45:13.233 --> 45:14.929
- Oh, no, no.
- No.

45:15.003 --> 45:16.868
This is, uh, his Teddy.

45:16.938 --> 45:19.169
Teddy is his
transitional object.

45:19.241 --> 45:22.334
Yeah.
Transitional object.

45:22.410 --> 45:26.403
It's like something very, very special
a child carries with him everywhere.

45:26.481 --> 45:29.575
You're supposed to have a spare,
in case something happens to it.

45:29.652 --> 45:33.485
- Of course, we only had one, remember?
- Oh! How could I forget?

45:33.555 --> 45:37.424
We were driving down the highway,
really in a hurry.

45:37.493 --> 45:40.587
Kevin thinks, possibly Teddy
might want a little fresh air.

45:40.663 --> 45:43.324
So he rolls down the window
and out flies Teddy!

45:43.398 --> 45:45.890
He was ballistic.
He was crying. He was so upset.

45:45.968 --> 45:47.901
It was-- Oh, my--

45:47.969 --> 45:51.133
So Peter pulls over,
and I get out to retrieve the bear.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.674
I still can't believe you did that.

45:53.741 --> 45:56.609
Well, it was the slow lane,
and there wasn't much traffic.

45:56.679 --> 46:00.137
Yeah, well, I don't know what
he would have done if he had lost it.

46:04.019 --> 46:07.147
I think Kevin's going to have
so much fun playing with the prince...

46:07.223 --> 46:09.384
that he's not even gonna
miss the stuffed animal.

46:09.458 --> 46:12.916
It's going to be wonderful having a house
full of children. I'm looking forward to it.

46:12.995 --> 46:16.397
Children, watch
the garden sculpture!

46:16.466 --> 46:20.232
Well, I... better get going.

46:25.175 --> 46:27.575
Before they break something.

46:33.650 --> 46:36.585
Well, we're off to the airport
to pick up the royal family.

46:36.653 --> 46:39.053
You all know
how important this is.

46:39.122 --> 46:41.750
Now, the caterers
will be here momentarily.

46:41.825 --> 46:44.316
And the guests will arrive
about an hour before...

46:44.394 --> 46:47.362
- you and the royals
make your grand entrance.
- No need to worry.

46:47.429 --> 46:49.864
Everything will be
taken care of.

46:49.933 --> 46:53.493
- It's just that I want everything to go right.
- Come on. Let's not be late.

46:53.569 --> 46:57.438
I don't want one single thing to go wrong.
Door, open.

46:57.507 --> 47:00.135
And nothing will.

47:38.649 --> 47:40.640
Oh, good. You've finally arrived.

47:55.367 --> 47:58.894
- Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! It's them!
- Hush, you.

47:58.971 --> 48:00.871
- I'll get him out of your way.
- Thank you.

48:00.939 --> 48:04.568
It's the burglars! It's the burglars!
Aah! Mr. Prescott!

48:04.643 --> 48:06.668
It's Marv!

48:06.745 --> 48:09.408
I guess you already
knew that though.

48:09.482 --> 48:14.215
Listen, you. I have just about had
enough of you and your melodrama!

48:14.287 --> 48:18.312
This is a very important night, and if I have
to lock you up to keep you out of our way...

48:18.389 --> 48:20.551
- don't think I won't do it.
- Look!

48:21.226 --> 48:23.956
Ow!

48:24.029 --> 48:27.226
Ow! Ow!

48:27.299 --> 48:30.599
Don't trifle with me,
you demon spawn!

48:33.105 --> 48:37.509
Now that's a foolish place to hide.

48:48.522 --> 48:51.753
One down, two to go.

48:51.824 --> 48:54.122
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

48:54.193 --> 48:56.320
It's freezing cold!
Let me out!

49:11.844 --> 49:15.007
Kevin, have you seen Prescott?

49:15.081 --> 49:17.072
- Not lately.
- Ah, typical.

49:17.149 --> 49:19.140
Always poking around
when you don't want him...

49:19.217 --> 49:22.187
- and when you need him--
nowhere to be found.

49:22.255 --> 49:26.692
Ah! Guests already?
Whatever happened to fashionably late?

49:30.164 --> 49:32.631
Well, I don't like to boast, but...

49:32.699 --> 49:36.261
yes, it will be the party of the season.

49:36.337 --> 49:39.773
Oh, I'm getting another call.
All right. See you there.

49:39.840 --> 49:44.675
Hello? Carmelina, how are you?

49:44.745 --> 49:48.272
What? Oh, no!

49:48.350 --> 49:52.081
They're snowed in.
Their flight's been canceled.

49:52.153 --> 49:54.644
Well, so am I. Devastated.

49:54.723 --> 49:57.519
Well, all right.
We'll see you tomorrow.

49:57.590 --> 49:59.456
Merry Christmas.

50:01.929 --> 50:05.422
What are we gonna do now?
It's gonna be just an ordinary party.

50:05.500 --> 50:09.459
Christmas Eve at your place
sounds anything but ordinary to me.

50:09.537 --> 50:12.233
It's hardly the party
of the season.

50:14.843 --> 50:16.901
Peter.

50:16.977 --> 50:20.072
- What if we announce
our engagement tonight?
- Tonight?

50:21.583 --> 50:24.245
I know we were gonna wait till
after your divorce was final...

50:24.319 --> 50:27.516
but it's only a few weeks away
and your kids already know...

50:27.589 --> 50:30.024
and it'll make tonight
so special.

50:30.092 --> 50:32.219
Well, if it makes you happy.

50:32.293 --> 50:34.319
Yes!

50:40.503 --> 50:42.436
Where are those guys?

50:42.504 --> 50:46.634
- Marv, I gotta tinkle.
- Vera, you can tinkle next week.

50:46.708 --> 50:48.700
Always in a hurry.

50:48.778 --> 50:51.144
Door, open.

50:55.651 --> 50:57.674
All right.
Now, you remember the plan?

50:57.751 --> 51:00.778
- Which plan? Harry's plan?
- What-- No! Not Harry's plan!

51:00.855 --> 51:03.653
- The one involving rope and a bag!
- Why are you yelling at me?

51:03.725 --> 51:05.659
I'm not yell--

51:05.727 --> 51:08.093
- Do you remember the plan?
- Yeah.

51:08.164 --> 51:11.065
- Now, when the prince comes up to bed--
- We bag him!

51:11.133 --> 51:15.967
- That's right. We kidnap the kid napping.
- You're a genius, Marv.

51:16.037 --> 51:19.496
That's right.
Door, open.

51:19.575 --> 51:22.634
Now, the prince goes
in the bag.

51:22.710 --> 51:26.613
- The bag goes out the window.
- Uh-huh.

51:26.682 --> 51:29.618
We climb down the rope.
Door, close.

51:29.686 --> 51:30.914
Right.

51:30.987 --> 51:33.956
Everybody in the van.

51:36.291 --> 51:39.261
And we're gone before
they know what hit 'em.

51:39.328 --> 51:43.458
Beautiful plan, Marv.
Elegant in its simplicity.

51:43.532 --> 51:47.559
All right. Let's try it out.
Get in the bag.

51:47.636 --> 51:49.628
Me? Why don't you
get in the bag?

51:49.706 --> 51:51.833
Because I'm the boss.
Get in the bag, Vera.

51:51.908 --> 51:54.934
- I don't wanna get in the bag.
- Vera, just get in the bag! Please!

51:55.011 --> 51:57.342
You didn't tell me
I was gonna get in no bag.

51:57.413 --> 52:00.383
I was saving it. It's gonna be fun.
Ooh, we're in the bag!

52:02.485 --> 52:05.217
Nice. All right.

52:05.289 --> 52:08.224
Window, open.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.192
Ahh.

52:13.531 --> 52:15.964
Uh, Marv. Ooh. Oh.

52:16.032 --> 52:19.730
Don't worry, honey. I got ya.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.237
Marv! Let me down easy.

52:22.305 --> 52:25.570
I always do, baby.

52:25.642 --> 52:28.111
Shouldn't have had
that last piece of cake.

52:34.919 --> 52:37.580
- Perfect.
- Door, open.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.990
Don't worry.

52:46.063 --> 52:48.123
Everything's under control.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.168
Uh, uh, Marv--

52:53.872 --> 52:55.702
Easy...

52:55.773 --> 52:58.265
but still way cool.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.584
Thanks for breaking
my fall, pumpkin.

53:08.654 --> 53:11.214
I always do, baby. Okay.

53:11.290 --> 53:13.224
Get out and stay out!

53:19.430 --> 53:23.196
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Oh, yeah, wise guy? What?

53:23.267 --> 53:26.703
You're trying to
kidnap the prince.

53:29.875 --> 53:32.810
Shut up,
ya little moron!

53:34.745 --> 53:37.407
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Okay.

53:49.629 --> 53:53.292
Vera, honey.
Little help?

53:53.366 --> 53:56.232
Oh, yeah, baby. That'd be great.
I sure could use it.

54:03.977 --> 54:07.002
I got every word.

54:12.719 --> 54:16.051
- Welcome back. Where's the royal family?
- They were snowed in.

54:16.121 --> 54:18.681
- Ah!
- Where's Prescott?

54:18.758 --> 54:20.988
- I can't find him anywhere.
- That's odd.

54:21.060 --> 54:24.723
Well, Molly, make sure
everyone has champagne.

54:24.797 --> 54:27.699
- We're going to make
a special announcement.
- Yes, ma'am.

54:40.314 --> 54:43.613
- How are you?
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you again.

54:45.186 --> 54:47.176
Everyone, may I have
your attention?

54:47.254 --> 54:48.950
Huh?

54:50.659 --> 54:53.786
I am gonna kill that--

54:53.861 --> 54:56.090
Uuh!

55:15.149 --> 55:19.176
This is always a special night,
and tonight may be even more special.

55:19.253 --> 55:22.085
Get him!

55:23.557 --> 55:26.287
Peter and I are engaged!

55:42.644 --> 55:45.373
Prescott?

55:45.446 --> 55:48.905
This could not be goin' worse.

55:48.983 --> 55:51.713
Marv, you're on fire.

55:51.785 --> 55:54.049
Oh, thanks, baby.
You're not so bad yourself.

55:54.121 --> 55:57.056
No, sweetheart.
You're really on fire.

55:57.124 --> 56:00.219
Well, I try to work out.
You know-- Aah!

56:00.295 --> 56:02.627
Gaah! Aah!

56:02.697 --> 56:07.157
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Kevin!

56:11.806 --> 56:15.004
I'm not lying.
The bad guys are back.

56:15.076 --> 56:17.044
We're not getting anywhere.

56:18.714 --> 56:23.174
Kevin, I spoke to
all the caterers and to Molly.

56:23.252 --> 56:27.154
Nobody saw a thing but you.
Now, how could that be?

56:27.223 --> 56:30.284
I don't know.
But I heard they're gonna kidnap the prince.

56:30.360 --> 56:34.455
- You heard them say that?
- Yeah, with my Super Spybugging device.

56:34.530 --> 56:37.863
- And Prescott's involved with the whole thing.
- This is absurd.

56:37.933 --> 56:42.370
I'm going to call and make sure
the royal family's flight is okay for tomorrow.

56:44.540 --> 56:46.872
Kevin, I know
what's going on here.

56:46.942 --> 56:49.207
- You do?
- Yeah.

56:49.279 --> 56:53.442
- You're out to destroy
my relationship with Natalie.
- What?

56:53.516 --> 56:57.179
You knew how important tonight was to her,
and you went and pulled a crazy stunt like this.

56:57.253 --> 56:59.586
- That's not the truth.
- I've given you a lot of leeway...

56:59.656 --> 57:03.148
because I know how tough
this divorce has been on you.

57:03.226 --> 57:06.161
But tonight you went
way too far.

57:06.229 --> 57:08.790
I want you to go to your room
and think about what you've done.

57:11.734 --> 57:14.897
And when you're ready to apologize to Natalie,
then we'll talk.

57:20.076 --> 57:22.306
Door, close.

57:35.157 --> 57:38.992
Here you are, George! Merry Christmas!

57:48.539 --> 57:51.269
- Hello?
- Mom?

57:51.342 --> 57:55.209
Kevin! Oh, Kevin.
I'm so glad you called.

57:55.278 --> 57:57.713
Are you okay?

57:57.782 --> 58:01.343
Yeah, yeah. I'm just watching
It's a Wonderful Life.

58:01.419 --> 58:04.855
- You are?
- You know how that gets to me.

58:04.922 --> 58:06.947
- What channel is it on?
- Eight.

58:13.464 --> 58:16.023
Ohh.

58:16.099 --> 58:18.466
I guess I'm just a sucker
for happy endings.

58:20.805 --> 58:23.433
So, how is your party?
Are you havin' a good time?

58:23.507 --> 58:27.808
Yeah, it's all right. How about you?
Havin' a good Christmas Eve?

58:32.350 --> 58:35.410
Yeah. It's great.

58:37.789 --> 58:41.519
- I love you, Kevin.
- Love you too, Mom.

58:41.592 --> 58:44.084
Merry Christmas.

58:44.162 --> 58:47.758
- Merry Christmas.
- Okay. Bye.

59:05.417 --> 59:08.353
- Kevin, are you awake?
- Yeah.

59:12.824 --> 59:15.452
Your father and I were a little rough
on you before. Are you okay?

59:15.527 --> 59:18.222
- Yeah.
- Good.

59:18.297 --> 59:21.629
Because if you ever do anything like that again,
you'll be out of this house so fast...

59:21.699 --> 59:23.691
your head will spin.

59:23.769 --> 59:27.262
So your father's getting divorced. Boo-hoo.
Everyone's parents get divorced.

59:27.340 --> 59:31.332
That's life. You'll get over it. But you're not
gonna come between your father and me.

59:31.410 --> 59:35.403
He wants you in his life,
and I think that's admirable.

59:35.480 --> 59:39.781
But if you want him in your life,
you better not cross me.

59:39.852 --> 59:44.551
Understood? Good.

59:47.962 --> 59:51.954
I'll have that window fixed first thing
in the morning. Sweet dreams.

59:56.601 --> 59:59.730
To my big brother George,
the richest man in town.

01:00:04.344 --> 01:00:07.405
I've just had
a nice little chat with Kevin.

01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:11.415
I think we're beginning to understand
each other better. What are you watching?

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:14.385
It's a Wonderful Life.
They've been running it all night.

01:00:14.454 --> 01:00:16.821
- Come on. Watch it with me.
- I've seen it.

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.825
- So?
- So...

01:00:19.893 --> 01:00:23.454
I don't understand people who
watch movies over and over again.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:26.226
I saw it. I cried.
Once was enough.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.532
You gotta be kidding.
Kate and I watch this every year with the kids.

01:00:29.604 --> 01:00:31.935
It's a family tradition.

01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:34.304
Well...

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:39.177
now that you're going to have a new family,
maybe it's time for some new traditions.

01:00:48.323 --> 01:00:51.586
They'll be back.
And if no one believes me...

01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:54.491
I'll have to catch 'em myself.

01:01:14.983 --> 01:01:18.147
Shut up, you little moron.

01:01:22.223 --> 01:01:25.192
Shut up, you moron.

01:01:28.097 --> 01:01:31.657
Okay, stop.

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:34.224
Spin Faster.

01:01:37.172 --> 01:01:41.403
Get in the bag. Shut up, ya bag!

01:01:54.389 --> 01:01:57.757
- Christmas morning.
- Merry Christmas, Kevin.

01:01:57.827 --> 01:02:00.352
- Merry Christmas, Dad!
- Hey, hey!

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:04.592
- Peter, are you ready to go?
- Go? Go where?

01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:09.366
Kevin, Natalie and I gotta go
pick up the royal family right now.

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:12.965
Now? But aren't we
gonna open presents?

01:02:13.042 --> 01:02:15.476
It's gonna have to wait
till we get back.

01:02:15.544 --> 01:02:18.946
But it's Christmas.
And why do you both have to go?

01:02:19.015 --> 01:02:22.416
Look, you know how sometimes
you gotta do things you don't wanna do?

01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:26.148
This is one of those times.
Hey, we'll be back before you know it, okay?

01:02:26.222 --> 01:02:28.691
And I'm sure nothing will happen
while we're gone. Am I right?

01:02:28.758 --> 01:02:30.952
- Right.
- Good.

01:02:32.128 --> 01:02:35.723
Hang in there.
We won't be long.

01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:38.563
Door, open.

01:02:41.337 --> 01:02:43.397
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

01:02:48.612 --> 01:02:50.603
Merry Christmas.

01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:07.264
Hello?

01:03:09.767 --> 01:03:12.395
- No, we're awake.
- It wasn't me!

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:15.666
Shh! All right.
We're on our way.

01:03:15.739 --> 01:03:18.937
Oy. Sure makes me nervous.

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.239
Let's go, pookie.

01:03:26.317 --> 01:03:29.217
I knew it. Here they come.

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:44.024
First step-- eliminate the inside man.
Oh, Mr. Prescott?

01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:46.764
Mr. Prescott, are you in there?

01:03:48.306 --> 01:03:50.240
- Yes.
- Mr. Prescott...

01:03:50.308 --> 01:03:52.970
- can you help me with something?
- And what would that be?

01:03:53.044 --> 01:03:55.808
- Another milk shake, perhaps?
- No. A bottle of wine.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.009
- Excuse me?
- Natalie said we need to get
some wine from the basement...

01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:01.348
for the royal family.

01:04:02.654 --> 01:04:04.883
If we must.

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:08.085
So I guess you're right.

01:04:08.159 --> 01:04:10.593
We're not gonna have
any snow this Christmas.

01:04:10.661 --> 01:04:14.097
One can never go wrong
with low expectations.

01:04:14.165 --> 01:04:18.398
You know, Mr. Prescott, it's been great
spending time with you these last few days.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.904
Time flies when
you're having fun.

01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:26.276
I know we got off to a bad start,
but things can be better-- much better.

01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:32.247
- 'Cause you're down there, and I'm up here.
- Come get--

01:04:32.317 --> 01:04:34.546
- Young man, open this door!
Let me out of here!

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.590
- Oh!
- Oh, boy! Am I glad to see you!

01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:40.785
The kidnappers are coming.
But this time I'm one step ahead of them.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.193
I locked their accomplice in the basement.
Is this a perfect plan, or what?

01:04:44.264 --> 01:04:46.460
It would be, dear,
except for one thing--

01:04:46.533 --> 01:04:49.228
Prescott is not
their accomplice.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.405
I am.

01:04:54.473 --> 01:04:59.411
You're-- You're the inside man?

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:02.778
- I'm afraid so.
- Hey, Mom.

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:08.913
We're here.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:14.790
- Mom? He's your son?
- I told you he was a handful.

01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:17.763
- Aah! Hey! Get off of me!
- Oh, now, come on!

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.401
Isn't there a trapdoor
or something?

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:28.430
No. Not much demand for 'em
in a wine cellar.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.572
Guess you're right.

01:05:32.645 --> 01:05:35.011
Got any good ideas?

01:05:36.283 --> 01:05:38.410
Not a one.

01:05:45.258 --> 01:05:49.558
- I do have a cell phone though.
- Perfect! May I?

01:05:49.629 --> 01:05:51.620
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:05:57.171 --> 01:05:59.332
- Hello, Buzz?
- Kevin, is that you?

01:05:59.406 --> 01:06:01.966
- Yeah. I'm calling from a cell phone.
- Oh, a cell phone.

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:06.036
Good for you, puke-face. Is that another
present she gave you? What a showoff.

01:06:08.115 --> 01:06:11.050
I'll try again.

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:19.085
Buzz, before you hang up, I need to
tell you something. I need to talk to Mom.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.060
Okay. You told me.

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:24.564
I'll try again later.

01:06:29.971 --> 01:06:32.462
Why in heaven's name did you
think I was the inside man?

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:38.172
Well, if you hadn't acted so strange,
I wouldn't have thought you were... so strange.

01:06:39.681 --> 01:06:42.206
And where were you the first time
these guys broke in?

01:06:42.283 --> 01:06:46.084
Why didn't you answer the intercom?
Why did you shut off the cameras?

01:06:46.154 --> 01:06:49.021
I didn't. But if those thugs
were using Molly's remote...

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.354
they could've turned off
the whole security system.

01:06:51.426 --> 01:06:55.522
- But why'd you say I was lying?
- Well, because I thought you were.

01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:58.999
And besides, I didn't want
Miss Natalie to know that I'd been...

01:06:59.068 --> 01:07:01.332
well, napping on the job.

01:07:01.404 --> 01:07:04.737
That woman. If she could work me
24 hours a day, she would.

01:07:04.807 --> 01:07:08.971
It's downright inhuman.
So, whenever she's not here, I, uh--

01:07:09.044 --> 01:07:12.309
- You take advantage.
- I take a break.

01:07:12.381 --> 01:07:14.906
A nice, well-deserved break.

01:07:14.984 --> 01:07:17.954
With all the cameras and intercoms
turned off, I didn't notice anything.

01:07:18.021 --> 01:07:21.320
- So I --
- You were covering your whoo-hoo!

01:07:21.391 --> 01:07:23.825
Precisely.

01:07:25.428 --> 01:07:28.556
- You want to try calling your mom again?
- Sure.

01:07:31.567 --> 01:07:33.364
- Hello?
- Mom?

01:07:33.436 --> 01:07:35.596
Kevin!

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:39.664
- Wait. Kevin, I can't hear you.
- That's probably 'cause
I'm locked in a wine cellar.

01:07:39.742 --> 01:07:42.506
No, I-- Honey, I can't hear you.
There's too much static.

01:07:42.578 --> 01:07:44.978
I'm locked in Natalie's wine cellar!

01:07:45.047 --> 01:07:47.447
- Are you calling to say Merry Christmas?
- Mom, are you there?

01:07:47.516 --> 01:07:49.416
- Sweetheart?
- Are you there, Mom?
- Kevin?

01:07:49.485 --> 01:07:51.680
Mom? Mom?

01:07:53.756 --> 01:07:56.385
Oh, great!

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.826
The battery's dead.

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:03.766
Hmm.

01:08:11.942 --> 01:08:14.171
Kalban residence.

01:08:14.243 --> 01:08:17.736
Hi, this is Kate McCallister, Kevin's mom.
May I speak to him, please?

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:23.149
- Kevin's not here right now.
- That's strange. He just called.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:28.715
Really? Well, he's out with
his father and Miss Natalie.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:32.921
Oh. Oh, he must have called from his Dad's
cell phone. That explains the line going dead.

01:08:32.996 --> 01:08:34.987
Okay. Thank you.

01:08:44.941 --> 01:08:47.809
Little rascal
called his mother.

01:08:47.879 --> 01:08:51.109
- You want me to go show him who's boss?
- Sit down, Marv.

01:08:51.182 --> 01:08:53.616
You're not the boss.
I'm the boss.

01:08:53.684 --> 01:08:56.346
Okay.

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:03.417
His cell phone is dead.
I don't think he'll be anymore trouble.

01:09:11.836 --> 01:09:13.770
No.

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:17.000
Cookie.

01:09:17.075 --> 01:09:19.134
Oh!

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:23.305
Hello?

01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:25.406
Peter, it's me. I 'm calling Kevin back.
We got disconnected.

01:09:25.484 --> 01:09:28.282
Kevin? Kevin's not with me.
He's back at Natalie's house.

01:09:28.353 --> 01:09:31.322
Really? I was just told
he's with you.

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:34.881
Well-- Well, don't worry, Kate.
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:38.697
Okay.

01:09:38.765 --> 01:09:41.460
Wow, that's weird.

01:09:41.533 --> 01:09:45.298
- Someone told Kate that Kevin's with us.
- Hmm.

01:09:45.368 --> 01:09:48.066
- Maybe I better go back and check on him.
- No.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.769
That's exactly what he wants.
Peter, he's manipulating you.

01:09:51.843 --> 01:09:54.970
Can't you see the pattern? Every time
we leave the house, he pulls something.

01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:59.211
He's just trying to get your
attention and sabotage me.

01:10:02.254 --> 01:10:06.350
Hello!
Anybody out there? Hello!

01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:16.300
There's gotta be something that
we can do to get outta here.

01:10:20.473 --> 01:10:23.601
There is.

01:10:23.676 --> 01:10:27.076
- Help me move these boxes.
- Okay.

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:29.137
But what's back there?

01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:32.082
Definitely not
a "dumb" question.

01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.381
- The dumbwaiter!
- Bingo.

01:10:34.454 --> 01:10:38.152
- Let's hope it still works. -
I'm sorry I misjudged you, Mr. Prescott.

01:10:40.295 --> 01:10:42.057
Likewise.

01:10:43.962 --> 01:10:46.397
I'll never forget
Miss Natalie's reaction...

01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:48.957
when she came home and saw
what you’d done to the house.

01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:55.466
I do love watching her hyperventilate!

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:58.534
It's one of the few pleasures
of this job.

01:10:58.612 --> 01:11:00.807
If you hate this job,
why don’t you quit?

01:11:00.881 --> 01:11:03.678
Jobs aren't that easy
to come by.

01:11:03.749 --> 01:11:06.379
Besides, I could end up
working for someone far worse.

01:11:06.453 --> 01:11:12.119
You shouldn't stay someplace you hate
just 'cause you’re scared. Life's too short.

01:11:13.594 --> 01:11:15.529
Hmm.

01:11:16.798 --> 01:11:18.857
And viola¤.

01:11:19.768 --> 01:11:21.702
Let's see if you fit.

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.702
Mm, up.

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:28.072
- Watch your head.
- As soon as I get up, I'm gonna let you out.

01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:32.512
You just take care of yourself, you hear?

01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.656
I'm tellin'ya, I heard something.

01:11:44.991 --> 01:11:48.758
All right.
Stay very alert here, Vera.

01:11:48.829 --> 01:11:51.593
I tell you what. Why don't you go down,
check out the wine cellar?

01:11:51.665 --> 01:11:53.791
- Okay.
- Yeah. There you go.

01:11:56.304 --> 01:11:58.295
Down here!

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.735
You better stay-- Oww!

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.304
Vera! Ow! Aah! Vera!

01:12:07.382 --> 01:12:09.543
- What? Ooh!
- Hit the button!

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:12.450
- Hang on, baby! Huuh!
- Oh! No, no! Hit the button!

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.752
- What? I can't hear you.
- Hit the button!

01:12:15.825 --> 01:12:18.293
- Oh!
- Oww!

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.420
No, no! Not that one!
The other button!

01:12:21.497 --> 01:12:24.293
That's it! Oww!

01:12:26.067 --> 01:12:28.001
Hey!

01:12:29.204 --> 01:12:31.195
Man!

01:12:31.272 --> 01:12:33.739
Over here!

01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:44.545
Hi, Mommy.

01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:03.197
Yes!

01:13:03.272 --> 01:13:06.106
See ya. Door, open!

01:13:15.585 --> 01:13:19.783
Natalie, you go get the royals.
I'm gonna go back and check on Kevin.

01:13:19.856 --> 01:13:23.222
- What, now?
- Yeah, somethin's up. I can sense it.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:28.094
- Maybe you have to be a parent.
- That's not fair. You know
how much I care about kids.

01:13:28.165 --> 01:13:30.998
How much do you care
about my kid?

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:35.668
Taxi!

01:13:38.075 --> 01:13:40.669
Kevin? Are you all right?

01:14:03.566 --> 01:14:07.059
Mom, do you think you could slow down
a little bit? Kevin's probably fine.

01:14:07.137 --> 01:14:09.298
You just keep an eye out
for cops, okay?

01:14:09.372 --> 01:14:13.933
All right, Vera. Go check out the living room.
See if he’s in there, all right?

01:14:14.009 --> 01:14:16.172
God! I can't believe this.

01:14:16.247 --> 01:14:20.513
I shoulda gone to college. Two years,
coulda been a dental technician. Two years!

01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:23.075
Marv! He's in the bedroom!

01:14:23.153 --> 01:14:25.918
- Mom?
- Get him!

01:14:28.826 --> 01:14:30.760
Door, open.

01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:43.039
Got ya.

01:14:52.918 --> 01:14:55.819
Uuh! Gaah!

01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:59.255
Aah!

01:14:59.324 --> 01:15:01.484
Ooh!

01:15:01.559 --> 01:15:03.719
Door, close.

01:15:08.467 --> 01:15:10.662
- Hey, Molly!
- Get in there!

01:15:14.941 --> 01:15:18.604
Marv, honey. You in there?

01:15:18.678 --> 01:15:22.306
- Shut up, Vera!
- Well, okay. I was just tryin' to--

01:15:22.381 --> 01:15:26.216
- Shut up, you moron.
- Hey, I'm no moron, you jerk.

01:15:26.286 --> 01:15:29.221
- Shut up, ya bag!
- Door, open!

01:15:35.095 --> 01:15:37.188
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

01:15:37.264 --> 01:15:39.825
I ain't no bag. And you know what?
You ain't no genius!

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:42.026
- Vera, honey--
- No! Don't "Vera, honey" me!

01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:44.831
- Honey--
- You're not even as smart as this kid, who,
in case you hadn't noticed...

01:15:44.904 --> 01:15:46.531
is totally kickin' our butts!

01:15:46.605 --> 01:15:49.473
Well, from now on,
I am my own boss!

01:15:49.543 --> 01:15:52.636
- Vera. Vera, honey--
- Don't "honey" me!

01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:55.203
Pumpkin. Pumpkin.

01:15:55.281 --> 01:15:59.685
Marv! Forget about her! Get the kid!
I'll be outta here in a few minutes.

01:16:10.263 --> 01:16:12.959
Oh!

01:16:15.336 --> 01:16:17.861
Whoa!

01:16:31.618 --> 01:16:34.553
Hey! Hey!

01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:36.782
Open sesame.

01:16:36.857 --> 01:16:40.223
- Well, get a load of that.
- Holy ma jolie!

01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:47.290
Come on, Vera!
All right! Come on out, kid!

01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:49.633
Ah! All right.

01:16:49.704 --> 01:16:52.672
Open bar. Open bookshelf.

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.642
Open-- Open book-bar.
Open book-bar-shelf.

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.111
- Open-- Open book-bar-thing.
- Open sesame.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.204
That's stupid.
Whoa!

01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:04.114
- Who's stupid now, stupid?
- Hey, come on. Just get off me, all right?

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.551
I'm gonna take care of everything.

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.612
Bar, revolve sesame.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.954
Watch this. It's all gonna be fine.

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.493
- Bar, stop.
- Oh! It's goin' faster!

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.895
Yeah, I know, Vera.
I know it's goin ‘faster.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:20.526
- Speed faster sesame.
- Okay. The wife's not feelin'--

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.139
Faster sesame!

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:32.144
Maximum speed sesame.

01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:42.046
Stop sesame.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:01.409
Nice jump, Marv.

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:14.921
Ohh!

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.690
Oof!.

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:36.801
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.314
Good night. Aah!

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.152
- Mr. Prescott!
- At your service.

01:18:45.222 --> 01:18:48.020
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:51.788
- Perhaps we should call the police.
- Good idea, Mr. Prescott.

01:18:51.862 --> 01:18:54.696
Just "Prescott" to you.

01:18:57.001 --> 01:18:58.991
"Prescott"!

01:19:08.512 --> 01:19:11.276
- I thought you said you weren't worried.
- I don't know.

01:19:11.348 --> 01:19:14.546
I just had a feeling.

01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:17.417
Kevin!

01:19:17.488 --> 01:19:20.047
Dad!

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.819
- Mom!
- Mom?

01:19:22.893 --> 01:19:25.328
- Who are they?
- Uh-oh!

01:19:25.396 --> 01:19:27.591
- Let's get outta here!
- Around the back!

01:19:27.665 --> 01:19:29.963
- We're on it. Let's go!
- Kevin!

01:19:39.977 --> 01:19:41.911
Ooh-ooh!

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.915
Yes!

01:19:46.652 --> 01:19:48.847
- Uuh!
- Yeah! Way to go, guys!

01:19:48.921 --> 01:19:50.855
Kevin!

01:19:52.524 --> 01:19:55.823
- Kevin!
- Mom!

01:19:55.894 --> 01:19:58.259
- Oh, honey! I'm so glad you're all right.
- Ohh!

01:19:58.329 --> 01:20:01.059
- I am now!
- I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

01:20:01.132 --> 01:20:03.861
Mmm!

01:20:03.935 --> 01:20:06.403
The police
have been summoned.

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.836
I've got lots of fun
planned for your stay.

01:20:08.907 --> 01:20:12.898
Can we go to Wrigley Field?
And the aquarium? Do you have any kids?

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:18.347
No. But I promise we'll have
a very exciting time.

01:20:18.416 --> 01:20:21.317
Cool!

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:29.753
- Oh, come on. No, prison's not so bad.
- Oh, yeah?

01:20:29.828 --> 01:20:32.819
- Yeah. On Thursdays you get Salisbury steak.
- Yeah, I know about prison.

01:20:32.897 --> 01:20:34.924
- That's where I met you.
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:20:35.001 --> 01:20:36.992
- You calm down.
- Women, eh?

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:39.334
- Yeah.
- Hey, don't touch me.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.641
- Peter! What's he done now?
- Well, he saved the day, that's what.

01:20:46.712 --> 01:20:49.840
You should be thanking him.

01:20:49.915 --> 01:20:53.077
Molly? What in the world
is going on?

01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:57.111
It seems they were gonna kidnap the prince.
Best we can gather, she's the boss.

01:20:57.189 --> 01:21:00.386
She's my maid.
I'm her boss!

01:21:00.459 --> 01:21:02.926
Well, looks like you're
gonna have to find a new maid.

01:21:02.994 --> 01:21:06.659
And a new butler,
I'm afraid.

01:21:07.567 --> 01:21:10.161
- I resign.
- Resign?

01:21:10.236 --> 01:21:12.170
But... why?

01:21:12.238 --> 01:21:17.005
Because as a wise young man
once said, "Life's too short."

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.607
Peter, do something.

01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:27.576
All right. Here goes.

01:21:27.655 --> 01:21:32.456
Natalie,
I think I mistook...

01:21:32.526 --> 01:21:35.654
infatuation and excitement
for love.

01:21:35.729 --> 01:21:39.824
Look, this--
this is your world. It's not mine.

01:21:39.899 --> 01:21:43.129
The whole time I was here,
all I did was miss my family.

01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:45.433
I'm in love
with my wife and kids...

01:21:45.506 --> 01:21:48.441
and I belong with them.

01:21:48.509 --> 01:21:52.842
And I wanna come home. I mean, I
understand if you need time to think about it.

01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:56.809
Mom?

01:22:00.454 --> 01:22:02.388
Oh!

01:22:02.456 --> 01:22:04.425
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:22:06.127 --> 01:22:10.085
Young man, how are we ever
going to show you our gratitude?

01:22:10.164 --> 01:22:13.189
Would your family like to spend
Christmas with our family?

01:22:13.266 --> 01:22:15.668
That sounds cool.

01:22:15.737 --> 01:22:17.795
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

01:22:17.871 --> 01:22:20.431
You're going to be with them?

01:22:20.507 --> 01:22:24.102
Today? On Christmas?

01:22:31.552 --> 01:22:34.181
Thank you.

01:22:35.724 --> 01:22:38.887
Music, on.

01:22:40.527 --> 01:22:43.290
Snow, fall.

01:22:43.363 --> 01:22:45.925
Ha ha! Hey!

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.629
I knew this was gonna be
the best Christmas ever!
