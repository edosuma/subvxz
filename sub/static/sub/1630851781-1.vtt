you would too.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.801
That's okay, Doodle.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.585
It could've been worse.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.631
It could've been...

10:31.761 --> 10:33.241
two pies.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.330

Pal pie?

10:55.524 --> 10:58.527
We've been down this block
three times already.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.095
We're never
going to find him.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.357
Never say never.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.098
This is Doodle
we're talking about.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.491
We're not giving up.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.974

Hi, Cindy!
Huh?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.068
Has Doodle been here?

[laughing]

11:19.766 --> 11:21.028
How did you guess?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.160
He just ran off
that way.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.684
I think.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.860
Or it may have been
that way.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.644
I couldn't see that well.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.907
I had some pie
on my face at the time.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.431

we're getting closer.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.835
Oh, Doodle has to be
around here somewhere.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.577

you had something

14:10.066 --> 14:11.372
for your special friend,

14:11.502 --> 14:13.591
and then I saw you
give presents to Rox and Blair,

I wasn't your

Oh, Doodle.

I'm sure
he didn't mean it.

Whatever he did,
I promise we'll make it right.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.062
Please, Scratch?

14:49.192 --> 14:50.977
You don't wanna
keep friends apart

14:51.107 --> 14:53.805
on Friendship Day,
do you?

14:53.936 --> 14:56.852

14:56.983 --> 14:59.594
Oh, it's the best day ever!

It's when you show your friends
how much they mean to you.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.339
That's fine
if you have friends,

15:05.469 --> 15:08.995
but nobody likes
a dog-catcher.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.997
That can't be true,
Scratch.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.476
Somebody must like you--

an exception just this once.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.763
The Dog-Catcher's
List of Rules.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.635
And Rule #752 says...

15:40.765 --> 15:41.853
when releasing a dog,

15:41.984 --> 15:43.203
be certain to return it

15:43.333 --> 15:45.727
to its rightful owner.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.861
How can I be sure
this dog is yours?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.429
Because you know us,
Scratch.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.084
Sunny's cut your hair
a hundred times.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.000
No, wait... 94.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.090
And you've chased Doodle
at least that many times.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.831
That doesn't prove anything.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.312
If it's proof you want,
it's proof you'll get.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.185

16:09.316 --> 16:10.839
Team huddle, okay.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.581
How do we prove to Scratch
that Doodle's my dog?

Oh, I could go get the scrapbook
of all your pictures together.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.412
Or the cards
you've made each other.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.109

back at the salon.

It's okay that
you didn't get me

20:05.334 --> 20:06.727
anything for
Friendship Day.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.859
'Cause now I know
it's all about

20:08.990 --> 20:10.948
how much we mean
to each other...

20:11.079 --> 20:13.212
and all the little things
we do for each other.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.605
But I do have
something for you.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.128
[gasps]You do?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.304
It's back at the salon.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.914
You should know, Doodle,

20:20.044 --> 20:22.003
you're my BDFF.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.918
Best dog friend forever.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.789
I am? Oh!

20:25.920 --> 20:28.444
What about your YRMIPPBDFF?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.359
What's that stand for?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.187
You Really Mean It,
Pinky-Promise,

20:32.318 --> 20:33.971
Best Dog Friend Forever?

20:34.102 --> 20:38.106
Yep, YRMIPP...

20:38.237 --> 20:39.847
eh, that too.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.327
[barking]

20:41.457 --> 20:42.719
Oh, guess
what I found out?

20:42.850 --> 20:46.070
Not everyone likes
getting their face licked!

20:46.201 --> 20:48.725
Seriously?
Can't believe it.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.510
[chuckling]
Now let's get back

20:50.640 --> 20:52.468
to the salon so I can
give you your present.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.730
[laughing]

20:53.861 --> 20:56.429
And I can give you
your present too!

20:59.649 --> 21:01.477
A new collar!

21:01.608 --> 21:02.957
Oh, I love it!

21:03.087 --> 21:04.524
Especially the hearts.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.003
I'll keep it
for special occasions

21:06.134 --> 21:07.396
like Friendship Day.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.311
Oh, now open yours!

21:09.442 --> 21:12.445
I drew it,
and I made the frame too!

21:12.575 --> 21:13.533
Out of dog biscuits!

21:13.663 --> 21:16.187
I love it--
and, you know,

21:16.318 --> 21:18.538
these hearts
give me an idea.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.596
Ta-da!
Heart braids!
We match!

21:33.727 --> 21:37.121
And now everybody can see
how much we mean to each other.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.732
Hold still!

21:38.862 --> 21:41.169
Definitely one
for the Style Files!

21:42.475 --> 21:45.216
Hi, it's me, Sunny,
