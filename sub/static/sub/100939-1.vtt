women's march

11:56.803 --> 11:58.587
after the inauguration?

11:58.630 --> 12:02.156
After Hillary's inauguration?
I mean, women were excited,

12:02.199 --> 12:03.679
and there were parades.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.160
But no march?
No pussy hats?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.119
[chuckles]
What are pussy hats?

12:09.163 --> 12:13.123
It's not important.Was there a #MeToo?

12:13.167 --> 12:15.169
U-2? What-what, the band?

12:15.212 --> 12:17.606
No. A #MeToo movement.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.782
I'm not sure what that is.

12:22.089 --> 12:26.354
So Harvey Weinstein isstill a thing in your world?

12:26.397 --> 12:28.225
In-in theworld?

12:28.269 --> 12:30.314
Well, he won the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.143
So, I guess...Oh, my God.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.363
[voice breaking]:And now I represent him.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.060
Yeah.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.453
Oh...

12:38.496 --> 12:40.803
Congratulations.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.551
"Film Career. Activism.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.684
"Friendship with the President.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.295
"Controversies.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.601
"Weinstein has been criticized

12:56.645 --> 12:59.822
"for reediting many of his
arthouse purchases,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.955
with some directors
referring to him as

13:01.998 --> 13:04.827
'Harvey Scissorhands.'"

13:07.525 --> 13:09.919
Well?

13:09.963 --> 13:14.010
No one has accused Weinstein
of rape yet?

13:14.054 --> 13:15.490
No.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.405
Or-or of masturbating
into plants?

13:17.448 --> 13:19.320
What?! No. Ew.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.496
Why-why was he masturbating
into plants?

13:21.539 --> 13:23.672
I-I don't remember.
A few of them were.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.892
What was going on
in your world?

13:25.935 --> 13:28.633
So, no one has
come forward yet, right?

13:28.677 --> 13:29.852
Here in...

13:29.896 --> 13:32.855
Reality? No.
Not that I know of.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.857
Who else was masturbating
into plants?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.338
I don't remember, there were
so many men with issues.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.861
Like who?Charlie Rose.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.341
That guy with the round table?

13:40.384 --> 13:41.995
What did he do?
Isn't he, like, 90?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.779
No, he liked
walking around naked

13:43.823 --> 13:45.346
in front of his
female assistants.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.609
Oh! Who else?

13:47.652 --> 13:48.653
Matt Lauer.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.569
Okay, who is that?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.875
MARISSA:
Team Weinstein.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.399
Look, maybe it's only
in your dream that

13:55.443 --> 13:57.488
Weinstein is raping people

13:57.532 --> 13:59.403
and masturbating into plants.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.665
Maybe in reality he's just,
you know,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.537
some asshole producer

14:02.580 --> 14:05.061
who screams at people
and cheats on contracts.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.628
Maybe.

14:06.671 --> 14:10.110
Harvey would like youto make this your top priority.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.720
He believes that
the project's success

14:11.763 --> 14:12.939
had a lot to do with him.

14:12.982 --> 14:13.983
ADRIAN:
Mm.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.727
ADRIAN:Diane?

14:18.770 --> 14:20.685
I'm sorry,what project is this?

14:20.729 --> 14:22.600
Snowpiercer.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.733
The TV adaptation.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.475
All of the information you needis right there.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.390
Mr. Weinstein has nolegal claim to this project?

14:29.433 --> 14:32.654
Well, as we said,
Harvey believes his input

14:32.697 --> 14:35.004
was essential to
its success in features,

14:35.048 --> 14:36.745
so he wants us to pursue
any legal remedy.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.573
And what legal remedy...

14:38.616 --> 14:41.881
We will definitely
look into that.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.840
All legal options
will be explored.ROISIN: Good.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.581
Harvey would love news
on the suit,

14:46.624 --> 14:49.410
even just the filing, to reportduring our publicity push.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.412
And when is that?Next week.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.935
He'll be interviewed
by Charlie Rose.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.110
[laughs out loud]

14:55.459 --> 14:57.766
Sorry.Then Friday,

14:57.809 --> 14:59.159
he'll be on the Today Show
with Matt Lauer.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.900
[laughs]

15:00.943 --> 15:03.467
We are on it.
Anything else?

15:03.511 --> 15:04.860
We want you to look at
the NDAs.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.949
We have several
former employees

15:06.993 --> 15:09.169
that we believe might
be in breach.

15:10.735 --> 15:11.867
Believe?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.870
How do you believe that?

15:16.611 --> 15:17.917
Harvey has his ways.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.658
Anyway, those are
the most outstanding items.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.965
And if I may,
I'd like to ask

15:23.009 --> 15:24.532
just the core
team to remain.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.621
I have just one more item
I'd like to discuss.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.622
ADRIAN:
Certainly.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.581
Uh, Tim, James, Mike.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.063
Harvey is worried that

15:34.107 --> 15:36.805
the Republicans are
going to come after him

15:36.848 --> 15:38.546
for supporting Hillary.ADRIAN: In what way

15:38.589 --> 15:40.113
coming after him?

15:40.156 --> 15:41.897
With false accusations
of sexual assaults.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.855
We've had three charges already,

15:43.899 --> 15:45.553
and we believe more
are on the way.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.120
We have a pretrial hearing
in two hours

15:47.163 --> 15:48.773
to turn over discovery.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.167
Of what?
What discovery?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.213
Contracts,
Harvey's travel information.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.824
Photos of his anatomy.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.000
Oh, my God.Yes, exactly.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.045
It's harassment.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.655
These woman are after Harvey.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.962
And why do you think
they're "after" him?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.530
Because Harvey's an easy target.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.055
But these women are Democrats.
Right?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.014
Diane is worried that

16:12.058 --> 16:15.017
this will be the plaintiff's
argument in court.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.671
Right, Diane?

16:16.714 --> 16:17.802
ROISIN:
They lie because

16:17.846 --> 16:20.022
actresses have
a limited shelf life,

16:20.066 --> 16:22.982
and they feel Harvey hasn't
advanced their careers.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.766
We have investigators

16:24.809 --> 16:28.030
that have all of the background
you need on these women.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
Yes, what is that?
Black Cube?

16:30.119 --> 16:32.992
How do you know about
Black Cube?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.254
I do my research.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
What is Black Cube?Israeli investigators.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.214
They're brought on board

16:38.258 --> 16:40.216
to make the women look bad.Look,

16:40.260 --> 16:43.872
we came to you because
you're the best.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.787
And because Harvey wanted
a woman

16:45.830 --> 16:47.789
and an African-American man
defending him.

16:47.832 --> 16:51.923
So, are you up for it,
or should we move on?

16:51.967 --> 16:54.622
We are definitely up for it.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.060
ADRIAN:
Diane, what is going on
with you?!

16:58.104 --> 17:00.193
Now, you've told me yourself
you liked his movies.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.805
He's a serial rapist, Adrian.
A sexual predator.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.067
And how do you know that?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.808
Because I--

17:06.851 --> 17:09.550
Because of these women
coming forward.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.900
These women are coming forward
for attention,

17:11.943 --> 17:13.554
because he's a screamer.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.209
You know you're saying he's
guilty until proven innocent.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.646
No, I am looking
at the evidence.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.692
There is no evidence, Diane.
Wh-What evidence?

17:21.736 --> 17:22.780
The Ronan Farrow revelations.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.086
You're talking aboutthat story

17:24.130 --> 17:26.088
that NBC refused to broadcast

17:26.132 --> 17:27.959
because it was so shoddy?

17:28.003 --> 17:29.222
They're only saying that
because they are

17:29.265 --> 17:30.875
covering up for Matt Lauer.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.922
[laughing]:
Matt Lauer? My God!

17:33.965 --> 17:37.230
Jesus Christ, Diane!
You're dealing in rumors.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.884
Not facts.If we had done
the same thing with Reddick,

17:39.928 --> 17:41.060
we'd be a lot better off now.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.931
What?

17:45.238 --> 17:47.762
What about Carl?Nothing.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.938
Diane, what have you heard
about Carl?

17:49.981 --> 17:53.159
Nothing.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.160
Yet.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.118
What do you mean "yet"?

17:56.162 --> 17:58.120
Harvey Weinstein will
blow up in our face.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.688
We need to drop him.Maybe you haven't been

18:00.731 --> 18:03.865
paying attention, Diane.

18:03.908 --> 18:08.130
We need Weinstein
more than he needs us.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.871
We're not doing well.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.177
What do you mean?

18:11.220 --> 18:14.702
The Hillary tax.

18:14.745 --> 18:15.703
The what?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.096
The rise in corporate taxes.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.620
It's not just hitting
our bottom line,

18:19.663 --> 18:21.665
it's hitting our clients.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.928
Why do you think we're
getting into entertainment?

18:23.972 --> 18:27.845
We need to keep
Weinstein happy.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.196
Or we need to have
a conversation

18:30.239 --> 18:33.851
about dissolving and bankruptcy.

18:38.769 --> 18:41.163
What about my dad?What?

18:41.207 --> 18:43.078
I heard you say that
there was a rumor

18:43.122 --> 18:45.994
about my dad; what rumor?

18:46.037 --> 18:48.039
Nothing.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.003
These women only
want justice.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.701
Your Honor, they deserve
to see this evidence.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.877
The defense attorney
keeps arguing

18:59.921 --> 19:01.662
that this is harassment,

19:01.705 --> 19:03.925
and Mr. Weinstein'sa very busy man.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.754
Well, we're not asking
that Mr. Weinstein gather

19:06.797 --> 19:08.190
this information himself.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.323
He has a lot of lawyers.Let them do it for him.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.672
JUDGE:You made your point, Counselor.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.064
Defense?

19:20.115 --> 19:24.293
Your Honor, the plaintiff is notjust asking for schedules.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.121
They're asking for photos
of our client's

19:26.165 --> 19:27.775
most sensitive anatomy.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.256
And the reason why is they wantto force us into a settlement.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.257
This is about money.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.867
No, it isn't.Yes, it is.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.042
You're not
righting a wrong.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.348
This is about a few
bitter actresses

19:35.391 --> 19:36.958
who didn't get the part...Bitter actresses?

19:37.001 --> 19:38.916
...going after a man...No, I don't think so.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.876
And don't defame my clients.Do not!MATA: Okay, okay, stop!

19:41.919 --> 19:43.704
I get it. I'm ready to rule.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.053
[clears throat]

19:45.096 --> 19:48.230
Your discovery request,Ms. Ann Howard, is denied.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.711
I'm not seeing any evidence
of real harassment.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.060
HOWARD: Your Honor...MATA: No.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.322
This is a simple case

19:53.366 --> 19:55.237
of "he said, she said."
In fact, it's worse.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.326
The case rests onan old cliché,

19:57.370 --> 19:58.980
the Hollywood casting couch.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.460
Well, that may havebeen true

20:00.503 --> 20:02.244
in the old studio system,

20:02.288 --> 20:05.247
but with major Wall Street
companies like this,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.989
no one would risk
that kind of exposure.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.817
I rule for the defense.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.384
And I would suggest,Ms. Ann Howard,

20:11.427 --> 20:13.908
you talk to your clients.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.344
[gavel bangs]

20:16.954 --> 20:20.393
His Honor would like
to speak to you for a second?

20:24.005 --> 20:26.137
I, uh, want to be clear:

20:26.181 --> 20:28.096
this has nothing
to do with my ruling.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.054
This is not ex parte.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.926
Do we understand?

20:31.969 --> 20:34.145
Yes, Your Honor.Good.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.931
My daughter is looking
for an internship this summer,

20:36.974 --> 20:39.107
and she would love
to find a spot

20:39.150 --> 20:41.979
in a large production company
like Mr. Weinstein's.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.286
Could you put ina good word for her?

20:44.330 --> 20:45.809
Certainly, Your Honor.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.420
Good, good.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.510
She would really love to beunder Mr. Weinstein this summer.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.948
Mm.

20:53.991 --> 20:57.212
I'll speak to Weinstein's
people about the internship.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.866
What? You want to?

20:58.909 --> 21:00.868
No, I'm just
thinking,

21:00.911 --> 21:02.304
justice is
an equation.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.132
What kind of equation?

21:04.175 --> 21:06.961
Justice equals the law
times the zeitgeist.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.964
The law on its own
doesn't stand up.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.314
You need the mood of
the times on your side.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.142
Diane, we just won.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.013
The zeitgeist workedfor us.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.406
But against women.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.973
The president's a woman.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.322
How is it against women?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.193
In my dream, women
got together

21:22.237 --> 21:24.195
and held a march
and said "no more."

21:24.239 --> 21:25.806
Yeah, well,that's the thing with dreams.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.460
You can make themanything you want.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.810
My guess would bethat only the women partners

21:29.853 --> 21:31.333
got to say "no more."

21:31.377 --> 21:33.509
We associates--we can't risk it.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.342
Harvey saves two or
three internship spots

21:40.386 --> 21:41.952
each summer
for his friends.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.998
Malia Obama did one
a few years ago.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.478
That's great.The judge will love that.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.262
Oh, um...
[clears throat]

21:47.306 --> 21:50.004
Can you do one more
favor for me, Lucca?

21:50.047 --> 21:52.006
Harvey asked that
a lawyer drop by

21:52.049 --> 21:54.225
with these court documents
to have them signed.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.924
He wants me?Yeah, just to drop
by his suite.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.492
Uh, he should drop by our officeand sign them.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.842
Unfortunately, Harvey's
waiting for a conference call

22:01.885 --> 22:03.844
in his hotel suite,
so he can't leave.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.106
Well, then, I'll take them.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.281
No, Harvey wants
Lucca to come.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.978
Why?

22:08.022 --> 22:12.287
Because Harvey reviews every
lawyer involved in his cases,

22:12.331 --> 22:13.897
and he's intrigued by Lucca.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.377
Has he seen her photo?

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
Diane.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.033
What are you saying?

22:19.076 --> 22:20.339
I'm saying
you're Harvey's pimp.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.166
Are you fucking serious?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.907
LUCCA:
Could you, uh,
give us a second?

22:26.606 --> 22:28.608
This is exactly what
I'm talking about, Diane.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.871
I need face time
with our top clients,

22:30.914 --> 22:33.090
and you keep finding
ways to stop it.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.440
I'm going with these papers.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.267
The client wants it,
and I want it.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.879
Lucca, listen to me. Listento me. This is how it will go.

22:38.922 --> 22:42.186
You will bring those courtpapers to the hotel concierge.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.885
An he will call up,and Weinstein will apologize

22:44.928 --> 22:48.628
and say he can't come down,could you bring them up to him?

22:48.671 --> 22:50.107
So you'll ask the concierge

22:50.151 --> 22:51.892
to bring them upto get them signed.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.328
But Weinstein will say

22:53.372 --> 22:55.896
he only has a few questionsfor you,

22:55.939 --> 22:57.898
it'll only take a minute.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.466
So you will go up,and he'll answer the door,

23:00.509 --> 23:02.206
and he'll be wearing a robe.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.512
[scoffs]And then he will

23:03.556 --> 23:06.080
ask you to help him withsomething in the bathroom.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.429
He will be naked.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.605
Come on, Diane.He will be naked.

23:09.649 --> 23:13.914
And he'll ask you to massagehis shoulders and his back.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.524
Or he'll ask youto watch him take a shower.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.570
Diane, stop. Stop it!

23:18.962 --> 23:20.399
Look at me.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.444
Trust me.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.403
I can take care of myself.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.666
I am going.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.149
[clears throat]

23:32.193 --> 23:34.064
[phone ringing]Hello?

23:34.108 --> 23:37.590
DIANE:
Marissa, listen, I need
to ask you a favor.

23:37.633 --> 23:41.289
Lucca is on her way
to Harvey Weinstein's hotel.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.465
I need you
to keep a close eye on her.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.598
Is Weinstein going
to masturbate into plants?

23:52.518 --> 23:54.650
[gentle piano music playing]

23:58.524 --> 24:00.090
Yes?

24:00.134 --> 24:02.310
Um, I have some papersfor Mr. Weinstein

24:02.353 --> 24:04.225
to sign.Of course.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.531
Uh, one second.
I'll call him.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.010
Thanks.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.403
Come on,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.187
Marissa. I can see you.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.060
Oh, Lucca, hi.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.975
What are you doing here?

24:15.018 --> 24:16.411
Diane sent you?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.153
No. What do you mean?

24:19.196 --> 24:21.155
Okay, yes, but
it's not just her.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.070
I'm concerned, too.I'm fine, Marissa.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.072
Just go home.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.509
Uh, Mr. Weinstein wants youto come up to his suite.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.859
540, the penthouse.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.342
Uh, actually, our bosswants us to stay down here.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.476
Can you have a messenger bringthis up to him to be signed?

24:37.519 --> 24:39.303
And we will wait in the bar.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.349
One second.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.354
Do you think
Diane is a witch?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.399
No, I just thinkshe knows how men work.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.535
Mr. Weinstein just has
a few questions.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.929
He only needs you to
go up for a minute.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.627
The penthouse,
suite 540.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.501
[elevator bell dings]

25:07.984 --> 25:11.379
Okay, so if Diane is right,on the other side of that door

25:11.422 --> 25:13.512
is Harvey Weinsteinin a bathrobe.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.167
Stand over there.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.568
[door opens]

25:31.921 --> 25:33.488
[indistinct chatter]

25:33.532 --> 25:35.490
ZOE:
This isn't

25:35.534 --> 25:37.057
just the year of the women.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.580
It's the decade

25:38.624 --> 25:40.930
of the women.
It's our time.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.237
With the presidency,

25:43.280 --> 25:44.891
women can do
whatever they want.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.894
I'm thinking of sending my
business your way, Diane.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.157
We women have
to stick together.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.115
Oh, I'd like that, Ingrid.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.900
Thank you.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.423
INGRID:
I suggested Harvey bring
his business to you.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.468
Harvey Weinstein?

25:57.512 --> 26:02.299
Yes. Oh, he has done so much
for the women's cause.

26:02.343 --> 26:05.607
I'm having him speak at the nextWomen United for Change event.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.609
[camera shutters clicking]

26:07.653 --> 26:11.918
You don't think his way ofworking with women is suspect?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.920
Well, yes,

26:13.963 --> 26:15.922
I know he can be
a bit handsy.

26:15.965 --> 26:18.446
He's a bad boy,
like Jack Warner.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.927
But he is good on
women's causes.

26:20.970 --> 26:24.104
I mean, pro-choice
and Hillary.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.106
WOMAN:
Ms. Lockhart, you are one

26:26.149 --> 26:28.021
of the foundersof Women United for Change,

26:28.064 --> 26:30.937
an organization that evenour president has mentioned.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.941
What does Women United forChange mean in this day and age?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.943
It means we have
a long way to go.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.075
Really? A long way to what?

26:39.119 --> 26:41.034
Telling our stories.

26:41.077 --> 26:46.343
Uh, the secretary
forced to date her boss.

26:46.387 --> 26:50.434
A comedian forced to watch a
more powerful one masturbate.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.393
Those stories.
We all have them.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.090
Uh, okay, I, um...

26:54.134 --> 26:57.050
Tarana Burke is an
African-American activist

26:57.093 --> 27:00.531
who works to improve the
lives of young women at risk.

27:00.575 --> 27:05.014
She coined the phrase
"Me Too" in 2006.

27:05.058 --> 27:08.061
And it is time
to bring that back

27:08.104 --> 27:10.193
by sharing our
stories online

27:10.237 --> 27:13.457
and attaching her
hashtag "#MeToo."

27:13.501 --> 27:15.372
It shouldn't matter

27:15.416 --> 27:17.505
that Donald Trump
isn't our president.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.463
These abuses are
still going on.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.117
Okay, thank you.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.989
So, remember, the
hashtag "#MeToo."

27:23.032 --> 27:24.425
No one is alone.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.296
Just come forth and
share your stories.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.038
Thank you.Ingrid, hello.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.649
You don't have
a Twitter account?

27:30.692 --> 27:32.651
No, I never needed one.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.132
Okay. There it is.

27:36.176 --> 27:39.266
Now you want it
to link to Tarana Burke?

27:39.309 --> 27:41.572
Yes. Her "Me Too" site.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.400
Me...?Too.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.359
Well, that's kind of obscure.

27:45.402 --> 27:49.015
Want something more provocativelike "Men Who Hurt Women"?

27:49.058 --> 27:51.365
No, no, no. Just
a "Me Too" hashtag.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.714
Okay.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.369
There it goes.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.414
I'm not surethis will get much traction.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.199
You need to connectwith more influencers.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.418
Maybe this will do it.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.421
E NEWSCASTER:
...the yearly Women Unite
for Change Awards last night,

28:04.465 --> 28:07.207
in order to celebrate
the year's achievements.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.774
This isn't just the
year of the women.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.472
It's the decade
of the women.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.388
Women can do whatever they want.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.347
E NEWSCASTER:
Women Unite for Change
co-founder Diane Lockhart

28:17.391 --> 28:20.089
believes women are stronger
than ever.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.569
No one is alone.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.050
Come forward. Tell your story.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.487
E NEWSCASTER:
And tell them they did.
The splashy event

28:26.530 --> 28:29.403
raised two million dollars
for feminist causes.

28:29.446 --> 28:32.058
Megaproducer Harvey Weinstein
contributed

28:32.101 --> 28:34.582
a matching fund of two million.

28:34.625 --> 28:38.107
Was that supposed to send peopleto the You-too site?

28:39.369 --> 28:42.590
Did you callWeinstein's person a pimp?

28:42.633 --> 28:44.418
Yes, I did.LIZ:Why?

28:44.461 --> 28:45.767
Because she's a pimp.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.726
A pimp as in...?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.815
She procures sex for Weinstein.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.732
They want you to apologize.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.777
[laughs]
Seriously?Yes.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.085
They sent over that letterfor you to sign.

28:59.128 --> 29:02.088
"Dear Mr. Weinstein,

29:02.131 --> 29:05.091
"Please, I beg you
to not stop reading.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.788
"I have done a terrible thing.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.617
But what I did was beyond
being oblivious to humanity"?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.750
[laughs]

29:11.793 --> 29:13.447
ADRIAN:
They're serious.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.798
They're threateningto pull their business.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.280
Then let them.
Seriously, fuck them!

29:20.323 --> 29:22.282
Diane?

29:22.325 --> 29:25.285
I don't think you realizehow close we are to Chapter 11.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.852
And Weinstein will
make a difference?

29:26.895 --> 29:29.811
Yes. We're going to haveto start firing associates.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.205
I know you have heard rumorsabout Weinstein,

29:32.248 --> 29:34.207
but we've defended wife-killers.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.122
Lisa Bloom defendedWeinstein.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.776
I've heard you go onabout her.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.516
Why are youdrawing the line here?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.214
Then take me off the account.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.390
The Weinstein account?Yes. You're right.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.132
Everyone deserves a defense.

29:46.175 --> 29:49.831
Just not everyone
deserves mydefense.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.312
Oh, Zoe.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.314
I didn't know
we had a meeting.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
We don't.
I just wanted

29:55.881 --> 29:57.621
to drop by to discuss something.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.581
Okay?I asked Lucca
to be here, too.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.191
What's "Me Too"?

30:02.235 --> 30:05.281
It's a website of women
trading stories of abuse.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.848
This is

30:06.892 --> 30:09.372
what you were talking about
at Women Unite for Change?

30:09.416 --> 30:12.680
Yes.Several women approached
me asking about it.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.856
I had to admit
I didn't know about it.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.205
You started this?

30:16.249 --> 30:19.165
No. Tarana Burke did.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.820
But you're
popularizing it?Well, if I can.

30:21.863 --> 30:25.345
I mean, it's supposed to be
a grassroots women's movement.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.173
Okay. I need you
to remove it.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.783
What? Why?

30:28.827 --> 30:32.656
You're trying to suggest
women get angry about abuse,

30:32.700 --> 30:34.528
right?Yes.

30:34.571 --> 30:37.879
That's not the message
that helps us in 2020.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.229
Hillary only gets reelected

30:40.273 --> 30:43.363
if men don't feel women
are leading with their anger.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.799
But women are angry.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.931
No, they're not.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.455
Women are making advances now.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.196
And they're doing it

30:50.239 --> 30:53.590
through competence,
not through grievance.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.244
What about women
who are being abused?

30:55.288 --> 30:56.593
Who have been abused?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.900
They will find
support from Hillary.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.380
From this administration.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.208
So you're asking them
to just shut up?

31:02.251 --> 31:04.732
No, I'm asking them
to get a woman reelected

31:04.775 --> 31:07.213
to the highest
office in the land.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.693
If Hillary doesn't
win, Trump wins.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.913
Then what do we have?

31:11.957 --> 31:13.697
[speaking indistinctly]

31:13.741 --> 31:16.570
Diane?

31:16.613 --> 31:19.442
I just realized something.

31:19.486 --> 31:22.619
W-Where's my husband?

31:22.663 --> 31:24.578
What?I've spentthe last few days

31:24.621 --> 31:27.276
at work and I-I haven't
talked to him once.
