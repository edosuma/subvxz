WEBVTT

00:07.526 --> 00:09.359
We have a deal with The Butcher,

00:09.361 --> 00:11.528
<i> and she's gonna get you back.</i>

00:13.999 --> 00:15.064
There was no way out.

00:16.501 --> 00:18.701
SHELBY:
<i> Oh, my God. They're coming.</i>

00:18.703 --> 00:20.670
<i> What do we do?</i>

00:20.672 --> 00:23.206
Of all the horrors I'd seen...

00:23.208 --> 00:26.709
<i> this one affected me...</i>
<i> to the core.</i>

00:33.485 --> 00:35.818
MATT:<i> I gave up.</i>
<i> There was no way out.</i>

00:35.820 --> 00:38.755
<i> I just tried to soak up every</i>
<i> last second I had left.</i>

00:46.665 --> 00:48.898
There are very few homes
in the United States

00:48.900 --> 00:50.366
that have a history
as interesting

00:50.368 --> 00:52.502
as the big Shaker mansion
built in 1792

00:52.504 --> 00:54.837
by Edward Philippe Mott,

00:54.839 --> 00:56.506
at 900 Sappony Road.

00:56.508 --> 00:59.008
<i> As Daphne du Maurier</i>
<i> has famously written,</i>

00:59.010 --> 01:00.843
<i> "Who can either affirm or deny</i>

01:00.845 --> 01:03.346
<i>"that the houses that sheltered</i>
<i> us as children, adults,</i>

01:03.348 --> 01:04.714
<i> "and our predecessors, too,</i>

01:04.716 --> 01:06.382
<i> "have not embedded</i>
<i> in their walls</i>

01:06.384 --> 01:08.017
<i> "the imprint of what was then,</i>

01:08.019 --> 01:09.686
the suffering, the joy?"

01:09.688 --> 01:12.889
I cannot speak to the joy
at the house at Sappony,

01:12.891 --> 01:15.024
but there certainly was plenty
of suffering.

01:15.026 --> 01:16.859
Lot five:

01:16.861 --> 01:21.364
<i> Portrait of a Nobleman, </i>
1789,

01:21.366 --> 01:23.299
by John Alden Peale.

01:26.571 --> 01:27.937
AUCTIONEER:
Sir!

01:31.209 --> 01:34.611
Sir! We are in the middle
of taking bids.

01:34.613 --> 01:36.613
Well, stop.

01:37.882 --> 01:39.215
Everyone go home!

01:39.217 --> 01:41.117
I am buying the whole lot.

01:41.119 --> 01:43.953
I won't be outbid so you're
all wasting your time.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.055
(gavel bangs)

01:46.057 --> 01:47.724
Even amongst the rich
of the day,

01:47.726 --> 01:49.626
he was envied
for his great wealth.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.127
Family money, of course.

02:02.273 --> 02:05.074
DORIS:<i> Edward had what would</i>
<i> probably be diagnosed now</i>

02:05.076 --> 02:06.743
<i> as severe social anxiety.</i>

02:06.745 --> 02:09.145
<i> He hated being around people.</i>

02:09.147 --> 02:11.748
<i> So he went as far away</i>
<i> as he could from the parties</i>

02:11.750 --> 02:13.583
<i> and the excitement</i>
<i> of Philadelphia.</i>

02:13.585 --> 02:16.419
<i>He found a plot of land deep in</i>
<i> the North Carolina woods</i>

02:16.421 --> 02:19.455
<i> on Roanoke River's edge</i>
<i> and bought it from the state.</i>

02:19.457 --> 02:21.991
<i> Then he sent Shakers down</i>
<i> to build a retreat,</i>

02:21.993 --> 02:25.528
<i> an escape where he and his</i>
<i>beloved artwork could be alone.</i>

02:26.965 --> 02:28.698
Welcome home, sir.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.934
(sighs)
More paintings?

02:31.936 --> 02:35.438
The house is coming along.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.440
How goes the underground work?

02:37.442 --> 02:38.941
They dig day and night.

02:38.943 --> 02:40.977
It's slow work,
because of all the trees.

02:40.979 --> 02:43.312
Deep roots in these woods.

02:43.314 --> 02:45.848
It must be done.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.950
The artworks in this house
are worth more

02:47.952 --> 02:50.119
than every tobacco farm in
the state put together.

02:50.121 --> 02:52.121
If kidnappers come for them,

02:52.123 --> 02:54.190
we need to be able to
facilitate their escape.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.192
(crash)

02:56.194 --> 02:57.760
(man screams)

03:00.799 --> 03:03.900
(groans)

03:04.869 --> 03:06.936
(inhuman howling)

03:11.342 --> 03:12.675
There were numerous incidents

03:12.677 --> 03:14.043
during the building
of the house.

03:19.150 --> 03:20.183
Odd stories.

03:20.185 --> 03:21.718
(echoed shriek)

03:23.822 --> 03:25.221
Mischief, mostly.

03:31.196 --> 03:32.662
(taps)
(clears throat)

03:32.664 --> 03:34.063
Put these in the main parlor.

03:34.065 --> 03:36.799
The Peale goes
over the mantel.

03:38.536 --> 03:40.603
Wait! Come back.

03:44.843 --> 03:47.677
DORIS:<i> He left his wife and</i>
<i>young heir back in Philadelphia</i>

03:47.679 --> 03:49.345
<i> to be down at his</i>
<i> Carolina castle</i>

03:49.347 --> 03:52.248
<i> with his lover and his art.</i>

03:52.250 --> 03:54.016
<i> He positioned each one</i>
<i> carefully,</i>

03:54.018 --> 03:56.285
<i> often rotating them</i>
<i> from room to room.</i>

04:00.892 --> 04:02.391
Bring the Gainsborough in here

04:02.393 --> 04:04.660
and put her opposite
the new Peale.

04:06.097 --> 04:09.432
He needs someone to talk to
when we aren't here.

04:23.548 --> 04:26.349
(heavy breathing)

04:33.391 --> 04:34.757
(sighs)

04:34.759 --> 04:37.727
They judge us.

04:37.729 --> 04:39.562
I can see the way they look.

04:39.564 --> 04:43.132
I should get rid of
all of them except for you.

04:43.134 --> 04:46.969
Then I would be working all day
instead of playing

04:46.971 --> 04:49.472
with this.
(deep breath)

04:49.474 --> 04:51.140
(moans)

04:53.611 --> 04:56.145
The art never judges.

04:58.082 --> 04:59.615
I envy it.

04:59.617 --> 05:03.085
Life in two dimensions.

05:03.087 --> 05:07.456
Frozen in forever beauty.

05:07.458 --> 05:11.427
To watch the world go by
unencumbered by the gossip

05:11.429 --> 05:15.531
and the pain
of three-dimensional men.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.804
I love them, you know?

05:21.806 --> 05:25.141
The paintings.

05:25.143 --> 05:27.844
Even more than I love you.

05:27.846 --> 05:32.114
Stop talking and
make love to me.

05:32.116 --> 05:35.484
Fine.

05:35.486 --> 05:39.188
But first let's rouge
each other's nipples.

05:43.127 --> 05:44.961
DORIS:<i> Edward wasn't there</i>
<i> two days before</i>

05:44.963 --> 05:47.296
<i> things started getting</i>
<i> extremely weird.</i>

05:47.298 --> 05:48.598
(metallic bang)

05:51.803 --> 05:54.770
(glass shatters)

05:59.677 --> 06:01.878
(panicked breathing)

06:27.538 --> 06:30.139
No. No.

06:31.743 --> 06:33.809
No...

06:38.683 --> 06:40.249
(screams)

06:43.354 --> 06:46.822
(anguished cry)

06:49.060 --> 06:51.227
Which one?

06:51.229 --> 06:54.764
Which one of you destroyed
my Peale?!

06:55.767 --> 06:57.700
Speak up!

06:57.702 --> 07:00.036
Goddamn you!
Speak up!

07:00.038 --> 07:01.103
(crying)

07:01.105 --> 07:03.439
Speak up!
Speak up!

07:03.441 --> 07:05.541
GIRL: Mr. Mott!

07:05.543 --> 07:09.712
I swear... I saw a big
white woman and a young man

07:09.714 --> 07:11.047
in the yard by the woods

07:11.049 --> 07:13.349
a few minutes before
you screamed.

07:20.058 --> 07:21.424
Lies!

07:21.426 --> 07:24.894
Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies!

07:24.896 --> 07:26.295
(door creeks)

07:30.735 --> 07:34.403
You will stay there until the
murderer confesses his crime.

07:34.405 --> 07:35.471
(whimpering)

07:35.473 --> 07:36.472
(gunshot)

07:36.474 --> 07:37.873
(screams)

07:44.949 --> 07:47.083
There are your thief's rations!

07:47.085 --> 07:48.951
You can fight over them!

07:48.953 --> 07:50.720
(whimpering)

07:53.658 --> 07:54.757
Close it up!

07:54.759 --> 07:57.193
WOMAN:
No, no!

08:14.946 --> 08:17.246
Do not judge me.

08:19.450 --> 08:22.118
Need I remind you that you are
a servant as well?

08:22.120 --> 08:24.653
Do not think
your velvet tongue

08:24.655 --> 08:28.190
and purple cockhead are enough
to make you any more than that.

08:32.030 --> 08:35.297
Do not find yourself in my sight
for the rest of the night!

08:35.299 --> 08:38.034
Or blood will spill!

08:41.706 --> 08:43.372
(gasps)

08:46.711 --> 08:48.511
What we know of the rest
of that night,

08:48.513 --> 08:52.048
and the apparent end of Edward
Mott, was told by Guiness.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.396
(screech)

09:08.332 --> 09:09.698
EDWARD: Ugh!

09:09.700 --> 09:10.833
(screams)

09:10.835 --> 09:11.901
(tearing)

09:11.903 --> 09:14.770
(screams)

09:19.510 --> 09:20.910
(distant chanting)

09:26.584 --> 09:27.917
(gasps)

09:32.090 --> 09:34.190
(metallic scraping)

09:34.192 --> 09:35.858
(chanting in Old English)

09:35.860 --> 09:39.028
(yells)
Unhand me, you fools!

09:39.030 --> 09:40.529
Who are you?!

09:40.531 --> 09:42.064
This is my land! Mine!

09:42.066 --> 09:43.365
You are trespassing!

09:43.367 --> 09:45.101
THOMASIN:
This land is mine.

09:45.103 --> 09:48.037
This land will always be mine,

09:48.039 --> 09:52.775
and I shall consecrate my holy
right to it with thy blood!

09:56.881 --> 09:58.781
No!

09:58.783 --> 10:00.049
No!

10:00.051 --> 10:01.383
No!

10:01.385 --> 10:02.451
No!

10:02.453 --> 10:03.552
(slicing sound)

10:03.554 --> 10:05.621
(groans)

10:07.959 --> 10:12.828
(gasping and choking)

10:18.903 --> 10:21.303
(screaming)

10:23.441 --> 10:25.908
At some point during all
of this apparent mayhem,

10:25.910 --> 10:27.910
Guiness rode away
on one of the horses.

10:27.912 --> 10:31.247
But no body or evidence of
a giant fire was ever found.

10:31.249 --> 10:32.915
Guiness ended up in jail,

10:32.917 --> 10:35.751
accused of murdering his master
and hiding the body.

10:35.753 --> 10:38.954
<i> He neglected to tell anyone</i>

10:38.956 --> 10:42.992
<i> about the servants</i>
<i> in the root cellar, though.</i>

10:47.999 --> 10:49.598
<i> The house remained</i>
<i> in the Mott trust</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:51.167
<i> for over a century,</i>
<i> but it was said that</i>

10:51.169 --> 10:53.135
<i> madness always ran</i>
<i> in the family.</i>

10:53.137 --> 10:55.771
The line ended in scandal
when the last Mott died

10:55.773 --> 10:58.274
in South Florida in 1952.

10:58.276 --> 11:01.010
At that point the house was
bought and sold a few times,

11:01.012 --> 11:03.112
but no one ever stayed for long.

11:03.114 --> 11:04.847
PRODUCER:
Do you believe it was haunted?

11:04.849 --> 11:06.782
Do I?
I'm an historian.

11:06.784 --> 11:09.952
It would make my life a lot
easier if the dead came back.

11:09.954 --> 11:12.521
All I can say at this point is
that no one will convince me

11:12.523 --> 11:14.623
to stay in that house overnight,

11:14.625 --> 11:17.026
certainly not at a full moon.

11:37.648 --> 11:40.115
Matt?

11:44.388 --> 11:45.654
THOMASIN:
Deliver yourselves

11:45.656 --> 11:47.556
unto me,

11:47.558 --> 11:49.191
and I shall grant you

11:49.193 --> 11:51.160
a merciful death.

11:51.162 --> 11:56.065
MATT:
<i> It was... surreal.</i>

11:56.067 --> 11:59.335
This wasn't just
weird sounds in the woods

11:59.337 --> 12:01.170
or knives left in the ceiling.

12:01.172 --> 12:02.371
This was a mob,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.006
and they were coming for us.

12:04.008 --> 12:05.908
It didn't matter
if they were alive or dead,

12:05.910 --> 12:09.178
or what they were, I just knew
that we had to get out of there.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.080
AMBROSE:
Usurpers!

12:11.082 --> 12:13.249
Your time is nigh.

12:13.251 --> 12:16.752
The Blood Moon is upon us.

12:16.754 --> 12:20.089
We must honor our covenant
with the ancient gods

12:20.091 --> 12:22.558
and consecrate
this land once again.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.428
You were given opportunity
to cede this territory.

12:26.430 --> 12:27.863
As you did not,

12:27.865 --> 12:30.733
your end shall be
a merciless reckoning.

12:30.735 --> 12:33.102
Oh, God.

12:33.104 --> 12:35.704
What do we do?
Take my keys.

12:35.706 --> 12:37.373
I'll go out first
and lead them away.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.541
Oh, no.

12:39.543 --> 12:42.077
You take Flora and go
straight to the truck.

12:42.079 --> 12:43.912
Matt, please.

12:43.914 --> 12:45.281
Please, we have
to stay together.

12:45.283 --> 12:46.715
Listen to me,

12:46.717 --> 12:48.217
You have to get
Flora out of here.

12:48.219 --> 12:50.552
Okay. Okay.
I need you both safe.

12:50.554 --> 12:52.788
All right, now, once you
go through the front door,

12:52.790 --> 12:54.056
go straight to the truck.

12:54.058 --> 12:55.391
No matter what
happens, don't stop.

12:55.393 --> 12:57.293
Okay. Yes.
Promise?

12:57.295 --> 12:58.994
Uncle Matt, I'm scared.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.899
I know, honey.

13:03.901 --> 13:05.434
I need you to be brave

13:05.436 --> 13:08.570
just for a little
while longer, okay?

13:08.572 --> 13:10.239
Okay.

13:10.241 --> 13:12.241
Okay.
(panting):
Okay.

13:12.243 --> 13:13.909
Okay.

13:13.911 --> 13:15.311
Come on.

13:18.115 --> 13:20.249
SHELBY:
Look at me.

13:20.251 --> 13:23.152
Hold on to me as tight
as you can.

13:23.154 --> 13:25.087
Do you understand?
Mm-hmm.

13:25.089 --> 13:26.355
Do not let go.

13:39.136 --> 13:41.837
(screaming)

13:43.341 --> 13:45.474
(screaming)

13:45.476 --> 13:46.942
(echoing):
Flora!

13:46.944 --> 13:50.646
You could feel the house...

13:50.648 --> 13:53.982
coming alive around you.

13:53.984 --> 13:56.018
(panting)

13:56.020 --> 13:57.286
SHELBY:
Flora?

13:57.288 --> 13:58.921
Flora!

14:02.626 --> 14:03.926
Flora!

14:16.307 --> 14:18.540
Oh, shit.

14:19.844 --> 14:21.377
Matt!

14:22.680 --> 14:25.681
Flora?

14:25.683 --> 14:27.149
Flora!

14:27.151 --> 14:30.719
(Flora sobbing)

14:32.223 --> 14:34.223
Look at me.

14:34.225 --> 14:36.325
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

14:36.327 --> 14:37.793
(skittering)

14:44.335 --> 14:45.801
(loud thumps)

14:48.005 --> 14:49.405
(gun cocks)

14:51.842 --> 14:53.342
(inhuman howling)

14:53.344 --> 14:55.677
Come on, come on.
(grunts)

14:55.679 --> 14:57.746
Come on.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.250
MATT:
<i> It's like we'd been led there.</i>

15:01.252 --> 15:02.918
I didn't understand at first.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.020
Elias...

15:05.022 --> 15:09.191
Elias said that past victims of
The Butcher were afraid of her.

15:09.193 --> 15:11.860
Later on I realized
that she used that fear

15:11.862 --> 15:14.096
<i> to make them do what she</i>
<i> wanted. They corralled us.</i>

15:14.098 --> 15:17.866
AMBROSE: Usurpers!
<i> Like animals for an easy</i>
<i> slaughter.</i>

15:17.868 --> 15:20.068
(Shelby panting, door slams)

15:20.070 --> 15:21.437
(chopping door in distance)

15:23.541 --> 15:27.376
What now?

15:27.378 --> 15:28.777
We're trapped.

15:28.779 --> 15:30.546
EDWARD: Perhaps I may be
of some assistance.

15:30.548 --> 15:32.214
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

15:32.216 --> 15:34.283
No need for violence!
My intent is not to harm you.

15:34.285 --> 15:35.751
In fact it is to save you.

15:35.753 --> 15:37.753
If you let me,

15:37.755 --> 15:40.255
I can help you
escape this house.

15:40.257 --> 15:41.757
(pounding on door in distance)

15:41.759 --> 15:43.826
Yes, yes.

15:49.633 --> 15:51.567
That's right, in we go.

15:51.569 --> 15:52.568
SHELBY:
<i> He told us his name.</i>

15:52.570 --> 15:54.403
<i> Edward Philippe Mott.</i>

15:54.405 --> 15:57.906
And that he was
the original owner.

15:57.908 --> 15:59.975
As many questions
as that raised,

15:59.977 --> 16:01.977
we-we didn't have time
for any more details.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.745
MATT:
<i> Where are you taking us?</i>

16:03.747 --> 16:06.415
EDWARD: Safety.
MATT: Where do these
tunnels lead?

16:06.417 --> 16:07.983
I thought the hillbillies
built them.

16:07.985 --> 16:09.485
I built them.

16:09.487 --> 16:10.819
You're not...

16:11.755 --> 16:13.422
You're not alive.

16:13.424 --> 16:15.424
No, The Butcher killed me.

16:15.426 --> 16:16.792
I will keep her
from killing you.

16:16.794 --> 16:18.594
No more, no less.

16:18.596 --> 16:20.262
Is that why you appeared?

16:20.264 --> 16:21.697
To save us?

16:27.605 --> 16:28.837
No.

16:28.839 --> 16:31.607
You're my bane.

16:31.609 --> 16:33.675
My ruin.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.677
We're no threat to you.

16:35.679 --> 16:38.780
All that I was is no more.

16:38.782 --> 16:41.149
Everything precious
turned to dust.

16:41.151 --> 16:44.620
I have but one last
sliver of grace.

16:44.622 --> 16:48.290
My solitude, such as it is.

16:48.292 --> 16:52.327
I can hardly suffer
three more souls.

16:52.329 --> 16:55.831
SHELBY:
<i> We must've walked a mile</i>

16:55.833 --> 16:58.467
<i> in the dank and dark.</i>

16:58.469 --> 17:01.169
In some places the walls
were moving,

17:01.171 --> 17:04.172
infested with insects.

17:04.174 --> 17:07.042
It smelled like a grave.

17:17.988 --> 17:19.888
FLORA:
I'm cold.

17:19.890 --> 17:23.492
Well, better cold than the heat
from The Butcher's flames.

17:23.494 --> 17:25.661
MATT:
Will this take us to the road?

17:25.663 --> 17:27.496
EDWARD:
There are no roads where I go.

17:27.498 --> 17:29.331
SHELBY:
If we're not going to the road,

17:29.333 --> 17:31.199
then where the hell
are you taking us?

17:31.201 --> 17:32.701
We can't go aimlessly
into the woods.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.369
We'll die of exposure.

17:34.371 --> 17:37.673
(grunts)

17:37.675 --> 17:41.710
This is as far as I care
to take you.

17:41.712 --> 17:46.014
The living cling
to life above all,

17:46.016 --> 17:49.518
but the trophy misprized

17:49.520 --> 17:53.522
is to die in peace.

17:53.524 --> 17:54.990
(blows)

18:02.199 --> 18:04.199
Come on, let's go.

18:04.201 --> 18:07.836
Some animals are afraid
of the light.

18:09.373 --> 18:11.373
Their instinct is
to stay hidden from it

18:11.375 --> 18:14.543
because darkness means safety

18:14.545 --> 18:18.046
and protection from predators.

18:18.048 --> 18:20.382
We should have known
that in that forest,

18:20.384 --> 18:23.051
<i>we were nothing more than prey.</i>

18:23.053 --> 18:24.586
I see a light.

18:24.588 --> 18:27.923
(distant grunting and squealing)

18:27.925 --> 18:30.459
Pigs.

18:34.898 --> 18:36.298
(screaming)

18:45.476 --> 18:49.544
In the darkness, we didn't
recognize where we were.

18:51.315 --> 18:54.082
But it was that same house
where we'd seen those feral boys

18:54.084 --> 18:56.418
<i> suckling the pig.</i>

18:56.420 --> 18:57.919
<i> And we weren't alone.</i>

18:57.921 --> 18:59.421
(both gasp)

18:59.423 --> 19:00.756
(man groaning)

19:00.758 --> 19:04.259
Oh, help me, help me.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:04.261 --> 19:05.927
No, honey, don't look,
don't look, don't look.

19:05.929 --> 19:08.764
Don't look.
Elias?

19:08.766 --> 19:11.600
What have you done to him?
You got it wrong.

19:11.602 --> 19:12.968
We found him full of holes.

19:12.970 --> 19:16.505
Arrows stuck out of him
like a porcupine.

19:16.507 --> 19:19.341
Mama worked her magic
to keep him alive.

19:19.343 --> 19:20.942
Mama worked her magic.

19:20.944 --> 19:23.011
Why didn't you take him
to a hospital?

19:23.013 --> 19:25.514
He weren't no use
to nobody but us.

19:25.516 --> 19:26.848
No use to nobody.

19:26.850 --> 19:28.850
See for yourself.

19:28.852 --> 19:30.452
No...

19:30.454 --> 19:31.620
(Elias moaning)

19:31.622 --> 19:33.655
No....

19:33.657 --> 19:37.526
No more, no more...

19:37.528 --> 19:40.028
(groaning)

19:41.632 --> 19:43.832
Elias?
Yeah.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.934
It's me, Matt Miller.

19:49.139 --> 19:50.639
Hi, Matt.

19:50.641 --> 19:52.641
(chuckles)

19:52.643 --> 19:54.643
They're all crazy.

19:54.645 --> 19:56.978
You have to get out of here.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.881
Get out before she comes.

19:59.883 --> 20:02.551
Look at me in pieces.

20:02.553 --> 20:05.253
Mama took my leg.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.724
(crying):
Mama took my leg.

20:12.029 --> 20:13.829
(Elias moaning)

20:13.831 --> 20:15.664
Kill me... kill me.

20:15.666 --> 20:16.732
Kill me!

20:19.236 --> 20:21.703
(shudders)

20:21.705 --> 20:24.306
(sniffles)

20:26.677 --> 20:29.010
(door creaks open)

20:29.012 --> 20:31.847
Y'all must be famished.

20:31.849 --> 20:34.516
I got fresh jerky
from the smokehouse.

20:34.518 --> 20:35.684
ELIAS:
No, don't eat it.

20:35.686 --> 20:36.885
Don't eat it.

20:36.887 --> 20:37.986
Hush it.

20:39.690 --> 20:40.922
Please don't hurt him.

20:40.924 --> 20:42.190
Another word and you bring

20:42.192 --> 20:44.092
that hammer down on his teeth.

20:44.094 --> 20:45.360
(Elias moans)

20:45.362 --> 20:47.896
Help yourself, now.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.599
No, thanks.

20:53.036 --> 20:54.936
Take it, child.

20:54.938 --> 20:56.938
It's delicious.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.106
No thank you.
(Flora grunts)

20:58.108 --> 20:59.541
She's not hungry.

20:59.543 --> 21:01.943
Don't act all biggety.

21:01.945 --> 21:04.045
You're no better than us.

21:04.047 --> 21:06.715
I offer food
to welcome you to my home.

21:06.717 --> 21:08.650
It's not poison.

21:13.223 --> 21:14.723
Shit!

21:14.725 --> 21:16.925
Rancid!

21:16.927 --> 21:19.261
I like my meat sweet.

21:19.263 --> 21:21.062
I spent hours curing this!
(both gasp)

21:21.064 --> 21:22.464
It's his fault.

21:22.466 --> 21:23.598
He's bad meat.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.733
Bad meat!

21:24.735 --> 21:26.568
He's spoilt.

21:26.570 --> 21:29.971
No reason to keep it alive.

21:29.973 --> 21:31.439
(screams)

21:31.441 --> 21:34.142
(crying)

21:34.144 --> 21:35.610
(gasps)

21:35.612 --> 21:38.413
You should've never
bought that house.

21:38.415 --> 21:39.948
Come here with your big money.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.284
Outbid Ishmael at the auction.

21:42.286 --> 21:43.819
You can have it.

21:43.821 --> 21:45.420
Move in tomorrow.

21:45.422 --> 21:47.489
We'll sign the deed
over to you right now.

21:47.491 --> 21:48.924
We don't want to live there.

21:48.926 --> 21:51.159
We got places
all over out here.

21:51.161 --> 21:53.428
We wanted to keep it empty
for The Butcher.

21:53.430 --> 21:56.264
She don't like no company.

21:56.266 --> 21:59.835
My kin made a deal with her
over 200 years ago.

21:59.837 --> 22:02.604
So long as she can
consecrate the land

22:02.606 --> 22:06.141
with fresh blood every year,
she'll leave us alone.

22:06.143 --> 22:08.310
Some years
when the pickings are slim,

22:08.312 --> 22:10.312
we help provide the sacrifice.

22:10.314 --> 22:13.949
In turn, nobody steps
foot in the forest

22:13.951 --> 22:15.650
and disturbs our crop.

22:15.652 --> 22:19.120
That cannabis grow tall
in this Carolina soil.

22:19.122 --> 22:21.356
Why are you telling us this?

22:21.358 --> 22:22.691
Why not?

22:22.693 --> 22:24.793
You ain't never
gonna tell nobody.

22:24.795 --> 22:25.861
No.

22:25.863 --> 22:27.128
We won't.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.630
I swear it.

22:28.632 --> 22:30.198
No, sir.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.367
You won't say a peep.

22:32.369 --> 22:34.636
Not a peep.

22:34.638 --> 22:37.505
ISHMAEL: I ain't forgot
you led the police here

22:37.507 --> 22:39.140
and took away our babies.

22:39.142 --> 22:40.308
My babies.

22:40.310 --> 22:41.676
My babies!

22:41.678 --> 22:44.212
We gonna get the boys
back, I promise.

22:44.214 --> 22:47.482
Please, please just let us go.

22:47.484 --> 22:50.485
We will go back
to California

22:50.487 --> 22:51.853
and no one will
ever see us again.

22:51.855 --> 22:55.056
No, they won't, sweet meat.

22:55.058 --> 22:57.993
The Polks have always been
as good as their word.

22:57.995 --> 22:59.227
We have a deal with The Butcher,

22:59.229 --> 23:02.197
and she's gonna get you back.

23:02.199 --> 23:06.401
As much as I wanted
to get away from the Polks...

23:06.403 --> 23:09.838
there was only one place
worse than where I was.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.108
And that was our house.

23:22.352 --> 23:25.020
It was Shelby.
She called the cops,

23:25.022 --> 23:27.055
telling them that
I had something to do

23:27.057 --> 23:28.924
with my husband's death.

23:28.926 --> 23:30.759
That's why
they were holding me

23:30.761 --> 23:34.095
and questioning me
over and over again.

23:34.097 --> 23:36.898
I knew what they were doing.
I was a cop.

23:36.900 --> 23:39.901
They only had 48 hours
before they had to charge me.

23:39.903 --> 23:41.703
48 wasted hours,

23:41.705 --> 23:45.240
when I could've been
out there looking for Flora.

23:45.242 --> 23:46.708
Let's go over this again.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.109
Your sister-in-law told us

23:48.111 --> 23:50.879
you left around
a quarter after 10:00 p.m.

23:50.881 --> 23:53.548
15 minutes
after your ex-husband.

23:53.550 --> 23:56.284
Now, you didn't come back
until about four hours later.

23:56.286 --> 23:57.585
What were you doing?

23:57.587 --> 23:59.054
How many times do you want me

23:59.056 --> 24:00.555
to tell you the same story?

24:00.557 --> 24:02.090
You took your daughter
from school

24:02.092 --> 24:03.892
without permission.

24:03.894 --> 24:05.560
You knew
your ex-husband was gonna

24:05.562 --> 24:07.562
turn you in
for kidnapping.

24:07.564 --> 24:08.997
Is that why you killed him?

24:10.934 --> 24:12.567
These are facts, Lee.

24:12.569 --> 24:14.135
I went out that night
to look for my daughter,

24:14.137 --> 24:17.105
which is what we both
should be doing right now.

24:17.107 --> 24:20.575
Come on, look at
how you found Mason!

24:20.577 --> 24:22.077
Do you honestly think

24:22.079 --> 24:24.079
that I could lift a grown man

24:24.081 --> 24:26.581
into that wooden thing?

24:26.583 --> 24:28.483
Not by yourself.

24:31.588 --> 24:33.922
I had nothing to do
with Mason's death.

24:33.924 --> 24:36.658
So you either charge
me or let me go.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.660
<i> They tried for every minute</i>

24:38.662 --> 24:41.963
<i> of that 48 hours to catch me</i>
<i> in an inconsistency.</i>

24:41.965 --> 24:43.965
But there was no lie to catch.

24:43.967 --> 24:45.667
Because like Mark Twain said,

24:45.669 --> 24:47.936
"If you tell the truth,

24:47.938 --> 24:50.338
you don't have
to remember anything."

24:51.975 --> 24:53.808
<i> When I turned on my phone,</i>
<i> I had, like,</i>

24:53.810 --> 24:56.111
<i> 20 texts from Matt.</i>

24:56.113 --> 24:57.946
I couldn't make sense
of them at the time.

24:57.948 --> 25:00.782
They were all pretty frantic.

25:00.784 --> 25:03.018
<i> There was only one message</i>
<i> that mattered.</i>

25:04.788 --> 25:06.855
My baby was safe.

25:06.857 --> 25:09.357
(heavy rattling)

25:19.803 --> 25:21.536
Every time that truck bounced,

25:21.538 --> 25:24.372
I was sure that gun
would go off.

25:24.374 --> 25:26.975
I just needed a moment.

25:26.977 --> 25:30.245
<i> Just one.</i>

25:34.151 --> 25:35.817
Slow down, peckerhead!

25:35.819 --> 25:37.218
(Shelby shouting)

25:38.989 --> 25:40.889
(both screaming)

25:44.161 --> 25:46.194
(grunting)

25:46.196 --> 25:47.362
Cain!

25:47.364 --> 25:48.730
(gasping)

26:00.177 --> 26:02.077
MATT:
<i> I knew I had to make a move.</i>

26:02.079 --> 26:03.411
Come on, come on.

26:03.413 --> 26:05.046
Come on, girl.
Come on, Flora.

26:05.048 --> 26:06.347
<i> We were gonna die</i>
<i> if The Butcher</i>

26:06.349 --> 26:08.349
<i> got her hands on us again.</i>

26:08.351 --> 26:11.286
(indistinct shouting)

26:12.556 --> 26:14.022
I figured I'd rather us
take our chances

26:14.024 --> 26:17.092
in the woods than be
slaughtered like pigs.

26:17.094 --> 26:18.760
Get down.

26:18.762 --> 26:20.395
Get down, get down, get down.

26:20.397 --> 26:22.931
(panting)

26:28.738 --> 26:31.039
(Shelby gasps)

26:31.041 --> 26:32.607
(shushing)

26:32.609 --> 26:34.776
(crickets chirping)

26:41.885 --> 26:43.685
(phone buzzing)
(Shelby shushing)

26:45.555 --> 26:48.556
(gasps)

26:48.558 --> 26:49.991
(gun cocks)

26:52.062 --> 26:54.295
(gasping)

26:57.467 --> 26:59.968
Whatever was going down,
it was bad.

27:01.238 --> 27:03.471
Matt wouldn't just
ignore my call.

27:03.473 --> 27:05.740
Especially if he had Flora.

27:05.742 --> 27:07.809
Officer!

27:11.148 --> 27:13.781
I need a ride.

27:13.783 --> 27:15.850
(shouts)

27:24.127 --> 27:26.161
(truck creaks)

27:27.497 --> 27:28.763
Put the girl
in the truck.

27:28.765 --> 27:30.999
No child should
have to see this.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.634
(Ishmael grunts)
No, no!

27:32.636 --> 27:33.935
Pl...

27:33.937 --> 27:35.336
You fashion yourself a hero,

27:35.338 --> 27:37.272
don't you?

27:37.274 --> 27:38.506
Real brave and such.

27:38.508 --> 27:40.808
You come onto my land.

27:40.810 --> 27:42.177
Take my babies.

27:42.179 --> 27:44.345
Kill my son!

27:44.347 --> 27:46.781
If she didn't want you so bad,

27:46.783 --> 27:49.017
I'd bash your skull in
right now!

27:49.019 --> 27:50.685
And I tell you what.

27:50.687 --> 27:52.120
(footsteps)

27:52.122 --> 27:54.189
You ain't running again!

27:54.191 --> 27:55.323
SHELBY:
No! No!

27:55.325 --> 27:56.524
Please don't hurt him!

27:56.526 --> 27:58.293
Please, I beg you!
I beg you!

27:58.295 --> 27:59.627
I beg you.

27:59.629 --> 28:01.129
MATT: Do whatever
you want to me.

28:01.131 --> 28:02.797
I won't run again.

28:02.799 --> 28:04.699
Oh, I know you won't!

28:06.836 --> 28:09.270
(screaming)

28:10.674 --> 28:13.141
Shelby.

28:13.143 --> 28:14.943
(screaming)

28:18.315 --> 28:20.748
I've never felt more useless.

28:23.653 --> 28:27.222
I don't really
remember much after that.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.594
(Shelby groaning)

28:39.836 --> 28:41.569
(shushing)

28:41.571 --> 28:43.238
Matt.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.740
Look at me.

28:47.510 --> 28:50.078
You have to save her.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.580
You have
to save Flora.

28:52.582 --> 28:54.249
(shushing)

28:54.251 --> 28:56.884
You have to save...

28:56.886 --> 28:59.053
(shushing)

28:59.055 --> 29:01.256
Promise me you'll save her.

29:01.258 --> 29:03.591
(whimpers)

29:03.593 --> 29:05.360
Promise me you'll save her.

29:05.362 --> 29:08.196
(shushes)

29:08.198 --> 29:09.564
(sobbing)

29:09.566 --> 29:12.100
(sighing)

29:13.737 --> 29:16.904
I gave up.
There was no way out.

29:16.906 --> 29:19.107
I just tried to soak up
every last second

29:19.109 --> 29:20.875
I had left with Shelby
'cause I knew,

29:20.877 --> 29:24.879
when that truck stopped...

29:24.881 --> 29:27.282
it was all over.

29:47.237 --> 29:49.704
¶ ¶

29:58.982 --> 30:02.250
There were still so many things

30:02.252 --> 30:05.486
I wanted to do with my life.

30:06.756 --> 30:08.656
Be a mother.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.827
Grow old with Matt.

30:14.664 --> 30:17.999
Open up my own yoga studio.

30:19.002 --> 30:22.337
And I always thought that...

30:22.339 --> 30:26.007
I'd have all the time
in the world.

30:26.009 --> 30:27.608
<i> But our time was up.</i>

30:27.610 --> 30:30.044
(Shelby gasping, grunting)

30:44.127 --> 30:47.528
Thou hath lost a son tonight.

30:47.530 --> 30:52.533
'Tis a mother's burden
to suffer the birth of her babe,

30:52.535 --> 30:56.037
but all agony pales
when placed in measure

30:56.039 --> 30:58.906
with the cold death
of their child.

31:04.147 --> 31:05.880
Back in the truck, boys.

31:13.056 --> 31:14.422
(Shelby whimpers)

31:20.330 --> 31:22.330
No, no.

31:22.332 --> 31:24.165
No!

31:24.167 --> 31:25.666
No, no, no, no!

31:25.668 --> 31:27.502
No, no, no...

31:27.504 --> 31:30.171
(crying, pleading continues)

31:30.173 --> 31:32.440
No!
(screams)

31:34.010 --> 31:35.943
No!

31:40.583 --> 31:43.017
You promised she would be last.

31:43.019 --> 31:45.086
Now she goeth first.

31:47.357 --> 31:49.690
(Flora screams)

31:49.692 --> 31:51.759
(screaming)

31:51.761 --> 31:53.094
BOTH:
Flora!

31:53.096 --> 31:55.596
(screaming)

32:01.371 --> 32:04.038
It was...

32:04.040 --> 32:06.707
inhuman.

32:06.709 --> 32:09.777
I mean, sh...
she was just a little girl.

32:10.947 --> 32:13.815
They were monsters.

32:20.256 --> 32:22.056
LEE:
My God.

32:22.058 --> 32:24.325
Call for backup.

32:27.230 --> 32:29.297
Wait. No, wait.

32:29.299 --> 32:30.364
Wait, wait!

32:32.402 --> 32:33.568
(Flora screaming)

32:33.570 --> 32:35.069
Shit!

32:35.071 --> 32:38.906
This land belongs to the colony,

32:38.908 --> 32:41.642
and the colony to the land.

32:41.644 --> 32:45.580
We consecrate our holy right
with blood!

32:45.582 --> 32:47.248
(whimpering)

32:47.250 --> 32:49.217
No!

32:51.754 --> 32:53.120
SHELBY:
<i> It was one of her own.</i>

32:53.122 --> 32:54.922
I don't understand
why he did it,

32:54.924 --> 32:56.457
but he stopped her.

32:56.459 --> 32:58.593
I shall not stand by
and watch thou

32:58.595 --> 33:01.329
shed another drop
of innocent blood!

33:25.622 --> 33:28.456
Go on, now,
make your grand escape.

33:28.458 --> 33:30.191
SHELBY:
I can't, I can't move, Matt...

33:30.193 --> 33:33.594

33:39.869 --> 33:41.469
Get in!

33:41.471 --> 33:43.871

33:43.873 --> 33:45.473
MATT: Flora!

33:45.475 --> 33:46.874
Flora!

33:51.814 --> 33:52.880
MATT: Go, go!

33:52.882 --> 33:54.682
Lee, go, go, go!

33:54.684 --> 33:56.384
(tires screeching)

34:00.490 --> 34:03.324
It was a miracle.

34:03.326 --> 34:06.394
After all we'd been through,
I...

34:06.396 --> 34:10.164
I still can't explain
half the crazy things we saw.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.400
We were lucky to be alive.

34:12.402 --> 34:17.271
Those months were like
a terrifying nightmare.

34:18.741 --> 34:22.343
When I close my eyes,
I can still see...

34:22.345 --> 34:26.247
the fire and... Elias screaming.

34:26.249 --> 34:30.585
That... insane family.

34:33.189 --> 34:36.424
I'm just grateful
that I will never have to see

34:36.426 --> 34:38.926
that god-awful place again.

34:38.928 --> 34:42.063
We only had enough cash
on hand for a motel room

34:42.065 --> 34:43.931
and some takeout.

34:47.103 --> 34:49.870
Okay.
All right, baby.

34:49.872 --> 34:52.940
Let's get you
all cleaned up.

34:53.943 --> 34:55.776
Thank you.

35:16.566 --> 35:18.566
Ooh, me next.

35:18.568 --> 35:20.301
(sighs) You sure
that's a good idea,

35:20.303 --> 35:21.802
with your cast

35:21.804 --> 35:25.272
I am filthy,
I smell terrible.

35:25.274 --> 35:27.608
Try and stop me.

35:27.610 --> 35:31.312
We're okay, baby.
We're okay.

35:45.495 --> 35:47.662
Flora?
Hmm?

35:47.664 --> 35:49.930
Did you save a slice
for your Uncle Matt?

35:49.932 --> 35:52.800
I don't know, Uncle Matt,
I was pretty hungry.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.402

36:01.678 --> 36:03.544
Mmm, good stuff.

meditation, hypnotherapy even.

We escaped with our lives
that night,

36:23.466 --> 36:27.268
but I never completely
got over it.

36:29.472 --> 36:32.273
I'm not sure I ever will.
