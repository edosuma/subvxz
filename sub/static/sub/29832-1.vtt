WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(music plays)

00:15.883 --> 00:17.349
I'm nervous, Tinkertoes!

00:17.351 --> 00:21.086
King Bedwyr has never asked to
see us personally before now...

00:21.088 --> 00:23.622
do you think we did
something wrong?

00:23.624 --> 00:27.126
If we did, I can't imagine what
it would've been, Cai!

00:27.128 --> 00:29.962
Unless he's taken exception
to the hopscotch grid

00:29.964 --> 00:32.631
you drew with chalk outside
the Wee Kingdom castle!

00:32.633 --> 00:35.034
But, it's a chalk
drawing on rock!

00:35.036 --> 00:37.069
The rain will wash it right off!

00:37.071 --> 00:40.039
Even the mountain's morning
dew will cause it to fade!

00:40.041 --> 00:42.808
Besides, no one even
knows I drew it,

00:42.810 --> 00:44.376
they all think it was you!

00:44.378 --> 00:46.595
Me?!

00:46.596 --> 00:48.813
But, I've never graffitied
anything in my life!

00:48.816 --> 00:52.518
I'm a flying creature!
I don't even play hopscotch!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.987
I wouldn't even know how,
if I wanted to!

00:54.989 --> 00:56.789
Oh, that's regrettable,
Tinkertoes!

00:56.791 --> 00:58.323
How about you let me teach you?

00:58.325 --> 00:59.725
Uh-uh!

00:59.727 --> 01:01.694
No can do!

01:01.695 --> 01:03.662
Not if it's going to get me in
hot water with the king!

01:03.664 --> 01:05.964
Now, we don't know that that's
what his issue is!

01:05.966 --> 01:08.600
It may be something
else entirely!

01:08.602 --> 01:10.969
Like you sleeping in the
kingdom's only

01:10.971 --> 01:12.771
peach tree during the day!

01:12.773 --> 01:15.240
Your sleeping weight
broke all the branches,

01:15.242 --> 01:17.342
and now the tree
won't grow fruit!

01:17.344 --> 01:19.378
(gasps)

01:19.379 --> 01:21.413
Really? I didn't mean
for that to happen!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.348
I just hang upside
down and get

01:23.350 --> 01:25.451
a nice snooze
in every morning!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.753
I guess I'm getting bigger...

01:27.755 --> 01:30.456
I'm not the teeny fairy-bat
I once was!

01:30.458 --> 01:32.758
The kingdom may want
restitution!

01:32.760 --> 01:35.727
King Bedwyr may order
you to plant a new tree!

01:35.729 --> 01:36.762
I can do that!

01:36.764 --> 01:39.865
Oh, I feel terrible if that's
what's happened!

01:39.867 --> 01:41.533
Just terrible!

01:41.535 --> 01:43.602
One thing's for certain -
we won't know

01:43.604 --> 01:46.371
what this is all about, until
we answer King Bedwyr's call

01:46.373 --> 01:48.474
and go to the castle to
hear what he has to say!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.876
Are you sure he
wants to see us both?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.695
That's what Gurgle said!

01:52.696 --> 01:54.513
And Gurgle knows everything that
goes on around here!

01:54.515 --> 01:57.416
Yes, Gurgle knows too much,
if you ask me!

01:57.418 --> 02:01.153
What kinda wee dragon has such
an inside track on the kingdom,

02:01.155 --> 02:03.956
without being an official member
of the King's Wee Court?

02:03.958 --> 02:06.758
He doesn't like to
wake up to an alarm!

02:06.760 --> 02:09.995
Remember what happened when the
king gifted him a rooster?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.897
How could I forget?

02:11.899 --> 02:16.101
He set it free, and that thing
ended up cock-a-doodle-doo'ing

02:16.103 --> 02:19.805
outside everyone's
window except Gurgle's!

02:19.807 --> 02:21.240
Right!

02:21.241 --> 02:22.674
I didn't get a full night's
sleep for a week!

02:22.676 --> 02:26.211
And I had to find a tree outside
our Wee Kingdom's walls

02:26.213 --> 02:28.380
if I wanted to
get any rest at all!

02:28.382 --> 02:29.982
It was horrible!

02:29.984 --> 02:31.700
See?

02:31.701 --> 02:33.417
We can't blame King Bedwyr
for not inviting Gurgle

02:33.420 --> 02:35.237
to join the Wee Court!

02:35.238 --> 02:37.055
We wouldn't want him around
full-time either!

02:37.057 --> 02:40.425
That said, he's detail-oriented,
timely, and expedient!

02:40.427 --> 02:43.462
And don't forget a little
untrustworthy!

02:43.464 --> 02:45.864
Remember when he ate all
the cinnamon powder puffs

02:45.866 --> 02:47.432
from the bakery storefront,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.601
and blamed it on Big Boba?

02:49.603 --> 02:51.570
Aye...sugar craving does strange

02:51.572 --> 02:53.472
things to wee dragons,
Tinkertoes!

02:53.474 --> 02:54.973
You don't have to tell me!

02:54.975 --> 02:58.810
I'd fly loops for a box of
Napoleons right now!

02:58.812 --> 03:00.746
Heavens!

03:00.747 --> 03:02.681
You could never face the king
with that strong a sugar rush!

03:02.683 --> 03:05.117
Maybe one Napoleon...
but a whole box?

03:05.119 --> 03:06.118
Madness!

03:06.120 --> 03:07.452
Well, c'mon, Cai!

03:07.454 --> 03:09.588
Let's get it over with!

03:09.589 --> 03:11.723
My nerves can't take much more
of this anticipation!

03:11.725 --> 03:12.958
I agree...

03:12.960 --> 03:15.127
(sighs)

03:15.129 --> 03:16.662
...here we go.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.730
(music plays)

03:25.139 --> 03:28.774
Welcome once again
to my castle, Wees!

03:28.776 --> 03:30.309
Thank you for coming at once!

03:30.311 --> 03:32.344
I'm happy to see you!

03:32.346 --> 03:33.478
You are?

03:33.480 --> 03:36.682
We're...we're not...in trouble?

03:36.684 --> 03:37.683
Trouble?!

03:37.685 --> 03:39.484
Goodness, no!

03:39.486 --> 03:41.086
Far from it!

03:41.088 --> 03:44.022
I called you here to
ask a favor of you!

03:44.024 --> 03:45.023
(both)
A favor?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.376
Yes!

03:47.377 --> 03:49.728
I have a very important
invitation I'd like to extend,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.897
to one of our most
tentative allies

03:51.899 --> 03:58.170
in this land - nay, our most
tentative ally, by far!

03:58.172 --> 03:59.705
Oh? Who is it, King Bedwyr?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.673
Ooh, let me guess!

04:01.675 --> 04:03.141
Marlo the Mongoose!

04:03.143 --> 04:04.610
Ooh, I know!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.111
Badgum the Badger!

04:06.113 --> 04:07.112
No, no!

04:07.114 --> 04:08.614
Shaka the Sugar Glider!

04:08.616 --> 04:09.615
Shaka!

04:09.617 --> 04:10.616
Of course!

04:10.618 --> 04:12.284
Ha ha ha!

04:12.286 --> 04:15.153
Excellent picks, all, you two!

04:15.155 --> 04:18.023
But I'm afraid none are correct!

04:18.025 --> 04:19.491
No?

04:19.492 --> 04:20.958
I can't think of any other
tentative wee friends!

04:20.961 --> 04:23.128
Who could it be?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.564
Yeah, who would we
possibly send an invite to,

04:25.566 --> 04:26.965
who might not accept?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.333
Emrick the Wizard!

04:28.335 --> 04:30.669
You mean Emrick...
the evil wizard?

04:30.671 --> 04:33.272
That's exactly who I mean!

04:33.274 --> 04:36.408
But, he's no ally...he's our
sworn enemy!

04:36.410 --> 04:39.878
Are we inviting him to turn
himself in?

04:39.880 --> 04:40.545
No!

04:40.547 --> 04:42.014
Not at all!

04:42.016 --> 04:45.550
I wish to invite Emrick to
share in our upcoming

04:45.552 --> 04:48.086
Wee Thanksgiving feast!

04:48.088 --> 04:50.589
The Wee Thanksgiving feast?!

04:50.591 --> 04:51.590
And Emrick?!

04:51.592 --> 04:53.358
King Bedwyr,
you can't be serious!

04:53.360 --> 04:55.460
Do you really see our
whole Wee Kingdom

04:55.462 --> 04:58.230
gathered together in
celebration of our land...

04:58.232 --> 05:00.465
alongside
Emrick the Evil Wizard?!

05:00.467 --> 05:02.467
Now, now, Cai!

05:02.469 --> 05:05.804
Cavalierly calling that
old man an evil wizard

05:05.806 --> 05:10.542
certainly won't mend fences or
rebuild moat bridges!

05:10.544 --> 05:13.345
How about
Emrick the Psychotic Sage?

05:13.347 --> 05:15.580
Can we call him
a psychotic sage?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.182
No, Tinkertoes!

05:17.184 --> 05:21.286
You may not refer to Emrick
as a psychotic anything!

05:21.288 --> 05:24.323
But, he's totally nuts!

05:24.325 --> 05:25.324
Bonkers!

05:25.326 --> 05:27.726
Cuckoo for Dragon's Fire Puffs!

05:27.728 --> 05:31.997
To be sure, he's done despicable
deeds in the past!

05:31.999 --> 05:35.200
But, that's neither
here nor there!

05:35.202 --> 05:37.602
Well, if it's all the same
to you, King Bedwyr,

05:37.604 --> 05:40.439
I'd rather Emrick be
there, and not here!

05:40.441 --> 05:41.873
Me, too!

05:41.875 --> 05:44.343
I can't think of anything
less appealing

05:44.345 --> 05:46.545
than inviting Emrick
to our annual

05:46.547 --> 05:48.513
Wee Thanksgiving celebration!

05:48.515 --> 05:51.283
I'm sorry you feel
this way, wees...

05:51.285 --> 05:56.488
because I plan to extend an
olive branch to that

05:56.490 --> 05:58.457
cantankerous old coot,

05:58.459 --> 06:03.028
welcoming him to join
us in feast and fun,

06:03.030 --> 06:07.432
as an honest peace
offering, from us to him!

06:07.434 --> 06:11.036
Wow...I don't even
know what to say!

06:11.038 --> 06:12.537
Say you'll accept!

06:12.539 --> 06:18.577
And stand with our kingdom,
in letting bygones be bygones!

06:18.579 --> 06:20.979
What say you, wees?!

06:20.981 --> 06:23.548
What'd I tell you, Big Gurt?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.450
The early wee catches the worm!

06:25.452 --> 06:27.986
Yeah, but you didn't
tell me we had to get

06:27.988 --> 06:29.454
up before sunrise
to do it, Boil!

06:29.456 --> 06:31.773
Talk about early!

06:31.774 --> 06:34.091
Look at it this way - that worm
was thrilled with the new garden

06:34.094 --> 06:36.495
we planted for him outside
the kingdom walls

06:36.497 --> 06:39.197
so he won't bore holes
in all the fruit and veggies

06:39.199 --> 06:40.665
in our garden anymore!

06:40.667 --> 06:42.167
Which means more to eat for us!

06:42.169 --> 06:43.502
That's right, big guy!

06:43.504 --> 06:46.271
Uh...Big Gurt...
my name's Big Gurt.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.873
Yes, I know, Gurt.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.909
Big guy's just a figure of
speech...y'know,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.411
like buddy, or pal!

06:52.413 --> 06:54.346
Oh...right!
I knew that!

06:54.348 --> 06:56.114
Hey, I see Gurgle up ahead!

06:56.116 --> 06:58.917
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he wants something!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.520
On second thought, it's Gurgle!

07:01.522 --> 07:02.988
He definitely wants something!

07:02.990 --> 07:04.673
Psssht!

07:04.674 --> 07:06.357
He's probably just looking to
spread more gossip!

07:06.360 --> 07:09.294
I swear, no wee flaps their jaws
as much as Gurgle does!

07:09.296 --> 07:10.295
You have a point!

07:10.297 --> 07:12.431
C'mon, let's see what he wants!

07:16.303 --> 07:19.004
Boil! Big Gurt!

07:19.006 --> 07:21.506
I've been looking
everywhere for ya!

07:21.508 --> 07:22.741
How come, Gurgle?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.376
Yeah, what's going on?

07:24.378 --> 07:26.044
Are you spreading a new rumor?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.946
Spreading a rumor?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.549
What do you wee
blokes take me for?

07:30.551 --> 07:32.150
A gossiper?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.218
Well...

07:33.554 --> 07:35.471
(both)
Yes!

07:35.472 --> 07:37.389
Hey, I can't help it if
I'm on the front lines

07:37.391 --> 07:39.524
of breaking news
round here!

07:39.526 --> 07:41.226
Some wee's gotta
sound the trumpet!

07:41.228 --> 07:42.594
You play trumpet?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.962
So do I!

07:43.964 --> 07:46.531
We should get together
sometime and jam!

07:46.533 --> 07:48.733
I think he means
figuratively, Gurt.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.836
Oh...another one of those
figures of speech?

07:50.838 --> 07:51.837
Yep.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.838
Dang!

07:52.840 --> 07:54.406
I gotta get the hang of those!

07:54.408 --> 07:57.409
Listen, the king's
looking for you two!

07:57.411 --> 07:58.811
King Bedwyr?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.212
Is there another king
I don't know about?

08:00.214 --> 08:01.830
Wait, wait!

08:01.831 --> 08:03.447
This is another figure of
speech, isn't it?!

08:03.450 --> 08:05.917
Not this time, Big Gurt!

08:05.919 --> 08:09.421
King Bedwyr asks that you wees

08:09.423 --> 08:11.256
report to his
castle court at once!

08:11.258 --> 08:13.458
Oh, no!

08:13.459 --> 08:15.659
Only bad wees get called to the
castle in-person!

08:15.662 --> 08:17.596
Not necessarily, Gurt!

08:17.597 --> 08:19.531
Sometimes, the king just wants
to make an announcement,

08:19.533 --> 08:21.533
- or issue an order!
- An order!

08:21.535 --> 08:23.401
What could King Bedwyr
possibly order us to do?

08:23.403 --> 08:26.771
Didn't he order you to do
community service
last month?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.773
Keep your voice down, Gurgle!

08:28.775 --> 08:30.775
I don't want every wee
finding out about that!

08:30.777 --> 08:33.411
Like the sight of you picking up
litter in the kingdom streets,

08:33.413 --> 08:37.148
while wearing that bright yellow
vest went unnoticed.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.149
Ha!

08:38.151 --> 08:41.686
Yeah, that vest
was as big as a tent!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.588
Hey, that's what they gave me!

08:43.590 --> 08:46.491
Besides, the last wee that was
sentenced to community service

08:46.493 --> 08:48.527
and didn't wear an
official kingdom vest

08:48.529 --> 08:49.928
got plucked right out of the

08:49.930 --> 08:52.464
town square by a giant
traptalericon, remember?

08:52.466 --> 08:54.032
Yep! Teemu the Turtle!

08:54.034 --> 08:56.535
It mistook him for a
Wee Widget Wobbler

08:56.537 --> 08:57.202
and snapped
him right up!

08:57.204 --> 08:58.737
We never saw Teemu again!

08:58.739 --> 09:00.639
Who knows what became of him!

09:00.641 --> 09:03.592
Oh, I do!

09:03.593 --> 09:06.544
That traptalericon got spooked
over the Waldengreen
Woods and dropped him!

09:06.547 --> 09:09.748
He used the tree
cover to get away!

09:09.750 --> 09:14.719
Now, he directs air traffic out
in the Kingdom of Willow Wisps!

09:14.721 --> 09:15.820
He does?!

09:15.822 --> 09:17.155
Why doesn't he come home?

09:17.157 --> 09:20.792
He tried - but he's a turtle!

09:20.794 --> 09:24.863
He walked for a year-and-a-half,
and only made it thirty feet!

09:24.865 --> 09:29.668
He finally said heck with it,
and got himself a job!

09:29.670 --> 09:32.470
He now has ten
little turtles of his own!

09:32.472 --> 09:33.471
Wow!

09:33.473 --> 09:34.472
Ten children!

09:34.474 --> 09:37.108
I didn't say they
were his children!

09:37.110 --> 09:40.445
He manages a
staff of ten turtles!

09:40.447 --> 09:45.317
Those Willow Wisps fly fast
and furious out there!

09:45.319 --> 09:48.520
Teemu needs all
the help he can get!

09:48.522 --> 09:49.521
Sounds like it!

09:49.523 --> 09:51.122
They pay him well, though!

09:51.124 --> 09:54.259
He drives a new catapult
car and everything!

09:54.261 --> 09:55.260
Gnarly!

09:55.262 --> 09:57.262
Now I'm curious, Gurt!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.563
Let's go see what
King Bedwyr wants!

09:58.565 --> 10:00.132
Okay!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.700
Hopefully, he doesn't have a
yellow vest waiting for me!

10:01.702 --> 10:05.937
If he does, let's at least hope
it's the right size!

10:05.939 --> 10:07.305
Pfft!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.242
Boil!

10:11.244 --> 10:12.544
Big Gurt!

10:12.546 --> 10:16.448
Thank you both for coming
on such short notice!

10:16.450 --> 10:19.784
Anytime we're summoned to the
castle is an honor, King Bedwyr!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.953
Except that time you put me in a
bright yellow vest and made me

10:21.955 --> 10:23.989
clean up the kingdom!
That was a shame!

10:23.991 --> 10:29.561
Well, it was either that or
thirty days in
the wee dungeon, Big Gurt!

10:29.563 --> 10:34.966
Given your age, I thought it
best to mete
out constructive punishment!

10:34.968 --> 10:40.572
Lo and behold, you haven't found
yourself in trouble since!

10:40.574 --> 10:44.109
That is true, Gurt!

10:44.110 --> 10:47.645
If I may ask, Big Gurt, what
exactly did you do to deserve
kingdom community service?

10:47.648 --> 10:51.316
Oh, uh...I, um...

10:51.318 --> 10:54.185
He put on a fake mustache
made of woolly wombat fur,

10:54.187 --> 10:56.087
told the school cafeteria
chefs he was

10:56.089 --> 10:58.023
from the nutrition
inspector's office,

10:58.025 --> 11:00.091
and that they needed to
prepare all the desserts

11:00.093 --> 11:04.729
on the menu, so he could sample
them for kingdom
testing and grading.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.064
Uh...hehe...

11:07.300 --> 11:10.902
Wow! That's pretty
elaborate for a wee dragon!

11:10.904 --> 11:12.537
How'd you get caught?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.239
Uh, well...

11:14.241 --> 11:17.909
He left a trail of cupcake
crumbs leading
right back to his den.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.996
Oh.

11:20.997 --> 11:24.082
A detail that proved
to be his undoing.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.083
Clearly!

11:25.085 --> 11:27.018
I did what I said I was
gonna do, though!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.554
I tasted and graded
everything they gave me!

11:29.556 --> 11:31.956
And you had a
bellyache for a week!

11:31.958 --> 11:35.794
Rigors of the profession, Boil!
Rigors of the profession!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.829
(all laugh)

11:40.567 --> 11:45.236
Youthful and foolhardy
schemes aside,

11:45.238 --> 11:49.874
I knew that once Little Gurt -
as he was known back then -

11:49.876 --> 11:53.344
matured and settled down,

11:53.346 --> 11:59.150
he'd make a fine dragon in our
Wee Kingdom one day!

11:59.152 --> 12:04.489
And, dare I say,
that day's arrived!

12:04.491 --> 12:07.959
So...I'm not being
punished for something?

12:07.961 --> 12:11.129
Have you done something wrong?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.564
Umm...

12:12.566 --> 12:14.599
Go no further!

12:14.601 --> 12:17.669
I don't wish to know!

12:17.671 --> 12:18.670
Whew!

12:18.672 --> 12:19.671
Boil.

12:19.673 --> 12:23.809
Big Gurt.

12:23.810 --> 12:27.946
The reason I've brought you here
today, is because our kingdom
needs your help!

12:27.948 --> 12:29.815
Oh!

12:29.816 --> 12:31.683
I still have that woolly wombat
mustache, if you--

12:31.685 --> 12:34.018
Shh! Not a good idea, Gurt.

12:34.020 --> 12:38.039
Oh...right.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.059
At first, I thought this task
would be ideal
for Cai and Tinkertoes!

12:42.062 --> 12:49.100
But, after Cai explained her
understandable fears,

12:49.102 --> 12:54.205
we decided to approach
you two wees!

12:54.207 --> 12:56.407
I'm not sure how comfortable I
am with it...

12:56.409 --> 12:58.343
and Tinkertoes has never been
on a grown-up mission!

12:58.345 --> 12:59.344
Sounds good!

12:59.346 --> 13:01.346
We're in!

13:01.348 --> 13:04.482
But, you don't even
know what it is yet!

13:04.484 --> 13:06.484
Psssht! Details, schmetails!

13:06.486 --> 13:09.988
If a thing needs doing, and it
needs doing
right, call Big Gurt and Boil!

13:09.990 --> 13:12.891
Wee Dragons extraordinaire!

13:12.893 --> 13:18.363
Do you two remember that ornery,
old Emrick the Wizard?

13:18.365 --> 13:19.364
Do we?!

13:19.366 --> 13:20.832
We'll never forget!

13:20.834 --> 13:23.868
Oh...this is an Emrick thing?

13:23.870 --> 13:26.704
I just remembered I'm going out
of town this week.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.207
Out of town?

13:29.208 --> 13:31.709
You've never ventured out of
eyeshot of the kingdom's gates!

13:31.711 --> 13:34.112
Could you just play along, Boil?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.281
I don't want to fight with that
old wizard again!

13:36.283 --> 13:39.517
Oh, you won't be fighting, wees!

13:39.519 --> 13:45.256
You'll be inviting Emrick to our
Wee Thanksgiving dinner!

13:45.258 --> 13:46.791
Inviting?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.326
Emrick?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.762
Are we talking
about the same wizard?

13:50.764 --> 13:54.465
We are, indeed!

13:54.467 --> 13:58.703
I know you two wees share a
grudging respect with that old

13:58.705 --> 14:05.410
troublemaker...and as one of
my first decrees as king,

14:05.412 --> 14:10.782
I'd like to bury the hatchet
with him once and for all!

14:10.784 --> 14:13.718
But, Emrick's a trickster!

14:13.720 --> 14:14.719
A charlatan!

14:14.721 --> 14:16.321
He's conniving!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.322
Devious!

14:17.324 --> 14:22.026
I'm aware, Big Gurt,
I'm aware...

14:22.028 --> 14:27.031
I've spoken with Emrick in my
dreams, and he assures

14:27.033 --> 14:33.271
me he also wishes
to forge a truce!

14:33.273 --> 14:34.439
In your dreams?!

14:34.441 --> 14:36.608
But that's his dark magic, king!

14:36.610 --> 14:38.142
He's luring you!

14:38.144 --> 14:39.143
Yeah!

14:39.145 --> 14:41.079
No way we can trust him!

14:41.081 --> 14:42.080
Nonsense!

14:42.082 --> 14:45.149
If an enemy says he
wishes to find peace,

14:45.151 --> 14:50.755
it is my duty as Wee King to
make every effort to oblige -

14:50.757 --> 14:54.292
not only for the
good of Wee Dragons,

14:54.294 --> 14:56.327
but for all creatures
everywhere!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.529
It's settled then!

14:58.531 --> 15:01.332
You'll leave on the morrow!

15:01.334 --> 15:03.968
I thank you, wees!

15:03.970 --> 15:08.206
And your kingdom thanks you!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.315
Hiya, Durwyn!

15:17.317 --> 15:19.217
Who goes there?!

15:19.219 --> 15:23.354
Who dares disturb
Durwyn's slumber?!

15:23.356 --> 15:24.555
Blister the Wee!

15:24.557 --> 15:28.293
A wee?!

15:28.294 --> 15:32.030
Any wee fool enough to trespass
in my lair is a wee appetizer!

15:32.032 --> 15:34.465
I-I'm aware of that!

15:34.467 --> 15:38.036
I have news I thought you might
be i-interested to hear, Durwyn!

15:38.038 --> 15:42.974
Unless it's a new recipe for wee
stew, don't bother!

15:42.976 --> 15:45.376
No, i-it's not wee stew!

15:45.378 --> 15:46.911
I thought not!

15:46.913 --> 15:48.713
Unlucky for you!

15:48.715 --> 15:53.451
Little wee, prepare to
meet your maker!

15:54.387 --> 15:55.954
First, let me say my piece!

15:55.956 --> 15:59.257
Then, you may do
with me as you see fit...

15:59.259 --> 16:02.260
unless you're really hungry for
wee stew...I mean,

16:02.262 --> 16:04.295
I'd prefer not to--

16:04.297 --> 16:06.497
Out with it!

16:06.499 --> 16:09.367
King Bedwyr has sent a
wee team to Emrick's castle!

16:09.369 --> 16:13.871
Hmm...Bedwyr is attacking
Emrick?!

16:13.873 --> 16:15.340
For no reason?!

16:15.342 --> 16:19.310
N-No, Durwyn, not
attacking...

16:19.312 --> 16:22.513
- he's offering a truce!
- A truce?!

16:22.916 --> 16:24.482
He wants peace!

16:24.484 --> 16:25.483
Peace?!

16:25.485 --> 16:26.818
That's what I said!

16:26.820 --> 16:28.553
Interesting, isn't it?

16:28.555 --> 16:31.956
That's one word to describe it!

16:31.958 --> 16:35.059
So, what does this
mean for my exile?

16:35.061 --> 16:36.461
I was cast out!

16:36.463 --> 16:39.714
Forgotten!

16:39.715 --> 16:42.966
I've been banished for ages,
through no fault of my own!

16:42.969 --> 16:45.236
I-I know, right?

16:45.237 --> 16:47.504
You're the first dragon I
thought of, as
soon as I heard the news!

16:47.507 --> 16:52.810
Yes, I breathed fire in the
kingdom's populated area!

16:52.812 --> 16:53.878
And yes,

16:53.880 --> 16:57.148
I accidentally burned down
Maribel's hut!

16:57.150 --> 17:00.385
But, I could hardly be blamed!

17:00.387 --> 17:03.087
My mind wasn't my own!

17:03.089 --> 17:11.095
I was under a savage spell, cast
by that mad old warlock himself!

17:11.097 --> 17:14.599
Y-You don't have to explain
yourself to me, Durwyn!

17:14.601 --> 17:16.801
I was your biggest champion!

17:16.803 --> 17:21.005
I argued for days over
you being sent away!

17:21.007 --> 17:24.709
What about Durwyn's wee
piggyback rides, I said!

17:24.711 --> 17:29.213
What about the fireworks
straight from his
belly on the 4th of Wee-ly!

17:29.215 --> 17:35.453
I proposed a stern warning with
forgiveness...but
no wee would listen!

17:35.455 --> 17:36.854
They wanted punishment!

17:36.856 --> 17:41.059
They wanted banishment,
is what they wanted!

17:41.061 --> 17:43.127
And they got it!

17:43.129 --> 17:46.531
All because you fell under the
spell of a powerful wizard

17:46.533 --> 17:49.167
with a chip on
his shoulder!

17:49.169 --> 17:53.337
Mmm, yes...powerful, indeed!

17:53.339 --> 17:59.811
I miss the unbridled power that
was bestowed
unto me by that old man!

17:59.813 --> 18:02.680
The strength! The speed!

18:02.682 --> 18:05.716
The fire breathing fury!

18:05.718 --> 18:08.853
Believe it or not,
Durwyn...so do I!

18:08.855 --> 18:11.622
What's your deal, wee?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.724
Are you mad?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.725
Mad?

18:14.727 --> 18:15.726
Nah!

18:15.728 --> 18:17.728
The wees don't
take me seriously!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.530
They just think I'm a goof!

18:19.532 --> 18:22.200
They may have a point!

18:22.202 --> 18:24.202
What are you getting at?!

18:24.204 --> 18:28.539
Oh...I-I, uh...I want to offer
you vengeance, Durwyn!

18:28.541 --> 18:30.708
Vengeance?!

18:30.710 --> 18:33.077
I want to help you get
back at King Bedwyr

18:33.079 --> 18:35.847
for casting you out,
when all you did was

18:35.849 --> 18:38.950
get your mind taken
over by a magic spell!

18:38.952 --> 18:40.785
That's true!

18:40.787 --> 18:45.056
I could've reduced the Wee
Kingdom to ash
anytime I wanted to!

18:45.058 --> 18:49.894
But, all my life
I was a docile dragon!

18:49.896 --> 18:51.362
Yeah, well...NO MORE!

18:51.364 --> 18:55.133
That's easy for
you to say, runt!

18:55.135 --> 18:58.402
You're not banished
from your kingdom!

18:58.404 --> 19:05.409
I, on the other foot, am
prevented from returning
by hybrid magic!

19:05.411 --> 19:10.348
I may not flap a wing inside
the kingdom's walls,

19:10.350 --> 19:14.218
without being shrunk
to wee size!

19:14.220 --> 19:17.755
I'd rather stay here,
forever alone,

19:17.757 --> 19:22.260
than forfeit my dragon might!

19:22.262 --> 19:26.931
All I have left is my fearsome
reputation, you know?!

19:26.933 --> 19:30.902
Well, Durwyn, my friend...
what if I told you

19:30.904 --> 19:34.805
there was a way
around that little detail?

19:38.444 --> 19:41.112
Maybe Cai and Tinkertoes can
talk some sense into

19:41.114 --> 19:43.481
King Bedwyr before we get
to the castle,

19:43.483 --> 19:45.249
and he'll call this
whole thing off!

19:45.251 --> 19:48.853
Yeah, maybe...or maybe this
whole thing is a trap

19:48.855 --> 19:50.788
with a lot of players and
moving parts,

19:50.790 --> 19:53.090
and it's too late
to turn it around!

19:53.092 --> 19:56.594
If that's the case,
Boil...what do we do?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.863
There's nothing we can do until
we know what's going on!

19:58.865 --> 20:01.465
'Til then, we'll keep our
eyes and ears open,

20:01.467 --> 20:02.500
and hope for the best!

20:02.502 --> 20:03.568
(gulps)

20:04.637 --> 20:07.638
Welcome back, girls!

20:07.640 --> 20:12.343
I trust that Boil and Big Gurt
are flying high in the sky,

20:12.345 --> 20:16.881
en route to Emrick's remote
castle in the mountains!

20:16.883 --> 20:20.351
I can't wait to
receive his reply!

20:20.353 --> 20:24.088
Why, I'm practically on
pins and needles!

20:24.090 --> 20:26.190
So are we!

20:26.192 --> 20:28.492
In the meantime,
all we can do is wait!

20:28.494 --> 20:30.328
How are you feeling,
King Bedwyr?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.464
I feel fantastic, Cai!

20:33.466 --> 20:35.066
Thank you for asking!

20:35.068 --> 20:36.367
No problem!

20:36.369 --> 20:39.237
A happy king makes
a happy kingdom!

20:39.239 --> 20:40.371
Yes, indeed!

20:40.373 --> 20:42.206
I like that saying!

20:42.208 --> 20:45.042
May I use it as my slogan,

20:45.044 --> 20:49.380
during our re-election
campaign?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.949
If you decide to
run again, sure!

20:51.951 --> 20:53.417
If I decide?

20:53.419 --> 20:57.188
I've already decided, Cai!

20:57.190 --> 21:01.826
And once the Wee Kingdom breaks
bread with our former enemy,

21:01.828 --> 21:03.794
Emrick the Wizard,

21:03.796 --> 21:10.768
I'll be the most popular king
to ever sit upon the wee throne!

21:10.770 --> 21:12.803
The champion of prosperity!

21:12.805 --> 21:14.939
The bringer of joy!

21:14.941 --> 21:18.676
The keeper of peace!

21:18.678 --> 21:22.046
Some wee's letting the
crown go to his head.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.048
(giggles)

21:24.050 --> 21:27.218
Eh? What's that?

21:27.220 --> 21:28.853
Did I miss something?

21:28.855 --> 21:30.921
No, King Bedwyr.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.523
I sneezed, is all.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.724
Seasonal allergies.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.692
Ah!

21:34.694 --> 21:36.994
Try some garlic!

21:36.996 --> 21:41.465
Natural remedies are
the most effective!

21:41.467 --> 21:42.233
Will do, king!

21:42.235 --> 21:43.567
Thanks for the tip!

21:43.569 --> 21:46.771
Or locally-sourced honey!

21:46.773 --> 21:52.743
Our wee Beatrice sells jars in
town at a fair price!

21:52.745 --> 21:56.580
- Okay!
- Or bone broth!

21:56.582 --> 21:59.583
See Scully in our
soup kitchen for that!

21:59.585 --> 22:01.085
Yummy!

22:01.087 --> 22:05.956
Anything wees need, wees have,

22:05.958 --> 22:08.793
right here
in our own kingdom, girls!

22:08.795 --> 22:13.030
There's no need for any wee to
ever venture forth into the

22:13.032 --> 22:16.067
wild and endanger
themselves,

22:16.069 --> 22:20.805
or their loved ones, ever again!

22:20.807 --> 22:23.874
And as soon as we
join forces with Emrick

22:23.876 --> 22:28.713
- transforming an old
enemy into a new friend

22:28.715 --> 22:33.284
- our Wee Kingdom shall
prosper forever!

22:33.286 --> 22:35.720
That sounds...fun?

22:35.722 --> 22:38.155
So, King Bedwyr...

22:38.157 --> 22:42.827
have you had any more of
those dreams lately?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.832
I can't believe we're doing
this, Big Gurt!

22:47.834 --> 22:50.801
Sometimes, I have to pinch
myself to make sure it's real!

22:50.803 --> 22:53.404
What if it's not?

22:53.405 --> 22:56.006
What if we're in a dream, inside
a spell, in another dimension?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.742
You just blew my mind a little!

22:57.744 --> 22:58.743
Yeah, mine too!

22:58.745 --> 23:00.244
But, what if?

23:00.246 --> 23:02.096
If that's the case,

23:02.097 --> 23:03.947
there's nothing we
can do about it anyway!

23:03.950 --> 23:07.318
We have no choice but to take
everything we
see and hear at face value!

23:07.320 --> 23:10.421
And be decisive and
committed in everything we do!

23:10.423 --> 23:13.424
Like inviting Emrick to our
Wee Thanksgiving celebration!

23:13.426 --> 23:14.959
Yeah...like that.

23:14.961 --> 23:15.960
It sounds weird!

23:15.962 --> 23:17.395
I can't get used to it!

23:17.397 --> 23:19.430
I can't wrap my head around it!

23:19.432 --> 23:21.332
What is it, King Bedwyr?

23:21.334 --> 23:22.967
Are Boil and Big Gurt okay?

23:22.969 --> 23:24.769
I've no idea!

23:24.771 --> 23:29.774
But our wee scouts have reported
that the mighty Durwyn

23:29.776 --> 23:32.143
is heading toward
our kingdom

23:32.145 --> 23:36.414
at a rate of speed
akin to wartime!

23:36.416 --> 23:37.715
(both)
Durwyn?

23:37.717 --> 23:40.518
I thought that big mean dragon
was banished forever!

23:40.520 --> 23:42.186
I thought he was dead!

23:42.188 --> 23:47.758
Yes, well, I'm afraid
neither holds true!

23:47.760 --> 23:53.030
Durwyn is very much alive,
and any magic spell

23:53.032 --> 23:55.733
banishment has certain
loopholes...

23:55.735 --> 23:58.335
he's obviously found one!

23:58.337 --> 24:01.572
Are we prepared to face the
mighty Durwyn, king?

24:01.574 --> 24:04.842
Can we assemble wee troops in
time to be ready for him?

24:04.844 --> 24:08.379
No...I'm afraid not, Cai!

24:08.381 --> 24:11.348
He's caught us
short handed, short-winged,

24:11.350 --> 24:14.785
flat-footed,
resting on our laurels!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.220
Oh, no!

24:16.222 --> 24:18.722
What will we do, king?!

24:18.724 --> 24:20.458
Don't worry, Tinkertoes!

24:20.460 --> 24:22.193
I'll handle it!

24:22.195 --> 24:25.162
But, Durwyn was banished
in the first place,

24:25.164 --> 24:28.399
so no wee would ever have to
handle it again!

24:28.401 --> 24:29.934
I'm aware of that!

24:29.936 --> 24:32.803
King Bedwyr, we can't just wait
for Durwyn to arrive!

24:32.805 --> 24:34.305
We have to do something!

24:34.307 --> 24:36.707
Whether he comes in peace or
not, we have to be ready!

24:36.709 --> 24:41.178
That's why I'm ordering you two
to vacate my castle at once!

24:41.180 --> 24:42.179
Vacate?

24:42.181 --> 24:43.414
And leave you here?

24:43.416 --> 24:44.582
Alone?

24:44.584 --> 24:45.749
Unarmed?

24:45.751 --> 24:49.487
I have all I need, Tinkertoes!

24:49.489 --> 24:52.490
I know Durwyn well!

24:52.492 --> 24:55.759
But you precious wees
must run far away!

24:55.761 --> 25:00.898
Find the most remote land you
can reach, and hide there!

25:00.900 --> 25:02.433
Run and hide?

25:02.435 --> 25:04.602
But, what about you?
What about the Wee Kingdom?

25:04.604 --> 25:09.139
I took a solemn oath to
honor and defend the

25:09.141 --> 25:14.445
Wee Kingdom to my
last breath, and I shall!

25:14.447 --> 25:17.648
But, kings are overthrown
all the time!

25:17.650 --> 25:20.117
If you're left unguarded and
taken from us--

25:20.119 --> 25:21.352
Enough, Tinkertoes!

25:21.354 --> 25:23.153
I'm the Wee King!

25:23.155 --> 25:29.460
If the throne is to fall,
I will gladly fall with it!

25:29.462 --> 25:32.446
(both)
Gladly?

25:32.447 --> 25:35.431
Well, not gladly,
but--you get the idea!

25:35.434 --> 25:38.068
There's no time to delay!

25:38.070 --> 25:39.436
Away with you both!

25:39.438 --> 25:42.373
But...how will we know
when it's safe to return?

25:42.375 --> 25:43.541
Or not?

25:43.543 --> 25:48.379
I suppose if things go
poorly, and our kingdom

25:48.381 --> 25:51.248
falls under siege,
you'll see the black

25:51.250 --> 25:54.385
smoke filling the
sky for miles around!

25:54.387 --> 25:56.453
I never want to see that!

25:56.455 --> 25:57.454
Never, ever!

25:57.456 --> 25:59.890
I don't even want
to think about it!

25:59.892 --> 26:01.592
But we must!

26:01.594 --> 26:03.193
Welcome to my world!

26:03.195 --> 26:06.297
Running a kingdom ain't easy!

26:06.299 --> 26:10.834
Come, I'll send you two out
through the tunnels!

26:10.836 --> 26:13.971
When you reach the
countryside, run, fly,

26:13.973 --> 26:17.007
hitch a ride on a
traptalericon if you have

26:17.009 --> 26:18.042
to!

26:18.044 --> 26:22.913
Just get yourselves
far away and wait!

26:22.915 --> 26:26.784
I'll signal when all is well!

26:26.786 --> 26:27.851
What will the signal be?

26:27.853 --> 26:29.920
I've no clue!

26:30.523 --> 26:32.590
(music plays)

26:32.858 --> 26:35.859
When we get there, all we have
to do is keep it simple!

26:35.861 --> 26:38.996
It's important to listen
very closely to Emrick,

26:38.998 --> 26:41.799
to everything he says,
no matter how offhand it seems!

26:41.801 --> 26:44.001
Even if he's nice to us?

26:44.003 --> 26:47.504
Even if he's a singing, dancing,
jolly old wizard?

26:47.506 --> 26:49.673
Even if he's sweet as pie?

26:49.675 --> 26:51.275
Especially if he's sweet as pie!

26:51.277 --> 26:54.478
Emrick has a knack for running
his mouth too much!

26:54.480 --> 26:58.349
He gives most of his schemes
away with his
crazy braggadocio!

26:58.351 --> 27:00.451
Braggadocio...is that a pie?

27:00.453 --> 27:04.221
What? No, it's not a pie!

27:04.223 --> 27:05.856
It means, like, arrogance!

27:05.858 --> 27:08.726
Oh...'cause it
sounds like a pie!

27:08.728 --> 27:10.561
Maybe you're just hungry.

27:10.563 --> 27:13.564
I am! You wanna stop
and have some pie?!

27:13.566 --> 27:14.298
Where?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.400
We're in the middle
of nowhere, Gurt!

27:16.402 --> 27:17.768
This is Mubblegunk country!

27:17.770 --> 27:19.603
There is no pie!

27:19.605 --> 27:22.740
They don't eat pie
in Mubblegunk country?

27:22.742 --> 27:23.741
No!

27:23.743 --> 27:24.742
Haven't you heard?

27:24.744 --> 27:26.610
They don't have
anything modern here!

27:26.612 --> 27:28.712
They're like cave wees!

27:28.714 --> 27:31.148
They grunt communication!

27:31.150 --> 27:32.549
Scratch messages on rocks!

27:32.551 --> 27:33.784
Oh, wow!

27:33.786 --> 27:35.152
I had no idea!

27:35.154 --> 27:36.720
Well, now you know!

27:36.722 --> 27:39.923
There's no reason to ever spend
time in these remote parts!

27:39.925 --> 27:42.860
We're just too
sophisticated for them!

27:42.862 --> 27:45.262
We're real lucky to
be born wee dragons!

27:45.264 --> 27:46.797
That we are, Gurt!

27:46.799 --> 27:48.265
That we are!

27:48.267 --> 27:52.369
Hey, if they don't know about
pie, I bet some wee dragon

27:52.371 --> 27:54.672
could make a fortune by
opening a bakery down here!

27:54.674 --> 27:55.673
Maybe!

27:55.675 --> 27:57.408
Let's stay focused on the
mission, Gurt!

27:57.410 --> 27:58.442
Right, right!

27:58.444 --> 28:00.811
You ever think of opening a
bakery, Boil?

28:00.813 --> 28:01.812
No!

28:01.814 --> 28:03.814
No, I haven't!

28:03.816 --> 28:05.949
I'm not big on pastries!

28:05.951 --> 28:07.618
You're not?!

28:07.620 --> 28:09.353
But, they're scrumptious!

28:09.588 --> 28:11.655
(music plays)

28:12.858 --> 28:16.694
Greetings, oh,
powerful Wee King!

28:16.696 --> 28:22.299
Your reputation for ruling with
a fair and balanced claw

28:22.301 --> 28:23.767
precedes you!

28:23.769 --> 28:28.672
Compliments on your
quaint and cozy kingdom!

28:28.674 --> 28:29.673
Durwyn!

28:29.675 --> 28:31.442
You've returned!

28:31.444 --> 28:33.911
Oh, you remember me!

28:33.913 --> 28:34.912
Excellent!

28:34.914 --> 28:39.483
It will make this transition
much easier!

28:39.485 --> 28:43.387
Transition?
What transition?

28:43.389 --> 28:46.256
If you want my kingdom, Durwyn,

28:46.258 --> 28:50.994
you'll have
to pry it from my cold claws!

28:50.996 --> 28:55.699
I was hoping you'd
say that, Bedwyr!

28:55.701 --> 29:02.306
I've been looking forward to
this day for a long, long time!

29:02.308 --> 29:05.676
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you!

29:05.678 --> 29:09.513
I'm afraid it's going to be
quite a letdown!

29:09.515 --> 29:12.015
I'm not going anywhere!

29:12.017 --> 29:13.283
No?!

29:13.285 --> 29:17.755
Then prepare to fall
with your castle, wee!

29:17.757 --> 29:19.823
Better listen to him, king!

29:19.825 --> 29:21.792
He's not fooling around!

29:21.794 --> 29:25.246
Nor am I!

29:25.247 --> 29:28.699
Bedwyr, it makes no difference
to me if I assume your crown

29:28.701 --> 29:33.570
peacefully, or reduce this
whole kingdom to ash!

29:33.572 --> 29:40.711
This land will fall under my
rule, one way or another!

29:40.713 --> 29:42.913
Blister, why?!

29:42.915 --> 29:45.682
How could you do
this to your own wees?

29:45.684 --> 29:47.684
Your homeland?

29:47.686 --> 29:50.053
I'm tired of being
overlooked, king!

29:50.055 --> 29:52.022
Me and Gurgle both!

29:52.024 --> 29:55.492
We're worthy of prominent
positions in the king's court!

29:55.494 --> 29:57.227
But, what are we?

29:57.229 --> 29:58.262
Messengers!

29:58.264 --> 29:59.263
Gophers!

29:59.265 --> 30:00.297
Lackeys!

30:00.299 --> 30:01.298
No more!

30:01.300 --> 30:04.434
It's time for a change!

30:04.436 --> 30:10.007
And a real monarch
on the throne!

30:10.009 --> 30:13.911
Just how do you intend to win
over the Wee Dragons?

30:13.913 --> 30:15.779
They remember you!

30:15.781 --> 30:18.015
They despise you!

30:18.017 --> 30:20.284
They'll never follow you!

30:20.286 --> 30:22.820
That's no way to
address the new king!

30:22.822 --> 30:24.254
Mind your tongue, wee!

30:24.256 --> 30:28.692
Loyal subjects concern me not!

30:28.694 --> 30:32.296
The Wee Kingdom, as you know it,
is finished, Bedwyr!

30:32.298 --> 30:35.799
It's long been a joke!

30:35.801 --> 30:41.738
Like a cheap dollhouse in the
backyard of a sprawling estate,

30:41.740 --> 30:46.610
relying on leftovers from the
kitchen to survive!

30:46.612 --> 30:53.016
In MY kingdom,
the rules will be rewritten!

30:53.018 --> 30:59.756
In MY kingdom, the wee image
will be overhauled!

30:59.758 --> 31:06.063
In MY kingdom,
only the strong survive!

31:06.065 --> 31:07.631
And the funny!

31:07.633 --> 31:08.632
What?!

31:08.634 --> 31:09.633
The funny!

31:09.635 --> 31:12.736
Every wee needs a
good laugh now and then,

31:12.738 --> 31:13.937
and I got lotsa good jokes!

31:13.939 --> 31:17.474
I've always wanted to
entertain in the king's court...

31:17.476 --> 31:20.210
y'know, warm-up the crowds
before the king's address!

31:20.212 --> 31:21.545
Fine, Blister!

31:21.547 --> 31:28.685
Whatever will shut you up--I
mean...make you happy!

31:28.687 --> 31:29.686
Ha! See?

31:29.688 --> 31:32.322
How difficult was that, Bedwyr?

31:32.324 --> 31:37.060
Throw a wee a bone once in a
while, and they
could fashion a scepter!

31:37.062 --> 31:41.865
But keep the scraps for
yourself, all you'll
receive is scorn!

31:41.867 --> 31:43.834
Stop this madness, Blister!

31:43.836 --> 31:45.702
It's not too late!

31:45.704 --> 31:48.272
On the contrary, king!

31:48.274 --> 31:50.841
It's far too late!

31:50.843 --> 31:56.847
The mighty Durwyn is back!
And I'm back to stay!

31:56.849 --> 32:02.219
There's only room for one king
on the throne, Bedwyr!

32:02.221 --> 32:04.821
And you're looking at him!

32:04.823 --> 32:06.990
That's strange.

32:06.992 --> 32:12.729
This mirror makes me look
like a mighty dragon,

32:12.731 --> 32:15.666
and an ugly one at that!

32:15.668 --> 32:17.167
That's funny.

32:17.169 --> 32:21.872
I mean...button your maw,
Bedwyr.

32:21.874 --> 32:27.844
Now is your chance to fill
me in on the fine details

32:27.846 --> 32:31.882
and inner workings of
your day, Bedwyr!

32:31.884 --> 32:37.888
Every kingdom marches to the
beat of its own drum, and I do

32:37.890 --> 32:42.292
wish to make this as seamless
a transition as possible!

32:42.294 --> 32:47.297
Many wees won't even
know they have a new ruler,

32:47.299 --> 32:51.501
until the monthly
king's address!

32:51.503 --> 32:54.154
(laughs)

32:54.155 --> 32:56.806
And what if I tell you
everything, Durwyn?

32:56.809 --> 32:58.475
What then?

32:58.477 --> 33:03.914
Then, you can begin serving your
sentence without delay!

33:03.916 --> 33:05.482
My sentence?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.384
Yes, Bedwyr!

33:07.386 --> 33:13.523
You see, where I once was,
you soon shall be!

33:13.525 --> 33:15.592
(maniacal laugh)

33:23.802 --> 33:24.868
Well, well!

33:24.870 --> 33:26.470
Look who we have here!

33:26.472 --> 33:30.207
Two Wee Dragons, far from home!

33:30.209 --> 33:32.509
What brings you to me, wees?

33:32.511 --> 33:33.877
What makes you roam?

33:33.879 --> 33:35.912
I'm glad you asked, Emrick!

33:35.914 --> 33:37.848
We have an offer for you!

33:37.850 --> 33:38.849
An offer?

33:38.851 --> 33:40.917
For little old me?

33:40.919 --> 33:43.453
Make me your pitch, wees,
and then we'll see!

33:43.455 --> 33:45.222
Did he always rhyme like this?

33:45.224 --> 33:46.823
I don't think so.

33:46.825 --> 33:49.626
He might be going senile!

33:49.628 --> 33:50.794
He sure looks old!

33:50.796 --> 33:53.930
Emrick, under orders
of our king,

33:53.932 --> 33:56.633
we'd like to officially invite
you to attend our

33:56.635 --> 33:59.636
Wee Kingdom Thanksgiving
celebration!

33:59.638 --> 34:01.304
Tee-hee!
Tee-hee!

34:01.306 --> 34:03.173
You traversed mountain and sea!

34:03.175 --> 34:06.510
All for a personal invite to me?

34:06.512 --> 34:08.111
That's right!

34:08.113 --> 34:10.781
King Bedwyr mentioned that
he communicated with you

34:10.783 --> 34:13.817
in his dreams, and that you'd be
receptive to our visit!

34:13.819 --> 34:16.620
Expected is one thing,
receptive another!

34:16.622 --> 34:19.423
Tell me, who's this wee lad?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.191
Is he your brother?

34:21.193 --> 34:22.959
This is my best
friend, Big Gurt!

34:22.961 --> 34:23.960
Big Gurt, you say!

34:23.962 --> 34:26.563
A name like none else!

34:26.565 --> 34:31.268
Tell me, have you come in
support, all this
way to my house?

34:31.270 --> 34:34.838
Uh...I go where my
buddy, Boil, goes!

34:34.840 --> 34:38.508
And our king asked us to deliver
this message to you, in person!

34:38.510 --> 34:42.179
The king asked, so his
orders you followed!

34:42.181 --> 34:45.715
His word is your law, his will
to be followed!

34:45.717 --> 34:47.150
Yeah...something like that.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.119
Do you always talk like this?

34:49.121 --> 34:50.887
Like what, naive wee?

34:50.889 --> 34:53.023
Like a sing-songing sage?

34:53.025 --> 34:55.892
Like a witty wise wordsmith,
in spite of my age?

34:55.894 --> 34:59.663
More like a wizardy rapper
in a big pointy hat!

34:59.665 --> 35:03.500
Playing fancy word games,
while your message falls flat!

35:03.502 --> 35:04.501
- Buh!
- Gurt!

35:04.503 --> 35:05.502
What?

35:05.504 --> 35:06.503
He's talking gibberish!

35:06.505 --> 35:08.371
We invited him
like we were told,

35:08.373 --> 35:10.173
now what do you say we
go scout locations for that

35:10.175 --> 35:11.575
bakery we talked about?

35:11.577 --> 35:13.844
A wee bakery, yes!

35:13.846 --> 35:15.479
Sweet crepes on a dish!

35:15.481 --> 35:16.847
I can make it come true!

35:16.849 --> 35:18.782
I can grant you that wish!

35:18.784 --> 35:19.783
You can?

35:19.785 --> 35:21.618
Don't fall for it, Gurt!

35:21.620 --> 35:23.053
It's a ploy!

35:23.055 --> 35:24.054
It is?

35:24.056 --> 35:25.939
Yes!

35:25.940 --> 35:27.823
You really think old Emrick
would grant us anything

35:27.826 --> 35:29.392
out of the kindness
of his heart?

35:29.394 --> 35:31.528
I can and I will, wee!

35:31.530 --> 35:35.265
Some dreams you may keep...
or shall I make them real,

35:35.267 --> 35:37.267
behind eyelids
as you sleep?

35:37.269 --> 35:38.268
See?!

35:38.270 --> 35:40.337
He's working magic on us, Gurt!

35:40.339 --> 35:42.739
Just like he's been doing to
King Bedwyr!

35:42.741 --> 35:43.974
King Bedwyr!

35:43.976 --> 35:45.242
Tee-hee!

35:45.244 --> 35:46.443
So noble and brave!

35:46.445 --> 35:50.080
One day a ruler,
the next day a slave!

35:50.082 --> 35:51.081
What?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.415
What's that supposed to mean?

35:52.417 --> 35:55.752
It means I have eyes
and ears in the dark!

35:55.754 --> 35:58.622
And my magic intentions
always hit their mark!

35:58.624 --> 36:00.390
Well, we are the wees!

36:00.392 --> 36:02.792
And we don't take no guff!

36:02.794 --> 36:06.029
So stop with your rhyming,
or else we'll get rough!

36:06.031 --> 36:07.030
Gurt--

36:07.032 --> 36:09.666
Is that so, dim-lit wee?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.434
You dare challenge me?!

36:11.436 --> 36:16.606
I have barbs you won't see and
reach you can't flee!

36:16.608 --> 36:19.042
Is that what you've been
practicing on our
king, Emrick?

36:19.044 --> 36:22.012
By coming to him
at night, in his dreams?

36:22.014 --> 36:25.515
Convincing him you care about
peace, when
we all know you only want war?

36:25.517 --> 36:28.318
Oh, but you've got me all wrong!

36:28.320 --> 36:32.088
I want your land to prosper,
grow steadfast and strong!

36:32.090 --> 36:34.224
I've heard enough of this
wizard's garbage!

36:34.226 --> 36:35.225
Let's go, Boil!

36:35.227 --> 36:37.027
All we're doing is
entertaining him!

36:37.029 --> 36:39.963
But, the real entertainment is
in your king's sanctum!

36:39.965 --> 36:44.601
Where an foe older than I now
rules your Wee Kingdom!

36:47.573 --> 36:49.139
I'm worried, Tinkertoes!

36:49.141 --> 36:50.307
About King Bedwyr?

36:50.309 --> 36:52.075
King Bedwyr,
and everything else!

36:52.077 --> 36:55.378
I wonder how Boil and Big Gurt
are faring at Emrick's castle!

36:55.380 --> 36:57.614
I wonder what will become
of our Wee Kingdom,

36:57.616 --> 36:58.915
if the mighty
Durwyn has returned!

36:58.917 --> 37:00.050
I wonder what to do next!

37:00.052 --> 37:01.785
I wonder how we can help!

37:01.786 --> 37:03.519
I wonder where we can run...
or where we can hide!

37:03.522 --> 37:07.123
In a perfect world, we wouldn't
have to run or hide anywhere!

37:07.125 --> 37:09.726
All this craziness
would blow over,

37:09.728 --> 37:12.162
and we could go back
home...where we belong!

37:12.164 --> 37:14.898
Yes, but it's not a perfect
world, Tink!

37:14.900 --> 37:18.235
It's a big, complicated,
convoluted, messy,
tricky world out there!

37:18.237 --> 37:21.905
And we're just two little wees,
trying to make sense of it all!

37:21.907 --> 37:25.642
You make being wee sound
like a bad thing, Cai!

37:25.644 --> 37:28.411
I'm proud of our wee heritage!

37:28.413 --> 37:31.147
Proud to call the
Wee Kingdom my home!

37:31.149 --> 37:34.017
Proud to be a tiny
green hybrid creature

37:34.019 --> 37:36.553
who most folks aren't
sure how to categorize.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.955
I wouldn't change
any of it for the world!

37:38.957 --> 37:41.424
You've always had a good head
on your shoulders, Tink!

37:41.426 --> 37:43.560
I don't have shoulders.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.995
You know what I mean.

37:44.997 --> 37:49.466
Yeah, imagine the internal
conflict I've had to live with.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.569
Sometimes I want to sleep
hanging upside down.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.305
Sometimes I want to curl
into a tight little ball.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.307
Sometimes I want to drink milk.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.441
Sometimes I want to drink...

37:58.443 --> 37:59.442
What, Tinkertoes?

37:59.444 --> 38:00.477
You want to drink what?

38:00.479 --> 38:03.213
Ah, never mind.

38:03.215 --> 38:04.214
Ok.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.149
Hey, I think I
know a safe place!

38:06.151 --> 38:08.585
And someone who
might be able to help us!

38:08.587 --> 38:09.586
Really?!

38:09.588 --> 38:10.587
Who?

38:10.589 --> 38:12.656
A dear old friend!

38:12.657 --> 38:14.724
We haven't talked in ages,
but he's one of the good ones,

38:14.726 --> 38:16.159
and I don't know
where else to turn!

38:16.161 --> 38:17.160
We need an ally!

38:17.162 --> 38:19.329
He could be our best hope!

38:19.331 --> 38:22.232
If you think we can trust him,
let's give it a shot!

38:22.234 --> 38:24.701
It's a bit of a
trek to get there.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.069
How are your wings holding up?

38:26.071 --> 38:30.073
Tired, but not too tired to save
the Wee Kingdom, if they can.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.909
That's all I needed to hear,
follow me. This way!

38:32.911 --> 38:35.845
Away we go!

38:37.249 --> 38:42.485
To-morrow, and to-morrow,
and to-morrow,

38:42.487 --> 38:46.956
Creeps in this petty
pace from day to day.

38:46.958 --> 38:50.727
To the last syllable
of recorded time.

38:50.729 --> 38:55.999
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.802
The way to dusty death.

38:58.804 --> 39:02.505
Out, out, brief candle!

39:02.507 --> 39:06.943
Life's but a walking shadow,
a poor player.

39:06.945 --> 39:11.881
That struts and frets his
hour upon the stage.

39:11.883 --> 39:17.721
And then is heard no more:
it is a tale

39:17.723 --> 39:22.726
told by an idiot,
full of sound and fury,

39:22.728 --> 39:25.028
Signifying nothing.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.130
(clapping)

39:27.132 --> 39:28.331
Huh?

39:28.333 --> 39:31.334
Who goes there?!
Durwyn, is that you?

39:31.336 --> 39:35.305
Returned to blight me
and revel in my woe?

39:35.307 --> 39:36.506
Not Durwyn!

39:36.508 --> 39:37.841
It's me, king!

39:37.976 --> 39:40.043
(slithering sound)

39:41.313 --> 39:42.779
Your old foe, Syd!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.114
Remember me?

39:44.116 --> 39:45.115
Remember?

39:45.117 --> 39:46.750
I'll never forget!

39:46.752 --> 39:51.187
You slimed the castle's
drawbridges in the
early morning mist!

39:51.189 --> 39:53.189
Ha ha ha!

39:53.191 --> 39:55.992
That was so much fun!

39:55.994 --> 39:59.045
Fun?

39:59.046 --> 40:02.097
You sent dozens of Wee Dragons
slipping and
sliding into the castle moat!

40:02.100 --> 40:05.201
Some of them couldn't swim!

40:05.203 --> 40:07.670
We're lucky to
have not lost lives!

40:07.672 --> 40:11.741
Yeah, well...you can't
win 'em all!

40:11.743 --> 40:15.645
What in tarnation
do you want, Syd?

40:15.647 --> 40:20.250
Or are you simply here to
wallow in my misfortune?

40:20.252 --> 40:21.885
Here to wallow, mostly!

40:21.887 --> 40:24.487
But you banished
me here, Bedwyr,

40:24.489 --> 40:29.125
so surely you knew I'd slide up
sooner or later, hmm?

40:29.127 --> 40:32.429
Aye...indeed.

40:32.431 --> 40:35.832
Here we are, King--or, should I
say, Prisoner Bedwyr!

40:35.834 --> 40:37.801
Your new home sweet home!

40:37.803 --> 40:42.305
The very spot you banished your
kingdom's
wrongdoers to, for so long!

40:42.307 --> 40:44.941
Funny, how things work out, hmm?

40:44.943 --> 40:45.942
Syd--

40:45.944 --> 40:47.944
That'll be Mister Syd to you!

40:47.946 --> 40:50.480
I always knew we'd
meet again, Bedwyr!

40:50.482 --> 40:55.018
Secrets never stay buried, no
matter how hard
to try to keep 'em down!

40:55.020 --> 41:00.857
Now, the mighty Durwyn rules
your land, and you get to see
how the other half live!

41:00.859 --> 41:02.826
Durwyn will never succeed!

41:02.828 --> 41:04.294
He already has!

41:04.296 --> 41:05.762
(laughs)

41:05.764 --> 41:08.097
You can't trust him, Syd!

41:08.099 --> 41:15.672
He'll use you, take advantage of
your loyalty, and discard you
once he has what he wants!

41:15.674 --> 41:17.173
That's funny!

41:17.175 --> 41:19.626
Sounds familiar!

41:19.627 --> 41:22.078
The more things change,
the more they stay the same,
huh?

41:22.080 --> 41:23.079
Yes!

41:23.081 --> 41:26.783
And that holds true for
Wee Dragons, too!

41:26.785 --> 41:31.988
The wee spirit will never submit
to the mighty Durwyn!

41:31.990 --> 41:35.191
His coup is
doomed to fail!

41:35.193 --> 41:37.060
You should know that!

41:37.062 --> 41:43.166
What I know is that an exiled
creature will say anything to
not be abandoned!

41:43.168 --> 41:45.602
But, it's too late
for pleas, Bedwyr!

41:45.604 --> 41:49.539
You've made your bed...
now Bed-wyr in it!

41:49.541 --> 41:50.507
What?

41:50.509 --> 41:52.141
You like that?

41:52.143 --> 41:53.443
Clever, hmm?

41:53.445 --> 41:59.516
You made the bed...
now<i> we're</i> in it, Bedwyr!

41:59.518 --> 42:01.618
Ah...very witty.

42:01.620 --> 42:05.788
Will you perform in
the new king's court?

42:05.790 --> 42:08.525
Perform?
I never considered it!

42:08.527 --> 42:09.826
Maybe I will!

42:09.828 --> 42:11.060
Doesn't hurt to ask!

42:11.062 --> 42:14.030
I notice Durwyn left you here.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.466
Didn't take you with him.

42:16.468 --> 42:19.369
You think that was an accident?

42:19.371 --> 42:21.504
Of course, it was!

42:21.506 --> 42:23.640
I'm small! It's dark!

42:23.642 --> 42:24.641
Things were hectic!

42:24.643 --> 42:26.009
The rush of freedom!

42:26.011 --> 42:27.744
The crackle of vengeance!

42:27.746 --> 42:30.013
Things happen...get overlooked.

42:30.015 --> 42:33.616
And you think
he'll come back for you?

42:33.618 --> 42:35.285
Absolutely! I have no doubts!

42:35.287 --> 42:39.289
For centuries, I was Durwyn's
sole companion!

42:39.291 --> 42:40.723
We shared stories!

42:40.725 --> 42:42.292
We shared dreams!

42:42.294 --> 42:46.629
We scratched thousands of
tic-tac-toe games
on these cave walls!

42:46.631 --> 42:50.016
Who won?

42:50.017 --> 42:53.402
He did, mostly...he has those
big claws, y'know.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.405
It takes me longer to
scratch into things,

42:55.407 --> 42:58.474
since I'm gelatinous and
all...lotsa times,

42:58.476 --> 43:01.711
he'd be asleep by the
time I made my x...

43:01.713 --> 43:03.846
but that's neither
here, nor there!

43:03.848 --> 43:06.249
What matters now is
the claw's on the other foot!

43:06.251 --> 43:07.850
Get comfy, Bedwyr!

43:07.852 --> 43:11.421
You're gonna be here
for a long, long time!

43:11.423 --> 43:13.022
(laughs)

43:13.024 --> 43:16.025
Now, if you'll excuse me,

43:16.027 --> 43:19.028
I'm gnawing
on a head of old lettuce!

43:19.030 --> 43:22.565
Stay on your side of the cave
and don't disturb me.

43:22.567 --> 43:25.535
It's the last of our
food for a while.

43:25.537 --> 43:26.636
Don't worry, Syd.

43:26.638 --> 43:29.872
I'll just pretend
you aren't there.

43:29.874 --> 43:32.942
Good!
(sighs)

43:37.816 --> 43:39.782
Don't listen to
this old fool, Boil!

43:39.784 --> 43:41.384
He's talking gibberish!

43:41.386 --> 43:44.220
The Wee Kingdom is forever!

43:44.222 --> 43:47.123
Forever and ever
and ever, and a day?

43:47.125 --> 43:50.360
Alas, your precious Wee Kingdom
has indeed gone away!

43:50.362 --> 43:51.894
Shut up, you big jerk!

43:51.896 --> 43:53.563
Remember what I said, Gurt!

43:53.565 --> 43:56.099
- Let him talk!
- Oh...right!

43:56.101 --> 43:57.100
Go ahead, wizard!

43:57.102 --> 43:58.935
Hit us with another rhyme!

43:58.937 --> 44:01.638
I'll hit you with more than you
ever asked for,

44:01.640 --> 44:05.608
until you're stunned on the
floor, searching for the door!

44:05.610 --> 44:09.579
Emrick, the beef between you and
us wees has been ongoing for so

44:09.581 --> 44:12.482
long, none of us can
even remember how it started!

44:12.484 --> 44:16.019
We don't even have anything
against you, but you attack us

44:16.021 --> 44:18.287
every time we encounter you,
without fail!

44:18.289 --> 44:21.424
Can't we just call a truce?

44:21.426 --> 44:25.428
Like you teased in King Bedwyr's
dreams, but for real!

44:25.430 --> 44:27.463
We can co-exist!

44:27.465 --> 44:28.398
I know we can!

44:28.400 --> 44:29.983
Ha!

44:29.984 --> 44:31.567
Sharing space with
a wee is no life for me!

44:31.569 --> 44:35.004
Gaining the upper hand
is where I forever stand!

44:35.006 --> 44:36.873
Okay, have it your way.

44:36.875 --> 44:41.644
But please, just tell
us...what's going
on back in our kingdom?

44:41.646 --> 44:42.845
Alright, wee!

44:42.847 --> 44:45.248
I'll share my sight, so you see!

44:45.250 --> 44:48.184
My senses, they ring!

44:48.186 --> 44:50.286
Bedwyr's throne has no king!

44:50.288 --> 44:53.990
There he goes, bad-mouthing
Bedwyr again!

44:53.992 --> 44:56.726
What happened to our king,
you mystic freak?!

44:56.728 --> 44:58.411
Gurt!

44:58.412 --> 45:00.095
A dragon of might,
means, and proportion

45:00.098 --> 45:03.566
has toppled your ruler,
through forceful extortion!

45:03.568 --> 45:04.634
A dragon?

45:04.636 --> 45:06.302
You mean a wee dragon?

45:06.304 --> 45:09.539
A wee times a million now
circles your sun!

45:09.541 --> 45:12.275
With the sound of a gurgle,
your king was undone!

45:12.277 --> 45:14.343
The sound of gurgle?

45:14.345 --> 45:15.344
Gurgle!

45:15.346 --> 45:17.714
He's talking about
Gurgle the wee!

45:17.716 --> 45:19.148
Oh!

45:19.150 --> 45:21.150
Did Gurgle betray
our King Bedwyr?!

45:21.152 --> 45:22.151
Hehehe!

45:22.153 --> 45:25.354
A sharp-witted wee
before me I see!

45:25.356 --> 45:29.058
While another plays the game,
and Gurgle's his name!

45:29.060 --> 45:31.327
Gurt, we need to
get home right away!

45:31.329 --> 45:32.929
The Wee Kingdom needs us!

45:32.931 --> 45:36.799
Alas, like a bee, the truth
sometimes stings!

45:36.801 --> 45:39.936
While that beast warms your
throne for the
king of all kings!

45:39.938 --> 45:42.138
Who's the king of all kings?

45:42.140 --> 45:45.775
Upon me your eyes gaze, you see
old, you see crazy!

45:45.777 --> 45:50.146
But I'll soon rule your land,
just as fresh as a daisy!

45:50.148 --> 45:51.714
Nice rhymes, Emrick!

45:51.716 --> 45:54.650
Keep working on your material -
maybe you can perform

45:54.652 --> 45:56.119
at the Wee
Thanksgiving celebration!

45:56.121 --> 45:57.987
The invitation still stands!

45:57.989 --> 46:01.724
I'll be there, Wee Boil, on that
you can count!

46:01.726 --> 46:05.495
Until then, keep your heads,
for the pressures will mount!

46:05.497 --> 46:08.564
(maniacal laugh)

46:13.505 --> 46:17.340
I'm telling you, that Emrick's
loonier than a hundred spotted
wee loons!

46:17.342 --> 46:20.060
No, Gurt!

46:20.061 --> 46:22.779
That old wizard acts crazy, but
he knows exactly
what he's doing!

46:22.781 --> 46:24.747
He told us a lot of
valuable information!

46:24.749 --> 46:28.284
If not for Emrick, we'd never
know there
was trouble back home!

46:28.286 --> 46:29.685
That's what worries me!

46:29.687 --> 46:33.623
If not for Emrick, we wouldn't
be flying home so fast...

46:33.625 --> 46:35.625
who's to say we're not
flying right into a trap?

46:35.627 --> 46:37.960
That's a risk we'll
have to take.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.896
We can't chance leaving the
Wee Kingdom in danger!

46:39.898 --> 46:41.964
What do we do when we get there?

46:41.966 --> 46:45.968
We'll be careful...get the lay
of the land...find
out what's going on.

46:45.970 --> 46:47.937
What if there's big trouble?

46:47.939 --> 46:48.938
We'll handle it!

46:48.940 --> 46:49.939
We're Wee Dragons!

46:49.941 --> 46:52.175
We were born for trouble!

46:52.177 --> 46:55.044
I like to think I was
born for dessert!

46:55.046 --> 46:57.280
Speaking of...about that bakery!

47:00.218 --> 47:02.852
Way to make
yourself known, Durwyn!

47:02.854 --> 47:05.188
You sure know how
to make an entrance!

47:05.190 --> 47:08.324
Now that all the wees know
there's a new king in town,

47:08.326 --> 47:11.294
we can start
laying down new rules!

47:11.296 --> 47:14.463
Indeed, Blister!

47:14.465 --> 47:22.538
But first, my eyes are heavy
and my wings are tired!

47:24.309 --> 47:25.374
(yawns)

47:25.376 --> 47:32.648
Well, I guess you did circle the
town quite a bit, letting every
wee know what's up!

47:32.650 --> 47:38.087
Yes...and now,
I feel like a nap!

47:38.089 --> 47:41.524
A nap? I didn't take you for the
napping kind, Durwyn.

47:44.095 --> 47:47.230
Mighty dragon Durwyn,
maw like a steel trap!

47:47.232 --> 47:51.067
Lay your head down on your
pillow and nap!

47:51.069 --> 47:54.470
Vivid dreams you shall have,
and sights you shall see!

47:54.472 --> 47:57.773
Let the wees plan,
and come plot with me!

47:57.775 --> 47:59.842
(giggles)

48:00.778 --> 48:02.645
What's that supposed to mean?!

48:02.647 --> 48:03.813
U-Uh, nothing!

48:03.815 --> 48:07.650
I just always pictured you
flying, or raging,

48:07.652 --> 48:11.320
or warring, or breathing fire,
that's all!

48:11.322 --> 48:12.488
Mighty stuff!

48:12.490 --> 48:15.925
Yes, well,
I do all those things!

48:15.927 --> 48:20.396
And I also take mighty naps!

48:20.398 --> 48:22.331
Is that a problem?!

48:22.333 --> 48:25.735
N-No, King Durwyn!
No problem at all!

48:25.737 --> 48:26.836
Good!

48:26.838 --> 48:31.374
Watch over my new land
as I slumber!

48:31.376 --> 48:36.846
If any wees behave suspiciously,
wake me at once!

48:36.848 --> 48:41.284
Otherwise, do not disturb my
deep sleep!

48:41.286 --> 48:43.185
I-I won't bother you!

48:43.187 --> 48:45.655
You have my word!

48:45.657 --> 48:47.790
As you were!

48:47.792 --> 48:51.627
Even fearsome rulers
need their rest!

48:51.629 --> 48:53.296
I-I agree!

48:53.298 --> 48:55.364
Rest in peace!

48:55.366 --> 48:59.435
What?!
Are you threatening me, wee?!

48:59.437 --> 49:00.436
No!

49:00.438 --> 49:01.437
I-I don't mean to-

49:01.439 --> 49:03.439
You'd better not!

49:03.441 --> 49:04.707
Rest in power!

49:04.709 --> 49:08.277
That's what I mean!
Rest in power!

49:08.279 --> 49:11.981
Hmmm...I plan to!

49:11.983 --> 49:17.186
Now be quiet, while I find a
comfortable bed!

49:17.188 --> 49:24.060
There's no telling what inane
remark might spill out of your
miniature maw next!

49:24.062 --> 49:31.567
If I don't lie down at once, I
may drop
right here on these bricks!

49:31.569 --> 49:32.935
(yawns)

49:32.937 --> 49:33.602
Yes, Dur--

49:33.604 --> 49:35.571
Shhh!

49:35.573 --> 49:36.305
Ye--

49:40.078 --> 49:42.645
It's not far now!
We're almost there!

49:42.647 --> 49:43.679
Almost where?

49:43.681 --> 49:45.464
To my old friend's turf!

49:45.465 --> 49:47.248
It's been a while, but I still
remember the way!

49:47.251 --> 49:48.918
You've been here before?

49:48.920 --> 49:52.688
It figures I'd come here now,
while our kingdom's

49:52.690 --> 49:54.490
being overthrown and
our friends are in an

49:54.492 --> 49:56.993
evil wizard's mountain castle.

49:56.995 --> 49:59.261
That's not distracting at all.

49:59.263 --> 50:03.099
Let's just enjoy all this fruit
and make some
new friends, right?

50:03.101 --> 50:07.069
Hey, remember we're here to help
save our kingdom and
everyone in it.

50:07.071 --> 50:10.306
We need to trust that they'll
stay strong while we're gone.

50:10.308 --> 50:12.408
And don't forget - they're wees.

50:12.410 --> 50:15.177
The strongest dragons around!

50:15.179 --> 50:16.746
Except for Durwyn.

50:16.748 --> 50:19.515
Oh, yeah.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.017
Except for that.

50:21.819 --> 50:28.491
Mmmm...how relaxing...how
rejuvenating...

50:28.493 --> 50:34.463
and what a stark and
vivid dream this is...

50:34.465 --> 50:41.370
the sights, the smells, the
sounds, the details...

50:41.372 --> 50:48.944
the shining stars in the sky,
the cracks in the stone wall,

50:48.946 --> 50:53.115
the warm glow of the candle...

50:53.117 --> 50:55.017
What?!

50:55.019 --> 50:57.353
What mad sorcery is this?!

50:57.355 --> 50:59.221
Not mad, mighty dragon!

50:59.223 --> 51:01.490
Things aren't always
as they seem!

51:01.492 --> 51:06.462
The mind holds chambers inside
chambers, like
a dream within a dream!

51:06.464 --> 51:07.596
Emrick!

51:07.598 --> 51:10.366
You crazy old wizard!

51:10.368 --> 51:14.703
I knew I couldn't
possibly be so weary!

51:14.705 --> 51:17.006
You've enveloped me in a spell!

51:17.008 --> 51:18.941
Oh, dear!
What a pity!

51:18.943 --> 51:21.577
'Tis a crying shame!

51:21.578 --> 51:24.212
A spell, dark magic,
or witchcraft - what's in a
name?

51:24.215 --> 51:26.048
Release me at once, old man!

51:26.050 --> 51:30.286
Or suffer the consequences!

51:30.288 --> 51:33.022
And what consequences
would those be?

51:33.024 --> 51:35.658
What could you do
that I'd not foresee?

51:35.660 --> 51:38.928
You've mistaken me, wizard!

51:38.930 --> 51:42.665
Times have changed!

51:42.667 --> 51:47.369
I'm not the imprisoned beast
with clipped wings you knew,

51:47.371 --> 51:49.872
I'm the King of the Wees!

51:49.874 --> 51:54.343
King of Wees, or bees, or trees
- any of these!

51:54.345 --> 51:57.346
Why rule the land when you can
also have the seas?

51:57.348 --> 51:58.514
You riddling old coot!

51:58.516 --> 52:01.317
I don't understand
a thing you say!

52:01.319 --> 52:03.052
Lucky for you,
I'm not really here!

52:03.054 --> 52:05.254
Here, there, no matter where!

52:05.256 --> 52:07.923
The will to power
is in your stare!

52:07.925 --> 52:11.627
Now the wees have fallen,
your flames have fanned!

52:11.629 --> 52:14.396
But immortality's in my hand!

52:14.398 --> 52:15.064
Ha!

52:15.066 --> 52:16.565
Immortality?!

52:16.567 --> 52:21.270
Go back to selling snake oil in
Movember, wizard!

52:21.272 --> 52:25.074
Leave us kings
to our kingly pursuits!

52:25.076 --> 52:26.909
Kingly is right, Durwyn!

52:26.911 --> 52:28.410
To me you'll come round!

52:28.412 --> 52:31.480
I'll control them with magic,
while you wear the crown!

52:31.482 --> 52:37.186
Why would I share my land with
the likes of a madman?!

52:37.188 --> 52:43.325
After I alone clawed tooth and
nail to return from exile and

52:43.327 --> 52:45.561
conquer my conquerors?!

52:45.563 --> 52:48.664
Because, mighty dragon,
your word is now law!

52:48.666 --> 52:51.700
But Bedwyr's dethronement
is not all that I saw!

52:51.702 --> 52:53.102
Eh?!

52:53.104 --> 52:57.006
Explain yourself without the
games, seer!

52:57.008 --> 53:02.011
I've no patience for trickery,
even in sleep!

53:02.013 --> 53:05.915
Very well, I'll lay bare
all the perils I see!

53:05.917 --> 53:09.418
You have might, but you can't
keep wees down without me!

53:09.420 --> 53:11.387
Out with it, Emrick!

53:11.389 --> 53:16.959
Or you'll find out fire burns
just as hot in your dreams!

53:16.961 --> 53:18.194
Hehehe!

53:18.196 --> 53:20.262
I like your style, Durwyn!

53:20.264 --> 53:21.630
Those wees, they are cunning!

53:21.632 --> 53:23.399
They speak to our ears!

53:23.401 --> 53:27.937
But their actions prove
otherwise, so exploit
their fears!

53:27.939 --> 53:30.406
To stamp out their light,
take all that they own!

53:30.408 --> 53:33.275
Turn their hopeful wee whisper
into a mournful moan!

53:33.277 --> 53:36.946
Give it to me in
layman's terms, Emrick!

53:36.948 --> 53:39.248
The Wee Dragons
will eventually rise up!

53:39.250 --> 53:43.485
They are small, but have
strength in their
numbers, wise up!

53:43.487 --> 53:47.690
Close their shops and
burn their crops, is a start!

53:47.692 --> 53:51.994
Join forces with me,
and break their wee hearts!

53:51.996 --> 53:56.732
You have a way with words,
you know that?!

53:56.734 --> 54:00.869
It's the magic mustache -
it converts every
thoughts into poetry.

54:00.871 --> 54:03.639
I wish my tendrils
would do that!

54:03.641 --> 54:05.174
Then let's team up!

54:05.176 --> 54:08.344
I'll transform you into a
silver-tendrilled devil!

54:08.346 --> 54:09.345
Sweet!

54:09.347 --> 54:11.680
Where do we begin?!

54:11.682 --> 54:15.150
With a new king in his kingdom,
and a wizard on high!

54:15.152 --> 54:19.655
Wake up, mighty dragon,
for the wee end is nigh!

54:24.262 --> 54:26.195
What a nap!

54:26.197 --> 54:28.497
I needed that, Blister!

54:29.467 --> 54:31.033
What a relief!

54:31.035 --> 54:33.736
You're a bear when you're tired!

54:33.738 --> 54:37.073
A bear?!

54:37.074 --> 54:40.409
I've never resembled such a puny
beast in all my centuries!

54:40.411 --> 54:45.614
Tell me, how is our former king,
Bedwyr, faring?

54:45.616 --> 54:47.950
He's almost
completely lost hope!

54:47.952 --> 54:52.021
Great!

54:52.022 --> 54:56.091
Before my reign is over, I'll
make that Wee Dragon beg to
return to his old kingdom!

54:56.093 --> 54:59.995
And I may even let him,

54:59.997 --> 55:05.100
just to see the look
on his wee face!

55:05.102 --> 55:08.437
Because, much like
my own experience,

55:08.439 --> 55:13.075
it won't resemble the
place he left at all!

55:13.077 --> 55:14.393
No?

55:14.394 --> 55:15.710
What are your planning,
King Durwyn?

55:15.713 --> 55:19.315
How will you transform this
drab, boring kingdom

55:19.317 --> 55:22.951
into the empire of
excitement and pillar of

55:22.953 --> 55:24.887
pizzazz we know it can be!

55:24.889 --> 55:25.888
We?

55:25.890 --> 55:28.857
Er, um...you.
I mean you.

55:28.859 --> 55:31.493
That's right, you did!

55:31.495 --> 55:33.462
And I'll tell you, Pee Wee!

55:33.464 --> 55:37.399
First, I'm going to close the
town's shops!

55:37.401 --> 55:38.400
Yeah!

55:38.402 --> 55:41.270
What will you put in their
place?!

55:41.272 --> 55:43.072
Nothing!

55:43.074 --> 55:45.074
Er...nothing?

55:45.076 --> 55:46.742
Nothing!

55:46.744 --> 55:51.046
I'm going to put an
end to wee industry!

55:51.048 --> 55:53.449
No more blacksmithing!

55:53.451 --> 55:56.285
No more woodworking!

55:56.287 --> 55:59.688
No more baked goods!

55:59.690 --> 56:03.292
No more
performances in the park!

56:03.294 --> 56:06.762
In fact, no congregating!

56:06.764 --> 56:14.002
Wee citizens will stay indoors,
unless called upon to appear!

56:14.004 --> 56:15.304
Oh...that sounds--

56:15.306 --> 56:19.341
Amazing, I know!

56:19.343 --> 56:20.342
I was gonna say--

56:20.344 --> 56:22.678
Tremendous, yes!

56:22.680 --> 56:27.282
No need to reiterate what we
already know, Blister!

56:27.284 --> 56:34.456
That only leads to more wee
talking, and heaven
knows I've heard enough!

56:34.458 --> 56:41.797
As your new king, I'll create
work farms, hard labor camps,

56:43.334 --> 56:48.704
and sweatshops for you wees
to occupy yourselves in!

56:48.706 --> 56:52.775
Wees will work
from morning to night!

56:52.777 --> 56:58.447
Productivity will rise to
heights never before seen!

56:58.449 --> 57:00.149
What about me, King Durwyn?

57:00.151 --> 57:04.353
What about you, Gurgle?

57:04.355 --> 57:06.422
What's my place
in the king's court?

57:06.424 --> 57:08.624
Will I be your consigliere?

57:08.626 --> 57:10.058
My what?!

57:10.060 --> 57:13.529
You know, your advisor!
Your confidante!

57:13.531 --> 57:15.230
Your right wing man!

57:15.232 --> 57:20.536
You'll be my nothing and you'll
like it, how's that?!

57:20.538 --> 57:25.908
Uhh...t-that's not really
w-what I had in mind.

57:25.910 --> 57:30.045
I don't care what
you had in mind, wee!

57:30.047 --> 57:36.852
Your mind is of little
consequence to me - and
littler consequence to you!

57:36.854 --> 57:40.422
It's no longer
your place to think!

57:40.424 --> 57:43.225
You're here to obey!

57:43.227 --> 57:48.630
Um, but...but, I brought you
in...I brought you back!

57:48.632 --> 57:52.734
The least I deserve is a
spot in your king's court!

57:52.736 --> 57:55.404
My king's court?!

57:55.406 --> 57:58.974
Durwyn flies alone, wee!

57:58.976 --> 58:03.745
Always has, always will!

58:03.747 --> 58:10.686
Oh, so we won't be working on
new laws together?

58:10.688 --> 58:15.757
No, you ushered in a mighty
dragon who answers

58:15.759 --> 58:20.195
to no one, especially
not a wee dragon.

58:20.197 --> 58:25.133
And you have the audacity to
think you're in a partnership?

58:25.135 --> 58:26.301
Fool!

58:26.303 --> 58:27.302
- But...you said...
- Bap!

58:27.304 --> 58:28.303
Bap!

58:28.305 --> 58:30.439
- What about-
- Bap! Bap!

58:30.441 --> 58:32.174
Doh, left out again!

58:32.176 --> 58:36.144
What do I gotta go to get some
respect around here?

58:37.848 --> 58:39.431
Look at it down there, Boil.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.015
Wee Kingdom is practically a
ghost town.

58:41.018 --> 58:43.051
Where'd every wee go?

58:43.053 --> 58:47.089
Hopefully they're just inside
and not...you know.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.090
Know what?

58:48.092 --> 58:50.292
You know, not...

58:50.294 --> 58:52.528
Not outside?

58:52.530 --> 58:53.562
Come on, Gurt.
Think.

58:53.564 --> 58:55.564
I'm trying. I'm trying!

58:55.566 --> 58:59.401
I skipped breakfast, lunch, and
now it's almost dinnertime.

58:59.403 --> 59:00.536
I'm delirious.

59:00.538 --> 59:03.539
I need calories.

59:03.541 --> 59:06.408
Well, we'd grab a snack but
all the shops looks closed.

59:06.410 --> 59:08.377
That's crazy.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.345
How's a kingdom supposed to
survive without business?

59:10.347 --> 59:11.780
Without citizens working
together?

59:11.782 --> 59:14.216
Maybe that's the point, Gurt.

59:14.218 --> 59:16.885
Maybe our
Wee Kingdom is no more.

59:16.887 --> 59:19.488
Oh no!

59:19.490 --> 59:21.623
What if getting us to
go to Emrick's castle

59:21.625 --> 59:24.927
was all part of some sinister
trick played to perfection

59:24.929 --> 59:27.796
by forces who want to destroy
our Wee Kingdom?

59:27.798 --> 59:28.797
Look!

59:28.799 --> 59:30.499
Down there! It's Blister!

59:30.501 --> 59:31.500
And he's talking to--

59:31.502 --> 59:32.935
The mighty Durwyn!

59:32.937 --> 59:34.836
Oh, this is bad!

59:34.838 --> 59:36.405
This is real bad!

59:36.407 --> 59:38.173
But, I thought Durwyn was
banished forever!

59:38.175 --> 59:40.075
So did I!

59:40.077 --> 59:41.977
Magic works in
mysterious ways, Gurt!

59:41.979 --> 59:45.047
This is the alliance Emrick
talked about!

59:45.049 --> 59:46.048
Obviously!

59:46.050 --> 59:47.916
How could Blister
betray us like this?

59:47.918 --> 59:49.785
His own dragons!

59:49.787 --> 59:52.688
And is Gurgle involved, too?

59:52.689 --> 59:55.590
If they're all in cahoots, what
in the world
can any wee do to stop them?!

59:55.593 --> 59:59.027
I don't know, Gurt...
I just don't know.

1:00:01.899 --> 1:00:05.567
I can't believe I've found
myself in this predicament!

1:00:05.569 --> 1:00:07.235
What a mess!

1:00:07.237 --> 1:00:12.040
I just hope my beloved wees are
safe and sound, as I speak.

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:15.210
Dreams!

1:00:15.211 --> 1:00:18.379
How could I be so foolish as to
fall for such obvious sorcery?

1:00:18.382 --> 1:00:19.881
Such blatant wizardry!

1:00:19.883 --> 1:00:23.552
It's practically Dark Magic 101!

1:00:23.554 --> 1:00:29.057
I knew I should've finished wee
college, I knew it!

1:00:31.261 --> 1:00:34.696
But...I'm a Wee Dragon.

1:00:34.698 --> 1:00:42.070
The young ones don't realize it
yet, but we're not without
magical powers of our own

1:00:42.072 --> 1:00:48.310
I haven't used mine in a
while...in a long while...

1:00:48.312 --> 1:00:52.714
I'm rusty, for sure, but...

1:00:52.716 --> 1:01:00.789
Hear me, oh, wise Sage...it's
your old friend, Bedwyr...

1:01:01.325 --> 1:01:04.660
and my situation is dire...

1:01:06.130 --> 1:01:10.932
the Wee Dragon
Kingdom is under attack,

1:01:10.934 --> 1:01:16.238
and the Wee Dragons
are in grave danger...

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:19.808
can you hear me, oh, Sage?

1:01:21.278 --> 1:01:24.179
Times have grown dark.

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:27.015
Can you light the path for us?

1:01:30.287 --> 1:01:31.953
Hello, Bedwyr!

1:01:31.955 --> 1:01:33.388
Sage?!

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:37.626
It's good to hear your voice
again, my friend!

1:01:37.628 --> 1:01:40.195
The feeling is mutual, compadre!

1:01:40.197 --> 1:01:42.631
I am sorry to hear
of your troubles!

1:01:42.633 --> 1:01:45.467
Tell me...what is the source of
your problems?

1:01:45.469 --> 1:01:48.937
A wayward wee has betrayed us!

1:01:48.939 --> 1:01:55.610
An exiled dragon has invaded us!
And an evil wizard maligns us!

1:01:55.612 --> 1:01:59.281
My goodness! You've got
your work cut out for you!

1:01:59.283 --> 1:02:03.318
Aye! That, I do, Sage!

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:06.655
Hold those thoughts, while I
feel what you feel.

1:02:06.657 --> 1:02:09.991
Uh...okay.

1:02:09.993 --> 1:02:18.066
Hmmmm...

1:02:21.672 --> 1:02:23.271
Emrick the Wizard!

1:02:23.273 --> 1:02:26.241
Yes! Yes, that's him!

1:02:26.243 --> 1:02:28.376
Durwyn, the mighty dragon!

1:02:28.378 --> 1:02:30.946
Yes! Yes!

1:02:30.948 --> 1:02:37.352
And...and...gag...gag...

1:02:37.354 --> 1:02:39.755
Gurgle!

1:02:39.757 --> 1:02:41.823
His name's Gurgle, Sage!

1:02:42.359 --> 1:02:44.426
(retches)

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:50.098
(clears throat)

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:54.770
Sorry...I'm having sprouts for
dinner...one
went down the wrong way.

1:02:54.772 --> 1:02:59.474
Oh, be careful.
Drink some water.

1:02:59.476 --> 1:03:01.743
Oh, I am.

1:03:01.745 --> 1:03:05.113
My roots guzzle
gallons constantly.

1:03:05.115 --> 1:03:06.214
Whew.

1:03:06.216 --> 1:03:09.050
Okay, good.

1:03:09.052 --> 1:03:13.054
The key to saving the Wee
Kingdom lies in
the Shiitake Islands.

1:03:13.056 --> 1:03:15.891
The Shiitake Islands?

1:03:15.893 --> 1:03:18.627
In the south Wee Sea?

1:03:18.629 --> 1:03:21.029
But I'm imprisoned!

1:03:21.031 --> 1:03:24.166
Prison is in the mind,
Bedwyr...

1:03:24.168 --> 1:03:28.403
or, in dendrology terms,
free your trunk and

1:03:28.405 --> 1:03:30.705
your roots will follow.

1:03:30.707 --> 1:03:33.375
Oh, I see.

1:03:33.377 --> 1:03:37.445
I think...

1:03:37.447 --> 1:03:40.081
Your closest companions on the
Shiitake will unlock the

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:43.919
antidote that can dispel
the magic that plagues you!

1:03:43.921 --> 1:03:49.658
But...I don't know a wee
soul in the Shiitake Islands!

1:03:52.596 --> 1:03:55.096
Howdy, stranger!

1:03:55.098 --> 1:03:56.932
Moldspot! Is that you?!

1:03:56.934 --> 1:03:57.933
In the fungus!

1:03:57.935 --> 1:03:59.801
How are ya, sweetheart?

1:03:59.803 --> 1:04:01.870
Well...I've been better, Moldy!

1:04:01.872 --> 1:04:05.707
Oh yeah? you having heatstroke
like your little friend here?

1:04:05.709 --> 1:04:09.110
Nothing a few of those
pineapples wouldn't fix, pal.

1:04:09.112 --> 1:04:11.313
(laughs)

1:04:11.315 --> 1:04:12.447
I'll bet.

1:04:12.449 --> 1:04:14.950
You're a
strange-looking fruit bat.

1:04:14.952 --> 1:04:16.084
I'm Moldspot.

1:04:16.086 --> 1:04:17.686
Who might you be?

1:04:17.688 --> 1:04:19.321
Fruit bat?

1:04:19.323 --> 1:04:24.192
I'm Tinkertoes, but I haven't
got long to live.

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:25.660
Cai, please.

1:04:25.662 --> 1:04:26.928
The pineapples.

1:04:26.930 --> 1:04:28.296
In a minute, Tink, just breathe.

1:04:28.298 --> 1:04:30.866
I need to talk to
my friend real quick.

1:04:30.868 --> 1:04:32.567
Shoot, wee.

1:04:32.569 --> 1:04:37.372
The Wee Kingdom's been invaded
by a mighty dragon with a grudge
against our kind.

1:04:37.374 --> 1:04:41.476
Our king's in danger and we
think an evil wizard has his

1:04:41.478 --> 1:04:43.845
bony fingers in this mess, too.

1:04:43.847 --> 1:04:47.315
Whoah, that's a
gnarly situation, girl.

1:04:47.317 --> 1:04:48.416
Tell me about it!

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:50.485
Can you help us?

1:04:50.487 --> 1:04:51.653
Sure!

1:04:51.655 --> 1:04:53.255
Sounds like dark magic!

1:04:53.257 --> 1:04:56.725
And I have just the
antidote for dark magic!

1:04:56.727 --> 1:04:57.726
You do?!

1:04:57.728 --> 1:04:59.194
I sure do!

1:04:59.196 --> 1:05:01.596
You've come to
the right place, wees!

1:05:01.598 --> 1:05:04.666
Welcome to the Shiitake Islands!

1:05:07.905 --> 1:05:11.606
Guys! Guys!
I need to talk to you!

1:05:11.608 --> 1:05:15.043
Oh, lookey who we have here!

1:05:15.045 --> 1:05:18.413
Yeah...if it isn't two-faced
Gurgle himself!

1:05:18.415 --> 1:05:19.414
Yeah!

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:20.448
How's Blister?!

1:05:20.450 --> 1:05:21.783
And Durwyn?!

1:05:21.785 --> 1:05:25.153
Oh...guys, I'm so, so sorry!

1:05:25.155 --> 1:05:27.255
I've made a terrible mistake!

1:05:27.257 --> 1:05:28.256
I'll say!

1:05:28.258 --> 1:05:30.425
You sold us out, Gurgle!

1:05:30.427 --> 1:05:31.943
Big time!

1:05:31.944 --> 1:05:33.460
You betrayed the best
friends you ever had!

1:05:33.463 --> 1:05:35.330
I didn't mean to!

1:05:35.332 --> 1:05:38.050
I got confused!

1:05:38.051 --> 1:05:40.769
That's easy to say, now that
we've figured
out your little scheme!

1:05:40.771 --> 1:05:42.704
What's the matter?

1:05:42.705 --> 1:05:44.638
Did your friends turn on you,
like you turned on us?

1:05:44.641 --> 1:05:46.241
I'm sorry, Boil!

1:05:46.243 --> 1:05:49.144
I wish I could take it back!

1:05:49.146 --> 1:05:50.145
Only you can't!

1:05:50.147 --> 1:05:51.613
It's too late!

1:05:51.615 --> 1:05:54.282
You broke the first rule of
Wee Dragonhood!

1:05:54.284 --> 1:05:55.283
I did?

1:05:55.285 --> 1:05:56.952
Yes, you did!

1:05:56.954 --> 1:05:59.487
Us wees are supposed
to stick together!

1:05:59.489 --> 1:06:02.190
Through thick or thin!

1:06:02.192 --> 1:06:03.792
Sickness or health!

1:06:03.794 --> 1:06:05.727
Good times or bad!

1:06:05.729 --> 1:06:07.262
Feast or famine!

1:06:07.264 --> 1:06:09.030
Hey... is anyone else hungry?

1:06:09.032 --> 1:06:10.365
I could eat!

1:06:10.367 --> 1:06:11.366
Me, too!

1:06:11.368 --> 1:06:13.301
I haven't eaten all day!

1:06:13.303 --> 1:06:14.336
I'm starving!

1:06:14.338 --> 1:06:16.671
Let's go back to my place!

1:06:16.673 --> 1:06:20.408
We're eating in, what with all
the trouble around here!

1:06:20.410 --> 1:06:24.946
Mom's got some yummy ramen
noodles on the stove!

1:06:24.948 --> 1:06:25.947
Okay!

1:06:25.949 --> 1:06:27.782
Gurt, are we gonna
believe this jerk?

1:06:27.784 --> 1:06:30.151
He's betrayed us at every turn!

1:06:30.153 --> 1:06:31.786
Helped overthrow our king!

1:06:31.788 --> 1:06:33.388
Turned our land
over to a mighty dragon!

1:06:33.390 --> 1:06:38.226
And we're just gonna let bygones
be bygones,
and eat ramen noodles together?

1:06:38.228 --> 1:06:40.095
I'm really hungry, Boil!

1:06:40.097 --> 1:06:43.598
And I'd like a
chance to explain!

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:48.770
I just listened to what Blister
was telling
me, and...and I can fix things!

1:06:48.772 --> 1:06:50.538
I promise!

1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:52.240
Yummy ramen noodles, Boil!

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:56.811
I know you must be hungry,
too...not as hungry
as me, but probably close!

1:06:56.813 --> 1:06:59.314
Okay, fine!

1:06:59.315 --> 1:07:01.816
But one wrong move, Gurgle, and
you're in big wee trouble!

1:07:01.818 --> 1:07:06.621
If you think the mighty Durwyn's
tough, you ain't
seen nothing yet!

1:07:06.623 --> 1:07:07.722
That's right!

1:07:07.724 --> 1:07:08.723
This isn't over!

1:07:08.725 --> 1:07:10.792
Not by a long shot!

1:07:10.793 --> 1:07:12.860
We're gonna find our king and
return our Wee Kingdom to normal

1:07:12.863 --> 1:07:16.464
- no matter how long it takes,
or how tough the going gets!

1:07:16.466 --> 1:07:18.400
When the going gets tough,
the wees get going!

1:07:18.402 --> 1:07:20.001
That's a figure of speech!

1:07:20.003 --> 1:07:21.569
Yes, it is, Gurt!

1:07:21.571 --> 1:07:22.670
Yes, it is!

1:07:22.672 --> 1:07:24.139
How 'bout this...

1:07:24.141 --> 1:07:27.642
when the going gets tough, the
wees get tougher!

1:07:27.644 --> 1:07:28.810
I like that, too!

1:07:28.812 --> 1:07:30.645
Sure, why not?

1:07:30.647 --> 1:07:34.582
I'll tell you guys, we sure are
tough little wees
when we have to be.

1:07:34.584 --> 1:07:36.651
You got that right, Gurt.

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:40.989
We got quite a great adventure
ahead, wees,
if we are to defeat Durwyn!

1:07:40.991 --> 1:07:43.691
We're just getting started!
Are you with us, Gurgle?

1:07:43.693 --> 1:07:48.329
I'm with you, wees!
I'm with you, wees!

1:07:48.331 --> 1:07:50.198
All for wee!

1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:51.866
(both)
And wee for all!

1:07:55.005 --> 1:07:58.106
What fun it is, toying with this
Wee Kingdom!

1:07:58.108 --> 1:08:03.011
All of these twerps, like
puppets on a string!

1:08:03.013 --> 1:08:08.083
Attached to my formidable claws.

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:11.352
I say jump and they jump!

1:08:11.354 --> 1:08:14.389
I say sit, and they sit!

1:08:14.391 --> 1:08:19.227
And none dare rise up
against the mighty Durwyn...

1:08:19.229 --> 1:08:20.428
(laughs)

1:08:20.430 --> 1:08:21.930
Or else!

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:23.998
(maniacal laugh)

1:08:26.503 --> 1:08:28.570
(music plays)

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.066
(music continues)

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:48.316
(music fades)
