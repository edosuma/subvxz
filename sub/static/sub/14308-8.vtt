WEBVTT

00:10.233 --> 00:12.267
TAYLOR'S BIRTHDAY
IS TOMORROW!

00:12.300 --> 00:15.633
- EXACTLY. SO WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY?

00:15.667 --> 00:18.067
- PSSH! MAYBE BECAUSE
IT'S THE FIRST BIRTHDAY

00:18.100 --> 00:20.400
THE HATHAWAYS AND PRESTONS
WILL BE CELEBRATING TOGETHER.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.533
IT'S LIKE WE'RE BECOMING
A NORMAL FAMILY.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.200
- HAS ANYONE SEEN
MY BOTTOM?

00:28.233 --> 00:31.233
- YEP. JUST LIKE
A NORMAL FAMILY.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.267
- I WAS PRETENDING
TO SAW MYSELF IN HALF

00:33.300 --> 00:35.300
AND MY LEGS WALKED AWAY.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.167
WAIT.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.300
LAUNDRY ROOM!

00:45.333 --> 00:47.167
I'M COMING, LOWER LOUIE!

00:52.600 --> 00:56.567
- OKAY, LOWER LOUIE IS NOT
INVITED TO TAYLOR'S PARTY.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.200
- MILES, THERE'S SOMETHING
SHOULD KNOW

00:58.233 --> 01:01.467
ABOUT TAYLOR AND BIRTHDAYS.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.333
- THERE'S THE BIRTHDAY GIRL!

01:07.500 --> 01:08.767
- SHE HATES THEM.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.800
- NOBODY HATES BIRTHDAYS.

01:10.833 --> 01:13.233
- TAYLOR DOES.
THERE WAS A...

01:13.267 --> 01:16.833
INCIDENT...
THREE YEARS AGO.

01:16.867 --> 01:19.233
- MOM, PLEASE DON'T.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.500
YOU CAN'T TELL THIS STORY

01:20.533 --> 01:23.567
WITHOUT HAVING
AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.300
- I CAN, AND I WILL.
AHEM.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.167
FOR YEARS, TAYLOR HAD BEEN
BEGGING TO GET A DOG.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.533
IT WAS
HER ONLY BIRTHDAY WISH.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.800
SO FINALLY,
WHEN SHE TURNED TEN...

01:33.833 --> 01:37.400
I SURPRISED HER...
WITH A PUPPY.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.200
- TAYLOR OPENED THE BOX,
PULLED OUT THE DOG,

01:39.233 --> 01:41.733
AND STARTED SNEEZING
LIKE A FREAK.

01:41.767 --> 01:44.300
- BIG TIME.

01:44.333 --> 01:47.733
HER ARMS PUFFED UP,
HER FACE TURNED PURPLE,

01:47.767 --> 01:50.800
BUT THEN SHE SNEEZED
ALL OVER THE CAKE.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.833
- WE HAD TO GIVE
THE DOG AWAY.

01:52.867 --> 01:55.533
TAYLOR SPENT
THE WHOLE NIGHT CRYING.

01:55.567 --> 01:58.267
MAMA BROKE HER HEART!

01:58.300 --> 02:00.633
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.200
BUT...I REFUSE TO LET HER
WALK AROUND THE REST OF HER LIFE

02:03.233 --> 02:04.367
HATING HER BIRTHDAY.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.233
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

02:06.267 --> 02:07.733
- HEY, BOW TIE....

02:07.767 --> 02:09.500
WE DON'T HAVE TO
BUY THE GIRL PRESENTS.

02:09.533 --> 02:12.167
DON'T ROCK THE BOAT.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.533
- BUT IT JUST ISN'T RIGHT.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.467
- NEITHER IS THAT.

02:21.367 --> 02:25.767
OH. HEH!

02:25.800 --> 02:29.067
ALL THE COOL GHOSTS ARE
WEARING THEIR LEGS BACKWARDS.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.467
DEAL WITH IT.

02:34.733 --> 02:37.533
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:37.567 --> 02:40.400
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:40.433 --> 02:42.500
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:42.533 --> 02:46.467
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:46.500 --> 02:48.700
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:48.733 --> 02:50.333
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:50.367 --> 02:53.200
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:53.233 --> 02:56.067
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:56.100 --> 02:58.133
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:58.167 --> 03:01.767
*

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:03.833 --> 03:06.200
*

03:09.433 --> 03:11.400
- MORNING, EVERYONE.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.833
- HAPPY...SATURDAY,
SWEETHEART.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.500
WHAT A NORMAL DAY
WE ARE HAVING,

03:16.533 --> 03:20.133
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER
NON-SPECIAL DAY.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.867
- GOOD SAVE.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.867
THANK YOU.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.367
- GUYS, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.300
JUST AS LONG AS NO ONE
BRINGS IT UP.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.133
- * HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

03:30.167 --> 03:31.633
* HAPPY,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY *

03:31.667 --> 03:33.833
* HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

03:33.867 --> 03:36.133
WHOOO!

03:36.167 --> 03:38.800
- MILES...HEH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:38.833 --> 03:40.467
- TAYLOR, I KNOW HOW YOU HATE

03:40.500 --> 03:42.333
BEING REMINDED
OF YOUR BIRTHDAY...

03:42.367 --> 03:45.733
BECAUSE THE BASS DRUM
IS SENDING MIXED SIGNALS.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.633
- IT WASN'T EASY,

03:47.667 --> 03:50.367
BUT I FIGURED OUT A WAY FOR YOU
TO ENJOY YOUR BIRTHDAY AGAIN.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.700
REPLACE A BAD MEMORY
WITH A GOOD ONE.

03:51.733 --> 03:56.367
VOILA!

03:56.400 --> 03:58.300
- AAH!

03:58.333 --> 04:00.700
- MILES,
TAYLOR IS ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

04:00.733 --> 04:04.567
- YEAH! SHE'S GONNA BLOW UP
LIKE A WALRUS!

04:04.600 --> 04:06.367
- THAT'S JUST IT.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.667
I KNOW TAY'S ALLERGIC,
WHICH IS WHY I GOT HER...

04:08.700 --> 04:10.667
A GHOST DOG!

04:13.633 --> 04:16.233
- WHOA! SWEET!

04:16.267 --> 04:19.367
- ALL THE CUTENESS,
NONE OF THE MUCUS!

04:23.433 --> 04:24.867
INDEED, M'LADY.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.767
all: HE TALKS?
- I DO.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.100
- SIR WAGSWORTH BARKSALOT
THE THIRD AT YOUR SERVICE.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.833
- OH, MY GOSH.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.100
I CAN FINALLY HAVE A DOG.

04:35.133 --> 04:38.300
MILES, THIS IS
THE BEST PRESENT EVER.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.200
audience: AWW!

04:40.233 --> 04:43.400
- I'M GONNA CALL YOU WAGS.
YOU ARE ADORABLE.

04:43.433 --> 04:46.233
- YOU ARE.

04:46.267 --> 04:49.133
BIRTHDAY PARTY TONIGHT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.333
- WAGS, YOU WANT TO COME
TO MY PARTY?

04:52.533 --> 04:56.167
I'M READY TO RAISE THE WOOF!

04:56.200 --> 04:58.467
- HEY, GUYS--AAH!

04:58.500 --> 04:59.733
WHO LET THAT THING
IN HERE?

04:59.767 --> 05:02.100
- HE'S MY NEW DOG, WAGS.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.700
- RAY, ARE YOU AFRAID
OF DOGS?

05:04.733 --> 05:06.600
- UH...HEH!

05:06.633 --> 05:08.133
OF COURSE NOT.

05:08.167 --> 05:10.567
DOGS ARE...NIFTY.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.767
- OOH, I LIKE YOU.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.700
HOW ABOUT A NICE
BELLY SCRATCH?

05:14.733 --> 05:19.633
- I'D LOVE TO...
BUT I'M LATE FOR PRACTICE.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.100
- THANK YOU, MILES.

05:21.133 --> 05:24.433
WAGS HAS MADE MY DAY.
MY YEAR.

05:24.467 --> 05:26.333
- I'M JUST HAPPY
TO BE WANTED.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.567
all: AWWW!

05:31.567 --> 05:33.800
- MOM, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NOT FAIR?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.767
- THAT TAYLOR HAS A PET
AND YOU DON'T?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.567
- WOW. YOU'RE GOOD.
- HMM.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.067
- I HAD A WHOLE ARGUMENT HERE.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.300
SO, LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.800
WHEN AM I GETTING
MY GIRAFFE?

05:43.833 --> 05:46.633
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A GIRAFFE.

05:46.667 --> 05:49.200
- MOM, THEY MAKE
THE PERFECT PET.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.733
- FRANKIE, YOUR TRACK RECORD
WITH TAKING CARE OF PETS

05:51.767 --> 05:53.533
IS NOT SO HOT.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.367
REMEMBER
SAMMY THE SALAMANDER?

05:55.400 --> 05:59.200
- NO.
- BOTTOM OF MY SHOE DOES.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.867
LOOK, I HAD A FEELING
THIS CONVERSATION WAS COMING,

06:02.900 --> 06:05.500
WHICH IS WHY
I GOT YOU THIS.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.367
- THIS IS CLAMBY.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.700
HE'S A DIGITAL PET CLAM.

06:11.733 --> 06:14.133
IF YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

06:14.167 --> 06:16.300
THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.133
I'M HUNGRY!

06:18.167 --> 06:20.267
- YOU'RE UP.

06:20.300 --> 06:24.167
- OOH, YUMMY!
THANK YOU.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.467
- AW, CLAMBY,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:26.500 --> 06:30.100
YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.133
- NICE PET.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.300
NOT.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.167
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK

06:37.200 --> 06:38.533
THAT THING'S GONNA BE?

06:38.567 --> 06:41.500
"FEED ME!"
"BURP ME!"

06:41.533 --> 06:43.267
SPARE ME.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.233
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO IT.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.733
- NOT ME.

06:46.767 --> 06:49.100
NO SILLY PET COULD EVER
TIE ME DOWN.

06:49.133 --> 06:52.067
I LIKE TO KEEP IT REAL.
BE MY OWN MAN.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.767
FREE TO COME AND GO
AS I PLEASE.

06:56.233 --> 06:58.133
Ray: LOUIE!
GET YOUR BUTT UP HERE!

06:58.167 --> 06:59.667
YOU HAVE STUFF TO PUT AWAY!

06:59.700 --> 07:02.400
- AND I PLEASE TO GO
TO THE ATTIC RIGHT NOW.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.100
THIS IS--OH!

07:26.133 --> 07:28.100
THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED.

07:32.267 --> 07:35.833
- MILES, WAGS AND I HAVE BEEN
HAVING THE BEST DAY.

07:35.867 --> 07:39.733
SHOPPING, TALKING,
SHOPPING, WALKING, SHOPPING.

07:39.767 --> 07:43.367
AND WHAT WAS THE LAST THING?
OH, YEAH, SHOPPING.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.467
FUN TIMES, FUN TIMES.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
- DON'T YOU LOVE THE WAY
WAGS TALKS?

07:48.533 --> 07:50.233
AND HE'S A GREAT LISTENER.

07:50.267 --> 07:52.633
HE CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF MY GYMNASTICS STORIES.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.167
LIKE THE ONE
WHERE I TOOK STATE

07:54.200 --> 07:55.600
IN FLOOR EXERCISE
AFTER NAILING MY...

07:55.633 --> 07:57.700

07:57.733 --> 08:00.267
JINX!
BUY ME A SODA!

08:00.300 --> 08:03.700
WE PLAY THAT GAME A LOT.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.400
- MILES,
YOU'ALL OUT.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.067
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.067
- AH, PLEASE.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.100
IT'S NOT LIKE I DESERVE
AN AWARD OR ANYTHING.

08:14.133 --> 08:15.467
UNLESS YOU INSIST.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.133
HERE'S A PHONE NUMBER
TO A PLACE.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.067
- YOU'RE HILARIOUS.
- YES.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.400
I WAS TOTALLY JOKING.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.300
- OH, WAGS!

08:25.333 --> 08:27.300
WE SHOULD TRY ON THAT BERET
I BOUGHT YOU.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.733
IT'S GOING TO LOOK
SUPER CUTE.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.467
WHERE'D I PUT THAT?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.767

08:32.800 --> 08:35.800

08:35.833 --> 08:37.867
A BERET?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:37.900 --> 08:41.367
DO I LOOK LIKE
A FRENCH POODLE?

08:44.667 --> 08:47.667
YAP, YAP, YAP!

08:47.700 --> 08:49.633
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE, YA DUMB BIRD.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.733
TEENAGE GIRLS ARE UNBEARABLE!

08:52.767 --> 08:55.300
MALLS, BOYS, GYMNASTICS.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.367
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

08:58.400 --> 09:02.867
OH, YEAH, AND HERE'S WHAT
I THINK ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.533
OH, YEAH.

09:26.200 --> 09:31.100
- DID I HEAR
THAT ADORABLE LITTLE DOG?

09:31.133 --> 09:34.167
- NOPE.
IT'S JUST MY SWEET CLAMBY.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.500
- OH. TOO BAD.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.400
I WANT TO SAY HI
TO THE LITTLE FELLA.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.800
- AAH!

09:40.833 --> 09:44.400
IS THAT MAILMAN
EVER GONNA COME?

09:44.433 --> 09:49.100
IS HE DELIVERING
YOUR COURAGE?

09:49.133 --> 09:51.433
MMM.
LOOK AT YOU, FRANKIE.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.400
YOU'RE SUPER MOM.
HEH.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.133
WONDER WHO YOU GET THAT FROM?

09:55.167 --> 09:56.633
OH, MY GOSH!

09:56.667 --> 09:58.733
I TOTALLY FORGOT YOU HAVE
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.667
WE NEED TO HUSTLE.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.433
- BUT I DIDN'T EAT LUNCH YET.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.167
- I GOT A BREATH MINT
IN MY PURSE.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
RAY, DOOR, PLEASE!

10:09.900 --> 10:11.900
- MAKE WAY FOR SUPER MOM!

10:15.267 --> 10:18.233
- FEED ME!

10:26.133 --> 10:28.233
WHERE'S FRANKIE?

10:28.267 --> 10:30.800

NOT MY PROBLEM.

10:30.833 --> 10:34.233
I'M A LONE COWBOY.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.767
- FEED ME! FEED ME!

10:36.800 --> 10:39.733
FEED ME! FEED ME!
FEED ME!

10:39.767 --> 10:42.333
FINE!

10:42.367 --> 10:45.800

10:45.833 --> 10:48.467
- THANK YOU, MAMA.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.333
- I AM NOT YOUR MAMA.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.733
- SING TO ME, MAMA.

10:53.767 --> 10:56.067
- OH, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.667
I'M NOT SINGING TO A CLAM.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.633
I DON'T CARE HOW CUTE
YOUR VOICE IS.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.533
NOT HAPPENING!

11:01.567 --> 11:03.333
* LULLABY

11:03.367 --> 11:04.767

OH!

11:14.500 --> 11:17.433
OH, MY!

11:17.467 --> 11:20.333
LOOK WHO'S CARRYING OFF
A SMASHING BOWTIE.

11:20.367 --> 11:22.200
- OH. HEH! THANKS.

11:22.233 --> 11:25.533
IT'S ONE OF MY--
WAIT. DROP THE ACT.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.133
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
TO THE PEACOCK.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.633
FINE. YOU GOT ME.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.233
I NEEDED A PLACE TO CRASH.
YOU NEEDED A DOG.

11:32.267 --> 11:35.167
EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.567
I NEVER WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
TO TAYLOR

11:36.600 --> 11:38.100
IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU WERE A JERK.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.133
- UH, DUH!

11:39.167 --> 11:41.633
WHOA, WHOA, THERE SHE IS.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.200
- HEY, GUYS!
GOODNESS!

11:44.233 --> 11:46.600
ARE YOU BACK
WITH MY ADORABLE CAP ALREADY?

11:46.633 --> 11:48.133
- YOU HAVE TO
WEAR THIS TONIGHT.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.300
IT TOTALLY MATCHES MY DRESS.
- TWINSIES!

11:53.767 --> 11:56.600
- OH, GREAT.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.167
WAGS IS HERE.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.533
- HEY, GUYS.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.267
RAY, JUST ADMIT
YOU'RE SCARED OF DOGS.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.167
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.767
IF I WAS SCARED,
WOULD I PUT A HAT ON ONE?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.667
GIVE ME.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.700
HERE YOU GO.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.800
GOOD BOY.

12:16.833 --> 12:18.233
THIS IS FUN.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.467
- I SAW TEETH!

12:20.500 --> 12:23.267
- NO, NOT SCARED AT ALL.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.467
- LET'S PUT YOUR HAT ON
IN MY ROOM, WAGS.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.100
AND GUESS WHAT.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.767
I WANTED TO WAIT
AND SURPRISE YOU,

12:30.800 --> 12:33.733
BUT I ALSO BOUGHT YOU
A MATCHING TURTLENECK!

12:33.767 --> 12:36.633
DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

12:36.667 --> 12:40.200
BE THERE RIGHT AFTER
I USE THE LITTLE PUP'S ROOM.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.800
- GREAT. SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.133
MILES, IT'S BEEN
A REALLY LONG TIME SINCE

12:46.167 --> 12:48.267
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.767
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.
THANKS.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.833
audience: AWWW!

12:55.433 --> 12:57.767
- THAT WAS SWEET.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.100
ALL RIGHT,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.100
- I'M DONE.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.633
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.267
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.800
IT'LL RUIN HER BIRTHDAY.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.367
- THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, JACK.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.733
HERE, SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.467
- SO, TAYLOR,
THERE'S SOMETHING

13:23.500 --> 13:25.500
I NEED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT WAGS.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.100
- TAYLOR!

13:27.133 --> 13:28.300
OH--OH, MY GOSH.

13:28.333 --> 13:31.367
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
- THANKS.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.367
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.067
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE CELEBRATED

13:35.067 --> 13:37.067
MY BIRTHDAY IN THREE YEARS.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.400
WHERE'S WAGS?

13:38.433 --> 13:41.100
- UH, THE THING IS, UH,

13:41.133 --> 13:43.533
HE KINDA LEFT...

13:45.100 --> 13:46.533
- TO GET YOU A GIFT.

13:46.567 --> 13:47.733
- OH, MY GOD.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.400
DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.600
HE'S GETTING ME A GIFT?

13:51.633 --> 13:54.200
ISN'T HE JUST
THE SWEETEST DOG EVER?

13:54.233 --> 13:56.700
- HE'S SOMETHING.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.967
BUT LET'S REMEMBER,
TAYLOR,

13:59.067 --> 14:00.333
HE'S NOT THE ONLY PET
IN THE HOUSE

14:00.367 --> 14:01.733
YOU CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.300
- HE'S PRETTY LOVABLE TOO.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.633
- HE'S A FAKE STUFFED BIRD.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.533
- THAT RAPS.

14:14.567 --> 14:15.633
* MY NAME IS TOBY

14:15.667 --> 14:17.233
* HOW DO YOU DO?

14:17.267 --> 14:19.133
* I LIKE TO RAP
AND MY FEATHERS ARE BLUE *

14:19.167 --> 14:21.500
WORD.

14:21.533 --> 14:25.200
* SECOND VERSE
SAME AS THE FIRST-- *

14:25.233 --> 14:29.400
TAYLOR

14:29.433 --> 14:32.433
GOOD JOB, TOBY.

14:35.067 --> 14:37.633
- CLAMBY, I'M HOME.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.633
I'LL GIVE YOU DINNER
IN A MINUTE.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.667
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE DAY I HAD.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.967
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

14:49.067 --> 14:53.633
LOOK WHO FINALLY DECIDED
TO ACT LIKE A CARING PARENT.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.600
- I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU
ABANDONING CLAMBY

14:58.633 --> 15:01.267
FOR THE BETTER PART
OF THE AFTERNOON.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.100
- SORRY. JEEZ.

15:04.133 --> 15:08.067
- "SORRY" DOESN'T DRY THE TEARS
OF A LONELY CLAM.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.067
- HEY, I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.600
YOU THINK IT'S EASY TAKING CARE
OF HIM ALL BY MYSELF?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.733
I'M THE ONE FEEDING
AND CHANGING HIM

15:19.767 --> 15:23.433
WHILE YOU'RE OUT DOING
WHO KNOWS WHAT!

15:23.467 --> 15:24.733
- I HAD A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.400
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.333
- HEY, WASN'T IT CUTE

15:33.367 --> 15:35.267
WHEN HE BURPED
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.100
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.400
YOU WEREN'T AROUND!

15:39.433 --> 15:41.600
MY CLAM.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.200
MILES, I CAN'T HELP YOU.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.067
I HAVE A LOT
ON MY PLATE RIGHT NOW.

15:47.067 --> 15:50.233
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO HAVE KIDS.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.500
- YOU HAVE TO DO THIS
FOR ME.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.467
- I'M NOT GONNA TURN MYSELF INTO
THE FORM OF A DOG

15:54.500 --> 15:56.400
AND SHOW UP
TO TAYLOR'S PARTY.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.633
- NOT JUST ANY DOG.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.367
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE WAGS.
- NO.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.067
- I'LL GIVE YOU 40 BUCKS.

16:02.067 --> 16:05.733
- HELLO, GUV'NOR.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.333
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?

16:08.700 --> 16:10.067
I SAID A DOG!

16:12.367 --> 16:15.200
OH, MAN!

16:15.233 --> 16:17.067
YOU'RE STILL GONNA
PAY ME, RIGHT?

16:17.067 --> 16:20.067
THAT MONEY WAS FOR CLAMBY'S
COLLEGE FUND.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.500
- GUYS, MY PARTY'S STARTING.

16:22.533 --> 16:23.700
IS WAGS UP THERE?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.533
- UH, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.733
BE DOWN IN A SEC.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.600
WELL, I HAVE NO CHOICE.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:34.700 --> 16:36.067
CAN I FOOL HER?

16:37.333 --> 16:40.267
YOU LOOK STUPID.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.467
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

16:50.067 --> 16:53.067
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.167
- OR A FUN COASTER.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.100
- AND BY THE WAY,

17:07.133 --> 17:09.433
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SPENDING

17:09.467 --> 17:12.300
A RELAXING EVENING
IN YOUR PRESENCE,

17:12.333 --> 17:15.167
BECAUSE I FEAR NO BEAST.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.400
NO BEAST.

17:17.433 --> 17:20.433
- I SHOULD HOPE NOT, DAD--
UH, KIND SIR.

17:25.133 --> 17:28.133
- WOW. THIS BOOK
REALLY WORKS.

17:28.167 --> 17:30.367
LOOK, EVERYBODY,
I'M PETTIN' A DOG.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.300
TOMORROW I TAKE ON CLOWNS...

17:35.500 --> 17:40.267
WHICH DON'T KEEP ME
UP AT NIGHT AT ALL.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.100
- OH.

17:42.133 --> 17:43.700
UH, HE'LL BE ALONG ANY SEC.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.500
I'M SURE HE'D WANT YOU
TO KEEP GOING.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.167
PIP, PIP.
CHEESE AND CRACKERS.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.233
STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.433
- NO WAY. HE'S THE ONE
WHO PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.100
I'M GOING TO WAIT.

17:54.133 --> 17:58.600
- FINE. I'LL CHECK ON
THE OLD BOY, SHALL I?

17:58.633 --> 18:00.767
- LET'S ALL SIT FOR DINNER.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.300
- BURP ME.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.100
- I'M COMING, CLAMBY.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.567
- I'M COMING, CLAMBY.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.533
- HE WANTS HIS POPS.
- HE NEEDS HIS MOTHER.

18:13.433 --> 18:16.767
NO!
- MY BABY!

18:18.467 --> 18:19.667
- JUST TO CLARIFY--

18:19.700 --> 18:22.267
THAT'S A PLASTIC CLAM,
RIGHT?

18:22.300 --> 18:24.300
- LOUIE BROKE MY BABY.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.067
I WAS JUST
DOING MY DUTY.

18:27.067 --> 18:31.067
EXCUSE ME FOR BEING
THE HANDS-ON PARENT.

18:31.067 --> 18:34.267
- WOW. YOU TWO REALLY
CARE ABOUT CLAMBY.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.967
IT'S SWEET...

18:36.067 --> 18:37.700
AND A LITTLE WEIRD.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.200
- FIX ME.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.967
- DO SOMETHING, GRANNY.
- DON'T WORRY.

18:42.067 --> 18:43.100
WE'LL GET HIM
SOME FIRST AID.

18:43.133 --> 18:47.067
AND NEVER CALL ME GRANNY.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.367
- THERE'S THE BIRTHDAY GIRL.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.367
- OOH, MILES, JUST IN TIME
FOR THE TOAST.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.600
TO MY LOVELY DAUGHTER, WHO--

18:52.633 --> 18:54.333
- OH, WAIT.
WE NEED WAGS HERE.

18:54.367 --> 18:58.233
- OH, UH, WAGS SAID
TO START WITHOUT HIM,

18:58.267 --> 19:01.100
'CAUSE HE'S CHECKIN'
ON THE ROAST.

19:01.133 --> 19:02.667
- IT'S ON THE TABLE.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.067
I'LL GO GET HIM.
- STOP!

19:05.100 --> 19:06.733
I GOT THIS.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.633
SMASHING, SPLENDID,
FISH AND CHIPS.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.333
WHAT DID I MISS?
- GREAT.

19:10.367 --> 19:11.767
AND NOW WE NEED MILES.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.400
- HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

19:13.433 --> 19:16.333
- YEP, WE'RE ALL HERE.
- YAY.

19:16.367 --> 19:17.700
- YES, WE ARE.
BY THE WAY, MILES,

19:17.733 --> 19:20.133
HAVE I COMPLIMENTED
YOUR FAB BOW TIE?

19:22.767 --> 19:26.700
- HE SURE IS.
AND VERY BRITISH.

19:30.433 --> 19:34.067
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE BOTH
GETTING ALONG.

19:34.067 --> 19:37.067
- YEAH, I FEEL LIKE
I'VE KNOWN WAGS FOREVER.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.333
AND I FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT MILES.

19:39.367 --> 19:42.200
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.600
SON

19:47.633 --> 19:50.200
OH.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.467
UH, PRESENT TIME.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.067
HOW FUN ARE BIRTHDAYS?

19:53.067 --> 19:55.067
- WHOA!

19:55.067 --> 19:58.200
all: WHOA.

19:58.233 --> 20:01.233
- UH, MILES,
WHAT'S WITH THE TAIL?

20:01.267 --> 20:04.333
- AAH! OH, AAH.

20:04.367 --> 20:08.267
GOTCHA WITH THE OLD BIRTHDAY
DOG TAIL TRICK THING.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.000
UH, I'LL GO FIND WAGS.

20:12.767 --> 20:17.033
THINK, THINK, THINK.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.033
OH, NO, TAYLOR.

20:19.067 --> 20:20.700
UH, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME,

20:20.733 --> 20:24.100
'CAUSE WAGS IS TRAPPED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.367
- GHOSTS CAN'T GET TRAPPED
IN ELEVATORS.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.300
SO HE'S LYING?

20:30.333 --> 20:33.433
- MILES, I KNOW YOU WERE
PRETENDING TO BE WAGS.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.267
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.400
FINE.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.267
I GOT YOU
THE WORST PRESENT EVER.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.633
IT TURNS OUT
WAGS WAS A REAL JERK.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.533
HE LEFT.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.133
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD

20:46.167 --> 20:48.133
- HE WAS A BAD DOG.

20:48.167 --> 20:51.133
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU SOONER,
BUT I GOT SO CAUGHT UP

20:51.167 --> 20:53.000
IN TRYING TO GIVE YOU
THE PERFECT BIRTHDAY,

20:53.033 --> 20:55.700
I ENDED UP RUINING
ANOTHER ONE.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.200
- MILES, YOU DIDN'T
RUIN ANYTHING.

21:01.233 --> 21:03.200
- NO.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.500
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU,
I WOULD'VE SPENT MY BIRTHDAY

21:05.533 --> 21:07.533
ALONE IN MY ROOM,
DOING HOMEWORK.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.133
BUT INSTEAD,
I WENT SHOPPING,

21:10.167 --> 21:13.133
GOT A NEW DRESS,
CELEBRATED WITH MY FAMILY.

21:13.167 --> 21:17.100
- HUH. I GUESS YOU DID
DO ALL THAT STUFF, DIDN'T YOU?

21:17.133 --> 21:20.133
- AND, I GOT TO SEE YOU
WITH A TAIL,

21:20.167 --> 21:22.667
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY CUTE,
BY THE WAY.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.467
- OH!

21:25.500 --> 21:27.100
- THANKS, MILES.

21:27.133 --> 21:30.267
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TAYLOR.

21:38.200 --> 21:42.100
- TAYLOR, LOUIE AND I HAVE
COME TO A JOINT DECISION.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.100
SINCE YOU LOST YOUR PET,

21:44.133 --> 21:47.167
WE WANT YOU
TO HAVE CLAMBY.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.600
- BE GOOD TO HIM.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.267
SUPPORT THE HEAD.

21:55.300 --> 21:58.267
SUPPORT THE HEAD!

22:00.267 --> 22:01.467
- YOU'RE KINDA CUTE.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.100
- FORGET IT.

22:03.133 --> 22:04.167
I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.967
I'LL BUY YOU A GOLDFISH.

22:06.067 --> 22:08.133
DADDY'S BACK!
