WE MADE A BIG MOVE.

03:41.172 --> 03:42.241
WE TARGETED RYAN.

03:42.275 --> 03:43.379
HE'S OUT.

03:43.413 --> 03:46.034
I CAN'T COMPETE IN THE NEXT
H.O.H. SO SOMEONE FROM MY

03:46.068 --> 03:50.551
ALLIANCE HAS TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION.

03:50.586 --> 03:53.034
STAEM ROLL CITY HERE WE CAN.

YOU GET RID OF ME, AND THEN WHAT
HAPPENS?

04:03.172 --> 04:06.793
YOU GUYS ARE ALL GOING TO
CANNIBALIZE EACH OTHER.

04:06.827 --> 04:07.896
IT'S GOING TO BE BRUTAL.

04:07.931 --> 04:10.413
YOU WILL USE ME AS A PAWN AND
MIX IT UP.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.862
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK
SOME OF THAT UP.

04:12.896 --> 04:17.482
>> RYAN IS GONE, AND OBVIOUSLY,
I'M SUPER BUMMED ABOUT THAT.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.793
BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ME NOW IS
TO WIN H.O.H.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.758
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, YOU HAVE
TO TRY TO INGRAISHATE YOURSELF

04:22.793 --> 04:23.551
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

04:23.586 --> 04:24.827
MAYBE THAT WILL WORK.

04:24.862 --> 04:28.068
IT'S A WELL-OILED MACHINE, BUT
THEN I'M GONE, AND THEN YOU GUYS

04:28.103 --> 04:30.275
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT'S
VERY STRONG.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.620
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--
>> LET'S TAKE A MINUTE TO ENJOY

>> I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU NEED
TO USE ME AS I A PAWN, DO IT, TO

BRING SOMETHING UP.

04:39.068 --> 04:40.344
>> OKAY.

04:40.379 --> 04:43.413
WE PULLED IT PAWCH WE BACKDOORED
RYAN, 12-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST.

04:43.448 --> 04:45.344
>> WILD, WILD.

04:45.379 --> 04:46.482
THIS GAME IS BRUTAL.

04:46.517 --> 04:49.448
>> ALL MY ALLIANCE NEEDS TO DO
NOW IS WIN H.O.H.

04:49.482 --> 04:50.620
HOPEFULLY, IT'S ME.

04:50.655 --> 04:53.034
I WANT TO BE H.O.H.

04:53.068 --> 04:54.793
>> I'M NEXT, I'M SURE.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.241
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

04:56.275 --> 04:57.551
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

04:57.586 --> 05:03.517
YOU KNOW?

05:09.034 --> 05:10.034
>> NO, YOU DID NOT.

05:10.068 --> 05:15.379
>> BUT, IT'S LIKE, THIS TEAM
TOOK ME IN.

05:15.413 --> 05:18.068
IT'S LIKE--
>> I KNOW,.

05:18.103 --> 05:19.068
>> HE WOULDN'T TAKE ME.

05:19.103 --> 05:20.862
>> I KNOW.

05:20.896 --> 05:23.344
>> I'M SORRY.

05:23.379 --> 05:31.000
SO YOU KNOW FROM I'M COMING FROM
BUT I JUST FEEL LUKE A TRAITOR

05:31.034 --> 05:31.551
NOW.

05:31.586 --> 05:32.724
BUT YOU SAW, I TRIELD.

05:32.758 --> 05:33.965
I'LL BE FINE.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.206
I JUST GOT GATE THIS OUT.

05:35.241 --> 05:38.275
>> YEAH.

05:38.310 --> 05:40.896
>> IT'S CRAZY.

05:40.931 --> 05:43.482
WHEN-- HE'S THE ONE THAT, LIKE,
HELPED ME THROUGH THAT NIGHT

05:43.517 --> 05:45.034
WHEN I WAS, LIKE, SO CRUSHED.

05:45.068 --> 05:47.931
>> AND HE WILL DO THE SAME THING
AT THE NEXT OLYMPICS BECAUSE

05:47.965 --> 05:48.724
THAT'S HOW RYAN IS.

05:48.758 --> 05:49.965
>> HE'S JUST A GOOD GUY.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.551
>> HE'S A GOOD DUDE.

05:51.586 --> 05:52.310
HE'S SOILED.

05:52.344 --> 05:54.000
HENCE, WHY WE HAD TO GET HIM
OUT.

05:54.034 --> 05:55.620
>> IT'S HEARTBROKEN.

05:55.655 --> 05:59.793
IT'S VERY HARD AS AN OLYMPIAN TO
VOTE ANOTHER OLYMPIAN TO BE OUT.

05:59.827 --> 06:04.068
LIKE... I WOULD NEVER HAVE
IMAGINED I WOULD DO THAT.

06:04.103 --> 06:08.000
BUT I WANTED A TEAM THAT I COULD
WORK WITH, THAT I WAS AN EQUAL

06:08.034 --> 06:11.413
PARTNERSHIP WITH, AND I NEVER
HAD THAT WITH RYAN, NEVER HAD IT

06:11.448 --> 06:12.206
WITH HIM.

06:12.241 --> 06:15.482
>> I LOVE RYAN, BUT HE HAD TO
GO.

06:15.517 --> 06:16.862
HE AIN'T GOOD FOR THE GAME.

06:16.896 --> 06:21.344
>> NO, HE'S TOO GOOD.

06:21.379 --> 06:23.241
>> UNLESS I WIN H.O.H., I'M
DEFINITELY NEXT.

06:23.275 --> 06:24.448
>> BUT NOT NECESSARILY.

06:24.482 --> 06:25.034
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.689
>> THINGS CHANGE.

06:26.724 --> 06:29.586
YOU GET IN POWER, THINGS CHANGE.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.344
>> IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT.

06:31.379 --> 06:32.517
BUT MAYBE I'M WRONG.

06:32.551 --> 06:37.103
AT SOME POINT YOU WILL HAVE TO
DO A LITTLE SHOCK AND AWE.

06:37.137 --> 06:40.103
NATALIE AND LOLO FEEL LIKE THEY
GOT IT LOCKED DOWN.

06:40.137 --> 06:40.931
THEY'RE SO SECURE.

06:40.965 --> 06:41.965
>> THEY ARE.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.620
>> I DON'T LIKE OVERCONFIDENCE,
I DON'T LIKE IT.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.000
AND IT'S VERY COMFORT.

06:46.034 --> 06:48.448
>> I'M COOL WITH BOTH NATALIE
AND LOLO.

06:48.482 --> 06:49.551
I DON'T MIND.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.586
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, SON.

06:51.620 --> 06:57.551
>> WHOA!

06:57.586 --> 07:00.482
>> I'M SO GLAD I'M OFF THE
BLOCK.

07:00.517 --> 07:01.344
>> OH, MY GOD!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.689
>> THAT WAS HORRIFYING!

07:02.724 --> 07:05.172
>> YOU OKAY, JO?

07:05.206 --> 07:09.310
>> I KNEW IT.

07:09.344 --> 07:14.206
>> THAT IS LIKE THIS, DUDE.

07:14.241 --> 07:16.586
THEY'RE GOING TO CANNIBALIZE
EVERYTHING UNTIL THEY'RE THE

07:16.620 --> 07:17.000
FINAL ONE.

07:17.034 --> 07:19.965
I KNOW IT.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.793
THIS WILL BALANCE THAT.

07:21.827 --> 07:23.068
RIGHT HERE.

07:23.103 --> 07:26.862
RIGHT NOW, IF WE HAVE FOUR, WE
WALK OUT OF HERE, KNOWING WE GOT

07:26.896 --> 07:28.379
EACH OTHERS' BACK.

07:28.413 --> 07:31.000
RIGHT NOW, I'M FEELING LIKE THE
STRONGEST ALLIANCE IN THE HOUSE

07:31.034 --> 07:33.482
IS TOM,ICATE OH, NATALIE, LOLO.

07:33.517 --> 07:37.413
MY FEELING IS IF I CAN GET DINA,
TAMAR, AND KANDI ON BOARD, THAT

07:37.448 --> 07:38.655
WILL BE FOUR OF US.

07:38.689 --> 07:43.034
AND WE THEN ONLY TRULY HAVE TO
WORK ON PICKING ONE OFF, WHICH

07:43.068 --> 07:49.344
WILL THEN GIVE US THE NUMBERS.

07:49.379 --> 07:57.000
>> YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ALLIANCE
WITH ME, KANDI-- WHO CAN DO

07:57.034 --> 08:01.896
NOTHING PHYSICAL-- AND DINA
AGAINST THE BOOTLEG SUPERHERO?

08:01.931 --> 08:03.517
NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.137
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE.

08:04.172 --> 08:05.413
>> I'M DOWN.

08:05.448 --> 08:16.586
>> BUT I STILL NEED TO WIN THIS
H.O.H. TO MAKE SURE I'M SAFE.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.034
>> YOU KNOW WHO I'M WORRIED
ABOUT?

08:19.068 --> 08:20.000
>> JOEY FOR SURE.

08:20.034 --> 08:23.000
>> OH, SHE'S SO BOTHERED.

08:23.034 --> 08:24.034
WE NEED TO WIN H.O.H.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.344
>> I KNOW.

08:25.379 --> 08:34.034
>> IF HE WINS OR DINA, KANDI, OR
TAY, I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY WOULD

08:34.068 --> 08:34.931
PUT UP.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.482
I FEEL LIKE THEY WOULD PUT UP ME
AND YOU.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.758
>> PROBABLY.

08:39.793 --> 08:42.655
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING
THINKS WE'RE BEHIND THIS.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.137
>> ME, YOU, OR TOM HAS TO WIN
IT.

08:45.172 --> 08:46.551
>> KNOCK-KNOCK.

08:46.586 --> 08:49.206

08:51.068 --> 08:52.310
>> YEAH.

08:52.344 --> 08:57.793
>> IT'S SO BANANAS TO ME BECAUSE
THAT WAS THE SECOND EVICTION.

08:57.827 --> 08:59.310
>> AND FEEL LIKE WE'VE HAD
SEVEN.

08:59.344 --> 09:00.413
>> THAT WAS EMOTIONAL, MAN.

09:00.448 --> 09:01.448
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS.

09:01.482 --> 09:02.689
>> IT GETS REAL IN THE HOUSE.

09:02.724 --> 09:03.827
>> YEAH.

09:03.862 --> 09:08.172
>> JOEY SAID YOU GUYS ARE
WALKING AROUND TOO COMFORT.

09:08.206 --> 09:10.034
CONFIDENT.

09:10.068 --> 09:11.034

09:11.068 --> 09:11.448
>> YEAH.

09:11.482 --> 09:12.241
>> THE GIRLS.

09:12.275 --> 09:14.034
>> YEAH.

09:14.068 --> 09:17.241
I DECIDED TO TELL NATALIE AND
LOLO WHAT JOEY SAID ABOUT THEM

09:17.275 --> 09:21.068
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT BY GIVING
THEM MORE INFORMATION, THEY'LL

09:21.103 --> 09:22.310
TRUST ME EVEN MORE.

09:22.344 --> 09:25.724
>> HE REALLY SAID THE GIRLS ARE
WALKING AROUND TOO COMFORT.

09:25.758 --> 09:28.034
WHAT THE [BLEEP] DOES HE WANT US
TO DO?

09:28.068 --> 09:32.793
ALL THIS DOES IS FUEL MY FIRE TO
SEND JOEY HOME PACKING.

09:32.827 --> 09:34.206
THAT IS SO STUPID.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.275
TAKE A... SEAT.

09:41.137 --> 09:42.551

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
SO IF YOU GET NOMINATED AT THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY OR VETO

37:22.034 --> 37:24.862
MEETING, YOU CAN USE THIS POWER
TO PULL YOURSELF OFF THE

37:24.896 --> 37:28.965
CHOPPING BLOCK, KEEPING YOURSELF
SAFE AT THE NEXT EVICTION.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.862
THIS POWER CAN ONLY BE USED
ONCE, AND IT EXPIRES AFTER THE

37:31.896 --> 37:33.931
VETO MEETING ON FEBRUARY 4.

37:33.965 --> 37:37.000
FROM THAT POINT ON, IT IS NO
LONGER IN PLAY.

37:37.034 --> 37:41.379
CONGRATULATIONS, AGAIN, AND GOOD
LUCK."

37:41.413 --> 37:42.586
THANK YOU, AMERICA!

37:42.620 --> 37:47.206
I NEEDED THIS BECAUSE I'M
PROBABLY GOING ON THE BLOCK THIS

37:47.241 --> 37:47.931
WEEK.

37:47.965 --> 37:57.206
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

37:57.241 --> 37:59.068
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

37:59.103 --> 38:02.206
>> TOM, TOM, I'M NOT GOING TO DO
THE I.P.A.s.

38:02.241 --> 38:03.206
IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE?

38:03.241 --> 38:06.689
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

38:06.724 --> 38:09.724
>> WHO'S GOT THE POWER?

38:09.758 --> 38:12.275
>> I THINK KANDI HAS IT.

38:12.310 --> 38:13.448
OR TAMAR.

38:13.482 --> 38:19.586
>> THE PERSON WHO IS IN THE
STICKIEST SITUATION IS JOEY.

38:19.620 --> 38:24.758
>> SO IF I PUT UP THE TWO PEOPLE
ON THE BLOCK THAT WE THINK ARE

38:24.793 --> 38:27.620
MOST LIKELY TO HAVE TTHEY WILL
PULL THEMSELVES OFF RIGHT AWAY.

38:27.655 --> 38:29.689
THEY IMMEDIATELY STAND UP AND
SAY THEY'VE GOT THE POWER.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.931
>> EXACTLY.

38:30.965 --> 38:36.965
BUT IF YOU PUT THEM UP NOW, AND
THEN I IT GETS FLUSHED OUT.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.275
>> THIS TWIST IS REALLY MESSING
WITH MY H.O.H.!

38:40.310 --> 38:42.827
BUT I STILL WANT TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE THIS WEEK.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.344
NOW I HAVE TO DECIDE IF I WANT
TO GO AFTER THE PERSON WHO I

38:45.379 --> 38:50.758
THINK HAS THE POWER...

38:50.793 --> 38:57.000
OR GO AFTER ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE
A BIG THREAT IN THE HOUSE.

38:57.034 --> 38:57.896
AND WHO KNOWS?

38:57.931 --> 39:02.931
MAYBE THE BIG THREAT ALSO HAS
THE POWER.

39:15.448 --> 39:29.931
>> EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:29.965 --> 39:36.000
♪ ♪
>> THIS IS THE NOMINATION

39:44.827 --> 39:46.000
CEREMONY.

39:46.034 --> 39:50.241
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE TWO

39:50.275 --> 39:53.862
HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

39:53.896 --> 39:57.379
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCKS ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUESTS I'M

39:57.413 --> 39:59.448
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

39:59.482 --> 40:02.448
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
THE NOMINATIONS, AND THEIR FACES

40:02.482 --> 40:04.793
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

40:04.827 --> 40:19.517
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS... THE NEXT

40:19.551 --> 40:27.758
HOUSEGUEST I HAVE NOMINATED
IS...

40:27.793 --> 40:29.758
>> AH!

40:29.793 --> 40:32.931
>> NO MORE FRIED CHICKEN FOR
YOU!

40:32.965 --> 40:36.827
>> I NOMINATED YOU, JOE, YOU AND
YOU, KANDI.

40:36.862 --> 40:40.689
I LIKE YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

40:40.724 --> 40:46.034
BUT WHEN THE CELEBRITY BREAKING
NEWS HAPPENED, MY GUT TOLD ME

40:46.068 --> 40:48.103
THAT IT WAS ONE OF YOU.

40:48.137 --> 40:54.379
AND SO I'M PUTTING YOU UP FOR
NOMINATION TO SEE IF I WAS

40:54.413 --> 40:55.586
RIGHT.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.068
HOPEFULLY, I HAVEN'T PUT EITHER
OF YOU IN TOO STICKY OF A

40:59.103 --> 40:59.379
SITUATION.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.448
>> WOW.

41:00.482 --> 41:08.620
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

41:08.655 --> 41:13.862
>> I NOMINATED KANDI AND JOEY
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY HAD THE

41:13.896 --> 41:14.689
POWER.

41:14.724 --> 41:16.000
BUT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE
POWER.

41:16.034 --> 41:18.896
AT LEAST WE STILL GOT A VETO TO
PLAY.

41:18.931 --> 41:22.551
IF THE STARS ALIGN AND I GET TO
BACKDOOR SOMEONE THIS WEEK,

41:22.586 --> 41:28.172
RICKY, YOU'RE VERY MUCH ON MY
RADAR.

41:28.206 --> 41:32.137
>> SO I'M PUT ON THE BLOCK WHICH
IS-- WHICH IS NOT A SHOCK.

41:32.172 --> 41:35.551
TOM, YOU'RE ALMOST TOO
PREDICTABLE, MAN.

41:35.586 --> 41:38.965
SO NOW IT'S UP TO THE VETO, AND
THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY DO

41:39.000 --> 41:40.172
NEED TO WIN.

41:40.206 --> 41:44.275
OTHERWISE, MY GUT TELLS ME I'M
GOING TO BE FOLLOWING MY BOY

41:44.310 --> 41:45.517
RYAN OUT THE DOOR.

41:45.551 --> 41:49.379
>> SO MY DEAR OLD FRIEND, TOM,
PUT ME ON THE BLOCK BECAUSE HE

41:49.413 --> 41:51.620
SAYS HE THINKS I HAVE THE POWER.

41:51.655 --> 41:52.586
REALLY, TOM?

41:52.620 --> 41:55.517
THAT WAS A STUPID REASON TO PUT
SOMEBODY UP.

41:55.551 --> 42:00.275
I'M OVER IT, AND I'M DEFINITELY
OVER TOM.

42:00.310 --> 42:04.724
>> TOM NOMINATES KANDI AND JOEY,
OUR FIVE ARE SAFE, AND

42:04.758 --> 42:07.413
EVERYTHING IS GOING AS PLANNED.

42:07.448 --> 42:09.965
JOEY'S ON THE BLOCK, AND
HOPEFULLY THIS WEEK, WE CAN GET

42:10.000 --> 42:12.172
HIM OUT OF HERE ONCE AND FOR
ALL.

42:12.206 --> 42:15.206
>> I GOT THE POWER!

42:15.241 --> 42:17.034
AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO USE
IT.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.344
THANK YOU, AMERICA!

42:19.379 --> 42:20.620
MWAH!

42:20.655 --> 42:21.344
MWAH!

42:21.379 --> 42:22.586
I'M GOING TO PUT IT TO GOOD USE.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.103
I PROMISE.

42:23.137 --> 42:24.517
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

42:24.551 --> 42:27.758
>> WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO?

42:27.793 --> 42:31.517
AND WILL IT SAVE KANDI OR JOEY
FROM THE CHOPPING BLOCK?

42:31.551 --> 42:34.586
PLUS, WHO WILL BE THE NEXT
CELEBRITY EVICTED FROM THE

42:34.620 --> 42:36.103
HOUSE?

42:36.137 --> 42:41.275
