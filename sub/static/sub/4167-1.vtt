<i>Here we go.</i>

00:10.544 --> 00:13.339
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

00:13.422 --> 00:16.008
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

00:16.091 --> 00:18.719
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

00:18.803 --> 00:21.138
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

00:21.222 --> 00:23.974
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

00:24.058 --> 00:26.769
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

00:26.852 --> 00:29.688
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

00:29.772 --> 00:33.150
<i># They all look just the same</i>

00:33.234 --> 00:36.153
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

00:36.237 --> 00:38.948
<i># All went to the university</i>

00:39.031 --> 00:41.742
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

00:41.826 --> 00:44.078
<i># They came out the same</i>

00:44.161 --> 00:47.123
<i># There's doctors and lawyers</i>

00:47.206 --> 00:49.667
<i># And business executives</i>

00:49.750 --> 00:52.628
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

00:52.711 --> 00:55.589
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

00:59.593 --> 01:01.011
<i>Previously on Weeds.</i>

01:01.095 --> 01:03.431
Our stash is worth about 300 G,

01:03.514 --> 01:06.851
but the market's making the bull run,
so we should know half a mil easy.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.060
Ahh!

01:08.853 --> 01:12.273
- I'm having an affair with Doug.
- Doug Wilson?

01:12.356 --> 01:13.816
Wife-fucker.

01:15.317 --> 01:17.236
Shane's graduation. I can't do this.

01:17.319 --> 01:19.530
You have failed us all!

01:19.613 --> 01:22.450
And some fucking lowlife
stole two of them already.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.869
- The cameras?
- And the "Drug Free Zone" signs,

01:24.952 --> 01:28.247
and the Sasquatch costume. Son of a bitch.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.332
- Hi, Kat.
- Hi.

01:30.416 --> 01:33.294
- Abumchuk!
- He's just this bounty hunter.

01:33.377 --> 01:35.463
I did something illegal.

01:35.546 --> 01:38.132
- It's now or never, come with me.
- I'm not coming with you.

01:38.841 --> 01:41.135
- Thanks for keeping me company.
- Where are we going?

01:41.218 --> 01:43.095
- Where do you wanna go?
- Pittsburgh!

01:43.971 --> 01:46.515
- Step on it, Geronimo.
- You watch that shit, man.

01:46.599 --> 01:49.310
Have you been fucking him all the time
you were married to me?

01:49.393 --> 01:52.188
It's just business between us.
Always has been.

01:52.354 --> 01:56.275
Take your last harvest, make a quick deal,
and then hand all the cash over to me.

01:56.358 --> 01:57.526
Why are you doing this?

01:57.610 --> 02:01.363
Because I laid everything on the line
for you, and you fucked me.

02:01.447 --> 02:03.783
I'm looking to sell
about 38 pounds of sexy mama.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.035
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'll take it.

02:06.952 --> 02:07.953
What the fuck?

02:08.037 --> 02:09.955
Now give us the drugs,
and we'll let you live.

02:10.038 --> 02:11.457
Kesheshian says "Goodbye. "

02:11.540 --> 02:13.793
- Where's the money?
- Ain't no money, fool!

02:14.251 --> 02:15.961
- Wait...
- Where is my money?

02:16.045 --> 02:18.255
- I kill agent asshole, you pay us.
- He's dead?

02:18.339 --> 02:20.508
There ain't no money,
cos they decided to jack us.

02:20.591 --> 02:21.759
- Peter.
- We kill each other, then

02:21.842 --> 02:23.594
- nobody gets nothing!
- He's dead?

02:23.677 --> 02:24.720
- Yes!
- Yes!

02:24.804 --> 02:25.888
OK.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.307
- Open the fucking safe!
- Open the fucking safe!

02:28.390 --> 02:29.642
Open the fucking safe!

02:29.725 --> 02:32.895
Sorry. There's a lot
of data flying around.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.148
Oh, not today.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.734
Hi, Nancy!

02:38.818 --> 02:41.237
Did you take something
that doesn't belong to you?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.446
I want in.

02:43.656 --> 02:45.491
- That's him.
- Shit.

02:45.574 --> 02:46.951
Bitch, you about to die.

03:11.767 --> 03:13.060
I don't know about this, hon.

03:13.144 --> 03:16.021
God knows
what they've done with the inside.

03:16.105 --> 03:19.150
It might upset you.
Your mother kept that place so clean.

03:20.109 --> 03:22.736
This used to be all flowers
and nice lawns...

03:22.820 --> 03:26.824
- Can we go to City Walk now?
... nice families. Now look at it.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.701
I gotta go pee.

03:28.784 --> 03:31.912
- Oh, she's gotta go pee.
- I'm gonna pee in my pants.

03:31.996 --> 03:33.831
You hold it! There it is.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.875
I'm gonna ask if
she can pee in the house.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.254
- Hello?
- Can't hold it.

03:40.337 --> 03:41.797
Ellie! Ellie!

03:43.048 --> 03:45.468
Look at how they changed the wallpaper.

03:45.551 --> 03:47.344
Hello?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.472
I'm Dawn Trimigliosi.

03:49.555 --> 03:52.683
I used to live here
when I was a little girl. Hello?

03:53.517 --> 03:56.020
We're visiting from Scottsdale.

03:56.645 --> 03:59.648
- Mommy?
- I think she had an accident.

04:06.864 --> 04:08.282
Erm...

04:08.365 --> 04:12.078
...sorry about this, we were just...
- You used to live here?

04:13.245 --> 04:16.791
- My wife did.
- Dawn Trimigliosi, from Scottsdale.

04:17.374 --> 04:19.793
Yeah, I got a cousin in Scottsdale.

04:19.877 --> 04:21.670
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

04:21.754 --> 04:23.672
You know a dude named Cold Blood?

04:23.756 --> 04:27.676
About 6'5", 320,
big scar across his throat.

04:27.927 --> 04:31.889
Maybe I have him look you up.
You can go get nachos together.

04:33.182 --> 04:35.017
You know, hon, it's...

04:35.101 --> 04:36.685
...too bad.

04:36.894 --> 04:39.855
No one was home
when we went to your old place

04:39.939 --> 04:41.607
and we just had to...

04:41.690 --> 04:44.276
drive away without going in at all.

04:44.902 --> 04:46.028
What?

04:47.404 --> 04:49.073
Oh, right, we...

04:49.615 --> 04:52.868
- We went straight to City Walk.
- They got bowling at City Walk.

04:52.952 --> 04:56.997
And that's what we're doing, right now.
We're bowling, OK?

04:58.624 --> 05:00.292
I got kids here.

05:03.963 --> 05:07.216
Y'all go on and hit that reset button.

05:07.299 --> 05:08.843
Let's go, let's go.

05:08.926 --> 05:11.679
Go, go, go, go, go,
now, quick, move, come on!

05:11.762 --> 05:13.639
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:16.225 --> 05:17.309
Oohh!

05:17.393 --> 05:19.270
Can we all talk without the guns, please?

05:19.353 --> 05:22.106
- My arms are getting tired.
- So, rest them, by all means.

05:22.189 --> 05:26.652
Marvin, if you put that gun down,
I swear I'll shoot you myself, you fat fuck.

05:27.403 --> 05:30.990
Can I just make one more call
in the service of finding our pot?

05:31.073 --> 05:32.825
- Our pot!
- Fuck you!

05:32.908 --> 05:36.454
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

05:36.537 --> 05:38.831
- You fuck you!
- Whoa, hold up!

05:38.914 --> 05:40.374
Let's all just chill, all right?

05:40.458 --> 05:43.294
If she don't find the pot,
ain't nobody getting shit!

05:43.377 --> 05:45.671
That's not true.
You'll be getting a bullet.

05:45.755 --> 05:47.631
Mm-hm.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.884
Nancy, make your call.

05:58.350 --> 06:00.770
Shit. I can't get a signal.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.859
That's the little fucker
who stole my cameras.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.319
Arrest him!

06:08.402 --> 06:10.070
I didn't do anything.

06:10.696 --> 06:14.617
I have you on tape.
Like I wouldn't make copies?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.160
I didn't do shit!

06:16.243 --> 06:19.789
- A lot of people look like me.
- What are you waiting for?

06:19.872 --> 06:22.208
Search his car,
hit him with your flashlight.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.794
- Do what you people do.
- I did it.

06:25.544 --> 06:26.962
- See?
- I stole her cameras,

06:27.046 --> 06:29.381
- They're at my house, let's just go.
- Take him in.

06:29.465 --> 06:31.050
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.136
I can't give you a ride
with a suspect in the back of the vehicle.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.014
- It's policy.
- So, what am I supposed to do?

06:37.098 --> 06:38.516
Hike home?

06:38.933 --> 06:40.017
I'm in heels, here.

06:40.101 --> 06:42.520
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I'm just doing what we do.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.022
Cute. Right.

06:45.106 --> 06:47.149
Well, what's happening with his car?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.526
Yeah, hey, can I...

06:48.609 --> 06:51.487
Let me just lock it up real quick.
I'll have my mom come get it later.

06:51.570 --> 06:54.490
No, I'll have to call it in for towing.
This is a restricted parking area.

06:54.573 --> 06:56.784
OK, this is ridiculous.
Silas, give me your keys.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.370
- I will drive your car home.
- Absolutely not, no way.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.248
It's over 400 bucks
to get your vehicle out of the impound lot.

07:02.331 --> 07:03.874
Now, give her your keys.

07:03.958 --> 07:05.418
It's my car.

07:06.001 --> 07:09.088
- Hey, what the hell, you can't do that.
- Oh, yes, he can.

07:09.171 --> 07:13.551
Because you have no rights,
you thieving little shit.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.095
Son,

07:16.178 --> 07:19.390
get in the back of my vehicle right now.
Let's go, come on.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.892
It's done. Let's go. Come on.

07:25.980 --> 07:29.066
I'm just trying to find
some power bars, OK?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.110
Power bars, that can't be right.

07:31.193 --> 07:32.695
What do you call these?

07:32.778 --> 07:34.405
Bars of reception?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.991
On my phone,
I call it the shrinking pyramid.

07:37.074 --> 07:38.701
Kind of like your dick.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.579
Hey, man, that's not cool.
We don't even know these people.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.166
Oh, bars, bars, bars, got it. Here we go.
Please don't shoot me.

07:52.548 --> 07:53.883
Hey, Nancy.

07:53.966 --> 07:56.677
<i>Surprise, it's me, Celia.</i>

07:56.761 --> 07:59.013
OK, but I didn't... I didn't call you.

07:59.096 --> 08:03.684
No, you meant to call Silas,
but, you know, he's not here right now.

08:04.226 --> 08:08.814
I had him arrested,
and he admitted taking my cameras.

08:08.898 --> 08:12.276
You can probably reach him
at the Agrestic Police Station,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.320
if they're letting him take calls.

08:14.403 --> 08:18.032
Oh, and you know, Nance,
you're gonna have to reimburse me

08:18.115 --> 08:20.159
for gas money, because...

08:20.242 --> 08:25.081
...your irresponsible adolescent
has left me with an empty tank and... Hello?

08:25.790 --> 08:27.833
- We gotta go.
- Like hell.

08:28.751 --> 08:31.712
Hello, Nancy? Rude!

08:32.087 --> 08:33.380
As usual.

08:33.464 --> 08:37.342
Where is the fucking gas pop-up thing?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.222
Fuck.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.933
Where are we going?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.102
I know where the pot is,

08:46.185 --> 08:49.605
and if you let us go get it,
we'll bring it right back, I swear.

08:51.315 --> 08:52.775
Guns on me.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.152
- I stay.
- What?

08:56.278 --> 08:59.073
Oh, because you wouldn't know
that we're coming back, I got it.

09:09.875 --> 09:13.712
- OK, Vasag will go with you.
- Marvin, you're up. Go.

09:14.338 --> 09:17.007
If y'all not back with the broccoli
by dark,

09:17.091 --> 09:19.885
I'm shooting your boy here... in the nuts.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.930
And I will shoot him
in the kneecap and the elbow.

09:23.013 --> 09:25.558
And so on, so you better get moving.

09:33.566 --> 09:37.653
I forgot my purse. Sorry. Be back soon.
Oh, no shooting, OK?

09:41.157 --> 09:45.953
He's 12, brown hair, brown eyes,
he's wearing a beige suit, blue shirt.

09:46.412 --> 09:50.708
Hey... If you find him,
could you just call me?

09:50.791 --> 09:53.085
We had to sedate his mother.

09:53.169 --> 09:55.296
Yes, yes, very upsetting.

09:56.380 --> 10:00.176
You have my cell number?
Thank you. Thank you, bye.

10:00.259 --> 10:04.221
I'm telling you, man,
after a lifetime of sardines and blubber,

10:04.305 --> 10:07.391
a fast-food burrito
ain't gonna be kind to you.

10:07.475 --> 10:10.311
You called the fucking cops, didn't you?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.355
He's my nephew.
I called in an AMBER Alert.

10:13.439 --> 10:16.650
If the police find him first,
and you fucked up my bounty,

10:16.734 --> 10:18.986
I'm wiping my ass with you.

10:26.327 --> 10:27.870
Ah!

10:28.245 --> 10:32.458
Hey, is this the truck version
of setting me adrift on an ice floe?

10:40.758 --> 10:45.054
Shane, this is Bear.
We met over there by the candy machine,

10:45.179 --> 10:49.600
and he showed me that the lid
to the mini-mint patties was loose. Look.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.647
Mm, that's yummy.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.565
So, listen, little guy.

10:56.649 --> 11:01.695
I am going to hitch a ride
to South America with Bear,

11:01.779 --> 11:04.782
but I'm gonna leave you the van,
so you can go...

11:04.865 --> 11:08.244
home, or to Pittsburgh,
or wherever you wanna go, OK?

11:08.327 --> 11:10.538
- I'm 12.
- I was driving at eight.

11:10.621 --> 11:12.581
Don't make him feel bad, Bear.

11:12.665 --> 11:16.961
OK, after you finish your sandwich,
go to the big parking lot out back

11:17.044 --> 11:20.172
and practice driving around a little bit
until you feel comfortable.

11:20.256 --> 11:22.383
I'm sure you'll get the hang of it
really quickly.

11:22.466 --> 11:25.344
- Can you show me how?
- I'm sorry, kid, I'm on a tight schedule.

11:25.428 --> 11:29.557
Yeah, he's on a really tight schedule
and, you know, he's doing me the favour,

11:29.640 --> 11:32.143
so, when he says go, I gotta go.

11:32.226 --> 11:35.938
<i>And I said go half an hour ago,
so chop-chop. Tempus fugit.</i>

11:36.021 --> 11:38.732
Oh, my God, you speak Greek.
How cute is that?

11:38.816 --> 11:44.029
<i>It's Latin, and the actual quotation is,
Fugit irreparabile tempus,</i>

11:44.113 --> 11:47.450
which means, irretrievable time is flying.

11:47.533 --> 11:49.785
Well, fuck me with a dictionary, kid.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.412
Get beat up much?

11:51.495 --> 11:53.789
OK. Honey, honey...

11:54.457 --> 11:55.791
sit down.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.544
I know that this must be rough,

11:58.627 --> 12:03.174
but I think that you can use this
as an opportunity to explore

12:03.257 --> 12:07.845
and to grow and to learn that you should
always keep an up-to-date passport

12:07.928 --> 12:09.388
on your person at all times.

12:09.472 --> 12:12.558
So, here are the keys to the van.

12:12.641 --> 12:15.102
Here's about $13 in change

12:15.186 --> 12:18.230
that I liberated from
the tampon machine in the ladies' room.

12:18.314 --> 12:21.776
I want you to have it.
Have amazing adventures, Shane.

12:21.859 --> 12:25.863
We'll meet again.
I'll be older, but I'll still be hot.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.364
And you'll be older,

12:27.448 --> 12:32.286
and you'll still be the same, smart,
wise, gentle soul that you are now,

12:32.369 --> 12:33.996
but you'll be taller.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.581
And I think that you're gonna do

12:35.664 --> 12:38.417
some really interesting things
with your facial hair.

12:38.501 --> 12:40.169
I just see it.

12:40.252 --> 12:43.756
OK, sweetie? Heart hug, heart hug.

12:44.548 --> 12:48.719
OK? Be well. I think you're amazing.

12:49.845 --> 12:50.971
Bye.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.811
Man, this is a fucking police station.

12:56.894 --> 12:59.605
I told you, there's a guy in there
who knows where the pot is.

12:59.688 --> 13:02.650
I'm just gonna go talk to him and leave.
OK?

13:02.733 --> 13:04.777
And who is this guy?
He a cop or something?

13:04.860 --> 13:08.447
No, he's a criminal, just like us.
It's gonna be fine.

13:08.531 --> 13:10.366
You pull any shit up in there,

13:10.449 --> 13:13.536
we kill you and we kill
your boy Conrad, dig?

13:13.619 --> 13:15.162
Fully digging, completely dug.

13:15.246 --> 13:19.083
One more thing, you and Conrad, are you
like together-together, or just like what?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.419
We're business partners. Can I go in now?

13:21.502 --> 13:23.129
You ain't done nothing?

13:23.212 --> 13:26.715
Come on, two fine-looking people,
all hormones and shit,

13:26.799 --> 13:28.259
working side by side.

13:30.469 --> 13:32.763
OK, fine. We kissed once.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.976
But I don't know, we never really talked
about it, and now it's kind of weird,

13:37.059 --> 13:38.686
and this whole thing
happened with you guys,

13:38.769 --> 13:41.856
so it's not exactly a great time for us
to process our feelings.

13:41.939 --> 13:43.899
- So, no booty, huh?
- No, no booty.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.317
Ha!

13:46.152 --> 13:49.488
- What do you mean, "Ha"?
- As in I bet U-Turn and I win.

13:49.572 --> 13:52.366
I knew that pretty nigger
never got up in your business.

13:52.450 --> 13:54.535
- How do you know?
- You just told me.

13:54.618 --> 13:57.538
I know that. How did you know before?

13:57.621 --> 13:59.039
- I just knew.
- How?

13:59.123 --> 14:00.875
- I just did.
- How?

14:04.420 --> 14:06.422
I've gotta go. This discussion is not over.

14:06.505 --> 14:08.507
Yeah, it is,
cos I know these type of things.

14:08.591 --> 14:10.676
I'm like a deep dicking psychic.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.554
Leave the keys
so we can listen to the radio.

14:23.022 --> 14:26.150
Jesus Christ,
what do you want from me now?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.652
I can't believe you told Dana.
How could you tell Dana?

14:28.736 --> 14:31.155
You fuck up my marriage,
I fuck up yours. Even.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.658
- Even, my ass! I love Dana.
- Then what were you doing inside my wife?

14:34.742 --> 14:38.370
Your wife's enticing snatch has nothing to do
with my deep and abiding love for my wife.

14:38.454 --> 14:40.081
So give me your car keys.
I'm going after my woman.

14:40.164 --> 14:41.540
I drive a motorcycle.

14:41.624 --> 14:44.251
And I'm not giving you
a goddamn thing, you asshole.

14:44.335 --> 14:47.880
I was married to Celia for 17 fucking years,

14:47.963 --> 14:51.467
and you waltzed in
and fucked everything up. Literally.

14:52.885 --> 14:56.680
I only wish I'd fucked your wife
before I told her you cheated.

14:57.848 --> 14:59.517
Dana would never fuck you!

15:00.559 --> 15:04.230
- Oh, really, how do you know?
- Dana won't fuck anyone.

15:05.147 --> 15:08.234
Something about a short cervix
and how she might be a lesbian.

15:08.317 --> 15:09.693
You have four kids.

15:09.777 --> 15:11.862
Whose names could have been
Tequila Shots,

15:11.946 --> 15:15.783
Snuck It In While She Was Sleeping,
Doing It For A Lexus, and Turkey Baster.

15:15.866 --> 15:17.993
But she gets me, she thinks I'm funny.

15:18.077 --> 15:20.454
She buys my underwear,
she puts new blades in my razor.

15:20.538 --> 15:23.582
She makes these amazing lamb chops.
And you told!

15:23.666 --> 15:26.335
The only thing Dana hates
more than sex is public embarrassment.

15:26.419 --> 15:28.003
She is never gonna forgive me.

15:28.087 --> 15:29.630
- You home-wrecking fuck!
- Ah!

15:29.713 --> 15:32.133
God... damn it!

15:32.591 --> 15:34.218
My marriage is over.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.720
Yeah? Well, welcome to the club.

15:37.221 --> 15:39.473
- Oh, shit, I'm bleeding.
- Good.

15:41.892 --> 15:43.060
Jesus!

15:43.936 --> 15:45.604
H. Christ.

15:54.572 --> 15:56.323
<i># I drive an American car</i>

15:56.407 --> 15:59.910
<i># I drive an American car
Drive, I drive an American car</i>

15:59.994 --> 16:02.329
<i># Though it's hard to start an American car</i>

16:02.413 --> 16:06.333
<i># When it does it just stalls out
in the worst possible place</i>

16:06.417 --> 16:08.377
<i># And I paid 50 bucks for it</i>

16:08.461 --> 16:12.089
<i># And I feel like I was ripped off</i>

16:12.173 --> 16:14.467
<i># Oh, I hate this car, I hate this car</i>

16:14.550 --> 16:16.385
<i># It's big and ugly and rusted out</i>

16:16.469 --> 16:20.389
<i># It drinks a lot of gas and burns a lot of oil
and it smells of beer</i>

16:20.473 --> 16:24.643
<i># And I hope I get out of this parking lot alive #</i>

16:31.066 --> 16:33.986
You know,
I dropped you on your head once.

16:36.030 --> 16:38.157
You were about 15 months old.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.993
We were playing this game
where you'd climb up my legs

16:41.077 --> 16:44.872
and I'd flip you over and you'd land
back on your feet, but this one time,

16:44.955 --> 16:48.125
you kept climbing up my body
and you wouldn't flip.

16:48.209 --> 16:51.295
And I'm holding your hands,
and your little feet are scaling up my body

16:51.378 --> 16:54.840
and onto my shoulders,
and I'm saying, "Silas, stop. "

16:55.341 --> 16:57.134
But you were laughing.

16:57.218 --> 17:00.721
You were almost completely upside down.

17:00.805 --> 17:02.681
Your hard-soled shoe goes... wham,

17:02.765 --> 17:04.433
right into my eye, and...

17:05.601 --> 17:06.977
I let go.

17:07.603 --> 17:11.482
You went headfirst... into the hardwood.

17:11.565 --> 17:15.069
If Celia hadn't shown up,
we'd be in business right now.

17:15.152 --> 17:17.988
How did you even get into the safe?

17:18.071 --> 17:22.201
The combination was your maiden name.
You think that was tricky?

17:22.952 --> 17:27.123
Wow. You know what?
I can't do this right now.

17:30.793 --> 17:33.671
I need to get my hands on what you took

17:33.754 --> 17:37.633
and give it back to some people who will
do some very bad things if I don't.

17:37.716 --> 17:39.176
Am I being clear?

17:40.594 --> 17:42.763
- What bad things?
- Silas!

17:42.847 --> 17:45.766
Where is the... Where is the dry-cleaning?

17:46.183 --> 17:50.146
I need every last bag of clothing
or my boss is going to kill me -

17:50.229 --> 17:53.357
just shoot me dead. You got that?

17:56.026 --> 17:57.236
Dead!

17:58.529 --> 17:59.905
Where is it?

18:02.032 --> 18:03.993
It's all in the trunk of my car.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.495
- Your car?
- Yes.

18:07.204 --> 18:09.373
Would that be the car Celia's driving?

18:09.457 --> 18:11.125
- That would be it.
- Jesus Christ.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.002
The cop took my keys
and gave them to her.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.378
I couldn't do anything.

18:15.421 --> 18:18.257
Can't your husband help you out of this?

18:27.433 --> 18:28.559
Mom?

18:30.227 --> 18:31.353
Mom!

18:32.855 --> 18:34.106
I gotta go.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.861
- Are you taking me with you?
- What?

18:39.070 --> 18:42.364
No. At least if you're here,
I know where you are.

18:54.210 --> 18:57.171
- Hello, Andy?
- Hey, Nance, how's it going?

18:57.254 --> 18:59.632
Yeah, yeah, of course I got Shane.

18:59.715 --> 19:02.593
In fact, I think we're gonna stay out
for a while, is that cool?

19:02.676 --> 19:04.678
Yeah? Great!

19:04.762 --> 19:08.224
OK, don't worry about a thing,
and he's having a blast.

19:08.307 --> 19:11.393
Don't be such a mother hen.
OK, we'll see you later, OK, bye.

19:11.477 --> 19:15.356
I've seen her, she stole mint patties.
You gonna pay for those?

19:15.439 --> 19:19.485
The kid, was there a kid with her,
about yea high, beige suit?

19:19.568 --> 19:23.072
Sure, the kid was here. Had the grilled cheese
special and paid all in quarters.

19:23.155 --> 19:24.907
He left a decent tip, though.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.951
How long ago did the girl leave?

19:27.034 --> 19:29.787
Oh, about two hours.
She left with Bear.

19:29.870 --> 19:32.248
- What does that mean?
- Bear, he's a trucker.

19:32.331 --> 19:34.792
And the kid was with them,
with the girl and the Bear?

19:34.875 --> 19:37.753
They left, and then the kid drove a blue van

19:37.837 --> 19:40.339
around the parking lot for an hour
before taking off.

19:40.423 --> 19:42.925
A little young to be driving,
if you ask me, but,

19:43.008 --> 19:46.929
all the preservatives people eat nowadays,
everybody's looking younger, so...

19:47.012 --> 19:50.099
- who knows?
- Oh, man, come on, we gotta jam.

19:50.182 --> 19:52.435
What kind of rig does Bear drive?

19:52.518 --> 19:54.145
Blue, like a cerulean blue,

19:54.228 --> 19:57.022
but with sparkle in it.
Yosemite Sam mud flaps.

19:57.106 --> 20:00.025
I know it's a cliché,
but I think he's being ironic.

20:00.109 --> 20:03.863
Holy Ned, you're a giant redwood.
Move, Redwood!

20:03.946 --> 20:06.866
I'm not Redwood. I'm not Yetiman,

20:06.949 --> 20:08.868
Master Mohawk, Chief Wiggum,

20:08.951 --> 20:10.953
Eskimo Pie, Great White North,

20:11.036 --> 20:12.663
or Washington Redskin,

20:12.747 --> 20:16.250
and I'm not your snow nigger,
you rude piece of shit.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.627
I'm fucking through with you.

20:19.295 --> 20:20.337
He...

20:20.421 --> 20:22.506
Hey! Hey, hey!

20:22.590 --> 20:26.343
Come on, I called you snow nigga,
with an "a. "

20:26.427 --> 20:28.596
Jeez, Nanook, you're so sensitive.

20:33.684 --> 20:35.227
Oh!

20:37.980 --> 20:40.274
You don't even know
if the bitch's coming back.

20:40.357 --> 20:42.735
I got a hundred G's cash out the door.

20:43.778 --> 20:46.781
I'm offering you a great deal here, take it.

20:47.198 --> 20:48.491
That's not a great deal.

20:48.574 --> 20:50.576
Shut your mouth before I piss in it.

20:50.659 --> 20:52.161
That's just bad hygiene.

20:52.244 --> 20:54.663
- Where were you raised?
- Where were you raised?

20:54.747 --> 20:58.375
Unibrow, stinky armpit,
sweat-suit-wearing motherfucker.

20:58.459 --> 21:01.128
50 cent on the dollar. Final offer. Take it.

21:01.212 --> 21:02.296
Euch!

21:02.379 --> 21:03.547
What?

21:08.427 --> 21:10.763
- Is that a "yes"?
- No.

21:13.057 --> 21:14.975
Fine, fine, yes, I'll take it.

21:15.059 --> 21:17.603
- Wise choice.
- Shit.

21:19.772 --> 21:24.402
Celia, it's Nancy. I'd really like
to get Silas's car back. Please call me.

21:24.485 --> 21:29.323
- It stinks in here.
- How could you let him smoke in my car?

21:30.241 --> 21:32.576
No more smoking in this car.

21:32.827 --> 21:35.538
No more puff-puff with the tobacco stick.

21:36.664 --> 21:39.542
You're rude, you know that?
You're gonna get cancer.

21:40.501 --> 21:44.380
Hey, I thought these things were supposed
to get great gas mileage and shit.

21:44.463 --> 21:48.092
They do. Just haven't filled
the tank for two weeks.

21:48.175 --> 21:50.177
Two weeks is pretty good.

22:09.405 --> 22:11.157
Hey! Hey!

22:12.742 --> 22:14.285
Armenian guy.

22:14.952 --> 22:16.078
Hey!

22:16.829 --> 22:18.414
That was weird.

22:18.497 --> 22:21.584
Get away from the car!
Get the fuck away from the car!

22:23.627 --> 22:26.088
Marvin, what are we doing?

22:26.172 --> 22:28.424
I was thinking that the car
was gonna blow up.

22:28.507 --> 22:29.633
Oh.

22:30.551 --> 22:33.137
Those Armenians,
they like to blow shit up, you know?

22:33.220 --> 22:34.263
Really?

22:34.346 --> 22:38.309
Actually, I don't know. He the first one
I met, but he seemed real shifty.

22:45.983 --> 22:47.109
Hello?

22:47.193 --> 22:48.319
Oh.

22:48.652 --> 22:50.529
OK, and he never tapped it.

22:50.613 --> 22:52.740
You owe me a flat screen, motherfucker.

22:52.823 --> 22:54.408
Oh, yes, you do!

22:55.493 --> 22:56.702
OK.

22:57.536 --> 22:58.746
Bye.

22:59.497 --> 23:01.415
We can get back in the car now.

23:02.416 --> 23:03.959
Who was that?

23:04.668 --> 23:05.878
U- Turn.

23:06.337 --> 23:07.838
What'd he say?

23:08.798 --> 23:10.257
You were traded.

23:10.341 --> 23:11.509
I was what?

23:11.592 --> 23:13.677
He says he bought
your debt off the Armenians.

23:13.761 --> 23:15.638
Your ass and your grass is all his now.

23:15.721 --> 23:18.599
And he says if we don't come back
with the pot soon,

23:18.682 --> 23:22.061
I gotta shoot you in the head.
So, let's really focus on finding it, OK?

23:22.144 --> 23:24.271
You got a really nice head.

23:29.944 --> 23:31.153
Thanks.

23:33.531 --> 23:35.449
How much do I love the over-medicated?

23:35.533 --> 23:37.743
I can feel my pores tightening.

23:38.619 --> 23:41.664
Check this out. Tylenol... with codeine.

23:41.747 --> 23:44.708
Ooh, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

23:48.129 --> 23:49.672
Ohh!

23:50.172 --> 23:51.841
Hey, man, look.

23:51.924 --> 23:54.468
I'm so sorry I fucked your wife
with my giant cock.

23:54.552 --> 23:58.055
I am so not threatened by you.

23:58.139 --> 24:01.308
I happen to be hung like a beer can.
And I'm talking Guinness stout.

24:01.392 --> 24:04.562
Oh, please. You're like one of
those mini bottles of Crystal Geyser.

24:04.645 --> 24:07.940
Fuck you, I've seen you in the steam.
I got you by a good inch.

24:08.566 --> 24:10.276
You care to make it interesting?

24:10.359 --> 24:11.360
How much?

24:11.444 --> 24:14.071
Your share of the bouillon
when Nancy sells the crop.

24:14.155 --> 24:17.158
- That's a lot of cash.
- Yeah? I got a lot of dick.

24:17.241 --> 24:18.284
You're on, bitch.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.953
- Here, come here.
- All right, come on.

24:21.996 --> 24:23.330
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

24:23.414 --> 24:25.708
- See.
- Yeah, you know. You're all talk, buddy.

24:25.791 --> 24:27.293
- Oh, yeah?
- You're all talk.

24:28.419 --> 24:30.838
- Winner and still champion.
- Yeah, only in length.

24:30.921 --> 24:34.133
That's what counts, moron.
Circumference doesn't factor in a size war.

24:34.216 --> 24:37.553
Well, then flaccid doesn't count either.
I'm a grower, not a shower.

24:37.636 --> 24:38.637
Wanna measure hard?

24:38.721 --> 24:41.140
Yeah. You're not getting my share
without a fair fight.

24:41.223 --> 24:43.476
- Fine.
- All right.

24:44.018 --> 24:45.311
Come on.

24:49.982 --> 24:51.442
- Occupied!
- Occupied!

24:56.655 --> 24:58.824
- We took too many drugs.
- Yes, yes, we did.

25:00.951 --> 25:03.496
We're having a great time,
we're at the dump.

25:06.207 --> 25:07.208
Yeah. He...

25:09.251 --> 25:11.545
He wanted to see where the trash went.

25:17.593 --> 25:19.303
OK, bye.

25:20.262 --> 25:22.890
This is one nice fucking
neighbourhood.

25:22.973 --> 25:25.935
- How long you live here?
- Too long. Shh, it's ringing.

25:26.018 --> 25:27.645
Looks like it's from a movie.

25:27.728 --> 25:31.232
Like with the plants and trees,
no chain-link.

25:32.108 --> 25:33.609
These places got alarms?

25:33.692 --> 25:36.320
Celia, I'm outside your house.
Where's my son's car?

25:36.404 --> 25:40.116
<i>Why, it's in your driveway, Nancy.
I told him I'd drive it home,</i>

25:40.199 --> 25:42.827
<i>and I always try to be a woman of my word.</i>

25:42.910 --> 25:45.538
<i>Oh, you owe me $37.50 for gas.</i>

25:47.123 --> 25:48.374
<i>Hello?</i>

25:49.291 --> 25:50.960
<i>Hello, Nancy?</i>

25:54.964 --> 25:58.259
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

25:58.342 --> 26:00.136
This ain't good.

26:00.219 --> 26:06.100
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

26:16.986 --> 26:19.905
<i>Silas's phone, Celia speaking.</i>

26:19.989 --> 26:23.451
Hey, Nancy, I helped myself
to some of your vodka,

26:23.534 --> 26:25.077
I hope you don't mind.

26:26.829 --> 26:29.039
Oh, and I borrowed some garden shears.

26:29.123 --> 26:32.752
You know, they were really helpful,
so, thanks.

26:35.421 --> 26:39.175
I did this for your own good, Nancy.

26:46.932 --> 26:49.143
<i># You fucked up</i>

26:49.226 --> 26:50.394
<i># You bitch</i>

26:50.478 --> 26:53.731
<i># You really fucked up</i>

26:54.815 --> 26:58.027
<i>- # You fucked up...
- He gonna be mad.</i>

26:58.110 --> 27:00.529
<i>#... fucking Nazi whore</i>

27:02.948 --> 27:05.034
<i># You dicked me over</i>

27:05.117 --> 27:06.827
<i># But now you'll pay</i>

27:06.911 --> 27:09.330
<i># You fucked up...</i>

27:09.413 --> 27:11.040
<i># Aaahhh!</i>

27:26.430 --> 27:28.766
<i># Well, you dicked me over</i>

27:28.849 --> 27:30.559
<i># Now, you'll pay</i>

27:30.643 --> 27:32.895
<i># You fucked up</i>

27:32.978 --> 27:37.691
<i># Aaahhh!</i>

27:37.775 --> 27:39.485
<i># Well, you... #</i>
