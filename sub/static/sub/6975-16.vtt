00:39.653 --> 00:42.451
( panting )

00:42.489 --> 00:44.047
MAN: Stop right there!

00:44.124 --> 00:46.684
- Freeze.
-Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

00:46.760 --> 00:48.819
I need to tell the President something.

00:48.895 --> 00:51.728
I need to tell... I need to tell
the President something.

00:51.798 --> 00:53.129
GUARD: Get down on the ground.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.325
I need to see the President.
He needs to know.

00:56.370 --> 00:59.635
Look, he needs to know.

00:59.673 --> 01:03.871
Aliens-- Aliens-- they're taking over
the United States.

01:03.944 --> 01:08.404
- He needs to know.
- GUARD 1: He's got a weapon.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.143
Get the weapon! Get the weapon!

01:10.384 --> 01:12.579
He's shot. He shot himself.

01:12.652 --> 01:16.554
Damn it. Stupid son of a bitch.
What was he thinking?

01:16.590 --> 01:20.583
-MAN: Get a medic!
-MAN #2: Get a medic!

01:20.660 --> 01:23.857
Please, the President...

02:38.505 --> 02:40.439
( screaming )

02:50.083 --> 02:51.050
( screaming )

02:58.725 --> 03:01.125
Mulder, are you okay?

03:02.229 --> 03:04.663
Yeah.

03:04.731 --> 03:07.666
For a guy who was, uh...

03:07.734 --> 03:10.726
in a coffiin not too long ago I
think I'm doing pretty damn good.

03:12.839 --> 03:16.798
I don't quite have my legs
under me...yet.

03:19.546 --> 03:21.878
Well, you might want to
consider sitting down

03:21.915 --> 03:24.782
when you hear what we have to tell you.

03:25.952 --> 03:28.614
Uh-oh.

03:28.688 --> 03:31.054
Now, it's, uh...

03:31.124 --> 03:32.785
it's good news.

03:32.859 --> 03:35.589
It's... it's miraculous news.

03:35.662 --> 03:40.690
I can't possibly exaggerate the
inconceivability of you sitting here.

03:42.936 --> 03:44.164
Let's be honest...

03:44.237 --> 03:46.865
your condition may be more
incredible than your recovery.

03:49.075 --> 03:51.635
Whatever neurological disorder
you were suffering from

03:51.711 --> 03:53.804
it's no longer detectable.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.281
After a course of
transfusions and antivirals

03:57.517 --> 04:01.647
it has rid your body of the virus
that was invading it.

04:01.721 --> 04:04.656
The scars on your face

04:04.724 --> 04:06.248
on your hands, on your feet,
on your chest

04:06.326 --> 04:10.695
they, they seem to be
repairing themselves.

04:10.764 --> 04:13.892
Mulder, you are in perfect health.

04:16.236 --> 04:18.966
Wow.

04:19.039 --> 04:21.974
How do you feel Agent Mulder?

04:22.007 --> 04:25.171
Like Austin Powers.

04:25.245 --> 04:27.577
( chuckles )

04:44.264 --> 04:46.232
Must feel good to be home.

05:04.284 --> 05:07.276
Something looks different.

05:09.289 --> 05:12.224
- It's clean.
- ( chuckles )

05:12.292 --> 05:16.023
Ah... that's it.

05:22.168 --> 05:23.897
Missing Molly.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.200
Yeah.

05:28.308 --> 05:29.935
She wasn't as lucky as you.

05:36.249 --> 05:38.274
Mulder...

05:41.655 --> 05:46.683
I don't know if you'll ever
understand what it was like.

05:49.729 --> 05:52.698
First learning of your abduction...

05:52.732 --> 05:56.133
and then searching for you
and fiinding you dead.

05:58.638 --> 06:01.903
And now to have you back and, uh...

06:03.343 --> 06:05.208
Well, you act like you're surprised.

06:05.278 --> 06:06.836
( chuckles )

06:10.750 --> 06:12.445
I prayed a lot.

06:16.322 --> 06:19.120
And my prayers have been answered.

06:19.192 --> 06:23.026
In more ways than one.

06:23.096 --> 06:24.927
Yeah.

06:26.099 --> 06:29.865
I'm happy for you.

06:29.936 --> 06:31.995
I think I know...

06:32.072 --> 06:34.734
how much that means to you.

06:43.850 --> 06:46.944
- Mulder--
- I'm sorry.

06:46.986 --> 06:48.954
I don't mean to be cold or ungrateful.

06:48.988 --> 06:53.015
I just... I have no idea where I fiit in.

06:53.093 --> 06:55.118
Right now.

06:56.996 --> 06:59.829
I just, uh...

06:59.899 --> 07:05.303
I'm having a little trouble...
processing... everything.

07:17.851 --> 07:19.910
It's Marion the Librarian, boys.

07:22.722 --> 07:24.519
I got the new Harry Potter.

07:24.758 --> 07:26.726
( laughing )

07:38.304 --> 07:41.865
Our Lord and Savior. For you.

07:41.941 --> 07:44.034
I've got my books.

07:44.110 --> 07:47.136
Expand your horizons.

07:47.213 --> 07:51.377
I know all I need to know.

07:51.451 --> 07:53.385
Want to bet?

08:01.861 --> 08:04.853
Put a rise in your Levi's.

08:28.254 --> 08:29.923
REPORTER:
Again, our top story is
the death of a man

08:29.923 --> 08:30.548
REPORTER:
Again, our top story is
the death of a man

08:30.790 --> 08:35.489
who jumped the fence at the White House
last evening his name now released.

08:35.562 --> 08:39.861
Howard Salt, a federal employee
working on the U.S. Census

08:39.899 --> 08:43.835
got as far as the White House
front door yesterday where
he was stopped by security

08:43.903 --> 08:45.370
and shot accidentally by his own gun.

08:45.438 --> 08:47.429
According to a Secret Service spokesman

08:47.507 --> 08:50.533
Salt appeared to be
irrational and resisted arrest

08:50.610 --> 08:53.875
shouting unspecifiied grievances
against the U.S. Government

08:53.947 --> 08:56.541
and demanding to speak
with the President.

08:56.616 --> 08:59.881
Coworkers describe him
as likable and hardworking.

08:59.953 --> 09:02.080
We never see them coming.

09:03.623 --> 09:07.081
People are so rarely what they seem.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.151
Gentlemen

09:09.229 --> 09:11.060
please, sit down.

09:19.072 --> 09:23.634
An application was submitted
to me this morning by Agent Scully

09:23.877 --> 09:28.246
on behalf of our old friend,
Fox Mulder, for reinstatement.

09:28.281 --> 09:31.011
I assume you both know about this.

09:31.084 --> 09:34.178
- Reinstatement?
- To the X-Files.

09:34.254 --> 09:35.983
I thought Mulder just went home.

09:36.055 --> 09:39.183
Well, somebody's very anxious
for him to get back to work.

09:39.259 --> 09:42.854
I wanted you both to see this
before I deny the application.

09:42.929 --> 09:44.453
What is it?

09:44.530 --> 09:47.863
It's a review of the success
rate of your X-Files

09:47.934 --> 09:50.232
since Agent Doggett joined the team.

09:50.303 --> 09:53.272
-Damn impressive,John.
- Impressive, sir?

09:55.875 --> 09:57.968
The only thing impressive
about my work on the X-Files

09:58.044 --> 10:00.410
is that I even know what's
going on half the time.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.108
From this report, you and Agent Scully
have had more arrests on percentage

10:03.182 --> 10:05.673
than she and Mulder over seven years.

10:05.919 --> 10:09.252
- Take a look.
- That's not very fair to Agent Mulder.

10:09.322 --> 10:11.256
So many of his cases involve...

10:11.324 --> 10:13.622
Aliens?

10:13.693 --> 10:17.185
There lies the problem.

10:17.230 --> 10:22.031
The F.B.I. isn't a place
for personal crusades.

10:22.068 --> 10:27.700
I'm asking you both
to make that understood

10:27.941 --> 10:29.704
on my behalf.

10:29.943 --> 10:32.912
Well, you can't ask me to tell
Mulder he's off the X-Files.

10:32.946 --> 10:34.311
It's his unit. He created it.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.541
I'm not asking you,John.

10:43.656 --> 10:48.252
You sent me to fiind Mulder. I found him.

10:48.328 --> 10:50.489
Don't charge me with driving
a stake through his heart.

10:50.563 --> 10:54.499
Maybe you'd rather I close the X-Files.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.058
Then we'd both be getting what we want.

11:01.207 --> 11:03.038
Let's go, Agent Doggett.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.648
Now.

11:13.553 --> 11:15.487
Kersh wants to put me behind a desk?

11:15.555 --> 11:18.490
That is not what Kersh wants.

11:18.558 --> 11:22.187
No, I think Kersh wants
you to quit, Mulder.

11:22.261 --> 11:26.027
It's more than that.
He wants to punish you, to hurt you.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.192
And you by putting you in this position.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.997
And Agent Scully,
for not giving up on me.

11:31.037 --> 11:34.768
Truth is, this is a bullet that
was fiired about eight years ago.

11:35.008 --> 11:36.999
It's a magic bullet that's been
going round and round

11:37.076 --> 11:40.375
and right now it seems poised to
hit me right in the back of the head.

11:40.413 --> 11:43.143
I think the question is, are we going to
sit here and let this happen?

11:43.216 --> 11:46.583
Scully, you're going to give
birth in a couple months.

11:46.652 --> 11:49.712
You can talk as tough as you like
but you know and I know and they know

11:49.789 --> 11:52.553
that in a little while you're going
to have more important things

11:52.592 --> 11:54.651
than whether or not
the X-Files remains open.

11:54.727 --> 11:58.458
They're not closing the X-Files.
Kersh aims to keep them open
withAgent Doggett running them.

11:58.531 --> 12:00.158
Agent who?

12:00.233 --> 12:05.034
I've had a partner for
the last several months.

12:05.104 --> 12:08.232
He was assigned to help me fiind you.

12:08.274 --> 12:11.573
Mission accomplished.

12:11.611 --> 12:15.172
Does he know what he's
doing at all, this guy?

12:15.248 --> 12:17.216
About the paranormal? Not much.

12:17.283 --> 12:21.413
I see. Then maybe the question is not
who fiired this magic bullet

12:21.487 --> 12:24.456
but whether or not it was a lone gunman.

12:24.524 --> 12:27.254
Agent Doggett is above reproach, Mulder.

12:27.326 --> 12:29.624
He's being maneuvered just like you.

12:29.662 --> 12:33.189
Well, good. At least he's maneuverable.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.327
Where are you going?

12:37.403 --> 12:41.362
Going to get dressed. For the fiirst time
I feel like getting back to work.

13:36.762 --> 13:40.323
- ( horn honking )
- Wrap it up and fall in.

13:47.673 --> 13:49.800
GUARD: Stay in line.

13:51.377 --> 13:53.345
Let's go.

13:55.181 --> 13:57.172
- Get back in line--
- Hey,you! ( yelling )

13:57.216 --> 14:00.413
( cheering )

14:00.486 --> 14:02.477
Go get that son of a bitch.

14:04.524 --> 14:05.752
Nobody move!

14:14.167 --> 14:15.862
Stand down!

14:24.410 --> 14:25.877
( train horn blowing )

15:32.878 --> 15:34.243
( gun cocks )

15:46.726 --> 15:48.921
Get over here. Over here now.

15:48.995 --> 15:51.930
Come on, sit down.
Hands behind your back.

15:51.998 --> 15:55.559
Head down. Down between your legs.

15:58.271 --> 16:00.967
Absalom. That's your name, right?
What are you looking at?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.974
The back of your neck.

16:04.310 --> 16:08.713
Sit up, Agent Doggett.
I had to make sure.

16:11.784 --> 16:15.515
- Make sure of what?
- Make sure that you're still you.

16:15.588 --> 16:21.424
Yeah, I'm still me. So why don't
you put that weapon down?

16:21.460 --> 16:25.260
You see this? Huh, do you see it?

16:25.331 --> 16:27.731
""Man shot at the White House.''

16:27.800 --> 16:32.430
They killed him for what he knew.

16:32.471 --> 16:36.498
- Then they'll kill me, too.
- Not if you put the weapon down.

16:36.575 --> 16:39.703
No. They'll kill me anyway.

16:41.347 --> 16:43.975
I got one chance here. With you.

16:45.084 --> 16:46.449
Sit down.

16:46.519 --> 16:48.714
Didn't I tell you to sit down?

16:54.026 --> 16:57.018
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're going with me.

16:57.096 --> 16:59.621
And I'm going to show you

16:59.699 --> 17:05.398
and you are going to spread the word.

17:05.471 --> 17:08.098
Doubting Thomas
is going to spread the word.

17:08.340 --> 17:11.310
What word?

17:11.377 --> 17:14.868
The invasion has begun.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.711
What invasion?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.913
- They're already here.
- Who's already here?

17:20.986 --> 17:23.386
Certain men have gone out among you

17:23.422 --> 17:25.982
and have withdrawn
the inhabitants of their city

17:26.058 --> 17:28.925
saying, ""Let us go, and serve other gods

17:28.961 --> 17:31.361
that ye have not known.''

17:31.430 --> 17:34.092
I don't know what that means.

17:34.133 --> 17:38.934
I open my mouth... in parables.

17:39.004 --> 17:41.768
I utter things that...

17:41.841 --> 17:45.402
have been kept secret from the world.

17:45.478 --> 17:47.105
( telephone ringing )

17:50.516 --> 17:55.852
On your knees,John Doggett.

17:55.921 --> 17:58.947
SKINNER:
He goes by the name Absalom.
Aself-styled prophet

17:58.991 --> 18:00.982
Agent Scully and I
apprehended in Montana

18:01.060 --> 18:03.585
where he commanded members
of a small UFO cult.

18:03.662 --> 18:05.129
( line ringing )

18:06.866 --> 18:08.925
These words were found
on the wall of his cell

18:09.001 --> 18:13.836
after he escaped from a work detail
40 miles from the state prison.

18:13.873 --> 18:15.670
Now, we don't know they mean

18:15.708 --> 18:19.838
butAbsalom claimed to have
knowledge of an alien invasion.

18:19.879 --> 18:26.478
There were also claims of
healings of numerous abductees

18:26.552 --> 18:29.385
that had been subjected
to alien torture.

18:29.455 --> 18:31.582
( snickering )

18:31.657 --> 18:35.559
Claims that have never
been substantiated... or refuted.

18:39.465 --> 18:41.695
But evidence of torture was real.

18:46.172 --> 18:49.073
Now, the only way we're going to
get answers is to bring this guy in.

18:49.108 --> 18:52.100
Just know the man that you're
looking for is dangerous.

18:52.178 --> 18:55.443
He's a felon, and he is
capable of physical violence.

18:55.514 --> 18:58.074
All right, that's it.

19:00.619 --> 19:03.053
- Where the hell is Agent Doggett?
- I can't reach him.

19:03.122 --> 19:05.613
I can't run this thing, Agent Scully.

19:05.658 --> 19:07.148
This is obviously an X-Files case.

19:07.226 --> 19:09.956
I know. And I'm all over it.
I will fiind him.

19:10.029 --> 19:11.997
( telephone ringing )

19:14.500 --> 19:17.526
I don't know if this is going
to make you feel any better.

19:23.909 --> 19:24.967
Hey.

19:27.079 --> 19:32.176
- Mulder...
- Who says you can't go home again?

19:32.251 --> 19:35.084
- What are you doing here?
- What's it look like?

19:35.154 --> 19:38.021
It looks like you want to give
them real ammunition to use on you

19:38.057 --> 19:42.551
- that's what it looks like.
- Hey, I am just down here
visiting my buds.

19:42.595 --> 19:45.723
Where is this Agent Doggett anyway?
What kind of hours does he keep?

19:45.798 --> 19:49.564
- Please, you do not want
to stir that up right now.
- Why?

19:49.635 --> 19:52.195
Because we have a manhunt in progress
and I wantAgent Doggett running it.

19:52.271 --> 19:55.138
Anything to do with this?

19:55.207 --> 19:57.767
This Absalom abductee class picture?

19:57.843 --> 20:00.812
Yes... it does.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.542
- Why?
- Because I noticed that
the man who was shot

20:03.616 --> 20:06.847
on The White House lawn is one of
the men in that photograph.

20:06.919 --> 20:09.547
Top right hand corner. In profiile.

20:09.622 --> 20:11.647
Howard Salt, if I'm not mistaken.

20:11.724 --> 20:14.557
He's right. You're right.

20:14.627 --> 20:17.960
Consider that a freebie.
The next one's going to cost you.

20:17.997 --> 20:20.522
- Why? What else do you know?
- Oh, I don't know anything.

20:20.599 --> 20:23.090
But you know me, I got a real big hunch.

20:23.135 --> 20:25.695
This Howard Salt was
a multiple alien abductee

20:25.771 --> 20:27.796
worked for the U.S. Census Bureau.

20:27.873 --> 20:30.000
Wanted to get word to the President
unspecifiied grievances.

20:30.075 --> 20:32.009
What do you want to bet
those grievances were?

20:32.044 --> 20:36.003
- You think he knew something?
- I think they killed him for it.

20:36.081 --> 20:39.016
The man jumped the White House fence.
He had a gun.

20:39.084 --> 20:42.019
Once again, I'm a betting man.
I'm betting he had more than that.

20:42.054 --> 20:44.579
Mulder, you make it sound like
this was a conspiracy.

20:44.657 --> 20:47.023
Ooh. There's that word again.

20:47.092 --> 20:50.027
You're being paranoid, Mulder.
Even for you.

20:50.095 --> 20:52.029
Do you want to hear something
really paranoid?

20:52.064 --> 20:54.157
The F.B.I. gets its way,
there's going to be nobody down here

20:54.233 --> 20:56.030
to ask the paranoid questions.

20:56.101 --> 20:58.661
Nobody to fiind those faces
in those photographs.

21:00.706 --> 21:04.198
Surely not this Agent Doggett.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.548
Just what do you have in mind

21:09.615 --> 21:11.913
if you don't mind my asking?

21:11.984 --> 21:16.011
It's my head that's going to
get blown off if there's a screw up.

21:16.088 --> 21:19.683
We're going to get what that man
at the White House died for.

21:19.758 --> 21:21.885
- ( cocks )
- To get it?

21:21.961 --> 21:26.193
- To get it where?
- You just concentrate on not
screwing up, Agent Doggett.

21:26.265 --> 21:27.732
( gun chamber clicks )

21:29.234 --> 21:34.907
Either way, you and I are going
to become overnight sensations.

21:34.907 --> 21:36.898
Either way, you and I are going
to become overnight sensations.

21:41.947 --> 21:44.279
Mulder, I know you know this
but if anything leaves this room

21:44.350 --> 21:47.581
-you could be in violation of the law.
- Really?

21:47.620 --> 21:51.784
When I was dead I was hoping
maybe they changed the rules.

21:51.857 --> 21:55.588
Mulder, just being here could be used
by Kersh as cause for dismissal.

21:55.661 --> 21:58.357
Then why don't you shut the door
so he doesn't fiind out.

22:09.074 --> 22:12.009
I just don't know what you're hoping
to fiind in Salt's personal effects.

22:12.044 --> 22:14.103
Neither do I, really.

22:14.179 --> 22:16.306
But maybe it's like
Howard Salt's picture

22:16.348 --> 22:19.146
I'll know it when I see it.

22:19.218 --> 22:20.685
So you'll risk the consequences

22:20.719 --> 22:22.152
even though there may be nothing here?

22:22.221 --> 22:23.620
You don't get it, do you, Scully?

22:23.689 --> 22:25.714
The man shot at the White
House, the prison escapee

22:25.791 --> 22:27.691
there's something bubbling
to the surface here.

22:27.726 --> 22:29.216
I want to know what it is.

22:29.294 --> 22:31.319
Mulder, you've been through an ordeal

22:31.397 --> 22:33.194
that defiies all logical explanation.

22:33.265 --> 22:37.929
How can you think that
these two men have the answers

22:38.003 --> 22:40.665
when they defy all
standard of credibility?

22:40.739 --> 22:44.732
Since when has an X-File not defiied
a certain standard of credibility?

22:44.810 --> 22:46.641
At least that's the way it used to work.

22:46.712 --> 22:50.045
Look, Scully, I need to make sense
of what happened to me.

22:50.082 --> 22:51.947
So that I can stop it.

22:52.017 --> 22:54.212
Because if I can't stop it,
it could happen to anyone.

22:54.253 --> 22:57.654
It could happen to you. And who's to say
it's going to stop there?

22:57.723 --> 23:01.819
Mulder, if you go down the X-Files
will go down, too.

23:01.894 --> 23:05.762
Theoretically, they could put
you in prison for what you're doing here.

23:05.831 --> 23:07.890
Yeah, well, compared to where I just was

23:07.966 --> 23:09.399
prison would be a Princess Cruise.

23:16.975 --> 23:20.968
Ho. Hey. What the hell is this?

23:21.046 --> 23:25.039
The entire hard drive is taken up
with this. Ten gigabytes of memory.

23:35.928 --> 23:38.419
- It's been encrypted.
- Mm.

23:38.497 --> 23:40.965
What are you doing?

23:41.033 --> 23:43.695
I'm going to book myself
on that Princess Cruise.

23:47.806 --> 23:48.966
I'll book it for you.

24:17.536 --> 24:20.937
State your name and your business.

24:20.973 --> 24:24.932
Special Agent John Doggett, F.B.I.

24:45.130 --> 24:46.119
( buzzer )

25:02.047 --> 25:04.174
( beeping )

25:10.122 --> 25:15.116
I hope you know I got no idea
where I'm going down here.

25:15.194 --> 25:18.960
I just need access to wherever
they compile all the available data

25:19.031 --> 25:21.226
- from the current U.S. Census.
- And then what?

25:21.300 --> 25:25.134
Then you pick up the phone you tell
the F.B.I. why you aren't coming to work

25:25.204 --> 25:27.798
until somebody pays us
some serious attention.

25:27.873 --> 25:30.808
Just so you're not surprised
we might not make it that far.

25:30.876 --> 25:34.175
We passed through an X-ray scanner
on the way in here back at the gate.

25:34.246 --> 25:36.237
Well, you better hope we make it.

25:36.315 --> 25:38.340
I'd hate to see you die in vain.

25:38.417 --> 25:41.079
That's sort of in your hands, huh?
So just in case

25:41.119 --> 25:45.215
how about you tell me what's in this
facility that's worth me dying for.

25:45.290 --> 25:47.451
- It's all in the Census data. Proof.
- What?

25:47.526 --> 25:52.156
That they're already here.
That they're already among us.

25:52.231 --> 25:54.165
It's all in there.

25:54.233 --> 25:58.966
I got a loaded gun pointed at
this man's head! He's an F.B.I. agent!

25:59.037 --> 26:01.164
- Listen to him!Just back off!.
- I'll pull the trigger!

26:01.240 --> 26:03.299
- Listen to the man! Back off!.
- I'll pull it.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.400
Lower your weapons! Listen to him!

26:22.327 --> 26:24.295
SKINNER:
It may not be the best way

26:24.363 --> 26:26.058
but it's certainly one way
to catch an escaped convict.

26:26.131 --> 26:27.621
I'll give you that, Agent Doggett.

26:27.866 --> 26:30.494
I'd just as soon stick
to the old-fashioned way, sir.

26:30.535 --> 26:32.298
Shot was a little too close for comfort.

26:32.371 --> 26:34.931
You say this man claimed
the U.S. Census Bureau had data

26:35.007 --> 26:37.134
information that
he was after that connects

26:37.209 --> 26:39.143
to this man who was shot
on the White House lawn?

26:39.211 --> 26:42.305
Proof, he said,
that they were here among us

26:42.381 --> 26:43.473
whoever they are.

26:43.548 --> 26:46.142
- ( door opens )
- Sir.

26:46.218 --> 26:48.516
- Agent Mulder.
- Is this John Doggett?

26:48.553 --> 26:51.181
You Agent Doggett?

26:51.256 --> 26:54.419
I hope you're not commending him
as a hero for what he did,
because he is not.

26:54.493 --> 26:57.155
I'm not about to referee a boxing match.

26:57.229 --> 27:00.460
-Just what's the problem here?
- The problem? You occupy
an offiice that used to be...

27:00.532 --> 27:04.468
devoted to fiinding the truth
and now you're busy burying
it, that's the problem.

27:04.536 --> 27:08.063
Whoa, you must've got your wires
crossed somewhere, Agent Mulder.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.200
- You got that man killed.
- I got him killed?

27:11.276 --> 27:13.608
Because of what he knew.
What he was going to expose.

27:13.645 --> 27:17.206
- You see this, Agent Mulder?
- I see you sitting there,
Agent Doggett.

27:19.051 --> 27:21.713
That's good enough for me.

27:33.665 --> 27:36.998
You've got to understand
what he's been through.

27:37.069 --> 27:39.128
I mean, now he's back and you're...

27:45.344 --> 27:48.643
You know, it's really not fair.
You've been dead for six months

27:48.680 --> 27:51.513
and you still look better than me.

27:51.550 --> 27:55.611
- But not by much.
- ( chuckling )

27:55.687 --> 27:59.748
Melvin. I'd be a whole lot
happier to see you

27:59.992 --> 28:02.722
if you'd just take
your hands off my ass.

28:02.961 --> 28:04.519
Sorry.

28:04.596 --> 28:06.996
I think it goes without saying

28:07.065 --> 28:10.228
that we're all, uh,
tremendously relieved.

28:10.302 --> 28:13.237
And not just because we got
big questions about your involvement

28:13.305 --> 28:14.567
in a certain blessed event.

28:17.409 --> 28:19.673
So much for playing a hunch, Mulder.

28:19.745 --> 28:23.772
The, uh, Gunmen were able
to decrypt the data that you found

28:24.016 --> 28:25.574
on Howard Salt's hard drive.

28:25.617 --> 28:27.380
It was a series of fiile directories

28:27.452 --> 28:29.477
that were downloaded
the day that he died.

28:29.554 --> 28:33.490
- Downloaded from where?
- The F.S.C., the Federal
Statistics Center.

28:33.558 --> 28:37.619
A government information bank
used by the U.S. Census Bureau
where your Mr. H. Salt worked.

28:37.696 --> 28:40.062
All right, what are you waiting for,
boys? Get cracking.

28:40.132 --> 28:41.793
Unless you think we're all idiots

28:42.034 --> 28:43.763
it's only Langly who's the idiot.

28:43.802 --> 28:45.599
LANGL Y:
Don't make like it's my hacking skills.

28:45.670 --> 28:47.763
I've never seen such
a radical counterdefensive.

28:48.006 --> 28:50.440
Fifteen minutes after
Howard Salt was shot

28:50.509 --> 28:52.636
at the White House, fiirewalls went up

28:52.711 --> 28:55.271
on every data bank
at that very facility.

28:55.347 --> 28:57.338
Well, why do that?

29:00.118 --> 29:04.054
Because I'm right. Because they would
kill to protect what's in those fiiles.

29:04.122 --> 29:07.558
Unless you got a password
we don't see any way short of that

29:07.626 --> 29:09.389
of getting ahold of this data.

29:09.461 --> 29:12.362
And the thing is
even if you have a pass code

29:12.397 --> 29:15.423
you still have to break
into the F.S.C.just to use it.

29:17.269 --> 29:19.669
We all agree, you're going
to have to let this one go.

29:19.738 --> 29:23.265
Oh. I see.

29:26.411 --> 29:30.677
Somebody's been doing a little
campaigning for her cause.

29:30.749 --> 29:33.343
Well, just remember, boys,
this is America.

29:33.418 --> 29:36.546
Just because you get more votes
doesn't mean you win.

29:57.476 --> 29:59.637
( sniffles, sighs )

29:59.711 --> 30:03.408
Your name came up today,John.
Folks are all worked up.

30:03.482 --> 30:05.211
They say you dodged a bullet.

30:05.283 --> 30:08.150
You can't dodge what you don't
see coming, Knowle, that's for sure.

30:08.220 --> 30:10.745
That should tell you something about
who you're dealing with.

30:10.822 --> 30:15.555
Who am I dealing with?
NSA? Secret Service? Military? Who?

30:15.627 --> 30:17.151
You know better than that,John.

30:17.195 --> 30:20.323
They shot the man in cold blood.

30:20.398 --> 30:23.128
Didn't even stop to ask him his name.

30:23.201 --> 30:25.226
The way I hear it he made it too easy.

30:25.303 --> 30:27.533
Taking a federal agent hostage
in a government facility.

30:27.606 --> 30:29.631
They'd have shot him anyway.

30:29.708 --> 30:32.677
- Without a doubt.
- Why?

30:32.744 --> 30:36.271
You and I have been friends
a long time,John.

30:36.348 --> 30:40.216
I tell you things.
But this is a whole other level.

30:40.285 --> 30:43.345
Don't give me that doublespeak crap,
Knowle. I'm being accused.

30:43.421 --> 30:47.357
- Accused? Of what?
- Of being used to get that man killed.

30:47.425 --> 30:50.724
- Well, that's insane.
- Oh, is it?

30:52.631 --> 30:56.431
Maybe I am being used,
and I just don't know it.

30:56.501 --> 30:58.366
That's what I want to know from you.

30:58.436 --> 31:00.301
Can't tell you that,John.

31:00.372 --> 31:03.205
But I can tell you something.

31:10.415 --> 31:12.610
One thing you already know.

31:12.684 --> 31:14.777
These men are very good shots.

31:14.853 --> 31:16.821
What don't I know?

31:16.855 --> 31:19.847
Three words.

31:25.497 --> 31:26.589
( horn honks )

31:30.569 --> 31:31.763
Hold up!

31:31.836 --> 31:33.565
Agent Doggett?

31:33.638 --> 31:36.630
- Yeah.
- Could you wait a minute?

31:36.708 --> 31:39.836
Agent Scully, I'm sorry
to surprise you. I don't mean to.

31:39.911 --> 31:42.402
What are you doing here at this hour?
You're freezing cold.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.244
I got something for Agent Mulder
only I can't go up there.

31:45.317 --> 31:47.182
I don't know him, and I
know he doesn't trust me

31:47.219 --> 31:48.686
so I'm going to ask
you to get it to him.

31:48.753 --> 31:50.983
What do you have to give him?

31:51.223 --> 31:55.216
Information about this
escaped convict who took me hostage.

31:55.293 --> 31:57.989
One of his disciples was the man
shot on the White House lawn.

31:58.230 --> 32:01.199
Oh, yeah, Agent Mulder
knows that already.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.224
What he doesn't know is that man
had a computer diskette

32:03.301 --> 32:05.667
that he was trying to get
to the President.

32:05.737 --> 32:08.001
- Who gave you this information?
- I can't tell you that

32:08.240 --> 32:12.404
but what I can tell you is is this
diskette was labeled with a pass code.

32:12.477 --> 32:15.446
You have this, this password?

32:15.513 --> 32:16.844
It's three words:

32:18.950 --> 32:21.680
""Fight the future.''

32:35.700 --> 32:37.793
Scully, what are you doing back?

32:40.372 --> 32:41.498
Did something just happen?

32:41.573 --> 32:43.632
I'm, um...

32:45.343 --> 32:50.713
I'm not exactly sure
I should tell you, Mulder.

32:50.782 --> 32:55.810
Scully, if you know something
that can get us moving forward
again, you need to tell me.

33:05.497 --> 33:07.260
( pounding on door )

33:12.570 --> 33:16.631
- Yeah, who is it?
-It's Skinner. Open up, Agent Doggett.

33:16.708 --> 33:19.074
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call from Agent Scully.

33:19.311 --> 33:23.008
- She's at her apartment,
completely beside herself.
- Over what?

33:23.081 --> 33:25.049
Mulder somehow got hold of
a computer password

33:25.083 --> 33:28.416
- to a database fiilled with secrets.
- What kind of secrets?

33:28.486 --> 33:31.717
Names of people the federal government
is tracking using the U.S. Census.

33:31.756 --> 33:33.621
Names of people who have
a certain genetic profiile.

33:33.692 --> 33:37.890
The same information he believes the
shooter at the White House knew about.

33:37.929 --> 33:41.831
- Also the guy that took you hostage.
- You said Scully was upset.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.063
That Mulder was going to act
on this information in some way that...

33:45.103 --> 33:47.503
What?

33:47.572 --> 33:51.804
- You know about this?
- I gave Scully the password.

33:51.876 --> 33:55.607
- Where did you get it?
- I can't tell you that.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.444
You know, I'm starting
to wonder about you, too,John.

33:58.516 --> 34:01.485
Just whose side you are working on here.

34:01.553 --> 34:05.353
I'm starting to wonder
about that myself.

34:11.329 --> 34:13.695
You said Scully's at her apartment.
What's the number there?

34:13.764 --> 34:17.132
That's why I'm here. I can't
get ahold of them-- either one of them--

34:17.335 --> 34:19.768
and I have no idea where they went.

34:22.139 --> 34:24.699
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you that, either.

34:24.743 --> 34:26.710
If I open up my mouth,
I put you at risk.

34:28.012 --> 34:31.038
You're going to have
to trust me on this.

34:43.460 --> 34:46.429
( sighs ) Oh, man.

34:46.498 --> 34:47.795
( knocking )

34:50.802 --> 34:53.737
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Agent Mulder?

34:53.772 --> 34:55.637
He wouldn't listen to me.

34:55.706 --> 34:57.572
Get out of here. Get going.

34:57.609 --> 35:00.976
- I can't do that to him.
- Then do it for yourself.

35:01.045 --> 35:04.412
Look, I think I may have set you up.

35:04.482 --> 35:06.006
- What?
- You just get out of here now

35:06.084 --> 35:07.915
- and I'll explain it to you later.
- No.

35:07.952 --> 35:11.149
You explain it to me now.
Set us up how, and with whom?

35:11.389 --> 35:15.553
The same men that shoot fiirst
and ask questions later.

35:16.694 --> 35:18.628
Agent Doggett!

35:21.866 --> 35:23.800
Frohike?

35:23.835 --> 35:27.134
Langly? Byers? Let's go.
I'm dying out here.

35:27.172 --> 35:31.506
Well, let us just fiinish
our cappuccino and biscotti,
and we'll see what we can do.

35:31.576 --> 35:33.601
BYERS:
You can start walking now, Mulder.

35:33.678 --> 35:36.613
- Is the system bypassed?
- You'll know if it's not.

35:36.681 --> 35:37.705
Great.

36:05.844 --> 36:11.077
FROHIKE: Smile, buddy boy.
The eye in the sky is watching.

36:11.115 --> 36:14.676
We're gonna be watching Mulder
get busted if I don't fiind
the override circuit.

36:14.752 --> 36:18.688
BYERS: Everything's under control,
Mulder.Just hold tight.

36:20.492 --> 36:22.153
LANGLY: Okay, got it!

36:22.227 --> 36:24.661
( beeps )

36:24.729 --> 36:26.219
And voila!

36:53.291 --> 36:55.725
Come on, guys. I'm on autopilot here.

36:55.793 --> 36:58.853
BYERS: Go left, Mulder.
There should be a pair of glass doors

36:58.930 --> 37:00.727
about a hundred yards up.

37:00.798 --> 37:04.199
According to our information,
those doors will lead you
straight into the data bank.

37:14.979 --> 37:16.913
Hey, who's working on the locks, fellas?

37:16.948 --> 37:19.940
Stand by. There you go.

37:26.791 --> 37:29.885
LANGL Y:  There ought to be two work
stations in the middle of the room.

37:29.961 --> 37:33.294
Either one will give you
access to the data.

37:45.777 --> 37:47.938
Let's do some E-mailing.

37:52.884 --> 37:55.682
Agent Mulder, get out of there!

37:59.157 --> 38:00.852
( pounding )

38:00.925 --> 38:03.792
- Agent Mulder!
- ( knocking )

38:03.828 --> 38:05.853
Mulder? What the hell's that?

38:05.930 --> 38:08.057
Your life's in danger
if you don't get out now.

38:08.132 --> 38:10.066
Just a fly buzzing around the window.

38:13.905 --> 38:16.305
( groaning )

38:18.676 --> 38:21.668
Agent Mulder, get out.
You're coming with me.

38:21.713 --> 38:23.704
I'm here to save you,
whatever you may think.

38:23.781 --> 38:26.909
I think you're trying to keep
this information from ever
seeing the light of day,

38:26.985 --> 38:29.977
just like you did once before,
Agent Doggett, that's what I think.

38:30.054 --> 38:32.682
Agent Mulder, I don't even know
what that information is.

38:32.757 --> 38:35.021
You're about to, along
with a lot of other people.

38:35.093 --> 38:37.220
There going to learn that
they've been targeted because
of their genetic profiiles

38:37.261 --> 38:41.254
for abduction and replacement
by alien facsimiles.

38:41.332 --> 38:45.735
What do you say we start off with
The Washington Post, huh?

38:45.803 --> 38:49.170
You can believe whatever you
want, but that information
is never going to make it out.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.868
What are you going to do, shoot me?

39:05.390 --> 39:08.985
( phone ringing )

39:09.060 --> 39:10.288
ALL: Hello.

39:10.328 --> 39:13.320
- Something's wrong.
- What are you talking about?

39:13.364 --> 39:16.629
I think we've been set up.
You have to get Mulder out of there.

39:16.701 --> 39:19.169
Right now that's basically impossible.

39:20.905 --> 39:22.964
Uh-oh. Mulder?

39:23.007 --> 39:25.339
- You'd better start typing fast.
- Why?

39:25.410 --> 39:26.934
The cavalry just arrived.

39:28.446 --> 39:30.846
You son of a bitch. You set me up.

39:30.915 --> 39:32.007
No.

39:34.886 --> 39:38.378
- Get him out of there, Gunmen.
- LANGLY: We're working on it.

39:38.456 --> 39:42.119
- Come on, Agent Mulder.
- Hey, get off of me.

39:43.895 --> 39:47.126
If I set you up, I wouldn't be here
trying to convince you to go.

39:47.198 --> 39:50.656
They're coming to kill you.
They're going to kill me, too.
That's the set up.

39:50.735 --> 39:53.295
LANGL Y: Mulder, I think
you better listen to the man.

39:53.371 --> 39:56.704
They got the data trapped
and I can't get it uploaded
let alone start transmission.

40:01.679 --> 40:03.943
- What is happening, Byers?
- I'm trying to fiigure that out.

40:04.015 --> 40:07.075
- Mulder, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

40:07.118 --> 40:10.246
It's look like there's really, uh,
no good way out of there.

40:10.321 --> 40:12.289
Uh...

40:12.323 --> 40:14.814
Except...

40:14.892 --> 40:16.018
Except what?

40:18.830 --> 40:24.393
It's a long shot, but, uh, worth a try
especially given the alternative.

40:26.170 --> 40:27.831
Here's what you do.

41:19.757 --> 41:21.884
You've got two minutes, Knowle.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.950
Two minutes to give me one good reason

41:24.028 --> 41:25.928
why I shouldn't put your name in lights.

41:25.997 --> 41:30.798
Why I shouldn't expose you
for the lying bastard you are.

41:30.868 --> 41:33.234
Hey,John, nice knowing you.

41:34.872 --> 41:36.840
You see that man across the park?

41:39.310 --> 41:41.335
You walk, that man puts your
name on all the wrong desks.

41:41.412 --> 41:43.437
I get it,John.

41:43.514 --> 41:48.008
You asked me for information,
I tell you what I can.

41:48.085 --> 41:50.451
What you do with it is out of my hands.

41:50.521 --> 41:53.388
You knew what I would do with it.
That's why you gave it to me.

41:53.457 --> 41:55.891
You expose me and then what?

41:55.960 --> 41:59.020
Where are you going to get your answers?

41:59.096 --> 42:02.429
'Cause you're standing
on the tip of the iceberg, my friend.

42:02.466 --> 42:06.197
- You're full of crap.
- Am I?

42:06.270 --> 42:09.797
What is it you think those men
were trying to protect? Census data?

42:09.874 --> 42:11.603
You need me worse than you know.

42:11.843 --> 42:15.574
I don't need someone using me
to get another man killed.

42:15.813 --> 42:17.440
You think this is about Mulder?

42:17.515 --> 42:19.278
It's about the truth,John.

42:19.350 --> 42:21.818
What truth?

42:21.886 --> 42:23.911
You got it all right in front of you.

42:23.988 --> 42:26.320
It's all in the X-Files.

42:26.390 --> 42:31.191
I'm just one man trying to point you
in the right direction.

43:46.604 --> 43:48.606
[ Child ]
I made this.

43:48.606 --> 43:50.631
[ Child ]
l made this.
