WEBVTT

01:47.524 --> 01:49.275
How did you get this number?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.861
- That's not important.
- It's important to me.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.113
Charlie, this is the first of several calls

01:54.198 --> 01:57.200
and its only purpose is to demonstrate
my credibility as a source.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.410
How about you tell me your name?

01:59.495 --> 02:00.703
Call me Deep Throat.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.165
I'm not calling you Deep Throat.
That's a sacred pseudonym.

02:04.249 --> 02:08.836
And by the way, Deep Throat gave
Woodward his name on the first call.

02:08.921 --> 02:13.424
He said, "Hi, this is Mark Felt.
I'm the Deputy Director of the FBI

02:13.550 --> 02:16.677
"and I want to talk to you about
this story you're writing."

02:16.762 --> 02:18.971
- So who is this?
- I don't care what you call me.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.306
Call me Late for Dinner.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.935
I'm not calling to give you a tip.
I'm simply establishing my credibility.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.479
But you're not establishing your credibility.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.731
- I'm about to.
- Go ahead.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.942
In roughly 90 minutes,
you're going to get an email

02:31.026 --> 02:33.110
from the White House
telling you to get to work.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.404
- I am?
- That's it.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.574
Should I be telling people to get to work now?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.160
- And do what?
- You tell me.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.662
If I could, I would have already.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.831
I'm not trying to play a game.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.165
I have 7:30.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.167
At 9:00 Eastern, you're going to get an email

02:48.252 --> 02:51.671
from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney
telling you to get to work.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.006
And when that happens,
you'll know that I was for real.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.843
- Is anyone in danger?
- No.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.302
If someone's in danger
and you're not telling...

02:58.387 --> 03:01.347
No one's in danger, Charlie.
This isn't a scary call.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.808
I'm just establishing my credibility.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.770
Why? Why do you need me
to believe you're credible?

03:08.814 --> 03:10.439
Hello?

03:16.405 --> 03:18.447
- What was that?
- I don't know.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.949
You should probably say a few words.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.033
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.869
- What do I say?
- What do you want to say?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.787
"Please get out of my home"?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.832
Everyone, Will wants to say a few words.

03:27.916 --> 03:32.461
I really don't. But here you all are
in my apartment, socializing.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.132
Coworkers, friends, family...

03:36.216 --> 03:37.842
In my apartment

03:37.926 --> 03:39.635
just like in my nightmares.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.680
This is a party to celebrate
the one year and one week anniversary

03:42.764 --> 03:45.516
of what we used to call News Night 2.0.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.643
Remember that?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.563
And I think we're up to about
News Night 174.0,

03:50.647 --> 03:53.232
but I'm confident we're gonna
get it right one of these days.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.067
So have a good time at the party.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.070
And please, please know,
from the bottom of my heart,

03:58.155 --> 04:01.073
that I'm not gonna think it's rude
if you leave early.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.912
- Good?
- Goose bumps.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.289
Resume being here.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.875
Okay, this is an Australian actress.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.710
- Nicole Kidman.
- No, she was in Spider-Man.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.713
Time. Let me see. It's Christian Bale.

04:16.048 --> 04:19.091
English, Batman and a man.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.676
Who am I thinking of?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.974
- Up chickens.
- Down chickens.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.353
- It's not there.
- Not there.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.799
Just to be clear for you youngsters,
this isn't recreational. It's medicinal.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.175
When I was a junior in high school,

05:01.259 --> 05:03.719
I was already throwing
a 74-mile-an-hour fastball,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.846
which puts a lot of stress on your landing leg.

05:05.931 --> 05:09.642
Also have epicondylitis in my elbow
due to my mess-you-up breaking ball.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.519
You know, if you just want to bake,
that's okay with me.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.938
You don't need to go to WebMD
to come up with symptoms.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.022
I don't want to bake.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.899
I'm telling you I was an
awesome high school athlete,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.318
but it's left me in constant physical pain
in my knee and elbow.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.403
And experts say that

05:20.487 --> 05:22.655
medical marijuana relieves
the pain and inflammation

05:22.739 --> 05:24.782
with fewer side effects than
prescription pain killers.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.159
- Which experts?
- The ones on WebMD.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.371
Anyway, thank you and thank your friend
in LA for getting this for me.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.164
No problem. He said they're pretty strong.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.709
So you should just break off
a quarter and eat that.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.336
And when this guy says they're strong,
they're strong.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.922
I ate two.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.969
Okay. Well, enjoy yourself
and we'll see you in 12 to 14 hours.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.973
It's fine. I have incredibly high tolerance.
That's why I can't feel the Vicodin.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.184
You took Vicodin and then ate two cookies?

05:52.728 --> 05:54.562
- Mmm-hmm.
- He's fine. You're fine.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.689
Just stay away from anything dangerous.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.358
Electricity. You know, outside.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.860
I'm fine. I don't feel it at all.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.236
- You will.
- We'll see.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.363
My body has the physical tolerance of 10 men.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.115
Doctors have called me a medical marvel.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.616
Yeah, I'd just lie down.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.035
But if you want to see a real marvel,

06:09.119 --> 06:12.788
Kaylee is going to play Jim at Guitar Hepr
and Kaylee is gonna be blindfolded.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.957
- You should come watch.
- I will.

06:16.835 --> 06:20.796
Look at this. It's from Mike Tapley.
"I'm available. Call me."

06:21.590 --> 06:24.633
That's how you ask someone out?
"I'm available. Call me"?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.552
What time do you have?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.095
8:25.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.903
Boo, I just buzzed.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.863
Can you check my phone?
It's in my back pocket.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.823
It might be Jim's mom begging me to stop.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.742
I can play an actual guitar.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.911
All you have to do is declare my supremacy
and I'll stop.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.246
- It's your incoming Twitter feeds.
- Oh, read them to me.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.499
And someone tell me
if Jim's holding back tears.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.002
Someone named Monster
has a link to some epic photographs.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.090
Steve Martin says, "I like my antiques new."

07:04.174 --> 07:07.051
And The Rock's tweeting,
"Just got word that will shock the world.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.845
"Land of the free, home of the brave.
Damn proud to be an American."

07:10.680 --> 07:13.265
I guess Fast Five just won the weekend.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.351
No, that means he's coming back.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.187
The Rock is coming back to lay
the smack down on Triple H.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.191
Stop playing. You lost like ten minutes ago.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.448
Hey.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.201
Somebody said you were in here
working on a Sunday night during a party

07:32.285 --> 07:34.203
and I had no trouble believing it.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.831
I was just securing the video overnights.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.957
It's okay.

07:39.292 --> 07:43.129
It's weird how the video overnights
look so much like the Mets-Phillies game.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.214
Isn't it?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.758
- It's Lisa. You should take it.
- It's okay.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.802
She's supposed to be here.
Maybe something happened.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.846
I'm sure she's just blowing up her hair.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.639
- Blowing out her hair?
- Is that what it is?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.474
Yeah. Take the call.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.851
I think she's gone.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.103
Hi, Lis'.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.437
Hey, did I call the wrong computer?

08:00.522 --> 08:02.356
No, your man is right here.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.983
- He was just watching some porn.
- Nope.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.776
- Where are you?
- Five minutes away. I'm walking.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.319
I've got FaceTime on my phone.
Can you see me?

08:07.404 --> 08:08.529
You should be looking in front of you

08:08.613 --> 08:09.613
while you're walking or you're gonna...

08:09.698 --> 08:11.157
- What? I'm sorry.
- Christ! What the...

08:11.241 --> 08:13.450
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.369
- Okay, have a good night.
- You okay?

08:15.453 --> 08:18.539
Yeah, I walked into a pedestrian
who also has FaceTime on his phone.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.915
Please don't cross any streets.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.917
I was gonna call you
and then I saw you were online.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.752
- Aren't I coming to a party?
- Absolutely.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.213
- I just needed to do some work.
- Watch some porn.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.382
- Mets-Phillies?
- Only to check the score.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.259
Hey, check it out.
I've got a new expression I want to try.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.844
You ready? "It's a gas."

08:31.928 --> 08:33.179
- I like it.
- Try it.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.889
- It's a gas.
- Nope. Terrible.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.473
You can't do it. I'm almost there.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.517
- It'll be a gas.
- Seriously, no.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.477
- All right.
- All right, I'll be there in a minute.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.062
I love you.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.856
And I do, too.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.489
Yeah, maybe if you
stare at that piece of paper long enough,

08:52.574 --> 08:54.033
the time will reverse itself

08:54.117 --> 08:56.118
and the last ten seconds
will be erased from the universe.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.871
All right, first of all, can we agree that

08:58.955 --> 09:02.499
sometimes being this connected
by technology does more harm...

09:02.584 --> 09:04.585
"I love you" and "I do, too"?

09:04.669 --> 09:08.547
Here's what happened.
Lisa told me she loved me last night.

09:08.632 --> 09:09.798
- She did?
- Yes.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.551
- She does that too early.
- I completely agree.

09:12.636 --> 09:13.636
Save your agreement,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.429
'cause I don't think
we're on the same side on this one.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.014
How do you feel about that?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.225
Her? How do you feel about her?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.893
- I don't feel the same way.
- You don't?

09:20.977 --> 09:27.149
I like her. She's really nice
and really funny and incredibly sexy.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.402
Really very sexy with the sexiness that...

09:30.487 --> 09:33.113
- I get it.
- And I like the new expression.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.282
- It's a gas.
- Don't even.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.951
- But I don't love her.
- You don't?

09:37.035 --> 09:38.077
No.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.080
So what did you say
when she said, "I love you?"

09:41.164 --> 09:43.040
- I said, "I love you, too."
- Of course you did.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.168
- Anything else seemed rude.
- And then you just told her again.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.631
No, what I said was, "And I do, too."
Which means that I love me.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.801
And I do.
I look in the mirror and I like what I see.

09:53.885 --> 09:57.346
And I've been on a journey of self-discovery
to answer the question who is Jim Harper...

09:57.430 --> 09:58.889
- Shut up.
- Okay.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.850
You can't keep telling her
you love her if you don't.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.770
Which is why, frankly,
I would have preferred not to take the call.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.022
You think blaming me
is gonna be a winning strategy?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.275
- No.
- What are you gonna do now?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.776
Well, obviously I have to leave the country.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.612
- You have to break up with her.
- Why?

10:13.697 --> 10:15.364
You can't have a relationship

10:15.448 --> 10:19.618
where one person's here
and the other person's there.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.495
Really? Where's Don?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.080
Don's on a plane back from D.C.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.124
And was that a dig wrapped in a metaphor?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.376
- No.
- I think it was a dig wrapped in a metaphor.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.337
- I have to break up with her?
- Yes.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.215
You don't think that's gonna come
as a surprise after I told her I loved her?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.051
I do, yes. I think it'll be a surprise.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.428
I'll write her a nice letter.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.013
- No.
- Everybody likes getting mail.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.890
You're not overseas fighting World War I.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.976
You have to do it in person
and you have to do it tonight.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.602
- In the middle of a party?
- No.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.855
When she gets here,
you'll tell her you'd like to take a walk.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.606
Hang on.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.734
- And she's not that sexy.
- Yes, she is.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.069
Just because of her sweet face?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.572
Yeah, that's it.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.198
- I think...
- It's from Mike Tapley.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.659
"I'm available. Call me."

11:00.744 --> 11:01.994
Why would Tapley want me to call him?

11:02.078 --> 11:05.748
I mean, I get that she has physical attributes
that are prized by

11:05.832 --> 11:07.333
- the superficial male.
- Hey. Tapley?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.626
Our own National Security analyst.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.920
Stay here and look around
and find out what he's talking about.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.673
- Where do I start?
- Start by emailing him back

11:14.758 --> 11:16.592
and asking, "What are you talking about?"

11:16.676 --> 11:18.677
Do not take a tone with me, American Gigolo.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.888
I wasn't...

11:25.143 --> 11:26.935
- Hey, listen.
- Sing more.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.146
No, I just got a strange email
from Mike Tapley.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.232
- So did I.
- It said, "I'm available. Call me."

11:32.776 --> 11:35.027
Why is he hitting on both of us?

11:35.904 --> 11:39.365
He's not hitting on either one of you.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.284
He's saying he's available to go on the air.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.078
- For what?
- When?

11:44.162 --> 11:46.538
- Now.
- What are you talking about?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.083
Wait for it.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.844
- "Get to work."
- Who's it from?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.388
The White House. What does yours say?

12:02.472 --> 12:08.352
"POTUS to address the country at 10:30 EST
on matter of national security."

12:10.397 --> 12:11.438
Hang on.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.901
- It's Kaylee, right?
- What's wrong?

12:15.985 --> 12:19.238
The Rock, he has a cousin
who's a Navy SEAL?

12:19.322 --> 12:22.074
- Yeah.
- And tell me what his tweet said.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.492
Um...

12:26.663 --> 12:28.372
"Just got word that will shock the world.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.625
"Land of the free, home of the brave.
Damn proud to be an American."

12:31.709 --> 12:34.420
- He's coming back to avenge Triple H.
- No, he's not.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.422
Everybody, quiet down.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.715
Will, turn off the music.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.427
Turn it off.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.054
Martin, throw me the remote.
It's right next to you.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.560
Fine.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.104
Martin, throw me the remote.
It's right next to you.

12:54.232 --> 12:58.026
The President's speaking
in 90 minutes on a matter of national security.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.528
That's all we know right now.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.824
30 minutes from now,
I want to know a lot more than that.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.410
Four people to a cab. Let's go.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.120
What do you think it is?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.788
It could be Qaddafi.
It could be Iran.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.290
They could have fired on a ship in the Gulf.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.125
Jimmy Carter just got back from North Korea.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.377
He could have learned something.
We could be under attack.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.546
But what do you think it is?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.549
I think we got bin Laden.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.969
- How many people does your lift hold?
- What?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.554
Your elevator, how many people can it hold?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.306
- Six.
- Call down to the doorman.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.224
- Just up and down, no stops.
- Yeah. Lonny!

13:29.392 --> 13:32.269
I'm bringing the car around.
Look, you stand in the lobby.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.104
- Do not go out on the sidewalk.
- Yeah.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.732
Guys, get Lonny in the elevator.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.067
- Right.
- What is going on?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.278
There's breaking news
and we don't know what it is,

13:41.362 --> 13:42.988
but the President's gonna go on TV at 10:30.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.615
- You don't know what it is?
- No.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.200
Can I come watch? I'll sit in the corner.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.202
Sure. Yeah.
But once you're there, you can't leave

13:48.286 --> 13:49.578
and you can't communicate with anyone.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.288
Okay. What do you think is going on?

13:51.372 --> 13:55.626
We don't know. But I have to be honest,
it can only be very good or very bad.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.673
It's almost, I don't know. It's almost...

14:01.758 --> 14:03.091
- Like she's trying too hard.
- Yeah.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.928
Like she's trying too hard
to show you everything's fine.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.888
It's almost like that.
It's right near being like that.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.348
What are you guys talking about?

14:09.432 --> 14:11.099
- Don thinks that Maggie's...
- Too loud.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.309
...trying too hard to create the appearance

14:12.393 --> 14:13.435
that she's happy in their relationship.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
Full plane. Man sitting right here.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.188
You've yammered about
your love life for two weeks...

14:16.272 --> 14:18.315
- Wow. Bizarrely loud.
- Last night at the Correspondents' Dinner.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.650
I'm a financial news reporter

14:19.734 --> 14:21.401
and the Secretary of the Treasury
turned around and said,

14:21.486 --> 14:23.153
"When's he gonna shut up about Maggie?"

14:23.238 --> 14:24.655
That was really embarrassing for me

14:24.739 --> 14:26.865
and it came right after
I accidentally set him on fire.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.325
Hey, don't turn on your phones yet.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.369
- We haven't touched the ground.
- I turn mine on at 500 feet.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.287
I turn mine on when I see
someone else turn theirs on.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.622
It messes with the navigation.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.082
The runway is right in front of him.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.293
Do you use your car's navigation system
to get from your driveway to your garage?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.964
I don't have a driveway, a garage, or a car,
but why don't we assume the pilot knows...

14:42.048 --> 14:44.049
Hey, sir, can you take his phone away?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.134
He's endangering your life
and the lives of the other passengers.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.930
I'm not. I'm not.
She set the Treasury Secretary on fire.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.599
- It's true.
- Why?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.269
Just to show the other cabinet secretaries
that I could.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.650
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to New York's LaGuardia Airport

15:01.734 --> 15:04.778
where the current time is
seven minutes past 9:00.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.363
- We ask that you...
- You okay now?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.240
Or are you worried he can't
find the airport from here?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.575
I'm all about safety.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.745
Yeah, I'm sure if we went to the burn unit,
Timothy Geithner would say that... Damn it.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.581
My phone was on the whole time.
It's out of juice.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.249
Could you guys scroll through your messages

15:17.333 --> 15:18.584
and see if there's anything I need to know?

15:18.668 --> 15:22.671
It's my daughter. "Daddy,
are you the smartest man in the world?"

15:22.755 --> 15:23.839
- Yes.
- Scroll.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.925
"Miss Sabbith, a lady always
buttons her top button.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.553
"If you buttoned your collar on television,
you would be a lady.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.848
"If you spilled water all over your front,
I would like that, too."

15:34.726 --> 15:35.726
It's a fan.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.936
- Scroll, scroll.
- Shit.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.439
Jesus.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.983
Hey, do you have this?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.279
Excuse me, would you mind
just switching seats with that woman?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.072
- We're almost at the gate.
- I know it sounds crazy,

15:49.157 --> 15:50.782
but would you do it for me?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.117
Well, can I get your number?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.619
- No.
- Sure. I will give you her number.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.870
Come on.
If you'd just give me a chance...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.079
How old are you?

15:56.164 --> 15:59.207
- I'm old enough.
- I will give you a chance.

15:59.292 --> 16:03.378
Your first test is will you switch seats
without asking for anything in return?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.547
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.966
You have to stay seated
until we're at the gate.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.426
- Points for trying?
- Throw me your phone.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.345
- You think they're still at the party?
- Not anymore.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.846
Guys, wait till we're off the plane.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.972
There's just too much we don't know

16:14.057 --> 16:15.891
and too many words
we don't want to say out loud.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.643
- What's going on?
- See?

16:17.727 --> 16:19.519
No, I mean the plane's stopping.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.147
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.650
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.901
We arrived ten minutes early

16:25.985 --> 16:28.070
and ground traffic control
doesn't have a gate for us.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.363
No, no, no.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.782
It'll be just a few minutes
and then we'll have you on your way.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.700
All right, you guys
mind switching seats now?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.911
Hey, remember, I've already proven myself
with the first test.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.704
Excuse me.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.748
- You have to stay seated.
- But we're stopped.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.167
We're still on the taxiway.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.379
You have to stay seated
until the captain turns off the seat belt sign.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.047
Ma'am, this is a bit of an emergency.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.758
Sir, FAA rules require
passengers to stay seated...

16:49.842 --> 16:51.551
- Sure.
...with their seat belts fastened

16:51.636 --> 16:53.387
until we're safely at the gate and the captain...

16:53.471 --> 16:55.389
- Got it.
...has turned off the seat belt sign.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.973
It's not just for your safety.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.684
You could fall into
one of the other passengers.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.352
- Understood, ma'am.
- Please don't make me tell you again.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.814
If I can just say this, we're stopped. Right?

17:03.898 --> 17:05.691
And the pilot just said that
it would be a few minutes.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.277
Now, if the plane does start moving
while my colleague and...

17:09.362 --> 17:11.405
- Lester.
...Lester are changing seats,

17:11.489 --> 17:13.031
it'll be going two miles an hour.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.326
Up there, you let us stand and move around
and we were going like 550.

17:16.411 --> 17:21.665
So I thought maybe we could apply logic
and see where that took us.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.875
Insulting me is not gonna help you out much.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.503
- I wasn't insulting you.
- I can't get anybody to answer their phone.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.671
You're calling people who are on the subway.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.839
Call people who are in taxis.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.298
You have to let us off this plane.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.426
I'm not letting you unbuckle your seat belt.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.094
You think I'm letting you off the plane?

17:34.178 --> 17:37.305
If you knew what we know, which is nothing,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.350
you'd be behind us and they'd be behind us

17:40.435 --> 17:41.977
and I think later on tonight
you're gonna be saying,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.979
"I wish I'd been more cooperative
with that passenger."

17:44.522 --> 17:46.314
I think later on tonight
you're gonna be saying,

17:46.399 --> 17:48.900
"These handcuffs hurt my wrists."

17:49.444 --> 17:51.737
All right, she's not easy.
I need information now.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.488
If they knew more, they'd be telling us, right?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.907
We'll keep calling the desk,
but I think we're just gonna have to wait.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.077
Waiting, patience...
Words like that, always my last option.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.079
Borrow somebody's phone and start dialing.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.583
Lester.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.669
Andy, listen, most of my staff are kids.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.046
Five years ago, half of them
were editing their college newspapers.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.089
Will, we can't...

18:11.174 --> 18:12.215
You just got to give me a little guidance.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.301
We think it's bin Laden.
If we're wrong, just wave me off.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.635
I can't do any waving.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.346
All right, we're gonna do a Carl Bernstein
from All the President's Men.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.391
I'm gonna say, "It's bin Laden"
and I'm gonna count to ten.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.602
If you don't say anything,
that's what we're pursuing.

18:23.686 --> 18:27.272
Ready? One...

18:27.356 --> 18:28.982
Two...

18:30.276 --> 18:32.527
Wait a second.
That's where they fucked up in the movie.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.862
- I've got to go, man.
- Are you gonna...

18:33.946 --> 18:35.781
The guy misunderstood the directions.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.365
Andy?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.578
We're not moving.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.705
- There's construction.
- On a Sunday night?

18:43.831 --> 18:46.124
They do it on Sunday night
so they don't inconvenience people.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.627
This is gonna be a great city
once they finish building it.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.253
Just sit tight.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.297
What are we, 22 blocks away?

18:52.381 --> 18:53.965
I'm gonna get you there.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.302
I'm gonna run.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.179
- No, you're not.
- I can run fast.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.931
You can't get out of the car without me.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.853
I see you thinking about it.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.522
Do not do it.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.070
What are you putting that in your pocket for?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.908
Motherfucker!

19:24.163 --> 19:27.040
Get back here! You are not safe out here!

19:27.124 --> 19:29.835
McAvoy, get back! God damn it.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.212
- Sir, is there a problem?
- There's a guy running west.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.673
- He's gonna go north on 5th.
- Just calm down.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.007
I'm calm, Officer. But that man cannot...

19:36.092 --> 19:38.301
- Please step back in your vehicle.
- The keys are inside.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.845
Could you just move it over to the side?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.638
- I'm private security.
- Calm down and step back.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.722
- Please, listen to me.
- Turn around

19:42.807 --> 19:43.807
and place your hands on the car.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.891
- Officer.
- Turn around

19:44.976 --> 19:47.018
and place your hands on the car.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.104
- I'm gonna kill him.
- What was that?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.357
- Officers, I'm armed.
- He said he's armed.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.860
- Put your hands on the car.
- I'm licensed to carry.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.361
And there's a weapon
currently on your person?

19:56.445 --> 19:58.363
Under my jacket on my left side.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.865
It's loaded with the safety on.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.908
My carry permit's in my back right pocket.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.870
I work for Blue North Security
and my client is at large.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.496
You're a big guy, okay?

20:06.581 --> 20:08.748
Don't do anything
that's gonna make us nervous.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.626
Nothing I can do about being big and black
at the same time.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.382
You guys, you can sit anywhere over here.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.385
The kitchen is back there with...

20:22.138 --> 20:24.139
- With...
- Pop-Tarts.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.724
Why did you choose Pop-Tarts?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.226
I don't know, but you were
never gonna finish that sentence.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.644
Just sit tight. And remember,

20:29.729 --> 20:32.480
you're not gonna hear
please and thank you a lot.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.692
How long does it take
to get the studio warmed up?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.486
15 minutes. And the control room
is warming up right now.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.696
You talking to D. C?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.406
They'll start rolling coverage in 20 minutes.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.241
- Of what?
- A live shot of the White House.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.618
Let them know New York's running this

20:44.702 --> 20:46.870
and they don't say a word
until Charlie says okay.

20:46.954 --> 20:47.954
Any idea when we're breaking?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.456
President speaks in 45 minutes.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.499
If we know something before then, we'll go.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.256
Gary. Have you tried Gary?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.759
Quiet. Quiet!

21:02.887 --> 21:04.679
Let's get organized.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.432
What exactly do we know? And I mean know.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.644
The President is speaking at 10:30
on a matter of national security.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.562
- What else?
- That's it.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.147
Okay, that's exactly
what we knew 20 minutes ago.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.484
Just to be clear,
he's breaking into the networks, too.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.445
That's Desperate Housewives,
Celebrity Apprentice, Brothers & Sisters.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.280
That's a ton of money in ad givebacks.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.574
- This can't wait till the morning.
- It's bin Laden, Mac.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.034
We want it to be bin Laden.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.495
Let's not let the wish
be the father of the thought.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.288
Obviously we're pursuing bin Laden.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.040
But let's just talk about what else it could be.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.751
- Qaddafi.
- Follow it. Put together a team out there.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.294
A foreign attack.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.463
No one at State or DOD is talking, right?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.882
If they're not clamming up,
they honestly don't know anything.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.135
Who did the Santa Tracker story
at Christmas? Anyone?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.679
When we get the guy from NORAD
on the phone,

21:45.763 --> 21:48.848
and they report they're tracking
a big sled with reindeer.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.934
- I did.
- Get him on the phone.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.145
You think the Santa guy
is gonna know something?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.648
I'd be pretty surprised,
but I'm not doing nothing.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.985
What about outside the box?
Way, way outside the box?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.987
- All right. Here I go.
- What?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.656
A study published
in The Astrophysical Journal estimates

22:04.740 --> 22:07.951
there are ten trillion planetary systems
in the known universe.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.286
- Which one are you from?
- She said "outside the box."

22:10.371 --> 22:14.124
Then she added, "way, way outside the box."

22:14.208 --> 22:17.419
Besides the near certainty that
intelligent life exists outside this planet...

22:17.503 --> 22:21.006
Are you suggesting that we've made contact
with beings from another planet?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.008
Is that your suggestion?

22:23.634 --> 22:26.344
- You said way outside the box.
- Come back in the box.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.179
- The birth certificate.
- What about it?

22:28.264 --> 22:31.266
What if the long form's a forgery
and the president's resigning?

22:31.350 --> 22:34.144
I think it's more likely that
ET is standing on the Truman Balcony.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.104
- So should I follow...
- No.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.982
Where's Will?

22:40.234 --> 22:41.443
Okay, where's Elliot?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.987
Elliot, Sloan, and Don...

22:44.071 --> 22:47.115
We're able to communicate with them,
but they're stuck on the tarmac at LaGuardia.

22:47.241 --> 22:50.994
All right, Maggie,
dust off the obit packages for bin Laden.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.370
Tess, you're on Qaddafi.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.330
Jim, do what you do
and get us new information

22:54.415 --> 22:57.042
and get the bookers to line up
our National Security guys.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.502
You can start with Mike Tapley,
who's available.

22:59.587 --> 23:00.962
Let's go.

23:06.469 --> 23:07.677
What?

23:07.762 --> 23:10.263
The President's gonna tell us
what's going on at 10:30.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.473
He's going to tell us.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.143
What's the virtue of breaking it
five minutes early?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.063
America thinks bin Laden's alive.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.648
If I can make him dead one minute sooner,

23:20.733 --> 23:24.319
my entire life in journalism up until this point
will have been worth it.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.780
All right.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.034
I got a White House usher
who says they're bringing

23:31.118 --> 23:32.952
a backup generator into the East Room.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.788
Mac, he's speaking from the East Room.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.498
Presidents don't announce
bad news from the East Room.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.625
They do it from the Oval Office
or the Briefing Room.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.503
All right, good. Listen...

23:41.587 --> 23:44.214
You don't think there's any
chance it's a UFO, do you?

23:44.298 --> 23:45.673
Keep it together, would you?

23:50.221 --> 23:52.514
- She's in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.312
- What do you have?
- What, is this your boyfriend?

23:59.396 --> 24:01.272
- Yes.
- No. Yes.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.067
Look, I'm not the kind of guy
that likes to play games.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.569
- He's with Maggie.
- Thanks, Pete.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.696
- What'd you find?
- According to FlyersRights. Org,

24:08.781 --> 24:10.907
we can download a petition
demanding we be allowed off the plane,

24:10.991 --> 24:12.784
but it's not clear
how many signatures we need.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.744
We don't have time to circulate a petition.
What else you got?

24:14.829 --> 24:16.788
A website that lists seven ways
to get kicked off a plane,

24:16.872 --> 24:18.581
including shouting loud,
unpopular political views.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.624
I can do that.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.251
Being dressed in an inappropriately
revealing manner.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.753
- Take off your clothes.
- You take off your clothes.

24:23.838 --> 24:24.963
I guess I'm stuck with the tiebreaker.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.006
Lester, I'm gonna lose my shit on you.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.221
- Generator in the East Room.
- It's not bad news.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.350
Elliot, let's try...

24:40.729 --> 24:43.439
Boy, that Genghis Khan
had some pretty good ideas.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.108
- You see what happened?
- Yes.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.068
The worst thing that could possibly happen.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.529
I fell down and guess what? Nobody died.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.906
Get in your seat, fasten your seat belt.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.700
Sure, but I might need to see
that demonstration again

24:53.784 --> 24:56.035
'cause I've never seen a seat belt before.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.919
He's stopping.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.463
The gate's right there.
It's right out the window.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.049
I can see it.
I'm practically touching it right now.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.926
- Take it easy.
- It's right there!

25:12.011 --> 25:14.179
Well, folks,
this is the captain.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.972
- Good news, our gate has opened up.
- Thank you.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.558
- But this is a tow-in gate.
- No!

25:18.642 --> 25:20.852
So it'll be just a few more minutes.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.020
Let me out!

25:22.104 --> 25:25.607
Let me out
and I will push the plane to the gate.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.109
Maggie's a lucky girl.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.531
No one's asked us to switch over
to the Emergency Broadcasting System,

25:33.616 --> 25:36.743
so there isn't a North Korean missile
headed towards San Diego.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.453
No one knows anything at the CDC,

25:38.537 --> 25:42.790
so a vial of smallpox hasn't been dropped
in the middle of Madison Square Garden.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.210
We have a computer that monitors
all the police scanners

25:45.294 --> 25:46.961
and listens for certain words.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.380
There's been no act of domestic terrorism,

25:49.465 --> 25:53.092
though there is a frat party at Michigan State
that's about to get broken up.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.054
You guys know it's bin Laden, don't you?

25:56.513 --> 25:59.599
Believe me,
when we know it's bin Laden, you'll know.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.226
I'd have expected it to be a lot more chaotic.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.644
Since the first day MacKenzie got here,

26:02.728 --> 26:04.103
we've been practicing this once a month.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.230
We do dry runs.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.440
Obviously there are always
wild cards you can't predict.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.484
Hey, little buddy.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.653
- Oh, boy.
- Are you all right?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.696
- Yeah.
- Mac's been worried.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.574
We got stuck in some traffic, so I ran here.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.368
We've been calling.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.954
I thought it would be better to keep running
than answer the phone.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.538
What's that?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.499
I stopped to get a falafel.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.168
I'm just gonna...

26:29.421 --> 26:32.090
Good. Thanks. Anything new?

26:32.174 --> 26:33.675
It's bin Laden or Qaddafi.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.094
And the White House pushed it
15 minutes to 10:45.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.263
God.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.765
Have you ever noticed
how we've never been able to agree

26:40.849 --> 26:42.767
on a way to spell Qaddafi?

26:42.851 --> 26:45.228
"Q-A," "K-A," "G."

26:45.688 --> 26:46.729
Will, are you able to...

26:46.814 --> 26:48.564
Qaddafi would have been a NATO operation.

26:48.649 --> 26:52.110
I've spoken with Wesley Clark,
who called NATO HQ in Brussels.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.361
They don't know anything.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.905
You've already spoken to NATO HQ?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.324
When I was getting the falafel.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.328
Kaylee.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.790
I need to be able to count on your discretion.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.376
You can't imagine how important this night is.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.381
You're gonna be great.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.967
Just keep drinking water.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.552
All right.

27:19.847 --> 27:23.474
So I'm gonna go in my office and...

27:23.559 --> 27:25.310
Take it from there.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.980
So if it's not Qaddafi, doesn't that mean...

27:29.064 --> 27:31.899
Like I said, when we have it confirmed,
you'll know it.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.611
Go back to work.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.071
Yeah.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.907
You can see
the Press Briefing Room is empty.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.452
The White House Press Corps
is starting to arrive on the scene,

27:42.536 --> 27:46.497
but they're staking out positions
near the northwest executive entrance.

27:46.582 --> 27:50.043
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Yup.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.253
Keith Urbahn, who's the Chief of Staff
for Donald Rumsfeld,

27:52.338 --> 27:53.755
has tweeted the following,

27:53.839 --> 27:57.884
"So I'm told by a reputable person
they have killed Osama bin Laden. Hot damn."

27:58.052 --> 28:00.470
- We got the tweet.
- We want to report it.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.555
- You can't do it.
- We're not gonna say confirmed.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.848
We just want to report the tweet.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.851
Jane, this is double confirmation territory,
and we don't even have one yet.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.227
The tweet is reportable.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.021
Do you know how many tweets
there are out there?

28:10.105 --> 28:12.690
Just one from the Chief of Staff
to the former Secretary of Defense.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.859
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to keep vamping.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.362
We've got a package on past live addresses
from the East Room.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.446
We'll shoot it to you.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.491
Mac, we're eight blocks from the White House.
We'd like to report some news.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.493
Then go get some, Jane.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.036
Will's here.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.288
- Mac?
- Back to you, Jane.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.043
The President was scheduled
to address the nation at 10:30.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.046
But we have been told it
will be closer to 10:45.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.758
If you're just joining us, I'll recap everything
we're able to report.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.051
It shouldn't take long.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.348
Thank God. Where have you been?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.350
There was construction.
I have to get on the air.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.060
- What do you want to say?
- It's not Qaddafi.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.812
We've got NATO saying it's not Libya.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.855
And we've got London and Paris
saying it's not Qaddafi.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.649
- It's not Qaddafi.
- So who's saying it is?

28:56.068 --> 28:59.028
Continuing what we have assumed
that Qaddafi...

28:59.113 --> 29:01.364
It has something to do with Qaddafi.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.409
Do you agree with the general
that the war in Libya will continue

29:04.493 --> 29:06.786
or do you think that the death of Qaddafi...

29:06.870 --> 29:08.246
Jesus Christ.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.497
Let them know New York is ready.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.583
I'm just gonna go on, say it's not Libya,
and then throw it back to Washington

29:12.668 --> 29:14.377
- until we have a double confirmation.
- Good.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.379
Okay, so let's let them
know New York is ready.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.089
I'm just gonna go on, say it's not Libya,

29:18.173 --> 29:21.175
and then throw it back to Washington
until we have double confirmation.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.052
You just said that.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.303
Hmm?

29:24.388 --> 29:25.805
You all right?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.099
I just think this is some kind of trick tie.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.976
- I can't get it to...
- What's the problem?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.937
I can't remember how to tie a Windsor knot.

29:33.021 --> 29:36.357
And I can tie
a square knot and a sheepshank.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.360
- Will?
- But that's not useful right now.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.571
What is wrong with you?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.657
I'm wasted, okay?

29:44.741 --> 29:47.118
- I'm completely baked.
- What?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.078
- I had... Okay, listen.
- Oh, no.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.872
- No, no, it's okay.
- Oh, my God.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.748
Listen, Neal's girlfriend...
And you should see her,

29:52.833 --> 29:54.459
she can play Guitar Hepr blindfolded.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.502
- Oh, my God.
- No, you're right. It doesn't matter.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.629
Let me back it up. When you're pitching,

29:58.714 --> 30:01.048
you have your push-off leg
and your landing leg.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.550
That landing leg, as you can see,

30:02.634 --> 30:05.136
takes a lot of force
when you come down on it like that.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.638
Boom. Like that. And marijuana...

30:07.723 --> 30:09.891
- This isn't happening. You can't do this.
...is suggested.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.642
- I'm a medical marvel.
- You can't go on the air.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.978
My body has the melatolical tolerance of...

30:14.062 --> 30:16.022
- "Metabolical."
- What did I say?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.482
- Will!
- MacKenzie, listen to me.

30:17.566 --> 30:23.446
There is no way, no way
I'm not reporting this story.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.911
You understand, right?

30:32.581 --> 30:34.290
Of course.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.125
I'm not gonna let you down.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.087
I know.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.677
Hey, we got Obama.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.679
I mean, bin Laden. Shh!

30:48.764 --> 30:50.765
I got that one out of my system.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.309
Let's think of the people who would know.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.102
- Well, POTUS.
- V-POTUS.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.938
- Head of JSOC.
- Bill McRaven.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.147
- Gates.
- Panetta.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.608
- Guys.
- Lt was either Delta, SEAL Six,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.235
- or a bullet from the CIA.
- Guys.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.403
- What about a drone?
- I don't think they'd use a drone.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.155
They'd want an immediate positive ID.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.241
Guys!

31:08.909 --> 31:11.202
What does EKIA mean?

31:14.623 --> 31:16.249
It means, "Enemy killed in action."

31:17.459 --> 31:19.293
I have the first confirmation.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.712
With the White House now telling us

31:21.797 --> 31:23.798
that the President's address
has been pushed back

31:23.882 --> 31:26.300
another 15 minutes to 11:00.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.095
You will know everything
we know as we know it.

31:29.179 --> 31:32.848
And in the meantime, let's go back
to Jane Barrow in Washington. Jane.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.769
- Don just called. We got the first confirmation.
- From who?

31:36.853 --> 31:38.229
Chris Harkin at CENTCOM.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.147
CENTCOM in Tampa. That's one.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.024
- Mac, we got the second confirmation.
- From who?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.234
- New York Times.
- You're kidding.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.111
Helene Cooperjust posted
she has it from two sources.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.988
Maggie.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.741
We've got Chris Harkin at CENTCOM
and Helene Cooper at the New York Times.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.081
- We got him.
- Let's go.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.667
- No.
- What do you mean?

31:59.960 --> 32:02.169
- We're not going yet.
- We've got double confirmation.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.089
First of all, we don't.
We have Harkin at CENTCOM

32:05.173 --> 32:07.300
and a reporter saying she has two sources.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.011
- I don't know who the sources are.
- It's Helene Cooper.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.013
- It's solid.
- We're not going.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.140
- Charlie.
- There's nothing wrong

32:14.224 --> 32:17.226
with waiting for the White House
to tell us it's reportable.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.354
This isn't Watergate. They're not the enemy.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.440
We don't know what's going on.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.526
We sent military assets
into sovereign airspace.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.069
Maybe they're not out yet.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.488
Maybe someone's injured on the ground.

32:29.573 --> 32:33.784
Maybe someone's been taken prisoner
and the rescue operation is underway.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.203
Maybe we're at war with Pakistan.

32:37.706 --> 32:42.543
Guys, in '91,

32:42.628 --> 32:44.962
I was cheering on my guy in Tel Aviv

32:45.047 --> 32:48.049
who was reporting
where the Scud missiles were landing.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.595
Turns out the Iraqis didn't know
where the missiles were landing

32:52.679 --> 32:56.057
and I was helping them range their targets.

33:00.854 --> 33:03.105
Three killed,

33:03.190 --> 33:05.232
96 injured in that operation.

33:10.489 --> 33:15.701
Geraldo's probably still up the street
saying we're in a dogfight with Finland.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.956
Whatever happened tonight,

33:21.041 --> 33:23.250
I promise you,

33:23.335 --> 33:26.253
lives and a presidency were put on the line.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.549
We're going to get this one right.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.259
And if we're two minutes late,

33:32.344 --> 33:36.514
let that be a small penance
for all the ones we got wrong.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.604
Agreed.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.650
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.238
Hmm?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.074
What's wrong with him?

33:55.158 --> 33:56.283
Nothing.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.204
Charlie, I do think you should tell them.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.290
That I'd love to do.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.212
Can everybody quiet down?

34:08.296 --> 34:09.630
Everybody quiet down.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.924
Charlie would like to
tell you something.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.513
I need to tell you

34:17.597 --> 34:21.142
that you're going to remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.353
It's going to be a long night
and we need you to work fast

34:24.438 --> 34:25.730
and we need you to work well.

34:25.814 --> 34:29.150
But once in a while, take three seconds...

34:29.234 --> 34:30.901
You can't spare more than that,

34:30.986 --> 34:34.113
take three seconds to notice

34:34.197 --> 34:37.658
where you are and what you're doing.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.662
Will's gonna go on the air in a few minutes

34:41.747 --> 34:43.873
so that we can report that

34:43.957 --> 34:47.793
at the order of
the President of the United States,

34:47.878 --> 34:52.757
US Special Forces
have shot and killed Osama bin Laden.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.517
Get to work.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.240
You're out here.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.867
Neal's looking for you.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.415
I think word's starting to get out
we got Qaddafi.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.250
Yeah.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.087
Neal, she's out here.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.217
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.803
Hey. You should be working.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.388
I told you when we knew for sure,
you'd know it.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.598
Yeah.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.851
I just didn't want to be the skunk
at the garden party.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.645
- Why would you...
- You're not.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.191
I was an idiot.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.735
I thought it would make me feel better
when it happened.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.571
- Like an on-off switch.
- Of course it doesn't.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.908
You knew someone in one of the Towers.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.412
Her father was a partner at Cantor Fitzgerald.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.416
We've been celebrating around you all night.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.002
You should. Everybody should.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.090
- You guys should get back to work.
- Nah, it's all right.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.925
No, I want you to.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.054
All right. I'll be right inside.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.147
- He wants us to wait?
- Until the White House says it's reportable.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.692
- Aren't we the only ones with Harkin?
- As far as I know.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.986
So we are the only ones
who have double confirmation?

36:37.070 --> 36:38.070
As far as I know.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.154
- We're going.
- No.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.574
The White House just pushed the speech
another 15 minutes. We're going.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.701
If I have to bring Charlie in here
to tell you himself,

36:43.785 --> 36:46.203
he's gonna do it in a different voice.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.038
Washington's keeping
the audience warm for Will.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.999
We're getting our facts straight.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.709
We got bin Laden, what do you want?

36:51.793 --> 36:55.004
For one thing, I don't want it reported
like the Redskins won the Super Bowl.

36:55.088 --> 36:56.630
I don't believe you people.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.842
We're waiting for the White House
to tell us it's reportable.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.469
- We're not.
- Jane. Jane!

37:03.305 --> 37:05.514
- Okay, I've just received...
- Cut the fiber from Washington.

37:05.599 --> 37:06.807
- It'll go black.
- Yeah.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.100
- Cut the fiber.
- Copy.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.654
You think she got the message yet?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.198
- Couple of more seconds.
-  Okay.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.869
Bring 'em back.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.163
- Hi.
- Damn it, Mac.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.791
Move one inch in that direction again
and you're blacked out for the night.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.877
The decision to go will be made

37:34.961 --> 37:38.005
by the president of the news division,
Charlie Skinner.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.590
And the announcement will be made

37:39.674 --> 37:44.011
by the face and voice of Atlantis Cable News,
Will McAvoy.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.515
Keep an eye on her.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.278
What are you working on?

38:01.363 --> 38:03.280
Will asked me to look over his intro copy.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.823
Wow, that's a compliment.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.284
I know Charlie's right,
but I wish we'd get on there.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.786
This is just counter-intuitive.

38:08.870 --> 38:12.247
So's Lisa being attracted to you,
but you still have to deal with that.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.041
Are you kidding? I'm not doing it tonight.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.417
- You have to.
- Tonight?

38:15.710 --> 38:17.711
You can't sleep with her again.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.714
Why are you sure I would?

38:21.383 --> 38:24.635
"She is very sexy because
of her sexy sexiness

38:24.719 --> 38:28.138
- "and the very sexual sexiocity of the..."
- Fine.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.390
Tell me what you're gonna say.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.558
- I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna say.
- You need to rehearse.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.352
- I don't need to rehearse.
- You wanna be like Spider-Man?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.145
- I'd love to.
- The musical.

38:35.230 --> 38:38.691
They didn't have enough rehearsal
and actors died, Jim.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.317
They lost their lives.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.277
I don't think anybody died.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.988
Well, they got bruised pretty bad.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.490
So tell me what you're gonna say.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.827
Lisa, you kind of took me by surprise
last night when you told...

38:49.911 --> 38:51.495
She's coming over. Dummy up.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.206
Okay. Thank God we're not
in the middle of breaking news.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.499
Hey.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.751
You mind if I talk to Jim a second?

38:57.836 --> 39:01.005
No. I'll be right there at my desk.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.589
- It's right there.
- Where?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.675
Right there.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.635
- I'm sorry, where?
- Okay.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.056
It's too bad the SEALs are in Pakistan tonight

39:11.141 --> 39:14.018
because they'd be getting some mad ass
if they were in New York City.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.192
- Lisa, I...
- This is the worst possible time,

39:22.277 --> 39:23.986
but I feel ridiculous because
you guys are talking about me

39:24.070 --> 39:25.237
and I'm standing there.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.156
No, we weren't.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.783
- Shh.
- We weren't talking about you.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.661
Last night I said something

39:32.746 --> 39:35.289
that forced you to say it, too,
and that's not fair.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.373
I didn't feel forced.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.584
This was a fix-up that you never wanted
and it went too far,

39:38.668 --> 39:41.253
and now I have to let you off the hook
because you're so nice

39:41.337 --> 39:43.005
that we'd be searching for preschools

39:43.131 --> 39:45.007
before I realized that you
were just being polite.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.678
I'm breaking up with you.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.974
Just say, "Okay."

39:56.561 --> 39:58.270
I really did like you.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.939
Just say, "Okay."

40:01.649 --> 40:05.444
Okay.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.116
I'm gonna go talk to spy girl.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.659
Get to work. That's an order.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.790
And thanks for bringing me here for this.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.835
- Look, I...
- Work.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.550
What happened?

40:28.635 --> 40:29.635
I broke up with him.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.346
He did? I mean, you did? What?

40:33.723 --> 40:35.390
I saw your face
when I was talking on the phone

40:35.475 --> 40:37.226
and he said, "I love you."

40:37.310 --> 40:39.978
He said, "I do, too."
And what are you talking about?

40:40.855 --> 40:41.980
I'm not doing this to you anymore.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.565
You're not doing anything to me. I've got Don.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.818
- I shouldn't even be standing here.
- I'm with Don.

40:45.902 --> 40:46.985
I saw your face.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.238
Come with me.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.867
- James Tiberius Harper.
- Not my middle name.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.369
Lisa is... No.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.747
Is under the impression that you broke up
with her because you have feelings for me.

40:58.832 --> 41:01.625
- I didn't break up with her at all.
- But you were about to.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.127
Any reason she needed to know that?

41:03.211 --> 41:05.003
- She already knew.
- This isn't at all embarrassing.

41:05.088 --> 41:08.924
And she is under the impression
that I also have feelings for you.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.177
- Did you hear we'd killed bin Laden?
- We're in a holding pattern.

41:12.262 --> 41:15.973
Now, can we please state clearly,
unambiguously, and for the record

41:16.057 --> 41:18.642
that neither of us likes
the other in any romantic context?

41:18.726 --> 41:21.687
- I so state.
- As do I!

41:24.399 --> 41:27.651
You guys can't begin to imagine
how unconvincing that was.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.197
Is it all right if I stay
for the President's address?

41:32.282 --> 41:35.701
Yes. But we're not nearly done
talking about this yet.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.245
- Maggie, I need you.
- Not nearly done.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.250
I'll be over there out of the way.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.253
- Wait, I...
- Just say okay.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.631
Okay.

41:59.434 --> 42:02.936
I'm the guy who wins the lottery
and loses the ticket.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.480
Biggest story in a generation
and I'm a spectator.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.357
You are not a spectator.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.735
We are locked on a plane
and we still helped put it together.

42:09.819 --> 42:10.861
That's pretty good.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.946
What is this compulsion
you have to look on the bright side?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.365
I can never count on you to be Jewish.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.952
If it helps, we should probably
be concerned about violent retaliation.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.496
That does help, man. Thanks.

42:21.623 --> 42:24.458
My regret is that I'd like to have been
with my wife for this.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.418
Tell her to wake up the kids,
bring them down to the studio.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.961
We'd all watch together.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.838
Yes, I'd like to be with your wife, too.

42:29.923 --> 42:34.009
I'd like to be in the newsroom
with Will and Charlie and her and you.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.719
- And Maggie.
- I said Maggie.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.804
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.348
So you have to ask yourself

42:39.515 --> 42:42.809
what happens when you and Maggie break up,
which you know is going to happen,

42:42.894 --> 42:45.145
and Jim's with someone else?

42:45.230 --> 42:46.563
We were talking that loud?

42:46.689 --> 42:48.857
Over Delaware after the second scotch.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.610
There's passengers in row 22
who know about you, Maggie and Jim.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.861
- True story.
- Shut up.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.906
Excuse me, I've got a text message saying

42:55.990 --> 42:57.532
the President is speaking
tonight in a few minutes.

42:57.617 --> 42:58.992
Do you know anything about this?

42:59.160 --> 43:03.413
The Internet says he's speaking
on a matter of grave national security.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.706
Yeah, I've got the same thing.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.458
I've got a flight that's been cancelled.

43:06.542 --> 43:07.709
Does that have anything to do with what...

43:07.794 --> 43:10.212
- Has there been a terrorist attack?
- No.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.923
- Wait, there's been a terrorist attack?
- No, there hasn't.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.592
I've got an email saying
we're at war with Libya.

43:15.677 --> 43:19.012
- Nope.
- You guys know what's going on, don't you?

43:21.015 --> 43:24.810
Folks, there hasn't been a terrorist attack.

43:24.894 --> 43:26.895
None of your friends and family are in danger.

43:26.980 --> 43:29.106
The President will be speaking
in just a few minutes.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.066
- No.
- Listen, they're just nervous.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.777
I don't care.
You do not take over control of the cabin.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.696
They're getting emails and going online.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.491
You do not take over control
of the cabin ever.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.910
- Now sit down. I'm getting the captain.
- Ma'am, no, you know...

43:41.995 --> 43:43.912
Yeah, get the captain,
'cause I'd like to have a word with him.

43:43.997 --> 43:45.497
The seat belt
while we're standing still is one thing,

43:45.581 --> 43:49.501
but how paranoid do you have to be to think
that I'm declaring myself in charge of the...

43:49.585 --> 43:50.627
Is there a problem, sir?

43:50.712 --> 43:53.880
Yeah, I was asking
how paranoid you have to, you have to be...

43:54.924 --> 43:59.094
Sir?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.776
Captain, my name is Don Keefer.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.739
That's Elliot Hirsch and that's Sloan Sabbith.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.283
We work for Atlantis Cable News.

44:21.743 --> 44:26.413
And we wanted you and your first officer
and Flight Attendant Crazy Lady

44:26.497 --> 44:28.206
to be the first ones on this plane to know

44:28.291 --> 44:31.293
that our armed forces
killed Osama bin Laden for you tonight.

44:33.421 --> 44:34.838
You're serious?

44:35.506 --> 44:36.631
Yes, sir.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.818
We reported the news.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.372
Sorry, I thought it was a spider.

45:08.456 --> 45:09.790
Tapping you on the shoulder?

45:09.874 --> 45:11.875
- Not everything makes sense.
- Most things do.

45:12.794 --> 45:15.212
- But can I say something?
- You have to get the last word, too?

45:15.296 --> 45:16.838
- This never would have worked.
- I want to find out.

45:18.466 --> 45:21.510
Yes, this was a fix-up that I didn't want.

45:21.594 --> 45:26.056
And Maggie forced Valentine's Day on me.
And there was a certain amount of

45:26.140 --> 45:28.350
cowardly behavior disguised as politeness.

45:28.434 --> 45:31.603
But now I'd like to ask you out on a first date.

45:32.188 --> 45:34.147
A complete do-over.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.734
I like you and I'm asking you out on a date.

45:39.821 --> 45:41.988
Took your breath away, didn't I?

45:43.324 --> 45:44.825
Now I get to make a cool exit.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.494
Less cool because you said so.

45:49.163 --> 45:50.914
- McAvoy!
- You don't have to shout.

45:50.998 --> 45:53.834
You haven't heard me shout. Where is he?

45:54.419 --> 45:55.836
Lonny.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.504
Good evening, Officers.

45:57.922 --> 45:59.005
Uh-oh.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.758
There's no way they can know, right?

46:01.843 --> 46:03.009
No.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.219
Can we help you?

46:04.303 --> 46:06.138
Mr. McAvoy, you know this man?

46:06.222 --> 46:07.889
Of course, he's a very famous jockey.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.559
Sir, we'd appreciate your cooperation.

46:11.185 --> 46:15.313
He's my bodyguard and I ran out of the car
because we were stuck in traffic,

46:15.398 --> 46:19.359
and chances are he abandoned the car to try
to protect me 'cause he's good at his job.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.945
He's also a former MP in the US Army,

46:22.029 --> 46:23.864
so I want to tell him something.
Lonny, come here.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.262
- You should tell them.
- You should tell them.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.852
Officers,

46:55.229 --> 46:56.313
I have some news for you.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.504
This is Charlie Skinner.

47:20.588 --> 47:22.547
So, we've established trust?

47:22.632 --> 47:24.257
Is this Late for Dinner?

47:24.342 --> 47:26.259
Yeah.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.637
You work for the White House or DOD?

47:28.721 --> 47:30.013
Neither.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.225
You've been calling me on a cell phone.
There are about 19 different ways...

47:33.309 --> 47:35.060
The calls are encrypted.

47:35.144 --> 47:38.146
I know how to find out who I am,
but you don't.

47:38.231 --> 47:39.856
So you're with the NSA?

47:39.941 --> 47:44.194
I am. I'm with a unit that's been
monitoring illegal electronic surveillance.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.696
- By whom?
- By AWM.

47:46.781 --> 47:51.993
News of the World isn't the only tabloid
that figured out how to hack a phone.

47:52.078 --> 47:55.372
- If you're fucking around with me...
- I think by now you know I'm not.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.040
You've got a big night ahead of you.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.000
- We'll talk again.
- When?

47:59.085 --> 48:00.377
When I want to.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.755
AWM owns a tabloid magazine, TMI!

48:03.839 --> 48:05.215
Are you saying you have evidence

48:05.299 --> 48:07.884
that they've been
engaging in the same kind of...

48:07.969 --> 48:10.095
You're not there, are you?

48:12.640 --> 48:13.848
Charlie.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.059
Charlie?

48:16.143 --> 48:19.229
What if I told you that bin Laden
wasn't the only story we got tonight?

48:19.772 --> 48:20.814
What are you talking about?

48:24.277 --> 48:25.527
Don't worry about it.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.779
I think we should go.

48:28.990 --> 48:32.617
Jay Carney or someone's office would have
sent us an email saying reportable.

48:32.702 --> 48:35.161
They also would have called us
begging us not to report it.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.497
I'm unwilling to take that chance.

48:37.582 --> 48:39.082
When was the last time
you checked your emails?

48:39.166 --> 48:41.459
- 15 seconds ago.
- When was the last time you did?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.420
Hmm?

48:44.380 --> 48:45.672
Look at your BlackBerry.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.510
- Press the buttons!
- Sure.

48:54.932 --> 48:57.601
Okay, not tonight, but in days to come,

48:57.685 --> 49:00.520
you'll look back and think
that this moment was funny.

49:03.316 --> 49:05.734
- It's from 20 minutes ago.
-  Yeah.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.152
What's it say?

49:07.236 --> 49:09.404
"OBL reportable.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.906
"Knock 'em dead just like we did."

49:12.658 --> 49:13.950
Who's it from?

49:14.035 --> 49:15.452
Joe Biden.

49:15.536 --> 49:16.786
Are you kidding me?

49:16.871 --> 49:19.331
We used to play softball together
when he was in the Senate.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.082
He knows something about the landing leg.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.584
Get on the air!

49:23.711 --> 49:26.171
We're going!

49:30.801 --> 49:33.053
When did you turn into Ted Baxter?

49:33.137 --> 49:36.222
Oh, come on. Enjoy the moment.

49:36.432 --> 49:38.600
Herb, have Washington throw it
to us in 30 seconds.

49:38.684 --> 49:41.227
Copy that.
D.C. Control, you're gonna throw it here in 30.

49:48.694 --> 49:49.736
Good thinking.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.739
- Let's see the banner.
- Right here.

50:06.587 --> 50:08.546
In five.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.175
Do it for me, Will.

50:12.927 --> 50:13.968
Good evening.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.596
From New York City, I'm Will McAvoy.

50:16.681 --> 50:22.018
ACN is now able to report and confirm
that for the first time in almost three decades,

50:22.103 --> 50:25.647
the world has no reason
to fear Osama bin Laden.

50:25.731 --> 50:28.983
In just a moment,
in a live address to the nation,

50:29.068 --> 50:32.195
the President will announce
that in a coordinated operation

50:32.279 --> 50:33.613
under the cover of darkness,

50:33.823 --> 50:37.951
US Special Forces tonight
killed the leader of al-Qaeda

50:38.035 --> 50:43.039
and the mastermind behind the deadly attack
of September 11th, 2001.

50:43.124 --> 50:46.084
It's been nine years, seven months,
and 20 days

50:46.168 --> 50:49.045
since America's most wanted criminal
took from us

50:49.130 --> 50:52.966
2,977 American sons and daughters,

50:53.592 --> 50:57.303
fathers and mothers, friends and colleagues.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.223
We were transformed
that morning into a different nation,

51:00.307 --> 51:03.351
more fearful and so, of course, more hostile.

51:03.436 --> 51:06.062
And while nothing, not even this victory

51:06.147 --> 51:08.565
our country has waited for
for such a long time,

51:08.649 --> 51:11.693
can bring back the souls lost
on that terrible morning

51:11.777 --> 51:14.154
in New York City, in Virginia,

51:14.238 --> 51:16.239
in a field in Pennsylvania,

51:16.323 --> 51:18.742
and all across America and the world,

51:18.826 --> 51:21.411
let tonight serve as a welcome reminder

51:21.704 --> 51:23.663
that throughout our history,

51:23.748 --> 51:28.376
America's darkest days have always
been followed by its finest hours.

51:30.129 --> 51:33.214
Here now, from the East Room
of the White House,

51:33.299 --> 51:36.134
the President of the United States.

51:38.804 --> 51:39.804
Good evening.

51:40.973 --> 51:45.477
Tonight I can report
to the American people and to the world

51:45.561 --> 51:50.023
that the United States has conducted
an operation that killed Osama bin Laden,

51:50.107 --> 51:51.941
the leader of al-Qaeda

51:52.026 --> 51:54.402
and a terrorist who's responsible
for the murder

51:54.487 --> 51:58.782
of thousands of innocent men,
women and children.

51:59.950 --> 52:03.953
It was nearly 10 years ago
that a bright September day was darkened

52:04.038 --> 52:07.874
by the worst attack
on the American people in our history.

52:07.958 --> 52:12.378
The images of 9/11 are seared
into our national memory.

52:12.463 --> 52:17.342
Hijacked planes cutting through
a cloudless September sky.

52:17.426 --> 52:20.011
The Twin Towers collapsing to the ground.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.389
Black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon.

52:23.474 --> 52:28.102
The wreckage of Flight 93
in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,

52:28.187 --> 52:29.729
where the actions of heroic citizens

52:29.814 --> 52:33.191
saved even more heartbreak and destruction.

52:33.275 --> 52:38.154
And yet we know that the worst images
are those that were unseen to the world.

52:38.239 --> 52:40.740
The empty seat at the dinner table.

52:40.825 --> 52:44.244
Children who were forced to grow up
without their mother or their father...
