WEBVTT

00:04.009 --> 00:07.379
Come on, charlie.
Go tinkle-winkle.

00:07.379 --> 00:10.883
Make the poo-poo
for the mama.

00:10.883 --> 00:11.603
No no?

00:12.919 --> 00:14.253
All right,
I'll tell you what--

00:14.253 --> 00:16.322
Five bucks for a number one,
10 bucks for a number two.

00:16.322 --> 00:18.023
All right?

00:20.894 --> 00:23.329
Uh uh uh, excuse me,
what are you doing?

00:23.329 --> 00:25.698
Playing a video game.
That's how kids

00:25.698 --> 00:28.601
From our generation
entertain themselves.

00:28.601 --> 00:30.603
Charlie is watching
her favorite show.

00:30.603 --> 00:32.371
It's the only way we can
get her to sit on the potty.

00:32.371 --> 00:34.373
Charlie has to watch
"the gurgles"

00:34.373 --> 00:36.342
In order to do
her business?

00:36.342 --> 00:38.611
Yes, "the gurgles"
help charlie

00:38.611 --> 00:41.046
The same way that the sports
section helps your dad.

00:41.046 --> 00:43.449
Look at this garbage--

00:43.449 --> 00:45.951
Brightly colored
singing and dancing shapes.

00:45.951 --> 00:48.020
Would you guys
just go upstairs?

00:48.020 --> 00:50.923
If she isn't potty-trained by tomorrow,
she won't get into the good preschool.

00:50.923 --> 00:53.526
- Come on!
- But then we're gonna have to unhook the game system

00:53.526 --> 00:55.227
Down here
and rehook it up there.

00:56.363 --> 00:58.330
We already walked
all the way down here.

00:58.330 --> 01:01.801
Are we supposed to rewalk
all the way up there?

01:01.801 --> 01:04.870
You know, we wouldn't have this
problem if we had a tv in our room.

01:04.870 --> 01:08.574
Okay, for the millionth time, I
am not buying a tv for your room.

01:08.574 --> 01:11.110
Fine.
Let's go, p.J.

01:11.110 --> 01:13.045
Ooh, hold on.

01:13.045 --> 01:15.481
The circle and the square
are fighting over a grape.

01:15.481 --> 01:17.516
I want to see
how this turns out.

01:20.653 --> 01:22.087
<i>¶ today's all burnt toast ¶</i>

01:22.087 --> 01:23.789
<i>¶ running late,
and dad says ¶</i>

01:23.789 --> 01:26.425
<i>¶ has anybody
seen my left shoe? ¶</i>

01:26.425 --> 01:28.594
<i>¶ I close my eyes,
take a bite ¶</i>

01:28.594 --> 01:30.429
<i>¶ grab a ride,
laugh out loud ¶</i>

01:30.429 --> 01:32.965
<i>¶ there it is
up on the roof ¶</i>

01:32.965 --> 01:36.135
<i>¶ I've been there,
I've survived ¶</i>

01:36.135 --> 01:39.572
<i>¶ so just take
my advice ¶</i>

01:39.572 --> 01:41.707
<i>¶ hang in there, baby ¶</i>

01:41.707 --> 01:43.475
<i>¶ things are crazy ¶</i>

01:43.475 --> 01:46.412
<i>¶ but I know
your future's bright ¶</i>

01:46.412 --> 01:48.180
<i>¶ hang in there, baby ¶</i>

01:48.180 --> 01:49.849
<i>¶ there's no maybe ¶</i>

01:49.849 --> 01:52.751
<i>¶ everything
turns out all right ¶</i>

01:52.751 --> 01:55.087
<i>¶ your life
is up and down ¶</i>

01:55.087 --> 01:58.624
<i>¶ but trust me,
it comes back around ¶</i>

01:58.624 --> 02:02.728
<i>¶ you're gonna love
who you turn out to be ¶</i>

02:04.064 --> 02:06.765
<i>¶ hang in there, baby. ¶</i>

02:13.172 --> 02:14.573
Hey.

02:14.573 --> 02:15.533
Hey hey.

02:17.878 --> 02:19.912
Hey, mr. Duncan.

02:19.912 --> 02:21.981
Hey, ivy.
You spending the night?

02:21.981 --> 02:23.816
Yeah, our house
is being fumigated.

02:23.816 --> 02:24.566
Oh.

02:25.218 --> 02:27.753
I guess your parents
didn't know

02:27.753 --> 02:29.321
That my company
bob's bugs be gone

02:29.321 --> 02:30.789
Also does fumigations.

02:30.789 --> 02:33.158
No, they knew that.

02:33.158 --> 02:35.828
Oh, well, you know,

02:35.828 --> 02:37.830
It's too bad
they didn't call.

02:37.830 --> 02:40.332
I could have given them
a big discount.

02:40.332 --> 02:42.501
They knew that too.

02:43.837 --> 02:44.587
Oh.

02:46.373 --> 02:47.623
Okay.

02:49.743 --> 02:51.644
No biggie.

02:51.644 --> 02:53.245
What was that about?

02:53.245 --> 02:56.048
Who knows? It's your fault
for saying, "hey, mr. Duncan."

02:56.048 --> 02:59.151
So are you ready
for the big news?

02:59.151 --> 03:00.386
Always.

03:00.386 --> 03:02.421
Here goes.

03:03.423 --> 03:05.124
- There's a guy.
- There's a guy?

03:05.124 --> 03:06.592
- There's a guy.
- There's a guy?!

03:06.592 --> 03:07.860
There's a guy!

03:07.860 --> 03:09.695
- Super happy dance.
- Okay.

03:09.695 --> 03:11.764
¶ super super ¶

03:11.764 --> 03:13.432
¶ happy dance. ¶

03:13.432 --> 03:14.867
Happy!

03:17.470 --> 03:19.505
So who is he?

03:19.505 --> 03:22.274
He's that new guy in our
government class-- raymond.

03:22.274 --> 03:24.043
Oh, he's cute.

03:24.043 --> 03:25.945
Wait, so when did you
start talking to him?

03:25.945 --> 03:28.914
Well, we haven't
actually talked yet.

03:28.914 --> 03:31.317
We've been iming.
That led to texting.

03:31.317 --> 03:33.619
Tonight he wants to step it
all the way up to video chat.

03:33.619 --> 03:36.055
I don't know
if I'm ready.

03:36.055 --> 03:38.891
All right, let's get you all
cutied up for your video chat.

03:42.295 --> 03:44.863
Um, if the bugs
come back--

03:44.863 --> 03:47.499
<i>I mean, when
the bugs come back,</i>

03:47.499 --> 03:50.936
This is my card.

03:50.936 --> 03:54.139
You know what? I'm gonna get you
a coupon. You wait right there.

03:54.139 --> 03:56.709
Now's our chance.
Go go go go!

04:01.281 --> 04:03.082
All right, there we go.

04:03.082 --> 04:04.917
Brand new.
Brand new.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.251
Look.
Look at that.

04:06.251 --> 04:08.387
Now--
quack quack quack--

04:08.387 --> 04:10.389
When you're a big girl,

04:10.389 --> 04:12.391
This is where
you're gonna go potty.

04:12.391 --> 04:14.226
Now just make sure
the toilet seat is down

04:14.226 --> 04:15.627
So you don't
fall in.

04:15.627 --> 04:18.397
And hopefully you'll only
make that mistake once--

04:18.397 --> 04:20.399
Well, unless you're p.J.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.768
And then
it's many many times.

04:25.138 --> 04:26.305
You know,

04:26.305 --> 04:28.273
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

04:28.273 --> 04:30.409
Sometimes
I come up here

04:30.409 --> 04:32.044
I don't even
have to go.

04:33.580 --> 04:37.016
Sometimes daddy just needs
a little vacation.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:47.460 --> 04:48.180
Uh-oh.

04:55.969 --> 04:57.936
So what do you think?

04:57.936 --> 04:59.938
I don't know.

04:59.938 --> 05:01.940
Ivy, raymond will
love you.

05:01.940 --> 05:04.910
You look hot--
like, smoking hot.

05:04.910 --> 05:07.813
Okay, now I see it.

05:07.813 --> 05:11.417
Okay.  Now let's see
how you look onscreen.

05:11.417 --> 05:12.667
Uh...

05:13.753 --> 05:15.721
Pretty good.
Just tilt down a little.

05:15.721 --> 05:17.956
I'm getting
too much nostril.

05:17.956 --> 05:19.491
Better.
Better.

05:19.491 --> 05:22.161
<i>Now let's see
some shoulder.</i>

05:22.161 --> 05:24.163
Ah, perfect.

05:24.163 --> 05:25.731
Now flutter your eyes.

05:28.168 --> 05:30.903
Now don't do that.

05:30.903 --> 05:32.638
<i>Smile.</i>

05:32.638 --> 05:34.706
<i>Less teeth.
More teeth.</i>

05:34.706 --> 05:36.442
<i>Less teeth.</i>

05:36.442 --> 05:38.377
That's it.  That's it.
That's it.  Now don't move.

05:38.377 --> 05:40.379
Look right in the camera

05:40.379 --> 05:42.815
And tell raymond
what's on your mind.

05:44.284 --> 05:46.552
I think I'm stuck.

05:49.255 --> 05:52.391
Honey, I try never to ask you
this after you exit the bathroom,

05:52.391 --> 05:56.495
But what was that horrible
sound I heard a few minutes ago?

05:56.495 --> 05:59.731
Charlie just threw some things in
the toilet, clogged up the pipes.

05:59.731 --> 06:02.267
So I just gotta dig a
little hole in the backyard,

06:02.267 --> 06:05.871
Clean out the main line. Don't
worry. Everything is gonna be fine.

06:05.871 --> 06:07.706
Should I call
a plumber?

06:07.706 --> 06:10.142
Absolutely not.

06:11.377 --> 06:14.146
I have got this
all under control.

06:14.146 --> 06:15.380
Where's charlie?

06:19.285 --> 06:20.919
I'll be right back.

06:24.390 --> 06:28.494
As long as he looks scared,
I've done my job.

06:30.496 --> 06:35.067
Boys, would you turn down
that tv in your room?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.069
Tv in your room?

06:37.069 --> 06:39.338
Oh, mama don't think so.

06:47.614 --> 06:49.581
What is this?

06:49.581 --> 06:51.083
A free tv.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.019
- Ha ha!
- Isn't it awesome?

06:54.019 --> 06:55.721
It was just sitting
on someone's lawn.

06:55.721 --> 06:57.623
Yeah, there was a sign
that said "please take,"

06:57.623 --> 07:00.359
So we took.

07:00.359 --> 07:03.762
It's a little big
for the room, don't you think?

07:03.762 --> 07:05.764
Yeah, it was at first,
but then

07:05.764 --> 07:07.766
Gabe came up with
the brilliant idea

07:07.766 --> 07:09.301
Of bunk desks.

07:11.604 --> 07:13.805
Bunk desks.
Right right.

07:13.805 --> 07:15.707
Where's your dresser?

07:15.707 --> 07:18.877
- Under p.J.'s bed.
- Yeah, at first I was concerned

07:18.877 --> 07:22.047
That getting a fresh pair of underpants
every day was gonna be a little tricky.

07:22.047 --> 07:24.049
But then I came up
with a solution--

07:24.049 --> 07:26.418
The underpants pillow.

07:26.418 --> 07:28.720
- Bam!
- Buh-bam!

07:30.123 --> 07:32.357
Every time I come in here
I regret it.

07:50.843 --> 07:53.912
Oh!
Oh oh oh!

07:53.912 --> 07:56.148
Argh!  Argh!

08:02.255 --> 08:04.623
uh-oh.

08:11.364 --> 08:12.931
What happened?

08:12.931 --> 08:15.267
The power went out
and the plumbing.

08:15.267 --> 08:16.702
Well, how did
that happen?

08:16.702 --> 08:19.605
Let's ask the soaking
wet man with the pickaxe.

08:19.605 --> 08:21.707
Hey, everybody.

08:23.510 --> 08:26.045
Dad, when is the power
coming back on?

08:26.045 --> 08:28.347
Yeah, I'm 15 minutes away
from a video chat.

08:28.347 --> 08:31.583
And if we're gonna potty-train
charlie, she has to watch "the gurgles."

08:31.583 --> 08:34.253
Uh, first of all,
I'm fine.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.990
What?  No, didn't get
electrocuted.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.625
Thanks for the concern.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.193
What about the water?

08:41.193 --> 08:43.962
All right, I've already called
the plumber and the electrician...

08:43.962 --> 08:46.398
All: Oh, there
we go. Okay.

08:46.398 --> 08:48.467
...Who can't be here
until tomorrow...

08:48.467 --> 08:50.302
- What?  Bob!
- ...Ish.

08:51.937 --> 08:55.007
Come on.
Hey hey hey!

08:55.007 --> 08:58.277
We can survive one night
without water and power.

08:58.277 --> 09:00.846
Come on,
it's gonna be fine.

09:05.652 --> 09:08.120
I heard some kind of explosion
and rushed right over

09:08.120 --> 09:10.356
To see if gabe was
anywhere near the blast.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.093
I'm right here,
mrs. Dabney,

09:14.093 --> 09:15.227
Better than ever.

09:15.227 --> 09:17.996
Are you sure?
No internal injuries?

09:18.998 --> 09:21.533
My stomach is
kind of upset.

09:21.533 --> 09:24.269
Might be a touch
of dabnerrhea.

09:24.269 --> 09:26.538
All right.
Mrs. Dabney, you know,

09:26.538 --> 09:29.641
We're gonna be without
water and power for a while.

09:29.641 --> 09:31.777
It sure would be helpful if
we could use your bathroom

09:31.777 --> 09:33.145
Till ours is
up and running.

09:33.145 --> 09:36.248
I don't even let mr. Dabney
use my bathroom.

09:37.517 --> 09:39.885
Okay, mrs. Dabney,
I know it's an imposition,

09:39.885 --> 09:42.020
But the thing is
we have a really important

09:42.020 --> 09:44.022
Preschool interview
tomorrow morning

09:44.022 --> 09:46.592
And it sure would be nice
if we could use your bathroom

09:46.592 --> 09:48.160
To freshen up
beforehand.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.062
- Need to freshen up, huh?
- Yeah.

09:50.062 --> 09:52.831
I hear the bus station
has a real nice bathroom.

09:55.101 --> 09:57.336
Have a good night now.

10:00.974 --> 10:03.609
Gabriel duncan!
Dabnerrhea?

10:03.609 --> 10:04.859
Yeah.

10:06.045 --> 10:07.379
Up top.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
Bob.

10:15.655 --> 10:16.655
Hey.

10:18.925 --> 10:21.193
Remember when you said
we wouldn't need this?

10:21.193 --> 10:23.729
Who looks stupid now?

10:25.265 --> 10:28.333
Which question
should I answer first?

10:28.333 --> 10:31.637
Any progress
on the potty-training?

10:31.637 --> 10:34.673
Nope, without "the gurgles" charlie
won't even sit on that potty,

10:34.673 --> 10:36.375
And the interview
is in 12 hours.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.143
Oh, she'll get it.

10:38.143 --> 10:39.978
That's the thing
about us duncans--

10:39.978 --> 10:41.914
We're clutch players.

10:42.916 --> 10:44.750
I see the light's on.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.119
I'm not sure
anybody's home.

10:48.288 --> 10:50.088
Where are the kids?

10:50.088 --> 10:52.825
Charlie's taking a nap.
Teddy and ivy are downstairs

10:52.825 --> 10:54.793
And the boys are
in their room reading.

10:54.793 --> 10:56.161
P.J. And gabe
are reading?

10:56.161 --> 10:57.563
Yeah, it was
their idea.

10:57.563 --> 11:00.799
So they're reading--
voluntarily?

11:02.936 --> 11:04.136
Huh.

11:07.173 --> 11:09.107
Let's roll.

11:13.847 --> 11:14.980
Oh!

11:14.980 --> 11:17.716
Sorry, I should have
warned you about that.

11:17.716 --> 11:19.685
What is going on in here?

11:19.685 --> 11:22.488
Great news--
the power is back on.

11:22.488 --> 11:24.656
Well, it is for us.

11:24.656 --> 11:26.792
Where are you getting
your power from?

11:26.792 --> 11:30.128
Hey, are you stealing
electricity from mrs. Dabney?

11:30.128 --> 11:31.630
Are we in trouble?

11:35.668 --> 11:38.737
What's taking
those nachos so long?

11:38.737 --> 11:41.940
There really is a lot of stuff
plugged in. Are you sure this is safe?

11:41.940 --> 11:45.344
Ah, here's the problem.
We've got a loose connection.

11:45.344 --> 11:48.113
Everything's under control.

11:50.850 --> 11:54.219
P.J.:
Huh, that's weird.

11:54.219 --> 11:56.255
Mrs. Dabney's power
is out too.

11:56.255 --> 11:58.323
Oh look,
here she comes.

11:58.323 --> 12:01.360
You know, for an older gal,
she moves pretty fast.

12:09.736 --> 12:11.737
Nachos?

12:18.945 --> 12:20.913
Raymond will think
I blew him off.

12:20.913 --> 12:24.449
I probably lost him forever.
Now I'm gonna die sad and alone.

12:24.449 --> 12:27.286
Ivy, you're not gonna
die alone.

12:27.286 --> 12:30.055
You can live with me
and my husband

12:30.055 --> 12:32.658
In our pool house.

12:34.761 --> 12:37.963
No offense,
but that sounds awful.

12:38.998 --> 12:40.933
Well, not for me.

12:40.933 --> 12:43.569
I have a husband
and a pool house.

12:44.771 --> 12:46.305
You could just
call raymond.

12:46.305 --> 12:48.006
Mom, we can't do that.

12:48.006 --> 12:50.242
Our cell phones are dead
and we can't charge them.

12:50.242 --> 12:52.477
Use the wall phone.
It works without electricity.

12:52.477 --> 12:54.513
The wall what?

12:57.717 --> 12:59.985
The wall phone--

12:59.985 --> 13:02.387
You know, the phone

13:02.387 --> 13:05.857
On the wall.

13:05.857 --> 13:07.426
When did we get that?

13:07.426 --> 13:09.194
When we bought
the house.

13:10.730 --> 13:12.564
Just one problem--

13:12.564 --> 13:14.232
Raymond's number
is in my phone.

13:14.232 --> 13:15.934
Well, if you know
his last name,

13:15.934 --> 13:18.737
- Just look him up in the phonebook.
- The phone what?

13:20.340 --> 13:22.774
Okay, now you can see
what it was like

13:22.774 --> 13:24.776
To live life
in the olden days,

13:24.776 --> 13:26.612
Also known
as the '90s.

13:31.150 --> 13:34.252
Huh.  Here's
raymond's number.

13:34.252 --> 13:36.288
- What?
- Yeah.

13:37.957 --> 13:39.825
Okay.

13:41.961 --> 13:43.228
Oh, it's right there.

13:43.228 --> 13:44.529
Oh, right here?

13:51.270 --> 13:53.472
It's ringing.

13:53.472 --> 13:55.774
- I can't do this.
- Ivy.

13:55.774 --> 13:58.276
- I'm just not ready.
- Don't give it to me.

13:58.276 --> 14:00.278
What am I supposed to--?
Hello.

14:00.278 --> 14:03.815
Raymond, hi.
Hi, it's teddy.

14:03.815 --> 14:05.450
Ivy's best friend.

14:05.450 --> 14:08.086
Yeah, I'm sure you've
heard all about me.

14:09.355 --> 14:11.390
Oh really?

14:11.390 --> 14:14.259
Not a thing?

14:18.898 --> 14:20.599
Anyways,

14:20.599 --> 14:22.601
Sorry we missed
the video chat.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.603
There were some
technical difficulties,

14:24.603 --> 14:27.939
So I don't know if you and ivy
are gonna be able to talk tonight,

14:27.939 --> 14:30.175
Unless-- unless you want
to come over.

14:31.177 --> 14:32.778
Ivy loves the idea.

14:32.778 --> 14:35.347
Ivy's at 358 edgewood.
Okay, bye.

14:35.347 --> 14:37.282
He's on his way over.

14:37.282 --> 14:40.485
What are you doing, t?
I told you I wasn't ready.

14:40.485 --> 14:43.588
But you like him.
He likes you.

14:43.588 --> 14:45.924
Now get your booty
in gear, girl,

14:45.924 --> 14:48.694
'cause it's time
to represent.

14:51.130 --> 14:51.970
Huh-uh.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.902
Don't go street
on me, t.

14:56.902 --> 14:58.904
It's just sad.

15:04.177 --> 15:06.978
Ready for operation
potty train?

15:06.978 --> 15:09.381
- It's go time.
- We hope.

15:09.381 --> 15:11.616
Okay, p.J.,
let's hit it.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.985
Okay, hey, charlie, you
want to watch some tv?

15:13.985 --> 15:15.754
- Yeah.
- I bet your favorite show is on.

15:15.754 --> 15:17.355
I bet-- yeah.

15:17.355 --> 15:19.357
<i>Amy:
It's time to giggle</i>

15:19.357 --> 15:21.727
<i>With "the gurgles"!</i>

15:21.727 --> 15:23.729
<i>Bob:
Hi there, kids.</i>

15:23.729 --> 15:26.898
<i>Today is gonna be
a super-duper day.</i>

15:26.898 --> 15:28.467
<i>Why is that?</i>

15:28.467 --> 15:32.070
<i>Because we're gonna
do the potty rap.</i>

15:36.943 --> 15:39.644
¶ hey there, kids,
don't be naughty ¶

15:39.644 --> 15:42.147
¶ let's have fun
and use our potty ¶

15:44.584 --> 15:46.952
¶ going to the potty
can be so gnarly ¶

15:46.952 --> 15:49.588
¶ especially if you're
a girl named charlie. ¶

15:49.588 --> 15:51.590
Oh gosh, mommy.

16:03.986 --> 16:06.521
Well, that didn't work.

16:06.521 --> 16:08.523
Actually it worked for me.

16:08.523 --> 16:10.592
See ya.

16:18.034 --> 16:19.201
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:19.201 --> 16:21.470
- I'm raymond.
- Hi, I'm teddy.

16:21.470 --> 16:23.472
Come on in.

16:23.472 --> 16:25.607
Ivy, raymond's here.

16:25.607 --> 16:28.043
It's kind of dark
in here.

16:28.043 --> 16:30.045
Yeah, we're having
a power outage.

16:30.045 --> 16:32.380
Could I offer you
some chunky milk

16:32.380 --> 16:35.016
Or a glass
of ice cream?

16:35.016 --> 16:37.085
Uh, I'm cool.
Can I use the bathroom?

16:37.085 --> 16:38.186
No.

16:39.789 --> 16:41.490
The water's out too.

16:41.490 --> 16:43.658
Oh, nice place.

16:43.658 --> 16:46.261
I'm gonna see
what's keeping ivy.

16:46.261 --> 16:48.363
Just have a seat
right there.  Ivy!

16:50.600 --> 16:54.503
Enjoying myself so far.

16:54.503 --> 16:56.104
What's going on?

16:56.104 --> 16:58.206
What if I say something
stupid? Then he won't like me.

16:58.206 --> 17:00.809
Ivy, you say stupid stuff
to me all the time

17:00.809 --> 17:02.811
And I still like you.

17:02.811 --> 17:05.079
I'm serious, t.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.148
This is the first guy
I've ever really liked.

17:07.148 --> 17:09.050
I don't want
to mess it up.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.019
Come on,
you can do this.

17:11.019 --> 17:12.686
I can't.

17:12.686 --> 17:15.490
I just know if I look
into those big brown eyes

17:15.490 --> 17:17.192
I'm gonna freeze.

17:17.192 --> 17:19.560
So you don't want
to see his eyes.

17:20.762 --> 17:22.464
I can work with that.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.434
Ivy will be right out.

17:26.434 --> 17:29.871
Meanwhile, let's enjoy

17:29.871 --> 17:33.942
Some nice
battery-powered music...

17:33.942 --> 17:36.411
<i>- kicking it old school</i>

17:36.411 --> 17:39.414
Like they did
back in the diz-ay.

17:39.414 --> 17:41.683
Oh, teddy, right.

17:41.683 --> 17:43.652
Ivy did mention you.

17:46.656 --> 17:49.324
Okay, ivy, come on out.

17:52.361 --> 17:54.329
Teddy:
There she is.

17:54.329 --> 17:56.898
Now raymond is right
over there by the couch.

17:58.968 --> 18:01.002
Hey, how is it going?

18:01.002 --> 18:02.904
Good.

18:02.904 --> 18:04.739
Okay.

18:04.739 --> 18:06.775
Raymond, doesn't ivy
look nice?

18:06.775 --> 18:10.078
I can't see her.

18:10.078 --> 18:11.813
Take my word for it.

18:11.813 --> 18:13.848
Okay.

18:13.848 --> 18:15.517
Ivy, you look good...

18:15.517 --> 18:17.285
Probably.

18:17.285 --> 18:18.587
Thanks.

18:18.587 --> 18:20.956
There you go.
This is good.

18:20.956 --> 18:23.391
Okay, come on, guys.
You've got to keep it up.

18:23.391 --> 18:25.427
We were on a nice
roll there.

18:25.427 --> 18:27.395
All right?

18:27.395 --> 18:29.564
Still just me talking.

18:29.564 --> 18:31.399
Still just--

18:31.399 --> 18:33.168
Guys, what's going on
over there?

18:33.168 --> 18:35.670
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

18:35.670 --> 18:37.439
<i>Don't need
any light for that.</i>

18:37.439 --> 18:39.808
I'll just--
I'll be in the kitchen.

18:39.808 --> 18:42.010
Oh!
Argh, that's my shin.

18:42.010 --> 18:44.279
I'm okay. I'm totally
okay. Don't worry.

18:44.279 --> 18:45.029
Ow!

18:46.315 --> 18:48.350
Forehead too.

18:53.489 --> 18:55.624
Okay, sweetheart. Why
don't you go over there

18:55.624 --> 18:57.826
- And play with some toys, okay?
- Okay.

19:02.131 --> 19:03.898
What is that smell?

19:03.898 --> 19:05.900
That would be me,

19:05.900 --> 19:08.270
Because somebody said
we didn't have enough time

19:08.270 --> 19:10.338
To stop off at the bus
station to freshen up.

19:10.338 --> 19:13.208
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- My stink is your fault, yeah.

19:13.208 --> 19:15.644
That makes a lot of sense.
Tonight when we're done here

19:15.644 --> 19:17.846
I'm gonna drop you off at the
bus station. You can stay there

19:17.846 --> 19:20.749
- And freshen up all night long.
- All night long? Sounds good to me.

19:20.749 --> 19:23.985
- Hi.
- Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm sondra.

19:23.985 --> 19:26.221
Hi, I'm amy.
This is bob.

19:26.221 --> 19:28.523
And this is charlie.

19:28.523 --> 19:30.425
What--?

19:30.425 --> 19:33.728
Something wrong
with your face?

19:33.728 --> 19:37.699
No, there's some
kind of odor.

19:37.699 --> 19:39.634
Oh, that's my husband.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.703
Yeah, guilty as charged.

19:41.703 --> 19:45.073
We're having some plumbing issues at
our house and we weren't able to shower.

19:45.073 --> 19:47.142
Yeah, that explains
why I smell like a hobo.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.810
Not that there's
anything wrong with hobos.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.913
- No no no, some of my best friends are hobos.
- Yeah.

19:51.913 --> 19:54.416
Why don't we talk
about charlie?

19:54.416 --> 19:56.451
- Great idea.
- Okay.

19:58.721 --> 20:00.689
So how old is charlie?

20:00.689 --> 20:01.923
Already two.

20:01.923 --> 20:03.892
Is she still napping?

20:03.892 --> 20:05.527
Most days
in the afternoon, yes.

20:05.527 --> 20:07.228
Is she potty-trained?

20:07.228 --> 20:08.930
- Oh, of course.
- Absolutely.

20:08.930 --> 20:10.932
Yeah, potty train
has left the station.

20:10.932 --> 20:13.768
Absolutely.
Yes, sir.  Whoo-whoo!

20:17.772 --> 20:19.774
I'm sorry about that.

20:19.774 --> 20:21.876
Charlie sweetheart,
can you turn the tv off?

20:21.876 --> 20:24.279
That's okay. The little ones
sure love those "gurgles."

20:24.279 --> 20:26.281
- It's her favorite show.
- "gurgles."

20:28.550 --> 20:30.452
No-o-o!

20:37.827 --> 20:41.996
So the potty train
hasn't left the station.

20:43.466 --> 20:45.500
Whoo-whoo.

20:50.506 --> 20:52.841
Well, charlie, looks like

20:52.841 --> 20:54.843
Before you spend any time
in preschool

20:54.843 --> 20:57.412
You're gonna need to spend
a little more time

20:57.412 --> 21:00.315
In pee school.

21:04.120 --> 21:04.840
Sorry.

21:06.122 --> 21:08.356
It was either that
or new school-poo school,

21:08.356 --> 21:11.059
And I decided
to go classy, so...

21:11.059 --> 21:13.661
<i> Watch it, you idiot.</i>

21:13.661 --> 21:16.331
Speaking of classy, sounds
like your brothers are home.

21:16.331 --> 21:18.566
Gabe:
One, two, three.

21:18.566 --> 21:21.936
<i>What is that?</i>

21:21.936 --> 21:24.272
80-inch big screen.

21:24.272 --> 21:26.274
We found it in the alley.

21:26.274 --> 21:28.276
We're gonna put it
on top of the other one.

21:28.276 --> 21:30.345
We're gonna make
bunk tvs.

21:33.082 --> 21:35.450
They'll be out of the house
by the time you're my age.

21:35.450 --> 21:38.820
And if not,
then good luck, charlie.

21:42.716 --> 21:45.485
- House too small?
- Family too big?

21:45.485 --> 21:48.855
Then come on down to duncans'
double decker furniture warehouse.

21:48.855 --> 21:52.191
For all your stacked
furniture needs.

21:52.191 --> 21:55.228
Wouldn't it be great if your
couch could seat eight?

21:57.998 --> 22:00.500
Got a full bladder?
It doesn't matter.

22:03.537 --> 22:06.372
Remember that's duncans double
decker furniture warehouse.

22:06.372 --> 22:09.108
Stacking furniture since 2011.
