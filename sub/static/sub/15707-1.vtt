When I was younger

00:58.658 --> 01:00.743
I wanted to be a priest.

01:00.911 --> 01:02.536
I was going into battle

01:02.704 --> 01:05.331
to save men's souls
from the evil of the world.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.249
But as I got older,

01:07.417 --> 01:09.752
I saw the world
for what it really was.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.546
It wasn't so much
who I was going to save,

01:12.714 --> 01:15.091
but who was gonna save
the world from me.

I love you.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.308
I've got to go.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.268
Hey.

03:31.436 --> 03:32.770

03:32.938 --> 03:35.397

Hey, Sonny.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.069
How are you doing?

03:44.824 --> 03:47.117
Hey Dave,
can you quarterback for us?

03:47.285 --> 03:48.535
Can't, man.
I've got to go.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.624
Yo, man, you just moved
in here a week ago.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.834
How the fuck does everybody
know your name already?

03:56.002 --> 03:58.212
- Why you always riding him?
- It's a gift.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.631
I'm blessed with an outstandingly
magnetic personality.

04:00.799 --> 04:02.591
Big fucking mouth
you mean.

04:02.759 --> 04:05.552
Okay, Mr. Antisocial. Next time
you're standing next to some chick

04:05.720 --> 04:07.888
trying to get laid, you're
gonna need my big mouth.

04:08.056 --> 04:09.556
Yeah.

04:09.724 --> 04:12.226
The day I need you
to help me get laid--

04:12.394 --> 04:14.853
I see the way
your woman looks at me.

05:00.859 --> 05:02.735
Are you
eye-fucking me, boy?

05:04.362 --> 05:06.030
No, dog.

05:06.197 --> 05:09.283
My man in the warden's office says
they gonna be putting your ass

05:09.451 --> 05:12.828
back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.

05:12.996 --> 05:15.873
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.584
You's a real tough
motherfucker now, huh?

05:18.752 --> 05:21.378
That's why they got your ass
over there in C-block.

05:21.546 --> 05:24.214
That's where they keep all
the bitches and snitches.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.552
Which one you be?

05:35.643 --> 05:38.312
Hey!

05:38.480 --> 05:40.731
You got something
to say now, nigger?

05:40.899 --> 05:44.151
Who's a bitch now,
you motherfucker?

05:44.319 --> 05:46.111
You want to run
your mouth now, nigger?

05:46.279 --> 05:49.114
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.367
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.

05:51.534 --> 05:53.410
- Any fucking time.
- Shut up!

05:53.578 --> 05:55.496
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.

05:55.663 --> 05:57.623
Hey, general population,
I'll see you there.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.335
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle
or are you gonna drink it?

06:01.503 --> 06:03.003
What, you in a hurry, man?

06:03.171 --> 06:05.381
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.845
I was just remembering
the first time

06:12.013 --> 06:13.847
Dave ever met my pop.

06:14.015 --> 06:16.225
Dude, I thought he was
gonna shit himself.

06:16.393 --> 06:17.810
You remember that?
You were stuttering.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.437
You were like, ''N-n-n-nice
to meet you, s-sir.''

06:20.605 --> 06:22.189
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.

06:22.357 --> 06:24.817
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.902
Could be a mean old
son of a bitch.

06:27.070 --> 06:29.071
Nah, he was just all talk.

06:29.239 --> 06:31.907
All talk? That's all you've been
doing is talking.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.575
Start drinking.

06:38.415 --> 06:42.084
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.

06:42.252 --> 06:44.253
Hey, man, hey.

06:44.421 --> 06:47.256
You know why I love
being up here, man?

06:47.424 --> 06:50.175
It's just like
being above it all, man.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.512
Like no problems pressing
down on my shoulders.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.597
Hey, like if you need counseling,
I've got you covered.

06:55.765 --> 06:57.933
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.

07:01.146 --> 07:03.147
Man, fuck
the holidays, dude.

07:06.276 --> 07:08.694
Lighten up, man.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.905
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.

07:12.073 --> 07:14.867
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.369
Dude, get the fuck
off of me, man.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.705
I knew he wasn't going for that.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.125

What the fuck's
gotten into you, Vince?

09:45.602 --> 09:47.769
Killing that guy
wasn't part of the plan.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.063
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

09:50.231 --> 09:52.190
Nobody was
supposed to die, man.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.027
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.362
You think I want that guy
out there looking for us

09:57.530 --> 09:59.531
trying to put
a bullet in my head?

09:59.699 --> 10:02.326
Come on, man. The way I see it,
I was doing you a favor.

10:02.493 --> 10:05.537
A favor? Well, try not to do me
anymore fucking favors, all right?

10:05.705 --> 10:07.331
Ladies, ladies.

10:07.498 --> 10:09.541
Look, no kissing
on the first date, okay?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.293
Dude, what does that--

10:11.461 --> 10:14.588
Look, I just--
what's done is done, okay?

10:14.756 --> 10:18.133
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.

10:19.927 --> 10:21.637
Stupid.

10:28.478 --> 10:30.604
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.981
You tell him we'd be down
here by the old truck depot?

10:33.149 --> 10:34.650
Yeah, I told him.

10:34.817 --> 10:38.403
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.

10:42.325 --> 10:44.826
Come on now, we've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

10:44.994 --> 10:47.037
Let's not fucking fall apart.

10:48.373 --> 10:50.749
Yo, come check it out.

11:07.975 --> 11:10.519
- Five milly.
- Whoo!

11:10.687 --> 11:14.189
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.

11:14.357 --> 11:17.651
See, now you see why I did
what I did, man. I got y'alls back.

11:21.155 --> 11:22.406
Here he comes.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.038
Why don't y'all wait here?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.875
$5 million, man.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.295
I can take care of my girl.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.257
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.

11:40.425 --> 11:42.884
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.

11:43.052 --> 11:45.637
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.602
You sure?

11:52.770 --> 11:55.021
Like I got a choice.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.860
Oh!

12:00.027 --> 12:02.571
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.

12:06.909 --> 12:08.744
Let's go! Let's go!

12:15.251 --> 12:17.586
As I laid gasping
for my next breath,

12:17.754 --> 12:20.172
I knew God had given me
a second chance.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.758
But I was too stupid
to take it.

12:22.925 --> 12:24.760
I was going to get
what was mine.

12:26.471 --> 12:28.138
Sonny, what the fuck?

12:28.306 --> 12:29.347
- Fuck!
- He shot me.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.308
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.

12:32.602 --> 12:35.228
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.

12:36.606 --> 12:39.232
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.485
Lay down.
Lay down.

12:42.779 --> 12:44.112
Oh fuck.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.239
It's lodged
in your collarbone.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.537
Get your fucking dirty hands
out of there. Let me have a look.

12:52.705 --> 12:56.041
You got lucky. Looks like
it hit your cross. Let me get this off.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.503
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.

12:59.670 --> 13:02.005
Hold on, you're gonna
need this. Here.

13:02.173 --> 13:05.133
'Cause this is gonna
pucker your asshole.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.931
Move this.
Ready?

13:12.391 --> 13:15.060
Oh shit.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.978
It ain't even that deep.

13:17.146 --> 13:18.730
It's fucking burning, man.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.983
I heard something
was gonna go down.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.568
I didn't think
it was you guys.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.028
What did you hear, Joe?

13:25.196 --> 13:27.906
Come on, let me finish
this shit, all right?

13:28.074 --> 13:30.784
Ahh! Shit!

13:30.952 --> 13:32.452
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.705
I see the shit.
I feel it.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.960
Oh shit. Shit.

13:40.127 --> 13:41.670
Hold on, hold on.

13:41.838 --> 13:43.839
Oh fuck.

13:44.006 --> 13:47.801
Nice, huh? I'll make
a nice tongue stud with that.

13:53.057 --> 13:56.059
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?

13:56.227 --> 13:58.311
Vince was running his mouth

13:58.479 --> 14:01.147
to some connected guys downtown
that he's got a big score coming.

14:01.315 --> 14:03.316
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.

14:03.484 --> 14:06.319
I don't know. I think he was just
trying to buy some protection.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.783
Hold that there. Hold that.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.209
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.

14:21.377 --> 14:23.044
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?

14:23.212 --> 14:25.755
You gonna be walking around in
a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?

14:25.923 --> 14:28.049
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.

14:28.217 --> 14:30.218
Here.

14:32.221 --> 14:36.725
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.

14:36.893 --> 14:38.935
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet

14:39.103 --> 14:41.354
if someone was to go
down there this Friday night,

14:41.522 --> 14:45.609
he might run into Vince or someone
who knows where he is.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.946
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.

14:51.908 --> 14:53.825
Try not to get
your ass shot again, all right?

14:56.037 --> 14:57.579
You need anything,
you come back here.

14:57.747 --> 15:00.040
- All right?
- All right.

15:29.946 --> 15:32.614
Do you want to talk about it?

15:32.782 --> 15:34.950
Talk about what?

15:35.117 --> 15:37.118
Whatever brought you here.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.373
I'm here to pray for a friend.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.791
Ah.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.834
Is he sick?

15:45.002 --> 15:47.921
No. He's dead.

15:49.590 --> 15:51.466
Forgive me for asking.

15:51.634 --> 15:53.885
Were you close?

15:54.053 --> 15:55.804
Yeah.

15:55.972 --> 15:57.973
We were like brothers.

15:58.140 --> 16:02.519
Then rest assured
he is in a better place now.

16:03.771 --> 16:07.065
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?

16:11.821 --> 16:14.906
There are many paths
to God, my son.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.535
I pray that yours
will not be too difficult.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.510
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

16:49.025 --> 16:51.192
Hey, beautiful lines.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.111
Yeah.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.573
I guess $5 million will buy you
a lot of things like that, huh?

16:58.743 --> 17:01.953
You see, my friend, I think we are
both looking for the same thing.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.622
I'm not your friend
and I'm not looking for anything.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.835
Okay, so let's cut
the bullshit, shall we?

17:09.002 --> 17:12.714
You took something from us
and we want it back.

17:12.882 --> 17:16.300
And I'm the guy
they picked to get it back.

17:16.469 --> 17:20.763
However, if you help us,

17:20.931 --> 17:23.599
we are willing to overlook
your part in it.

17:23.768 --> 17:26.895
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:27.063 --> 17:30.398
Hey, come on. It only took me
two days to find you.

17:30.566 --> 17:33.777
And if I get those stones
without your help,

17:33.944 --> 17:36.863
we are going to meet again.

17:37.031 --> 17:41.242
Except this time you won't
even hear the hammer drop.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.953
Are we clear?

17:44.121 --> 17:46.539
Look, if it was up to my friends

17:46.707 --> 17:48.291
you'd be dead already.

17:48.459 --> 17:51.920
But I'm a patient man.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.925
You've got one week, huh?

17:57.093 --> 17:59.969
It was very nice meeting you.

18:02.765 --> 18:04.974
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?

18:05.142 --> 18:07.393
What you guys up to tonight?

18:07.561 --> 18:10.605
Oh come on,
don't be like that.

18:10.773 --> 18:12.649
Could you get that door
for me, big man?

18:12.817 --> 18:14.442
Sure, no problem.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.698
Why don't you stop playing
like such a fucking nit?

18:20.866 --> 18:23.993
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.

18:24.161 --> 18:25.787
In fact, take that.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.290
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.794
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

18:32.962 --> 18:34.963
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

18:36.674 --> 18:38.299
All right, now let's start over.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.052
Okay, what can we do for you?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.638
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.

18:43.806 --> 18:45.682
- Anybody seen him?
- No.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.225
Of course
everyone's got amnesia.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.018
But if you get
your memory back,

18:49.186 --> 18:51.396
tell him an old friend is
looking for him, all right?

18:54.525 --> 18:56.442
And now I'm robbing you.

18:56.610 --> 18:58.862
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

19:16.463 --> 19:18.423
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.383
Okay? Good.

19:20.551 --> 19:23.178
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

19:23.345 --> 19:26.097
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.

19:31.145 --> 19:34.564
Here you go.

19:34.732 --> 19:36.983
Slow night tonight, huh?

19:37.151 --> 19:39.694
Yeah well, it pays the bills.

19:39.862 --> 19:42.655
I'm really a singer. I'm not
gonna be here much longer.

19:42.823 --> 19:44.699
And why is that?

19:44.867 --> 19:46.576
Well, I pray every night

19:46.744 --> 19:48.453
that God gets me
a record contract.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.039
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.917
I just have to wait my turn.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.837
No no, that's for you.

19:58.005 --> 20:00.882
Thank you.

20:01.050 --> 20:02.884
Good things are coming
to you too.

20:03.052 --> 20:04.594
I promise.

20:04.762 --> 20:06.471
Happy holidays.

20:23.072 --> 20:24.364
You with me?

20:24.531 --> 20:27.742
- You got a name?
- Sonny.

20:27.910 --> 20:30.578
Like in ''O what a sunny
fucking day we're having?''

20:30.746 --> 20:32.330
Fuck you.
Who are you?

20:32.498 --> 20:34.832
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.

20:41.215 --> 20:43.675
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

20:43.842 --> 20:46.052
Are you?

20:47.888 --> 20:50.431
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.

20:50.599 --> 20:53.768
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?

20:57.273 --> 20:59.899
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?

21:00.067 --> 21:02.694
You think you're gonna
come into my town

21:02.861 --> 21:05.196
and take down poker games,

21:05.364 --> 21:07.824
shoot whoever you want
without my permission?

21:07.992 --> 21:10.159
Are you done
with your speech?

21:13.330 --> 21:15.331
Take it easy, Petey.

21:19.795 --> 21:22.130
What's the name
of the kid that shot you?

21:22.298 --> 21:25.883
Vincent. Vincent Long.

21:27.886 --> 21:30.138
Vincent Long that runs
with John R's crew?

21:30.306 --> 21:32.140
Yeah, he's been hanging around.

21:33.434 --> 21:35.018
Congratulations.

21:35.185 --> 21:37.687
You managed to piss off
a very important group of people

21:37.855 --> 21:40.773
that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.

21:40.941 --> 21:43.526
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

21:43.694 --> 21:46.112
Every fucking thing
I say is right.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.159
But I'm a fair guy.

21:51.327 --> 21:53.411
You help me out with my problem

21:53.579 --> 21:55.413
and I can help you out
with your problem.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.290
I'm listening.

21:57.458 --> 22:01.252
I used to know a guy,
laundered money for the Russians.

22:03.339 --> 22:06.382
But he had a funny way
of counting.

22:06.550 --> 22:09.552
For every $3 he laundered
he kept $1 for himself.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.972
Accumulated quite
a stack of dollars.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.099
$2 million.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.727
Only problem is the Russians
found out about it

22:17.895 --> 22:20.271
and chopped both his legs
off with a axe.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.440
But they never found the money.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.650
His family buried it with him.

22:24.818 --> 22:27.528
Well, I ain't digging up
no motherfucking dead body.

22:27.696 --> 22:30.448
Shut the fuck up.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.201
I don't want you to dig
anyone up.

22:35.037 --> 22:36.662
The Russians found out
where the money is.

22:36.830 --> 22:39.082
They're gonna take it
out of the ground tonight

22:39.249 --> 22:40.792
and you're gonna take it
from them.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.126
What's in it for me?

22:42.294 --> 22:46.255
Very few men know the exact
value of their life.

22:46.423 --> 22:48.591
Now you know
what yours is worth.

22:48.759 --> 22:50.885
$2 million.

22:51.053 --> 22:53.471
And just to make sure
you bring that money to me,

22:53.639 --> 22:55.515
I'm gonna send Petey
along with you.

22:58.936 --> 23:00.853
Get out of here.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.237
Okay, there they are.

23:14.535 --> 23:16.786
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.

23:19.706 --> 23:21.791
Hey, you got a plan?

23:21.959 --> 23:24.544
A plan? Oh yeah,
the plan's real complicated.

23:24.711 --> 23:26.421
You're gonna sneak
your ass down there

23:26.588 --> 23:29.006
and shoot those motherfuckers
in the head and grab the money.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.551
Then you're gonna run your ass
back up here like a crack nigger

23:31.718 --> 23:33.803
at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?

23:33.971 --> 23:35.263
And where you gonna be at?

23:35.431 --> 23:37.849
Oh, close enough to shoot you
in the head if you fuck up.

23:38.016 --> 23:40.435
What's to stop you from shooting me
after I bring you the money?

23:40.602 --> 23:43.438
That's what we call
a calculated risk.

23:43.605 --> 23:45.481
Ssst.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.901
All right, they got it.

23:49.069 --> 23:51.529
- Let's go. Go get it.
- Shit.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.518
Get down.

24:50.172 --> 24:52.006
Got it.

24:54.343 --> 24:56.552
I get your $2 million
and you're still gonna shoot me?

24:56.720 --> 24:58.471
No.

24:58.639 --> 25:02.183
But I can't watch you
and drive this car at the same time.

25:02.351 --> 25:03.559
I need that other gun.

25:08.524 --> 25:10.399
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.693
You've got some balls.

25:12.861 --> 25:16.405
You don't have to worry
about your problem now.

25:16.573 --> 25:18.366
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.

25:18.534 --> 25:20.535
I know you two got off
on the wrong foot.

25:20.702 --> 25:24.413
Hey, you did the job,
we've got his cash.

25:24.581 --> 25:26.332
Shit, let's celebrate.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.167
Know anyplace
where we can get a bag?

25:28.335 --> 25:31.963
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.

25:33.006 --> 25:35.007
Make it happen.

25:43.725 --> 25:45.851
Hey, what's up? It's Sonny.

25:46.019 --> 25:48.062
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.

25:48.230 --> 25:51.566
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.

25:53.026 --> 25:55.695
All right. All right, cool.

26:11.962 --> 26:14.130
You're just gonna leave
the money in the trunk?

26:14.298 --> 26:15.756
Yeah, why not?

26:15.924 --> 26:18.134
Who the fuck's gonna know
I got $2 million in my car?

26:41.074 --> 26:42.533
About time
you showed up, man.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.201
Come on, man.

26:44.369 --> 26:45.578
Who this?

26:45.746 --> 26:47.622
G, Petey; Petey, G.

26:47.789 --> 26:49.206
Is he a cop?

26:49.374 --> 26:51.584
Come on, why you gonna
ask me some shit like that?

26:51.752 --> 26:53.461
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.

26:53.629 --> 26:55.796
Y'all come on in.

26:58.592 --> 27:00.384
Damn.

27:04.222 --> 27:06.265
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?

27:06.433 --> 27:08.559
Depends on which war
you're talking about.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.853
How much you need?

27:19.112 --> 27:21.864
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.621
So how you been, Sonny?

27:28.789 --> 27:31.499
Hey, surviving.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.668
What's up
with this motherfucker, man?

27:33.835 --> 27:37.463
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.

27:46.223 --> 27:48.015
I can smell that weed
from over here, man.

27:48.183 --> 27:49.725
Ooh, this is that fire.

27:49.893 --> 27:51.852
Now we call this
that snakeweed.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.563
Got a partner, man,
he runs an exotic pet store--

27:57.150 --> 27:58.943
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.528
This ain't goddamn
''Duck Hunt.''

28:00.696 --> 28:02.947
Relax. I can handle
a fucking gun.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.532
I'm quite sure
you can handle a gun.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.826
But I just spent $2,000
getting them triggers dialed up.

28:09.705 --> 28:11.205
He's your boy, huh?

28:22.384 --> 28:26.762
Anyway, man, he puts the weed
inside of boa constrictors.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.515
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough

28:29.683 --> 28:31.308
to put their hand down
no goddamn snake's throat.

28:31.476 --> 28:34.228
They're too cheap for the X-rays.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.564
So they just wave them
motherfuckers on through.

28:36.732 --> 28:38.858
Holy shit!

28:39.025 --> 28:41.736
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.

28:41.903 --> 28:43.404
- Get a towel.
- What?

28:43.572 --> 28:44.739
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?

28:44.906 --> 28:46.323
This motherfucker's dead.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.118
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage

28:49.286 --> 28:51.620
without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?

28:51.788 --> 28:53.998
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.751
But he wanted to be the goddamn
Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.

28:56.918 --> 28:58.085
I am not going down
for this shit.

28:58.253 --> 28:59.420
Get me something
to wrap him up in.

28:59.588 --> 29:01.338
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.133
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?

29:04.301 --> 29:05.593
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?

29:05.761 --> 29:07.219
Motherfucker, you got
something better to do?

29:07.387 --> 29:09.096
No no no. You're right.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.933
- Shit.
- Okay.

29:13.101 --> 29:15.269
Okay. Man, you ought
to ashamed of yourself

29:15.437 --> 29:17.521
bringing this crazy white man
to my motherfucking house.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.316
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.

29:20.484 --> 29:22.234
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.

29:22.402 --> 29:24.278
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.

29:24.446 --> 29:26.113
I ain't fucking with you
no more, Sonny.

29:26.281 --> 29:29.658
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.

29:32.621 --> 29:34.246
- Oh.
- Oh shit.

29:34.414 --> 29:35.956
Damn.

29:36.124 --> 29:38.501
All right, all right.
Hold on. All right.

29:41.129 --> 29:43.380
What the hell were you
feeding this man?

29:49.471 --> 29:51.055
Right, where are the keys?

29:51.223 --> 29:52.723
He's got the keys.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.142
He got the keys?

29:56.728 --> 29:58.437
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.

30:06.279 --> 30:07.988
Getting my gun.

30:09.324 --> 30:11.742
Don't shoot your dick off,
motherfucker.

30:23.505 --> 30:25.881
Okay.

30:31.847 --> 30:34.640
You know I got
some nosy-ass neighbors.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.187
All right.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.149
Hey, Sonny man.

30:44.317 --> 30:46.193
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?

30:46.361 --> 30:49.864
Love you, man. But don't come
around here no more, all right?

30:50.031 --> 30:52.324
Bad for business, man.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.973
Hey, you're early.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.725
The suits are still here.

31:17.893 --> 31:19.768
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.

31:19.936 --> 31:22.271
All right?

31:22.439 --> 31:25.524
Grab his legs.

31:25.692 --> 31:27.818
Help me get him undressed.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.612
He's a big boy, isn't he?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.826
What are we gonna
do with his clothes?

31:35.994 --> 31:37.703
Oh, there's a furnace
in the back.

31:50.926 --> 31:52.760
Hmm.

31:52.928 --> 31:55.137
All right.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.600
All right.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.421
Yeah, bring the bin
a bit closer.

32:32.968 --> 32:34.802
There we go.

32:40.141 --> 32:43.060
Right.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.771
Did you know there's 207 bones
in the human body?

32:45.939 --> 32:49.400
And 27 of those are in the cranium.

32:49.567 --> 32:52.611
Now the average cranial capacity

32:52.779 --> 32:55.030
of modern man-- hit it, would you?

32:55.198 --> 32:57.491
--is 1200cc.

32:57.659 --> 33:00.494
And the average cranial capacity

33:00.662 --> 33:02.121
of Neanderthal man

33:02.288 --> 33:04.289
is 1800cc.

33:04.457 --> 33:06.667
I was just thinking
how fascinating

33:06.835 --> 33:09.878
that a creature that we think
is a primitive caveman

33:10.046 --> 33:13.257
actually had 27% more brains

33:13.425 --> 33:16.010
than anyone alive today.

33:16.177 --> 33:18.679
As I listened
to the butcher rambling on

33:18.847 --> 33:21.515
it hit me--
Vince set up the score.

33:21.683 --> 33:23.559
So the driver must have
been in on it.

33:23.727 --> 33:26.854
If I found her,
I'd be that much closer to him.

33:27.022 --> 33:28.897
As for Petey, well...

33:29.065 --> 33:32.609
let's just say there's a reason
I'll never eat a hamburger again.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.014
Drive around the block.

34:46.935 --> 34:50.687
Okay. Okay.
Okay, please.

34:53.315 --> 34:55.692
Please take it easy.

34:57.445 --> 34:59.238
This is far enough.
Pull over.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.616
Please don't hurt me.

35:02.784 --> 35:05.119
Shut it off.

35:06.621 --> 35:08.705
- Okay.
- What's your name?

35:08.873 --> 35:11.542
Mia.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.585
You recognize me?

35:15.421 --> 35:18.382
No, I'm sorry.
I don't. Should I?

35:18.550 --> 35:21.718
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked
on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.

35:25.932 --> 35:27.307
Yeah, that's right.

35:27.475 --> 35:29.101
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?

35:29.269 --> 35:32.980
The blonde guy? I swear
I have not seen him since then.

35:33.148 --> 35:35.274
I-- I met him
through some friends.

35:35.441 --> 35:38.652
He offered me $5,000
to take this guy to a spot.

35:38.820 --> 35:40.320
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.

35:40.488 --> 35:42.030
I swear to God.

35:42.198 --> 35:44.658
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

35:44.826 --> 35:47.286
I did not know that my client
was gonna get hurt.

35:47.453 --> 35:50.205
He promised me that
that wasn't going to happen.

35:50.373 --> 35:53.500
I swear to God I'm telling you
the truth. You have to believe me.

35:53.668 --> 35:55.836
Please, believe me.

35:56.004 --> 35:58.255
- Mia.
- Yes?

35:58.423 --> 36:01.550
For your sake I hope
you're telling the truth.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.809
Oh God.

37:30.139 --> 37:32.349
Gotcha.

38:33.328 --> 38:35.120
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa.

38:35.288 --> 38:37.331
There's no money
in the house.

38:37.498 --> 38:38.832
Vincent Long, you know him?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.668
No, I've never heard of him.

38:44.630 --> 38:46.715
Okay, yeah, I know him.

38:46.883 --> 38:49.217
Sit your ass down.

38:55.558 --> 38:57.017
Let's start with who you are.

38:57.185 --> 38:59.478
I'm Russell.

38:59.645 --> 39:02.814
I work for
the diamond exchange.

39:02.982 --> 39:06.526
Your friend came to me, asked me if
I could move $5 million in uncut stones.

39:06.694 --> 39:08.445
He brought 'em, I paid him.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.405
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.

39:10.573 --> 39:11.907
Not everybody.

39:12.075 --> 39:14.409
Well, obviously.

39:14.577 --> 39:17.162
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?

39:17.330 --> 39:18.872
She's my girlfriend.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.249
We needed a driver
who wouldn't freak out.

39:21.417 --> 39:23.960
So we planted her
at the car service.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.631
Look, I can't help you.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.842
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.

39:31.010 --> 39:33.011
People don't get their share,
some guy gets clipped,

39:33.179 --> 39:35.097
it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!

39:35.264 --> 39:37.349
- Dave Hall.
- What?

39:37.517 --> 39:40.852
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.771
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall! Dave Hall.

39:42.939 --> 39:44.648
That wasn't just
anybody who got clipped.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.317
That was my long-time
friend Dave Hall.

39:48.945 --> 39:51.655
Hey hey, I can help you
get Vince.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.199
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.

39:54.367 --> 39:57.244
He's got a place
he hangs out over on 3rd.

39:57.412 --> 40:00.956
Couple of guys, tough--
real stone killers.

40:03.418 --> 40:05.544
Now when you see him
you to give him a message.

40:05.711 --> 40:08.505
Tell him his old friend from high school
is looking for him.

40:16.889 --> 40:19.307
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?

40:19.475 --> 40:21.435
Really?

40:21.602 --> 40:24.020
- Put your arms down. Come around here.
- Unbelievable.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.273
So what are you gonna
do about this guy?

40:27.984 --> 40:31.403
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.

40:31.571 --> 40:34.406
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello.

40:34.574 --> 40:36.950
Now what the fuck are you
gonna do about this guy?

40:37.118 --> 40:39.494
He came to my house
last night, Vince.

40:39.662 --> 40:41.246
My house.

40:41.414 --> 40:44.124
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.

40:44.292 --> 40:45.959
- My end?
- Yes.

40:46.127 --> 40:48.837
Now take care of it.

40:49.005 --> 40:50.755
What did you tell him?

40:50.923 --> 40:51.965
What do you mean?

40:52.133 --> 40:54.968
I mean what
did you tell him?

40:55.136 --> 40:57.554
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?

40:57.722 --> 41:00.307
Russell, I know how weak you are,
so just tell me what you told him.

41:00.475 --> 41:02.350
I didn't-- I didn't say--
I didn't say anything.

41:02.518 --> 41:05.145
You're still alive.

41:05.313 --> 41:07.147
That means you
told him something.

41:07.315 --> 41:09.483
Now I want to know
what the fuck it was.

41:09.650 --> 41:12.027
Okay, you know what?
Yes.

41:12.195 --> 41:15.238
I told you
from the beginning

41:15.406 --> 41:17.616
there could be
no loose ends, Vince.

41:17.783 --> 41:20.035
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.

41:20.203 --> 41:22.329
Somewhere along the line
you fucked up.

41:22.497 --> 41:25.665
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.

41:36.969 --> 41:39.095
Get that shit
out of here, Markus.

41:43.976 --> 41:46.853
I-I can't believe
we're related.

41:47.021 --> 41:50.690
I fucked this guy for months
to make this deal happen.

41:50.858 --> 41:53.652
I never did like
the idea of you fucking him.

41:53.819 --> 41:56.655
You know what
we had to do, Vince.

41:56.822 --> 41:58.281
Now what about Sonny?

41:58.449 --> 42:00.742
I'm gonna handle it.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.412
How did he look?

42:04.580 --> 42:07.374
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.

42:07.542 --> 42:10.043
I hope you know
what you're doing, Vince.

42:19.887 --> 42:22.305
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?

42:29.063 --> 42:31.273
You know, one of the greatest
pleasures of my life

42:31.440 --> 42:35.151
is eating my breakfast
and reading the sports page.

42:36.571 --> 42:38.238
I like reading the box scores.

42:38.406 --> 42:40.574
I like seeing who wins,
who loses.

42:40.741 --> 42:44.077
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?

42:50.251 --> 42:52.335
Now they say

42:52.503 --> 42:55.005
that they're gonna stop
publishing newspapers

42:55.172 --> 42:57.382
so people can read the stats
and the box scores

42:57.550 --> 42:59.384
on their fucking cell phone.

42:59.552 --> 43:02.095
Who wants to look at a cell phone
when you're eating food?

43:02.263 --> 43:05.098
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is--

43:05.266 --> 43:07.767
uncivilized.

43:07.935 --> 43:10.270
It's a different world.

43:10.438 --> 43:12.397
Same world,

43:12.565 --> 43:14.441
different toys.

43:17.403 --> 43:19.195
What do you hear
about Petey and the kid?

43:19.363 --> 43:21.197
Nothing yet.

43:21.365 --> 43:23.491
But we grabbed one
of the Russians this morning.

43:23.659 --> 43:25.869
Sal's softening him up
right now.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.455
All right.
Go take a look.

43:28.623 --> 43:31.291
I'll be down there
in a little bit, all right?

43:31.459 --> 43:33.460
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.

43:33.628 --> 43:35.879
Will do, boss.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.978
Boss.

43:54.148 --> 43:55.857
What did Petey's mom say?

43:56.025 --> 43:58.193
She hasn't heard anything.

43:58.361 --> 44:00.862
And the sisters,
no one's seen him.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.824
This way.

44:06.327 --> 44:08.328
Thanks.

44:13.876 --> 44:17.504
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?

44:17.672 --> 44:21.966
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.

44:22.134 --> 44:24.678
Oh. Hey, buddy.

44:27.515 --> 44:29.474
Hey. Hey.

44:30.851 --> 44:34.187
How you doing in there?

44:34.355 --> 44:37.899
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking
purpose of interrogating him.

44:38.067 --> 44:40.485
How are you gonna get anything
out of him if he's dead?

44:40.653 --> 44:43.446
You brought me all the way
down here for this?

44:43.614 --> 44:45.448
Now you've got to go get
another Russian, all right?

45:06.929 --> 45:09.139
I was hoping I'd see
you again, my son.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.474
You can leave
the burden of life

45:11.642 --> 45:13.226
at the door
of God's house.

45:13.394 --> 45:16.730
You really believe
all this shit, Father?

45:18.441 --> 45:21.151
I mean, if He made good
He also made bad, right?

45:24.447 --> 45:26.531
Do you believe in free will?

45:26.699 --> 45:28.450
The idea that you are free

45:28.617 --> 45:30.785
to make your own choice
in this world.

45:30.953 --> 45:32.370
Of course.

45:32.538 --> 45:35.165
Then how could you make a choice
between right and wrong

45:35.332 --> 45:37.917
if God did not offer
the two extremes?

45:38.085 --> 45:41.588
The path to God is based
upon your ability

45:41.756 --> 45:44.466
as a thinking, feeling being

45:44.633 --> 45:46.509
to make the correct
decisions.

45:46.677 --> 45:49.763
If everything was perfect,
then you wouldn't be on earth.

45:49.930 --> 45:52.932
You'd already be in heaven.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.059
You don't live
in my world, Father.

45:55.227 --> 45:58.772
God can forgive
almost anything, my son.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.942
But you must open
your heart to Him.

46:41.649 --> 46:43.066
Aw, Christ.

46:43.234 --> 46:45.693
Back five fucking minutes,
I got to deal with this asshole.

46:45.861 --> 46:47.320
Hey, Johnny.

46:47.488 --> 46:50.657
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?

46:50.825 --> 46:52.158
- Hot.
- Yeah?

46:52.326 --> 46:53.910
Yeah, what else
you want to know?

46:54.078 --> 46:57.413
- I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.

46:57.581 --> 46:59.165
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.

46:59.333 --> 47:00.708
People that should
be dead, but ain't.

47:00.876 --> 47:03.169
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone,

47:03.337 --> 47:05.463
you put two in the head. That way
they can't come back for you.

47:05.631 --> 47:07.340
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that,

47:07.508 --> 47:09.592
did you?
Now you got problems.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.761
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

47:11.929 --> 47:13.972
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.

47:14.139 --> 47:15.890
Come on, man, you got a cut.

47:16.058 --> 47:18.935
For protection. I ain't going
to war for you, kid.

47:19.103 --> 47:21.855
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.

47:22.022 --> 47:26.109
Listen, that friend of yours,
somehow he got Biggs involved.

47:26.277 --> 47:27.902
That changed everything.

47:28.070 --> 47:30.947
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless,

47:31.115 --> 47:34.200
cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened

47:34.368 --> 47:36.619
- to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.

47:36.787 --> 47:38.913
Let's just say he got
a closed-casket funeral.

47:39.081 --> 47:42.333
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.

47:42.501 --> 47:44.836
All right.

47:45.004 --> 47:47.046
And I'll tell you something else.

47:47.214 --> 47:50.884
If Biggs reaches out for me,
I'm gonna deliver you.

47:51.051 --> 47:53.469
Just like that?

47:53.637 --> 47:55.972
It's business.

48:02.563 --> 48:04.647
John.

48:05.900 --> 48:08.067
Fuck.

49:12.174 --> 49:14.968
Sonny?

49:20.683 --> 49:22.892
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

49:42.079 --> 49:44.497
He always said that

49:44.665 --> 49:47.417
he'd be okay as long
as you were there.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.675
I'll make it better.

50:28.042 --> 50:29.500
Long time.

50:30.753 --> 50:32.170
Only 13 years.

50:32.337 --> 50:34.047
I can't help you.

50:34.214 --> 50:36.049
I didn't come here
to ask you for your help.

50:36.216 --> 50:37.717
Well, then why
don't you get to it?

50:37.885 --> 50:40.178
They only let me out of
my cage for about 15 minutes.

50:40.345 --> 50:43.598
I came to ask

50:43.766 --> 50:46.142
is there anything you
want me to tell your son

50:46.310 --> 50:48.811
before I kill him?

50:51.857 --> 50:54.400
You know, if this glass wasn't
between us I'd break your fucking neck

50:54.568 --> 50:56.277
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.

50:56.445 --> 50:57.862
Hey. Hey!

50:58.030 --> 50:59.655
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?

50:59.823 --> 51:02.366
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.

51:02.534 --> 51:04.494
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.

51:04.661 --> 51:06.913
All right, all right.

51:11.543 --> 51:13.878
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--

51:14.046 --> 51:16.089
What the fuck? Mia.

51:17.424 --> 51:19.092
So you gonna be around
later on?

51:21.845 --> 51:23.513
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.515
- Hey.
- What?

51:25.682 --> 51:27.809
Get your shit
and get going.

51:29.520 --> 51:32.563
I guess just go.

51:32.731 --> 51:34.607
You're a fucking asshole.

51:36.276 --> 51:38.945
This is why we're in a world
of shit, Vincent.

51:39.113 --> 51:40.780
Because you're off
fucking around

51:40.948 --> 51:42.365
instead of taking care
of business.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.534
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.

51:44.701 --> 51:48.454
Loose ends? The only fucking
loose end is Sonny.

51:48.622 --> 51:52.250
I am telling you, Vincent,
do not underestimate him.

51:52.417 --> 51:54.127
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.

51:54.294 --> 51:56.212
He'll always come through
the front door.

51:56.380 --> 51:58.256
Great, so we'll just wait
for the doorbell to ring, right?

51:58.423 --> 52:00.424
Mia, enough.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.235
We need a backup
register open, please.

52:19.403 --> 52:21.696
Backup register open, please.

52:26.326 --> 52:27.827
This what you want?

52:30.789 --> 52:32.957
All cashiers
please come to the front.

52:33.125 --> 52:35.126
All cashiers to the front.

52:51.476 --> 52:53.603
It's open, Vincent.

53:05.449 --> 53:07.909
We're done with
the small talk, hmm?

53:10.078 --> 53:11.537
Where are my diamonds?

53:11.705 --> 53:13.414
I sold them.

53:13.582 --> 53:16.042
Wrong answer.

53:21.089 --> 53:23.382
Oh, come on.

53:31.099 --> 53:34.393
So this is fun for you?
Huh?

53:36.563 --> 53:38.147
Want to go again?

53:38.315 --> 53:40.733
You have a lot
of nice things here.

53:49.701 --> 53:51.577
Is this all worth it?

53:54.373 --> 53:57.166
Yeah, it is.

53:57.334 --> 54:00.753
Ooh, scary-- blood.

54:08.971 --> 54:12.807
Give me my diamonds
and we're done.

54:12.975 --> 54:15.226
Fuck you!

54:40.961 --> 54:42.795
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.

54:42.963 --> 54:45.840
We'll get something
on the way back home.

54:47.259 --> 54:48.884
What you in the mood for?

54:49.052 --> 54:51.053
Shit, like a fucking salad.

54:51.221 --> 54:52.930
What the hell?

54:53.098 --> 54:55.141
What's wrong with you, man?

54:58.854 --> 55:01.564
Yo, Mia.

55:04.359 --> 55:06.777
Mia.

55:25.797 --> 55:27.631
Fuck.

55:32.012 --> 55:34.221
Mia?

55:41.813 --> 55:43.689
Fuck.

55:50.489 --> 55:52.698
Oh fuck.

55:54.701 --> 55:57.495
We've got to get
the fuck out of here, Vince.

55:57.662 --> 56:00.373
We've got to go.

56:00.540 --> 56:02.541
- Let's go.
- Get off me!

56:02.709 --> 56:06.045
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

56:06.213 --> 56:08.130
Shut up.

56:19.017 --> 56:21.519
I'm sorry, girl.

56:41.581 --> 56:44.458
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.

56:44.626 --> 56:46.085
No one's seen
or heard anything.

56:46.253 --> 56:48.003
They must have whacked
the both of them.

56:48.171 --> 56:50.423
Listen, you stupid fucking
Russian son of a bitch,

56:50.590 --> 56:52.758
if you're not gonna plan
on growing gills anytime soon,

56:52.926 --> 56:54.885
I'd suggest you tell the man
what he wants to know.

56:55.053 --> 56:57.012
Black man took the money.

56:57.180 --> 56:59.640
That's all I see.
He took it.

57:09.025 --> 57:12.194
10 bucks says when he comes up
for air he starts screaming about God.

57:12.362 --> 57:13.446
- 20.
- Bet.

57:13.613 --> 57:15.406
Bring him up.

57:18.577 --> 57:20.619
Oh, mother of God!

57:23.039 --> 57:25.958
Hey, Aqualung.

57:26.126 --> 57:28.127
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.

57:28.295 --> 57:31.213
Okay?
God has left Detroit.

57:31.381 --> 57:33.466
I'm your only god today.

57:33.633 --> 57:36.552
So you'd better tell me
what happened to my boy Petey,

57:36.720 --> 57:38.345
what happened
to the black man,

57:38.513 --> 57:40.723
and what happened
to my fucking money.

57:40.891 --> 57:43.976
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.

57:44.144 --> 57:47.688
He took your money.
I tell the truth. I tell the truth!

57:47.856 --> 57:49.815
You're a tough son of a bitch.

57:49.983 --> 57:51.984
Back in the pool, Tony.

57:58.116 --> 58:01.577
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.

58:01.745 --> 58:04.163
It was a ball. Way outside.

58:04.331 --> 58:05.956
No fucking way
that was a strike.

58:06.124 --> 58:08.501
Ump walked to the plate,
he couldn't see shit.

58:08.668 --> 58:10.294
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.

58:10.462 --> 58:13.172
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.

58:13.340 --> 58:14.965
He can't see anything.

58:16.009 --> 58:17.760
I think he's drowning, boss.

58:20.305 --> 58:21.847
Pull him up.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.687
I think he's dead.

58:28.855 --> 58:30.481
I think he was telling the truth.

58:32.192 --> 58:34.860
Listen, come and get me
after you clean this up.

58:35.028 --> 58:38.113
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do. Let's get him.

58:49.709 --> 58:53.379
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.

59:21.408 --> 59:24.285
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.

59:32.127 --> 59:34.336
- You're light.
- It's all there.

59:34.504 --> 59:37.548
No it isn't.
You're light.

59:37.716 --> 59:39.383
What the fuck are you
trying to say, Saunders?

59:39.551 --> 59:41.427
The warden said
the price went up.

59:41.595 --> 59:43.304
No no no.
We had a deal.

59:43.471 --> 59:46.599
Yeah, you paid for a year's
worth of protection.

59:46.766 --> 59:49.435
And now you're gonna
have to pay more.

59:49.603 --> 59:53.188
You want the old man kept
in protective custody?

59:53.356 --> 59:56.442
You pay $100,000 upfront.

59:56.610 --> 59:58.611
This is bullshit.

59:58.778 --> 01:00:00.446
How long do you think
that old man's

01:00:00.614 --> 01:00:02.948
gonna stay in
the general population?

01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:06.493
I give him two days before
the brothers cut him a new one.

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.829
You want that on your head?

01:00:08.997 --> 01:00:13.167
I know you're about family,
so do the right thing, Vince.

01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:15.586
Be the good son.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.887
You'd better think this through
before you pull that trigger.

01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:27.806
You fuck up with us

01:00:27.974 --> 01:00:30.017
and your old man's
a stain on the floor.

01:00:30.185 --> 01:00:32.519
Got it?

01:00:32.687 --> 01:00:35.606
You got 24 hours.

01:00:35.774 --> 01:00:37.941
Or we feed him to the animals.

01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:40.235
Get out.

01:01:19.317 --> 01:01:21.318
Mia's dead.

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:30.369
What do you want me to say?

01:01:30.537 --> 01:01:33.539
Say fucking something.
Anything.

01:01:33.707 --> 01:01:34.832
There's nothing to say.

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:36.667
You don't even
want to know how?

01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:38.419
It doesn't fucking matter.

01:01:38.586 --> 01:01:40.713
You're out there making
mistake after mistake.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.381
And you wonder why she's dead?

01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:43.966
What am I doing wrong?

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.468
Well, Sonny for one.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.347
How do you know
about Sonny?

01:01:50.515 --> 01:01:52.224
He came to visit me.

01:01:52.392 --> 01:01:54.143
He sat right where
you're sitting right now

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:57.062
on the other side of this glass
and he looked me in the eye.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.732
Can you do the same?

01:02:01.735 --> 01:02:03.360
I'm doing my best.

01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:05.112
Well, it's not good enough.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.156
What am I supposed to do?

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:14.747
You really are a little shit.
You know that?

01:02:14.914 --> 01:02:17.124
I never thought
I'd have to say that.

01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:21.211
Big men make
big moves, Vincent.

01:02:21.379 --> 01:02:23.922
Are you a big man?

01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:53.011
Hey.

01:04:24.419 --> 01:04:26.795
I knew Biggs
had to be hot on my trail.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:29.172
You don't take $2 million
from a guy like that

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.091
and expect him
to forget about it.

01:04:35.763 --> 01:04:38.599
No no, you've got
to explain it to me again.

01:04:40.226 --> 01:04:42.811
The same guy that
shot you whacked Petey,

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:45.856
took my money, and you want me
to believe that?

01:04:46.024 --> 01:04:47.733
Yes.

01:04:47.901 --> 01:04:51.194
I told you I was looking for him
when you first grabbed me, remember?

01:04:51.362 --> 01:04:53.530
You think I'd be sitting here
if I had your money?

01:04:53.698 --> 01:04:55.991
Shit, I ain't crazy.

01:05:01.414 --> 01:05:02.831
What?

01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:09.296
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.

01:05:09.464 --> 01:05:11.715
Your friend Vincent?

01:05:11.883 --> 01:05:13.675
Yes.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:17.137
I know where Vincent is
and I know where the money is.

01:05:17.305 --> 01:05:20.223
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.

01:05:20.391 --> 01:05:23.852
An army of juvenile
delinquents with pistols?

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.688
Give me some of your men and we'll go
get the money and bring it right back.

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:30.442
I have a different plan.
Come on.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.619
You all right?

01:05:40.787 --> 01:05:42.245
Yeah, I'm cool.

01:05:42.413 --> 01:05:44.539
You sure?

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.377
All right.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.380
You want a drink?

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.590
No thank you.

01:05:54.676 --> 01:05:56.426
Might help you relax a little.

01:06:00.848 --> 01:06:03.892
Why is it rich people
are always telling me to relax?

01:06:05.687 --> 01:06:08.855
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.

01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:12.484
Young guys just want
to run through their life

01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:14.069
as fast as they can.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:17.572
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.

01:06:19.325 --> 01:06:21.451
It's short, real short.

01:06:21.619 --> 01:06:24.371
You get to be my age
you see just how short it is.

01:06:24.539 --> 01:06:27.582
The older you get, the closer
you get to your death,

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.585
you want to relax.
You want to take your time.

01:06:32.171 --> 01:06:33.839
There's no rush, kid.

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.802
You sure you don't want
that drink?

01:06:40.847 --> 01:06:42.848
Yeah, I'll take a drink.

01:06:43.016 --> 01:06:45.684
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:09.708
Crap.

01:07:14.213 --> 01:07:16.548
You should know I hate
this John R prick.

01:07:16.716 --> 01:07:19.843
Just let me do the talking
when we get there, all right?

01:07:36.778 --> 01:07:38.487
Hey, you go to church?

01:07:40.281 --> 01:07:42.407
I used to.

01:07:42.575 --> 01:07:45.452
It got to a point they didn't want
to see me there anymore.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.123
I still help them out
with donations.

01:07:51.918 --> 01:07:55.170
I could see those priests
up there sweating.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.422
I made them nervous.

01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:59.883
So you believe in God?

01:08:00.051 --> 01:08:03.011
I don't know
if I believe in their God.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:06.807
Yeah, I pray.

01:08:08.101 --> 01:08:09.726
I pray every night.

01:08:09.894 --> 01:08:13.105
I need a God that's got
a lot of forgiveness.

01:08:16.274 --> 01:08:18.276
You're gonna be
all right though.

01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:20.153
Don't worry about a thing.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.488
What's the matter, Vince? You look
like you've seen a fucking ghost.

01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:15.542
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.377
That's the kid
you wanted to see.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:19.962
Consider him delivered.

01:09:20.131 --> 01:09:22.299
Where's my money?

01:09:22.466 --> 01:09:23.841
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:25.510
Give him
his fucking money, Vince.

01:09:25.678 --> 01:09:27.888
I don't know what this dude
told you, but it's bullshit.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.515
Last chance.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.395
With all due respect,
I know exactly who you are

01:09:35.563 --> 01:09:37.272
and I would never
fucking steal--

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.774
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.943
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.694
That's for Petey.

01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:48.241
You got something
of this man's, you give it to him now.

01:09:48.408 --> 01:09:50.035
Or we could all die, John.

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:40.085
Shit.

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.430
Oh! Hey!

01:11:22.586 --> 01:11:25.130
Move!

01:11:45.526 --> 01:11:47.652
Watch out.

01:12:13.971 --> 01:12:15.805
Fuck!

01:12:36.702 --> 01:12:39.496
Saunders, don't you
fucking move my dad.

01:12:39.663 --> 01:12:42.040
I've got your money
and I'll be there in an hour.

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.420
Going somewhere?

01:12:47.588 --> 01:12:49.923
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:50.091 --> 01:12:51.549
That's not the topic.

01:12:51.717 --> 01:12:53.343
All right,
what is the topic?

01:12:53.511 --> 01:12:55.720
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.

01:12:55.888 --> 01:12:58.098
That's right.
Sit down.

01:12:58.265 --> 01:13:00.475
Sit down!

01:13:03.562 --> 01:13:07.315
You know, in some countries
they cut off the hand that steals.

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.526
And you stole from us.

01:13:09.693 --> 01:13:12.737
So the way I see it,
you have three choices:

01:13:12.905 --> 01:13:15.240
you can fuck around,

01:13:15.408 --> 01:13:17.325
in which case I kill you;

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:20.995
you can go for that gun
on the desk

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.623
and I kill you;

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:27.544
or you can just
give me the diamonds

01:13:27.711 --> 01:13:29.045
and I'll let you disappear.

01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:31.089
Yeah right.

01:13:31.257 --> 01:13:33.466
Look, my friend,

01:13:33.634 --> 01:13:36.928
you're not half as tough
as your little girlfriend.

01:13:37.096 --> 01:13:39.431
And at the end

01:13:39.598 --> 01:13:41.307
she talked.

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:45.770
So what is it going to be?

01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:47.856
She wasn't my girlfriend.

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:50.275
She was my family.

01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:59.868
You got off easy,
motherfucker.

01:15:47.768 --> 01:15:50.019
Isn't much fun dying,
huh, Vince?

01:15:51.063 --> 01:15:53.147
Start digging.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.067
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

01:15:56.235 --> 01:15:58.611
You want me to dig
my own goddamn grave?

01:15:58.779 --> 01:16:02.282
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.

01:16:04.285 --> 01:16:06.452
And make sure it's deep
so you're comfortable.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:08.997
How much do you want?

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:12.542
Huh? How much is my life
worth to you?

01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:16.296
A rat's skin is only worth
something to a rat, Vince.

01:16:16.463 --> 01:16:19.549
Man, bullshit.
Come on.

01:16:19.717 --> 01:16:22.010
Who are you to judge me?

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:25.430
You ever thought about where
the fuck you'd be without me?

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.767
Yeah, I thought about that

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:32.186
when I thought I was
taking my last breath.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:35.898
Man, who was the one
out there making contacts,

01:16:36.066 --> 01:16:38.109
setting up scores while you
and Dave was getting high?

01:16:38.277 --> 01:16:39.819
Huh? Me.

01:16:39.987 --> 01:16:41.738
Who was the one who
brought you in on shit,

01:16:41.905 --> 01:16:44.574
put money in your pockets,
helped you support your moms?

01:16:44.742 --> 01:16:47.660
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.

01:16:47.828 --> 01:16:49.329
That's what--

01:16:49.496 --> 01:16:51.998
We were family, man.
We were brothers.

01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:55.501
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:57.587
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.

01:16:57.755 --> 01:16:59.380
This is about us, man.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.467
How long before him and his big-ass
mouth would have got us all whacked?

01:17:09.099 --> 01:17:11.851
He was loyal.

01:17:15.147 --> 01:17:17.231
He was weak.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.442
He was my friend.

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:21.027
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?

01:17:21.195 --> 01:17:23.071
Oh fuck.

01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:27.784
Let me tell you something
as your friend, Sonny.

01:17:27.951 --> 01:17:30.953
Everything you got in this world
is because of me.

01:17:31.121 --> 01:17:34.040
Everything you fucking are
in this world

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:36.626
is because of me.

01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:38.711
What could you have gotten into

01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:40.755
that was so bad that you
couldn't tell me?

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.716
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:48.846
I had your back
since we were kids, man.

01:17:49.014 --> 01:17:51.766
And what do you do? You fucking
shoot me and leave me for dead.

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:55.103
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.689
I couldn't--
I needed all the money.

01:17:57.856 --> 01:18:00.066
They were gonna--
they were gonna kill my father.

01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:03.027
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.

01:18:04.571 --> 01:18:08.199
Sonny, you're right, man.

01:18:08.367 --> 01:18:10.868
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.

01:18:12.746 --> 01:18:15.289
But you-- you've gotta tell me,
what can I do right now?

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:18.668
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.

01:18:20.254 --> 01:18:22.714
You should have thought
about that before.

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:27.301
You make peace with God,
not me.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.637
Do it.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:32.557
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.

01:18:32.725 --> 01:18:35.601
'Cause you know what? You ain't nothing
in this world without me, man.

01:18:35.769 --> 01:18:38.604
You shoot me
and we're the same.

01:18:38.772 --> 01:18:40.857
We'll both be gone.

01:18:47.448 --> 01:18:49.282
We're not the same.

01:18:51.577 --> 01:18:53.703
You're fucking pathetic, man.

01:18:55.372 --> 01:18:57.707
Man, fuck you!

01:18:57.875 --> 01:18:59.709
Fuck you, man!

01:18:59.877 --> 01:19:01.335
I don't need you, Sonny.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.296
I don't need you, man.
You need me.

01:19:03.464 --> 01:19:06.632
You need me!

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.094
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.

01:19:10.262 --> 01:19:13.890
You hear me?
You hear me?!

01:19:14.057 --> 01:19:16.684
Fuck you!

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.187
I'll find your ass!

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.063
Fuck you, Sonny!

01:19:29.448 --> 01:19:31.991
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.247
Yo, it was nice
knowing you, buddy.

01:19:38.415 --> 01:19:40.374
Break it up! Make a hole!

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:43.419
- Get back! Get back!
- Back off!

01:19:43.587 --> 01:19:45.630
- Back off!
- I need a medic in Red.

01:19:45.798 --> 01:19:47.673
- Back up.
- Get back.

01:19:47.841 --> 01:19:50.301
Get back on the wall.
Get back.

01:19:50.469 --> 01:19:53.221
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.352
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.479
