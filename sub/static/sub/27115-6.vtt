09:22.567 --> 09:24.166
I'm actually gonna
call you out on it.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.533
Well, you can roll your eyes
and act like that,

09:26.567 --> 09:28.500
but you're lucky to be here
as well, quite frankly.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.133
- Well, then you don't have to
have me here, that's fine.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.600
- Jax, if you're going
to talk to me like this,

09:31.633 --> 09:33.200
I am not going to have it.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.000
- Am I supposed to just sit here
and be quiet? No.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.200
- I just see your attitude,
I see your body language,

09:36.233 --> 09:37.467
and I don't like it.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.633
- Your restaurant.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.467
- Um, one last thing
about Kristen, actually--

09:44.500 --> 09:45.700
- Yeah.

09:45.734 --> 09:48.133
Whenever James is DJing,
she's a trigger.

09:48.166 --> 09:50.166
She walks in here and she
attacks James every single time.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.700
- Oh, it's all Kristen's fault.
It's all Kristen's fault.

09:51.734 --> 09:53.467
- So, you're blaming
James's issues on Kristen?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.200
- It's amazing how Kristen's
becoming the villain here,

09:57.233 --> 09:59.100
when James has said...
- No, she's not.

09:59.133 --> 10:02.266
- The most disgusting things,
done some horrific things.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.066
- You bring the ----ing
trigger in here,

10:04.100 --> 10:05.500
and then you're all wondering
why he's blowing up.

10:05.533 --> 10:06.734
- That does not give him
the right to come in

10:06.767 --> 10:08.066
and call her fat,
call me a whore.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.000
- I'm not blaming it all on her.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.700
- James doesn't have
anyone in his life

10:11.734 --> 10:13.166
that holds him accountable.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.667
He has a girlfriend
that's a yes-man;

10:14.700 --> 10:16.266
he has friends
that are yes-men.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.300
That's a recipe
for ----ing disaster.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.066
- I'm just saying,
as a business owner,

10:21.100 --> 10:22.767
I would not let Kristen in here,
- Okay, you know what...

10:23.000 --> 10:25.333
- As a business owner, you
probably shouldn't employ James.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.066
We can go back and forth
all day, homegirl.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.333
- Bitch, you are
not better than me.

10:30.133 --> 10:34.166
- I do not support talking
to each other badly,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.066
or fat-shaming.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
I mean, for goodness' sake.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.700
Aren't we all
more evolved than that?

10:39.734 --> 10:41.567
James is not working here,

10:41.600 --> 10:45.300
and I 1,000% do not support
the way he spoke to Katie,

10:45.333 --> 10:47.266
or the way he rapped, okay?

10:47.300 --> 10:49.033
It would be very easy for me

10:49.066 --> 10:51.100
just to let him
have his job back,

10:51.133 --> 10:54.200
and that would make quite a few
people at Sur very happy...

10:54.233 --> 10:55.734
Are we good?
all: Yes.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.100
Anybody?

10:57.133 --> 10:59.033
- But how women are treated,

10:59.066 --> 11:01.500
that's of paramount
importance to me.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.767
- Awkward.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.266
- If he's not echoing
my sentiment,

11:04.300 --> 11:05.600
how could I have him
working for me?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.166
- Well, that was fun.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.100
- This is for all the boys
who have done stupid sh-- to us!

11:13.600 --> 11:15.133
- Mother----er!

11:20.467 --> 11:21.166
all: ♪ Girls go hard ♪

11:22.433 --> 11:24.600

11:26.767 --> 11:28.200

11:30.166 --> 11:31.667
Wait, do I look literary chic?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.667
- You do. You look like
Stephen King's daughter.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.400
You just need a knife
and some blood.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.266
This is, like, the first time

11:37.300 --> 11:39.033
I'm actually Skyping
with my publisher.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.000
I've only talked to her
on the phone.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.767
- Get your lighting,
get your lighting.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.400
- Yeah, I know, find my light,
find my light, find my light.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.400
Hi.
- Hi!

11:48.667 --> 11:50.033
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.066 --> 11:51.233
I'm so thrilled
to meet you guys.

11:51.266 --> 11:54.133
Um, I got a freaking book deal,

11:54.166 --> 11:57.066
and it's for a book called
"Next Level Basic,"

11:57.100 --> 12:00.200
which is about embracing
your basic bitch.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.033
It's like a manifesto.

12:17.767 --> 12:20.266
Less than three months.
Less--less than three months.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.367
So, September 1st.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.033
I will make that happen.

12:25.066 --> 12:26.300
Holy freaking sh--.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.734
Thank y'all so much.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.400
Bye!
all: Bye.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.200
Bye.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.000
- I'm sweating.
I'm sweating.

12:37.033 --> 12:39.066
My heart is in my ----ing butt.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.700
Oh, my God, I can't even--

12:40.734 --> 12:42.767
- Should I leave now, so you
can start your first chapter?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.233
- No, not yet,
I need to calm down.

12:44.266 --> 12:46.233
I can't just, like,
transfer this energy

12:46.266 --> 12:47.333
into writing right now...

12:47.367 --> 12:48.633
- I can't do that.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.734
There's so much else to do.

12:51.767 --> 12:55.000
Like, Kristen, um, her mom's
getting in town today.

12:55.033 --> 12:58.166
We're having a mom/girls night
on Friday night.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.300
- Wait, so, Doute,
Katie, and your mom...

13:00.333 --> 13:03.367
- Well, so, Katie's mom
and my mom are best friends.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.233
They just love
to drink wine, gossip.

13:06.266 --> 13:09.200
They're just like
older versions of us.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.066
I always thought that
I was kinda no-filtery

13:11.100 --> 13:12.367
because of my dad,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.166
but maybe it's also
because of my mom.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.400
- You need a light down there,
honey, for your package.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.333
Can almost hang
an ornament on you.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.100
- She just doesn't care
about the way she acts,

13:21.133 --> 13:23.100
or, like, making somebody else
feel uncomfortable.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.767
Me and Katie will literally
be listening to our moms.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.467
We're like,
"Is this our future?"

13:29.300 --> 13:32.166
- Yeah. That is your future.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.700
♪ ♪

13:35.734 --> 13:37.367
- Great.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.300
♪ ♪

13:42.333 --> 13:44.200
- The crispy chicken
was really good,

13:44.233 --> 13:46.000
wasn't it, Giggy? Really good.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.300
Where are they, the boys?

13:47.333 --> 13:49.100
What are we doing?
What are we waiting for?

13:49.133 --> 13:50.433
- Exactly.

13:50.467 --> 13:52.400
- Thanks, darling.
Half a glass, thank you.

13:52.433 --> 13:55.734
So, the party on the 11th,

13:55.767 --> 13:58.300
I know it's technically
not the opening party,

13:58.333 --> 14:00.300
but it's the first event
we'll do.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.166
Daily Mail TV reached out to us,

14:02.200 --> 14:05.066
and asked us if we would host
their annual party

14:05.100 --> 14:06.700
at our new venue, TomTom.

14:06.734 --> 14:09.467
We have to go through
with that party...

14:09.500 --> 14:11.500
- Of course.
- And we've agreed to it.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.233
- They paid for it.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.400
- We're so far behind,
we're not ready,

14:14.433 --> 14:16.033
but we've already
committed to it.

14:16.066 --> 14:17.367
Their invitations have gone out.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.100
Oh, here they are.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.700
- Hi.
- Finally.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.133
- We gotta bring in
some stuff for you guys.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.367
Pandora's pretty much
taking over

14:23.400 --> 14:25.033
the cocktail menu for TomTom,

14:25.066 --> 14:27.266
but nothing is finalized yet...

14:27.300 --> 14:30.000
I'd love to call this
the Clockwork Pink.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.533
- Yes.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.533
So, Lisa has asked
Schwartz and I

14:34.567 --> 14:37.433
to come up with three cocktails
to audition for her

14:37.467 --> 14:41.000
to possibly serve
at the Daily Mail TV party,

14:41.033 --> 14:43.033
and maybe they can go on
the main cocktail menu.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.033
So, there's still a chance.

14:45.066 --> 14:46.367
- You know what I would like
on there?

14:46.400 --> 14:48.500
I would like a touch of spice
on there.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.133
- Yeah, like, some cayenne
on there or something.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.467
- Okay.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.033
She said she wants to add
a little spice.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.233
- Yeah.
- I think maybe jalapeño

14:56.266 --> 14:57.734
would be nice.
- Yeah.

14:57.767 --> 15:00.033
- I need the vote of confidence.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.367
Tom and I have about 25,
30 cocktails

15:02.400 --> 15:04.166
that we really love.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.300
We wanna deliver, you know?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.166
We wanna knock their socks off.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.533
- This is called
the Cape Canaveral Caprese.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.533
I'd like to serve it
as an appetizer.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.300
- All right, this is
like a mezcal cocktail

15:13.333 --> 15:14.467
with training wheels.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.433
- It's apricot brandy, mezcal,

15:16.467 --> 15:18.266
and a little bit
of ginger agave.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.133
- This is the Matcha-Bucha.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.433
- I don't like
the color of this.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.266
That looks too healthy for me.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.567
- This is matcha green tea

15:25.600 --> 15:28.200
with a green tea liqueur,
Hendrick's Gin,

15:28.233 --> 15:30.567
and then kombucha as well.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.200
- I like it.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.000
- It also gives you
a little energy too.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.567
- How can anything
with gin in it give you energy?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.200
Give me a break.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.533
- This is supposed to be
one of our stars.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.467
- I like it,
but I think maybe it needs,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.433
like, a twist of lemon
in it or something.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.200
- This is, uh, absinthe.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.000
- Oh, well, if I have to.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.033
- This is the Alchemy Rose.

15:48.066 --> 15:49.333
This should be a crowd-pleaser.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.166
It's got a little
Hendrick's Gin.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
It's got a hibiscus tea nectar.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.033
- Oh, I love this.

15:55.066 --> 15:56.633
- This is off the hook.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.066
- Yes!

16:00.533 --> 16:03.100
- For the Daily Mail TV party,
it's this...

16:04.400 --> 16:06.000
- Okay, so, you like
the Alchemy Rose,

16:06.033 --> 16:07.500
the Matcha-Bucha,
and the Clockwork Pink.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.233
- Good job.
- Thank you.

16:09.266 --> 16:11.166
- You kind of, like,
surprised me.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.367
I really have
to give it to them.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.500
I mean, I'm not a mixologist,

16:13.533 --> 16:15.166
but I actually have to say,

16:15.200 --> 16:17.567
some of them are
really damn good.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.233
We've got a 55-foot truck
coming across the country.

16:21.266 --> 16:22.500
- That's huge.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.133
- Nick and Elena are
arriving tomorrow,

16:24.166 --> 16:26.233
so the whole process
starts tomorrow.

16:26.266 --> 16:28.200
This is the part
of building a restaurant

16:28.233 --> 16:31.200
that I absolutely adore,
apart from doing the food:

16:31.233 --> 16:33.200
Making it beautiful.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.100
And I have the perfect person
to make it beautiful with,

16:35.133 --> 16:36.500
and that would be Nick Alain.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.266
How are you, genius,
maestro man?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.367
- The guy is a genius,
and you know for me to say that,

16:43.400 --> 16:45.133
so that's why I wanted you
to come and see it.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.533
When he's hauling everything in,

16:46.567 --> 16:48.233
Nick is gonna be
really strict.

16:48.266 --> 16:49.500
He's not gonna have
anybody in there.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.400
I mean, we're allowed
in there, but...

16:51.433 --> 16:54.600
Nick's first exposure
to Tom and Tom

16:54.633 --> 16:58.200
was when they had been drinking
for three days in Vegas.

16:58.233 --> 17:00.433
- What if we had this at the bar
and we lifted it up?

17:00.467 --> 17:02.400
- Be careful.
- Ooh, sorry, sorry.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.667
- I still think we should,
you know, smoking only--

17:03.700 --> 17:05.266
- Stop.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.533
- You know,
for the installation,

17:06.567 --> 17:08.100
let Nick do his thing.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.600
Just don't come in.

17:09.633 --> 17:12.266
And then, we're gonna bring
you in for the big reveal.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.266
It won't be finished,
but it will be, like,

17:14.300 --> 17:17.200
a resemblance of
what it's gonna look like.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.500
- I'd like to be in there,
you know, sweating with them,

17:19.533 --> 17:22.066
part of the team, you know?

17:22.100 --> 17:24.166
But...

17:24.200 --> 17:26.133
it's cool.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.066
- I'd love to!

17:32.533 --> 17:34.266
- Why do you think I won't
sleep with you?

17:34.300 --> 17:35.500
- Because you're not
attracted to me?

17:35.533 --> 17:37.300
- He's a douche...

17:37.333 --> 17:39.633
- He's a cheesy douche.

17:45.533 --> 17:46.066
- ♪ Living

17:46.066 --> 17:46.500
- ♪ Living

33:19.667 --> 33:21.533

relationship that she's had,

33:27.500 --> 33:28.633

Don't know where

35:07.700 --> 35:09.533
Let's put everything aside
right now.

35:09.567 --> 35:12.033
I wanna get down
to the bottom of

35:12.066 --> 35:13.667
why you feel you need
to attack people

35:13.700 --> 35:15.633
on such a hurtful level,

35:15.667 --> 35:17.767
and why you continue to do it,
even when you say you're sorry.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.500
- It's the alcohol.
It's the alcohol.

35:20.533 --> 35:22.600
- The thing is is
I'm the same way.

35:22.633 --> 35:24.734
- So, you understand.
- Yes.

35:24.767 --> 35:26.300
But at some point, James,
we gotta go,

35:26.333 --> 35:27.633
"We're getting too old
for this."

35:27.667 --> 35:30.333
We can't be attacking people
and their boyfriends

35:30.367 --> 35:31.667

35:31.700 --> 35:34.300
and calling me a whore
at ----ing Pride.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.700
- Kristen,
I don't remember Pride,

35:36.734 --> 35:38.066
and I know that's
not an excuse again.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.233
I know it's not.

35:39.266 --> 35:40.567
- It's really bad, James,

35:40.600 --> 35:41.700
and I don't think
you realize it.

35:41.734 --> 35:43.667

Lala, I'm, like,

35:45.567 --> 35:48.300

my brothers through school.

And then, I obviously miss
our friendship a lot, you know?
