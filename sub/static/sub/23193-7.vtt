WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:10.811
- LIFE--
IT'S LITERALLY ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.213
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.246 --> 00:14.348
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:14.382 --> 00:15.716
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.018
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.154
VIVA LA REVOLUCION!

00:20.188 --> 00:21.622
[people cheering]

00:23.224 --> 00:25.359
[screams]

00:33.201 --> 00:35.536
WELCOME TO REVIEW.
I'M FORREST MACNEIL.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.006
I RATE LIFE EXPERIENCES
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FIVE STARS

00:39.039 --> 00:40.874
ON TELEVISION FOR A LIVING.

00:40.908 --> 00:41.875
AND THIS IS A.J. GIBBS.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.711
SHE HELPS ME.
- I DO.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.945
- [laughs]
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT

00:44.978 --> 00:46.247
THAT FIRST REVIEW IS FOR TODAY.
- OKAY.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.515
- SHALL WE?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.250
- THIS ONE
COMES TO US FROM TYLER

00:49.283 --> 00:51.285
IN GREAT FALLS, MONTANA.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.387
- COUPLE GUYS FROM WEST HIGH
JUMPED OUR QUARTERBACK,

00:53.421 --> 00:55.956
AND WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING
OVER THERE TO [bleep] THEM UP.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.458
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON REVENGE?

00:57.491 --> 00:59.360
- OH, MY.
REVENGE.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.296
WHAT IS IT LIKE
TO SETTLE A SCORE?

01:02.330 --> 01:04.665
I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.968
I BEGAN THIS EXPERIENCE
BY LOOKING BACK THROUGH MY LIFE

01:08.001 --> 01:10.671
FOR A TIME WHEN I FELT
PERSONALLY WRONGED BY SOMEONE

01:10.704 --> 01:12.140
I COULD NOW TAKE REVENGE ON.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.942
OH, TIM.
OH, I THINK HE DIED.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.444
THEN, IT HIT ME.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.147
THIS IS
MY SEVENTH GRADE YEARBOOK.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.516
THIS PROMISING YOUNG MAN HERE
IS A YOUNG FORREST MACNEIL.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.353
AND THAT RIGHT THERE IS
THE LOVELY MISS JENNA MITCHELL.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.855
NOW, THAT YEAR I HAD FINALLY
SCREWED UP THE COURAGE

01:27.888 --> 01:30.324
TO ASK JENNA MITCHELL
TO THE WINTER DANCE.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.161
AND WHILE SHE WAS TAKING
A COMPLETELY REASONABLE 24 HOURS

01:33.194 --> 01:35.363
TO CONSIDER MY INVITATION,

01:35.396 --> 01:37.798
THIS YOUNG MAN
ENTERED THE STORY.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.533
RANDY ROMER.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.870
HE SPREAD A RUMOR THAT THE
REASON I HAD CHANGED INTO SHORTS

01:42.903 --> 01:44.838
FOR THE SECOND HALF
OF THE SCHOOL DAY WAS THAT

01:44.872 --> 01:47.708
I HAD DEFECATED
IN MY CORDUROY PANTS.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.510
THAT WAS A LIE.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.247
BUT IT JUST COLORFUL ENOUGH TO
CAPTURE THE POPULAR IMAGINATION,

01:53.281 --> 01:57.818
AND JENNA MITCHELL DID NOT
GO WITH ME TO THAT DANCE.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.921
I NEVER DID ANYTHING
TO GET BACK AT RANDY FOR THAT.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.824
BUT I THINK
THE TIME HAS COME.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.994
THANKS TO THE INTERNET, IT TOOK
MY ASSISTANT, LUCILLE, LESS TIME

02:07.027 --> 02:09.897
TO DETERMINE THAT RANDY ROMER IS
CURRENTLY AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR

02:09.930 --> 02:12.200
OF CLASSICS
AT A NEARBY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:12.200 --> 02:13.567
THAN IT DID
TO SAY THIS SENTENCE.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.269
WOW.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.939
- DANTE PEOPLED HIS VISION
OF HELL WITH HIS ENEMIES.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.575
- I DECIDED TO PULL A PRANK
THAT WOULD REQUIRE

02:21.609 --> 02:24.345
A MASTERFULLY SUBTLE
AND CONVINCING PERFORMANCE.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.280
[Italian accent]
EXCUSE ME.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.750
IS THIS THE CLASSROOM
OF PROFESSORE ROMER?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.919
- UH, YES.
CAN I HELP YOU?

02:31.952 --> 02:34.488
- YES,
I'M FROM MORETTI'S DRY CLEANING,

02:34.522 --> 02:35.656
AND I'M HERE TO DROP OFF
YOUR UNDERWEARS.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.625
[laughter]
- I'M SORRY.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.461
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG CLASSROOM.
PLEASE TRY THE BURSAR'S OFFICE.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.829
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
PROFESSORE.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.531
I'M IN THE RIGHT CLASSROOM.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.967
YOU REMEMBER, YOU DROP OFF
A PAIR OF UNDERWEARS WITH US

02:47.000 --> 02:50.838
THAT HAD THE BIGGEST POOP STAIN
ON 'EM ANYBODY EVER SAW.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.306
[laughter]
- OKAY, NOW, LOOK.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.874
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
SOME KIND OF A PRANK.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.309
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID

02:55.343 --> 02:57.245
WHEN WE HAD A LOOK
AT THESE UNDERWEARS.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.680
WE SAID, "SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A PRANK."

02:59.713 --> 03:01.081
BUT IT WAS THE TRUTH.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.016
- AND--AND IT'S
A STUPID PRANK TOO.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.253
WHAT KIND OF DRY CLEANER
WOULD HAND-DELIVER

03:05.253 --> 03:08.256
A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR
TO MY WORKPLACE, HUH?

03:08.256 --> 03:10.391
- WELL, THAT'S--YES.
THAT'S A--THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.759
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.026
- YEAH.
- WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHY?

03:13.060 --> 03:14.962
I GOTTA LAY MY OWN EYES
ON THE GUY

03:14.995 --> 03:17.265
THAT MAKE THIS BIG POOP STAIN
IN HIS UNDERWEARS.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.466
[laughter]
IT'S A BIG POOP STAIN.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.701
- PUT THE PHONES DOWN.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.803
- YOU MUST HAVE HAD TO WEAR
THE SAME PAIR OF UNDERWEARS

03:22.836 --> 03:25.473
FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS AND NEVER
TAKE OFF YOUR UNDERWEARS

03:25.506 --> 03:26.774
TO MAKE THE POOP.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.276
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
PROFESSOR ROMER?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.943
- I'M GONNA CALL
CAMPUS SECURITY, OKAY?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.612
- THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU'RE CRAZY, PROFESSOR ROMER.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.113
- DON'T SAY THAT!
- IT'S CRAZY!

03:33.146 --> 03:34.782
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.149
- I'M NOT CRAZY!
- HERE'S THE ONLY THING

03:36.183 --> 03:38.919
THIS GUY CAN TEACH
A CLASS ABOUT--POOP!

03:38.952 --> 03:40.588
- GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE!
- IT'S THE ONLY THING

03:40.621 --> 03:41.889
HE CAN TEACH A CLASS--
- LET'S GO!

03:41.922 --> 03:44.292
- OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.094
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, RANDY.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.929
FORREST MACNEIL.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.599
PAYBACK'S A BITCH, ISN'T IT?
- WHAT?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.667
- ARRIVEDERCI!

03:53.701 --> 03:57.938
[cheers and applause]

03:57.971 --> 04:01.409
- ALL RIGHT, FORREST.
THAT LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.010
- THAT CERTAINLY WAS
A LOT OF FUN.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.413
IT MAY SOUND SILLY,
BUT GIVING RANDY ROMER BACK

04:05.446 --> 04:08.549
EXACTLY WHAT HE GAVE ME
WAS A REAL SELF-ESTEEM BOOSTER.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.318
YOU KNOW, I CAN STAND UP
A LITTLE TALLER NOW,

04:10.351 --> 04:13.020
KNOWING THAT I AM NOT SOMEONE
TO BE MESSED WITH.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.589
SO I GIVE REVENGE
THE FULL FIVE STARS.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.725
AND REALLY WHAT--OH, MY--
- OH, MY GOD!

04:17.758 --> 04:19.360
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

04:19.393 --> 04:23.564
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?
- [speaks foreign language]

04:23.597 --> 04:25.999
HUZZAH! HUZZAH!
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

04:26.033 --> 04:27.034
- HUZZAH!
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.369
- THAT IS [bleep].
- WHAT?

04:28.402 --> 04:30.103
- THAT'S [bleep].
- OH, MY GOD!

04:30.137 --> 04:31.705
- RANDY ROMER
JUST WALKED IN HERE

04:31.739 --> 04:33.374
AND THREW [bleep]...
- OH, MY GOD!

04:33.407 --> 04:36.009
- IN MY STUDIO
AND ON A.J. [bleep] GIBBS!

04:36.043 --> 04:38.612
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!
- THERE'S [bleep] IN MY HAIR!

04:38.646 --> 04:39.913
- THERE'S [bleep]
ALL OVER YOU!

04:39.947 --> 04:41.549
- OH, MY GOD!
[screaming hysterically]

04:41.582 --> 04:44.184
- ALL RIGHT.
I AM COMING FOR YOU!

04:44.217 --> 04:47.054
AND I'M BRINGING HELL WITH ME!
- KILL HIM, FORREST!

04:47.087 --> 04:48.722
YOU KILL HIM!

04:48.756 --> 04:49.857
- DID YOU SEE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.124
- INCREDIBLE.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.360
- THAT IS NOT
GONNA GO UNANSWERED.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.761
NO, THANK YOU.
WHERE IS HE?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.696
- [cries]

04:55.729 --> 04:58.766
- WHAT I DID TO ROMER WAS WELL
WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF FAIR PLAY.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.368
I WAS RIGHTING A WRONG.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.536
BUT HIS LITTLE PRANK BACK THERE
WAS OVER THE LINE.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.638
I'M GONNA GET HIM BACK,
AND IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.806
HEY, LUCILLE.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.708
I NEED GERMAN DIALECT TAPES

05:07.741 --> 05:09.477
AND A PAIR OF LEDERHOSEN,
PLEASE.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.979
RANDY ROMER
JUST THREW A BAG OF POOP ON ME.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.782
- I'M MAKING POO!
I'M MAKING POO!

05:14.815 --> 05:15.849
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:15.883 --> 05:19.387
- MAKING POO!
- OH, GOD.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.389
- I AM AN ANIMAL!

05:21.389 --> 05:23.657
I AM ANIMAL!
[cackles]

05:23.691 --> 05:25.158
ANIMAL!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.294
- WITNESSING RANDY
RUNNING THROUGH THE OFFICE

05:27.395 --> 05:30.831
WITH HIS PANTS DOWN BROUGHT BACK
A SECOND, DEEPER MEMORY

05:30.864 --> 05:33.667
THAT OCCURRED NOT LONG AFTER
THE JENNA MITCHELL INCIDENT,

05:33.701 --> 05:36.303
WHEN RANDY WAS CARRIED
OUT OF SCHOOL NAKED

05:36.404 --> 05:38.238
AND COMMITTED
TO A MENTAL INSTITUTION

05:38.271 --> 05:41.875
FOR FEEDING OUR CLASS GUINEA PIG
TO HIS NEIGHBOR'S ROTTWEILER.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.911
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.618
- [clears throat]
I HAVE DECIDED TO COME HERE

05:50.651 --> 05:52.753
AND APOLOGIZE
TO PROFESSOR ROMER

05:52.786 --> 05:55.689
AND TO GIVE HIM THIS GIFT
AS A PEACE OFFERING.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.859
NOT TOTALLY SURE THAT
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE GIFT,

05:58.892 --> 06:02.095
BUT I HOPE THAT HE ACCEPTS IT IN
THE SPIRIT THAT IT WAS INTENDED.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.533
HERE HE IS.
OKAY.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.435
PROFESSOR ROMER.
- WHAT?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.236
NOW YOU COME TO MY HOUSE...
- OH--

06:09.269 --> 06:11.705
- WHERE MY FAMILY LIVES?
- JUST RELAX. RELAX, OKAY?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.941
- I HAVE FIVE KNIVES
HIDDEN ON MY BODY!

06:13.974 --> 06:15.208
- THERE WILL BE NO NEED
FOR KNIFE PLAY TODAY.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.710
I'M HERE TO APOLOGIZE.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.847
I AM SORRY FOR WHAT I DID
IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.114
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I WAS TRYING TO GET BACK AT YOU

06:21.148 --> 06:22.450
FOR SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US

06:22.450 --> 06:24.518
IN THE EIGHTH GRADE.
- WHAT THING?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.086
- IT WAS WITH JENNA MITCHELL...
- JENNA MITCHELL.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.521
- WHEN YOU TOLD HER
THAT I HAD SOILED MY PANTS.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.889
I SHOULD'VE LET IT GO
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.091
- OH, GOD, I DID SO MANY THINGS
BACK THEN.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.893
I WAS A TROUBLED CHILD.
- RIGHT.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.261
LET'S END THIS IN FRIENDSHIP.
- OKAY.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.529
- I HAVE BROUGHT YOU
A PEACE OFFERING.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.565
LET US SHAKE HANDS
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.099
AND THAT IS FOR YOU.
- FOR ME?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.868
- YES.
UH--

06:40.901 --> 06:42.470
- YOU DO KNOW
IF THIS IS [bleep],

06:42.470 --> 06:43.804
I'M GONNA DECAPITATE YOU?

06:43.837 --> 06:47.808
- [laughs]
AND YOU WOULD BE RIGHT TO.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.844
- OKAY.
- UH...

06:53.847 --> 06:57.551
- [laughs]
- IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

06:57.585 --> 06:58.819
- IT'S A T--
- OKAY.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.521
- TOILET.
HE'S ON THE TOILET.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.989
- IT'S CALLED
THE TOILET TREASURY,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.491
AND IT'S JUST--
IT'S FULL OF STORIES

07:03.491 --> 07:05.058
AND JOKES AND TRIVIA,
JUST ALL ABOUT GOING

07:05.092 --> 07:06.794
TO THE BATHROOM, AND--
LISTEN, IT'S NO DANTE.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.996
- OH, IT'S BETTER THAN DANTE.
[laughter]

07:09.029 --> 07:10.363
- LET'S CATCH UP SOMETIME,

07:10.397 --> 07:11.799
SHALL WE?
- OH, I'D LIKE THAT.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.166
- GOOD. YES.
ALL RIGHT.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.301
BE WELL, PROFESSORE.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.003
[laughs]

07:16.036 --> 07:18.672
[sighs]
THAT WENT WELL.

07:18.706 --> 07:22.375
YOU KNOW, IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT ENDING A CYCLE OF REVENGE

07:22.409 --> 07:25.178
TAKES QUITE A BIT MORE COURAGE
THAN STARTING ONE.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.681
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IT FEELS BETTER.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.150
OF COURSE, IT'S EXCITING
TO BE AT WAR WITH--OH!

07:30.183 --> 07:32.853
- WHAT IS THIS?
- HOLY [bleep].

07:32.886 --> 07:33.854
- IT'S [bleep]!
[screams]

07:33.887 --> 07:35.188
- WHAT HAPPENED?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.356
- WHOSE [bleep] IS IT?
- OH, MY GOD.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.891
OH, RANDY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.192
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CAR?
- IS THIS YOUR [bleep]?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.761
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
- OH, GOD.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
- WHAT? NO, NO, NO!

07:42.730 --> 07:43.764
OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.098
- I'M NOT READING YOUR BOOK NOW!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.534
- I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!

07:46.534 --> 07:47.535
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!
[screams]

07:47.535 --> 07:49.269
[bleep]!
OH, NO!

07:49.302 --> 07:50.738
[screams]
NO, NO, NO!

07:50.771 --> 07:53.073
WHAT SEPARATES MAN
FROM THE ANIMALS?

07:53.106 --> 07:56.777
NOT JUST TOILET USE,
BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO REASON.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.547
REVENGE APPEALS
TO OUR BASER INSTINCTS,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.949
WHILE ONLY EMPATHY
AND FORGIVENESS CAN END

08:01.982 --> 08:04.117
THE CYCLE OF MADNESS.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.819
I HAVE TO CONFESS,

08:05.853 --> 08:07.320
I'M STILL COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED
BY THAT LAST ATTACK.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.189
I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE PROFESSOR ROMER

08:09.222 --> 08:11.358
COULD'VE MADE SO FURIOUS THAT
THEY WENT TO ALL THE TROUBLE

08:11.391 --> 08:12.793
OF CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING
AS COMPLICATED

08:12.826 --> 08:15.462
AS AN IGNITION-TRIGGERED
FECES BOMB.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.264
- OH, I BET IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED

08:17.297 --> 08:19.266
IF YOU DATED A GUY
WHO'S AN AUTO MECHANIC

08:19.299 --> 08:20.634
WITH A BROTHER
WHO'S A NAVY SEAL.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.836
I BET AFTER KILLING
OSAMA BIN LADEN,

08:22.870 --> 08:24.304
THAT'S JUST A DAY
AT THE BEACH.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.039
- RIGHT, YES.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.376
WELL, TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGE,

08:29.409 --> 08:31.311
I RECOMMEND SOMETHING ELSE.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.347
REVENGE, ONE STAR.
- FIVE STARS.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.291
- ALL RIGHT, A.J.,
I'M READY FOR MY NEXT REVIEW.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.928
- WELL, FORREST,
DARREN IN LA JOLLA ASKS...

08:54.835 --> 08:56.970
- OH, WOW.
GREAT QUESTION.

08:57.004 --> 09:01.909
I AM ABOUT TO GO GET RICH,
AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT SLOWLY.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.311
TRUTH BE TOLD,
I NEEDED THIS ASSIGNMENT.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.813
REVIEWING LIFE EXPERIENCES

09:05.846 --> 09:08.481
WAS TURNING OUT TO BE
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.383
COCAINE IS AMAZING!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.352
[screams]
[glass shatters]

09:12.385 --> 09:15.823
THAT IS A TICKET
TO GO INTO SPACE.

09:15.856 --> 09:20.427
MY REVIEW OF DIVORCE ALONE WAS
COSTING ME A FORTUNE IN ALIMONY

09:20.460 --> 09:23.631
AND LEFT ME SLEEPING
IN MY OFFICE.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.032
- THIS IS THAD VALENTINE.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.035
HE IS A FINANCIAL GURU.
HE IS AMAZING.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.903
- MY EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT,
LUCILLE,

09:29.937 --> 09:31.872
URGED ME TO ATTEND
A SEMINAR ENTITLED

09:31.905 --> 09:34.207
"BRING YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.710
AND LEAVE WITH
YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR REALITY."

09:36.744 --> 09:42.650
- IT IS $1,776 TO ACHIEVE
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE, OKAY?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.852
DO YOU GET IT?
1776.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.956
WELL,
PLUS A $200 PROCESSING FEE.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.057
[applause]

09:50.090 --> 09:52.660
- ARE YOU WORTH
$1 MILLION?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.394
all: YES.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.764
- ARE YOU WORTH $1 MILLION?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.231
all: YES!
- YES!

09:58.265 --> 10:00.734
- THAD VALENTINE WAS
A HIGH-ENERGY SPEAKER

10:00.768 --> 10:03.103
WITH A TALENT FOR TALKING
TO THE COMMON MAN.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.938
- I USED TO BE JUST LIKE YOU.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.075
LONELY, LOST, AND UGLY.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.609
[applause]

10:09.643 --> 10:10.911
HERE'S WHAT I DID--

10:10.944 --> 10:13.280
I WROTE MYSELF A CHECK
FOR $1 MILLION,

10:13.313 --> 10:16.283
BUT I BACKDATED IT
AN ENTIRE YEAR.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.985
WHICH MEANS,
WHEN THAT TIME CAME UP,

10:18.018 --> 10:21.588
I HAD TO FIND $1 MILLION,
OR THE BANK WAS GONNA SAY TO ME,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.757
"WE'RE GONNA COME TO YOUR HOUSE,
WE'RE GONNA HANDCUFF YOU

10:23.791 --> 10:25.325
IN FRONT OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY,
WE'RE GONNA THROW YOU AWAY,

10:25.358 --> 10:27.928
AND LOCK THE KEY."
TRUE STORY.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
WHY?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.732
BECAUSE CONFIDENCE.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.102
[applause]
CONFIDENCE!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.636
YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.605
AND BE HONEST, OPEN UP.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.108
WHO'S A LITTLE SCARED
TO WALK ON HOT COALS TONIGHT?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.743
YEAH.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.912
- WAS IT POSSIBLE
THAT BECOMING MORE CONFIDENT

10:44.945 --> 10:46.980
COULD MAKE ME FABULOUSLY RICH?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.149
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.184
all: YES! YES!

10:51.218 --> 10:52.986
- THE AFTERNOON WAS
FULL OF INCREDIBLE,

10:53.020 --> 10:54.755
CONFIDENCE-BUILDING EXERCISES.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.289
YOU HAVE ALL GOT TO TRY THAT.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.091
YOU GOTTA TRY THAT.
YOU--

10:58.125 --> 10:59.492
I WAS FEELING MORE AND MORE

10:59.526 --> 11:01.862
PSYCHOLOGICALLY PREPARED
TO MAKE MY FORTUNE.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.431
I DID THIS TO MYSELF.
- I DID THIS TO MYSELF.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.100
- I DID THIS TO MYSELF.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.536
I HAD LEARNED SO MUCH
ABOUT CONFIDENCE

11:09.569 --> 11:11.739
THAT I WAS SPREADING IT
TO EVERYONE AROUND ME.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.207
- HAVE YOU, UH,
TRIED THESE DANISHES?

11:14.241 --> 11:15.909
THEY LOOK PRETTY GOOD.
- OH, YEAH, I DID.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.745
I HAD ONE OF THE CHERRY ONES.
- OH.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.747
- SO GOOD.
- THEY LOOK PRETTY--PRETTY GOOD.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.181
- YEAH, GO FOR IT.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.883
- I'VE ALWAYS
HAD A WEIGHT PROBLEM.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.219
MY DOCTORS SAY THAT
IT'S BECAUSE I EAT TOO MUCH,

11:26.253 --> 11:28.055
BUT WHO KNOWS, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.590
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW, IT IS NEVER
TOO LATE TO CHANGE.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.926
YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF
YOU'RE WORTH

11:32.960 --> 11:35.128
both: $1 MILLION.
- YOU'VE GOT IT.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.563
- [laughs]
HEY.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.799
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA?

11:38.832 --> 11:41.068
- SURE, YEAH.
I'M SURE IT'S GREAT.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.137
- OKAY.
- OH, YEAH.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.306
[chuckles]

11:46.339 --> 11:48.441
- IT'S A MUZZLE...
- MM-HMM.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.211
- THAT WORKS ON A TIME LOCK

11:51.244 --> 11:54.214
SO THAT YOU CAN'T EAT
BETWEEN MEALS.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.284
- OH, OKAY.
SO IT'S FOR PEOPLE?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.819
- UH-HUH.
- IT'S A MUZZLE FOR PEOPLE?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.453
- YEAH.
- AND IT, LIKE, COVERS UP

12:00.487 --> 12:02.155
YOUR MOUTH ALL DAY LONG,
EXCEPT FOR--

12:02.189 --> 12:03.523
- EXCEPT FOR MEALTIME.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.858
- AND THE REST
OF THE TIME OF THE DAY,

12:04.892 --> 12:06.559
YOUR MOUTH IS COVERED OVER
BY THIS--

12:06.593 --> 12:08.896
BY A MUZZLE?

12:08.929 --> 12:11.664
- YOU HATE IT?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.500
- WHO CARES WHAT I THINK?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.803
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU KNOW

12:15.803 --> 12:17.971
THAT YOU ARE WORTH $1 MILLION.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.372
- OH, YEAH.
- I KNOW I DO.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.074
- YEAH.
- I'M WORTH $1 MILLION.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.910
- $1 MILLION.
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.144
[laughs]
- COOL.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.578
- ALL RIGHT.
- $1 MILLION.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.980
- SEE YOU OUT THERE
ON THOSE COALS, OKAY?

12:27.014 --> 12:27.981
- OKAY.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.716
- NOW, I WANT ALL OF YOU

12:29.817 --> 12:31.351
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.687
THERE'S ONE THING
EACH OF YOU BROUGHT HERE TODAY--

12:34.721 --> 12:37.357
YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.027
THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SHOUT OUT

12:40.060 --> 12:44.998
AS YOU WALK
ACROSS THOSE HOT COALS.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.834
- EXCUSE ME.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.369
WERE WE SUPPOSED TO COME HERE
WITH A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA

12:49.402 --> 12:52.072
ALREADY IN MIND?
- YEAH.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.707
IT'S--IT'S THE HEART
OF "WEALTHNASTICS."

12:54.741 --> 12:57.044
- THIS IDEA--

12:57.077 --> 12:59.379
- OH, GOD.
OKAY.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.615
LUCILLE HAD GIVEN ME A PACKET OF
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SEMINAR

13:02.649 --> 13:04.651
BUT DID NOT INSIST
THAT I READ IT.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.254
HER NEGLIGENCE PUT ME
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.688
JUST THINK OF IT, JUST THINK
OF IT, JUST THINK OF IT.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.858
JUST SAY IT.
JUST SAY--JUST SAY ONE THING.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.961
I--A TOILET
THAT CAN FLUSH ITSELF

13:13.994 --> 13:16.029
OR A TOILET--A TOILET
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.132
OR A BATHROOM--WHY--

13:19.166 --> 13:21.268
ALL MY IDEAS
ARE ABOUT BATHROOMS.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.004
UM, OKAY.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.538
STUPID.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.107
[cheers and applause]
- HEY!

13:27.140 --> 13:29.476
WHO'S READY TO WALK
ON SOME HOT COALS?

13:29.509 --> 13:30.878
OKAY, PAULA, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.312
LET'S GO.
- GREAT.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.881
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.315
- YOU GOT IT, SISTER.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.984
GIVE ME
THAT MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.719
- A SELF-MOISTURIZING BRA!

13:39.752 --> 13:42.189
- YEAH!
YOU DID IT.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.626
OKAY, UP NEXT, MARIO!

13:46.659 --> 13:48.195
ALL RIGHT, MARIO.
KA-CHING.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.729
LET'S GO.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.564
- A TACO TRUCK WHERE
IF YOU PAY A LITTLE EXTRA

13:51.598 --> 13:53.166
YOU CAN EAT INSIDE THE TRUCK!

13:53.200 --> 13:56.636
- HEY, HEY, LIKE THAT!
THAT'S GREAT.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.538
UP NEXT, WE GOT FORREST.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.640
WHERE'S FORREST?
- ALL RIGHT.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.910
- THERE YOU GO.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.312
COME ON, FORREST.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.982
- CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF
IS AN AMAZING GIFT.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.952
IT IS NOT, HOWEVER,
THE SAME AS HAVING AN IDEA.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.989
UH, A, UH--A MUZZLE
THAT WORKS ON A TIME LOCK,

14:16.023 --> 14:18.125
SO YOU CAN'T EAT
BETWEEN MEALS!

14:18.158 --> 14:20.627
- HEY, HEY!
- [chuckles]

14:20.660 --> 14:23.296
- HEY, YOU STOLE MY IDEA,
ASS[bleep]!

14:23.330 --> 14:24.397
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.632
- THAT'S MY WHOLE LIFE!

14:25.665 --> 14:26.967
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
- IS THAT TRUE?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.101
- YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN ORIGINAL IDEA.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.302
- OW, OW, OW!

14:29.336 --> 14:30.938
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.405
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
COME ON, GET UP!

14:32.439 --> 14:35.608
[overlapping shouting]

14:36.944 --> 14:38.311
- WE'D ALL LIKE
TO AVOID A TRIAL,

14:38.345 --> 14:40.080
SO WE HAVE AN AMOUNT IN MIND,

14:40.113 --> 14:41.614
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE,
IT'S GENEROUS.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.685
- WELL, IT HAD BETTER
BE $1 MILLION.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.621
- NO.
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M WORTH.

14:48.655 --> 14:53.326
[clears throat]
I'M WORTH $1 MILLION.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.962
- IT'S 70,000.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.796
- NO WAY.

14:56.829 --> 15:01.334
OH, YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY TAKE IT.

15:01.368 --> 15:07.307
- I AM WORTH $70,000.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.777
- I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

15:10.810 --> 15:13.046
NOTHING WILL EVER GO WELL
FOR YOU, FORREST.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.614
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.684
I JUST GOT $70,000 FOR BURNING
MY HANDS AND FEET.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.452
AND IT'S ABOUT TO GET
EVEN BETTER,

15:19.486 --> 15:21.221
BECAUSE I HAVE INVESTED
EVERY PENNY OF IT

15:21.254 --> 15:23.056
IN THAT WOMAN'S
TIME LOCK MUZZLE.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.058
THERE'S AN OBESITY CRISIS
IN THIS COUNTRY,

15:25.092 --> 15:26.994
AND I THINK THE ANSWER
MAY VERY WELL BE

15:26.994 --> 15:29.296
LOCKING UP PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.333
GETTING RICH QUICK,
FOUR STARS.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.212
- A.J., MY NEXT REVIEW,
PLEASE.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.847
- THE NEXT REVIEW REQUEST
COMES TO US VIA TWITTER

15:47.880 --> 15:49.516
FROM @BUBBLEBATHS.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.883
- AH, AND WHAT WOULD
@BUBBLEBATHS

15:50.917 --> 15:52.085
LIKE TO SEE ME REVIEW?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.621
- THE TWEET SAYS...

15:59.626 --> 16:01.594
- IS THERE--IS THERE MORE
TO THAT, OR IS THAT--

16:01.628 --> 16:03.730
- NO.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.598
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

16:05.632 --> 16:08.168
- THERE ALL IS--YEAH.
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

16:08.201 --> 16:10.470
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.106
- [laughs] YEAH, WELL,
IT'S GOOD THAT I'M THE REVIEWER

16:13.140 --> 16:15.742
IN SITUATIONS
EXACTLY LIKE THIS

16:15.775 --> 16:20.247
SO THAT I CAN OFFER
UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.049
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

16:22.049 --> 16:24.951
AND HERE I GO,
DOING EXACTLY THAT.

16:25.052 --> 16:28.155
GOOD.
- OOH.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.490
- "THERE ALL IS ACHING."

16:30.523 --> 16:33.626
THIS WAS CLEARLY SOME KIND
OF COMPLICATED CODE.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.364
THE BACKWARDS PHRASING WAS LIKE
A COMBINATION OF A ZEN KOAN,

16:37.397 --> 16:41.134
YODA'S CRYPTIC ADVICE, AND ALEX
TREBEK'S QUESTION-ANSWERS.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.870
I DECIDED TO ADOPT
THAT SAME MANNER OF SPEECH

16:43.903 --> 16:45.338
IN ORDER TO HAVE AN AUTHENTIC

16:45.372 --> 16:47.507
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"
EXPERIENCE.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.444
ON RYE TOAST,
B.L.T. ORDERING.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.447
- SAY WHAT?

16:54.481 --> 16:57.984
- UH...MAYONNAISE HAVING,

16:58.085 --> 17:02.089
BUT NOT MUCH TOO, THINK I.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.091
- I'M GONNA GET YOU
A COBB SALAD.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.926
- AH, PRODUCER BATHROOM
IS GOING.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.096
- DID YOU HAVE A STROKE?

17:09.129 --> 17:13.200
- FORREST FINE, I'M FEELING.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.903
- SIRI, STROKE DOCTORS
IN MY AREA.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.571
- ARE YOU EXPERIENCING
ANY MEMORY LOSS?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.607
- FIDDLE I FIT AS I'M FEELING.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.975
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"
WAS PROVING

17:23.009 --> 17:25.412
TO BE A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE
TO REVIEW.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.747
BUT I WAS HOPEFUL THAT AN EXPERT
IN THE HUMAN BRAIN

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
COULD HELP MAKE SENSE OF IT.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.284
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING
SO STRANGELY?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.253
- "THERE ALL IS ACHING."

17:33.286 --> 17:34.787
SENSE MAKE TO YOU?

17:34.821 --> 17:38.291
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- THERE ALL IS ACHING.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.594
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- THERE ALL IS ACHING.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.863
- HMM.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.567
- MY COMMITMENT
TO "THERE ALL IS ACHING"

17:47.600 --> 17:50.670
HAD APPARENTLY MADE ME
A DANGER TO MYSELF AND OTHERS,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.005
AT LEAST IN THE EYES
OF ONE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.

17:53.039 --> 17:56.743
BUT I WAS EAGER TO FOLLOW THIS
EXPERIENCE WHEREVER IT TOOK ME.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.412
[screams]

17:59.446 --> 18:00.980
THERE ALL IS ACHING!

18:01.148 --> 18:02.749
DO NOT UNDERSTAND TOPIC!

18:02.782 --> 18:05.185
NURSE, WHY ARE SMILING?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.419
WHY ARE SMILING, NURSE?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.321
[screams]

18:08.355 --> 18:11.324
[cheerful music]

18:11.358 --> 18:13.025
*

18:13.059 --> 18:17.364
[upbeat music]

18:17.397 --> 18:21.268
HAPPY I AM TO SAY THAT MY TIME
IN MENTAL HOSPITAL

18:21.301 --> 18:23.270
EXTREMELY HELPFUL WAS.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.438
THERE ALL'S ACHING.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.508
ANSWERS CLOSE AT HAND
WERE SEEMING.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.043
- THERE...

18:31.077 --> 18:34.547
ALL'S ACHING.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.451
- THERE ALL'S ACHING.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.355
MET I THERE A MAN
WHO LIKE I TALKED TALKED.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.391
- GEORGIE, GEORGIE.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.393
- FORREST, FORREST.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.960
A MODEL PATIENT, HE WAS.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.263
ANOTHER SEARCHER.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.264
A FRIEND.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.065
THERE ALL'S ACHING.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.734
[laughter]

18:54.767 --> 18:56.236
- [cries]

18:56.269 --> 18:58.971
TOGETHER, SEARCHING
FOR ANSWERS WE WERE.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.774
A LOT IN COMMON WE HAD.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.610
GEORGIE DONE NOTHING!
WHY ALL IS HAPPENING?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.646
WHY ALL IS HAPPENING?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.848
BUT MORE REVIEWING
TO DO THERE WAS.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.818
CALLING MY JOB WAS TO ME.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.321
THERE ALL'S ACHING.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.056
DISTRACTION IS CREATING
ESCAPE PLAN WITH FRIEND.

19:17.089 --> 19:21.861
- [whispering]

19:21.894 --> 19:23.663
- [screaming]

19:23.696 --> 19:26.499
[overlapping shouting]

19:26.533 --> 19:28.668
[glass shatters]

19:28.701 --> 19:31.037
[shouting continues,
alarm blaring]

19:42.048 --> 19:43.750
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:43.783 --> 19:47.420
I'M GONNA KILL MRS. PINNEY NOW,
LIKE YOU ORDERED.

19:47.454 --> 19:52.325
OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH!

19:52.359 --> 19:55.027
- OH.

19:55.061 --> 19:58.531
IN A WAY, MY QUEST TO UNDERSTAND
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"

19:58.565 --> 20:01.033
MIRRORS MANKIND'S SEARCH
FOR MEANING

20:01.067 --> 20:03.370
IN A RANDOM
AND SENSELESS UNIVERSE

20:03.403 --> 20:06.105
THAT TOO OFTEN LEADS US
TO INFLICT HORRORS

20:06.138 --> 20:07.840
UPON ONE ANOTHER.

20:07.874 --> 20:12.011
PERHAPS OUR BEST CHANCE
AS A SPECIES LIES IN REMAINING

20:12.044 --> 20:15.548
DETERMINED ENOUGH
TO FIND MEANING EVERYWHERE.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.717
- I'M S--I'M SORRY.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.254
I HAVE TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
- WHY?

20:21.288 --> 20:24.123
- IT SEEMS THAT WE HAD A GLITCH
IN OUR QUESTION SYSTEM.

20:24.156 --> 20:28.761
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"
IS ACTUALLY NOT THE REVIEW

20:28.795 --> 20:31.030
THAT @BUBBLEBATHS REQUESTED.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.632
- IT ISN'T?
- NO.

20:32.665 --> 20:37.136
SOMEONE ON TWITTER NAMED
"THE REAL LISA CHING" WANTED YOU

20:37.169 --> 20:39.972
TO REVIEW BUBBLE BATHS,
WHICH ARE NICE,

20:40.006 --> 20:41.808
SO THAT WOULD'VE BEEN FUN.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.910
- OH, AND THEY WERE SWITCHED.
- RIGHT, YES.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.212
SWITCHEROO.
WHOOPS.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.547
- WELL, THAT IS A SHAME.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.116
I REALLY DO ENJOY TAKING
A BUBBLE BATH.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.551
- RIGHT, YEAH.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.220
- CERTAINLY A LOT NICER
THAN SHOCK THERAPY.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.755
- OH.
- [chuckles]

20:55.788 --> 20:59.058
- ALL IN ALL, I GIVE
THERE ALL IS ACHING...

20:59.091 --> 21:02.061
- BUBBLE BATHS.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.364
- THREE STARS.

21:13.406 --> 21:17.076
- [crying]
GRANT! GRANT!

21:17.109 --> 21:20.913
THERE'S [bleep] ON MY BODY!

21:20.947 --> 21:22.649
GRANT!

21:22.682 --> 21:24.917
OH, MY GOD.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.919
GRANT!
