WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.757
[theme song playing]

00:57.140 --> 00:59.601
[breathes deeply]

00:59.684 --> 01:02.270
Here she is!

01:02.353 --> 01:04.814
Ten fingers, ten toes.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.192
[baby gurgling]

01:07.275 --> 01:08.943
Do we have a name for her yet?

01:09.402 --> 01:13.448
Elena Maria Alvarez Riera
Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.619
-So that's a yes.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.498
Can't believe they're letting us
take her home.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.708
Last time I changed her diaper,
I left my watch in there.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.171
I know. I heard her butt ticking
and thought it was going to explode.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.340
And then it did!

01:32.425 --> 01:34.594
Since you're recovering from a C-section,

01:34.677 --> 01:36.930
no intercourse for six weeks.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.014
Six weeks?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.766
Six weeks!

01:41.684 --> 01:43.853
I don't know if I could wait six weeks.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.231
Ooh. Yep, I can.
I may never have sex again.

01:48.024 --> 01:48.900
[sighs]

01:53.404 --> 01:56.533
Sorry, I was told
that this room was empty.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.535
This is usually where I come to cry.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.956
Oh, look at your beautiful baby!

02:03.748 --> 02:05.125
Thank you.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.878
They're so great at this age,
before they can talk.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.005
My girls, they're off in college.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.257
That's nice.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.717
Now my wife can yell at me in peace.
[chuckles]

02:15.635 --> 02:16.928
Everything's fine.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.347
Are you one of our doctors?

02:19.430 --> 02:21.975
-If you are, how do we get a new one?
-[Dr. Berkowitz chuckles]

02:23.601 --> 02:25.854
-That's funny.
-[chuckles]

02:25.937 --> 02:29.983
I'm Doctor Leslie Berkowitz.
I'm a GP that works in the building.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.777
But I love coming down
to the maternity ward.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.155
I find it so comforting.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.407
Especially after I've lost a patient.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.160
-Ugh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, don't worry.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.496
He's very much alive. He just hates me.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.167
And now, here come the tears again. I...

02:48.251 --> 02:51.045
I'm just going to find
a broom closet somewhere.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.798
Everything's fine.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.801
[chuckles] Wow.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.638
Yeah, I pity the sorry-ass nurse
that has to work for that guy.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.266
[both laughing]

03:03.349 --> 03:05.685
-All right. You ready to go?
-Wait. What about the car seat?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.604
-I installed it perfectly.
-Okay.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.355
-Your father reinstalled it.
-Of course.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.232
And then your mother
reinstalled it again.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.444
And then they started arguing,
and then they started making out.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.572
When I left, they were salsa dancing
in the parking lot.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.489
[grunts]

03:20.366 --> 03:22.452
You know what we need? A safe word.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.704
For when our parents
start invading our space.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.706
We'll make it military
so they don't understand.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.375
-How about FUBAR?
-Oh!

03:29.459 --> 03:32.670
-My mom'll think it's a Chinese nightclub.
-Yes!

03:32.754 --> 03:34.172
[grunting]

03:34.255 --> 03:37.634
-Oh. Does it hurt?
-A little. It's good.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.593
[exhales sharply]

03:39.636 --> 03:43.139
If this one ever gives me lip,
I'll say, "They sliced me open,

03:43.223 --> 03:46.309
put all my organs on a plate
just to get you out of me, so zip it."

03:48.311 --> 03:52.941
I like this. You're the bad cop.
Which means I'm the good cop.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.073
[sighs] I can't even imagine
making this girl mad at me.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.994
-Don't talk to me!
-Calm down!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.288
-You're totally overreacting.
-Overreacting?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.665
Hey, hey! What's going on here?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.416
He's been lying about having a girlfriend.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.418
[gasps]  Papito's  gay too?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.547
I will be the only woman he's ever loved?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.049
Okay, I'm good.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.929
No. The "P" in his phone was  Papi.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.223
He's been sneaking around and seeing him.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.768
What? Your  papi's  back in the country?
Since when?

04:28.851 --> 04:31.938
About three weeks ago. He has a month off
and he's staying with  Tía.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.731
You've been seeing him without telling me?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.858
It's not as bad as it sounds.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.152
I knew you wouldn't like it,
so I made up a girlfriend,

04:38.236 --> 04:40.196
then met  Papi  in secret
so you wouldn't find out.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.907
No, that's as bad as it sounds.

04:44.450 --> 04:49.330
Papito,  you're making me side with Elena,
and it's very upsetting.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.792
I'm not upset because you saw your father.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.128
You should be able to see your father.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.879
I'm upset because you lied to me.

04:57.797 --> 05:02.051
Papi  said it was easier this way.
You all hate him, so why make trouble?

05:02.135 --> 05:05.888
-This way everybody's happy.
-We are not happy!

05:05.972 --> 05:09.934
I should be smothering you with kisses
right now, but instead I am frowning.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.228
Ay,  my lips are so confused!

05:14.105 --> 05:15.481
I thought you had my back.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.067
You know what he did,
but I guess you're fine with it, huh?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.695
-Elena--
-I will never forgive you for this.

05:22.697 --> 05:26.200
[sighs] What are we supposed to do, Mom?
Ignore him forever?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.039
[speaking Spanish]

05:32.165 --> 05:35.084
I have not spoken to my sister Mirtha
for over 20 years.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.587
What she did was unforgivable!

05:39.422 --> 05:41.341
You don't remember what it was, do you?

05:43.259 --> 05:44.635
She knows what she did.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.601
Mirtha says she returned the  mantilla,
but I know she stole it.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.978
I will never forget this
as long as I live!

05:55.229 --> 05:59.108
Ay, mi vida,  it is a piece of lace.
We will get you a new one.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.820
[sighs]  Pero,  Berto,
this shawl is from Spain!

06:02.904 --> 06:07.075
It belonged to my  abuelita
who stole it from her  abuelita's  sister.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.119
Mi amor.  Put away your anger.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.455
Let's focus
on our beautiful granddaughter,

06:12.538 --> 06:15.792
and enjoy seeing our Lupita
in the glow of motherhood.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.709
[speaks Spanish]

06:16.793 --> 06:18.294
I may have just peed.

06:20.713 --> 06:25.927
Anyway, I'm sorry I was gone so long.
I fell asleep in the lobby. [sighs]

06:27.261 --> 06:32.558
Bueno,  I cannot believe you took Elena
out in public looking like that.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.354
Mami,  for the last time,
a baby does not need earrings.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.774
It is embarrassing!
How will they know it's a girl?

06:39.857 --> 06:43.528
Perhaps the pink bow, pink blanket,
pink cross around her neck...

06:43.611 --> 06:46.072
And the earrings tie it all together!

06:47.115 --> 06:49.575
It only takes two minutes
to pierce one ear.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.204
It takes six minutes to pierce the other
because they know what's coming.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.502
-Get me a piece of ice and a safety pin.
-Papi,  no!

06:59.585 --> 07:03.131
[speaking Spanish]

07:10.471 --> 07:13.516
Wassup?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.979
You guys are Mexican, right?
I recognize the lingo.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.524
Actually, we're Cuban, Sugar Ray.

07:24.694 --> 07:29.282
I love Cuba! I've been there four times.
You guys get back a lot?

07:29.365 --> 07:32.076
No, we were forced to flee our homeland.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.163
Respect.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.790
Who are you? [chuckles]

07:38.541 --> 07:42.003
Schneider, property manager.
Here are your keys.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.130
Now don't get attached,
job's just temporary.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.341
-My father owns the building.
-[all exclaiming in Spanish]

07:48.759 --> 07:52.263
Yeah, I'm just doing him a solid.
I'm really a musician.

07:52.346 --> 07:56.309
Play a lot of rap-rock-ska.
I'm like a male Gwen Stefani.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.145
A Glen Stefani.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.315
How intriguing!

08:02.398 --> 08:05.151
-May I ask, do you speak Spanish?
-Not a word.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.862
Ah. [speaking Spanish]

08:11.866 --> 08:15.495
I'm going to make sure
we got all your boxes from the truck.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.333
[chuckles]

08:21.709 --> 08:24.629
Oh, cool baby! Wow.
How old is the little guy?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.845
-She  is five weeks old...
-[baby crying]

08:32.929 --> 08:36.474
...and awake again. Will someone tell
my precious angel to go to sleep?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.102
I don't know why,

08:40.686 --> 08:44.357
but every time I put a dress on her,
she spits up!

08:47.527 --> 08:48.903
So...

08:50.029 --> 08:51.531
you're a single mom?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.491
Happily married to my husband
who just got out of the army.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.284
Yeah, I'm seeing somebody too.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.579
We both just got out of the army.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.083
My husband is starting up a security
business with some of his buddies.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.460
I'm going back to medical school
to become a doctor.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.837
Why am I telling you all these things?
I'm so tired.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.257
[scoffs] You just had a baby.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.176
Ooh. Word to the wise.
When you're hiring a nanny,

09:12.260 --> 09:15.346
make sure she's not too hot.
That's how I met my fifth mom.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.103
So nice of you to stop by! [chuckles]

09:22.770 --> 09:24.772
-Anyway, okay.
-[mouthing] Okay.

09:24.855 --> 09:30.027
Yeah, hiring a stranger to watch my kid
would bring shame to my people, so...

09:30.111 --> 09:33.781
Okay, but I had four nannies
and look at the results.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.829
I promise you, that  bobo  will never
set foot in this apartment again.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
Ay, Mami, Mami,  is she sleeping?

09:43.332 --> 09:44.208
Yes.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.377
Caballero, por favor,  let me.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.254
Oye, chico,  I got it.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.172
I just got out of the army. I'm strong.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.466
I escaped Cuba. I am stronger.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.515
Yeah, you're both very macho.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.809
Can you put the box of pillows
over there, please?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.898
Hey. I just talked to Brian
and business is heating up.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.318
-Good.
-This cell phone was a great investment.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.195
Plus, I look cool.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.283
Did the nurse say six weeks?
'Cause now it's seven.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.204
Okay, I think we're good.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.582
You guys can head home.

10:24.665 --> 10:28.085
Hey, wait, this box says
"Lydia's clothes" on it.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.670
"Box one of 13"?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.883
It's time to talk. Um...

10:33.966 --> 10:36.385
Your  mami  and I have a proposal.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.054
We're moving in with you.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.680
What?

10:40.264 --> 10:42.933
Mi vida,  you have to put it
in the form of a question

10:43.017 --> 10:44.852
-so they think it's their decision.
-[gasps]

10:44.935 --> 10:46.437
Oh, of course. I am so sorry.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.815
Are we moving in with you? Yes.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.698
It's not enough that we're close by.
You need Double A, 24/7.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.452
-"Double A"?
-Abuelito  and  Abuelita.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.287
[chuckling]

11:05.164 --> 11:06.666
You are so clever.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.750
[speaking Spanish]

11:12.713 --> 11:14.256
FUBAR!

11:15.966 --> 11:19.970
Okay, I mean, we could convert
the dining room into a bedroom.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.472
-Put up a curtain.
-What?

11:21.555 --> 11:23.808
A curtain? Never!

11:24.350 --> 11:27.436
A curtain is just a wall
with no self-respect.

11:32.024 --> 11:36.195
-You can take the bedroom next to ours.
-[laughs] Victor, stop talking!

11:38.823 --> 11:42.368
What are you doing?
They can't move in with us!

11:42.451 --> 11:45.913
And they definitely can't move
into the bedroom next to ours, okay?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.124
They are very affectionate!

11:54.839 --> 11:56.048
Okay...

11:57.007 --> 12:01.137
Look. We said all that before we realized
how hard this was.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.473
I'm opening a business.
You're going to medical school.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.641
Look how tired you are!

12:05.724 --> 12:08.477
I just have my eyes closed
so I don't have to see that.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.023
Hey. What's the big deal? We're Cuban.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.110
Literally everybody we know who has a baby
lives with their parents.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.029
'Cause I just wanted to be the first,
you know?

12:19.113 --> 12:21.615
Like the first Cubans to go to the Moon.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.869
-[chuckles]
-It's never happened before!

12:24.952 --> 12:26.370
[chuckles]

12:26.454 --> 12:30.207
This will help us get on our feet, okay?
It's an investment in our future.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.543
[baby crying]

12:34.670 --> 12:35.671
Okay.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.592
But we are not living with them,
they are living with us.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.178
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.974
Hey, Double A's.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.064
We have decided that
you can move in with us.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.566
A toast.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.322
To you, Victor, my darling Lupita...

13:02.573 --> 13:03.908
my sweet angel Elena.

13:04.783 --> 13:09.663
Truly, today is the first day
of the rest of your lives.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.582
Gracias, Papi.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.167
-Salud.
-Salud.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.086
And I promise
we will stay out of your hair

13:16.170 --> 13:18.464
and we will respect your boundaries.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.424
-Gracias, Mami.
-Mm-hmm.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.425
[coos]

13:22.426 --> 13:24.595
Did you pierce Elena's ears?

13:27.139 --> 13:29.517
[Lydia] She didn't even cry.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.894
She was one tough baby.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.024
-I want to be mad, but she looks so cute.
-Yeah.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.901
[all using baby talk]

13:43.072 --> 13:44.990
-She looks so cute.
-[knocking at door]

13:52.790 --> 13:55.709
Okay, so I'm guessing you've figured out
I've seen Alex a couple of times.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.420
You thought it was okay
to go behind my back and see him?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.756
I'm sure you would have liked it
if I cleared it with you,

14:00.839 --> 14:03.217
but I'm only in town for a little while.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.594
In my defense,
I didn't think I'd get caught.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.180
Victor, cut the crap and explain yourself.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.766
It was just easier this way, okay?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.560
You don't want to see me,
I don't want to see you,

14:12.643 --> 14:13.477
I got to see Alex.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.813
He can't be sneaking around on me.
He's my son.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.690
He's my son too.
I have a right to see him.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.900
You do. You also have
a right to see your daughter.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.944
She's not my biggest fan right now.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.239
-Gee, why do you think that?
-I know what I did. I was mad!

14:25.322 --> 14:28.200
But I told you to keep this gay...
whatever thing between us!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.953
You parade her in front
of my family and friends in a suit?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.746
Come on. You were telling everybody.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.331
[scoffs]

14:35.207 --> 14:39.587
I am not going to explain to you
why all of that is so wrong.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.797
Good. I already heard it from Alex.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.466
Well, good for him.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.262
But even if you still have
issues with me, what?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.890
You're just never gonna talk
to your daughter again?

14:50.973 --> 14:51.891
Of course I will.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.184
When? Because it's been almost a year.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.316
[Victor sighs]

15:02.026 --> 15:03.694
I don't understand what happened.

15:06.822 --> 15:07.948
Back when she was a baby,

15:08.032 --> 15:10.993
I have never seen
a person love someone so much.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.120
[breathes shakily]

15:15.831 --> 15:19.585
[singing in Spanish]

15:25.925 --> 15:28.427
All right. This isn't working out.
How about "Bootylicious"?

15:28.886 --> 15:32.348
Oh, my God, babe.
Have you heard of this thing called sleep?

15:32.431 --> 15:35.100
After you do it, you're not tired.
Big fan. Highly recommend it.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.018
Yeah.

15:36.977 --> 15:41.815
[gasps] And there's coffee too?
I can get used to this.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.611
Buenos días,  Lupe!

15:45.694 --> 15:48.238
-Well, now I don't need the coffee.
-[Lydia laughs]

15:48.322 --> 15:52.368
I just discovered this. It is fantastic.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.161
It makes everything so...

15:55.412 --> 15:57.581
dramatic! [chuckles]

15:58.040 --> 16:00.668
-I'm glad you're happy.
-I'm more than happy, Lupe.

16:00.751 --> 16:04.171
This apartment is heaven.
I will never leave.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.926
I like this thing too.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.719
[baby crying]

16:10.803 --> 16:12.763
Let me get her. She must be hungry.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.350
-Okay.
-[crying stops]

16:18.102 --> 16:19.478
-[Victor] All right, yeah.
-Okay.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.231
I'll get breakfast too.
Although that looks good.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.150
Yeah. I'm real sexy right now.
Get out of here.

16:26.944 --> 16:27.820
Okay,

16:27.903 --> 16:31.907
you eat, while Mommy finds out
where in the world is Matt Lauer.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.786
[Katie Couric]
...from Boston to Los Angeles,

16:35.869 --> 16:37.997
but we're just getting
initial reports of that.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.750
Again, we must tell you
we're trying to get as much information

16:41.834 --> 16:45.212
but it is trickling in
at a very slow pace.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.132
So all of this is unconfirmed.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.927
And, of course, speculation
of a terrorist attack is unconfirmed,

16:52.011 --> 16:55.639
although that is what
some Pentagon officials are saying.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.890
Babe, come here.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.184
-What's wrong?
-Look at what's happening in New York.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.270
[Couric]  Let's go to President Bush.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.315
[President Bush]  Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a difficult moment for America.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.110
I, unfortunately,
will be going back to Washington...

17:08.193 --> 17:10.237
None of us will ever forget this day.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.115
Yet we go forward to defend freedom...

17:13.782 --> 17:17.453
and all that is good and just
in our world.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.583
Thank you, good night,
and God bless America.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.294
[speaking Spanish]

17:29.923 --> 17:32.760
-Lupe, can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.608
I spoke to Brian earlier.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.361
-Does he know anything?
-No, but he's re-enlisting.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.573
Oh.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.496
All right, you can run the business
by yourself.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.665
Lupe, I'm re-enlisting too.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.084
[sighs]

18:05.167 --> 18:06.251
Yeah. I have to.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.176
I get what you're feeling, babe,
and I'm feeling it too,

18:14.927 --> 18:16.470
but we had a plan.

18:17.054 --> 18:21.308
Finish our service, get our careers going,
and then start our family.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.644
I know. That was yesterday.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.523
All the training, and the drills,
and the sacrifice...

18:28.857 --> 18:30.943
That was in case
something like this happens.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.532
-We have a five-week-old daughter.
-Yes, and she is why I'm doing this.

18:37.324 --> 18:42.037
Look, she's so pure,
and innocent, and perfect.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.583
There's no way I'm gonna let her grow up
in a world where that happens.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.085
[sniffling and crying]

18:48.168 --> 18:52.089
If this turns into war, you're infantry.
And then you could--

18:52.172 --> 18:55.676
Baby, baby, baby.
I have a responsibility...

18:56.468 --> 18:59.304
to protect her future and her freedom.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.348
That's what a soldier does.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.519
And that's what a father does. Okay?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.484
Then, I'm going to re-enlist too.

19:12.568 --> 19:16.530
-No, you don't have to do that.
-I know. But I want to.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.576
We'll move back on post somewhere.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.203
It's the best chance
for all of us to be together.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.502
Hopefully,
this doesn't turn into anything.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.632
But you're right.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.552
We need to do this.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.603
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

19:47.686 --> 19:49.188
I don't think I can tell them.

19:51.064 --> 19:54.109
I get it, but they'll understand.

19:55.527 --> 19:59.406
They had parents that had to make
difficult decisions so they could be free.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.534
We're doing the same for Elena.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.204
It's all about her.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.841
Who knows where you and I might be if...

20:19.676 --> 20:21.345
I think about that every day.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.472
[knocking at door]

20:30.062 --> 20:31.313
-Elena.
-Elena...

20:31.396 --> 20:32.439
No. It's my turn.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.739
You know, I've thought a lot
about what happened,

20:40.822 --> 20:47.120
and I'll spare you the details
about the anger, and the crying,

20:47.204 --> 20:48.288
and the weight loss,

20:48.372 --> 20:51.208
and the empty space on my wall
where your picture used to be.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.210
[sighs]

20:53.794 --> 20:57.464
'Cause I've decided that there's no point
in focusing on the negatives.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.427
I'd rather think about the good things
that came from this. Like, um...

21:03.220 --> 21:04.554
[chuckles softly]

21:05.222 --> 21:07.557
You taught me a really valuable lesson.

21:09.935 --> 21:15.190
Just because I'm gay, people will hate me
without knowing anything else about me.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.609
[breathes deeply]

21:18.193 --> 21:20.445
[Elena] I always knew
that was part of the deal.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.116
I just... I never expected it
from my own father.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.411
[chuckles softly]

21:28.495 --> 21:32.207
But now I know
not to expect the best from anyone.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.043
So, thanks, I guess.

21:36.628 --> 21:40.465
Oh, and one more thing. I learned
some really cool stuff about myself.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.262
Like I'm tough. I'm really tough.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.307
And when I do stumble,

21:48.390 --> 21:52.060
I have the most amazing mom
who is always right there to pick me up.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.940
So whatever, dude. I'm moving on
with my life. I'm gonna be fine.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.277
I'm just really bummed out for you.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.946
[sniffles] You're gonna miss stuff.
And that sucks.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.283
'Cause I'm pretty great.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.744
Yeah.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.831
[voice breaking] Yeah, you are.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.713
[whispers] I'm sorry.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.764
[Victor inhales deeply]

22:32.476 --> 22:35.270
-Abuelita,  are there batteries in here?
-Hmm?

22:38.523 --> 22:41.276
What is this? Some kind of shawl?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.320
[gasps]

22:44.321 --> 22:46.406
No! No!

22:46.907 --> 22:52.662
It is not a long-lost  mantilla  from Spain
that nearly ripped the family apart!

22:55.499 --> 22:56.500
I should call Mirtha.

22:58.043 --> 22:58.877
Meh.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.217
-Alex...
-What'd I do now?

23:05.801 --> 23:06.885
Everything.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.139
[breathes deeply] We just saw your  papi.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.768
He said you were trying to mend things
between him and your sister.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.521
Yeah. I guess I did that.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.898
Building bridges.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.778
You know,  Papi  even said
you called him a typical cisgender male.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.448
-I couldn't be more proud.
-[chuckles softly]

23:29.032 --> 23:31.034
So, is everything cool with you guys now?

23:31.118 --> 23:35.455
Mmm... I don't know if we're cool,
but we're talking. That's a start.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.041
Come here. [chuckles]

23:38.125 --> 23:39.543
[Penelope and Elena sigh]

23:40.252 --> 23:42.045
Can everybody stop hugging me?

23:42.129 --> 23:44.881
Sí,  back away.
I haven't had my turn.  Dámelo.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.217
My whole life has been your turn!

23:47.717 --> 23:49.010
[Lydia chuckles]

23:49.094 --> 23:50.762
You better get used to this.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.764
I love you, dumdum!

23:52.848 --> 23:54.558
See, this makes me so happy.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.435
I couldn't stand seeing you
mad at each other.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.353
You've always been so close.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.816
[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

24:02.899 --> 24:04.651
Hey. [gasps]

24:06.236 --> 24:08.196
Meet your new baby brother.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.784
Alejandro Alberto Alvarez
Riera Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.370
I hate him!

24:15.453 --> 24:19.249
I don't want a baby brother!
I want a puppy!

24:23.753 --> 24:26.131
Well, she better get used to it.
We're not getting a puppy.
