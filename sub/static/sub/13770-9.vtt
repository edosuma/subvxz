WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.672
Hey, Dad.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.927
How's it going, Mom?

00:12.095 --> 00:13.514
Howdy.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.849
Three days

00:13.555 --> 00:14.849
and counting.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.099
Too bad

00:14.890 --> 00:16.099
he doesn't have someone

00:16.141 --> 00:18.059
covering the hole

00:16.141 --> 00:18.059
on the other side.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.396
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:27.235 --> 00:28.737
This is  The Crystal Ship.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.072
It's our high school

00:28.779 --> 00:31.072
literary magazine.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
Nobody reads it

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
because it's written

00:32.700 --> 00:34.535
by high school kids

00:32.700 --> 00:34.535
trying to be deep.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.036
And the editor is just some guy

00:36.077 --> 00:37.830
who wants to pad

00:36.077 --> 00:37.830
his college application.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.247
This month, it's me.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.458
Did you get...

00:41.500 --> 00:43.961
"The Mysterious... Forest"?

00:44.003 --> 00:45.253
Yes, Stevie.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.253
I got your drawing.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.088
Is it... in?

00:47.130 --> 00:48.256
Yes. I told you.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.967
Nothing gets rejected.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.011
It doesn't matter

00:50.009 --> 00:52.011
how self-indulgent

00:52.051 --> 00:54.638
or boring or childish

00:52.051 --> 00:54.638
or stupid or painful it is.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.473
If it can be

00:54.680 --> 00:56.473
stapled, it's in.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.017
And why do you care?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.435
Our advisor

00:58.058 --> 01:00.435
doesn't even care.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.815
I have to go.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.025
Um, I need to help

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
Principal Block with...

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
something.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.115
Ronnie and I have

01:14.157 --> 01:16.410
written stories that

01:14.157 --> 01:16.410
we want to submit.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.078
We demand

01:16.451 --> 01:18.078
that you embrace

01:18.119 --> 01:19.830
our vibrant

01:18.119 --> 01:19.830
female voices.

01:19.872 --> 01:23.042
So you better print them, okay?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.459
Okay. You got it.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.132
You are going to read

01:28.255 --> 01:31.132
them first, aren't you?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.928
Yeah, okay.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.848
Oh, my God.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.808
It's been so long,

01:39.850 --> 01:40.935
I didn't think it was possible.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.896
This story is, uh...

01:43.938 --> 01:45.814
is...

01:45.856 --> 01:47.148
What's the word?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.149
Good?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.944
Yes! Ronnie, your story

01:49.985 --> 01:50.945
is fantastic!

01:50.986 --> 01:52.153
I love the ending!

01:52.195 --> 01:53.405
What about mine?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.074
"The Frog Who Was Too

01:53.447 --> 01:55.074
Good for the World"?

01:55.115 --> 01:55.950
It's crap.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.660
Well, maybe

01:55.991 --> 01:58.660
it was over your head.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.161
The frog is you,

01:58.702 --> 02:00.161
the snake is your dad,

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
and the moon is the dope

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
you like on the football team.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.707
Lewis is not a dope.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.250
"Car Crash"?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.044
Yeah. There's this

02:05.292 --> 02:07.044
really pretty girl who,

02:07.086 --> 02:08.295
whenever she walks

02:07.086 --> 02:08.295
down the street,

02:08.336 --> 02:09.504
guys yell filthy stuff

02:08.336 --> 02:09.504
at her,

02:09.546 --> 02:11.131
so she trains herself

02:09.546 --> 02:11.131
to ignore them.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.549
The "pretty" part's

02:11.172 --> 02:12.549
not important.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.426
So, one day, after

02:12.591 --> 02:14.426
she's trained herself,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.136
she's crossing the street,

02:16.177 --> 02:18.179
and this construction worker

02:16.177 --> 02:18.179
yells out, "Hey, lady!"

02:18.221 --> 02:19.180
She doesn't

02:18.221 --> 02:19.180
turn around,

02:19.222 --> 02:20.682
but he's really trying to

02:20.724 --> 02:22.183
warn her there's

02:20.724 --> 02:22.183
a car coming.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.769
She ignores him, and she gets

02:23.811 --> 02:24.979
splattered all over

02:23.811 --> 02:24.979
the pavement!

02:25.020 --> 02:26.772
Men...

02:26.814 --> 02:28.732
are pigs.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.235
Did you hear?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.194
The plant-watering lady

02:33.236 --> 02:34.696
is going to testify

02:33.236 --> 02:34.696
before the S.E.C.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.531
My God! They're

02:34.738 --> 02:36.531
going after everybody.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.700
And the new

02:36.573 --> 02:38.700
supervisor starts today.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.911
She's only here

02:38.742 --> 02:40.911
to make cuts and fire people.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.830
Lots of people.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.707
Oh, my God! Here she comes!

02:47.042 --> 02:48.627
Oh!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.760
Come on! Come on!

02:56.802 --> 02:57.970
Come on!

02:58.012 --> 02:59.138
Come on!

02:59.178 --> 03:00.514
Hal, right?

02:59.178 --> 03:00.514
(yelps)

03:00.555 --> 03:02.141
(microwave bell dings)

03:00.555 --> 03:02.141
Yes!

03:02.181 --> 03:03.308
Nell. We took an extra trip

03:03.350 --> 03:06.227
around the revolving doors

03:03.350 --> 03:06.227
together this morning.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.729
Well, yeah...

03:06.269 --> 03:07.729
Looks like you're

03:07.771 --> 03:09.606
the only one here

03:07.771 --> 03:09.606
who doesn't run away from me.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.817
Well, you can't

03:09.648 --> 03:11.817
run forever, eh?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.485
(both laugh)

03:13.527 --> 03:16.613
Look, I know this whole

03:13.527 --> 03:16.613
situation is awkward,

03:16.655 --> 03:18.532
but I'm going

03:16.655 --> 03:18.532
to do my best

03:18.573 --> 03:20.784
to make everyone here

03:18.573 --> 03:20.784
feel respected.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.327
Thank you, Nell.

03:22.369 --> 03:26.205
Especially the ones

03:22.369 --> 03:26.205
with great-looking hands.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.251
She was touching me

03:27.833 --> 03:30.251
exactly like this!

03:30.293 --> 03:32.963
She was practically drooling

03:30.293 --> 03:32.963
over my sexy hands.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.255
And then, later this morning,

03:34.297 --> 03:36.133
she asked me if I thought

03:34.297 --> 03:36.133
her butt was big.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.259
And it wasn't.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.259
It was perfect!

03:38.301 --> 03:40.846
It wasn't an innocent request

03:38.301 --> 03:40.846
for information, Lois.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.140
If your butt

03:40.888 --> 03:43.140
was as perfect as hers,

03:43.182 --> 03:45.308
believe me, you'd know it!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.061
What am I going to do?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.313
Well, were you mean to her?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.399
No. Why?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
You don't want

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
to antagonize her.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.402
She's the new boss.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.778
She decides who comes

03:55.443 --> 03:56.778
and who goes.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.198
What are you saying?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.282
I am saying

03:59.239 --> 04:01.282
that it wouldn't hurt

04:01.324 --> 04:03.827
for you to be... nice.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.788
That's all. Hal, I'm not

04:03.869 --> 04:06.788
asking you to do anything.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.375
It's just if she

04:06.830 --> 04:10.375
flirts with you again,

04:10.417 --> 04:13.087
just don't

04:10.417 --> 04:13.087
burst her bubble.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.254
Lois!

04:15.047 --> 04:16.631
Oh, all right!

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
You can make me flirt

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
with this beautiful woman,

04:19.300 --> 04:20.844
but you can't make me like it.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.554
I can make you

04:20.886 --> 04:22.554
do anything I want.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.598
You're right.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.266
Go!

04:26.307 --> 04:27.392
(grunting)

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
Ow!

04:32.397 --> 04:33.314
You know why I beat you?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.442
'Cause you outweigh me by,

04:33.356 --> 04:35.442
like, 50 pounds?

04:35.483 --> 04:38.319
No. Because my mind

04:35.483 --> 04:38.319
is stronger than yours.

04:38.361 --> 04:38.904
What?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.321
All your Matrix guys

04:40.363 --> 04:41.573
and your Yodas

04:41.615 --> 04:43.491
and your Karate Kids

04:41.615 --> 04:43.491
do what they do

04:43.533 --> 04:46.327
with their minds,

04:43.533 --> 04:46.327
not their bodies.

04:46.369 --> 04:51.125
I beat you in here before

04:46.369 --> 04:51.125
I ever beat you there.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.334
You're just messing

04:51.166 --> 04:53.334
with me again.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.795
I don't believe you.

04:54.836 --> 04:59.967
You're not sure if

04:54.836 --> 04:59.967
you do or you don't.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.470
This is soil.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.346
Soil is alive.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.808
It is sensitive to the

05:05.388 --> 05:07.808
rhythm of who you truly are.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.144
This is a seed.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.438
Within it lies sleeping

05:10.185 --> 05:13.438
the soul of a plant.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.356
Together, they

05:13.480 --> 05:15.356
make a test.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.068
That was taught to Shaolin

05:15.398 --> 05:18.068
ninjas millions of years ago.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.612
If you can keep

05:18.110 --> 05:20.612
your hand like this

05:20.654 --> 05:23.364
until the seed sprouts,

05:20.654 --> 05:23.364
then you will have developed

05:23.406 --> 05:24.741
the source of all power.

05:24.783 --> 05:25.867
If this is real,

05:25.909 --> 05:27.368
then why are you

05:25.909 --> 05:27.368
teaching it to me?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.746
'Cause I'm a jerk,

05:27.410 --> 05:29.746
and I know you'll fail.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.373
Or maybe...

05:32.415 --> 05:34.417
just once...

05:34.459 --> 05:38.505
I'm letting you in on the

05:34.459 --> 05:38.505
secret of life itself.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.926
What's he doing out there?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.469
I put a rock

05:42.968 --> 05:44.469
in his hand.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.596
He's trying to

05:44.511 --> 05:46.596
make it grow.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.184
Oh, here you

05:47.764 --> 05:50.184
are, Francis.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.059
What's this?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.103
An invitation

05:51.101 --> 05:53.103
for you and Piama.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.481
Otto and I are celebrating

05:53.145 --> 05:56.481
our 25th wedding anniversary!

05:56.523 --> 05:57.732
You're kidding.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.732
That's great.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.525
Oh, I wish

05:58.566 --> 06:00.359
I could chop you up

06:00.401 --> 06:02.070
in a million pieces

06:02.112 --> 06:05.573
so that I could share you

06:02.112 --> 06:05.573
with the rest of the world.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.284
Oh, you are so romantic,

06:07.326 --> 06:10.369
my big Bavarian

06:07.326 --> 06:10.369
monkey face.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.415
Francis, I am in

06:12.539 --> 06:14.415
so much trouble.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.001
What's wrong?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.001
I just found out

06:16.043 --> 06:18.962
what Gretchen is getting

06:16.043 --> 06:18.962
me for our anniversary.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.882
She knows how much

06:19.004 --> 06:21.882
I love cuckoo clocks,

06:21.923 --> 06:23.925
so she called a

06:21.923 --> 06:23.925
factory in Innsbrook

06:23.967 --> 06:27.679
and somehow convinced them

06:23.967 --> 06:27.679
to handcraft a cuckoo clock

06:27.721 --> 06:29.597
with a little Otto

06:27.721 --> 06:29.597
and a little Gretchen

06:29.639 --> 06:32.433
that come out and

06:29.639 --> 06:32.433
kiss every hour.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.311
Wow. What'd you get her?

06:34.353 --> 06:35.520
Some Dustbuster filters

06:35.562 --> 06:37.480
and a bracelet

06:35.562 --> 06:37.480
I saw on QVC.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.359
Whoa. Well...

06:37.522 --> 06:40.359
you have a week.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.319
Is there anything

06:40.399 --> 06:42.319
you know she likes?

06:42.361 --> 06:45.572
Well, she always wished

06:42.361 --> 06:45.572
that I could learn to waltz.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.116
Really? That's great!

06:45.613 --> 06:48.116
I know how to waltz.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.451
I learned in military school

06:48.158 --> 06:50.451
taking girls to cotillions.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.120
I can totally teach you.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.455
Oh, no, no, no, Francis,

06:52.162 --> 06:54.455
I am a terrible dancer.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.917
I tried it at our wedding;

06:54.497 --> 06:56.917
I stepped on her foot.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.211
You can't let

06:56.958 --> 06:59.211
a little thing...

06:56.958 --> 06:59.211
I broke it in three places.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.419
But...

06:59.253 --> 07:00.419
Then I ripped her dress,

07:00.461 --> 07:03.173
and her rear end hung out

07:00.461 --> 07:03.173
for 200 people to see.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.926
Then I got into a

07:03.215 --> 07:05.926
fistfight with her father.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
We spent the night in jail,

07:07.510 --> 07:10.764
and, you know, he always was a

07:07.510 --> 07:10.764
little delicate-looking, and...

07:10.805 --> 07:11.806
Otto, Otto!

07:11.848 --> 07:14.351
I am sure I can teach you

07:11.848 --> 07:14.351
to waltz.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.727
I don't know...

07:15.769 --> 07:17.478
Oh, goodie! Look!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.481
It's the bracelet

07:17.520 --> 07:20.481
I ordered from QVC.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.608
Do you like it?

07:21.649 --> 07:23.443
Yeah, oh, yeah.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.446
I'll meet you

07:23.484 --> 07:26.446
in the barn at 10:00.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.284
What the hell is this?

07:30.325 --> 07:31.368
It's "Car Crash."

07:31.410 --> 07:33.036
It's a story for the

07:31.410 --> 07:33.036
literary magazine.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.079
It's pornography.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.455
How is it pornography?

07:36.497 --> 07:38.417
"The construction worker

07:36.497 --> 07:38.417
yelled out

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
(bleep) my (bleep)."

07:41.253 --> 07:45.506
"(bleep) my (bleep)."

07:45.548 --> 07:46.674
It's supposed

07:45.548 --> 07:46.674
to be offensive.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
That's the whole

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
point of the story.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.594
It's a literary device.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.845
There's nothing literary

07:50.887 --> 07:53.556
about "(bleep)

07:50.887 --> 07:53.556
my (bleep)"!

07:53.598 --> 07:56.517
Parents don't want

07:53.598 --> 07:56.517
their children

07:56.559 --> 07:59.771
reading "(bleep)

07:56.559 --> 07:59.771
my (bleep)."

07:59.813 --> 08:02.690
This school district has

07:59.813 --> 08:02.690
a zero tolerance policy

08:02.732 --> 08:04.109
on "(bleep)

08:02.732 --> 08:04.109
my (bleep)"!

08:04.151 --> 08:06.987
Our forefathers did not

08:04.151 --> 08:06.987
lay down their lives

08:07.028 --> 08:12.117
on San Juan Hill

08:07.028 --> 08:12.117
for "(bleep) my (bleep)"!

08:13.034 --> 08:15.787
Now, you either kill

08:13.034 --> 08:15.787
this story

08:15.829 --> 08:18.790
or replace all the dirty words

08:15.829 --> 08:18.790
with asterisks.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.916
That's just stupid.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.460
What's the point of

08:19.958 --> 08:21.460
bleeping out words?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.919
Everyone knows what

08:21.501 --> 08:22.919
they are anyway.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.546
Besides, Miss Shaw

08:22.961 --> 08:25.546
already said it was okay.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.799
Sometimes, Miss Shaw

08:25.588 --> 08:27.799
doesn't know

08:27.841 --> 08:30.635
when to keep

08:27.841 --> 08:30.635
her mouth shut.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.139
Just do it!

08:34.181 --> 08:36.057
This is censorship!

08:36.099 --> 08:37.142
Call...

08:37.184 --> 08:39.602
the ACLU...

08:39.644 --> 08:42.939
and sue... their ass.

08:42.981 --> 08:43.648
Yes!

08:43.690 --> 08:46.067
We can testify

08:43.690 --> 08:46.067
in poetry!

08:46.109 --> 08:48.611
I'm not going to call

08:46.109 --> 08:48.611
the ACLU for  Crystal Ship.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.156
Just because it's under attack

08:48.653 --> 08:51.156
doesn't mean it's not lame.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.616
What's wrong?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.827
Nothing. It's okay.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.829
It is stupid.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.830
You don't have to get...

08:58.872 --> 09:00.165
Look... you have people

09:00.207 --> 09:02.583
thinking you're smart

09:00.207 --> 09:02.583
and creative all the time.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.878
I just got excited

09:02.625 --> 09:04.878
that people would think that

09:04.919 --> 09:06.587
about me for a change.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.549
Like I said, it's stupid.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
MAN:

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
That is an outrage!

09:13.636 --> 09:15.889
Where is this high school, Iran?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.889
It's okay.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.099
I don't want to do anything;

09:15.930 --> 09:18.099
I just wanted some information.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.100
You want information?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.935
The Constitution exists.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.522
Your teachers might as well take

09:20.977 --> 09:23.522
a leak on the American flag...

09:23.563 --> 09:24.731
which actually is a case

09:23.563 --> 09:24.731
I defended,

09:24.772 --> 09:25.982
but that's not the point.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.608
If these fascists need a lawsuit

09:26.024 --> 09:27.608
to wake them up,

09:27.650 --> 09:30.611
then... Malcolm,

09:27.650 --> 09:30.611
what's the name of your school?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.073
My school?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.073
It doesn't have a name...

09:33.114 --> 09:34.741
and I'm not really

09:33.114 --> 09:34.741
a student there.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.617
I was just prank calling you.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.578
Ha, ha. Fooled you.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.914
That guy was nuts-- I didn't

09:38.619 --> 09:40.914
want anything to do with him.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.375
I hung up before he could figure

09:40.955 --> 09:43.375
out where I was calling from.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.961
Unless... he has...

09:47.003 --> 09:48.963
Caller I.D.

09:49.005 --> 09:52.551
BLOCK (over megaphone):

09:49.005 --> 09:52.551
Attention, students.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.719
Attention, students.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.638
As you know, we publish

09:54.761 --> 09:57.638
a literary magazine

09:57.680 --> 09:59.724
called  The Crystal Ship.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.935
(students murmuring)

10:01.976 --> 10:04.104
Well, we do.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.232
This morning, I received word

10:04.145 --> 10:07.232
that the ACLU

10:07.274 --> 10:10.651
has filed a lawsuit

10:07.274 --> 10:10.651
to force us to publish

10:10.693 --> 10:13.988
an extraordinarily

10:10.693 --> 10:13.988
obscene essay.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.615
(scattered applause)

10:16.866 --> 10:20.912
The school district's lawyers

10:16.866 --> 10:20.912
have given us a choice.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.663
We can either turn

10:20.954 --> 10:22.663
our high school

10:22.705 --> 10:25.666
into an adult bookstore, or

10:25.708 --> 10:29.879
we can cancel

10:25.708 --> 10:29.879
all extracurricular activities.

10:29.921 --> 10:36.136
Therefore, the football team

10:29.921 --> 10:36.136
is hereby canceled.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.222
The debate team

10:36.428 --> 10:39.222
is hereby canceled.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.682
The drama club, canceled.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.269
The glee club, canceled.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.854
The prom, canceled.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.523
GIRL (sobbing):

10:46.896 --> 10:48.523
No!

10:49.566 --> 10:53.111
If any of you wish to find

10:49.566 --> 10:53.111
the student editor, Malcolm,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.696
and thank him for

10:53.153 --> 10:55.696
this, you'll find

10:55.738 --> 10:58.908
his class schedule posted

10:55.738 --> 10:58.908
outside my office.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.251
(faint squeaking)

11:17.344 --> 11:19.179
OTTO:

11:17.344 --> 11:19.179
You are terrible!

11:19.220 --> 11:23.350
You have completely wasted four

11:19.220 --> 11:23.350
entire days of waltz lessons.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.976
It makes me sick

11:25.018 --> 11:26.353
to look at you.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.937
Otto, this isn't helping.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.105
Every time

11:27.979 --> 11:29.105
you punch yourself,

11:29.147 --> 11:31.732
we lose hours

11:29.147 --> 11:31.732
of valuable practice time.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.527
You just...

11:31.774 --> 11:33.527
you got to relax.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.446
How can I relax when Gretchen

11:33.568 --> 11:36.446
is depending on me?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.114
You do not learn by relaxing.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.366
You learn

11:38.156 --> 11:39.366
by violently

11:39.407 --> 11:41.409
assaulting your problem

11:41.451 --> 11:44.162
until it surrenders

11:41.451 --> 11:44.162
its mysteries to you!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.747
I just feel like

11:44.204 --> 11:46.747
you're psyching yourself out.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.542
Why don't you take five

11:46.789 --> 11:48.542
and clear your head?

11:48.583 --> 11:49.750
You take five.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.751
I shall study

11:50.793 --> 11:53.004
the videotape

11:50.793 --> 11:53.004
of our previous lessons.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.840
I will correct the problems

11:53.046 --> 11:55.840
in my technique.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.720
(yells in pain)

12:09.020 --> 12:11.147
(screaming)

12:11.189 --> 12:12.691
(loud clattering)

12:12.731 --> 12:15.860
Mm-hmm, perhaps more

12:12.731 --> 12:15.860
weight on my left instep.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.406
Otto, stop!

12:15.902 --> 12:19.406
Just stop all of this.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.282
This isn't work!

12:21.324 --> 12:22.783
This isn't science!

12:22.825 --> 12:24.411
This is dancing!

12:24.452 --> 12:25.786
Stop thinking.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.372
Stop watching tapes.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.790
And take off the waltz-trainer!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.962
♪ ♪

12:35.004 --> 12:36.381
Feel the music.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.798
Look into my eyes.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
But I...

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
Shh!

12:38.883 --> 12:39.800
But Gretchen...

12:39.842 --> 12:41.010
Shh.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.221
Forget Gretchen.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.223
Forget the past

12:43.263 --> 12:45.223
and its failures,

12:45.265 --> 12:46.391
the future

12:46.433 --> 12:47.684
and its hopes.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.519
The world is gone.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.813
Right now all that exists

12:49.561 --> 12:52.813
is you...

12:53.732 --> 12:54.815
...and me

12:54.857 --> 12:56.651
and the waltz.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.797
Hey, Hal.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.344
Tough day.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.344
My neck is so stiff.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.686
Mmm!

13:31.728 --> 13:35.565
So... what's a guy like

13:31.728 --> 13:35.565
you do for fun, huh?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.857
I didn't know what to say.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.485
I don't do anything for fun.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.111
Don't tell me you just stood

13:38.526 --> 13:40.111
there for ten minutes

13:40.153 --> 13:41.028
with your mouth hanging open?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.363
She wasn't even

13:41.070 --> 13:42.363
listening, Lois.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.073
She was too busy

13:42.405 --> 13:44.073
mentally stripping me

13:44.115 --> 13:45.325
and dressing me in leather.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.869
Boys, get out here.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.869
Dinner.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.455
How long is this

13:48.911 --> 13:50.455
going to take?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.872
I had to have

13:50.497 --> 13:51.872
Billy Hawkins

13:51.914 --> 13:53.333
help dress me for gym.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.834
It'll grow when you stop

13:53.374 --> 13:55.834
needing  it to grow.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.505
Malcolm,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.505
where've you been?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.131
Captain of the football team

13:58.546 --> 14:00.131
wanted to show me

14:00.173 --> 14:01.882
how he decorated the inside

14:00.173 --> 14:01.882
of his locker.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.926
Yes, well, the principal

14:01.924 --> 14:03.926
of your school called.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.887
He said you filed a lawsuit

14:03.968 --> 14:06.887
so you could destroy the school.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.055
That's a total lie.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.184
All I'm trying to do is publish

14:08.097 --> 14:11.184
a magazine full of dirty words.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.311
Oh, and that's supposed

14:11.225 --> 14:13.311
to make me feel better?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.354
I didn't even start this.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.896
But everybody's

14:14.395 --> 14:15.896
fighting me so hard,

14:15.938 --> 14:17.898
it makes me think

14:15.938 --> 14:17.898
I can't just back down.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.899
You always said

14:18.941 --> 14:20.109
there are principles

14:18.941 --> 14:20.109
you can't ever give up,

14:20.151 --> 14:21.486
no matter what people do to you.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.903
And I'm as

14:21.528 --> 14:22.903
surprised as anyone,

14:22.945 --> 14:24.739
but I think that's

14:22.945 --> 14:24.739
what I'm doing.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.783
What's her name?

14:26.825 --> 14:27.784
Who?

14:27.826 --> 14:29.076
The girl

14:27.826 --> 14:29.076
you're trying to impress.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.286
Hope she's cute.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.121
This isn't

14:30.328 --> 14:32.121
about a girl.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.998
A girl wrote

14:32.163 --> 14:33.998
the dirty story.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.333
Oh, son, you want to be careful.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.376
A girl who writes dirty stories

14:36.417 --> 14:37.711
sounds a little advanced

14:36.417 --> 14:37.711
for you.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.546
That's not what this is about.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.672
Ronnie's a lesbian.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.922
Well, maybe she

14:40.714 --> 14:41.922
wouldn't be a lesbian

14:41.964 --> 14:43.883
if you tucked in your

14:41.964 --> 14:43.883
shirt once in awhile.

14:44.967 --> 14:45.926
I'm just trying

14:45.968 --> 14:46.927
to help her.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.596
She doesn't deserve this.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.431
She went to all the trouble

14:48.638 --> 14:50.431
to express something

14:50.473 --> 14:52.809
in a way that's actually good,

14:50.473 --> 14:52.809
and now she's being silenced

14:52.851 --> 14:55.520
by a bunch of stupid,

14:52.851 --> 14:55.520
arbitrary people

14:55.562 --> 14:57.522
for stupid, arbitrary reasons.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.023
And I think that's just wrong.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.941
Son, you don't want

14:59.065 --> 15:00.941
to come on that strong.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.444
That might be what turned

15:00.983 --> 15:03.444
her gay in the first place.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.324
Come in.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.909
You wanted to see me...

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
What's going on?

15:14.288 --> 15:15.623
Malcolm,

15:14.288 --> 15:15.623
the teachers and I

15:15.665 --> 15:16.875
are not here to blame.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.835
We're looking for a solution.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.002
This is Mr. Mellon.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
He's legal counsel

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
for the district.

15:22.004 --> 15:22.963
It's nice to meet you.

15:23.005 --> 15:27.385
Now if it were up to me,

15:23.005 --> 15:27.385
you'd just be expelled,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.846
but the district thinks

15:27.427 --> 15:29.846
that there's a way

15:29.888 --> 15:31.347
to get everything

15:29.888 --> 15:31.347
back the way it was.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.391
Good. Cause I never

15:31.389 --> 15:33.391
wanted to fight everyone.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.226
Of course you didn't.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.813
Basically, son,

15:36.310 --> 15:38.813
you sign this letter.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.566
It says "Car Crash" never met

15:38.855 --> 15:41.566
the standards of  Crystal Ship.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.984
You just picked it to see what

15:41.608 --> 15:43.984
you could get away with.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.985
It was an

15:44.026 --> 15:44.985
adolescent prank,

15:45.027 --> 15:46.362
and you apologize.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.697
Now just sign this,

15:47.739 --> 15:50.199
and everyone

15:47.739 --> 15:50.199
gets their clubs back.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.076
I'm not going to sign it.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.578
This is just a lie.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.789
All right, Malcolm, I wasn't

15:53.620 --> 15:55.789
going to mention this,

15:55.830 --> 15:59.667
but I made cupcakes for you kids

15:55.830 --> 15:59.667
every week.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.588
Look, I'm not the only one

16:00.960 --> 16:03.588
affected by this.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
I agree.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
Ronnie?

16:10.136 --> 16:13.473
I'd like you to sign it,

16:10.136 --> 16:13.473
Malcolm.

16:15.433 --> 16:19.145
I just want field hockey back.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.652
Hello, there, Nell.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.945
Your eyes

16:26.986 --> 16:28.738
are very pretty.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.738
Really?

16:28.780 --> 16:31.866
You like my eyes?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.117
No!

16:33.159 --> 16:35.035
I was just told to say that.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.287
I'm sure you're very pretty,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.623
but I don't find you even

16:36.329 --> 16:38.623
remotely attractive.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.208
I'm only flirting with you

16:38.665 --> 16:41.208
because my wife is making me!

16:41.250 --> 16:42.335
Wait a minute.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.544
I was flirting with  you,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.130
and the first thing you

16:43.586 --> 16:46.130
did was tell your wife?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.632
I tell her everything.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.301
And she told you

16:47.674 --> 16:50.301
to flirt back with me?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.719
Yeah.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.346
Just out of curiosity,

16:53.387 --> 16:56.933
how far was your wife

16:53.387 --> 16:56.933
willing to take this?

16:56.975 --> 16:59.352
She wouldn't tell me.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.146
Hal, it's okay. Calm down.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.439
Now, the first thing

17:03.481 --> 17:06.651
you need to know is,

17:03.481 --> 17:06.651
I'm not going to fire you.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.068
You're not?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.068
No.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.696
I was going to,

17:09.737 --> 17:10.738
but then Grossman and Ball

17:10.780 --> 17:12.072
got indicted,

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
and you're the only one

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
left in the department.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.701
Oh.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.701
I'm really glad

17:14.742 --> 17:16.703
it worked out this

17:14.742 --> 17:16.703
way for you, Hal.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.371
Thank you. Thank you.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.540
Lois will be so relieved.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.083
Well... we don't want her

17:23.125 --> 17:25.211
to be too relieved.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.383
It's hardly noticeable.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.676
(loudly):

17:30.424 --> 17:31.676
Good.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.093
We can finish going over

17:31.718 --> 17:33.093
your progress reports

17:33.135 --> 17:35.137
in my office this afternoon.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.890
I'm on fire.

17:36.931 --> 17:37.974
(clears throat)

17:38.016 --> 17:40.100
Ah. Malcolm.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.979
So, have you, uh,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.979
made a decision yet?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.313
Yes. I want the clubs back.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.523
So I signed the letter

17:45.565 --> 17:46.524
and sent it

17:45.565 --> 17:46.524
to your lawyer.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.567
I even made copies.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.569
Yeah, what's all

17:47.608 --> 17:49.569
this other stuff?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.278
I put the letter

17:49.610 --> 17:51.278
on the back cover

17:51.320 --> 17:52.530
of my new  independent

17:52.572 --> 17:53.740
literary magazine.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.366
We made 700 copies,

17:53.781 --> 17:55.366
and we're distributing it

17:55.408 --> 17:57.827
20 feet outside

17:55.408 --> 17:57.827

17:57.869 --> 17:59.078
as required by law.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.043
It's called

18:02.456 --> 18:05.043
"Absolutely Filthy Smut."

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
It's a catchy title.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
People seem interested.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.139
Man, from now on

18:19.181 --> 18:20.433
I'm going to ask

18:19.181 --> 18:20.433

18:24.979 --> 18:25.813
You know, I kind of wish

18:25.855 --> 18:27.189
I did put some

18:25.855 --> 18:27.189
smut in it, though.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.315
People are gonna

18:27.231 --> 18:28.315
be disappointed.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.818
Don't be... so sure.
