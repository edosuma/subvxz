WEBVTT

00:11.779 --> 00:13.879
(turns engine off)

00:21.555 --> 00:24.156
sorry, mate. I gotta.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.233
Here you are, son.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.572
(sighs)

00:49.550 --> 00:51.216
so, how long have you
been here, then?

00:51.318 --> 00:54.386
Shit...16 years!

00:54.488 --> 00:57.222
-Yeah? That long?
-Yeah, it's been a while.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.557
Where are you living?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.559
I'm with ray.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.296
He fixed up his garage,
so I'm in there.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.965
-Is it comfy?
-Yeah.

01:07.068 --> 01:10.035
Gets a bit hotter
and colder sometimes.

01:10.137 --> 01:13.806
'cause I don't think
it's insulated, but, you know.

01:13.908 --> 01:17.142
I've got my own space.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.746
And I get to see a bit more
of ray's daughter.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.816
-He's got a daughter?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.818
Brit...Brittany.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.087
How old is she?

01:28.189 --> 01:30.122
Nine.

01:32.927 --> 01:33.926
How is ray?

01:34.028 --> 01:35.961
(mutters) yeah, good.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.467
He's...He's good.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.380
Brucey needs ya.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.134
What's going on?

02:16.537 --> 02:19.371
-I'm stuck.
-What do you mean?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.107
In the fucking chair.
I can't get out of it.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.543
Don't shake your bloody head
at me.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.677
It's not my fault.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.616
Alright. Grab his arm, will you?

02:30.718 --> 02:31.884
Under the armpit.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.920
Alright, count of three.
One, two, three.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.762
Bruce: Thank fuck for that.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.466
Thought I was gonna die
in the fucking thing.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.634
Yeah. If only.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.768
Yeah, get stuffed.

02:53.207 --> 02:57.309
-Alright? Steady?
-Alright. Yeah.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.978
-Ok. Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.147
I'll see you again soon, eh?
Hopefully.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.183
-Good to see ya.
-Love ya.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.088
Yeah, love you.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.758
Come on.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.269
Dad: See you soon.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.289
(hip-hop music plays)

03:49.530 --> 03:51.530
need a favour, big fella.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.334
Mate of mine.
You heard of kate hall?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.102
Kate hall.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.671
She's a journo at the 'herald'.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.607
She covers their crime stuff.

04:01.709 --> 04:05.611
She's writing a book.
Like, a true crime book.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.280
And she's looking for stories.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.849
Wondering if you might wanna
have a chat with her.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.252
What's in it for me?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.886
You'd be doing me a favour.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.092
Come on, mate.
It's an old mate's daughter.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.761
He's done a couple of favours
for me over the years,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.229
it'd be good to return
the favour.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.200
Nuh.

04:28.302 --> 04:32.537
Mate, come on. I'm asking
a favour as a friend here.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.307
No.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.174
Thanks.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.214
You know what? I wasn't
gonna mention this, but...

04:42.316 --> 04:44.449
..Do you have any idea

04:44.551 --> 04:46.618
what you put me through
with that davros shit?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.719
What?

04:47.821 --> 04:50.122
The davros bullshit.

04:50.224 --> 04:52.691
You know that was my
son-in-law's brother, right?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.926
Do you know the trouble
that shit caused me?

04:55.029 --> 04:56.662
He tried to fucking kill me.

04:56.764 --> 05:00.565
I know that, but I had...

05:00.668 --> 05:03.468
My son-in-law, he didn't
speak to me for six months.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.070
Caused heaps of friction,
alright?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.072
Well, it's not my fuckin' fault!

05:07.174 --> 05:09.908
You asked me to sit down
with the guy and I did.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.411
I know you did, mate, and
I appreciate that, but shit!

05:12.513 --> 05:15.347
Not like I ask you
for heaps of favours, you know?

05:25.909 --> 05:26.608
Nock at door)

05:37.921 --> 05:39.821
-hi.
-How you going?

05:39.923 --> 05:41.757
-I'm kate.
-Nice to meet you.

05:41.859 --> 05:43.892
-In case you were wondering.
-(chuckles)

05:43.994 --> 05:46.061
uh, come through.

05:46.163 --> 05:47.996
Ray: Nice house.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.631
Thanks! Yeah.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.567
-I like the old joints.
-Yeah, me too.

05:52.669 --> 05:53.802
They've got more character
than new houses.

05:53.904 --> 05:56.405
-Yeah.
-Uh, hey, do you want a drink?

05:56.507 --> 05:58.807
Do you want a beer,
a glass of water or something?

05:58.909 --> 06:00.008
Ray: Wouldn't mind a cup of tea.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.911
Ok, sure. What kind?

06:03.013 --> 06:04.379
-Have you got any earl grey?
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:09.686 --> 06:10.919
So, where'd you grow up?

06:11.021 --> 06:13.688
About four hours out of sydney.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.158
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, on a farm.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.759
Mmm! Do you mind
my asking where?

06:17.861 --> 06:19.895
I don't mind you asking.

06:21.432 --> 06:23.932
Right. Um, what kind of
farm was it?

06:24.034 --> 06:26.668
-Just a dairy farm.
-Right.

06:26.770 --> 06:29.237
Did you have a happy childhood?

06:30.507 --> 06:31.540
It was alright.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.678
Did you wanna elaborate maybe
a bit on that?

06:38.382 --> 06:39.281
So, what's your book about?

06:39.383 --> 06:42.084
Criminals, pretty much.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.454
Yeah, I mean, I've interviewed
a few people so far

06:45.556 --> 06:47.689
and it's just people
telling their stories.

06:47.791 --> 06:48.990
Mmm.

06:52.963 --> 06:55.263
Look, I understand if you're
a little bit cagey about this,

06:55.365 --> 06:56.531
and I totally get it.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.533
But, um...

06:58.635 --> 07:00.435
..I just want you to know that

07:00.537 --> 07:02.871
nothing's gonna go in the book
unless you're happy with it,

07:02.973 --> 07:04.673
so I just want you to, you know,
feel comfortable to talk to me.

07:10.247 --> 07:11.680
Alright.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.952
Cool. Um, do you mind
if I record?

07:19.490 --> 07:21.056
No, it's alright.

07:21.158 --> 07:22.057
-Sure?
-Mmm.

07:22.159 --> 07:23.358
Ok.

07:28.999 --> 07:31.466
I'll just put that there.

07:31.568 --> 07:34.169
So maybe, I don't know,
do you wanna start with

07:34.271 --> 07:35.871
about how you got into it -
your first job, maybe?

07:37.841 --> 07:39.241
When you say 'job',
what do you mean?

07:39.343 --> 07:41.576
-What do you mean, 'job'?
-Well, your first...

07:41.678 --> 07:42.844
I don't know, hit. I mean...

07:42.946 --> 07:45.347
Who told you I do hits?

07:45.449 --> 07:47.682
Well, that's what freddy
told me, that you'd...

07:47.784 --> 07:50.185
..Talk about that a little bit.

07:52.823 --> 07:54.556
I mean, sorry, I might have
misunderstood that.

07:54.658 --> 07:57.159
I didn't realise that...
That's just what freddy said.

07:57.261 --> 07:58.960
(ray clears his throat)

08:04.101 --> 08:05.433
and that's kinda
why I got you here,

08:05.536 --> 08:07.802
'cause that's the sort of stuff
I wanna talk about in the book.

08:19.049 --> 08:21.583
(indistinct p.A. Announcement)

08:21.685 --> 08:22.851
'moist'.

08:22.953 --> 08:24.853
Ray: Yeah, that's a good one.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.421
Moist.

08:26.523 --> 08:28.423
-Mmm.
-That's a good one.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.759
Yeah. My grandmother,
when I was a kid,

08:30.861 --> 08:32.928
she used to make this teacake,

08:33.030 --> 08:34.596
and that was really moist.

08:34.698 --> 08:36.097
(laughs)

08:36.200 --> 08:38.934
she used to put cinnamon
on the top of it.

08:39.036 --> 08:40.535
-Mmm?
-Yeah. Lovely. Lovely.

08:40.637 --> 08:42.938
Ok. Teacake.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.539
-Teacake.
-Right.

08:44.641 --> 08:45.774
'appendectomy'.

08:45.876 --> 08:49.945
-'appendectomy'?
-Yeah.

08:50.047 --> 08:52.113
Appendectomy. Appendectomy.
What's that?

08:52.216 --> 08:54.115
You don't know
what appendectomy is?

08:54.218 --> 08:55.183
No.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.551
It's where they take
your bloody appendix out.

08:56.653 --> 08:57.786
Take your appendix out.
No, I knew that.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.288
Yeah, sure you did. Yeah.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.757
'panties'.

09:04.494 --> 09:06.394
(gruffly) 'panties'?

09:06.496 --> 09:08.797
Not when you say it.
Like, when a chick says it.

09:08.899 --> 09:10.565
When she says, like,
"oh, take off my panties!"

09:10.667 --> 09:11.766
(sighs)

09:14.671 --> 09:17.305
that's a good word.
Moist panties.

09:17.407 --> 09:19.307
-Moist panties?
-Yeah.

09:19.409 --> 09:20.308
You've outdone yourself,
haven't you?

09:20.410 --> 09:22.310
Thank you very much.

09:22.412 --> 09:24.312
Put two of your favourite words
together in a sentence.

09:24.414 --> 09:25.380
-Yeah, well, you know...
-Very good.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.315
-Quite the wordsmith.
-Yeah. Yeah, you are.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.184
-What do you reckon?
-Yeah, nah. I like it.

09:49.506 --> 09:49.871
Feel that.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.475
Shit. Sharp!

09:56.213 --> 09:57.012
Mmm.

09:57.114 --> 10:00.015
Gary: And it was
good calamari, mate.

10:00.117 --> 10:02.784
Like, fresh. Fresh as.
Not the frozen shit.

10:02.886 --> 10:05.854
You know, the shit you get
from the fishmongers.

10:05.956 --> 10:08.356
But what happened was is that
when I put it in the fridge,

10:08.458 --> 10:09.791
I've left it in the bag
that I've bought it in.

10:09.893 --> 10:11.626
Yeah.

10:11.728 --> 10:14.296
So when I've gone to cook it,

10:14.398 --> 10:16.965
it's been in there
for a couple of days

10:17.067 --> 10:18.199
and I've taken it out.

10:18.302 --> 10:20.302
-Fuck it stunk.
-Yeah.

10:20.404 --> 10:22.637
Just rank.

10:22.739 --> 10:24.706
It's just gone
all through the house.

10:24.808 --> 10:27.042
What I shoulda done,
when I bought it,

10:27.144 --> 10:29.277
if I was gonna leave it
in there for a couple of days,

10:29.379 --> 10:32.113
I should have tipped it out,
washed it thoroughly,

10:32.215 --> 10:35.283
put it in a fresh plastic bag,
a new plastic bag,

10:35.385 --> 10:38.553
then whacked it in the fridge
and then, you know,

10:38.655 --> 10:40.221
probably would have had a chance

10:40.324 --> 10:41.956
at lasting a couple more days,
you know?

10:42.059 --> 10:44.893
But it stewed in its own juices

10:44.995 --> 10:47.962
and its own filth, you know?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.365
So...So it went off
and I had to chuck it out,

10:50.467 --> 10:53.034
and it was, like, a kilo of the
shit which, you know, bummed me.

10:53.136 --> 10:54.135
Ray: Mmm.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.404
But what really bummed me

10:56.506 --> 10:59.441
is I was watching
one of those nature docos

10:59.543 --> 11:02.444
and they had a bit on octopuses

11:02.546 --> 11:04.979
and, like, their life cycle
and shit.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.649
And I didn't know this, but...

11:07.751 --> 11:10.085
Do you know how octopuses
have babies?

11:10.187 --> 11:11.786
Mm-mm.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.591
The female octopus

11:16.693 --> 11:17.759
gets pregnant, right?

11:17.861 --> 11:19.761
Obviously.

11:19.863 --> 11:23.998
And she lays eggs
underneath a rock, right?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.067
And then she guards it.

11:26.169 --> 11:29.571
Doesn't eat, doesn't sleep,

11:29.673 --> 11:33.241
and just moves her tentacles
over the eggs.

11:33.343 --> 11:34.743
Ray: Mmm.

11:34.845 --> 11:37.679
For months and months
and months, right?

11:37.781 --> 11:41.916
And just as the eggs hatch,

11:42.018 --> 11:43.051
you know what happens?

11:46.123 --> 11:48.156
She dies?

11:49.259 --> 11:51.092
-She dies.
-Mmm.

11:51.194 --> 11:52.794
Mmm.

11:55.031 --> 11:56.664
So I won't be eating calamari
anymore.

11:56.767 --> 11:58.900
Ray: Mmm.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.708
Calamari's squid, isn't it?

12:06.810 --> 12:08.176
What?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.846
No.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.249
-Yeah.
-Hold on.

12:14.351 --> 12:17.352
Yeah, calamari's squid, mate,
not octopus.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.289
So I can eat calamari?

12:21.391 --> 12:22.524
Go for it.

12:26.396 --> 12:27.429
Huh!

12:29.299 --> 12:30.231
Gary: Alright, then.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.368
How many steel-framed
buildings in history

12:33.470 --> 12:35.770
have collapsed due to fire?

12:37.641 --> 12:40.842
-I don't know.
-Three, all on 9/11.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.213
-Two.
-No, three.

12:45.315 --> 12:47.482
You got the twin towers,

12:47.584 --> 12:50.118
and there was a third building.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.954
Two were hit by a plane,
one wasn't hit by a plane.

12:53.056 --> 12:56.224
That's building 7, a couple of
hundred metres down the road.

12:56.326 --> 12:58.893
And that fell a few hours later
in under five seconds.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.162
And they say it collapsed

13:01.264 --> 13:04.566
because it got hit from debris
from the twin towers

13:04.668 --> 13:06.501
and then it started a fire

13:06.603 --> 13:07.669
and that's what caused it
to fall.

13:07.771 --> 13:09.671
But controlled
demolition experts

13:09.773 --> 13:10.805
say it was
a controlled demolition.

13:12.943 --> 13:15.009
-Got your radio on?
-Yeah.

13:15.111 --> 13:18.379
-Alright. See you in a bit.
-Alright.

13:22.686 --> 13:23.718
Watch out for snakes!

13:28.124 --> 13:29.157
(slurps)

13:33.180 --> 13:35.113
(crickets chirp softly)

15:11.077 --> 15:12.543
(aeroplane roars far above)

15:16.917 --> 15:19.884
(road vehicle approaches)

15:42.442 --> 15:43.308
(engine stops)

16:16.843 --> 16:19.644
(people chatter indistinctly)

16:40.266 --> 16:41.165
(urine splashing)

16:50.377 --> 16:53.544
(birdsong)

16:53.646 --> 16:55.079
man: Yeah, I know, I...

16:57.050 --> 16:58.082
C'mon, girl!

17:05.158 --> 17:06.958
(vinnie whistles)
go on, get up!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.336
No, leave that.
Come on, let's go.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.871
-Come on, girl.
-(dog barks)

18:00.113 --> 18:01.412
come on, girl. (whistles)
round the back. Round the back.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.914
-Come on!
-(dog barks)

18:03.016 --> 18:04.048
leave that.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.320
(dog barks)

18:40.887 --> 18:41.953
-(door bangs)
-man: Vinnie!

18:42.055 --> 18:44.956
Vinnie!

18:45.058 --> 18:46.257
-What?
-Run!

18:49.062 --> 18:50.428
(dog barks)

18:55.235 --> 18:57.034
(gunshots ring out nearby)

18:57.137 --> 18:58.636
gary: Oh, shit!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.171
-Get him! Fuckin' get him!
-(dog barks)

19:03.643 --> 19:05.143
(dog snarls)

19:05.245 --> 19:06.344
(dog whimpers)

19:10.917 --> 19:12.450
hey, I'm on my way.
(starts car) fuck.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.624
(gunshot)

19:20.860 --> 19:22.393
(gunshot)

19:32.205 --> 19:33.471
go! Go, go, go, go, go!

19:36.276 --> 19:36.941
-(gunshot)
-fuck!

19:37.043 --> 19:39.177
Are you hit?

19:39.279 --> 19:42.180
-Nah, I'm good.
-How'd you go?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.481
Uh, not too good.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.229
Gary: Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.900
(gary starts car)

20:03.970 --> 20:05.236
ray: Go.

20:14.163 --> 20:15.463
(ray reads)
"and so jack went outside

20:15.565 --> 20:17.465
"and started
to climb the beanstalk.

20:17.567 --> 20:20.034
"he climbed up to the sky
through the clouds

20:20.136 --> 20:23.037
"and saw a beautiful castle."

20:23.139 --> 20:24.372
how could he climb
to the clouds?

20:24.474 --> 20:27.875
Uh, he must have been
really fit.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.878
"so he saw the castle
and went inside."

20:30.980 --> 20:33.014
why did he go inside?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.484
Well, it was
a nice-looking castle

20:36.586 --> 20:37.718
and he just wanted
to check it out.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.720
But that's not right.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.722
You can't just go inside other
people's castles like that.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.359
Yeah, look, I think you might
be a bit old for this story.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.360
Do you wanna read
something else?

20:46.462 --> 20:49.030
No, keep going. I like it.

20:49.132 --> 20:53.301
Ok. "so jack heard a voice.
'fi, fi, fo, fum!'

20:53.403 --> 20:56.637
"jack ran into a cupboard
to hide

20:56.739 --> 21:00.308
"just as an enormous giant came
into the room and sat down.

21:00.410 --> 21:03.978
"on the table, there was a hen
and golden harp.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.646
"'lay!' said the giant.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.882
"the hen laid an egg.
It was made...

21:07.984 --> 21:10.484
"..Of gold.

21:10.587 --> 21:11.819
"'sing!' said the giant.

21:11.921 --> 21:14.922
"the harp began to sing.
Soon the giant fell asleep.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.591
"so jack jumped
out of the cupboard.

21:16.693 --> 21:20.161
"he took the hen and the harp
and he ran for the door."

21:20.263 --> 21:22.997
-wait - he stole them?
-What do you mean?

21:23.099 --> 21:25.833
Why'd he take the hen
and the harp?

21:25.935 --> 21:27.735
-I don't know.
-But that's stealing.

21:29.439 --> 21:33.274
Anyway. "suddenly,
the harp sang, 'help, master!'

21:33.376 --> 21:37.612
"the giant woke up
and shouted, 'fi, fi, fo, fum!'

21:37.714 --> 21:39.280
"jack ran and started climbing
down the beanstalk

21:39.382 --> 21:41.515
"and the giant chased after him,
hot on his tail.

21:41.618 --> 21:43.017
"when jack reached the ground,
he looked up

21:43.119 --> 21:45.086
"and he saw the giant
coming fast,

21:45.188 --> 21:46.320
"so he grabbed an axe
from the woodpile

21:46.422 --> 21:48.589
"and started to chop
at the beanstalk.

21:48.691 --> 21:51.492
"after five chops, the beanstalk
crashed to the ground

21:51.594 --> 21:53.094
"and the giant was slayed."

21:53.196 --> 21:54.996
-slayed?
-Mm-hm. Yeah, he killed him.

21:55.098 --> 21:56.931
-He killed him?
-Mmm.

21:57.033 --> 21:57.932
He was chasing after him, so...

21:58.034 --> 22:00.501
Yeah, but he stole from him.

22:00.603 --> 22:02.470
The giant was just trying
to get back the hen

22:02.572 --> 22:03.604
and he murdered him.

22:09.879 --> 22:11.812
(sighs)

22:19.989 --> 22:21.889
oh, I missed a page.

22:21.991 --> 22:24.792
"so the police visited jack
the next day

22:24.894 --> 22:27.795
"and they arrested him
for theft and murder

22:27.897 --> 22:30.798
"and he went to jail
for the rest of his life.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.566
"the end."

22:32.669 --> 22:33.567
I don't like that story at all.

22:33.670 --> 22:35.236
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of it
either.

22:35.338 --> 22:38.806
It's terrible. The poor giant.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.474
Well, I guess the moral
of the story is,

22:40.576 --> 22:43.411
you know, don't, uh, steal,
don't murder,

22:43.513 --> 22:45.880
or you'll go to jail
for the rest of your life.

22:45.982 --> 22:47.214
Ok? So don't do it.

22:47.316 --> 22:49.617
That story sucks.

22:49.719 --> 22:51.786
Mmm. It does.

22:51.888 --> 22:54.121
Alright. Night-night.

22:54.223 --> 22:56.390
Goodnight.

22:56.492 --> 22:57.692
Mwah!

23:00.063 --> 23:01.595
(ray sighs)

23:11.507 --> 23:14.208
you ever read
'jack and the beanstalk'?

23:15.678 --> 23:17.478
A long time ago. Why?

23:17.580 --> 23:19.413
Jack was a piece of shit.

23:19.515 --> 23:21.082
Why do you say that?

23:21.184 --> 23:23.184
Well, he climbs
the beanstalk, right?

23:23.286 --> 23:24.018
Yeah.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.587
He goes into the giant's castle,

23:26.689 --> 23:29.590
steals the bloody harp,

23:29.692 --> 23:32.026
steals the goose
that lays the golden egg.

23:32.128 --> 23:33.928
-Yeah.
-Steals it.

23:34.030 --> 23:35.863
Runs off.

23:35.965 --> 23:38.699
So the giant goes after him,

23:38.801 --> 23:40.768
trying to get back
all the shit that jack stole.

23:40.870 --> 23:42.870
Yeah.

23:42.972 --> 23:45.439
And while he's climbing
down the beanstalk...

23:45.541 --> 23:48.509
(laughs) ..Jack chops it down

23:48.611 --> 23:49.310
and fuckin' murders him!

23:51.447 --> 23:53.214
-What a cunt!
-(ray laughs)
