01:11.507 --> 01:13.008
Zedd, behind you!

01:17.915 --> 01:19.181
For the glory of D'Hara!

01:33.030 --> 01:34.864
Command me, Confessor.

01:34.932 --> 01:36.766
Tell me why you attacked us.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.868
We have standing orders
to kill the Seeker.

01:38.936 --> 01:41.170
Maybe you haven't gotten word.
The war's over.

01:41.238 --> 01:43.306
Yes.

01:43.373 --> 01:45.207
But there's a rumor among
the officer corps

01:45.275 --> 01:47.109
that the Seeker
is of the Rahl bloodline,

01:47.177 --> 01:48.911
that he's next
in line for the throne.

01:48.979 --> 01:51.914
Then the D'Harans should
serve him, not try to kill him.

01:51.982 --> 01:54.283
My commanding officer,
General Grix

01:54.351 --> 01:56.819
wants to claim the throne
for himself.

01:56.887 --> 01:59.422
He's trying to eliminate anyone
that would challenge him--

01:59.489 --> 02:00.856
Not only the Seeker,
but rival generals

02:00.924 --> 02:02.391
in the D'Haran army as well.

02:02.459 --> 02:04.627
Only a Lord Rahl
can rule the empire,

02:04.695 --> 02:06.963
not some common foot soldier.

02:07.030 --> 02:10.333
This General Grix
doesn't sound very interested

02:10.400 --> 02:12.034
in the royal lines
of succession.

02:12.102 --> 02:14.303
Where can we find him?

02:14.371 --> 02:17.073
He may command a legion but Bain
is a man like any other.

02:17.140 --> 02:19.141
He'll be more open to compromise

02:19.209 --> 02:21.043
once he's lost someone close
to his heart.

02:21.111 --> 02:23.212
Order the quad
to deploy the first weapon

02:23.280 --> 02:26.549
in the General's
home village, Norwood.

02:26.616 --> 02:29.618
General Grix,
you have a visitor.

02:36.193 --> 02:37.927
I have a message for you, sir.

02:39.997 --> 02:41.998
I'm listening.

02:42.065 --> 02:44.100
You'll have
to read it for yourself.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.644
What does it say, sir?

02:57.948 --> 03:00.916
It's an invitation.

03:08.525 --> 03:10.326
General Grix isn't here.

03:10.394 --> 03:12.261
Where is he?
No one seems to know.

03:12.329 --> 03:14.130
He and his guards left
on horseback a day ago.

03:14.197 --> 03:15.765
They rode northeast.

03:15.832 --> 03:17.800
We'll track him.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.202
Confessor,
there's something else.

03:20.270 --> 03:22.004
A quad left the camp
on a raid this morning.

03:22.072 --> 03:24.407
They were armed
with a cache of Whisperers.

03:24.474 --> 03:25.741
"Whisperers"?

03:25.809 --> 03:28.210
Magical weapons.

03:28.278 --> 03:30.980
They kill by releasing
the captured screams

03:31.048 --> 03:32.548
of Shadow People.

03:32.616 --> 03:34.016
A sound so deadly
they can wipe out

03:34.084 --> 03:35.584
every living creature
within a league.

03:35.652 --> 03:37.520
Where is Grix getting
these weapons?

03:37.587 --> 03:39.789
I wish I knew, Confessor.

03:39.856 --> 03:42.258
I do know
that Grix wants to use them

03:42.325 --> 03:44.026
to wipe out the home villages
of his rivals,

03:44.094 --> 03:46.629
to scare them into submission.

03:46.696 --> 03:48.130
You and Zedd,
track the quad.

03:48.198 --> 03:50.499
Intercept them before they can
set off any of these Whisperers.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.667
We'll go after the General,

03:51.735 --> 03:53.369
find out where
he's getting these things.

03:53.437 --> 03:55.604
We'll meet up in the glade east
of Carthran Lake.

04:18.728 --> 04:21.063
Oh. I told you
we needed one alive.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.332
He could have killed you,
Confessor.

04:25.102 --> 04:26.702
Kahlan.

04:28.071 --> 04:29.305
There's one missing.

04:38.181 --> 04:40.449
Confessor, command me.

04:40.517 --> 04:41.817
Where's the other Whisperer?

04:41.885 --> 04:44.520
We hid it in Norwood...

04:44.588 --> 04:46.122
under the East bridge.

04:46.189 --> 04:47.156
When will it detonate?

04:49.059 --> 04:50.759
Answer me!

04:50.827 --> 04:54.697
When the sun reaches
its highest point in the sky.

04:55.932 --> 04:57.500
I'm so sorry.

04:57.567 --> 04:58.901
We have less than an hour.

04:58.969 --> 04:59.969
Guard the crate.

05:03.106 --> 05:05.207
If you had assumed the throne
of D'Hara months ago,

05:05.275 --> 05:06.842
the army would
be helping you in your quest

05:06.910 --> 05:08.410
instead of trying to kill you.

05:08.478 --> 05:10.312
If I'd claimed the throne,
I wouldn't be on a quest

05:10.380 --> 05:11.780
to find the Stone of Tears.

05:11.848 --> 05:13.182
I'd be too busy killing
and scheming

05:13.250 --> 05:14.717
to keep control of my empire.

05:14.784 --> 05:17.486
Sometimes ruthlessness is
required of a leader.

05:17.554 --> 05:20.890
Fear is the only thing
that has ever united D'Hara.

05:20.957 --> 05:22.825
I'd never try
to get people to follow me

05:22.893 --> 05:24.426
by killing and terrorizing them.

05:24.494 --> 05:27.429
Your sentiments are noble,
but impractical.

05:27.497 --> 05:29.532
A true leader takes power.

05:29.599 --> 05:32.001
He doesn't ask his subjects
for permission first.

05:32.068 --> 05:36.338
That was Darken Rahl's way,
not mine.

05:36.406 --> 05:37.740
Now, let's go find Grix.

05:44.414 --> 05:46.549
We're too late.

06:01.431 --> 06:03.332
What did you do?

06:24.521 --> 06:25.621
What happened?

06:25.689 --> 06:29.091
I cast a deafness spell.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.327
So we couldn't hear
the sound of the Whisperer.

06:31.394 --> 06:33.229
Which is the only reason
we're still alive.

06:33.296 --> 06:34.863
What about the villagers?

06:34.931 --> 06:36.465
They're fine.

06:36.533 --> 06:39.602
I spelled every living creature
from here to the horizon.

06:39.669 --> 06:41.670
Even the field mice
were protected.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.675
Well, I'm sure the field mice
are very grateful.

06:46.743 --> 06:49.945
Now let's get those Whisperers
and get back to Richard.

06:53.683 --> 06:56.552
A general trying
to conquer all of D'Hara

06:56.620 --> 06:59.021
makes a detour
to visit a brothel.

06:59.089 --> 07:01.290
Should I pretend
to be surprised?

07:04.127 --> 07:06.262
Welcome to
the Palace of Athania.

07:06.329 --> 07:07.796
What is your pleasure?

07:07.864 --> 07:11.267
Tonight it seems
the pleasure is all mine.

07:13.236 --> 07:14.870
Denna.

07:14.938 --> 07:17.439
It's good
to see you again, Seeker.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.310
I heard a rumor you were
traveling with a Mord-Sith.

07:21.378 --> 07:23.746
Thank you, Bella,
I'll look after our guests.

07:23.813 --> 07:24.780
Yes, Madame Denna.

07:24.848 --> 07:26.448
Madame Denna.

07:26.516 --> 07:28.517
The right hand
of Darken Rahl,

07:28.585 --> 07:31.787
reduced to peddling flesh.

07:31.855 --> 07:33.722
Times are difficult.

07:33.790 --> 07:36.225
A Mord-Sith has
to make a living

07:36.293 --> 07:38.627
now that the war is over.

07:38.695 --> 07:40.829
I'm simply taking
what I've learned

07:40.897 --> 07:43.666
and putting it to good use.

07:43.733 --> 07:48.570
Pleasure after all
is the inverse of pain.

07:48.638 --> 07:52.374
Knowledge of one makes mastery
of the other so much easier.

07:52.442 --> 07:55.244
You of all people
should know that, Cara.

07:55.312 --> 07:58.847
The place of a Mord-Sith
is at the side of Lord Rahl.

07:58.915 --> 08:03.018
So the rumors are true.

08:03.086 --> 08:05.587
We're looking for a D'Haran
General named Grix.

08:05.655 --> 08:07.423
Do you know him?

08:07.490 --> 08:09.358
I find it's good business
to be friendly

08:09.426 --> 08:10.993
with the local commanders.

08:11.061 --> 08:13.228
You provide them with whores

08:13.296 --> 08:16.131
and in exchange,
they leave you alone.

08:16.199 --> 08:18.500
Many of my clients would enjoy
your acerbic tongue.

08:18.568 --> 08:21.470
You could do very well here.

08:21.538 --> 08:23.172
What's your interest
in the general?

08:23.239 --> 08:25.774
He's gotten hold
of a supply of Whisperers.

08:25.842 --> 08:28.444
He's planning to use them
against other D'Haran officers,

08:28.511 --> 08:31.447
destroy their villages.

08:31.514 --> 08:34.750
If we don't find Grix, he could
wipe out half your clientele.

08:34.818 --> 08:37.519
If you know where he is,
you'd better tell me.

08:37.587 --> 08:39.455
He left.

08:39.522 --> 08:41.090
When you find him--

08:41.157 --> 08:44.025
and I'm certain you will.

08:44.094 --> 08:47.363
--remind him he still owes me
for the damage he caused.

08:47.430 --> 08:48.931
The General
and his men drank too much

08:48.998 --> 08:51.500
and destroyed one
of my finest suites.

08:51.568 --> 08:54.269
I'll pass that along.

08:54.337 --> 08:55.637
As pleasant as this has been,

08:55.705 --> 08:58.307
I have other guests
to attend to.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.976
But I hope you will
both indulge yourselves

09:01.044 --> 09:02.678
while you're here.

09:02.746 --> 09:04.780
Compliments of the house,
of course.

09:04.848 --> 09:09.051
It's the least I can do
for old friends.

09:24.234 --> 09:27.202
Sorcerer.

09:27.270 --> 09:29.638
Have you been selling these
weapons to the D'Harans?

09:29.706 --> 09:30.973
I had no choice, madame.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.275
I needed to sell Whisperers
to raise funds

09:33.343 --> 09:35.144
to complete
my work for you.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.045
This potion isn't easy
to come by.

09:37.113 --> 09:38.380
And it's not cheap.

09:38.448 --> 09:40.849
This single vial
is worth more than any jewel

09:40.917 --> 09:42.618
in the Caves of Coradin.

09:42.685 --> 09:46.288
You fool, you brought
the Seeker here.

09:46.356 --> 09:47.956
I thought you wanted the Seeker
to come here.

09:48.024 --> 09:49.458
I did.

09:49.526 --> 09:52.494
But not yet.

09:52.562 --> 09:56.632
I still haven't completed
the General's training.

10:11.473 --> 10:13.174
I know Denna.

10:13.241 --> 10:15.543
She's involved
with Grix in some way.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.912
I'm going
to take a look around.

10:17.979 --> 10:19.780
Find Zedd and Kahlan.
Bring them here.

10:19.848 --> 10:21.382
It will take at least a day

10:21.449 --> 10:23.450
to get back
to the meeting place.

10:23.518 --> 10:25.753
Kahlan and Zedd may
not even be there yet.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.255
If Denna is involved
with this general,

10:28.323 --> 10:30.658
I'm going to need Kahlan
to get the truth out of her.

10:30.725 --> 10:32.026
I can't leave you alone
with her.

10:32.127 --> 10:33.227
I can handle Denna.

10:34.963 --> 10:37.565
Go on, hurry.

10:46.074 --> 10:47.041
Excuse me.

10:48.577 --> 10:50.411
Are any of you acquainted
with a friend of mine?

10:50.478 --> 10:53.881
A D'Haran general, name of Grix.

10:53.949 --> 10:55.216
You're the Seeker, aren't you?

10:55.283 --> 10:56.784
Yes.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.556
You have done so much
for the people of the Midlands.

11:02.624 --> 11:06.193
Allow me to give you something
in return.

11:08.496 --> 11:09.897
Compliments of the house.

11:12.734 --> 11:15.469
Leaving so soon, Cara?

11:17.105 --> 11:20.441
Your merchandise is too delicate
for my taste.

11:20.508 --> 11:23.711
Of all the Sisters of the Agiel,

11:23.778 --> 11:26.447
you're the last I expected
to find with Richard.

11:26.514 --> 11:28.148
I serve Lord Rahl.

11:28.216 --> 11:31.418
You serve anyone
with a purse full of coins.

11:31.486 --> 11:33.654
You may find this hard
to believe,

11:33.722 --> 11:36.490
but I have a great deal
of affection for Richard.

11:36.558 --> 11:38.559
I admire him.

11:38.627 --> 11:41.528
But "Lord Rahl?"

11:41.596 --> 11:42.830
You doubt it?

11:42.897 --> 11:45.065
Do you truly believe Richard

11:45.133 --> 11:47.968
has what it takes
to rule the Empire?

11:48.036 --> 11:49.236
Is he bold enough,

11:49.304 --> 11:51.639
ruthless enough?

11:51.706 --> 11:53.040
It's not the place
of a Mord-Sith

11:53.108 --> 11:55.643
to question the Lord Rahl...

11:55.710 --> 11:56.977
only to serve him.

11:57.045 --> 12:00.581
And if you
were still a true Mord-Sith,

12:00.649 --> 12:02.149
you'd serve him too.

12:02.217 --> 12:04.652
Under the right circumstances,
I might.

12:04.719 --> 12:06.587
But I fear Richard's
been compromised.

12:06.655 --> 12:08.088
Compromised?

12:08.156 --> 12:09.556
By Kahlan.

12:09.624 --> 12:11.792
You've seen
the way they are together.

12:11.860 --> 12:15.696
She wouldn't need to confess him
to get him to do her bidding.

12:15.764 --> 12:18.832
He'd sacrifice anything
for her.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.403
His mission...
even you.

12:22.470 --> 12:25.406
You don't know the first thing
about the Mother Confessor.

12:25.473 --> 12:27.141
I know that Kahlan Amnell

12:27.208 --> 12:29.610
doesn't care for Mord-Sith.

12:29.678 --> 12:32.413
She tried to kill me, twice.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.516
She's a woman of honor.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.418
She spared my life

12:37.485 --> 12:39.553
even after she learned
I killed her sister.

12:41.589 --> 12:44.658
Her loyalties
aren't in question.

12:44.726 --> 12:46.727
Yours are.

12:46.795 --> 12:49.063
Safe journey, Cara.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.298
I'll take good care of Richard.

12:51.366 --> 12:56.036
If he has so much as a scratch
when I get back...

12:56.104 --> 12:58.072
you'll be sorry.

13:01.076 --> 13:02.376
You don't need to do that.

13:02.444 --> 13:04.778
I just want to talk.

13:04.846 --> 13:06.213
Don't you think I'm pretty?

13:06.281 --> 13:09.116
Yes. Very.

13:09.184 --> 13:10.551
But my heart is spoken for.

13:12.754 --> 13:15.522
It's not your heart
that I'm interested in.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.691
There are so many pleasures
to choose from.

13:17.759 --> 13:21.228
Madame Denna
has instructed me personally.

13:21.296 --> 13:23.964
I can even teach you some things

13:24.032 --> 13:27.134
this woman of yours may enjoy.

13:29.571 --> 13:31.372
I'm sure you're very good
at what you do.

13:31.439 --> 13:34.208
But I need to know
about General Grix.

13:39.481 --> 13:41.348
If I tell you...

13:41.416 --> 13:42.583
will you help me?

13:42.650 --> 13:43.584
Help you how?

13:46.054 --> 13:49.156
This is my son, Edrand.

13:50.425 --> 13:51.759
He's beautiful.

13:51.826 --> 13:53.660
His father--
my husband.

13:53.728 --> 13:56.597
--was killed during the war.

13:58.533 --> 14:02.336
Maybe even by the very soldiers
who come to this place.

14:04.005 --> 14:07.508
There's no other work for women
in ts province.

14:07.575 --> 14:10.043
I only do this
so I can feed my son.

14:10.111 --> 14:13.547
They say there's honest work
to be had in the Nathrin Valley,

14:13.615 --> 14:16.650
but it's far from here and there
are bandits on the roads--

14:16.718 --> 14:18.085
I'll make sure
you get there safely.

14:22.757 --> 14:24.825
Thank the Spirits
you came here, Seeker.

14:24.893 --> 14:27.361
I knew you'd help.

14:27.429 --> 14:30.531
Did the general say where
he was going before he left?

14:30.598 --> 14:32.633
The general never left.

14:32.700 --> 14:33.934
His horse is still
in the stables.

14:40.775 --> 14:42.309
Where is the Seeker?

14:42.377 --> 14:44.845
With Lucinda.

14:44.913 --> 14:47.614
Madame Denna told us there's
gonna be a big conclave

14:47.682 --> 14:49.016
at the palace tomorrow.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.384
She says General Grix
has invited

14:50.452 --> 14:51.985
every battalion commander
in the province.

14:52.053 --> 14:53.654
Did she say why?

14:53.721 --> 14:56.123
All I know is we're supposed to
keep the commanders "happy."

14:56.191 --> 14:58.692
That will be all.
Thank you, Lucinda.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.361
Yes, Madame.

15:03.665 --> 15:05.499
I thought I'd get
at least an hour.

15:08.269 --> 15:09.870
You don't fool me, Richard.

15:09.938 --> 15:12.473
We both know Lucinda

15:12.540 --> 15:15.008
isn't woman enough for you.

15:15.076 --> 15:17.244
There is someone else here

15:17.312 --> 15:20.981
who I believe you
would find very enticing.

15:21.049 --> 15:22.883
I'm surprised
you didn't request her.

15:22.951 --> 15:27.387
It's not often
I entertain guests personally

15:27.455 --> 15:30.057
but for you

15:30.124 --> 15:33.293
I could make an exception.

15:33.361 --> 15:36.230
If it would make
the experience more exciting,

15:36.297 --> 15:39.600
I could even put on
a white dress.

15:41.769 --> 15:43.437
Seeker!

15:46.975 --> 15:48.509
Seeker!
Let her go.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.192
Richard, no.

16:05.260 --> 16:06.360
Take her below.

16:08.329 --> 16:10.931
No! Madame, please, forgive me.

16:10.999 --> 16:14.001
I'll do anything you ask.

16:20.975 --> 16:22.509
Please...

16:22.577 --> 16:23.911
I have a son.

16:23.978 --> 16:25.379
You should have
thought about him

16:25.446 --> 16:27.781
before you talked to the Seeker.

16:27.849 --> 16:29.783
I'm ready to begin.

16:29.851 --> 16:31.485
Are you certain
we should do this?

16:31.553 --> 16:32.819
There's very little potion.

16:32.887 --> 16:36.089
I don't have soldiers at my beck
and call anymore.

16:36.157 --> 16:38.058
I need someone
to stop that Mord-Sith

16:38.126 --> 16:40.060
from bringing the Confessor
and the wizard back here.

16:40.128 --> 16:43.030
As you wish.

17:03.851 --> 17:05.319
No.

17:05.386 --> 17:08.387
Merciful creator
protect my child!

17:09.891 --> 17:12.224
Please. No.

18:08.383 --> 18:09.650
Who are you?

18:11.319 --> 18:12.386
Where am I?

18:12.453 --> 18:14.488
Everything's all right.

18:14.555 --> 18:15.956
I'm a friend.

18:16.024 --> 18:19.526
I've summoned your spirit
from the Underworld.

18:19.594 --> 18:21.028
What have you done to me?

18:21.095 --> 18:23.830
I've given you another body.

18:23.898 --> 18:25.966
Another chance at life.

18:27.602 --> 18:29.269
Why?

18:29.337 --> 18:32.005
So you can
take vengeance on Cara,

18:32.073 --> 18:35.175
the Mord-Sith who killed you.

18:51.229 --> 18:52.529
What do we say?

18:52.597 --> 18:54.632
Thank you, mistress.

18:54.699 --> 18:57.001
Whatever it
is you think you're doing,

18:57.068 --> 18:58.135
it won't work.

19:00.772 --> 19:03.874
You had the D'Haran Empire
within your grasp,

19:03.942 --> 19:07.177
and with it,
power beyond reckoning.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.580
All you needed to do

19:09.648 --> 19:12.416
was close your hand around it.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.418
But you didn't.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.619
You couldn't.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.289
You're weak, Seeker.

19:18.356 --> 19:20.991
Undeserving
of the title Lord Rahl.

19:21.059 --> 19:25.029
I don't have time to sit
on Darken Rahl's throne.

19:25.096 --> 19:26.764
I have a mission to complete.

19:26.831 --> 19:29.166
I know.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.303
The Stone of Tears.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.038
That compass won't guide you
to the Stone.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.272
It only works for me.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.341
I'd better hold on to it
for you then.

19:37.409 --> 19:40.778
I'd hate for it
to become damaged.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.715
I know all
about your scheme, Denna.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.817
The conclave.

19:46.885 --> 19:50.087
You're using Grix
to get his rivals to come here.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.923
You're planning to capture
and train them.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.725
and use them to rule D'Hara.

19:56.394 --> 19:59.129
I like how you think, Seeker.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.298
But there's a flaw in you plan.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.835
Assuming I could break
the entire officer corps,

20:04.903 --> 20:07.271
that only gives me
control of the army.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.506
To rule D'Hara,

20:09.574 --> 20:13.610
one requires
the loyalty of the people.

20:13.678 --> 20:16.814
For that,
I'd need a legitimate heir

20:16.881 --> 20:19.116
to the empire.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.386
Someone of the Rahl bloodline.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.522
You think you're
going to train me?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.825
You tried that before
and you failed.

20:27.892 --> 20:31.328
I don't need to train
you to control D'Hara.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.998
Whatever it is you're planning,
you won't succeed.

20:34.065 --> 20:37.301
Cara's on her way
to get Kahlan and Zedd.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.636
Unfortunately for you,

20:39.704 --> 20:43.207
Cara isn't going to live long
enough to deliver her message.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.210
Kahlan?

20:46.277 --> 20:48.312
Zedd?

21:23.980 --> 21:26.215
Who are you?

21:27.518 --> 21:29.853
Kahlan?

21:29.920 --> 21:30.987
You know me?

21:32.623 --> 21:34.691
It's me, Dennee.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.261
Your sister.

21:39.864 --> 21:41.564
My sister is dead.

21:41.632 --> 21:43.900
I know it's hard to believe,

21:43.968 --> 21:45.735
I don't look like myself,
but it is me.

21:45.803 --> 21:47.203
My spirit was summoned

21:47.271 --> 21:49.239
from the Underworld
and placed in this body.

21:49.306 --> 21:53.243
No, this is a trick.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.378
Whoever she is,
she did try to confess me.

21:57.414 --> 21:59.983
Do you remember
the meadowlark you found?

22:00.050 --> 22:02.318
The hatchling
with the broken wing?

22:02.386 --> 22:05.722
We brought it into the house.

22:05.789 --> 22:08.324
You nursed it until
it could fly.

22:08.392 --> 22:10.727
The day you set it free,
we both cried.

22:10.794 --> 22:12.328
Do you remember
what you told me?

22:14.999 --> 22:16.466
"The things you love--"

22:16.533 --> 22:18.334
"The things you love
will always come back to you."

22:18.402 --> 22:21.404
Look into my eyes.

22:21.472 --> 22:22.839
You'll see I'm telling
the truth.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.814
Little sister.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.289
Have I pleased you, Mistress?

22:39.356 --> 22:41.658
Very much so.

22:41.725 --> 22:44.627
I have one final task for you.

22:44.695 --> 22:46.596
When you've achieved it,

22:46.664 --> 22:49.165
you'll have completed
your training.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.500
Would that make you happy?

22:50.567 --> 22:55.104
Whatever makes you happy,
Mistress, makes me happy.

22:55.172 --> 22:59.309
I want you
to kill yourself.

23:03.681 --> 23:07.984
Mistress, how can I
serve you if I'm dead?

23:19.097 --> 23:21.331
General, don't give in to her!

23:24.234 --> 23:25.435
Do it now.

23:25.502 --> 23:27.370
Yes, Mistress.
General, no!

23:34.611 --> 23:35.578
You've lost your mind.

23:37.448 --> 23:40.316
Why train Grix if you were
just planning to kill him?

23:40.384 --> 23:41.784
<i>The woman said this</i>

23:41.852 --> 23:44.687
Mord-Sith had just left
and that she had killed you too.

23:44.755 --> 23:48.524
I'm so glad
that you're alive.

23:48.592 --> 23:50.293
She said once
I'd killed the Mord-Sith

23:50.361 --> 23:51.794
she'd help me start
a new life.

23:51.862 --> 23:54.097
Denna.

23:54.164 --> 23:56.666
Richard and I tracked Grix
to a brothel she's running.

23:56.734 --> 23:59.102
He thinks she's involved
with the general somehow.

23:59.169 --> 24:01.004
He sent me back here
to get you and Zedd.

24:01.071 --> 24:03.006
Apparently she was
supposed to stop me.

24:03.073 --> 24:05.241
What better assassin

24:05.309 --> 24:07.443
to send after a Mord-Sith

24:07.511 --> 24:09.479
than a Confessor
bent on revenge.

24:09.546 --> 24:11.047
Her touch would have
been deadly to Cara

24:11.115 --> 24:12.215
if you hadn't have
stopped her.

24:12.282 --> 24:13.616
Why did you, Kahlan?

24:13.684 --> 24:16.019
This woman and her
Sisters of the Agiel

24:16.086 --> 24:19.022
came to Valeria,
hunted us.

24:20.524 --> 24:22.825
I had to drown my own child
to keep him from them.

24:22.893 --> 24:26.262
They killed his father,
and then she killed me.

24:26.330 --> 24:27.730
I know.

24:27.798 --> 24:28.865
You know?

24:28.932 --> 24:30.700
There's so much
that I need to tell you,

24:30.768 --> 24:32.735
but I don't have any time.

24:32.803 --> 24:34.537
If Richard is with Denna,
he's in trouble.

24:34.605 --> 24:36.072
We need to go now.

24:36.140 --> 24:39.909
No. I'm not going anywhere
with that monster.

24:43.347 --> 24:46.249
Mistress, General Bain
has arrived with his battalion.

24:46.316 --> 24:48.684
And the rest of the officers?

24:48.752 --> 24:50.787
They'll be here soon.

24:50.854 --> 24:54.090
I want you and the others
to keep them in good spirits

24:54.158 --> 24:57.326
until I'm finished here.
Of course, Mistress.

24:59.530 --> 25:01.697
Hm.

25:01.765 --> 25:04.467
We could have been
so good together, Seeker,

25:04.535 --> 25:08.071
and in a way, we still can be.

25:08.138 --> 25:12.008
The pain will be brief,
but intense.

25:12.076 --> 25:13.543
You remember, don't you?

25:13.610 --> 25:16.946
Whatever you're planning,
Kahlan will stop you.

25:17.014 --> 25:19.248
Hm.

25:21.785 --> 25:24.153
Not this time.

25:24.221 --> 25:25.388
Goodbye, Seeker.

25:28.659 --> 25:31.127
I nearly killed Cara when
I learned what she did to you.

25:31.195 --> 25:32.462
Why didn't you?

25:32.529 --> 25:35.098
Richard.

25:35.165 --> 25:39.268
He needs her. She's proven
herself a loyal ally.

25:39.336 --> 25:43.606
I struggle every day
with what she did to you.

25:43.674 --> 25:46.109
A part of me still
wants vengeance,

25:46.176 --> 25:47.977
but I've had to put
those feelings aside.

25:48.045 --> 25:50.113
She isn't the person she was

25:50.180 --> 25:52.215
when she led that
mission to Valeria.

25:52.282 --> 25:53.583
She's changed.

25:53.650 --> 25:54.417
Kahlan.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.121
Something's wrong.
What is it?

25:58.188 --> 26:01.557
My Agiels. Their magic,
it's not working.

26:04.394 --> 26:05.495
There's no pain.

26:05.562 --> 26:06.929
How can that be?

26:06.997 --> 26:10.533
The Agiels get their power
from the Mord-Sith's bond

26:10.601 --> 26:13.736
with the presiding Lord Rahl.
Richard.

26:13.804 --> 26:17.540
If the bond has been severed,
it can only mean one thing...

26:20.644 --> 26:21.711
Richard's dead.

26:41.565 --> 26:44.367
How wonderful to see
you again, my brother.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.504
Welcome to the Underworld.

27:04.994 --> 27:07.229
There is someone else

27:07.297 --> 27:09.898
you should say hello to.
Another new arrival.

27:09.966 --> 27:12.367
I believe you're
already acquainted.

27:16.372 --> 27:17.706
Grix.

27:20.009 --> 27:21.877
The good general

27:21.945 --> 27:25.247
was one of my most
faithful servants.

27:25.315 --> 27:27.883
The chaos he unleashed
after my demise

27:27.951 --> 27:31.653
sent thousands of souls
to this place.

27:31.721 --> 27:34.389
I just offered to give
him a second life.

27:34.457 --> 27:37.626
A chance to continue his
ruthless ways as a baneling,

27:37.694 --> 27:39.928
but he refused.

27:39.996 --> 27:42.898
He says his "Mistress"
instructed him to turn down

27:42.966 --> 27:44.500
the Keeper's generous offer.

27:44.567 --> 27:45.701
Do you know why?

27:45.768 --> 27:49.104
Because he says that
she is going to use

27:49.172 --> 27:52.741
magic to place his spirit
in your body.

28:04.287 --> 28:06.755
For once,
our interests are aligned.

28:06.823 --> 28:09.691
If what Grix here
says is true,

28:09.759 --> 28:11.827
then Denna and this
sorcerer of hers

28:11.895 --> 28:13.328
have revived an ancient magic

28:13.396 --> 28:17.799
capable of stealing any soul
from the Underworld.

28:17.867 --> 28:20.369
The Keeper cannot allow
anyone to hold this power.

28:20.436 --> 28:22.938
He must have dominion
over the dead.

28:23.006 --> 28:24.706
You and your Keeper
are afraid of her.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.909
There isn't much time, Richard.

28:26.976 --> 28:29.311
Soon Grix will be summoned

28:29.379 --> 28:32.447
and there isn't anything
I can do to stop it.

28:32.515 --> 28:34.983
Once his spirit
is inside your body,

28:35.051 --> 28:38.086
you will be my guest
here for eternity.

28:38.154 --> 28:41.690
There's only one way
to thwart Denna's scheme.

28:41.758 --> 28:43.759
Accept my offer.

28:43.826 --> 28:45.694
Become a baneling.

28:45.762 --> 28:48.564
Return to your body
before it's too late.

28:48.631 --> 28:50.566
You're a fool if you
think I'm going to kill

28:50.633 --> 28:52.401
to serve the Keeper.

28:52.468 --> 28:53.902
You've already
killed enough people

28:53.970 --> 28:56.171
to earn yourself
a place of honor here.

28:56.239 --> 28:57.706
What difference
will a few more make?

28:57.774 --> 29:00.142
I won't do
the Keeper's bidding.

29:00.209 --> 29:02.911
You do the Keeper's bidding
every time you take a life.

29:02.979 --> 29:06.949
The reason you kill
doesn't make a difference.

29:07.016 --> 29:08.951
You want to see your beloved
Kahlan again, don't you?

29:09.018 --> 29:13.522
Kahlan will go on without me
and so will Zedd.

29:13.590 --> 29:17.025
He'll name a new Seeker,
they'll find the Stone of Tears

29:17.093 --> 29:19.795
and seal the rift.

29:19.862 --> 29:22.331
And you and your master will
be trapped in this pit forever.

29:30.473 --> 29:33.642
Well, at least I will have
the pleasure of your company.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.635
General?

29:59.702 --> 30:02.170
Mistress.

30:02.238 --> 30:04.172
I'm so pleased to see you again.

30:04.240 --> 30:09.044
It's time for you to play
the role I've trained you for.

30:09.112 --> 30:10.646
Are you ready?

30:10.713 --> 30:13.148
<i>You are going to have</i>

30:13.216 --> 30:17.719
the depths of time to reflect
on the mistake you just made.

30:17.787 --> 30:20.122
Your body may belong
to Denna now,

30:20.189 --> 30:22.824
but your eternal soul

30:22.892 --> 30:25.861
belongs to me.

30:40.009 --> 30:41.943
More wine, general?

30:43.713 --> 30:45.747
General Grix called us here
to negotiate a truce

30:45.815 --> 30:48.417
not to cavort with whores.

30:48.484 --> 30:50.385
Now, where is he?

30:50.453 --> 30:53.455
He's right here.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.326
The Seeker.

30:58.394 --> 31:00.629
I prefer the title

31:00.697 --> 31:04.566
"Lord Rahl."

31:04.634 --> 31:08.070
Rahl or not, my soldiers
will not fall to their knees

31:08.137 --> 31:11.139
before a man who has slaughtered
so many of their comrades.

31:11.207 --> 31:12.908
They will if they want
to keep their heads.

31:20.616 --> 31:21.550
Anyone else?

31:28.858 --> 31:30.959
Grix was a thug,

31:31.027 --> 31:32.594
but he had the right idea.

31:32.662 --> 31:34.463
Swear your allegiance to me

31:34.530 --> 31:35.897
and I will unite
your battalions

31:35.965 --> 31:37.933
and save D'Hara from itself.

31:48.578 --> 31:50.846
Warriors of D'Hara.

31:50.913 --> 31:53.949
Hear me.

31:54.016 --> 31:55.951
You knew me as the Seeker,

31:56.018 --> 31:59.254
but my true name
is Richard Rahl,

31:59.322 --> 32:01.289
son of Panis Rahl,

32:01.357 --> 32:04.860
and rightful heir
to the throne of D'Hara.

32:04.927 --> 32:07.863
Since the death of my brother,

32:07.930 --> 32:10.866
chaos has gripped our lands.

32:10.933 --> 32:13.668
While your generals send you
into battle against each other,

32:13.736 --> 32:16.371
dark forces have risen up,

32:16.439 --> 32:20.609
threatened your homes,
your families.

32:20.676 --> 32:24.012
We must not
be divided any longer!

32:24.080 --> 32:26.782
He's alive.

32:26.849 --> 32:29.084
That's not our Richard.

32:29.152 --> 32:32.020
Then why is the magic
of the Agiels back?

32:32.088 --> 32:35.323
Because the Seeker's heart
is beating again.

32:35.391 --> 32:37.292
Unlike a Confessor's,

32:37.360 --> 32:40.929
a Rahl's magic comes from
his blood, not his spirit.

32:40.997 --> 32:44.432
March with me into
the People's Palace,

32:44.500 --> 32:45.700
and I promise you:

32:45.768 --> 32:47.602
D'Hara will be restored

32:47.670 --> 32:49.404
to its days of conquest
and glory.

32:52.475 --> 32:55.744
March with me
to the People's Palace

32:55.812 --> 32:57.412
and to victory!

33:01.751 --> 33:04.386
<i>Master Rahl, guide us.</i>

33:04.453 --> 33:06.087
<i>Master Rahl, teach us.</i>

33:06.155 --> 33:07.255
<i>Master Rahl, protect us.</i>

33:07.323 --> 33:09.524
<i>In your light we thrive</i>

33:09.592 --> 33:11.793
<i>In your mercy we are sheltered</i>

33:11.861 --> 33:13.862
Well done, my lord.

33:25.316 --> 33:27.050
Only the prophets know
what dark spirits

33:27.117 --> 33:28.985
Denna's placed
inside Richard.

33:29.053 --> 33:31.120
Whoever it is,
he's fully in Denna's control.

33:31.188 --> 33:32.622
Mord-Sith only wear white

33:32.690 --> 33:34.424
when they've finished
breaking someone.

33:34.491 --> 33:36.492
How do we get him back?

33:36.560 --> 33:39.729
I'm not very familiar with
this kind of dark sorcery,

33:39.797 --> 33:41.064
but I do know that this Richard

33:41.131 --> 33:44.834
will have to die for the true
Seeker to live again.

33:44.902 --> 33:47.403
We'll find the sorcerer
who brought back Dennee,

33:47.471 --> 33:48.871
force him to do the same
for Richard.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.607
Where is this sorcerer?

33:50.674 --> 33:52.842
He must still be at the palace.

33:52.910 --> 33:54.310
You can get in.

33:54.378 --> 33:55.311
They know your face.

33:55.379 --> 33:57.947
I'll find him and confess him.

33:58.015 --> 33:59.716
I doubt Denna was planning
on letting you live

33:59.783 --> 34:01.184
if you came back.
I'll go with her.

34:01.251 --> 34:03.219
How will I explain
you to the guards?

34:03.287 --> 34:05.121
I'm sure I'm not the first
old man they've seen

34:05.189 --> 34:06.823
in the company of a pretty,
young courtesan.

34:06.890 --> 34:08.491
And Richard?

34:08.559 --> 34:10.360
We can't attack
an entire legion.

34:10.427 --> 34:12.762
We'll track them until
they make camp for the night,

34:12.830 --> 34:15.164
then slip in and find him.

34:15.232 --> 34:16.866
Then what?

34:16.934 --> 34:20.469
Kill Lord Rahl and simply
walk off with his body?

34:24.608 --> 34:26.576
You sent for me, Mistress?

34:26.643 --> 34:29.012
You're no longer
to address me as "Mistress."

34:29.079 --> 34:31.380
And from now on you will answer

34:31.447 --> 34:34.617
only to "Richard"
or "Lord Rahl."

34:34.685 --> 34:36.252
Do you understand?

34:36.320 --> 34:38.688
Of course, Mistr-- Denna.

34:40.357 --> 34:42.725
The men have earned
a few hours' rest,

34:42.793 --> 34:43.860
but I'm not tired.

34:46.929 --> 34:48.531
Take off your clothes.

34:58.809 --> 35:02.512
What are you doing here?

35:02.579 --> 35:04.547
I was told to come back after
I'd killed the Mord-Sith.

35:04.615 --> 35:06.282
She's dead?

35:06.350 --> 35:09.018
The woman who revived me

35:09.086 --> 35:11.888
said that she would help
me start a new life.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.860
She did ask me
to give you something.

35:21.665 --> 35:22.899
He's all yours.

35:32.543 --> 35:34.544
Command me, Confessor.

35:34.611 --> 35:37.680
You will restore
the Seeker to his body

35:37.748 --> 35:39.449
and the woman
who belongs to this one.

35:39.516 --> 35:42.785
I will do as you say, Confessor,

35:42.853 --> 35:45.822
but this elixir is very rare.

35:45.889 --> 35:47.990
There's only enough left

35:48.058 --> 35:51.694
to cast the spell one more time.

35:51.762 --> 35:53.629
I can only bring
one of you back.

36:15.219 --> 36:17.420
Take your hands off him.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.326
Kill her.

36:29.867 --> 36:31.434
Careful.

36:31.502 --> 36:33.636
You wouldn't want to get blood
over your nice white leather.

36:33.704 --> 36:35.204
Guards!

36:51.355 --> 36:53.422
Guards!

36:57.461 --> 36:59.362
Follow me.

37:09.506 --> 37:11.474
Kahlan!

37:11.542 --> 37:13.442
You aren't going to kill
the man you love.

37:14.912 --> 37:16.245
He's not the man I love.

37:18.115 --> 37:19.115
No!

37:21.218 --> 37:22.318
Drop your weapon

37:30.294 --> 37:33.062
Mistress?

37:33.130 --> 37:34.497
Kill them both.

37:34.565 --> 37:37.667
Stand down, all of you.

37:37.734 --> 37:40.136
What do you think you're doing,
lieutenant?

37:40.204 --> 37:41.838
It's no use, general.

37:41.905 --> 37:43.306
He's been confessed by me.

37:43.373 --> 37:45.575
Would one of you fools
run him through?

37:45.642 --> 37:46.843
You can try to kill him,

37:46.910 --> 37:48.511
but before he breaths
his last breath,

37:48.579 --> 37:50.079
he'll detonate that Whisperer.

37:50.147 --> 37:52.515
Every living thing within
a league of here will be dead.

37:56.753 --> 37:58.988
She's bluffing.

37:59.056 --> 38:01.624
Kill her.
General,

38:01.692 --> 38:04.026
you can live to fight another
battle if you leave now.

38:04.094 --> 38:06.996
Or you can listen to her
and throw all of our lives away.

38:08.699 --> 38:10.499
Do as I say.

38:12.836 --> 38:16.706
I don't take orders
from Mord-Sith.

38:18.775 --> 38:22.845
Only from the Lord Rahl
and he's dead.

38:22.913 --> 38:24.981
Order the battalion to withdraw.

38:28.418 --> 38:30.887
Cara, not now.
We came for Richard.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.572
May I speak with you?

38:56.275 --> 38:58.810
I just want you to know

38:58.878 --> 39:00.912
I regret
what I did in Valeria.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.620
I can't accept your apology.

39:08.687 --> 39:10.889
I needed to say it anyway.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.174
No!

39:39.852 --> 39:43.655
We will see each other again,
brother.

40:15.855 --> 40:17.622
Richard?

40:36.475 --> 40:39.110
I didn't think I was going
to see you again.

40:39.178 --> 40:40.178
Any of you.

40:41.780 --> 40:44.349
We should get moving.

40:44.416 --> 40:45.917
Still a lot of D'Haran
soldiers in the area.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.286
The compass.

40:48.354 --> 40:49.287
It's gone.

40:49.355 --> 40:50.588
Denna.

40:50.656 --> 40:53.424
She can't have gone far.

40:56.862 --> 41:00.398
Lucinda,
I'm glad you're all right.

41:00.466 --> 41:03.902
Actually, it's Dennee.

41:06.872 --> 41:07.972
It's true.

41:13.245 --> 41:14.245
I'm glad you're with us.

41:16.749 --> 41:20.018
But Lucinda, she lost her life
so I could have this body.

41:20.085 --> 41:23.187
There was only enough magic
to bring you back.

41:23.255 --> 41:26.157
We should find Denna
before the trail goes cold.

41:27.826 --> 41:30.595
We will.

41:30.663 --> 41:33.398
But first there's someone
else we need to see.

41:37.503 --> 41:39.337
She says you're
welcome to stay with her

41:39.405 --> 41:41.105
and raise the boy
as your own.

41:41.173 --> 41:42.540
May the Spirits protect you.

41:42.608 --> 41:44.776
You explained I'm not
really her daughter?

41:44.843 --> 41:46.945
She said
the boy needs a mother.

41:49.748 --> 41:51.349
He reminds me of my son.

41:51.417 --> 41:54.118
I'm sure Lucinda
would be very grateful.

41:55.988 --> 41:59.257
I'm not sure how I feel about
living another woman's life.

41:59.325 --> 42:00.458
Maybe I should go with you,

42:00.526 --> 42:02.226
help with your quest.

42:02.294 --> 42:03.595
It's too dangerous.

42:03.662 --> 42:05.396
I've already
lost you twice,

42:05.464 --> 42:07.665
I don't know what
I'd do if I lost you again.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.434
You'll be safer here.

42:09.501 --> 42:10.902
No one will know who you are.

42:10.970 --> 42:13.371
I've ordered him to stay

42:13.439 --> 42:16.841
and protect you in case
anyone does threaten you.

42:16.909 --> 42:20.511
When you need me,
you know where to find me.

42:22.781 --> 42:25.016
I'm so happy to have you back,
little sister.

42:36.228 --> 42:39.430
Now, let's find that compass.

42:43.569 --> 42:48.172
Hyah!
