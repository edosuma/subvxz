02:11.298 --> 02:13.801
Archers, hold!

02:19.932 --> 02:24.311
King Galenus of Argos! Show yourself!

02:43.205 --> 02:46.292
My sword against yours. Victor takes all!

02:46.417 --> 02:52.756
This city, or mine, this army, riches...

02:52.882 --> 02:55.467
subjects, all! Not another soldier will die!

02:58.262 --> 03:00.681
And I could do to replenish my ranks.

03:01.223 --> 03:05.394
What say you, most brave
and merciful king of Argos?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.980
Will you spare these men?

03:08.105 --> 03:11.984
King Amphitryon, I accept your challenge.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.278
Prepare to die.

04:19.927 --> 04:24.765
Amphitryon! Amphitryon! Amphitryon!

04:49.665 --> 04:52.209
The campaign ends here, for now.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.128
Chiron told me you took Egypt

04:54.253 --> 04:56.463
because they attacked our ships.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.006
That's right.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.217
But Argos, our neighbor, they presented
no threat.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.471
I see Chiron has been expanding your
Curriculum.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.766
I do not need a tutor to tell me
when there's peace.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.812
I took Argos for you.

05:11.937 --> 05:15.899
For me? You took Argos for its gold.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.361
Yes. That, too.

05:21.113 --> 05:24.908
But I'm told they're obsessed
with the gods here, just like you.

05:25.034 --> 05:28.912
You know, if they had as many soldiers
as they have priests...

05:29.038 --> 05:31.582
it would be my body on the pyre tonight.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.925
You summoned me, Majesty?
How is Prince Iphicles tonight?

05:42.051 --> 05:44.261
What will you teach him, Chiron?

05:46.513 --> 05:50.100
- Will you teach him war?
- It cannot be ignored, Majesty.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.978
History is but a chronicle of war.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.855
And war is but a chronicle of grief...

05:54.980 --> 05:57.649
recounted in the tears of young men's
Mothers.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.610
Sometimes, Majesty...

05:59.735 --> 06:03.781
I question who between us is the tutor
and who is student.

06:14.583 --> 06:19.546
In my own vanity, I thought I could bring
Tenderness...

06:19.671 --> 06:22.299
to a man whose craving for power is sated
by nothing...

06:22.424 --> 06:24.718
and only grows with each victory.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.179
No god's wrath could bring the anguish...

06:27.304 --> 06:30.557
that my king has beset upon this land.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.644
And so I prostrate myself before you,
Goddess.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.146
Deliver us from this curse.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.317
Help my people.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.530
Majesty!

06:47.991 --> 06:50.077
Hera accepts your gift.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.375
Goddess Hera?

06:56.500 --> 07:00.129
Queen Alcmene... approach.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.214
Majesty, no!

07:02.339 --> 07:05.300
Closer. Let me look upon you.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.139
You will have your deliverer.
Another son you shall bear.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.851
No. Please not by this man. Please,
Goddess--

07:13.976 --> 07:17.563
Tell me, would you betray your king...

07:17.688 --> 07:20.774
as my king betrays me in his lust for you?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.776
Would you have his mortal son to quell
your sorrow...

07:22.901 --> 07:26.071
and bring peace to this land?

07:28.198 --> 07:31.577
Would you bear the son of Zeus?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.372
For the sake of peace, I would.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.500
Then, for the sake of peace,
I shall permit it.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.380
Name him what you wish,
but I shall know him as "Hercules".

07:43.505 --> 07:46.341
Hercules

08:53.158 --> 08:54.493
Where is he?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.045
Who is he?

09:05.170 --> 09:08.966
Who is this man you spurn me
for night after night? Who?

09:09.091 --> 09:11.301
Please, Majesty!
- Where is he?

09:11.426 --> 09:12.803
My king!

09:14.304 --> 09:19.434
Intruder! Search the camp!
Find him! Find him!

09:49.423 --> 09:52.217
Speak.
-It's a boy, Sire.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.428
A fine, large boy.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.778
His name will be Alcides...

10:11.903 --> 10:15.115
and he will never be an equal
to his older brother.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.502
Hercules.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.797
Your name shall be Hercules.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.573
Be careful, there are snakes in the trees!

10:56.698 --> 10:58.617
I didn't know you fear them!
- Watch out!

11:09.002 --> 11:10.837
So, what else do you fear?

11:12.214 --> 11:15.300
I fear but one thing. I always have.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.929
Your departure, each and every time.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.808
Is this another private hideaway?

11:24.142 --> 11:27.020
You just wait. I think you'll like it.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.369
Alcides!

11:46.289 --> 11:48.125
Stop!

12:11.106 --> 12:12.899
Alcides!

12:16.987 --> 12:18.363
Lose something?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.324
You made me nearly faint with fright!

12:24.619 --> 12:26.163
Come. Come here.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.855
I like your necklace.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.360
My mother once gave this
as a parting gift to my father.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.032
And though she's with the gods now...

13:03.867 --> 13:05.619
I want you to have it.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.852
It's only stone...

13:31.812 --> 13:33.688
but I wish it were gold.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.483
I wish there were a substance finer

13:36.608 --> 13:38.151
than that to have you remember me by.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.824
There is.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.245
My mind's eye.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.290
Where your face has been etched since

13:52.415 --> 13:54.835
the day I first saw you.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.576
Careful.
Your horse could have lost its footing.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.829
You be careful... brother.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.790
Princess, your father is worried.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.834
A search party was dispatched.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.752
It's lucky you knew where to find us.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.172
Yes. Though I'd rather it had been
some other man's luck.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.262
Princess,
you rode out without saying a word.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.556
And what word would have
permitted me to?

14:50.140 --> 14:53.602
And what word would have
permitted me to?

14:53.727 --> 14:56.521
There is a feast tonight
and she must not be late.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.191
Yes, my Prince.
- No, brother.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.402
You ride with me.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.156
We'll see each other tonight.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.415
Saw your hoof marks in the forest.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.292
Tell me, what would you have done

15:17.417 --> 15:18.752
if she'd been thrown and broken her neck?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.879
I thought you knew her better.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.131
More likely I would break my neck.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.468
I saw more than hoof marks today.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.972
Did you?
- Watch yourself!

15:32.015 --> 15:35.352
I've known her just as long as you have,
and with a more mature eye!

15:35.477 --> 15:38.438
I'm older than you, Alcides,
and heir to the throne!

15:50.784 --> 15:53.745
Let's back away slowly.
Don't turn your horse.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.873
No, let's escape. Your horse can outrun it.
- Yours wouldn't.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.716
What are you doing?

16:07.968 --> 16:11.721
Now, back your horse behind me.
- Oh, yes, of course.

16:11.846 --> 16:15.266
And what a tale of bravery the next king
of Tiryns will have to tell tonight.

16:17.686 --> 16:21.690
Iphicles! The point
of this was for one of us to get away.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.908
A Nemean lion.
- A man eater! They can't be killed!

16:39.249 --> 16:40.834
Our spears are useless!

16:54.597 --> 16:56.349
Alcides!

17:17.704 --> 17:21.124
Iphicles. Where have you been?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.917
What is that thing? Take it off.

17:24.044 --> 17:28.673
Why, it appears to be the skin
of the Nemean lion!

17:29.424 --> 17:32.635
The lion, which I killed but two hours ago.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.388
Look, this is where it struck.
You see, Father?

17:35.513 --> 17:40.226
But I'm all right. No cut to the eye.
- Where was your brother in this contest?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.771
Alcides?

17:46.483 --> 17:49.194
He ran away at the first sign of danger.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.615
Have you ever known
my brother flee danger?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.909
Have you, Princess?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.870
No. Never.

17:58.995 --> 18:03.416
Well... I thought you knew him
better than that.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.589
Tell them. Father.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.967
So it has a chance to sink
into some of the thicker heads here.

18:15.762 --> 18:20.141
My friend, King Tallas the Brave,
ruler or Crete...

18:20.266 --> 18:23.561
we have enjoyed free
commerce between our lands...

18:23.686 --> 18:27.107
tonight we make a bargain
for something far greater.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.400
The peace between our houses
will be sealed four moons hence...

18:29.526 --> 18:34.614
with the harvest moon,
when my heir, Prince lphicles..

18:34.739 --> 18:38.076
Will take the Princess
of Crete to be his wife!

18:38.827 --> 18:40.370
Yes!

19:00.974 --> 19:03.268
Hebe! Hebe, stop!

19:16.447 --> 19:19.117
Why don't you enlighten me
on what just happened.

19:19.242 --> 19:23.371
I believe the announcement
took them by surprise, Father.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.707
The only surprise is that you allowed her
to behave in such a manner...

19:25.790 --> 19:30.503
without even lifting a finger, lion slayer.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.007
What could I have done?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.342
I am Amphitryon the Conqueror...

19:36.467 --> 19:39.095
ruler of the realm, vanquisher of Argos.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.890
You are my son,
and tonight you stood and watched...

19:42.015 --> 19:45.768
as your future wife made
a fool of you and me...

19:45.894 --> 19:48.313
in front of our most formidable
threat: Crete.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.900
Look at them. It makes you look weak.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.361
I'm sorry, Father.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.614
I want you to be a man.

19:57.739 --> 20:01.326
You're the future king of Tiryns. Act like it.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.124
Hebe! Hebe, stop!

20:08.249 --> 20:10.543
Stop! Stop!

20:21.012 --> 20:22.680
Come here.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.477
I won't marry him.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.479
I'd rather die.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.650
I love you.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.655
I love you, too.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.324
I need you strong.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.826
Are you strong?

20:46.246 --> 20:49.624
I want to leave with you... tonight.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.892
If we can make it across the river to Tyga...

21:08.017 --> 21:09.727
the King's men Won't follow us.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.952
That's them!
- Go, Hebe, run west!

21:26.077 --> 21:29.580
No, I won't leave you!
- I'll be right behind you! Go!

21:30.999 --> 21:32.458
After them!

21:36.379 --> 21:38.840
You two, follow her! Now!

21:42.885 --> 21:45.513
You heard the orders! Don't hurt the Prince!

22:01.571 --> 22:02.989
Faster!

22:15.460 --> 22:18.546
Stop! Stop!
- Alcides!

22:22.425 --> 22:25.470
Hebe!
- Help!

22:26.429 --> 22:28.181
Alcides!

22:29.599 --> 22:31.100
Help!

22:43.696 --> 22:45.365
Alcides!

23:20.441 --> 23:22.652
Captain Sotiris.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.695
Is the Fourth Battalion ready
to sail tomorrow?

23:24.821 --> 23:28.783
160 men, Your Grace, ready
and accounted for, as you commanded.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.620
Good. You'll take half. No more.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.207
Half?
- You are young.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.794
Learn to keep 80 in line and we'll see
about expanding your command.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.135
You disapprove?

23:48.886 --> 23:51.389
No, Your Grace.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.184
We'll be victorious and honor your name.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.603
I have him, Father!

24:06.737 --> 24:09.782
I understand you're having some trouble
with the arrangements we've made.

24:09.907 --> 24:14.036
Your arrangements you may find spoiled
by the next harvest moon.

24:14.162 --> 24:17.999
I think not.
You sail to Egypt tomorrow.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.840
There's been a revolt in Heliopolis,
north of the Nile River delta.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.969
You will enjoy war, Alcides,
and you will forget all this.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.346
I certainly don't fear for your survival.

24:33.431 --> 24:37.143
May your mother's gods be with you,
if they be at all.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.481
Ask him about Hebe.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.316
One final thing.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.902
Your brother here seems
obsessed with the thought...

24:46.027 --> 24:48.404
that you've taken the girl's maidenhood.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.491
Why don't you reassure him
that's not the case.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.242
Certainly, I shall.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.787
I assure you, brother...

24:58.080 --> 24:59.999
it's none of your business.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.516
I wish you endless victories
in the battlefield, brother.

25:16.641 --> 25:20.436
Because if you return here, I will kill you.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.987
Alcides, I beg you to understand...

25:30.112 --> 25:32.698
that you have a purpose
on this earth beyond this one desire.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.701
I've no purpose other than claiming
the love that is mine!

25:35.826 --> 25:39.497
I damn the King for denying it to me, and I
damn the gods for taking her from me!

25:39.622 --> 25:42.667
Hercules!
- Majesty, no.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.674
What did you call me?

25:49.799 --> 25:52.927
You are not the son of Amphitryon.

25:53.052 --> 25:57.431
I swear on my love for you,
you are Hercules...

25:57.557 --> 26:00.851
Gift of Hera, son of Zeus.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.312
Chiron.
- My Prince.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.439
Has my mother spoken of this to anyone?

26:05.565 --> 26:08.442
No. I assure you, no one.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.195
Because the King is a jealous man...

26:11.320 --> 26:14.407
and most likely would believe this mad talk.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.624
Open the gates!

26:47.690 --> 26:49.233
Alcides!

26:52.278 --> 26:53.571
Hold!

26:55.531 --> 26:58.826
Have heart, my love!
I will return before you know it!

26:58.951 --> 27:00.953
And you will be marrying me!

27:01.454 --> 27:03.331
Three moons from now!

28:07.603 --> 28:09.105
What troubles you?

28:11.899 --> 28:14.151
The King first ordered my full company...

28:14.276 --> 28:16.612
then halved it before we left.

28:17.321 --> 28:21.075
There's no campaign underway.
Peace is secured in Crete.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.494
Two divisions lay idle in camp.

28:23.619 --> 28:27.081
Why would that fool deny me even
the smallest excess of troops?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.292
We do not know what awaits us
in Heliopolis!

28:50.563 --> 28:54.316
Horus Pass.
We'll be there by sunset and make camp.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.485
There must be another way
than through a pass.

28:56.610 --> 29:00.072
Along with our numbers,
our route was changed as well.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.200
Your father wants us
in Heliopolis a day sooner.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.744
Scouts forward!

29:20.384 --> 29:22.094
Plenty of water for all!

29:23.220 --> 29:25.222
Cold and clean.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.726
Any word of the scouts?
It's been too long since they left.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.937
Make camp here.
Feed the horses and the men.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.148
Now, we need 20 volunteers on foot...

29:34.273 --> 29:36.317
cause we're gonna secure the passage.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.160
Some say the Golden Eagle's
a sign from Zeus.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.245
Yes. And some believe it's just a bird.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.737
Sotiris.

30:25.699 --> 30:29.286
Men... fall back to the camp.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.217
I led them to their deaths.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.533
Fall back! Retreat! Back the way we came!

31:18.544 --> 31:20.170
Battle formation!

31:23.883 --> 31:25.801
Testudo!

31:34.852 --> 31:36.145
Archers!

33:06.944 --> 33:09.071
Archers! Form up!

33:27.923 --> 33:30.300
We're the only two left!
- Take them alive!

33:47.985 --> 33:49.653
Commander Tarak.
- Over here.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.321
The Prince's helmet.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.826
Who is the captain?

33:56.410 --> 33:58.037
I am.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.958
Is this the helmet of the Prince
named Alcides?

34:05.419 --> 34:07.046
Is it?
- Yes.

34:07.171 --> 34:09.172
Where does he lie?

34:13.761 --> 34:15.846
Where does he lie?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.348
He lies there.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.225
Where you got him.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.938
Take this to the King.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.987
Captain, you are strong-willed...

34:32.112 --> 34:34.197
but this one, even half dead...

34:34.322 --> 34:36.574
he's twice as strong as my best fighter.

34:36.699 --> 34:41.413
If I thought you'd live,
I'd sell you both for a princely sum.

34:43.123 --> 34:47.085
Sell us. Sell us!
Sell us.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.340
We will live.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.678
Who are you, soldier?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.598
Hercules.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.603
I cooled it off for you.

36:28.937 --> 36:32.900
There's far worse pain awaiting
where you two are going.

36:35.444 --> 36:37.362
Would the King really do this?

36:37.487 --> 36:40.490
Sacrifice is own men to ensure
the death of one?

36:40.616 --> 36:42.492
His own son!

36:44.328 --> 36:46.455
Why did you choose to live?

36:49.041 --> 36:50.292
Do you know of the engagement...

36:50.417 --> 36:53.921
between my brother lphicles
and Hebe, Princess of Crete?

36:54.046 --> 36:57.382
Yes.
It was announced before our departure.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.261
I must make it back to Tiryns
before the wedding.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.098
You stay by my side...

37:05.807 --> 37:08.018
I'll make you a guest of honor...

37:08.644 --> 37:12.314
at what shall be my wedding.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.780
I fear you've been within
the palace walls too long, my Prince.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.452
I've traveled the world...

37:26.370 --> 37:29.206
and I know what's out there.
- You are wrong.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.252
Surely you have something to return to.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.505
Of course.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.551
A wife and son.
- Set your mind on them.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.845
And nothing else!

37:56.275 --> 37:58.026
So, tell me...

37:58.694 --> 38:02.406
who is this... Hercules?

38:03.657 --> 38:05.409
I don't yet know.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.978
Mother?

38:34.563 --> 38:36.315
Are you sick, Mother?

38:37.316 --> 38:40.902
Do I seem so?
- Often. At the sight of me.

38:41.028 --> 38:42.988
This is foolish talk.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.325
You are my son.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.243
The one who is living.

38:49.578 --> 38:51.038
Yet I feel more absent
than the one who is not.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.541
Iphicles...
we are both grieving.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.210
But in this sea of grief there
must be a drop of felicitation.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.421
I am to be wed three moons hence.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.258
Yes.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.762
You are right.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.223
You have won yourself a fine bride.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.852
A bride, yes. But have I won a wife?

39:15.145 --> 39:17.439
She will serve you well.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.026
Is this my hope?

39:21.151 --> 39:24.363
Mother, how do I win her
as my father won you?

39:24.488 --> 39:27.157
Please. I am not Alcides.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.742
I know that. To her or to you.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.660
Your father won me but for a moment...

39:30.786 --> 39:33.830
which passed so fast I cannot remember.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.291
This is what you will have with Hebe.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.335
This is what has come of it.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.630
A marriage that she does not want...

39:43.799 --> 39:46.510
and the death of your brother.

39:56.186 --> 39:58.730
I paid good money for both of you.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.941
I expect a return.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.782
Hercules, what is it?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.700
It's the first full moon.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.412
She does not even know I live.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.638
Come on!

40:32.431 --> 40:34.433
You miserable misers!

40:35.350 --> 40:38.103
I was told you Sicilians had money!

40:43.233 --> 40:45.902
Who wants to bet on Sotiris?

40:49.573 --> 40:52.701
Tell me, friend,
can you win your way out of here?

40:52.826 --> 40:54.286
Oh, yes.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.581
That way.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.724
You're next, Greek.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.935
You'd better win just as much
as your friend there...

41:19.060 --> 41:22.355
or perhaps you prefer to breathe mud.

41:24.107 --> 41:28.361
You said... "Stay by my side."

41:28.987 --> 41:30.697
I say we're doomed.

41:30.822 --> 41:35.243
I promise you,
I will return you to your family.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.163
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

42:39.933 --> 42:48.650
Kill! Kill! Kill!

42:55.699 --> 42:58.285
You called for me. I am here.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.496
Thank you for joining me...

43:02.163 --> 43:04.583
so that Hera may bless this marriage.

43:12.716 --> 43:14.759
Why do you look at me this way?

43:15.969 --> 43:18.638
Have you found peace, Alcmene?

43:19.598 --> 43:20.223
If you will tell me

43:20.348 --> 43:24.269
how my son found his death,
I would.

43:28.565 --> 43:30.942
Will you tell me how he found life?

43:31.067 --> 43:32.819
Yes.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.530
Yes, Amphitryon, at long last I will tell you.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.992
He was not my son, I know it!

43:40.910 --> 43:44.247
Do not dare deny it!
- I will not.

43:44.372 --> 43:48.877
Who sired him? Tell me!
Do you even know?

43:49.002 --> 43:51.004
How many lovers did you take?
- One!

43:51.129 --> 43:53.715
You lie!
- I took one for a single night...

43:53.840 --> 43:57.469
and for a single purpose:
To put an end to your rule!

44:01.014 --> 44:02.682
Tell me!
- Zeus!

44:02.807 --> 44:04.684
Zeus came to my bed
and planted a seed in me...

44:04.809 --> 44:07.729
to spawn a son to end your tyranny!

44:07.854 --> 44:11.650
And now, you have murdered
the son of the god of gods...

44:11.775 --> 44:15.278
and you are doomed. You are doomed.

44:22.661 --> 44:25.038
You're doomed.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.875
No! No!

44:39.052 --> 44:41.054
The Queen...

44:41.179 --> 44:44.766
in her grief, has taken her own life.

44:51.523 --> 44:55.860
You made me a fortune today, Hercules.

44:55.985 --> 44:58.029
Your trifles are of no interest to me.

44:58.154 --> 45:02.283
A man of great enterprise.
- "Great enterprise."

45:03.201 --> 45:05.787
You want real enterprise,
you take us to Greece.

45:05.912 --> 45:08.998
Greece?
- In the kingdoms of Greece...

45:09.124 --> 45:10.750
your games would draw thousands.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.461
I draw thousands here.

45:14.796 --> 45:17.632
Thousands of laughs, he means.
- Laughs? What do you mean?

45:18.466 --> 45:22.929
Let me put it this way,
in King Amphitryon's lands...

45:23.054 --> 45:25.765
sport is war and war is sport.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.016
And between the two, the King...

45:27.142 --> 45:30.395
is Hades' most reliable supplier.

45:31.354 --> 45:34.816
Now, they hold an event once a year...

45:34.941 --> 45:39.195
that is the most elaborate,
beautiful and rich affair--

45:39.320 --> 45:41.906
You know, actually, it's not for you.
No, it's the purest stuff there.

45:42.031 --> 45:46.035
None of this slipping in mud,
dancing on beams.

45:46.161 --> 45:48.747
Oh, no. Just men on solid ground...

45:48.872 --> 45:50.582
wielding bronze forged into shapes...

45:50.707 --> 45:53.376
even the tyrant King himself
could not have conceived of.

45:53.501 --> 45:57.046
How is the wagering?
- How's the wagering?

45:58.339 --> 46:02.385
My friend, I doubt you have
the imagination to even dream of it.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.512
For example, in the final contest,
and that means...

46:04.637 --> 46:07.682
the richest contest, mind you...

46:09.184 --> 46:11.811
two men fight against six.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.606
Six that have never been beaten.

46:14.731 --> 46:18.610
Now, if they win, well, the two go free.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.987
But the odds would be against it.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.491
You'd find advantage in that, I'm sure.
- But if they win--

46:24.616 --> 46:26.618
Tidy sum of gold in it for you.

46:27.452 --> 46:29.788
Why would I fight you two?

46:29.913 --> 46:32.457
We've never lost.
- Neither have they.

46:33.833 --> 46:36.002
Cut his head off,
he would not be any dumber

46:36.127 --> 46:38.505
One must fight with brawn and brain.

46:38.630 --> 46:40.215
Mind your words, my friend.

46:40.340 --> 46:44.928
I will arrange the grandest arena in Sicily.

46:45.053 --> 46:49.015
You two battling Half-Face and Humbaba.

46:49.140 --> 46:52.477
The victors shall go on a boat...

46:52.560 --> 46:55.522
with me to Greece.

47:02.445 --> 47:06.699
And now... for the event you
have been waiting for!

47:06.825 --> 47:09.661
Four unbeaten champions of Sicily...

47:09.786 --> 47:13.790
battling for a journey
to the greatest tourney in Greece!

47:13.915 --> 47:17.085
I give you the ferocious...

47:17.210 --> 47:19.337
the terrifying...

47:19.462 --> 47:24.050
Half-Face and Humbaba!

47:28.555 --> 47:31.432
And their challengers...

47:31.558 --> 47:37.939
Hercules and Sotiris of Tiryns!

47:59.794 --> 48:01.337
Hercules!

48:10.638 --> 48:12.473
Humbaba!

48:37.999 --> 48:40.835
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

49:01.981 --> 49:05.944
Fight! Fight! Fight!

49:39.018 --> 49:40.436
Sotiris!

50:39.120 --> 50:42.331
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

50:46.669 --> 50:49.088
Are you mad? He was wounded.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.549
You killed the only man
who could replace him.

50:51.674 --> 50:52.842
I can still fight, Lucius!
- Right!

50:52.967 --> 50:55.553
Against the six best fighters in Greece.

50:55.678 --> 50:58.681
You're as good as dead.
The agreement is off.

50:58.806 --> 51:02.727
You're back in the pits tomorrow.
- We won't fight.Unless in Greece.

51:02.852 --> 51:03.895
Then you'll die.

51:04.020 --> 51:07.982
Go ahead, kill us.
Who then will fight for your silver?

51:08.107 --> 51:08.775
You dare to threaten me?

51:08.858 --> 51:12.070
Would you really lose
your two best fighters?

51:12.528 --> 51:15.656
Would you see your money bag
even a single piece of silver lighter...

51:15.782 --> 51:18.076
you miserable, gutless old miser?

51:18.201 --> 51:20.328
Look at you! You can hardly walk!

51:20.453 --> 51:23.831
You're useless!
What I need to take you for?

51:23.956 --> 51:25.708
Because you're setting him free.
- No, Hercules.

51:25.833 --> 51:29.378
I will fight them. Alone.

51:30.505 --> 51:33.466
Then you are going to a certain death.

51:47.647 --> 51:50.483
We have another two days at sea!

51:50.608 --> 51:54.070
He's been at the bow
ever since we left the port.

52:15.758 --> 52:18.594
My name is Sotiris,
Captain of the Fourth Division.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.681
I rode for Heliopolis with your Prince...

52:21.806 --> 52:23.724
and we're the only two survivors.

52:23.850 --> 52:27.854
The other is a man of much renown.

52:28.896 --> 52:31.023
His name is Hercules.

52:39.699 --> 52:43.327
A man has come to our shores!

52:43.452 --> 52:47.999
A slave with the name of Hercules!

52:48.124 --> 52:51.460
A "Gift of Hera" we are to believe!

52:51.586 --> 52:56.299
We return him not as a man,
but as a pile of bloody guts and bone...

52:56.424 --> 53:00.595
on which the canines
of Olympus may feast!

53:05.016 --> 53:07.602
I give you...

53:07.727 --> 53:10.271
Hercules!

53:16.944 --> 53:19.780
He is fighting for his freedom...

53:19.906 --> 53:26.162
against the six greatest undefeated
champions of Greece!

53:42.011 --> 53:44.555
Commander. Captain.

53:45.097 --> 53:49.060
See for yourself.
- And you tell us this is Prince Alcides?

53:49.227 --> 53:51.103
And if it is, you're with us?

53:51.229 --> 53:54.190
Yes. And not us alone,
Sotiris. I promise you.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.610
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

56:34.683 --> 56:36.560
My Prince.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.854
Chiron, give me news of Hebe!

56:40.022 --> 56:42.400
Please, Chiron, will you bring her to me?

56:43.776 --> 56:45.778
I will find some way.

56:46.737 --> 56:49.782
Thank you, Sotiris.
I know you have someone to see, as well.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.200
Soon enough.

56:53.452 --> 56:54.703
Tell him the condition of the army.

56:54.829 --> 56:58.040
There's a great mistrust ever since
your company perished.

56:58.165 --> 57:01.669
The King is squeezing anything he can
from the people to hire foreign mercenaries.

57:01.794 --> 57:04.422
I will sound out our most trusted officers.

57:04.547 --> 57:06.048
They will rally to us.

57:09.385 --> 57:12.138
And my brother, will he come to our side?

57:12.263 --> 57:15.057
It is his men pillaging the villages.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.768
And any spoils are their wages.

57:17.893 --> 57:20.354
I fear you'll have to defeat...

57:20.479 --> 57:22.815
both this king and the next.

57:25.109 --> 57:28.779
Chiron, you must not let on a thing to Hebe.

57:28.904 --> 57:30.990
She could never hide happiness.

57:31.115 --> 57:34.452
Now, "Gift of Hera"...

57:34.577 --> 57:38.956
call upon all your strength,
because I must tell you something.

57:44.003 --> 57:47.256
I have terrible news about your mother.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.967
She is no longer with us.

57:50.092 --> 57:54.263
She met her death with her own dagger.

57:57.808 --> 58:01.395
I drew it myself from her chest...

58:02.188 --> 58:04.690
as the King fled the temple.

58:05.483 --> 58:08.652
Your name was on her dying breath.

58:12.907 --> 58:14.992
The King will pay for this.

58:20.289 --> 58:22.583
Will your men stay behind us?

58:23.667 --> 58:25.961
They are your men now.

58:26.670 --> 58:30.257
They will stand behind you.

58:30.382 --> 58:32.718
As will I.

58:34.428 --> 58:35.721
Out of my way, woman!

58:35.846 --> 58:37.932
Move, woman! Move!

58:38.849 --> 58:40.643
We're taking your property
in the name of the King!

58:40.768 --> 58:42.853
No! Please, don't!

58:44.939 --> 58:46.565
Get down on your knees!

58:46.690 --> 58:49.860
Does it really take four men
to steal one man's livelihood?

58:51.487 --> 58:52.947
Draw swords!

58:53.697 --> 58:55.199
Stand down.

59:17.137 --> 59:22.977
Is it true? You are Hercules, the god?

59:25.020 --> 59:27.606
No, I'm just a man.

59:32.236 --> 59:34.446
It's time to send the King a message.

59:42.746 --> 59:45.624
Now I understand why your men
prefer desertion, lphicles.

59:45.749 --> 59:48.168
I just received the news.
- Of what?

59:48.294 --> 59:52.256
These three bumbling half-wits,
or the rising rebellion at our doorstep?

59:52.381 --> 59:56.302
Majesty, they say Sotiris, Captain of
Fourth Division, is back.

59:56.427 --> 59:57.845
He is leading the desertion.

59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.598
Father, I'll take responsibility for this.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:04.351
Let me find Sotiris.
I'll make him lead us to Hercules.

01:00:06.145 --> 01:00:10.149
When our allies from Egypt, Germania,
and the horn of Africa arrive tomorrow...

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:14.653
Sotiris, Hercules,
even Zeus himself will be but a memory.

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:21.201
What is this place?
- Captain Sotiris arranged it.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.379
This house will serve as safe haven,
it would appear.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.050
The woman inside says she knows you.

01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:39.136
She says she fled Argos
with the King's invasion.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.481
You swear to me this is
the second son of Alcmene...

01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:52.608
slain Queen of Tiryns?

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:55.611
Yes. Alcides.

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:59.490
Though he's known now to the people--
- As Hercules.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:03.118
Yes, I know. I was present for the naming.

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:19.218
My friend says you were of Argos
until my father brought his wrath upon it.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:22.763
Your father brought wrath upon many...

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.683
but Argos, that was a mortal's doing.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:30.062
Where have you brought me?
- To the truth, Hercules.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.064
To the truth of you.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:37.027
You may claim your bride and ride
a thousand days, it will not matter.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:41.281
Your destiny lies in something beyond.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:45.035
Yourjourney in life
will take you farther from love...

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.121
than you can imagine.

01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.875
My mother said that very thing...

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.669
the last day I set eyes on her.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:57.548
She was wise. But even she
did not understand the whole of it.

01:01:57.673 --> 01:02:00.843
You must accept who you are.

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:05.055
Only then can you unlock
the doors to your own potential.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.558
Embrace your father,
and you will discover...

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:09.643
powers that you never imagined.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:13.188
Where was this father when 80 good men
perished next to me?

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.817
Where was he when my mother
was murdered?

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:21.113
Your father has always been there,
Hercules.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.198
You were just not ready for him.

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.618
Zeus can't change the minds of mortals...

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:29.705
but he has given you a gift.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:33.375
And be warned,
abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.464
Respect it,
and it will save you and those you love.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:56.440
You will accept me... love me.

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:57.775
We will have children...

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.028
and you will love every one equally!

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:03.280
Won't you? Equally!

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.909
Iphicles.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.789
Restore me to my home.

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.750
Return me to my father.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.419
The gods do not want this marriage.

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:23.133
I do not want this marriage.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.385
Well, it Will be.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.807
Mark me, two moons hence.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.103
Or you may take your life, as well.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.801
Princess!

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.929
Princess.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.767
I cannot bear it, Chiron.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:16.353
I'm sick of living.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:18.522
The gods save me!

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:22.067
What would have happened had
I not just now returned?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.487
You were gone for days,
with not a word to me.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.448
I'm sorry, Princess.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.784
There was a reason.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:33.495
You say this to me...

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.999
as if I'm blind to the moon's phase.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.335
I know what's in store.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.797
No, you don't.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.405
It's me.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.240
It's me.

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:32.698
How did you keep it...

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:35.534
when you lost so much else?

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:41.873
Because losing this, I would've lost it all.

01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:50.340
It's mine! You gave it to me, yeah?

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:11.069
Is there still pain?
- Have no worry.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.331
Where should we go?

01:07:23.457 --> 01:07:25.667
No, not where. Doesn't matter where.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:29.755
Just that we go. And this time,
I shall escape him.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:40.974
We will be together...

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.769
but not in any foreign land.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.522
Not in Tyga.

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:50.400
But here...

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:53.111
in my homeland.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:14.674
Your Majesty,
I understand there's a small problem.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.261
Tell me, Tarak, did I not pay you
a sizeable amount of gold...

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:21.305
to kill every last man of those 80 men?

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.140
Yes, of course.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.310
Then how is it there is a survivor?

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:30.524
And not only Captain Sotiris,
but another man.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:34.653
A savior people call "Hercules".

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.113
He is rallying the villagers...

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:40.283
and even my own soldiers
against my rule.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.577
What are you going to do about it?

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:44.830
Answer me!

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:54.840
If, and I say, if this is true...

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:57.384
I will rectify this error.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.856
Darling flower, I missed you.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.524
And I hate to say it, but...

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.527
we need to leave now.

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:22.533
What is it? ls the bloom off
the rose so soon after my arrival?

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.505
Is this him?

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.216
Yes.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:43.305
How is it you survived?
No one survives those places.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.684
Hope.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:55.901
I was given hope.

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:01.740
Stop!

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.706
And what is your hope now,
Captain Sotiris?

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.423
That my son's life be spared.

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.012
Then take us to Hercules.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.583
Hercules.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:03.301
I didn't believe him.
And I'm not certain I do now.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:07.472
You... are Hercules.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:11.810
Take him away! Take Sotiris
and execute the others!

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.997
Stand aside for the King!

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:48.847
People of Tiryns,
I give you your mighty Hercules.

01:11:51.433 --> 01:11:54.019
He bleeds! And why?

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:57.772
Because he is nothing
more than an impostor!

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:02.902
A liar! A man of flesh and blood!

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:06.323
And what has this so-called
savior wrought?

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:10.160
Your farms lie untilled,
your villages lay burned...

01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:13.330
and your brothers rot dead in the fields!

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.041
Is this the message of hope?

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:24.049
So, self-proclaimed son of Zeus...

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.551
how will you offer these people
their salvation...

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.054
when you cannot even save yourself?

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.477
Bring out the other traitors!

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:43.485
Take me, but spare these good men!

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.196
He begs for mercy for his traitors!

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:49.866
Iphicles, your future king!

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:07.926
Strike this affliction from our lands forever.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:11.054
So that tonight we may celebrate...

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.681
as you wed the Princess of Crete!

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.355
Brother! Brother! Brother!

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:24.275
Chiron was there when you were born.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.568
You were sick.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.780
Kill him.
- My Prince.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.617
This life has not been wasted.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:37.080
I have had the honor to stand
by the greatest hero...

01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:40.750
the gods have ever given the people.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.840
Brother... please.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.274
Father!

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.652
I believe in you!

01:14:11.698 --> 01:14:14.576
Grant me strength!

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:28.631
Retreat!

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:34.012
Do something! Stop him!

01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:42.270
Commissionaires!
- Kill him!

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:52.799
Get up. Get up. Come on.

01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:09.232
We stand with you, my Prince, as do
the four divisions under our command.

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:12.151
The people are ready to lay
down their lives for you, Hercules.

01:16:12.277 --> 01:16:14.445
Lead us to victory!

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.764
Brave men of Tiryns!

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:44.892
I can only lead you through those gates!

01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:46.936
What our fate is beyond them, I cannot say.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:51.649
I only know what fate there is in retreat.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:55.278
Tonight we fight, not for what we have...

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:59.699
but for that which has been
so savagely ripped from our breast!

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.202
Alcides the Prince...

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:06.039
betrays his king...

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:11.753
but a son of Zeus takes
his first breath of life tonight...

01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:14.881
and fulfills his promise to his father.

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:19.344
Let this night be forever remembered...

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:21.346
as the hour upon which...

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.891
we took back our kingdom!

01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.467
There is my bride.

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:02.470
I declare to you that I love another.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:06.099
He's the reason I want to wake up
in the morning and embrace the day.

01:18:07.517 --> 01:18:12.230
If you so wound him that
his face were unrecognizable to me...

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:14.315
I would love him.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.070
If his tongue were cut from his throat
and I hadn't his voice to delight me...

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.614
I would love him.

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:27.453
And if you make only a memory of him...

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.249
I would love him even more eternally.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.921
That is what you have to look forward to.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:43.845
Halt in the name of the king!

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:46.013
Identify yourselves!

01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:49.767
You will be fired upon! Archers ready!

01:18:51.144 --> 01:18:52.478
Shields!

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:04.866
That is Sotiris and the men of the Fourth!
We were told they'd deserted!

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:07.827
Captain!
- Hold your fire!

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.831
I have taken arrows before!

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:16.335
If you fight to defend tyranny,
let them fly!

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:29.932
Men!

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:33.853
We take Tiryns! We take our lands!

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:49.118
Lower your aim!

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.132
Sotiris!

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.520
Fire!

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.736
We are with you, Hercules!

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.323
Forward!

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:51.055
King Amphitryon! Show yourself!

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.850
Where are you, you coward!

01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:56.227
Hiding with your Prince?

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:06.571
Hercules!
I apologize for the Prince...

01:21:06.696 --> 01:21:10.032
but he's about to consummate
his marriage to Queen Hebe...

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:13.327
the future wife of the next king of Tiryns!

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:16.706
And as for myself, well,
I come to welcome you home.

01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:20.459
As a matter of fact,
I have a little surprise for you.

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:33.180
Battle formation!

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:47.737
King Amphitryon,
my sword against yours!

01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:49.488
Victor takes all!

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:54.285
The city, its subjects, army, riches!

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.704
Not another soldier shall die!

01:21:56.829 --> 01:22:01.125
What say you, most brave
and merciful King of Tiryns?

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.586
Will you spare these men?

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:07.632
Imitation, the highest form of flattery.

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:10.259
Accept your destiny!

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:13.846
Cause I already rule it all, my son.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:16.807
I'm not your son, you murdering coward!

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.729
And the one who rules
it all is my TRUE father!

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:26.275
Lay down your weapons or prepare to die!

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:35.993
Tarak, kill the traitors!

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.578
Soldiers!

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:44.919
Prepare to...

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.586
Slaughter!

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:42.309
Have you come to bring
the wrath of Zeus upon me, boy!

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:46.480
No! I come to you as a mortal...

01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:49.275
to bring the wrath of Alcides...

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.986
upon the tyrant who killed my mother.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:57.283
Come at me, boy, and learn...

01:23:57.408 --> 01:24:00.244
why I am the slayer of kings!

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:01.787
Come!

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:24.935
Get up!

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:51.313
Brother! Release him!

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:54.358
Release him this moment, or I will kill her.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:59.613
My son...
you may not be a total loss after all.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:04.076
Alcides, I do not matter.

01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:05.870
Do you agree, brother?

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:10.082
Because as long as you can't have her,
she does not matter to me.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:14.962
And she's made it perfectly clear,
I do not matter to her.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.925
Brother, no!
- Release him!

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:24.180
We shall be together, my love.

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:33.856
No!

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:47.137
My love.

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:49.723
Do not fear.

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:53.227
I fear...

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:57.982
but one thing, I always have...

01:27:58.107 --> 01:28:02.111
your departure each and every time.

01:28:08.492 --> 01:28:11.912
I'm here now.
- This time, please stay.

01:28:13.247 --> 01:28:14.873
I promise.
