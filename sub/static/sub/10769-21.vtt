00:04.871 --> 00:05.929
Hey, Will.

00:06.106 --> 00:09.007
What's up? How come you're not dressed
for the golf tournament?

00:09.175 --> 00:10.437
I'm not playing this year.

00:11.811 --> 00:13.972
- Y'all play every year.
- Yeah, and every year we lose.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.081
Frankly, I'm sick of being a big loser.

00:17.050 --> 00:20.247
Come on, C, you're not big.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.344
Besides, I made other plans.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.389
I'm attending a seminar
on how to buy foreclosed properties.

00:25.558 --> 00:29.927
You wouldn't believe the money to be made
kicking people out of their own homes.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.759
Such a big heart for such a little man.

00:34.601 --> 00:39.436
Boy, I can't wait to hit those links.
Ha-ha-ha. How about you, partner?

00:39.606 --> 00:41.733
Bad news, big guy. I made other plans.

00:42.609 --> 00:43.837
Other plans?

00:44.010 --> 00:47.878
Carlton, this is a Banks' tradition.
With you going off to Princeton in the fall...

00:48.048 --> 00:51.108
...this is one of the last chances
we're gonna have to play golf...

00:51.284 --> 00:53.844
...and spend some quality time together.
- I'm sorry, big guy.

00:54.020 --> 00:59.151
Oh. Seem to me you gonna need somebody
to replace him, Uncle Phil.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.424
Right, right, right. But who?

01:02.595 --> 01:05.587
Ah. Fore. Uhn.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.731
Oh, Will, would you like to play?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.872
- Oh, me? No... Yes.
- Mm.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.003
Hi, guys.

01:15.175 --> 01:19.236
I'm in the golf tournament this year with
Uncle Phil, and we are definitely gonna win.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.410
Please, all you men think about is
win, win, win.

01:22.949 --> 01:27.648
Well, that's not exactly all we think about,
if you know what I'm talking about. Ha.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.948
You know what I'm saying, C?

01:30.123 --> 01:32.557
Yeah, yeah.

01:33.359 --> 01:35.350
Ashley's right. Take us for example.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.986
We enter the club tennis tournament
every year just for the fun of it.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.429
Just because we win,
doesn't make it any more fun.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.503
Exactly. Of course,
we don't have losing to compare it to.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.667
You go, girl.

01:51.878 --> 01:55.473
Well, Will, if we're gonna be partners,
we'd better get in some practice, huh?

01:55.648 --> 01:58.583
- Let's go to the club and hit a few balls.
- Right behind you.

01:58.751 --> 02:04.087
Will, Will. Listen, just out of curiosity,
what is the other thing men think about?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.045 --> 03:37.005
Oh, goody. I thought I was going
to run out of things to do today.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.518
Good God, Geoffrey, this place is a mess.

03:40.687 --> 03:44.384
Miss Hilary, it's comments like that,
that makes this job worthwhile.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.783
Geoffrey, Regis Philbin
is going to be here any minute.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.657
Ah. Another pair of hands
to lighten the load.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.798
This is important. Kathie Lee has the flu.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.491
He's looking for a co-host
while he's in Los Angeles.

03:55.668 --> 03:59.331
Whoa, that's a big deal, Hil.
Hey, anything I can do to help?

03:59.505 --> 04:00.938
Yeah. Don't talk to him.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.974
I don't want anyone to mess it up
by saying something stupid.

04:04.143 --> 04:07.112
It's going to be a very quiet meeting.

04:15.722 --> 04:19.158
Oh, pretty, pretty, please. Let me get it.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.955
Will, there is one thing you can do
to help me.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.860
- Oh, anything, Hil. Name it.
- Leave.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.967
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.100
Mr. Regis Philbin.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.911
Hilary.
Hilary, it's great to finally meet you.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.139
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Philbin.
- Please, call me Regis.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.840
Hey, what's up, Regis?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.077
You can call me Mr. Philbin.

04:47.253 --> 04:48.413
That's a joke.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.114
- I got him.
- I love this guy.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.984
Look, I'm on my way to the studio
so I'll cut right to the chase, Hilary.

04:56.162 --> 05:00.394
If you're available, we'd love for you
to substitute for Kathie Lee this week.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.466
- I'd love to. Thank you. Yes.
- Would you?

05:02.635 --> 05:05.536
Great. Listen, I gotta run
but I'll see you later at rehearsal.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.729
- Okay.
- Okay? Great.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.439
Listen, by the way,
try reversing your grip.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.013
It'll keep you from pushing the putt
to the right.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.412
Oh, I'll try it. Thanks a lot, Reg.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.480
Hey, don't ever call me Reg.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.159
Okay. Boy, you are so funny, Reg.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.094
No, I'm serious. Don't ever call me Reg.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.770
Well, if it isn't Martina and Steffi.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.234
How'd the first round
of your tournament go?

05:45.411 --> 05:48.676
Great. We won.
But then again, we always do.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.715
Yes. Black number five, coming up.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.712
"Black number five coming up. Ha-ha-ha."

05:57.890 --> 06:00.222
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Dude, I was just at the range.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.953
Man, I was El Kabong-ing
that joint a mile.

06:03.129 --> 06:06.394
And I'm gonna pretend I ain't see
that little dance you was just doing.

06:06.566 --> 06:07.897
Okay. Look, Will.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.898
I have to go to the pro shop
and pick up a sand wedge.

06:10.069 --> 06:14.199
What? A sandwich? Uncle Phil,
we just had breakfast a half hour ago.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.370
Will, I said "sand wedge." It's a club.

06:18.945 --> 06:23.006
Yeah, I know.
Turkey, bacon, three layers of white toast.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.484
- Banks.
- Mercer.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.280
Whoa, your son really shot up this year.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.016
This is my nephew.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.283
- Will, this is Bob Mercer.
- How you doing?

06:33.459 --> 06:35.689
- And his son, Bobby.
- What's up, man?

06:35.862 --> 06:38.160
They've been club champions
for three years.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.491
Four. Soon to be five.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.725
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.
I just bought a new set of clubs.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.632
Now you need somebody to swing them
for you and you could have a shot.

06:45.805 --> 06:50.504
Oh! Hey, Mercer, you should save
that dazzling wit for the courtroom.

06:50.676 --> 06:51.973
You might even win a case.

06:56.149 --> 07:00.245
So our makeup room is around the corner,
the control booth is upstairs...

07:00.420 --> 07:01.546
...and this is our set.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.588
Can I get you in your positions?
We wanna get a light reading.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.349
- Sure.
- Great.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.824
Oof.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.925
I hate to be a stickler,
but that's my chair.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.067
Oh, well, would you mind if I sat here?

07:15.234 --> 07:17.759
You see, my right side
has been rated my better side.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.599
So it'd be in my best interest
to be sitting on this side.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.365
It would be in my best interest...

07:22.542 --> 07:25.841
...if I could sit in the same chair
I've been sitting in for the last 15 years.

07:28.147 --> 07:29.842
Fine.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.084
Big baby.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.581
Well, now, we usually start off the show
by announcing our guests...

07:36.756 --> 07:39.554
...and then we have a little banter,
go to a commercial...

07:39.725 --> 07:41.215
...bring out the first guest.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.764
Well, that's a good way. But what if
we do it the way we do it on my show?

07:45.932 --> 07:50.335
Which is we bring out the guest first
and then we do that little banter thing later.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.404
Again, we've been using this format
for many, many years...

07:53.573 --> 07:55.541
...and it seems to work, you know?

07:55.708 --> 07:58.609
You know the old saying,
"If it ain't broke..."

07:58.811 --> 08:00.574
I'm drawing a blank here.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.946
Don't fix it.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.412
Fix what?

08:04.884 --> 08:05.908
It.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.178
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.084
What's it? What are you talking about?

08:11.257 --> 08:15.318
You know, maybe we'd better skip
the banter altogether, you know?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.463
Big baby.

08:22.602 --> 08:26.504
Oh, man.
That pro shot on 18 was something else.

08:26.672 --> 08:31.575
Hold up, I don't care what you say,
I ain't never seen a shot like you hit on 16.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.236
Sounds like you guys won.

08:34.413 --> 08:37.576
Hell, no, how could we?
He's an even worse golfer than you.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.677
So why are you so happy?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.947
Oh, we had a great time.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.182
- You had a great time losing?
- Yeah.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.795
I gotta tell you. We ain't spent quality time
like that together in years.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.489
Well, wait till tomorrow
when we really get our butts kicked.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.030
How about we throw a couple steaks
on the grill...

08:56.202 --> 08:58.397
...and discuss our losing strategy
for tomorrow?

08:58.571 --> 09:00.402
Great idea. I'll go start the barbie.

09:00.573 --> 09:03.474
Dad, you know, there's a chance
I may be free to play tomorrow.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.077
I wouldn't want you to miss
your foreclosure seminar.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.906
I really won't be missing that much.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.982
I mean, once the police come and toss
the family out, it's mostly paperwork.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.619
Well, Carlton, Will and I will be just fine.

09:15.021 --> 09:19.185
Let me tell you, this dude right here is just
straight loqued-out on a golf course, man.

09:19.358 --> 09:23.089
You are the one who managed to get the
golf cart up on two wheels, with me in it.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.991
That's no easy trick.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.691
Come on, you gotta show me how
you managed to miss those 1-foot putts.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.768
All you gotta do is not concentrate.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.263
- I ain't tripping.
- You crack me up.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.878
I can not concentrate.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.449
You ever done something
because you thought it was right...

09:49.622 --> 09:51.920
...but then felt really stupid
about what you did?

09:52.091 --> 09:55.060
Yes, but I'm still working here.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.854
I was talking about the golf tournament.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.295
I made other plans
because I didn't wanna play...

10:01.467 --> 10:03.799
...but then I saw Will and Dad
having so much fun...

10:03.970 --> 10:05.232
And now you're jealous.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.895
Now Will and Dad are buddies
and I feel like an idiot.

10:08.074 --> 10:11.305
Well, you shouldn't.
Not because of that anyway.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.678
Look...

10:14.947 --> 10:18.110
...everyone makes mistakes.
The point is to learn from them.

10:18.284 --> 10:24.018
And most important, not to try to solve
your problems with hasty immature actions.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.626
Hey, man,
look what happened to my golf clubs.

10:30.529 --> 10:34.761
Bet it was that dirty boy Bobby Mercer.
You know, it's always the quiet ones.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.267
Will. Will. Are you ready to go?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.497
- What happened?
- Hey, man, I don't know.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.370
I guess there's only one solution.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.876
- I'll get my clubs.
- Great. You can play with Carlton's clubs.

10:48.047 --> 10:51.642
Wait, Carl...?
What, I'm supposed to play on my knees?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.982
I guess you're stuck then.
Never fear, Carlton Banks is here.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.122
I'll change my plans
and take Will's place.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.189
I don't want you to miss your seminar.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.826
- No, no, no, I don't mind.
- No, I have a better idea.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.291
I'll just buy you a new set.

11:03.462 --> 11:07.057
You're gonna need them because we're
gonna be playing a lot of golf together.

11:07.433 --> 11:11.665
Why not? I guess I can play just as bad with
the news ones as I did with the old ones.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.498
- Maybe worse.
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.834
Shoot, with my swing,
I might as well play with these.

11:20.546 --> 11:25.210
- Geoffrey, would you mind?
- Oh, I suppose not, Master Carlton.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.918
You know, Regis,
I know we've already covered this ground...

11:34.093 --> 11:36.084
...but I'd really like to sit on that side.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.254
Hilary, Hilary. Relax, you look great.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.230
The show is gonna be great
regardless of where we sit.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.369
Let's just do the show
and forget about it.

11:44.537 --> 11:49.474
Counting. In, five, four, three, two...

11:49.642 --> 11:51.633
<i>Hi, everybody.
Welcome to Live With Regis...</i>

11:51.811 --> 11:55.508
...and my guest host for today,
Ms. Hilary Banks.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.013
- Thank you for having me.
- The pleasure's all mine.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.516
- We're gonna have a great show today.
- We sure are.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.417
Today on the show,
we have ghostbuster Ernie Hudson.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.518
- And direct from Milan, we have...
- Hilary, Hilary.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.422
I usually announce the guests.

12:09.595 --> 12:10.687
Oh, well, then go ahead.

12:10.863 --> 12:14.026
And direct from Milan, one
of the preeminent fashion designers...

12:14.200 --> 12:16.225
...Miss Isabella Fonte.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.098
Now, what is the deal
with your Los Angeles freeways?

12:19.271 --> 12:20.738
I'm driving down the San Diego...

12:20.906 --> 12:23.534
Tell me about it.
I'm driving along, 90 miles per hour...

12:23.709 --> 12:26.041
...I'm putting my makeup on
when the phone rings...

12:26.212 --> 12:29.272
...and I spill my Frappuccino
all over my Louis Vuitton sports bag.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.042
- Hilary. Hilary, what are you doing?
- I'm bantering.

12:32.218 --> 12:36.120
- It takes two people to banter.
- Not when I do it.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.421
What do you say we bring out our guest?

12:39.592 --> 12:43.688
A woman who defines fashion,
Miss Isabella Fonte, ladies and gentlemen.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.627
- Yes. Hi, Isabella. How are you?
- Good.

12:46.799 --> 12:50.701
Nice to have you. Have a seat right here.
It's so good to see you.

12:50.870 --> 12:51.859
Ha!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.968
- Mom?
- Ash, honey, a quick tip.

12:56.142 --> 13:01.239
When that little round yellow fuzzy thing
comes at you, take a swipe at it.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.938
I'm sorry, Mom.
I guess I couldn't hear it coming.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.914
Your outfit was too loud.

13:07.353 --> 13:11.517
Ladies, ladies,
whatever happened to teamwork?

13:11.857 --> 13:15.315
- Ashley, you're my daughter and I love you.
- That's better.

13:15.494 --> 13:19.863
But if you double fault one more time,
I am going to put you up for adoption.

13:20.933 --> 13:25.427
Great, maybe then I'll wind up with
a mother who can hit a decent backhand.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.338
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.999
Well, let me say it louder then.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.746
I'm gonna grab us some water,
you go grab the cart.

13:37.917 --> 13:38.941
- Okay.
- All right.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.380
Will.
- Hey, Mr. Jenkins.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.953
Remember, you promised
you were gonna meet my daughter.

13:43.122 --> 13:46.216
Oh, yeah, that's cool, man. As long as
she ain't got a forehead like her daddy.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.657
- That's a good one.
- Okay.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.631
He told me he didn't have any children.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.469
Hey, hey, Rich, Rich, Rich, I still owe you
a couple bucks for them golf balls.

14:00.639 --> 14:04.006
Your money's no good here, Will.
Now, put that away.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.302
Carlton, you still owe me
for those Milk Duds.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.348
Carlton, what you doing here?

14:11.517 --> 14:14.077
I thought if you didn't wanna play,
I'd fill in for you.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.153
No, I'm kind of getting the hang of this.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.756
Looks like you and Dad
have been having lots of fun.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.222
We having a ball.
I really need to get out there.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.953
- You sure you don't want me to play?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:24.129 --> 14:27.826
- Will.
- Carlton, I'm playing.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.300
Hey, Banks, why don't we save ourselves
a lot of trouble?

14:36.475 --> 14:39.467
We'll walk over to the 18th hole
and you can just hand me the trophy.

14:39.645 --> 14:44.673
Ha-ha-ha. You keep talking, Mercer,
and I'm gonna hand you something else.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.481
Whoo!

14:55.160 --> 15:00.223
I'm sorry... I got this thing that every,
you know... just once in a while I...

16:40.933 --> 16:43.800
- Will? Now, we're doing great.
- Right.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.335
We're down four strokes
with nine holes to go.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.973
- I know it's not about winning or losing...
- No, no.

16:49.141 --> 16:53.043
- but if you help me beat them, you'll never
have to work another day in your life.

16:53.212 --> 16:56.079
- Really?
- Well, no, but I'll buy you dinner.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.207
All right, cool.
I'm gonna grab us a couple sodas, man.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.479
- I'll meet you on the tenth.
- Okay. Okay, good.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.021
Carlton, what are you still doing here?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.954
I wanna play, Will, please.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.426
I wanna be a big loser
and have fun like you and Dad.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.031
- Wait, I can't just quit now.
- No, no, sure you can.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.327
Come on,
now help me put your clubs in the car.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.698
Look, Carlton, no.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.104
Look, I made a big mistake
not playing in this tournament.

17:24.276 --> 17:27.939
- You said you didn't even wanna play.
- I know, but I see you guys having fun...

17:28.113 --> 17:31.207
...and I realize Dad was right.
With me going to Princeton...

17:31.383 --> 17:34.910
...we won't have plenty of chances left
to spend quality time together.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.079
The time on the course
wasn't about winning or losing...

17:38.257 --> 17:40.316
...it was about me being with my dad.

17:42.327 --> 17:45.763
Um...
Guess I ain't think about it like that.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.592
So you gonna let me play?

17:48.233 --> 17:51.430
No, but we need a couple sodas,
why don't you bring them out?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.437
- All right, come on, Will, you're up.
- Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Uncle Phil.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.134
Whew.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.913
- Got your sodas.
- Oh.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.451
Hey, thanks a lot, C. I'll grab them from you
as soon as I bust this joint.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.164
I think I pulled my hamstring.

18:28.340 --> 18:33.334
Will. Will, how can you pull a hamstring
playing golf?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.441
I mean... Ow!

18:36.615 --> 18:40.016
My shoulder string.

18:40.252 --> 18:43.983
Uh-oh.
An injury to a player could mean a forfeit.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.986
Oh, it hurts real bad, Uncle Phil.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.186
Well, that's okay, son. Maybe next year.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.955
Ow.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.426
But wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, Carlton, come here.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.830
Maybe you could bail me out.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.872
I don't know. What do you think, Dad?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.032
What do I think?

19:07.813 --> 19:10.373
Grab your club, son.
If you help me win this thing...

19:10.549 --> 19:13.882
...you'll never have to work another day
in your life. But you have fun.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.628
If I make this putt, we win.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.530
Carlton, whether we make this putt or not,
it's been a great afternoon.

19:31.870 --> 19:35.533
- How about if I just blow it?
- No, I think you should try to make it.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.232
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
But it doesn't matter, right?

19:38.410 --> 19:41.504
- Carlton, will you just putt?
- Okay. Okay.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.650
You got it, boy. I'm telling you...
- Will, would you just let him putt?

19:51.823 --> 19:53.916
- All right, my bad.
- Thank you.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.292
Oh, man, that was great.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.452
Carlton, I gotta give you props.
You dropped that putt from deep.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.565
Thanks, Will. How about I come back
every year from Princeton...

20:34.733 --> 20:37.327
...to play in the golf tournament?
- Oh, I'd love it.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.470
How about I come back
from wherever I'm at?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.162
Why?

20:42.007 --> 20:43.702
No reason.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.433
Listen, I'm gonna go put this
in the pool house.

20:48.347 --> 20:52.681
- I mean, on the mantel in the library.
- Ah.

20:53.518 --> 20:57.852
So, Will,
how is that shoulder-string thing?

20:58.023 --> 21:02.084
Ooh, ah. Man, yeah. You know,
I need to go get something to rub on it.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.320
Maybe you should. Will?

21:05.330 --> 21:09.164
I know what you did for your cousin,
and I'm glad you did it.

21:09.334 --> 21:10.596
Thank you.

21:11.236 --> 21:15.104
Oh. You're welcome, Uncle Phil.
Hey, I still get that dinner, right?

21:15.507 --> 21:17.270
Yes, Will.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.910
- Bring your Platinum card, boy.
- Oh, good.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.414
Hey, what's up, Hil?
How'd it go with Reg?

21:23.582 --> 21:27.348
Regis loves me for finally bringing
a little flavor to the show.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.180
The promo's about to come on.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.323
