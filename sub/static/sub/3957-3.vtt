So long as you live under
my roof, you live by my rules.

00:06.579 --> 00:09.139
He kissed me! So he must like me.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.296
I've just seen Archie.
He ain't coming.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.680
Just leave me alone.

00:12.681 --> 00:15.680
I knew you couldn't
possibly like me!

00:15.778 --> 00:18.098
I think he's a dick for what he did.

00:18.099 --> 00:19.978
Wow!

'When you've lived in
someone's shadow for a long time,

00:39.308 --> 00:40.948
'you kind of get used to it.'

00:40.949 --> 00:42.728
Come on, Rae!

00:42.768 --> 00:44.487
'You have to...

00:44.488 --> 00:47.508
'especially when
it's someone so perfect

00:47.547 --> 00:49.626
'and so beautiful.

'You accept that some birds
are high-flying birds...

00:53.307 --> 00:55.506
'and other birds are not.

'But that doesn't mean
they can't fly together.'

01:11.873 --> 01:13.873
Oh, he got it that time, didn't he?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.960
Being back at school on the summer
holidays is just wrong, innit?

01:17.961 --> 01:21.040
Yeah, but we need to
support Chlo, don't we?

01:21.126 --> 01:22.485
Come on, Chlo!

01:22.486 --> 01:23.666
- Whoo!
- Come on, Chlo!

01:23.721 --> 01:24.661
You can do it!

01:24.664 --> 01:25.644
Come on, girl! Yeah!

01:25.736 --> 01:28.294
I'm telling you, it's him,
it's Michael Price.

01:28.295 --> 01:32.296
He is nowhere near good-looking
enough to be going out with Chloe.

01:32.576 --> 01:34.654
I mean, look at the state
of her. She's well hot.

01:34.655 --> 01:36.694
Rae, you're supposed
to be Chloe's best mate.

01:36.695 --> 01:39.016
How do you not know
who she's sleeping with?

01:39.017 --> 01:40.575
Whoo! Come on, Chloe!

01:40.576 --> 01:41.176
Come on, Chlo!

01:41.177 --> 01:42.295
Come on, Chlo!

01:42.296 --> 01:44.216
You can do it!

01:44.348 --> 01:47.627
'All eyes on
the lovely Chloe as usual.

01:47.628 --> 01:50.227
'What I wasn't telling them

01:50.228 --> 01:53.488
'was that my secret
boyfriend was there as well.

'Mr Carrisford,

'..in my mind.'

02:09.874 --> 02:11.993
Rae.

02:11.994 --> 02:14.233
I didn't think you'd...

02:14.234 --> 02:16.514
come.

02:21.594 --> 02:23.953
What's with all the Caramacs?

02:23.954 --> 02:25.153
Shh!

02:25.154 --> 02:29.154
You shut your pretty mouth
and start opening them.

02:38.234 --> 02:41.993
'Finn had a point -
why hadn't Chloe told me?

02:41.994 --> 02:44.754

best friends again.

'We were supposed to

that she'd made the whole thing up.

'That actually, in real life,

'she stayed up all night
fantasising like the rest of us.'

03:00.874 --> 03:04.874
Oh, hi, Mr Carrisford.

03:57.213 --> 03:58.572
Are you still here?

03:58.573 --> 04:01.453
'Why can't I get noticed
by boys in real life,

04:01.474 --> 04:05.474
'but Chloe is even sleeping with
men from my wildest fantasies?

'Worst summer holiday ever.'

04:10.594 --> 04:14.192
Raemundo! This is Little Al.
You know Barney and Lizard.

04:14.193 --> 04:17.113
Listen, I want to
chat to you about Saturday.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.392
What's Saturday?

04:18.394 --> 04:19.833
Oasis. Knebworth.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.952
I don't want to talk about it.

04:21.954 --> 04:22.834
The lads got tickets!

04:22.835 --> 04:24.193
What?

04:24.194 --> 04:25.433
Lucky bastards!

04:25.434 --> 04:29.273
You mean...
you're all actually going?

04:29.274 --> 04:30.914
We didn't know what to say.

04:30.915 --> 04:32.433
Sorry.

04:32.434 --> 04:34.713
Well, it's...

04:34.714 --> 04:36.074
not that big a deal.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.073
So... you don't want this, then?

04:39.074 --> 04:41.673
I've got one spare.

04:41.674 --> 04:42.874
Are you messing with me?

04:42.875 --> 04:46.113
I'm not messing with you.

04:46.114 --> 04:46.914
Don't mess with me.

04:46.915 --> 04:48.874
I'm not! It's real.

04:50.954 --> 04:53.794
Oh, Chop!

05:07.434 --> 05:11.434
Oh, this is the best
summer holiday ever. Archie!

05:12.354 --> 05:13.913
Yes.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.553
Chop!

05:14.554 --> 05:15.633
My dear!

05:15.634 --> 05:19.634
Oh, yeah!

05:20.434 --> 05:22.753
You excited about Knebworth, then?

05:22.754 --> 05:24.953
Suppose so.

05:24.954 --> 05:27.473
'How can I have ever fantasised

05:27.474 --> 05:31.313
'about sleeping with
someone so utterly annoying?

05:31.314 --> 05:33.113
'Yeah, he was stunning...

05:33.114 --> 05:37.114
'With an arse that I just wanted
to bite into like a violent dog,

05:38.034 --> 05:41.234
'but he was so big-headed,
so miserable, so self...'

05:41.235 --> 05:43.873
Stop staring at me.
It freaks me out.

05:43.874 --> 05:45.753
I'm not staring at you.

05:45.754 --> 05:48.913
Right, whatever.

05:48.914 --> 05:50.993
So, Mr Choppy Chop...

05:50.994 --> 05:51.713
Hello.

05:51.714 --> 05:54.392
Why I am going
and not Chloe or Izzy?

05:54.393 --> 05:56.712
Didn't ask them.
You was first choice.

05:56.713 --> 05:58.552
Well, it's kind of
a lads' trip only.

05:58.553 --> 06:00.192
But we see you as
one of the lads anyway,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.552
so obviously we knew you
weren't going to be a problem.

06:02.553 --> 06:04.552
Do you know what I mean?
So we just carried on.

06:04.553 --> 06:07.312
'But we
see you as one of the lads anyway.

06:07.313 --> 06:09.192
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway.

06:09.193 --> 06:12.074
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway...'

06:12.075 --> 06:16.074
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway...'

06:27.754 --> 06:31.754
Rae, we need to talk.

06:33.194 --> 06:35.714
You know I wanted to
talk to you earlier, but...

06:35.715 --> 06:39.714
well, you've been busy with
the boys all evening, so...

06:41.954 --> 06:44.713
Are you going to tell anyone, Rae?

06:44.714 --> 06:47.273
Why would I tell anyone?

06:47.274 --> 06:48.793
Don't know.

06:48.794 --> 06:52.673
Chloe, what are you thinking?!

06:52.674 --> 06:54.794
He's a teacher. It's just wrong.

06:54.795 --> 06:58.073
How can you say that?

06:58.074 --> 07:01.592
You know, the other day, you said,
"I'll sex him into a coma so deep

07:01.593 --> 07:03.992
"the only way he'd wake up
was if I sexed him some more."

07:03.993 --> 07:06.994
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'd
actually do anything in real life.

07:06.995 --> 07:08.873
Oh, right. OK, then.

07:08.874 --> 07:12.593
Chloe, he's clearly
taking advantage of you.

07:12.594 --> 07:16.353
No! You know nothing about us.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.593
You know, cos...

07:18.594 --> 07:20.074
well, we trust each other.

07:20.075 --> 07:21.513
Yeah, right.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.633
Oh, I'm sorry, Rae, I forgot...

07:23.634 --> 07:25.832
cos you're the expert
on love, aren't ya?

07:25.833 --> 07:28.032
Cos how many boys is it
you've kissed again?

07:28.033 --> 07:29.712
I'd rather have only kissed one boy

07:29.713 --> 07:32.114
than give
mouth-to-south resuscitation

07:32.115 --> 07:33.833
to someone twice my age

07:33.834 --> 07:37.232
in a Vauxhall Nova on a bit
of scrubland behind a SPAR.

07:37.233 --> 07:41.234
Don't make me feel bad just cos I've
got a boyfriend and you haven't.

07:42.474 --> 07:46.474
Do you know, you're always making me
feel guilty for having things.

07:47.874 --> 07:51.632
You think I've got it so easy,
Rae, and you've got no idea

07:51.633 --> 07:53.752
what it's like to have
to walk into a room

07:53.753 --> 07:55.434
and have everyone look at you.

07:55.435 --> 07:57.193
All of the time.

07:57.194 --> 08:00.193
I do know what it feels like...

08:00.194 --> 08:04.194
to walk into a room and
have everybody stare at me.

08:05.994 --> 08:09.994
Do you know that every time
we talk to boys...

08:12.234 --> 08:15.514
they're not talking to us,
they're talking to you?

08:15.515 --> 08:16.913
Whatever, Rae!

08:16.914 --> 08:19.433
Oh, no.

08:19.434 --> 08:23.353
Of course you don't, Princess Chloe.

08:23.354 --> 08:26.873
So don't you dare
sit there and tell me

08:26.874 --> 08:30.874
how difficult you've got it.

08:31.514 --> 08:32.873
You're just a...

08:32.874 --> 08:36.874
I'm a what?

08:37.274 --> 08:38.993
Nothing.

08:38.994 --> 08:41.673
Go on.

08:41.674 --> 08:45.674
Say it.

08:50.154 --> 08:54.154
Chloe, you're a really shit friend.

08:58.714 --> 09:02.714
Sometimes.

09:08.914 --> 09:11.834
Well, if that's the way
you feel, maybe...

09:11.835 --> 09:15.834
we shouldn't be friends.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.433
Fine.

09:21.434 --> 09:23.273
Coo-ee!

09:23.274 --> 09:26.313
Found you, sneaky sneakies!

09:26.314 --> 09:30.314
We're moving on to The Basement.
Get a wriggle on.

09:30.914 --> 09:34.914
Rae's not coming.

09:34.994 --> 09:38.994
She doesn't feel well.

09:45.914 --> 09:47.450
You all right?

10:02.991 --> 10:05.951
You're gonna say that I'm angry
because I'm jealous.

10:06.016 --> 10:08.016
Well, yeah, I am jealous.

10:08.037 --> 10:10.476
I'm jealous because she's pretty.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.635
I'm jealous because she's good
at things.

10:12.636 --> 10:15.915
I'm jealous because she's slight
but curvy. Clever. Sporty.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.477
I'm jealous
because she's Grade 4 on the cello,

10:18.572 --> 10:21.570
because she volunteers
at an outreach centre.

10:21.571 --> 10:23.730
I'm jealous
because she's the type of girl

10:23.731 --> 10:26.752
who will one day appear on the cover
of Marie Claire

10:26.830 --> 10:28.349
sunbathing on a yacht.

10:28.350 --> 10:31.770
I'm jealous
just because of the way she is.

10:31.782 --> 10:33.181
Because she...

10:33.182 --> 10:35.301
well, she...

10:35.302 --> 10:37.741
she is like...

10:37.742 --> 10:41.742
a girl.

10:42.022 --> 10:43.580
Why are you friends with Chloe?

10:43.581 --> 10:46.820
Because we've always been friends.
That's the reason.

10:46.821 --> 10:48.940
You have those friends,
and you think,

10:48.941 --> 10:52.260
well... if I met you now...
well, I wouldn't even talk to you.

10:52.261 --> 10:54.702
But because we've known each other
for such a long time,

10:54.703 --> 10:58.702
because we've got a history...

10:59.182 --> 11:01.782
I've always been in her shadow
and I'm just...

11:01.783 --> 11:04.701
I'm sick of it now.

11:04.702 --> 11:08.702
But why now? I mean, what's changed?

11:09.182 --> 11:11.700
All those qualities
that you see in Chloe...

11:11.701 --> 11:13.700
you don't see any of those in
yourself?

11:13.701 --> 11:15.462
Well, I'm definitely not girly.

11:15.463 --> 11:17.301
Why do you say that?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.741
My nickname is Raemundo.

11:19.742 --> 11:21.861
I drink pints. I swear.

11:21.862 --> 11:23.781
I'm loud. I tell jokes.

11:23.782 --> 11:26.541
What's not girly about telling
jokes?

11:26.542 --> 11:30.021
Oh, because telling jokes is a boy
thing.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.660
And boys don't like it
when girls tell jokes,

11:32.661 --> 11:34.740
because it freaks them out
to think that a girl

11:34.741 --> 11:37.462
might actually be funnier
than what they are.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.261
Oh!

11:39.262 --> 11:43.262
So it's actually... about boys?

11:43.822 --> 11:47.822
Boys decide whether
you are girly or not?

11:50.342 --> 11:54.342
I find you intensely irritating
some days.

11:55.302 --> 11:57.781
It's what I live for.

11:57.782 --> 12:01.382
Maybe your relationship has changed,
at least in part,

12:01.383 --> 12:04.901
because your relationship with men
has changed.

12:04.902 --> 12:07.020
And because you're part
of a group now,

12:07.021 --> 12:09.780
maybe you and Chloe are just trying
to figure out, you know,

12:09.781 --> 12:12.500
how your friendship works
now that things are different.

12:12.501 --> 12:14.422
Well, how do I figure that out?

12:14.423 --> 12:17.621
Well, you need to think, um...

12:17.622 --> 12:19.180
is there more to this relationship

12:19.181 --> 12:21.300
than having known each other
for ages?

12:21.301 --> 12:25.222
You need to think how you'd feel if
Chloe was no longer in your life.

12:25.223 --> 12:28.981
Would you miss her?
I doubt it.

12:28.982 --> 12:32.982
You honestly don't think
you'd miss her?

12:33.542 --> 12:35.821
Come on, Rae...

12:35.822 --> 12:38.221
we're making progress here.

12:38.222 --> 12:39.942
Engage with me.
It's not that.

12:39.943 --> 12:43.301
What? Then what is it?

12:43.302 --> 12:45.221
I think I'm having a period.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.181
Tuesday, 16th August.

12:47.182 --> 12:49.021
Well done, that day!

12:49.022 --> 12:51.022
The first sign of womanhood
for 18 months.

12:51.023 --> 12:53.581
I must have lost weight.

12:53.582 --> 12:57.181
My GP said that's probably
why they stopped.

12:57.182 --> 13:00.262
I'm so pleased for you, Rae.
What does it feel like?

13:00.263 --> 13:04.262
It feels like a tiny little bastard
is punching me

13:04.702 --> 13:07.941
in the small of my back.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.501
Aw...

13:09.502 --> 13:11.901
Sandra the sanitary towel.

13:11.902 --> 13:15.381
It's finally time for her
to fulfil her destiny.

13:15.382 --> 13:18.861
I'm actually a woman, Tix -
this proves it.

13:18.862 --> 13:22.862
Now all I have to do is prove it
to the boys at Knebworth.

13:23.182 --> 13:25.341
I need to look hot.

13:25.342 --> 13:27.821
Why don't you just buy a dress?

13:27.822 --> 13:30.742
I think, as a boy, that's what
we think of as being pretty girly.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.101
Danny?!

13:32.102 --> 13:33.141
Yo.

13:33.142 --> 13:35.060
What the hell are you doing in here?!

13:35.061 --> 13:36.820
The men's was out of order.

13:36.821 --> 13:38.620
Look, it doesn't even have to be
a dress -

13:38.621 --> 13:40.980
it could be like something
a bit more... fashiony, you know?

13:40.981 --> 13:42.820
Something a bit like a...
Danny, get out!

13:42.821 --> 13:44.702
Yeah... out! Hurry up and get out.

13:44.703 --> 13:48.702
I'm going.
It's the ladies!

13:51.342 --> 13:53.182
Why didn't we think of that?

14:37.262 --> 14:38.342
Nice!

14:57.262 --> 15:00.781
The key to getting anything off my
mum was timing.

15:00.782 --> 15:03.822
Ask her for anything
when she's in a good mood

15:03.823 --> 15:06.061
and you're guaranteed success.

15:06.062 --> 15:10.062
Things weren't looking good.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.701
New regime?

15:13.702 --> 15:16.261
Russian Peasant diet.

15:16.262 --> 15:20.262
Only fucking liquids
for the next four days.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.342
I'm eating a bowl of vegetable stock
for my dinner.

15:23.343 --> 15:24.901
Mmm...

15:24.902 --> 15:28.781
Smells good.

15:28.782 --> 15:30.421
I was thinking

15:30.422 --> 15:32.501
that it might be nice

15:32.502 --> 15:34.020
if I got some new clothes.
How much?

15:34.021 --> 15:37.382
Well, there's this company that do,
like, tailor-made stuff...

15:37.383 --> 15:40.381
How much?

15:40.382 --> 15:41.781
95 quid.

15:41.782 --> 15:43.022
You think I was born yesterday

15:43.023 --> 15:46.942
floating down the river
on a banana boat? No chance.

15:48.222 --> 15:51.820
I can't find anything that fits me
in a normal shop!

15:51.821 --> 15:53.982
Why don't you borrow
something of mine?

15:53.983 --> 15:57.982
Because I'd rather die.

16:00.262 --> 16:02.061
This isn't fair!

16:02.062 --> 16:04.620
Everyone else gets money
off their parents!

16:04.621 --> 16:08.622
But no, I've got to live in a house
that doesn't even stock tampons!

16:09.462 --> 16:11.061
Do you know what, Mum?

16:11.062 --> 16:15.062
Value sanitary towels are a crime
against my femininity.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.421
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Ms Pankhurst,

16:18.422 --> 16:20.620
next time I go to the supermarket,

16:20.621 --> 16:24.340
I'll buy you a bag of swans' necks
and you can use those.

16:24.341 --> 16:27.222
Besides, you only started your
period again today, so, you know,

16:27.223 --> 16:31.222
let's not pretend we're experts.

16:55.142 --> 16:59.142
All right!

17:00.622 --> 17:03.581
Fucking typical!

17:03.582 --> 17:07.582
Well, can I come in?

17:15.061 --> 17:17.662
So how was The Basement
the other night?

17:17.663 --> 17:21.340
It was all right.

17:21.342 --> 17:25.342
Look, this is some of the stuff
that you left at mine.

17:27.182 --> 17:31.182
I thought I'd bring it round
for you.

17:32.822 --> 17:36.422
Rae, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

17:36.423 --> 17:40.422
Well, I didn't know
where else to go, because...

17:40.742 --> 17:42.582
you're the only one
who knows about Stephen.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.301
Who's the fuck's Stephen?

17:44.302 --> 17:46.221
Mr Carrisford!

17:46.222 --> 17:48.981
Oh...

17:48.982 --> 17:50.701
Right.

17:50.702 --> 17:53.421
So has he broken up with you, then?

17:53.422 --> 17:55.781
He was just a boyfriend.

17:55.782 --> 17:58.022
I think it's probably for the best,

17:58.023 --> 18:02.022
because it wasn't right...
you and him...

18:02.222 --> 18:04.221
going out with each other.

18:04.222 --> 18:08.222
Yeah, well, he hasn't broken up
with me!

18:11.982 --> 18:15.982
I'm pregnant!

18:18.822 --> 18:22.822
Fucking hell.

18:23.622 --> 18:25.341
Well...

18:25.342 --> 18:27.141
say something, Rae!

18:27.142 --> 18:29.021
Fucking hell!

18:29.022 --> 18:30.902
I thought you were on the pill!

18:30.903 --> 18:33.101
Yeah, well, I stopped taking it.

18:33.102 --> 18:36.581
Why?

18:36.582 --> 18:39.500
The packet said
it could make you put on weight.

18:39.501 --> 18:42.420
So rather than just put on
a little bit of weight,

18:42.421 --> 18:45.900
you thought that you would risk
getting knocked up?!

18:45.901 --> 18:48.422
Yeah, do you know,
that's exactly what I thought!

18:48.423 --> 18:50.781
Uh...! You know what, Chloe?

18:50.782 --> 18:54.100
Most pregnant women,
well, they put on at least...

18:54.101 --> 18:55.140
one, two, three...

18:55.141 --> 18:56.900
Yeah, I get the irony of it, Rae!

18:56.901 --> 18:59.182
Rae, if you want your jeans washing
inside out,

18:59.183 --> 19:02.862
put them in the basket
in... side... out!

19:05.982 --> 19:09.701
So what are you gonna do about it,
then?

19:09.702 --> 19:11.861
Are you gonna tell Mr Car...

19:11.862 --> 19:13.101
Stephen?

19:13.102 --> 19:15.501
No.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.782
It would ruin everything.

19:16.783 --> 19:18.261
I think you should.

19:18.262 --> 19:20.580
Yeah, well,
you don't know him, Rae.

19:20.581 --> 19:22.442
You're the one that said
you trust each other.

19:22.466 --> 19:24.024
Don't have a go at me!

19:24.102 --> 19:28.102
I'm not having a go at you.

19:29.462 --> 19:33.462
Do you know, my mum...

19:33.542 --> 19:37.542
I remember she told me ages ago
she got pregnant when she was young.

19:39.022 --> 19:42.421
She said it stays with you.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.102
Whether you have it or not.

19:44.103 --> 19:48.102
You know, whatever decision you
make, it's for ever.

19:48.422 --> 19:52.422
She'd be so disappointed
if she knew about this.

19:59.982 --> 20:03.982
I've got an appointment at
the clinic on Thursday.

20:06.582 --> 20:09.022
Will you come with me?
You don't have to.

20:09.023 --> 20:09.861
It's fine.

20:09.862 --> 20:12.421
Chloe...

20:12.422 --> 20:15.941
I'll come with you.

20:15.942 --> 20:19.942
OK.

20:23.702 --> 20:27.702
I'll see you later.

20:28.702 --> 20:30.101
It's bad.

20:30.102 --> 20:32.381
OK, it's really bad,

20:32.382 --> 20:36.141
but this was typical of Chloe!
I have my first kiss,

20:36.142 --> 20:37.821
she loses her virginity.

20:37.822 --> 20:39.621
I get my period back,

20:39.622 --> 20:41.141
and she gets pregnant!

20:41.142 --> 20:42.940
If I went to Butlin's on holiday,

20:42.941 --> 20:45.182
she'd probably go to Disneyland...

20:45.183 --> 20:47.301
on the bloody moon.

20:47.302 --> 20:51.302
I hate myself for thinking that.

20:52.302 --> 20:54.661
God...

20:54.662 --> 20:56.621
Please... please... please...

20:56.622 --> 20:58.061
Oh, God.
Oh, Jabba!

20:58.062 --> 20:59.261
Oh, fuck!

20:59.262 --> 21:00.301
Jabba!

21:00.302 --> 21:01.622
'The Green Lane Gang.

21:01.623 --> 21:04.101

'Twat, twat, twat.'

22:35.765 --> 22:37.404
Are you all right?

22:37.405 --> 22:39.044
Yeah. Why?

22:39.045 --> 22:42.205
Me and Karim barely saw you
yesterday, did we?

22:42.206 --> 22:44.484
Mmm.
What's going on?

22:44.485 --> 22:45.705
Nothing.

22:45.738 --> 22:48.138
'..And reassess how they're going to
try and plot a way

22:48.139 --> 22:50.777

22:50.778 --> 22:52.737
Should I ring Kester?

22:52.738 --> 22:56.738
What? No! I'm fine.

23:05.612 --> 23:06.891
Mum...

23:06.892 --> 23:10.171
is there such thing as a mega period?

23:10.172 --> 23:11.931
Mega?

23:11.932 --> 23:15.251
Well, maybe you should go
and see Dr Nick?

23:15.252 --> 23:18.532
You can't just nip in and see
Dr Nick. He's not a normal GP.

23:18.533 --> 23:21.891
Why not? He's been your doctor for
four months.

23:21.892 --> 23:23.530
Sorting out your pills and your
diet.

23:23.531 --> 23:24.772
Why can't you talk to him
about this?

23:24.834 --> 23:26.833
Because no, all right?

23:26.834 --> 23:28.672
Oh, I'll just get his number
from the phone book.

23:28.673 --> 23:32.674
There is no way I'm talking to
Dr Nick about my mega period!

23:33.474 --> 23:37.354
'Just another chapter of humiliation
in the multi-volumed anthology

23:37.416 --> 23:41.416

with that paperweight,

23:47.921 --> 23:51.922
'I could lick him all over
before he regained consciousness.'

23:53.682 --> 23:57.361
OK. Jump up on the bed
so I can have a look at you.

23:57.362 --> 23:58.921
'Oh, God.

23:58.922 --> 24:01.041

'I can't...

24:12.522 --> 24:15.921

24:15.922 --> 24:19.922
Run! It's the mega period!

24:22.082 --> 24:23.522
So how's everything going?

24:23.523 --> 24:25.401
OK.
Good.

24:25.402 --> 24:27.001
You got enough meds?

24:27.002 --> 24:31.002
Yeah.

24:31.322 --> 24:33.600
So... I think it's just a heavy
period you're having.

24:33.601 --> 24:36.280
Painful and not nice,
but nothing more sinister than that.

24:36.281 --> 24:37.800
There is nothing to worry about.

24:37.801 --> 24:41.802
You starting your period is just
another milestone on the road to
health.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.041
I like your paperweight.

25:02.042 --> 25:06.042
See you, Rae.

25:06.762 --> 25:10.762
OK. We've had the results
of the urine sample. And...

25:12.402 --> 25:13.641
No, sorry.

25:13.642 --> 25:17.642
Ah.

25:21.682 --> 25:24.882
Ah...

25:29.842 --> 25:32.921
You...

25:32.922 --> 25:34.801
You are pregnant. Um...

25:34.802 --> 25:36.401
around four weeks.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.641
Um, I'd like an abortion.

25:38.642 --> 25:41.840
Yeah, well, that's certainly
an option you could consider.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.840
But you don't have to
decide anything today.

25:44.841 --> 25:46.400
We provide a counselling service

25:46.401 --> 25:48.280
where someone can talk to you on
a one...

25:48.281 --> 25:50.080
No, I don't want any of that.

25:50.081 --> 25:52.122
I just want to get it over with.

25:52.123 --> 25:53.241
Yeah, well, OK.

25:53.242 --> 25:55.440
It's up to me to make sure
you have every opportunity

25:55.441 --> 25:58.280
to make the decision
that's right for you, so...

25:58.281 --> 26:00.640
Let me book you in to see
one our advisors tomorrow,

26:00.641 --> 26:03.522
and then, if you still want to go
ahead, you know, hey, that's fine.

26:03.523 --> 26:07.041
Well, what happens... if she does?

26:07.042 --> 26:09.942
Well, if you do decide
to go ahead with it,

26:10.004 --> 26:11.964
then tomorrow you'll be given what's
called

26:11.968 --> 26:13.446
an early medical abortion pill.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.086
Then you'll take another one on
Saturday.

26:16.087 --> 26:17.808
Following the second treatment,

26:17.809 --> 26:21.607
you'll most likely want to be at
home afterwards.

26:21.608 --> 26:25.328
'And there's another thing
Chloe's better at than me...

26:25.329 --> 26:27.647
'..holding it together.

26:27.648 --> 26:31.006

where I'd crumble.

'Like when I...'

26:43.328 --> 26:47.328
You all right?

26:51.528 --> 26:55.528
Yeah. I'm fine.

27:03.608 --> 27:05.727
Well, thanks for coming.

27:05.728 --> 27:08.207
It's all right.

27:08.208 --> 27:11.328
I can come along with you tomorrow,
if you want.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.207
Nah.

27:13.208 --> 27:16.367
I'm going to take your advice.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.968
I'm going to tell Stephen tonight.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.607
He'll look after me.

27:21.608 --> 27:24.807
Well, what about Saturday
for the second pill?

27:24.808 --> 27:26.008
Everyone's going to be at Knebworth.

27:26.009 --> 27:28.847
Rae, Stephen'll look after me.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.207
You know... I'll be fine.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.247
I'll just...

27:34.248 --> 27:36.607
see you in a bit, then.

27:36.608 --> 27:40.608
OK.

27:46.608 --> 27:49.407
Well...

27:49.408 --> 27:52.327
you were right.

27:52.328 --> 27:55.847
I never thought I'd hear you say
that.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.327
I do miss her.

27:58.328 --> 28:02.328
But... things have changed.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.807
She's got a boyfriend now...

28:05.808 --> 28:09.808
and you don't need your friends as
much when you've got a boyfriend, do
you?

28:11.088 --> 28:12.487
At the last session,

28:12.488 --> 28:14.527
we never finished discussing

28:14.528 --> 28:17.208
what made you feel so angry towards
Chloe.

28:17.209 --> 28:19.367
I told you why.

28:19.368 --> 28:23.368
I gave you my fully detailed
psychological analysis.

28:23.728 --> 28:26.487
Yeah, but I never gave you mine.

28:26.488 --> 28:30.488
Do you want to hear it?

28:32.248 --> 28:35.846
A couple of weeks ago,
I had to pretend to be your uncle,

28:35.847 --> 28:39.848
because you haven't told anybody
out there that you've been ill.

28:40.368 --> 28:43.127
Including Chloe.

28:43.128 --> 28:44.888
And I think you might be angry
with her

28:44.889 --> 28:48.007
because you're starting to realise

28:48.008 --> 28:50.488
that maybe she's no longer the type
of friend

28:50.489 --> 28:53.927
that you can talk to about things.

28:53.928 --> 28:57.887
Oh, I couldn't give a rat's arse
what Chloe's like.

28:57.888 --> 29:01.447
I don't care about Chloe.
I care about you.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.647
And it is important to me

29:03.648 --> 29:05.848
that you've got somebody out there
you can talk to

29:05.849 --> 29:07.767
when things get dark,

29:07.768 --> 29:09.688
when you think about hurting
yourself.

29:09.689 --> 29:13.688
I've got my diary.
I can talk to that if things get bad.

29:14.328 --> 29:18.127
Yeah, well, you can leave things out
of a diary.

29:18.128 --> 29:22.128
You can rip out whole pages
and pretend they don't exist.

29:25.088 --> 29:29.088
This is my new home number.

29:30.048 --> 29:32.647
Now, I want you to call it.

29:32.648 --> 29:36.648
At any time, day or night.

29:37.128 --> 29:41.128
Whenever you start to feel...
you know.

29:45.008 --> 29:46.687
I don't need it.

29:46.688 --> 29:49.407
Rae!

29:49.408 --> 29:53.408
You're taking this piece of
paper. End of.

30:03.408 --> 30:05.487
'Short skirt,

30:05.488 --> 30:09.447
'girly top.

30:09.448 --> 30:13.448
'This is all new to me, being a girl.

30:13.488 --> 30:15.727
'It's difficult being quiet,

30:15.728 --> 30:18.887
'not telling jokes or swearing,

30:18.888 --> 30:22.888
'especially when the mega period
was becoming a super mega period.

30:23.608 --> 30:26.967
'I felt like my eyeballs were
sweating.'

30:26.968 --> 30:29.246
Right,
so if we get two crates of beer

30:29.247 --> 30:31.606
and a bottle of voddy for each car,
we're rocking.

30:31.607 --> 30:33.208
Raemundo, are you all right with
beer?

30:33.602 --> 30:36.922
Chop, you might enjoy
having a ridiculous nickname,

30:36.994 --> 30:38.393
but I don't.

30:38.394 --> 30:40.433
It's Rae or Rachel.

30:40.434 --> 30:42.673
What? Do you want beer or not?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.833
Not. I'd like some Lambrini.

30:45.834 --> 30:49.834
That's what I drink now.

30:50.034 --> 30:52.193
Oh, Jesus...

30:52.194 --> 30:55.433
All right, lads. Move up!

30:55.434 --> 30:59.113
Right, who's got any tune requests
for the trip?

30:59.114 --> 31:01.352
Because I am doing
the tapes for the cars.

31:01.353 --> 31:02.832
Why are you doing them?

31:02.833 --> 31:04.432
I know the most about music.

31:04.433 --> 31:07.274
You know about as much about music
as my mum.

31:08.954 --> 31:12.273
All right. But under no
circumstances,

31:12.274 --> 31:14.793
feature Spaceman by Babylon Zoo.

31:14.794 --> 31:16.913
No Babylon Zoo.

31:16.914 --> 31:19.952
Thank you very much for sharing
your in-depth knowledge of music

31:19.953 --> 31:21.314
with us, Rae, that's brilliant.

31:21.315 --> 31:23.513
Such a prick.

31:23.514 --> 31:27.514
Right, I took the liberty
of treating everyone.

31:28.394 --> 31:30.073
Little Al.

31:30.074 --> 31:31.672
Oh, yeah. Nice one, Chop!

31:31.673 --> 31:33.594
There you are, Finn.
Nice one, mate!

31:33.595 --> 31:37.594
Raemundo.

31:38.794 --> 31:41.433
What's up with you? You all right?

31:41.434 --> 31:43.153
No, I've...

31:43.154 --> 31:44.594
I've got a tummy ache.

31:44.595 --> 31:45.833
Oh, damn.

31:45.834 --> 31:49.834
Better be OK for tomorrow.
Like the shirt?

31:50.834 --> 31:52.872
Why don't you try it on?
I dunno.

31:52.873 --> 31:53.512
Try it on!

31:53.513 --> 31:54.912
Maybe I don't want to try it on!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.192
What's wrong with you?

31:56.193 --> 31:59.432
I told everyone that you was dead
cool and that you were dead funny.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.872
You've sat here all night
with a right face on.

32:01.873 --> 32:04.632
Well, maybe I can't win!
Maybe I just can't fucking win!

32:04.633 --> 32:07.194
No matter how hard I try,
I just can't get it right.

32:07.195 --> 32:11.194
I don't even know why I bother!

32:18.394 --> 32:22.394
Oh, crazy. Crazy. What are you doing?

32:23.194 --> 32:26.833
Stop being stupid.

32:26.834 --> 32:30.194
Stupid.

32:37.314 --> 32:38.353
No...

32:38.354 --> 32:39.873
No...

32:39.874 --> 32:43.874
No, no, no...

33:26.194 --> 33:30.194
Oh... my... God!

33:31.714 --> 33:33.793
Jabba's got a jam stain!

33:33.794 --> 33:36.033
I think I'm gonna be sick!

33:36.034 --> 33:37.992
I genuinely think I'm gonna be sick.

33:37.993 --> 33:40.994
Jabba's got a jam stain!
That's got to be the dirtiest thing

33:40.995 --> 33:43.673
I've ever seen.
You absolute scrubber.

33:43.674 --> 33:45.554
Scrubber!
Scrubber, scrubber, scrubber!

33:45.555 --> 33:49.554
Scrubber...

33:52.354 --> 33:53.792
What are you doing, you?

33:53.793 --> 33:56.272
It's all right taking the piss
out of a girl, isn't it?

33:56.273 --> 33:58.672
Well, why don't you try taking the
piss out of me?

33:58.673 --> 34:00.432
Eh? You apologise to her now

34:00.433 --> 34:02.994
or I will fucking curl you up,
all right?

34:02.995 --> 34:05.873
All right. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

34:05.874 --> 34:08.293
And that goes for you two twats,
as well.

34:08.341 --> 34:12.341
Sorry.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.487
You all right?

34:34.608 --> 34:38.608
'Saturday, 10th August, 1996.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.514
'The Day of Knebworth!

34:41.516 --> 34:42.496
'Who'd have thought

34:42.545 --> 34:46.344
'the day I get to see
Liam Gallagher in the flesh,

34:46.346 --> 34:50.346
'all my thoughts would be
about another man?

34:50.545 --> 34:52.744
'How could I have got him so wrong?

34:52.745 --> 34:55.786
'How could I have thought
that he was shallow

34:55.786 --> 34:58.225
'when he's the most interesting,

34:58.226 --> 35:00.785
'sweet, sensitive,

35:00.786 --> 35:04.785

in all of Lincolnshire

35:04.786 --> 35:06.106
'and the surrounding districts?'

35:06.107 --> 35:10.106
Rae!

35:15.094 --> 35:17.773
I just bought, two days ago,

35:17.774 --> 35:20.533
on your request, 20 Tampax!

35:20.534 --> 35:22.013
20!

35:22.014 --> 35:24.634
And now there are
exactly none left.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.506
What have you got,
six vaginae or something?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.805
I decided to change them every hour.

35:29.809 --> 35:31.728
Every hour?!

35:31.729 --> 35:35.407
Your hoo-ha must be the driest place
in the entire universe.

35:35.408 --> 35:37.367
I didn't want to get toxic shock!

35:37.368 --> 35:40.087
Izzy told me about this girl
who left a tampon in too long.

35:40.088 --> 35:42.769
It went rotten, she got
multiple organ failure,

35:42.770 --> 35:45.648
then she went into
a coma and she died.

35:45.649 --> 35:49.649
Tox...?! You...!

35:51.489 --> 35:54.608
I just, er...

35:54.609 --> 35:56.168
I just...

35:56.169 --> 36:00.169
I just can't...

36:02.329 --> 36:05.368
This is my main meal for the day.

36:05.369 --> 36:07.008
What is it?

36:07.009 --> 36:09.368
Fucking Cup-a-Soup.

36:09.369 --> 36:12.488
Beef flavour.

36:12.489 --> 36:14.849
Maybe you should just
go back to solids.

36:14.850 --> 36:18.849
Oh... today's the last day.

36:19.649 --> 36:22.968
I just need to
make it till tomorrow.

36:22.969 --> 36:26.969
It's solids tomorrow. Then it's...

36:27.489 --> 36:31.489
I just... I need to
make it till tomorrow.

36:31.729 --> 36:33.408
I'll be all right.

36:33.409 --> 36:35.728
I'll be all right tomorrow.

36:35.729 --> 36:39.569
Just keep thinking about tomorrow.

36:58.409 --> 37:01.408
Knebworth, baby girl! Let's do this!

37:01.409 --> 37:03.809
You're in Barney's car
with Finn. Come on!

37:05.916 --> 37:06.996
Hi, Rae!

37:07.027 --> 37:08.267
Hey.

37:11.027 --> 37:12.906
Hiya.

37:12.907 --> 37:14.426
All right?

37:14.427 --> 37:16.706
How's your hand?

37:16.707 --> 37:18.146
I'll live.

37:18.147 --> 37:21.626
Thanks.

37:21.627 --> 37:24.187
Anyone would have done
the same thing, you know.

37:24.188 --> 37:27.506
No, they wouldn't.

37:27.507 --> 37:31.266
Right, everyone, this
convoy is heading out!

37:31.267 --> 37:32.867
Let's get ready! Let's do this.

37:32.868 --> 37:35.626
Raemundo, come on!

37:35.627 --> 37:37.426
Let's go!

37:37.427 --> 37:38.985
What are you doing here?

37:38.986 --> 37:41.067
I just thought I'd see everyone off.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.826
Did you tell him?

37:43.827 --> 37:45.146
We broke up.

37:45.147 --> 37:48.746
What?!

37:48.747 --> 37:51.066
Who's going with you today, then?

37:51.067 --> 37:53.266
Don't worry about it.

37:53.267 --> 37:57.267
Raemundo, come on, get your ass in
gear! We're ready to go. Come on!

37:58.707 --> 37:59.826
You'd better go.

37:59.827 --> 38:01.627
Chloe, are you sure
you're going to be all right?

38:01.628 --> 38:03.746
Yeah, I'll be fine.

38:03.747 --> 38:06.787
See you later.

38:08.867 --> 38:11.466
Let's go!

38:11.467 --> 38:12.587
Come on!

38:22.427 --> 38:23.866
What?

38:23.867 --> 38:26.545
I'm expecting marks out of
ten for each tune, by the way.

38:26.546 --> 38:28.867
Yeah, well, it's
a zero for starters.

38:28.868 --> 38:32.867
I thought this was
your favourite song.

38:47.227 --> 38:49.106
- Stop.
- What?

38:49.107 --> 38:52.506
Stop the car!

39:19.027 --> 39:21.667
You know, he'd just
split up with his ex.

39:21.668 --> 39:25.667
They were together like...
six years or something.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.347
So he's not really in the place

39:28.384 --> 39:32.384
to commit to something
new at the moment.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.824
Plus, he's a complete
knobhead wanker.

39:40.384 --> 39:43.424
Do you know, he had
a name for his thingy.

39:43.670 --> 39:44.789
What?

39:44.790 --> 39:46.150
Bob.

39:46.247 --> 39:46.806
Bob?

39:46.807 --> 39:50.807
Yeah.

39:57.447 --> 40:01.447
You know, I'm sorry about this week.

40:03.207 --> 40:06.166
Just sometimes I see you
with everyone,

40:06.167 --> 40:08.886
you know? The lads. And...

40:08.887 --> 40:12.246
you're so funny and clever. And...

40:12.247 --> 40:14.286
I just...

40:14.287 --> 40:18.287
I wish sometimes I'd get
the chance to be seen as funny.

40:18.487 --> 40:20.646
You are funny.

40:20.647 --> 40:24.647
Oh, Chloe, the boys all love you.

40:25.807 --> 40:29.606
I didn't get invited
to Knebworth, though, did I?

40:29.607 --> 40:33.607
Eh?

40:48.447 --> 40:50.486
I went to the market

40:50.487 --> 40:54.166
and I bought a jockstrap.

40:54.167 --> 40:56.686
I don't know why!

40:56.687 --> 40:58.366
Right, OK.

40:58.367 --> 41:00.526
I went to the market

41:00.527 --> 41:02.725
- and I bought a jockstrap...
- Oh!

41:02.726 --> 41:03.967
And a pineapple.

41:05.327 --> 41:10.127
- I went to the market...
- Miss Chloe Gemmell?

42:07.687 --> 42:10.486
You all right?

42:10.487 --> 42:12.807
Yeah, I think that's it now.

42:14.767 --> 42:16.526
Aw...!

42:16.527 --> 42:18.766
Listen to that crowd!

42:18.767 --> 42:22.767
I can almost smell
the burgers just frying

42:22.847 --> 42:26.847
in the stalls
at the side of the fields.

42:28.127 --> 42:28.766
Oh, no!

42:28.767 --> 42:30.326
Oh, no!
Oh, no, what?

42:30.327 --> 42:32.285
Some tall bastard's
just stood in front of me.

42:32.286 --> 42:34.005
I can't see the stage any more!

42:34.006 --> 42:36.125
Do you know what?
I fucking hate that!

42:36.126 --> 42:38.087
You can get on my
shoulders if you want!

42:38.088 --> 42:39.286
Yeah? Yeah.

42:39.287 --> 42:42.127
Oh. Maybe you should
get on my shoulders.

42:42.128 --> 42:43.967
Yeah.

42:47.287 --> 42:49.006
This is nice.

42:49.007 --> 42:50.327
Why don't we invite Izzy around?

42:50.328 --> 42:53.966
No.

42:53.967 --> 42:55.366
No, I...

42:55.367 --> 42:57.686
I like it when it's just us two.

42:57.687 --> 42:59.966
I love Izzy,

42:59.967 --> 43:03.967
but... but I think her head would've
exploded if I'd told her.

43:10.967 --> 43:14.967
Yeah. It needed to be you.

43:16.967 --> 43:18.326
Come here.

43:18.327 --> 43:21.406
Aw...

43:21.407 --> 43:25.407
You're all right, though, yeah?

43:35.567 --> 43:36.726
Chloe...

43:36.727 --> 43:39.446
Hmm?

43:39.447 --> 43:42.846
I wasn't in France this year.

43:42.847 --> 43:46.847
Where were you?

43:47.247 --> 43:49.606
I've been ill.

43:49.607 --> 43:53.607
What do you mean, ill?

43:53.887 --> 43:57.887
Like, proper ill?

43:59.087 --> 44:02.926
I did something stupid.

44:02.927 --> 44:06.927
I hurt myself.

44:09.007 --> 44:13.007
Why, Rae?

44:14.367 --> 44:18.367
Why would you do that?

44:24.927 --> 44:28.566
I've got it!

44:28.567 --> 44:31.886
Hello.

44:31.887 --> 44:35.206
Hiya.

44:35.207 --> 44:38.006
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:38.007 --> 44:42.007
Just listening to Knebworth. Why?

44:43.047 --> 44:46.246
Yeah, all right!

44:46.247 --> 44:50.247
All right, fine. Bye.

44:52.527 --> 44:56.086
That was Stephen.

44:56.087 --> 44:59.046
He wants to talk, so, um...

44:59.047 --> 45:02.806
I'm going to go round to his house.

45:02.807 --> 45:04.206
When?

45:04.207 --> 45:06.006
You know, I need to go.

45:06.007 --> 45:09.367
We'll talk about this
when I get back, I promise.

45:09.368 --> 45:10.966
Chloe, I...

45:10.967 --> 45:13.727
Rae, I really need to know
what he's got to say.

45:15.727 --> 45:18.807
Can you stay here so my
parents still think I'm in?

45:18.808 --> 45:20.046
What?

45:20.047 --> 45:23.207
Look, Rae, please! I'll be...
I'll be as quick as I can.

45:23.208 --> 45:26.006
OK? So just... just stay here.

45:26.007 --> 45:28.366
I'll be half an hour... tops.

45:28.367 --> 45:32.367
OK? Just don't move.
