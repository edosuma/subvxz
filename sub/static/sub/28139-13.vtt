00:04.439 --> 00:07.224
- Previously on "Good Girls":
- I'm giving you the keys

00:07.268 --> 00:08.747
to the kingdom here.
Kingdom's in your name.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.359
- He took it back.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.187
I'm about to be arrested
for murder!

00:13.230 --> 00:15.319
- Hey, I don't work while
I'm on vacation.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.018
- That's what I am? Work?
Your money's cooked.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.671
The Feds know everything.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.761
- I'm going to make it as easy
as possible for the kids.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.024
I need to protect my family.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.329
- Do you still love
each other?

00:25.373 --> 00:26.809
- I found this thing online.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.637
We would rent a place
and the kids would stay here,

00:28.680 --> 00:30.900
and you and I would switch
off every couple of days.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.206
- Okay.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.598
- How's it going with
the sister?

00:33.642 --> 00:36.775
- Not in the Friend Zone.
- Already?

00:36.819 --> 00:38.125
- You're FBI!

00:38.168 --> 00:40.214
- I love you.
- So what happens next?

00:40.257 --> 00:41.563
- I'm sure you have
much bigger fish to fry

00:41.606 --> 00:43.391
than a mother of four.
- Come on.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.957
You are way more than that.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.524
- What's your angle here, man?

00:46.568 --> 00:48.178
- Go on record saying you saw
Leslie Peterson's murder.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.658
How Beth Boland chopped him up.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.181
- Is he going
to take Daddy again?

00:51.225 --> 00:52.748
- I'm still hoping
we can work it out.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.533
- They're counterfeiters!
- If we dig deeper--

00:55.577 --> 00:57.187
- You get motive
for the murder too.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.536
- You are ratting out a gang!

00:58.580 --> 00:59.972
You think they're going
to let you talk?

01:00.016 --> 01:01.017
You gotta disappear for good.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.192
I meant what I said.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.933
If it's not us, it'll be them.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.109
You'll get the other half when
we know you left the country.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.329
- He was stealing from me,
wasn't he?

01:08.372 --> 01:10.200
-  I'm gonna kill him!

01:10.244 --> 01:12.463
It was an accident.

01:12.507 --> 01:13.943
- She murdered him, Beth.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.814
What are we supposed to do
with this?

01:15.858 --> 01:17.642
- What color
was Boomer's hair?

01:17.686 --> 01:19.253
- We call the cops.
- You want to explain

01:19.296 --> 01:20.906
that we dumped the wrong body?

01:20.950 --> 01:23.518
- You rather get put away for
murdering a guy who's not dead?

01:23.561 --> 01:25.998
- Thought you might want
your key back.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.478
Annie Banannie.

01:31.265 --> 01:36.096

with Saigon cinnamon

02:38.245 --> 02:40.638
and burnt orange
morning roll.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.553
- No buckle?

02:44.207 --> 02:45.513
- Not today.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.169
Don't be shy!

03:00.789 --> 03:02.791
- Whenever you're ready,
Mrs. Boland.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.542
- My name is
Elizabeth Irene Boland.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.374

Leslie Peterson.

he's phoning it in.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.742
Nana got sold a yogurt
from September.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.528
No way he's rotating
the milk.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.705
- We are being charged with
your murder, you piece of--

03:47.749 --> 03:50.404
- Would anyone like
a soft drink?

03:53.189 --> 03:54.756
Girls?

03:54.799 --> 03:57.454
- No, thank you.
- All good.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.064
- I'll have a Tab.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.762
- Oh.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.374
- What are you doing?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.376
- Calling the cops and telling
them that you're alive.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.291
- You can't do that.
- Watch.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.814
- They'll kill me.
- The cops?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.903
- The gang!

04:12.948 --> 04:14.297
- Screw this fool!

04:14.341 --> 04:15.907
You're gonna go in there,

04:15.951 --> 04:17.561
you're gonna show them
your new Flavor Savor,

04:17.605 --> 04:19.520
and you're gonna tell them
you've never been better.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.000
- Oh. Oh yeah, okay.

04:22.044 --> 04:25.961
- Yeah, 'cause we're not about
to go down for your sorry ass.

04:26.004 --> 04:29.878
- Then I'll tell them about
the other sorry ass.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.578
What other sorry ass?

04:36.319 --> 04:38.452
- The one in the trash bag.

04:48.853 --> 04:52.292
I'm gonna need a straw,
Nana.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.909
I saw how you threw him
in the back of a minivan

05:00.952 --> 05:02.345
like a wet dog.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.129
- How?

05:04.173 --> 05:06.349
- I hid out behind Mary Pat's.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.657
Lived off the land.

05:12.007 --> 05:15.402
You can drink your own urine
till it's brown.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.188
- You were like 100 yards
from a 7-Eleven.

05:19.231 --> 05:21.712
- They have cameras.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.672
- I'm sorry.
So that's your plan?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.456
You're gonna hole up
like Anne Frank up there

05:26.500 --> 05:27.979
for the rest of your life?

05:29.981 --> 05:32.027
- No.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.811
There's a surgeon in Tampa.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.987
Does full facial
reconstruction.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.815
He's the only guy Escobar
would ever use.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.556
It's like witness protection,
but only better.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.994
You know, I get a new face,
I get to start over.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.475
- That's...

05:45.519 --> 05:47.651
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.871
- I want my life back, okay?

05:49.914 --> 05:52.830
You know, whatever.
What do you care?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.141
Thank you.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.840
- How much?

06:02.884 --> 06:04.059
- All of it.

06:04.102 --> 06:07.192
Nose, cheekbones, jaw.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.717
Nana, get my vision board.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.502
- Which one?
The girls or the cards?

06:12.546 --> 06:14.765
- The face one.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.815
- How much does it cost?

06:20.858 --> 06:22.077
- No!

06:22.120 --> 06:24.296
- You couldn't afford it.
- Neither can you.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.342
- We are not going down
this road again.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.693
We're gonna buy him a new face
and he's going to ghost us.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.434
Again.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.218
- First you show cops old face.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.742
- First you show me money.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.657
- Well,
who are you even going for?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.268
- Rupert Grint.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.096
- The ginger from Harry Potter?

06:41.139 --> 06:43.794
- Yes, the doctor said he's
closest to my bone structure.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.448
You know what?
It's not that far off.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.408
Where is she with
the vision board? Nana!

06:49.800 --> 06:50.540
- Jesus.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.449
- Hi.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.972
- Hey.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.716
- How are you?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.892
- What's going on?

07:41.156 --> 07:43.593
- Your neighbors said
you moved out.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.814
- Yeah, something like that.

07:46.857 --> 07:50.513
- Where'd you go this time?
Epcot? Six Flags?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.384
- What do you want,
Elizabeth?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.261
- I need some money again.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.915
- I gave you
the keys to the kingdom.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.438
- I know.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.614
- But you didn't want them.

08:06.007 --> 08:10.707
- If I could ask anyone
but you, I would.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.496
I'm in real trouble,
all right?

08:18.367 --> 08:22.110
- That Fed's got
a real hard-on for you, huh?

08:22.763 --> 08:25.156
- Not the good kind.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.595
- Thing is, I'm a little dry
right now. You know how it is.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.079
What are you doing?

08:35.123 --> 08:36.733
- What do you mean?

08:36.777 --> 08:38.735
- I mean, right now.
What are you doing?

08:43.566 --> 08:45.481
- Nothing.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.135
Just getting my hair cut.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.790
- Don't.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.879
- What?
- Don't cut it.

08:55.230 --> 08:58.407
It's just a little trim.

08:58.450 --> 09:01.541
- I like pushing it
out of your face.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.023
Yeah, just like that.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.603
Ha, you got me.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.692
So listen,
I wish I could help.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.694
- You could.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.348
You choose not to.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.394
- Ah, don't be like that,
Elizabeth.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.096
- Like a toddler
playing with his food,

09:35.139 --> 09:39.230
the orca tosses the seal pup
high into the air

09:39.274 --> 09:43.408
before devouring him,
and what began as...

09:43.452 --> 09:45.236
- Turner's got a warrant.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.633
- How long?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.940
- 48 hours.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.335
- Let's get out of here.
Let's just go right now.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.424
- I have a son.
- So just bring him!

09:59.468 --> 10:01.775
- He has a dad.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.265
When it goes down, I got...

10:15.919 --> 10:18.400
I got to do my job.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.934
Do you want to make cookies?

10:32.109 --> 10:33.850
- What?

10:35.156 --> 10:36.810
- Never done it.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.117
- Yeah, why not?

10:47.908 --> 10:49.300
- It's a suicide mission.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.346
- It worked.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.609
So this guy would go
to a bar, order a beer,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.699
order lunch like a burger,
awesome blossom, whatever

10:56.743 --> 10:58.135
and then he would
take a coaster,

10:58.179 --> 10:59.876
put it on the top
of his glass

10:59.920 --> 11:01.443
like he was going to
the bathroom or something.

11:01.486 --> 11:05.012
Excuse me! I'm sorry.
Could we get some ketchup?

11:05.055 --> 11:09.190
Then he would rob the place,
come back with a bag of cash,

11:09.233 --> 11:11.583
enjoy the game and, like,
finish his lunch.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.846
- Stupid is what it is.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.805
- It's kind of
a perfect alibi.

11:15.849 --> 11:16.980
- Not if he was on "20/20"

11:17.024 --> 11:18.416
talking about
how he got caught.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.157
- What do you want to do?

11:20.201 --> 11:22.551
- Call the cops on
that weasely little bitch.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.205
- Okay.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.467
- Okay.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.730
- Okay and then he, um,
tells 'em about Jeff

11:27.774 --> 11:29.689
and they dig him
out of my front yard.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.474
- We do this,
we're straight up hoodlums.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.824
- I hear you, but Jeff...

11:34.868 --> 11:37.174
- It's insane!

11:38.523 --> 11:40.221
- Thank you.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.396
Jeff.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.703
- We didn't kill him.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.749
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.577
Can we also get
a side of ranch?

11:48.620 --> 11:50.231
- Ooh, yes. Ranch.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.928
Thanks.

11:51.972 --> 11:55.018
- But Turner will make it
look like we did.

12:01.198 --> 12:04.767
- Couple of cameras,
one security guard.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.334
Everybody is old.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.988
I'm not talking
Liam Neeson old,

12:08.031 --> 12:10.033
I'm talking, like,
Benjamin Button old.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.948
I mean, like, little.

12:11.992 --> 12:14.559
Like I mean I could take them,
you know?

12:14.603 --> 12:18.346
Honestly, I'm not sure
why we waited so long.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.130
Who's winning?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.533
- This one's for friendship,
that one's for cooking.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.665
- What's happening?
- That one's for navigation.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.842
- I FaceTime'd your mother.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.844
- This one's for service.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.236
- Why would you do that?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.543
- I want them to
know her more.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.634
- You feeling okay, babe?

12:46.722 --> 12:48.768
- You're facing
three to five.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.945
- Okay,
but they still got you.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.560
- Tomorrow,
I'm robbing a bank.

13:13.967 --> 13:17.709
- All children! Please
report to the dance floor!

13:17.753 --> 13:21.496
All children
to the dance floor, please!

13:21.539 --> 13:24.760
- What's going on?
- Making moments, kid.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.370
- Can't we do it
in the morning?

13:26.414 --> 13:29.199
- If you plan it,
it's not a moment! Duh!

13:29.243 --> 13:33.203
Now I'm gonna need you to get
up and shake some booty!

13:33.247 --> 13:34.857
Let's go!

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
- I got to pay that
little dick off.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.729
- Ruby.
- Or get life for killing him.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.079
- Ruby--
- Or life for dumping a body,

13:39.122 --> 13:40.428
dragging it all over town

13:40.471 --> 13:41.908
and using it to mulch
my girl's flower bed.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.518
- Yeah, but if you kick
in the bank part

13:43.561 --> 13:44.519
then you're gonna
get life plus 20.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.956
- They got warrants, Stan.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.746
- So it's got two closets so we
can both keep some stuff there.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.053
It's kind of all we can afford,

13:57.097 --> 14:00.927
but I--I think it's going help
it feel normal for the kids.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.451
- It reminds me of our old
place in Hamtramck.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.629
With the linoleum?

14:07.672 --> 14:09.109
- Do you remember that
the hallway

14:09.152 --> 14:10.762
always smelled like pierogis?

14:10.806 --> 14:12.634
- Oh God,
what was that about?

14:12.677 --> 14:15.767
It was terrible.
Like pierogis 24/7.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.552
- I think it was a candle
or something.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.771
- Candle? Who does that?

14:19.815 --> 14:22.209
Nobody has ever wanted
that smell ever. Ugh!

14:22.252 --> 14:25.734
- I know, but every night.
Every night, pierogis.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.302
- Terrible. I like pierogis.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.521
- I love pierogis.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.482
- Oh, my God.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.918

gave you detention,

27:26.557 --> 27:28.821
- So have you heard anything?

27:28.864 --> 27:32.563
- Word is, Turner's got
so much egg on his face,

27:32.607 --> 27:36.306
the D.A.'s talking about
tossing the whole thing.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.484
- I mean...

27:40.528 --> 27:43.966
you think it's, like,
overover?

27:44.010 --> 27:47.361
- Well, if it is,

27:47.404 --> 27:51.452
we are the stupidest, luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.380
Never again though, right?

28:06.423 --> 28:08.774
You're through with it.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.341
Choose us from now on.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.824
- Okay.

28:15.868 --> 28:19.567
- Introducing the new Waterpik
whitening water flosser,

28:19.610 --> 28:22.091
the first device that delivers
precision whitening

28:22.135 --> 28:23.789
while you floss.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.269
It restores your natural
whiteness in just four weeks.

28:26.313 --> 28:27.793
- What I've noticed
the most

28:27.836 --> 28:29.838
after using
the whitening water flosser

28:29.882 --> 28:31.710
is how bright my smile is.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.755
Um, I feel so much
more confident

28:33.799 --> 28:36.410
in talking to people
with my smile

28:36.453 --> 28:38.978
and also my breath is just
so much fresher

28:39.021 --> 28:40.893
for hours after using it.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.895
- The secret is Waterpik's
patented whitening

28:42.938 --> 28:44.592
and fuser technology

28:44.635 --> 28:47.464
that expertly mixes water with
a gentle whitening agent

28:47.508 --> 28:49.728
to remove stubborn
and hard-to-reach stains.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.034
The whitening water flosser
is clinically proven

28:52.078 --> 28:54.907
to remove 25% more stains
than brushing alone.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.910
It's up to 50% more effective
than string floss

28:57.953 --> 28:59.650
for improving gum health--

29:25.851 --> 29:27.853
- Did you really go
to Michigan State?

29:29.332 --> 29:31.595
- Hmm.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.162
Naval Academy.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.514
- So you're, like,
super smart.

29:44.130 --> 29:47.611
But you grew up
in Minneapolis, yes?

29:49.309 --> 29:50.963
- Philly.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.793
- Hmm.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.278
Do you really like kids?

30:08.371 --> 30:11.287
Yeah, I have one.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.598
His name's Justin.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.775
He's six.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.864
Lives in Arizona.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.936
- You know, they might
transfer me to Phoenix.

30:52.502 --> 30:56.811
Since, um,
since all this went south.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.382
- You mean the job?

31:03.731 --> 31:05.776
- Yes.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.957
Well, that'd be good.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.611
You could see your son.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.833
- It's a direct flight.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.055
Yeah.

31:23.098 --> 31:27.276
Well...
I burn super easy.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.977
- I'll buy you sunscreen.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.854
- Let's, um...

31:41.334 --> 31:43.597
Let's just go to bed.

31:59.178 --> 32:01.484
- I got you a gift.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.965
- What is wrong with you?

32:05.227 --> 32:08.796
- You know you're always saying
I don't help?

32:11.146 --> 32:12.974
That's me helping.

32:22.114 --> 32:26.422
- This right here?
That's your problem.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.949
Take care of it.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.083
- I already did.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.868
- Nah, he's not just gonna
let you walk away now.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.916
- I fixed it.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.353
- He knows your entire
bag of tricks, darling...

32:44.397 --> 32:46.965
what you do,

32:47.008 --> 32:49.532
who you are.

32:51.882 --> 32:55.408
He even knows what makes
your garden grow.

32:57.627 --> 33:01.501
Oh. my bad.

33:01.544 --> 33:04.460
Yeah, I might've let
that last one slip.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.030
Now, a guy like that
can't let that slide.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.860
- How does that saying go?

33:12.903 --> 33:17.778
Cockle shells, silver bells,
bodies all in a row?

33:17.821 --> 33:19.475
Ain't that right, boss?

33:26.091 --> 33:28.049

Nothing.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.312

37:07.355 --> 37:09.009
- Uh, I lived in corporate
housing

37:09.052 --> 37:11.881
two blocks
from a muffler factory.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.709
- I guess you were busy too.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.842
- Hmm.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.583

37:17.626 --> 37:20.716

your time now, Mrs. Boland?

37:24.416 --> 37:27.419

I just wanna be a mom.

37:27.462 --> 37:30.422

37:32.424 --> 37:34.513
- Are you gonna arrest me?

37:37.603 --> 37:40.388
I want to take a long vacation
with my fella.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.740
Maybe hit up
one of those lakes.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.136
- And then what?

37:49.179 --> 37:50.616
- Thanks for the coffee.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.276
- Oh, my God
and then what?

37:59.712 --> 38:01.279
- Let's see how you do.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.590
- Go and be a mom.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.463
- Hey guys,
I made you something.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.335
- What do you mean
you made it?

38:57.378 --> 38:59.598
- It's literally, like,
nail polish remover,

38:59.641 --> 39:01.469
hydrogen peroxide,
and bleach.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.689
It's, like, so easy.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.647
- It's kinda janky.
- Well, yeah,

39:05.691 --> 39:07.519
because I used Dean's ink jet

39:07.562 --> 39:09.477
just to see if it would work,
but we'd obviously get

39:09.521 --> 39:12.524
a better printer and maybe
even a graphic designer.

39:12.567 --> 39:15.004
There's this mom who has
a booth at the farmer's market.

39:15.048 --> 39:16.397
She does business cards,

39:16.441 --> 39:20.227
but she's super talented,
and she's divorced.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.928
What?

39:25.972 --> 39:27.190
- Don't "what" us.

39:27.234 --> 39:30.193
She knows what's what.

39:30.237 --> 39:33.414
- We can totally do
this without him.

39:42.989 --> 39:45.034
- You got this.
Come on.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.692
- I don't want it.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.956
- Yeah, well,
I didn't get a gift receipt.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.003
- Then why don't you do it?

39:57.046 --> 39:59.962
- 'Cause it's on you.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.442
- No, it's not!

40:01.486 --> 40:03.662
- Yeah.
Yeah it is, mama.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.229
- You put it on me.
- You asked for it.

40:06.273 --> 40:09.015
- You put everything on me!

40:09.058 --> 40:11.713
The money, the dealership.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.280
- Not easy being king, right?

40:13.323 --> 40:15.369
- You put it all on me
so it's never on you.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.675
Nothing's ever on you!
- Yeah, well,

40:16.718 --> 40:19.155
now you got
a bigger problem, don't you?

40:21.593 --> 40:24.726
- You think he's my problem?

40:24.770 --> 40:27.337
- So put on your big girl
panties and take care of it.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.904
- He's not my problem.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.080
- Shut your mouth,
bitch, okay, and just--

40:31.124 --> 40:32.299
- Ah!

40:38.479 --> 40:39.785
- Uhh--

40:39.828 --> 40:41.439
O--

40:54.539 --> 40:56.366
- Give me the gun.

40:56.410 --> 40:57.759
Go.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.240
Go!

41:27.354 --> 41:28.877
- You don't look so good,
buddy.

41:40.889 --> 41:45.111
- What do they say?
One's the loneliness number?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.157
- It ain't gotta be.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.116
Ah!

41:50.159 --> 41:54.468
- You know this means
you're gonna owe me, right?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.991
What do you say?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.951
I call them now,
you still got odds.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.911
- We got a deal?

42:11.354 --> 42:13.531
