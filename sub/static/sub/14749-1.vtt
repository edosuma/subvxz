WEBVTT

01:54.328 --> 01:56.204
Arthur.

02:09.675 --> 02:13.013
Metacomet, sir,
without your father's friendship,

02:13.430 --> 02:16.600
none of us could have survived
even our first winter.

02:21.563 --> 02:23.732
My father should have let you...

02:24.650 --> 02:25.525
die.

02:35.369 --> 02:36.286
You are...

02:36.912 --> 02:38.330
the only one...

02:39.373 --> 02:40.999
who comes to us...

02:41.667 --> 02:43.085
with an open heart.

02:45.462 --> 02:46.546
But your people...

02:46.838 --> 02:49.675
have murdered... my father...

02:50.258 --> 02:52.427
with their lies.

03:30.674 --> 03:32.217
<i>My name is Pearl.</i>

03:32.718 --> 03:35.929
<i>This is the story
of my mother, Hester Prynne.</i>

03:36.555 --> 03:40.058
<i>It was the year of our Lord 1666...</i>

03:40.350 --> 03:43.395
<i>when she arrived in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony...</i>

03:43.687 --> 03:47.691
<i>filled with hope that here, at last, in
this New World,</i>

03:47.983 --> 03:51.737
<i>would come the freedom to worship
without fear or persecution.</i>

03:58.326 --> 04:01.288
Ah, Stonehall.

04:03.457 --> 04:06.251
My esteemed colleague.

04:06.543 --> 04:08.253
Thy years of toil become thee.

04:08.545 --> 04:11.673
- Thy fame precedes thee, sir.
- Ohh.

04:11.965 --> 04:13.675
Governor Bellingham,

04:13.967 --> 04:17.428
may I present
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

04:17.721 --> 04:20.891
Welcome, sir. 'Tis a long voyage.

04:21.183 --> 04:22.934
<i>Three months at sea...</i>

04:23.226 --> 04:26.104
<i>will either take away thy faith
or harden it to iron.</i>

04:26.396 --> 04:30.442
Governor Bellingham, allow me to introduce
a young woman who's been traveling with us.

04:30.734 --> 04:32.611
Mistress Hester Prynne.

04:32.903 --> 04:36.615
Oh. I apologize for the coarseness
of my hands, mistress.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.201
But here in the colonies,
everyone must work.

04:39.493 --> 04:41.787
I look forward
to the hard work, Governor.

04:42.078 --> 04:45.665
As we read in Psalms 92, "I will triumph
in the works of Thy hands."

04:45.957 --> 04:48.335
Ah, thou canst quote
the Scriptures.

04:48.627 --> 04:50.629
Aye, Reverend, both testaments.

04:50.921 --> 04:52.631
My husband taught me.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.966
You must rest,
Reverend Cheever, and after,

04:55.258 --> 04:57.511
I look forward to showing you what has been
accomplished.
- Thank you.

04:57.803 --> 04:59.554
- Then 'tis "Goodwife Prynne."
- Yes, yes.

05:01.556 --> 05:05.060
- But I prefer to be called "Hester".
- Welcome, Hester.

05:05.352 --> 05:10.148
I wish I could have seen it when the first
ones came, when it was wild and untouched.

05:19.866 --> 05:22.369
Madam, you would do well here...

05:22.661 --> 05:25.497
to use less lace
in your dressmaking.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.460
Indeed, Reverend.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.014
Master of us all,

05:43.306 --> 05:46.685
we give thanks for
another bountiful meal...

05:46.977 --> 05:50.021
and for the newly arrived
disciples who-

05:50.313 --> 05:53.024
who share it with us this night.

05:54.818 --> 05:57.195
- Amen.
- Amen.

05:58.613 --> 06:01.366
So, Governor, I, for one,
am impatient to know...

06:01.658 --> 06:04.953
how your mission
to Metacomet fared.

06:05.245 --> 06:08.540
Well, Metacomet is not Massasoit,
Major Dunsmuir.

06:08.832 --> 06:11.543
I believe that if we respect
the agreements we made with his father,

06:11.835 --> 06:13.628
we have nothing to fear.

06:14.921 --> 06:16.756
Lest we should grow complacent,

06:17.048 --> 06:19.426
our wise God sends us a sign.

06:19.718 --> 06:24.431
Governor, when we sailed, your letters
assured us we were at peace with the savage.

06:24.723 --> 06:28.894
Well, I feel the days
of the so-called peace...

06:29.185 --> 06:30.896
with the Wampanoags
are at an end.

06:31.187 --> 06:33.189
Major, please, we're...

06:33.481 --> 06:35.650
We are frightening
our new arrival.

06:39.112 --> 06:42.032
We, uh-we hear
much talk at home...

06:42.324 --> 06:45.035
about your success
with the Praying Indians.

06:45.327 --> 06:49.414
I must say, I'm very eager to meet your
Reverend Dimmesdale and his converts.

06:49.706 --> 06:51.458
The runts of the litter.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.085
Dimmesdale's little treasures.

06:54.377 --> 06:56.379
Some of us have other opinions.

06:58.340 --> 07:02.093
Mistress Prynne, I hope you will be
staying with us here...

07:02.385 --> 07:04.095
until your husband's arrival.

07:04.387 --> 07:06.097
You're most kind,
Mistress Stonehall,

07:06.389 --> 07:09.392
but I intend to find a house
of my own as soon as possible.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.863
- On thine own?
- Why, yes.

07:22.155 --> 07:25.283
'Tis not considered fitting for
a young woman to live alone here.

07:25.575 --> 07:29.663
But my husband has sent me on ahead
to prepare a place for his arrival,

07:29.955 --> 07:31.998
so that is what I intend to do.

07:32.290 --> 07:36.127
Mistress Prynne, the rules we live by
might seem arbitrary...

07:36.419 --> 07:38.129
to a newcomer,

07:38.421 --> 07:41.883
but we have learnt the hard way that
without absolute order in all matters,

07:42.175 --> 07:44.511
we cannot hope to survive here.

07:44.803 --> 07:46.554
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

07:46.846 --> 07:50.183
Order. Survival.

07:50.475 --> 07:52.686
Would you have me
disobey my husband?

07:54.229 --> 07:56.356
- I wou-
- Reverend Cheever,

07:56.648 --> 08:00.485
you might enjoy the company
of my son, Brewster.

08:00.777 --> 08:02.529
He studied divinity at college.

08:02.821 --> 08:04.948
Harvard wasn't good enough for him,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.242
so he came back home
to make his fortune-

08:07.534 --> 08:12.706
A flock of ministers' sons all moaning
the Lord's P-Prayer in their sleep.

08:12.998 --> 08:15.875
Everybody must find his own niche.

08:18.044 --> 08:21.631
- Morning, Mistress Prynne.
- Good morrow.

08:31.850 --> 08:35.520
So you've come among us intent
on scandalizing the town, do you?

08:35.812 --> 08:37.480
Giddap.

08:37.772 --> 08:40.567
Good.

08:40.859 --> 08:43.278
I confess, I'm tired of being alone...

08:43.570 --> 08:46.197
in a sea of yea-sayers.

08:46.489 --> 08:49.034
Ha! Where shall we
begin our search?

08:49.325 --> 08:51.536
On the cliffs by the sea.

08:51.828 --> 08:53.872
No. It's out of the question.

08:54.164 --> 08:57.876
- Why?
- No one's lived by the sea...

08:58.168 --> 09:00.795
since the Indians wiped out
Ballinger's Point.

09:01.087 --> 09:03.131
I say we start there first.

09:03.423 --> 09:06.593
Well, if you've a mind to,
Mistress Prynne.

09:26.988 --> 09:30.116
Oh, Brewster, is that it?

09:32.827 --> 09:34.746
Oh, it's beautiful!

10:01.981 --> 10:04.442
<i>I struggle to imagine
what her life was...</i>

10:04.734 --> 10:07.153
<i>before she came to the New World.</i>

10:07.445 --> 10:11.574
<i>Why did her husband
send her on ahead... alone?</i>

10:11.866 --> 10:16.121
<i>Was it a test of her loyalty
or her spirit?</i>

10:16.412 --> 10:19.833
<i>Or was it an aspect of his nature
to set traps for people...</i>

10:20.125 --> 10:22.335
<i>in the hope that they
would fall into them?</i>

10:30.760 --> 10:32.554
It's perfect!

10:32.846 --> 10:35.265
With a cart and a good musket,
I could have a home here.

10:36.391 --> 10:39.894
Cart, horse, pitchfork, plow.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.897
I could think of so many better
things to do with these pretty hands...

10:43.189 --> 10:45.567
than grow calluses on them.

10:45.859 --> 10:47.986
I'll need indentured labor;
At least two men.

10:48.278 --> 10:52.782
- The land will need draining-
- You are headstrong, Mistress Prynne.

10:53.074 --> 10:55.535
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.329
I'm told your father
was of the same temperament.

10:58.621 --> 11:00.582
Is it true...

11:00.874 --> 11:05.170
he was in debt t-to your husband
and you were made the p-payment?

11:07.046 --> 11:09.465
Ah, I've said something
to disturb you.

11:09.757 --> 11:12.719
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.681
God, thou art wondrous fair.

11:22.979 --> 11:24.689
That hurt!

11:24.981 --> 11:27.775
Good. It will remind you
not to do that again.

11:29.569 --> 11:31.571
Faith! Prudence!

11:45.877 --> 11:49.380
Did you hear?
That Mistress Prynne has a bathing tub.

11:49.672 --> 11:52.133
What is she, French?

12:07.607 --> 12:10.068
<i>Two. Will you bid two shillings?</i>

12:10.360 --> 12:12.070
<i>Will you bid two? Two-and-a-half.</i>

12:12.362 --> 12:14.239
<i>Come on, gentlemen.
Will you bid two-and-a-half shillings?</i>

12:14.530 --> 12:17.242
<i>Going up to three shillings.
Do I have a bid for three shillings?</i>

12:17.533 --> 12:19.244
<i>Three shillings,
three shillings!</i>

12:19.535 --> 12:21.246
<i>Any more now?Anyone else?</i>

12:21.537 --> 12:24.332
<i>Going for three shillings.
Any other bids?</i>

12:24.624 --> 12:27.752
<i>All done now! Sold to the gentleman
for three shillings.</i>

12:28.044 --> 12:30.463
<i>Next we have this other one-
Whose two.</i>

12:30.755 --> 12:33.258
- How much time left on their indenture?
- 'Bout three years.

12:33.549 --> 12:36.427
But, huh, shouldn't your husband
or your father...

12:36.719 --> 12:38.721
be doing business
with me here, mistress?

12:39.013 --> 12:41.224
Is my money no good to you, sir?

12:41.516 --> 12:45.103
Oh, your money's fine
as wine in the sunshine, mistress.

12:45.395 --> 12:49.774
If you buy them at a just price, I'll throw
in this little girl with the red kerchief.

12:50.066 --> 12:51.651
She's a slave.

12:51.943 --> 12:55.947
Ah, but she don't speak,
if that be a problem. Born that way.

12:56.239 --> 12:58.658
Name your just price.

13:36.029 --> 13:39.866
We best accompany ye if you're
going into the forest, missus.

13:40.158 --> 13:43.453
Don't worry, Mr. Bobbin.
I shan't go far.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.287
<i>Mistress Prynne! Mistress Prynne!</i>

15:49.579 --> 15:53.166
<i>- Where are you?
- Mistress Prynne, where are you?</i>

15:56.002 --> 15:57.795
I found her! I found her!

15:58.087 --> 15:59.797
- You did not!
- I did too!

16:00.089 --> 16:02.008
- You did not.
- Did too.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.010
Mistress Prynne,

16:04.302 --> 16:06.929
has thou forgotten
it is the Sabbath?

16:09.515 --> 16:11.392
Of course not. Forgive me.

16:11.684 --> 16:14.479
We have come by especially
to bring you to church.

16:16.189 --> 16:18.691
Thank you so much.

16:18.983 --> 16:22.445
Please, go on without me
and I will follow at once.

16:22.737 --> 16:25.198
- Make haste.
- Yes, sir.

16:48.721 --> 16:51.015
All right, girl.

16:51.307 --> 16:53.726
Come on.

17:05.570 --> 17:07.406
Goodness.

17:08.907 --> 17:12.453
Back up. Back up. All right, then.
Come on. Back up.

17:18.251 --> 17:20.586
Come on. Come on, now. Back up.

17:20.877 --> 17:22.505
Good morrow.

17:29.262 --> 17:31.138
May I be of assistance?

17:32.431 --> 17:34.225
Not from up there.

17:34.517 --> 17:37.019
Come on.

17:40.856 --> 17:43.859
Come on. Steady. Steady.

17:52.868 --> 17:55.079
Can't seem to make
this horse understand me.

17:55.371 --> 17:58.207
Here. Let me try.

18:00.668 --> 18:02.461
Come on, girl. Come on.

18:02.753 --> 18:04.880
Come on. Back up!

18:05.172 --> 18:07.800
Come on! Come on.

18:08.092 --> 18:11.178
Come on, girl. Come on.

18:15.433 --> 18:17.435
I'm afraid you're in too deep.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.187
She'll not make it.
Now let me try this.

18:23.149 --> 18:25.443
I do hope you can get it free.

18:25.735 --> 18:28.487
I'm already late for the service, and
as it is, everyone's talking about me.

18:28.779 --> 18:32.617
I've been away and
I'm quite behind on the local gossip.

18:32.908 --> 18:35.453
I bought the old Newberry place
out on Ballinger's Point.

18:35.745 --> 18:40.082
Then I... I owe you an apology.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.210
I've been trespassing.

18:43.586 --> 18:45.796
There's a place at the Point
where I like to bathe.

18:46.088 --> 18:48.883
Really? Well, I shan't charge
too steep a tariff.

18:51.010 --> 18:53.054
Come on, girl. Back up.

18:53.346 --> 18:55.056
Oh, back up.

18:55.348 --> 18:57.558
One, two-

18:59.894 --> 19:02.647
Two, three.

19:08.402 --> 19:11.155
I'm afraid this cart will be
stuck here until Sabbath next...

19:11.447 --> 19:14.200
unless I can gather
some hands to help.

19:14.492 --> 19:16.869
Would you care to ride with me?

19:17.161 --> 19:18.704
On your horse with you?

19:18.996 --> 19:21.165
Aye. Unless you can ride.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.710
I can ride.

19:25.002 --> 19:27.463
You take my horse,
and I'll take yours.

19:27.755 --> 19:33.010
<i>There's a, a shorter cut to the meeting
house, but it's difficult ground.</i>

19:33.302 --> 19:35.596
I shall manage, sir.

19:39.892 --> 19:42.019
Are you certain?

19:42.311 --> 19:44.897
Just you lead the way.

19:51.404 --> 19:53.739
Come on! Come on!

20:09.004 --> 20:11.632
Come on! Come on.

20:27.064 --> 20:29.525
May God be with you.

20:29.817 --> 20:31.569
I'm sure He already is.

20:33.571 --> 20:35.781
But aren't you coming to the-

20:57.136 --> 20:58.971
Good Sabbath to you all.

21:06.479 --> 21:10.483
Friends and fellow voyagers...

21:10.775 --> 21:12.985
in the greatest of all dreams,

21:14.278 --> 21:17.448
we have been singled out
like Israel of old...

21:17.740 --> 21:20.576
to serve as a model.

21:20.868 --> 21:23.245
But if we are to succeed...

21:23.537 --> 21:26.415
in building our new Jerusalem,

21:26.707 --> 21:30.169
our city on a hill,

21:30.461 --> 21:32.254
then the power of love,

21:34.673 --> 21:39.094
yea, His divine love,
must bind our hearts as one.

21:39.386 --> 21:42.807
English and Indian,

21:43.098 --> 21:45.935
gentry and indentured,
free man and slave.

21:46.227 --> 21:48.854
And make of us an example...

21:49.146 --> 21:52.942
for all the world
to marvel at and proclaim,

21:53.234 --> 21:55.528
"Here...

21:55.820 --> 21:58.656
"is the measure of perfection.

21:58.948 --> 22:00.825
"Here...

22:01.116 --> 22:03.369
"lives Gods own."

22:03.661 --> 22:05.955
But we are not succeeding
in that test.

22:06.247 --> 22:09.333
We are failing in that test.
And why?

22:09.625 --> 22:12.503
Because we covet, nay,

22:12.795 --> 22:16.507
we lust after what is not ours,

22:16.799 --> 22:19.134
be it the rich land
of our Indian brothers,

22:19.426 --> 22:22.054
be it for glory,

22:22.346 --> 22:25.182
for profit or for revenge.

22:25.474 --> 22:29.937
Need I read the secrets
of every heart?

22:30.229 --> 22:32.231
Yea, I will if you want.

22:32.523 --> 22:35.150
- Yea, I will if you want.
- I will lay open thy secrets...

22:35.442 --> 22:37.611
- before the eyes of God.
- I will lay open thy secrets...

22:37.903 --> 22:40.739
before the eyes of God!

22:41.031 --> 22:44.118
"Whatsoever thou lusteth after
is Mine enemy, " sayeth the Lord God,

22:44.410 --> 22:49.748
"for only I shall consume thee;
Only I shall fill thee up.

22:51.417 --> 22:54.420
"If thou failest to heed
My commandments,

22:54.712 --> 22:57.923
"then My fist
shall descend on thee...

22:58.215 --> 23:00.634
"like a stone.

23:00.926 --> 23:03.554
"And My sword shall cut thee
into bloody parts.

23:03.846 --> 23:06.557
"And even thy memory shall be
sacrificed to the winds...

23:06.849 --> 23:09.393
for all time."

23:09.685 --> 23:11.437
May God bless you,

23:13.272 --> 23:15.274
each and every one of you.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.528
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:19.820 --> 23:24.241
Arthur, allow me to present
a newcomer to our congregation,

23:24.533 --> 23:27.077
Mistress Roger Prynne.

23:27.369 --> 23:29.705
Mistress Roger...
- Aye, her husband, a most renowned physician,

23:29.997 --> 23:32.750
will be joining her... Reverend
Dimmesdale and I have already...

23:33.042 --> 23:36.170
I helped Mistress Prynne.
Her cart got stuck in the woods.

23:38.631 --> 23:41.091
I greatly enjoyed your sermon.

23:41.383 --> 23:45.304
It's rare for a man so young
to speak with such force of passion.

23:46.972 --> 23:51.393
Well, for some reason, I...
I felt most inspired today.

23:51.685 --> 23:55.064
We welcome you and your husband...
to our congregation.

23:58.484 --> 24:01.111
<i>Mother! Father! Can we play?</i>

24:11.288 --> 24:13.082
Ah, there you are, Hester.

24:13.374 --> 24:15.542
Meet my friend Running Moose.
He's our schoolmaster.

24:15.834 --> 24:18.045
- And I'm sure you'd like some refreshment.
- Why, yes.

24:18.337 --> 24:21.048
Do you teach the English children
as well, Mr. Running Moose?

24:21.340 --> 24:23.384
They call me John or Johnny
here in town.

24:23.676 --> 24:26.804
We try our best, but the English
are a bit slow-witted.

24:27.096 --> 24:29.598
- Slow-witted?
- Johnny's a bit of a jester,

24:29.890 --> 24:32.476
- but he was our first Praying Indian.
- Ahh.

24:32.768 --> 24:35.145
Ah, my best friend
in the colony.

24:35.437 --> 24:40.317
- Arthur, this is Mistress...
- Yes, we've already met.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.403
Excuse me.

24:48.534 --> 24:50.327
So like home.

24:50.619 --> 24:54.415
And yet beyond those trees,
I suspect a savage land...

24:54.707 --> 24:56.500
- of savage passions.
- All right?

24:56.792 --> 24:58.585
Dark and untamed.

25:00.212 --> 25:03.173
Oh, Reverend Dimmesdale,
have you met our young friend?

25:03.465 --> 25:08.762
Yes, we did.
- Yes, Mistress Prynne and I traveled on the same ship.

25:09.054 --> 25:11.515
- I'm going to marry him one day.
- No, you're not!

25:11.807 --> 25:14.935
I'm going to marry him, aren't I, Mistress Prynne?
- Marry whom?

25:15.227 --> 25:18.814
Rev. Dimmesdale, of course.

25:37.041 --> 25:40.919
Short Description of the
Great and Last judgment. Hmm.

25:41.211 --> 25:45.466
Oh, well.
A Platform for Church Discipline.

25:45.758 --> 25:48.719
Oh, they're all tracts.

25:55.142 --> 25:59.730
- The Good Wife's Manual...
- Manual for Animal Husbandry.

26:00.022 --> 26:01.732
I believe we've already met.

26:02.024 --> 26:04.234
Uh, yes. I-I'm sorry.
I- I didn't realize-

26:04.526 --> 26:06.403
No, no, no. I should've
announced my presence.

26:12.993 --> 26:14.912
Wh-What are you reading?

26:15.204 --> 26:17.790
- Uh, Camus. It's by John Mil-
- John Milton.

26:18.082 --> 26:20.959
- Yes, I know. I-I've read it.
- Have you?

26:21.251 --> 26:23.712
Well, I'm not all
counterpanes and coverlets.

26:24.004 --> 26:26.090
In every spare moment,
I am reading something.

26:27.591 --> 26:29.384
I'm the same.

26:29.676 --> 26:33.013
I've read every book in this room,
some of them several times.

26:33.305 --> 26:35.766
Even The Good Wife's Manual
for Animal Husbandry?

26:36.058 --> 26:37.768
A most exhilarating read.

26:49.988 --> 26:53.575
So... did you
truly enjoy my sermon?

26:53.867 --> 26:58.956
Oh, yes. It was most skillful. Clearly
your congregation reverences you.

26:59.248 --> 27:03.335
Obviously we don't come up to your London
standards here on the outskirts of the world.

27:03.627 --> 27:06.755
On the contrary, I was moved
by your passion, as I've said and-

27:08.340 --> 27:10.175
And?

27:12.052 --> 27:13.929
Uh, well.

27:16.348 --> 27:18.976
When your fist
struck your hand...

27:19.268 --> 27:22.271
and sliced through the air
like a sword,

27:22.563 --> 27:24.815
I found myself wondering...

27:25.107 --> 27:28.485
what manner of pain lay
beneath such forceful oratory.

27:30.821 --> 27:34.116
Your tongue knows no rules,
Mistress Prynne.

27:35.826 --> 27:39.288
And if it did, Reverend,
what purpose would it serve?

27:41.081 --> 27:46.336
And here I thought comprehending God
was going to be my greatest challenge.

27:54.511 --> 27:57.347
Yes, Reverend?

27:57.639 --> 28:01.852
This morning in the forest, why did you
not say that you were married?

28:02.144 --> 28:04.146
Why did you not say
you were a minister?

28:06.023 --> 28:08.609
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

28:20.579 --> 28:22.873
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne!

28:23.165 --> 28:26.001
- Good morrow.
- Do you care for a cup of cider?

28:26.293 --> 28:28.629
We are your neighbors, it seems.

28:28.921 --> 28:31.715
Did you like the sermon
this morning?

28:32.007 --> 28:35.177
From where I sat,
it seemed it did please thee.

28:35.469 --> 28:38.055
I liked it very much.

28:38.347 --> 28:41.225
- I thought the young minister very-
- Handsome?

28:43.310 --> 28:46.104
Harriet Hibbons.

28:49.233 --> 28:50.692
Ruth?

28:52.152 --> 28:53.946
How do you do?

28:54.238 --> 28:56.740
Come and meet some of the others
who were not invited...

28:57.032 --> 28:59.243
to the governor's little shindig.

28:59.534 --> 29:01.662
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

29:01.954 --> 29:04.623
- How do you do?
- I was on the dock when you arrived.

29:04.915 --> 29:06.708
Mary Rollings.

29:08.001 --> 29:11.505
Uh, Mary don't like
to speak too much.

29:11.797 --> 29:15.008
She's only been free
from the savages this half year.

29:15.300 --> 29:19.596
And Matona, she don't trust
the English, do you, dear?

29:19.888 --> 29:21.682
Mistress Prynne.

29:21.974 --> 29:23.809
Thank you, no. I never imbibe.

29:29.022 --> 29:31.275
I see you've gathered
some fine balm of Gilead,

29:31.566 --> 29:33.944
shepherd's purse, yarrow.

29:34.236 --> 29:35.946
You know your simples?

29:36.238 --> 29:38.240
Oh, I can recite
Culpeper by heart.

29:39.574 --> 29:41.451
Really?

29:44.830 --> 29:48.250
What simples would you use
to heal a bad burn?

29:48.542 --> 29:50.961
Well, I have seen sweet fern
work miracles,

29:51.253 --> 29:53.338
but Culpeper suggests
blackberry and red cedar.

29:53.630 --> 29:55.590
Well, you hear that?

29:58.010 --> 29:59.803
Well, I feel quite fortunate.

30:00.095 --> 30:03.598
My husband has a very large library,
and I was able to school myself.

30:03.890 --> 30:06.143
How do you like our new Jerusalem?

30:07.477 --> 30:09.313
Sober enough for you?

30:13.066 --> 30:15.193
Aye.

30:15.485 --> 30:17.446
Sober enough.

30:21.074 --> 30:24.369
What I miss is the dancing.

30:24.661 --> 30:27.372
- Dancing?
- When first we came,

30:27.664 --> 30:30.083
we'd dance around the maypole.

30:30.375 --> 30:33.003
Feast days, we'd sing bawdy songs.

30:33.295 --> 30:35.088
People weren't afraid
to play the fool.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.883
We'd teach the bears to dance.

30:38.175 --> 30:42.346
Nowadays everybody's getting
more sour-faced and ponderous.

30:42.637 --> 30:46.266
And a whipping post stands
where the maypole used to be.

30:46.558 --> 30:50.354
Well, there be a few of us who haven't
forgotten how to laugh, eh, girl?

30:54.983 --> 30:57.110
It's been such a pleasure
meeting you all.

30:57.402 --> 31:00.614
I'm sorry I must take my leave,
but I best be on my way.

31:00.906 --> 31:03.200
I would not want to be stuck
in the wilds at night.

31:03.492 --> 31:05.702
How strange that sounds to me.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.288
The wilds at night
are my natural territory,

31:08.580 --> 31:11.124
particularly when
there's a full moon.

31:11.416 --> 31:14.127
Do you try to frighten me
with this witch talk?

31:14.419 --> 31:17.923
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

31:18.215 --> 31:21.635
But I can see
what others cannot.

31:21.927 --> 31:24.554
It be a curse, to be sure,

31:24.846 --> 31:27.557
but I know the hearts of men.

31:28.975 --> 31:30.852
And what does my heart tell you?

31:33.438 --> 31:37.234
You're a most comely woman,
Mistress Prynne.

31:37.526 --> 31:41.238
But let a man tremble
who wins the hand of a maid,

31:41.530 --> 31:45.492
but possesses not
the full passion of her heart.

31:49.788 --> 31:51.998
My husband has nothing to fear.

31:53.166 --> 31:55.043
Good day, Mistress Hibbons.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.590
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.114
Oh, good day, Goody Gotwick.

32:24.406 --> 32:26.741
I've brought these
for Rev. Dimmesdale.

32:27.033 --> 32:29.453
The Reverend be occupied
with his work, missus.

32:29.744 --> 32:33.039
Leave them books on that table.
I'll be sure he gets them.

32:37.794 --> 32:39.588
Good morrow,
Reverend Dimmesdale.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.257
Oh, good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

32:42.549 --> 32:45.093
Knowing how you hunger
for new reading,

32:45.385 --> 32:47.929
I've brought you some books
from my husband's library.

32:49.347 --> 32:52.225
Hmm. How courteous of you.

32:55.687 --> 32:57.564
Please.

33:03.778 --> 33:07.991
I must apologize for my
forthrightness on Sabbath last.

33:08.283 --> 33:11.912
I've earned more than a few reprimands
in my life for speaking too bluntly.

33:13.872 --> 33:17.459
Well, I owe an apology too.

33:17.751 --> 33:21.463
Um, I-I can't understand
why I took such offense...

33:21.755 --> 33:24.591
to such an innocent comment.

33:26.801 --> 33:29.012
I- I have wondered...

33:30.430 --> 33:33.725
how you were able to, uh,

33:34.017 --> 33:35.810
see so deeply...

33:36.102 --> 33:37.812
into my nature.

33:38.104 --> 33:40.607
Perhaps I'm a witch.

33:53.954 --> 33:56.581
I must be keeping you
from your chores.

33:56.873 --> 34:00.210
Oh. There. Thank you
for the books, Mistress Prynne.

34:00.502 --> 34:03.004
Good day. Oh.

34:03.296 --> 34:06.550
I'm sorry.
My hands are covered in ink.

34:06.841 --> 34:09.594
I've been, uh,

34:09.886 --> 34:12.973
hovered over my translations all day.

34:13.264 --> 34:15.266
- Translations?
- Aye.

34:15.559 --> 34:17.435
I'm attempting to, um.

34:17.726 --> 34:21.773
Translate the Bible into the local
Indian language, Algonquin.

34:22.065 --> 34:25.235
What an ambitious undertaking.

34:25.527 --> 34:28.405
But I'm told the Indians
don't want to be guided by our Bible,

34:28.697 --> 34:30.407
that war with them is inevitable.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.076
Some think that way,
but they're wrong.

34:33.368 --> 34:36.413
It's just that the Indians, having been
born from a certain liberty,

34:36.705 --> 34:39.291
they take not easily
to the bridle and bit.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.376
No man should.

34:43.003 --> 34:44.879
Yes.

34:52.094 --> 34:56.266
What? What?

34:58.226 --> 35:00.145
You keep putting ink
on your face.

35:00.437 --> 35:02.939
I do? I'm sor-

35:09.654 --> 35:11.489
There you are.

35:16.369 --> 35:18.538
I do hope you enjoy the books.

35:18.830 --> 35:20.957
Uh, d-Thank you.

35:22.125 --> 35:26.129
Good day.

35:52.405 --> 35:53.990
Mituba.

35:56.409 --> 36:00.413
'Tis only a bathing tub,
not a toy of Satan.

39:02.136 --> 39:03.930
Mistress Prynne.

39:06.641 --> 39:08.351
Reverend Dimmesdale.

39:08.643 --> 39:10.562
You frightened me.

39:10.854 --> 39:12.730
Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

39:13.022 --> 39:16.651
No. It's a wonderful surprise.

39:19.779 --> 39:21.823
- It's beautiful.
- Ah, yes, and frightening.

39:23.408 --> 39:25.869
Just as Eden must have been.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.538
So untouched.

39:28.830 --> 39:31.332
Does it not cry out
with its promise...

39:31.624 --> 39:33.877
that here everything
can begin anew?

39:37.046 --> 39:39.716
I brought back your books.

39:40.008 --> 39:42.260
You couldn't have read
them all in four days.

39:42.552 --> 39:46.347
No, I did. I did.
I read most of them twice.

39:49.434 --> 39:51.644
Thank you.

39:51.936 --> 39:54.480
You're welcome.

39:54.772 --> 39:56.566
Farewell.

40:03.990 --> 40:07.744
Hester,
I- I'm not the man I seem.

40:09.662 --> 40:12.373
I've lived in this township
my whole life,

40:12.665 --> 40:14.542
my purpose clear.

40:14.834 --> 40:18.880
But now I would risk everything-
my life, my ministry, my soul-

40:19.172 --> 40:21.174
just to spend a few moments
alone with you.

40:23.009 --> 40:26.763
God help me, Hester,
I love thee.

40:30.099 --> 40:32.435
God help me, I love thee too.

40:36.648 --> 40:39.651
Oh, God, have we lost our way?

40:39.943 --> 40:41.736
No.

40:44.447 --> 40:46.824
I dreamed of thee
speaking thy heart.

40:47.116 --> 40:50.411
I have prayed for it
even as I have dreaded it.

40:52.163 --> 40:56.542
Was I alive
before I laid eyes on thee?

41:02.298 --> 41:04.133
What shall we do?

41:05.635 --> 41:07.470
I know not.

41:09.180 --> 41:13.726
Say something to end it,
for I-I have not the power.

41:15.478 --> 41:17.313
Nor I.

41:24.487 --> 41:26.322
Nay.

41:27.699 --> 41:30.535
We could be hanged for this.

41:39.544 --> 41:43.423
I- I've put you
in too much danger.

41:43.715 --> 41:47.927
And I must end it by walking away now
and never speaking with you again.

41:54.976 --> 41:57.854
Go, then.

41:58.146 --> 42:00.648
Do as you promised.

42:51.616 --> 42:54.535
<i>Throughout the long summer,
Mistress Prynne and Reverend Dimmesdale...</i>

42:54.827 --> 42:57.371
<i>avoided each other at all costs.</i>

42:57.663 --> 42:59.624
<i>Mistress Prynne
rarely ventured into town...</i>

42:59.916 --> 43:02.710
<i>and the Reverend escaped
into the wilds with only the Indians...</i>

43:03.002 --> 43:05.671
<i>and the faithful Johnny Sassamon
for company.</i>

43:09.967 --> 43:14.097
<i>And so the colony held
its annual election day as usual,</i>

43:14.388 --> 43:16.432
<i>no one the wiser that
there existed among them...</i>

43:16.724 --> 43:19.268
<i>two hearts struggling
against a love...</i>

43:19.560 --> 43:23.314
<i>- that grew stronger with each passing day.</i>
- <i>Company, halt!</i>

43:31.531 --> 43:35.368
Johnny Sassamon, Reverend,
Intrepid.

43:35.660 --> 43:39.122
What's he saying, Arthur?

43:39.413 --> 43:42.208
The Tarrantines attacked
an English ship,

43:42.500 --> 43:44.293
the Intrepid.

43:45.586 --> 43:47.672
All were massacred.

44:01.394 --> 44:03.563
Prynne.

44:03.855 --> 44:05.648
Dr. Roger Prynne.

44:40.892 --> 44:43.186
Mistress Prynne.

44:43.477 --> 44:46.272
Uh, I'm here as your minister.

44:49.650 --> 44:51.527
Come in.

45:02.496 --> 45:05.041
There was an attack,
an Indian attack,

45:05.333 --> 45:07.126
on one of our ships.

45:09.212 --> 45:11.547
They say that, uh.

45:11.839 --> 45:14.133
All aboard were massacred.

45:23.935 --> 45:29.315
I regret to be the-
the one to bring you this sad news.

45:29.607 --> 45:32.568
- I'll-I'll leave you to your mourning.
- No.

45:35.780 --> 45:39.408
Are you absolutely
certain none survived?

45:39.700 --> 45:42.954
They say that the tide
washed away the bodies.

45:43.246 --> 45:45.414
Oh, God forgive me.

45:45.706 --> 45:48.167
- I have prayed for so long to be set free.
- No.

45:48.459 --> 45:51.087
You did not cause
his death, Hester.

45:53.172 --> 45:55.800
God took your husband.

45:56.092 --> 46:00.137
Yes, but was it in answer to my prayers?
Does He work like that?

46:04.642 --> 46:07.728
Perhaps.

46:08.020 --> 46:12.441
If, in His eyes, there was no other way
that we could be together.

46:20.366 --> 46:22.827
I must know what the law is.

46:23.119 --> 46:25.663
The period of mourning-
How long must one wait?

46:25.955 --> 46:28.374
One month, six months, what?

46:31.168 --> 46:35.006
Well, in cases where there's
no absolute proof of death,

46:37.508 --> 46:41.721
seven years must pass before
we are free to be seen in public.

46:42.013 --> 46:43.806
Seven years?

46:46.142 --> 46:48.477
Aye.

53:15.906 --> 53:18.909
Release me or the army will follow.

53:42.933 --> 53:45.728
Were the Indians cruel to you, Mary?

53:46.019 --> 53:48.731
After my little one died,

53:49.022 --> 53:52.151
they treated me real fair and square.

53:52.443 --> 53:54.153
If truth be told,

53:54.445 --> 53:59.032
what's cruel is how ye folks
have treated me since I come home.

53:59.324 --> 54:02.745
I didn't do nothin'
that wasn't forced upon me.

54:03.036 --> 54:06.039
Just the thought of
being taken by a savage...

54:06.331 --> 54:08.751
makes me sick to my stomach.

54:09.042 --> 54:12.254
Well, they do it
on the backs of their horses,

54:12.546 --> 54:14.298
riding lickety-split
across the land.

54:18.927 --> 54:20.721
Hester, you all right?

54:21.013 --> 54:23.515
Yes, I'm well. Just tired.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.814
Mary's right.

54:31.106 --> 54:32.983
You call them savages?

54:33.275 --> 54:36.487
I could tell you a thing or two
about your late husband...

54:36.779 --> 54:39.490
before he tied the knot with you.

54:39.782 --> 54:41.492
You stupid slut.

54:41.784 --> 54:45.078
Harold would never have
had nothin' to do with no whore.

54:45.370 --> 54:47.080
Oh, you think not?

54:47.372 --> 54:50.584
I've even seen one of
your windy ministers...

54:50.876 --> 54:53.587
pokin' an injun girl.

54:53.879 --> 54:56.799
And standin' on a Bible
so he could roger her better.

54:57.090 --> 55:00.052
They always said the Scriptures
should uplift you.

55:07.518 --> 55:12.397
I refuse to be in the same room
with those who would mock the Holy Book.

55:18.862 --> 55:20.656
Well, well.

55:20.948 --> 55:23.951
- She'll not be coming back soon.
- Good riddance to her.

55:24.243 --> 55:28.413
We Quakers believe that the Scriptures
be not religion in itself,

55:28.705 --> 55:31.416
but only the ceremony
and history of it.

55:31.708 --> 55:33.418
I agree.

55:33.710 --> 55:36.922
For are not the laws of men
but the imagination of mortals...

55:37.214 --> 55:40.425
and our inner spirit
the true voice from heaven?

55:40.717 --> 55:44.263
Hester, I pray you're not suggesting
you talk directly to-

55:44.555 --> 55:46.265
to the Deity?

55:46.557 --> 55:50.269
Don't you know that only
well-paid Bible-thumpers can do that?

55:50.561 --> 55:53.772
Have a care, child,

55:54.064 --> 55:57.359
or they'll be talking of thee
the way they talk of me.

55:57.651 --> 56:02.906
Well, I know some consider it blasphemous
to say this, but I do talk to God.

56:03.198 --> 56:05.909
I have since I was
a small child.

56:06.201 --> 56:07.995
And He answers me.

56:24.970 --> 56:27.014
Mrs. Roger Prynne.

56:27.306 --> 56:30.058
By order of the governor of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony,

56:30.350 --> 56:33.437
you are ordered to appear
before the elders and magistrates...

56:33.729 --> 56:35.355
at 8:00 tomorrow morn.

56:40.235 --> 56:42.070
Do not be tardy.

56:44.823 --> 56:49.620
<i>Mistress Prynne, these gentlemen
lay a charge of heresy against you.</i>

56:49.912 --> 56:53.749
<i>Did you tell the others that the laws of
men are but the imagination of mortals?</i>

56:54.041 --> 56:56.251
<i>It is the meetings you call heresy?</i>

56:56.543 --> 56:58.754
<i>Lascivious talk
of fornication with savages;</i>

56:59.046 --> 57:02.257
<i>Fallen women telling blasphemous lies
about good citizens.</i>

57:02.549 --> 57:05.594
This is what comes when there is
no qualified man present...

57:05.886 --> 57:08.597
to guide these women in
their untutored chatterings.

57:08.889 --> 57:12.851
Sir, if the discourse of women
is "untutored chatterings, "

57:13.143 --> 57:16.939
why then does the Bible tell us that
women shall be the teachers of women?

57:23.195 --> 57:25.989
Hester, we ask that
you cease these meetings.

57:26.281 --> 57:30.452
- No, sirs, I will not stop the meetings.
- Arthur. Please join us.

57:32.579 --> 57:35.374
I've just returned
from fishing, sir.

57:35.666 --> 57:38.377
You may thank me to remain where I am.

57:38.669 --> 57:41.254
- Very well. Be seated.
- Let's call our first witness.

57:41.546 --> 57:43.256
Is it truly of import?

57:43.548 --> 57:46.259
Yes. Yes, it is of great consequence.

57:46.551 --> 57:48.762
Very well. Call your witnesses.

57:49.054 --> 57:51.974
Goody Gotwick.

57:52.265 --> 57:54.726
Stand up, please, Goody.

57:55.018 --> 57:58.355
Now, you revealed to my wife
something most disturbing.

57:58.647 --> 58:01.274
Tell me,
what does it mean when...

58:01.566 --> 58:03.276
a woman...

58:03.568 --> 58:05.529
vomits... in the morning hours,

58:05.821 --> 58:11.076
and vomits on more than one occasion
in the morning hours?

58:11.368 --> 58:14.246
I only saw her the one time.

58:15.747 --> 58:17.666
Yes? And?

58:21.420 --> 58:25.173
Um, twas Goody Mortimer
saw her get sick in the market.

58:30.762 --> 58:32.806
Are you with child, Mistress?

58:34.975 --> 58:36.852
Answer your betters, woman!

58:39.021 --> 58:43.066
Do you carry a bastard child
in your womb?

58:55.120 --> 58:56.997
Yes.

59:02.627 --> 59:04.504
Who is the father?

59:07.632 --> 59:11.845
You are an innocent next to the one
who would hide behind your skirts.

59:12.137 --> 59:14.890
We would hang that fornicator
by the neck.

59:16.975 --> 59:19.853
I will not reveal the name, sir.

59:22.731 --> 59:25.067
I will tell you his name.

59:29.780 --> 59:31.907
His name is Lucifer.

59:32.199 --> 59:34.618
His name is Lust.

59:34.910 --> 59:38.121
His name is Legion!

59:38.413 --> 59:40.207
Gentlemen.

59:43.627 --> 59:45.921
Gentlemen, what do you hope
to accomplish with this?

59:46.213 --> 59:49.758
You know very well there's no law against pregnancy.
- But there is against adultery.

59:50.050 --> 59:52.803
It would only be adultery
if her husband would prove to be alive.

59:54.971 --> 59:57.265
"Answer your betters, woman!

59:57.557 --> 01:00:01.478
"Are you carrying a bastard child?"

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.981
We could incarcerate her under adultery,
and the meetings will stop.

01:00:05.273 --> 01:00:07.984
Governor, if you knew
the name of this man,

01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:11.154
would you still place
Hester Prynne behind bars?

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:14.366
- Has she confessed the name to you?
- I've confessed nothing.

01:00:14.658 --> 01:00:16.910
- He knows nothing of my personal affairs!
- Give us the truth!

01:00:17.202 --> 01:00:20.163
He speaks as my pastor
to spare me your harsh hand,

01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:22.165
but I fear not your punishments.

01:00:22.457 --> 01:00:25.252
I love and honor the man
who has fathered this child.

01:00:25.544 --> 01:00:27.754
And say what you will,

01:00:28.046 --> 01:00:30.340
he is my true husband for life,

01:00:30.632 --> 01:00:34.052
and I shall furnish you with no
information which might cause him harm.

01:00:35.345 --> 01:00:38.140
Very well, Mistress,
you leave me no choice.

01:00:38.431 --> 01:00:40.225
You are under arrest.

01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:44.521
It's Hester!

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.033
God forgives you!

01:00:57.325 --> 01:00:59.828
And there's your new Jerusalem!

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.706
Just let me have a moment alone
with the woman, man!

01:01:02.998 --> 01:01:05.208
I'm sure I'd draw
the name from her.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.211
Very well, Arthur.
You shall have your chance, I promise.

01:01:08.503 --> 01:01:10.213
Gentlemen!

01:01:10.505 --> 01:01:13.216
I have considered all the arguments
and I have decided...

01:01:13.508 --> 01:01:16.636
that Arthur must be allowed to speak to Mistress Prynne
alone.
- No, no, no.

01:01:27.397 --> 01:01:31.193
Hester Prynne, place your hand
on the good book...

01:01:31.484 --> 01:01:33.278
and let us pray.

01:01:36.615 --> 01:01:38.491
Let us pray.

01:01:43.872 --> 01:01:46.541
Why did you not tell me?

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:49.878
I was afraid.

01:01:51.504 --> 01:01:54.382
I thought if I worked hard
I would miscarry.

01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:03.642
I must go to Bellingham
with the truth.

01:02:03.934 --> 01:02:07.646
No, you must not. You are a saint
to these people; They will hang you-

01:02:07.938 --> 01:02:11.775
Then I must hang than to allow you
to suffer in my stead.

01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:15.195
They've no case against me. When they're tired
of making their point, they'll release me.

01:02:15.487 --> 01:02:17.197
Hester, I know Stonehall.

01:02:17.489 --> 01:02:19.199
You've challenged him,

01:02:19.491 --> 01:02:24.079
and he will not release you until you
are humbled and have recanted your sins.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.415
Do you believe we've sinned?

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.756
Uh... I know not.

01:02:35.048 --> 01:02:37.759
What happened between us
had a consecration of its own.

01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:41.054
- We felt it so. Have you forgotten?
- I've not forgotten!

01:02:46.142 --> 01:02:48.937
Oh, Arthur, I know
you want to speak out.

01:02:49.229 --> 01:02:51.940
Everything in your nature
cries out for it.

01:02:52.232 --> 01:02:57.112
But you risk your own ruin and deny me
my right to stand up to this hypocrisy.

01:02:57.404 --> 01:02:59.155
<i>Soldier!</i>

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:12.294
If I need you to speak,

01:03:12.585 --> 01:03:15.338
I will tie this handkerchief
from the window.

01:03:18.591 --> 01:03:20.468
I love thee, woman.

01:03:22.846 --> 01:03:25.473
But your strength frightens me.

01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:29.853
I'll do what you ask.

01:03:36.693 --> 01:03:38.570
Amen.

01:03:46.578 --> 01:03:48.872
God be with you, Hester Prynne.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:54.377
I'm sure He already is.

01:04:05.555 --> 01:04:07.349
<i>Gentlemen, Mistress Prynne...</i>

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.352
<i>has been in that place
for over five months...</i>

01:04:10.643 --> 01:04:12.395
<i>without any legal justification.</i>

01:04:12.687 --> 01:04:16.441
<i>Even in backward Plymouth they regard
our treatment of this woman as barbaric!</i>

01:04:16.733 --> 01:04:19.444
<i>I would like nothing more than
to free her, Arthur.</i>

01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:21.863
At home I receive
no peace on this issue.

01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:25.909
The people have watched us go to her week after
week, caps in hand, only to be turned away.

01:04:26.201 --> 01:04:28.078
The woman is unbending,
unrepentant.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:31.206
She is very fortunate we have not
had her beaten publicly.

01:04:31.498 --> 01:04:35.043
I'm surprised at you, Rev. Cheever;
You came here a man of reason.

01:04:35.335 --> 01:04:39.422
I came here, sir, expecting to find
some semblance of order.

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:42.801
Instead I find
a den of factiousness.

01:04:43.093 --> 01:04:45.929
Now, sir, if you do not
stem this dissent,

01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:49.432
my wife and I have decided
to return to England...

01:04:49.724 --> 01:04:53.186
and to take all
our parishioners with us.

01:04:53.478 --> 01:04:57.565
If only she would give us
a small sign of contrition, Arthur.

01:05:00.944 --> 01:05:03.738
<i>Had it been up to him,</i>
<i>my father would have ended</i> it...

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.241
<i>and revealed
the truth of my origins.</i>

01:05:06.533 --> 01:05:08.243
- No visitors!
- Stand aside!

01:05:08.535 --> 01:05:11.246
<i>But, bound by my mother's wish, he could not.
- This is an innocent woman!</i>

01:05:11.538 --> 01:05:13.248
No visitors!

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.666
<i>- This is an abomination!</i>

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:18.086
<i>- He went every day to see
her: Every day he was refused.</i>

01:05:19.462 --> 01:05:21.256
<i>His eye ever on that window...</i>

01:05:21.548 --> 01:05:26.594
<i>for her sign that it was time
for him to come forward with the truth.</i>

01:07:32.303 --> 01:07:37.809
<i>Had there been flashes of Prynne's
unstable nature before in England,</i>

01:07:38.101 --> 01:07:39.894
<i>no one knows.</i>

01:07:41.813 --> 01:07:44.732
<i>But now,
freed from Puritan society,</i>

01:07:45.024 --> 01:07:49.737
<i>he was with increasing regularity
seized by spirits so powerful...</i>

01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:52.782
<i>they were terrifying
even to the Indians.</i>

01:08:12.343 --> 01:08:14.929
Forgive me, Lord,

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:18.933
for I have turned from Thee,
my heavenly Father.

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.019
Forgive me.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:24.939
Bring me back to Thy bosom.

01:08:27.108 --> 01:08:30.612
God's teeth, child,
how could they leave you thus?

01:08:30.903 --> 01:08:33.113
Oh, Harriet,
thank God you're here.

01:08:33.406 --> 01:08:35.617
Six months and not one visitor.

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:38.745
Now, now, some of us came, my dear,
but we were turned away.

01:08:39.037 --> 01:08:42.665
That slave of yours came every day.
How quick are the pains?

01:08:42.957 --> 01:08:44.667
They're not stopping.

01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:47.170
Here, now. Take a sip of this.

01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:50.631
I warrant you won't refuse
my cider this time.

01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:55.136
Rev. Dimmesdale tried all ways to get
you set at liberty. -

01:08:55.428 --> 01:08:57.138
- Another?
- Yes.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.140
All right, my dear.
There, now, breathe deep, breathe deep.

01:09:00.433 --> 01:09:04.812
I'm here. Hold onto me. Good girl.
Easy, easy. -

01:09:05.104 --> 01:09:07.314
Now, let me see. Let me see.

01:09:07.607 --> 01:09:10.818
All's well.
All's as it should be, now. It's close.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:13.821
It's very close.
Come, my dear, it's time.

01:09:14.113 --> 01:09:17.158
Up you sit. There's a good girl.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:20.161
Move down a little. Good.

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:25.207
Now this child is ready to be born.
We've work to do.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.210
There.

01:09:27.502 --> 01:09:30.712
I did not think they'd
keep me here so long.

01:09:31.005 --> 01:09:33.716
Oh. Well, I'll say this:

01:09:34.008 --> 01:09:36.844
You must have a will of iron.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:40.348
But when you take on the men,
it be to the death.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.850
- Oh! Easy!
- All right, my dear.

01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:45.645
Now, now, breathe deep.
Chin down.

01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:47.854
Bear down hard.

01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:50.858
More. And harder. Good girl!

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:54.194
Good girl. Good.
That's it, that's it.

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:58.199
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

01:09:58.491 --> 01:10:00.785
- Good, good.
- Ohh! Ohhh.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.167
Are you sure God's not punishing me?

01:10:08.459 --> 01:10:11.170
To be sure,
He's punishing you, woman.

01:10:11.462 --> 01:10:13.172
He be giving you a child.

01:10:13.464 --> 01:10:16.300
- It's coming!
- Now, gently, gently.

01:10:16.592 --> 01:10:19.303
- The head is coming I see it.
- Ohh! Yes! Yes!

01:10:19.595 --> 01:10:21.305
The head is through!

01:10:21.597 --> 01:10:24.851
Now, easy, easy. Easy.

01:10:25.143 --> 01:10:28.312
We've got the shoulders!

01:10:31.607 --> 01:10:33.818
- Ohh! Yes! Yes!
- She's here!

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:35.903
Ohh, thank you, God.

01:10:43.077 --> 01:10:45.288
Oh, yes.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.790
Oh, little Pearl.

01:10:48.082 --> 01:10:50.251
Yes. Yes, my-

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:52.962
She's here.

01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:55.047
Oh, she's here.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.117
Sit there, Mistress.

01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:28.080
Proceed, Reverend.

01:11:41.511 --> 01:11:45.807
I shall have them fetch fresh clothes
for you and the baby.

01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:01.447
I bring good news.

01:12:01.739 --> 01:12:04.909
I have prevailed
upon the governor.

01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:07.495
You are to be freed.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.543
But by law...

01:12:13.835 --> 01:12:16.629
you will be brought
to the scaffold...

01:12:17.755 --> 01:12:19.632
for reprimand.

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:23.803
Hester,

01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:26.347
whatever is said,

01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:30.476
please... be as contrite
as your conscience will permit.

01:12:30.768 --> 01:12:33.688
If not for my sake,
then for the babe's.

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.816
I beg you,
do not anger them any furth-

01:12:42.446 --> 01:12:44.740
I come to baptize the babe.

01:13:05.803 --> 01:13:09.056
I have died not seeing you.

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:11.100
I came every day.

01:13:49.013 --> 01:13:51.390
I baptize this child...

01:13:54.602 --> 01:13:56.437
Pea?.

01:13:57.605 --> 01:13:59.440
Pea?.

01:14:06.822 --> 01:14:09.075
In the name of the Father...

01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.078
and the Son...

01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:16.749
and the Holy Ghost.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.587
May the Lord bless thee...

01:14:23.464 --> 01:14:25.299
and care for thee...

01:14:26.676 --> 01:14:28.594
and watch over thee.

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:33.599
Amen.

01:14:41.524 --> 01:14:43.734
Freeing this woman...

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:48.447
will be an invitation
to every wife to defy her husband;

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:51.367
Every child its parent.

01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.369
No, no, she should be released.

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:55.371
What?

01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:57.873
Horace,
you don't put her in the prison.

01:14:58.165 --> 01:15:00.376
You put the prison in her...

01:15:00.668 --> 01:15:03.379
so that each time
someone sets eyes on her,

01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:06.465
her sin will be marked
into her soul afresh.

01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:16.183
Cunningly contrived, my dear.

01:15:20.271 --> 01:15:22.565
Make way in the king's name.

01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:26.193
Our blessing on the righteous colony
of Massachusetts...

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:30.114
where iniquity is dragged
into the sunlight.

01:15:30.406 --> 01:15:33.409
Know, all men, by these present,

01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:36.746
that Mistress Roger Prynne...

01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:39.331
has been ordered
to bear punishment...

01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:43.919
for the crimes of
fornication and adultery.

01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.922
You bring shame upon
this good community!

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:51.677
If it be determined at a later date
that her husband be still alive,

01:15:51.969 --> 01:15:54.680
she may face
a more severe penalty,

01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:57.933
which is to be hanged
by the neck until dead.

01:15:58.225 --> 01:15:59.977
Pray, silence...

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:03.814
for His Excellency the Governor!

01:16:04.106 --> 01:16:06.233
Hester Prynne,

01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:09.278
though you show no modesty
in your apparel,

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.617
yet you have a chance still
to repent your sins.

01:16:14.909 --> 01:16:16.952
Yes, Hester, repent!

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.416
Child, do you not believe
that you have sinned?

01:16:24.502 --> 01:16:27.379
I believe I have sinned
in your eyes.

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.884
But who's to know
if God shares your views?

01:16:32.176 --> 01:16:36.430
Woman, transgress not against
the limits of heaven's mercy. -

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:40.434
Good Master Dimmesdale,
you are her pastor.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:44.021
Speak to her, for all our sakes!

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:47.942
Soften her, her hardness,
her obstinacy!

01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:52.238
' <i>Speak!</i>
' <i>Speak!</i>

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.240
<i>Listen to the reverend!</i>

01:16:54.532 --> 01:16:56.742
Speak to the woman, my brother.

01:16:57.034 --> 01:16:59.286
Exhort her to confess the truth.

01:17:05.084 --> 01:17:06.961
Hester Prynne,

01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:11.632
you hear what
these good men say...

01:17:11.924 --> 01:17:15.094
and you can see the accountability
under which I labor.

01:17:17.388 --> 01:17:19.765
For your soul's peace,

01:17:22.017 --> 01:17:24.103
I charge thee,

01:17:24.395 --> 01:17:26.397
speak out the name...

01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:28.691
of your fellow sinner.

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:36.240
Be not silent...

01:17:36.532 --> 01:17:39.702
from some mistaken pity
or tenderness for him.

01:17:39.994 --> 01:17:42.746
For, believe me, if he could
step down from a high place...

01:17:43.038 --> 01:17:46.250
and stand there beside you
on your pedestal of shame,

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.711
it would be better...

01:17:49.003 --> 01:17:52.339
than to carry a guilty heart
through life.

01:17:54.925 --> 01:17:57.845
What can your silence
do for him...

01:17:59.847 --> 01:18:02.391
except to tempt him,

01:18:02.683 --> 01:18:05.019
compel him, as it were,

01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:07.563
to add hypocrisy to sin?

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:13.152
Speak.

01:18:28.292 --> 01:18:30.085
She will not speak.

01:18:30.377 --> 01:18:33.505
<i>In the name of the Lord, name him!
Name him!</i>

01:18:37.218 --> 01:18:40.429
- <i>Speak! Speak!</i>
<i>- What is his name?</i>

01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:42.598
<i>Who might he be?</i>

01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:59.198
Very well. Beadle.

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:02.368
Mistress,
if you do not speak out the name,

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.370
you must wear
upon your bodice...

01:19:04.662 --> 01:19:06.914
this symbol of
your sinful fornication.

01:19:20.094 --> 01:19:23.806
Heed not this final warning...

01:19:24.098 --> 01:19:27.309
and from this day forward
you will be a pariah,

01:19:27.601 --> 01:19:31.897
cut off, shunned and reviled by every
man, woman and child in this town.

01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:40.447
Why do you wait? Put it on.

01:19:40.739 --> 01:19:44.243
For 'tis not a badge of my shame,
but your own.

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.005
Unrepentant whore!

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:10.686
Now is she without...

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.505
What do you want?

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:43.260
Have I changed so much, my beloved,
that you would slay me...

01:20:43.552 --> 01:20:46.347
even as I resurrect myself
from the dead?

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.687
Roger?

01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:15.376
Hester.

01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:23.342
Was I ever unkind to you?

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.762
Did I not love thee?

01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:30.766
Did I not set thee
above all womankind?

01:21:31.058 --> 01:21:33.936
Are you not bound to me
by sacred oath?

01:21:34.228 --> 01:21:38.065
Or has this new land
turned thee into a heathen?

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:47.574
Lay down our bed,
wilt thou, wife?

01:22:13.517 --> 01:22:15.811
Pray for thy sins,
Hester Prynne.

01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:18.814
Beg the Lord to
forgive thy corruption.

01:22:19.106 --> 01:22:22.901
Pray, and I will wash thee
white as snow.

01:22:26.155 --> 01:22:27.948
White as snow, my love.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.492
Oh, yes. White as snow.

01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:38.625
White as snow.

01:23:20.751 --> 01:23:22.628
Arthur!

01:23:29.343 --> 01:23:31.136
Hester!

01:23:31.428 --> 01:23:35.140
- Oh, thank God you're here.
- Hester, why are you taking this risk?

01:23:35.432 --> 01:23:37.643
I had to warn you; My husband-

01:23:37.935 --> 01:23:39.645
Oh, Arthur, he's alive.

01:23:39.937 --> 01:23:41.688
Oh, dear God.

01:23:44.358 --> 01:23:46.485
Alive?

01:23:46.777 --> 01:23:48.946
Now we will hang for certain.

01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:53.242
Why would your husband show up at this very
moment if he was not God's dark messenger...

01:23:53.534 --> 01:23:55.953
sent to punish us?

01:23:56.245 --> 01:23:58.956
Arthur, you must leave
this place without us.

01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:04.211
Please. I cannot bear to see you trapped
here under his watchful eye forever.

01:24:04.503 --> 01:24:08.257
Hester, I cannot leave. I must
stay and watch over you and Pearl.

01:24:08.549 --> 01:24:10.759
No! You don't know him.

01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.762
He will wait for us
to betray each other...

01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:16.765
with the slightest glance
or the merest gesture.

01:24:17.057 --> 01:24:19.268
Please, you must go.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.188
This is God's punishment...

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.233
because we tried to run
from His will.

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:45.836
I will not say farewell, Hester,

01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:48.922
for God will watch over you.

01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.843
And so will I.

01:24:55.846 --> 01:24:57.639
Kiss Pearl for me...

01:24:57.931 --> 01:24:59.725
each night.

01:25:27.544 --> 01:25:30.881
'Tis easy to see
the mother's part in her.

01:25:32.299 --> 01:25:35.093
Is it beyond
the philosopher's research, I wonder,

01:25:35.385 --> 01:25:37.095
to analyze her nature...

01:25:37.387 --> 01:25:41.642
and from its make and mold to give
a shrewd guess as to the father?

01:25:42.934 --> 01:25:44.728
What are your expectations, sir?

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.274
I do not expect your heart
to return to me quickly,

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:53.153
but I hope one day you will draw me again
into your heart's innermost chambers.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.784
God help me, love has forced
my heart to open to another.

01:25:59.076 --> 01:26:00.827
Watch your tongue, woman.

01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:04.289
It is this phantom lover
who puts these words into your mouth.

01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:08.794
Where is he, woman? Is his kiss
still wet on your lips, on your breast?

01:26:09.086 --> 01:26:12.798
I demand to know!
- If I could spend six months in a cold jail...

01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:14.800
and not tell those iron men,

01:26:15.092 --> 01:26:17.803
what makes you think
I will tell you now?

01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:22.808
I have grown strong through these trials,
sir, and I am not the child you married!

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.019
Why not announce yourself openly
and cast me off at once?

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:28.939
No. No.

01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:31.942
I seek no vengeance
against you, child.

01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:35.320
But the man lives
who has wronged us both.

01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:38.949
He bears no letter of infamy
wrought into his garment,

01:26:39.241 --> 01:26:42.160
but I shall read it...
on his heart.

01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:46.248
Breathe one word to him
of my true identity...

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.334
and you will both hang.

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:52.087
And if you're foolish enough
to attempt an escape,

01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:54.548
you'll be easily tracked
and found. Easily.

01:26:57.008 --> 01:26:59.219
From the savages...

01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:03.724
I have learned patience,
Hester Prynne.

01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:44.431
Mmm. Goody Gotwick, thank you.

01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:01.782
Reverend Dimmesdale, allow me
to introduce our newest boarder,

01:28:02.073 --> 01:28:04.284
- Dr. Chilling-
- Chillingworth.

01:28:04.576 --> 01:28:06.453
- Chillingworth.
- Yes. Yes.

01:28:06.745 --> 01:28:08.455
Good day, Reverend.

01:28:08.747 --> 01:28:10.499
- Good day, sir.
- Mmm.

01:28:13.168 --> 01:28:16.963
What, uh, brings you
to our colony, Doctor?

01:28:17.255 --> 01:28:22.052
I'm a physician, sir, that would
cleanse the ills of the community.

01:28:26.681 --> 01:28:28.892
Have I said something strange?

01:28:31.186 --> 01:28:34.189
N- No. No, it's just, uh-

01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:36.274
Oh, I'm amazed.

01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:39.986
We have prayed...

01:28:40.278 --> 01:28:41.947
for a skilled physician.

01:28:44.741 --> 01:28:47.661
I see you're translating
the Bible into Algonquin.

01:28:50.038 --> 01:28:52.791
A most difficult tongue
to master.

01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:56.962
If I can be of help, Reverend,

01:28:57.254 --> 01:29:00.090
I am quite fluent in Algonquin.

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:02.384
Uh, fluent?

01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:05.929
Oh, yes. I was a prisoner
of the Tarrantine.

01:29:06.221 --> 01:29:08.932
When I spoke improperly,
I was whipped.

01:29:09.224 --> 01:29:11.518
To be certain,
I learned quite rapidly.

01:29:13.186 --> 01:29:15.730
How were you captured?

01:29:17.232 --> 01:29:19.526
I was working my farm
in Virginia.

01:29:19.818 --> 01:29:23.947
They came, they killed
my wife Eleanor, God rest her soul,

01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.700
and our infant son,

01:29:26.992 --> 01:29:29.035
and sold me into captivity.

01:29:32.205 --> 01:29:33.999
Well, uh-

01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:38.003
Well, it's a wonder that you're not
consumed with, uh, bitterness and despair.

01:29:38.295 --> 01:29:42.048
No, no, no. In truth, sir,
I am in debt to the Indians.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.050
Some say they are savages,

01:29:44.342 --> 01:29:47.178
but I find true savagery
to reside...

01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:49.222
elsewhere.

01:29:59.524 --> 01:30:01.401
Mrs. Roger Prynne.

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:05.238
Mistress Prynne.

01:30:10.285 --> 01:30:12.287
And what is your duty, boy?

01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:15.332
To follow you around
in every public place, Mistress.

01:30:15.624 --> 01:30:18.418
Well, at least
they'll make a path for me.

01:30:46.821 --> 01:30:49.991
<i>- Whore!</i>
- <i>God will punish you, sinner!</i>

01:30:50.283 --> 01:30:52.077
<i>Jezebel</i>

01:30:53.286 --> 01:30:55.580
<i>You're not welcome here!</i>

01:30:55.872 --> 01:30:58.917
<i>Begone, Hester Prynne!</i>

01:30:59.209 --> 01:31:00.961
She's a whore!

01:31:06.633 --> 01:31:09.469
Soap, please. Three pieces.

01:31:36.162 --> 01:31:39.708
<i>Although he wore
no outward symbol of his shame,</i>

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.294
<i>my father bore his own scarlet letter
on the very bosom of his soul.</i>

01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:49.009
<i>The pain of their separation
must have affected us all,</i>

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.012
<i>for I was indeed
a troublesome child.</i>

01:31:52.303 --> 01:31:55.015
<i>His heart aching for my mother,</i>

01:31:55.306 --> 01:31:59.185
<i>my father sought to fill his loneliness
in the wilds with johnny...</i>

01:31:59.477 --> 01:32:02.230
<i>as they struggled
to keep alive their dream...</i>

01:32:02.522 --> 01:32:05.608
<i>of building a bridge
between the English and the Indians.</i>

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.821
Johnny, why are they
so close to town?

01:32:11.072 --> 01:32:14.200
They say that our people
have fallen asleep,

01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:18.079
so they must remain
awake for all of us.

01:32:19.539 --> 01:32:21.332
I'm worried, Arthur.

01:32:21.624 --> 01:32:23.835
Is war coming?

01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:26.880
The great experiment
is not working, is it?

01:32:36.723 --> 01:32:38.475
Yes, he's right.

01:32:38.767 --> 01:32:41.227
If there is a war, how do we stop
our Praying Indians...

01:32:41.519 --> 01:32:44.689
from rising up and
slitting our throats as we sleep?

01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:46.733
Faith, Thomas, faith.

01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:50.278
I know what will stop them.

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:53.073
Arthur's friendship
with Johnny Sassamon.

01:32:53.364 --> 01:32:55.825
Johnny would never betray Arthur.

01:32:56.117 --> 01:32:58.870
He worships him
as Peter worshipped Jesus.

01:32:59.162 --> 01:33:00.914
Gentlemen. Doctor.

01:33:04.834 --> 01:33:08.254
If there is a true war,
God help us all,

01:33:08.546 --> 01:33:11.758
because neither we
nor the savages will survive it.

01:33:15.804 --> 01:33:19.641
I see the governor has less of
an appreciation for signs than ye,

01:33:19.933 --> 01:33:21.768
his Godly advisors.

01:33:23.144 --> 01:33:25.605
It is not always easy.

01:33:25.897 --> 01:33:29.442
Strangely, the same thing
happened in Virginia.

01:33:30.652 --> 01:33:32.445
Before the attack,

01:33:32.737 --> 01:33:34.948
there were signs
that went unheeded.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.867
Oh? And what manner of signs?

01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:40.662
The bad winter;
The crop failures;

01:33:40.954 --> 01:33:44.999
Far too many Quakers
and foreigners in the town;

01:33:47.043 --> 01:33:50.588
Some minor elements of witchcraft,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.966
Exactly. Exactly.

01:33:53.258 --> 01:33:56.302
Our first sign was that matter
of Hester Prynne...

01:33:56.594 --> 01:33:58.304
and her women's meetings.

01:33:58.596 --> 01:34:02.433
And after that, the severe winter,
the failed crops.

01:34:02.725 --> 01:34:04.435
You see. Sir.

01:34:04.727 --> 01:34:09.190
My colleague has feared from the start
that in the matter of Mistress Prynne,

01:34:09.482 --> 01:34:11.192
witchcraft was involved.

01:34:11.484 --> 01:34:14.195
Mmm. Then why, in all this time,

01:34:14.487 --> 01:34:18.199
have you not taken the proper measures
to cleanse your colony?

01:34:18.491 --> 01:34:20.702
What measures
do you speak of, sir?

01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:24.330
Did you examine the women present
at those meetings?

01:34:24.622 --> 01:34:27.083
Have you queried the midwife...

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:30.670
or inspected the child
for the witch's marks?

01:34:38.344 --> 01:34:42.390
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.

01:34:42.682 --> 01:34:46.644
<i>"For Thou art with me; Thy rod
and Thy staff, they comfort me.</i>

01:34:46.936 --> 01:34:50.231
<i>"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.</i>

01:34:50.523 --> 01:34:53.860
<i>"Thou anointeth my head with oil;
My cup runneth over.</i>

01:34:54.152 --> 01:34:58.698
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.</i>

01:34:58.990 --> 01:35:01.910
<i>',I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."</i>

01:35:04.746 --> 01:35:07.582
The babe's clean at present.

01:35:07.874 --> 01:35:11.127
Mistress, we shall leave
your child with you for the present.

01:35:11.419 --> 01:35:14.214
But you must assure us
it will be raised a Christian.

01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:18.968
Yes, yes. Ooh.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.846
Yes. Yes.

01:35:22.138 --> 01:35:24.766
Yes.

01:35:30.813 --> 01:35:34.484
I've been your friend today, child,
but it cannot always be so.

01:35:34.776 --> 01:35:36.486
No.

01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:40.448
For inside me, I grow
more wretched by the day.

01:35:49.249 --> 01:35:52.001
I yearn so much for thee.

01:35:53.878 --> 01:35:58.841
And I fear I might destroy
the whole world to win thee back.

01:36:23.658 --> 01:36:27.161
<i>Come now and tell old Harriet
what's troubling you.</i>

01:36:27.453 --> 01:36:29.622
I never imagined...

01:36:29.914 --> 01:36:32.709
how cruel and cunning
their punishment could be.

01:36:36.796 --> 01:36:40.174
Stonehall and Cheever stopping
to preach at me on the streets.

01:36:41.467 --> 01:36:44.137
The people pointing
and shouting,

01:36:44.429 --> 01:36:46.180
even the children.

01:36:49.892 --> 01:36:52.770
And that horrible drummer boy
following me everywhere.

01:36:56.691 --> 01:36:59.027
Perhaps it was all for naught.

01:37:04.324 --> 01:37:08.703
I wonder if existence as a woman
is worthwhile at all,

01:37:08.995 --> 01:37:10.955
even for the happiest of women.

01:37:12.332 --> 01:37:14.208
Courage, child.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:18.254
Take heart. At least you've known
what it is to love.

01:37:18.546 --> 01:37:22.633
But what if I've repaid that love
by destroying him?

01:37:22.925 --> 01:37:24.844
What if...

01:37:25.136 --> 01:37:27.889
everything I believed
so strongly was a lie,

01:37:31.351 --> 01:37:34.145
vain and selfish?

01:37:51.579 --> 01:37:55.291
<i>Prynne's punishments
were succeeding in their cruel work.</i>

01:37:55.583 --> 01:37:58.795
<i>The seasons ran their course.</i>

01:37:59.087 --> 01:38:01.464
<i>The distance between them
was impassable.</i>

01:38:04.467 --> 01:38:08.096
<i>My mother took the terrible risk
of writing to my father,</i>

01:38:08.388 --> 01:38:13.059
<i>reminding him to hold steadfast
in their love and keep his silence,</i>

01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:15.812
aware that Prynne's subtle
but constant presence...

01:38:16.104 --> 01:38:20.525
<i>was causing an inner torment
that threatened my father's very soul.</i>

01:38:24.028 --> 01:38:28.741
<i>As for Prynne, his lust for revenge
began to feed on itself,</i>

01:38:29.033 --> 01:38:31.077
<i>so that he hungered for more.</i>

01:38:37.125 --> 01:38:39.502
Good morrow, Mituba.

01:38:43.089 --> 01:38:45.049
What a pleasant day for a ride.

01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:51.264
Oh, Mituba.

01:38:51.556 --> 01:38:55.810
You're renowned in town for your loyalty
to your mistress, and now I see why.

01:38:57.562 --> 01:39:02.150
Was your dry lunch
a communication from her lover?

01:39:06.779 --> 01:39:11.367
You know, I have the power to arrest
you as an accomplice to adultery...

01:39:11.659 --> 01:39:15.371
and bring you before
the magistrates for questioning.

01:39:17.039 --> 01:39:21.210
And since you are a slave,
they might well whip you to death.

01:39:21.502 --> 01:39:25.131
Easy! Easy! Easy!

01:39:26.424 --> 01:39:29.886
I only want to help
the woman we both love...

01:39:30.178 --> 01:39:32.638
to free herself
from the grasp of a fiend.

01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:35.099
Oh, dear Lord, this is it!

01:39:35.391 --> 01:39:38.686
He made you strip naked
before him, hmm?

01:39:41.772 --> 01:39:44.567
Totally naked?

01:39:44.859 --> 01:39:48.070
Was there a presence in the room?

01:39:48.362 --> 01:39:50.406
Now, think, think!

01:39:50.698 --> 01:39:52.742
He might have come
in one of his many disguises.

01:39:53.034 --> 01:39:54.827
Did he come as a bird?

01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:57.747
Ah, a blackbird!

01:39:58.039 --> 01:40:01.417
Was the bird black?

01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:03.503
Oh, God,

01:40:03.794 --> 01:40:06.130
I feel the presence of Lucifer!

01:40:06.422 --> 01:40:08.841
Save yourself, child, before it is too late!
- Gentlemen, phrase.

01:40:09.133 --> 01:40:11.802
Please, gentlemen, please!
Enough. Enough.

01:40:13.054 --> 01:40:14.889
Enough.

01:40:17.475 --> 01:40:19.268
Go home, Mituba.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.021
You've been a wondrous help.

01:40:22.313 --> 01:40:25.024
Commend us to your mistress.

01:40:25.316 --> 01:40:27.068
Go home.

01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:42.208
So there is a malignancy
to be cut out here.

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:45.211
But what kind of witness
will a slave be in court?

01:40:45.503 --> 01:40:48.297
The bird, obviously,
is Harriet Hibbons.

01:40:57.598 --> 01:40:59.433
What is it, Pearl?

01:41:01.936 --> 01:41:03.729
Forgive me, Hester.

01:41:04.021 --> 01:41:06.524
Harriet!
- Yours was the first place I thought of to hide.

01:41:06.816 --> 01:41:08.818
What is it?

01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:12.071
Th-The militia,
they've broken into my house.

01:41:12.363 --> 01:41:14.115
They're looking for me
in the woods.

01:41:20.788 --> 01:41:23.082
I've been named...

01:41:23.374 --> 01:41:26.085
as a witch.

01:41:26.377 --> 01:41:28.421
In the name of God.

01:41:28.713 --> 01:41:30.506
What?

01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:39.849
- Hold here.
- Yes, sir!

01:41:45.896 --> 01:41:48.065
What's the meaning
of this intrusion, Major?

01:41:48.357 --> 01:41:51.235
Stand aside, woman.
We know the witch is in here.

01:41:51.527 --> 01:41:55.197
There's no one inside but myself,
my child and Mistress Mituba.

01:41:55.489 --> 01:41:57.783
So, unless you have a warrant,
be gone.

01:41:59.869 --> 01:42:02.622
Reverend Dimmesdale.

01:42:02.913 --> 01:42:04.498
What's happening, Major?

01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:08.085
It appears that we've
cornered ourselves a witch.

01:42:08.377 --> 01:42:12.381
Hmm? Here in
Hester Prynne's Cottage.

01:42:12.673 --> 01:42:15.968
Well, if there is a witch
inside the house, Major,

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.597
I'm sure I'll find her.

01:42:22.058 --> 01:42:23.934
Aye.

01:42:26.062 --> 01:42:28.606
Front and back.
One at the door. Magistrate?

01:42:28.898 --> 01:42:30.650
Sir. Hup!

01:42:57.218 --> 01:42:59.095
Pearl's grown tall.

01:43:02.264 --> 01:43:05.559
She is an elf. Willful.

01:43:07.269 --> 01:43:09.146
Dear God, Hester.

01:43:14.944 --> 01:43:16.987
It's been so long.

01:43:20.074 --> 01:43:21.909
You're thin.

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:32.002
Are you hiding someone, Hester?

01:43:36.424 --> 01:43:39.176
Why do you-

01:43:39.468 --> 01:43:42.221
Why are you risking...

01:43:42.513 --> 01:43:44.473
further anger from the elders?

01:43:44.765 --> 01:43:47.393
Because Mistress Hibbons
is no witch...

01:43:47.685 --> 01:43:49.937
and she's committed no crime
beyond speaking her mind.

01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:52.273
Well, if she is innocent,

01:43:52.565 --> 01:43:56.110
I assure you
no harm will befall her.

01:43:56.402 --> 01:43:58.612
Arthur.

01:43:58.904 --> 01:44:02.992
After all that has happened,
how can you still trust these iron men?

01:44:05.035 --> 01:44:07.747
Do you not see
what is happening?

01:44:08.038 --> 01:44:10.249
Last month they brought
Sally Short in for questioning.

01:44:10.541 --> 01:44:13.419
<i>They held her for two days.
Last week it was Mary Railings.</i>

01:44:13.711 --> 01:44:16.088
<i>They were just
questioning them!</i>

01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:19.425
- What is the crime in that?
- The crime is they had done nothing!

01:44:19.717 --> 01:44:23.220
Do you not see that this
is all part of some malevolence?

01:44:23.512 --> 01:44:25.222
What has become of you?

01:44:25.514 --> 01:44:27.266
God, woman!

01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:36.275
By order of your demands,
I've given up everything I hold sacred.

01:44:36.567 --> 01:44:38.611
I'm in hell!

01:44:38.903 --> 01:44:42.281
In the eye of the enemy, your husband,
who lectures at my side day and night...

01:44:42.573 --> 01:44:45.868
and in the eye of every parishioner
who comes to me to unburden their soul,

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.662
I'm a pollution, woman!
I'm a lie!

01:44:48.954 --> 01:44:50.664
Nay.

01:44:50.956 --> 01:44:53.667
They are the pollution.
They are the lie.

01:44:53.959 --> 01:44:57.129
But you are allowing them to destroy
everything that is good in you!

01:44:57.421 --> 01:45:00.382
Oh, what has happened
to the man I love?

01:45:00.674 --> 01:45:02.384
Does he not still
live inside thee?

01:45:02.676 --> 01:45:06.138
Our love, woman, was a folly.

01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:08.682
And the voice that we heard
was a false one...

01:45:08.974 --> 01:45:11.352
and we have been justly punished
for listening to it!

01:45:11.644 --> 01:45:14.605
<i>Coward, bestow yourself
with Courage!</i>

01:45:17.358 --> 01:45:19.276
Hold, woman!

01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.215
What have I become?

01:46:22.923 --> 01:46:28.053
<i>To have betrayed the only person
on earth who had shown her kindness-</i>

01:46:28.345 --> 01:46:31.265
<i>- What could feel worse than that?
- Mituba.</i>

01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:34.059
<i>Poor mute Mituba.</i>

01:46:34.351 --> 01:46:37.062
<i>When Prynne summoned her,
she wanted only to undo the harm...</i>

01:46:37.354 --> 01:46:39.648
<i>she might have caused
her mistress.</i>

01:46:41.275 --> 01:46:44.528
Peace in this house!

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.406
Peace, I say. Peace!

01:46:47.698 --> 01:46:51.535
You find these proceedings
humorous, Mistress Hibbons?

01:46:53.162 --> 01:46:57.583
Do you expect me
to take 'em seriously?

01:46:57.875 --> 01:47:01.420
Seeing a bunch of grown men
poking around my private parts,

01:47:01.712 --> 01:47:04.340
looking for witch's marks?

01:47:06.967 --> 01:47:10.804
- The slave Mituba-
- Peace, I say! Peace!

01:47:11.096 --> 01:47:13.766
I'm afraid a witness,
the slave Mituba,

01:47:14.058 --> 01:47:15.768
has been found dead.

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.811
What?

01:47:19.813 --> 01:47:23.108
<i>Governor, you see?
I told you she was a witch!</i>

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.653
<i>Mistress Hibbons is a witch!</i>

01:47:25.945 --> 01:47:28.405
<i>- She is a witch!</i>
- <i>Witch! Witch!</i>

01:47:33.535 --> 01:47:36.121
Have you lost all reason?
Who gave her the right to speak?

01:47:36.413 --> 01:47:39.792
There is no witchcraft here!
This is murder!

01:47:40.084 --> 01:47:43.921
- Guards, restrain this woman!
- Hang the witch!

01:47:45.714 --> 01:47:48.467
Satan is not at work here
among the women!

01:47:48.759 --> 01:47:52.638
But if he is here, then perhaps
he is at work here among you men.

01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:54.306
Hear Satan speak.

01:47:54.598 --> 01:47:57.393
Governor! Governor!

01:47:57.685 --> 01:48:00.062
Governor, I have evidence
to render.

01:48:00.354 --> 01:48:02.982
As you know, Mistress Hibbons...

01:48:03.273 --> 01:48:06.402
midwived Mistress Prynne's...

01:48:06.694 --> 01:48:08.487
baby Pearl.

01:48:14.326 --> 01:48:17.162
- Want a sweet, Pearl?
- Bastard!

01:48:22.418 --> 01:48:26.338
- No!
- Yes, my Pearl.

01:48:28.215 --> 01:48:30.134
How I wish you were my girl.

01:48:35.556 --> 01:48:38.350
Poor fatherless child.

01:48:38.642 --> 01:48:41.270
Now, would you like
to learn a game?

01:48:46.608 --> 01:48:49.778
Now, yes. Now, do what I do.

01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:52.197
If I pinch my nose.

01:48:52.489 --> 01:48:54.491
You too-very good.

01:48:54.783 --> 01:48:56.660
Very good. Now.

01:48:58.412 --> 01:49:02.041
I pull up my shirt
and show my tummy-tum-tum.

01:49:02.332 --> 01:49:06.211
Now you show me
your tummy-tum-tum.

01:49:06.503 --> 01:49:08.422
Lift up your shirt.

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:22.227
Behold, the witch's mark.

01:49:22.519 --> 01:49:24.521
No! No!

01:49:27.232 --> 01:49:30.819
Behold the devil's own child!

01:49:34.698 --> 01:49:38.202
No!

01:49:40.454 --> 01:49:42.331
No!

01:49:42.623 --> 01:49:47.252
The devil's own child!
Get thee behind me, Satan!

01:49:50.464 --> 01:49:52.925
<i>The devil's own child!</i>

01:49:53.217 --> 01:49:55.094
<i>No!</i>

01:49:55.385 --> 01:49:58.013
Give me that child!

01:49:58.305 --> 01:49:59.807
Ham.) her!

01:50:00.099 --> 01:50:03.102
<i>Damn your child!</i>

01:50:03.393 --> 01:50:05.604
Reverend, do something!

01:50:05.896 --> 01:50:07.606
Hibbons is innocent.

01:50:07.898 --> 01:50:10.943
- We cannot let this innocent woman hang.
- Innocent?

01:50:11.235 --> 01:50:13.779
Since you first spoke to me
about that Prynne woman,

01:50:14.071 --> 01:50:17.449
everything we've dreamed and toiled for in
the name of the Lord has been threatened!

01:50:17.741 --> 01:50:20.452
I've heard enough!
Did you listen in there?

01:50:20.744 --> 01:50:23.122
Faction, argument, dissent.

01:50:23.413 --> 01:50:25.707
That is the work of Satan.

01:50:29.086 --> 01:50:31.797
<i>The town was in an uproar,</i>

01:50:32.089 --> 01:50:35.884
<i>and so my father risked
one last meeting with my mother,</i>

01:50:36.176 --> 01:50:39.221
<i>convinced that if they
were going to hang Harriet,</i>

01:50:39.513 --> 01:50:43.058
<i>it would not be long before my mother
and I would be seized...</i>

01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:45.144
<i>and hung in our turn.</i>

01:50:48.021 --> 01:50:51.400
I had to speak out.
I couldn't stop myself.

01:50:53.527 --> 01:50:55.279
Damn your husband, Hester.

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:04.872
You and Pearl must go
into hiding... tonight.

01:51:05.164 --> 01:51:08.667
I cannot. I cannot run.

01:51:08.959 --> 01:51:11.461
What are you saying?

01:51:17.426 --> 01:51:19.303
Forgive me.

01:51:21.805 --> 01:51:25.267
Whatever happens, promise me
you will always look after Pearl.

01:51:25.559 --> 01:51:30.772
Oh, God, woman. How much further
must you take this?

01:51:31.064 --> 01:51:33.358
As far as my strength
will take me.

01:51:36.403 --> 01:51:38.906
If Harriet is to hang,
then I must hang with her.

01:51:43.076 --> 01:51:46.496
I will ask the other women
to stand with us.

01:51:46.788 --> 01:51:48.540
They cannot hang us all.

01:51:52.127 --> 01:51:55.255
Hester, are we never
to know a life together?

01:52:00.135 --> 01:52:03.055
I love thee.

01:52:03.347 --> 01:52:07.059
God help me, I love thee
and I always will.

01:52:07.351 --> 01:52:10.103
I will always love thee.

01:52:18.946 --> 01:52:21.448
Lord God,

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.409
we stood before Thee
naked once...

01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:28.705
and now we stand before Thee
naked again as a family.

01:52:30.123 --> 01:52:34.920
God, Thou hast given me
this as a gift,

01:52:35.212 --> 01:52:38.257
and I will not, not give it up!

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.177
Not while I have the strength!

01:53:16.712 --> 01:53:18.588
<i>Arthur?</i>

01:53:37.858 --> 01:53:39.735
<i>Arthur?</i>

01:54:03.383 --> 01:54:05.218
Arthur?

01:54:30.243 --> 01:54:32.913
Evening, Mistress P-Prynne.

01:54:33.205 --> 01:54:36.124
- Expecting someone else?
- No, uh-

01:54:36.416 --> 01:54:41.046
Did you not call out for Arthur?
The only Arthur I know is Dimmesdale.

01:54:41.338 --> 01:54:45.384
You misunderstood me.
I said, are there... persons there?

01:54:45.675 --> 01:54:48.553
I should've guessed long ago.

01:54:48.845 --> 01:54:51.890
You naughty girl.

01:54:52.182 --> 01:54:55.602
So you fucked a minister, huh?

01:54:55.894 --> 01:55:01.108
Oh, God, how my father
will savor that priceless morsel!

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:03.944
Oops-a-daisy.

01:55:04.236 --> 01:55:06.279
What'd he do to you, huh?

01:55:06.571 --> 01:55:09.116
Did he suck your breasts?

01:55:09.408 --> 01:55:11.243
Did he lick you?

01:55:11.535 --> 01:55:14.287
Where did he lick you, Hester?

01:55:14.579 --> 01:55:16.373
Show me!

01:55:17.499 --> 01:55:19.960
God, how I've wanted
to poke you!

01:55:26.716 --> 01:55:30.679
All the nights
you came into my dreams...

01:55:30.971 --> 01:55:33.265
to bewitch me,
and all the while...

01:55:33.557 --> 01:55:36.059
giving it to another...

01:55:50.574 --> 01:55:53.910
- Damn you, witch!
- Get out!

01:55:56.329 --> 01:55:58.206
Do up your britches and get out.

01:56:06.673 --> 01:56:09.801
You bastard, get out!

01:56:10.093 --> 01:56:13.305
I shall enjoy watching you
and your minister hang!

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.821
Open up, Doctor!

01:56:30.113 --> 01:56:34.701
There are matters between us
that we must discuss immediately!

01:57:01.728 --> 01:57:05.357
So, Arthur Dimmesdale.

01:57:07.734 --> 01:57:12.531
Thy will be blindly done.
Thy will be blindly done.

01:58:47.042 --> 01:58:50.503
<i>He's been murdered!</i>

01:58:50.795 --> 01:58:53.632
<i>Call out the militia.
Call out the guards.</i>

01:58:53.923 --> 01:58:57.844
<i>It's a sign! The Lord
has sent us a sign!</i>

01:58:58.136 --> 01:59:02.641
- <i>Get the Praying Indians! Lock 'em up!</i>
<i>- We have strayed!</i>

01:59:03.975 --> 01:59:06.811
<i>See how He punishes us!</i>

01:59:07.103 --> 01:59:11.107
<i>It's Brewster!
The savages have killed him!</i>

01:59:11.399 --> 01:59:13.109
<i>My son! My son!</i>

01:59:13.401 --> 01:59:16.196
<i>They've cut him into pieces,
the heathen bastards!</i>

01:59:16.488 --> 01:59:18.990
<i>Lock up the Praying Indians...</i>

01:59:19.282 --> 01:59:22.118
<i>before they murder us in our beds!</i>

01:59:22.410 --> 01:59:24.329
<i>Get the Praying Indians!</i>

01:59:24.621 --> 01:59:26.665
<i>- No!</i>
- <i>Get into your compound, you savages!</i>

01:59:26.956 --> 01:59:29.626
<i>Praying Indians
into the compound! Get in with ya!</i>

01:59:29.918 --> 01:59:33.088
Come on!

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.216
<i>We are loyal to you!</i>

01:59:39.427 --> 01:59:44.015
<i>Protect the children
before it's too late!</i>

01:59:44.307 --> 01:59:49.437
Mistress Prynne, by order of the
Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony,

01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:54.150
you are hereby placed under arrest
for the acts of heresy...

01:59:57.404 --> 02:00:00.699
Stop this! It was
one of us killed Brewster!

02:00:03.451 --> 02:00:05.578
It was one of us! I have proof I.

02:00:08.665 --> 02:00:10.875
Bastards!

02:00:11.167 --> 02:00:15.547
Johnny, run! Metacomet's braves
by the river. I've seen them.

02:00:15.839 --> 02:00:19.676
Tell Metacomet to come
and save his people! Run, man!

02:00:23.138 --> 02:00:26.057
<i>Here come the witches.</i>

02:00:26.349 --> 02:00:28.059
Stand guard'
Don't look in their eyes!

02:00:28.351 --> 02:00:30.645
<i>Open the cells!</i>

02:00:41.865 --> 02:00:43.658
- Never mind the child.
- Pearl!

02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:46.077
- Get in! Get in, woman!
- Pearl!

02:00:46.369 --> 02:00:51.583
Worry not, Mistress Prynne. I'll
see she's raised up to fear the Lord.

02:00:59.674 --> 02:01:03.762
Let it be for the highest court.

02:01:04.053 --> 02:01:05.847
We humbly submit to Thy will.

02:01:10.477 --> 02:01:12.645
Open up, murderer!

02:01:29.204 --> 02:01:33.291
<i>It is God's will
that they should hang!</i>

02:01:33.583 --> 02:01:35.668
People of New England!

02:01:42.467 --> 02:01:44.719
There is no witchcraft here!

02:01:47.639 --> 02:01:49.974
If we hang these women,

02:01:50.266 --> 02:01:52.060
then what have we become?

02:01:52.352 --> 02:01:55.939
Who are we to condemn...

02:01:56.231 --> 02:01:57.982
on God's behalf?

02:02:06.908 --> 02:02:09.536
I love...

02:02:09.828 --> 02:02:11.621
this woman!

02:02:13.623 --> 02:02:17.460
I am... the father of her child!

02:02:17.752 --> 02:02:20.588
And in God's eyes,

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:23.049
I am her husband.

02:02:29.931 --> 02:02:32.183
Now, if you must...

02:02:32.475 --> 02:02:34.185
hang someone...

02:02:34.477 --> 02:02:38.857
to appease your... your anger...

02:02:39.148 --> 02:02:41.442
and your fear,

02:02:43.319 --> 02:02:45.196
then hang me!

02:03:26.404 --> 02:03:28.781
<i>Hang him!</i>

02:03:29.073 --> 02:03:30.783
<i>Hang him! Hang him!</i>

02:03:31.242 --> 02:03:35.079
<i>Hang him! Hang him! Hang him!</i>

02:03:45.673 --> 02:03:47.759
Hang him! Hang him!

02:03:48.051 --> 02:03:59.938
Hang him! Hang him! Hang him!

02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:05.068
Hang him! Hang him!
Hang him! Hang him!

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:16.162
Hang him! Hang him! Hang him!

02:04:30.677 --> 02:04:33.471
<i>Bastards!</i>

02:04:38.726 --> 02:04:41.270
- Where's Pearl?
- She's in the armory.

02:05:03.126 --> 02:05:05.003
Here.

02:05:14.929 --> 02:05:16.806
Hester!

02:05:21.227 --> 02:05:23.146
Where's my child?

02:05:23.438 --> 02:05:25.982
- She's in the meeting house.
- Come on!

02:05:55.595 --> 02:05:57.764
You are free, my people!

02:05:58.056 --> 02:06:01.350
Go back to Metacomet!
Go back to the forest!

02:07:16.509 --> 02:07:20.638
Bellingham will do anything
to conceal this madness from England.

02:07:22.223 --> 02:07:26.102
He has sworn to me
that he will remove the letter...

02:07:26.394 --> 02:07:28.646
and make thee a public apology.

02:07:31.607 --> 02:07:34.527
How close they are, love and hate.

02:07:34.819 --> 02:07:38.281
We are no less bound
by one than the other.

02:07:43.369 --> 02:07:45.955
Rest in peace, Roger Prynne.

02:07:55.548 --> 02:07:57.633
This letter has served a purpose,

02:07:58.801 --> 02:08:02.180
though not the one
they had intended.

02:08:02.471 --> 02:08:05.016
So why would I stay here?

02:08:05.308 --> 02:08:08.644
To be accepted by them?
To be tamed by them?

02:08:16.444 --> 02:08:19.822
- There's no perfect world, Hester.
- No, not perfect.

02:08:22.074 --> 02:08:24.452
But we came here to make a new one.

02:08:27.455 --> 02:08:29.332
And for Pearl's sake,

02:08:31.792 --> 02:08:33.920
I must do just that.

02:08:37.924 --> 02:08:39.884
Hester.

02:08:40.176 --> 02:08:41.928
Come along.

02:08:43.429 --> 02:08:45.264
Hester!

02:08:46.557 --> 02:08:48.392
Look at me.

02:08:50.102 --> 02:08:52.396
If I look at you,
I won't be able to leave.

02:08:52.688 --> 02:08:54.899
Then leave.

02:08:55.191 --> 02:08:56.984
Brave the wilds.

02:09:04.075 --> 02:09:07.411
But, Hester, I'll not let you,

02:09:07.703 --> 02:09:10.039
in God's name, go without me.

02:09:22.218 --> 02:09:24.095
They're watching us.

02:09:48.494 --> 02:09:51.163
<i>In the faraway Carolinas,</i>

02:09:51.455 --> 02:09:54.333
<i>my parents were, at last, to find
a measure of the happiness...</i>

02:09:54.625 --> 02:09:57.920
<i>that had been denied them
for so long.</i>

02:09:58.212 --> 02:10:01.632
<i>My father died
before I reached my teens.</i>

02:10:01.924 --> 02:10:05.344
<i>Some say that was a punishment.</i>

02:10:05.636 --> 02:10:09.432
<i>My mother never remarried
nor loved another.</i>

02:10:09.724 --> 02:10:12.893
<i>Some say that was a punishment.</i>

02:10:13.185 --> 02:10:15.396
<i>As for me,</i>

02:10:15.688 --> 02:10:17.857
<i>I do not see it that way.</i>

02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:21.319
<i>My parents shared
a love like no other.</i>

02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:25.072
<i>I know the spirit of that love
lives within me...</i>

02:10:25.364 --> 02:10:27.658
<i>and will live
within my children forever.</i>

02:10:30.536 --> 02:10:34.832
<i>Who is to say what is a sin
in God's eyes?</i>
