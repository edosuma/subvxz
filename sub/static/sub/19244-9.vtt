WEBVTT

00:26.401 --> 00:29.904
-Honey, it happened. I heard from him.
-Heard from who?

00:29.988 --> 00:32.115
That guy Anton
with the medieval Serbian book

00:32.198 --> 00:34.117
that might have a cure for-- Whoa.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.037
Your eye is a little wonky there.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.415
Ever since I shoved it back in,
it occasionally drifts.

00:40.498 --> 00:41.875
Would you mind fixing it for me?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.460
Oh, uh...

00:43.543 --> 00:45.837
Come on. I have a really hard time
lining it up straight, okay?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.507
Please? I'll make it up to you.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.884
[sighs] Sure.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.720
Although I can't quite tell if you're
flirting with me or my flip-flops.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.013
[chuckles]

00:55.096 --> 00:57.515
-So, what did Anton say?
-It was a text.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.518
Said he'd meet with me, but only
in public and only if I stop calling him.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.562
-This feels weird.
-Don't think about it.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.355
-How many times did you call?
-[sighs]

01:04.439 --> 01:06.357
I'm not telling.
You might take my phone away.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.569
He's gonna be at a paranormal conference
today in Oxnard.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.738
He meets you,
you put on your little horror show,

01:11.821 --> 01:13.656
eat a finger,
let him stab you in the stomach,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.701
-and he'll have to let us see that book.
-Okay. Happy about that.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.536
Less happy about being called
a horror show.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
Ooh, wait, right there. Yeah, yeah.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.083
-Okay, now press it until you hear a pop.
-No.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.876
Come on.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.420
Go on.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.507
-[eyeball pops]
-[sighs and moans]

01:30.715 --> 01:31.549
Now we're grooving.

01:32.801 --> 01:33.843
Yay.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.137
Eric's been to a bunch
of these conventions

01:36.221 --> 01:39.015
and said he'd come in case we need help
translating nerd to English.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.434
-[chuckles]
-[Sheila] Hmm. ParanormalCon.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.354
You know, it's too bad
that Anton isn't a hamster

01:44.437 --> 01:47.607
because then we could communicate with him
through Vicky the Pet Psychic.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.111
I know a lot of this seems improbable,
but I also never thought

01:51.194 --> 01:54.155
one day I might be making a Snapple cap
sound with my wife's eyeball.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.407
-Hey, everyone. Don't freak out.
-[door shuts]

01:56.491 --> 01:57.826
Why would we--

01:57.909 --> 01:59.619
Because a cop's
bringing your daughter home.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.830
I got a call from a colleague
who pulled Abby over

02:01.913 --> 02:06.042
for running a stop sign, on a motorcycle
without plates or a VIN number,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.461
in a jacket that says "Pussy Magnet."

02:08.545 --> 02:12.549
-What?
-My God, that's a lot for me to process.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.718
The smartest thing she did
was drop my name to the officer.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.304
Thank you, Rick, for bringing her home.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.931
If you really want to thank me,

02:20.014 --> 02:23.351
you'll invite me over
when you cook up this beautiful meat.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.770
-You doing Korean barbecue?
-Not Korean.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.232
Whatever. It's calling my name. [chuckles]

02:31.067 --> 02:32.735
[dispatch on radio, indistinct]

02:32.819 --> 02:35.572
-Could have, a week ago.
-You were riding a motorcycle?

02:35.655 --> 02:39.534
Are you crazy?
I mean, where did you even get it?

02:39.617 --> 02:40.451
[door closes]

02:40.535 --> 02:43.496
I decided to fix up Dad's bike,
so I took it to this chop shop.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.291
The guy there completely ripped me off,
and then he OD'd and died.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.044
So I took his bike and I would continue
but Dad's already blinking a lot.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.464
Abby, there are about six points
in that story

02:53.548 --> 02:56.342
-where you could've gotten killed.
-Seven, if you include this one.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.888
[Sheila] You could've gotten arrested.
This could go on your permanent record.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.431
-You might not get into college.
-[sighs]

03:02.932 --> 03:04.726
-I might not want to go to college.
-[scoffs]

03:04.809 --> 03:06.769
-What?
-Who cares what <i>you </i>want?

03:06.853 --> 03:11.316
What your daddy is trying to say
is that we don't care what you want.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.654
-Obviously, we're upset.
-We're upset.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.407
I forgive you.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.036
I'll be upstairs being grounded.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.415
Good, 'cause you're grounded!

03:27.498 --> 03:28.958
God, that felt hollow.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.757
She stole a motorcycle
and doesn't want to go to college.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.550
We're losing control.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.845
I'm gonna skip the convention today
and spend some time with her.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.058
Honey, this guy, Anton,
has the book that might have a cure.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.727
This might be the only chance
we get to talk to him.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.523
Lately, there's always something
more important than Abby.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.736
We have to go buy a meat freezer.
I have to eat the dead guy in the tub.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.030
I gotta go find the femur
I lost in the driveway.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.323
I know we've been distracted,

04:00.406 --> 04:02.700
apparently enough for you to lose
a human bone in the front yard.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.787
-It had rolled under the car. I found it.
-Fantastic.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.998
My point is there'll be plenty of time
for Abby after you're better.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.083
Honey...

04:10.583 --> 04:13.795
I know that you want to believe
there's a cure, but what if there's not?

04:13.878 --> 04:15.755
Don't talk like that. There has to be.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.344
-We have to try, even if it's a long shot.
-It is a long shot.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.847
But it's a sure thing
that my daughter needs me.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.769
And I need to know that if I'm not
gonna be here, she's gonna be okay.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.317
Fine. I'll just go with Eric.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.154
How hard can it be to get
a nervous paranoid recluse

04:40.238 --> 04:41.864
to show me his most prized possession?

04:42.490 --> 04:43.992
I have faith in you.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.537
I also believe that you won't be
the only guy at a paranormal convention

04:47.620 --> 04:49.580
without a woman on his arm.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.960
[clicks tongue]

04:57.588 --> 05:00.008
[Lisa] Thank you for taking Eric
to the freak convention.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.428
He's so excited
he took two showers. He sweats.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.889
Please, leave us something to talk about.
So, how are you doing?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.474
I'm good.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.936
Dan's partner, Anne,
has been keeping me distracted.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.188
She comes, like, all the time.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.567
That must be... nice.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.861
Really nice.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.657
-[knocks on door]
-Eric, you have a gentleman caller.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.909
Mom, you don't have
to sexualize everything.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.871
-He's not wrong.
-Oh, you two.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.415
Hey, you told me you would clean up
your room before you left.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.834
-I'll do it when I get home.
-Promise is a promise, mister.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.085
-Do it now.
-Okay.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.546
Have fun today. I love you.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.548
[kisses, sniffs] Ohh!

05:40.631 --> 05:43.176
Goddamn, you still have
that new baby smell.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.636
Ohh...

05:49.390 --> 05:51.559
-I didn't hear any of that.
-Excellent.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.479
Hey, thanks again
for taking me to the convention.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.105
Dan never went to these with me.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.524
He said it should be called
a para-not-normal convention.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.818
I told him that's what paranormal
already meant,

06:00.902 --> 06:04.197
then he accidentally spilled beer
on my Xbox.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.658
-So, any news about finding your stepdad?
-You mean since you killed him?

06:09.243 --> 06:11.079
Oh, that's a thing that you know.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.538
Abby told me.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.460
I'm really sorry, Eric.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.797
He kept pushing me and pushing me,
and I just snapped.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.590
Hey, it could happen to...

06:24.384 --> 06:27.303
Well, "anybody" is probably
too broad of a category

06:27.386 --> 06:29.430
when talking about murdering someone
with a shovel.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.640
I am not a murderer.

06:32.475 --> 06:36.187
Okay, technically, I am.
Not even technically. Literally.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.857
But I refuse to be defined
by the one time I murdered somebody.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.444
But enough about me.
How are you holding up?

06:43.528 --> 06:44.654
I've stopped sleeping.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.907
Every time I close my eyes,
I see Dan calling to me.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.744
Oh, Jesus, Eric. I am so sorry.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.954
[sighs]

06:53.037 --> 06:54.705
No, I'm just messing with you.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.500
Dan was an awful man
and I'm glad he's gone.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.419
Do you know how to fold a hoodie?

07:01.546 --> 07:02.588
Yeah.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.217
The secret is to not give a shit,
'cause I have to save my wife. Let's go.

07:06.717 --> 07:10.304
-And I hang mine in the closet.
-You hang it, okay.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.683
After we return the motorcycle,

07:13.766 --> 07:17.061
I thought we could go have tea
at that cute little tea shop?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.397
Like when you were little?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.899
Remember, that place with the scones?

07:22.859 --> 07:27.822
If you don't answer, will I end
every sentence in a question? Yes?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.700
I don't see
why we have to return the bike.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.034
The guy's dead. He doesn't care.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.704
Well, I'm dead and I care.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.414
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.583
-You need to learn that's wrong.
-[machine whirring]

07:38.666 --> 07:41.419
Oh, excuse me, sir? Do you work here?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.754
Hey, that's my brother's bike.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.549
Oh, you're the deceased's brother.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.260
I'm so sorry. He was a great man.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.762
What the fuck are you doing with his bike?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
My daughter borrowed it
and wants to return it.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.892
Borrowed it or stoled it?

07:56.392 --> 07:58.436
Uh, well, since she's bringing it back,
definitely borrowed.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.770
And "stoled" is not a word.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.399
What? How is he gonna learn?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.109
-College.
-Smooth.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.278
While I enjoy mother/daughter stuff
on the Internet,

08:07.361 --> 08:08.821
this isn't working for me.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.282
So why don't you get out of here
before I press charges.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.159
I'm the one who should be
pressing charges.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.912
Your brother took my money
and didn't fix my bike.

08:15.995 --> 08:20.875
My brother was a stupid fucking idiot,
so if he ripped you off,

08:20.958 --> 08:23.544
-that makes you a stupider fucking idiot.
-All right.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.547
I was just trying to teach my daughter
a lesson about doing the right thing

08:26.631 --> 08:30.092
but having experienced you, I think
you should give her the money back.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.137
Now.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.933
Fine. Fuck it. I'll get it for you.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.560
Wait here.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.897
-[door slams shut]
-See?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.815
Now we're learning another lesson.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.276
If you treat people firmly
but with respect...

08:47.360 --> 08:49.195
[handsaw buzzing]

08:49.278 --> 08:51.781
[raising voice] ...you're more likely
to get what you want.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.910
-He's not coming out.
-It would appear not.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.496
Now what lesson are we learning?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.623
-[buzzing stops]
-To let it go.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.250
We're gonna go have our tea

09:02.333 --> 09:04.544
and we're not gonna let our day
be ruined by some pervert

09:04.627 --> 09:06.963
who can't even look us in the eye
when he's cheating us.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.422
What kind of tea are you gonna get?

09:09.006 --> 09:12.385
Probably like a nice steaming cup of...
fuck you, motherfucker!

09:12.468 --> 09:16.472
You donkey fucker,
give us our fucking money back!

09:22.311 --> 09:25.356
I think we're gonna do different
mother/daughter stuff today.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.150
Awesome.
Can we not call it mother/daughter stuff?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.570
-I know. He totally ruined that.
-Yeah.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.823
[low chatter]

09:44.542 --> 09:46.877
-Hey.
-Where is this guy?

09:46.961 --> 09:49.505
He'll be here.
Check it out. I got a churro saber.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.342
This place feels a little less
than scientific.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.886
[muffled] Don't lose your faith.
Anton is the real deal.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.139
He's got files proving
the government's been suppressing

09:58.222 --> 09:59.932
the existence of the undead.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.642
-Bite?
-Pass.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.562
Yeah, it's not very good.
Once you get food over three feet long,

10:04.645 --> 10:07.106
it's more about structural integrity
than flavor.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.901
-Excuse me. I'm trying to find someone.
-Someone?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
Yeah. His name's Anton.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.072
-Anton?
-Hey, Bordan.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.575
-Eric.
-Oh, you two know each other?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.827
Hi, I'm Joel, Eric's friend.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.497
I'm thirsty.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.709
What the hell was that?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.420
These people aren't like you.
You can't come on that strong.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.796
"I'm Joel" is too strong?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.507
Yes, with those piercing eyes
and perfect posture,

10:33.591 --> 10:36.469
you're like that hundred foot tall
Christ statue overlooking Rio.

10:36.552 --> 10:41.140
You need to be more like... well, Bordan.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.770
I'm not sure I can do that,
because I can operate a juice box.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.732
Well, you're gonna have to try
'cause Anton just came in.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.110
Oh, my God, that's him?

10:55.780 --> 10:58.574
-Come on, I need answers.
-Whoa, Jack Bauer, dial it down.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.034
Less... [in gruff voice]

Maybe I just want to live a little freer.

You know, like you do now,
less about planning and the future

11:46.997 --> 11:48.791
and more about living in the moment.

I should drop out of school and be a poet.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.973
I shouldn't have talked
about Sheila online,

22:30.057 --> 22:34.061
and you were right, I was trying
to impress all these people.

22:35.062 --> 22:38.648
You've been cool your whole life
but I've always been...

22:39.691 --> 22:41.526
well, invisible.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.572
So, I was wrong and it won't happen again.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.036
I'm sorry, I was thinking about
how handsome I am. What?

22:51.912 --> 22:54.956
-Seriously?
-Of course not. What do you think I am?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.250
I heard you.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.839
But did you really think
you could get away

23:02.923 --> 23:05.467
-with stealing government documents?
-What?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.594
I'm taking you in, Eric Bemis!

23:07.677 --> 23:09.054
[attendees murmuring]

23:09.638 --> 23:11.389
Oh, my God, you're making me
so impressive right now.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.808
Shut up!

23:12.891 --> 23:16.436
You're under arrest for knowing more
than any one man has the right to.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.188
I won't shut up!

23:18.271 --> 23:20.941
You can put my body back
in hibernation fluid

23:21.441 --> 23:23.902
but my mind will always roam free!

23:23.985 --> 23:26.404
-Too big?
-I certainly wouldn't go any bigger.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.576
[voices on TV, indistinct]

23:35.330 --> 23:37.624
-[Joel] Sheila?
-[softly] I'm in here.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.044
[TV clicks off]

23:42.087 --> 23:44.506
-How'd it go with Anton?
-Total fraud.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.051
I almost hit him,
and I'm not sure I would've stopped.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.803
[sighs] Oh, no.

23:49.886 --> 23:53.181
I keep telling myself
I'm not that guy, but maybe I am.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.308
Maybe we're both different people now.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.936
So we'll be different together.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.650
I got a card for a doctor up north.

24:03.733 --> 24:07.320
-I know it's another long shot, but--
-Whatever it is, I'm in.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.156
You are?

24:09.739 --> 24:12.868
Abby's gonna grow up
to be an amazing woman,

24:12.951 --> 24:16.580
and I want to be around
to see as much of that as I can.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.584
So if there's a chance for a cure,
no matter how much of a long shot,

24:20.667 --> 24:22.335
I wanna take it.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.172
[sighs]

24:25.255 --> 24:26.923
Thank God.

24:27.007 --> 24:30.343
On the way home, I came up with this
whole speech to try to talk you into it.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.768
Yeah, it ended like that.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.124
Hmm.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.086
[telephone ringing]

25:07.589 --> 25:08.673
Hello?

25:09.216 --> 25:12.636
Oh, Mr. Hammond.
I've been expecting your call.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.180
I see.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.057
And how long has she been like this?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.267
[squeaking]

25:20.477 --> 25:21.561
Really?

25:23.188 --> 25:24.689
Fascinating.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.947
[instrumental theme music playing]
