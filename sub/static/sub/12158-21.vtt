Oh, that's the new security
system chuck larabee installed.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.112
Just punch 6-2-2-6-2.

It's easy to remember,
it spells "obama."

00:15.116 --> 00:16.782
That's real funny,

how was your sleepover?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.063
Awesome.
Grandpa's right.

The house
gets so peaceful

Once all the hens
go to sleep.

What time
did he go to bed?

Earlier than usual.
They moved kimmel to 11:30.

We watched tv
and organized our meat.

Wow, he watches tv
the same way you do.

our first barbecue.

Burgers, chicken, lamb,
and brisket.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.519
Mmm. Sounds like
the delicious remains

00:53.521 --> 00:56.021
Of a drone strike
on noah's ark.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.190
Uh, what about tofu,

Yep.
It's on the calendar.

and put "first barbecue."

Well, that doesn't
make it go away.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.907
I've been talking
to her for a week.

She is really excited
about this visit.
Yeah.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.544
Does she have to come
in the house?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.945
We could just leave
a bag of cash

Out on the front porch.
Oh, honey.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.048
You know, maybe
she's not coming for money.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.349
Maybe she misses me.

If I offered her
400 bucks to visit

01:26.420 --> 01:29.121

you know what she'd take.

Uh, I'll leave right now
for $200.

have all the answers.

some of the answers.

and you just copied off of me.

In every young man's life,
there is a mandy baxter.

You know what? I feel
really lucky to have brad.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.893
I'm just hoping
that having this baby

Will get him
to settle down.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.729
Yeah, yeah.

when I got pregnant,

for three years.

have no secrets.

Ah, well, considering
your year as a carny,

always been willing to help you,

underwriting it.

she gonna start a family, mom?

on this offer.

how happy she was.

away from her.

and manipulative,

11:55.382 --> 11:58.249
And...Those are not good
qualities for mandy to admire,

11:58.251 --> 12:00.552

good qualities for a mom.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.807
I don't know.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.108
It's because...

19:04.110 --> 19:06.244
One of the window sensors
is out.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.612
I got to go look at that.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.613
Hey.
Hi.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.647
Everything okay?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.648
Yes.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.150
Um...

19:12.152 --> 19:14.785
I told aunt April that
I couldn't give her an egg.
Ah.

19:14.787 --> 19:15.920
My choice.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.456
Okay. Good.
I think it's the right choice.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.124
Right.
I'm proud of you.
Yeah.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.759
You're no jimmy carter.

19:23.929 --> 19:24.929
I'm gonna go to bed.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.531
Got some rompers
to sew tomorrow.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.532
Mwah!
Oh, good.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.635
Night, dad.
Happy birthday.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.270
I'm proud of you.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.971
Have a good night.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.974
She has turned into a really
ambitious young woman.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.776
Somebody did
a good job parenting.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.111
You're welcome.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.379
Listen...

19:41.381 --> 19:43.147
I got to fix this window

19:43.149 --> 19:45.116
And then I'll be up
for my birthday present.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.618
So, uh, brace yourself.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.663
Okay,
hold it right there.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.897
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.465
Hey.
It's just a false alarm.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.368
One of my screen sensors
looks like it came loose.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.637
I'm gonna need to see
some I.D.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.439
I don't have any I.D.
I live here.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.142
This house.
Look at my desk.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.677
You'll see a picture of me
sitting right on that desk.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.711
Look at that.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.080
So you've been
looking in the windows?

20:16.082 --> 20:17.748
What's going on, hal?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.051
Responding to an alarm,
mr. Larabee.
Uh-huh.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.920
Found this one
by the front window.

20:23.922 --> 20:27.358
Yeah, he does fit the profile
of a peeping tom --

20:27.360 --> 20:32.430
Middle-aged,
sweatpants, peeping.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.831
He says
he's the resident.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.602
Mm. Straight out of
the peeping-tom handbook.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.004
This is real funny,
larabee.
[ chuckles ]

20:40.006 --> 20:41.872
You know, I could
put this on yelp.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.408
[ chuckles ] I'll vouch for him,
hal. Go ahead, guys.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.777
Okay.
Take it easy, boss.
See?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.412
Hey, doesn't feel so good,
does it?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.214
You know --
when people jump
to conclusions about you?

20:50.216 --> 20:51.582
You know
what doesn't feel good

20:51.584 --> 20:54.418
Is hiring an incompetent
security company.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.420
You know, that window sensor's
loose or something.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.922
Keeps showing up
on this alarm pad.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.790
Oh, you probably
changed the pass code

20:59.792 --> 21:01.425
Without resetting
the system.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.994
Did you switch out obama?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.896
It was a change
I could believe in.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.732
Yeah. [ chuckles ]

21:07.734 --> 21:09.867
Oh, yeah, it's been
a tough five years.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.070
Bin laden's dead
and the stock market's doubled.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.905
Hang in there.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.475
Yeah. No doubt,
things have gotten better.
Mm.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.645
Bush's policies
have finally kicked in.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.280
[ laughs ]

21:22.282 --> 21:24.282
Good night, baxter.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.951
Night, larabee.
