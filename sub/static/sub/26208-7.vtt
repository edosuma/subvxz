00:01.101 --> 00:02.135
My name is Lena Grisky

00:02.168 --> 00:05.238
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.472
I have a secret.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.441
I'm a time traveler from
1905

00:08.474 --> 00:11.144
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Lena) Previously...

00:46.913 --> 00:49.683
(Lena) You just want me to
fail...
-No, I don't.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.751
Thea wants me to fail.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.185
You'll never keep up.
I'm already ahead of you.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.121
But I won't let her get to me.

00:55.856 --> 00:59.125
Henri's father Victor
won't help him.
-Stay out of trouble.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.794
And the Time Collectors
are still after him.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.395
I'm going to erase you.

01:02.428 --> 01:04.164
Luckily, he's managed
to escape them.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.200
Let's get him!
-For now...

01:15.876 --> 01:21.648
(Jeff) Oh, man! You're the star
of the scene study. As usual...
-Thanks.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.652
I can totally see you
as the "handsome farmer".
Oh, me, you ask?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.555
Oh well, see, I've locked
down the role of a tree, so...

01:28.855 --> 01:33.259
Actually, I should really
cross that out and write
"handsome"...

01:33.293 --> 01:38.431
(Kennedy)
Uh-oh. Thea is the wife!
She's not going to be happy.

01:38.464 --> 01:39.700
Who?

01:39.733 --> 01:41.201
Kennedy.
-Bree.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.436
I'm the Downtrodden Wife?

01:46.239 --> 01:46.873
Seriously?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.209
(whispers)
Are we supposed to answer?

01:49.242 --> 01:52.913
Who's the Etherial Sprite, then?
Lena?! You have got to be
kidding me!

01:52.946 --> 01:56.216
The Downtrodden Wife is
a way better part.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.518
Just don't even.

01:57.551 --> 02:02.689
It is. It's such
a stretch for you.
The Etherial Sprite is...

02:02.723 --> 02:04.691
...what you radiate
on a daily basis.

02:10.496 --> 02:12.766
(squeals) I'm the Sprite!

02:13.366 --> 02:15.536
I'm the best dancer.
I should be the Sprite.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.738
They're both great parts.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.508
Think about it.
We could be trees...

02:21.542 --> 02:23.343
(Dash) Hm?
-No offence.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.411
Is she being serious?
Are you being serious?

02:25.445 --> 02:30.283
As if I'd ever get stuck on
the back row as a tree. Please.
(snaps her fingers)

02:30.951 --> 02:31.818
Congratulations.

02:33.253 --> 02:37.891
Question of the day.
How does a tree actually dance?
Like this...?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.627
(all laugh)

02:50.771 --> 02:55.375
It's a sunny day in grand
Paris, and you know
who likes the sun?

02:56.376 --> 02:58.745
Our handsome farmer, Max here.

03:01.381 --> 03:08.855
(sighs) Thea Raphael,
you've landed the coveted role
of the Downtrodden Wife.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.825
Please, tell us how you prepare
for such a role.
-Get lost, Jeffrey.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.629
(Dash laughs)
-(Jeff) Oh, oh look.
It's Sir Birch.

03:16.296 --> 03:19.265
Hm....
-I should have been
the Handsome Farmer.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.768
You know it, I know it,
even Max knows it.

03:22.302 --> 03:26.907
(scoffs) You're cute,
Dash, but
you're no "Handsome Farmer".

03:26.940 --> 03:30.443
(Dash)
Yeah? But I'm the better dancer.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.846
(chuckles) Jury's still out
on that one, bro.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.885
(Jeff) Ines, how do you think
the Downtrodden Wife
is going to react

03:38.919 --> 03:41.588
when the Etherial Sprite
steals him away?

03:41.622 --> 03:45.391
Well, it's not going
to be good, Jeff.
That's all I've got to say.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.994
(Etienne clears his
throat)

03:50.897 --> 03:54.034
Gather round, everyone,
for some exciting news.

03:54.067 --> 03:58.972
As you read from the cast list
outside, today we will be doing
a scene study

03:59.005 --> 04:03.577
on one of the most
romantic ballets
in the history of ballet.

04:03.610 --> 04:07.614
The one and only... "La Fée"
also known as "The Fairy".

04:07.648 --> 04:09.415
Oh, I love "La Fée"!

04:09.449 --> 04:11.051
You know "La Fée"?!

04:11.084 --> 04:14.555
Oh, it's one of my favorites.
It's the story of a
simple farmer, named Hubert,

04:15.321 --> 04:19.926
and his plain but loving wife,
Griselle, and the Fairy
who ruins them.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.962
(Jeff chuckles)
-(Dash) Shhh!

04:21.995 --> 04:24.631
(Etienne)
What a surprise.
Mr Chase has an opinion.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.366
(students chuckle)

04:26.399 --> 04:30.737
(Jeff) Oh, well... A Fairy?
How much damage
could she possibly do?

04:31.371 --> 04:35.676
Oh, a lot!
The fairy and Hubert
fall madly in love

04:36.076 --> 04:41.314
and conspire to run away
to the only place they can be
together... Fairyland.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.851
(Jeff bursts out in laughter)
Fairyland? Seriously?

04:44.885 --> 04:48.955
Bite your tongue, young man.
Fairyland is the only place
they can be together.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.924
(Jeff) OK...

04:51.457 --> 04:52.826
(Etienne) Enough
chit-chat.

04:54.427 --> 04:59.533
Lena, let's see your sprite
steal Max's farmer away
from Thea's hag of a wife.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.907
(Lena) I was so distracted
by Thea this morning, I didn't
realize that Max is the farmer.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.542
So?

05:08.575 --> 05:14.114
It's just... there's this legend
about "La Fée".

05:14.147 --> 05:17.884
Those that dance the roles,
they always fall for each other.

05:17.918 --> 05:22.388
(scoffs) As if, Lena!
(chuckles)

05:32.633 --> 05:36.336
(horse hooves clattering)

05:50.050 --> 05:55.789
(Oscar) No, no! I've already
told you I don't want you in
here. You're too much trouble.

05:55.822 --> 05:59.560
But we're friends. And friends
wouldn't kick friends out when
they have nowhere else to go.

05:59.593 --> 06:03.129
So you're in a bit of a pickle
then, aren't you?
-A little bit.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.499
My Dad said he wants
to send me to my uncle's farm
in the middle of nowhere

06:06.867 --> 06:11.404
but if that happens
then I'll never get to Lena,
who's trapped in a time bubble.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.576
You have to help me. I
love her.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.914
Love will make you do
the craziest things.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.418
This is amazing.
There's stuff in here
that isn't even in your book.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.453
You only skimmed my book.

06:27.487 --> 06:33.560
But look, maybe
if I put it here or...
Even here...

06:33.594 --> 06:36.663
That looks like something,
right? Maybe a clue, or a code?

06:36.697 --> 06:39.833
OK. You win. Let me have
it.

06:41.034 --> 06:47.440
Whoa... I keep a small room
for travelers in transit.
Keep it clean.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.676
You won't regret this.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.921
(classical piano music plays)

07:21.274 --> 07:23.644
(Etienne)
Good. That's it, Thea.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.946
(Thea) (sarcastic)
Great. I'm a natural hag.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.482
(Jeff whispers) I've never been
so inspired by a human tree.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.451
(whispers)
He's getting so into it!

07:48.168 --> 07:50.203
Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

07:50.737 --> 07:54.207
Should we go from the top?
-Yes.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.897
(whispers) Look at me.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.969
(Etienne) Extend, Lena.
Max, give her more support.
Don't lose the technique.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.706
Wooooh!

08:30.944 --> 08:34.080
(Jeff) This is feeling tense.
Are you tense? I feel tense.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.317
I'm gonna give my tree
a manly name.
Redwood? Maple?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.252
How about a palm tree?

08:54.635 --> 08:59.706
(Etienne) Now, Max, this is the
moment you fall head over heels
in love with this etherial
creature.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.075
I think he just did!
(Ines giggles)

09:02.108 --> 09:03.744
(Etienne) Once again, please.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.912
(Lena sighs)

09:18.959 --> 09:22.195
(Etienne)
Lena. You're killing me.
I thought you respected Le Fée.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.298
I'm sorry, I do...
-(Etienne)
No excuses. Take five.

09:25.331 --> 09:28.101
Come back and make sure
you get yourself sorted.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.171
What are you doing?
Are you OK?

09:31.204 --> 09:34.007
Five. Minute. Break.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.312
(Jeff) Whoa. We've got
a runaway fairy.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.081
(Dash) And a tree!

09:47.854 --> 09:50.657
I made such a fool of
myself.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.292
It wasn't that bad.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.898
I don't get it. I wanted
to get angry with him
when he took my hand but...

09:57.931 --> 10:02.102
I felt so... I mean,
his eyes are really...

10:02.135 --> 10:04.037
So this is about his eyes,
now?

10:04.671 --> 10:07.874
He's so direct.
All stare-y like that.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.646
Oh no. Clearly it's the legend
and we've both fallen
under its spell.

10:13.079 --> 10:18.051
Have you considered
the possibility that you might
just like each other?

10:18.084 --> 10:23.056
(gasps) No! Of course
that's not possible!
I have a boyfriend.

10:24.324 --> 10:28.094
Holding my hand
for everyone to see.
What about my reputation?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.397
Dude, you connected
with him in a dance.
It's totally cool.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.167
But everyone was watching!

10:36.169 --> 10:38.939
Did you see her
just fold in half?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.941
Totally folded.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.310
Who does she think she is?
I'm a much better dancer
than her.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
(Kennedy) Totally better.

10:46.012 --> 10:50.116
Did you see the way
she was looking at him?

10:50.884 --> 10:58.291
No. No. I didn't see anything.
Nothing to see really.
It's just a dance.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.295
No biggie.
-(chuckles) Yeah...
Totally just a dance.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.867
Yeah! A total dance of
love...
(chuckles)

11:10.436 --> 11:14.941
Thea's going to destroy me.
Oh! Should I just tell her
it's the legend?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.944
Yeah... no.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.350
Why are cats scared of
trees?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.887
Why?
-Because of their bark.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.855
(all laugh)

11:28.889 --> 11:31.457
(classical piano music plays)

11:32.192 --> 11:34.294
(Max) Ah.
-(students gasp)

11:35.295 --> 11:37.463
I'm really sorry.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.332
(whispers) Once more? Come
on.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.481
(Jeff) Argh! Darn it!

11:55.516 --> 11:58.018
Maybe I can show it to
her, sir?
I know the choreography.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.353
As long as you don't
butcher it,
be my guest.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.176
(all applaud)

13:30.210 --> 13:33.113
(Etienne)
Nailed it! Bravo. Switch parts.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.447
If that's what
you think is best.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.582
No, please, let me try again.

13:35.616 --> 13:39.285
We don't have that kind of time.
Let's go. From the top.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.166
(machine whirs)

13:53.199 --> 13:55.536
This is so far out.

13:55.569 --> 13:59.940
It's a portal
which allows you to travel
during non-portal times.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.577
If this works the way
I think it does, it could
penetrate the bubble Lena's in.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.613
Seriously?
Then how do I find one?

14:06.647 --> 14:07.881
You don't.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.884
Oscar, if this
helps me get to Lena,
I need to find one.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.553
You'd have to build it,
but...

14:12.586 --> 14:16.957
Come on! We built a model,
we can definitively build
the real thing.

14:17.591 --> 14:21.528
But you could
damage time... forever.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.540
(Frank) Yes!
I can see the plans.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.083
(Clive chuckles)

14:51.525 --> 14:55.161
I know I kept making mistakes
but I was distracted
by the legend.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.263
There is no way she's
stealing the Fairy from me.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.166
As much as I'd like to agree
with you about this so-called
legend...

15:00.200 --> 15:03.269
Okay, if I was talking
about analytical geometry,
you'd swoon.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.140
But because
this is about L-O-V-E,
you get all weird and shifty.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.276
No, I don't!
So what're you going to do?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.513
I am not losing The Fairy.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.481
(Ines chuckles)

15:16.517 --> 15:22.122
(Dash) Yes! (laughs)
(makes winning noises)

15:23.557 --> 15:27.493
(Ines) OK. Give me a
controller
and winner gets to be
Tree number 1.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.197
Is that even a thing?
-Yeah. Queen of the Forest.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.566
(Dash) OK.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.237
Give me the controller.
Game on!
-Dash Khan. Tree number one.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.673
(Dash) Let's do this!

15:40.473 --> 15:45.078
(music plays) (Ines and
Dash make playful noises)

15:46.112 --> 15:49.282
And, 360!
-And 360 the other way.

15:49.315 --> 15:54.120
Up and down!
And up and down!
Ah, ah!

15:55.055 --> 15:58.024
Queen of the Forest!
Queen of the Forest!
Queen of the Forest!

15:58.058 --> 16:02.262
Bam bam!
Here we go, here we go.
(laughs)

16:06.299 --> 16:10.003
I'm gonna take you down!
Paw! Boom!

16:10.036 --> 16:14.174
Okay, watch this.
Boom, tsh, down!

16:14.508 --> 16:16.677
(all) Whoa!

16:19.279 --> 16:24.618
(Ines) Ten. Ten.
Tough break. Tree number 2.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.053
(Dash) Haa!

16:28.689 --> 16:31.157
(classical piano music plays)

16:33.760 --> 16:37.497
She's so good.
-(Kennedy) She's so pretty.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.235
I love her knees!
-What?

16:46.406 --> 16:50.110
Earth to Lena.
That's the wrong choreography.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.079
The role of the Fairy
was given to the dancer
who can actually perform it

16:53.113 --> 16:56.617
without falling flat
on her face. As in... moi.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.144
(Jeff) Trays down,
traitors!

17:24.878 --> 17:27.581
You cannot engage
in a competish without me.

17:27.614 --> 17:33.053
What if my destiny is to become
King of the Trees? How dare you
deny me. I'm a really good tree!

17:33.554 --> 17:35.822
You snooze, you lose.

17:35.856 --> 17:40.460
(scoffs) There's no snoozing.
I don't lose.
Not gonna happen, buddy.

17:40.493 --> 17:45.331
How about this. I
challenge
both of you to a Tree-off.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.735
OK, I'm in. Even though
I'm already Queen of the Trees.

17:48.769 --> 17:53.206
(Dash) You won a video game.
Hardly falls under
the tree category. I'm in.

17:53.239 --> 17:57.143
OK. Who can hold
the tree pose the longest.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.383
We have two minutes
until history.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.852
No challenge is too great.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.792
(Ines chuckles) Whoa!
-Easy! Oh!

18:11.825 --> 18:13.727
(laughs) I'm the King
of the Tree... Whoa!

18:28.609 --> 18:32.312
This is going to work.
This will create an intense
gravitational field.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.915
Getting the balance will be
kind of tricky, though...

18:34.948 --> 18:38.184
Is that long division?
(whispers) Cause I was never
any good at that.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.787
No, Clive. It's a miracle.

18:41.822 --> 18:46.192
Supplies.
Get them back here.
Immediately.

18:47.928 --> 18:52.398
Boys. We're going to create
our very own time transporter.

18:57.738 --> 18:59.906
(Jeff) Oh yes! Paper over
rock.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.441
(Dash) Scissors cut paper.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.909
This was dynamite.

19:02.943 --> 19:06.913
Rematch.
-Sorry to interrupt...
whatever this is.
Can I borrow you?

19:06.947 --> 19:08.314
OK. Timeout.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.252
(Jeff) Whoa, whoa. Usually
you finish a match
once it's started...

19:12.285 --> 19:14.755
We need to settle this.

19:14.788 --> 19:21.427
OK. New game. First person
to say ballet is out.
Same with the second.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.964
(Jeff) Wow, harsh
challenge. Not!

19:23.997 --> 19:31.237
Dash? I was gonna say, I was
wondering if you wanted to grab
a bite to eat after class?

19:32.472 --> 19:36.442
Yeah. Sure. OK.
Right after ballet tech, yeah?

19:37.243 --> 19:39.513
(chuckles) She got you!
-Oh man.

19:39.880 --> 19:44.384
That was deep-rooted sabotage.
Nice. You totally said ballet.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.987
Oh. And so did you.
-(Jeff sighs)

19:47.020 --> 19:51.992
And that makes me,
Queen of the Forest.
And Tree number 1 to you, boys.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.426
(Jeff)
She isn't Queen of the Forest...

19:53.927 --> 19:57.330
It's still a date, yeah?
-No...

20:02.669 --> 20:06.707
OK. Could you dance
Max's part with me?

20:06.740 --> 20:11.377
I need to not be distracted
by, you know...
(whispers) The legend.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.815
But Lena...
what if you fall
in love with me?

20:15.849 --> 20:18.251
Ines. I'm serious!
-(laughs)

20:18.284 --> 20:20.386
Okay, sure. I can do it.

20:21.988 --> 20:27.293
Check it, chica.
Watch and learn.
Relax so I can take the lead.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.897
(chuckles) Not funny!
-Well, that is
how he talks, Lena.

20:30.931 --> 20:35.335
OK. So don't freak out.
But the boy has to have his
hands tightly around your waist.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.403
That's normal nowadays.
It helps you to balance.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.439
OK.
-OK?

20:39.840 --> 20:44.377
Henri helped me with this.
He was always there for me
when I needed it.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.553
Haven't you stopped
since I left?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.320
I've got to get this.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.757
Here. Hold on to me.
-OK.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.895
(laughs) No, Henri.
OK. Here. OK.

21:04.698 --> 21:07.400
(Lena laughs)
OK, let's try again.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.037
(gasps)

21:12.639 --> 21:14.741
Henri! I'm doing it!
-Yes, you are!

21:14.775 --> 21:16.877
Thank you!
-(both laugh)

21:37.564 --> 21:39.866
Relax, chica.

21:46.940 --> 21:51.712
Why is she dancing my part,
at my school, with my boyfriend?
With her eyes closed!

21:51.745 --> 21:53.714
It's just a dance.

22:07.628 --> 22:11.097
(Etienne) Stop. Do it
again.

22:14.901 --> 22:20.941
(Ines) Boys. I believe
I should be center stage.
Fetch me my fan, Tree number 2.

22:20.974 --> 22:24.711
(scoffs) Last time I checked
I was Tree number 1!
-(Ines chuckles)

23:45.491 --> 23:47.661
(all cheer and applaud)

23:47.694 --> 23:51.031
Brava! Brava! Brava!

23:51.064 --> 23:53.800
(whispers to herself)
It's just the legend...

23:53.834 --> 23:54.868
That was awesome.

23:56.169 --> 24:00.073
(beating heart, ticking clock)
(machine whirring)

24:00.106 --> 24:03.877
I feel weird.
Something's wrong.

24:04.678 --> 24:08.148
With Lena, I mean.
I can feel it.

24:08.181 --> 24:10.450
That's love waves.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.587
Is that in the travel
book?

24:13.620 --> 24:17.958
Page three thousand and six.
We need a mathematician
or a scientist or something.

24:19.259 --> 24:21.595
Do you know anyone?
-Do I ever.

24:21.628 --> 24:26.567
Einstein was here once.
Isaac Newton comes by
every now and then.

24:30.537 --> 24:36.042
I can feel it again.
I need to go.
I'll be back later.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.812
See you later.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.247
Love waves...

24:45.051 --> 24:48.021
I still can't get over
the look on Thea's face!

24:48.054 --> 24:49.489
It was your part to begin
with.

24:49.523 --> 24:52.092
I'm just glad I got
through it
without succumbing
to the legend.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.094
(sarcastic) Yeah...
that was something.

24:55.596 --> 24:56.897
Thank you.

24:58.031 --> 25:02.636
A handwritten letter.
Of course. Thank you.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.507
Don't ever steal my part again.
Or you'll regret it.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.878
I promise you Lena,
who-ever-you-are,
you will have regrets. Big ones.

25:11.912 --> 25:15.782
What are you talking about?
I was the Fairy. You stole
my part. I just took it back.

25:16.750 --> 25:17.951
That's not the point!

25:19.720 --> 25:20.654
Should I be worried?

25:20.954 --> 25:22.288
Maybe a little bit.

25:22.956 --> 25:26.059
I noticed a Tae Kwon Dooh class
on the school announcement...
-Do!

25:26.092 --> 25:28.929
Tae Kwon Do class on the
school announcement board.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.296
That's
the defensive arts, right?

25:30.330 --> 25:34.935
Yeah, you're learning.
And, it's not a bad idea.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.070
Oh! Stop it! (chuckles)

25:37.971 --> 25:39.740
(both laugh)

25:43.877 --> 25:47.681
(Lena) And in the end,
I stood up for myself
and got the part back.

25:47.714 --> 25:52.986
It was kind of a milestone day.
Oh... I need
to record that one!

25:55.722 --> 26:00.160
(Lena into phone)
Dear Video Diary.
I totally did it.

26:00.193 --> 26:04.264
And it was amazing! Henri...

26:05.298 --> 26:08.101
I wish you were here.
I miss you.

26:24.685 --> 26:26.319
Good night, Henri.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.591
(whooshing, clock ticking)

26:35.962 --> 26:39.065
(Henri) Things here
have been challenging.
But I've made some
headway.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.835
I think we've found
a way to get to you.

26:41.868 --> 26:47.774
It's not for sure,
but worth investigating. I miss
you so much.
