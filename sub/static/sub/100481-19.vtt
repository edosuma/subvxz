WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

COMING TO YOU FROM

THIS BLANK VOID.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.200

00:37.266 --> 00:40.166

00:55.566 --> 00:57.000
WHICH I WILL SAY, IN TERMS OF

00:57.066 --> 00:59.000

"I'VE MET GHISLANE MAXWELL

MULTIPLE TIMES, AND I WISH HER

01:04.733 --> 01:05.800
WITH WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN

01:05.866 --> 01:06.533
PORTLAND.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.033
THE NATURE VALLEY GRANOLA BAR OF

01:08.100 --> 01:09.033
U.S. CITIES, IN THAT IT'S

01:09.100 --> 01:10.666
CRUNCHY, MESSY, AND, LET'S BE

01:13.066 --> 01:14.666
THE NEWS THIS WEEK HAS BEEN

01:14.733 --> 01:16.266
DOMINATED BY SHOCKING IMAGES

01:16.333 --> 01:18.366
FROM PORTLAND LIKE THESE.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.800
>> THE U.S. ATTORNEY NOW WANTS

01:19.866 --> 01:21.266
AN INVESTIGATION IN PORTLAND

01:21.333 --> 01:23.100
AFTER VIDEOS SURFACED SHOWING

01:23.166 --> 01:25.133
UNIDENTIFIED CAMOUFLAGED AGENTS

01:25.200 --> 01:26.600
ARRESTING PROTESTERS AND PUTTING

01:26.666 --> 01:29.366
THEM INTO UNMARKED CARS.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.366
AND THIS DISTURBING VIDEO SHOWS

01:31.433 --> 01:33.166
THE AGENTS BEATING A NAVY

01:33.233 --> 01:34.566
VETERAN WITH BATONS AND THEN

01:34.633 --> 01:38.033
DOUSING HIM WITH PEPPER SPRAY

01:38.100 --> 01:39.500
WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE WAS TRYING

01:39.566 --> 01:40.600
TO ENGAGE THEM IN A CIVIL

01:43.900 --> 01:45.333
>> John: WOW, THAT IS INTENSE.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.600
AND IT FRANKLY SAYS SO MUCH

01:46.666 --> 01:47.666
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW

01:47.733 --> 01:49.100
THAT CNN WILL SHOW FEDERAL

01:49.166 --> 01:50.933
AGENTS TREAT A HUMAN BEING LIKE

01:51.000 --> 01:52.800
A PINATA, YET CENSOR THAT SAME

01:52.866 --> 01:54.566
MAN FOR RIGHTFULLY TELLING THOSE

01:54.633 --> 01:56.800
AGENTS TO FUCK THE FUCK OFF.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.833
LOOK, WE'RE ALREADY WITNESSING

01:58.900 --> 02:00.266
THE RAPID DECLINE OF AMERICAN

02:00.333 --> 02:01.100
CIVIL LIBERTIES HERE,

02:01.166 --> 02:02.133
LET'S TRY NOT TO BE FUCKING

02:02.200 --> 02:03.233
PRUDES ABOUT IT.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.800
THE PROTESTS IN PORTLAND HAVE

02:04.866 --> 02:06.366
BEEN GOING ON DAILY FOR NEARLY

02:06.433 --> 02:07.366
TWO MONTHS NOW, SINCE THE

02:07.433 --> 02:08.600
KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.133
BUT THE DEPLOYMENT OF FEDERAL

02:10.200 --> 02:11.200
AGENTS WAS A SHARP ESCALATION,

02:11.266 --> 02:13.033
OF QUESTIONABLE LEGALITY.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.800
AND YET, TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT

02:14.866 --> 02:15.866
TELL IT, HE HAD NO CHOICE, AND

02:15.933 --> 02:17.566
IT WAS A TERRIFIC IDEA.

02:17.633 --> 02:18.733
>> WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB IN

02:18.800 --> 02:19.966
PORTLAND.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.600
PORTLAND WAS VERY ROUGH AND THEY

02:21.666 --> 02:22.533
CALLED US IN, AND WE DID A GOOD

02:22.600 --> 02:24.000
JOB, TO PUT IT MILDLY.

02:24.066 --> 02:26.900
MANY PEOPLE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.

02:26.966 --> 02:28.166
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: IT'S NEVER

02:28.233 --> 02:30.600
GOOD WHEN TRUMP SAYS HE'S DOING

02:30.666 --> 02:31.933
A "GREAT JOB," GIVEN THAT HE

02:32.000 --> 02:32.833
THINKS HIS ADMINISTRATION IS

02:32.900 --> 02:34.700
DOING A "GREAT JOB" DEALING WITH

02:34.766 --> 02:35.700
THE CORONAVIRUS, AND HE ONCE

02:35.766 --> 02:36.866
PROCLAIMED "BEN AFFLECK WOULD DO

02:36.933 --> 02:38.500
A GREAT JOB AS BATMAN."

02:38.566 --> 02:39.766
CLEARLY, THIS MAN HAS NO SENSE

02:39.833 --> 02:40.933
OF WHAT A GREAT JOB ACTUALLY

02:41.000 --> 02:42.633
LOOKS LIKE.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.033
AND FOR THE RECORD, THOSE AGENTS

02:44.100 --> 02:45.766
WERE VERY MUCH NOT CALLED IN.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.033
OREGON'S GOVERNOR QUICKLY

02:47.100 --> 02:48.533
ANNOUNCED THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
THEM THERE, AND THAT "THE

02:49.666 --> 02:51.233
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD REMOVE

02:51.300 --> 02:52.433
THEM FROM OUR STREETS," AND

02:52.500 --> 02:53.800
PORTLAND'S MAYOR, TED WHEELER,

02:53.866 --> 02:55.333
SAID PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.433
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY

02:56.500 --> 02:57.300
ARE SHARPLY ESCALATING THE

02:57.366 --> 02:58.700
SITUATION.

02:58.766 --> 03:00.266
THEY'RE NOT WANTED HERE.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.100
WE HAVEN'T ASKED THEM HERE.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.900
IN FACT, WE WANT THEM TO LEAVE.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.266
>> John: YEAH, MASKED

03:06.333 --> 03:07.366
INDIVIDUALS THROWING PEOPLE INTO

03:07.433 --> 03:08.333
AN UNMARKED VAN IS NEVER A GOOD

03:08.400 --> 03:09.966
IDEA IF YOU WANT TO DE-ESCALATE

03:10.033 --> 03:11.333
A SITUATION.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.733
IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD IDEA FOR

03:12.800 --> 03:15.400
A SURPRISE BACHELORETTE PARTY.

03:15.466 --> 03:16.833
"WOW, YOU GOT ME, I HONESTLY

03:16.900 --> 03:18.000
THOUGHT I WAS BEING KIDNAPPED

03:18.066 --> 03:19.033
THERE FOR A SECOND.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.533
MY LIFE FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES,

03:20.600 --> 03:22.400
AND I THINK I MAY'VE SHIT

03:22.466 --> 03:23.733
MYSELF, BUT YOU GIRLS ARE THE

03:23.800 --> 03:25.166
BEST -- BRING ON THE STRIPPERS."

03:25.233 --> 03:26.700
AND THE REASON FEDERAL AGENTS

03:26.766 --> 03:28.066
WERE NOT CALLED IN MIGHT BE

03:28.133 --> 03:29.566
THAT THINGS WEREN'T ACTUALLY

03:29.633 --> 03:30.700
ESPECIALLY DIRE IN PORTLAND.

03:30.766 --> 03:32.000
PROTESTS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY

03:32.066 --> 03:33.566
PEACEFUL THERE.

03:33.633 --> 03:34.933
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THERE

03:35.000 --> 03:36.100
HAVEN'T BEEN SOME ISOLATED,

03:36.166 --> 03:36.933
CHAOTIC INCIDENTS.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.700
ALTHOUGH THOSE SITUATIONS HAVE

03:38.766 --> 03:40.133
NOT BEEN HELPED BY THE FACT

03:40.200 --> 03:41.700
THE LOCAL POLICE FORCE -- UNDER

03:41.766 --> 03:42.966
THE LEADERSHIP OF TED WHEELER,

03:43.033 --> 03:44.633
INCIDENTALLY -- HAVE ROUTINELY

03:44.700 --> 03:46.133
OVERREACTED, USING THINGS LIKE

03:46.200 --> 03:47.833
TEAR GAS, TO THE POINT WHERE

03:47.900 --> 03:49.800
WHEELER ACTUALLY BECAME KNOWN AS

03:49.866 --> 03:51.100
"TEAR GAS TEDDY," WHICH, I CAN

03:51.166 --> 03:53.000
GUARANTEE YOU, IS SET TO BE THIS

03:53.066 --> 03:54.500
CHRISTMAS'S WORST-SELLING TOY.

03:54.566 --> 03:57.266
AND THEY HAVE JUSTIFIED

03:57.333 --> 03:58.866
DANGEROUS CROWD-CONTROL TACTICS

03:58.933 --> 04:00.233
BY RELEASING PHOTOS LIKE THIS,

04:00.300 --> 04:01.100
CLAIMING THEY'D BEEN ATTACKED

04:01.166 --> 04:04.933
WITH, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

04:05.000 --> 04:05.966
A CAN OF WHITE CLAW

04:06.033 --> 04:07.166
AND A HALF-EATEN APPLE.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.366
WHICH IS LESS A THREATENING

04:08.433 --> 04:09.133
DISPLAY OF WEAPONRY AND MORE OF

04:09.200 --> 04:10.266
A SUMMONING CIRCLE FOR GHOSTS

04:10.333 --> 04:11.133
WHO DIED ON DAY THREE OF

04:11.200 --> 04:12.066
BURNING MAN.

04:12.133 --> 04:13.166
AND FOR ALL THE TALK BY TRUMP

04:13.233 --> 04:14.966
AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS OF

04:15.033 --> 04:16.700
THE NEED TO RESTORE ORDER IN

04:16.766 --> 04:18.000
PORTLAND, THOSE ON THE GROUND

04:18.066 --> 04:20.400
WILL TELL YOU, IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

04:20.466 --> 04:22.433
WHAT'S BEING PORTRAYED.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.033
>> WHAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THAT

04:24.100 --> 04:26.800
THE VOLUME THAT IS BEING

04:26.866 --> 04:28.400
DESCRIBED BY DHS AND INCLUDING

04:28.466 --> 04:29.133
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOESN'T

04:29.200 --> 04:30.333
SEEM TO SQUARE WITH WHAT'S GOING

04:30.400 --> 04:31.366
ON HERE ON THE GROUND.

04:31.433 --> 04:33.333
YEAH, YOU DO HAVE RIOTERS,

04:33.400 --> 04:34.233
YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE,

04:34.300 --> 04:35.533
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO DEFACE THIS

04:35.600 --> 04:37.033
BUILDING, BUT IT'S NOT AS THOUGH

04:37.100 --> 04:38.500
THIS IS OVERWHELMING CHAOS.

04:38.566 --> 04:40.000
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE

04:40.066 --> 04:40.733
CITY BLOCK THAT'S THE EPICENTER

04:40.800 --> 04:41.300
HERE.

04:41.366 --> 04:42.866
>> John: EXACTLY.

04:42.933 --> 04:44.400
IT'S ABOUT ONE BLOCK THAT WAS

04:44.466 --> 04:46.400
ACTUALLY STARTING TO SEE FEWER

04:46.466 --> 04:47.600
CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN

04:47.666 --> 04:48.700
PROTESTORS AND POLICE BEFORE

04:48.766 --> 04:50.233
FEDERAL AGENTS MOVED IN.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.366
OR, IF YOU WATCH FOX NEWS,

04:52.433 --> 04:53.500
IT'S THE END OF AMERICA

04:53.566 --> 04:55.700
AS WE KNOW IT.

04:55.766 --> 04:57.300
>> FOR MORE THAN SIX WEEKS NOW,

04:57.366 --> 04:59.366
THE CITY OF PORTLAND HAS BEEN

04:59.433 --> 05:00.933
UNDER SIEGE BY RADICAL LEFTIST

05:01.033 --> 05:03.100
MOBS WHO ARE INTENT ON

05:03.166 --> 05:04.400
DESTROYING EVERYTHING AMERICA

05:04.466 --> 05:05.833
STANDS FOR.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.266
>> PORTLAND HAS NOW EXPERIENCED

05:07.333 --> 05:09.166
50 STRAIGHT DAYS OF LEFT-WING

05:09.233 --> 05:09.966
VIOLENCE.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.300
>> WE ARE WATCHING A WAR

05:11.366 --> 05:13.000
ON THE STREETS OF PORTLAND.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.400
>> THREE FEDERAL COURTHOUSES

05:14.466 --> 05:16.166
HAVE NOW BEEN DAMAGED ON

05:16.233 --> 05:17.366
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.133
THE HATFIELD COURTHOUSE WAS

05:19.200 --> 05:21.033
FIREBOMBED.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.266
THE U.S. CUSTOM HOUSE WAS

05:23.333 --> 05:23.566
VANDALIZED.

05:23.633 --> 05:24.433
POLICE WERE ATTACKED WITH

05:24.500 --> 05:25.233
LASERS.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.166
SEVERAL OFFICERS NOW ASSAULTED

05:26.233 --> 05:28.200
WITH SLEDGEHAMMERS.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.533
STORES WERE BROKEN INTO,

05:29.600 --> 05:31.900
BUILDINGS WERE SET ON FIRE.

05:31.966 --> 05:33.833
THIS IS INSANE.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.400
>> John: YEAH, IT IS INSANE,

05:36.466 --> 05:37.266
BECAUSE THAT TONE DOES NOT

05:37.333 --> 05:38.600
HONESTLY REFLECT THE CONDITIONS

05:38.666 --> 05:39.833
ON THE GROUND.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.733
THAT "FIREBOMBING," FOR

05:41.800 --> 05:42.733
INSTANCE, SEEMS TO BE A

05:42.800 --> 05:44.266
REFERENCE TO EITHER A FIREWORK

05:44.333 --> 05:45.833
OR A SMALL FIRE THAT WAS SET,

05:45.900 --> 05:47.133
WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

05:47.200 --> 05:48.133
DRAMATIC THAN HE IS TRYING TO

05:48.200 --> 05:49.433
MAKE IT SOUND.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.433
AND THAT ROLLING LIST NEXT TO

05:51.500 --> 05:52.500
HANNITY'S HEAD IS MOSTLY

05:52.566 --> 05:53.566
GRAFFITI.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.233
IN FACT, "GRAFFITI" IS LISTED

05:55.300 --> 05:56.466
12 TIMES IN A ROW THERE,

05:56.533 --> 05:58.000
UNDER THE HEADLINE

05:58.066 --> 05:58.900
"VIOLENCE IN PORTLAND,"

05:58.966 --> 06:01.033
WHICH IS A HUGE OVERSTATEMENT.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.566
AND AT THAT POINT,

06:02.633 --> 06:03.533
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS

06:03.600 --> 06:04.533
ACCURATE IF THAT HEADING HAD

06:04.600 --> 06:06.200
SAID "CANNIBALISM IN PORTLAND,"

06:06.266 --> 06:07.433
OR "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRES IN

06:07.500 --> 06:08.333
PORTLAND" OR

06:08.400 --> 06:09.900
"9/11s IN PORTLAND."

06:09.966 --> 06:11.633
LOOK, THE TROUBLING THING HERE

06:11.700 --> 06:13.733
IS, PORTLAND SEEMS TO BE BEING

06:13.800 --> 06:18.733
USED AS A STAGING GROUND BY THE

06:18.800 --> 06:19.600
PRESIDENT TO PUT ON AN

06:19.666 --> 06:20.666
AUTHORITARIAN SHOW OF FORCE.

06:20.733 --> 06:21.766
AND THIS COULD END VERY BADLY,

06:21.833 --> 06:22.566
ESPECIALLY AS HE'S NOW

06:22.633 --> 06:23.733
APPARENTLY THREATENING TO USE

06:23.800 --> 06:27.366
FEDERAL FORCE IN OTHER CITIES

06:27.433 --> 06:28.066
AS WELL, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

06:28.133 --> 06:29.366
OUTRAGEOUS.

06:29.433 --> 06:31.566
AND IF YOU, LIKE TRUMP, THINK

06:31.633 --> 06:32.800
THAT IT IS FINE TO USE FEDERAL

06:32.866 --> 06:33.400
TROOPS AS A PROP TO CRUSH

06:33.466 --> 06:34.566

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REASON

07:55.100 --> 07:56.133
CAMELS ARE SO SEXY.

07:56.200 --> 07:56.933
WITHOUT THOSE LUSCIOUS LASHES,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.133
THEY'D JUST BE LUMPY HORSES WITH

07:58.200 --> 07:59.300
FURRY BACK BOOBS.

YOU REMEMBER, "OH, YEAH.

I'D TOTALLY FUCK A CAMEL."

08:07.566 --> 08:08.566

08:19.200 --> 08:20.600
YOU GUYS HOW TO GET LONG LASHES.

SO THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO

08:22.066 --> 08:23.333
DO IS GRAB YOUR LASH CURLER,

08:23.400 --> 08:24.633
CURL YOUR LASHES OBVIOUSLY, THEN

08:24.700 --> 08:25.866
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THEM DOWN AND

08:25.933 --> 08:27.500
USE YOUR PHONE THAT YOU'RE USING

08:27.566 --> 08:28.700
RIGHT NOW TO SEARCH UP WHAT'S

08:28.766 --> 08:30.133
HAPPENING IN CHINA, HOW THEY'RE

08:30.200 --> 08:31.233
GETTING CONCENTRATION CAMPS,

08:31.300 --> 08:32.733
THROWING INNOCENT MUSLIMS IN

08:32.800 --> 08:33.600
THERE, SEPARATING THEIR FAMILIES

08:33.666 --> 08:34.866
FROM EACH OTHER --

08:34.933 --> 08:35.800
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

08:35.866 --> 08:37.366
HOLD ON, HOLD ON!

08:37.433 --> 08:38.800

08:38.866 --> 08:40.500

LONGER LASHES TO DISCUSSING

08:41.833 --> 08:43.400
CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN JUST

08:43.466 --> 08:44.900

08:44.966 --> 08:46.400
IMPRESSIVE!

AND LOOK, I'M A BIT OF AN EXPERT

08:47.700 --> 08:49.033
AT TAKING SOMETHING FUN AND

08:49.100 --> 08:50.366
QUICKLY RUINING IT, SO THIS IS

08:50.433 --> 08:51.900
GAME RECOGNIZING GAME HERE.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.366
BUT SHE IS RIGHT.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.733
A LASH CURLER IS A VITAL TOOL

08:55.800 --> 08:57.366
IN ANYONE'S BEAUTY ARSENAL, AND

08:57.433 --> 08:58.566
THERE'S AN ETHNIC GROUP IN

08:58.633 --> 08:59.900
CHINA BEING SYSTEMATICALLY

08:59.966 --> 09:01.033
SURVEILLED AND IMPRISONED IN AN

09:01.100 --> 09:02.166
ATTEMPT TO, ESSENTIALLY,

09:02.233 --> 09:02.800
WIPE THEIR CULTURE OFF THE MAP.

09:02.866 --> 09:05.100
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:05.166 --> 09:07.266
LET'S HOLD THE EYELASH STORY

09:07.333 --> 09:08.433
FOR ANOTHER WEEK, AND INSTEAD,

09:08.500 --> 09:09.566
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.633
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN QUESTION

09:10.700 --> 09:11.900
ARE THE UIGHURS.

09:11.966 --> 09:13.166
THEY'RE A MOSTLY MUSLIM ETHNIC

09:13.233 --> 09:14.900
MINORITY IN A REGION OF CHINA

09:14.966 --> 09:16.633
CALLED XINJIANG, AND THE CHINESE

09:16.700 --> 09:18.000
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TREATING

09:18.066 --> 09:20.300
THEM ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLY.

09:20.366 --> 09:22.866
>> A U.N. PANEL SAYS THE REGION

09:22.933 --> 09:25.100
RESEMBLES A MASSIVE INTERNMENT

09:25.166 --> 09:27.233
CAMP, WHERE MORE THAN 1 MILLION

09:27.300 --> 09:29.466
MUSLIM MINORITIES HAVE BEEN

09:29.533 --> 09:31.000
ROUNDED UP, DETAINED, AND

09:31.066 --> 09:32.366
FORCIBLY INDOCTRINATED

09:32.433 --> 09:34.900
BY THE CHINESE REGIME.

09:34.966 --> 09:36.933
WITNESS ACCOUNTS, SATELLITE

09:37.000 --> 09:39.066
IMAGERY, AND COMMUNIST PARTY

09:39.133 --> 09:41.333
DOCUMENTS REVEAL WHAT APPEARS

09:41.400 --> 09:43.100
TO BE THE LARGEST IMPRISONMENT

09:43.166 --> 09:44.533
OF PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR

09:44.600 --> 09:47.933
RELIGION SINCE THE HOLOCAUST.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.100
>> John: WOW.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.566
SAYING ANYTHING IS THE LARGEST

09:50.633 --> 09:51.600
"SINCE THE HOLOCAUST"

09:51.666 --> 09:52.466
AUTOMATICALLY MAKES WHATEVER

09:52.533 --> 09:53.900
YOU'VE JUST SAID WORSE.

09:53.966 --> 09:54.566
THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF SHOES?

09:54.633 --> 09:56.033
FUN!

09:56.100 --> 09:56.933
THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF SHOES

09:57.000 --> 09:58.100
SINCE THE HOLOCAUST?

09:58.166 --> 09:59.666
OH, BOY.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.766
ALL OF A SUDDEN, REALLY, REALLY

10:00.833 --> 10:04.266
NOT FUN.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.866
AND IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

10:05.933 --> 10:07.100
THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT AN

10:07.166 --> 10:07.900
ESTIMATED MILLION PEOPLE WHO'VE

10:07.966 --> 10:08.933
BEEN HELD IN DETENTION CAMPS --

10:09.000 --> 10:10.366
MOSTLY UIGHURS, BUT ALSO KAZAKHS

10:10.433 --> 10:11.366
AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITIES --

10:11.433 --> 10:12.900
YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

10:12.966 --> 10:14.533
AND IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE CHINA

10:14.600 --> 10:16.333
HAS DONE ITS LEVEL BEST TO KEEP

10:16.400 --> 10:17.466
THIS STORY FROM GETTING OUT,

10:17.533 --> 10:18.466
BUT IT MAY BE GETTING HARDER

10:18.533 --> 10:20.100
TO IGNORE.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.533
JUST THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT

10:21.600 --> 10:23.366
YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A PERSONAL

10:23.433 --> 10:24.100
CONNECTION TO THIS WITHOUT EVEN

10:24.166 --> 10:25.833
KNOWING IT.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.733
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, UIGHURS

10:27.800 --> 10:28.866
ARE BEING SHIPPED -- NOT ALWAYS

10:28.933 --> 10:29.766
WILLINGLY -- TO WORK IN

10:29.833 --> 10:31.266
FACTORIES ACROSS CHINA.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.733
AND SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THEY'RE

10:32.800 --> 10:34.266
MAKING MAY BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF

10:34.333 --> 10:35.200
YOUR FACE.

10:35.266 --> 10:36.333
>> IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE

10:36.400 --> 10:37.666
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND

10:37.733 --> 10:39.000
THE WORLD WEARING A FACE MASK

10:39.066 --> 10:41.666
BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS

10:41.733 --> 10:42.800
PANDEMIC, THIS FOOTAGE MAY

10:42.866 --> 10:44.366
CONCERN YOU.

10:44.433 --> 10:45.800
IT SHOWS A GROUP OF UIGHURS

10:45.866 --> 10:47.500
ARRIVING AT A TEXTILE COMPANY

10:47.566 --> 10:48.633
THAT STARTED PRODUCING MASKS

10:48.700 --> 10:50.666
IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.166
WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL CHINESE

10:52.233 --> 10:53.133
COMPANIES THAT USE UIGHUR LABOR

10:53.200 --> 10:55.133
TO PRODUCE PPE.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.900
AND WE TRACKED SOME OF THEIR

10:56.966 --> 10:58.133
SHIPMENTS TO CONSUMERS IN THE

10:58.200 --> 10:59.433
U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.900
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

11:00.966 --> 11:02.433
THE VERY MASKS THAT SOME

11:02.500 --> 11:04.200
IN THIS COUNTRY SEE AS

11:04.266 --> 11:06.033
UNACCEPTABLE INFRINGEMENTS

11:06.100 --> 11:07.533
ON THEIR PERSONAL LIBERTY MAY BE

11:07.600 --> 11:08.500
GETTING MADE BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD

11:08.566 --> 11:10.233
ABSOLUTELY LOVE FOR THEIR

11:10.300 --> 11:10.833
WORST INFRINGEMENT TO BE

11:10.900 --> 11:14.000
GETTING POLITELY ASKED

11:14.066 --> 11:17.466
TO LEAVE A FUCKING COSTCO.

11:17.533 --> 11:18.200
AND WHILE THERE IS CLEARLY

11:18.266 --> 11:19.200
NOTHING NEW ABOUT HORRIFIC

11:19.266 --> 11:20.033
PRACTICES BEING HIDDEN DEEP

11:20.100 --> 11:22.400
IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF GLOBAL

11:22.466 --> 11:23.400
CAPITALISM, WHAT IS HAPPENING

11:23.466 --> 11:24.733
TO THE UIGHURS IS PARTICULARLY

11:24.800 --> 11:25.000
APPALLING.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.200
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

11:26.266 --> 11:26.966
THEM -- WHO THEY ARE, WHAT'S

11:27.033 --> 11:28.366
BEEN HAPPENING TO THEM, AND WHY.

11:28.433 --> 11:29.100
AND LET'S START WITH A BIT OF

11:29.166 --> 11:30.733
CONTEXT.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.066
ABOUT 11 MILLION UIGHURS LIVE

11:34.133 --> 11:34.566
IN XINJIANG, IN THE FAR

11:34.633 --> 11:35.533
NORTHWEST CORNER OF CHINA.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.500
IT'S RESOURCE-RICH AND

11:37.566 --> 11:39.566
IT'S STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.433
BUT UIGHURS HAVE ALWAYS HAD

11:40.500 --> 11:42.100
AN UNCOMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP

11:42.166 --> 11:45.933
WITH THE AUTHORITIES IN BEIJING,

11:46.000 --> 11:46.733
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.900
AND ARE CULTURALLY AND

11:48.966 --> 11:50.500
ETHNICALLY DISTINCT FROM THE

11:50.566 --> 11:54.366
REST OF CHINESE POPULATION,

11:54.433 --> 11:55.033
WHICH IS MORE THAN 90% HAN

11:55.100 --> 11:55.966
CHINESE.

11:56.033 --> 11:56.933
ON TOP OF WHICH, THERE'S

11:57.000 --> 11:58.100
THE FACT UIGHURS ARE MUSLIM

11:58.166 --> 11:58.900
IN A COUNTRY THAT IS

11:58.966 --> 11:59.700
AGGRESSIVELY SECULAR.

11:59.766 --> 12:00.666
SO MUCH SO THAT A FEW YEARS AGO,

12:00.733 --> 12:01.533
A CHINESE REALITY SHOW WENT TO

12:01.600 --> 12:02.633
DUBAI, AND STATE TV CENSORED

12:02.700 --> 12:06.366
ALL DEPICTIONS OF A WOMAN

12:06.433 --> 12:07.266
IN A HEADSCARF IN THE WEIRDEST

12:07.333 --> 12:08.633
POSSIBLE WAY, COVERING IT WITH

12:08.700 --> 12:10.433
A CARTOON HELMET AND A SHOCK OF

12:10.500 --> 12:12.133
YELLOW HAIR WITH A GHOST IN IT,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.966
AND COVERING HER HIJAB BY

12:14.033 --> 12:15.466
OBSCURING HER COMPLETELY

12:15.533 --> 12:17.666
WITH A CACTUS IN A SANTA HAT,

12:17.733 --> 12:18.633
EVEN DOING THAT WHEN SHE WAS

12:18.700 --> 12:19.566
REFLECTED IN ANOTHER PERSON'S

12:19.633 --> 12:21.033
SUNGLASSES.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.100
AND SETTING ASIDE THE ISSUE OF

12:23.166 --> 12:24.433
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR A SECOND,

12:24.500 --> 12:25.866
THAT'S AN AMAZING WAY TO CENSOR

12:25.933 --> 12:27.766
SOMEONE OUT OF A TV SHOW.

12:27.833 --> 12:28.933
I'M JUST SAYING, WATCHING OLD

12:29.000 --> 12:30.966
EPISODES OF "HOUSE OF CARDS"

12:31.033 --> 12:32.833
WOULD BE MUCH LESS UNCOMFORTABLE

12:32.900 --> 12:34.333
IF IT LOOKED LIKE THIS INSTEAD.

12:34.400 --> 12:41.133
>> WHY'D YOU ASK HIM TO LEAVE?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.433
>> BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO LOOK

12:43.500 --> 12:45.666
IN YOUR EYES ONE MORE TIME

12:45.733 --> 12:47.800
BEFORE WE DO THIS.

12:47.866 --> 12:50.633
>> FRANCIS, WE'RE DOING THIS.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.933
>> John: SEE?

12:54.000 --> 12:54.633
THAT'S JUST OBJECTIVELY MUCH

12:54.700 --> 12:55.733
BETTER!

12:55.800 --> 12:57.166
AND NOW YOU CAN ENJOY

12:57.233 --> 12:58.333
"HOUSE OF CARDS" JUST AS MUCH AS

12:58.400 --> 13:03.600
YOU USED TO, WHICH WAS A BIT.

13:03.666 --> 13:04.933
SO THERE WAS THAT BASELINE

13:05.000 --> 13:07.600
DIFFERENCE THERE, ON TOP OF

13:07.666 --> 13:12.866
WHICH,

13:12.933 --> 13:13.766
HAN CHINESE

13:13.833 --> 13:14.866
HAVE HELD BIGOTED VIEWS ABOUT

13:14.933 --> 13:15.566
THE UIGHURS.

13:15.633 --> 13:16.466
JUST LISTEN TO THIS INTERVIEW

13:16.533 --> 13:17.433
FROM BACK IN 2008.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.433
>> HERE IN BEIJING, UIGHURS ARE

13:18.500 --> 13:19.533
DISPERSED ACROSS THE CITY.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.866
MANY WORK AT RESTAURANTS AND

13:20.933 --> 13:21.700
STREET STALLS.

13:21.766 --> 13:22.800
THEY STAND OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR

13:22.866 --> 13:23.966
DIFFERENT FEATURES AND DRESS.

13:24.033 --> 13:24.733
SOME HAN CHINESE ARE BLATANTLY

13:24.800 --> 13:27.633
PREJUDICED AGAINST THEM.

13:27.700 --> 13:28.566
>> THE PEOPLE FROM XINJIANG ARE

13:28.633 --> 13:30.166
NOT VERY GOOD.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.666
ROBBERS AND THIEVES.

13:32.733 --> 13:35.033
>> John: WOW.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.100
"ROBBERS AND THIEVES."

13:37.166 --> 13:38.266
THAT IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE WAY TO

13:38.333 --> 13:39.933
DESCRIBE AN ENTIRE ETHNIC GROUP.

13:40.000 --> 13:40.733
IT'S BARELY AN ACCEPTABLE WAY

13:40.800 --> 13:42.433
TO DESCRIBE ALL RACCOONS.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.766
I MEAN, YEAH, THEY ARE

13:43.833 --> 13:44.900
ESSENTIALLY JUST KLEPTOMANIAC

13:44.966 --> 13:45.866
POSSUMS WHO STEAL YOUR TRASH

13:45.933 --> 13:46.800
WITH THEIR SPOOKY LITTLE

13:46.866 --> 13:48.233
DOLL HANDS.

13:48.300 --> 13:56.000
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THEY ARE.

13:56.066 --> 13:56.800
AND ALL OF THIS WAS

13:56.866 --> 13:57.666
EXACERBATED BY THE

13:57.733 --> 13:58.800
CHINESE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGING

13:58.866 --> 13:59.533
HAN PEOPLE TO MIGRATE TO

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
XINJIANG, WITH UIGHURS BEING

14:00.666 --> 14:01.966
MARGINALIZED OUT OF JOBS AND

14:02.033 --> 14:05.000
HOUSING, FOSTERING RESENTMENT --

14:05.066 --> 14:08.166
AND THESE TENSIONS AND

14:08.233 --> 14:09.566
RESENTMENTS FINALLY BOILED OVER

14:09.633 --> 14:10.100
IN 2009

14:10.166 --> 14:11.233
WITH RIOTS IN THE CAPITAL THAT

14:11.300 --> 14:12.266
KILLED 200 PEOPLE, MOSTLY

14:12.333 --> 14:12.800
HAN CHINESE.

14:12.866 --> 14:13.866
BUT RATHER THAN ADDRESS

14:13.933 --> 14:15.500
THE COMPLEX UNDERLYING FACTORS

14:15.566 --> 14:16.833
BEHIND THOSE RIOTS, THE CHINESE

14:16.900 --> 14:18.533
GOVERNMENT SIMPLY PAINTED THEM

14:18.600 --> 14:20.233
AS RELIGIOUS TERRORISM,

14:20.300 --> 14:21.366
BEGINNING A DECADE-LONG

14:21.433 --> 14:22.566
CRACKDOWN THAT'S ESCALATED

14:22.633 --> 14:23.666
STEADILY -- ESPECIALLY AFTER

14:23.733 --> 14:25.300
CHINA'S PRESIDENT, XI JINPING,

14:25.366 --> 14:26.833
CAME TO POWER, AND INSTITUTED

14:26.900 --> 14:28.133
WHAT WAS CALLED THE

14:28.200 --> 14:29.166
"STRIKE HARD" CAMPAIGN AGAINST

14:29.233 --> 14:33.200
VIOLENT TERRORISM IN 2014.

14:33.266 --> 14:34.766
THINK OF IT AS THE PATRIOT ACT

14:34.833 --> 14:36.966
ON STEROIDS, BECAUSE ALL OF A

14:37.033 --> 14:38.233
SUDDEN, UIGHURS STARTED BEING

14:38.300 --> 14:39.233
TREATED LIKE THEY WERE ALL

14:39.300 --> 14:40.533
POTENTIAL TERRORISTS.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.433
IN FACT, XINJIANG IS NOW ONE OF

14:42.500 --> 14:43.866
THE MOST HEAVILY POLICED AREAS

14:43.933 --> 14:44.966
IN THE WORLD, WITH THE

14:45.033 --> 14:46.066
AUTHORITIES SURVEILLING THINGS

14:46.133 --> 14:46.966
THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD FIND

14:47.033 --> 14:49.300
UTTERLY MEANINGLESS.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.166
>> IF YOU GO THROUGH UIGHUR

14:51.233 --> 14:52.400
NEIGHBORHOODS OR SUBURBS, YOU

14:52.466 --> 14:54.266
SEE CAMERAS OVER LITERALLY EVERY

14:54.333 --> 14:55.633
HOUSE ENTRANCE SO THE GOVERNMENT

14:55.700 --> 14:56.566
CAN SEE WHO ENTERS AND WHO

14:56.633 --> 14:57.533
LEAVES.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.300
>> HOW LOW IS THE BAR FOR BEING

14:59.366 --> 15:01.166
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE SYSTEM?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.466
>> ARE YOU SOCIALIZING MORE OR

15:02.533 --> 15:04.600
LESS WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS?

15:04.666 --> 15:05.533
HAVE YOU PUT GAS IN

15:05.600 --> 15:06.666
SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR?

15:06.733 --> 15:07.866
ARE YOU GOING OUT THE FRONT DOOR

15:07.933 --> 15:09.366
OF YOUR HOUSE INSTEAD OF

15:09.433 --> 15:10.733
THE BACK DOOR OF YOUR HOUSE?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.000
THAT'S HOW LOW THE BAR IS.

15:12.066 --> 15:12.866
>> John: OH, IT GOES EVEN

15:12.933 --> 15:14.066
FURTHER.

15:14.133 --> 15:15.433
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A LIST OF

15:15.500 --> 15:16.833
"75 BEHAVIORAL INDICATIONS OF

15:16.900 --> 15:18.700
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM."

15:18.766 --> 15:20.266
WITH SOME AS VAGUE AS "PEOPLE

15:20.333 --> 15:22.033
WHO STORE LARGE AMOUNTS OF

15:22.100 --> 15:23.500
FOOD," "THOSE WHO SMOKE AND

15:23.566 --> 15:25.500
DRINK BUT QUIT DOING SO QUITE

15:25.566 --> 15:26.766
SUDDENLY," AND "THOSE WHO BUY

15:26.833 --> 15:28.100
OR STORE EQUIPMENT SUCH AS

15:28.166 --> 15:28.866
DUMBBELLS WITHOUT OBVIOUS

15:28.933 --> 15:30.366
REASONS."

15:30.433 --> 15:33.900
ALTHOUGH THAT LAST ONE CLEARLY

15:33.966 --> 15:34.766
WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR ME,

15:34.833 --> 15:36.033
CAUSE I GOT TWO PRETTY OBVIOUS

15:36.100 --> 15:36.933
REASONS FOR DUMBBELL OWNERSHIP

15:37.000 --> 15:38.733
RIGHT HERE.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.100
IT'S NOT CALLED A WORKOUT IF

15:40.166 --> 15:41.000
YOU DON'T PUT THE WORK IN,

15:41.066 --> 15:42.000
BROSEPH BRAUN-RAD.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.133
TRUST ME, THEY CALL ME

15:43.200 --> 15:44.166
THE LUNCH LADY, BECAUSE

15:44.233 --> 15:45.900
FROM THE HOURS OF 11:00 TO 1:00,

15:45.966 --> 15:47.333
I DON'T STOP STACKING PLATES.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.466
I CALL THIS ONE JON AND

15:48.533 --> 15:50.033
THIS ONE TAFFER, BECAUSE

15:50.100 --> 15:56.233
TOGETHER, THEY LIFT UP BARS.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.200
BUT LOOK, CHINA DOESN'T JUST

15:59.266 --> 16:00.000
COLLECT THIS INFORMATION,

16:00.066 --> 16:01.033
IT FEEDS IT

16:01.100 --> 16:02.100
INTO A "PREDICTIVE POLICING"

16:02.166 --> 16:03.000
SYSTEM THAT MONITORS FOR

16:03.066 --> 16:03.966
POTENTIAL THREATS.

16:04.033 --> 16:05.066
IN ONE WEEK, IT FLAGGED

16:05.133 --> 16:06.500
THE NAMES OF 24,000 PEOPLE AS

16:06.566 --> 16:13.133
SUSPICIOUS, 15,000 OF WHOM WERE

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
THEN SENT TO REEDUCATION CAMPS.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.366
AND WHEN PRESSED ON WHETHER ANY

16:15.433 --> 16:16.366
OF THIS IS STRICTLY NECESSARY,

16:16.433 --> 16:17.133
CHINESE OFFICIALS WILL ARGUE

16:17.200 --> 16:18.100
THEY'RE SIMPLY BEING PROACTIVE.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.866
>> SOME PEOPLE, BEFORE THEY

16:19.933 --> 16:21.266
COMMIT MURDER, ALREADY SHOW

16:21.333 --> 16:23.133
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF IT.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.933
SHOULD WE WAIT FOR THEM TO

16:25.000 --> 16:25.933
COMMIT A CRIME OR PREVENT IT

16:26.000 --> 16:27.666
FROM HAPPENING?

16:27.733 --> 16:30.533
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS BOTH

16:30.600 --> 16:32.133
INSANE LOGIC, AND ALSO THE EXACT

16:32.200 --> 16:33.500
PLOT OF "MINORITY REPORT,"

16:33.566 --> 16:36.200
WHICH, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT,

16:36.266 --> 16:37.766
VERY BRIEFLY: THE YEAR'S 2054,

16:37.833 --> 16:39.366
TOM CRUISE'S JOHN ANDERTON IS

16:39.433 --> 16:40.733
CHIEF OF WASHINGTON D.C.'S

16:40.800 --> 16:41.700
PRE-CRIME POLICE DEPARTMENT

16:41.766 --> 16:42.366
WHERE MURDERS ARE STOPPED

16:42.433 --> 16:43.966
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

16:44.033 --> 16:44.566
NOW ETHICALLY, THERE ARE SOME

16:44.633 --> 16:45.400
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SYSTEM --

16:45.466 --> 16:46.300
FOR INSTANCE, CAN YOU REALLY BE

16:46.366 --> 16:49.000
SURE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL COMMIT

16:49.066 --> 16:49.566
THE CRIMES THE PRECOGS SAY

16:49.633 --> 16:50.233
THEY'LL COMMIT?

16:50.300 --> 16:53.166
OH, YEAH -- THE PRECOGS.

16:53.233 --> 16:53.766
THEY ARE BALD FREAKS WHO SLEEP

16:53.833 --> 16:54.833
IN AN INDOOR SWIMMING POOL AND

16:54.900 --> 16:55.666
THEY SCREAM WHEN THEY VISUALIZE

16:55.733 --> 16:56.266
A FUTURE MURDER.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.066
I THINK THEY'RE ALL SIBLINGS?

16:57.133 --> 16:57.666
OR ALIENS?

16:57.733 --> 16:58.300
OR BABIES?

16:58.366 --> 16:59.700
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

16:59.766 --> 17:00.500
BUT BASICALLY, THE MURDER RATE

17:00.566 --> 17:01.533
IN THE CITY IS ZERO, ANDERTON'S

17:01.600 --> 17:02.366
DOING WELL, AND SO THE STATUS

17:02.433 --> 17:03.433
QUO REMAINS.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.266
ONE DAY, THE PRECOGS GENERATE

17:05.333 --> 17:06.366
A PREDICTION: JOHN ANDERTON WILL

17:06.433 --> 17:07.566
MURDER A MAN HE DOESN'T EVEN

17:07.633 --> 17:08.500
KNOW IN JUST 36 HOURS.

17:08.566 --> 17:09.900
BUT IT COULDN'T BE!

17:09.966 --> 17:12.200
THAT'S OUR HERO, ISN'T IT?

17:12.266 --> 17:13.633
SO HE STAGES AN ESCAPE, GETS AN

17:13.700 --> 17:15.166
EYE TRANSPLANT SO HE CAN'T BE

17:15.233 --> 17:16.433
DETECTED BY THE CITY'S EYE-BASED

17:16.500 --> 17:18.100
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, FINDS OUT

17:18.166 --> 17:19.266
HE'S BEING FRAMED, THEN FINDS

17:19.333 --> 17:20.600
OUT THAT MAX VON SYDOW -- OH

17:20.666 --> 17:21.966
YEAH, BY THE WAY, HE'S IN THIS,

17:22.033 --> 17:22.900
TOO -- IS GOING TO KILL

17:22.966 --> 17:24.266
ANDERTON, BUT DECIDES NOT TO,

17:24.333 --> 17:26.100
AND ANDERTON DOESN'T KILL THE

17:26.166 --> 17:27.633
PERSON HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING

17:27.700 --> 17:28.733
TO, DISPROVING THE VERY BASIS OF

17:28.800 --> 17:29.666
THE PRE-CRIME SYSTEM AND PROVING

17:29.733 --> 17:30.033
THAT PEOPLE DO!

17:30.100 --> 17:30.333
HAVE!

17:30.400 --> 17:31.000
FREE!

17:31.066 --> 17:32.366
CHOICE!

17:32.433 --> 17:33.666
SO, IN THE END, THEY SHUT DOWN

17:33.733 --> 17:34.600
THE PROGRAM AND SEND THE PRECOGS

17:34.666 --> 17:36.300
AWAY TO LIVE ON A FARM, BUT NOT

17:36.366 --> 17:38.533
THE DEATH KIND, WE ASSUME.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.833
ANYWAY, IT'S SCARY, BUT IT'S

17:39.900 --> 17:43.133
PRETTY GOOD.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.466
I'D SAY THREE STARS.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.366
BUT THE BIGGER POINT IS:

17:48.433 --> 17:49.333
PEOPLE IN XINJIANG

17:49.400 --> 17:50.700
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND THROWN IN

17:50.766 --> 17:51.566
CAMPS DESPITE HAVING COMMITTED

17:51.633 --> 17:52.466
NO CRIMES, WHICH IS CHILLING.

17:52.533 --> 17:53.300
A MILLION UIGHURS WERE,

17:53.366 --> 17:54.633
AT ONE POINT, BEING HELD

17:54.700 --> 17:55.600
EXTRAJUDICIALLY -- MANY FOR ACTS

17:55.666 --> 17:57.566
AS INNOCUOUS AS GROWING A BEARD,

17:57.633 --> 17:58.400
FASTING, OR APPLYING

17:58.466 --> 18:00.066
FOR A PASSPORT.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.600
AND THIS IS A VERY SORE SUBJECT

18:01.666 --> 18:03.233
FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT,

18:03.300 --> 18:05.200
WHICH INITIALLY DENIED THE

18:05.266 --> 18:06.300
EXISTENCE OF THE CAMPS AT ALL,

18:06.366 --> 18:08.966
BEFORE SHIFTING TO ARGUING

18:09.033 --> 18:10.166
THAT THEY'RE MERELY VOCATIONAL

18:10.233 --> 18:10.833
TRAINING FACILITIES.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.500
ALTHOUGH EVEN THE

18:12.566 --> 18:14.500
HEAVILY-ORCHESTRATED MEDIA TOURS

18:14.566 --> 18:15.800
SUGGEST THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE

18:15.866 --> 18:16.966
MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.433
>> AUTHORITIES RECENTLY TOOK

18:18.500 --> 18:20.400
SOME DIPLOMATS AND JOURNALISTS

18:20.466 --> 18:21.833
ON A CAREFULLY SUPERVISED TOUR

18:21.900 --> 18:24.566
OF SOME OF THESE FACILITIES.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.466
SOME DETAINEES TOLD

18:26.533 --> 18:27.633
JOURNALISTS THE CAMPS REEDUCATE

18:27.700 --> 18:30.266
THEM.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.633
>> ALL OF US FOUND THAT WE HAVE

18:31.700 --> 18:33.233
SOMETHING WRONG WITH OURSELVES.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.666
AND LUCKILY ENOUGH, THE

18:34.733 --> 18:36.100
COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE

18:36.166 --> 18:37.033
GOVERNMENT OFFER THIS KIND OF

18:37.100 --> 18:39.033
SCHOOL TO US FOR FREE.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.500
>> IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW

18:40.566 --> 18:42.133
IT, SAY "YES, SIR!"

18:42.200 --> 18:44.033
IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT,

18:44.100 --> 18:45.800
SAY "YES, SIR!"

18:45.866 --> 18:48.466
"YES, SIR!"

18:48.533 --> 18:51.600
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

18:51.666 --> 18:53.433
THAT MIGHT BE THE SINGLE

18:53.500 --> 18:55.266
CREEPIEST SING-A-LONG I'VE EVER

18:55.333 --> 18:56.833
HEARD THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE

18:56.900 --> 18:58.633
BARNEY, A DINOSAUR WHO'S CLEARLY

18:58.700 --> 19:00.600
AWARE OF CLOTHING -- HE'S

19:00.666 --> 19:03.900
WEARING A HAT -- AND YET STILL

19:03.966 --> 19:05.533
ACTIVELY CHOOSES TO GO

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
BOTTOMLESS AROUND CHILDREN.

19:08.666 --> 19:09.400
YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER.

19:09.466 --> 19:10.166
AND FOR ALL THE CHINESE

19:10.233 --> 19:11.033
GOVERNMENT'S TALK OF

19:11.100 --> 19:12.066
"VOCATIONAL TRAINING," THESE

19:12.133 --> 19:13.033
CAMPS SURE SEEM PRISON-LIKE.

19:13.100 --> 19:13.966
LEAKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

19:14.033 --> 19:15.000
HAVE SHOWN THAT STAFF AT THESE

19:15.066 --> 19:16.100
FACILITIES WERE TOLD TO PREVENT

19:16.166 --> 19:17.266
STUDENTS FROM FREELY CONTACTING

19:17.333 --> 19:18.666
THE OUTSIDE WORLD, AND THAT THEY

19:18.733 --> 19:19.666
SHOULD "STRICTLY MANAGE AND

19:19.733 --> 19:20.866
CONTROL STUDENT ACTIVITIES TO

19:20.933 --> 19:23.000
PREVENT ESCAPES."

19:23.066 --> 19:24.900
AND THE PHRASE "PREVENT ESCAPES"

19:24.966 --> 19:27.533
IS SOMETHING OF A TELL.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.700
IF YOUR EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK SAYS

19:29.766 --> 19:30.866
"PREVENT ESCAPE," YOU'RE

19:30.933 --> 19:31.766
PROBABLY WORKING AT A PRISON,

19:31.833 --> 19:32.800
OR AT THE VERY LEAST,

19:32.866 --> 19:34.000
A SCIENTOLOGY PICNIC.

19:34.066 --> 19:35.900
"HEY, WE'RE JUST HERE TO GRILL

19:35.966 --> 19:38.833
SOME DOGS, PLAY SOME TUNES, AND

19:38.900 --> 19:40.766
IF ANYONE ASKS WHERE SHELLY IS,

19:40.833 --> 19:45.033
DO NOT LET THEM ESCAPE."

19:45.100 --> 19:45.900
AND IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH TO

19:45.966 --> 19:47.166
MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT THESE CAMPS

19:47.233 --> 19:48.166
REALLY ARE, JUST LISTEN TO ONE

19:48.233 --> 19:48.766
FORMER DETAINEE DESCRIBE WHAT

19:48.833 --> 19:50.233
SHE WENT THROUGH.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.000
>> EACH WOMAN GETS TWO MINUTES

19:51.066 --> 19:56.200
TO GO TO THE TOILET.

19:56.266 --> 19:57.366
THEY TELL YOU TO BE

19:57.433 --> 19:59.000
"QUICK, QUICK, QUICK."

19:59.066 --> 20:00.533
IF YOU'RE NOT QUICK ENOUGH, THEY

20:00.600 --> 20:02.000
SHOCK YOU WITH AN ELECTRIC BATON

20:02.066 --> 20:03.700
ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

20:03.766 --> 20:06.600
IT REALLY HURT.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.900
AND THEY DID IT A LOT.

20:08.966 --> 20:11.500
EVEN AFTER BEING SHOCKED, WE

20:11.566 --> 20:12.166
HAD TO SAY, "THANK YOU, TEACHER.

20:12.233 --> 20:17.266
WE WILL NOT BE LATE NEXT TIME."

20:17.333 --> 20:18.800
>> John: THAT IS CLEARLY

20:18.866 --> 20:19.400
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

20:19.466 --> 20:20.333
I DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE HAD TO

20:20.400 --> 20:21.466
PUBLICLY THANK ABUSERS ANYMORE

20:21.533 --> 20:22.233
NOW THAT HARVEY WEINSTEIN

20:22.300 --> 20:23.533
DOESN'T GO TO AWARD SHOWS.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.133
AND I'M NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

20:27.200 --> 20:27.966
THE REPORTS OF FORCED ABORTIONS

20:28.033 --> 20:28.566
AND STERILIZATIONS OF UIGHUR

20:28.633 --> 20:29.366
WOMEN, WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY

20:29.433 --> 20:30.566
HORRIFIC.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.366
AND CHINA WILL ARGUE THAT THIS

20:32.433 --> 20:33.533
IS ALL ABOUT ECONOMIC

20:33.600 --> 20:34.833
OPPORTUNITY AND ATTEMPTING TO

20:34.900 --> 20:36.333
ASSIMILATE A HISTORICALLY

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
OSTRACIZED MINORITY.

20:37.466 --> 20:39.100
BUT ASSIMILATION, WHEN FORCED,

20:39.166 --> 20:42.166
IS CULTURAL ERASURE.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.266
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO USING

20:44.333 --> 20:45.833
MASS DETENTION TO KEEP FAMILIES

20:45.900 --> 20:47.266
APART, THERE ARE ALSO RULES THAT

20:47.333 --> 20:48.400
SEEM TO BE TRYING TO BREAK

20:48.466 --> 20:49.766
THE CHAIN BY WHICH FAMILIES HAND

20:49.833 --> 20:53.933
DOWN A CULTURE AND FAITH ACROSS

20:54.000 --> 20:55.533
GENERATIONS -- FROM LAWS BAN ON

20:55.600 --> 20:56.700
BABY NAMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED

20:56.766 --> 20:58.166
TOO ISLAMIC TO THE CREATION OF

20:58.233 --> 20:59.200
STATE-RUN BOARDING SCHOOLS FOR

20:59.266 --> 21:01.066
UIGHUR CHILDREN.

21:01.133 --> 21:03.166
OTHER MOVES BY CHINA HAVE BEEN

21:03.233 --> 21:04.433
EVEN MORE ON-THE-NOSE,

21:04.500 --> 21:05.366
LIKE THE DESTRUCTION OF

21:05.433 --> 21:09.266
UIGHUR CEMETERIES.

21:09.333 --> 21:09.900
THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY TURNED

21:09.966 --> 21:11.033
AN ENORMOUS GRAVEYARD WHERE A

21:11.100 --> 21:11.833
PROMINENT UIGHUR POET WAS BURIED

21:11.900 --> 21:13.666
INTO SOMETHING CALLED

21:13.733 --> 21:15.066
"HAPPINESS PARK," COMPLETE WITH

21:15.133 --> 21:16.433
FAKE PANDAS, CHILDREN'S RIDES,

21:16.500 --> 21:20.266
AND A MAN-MADE LAKE.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.466
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS

21:21.533 --> 21:22.333
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.300
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE PANDAS

21:23.366 --> 21:24.633
IN QUESTION.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
AND FRANKLY, I HAVE NEVER HAD

21:25.766 --> 21:27.900
MORE QUESTIONS.

21:27.966 --> 21:29.666
WHY IS HE HOLDING A LOLLIPOP?

21:29.733 --> 21:31.533
WHY DOES HE HAVE THE POSTURE OF

21:31.600 --> 21:32.900
A STARTLED GOPHER?

21:32.966 --> 21:34.366
WHY DOES HE HAVE AN EXPRESSION

21:34.433 --> 21:35.500
THAT SCREAMS, "I JUST HAD A

21:35.566 --> 21:36.566
LOBOTOMY, BUT IT TURNS OUT,

21:36.633 --> 21:38.366
I'M BOTH HAPPY ABOUT IT, AND

21:38.433 --> 21:42.300
SURPRISINGLY HORNY?"

21:42.366 --> 21:43.200
FRUSTRATINGLY, WE MAY NEVER KNOW

21:43.266 --> 21:44.266
THE ANSWERS!

21:44.333 --> 21:45.100
NOW, THANKFULLY, AS CRITICISM OF

21:45.166 --> 21:46.100
CHINA'S CAMPS HAS INTENSIFIED

21:46.166 --> 21:47.066
IN RECENT YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT

21:47.133 --> 21:47.733
SEEMS TO BE CLOSING SOME OF

21:47.800 --> 21:51.100
THEM.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.800
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THEY SEEM

21:52.866 --> 21:54.300
TO HAVE SHIFTED TO STAGING SHAM

21:54.366 --> 21:55.566
TRIALS AND TRANSFERRING MANY

21:55.633 --> 21:57.066
UIGHURS TO PRISONS THAT AREN'T

21:57.133 --> 21:57.833
EVEN PRETENDING TO BE "TRAINING

21:57.900 --> 21:58.700
CENTERS" ANYMORE.

21:58.766 --> 21:59.866
CHINA'S ALSO CREATED A SYSTEM OF

21:59.933 --> 22:01.133
MASS LABOR TRANSFERS THAT SENDS

22:01.200 --> 22:02.600
UIGHURS AND OTHER ETHNIC

22:02.666 --> 22:04.300
MINORITIES INTO FACTORY AND

22:04.366 --> 22:05.800
SERVICE JOBS, SOMETIMES HUNDREDS

22:05.866 --> 22:08.033
OR THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HOME.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.833
THAT IS HOW THOSE MASKS THAT

22:09.900 --> 22:11.233
WE MENTIONED AT THE START OF

22:11.300 --> 22:13.000
THIS PIECE ARE GETTING MADE.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.933
AND CHINESE STATE MEDIA PRESENTS

22:15.033 --> 22:16.833
THIS AS A POSITIVE, SHOWING

22:16.900 --> 22:18.366
UIGHUR WORKERS ARRIVING AT A

22:18.433 --> 22:20.233
TRAIN STATION, THEN BEING TAKEN

22:20.300 --> 22:21.666
ON A BUS TO THEIR NEW

22:21.733 --> 22:24.000
ACCOMMODATIONS, ALL WITH

22:24.066 --> 22:25.866
UPBEAT NARRATION LIKE THIS.

22:25.933 --> 22:29.133
>> UP TO NOW, XINJIANG HAS

22:29.200 --> 22:30.766
ORGANIZED TRANSFERS FOR AROUND

22:30.833 --> 22:32.533
178,000 WORKERS, PROVIDING THEM

22:32.600 --> 22:34.033
A STABLE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF OVER

22:34.100 --> 22:35.866
92%.

22:35.933 --> 22:37.700
>> John: YEAH, YOU CAN'T

22:37.766 --> 22:41.566
CELEBRATE A STABLE WORKFORCE

22:41.633 --> 22:42.600
WHEN IT IS FORCED LABOR

22:42.666 --> 22:44.000
ANYMORE THAN YOU CAN GIVE ME

22:44.066 --> 22:44.666
CREDIT FOR "SPENDING A LOT OF

22:44.733 --> 22:45.300
TIME WITH MY KIDS OVER THE PAST

22:45.366 --> 22:45.933
FEW MONTHS."

22:46.000 --> 22:46.766
BELIEVE ME, IF I HAD ANY OTHER

22:46.833 --> 22:48.033
CHOICE, I WOULDN'T BE.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.200
BECAUSE, AS YOU'VE PROBABLY

22:49.266 --> 22:50.366
GUESSED, THIS ISN'T JUST

22:50.433 --> 22:51.200
A BENEVOLENT JOBS PROGRAM.

22:51.266 --> 22:52.833
THE IDEA, AS ONE LOCAL

22:52.900 --> 22:54.566
GOVERNMENT REPORT PUT IT, IS

22:54.633 --> 22:55.733
THAT SENDING UIGHURS FAR FROM

22:55.800 --> 22:57.100
HOME WILL ALLOW FOR "DISTANCING

22:57.166 --> 22:58.466
THEM FROM RELIGIOUSLY EXTREME

22:58.533 --> 22:59.733
VIEWS AND EDUCATING THEM."

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

23:00.866 --> 23:02.600
DISTANCED.

23:02.666 --> 23:04.233
ONE AUSTRALIAN THINK TANK THAT

23:04.300 --> 23:05.200
INVESTIGATED FORCED LABOR

23:05.266 --> 23:08.233
ESTIMATED THAT, CONSERVATIVELY,

23:08.300 --> 23:09.533
OVER JUST A TWO-YEAR PERIOD,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.600
"MORE THAN 80,000 UIGHURS WERE

23:11.666 --> 23:13.066
TRANSFERRED OUT OF XINJIANG TO

23:13.133 --> 23:14.833
WORK IN FACTORIES ACROSS CHINA."

23:14.900 --> 23:16.766
THEY ALSO FOUND OVER

23:16.833 --> 23:18.233
80 COMPANIES DIRECTLY OR

23:18.300 --> 23:19.466
INDIRECTLY BENEFITING FROM

23:19.533 --> 23:21.100
UIGHUR LABOR IN THEIR SUPPLY

23:21.166 --> 23:22.366
CHAINS, SOME OF THEM BIG

23:22.433 --> 23:27.700
INTERNATIONAL BRANDS LIKE NIKE.

23:27.766 --> 23:29.333
WHEN "THE WASHINGTON POST"

23:29.400 --> 23:30.766
VISITED THE FACTORY OF ONE OF

23:30.833 --> 23:32.166
NIKE'S SUPPLIERS, IT FOUND

23:32.233 --> 23:33.366
UIGHUR WORKERS WERE FORCED TO

23:33.433 --> 23:35.100
ATTEND PATRIOTIC EDUCATION AND

23:35.166 --> 23:36.100
MANDARIN CLASSES AND LIVE IN

23:36.166 --> 23:36.666
DORMITORIES UNDER CONSTANT

23:36.733 --> 23:37.466
SUPERVISION, WITH

23:37.533 --> 23:38.566
ONE WORKER SAYING, "WE CAN WALK

23:38.633 --> 23:39.366
AROUND, BUT WE CAN'T GO BACK TO

23:39.433 --> 23:43.433
XINJIANG ON OUR OWN."

23:43.500 --> 23:44.266
NIKE HAS CLAIMED THAT THIS

23:44.333 --> 23:46.833
FACTORY NO LONGER EMPLOYEES

23:46.900 --> 23:48.233
UIGHUR WORKERS AND THEY TOLD US

23:48.300 --> 23:50.300
THAT THEY TAKE ANY REPORTS ABOUT

23:50.366 --> 23:50.766
FORCED LABOR SERIOUSLY

23:50.833 --> 23:51.733
AND THAT THEY'RE

23:51.800 --> 23:52.466
"CONDUCTING ONGOING DILIGENCE

23:52.533 --> 23:53.433
WITH OUR SUPPLIERS IN CHINA."

23:53.500 --> 23:54.600
WHICH, GIVEN WHAT "THE POST"

23:54.666 --> 23:55.566
FOUND, FEELS LIKE THEIR POLICY

23:55.633 --> 23:56.566
ON OVERSIGHT IS LESS

23:56.633 --> 23:57.766
"JUST DO IT" THAN "JUST TALK

23:57.833 --> 23:58.866
ABOUT DOING IT AND HOPE PEOPLE

23:58.933 --> 24:01.533
EVENTUALLY STOP ASKING."

24:01.600 --> 24:02.433
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST NIKE.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.666
ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE LIST IS

24:03.733 --> 24:05.233
VOLKSWAGEN, WHICH TOLD US THEY

24:05.300 --> 24:06.400
FOUND "NO INDICATIONS" OF FORCED

24:06.466 --> 24:10.333
LABOR IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN,

24:10.400 --> 24:11.100
THOUGH IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT

24:11.166 --> 24:11.866
LAST YEAR, THEIR CEO WAS

24:11.933 --> 24:13.200
CHALLENGED ABOUT WHETHER CHINA'S

24:13.266 --> 24:14.700
TREATMENT OF THE UIGHURS GAVE

24:14.766 --> 24:15.766
HIM PAUSE, AND THIS WAS HIS

24:15.833 --> 24:16.566
RESPONSE.

24:16.633 --> 24:18.000
>> I'M -- WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

24:18.066 --> 24:20.533
PROUD TO ALSO CREATE WORKPLACES

24:20.600 --> 24:21.266
IN THAT REGION, WHICH WE THINK

24:21.333 --> 24:22.766
IS VERY USEFUL.

24:22.833 --> 24:23.866
>> BUT XINJIANG IS SOMETHING

24:23.933 --> 24:24.933
YOU'RE NOT PROUD TO BE

24:25.000 --> 24:27.400
ASSOCIATED WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT

24:27.466 --> 24:28.200
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS DOING

24:28.266 --> 24:29.533
TO UIGHUR PEOPLE AND --

24:29.600 --> 24:30.733
>> I CAN'T JUDGE THIS, SORRY.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.266
>> YOU CAN'T JUDGE IT?

24:31.333 --> 24:31.800
>> NO.

24:31.866 --> 24:33.766
>> BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

24:33.833 --> 24:34.333
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- WHAT

24:34.400 --> 24:35.533
YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.000
>> YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHINA'S

24:37.066 --> 24:39.800
RE-EDUCATION CAMPS FOR A MILLION

24:39.866 --> 24:43.933
UIGHUR PEOPLE, THAT IS, IT HAS

24:44.000 --> 24:44.633
REFERRED TO AS RE-EDUCATION

24:44.700 --> 24:45.900
CAMPS AS PART OF HIS

24:45.966 --> 24:46.533
COUNTER-TERROR THREAT

24:46.600 --> 24:48.333
IN THE WEST OF HIS COUNTRY,

24:48.400 --> 24:48.866
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT?

24:48.933 --> 24:49.733
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.266
>> John: WOW.

24:51.333 --> 24:52.533
FINDING OUT THAT VOLKSWAGEN

24:52.600 --> 24:53.633
IS OVERLOOKING A MASSIVE HUMAN

24:53.700 --> 24:54.800
RIGHTS CRISIS IS A LOT LIKE

24:54.866 --> 24:55.600
FINDING OUT THAT YOUR

24:55.666 --> 24:58.100
GRANDPARENTS ARE STILL HAVING

24:58.166 --> 24:59.100
SEX: SURE, IT'S HORRIFYING,

24:59.166 --> 25:03.033
BUT IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE TOO

25:03.100 --> 25:03.933
SHOCKING, AFTER ALL,

25:04.000 --> 25:04.633
THEY'VE BEEN DOING

25:04.700 --> 25:05.666
IT SINCE WORLD WAR TWO!

25:05.733 --> 25:06.900
AND LOOK, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

25:06.966 --> 25:07.833
COMPANIES -- AND OTHERS -- MIGHT

25:07.900 --> 25:09.733
WANT TO TURN AWAY FROM WHAT'S

25:09.800 --> 25:10.666
GOING ON IN XINJIANG, BECAUSE

25:10.733 --> 25:12.000
IT'S HARROWING.

25:12.066 --> 25:13.266
REMEMBER THAT WOMAN WHO GOT

25:13.333 --> 25:14.233
ELECTRIC SHOCKS FOR TAKING TOO

25:14.300 --> 25:15.666
LONG IN THE BATHROOM?

25:15.733 --> 25:17.866
SHE WAS IN TWO DIFFERENT CAMPS,

25:17.933 --> 25:18.800
THEN WAS TRANSFERRED INTO FORCED

25:18.866 --> 25:20.300
LABOR AT A GLOVE FACTORY, ALL

25:20.366 --> 25:21.700
WHILE SEPARATED FROM HER FAMILY

25:21.766 --> 25:22.766
FOR TWO YEARS.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.766
AND WHILE THEY WERE EVENTUALLY

25:24.833 --> 25:26.733
REUNITED, THEY'RE UNDERSTANDABLY

25:26.800 --> 25:27.733
STILL HAUNTED TO THIS DAY.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.400
>> FOR TWO YEARS, YOU DIDN'T SEE

25:28.466 --> 25:39.966
YOUR MOM?

25:40.033 --> 25:41.100
>> I MISSED MY MOMMY.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.266
DON'T CRY, MOMMY.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.033
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.966
DON'T CRY, MOMMY.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.766
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHOW YOUR

25:47.833 --> 25:52.400
TEARS.

25:52.466 --> 25:54.200
>> John: THAT IS HEARTBREAKING

25:54.266 --> 25:55.533
AND COMPLETELY INDEFENSIBLE.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.633
AND WHENEVER PRESSED, THE

25:56.700 --> 25:57.600
CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

25:57.666 --> 25:58.500
QUICK TO USE WHATABOUTISM.

25:58.566 --> 26:00.000
THEY RESPONDED TO U.S. CRITICISM

26:00.066 --> 26:01.266
BY INVOKING ATROCITIES RANGING

26:01.333 --> 26:03.833
FROM THE GENOCIDE OF

26:03.900 --> 26:05.900
NATIVE AMERICANS TO A STATEMENT

26:05.966 --> 26:07.066
THAT "GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH SHOWS

26:07.133 --> 26:08.666
THAT U.S. SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS

26:08.733 --> 26:09.733
CHOKED ETHNIC MINORITIES SO HARD

26:09.800 --> 26:11.833
THAT THEY "CAN'T BREATHE."

26:11.900 --> 26:17.033
AND LOOK, THOSE ARE FAIR HITS,

26:17.100 --> 26:18.300
THOSE ARE FAIR POINTS RIGHT

26:18.366 --> 26:18.766
THERE,

26:18.833 --> 26:19.933
BUT IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY

26:20.000 --> 26:20.833
POSSIBLE FOR TWO THINGS TO BE

26:20.900 --> 26:21.766
WRONG AT THE SAME TIME.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.266
AND I KNOW THE U.S.-CHINA

26:23.333 --> 26:24.133
RELATIONSHIP IS COMPLICATED --

26:24.200 --> 26:25.800
PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW -- AND

26:25.866 --> 26:26.700
TOO OFTEN, IT DESCENDS INTO

26:26.766 --> 26:31.900
REDUCTIVE, XENOPHOBIC

26:31.966 --> 26:33.166
US VERSUS THEM STEREOTYPES.

26:33.233 --> 26:34.500
BUT HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD BE

26:34.566 --> 26:35.333
COMPLETELY NON-NEGOTIABLE.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.833
AND I WILL SAY, THE U.S. HAS

26:36.900 --> 26:42.200
TAKEN SOME SMALL STEPS HERE,

26:42.266 --> 26:43.733
LIKE IMPOSING SANCTIONS AGAINST

26:43.800 --> 26:44.333
TOP CHINESE OFFICIALS,

26:44.400 --> 26:45.366
AND CONGRESS EVEN

26:45.433 --> 26:46.533
PASSED THE UIGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS

26:46.600 --> 26:47.500
POLICY ACT EARLIER THIS YEAR.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.300
BUT ALTHOUGH TRUMP SIGNED IT, HE

26:49.366 --> 26:50.433
THAT HE SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH

26:50.500 --> 26:51.066
BUILDING THE CAMPS, BECAUSE

26:51.133 --> 26:51.933
HE THOUGHT IT WAS "EXACTLY THE

26:52.000 --> 26:52.933
RIGHT THING TO DO."

26:53.000 --> 26:54.300
WHICH, FROM A FOREIGN POLICY

26:54.366 --> 26:55.800
PERSPECTIVE, A HUMAN RIGHTS

26:55.866 --> 26:56.866
PERSPECTIVE, A POLITICAL

26:56.933 --> 26:58.333
PERSPECTIVE, AND AN

26:58.400 --> 26:59.433
INTERPERSONAL PERSPECTIVE,

26:59.500 --> 27:01.233
IS EXACTLY THE WRONG FUCKING

27:01.300 --> 27:03.933
THING TO DO.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.300
BUT LOOK, THIS CLEARLY ISN'T

27:05.366 --> 27:08.400
JUST ABOUT TRUMP.

27:08.466 --> 27:09.166
IS IT?

27:09.233 --> 27:10.266
GOING FORWARD, THE ENTIRE GLOBAL

27:10.333 --> 27:11.300
COMMUNITY NEEDS TO DO MORE.

27:11.366 --> 27:12.300
THE U.N. SHOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT

27:12.366 --> 27:13.300
INVESTIGATORS LOOKING INTO WHAT

27:13.366 --> 27:14.666
CHINA HAS DONE IN XINJIANG.

27:14.733 --> 27:21.000
GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD

27:21.066 --> 27:22.933
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE TREATMENT

27:23.000 --> 27:24.400
OF UIGHURS WITHOUT BENDING TO

27:24.466 --> 27:24.833
CHINESE INFLUENCE.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.033
AND BIG MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES,

27:26.100 --> 27:26.766
LIKE NIKE AND VW, SHOULD NOT

27:26.833 --> 27:27.800
ONLY BE WORKING TO CLEAN UP

27:27.866 --> 27:28.600
THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS, BUT ALSO

27:28.666 --> 27:29.566
ACTIVELY USING THEIR FINANCIAL

27:29.633 --> 27:30.700
LEVERAGE TO PRESSURE THE CHINESE

27:30.766 --> 27:32.333
GOVERNMENT TO END THESE ABUSES,

27:32.400 --> 27:33.666
BUT NONE OF THAT'S GOING TO

27:33.733 --> 27:34.300
HAPPEN UNLESS PEOPLE PAY

27:34.366 --> 27:35.333
ATTENTION.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.666
AND LOOK, I KNOW THAT "RAISING

27:36.733 --> 27:38.500
AWARENESS" IS OFTEN A BULLSHIT

27:38.566 --> 27:40.266
SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T REALLY

27:40.333 --> 27:41.266
SOLVE A PROBLEM.

27:41.333 --> 27:43.133
BUT THERE CAN BE A REAL BENEFIT

27:43.200 --> 27:43.966
TO AWARENESS, EVEN IF IT'S

27:44.033 --> 27:46.466
COMING THROUGH A TIKTOK MAKEUP

27:46.533 --> 27:48.133
TUTORIAL, OR, LET'S SAY,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.000
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF ONE.

27:50.066 --> 27:52.233
BECAUSE IN THIS INSTANCE,

27:52.300 --> 27:53.666
AWARENESS IS ACTUALLY A

27:53.733 --> 27:54.766
NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR

27:54.833 --> 27:56.166
ACTION.

27:56.233 --> 27:56.933
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO

27:57.000 --> 27:58.233
WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW,

27:58.300 --> 27:59.566
FROM A RAGING PANDEMIC TO AN

27:59.633 --> 28:01.733
UGLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,

28:01.800 --> 28:03.266
TO A PURPLE PERVERT WHO COULDN'T

28:03.333 --> 28:05.100
GIVE A FUCK ABOUT PANTS.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.500
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

28:06.566 --> 28:07.466
THE TREATMENT OF UIGHURS IS ALSO

28:07.533 --> 28:08.766
ON THAT LIST.

28:08.833 --> 28:11.233
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

28:11.300 --> 28:13.100
A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN CENTERED ON

28:13.166 --> 28:14.866
CULTURAL ERASURE, ONE OF THE

28:14.933 --> 28:16.266
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO

28:16.333 --> 28:18.200
IS CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION,

28:18.266 --> 28:19.966
AT THE VERY LEAST SO THAT IF

28:20.033 --> 28:21.233
AN ENTIRE CULTURE IS REPLACED BY

28:21.300 --> 28:22.633
A HORNY LOBOTOMIZED PANDA,

28:22.700 --> 28:24.333
WE'LL KNOW TO FUCKING SAY
