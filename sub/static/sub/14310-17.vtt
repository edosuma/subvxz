WEBVTT

00:01.179 --> 00:03.009
[theme music]

00:05.080 --> 00:08.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.089 --> 00:15.080
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.050
They were good.

00:17.070 --> 00:19.010
[music continues]

00:22.079 --> 00:26.089
Then there was Gargamel
the evil wizard.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.089
Ooh! I hate Smurfs!

00:31.120 --> 00:33.229
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.009 --> 00:36.060
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.060
[evil laugh]

00:38.079 --> 00:39.149
[Gargamel grunts]

00:39.170 --> 00:41.109
Oh! I'll get you.

00:41.130 --> 00:44.219
'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:45.000 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may here Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.229
And if you are good,
you may just

00:54.009 --> 00:56.200
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.210
[theme music]

01:05.209 --> 01:07.209
[snoring]

01:09.189 --> 01:13.230
Lazy Smurf, there's more to life
than sleeping.

01:14.010 --> 01:15.079
Up, up!

01:15.099 --> 01:17.049
The early bird
catches the worm

01:17.069 --> 01:21.030
and a rolling stone
gathers no moss.

01:21.049 --> 01:23.030
[instrumental music]

01:25.019 --> 01:26.150
thump

01:26.170 --> 01:28.140
I get no respect.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.229
You should cheer up,
Grouchy Smurf

01:33.009 --> 01:34.229
and live each day
to the fullest.

01:35.009 --> 01:37.069
Don't dwell
on the negative side of..

01:37.090 --> 01:39.069
[stammers]

01:42.049 --> 01:43.159
- Boo!
- Ah!

01:43.180 --> 01:46.000
[laughs]

01:46.020 --> 01:48.009
Now, listen to me, Jokey Smurf.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.030
There's a time and a place for..

01:50.049 --> 01:51.120
[laughs]

01:51.140 --> 01:53.200
It's a surprise.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.079
[laughs]

01:55.099 --> 01:58.099
Why, thank you.
At least some smurf..

01:59.030 --> 02:01.010
...respects me.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.219
[instrumental music]

02:05.000 --> 02:08.189
Look at all you Smurfs sitting
around like bumps on a log.

02:08.210 --> 02:10.158
Why, if Papa Smurf
ever found out

02:10.180 --> 02:12.120
he would be
disappointed that you..

02:12.139 --> 02:14.080
'Wait, I'm not finished yet.'

02:14.099 --> 02:17.020
You've been finished
for years, Brainy.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.120
bam bam bam

02:21.139 --> 02:22.189
Hefty.

02:23.229 --> 02:26.150
Um, I was just going to say
that, uh..

02:26.170 --> 02:29.099
Well, the mind also
needs exercise

02:29.120 --> 02:32.030
'and I strongly suggest that..'

02:34.069 --> 02:35.210
thud

02:35.229 --> 02:37.060
splash

02:40.120 --> 02:43.079
When the only thing
Smurfs respect is brawn

02:43.099 --> 02:47.229
it's-it's tough being the brains
of the outfit.

02:48.189 --> 02:49.229
thud

02:52.139 --> 02:55.099
There must be a way to earn
the other Smurfs' respect.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.039
I just know I'll smurf up
something brilliant.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.099
After all, among all the Smurfs,
my mind is the sharpest

03:01.120 --> 03:03.139
keenest and most alert.

03:03.159 --> 03:05.199
[Big Mouth groans]

03:05.219 --> 03:07.080
Who that?

03:07.099 --> 03:11.069
B-B-Big Mouth. Help!

03:11.090 --> 03:14.020
Help! Help! Big Mouth!

03:14.039 --> 03:16.020
Maybe Smurfs have goodies

03:16.039 --> 03:18.219
to fill Big Mouth's
empty stomach.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.079
(Brainy)
'Big Mouth is coming.'

03:20.099 --> 03:23.170
'Big Mouth is coming.
Big Mouth is coming!'

03:24.110 --> 03:25.139
[Smurfs gasp]

03:25.159 --> 03:28.030
[all yelling]

03:28.050 --> 03:32.120
[sniffs]
Big Mouth smell goodies.

03:33.199 --> 03:36.150
Mmm. Big Mouth see goodies.

03:36.170 --> 03:39.050
Big Mouth take goodies.

03:39.069 --> 03:42.139
Mr. Big Mouth, that's our
winter supply of food.

03:42.159 --> 03:44.090
I order you to put it back.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.030
[gulps]

03:46.050 --> 03:48.199
On second thought,
help yourself.

03:48.219 --> 03:51.020
Oh, that nasty old Big Mouth.

03:51.039 --> 03:54.039
He took all of our stores.
He should be ashamed.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.229
Yes, the first snow
is due any day

03:57.009 --> 03:58.170
'and if we don't restock
immediately'

03:58.189 --> 04:02.030
we're going to go hungry
this winter.

04:02.050 --> 04:04.090
This is all your fault,
Brainy Smurf.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.110
You led Big Mouth
to the village.

04:06.129 --> 04:10.009
Now, no Smurf
will ever respect me.

04:10.030 --> 04:13.039
Unless I could
become real strong

04:13.060 --> 04:16.129
and somehow get
the food back from Big Mouth.

04:16.149 --> 04:21.079
I'll show them Brainy Smurf
has brawn as well as brain.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.230
[instrumental music]

04:33.060 --> 04:35.009
[panting]

04:37.019 --> 04:41.029
This is gonna take more
exercise than I can take.

04:41.050 --> 04:43.230
Hmm, I need to do this fast.

04:44.009 --> 04:46.029
Papa Smurf's magic books.

04:46.050 --> 04:49.180
I bet one of them has a formula
for making me strong.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.050
[crickets chirping]

04:54.029 --> 04:56.159
[instrumental music]

05:02.009 --> 05:06.029
Nothing. I've been through
all Papa Smurf's books.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.069
Except one.

05:09.089 --> 05:11.069
Ah, "Strength Formulas."

05:11.089 --> 05:14.060
There's gotta be one in here.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.000
"Strong, stronger,
super strong!"

05:17.019 --> 05:20.050
Hmm. "This formula guarantees
the user a super strength

05:20.069 --> 05:23.029
far beyond that of
normal beings."

05:23.050 --> 05:25.170
This is it!

05:25.189 --> 05:28.180
The tenth try.
It-it's just gotta work.

05:31.170 --> 05:33.100
boom

05:33.120 --> 05:35.220
[grunting]

05:36.000 --> 05:37.079
[panting]

05:37.100 --> 05:41.079
Oh, what's the use?
I'll never be strong.

05:45.029 --> 05:46.069
thud

05:46.090 --> 05:47.139
Huh?

05:47.159 --> 05:50.050
[instrumental music]

05:51.079 --> 05:53.170
'It worked. It worked!'

05:56.050 --> 05:58.180
[scoffs]
Now, I'll get our food back
from Big Mouth

05:58.199 --> 06:00.209
and show all these Smurfs.

06:03.110 --> 06:05.220
Ooh, what's it say,
Papa Smurf?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.069
"Dear, Papa Smurf.

06:07.089 --> 06:10.019
"I'm going to get our food back
from Big Mouth.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.129
Signed, Brainy Supersmurf?"

06:13.149 --> 06:15.079
(all)
Supersmurf?

06:17.149 --> 06:18.199
[both grunting]

06:18.220 --> 06:21.079
Hmm. This doesn't look good.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.050
What, Papa Smurf?

06:23.069 --> 06:25.000
Brainy used a potion
from this book

06:25.019 --> 06:26.110
that gave him
super strength.

06:26.129 --> 06:30.029
But he doesn't know
it lasts for only two hours.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.000
And he's going after
Big Mouth.

06:32.019 --> 06:34.029
Oh, poor Brainy.

06:34.050 --> 06:36.060
Quickly, we have to stop him.

06:37.129 --> 06:39.180
[dramatic music]

06:39.199 --> 06:41.069
[grunts]

06:41.090 --> 06:43.110
There's more to this flying
than I thought.

06:43.129 --> 06:46.159
But nothing can hold down
Supersmurf.

06:47.069 --> 06:49.069
Now I'm really..

06:49.090 --> 06:50.129
bang

06:50.149 --> 06:51.220
...flying.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.180
[chirping]

06:58.029 --> 07:00.040
Ah!

07:00.060 --> 07:03.040
That must be
Big Mouth's house.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.040
Faster, my little Smurfs.
Faster, faster!

07:06.060 --> 07:08.040
[Big Mouth humming]

07:11.220 --> 07:15.040
- 'Hey, Big Mouth.'
- Who here?

07:16.100 --> 07:19.009
Hey. What Smurf want?

07:19.029 --> 07:22.079
Not Smurf. Supersmurf!

07:22.100 --> 07:25.019
Go away. Me eating.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.019
Quiet. This food belongs to the
Smurfs, and you can't have it.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.019
Papa Smurf always says that..

07:33.040 --> 07:37.090
Ha-ha! You've gotta be faster
than that, Big Mouth.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.209
[growling]

07:39.230 --> 07:42.060
Stand up and fight
like an ogre!

07:42.079 --> 07:44.199
Big Mouth
flatten Smurf like..

07:44.220 --> 07:47.100
[chuckles]
...yummy pancake.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.029
Not Smurf. Supersmurf!

07:50.050 --> 07:52.090
[panting]
I hope we're not too late.

07:52.110 --> 07:55.189
'Brainy won't stand a chance
against that ogre.'

07:55.209 --> 07:57.170
Supersmurf!

07:57.189 --> 08:00.000
[Big Mouth yells]

08:00.019 --> 08:02.050
Sweet dreams.

08:02.069 --> 08:06.069
Alright. Now, Big Mouth mad!

08:08.230 --> 08:11.149
- What's that?
- The end of Brainy?

08:11.170 --> 08:14.089
Quickly, follow me.

08:14.110 --> 08:17.050
(Smurfette)
Oh, boo-hoo. Poor Brainy.

08:17.069 --> 08:19.139
How will we ever save him,
Papa Smurf?

08:19.160 --> 08:22.019
I'm working on it, Smurfette.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.000
Look out!

08:24.019 --> 08:25.060
splat

08:27.100 --> 08:31.089
- 'Brainy did that?'
- Come on. We have to find him.

08:32.129 --> 08:34.009
(all)
Brainy!

08:34.029 --> 08:37.100
I did it, Papa Smurf.
I got all our food back.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.019
It's right here in this sack.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.090
Brainy, there's something
I have to tell you about--

08:42.110 --> 08:45.190
You should have seen me,
Papa Smurf.

08:45.210 --> 08:48.139
I was incredible. I was--

08:48.159 --> 08:51.179
Brainy, listen.
That strength formula is--

08:51.200 --> 08:55.019
Oh, Papa Smurf.
Here comes Big Mouth.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.059
(Greedy)
I say we take the food
and get out.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.190
Greedy's right.
We should get out of here.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.070
Oh, not yet, Papa Smurf.

09:02.090 --> 09:04.230
I've gotta teach
Big Mouth a lesson.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.220
(Papa Smurf)
'Brainy, you're losing
your strength.'

09:09.000 --> 09:11.200
[grunting]
No, I'm not, Papa Smurf.

09:11.220 --> 09:14.009
Really, I'm not,
I'm just as strong as..

09:14.029 --> 09:16.070
[groans]
...ever.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.220
[laughing]

09:20.000 --> 09:21.139
swoosh

09:21.159 --> 09:23.009
[all groaning]

09:23.029 --> 09:25.029
Well, heh-heh,
it could be worse.

09:25.049 --> 09:28.190
Winter's still a week away.
I know because..

09:28.210 --> 09:30.049
[thunder rumbling]

09:32.009 --> 09:35.129
Alright, alright, alright.
So we'll have an early winter.

09:37.110 --> 09:41.029
Papa Smurf, if I only had
more super-strength formula

09:41.049 --> 09:43.070
I'm absolutely sure
I could--

09:43.090 --> 09:45.200
(all)
Smurf up, Brainy.

09:45.220 --> 09:49.230
Brainy, that formula causes
more problems than it solves.

09:50.009 --> 09:52.120
Look! Big Mouth's
gonna eat our food.

09:52.139 --> 09:55.019
[humming]

09:56.169 --> 09:58.220
Not if I can help it.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.029
- Hi, big fella.
- Huh?

10:05.049 --> 10:09.059
- Ta-da, here I am.
- What Smurf want?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.120
Oh, you big silly.

10:11.139 --> 10:14.009
I'm not a Smurf,
I'm a Smurfette.

10:14.029 --> 10:16.129
Like what you see?

10:16.149 --> 10:19.070
- No.
- Oh, Mr. Big Mouth.

10:19.090 --> 10:24.019
If you only knew how very,
very much we blue little Smurfs

10:24.039 --> 10:26.080
need that food.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.159
Big Mouth needs food too.

10:28.179 --> 10:33.210
Oh, of course you do.
You're so big and strong.

10:33.230 --> 10:37.029
But think of all
the little starving Smurfs.

10:37.049 --> 10:40.009
Little starving Smurfs?

10:40.029 --> 10:44.029
Yeah. Teensy-weensy,
little blue Smurfs.

10:44.049 --> 10:46.049
Crying out in the cold,
dark night

10:46.070 --> 10:48.049
for food that isn't there.

10:48.070 --> 10:50.200
[sobbing]
Oh, boo-hoo!

10:50.220 --> 10:55.029
[sobbing]
That make Big Mouth sad.

10:55.049 --> 10:57.009
[crying]

10:57.029 --> 11:01.110
And you stole our food,
you bad boy.

11:01.129 --> 11:04.009
[wailing]
Yeah.

11:04.029 --> 11:07.039
You're a very naughty ogre,
aren't you?

11:07.059 --> 11:10.080
[wails]
Bad ogre.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.190
And you're gonna give us
all our food back, aren't you?

11:15.210 --> 11:16.230
[crying]

11:19.179 --> 11:22.149
- No.
- Help!

11:22.169 --> 11:25.019
- Hefty.
- I'll get her, Papa Smurf.

11:25.039 --> 11:28.019
Never mind, Hefty. I still
have some strength left.

11:28.039 --> 11:30.009
I wouldn't want you
to strain yourself, Brainy.

11:30.029 --> 11:32.080
- Don't worry, I won't.
- I'll catch her.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.000
Oh, Papa Smurf.

11:35.019 --> 11:37.029
Thank you. Mwah!

11:41.149 --> 11:43.190
Boy, am I hungry.

11:43.210 --> 11:46.039
And I'm cold.

11:46.059 --> 11:49.059
Oh, how will we ever
get our food back?

11:49.080 --> 11:52.049
- I don't know, Smurfette.
- Papa Smurf.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.100
I know how to get
our food back.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.169
(all)
You do?

11:55.190 --> 11:57.019
Let's hear it, Brainy.

11:57.039 --> 12:00.070
[whispering]

12:00.090 --> 12:03.120
Oh, guess
who coming to dinner.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.070
Me, me, me.

12:06.090 --> 12:09.169
Mmm. Mud soup good.

12:11.019 --> 12:13.110
[dramatic music]

12:17.190 --> 12:19.210
[humming]

12:21.120 --> 12:24.129
Huh? What rocks do in there?

12:27.029 --> 12:30.179
Big Mouth love rocks
dipped in slime.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.200
Mmm.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.059
[crunching]

12:34.080 --> 12:36.110
Rocks nice and crispy.

12:36.129 --> 12:38.080
[all laughing]

12:38.100 --> 12:43.200
[chuckling]
I have to admit, Brainy,
those rocks were a smurfy idea.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.120
Oh, thank you, Papa Smurf.

12:45.139 --> 12:49.110
Mind wins out over matter
every time, I always say.

12:49.129 --> 12:52.080
- And--
- Smurf up, Brainy!

12:55.029 --> 12:56.080
thud

12:59.129 --> 13:01.220
[theme music]
