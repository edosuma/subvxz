00:10.166 --> 00:13.125
There's someone
I need you to see.

George Minchak.

00:13.917 --> 00:14.834
She vets
all of my candidates.

00:14.834 --> 00:17.542
You want her
to know everything.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.542
I'm not really sure I'm
entirely comfortable with that.

Mmmm.

-They closed four years ago.
-Sad.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.000
Surveillance of a federal
employee is a Class E felony,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.417

to keep it up,

00:45.417 --> 00:47.583

23:15.375 --> 23:17.625
a place called Autobahn,
for 90 minutes.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.417
Leaving
less than an hour ago.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.875
Anywhere near here
they might've headed?

23:21.875 --> 23:23.500
Yeah.
Yeah, there was a spot there

23:23.500 --> 23:25.166
she used to go
when she was young.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.750
She'd feel fortified there.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.583
-You want me to--
-No, no.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.417
I'll go.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.083
Gents.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.959
Hey, Axe.
Lara said you'd be showing up.

23:40.959 --> 23:42.750
You or someone
who worked for you.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.250
So she came in here?

23:44.250 --> 23:46.250
Yep, her and the boys.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.917
They fucking fleeced us
out of 20 bucks at darts.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.083
Soon as we tried to up the bet,
they quit.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.250
My boys.
They saw the hustle coming.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.542
Sure did.

23:53.542 --> 23:58.166
Anyway, uh, Lara said
to give her space.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.667
She was going
to your place in the city,

24:00.667 --> 24:03.125
and you could know that,
but to please respect.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.917
She'll get in touch
when she's ready.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.208
And so I'm supposed to what?
Just fucking sit

24:07.208 --> 24:09.500
-on my goddamn--
-You can press her.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.458
But look,
you know her better than us.

24:12.458 --> 24:13.500
You do that and--

24:13.500 --> 24:16.792
Yep. I'll make this look
like the Rose Parade.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.083
Hey, it's me.
I went to Terry's bar.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.917
The memories came flooding back.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.000
Us there at the beginning,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.250
right after I got struck
by the thunderbolt

24:29.250 --> 24:33.166
like Michael with Apollonia.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.750
And I was thinking about

24:35.750 --> 24:39.083
all that rail shit
we used to drink,

24:39.083 --> 24:43.458
but we were already drunk
from being with each other,

24:43.458 --> 24:45.083
so we didn't care.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.458
And then I flipped totally
to the other extreme.

24:49.583 --> 24:52.750
To Paris. That rainy night.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.875
We wouldn't get out of bed
even though the iPod

24:55.875 --> 24:58.083
was playing
"With or Without You" on repeat,

24:58.083 --> 25:00.875
and so we ended up
listening to it all night.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.792
And I was just thinking...

25:03.792 --> 25:08.667
I was thinking how deep it got
between us.

25:08.667 --> 25:11.542
And we promised that if anything
ever threatened us,

25:11.542 --> 25:14.500
we'd remind ourselves
of that night

25:14.500 --> 25:16.834
and we'd try to find
a way back to it.

25:16.834 --> 25:21.583
And I'm reminding you
of that night right now.

25:21.583 --> 25:26.041
Let's fight our way back to it.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.875
Call me, please.

25:34.625 --> 25:38.083
Thank you for finding the time,
Mr. Martinez.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.375
What's the urgent matter?

25:39.375 --> 25:42.375
My laptop was stolen
by a client.

25:44.291 --> 25:45.959
Can you tell me who?

25:45.959 --> 25:47.458
Gave me a backstopped alias.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.708
Came to me for three months.

25:50.708 --> 25:53.041
Worked his way
into my inner sanctum.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.708
You think it's an attack
against me?

25:54.708 --> 25:57.166
You or one of my more
prominent clients.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.417
More prominent than I?

25:59.417 --> 26:01.417
Should come
as no surprise to you

26:01.417 --> 26:03.291
the lifestyle attracts
brilliant people.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.250
Mm-hmm.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.208
Intricate temperaments.

26:06.208 --> 26:09.083
Intricate tastes.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.792
How protected
is your information?

26:11.792 --> 26:15.125
I have a deeply devoted client
from Palo Alto

26:15.125 --> 26:17.375
who's in corporate
cyber defense.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.834
You may rest assured.

26:19.834 --> 26:22.166
And if I were ever approached
personally--

26:22.166 --> 26:25.708
I know that your relationships
are beyond transactional.

26:25.708 --> 26:26.708
The idea
of blackmailing someone

26:26.708 --> 26:28.750
with something so close
to their core,

26:28.750 --> 26:32.750
-of punishing true expression--
-Understood.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.250
Understood.

26:35.250 --> 26:36.875
And thank you.

26:45.375 --> 26:47.583
Pick that up.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.000
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Martinez.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.125
Hmm.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.834
We should do it again
under other circumstances.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.250
Once you've secured
proper permissions, of course.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.542
Of course.

27:33.834 --> 27:35.708
Did you find her?

27:36.166 --> 27:38.500
Yes.

27:39.667 --> 27:42.750
She went into the city
with the boys, but I don't...

27:42.750 --> 27:44.208
know how to bring them home.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.417
I'm sorry.

27:45.417 --> 27:46.959
What do you want?

27:46.959 --> 27:49.750
What I've always wanted,
to help.

27:53.834 --> 27:58.959
I was remembering...
when you first met her.

27:58.959 --> 28:01.000
Me, too.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.834
And you said you felt like
you'd known her forever.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.959
Everyone else was sucking up,
angling.

28:05.959 --> 28:10.041
One date and you were talking
about marriage.

28:11.000 --> 28:11.667
I was skeptical.

28:11.667 --> 28:14.083
I thought that sort of thing

28:14.083 --> 28:17.333
only happened
in the Sicilian hills.

28:17.333 --> 28:20.542
And then I met her.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.583
Then it all made sense.

28:23.708 --> 28:26.834
You know,
she had three close friends

28:26.834 --> 28:28.250
who lost their husbands
on 9/11.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.166
Firemen.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.083
And she helped
to prop them all up,

28:33.083 --> 28:35.208
even after losing
her own brother.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.125
She helped them clean out
their closets,

28:37.125 --> 28:39.875
and you wouldn't think that
that was the toughest thing,

28:39.875 --> 28:42.708
but the way they wept
when they found

28:42.708 --> 28:45.542
a favorite t-shirt
or an old varsity jacket

28:45.542 --> 28:47.875
or a wedding suit.

28:47.875 --> 28:50.708
And then about a week later,
something occurred to her,

28:50.708 --> 28:53.625
and for all three of them,

28:53.625 --> 28:57.708
she found a way to get back
into their bedrooms.

28:57.708 --> 29:01.041
And she crawled under the beds

29:01.041 --> 29:05.458
and retrieved the errant
slipper or sneaker.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.708
She defended them from
those little land mines.

29:10.708 --> 29:13.708
You don't talk
about that side of her much.

29:17.166 --> 29:22.166
Look, I, um...
I know that you feel bad.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.875
But that doesn't fix anything
'cause I tried.

29:28.708 --> 29:30.834

-Why not?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.291

35:44.291 --> 35:45.959

38:32.125 --> 38:33.500

come out and ask.

38:52.834 --> 38:54.542
Is there anything you see
at Axe Capital

38:54.542 --> 38:59.333
that offends your sense

38:59.333 --> 39:02.583

Fairness or right and wrong?

39:04.834 --> 39:07.708
Most people consider those
the same thing.

39:09.417 --> 39:11.417
A stock is like
a living organism,

39:11.417 --> 39:12.667
a sparrow, say.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.917
And we are able to create
an emergent-based

39:14.917 --> 39:16.333
abstraction of that sparrow,

39:16.333 --> 39:18.458
which closely approximates
the sparrow itself,

39:18.458 --> 39:20.333
accounting for
migration patterns,

39:20.333 --> 39:21.583
wind, weather,
and other variables.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.667
We can create a similar
abstraction of a stock,

39:24.667 --> 39:26.500
combining the information
from the specific ETFs

39:26.500 --> 39:29.625
which represent
its underlying dependencies.

39:29.625 --> 39:31.250
And if we apply this
to the stock,

39:31.250 --> 39:32.542
we can predict its delta,

39:32.542 --> 39:34.583
following the path
of its abstracted self

39:34.583 --> 39:35.500
because nature follows
abstraction.

49:01.208 --> 49:05.125
when it came to the sanctity
of her own marriage.

49:05.125 --> 49:08.375
And then I learned something
that I knew would hurt her.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.417
And I just couldn't resist

49:13.417 --> 49:14.125
punching her in the face
with it.

49:16.333 --> 49:18.333
It's a natural urge.

49:18.333 --> 49:19.917
But it didn't
make you feel good.

49:19.917 --> 49:21.125
-No, it did.
-Mm-hmm.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.708
For a second. It was a fucking
electric thrill.

49:24.708 --> 49:29.959
But no, after I... kind of
hate myself for it.

49:30.792 --> 49:33.417
Which is why you're rare
and special.

49:34.792 --> 49:37.250
I know that you hold yourself
to a higher standard

49:37.250 --> 49:39.291
because you're a therapist,

49:39.291 --> 49:42.500
but you're also human.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.667
And you and I both know

49:44.667 --> 49:47.708
it's your humanity that makes
you so good at what you do.

49:49.250 --> 49:51.834
So maybe you just let
yourself off with a warning.

49:54.625 --> 49:55.792
Thank you.

49:57.792 --> 49:59.834
