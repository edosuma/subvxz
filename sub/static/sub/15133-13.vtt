08:32.232 --> 08:33.299
It's complicated.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.068
No, it's simple.

08:35.102 --> 08:36.969
He lost his directing gig.

08:37.004 --> 08:39.505
Now he's scrambling.

08:39.539 --> 08:43.643
Julia, you said that we
would work on this together.

08:43.677 --> 08:44.744
I told my board.

08:44.778 --> 08:46.179
I know.

08:46.213 --> 08:48.214
Let me tell you something
you don't know.

08:48.248 --> 08:51.351
In order to make <i>Hit List</i>
everything it needs to be,

08:51.385 --> 08:54.921
I spent some of the reserves
of next season's budget on it.

08:54.955 --> 08:56.456
If it doesn't transfer
to Broadway,

08:56.490 --> 08:58.691
I have to follow up
with a homerun,

08:58.726 --> 08:59.859
like <i>Gatsby,</i>

08:59.893 --> 09:03.196
or I am out.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.735
Hello, stranger.

09:08.769 --> 09:10.236
Feel like I see you on TV

09:10.270 --> 09:13.139
more than I do in real life.

09:13.173 --> 09:15.074
Might almost believe
you were avoiding my calls.

09:15.109 --> 09:16.342
Of course not.

09:16.377 --> 09:18.011
I'm just really busy right now.

09:18.045 --> 09:20.380
Ticket sales haven't been
as good as Eileen had hoped,

09:20.414 --> 09:23.249
so she's pimping me out
wherever she can.

09:23.283 --> 09:24.684
Okay.

09:24.718 --> 09:25.985
Why don't I come by
after the show?

09:26.019 --> 09:27.754
I can get you off the streets
for a night.

09:27.788 --> 09:28.788
Can't.

09:28.789 --> 09:32.392
I'm moderating a Q&A for
Tom and Julia at table 46.

09:32.426 --> 09:34.727
Oh, fair enough.

09:34.762 --> 09:35.928
How about tomorrow?

09:35.963 --> 09:37.196
Group sales event.

09:37.231 --> 09:39.632
Okay. Friday?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.567
Uh, listen, Derek,
can I call you back?

09:41.602 --> 09:44.604
I have a phone interview
that's about to start.

09:44.638 --> 09:45.638

- Oh! Ah.

09:53.714 --> 09:54.781
I don't know.

09:54.815 --> 09:56.582
There was a lot
of tequila involved.

09:56.617 --> 09:58.317
I hope it was worth it,
because you just lost us

09:58.352 --> 10:01.721
the cover of <i>New York Magazine.</i>

10:01.755 --> 10:03.756
You better get it together,
or seriously...

10:03.791 --> 10:05.058
What? Or what?

10:05.092 --> 10:06.292
The show's gonna close?

10:06.326 --> 10:08.227
The run is sold out, Kyle.
Come on.

10:12.032 --> 10:14.300
He's detoxing.
I hope.

10:14.335 --> 10:15.635
Let me know
if you need any help.

10:15.669 --> 10:18.237
- Thanks.

Are you guys still together?

10:21.775 --> 10:23.209
Of course.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.477
I thought for sure
you'd have told him

10:24.511 --> 10:25.778
about your little affair
by now.

10:25.813 --> 10:26.946
Shut up.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.614
I should've never told you
about Tom.

Hey, hey, there's no shame.

10:29.750 --> 10:30.950

you told me about, huh?

want to do?

to start again, or...

I just don't want the show
to get screwed up

just because I broke up
with him.

12:15.089 --> 12:16.356
It won't.

And look, even if it does,
that's not on you.

Yes, it is.

12:21.195 --> 12:23.730
She begged him to open up
to her for months,

12:23.764 --> 12:25.031
and when he finally did,

12:25.065 --> 12:26.705
she didn't like
what she heard and bailed.

12:26.734 --> 12:29.335
And then she brought her friend
in to audition for his part.

12:29.370 --> 12:31.437
That's not exactly
how that happened.

12:31.472 --> 12:33.106

13:04.938 --> 13:07.640
to move the show to Broadway
this season.

13:07.674 --> 13:09.776
Well, from what I saw
at the winter benefit,

13:09.810 --> 13:12.578
I wouldn't have said
that the show was big enough

13:12.613 --> 13:13.946
for a Broadway transfer.

13:13.981 --> 13:15.782
Well, apparently,
they've made some changes.

to get us two tickets

of threat

How did Scott take it?

He didn't have to.

I'm doing <i>Gatsby</i>
with him in the fall.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.955
I made a promise.
I'm not gonna break it.

I will make you the priority.

16:22.698 --> 16:25.333
Anything that you want
to do with me comes first.

16:25.368 --> 16:27.736
I'll work on <i>Gatsby</i>
in my spare time.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.170
We're supposed to work
on everything together.

16:29.205 --> 16:33.308
That's what a partnership is.

16:33.342 --> 16:35.009
So if you had gotten
<i>City of Angels,</i>

16:35.044 --> 16:37.479
I would've directed it too?

16:37.513 --> 16:39.714
We didn't direct
<i>Bombshell</i> together.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.483
And that was a problem,
apparently.

16:41.517 --> 16:45.387
How was it a problem?
I was totally behind you.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.688
Why wouldn't you do
the same for me?

16:46.722 --> 16:48.690
It's one play.

in our company name.
