- Yeah.
- Get some sun.

Thought I'd come
prepared today, you know.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.365
Well good, 'cause
we're gonna be saddling

02:28.409 --> 02:31.281
so you can show off
your muscles then.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.503
Where's Myles today?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.333
Myles will not be joining us.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.683
He's off the ranch.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.424
Oh.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.647
So we're gonna saddle and we're
gonna pretend

02:49.691 --> 02:53.216
like this is a busy day
at the ranch

02:53.260 --> 02:54.957
when all the customers
come in.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.047
So today's focus will be
to get a rhythm and flow.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.224
And it teaches you guys
as well as the horses.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.182
- Sure, that works.
- Okay.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.444
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.228
We keep the saddles
in this little barn.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.665
So grab your horse.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.102
Hey there, bud.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.366
Really?

03:12.409 --> 03:14.324
You'll have to find
a saddle in there.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.152
All the saddles
are marked in there.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.936
Diamond.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.199
- Found it?
- Yeah.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.504
There's my boy.

03:20.548 --> 03:23.377
I think this part
has to go in the front.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.508
Right.
Correct.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.467
Everybody is
capable of saddling.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.817
I think that you've placed
it really well.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.340
But if we're doing it
for them,

03:30.384 --> 03:31.733
they're never gonna learn it.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.778
Up and over.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.259
Yeah.
Perfect.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.480
Use your muscles.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.351
All right, so I'm gonna
critique you a little bit.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.744
Go ahead and take it down.

03:42.787 --> 03:43.788
Okay.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.051
Again, I'll hold
the blanket.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.531
So the easiest way,

03:47.575 --> 03:49.533
your left hand on
the pommel right here.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.274
- Uh-huh.
- Right hand back here,

03:51.318 --> 03:54.582
and more
of a swing up and over.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.192
Oh, okay, so the thing
doesn't get caught.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
Uh-huh.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.543
Beautiful.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.197
You definitely have
the muscles for it.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.460
- Great.
- Yeah.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.290
Anne, I'm pretty sure
this thing weighs more than me.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.553
- I know.
- It's unreal.

04:09.597 --> 04:14.036
Okay, one, two, three.
Oh, my gosh.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.298
Look at how strong you are.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.735
She's like the little engine
that could.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.694
I feel like I'm becoming
a horse girl

04:19.737 --> 04:21.565
and I would've never imagined.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.350
You didn't need
anybody helping you.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.568
Oh, my gosh.
Okay.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.527
Yeah.
I'm saddling that thing.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.225
This is the nose band.
Just slips on just like that.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.488
Can I show you
a trick for fast, speedy.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.577
If you grab your cinch real
quick

04:33.621 --> 04:34.709
and pull it
all the way through.

04:34.752 --> 04:35.797
Got it.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.973
Yeah.
That seems a little loose.

04:38.016 --> 04:41.237
So let's get
another couple holes.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.588
And then down
through the holes.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.635
Yeah, easy peasy, right?

04:47.678 --> 04:49.027
Right there.
Nice job.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.420
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.856
You got it?
Yep.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.380
Good boy.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.859
How are you feeling?

04:54.903 --> 04:56.905
- I look good today.
- Yes.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.515
What else can I say?

04:58.559 --> 05:00.212
How do you think Austin's
doing today after everything?

05:00.256 --> 05:01.605
That was--that was wild.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.957
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Oh, my God.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.570
But you have to understand,
he was excited to do it.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.441
Uh-uh.
I don't think he liked it.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.357
- You good?
- Yeah, I don't feel good.

05:14.401 --> 05:19.014
You got this, big dog.
You got this, buddy.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.798
He was doing what he does.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.800
And like just pulling through
for the rest of the group.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.498
I wasn't born yesterday.
I know--

05:24.541 --> 05:26.326
I know
the look of excitement.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.415
Oh, gosh.
Are you kidding?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.330
I think Austin's the type
of person

05:30.373 --> 05:32.157
that does things for show.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.681
<i>If there's no one to impress,</i>

05:33.724 --> 05:36.684
I don't think
he would act the same way.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.035
All right, guys,
that was good.

05:40.078 --> 05:43.647
I'm actually feeling pretty
good with the grand reopening.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.867
You're competent.
You're comfortable.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.825
We're all together.
It's teamwork.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.175
- A moving amoeba.
- Okay, see you later.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.438
- All right, guys.
- Bye.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.092
That's a wrap, y'all.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.662
Well, I shouldn't have worn
a white jacket today.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.708
<i>I know.</i> <i>
I'm disgusting.</i>

06:04.276 --> 06:06.409
Do I have time to wash
my hair, do you guys think?

06:06.453 --> 06:07.889
You have like two hours
or so.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.238
- Two, I think.
- Yeah.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.413
Well, I don't think
we're leaving till 02:30.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'm hungry.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.722
Oh, we should get
a little nappy-nap in then.

06:14.765 --> 06:18.552
Yeah, after I eat, then
a little nap, then get ready.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.385
What's up, bro?

06:30.607 --> 06:31.782
Hey, guys.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.436
- Hello?
- What's up, buddy?

06:33.480 --> 06:34.742

06:34.785 --> 06:36.439
Who are you looking for?

06:36.483 --> 06:39.268
- Hana.
- Oh, yeah, right this way.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.748
Let me escort you.

06:40.791 --> 06:44.055

06:44.099 --> 06:47.668

- Wow.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.586
Oh, my gosh.
That's so pretty.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.804
Who are they from?

06:53.848 --> 06:56.241
Oh, they're from Austin.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.505
Aw.

06:58.548 --> 07:02.073
"Pick out your favorite
outfit and be ready

07:02.117 --> 07:04.554

07:04.598 --> 07:08.428
- Aw!
- First official date.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.733
That's awesome.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.039
I think we're due for a date,

07:11.082 --> 07:12.170
'cause I don't think
that was a date before.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.520
<i>We were just shopping.</i>

07:13.563 --> 07:16.000
Okay, so smash or no
on the first date?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.439
What?

07:19.482 --> 07:22.050
<i>If he wants to take me</i> <i>
on a date like, you know,</i>

07:22.093 --> 07:24.226

I think that'd be cool.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.793
- How cute.
- Thank you.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.664
He's so sweet.
That's very thoughtful.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.492
I wish I got flowers.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.711
But we don't want them
to feel left out.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.800
Let's go get them
some flowers.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.541
Yeah.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.804
It's like a--like
half--half bouquet.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.501
Like, I don't know
if he's on a budget

07:38.545 --> 07:39.763
or what, but did he see--

07:39.807 --> 07:41.461
The first thing I noticed,
I was like,

07:41.504 --> 07:43.332
those are the flowers you got?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.812
I've never seen flowers.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.902
I don't know if he picks them
himself or

07:50.731 --> 07:52.254
I'm gonna mind my business.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.433
We have this whole thing?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.782
I think so.

We got another project for you.

So we're gonna be moving
these pigs that are up

So our job today is gonna be
build a four by eight pen

09:16.425 --> 09:19.341
for the pigs down here.
We have one up in the barn.

09:19.384 --> 09:22.213
We have plywood, tools.
Everything you need right here.

09:22.257 --> 09:25.565
- You got a instruction manual?
- Yeah.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.827
Pretty simple.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.524
You need to start
by cleaning this out.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.352
Just sweeping this out
right here.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
We're gonna build a four
by eight box.

<i>I can build a four</i> <i>

09:33.834 --> 09:35.226
<i>It's really not hard.</i>

- What do we got? A bug?

It was a bee.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.714
It was something.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.456
- She gets scared.
- 'cause it's very loud.

09:47.499 --> 09:51.155
Then tomorrow morning,
get these pigs moved down here

09:51.199 --> 09:53.201
because we've got
more chickens coming in

09:53.244 --> 09:54.942
and we got ducks and other
animals.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.596
We always want
our stalls ready.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.901

10:01.601 --> 10:02.863
You guys can get started.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.125
- Okay.
- All right.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.561
Let's get to it.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.519
So first we have to
clean it out, right?

10:07.563 --> 10:08.738
Yeah.

10:08.782 --> 10:12.263
Well, there are glasses
and gloves.

10:12.307 --> 10:15.179
So I will grab some.
- Okay.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.616
Let's get started.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.487
To wood shop?

10:18.530 --> 10:20.663
Yeah, let's just put it up
on this thing.

10:20.707 --> 10:21.751
Nice.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.231
We have to build
this upside down.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.536
So this will be our ceiling.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.583
Then we can take plywood,
work up here.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.106
Harry looks like he knows
what he is doing.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.717
Don't do that in yet.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.459
Harry's ready to go.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.898
- Yeah.
- Nice.

10:37.941 --> 10:41.771

10:41.815 --> 10:43.251
<i>that, like,</i> <i>
you don't have to work,</i>

10:43.294 --> 10:45.253
but I've been working

10:45.296 --> 10:47.429
Harry, here we go.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.474
- We'll put this on the ground.
- Yeah, Harry, go, Harry!

10:58.788 --> 11:00.137
Hey, Jas, you wanna
nail these in?

11:00.181 --> 11:01.791
Oh, yeah.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.535
<i>My favorite production</i> <i>

their real prop master.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.193
So I was the assistant.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.456
Harry hid a lot
of his talents.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.328
We need to do the walls.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.939
Not yet, Harry.

11:18.982 --> 11:22.203
Instead of hurrying up and
trying to nail the in,

11:22.246 --> 11:23.900
let's make sure
we have enough wood,

11:23.944 --> 11:25.467
plan everything out
then we can start--

11:25.510 --> 11:26.903
Well, there's four
pieces of wood.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.600
It's a four piece box,
then we cut the sides.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.645
Okay.
You figure it out then.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.864
Gotcha,
I already did.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.649
Bob The Builder over here.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.914

and I'm not even dating him.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.134

watch him saw the whole time.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.788
Harry, do what
you feel is best.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.311
Yeah, I mean, it's not
one step at a time.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.616
I think we should all like--

11:44.660 --> 11:46.314
let's just make the thing
and get outta here.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.794
Why are you pointing at me?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.273
'Cause you're saying
to wait up on you.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.232

at the same time,

11:51.275 --> 11:52.363
it's never gonna
get done, you know.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.756
So much drama.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.584

have, like, popcorn

11:55.627 --> 11:56.846
and just like
sit back and watch.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.196
- I know, I need popcorn.
- Can I try it?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.981
- Go for it.
- There you go.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.732
Han, Tay, can I get a nail
or something?

12:14.777 --> 12:18.215
Why did you put this wall up
if we have to make a door?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.348
You're the one
running the show.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.700
- So now you have to saw it...
- No, now I'm gonna

this thing on your own.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.464
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, how are you?

19:21.508 --> 19:24.641
Good.
How are you?

19:24.685 --> 19:27.688
- Okay, how we doing today?
- Fine, good--how are you?

19:27.731 --> 19:28.906
Really good, thank you.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.212
Appreciate you coming
to Carl's tonight.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.822
We have really nice
signature cocktails.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.346
I'd like you to kind of
take a peek at those.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.522
- Oh, I can't do that.
- You--are you allergic?

19:35.565 --> 19:36.914
Yeah.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.525
I was kidding, but I
don't know how that works.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.353
- No, I'm not.
- Okay.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.616
Could I get a water?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.095
Cool.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.706
Can I get the--a glass
of a Cabernet?

19:45.749 --> 19:48.143
I haven't had ne
of those in so long.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.321
I have anxiety and I--I think
alcohol is an escape.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.018
What do you say we
pour up some whiskey tonight?

19:54.062 --> 19:56.891
I'm taking the night off.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.153
Did you drink yesterday?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.024
Yeah, I had
a co--I had a few beers.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.287
- I smelt it on you.
- Yeah.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.767
I'm just trying
to not drink so much.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.117
It's my goal.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.163
- I need a drink.
- Yeah, I hear you.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.818
Can I do an old fashioned?

20:10.861 --> 20:13.168
Ebie, what do you want
a shot of right now?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.778
I'm just go--
I'm fine with water.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.519
Maybe--oh, I'll do
when--when we make s'mores.

20:16.563 --> 20:17.651
Okay.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.130
When are we gonna
make the s'mores?

20:19.174 --> 20:20.567
Not tonight.
Maybe tomorrow.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.308
I'm down whenever,
to be honest.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.700
All right.
I'll get those drinks in.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.267
- Thank you.
- Beautiful. Thank you.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.486
Very welcome.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.009
I'm a little irritated
with Austin.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.619
- Why?
- Are you?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.360
'Cause like--he's done
a lot for us.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
Obviously.
I won't downplay any of that.

20:33.710 --> 20:37.192
It was just weird to me today
to see him switch so quickly.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.846
That's all that I'm saying.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.588
<i>And while building the</i> <i>
little house for the piglets,</i>

20:41.631 --> 20:44.504
Harry was just really shining,
you know, with his carpentry,

20:46.114 --> 20:48.464
- We got a door.
- Yeah.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.292
Austin is just like,

20:50.336 --> 20:52.425
"I can't stand not having
all the attention."

20:52.468 --> 20:54.209
So he's trying
to damn near steal

20:54.253 --> 20:55.428
the power tools
out of Harry's hands.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.820
Okay, you figure it out then.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.169
Gotcha,
I already did.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.475
Bob The Builder over here.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.869
You know, you wanna
overachieve, overachieve,

21:01.912 --> 21:03.174
<i>but he didn't have to,</i>

21:03.218 --> 21:05.176
<i>you know,</i> <i>
behave that way toward Harry.</i>

21:05.220 --> 21:07.440
Being a wrestler,
he's always on.

21:07.483 --> 21:11.444
I think he's so bred
to be on all the time.

21:11.487 --> 21:12.967
I never noticed it
until today.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.185
Thank you.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.361
I'll be completely
honest with you.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.537
I never noticed
any of it until today.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.366
I think we take a right
on this block.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.368
<i>My dad's very similar</i> <i>
to him.</i>

21:22.411 --> 21:24.805
My dad's very on all the time,
on, on, on, on, on.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.547
My dad is my best friend.
He's just very outgoing,

21:27.590 --> 21:31.202
bubbly, very positive
kind of life of the party.

21:37.731 --> 21:38.949
I see a lot of my dad in him

21:38.993 --> 21:41.735
and--and--I--my dad's
my best friend.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.303
So I just like see
a different side of Austin.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.350
- Oh, here it is.
- Uh-oh.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.221
Hana and Austin are here.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.006
Wait, I didn't know
they were coming.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.224
What up?

21:53.268 --> 21:56.315
Hello?
Hello?

21:56.358 --> 21:58.317
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.535
- Where's Jasmine?
- What's up?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.885
She didn't feel well.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.757
Oh, no way.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.062
How did it go?

22:05.106 --> 22:06.237
- Great.
- Yeah?

22:06.281 --> 22:07.413
Yeah.
We had such a good time.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.545
- What's up, bro?
- Are vibes up or what?

22:09.589 --> 22:11.547
- Yeah.
- How was the hot spring?

22:11.591 --> 22:12.853
The hot springs
was actually...

22:12.896 --> 22:13.984
- Was it?
- Really, really fun.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.334
Yeah, man.

22:18.424 --> 22:19.425
- Awesome.
- It was good.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.949
- Sounds so good.
- It was good.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.521
It's so quiet in here.
What's going on?

22:28.564 --> 22:30.087
Just glad to see
you're so happy.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.698
I mean, to be honest.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.396
I don't really give a
about your date right now.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.751
Growing up, my parents didn't
have the best communication.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.318
<i>I was stuck</i> <i>
in the cross hairs.</i>

22:43.362 --> 22:46.408
My dad taught me that at a very
young age like, you know,

22:46.452 --> 22:49.368
there's a problem, address it,
fix it right there on the spot.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.370
Like, we don't
let problems pile up.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.849
What did I do?

22:52.893 --> 22:55.374
Bro, you were being
an attention whore.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.941
Really?

23:00.248 --> 23:02.119
It just seems like it's
always about you, I don't know.

23:02.163 --> 23:05.079
Who the gets down
and dirty on every job?

23:05.122 --> 23:06.602
Me!

23:06.646 --> 23:11.215
I do
everything on this ranch.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.303
Trust me, I'm not
doing it tomorrow.

23:12.347 --> 23:13.522
Oh, really?

23:13.566 --> 23:15.219
I'm gonna force somebody else
to do it.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.178
Oh, [bleep], then I guess
that job's not getting done.

23:19.006 --> 23:19.963
I know why you do that.

23:20.007 --> 23:20.964
- Not me.
- Why?

23:21.008 --> 23:22.183
'Cause you want
the attention.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.793
no, I want
to get the job done

23:23.837 --> 23:25.795
so we don't get
kicked off this ranch

23:25.839 --> 23:27.754
'cause you guys
don't want do the job.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.627
Ooh, did you
just point at me?

23:31.671 --> 23:33.237
Did you stick your
arm in a cow's ass?

23:33.281 --> 23:34.674
Absolutely not.
Surely didn't,

23:34.717 --> 23:35.762
and I'm proud of that.
- Absolutely.

23:35.805 --> 23:36.937
And if I didn't do that,
you guys

23:36.980 --> 23:38.852
wouldn't have
gotten this job done.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.636
Yes, so I'd think
you were a team player.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.029
I'm just letting
you know from what I saw.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.639
You don't think I'm
a team player?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.032
All right, guys.
We're at a restaurant.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.642
Let's just talk
about this at home.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.165
- that.
- Relax.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.863
I'm not gonna be confronted
about this bullshit--

23:49.906 --> 23:51.952
I don't want to talk about
it--let's not talk about it--

23:51.995 --> 23:53.693
- Who gives a shit--
- We're at a restaurant, relax.

23:53.736 --> 23:54.694
No, Austin, tell us
more about your date.

23:54.737 --> 23:55.738
Let's hear you.
- it.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.261
You don't care
about it anyways.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.874
So I'm gonna keep it 100
and not tell you about

24:00.917 --> 24:02.397
You don't want
the attention from it?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.659
Nah, absolutely not.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.836
You came in here smiling
cheesy as

24:06.880 --> 24:08.011
'Cause I had
a really good time.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.273
'cause he's happy!

24:09.317 --> 24:10.536
I had a really
good time with her.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.625
All right, whatever.
Han, how was the date?

24:15.323 --> 24:18.021
<i>Redmond's beef with Austin</i> <i>
is shocking.</i>

24:18.065 --> 24:19.501
<i>Redmond doesn't get that</i>

24:19.545 --> 24:21.851
Austen just tries
like too hard to fit in.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.508
Okay.
That was nice.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.685
Good Lord.
Smile, Red.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.644
Can you please tell us
about your date?

24:31.687 --> 24:33.297
Ain't gonna happen.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
Red, be nice.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.388
All right.
So should we go?

24:37.432 --> 24:41.567
How about maybe we do
the s'mores and let's relax.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.525
I think we should get
PJs and chill.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.700
Yeah.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.571
Let's get the
outta here.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.094
Yeah, come on.

all the chores tomorrow too.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.533
Come on, dog.

You like step in front

Honestly, I just feel like

any of us, to be honest.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.966
Yeah, you just wanna be seen.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.795

26:39.206 --> 26:40.555
This is what I do.
I burn the outside

26:40.599 --> 26:42.296
and then I peel it
and then I burn it again.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.385

Dude, I can't--I don't know
if I can do this.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.484
Got it looking
like a "rotisserarie" chicken.

26:56.527 --> 27:00.793
Look like
a "rotisserarie" chicken.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.011
Wait, how do you say it?

27:02.055 --> 27:04.144
- Rotisserie.
- Rotisserie.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.149
Wait, I thought that's how
you said it my entire life.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.498
No!

Oh, that's an expert popped.
Are you kidding me?

27:15.546 --> 27:19.202
Wow, that was so naughty.

27:21.465 --> 27:24.033
Whoa.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.079
That was like,
you expected me to do it.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.825
You had it down.
You had it down, sis.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.304
S'more, more s'more.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.133
We're learning a lot
about Ebie tonight.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.353
It's a little
loud out there.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.485
Yeah!

27:41.529 --> 27:43.226
I know.
It's really loud out there.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.314
It's like when people
get super delirious,

27:44.358 --> 27:45.576
everyone's like...

27:45.620 --> 27:47.187
Yeah, yeah.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.058
That's not too stressful
for you to--

27:49.102 --> 27:51.974
it's not like loud
and annoying?

27:52.018 --> 27:53.367
I think that
I like that though.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.847
- Yeah.
- But like I--

27:54.890 --> 27:56.718

way in the public eye,

29:01.261 --> 29:02.871

with stuff

29:02.915 --> 29:04.612

29:04.655 --> 29:06.570
if I was out partying like,
"Oh, Tay has a problem."

29:06.614 --> 29:08.572
Because my dad was known
to have a problem.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.705

like, I'm just out at a bar

29:10.749 --> 29:12.272

and they're like,

29:12.315 --> 29:14.100
"Oh, like, look, she's like
an alcoholic like her dad."

- Yeah, it was really bad.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.255

because it was like

29:39.299 --> 29:40.387
everywhere I went,
people were like...

29:43.129 --> 29:44.304
Oh.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.435
So people would
take cheeseburgers

29:45.479 --> 29:46.523
and would throw them at me.

29:46.567 --> 29:47.698
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

29:47.742 --> 29:48.917

it would be funny.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.745
I don't wanna get too much
into that video

29:50.789 --> 29:52.355
'cause there's a lot
of things with that.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.488

a private moment

29:54.531 --> 29:55.881
<i>between me and my dad.</i>

29:55.924 --> 29:59.449

a humbling experience.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.712

the exact same way.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.499

and so I realizing--

30:05.542 --> 30:06.892

30:06.935 --> 30:08.502

You know what I mean.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.112

so awful to me

30:10.156 --> 30:12.375
and I got it forever.
"You're a trust fund baby."

30:12.419 --> 30:14.595
Or "You just party
all the time."

30:14.638 --> 30:17.163
I'm like, "No, I actually work
my ass off all day long

30:17.206 --> 30:18.555
"and like, have
this going for me.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.166

37:06.963 --> 37:07.921
I need a shower.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.052
I'm freaking tired.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.402
Gosh,

37:10.445 --> 37:13.535
I'm never getting
a piggy bank ever again.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.494
Harry, those are brand-new
shoes, mother

37:15.537 --> 37:17.060
Then you shouldn't have
brought them

37:17.104 --> 37:18.366
to Saddleback Ranch.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.413
- Security--
- Get the out of here.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.544
You go get--
no, don't touch me.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.899
Yay, Harry.

37:29.943 --> 37:35.644
Oh, my God.
It's the sex icon himself!

37:36.776 --> 37:38.691
Holy [bleep], man.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.520
- Yeah.
- Harry, come here, buddy.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.086
I'm exhausted.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.959
<i>So I wanna relax,</i> <i>
but Harry's drinking already.</i>

37:49.310 --> 37:52.618
<i>I'm just happy the work</i> <i>
with the pigs is done.</i>

37:52.661 --> 37:54.272
So I think it's time
to celebrate.

38:02.105 --> 38:09.025
<i>♪</i>

38:14.553 --> 38:17.599
Oh, God.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.085
What the [bleep]?

38:25.128 --> 38:27.261
Why is there a shoe
in the middle of the road?

38:27.305 --> 38:30.264
Because drunk
Harry is gonna dirty up

38:30.308 --> 38:34.224
my shoes that are brand-new
white

38:34.268 --> 38:38.228
and act like
it's a funny joke.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.360
- Huh?
- What?

38:39.404 --> 38:42.363
What?

38:42.407 --> 38:43.582
You dirtied up his shoes?

38:43.625 --> 38:44.931
I didn't touch your shoes.

38:44.974 --> 38:48.326
That was over the line,
Harry, over the line.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.590
Harry, those are brand-new
shoes, mother

38:51.633 --> 38:52.939
Then you shouldn't
have brought them

38:52.982 --> 38:55.115
to Saddleback Ranch.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.986
- Why?
- Here on the Saddleback Ranch,

38:57.030 --> 38:59.989
we actually work,
which you don't understand.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.948
<i>Austin thinks</i> <i>
he does all the work.</i>

39:01.991 --> 39:03.428
<i>Nothing about hard work--</i>

39:03.471 --> 39:05.473
<i>like, he does</i> <i>
work hard on his, like--</i>

39:05.517 --> 39:06.953
on his ego.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.434
Good measurement.
Look at this.

39:09.477 --> 39:12.437
It's this side, genius.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.786
I need a beer.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.396
<i>For me, it's about</i> <i>
completing a task.</i>

39:15.440 --> 39:17.790
It's satisfying to me
that I completed it.

39:19.226 --> 39:20.923
But for him,
it's just all about

39:20.967 --> 39:22.664
the way
other people see him.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.241
Oh, God, what a day.

39:39.159 --> 39:43.337
You're in my trap now,
Mr. Man.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.905
Now get the
off me, man.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.211
Austin and Harry,
I don't get their relationship.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.735
It is so bizarre.

39:49.778 --> 39:50.997
<i>One minute,</i> <i>
they're best friends.</i>

39:51.040 --> 39:52.172
<i>One minute</i> <i>
they hate each other.</i>

39:52.215 --> 39:54.740
It is the most
confusing relationship.

39:56.306 --> 39:59.397
Harry has entered
blacked out mode.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.749
I'm not blacked out.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.621
Say that one more time,
see what happens.

40:09.755 --> 40:13.149
You drank 81 beers tonight.
- What?

40:14.107 --> 40:16.196
I'll ask you in the morning
when you're sober.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.114
I--okay.

40:23.246 --> 40:26.119
I think that you always--
I don't know why,

40:26.162 --> 40:29.078
but you always think that
you have to act a certain way

40:29.122 --> 40:31.907
or be a certain way.
You seem very fake.

40:33.169 --> 40:34.867
What way--what ways
am I fake?

40:34.910 --> 40:36.259
You--you're--you--you

40:36.303 --> 40:37.870
always think
you have to be on and be--no,

40:37.913 --> 40:39.219
I'm not--I'm being serious.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.439
I think Austin and Harry
need therapy.

40:41.482 --> 40:44.180
<i>They need to go to an</i> <i>
intensive like couples therapy</i>

40:44.224 --> 40:46.705
because they do fight
like brothers.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.838
- Hear me out.
- Okay, Mr. Blacked Out Man.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.625
It sometimes goes
a little bit too far.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.888
I think you're--I think
you're fake as [bleep],

40:55.931 --> 40:57.411
like to say it that way.

40:57.455 --> 41:01.415
Me and Harry, when we're
both sober, we joke around.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.982
We have a great time,

41:03.025 --> 41:06.420
but there's literally
no reasoning with drunk Harry.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.901
- Han.
- What?

41:08.944 --> 41:10.250
You look scared.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.426
- I'm not scared...
- No, it's just weird--

41:12.470 --> 41:15.081
it's weird how we transitioned
into something so serious.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.518
No, I--well you made
it serious, but I--

41:17.562 --> 41:18.737
I made it serious?

41:18.780 --> 41:19.738
You just called me
fake as

41:19.781 --> 41:20.869
How did I make it serious?

41:20.913 --> 41:22.436
'Cause I think
you are fake,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.046
- Fine.
- And I--

41:24.090 --> 41:26.222
That's fine, but I'm saying
you made it serious.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.659
No.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.922
Let me go talk to Ebie
for a sec--give me a second.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.924
Yeah, go get
some motivation.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.447
Don't talk to me that way.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.014
No, don't talk to me the way
you're talking to me

41:35.057 --> 41:36.537
in that chair to me.

41:36.581 --> 41:40.498
Damn, I go upstairs
for two seconds and

41:40.541 --> 41:43.152
- I'm done.
- I'm not an asshole like you.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.937
Okay, get--just please
get out of my face.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.242
I'm not in your face, dude.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.767
I'm like
three miles away from you.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.899
Just stop talking.
Stop talking.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.597
- Are you drunk?
- No, just stop talking.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.946
Are you drunk?

41:53.989 --> 41:55.425
Stop talking to me.
Stop talking to me.

41:55.469 --> 41:56.775
Don't tell me
what to do, seriously.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.211
I'm chilling.
I'm chilling.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.952
No, I'm being serious.
Don't tell me what to do.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.127
Okay, I'll remove myself
from this situation.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.302
- Please.
- Jesus Christ.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.738
- Yeah, go inside.
- drunk.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.392
Like I told you.
Get out of here.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.138
Don't touch me.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.835
Don't--don't rock my chair.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.402
I don't know if you're drunk.
I don't know if you're drunk.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.186
I don't know
if this is becoming serious.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.318
No, seriously, don't touch
my chair like that.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.450
Don't touch me.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.322
Relax.
Relax.

42:22.365 --> 42:25.238
- Don't touch my chair.
- Relax, relax.

42:25.281 --> 42:27.632
Relax.

42:27.675 --> 42:29.285
If you touch me,
I'm telling you,

42:29.329 --> 42:31.287
I'm gonna fire back.

42:31.331 --> 42:32.593
Back away from me.
I'm serious.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.856
Fire back--you
push my chair like that.

42:34.900 --> 42:38.120
Get the outta here.

42:38.164 --> 42:40.601
Redmond,
call security please.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.516
Get the out of here.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.953
- Step in before I [bleep]--
- Get the out of here.

42:44.997 --> 42:46.825
Get out of my house.

42:46.868 --> 42:49.392
You go get--
no, don't touch me, bro.

42:51.873 --> 42:54.659
<i>Next time on "Relatively</i> <i>
Ranch Rules."</i>

42:54.702 --> 42:57.052
We thought it would be
really nice if we spend

42:57.096 --> 42:59.838
some quality time
with your girls.

42:59.881 --> 43:01.361
We're great babysitters.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.058
- Hello! <i>
- Hey, hide the alcohol.</i>

43:03.102 --> 43:05.191
The girls are here.

43:05.234 --> 43:07.019
What are we doing right now?

43:08.411 --> 43:10.370
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing?

43:10.413 --> 43:11.893
We're getting ready
for our job.

43:11.937 --> 43:14.940
We're gonna teach you guys
how to properly move cattle.

43:14.983 --> 43:17.159
Don't spook 'em.
Harry, don't run with them.

43:17.203 --> 43:19.335
There're picking up
some speed.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.728
Uh-oh.

43:20.772 --> 43:22.556
- What's wrong?
- You okay?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.558
I can't kick with
this leg though--my knee...

43:24.602 --> 43:25.690
Oh, no.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.213
Let me have
some hot dog.

43:27.256 --> 43:28.606
- Don't around...
- Whoa.

43:28.649 --> 43:29.607
- Go cook yourself some dinner.
- Or else what?

43:29.650 --> 43:31.130
What are you gonna do?

43:31.173 --> 43:32.697
- Back the up.
- You don't scare me.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.089
Let's go then.
