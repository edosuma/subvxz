00:01.648 --> 00:04.734
Welcome back to our continuing
coverage of the 2014

00:04.852 --> 00:07.737
scoungbine here at Lucas Oil
Stadium in Indianapolis.

00:07.855 --> 00:08.921
I'm Rich Eisen.

00:09.056 --> 00:11.524
We've got a lot of potential
first-rounders out there today,

00:11.692 --> 00:15.195
and then it looks like someone has
seen <i> Rudy</i> one too many times.

00:15.459 --> 00:17.326
Kevin MacArthur,
five foot eleven.

00:17.461 --> 00:20.913
Weight, 160 pounds, but that looks
like it could be about 100

00:21.048 --> 00:22.248
chicken parms ago.

00:22.416 --> 00:25.501
He's probably pushing a buck 80,
and sources tell us ten pounds

00:25.636 --> 00:27.420
that could be back hair.

00:27.588 --> 00:28.548
KEVIN: Carlos Hyde, huh?

00:28.639 --> 00:30.119
Hey, man, we could
be combine buddies.

00:30.140 --> 00:32.008
There's no buddies
at the combine.

00:32.142 --> 00:33.426
Ha, Mike Evans.

00:33.594 --> 00:35.678
Hey, what say you draft me in
your fantasy draft and I'll

00:35.813 --> 00:36.734
draft you in mine, huh?

00:36.847 --> 00:37.730
No, I don't think so.

00:37.823 --> 00:38.343
Why not, man?

00:38.348 --> 00:39.232
I'm a sleeper.

00:39.349 --> 00:40.309
Nobody sleeps that deep.

00:40.434 --> 00:41.267
I'm a little busy.

00:41.435 --> 00:42.435
What? Whoa!

00:42.603 --> 00:43.603
Oh, good thing you caught that.

00:43.737 --> 00:45.104
Ready... oh.

00:45.239 --> 00:47.599
Here's Mike Evans running the
gauntlet, showing off the ball

00:47.608 --> 00:51.444
skills that should get him drafted
in the top ten this year.

00:51.612 --> 00:53.279
Oh... ow.

00:53.447 --> 00:54.614
And then there's that.

00:54.748 --> 00:57.917
MacArthur, swatting at the ball like
a baboon sitting on a hornet's nest.

00:58.035 --> 00:58.918
Oh! Ow.

00:59.036 --> 00:59.919
Aah!

01:00.037 --> 01:02.371
Now, it's hard to tell how his
game will project to the NFL

01:02.506 --> 01:04.873
level, but one must assume that
once the helmet goes on, he

01:05.007 --> 01:07.360
won't be able to catch as
many balls with his face.

01:07.494 --> 01:09.128
God, one got me
right in the taint.

01:09.263 --> 01:13.299
Some players come out too early... and
some should never come out at all.

01:13.433 --> 01:14.393
There we go, here we go.

01:14.434 --> 01:15.384
(Kevin shrieks)

01:15.519 --> 01:16.385
Just pick... Just pick it up.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.560
I can't, I can't, I can't.

01:17.604 --> 01:18.471
You got to help me.

01:18.605 --> 01:19.939
(Kevin grunts, snorts)

01:20.057 --> 01:20.940
Oh!

01:21.058 --> 01:22.441
It's all right, Daddy's got you.

01:22.559 --> 01:23.442
That counts as one.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.810
He's a tweener for sure.

01:24.945 --> 01:27.146
Somewhere between
mediocre and irrelevant.

01:27.314 --> 01:29.115
(Kevin shouts)

01:29.233 --> 01:30.566
Oh, God.

01:30.701 --> 01:32.201
All right.

01:32.319 --> 01:33.286
All right, switch it.

01:33.403 --> 01:34.287
No. No, no.

01:34.404 --> 01:36.038
Please don't do this.

01:36.156 --> 01:39.242
(Kevin squeaks)

01:39.376 --> 01:41.494
All right, okay.

01:41.628 --> 01:42.745
You got me that time.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.247
Let's run it again.

01:44.381 --> 01:45.548
What you got, little man?

01:45.666 --> 01:46.666
No-- Stephon Tuitt.

01:46.833 --> 01:48.417
Come on No, no, I don't want to.

01:48.552 --> 01:49.418
Pick up the pad, little man.

01:49.553 --> 01:50.419
I'm not doing it.

01:50.554 --> 01:51.054
Pick it up.

01:51.088 --> 01:52.004
I'm not doing it!

01:52.139 --> 01:52.700
Get back here.

01:52.756 --> 01:53.716
Oh, my God, he's so big!

01:53.757 --> 01:55.007
He's so big!

01:55.142 --> 01:56.008
Stop it!

01:56.143 --> 01:59.011
I'm told Kevin is also a lawyer,
although from where I'm standing...

01:59.146 --> 02:00.012
(shrieks): No!

02:00.147 --> 02:02.848
...his skill set doesn't appear to
translate into any discernable position.

02:03.016 --> 02:03.976
No! No, don't do it, no!

02:04.017 --> 02:05.518
Here... or in the legal world.

02:05.686 --> 02:06.235
I'm dying here, Eisen.

02:06.353 --> 02:07.737
Why are you even here right now?

02:07.854 --> 02:08.738
Go home.

02:08.854 --> 02:09.354
You're terrible.

02:09.489 --> 02:10.356
Boo.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.525
ALL: Sacko, Sacko... Sacko.

02:12.659 --> 02:13.526
No.

02:13.660 --> 02:17.196
...Sacko, Sacko, Sacko...
And we have urine.

02:17.331 --> 02:18.614
That's a combine first.

02:18.749 --> 02:23.753
(whining): No...
(Kevin exclaims)

02:23.870 --> 02:25.338
Oh.

02:25.455 --> 02:27.373
Oh, God, I had the worst dream.

02:27.507 --> 02:29.542
JENNY: Go back to bed, Sacko.

02:29.710 --> 02:34.797
Oh, my life is worse
than my nightmare.

02:34.932 --> 02:36.716
Is the bed wet?

02:37.192 --> 02:43.405
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:43.525 --> 02:48.477
Your champion wants to tell
you all about the 2014 league

02:48.612 --> 02:54.450
draft plan. I am thinking an extravagant
dinner. We are going to do one course

02:54.568 --> 02:57.403
per round.
All on my dime.

02:57.571 --> 03:00.740
So put it down in your
calendars-- August 23rd, okay?

03:00.907 --> 03:02.792
Oh, what's that-- I'm sorry, you
don't have calendars?

03:02.909 --> 03:04.744
Oh, let me help you with that.
Whoa.

03:04.911 --> 03:06.245
Oh!
You made calendars?

03:06.413 --> 03:09.248
Calendars. RUXIN: That's a pretty hot move.
ANDRE: Did you hire a

03:09.416 --> 03:11.250
professional photographer?
I did.

03:11.418 --> 03:13.886
PETE: Looks like we finally
found somebody to satisfy Jenny

03:14.004 --> 03:15.921
in the bedroom.
Wh-What is this one?

03:16.089 --> 03:17.923
Why is October this picture?
I don't want this picture out

03:18.091 --> 03:22.228
there. This is borderline
Sacktual harassment. I disagree.

03:22.346 --> 03:24.563
I'd say this borders more on
domestic Sacktual abuse.

03:24.681 --> 03:27.183
Oh, no, no, no, guys.
There's absolutely no Sacktual

03:27.317 --> 03:29.235
abuse happening here.
Ho, ho.

03:29.353 --> 03:31.237
You had coffee mugs up?
Wow.

03:31.355 --> 03:33.322
Mm-hmm.
To commemorate this wonderful

03:33.440 --> 03:37.326
moment, I have actually decided to
officially change my team name. Really?

03:37.444 --> 03:40.162
I am no longer going to be
Pete Top, Kevin Bottom.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.281
I am now gonna be Jenny Top,
Kevin Bottom.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.283
That doesn't bother me--
that's my favorite position.

03:44.418 --> 03:49.288
Well, the other option was gonna be
Andre 3,000 Dingers in His Face. Oh.

03:49.423 --> 03:52.124
(laughs)
That's good, that's good.

03:52.259 --> 03:54.960
I like how you do thing where it
sounds like a joke but there's

03:55.095 --> 03:57.380
no actual punch line.
Anyway, can't waste time with

03:57.514 --> 03:59.382
you guys, I have to get to my
office-- I have a little pre-op

03:59.516 --> 04:01.384
conversation with the mayor's
wife.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.769
Ooh, what's she having done?
Can't say, but let's just say

04:03.887 --> 04:07.139
it involves me going downtown.
All right, later, losers.

04:07.274 --> 04:10.643
What the hell was that?
I don't like successful,

04:10.777 --> 04:13.279
confident Andre.
Yeah, it's as if he looked at

04:13.397 --> 04:15.281
us with complete disdain.
I know that look.

04:15.399 --> 04:17.358
That's the look that I give you
guys all the time.

04:17.401 --> 04:19.285
TACO: Hey, Sacko, can I
borrow these?

04:19.403 --> 04:21.320
No.
It's not your decision.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.489
You gonna play some golf?
Yeah, love golf.

04:23.623 --> 04:26.158
It's such a great way to unwind
after a long eight-hour work

04:26.293 --> 04:28.494
week.
Where do you play golf?

04:28.662 --> 04:31.881
All or the place.
You guys want to play?

04:31.998 --> 04:35.835
(BOTH): Sure.
It's a dogleg right.

04:35.969 --> 04:38.337
It's 240 yards.
(whistles)

04:38.472 --> 04:40.339
Oh, yeah, got all of that one.

04:40.474 --> 04:42.341
(whoops)
Nice one, Taco.

04:42.476 --> 04:44.677
Street golf, not so bad.
Yeah, you don't even have to

04:44.811 --> 04:46.929
worry about a tee time this way.
Yeah, none of that country

04:47.064 --> 04:49.231
club attitude.
As low-rent as this is, it

04:49.349 --> 04:52.017
does maintain the basic function
of golf, which is to get away

04:52.185 --> 04:54.019
from your wife and children.
Next hole?

04:54.187 --> 04:56.707
I'm happy with my long game, but
my short game's in the shitter.

04:56.823 --> 04:58.691
You know, one thing I did
notice is that, uh, you tend to

04:58.825 --> 05:00.693
take your eye off the ball at
that very last second.

05:00.827 --> 05:04.196
Oh, really? Yeah, you could follow
through on that and do a little better.

05:04.331 --> 05:07.199
Oh, okay, I'll work on that.
Yeah, whoo!

05:07.334 --> 05:09.251
Birdie!

05:12.289 --> 05:15.374
Aw.
Sliced it.

05:15.542 --> 05:18.711
Excuse us, playing through.
Pardon us, sorry, guys.

05:18.879 --> 05:23.215
Excuse us. I might take a drop on this one.
Trying to find my ball.

05:23.383 --> 05:25.551
Oh, it's in the rough.
Folks, I'm just gonna play

05:25.685 --> 05:28.437
through real quick.
Um... you want to go play the

05:28.555 --> 05:30.439
next hole?
Yeah, we should go.

05:30.557 --> 05:33.943
Yeah. That one's on us, guys, thank you.
Thank you.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.444
What are we gonna do about
Andre?

05:35.562 --> 05:37.947
All of our beautifully timed,
well-crafted insults are

05:38.064 --> 05:39.949
bouncing off him-- nothing is
sticking to him.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.284
No, he's like Teflondre.
Ugh, Teflondre sucks.

05:42.402 --> 05:44.487
Mm-hmm.
I feel like it's my job as

05:44.621 --> 05:46.539
the Sacko commissioner to take
that guy down a notch.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.541
What about Kevin?
Aren't we gonna do more Sacko

05:48.658 --> 05:52.995
punishments? No, Jenny's doing a better
job than all of us could. An24-7.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.797
Mmm.
You like me on top?

05:54.915 --> 05:56.465
Mm-hmm, I do, it's my
favorite.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.223
See-- Jenny Top, Kevin
Bottom, not so bad.

05:58.335 --> 05:59.718
No, no, don't say it like that.

05:59.836 --> 06:01.220
No?
No.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.222
Do you want me to tickle your
Sacko?

06:03.340 --> 06:06.342
No. Ye... No, no, just...
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

06:06.476 --> 06:08.594
What? Oh...
Look, look, okay...

06:08.728 --> 06:11.288
You can't belittle the Sacko all
day long and then expect my sack

06:11.431 --> 06:14.150
to work at night.
Okay, tonight let's maybe try

06:14.267 --> 06:16.485
a little role reversal.
You be the champ.

06:16.603 --> 06:18.487
Okay.
(soft chuckle)

06:18.605 --> 06:22.775
'Cause I am your sweet,
submissive... Sacko.

06:22.943 --> 06:25.161
No!
No, don't say that.

06:25.278 --> 06:29.165
Don't say what? The "S" word, don't...
Shiva or Sacko? Oh, either.

06:29.282 --> 06:30.950
Come on.
What?

06:31.084 --> 06:32.952
This is domestic Sacktual abuse.

06:33.086 --> 06:37.289
Well, what am I supposed to
do-- stop being so goddamn good?

06:37.424 --> 06:42.328
I'm never gonna get any.
All right, another mock draft

06:42.462 --> 06:44.847
done.
Ruxin is looking good, getting

06:44.965 --> 06:49.635
ready for the real draft.
Ooh, it's gonna be a fun season.

06:49.803 --> 06:54.106
What's this now? Guess I must have joined
a league by accident. Here, cancel.

06:54.224 --> 06:56.725
Hey, wait, what is this, now?
Another league wants a trade?

06:56.860 --> 06:59.144
No.
No, no, no, no.

06:59.312 --> 07:02.314
Romo... What-What, wait...
No, no, I don't want to make a

07:02.482 --> 07:04.316
trade with you, so stop calling
me.

07:04.484 --> 07:06.318
Good-bye.
What is going on with you?

07:06.486 --> 07:08.571
Who are you trading with?
I... I went to do some mock

07:08.705 --> 07:12.241
drafts, and instead of taking me
to my team page, the stupid site

07:12.375 --> 07:14.994
took me to one of these
randomized league-creating team

07:15.161 --> 07:17.246
pages, and now I'm in some
leagues with some total stranger

07:17.380 --> 07:19.632
idiots.
How many leagues are you in?

07:19.749 --> 07:22.051
I'm in 12 leagues.
You did 12 mock drafts?

07:22.168 --> 07:24.053
Yeah, I was doing them reps,
getting ready for the real

07:24.170 --> 07:25.554
thing.
So if you're in 12 leagues,

07:25.672 --> 07:27.592
let me ask you this: are you
cool in any of them?

07:27.674 --> 07:29.091
Oh!
Oh!

07:29.226 --> 07:30.593
From downtown.
Yeah.

07:30.727 --> 07:32.595
Nice one, Andre.
I never realized that being

07:32.729 --> 07:34.897
in a league with strangers would
actually be worse than a league

07:35.015 --> 07:36.899
with people I truly hate.
I get it.

07:37.017 --> 07:39.685
I've been trying to jump out of
this Dumpster fire forever.

07:39.903 --> 07:42.104
Well, look who it is-- the
full buffet of sadness.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.356
Hello, Ted.
Ladies.

07:44.524 --> 07:46.492
Jenny.
I don't have a lot of time.

07:46.610 --> 07:50.446
You see that building behind me?
That's city hall.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.615
You look very handsome, Ted.
Correct.

07:52.749 --> 07:55.200
I am on my way to an AIDS
Foundation charity event.

07:55.335 --> 07:57.419
Little bit of context I have for
you is...

07:57.537 --> 07:59.457
I'm receiving an award.
It wouldn't be the Shiva,

07:59.539 --> 08:01.707
though, would it?
Because the Shiva is sitting

08:01.841 --> 08:03.709
right here.
By the way, Jenny, if you

08:03.877 --> 08:05.711
need help throwing your
extravaganza, I can get you a

08:05.879 --> 08:08.881
list of high-end chefs that'll...
Oh, oh, call me. No, no, no, no, no.

08:09.015 --> 08:10.549
We don't need any help.
Thank you, Ted.

08:10.684 --> 08:12.268
I would love that, thank you.
All right, just relax over

08:12.385 --> 08:14.270
there, Sacko.
I've called us all here today

08:14.387 --> 08:16.722
because this league needs some
changes.

08:16.856 --> 08:20.392
What I'm proposing is we add two
new members.

08:20.527 --> 08:24.063
We become a ten-team league.
That's interesting.

08:24.197 --> 08:26.231
No, we're and eight-team
league-- we always have been, we

08:26.366 --> 08:28.233
always will be.
I could leave.

08:28.368 --> 08:30.819
No, Taco, you need to stay,
because Kevin needs someone he

08:30.954 --> 08:32.905
thinks he can beat.
(all laugh)

08:33.073 --> 08:34.907
Where is this coming from?
Sounds to me like Kevin is

08:35.075 --> 08:36.942
the new Andre.
Am I hearing this correctly?

08:37.077 --> 08:38.460
Oh.
No, he's not.

08:38.578 --> 08:40.578
He's kind of right.
Kevin is the new Andre.

08:40.714 --> 08:42.581
Ha, ha.
I'm same old Kev.

08:42.716 --> 08:44.583
If the hat fits... oh!
Oh!

08:44.718 --> 08:46.135
Hey!
Yes.

08:46.252 --> 08:49.888
(laughs)
Hey there, new Dre, the only

08:50.006 --> 08:54.593
thing worse than AIDS is Dre.
(tires screech)

08:54.728 --> 08:56.979
Oh!
Whoa.

08:57.097 --> 08:59.682
Is he okay?
Oh, my God, he's not moving.

08:59.816 --> 09:03.936
Oh, my God, he's dead!
He's dead.

09:04.070 --> 09:07.439
And his last words were, "Kevin
is the new Andre."

09:07.574 --> 09:13.278
Well, at least he died doing
what he loved-- making fun of you, Kevin.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.021
Ugh, these guys are trolling
me now.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.896
Just turn your phone off, Ruxin.

09:21.014 --> 09:23.182
Gonna check out the snack table.

09:23.316 --> 09:25.184
Oh, you know what, Andre, you
should take that hat off.

09:25.352 --> 09:27.653
Oh, out of a sign of respect?
No, 'cause it's so terrible.

09:27.771 --> 09:30.189
Whoa, whoa, this is not the
time.

09:30.323 --> 09:33.158
(sighs)
Teflondre, man.

09:33.276 --> 09:34.660
Hi.
Hi.

09:34.778 --> 09:37.663
Oh, Kevin, Jenny, so good to
see you, thank you for coming.

09:37.781 --> 09:40.916
I am so sorry for your loss.
I can't believe Ted is gone.

09:41.034 --> 09:42.918
Yeah, the way, it's so
unexpected.

09:43.036 --> 09:47.840
Who would have thought Ted would have
died of AIDS... charity. AIDS charity.

09:47.958 --> 09:51.710
I mean, this trade is just
garbage.

09:51.878 --> 09:55.297
That... we would lose Ted and
all those, you know, pervert

09:55.432 --> 09:59.018
arsonists run free.
Thank you all for coming.

09:59.135 --> 10:01.020
So the funeral will be tomorrow?

10:01.137 --> 10:04.523
Yes. Mm-hmm, and after the funeral,
the family will be sitting shiva.

10:04.641 --> 10:06.025
Yes.
I'm sorry?

10:06.142 --> 10:09.228
What... What'd you say? The family
will be sitting shiva. Shiva.

10:09.362 --> 10:12.231
Shiva You mean... You
mean Shiva, right? Shiva.

10:12.365 --> 10:13.732
<i> Shiva.</i>
Shiva.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.868
How is it spelled?
S-H-I-V-A.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.369
Shiva.
Shiva.

10:17.487 --> 10:20.706
And tonight, it-it's a Jewish
custom that Ted's body cannot be

10:20.824 --> 10:23.626
left alone, so we will need
watchers-- shomers.

10:23.743 --> 10:26.045
I understand.
I was Jewish for a brief time

10:26.162 --> 10:28.747
last year.
Listen, we'd be happy to come

10:28.882 --> 10:32.217
back tonight and, uh, be shomers
so we could just see Ted one

10:32.335 --> 10:34.420
last time.
That would be lovely.

10:34.587 --> 10:39.591
He would love that.
Wow, Ted's really dead.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.011
He looks so peaceful.
Why is that the desired

10:42.145 --> 10:44.763
adjective for a dead person?
Like, if I go down, I

10:44.898 --> 10:47.266
people to be, like, "That dude
looks like he's getting shit

10:47.400 --> 10:49.268
done, like he's getting laid and
he's getting paid."

10:49.402 --> 10:56.408
Okay, Ted... are you ready...
to draft?

10:56.526 --> 10:57.910
(whoops)
Yes.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.662
Let's do this.
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:59.779 --> 11:01.664
Did someone ask for a draft
board?

11:01.781 --> 11:03.666
All right.
Beer, anyone?

11:03.783 --> 11:05.167
Yeah, yeah.
Nice, Taco.

11:05.285 --> 11:06.725
Here you go.
One last draft with Ted.

11:06.786 --> 11:08.671
He would have wanted it this
way.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.172
Yeah.
We'll find someone to replace

11:10.290 --> 11:12.174
him in the league, but for now
we'll just take turns drafting

11:12.292 --> 11:17.096
for him. We are no longer sitting shiva.
We are now sitting Shiva

11:17.213 --> 11:24.103
(whoops) Gentlemen, I present to you
our 2014 draft board. All right.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.221
That's awesome.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, one

11:26.356 --> 11:30.642
more-- woop. That's an awful picture, babe.
Why is my mouth open?

11:30.810 --> 11:32.311
Well, empirical evidence
would point to you wanting to

11:32.479 --> 11:33.979
gargle Pete's pudding, but I
think, in this case, just

11:34.147 --> 11:35.981
looking for wins.
Oh. Can we please start the

11:36.149 --> 11:44.907
draft? The first pick-- Ted
selects Jamaal Charles. Okay.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.909
Oh. Cold.
(phone chimes)

11:47.043 --> 11:48.911
No. No, it's not a trade.
You're on the clock.

11:49.045 --> 11:51.045
I know. I'm on the six
different leagues right now,

11:51.064 --> 11:55.217
okay?
I'm gonna take Julia Jones.

11:55.335 --> 11:57.836
It's got to be tough being a
woman in the NFL.

11:57.971 --> 12:03.058
Beast Mode! Ted selects the Jacksonville
Jaguars defense for the third period.

12:03.176 --> 12:04.977
No, no, no.
Ruxin, have a little respect for

12:05.095 --> 12:07.679
the dead, please.
Give him Gary and Foster.

12:07.847 --> 12:09.681
Le'Veon Bell.
I don't even know which

12:09.849 --> 12:11.683
league you're talking about.
Let's get some LeGarrette

12:11.851 --> 12:13.685
"Blounts" up in here.
Let's get messed up.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.904
Taco, you can't get high off
a running back.

12:16.022 --> 12:17.990
Cheers, Ted.
Funeral draft!

12:18.108 --> 12:19.992
You know what's amazing is,
some people would find this

12:20.110 --> 12:21.994
disrespectful.
(Taco sputters)

12:22.112 --> 12:23.779
Ruxin, you're up on the clock.

12:23.913 --> 12:25.447
I'm not in the Marines, so I
don't know what that lingo

12:25.582 --> 12:27.533
means.
Cameron Jordan, okay?

12:27.667 --> 12:29.368
Cameron Jordan?
Yeah, Cameron Jordan.

12:29.502 --> 12:31.203
I think he said "Cameron
Jordan."

12:31.337 --> 12:33.205
Cameron Jordan?
He wants Cameron Jordan.

12:33.373 --> 12:35.207
Okay. Cameron Jordan?
Cameron Jordan.

12:35.375 --> 12:39.094
Right. Defensive end, New Orleans Saints.
Congratulations, Ruxin. Wha

12:39.212 --> 12:42.765
Good pick. No, no. Jordan Cameron, the
tight end for the Cleveland Browns.

12:42.882 --> 12:44.600
No, that's-that's not what
you said, right?

12:44.717 --> 12:46.602
Not what I heard.
I heard him say "Cameron."

12:46.719 --> 12:48.604
Ted?
Ted?

12:48.721 --> 12:50.272
Did he say "Cameron Jordan"?
Cameron Jordan, Jordan

12:50.390 --> 12:52.110
Cameron-- it's the same thing.
No, it's not.

12:52.225 --> 12:53.985
One of them's black, and one of
them's white.

12:54.060 --> 12:55.561
And one of them plays
defense, and one of them plays

12:55.695 --> 12:57.396
offense.
This is not my fault, okay?

12:57.530 --> 12:59.231
I'm in too many leagues right
now.

12:59.365 --> 13:00.899
Such an idiot.
I'll take Chad Ochocinco of the

13:01.034 --> 13:02.734
Montreal Alouettes. Boom!
Great choice.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.736
And in round 11, Russell Wilson.

13:04.904 --> 13:08.907
Go, Hawks.
(Taco inhales)

13:09.042 --> 13:13.078
Oh, yeah.
All right, hit it, Ted.

13:13.246 --> 13:15.080
There you go.
(knocking on door)

13:15.248 --> 13:17.082
Hello?
His parents are here.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.084
Oh.
What? Oh, my God.

13:19.252 --> 13:21.086
Uh.
(overlapping chatter)

13:21.254 --> 13:23.088
Um...
Hold on.

13:23.256 --> 13:29.645
Uh, we were just mourning.
Hello?!

13:29.762 --> 13:31.647
Come on.
Mmm.

13:31.764 --> 13:33.682
Can the shomers come to the
door, please?!

13:33.817 --> 13:35.567
Uh, coming. One second.
Okay.

13:35.685 --> 13:37.519
I am so, so...
Very.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.521
...so, so sorry. Shalom.
Shalom.

13:39.656 --> 13:41.523
Shalom.
Shalom.

13:41.658 --> 13:45.194
Shalom. We got a lot of noise complaints.
Did you hear anything?

13:45.328 --> 13:47.196
No. No.
No.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.914
Well, I'm glad you're still
here because we went through

13:49.032 --> 13:50.916
Ted's will.
Ted insisted in his will that

13:51.034 --> 13:52.918
you replace him before the
season starts.

13:53.036 --> 13:59.041
Oh. And he bequeathed one of you his
Laguna beach houses. Which one of us?

13:59.175 --> 14:03.178
Whoever wins the fantasy
football league this year.

14:03.296 --> 14:05.631
Oh.
Oh, wow.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.633
I can't believe we're playing
for a house.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.635
I know.
It's right on the ocean.

14:09.802 --> 14:13.639
Guys, it's amazing. Yeah, we've got stakes
to play for. This is huge. Oh, man.

14:13.806 --> 14:17.309
Whatever. You don't want a Laguna beach
house? Now that I know where the

14:17.477 --> 14:19.157
house is, I don't need to own it
to use it.

14:19.312 --> 14:20.979
All right, guys, let's just
go finish this draft.

14:21.147 --> 14:22.814
Okay.
Exactly. Who's got the board?

14:22.982 --> 14:24.650
I hid the board in the coffin
under Ted.

14:24.817 --> 14:26.485
What?
Why would you do that?

14:26.653 --> 14:30.155
Well, because if I hid it on him,
everyone would have seen it. Oh, Taco!

14:30.323 --> 14:31.990
You idiot!
Okay, let's everyone just go

14:32.158 --> 14:33.659
through your own picks, round by
round, and figure out who

14:33.826 --> 14:36.962
we have. For running backs, I
definitely had Peterson and Lynch.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.664
Oh, bullshit.
No, I drafted Lynch.

14:38.831 --> 14:39.915
No... What?
You did. You drafted David

14:40.049 --> 14:41.300
Lynch, I'm pretty sure.
Oh, come on, Ruxin!

14:41.417 --> 14:42.668
I know. This is crazy.
I definitely had Jordan

14:42.835 --> 14:44.169
Cameron.
That's the only thing I'm sure.

14:44.304 --> 14:45.170
Oh, come on.
No! No!

14:45.305 --> 14:47.005
Why do we have to argue?
You wrote it all down on the

14:47.140 --> 14:50.100
computer. I do it at the end when it's
all done. You were typing the entire

14:50.176 --> 14:52.563
time. I know. I was just doing research
for my draft. No! You have to...

14:52.683 --> 14:53.748
What are you talking about?!
What are you talking about?

14:53.868 --> 14:54.946
You are such an embarrassment,
Sacko.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.173
It's because of stupid shit like
this that everyone thinks that

14:57.279 --> 14:58.730
MacArthurs are idiots.
All I know is I drafted

14:58.864 --> 15:01.023
LeGarrette "Blounts," and I
never got him.

15:01.143 --> 15:02.694
I guess we should just redraft.

15:02.811 --> 15:04.345
(all saying "No!")
No way!

15:04.480 --> 15:06.014
I know what you're trying to
do here, okay? You're trying

15:06.148 --> 15:07.649
to get rid of your shitty team.
There's way too much on the line

15:07.766 --> 15:09.350
here with the beach house.
Yeah.

15:09.485 --> 15:12.445
So, what are we gonna do? We got to get
that draft board out of the coffin.

15:14.776 --> 15:16.644
I was looking over Ted's
will, and there was something

15:16.778 --> 15:19.621
very specific that he wanted us
to do.

15:19.741 --> 15:21.692
Yeah, sure. What?
Look, we all know how much

15:21.860 --> 15:23.694
Ted loved flash mobs, right?
Flash mobs? Uh...

15:23.862 --> 15:25.696
Yeah. Oh, Ted loved a good
flash mob.

15:25.864 --> 15:27.698
Flash mobs.
Fla... I thought you said

15:27.866 --> 15:29.786
something different.
Flash mobs. Yeah, of course.

15:29.868 --> 15:31.752
Flash mobs.
Mm-hmm, exactly.

15:31.870 --> 15:33.754
We did a flash mob today.
Well, Ted would like there to

15:33.872 --> 15:36.457
be a flash mob at his funeral.
Great idea. Beautiful, yeah.

15:36.592 --> 15:38.459
Beautiful celebration of life.

15:38.594 --> 15:41.295
Okay. Here's the plan.
Once the rabbi starts the

15:41.430 --> 15:43.297
mourner's kaddish, he wants you
to kick it off.

15:43.432 --> 15:45.432
Here's your outfit.
You put this on underneath your

15:45.434 --> 15:49.303
clothes. We've already got
ours on right now. Okay.

15:49.438 --> 15:51.305
Oh, wait a second. Wait.
Why do I have to start this?

15:51.440 --> 15:53.107
What are you talking about,
why you?

15:53.225 --> 15:55.026
You were always Ted's favorite.
He called you "the first among

15:55.143 --> 15:57.028
equals."
Well, I can't argue with Ted.

15:57.145 --> 15:59.030
I mean, he knows what he's
talking about.

15:59.147 --> 16:01.032
I'm gonna do this.
Ted would have wanted it this

16:01.149 --> 16:06.537
way. You guys really think you
can pull this off? Of course.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.539
It's gonna be great.
Hmm.

16:08.657 --> 16:10.541
Holy shit.
Look who came to Ted's funeral.

16:10.659 --> 16:12.543
It's Cameron Jordan and Jordan
Cameron.

16:12.661 --> 16:14.378
I wonder if Ruxin knows the
difference.

16:14.496 --> 16:16.380
Time to find out.
Excuse me. Hi.

16:16.498 --> 16:18.382
Jordan Cameron, right?
How you doing?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.384
Cameron Jordan.
Nice. Nice.

16:20.502 --> 16:22.053
They usually get us confused.
That's actually what I wanted

16:22.170 --> 16:25.723
to talk to you guys about. Would you
mind doing us a quick favor? BOTH: Sure.

16:25.841 --> 16:29.760
Hey, Ruxin.
Funniest thing happened on the

16:29.895 --> 16:32.647
way to the funeral.
We met a guy you drafted.

16:32.764 --> 16:34.682
You should say hello to the
person you drafted.

16:34.816 --> 16:36.684
Yeah. What's up, man?
How you doing?

16:36.818 --> 16:38.738
Cleveland Browns tight end.
Yeah. What's my name?

16:38.820 --> 16:40.738
What's my name?
(laughing): What's my...?

16:40.856 --> 16:42.740
No, what's really...
what's-what's my name?

16:42.858 --> 16:44.742
Dude, what's my name, bro?
Rodney.

16:44.860 --> 16:46.744
Rodney.
What's mine? Mine?

16:46.862 --> 16:48.746
Dude, your name.
Come on, bro.

16:48.864 --> 16:50.748
I drafted you, bro.
You drafted me.

16:50.866 --> 16:52.750
You got to know my name.
I drafted...

16:52.868 --> 16:54.585
Who did you draft?
I... I'll tell you who I

16:54.703 --> 16:56.420
drafted.
I drafted a Pro Bowl player.

16:56.538 --> 16:57.978
You made the Pro Bowl?
Yeah. Did you?

16:58.123 --> 16:59.340
I made the Pro Bowl.
Oh, you're both in the

16:59.458 --> 17:00.624
Pro Bowl.
(Ruxin clears his throat)

17:00.759 --> 17:02.460
That's cool.
Tell the bro his name.

17:02.594 --> 17:04.095
It's like we're all bros
here. You know what I mean?

17:04.212 --> 17:05.930
We're all here for Ted.
Ted's our dude.

17:06.048 --> 17:07.765
Ted would know who he drafted.

17:07.883 --> 17:09.767
Jordan Cameron.
Hmm.

17:09.885 --> 17:11.769
Which one did you point to?
Wait a minute.

17:11.887 --> 17:13.604
It seemed like you weren't
really specific.

17:13.722 --> 17:15.606
Come on, man.
What's my name?

17:15.723 --> 17:17.608
Cameron Jordan.
No.

17:17.726 --> 17:19.609
Oh.
So, you did draft me?

17:19.728 --> 17:23.396
Yup. So your league must have IDPs.
Is that an individual...?

17:23.531 --> 17:25.398
Individual defensive players.
We play with those, Kevin?

17:25.534 --> 17:27.401
No, we do not.
See, that's the even crazier

17:27.536 --> 17:30.705
part of all this, is that I was,
like, "We <i> should</i> do IDP because

17:30.822 --> 17:33.908
individual defense players are
not recognized enough."

17:34.042 --> 17:35.910
No, that's the opposite of
what you said.

17:36.044 --> 17:37.912
You were adamant about drafting
one shit-sipping defense and

17:38.046 --> 17:39.914
moving on with it.
Direct quote.

17:40.048 --> 17:41.916
Hmm.
Ouch.

17:42.050 --> 17:45.970
Aah! Just got IDP'd.
Oh!

17:46.088 --> 17:47.972
Hey, J.J. Watt.
No shit.

17:48.090 --> 17:49.974
Hi.
Hi. Remember us?

17:50.092 --> 17:51.976
Hi. Yeah, yeah.
How you been?

17:52.094 --> 17:53.811
You cost me $900 of my
mini-bar last year.

17:53.929 --> 17:55.596
Yeah.
Yup, that sure was me.

17:55.731 --> 17:57.431
So good to see you.
We're friends.

17:57.566 --> 17:59.100
How's Arian Foster?
How's the knee?

17:59.234 --> 18:00.874
Yeah, how is he?
We're-we're at a funeral.

18:00.902 --> 18:02.436
That's very inappropriate.
How's Clowney working in the

18:02.571 --> 18:04.271
three-four?
Guys, are we here to pay our

18:04.406 --> 18:05.940
respects to Ted, or are we here
to talk fantasy football?

18:06.074 --> 18:07.775
We ...are here to pay our
respects to Ted.

18:07.909 --> 18:09.610
Thank you.
Between you and me, though,

18:09.745 --> 18:13.614
DeAndre Hopkins, right? Wrong. Not the
time, nor the place. Hello? Shalom?

18:13.749 --> 18:16.367
Guys.
Everyone please be seated.

18:16.501 --> 18:20.538
The ceremony is about to begin. Oh...
Welcome to a celebration of life.

18:20.672 --> 18:22.632
We will begin the memorial...
Ah, it's really sad.

18:22.674 --> 18:24.542
I'm always secretly happy
when good-looking people die.

18:24.676 --> 18:28.929
Oh, God, full of compassion,
Thou Who dwellest on high,

18:29.047 --> 18:32.383
grant perfect rest beneath the
sheltering wings of Thy

18:32.551 --> 18:34.385
presence...
It's gonna be so great!

18:34.553 --> 18:36.387
Bye-bye, Teflondre.
Where's Taco?

18:36.555 --> 18:39.356
Think he's trying to get a
round in.

18:42.644 --> 18:48.199
(whistling) We will now read from Psalm
23... Hey, babe, I know we're still

18:48.316 --> 18:51.402
in the middle of it, but you are
drafting really well.

18:51.536 --> 18:53.404
Can you not mess with me
right now, please?

18:53.538 --> 18:58.409
Are you kidding me? You got Shady McCoy,
Doug Martin and Drew Brees. Yeah.

18:58.543 --> 19:00.411
"...on paths of righteousness
for His glory.

19:00.545 --> 19:02.413
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of dea..."

19:02.547 --> 19:04.467
I got movement down there.
"...I fear no harm..."

19:04.549 --> 19:06.417
Really?
We got blood flow.

19:06.551 --> 19:10.254
Mm. Yeah, tell me more about my middle
rounds. Julius Thomas-- brilliant

19:10.422 --> 19:14.258
pickup, yeah. Yes, yes, yes, I know,
I know, oh. Babe, I got roster wood.

19:14.426 --> 19:17.678
I got roster wood.
Let's do this now. Let's go.

19:17.813 --> 19:19.680
What? We're at a funeral.
I don't know when he's gonna

19:19.815 --> 19:21.682
come back, okay?
Look, Ted would have wanted it

19:21.817 --> 19:25.820
this way. ...and may his
soul be bound up... Okay.

19:25.937 --> 19:27.655
All right. Um, we have to get
something out of the car.

19:27.772 --> 19:29.657
Oh, you forgot the Sacko?
May the Lord be his

19:29.774 --> 19:32.409
possession, and may he rest in
peace.

19:32.527 --> 19:37.948
Amen. We will now read the mourner's
kaddish. Glorified and sanctified be

19:38.083 --> 19:40.563
God's great name throughout the
world, which He has created and

19:40.619 --> 19:42.870
according to His will, may He
establish...

19:43.004 --> 19:46.173
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
This one's for Ted!

19:46.291 --> 19:51.428

20:15.370 --> 20:17.788
Ted's high school friends are
the worst.

20:17.906 --> 20:21.325
All right, that's 200 yards
to the green.

20:23.161 --> 20:26.463
Aw! Shanked it!
Here, come, come on.

20:26.581 --> 20:28.966
Flash mob.
Andre, this is a funeral.

20:29.084 --> 20:35.222
Have some respect.
And break.

20:40.095 --> 20:43.314
(rabbi gasps, groans)
Oh, my God!

20:43.431 --> 20:48.769
He's unconscious. Isn't there a doctor
in the house? Yeah, I-I'm a doctor.

20:48.904 --> 20:50.771
Okay, I need some ice, a cold
compress and some hydrogen

20:50.906 --> 20:54.775
peroxide. He's gonna save this guy's life.
That's pretty impressive.

20:54.910 --> 20:56.777
I didn't know Andre had it in
him.

20:56.912 --> 20:59.697
No, no, no!
BOTH: Teflondre.

21:00.906 --> 21:04.106
Jesus Christ.
The worst funeral ever.

21:04.218 --> 21:06.102
Well, I'll see you there.
All right, great.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.021
Well, we'll definitely have
dinner then.

21:08.139 --> 21:10.023
Goddamn Teflondre.
It's crazy.

21:10.141 --> 21:12.025
What did I miss, boys?
Oh, just Ted's funeral.

21:12.143 --> 21:13.944
Where were you?
Brutal day on the links.

21:14.061 --> 21:15.862
Not as brutal as it was in
there.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.900
But you know what?
It is time for Operation Draft

21:17.982 --> 21:19.866
Board.
Where the hell's Kevin?

21:19.984 --> 21:21.868
I don't care where Kevin is.
All right, here's the thing.

21:21.986 --> 21:23.870
We're the pallbearers, right?
BOTH: Mm-hmm.

21:23.988 --> 21:25.538
So, we grab the coffin, we
run around behind the building.

21:25.656 --> 21:27.374
Mm-hmm.
Put it down for a second,

21:27.491 --> 21:29.042
pull out the draft board, close
it up, get back in line.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.044
Nobody's the wiser.
Great.

21:31.162 --> 21:32.712
Just for the record, I think
it was a terrible idea to put

21:32.830 --> 21:34.547
the draft board in the coffin.
Duly noted.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.383
Duly noted.
Oh, we got this right here.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.385
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

21:38.502 --> 21:40.220
Thank you so much.
No, we got it.

21:40.338 --> 21:41.888
We got it. We got it.
Oh, uh, what are you doing?

21:42.006 --> 21:43.673
We're pallbearers, too.
Oh... cool.

21:43.808 --> 21:47.510
Oh. Um... Uh, it's cool, Cameron.
We got it.

21:47.645 --> 21:49.512
J-Jordan.
It's Cam.

21:49.647 --> 21:51.514
Right, Cam. We know...
Jordan.

21:51.649 --> 21:53.350
Jordan.
Listen, Cameron, we got this.

21:53.484 --> 21:55.185
It's okay.
Uh, what he means to say is,

21:55.319 --> 21:58.905
maybe if I go on this side, and then...
Mm-hmm. And then what would happen?

21:59.023 --> 22:00.690
If you guys back up for a
second...

22:00.825 --> 22:02.158
And then maybe you guys could
And then they would come in.

22:02.276 --> 22:03.243
come on this side...
Right, and then we

22:03.361 --> 22:05.041
would just...
And then, I think we just go!

22:06.030 --> 22:07.697
Did they just steal the coffin?

22:07.865 --> 22:09.366
Should we go get it?
No. I'm giving them a 50-yard

22:09.533 --> 22:12.369
head start.
In there, in there.

22:12.536 --> 22:14.371
It's a closet.
Here?

22:14.538 --> 22:16.373
What?
No!

22:16.540 --> 22:20.210
Oh, God! Oh, oh, oh, what are you doing?
What-what are <i> you</i> doing?!

22:20.378 --> 22:22.045
Oh, we're grieving in our
own special way.

22:22.213 --> 22:23.880
What does it look like we're
doing?

22:24.048 --> 22:25.548
It looks like you're having
really said, middle-aged sex.

22:25.716 --> 22:27.550
But clearly, you wouldn't do
that in a morgue.

22:27.718 --> 22:29.552
I had roster wood.
From that shitty lineup?

22:29.720 --> 22:32.605
She likes it.
It was okay.

22:32.723 --> 22:34.607
Guys, what's going on here?
In front of Ted?!

22:34.725 --> 22:38.778
Can you guys not be morons for
one day?

22:39.730 --> 22:42.148
Get it together!
Come on, Ted.

22:42.283 --> 22:44.150
Looks like we got to redraft,
huh?

22:44.285 --> 22:46.152
Uh, no.
No, no.

22:46.287 --> 22:52.325
I don't think so. No, that... This
is a final... Oh, that's Ted.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.744
If that is Ted, who is in the
coffin?

22:54.879 --> 22:56.999
Ted Rappaport was a great
man, and he was loyal to his

22:57.131 --> 23:01.001
friends. Even friends that weren't
so great. But now, Ted, we must say

23:01.135 --> 23:03.003
good-bye.
I got it!

23:03.137 --> 23:05.005
(Taco whoops, laughs)
My God.

23:05.139 --> 23:07.007
(people gasp and scream)
Oh, my God.

23:07.141 --> 23:09.009
What is going on?
Oh, don't worry.

23:09.143 --> 23:11.011
It's just a draft.
Ted's still dead.

23:11.145 --> 23:12.929
