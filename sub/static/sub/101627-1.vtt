02:30.867 --> 02:32.634
No, the problem with Derek
is that he talks a better game

02:32.701 --> 02:33.870
than he plays. Just..

02:33.937 --> 02:35.939
Yeah, hang on.

02:36.006 --> 02:38.074
He's still emailing me.

02:38.141 --> 02:40.709
Yeah, can you call him? We
really got to get on the road.

02:40.776 --> 02:42.078
Yeah, the new house.

02:42.145 --> 02:43.846
- What's in the bag, mommy?
- Money.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.181
- Really?
- Oh.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.983
No, sweetheart,
mommy's on the phone.

02:47.050 --> 02:49.486
Yeah, no, he smells money,
but he's got nothing to offer.

02:49.551 --> 02:52.255
- Okay, everybody in the car.
- Everybody in the car!

02:52.322 --> 02:53.990
- Everybody in the car!
- 'Everybody in the car!'

02:54.057 --> 02:55.691
- Everybody in the car.
- Okay.. Okay, okay.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.027
- Can we not shout it?
- Everybody in the car.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.727
- Everybody in the car!
- Shh! Shh!

02:58.794 --> 03:01.830
Everybody in the car!
Everybody in the car!

03:01.898 --> 03:04.034
Shh!

03:04.100 --> 03:08.938
Okay, yeah, everybody,
we really need to go. Okay.

03:09.005 --> 03:11.341
Is David still in the house?

03:11.408 --> 03:12.741
Yes, Mrs. Cashman.

03:12.808 --> 03:14.610
Rose, please. Call me Hannah.

03:14.676 --> 03:16.745
"Mrs. Cashman" sounds so old

03:16.812 --> 03:19.282
and I'm just not ready
to go there yet.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.717
Okay, Hannah.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.987
He's talking to Alicia?

03:24.054 --> 03:25.554
Yeah.

03:26.256 --> 03:27.924
God help him.

03:27.991 --> 03:30.026
Why can't I just stay here?

03:30.093 --> 03:32.728
All my friends are in town.
I'm old enough.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.596
- No and no. Come on.
- Ugh.

03:34.663 --> 03:36.433
Uh, no hands, please?

03:36.499 --> 03:38.201
Prisoners have rights, too.

03:44.773 --> 03:45.875
So how's she doing?

03:45.942 --> 03:48.178
She'll be okay.

03:48.244 --> 03:51.247
She just really wanted to spend
Christmas with her mother.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.083
Yeah, well, speaking of exes

03:53.149 --> 03:55.318
their father didn't even bother
to bring presents.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.987
Said it was <i>too commercial.</i>

- Now, please.
- What?

05:54.703 --> 05:56.339
I didn't shout dog balls.

05:56.406 --> 05:59.042
This is a family trip and
we should spend it as a family

just say "Balls?"

06:28.638 --> 06:31.174

Greetings, Cashman family!

07:11.047 --> 07:13.349
Be careful up there, Emmett.

07:16.619 --> 07:18.354
- Okay.
- Who's that?

07:18.421 --> 07:21.124
- 'That is Emmett.'
- And he's our contractor.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.893
He's been working
on making the house livable.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.763
I thought you said
this was a family holiday.

07:26.828 --> 07:29.632
This <i>is</i> a family holiday.

07:31.234 --> 07:34.304
Gee, dad,
why didn't you tell me we were going

07:34.370 --> 07:37.707
to a condemned building
in the middle of nowhere?

07:37.774 --> 07:40.009
I wouldn't have been
so reluctant.

07:40.076 --> 07:43.046
Now listen,
it may not look like much now

07:43.112 --> 07:45.948
but you have to see past
all of this.

07:46.015 --> 07:49.218
You have to envision
what it can become.

07:49.285 --> 07:51.888
'For example,
I can see a weekend getaway'

07:51.954 --> 07:53.456
'for a tech billionaire.'

07:53.523 --> 07:57.493
'It's a few hours north of the
city, near all the ski resorts'

07:57.560 --> 08:00.229
and it comes
with a big, fat price tag.

08:00.296 --> 08:01.998
Oh, yeah.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.901
Well, I think it's beautiful.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.469
It will be.

08:06.536 --> 08:09.272
It has all the potential
that it needs.

08:09.339 --> 08:12.909
We just have
to breathe life into it.

08:12.975 --> 08:14.677
- Okay.
- Hey, come on.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.479
Let's go inside, guys.

08:30.626 --> 08:34.197
You know, she's right.
It doesn't look like much.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.333
Alicia, you know
this is all for you, right?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.936
Your parents have put
everything they have into this.

08:40.002 --> 08:41.871
How much did they pay you
to say that?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.340
Just tell me, we can split it.

08:44.407 --> 08:46.342
Oh, you're awful.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.544
- And the heat's on?
- Yup. The water, too.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.645
Okay, perfect.

08:49.712 --> 08:51.214
Okay, everybody.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.449
Gather around,
this is important.

08:54.884 --> 08:57.120
Alright. Everybody, listen up.

08:57.186 --> 08:59.489
This is a beautiful house,
but it's old

08:59.555 --> 09:02.492
so there are parts
that are unsafe.

09:02.558 --> 09:05.695
So for now,
second floor is safe

09:05.762 --> 09:07.563
first floor is safe.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.098
Everyone got that?

09:09.165 --> 09:11.567
That means no one,
under any circumstances

09:11.634 --> 09:13.136
goes up to the third floor.

09:13.202 --> 09:15.204
The third floor is not safe.

09:15.271 --> 09:18.508
Zoe, Franklin, Alicia? Okay?

09:18.574 --> 09:19.642
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.177
What's the Wi-Fi?

09:21.244 --> 09:24.882
Oh, there's no Wi-Fi
or phones. Sorry.

09:24.947 --> 09:27.817
Is there food
or should I set up some traps

09:27.885 --> 09:29.318
and try to bag a squirrel
for dinner?

09:29.385 --> 09:31.521
Funny, sweetie.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.822
There better be a TV.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.390
I'll get your stuff.

09:40.463 --> 09:42.465
Um, everything okay?

09:42.532 --> 09:43.633
Guys?

09:45.435 --> 09:49.172
What if Santa
doesn't give us our presents?

09:49.238 --> 09:51.541
They're worried Santa won't know
they are up here

09:51.607 --> 09:53.609
and he won't bring their toys
for Christmas.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.379
Well, that is not true.
Is it, dad?

09:56.446 --> 09:57.780
Absolutely not.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.216
Santa always knows where
the good boys and girls are

10:00.283 --> 10:04.620
and he always gets them their
gifts on Christmas Eve. Always.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.222
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:06.289 --> 10:07.990
I'll get these guys settled in.

10:08.057 --> 10:10.726
Who wants to see
their new bedrooms?

10:10.793 --> 10:11.961
- I do!
- Okay, let's go.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.897
Um, you know what?
I can take them.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.599
Yeah, um,
and while we're upstairs

10:16.666 --> 10:20.102
maybe you can bring in
the G-I-F-T-S.

10:20.169 --> 10:22.238
- Yes, Mrs. Cashman.
- Oh, it's Hannah.

10:22.305 --> 10:23.539
Mrs. Cashman makes me
sound like..

10:23.606 --> 10:26.175
'An evil stepmother?'

10:27.677 --> 10:30.246
Come on, guys, you're gonna love
your room so much, huh?

10:30.313 --> 10:31.781
- Hannah?
- Yeah?

10:31.848 --> 10:34.784
- Can you come here a minute?
- Well, I'm just, I...

10:34.852 --> 10:37.086
It will just take a second.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.457
Okay, um.. Yeah.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.161
Okay, guys.
Let's go see that room.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.602
- Hannah?
- Yeah.

11:37.881 --> 11:39.715
Run.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.755
What? What do you want?

11:45.821 --> 11:48.724
'Franklin,
come check out your room.'

11:49.792 --> 11:51.327
Freak.

12:10.013 --> 12:11.213
Rose.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.281
Do you think there's anything

12:12.348 --> 12:14.317
messed up about this house?

12:14.383 --> 12:15.886
We all know how you feel.

12:15.953 --> 12:17.286
No, but look, I found this toy

12:17.353 --> 12:18.387
and it was just sitting there...

12:18.454 --> 12:20.489
Well, that's not
so weird, is it?

12:20.556 --> 12:23.060
This was a children's hospital.
There's bound to be stuff.

12:23.125 --> 12:26.128
No, I was walking
into this empty room

12:26.195 --> 12:28.164
turned around, and it was there.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.432
- Alicia.
- I swear, I saw...

12:29.498 --> 12:31.100
- Alicia!
- Listen to me.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.403
Alicia, everyone knows
you don't want to be here.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.405
You've made
your feelings clear.

12:36.472 --> 12:38.407
And I know it must be difficult
to be the child

12:38.474 --> 12:41.210
from the first marriage
stuck in the second.

12:41.277 --> 12:44.948
But things happen in life
that are beyond our control.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.885
No amount of anger or raging
at the sky is gonna change it.

12:50.286 --> 12:53.289
You have to find a way
to make peace with it

12:53.356 --> 12:55.558
or it will destroy you.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.794
Okay, Rose. Okay.

13:02.598 --> 13:07.871
You will survive Christmas
in the mountains. I promise.

13:29.759 --> 13:31.260
Well, this is hell.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.044
Oh, no.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.180
<i>Run.</i>

14:23.245 --> 14:24.714
Sorry?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.215
What?

14:26.282 --> 14:27.383
Didn't you just say..

14:31.754 --> 14:33.255
We scared you!

14:33.322 --> 14:34.858
Oh, my.

14:34.925 --> 14:37.194
Yes. Yes, you did.

14:37.259 --> 14:38.761
What are you creeps doing?

14:38.828 --> 14:40.296
I thought
you were with your mom.

14:40.362 --> 14:43.632
We were, but she started
doing work stuff.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.602
Hm. Mother of the year
strikes again.

14:50.372 --> 14:52.241
I love her.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.344
Her name's Bee Sharp.

14:57.279 --> 14:59.883
'Are there other toys here?'

15:13.029 --> 15:15.831
This is mine. I'm a raptor.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.666
Terrifying.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.769
Uncle Monkey!

15:19.835 --> 15:21.370
Kid Crock!

15:21.437 --> 15:22.571
And Rusty.

15:22.638 --> 15:24.141
How do you know that show?

15:24.207 --> 15:25.841
Dad showed it to me.

15:25.909 --> 15:27.077
"I am Kid Crock!

15:27.144 --> 15:29.712
The world's most muscular boy!"

15:34.416 --> 15:37.553
Y. Yak. Y.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.056
Okay, guys, let's unpack.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.668
Hey, you don't want to bring
those dirty old things, do you?

15:52.735 --> 15:55.404
'Santa's coming
with brand-new toys.'

15:57.840 --> 15:59.642
Guys?

15:59.708 --> 16:00.877
Hello?

16:25.467 --> 16:27.103
Back to our rooms.

16:56.699 --> 17:00.303
Hey. Are you still mad at me?

17:00.402 --> 17:02.538
Do you know how to set this up?

17:02.605 --> 17:04.007
Do I know how to set this up?

17:04.074 --> 17:07.310
Girl,
you are talking to the man.

17:07.376 --> 17:09.511
Come on. Let me do this.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.582
Let me see here.

17:15.051 --> 17:18.889
Uh, so Emmett said

17:18.955 --> 17:22.092
he found this whole set-up
in the garage

17:22.158 --> 17:24.961
with a bunch of old toys.

17:25.028 --> 17:28.530
This must be how
cavemen played video games.

17:28.597 --> 17:32.835
Alright. Uh-huh, and that..

17:36.472 --> 17:39.042
Wow! Hi-tech.

17:39.109 --> 17:41.344
See?

17:41.410 --> 17:44.114
And you wanted
to stay home alone.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.216
<i>I</i> wanted to stay with mom.

17:46.283 --> 17:48.417
Look, I know.

17:48.484 --> 17:52.122
But your mom and I,
we have a system

17:52.188 --> 17:55.658
and that system works,
so we stick to the system.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.361
You could make an exception.

17:58.427 --> 18:00.796
Look, you're going to be
going off to college

18:00.864 --> 18:03.166
in a couple of years,
and I want to spend

18:03.233 --> 18:06.769
as much time as I can with you
before you become too cool

18:06.835 --> 18:09.239
to spend some time
with your old man.

18:09.306 --> 18:11.174
So I made plans for us.

18:11.241 --> 18:13.877
And your mom, well,
she made her own.

18:13.944 --> 18:16.478
- Yeah! She's in Bora Bora.
- Bora Bora.

18:16.545 --> 18:18.248
Yes. I know.

18:18.315 --> 18:20.482
Beautiful, tropical Bora Bora.

18:20.549 --> 18:22.518
With Graham.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.687
Meanwhile, you're stuck here
with your awful father

18:24.753 --> 18:28.258
wicked stepmother
and her two evil little children

18:28.325 --> 18:32.195
playing a caveman's video game.

18:32.262 --> 18:34.097
You know what I mean.

18:34.164 --> 18:37.466
I know. I'm being greedy.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.203
I just want to be around you
whenever I can.

18:42.138 --> 18:45.741
Now, here's something
my parents never said to me.

18:45.808 --> 18:48.811
Why don't you go play
some video games, kiddo?

18:50.213 --> 18:52.349
Hey. I love you.

18:57.854 --> 18:59.856
'I just think we play it
safe, Hannah.'

18:59.923 --> 19:02.725
- Throw a brace on all of it.
- Are they that bad?

19:02.791 --> 19:05.996
They'll be flagged on inspection
for sure.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.631
Okay. But do we have that money
in the budget?

19:09.698 --> 19:11.935
No, David,
there's not money in the budget.

19:12.002 --> 19:13.802
Okay, so where are we
gonna find it?

19:13.870 --> 19:16.172
Every house this size
has secrets.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.108
- We encounter it every time.
- I know.

19:18.174 --> 19:20.642
But it's just this is the
biggest swing we've ever taken.

19:20.709 --> 19:21.978
- Yup.
- And if we don't...

19:22.045 --> 19:23.545
Stop! No.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.615
There's no, "If we don't."

19:26.682 --> 19:28.650
This is the biggest swing
we've ever taken

19:28.717 --> 19:30.286
and it's going to get us
the biggest paycheck

19:30.353 --> 19:33.256
we've ever gotten. The end.

19:33.323 --> 19:34.357
Yes, ma'am.

19:35.624 --> 19:37.894
Okay, you laugh, but I mean it.

19:37.961 --> 19:40.696
Let's get to work. Chop-chop.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.368
- Well, so I.. I'm coming.
- 'David?'

19:45.435 --> 19:46.970
Better you than me, buddy.

19:50.073 --> 19:51.041
Okay.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:54.576 --> 19:56.880
So in addition
to everything else

19:56.946 --> 19:58.982
tomorrow is Christmas Eve
and this place

19:59.049 --> 20:02.519
does not look like it.
So, we gotta move.

20:02.584 --> 20:05.055
Okay. Got it.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.689
- Did you talk to Alicia?
- Oh. Yeah.

20:07.756 --> 20:10.260
And she is definitely angry
with her mother

20:10.326 --> 20:13.229
but she would never give me
that satisfaction and admit it.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.232
Well, I don't blame her, okay?
I'd love to be in Bora Bora too.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.535
Well, her mother
didn't invite her.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.838
So she's taking it out on us
because she's..

20:22.906 --> 20:26.142
- She's 15.
- She's 15.

20:26.209 --> 20:29.312
Well, you know what,
we are going to give this family

20:29.379 --> 20:32.248
the best Christmas
they've ever had, right here.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.186
Here, in 24 hours?

20:36.252 --> 20:37.520
That's all the time we need.

20:37.586 --> 20:38.787
And then we're going
to restore this house

20:38.855 --> 20:41.157
and make it perfect, too.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.293
We can do it, David.

20:45.694 --> 20:47.130
What the..

21:04.581 --> 21:06.382
Hey, settle down up there!

21:06.449 --> 21:08.885
And quit throwing stuff around!

21:12.122 --> 21:13.722
Yuck.

21:13.789 --> 21:15.824
It's Uncle Monkey.

21:15.892 --> 21:17.626
You don't know
who Uncle Monkey is?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.661
No. Should I know
who Uncle Monkey is?

21:19.728 --> 21:22.565
It's a cartoon
from my childhood.

21:22.631 --> 21:25.401
♪ Uncle Monkey
Uncle Monkey ♪

21:25.468 --> 21:28.505
♪ He's your father's brother
who's a monkey ♪♪

21:28.571 --> 21:29.873
Wow!

21:29.939 --> 21:31.608
Has anyone told you
you just have

21:31.673 --> 21:34.077
a beautiful singing voice?

21:34.144 --> 21:36.712
- No.
- Hm, interesting.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.690
Die, die, die!

21:51.060 --> 21:53.329
World War I was easy.

23:15.545 --> 23:19.682
"'Will you walk into my parlor?'
said the spider to the fly

23:19.748 --> 23:24.287
"'Tis the prettiest little
parlor that ever you did spy.

23:24.354 --> 23:28.324
"The way into my parlor
is up the winding stair

23:28.391 --> 23:32.662
"and I have many pretty things
to show when you are there.

23:32.729 --> 23:38.468
"'Oh, no, no, ' said the little
fly, 'To ask me is in vain

23:38.534 --> 23:41.170
"'for who goes up
your winding stair

23:41.237 --> 23:43.606
"'can ne'er come down again.

23:43.673 --> 23:48.878
'"I'm sure you must be weary,
dear, with soaring up so high.'

23:48.945 --> 23:51.114
"'Will you rest
upon my little bed?''

23:51.180 --> 23:53.416
'said the spider to the fly.."'

24:45.368 --> 24:46.969
Are you okay?

24:49.305 --> 24:50.940
Get out of here, Franklin.

24:51.007 --> 24:53.142
Get out of my room. Now!

24:55.244 --> 24:57.980
Thank you. Thank you.

25:08.191 --> 25:10.360
I see daddy
gave you his monkey.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.863
We found him first.
Then he ran away.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.264
Where did you find him?

25:15.331 --> 25:19.235
In the magic toy box.
In the playroom.

25:19.302 --> 25:21.070
It's very sad in there.

25:21.137 --> 25:23.573
Alicia almost died.

25:23.639 --> 25:25.241
No thanks to you, loser.

25:25.308 --> 25:27.810
- What?
- Nothing.

25:27.877 --> 25:29.245
I'm fine.

25:35.184 --> 25:38.221
They're going to get you.

25:41.057 --> 25:44.193
They're going to get you.

25:45.261 --> 25:48.131
They're going to get you.

25:55.738 --> 25:57.573
'I don't
like brushing my teeth.'

25:57.640 --> 25:58.608
I do.

25:58.674 --> 25:59.642
You have to brush your teeth

25:59.709 --> 26:00.843
to get rid of the sugar bugs.

26:00.910 --> 26:02.478
- I don't have sugar bugs.
- No.

26:02.545 --> 26:05.648
Because you brushed your teeth,
but if you don't

26:05.715 --> 26:07.016
the sugar bugs come out!

26:08.217 --> 26:09.819
Sugar bugs! Sugar bugs!
Sugar bugs!

26:10.920 --> 26:13.823
Oh, no! It's the tickle monster!

26:13.891 --> 26:16.092
This isn't the tickle monster.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.727
These are sugar bugs.

26:17.794 --> 26:19.429
Yeah, dad, get it right.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.963
Oh. My bad.

26:22.298 --> 26:24.400
Babes, um, Renee's on the phone.

26:24.467 --> 26:27.170
- 'It's about the permits.'
- Ugh. Can you?

26:27.236 --> 26:29.272
Well, she needs to talk
to us both.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.541
She's literally
getting on the plane.

26:31.607 --> 26:34.912
'And who knows how long
this phone reception will last.'

26:34.977 --> 26:38.448
Mommy, I want a story.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.316
Oh.

26:40.383 --> 26:42.718
Well, I can read them a story.

26:45.254 --> 26:47.256
Alright. Yeah, okay.

26:47.323 --> 26:50.526
One story and then bed, okay?

26:51.260 --> 26:53.162
I love you, guys.

26:53.229 --> 26:55.364
- I love you, too, mommy.
- I love you, too, mommy.

26:58.968 --> 27:01.270
Let's go
literally hop on this call.

27:01.337 --> 27:03.506
- Okay.
- Sorry, babe.

27:06.910 --> 27:10.346
Okay. Ready?

27:11.481 --> 27:13.449
As promised.

27:13.516 --> 27:15.418
"'Twas the night
before Christmas

27:15.485 --> 27:19.489
"and all through the house
not a creature was stirring

27:19.555 --> 27:20.590
not even a mo..."

27:20.656 --> 27:22.860
What's stirring mean?

27:22.926 --> 27:24.794
It means to move around.

27:24.862 --> 27:26.529
So everybody was asleep.

27:26.596 --> 27:29.098
- I knew what it meant.
- Did not!

27:29.165 --> 27:30.733
- Did, too!
- Guys.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.102
Just once I want to get through
the whole story

27:33.169 --> 27:37.573
without being interrupted.
Okay? Just once.

27:37.640 --> 27:41.143
What's a children's home?

27:41.210 --> 27:45.281
A children's home is what
they used to call a hospital

27:45.348 --> 27:46.917
where they only helped children.

27:46.984 --> 27:49.585
Is your baby
in a children's home?

27:50.921 --> 27:52.121
What?

27:52.188 --> 27:53.289
Mommy said you had a baby

27:53.356 --> 27:55.358
and something happened.

27:56.225 --> 27:59.729
No. No, sweetheart.

28:01.097 --> 28:04.902
I got sick,
and she was never born.

28:04.968 --> 28:07.470
'Sometimes that happens.'

28:07.537 --> 28:09.472
I'm sorry, Rose.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.577
Oh. That's okay.

28:14.644 --> 28:19.115
Because then I moved here
and I met you.

28:21.484 --> 28:22.986
So..

28:25.254 --> 28:27.290
"'Twas the night

Hello?

33:56.485 --> 33:57.820
Hello?

34:02.025 --> 34:04.160
Hello?

34:23.646 --> 34:25.282
Is everything okay?

34:25.348 --> 34:26.682
Rose?

34:28.318 --> 34:30.020
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34:30.086 --> 34:33.089
I tho.. I thought
I heard something

34:33.156 --> 34:34.723
and then, I-I don't know.

34:34.790 --> 34:38.094
Must have been a bird,
got into the house.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.628
Uh, David?

34:39.695 --> 34:41.830
Uh, okay, I'll go check.

34:43.599 --> 34:46.535
- Everything okay?
- I-I think so.

34:46.602 --> 34:49.605
- What happened?
- 'I don't see anything.'

34:49.672 --> 34:51.408
I mean, it must have went out
however it came in

34:51.473 --> 34:53.944
but we'll check tomorrow,
though.

34:54.010 --> 34:56.679
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

34:56.745 --> 34:59.448
It just surprised me. I'm okay.

34:59.515 --> 35:01.650
We should all go back to bed.

35:02.451 --> 35:04.254
Yeah, if you're sure.

35:04.321 --> 35:06.588
I'm sure. I'm fine.

35:10.726 --> 35:12.461
Hey, come on.

35:25.241 --> 35:28.477
You okay? Really?

35:28.544 --> 35:30.146
No.

35:31.847 --> 35:34.050
What did you mean before
about the house?

35:34.117 --> 35:35.952
When you found that toy.

35:37.653 --> 35:40.256
I thought I saw something.

35:40.323 --> 35:41.790
A little kid.

35:41.858 --> 35:43.659
I definitely heard one.

35:43.726 --> 35:46.262
- It said, "Run."
- Run.

35:48.431 --> 35:50.133
I was looking it up
on the drive.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.268
There's not much,
but I saved it.

35:52.335 --> 35:55.537
"St. Germaine's Children's
Clinic was established in 1918

35:55.604 --> 35:58.408
"near Mount Baker, for a time,
one of the primary sources

35:58.475 --> 36:01.878
"for children's medical care
in northern Washington State.

36:01.945 --> 36:03.913
It closed its doors
abruptly when.."

36:06.682 --> 36:09.419
That's it. But why abruptly?

36:09.486 --> 36:10.887
What happened?

36:12.055 --> 36:14.357
That's all it says?

36:14.424 --> 36:17.494
Well, Hannah bought the house.

36:17.559 --> 36:20.030
She had to have researched it.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.531
If there was anything
worth knowing..

36:22.598 --> 36:24.234
She would know.

37:03.306 --> 37:07.911
Guys, after breakfast let's get
bundled up and go outside, okay?

37:13.983 --> 37:16.319
Will one of you
please talk to me?

37:35.105 --> 37:37.639
What's with
Wednesday and Pugsley?

37:37.706 --> 37:40.143
They haven't spoken all morning.

37:40.210 --> 37:43.246
I took the toys away from them
last night.

37:43.313 --> 37:45.148
Well, they're back now.

39:14.337 --> 39:18.074
Okay, we're here. Show us.

39:18.141 --> 39:20.709
Do it. You promised.

39:37.493 --> 39:39.495
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

39:39.562 --> 39:42.098
Hoo-hoo! Merry Christmas, Zoe!

39:42.165 --> 39:44.434
Merry Christmas, Franklin!

39:49.405 --> 39:50.673
Time to drink and drive!

39:50.739 --> 39:52.774
Oh, whoops!

39:52.841 --> 39:54.277
'Whoo-hoo-hoo!'

39:54.344 --> 39:58.147
- Whoa!
- M. Merry. C. Christmas.

39:58.214 --> 40:00.550
M. Merry..

40:02.085 --> 40:06.089
Bah! Ha-ha-ha!
Pain is fun!

40:06.155 --> 40:08.591
You better be good,
or Santa won't come.

40:08.658 --> 40:11.361
But, Bee Sharp, now that
Zoe and Franklin are here

40:11.427 --> 40:12.729
he's sure to come!

40:12.794 --> 40:14.897
The dude loves kids!

40:14.964 --> 40:17.934
Kids and cookies!
That's his deal.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.937
Can he come and join us?
Really, is it true?

40:21.004 --> 40:22.305
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

40:22.372 --> 40:23.640
Then he won't forget us.

Frankie!

42:16.886 --> 42:19.055
What are you guys doing up here?

42:23.726 --> 42:25.328
What was the one thing
that you were told to..

42:40.643 --> 42:42.011
Kids, get back!

42:54.724 --> 42:56.860
- Give me your hand.
- My foot's stuck in here.

42:56.926 --> 42:58.327
Just make sure
the kids get back.

42:58.394 --> 43:00.062
Guys, back away.

43:00.129 --> 43:02.265
Towards the wall,
not the window.

43:05.201 --> 43:07.170
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:07.236 --> 43:10.006
No,
my foot's really wedged in here.

43:15.144 --> 43:17.613
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.883
Alright.

43:19.949 --> 43:21.250
- I got you.
- Okay.

43:21.317 --> 43:22.452
Come on.

43:32.562 --> 43:34.997
'What was the one
thing you were told not to do?'

43:35.064 --> 43:36.499
The one thing!

43:36.566 --> 43:39.035
You do not go up
to the third floor ever!

43:39.101 --> 43:40.136
Did you see
what happened to me?

43:40.203 --> 43:42.472
What if that was you?

43:42.538 --> 43:45.174
Children,
answer your mother, please.

43:49.045 --> 43:52.248
Hannah, what happened here?

43:54.283 --> 43:55.953
What are you talking about?

43:56.018 --> 43:57.888
You know what I'm talking about.

43:57.955 --> 43:59.989
No, I'm sorry, Alicia, I don't.

44:00.056 --> 44:02.291
Why did this place close down?

44:05.528 --> 44:06.996
I don't know anything
about this place

44:07.063 --> 44:09.365
except for its lack
of structural integrity.

44:09.432 --> 44:11.167
'And if a bunch of weird shit
happened here years ago'

44:11.234 --> 44:13.836
'it means nothing.'

44:13.904 --> 44:15.838
Here's some advice for you guys.

44:15.906 --> 44:18.808
Bad stuff happens all the time.

44:18.876 --> 44:20.176
And you know what you do?

44:20.243 --> 44:23.246
You put it behind you
and you move on.

44:25.348 --> 44:27.617
Yes, Mrs. Cashman.

44:27.683 --> 44:29.252
It's Hannah.

44:30.786 --> 44:32.522
Give me those toys. Now.

44:40.563 --> 44:44.433
Did you say anything about weird
shit happening here years ago?

44:48.638 --> 44:50.540
I just said it closed.

45:20.102 --> 45:22.672
- 'Daddy!'
- 'Hey, guys.'

45:24.240 --> 45:25.308
Is that our tree?

45:25.374 --> 45:27.476
It sure is. Do you like it?

45:27.543 --> 45:29.211
- So cool!
- Awesome!

45:29.278 --> 45:30.846
Well, let's set it up.

45:30.914 --> 45:32.148
Zoe, Franklin, did you tell

45:32.214 --> 45:34.350
your father what happened?

45:34.417 --> 45:35.751
No.

45:35.818 --> 45:38.120
They went up to the third floor.

45:38.187 --> 45:39.789
What? Wait.

45:39.856 --> 45:43.659
We told you guys under
no circumstances whatsoever.

45:43.726 --> 45:46.495
- Are we in trouble?
- The floor gave way.

45:46.562 --> 45:49.231
The third floor
is literally falling apart.

45:49.298 --> 45:52.069
Okay. Okay, um,
we'll barricade the stairs.

45:52.134 --> 45:53.669
- I'll get the wood.
- No.

45:53.736 --> 45:57.239
Emmett, go home, okay?
B-be with your family.

45:57.306 --> 45:58.841
Well, that's another thing.
Come here.

45:58.909 --> 46:00.710
Let me show you somethin'.

46:07.483 --> 46:10.020
Nobody's gettin' off
this mountain today.

46:10.087 --> 46:12.588
Emmett.

46:12.655 --> 46:14.523
- It's-it's Christmas.
- It's alright.

46:14.590 --> 46:16.759
I told them I might get stuck
in the weather.

46:16.826 --> 46:19.495
The roads will be clear
in the morning. I'll get home.

46:19.562 --> 46:21.364
Hey, well,
you're gonna be here with us.

46:21.430 --> 46:24.266
And we're gonna have
a wonderful family Christmas.

46:24.333 --> 46:25.735
Right, dear?

46:26.970 --> 46:29.805
Exactly. Now, uh..

46:29.873 --> 46:32.541
Who wants to help mommy
decorate the tree?

46:35.344 --> 46:37.914
- Where are the kids?
- 'Here we are!'

46:37.981 --> 46:41.018
This is Santa's Elf,
he's gonna help us decorate.

found these decorations again?

47:06.509 --> 47:09.445
In the garage. There was
a whole box of them down there.

47:09.512 --> 47:11.614
Hm. That's funny.

47:12.581 --> 47:14.316
- Why?
- No, I m..

47:14.383 --> 47:15.618
I mean, I just been everywhere

47:15.685 --> 47:18.155

Oh, they were probably
just scared, honey. That's all.

Why?

49:23.679 --> 49:27.650
Oh, uh, Santa's gonna need
their help to put out the gifts.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.903
Sorry, buddy, it's almost
through. Almost through.

56:26.970 --> 56:28.605
- Ah!
- Oh!

56:28.671 --> 56:31.574
'Oh, shit!'

56:31.641 --> 56:33.676
- Emmett! Oh!
- Emmett!

56:33.742 --> 56:34.711
Uh, oh, God!

56:43.819 --> 56:46.723
Okay, can you hear me? Emmett!

56:46.788 --> 56:48.391
Just blink if you can hear me.

56:49.859 --> 56:51.661
Okay, watch your head. Hm.

56:58.935 --> 57:01.204
Okay, good.

57:01.271 --> 57:03.306
Alright.
Okay, babe, wish me luck.

57:03.373 --> 57:04.974
But, David, the road,
they're-they're bad.

57:05.041 --> 57:06.409
What if you don't make it back?

57:06.476 --> 57:08.044
There is no what if I don't.

57:08.111 --> 57:11.214
Remember? Look, I'll be fine.

57:11.281 --> 57:12.781
I'm just gonna get him
to the hospital

57:12.848 --> 57:14.150
then turn around
and come right back.

57:14.217 --> 57:16.152
- I promise.
- Okay.

57:16.219 --> 57:17.220
Okay.

57:18.855 --> 57:20.156
Promise.

57:42.412 --> 57:43.680
Alright, hang on, buddy.

57:43.746 --> 57:46.949
Yeah, you got one job.
Just-just keep breathing.

57:47.016 --> 57:49.018
Can you do that for me?

57:55.458 --> 57:57.393
What the hell?

58:20.683 --> 58:22.785
Okay. Yes. Signal.

58:35.898 --> 58:37.567
Come on!

58:42.405 --> 58:44.040
Come on!

58:45.375 --> 58:47.243
Shit!

58:47.310 --> 58:48.911
Ugh!

58:57.553 --> 59:00.556
Alright, it won't be long now.
Okay?

59:31.587 --> 59:35.158
Alright. That's right, buddy.
Yup. Just keep breathing.

59:38.561 --> 59:40.029
Just keep breathing.

59:46.135 --> 59:49.205
You okay, buddy? Emmett?

59:50.773 --> 59:52.108
Emmett?

59:56.012 --> 59:58.014
Oh, shit!

59:59.015 --> 1:00:00.383
What the f..

1:01:08.384 --> 1:01:09.519
Hi.

1:01:10.853 --> 1:01:12.822
Have you heard anything?

1:01:12.890 --> 1:01:15.258
Not yet, but, um..

1:01:16.125 --> 1:01:18.094
I wanted to apologize.

1:01:19.028 --> 1:01:20.763
You don't owe me any apology.

1:01:20.830 --> 1:01:23.332
No, I do.

1:01:23.399 --> 1:01:26.736
What I said to you earlier,
about bad things happening

1:01:26.802 --> 1:01:30.007
and you just... don't think
about it and-and move on

1:01:30.072 --> 1:01:33.075
it was insensitive.

1:01:33.142 --> 1:01:35.144
It's fine.

1:01:35.211 --> 1:01:37.046
No, it's not fine.

1:01:38.714 --> 1:01:39.682
It's how I live my life

1:01:39.749 --> 1:01:43.085
and look where it's gotten us.

1:01:46.188 --> 1:01:48.324
This isn't your fault.

1:01:50.192 --> 1:01:53.296
Years ago

1:01:53.362 --> 1:01:55.798
when this place
was still a hospital..

1:01:55.866 --> 1:01:58.734
...someone died.

1:01:58.801 --> 1:02:02.605
A little boy, from this illness.

1:02:02.672 --> 1:02:07.209
They tried to save him, but
his mother couldn't accept it.

1:02:07.276 --> 1:02:11.480
She went mad with grief.

1:02:11.547 --> 1:02:13.816
<i>What did she do?</i>

1:02:13.884 --> 1:02:18.120
<i>They said she
was already different.</i>

1:02:18.187 --> 1:02:19.990
<i>Believed strange things.</i>

1:02:20.057 --> 1:02:23.459
<i>No one knows
exactly how or what she did</i>

1:02:23.526 --> 1:02:27.396
<i>but... one Christmas morning..</i>

1:02:28.731 --> 1:02:29.900
<i>...they found
all of the children</i>

1:02:29.967 --> 1:02:31.200
<i>had been killed.</i>

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.409
Look, no one who knew
what happened here

1:02:40.476 --> 1:02:42.845
would ever come near this place.

1:02:45.615 --> 1:02:47.183
Except for me.

1:02:49.585 --> 1:02:52.588
I just thought,
"Don't think about it. Move on."

1:02:55.224 --> 1:02:57.660
Now Emmett is..

1:03:01.764 --> 1:03:02.732
No.

1:03:03.833 --> 1:03:05.167
Hannah.

1:03:06.469 --> 1:03:08.604
You can't take that on.

1:03:10.139 --> 1:03:11.474
You can't.

1:03:57.154 --> 1:03:59.255
It's Christmas morning!

1:03:59.321 --> 1:04:01.824
What is it?

1:04:01.892 --> 1:04:04.193
It's still dark out.

1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:06.796
- Did Santa come?
- Sweet victory!

1:04:06.863 --> 1:04:09.832
Okay! Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Get up!

1:04:09.900 --> 1:04:11.600
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go, let's go!

1:04:11.667 --> 1:04:13.569
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

1:04:13.636 --> 1:04:16.572
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!

1:04:16.639 --> 1:04:19.842
Santa's got a brand-new bag,
and he dumped it right here!

1:04:19.910 --> 1:04:24.915
Now that there are children,
Christmas is saved!

1:04:24.981 --> 1:04:27.150
"Alicia!" Nah, she's not here.

1:04:27.216 --> 1:04:30.153
Sorry, Alicia.
You snooze, you lose.

1:04:30.219 --> 1:04:31.888
Nice knowing ya.

1:04:34.623 --> 1:04:35.892
Oops!

1:04:37.326 --> 1:04:39.963
Watch this. Ha-ha..

1:04:40.030 --> 1:04:41.831
Oop, oop, oop, whoa, whoa.

1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:45.668
Destroy! Destroy!

1:04:45.735 --> 1:04:48.571
Here you go!

1:04:48.637 --> 1:04:51.108
'Poor kid. Open it, open it!'

1:04:51.174 --> 1:04:53.576
'Oh, clothes!'

1:04:53.642 --> 1:04:55.578
N. No!

1:04:57.847 --> 1:04:59.448
'Burn, burn, burn!'

1:04:59.515 --> 1:05:01.250
To dad.

1:05:01.317 --> 1:05:03.853
Hey, Rusty, deliver this,
will ya?

1:05:08.557 --> 1:05:11.128
'No signature required. Ha-ha.'

1:05:11.194 --> 1:05:12.762
'Burn it! Burn it!'

1:05:18.201 --> 1:05:20.237
Any word yet?

1:05:20.302 --> 1:05:23.706
No. Not yet,
but I trust your father.

1:05:27.177 --> 1:05:29.478
How are those idiots up?

1:05:31.347 --> 1:05:32.381
It's Christmas Eve.

1:05:36.552 --> 1:05:39.923
Listen to them. They're happy.

1:05:41.457 --> 1:05:43.559
We're up here
hoping Emmett isn't dead

1:05:43.626 --> 1:05:45.828
and they're downstairs laughing.

1:05:47.296 --> 1:05:49.632
Alright, I'll go down.

1:05:54.403 --> 1:05:56.006
Merry Christmas.

1:06:02.946 --> 1:06:05.581
- "To mommy."
- I don't see her around.

1:06:05.648 --> 1:06:07.951
- Do you?
- Can I?

1:06:08.018 --> 1:06:09.752
I insist.

1:06:13.455 --> 1:06:15.324
'Ha-ha! Yeah, that's it.'

1:06:20.596 --> 1:06:22.631
'Destroy. Destroy!'

1:06:22.698 --> 1:06:25.936
That's right.
Smash the shit out of it!

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.742
What the hell's happening?

1:06:36.478 --> 1:06:39.249
No. No, no.

1:06:39.316 --> 1:06:41.617
This isn't normal.

1:06:41.684 --> 1:06:42.919
Why?

1:06:45.188 --> 1:06:48.291
I wanna know!
Why did you do this?

1:06:48.357 --> 1:06:50.994
We didn't do it, they did.

1:06:51.061 --> 1:06:55.932
- The toys did it.
- They said it was okay.

1:06:55.999 --> 1:06:57.200
Take that off!

1:07:08.311 --> 1:07:09.880
Go upstairs.

1:07:09.946 --> 1:07:12.315
Go upstairs to your room
and wait for me.

1:07:12.381 --> 1:07:14.284
- But our toys...
- No! Now!

1:07:14.351 --> 1:07:15.684
Go!

1:07:42.411 --> 1:07:45.048
Okay, Uncle Monkey

1:07:45.115 --> 1:07:47.449
time to warm you up.

1:08:03.967 --> 1:08:05.335
Rose!

1:08:05.402 --> 1:08:07.569
Rose.. Help me put this out.

1:08:07.636 --> 1:08:09.005
What happened?

1:08:24.787 --> 1:08:27.190
Who wants to meet
the other children?

1:08:27.257 --> 1:08:30.726
- What other children?
- Come on. I'll show ya.

1:08:43.472 --> 1:08:44.441
We got it.

1:08:50.213 --> 1:08:52.282
I'm sorry?

1:08:52.349 --> 1:08:54.217
I didn't say anything.

1:08:54.284 --> 1:08:55.352
I just heard you say...

1:09:47.803 --> 1:09:50.273
- Let's move!
- Forward!

1:11:05.915 --> 1:11:07.783
Fuck Christmas.

1:11:11.488 --> 1:11:13.156
Where are the children?

1:11:15.091 --> 1:11:16.292
Oh, no.

1:12:42.478 --> 1:12:43.880
No, no, no!

1:12:46.249 --> 1:12:47.317
No!

1:12:54.891 --> 1:12:58.595
W. Window. J. Jump.

1:13:07.769 --> 1:13:10.173
- Somebody help me. Help me.
- Okay.

1:13:55.652 --> 1:13:58.121
Help us.

1:14:00.256 --> 1:14:01.524
Wait here.

1:14:03.660 --> 1:14:06.029
- Come on, kids. Jump!
- No, no, no. Don't jump.

1:14:06.095 --> 1:14:07.530
- Don't jump.
- 'Come on, do it.'

1:14:07.597 --> 1:14:09.899
I'm coming towards you, okay?
I'm coming for you.

1:14:09.966 --> 1:14:11.868
- 'Keep going, keep going.'
- No, no.

1:14:11.934 --> 1:14:13.536
Stop. Okay, I'm not moving,
I'm not moving.

1:14:13.603 --> 1:14:15.772
'Ignore the woman behind you.'

1:14:15.837 --> 1:14:17.874
Mommy's not moving, okay?

1:14:44.567 --> 1:14:48.204
Can you just.. Can you look
at mommy for just a second?

1:14:48.271 --> 1:14:50.506
For just a second.
Please, I just..

1:14:50.573 --> 1:14:52.742
I wanna ask you a question,
that's all.

1:14:52.809 --> 1:14:54.377
'I just wanna ask you
a question.'

1:15:44.060 --> 1:15:45.361
Guys, I just wanna know.

1:15:45.428 --> 1:15:48.531
You have so many
nice toys up here

1:15:48.598 --> 1:15:50.800
do you wanna see what Santa
brought for you this year?

1:15:50.868 --> 1:15:52.301
J. Jump.

1:15:52.368 --> 1:15:55.873
- Let's all jump together.
- No. No, please.

1:16:10.153 --> 1:16:12.455
- I'm coming to you, okay?
- Come on, jump!

1:16:12.522 --> 1:16:15.458
Don't listen to them. Maybe we
can all play with them together.

1:16:15.525 --> 1:16:19.662
They don't want that. They wanna
be with their new friends.

1:16:28.604 --> 1:16:29.907
Jump! Now!

1:16:29.972 --> 1:16:31.474
- No! Do not jump.
- 'Do it.'

1:16:31.541 --> 1:16:34.477
Please. Turn around.
Turn around and look at me.

1:16:34.544 --> 1:16:36.646
- 'Forward! Forward.'
- Look at me!

1:16:36.712 --> 1:16:39.048
- 'Shut up, you dusty windbag.'
- 'Oh, no..'

1:16:39.115 --> 1:16:40.850
- 'Do it. Do it!'
- No!

1:16:40.918 --> 1:16:42.452
'Don't listen to them.
Listen to me!'

1:16:42.518 --> 1:16:46.857
- 'Keep going.'
- Jump. Jump, jump, jump!

1:16:46.924 --> 1:16:48.324
No! No!

1:16:50.593 --> 1:16:54.263
Okay. Okay. You okay?
I got you, I got you.

1:16:54.964 --> 1:16:57.133
'I got you. Okay.'

1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:59.769
Good job. Good job.

1:16:59.836 --> 1:17:01.737
'Okay, yeah.'

1:17:04.674 --> 1:17:06.476
K. Kill.

1:17:13.549 --> 1:17:15.117
Mommy..

1:17:19.489 --> 1:17:22.425
Release Kid Crock!
Release Kid Crock!

1:17:22.492 --> 1:17:25.495
- Shut up.
- No, no, no.

1:17:25.561 --> 1:17:27.129
- 'No!'
- Rose!

1:17:27.196 --> 1:17:28.899
Try to get them down to me.

1:17:53.489 --> 1:17:55.191
'No, no, let me out!'

1:18:04.367 --> 1:18:06.769
Die, you insufferable snowflake!

1:18:06.836 --> 1:18:09.405
I'll slice you up
like birthday cake!

1:18:12.275 --> 1:18:14.143
'Oh! Is that all you got?'

1:18:14.210 --> 1:18:15.979
'Come on, give me some more!'

1:18:27.657 --> 1:18:30.961
'Release Kid Crock!
Release Kid Crock!'

1:18:31.028 --> 1:18:33.296
'That's an order, young lady.'

1:18:35.032 --> 1:18:36.365
Mommy.

1:18:39.903 --> 1:18:41.103
My babies. Oh.

1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:52.015
Did Santa come?

1:18:52.081 --> 1:18:55.418
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Santa came.

1:18:55.484 --> 1:18:58.454
Are you okay?

1:18:59.655 --> 1:19:03.125
Yeah. I think so.

1:19:05.695 --> 1:19:07.196
Alicia?

1:19:07.998 --> 1:19:09.565
So far so good.

1:19:10.867 --> 1:19:12.501
I think that's all of them.

1:19:13.703 --> 1:19:15.671
- No.
- What?

1:19:15.738 --> 1:19:20.242
- Where's that, you know..
- That awful monkey.

1:19:43.666 --> 1:19:46.168
No! Rose!

1:21:08.151 --> 1:21:09.485
Dad.

1:21:10.653 --> 1:21:11.955
Alicia.

1:21:17.060 --> 1:21:18.028
Dad!

1:22:53.990 --> 1:22:55.058
Okay.

1:22:56.193 --> 1:22:58.327
