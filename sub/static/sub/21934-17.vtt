What would you say

00:08.342 --> 00:11.245
I'd tell you that I love you
and that medical science

00:11.279 --> 00:14.115
has ways around
issues like these.
Ditto.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.117

Speaking of Walter,
there is nothing between us.

too little heart.

What's this?
You seemed upset
by Paige's germs

00:29.163 --> 00:30.798
so I mixed up
a disinfectant solution.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.366
She laughed at my joke.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.335
She gave me disinfectant
for Valentine's.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.204
And the way
she described

00:36.237 --> 00:37.838
her perfect guy to Paige?

Yeah, if you can't

The Plastics Consortium

02:39.527 --> 02:41.295
I can't stop thinking

about the garbage island

02:44.465 --> 02:46.934
In 30 years, the ocean is
going to be more plastic

02:46.967 --> 02:48.202
than marine life.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.571
So I'm trying to
set up meetings

02:50.604 --> 02:52.706
with the CEOs of various
bottled water corporations,

02:52.740 --> 02:55.476
so they can explore a new
design for their bottles

02:55.509 --> 02:59.513
that uses .14 fewer
grams of plastic.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.914
But nobody is
calling me back.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.916
I don't trust bottled water.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.853
Had a real spring on my
grandfather's farm upstate

I am not gonna dumb
myself down for your friends.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.843
What credibility
would I have?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.012
I just wanted to have
a quiet cup of coffee.

03:32.045 --> 03:32.913
PAIGE:
And I just wanted

03:32.946 --> 03:34.848
a regular fun night
with non-geniusy stuff

03:34.882 --> 03:36.617
for a change,

03:36.650 --> 03:37.618
Ruined what?
He refused

03:37.651 --> 03:38.852

"pedestrian"

03:38.886 --> 03:40.521

with my friends.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.390
So when the clue
was "carbon copy,"

03:42.423 --> 03:45.626
he drew one atom of carbon
and another atom of carbon.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.696
Come on, Paige, what's
a better way to display that?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.631

Hey, hey, hey,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.036
I'm the first to admit
that my overall decisiveness

03:56.069 --> 03:57.805
has been affected by
the doctor decision,

03:57.838 --> 03:58.972
but it's not like
I can't come up with

03:59.006 --> 04:00.240
any course of action.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.677
Really? Okay, I will wear the
sexy pharmacist outfit tonight

04:18.792 --> 04:20.961
No medicine for you,

04:20.994 --> 04:22.596

genius IQ on the team.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.535
Geez. You're really mad at me.

Uh, guys.
What's this pictograph?

04:29.570 --> 04:30.938

04:30.971 --> 04:33.073
See? Even the guy
with the lowest IQ

04:33.106 --> 04:34.608

04:34.642 --> 04:35.543
That's a defamatory,

04:35.576 --> 04:36.910
unconfirmed rumor.
PAIGE: You know what?

04:36.944 --> 04:37.778
We don't have time
for this--

04:37.811 --> 04:39.212
we need to catch
our flight to Colorado.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.915
PANDS is waiting.
Hey, what the hell is
this case all about anyway?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.084
You guys are supposed
to explain it to me.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.853
It's been weeks,
and you've been ducking me.

04:45.886 --> 04:46.820
Oh, don't you get it, Cabe?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.356
These guys can't
bring themselves

04:48.389 --> 04:50.057
to dumb it down for us.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.825
Oh, right.
Cabe, here it is.

04:51.859 --> 04:52.993
PANDS is
the Particle Accelerator

04:53.026 --> 04:54.395
Neutrino Detection Station.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.096
It's a physics
laboratory

04:56.129 --> 04:57.698
in the Rocky Mountains.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
World's deepest lab.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.534
It's built three
kilometers underground

05:00.568 --> 05:02.503
to shield experiments

05:02.536 --> 05:03.437
from cosmic radiation.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.972
Has a state-of-the-art
particle collider.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.440
And the PANDS
scientists think

05:06.474 --> 05:07.908
they detected a WIMP.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.343
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.744
I'm sure they're all wimps.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.780
No, no, a Weakly Interacting
Massive Particle.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.848
It's theorized they constitute
dark matter and could interact

05:14.882 --> 05:17.385
with forces outside of
the standard model of physics.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.986
A WIMP would be
a momentous discovery.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.521
Problem is,
many of these discoveries

05:20.554 --> 05:21.755
are conveniently announced

05:21.789 --> 05:24.725
right when labs are applying
for federal funding.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.794
Some of them could be bogus.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.996
So the government hired us
to verify experiment results

05:29.029 --> 05:30.464
before they give the grant.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.732
Yes, and the lab's
been cleared out

05:31.765 --> 05:32.766
for us to conduct verification,

05:32.800 --> 05:37.104
which we should run through
before we get there.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.474
Now, this ball is filled
with one ton of liquid argon,

05:40.508 --> 05:42.643
stored at negative
190 degrees Celsius,

05:42.676 --> 05:46.146
and surrounded by hundreds
of photomultiplier tubes

05:46.179 --> 05:48.882
sensitive to the emissions
of even a single photon.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.884
So if there
is a WIMP,

05:50.918 --> 05:53.421
it will produce
a flash of VUV rays

05:53.454 --> 05:55.155
detectable by
these sensors.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.791
And we will run a systems test
on the whole detector.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.428
He's not even winded,
which pisses me off even more.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.763
WALTER:
Then we'll irradiate the ball
with neutrons

06:02.796 --> 06:06.500
from the supply of radioactive
californium I obtained.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.469
Oh. Think I found a WIMP.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.772
If the neutrons emitted
by spontaneous fission

06:11.805 --> 06:13.941
in the californium interact
with liquid argon,

06:13.974 --> 06:16.009
as we predict, the
detector is sound

06:16.043 --> 06:19.580
and the WIMP discovery
is verified.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.915
Glad you explained it to me.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.168
Uh, a quick... quick
lay of the land.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.804
The lab is built beneath
an existing gold mine.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.074

07:00.187 --> 07:02.590
Uh, it has monitors linked
to security cameras

07:02.623 --> 07:03.791
peppered throughout the lab,

07:03.824 --> 07:05.493
so we'll be able
to watch you work.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.627
Uh, as I'm sure

07:06.660 --> 07:08.128
you're aware,
there are consequences

07:08.161 --> 07:10.698
to being that far underground
for extended periods of time.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.233
The increased air pressure
pushes toxins into the blood,

07:13.266 --> 07:15.235
which could negatively impact
the neural pathways.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.238
Paige, you think about it
like, uh, it's just gunk

07:18.271 --> 07:19.707
blocking your brain.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.074
Not everything
has to be translated.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.643
The "neural pathways"
is easy enough.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.745
They're... the pathways...

07:24.778 --> 07:26.179
for...

07:26.213 --> 07:27.014
Almost there.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.616
...all things neural.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.250
There you go.
End result is that the lab

07:30.283 --> 07:32.152
has a safety limit
of four hours.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.221
After that,
it's harder to think,

07:34.254 --> 07:36.123
uh, cognitive
abilities decline.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.991
It's like a-a graph

07:38.025 --> 07:39.226

07:56.243 --> 07:58.278
(phone rings)
PAIGE: Oh.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.581
(over phone): Hey, honey.
You at the convention?

08:00.614 --> 08:03.216
Uh, heading in now.
I'm really excited.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.217
Be sure to behave for Florence.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.187
Will you put her on the phone
for a second?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.857
Hello.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.726
Hi. I just wanted to say thanks
for taking Ralph along today.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.127
It's my pleasure.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.997
I normally dislike children,
but he's an abnormal child.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.567
Thank you. I... I think.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.169
Uh... oh. Security requires us
to check our phones at the door,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.071
so we won't be reachable
for a few hours.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.774
But I promise the moment we
get out, we'll give you a call.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.542
Okay? Talk soon.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.879
Eh, she won't be happy

08:31.912 --> 08:34.314
about not being able
to be in touch with me.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.618
Well, I'm-I'm sure she trusts
I'll take good care of you.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.152
It's not you.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.689
Only person she trusts
watching me is Sylvester.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.957
She always says he's
the most responsible

08:43.991 --> 08:46.159
and trustworthy member
of the team.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.728
Really?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.064
He seems afraid
of his own shadow.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.301
Um, just very cautious.
Another great trait he has.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.304
Yep, can't go wrong
with reliable old Sylvester.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.314
Man, we're
going down deep.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.983
SYLVESTER:
Don't remind me!

09:10.017 --> 09:11.585
What is that?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.754
Do you seriously
not know what this is?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.856
No more plastic in
the workplace; I wrote a memo.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.324
Oh, right, right.
Now I remember that memo.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.627
I, uh, I stuffed it
in a plastic jug,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.995
and then I threw it
in the gutter.
Very funny.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.697
Unhand that bottle.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.071
Are you happy now?

09:31.104 --> 09:33.306
Can the children fight later?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.275
We have work to do.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.611
(beeps)

09:42.650 --> 09:45.018
Okay.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.655
Yeah, we're in the lab.
SYLVESTER:
The clean room

09:47.688 --> 09:49.089
is super cool.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.157
WALTER:
Four hours starts now.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.260
Okay. Have fun down there.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.395
So, uh, the clean
room is fitted

09:55.428 --> 09:57.330
with directed,
high-pressurized nozzles

09:57.364 --> 10:00.100
that blow out a proprietary
hydrogen-nitrogen mixture

10:00.133 --> 10:01.869
that'll purify you
and your clothing.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.737
It's a little, uh...
(chuckles)

10:03.771 --> 10:05.272
...it's a little abrasive.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.273
But, uh, necessary--

10:06.306 --> 10:08.008
so you don't bring
contaminants into the lab.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.010
And I'm turning on the system.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.279
(low beeping)

10:12.312 --> 10:13.847
HAPPY: Hold on.
These industrial blowers

10:13.881 --> 10:17.117
will knock the boogers
out of your nose.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.596
(whooshing stops)

10:29.629 --> 10:32.232
RAJA: Okay. You are
completely purified.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.937
We have to get that
for the garage.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.774
Are you kidding me?

10:40.808 --> 10:43.143
I'm drinking purified
purified water.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.411
That's living, Sly.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.050
I can't believe
we're actually here.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.285
WALTER:
Every piece of equipment
is state-of-the-art.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.255
"Prairie Dogs
Under Observation."

10:55.288 --> 10:56.957
Ugh. Prairie dogs?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.959
Disgusting dirt dwellers.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.894
TOBY:
That must be how the scientists
analyze the effects

11:00.928 --> 11:02.329
of pressure on cognition,

11:02.362 --> 11:05.098
'cause prairie dogs are
naturally burrowing creatures,

11:05.132 --> 11:06.900
so they might have ways
of reacting

11:06.934 --> 11:08.335
to increased pressure
that we don't know about.

11:08.368 --> 11:12.239
Like being unable to
make basic decisions.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.075
That's uncalled for.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.884
The argon tank.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.919
It's everything
I've ever dreamed.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.123
HAPPY:
I'll check the photosensors

11:30.157 --> 11:31.892
while you guys handle
the monitors.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.934
Man, think about what
they're doing down here.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.169
It's amazing.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.504
Four percent of the universe

11:44.537 --> 11:46.406
is matter as we understand it.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.409
26% is dark matter
and 70% is dark energy,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.278
both of which we know
bupkis about.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.981
That means that if we
learned everything

11:54.014 --> 11:56.116
in the current encyclopedia
of human knowledge,

11:56.149 --> 11:58.351
we'd still only comprehend
four percent of the universe.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.387
Which means you'd only know
about one percent.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.822
Lowest Scorpion IQ and all.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.423
That's unconfirmed.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.358
Okay, computers are up
and running.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.795
Keep an eye on the timer.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.496
We have three hours
and 48 minutes

12:09.529 --> 12:11.999
until our brains stop
working at full capacity.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.535
This is super cool.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.038
I bet Paige and Cabe are
on the edge of their seats.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.307
Okay.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.910
Celebrities names
who are also food.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.012
Sugar Ray Leonard.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.446
Kevin Bacon.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.447
Chuck Connors.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.916
How's that food?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.818
Ground chuck, it's meat.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.552
Who calls meat "chuck" anymore?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.487
I do. It's valid. Go.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.388
Ice Cube.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.456
Ice is frozen water.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.524
Invalid.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.392
He's right.
Not a food.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.462
Ugh. How long have we been
doing this?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.564
40 minutes.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.066
Feels like 40 hours.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.506
Just giving the diagnostic
results a perusal.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.909
Oh, we're wrapped already?
The four hours

12:55.943 --> 12:58.145
went by that quickly.
You want to see this.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.481
Look at the rise of
the photoelectron integral.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.950
WALTER:
Toby, check this out.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.953
Guys, you seeing this?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.921
(snoring)

13:07.955 --> 13:10.090
Uh, yeah.
Cabe can't see anything,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.125
He's literally passed out
from boredom.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.560
WALTER: Well, ignoring
the fact that you used

13:13.593 --> 13:15.362
"literally" incorrectly,
because he fell asleep

13:15.395 --> 13:16.830
rather than "passed out,"

13:16.864 --> 13:18.331
can you let Raja take a look
at this?

13:18.365 --> 13:19.466
RAJA: No, I see it,
I see it.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.301
The argon ball responded
accurately to the californium,

13:21.334 --> 13:23.436
which-which-which means
a valid detector.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.372
We... We found WIMPs.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.506
Our-our discovery
is verified.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
(whooping)

13:28.508 --> 13:30.310
Thank you. Thank you.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.345
Yes!
(groans)

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
What's goin' on?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.450
Just, uh, nerds getting rowdy.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.451
We're heading topside.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.620
Make it snappy. You're
over the four hour limit.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.622
You don't wanna get daffy
down there.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.157
Oh, come on. We haven't
even checked out

13:44.191 --> 13:45.492
the particle collider yet.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.327
When are we ever
gonna be back here?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.461
You know, the four-hour
limit applies

13:48.495 --> 13:49.897
to people with normal brains.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.464
We're geniuses, even Toby,

13:51.498 --> 13:54.167
so I'm sure that we can stay
down a little bit longer

13:54.201 --> 13:55.602
without any adverse effects.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.204
Let's do it.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.140
Oh, 9,000 feet underground,
suddenly Sly's a rebel.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.374
WALTER:
Okay, we won't stay for long!

14:01.408 --> 14:04.611
We'll be back up with your test
results soon, Raja, promise.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.513
Is this okay?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.148
Hmm? Yeah, I suppose
it's all right.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.549
It's just a, it's just
a few minutes.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.154
Oh.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.356
What a beauty.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.292
And it's only operating
at 50% capacity.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.529
Its particles accelerate to
15 tera electron volts.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.231
An electronic
feedback mechanism

14:24.264 --> 14:27.300
prevents it from reaching
its full capacity of 30,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.669
which could validate
a specific class

14:29.702 --> 14:31.671
of supersymmetry theories,

14:31.704 --> 14:32.605
better helping us understand

14:32.639 --> 14:36.476
the fabric of matter
and energy themselves.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.679
There's also
a small chance that...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.982
that particles colliding
with that much energy

14:42.015 --> 14:43.416
would create a black hole

14:43.450 --> 14:44.651
that'll swallow up
our whole solar system.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.186
How small a chance?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.055
No one knows.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.090
It's like a game of
proton roulette.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.492
Roulette's odds are 37 to one;
these are far greater.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.994
That was a terrible analogy.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.195
Toby, are you okay?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.429
TOBY:
Yep, yeah.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.132
It's all good in
the neighborhood, my man.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.667
Okay, maybe we should
get out now.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.003
PAIGE:
Good idea.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.640
I was reading a book on
antigravity the other day

15:07.674 --> 15:09.476
and I couldn't
put it down.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.644
That's my joke
from my stand-up.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.579
(laughs)
You're really funny.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.214
I have the gift.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.083
(clatter, hissing)
What the hell was that?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.218
WALTER:
It's the nozzle to one of
the hydrogen gas tanks.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.619
It popped off.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.787
It's leaking out
flammable hydrogen.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.056
If we don't find a fix quick,
this joint's gonna blow up.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.092
I'll shut it down with one of
the electrical backups.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.426
Well, how did this happen?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.461
Nozzles aren't
supposed to pop off.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.399
(screams)
(prairie dog squeaking)

15:32.432 --> 15:34.201
Guessing that's how.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.068
SYLVESTER:
A prairie dog.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.336
Told you they were
wretched animals.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.737
That must've escaped
from the cage,

15:37.770 --> 15:38.738
and messed with
the wiring.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.308
Th-That increased the
pressure in the tanks.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.210
WALTER:
The little guy did
extensive damage.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.378
Luckily, I'm here,
so I can stop it.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.314
You guys are four hours
30 minutes underground.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.416
You're gonna start losing IQ
points, if you're not already.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.583
You sure you're
up for this?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.152
Of course I am. In fact...

15:52.185 --> 15:53.753
Aha, I already did it.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.089
That seems a little bit
too fast, son.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.557
(hydrogen hissing)
Uh, Walt,

15:57.590 --> 15:59.592
you didn't fix crap;
the hydrogen's still leaking.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.128
Huh?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.196
(alarm beeping)
Oh, boy.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.766
The green indicator light from
the particle collider room.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.301
PAIGE:
Indicating what?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.769
Indicating that the collider's
been activated

16:09.802 --> 16:10.770
to reach full capacity.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.307
Walter, whatever you did
to the electronic system

16:14.341 --> 16:16.243
didn't shut down
the hydrogen.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.745
It stepped on
the collider's gas pedal.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.048
Does that mean it's gonna create
a black hole?

16:21.081 --> 16:25.218
Maybe. Or maybe it'll just
explode and kill us.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.087
Well, I don't make mistakes.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.588
My mental state
must be impaired.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.190
How do you walk around
like this?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.324
You're insulting me?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.293
Walt, you just started
a chain reaction

16:33.326 --> 16:35.128
that could destroy
the space-time continuum,

16:35.162 --> 16:36.729
and then Keanu Reeves
and the other guy

16:36.763 --> 16:38.265
are gonna pop out of
that phone booth.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.599
Who?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.334
Our only way out is through
a room filled

16:41.368 --> 16:44.204
with hydrogen gas and
flammable disinfectants.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.673
Tiniest friction created
by opening the door

16:46.706 --> 16:49.176
could cause a huge
gas explosion.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.577
(Toby laughs)

16:50.610 --> 16:54.181
(laughing):
I'm sorry.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.250
She said "huge gas explosion."

16:57.284 --> 17:00.153
(all laughing)

17:02.189 --> 17:03.456
Why are geniuses laughing

17:03.490 --> 17:04.824
at a fart joke
when they're about to die?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.261
'Cause they're not
geniuses anymore...

17:08.295 --> 17:10.297
they're idiots.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.233
♪

17:21.841 --> 17:23.176
RAJA: We've never left anyone
underground long enough

17:23.210 --> 17:24.411
to witness effects like this.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.112
They're not fully "idiots"
like you say,

17:25.145 --> 17:26.779
but they are rapidly approaching

17:26.813 --> 17:28.315
average intelligence.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.482
And every minute, it's gonna get
harder and harder

17:29.516 --> 17:30.483
for them to fix their situation.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.252
Guys, snap out of it.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.753
Walter, can't you undo
what you did with the wires

17:33.786 --> 17:35.555
to stop the collider?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.257
Okay, my intellect's been
compromised, but I have further

17:37.290 --> 17:39.192
to fall since I'm coming all
the way down from 197.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.393
So I can give it a crack.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.329
No. He can't risk
messing with those wires

17:42.362 --> 17:43.696
in case he makes
things more bad.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.365
You mean "worse"?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.267
Walt, do you have
a plan or not?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.701
Yes. Two, actually.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.470
While we still
retain some of our faculties,

17:50.503 --> 17:52.405
Sly and I will work to hack

17:52.439 --> 17:54.341
into the particle
collider to shut down

17:54.374 --> 17:57.244
the superconducting magnets, so
then stopping the acceleration

17:57.277 --> 17:58.811
from the protons
into the plasma.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.114
Um, sounds good.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.815
Okay, what's plan number two?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.384
Number two. (chuckles)

18:04.417 --> 18:06.419
(chuckles)

18:06.453 --> 18:08.188
WALTER:
Okay, seriously now.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.290
There is a button
at the other end

18:10.323 --> 18:11.858
of the clean room

18:11.891 --> 18:14.494
uh, that opens the door
to the mine shaft.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.363
Now, uh, we can use that
to vent out

18:16.396 --> 18:19.432
the flammable hydrogen that way,

18:19.466 --> 18:22.802
but we need a way
to push the button.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.138
Oh. The purification jets.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.874
Oh, if they can blow the
boogers out of your nose,

18:27.907 --> 18:29.176
they can depress the button.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.211
RAJA:
Okay, but the joystick controls
will be hard to move.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.312
There's no servo motor.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.514
It'll be like driving a car
without power steering.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.150
Okay, Cabe and Paige, you'll
need to rip the roof off

18:37.184 --> 18:39.552
the elevator shack
so the hydrogen can travel up,

18:39.586 --> 18:42.189
and escape safely
into the atmosphere. Let's go.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.458
Can we knock off
the roof supports?

18:45.492 --> 18:47.927
That'll collapse the roof
on the shaft, and it's too heavy

18:47.960 --> 18:49.896
to lift by hand.
Well, let's not do it
by hand at all.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.766
Let's secure the roof to the SUV
and rip it right out.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.302
Yeah, here. These work?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.536
Yes. We can use
mine cables.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.405
Let's go. Let's go!

18:58.438 --> 19:00.173
TOBY:
Okay, you see the button?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.474
Uh, you redirect
those two airstreams,

19:01.508 --> 19:02.642
I'll redirect these two.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.345
Sounds good.
Gloves on.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.314
And go.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.786
Huh. These controls
aren't hard to move.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.355
Raja's a weakling.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.490
Actually, the
pressure down here

19:17.524 --> 19:20.260
is pushing toxins
into our hebogoblin.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.328
Uh, it's "hemogiblin."

19:21.361 --> 19:23.530
It's also pushing oxygen

19:23.563 --> 19:25.298
into our muscles,
making them more powerful,

19:25.332 --> 19:27.634
so we're stupid,
but we're strong.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.437
Oh, man, we're
becoming dumb jocks.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.571
Thanks for the root beer.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.340
Conference has been
great so far.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.974
Wait for the inert
gas demonstration

19:35.007 --> 19:36.376
after intermission.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.810
I hear it's a game-changer.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.212
Cool.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.347
Always up for
a new experience.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.714
Sylvester taught me that.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.451
He said "gaining knowledge
is the embedded stone

19:44.484 --> 19:45.852
in the pathway
to enlightenment."

19:45.885 --> 19:47.487
He did?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.557
Didn't peg him as a philosopher.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.759
Philosopher, calculator,
he can do it all.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.561
I'm not that well-rounded.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.863
Chemistry is my one and only
wheelhouse.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.531
Mmm, right, but based on what

19:58.565 --> 20:00.667
you gravitated to in the
conference, your main interest

20:00.700 --> 20:03.570
is in particle flocculation
and coagulation.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.639
Wow. Yes, that's correct.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.376
How are you so familiar with
that area of research?

20:09.409 --> 20:10.443
From Scorpion.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.545
They're the smartest team
of people in the world.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.448
(both grunt)

20:15.482 --> 20:16.783
Can you let me...
Please.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.950
If I...
Let me in, please.
Thank you.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.619
Oh, it's a scorcher in here.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.887
It's only gonna get worse.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.456
Not if we can stop
the electromagnet

20:23.490 --> 20:24.824
from powering up and giving
the thingies enough energy.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.627
SYLVESTER: Thingies?
I think my intelligence quadrant

20:27.660 --> 20:29.662
is dropping faster
than anticipated.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.964
Intelligence quotient.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.534
Step aside.
I'll handle this.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.338
(computer beeps)

20:39.506 --> 20:40.740
We're shut out.

20:40.773 --> 20:41.941
What?

20:41.974 --> 20:43.576
I couldn't figure out
how to hack in,

20:43.610 --> 20:44.944
but the collider thinks
we're tampering with it,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.579
so it shut us out permanently.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.415
There's no way to stop
the magnets

20:48.448 --> 20:49.282
from heating up the plasma.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.850
Stop thinking you can do
genius stuff.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.452
You're like me and Cabe now.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.554
This thing's gonna blow.
It already blows.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.855
Our whole trip to the
accelerator's ruined.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.624
No. I mean it's gonna explode!

20:57.657 --> 20:58.558
Oh.
PAIGE:
No, it isn't.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.892
We're gonna get you
all to the surface,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.060
put some genius back
in your brains,

21:01.093 --> 21:02.562
and you're gonna
figure out a solution!

21:06.399 --> 21:09.035
Let's get Dumb and Dumber down
there back to Smart and Smarter!

21:12.539 --> 21:13.506
Gun it!

21:13.540 --> 21:15.608
(engine revving)

21:20.480 --> 21:22.849
All right, my airstreams are
pointing right at the button.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.585
Me, too.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.019
How come it's not depressing?

21:27.053 --> 21:29.055
It's incredibly depressing.
We're about to die.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.890
I meant the button.
CABE:
Because

21:30.923 --> 21:32.592
the damn broken hydrogen line

21:32.625 --> 21:35.094
has reduced the damn pressure
coming out of the damn nozzle.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.497
Man, it's annoying
being smarter than them.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.698
He's right.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.667
The blower alone
won't do it.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.535
Oh, I'm feeling a lot
of anxiety right now.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.571
I don't like being stupid
like Cabe and Paige.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.106
Thanks a lot.
I don't like not knowing
how to solve things.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.875
I can't imagine
living a life like this.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.910
It's like they don't even
know we're listening.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.812
Truth be told, I kind of dig it.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.682
I don't have a lot of thoughts
racing through my head,

21:55.715 --> 21:56.816
my worries are fading.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.685
I just got
to figure out one thing--

21:58.718 --> 22:01.754
how to press a stupid button.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.022
The water bottle.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.793
If we toss this up
into the air current,

22:06.826 --> 22:09.962
the force of the blower will
slam it into the button.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.566
You sure?
Well, you got a problem with me
being decisive now? Just do it.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.368
Such a simple solution,
you probably

22:15.402 --> 22:17.804
wouldn't have come up with it
if you could think non-simply.

22:17.837 --> 22:22.442
That's it. A simple solution
involving a water bottle.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.612
I just found out how I'm going
to solve my plastics problem.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.714
Okay, shut up and let me focus!

22:27.747 --> 22:29.982
(whooshing)

22:31.718 --> 22:34.421
Whoa! It worked.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.989
Ah, give me some!
(grunting)

22:37.023 --> 22:38.758
Okay. Sunlight's
hitting the mine shaft.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.693
Yeah, there's clear
access to the outside.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.595
That hydrogen's gonna
fill up that shaft soon.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.764
What is... that?

22:44.797 --> 22:47.066
PAIGE:
Ugh. Guys,

22:47.099 --> 22:48.635
it looks like the
water bottle's

22:48.668 --> 22:50.703
lighting the elevator
certificate on fire.

22:50.737 --> 22:51.938
So? They can get a new one.

22:51.971 --> 22:56.375
Mine shaft is full of flammable
hydrogen, you dumb son of a...

23:01.180 --> 23:02.915
Awesome!

23:02.949 --> 23:04.917
No-look high-five.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.919
(thud)
I said no-look high-five.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.489
Oh. Husband?

23:09.522 --> 23:12.124
Um, he's not moving.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.661
I feel like I normally
say something here.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.662
Not good.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.796
Yup, that's it.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.198
Uh, he's unconscious!

23:19.231 --> 23:21.801
Uh... pressure.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.136
It's a... pressure thing.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.605
Toby said it earlier.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.674
Toxins in the blood affect
neural pathways.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.508
Huh?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.643
He has gunk
in his brain!
Guys?

23:30.677 --> 23:32.579
Guys, listen to me.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.846
You have maybe ten minutes

23:33.880 --> 23:35.882
to get Dr. Curtis out
of there before there is

23:35.915 --> 23:38.785
a nitrogen overload in
his bloodstream, and he dies.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.192
WALTER: Okay,
you heard Roger.
Raja.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.694
Yes. You heard him.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.595
We need to get Toby
out of here right now.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.896
A fireball just
asploded the elevator!

23:49.929 --> 23:51.030
I know another way
out of the lab.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.999
There is a mine shaft
30 feet above the lab entrance.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.101
If I can get my liaison
at the mine to open it up,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.036
we can lower a rope to your team
and help 'em escape.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.705
(alarm beeping faster)

23:58.738 --> 24:01.207
(alarm blaring)
Uh-oh.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.975
What does yellow mean?

24:03.009 --> 24:04.611
Slow down?

24:04.644 --> 24:07.514
Uh, the plasma went
into the spirally, uh, things.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.749
RAJA: You mean
the supercharging coils.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.652
Bullets are in the gun, and
the hammer's being pulled back.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.487
Um...

24:14.521 --> 24:16.823
you have eight minutes before
the plasma enters the collider,

24:16.856 --> 24:19.559
the particles hit,
and we might, theoretically,

24:19.592 --> 24:22.161
experience the destruction
of our solar system.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.163
I don't care
about theories!

24:24.196 --> 24:27.600
I care about the reality of an
asplosion that kills all of us!

24:27.634 --> 24:29.268
It's all the more reason
to get our guys out of there.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.171
And you go get
that mine liaison. Now!

24:32.204 --> 24:33.940
Yup.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.243
We really need to deal
with the collider, right?

24:37.276 --> 24:40.647
We can't! Look at us! We're
getting dumber by the minute!

24:40.680 --> 24:43.249
Okay, as the more
smarter person here,

24:43.282 --> 24:47.019
we need to figure out a way
to get me to the surface

24:47.053 --> 24:48.888
so that I will be
at normal pressure,

24:48.921 --> 24:51.624
I can be a genius again,
and I will solve this.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.060
Great idea.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.562
HAPPY:
But...

24:55.595 --> 24:58.197
Won't he die if we don't
deal with him first?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.566
Crap!

24:59.599 --> 25:01.233
Besides, we can't get
to the surface

25:01.267 --> 25:02.702
until Roger comes
with his friend.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.704
Raja.
Right.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.172
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
He doesn't need a surface.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.039
He needs a vacuum.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.875
Much as I hate to say it,

25:08.908 --> 25:10.643
can you spell that out?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.011
Pressure caused Toby
to pass out.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.613
The least pressure possible
is a vacuum.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.582
I vacuum-seal leftovers for
me and Ralph all the time.

25:15.615 --> 25:19.819
You need to vacuum-seal
Doc's head to get rid of the

25:19.852 --> 25:21.721
pressure that's pushing
the toxins into his brain.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.756
That is a smart idea, Paige.

25:23.790 --> 25:27.059
Thank you... Walter.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.162
Stop wasting time
and shrink-wrap that shrink now!

25:30.196 --> 25:32.231
Walt, Walt, I know
you're foggy, but this is

25:32.264 --> 25:33.766
a rudimentary project.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.835
You don't need to be a genius
to pull it off.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.004
You just need to focus
on the basic tenants of science,

25:38.037 --> 25:39.171
and you'll figure it out.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.073
Okay, but I could...

25:41.107 --> 25:43.242
I could really do with you
holding my hand through it.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.244
I could use a teammate?

25:45.277 --> 25:48.014
Wow. You've never asked me to...

25:48.047 --> 25:50.817
to work on something technical
before.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.586
But why? You're so smart.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.590
Okay. Well, my-my food sealer
has a-a vacuum pump.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.058
You need to find

25:59.091 --> 26:00.827
something like
that in there.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.162
Okay, the, uh, argon room

26:03.195 --> 26:05.364
has a vacuum pump
to purify the ball.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.166
It's a mobile device
we can use for suction.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.268
PAIGE: My leftovers get sucked
up tight in plastic wrap.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.103
Is there anything in there
like that?

26:11.137 --> 26:13.572
Uh, yeah, the, uh,
cellophane in this equipment.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.244
Here. Keep it over here. Sly?

26:19.812 --> 26:21.347
All right.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.883
Okay, vacuum's in position.
Start wrapping.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.685
Um...

26:25.718 --> 26:28.120
(beatboxing)

26:28.154 --> 26:31.023
♪ My name's Sylvester,
saving Toby's my goal ♪

26:31.057 --> 26:33.760
♪ We better do it fast,
there might be a black hole. ♪

26:33.793 --> 26:35.762
(beatboxing)

26:35.795 --> 26:38.030
He meant wrapping cellophane,
moron.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.932
PAIGE:
We'll time this together.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.401
As soon as Toby
is fully wrapped,

26:42.434 --> 26:44.070
I'll hold my breath, too.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.639
When I gasp for air,
you uncover him.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.207
Great.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.744
You know, Paige,
I know I'm impaired,

26:51.778 --> 26:53.746
but I'm still lucid enough
to know

26:53.780 --> 26:57.016
that you're simplifying things
for me so that I can follow.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.986
And I thought that was a way
to dumb oneself down.

27:00.019 --> 27:04.190
But, actually, it's a way to be
more effective in communication.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.658
Thank you.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.759
You're welcome, Walter.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.227
You know,

27:08.260 --> 27:10.897
it feels really good to express
one's self openly like this.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.366
I feel like,
now that my IQ's out of the way,

27:14.400 --> 27:15.768
my EQ can flourish.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.870
If this is what
it's like to be you,

27:17.904 --> 27:20.306
I'm a tad envious.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.675
Who the hell is this guy?

27:22.709 --> 27:25.444
Maybe dopey Walter isn't so bad.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.714
Hurry! We only have 4.5 minutes
until the plasma is launched,

27:27.747 --> 27:29.348
and the world collapses
in on itself.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.417
Maybe.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.885
WALTER:
Happy, you ready?

27:32.919 --> 27:34.020
Flip the switch!

27:34.053 --> 27:36.756
(whooshing)

27:36.789 --> 27:38.157
CABE:
All right.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.158
Paige is holding her breath.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.693
(whooshing)

27:40.727 --> 27:42.161
Oh, this looks
like a horror movie.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.396
Looks like a side
of Grade A Chuck.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.700
See? Other people say "chuck".

27:47.734 --> 27:50.469
You know, Chuck's
a strange nickname.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.804
It's not really
born of Charles.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.173
It's not like "Will"

27:54.206 --> 27:56.375
for "William"
or "Mike" for "Michael."

27:56.408 --> 27:59.411
I mean, how is "Jack"
a nickname for "John"?

27:59.445 --> 28:01.714
Not even shorter.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.783
Or "Peg" is "Margaret."
What the hell is that?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.484
Good Lord, they're stupid.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.954
(whooshing)

28:07.987 --> 28:10.156
(exhales)
All right.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.190
Time's up! Unwrap him!

28:11.223 --> 28:14.160
(gasping)
Toby?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.194
How do you feel?

28:15.227 --> 28:16.929
Like Freud and Jung
had an all-out fisticuffs

28:16.963 --> 28:18.097
in my cerebellum.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.799
(laughing)

28:21.100 --> 28:23.335
What, are you laughing
at one of my jokes?

28:23.369 --> 28:25.471
I don't know what that means,
but you're super funny.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.940
I'm never leaving this lab.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.508
Well, you're going
to help us leave, at least,

28:29.541 --> 28:30.943
because if my calculations
are correct,

28:30.977 --> 28:33.412
we have three minutes
and two seconds

28:33.445 --> 28:35.481
until the plasma is launched.
(alarm sounding)

28:35.514 --> 28:38.284
I was wrong.
My calculations were off.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.518
We have zero seconds.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.520
I can't figure out
how this all plays out.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.023
Well, here's how it goes.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.959
Supercharged particles are
rocketing in opposite directions

28:46.993 --> 28:49.095
around the particle collider,
and at any minute,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.230
they might smash
into each other, possibly

28:51.263 --> 28:53.032
destroying the universe
as we know it, but

28:53.065 --> 28:54.133
definitely blowing
our butts off.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.202
Wow. Thank you for breaking
this down. This is bad.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.037
No! No!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.939
This is great!

28:59.972 --> 29:01.407
How the hell is this great?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.776
'Cause I'm the smartest one
on the team.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.245
Now you're the Tobys!

29:12.551 --> 29:14.086
Yes, you're smart again.
That was the plan

29:14.120 --> 29:16.055
so you could save us,
not so you could gloat.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.357
I can do both.
Quiet, dummy. Let me think.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.859
Okay.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.460
I got it.
You remember earlier

29:21.493 --> 29:25.531
when Sly was saying
how all this was super cool?

29:25.564 --> 29:27.233
Well, he's right.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.401
That argon in the WIMP detector
is stored at

29:29.435 --> 29:30.636
190 degrees below freezing.

29:30.669 --> 29:34.173
That's literally super cool,
and the collider is super hot.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.009
Cool... hot.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.945
Following.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.413
Mm-hmm, so if we can get
the argon to the collider,

29:41.447 --> 29:44.951
it'll super-cool the plasma
so the ions can no longer travel

29:44.984 --> 29:47.553
at a high energy,
thus eliminating their ability

29:47.586 --> 29:50.823
to form any kind
of explosion upon collision.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.327
Now I'm as lost
as Macaulay Culkin in New York.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.428
Who?

29:56.462 --> 29:57.596
Home Alone 2.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.998
I love that movie.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.432
I know, right?
Good as the original.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.534
Guys! Zip it, meatheads!
We gotta turn that

30:02.568 --> 30:04.103
argon ball into a big juice box.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.038
So we're gonna
puncture it

30:06.072 --> 30:08.307
with the empty hydrogen pipes,
and then steer freezing liquid

30:08.340 --> 30:10.877
argon through the piping system
into the collider room.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.912
Okay, we're gonna need
schematics

30:12.945 --> 30:14.847
for this wackadoo plan to work.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.182
Give me ten seconds.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.164
I'll print the schematics.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.401
Okay, Walt, grab a handsaw

30:35.434 --> 30:38.004
and then climb up the pipe
in the collider room.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.172
Cut it so it drops
toward the collider.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.074
The supply closet's
out there to your left.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.242
Copy that.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.143
(alarm continues blaring)

30:46.178 --> 30:47.246
Your other left!

30:47.279 --> 30:48.915
Sly, you see all

30:48.948 --> 30:51.083
the wheels along where
the pipe branches off?

30:51.117 --> 30:52.584
Those are baffles. You need

30:52.618 --> 30:54.386
to turn them off at
every pipe except the ones

30:54.420 --> 30:56.088
that go to the
collider room.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.124
Happy, you're with me.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.425
Whatever you say,
Professor.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.460
(alarm sounding)
(panting)

31:04.630 --> 31:06.332
(grunting)

31:06.365 --> 31:09.001
I can't get in! The door must
have locked automatically

31:09.035 --> 31:11.337
once the plasma was launched.
We're screwed!

31:13.372 --> 31:14.373
Pull!

31:16.208 --> 31:18.244
Oh, okay.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.950
Yep, collider's
at 100% capacity.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.256
How's it going, Walt?

31:30.289 --> 31:32.959
Argon river about to flow?

31:32.992 --> 31:36.095
Yeah, getting there.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.663
You know,

31:37.696 --> 31:40.032
speaking of rivers,

31:40.066 --> 31:42.301
Paige, maybe we can listen

31:42.334 --> 31:45.171
to "Moon River" tonight
if we get out of this?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.641
You can teach me
about the standards?

31:49.675 --> 31:52.144
Broaden my horizons a bit?

31:52.178 --> 31:54.146
Really?

31:54.180 --> 31:57.216
Um, okay.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.350
Redirecting
the hydrogen pipe now.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.019
Almost done.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.221
Okay, copy that. That was Raja.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.655
He's ten minutes out
with the miners.

32:03.689 --> 32:04.991
(grunts)

32:05.024 --> 32:06.192
Ready to go here.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.027
Sly, you finished?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.528
Sly?

32:09.561 --> 32:12.331
CABE:
What's going on?

32:12.364 --> 32:15.301
He's nodding.
Sly, they can't hear a nod.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.036
My "B."

32:17.069 --> 32:18.637
I'm done.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.706
Walter, status?

32:20.739 --> 32:22.341
I'll be done in two seconds.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.275
Release the argon.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.211
You sure we'll bust
through this thing?

32:25.244 --> 32:26.678
Yeah.
We're super strong, remember?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.147
Let's do it.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.355
(grunts)

32:36.388 --> 32:38.224
Walt, the force of the argon

32:38.257 --> 32:40.092
is gonna snap off the end
of that pipe,

32:40.126 --> 32:41.527
so make sure you get off

32:41.560 --> 32:43.429
before you cut
all the way through.
Huh?

32:44.330 --> 32:46.265
(screams)

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
Walter!

32:47.333 --> 32:48.767
(metal clangs, creaks)

32:48.800 --> 32:51.137
(panting)

32:51.170 --> 32:52.571
Oh!

32:55.174 --> 32:56.275
Guys!

32:56.308 --> 32:59.011
A little help here?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.180
Oh, God. If he lets go,

33:01.213 --> 33:02.581
he's gonna get burned alive
by the collider.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.150
And if he holds on,
when the argon

33:04.183 --> 33:06.252
goes through that pipe,
he's gonna freeze to death.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.229
On our way, Walt.
Swing out.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.597
Try to land away
from the collider.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.632
I'm 25 feet in the air.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.168
I'll break my ankles,

33:22.201 --> 33:24.036
and I won't be able to run away
when the argon hits.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.538
Not if we catch you.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.074
We're jocks now, remember?

33:28.107 --> 33:29.575
Use your super strength to swing

33:29.608 --> 33:31.777
like you're doing
a trapeze leap.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.445
How long until the argon
reaches him?

33:33.479 --> 33:36.048
There's your answer.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.149
Walter, the argon
is almost to you.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.284
You have to let go.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.485
We're not there yet!

33:39.518 --> 33:41.353
I can feel the pipe
getting colder.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.156
I have to jump.

33:55.867 --> 33:59.305
(coughs)
Oh, perfect ten, O'Brien.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.107
Much like your current IQ.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.774
Let's boogie.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.813
(coughing)

34:14.520 --> 34:16.688
It's working.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.493
(alarm stops blaring)

34:21.527 --> 34:23.362
(all coughing)

34:23.395 --> 34:25.531
(sighs) Well, we did it.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.733
(prairie dog chittering)

34:33.272 --> 34:35.407
Happy with yourself?

34:35.441 --> 34:38.310
Jerk.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.148
CABE:
There they are.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.416
TOBY: Nothing could be finer
than to be rescued by a miner.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.584
CABE:
Good job, guys.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.753
Hey, great job, smarty-pants.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.488
(laughs)

34:49.521 --> 34:50.822
Good job.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.224
I'm sorry about your lab.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.492
I blame the prairie dog.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.760
No, no. Insurance
will cover the damage.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.495
Most important,
our research was proven,

34:56.528 --> 34:59.165
and we have the data
stored in our server up here.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.500
Thank you, Scorpion.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.135
I'm glad you guys are safe.
WALTER:
More importantly,

35:03.169 --> 35:04.436
we're smart again.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.205
Pi to the 35th digit:

35:06.238 --> 35:08.607
3.141592....

35:08.640 --> 35:10.709
...65358979...

35:10.742 --> 35:12.678
...3238462...

35:12.711 --> 35:14.746
...6433.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.615
Backwards. 3346...

35:16.648 --> 35:18.517
SYLVESTER:
...2648...

35:18.550 --> 35:20.352
HAPPY:
...97985356...

35:20.386 --> 35:21.820
WALTER:
...295141.3.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.122
CABE:
Good work, team.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.761
Uh, we're back.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.630
Hey, Ralph.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.865
Florence. Good evening.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.235
I'm-I'm sorry
that we weren't reachable

35:36.268 --> 35:38.504
during your crisis.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.772
We had an amazing time at
the Chemistry Convention,

35:40.806 --> 35:43.209
but it sounds
like we missed out

35:43.242 --> 35:45.711
on almost maybe
seeing a black hole,

35:45.744 --> 35:47.779
which is infinitely cooler.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.248
SYLVESTER:
Well, if you have it in you

35:49.281 --> 35:50.682
to sit through one more demo,

35:50.716 --> 35:52.351
I'm about to show everybody
something.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.286
The drink station?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.622
I actually just engineered
this water filter.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.524
Uh, please,
if you'd do the honors.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.234
Ooh, that's quite good.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.635
Tastes like home.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.936
It's like a stream

36:10.969 --> 36:12.904
at my Grandpa Gallo's farm.

36:12.938 --> 36:13.905
Exactly.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.507
How did you do that?

36:15.541 --> 36:16.742
I researched
the chemical assays

36:16.775 --> 36:17.876
on your grandfather's farm

36:17.909 --> 36:19.645
online through the New York DWP.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.614
This filter adjusts
the compounds in water

36:22.648 --> 36:24.550
to match
the mineral compositions

36:24.583 --> 36:25.851
of that same stream,

36:25.884 --> 36:27.519
which is why it tastes
so delicious.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.788
Sly, that is amazing.

36:29.821 --> 36:30.956
Down in that lab,

36:30.989 --> 36:33.592
we solved things so simply.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.661
You explained things
to us so simply.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.365
I realized I had to simplify
my plastics plan.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.899
Instead of corralling
corporations

36:40.932 --> 36:42.701
to change their supply
of bottles,

36:42.734 --> 36:45.371
I focused on the demand.

36:45.404 --> 36:48.340
If I can get one of these
to every West Altadenian,

36:48.374 --> 36:50.576
they would choose to use
tap water over bottled

36:50.609 --> 36:53.245
simply because of the taste.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.646
Only question is,

36:54.680 --> 36:56.682
how do I make
this 43-pound filter

36:56.715 --> 36:58.717
scalable for mass production?

36:58.750 --> 37:00.419
Well, whatever the case,

37:00.452 --> 37:02.721
it's nice to have
your brain back, kid.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.391
You know,

37:05.424 --> 37:08.560
the science of water filtration
involves flocculation

37:08.594 --> 37:10.262
and coagulation.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.298
Isn't that your specialty,
Florence?

37:12.331 --> 37:13.599
Yes.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.534
We established that earlier.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.437
Well, then would you be able
to help Sylvester

37:18.470 --> 37:19.838
scale his water filter?

37:19.871 --> 37:22.574
Yeah, I suppose so.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.577
If you wouldn't mind me
helping you.

37:25.611 --> 37:26.978
Wow. That'd be great.
If you don't mind.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.647
That'd be great.
We can talk about it.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.282
I think it'd be great.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.618
Good-bye.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.721
(Sylvester grunts)

37:35.754 --> 37:36.855
(clears throat)

37:42.894 --> 37:45.864
Those all the doctors we saw?

37:45.897 --> 37:47.566
Most of them.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.735
I'm trying to narrow
the field of contenders.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.973
Hey, when we were
underground today,

37:55.006 --> 37:56.642
we had no smarts,

37:56.675 --> 37:58.410
and we had to do things

37:58.444 --> 38:01.380
with some guts and instinct,

38:01.413 --> 38:02.681
and it worked.

38:02.714 --> 38:06.518
Maybe overthinking
can be a problem sometimes.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.588
Who do you feel
is the right doctor?

38:11.623 --> 38:14.059
As unhappy as it would make
my alumni association,

38:14.092 --> 38:15.794
I want that doctor from Brown.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.764
Good. I do, too.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.033
I already made the appointment.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.736
Let's go, dum-dum.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.705
Time to play pharmacist.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.946
Oh, hey. Good news.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.782
I just read online
a singer I love

38:36.815 --> 38:38.817
is, um, performing standards
tonight at a great little club

38:38.850 --> 38:40.752
in Laurel Canyon.
We could get a sitter for Ralph.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.821
They might even do "Moon River."

38:42.854 --> 38:44.089
Well, that's very kind of you,
Paige, but, uh...

38:44.122 --> 38:45.757
(clears throat)
...I plan on working tonight.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.594
I've got a lot of low-IQ time
to make up for.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.596
I need to catch up
on some things,

38:50.629 --> 38:52.498
maybe stimulate
the cranium a bit.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.832
Oh, okay. I just....

38:53.865 --> 38:55.534
I just figured
that 'cause you said

38:55.567 --> 38:57.669
you wanted to learn
about old standards...

38:57.703 --> 38:59.137
I will. One day soon.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.841
But, uh, you know,
they're old standards, Paige.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.844
They're not going anywhere,
right?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.779
Right.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.862
I'll miss you, dopey Walter.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.903
Ralph, come on. Let's go.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.813
You know, Walter,
this is an impressive

39:41.847 --> 39:43.148
particle accelerator.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.984
Oh, thank you.
I'm building a new...

39:46.017 --> 39:48.019
Electronic feedback mechanism.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.721
Yes, I can see that.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.823
It's a cool design.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.426
You could tell
it was a feedback mechanism?

39:54.460 --> 39:55.694
Of course.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.696
Your drawing
was as clear as day.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.168
Though, if I'm not being
too bold...

40:13.745 --> 40:15.046
Closed circuit.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.182
Less easily bypassed.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.784
You can tell
that's what I'm going for?

40:18.817 --> 40:20.986
Oh, your drawing
was also clear as day.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.754
Uh, may I?
Of course.

40:27.726 --> 40:28.927
Yeah. Okay.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.563
And then perhaps
another injector.
Mm-hmm.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.932
Over... here.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.834
Fantastic.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.774
Yes. Okay.
