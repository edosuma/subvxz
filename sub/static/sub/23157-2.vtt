WEBVTT

00:01.483 --> 00:04.145
Halt!

00:06.988 --> 00:10.219
And watch his eyes.
He blinks before he strikes.

00:12.260 --> 00:14.319
The Chinese Communists
and Nationalists...

00:14.396 --> 00:15.920
would both give millions for it.

00:15.997 --> 00:18.329
And what, pray tell,
are you doing with this one?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.265
He has agreed
to be my protector.

00:22.337 --> 00:24.601
You hired Magnum?
He's my protector.

00:24.672 --> 00:26.833
He's your protect...

01:55.763 --> 01:59.790
Sailor, sir. Want a date? Want to really
have a good time? Couple of drinks, maybe?

02:05.139 --> 02:08.506
Sailor, how about it? Do you want
to know me, have a good time?

02:26.861 --> 02:29.659
Koko.

02:29.731 --> 02:33.064
Hey, Duffy.! Long time, no see.
When'd you dock?

02:33.134 --> 02:35.068
Midnight.

02:35.136 --> 02:38.162
Any me mates about? Not yet.

02:38.239 --> 02:40.639
But there's a malihini Pake
at number three.

03:16.444 --> 03:18.309
You Choi?

03:25.853 --> 03:28.321
Well, let's get to it.

03:28.389 --> 03:32.917
I was told in Hong Kong
that you'd pay 5,000 American...

03:32.994 --> 03:35.394
for the location of one Mai Ling.

03:36.397 --> 03:39.366
Since you're sittin' at my table,
I take it I was right.

03:48.443 --> 03:51.241
Oh, don't tell me, mate.
Don't tell me.

03:51.312 --> 03:53.644
Let me guess.
Which one of the arts is it?

03:53.715 --> 03:55.979
Uh, tae won do?

03:56.050 --> 03:59.315
Shotokan? Uh, kung fu?

03:59.387 --> 04:01.321
Shito-ryu?

04:01.389 --> 04:05.849
Whichever it is, it don't scare me none,
rice ball, 'cause I've fought 'em all,

04:05.927 --> 04:09.693
from Singapore to Yokohama,
and I ain't been whipped yet.

04:09.764 --> 04:11.891
So don't get cute,

04:11.966 --> 04:15.902
or I'll break your fingers
like they was chopsticks.

04:18.139 --> 04:20.107
Now,

04:21.108 --> 04:23.634
we was discussing Mai Ling.

04:23.711 --> 04:25.736
I know where she is.

04:25.813 --> 04:28.077
And for 5,000 American...

04:28.149 --> 04:30.583
and that bit of gold and jade
hanging round your neck,

04:30.651 --> 04:32.551
so can you.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.727
What is she to you anyway?

04:43.798 --> 04:45.789
Runaway wife?

04:47.869 --> 04:49.860
Sister?

04:51.005 --> 04:52.939
You don't talk much, do ya?

04:53.007 --> 04:55.635
But you sure do know
how to count.

04:56.778 --> 04:58.712
She's on Kauai.

04:58.780 --> 05:02.807
She runs an antique shop in Lihue.

05:02.884 --> 05:06.786
It's called Treasures of the Dove.
You cannot miss it.

05:24.038 --> 05:26.268
It's called wing chun.

05:41.689 --> 05:44.317
You know, Thomas,
chasing a China doll can be fun,

05:44.392 --> 05:46.622
if she wants to be caught.

05:46.694 --> 05:50.289
T.C., do you have to fly into the sun?

05:50.364 --> 05:53.299
Do I what?
Have to fly into the sun?

05:53.367 --> 05:56.268
I was out all night on a divorce case,
and I'm tired.

05:56.337 --> 05:59.101
Aw! Well, no, suh, massa, suh.

05:59.173 --> 06:02.142
Old T.C. sure is sorry
he let poor massa...

06:02.210 --> 06:05.509
let that sun shine on
his little beady bloodshot eyes.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.616
Ooh!

06:12.253 --> 06:15.689
- How's that, suh?
- Great.

06:15.756 --> 06:18.281
Oh! What the hell are they...

06:18.359 --> 06:20.793
But maybe you should talk to them.

06:20.862 --> 06:23.990
Uh,

06:24.065 --> 06:25.555
nothing to worry about.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.431
Just a slight, uh, Kauai downdraft.

06:28.503 --> 06:31.700
Uh, probably smooth sailing from now on.
Won't happen again.

06:31.772 --> 06:34.570
Just a Kauai downdraft, honey.
Won't happen again.

06:34.642 --> 06:37.338
Kauai downdraft? That's good.

06:37.411 --> 06:41.211
They upchuck all over my new upholstery,
guess who's gonna clean it, Thomas.

06:41.282 --> 06:44.012
Come on, T.C. What did I do?
What did you do?

06:44.085 --> 06:46.918
What did you do?
What you always do!

06:46.988 --> 06:48.956
I didn't care about the sun,

06:49.023 --> 06:52.322
but T.C. was gonna start in on Mai Ling
again, and I didn't want to hear it.

06:52.393 --> 06:56.921
Now, if you don't want someone on you about one
thing, you give them something else to gripe about.

06:56.998 --> 07:01.264
- It works every time.
- Of course, what should I expect...

07:01.335 --> 07:06.739
from a grown man who spends all of his
time chasing, of all things, a China doll.

07:06.807 --> 07:09.867
Well, almost every time.

07:09.944 --> 07:13.880
T.C., that China doll,
as you call her,

07:13.948 --> 07:16.712
happens to be an expert on ancient...

07:16.784 --> 07:18.581
Oriental ceramics.

07:18.653 --> 07:21.417
- She is teaching me all she knows.
- Mm-hmm.

07:21.489 --> 07:25.550
The only thing she is teaching you
is "" no" in Chinese.

07:25.626 --> 07:28.424
Since when are you interested
in who teaches what?

07:28.496 --> 07:31.090
Since it started costing me a paying fare
every time I fly to Kauai.

07:31.165 --> 07:33.599
Harold. Uh, pilot.

07:33.668 --> 07:35.863
Am I replacing a paying passenger?
Maybe.

07:35.937 --> 07:38.565
Is someone else gonna fly with you today?
Well, maybe.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.800
Look, Thomas,
I don't expect you to pay a fare,

07:40.875 --> 07:42.866
but once... if just once...

07:42.944 --> 07:44.707
you would offer
to give me gas money.

07:44.779 --> 07:46.303
That hurts, T.C.
That really hurts.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.940
When I think of all the times
I saved your butt in 'Nam.

07:49.016 --> 07:51.541
You saved my butt? Ha.!

07:51.619 --> 07:55.487
You got me confused with some other
beautiful human being, Thomas.

08:09.537 --> 08:13.598
Okay, uh, welcome to Kauai,
the G... Garden Island.

08:13.674 --> 08:16.666
The, uh, oldest island
in the Hawaiian chain.

08:16.744 --> 08:19.838
The first to be visited
by Captain Cook.

08:19.914 --> 08:23.247
Anything else you want to know, there's
a tour guide back there somewhere.

08:28.422 --> 08:31.823
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, are you sure you
won't reconsider and fly back with me?

08:31.892 --> 08:34.019
No. No. Not ever.

08:34.095 --> 08:37.155
I guess in that case you're entitled
to half your money back. Nah.

08:37.231 --> 08:39.289
But, you know, I'm a small operation.
That's okay.

08:39.366 --> 08:41.301
Fares like this...
Nah, forget it.

08:41.369 --> 08:43.667
I'm sorry. Come on, Alice.

08:43.738 --> 08:46.536
You... Maybe you might...
Well... Fi...

08:47.642 --> 08:49.633
I leave at 5:00.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.048
Not coming back with us, huh?

08:59.120 --> 09:01.486
Gas money. What?

09:03.157 --> 09:05.421
Thomas, I am going to
Monkey Pete's for a beer.

09:05.493 --> 09:09.759
When I get back, I want those gas tanks
topped off and the gas paid for.

09:09.830 --> 09:13.596
You got it? Don't you think you
ought to use a half hitch there?

09:17.104 --> 09:19.470
You can backstroke to Oahu.

09:22.443 --> 09:25.105
Well, if I had to be marooned,

09:25.179 --> 09:27.841
at least it was on Kauai...
with Mai Ling.

09:30.418 --> 09:32.409
Mai Ling.

09:38.993 --> 09:41.052
Ah.

09:41.128 --> 09:43.119
Mai Ling.

09:52.406 --> 09:55.398
Some days I shouldn't get out of bed.
Instead of Mai Ling,

09:55.476 --> 09:57.410
her Uncle Ho was in the shop.

09:57.478 --> 09:59.503
For all Ho ever said to me,
he could be mute.

09:59.580 --> 10:02.276
But then,
some people don't have to talk.

10:02.349 --> 10:04.283
Hi, Ho.

10:11.659 --> 10:14.025
Uh, is Mai Ling here?

10:14.095 --> 10:16.086
Ho?

10:17.331 --> 10:20.892
You know, I realize
that you're... very busy, but...

10:20.968 --> 10:23.869
if Mai Ling is here,
could you nod your head,

10:23.938 --> 10:26.031
blink or something?

10:26.107 --> 10:28.871
Ho?

10:28.943 --> 10:31.036
Ho.

10:40.387 --> 10:41.479
Mai Ling.

10:47.061 --> 10:49.256
I must apologize
for my appearance.

10:49.330 --> 10:52.197
Um, I was planting flowers
at my father's grave.

10:54.735 --> 10:57.727
I didn't expect you
until this afternoon.

10:57.805 --> 11:00.535
Uh, well, why were you
expecting me at all?

11:00.608 --> 11:03.634
Oh, you've come
every Saturday for a month now.

11:03.711 --> 11:05.941
I hoped today would be the same.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.072
And it is.

11:08.149 --> 11:10.811
Did you fly in with your friend?

11:10.885 --> 11:13.149
What's his name? T.C.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.812
T.C.

11:18.726 --> 11:21.194
Mai Ling.

11:21.262 --> 11:24.254
Mai Ling, um,
what the hell is going on here?

11:24.331 --> 11:27.664
I'm going to Oahu with you
for the weekend.

11:27.735 --> 11:29.259
You are?

11:29.336 --> 11:32.100
Of course, I intend to pay.

11:32.173 --> 11:34.164
What for?

11:34.241 --> 11:36.266
For your services.

11:39.713 --> 11:41.738
To protect the vase you're carrying...

11:41.816 --> 11:46.150
until I can deliver it to a buyer
flying from San Francisco Sunday.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.087
I assume you do that sort of thing.

11:49.156 --> 11:51.215
You are a private eye, aren't you?

11:51.292 --> 11:53.226
Well, I prefer "" private investigator."

11:54.228 --> 11:56.219
I also prefer to be asked.

12:02.469 --> 12:04.528
I'm so sorry.

12:07.708 --> 12:09.699
It was very stupid of me.

12:12.746 --> 12:16.182
Mai Ling, I... I didn't say no.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.980
I just said that I prefer to be asked.

12:23.324 --> 12:26.885
Then I humbly ask you...

12:26.961 --> 12:29.759
to be my protector,

12:29.830 --> 12:32.526
if that is a proper word,

12:32.600 --> 12:35.433
for the next two days and nights.

12:36.637 --> 12:39.435
Well, I don't know
if that's the proper word,

12:40.441 --> 12:42.432
but I accept.

12:44.044 --> 12:46.069
Oh. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

12:49.350 --> 12:51.341
Bye, Ho.

12:52.853 --> 12:55.754
I wasn't quite sure
what Mai Ling was up to,

12:55.823 --> 12:59.281
but how much trouble could I get into
protecting her and a little vase?

13:22.232 --> 13:24.462
Excuse me.
Treasures of the Dove?

13:31.241 --> 13:33.232
Ah. Thank you.

13:54.631 --> 13:57.896
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Mai Ling.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.231
There is no one by that name here.

14:06.843 --> 14:09.573
Do not lie to me.

14:11.281 --> 14:14.876
- Mai Ling.
- I know nothing of anyone... No!

14:16.820 --> 14:18.845
Mai Ling.

14:26.029 --> 14:28.054
Mai Ling.

14:28.131 --> 14:30.065
Oahu.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.067
And the Soul of Sung?

14:33.136 --> 14:36.469
With her! She took it with her.

14:40.777 --> 14:42.768
When?

15:26.990 --> 15:29.788
Steady.

15:41.905 --> 15:44.601
Now, lads.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.141
Mai Ling, how are you with animals?

15:56.219 --> 15:58.779
What kind of animals?

15:59.422 --> 16:01.117
That kind.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.278
Still in your jammies
at this hour?

16:27.350 --> 16:29.511
Zeus, Apollo. Patrol.

16:31.788 --> 16:35.189
Mai Ling, this is Higgins.
He kind of takes care of the place.

16:50.406 --> 16:53.739
I'll have an egg roll, the wonton soup
and the chicken with snow peas.

16:56.246 --> 17:00.615
And what, pray tell, are you doing with
this one? He has agreed to be my protector.

17:02.652 --> 17:05.382
Higgins. Higgins.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.719
I'm sorry, Magnum. Really, I...

17:07.790 --> 17:09.723
Higgins.!

17:09.791 --> 17:13.421
But the thought of you protecting
a beautiful woman, you must admit...

17:13.496 --> 17:15.691
Higgins.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.426
It's really rather funny.
Don't you think?

17:19.502 --> 17:21.732
No, I don't.

17:21.804 --> 17:24.238
Well, I do.

17:24.307 --> 17:26.935
At least, Mai Ling, you'll
be safe in the main house.

17:27.010 --> 17:29.103
Security is quite stringent,
with one exception.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.806
The only thing staying in the
main house will be this vase.

17:31.881 --> 17:34.315
Mai Ling will be in the
guesthouse with me. Vase?

17:34.384 --> 17:36.852
I'm staying with my Uncle Han in Kahala.
Uncle Han?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.514
What vase? The one Magnum is
protecting until tomorrow.

17:39.589 --> 17:42.217
You didn't say anything about an Uncle Han.
What kind of vase?

17:42.292 --> 17:44.260
Didn't I?
No. The only thing you said...

17:44.327 --> 17:46.318
was you needed
my protection day and night.

17:46.396 --> 17:50.162
Surely you didn't think I meant...
Yes, he did. Is the vase Chinese?

17:50.233 --> 17:53.100
Mai Ling, of course
I didn't think you meant...

17:53.169 --> 17:55.603
Of course. It's Chinese.
Which dynasty?

17:55.672 --> 17:57.902
- Mai Ling.
- That's not a dynasty.

17:57.974 --> 18:00.374
Sung.

18:00.443 --> 18:02.434
Sung?

18:02.512 --> 18:05.447
It's this way.

18:05.515 --> 18:09.918
Mai Ling, I hope you don't think that I
thought what you think I was thinking.

18:10.853 --> 18:12.912
Are you sure it's Sung? Yes.

18:12.989 --> 18:15.082
Must be worth a bloody fortune.

18:15.158 --> 18:17.285
Which is why I hired Magnum
to protect it.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.453
I never thought anything else.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.520
Honest.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.527
Ah. May I open it?

18:28.604 --> 18:30.538
No.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.636
Um, I'm merely an agent
in this transaction.

18:35.712 --> 18:37.873
The container was sealed
in the seller's presence.

18:37.947 --> 18:40.507
The seal cannot be broken
by anyone but the buyer.

18:40.583 --> 18:44.019
I'm sorry.
No, no. I quite understand.

18:45.088 --> 18:48.319
What, uh, color glaze?

18:49.492 --> 18:52.518
Blood red.
Oh, what a bloody shame.

18:53.796 --> 18:57.459
I'm sorry. I mean,
I would love to have seen...

18:57.533 --> 18:59.728
a Sung vase of that quality.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.400
Well, if we're not going to see it,

19:03.473 --> 19:05.998
then why don't we just
lock it in the safe?

19:07.543 --> 19:11.070
I can't open the safe until you leave the
room. It would be a breach of security.

19:12.148 --> 19:14.173
Shall I open it?

19:24.727 --> 19:26.718
This is intolerable!

19:48.518 --> 19:50.952
That combination will be changed
in the morning.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.319
How did you get it?
By watching you open the safe.

19:54.390 --> 19:58.019
When?
Just now, Higgins. Just now.

19:58.094 --> 20:00.255
Mai Ling, lunch.

20:12.675 --> 20:15.235
Excuse me, sir. Yeah.

20:15.311 --> 20:17.575
Did you just fly
some people to Kauai?

20:20.950 --> 20:23.214
Huh? A fare to Kauai.

20:24.220 --> 20:27.849
You need a flight to Kauai?
I mean, you want to fly Island Hoppers?

20:28.858 --> 20:31.850
You must be new here.
Hey, step into my office.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.935
Whoo-hoo.!

20:46.008 --> 20:49.102
One born every minute. Hoo-hoo!

20:49.178 --> 20:52.170
What was the bet again?
Fifty. Fifty.

20:52.248 --> 20:55.183
Bucks?
No, pesos. They bet pesos in Hawaii.

20:55.251 --> 20:57.185
Can you believe him?

20:58.187 --> 21:00.553
What is this? What are you doing?
I'm writing my marker.

21:00.623 --> 21:04.525
A marker? What do you think this is, Guys and
Dolls? Ever hear of cash? I'm a little short, Rick.

21:04.594 --> 21:08.052
Oh, I owe you for two days, plus expenses.
Mai Ling, that's all right.

21:08.131 --> 21:10.065
I insist. Please. Let me.
No, it's fine.

21:10.133 --> 21:13.159
Wait a minute. You hired Magnum?
He's my protector.

21:13.236 --> 21:15.227
He's your protect...

21:18.674 --> 21:21.768
How about a walk on the beach
before lunch, Mai Ling?

21:23.513 --> 21:26.380
He's been that way since 'Nam.
He's... Happens all of a sudden.

21:26.449 --> 21:29.213
One minute he's fine.
The next thing, he snaps.

21:31.187 --> 21:33.382
A protector!

21:36.425 --> 21:38.450
You have unusual friends.

21:38.528 --> 21:40.553
I guess you could call Rick that.

21:40.630 --> 21:44.361
Not just Rick. T.C., Higgins.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.197
I wouldn't exactly call
Higgins a friend.

21:47.270 --> 21:51.502
Anyway, none of them are what they
seem to be on the surface, are they?

21:51.574 --> 21:56.511
I mean, I've only briefly met them,
but underneath, I sense something...

21:56.579 --> 21:59.810
adventurous,
perhaps even dangerous.

21:59.882 --> 22:02.248
Especially in you.

22:02.318 --> 22:05.651
It's what makes you so, uh, exciting.

22:05.721 --> 22:07.621
You find me exciting? Very.

22:07.690 --> 22:11.387
Then why are you running away
from me to your Uncle Han's?

22:11.460 --> 22:14.952
Perhaps I, too, like to be asked.
Perhaps.

22:15.031 --> 22:19.434
And perhaps you're just a beautiful woman
who knows how to use flattery on a man.

22:22.004 --> 22:24.097
I don't think I like
what you're implying.

22:24.173 --> 22:26.505
And I don't like to be lied to.

22:28.010 --> 22:31.002
I don't know whether there was a
Sung vase in that box or not,

22:31.080 --> 22:33.571
but I do know you lied to Higgins
about the seal.

22:33.649 --> 22:37.779
I watched your Cousin Ho seal that box in
the antique shop just before you came in.

22:37.853 --> 22:41.846
- There is a valuable vase in the box.
- Then why'd you lie to Higgins?

22:41.924 --> 22:44.757
Thomas, there are things
I cannot explain.

22:44.827 --> 22:47.694
Try me. Perhaps tomorrow.

22:47.763 --> 22:50.357
No. Not tomorrow. Right now.

22:51.968 --> 22:54.061
Tomorrow.

22:56.072 --> 22:58.063
Tomorrow.

23:27.203 --> 23:31.162
Magnum.! Magnum.! Magnum.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.334
It's T.C., brah. He's hurt bad.

23:50.042 --> 23:53.273
Take it easy. You got a couple of
cracked ribs. Lie back.

23:53.345 --> 23:56.212
T.C., you okay? No.

23:56.281 --> 23:58.249
What happened?

23:58.317 --> 24:00.649
You're in big trouble, boy.
Yeah, he's in big trouble.

24:00.719 --> 24:03.984
You got cracked ribs and a concussion,
and he's in big trouble.

24:04.056 --> 24:05.990
All right. Look out.

24:07.159 --> 24:09.559
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

24:09.628 --> 24:11.459
Shouldn't you get him to a doctor?

24:11.530 --> 24:14.931
Snow pea, I've patched and stitched
these two jokers so many times in 'Nam,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.468
I know 'em better
than their mamas.

24:17.536 --> 24:19.800
- What kind of trouble?
- I don't know.

24:19.872 --> 24:21.806
But I could guess.

24:21.874 --> 24:24.001
A Chinese dude,

24:24.076 --> 24:28.137
Rick's size, asking who I brought in
from Kauai and where he could find them.

24:28.213 --> 24:30.841
- Did you tell him?
- Does it look like I did?

24:30.916 --> 24:33.851
He did this?
A Chinese guy about my size?

24:33.919 --> 24:38.185
He caught me by surprise. Man, I ain't
never seen nothing like this boy.

24:38.257 --> 24:41.590
He just blinked and boom.
Never saw him move.

24:41.660 --> 24:44.629
T.C., I've seen you whip
half a dozen guys in a bar fight.

24:44.696 --> 24:47.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I must be getting slow.

24:47.199 --> 24:50.464
Just wham, bam. The whole
thing only took five seconds.

24:50.536 --> 24:52.595
I'm just surprised he didn't kill me.

24:52.671 --> 24:55.697
What did he look like?
Like I said,

24:55.774 --> 24:59.335
Chinese dude, Rick's size, late 20s.

25:01.113 --> 25:05.209
Oh, yeah. He had something tattooed
in the palms of his hands.

25:05.284 --> 25:07.718
A red dragon?

25:09.054 --> 25:11.989
Yeah. Yeah, I think it was.

25:14.092 --> 25:15.992
You know who he is?

25:16.061 --> 25:18.120
I know what he is.

25:18.197 --> 25:20.165
I must get to my Uncle Han.

25:20.232 --> 25:22.632
Not till you explain
what the hell's going on here.

25:22.701 --> 25:25.602
I'll explain in the car.

25:25.671 --> 25:28.299
I'm so sorry for the pain I've caused you.

25:28.373 --> 25:31.536
- You didn't cause it.
- Yes, I'm afraid I did.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.703
Please, can we go?

25:33.779 --> 25:35.713
Anything he wants, Rick,
it's on me.

25:35.781 --> 25:37.681
What are you gonna pay with?
Your marker?

25:37.749 --> 25:40.240
- Anything, Rick.
- Okay.

25:42.788 --> 25:44.779
Phew.

25:47.659 --> 25:50.526
Chinese dude about my size?

25:50.596 --> 25:52.791
Don't get cute, Orville.

26:04.209 --> 26:06.871
Well?

26:08.614 --> 26:11.014
The dragon tattoo is a sign of the tong.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.883
On the palm, it signifies
a wing chun warrior of the first degree.

26:14.953 --> 26:17.922
Some people believe
such a man can kill with a look.

26:19.291 --> 26:21.282
Only women can do that, Mai Ling.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.227
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

26:24.296 --> 26:28.756
You know, I am involved in whatever is going
on here because I went slightly nuts over you,

26:28.834 --> 26:32.930
which is really pretty stupid considering
our entire relationship consists of a...

26:33.005 --> 26:36.406
a single kiss on Waikiki in front of
a couple thousand tourists.

26:36.475 --> 26:38.568
Now, I do stupid things occasionally,

26:38.644 --> 26:41.204
and that's okay as long as
I'm the only one who's hurt.

26:41.280 --> 26:45.546
But my friend in there has
a couple of busted ribs and a cracked head,

26:45.617 --> 26:49.553
and before somebody gets killed,
I think you better start filling me in.

27:09.975 --> 27:12.569
Some people have already
been killed.

27:12.644 --> 27:14.578
By who? The man with the tattoo?

27:14.646 --> 27:16.477
And others who came before him.

27:16.548 --> 27:18.641
It's that vase, isn't it?

27:18.717 --> 27:20.617
What's it worth?

27:20.686 --> 27:23.519
As an art object,
perhaps 100,000.

27:23.588 --> 27:27.991
As a symbol, the Chinese Communists and
Nationalists would both give millions for it.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.528
Have you ever heard of the Soul of Sung?

27:30.595 --> 27:34.087
No.
I'm sure your friend Higgins has.

27:34.166 --> 27:36.293
Oh, well, of course Higgins has.

27:36.368 --> 27:41.704
It's a vase containing the ashes
of a great Sung emperor, Hui Tsung.

27:41.773 --> 27:45.834
It disappeared shortly after the death
of the last empress of China,

27:45.911 --> 27:48.141
Tzu Hsi in 1908. Mai Ling,

27:48.213 --> 27:52.081
what the hell does this have to do with this
guy who's chasing you all over the Islands?

27:52.150 --> 27:56.951
On her deathbed, the empress gave
the Soul of Sung to a courtier.

27:57.022 --> 28:00.822
She made him swear upon
his family name to protect it...

28:00.892 --> 28:03.759
until another royal dynasty sat again...

28:03.829 --> 28:05.956
once more upon the throne in China.

28:06.031 --> 28:08.363
Of course. It's all very clear to me now.

28:09.434 --> 28:13.393
That courtier was my great-grandfather.

28:15.207 --> 28:17.198
He died protecting that vase.

28:17.275 --> 28:22.076
As did my father
and 10 others in the family.

28:22.147 --> 28:25.548
Perhaps, by now, 11.

28:25.617 --> 28:27.847
Cousin Ho?

28:27.919 --> 28:30.183
I will know more
when we reach my uncle.

28:31.323 --> 28:34.053
Next street. Turn left.

28:46.972 --> 28:50.169
My family's alone in this, Thomas.

28:50.242 --> 28:52.608
We must carry on
as the empress instructed.

28:52.677 --> 28:54.645
Now that I have been located,

28:54.713 --> 28:56.704
my Cousin Pin will take over.

28:56.782 --> 28:58.750
He's the one flying in tomorrow.

28:58.817 --> 29:02.014
You know, you could've told me, Mai Ling.

29:03.121 --> 29:05.919
I can trust no one outside the family.

29:05.991 --> 29:08.687
I only tell you now
because I have no choice.

29:09.694 --> 29:13.027
I would die to protect the Soul of Sung.
Would you?

29:35.687 --> 29:37.678
Mai Ling.

29:58.110 --> 30:00.806
Uh, Mai Ling. English, please.

30:00.879 --> 30:02.813
Uncle Han does not speak English.

30:02.881 --> 30:05.213
Well, how about French then? No.

30:05.283 --> 30:07.877
Vietnamese? No. Only Mandarin.

30:07.953 --> 30:10.217
Only Mandarin. Of course.

30:22.601 --> 30:25.263
Hi, guy. You speak English, hmm?

30:25.337 --> 30:29.774
Ah. Of course. Only Mandarin.

30:31.276 --> 30:33.710
There you go.
Come on, little birdie.

30:44.256 --> 30:46.190
You like that? No.

30:57.869 --> 31:01.532
The tong murdered a merchant sailor
last night on Hotel Street.

31:01.606 --> 31:04.871
This sailor knew of my shop on Kauai,
but not of this place.

31:04.943 --> 31:06.911
So I'm safe for the moment.

31:06.978 --> 31:09.242
What about your cousin?

31:09.314 --> 31:11.544
Uncle Han knows nothing.

31:11.616 --> 31:15.882
Cousin Ho will contact us here
if he's still alive.

31:15.954 --> 31:18.320
Thomas,

31:18.390 --> 31:20.722
guard the vase closely tonight.

31:20.792 --> 31:24.728
I'm staying with you.
I'm safe here.

31:24.796 --> 31:27.731
Tomorrow, when my Cousin Pin arrives,

31:27.799 --> 31:30.029
we will give him the vase...

31:30.101 --> 31:32.865
and then you can be with me.

31:32.938 --> 31:36.738
Until then, the vase is
the only thing that matters.

31:36.808 --> 31:38.503
Not to me.

31:38.577 --> 31:40.511
But to me.

31:41.513 --> 31:44.607
And therefore
it should be so to you too.

31:44.683 --> 31:46.674
There'll be tomorrow.

31:57.262 --> 32:00.095
At least we're cutting down
on the size of the crowd.

32:01.933 --> 32:04.265
I'll be back... tonight.

32:37.636 --> 32:40.161
I didn't like leaving Mai Ling,

32:40.238 --> 32:43.799
but I had to warn Higgins that a tong
warrior might show up to bust his ribs,

32:43.875 --> 32:46.343
which was something
that was still bugging me.

32:47.412 --> 32:50.472
A tong would either walk away or kill.
He wouldn't cripple.

32:52.150 --> 32:54.345
Not unless he needed T.C. alive.

32:58.390 --> 33:00.950
You damn fool.
He was following you.

33:56.014 --> 33:58.005
Han?

33:58.083 --> 34:00.176
Mai Ling? Mai Ling.

34:01.186 --> 34:03.780
The note was short and to the point.

34:03.855 --> 34:06.255
Mai Ling for the Soul of Sung.

34:06.324 --> 34:08.815
Noon tomorrow.
The location was a pay phone on Waikiki.

34:08.893 --> 34:11.384
He didn't bother to threaten.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.755
He didn't have to.

34:22.072 --> 34:24.371
I'll get her back.

34:24.442 --> 34:27.206
I'll get her back.

34:42.427 --> 34:46.955
Housing costs surged up by 1.5 percent
for the third consecutive month in a row.

34:57.609 --> 35:00.339
Higgins wasn't around
when I went for the vase,

35:00.412 --> 35:02.778
so I opened the safe,
ran from the dogs...

35:02.847 --> 35:06.613
and spent the rest of the night
at Rick's setting things up.

35:06.684 --> 35:10.142
The tong warrior would
set up the swap in his favor.

35:10.221 --> 35:13.156
All I could do was
try and outguess him, then wait.

35:14.159 --> 35:16.150
And wait.

35:16.227 --> 35:18.957
He said noon, and it was already 2:00.

35:19.030 --> 35:23.126
I was broiling. And I had the feeling
that's exactly what he wanted.

35:33.178 --> 35:36.670
- Yeah.
- Walk Diamond Head.

35:36.748 --> 35:38.841
Wait a minute. Wait.

36:12.350 --> 36:16.446
I didn't exactly panic,
but I was glad I hadn't had lunch.

36:20.391 --> 36:23.451
Where is she, hotshot?

36:23.528 --> 36:25.792
On the beach.

36:25.864 --> 36:27.957
The other way.

36:29.701 --> 36:32.864
If you leave the sand with her
before I have the vase,

36:32.937 --> 36:35.132
you're both dead.

36:35.206 --> 36:37.140
Where is it?

36:37.208 --> 36:39.142
It's the corner of Kalakaua and Ohua.

36:39.210 --> 36:41.974
There's a blue Paradise Pedicab
next to a grass shack.

36:42.046 --> 36:44.810
The driver'll take you to the vase.

36:51.956 --> 36:55.483
To put Mai Ling on the beach,
he'd have brought her out before dawn.

36:55.560 --> 37:00.691
That meant she'd been in the sun for eight, maybe
nine hours, probably drugged... with no liquids.

37:00.765 --> 37:03.666
I had to find her. Fast.

37:27.792 --> 37:30.522
Hey, driver.
How much to Diamond Head, huh?

37:30.595 --> 37:32.529
I'm on a tanning break, sir.
A what?

37:32.597 --> 37:34.758
What? I never heard of
such a thing.

37:34.832 --> 37:37.630
Look, lady, will you move along?
My cab's not for hire. Come on.

37:37.702 --> 37:40.193
I think we should report
this to the police. For why?

37:40.271 --> 37:43.900
This is a public vehicle. This is licensed for
the public to use. Whoa, whoa. Lady, lady.

37:43.975 --> 37:46.136
Take a regular cab.
It's faster, and it's air conditioned.

37:46.210 --> 37:48.041
Thank you. Come on. Give it ba...

37:48.112 --> 37:50.046
Al... Come on. Alice.

37:50.114 --> 37:53.242
Might as well take it.
That's all right. What if...

37:53.318 --> 37:55.286
I'm not gonna turn it down.

37:55.353 --> 37:58.413
If he gave it to me,
I'm gonna take it.

37:58.489 --> 38:00.719
What are you doing? I'm not
gonna give it back to him.

38:00.792 --> 38:03.761
He's a meshuggener.
Give it back to him. You're crazy.

38:20.478 --> 38:22.469
Mai Ling.

38:54.612 --> 38:56.739
Mai Ling. Mai Ling?

38:58.549 --> 39:00.676
Mai Ling.

39:00.752 --> 39:05.382
Wait a minute. Wait. Uh... Uh, put that
down and shade her. Yeah. Just like that.

39:05.456 --> 39:07.890
I need an ambulance and some water.

39:07.959 --> 39:09.893
Mai Ling?

39:09.961 --> 39:11.986
Mai Ling?

39:15.800 --> 39:17.859
It's all right, Mai Ling.

39:17.935 --> 39:20.426
It's over... and you're safe.

39:43.494 --> 39:45.587
Under the seat there's a box.

40:10.655 --> 40:14.147
Okay, we're even now, pal.
You got the vase. We got Mai Ling.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.138
Not quite.

40:31.542 --> 40:35.103
- That could've been my head.
- What head?

40:35.179 --> 40:38.239
Come on, Higgins.
Lay off Orville.

40:38.316 --> 40:41.649
He... He darn near busted a gut
running away from that tong.

40:41.719 --> 40:43.778
Real funny. Let me tell you
something, you big lug.

40:43.855 --> 40:48.292
After what he did to that vase, I wasn't about to hang
around and play ring-around-the-rosy until you showed up.

40:49.727 --> 40:51.752
And besides, he was bigger than me.

40:51.829 --> 40:54.491
Oh, I think you did great, Rick.

40:54.565 --> 40:57.557
And you were supposed to land
and give him a hand, T.C.

40:57.635 --> 41:01.230
Man, Orville pedaled
so far into the forest,

41:01.305 --> 41:03.398
I had to park in a parking lot
a half a mile away,

41:03.474 --> 41:06.341
and I don't run too good
with busted ribs.

41:07.678 --> 41:09.771
This vase is a reproduction.

41:11.549 --> 41:14.382
- You mean it's a fake?
- I didn't say that. I said...

41:17.188 --> 41:20.248
I said it was a reproduction.
There's a difference, you know.

41:21.859 --> 41:24.293
No, you wouldn't.

41:24.362 --> 41:27.593
This vase was thrown
sometime during the 15th century.

41:27.665 --> 41:29.860
It's a Ming copy of the Sung original.

41:29.934 --> 41:32.027
Probably commissioned
by a member of the royal court.

41:32.103 --> 41:34.003
So it was valuable, huh?

41:34.071 --> 41:38.531
Well, it's no Soul of Sung, but in one piece
it would have been worth 50,000 or 60,000.

41:38.609 --> 41:41.203
Bucks? Pounds.

41:43.581 --> 41:47.017
I shall never forgive Mai Ling
for not letting me see it.

41:47.084 --> 41:48.984
Well, she couldn't risk it.

41:49.053 --> 41:50.816
What?

41:50.888 --> 41:53.482
Well, she knew all along
the tong would be following us.

41:53.558 --> 41:55.992
I mean, she even set it up
so that he could.

41:56.060 --> 41:58.654
Yeah, man,
but why would she do that?

41:58.729 --> 42:00.458
To buy time.

42:02.300 --> 42:06.669
Time for her Cousin Pin to fly in to the
Islands and escape with the real Soul of Sung.

42:06.737 --> 42:11.367
Now, if she'd let Higgins see the vase,
he might've recognized it as a fake.

42:11.442 --> 42:13.376
- A reproduction.
- Whatever.

42:13.444 --> 42:18.848
Anyway, she couldn't risk anyone knowing that the
vase inside the box wasn't the real Soul of Sung.

42:18.916 --> 42:22.010
If the tong found out, he would've
known where the real vase was hidden.

42:22.086 --> 42:24.054
Where?

42:25.022 --> 42:26.990
Right where she led him away from.

42:27.058 --> 42:28.889
Kauai.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.834
What'd the hospital say?

42:37.902 --> 42:40.097
A couple days rest
and she'd be fine.

42:40.171 --> 42:44.005
You talk to her?
No, she was still pretty doped up.

42:44.075 --> 42:46.075
I should have known
something was wrong with her...

42:46.143 --> 42:49.909
the minute she pretended she wanted
to spend the weekend with you.

42:49.981 --> 42:52.040
Come on, T.C.
She hired me to protect the vase.

42:52.116 --> 42:54.084
I didn't think
she wanted to sleep with me.

42:54.151 --> 42:56.244
Oh, you didn't, huh?

42:56.320 --> 42:58.379
Well, not exactly. See, I mean...

42:58.456 --> 43:00.686
just the way she walked into
the antique shop...

43:00.758 --> 43:03.022
Mm-hmm.

43:03.094 --> 43:07.554
And the cute little way
she apologized for her hands being dirty.

43:14.338 --> 43:16.533
- Up! Take us up!
- Huh?

43:16.607 --> 43:19.075
Take us up.!

43:19.143 --> 43:22.010
She wasn't planting flowers.
She was hiding the vase.

43:41.899 --> 43:43.992
There he is!

43:44.068 --> 43:46.559
No place to land, Thomas.

43:50.741 --> 43:53.175
Behind those trees.
Uh, put her down. I'll jump.

43:53.244 --> 43:55.144
All right. It's your funeral.

43:56.814 --> 43:59.510
Hey, Thomas.
Don't be no hero, man.

43:59.583 --> 44:04.316
Use the .45. Watch his eyes.
He blinks before he strikes.

44:15.099 --> 44:19.627
By the time I hit the ground, I had so much
adrenaline pumping I wasn't even scared.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.308
Well, not too scared.

45:12.223 --> 45:14.123
Halt!

45:19.497 --> 45:21.465
Turn around.

45:24.335 --> 45:26.303
Down.

45:39.016 --> 45:41.109
You're not a tong.

45:42.686 --> 45:46.349
Pin Ling?

46:09.280 --> 46:11.180
Don't even think it.

46:11.248 --> 46:13.113
Nobody's that fast.

46:29.867 --> 46:31.455
What is it, Magnum?

46:32.027 --> 46:35.414
Oh, we just thought we'd come by
and see how you were doing.

46:37.515 --> 46:39.779
Ah. Mai Ling.

46:42.713 --> 46:44.388
Oh, no. No, no.

46:44.413 --> 46:46.677
I know you both speak English.

46:46.702 --> 46:49.364
It is impolite of us
to converse in Chinese.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.591
I wanted to apologize
for having lied to you about the vase.

46:57.616 --> 46:59.607
I quite understand.

46:59.632 --> 47:02.362
May I offer my condolences
on the death of your Cousin Ho.

47:03.449 --> 47:05.453
That is most appreciated.

47:05.478 --> 47:07.378
Is the Soul of Sung safe?

47:07.999 --> 47:09.503
For the moment.

47:09.528 --> 47:11.928
My Cousin Pin has
departed with it.

47:11.953 --> 47:13.200
Good.

47:13.988 --> 47:17.981
I hope you don't mind. I've been trying
to piece this Ming version back together.

47:18.253 --> 47:19.982
This is very good.

47:20.735 --> 47:24.034
During the war I was attached to the
British Museum in Cairo for a brief stint.

47:24.059 --> 47:26.584
Learned a thing or two.
You never told me that.

47:27.415 --> 47:29.713
I don't tell you many things.

47:29.738 --> 47:32.866
Which reminds me. The combination
to the safe has been changed...

47:33.127 --> 47:34.942
to keep undesirables out.

47:34.967 --> 47:39.404
Well, a dinner for two at the club says I
can get in and out without you knowing it.

47:40.021 --> 47:41.398
Impossible.

47:41.423 --> 47:42.720
- Is it a bet?
- It's a bet.

47:42.881 --> 47:46.078
Come along, Mai Ling.
Dinner is on Higgins tonight.

47:46.103 --> 47:48.333
You'll have to get into
the safe first, Magnum.

47:52.067 --> 47:53.967
I know.

48:33.958 --> 48:35.858
Zeus,

48:36.051 --> 48:37.951
Apollo,

48:38.880 --> 48:40.780
kill!
