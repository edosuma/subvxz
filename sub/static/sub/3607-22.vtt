01:47.608 --> 01:49.525
Hi.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.987
I'm expecting a letter.
"Hold for guest arrival."

01:53.071 --> 01:55.573
- Sure, what's your name?
- Joan Hart.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.660
Joan Hart.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.370
Platinum.

02:44.623 --> 02:45.998
Platinum?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.210
As in platinum record.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.671
As in a million units sold.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.092
Now, Drive Shaft's albums must've...

02:56.176 --> 02:59.095
...spiked when everybody
found out that I died

02:59.179 --> 03:01.973
in some catastrophic plane disaster.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.433
But when I come back?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.811
Alive!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.646
It's gonna be insane.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.483
So, you think the raft's gonna work?

03:12.568 --> 03:14.402
Of course. Look at that thing.

03:14.486 --> 03:18.322
It's not a raft.
They built a sodding boat.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.535
When they get picked up,
the helicopters will come,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.495
making us ridiculously

03:24.580 --> 03:27.331
and eternally famous.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.209
What's the matter?

03:30.294 --> 03:32.128
Don't you want to be famous?

03:33.297 --> 03:36.173
...what I think. But the fact is...

03:36.258 --> 03:38.718
What do you think's going on over there?

03:39.678 --> 03:44.056
Sure. You can absolutely wait
a few weeks before you launch.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.475
I was just assuming you
didn't want to die.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.024
So, when's the next time
we can launch?

03:53.108 --> 03:57.111
- Three... maybe four months.
- Come on!

03:57.195 --> 04:00.239
Even a weatherman on TV
don't know what's gonna happen.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.241
Why are we listening to Arzt?

04:02.326 --> 04:05.286
Because I'm a doctor
and you're a hillbilly.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.747
You're a damn
high school science teacher.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.666
Hey, Sawyer,
let's just let the man talk.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.752
It's been raining every afternoon.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.339
That means that we are on
the cusp of monsoon season.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.761
Monsoon season is bad. Now,

04:21.845 --> 04:26.098
the trade winds are
blowing north right now.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.934
Shipping lanes are north.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.187
So north is exactly
where you want to be.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.271
What's that mean?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.941
It means, when the monsoon season hits,

04:35.025 --> 04:38.611
the trade winds
are gonna shift to the south.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.614
The raft goes with the wind.

04:41.698 --> 04:46.535
Can anyone tell me what is the only
piece of land that's south of us?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.287
Antarctica.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.998
That's right, Jack. Antarctica.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.667
So when do we have to leave?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.045
Yesterday.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.139
So, obviously you believe him.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.643
Arzt? I don't know.
But I'm not taking any chances.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.895
You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?

05:13.522 --> 05:14.981
Man said not a day to waste.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.025
Supplies all set?
You got food, fresh water, every...

05:18.110 --> 05:20.695
Look, Kate, no offense,
but I got work to do.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.363
Why the sudden interest?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.907
Because I'm going with you.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.850
Look, raft's full.
We need four, we got four.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.144
- Including Sawyer?
- Including him.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.980
We needed the stuff he had,
so he bought his way on.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.773
On the first raft which burned.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.692
I'm not gonna get into semantics.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.236
- I told the guy...
- He doesn't know how to sail.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.362
You do?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.406
I spent two summers crewing J/boats.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.616
I know my way around a sailboat.

06:07.784 --> 06:13.039
Yeah... maybe so,
but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.791
You're bringing Walt too?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.462
I'm just saying it's dangerous.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.381
I decide what's best for my boy.

06:22.466 --> 06:26.427
And right now, what's best for him
is to get the hell off this island.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.054
The raft's full.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.729
Hospital chaplain to the ICU.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.648
Hospital chaplain.
Please report to the ICU.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.488
I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.656
Right.
She just came up from ICU.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.200
- She's in room 208.
- OK.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.118
Around the corner, to your right.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.745
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:27.989 --> 07:28.989
Hey, Tom.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.411
Holy... Katie?

07:36.373 --> 07:37.706
What are you doing here?

07:39.334 --> 07:41.335
Diane's dying of cancer.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.381
I thought I owed it to her
to come see her.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.468
I heard. I'm sorry.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.804
Yeah, me too.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.852
So, any particular reason why you're
hanging out in the back of my car?

08:01.565 --> 08:03.315
I need your help.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.937
How much further?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.647
We're almost there.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.816
Wanna tell me where we're going, Sayid?

08:45.901 --> 08:48.027
It's better that you see it for yourself.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.862
No, I'm not so sure it is.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.364
Tell me why you brought me here
or I turn around.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.701
He brought you out here
because I asked him to.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.787
I asked him not to tell you.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.916
I wanted you to have an open mind.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.834
Open mind about what?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.993
My God.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.621
What is this thing?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.498
Exactly.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.336
I guess it's time we talked about this.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.597
Yo, chief!

09:59.015 --> 10:02.226
Dumb question here.
We're sailing out on the ocean right?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.435
You mind?

10:03.520 --> 10:07.606
Sulu over here is packing
a suitcase full of salted fish.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.857
Yeah?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.110
We can't catch fish?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.946
Do you know anything
about surviving at sea?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.406
Sailing? Navigating?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.450
- Steering a raft?
- Do you?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.703
Doesn't matter what I know, I built it.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.331
Maybe you are the wrong guy
to go on the raft.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.959
You gonna vote me off, Mickey?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.841
And who the hell's gonna take my place?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.186
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- Sorry?

10:46.271 --> 10:48.063
Don't give me the "Aw, golly" eyes.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.567
Michael just told me you were
jockeying for my spot on the raft.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.321
I was just asking some questions.
He must've misunderstood me.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.865
I know what you're doing.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.491
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:59.576 --> 11:03.078
Just like I know why you wanted
that Haliburton case so bad.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.915
The one that belonged to the U.S. Marshal
who was flying with us.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.585
You were his prisoner.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.628
Let go of me.

11:12.756 --> 11:16.175
Your only chance of running's
getting on that raft, ain't it?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.930
If we get picked up by a ship,

11:22.015 --> 11:24.808
when they come back
to rescue the rest of y'all,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.395
gonna be a nice big asterisk
next to your name.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.068
Well, don't worry, puddin',

11:34.152 --> 11:36.278
your secret's safe with me.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.947
But just so you know,

11:39.032 --> 11:42.326
no way in hell you're getting
my spot on that raft.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.207
Hey, Sawyer!

11:49.793 --> 11:54.046
I want your spot, I'll get your spot.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.811
Hey! Give me that water, man.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.318
- Yo, Dad!
- Thanks.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.534
So, what were you
and Sawyer arguing about?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.994
I told him something
he didn't want to hear.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.331
Why does he wanna get on
the raft so much?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.084
'Cause he knows it's gonna work.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.128
When we get rescued,

12:34.212 --> 12:36.964
we're gonna come back
for everybody else, right?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.842
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.593
But the thing is...

12:41.678 --> 12:43.846
...this island...

12:46.850 --> 12:49.935
...is... finding it again might be hard.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.771
Can't we fly around and look for it?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.107
Absolutely.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.403
But there's no guarantees.
That's why you and...

12:59.863 --> 13:00.946
Dad?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.036
That's why... you and...

13:12.542 --> 13:13.709
Dad!

13:14.669 --> 13:16.670
- Dad!
- Get Jack.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.561
Help!

13:33.688 --> 13:35.481
I need help! It's my dad.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.942
- What's the matter?
- His stomach is really bad.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.277
Take him back to Michael.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.488
- I'll go get Jack.
- OK.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.698
- Let's go.
- This way.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.034
Jack!

13:55.335 --> 13:57.503
How long have you known about this?

13:58.922 --> 14:00.589
Three weeks, give or take.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.798
Three weeks.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.801
You've been out here for three weeks
digging this thing up

14:04.886 --> 14:05.969
and you never told me?

14:06.429 --> 14:09.932
All due respect, Jack,
but since when do I report to you?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.935
All due respect, John, but you lied.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.690
How long did you have
that case full of guns

14:18.775 --> 14:21.193
before you decided the
rest of us needed to know?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.738
You used your best discretion.
I used mine.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.578
So how do we open it?

14:31.663 --> 14:34.456
What? You want to open it?

14:35.583 --> 14:36.625
Yeah.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.503
We should bury it.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.047
I brought you here to
talk him out of this insanity.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.384
- Anything could be inside.
- Best case scenario, supplies.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.219
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.305
Actually, Jack, I can think
of much worse cases than that.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.349
You notice anything about this hatch?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.393
There's no handle.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.770
Could the reason
for that be more obvious?

14:58.273 --> 15:01.233
Maybe it was never meant
to be opened from the outside.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.997
Yeah! Over here!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.295
It's Michael.
Something's wrong.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.552
What'd you eat today?

15:30.847 --> 15:33.765
Fruit, fish.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.893
Drinking enough water?

15:36.978 --> 15:38.228
Two, three bottles.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.272
Where are you getting that water from?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.107
The caves, like everybody else.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.775
All right, listen, Michael.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.111
You just take it easy.
You stay in the shade.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.821
You try not to move too much.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.783
We have to launch that raft tomorrow.
We have to.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.702
I know. I need you to lay back.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.461
Lay down.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.671
Just lay down. OK?

16:09.886 --> 16:12.554
Hello? Hey, Adam. Hey, listen,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.848
can you carve out some time
for me on the MRI?

16:15.725 --> 16:19.019
Yeah, it's... it's a favor
for a friend of a friend.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.772
Oh, no, that'll work out great.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.565
OK. Yeah, thanks, Adam.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.571
His name's Connor.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.698
How old is he?

16:31.783 --> 16:34.076
Twenty-two months next week.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.163
He's beautiful.

16:38.247 --> 16:42.250
Yeah, well, that's Rachel,
that's not me.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.546
Where is she?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.466
She's over in Cedar Rapids
visiting her folks.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.259
They get back on Sunday.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.306
I got Diane in for an MRI.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.684
They'll bring her
downstairs to radiology.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.520
And her appointment's not until 5 am,

17:01.604 --> 17:04.146
so we've got about three hours to kill.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.109
- Tom...
- You're welcome.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.661
You think it's still there?

17:18.746 --> 17:19.746
What?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.457
You know what.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.586
It's the middle of the night, Katie.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.257
We might not get another chance.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.543
One, two, three,

18:06.627 --> 18:09.963
four, five, six.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.642
What do you think it is?
Heatstroke?

18:23.644 --> 18:26.188
No. He would've felt that coming on.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.690
Bad fruit, maybe? Raw fish?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.109
Michael and Jin are on the same diet.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.820
- And Jin's fine.
- Jin's fine.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.534
Whatever's making him sick
was metabolized fast.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.369
It hit him quick, it hit him hard.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.580
So you think it was the water?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.542
No, I don't think it was the water.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.171
I think it was something in the water.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.972
Feeling any better?

19:01.057 --> 19:03.350
Cramps are quieting down.

19:04.227 --> 19:08.438
As long as I don't move,
or... or breathe.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.739
You and Locke kiss and make up?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.284
Good.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.455
No, Michael.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.915
What?

19:30.253 --> 19:31.795
Drink from that one.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.007
- Somebody did this to me?
- I don't know.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.885
I'm not sure of anything yet.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.430
Sawyer.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.644
I'm on bamboo duty,
but sometimes I help refill the water.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.437
Michael and Jin getting along?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.649
They fight like a married couple
building a raft together.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.359
You told him?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.945
He thinks Sawyer might've done it.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.405
Oh, 'cause of Kate?

19:59.323 --> 20:02.117
- Kate?
- Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.369
So Sawyer went off on Michael because

20:04.453 --> 20:07.372
he gets to decide who goes.
You don't think Kate did it?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.166
Why would Kate poison Michael?

20:10.251 --> 20:13.420
Well, you know,
the whole fugitive thing.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.929
He doesn't know?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.392
How am I supposed to keep straight
who knows what?

20:27.476 --> 20:30.478
- Steve didn't know about the polar bear.
- What did she do?

20:31.939 --> 20:34.566
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?

20:34.650 --> 20:37.319
You didn't think the others
should know about this?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.238
Discretion, John.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.251
OK, can you stop moving
or I'm gonna cut your ear off.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.920
This is good.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.379
I'm writing again.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.798
I'm really feeling it, as well.

20:58.883 --> 21:02.177
So, what's the first thing
you're gonna do

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
when we get rescued?

21:05.681 --> 21:08.934
You know, I don't really know.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.519
You can hang out with me in LA.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.189
You and Turnip-Head. You know,

21:14.273 --> 21:15.899
until you figure things out.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.778
- Thanks.
- Smashing.

21:19.862 --> 21:24.199
OK. Check this out.
This is track two. It's called...

21:24.867 --> 21:25.867
Sorry.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.036
It's called Monster Eats The Pilot.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.008
How's Michael?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.178
He's gonna be fine.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.308
Is somebody gonna be taking
his place on the raft?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.479
I don't know.

21:54.563 --> 21:59.234
- Dr. Arzt said if they don't leave...
- Did you poison Michael, Kate?

22:00.277 --> 22:04.030
- What?
- He's not sick. Someone did this.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.250
Do you really think I'm capable of that?

22:18.713 --> 22:20.714
I don't know what you're capable of.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.857
You brought beer?

22:38.941 --> 22:42.027
No self-respecting man in Iowa
goes anywhere without beer.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.328
It's not fair, you know,

22:53.039 --> 22:54.956
you coming back.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.834
Here. Home.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.799
Yeah, I know.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.009
Wow.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.845
- Wow! Look at this stuff.
- Oh, my God!

23:52.014 --> 23:53.890
My plane.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.355
I can't believe I let you talk me
into putting this in there.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.065
That was your idea.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.325
Kate and Tom.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.994
1989.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.958
Is it on?

24:20.042 --> 24:22.168
- I don't think it's on.
- It's on.

24:23.546 --> 24:27.173
OK, this is Kate Austen
and Tom Brennan.

24:27.258 --> 24:31.177
And this is our dedication
for our time capsule

24:31.262 --> 24:34.139
here on August 15th, 1989.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.807
Hey, give me that back!

24:35.891 --> 24:38.351
Why are you putting this
stupid plane in there?

24:38.435 --> 24:41.729
Because it's cool, Katie. I got it
when I flew to Dallas by myself.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.858
That is cool!
Just like this time capsule.

24:44.942 --> 24:48.611
It'll be totally cool when we
dig it up in, like, 20 years.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.405
How do you know we'll be together?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.781
'Cause we'll be married.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.117
And you'll be a mom
and we'll have nine kids.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.910
I don't think so.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.495
As soon as I get my license,

24:57.580 --> 25:00.874
we should just get in a car and drive.
Like, you know, run away.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.834
You always wanna run away, Katie.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.130
Yeah. And you know why.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.009
Funny how things turn out.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.306
Yeah.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.724
Sorry.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.689
Yeah, we better get to the hospital.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.234
Yeah.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.129
What happened?

26:31.507 --> 26:32.924
I had a little accident.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.677
- Does it hurt?
- Yep.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.558
Something you wanna tell me, Walt?

26:44.603 --> 26:45.853
I didn't do it.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.273
Didn't do what?

26:49.191 --> 26:50.858
I heard Jack.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.945
He thinks somebody got my dad sick.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.989
And I didn't do it.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.492
You think because I know
you burned the first raft

26:59.576 --> 27:01.411
I'd think you made your dad sick?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.583
We're friends, aren't we Walt?

27:07.668 --> 27:10.128
I didn't tell on you before,
and I'm not gonna now.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.715
And I know you would never
do anything to hurt your dad.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.680
- What's the matter?
- Don't open it.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.933
- What did you say?
- Don't open it, Mr. Locke.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.435
Don't open that thing.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.812
What? What thing? What are you...?

27:27.896 --> 27:29.731
Just don't open it!

27:36.572 --> 27:38.573
Thought you might need that, boss.

27:39.241 --> 27:42.618
Wouldn't want our pilot out of
commission before takeoff.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.663
What? You feeling guilty?

27:46.248 --> 27:47.874
What?

27:49.084 --> 27:50.835
You're off the raft.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.337
Come again?

27:52.421 --> 27:55.757
You're off the raft.

27:55.841 --> 27:56.924
We had a deal.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.011
Well, the deal ended
the minute you decided to poison me.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.681
- I did what now?
- I'm done with you.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.184
You ain't done with me
by a damn sight.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.602
You said you needed four.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.936
I got four.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.441
You've been stealing stuff off of
dead bodies, keeping it for yourself,

28:13.525 --> 28:17.028
using it to buy favors.
You're a liar and a criminal!

28:17.112 --> 28:18.780
I'm not letting you near my boy!

28:18.864 --> 28:22.367
Oh, I'm a criminal?
I poisoned you 'cause I'm a criminal?

28:23.118 --> 28:25.620
Get your hands off me, boy.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.582
Hey, sweet cheeks!

28:31.794 --> 28:34.921
I had no idea how bad
you wanted off this rock.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.589
Time to set things straight.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.050
- Let go of me.
- Tell him who the criminal is.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.135
- Leave her alone, man.
- Tell him.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.808
- Give that back!
- Leave her alone.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.143
- "Leave her alone."
- Give that back.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.607
Look!

28:56.318 --> 28:57.819
Look at this.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.405
Sawyer, please.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.659
You all remember Joanna, don't you?

29:06.662 --> 29:08.913
The woman who drowned?

29:08.997 --> 29:11.916
Now what's Kate doing
with poor Joanna's ID?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.420
Could it be she'd do just about
anything to get on that raft,

29:15.504 --> 29:17.880
so she could get herself rescued?

29:17.965 --> 29:21.259
Run off with a new identity
before half the reporters in the world

29:21.343 --> 29:22.927
descend on this damn island?

29:23.011 --> 29:26.139
- She might poison the captain himself.
- Shut up.

29:31.311 --> 29:35.481
She don't care about
nothing or nobody but herself.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.994
This is good here. Thank you.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.382
My office is right back there.
I'll wait for you.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.414
Hi, Mom.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.296
Can you hear me?

30:41.715 --> 30:52.850
Mom?

31:03.487 --> 31:04.695
It's me, Katie.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.038
Katherine?

31:14.122 --> 31:17.208
It's me... Katherine.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.847
I'm so sorry for everything
that I have put you through.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.487
Help. Help.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.489
It's OK, Mom. It's just me.

31:48.991 --> 31:52.243
Help! Help!

31:52.327 --> 31:54.120
It's OK.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.997
- Help!
- Mom.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.041
Help. Help me!

31:59.126 --> 32:02.295
Help me! Somebody!

32:02.379 --> 32:06.841
Help me! Help me!

32:06.925 --> 32:08.509
Somebody!

32:09.803 --> 32:10.761
Help me!

32:10.846 --> 32:11.929
What's going on?

32:12.014 --> 32:15.141
I'm her daughter. She's confused.
I was getting a doctor.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.892
Hang on.
We got a situation...

32:21.690 --> 32:24.984
- What happened?
- I need your car keys.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.320
Kate? Katie?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.645
- Get out.
- I am not letting you do this.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.565
- You cooperate, they'll go easy.
- He's calling back-up. Get out!

33:04.650 --> 33:06.609
- You can have a real life.
- Please.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.777
- No.
- Now!

33:08.737 --> 33:10.321
- Get out!
- No!

33:37.599 --> 33:44.522
Tom?

33:44.648 --> 33:45.856
Oh, God. Tom!

33:45.941 --> 33:50.611
No, no, no, no! Tom!
Come on, please wake up.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.797
You wanna tell us why
you need to run so bad?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.632
Wanna tell us the truth?

34:23.812 --> 34:27.940
Yes. I was on the plane...

34:30.860 --> 34:32.402
...with the Marshal.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.949
Yes, I was wanted...

34:38.159 --> 34:39.909
...and caught

34:39.995 --> 34:42.538
and being transported back.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.667
No matter what I say
about what happened,

34:46.752 --> 34:48.502
about what I supposedly did...

34:51.172 --> 34:53.174
...I'm going to jail.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.181
But I didn't poison you.

35:08.690 --> 35:09.815
Here.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.652
- There you go.
- Good.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.047
He looks determined.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.800
Yes. He is.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.389
You don't want him to go, do you?

36:25.934 --> 36:27.142
No.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.437
Is that why you tried to make him sick?

36:34.109 --> 36:36.694
Michael and Jin working together
all the time,

36:36.778 --> 36:39.947
pretty easy for them to get
their water bottles mixed up.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.959
I didn't want him to die out there.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.801
I just didn't know what to do.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.057
I only used enough to make him...

37:08.602 --> 37:11.145
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.779
Are you gonna tell the others?

37:22.282 --> 37:24.783
I don't see any reason
why they need to know.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.494
But Sun...

37:28.997 --> 37:30.664
...he's going.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.666
If I were you, I'd...

37:35.170 --> 37:36.587
I'd say goodbye.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.418
I'm back on the raft.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.924
Glad to hear it.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.303
Michael's gonna cowboy up.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.472
We set sail tomorrow.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.935
Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?

38:35.981 --> 38:38.273
Sorry don't suit me.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.487
You cornered me, Freckles.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.948
- I did what I had to.
- I cornered you?

38:46.032 --> 38:49.201
You said if you wanted my spot,
you were gonna take it.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.120
Guess I believed you.

38:57.794 --> 39:02.423
Well... that's that.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.512
I got some packing to do.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.977
Why is it so important for you
to be on that raft?

39:26.114 --> 39:29.616
'Cause there ain't anything
on this island worth staying for.

39:44.758 --> 39:46.633
Be safe, Sawyer.

39:50.597 --> 39:51.638
Yeah.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.406
- Dad?
- Hey, buddy!

40:09.991 --> 40:11.075
You getting better?

40:11.159 --> 40:14.870
Yeah. Yep, I'm gonna be all right.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.417
Hey. Don't worry.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.628
I'm gonna be on my feet soon

40:22.712 --> 40:25.339
and we'll be sailing home
before you can even...

40:25.423 --> 40:27.341
I'm the one that burned the raft.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.477
I didn't wanna leave,
and I thought I could stop you.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.524
I'm sorry.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.527
I'm really sorry, Dad.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.033
Hey, it's OK, man.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.871
We can stay here.

40:59.374 --> 41:03.710
You and me.
We don't have to go.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.174
Yes, we do.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.980
Hello.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.898
Hey!

41:32.532 --> 41:34.158
Jack knows.

41:37.871 --> 41:40.706
I didn't tell him it was your idea.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.086
Thanks.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.173
Why should you be punished?

41:49.257 --> 41:51.216
You were only trying to help me.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.930
He said he wouldn't tell the others.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.392
Yeah.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.704

42:30.840 --> 42:32.841
Me too.
