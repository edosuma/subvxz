00:02.517 --> 00:04.317
You remember
Toby's stepsister?

00:04.352 --> 00:06.086
She's the
admissions counselor.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.288
She told
our school counselor that
I tried to sleep with her

00:08.322 --> 00:10.323
and that's why
she wasn't going to
let me go to school there.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.392
I know that
Adrian told you that
we're living together.

00:12.427 --> 00:14.394
I think you definitely
shouldn't act like a husband.

00:14.429 --> 00:16.062
I have my own
room now.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.264
You told him
not to have sex with me.

00:17.298 --> 00:19.199
Okay. But I did
not tell him why.

00:19.233 --> 00:22.069
I'm going to do
whatever I have to do
to get a college degree.

00:22.103 --> 00:23.203
I just want to help you.

00:23.237 --> 00:28.108
I'm not ready for a wife
or two children. Are you?

00:28.142 --> 00:29.309
I just might be.

00:29.343 --> 00:30.477
He still didn't
say anything?

00:30.511 --> 00:32.212
Who?
Milton.

00:32.246 --> 00:34.181
You're not really gonna
drink that, are you?

00:34.215 --> 00:36.249
If it teaches you
a lesson, yes.

00:38.186 --> 00:39.519
You didn't say anything
about your date last night.

00:39.554 --> 00:42.255
I had a 9:00 curfew
like a big baby.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.157
I screwed up.
I had a drink.

00:44.192 --> 00:46.326
From the looks of things,
I'd say it was more
than a drink.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.395
I had almost two years
without a drink.

00:48.429 --> 00:51.164
I'll have someone drive you
to a meeting and then
they'll drive you home.

00:51.199 --> 00:53.500
You're officially
accepted. Congratulations.

00:53.534 --> 00:56.269
It's not very often
that something good
happens to me.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.113 --> 01:07.080
Oh. Here,
let me help you
with that.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.283
(SIGHS)
He stayed over?

01:10.318 --> 01:12.052
It's none of
your business.

01:12.086 --> 01:13.386
All right, but I want to
ask you about something
later.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.122
Just ask me now.

01:15.156 --> 01:17.124
I don't think now
is the right time.

01:18.059 --> 01:19.326
Good morning.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.328
Good morning.

01:21.362 --> 01:24.097
I'll be right there,
Jack just wanted to
ask me something.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.199
All right.
Go ahead.

01:26.234 --> 01:27.334
She said
she'd be right there.

01:27.368 --> 01:29.469
I heard.

01:29.504 --> 01:32.105
Jack, just ask me
what you wanted
to ask me.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.274
Okay. But, now,
it's a waste of time.

01:34.308 --> 01:36.476
Are you doing anything
next Saturday night?

01:38.079 --> 01:39.279
Yeah.

01:39.313 --> 01:41.148
Were you just going to
ask Grace out

01:41.182 --> 01:42.349
while I'm standing
right here
in front of you?

01:42.383 --> 01:43.450
We're friends, right?

01:43.484 --> 01:45.318
Not really, no.

01:45.353 --> 01:46.520
I think that's
you and Grant.

01:46.554 --> 01:49.156
I need someone to go
to the senior dance with.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.424
I broke up with Madison,
and I wouldn't go,

01:51.459 --> 01:54.528
but Coach says that
all the athletes
must attend, so...

01:54.562 --> 01:56.129
I must attend.

01:56.164 --> 01:58.064
And you thought
I'd attend with you.

01:58.099 --> 02:00.167
Yeah. Or maybe
fix me up
with someone.

02:02.403 --> 02:04.070
I'll think about it.

02:04.105 --> 02:06.072
About fixing you up
with someone.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.041
See ya.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.182
Really?
You're going to
fix him up?

02:15.216 --> 02:18.318
I don't know,
that's why I said
I'd think about it.

02:18.352 --> 02:20.353
Right now,
all I can think about
is you.

02:24.425 --> 02:26.293
We can't.

02:26.327 --> 02:28.495
I wouldn't be comfortable
doing anything here.

02:28.529 --> 02:30.463
Let's stay over
at my place tonight.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.299
Okay.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.400
Okay.

02:39.373 --> 02:40.507
(CHUCKLES)

02:46.047 --> 02:48.148
Hey, good morning.

02:48.182 --> 02:49.182
Good morning.

02:49.217 --> 02:50.317
How'd you sleep?

02:50.351 --> 02:52.052
I slept well,
thank you.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.089
I slept well as well,
thank you.

02:56.324 --> 02:57.324
(CHUCKLES)

02:58.326 --> 02:59.459
We are friends, right?

02:59.493 --> 03:01.995
Yes, ware friends.

03:02.964 --> 03:04.097
How'd you sleep?

03:05.233 --> 03:07.100
I slept well as well.

03:07.134 --> 03:09.269
Oh, right,
you just said that.

03:10.972 --> 03:12.372
How are you, Adrian?

03:12.406 --> 03:14.241
I'm okay.

03:14.275 --> 03:17.110
I feel better
since I've started walking,
and since we made a plan.

03:17.144 --> 03:19.279
I feel more settled.

03:19.313 --> 03:22.182
And I'm excited about
graduating this summer.

03:22.216 --> 03:24.117
That's good,
I'm excited for you.

03:24.151 --> 03:26.186
Yeah, and you're
excited for you

03:26.220 --> 03:28.154
because then
you can get out
of this place,

03:29.457 --> 03:32.259
and this marriage.

03:32.293 --> 03:37.097
It's a little early in the day
to talk about
something so serious.

03:37.131 --> 03:39.332
Have some popcorn.
Watch cartoons.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.467
We're young.
It's the weekend.

03:41.369 --> 03:43.270
Yeah. It is.

03:45.273 --> 03:47.040
Okay, what?

03:47.074 --> 03:49.209
What?
You've got
something on your mind.

03:50.344 --> 03:55.215
Okay.
I just need
one little favor.

03:55.249 --> 03:57.150
What is it?

03:57.184 --> 03:58.451
Could we please just
go to the senior dance
together?

03:58.486 --> 04:01.121
I really want to go.
Please?

04:03.391 --> 04:05.091
I guess, okay.

04:05.126 --> 04:06.159
Really?

04:06.193 --> 04:07.227
Why not?

04:07.261 --> 04:09.029
From now until August
we're married,

04:09.063 --> 04:11.331
so, if you want to go
to the dance,
let's go to the dance.

04:11.365 --> 04:14.000
It's not that big a deal.

04:14.035 --> 04:15.168
Thank you.

04:15.202 --> 04:17.202
You're welcome.

04:17.238 --> 04:19.072
Oh, I love this one.
(LAUGHS)

04:26.414 --> 04:29.015
I've got to go to work.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.383
(EXHALES) Sorry.

04:30.418 --> 04:32.952
That's okay.
It's good to have
work to go to.

04:32.987 --> 04:36.189
Before you go,
did you want to
ask me anything?

04:37.058 --> 04:38.091
I don't think so.

04:39.193 --> 04:40.393
The senior dance
is next weekend.

04:41.996 --> 04:43.029
So?

04:43.064 --> 04:44.230
So you don't want to go?

04:44.265 --> 04:46.099
No, I don't want to go.

04:50.371 --> 04:51.471
See you later.

04:57.311 --> 04:58.978
I want to go.

Maybe they are.

05:24.886 --> 05:27.587
Maybe she just needs
the extra cash.

05:27.622 --> 05:29.756
Maybe you don't have
any idea.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.625
Ask Ben.
Where's Ben?

05:31.659 --> 05:33.627
Oh, he's coming,
but not until later.

05:33.661 --> 05:36.530
I don't really need
three of you here to open.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.601
I knew it.
Something happened.

05:41.636 --> 05:43.770
Whatever it was,
to do with me,e anything

05:43.805 --> 05:45.505
so I'm staying out of it.

05:47.709 --> 05:49.810
Good morning, Bunny.
Good morning.

Whw's the cute little boy
you got with you?

We're just going to go
and do some laundry.se

05:57.552 --> 05:59.553
I could help you
off work.ited until I'm

05:59.587 --> 06:01.421
That's okay,
you help me all the time.

06:01.456 --> 06:03.390
You do everything,
and you're working.

06:03.424 --> 06:04.758
Let me do something.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.860
Have a nice day.

06:10.465 --> 06:11.798
I wish you helped me
that much.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.533
I don't help her
that much.

06:13.568 --> 06:15.836
She just wants to go
and I don't want to go.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.671
I know what that's about.

06:17.705 --> 06:19.473
(LOUDLY) Because that's
how much it costs!

06:19.507 --> 06:22.843
Uh-huh? Then forget it.
I'll go to the supermarket!

06:22.877 --> 06:24.811
Go. Go to
the supermarket.

06:24.846 --> 06:28.715
You can't get anything
the damn supermarket!

06:30.651 --> 06:32.619
Here you go.
On the house.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.654
Thank you. I will.

06:37.525 --> 06:38.759
Ugh!

06:38.793 --> 06:41.862
Go ahead. Fire me.
work here either.o

06:46.868 --> 06:48.602
Did Leo fire you?

06:48.636 --> 06:49.770
I quit.

06:49.804 --> 06:51.438
What happened?

06:51.472 --> 06:53.607
Nothing happened.
It's just not the job
for me, okay?

06:53.641 --> 06:56.476
And maybe this isn't
the job for me either.

06:56.511 --> 06:59.513
Bunny, could I have
with Nora?utside

06:59.547 --> 07:01.448
Oh, so now it's Nora, huh?

Yeah.

07:17.398 --> 07:18.465
Okay.

07:19.801 --> 07:22.569
I take it you
fell off the wagon?

07:22.603 --> 07:23.804
Did you expect
that I wouldn't?

07:23.838 --> 07:26.506
I hoped
that you wouldn't.

07:26.541 --> 07:28.375
I try not to have
any expectations

07:28.409 --> 07:30.444
so I don't have
any disappointments.

07:30.845 --> 07:32.646
Are you okay?

07:32.680 --> 07:34.414
What do you care?

07:34.449 --> 07:35.515
You're my mother.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.850
You haven't always
been a mother to me,

07:36.884 --> 07:39.686
but you're my mother,
and I care.

07:40.888 --> 07:42.589
Did this just happen
last night?

07:42.623 --> 07:44.424
You get drunk?
You got high?

07:44.459 --> 07:46.693
Hmm.
I got drunk. last.

07:47.595 --> 07:49.496
Night before last?

07:49.530 --> 07:51.598
Night before last
with Ben.out to dinner

07:51.632 --> 07:54.401
No, it wasn't his fault.
Exactly.

07:54.435 --> 07:55.836
Was he with you
when you got drunk?

07:55.870 --> 07:58.705
Yeah.
And when I passed out.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.807
He took me over
to his dad's house

08:00.842 --> 08:02.576
and left me in
his old bedroom

08:02.610 --> 08:05.512
with a note
pinned on my shirt.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.380
And then,
Leo fired you?

08:07.415 --> 08:09.516
No, not right away.

08:09.550 --> 08:12.352
He had his driver
drive me to a meeting,

08:12.386 --> 08:13.653
and then he told the driver
to drive me back home,

08:13.688 --> 08:16.656
not to bring me
into the office.

08:16.691 --> 08:19.326
I went to the office
anyway,

08:19.360 --> 08:24.431
and he told me
he thought it would be best
if I just came back here.

08:24.465 --> 08:28.301
All right, well,
you just start over.

08:28.336 --> 08:30.537
You just take it
one day at a time.

08:31.506 --> 08:33.340
Yeah.

08:33.374 --> 08:35.509
I don't think that's
really working for me.

08:35.543 --> 08:36.676
I'm going to try
something else.

08:36.711 --> 08:38.511
No, that program
was working for you.

08:38.546 --> 08:40.347
You just have to
work the program.

08:40.381 --> 08:41.681
You've tried
everything else.

08:43.384 --> 08:44.751
You don't know
anything about it.

08:48.723 --> 08:50.457
Wait.

08:50.491 --> 08:51.658
End of discussion.

08:51.692 --> 08:53.593
You can't tell me
what to do.

08:53.628 --> 08:55.762
Just because you have a son
doesn't mean you
can tell me what to do.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.697
You don't know
anything about it.

08:57.732 --> 08:59.733
You said that.
And you're right.

08:59.767 --> 09:03.637
And this isn't
about me anyway,
this is about you.

09:03.671 --> 09:05.605
You live your life,
I'll live my life.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.708
Only, this is
your last chance to
be involved in my life.

09:08.743 --> 09:10.310
I swear.

09:13.714 --> 09:15.315
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:17.418 --> 09:19.452
Ben, someone's
at the door.

09:20.788 --> 09:22.756
No! Don't answer it.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.324
Why not?

09:25.393 --> 09:26.426
Hi, Mr. Boykewich.

09:26.460 --> 09:27.661
Hi, there.
Good morning.

09:27.695 --> 09:29.496
Good morning,
come on in.

09:34.435 --> 09:36.369
Morning, Ben.

09:36.404 --> 09:38.672
I was wondering if I
may speak with you.

09:38.706 --> 09:41.374
Could I get you
a cup of coffee
or something?

09:41.409 --> 09:42.676
No, thank you, Adrian.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.511
Do you mind if I
talk to Ben alone?

09:44.545 --> 09:45.645
No, I don't mind.

09:51.819 --> 09:53.520
I should have
called you.

09:53.554 --> 09:55.522
Yeah, you should have.

09:58.759 --> 10:01.461
I didn't drink.
I swear I didn't.

10:01.495 --> 10:03.430
She's an alcoholic, Ben.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.398
She'd been sober
for almost two years,

10:05.433 --> 10:07.701
and she fell off the wagon
when she was with you.

10:07.735 --> 10:09.703
What happened?
Well...

10:09.737 --> 10:11.605
I'm not quite sure.

10:11.639 --> 10:14.341
She was lecturing me
on the dangers of alcohol,

10:14.375 --> 10:16.509
and then her
old girlfriend showed up
with Ruben.

10:16.544 --> 10:20.447
They were at the bar,
and then she came over
to talk to Nora, and then...

10:21.382 --> 10:22.582
I don't know.

10:22.617 --> 10:23.750
A waiter got an order
mixed up

10:23.784 --> 10:25.819
and brought over
a bottle of wine
to the table,

10:25.853 --> 10:28.488
and the next thing I know,
she's drunk.

10:28.522 --> 10:29.723
And pretty belligerent.

10:29.757 --> 10:31.424
Why didn't you
take her to her house?

10:31.459 --> 10:33.526
Because she lives
with Ricky's mother.

10:33.561 --> 10:35.462
Ricky's other mother.

10:35.496 --> 10:37.697
I forget which one
is the other mother and
which one's the mother.

10:37.732 --> 10:40.767
Anyway, she refused to
give me the address,

10:40.801 --> 10:42.836
and I didn't want to
call Ricky,

10:42.870 --> 10:44.771
so, I just dumped her off
where I thought she'd be safe.

10:46.507 --> 10:47.841
I had to let her go
from the office.

10:48.609 --> 10:49.676
Had to?

10:49.710 --> 10:51.678
Too much information
in that office

10:51.712 --> 10:54.681
about me and my business,
and you even.

10:54.715 --> 10:56.683
I can't have someone
getting drunk and

10:56.717 --> 10:58.618
going around
talking to people

10:58.653 --> 11:00.787
and saying
something stupid.

11:00.821 --> 11:03.723
I told her
she could go back
to the butcher shop.

11:03.758 --> 11:06.326
Is she going to be back
at the butcher shop today,

11:06.360 --> 11:07.460
when I'm at
the butcher shop,

11:07.495 --> 11:10.397
and Ricky's at
the butcher shop?

11:10.431 --> 11:12.365
Maybe you should
reconsider.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.566
I mean, she's in AA.

11:13.601 --> 11:15.669
I'm sure she'll just
quit drinking again.

11:15.703 --> 11:17.604
We talked about this.

11:17.638 --> 11:20.473
It's not that easy
to just quit drinking.

11:20.508 --> 11:22.809
Some people can't
just quit drinking.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.611
And I'm afraid that
if you start drinking,

11:24.645 --> 11:26.446
you could be
one of those people.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.648
I'm not,
but you could be.

11:28.683 --> 11:31.651
Dad, I'm probably
going to have a drink
once in a while.

11:31.686 --> 11:34.554
I'll be responsible
when I drink,
and not drink too much,

11:34.588 --> 11:37.590
and I won't drive
when I've had a drink.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.492
But I'm probably
going to drink.

11:39.527 --> 11:42.462
I told you,
I don't think
you should.

11:44.632 --> 11:46.566
Oh, geez.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.769
I wish you'd just do
what I tell you to do,
you know that?

11:49.804 --> 11:51.471
If you'd just do
what I tell you,

11:51.505 --> 11:53.840
I wouldn't have to
do this.
I don't want to do this.

11:53.874 --> 11:55.608
You don't want to
do what?

11:56.444 --> 11:58.378
Ruin your memories.

11:58.412 --> 12:01.381
Change the image
that you've always had
of your mother.

12:01.415 --> 12:03.483
What?

12:03.517 --> 12:05.719
Your mother was
a lovely, lovely woman.

12:05.753 --> 12:09.322
She was sweet,
she was funny.

12:09.357 --> 12:10.790
She was a good wife
and a good mother.

12:10.825 --> 12:14.627
And she was
an alcoholic.

12:14.662 --> 12:16.730
And so was
her mother and
her father.

12:16.764 --> 12:20.734
They died in a car accident
before you were born,
caused by her father.

12:21.836 --> 12:24.471
They were coming home
from a party drunk.

12:24.505 --> 12:26.406
I know you knew about
the car accident,

12:26.440 --> 12:27.607
but I never told you
the other stuff

12:27.641 --> 12:30.310
because I didn't
want you to think
of them ke that.

12:30.344 --> 12:33.580
Anyway, your mom
quit drinking
after the accident,

12:33.614 --> 12:37.317
but she always
struggled with it,
Ben, she always did.

12:37.351 --> 12:40.353
So, I don't want you
to have a drink.

12:40.388 --> 12:41.688
At all.

12:41.722 --> 12:44.691
And I'm sorry to
have to tell you why.

12:45.793 --> 12:47.394
Me, too.

12:49.310 --> 12:49.310
+

12:54.068 --> 12:56.102
Why is he coming
over to meet us?

12:55.315 --> 12:57.316
Because he wants to.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.617
I've met him,
he's really nice.

12:59.452 --> 13:01.420
Don't lie to them.

13:01.454 --> 13:05.391
He's not always nice,
and you probably
won't like him

13:05.425 --> 13:07.293
until you get to
know him.

13:07.327 --> 13:10.596
Tom, don't make them
hate the guy
before he even gets here.

13:10.630 --> 13:12.231
It's really no big deal.

13:12.265 --> 13:14.333
I met Milton
and I thought you
might like him.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.534
He's a little gruff,

13:15.569 --> 13:18.470
like the Grinch who
stole Christmas,

13:18.505 --> 13:20.306
before he got his heart.

13:20.340 --> 13:24.476
But he has a heart,
he has a very big heart,
and he's funny.

13:24.511 --> 13:25.544
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:25.579 --> 13:26.745
I got it.

13:29.382 --> 13:30.416
Here he is.

13:30.450 --> 13:32.251
Good morning!

13:32.285 --> 13:33.552
(SCREAMING)

13:36.289 --> 13:39.391
They're afraid of clowns.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.460
Okay.
Obviously a bad choice.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.335
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)

13:49.369 --> 13:50.502
(MOCK SCREAMS)

13:50.537 --> 13:52.504
God! I think I just
lost my voice.

13:52.539 --> 13:54.440
What are you doing here
like that?

13:57.577 --> 13:59.578
Your dad didn't tell me
that you were
going to be here.

13:59.613 --> 14:01.347
My dad didn't tell me
you were going to
be here.

14:01.381 --> 14:02.581
What are you
doing here?

14:02.616 --> 14:05.584
Oh, geez,
this is really
embarrassing.

14:05.619 --> 14:07.553
Uh, I'll be right back.

14:14.594 --> 14:17.529
Dad, it's me,
I'm at the house and
Ruben is over here.

14:17.564 --> 14:19.598
I was doing laundry
and he just...

14:20.400 --> 14:22.701
Okay, well...

14:22.736 --> 14:27.473
We were just having
a little problem last night
over at our house and, uh...

14:27.507 --> 14:33.679
Well, I called your dad
and he said that I could
use this house.

14:33.713 --> 14:34.713
What kind of problem?

14:34.748 --> 14:38.317
Uh, well, uh...

14:38.351 --> 14:39.485
A house problem.

14:39.519 --> 14:42.321
What kind of house problem?

14:42.355 --> 14:43.722
I got locked out.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.624
Well, I think we have
your extra key over here.

14:45.659 --> 14:49.595
The door was
bolted from the inside
by Cindy.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.697
My wife.
Adrian's mother.

14:51.731 --> 14:53.399
I know who she is.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.267
I'll just be going now.

14:55.735 --> 14:57.436
Okay.
Uh.

14:58.238 --> 14:59.405
I might be back.

14:59.439 --> 15:01.607
I hope not.
I mean, I hope
everything is okay.

15:01.641 --> 15:02.675
Yeah.

15:04.411 --> 15:08.280
Hey, do you mind if I
just have
a cup of coffee first?

15:10.383 --> 15:12.451
All right.
You want me to make it
for you?

15:12.485 --> 15:14.586
No, no, that's okay.
I can do that.

15:17.223 --> 15:18.390
You know where
everything is?

15:18.425 --> 15:20.192
Oh, yeah. It's...

15:20.226 --> 15:21.460
Not your first
morning here.

15:23.563 --> 15:27.232
But everything's
going to be fine.
We're just...

15:27.667 --> 15:29.435
We've just...

15:29.469 --> 15:31.537
Look, I know how much
stress you must be under

15:31.571 --> 15:34.273
with everything
that's happened.

15:34.307 --> 15:36.241
And I hope
you can work it out.

15:37.377 --> 15:38.610
Thanks, Amy.

15:38.645 --> 15:41.613
I think I'll go
have coffee at my house.

15:44.317 --> 15:46.618
Okay, well,

15:46.653 --> 15:49.555
I should be out of here
in another hour or so.

15:49.589 --> 15:51.657
Parents have problems.

15:51.691 --> 15:54.359
They're just people,
you know?

15:54.394 --> 15:57.429
It's not a reflection
on the children.

15:57.464 --> 15:59.364
The problems
would happen regardless.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.545
Senior dance.
Oh, I can't wait.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.614
I wish I was
graduating in June.

16:15.648 --> 16:18.317
But if I can graduate
in August...

16:18.351 --> 16:19.418
Good morning.

16:19.452 --> 16:21.553
Uh. Good morning.

16:21.588 --> 16:24.590
I thought you were
at the office
working on that case.

16:26.493 --> 16:28.193
Morning, Dad.

16:28.228 --> 16:30.562
Hey, Adrian,
it's good to see you.

16:31.531 --> 16:33.432
What's going on?

16:33.466 --> 16:37.202
I just wanted to see
if I had anything that I could
wear to the senior dance.

16:37.237 --> 16:38.403
What's going on with you?

16:38.438 --> 16:40.205
Nothing.
Nothing.

16:42.275 --> 16:45.511
Okay, well, something.

16:49.249 --> 16:51.617
I saw Amy's car
in the driveway,

16:51.651 --> 16:55.387
so I think I'll just
go see Amy.

16:56.656 --> 16:58.257
Are you two okay?

16:59.526 --> 17:01.226
We're fine.
We're fine.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.162
(SIGHS) Bye.

17:07.133 --> 17:08.200
She looks good.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.334
Yeah, she does.

17:09.368 --> 17:12.436
She's not going to fit
into anything she has,

17:12.472 --> 17:16.141
but she looks a lot better
and she feeling a lot better.

17:16.175 --> 17:17.442
She's walking
every morning.

17:17.477 --> 17:20.479
Walking.
That's good.

17:21.513 --> 17:23.182
Hmm.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.384
(SIGHS)

17:26.519 --> 17:28.487
I'm sorry, Cindy.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.356
I'm really sorry.
About everything.

17:32.358 --> 17:33.492
Me, too.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.164
I love you.

17:39.199 --> 17:40.566
I love you, too.

17:43.169 --> 17:46.205
Mmm! I remember
your senior dance.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.406
Yeah. Me, too.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.574
(CHUCKLES)

17:49.509 --> 17:50.542
Oh.

17:52.278 --> 17:54.580
She's not going to
get pregnant
a second time.

17:56.416 --> 17:57.549
Not right now, anyway.

17:59.219 --> 18:01.253
You're not going
to the senior dance?

18:01.287 --> 18:03.355
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think so.

18:03.389 --> 18:06.225
I mean, we could,
but it's just so expensive.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.359
I mean,
I'd have to buy a dress,

18:07.393 --> 18:10.128
Ricky would have to
buy a suit, and...

18:10.163 --> 18:11.296
What's the point?
We live together.

18:11.331 --> 18:13.131
We can dance in
our living room.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.200
What's the point?

18:15.235 --> 18:17.536
The point is it's
a rite of passage.

18:17.570 --> 18:20.105
It's the senior dance.

18:20.139 --> 18:23.141
It's the kick off
to all the senior activities
that are coming up.

18:23.176 --> 18:27.379
Yeah, but, I don't think
Ricky's all that hooked
into all that senior stuff.

18:27.413 --> 18:30.182
I mean,
he's really focused
on college,

18:30.216 --> 18:32.517
so I don't think
he's making any of it
too important.

18:35.421 --> 18:37.189
He's so cute.

18:39.158 --> 18:41.360
I can't wait till Ben and I
have a baby.

18:42.528 --> 18:43.595
Someday.

18:48.346 --> 18:48.346
+

18:52.188 --> 18:53.222
Hi, Daniel.

18:53.256 --> 18:55.123
Hi. Good morning.

18:55.158 --> 18:58.293
Yeah, I guess
11:30 is
still morning.

18:58.328 --> 19:00.095
I was wondering
if we could ask you
something.

19:00.129 --> 19:01.230
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

19:01.264 --> 19:02.331
Oh. It's Amy.

19:02.365 --> 19:05.334
I better take this,
it might be important.

19:05.368 --> 19:08.303
Are you sure she's
mature enough for you
to go out with?

19:08.338 --> 19:10.973
You seem slightly more
mature than Grace.

19:11.007 --> 19:13.275
Which is why
I like you and trust you.

19:13.309 --> 19:16.211
Can she sleep over
at my place tonight?

19:16.246 --> 19:18.981
I would rather
she didn't.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.083
But that's up to
the two of you.

19:21.117 --> 19:22.251
Thank you.

19:22.285 --> 19:24.119
And just because she's
sleeping over,

19:24.153 --> 19:26.088
doesn't mean you have to
do anything.

19:28.191 --> 19:30.025
Okay.
Okay, what?

19:30.059 --> 19:32.060
Okay, I heard you,

19:32.095 --> 19:36.131
and I don't know that
we won't be doing anything,
to be honest.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.467
Think about it.

19:38.501 --> 19:40.035
I will.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.438
<i>AMY:
Grace, you have to
talk to her.</i>

19:43.473 --> 19:46.174
I saw this look in her eye
when she was holding John,

19:46.209 --> 19:48.277
and I'm telling you,
she's actually
thinking about it.

19:48.311 --> 19:49.444
I know it sounds crazy,
but...

19:49.479 --> 19:51.446
It does,
it sounds crazy.
(SCOFFS)

19:52.415 --> 19:54.149
Why do you sound funny?

19:54.183 --> 19:56.218
I sound funny 'cause
I have a frog in my throat,

19:56.252 --> 19:58.353
but, why do you
sound funny?
What do you know?

19:58.388 --> 20:00.455
I know nothing,
I told you,
I know nothing.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.491
Yes, you do.

20:02.525 --> 20:05.160
You don't think she's
actually trying to trick Ben
into getting her pregnant

20:05.194 --> 20:07.062
or something crazy
like that, do you?

20:07.096 --> 20:08.230
Something like that.

20:08.264 --> 20:10.132
But you have to promise
not t t to say anything.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.367
Grace! She told you
she's trying to get
pregnant again?

20:12.402 --> 20:13.468
Yeah.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.270
No. No, she's not
thinking straight.

20:15.305 --> 20:17.105
Talk to her.
She's still depressed
or something,

20:17.140 --> 20:18.540
and thinks this is
the way out.

20:18.574 --> 20:21.543
She can't do this
to herself, or to Ben,
or their families.

20:21.577 --> 20:23.211
And everyone's
still recovering.

20:23.246 --> 20:25.147
I know that.

20:25.181 --> 20:28.083
But you can't tell her tha
and I can't tell her that,
she won't hear any of it.

20:28.117 --> 20:30.085
The only person
we can talk to is Ben.

20:30.119 --> 20:31.253
One of us
should tell Ben.

20:32.221 --> 20:34.222
Well, that can't be me.

20:34.257 --> 20:38.360
I tried, and Adrian caught me,
and made me swear I wouldn't,
so, it can't be me either.

20:38.394 --> 20:41.363
Maybe Ricky would do it.
You should get Ricky to do it.

20:41.397 --> 20:44.099
Oh, and by the way,
Jack is looking for someone

20:44.133 --> 20:45.233
to go to
the senior dance with,

20:45.268 --> 20:47.202
so, if you or Ricky
know anyone.

20:47.236 --> 20:49.171
What does that have
to do with anything?

20:49.205 --> 20:50.472
I don't know.

20:50.506 --> 20:52.507
It's just something else
for you to talk to Ricky
about.

20:55.278 --> 20:58.246
Do you have any
makeup remover?

21:01.517 --> 21:03.118
Milton.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.355
You're not
what I pictured.

21:06.389 --> 21:08.357
It wasn't my idea.

21:19.102 --> 21:20.302
I'm sorry.

21:20.336 --> 21:22.404
It's not your fault.

21:22.438 --> 21:28.276
But you couldn't have
grabbed the bottle or
the glass or something?

21:28.311 --> 21:30.112
I didn't know
what to do.

21:31.547 --> 21:33.382
We're never
having dinner again.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.516
All right.

21:36.119 --> 21:38.120
Could I speak to you?

21:38.154 --> 21:40.122
Not today, okay?
Another day.

21:40.156 --> 21:42.424
Now.
You're not
in charge here.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.160
Drop it for right now,
Ricky, all right?

21:45.194 --> 21:46.595
Not right now.

21:49.365 --> 21:52.100
If you two want to
take a break...

21:52.135 --> 21:53.435
I just got here, but...

21:58.508 --> 22:00.308
Just talk to her.

22:00.343 --> 22:04.146
I can't help her.
I really can't help her.

22:04.180 --> 22:07.215
No, probably not,
but maybe she'll realize that
and go to a meeting.

22:09.385 --> 22:11.053
Could save her life.

22:28.237 --> 22:29.337
Hey.

22:29.372 --> 22:31.273
I'm going to talk to him
at some point, you know.

22:31.307 --> 22:34.042
Yeah, I know.
Look, the boss called.

22:34.077 --> 22:36.411
And he wants you to
fire her from here, too?

22:36.446 --> 22:39.081
I mean, she probably
shouldn't be around
sharp objects.

22:39.115 --> 22:40.515
Or cash.

22:40.550 --> 22:43.151
He wanted me to know
that Ben was having
a bad day.

22:43.186 --> 22:45.253
He talked to him about
going out with your mom,

22:45.288 --> 22:48.223
and to kind of emphasize
his concern about drinking.

22:48.257 --> 22:51.193
Not just her drinking,
but Ben's recent exploits.

22:51.227 --> 22:54.329
He told Ben something
he never knew before.

22:54.363 --> 22:57.399
Is it something that I
would give a crap about?

22:57.433 --> 22:59.468
His mother was
an alcoholic.

22:59.502 --> 23:04.272
So, maybe you two
have more in common
than anyone thought.

23:04.307 --> 23:05.507
A little help, please?

23:07.410 --> 23:08.443
Here. I got it.

23:09.312 --> 23:11.012
Hi, John.

23:11.047 --> 23:12.414
Good job
on the laundry.

23:15.118 --> 23:17.285
Yeah, yeah,
help the lady upstairs.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.121
Come on.

23:27.330 --> 23:31.266
Did you pass by
Ben and my mother, Nora,
on your way in?

23:31.300 --> 23:36.204
Yeah, I saw Ben.
But, I didn't stop
to talk to him.

23:36.239 --> 23:37.572
He didn't look like
he wanted to talk.

23:37.607 --> 23:40.142
He turned his back to me
as soon as he
saw us coming up, and...

23:40.176 --> 23:42.177
So she wasn't
out there, huh?

23:42.512 --> 23:44.246
She probably took off.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.082
Took off where?
Whwould she take off?

23:47.116 --> 23:48.416
She fell off the wagon.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.220
She's D-R-U-N-K?

23:52.255 --> 23:54.289
Not now,
she got D-R-U...

23:54.323 --> 23:56.291
Why are we spelling?
He doesn't know what
drunk is.

23:56.325 --> 23:58.293
I don't want him to know.
What happened?

23:58.327 --> 24:01.196
She went out with Ben
to give him a lecture
on not drinking,

24:01.230 --> 24:04.399
and somehow it
turned around on her,
and she slipped.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.236
Poor Nora.
She was doing so well.

24:08.271 --> 24:10.038
Longest she's done
that well.

24:10.072 --> 24:12.140
I guess I should have
been paying more attention.

24:12.175 --> 24:14.176
What am I saying?
It wasn't my fault.

24:14.210 --> 24:16.244
She's responsible
for her own problems.

24:16.279 --> 24:19.247
Wait. Did Ben
get drunk, too?

24:19.282 --> 24:24.119
Oh, geez, I really hope
he's not drinking and
getting drunk every night,

24:24.153 --> 24:26.321
otherwise he really is
going to get Adrian
pregnant again.

24:26.355 --> 24:27.989
Huh?

24:28.024 --> 24:30.125
You have to talk to him,
Ricky, you have to tell him.

24:30.159 --> 24:31.326
Tell him what?

24:31.360 --> 24:33.261
I think Adrian is
trying to get pregnant
again.

24:33.296 --> 24:34.429
What would make you
think that?

24:34.463 --> 24:36.331
Not that it's
any of our business.

24:36.365 --> 24:39.034
She stopped over
at my dad's house and
then she was holding John,

24:39.068 --> 24:40.435
and then just this
look in her eyes...

24:40.469 --> 24:43.438
Amy, please, tell me
you're not jumping
to some crazy conclusion

24:43.472 --> 24:45.273
based on a look
in Adrian's eyes?

24:45.308 --> 24:47.309
No, but that look
did make me want to
talk to Grace,

24:47.343 --> 24:48.443
so I called Grace...

24:48.477 --> 24:50.378
What is it
with you girls?

24:50.413 --> 24:53.014
We're girls.

24:53.049 --> 24:56.451
Anyways, Grace said that
Adrian told her...

24:56.485 --> 24:59.054
She told her that
she is trying to
get pregnant again.

24:59.088 --> 25:01.256
Oh. And she
wanted to know

25:01.290 --> 25:03.325
if you know anyone
that would go to
the senior dance with Jack.

25:03.359 --> 25:05.327
No. I don't.
And Adrian actually
said this?

25:05.361 --> 25:07.095
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

25:07.129 --> 25:08.396
And we doubt that
Ben knows, and someone
has to tell him.

25:08.431 --> 25:09.965
No.

25:09.999 --> 25:11.066
What if she traps him  a seco?

25:11.100 --> 25:13.034
He wasn't trapped.
He had choices.

25:13.069 --> 25:14.936
And he chose to
get married.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.006
If he's stupid enough
to get her pregnant again,
then that's his problem.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.208
Yeah, and
the baby's problem.

25:20.243 --> 25:22.177
Babies can't help
who their parents are.

25:22.211 --> 25:24.946
Parents can't help
who their kids are either.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.015
They can only do
so much, you know.

25:27.049 --> 25:30.952
We can only do our best
to raise John
to be a good man,

25:30.987 --> 25:33.989
and that's all we can do,
and that may not be enough.

25:38.361 --> 25:40.395
But he'll have
a much better chance

25:40.429 --> 25:43.331
if we do the best
we can together.

25:43.366 --> 25:45.433
Don't make me
take you to that dance.

25:48.636 --> 25:48.636
+

25:52.877 --> 25:55.479
Now, Aces can be
high or low.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.614
So, it goes,
Ace, King, Queen, Jack,

25:57.648 --> 26:01.618
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, and Ace.

26:01.652 --> 26:04.554
The suits are spades,
hearts, clubs,
and diamonds.

26:04.589 --> 26:06.623
No one suit
is higher than another.

26:06.657 --> 26:09.426
The best five card
poker hand wins.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.527
Questions.

26:10.561 --> 26:11.695
How much is the ante?

26:11.729 --> 26:12.896
He said two pennies.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.731
I'll ask them.

26:14.766 --> 26:16.733
Who wants
chocolate chip cookies?

26:16.768 --> 26:18.502
We do!
We do!

26:19.670 --> 26:20.771
Let's go.

26:24.575 --> 26:25.675
Don't look at
my cards.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.944
Who, me?
Of course not.
Run along, kid.

26:31.616 --> 26:34.818
Well, I think I
turned that around,
don't you think?

26:34.852 --> 26:36.420
I think so.

26:36.454 --> 26:37.788
But if I were you,
I'd let them win at cards.

26:37.822 --> 26:39.623
Oh, absolutely.

26:39.657 --> 26:42.692
And the pot is
going to be big.
I mean, big.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.860
$10. Maybe more.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.563
Two bucks will be plenty.
Two each.

26:46.597 --> 26:48.465
I don't want you to
bribe them.

26:48.499 --> 26:50.867
But that's one of the things
I do best, bribes.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.803
You better
knock that stuff off

26:52.837 --> 26:54.838
if you ever want
a chance with me.

26:56.507 --> 26:57.741
I would like a chance
with you.

26:57.775 --> 26:59.543
Hmm.

26:59.577 --> 27:00.877
Would you maybe like to
go out of the house
without the kids

27:00.912 --> 27:02.712
next Saturday night?

27:02.747 --> 27:05.849
Maybe take in a movie,
have some dinner?

27:08.553 --> 27:11.455
Or we could take them
if you want.

27:11.489 --> 27:13.824
Maybe Grandma Kathleen
will look after them.

27:13.858 --> 27:15.892
I'd hate to
ask Tom again.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.595
You're calling
that broad in there
Grandma?

27:18.629 --> 27:20.597
Sorry.

27:20.631 --> 27:23.800
That's no broad,
that's Tom's mother.

27:23.835 --> 27:25.836
I am going to have to
work on you.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.605
But not too much.

27:30.842 --> 27:34.478
I can cook,
I just don't have
any pots and pans.

27:34.512 --> 27:36.379
I haven't had time
to get all that stuff.

27:36.414 --> 27:37.781
Oh, yeah,
what can you cook?

27:37.815 --> 27:42.586
The basics.
Scrambled eggs, hamburgers,
and macaroni and cheese

27:42.620 --> 27:44.387
from a package.

27:44.422 --> 27:46.756
I can only bake.
I bake cookies.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.892
Cooking's basically
chemistry, right?

27:48.926 --> 27:52.462
We're both good in chemistry,
we should be able to learn
to cook.

27:52.497 --> 27:54.664
Maybe we should
take cooking lessons
together.

27:56.601 --> 27:59.736
Oh, no, don't get that
I-want-to-marry-you look
in your eye again.

27:59.770 --> 28:02.472
Why do you keep
accusing me of wanting
to marry you?

28:02.507 --> 28:03.874
Because I want you to
want to marry me,

28:03.908 --> 28:06.710
because I want to want
to marry you.

28:06.744 --> 28:08.912
But you don't?

28:08.946 --> 28:10.680
But I don't know if I do.

28:10.715 --> 28:13.617
And you don't know
if you want to marry me
either.

28:13.651 --> 28:17.487
We don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do,
or you're not ready to do.

28:17.522 --> 28:19.823
We can just hang out, talk.

28:20.791 --> 28:22.592
Did my mother
talk to you?

28:23.961 --> 28:25.729
She's like a hypnotist!

28:25.763 --> 28:27.797
She did hint around
that we could wait.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.833
Can we leave
my mother out of this
relationship?

28:29.867 --> 28:30.967
I doubt it.

28:31.002 --> 28:33.670
She can't keep us
from having sex.

28:33.704 --> 28:35.639
But she can try.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.574
She and Jack.

28:37.608 --> 28:38.842
Jack?

28:38.876 --> 28:40.710
Jack said something
to you?

28:40.745 --> 28:44.714
He wants you to go
to the senior dance with him,
just as a friend.

28:44.749 --> 28:47.751
Would you Jack
take me to the senior dance,
just as a friend?

28:49.787 --> 28:50.787
What do you think?

28:59.597 --> 29:00.697
Again?

29:00.731 --> 29:01.898
I'm not drunk.

29:03.601 --> 29:05.535
I just have a headache
from motion sickness.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.904
I was riding around
on the bus all afternoon.

29:07.939 --> 29:10.440
Why didn't you
just go home?

29:10.474 --> 29:12.676
Oh, because Ricky's mother
would kill me if...

29:13.878 --> 29:17.480
If she knew I had a beer.
I only had one beer.

29:17.515 --> 29:20.817
The bus stop was
in front of a liquor store.

29:22.853 --> 29:24.921
Okay, I'm lying,
I had more than
one beer.

29:24.956 --> 29:27.457
I had several beers.

29:27.491 --> 29:30.694
Your dad sent
a big guy with white hair
out to look for me.

29:30.728 --> 29:31.861
He found me.

29:37.602 --> 29:42.706
Hi. My name is Ben.
And I don't want to be
an alcoholic.

29:42.740 --> 29:43.940
Neither do I, but...

29:45.509 --> 29:46.610
But?

29:47.812 --> 29:51.715
I guess I'm just
a big fat failure
at everything, huh?

29:51.749 --> 29:54.951
Not at everything.
Your son's
a pretty nice guy.

29:54.986 --> 29:56.653
My son, Ricky?

29:56.687 --> 29:58.888
Oh, he's not my son,
he's Margaret's son.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.924
I'm just his birth mother.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.794
Oh, come on,
she didn't do everything.

30:04.829 --> 30:07.964
She didn't
inspire him not to drink.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.635
I don't know about that.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.705
You certainly
inspired me
not to drink.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.976
Which is important,
because

30:20.011 --> 30:22.946
I'm sure,
as your friend Bill
probably knew,

30:22.980 --> 30:25.682
it's really important
to stay away from alcohol.

30:25.716 --> 30:27.550
Especially if you

30:28.853 --> 30:34.691
had a parent, or parents,
who have or had issues
with alcohol.

30:35.593 --> 30:36.826
Leo?
No.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.729
My mom.

30:39.764 --> 30:41.731
And her mom.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.534
And her dad.

30:45.736 --> 30:49.506
Apparently I come
from a long line of
alcoholics.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.742
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

30:52.777 --> 30:54.511
I didn't either.

30:56.714 --> 30:59.749
Well, I don't recommend it
for anyone.

30:59.784 --> 31:01.918
Even if you don't come
from a long line,

31:03.721 --> 31:05.522
you could be
first in line.

31:07.558 --> 31:09.826
I think that's a good idea
for Ben to talk to her.

31:09.860 --> 31:11.895
Good for Ben and
good for her.

31:11.929 --> 31:13.730
Sometimes people can
hear things better

31:13.764 --> 31:15.665
when it don't come
from family, you know?

31:15.700 --> 31:16.900
Yeah, I guess
that's true.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.769
I can't put her back
in the office, you know.

31:19.804 --> 31:22.672
I really enjoyed
having her there, but,

31:22.707 --> 31:23.840
I think she
needs to get...

31:23.874 --> 31:25.709
Sober?
And stay sober?

31:25.743 --> 31:27.944
Yeah, I think so.

31:27.978 --> 31:31.014
It's nice that
you're even letting her
work at the butcher shop.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.784
Oh. Okay. Well.

31:34.819 --> 31:36.653
That's
understandable, too.

31:36.687 --> 31:39.789
I just told her yesterday,
"If you continue
to go to meetings

31:39.824 --> 31:40.924
"and stay sober,

31:40.958 --> 31:43.460
"you could work
at the butcher shop."

31:43.494 --> 31:46.529
Unfortunately, I found her
walking around today

31:46.797 --> 31:48.465
not sober.

31:48.499 --> 31:51.568
All right, she'll have
to find another job then.

31:51.602 --> 31:53.903
You know I have
a soft spot for
people in trouble.

31:53.938 --> 31:57.707
For women who
have a lot of challenges.

31:57.742 --> 31:59.676
I kind of heard
about Ben's mother.

31:59.710 --> 32:03.680
I didn't want to tell him,
but I felt I had to.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.749
It's a lot to deal with
with everything he's been
going through,

32:05.783 --> 32:07.550
but he's going to
have to deal with it.

32:07.585 --> 32:09.686
He's going to have to
grow up and deal with life.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.788
And he's going to have to
do that sober.

32:11.822 --> 32:14.891
I have a drink once
in a while, but,
I don't get drunk.

32:14.925 --> 32:17.861
I don't drink,
I can't stand
the smell of it.

32:17.895 --> 32:21.865
It brings back
too many bad memories,
and I just don't get it.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.800
That's good.

32:23.834 --> 32:27.871
Maybe you could
stay close to Ben,
be a friend to him.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.672
I wish I were
a better friend to him.

32:29.707 --> 32:31.708
I need to
tell him something,

32:31.742 --> 32:36.413
but just don't think
I'm the person to talk
to him about this.

32:36.447 --> 32:39.516
Sometimes women
make you do stupid things,
you know?

32:39.917 --> 32:41.484
Like what?

32:41.519 --> 32:44.854
Like Amy is making me
tell you this.

32:44.889 --> 32:48.591
Adrian is hoping to
get Ben to get her
pregnant again.

32:48.626 --> 32:53.430
You don't mean now,
you mean sometime in
the distant future?

32:53.464 --> 32:55.765
Now.
And how would I
have heard that?

32:55.800 --> 32:57.434
How can I tell him
I heard that

32:57.468 --> 32:59.436
without telling him
who I heard it from?

32:59.470 --> 33:00.603
Please don't.

33:00.871 --> 33:02.672
Adrian.

33:02.706 --> 33:03.873
What is she thinking?

33:08.813 --> 33:11.681
Just wanted to let
you know,
I'm leaving the house.

33:13.684 --> 33:15.919
Habit.
Just checking to see
what time it is.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.521
What time is it?
Almost 11:00.

33:18.556 --> 33:20.690
What's there to do
at 11:00
on a Saturday night?

33:20.724 --> 33:22.926
That's what time
the parties usually start,
around 11:00.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.561
Really?
Yeah.

33:24.595 --> 33:26.596
All right, well,
drive safely.

33:27.598 --> 33:28.698
I will.

33:29.867 --> 33:31.835
I don't really want
to go out,

33:31.869 --> 33:34.737
but, I have to find
a date to the dance.

33:34.772 --> 33:36.473
I have to go
to that dance.

33:37.608 --> 33:38.775
I don't if you...

33:40.611 --> 33:43.780
Oh, no, Jack,
I'm sorry.

33:43.814 --> 33:46.549
But I'm very flattered
you asked, but, no.

33:46.584 --> 33:47.851
And I'm sure
you can find a date.

33:47.885 --> 33:49.719
No, I really can't.

33:49.753 --> 33:51.421
Maybe there are
some other guys
who are going

33:51.455 --> 33:52.789
that don't have dates and
you can all go together.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.491
No. I don't think so.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.764
Just wanted to
say goodnight.

34:01.799 --> 34:03.500
Good night, Kathleen.

34:03.534 --> 34:04.534
Jack.

34:04.568 --> 34:05.768
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

34:10.541 --> 34:13.810
I had a really nice time.
Thank you for dinner
and everything.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.712
I'll talk to you
tomorrow.
Mmm-hmm.

34:18.649 --> 34:20.550
I thought you
were staying over.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.652
No, I decided
not to stay over.

34:22.686 --> 34:23.853
Okay.

34:23.888 --> 34:27.489
And we didn't do
anything either.

34:27.525 --> 34:30.460
I decided
I think I'm just gonna be
a little smarter this time.

34:30.494 --> 34:31.793
Wouldn't that have to
be next time?

34:31.829 --> 34:34.531
And what I'm saying is.

34:34.565 --> 34:36.866
I think I like a guy
that can make me wait.

34:37.801 --> 34:39.369
Goodnight.

34:39.402 --> 34:40.469
Goodnight.

34:42.406 --> 34:43.473
(EXHALES)

34:48.846 --> 34:50.780
Oh, hi.

34:50.813 --> 34:52.649
I was just about to
go to bed.

34:53.551 --> 34:54.817
How are you?

34:54.851 --> 34:57.720
I'm okay.
I'm surprisingly okay.

34:58.689 --> 35:00.490
How are you?

35:00.524 --> 35:02.525
I'm fine.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.461
Excited about
the dance next week.

35:05.496 --> 35:07.463
Yeah, should be fun.

35:07.498 --> 35:09.666
I guess I should go
pick up some condoms.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.601
Hmm?
Little joke.

35:11.635 --> 35:13.503
Senior dance joke.

35:13.537 --> 35:16.639
Sometimes seniors
get carried away
at those dances,

35:16.674 --> 35:18.808
and go out and
do things
they shouldn't.

35:18.842 --> 35:22.879
Well, we're married.

35:22.913 --> 35:27.650
So, we can have sex
if we want to.

35:27.685 --> 35:30.687
Even if we're just friends
pretending to be married.

35:30.721 --> 35:33.656
Yeah.
Of course we can.
If we want.

35:35.593 --> 35:36.693
Goodnight, Adrian.

35:36.727 --> 35:37.794
Goodnight, Ben.

35:41.465 --> 35:42.532
(SIGHS)

35:47.638 --> 35:49.806
Oh. Hi.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.775
You fell asleep
before I got out of
the shower and into bed.

35:53.744 --> 35:55.745
You smell really nice.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.846
Thank you.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.748
Goodnight.
Oh, come on!

35:58.782 --> 36:00.850
We still haven't
done anything
on our new sofa bed.

36:00.884 --> 36:02.485
Oh. All right.

36:02.519 --> 36:03.653
"Oh, all right"?

36:03.687 --> 36:05.788
I'll do it if I don't have to
take you to that dance.

36:05.823 --> 36:07.590
You have to take
me to that dance.

36:07.625 --> 36:08.691
You know what the theme is?

36:08.726 --> 36:10.493
No, I don't know,
what is it?

36:10.527 --> 36:12.528
Teens Are
the Parents of Tomorrow.

36:12.563 --> 36:14.631
What?
Who came up
with that theme?

36:14.665 --> 36:16.799
Someone who
doesn't want us there,
probably.

36:16.834 --> 36:18.468
Still want to go?

36:18.502 --> 36:19.535
Who doesn't
want us there?
Me.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.405
Wait. So that's
not the theme?

36:22.439 --> 36:25.508
No. But, I don't want
us there, and we
don't have a babysitter.

36:25.542 --> 36:26.643
We'll get one.

36:27.711 --> 36:29.512
Come on.

36:29.546 --> 36:31.481
If you love me,
you won't make me
do this.

36:31.515 --> 36:32.782
And if you love me...

36:36.099 --> 36:36.099
+

36:36.323 --> 36:37.457
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

36:52.439 --> 36:54.474
I'm a terrible dancer.

36:54.508 --> 36:55.575
(LAUGHS)

36:58.612 --> 37:01.481
I don't care.
You're a wonderful man.

37:01.515 --> 37:03.683
You promised
we'd just stay an hour.

37:03.717 --> 37:06.452
Uh-huh.
Unless you're having
a really good time.

37:06.487 --> 37:07.720
It's the best time
I've ever had,

37:07.755 --> 37:10.557
except for maybe every
single night we've been
in bed together.

37:10.591 --> 37:12.525
(LAUGHS)

37:12.560 --> 37:14.661
I don't think I'd
count band camp.

37:14.695 --> 37:16.396
I would.

37:16.430 --> 37:17.497
You enjoyed that?

37:17.531 --> 37:19.499
I was too scared
to enjoy it.

37:19.533 --> 37:20.500
You were scared?

37:20.534 --> 37:22.435
Yeah, Amy, I was.

37:22.469 --> 37:24.537
I actually thought I
might have feelings
for someone,

37:24.572 --> 37:25.638
and it scared me.

37:25.673 --> 37:28.508
By someone,
you do mean me,
don't you?

37:28.542 --> 37:29.609
What do you think?

37:32.479 --> 37:35.481
I think I should call Lauren
to make sure John's all right.

37:35.516 --> 37:38.284
John?
You better see if
Lauren's all right.

37:38.319 --> 37:39.385
I'll be right back.

37:52.499 --> 37:54.534
This was really
nice of Daniel
to do this.

37:54.568 --> 37:56.369
He'd do anything
for me.

37:56.403 --> 37:58.371
Sure, he's not
having sex with you.

37:58.405 --> 37:59.472
We'll see.

38:15.389 --> 38:16.556
Two can play this game.

38:16.590 --> 38:18.524
What game?
The waiting game.

38:20.461 --> 38:21.594
I'm surprised you
play it so well,

38:21.629 --> 38:23.663
what with no
experience waiting
and l.

38:25.532 --> 38:26.566
I really like you.

38:27.534 --> 38:29.402
I really like you.

38:30.671 --> 38:33.606
I didn't get to go
to my senior dance.

38:33.641 --> 38:35.575
It's kind of nice
being back in high school.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.412
Any chance we could...

38:39.446 --> 38:40.380
Nope.

38:47.287 --> 38:48.554
People are talking.

38:48.589 --> 38:50.256
I don't care.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.226
What are they
saying now?

38:53.260 --> 38:55.261
How beautiful you are.

38:55.295 --> 38:56.562
Really?
Really.

38:56.597 --> 39:00.366
Beautiful enough that
you would
sleep with me tonight?

39:01.602 --> 39:03.603
Just for old time's sake.

39:04.438 --> 39:05.505
I can't.

39:05.539 --> 39:08.274
(CHUCKLES)
I've heard that before.

39:08.308 --> 39:12.512
Yeah, I know.
But before,
we weren't friends.

39:12.546 --> 39:16.349
Now we're friends,
and as your friend,

39:16.383 --> 39:19.452
and your legal husband,

39:19.486 --> 39:23.289
I would never do
anything to hurt you
again, never.

39:29.463 --> 39:32.365
<i>LAUREN: (OVER PHONE)
We're fine here.
We're having a good time.</i>

39:32.399 --> 39:35.234
I don't think I want
a baby of my own
any time soon,

39:35.269 --> 39:37.236
but I'm good
for right now.

39:37.271 --> 39:39.372
And I think
John's falling asleep.

39:39.406 --> 39:42.241
Okay, well,
maybe I should just say
goodnight to him.

39:42.276 --> 39:43.643
You said goodnight.

39:43.677 --> 39:46.345
And I think talking to him
will only make him
want you to come home.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.381
Yeah. Okay.

39:48.415 --> 39:50.383
Well. I won't
talk to him then.

39:50.417 --> 39:55.321
Oh, Lauren?
I think someone might be
coming by to see you.

39:55.355 --> 39:56.456
<i>And you should
let him in.</i>

39:56.490 --> 39:58.391
What? Who?

39:58.425 --> 40:00.293
Uh, Jesse?

40:00.327 --> 40:01.427
I have to go.
