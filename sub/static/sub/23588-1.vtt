03:37.484 --> 03:39.554
She may be a little late.
Will you please wait for her?

03:39.654 --> 03:41.617
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.588
Good morning.

04:47.688 --> 04:51.722
Well, what complaint have you
got to add to the world's misery?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.929
- No complaints at all. That is...
- Then you can't be a teacher.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.898
If you are not a teacher,
you've got no right in my kitchen.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.102
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like junket.

05:01.202 --> 05:03.304
But when it looks
like junket, it is junket.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.340
- You know what Miss Elvira said about it?
- No, but I...

05:06.440 --> 05:10.611
She said, Really, dear, can't we admit
the junkets just the weest bit poor?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.880
- You know what I said?
- No, but I would like...

05:12.980 --> 05:16.217
I said, it's just as stupid
to talk about poor junket...

05:16.317 --> 05:18.085
as it is to talk about good junket.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.322
Junket is junket, I said,
and no matter what you do with it...

05:21.422 --> 05:24.921
it still tastes like swill
and swallows like slime.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.329
Haven't seen you around
here before, have I?

05:28.429 --> 05:32.633
No, my little girl is just entering today,
and I can't find anyone to turn her over to.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.435
No, of course you can't.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.039
What little discipline there was
among these junket-eaters...

05:38.139 --> 05:40.641
went to hell the day Miss
Benton was taken to hospital.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.210
We've only just arrived in
England a few days ago...

05:43.310 --> 05:46.881
and I have an appointment to let the
moving men into our new apartment...

05:46.981 --> 05:49.784
Everybody has his troubles.
Where's your little girl?

05:49.884 --> 05:53.220
In the First Day room. When I
telephoned to say we'd be late...

05:53.320 --> 05:56.257
they said I should take her
to the First Day room.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.925
Isn't that a cute name for it?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.928
The teachers will be
down at the 10:00 bell.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.265
That's only 10 minutes.
I'll look after her till then.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.300
Maybe I'd better wait
until the teacher...

06:06.400 --> 06:09.070
No, nonsense, you just go.
You'll be late.

06:09.170 --> 06:12.706
- Her name is Bunny Lake. And she's in...
- Yes, I know. The First Day room.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.201
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.667
I'm sorry I'm late.
Have you been waiting long?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.333
Only a bit, ma'am.
It's quite all right.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.112
These three bags go upstairs
into the smaller bedroom.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.575
- And those go into the large bedroom.
- Righto, ma'am.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.093
- Yes?
- <i>Hi!</i>

07:39.193 --> 07:40.394
Hello, Steven.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.463
I wanted to check if
you got there all right.

07:42.563 --> 07:46.000
Of course I got here.
They're unloading.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.835
I'm sorry I can't
help you, darling...

07:47.935 --> 07:51.005
but some Congolese general is flying in.
I've got to cover it.

07:51.105 --> 07:54.308
New York thinks there may be a
student demonstration at the airport.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.609
How did you like the school?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.745
I don't know yet.
I didn't see anybody.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.247
The Armstrongs sent their
kids to the same school.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.584
They came home bleeding only twice.
Seriously, it's a good school.

08:03.684 --> 08:07.454
Please be on time for dinner.
I'm making fried chicken just for you.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.951
- I'll be home at 6:30 sharp. Love you.
- <i>Bye-Bye.</i>

08:34.748 --> 08:36.850
The books stay in here...

08:36.950 --> 08:40.020
and the typewriter goes
on top of the desk.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.914
And this carton goes in the kitchen.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.231
Thank you. You've been such a help.

08:50.331 --> 08:54.473
I'm still trying to figure out
your money. Is that all right?

08:54.574 --> 08:56.604
You're doing beautifully,
if I might say so.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.406
- One is more than generous. Goodbye.
- What's wrong with you?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.970
- You must be bonkers.
- Why, thank you.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.768
- Is somebody...
- Hear that, Samantha?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.263
Our new tenants have arrived.

09:30.371 --> 09:34.769
Hello. We've come back from
wettest Worcestershire...

09:35.109 --> 09:37.743
Samantha and I. This is Samantha.

09:38.379 --> 09:41.615
If we hadn't been away,
we'd have organized a small...

09:41.715 --> 09:44.406
but vociferous reception committee.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.586
Who are you?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.753
Among other things,
your new landlord and friend.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.793
I hope my little African
faces didn't disturb you.

09:52.893 --> 09:57.086
Of course not. I'm sorry, but I
do have a lot of unpacking to do.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.295
- Carry on.
- Thank you.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.581
This one was a gift from
my fan club in Ghana.

10:19.153 --> 10:21.221
You can wear it, if you like.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.251
I believe it's marvelous
for fertility.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.893
- That's not exactly my problem, Mister...
- Wilson.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.765
Wilson. Horatio Wilson.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.564
Poet, playwright...

10:36.270 --> 10:40.372
dropper of alcoholic bricks, also.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.450
Am I totally unknown to you?

10:49.550 --> 10:51.485
We've just arrived in England.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.753
From Siberia, I presume.

10:54.121 --> 10:58.052
That might possibly explain
your bizarre ignorance.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.028
Mr. Wilson, I hope
you'll forgive me...

11:01.128 --> 11:04.058
but I really must get
my marketing done.

11:15.476 --> 11:19.737
I have other African heads,
small pickled ones, in my apartment.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.485
Do drop in anytime you'd care to
meet some unsuccessful politicians.

11:24.585 --> 11:27.688
Thank you. That would be lovely.
Now I really must go.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.717
<i>A bientot,</i> duchess.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.823
Wave, Samantha. Go on,
wave to the nice young lady.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.020
They're late. It's absolute
chaos with Miss Benton away.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.789
I don't know. Elvira seems
to be coping manfully.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.422
I'm not altogether sure.
Jamie lost his socks again yesterday.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.728
Socks just don't
disappear into thin air.

12:41.828 --> 12:45.332
It's obvious she put them on some
other child who came without socks.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.896
Not tremendously encouraging.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.210
- Excuse me. Have you got a minute?
- A lifetime. Can I help you?

12:56.310 --> 12:59.313
It's about my little girl.
She just entered today...

12:59.413 --> 13:02.449
and I'd like to meet her teacher.
When there's time, of course.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.775
Her teacher will be with the
class when it comes down.

13:11.959 --> 13:12.960
Good afternoon.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.896
I beg your pardon. Could you
tell me where the fours are?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.398
The fours are packing up.
These are the babies.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.867
What a big boy Jamie is.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.703
And what a heartbreaker.
When we saw him this morning...

13:22.803 --> 13:26.240
in the First Day room, my Bunny
just about fell in love with him.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.601
She'd have fallen out soon enough.
He's got a foul temper. Bye-bye, now.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.150
Hello, darling.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.830
Had a nice morning?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.522
Excuse me, what class
is your little girl in?

13:52.623 --> 13:55.903
- The fours.
- So is mine, but I can't seem to find her.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.464
Miss Daphne's in charge of the fours.
She could tell you.

14:00.941 --> 14:05.601
I don't see her, though.
Sort of tall, and dark, and 30-ish.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.115
That's the classroom up there.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.150
But I don't see Miss Daphne.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.816
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.689
Are you looking for something?

16:02.095 --> 16:05.399
Of course I'm looking for something.
What did you think I was doing?

16:05.499 --> 16:06.967
I can't always tell.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.569
I'm looking for my daughter,
Bunny Lake.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.505
- How old is she?
- Four.

16:11.605 --> 16:12.973
The fours have already left.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.575
I know, only Bunny wasn't with them.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.810
Are you Miss Daphne?

16:16.910 --> 16:20.313
No. Miss Daphne has a bad tooth and
went screaming off to the dentist.

16:20.413 --> 16:24.117
Anyhow, you're in the three room,
the fours are next door.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.819
I've been there. It's empty.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.256
- It's Bunny's first day...
- Perhaps she's gone down for her dinner.

16:29.356 --> 16:33.560
- But she's not supposed to stay for lunch.
- Did you tell us that this morning?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.195
No. You see, we were late...

16:35.295 --> 16:38.298
We can't be expected to
read your mind, can we?

16:38.398 --> 16:39.966
Come along. We'll have a look-see.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.868
Is Bunny here?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.500
Is a Bunny Lake here, please?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.640
What's she look like, Dorothy?

16:46.740 --> 16:49.109
I don't know that I've
ever seen the girl.

16:49.209 --> 16:53.714
She has red tights and a white
blouse with short sleeves...

16:53.814 --> 16:57.279
and a blue pinafore dress.
She's blonde, and...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.921
don't you watch the children here?
Isn't anybody in charge?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.348
We'll find her. Don't worry.

17:05.090 --> 17:08.060
Haven't you seen a
little girl called Bunny?

17:08.161 --> 17:09.930
- No.
- About your age?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.857
- No.
- A new girl.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.135
With a dress, just like yours.

17:15.234 --> 17:18.105
There's no point in
questioning the children.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.440
What do you mean, no point?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.944
It's my child, my little girl,
not some lost pair of socks.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.247
Please, Mrs. Lake.
We mustn't get emotional.

17:27.347 --> 17:31.074
I don't need your advice.
I want my child.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.386
Who's in charge of this madhouse?

17:33.486 --> 17:37.124
All I need is someone who can cook,
and by tomorrow morning.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.592
<i>Will you take a Spanish girl?</i>

17:38.692 --> 17:41.094
I want her to cook,
not speak English.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.696
<i>She won't take less than 'L8. 10.</i>

17:42.796 --> 17:44.531
We'll have to pay it then, won't we?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.133
- Are you the one...
- Just a moment.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.269
- <i>Shall I send her to see you?</i>
- Yes. Send her by 8:00 tomorrow.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.539
- <i>Right. Lopez is the name.</i>
- Thank you, Mrs. Twigg.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.909
The cook walked out just because
I said something about the junket.

17:56.009 --> 17:58.111
That may be the least
of our worries, Elvira.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.714
The cook who walked out,
is she a German woman?

18:00.814 --> 18:04.084
- That's one way to describe her.
- What time did the cook leave?

18:04.184 --> 18:08.121
Around 11:15, I suppose.
It was in the middle of cooking lunch.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.756
Brace yourself, Elvira.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.325
We can't seem to put our hands
on one of the children.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.321
- Which one?
- My little girl. Bunny Lake.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.665
I don't recall any Bunny,
or any Lake.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.101
But you're the one I spoke
to on the telephone.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.503
- I recognize your voice.
- When was this?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.739
This morning. Don't you remember?

18:25.839 --> 18:29.142
I telephoned because it was Bunny's
first day and we were late.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.410
Yes, now I remember.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.080
And I took her to the First Day room,
just as you told me to.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.850
But now we don't seem
to be able to find her.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.819
- How old is she?
- She's a four.

18:38.919 --> 18:42.322
The fours are all gone home ages ago,
except those that stay to dinner.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.391
Will you all please stop saying that?

18:44.491 --> 18:49.296
The fours are not all on their way home.
Mine isn't, and she isn't at dinner, either.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.631
If she's a four, I imagine
Miss Daphne would...

18:51.731 --> 18:55.025
Miss Daphne went home
with a toothache!

18:55.235 --> 18:58.305
You don't seem to know very
much about what goes on here.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.608
- A child who's been placed in your...
- <i>London office. Can I help you?</i>

19:01.708 --> 19:03.705
Mr. Steven Lake, please.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.916
She couldn't have
walked out that way.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.486
- She couldn't have walked out at all.
- What do you mean by that?

19:46.586 --> 19:49.656
If she couldn't have walked out by
herself, then someone took her.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.658
- Is that what you're saying?
- Of course not.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.228
I assume you regulate who comes
into this school and who doesn't.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.898
People don't just wander
in off the street, do they?

19:57.998 --> 20:00.934
- Certainly not. We keep...
- Then listen to me for a minute.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.104
Shortly before 10:00,
Bunny was brought into this room.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.606
A little boy about 18 months
old was playing here.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.876
Yes, and I saw the boy later
in the hall with his mother.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.879
The cook promised to keep an eye
on her until the 10:00 recess.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.281
Listen to me.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.317
We all agree she couldn't have
got out of this room by herself.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.421
Barring witchcraft, that can only
mean someone took her out, correct?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.857
- I don't know. I mean...
- I do.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.626
If you'd stop defending
yourself for a minute, Miss...

20:26.726 --> 20:28.561
Smollett, and I'm not
defending myself.

20:28.661 --> 20:32.032
If you would worry less about
yourself and more about this child...

20:32.132 --> 20:36.098
you seem to have misplaced,
we might begin to get somewhere.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.507
Since she couldn't have gone out by
herself, it means someone took her out.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.935
The question is who.
Who took the child out of here?

20:44.544 --> 20:47.247
Think about it.
Calm down and begin to think.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.182
How can I when you scream at me?

20:49.282 --> 20:52.819
- Forgive me, we're all a little overexcited.
- What I was going to say is...

20:52.919 --> 20:56.289
even though someone did
take her out of this room...

20:56.389 --> 20:59.559
it doesn't necessarily mean they
took her out of the school, too.

20:59.659 --> 21:03.488
In which event she'd still be here.
The question is where.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.066
Have you searched the place?

21:06.166 --> 21:08.902
- Of course we have.
- Maybe we'll have better luck.

21:09.002 --> 21:12.305
Your track record, just for today,
hasn't been too dazzling.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.408
So you don't mind if we
look for ourselves, do you?

21:15.508 --> 21:19.667
Not at all. I'll be in the
office if you should need me.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.476
Don't worry, Annie. We'll find her.

21:30.924 --> 21:34.685
We'll start on the top floor
and we'll work our way down.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.903
- What's up there?
- Miss Benton's private flat.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.040
We thought Miss Benton
was in the hospital.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.638
I told you, it's a private flat.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.471
- She could have easily run up here.
- Listen.

21:54.614 --> 21:58.682
<i>It was an underground train
But there was nobody on it...</i>

21:58.885 --> 22:00.587
<i>except this dog.</i>

22:00.687 --> 22:05.290
<i>It was the giants dog, really.
He didn't know that he was on the train.</i>

22:05.892 --> 22:08.788
<i>And this dog had great Big...</i>

22:09.863 --> 22:12.599
<i>huge eyes and the most awful teeth.</i>

22:12.699 --> 22:14.264
Who is it?

22:14.834 --> 22:19.471
<i>But this dog had hundreds of teeth,
just to mash you up with.</i>

22:19.973 --> 22:22.300
<i>To mash you right up and...</i>

22:22.475 --> 22:24.336
Such imagination.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.946
We might think of teeth gnashing.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.807
But mashing... Which is exactly
what they do, of course.

22:31.784 --> 22:35.385
Are you parents? We don't
usually see parents up here.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.558
We're looking for a four-year-old
girl named Bunny Lake.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.627
Have they lost one? How careless.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.521
- Are you Miss Benton?
- No, not at all.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.565
I am Miss Ford.

22:45.665 --> 22:50.097
Miss Benton and I started this school
together, but now I'm retired...

22:50.737 --> 22:52.338
except for my book.

22:52.438 --> 22:55.341
I'm writing a book on
children's fantasies.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.911
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

22:58.011 --> 23:01.669
I have all their little
nightmares on my tape machine.

23:01.948 --> 23:06.252
You don't have bars on these windows.
All the other windows have bars.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.922
The children aren't meant
to come up here now.

23:09.022 --> 23:12.992
Elvira thinks I may frighten them
by asking about their dreams.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.328
But I'll tell you
something in confidence.

23:15.428 --> 23:20.156
Every now and again, one brave
child slips through the defenses.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.163
So, let's hunt, shall we?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.371
Now, what's her name?

23:25.471 --> 23:28.970
Her real name is Felicia,
but we've always called her Bunny.

23:32.378 --> 23:36.783
We have to call, although very often
when they hear the calling...

23:36.883 --> 23:39.108
they hide and laugh at us.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.627
This woman is crazy.

23:47.727 --> 23:51.164
Don't you think we all are,
to one degree or another?

23:51.264 --> 23:54.900
Crazy, I mean. Especially children.

23:58.571 --> 24:02.332
That's why with a child you
have to think of everything.

24:02.642 --> 24:06.278
Your little girl has probably
gone to sleep somewhere.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.178
Yes, you're probably right.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.752
She does take a nap every afternoon.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.417
But where?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.025
Perhaps she's been frightened.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.488
They do go to sleep sometimes
after a bad fright.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.397
Quite sensible of them, too.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.894
- What could have happened to frighten her?
- Who could say?

24:29.035 --> 24:31.271
What happened to her?
What are you hinting at?

24:31.371 --> 24:34.631
- That something happened to Bunny?
- Easy, honey.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.473
Miss Ford, if you do know something,
please level with us.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.313
I wouldn't want to embarrass you.

24:40.413 --> 24:43.883
- Embarrass me? How would you do that?
- By calling the police.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.846
What an enchanting idea.
The telephone is in here.

24:48.288 --> 24:50.888
Dreadful painting of Madge, this.

24:51.024 --> 24:53.493
Makes her look like Mother
Earth or something.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.662
You wouldn't mind my
calling the police?

24:55.762 --> 24:59.065
It's exactly what I should do
myself were I the child's father.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.268
I'm not her father, I'm her uncle.
Ann is my sister.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.536
Curiouser and curiouser.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.008
You've no right to come up here.
Absolutely no right at all.

25:09.108 --> 25:13.213
We have every right in the world to be
here, or any other place in this building.

25:13.313 --> 25:15.548
You seem to have been
a little careless, Elvira.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.918
- Call the police, Steve.
- The police? No, Mr. Lake. Please.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.822
Miss Benton wouldn't like that.
She just wouldn't have it.

25:22.922 --> 25:27.286
<i>Au contraire.</i> I'm sure Madge
would want us to protect our good name.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.163
Please, we can look again.
I've rung up Miss Daphne.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.765
She'll be back from the
dentist within half an hour.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.968
I'm sure she can explain everything.

25:35.068 --> 25:39.034
Miss Benton wouldn't want the police
dragged into The Little Peoples Garden.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.554
- Unbelievable.
- It's their free play.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.623
- What are they doing?
- Exactly as they like.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.057
Expressing themselves.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.059
They must find that
tremendously hard work.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.095
Don't you want to look anywhere else?

26:02.195 --> 26:05.887
No, I don't think so. I've got men
peering about all over the shop.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.732
I just wanted to get to
understand the place a little.

26:11.104 --> 26:13.067
- Miss Daphne Musgrave?
- Yes.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.841
How's the tooth feeling now?

26:14.941 --> 26:17.075
- Better, thank you.
- Good.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.802
I swear to God...

26:54.480 --> 26:56.705
if only she's all right...

26:57.750 --> 27:00.885
I'll never let her out
of my sight again...

27:01.287 --> 27:03.148
as long as I live.

27:12.198 --> 27:16.391
You'll feel pretty silly along
about the time she's hitting 30.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.097
It's all my fault.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.673
I never should have
left her here. Never.

27:25.611 --> 27:29.508
Supt. Newhouse wants to talk
to you now, if you'll be so kind.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.446
Just you, madam,
at the moment, please.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.919
What did you say to this teacher?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.888
After you'd handed
over your little girl.

28:08.988 --> 28:13.292
You mean the one they call Daphne?
The one that they said went to the dentist?

28:13.392 --> 28:15.492
Have you found her yet?

28:18.197 --> 28:20.466
- I didn't say anything to her.
- How was that?

28:20.566 --> 28:24.370
I didn't say anything because I didn't
see her. I didn't see the teachers,

28:24.471 --> 28:28.841
just the cook and she said she'd keep an eye
on her. It was only for five or 10 minutes.

28:28.941 --> 28:33.407
I was late. So I left her there all alone,
with a baby half her age.

28:35.615 --> 28:37.650
We found Daphne Musgrave.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.552
- Where?
- At the dentist.

28:39.652 --> 28:41.754
She says she never saw your child.

28:41.854 --> 28:45.291
She says she went into the First
Day room. Isn't that what it's called?

28:45.391 --> 28:49.028
At about 10:05. The cook told
her there was a child there.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.997
Two. Bunny and this baby.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.666
Miss Daphne says the
cook said child. Singular.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.735
She was quite definite about that.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.871
Sure enough, when she went in,
there was a child. The baby.

28:58.971 --> 29:03.443
So if you left Bunny in there at...
What time did you say?

29:03.543 --> 29:05.574
Almost 9:55.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.347
Then it was during the next
10 minutes that she went off.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.615
Went off?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.617
On her voyage of discovery.

29:11.717 --> 29:15.421
But the window and front door were locked.
I'm sure I heard it lock behind me.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.655
let's go and see, shall we?

29:19.292 --> 29:22.928
You must think I'm a terrible mother,
leaving her that way.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.198
No, Mrs. Lake. I don't know
anything about you yet.

29:28.568 --> 29:31.237
Andrews, see what you
can learn about this cook.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.506
If you can't find her,
send out a general call.

29:33.606 --> 29:34.874
Very good, sir.

29:34.974 --> 29:39.975
I must now, I suppose, enter the personality
of a four-year-old female child...

29:40.680 --> 29:43.716
possessed with a conviction
forbidden doors are to be opened.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.686
Yes, Bunny would feel like
that about forbidden doors.

29:46.786 --> 29:50.820
I've been put in there, and I assume
my mother has gone off and left me.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.694
Well, that's how it must
have seemed to a child.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.292
Maybe I'd try this door.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.765
Empty, obviously, at this hour.

29:59.865 --> 30:03.703
Somewhere a hymn of nauseating banality
is being sung by the punctual children.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.971
They were singing, yes.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.205
So I cross the hall...

30:09.742 --> 30:11.177
and office.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.037
No joy there. And now...

30:15.548 --> 30:17.238
the kitchen.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.543
The cook was standing right
there when I talked to her.

30:23.623 --> 30:25.814
- Is this junket?
- Yes.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.584
I'm terribly fond of the stuff.

30:30.262 --> 30:34.489
- Do you think they'd mind?
- Not from what the cook said about it.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.195
That door. Was that
door open or shut?

30:39.538 --> 30:41.228
Shut, I think.

30:42.308 --> 30:46.946
If she had wandered out this way, she
probably would have gone through it...

30:47.046 --> 30:51.808
- and on to the great outside world beyond.
- But the cook would have stopped her.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.680
Perhaps.

30:55.855 --> 30:59.991
I think that covers the possibilities here.
Don't you worry, Mrs. Lake.

31:00.626 --> 31:03.963
Even if she did wander out this way,
she can't have gone far.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.390
Not in three hours, at most.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.731
We'll circulate her description.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.403
- She's not far away.
- Thank you.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.039
- Have you got a snap?
- What?

31:21.147 --> 31:23.110
This sort of thing.

31:23.783 --> 31:26.886
Taken at Cromer Sands on
a dull August afternoon.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.989
Almost useless for identification,
but it pleases Grandmother.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.657
- A snapshot.
- That's right.

31:31.757 --> 31:35.859
No, I don't have one. The photo albums,
most of our things haven't arrived yet.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.786
- Would your brother have one?
- Possibly, I'm not sure.

31:43.769 --> 31:47.461
- All of your family are most elusive.
- Looking for me?

31:48.074 --> 31:50.799
- Are you Mrs. Lakes brother?
- That's right.

31:51.811 --> 31:55.037
- Steven Lake.
- Supt. Newhouse.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.452
I was upstairs having another
session with Ada Ford.

31:59.552 --> 32:00.886
Who's she?

32:00.986 --> 32:05.024
Sort of the witch in residence.
You know what she told me?

32:05.124 --> 32:08.661
This has happened before in this school,
only with two kids instead of one.

32:08.761 --> 32:12.098
A teacher took them to the zoo in
Whipsnade without telling anybody.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.389
- Did they find them?
- Yes.

32:14.567 --> 32:18.897
Safe and sound. But the whole place
went crazy looking for them.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.506
Where's your husband?

32:20.606 --> 32:23.142
You see, Superintendent,
my sisters husband...

32:23.242 --> 32:26.036
I'm not married. I never was.

32:26.679 --> 32:27.747
I see.

32:27.847 --> 32:30.149
I hope the fact that Bunny
is illegitimate won't...

32:30.249 --> 32:32.485
Of course it won't, Mrs... Miss Lake.

32:32.585 --> 32:35.421
Although I assume you do
sometimes call yourself Mrs.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.656
Only when it avoids confusion.
Miss is fine.

32:39.592 --> 32:42.228
Have you a photograph of your niece?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.927
Let me see.

32:48.601 --> 32:51.292
- Excuse me, but isn't...
- No, that's me.

32:51.504 --> 32:56.042
I'm so stupid. Of course I have a picture of
Bunny. It's in her passport at the apartment.

32:56.142 --> 33:00.506
- My cars outside. Do you want me to get it?
- That would be very helpful.

33:01.881 --> 33:05.084
I put your briefcase in the
top drawer of your desk.

33:05.184 --> 33:09.055
Not a trace of the cook.
I've had them send out a general call.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.691
Mr. Lake, this is Sgt. Andrews.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.926
Go with Mr. Lake
to his flat, will you?

33:14.026 --> 33:18.492
Then you can bring him and a photograph
of the little girl back to the station.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.867
- What about me?
- You can come to the station with me.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.829
That's where we keep
all the red tape.

33:46.192 --> 33:49.384
<i>The little tailor
went snip, snip, snip.</i>

33:49.895 --> 33:54.122
<i>Poor flies, cut right
across the middle.</i>

33:54.300 --> 33:57.867
Her hair was...
Her hair is blonde, like mine.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.405
- Eyes?
- Blue.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.907
Thank you, Mrs. Tulk. Weight?

34:02.007 --> 34:03.909
31... No, thank you.

34:04.009 --> 34:07.313
- 32 pounds, I guess.
- Height? Approximately, you understand.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.342
Dark blue pinafore dress.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.610
Dark blue double-breasted coat...

34:15.154 --> 34:17.623
with brass buttons.

34:17.723 --> 34:21.060
Speaks with an American accent...

34:21.159 --> 34:25.126
and will answer to the
name of Bunny Lake.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.658
Message ends. Repeat message.

34:29.235 --> 34:32.404
Attention called: Missing child.

34:32.972 --> 34:36.699
Age: 4 years. Eyes: Blue.

34:36.976 --> 34:41.679
Height: 3 feet, approximately.
Hair: Blond, medium length.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.882
Speaks with an American accent...

34:43.983 --> 34:48.313
<i>and will answer to the
name of Bunny Lake.</i>

35:00.933 --> 35:02.862
My father was a policeman.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.764
Managed to get me into a university.

35:06.171 --> 35:09.306
I think he rather
wanted me to be a poet.

35:09.909 --> 35:14.113
When I told him I wanted to be a
policeman like him, he was horrified.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.677
You'll have no friends, he said.

35:17.049 --> 35:21.520
No single decent human being will
want to speak to you from now on.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.088
I must say he was perfectly right.

35:23.188 --> 35:26.357
Mr. Newhouse, what are we doing here?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.592
What are we doing about Bunny?

35:28.761 --> 35:31.452
We're waiting for
something to happen.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.935
- Yes.
- <i>Can I talk? Are you alone?</i>

35:36.035 --> 35:37.036
No, but go on.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.105
<i>There's nothing here, sir.
Everything seems to have Been removed.</i>

35:40.205 --> 35:41.307
- Everything?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

35:41.407 --> 35:43.642
<i>All the child's possessions
seem to have gone.</i>

35:43.742 --> 35:46.145
- Very interesting.
- <i>What shall we do next, sir?</i>

35:46.245 --> 35:49.415
Stay there, will you? Him, too.
We'll be along.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.983
- And, Andrews.
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

35:51.083 --> 35:53.052
Don't move anything.
Not a thing. Understand?

35:53.152 --> 35:54.341
<i>Righto.</i>

36:42.634 --> 36:45.860
What would anybody want
with Bunny's things?

36:46.138 --> 36:48.203
It's like a nightmare.

36:52.745 --> 36:56.048
- Somebody must have broken in.
- The lock seems to be intact.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.373
Can't see any sign of tampering.

37:01.453 --> 37:06.090
All the child's things are missing:
Mug, bib, one bathrobe, pink...

37:06.258 --> 37:10.189
one nightgown, slippers,
teddy bear, everything.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.931
And the passport, of course.

37:12.031 --> 37:15.434
But it was open when we got here.
Anybody could've come in.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.192
Yes, sir. When we arrived,
we only had to push it.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.799
Was the door open when you left here?

37:24.476 --> 37:26.041
I think so.

37:28.047 --> 37:30.875
I did leave it open
when I went upstairs...

37:32.918 --> 37:34.779
with the groceries.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.518
And I had to make two trips.

37:37.990 --> 37:41.093
So I could have forgotten
to lock it again.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.162
- Has the child ever been here?
- Never.

37:43.262 --> 37:47.592
No. She caught a cold
on the boat coming over.

37:49.168 --> 37:51.837
Today was the first day
that I let her go out.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.300
You were right here this
morning at about what time?

37:57.076 --> 37:58.971
10:15, 10:30.

37:59.078 --> 38:01.313
10:15. Now, did the movers...

38:01.413 --> 38:03.911
They left a few minutes after?

38:05.551 --> 38:07.514
I started to unpack.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.022
Then a man came in.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.091
- The door was unlocked?
- What man?

38:12.191 --> 38:14.259
- Mr. Wilson. He had a key.
- Who is this Wilson?

38:14.359 --> 38:18.230
Our landlord, but that doesn't give him
the right to come barging in here.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.466
So I went to buy some groceries.

38:20.566 --> 38:23.360
- Did you leave Mr. Wilson alone here?
- No.

38:23.936 --> 38:25.728
He left when I did.

38:26.271 --> 38:29.872
How long were you here after you
had come back from marketing?

38:30.809 --> 38:34.706
Just long enough to unload the groceries.
I had to go get Bunny.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.548
Yes, very well.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.551
Mr. Lake, do you have personal
possessions of any value?

38:39.651 --> 38:42.183
Very few, and nothings missing.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.650
Wait a minute.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.499
- No, it's all here.
- Excuse me.

38:53.599 --> 38:56.769
A little over $500 in Swiss
Francs and travelers checks.

38:56.869 --> 38:58.637
Bunny isn't on your passport?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.928
No, she has her own.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.075
Why do you leave so much
money lying around?

39:03.175 --> 39:05.177
I was supposed to go to
Switzerland tomorrow...

39:05.277 --> 39:07.613
to cover the International
Monetary Conference...

39:07.713 --> 39:10.449
- You work for an American newspaper?
- No, magazines.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.819
He's in charge of the London office.
What's this got to do with Bunny?

39:13.919 --> 39:17.122
- I'm temporarily in charge.
- What did you do this morning, Mr. Lake?

39:17.222 --> 39:20.392
- After I left with Bunny?
- Yes, what did you do? Everything, please.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.493
let's see.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.462
I waited at Frogmore End
for the moving men.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.230
- Where?
- Frogmore End.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.199
It's a house where my boss lives.

39:27.299 --> 39:31.303
He's on a leave of absence right now doing
a job for the U.S. Information Agency.

39:31.403 --> 39:35.174
I used to live with them as a paying guest,
and then when Ann and Bunny came...

39:35.274 --> 39:38.210
- we stayed there till we could move here.
- Five nights, I think.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.813
Four nights. Then we moved in here.

39:40.913 --> 39:45.049
- Why not move here right away?
- The flat wasn't ready until today.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.487
So I waited at Frogmore
End for the moving men.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.557
Then I went to the airport
to cover the arrival of...

39:51.657 --> 39:54.893
- How is all this helping Bunny?
- I don't know yet. Go on, Mr. Lake.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.929
- Then I went back to the office.
- Where?

39:57.029 --> 40:01.256
Grosvenor St. I stayed there until
my sister called me from the school.

40:01.366 --> 40:05.730
Very well. I'll telephone you the
moment we have anything to report.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.214
- Superintendent.
- Andrews knows what I want.

40:15.314 --> 40:18.642
You won't mind if they take
some pictures, fingerprints?

40:18.850 --> 40:23.987
I don't understand. I don't see
how a child can just disappear.

40:25.424 --> 40:28.923
Either you've been the victim
of a very eccentric burglar...

40:29.194 --> 40:30.918
- or...
- Or what?

40:31.463 --> 40:34.466
- ...the child's things never were here.
- I unpacked them myself.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.735
I remember. Now I want you
to try and remember...

40:36.835 --> 40:39.371
who else saw the child since
you came to England...

40:39.471 --> 40:41.106
apart from you and your brother?

40:41.206 --> 40:44.109
Just try to think of
anyone else who saw her.

40:44.209 --> 40:47.279
- Who saw Bunny?
- Will you think hard about that, please?

40:47.379 --> 40:49.274
Let me have a list.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.413
We'll find her, sir.

41:33.859 --> 41:37.392
Yes, and the bloke, too. Degenerate.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.131
What do you mean?

41:39.231 --> 41:42.668
Hangings a courtesy to that type.
Hangings a kindness.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.368
He's got two girls of his own, sir.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.973
That kid we found up Old Oak Common.

41:48.073 --> 41:51.510
The way we found her, I could have
strung that bloke up personally.

41:51.610 --> 41:55.547
They'll probably just hit him with
a bloody psychiatrists report...

41:55.647 --> 41:57.916
Come on, Charles. We have work to do.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.013
He takes it all personally.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.954
Good day, sir.
We'll be letting you know.

42:10.862 --> 42:15.362
Don't let it be that.
Please, God, don't.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.933
Don't let them hurt her like that.

42:27.279 --> 42:29.106
I'd rather she be dead.

42:40.192 --> 42:42.690
Don't. They always exaggerate.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.597
It's the only way they can
make their job seem important.

42:45.697 --> 42:48.767
I never dreamed it could
be anything like that.

42:48.867 --> 42:50.125
It isn't.

42:51.470 --> 42:53.297
That mans a policeman.

42:54.373 --> 42:56.141
He knows about these things.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.170
He's a dumb bastard.

42:58.543 --> 43:03.112
If you'll just listen to me, I'll show you
how it couldn't be anything like that.

43:03.648 --> 43:06.316
- How?
- Because all of her things are gone.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.755
But that doesn't prove anything.

43:09.855 --> 43:13.158
Of course it does.
If you're going to kill a child...

43:13.258 --> 43:17.329
you don't go to the trouble of getting
toys and clothes for it, do you?

43:17.429 --> 43:19.859
And a bib? And a mug?

43:20.232 --> 43:23.424
- No. That's true.
- They went farther than that.

43:23.935 --> 43:27.070
They came here and got
her own clothes and toys.

43:27.539 --> 43:28.899
Why?

43:29.007 --> 43:33.473
Because these people, whoever they are,
want Bunny to be happy and comfortable.

43:37.416 --> 43:39.083
Yes, I can see that.

43:40.552 --> 43:43.922
And if they want her to be happy,
that means they won't hurt her.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.450
Exactly.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.622
But who?

43:57.269 --> 43:59.596
That's what we've got to find out.

43:59.938 --> 44:04.438
But you're not going to be much help
if you go all to pieces like this.

44:05.177 --> 44:06.674
Sorry.

44:14.386 --> 44:16.952
- That superintendent...
- Newhouse?

44:19.157 --> 44:21.188
He asked me for a list.

44:21.827 --> 44:25.861
A list of all the people who have
seen Bunny since we got to England.

44:27.065 --> 44:28.834
Now, what does he need that for?

44:28.934 --> 44:30.897
- Suspects, I suppose.
- No.

44:31.303 --> 44:33.095
Steven...

44:33.905 --> 44:35.766
he sounded like...

44:36.208 --> 44:39.778
he wanted to make sure
there really was a Bunny.

44:39.878 --> 44:42.347
- Come on. Get a hold...
- If he doesn't believe...

44:42.447 --> 44:45.617
that Bunny was real, maybe they'll
just stop looking for her.

44:45.717 --> 44:48.750
They wouldn't, honey.
They couldn't take that risk.

44:49.988 --> 44:51.678
There is something.

44:52.390 --> 44:55.252
Something I bet the thief missed.

44:58.964 --> 45:01.997
Here it is. Right where I hid it.

45:02.167 --> 45:03.135
What is it?

45:03.235 --> 45:05.904
I bought it for Bunny.
It has candy inside.

45:06.004 --> 45:08.900
I hid it there, so we
could play Hot and Cold.

45:09.274 --> 45:10.642
I'll take it to him.

45:10.742 --> 45:12.944
And I want somebody
to look at the house.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.580
It's empty, locked.
You'll have to get in somehow.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.542
Number 30 Frogmore End.
Have you got that?

45:19.184 --> 45:22.080
- <i>Yes, sir, 30 Frogmore End.</i>
- Okay.

45:39.004 --> 45:41.173
Steven, I just remembered.

45:41.273 --> 45:44.309
Tell him at least 30 people
saw her. Maybe more.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.412
- What do you mean?
- Everybody on the bus we took to school.

45:47.512 --> 45:50.340
Of course. I'll tell him.

45:56.488 --> 45:59.925
Of course I've seen children
disappear from this school.

46:00.025 --> 46:03.592
I've known children come for one
day and never return again.

46:03.695 --> 46:06.331
It's perfectly feasible,
Superintendent.

46:06.431 --> 46:09.167
Children are at the
mercy of their parents.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.527
And, for the most part,
parents are a very bad lot.

46:12.637 --> 46:15.040
In some instances,
even undeserving of their children.

46:15.140 --> 46:17.900
- Wouldn't you say?
- But I wouldn't say.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.868
That would make me
a suspect, don't you see?

46:20.979 --> 46:24.842
Queer old party saves child
from undeserving parent.

46:26.318 --> 46:28.587
Now, coming back to Bunny Lake.

46:28.687 --> 46:31.423
That's not her real name, you know.

46:31.523 --> 46:33.782
Not Bunny at all, but Felicia.

46:34.159 --> 46:38.625
Isn't it delicious? A little
affected for an American child...

46:39.130 --> 46:42.128
but I think it shows a
strong imagination at work.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.025
The brother told me quite a lot.

46:45.437 --> 46:48.333
There's something unusual
about that young man.

46:48.907 --> 46:51.337
Something very unusual.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.979
What exactly did Mr. Lake say to you?

46:54.079 --> 46:57.806
Apparently, she had this
completely imaginary companion.

46:58.016 --> 47:01.583
- Who, Bunny?
- No, the mother, when she was a child.

47:02.087 --> 47:04.155
And she called her Bunny.

47:04.255 --> 47:06.892
It's terribly common
among children...

47:06.992 --> 47:08.827
lonely children, that is.

47:08.927 --> 47:13.223
Why do you think Steven
Lake told you all this?

47:13.798 --> 47:16.167
let's say we took a
fancy to each other.

47:16.267 --> 47:19.638
The whole place was full of those
great men of yours in boots.

47:19.738 --> 47:22.774
I think we both knew that
was no way to find Bunny.

47:22.874 --> 47:25.677
- Why do you say that?
- Perhaps I'm wrong.

47:25.777 --> 47:28.639
I'm alone a great deal,
Superintendent.

47:29.114 --> 47:33.478
But that young man is worried about
his sister. Desperately worried.

47:33.818 --> 47:37.886
- Isn't that natural?
- Is it? Natural, I mean?

47:38.256 --> 47:41.823
I should have thought the natural
thing was to worry about the child.

47:55.340 --> 47:58.304
Johnson and Bates,
take a look upstairs.

48:17.796 --> 48:19.598
How long do they
go back, these records?

48:19.698 --> 48:23.561
I've kept them ever since I came.
Ever since Miss Ford retired.

48:23.968 --> 48:27.272
The parent fills out the entry
form and returns it with the fees.

48:27.372 --> 48:28.773
Just the first months.

48:28.873 --> 48:32.110
Then the child's name is put on a
card which records its progress...

48:32.210 --> 48:35.080
health, absences,
dental treatment, and conduct.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.948
And the ledger?

48:37.048 --> 48:39.818
Every penny received
over the last 12 months.

48:39.918 --> 48:43.110
Mr. Newhouse, I think
this might interest you.

48:43.388 --> 48:45.657
My sister bought it
this morning for Bunny.

48:45.757 --> 48:46.992
What time did she buy it?

48:47.092 --> 48:49.661
Before the child was missing,
if that's what you mean.

48:49.761 --> 48:51.763
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean, Mr. Lake.

48:51.863 --> 48:54.699
It would have been more useful
if it had turned up earlier.

48:54.799 --> 48:58.236
She hid it for a game of Hot and Cold
and forgot all about it until now.

48:58.336 --> 49:01.334
- Hot and Cold?
- It's a sort of treasure hunt.

49:01.439 --> 49:05.243
Ann and I used to play when we were little.
Now she plays it with Bunny.

49:05.343 --> 49:08.913
Odd how the most improbable things
suddenly seem quite reasonable.

49:09.013 --> 49:13.741
Then you'd agree with me she'd scarcely
buy playthings for a nonexistent child?

49:14.619 --> 49:17.188
Nonexistent? Did I say that?

49:17.288 --> 49:20.792
You suggested to her perhaps Bunny's
things were never in the apartment.

49:20.892 --> 49:24.295
You also asked her for a list of
everyone who had seen the child.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.697
Yes, I did want that.

49:25.797 --> 49:29.467
Then find the conductor and passengers
on the 13 bus that left Frogmore End...

49:29.567 --> 49:31.036
around 9:15 this morning...

49:31.136 --> 49:34.305
and stopped at Finchley Road tube
station and let Ann and Bunny off.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.942
Passengers are difficult to trace,
and bus conductors are rarely observant.

49:38.042 --> 49:41.179
They tend to be dreamers,
philosophers, that sort of thing.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.547
Self-protection, I suppose.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.315
You're not going to check it out?

49:44.415 --> 49:46.918
We have checked every bus
that passed Frogmore End...

49:47.018 --> 49:49.621
between 8:45 and 9:30 this morning.

49:49.721 --> 49:54.225
The fact that none of the conductors can
recall our mother and child is not unusual.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.929
Neither does it invalidate your sisters
statement that she was on board.

49:58.029 --> 50:01.366
However, I think we've found
something of greater importance...

50:01.466 --> 50:03.600
- and I'd like your views on it.
- Well?

50:03.701 --> 50:07.305
We've been through all the records of
every child entered for this nursery...

50:07.405 --> 50:09.040
during this past year.

50:09.140 --> 50:13.572
We've also been through the receipt
for all checks paid for fees in advance.

50:14.112 --> 50:17.213
Were Bunny's fees
paid for in advance?

50:17.348 --> 50:18.883
Yes, for the first month.

50:18.983 --> 50:20.912
- In currency?
- No, a check.

50:21.085 --> 50:23.455
And the entrance form,
was that sent back?

50:23.555 --> 50:26.491
- Yes, I mailed it in with the check.
- You did?

50:26.591 --> 50:28.393
My sister was still in America.

50:28.493 --> 50:29.928
- Besides, I...
- Besides?

50:30.028 --> 50:32.753
I always take care of
these things for her.

50:33.765 --> 50:36.134
Can you give us any idea
of when it was sent?

50:36.234 --> 50:38.561
I can give you more than an idea.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.740
Here it is: Little Peoples Garden.
L9 and nine shillings.

50:47.846 --> 50:50.715
Sent two weeks ago. Satisfied?

50:50.815 --> 50:54.819
I'm afraid, Mr. Lake, there's no record
of that ever having been received.

50:54.919 --> 50:56.821
The child's name is
nowhere in our records.

50:56.921 --> 51:00.488
What a convenient discovery.
Just at the right time, too.

51:01.359 --> 51:04.229
I take back what I said
this afternoon, Miss Smollett.

51:04.329 --> 51:06.497
Your track records looking up.

51:06.698 --> 51:08.933
You are all in the clear
no matter what happens...

51:09.033 --> 51:11.369
because you don't have Bunny's
name in your records.

51:11.469 --> 51:13.505
She's not in your index,
so she doesn't exist.

51:13.605 --> 51:14.939
What are you suggesting?

51:15.039 --> 51:18.409
You tore up the card and changed
the ledgers when there was trouble.

51:18.509 --> 51:21.045
- Superintendent, you don't believe...
- It is possible.

51:21.145 --> 51:23.848
Look, either the school
is lying or we are.

51:23.948 --> 51:25.884
They have a reason to.
They lost a child.

51:25.984 --> 51:29.312
But what possible reason would
my sister have for lying?

51:30.755 --> 51:33.583
I was hoping you could
give me a reason.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.731
You know that teachers lying.
She has to admit it.

51:39.831 --> 51:42.467
What do you suggest?
We no longer have the rack.

51:42.567 --> 51:45.503
You don't seem to be taking
this thing very seriously.

51:45.603 --> 51:46.604
I assure you that I am.

51:46.704 --> 51:49.407
It's very easy to tear out
an incriminating page...

51:49.507 --> 51:52.210
from a loose-leaf ledger.
You said so yourself.

51:52.310 --> 51:57.081
No, I didn't. By the same token, it's
possible to tear out a blank check form...

51:57.181 --> 51:59.117
and write anything
you like on the stub.

51:59.217 --> 52:01.653
If that's what you think,
ask the bank about it.

52:01.753 --> 52:04.856
I may, but you could just say
the school never deposited it...

52:04.956 --> 52:07.225
and they tore it up along
with the application.

52:07.325 --> 52:09.652
Are you calling me a liar?

52:09.827 --> 52:13.053
I'm not calling anybody
anything, Mr. Lake. Not yet.

52:13.231 --> 52:17.669
One thing I can guarantee: If this child
isn't found by tomorrow morning...

52:17.769 --> 52:20.563
I'll stir up the damnedest
mess you ever saw.

52:20.939 --> 52:21.906
How?

52:22.006 --> 52:24.275
By simply doing my
job as a journalist.

52:24.375 --> 52:27.045
American child disappears
in broad daylight...

52:27.145 --> 52:28.546
right in the middle of London.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.448
Police do nothing.
That sort of thing.

52:30.548 --> 52:32.750
Sounds conventional. A bit dull, too.

52:32.850 --> 52:36.821
It won't be dull for you.
I'll go to the American ambassador.

52:36.921 --> 52:38.256
I'll hire detectives.

52:38.356 --> 52:41.626
Yes. You'll hire. You'll complain.
That would be normal procedure.

52:41.726 --> 52:43.795
You do everything for
your sister, don't you?

52:43.895 --> 52:45.964
Pay her bills, fill up her forms...

52:46.064 --> 52:48.867
hire detectives to solve
her little mysteries.

52:48.967 --> 52:50.368
What's wrong with that?

52:50.468 --> 52:53.034
- How did she get to England?
- She?

52:53.538 --> 52:58.004
I'm sorry, they. How did your sister
and Bunny travel from America?

52:58.176 --> 52:59.866
- By ship.
- What ship?

53:00.044 --> 53:03.077
The <i>Queen Mary.</i> They arrived last Thursday.

53:05.583 --> 53:09.810
Tell me about you and your
sister when you were children.

53:29.507 --> 53:31.402
What are you doing here?

53:31.576 --> 53:34.904
Carrying out my landlords
right of inspection.

53:35.046 --> 53:38.683
The police were here.
I don't care for the police.

53:38.783 --> 53:42.510
My little girl, she's lost.
They're trying to find her.

53:43.454 --> 53:45.246
Your little girl?

53:45.723 --> 53:49.586
Mr. Lake, I understood,
had a little girl. A little sister.

53:50.094 --> 53:52.694
And that, duchess,
turned out to be you.

53:52.830 --> 53:55.294
But your having a little girl...

53:55.633 --> 53:58.825
that comes to me as a
most unwelcome surprise.

53:59.771 --> 54:02.701
No cage birds, I stipulated. No cats.

54:04.108 --> 54:06.572
No livestock of any kind.

54:06.778 --> 54:08.947
Somebody got in here and stole her things.

54:09.047 --> 54:11.147
Somebody took Bunny's things.

54:11.315 --> 54:13.284
- Bunny?
- Did you see anyone?

54:13.384 --> 54:15.711
They came up here while I was out.

54:18.089 --> 54:19.958
What sort of a name is that?

54:20.058 --> 54:23.861
Bunny rabbits, with those
long, mean heads...

54:23.961 --> 54:27.028
and those wet noses going
up and down all the time.

54:27.565 --> 54:29.867
Just who is this Bunny?

54:29.967 --> 54:33.364
How can you make jokes
when I told you she's lost?

54:33.905 --> 54:36.300
Bunny is my little girls name.

54:36.941 --> 54:40.770
And you, little duchess,
what exactly does that make you?

54:41.179 --> 54:42.937
I'm Bunny's mother.

54:43.548 --> 54:46.985
And I'm expecting a phone call
from the police and my brother.

54:47.085 --> 54:49.087
Probably my brother first.

54:49.187 --> 54:53.619
The telephone, that miracle
of modern communication.

54:54.225 --> 54:55.893
I often wonder why it is...

54:55.993 --> 55:00.198
that we communicate so much less with
all these marvels at our disposal...

55:00.298 --> 55:04.696
than we did in a more primitive day,
without the wireless and the television.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.430
I appear on the television, you know.

55:09.073 --> 55:12.674
They pay me to make use
of my melodious voice.

55:13.544 --> 55:17.043
I sing rude old Welsh ballads.

55:17.248 --> 55:19.746
I recite a few things of my own...

55:19.984 --> 55:22.420
and then I give them
Elizabethan drama.

55:22.520 --> 55:25.056
And all in exchange
for one whiskey...

55:25.156 --> 55:27.517
served to me in the first aid room.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.425
I could, if you like...

55:31.762 --> 55:34.123
give you a private performance.

55:34.332 --> 55:37.057
Please, just go away.

55:37.368 --> 55:40.401
I'm told that my voice...

55:41.472 --> 55:43.936
is extremely seductive.

55:44.509 --> 55:47.111
It seems to unleash whole
hurricanes of passion...

55:47.211 --> 55:50.608
in the breasts of the females
who watch me on the BBC.

55:53.684 --> 55:56.478
Perhaps you should sample the wine...

55:57.288 --> 56:00.150
before sending the bottle
back to the cellar.

56:01.893 --> 56:03.822
Anyone else in the family?

56:03.961 --> 56:05.651
No, except for Bunny.

56:06.864 --> 56:09.794
Of course. What about your parents?

56:11.068 --> 56:13.171
Our father was killed in the war.

56:13.271 --> 56:17.271
Went right up to V-E Day without a
scratch, and then got hit by a tank.

56:17.575 --> 56:19.037
One of ours.

56:20.344 --> 56:23.775
My mother, she was kind of peculiar.

56:24.482 --> 56:26.149
Any special way?

56:26.284 --> 56:28.386
She was a great believer
in the hereafter.

56:28.486 --> 56:30.955
Do you believe in life
on another planet?

56:31.055 --> 56:34.258
Seems quite unbelievable enough
to me on this one, I think.

56:34.358 --> 56:37.662
Anyhow, Mother used to spend
most of her time in church...

56:37.762 --> 56:41.632
the Church of Christ the Spiritualist,
having long talks with my father.

56:41.732 --> 56:45.036
It's funny, he never had much to
say to her while he was alive.

56:45.136 --> 56:48.169
But once he was dead,
apparently he never shut up.

56:48.839 --> 56:52.702
Anyway, I sort of got into the
habit of taking care of Ann.

56:53.211 --> 56:54.479
She was my responsibility.

56:54.579 --> 56:56.681
A bit of a burden,
wasn't it, on a schoolboy?

56:56.781 --> 56:58.816
- I didn't think of it that way.
- Your mother?

56:58.916 --> 57:01.050
She died almost two years ago.

57:01.652 --> 57:04.582
- Any communications with her since?
- Not a peep.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.058
When you were at school,
wasn't Ann lonely?

57:07.158 --> 57:08.659
No more so than any other child.

57:08.759 --> 57:10.628
What did she do to fill in her days?

57:10.728 --> 57:14.031
Reading, I suppose.
Books, dolls, that sort of thing.

57:14.131 --> 57:17.300
- Alone?
- Most of the time. We lived in the country.

57:17.969 --> 57:20.865
Look, where's all this getting us?

57:21.038 --> 57:26.077
Children, lonely children,
often make up imaginary playmates.

57:26.177 --> 57:29.972
- Did your sister ever do anything like that?
- Not that I know of.

57:39.924 --> 57:42.160
I'm terribly sorry if we've
inconvenienced you...

57:42.260 --> 57:44.662
but we're just following
our instructions.

57:44.762 --> 57:46.130
You've made me miss my plane.

57:46.230 --> 57:50.468
We'll book you on another plane as soon
as you've answered a few questions.

57:50.568 --> 57:54.636
You mustn't be cross with me because
I betrayed your little secret.

57:54.839 --> 57:57.441
After all, I didn't
know it was a secret.

57:57.541 --> 58:01.472
- Perhaps if you had told me...
- What precisely was it he did tell you?

58:01.679 --> 58:06.450
He began by asking me if it were unusual
for a child to invent a playmate.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.719
- And is it?
- Quite the contrary.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.920
It's one of the most common
of childhood fantasies.

58:12.223 --> 58:15.415
I recall one case, quite <i>outré...</i>

58:15.660 --> 58:18.863
- but that's neither here nor there, is it?
- I'm afraid not.

58:18.963 --> 58:22.394
Then he told me his sister
had made up a child.

58:22.667 --> 58:24.769
He said when his sister
was 5 years old...

58:24.869 --> 58:28.630
she'd invented another little
girl who she named Bunny.

58:28.906 --> 58:33.277
And that after a time, she began to think
of this Bunny as being her own child...

58:33.377 --> 58:36.647
- not only a friend.
- Mr. Lake?

58:36.747 --> 58:39.650
She has a good memory,
except for one detail.

58:39.750 --> 58:43.321
- I wasn't talking about my sister.
- I never lie, Superintendent.

58:43.421 --> 58:46.057
That makes you a most
unusual woman, Miss Ford.

58:46.157 --> 58:49.627
- Did he say it was his sister?
- Not in so many words, perhaps...

58:49.727 --> 58:52.430
but we'd been talking
about his sister earlier.

58:52.530 --> 58:54.999
If it wasn't about Ann,
then why did you tell her...

58:55.099 --> 58:57.235
that the name of the
imaginary child was Bunny?

58:57.335 --> 59:01.005
I couldn't remember the real name,
so I used Bunny hypothetically.

59:01.105 --> 59:02.340
That's reasonable.

59:02.440 --> 59:07.178
It's not reasonable, and Mr. Lake
is a most frightful liar.

59:07.278 --> 59:08.246
I give up.

59:08.346 --> 59:10.915
What was your purpose in paying
Miss Ford a second visit?

59:11.015 --> 59:13.384
- To soften her up, to get her talking.
- Why?

59:13.484 --> 59:16.387
- I had a feeling that she knew something.
- What could I know?

59:16.487 --> 59:20.291
This room, this flat, have been
my whole world for years now.

59:20.391 --> 59:23.527
This room and this flat
are on top of this school.

59:23.627 --> 59:24.762
What are you implying?

59:24.862 --> 59:29.055
That she wants to prove an imaginary
child to get the school off the hook.

59:30.267 --> 59:34.767
You would do anything, almost anything,
to protect your sister, wouldn't you?

59:36.073 --> 59:38.173
What's that supposed to mean?

59:38.309 --> 59:40.244
If Bunny were a phantom...

59:40.344 --> 59:43.445
if your sister were delusionary,
would you admit it?

59:43.614 --> 59:45.679
I've had it, Newhouse.

59:45.950 --> 59:49.654
Just give me half an hour to square
things at the office, then I'll get busy.

59:49.754 --> 59:51.785
I'll find Bunny without you.

59:52.523 --> 59:56.523
You'll be lucky if they still let
you hand out parking tickets.

59:56.894 --> 01:00:01.554
If you won't come to the party, duchess,
the party must come to you. Have a drink.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.966
I give you golden whiskey,
Scottish wine.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.641
I give you a sight of some very
interesting African gentlemen...

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:13.102
whose heads shrunk in the wash.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:18.346
I give you dark diamonds
of Elizabethan poetry...

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:21.510
set in the velvet of
my melodious voice.

01:00:22.153 --> 01:00:25.456
And all you do is sit staring at
that small mechanical instrument.

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:26.824
Please go away.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:29.558
What is it, duchess? Are you cold?

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:34.287
Is that buttermilk flesh all frozen?

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.028
What, cold, my girl?

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:40.696
Some would be honored,
may I tell you that, by my touch?

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:45.297
There are those at the BBC
who bear, like medals...

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:49.675
bruises left by the
love of Horatio Wilson.

01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:53.876
Is that the patter of tiny feet...

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.980
or the great thumping
boots of a constable?

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:03.828
Nothing yet, I'm afraid.
Nothing definite.

01:01:03.928 --> 01:01:07.291
- It will increase your melancholy...
- Who are you?

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.201
No autographs, but you
may touch my garment.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.540
Andrews, take Mr. Wilson
back to his flat, will you?

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.409
Is this where we get police violence?

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:21.178
Go with Andrews, please.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:24.140
All right. I was just about to go.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:26.349
Good night, duchess.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:33.855
Sorry that drunk pestered you.
Ever heard him read poetry?

01:01:34.225 --> 01:01:36.293
It's like a Welsh parson
gargling in molasses.

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.695
Where's Steven?

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:41.897
He had to get back to his office
for a little while. He won't be long.

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:46.966
- Looks as if you have a starved mouse.
- I tried to eat, but it made me sick.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.008
If you don't eat,
you'll just collapse.

01:01:51.108 --> 01:01:54.141
That won't help Bunny, will it?
Come along.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:01.652
The poor nuns used to lash each other...

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:05.115
into positive frenzies
of self-mortification.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:09.990
For myself, I find the sensation
rather more titillating...

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.194
if you'd care to have a bash.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:16.131
- No, thank you.
- No, I can't say I blame you.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.570
Hardly what one would
call a proper whip, is it?

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.770
More like a plaything.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.464
But this one...

01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:27.776
You simply must try this one.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.749
It's my particular pet.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:36.418
It's reputed to have belonged
to the great one himself:

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.779
The Marquis de Sade.

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:45.724
I have his skull here.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.963
At least, that's what they told
me in the Caledonian market.

01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:54.702
But there's nothing
like his very own whip.

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:58.872
So lovely. So very lovely.

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:17.895
One ham and one cheese sandwich,
and a large brandy and soda.

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:19.355
Yes, sir.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.499
Couldn't see anything in his flat...

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:25.569
but he could have taken the little
girls things any time this morning.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.873
- Why should he, I wonder?
- Bloody pervert, if you want my opinion.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:30.741
Kept on asking Rogers to strike him.

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:34.678
Please, Andrews, he works
for the BBC. While we're here...

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.914
go through the lake
flat again, will you?

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:39.774
See if anythings changed
since this morning.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:45.756
<i>Several hundred American
troops in West Germany...</i>

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:48.626
<i>in full Battle kit, moved up
this morning to Helmstedt...</i>

01:03:48.726 --> 01:03:51.724
<i>the control point of the
autobahn to Berlin.</i>

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.328
You're trying to tell
me something terrible?

01:03:55.429 --> 01:03:59.158
- Why?
- I don't know. You're being so nice.

01:04:01.472 --> 01:04:04.573
- I tried to make out that list.
- List?

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:08.878
- The people who'd seen Bunny.
- Yes, the list.

01:04:10.648 --> 01:04:12.583
There isn't anyone special.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.085
Just the people on the
bus this morning...

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.785
or at Southampton when
we got off the boat.

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:19.588
I see.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:23.656
She had a cold. I kept her indoors.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:30.534
I did find something I bought
for Bunny this morning.

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:33.370
- Did Steven give it to you?
- Yes, he showed me.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:37.265
Why don't you do something?
Why don't you find her?

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:41.006
<i>We repeat, and ask our viewers
to pay special attention...</i>

01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:43.080
No stone, as they say, unturned.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.182
<i>The search for the child
who disappeared...</i>

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:48.085
<i>from a Hampstead nursery
school this morning continues.</i>

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:51.355
<i>The police say that the child is
fair-haired, about 3 feet high...</i>

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:52.815
<i>is wearing...</i>

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.964
Ever been in a pub before?

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:09.062
No.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:15.545
Here it is, the heart
of merry old England.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.283
Complete with dirty glasses,
watery beer...

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:23.178
drafts under the doors,
and a 23-inch television.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.285
Have you been out much
since you arrived?

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.696
Steven was looking forward
to showing me the sights...

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:34.930
but Bunny had that cold.

01:05:35.199 --> 01:05:38.402
But surely you could have found
someone to babysit for you.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:41.227
Steven thought so, too, but I didn't.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.907
She was in a strange house
in a strange country.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.903
A strange babysitter might
have been too much.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.880
You and your brother are
pretty close, aren't you?

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.704
All of our lives.

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:55.374
I've been meaning to ask you...

01:05:55.753 --> 01:05:58.547
did anyone try to stop
you having your baby?

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.614
You mean an abortion?

01:06:00.758 --> 01:06:03.727
Steven offered to arrange
one for me if I wanted it.

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:07.019
I suppose it seemed the most
practical thing to do...

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.333
but I decided against it.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:12.067
- What about the father?
- My father?

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:14.001
Bunny's father.

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:18.802
He was just a boy I
went to school with...

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:22.109
or sometimes to a movie or a dance.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.882
He wasn't really very
important to me.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:28.345
How did he take the news of
Bunny's impending arrival?

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:33.078
He came to the house and
he offered to marry me...

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.524
but Steven threw him out.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.327
And that somewhat dampened his ardor?

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:41.529
No, he was still willing.
I was the one who said no.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:45.133
- Why?
- I wasn't in love with him.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.364
Steven said I'd already
made one mistake.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.298
Why complicate it with a second?

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:56.071
Your brother sounds like
a sensible young man.

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:58.242
Eat something, won't you?

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.684
- Yes, sir.
- Two brandies and soda, please.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:32.710
That's better.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.416
I'm not very good at drinking
on an empty stomach.

01:07:37.855 --> 01:07:41.855
Did you ever have an imaginary
friend when you were a child?

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:44.128
Did Steven tell you that?

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.828
In a way. What sort
of a friend was it?

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:51.864
A little girl. Didn't you ever have an
imaginary playmate when you were little?

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:57.174
I was raised amidst the strife and
tumult of nine male and female siblings.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:08:00.034
It would have been madness
to invent a tenth.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.976
Did Steven tell you
my playmates name?

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:06.450
- No, he didn't.
- Bunny. Does that seem odd to you?

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.354
Compared to most oddities that fall into
my professional lap, it's commonplace.

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:13.557
Bunny was the name of a character
in a child's storybook.

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:17.895
She was a lovely character, so I named
my playmate after the girl in the book.

01:08:17.995 --> 01:08:20.831
Then later, when my daughter
was born, I called her Bunny...

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.393
as a nickname.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.469
Isn't that what you're
really questioning me about?

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:29.206
I'm not questioning you, Miss Lake.
I'm just trying to know you better.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:32.600
What happened to the
Bunny in the storybook?

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:34.843
How did her story end?

01:08:36.647 --> 01:08:37.881
I can't remember.

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:41.309
Well, what happened to
the Bunny you invented?

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:45.988
When I began to outgrow her,
we decided it would be better if she died.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.158
- We?
- Steven and I.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:51.295
He had read about this
Buddhist funeral ceremony...

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:54.131
they have each year in
Japan for broken dolls.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:56.399
So we dug a grave in the garden...

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.002
and then we buried her after
burning all her things.

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:00.304
What things?

01:09:00.404 --> 01:09:03.801
The imaginary things an
imaginary child would need.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:09.179
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Newhouse?

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:12.249
While the Superintendent was
being so charming to you here...

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:14.984
his stooges have been
searching our apartment.

01:09:15.085 --> 01:09:16.587
I assume you have a search warrant?

01:09:16.687 --> 01:09:18.589
Are you making a complaint?

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:22.459
Why are you pouring liquor into my
sister when you know she's so upset?

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.428
Was he trying to brainwash you?

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:27.865
- No, Steven, of course not.
- What are you up to, Newhouse?

01:09:27.965 --> 01:09:29.765
Trying to find the truth.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:32.636
Isn't that what you were
looking for in our apartment?

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:35.138
I just want to find
one simple thing...

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:38.140
one small, simple proof.

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:40.877
- Proof of what?
- That Bunny Lake exists.

01:09:40.978 --> 01:09:42.406
You son of a...

01:09:44.715 --> 01:09:46.176
Let him go.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.484
We're not supposed
to hit you, Mr. Lake.

01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:51.787
In return, I must ask you not to hit me.
It doesn't prove anything.

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.579
Mr. Newhouse, what are
you going to do now?

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.186
Go home.

01:10:05.836 --> 01:10:08.872
That's all, Superintendent.
Shall I keep her here...

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.307
<i>until you return?</i>

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:14.134
No, it all adds up. Compliment her
on her junket and let her go.

01:10:14.745 --> 01:10:18.482
I'd like to talk to Supt. Newhouse,
please. This is Ann Lake.

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:19.883
<i>Is it about your little girl?</i>

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:24.254
Of course it's about my little girl.
What else would I be calling him about?

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:27.887
<i>The Superintendents not here.
I'm afraid he's gone home.</i>

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:33.391
Ann, bring me another cigarette,
will you? They're in my coat pocket.

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:49.168
He did it. They said he'd gone home.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.909
We'll find her ourselves.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:56.720
I made an appointment with the best
private detective in London...

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.622
first thing in the morning.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.753
By morning, she may be dead.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:04.319
Ann, stop it.
We've already been through that.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:09.161
The one thing that absolutely can't
happen is that Bunny will be found dead.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:12.302
Either she'll be found with
the people that took her...

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:16.231
or she won't be found at all.
That's the worst that could happen.

01:11:17.174 --> 01:11:20.275
We'd never see her again,
but we'd know she's alive.

01:11:21.078 --> 01:11:23.678
I'd rather die than
never see her again.

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:30.017
Listen to me. I was only
trying to comfort you.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.357
You said she might be dead,
and I wanted to show you...

01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:38.185
that even if we never see her again, she'll
still be alive with people who love her.

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:41.598
- How could they hide her so well?
- I don't think they have.

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:43.923
I think we're gonna find her.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:45.902
And the best thing
you can do to help...

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:48.605
is to take a sleeping pill
and get a good nights sleep.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:51.840
- I'll wait up for the phone.
- No, I don't want to.

01:11:56.379 --> 01:11:57.881
Steven, the doll!

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:00.150
- What doll?
- Bunny's doll.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:04.354
Here's the ticket from the repair shop.
You took it there yourself yesterday.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:06.246
I forgot all about it.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.694
- I'm gonna run right over there.
- It's too late. They'll be closed.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:14.157
I'll make them open up.
I'll break the door in.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:18.935
If the ticket and the doll is real,
then they'll have to believe Bunny's real.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:21.931
But nobody will be
there at this time.

01:12:22.139 --> 01:12:24.637
<i>Keep moving, please.</i>

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:27.166
<i>Keep on the pavement.</i>

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:30.638
<i>Don't walk in the street, please.</i>

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.419
Can't we take some other street?

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:37.921
They're all the same, ma'am.
It's the theater crowd.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:41.825
- How much further is it to King St.?
- In this mess, could take hours.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.161
- Could I walk it?
- Quicker than I can drive you.

01:12:44.261 --> 01:12:45.862
Tell me where it is.

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:48.995
Turn left, go about 200 yards,
then ask again.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.724
<i>Keep moving, please.</i>

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.709
- Is this all the passengers?
- The complete list.

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:02.245
- No stowaways?
- Not as far as we know.

01:13:02.345 --> 01:13:04.781
Did you expect to
find the child, sir?

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:08.685
It's not just the child. Neither of
them came. Neither one of them.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:11.354
You know what that means,
don't you, Andrews?

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:13.815
You and I made them up.

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:18.023
We made up the whole family.
Go and ring the Lakes flat.

01:13:37.214 --> 01:13:40.250
Hello, my dear. What about
a little drink and a dance?

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:42.074
You do dance, don't you?

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.315
No reply, sir, from the Lakes flat.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:51.191
Four nights.

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:59.503
Four or five nights.
She said five. He said four.

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:02.839
- If it was five, they'd have come on...
- Wednesday.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.942
Yes. Did any of your boats arrive
on Wednesday of last week?

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.110
Not ours, definitely.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.743
Well, what did? Something must
have crossed the Atlantic.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.456
- Well?
- From New York?

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.155
From America.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.194
The <i>Bremen,</i> bound for Bremerhaven...

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:27.063
arrived Southampton,
Wednesday, 2:30 p.m.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:29.332
- Can you get me a passenger list?
- Tonight?

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:31.896
No, I don't mean tonight.
I mean, now.

01:15:05.302 --> 01:15:08.130
Come up. I've almost finished it.

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:17.807
- Good evening.
- Come in, my dear.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.751
I thought it was someone else.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.653
Yes, I've got a near fatality here...

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:27.524
and I told the char to leave the
door unfastened for its mother...

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.426
who lives next door.

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:32.395
She's only 6 years old, you see.

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:36.392
And at that age, they're always
alarmists about their children.

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.402
But you look pale. Are you all right?

01:15:42.072 --> 01:15:43.506
Can I get you some tea?

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:46.376
No, thank you. I'm quite all right.
I was just...

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:48.645
My brother left a doll
here to be repaired...

01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:51.615
and I need it so I can prove
that I really have a...

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:53.644
Here's the receipt.

01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:01.456
Yes, I remember.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:05.854
This doll had almost
been loved to death.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:09.165
You know, love inflicts the
most terrible injuries...

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.034
on my small patients.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:13.903
I'm afraid you'll have
to find it yourself.

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:16.406
My helper has gone home.

01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:19.075
There's a basement...

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:23.141
underneath the room you entered by.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.649
I call it the recuperation ward.

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:31.277
You'll find it there.
I'll just light this lamp for you.

01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:33.522
There now.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.625
That's it.

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:40.752
Thank you very much.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:12.055
Look, I found her. Now we can take her
to the police. They'll have to believe us.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.591
Yes, I guess they will.
Come on, the cars outside.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:17.086
No, wait. I have to pay the old man.

01:18:22.432 --> 01:18:24.429
<i>Mommy.</i>

01:18:57.033 --> 01:18:59.098
Steven, what are you doing?

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.333
No, sir, both out.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:34.933
By the looks of it, they left in a hurry,
too. All the lights are still burning.

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:42.545
Other than this slight contusion,
there's nothing that shows up yet.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:44.914
She must have hit her
head when she fell.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:47.817
I found her just lying there
in front of the fireplace.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:50.787
She'd been under a terrible
strain the last couple of days.

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:53.423
let's not wake her.
Sleeps the best medicine right now.

01:19:53.523 --> 01:19:56.292
But she'll wake up soon.
She's always been a light sleeper.

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:59.295
If that happens, we'll give
her something. She needs to sleep.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.130
It'll give her a chance to unwind.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.733
Tomorrow, when she's had
a rest, we can run some tests.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:08.629
I don't care how long it takes or how much
it costs. I want her to get completely well.

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:13.610
The last couple of weeks, it was as if I
had lost touch with her and she with me.

01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:16.846
She kept going on about
an imaginary child...

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:19.249
she thought was lost or something.

01:20:19.349 --> 01:20:21.851
Perhaps I ought to
consult a psychiatrist.

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:25.421
Perhaps. In the meantime,
Mr. Lake, we'll do all we can.

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.324
And if we should need to get
in touch with you later...

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:32.095
- can we call you at home?
- Yes, but I won't be there till very late.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:35.023
This whole thing has
played havoc with my job.

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.537
<i>Dr. Avery, please.</i>

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:20.743
- The doctor ordered sedation if needed.
- Thank you.

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:23.170
- Bed Number 2.
- Right.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.723
- Mrs. Robertson is getting restless.
- Go change her dressing, Nurse.

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.792
Will you bring the trolley?

01:22:42.892 --> 01:22:45.185
Then I'll call Dr. Sheldon.

01:22:45.595 --> 01:22:47.964
- Everything is ready.
- Thank you.

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:51.401
So then, what's all this about,
Mrs. Robertson?

01:22:51.501 --> 01:22:55.159
We're going to do your dressing again,
and you'll be quite comfortable.

01:22:59.242 --> 01:23:01.205
Just lie quietly.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:32.628
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Get me the gate.

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:36.132
- <i>Main gate.</i>
- A patient left Ward C4 without permission.

01:25:36.232 --> 01:25:38.798
Stop her at the gate. I'll come down.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:32.315
Routine report just came through
from St. Charles Hospital in Hampstead.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:34.784
A young woman seems to have escaped.

01:27:34.884 --> 01:27:36.449
Her name is Lake.

01:33:03.979 --> 01:33:06.841
That was very smart
of Stevie, wasn't it?

01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:10.452
- What?
- The way he got her out of the school.

01:33:10.552 --> 01:33:14.210
He was there before you were.
He was watching you all the time.

01:33:14.323 --> 01:33:15.858
Then when I left, he took her.

01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:17.760
He had to be very fast.

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:20.663
He knew he didn't have much
time before recess began.

01:33:20.763 --> 01:33:22.364
That was brave of him.

01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:26.302
I would have been frightened.
Where did he hide her?

01:33:26.402 --> 01:33:29.305
He put her to sleep and hid
her in the trunk of his car.

01:33:29.405 --> 01:33:33.542
That was the smartest thing of all.
He knew they'd never look there.

01:33:33.642 --> 01:33:34.710
Of course not.

01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:39.174
But he knew they'd look here.
He even reminded them to, and they did.

01:33:39.882 --> 01:33:41.777
Now he's perfectly safe.

01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:44.146
They'll never come back.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.117
Only, you shouldn't be here.
He didn't want you here.

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:52.256
- But I came.
- Why?

01:33:53.562 --> 01:33:56.595
I wanted to be with you, Stevie...

01:33:57.232 --> 01:34:00.799
so that no one would frighten you...

01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.169
or hurt you...

01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:05.731
or make you cry.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:09.606
- I didn't do anything wrong, did I?
- Of course not.

01:34:10.879 --> 01:34:12.307
But you did.

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:15.373
You did wrong, Annie.

01:34:16.251 --> 01:34:18.146
You forgot about me.

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:21.715
All you could think
of was that boy...

01:34:22.524 --> 01:34:24.624
that dirty, rotten boy.

01:34:25.461 --> 01:34:27.390
That was wrong, wasn't it?

01:34:27.863 --> 01:34:30.766
Yes, Stevie, that was very wrong.

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:33.135
And then you let her grow inside you.

01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:36.097
You didn't have to do that,
but you did.

01:34:37.072 --> 01:34:39.536
And now we can't be together anymore.

01:34:39.942 --> 01:34:42.303
She's always there between us.

01:34:42.845 --> 01:34:45.513
No one will ever come
between us, Stevie.

01:34:45.714 --> 01:34:48.041
We'll always be together.

01:34:48.517 --> 01:34:51.686
- I'm sorry I burned that doll.
- It was just a doll.

01:34:52.154 --> 01:34:54.356
- I didn't care.
- I knew you wouldn't.

01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:56.892
That other Bunny came
between us, too, didn't she?

01:34:56.992 --> 01:35:00.457
Not really. She was
only make-believe.

01:35:00.896 --> 01:35:02.723
Mommy.

01:35:05.534 --> 01:35:07.827
But she did come between us.

01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:10.900
That's why she had to
die and go to heaven.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.599
No, don't. I'll do it, Stevie.
Let me do it.

01:35:18.981 --> 01:35:20.443
No, Annie.

01:35:21.717 --> 01:35:24.442
You don't like me the best anymore.

01:35:25.587 --> 01:35:27.311
You like her.

01:35:28.657 --> 01:35:31.018
You whisper to her at night.

01:35:31.793 --> 01:35:34.962
You tell her secrets
that you won't tell me.

01:35:35.364 --> 01:35:36.963
I can't trust you.

01:35:38.033 --> 01:35:40.599
Of course you can, Stevie.

01:35:41.336 --> 01:35:42.628
I promise.

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:45.839
It isn't fair.

01:35:47.609 --> 01:35:50.710
When the make-believe
Bunny came between us...

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.971
you made her die and go to heaven.

01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:55.976
Now it's my turn.

01:36:09.364 --> 01:36:12.829
Stevie, I'm tired of this game.

01:36:13.268 --> 01:36:15.368
I want to play hide-and-seek.

01:36:16.138 --> 01:36:18.340
- I bet I beat you.
- I bet you don't.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.275
I thought it up, so you're it.

01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:23.669
- Now hide your face and count, Stevie.
- All right.

01:36:24.146 --> 01:36:26.837
But I'll catch you.
Just you wait and see.

01:36:27.215 --> 01:36:30.441
One, two, three, four...

01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:09.124
- I won!
- Not until the game is finished.

01:37:09.224 --> 01:37:11.289
You haven't tagged me yet.

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:43.392
<i>Here we go round the mulberry Bush
The mulberry Bush, the mulberry Bush</i>

01:37:43.492 --> 01:37:47.822
<i>Here we go round the mulberry Bush
On a cold and frosty morning</i>

01:38:06.515 --> 01:38:10.752
<i>This is the way we jump up and down
Jump up and down, jump up and down</i>

01:38:10.852 --> 01:38:14.283
<i>This is the way we jump up and down
Jump up and down</i>

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:22.692
<i>This is the way we jump up and down
On a cold and frosty morning</i>

01:38:25.667 --> 01:38:27.869
Hey, let's play blind mans bluff!

01:38:27.969 --> 01:38:29.534
Yes, let's!

01:38:50.058 --> 01:38:52.351
Here I come, ready or not.

01:39:19.354 --> 01:39:21.419
- I won!
- Now it's my turn.

01:41:01.423 --> 01:41:04.251
Darling, move in here...

01:41:04.759 --> 01:41:07.395
and sit down very quietly.

01:41:07.495 --> 01:41:10.232
Don't move till Mommy gets back.
Promise me.

01:41:10.332 --> 01:41:12.227
- Promise.
- All right.

01:41:48.737 --> 01:41:50.928
Please don't. Don't.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.398
You cheated.

01:41:53.675 --> 01:41:56.469
Steven, you don't mean it.

01:41:56.711 --> 01:41:59.607
You can't possibly be serious.

01:42:00.882 --> 01:42:02.709
You love Bunny, too.

01:42:04.452 --> 01:42:07.280
We can all be happy,
all three of us together.

01:42:09.591 --> 01:42:11.315
Steven, don't.

01:42:12.127 --> 01:42:14.386
Please give her to me, Steven.

01:42:19.167 --> 01:42:22.894
Steven, you're sick.
You're mad, Steven! Sick!

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:26.970
Please, Steven.

01:42:28.410 --> 01:42:30.635
Steven, give her to me, please.

01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.914
Steven, give her to me.

01:42:37.552 --> 01:42:39.276
Please, Steven.

01:42:39.988 --> 01:42:41.485
Give her to me.

01:42:43.825 --> 01:42:45.583
Steven, please.

01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:09.851
Stevie, come here.

01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:13.882
I want to go high, Stevie,
and I can't go high without you.

01:43:14.022 --> 01:43:15.624
Come here.

01:43:15.724 --> 01:43:17.192
Come here right now...

01:43:17.292 --> 01:43:20.950
or I won't play with you
anymore ever again.

01:43:32.741 --> 01:43:35.000
Annie needs to play with you.

01:43:51.459 --> 01:43:53.286
Push me, Stevie.

01:43:55.063 --> 01:43:57.197
I want to touch the sky.

01:43:59.267 --> 01:44:01.594
Up to the sky.

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:19.152
- Fly up to the sky!
- Up to the sky!

01:44:39.607 --> 01:44:41.434
- Higher!
- Higher!

01:44:48.683 --> 01:44:50.350
Higher and higher!

01:45:34.696 --> 01:45:38.400
You shouldn't have lied about the
boat they arrived on, Mr. Lake.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.225
Quite unnecessary and
sure to be found out.

01:45:43.104 --> 01:45:45.673
Rogers, you'll drive Miss
Lake home, won't you?

01:45:45.773 --> 01:45:47.201
Yes, sir.

01:45:55.016 --> 01:45:57.741
Sleep well, both of you...

01:45:59.587 --> 01:46:01.516
now that you exist.
