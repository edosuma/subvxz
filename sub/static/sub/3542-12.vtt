Who is in the lockbox?

He's been sired. He feels loyal to Klaus.
Klaus' blood created him.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.354
He released me from a curse
that was ruining my life.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.898
- I owe him for that.
- Bite your girlfriend.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.900
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.

your undying loyalty to the test.
