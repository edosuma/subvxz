Mike forgot to log out.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.110
"TGIF"? It's Wednesday.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.779
I know.
That's what makes it funny.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.448
-No. I don't feel
comfortable with this.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.786
Jeez, who are
all these people?

00:53.788 --> 00:57.222
Mike's not really friends

Good lord. And 83 "likes"?
Why would someone "like" this?

We have a new mystery.

Okay, team. Gather around.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.835
Hey, how come you never
go skinny dipping? Huh?

01:42.837 --> 01:45.871
-It's your house.
-Actually, I was
skinny dipping.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.673
Yeah, with some
of my girlfriends.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.908
I just put this bathing suit
on right before I walked in.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.378
It was super fun.
We were just out there,
splashing around,

01:53.380 --> 01:57.516
touching each other, giggling.
It was very erotic.
I'm sorry you missed it.

We got in real late last
night, and I left my wallet
in my other pants' pocket

04:37.411 --> 04:39.278
and we couldn't
get into the hotel room.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.180

Mmm. This is delicious,

my mouth around it.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.630

bigger things in that mouth.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.034
-What does that even mean?
-(BLEEP)!

05:02.036 --> 05:04.202

-(STAMMERS) It really is
all so delicious.

I'm telling you,
it's this location. There must
be something wrong with it.

I haven't sold a sandwich
since I moved in.

05:12.713 --> 05:17.115
You're not expecting us to pay
for this, are you? I mean,
this is research.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.584
Do you know anything about
the history of the building?

05:19.586 --> 05:24.056
No. Just that these buildings
along Newbury Street
are hundreds of years old.

05:24.058 --> 05:28.393
I know this sounds crazy,
but I swear sometimes
I can hear this

05:28.395 --> 05:30.529

05:31.464 --> 05:33.265
Whoa.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.100
Well, maybe we can
find something out at
the hall of records.

You guys go to the hall
of records while I ask around

05:37.471 --> 05:41.173

anything, you know?

-Do you want one of us
to go with you?
-(DOOR OPENS)

05:43.944 --> 05:46.945
We were all
in a car together
for 30 hours, Marquess.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.914
Why do you gotta be so clingy?

05:50.683 --> 05:53.952
What's the point of going
to the hall of records
when all they do

05:53.954 --> 05:55.654
is tell us to go
on the Internet?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.023
-Shh!
-I mean everything
we've done so far,

05:58.025 --> 06:00.092
we could have done from
our God (BLEEP) living room.

06:00.094 --> 06:03.128
-Shh!
-What are you shushing me for?
It's the hall of records,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.963
it's not a library.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.466
And I don't even know
why do you have to be quiet
in the library anymore.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.769
I mean, the only people
who go there now are
homeless guys looking at porno

06:10.771 --> 06:12.938
-and stuff like that...
-Oh, here we go.

06:12.940 --> 06:18.410
It was built in 1869 and was,
at the time, Boston's biggest
whale oil extractory.

06:18.412 --> 06:22.547
Oh, my. I lived near
one of those in London.
It was a foul place.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.384
<i>They would cut the blubber</i>
<i>off those poor dead whales</i>

06:25.386 --> 06:27.853
<i>and cook it in fats</i>
<i>to extract their oil.</i>

06:27.855 --> 06:31.456
Oh, and look at this. In 1880,
there was an oil fire

06:31.458 --> 06:33.792
and the building
was engulfed in flames.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.194

06:36.196 --> 06:39.264

-You cannot look
at pornography

on these computers.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.682
MARQUESS: You went shopping?

06:57.684 --> 07:00.552
I didn't just go shopping.
I also found out
no information.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.187
I thought you forgot
your wallet.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.289
That's what's so great
about being Mike Tyson.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.492
You take a couple of pictures
here, give them one
or two of these,

07:07.494 --> 07:09.628
give them one of those,

07:09.630 --> 07:12.564
and bang, bang, boom,
$600 loafers, buddy.

07:12.566 --> 07:16.701
-Well, they are undeniably
good-looking.
-Thank you, Pigeon.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.704
They hurt like (BLEEP),
but, you know,
you gotta suffer for fashion.

07:19.706 --> 07:23.575
Dad, we figured out why
no one will go in there.
The building really is cursed.

07:23.577 --> 07:28.180
Damn. Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should go
over there to Versace

07:28.182 --> 07:30.415
and see if I can find out
some more information.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.151
And get some pants, too,
to go with these loafers.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.621
Michael, we need to try
and lift the curse.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.590
Wait! What about your ex-wife?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.358
Who, Sandra?

07:40.360 --> 07:42.594
-She cursed you and turned you
into a pigeon, right?
-Yeah.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.863
(STAMMERS)
No. No, I'm not
calling Sandra.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.598
But she could be
our only hope.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.100
Yeah. Yeah, listen.
If I'm gonna ask
Sandra for a favor,

07:49.102 --> 07:51.303
it's gonna be to
turn me back into a man,

07:51.305 --> 07:54.906
not to help some dumb bitch
who makes sandwiches.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.910
Just seeing if you guys
were hungry.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.379
What about you, Marquess?
You're a ghost.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.682
-You're into voodoo and shit.
-No, I'm not.

08:03.684 --> 08:07.686
Yeah, but you're into, like,
um, you know, witchcraft,
and dark arts, right?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.721
-Aren't you?
-What? No.

08:09.723 --> 08:13.492
-Man, so you're just a ghost
that does nothing?
-Well, that's just hurtful.
