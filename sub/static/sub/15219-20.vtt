You're right!

41:21.435 --> 41:23.960
Oh! 7-2's my grandma's age,

41:24.037 --> 41:27.268
but I forgot to subtract
my age to get 42.

41:28.275 --> 41:31.244
You're 30?

41:31.311 --> 41:34.212
I thought you told me
you were 26.

41:34.281 --> 41:37.444
Well, okay, that was a fib.
I'm really 30.

41:37.518 --> 41:39.782
But if anyone asks, I'm 26, okay?

41:39.853 --> 41:41.844
[ Sighs ]

41:48.095 --> 41:51.155
About five more blocks, Sam,
on the right.
What about Reed?

41:51.231 --> 41:54.200
He's somewhere within a quarter of a mile.
You're right! He knows
the address! He'll find us!

41:56.270 --> 41:58.500
Hello. Hello, police! Police!

41:58.572 --> 42:00.836
We're kidnappers from Texas.
Arrest us!
Bunny, what are you doin'?

42:00.908 --> 42:03.741
We'll be at 423 2 Mesa Avenue.
Bunny--

42:03.811 --> 42:06.143
The police will come to Margaret's
house and arrest Reed.
<i>[ Radio Chatter ]</i>

42:06.213 --> 42:10.206

<i>Now, what in hell is goin'on here?</i>
<i>What's this about a kidnapping?</i>

He stole my child.

Everything's okay.

We gotta go downtown

44:02.329 --> 44:05.457
they've got a dozen
outstanding warrants against Reed.

44:05.532 --> 44:10.162
We gotta take care of Christy first,
'cause she needs a warm bottle
and a good night's sleep.

44:10.237 --> 44:13.229
What do you say we find a motel
and snuggle down for the night?

44:13.307 --> 44:17.403
Bunny, Christy's home.

44:17.477 --> 44:21.243
Tomorrow.
She can be home tomorrow.

I mean,just let us keep her
one more night.

She doesn't know how she
likes her oatmeal with little bits
of cheddar cheese in it...

44:44.404 --> 44:46.634
or how she--
[ Sobbing ]

44:46.707 --> 44:49.870
how she kicks off her covers
when you don't tuck her in...

44:49.943 --> 44:52.537
or how she'll crawl
across the floor to get to P.U.

44:52.613 --> 44:54.604
You can tell her.

I just can't.
