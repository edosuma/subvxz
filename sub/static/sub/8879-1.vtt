11:53.358 --> 11:55.847
Yeah. Well, she'll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

11:55.872 --> 11:57.501
Yeah, I'm not gonna disagree with you.

12:02.999 --> 12:06.083
So takeout
or raid your fridge?

12:08.798 --> 12:10.351
Here we go.

12:12.516 --> 12:14.037
Take it easy, Lilly.

12:14.581 --> 12:15.703
Easy.

12:23.765 --> 12:24.652
Hi.

12:25.767 --> 12:28.432
You never called me back so I figured
I'd bring the coffee to you.

12:29.628 --> 12:31.098
Thanks. Um...

12:31.474 --> 12:34.769
Look, I think you're a really nice guy
and everything, but...

12:34.794 --> 12:36.592
I don't know why
you called me.

12:36.617 --> 12:38.193
You know? I'm a woman.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.543
Yeah, I love that fact.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.134
Have you ever been
with a woman?

12:47.297 --> 12:48.547
Excuse me?

12:48.572 --> 12:50.534
I mean, have you only
ever been with men?

12:50.559 --> 12:52.117
Men?
What are you talking...

12:52.142 --> 12:54.894
Whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, I'm not gay.

12:54.919 --> 12:55.883
You're not?

12:55.908 --> 12:56.674
No.

12:56.699 --> 12:59.941
No, I like women.
Lots of... no, not lots of women,

12:59.966 --> 13:01.480
but you know what I mean.

13:02.128 --> 13:03.652
Why did you think
I was gay?

13:05.691 --> 13:06.801
Awkward.

13:06.826 --> 13:09.143
Okay, I got to go now.

13:09.168 --> 13:10.846
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

13:11.612 --> 13:13.050
Okay, I'll prove to you
that I'm not gay, okay?

13:13.075 --> 13:15.819
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We'll watch the playoffs,

13:15.844 --> 13:18.141
I'll order a pizza,
I'll completely ignore you.

13:20.577 --> 13:22.064
Give me one good reason.

13:24.177 --> 13:25.478
'Cause I'm different.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.932
Really?

13:28.907 --> 13:29.917
Okay, what color
are my eyes?

13:33.677 --> 13:36.415
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

13:37.068 --> 13:39.298
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

13:39.323 --> 13:42.893
And if you look really closely around the iris
the color is pure honey.

13:44.972 --> 13:47.975
But when you look
into the sun

13:48.000 --> 13:50.293
they almost look green.

13:50.318 --> 13:51.670
That's my favorite.

13:58.661 --> 13:59.899
How'd I do?

14:01.112 --> 14:02.997
I would've settled
for brown.

14:04.157 --> 14:04.752
Okay!

14:05.414 --> 14:06.227
Peanut, let go!

14:06.252 --> 14:07.378
Off! Off!

14:08.449 --> 14:10.082
I'm sorry he bit you.

14:10.585 --> 14:12.694
I mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.076
Seriously, don't worry about it.
(It) barely broke the skin.

14:15.101 --> 14:16.322
Outside.

14:16.347 --> 14:18.021
Did you just move
in or something?

14:18.046 --> 14:19.834
No, I've been here
a year and a half.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.661
Oh, nice place.

14:22.947 --> 14:25.102
I should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

14:25.535 --> 14:26.765
What is all this stuff?

14:27.320 --> 14:28.643
Oh, I'm a yoga instructor.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.549
This?

14:29.841 --> 14:31.533
And a Little League coach.

14:31.558 --> 14:33.055
And a dog walker
and a caterer.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.753
I told you I'm a temp.

14:34.778 --> 14:37.932
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

14:37.957 --> 14:38.400
Remy.

14:38.425 --> 14:39.399
I mean, look at her sketchbook.

14:39.424 --> 14:39.870
Remy!

14:39.895 --> 14:40.883
She hides it
right under there.

14:40.908 --> 14:41.725
Remy!

14:41.750 --> 14:42.475
What?

14:44.579 --> 14:45.520
The hell's he doing here?

14:45.545 --> 14:47.065
He's not gay.

14:47.089 --> 14:47.789
Not gay?

14:47.814 --> 14:48.650
No!

14:52.948 --> 14:53.785
Are you all right?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.147
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

14:57.901 --> 14:58.669
Found it!

14:59.060 --> 15:01.007
So you're an artist, too?

15:01.032 --> 15:04.537
Uh, I like to dabble in
a lot of different things.

15:05.344 --> 15:07.724
I mean, life's too short
to live the same day twice, right?

15:07.749 --> 15:09.657
That's a good
philosophy to live by.

15:09.682 --> 15:12.600
Yeah. My dad always used
to say that. Come on.

15:12.625 --> 15:13.750
Used to?

15:14.308 --> 15:15.996
Oh, yeah, my parents died
when I was little.

15:16.021 --> 15:17.155
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.614
That's okay.
(It) was a really long time ago.

15:20.429 --> 15:21.254
Ready?

15:21.279 --> 15:22.916
Yeah, I mean, it's a little embarrassing.

15:22.941 --> 15:24.766
And I'm the doctor.
I'm the one who's supposed to look at the...

15:24.791 --> 15:26.016
Ouh! Ow!

15:26.041 --> 15:27.400
Oh my God. I'm sorry!

15:27.425 --> 15:28.322
I'm just kidding.

15:28.347 --> 15:29.825
I just...
I never get to do that.

15:31.795 --> 15:34.122
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

15:34.937 --> 15:35.700
Sorry.

15:37.326 --> 15:38.126
Do you need my phone?

15:38.151 --> 15:38.959
Oh, no thanks.

15:38.984 --> 15:41.203
It's just my mom.

15:41.228 --> 15:42.426
And it's only her
second page of the day.

15:42.451 --> 15:43.785
She's just getting started.

15:44.254 --> 15:46.332
Well, you're all set.

15:46.357 --> 15:47.042
Thank you.

15:49.051 --> 15:51.516
So, do you think...

15:51.541 --> 15:54.315
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

15:55.869 --> 15:57.246
Yeah, that would be nice.

16:01.231 --> 16:02.416
You heard from Kevin yet?

16:02.441 --> 16:03.777
Not yet. I've paged him.

16:03.802 --> 16:05.226
Would you page
him again?

16:05.251 --> 16:06.492
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

16:06.517 --> 16:07.695
You're in a good mood.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.636
Hey, the last time the network executives
came to my dressing room

16:10.661 --> 16:12.282
I got my own show and a big fat raise.

16:12.307 --> 16:13.494
Yeah and I had to start kissing your...

16:13.519 --> 16:14.851
Viola Fields?

16:15.483 --> 16:16.770
Oh my God!

16:16.795 --> 16:19.568
It is such an honor
to meet you.

16:19.593 --> 16:21.106
Oh thank you, darling.

16:21.131 --> 16:23.439
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

16:24.802 --> 16:26.165
For my grandmother.

16:28.758 --> 16:29.899
I'd love to.

16:31.079 --> 16:33.347
You know what else I'd love?
I'd love you to get me a latte.

16:33.372 --> 16:34.563
Do you mind?

16:34.588 --> 16:35.588
Okay.

16:35.613 --> 16:36.581
Thanks, hon.

16:37.798 --> 16:39.036
Hi, guys.
How are you?

16:42.146 --> 16:44.774
That woman is a legend.

16:45.226 --> 16:46.843
Shouldn't you be
getting the latte?

16:46.868 --> 16:49.655
I just can't believe
they picked me to replace her.

16:55.235 --> 16:56.573
Oh, shit!

16:57.493 --> 16:59.315
I've been replaced?

17:00.039 --> 17:01.574
I'm so sorry, Viola.

17:02.507 --> 17:03.414
I'm fine.

17:05.027 --> 17:08.375
I mean, you've had
an amazing career, Viola.

17:08.773 --> 17:14.377
It's just that we're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.250
I'm fine.

17:16.275 --> 17:17.103
I'm fine.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.868
God damn!
Get my manager on the phone!

17:21.430 --> 17:22.723
And then I'm gonna call
the head of the...

17:23.646 --> 17:24.396
Um...

17:24.422 --> 17:25.890
We're on in two minutes.

17:25.915 --> 17:26.690
Okay.

17:27.260 --> 17:28.664
Will you get her to come?

17:28.689 --> 17:29.194
Please!

17:29.219 --> 17:30.526
Okay, she'll be ready.

17:34.574 --> 17:35.933
I'm ready.

17:35.958 --> 17:38.347
♪Love got jeans
and a tee

You okay?

17:49.641 --> 17:50.393
I'm great.

17:50.912 --> 17:52.054
Hey, I've had
a great run.

17:52.079 --> 17:55.193
I've done exclusives with
Kissinger, the Dalai Lama,

17:55.218 --> 17:57.254
Muhammad Ali,

17:57.279 --> 17:59.288
four sitting presidents,

17:59.313 --> 18:00.983
three of them hit on me.

18:01.008 --> 18:02.366
Five Emmys!

18:04.257 --> 18:06.504
Oh, now I'm being replaced
by a young thing

18:06.529 --> 18:08.138
whose grandmother loves me.

18:08.606 --> 18:09.913
You know what
I'm gonna do?

18:09.938 --> 18:11.305
I'm gonna finish out my contract

18:11.330 --> 18:14.420
and I'm gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

18:15.266 --> 18:16.384
Okay, coming back
from commercial.

18:16.409 --> 18:18.351
Take 3, cue announcer.

18:18.376 --> 18:20.355
Today on Public Intimacy,

18:20.380 --> 18:23.382
pop singing sensation
Tanya Murphy.

18:23.407 --> 18:26.968
And now we're live
with Viola Fields.

18:26.993 --> 18:30.100
Four, three, two...

18:31.599 --> 18:33.013
Well, that was very nice.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.536
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

18:36.561 --> 18:38.260
You're gonna miss
Viola Fields.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.843
Have you always
been a singer?

18:39.868 --> 18:41.401
Ever since I was a child,

18:41.426 --> 18:44.013
I would sing
in school plays, choirs.

18:44.038 --> 18:45.475
How old are you?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.317
I'll be 17 next month.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.874
What do you do for fun?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.250
I love watching
really old movies.

18:55.275 --> 18:56.072
They're my favorite.

18:56.097 --> 18:58.017
Really? Really, which ones?

18:58.397 --> 19:00.982
Uh, well, "Grease"
and "Grease II."

19:01.007 --> 19:03.840
Um, "Benji."
I love "Benji."

19:04.800 --> 19:05.924
"Free Willy,"

19:07.117 --> 19:08.680
"Legally blonde,"

19:09.655 --> 19:10.989
"The Little Mermaid."

19:11.014 --> 19:12.913
Yeah. Oh, I know.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.757
You ever read a newspaper?

19:20.782 --> 19:21.996
Newspaper?

19:22.021 --> 19:24.546
Viola, the girl
has stars on her nipples.

19:24.808 --> 19:27.320
I don't have
much time for that.

19:27.697 --> 19:31.797
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what's going on in the world?

19:32.383 --> 19:34.447
Oh, l...
- And yet, you've sold over

19:34.472 --> 19:37.652
five million albums, CDs,

19:37.677 --> 19:41.038
to millions of kids who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

19:41.063 --> 19:43.390
"You wanna know me,
look in my makeup bag."

19:44.375 --> 19:47.418
You're influencing
an entire generation of kids

19:47.443 --> 19:49.460
who won't know how
to think straight,

19:49.485 --> 19:51.494
or vote for a president,

19:51.519 --> 19:54.442
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.845
Oh!

19:55.870 --> 19:57.898
I don't support
boxing as a sport.

19:57.922 --> 19:59.626
I think it's too violent.

20:00.586 --> 20:02.560
You all better get that
little girl out of there.

20:06.768 --> 20:07.922
Holy crap!

20:07.947 --> 20:09.339
Get us off the air!
Quick!

20:10.197 --> 20:11.914
Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

20:11.939 --> 20:12.954
Crazy bitch!

20:12.979 --> 20:13.814
Get off of me!

20:13.839 --> 20:14.791
Cut! Cut!
- Get her off!

20:14.816 --> 20:16.036
Put in the BowFlex tape!

20:16.061 --> 20:17.492
Juiceman, something!

20:20.146 --> 20:23.512
Oh, I don't support
boxing as a sport.

20:23.537 --> 20:25.161
I think it's too violent.

20:31.743 --> 20:32.760
Oh.

20:33.853 --> 20:37.390
I wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

20:37.824 --> 20:40.558
Oh, thank God
I've changed.

20:41.163 --> 20:42.464
Yes.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.738
Well, just remember,

20:44.763 --> 20:46.483
the breakdown was
only a few months ago.

20:46.508 --> 20:47.759
So...

20:47.784 --> 20:49.850
take it nice
and slow out there.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.032
No stress.

20:52.061 --> 20:53.295
Absolutely.

20:54.276 --> 20:56.481
In fact, I'm gonna take a vacation.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.882
I've been promising my son
we'd go to Africa

20:58.907 --> 21:00.548
since he was a little boy.

21:01.003 --> 21:03.112
And I finally have
the time.

21:03.642 --> 21:04.759
That's wonderful.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.315
Not to worry,

21:07.142 --> 21:08.844
I'm in complete control.

21:09.948 --> 21:11.258
Ruby!

21:11.283 --> 21:13.445
Ruby, my dear old friend.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.925
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

21:16.489 --> 21:18.832
You look good.
They still have you medicated.

21:19.432 --> 21:21.389
Ruby, I figured it out.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.243
Life, I mean.

21:22.268 --> 21:23.983
Oh, this ought to be good.

21:24.008 --> 21:27.606
It's not about how many celebrities
I interviewed or what my ratings are.

21:27.631 --> 21:30.674
It's about relationships
and family.

21:30.699 --> 21:31.387
Oh!

21:31.712 --> 21:33.221
Me and my son.

21:33.246 --> 21:35.311
Oh, I just spoke to Kevin.

21:35.978 --> 21:36.882
Did you get the tickets?

21:36.907 --> 21:38.855
Sure did. Right here.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.798
He's gonna be so surprised.

21:40.823 --> 21:43.168
Yeah, the three of you
shall have a good time.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.379
Three?

21:44.404 --> 21:45.006
Yeah.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.797
You, Kevin and
his new girlfriend.

21:49.232 --> 21:50.169
New girlfriend?

21:50.194 --> 21:52.976
Oh, that's a lovely surprise.

21:53.001 --> 21:54.012
Is it?

21:55.197 --> 21:56.686
Well, I mean,
it can't be too serious.

21:56.711 --> 21:58.898
I've only been away
a few months.

22:13.363 --> 22:15.649
Well, that's
the end of it.

22:16.679 --> 22:18.270
Where do you want me
to put this?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.263
Oh, under the bed.

22:20.568 --> 22:22.358
Uh, you sure you don't want me
to put it by the door

22:22.383 --> 22:26.064
so you can make a quick escape to the apartment you still have for some reason?

22:26.089 --> 22:28.937
No. Come on, you agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

22:28.962 --> 22:31.988
I would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

22:33.566 --> 22:35.358
Oh, these are great.
Are they new?

22:35.383 --> 22:37.383
Oh, no!
You can't look at those!

22:37.408 --> 22:38.357
'Cause they're
not finished yet.

22:38.382 --> 22:39.249
Oh, sorry.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.080
Okay?
- Okay.

22:40.105 --> 22:40.623
Please?

22:40.648 --> 22:41.832
Here, I'll put them back.

22:42.669 --> 22:43.506
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

22:43.531 --> 22:45.928
we're having lunch with
my mom tomorrow.

22:46.876 --> 22:47.620
Oh!

22:48.711 --> 22:50.406
It'll be fine.
I promise.

22:56.634 --> 22:58.027
You wanna take a shower?

22:59.206 --> 23:00.367
Hmm.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.098
Yeah! Okay!

23:04.070 --> 23:06.415
♪It's just a ride,
it's just a ride

23:06.440 --> 23:09.254
♪No need to run,
no need to hide

23:09.279 --> 23:11.311
♪lt'll take you
round and round.

23:11.336 --> 23:13.633
All right, so tell me
about your dad.

23:14.187 --> 23:15.716
Well, he died
when I was two.

23:15.741 --> 23:17.538
But that was just
her first husband.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.401
At the time she was
a freelance journalist

23:19.426 --> 23:22.845
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec

23:22.870 --> 23:25.054
and got her her first
on-air break,

23:25.079 --> 23:27.157
but divorced him
for Alec Wrigley.

23:27.182 --> 23:28.326
Wait, the actor?

23:28.351 --> 23:29.293
I thought he was...

23:29.318 --> 23:31.055
Oh, he was.
It lasted about two years

23:31.080 --> 23:33.938
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.786
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

23:36.811 --> 23:37.616
About four.

23:37.641 --> 23:38.184
Wow.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.762
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

23:39.787 --> 23:41.382
She just lived for it.

23:41.407 --> 23:43.673
Well, her career
and me, of course.

23:44.165 --> 23:46.229
And, basically,
now I'm all she's got.

23:51.436 --> 23:52.787
Here we are.

23:52.812 --> 23:54.039
Oh, no.

24:02.271 --> 24:04.520
Oh, playing dress-up,
are we?

24:08.816 --> 24:10.841
Shut up! Is that
the Dalai Lama?

24:10.866 --> 24:11.726
Yeah.

24:13.108 --> 24:15.195
Oh my God, That can't be real.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.134
It is.

24:18.428 --> 24:20.268
Did you know
all these people?

24:20.293 --> 24:20.937
Some of them.

24:20.962 --> 24:21.966
Kevin!

24:22.391 --> 24:24.657
Look at you, all handsome.

24:24.682 --> 24:25.510
Ruby!

24:25.886 --> 24:27.216
Good to see you.

24:27.241 --> 24:28.735
You too.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.998
Now, forget about
my mother.

24:30.023 --> 24:31.980
This is the woman
you need to get through.

24:32.005 --> 24:33.328
Charlie, this is Ruby.

24:33.792 --> 24:34.925
Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

24:34.950 --> 24:36.775
Oh, the pleasure's mine.

24:37.275 --> 24:40.700
Uh, excuse us.
I've got to talk to him about a rash.

24:44.116 --> 24:47.812
You're bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

24:47.837 --> 24:49.007
Yeah, Ruby, I am.

24:49.370 --> 24:51.830
The women is fresh off
the funny farm.

24:52.238 --> 24:55.354
Hey, why don't you come back,
let's say, next spring?

24:55.379 --> 24:56.918
Oh, the trees
will be blooming.

24:56.943 --> 24:57.498
Oh.

24:57.523 --> 24:59.084
It'll be so beautiful.
She'll love it.

24:59.109 --> 25:00.246
How is she?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.222
She's good.

25:02.247 --> 25:05.978
The first thing she did when she got home
was make me lock up all the booze.

25:06.003 --> 25:07.381
It's Oprah!

25:08.741 --> 25:09.990
Oprah!

25:10.015 --> 25:11.711
Yeah, Oprah.

25:11.736 --> 25:14.646
There's one in there
with the cast from "Good Times" too.

25:15.429 --> 25:17.338
So how big is this place?

25:17.363 --> 25:18.405
About four acres.

25:18.430 --> 25:21.486
There's a tennis court, two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor.

25:21.511 --> 25:22.814
It's kind of crazy.

25:23.350 --> 25:25.077
What?
No helicopter pad?

25:25.102 --> 25:27.007
Oh, no.
There's one out back.

25:27.032 --> 25:28.153
I'm kidding.

25:28.178 --> 25:29.406
Kevin!

25:29.710 --> 25:33.035
Oh, I've missed you
so much!

25:33.060 --> 25:34.908
I promise I'll never
leave you again.

25:36.656 --> 25:39.347
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.283
Oh, just something
I threw together.

25:41.989 --> 25:43.012
Come here.

25:43.037 --> 25:44.080
What?

25:44.105 --> 25:44.921
Introduce you to someone.

25:44.946 --> 25:46.636
- Charlie. Mom?
- Kevin.

25:47.248 --> 25:48.940
Charlie, this is Mom.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.183
Mom, Charlie.

25:52.324 --> 25:53.633
Oh, hi.

25:54.929 --> 25:58.015
Oh, I'd love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

25:58.040 --> 26:02.287
I must have spent the last 30 years
looking for the perfect little black...

26:02.312 --> 26:03.708
cocktail dress.

26:03.733 --> 26:04.618
Yes.

26:04.643 --> 26:05.475
I know.

26:06.719 --> 26:08.773
Well, it doesn't matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

26:08.798 --> 26:10.370
I mean, you look amazing.

26:10.395 --> 26:11.705
Oh, honey, thanks.

26:11.730 --> 26:15.275
Listen, when you're my age,
if ain't broke, you fix it before it is.

26:34.493 --> 26:35.932
Why the question mark?

26:35.957 --> 26:37.585
Oh, 'cause
I just don't know.

26:39.805 --> 26:40.339
Oh.

26:40.364 --> 26:41.439
I love your jewelry.

26:41.464 --> 26:42.533
Oh, yes.
- I love that.

26:42.558 --> 26:44.040
Yes, thank you.

26:44.065 --> 26:45.284
I like it, the earth tones.

26:45.309 --> 26:46.035
It's fantastic.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.374
Where did you get this from?

26:47.399 --> 26:48.267
My first husband.

26:48.292 --> 26:50.968
That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

26:50.993 --> 26:53.003
It's very earthy.
- It's like the dress,

26:53.028 --> 26:54.007
Yeah, very earthy.

27:01.514 --> 27:04.265
I just think it's wonderful
that you've tried so many temp jobs.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.656
Think of all
the experiences you have.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.335
You've been so quiet, Kevin.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.231
Oh, it's kind of hard to
get a word in edgewise with you two.

27:14.722 --> 27:17.057
Oh, is he great,
or what?

27:17.082 --> 27:19.175
I tell you too,
it's a little scary.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.791
Enjoy it while you can.

27:21.229 --> 27:23.289
Here you go,
some more coffee.

27:23.314 --> 27:25.695
Actually, I was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.014
- Really?
- Why?

27:27.039 --> 27:28.785
Well, 'cause it's
important to me.

27:29.006 --> 27:31.306
Mom, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

27:33.429 --> 27:35.873
And, Charlie,
I've never met anyone like you.

27:35.898 --> 27:38.069
You're real,
you're honest.

27:38.094 --> 27:39.803
And although we've only
known each other for a few months,

27:39.828 --> 27:42.666
I feel like
I've known you forever.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.898
I guess what I'm
trying to say here...

27:50.503 --> 27:52.744
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

27:53.954 --> 27:54.937
What?

28:01.154 --> 28:02.452
Oh my God!

28:03.742 --> 28:05.725
Charlie, will you
marry me?

28:07.766 --> 28:09.071
It's...

28:09.096 --> 28:10.245
it's too sudden.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.282
She's in shock.

28:11.307 --> 28:11.820
No!

28:11.845 --> 28:14.492
I mean, I am, but...

28:17.047 --> 28:18.662
Seriously?

28:18.687 --> 28:19.940
Seriously.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.954
No, no. Say "no."

28:21.979 --> 28:24.180
Yes. Yes!

28:24.205 --> 28:26.355
Yeah!

28:26.869 --> 28:28.153
Oh, gee... oh!

28:29.397 --> 28:30.609
Oh!

28:34.230 --> 28:35.731
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

28:36.613 --> 28:38.989
- Congratulations!
- Oh my God. I can't believe this.

28:39.014 --> 28:40.403
I am so happy for you.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.804
Congratulations!
I'm so pleased

28:42.829 --> 28:46.294
that you're gonna be
my daughter-in-law.

28:47.891 --> 28:49.527
Oh, congratulations.

28:49.552 --> 28:50.568
I can't believe this.

28:50.593 --> 28:52.328
I'm so happy for you.

28:52.910 --> 28:54.127
Thank you!

28:54.152 --> 28:55.751
You're gonna
need a moment alone.

28:56.406 --> 28:58.512
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.598
Oh!

28:59.623 --> 29:00.592
Shit!

29:03.732 --> 29:04.702
Ugh!

29:12.703 --> 29:13.294
What's...

29:13.319 --> 29:14.277
Ah!

29:14.302 --> 29:16.196
14% alcohol!

29:21.795 --> 29:23.735
You are so crazy! Oh my God!

29:23.760 --> 29:24.962
Oh, I almost forgot.

29:24.987 --> 29:27.628
I've been carrying this around for two weeks
waiting for the perfect moment.

29:27.653 --> 29:30.015
I can't believe that this
turned out to be it.

29:33.912 --> 29:35.172
Kevin.

29:35.197 --> 29:36.229
Try it on.

29:42.764 --> 29:44.302
It is the perfect moment.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.360
Maybe you should go
check on your mom.

29:49.385 --> 29:52.320
Oh, she's fine. She's probably
calling all of our relatives.

29:53.235 --> 29:55.667
Oh, Holy Spirit...

29:55.692 --> 29:57.667
surround me with light.

29:59.374 --> 30:02.146
Please rid me
of my negative karma

30:02.171 --> 30:04.273
and my wickedness.

30:05.009 --> 30:07.238
Please help me be
a better person.

30:09.132 --> 30:13.118
I could just kill
that dog-walking slut!

30:17.110 --> 30:18.692
Of course.

30:19.677 --> 30:21.459
She's pregnant.

30:22.336 --> 30:24.447
So, goodness.

30:24.472 --> 30:27.315
That was a lot to
take in at teatime.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.773
- Oh, you're telling me.
- I had no idea

30:29.798 --> 30:31.910
that you guys were so serious.

30:31.935 --> 30:34.359
Kevin, you never
mentioned anything.

30:34.384 --> 30:36.232
- Mom.
- Here's what I wanna say.

30:36.257 --> 30:38.396
It's wonderful
being in love.

30:39.188 --> 30:42.819
But I don't think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

30:45.591 --> 30:48.456
Well, you know nowadays a girl has
so many alternatives to getting married.

30:48.481 --> 30:51.265
I'm mean, there's adoption, abortion,
lesbianism...

30:51.290 --> 30:52.154
Whoa, Mom!

30:52.179 --> 30:53.009
Hmm?

30:53.034 --> 30:54.507
What are you talking about?

30:54.962 --> 30:58.524
Well, I mean, it's so sudden I have to
assume there's a pressing reason.

30:58.549 --> 31:00.462
Oh, oh, no.

31:00.487 --> 31:01.959
Charlie's not pregnant.

31:04.957 --> 31:06.957
Call me old-fashioned,

31:06.982 --> 31:09.318
marriage is a sacred union

31:09.343 --> 31:12.739
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

31:13.223 --> 31:15.039
Weren't you married
four times?

31:17.046 --> 31:18.180
Yes, dear.

31:19.858 --> 31:21.950
Which would make me an expert,
don't you think?

31:22.421 --> 31:23.335
Excuse me.

31:23.856 --> 31:24.843
I'm sorry.

31:26.457 --> 31:27.575
Oh, it's the hospital.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.528
I'll be right back.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.465
Okay.

31:31.444 --> 31:32.304
You want me to go
with you?

31:32.329 --> 31:33.387
No, stay right there.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.457
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

31:50.059 --> 31:51.537
It's too sudden, right?

31:51.562 --> 31:52.503
You think?

31:53.671 --> 31:54.608
Yeah.

31:55.357 --> 31:56.273
Really?

32:03.703 --> 32:06.047
I mean, what's the rush?
It's not like the old days

32:06.072 --> 32:08.007
when you have to get married
and have kids, and

32:08.032 --> 32:09.699
have it all figured out
by the time you are 21.

32:09.724 --> 32:10.628
Exactly.

32:10.653 --> 32:11.743
We would have options now.

32:11.768 --> 32:12.246
Yeah.

32:12.271 --> 32:13.764
And I've always liked
having my options, you know?

32:13.789 --> 32:15.248
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

32:15.804 --> 32:18.715
This is so... big.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.275
What am l...
what am I doing?

32:28.736 --> 32:29.956
I love Kevin.

32:31.870 --> 32:34.699
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with him.

32:34.724 --> 32:37.120
Oh my God!
I'm getting married!

32:40.583 --> 32:41.656
Ruby!

32:43.401 --> 32:44.730
Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.

32:44.755 --> 32:46.094
We're gonna celebrate.

32:46.119 --> 32:48.612
May I have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

32:48.637 --> 32:49.637
What key?

32:52.163 --> 32:53.322
The key, Ruby.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.872
Key?
There's no key.

32:56.332 --> 32:58.885
Ruby, give me the key.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.353
You want to take this
outside?

33:03.323 --> 33:05.987
Bring me the key!

33:12.538 --> 33:13.599
And fix your hair.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.661
You look like
a damned cockatoo.

33:19.424 --> 33:22.839
She is such
a fabulous assistant.

33:30.290 --> 33:32.083
Hey, do you think
your mother liked me?

33:33.249 --> 33:34.408
Of course. Why?

33:35.377 --> 33:37.789
I don't know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

33:40.033 --> 33:41.853
I'm sure she meant that
as a compliment.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.288
Trust me.
She loved you.

33:45.210 --> 33:46.400
Oh, they're gone?

33:46.795 --> 33:49.562
Ok. Well, I'll just put this baby
back to bed, okay?

33:49.975 --> 33:53.670
My son,
the brilliant surgeon

33:53.695 --> 33:57.550
is gonna marry a temp.

34:06.858 --> 34:09.109
Gonna need something
stronger than this.

34:10.773 --> 34:12.590
Where's that martini?

34:13.340 --> 34:15.322
Hooch will not solve
your problems.

34:16.772 --> 34:18.474
She's gonna destroy him.

34:18.498 --> 34:20.312
It is so clear.

34:20.618 --> 34:23.030
She's got no money,
no career goals.

34:24.340 --> 34:27.864
She's just waiting for a rich innocent
to step right in her path.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.313
Oh, Kevin's smarter than that.

34:30.339 --> 34:32.232
Come on,
you raised him well.

34:32.257 --> 34:33.473
He's a good boy.

34:34.716 --> 34:36.525
But he's a man.
That's the problem.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.704
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

34:38.728 --> 34:42.380
and it's usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

34:42.929 --> 34:44.793
You talking about
her or you?

34:47.025 --> 34:49.065
Look, there's nothing
you can do.

34:49.091 --> 34:50.371
Just let it go.

34:50.397 --> 34:51.915
You know what you need?

34:51.940 --> 34:53.091
A project.

34:53.116 --> 34:54.596
Or another husband.

34:55.106 --> 34:56.911
You know, why don't you
marry another gay guy?

34:56.937 --> 34:57.910
That was fun.

34:59.366 --> 35:00.411
You know, you're right.

35:00.436 --> 35:01.824
I do need a project.

35:03.237 --> 35:05.451
And I have
the perfect one.

35:05.476 --> 35:07.573
I am gonna save my son.

35:08.814 --> 35:09.663
Here.

35:09.695 --> 35:10.175
What?

35:10.200 --> 35:11.880
You go use those old
contacts of yours

35:11.905 --> 35:14.966
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

35:14.991 --> 35:17.514
And exactly what do you
expect to find?

35:18.569 --> 35:20.716
Everybody's got a past, honey.

35:21.221 --> 35:22.409
Find something.

35:22.434 --> 35:25.298
And I'm gonna open up
the Montecito house

35:25.323 --> 35:26.760
and get a party planner.

35:27.124 --> 35:29.868
I'm gonna give them
an engagement party.

35:29.893 --> 35:31.631
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

35:31.656 --> 35:34.369
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

35:34.394 --> 35:35.855
it's gonna be over.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.100
This will end badly.

35:40.053 --> 35:41.316
Get me another one
of those.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.359
♪Ooh-ohh

35:44.384 --> 35:47.586
♪I just wanna
get down with you

35:47.611 --> 35:48.598
Eh!

35:49.069 --> 35:52.001
♪I just wanna get close to you

35:52.026 --> 35:53.872
♪Ooh-ohh

35:53.897 --> 35:55.910
♪I just need to come farther...

35:55.935 --> 35:59.070
Is it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

36:06.229 --> 36:08.800
Well, I thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

36:09.303 --> 36:12.486
Oh my God. Looks like she's invited
everyone I've ever known.

36:15.182 --> 36:16.806
And they're all
in black tie.

36:17.472 --> 36:18.956
Oh, there's my mom.
Mom!

36:18.981 --> 36:19.869
Darlings!

36:20.236 --> 36:21.412
How was the trip?

36:23.322 --> 36:24.250
- I'm sorry.
- Welcome.

36:24.275 --> 36:26.247
I didn't know this was a formal party.

36:26.272 --> 36:28.926
Well, that's because I have something for you.
I bought you a new dress.

36:28.951 --> 36:30.703
Oh, see?
There's a dress upstairs.

36:30.728 --> 36:32.363
- Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

36:32.388 --> 36:36.001
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

36:37.477 --> 36:40.131
Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo's upstairs
in your room.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.246
But first I want you to meet
some friends. Come.

36:42.271 --> 36:42.607
Ok.

36:42.632 --> 36:43.944
- Prince Amir.
- Can I change first?

36:47.563 --> 36:48.423
This is Sarah.

36:48.448 --> 36:49.480
You know Kevin?

36:50.175 --> 36:51.584
And this is Charlie.

36:51.609 --> 36:52.824
She's a temp.

36:54.162 --> 36:57.349
Oh, Charlie, this is the man that introduced the
euro to the global market.

36:57.374 --> 36:58.788
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

36:58.813 --> 37:00.125
Oh, Marie.

37:00.150 --> 37:02.335
You know my son, but
this is Charlie.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.599
Very good to meet you.

37:03.624 --> 37:05.052
It's so nice to meet you.

37:05.077 --> 37:06.173
She's a temp.

37:07.034 --> 37:07.781
Yeah.

37:07.806 --> 37:10.078
I worked in a bank once.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.744
Oh, look! There's
the Poet Laureate and...

37:12.769 --> 37:15.540
Oh, Charlie, first I want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

37:15.565 --> 37:17.147
Viola, please let me
change first.

37:17.172 --> 37:19.123
I don't wanna meet her
in my flip-flops.

37:19.687 --> 37:23.112
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

37:23.137 --> 37:24.968
- Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

37:31.901 --> 37:32.833
Wow!

37:34.486 --> 37:35.566
Oh my...

37:36.565 --> 37:37.824
It's vintage.

37:40.322 --> 37:41.510
Oh, Fiona.

37:41.535 --> 37:42.893
You look stunning.

37:42.918 --> 37:44.235
Thank you. So do you.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.649
My goodness.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.139
Kevin just went up
to his old room.

37:49.164 --> 37:50.478
Why don't you go
say hello to him?

37:50.503 --> 37:51.523
I'd love to.

37:52.297 --> 37:53.167
Good girl.

38:08.572 --> 38:10.107
Fiona, what are you doing here?
I'm dressing.

38:10.132 --> 38:13.128
Why don't you let me give you
a hand with that?

38:13.153 --> 38:14.261
Give it up, Fiona.

38:16.613 --> 38:17.483
You know,

38:17.508 --> 38:20.881
you and I had a very
strong bond once.

38:21.649 --> 38:24.358
No, you and I had
very strong drinks once.

38:24.383 --> 38:25.391
That's not true.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.178
Kiss me. I'll remind you
how good it was.

38:29.203 --> 38:30.443
What are you doing?

38:30.832 --> 38:32.225
I'm engaged.
I'm happy.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.463
It's gonna fit!

38:34.859 --> 38:36.574
Why'd she get me
such a small dress?

38:39.484 --> 38:40.528
I've two asses.

38:44.787 --> 38:46.026
It'll fit.

38:46.051 --> 38:47.089
There we go.

38:47.767 --> 38:48.567
Okay.

38:49.035 --> 38:49.936
Okay!

38:50.280 --> 38:51.123
Okay!

38:54.864 --> 38:57.393
What is it about her
that's so special?

38:57.418 --> 39:00.284
I don't know, but I plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

39:03.799 --> 39:04.642
Kevin!

39:05.402 --> 39:09.153
God! Men in love
are really hot.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.610
Fiona!

39:13.131 --> 39:13.964
Oops!

39:13.989 --> 39:14.832
Um...

39:14.857 --> 39:17.764
I was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

39:18.434 --> 39:20.149
Don't, uh, worry.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.184
Why would I worry?
He's gay, right?

39:28.207 --> 39:29.063
Charlie!

39:37.245 --> 39:38.935
Charlie, that was not
what it looked like.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.568
I'm going home.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.594
I destroyed priceless couture,

39:44.217 --> 39:48.373
embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world's royalty.

39:49.352 --> 39:51.085
Oh! I forgot, yeah!

39:51.441 --> 39:54.625
I just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

39:55.733 --> 39:57.168
Charlie, let me explain.

39:57.193 --> 39:58.775
Ugh!
It doesn't matter.

40:02.294 --> 40:03.604
I can't do this.

40:08.587 --> 40:10.196
I don't belong here,
Kevin.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.185
And if I don't belong here
then maybe we don't...

40:14.210 --> 40:16.652
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

40:16.677 --> 40:17.990
It's you and me now.

40:19.772 --> 40:21.505
This isn't my world anymore.

40:22.206 --> 40:23.292
You're my world.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.827
Okay?

40:32.922 --> 40:35.366
Let's get the hell out of here.
I'm taking you home.

40:36.344 --> 40:37.237
Okay.

40:37.651 --> 40:38.836
Um...

40:39.829 --> 40:42.036
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

40:43.448 --> 40:44.540
Okay, see you
downstairs.

41:02.892 --> 41:07.768
♪There's a million miles
to go

41:08.550 --> 41:12.962
♪Till our happiness lives

41:13.687 --> 41:18.338
♪There's a million miles
to go

41:19.516 --> 41:24.211
♪Till our happiness lives.

41:25.047 --> 41:25.989
Do you like it?

41:26.465 --> 41:27.596
Yeah, it's great.

41:28.159 --> 41:30.046
I'm so glad you
finally decided to do it.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.745
I don't know. I just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

41:35.459 --> 41:36.921
I'm gonna do
all three walls.

41:37.684 --> 41:39.525
You know, I think it's time
to take a break.

41:39.550 --> 41:40.688
Oh, wait!

41:41.999 --> 41:43.082
- Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

41:43.107 --> 41:45.260
I can't let it dry
too much.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.223
Oh God!

41:49.871 --> 41:52.143
Are we getting out of bed
today, "Camille"?

41:53.344 --> 41:54.306
What for?

41:54.916 --> 41:57.185
I could die
and nobody would care.

41:57.537 --> 41:58.468
I would.

41:58.796 --> 42:00.646
You promised me
a face-lift.

42:02.209 --> 42:05.037
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.277
Have you got anything
on the girl yet?

42:10.302 --> 42:11.781
Nothing. Nada.

42:11.806 --> 42:13.140
No criminal record.

42:13.165 --> 42:14.148
No debt.

42:14.173 --> 42:14.929
Good grades.

42:14.954 --> 42:17.243
Went to design school.
Then a string of odd jobs.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.695
Isn't that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

42:20.580 --> 42:22.577
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

42:22.602 --> 42:24.986
She's had fewer lovers
in her entire life

42:25.011 --> 42:27.477
than you did
at closing day of Woodstock.

42:28.985 --> 42:30.201
Well, find something.

42:30.904 --> 42:35.223
Well, I guess if I had a hair sample, maybe I
could take it to my little crime lab and...

42:35.248 --> 42:36.136
Perfect.

42:37.414 --> 42:38.948
I'll get to work on it.

42:39.355 --> 42:40.643
Listen to me.

42:40.668 --> 42:41.959
There is nothing.

42:42.683 --> 42:44.963
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she's a good girl?

42:45.253 --> 42:46.591
Oh, don't joke.

42:48.443 --> 42:51.716
I would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

42:52.013 --> 42:53.238
Is she around?

42:53.590 --> 42:56.462
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

42:58.897 --> 42:59.916
Ruby, Ruby.

43:00.829 --> 43:02.691
Everybody knows when
a woman marries a man

43:02.716 --> 43:04.546
she marries his mother
too, right?

43:05.478 --> 43:07.632
What if I drive her crazy?

43:08.252 --> 43:10.286
Okay, now you're
foaming at the mouth.

43:18.266 --> 43:19.753
Charlie and Kevin's house.

43:20.238 --> 43:22.475
Oh, I forgot you live there.

43:24.004 --> 43:27.201
I didn't realize that you
had already moved in.

43:27.901 --> 43:30.192
Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone
with your mother!

43:30.217 --> 43:31.132
I'm sorry, Viola.

43:31.157 --> 43:33.155
The slut's practically
fornicating with him!

43:33.180 --> 43:33.878
Stop it!

43:33.903 --> 43:34.647
I don't blame her.

43:34.672 --> 43:36.286
That boy's a fine piece of ass.

43:37.247 --> 43:38.576
Hold on, Viola.
He's...

43:38.601 --> 43:40.392
Stop it! Right here.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.008
Actually, Charlie,
the reason I'm calling

43:42.033 --> 43:44.729
is I wondered if you'd like to
have lunch next week.

43:45.915 --> 43:46.837
Really?

43:47.383 --> 43:49.428
How would Tuesday
work for you?

43:49.453 --> 43:51.249
Yeah,
Tuesday's perfect!

43:52.019 --> 43:54.832
Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

43:54.857 --> 43:57.124
Um, but Tuesday's fine.

43:57.149 --> 43:58.253
Yeah, me too.

43:58.757 --> 44:00.011
Lots to do!

44:00.439 --> 44:01.345
Okay, bye!

44:03.222 --> 44:04.080
Oh.

44:07.790 --> 44:09.203
I'll go get the vodka.

44:22.844 --> 44:24.321
It's good to see you.

44:24.945 --> 44:26.022
There she is.

44:30.809 --> 44:32.197
Charlotte.

44:34.176 --> 44:36.610
Hi. I'm gonna have the garden salad

44:36.635 --> 44:40.514
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

44:40.539 --> 44:41.505
And you, miss?

44:41.530 --> 44:44.276
Oh, um, I'll just have a...

44:44.301 --> 44:46.636
cheeseburger
with fries and a soda.

44:46.661 --> 44:47.859
- All right.
- Okay.

44:48.971 --> 44:50.811
You continue
to surprise me.

44:52.006 --> 44:54.473
Arert you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

44:54.995 --> 44:58.014
Well, I mean, I'm making the dress
to fit my body,

44:58.039 --> 44:59.050
not the other way around.

44:59.513 --> 45:02.031
Whoa. I wish I had been
that confident when I got married.

45:02.622 --> 45:04.882
I'll tell you one thing
you're gonna have that I never did,

45:04.907 --> 45:06.889
a stupendous wedding.

45:07.650 --> 45:10.444
And it's important that we
book the church right away.

45:11.538 --> 45:14.317
I always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus

45:14.342 --> 45:16.346
in the cathedral down on Second Street.

45:19.063 --> 45:21.647
Actually, we were thinking
of having a

45:21.672 --> 45:23.524
non-denominational service,

45:23.549 --> 45:26.163
being that I'm more spiritual
than religious.

45:26.467 --> 45:27.293
Oh.

45:29.911 --> 45:31.623
What about my place then?

45:31.988 --> 45:34.079
That way we don't even
need to book a location.

45:34.104 --> 45:35.965
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

45:35.990 --> 45:38.111
Oh, it would mean
so much to him.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.130
I'll plan it all.

45:39.155 --> 45:42.767
We'll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons' had at their wedding,

45:42.792 --> 45:43.951
and a divine cake.

45:43.976 --> 45:44.862
Oh, honey!

45:44.887 --> 45:46.159
No no no!

45:47.150 --> 45:49.118
Chewing,
it's a disgusting habit.

45:50.637 --> 45:52.743
Oh, hold still.
I've gotta...

45:52.768 --> 45:53.467
- There!
- Ow!

45:53.492 --> 45:54.151
Got it!

45:55.731 --> 45:57.289
Thanks, um...

45:57.915 --> 45:59.420
What do you think
about peach?

46:01.551 --> 46:03.663
- Oh, um, excuse me.
- Yes?

46:03.688 --> 46:05.410
Can I get another salad
without the nuts?

46:05.435 --> 46:06.957
I have allergies.

46:06.982 --> 46:07.846
Okay.

46:07.871 --> 46:10.548
I'm allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

46:10.573 --> 46:11.928
and blueberries.

46:11.953 --> 46:13.334
Oh, and soy.

46:13.455 --> 46:16.242
It's amazing you've been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

46:18.626 --> 46:19.590
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

46:19.615 --> 46:23.944
I'm thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

46:24.888 --> 46:28.615
Look, Viola, I really do have
all of this under control.

46:28.640 --> 46:29.698
I made this for you.

46:29.723 --> 46:32.164
It's your wedding planner book.
Peach.

46:36.204 --> 46:36.929
Oh.

46:37.430 --> 46:38.675
Is that a picture
of me and Kevin?

46:38.700 --> 46:39.972
Oh, and...

46:39.997 --> 46:42.089
present time from your new mama!

46:43.060 --> 46:43.806
Thanks.

46:51.046 --> 46:51.796
Wow!

46:54.358 --> 46:55.418
Big!

46:55.443 --> 46:56.777
You can see the thorns on the roses.

46:56.802 --> 46:59.014
You'll wear it on your wedding day,
just like I did.

47:00.118 --> 47:02.218
Of course I was
a virgin when I wed.

47:02.984 --> 47:05.057
But we'll just pretend
with you.

47:06.055 --> 47:07.290
Now, about the wedding,

47:07.315 --> 47:10.012
the two of you are gonna arrive
in a horse and carriage.

47:10.037 --> 47:13.302
And the driver's top hat
will match the horse's saddles

47:13.327 --> 47:15.099
and the ribbons on the doves

47:15.124 --> 47:20.494
that will be released at the
exact moment of "I do."

47:20.519 --> 47:21.318
Hmm?

47:22.583 --> 47:24.789
And I've been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

47:25.563 --> 47:26.919
How do you know
their names?

47:26.944 --> 47:29.553
Well, Kevin told me.
And I think for the honeymoon

47:29.578 --> 47:31.994
St. Bart's is the absolute
best place for you to go

47:32.019 --> 47:32.961
'cause Kevin adores it.

47:32.986 --> 47:34.568
Hey, just... hold on!

47:34.593 --> 47:36.069
Just wait
a minute, okay?

47:39.386 --> 47:40.444
No.

47:41.308 --> 47:42.994
Thank you, but no.

47:43.572 --> 47:45.722
Thank you,
but no to everything.

47:46.012 --> 47:48.565
No to the horse
and buggy.

47:48.590 --> 47:52.318
No to the top hats,
and to the doves and geese

47:52.343 --> 47:54.985
and any other farm animals
you're thinking of using that day.

47:55.010 --> 47:57.671
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

47:58.048 --> 47:59.396
- What?
- Oh no.

47:59.421 --> 48:00.480
I can... oh!

48:00.814 --> 48:01.660
Oh!

48:01.864 --> 48:03.361
- What's wrong?
- Oh!

48:03.386 --> 48:05.409
- "Oh no" what?
- My pills, my pills!

48:05.434 --> 48:06.806
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

48:06.831 --> 48:07.774
Oh!

48:08.096 --> 48:09.024
Viola!

48:09.450 --> 48:10.851
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

48:11.794 --> 48:12.687
Viola!

48:13.192 --> 48:14.042
Viola!

48:15.834 --> 48:17.931
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

48:18.494 --> 48:20.095
- Give her some room.
- Help!

48:21.092 --> 48:22.619
My God, is she dead?

48:22.644 --> 48:24.043
- No!
- Get her some help.

48:25.438 --> 48:26.648
It couldn't be
that easy.

48:32.078 --> 48:34.262
She's had an anxiety attack,

48:34.287 --> 48:36.177
which can feel like
a heart attack.

48:36.613 --> 48:37.829
She's gonna be okay.

48:38.305 --> 48:41.174
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

48:42.025 --> 48:45.556
Uh, she said that you were yelling at her,
refused her gift

48:45.581 --> 48:47.848
and said she couldn't
plan our wedding.

48:48.308 --> 48:49.650
Tell me that's
not true.

48:51.127 --> 48:54.501
Well, technically...

48:54.526 --> 48:55.227
yes.

48:55.252 --> 48:57.412
But, hold on.
I didn't yell at her.

48:57.437 --> 49:00.214
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

49:00.239 --> 49:03.392
And, okay, I admit it.
I snapped a little bit. But...

49:03.417 --> 49:06.360
I mean, what was I supposed to do?
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

49:06.385 --> 49:08.585
Oh, come on, look, you know
what a hard time she's been having.

49:08.610 --> 49:09.892
So she's a little difficult.

49:09.917 --> 49:10.930
Difficult?

49:10.955 --> 49:12.232
A two-year-old
is difficult.

49:12.257 --> 49:15.080
- She's like... ah!
- Come on, I mean, she's all alone.

49:15.105 --> 49:16.859
I'm all she's got...
we're all she's got.

49:17.683 --> 49:18.704
Come on.

49:19.801 --> 49:20.737
Excuse me.

49:21.294 --> 49:23.214
I'm Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

49:23.239 --> 49:24.062
You Mrs. Fields's son?

49:24.087 --> 49:24.774
Yes.

49:24.799 --> 49:25.832
May we speak in private?

49:25.857 --> 49:27.816
Oh, actually, this is my fiancée.
We can talk.

49:27.841 --> 49:29.506
Um, is she okay?

49:29.813 --> 49:32.617
Well, I just completed your mother's
interview and I'm concerned.

49:33.107 --> 49:36.510
It's possible that she's on the verge
of a psychotic break.

49:37.146 --> 49:40.575
I should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.177
Also, I prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

49:43.202 --> 49:46.031
If she starts to feel overwhelmed,
they'll relax her.

49:46.056 --> 49:47.488
Does she live alone?

49:47.513 --> 49:48.559
Uh, yeah.

49:49.973 --> 49:51.142
Well, I feel it would be best

49:51.167 --> 49:53.262
if she were cared for
by relatives,

49:53.287 --> 49:55.274
people that are closest
to her during this time.

49:55.299 --> 49:58.123
Just until we're confident
that she's out of danger.

49:58.876 --> 49:59.626
All right.

49:59.651 --> 50:00.718
Well, thank you, Doctor.

50:02.712 --> 50:04.201
Ah, God.

50:04.389 --> 50:05.968
I've got that
medical conference.

50:05.993 --> 50:07.124
What am I gonna do?

50:08.304 --> 50:09.663
You know what?
Don't...

50:09.688 --> 50:10.661
Don't worry about it.

50:10.686 --> 50:13.259
Um, I'll take care of her.

50:16.553 --> 50:17.484
Thank you.

50:18.034 --> 50:18.776
Come on.

50:19.012 --> 50:19.633
What?

50:19.657 --> 50:21.563
- You know, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

50:21.588 --> 50:23.045
- All right? Charlie, come on.
- I'll stay here.

50:23.070 --> 50:24.004
- Enough already.
- Kevin.

50:24.029 --> 50:25.020
Come on.

50:28.584 --> 50:29.517
Come on.

50:34.129 --> 50:35.877
I am so sorry.

50:36.114 --> 50:38.622
No, Mom, don't be.
It's okay, really.

50:38.647 --> 50:39.636
Charlie?

50:41.775 --> 50:43.664
I'm sorry too, Viola.

50:44.038 --> 50:45.842
No, I was too pushy.

50:48.368 --> 50:49.507
No.

50:49.532 --> 50:52.092
You weren't.
Look, Viola...

50:53.500 --> 50:55.980
I would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

50:56.005 --> 50:58.635
It's all right, sweetheart,
l...

50:58.660 --> 51:00.514
I don't really think
I'm up to it.

51:01.241 --> 51:02.794
My nerves are shot.

51:06.694 --> 51:07.728
Mom...

51:10.077 --> 51:12.513
Mom, Charlie and I think
you should live with us for a while,

51:12.538 --> 51:13.914
until you feel better.

51:15.410 --> 51:16.440
Are you sure?

51:18.959 --> 51:19.677
Oh!

51:21.468 --> 51:23.636
- Oh, I can't possibly.
- Mom.

51:23.661 --> 51:25.445
- I couldn't.
- It's okay. Relax.

51:27.764 --> 51:29.187
I couldn't possibly.

51:31.397 --> 51:33.593
Not unless I know
Charlotte's forgiven me.

51:35.102 --> 51:36.166
Will you?

51:38.501 --> 51:39.370
Me?

51:39.875 --> 51:41.099
Yeah, I forgive you.

51:46.662 --> 51:47.075
Oh.

51:47.100 --> 51:49.642
Yeah, you just put those
anywhere.

51:53.718 --> 51:54.973
- Hi!
- Hi.

51:54.998 --> 51:57.174
- Are you feeling better?
- I'm much better, thank you.

51:57.199 --> 51:58.014
Great.

51:58.639 --> 51:59.777
Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty.

51:59.802 --> 52:01.225
Would you...
Is the kitchen over there?

52:01.250 --> 52:01.893
Yeah, sure.

52:01.918 --> 52:02.635
Great.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.009
Okay.

52:06.461 --> 52:07.371
Hey, Charlie.

52:07.396 --> 52:08.556
You moving in, too?

52:08.581 --> 52:10.155
No, I don't like
the neighborhood.

52:10.180 --> 52:12.579
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

52:13.463 --> 52:14.170
No.

52:14.810 --> 52:16.132
You might wanna get one.

52:23.294 --> 52:24.609
When will you be back?

52:25.039 --> 52:26.799
Soon as I can, honey.
I promise.

52:28.926 --> 52:30.207
(Are you) sure you're gonna be okay?

52:30.572 --> 52:33.837
Yeah. I mean, hey, it's
only at night, right?

52:33.862 --> 52:34.748
And...

52:34.773 --> 52:38.182
I mean, she's gonna sleep most of the time
with those pills the doctor gave her.

52:38.207 --> 52:38.925
Right?

52:39.400 --> 52:41.488
Look, I know my mom can be
a little challenging.

52:41.513 --> 52:43.149
So if you have any
problems, just call me.

52:43.174 --> 52:44.965
I'm on the first flight back,
I promise.

52:44.990 --> 52:45.788
Okay.

52:46.677 --> 52:47.924
Well, hurry home.

52:49.168 --> 52:50.515
And who knows?
By the time I get back,

52:50.540 --> 52:52.297
maybe you two will be best friends.

52:53.267 --> 52:55.181
Oh, am I interrupting
something?

52:55.548 --> 52:56.634
Uh, no, Mom, come in.

52:56.659 --> 52:57.564
The caterer called.

52:57.589 --> 52:59.533
He still thinks
I'm doing the wedding.

52:59.558 --> 53:01.961
He sent over a sample plate
'cause I gave him the colors you wanted.

53:01.986 --> 53:04.310
I said absolutely no peach.

53:04.875 --> 53:08.806
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

53:09.463 --> 53:10.326
Thank you.

53:10.351 --> 53:11.067
Yeah?

53:11.092 --> 53:12.561
Okay, I'll be
right down, thanks.

53:12.586 --> 53:13.623
Oh, here. Look.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.925
Oh, it's beautiful, Viola.

53:16.968 --> 53:19.076
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

53:19.101 --> 53:20.843
My car's here. Gotta go.

53:20.868 --> 53:22.441
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

53:22.466 --> 53:23.378
Oh, bye, sweetie.

53:23.873 --> 53:25.123
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

53:25.148 --> 53:26.867
- We're gonna have such a good time.
- Okay.

53:27.572 --> 53:29.435
- I'll be a good roommate. I promise.
- Okay.

53:32.460 --> 53:35.387
It's so nice
to have a girlfriend.

53:35.412 --> 53:36.404
Yeah.

54:04.688 --> 54:05.712
Viola?

54:06.183 --> 54:07.425
Are you all right?

54:07.772 --> 54:09.004
I can't sleep.

54:12.095 --> 54:13.878
I feel so alone.

54:14.922 --> 54:15.887
I do.

54:16.421 --> 54:18.014
You're not alone.
I'm here.

54:21.188 --> 54:22.956
Did you take
your pills?

54:22.981 --> 54:23.934
My pills?

54:25.004 --> 54:26.055
Oh no, I forgot.

54:27.510 --> 54:28.659
Could you get them
for me, sweetie?

54:28.684 --> 54:29.872
They're on the sink.

54:31.987 --> 54:32.777
Sure.

54:33.072 --> 54:33.873
Okay.

54:41.333 --> 54:42.516
Here they are.

54:44.305 --> 54:45.077
Thank you.

54:45.102 --> 54:46.359
You're welcome.

54:46.384 --> 54:49.249
Oh, I don't have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

54:50.049 --> 54:50.825
Okay.

54:51.562 --> 54:53.691
Oh, I can't drink out
of the tap.

54:54.962 --> 54:58.210
Would you get me some Evian
with ice?

55:00.029 --> 55:00.740
Yeah.

55:09.550 --> 55:10.560
Here you go.

55:10.585 --> 55:11.660
Oh, thank you.

55:14.794 --> 55:16.410
You have a good night,
okay?

55:18.109 --> 55:19.129
Charlotte?

55:20.249 --> 55:21.441
I hate to ask you this,

55:21.466 --> 55:23.360
but it's my first night here.

55:24.697 --> 55:26.549
Could you stay with me?

55:27.635 --> 55:28.577
Please?

55:28.602 --> 55:30.600
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

55:34.554 --> 55:37.019
Huh? No no no!

55:37.624 --> 55:38.437
Don't!

55:40.358 --> 55:41.300
God!

55:41.518 --> 55:42.398
Viola!

55:42.774 --> 55:44.567
- Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

55:51.201 --> 55:52.029
No.

56:04.348 --> 56:04.996
Oh!

56:05.600 --> 56:06.964
Okay. Okay.

56:29.881 --> 56:31.989
Hi, how was your day?

56:32.505 --> 56:33.987
It was... okay.

56:34.304 --> 56:35.589
Wonderful!

56:35.836 --> 56:36.933
You're cooking.

56:36.958 --> 56:39.423
I wanted to make you
dinner all by myself.

56:40.851 --> 56:41.795
Sit.

56:41.971 --> 56:42.794
Okay.

56:45.901 --> 56:47.338
It's steak
and kidney pie.

56:47.583 --> 56:50.904
Actually, the steak didn't defrost
in time so it's mostly kidney.

56:50.929 --> 56:51.880
Mmm!

56:52.987 --> 56:53.730
Do you like it?

56:53.755 --> 56:54.594
Mm-hm!

56:57.718 --> 56:59.108
I made a decision today.

56:59.845 --> 57:02.573
I called my lawyer
and I asked him to redo my will.

57:03.669 --> 57:05.375
I wanna include
my new daughter.

57:09.481 --> 57:11.413
Really, Viola,
that's not necessary.

57:11.438 --> 57:12.816
Oh, don't be silly.
I want to.

57:12.841 --> 57:15.996
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they wanna ask.

57:16.021 --> 57:18.888
You know, like, "Are you
currently an illegal alien?"

57:19.236 --> 57:21.173
Oh, uh...

57:21.198 --> 57:21.831
No.

57:23.156 --> 57:25.071
Oh, that's interesting.
Okay.

57:25.456 --> 57:28.494
Um, are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

57:28.519 --> 57:31.578
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

57:31.603 --> 57:32.589
Uh, no.

57:32.614 --> 57:33.306
No.

57:33.331 --> 57:36.067
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

57:36.341 --> 57:37.249
What?

57:37.274 --> 57:38.640
Why would they wanna know that?

57:39.082 --> 57:40.306
That many, huh?

57:42.053 --> 57:44.507
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

57:46.935 --> 57:48.211
Excuse me?

57:48.236 --> 57:48.972
I know.

57:48.997 --> 57:51.612
They're such nosy bastards.
It's none of their business.

57:51.637 --> 57:52.689
Let's just deal with this later.

57:52.714 --> 57:54.320
No, why don't we deal
with it right now?

57:58.525 --> 57:59.496
I'll tell you what,

57:59.521 --> 58:02.373
I'll clean up the kitchen and you
continue enjoying your dinner.

58:03.204 --> 58:04.474
No no no.

58:05.632 --> 58:07.340
You did all the cooking.
I'll clean up.

58:07.772 --> 58:08.541
Are you sure?

58:08.566 --> 58:09.234
Yeah.

58:09.259 --> 58:10.762
I am kind of tired.

58:11.039 --> 58:11.789
Thanks.

58:12.196 --> 58:13.410
Well, I'll just
go up to bed then.

58:13.435 --> 58:16.085
I had kind of a difficult
night last night.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.913
You had (a difficult night?)

58:22.556 --> 58:23.907
He's skidding
out of control.

58:23.932 --> 58:25.488
This bus is out of control.

58:33.041 --> 58:34.490
Somebody there?

58:34.515 --> 58:35.445
Tina.

58:38.921 --> 58:39.922
Tina.

58:40.412 --> 58:41.680
Who the hell is that?

59:01.429 --> 59:02.086
Oh.

59:02.553 --> 59:03.492
What?

59:03.517 --> 59:04.751
Oh my God.

59:04.776 --> 59:05.867
I thought you were sleeping.

59:05.892 --> 59:06.939
Well, I couldn't sleep.

59:07.736 --> 59:09.747
Hmm? What do you think
of my outfit?

59:10.350 --> 59:13.012
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

59:13.037 --> 59:14.499
These go with the robe.

59:14.524 --> 59:17.563
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama,

59:17.588 --> 59:19.584
who never forgot my birthday.

59:20.366 --> 59:22.287
Of course now
he doesn't care anymore.

59:22.784 --> 59:24.070
- Do you mind if I sit with you?
- No.

59:24.095 --> 59:25.017
Just for a little while.

59:25.042 --> 59:25.696
Okay.

59:29.342 --> 59:30.563
Why's she running?

59:31.212 --> 59:33.130
Well, someone's
chasing her.

59:34.587 --> 59:35.995
Why is he chasing her?

59:37.073 --> 59:37.784
I'm not sure.

59:37.809 --> 59:38.691
Well, who is he?

59:38.716 --> 59:39.793
Well...

59:39.818 --> 59:41.644
I don't know.
We have to watch.

59:41.669 --> 59:42.919
You have to stop talking.

59:42.944 --> 59:43.702
Mm.

59:44.448 --> 59:45.493
Don't you hate
what she's wearing?

59:45.518 --> 59:46.390
I mean,

59:46.415 --> 59:48.222
running out there with bare feet,
and

59:48.247 --> 59:51.051
what is that, a pajama top?
It's so unrealistic.

59:51.720 --> 59:54.648
I once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

59:54.673 --> 59:56.666
You would not believe

59:56.691 --> 59:59.578
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

59:59.603 --> 01:00:01.691
I mean it's just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:05.036
Oh, it's so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing, huh?

01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:07.336
Don't even need to talk.
It's wonderful.

01:00:08.399 --> 01:00:10.318
I miss so much
being a working mom.

01:00:10.343 --> 01:00:12.056
I used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:14.098
That's where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

01:00:14.123 --> 01:00:15.504
Is there anybody famous
in this movie?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.234
Because I don't know
any of them.

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:18.287
And they all look the same.

01:00:18.312 --> 01:00:20.272
All the girls have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

01:00:20.297 --> 01:00:22.986
I wonder why there're so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

01:00:23.011 --> 01:00:26.856
I think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:28.559
Why is he kissing her?

01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:29.596
It's beyond me.

01:00:48.009 --> 01:00:51.174
I'm sorry. I thought
it was air freshener.

01:01:01.316 --> 01:01:02.000
Charlie?

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.311
Dr. Batel's office.

01:01:05.292 --> 01:01:06.456
Miss Reynolds?

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:08.466
Hi.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:09.628
Yeah.

01:01:10.335 --> 01:01:11.185
Nope.

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.466
Okay.

01:01:12.692 --> 01:01:13.534
Bye.

01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:20.582
Oh, God. I...

01:01:20.607 --> 01:01:22.952
I'm sorry. You know what?
That's probably my fault.

01:01:22.977 --> 01:01:23.928
I...

01:01:23.953 --> 01:01:25.694
I mean,
I never thought she'd...

01:01:25.719 --> 01:01:27.893
I mean, she's a little
eccentric, you know?

01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:29.751
I'm sorry.

01:01:29.776 --> 01:01:30.562
Well, It doesn't matter.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.917
I don't want to talk about your mom
tonight. I want to talk about us.

01:01:33.942 --> 01:01:35.457
I miss you.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.324
I miss you too.

01:01:38.582 --> 01:01:41.542
Especially now
when I'm in the tub...

01:01:42.538 --> 01:01:44.636
naked and wet...

01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:46.303
and naked.

01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:48.549
Really?

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.391
Well, do you know what I'd do
to you if I was there?

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.011
What?

01:01:52.036 --> 01:01:53.019
Well, for starters...

01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:53.749
Charlie!

01:01:54.899 --> 01:01:57.183
- I'm not looking. I'm not looking.
- Hello?

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.951
- I wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:01.965
You know, you really should use a shampoo
that doesn't dry your hair so much.

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:04.566
We don't want a bride
with straw under her veil.

01:02:04.591 --> 01:02:06.069
- Oh, is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

01:02:06.094 --> 01:02:07.623
Oh, honey, your mom
wants to talk to you.

01:02:07.648 --> 01:02:08.830
Sweetie, hi.

01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:09.880
Hi, Mom.

01:02:09.905 --> 01:02:12.372
Oh, honey, I can't thank
you both enough.

01:02:12.755 --> 01:02:13.400
Of course.

01:02:13.425 --> 01:02:15.764
I'm having the
most wonderful time.

01:02:16.355 --> 01:02:17.222
How's Charlie?

01:02:17.247 --> 01:02:18.776
Oh, she's been a doll.

01:02:19.222 --> 01:02:20.997
We've been girlfriends
all week.

01:02:21.522 --> 01:02:22.453
Great.

01:02:22.478 --> 01:02:24.025
I'm gonna be sad to go home.

01:02:25.017 --> 01:02:25.807
You do?

01:02:25.832 --> 01:02:28.347
Well, you never know what the future's
gonna bring, right?

01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:30.309
I mean, I do love
this neighborhood.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:32.246
In fact, you know,
two doors down,

01:02:32.271 --> 01:02:33.806
there's this house for sale.

01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:35.773
It's got two big bay windows

01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:37.555
and a great rose garden.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.277
You know how
I love rose gardens.

01:02:39.302 --> 01:02:42.049
And you know, basically,
it's got my name all over it.

01:02:42.074 --> 01:02:43.885
I'm having my...

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:45.685
real estate guy
look into it.

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.034
She's buying a house here?

01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:49.609
Two doors away.

01:02:50.022 --> 01:02:53.221
"Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows."

01:02:53.246 --> 01:02:54.672
It's bullshit!

01:02:55.118 --> 01:02:57.220
She doesn't even like
this neighborhood.

01:02:57.755 --> 01:02:59.524
Oh God, I'm so exhausted.

01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:01.319
She's driving me insane!

01:03:02.385 --> 01:03:03.760
I can't do this.

01:03:03.785 --> 01:03:05.159
Yes, you can!

01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:08.202
Stop being
such a big baby.

01:03:08.227 --> 01:03:10.304
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:13.233
Charlie, do not
give up on this one.

01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:17.904
(It) seems Mommy Dearest has been keeping
a very close eye on you, sweetie.

01:03:18.611 --> 01:03:21.007
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

01:03:21.508 --> 01:03:24.684
I was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:27.318
And I found all of this
in her closet.

01:03:27.343 --> 01:03:29.797
She's been investigating you.

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:31.450
Whoa.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.739
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

01:03:33.764 --> 01:03:34.557
I know.

01:03:37.412 --> 01:03:39.499
There's a picture of me
at the beach?!

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.707
- Oh my God, I can not believe that.
- Yes, it is.

01:03:41.732 --> 01:03:43.260
There's another picture
of you in here.

01:03:43.285 --> 01:03:44.202
And it's...

01:03:44.648 --> 01:03:46.338
Look, look at that.
It's like a closeup.

01:03:46.363 --> 01:03:49.057
- But you have to be close to take that, right?
- Oh, my God!

01:03:49.082 --> 01:03:50.924
Look at all this Gucci!

01:03:50.949 --> 01:03:53.631
It's just
Gucci Gucci Gucci!

01:03:53.656 --> 01:03:57.095
Oh, she has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.435
I've heard of that.
I want a try.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.203
Here.

01:03:59.433 --> 01:04:00.799
- Mm.
- Doesn't that smell good?

01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:02.906
Ooh, hello.

01:04:03.412 --> 01:04:05.085
What are these?

01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:07.472
Those are
just her anti-anxiety pills.

01:04:07.497 --> 01:04:09.523
Ooh, these are good.

01:04:09.548 --> 01:04:10.016
Really?

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:12.268
They'd knock out a horse.
I have these at home.

01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:12.935
You do?

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.708
Wait.

01:04:15.228 --> 01:04:17.222
Well, I don't know what these are.
But they're definitely not what I take.

01:04:17.247 --> 01:04:18.011
These...

01:04:18.036 --> 01:04:19.549
They smell like oranges.

01:04:19.574 --> 01:04:20.554
Are you sure?

01:04:20.579 --> 01:04:21.282
Yeah.

01:04:21.477 --> 01:04:22.272
Let me see.

01:04:26.919 --> 01:04:28.133
Hi, Andy.

01:04:28.158 --> 01:04:29.043
It's Charlie.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.173
Yeah. No, I'm not working
for Dr. Batel's office this week.

01:04:32.198 --> 01:04:33.765
But I had a question.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:35.379
Yeah, about some pills.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.417
Can I stop by?

01:04:37.212 --> 01:04:39.531
Charlie, I'm having
a bit of a bad day,

01:04:39.556 --> 01:04:42.285
so Ruby's gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.364
Okay!

01:04:43.822 --> 01:04:45.060
You take care!

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.341
Let's see
what you're up to.

01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.605
- There you go.
- Well, thank you. Thank you so much.

01:04:59.117 --> 01:05:01.031
- And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:03.545
Okay, now Cartier's one right down.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.868
Where's Niketown?

01:05:04.893 --> 01:05:05.450
What?

01:05:05.475 --> 01:05:06.262
Niketown.

01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:07.219
Niketown?

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:08.977
Bad day, my ass.

01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:22.763
Wait a minute.

01:05:23.643 --> 01:05:25.044
Dr. Chamberlain?

01:05:26.526 --> 01:05:27.299
All right.

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:33.040
Hello?

01:05:33.689 --> 01:05:34.866
Hey, Andy.

01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:36.954
Yeah. What are they?

01:05:39.205 --> 01:05:41.352
Chewable vitamin Cs, huh?

01:05:42.142 --> 01:05:43.264
Okay, thanks.

01:05:52.551 --> 01:05:54.875
I know. I can't believe
the wedding's only a week away.

01:05:56.847 --> 01:05:58.731
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

01:05:58.756 --> 01:05:59.697
Oh!

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.340
Wait a minute. I think
I hear her car.

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:06.637
Drop my stuff
at my house, okay?

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.035
All right.
Look crazy.

01:06:23.433 --> 01:06:24.311
Ouh!

01:06:24.336 --> 01:06:25.252
Charlie!

01:06:31.992 --> 01:06:32.973
Charlie!

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.019
Oh, I had to bring him
home with me today.

01:06:35.044 --> 01:06:36.028
He's harmless.

01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:38.459
Sit.

01:06:38.484 --> 01:06:39.251
No!

01:06:39.276 --> 01:06:40.812
No. No.

01:06:40.837 --> 01:06:42.124
No, Zorro! Sit!

01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:43.615
Ugh!

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:50.905
Is that expensive?

01:06:53.793 --> 01:06:54.709
It was.

01:06:59.577 --> 01:07:00.517
Sorry!

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:13.453
Oh!

01:07:16.235 --> 01:07:17.720
Charlie!

01:07:21.112 --> 01:07:21.901
Bonus.

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:24.565
Good boy.

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:25.510
Come on.

01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:27.207
Come on.

01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:32.540
Mmm.

01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:36.218
Hello, old friend.

01:07:36.576 --> 01:07:37.610
Viola!

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.043
You can't mix alcohol
with your pills!

01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:44.829
I'm a little upset

01:07:44.854 --> 01:07:46.353
as you can imagine.

01:07:46.732 --> 01:07:48.792
Well, I know that
and I'm sorry,

01:07:48.817 --> 01:07:50.956
but your doctor said

01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:52.218
if you're feeling upset,

01:07:52.243 --> 01:07:54.468
then you should take
your pills, not alcohol.

01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:57.410
So you relax.
I'll get them.

01:08:01.739 --> 01:08:02.713
Shit.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.515
Here we go.

01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:23.367
This'll make you feel better.

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:24.850
Drink up.

01:08:29.223 --> 01:08:31.020
Now I hope you like
what I made.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.834
It's one of my mother's
specialties.

01:08:38.049 --> 01:08:39.258
What's that?

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:40.660
Tripe.

01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:42.323
It's a delicacy.

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.165
Try it.

01:08:49.398 --> 01:08:52.363
It's like nothing
you've ever tasted.

01:08:52.894 --> 01:08:53.823
Trust me.

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:00.987
So Kevin called.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.076
He's coming home tomorrow.
I can't wait.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.103
I'm so excited.
I miss him so much.

01:09:05.127 --> 01:09:07.604
I was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.538
What do you think?

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.438
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea too.

01:09:11.728 --> 01:09:13.341
I'll make reservations.

01:09:14.224 --> 01:09:16.085
It'll be so much fun.

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:18.718
Don't you just love
being girlfriends?

01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:29.158
Night-night,
sleep tight.

01:09:42.067 --> 01:09:43.941
And good morning
to you too.

01:09:46.928 --> 01:09:48.237
Ruby, is that you?

01:09:48.261 --> 01:09:49.173
In here!

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.453
Oh my God.
Is she all right?

01:09:55.004 --> 01:09:56.460
I thought she went
to bed.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.070
I don't know.

01:09:58.095 --> 01:10:00.726
I haven't seen her like this
since "The View" won an Emmy.

01:10:01.728 --> 01:10:03.037
I wish I could stay and help

01:10:03.062 --> 01:10:05.270
but I have to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

01:10:10.299 --> 01:10:11.241
What?

01:10:11.892 --> 01:10:13.470
I underestimated you.

01:10:14.101 --> 01:10:15.604
You don't need a gun.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.148
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:22.384
Mm-hm.

01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:27.717
Last call!

01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:33.371
We'll see you
tomorrow night.

01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:37.185
Uh, there's a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.493
Yes, right this way.

01:10:39.449 --> 01:10:42.096
I'm so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:44.082
We did. I learned
a lot about her.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.902
So who's
the mystery guest?

01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:48.404
Oh, surprise!

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:52.833
I thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:55.685
Well, I hope you guys
forgive me. I just...

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.842
I wanted to talk
to you and Kevin together.

01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:02.481
So how are you, Mom?

01:11:02.506 --> 01:11:03.243
Fine.

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:08.446
Although I did have
a rather difficult night.

01:11:08.471 --> 01:11:11.217
Ooh, it was probably
that martini you had.

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:15.329
Mom, you're not supposed to drink alcohol
with those pills you're taking.

01:11:16.799 --> 01:11:18.817
You know, the truth is

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:20.479
I owe you an apology.

01:11:21.201 --> 01:11:23.103
You know, I was so insensitive
to your feelings

01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:25.222
about wanting to help
with the wedding.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.134
Oh,

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.718
it's ancient history.

01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:30.282
A young bride doesn't want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

01:11:30.307 --> 01:11:32.439
No no,
that is not true.

01:11:32.464 --> 01:11:34.377
I mean, you're gonna be my mom soon.

01:11:36.676 --> 01:11:39.379
And a grandma shortly
after, hopefully.

01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:45.313
And I want you to know
that I will do anything it takes

01:11:45.338 --> 01:11:47.157
to make this relationship work.

01:11:49.754 --> 01:11:51.500
That said...

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.651
will you be my maid...

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:56.188
I mean, my matron of honor?

01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:58.051
Charlie, that's...

01:11:58.076 --> 01:11:59.152
that's amazing.

01:11:59.177 --> 01:12:01.192
- Mom, what do you say?
- But, uh...

01:12:01.736 --> 01:12:03.598
Morgan is gonna be
your maid of honor.

01:12:03.623 --> 01:12:06.766
Oh no, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

01:12:08.356 --> 01:12:09.712
And I had this
specially made up.

01:12:09.737 --> 01:12:12.728
A dress in your
favorite color, peach.

01:12:14.135 --> 01:12:15.238
Come on, open it.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.005
Well, that's...

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.379
Char... ah.

01:12:23.393 --> 01:12:25.105
I don't think I can.

01:12:25.405 --> 01:12:26.804
Mom, I think
it's a great idea.

01:12:26.829 --> 01:12:28.528
Well, I just don't think
I'm up to it.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:31.023
I really don't. I've got
to talk to my doctor.

01:12:31.048 --> 01:12:32.392
Oh, I called him.

01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:33.103
Yeah!

01:12:33.128 --> 01:12:34.921
And he said he thought
it was a great idea.

01:12:36.808 --> 01:12:38.351
You called my psychiatrist?

01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:39.294
Mm-hmm.

01:12:39.495 --> 01:12:41.782
In fact, we had lunch
at The lvy.

01:12:42.949 --> 01:12:43.991
Well, anyway,

01:12:44.016 --> 01:12:46.532
he said, considering, you know,
this turning point in your life,

01:12:46.557 --> 01:12:49.642
you know, losing so much
so suddenly,

01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:51.157
that being involved in the future

01:12:51.182 --> 01:12:53.703
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

01:12:53.728 --> 01:12:55.547
Careful. You know
those are strong.

01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:58.852
You know, we...

01:12:58.877 --> 01:13:00.650
are your future.

01:13:00.675 --> 01:13:02.363
And we want you
to be part of it.

01:13:02.388 --> 01:13:03.458
So...

01:13:04.793 --> 01:13:07.008
I can have a list of duties
for you tomorrow.

01:13:08.147 --> 01:13:08.923
No.

01:13:11.127 --> 01:13:12.417
Mom... no, Mom.

01:13:12.962 --> 01:13:14.034
Mom, don't cry.

01:13:15.862 --> 01:13:16.620
Here.

01:13:21.339 --> 01:13:22.066
Charlie.

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:25.369
I didn't think
I would be this emotional.

01:13:25.394 --> 01:13:26.963
Mom, here.
Can I?

01:13:30.298 --> 01:13:31.755
Thank you, baby.
I love you.

01:13:32.122 --> 01:13:33.786
- I love you too.
- I love you too!

01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:35.184
I love you too, Mom.

01:13:36.982 --> 01:13:37.666
Kevin, you know what?

01:13:37.691 --> 01:13:40.209
Why don't you give your mom and I
a moment alone?

01:13:40.234 --> 01:13:41.277
Yes, of course.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.613
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:52.363
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:54.413
Oh! Well,
I could always get liposuction.

01:13:54.438 --> 01:13:56.495
I've been meaning to ask.
Is it painful?

01:13:57.124 --> 01:13:59.195
That maid of honor bit.

01:13:59.698 --> 01:14:00.954
Priceless!

01:14:00.979 --> 01:14:02.111
Well, you know what they say?

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:05.201
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

01:14:05.226 --> 01:14:06.034
Oh!

01:14:06.059 --> 01:14:07.728
Now you listen to me.

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:09.478
This is my game now.

01:14:09.503 --> 01:14:12.511
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:14.778
and that you've decided
that you're feeling like it's time

01:14:14.803 --> 01:14:17.170
that you go on with your own life!

01:14:17.545 --> 01:14:19.942
You're moving out
of our house immediately.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:22.235
This is over!

01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:29.302
This isn't over,
not even close, girlie!

01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:31.004
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:35.270
That little bitch!

01:14:35.647 --> 01:14:37.931
Let's go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

01:14:40.097 --> 01:14:41.033
What?

01:14:41.682 --> 01:14:43.441
You know exactly what.

01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:45.257
Move!

01:14:45.282 --> 01:14:47.315
Move! Move!

01:14:48.763 --> 01:14:50.327
What's wrong with you?

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.540
I am sick.

01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:54.617
I am sick sick
sick of your shit.

01:14:54.642 --> 01:14:56.969
And I when I'm not sick,
I'm tired.

01:14:56.994 --> 01:14:59.258
I am sick and tired.

01:14:59.822 --> 01:15:01.423
What are you saying?

01:15:02.227 --> 01:15:04.110
Damn you
and your luggage!

01:15:04.135 --> 01:15:06.991
Ruby, you're not gonna leave me too,
are you?

01:15:07.681 --> 01:15:09.782
Oh, I'm leaving you.

01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:11.163
You old slut!

01:15:13.065 --> 01:15:14.000
Ruby!

01:15:17.869 --> 01:15:18.603
Ruby, please...

01:15:18.628 --> 01:15:20.286
Hey, you almost
forgot your dress!

01:15:20.311 --> 01:15:22.214
You'll have nothing
to wear to the wedding.

01:15:23.337 --> 01:15:24.338
See you, Ruby!

01:15:24.782 --> 01:15:26.759
Maybe we can get you
a matching bonnet.

01:15:26.784 --> 01:15:28.721
See you
at the rehearsal dinner!

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:37.215
Motherf...!

01:15:46.344 --> 01:15:47.943
So, how's the bride-to-be
holding up?

01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:50.529
Ooh, under the circumstances
I'd say mediocre.

01:15:50.554 --> 01:15:51.639
But she's tough.

01:15:51.664 --> 01:15:53.509
Not as tough
as the old bird.

01:15:54.463 --> 01:15:55.275
What does that mean?

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.635
For your own safety,

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.500
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.657
Hey, are you
and my mom okay?

01:16:05.682 --> 01:16:08.292
Great. Yeah, I just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

01:16:08.317 --> 01:16:10.151
but everything's
under control.

01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:11.650
Of course.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.217
Hello, everyone!

01:16:17.242 --> 01:16:19.398
Welcome
to the rehearsal dinner.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.522
My God, she looks amazing.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:25.387
I know.

01:16:25.734 --> 01:16:26.276
Oh!

01:16:27.718 --> 01:16:28.849
Father Tyson.

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:30.555
Hello, Blaire.

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.368
Hello.

01:16:32.094 --> 01:16:33.239
Kit, how are you?

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:34.144
Hello.

01:16:34.169 --> 01:16:37.313
- Oh, you are Morgan.
- Yes.

01:16:37.338 --> 01:16:40.306
I have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

01:16:40.331 --> 01:16:42.228
Oh! Oh, wow!

01:16:42.253 --> 01:16:44.968
I have a lot of friends.
You're gonna be a busy girl.

01:16:46.382 --> 01:16:48.098
And you're Remy.

01:16:48.123 --> 01:16:48.667
Yeah.

01:16:48.692 --> 01:16:51.634
Oh, I recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie's told me about you.

01:16:51.659 --> 01:16:52.490
Wow.

01:16:52.838 --> 01:16:54.187
Well, Ms. Fields,
I have to say...

01:16:54.212 --> 01:16:57.308
Oh, call me Viola.
Please, I insist.

01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:58.212
Viola.

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.511
All right, I'm gonna
go get a drink.

01:17:00.536 --> 01:17:01.376
Okay.

01:17:02.566 --> 01:17:04.583
I am such a huge fan.

01:17:04.617 --> 01:17:06.245
Oh, you sweet...

01:17:06.508 --> 01:17:07.499
Oh, l...

01:17:08.016 --> 01:17:10.436
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

01:17:11.019 --> 01:17:11.643
Oh.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:12.924
Thank you.

01:17:12.949 --> 01:17:13.943
Bye, Viola.

01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:16.244
- Goodbye.
- I like her a lot. Hi.

01:17:16.269 --> 01:17:17.258
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:20.284
You guys have a nice
little chit-chat?

01:17:20.309 --> 01:17:22.179
Oh my God. She came over
and started talking to us.

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.458
What did you want us to do?
Ignore her?

01:17:23.483 --> 01:17:24.381
Yes!

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:27.730
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:34.950
- Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.
- No.

01:17:35.341 --> 01:17:37.655
So there I was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.251
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

01:17:41.276 --> 01:17:43.098
You know the story, Kevin.
And...

01:17:43.123 --> 01:17:45.067
I said to Snoop, "Snoop,
I think your lyrics

01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:48.005
are sometimes a little sexist
and unfair to women."

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:51.441
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
"Really? I have 114 wives

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.328
and they're all
huge fans of the Dogg!"

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:02.621
Honey, would you see
who's at the door?

01:18:02.646 --> 01:18:03.444
Sure.

01:18:06.017 --> 01:18:07.675
These are delicious, Viola.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.526
Oh, Kit,
I'm glad you like it.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.714
Mm, yeah.

01:18:11.657 --> 01:18:13.624
Look who's here.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

01:18:13.948 --> 01:18:15.350
Oh my God!

01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:16.684
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:19.057
Hi! Everybody,
it's Dr. Chamberlain!

01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:20.036
Hi. Good evening.

01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:21.447
Thanks so much
for inviting me.

01:18:21.472 --> 01:18:22.557
Oh, shit!

01:18:22.896 --> 01:18:24.345
That's Dr. Chamberlain.

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:25.363
Viola's doctor.

01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:27.464
Oh, we're gonna need
another place setting.

01:18:27.489 --> 01:18:29.205
Oh, please,
let me get that.

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:30.742
And there's a chair
in the living room.

01:18:30.767 --> 01:18:31.211
Sure.

01:18:31.236 --> 01:18:32.905
Well, scootch down, you guys.

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.173
Come on, make room.

01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:36.360
Remi, you guys move down.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.268
Cheers. Thank you.

01:18:38.838 --> 01:18:39.721
Who's he?

01:18:39.746 --> 01:18:41.490
It's Viola's therapist.

01:18:41.515 --> 01:18:42.514
Move down, you guys!

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:47.830
Here's you chair, Doctor.

01:18:47.855 --> 01:18:49.135
Here. Have mine, too.

01:18:50.414 --> 01:18:51.460
Hello.

01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:51.995
Hi.

01:18:52.888 --> 01:18:53.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:57.093 --> 01:18:57.927
I'll get it.

01:18:58.686 --> 01:19:00.061
So you just got here?

01:19:00.086 --> 01:19:01.128
You expecting anyone else?

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:01.935
Mm-hmm.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.490
Hello, everybody!

01:19:03.515 --> 01:19:04.348
Fiona!

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.400
I'm so glad to see you.

01:19:06.948 --> 01:19:10.380
I just couldn't resist bringing
the happy couple a little gift.

01:19:11.609 --> 01:19:14.092
That's great. I will
get you a place setting.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.548
She's bringing a gift?

01:19:15.573 --> 01:19:16.895
I think she is the gift.

01:19:17.832 --> 01:19:19.144
What the hell's she doing here?

01:19:19.169 --> 01:19:20.843
Hey, how about some
more wine, everyone?

01:19:20.868 --> 01:19:22.220
Yeah!

01:19:22.504 --> 01:19:24.138
How much longer do
we have to stay?

01:19:24.163 --> 01:19:25.327
I have midterms tomorrow.

01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:27.866
Oh, I get it.

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:29.394
No, baby, not now, okay?

01:19:29.419 --> 01:19:30.444
It's not the time.

01:19:31.863 --> 01:19:34.437
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

01:19:34.462 --> 01:19:36.526
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

01:19:36.551 --> 01:19:38.327
Uh, now that's...

01:19:38.352 --> 01:19:39.152
That's a long story.

01:19:39.177 --> 01:19:40.651
I don't think your guests
want to hear that.

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:41.679
No, we really wanna know.

01:19:41.704 --> 01:19:43.515
I think we need
some more gravy.

01:19:49.511 --> 01:19:50.920
What is going on?

01:19:52.061 --> 01:19:52.724
What are you doing?

01:19:52.749 --> 01:19:53.724
I'm behaving.

01:19:55.443 --> 01:19:56.554
Viola, no!

01:19:56.856 --> 01:19:57.676
You can't!

01:19:57.701 --> 01:19:58.923
Charlie's allergic to nuts!

01:19:58.948 --> 01:19:59.847
Give it to me!

01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.296
Viola, you're crazy.

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:15.372
Oh, get up.

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.642
Put the gravy down
or I'm telling Kevin.

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.239
Yeah!

01:20:21.861 --> 01:20:22.704
What's the big deal?

01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:24.329
So her face swells up...

01:20:24.748 --> 01:20:26.578
swells up a little.
So what?

01:20:26.603 --> 01:20:27.590
Swells up a little?

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:29.795
Her face'll blow up like
a Macy's Day balloon.

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.878
Well, good. It'll match
the other body parts!

01:20:32.319 --> 01:20:35.129
Viola, think about
what you're doing.

01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:37.554
Come on, the girl's
getting married tomorrow!

01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:39.253
Ruby, when did you
lose your edge?

01:20:39.278 --> 01:20:40.878
Right after
you lost your mind.

01:20:42.188 --> 01:20:42.953
Come on.

01:20:42.978 --> 01:20:44.975
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.763
Come on.

01:20:46.202 --> 01:20:48.735
Viola, I think you
dislocated my vagina.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.171
Where's the...

01:20:50.196 --> 01:20:50.881
Where's the what?

01:20:50.906 --> 01:20:52.139
Gravy? More gravy?

01:20:52.164 --> 01:20:53.983
Anyone for more gravy?

01:20:54.562 --> 01:20:57.211
Oh, I am not
doing time for you!

01:20:57.236 --> 01:20:57.942
Where's the back door?

01:20:57.967 --> 01:20:58.790
Stay cool, Ruby!

01:20:58.815 --> 01:20:59.311
Stay cool!

01:20:59.336 --> 01:21:00.474
This is no time to
lose your nerve.

01:21:00.499 --> 01:21:03.025
Oh, if we get arrested
I'm gonna sing like a canary.

01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:04.992
Maybe she won't
take any gravy.

01:21:05.017 --> 01:21:06.731
That's a lot of gravy.

01:21:06.756 --> 01:21:07.579
Mmm!

01:21:08.306 --> 01:21:09.633
This gravy's delicious!

01:21:10.877 --> 01:21:12.399
You... you gotta go
stop her!

01:21:12.424 --> 01:21:13.349
Come on, stop her.
Go stop her.

01:21:13.374 --> 01:21:15.014
No, you go, you go.

01:21:15.936 --> 01:21:17.778
Why me?
You're the culprit? You go!

01:21:17.803 --> 01:21:19.360
You're my assistant.

01:21:19.385 --> 01:21:20.300
What am I supposed to do?

01:21:20.325 --> 01:21:22.894
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

01:21:22.919 --> 01:21:23.724
Yeah.

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.191
Baby, you okay?

01:21:26.683 --> 01:21:28.465
Kevin, my tongue
feels weird.

01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:29.932
I think
something's wrong!

01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:32.020
Charlie, are you okay?

01:21:32.045 --> 01:21:33.638
What are we gonna do now?

01:21:33.663 --> 01:21:34.947
Hide the damn nuts!

01:21:38.039 --> 01:21:38.948
Are you all right?

01:21:38.973 --> 01:21:40.006
Get her some water.

01:21:44.263 --> 01:21:45.573
Flat or sparkling?

01:21:47.386 --> 01:21:49.844
The caterer says he doesn't know how
this could have happened.

01:21:50.204 --> 01:21:52.757
Well, I feel like I ate
a loaf of nuts.

01:21:53.052 --> 01:21:55.069
I mean, even my tongue
is swollen.

01:21:56.717 --> 01:22:01.325
You're marrying a big, fat,
puffy tomato mouth.

01:22:03.094 --> 01:22:05.618
It's not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling's already going down.

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.104
- Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

01:22:08.129 --> 01:22:08.760
Yeah.

01:22:08.785 --> 01:22:10.413
Just coming to
check up on the bride-to-be.

01:22:10.438 --> 01:22:11.772
For the love of God...

01:22:11.797 --> 01:22:12.574
Out!

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:13.614
You see?

01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:15.944
I told you it looks terrible.

01:22:15.969 --> 01:22:16.912
I told you.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:17.929
Baby, I promise you.

01:22:17.954 --> 01:22:20.512
In 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

01:22:21.298 --> 01:22:22.281
Give me that!

01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:48.840
The door was open.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.891
Oh thank God.

01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:54.284
The bride of Frankenstein is gone.

01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:55.189
I know.

01:22:55.214 --> 01:22:56.841
I was up half
the night worrying.

01:22:56.866 --> 01:22:57.628
I know.

01:22:57.652 --> 01:22:58.589
You look great.

01:22:58.614 --> 01:23:00.335
I just don't know how
those nuts got in there.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.300
Yeah.

01:23:01.545 --> 01:23:02.431
Hmm.

01:23:03.036 --> 01:23:03.979
Wait.

01:23:04.296 --> 01:23:06.125
Do you think
she would...

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.805
No!

01:23:10.316 --> 01:23:11.194
Come on.

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.834
I mean, she's crazy,

01:23:12.859 --> 01:23:15.985
but she's not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.915
Hmm.

01:23:19.697 --> 01:23:20.720
No!

01:23:22.758 --> 01:23:25.692
Oh, hey, I was wondering.
Could I bring a date

01:23:25.717 --> 01:23:27.068
to your wedding?

01:23:27.533 --> 01:23:28.803
Of course.

01:23:29.303 --> 01:23:30.715
My God. How exciting.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.149
Great. Thanks.
So then, I'll see you later.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.546
Wait!

01:23:34.571 --> 01:23:35.573
Who is he? Tell me!

01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:36.371
Oh, it's...

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:38.276
Um, okay, don't be mad.

01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:39.817
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

01:23:39.842 --> 01:23:41.284
Actually "Paul."

01:23:42.086 --> 01:23:43.143
Is that his real name?

01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:44.399
That's very funny.

01:23:44.424 --> 01:23:46.844
I gotta go get a mani, pedi
and get my eyebrows waxed.

01:23:46.869 --> 01:23:48.574
But I'll see you in
a couple of hours, okay?

01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:49.850
Oh, let me go down with you.

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:50.657
Okay.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.297
Ugh, God!

01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.689
She added
even more ruffles!

01:24:00.009 --> 01:24:02.211
Where's your prom date,
señorita?

01:24:03.751 --> 01:24:06.188
Oh, wait a minute.
This is too damn good.

01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:08.530
Where's my camera?
This is just too good.

01:24:08.555 --> 01:24:11.456
Will you just get me
out of this right now?

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.555
Come here.

01:24:31.078 --> 01:24:31.956
Cheers.

01:24:32.344 --> 01:24:33.095
Hey.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:36.337
Thanks for coming.

01:24:36.743 --> 01:24:38.744
Okay, guys, let's go see
how Charlie's doing.

01:24:39.054 --> 01:24:40.485
Ah, yes, please.

01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:41.393
Uh-huh.

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:43.536
Oh my God.

01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:45.281
Those are so much better than mine.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.156
Don't... touch me!

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:57.403
I got out of that car
the same way I got in it

01:24:57.428 --> 01:24:58.752
without you.

01:24:59.347 --> 01:25:00.564
Now where is she?

01:25:07.899 --> 01:25:09.964
You here with the bride
or the groom?

01:25:09.989 --> 01:25:11.922
I'm here with my mother.

01:25:11.947 --> 01:25:12.702
Oh.

01:25:17.343 --> 01:25:18.990
She looked a lot older. I...

01:25:22.642 --> 01:25:24.818
Well, look
what we have here.

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:27.048
Oh my God.

01:25:27.603 --> 01:25:29.884
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:31.200
Oh my God.

01:25:31.225 --> 01:25:32.106
This is it!

01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:32.944
Yeah!

01:25:34.143 --> 01:25:35.892
Oh God, did you talk to the priest?

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:36.596
I talked to him.

01:25:36.621 --> 01:25:39.427
He's just gonna skip right over that whole
"if anyone should object" part.

01:25:39.452 --> 01:25:40.539
Okay.

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:44.197
You're a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:45.514
Knock knock.

01:25:46.338 --> 01:25:47.735
Look at you!

01:25:48.523 --> 01:25:51.341
And so is your
mother-in-law.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.882
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

01:25:55.309 --> 01:25:57.011
All right.
Everybody out.

01:25:57.693 --> 01:25:59.388
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

01:26:02.716 --> 01:26:03.937
No way.

01:26:04.354 --> 01:26:05.280
What?

01:26:11.677 --> 01:26:12.912
What is that?

01:26:12.937 --> 01:26:13.919
What?

01:26:13.944 --> 01:26:15.246
Where's your
bridesmaid's dress?

01:26:15.839 --> 01:26:17.641
Oh, I gave it
to Ruby's daughter.

01:26:17.889 --> 01:26:20.041
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

01:26:20.066 --> 01:26:21.635
I don't have a daughter.

01:26:21.863 --> 01:26:22.694
Oh.

01:26:24.003 --> 01:26:24.739
Rude.

01:26:27.155 --> 01:26:28.774
Take off that white dress right now

01:26:28.799 --> 01:26:30.341
or I'll take it off for you.

01:26:32.134 --> 01:26:34.494
Don't you tell me
what to do!

01:26:35.902 --> 01:26:37.428
You did not
just poke me!

01:26:37.453 --> 01:26:40.158
Don't you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

01:26:42.368 --> 01:26:43.282
Oh my God!

01:26:43.315 --> 01:26:44.616
Viola, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

01:26:47.133 --> 01:26:48.986
You don't go and slap somebody
then apologize.

01:26:49.011 --> 01:26:50.697
Get some backbone!

01:26:57.398 --> 01:26:59.463
God! This is crazy!

01:26:59.488 --> 01:27:01.029
Why don't you just
face it?

01:27:01.054 --> 01:27:03.517
I'm marrying Kevin today and there's
nothing you can do about it.

01:27:03.542 --> 01:27:04.535
You face it!

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.536
You'll never be good
enough for him!

01:27:06.917 --> 01:27:09.267
Didn't stop you
from marrying my son.

01:27:09.612 --> 01:27:11.081
Oh God, no.

01:27:11.106 --> 01:27:12.853
Well, look at you.

01:27:13.321 --> 01:27:14.644
All in white.

01:27:14.974 --> 01:27:17.554
You are so predictable.

01:27:17.579 --> 01:27:19.013
Oh, Gertrude.

01:27:19.038 --> 01:27:20.606
I didn't know you were coming.

01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.003
You didn't?

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.376
Wonder why.

01:27:23.401 --> 01:27:24.830
Oh, I know.

01:27:25.312 --> 01:27:27.554
You didn't send me
an invitation!

01:27:27.579 --> 01:27:29.126
I thought you were dead.

01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:30.766
But evil doesn't die
so easily.

01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:33.642
I heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

01:27:33.667 --> 01:27:34.172
Oh!

01:27:34.197 --> 01:27:35.381
My congratulations.

01:27:35.406 --> 01:27:36.265
Oh.

01:27:36.848 --> 01:27:38.150
Oh my God.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.201
Oh my God!

01:27:40.226 --> 01:27:42.539
These hors d'oeuvres
taste like old socks.

01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:48.540
Now, I wanna get an
up-close look at the bride.

01:27:49.068 --> 01:27:50.282
Holy Toledo!

01:27:50.815 --> 01:27:53.358
You are a stunner!

01:27:53.984 --> 01:27:55.929
My grandson
is a lucky fella.

01:27:55.954 --> 01:27:56.706
Look, what he did.

01:27:56.731 --> 01:28:01.622
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

01:28:03.053 --> 01:28:05.573
Would that my son
had been that lucky.

01:28:05.598 --> 01:28:06.827
Here we go again.

01:28:06.852 --> 01:28:07.892
What?

01:28:07.917 --> 01:28:11.183
You were a television weatherwoman
in Dubuque, Montana.

01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:13.749
You drove around
in your broken-down minivan

01:28:13.774 --> 01:28:16.889
and you drank red wine
from a box!

01:28:19.856 --> 01:28:21.061
Classy.

01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:23.173
You killed him,
you know?

01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:23.851
What?!

01:28:23.876 --> 01:28:25.102
You killed him.

01:28:25.127 --> 01:28:27.123
All the doctors agreed,

01:28:27.148 --> 01:28:30.985
my son died
of terminal disappointment!

01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:32.935
If anybody killed him,
you did.

01:28:33.622 --> 01:28:34.831
You smothered him
to death!

01:28:34.856 --> 01:28:36.578
Nobody was ever
good enough for him!

01:28:38.804 --> 01:28:40.472
My God, you look old!

01:28:43.547 --> 01:28:44.258
Fine.

01:28:44.934 --> 01:28:46.990
This woman's gonna drive me insane.

01:28:47.015 --> 01:28:50.257
Now, I'd rather not
take all the credit.

01:28:54.799 --> 01:28:55.796
You'll get over it.

01:28:58.469 --> 01:28:59.829
Okay, I love you.

01:28:59.854 --> 01:29:00.797
You're kidding.

01:29:14.857 --> 01:29:16.744
This is never gonna end, is it?

01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:20.532
I mean, that's gonna be
me and you in 30 years.

01:29:20.557 --> 01:29:22.777
We'll be doing
the exact same thing.

01:29:27.257 --> 01:29:28.456
You know what?

01:29:30.719 --> 01:29:34.016
I wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.636
But you're never gonna
let that happen.

01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:38.643
Are you?

01:29:42.049 --> 01:29:43.988
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:50.980
You win, Viola.

01:29:53.355 --> 01:29:54.543
What do you mean?

01:29:55.387 --> 01:29:56.328
The wedding's off.

01:29:58.174 --> 01:29:59.165
Bye, Ruby.

01:30:03.055 --> 01:30:06.066
I cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

01:30:06.091 --> 01:30:07.251
I know.

01:30:07.276 --> 01:30:08.581
Now that's just wrong.

01:30:08.956 --> 01:30:09.763
Thank you.

01:30:09.788 --> 01:30:11.166
You are far worse.

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:12.032
Yeah.

01:30:12.057 --> 01:30:14.774
I don't recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

01:30:14.799 --> 01:30:16.936
And I'm pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

01:30:16.961 --> 01:30:17.783
Black.

01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:19.317
Yeah, she said she was in mourning.

01:30:19.342 --> 01:30:20.156
Mm-hmm.

01:30:21.972 --> 01:30:24.075
I just want my son
to be happy.

01:30:25.309 --> 01:30:27.292
Whatever made you
think he wasn't?

01:30:36.555 --> 01:30:38.234
Hey, what are you
doing here?

01:30:38.786 --> 01:30:40.564
Don't you know it's
bad luck to see the...

01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:42.895
Charlie, what's wrong?

01:30:45.358 --> 01:30:46.357
What is it?

01:30:47.231 --> 01:30:48.480
Are you nervous?

01:30:48.505 --> 01:30:49.340
Hey.

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:54.189
Kevin, I need...

01:30:54.214 --> 01:30:55.274
Charlie,

01:30:55.848 --> 01:30:57.264
I need to talk to you.

01:30:57.289 --> 01:30:58.030
Viola, stop it!

01:30:58.055 --> 01:31:00.012
Uh, it's the flower girls.

01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:02.130
They're drunk again.

01:31:02.532 --> 01:31:03.153
What?

01:31:03.178 --> 01:31:05.016
Yeah, in the toilet.

01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:06.664
Not now, Viola, okay?

01:31:06.689 --> 01:31:08.307
It's really important.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.684
Mom, just give us a minute.
She'll be right there.

01:31:13.332 --> 01:31:14.403
Please?

01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:16.691
Charlie, what is it?

01:31:21.662 --> 01:31:22.844
I'll be right back.

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.175
What do you want, Viola?

01:31:32.007 --> 01:31:34.860
I don't want you
to walk out on this wedding.

01:31:35.519 --> 01:31:36.705
You don't?

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:38.346
No, I don't.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:41.515
What, am I supposed to believe
that you've had some epiphany?

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.056
That all of the sudden,
everything's gonna be different?

01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:46.077
It's never been
about you, Charlie.

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:47.702
It's me.

01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:49.840
I've been so afraid
of losing him.

01:31:49.865 --> 01:31:52.038
He's the only family
I've got.

01:31:53.324 --> 01:31:55.345
This is my chance
for a family, too.

01:31:57.001 --> 01:31:58.019
And I'm scared.

01:31:58.044 --> 01:31:58.766
Oh!

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:01.332
Don't blow your chance
for happiness.

01:32:01.961 --> 01:32:03.229
You've never needed
my approval.

01:32:03.254 --> 01:32:05.413
He's loved you
from the very beginning.

01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:09.368
And I promise I will
get out of the way

01:32:09.393 --> 01:32:11.156
and let the two of you
be happy.

01:32:11.969 --> 01:32:13.332
That's not what I want.

01:32:13.957 --> 01:32:16.933
I mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:18.356
I can do boundaries!

01:32:20.966 --> 01:32:23.179
I don't love boundaries
but I can do them.

01:32:23.554 --> 01:32:24.224
All right.

01:32:24.249 --> 01:32:26.865
How about the number of times
you call Kevin every day?

01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:29.004
Can we limit that to, like, one?

01:32:29.029 --> 01:32:31.960
Oh, I need at least
four minimum.

01:32:31.985 --> 01:32:33.507
He's 35 years old.

01:32:33.532 --> 01:32:34.201
Three?

01:32:34.226 --> 01:32:35.296
Two.

01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:36.075
Deal.

01:32:36.856 --> 01:32:38.810
Two long-ass calls!

01:32:39.686 --> 01:32:41.770
When Kevin and I have kids,

01:32:41.795 --> 01:32:43.691
he and I will decide
how they're raised.

01:32:43.716 --> 01:32:44.435
All right.

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.604
But you know I have raised
one wonderful boy.

01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:49.566
- And my advice could be very...
- Will be solicited when needed.

01:32:49.591 --> 01:32:52.579
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

01:32:53.079 --> 01:32:54.095
Middle name.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:54.957
Deal.

01:32:56.193 --> 01:32:57.136
What else?

01:32:57.570 --> 01:32:59.384
Holidays
and special occasions.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:01.895
Are you gonna keep
me away?

01:33:02.754 --> 01:33:06.888
You must be present
for every Christmas,

01:33:06.913 --> 01:33:08.759
Thanksgiving,

01:33:08.784 --> 01:33:10.039
birthday,

01:33:10.064 --> 01:33:11.564
school play,

01:33:11.589 --> 01:33:12.700
clarinet recital

01:33:12.725 --> 01:33:16.055
and soccer game
in our kids' lives.

01:33:17.638 --> 01:33:19.912
I want you to love them
and spoil them

01:33:19.937 --> 01:33:22.319
and teach 'em things
that Kevin and I can't.

01:33:23.744 --> 01:33:25.822
Like how to throw
a right hook for example.

01:33:29.549 --> 01:33:30.939
I want you there, Viola.

01:33:32.223 --> 01:33:34.033
I do, up front and center.

01:33:36.359 --> 01:33:38.904
On this point
I will not negotiate.

01:33:40.138 --> 01:33:42.817
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

01:33:44.472 --> 01:33:45.394
Deal?

01:33:47.807 --> 01:33:49.067
Oh...

01:33:49.092 --> 01:33:52.048
can they call me "Aunt Viola"
instead of "Grandma"?

01:33:52.484 --> 01:33:53.310
Fine.

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.502
Come on, unzip me.

01:34:07.389 --> 01:34:09.550
Viola, you don't
have to wear that dress, really.

01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:12.472
Yes, I do. Really.

01:34:17.623 --> 01:34:19.432
Kevin and Charlie!

01:34:26.148 --> 01:34:27.013
Yeah!

01:34:43.164 --> 01:34:43.955
Mom!

01:34:46.196 --> 01:34:48.347
Do you really think I'd leave without
saying goodbye?

01:34:51.343 --> 01:34:52.346
I love you, Mom.

01:34:53.393 --> 01:34:54.253
Thanks for everything.

01:34:54.278 --> 01:34:54.981
Go.

01:35:00.318 --> 01:35:02.594
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

01:35:03.933 --> 01:35:05.051
Charlie!

01:35:05.076 --> 01:35:06.793
Charlie, right here!

01:35:06.818 --> 01:35:08.072
Right here, Charlie!

01:35:27.854 --> 01:35:28.689
Shit.

01:35:29.163 --> 01:35:31.107
Oh, Hawaii! I cannot wait!

01:35:31.132 --> 01:35:32.256
I know. I can't either.

01:35:34.445 --> 01:35:35.780
Have a great
time in Hawaii!

01:35:35.805 --> 01:35:36.303
Good luck!

01:35:36.328 --> 01:35:37.715
Have fun in Hawaii!

01:35:42.697 --> 01:35:44.337
Just you and me
now, Ruby!

01:35:44.362 --> 01:35:46.689
Jesus. Who'd I kill
in a past life?

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.793
And take off
that damn dress.

01:35:50.818 --> 01:35:52.432
You look like
a giant peach cobbler.

01:35:52.457 --> 01:35:53.997
You're making me hungry.

01:35:54.455 --> 01:35:57.478
Come on, weathergirl,
I'll buy you a box of wine.
