WEBVTT

01:16.285 --> 01:18.287
You hear that?
You can poach an egg in this water.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.581
That must be where
they're loading the radioactive waste

01:20.998 --> 01:22.291
before dumping it out at sea.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.219
Make it snappy.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.471
We got 20 minutes before
the next harbor patrol.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.810
Hey!

02:35.448 --> 02:36.448
Whoa.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.851
- Who hired you?
- Think I'd tell you?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.650
Oh!

03:16.822 --> 03:19.075
Mr. Powers, it's been a long night.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.969
My clients would like
to go back to their hotel

03:20.993 --> 03:22.787
and rest a little
and think about your offer.

03:23.329 --> 03:26.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
the buy-out offer is on the table.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.792
Leave this room and I withdraw it.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.175
Powers.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.512
Amazing, the numbers
people put on their speed dial.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.723
Just wanted you to know,
tonight's boat ride has been canceled.

03:42.807 --> 03:44.850
Though your goons
are still going up the river.

03:44.934 --> 03:45.976
Wish you could join them.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.231
Sir, your eyes.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.697
My friends, perhaps you're right.

03:58.781 --> 04:00.783
It is an ungodly hour.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.868
We'll continue this negotiation tomorrow

04:02.952 --> 04:04.412
when we are refreshed.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.045
It's useless.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.464
It barely lasts a day anymore.

04:16.674 --> 04:18.717
What do I pay you people for?

04:19.385 --> 04:20.719
It's not the skin, sir.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.847
The radiation you're emitting
is getting stronger.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.307
Is that supposed to pacify me?

04:25.391 --> 04:28.185
Mr. Powers, I have a suggestion.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.896
- Who are you?
- She's new here, Mr. Powers.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.190
- You really shouldn't be...
- I'm Dr. Lake.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.650
Stephanie Lake.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.652
What's this suggestion of yours?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.947
I could use your baseline DNA
to build you a new body.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.658
Then transfer your neural patterns
into it.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.160
Dr. Lake, it's not your place to...

04:44.243 --> 04:45.661
A new body?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.956
Theoretically, it should work.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.208
Of course, I would want
to test the process first

04:51.292 --> 04:54.503
on someone who also has
systemically damaged DNA.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.547
You have someone in mind?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.389
Take a good look, Doctor.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.186
I've been like this for nearly 50 years

05:10.269 --> 05:12.271
and I haven't aged one day.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.484
I have become
what many men have dreamed of.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.819
An immortal.

05:18.903 --> 05:23.407
And yet, there hasn't been
a day, an hour, a minute

05:23.491 --> 05:25.618
I haven't thought about death.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.913
It obsesses me, even now.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.207
What if I said I could give you life?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.958
A normal life.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.167
Ah!

05:34.585 --> 05:38.506
Victor, an incredible mind like yours
deserves a body.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.562
Dr. Lake and I have taken
every precaution, Victor.

05:53.646 --> 05:56.273
- Let me assure you.
- Save your breath.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.235
I am neither afraid,
nor capable of being comforted

05:59.318 --> 06:00.861
by your banal words.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.740
Remember, there might
be some momentary discomfort.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.880
Welcome back to the living.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.760
- I don't think you should...
- Let's see what he can do.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.640
Cold.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.685
It feels cold.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.736
So, Dana, you got time
for a fizz or something?

06:42.820 --> 06:44.238
I do, but you don't.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.907
Your keeper's here.

06:53.038 --> 06:56.000
<i>Victor Fries has paid his debt
to society,</i>

06:56.125 --> 06:59.461
<i>and now, with the help of the great
medical minds of Wayne-Powers,</i>

06:59.545 --> 07:01.755
<i>he's returned to a normal life.</i>

07:01.839 --> 07:03.841
- When was this on?
- This morning.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.759
<i>My fervent hope</i>

07:05.843 --> 07:08.387
<i>is that the technology
used to help Victor</i>

07:08.470 --> 07:10.431
<i>will serve to help millions more.</i>

07:12.850 --> 07:14.977
I want you to follow Fries.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.246
Don't let him out of your sight.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.438
Why?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.231
I don't trust him.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.110
- Powers or Fries?
- Neither.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.121
Molly!

07:46.300 --> 07:47.885
Yeah, there's a menace to society.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.659
Victor Fries?

08:14.453 --> 08:16.955
How fitting that
that diseased skull of mine

08:17.039 --> 08:18.832
should be buried like this.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.127
Frankly, I couldn't think
of anything else to do with it.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.504
It was the right thing.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.342
It symbolizes the end of a life,

08:28.550 --> 08:30.219
and the beginning of a new one.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.276
Stay down!

08:56.370 --> 08:58.580
No! No! He's gotta die!

08:58.664 --> 09:00.082
The monster's gotta die!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.795
How could you save him
after what he did?

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
What he did to me.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.425
What did I do?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.260
You destroyed my life,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.429
my family.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.555
Years ago.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.014
Gone.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.392
Frozen forever.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.104
We'll let the police take care of him.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.647
No.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.524
I've done this man enough damage.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.827
No words can express my sorrow
for the pain I've caused you.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.455
I beg your forgiveness.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.081
It was another life.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.876
Though that's hardly an excuse.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.044
I can only promise you this.

09:46.128 --> 09:49.047
I will do the best I can
to make reparations

09:49.131 --> 09:51.675
to you and everyone I've ever hurt.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.767
I'm calling it
The Nora Fries foundation,

09:59.850 --> 10:01.935
named after my former wife.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.520
And you intend to fund it yourself?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.189
Before I went to prison

10:05.272 --> 10:07.983
my legitimate earnings
were put in a blind trust.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.318
After all these years,

10:09.401 --> 10:11.653
it comes to quite a significant sum.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.615
A half billion, I hear.
That's some charity.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.326
Not charity, justice.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.496
More like blood money.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.831
Come on, can't you
cut him a little slack?

10:22.915 --> 10:25.876
Like my mom said, he's just a guy
trying to put his house in order.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.754
It's a cold draft
that blows through that house.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.800
Okay, people, thank you.
That's a wrap.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.761
- Good job, Victor.
- Thank you.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.262
My, it's a little warm in here.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.639
It's the lights.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.522
And they say
we don't work hard for our money.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.398
No doubt about it.
He's reverting.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.443
Why? How? Don't you know
what this means to me?

11:34.027 --> 11:37.197
There must some kind of
mnemonic agent within the DNA.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.033
If only we could biopsy his organs
at this stage.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.702
<i>That might be doable.</i>

11:49.793 --> 11:50.961
Stephanie?

11:51.461 --> 11:52.671
Stephanie.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.759
What are you doing?
No! Please!

11:57.843 --> 11:59.094
Open the door!

11:59.177 --> 12:01.346
Please. Please.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.936
Help.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.257
Even if he ran away
like you heard,

12:53.315 --> 12:54.795
it doesn't mean he's gonna come back.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.486
He'll be back. Count on it.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.071
He lives for revenge.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.948
Not the Victor Fries I met.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.116
<i>What you met was a ghost.</i>

13:05.619 --> 13:07.537
Security's checked
every meat locker,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.957
deep freeze,
and cryogenic plant in town.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.166
No sign of him.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.918
We never should have started this.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.588
Sometimes, you find the wrong answers
before you find the right ones.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.007
That's what science is all about.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.426
And anyway, if he's still
hiding in Gotham, he's fried.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.220
What makes you so sure?

13:23.303 --> 13:26.431
We're having a heat wave, Mr. Powers.
Today it hit 70.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.851
Hey, what's going on?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.353
Where's that coming from?

13:47.536 --> 13:49.121
Oh, Fries.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.602
Fries, how...

14:12.894 --> 14:15.480
It's something
I've kept in cold storage.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.366
You have this all wrong.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.202
Do I?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.039
Victor, don't do it.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.749
Please.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.930
We were only trying to help you.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.309
Remember, there might be
some momentary discomfort.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.069
Fire!

15:43.985 --> 15:45.320
There's enough energy here

15:45.403 --> 15:47.906
to destroy the whole compound, Batman.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.699
I suggest you find a way out.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.078
Fries, think.
This can't be what you want.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.039
You'll only cause more pain,
more suffering.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.666
No.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.834
I end it.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.753
When this goes, I go, too.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.402
You had your chance.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.404
So did you.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.661
Yeah. You feel it, don't you?

16:34.744 --> 16:38.415
Right through your suit.
The heat is on, Victor.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.420
<i>Terry, I can't
maintain video link.</i>

16:43.628 --> 16:45.088
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:49.843 --> 16:52.846
"And behold,
I shall be a blight upon the land

16:52.929 --> 16:56.892
and everything I touch
shall wither and die."

17:00.896 --> 17:02.147
Batman.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.690
And who are you, sunshine?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.985
Blight Will do.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.787
Terry, there's something
hot in that room.

17:18.914 --> 17:19.998
No kidding.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.141
This guy.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.517
He's like a walking meltdown.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.436
Keep your distance.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.079
The suit will give you some protection.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.149
<i>But it's not designed
for such high levels of radiation.</i>

18:03.667 --> 18:06.753
You only got a tan
that time, Batman.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.005
Here comes the real burn.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.216
Blight!

18:23.728 --> 18:24.896
Stay where you are.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.600
You gotta get out of here, Fries.

18:34.698 --> 18:35.818
The whole place is gonna go.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.909
Believe me,

18:38.118 --> 18:39.577
you're the only one who cares.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.172
Terry, get out of there! Now!

18:54.175 --> 18:55.343
Ffles, no!

19:29.627 --> 19:31.421
Mr. Powers, thank heavens.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.465
We used an infrared scan to locate you.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.343
Not that you would
have been hard to spot without it.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.595
We also brought these.
Just in case you were cold.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.975
You are idiots.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.485
With all his injures
and that cracked helmet,

19:53.568 --> 19:54.568
no way he got out.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.488
It could've been worse.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.323
He could've blown up the whole compound

19:58.406 --> 20:00.575
like he intended, killed hundreds.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.538
Guess you were right about Fries
all along.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.165
We both were.
