01:09.033 --> 01:11.798
I'm sorry, Miss Darling,
but I have to counsel you

01:11.847 --> 01:16.620
- against undergoing this procedure.
- Why? It's safe, isn't it?

01:16.937 --> 01:18.881
For the most part, yes.

01:19.092 --> 01:20.698
But there's...

01:20.734 --> 01:22.779
always a risk with surgery.

01:23.234 --> 01:27.029
And the size of your chest is not
something that needs to be fixed.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.419
There's no reason to take on any risk

01:29.424 --> 01:32.536
- for merely cosmetic purposes.
- "Merely"?

01:32.562 --> 01:34.384
Doctor, this is not a whim.

01:34.405 --> 01:36.333
I have considered this at length.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.578
Then perhaps you should consider that

01:38.703 --> 01:42.165
you don't need to alter your body
to be a beautiful young woman.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.860
You already are.

01:44.077 --> 01:45.830
I have had to endure the curse

01:45.846 --> 01:48.450
of a large bosom since I was in school.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.038
All my friends have youthful figures.

01:51.117 --> 01:53.045
I will have the same.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.770
What exactly do you mean by risk?

01:59.802 --> 02:01.391
The other doctor assured me

02:01.412 --> 02:03.387
that the procedure was perfectly safe.

02:03.512 --> 02:05.542
It should be, but when we're dealing...

02:05.579 --> 02:08.675
I am willing to do anything
for Mirelle's happiness.

02:09.646 --> 02:11.210
What does her mother say?

02:11.263 --> 02:13.260
Her mother died some years ago.

02:13.882 --> 02:16.512
Mirelle's happiness
is my obligation now.

02:16.549 --> 02:18.857
I will pay any price to ensure that.

02:18.878 --> 02:21.070
It's not a matter of money, Mr. Darling.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.462
There are no guarantees
with any kind of surgery,

02:23.463 --> 02:26.821
- especially one involving anaesthetic.
- So is it safe or not?

02:27.017 --> 02:28.517
It is as safe as...

02:28.549 --> 02:31.665
- any operation.
- Then you shall do it.

02:35.827 --> 02:37.264
Murdoch. Where've you been?

02:37.291 --> 02:40.032
- I had some business to attend to.
- Well, don't take your hat off.

02:40.053 --> 02:41.934
There's been a fire at a
rooming house in the Ward.

02:41.939 --> 02:44.739
Crabtree's down there now.
There's a report of a body.

02:45.225 --> 02:46.693
Sir.

02:52.276 --> 02:53.866
Who is it?

02:53.893 --> 02:55.361
There's not enough of you on that side!

02:55.382 --> 02:57.384
- Get that hose in there!
- Yes, sir!

02:59.718 --> 03:01.482
The body is burned.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.447
No wallet...

03:11.614 --> 03:13.336
identification or...

03:13.389 --> 03:15.586
- calling cards.
- It doesn't seem.

03:15.711 --> 03:17.335
Sir, you wouldn't expect a chap living

03:17.351 --> 03:19.416
it, I suppose, in a
boarding house like this.

03:24.419 --> 03:27.989
He was a smoker. Likely
how the fire started.

03:32.590 --> 03:34.275
Oh, my God...

03:34.724 --> 03:36.028
Sir?

03:36.514 --> 03:38.014
Do you know these people?

03:39.429 --> 03:40.935
That's me.

03:41.009 --> 03:42.260
What?

03:42.863 --> 03:44.295
The boy?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.225
Sir...

03:46.545 --> 03:48.889
does that mean this man is...

03:49.529 --> 03:50.992
It's my father.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.987
All right, thank you.

04:02.128 --> 04:04.393
Sir... why don't you...

04:05.278 --> 04:08.124
- Why don't you sit for a moment?
- I'm fine, George.

04:08.163 --> 04:10.692
Have you spoken to the
owner of the building?

04:10.817 --> 04:14.455
Uh, no. One of the tenants seems
to think he's out of town, sir.

04:14.580 --> 04:18.394
Did any of the neighbours
know Mr. Murdoch?

04:18.684 --> 04:21.384
I gather he moved in quite recently.

04:23.252 --> 04:25.068
I suppose I should gather his things.

04:25.108 --> 04:27.368
The fire marshal doesn't want
us in there just yet, sir.

04:27.384 --> 04:28.953
He says it's too dangerous.

04:30.025 --> 04:32.143
I'll wait at the Station House, then.

04:32.217 --> 04:34.478
Notify me when it's safe to go inside.

04:35.391 --> 04:36.865
Detective? I...

04:37.509 --> 04:39.463
One thing I thought peculiar:

04:39.588 --> 04:42.205
why would your father still
be wearing his overcoat

04:42.406 --> 04:44.672
sitting at home for a drink?

04:46.203 --> 04:49.521
When you're intent on drinking,
I suppose you don't pay much mind

04:49.536 --> 04:51.379
to removing your overcoat.

04:55.874 --> 04:57.221
William.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.321
I'm so sorry.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.915
Oh. Thank you, but really...

05:03.834 --> 05:06.153
I know the two of you weren't close,

05:06.491 --> 05:08.609
but it's never easy to lose a parent.

05:08.825 --> 05:10.378
I suppose not.

05:10.563 --> 05:13.495
But I haven't found it
to be difficult either.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.997
I should notify Jasper.

05:21.486 --> 05:24.008
Julia, I assure you I'm quite all right.

05:24.529 --> 05:26.467
This is your father, William.

05:26.985 --> 05:29.056
I'm sure no one will find it unusual

05:29.072 --> 05:31.132
if you don't finish
your paperwork today.

05:31.417 --> 05:34.840
No. But there's no reason
to postpone it, either.

05:36.213 --> 05:38.875
Julia, thank you for coming down here

05:38.912 --> 05:41.817
but I assure you, I'm not being cold.

05:41.986 --> 05:44.680
Obviously I'm not happy
the man is dead, but...

05:45.129 --> 05:47.279
there's nothing I can do for him now.

05:50.871 --> 05:52.846
I'll take care of the coroner's report.

05:52.971 --> 05:54.642
That's not necessary.

05:54.684 --> 05:56.684
- Miss Hart is capable.
- Detective Murdoch.

06:09.785 --> 06:11.639
Sir. This duffel...

06:11.718 --> 06:13.859
it's badly burned, but I
believe this is the type

06:13.870 --> 06:15.848
they give the men when
they're released from the Don.

06:15.872 --> 06:19.517
Harry Murdoch was known to run
afoul of the law from time to time.

06:21.398 --> 06:24.441
- What's that?
- A stack of handbills.

06:24.566 --> 06:27.657
God... heaven... salvation.

06:27.690 --> 06:31.042
I did not know my father
to be a God-fearing man.

06:31.143 --> 06:34.860
Perhaps he found some form of
peace at the end of his life.

06:37.046 --> 06:40.948
It doesn't seem to specify
any church in particular.

06:41.390 --> 06:43.173
Well, that's odd...

06:43.397 --> 06:45.325
There's another overcoat here.

06:45.378 --> 06:47.273
But he was wearing his.

06:48.138 --> 06:51.945
Why would a man living in such a
place as this have two overcoats?

06:59.485 --> 07:01.755
It doesn't fit.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.859
This may not have been his place.

07:07.018 --> 07:09.249
Sir, I spoke to the neighbours again,

07:09.276 --> 07:12.498
no one remembers even seeing
the man who rented the room.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.951
Well, perhaps the real tenant
was recently released from jail,

07:15.984 --> 07:18.327
and he let Harry use his room

07:18.354 --> 07:21.529
- for a few days while he was out of town.
- Without his duffel?

07:22.117 --> 07:25.514
Sir, I hesitate to say it, but
it does seem like there is some...

07:25.639 --> 07:27.833
malfeasance involved.

07:28.773 --> 07:30.490
The simplest explanation

07:30.516 --> 07:33.046
is that they were two
drunks sharing a bottle...

07:33.574 --> 07:36.569
a blaze broke out, and only
one woke out of his stupor

07:36.585 --> 07:37.953
in time to escape the fire.

07:38.005 --> 07:39.722
And the other chap is
nowhere to be found.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.782
I mean, surely it's a tad suspicious.

07:41.808 --> 07:44.819
It is unusual, but we won't know
anything until we find that man.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.440
There is some good news on that front.

07:46.451 --> 07:49.160
The lads have found the building's
landlord. They're bringing him

07:49.186 --> 07:51.162
- to the Station House now.
- Very good.

07:52.086 --> 07:54.315
Nelson. Nelson was his name.

07:54.326 --> 07:56.745
Is that his Christian name or surname?

07:56.750 --> 07:59.064
I just ask for their money,
not their life's story.

07:59.101 --> 08:00.770
When did he first take the room?

08:00.828 --> 08:04.123
Thursday last week.
Wednesday maybe. About then.

08:04.224 --> 08:05.725
Where did he come from?

08:05.850 --> 08:07.737
As I say, I don't ask these things.

08:07.785 --> 08:09.248
What did he look like?

08:09.373 --> 08:11.731
Older fellow. 60s maybe.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.318
Grey hair, unkempt. Long hair for a man.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.945
And did he tell you where
he'd previously been staying?

08:16.960 --> 08:18.563
You can usually make
a guess on that front.

08:18.587 --> 08:21.244
Most of the men I get come from the Don.

08:21.418 --> 08:25.342
We have a name, "Nelson", and a
description. But no sign of him yet.

08:25.385 --> 08:27.701
He could know something
about your father's death.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.046
He may have been
present during the fire.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.052
Well, we need to find him.

08:32.602 --> 08:35.601
Well, sir, even if he
does know something,

08:35.634 --> 08:38.491
what would it matter? No
crime has been committed.

08:38.554 --> 08:41.423
This was likely the last man
that saw your father alive.

08:41.486 --> 08:42.971
You don't want to talk to him?

08:43.288 --> 08:45.585
Frankly, sir, I don't
see what good it could do.

08:45.644 --> 08:49.457
Sirs. I've traced the key

08:49.479 --> 08:52.237
to a rooming house on Queen Street.

08:52.339 --> 08:53.958
The landlord there

08:54.000 --> 08:56.504
confirmed that a chap
checked in about a week ago

08:56.556 --> 08:58.780
and gave his name as "Harry".

09:01.781 --> 09:03.716
Fine work, George.

09:03.817 --> 09:06.748
I suppose I'll settle his
bill and gather his things.

09:37.887 --> 09:40.523
Hello?

09:41.131 --> 09:43.164
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

09:43.464 --> 09:46.564
I'm looking for Harry
Murdoch. Does he not live here?

09:46.828 --> 09:48.894
- He did.
- What...

09:49.126 --> 09:50.937
But he telephoned me only yesterday.

09:50.969 --> 09:54.332
He can't have moved on already.
Are you a friend of his?

09:54.697 --> 09:56.582
I'm a police detective.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.072
Oh, no.

09:58.605 --> 10:00.628
Has something happened to Harry?

10:00.753 --> 10:03.417
I'm afraid he died yesterday evening.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.287
No...

10:06.146 --> 10:07.532
Well...

10:08.165 --> 10:10.950
This... this can't be.

10:11.008 --> 10:14.119
We were supposed to see one another...

10:14.589 --> 10:16.940
catch up after all these years.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.209
Had you known him long?

10:20.457 --> 10:21.820
Yes!

10:21.862 --> 10:24.556
I... I hadn't seen him recently, but...

10:25.153 --> 10:27.350
but we used to be close.

10:27.883 --> 10:30.202
Oh, I can't believe this. What happened?

10:30.983 --> 10:32.811
There was a fire.

10:32.922 --> 10:35.378
Oh... Harry.

10:35.737 --> 10:39.054
Oh, he was such a kind soul.

10:44.017 --> 10:45.918
Wait...

10:46.019 --> 10:48.118
You're a police detective.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.866
You're his son, aren't you?

10:53.690 --> 10:55.127
I am.

10:55.159 --> 10:56.738
William.

10:58.587 --> 11:01.418
- He mentioned me?
- Yes, of course. But...

11:01.543 --> 11:03.510
I know you, dear.

11:03.542 --> 11:06.230
Susan Kelly. Don't you remember me?

11:08.364 --> 11:11.718
I even took care of you while he
was working, don't you remember?

11:11.892 --> 11:15.011
I don't remember much from that time.

11:17.163 --> 11:21.765
Well, we have to tell everyone. I'm
sure he has friends in the city...

11:22.790 --> 11:25.110
Yes, I'm planning a small service

11:25.157 --> 11:27.659
in a day or two at St. Paul's.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.063
You can inquire as to the
particulars from the Station House.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.065
Good day, Miss Kelly.

11:35.399 --> 11:37.321
It was difficult to get many details

11:37.363 --> 11:39.838
because of how badly
burned the body was.

11:39.939 --> 11:43.028
However, I believe the victim
was involved in an altercation.

11:43.778 --> 11:45.210
A fight?

11:45.944 --> 11:47.333
Someone attacked him.

11:47.365 --> 11:50.090
Whether or not he fought
back, I can't tell.

11:50.386 --> 11:53.560
What kind of altercation? How severe?

11:53.685 --> 11:55.689
His hyoid bone is broken.

11:55.814 --> 11:58.423
All other evidence has been burned away.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.708
- He was strangled.
- Yes.

12:02.740 --> 12:04.335
There was no smoke in his lungs, so

12:04.382 --> 12:07.399
I believe it happened shortly
before the fire broke out.

12:09.273 --> 12:11.154
I'm sorry, Detective.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.417
So, we have a murder
investigation on our hands.

12:24.451 --> 12:26.833
And this fellow Nelson
is our prime suspect.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.047
It would appear that
he murdered my father,

12:29.079 --> 12:31.815
then set the building on fire
to cover up his actions...

12:31.840 --> 12:34.280
which would explain why he
vanished without a trace.

12:34.476 --> 12:36.942
Murdoch. You don't have
to do this, you know.

12:37.851 --> 12:40.482
Are you questioning my
ability to remain impartial?

12:40.503 --> 12:42.569
No. But it would be
more than understandable

12:42.595 --> 12:45.337
- if you wanted to sit this one out.
- I don't.

12:45.612 --> 12:46.816
Good man.

12:53.649 --> 12:57.346
I will not be performing the
breast reduction on Mirelle Darling.

12:57.471 --> 12:59.413
She is your patient.

12:59.538 --> 13:01.975
I believe the procedure is unnecessary.

13:02.002 --> 13:03.969
It's not unnecessary
in the patient's view.

13:03.995 --> 13:05.976
No, but it is in mine.

13:10.597 --> 13:12.281
What would you propose?

13:12.499 --> 13:13.932
We say no,

13:13.945 --> 13:16.850
they go to another hospital
and have it done there?

13:16.975 --> 13:19.148
Or a private practice maybe,

13:19.167 --> 13:21.326
to be butchered by some sawbones?

13:21.451 --> 13:24.608
Well, if all doctors of good
conscience refuse to do it,

13:24.641 --> 13:26.734
then perhaps the
patient will reconsider.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.170
These people have money.
They'll get what they want.

13:29.295 --> 13:31.409
And we can provide the best surgeon

13:31.442 --> 13:33.013
and the highest level of safety.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.298
This procedure goes against everything

13:35.311 --> 13:36.982
we're striving to do in this profession.

13:38.659 --> 13:40.507
You may feel that way.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.300
But to deny this operation is to
put the patient at greater risk.

13:44.315 --> 13:47.263
- And if something goes wrong?
- That won't happen.

13:47.388 --> 13:50.231
You can't be certain of that,
that's entirely my point.

13:50.252 --> 13:54.001
That won't happen because you
will not be performing the surgery.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.257
If you can't handle the
responsibilities of this kind of surgery,

13:57.290 --> 14:00.070
I will undertake it myself.

14:03.212 --> 14:05.424
- Did you find him? Nelson?
- Sir, no.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.464
But Station House Two received a report

14:07.477 --> 14:08.758
of a break-in on Markham Street.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.264
The burglar was described as a man

14:10.304 --> 14:12.879
- in his 60s with grey hair.
- Could be him.

14:12.899 --> 14:14.642
- I'll inform the detective.
- No.

14:14.675 --> 14:16.847
Maybe we should handle this on our own.

14:16.893 --> 14:18.332
We can't be sure it's him yet.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.413
William, thank you for seeing us.

14:20.429 --> 14:23.034
I was so... saddened
upon hearing about Harry

14:23.044 --> 14:26.361
that I went out straight away and
found another of his old friends.

14:26.486 --> 14:28.094
Leonard Vasser.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.159
Detective William Murdoch.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.773
- Pleased.
- We were thinking...

14:32.898 --> 14:35.773
it might be nice to do something
to honour your father's memory.

14:35.853 --> 14:38.050
- Such as?
- Oh...

14:38.129 --> 14:40.057
a gathering of some sort?

14:40.110 --> 14:42.878
A wake? He did love a party.

14:43.512 --> 14:44.991
It's... it's a...

14:45.049 --> 14:47.310
it's a hard thing to lose someone.

14:47.331 --> 14:49.186
all you want to do is, uh...

14:49.239 --> 14:51.743
share in whatever
memories are left to you.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.294
I believe the funeral
will be sufficient.

14:54.569 --> 14:57.686
Had you also known my father
a long time, Mr. Vasser?

14:57.860 --> 14:59.936
Leonard, please.

14:59.978 --> 15:04.646
I... knew your father
as long as Susan here.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.564
I shared a drink with
him only yesterday.

15:07.591 --> 15:11.282
- What time was that?
- It was early. About two o'clock.

15:11.314 --> 15:13.759
He died just a few hours later.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.521
Oh. Lordy, lordy...

15:16.701 --> 15:18.428
Did he seem at all...

15:18.553 --> 15:20.884
agitated or anything of the sort?

15:21.009 --> 15:22.748
No, no.

15:22.991 --> 15:24.781
Why would you ask that?

15:25.426 --> 15:27.454
Well, I regret to
inform the both of you,

15:27.459 --> 15:29.773
that Harry Murdoch did
not die as the result

15:29.804 --> 15:31.331
of an accidental fire.

15:31.394 --> 15:32.694
He was murdered.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.272
- No...
- How is that possible?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.031
- He would never...
- Oh!

15:37.052 --> 15:40.009
He was a friend to all he met.

15:40.041 --> 15:43.041
So you knew of no one who
may have wished him harm?

15:43.078 --> 15:46.147
- Or held a grudge?
- I can't imagine...

15:46.168 --> 15:48.376
You must find out who did this, William.

15:48.501 --> 15:51.704
Yes. In fact, I should
see to that presently.

15:52.903 --> 15:55.494
Oh, one more thing.

15:55.529 --> 15:58.677
Do either of you know a man named Nelson

15:58.714 --> 16:00.604
who may have known my father?

16:02.743 --> 16:04.961
No. I can't say that I do.

16:04.967 --> 16:06.937
William.

16:07.062 --> 16:08.828
Pardon the interruption.

16:08.859 --> 16:10.591
Of course. These folks were just...

16:10.613 --> 16:13.602
Dr. Julia Ogden. I'm William's wife.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.328
Leonard Vasser. This is Susan Kelly.

16:16.359 --> 16:18.092
Old friends of Harry's.

16:18.118 --> 16:21.271
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Well, it's been hard,

16:21.396 --> 16:23.122
but Harry would have been so pleased

16:23.141 --> 16:26.785
to see what a wonderful
woman his son married.

16:27.535 --> 16:30.935
As I said, I'll send word as
soon as arrangements are made.

16:30.945 --> 16:33.332
William, I was just
going to suggest lunch.

16:33.344 --> 16:36.751
Perhaps we should
invite Leonard and Susan?

16:37.063 --> 16:39.809
It will give you all
a chance to reminisce.

16:42.433 --> 16:45.186
I came from the grocer's
and I heard someone inside.

16:45.236 --> 16:47.279
I thought it was my nephew Timothy.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.749
But it wasn't Timothy.
It was an old man.

16:49.766 --> 16:51.884
His hair was grey? Unkempt?

16:51.905 --> 16:54.435
Exactly. When I saw
him, I started screaming.

16:54.456 --> 16:56.389
- And then he ran off?
- Once I grabbed hold

16:56.426 --> 16:58.829
of that fireplace poker, he sure did.

16:59.014 --> 17:01.184
I put the fear of God
in that old fellow.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.171
I don't doubt it.

17:03.487 --> 17:06.022
- Was anything taken?
- Not a thing.

17:07.607 --> 17:09.371
I stopped him in time.

17:09.746 --> 17:11.994
But he did try to get my sideboard.

17:12.318 --> 17:14.230
He was trying to steal your sideboard?

17:14.457 --> 17:17.885
Obviously. He dragged
it across the room.

17:18.301 --> 17:20.373
Did you have something valuable in it?

17:20.748 --> 17:23.421
No. It's valuable.

17:23.906 --> 17:25.755
It's a sideboard.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.299
Yes, of course. Do you mind
if we have a quick look?

17:29.489 --> 17:31.142
Be my guest.

17:31.855 --> 17:33.397
Excuse me.

17:34.852 --> 17:36.786
This thing is bloody worthless.

17:36.887 --> 17:39.419
I can't believe he wanted to steal this.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.892
Maybe he was trying to get behind it.

17:54.004 --> 17:55.562
Sir.

17:57.030 --> 17:59.746
He wasn't dragging this
to look behind it...

18:01.878 --> 18:03.839
he was trying to reach something.

18:31.661 --> 18:33.265
It's a small fortune.

18:36.369 --> 18:38.759
It was a summer storm
like I'd never seen

18:38.782 --> 18:41.631
and the rain was just pouring
through a hole in the roof.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.017
And your father came over

18:43.044 --> 18:45.352
and went right out through
the thunder and the lightning,

18:45.368 --> 18:47.523
and climbed up there and
started hammering away.

18:47.549 --> 18:50.317
Well, after a minute or
two, the whole thing gave way

18:50.354 --> 18:52.842
and he came tumbling down
right into the living room!

18:52.863 --> 18:54.416
Oh!

18:56.575 --> 19:00.363
The man was soaked
through. Boy, was he angry.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.006
But once he stopped
cursing a blue streak,

19:03.278 --> 19:05.814
he found some wood; he went
right back up there again

19:05.829 --> 19:08.808
and patched the thing up. Nothing
in the world would have stopped him.

19:09.569 --> 19:11.840
Well, he certainly was stubborn.

19:14.476 --> 19:16.890
Leonard spent a lot of
time with us that summer.

19:16.933 --> 19:20.287
- So you knew William as a boy.
- I did. I did.

19:20.651 --> 19:23.825
I can't say that I'd have
recognized you, William,

19:24.036 --> 19:26.492
but I was around in those days, and...

19:26.983 --> 19:29.599
I remember how you admired your father.

19:32.007 --> 19:34.172
Well, that was a long time ago.

19:35.429 --> 19:38.333
Still, he cared for you.

19:38.956 --> 19:42.267
He was so proud you'd
become a policeman.

19:43.514 --> 19:47.703
Well, if all of that is true, it
wasn't a feeling he shared with me...

19:48.057 --> 19:49.557
or my brother.

19:51.284 --> 19:53.967
But the most important thing
about my father's death right now

19:53.993 --> 19:55.826
is that his killer be found.

19:56.407 --> 19:58.546
So, if you'll excuse me.

20:01.759 --> 20:04.430
Sirs! I spoke to the
woman who owns the house,

20:04.454 --> 20:06.567
she had no idea anything
was hidden in the clock.

20:06.837 --> 20:09.837
So, an acquaintance just stopped
by and stuck $500 in there?

20:09.874 --> 20:12.436
Well she said the clock
was there when she moved in.

20:12.457 --> 20:14.475
So, I went and spoke
to Property Records.

20:14.538 --> 20:19.101
I found out that a previous
owner was a Mrs. Elizabeth Nelson.

20:19.149 --> 20:20.438
"Nelson".

20:21.019 --> 20:23.660
- When did she sell the house?
- 1886. But sirs,

20:23.687 --> 20:26.689
I have a feeling the truth stretches
back even further than that.

20:26.713 --> 20:28.335
- Why's that?
- Sir,

20:28.356 --> 20:31.793
these notes were issued by the
First Dominion Bank of Toronto.

20:31.829 --> 20:33.885
Now, they've been closed since 1878.

20:33.906 --> 20:35.126
Nearly 30 years ago.

20:35.132 --> 20:37.451
Right, that's when they were
bought out by Toronto Imperial.

20:37.475 --> 20:39.373
So, I went in and had
a visit with Imperial.

20:39.403 --> 20:41.723
They said when they took
over from First Dominion,

20:41.739 --> 20:43.935
all the Dominion notes were exchanged.

20:44.014 --> 20:47.021
Maybe someone who collected them
for the bank decided to keep them.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.766
Usually the bank would
destroy the notes.

20:49.787 --> 20:51.556
Presumably, they would track the numbers

20:51.578 --> 20:53.923
to ensure that they didn't
buy back the same note twice.

20:53.971 --> 20:56.801
Yes, exactly, sir. That's
just what they did. However...

20:57.562 --> 20:59.965
not all the bills were bought back.

21:00.577 --> 21:03.419
- Lost or forgotten presumably.
- Here.

21:03.544 --> 21:06.741
This $10 bill was never
returned. In fact...

21:07.534 --> 21:11.981
there's a whole sequence of 10s
here that are marked as illicit.

21:13.824 --> 21:16.339
These serial numbers
are all in sequence.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.437
- Stolen?
- Not stolen, sir.

21:20.562 --> 21:23.548
It says here it was
used to pay a ransom.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.617
It was a kidnapping. 1870.

21:32.633 --> 21:35.134
A very wealthy family, the Penhursts,

21:35.163 --> 21:36.969
had their infant son taken.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.995
They paid a $2000 ransom, but...

21:39.415 --> 21:42.498
the child was never
returned. Never seen again.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.636
And the notes were
from the Dominion bank?

21:46.217 --> 21:49.205
Sir, the serial numbers were
noted. It's the same money.

21:49.306 --> 21:51.003
Nelson must have been involved.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.193
If he's over 60 now, he would
have been a young man in 1870.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.538
He must have hidden the
bank notes all these years,

21:56.547 --> 21:58.625
thinking he'd go back to
them in case of an emergency.

21:58.649 --> 22:01.655
An emergency as in... he
killed a man and had to flee?

22:02.642 --> 22:05.193
The house where the money
was hidden... where is it?

22:05.236 --> 22:06.594
Markham Street.

22:06.953 --> 22:08.337
"Markham Street"...

22:15.557 --> 22:17.083
I was here.

22:17.421 --> 22:20.416
It was the summer I visited my father.

22:20.471 --> 22:22.856
It would have been 1870.

22:23.474 --> 22:25.787
The same year the
Penhurst child was taken.

22:26.241 --> 22:29.295
There's no proof that your
father had anything to do with it.

22:29.802 --> 22:33.557
He was here and he knew the
man that was after the money.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.185
There's no use in pretending otherwise.

22:36.726 --> 22:39.489
My father was involved
in that kidnapping.

22:46.903 --> 22:50.764
The kidnapping of a child
is a serious crime, William.

22:50.889 --> 22:53.526
How can you be sure
your father was involved?

22:53.527 --> 22:55.771
He was staying with
a friend that summer.

22:55.819 --> 22:57.835
At the house from the photograph.

22:57.936 --> 23:00.740
And this friend is the man
that may have killed him?

23:01.353 --> 23:02.889
I knew him as Danny.

23:02.926 --> 23:06.201
We looked into the previous
owner, Elizabeth Nelson,

23:06.212 --> 23:08.842
and she had a son named Daniel.

23:09.401 --> 23:11.615
So he was staying with this man,

23:11.740 --> 23:14.618
and you think he helped
him with the kidnapping?

23:15.470 --> 23:17.715
It explains almost everything.

23:17.778 --> 23:19.880
There was money left
over from the ransom.

23:19.925 --> 23:21.401
Perhaps Harry wanted it, or

23:21.423 --> 23:23.350
perhaps he was blackmailing Nelson.

23:23.852 --> 23:26.181
You're ready to believe
the worst of him.

23:26.704 --> 23:30.270
It could have been merely an
altercation between two old friends.

23:30.555 --> 23:32.412
But these were two old friends

23:32.456 --> 23:34.416
who committed a heinous crime together.

23:34.431 --> 23:36.159
You don't know what happened.

23:36.497 --> 23:38.689
The child was never seen again.

23:41.932 --> 23:44.763
I was actually starting to
feel something for the man.

23:45.085 --> 23:49.555
Not... grief, but something.

23:50.685 --> 23:52.640
He had friends who cared about him.

23:52.671 --> 23:55.269
Perhaps he had some redeeming qualities.

23:55.755 --> 23:57.705
I'm sure he did.

23:58.714 --> 24:00.668
Now he's left me with this.

24:01.487 --> 24:05.532
His only legacy is an
obligation to right his wrongs.

24:11.701 --> 24:14.765
Sirs? I've looked into Daniel Nelson.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.115
He's been in and out of
the Don Jail for decades.

24:17.136 --> 24:20.892
But nothing more than petty
theft or drunken fistfights.

24:21.113 --> 24:23.897
- What about the kidnapping?
- That's where it gets interesting, sir.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.582
For the year leading
up to the kidnapping,

24:25.603 --> 24:27.774
he worked for the Penhurst
family as a gardener.

24:27.899 --> 24:29.770
Now, he was questioned
by the police of course,

24:29.792 --> 24:31.829
but exonerated thanks to an alibi.

24:31.842 --> 24:35.166
- How strong was the alibi?
- I imagine he had a very good one.

24:35.487 --> 24:38.682
Mr. Nelson had an alibi
because he had an accomplice:

24:38.741 --> 24:40.103
Harry Murdoch.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.538
Sir, I'm very sorry.
It must be difficult

24:45.574 --> 24:47.202
to learn such a thing of your father.

24:47.446 --> 24:50.360
Yes, well, it's too late to
bring Harry Murdoch to justice.

24:50.788 --> 24:52.683
Mr. Nelson remains at large.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.987
He kidnapped a child over 30 years ago

24:55.020 --> 24:56.887
and, very likely, killed my father.

24:57.012 --> 24:58.885
Well, the lads are
combing the streets now

24:58.890 --> 25:00.459
for anybody matching his description.

25:00.475 --> 25:02.587
There must be someone
who knows where he's gone.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.785
Just got out of jail, didn't he?

25:04.816 --> 25:06.608
Sir. Less than two weeks ago.

25:06.660 --> 25:09.143
Well, he would have spent
time with someone in there.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.371
The surgery was successful.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.079
I'm glad.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.744
I hope you understand
why I asked to step aside.

25:26.001 --> 25:29.689
I do. In your situation,
I may have done the same.

25:29.937 --> 25:32.605
But I have a hospital to think about.

25:32.985 --> 25:36.176
Procedures that bring
in fees and donations

25:36.229 --> 25:38.542
they pay for more than themselves.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.831
They help us save lives.

25:42.556 --> 25:44.410
Well, if this surgery allows for that,

25:44.431 --> 25:46.972
then perhaps the small
risk is worth taking.

25:47.205 --> 25:49.762
- Indeed.
- Doctor?

25:50.005 --> 25:51.780
The patient is feverish.

25:51.796 --> 25:53.587
- Heart rate?
- 105.

25:53.608 --> 25:55.815
And she's having difficulty breathing.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.457
I believe it may be sepsis.

26:04.399 --> 26:07.267
You were a cell mate of Daniel Nelson's?

26:07.459 --> 26:08.889
Yes.

26:09.014 --> 26:11.751
Do you know where he planned
to go upon his release?

26:11.978 --> 26:14.725
- He was on the path.
- The path?

26:15.190 --> 26:16.867
To salvation.

26:17.936 --> 26:20.914
- He was religious?
- He had seen the light.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.668
I had shown him.

26:22.890 --> 26:25.842
- You are a Christian?
- I am a Christadelphian.

26:26.211 --> 26:30.114
Repentance is the way to
reconciliation with God.

26:31.494 --> 26:34.658
- And Nelson believed this as well?
- Of course.

26:35.171 --> 26:36.988
He was in Christ.

26:41.425 --> 26:45.072
Is this part of the
teachings of your church?

26:45.726 --> 26:48.578
This is the statement of our faith.

26:50.797 --> 26:52.970
This was the work of my Daniel?

26:53.271 --> 26:56.273
A stack of these was
found in his room, yes.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.786
He was spreading the word.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.679
He finally did it, didn't he?

27:02.103 --> 27:04.776
- Did what?
- Confess.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.067
So, what did you learn
about Daniel Nelson?

27:08.093 --> 27:09.969
His cell mate knew he had secrets

27:09.995 --> 27:12.351
he wanted to confess but
didn't know what they were.

27:12.476 --> 27:15.742
I believe he intended to turn
himself in for the kidnapping,

27:15.760 --> 27:17.995
and he urged Harry
Murdoch to do the same.

27:18.061 --> 27:20.764
That's why your father had one
of those pamphlets in his room.

27:21.019 --> 27:23.033
Which would suggest the two of them met

27:23.063 --> 27:25.308
to discuss it prior to him being killed.

27:25.525 --> 27:29.006
Clearly, Harry Murdoch
did not want to be saved.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.941
But if Nelson confessed,

27:30.971 --> 27:32.434
then they would both hang.

27:32.911 --> 27:35.947
I believe Harry went to Nelson's
apartment that night to kill him,

27:35.978 --> 27:38.038
so that his confession
would never be heard.

27:38.059 --> 27:41.387
But Nelson got the better of him,
set the place on fire and then fled.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.299
The Constables are
searching for him now.

27:44.311 --> 27:46.533
- Nothing yet.
- We'll find him.

27:46.941 --> 27:49.107
Your father will get justice.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.706
I don't know that he deserves it.

27:51.831 --> 27:53.364
Everyone does.

27:55.076 --> 27:57.410
He kidnapped a child, sir,

27:57.717 --> 27:59.640
a child that is likely dead,

27:59.682 --> 28:02.139
and evaded punishment his entire life.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.939
Where is the justice in that?

28:03.971 --> 28:06.115
You need to try to find
a way to forgive him.

28:06.578 --> 28:08.455
Why would I want to do that?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.942
My father was no saint, Murdoch.

28:10.979 --> 28:12.827
But I choose to remember
the good things about him.

28:12.832 --> 28:14.385
You should try and do the same.

28:14.781 --> 28:17.062
Sir, I am not going to trick myself

28:17.063 --> 28:19.239
into having sympathy for an awful man

28:19.276 --> 28:21.991
simply so that I can have peace of mind.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.521
No, but you'll wind up there eventually.

28:26.185 --> 28:27.631
How do you know?

28:28.942 --> 28:30.554
Because you did with your father?

28:32.344 --> 28:34.742
Or because you hope
your son will with you?

28:36.512 --> 28:38.324
What are you suggesting?

28:39.449 --> 28:41.943
A man who turns his back on his family

28:42.233 --> 28:44.246
can't simply return on a whim

28:44.282 --> 28:47.468
and expect to find forgiveness
conveniently waiting for him.

28:48.345 --> 28:50.707
I think you'd best get out of my office

28:50.749 --> 28:52.688
before you say any more.

28:53.955 --> 28:56.744
- You're angry.
- What if I am?

28:56.795 --> 29:00.430
Well, that anger comes from the
fact that you cared about him.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.598
I had simply hoped for better.

29:04.195 --> 29:06.246
You hadn't seen the man for 10 years.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.683
There's no reason to hope he'd changed.

29:09.106 --> 29:11.403
That's not entirely true.

29:11.879 --> 29:13.485
You'd spoken to him?

29:14.388 --> 29:16.924
He sent me a telegram
the day before he died.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.196
What? What did it say?

29:19.397 --> 29:21.594
That he wanted to speak to me.

29:21.615 --> 29:23.242
What about, I don't know.

29:23.850 --> 29:25.915
Then you thought he might have changed.

29:27.325 --> 29:30.673
I allowed myself to
entertain the possibility.

29:32.881 --> 29:35.828
I thought that maybe
he wanted to apologize,

29:35.867 --> 29:39.477
- or at the very least reconcile.
- Well, perhaps he did.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.694
Well, he may have considered it.

29:42.507 --> 29:45.006
But instead of meeting with his son,

29:45.259 --> 29:47.600
he drank the day away
with an old friend,

29:47.637 --> 29:50.563
then went off to kill another man.

29:51.751 --> 29:53.484
He was...

29:55.243 --> 29:57.197
He was my father.

29:57.244 --> 30:00.255
But he was worthless
until his last breath.

30:00.941 --> 30:02.732
Of course I'm angry.

30:03.941 --> 30:06.230
I'm angry and ashamed.

30:08.067 --> 30:11.457
Harry Murdoch died
attempting to kill a man.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.190
No.

30:13.385 --> 30:15.556
Not Harry! He would never...

30:16.741 --> 30:19.728
What do you recall
about the summer of 1870?

30:20.172 --> 30:22.401
That was the summer I visited.

30:23.230 --> 30:24.583
That's right...

30:24.876 --> 30:28.747
Come to think of it, he
wasn't around much that year.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.838
I figured he was taking care of you.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.918
In fact, he may have been
spending much of his time

30:33.939 --> 30:36.395
with a man named Daniel Nelson.

30:37.061 --> 30:39.707
You've mentioned him
before. Who was this man?

30:40.131 --> 30:41.550
A criminal.

30:41.675 --> 30:44.111
Someone who arranged a kidnapping.

30:44.993 --> 30:46.525
Dear God.

30:47.071 --> 30:49.477
You think that he's the
one that killed Harry?

30:50.412 --> 30:52.272
Likely in self defense.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.749
Well, you must find him. You
must to bring him to justice.

30:54.802 --> 30:56.465
It's your duty.

30:56.590 --> 30:58.108
Sir.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.750
The lads have found something.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.671
- Over there.
- Right. Thank you.

31:03.590 --> 31:06.136
- Mr. Nelson is here?
- Sir, the minister says

31:06.173 --> 31:08.111
he's been here the last two days.

31:12.564 --> 31:13.799
Hello.

31:13.924 --> 31:18.067
Detective William Murdoch, Toronto
Constabulary. Are you Daniel Nelson?

31:18.479 --> 31:20.196
William...

31:21.339 --> 31:23.507
You've come. I'm so glad.

31:24.196 --> 31:29.322
- You're... glad the police are here?
- Of course.

31:30.561 --> 31:33.154
The time has come for me to confess.

31:34.332 --> 31:36.883
I am a murderer.

31:41.627 --> 31:44.785
It was the summer of 1870.

31:45.795 --> 31:49.089
We thought it would be easy.

31:50.152 --> 31:52.944
I'd been working for a rich
family. I knew the house.

31:52.971 --> 31:54.558
We'd take the child; we'd get the money,

31:54.582 --> 31:56.417
and the child would be returned.

31:56.906 --> 31:58.388
But it wasn't.

31:58.879 --> 32:02.318
When we went to retrieve the money...

32:02.883 --> 32:04.568
we left the infant alone.

32:04.610 --> 32:08.250
One of us was supposed to
stay to look after him, but...

32:09.617 --> 32:11.705
we didn't trust one another.

32:11.785 --> 32:14.886
- What happened?
- We gave him pillows and a blanket.

32:15.356 --> 32:17.490
That's what you're
supposed to do, isn't it?

32:18.436 --> 32:20.189
But when we came back,

32:20.231 --> 32:22.967
the blanket was over
his face. He was dead.

32:23.194 --> 32:24.721
It was our fault.

32:24.911 --> 32:27.294
Our greed had made us killers.

32:28.398 --> 32:32.486
Never in my life did I
feel whole after that day.

32:33.416 --> 32:35.507
But you already had the money.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.698
I could never bring
myself to spend my share.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.167
It was tainted with blood.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.860
So I hid it away. I
thought maybe one day,

32:42.881 --> 32:45.284
my guilt would fade. But no.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.751
You did eventually go
back for it, though.

32:47.772 --> 32:50.049
To return it, along with my confession.

32:50.974 --> 32:53.932
Harry Murdoch spent his share.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.499
I imagine so, yes.

32:56.624 --> 32:58.665
He didn't carry the same guilt.

32:58.723 --> 33:00.592
Of course he did.

33:00.661 --> 33:02.250
He may have spent his money,

33:02.266 --> 33:04.897
but it tortured him nonetheless.

33:05.103 --> 33:07.236
I saw no evidence of that.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.875
He wore it on him every day.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.457
I don't believe he'd once been drunk

33:14.689 --> 33:16.553
before that day.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.538
At least his pain is gone now,

33:19.564 --> 33:21.582
even if his soul remains unclean.

33:22.713 --> 33:24.710
You urged him to confess.

33:24.768 --> 33:27.510
He wasn't ready. He was
open to the possibility.

33:27.557 --> 33:29.232
If he'd only had a little longer...

33:30.425 --> 33:34.263
his confession would have
meant even more than mine.

33:34.309 --> 33:37.376
He was the only one who knew
where the body was buried.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.738
Ahem. So, Harry Murdoch

33:42.764 --> 33:44.402
did not want to confess.

33:44.418 --> 33:46.641
And he wanted to stop
you from doing the same.

33:46.663 --> 33:48.543
No. No. No, Harry
didn't want to stop me.

33:48.668 --> 33:50.746
Then why did you kill him?

33:50.953 --> 33:53.113
Detective...

33:53.319 --> 33:56.060
I stand here before you

33:56.282 --> 33:58.231
and God himself

33:58.252 --> 34:01.140
ready to confess all of my sins.

34:02.255 --> 34:06.973
I am responsible for
only one death: the child.

34:07.232 --> 34:09.212
I did not kill your father.

34:12.295 --> 34:13.985
He shouldn't have done it.

34:14.049 --> 34:15.312
Who?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.092
Forbes.

34:17.525 --> 34:19.353
I told him!

34:20.695 --> 34:22.210
It wasn't his fault.

34:22.237 --> 34:25.158
I was there every step of
the way. He did all he could.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.992
He shouldn't have done it at all.

34:27.039 --> 34:28.460
It's his job.

34:28.585 --> 34:32.395
- It's our job.
- It's our job to help people,

34:32.411 --> 34:34.513
not to put them at risk.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.661
He kills this poor girl
and goes about his day?

34:37.858 --> 34:39.965
There should be consequences!

34:41.550 --> 34:44.301
People come here for all
sorts of reasons, Doctor.

34:44.576 --> 34:46.303
We can't control those reasons,

34:46.324 --> 34:48.431
we can't pick and choose.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.670
All we can do is good work

34:50.862 --> 34:52.795
inside these walls.

34:53.915 --> 34:56.534
You can blame Dr. Forbes if you like,

34:57.829 --> 34:59.731
but he did his best.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.177
So, do we have our killer?

35:15.434 --> 35:16.939
Yes, sir.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.389
I believe we do.

35:22.014 --> 35:23.710
Thank you for coming in.

35:24.053 --> 35:25.870
I thought you would both like to know

35:25.891 --> 35:28.247
that my father's killer has been caught.

35:28.686 --> 35:30.117
Oh, thank the Lord.

35:30.242 --> 35:33.339
At least Harry will be laid to
rest with some measure of peace.

35:33.386 --> 35:36.127
And I've decided to take
your advice, Miss Kelly.

35:36.252 --> 35:38.457
- Oh?
- I don't believe my father

35:38.483 --> 35:39.978
would have wanted a formal burial.

35:39.989 --> 35:42.862
He hadn't been a God-fearing
man in quite some time.

35:42.878 --> 35:45.054
He tried. On occasion.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.868
I believe he would have
preferred the words of his friends

35:48.942 --> 35:50.965
over that of a priest's.

35:51.779 --> 35:53.320
So, if you'll join me,

35:53.363 --> 35:55.497
I'd like to scatter his ashes.

35:56.442 --> 35:58.887
If you think that's what
he would have wanted.

36:00.578 --> 36:03.028
Where are we going, William?

36:03.493 --> 36:04.829
Here.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.469
My father often spoke of this place.

36:09.230 --> 36:11.015
He certainly did recently.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.955
Well... it's not much to
speak of if I'm honest.

36:15.014 --> 36:17.919
It's where he would have
wanted us to do this.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.319
There's only one thing
about my father's death

36:22.350 --> 36:24.156
that still doesn't add up.

36:24.669 --> 36:28.899
Mr. Nelson was going to return
his share of the ransom money.

36:29.406 --> 36:32.506
But it wasn't half. It was a quarter.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.735
So?

36:35.068 --> 36:37.149
What does that suggest to you?

36:38.432 --> 36:42.325
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- It suggests to me

36:42.658 --> 36:45.504
that four people were
involved in the kidnapping:

36:45.629 --> 36:48.911
Mr. Nelson, Harry
Murdoch, and two others.

36:49.613 --> 36:52.206
What of it? It could have been anyone.

36:52.692 --> 36:54.641
It happened 30 years ago.

36:54.678 --> 36:56.897
I think you're getting
ahead of yourself, William.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.464
Daniel Nelson couldn't be trusted.

36:59.589 --> 37:00.937
Oh?

37:01.402 --> 37:02.997
So you did know him?

37:03.525 --> 37:06.278
Only yesterday, you told me you didn't.

37:06.403 --> 37:09.883
- We don't know him.
- Then how do you know he can't be trusted?

37:10.008 --> 37:13.156
It's all right, Susan. We
can be honest with William.

37:13.388 --> 37:15.015
The truth is...

37:15.496 --> 37:18.918
we knew Nelson a little
bit, only through Harry.

37:18.966 --> 37:20.598
And that was years ago.

37:20.723 --> 37:23.456
The man was deranged,

37:23.651 --> 37:27.323
even back then. He hated us.

37:27.851 --> 37:30.693
We hid the fact because
we were concerned.

37:30.867 --> 37:33.303
If he said we have anything
to do with his crimes,

37:33.329 --> 37:35.278
it's all in his imagination.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.278
What is it you think he would have said?

37:38.785 --> 37:42.091
What does it matter? The
man was a lifelong criminal.

37:42.117 --> 37:43.760
All you have is his word.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.509
No, please,

37:45.577 --> 37:48.810
why don't you illuminate me
as to the truth, Mr. Vasser,

37:48.935 --> 37:51.282
you met with my father
the day that he died.

37:51.293 --> 37:53.854
- What did you discuss?
- Nothing.

37:54.256 --> 37:55.824
Old times.

37:55.877 --> 37:59.287
I believe he told you that
Mr. Nelson intended to confess.

37:59.915 --> 38:03.020
I assumed that Harry
Murdoch left that meeting

38:03.047 --> 38:04.932
to take care of business.

38:05.006 --> 38:07.050
But that's not what happened, is it?

38:07.499 --> 38:10.617
- How in the hell should I know?
- You know damn well!

38:11.330 --> 38:14.029
Harry went to see Nelson,
but not to kill him;

38:14.620 --> 38:18.286
to warn him that the two of you
intended to stop him from confessing.

38:18.316 --> 38:19.601
To stop both of them.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.733
- You can't prove a word of this.
- No.

38:23.536 --> 38:25.295
But I know it's true.

38:26.066 --> 38:28.205
You pretended to be his friend...

38:28.543 --> 38:31.231
let me believe the worst of my father.

38:31.290 --> 38:34.331
That his last days were
spent fixed on murder.

38:34.358 --> 38:37.467
You were going to let me
believe it the rest of my life!

38:37.505 --> 38:39.111
We did nothing.

38:39.403 --> 38:41.622
Don't you dare deny it.

38:42.264 --> 38:43.853
I know the truth.

38:44.352 --> 38:47.629
Now, you've done enough to
tarnish my father's memory.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.122
It's time he got the
justice he deserves.

38:50.148 --> 38:52.541
No... listen... don't...

38:52.562 --> 38:54.743
Why do you think I brought you out here,

38:54.754 --> 38:57.686
- to the middle of nowhere?
- Stop.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.346
It won't be the two of us
left out here to die, William.

39:04.373 --> 39:07.172
You'll die... just like your father.

39:07.198 --> 39:09.966
Trying to be a hero. Except this time,

39:10.008 --> 39:11.810
no one will find the body.

39:11.873 --> 39:14.853
Oi! Stop right there, the pair of you.

39:15.455 --> 39:17.494
You don't understand!

39:17.525 --> 39:20.430
He was trying to kill
us. He pulled his gun!

39:20.467 --> 39:23.024
Save your breath for
the courtroom, madam.

39:32.527 --> 39:34.006
Mr. Darling,

39:34.131 --> 39:36.457
please accept my condolences.

39:38.229 --> 39:39.567
Thank you.

39:39.858 --> 39:41.415
No one could have predicted...

39:41.428 --> 39:43.508
This doctor should never
have gone through with it.

39:44.158 --> 39:46.342
This is all his fault.

39:47.940 --> 39:50.801
If he knew that it was dangerous,

39:51.280 --> 39:54.328
he should never have
gone through with it!

39:55.352 --> 39:57.433
He should have said something.

39:57.558 --> 39:58.791
Like you did.

39:58.833 --> 40:02.615
Mr. Darling, Dr. Forbes is one of
the best surgeons in the country.

40:03.096 --> 40:06.643
If he loses his position
here, nothing will change.

40:07.099 --> 40:09.832
A lesser surgeon will take his place.

40:10.337 --> 40:12.228
More people will die.

40:13.908 --> 40:15.545
My daughter...

40:16.813 --> 40:19.670
I know and I'm so sorry.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.362
You still haven't got anything on us.

40:23.394 --> 40:26.262
Other than the fact you've
confessed to killing Harry Murdoch.

40:26.387 --> 40:28.142
You'll get a chance to question

40:28.158 --> 40:30.888
the integrity of Mr.
Nelson's testimony in court.

40:31.347 --> 40:33.297
But I suspect a jury will find him

40:33.323 --> 40:35.198
to be a very credible witness.

40:35.452 --> 40:38.426
Especially once his story is
corroborated by my father's.

40:38.452 --> 40:41.025
- Your father never said a thing.
- No.

40:41.389 --> 40:42.942
He didn't get the chance.

40:43.576 --> 40:45.466
But on the day he died,

40:45.519 --> 40:48.013
my father asked me to meet him here.

40:48.525 --> 40:50.665
He was going to tell me the story.

40:50.790 --> 40:52.714
Show me where the child is buried,

40:52.839 --> 40:55.334
which I suspect is very near to here.

40:56.306 --> 40:58.862
He was going to set things right.

40:59.776 --> 41:01.345
Now he has.

41:01.888 --> 41:03.335
Lads.

41:20.977 --> 41:23.665
Thank you. That was very nice.

41:24.093 --> 41:25.564
Father.

41:26.602 --> 41:27.939
Murdoch.

41:30.461 --> 41:32.583
Sir, I was out of line earlier.

41:32.708 --> 41:34.997
I was speaking of my own experience.

41:35.028 --> 41:37.152
I didn't intend to
suggest anything about you.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.884
I think you did.

41:40.906 --> 41:42.184
Maybe.

41:42.490 --> 41:45.479
- But I was wrong.
- Not completely.

41:49.329 --> 41:50.780
Sir.

41:50.881 --> 41:53.364
The constables found
the remains of the child.

41:53.401 --> 41:55.106
They were right next to the stone wall

41:55.119 --> 41:56.843
where your father wanted to meet you.

41:56.968 --> 41:58.030
Thank you.

41:58.317 --> 42:01.423
I suppose that will give the
family some measure of closure.

42:01.846 --> 42:05.019
Sir, I think that kind of
resolution is no small thing.

42:06.823 --> 42:08.919
I'm very sorry for your loss.

42:17.467 --> 42:19.668
It's a good thing you
did for him, William.

42:19.793 --> 42:21.143
What's that?

42:21.937 --> 42:24.295
He carried his guilt his whole life.

42:24.540 --> 42:26.243
That couldn't be undone.

42:26.632 --> 42:28.668
But you were able to bring it to light.

42:29.877 --> 42:31.990
Only after he'd died.

42:32.649 --> 42:35.890
But he wanted to confess before he died.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.841
That's why he wanted
to come and see you.

42:39.966 --> 42:42.231
He'd decided to do the right thing.

42:42.735 --> 42:45.054
And he did sacrifice himself for it.

42:45.573 --> 42:48.455
I suppose I should admire him for that.

42:49.208 --> 42:51.545
If only he'd done it sooner.

42:53.112 --> 42:56.860
Well, he could have walked into
any Station House to confess.

42:57.181 --> 42:59.260
He wanted to see you...

43:01.052 --> 43:03.667
... because you were both
seeking the same thing.

43:05.383 --> 43:08.760
Resolution... reconciliation.

43:08.861 --> 43:10.716
And now we'll never have it.

43:10.944 --> 43:12.114
No...

43:13.564 --> 43:16.314
But perhaps the fact
that you both wanted it

43:16.682 --> 43:18.169
is enough.
