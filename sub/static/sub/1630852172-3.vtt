-Two birds, one stone?
-We can't do that. Can we?

19:57.833 --> 19:59.125

19:59.208 --> 20:01.625

to the chair ourselves.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.083

-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.916
You, uh, rough night?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.750
-Um... One could say that.
-You okay?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.791
I'm actually glad
I ran into you.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.875
The craziest thing happened

20:17.958 --> 20:20.583
and I just need to talk about it
with someone I can trust.

20:20.666 --> 20:21.708
Last night...

20:25.416 --> 20:29.083
-You know what, forget it.
-No, um, it's, um--

20:29.166 --> 20:31.625
I'm sorry, all right? It's just,
I probably shouldn't--

20:31.708 --> 20:33.166
Yeah, of course. You shouldn't.
But you did anyway, so.

for our first real date!

21:00.125 --> 21:02.333
Yeah. And I got us tickets
to Jeremy O. Harris's new play.
Opening night.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.333
When I told him what it was,
he caved because he knows

21:04.416 --> 21:06.833
how important theater
is to you and everything.

21:06.916 --> 21:09.833
And you can tell me
what it all means afterwards.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.250
'Cause you know,
off-Broadway is like...

21:13.083 --> 21:14.208
all confusing and...

21:16.333 --> 21:18.416
-I thought you loved
the theater?
-No, I do. I do.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.250
And I couldn't be more excited.
Excuse me.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.375
-So you admit you did it?
-What, spill the bathwater?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.541
No, of course not.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.750
Do you know how many people
cheat in this school?

21:36.833 --> 21:38.458
This place has more
side pieces than Versailles.

21:38.541 --> 21:39.000
She could have meant any couple.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.875

21:40.958 --> 21:42.166

-What about me?

21:42.250 --> 21:45.166
Um... That, uh, you look
good enough to eat.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.583
Oh.

21:46.666 --> 21:48.458
Could you get me
a contraband straw?

21:48.541 --> 21:49.833
This paper ones always break.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.375
What the hell, Wolfe!
You told Gossip Girl about us?

21:55.458 --> 21:57.833
Oh, for fuck's sake,
not this again.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.208
-Again? What do you mean again?
-Why is everyone on my case?

22:00.291 --> 22:02.750
I have a lot of things
on my mind right now

22:02.833 --> 22:04.541
and your lesbian bed death
is certainly not one of them.

22:04.625 --> 22:08.125
You know what? If you're so
worried about it getting out,

22:08.208 --> 22:09.708
maybe you shouldn't have
done it in the first place!

22:13.625 --> 22:14.708

22:20.958 --> 22:23.000
Progress report on

22:23.083 --> 22:24.875
I searched the entire house
last night

22:24.958 --> 22:26.083
and couldn't find a thing.

22:26.166 --> 22:29.416
No hidden passages from the
service entrance to his room.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.083
No stray La Perlas
in the closet.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.375
No sign of a girlfriend at all.
So, he is hiding her.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.916
-But why?
-Hm.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.083
I Insta-stalked her.
Lola Morgan.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.916
-Singer-songwriter.
-Hm, that tracks.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I'm determined
to gain clarity on this.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.583
What about you?

22:47.666 --> 22:50.750
I gently prodded Dad and he said
they've never opened,

22:50.833 --> 22:52.416
so I don't know why Pops
is on there "newly single."

22:52.500 --> 22:55.416
So of course, I had
to take drastic measures.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.875
He probably has his reasons.
Maybe just leave it alone?

23:00.958 --> 23:04.041
Mm... Maybe Davis has his
and you should too?

23:25.750 --> 23:28.875
(SCOFFS) It's New York.
It's always garbage day.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.458
When are you going to get it?

23:30.541 --> 23:32.208
As far as the press
is concerned,

23:32.291 --> 23:33.208
he's R-Patz

23:33.291 --> 23:36.291

Otherwise, you'll end up being

Okay, I'm going to an opening
with Obie tonight,

23:48.041 --> 23:49.750
so I need your help now
more than ever.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.208
-Then let's get started.
-♪ ("STOP!" BY UPSAHL PLAYING) ♪

23:52.291 --> 23:54.708
First rule.
Never speak in public,

23:54.791 --> 23:55.666
which you've just learned.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.083
Second rule.
Never look directly at a camera.

23:58.166 --> 24:01.166
Never look directly anywhere.

24:01.250 --> 24:04.166
-These are contacts.
-I don't wear contacts.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.250
Exactly. They'll make
everything blurry.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.833
This way, you'll always
look like you're smizing.

24:08.916 --> 24:10.458
Because you literally
can't see anything.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.458
Third rule. Never sweat.

24:14.541 --> 24:17.000
-Relax, it's just Botox.
-I don't want Botox, I'm 14!

24:17.083 --> 24:19.000
It's preventative.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.791
And don't worry, it's not
for your face, anyway.

24:20.875 --> 24:21.875
Then what is it for?

24:22.791 --> 24:26.458
Fine, a pad will do. Lift.

24:26.541 --> 24:28.583
-That'll make me sweat more.
-And now no one will see it.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.208
-Fourth rule. Know your side.
-I have a side?

24:31.291 --> 24:31.875
You do and it's not
facing me right now.

24:31.958 --> 24:34.291

And finally, five tenets
to live and die by in public.

24:55.208 --> 24:57.708
Never eat, cry, PDA,
MTA or wear flats.

24:57.791 --> 24:58.666
-Where am I supposed to eat?
-In private,

24:58.750 --> 25:00.625
with the blinds drawn.
And whatever you do,

25:00.708 --> 25:03.125
never trust the doorman.
They sell tips to TMZ.

25:03.208 --> 25:04.750
No way! Jimmy's been
in the building

25:04.833 --> 25:07.458
-since the '70s when
my grandma first moved there.
-Ew. You live with your grandma?

25:07.541 --> 25:09.625
No. I mean, she's in a home,
but I stay in her apartment,

25:09.708 --> 25:11.416
which is probably something
I shouldn't have told you

25:11.500 --> 25:13.958
because it's rent-controlled
and the board doesn't know
that I'm there, but--

25:14.041 --> 25:16.166
Do I look like I want a story?
You're a client,
not a colleague.

25:16.250 --> 25:16.708
Now show me what's in your bag.

25:16.791 --> 25:19.000
Hey!

25:19.083 --> 25:20.958
I shouldn't be seen
with you right now.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.500
It's fine, Gossip Girl
knows nothing, okay?

25:24.583 --> 25:26.083
But she could find out.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.958
If you want to guarantee,
I'll never tell...

25:28.041 --> 25:29.958
-More steam-room shenanigans?
-(CHUCKLES)

25:30.041 --> 25:32.375
More of a catfishing expedition.

25:32.458 --> 25:35.750
I need you to create
a fake Scruff profile

25:35.833 --> 25:37.333
and use it on my dad.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.625
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

25:39.708 --> 25:42.250
Look, I need proof that he
is using the app
for more than perusal.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.166
-Why don't you just
do it yourself?
-You want me to sext my father?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.833
Is it any better you want me to?

25:46.916 --> 25:50.416
No, not as you. As Rafa. Okay?

25:50.500 --> 25:52.458
Clone his profile
and get chatty.

25:52.541 --> 25:53.916
No nudes, no private album,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.375
just the innocent intention
of meeting up on record.

25:56.458 --> 25:59.875
This is ridiculous,
even for you.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.958
Well, since the guy
won't fuck me,

26:02.041 --> 26:03.708
I might as well fuck with him.

I'll set it up myself.

Proximity plus the wine
