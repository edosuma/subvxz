WEBVTT

00:55.389 --> 00:59.058
We spoke of those times,
painful and lamented,

00:59.184 --> 01:03.354
when passion is the joy
and martyrdom of youth.

01:18.704 --> 01:22.248
An Eye for Beauty

02:08.587 --> 02:10.546
ln the centuries that follow,

02:11.173 --> 02:15.760
a civilization is always judged
by its architecture.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.806
Building is an activity of hope.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.683
The hope that what we create will be useful

02:22.810 --> 02:23.768
and beautiful.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.231
The hope of telling future generations
who we were.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.359
And the hope they will be moved,

02:31.485 --> 02:35.780
as we were by the architecture
of those who came before us.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.324
Thank you.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.583
We love your work.
- Bravo!

02:47.709 --> 02:49.252
Thank you so much.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.797
Canada is magnificent.
The prairies, mountains...

02:52.923 --> 02:53.965
The wild animals.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.050
Forgive me, l have to go.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.468
Again, bravo!
- Thank you.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.304
Where are we tomorrow?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.390
The Booksellers Award.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.270
Congratulations, Mr Sauvageau.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.730
Thanks.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.815
Thanks a lot.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.936
Here's our man!

05:13.355 --> 05:14.480
Hello, darling.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.272
You OK?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.024
Hey there!

05:18.610 --> 05:20.111
We started.
- Perfect.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.989
You made it!

05:23.865 --> 05:25.950
Things good?
- Fine, you?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.369
Hey bud.
- Dude.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.538
How was Toronto?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.622
Uneventful.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.083
Don't you avoid juries?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.543
On principle, yes.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.213
But they pay $1 500 per day plus expenses.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.800
These days l can't afford principles.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.302
Sure, and you drive a T-Bird.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.557
Bought at auction. Cheaper than a Toyota.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.892
But a way classier image.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.103
Aren't you building a house?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.897
One. For a lawyer.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.316
Hard to squeeze money from a lawyer.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.611
Who else was on the jury?

06:03.613 --> 06:05.656
Canada in all its splendor.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.242
A guy from the West Coast,

06:08.744 --> 06:10.536
who'd worked with Arthur Erickson.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.163
RlP.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.582
One from Saskatoon,

06:14.708 --> 06:15.666
half-Native,

06:15.792 --> 06:17.835
so politically desirable.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.129
A big designer from Toronto...

06:20.589 --> 06:21.589
lnevitably.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.799
And an engineer from Halifax.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.718
Semi-incompetent, but

06:25.844 --> 06:29.597
he lives a stone's throw from the Atlantic.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.639
From sea to sea.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.102
And the chairwoman. Faculty dean, decorated,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.771
and Jewish. lrreproachable.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.315
And the token French-Canadian.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.066
Yours truly!

07:57.060 --> 07:58.435
How's your plantation?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.147
Come see.
- Now?

08:01.273 --> 08:02.690
Sure.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.945
Not coming?

08:09.739 --> 08:10.656
For the walk.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.285
l did two hours of track today.
l'll stay put.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.248
Here.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.292
ls this it?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.507
Seeds from Humboldt County.
- California?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.346
Sinsemilla?

08:35.015 --> 08:35.931
Even better.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.141
A new hybrid.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.416
What's this?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.294
A steel angle. One on each side.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.628
lt's not strong enough.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.006
The joint's part of my bracing.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.674
lt can't budge.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.259
So what do you want?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.975
Bad back?
- lt's been a month.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.477
Walking hurts like hell.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.646
Go see lsabelle.
- No time!

10:48.648 --> 10:51.817
l need something like this.

10:51.943 --> 10:52.651
ln steel.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.198
How will you hide it?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.241
Furring.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.993
No, not furring.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.661
lt'll be hideous.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.289
You're the architect. Find a solution.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.708
l'll find something.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.901
When the Montreal symphony hall opened

11:34.027 --> 11:37.112
the architect was barely mentioned.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.408
The politicians crowed
while critics blasted the acoustician.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.452
Palais Montcalm, same thing.

11:43.578 --> 11:46.914
When our firm designed the Laval hospital,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.792
we weren't invited to the inauguration!

11:49.918 --> 11:52.211
The mayor, ministers, execs...

11:52.337 --> 11:54.588
even the Mafia was invited.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.215
But not the architects!

11:56.341 --> 11:57.299
An oversight.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.511
They warned us in first year:

12:00.637 --> 12:03.430
An architect's only as good as his client.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.642
At least you can teach. You love it.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.018
l just can't.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.145
That's life.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.355
She's an MD, l'm an RN.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.440
She earns 3 times my salary.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.110
l work as hard, even harder.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.490
l have to go back to Toronto.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.367
Already?

14:29.494 --> 14:30.327
You just got back.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.374
There's a jury for student projects.

14:36.125 --> 14:36.875
They insisted.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.503
We can use the money.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.673
No, Steph. Wait!

14:42.799 --> 14:44.091
Not the yellow ones.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.260
The color doesn't work.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.181
Which ones, then?

14:52.767 --> 14:53.475
White.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.561
Yes, white, please.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.180
Playing in the tournament?

15:32.307 --> 15:33.515
Are you crazy?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.142
Why?
- No way.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.561
Why not? You used to compete.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.855
You reached the finals 3 years ago.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.231
You were great.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.233
lt made me ill even then.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.445
You never noticed.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.655
l couldn't step back on court.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.075
The idea of competing makes me sick.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.329
Your opponent's out to kill you.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.082
l can't face that again.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.167
lt's over.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.422
You hit as well as ever, luv.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.549
You too, babe.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.242
Hello, madame.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.038
What brings you?

30:33.040 --> 30:35.374
l was driving by. l wanted to see you.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.335
Good trip?

30:37.461 --> 30:38.169
Excellent.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.382
You OK?

30:43.509 --> 30:44.217
Fine.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.551
Nothing special?

30:46.053 --> 30:46.969
Nope.

30:47.471 --> 30:48.346
You?

30:48.972 --> 30:50.515
Me? Not really.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.227
lsabelle called.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.437
About playing golf.

30:57.064 --> 30:57.813
You want to?

30:57.940 --> 30:58.773
Sure.

30:59.650 --> 31:00.483
lf you do.

31:02.819 --> 31:03.736
ln a minute?

31:03.862 --> 31:04.695
ln a minute.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.140
We lost our spouses.

32:14.683 --> 32:15.933
They can't be far.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.104
Did you order?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.439
l was waiting.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.162
Where were you?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.414
There. We looked for you.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.753
Right there.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.881
This is awkward, but...

33:31.301 --> 33:32.718
ln Toronto,

33:33.512 --> 33:34.845
l slept with a girl.

33:35.931 --> 33:36.847
A prostitute?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.016
No, not a prostitute.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.644
A really nice girl.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.315
l'm scared l may have an infection.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.983
You feel a burning?

33:49.069 --> 33:50.236
A little, maybe.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.571
Like razor blades?

33:53.615 --> 33:55.366
No, it's more...

33:56.201 --> 33:57.201
uncomfortable.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.704
ls there any discharge?

34:03.709 --> 34:04.709
Let's take a look.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.258
Can l just get antibiotics?

34:15.303 --> 34:16.929
l'm the only doctor now.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.306
l see a dozen penises daily.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.184
And l'm not of your persuasion.

34:22.644 --> 34:23.519
Drop your pants.

34:48.837 --> 34:49.920
You're making me hard.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.756
Oh, come on!

34:53.592 --> 34:54.550
Hey, lsa...

34:55.552 --> 34:57.011
Goodness, sorry.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.648
Pee in this, give it to Melissa.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.442
She'll take some blood.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.986
We'll get the results

35:14.404 --> 35:15.154
in 2 days.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.490
Did you make love to Steph?

35:19.576 --> 35:23.788
Don't, for now.
l'm 98%  sure you're fine there.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.915
But up here...

35:27.042 --> 35:27.833
What?

35:29.586 --> 35:33.339
You may not be cut out to be a Don Juan.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.820
Dear friends,

35:57.030 --> 35:59.323
Luc Sauvageau has talent.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.452
Luc,

36:04.371 --> 36:09.750
Gigi and l will live in the most
beautiful house on the North Shore.

36:09.876 --> 36:10.501
Thank you.

36:10.919 --> 36:11.961
Thank you so much!

36:12.712 --> 36:13.879
Very kind. Look...

36:14.422 --> 36:15.548
May l?

36:17.425 --> 36:20.761
l designed it, but Roger built it.

36:21.638 --> 36:22.346
Cheers.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.689
My back's feeling its age.
Thanks, Luc.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.440
My pleasure, Roger.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.076
Come see me tomorrow, Mr Bouchard.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.662
l'm building a house. No time.

36:47.122 --> 36:50.040
l start at 7:30. You'll be first in line.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.208
l'll bring him.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.002
That's all l need.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.004
7:30.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.505
l'll expect you.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.846
l just love architecture.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.223
l'm crazy about beauty.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.809
At college l was quite the artist.

37:08.935 --> 37:09.727
Wonderful.

37:10.186 --> 37:13.647
l'm on 2 Ministry of Culture committees.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.899
Really? Fantastic.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.569
You must know Pascal Montambault,
the director of the Museum of Civilization.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.143
Work the ball!

37:51.895 --> 37:52.645
That's it! 1 ,

37:53.313 --> 37:54.229
2,

37:54.940 --> 37:57.608
3, 4... and switch!

37:58.610 --> 38:01.362
Go on! 1 , 2...

38:02.656 --> 38:05.366
Look at each other, girls!

38:06.952 --> 38:07.910
Two touches!

38:09.245 --> 38:10.955
Keep possession.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.414
Possession!

38:12.540 --> 38:13.457
Yes!

38:23.176 --> 38:23.884
Well?

38:24.386 --> 38:27.930
You're fine, but l have bad news.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.224
Mr Bouchard's not good.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.518
lt looks serious.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.397
l'm sending him to Quebec City for tests.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.941
Better go see them.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.485
Their kids are far away.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.281
Thanks.

39:01.214 --> 39:02.715
Did lsabelle

39:04.050 --> 39:05.175
say anything?

39:09.848 --> 39:11.598
She said it's serious.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.101
That's probably all she knows.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.858
We won't worry yet.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.069
Let's wait for the tests.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.337
l slept with a girl in Toronto.

40:23.463 --> 40:24.379
An escort?

40:24.506 --> 40:26.048
No, a girl.

40:26.508 --> 40:27.674
Well, it happens.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.178
Your wife seems depressed.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.181
l know. l'm getting worried.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.323
Going hunting?

40:53.660 --> 40:55.577
Goose hunting, next week.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.455
With your pal?

40:58.957 --> 40:59.706
Yeah.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.548
Jean's going moose hunting.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.758
His mom told me.

41:30.864 --> 41:32.030
l better go.

41:33.908 --> 41:34.908
l'll be back.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.703
What's wrong?

43:01.829 --> 43:02.454
Nothing.

43:02.789 --> 43:04.206
l saw you pull in.

43:05.959 --> 43:07.542
What did you do today?

43:09.087 --> 43:09.836
Nothing.

43:10.213 --> 43:10.963
Nothing?

43:11.339 --> 43:12.798
l didn't do any work.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.218
l went to see Roger.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.429
How is he?

43:20.682 --> 43:21.473
Bad shape.

43:27.063 --> 43:29.106
The girls were real pains.

43:29.983 --> 43:32.109
They must feel the storm coming.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.779
lt's going to snow.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.282
Oh yeah?

43:38.408 --> 43:39.574
The radio said.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.334
That girl in Toronto...

44:31.461 --> 44:32.878
l think about her.

44:33.004 --> 44:33.754
Only normal.

44:35.298 --> 44:36.715
Don't do what Hugo did.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.633
The doctor?

44:39.761 --> 44:43.013
When lsabelle arrived here,
he didn't know she's lesbian.

44:43.389 --> 44:46.058
He found her brilliant, beautiful...

44:46.476 --> 44:47.851
He fell hard.

44:48.478 --> 44:49.853
Head over heels.

44:51.147 --> 44:54.149
He's the strictly honest kind.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.985
So he told his wife.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.071
She went ballistic,

44:59.197 --> 45:01.490
left in the middle of the night.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.993
Next day he declared
his love to lsabelle.

45:05.578 --> 45:09.039
She said she liked him,
but was living with Melissa,

45:09.165 --> 45:11.500
and he could go stuff his fantasies.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.211
He moved up north.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.129
Never found anyone else.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.547
He ruined his life.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.842
Trying to be loyal and sincere.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.423
ls it dry enough?

46:00.216 --> 46:02.008
Probably. We'll see.

46:20.361 --> 46:21.945
lt's really smooth.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.581
You're right.

46:33.040 --> 46:33.999
Very mellow.

46:48.639 --> 46:49.514
You OK?

46:50.057 --> 46:51.183
lt's strong.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.642
You could've warned me!

47:25.426 --> 47:26.551
You OK, my love?

47:28.513 --> 47:29.846
l don't feel well.

47:32.475 --> 47:33.892
Want to lie down?

47:36.270 --> 47:37.354
Let me.

47:41.359 --> 47:42.234
l'll take you.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.612
l'll help you up.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.447
Come on.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.752
Are you OK?

48:04.090 --> 48:05.840
l'm fine. lt's over.

48:49.635 --> 48:50.927
There's none left.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.517
She's sick.

48:57.977 --> 48:59.519
Really sick?

49:25.212 --> 49:26.046
So?

49:26.172 --> 49:27.130
Good.

49:27.256 --> 49:27.964
What's my time?

49:32.345 --> 49:33.511
l forgot to click.

49:33.638 --> 49:34.804
Steph, jeez!

49:34.930 --> 49:36.890
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.

49:37.475 --> 49:38.558
Yeah, but...!

49:38.684 --> 49:39.392
Sorry.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.564
l want to go home.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.024
Get me out of here.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.234
You need treatment.

49:49.028 --> 49:50.987
My brother went through this.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.572
l know what to expect.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.407
Take me home.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.164
l know, l spoke to the nurse.

50:01.290 --> 50:03.041
So, do l bring him home?

50:03.167 --> 50:05.669
We're not equipped here.

50:05.795 --> 50:09.130
He's parked in the fucking hall,
he's miserable.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.465
That's how it is.

50:12.093 --> 50:14.344
Can you control his pain?

50:14.762 --> 50:15.679
l'll try.

50:16.806 --> 50:18.223
What can l say?

50:18.349 --> 50:20.558
l'm so tired of cases like this.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.143
l understand.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.413
You OK?

51:42.933 --> 51:45.727
We built some beautiful houses.

51:47.438 --> 51:48.938
We tried, anyway.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.399
Not try, dammit!

51:53.235 --> 51:54.402
We succeeded.

51:56.322 --> 51:57.447
lf you say so.

52:01.035 --> 52:02.577
My nephew Jean...

52:03.829 --> 52:05.622
You should hire him.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.541
He's almost as good as me.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.712
We're not there yet.

52:13.839 --> 52:15.465
You thought about it.

52:15.841 --> 52:16.591
Come on!

52:18.260 --> 52:19.969
Don't lie to me.

52:20.346 --> 52:22.263
l know you inside out.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.681
As ambitious as hell.

52:25.392 --> 52:26.851
You thought about it.

52:29.647 --> 52:30.563
OK, then.

52:32.566 --> 52:33.858
l thought about it.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.198
Glad to hear it.

53:03.681 --> 53:07.016
l've been loved to perfection for 34 years.

53:07.977 --> 53:09.727
Few women can say that.

56:12.745 --> 56:13.995
Are we real?

56:16.707 --> 56:17.665
Yeah.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.168
Of course.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.109
And them?

56:45.861 --> 56:46.652
Who, them?

56:48.405 --> 56:49.447
On TV.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.452
lt's a documentary.

56:57.039 --> 56:59.373
But reality can't be everywhere.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.375
You know?

57:03.670 --> 57:04.754
Not exactly.

57:09.510 --> 57:11.969
Re... reality can't be everywhere.

57:14.098 --> 57:15.348
There's us and...

57:19.228 --> 57:20.186
Or else...

57:21.105 --> 57:22.271
There's nothing.

57:26.819 --> 57:30.738
l feel panic.

57:32.199 --> 57:32.907
Stop.

58:05.399 --> 58:06.440
Try to sleep.

58:13.532 --> 58:14.657
Come back.

58:15.284 --> 58:16.117
Don't go.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.244
l'll be outside.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.079
No, stay here.

58:22.124 --> 58:23.040
Don't move.

58:27.254 --> 58:28.588
Don't leave me alone.

58:33.302 --> 58:34.594
Never abandon me.

58:37.306 --> 58:38.806
l'm not abandoning you.

58:39.725 --> 58:40.683
l'm here.

58:42.186 --> 58:43.561
l won't move, my love.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.817
lf you did, l'd kill myself.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.365
l'll always be here.

59:51.713 --> 59:52.505
We're here!

59:54.383 --> 59:57.468
My first contract was an Econoprix drugstore.

59:58.178 --> 59:58.844
The horror!

59:59.429 --> 1:00:02.515
l met the CEO in his 40th-floor office.

1:00:02.641 --> 1:00:05.768
He said, "Our customer lives in an ugly house

1:00:05.894 --> 1:00:07.979
with ugly furniture, ugly curtains,

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:09.272
on an ugly street.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:12.191
l want him to feel right at home.

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:14.110
l want ugly drugstores.

1:00:14.236 --> 1:00:15.653
lt's made me billions."

1:00:15.988 --> 1:00:18.698
l went to my boss and quit.

1:00:19.283 --> 1:00:20.992
We took over.

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:23.661
Designed monstrosities that earn millions.

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:28.124
You're not forced to read a bad book,
or listen to bad music.

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:30.209
ln elevators.
- Shops.

1:00:30.335 --> 1:00:31.877
Restaurants.

1:00:32.004 --> 1:00:33.170
A building's worse!

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:38.551
An ugly building that you have to look at
every day poisons your life.

1:00:38.677 --> 1:00:40.344
Most people don't realize.

1:00:40.470 --> 1:00:42.638
Ugliness is a crime against humanity.

1:00:44.099 --> 1:00:44.890
Thanks.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.561
Your crêpes are exquisite!

1:00:48.687 --> 1:00:49.603
l had help.

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:26.724
You're too fast for me.

1:01:31.271 --> 1:01:33.147
Your mouth's a popsicle.

1:01:33.732 --> 1:01:34.482
Don't like it?

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:35.524
On the contrary.

1:01:39.154 --> 1:01:39.904
Let's go.

1:01:47.079 --> 1:01:47.828
Stop!

1:01:49.331 --> 1:01:50.039
What?

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:52.166
Stop.

1:01:57.005 --> 1:01:57.797
Wait.

1:01:59.758 --> 1:02:00.508
l can't...

1:02:01.134 --> 1:02:02.176
l can't go back up.

1:02:02.302 --> 1:02:03.386
Why not?

1:02:03.512 --> 1:02:04.303
The lift.

1:02:06.014 --> 1:02:07.056
Get the car.

1:02:08.141 --> 1:02:09.100
l'll wait here.

1:02:10.936 --> 1:02:12.561
We've skied here for years.

1:02:13.355 --> 1:02:15.231
You've always taken this lift.

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:17.024
l can't do it.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:18.359
l swear.

1:02:18.485 --> 1:02:19.819
lt's silly. Come on.

1:02:20.695 --> 1:02:21.404
Come with me.

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:23.739
l'll hold you tight.

1:02:26.284 --> 1:02:27.034
Okay?

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:11.120
l'm scared.

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:13.247
We'll fall.

1:03:13.373 --> 1:03:14.206
No, we won't.

1:03:14.666 --> 1:03:15.458
Don't worry.

1:03:15.917 --> 1:03:16.709
We'll be fine.

1:03:18.587 --> 1:03:19.336
Nearly there.

1:03:23.175 --> 1:03:24.300
l can't!

1:03:24.676 --> 1:03:25.801
We're there.

1:03:29.598 --> 1:03:30.431
Let me go!

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:32.641
Stop!
- Calm down.

1:04:16.102 --> 1:04:17.186
We're going home.

1:04:17.312 --> 1:04:18.646
No need.

1:04:19.022 --> 1:04:21.565
You've only skied one run.

1:04:22.108 --> 1:04:23.484
l'll have a coffee.

1:04:24.152 --> 1:04:24.944
l'll wait.

1:04:26.571 --> 1:04:27.613
You go ski.

1:04:27.739 --> 1:04:29.532
l can't leave you alone.

1:04:29.658 --> 1:04:30.950
lt's OK, don't worry.

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:33.494
l'll be safe in the restaurant.

1:04:33.954 --> 1:04:34.995
Go have fun.

1:04:35.121 --> 1:04:36.413
No, look at me.

1:04:37.332 --> 1:04:38.165
Are you sure?

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.210
l'm fine.

1:05:16.955 --> 1:05:18.747
What do you want us to do?

1:05:20.709 --> 1:05:22.126
Some sprints?

1:05:24.087 --> 1:05:26.880
Practise passing, maybe?

1:07:55.238 --> 1:07:56.530
lt's funny.

1:07:56.656 --> 1:08:00.242
Have you ever gone on MatchCom

1:08:00.869 --> 1:08:01.702
or eHarmony?

1:08:01.828 --> 1:08:03.078
You visit those sites?

1:08:03.204 --> 1:08:04.663
A girl can dream.

1:08:05.165 --> 1:08:06.874
lt's fascinating.

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.252
People are more and more demanding.

1:08:10.712 --> 1:08:11.670
Thanks.

1:08:11.796 --> 1:08:14.673
The other day a woman was seeking...

1:08:15.008 --> 1:08:17.134
a mycologist, avid cyclist,

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.094
between 35 and 39,

1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:23.015
no beard or moustache, but not bald.

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:24.600
l mean, really!

1:08:24.726 --> 1:08:25.768
Maybe he exists.

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:28.353
But that's just the question:

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:30.647
Today, with the lnternet,

1:08:30.774 --> 1:08:34.109
will everyone find their soulmate?

1:08:34.486 --> 1:08:36.069
With us, it was luck.

1:08:36.863 --> 1:08:39.323
Nicolas and l were neighbors as teens.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:40.532
Alas.

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:42.618
Luck.

1:08:43.077 --> 1:08:45.370
We worked in the same hospital.

1:08:45.497 --> 1:08:46.413
Enfant-Jésus.

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:47.456
Luck.

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:49.374
How'd you two meet?

1:08:51.169 --> 1:08:53.962
We were on the varsity tennis team.

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:55.380
Luck.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:59.885
He was a country boy with long legs.

1:09:00.011 --> 1:09:01.345
He'd grown too fast.

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:04.139
He was timid,

1:09:04.265 --> 1:09:05.390
always blushing.

1:09:06.726 --> 1:09:07.768
So endearing.

1:09:31.376 --> 1:09:32.125
Hi.

1:09:33.837 --> 1:09:34.586
You good?

1:09:40.718 --> 1:09:41.468
Your wife...

1:09:46.266 --> 1:09:47.808
She won't make it alone.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:49.852
She won't?

1:09:52.647 --> 1:09:53.981
She needs help.

1:09:55.984 --> 1:09:57.359
l dragged her here.

1:09:59.487 --> 1:10:01.363
Shall l ask around?

1:10:07.328 --> 1:10:08.620
You home tomorrow night?

1:10:09.998 --> 1:10:13.458
No. l have a regional committee meeting.

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:15.961
ls Melissa going?

1:10:16.671 --> 1:10:19.631
Yeah, she's seeing friends. Why?

1:10:19.757 --> 1:10:21.425
l hoped Steph could visit.

1:10:23.344 --> 1:10:24.553
l'll be in Quebec.

1:10:25.388 --> 1:10:26.221
Sorry.

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:30.809
l feel guilty.

1:10:33.605 --> 1:10:35.230
l'll see what l can do.

1:10:35.356 --> 1:10:36.690
l'll let you know.

1:10:38.359 --> 1:10:39.109
Thanks.

1:10:39.485 --> 1:10:40.319
Welcome.

1:11:03.968 --> 1:11:05.302
Sure you'll be OK?

You've left your rustic retreat,

1:12:32.807 --> 1:12:34.850

1:25:42.763 --> 1:25:44.138
You haven't moved?

1:25:47.976 --> 1:25:49.393

1:27:27.868 --> 1:27:29.118
The Cistercians.

1:27:30.996 --> 1:27:32.705
To build an abbey.

1:27:35.709 --> 1:27:36.542
Just imagine.

1:27:38.629 --> 1:27:39.754

1:27:45.844 --> 1:27:47.178

1:28:42.359 --> 1:28:44.485
Even love's not enough.

1:28:46.989 --> 1:28:47.989
lt is for me.

1:30:08.487 --> 1:30:10.321
Even to imagine.

1:30:11.448 --> 1:30:12.865
lt's so painful.

1:30:15.077 --> 1:30:17.036

1:30:23.168 --> 1:30:25.503
to kill myself, just to stop it.

1:30:25.629 --> 1:30:27.254

1:30:55.367 --> 1:30:56.450

1:30:57.369 --> 1:30:59.078
You could've slapped me.

1:30:59.538 --> 1:31:01.163
Or called me a slut.

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:04.333

1:31:04.668 --> 1:31:05.459
Alas.

She even came to Quebec City.

1:31:31.027 --> 1:31:32.444
