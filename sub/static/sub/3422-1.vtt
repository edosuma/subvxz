00:41.639 --> 00:42.945
Yeah, we'll see about that.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.901
I wanna be traded.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.060
Here's Tommy. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.340
Happy Halloween!

01:04.440 --> 01:06.429
I thought we were all
dressing as babies.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.591
Sorry. Sorry.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.860
Hey, baby, you're behind me.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.505
I just wanna tell you I love you!

01:14.600 --> 01:16.700
- No biking in the video.
- Here.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.902
- Doesn't make sense.
- Oh, gosh. All right.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.782
- Enough.
- Dan, why are you so flexible?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.270
Let's get out of this...

01:30.720 --> 01:32.231
Did you see that?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.025
There it is!

01:48.600 --> 01:49.980
It's really cold!

01:50.080 --> 01:51.511
No, you don't.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.980
- I think I'm filming.
- Are you filming? Thanks.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.068
So, Jack, anything you wanna say to Dan?
'Cause this is it, buddy.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.391
Tommy?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.982
Don't you think if you're shooting the
wedding you should wear some pants?

02:24.800 --> 02:26.743
Hi, how are you?

02:30.080 --> 02:34.788
Dan, today is your day, my friend,
and we are happy to be here.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.862
Tommy even wore his lucky boxers.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.421
We're here for you, brother,
and we love you.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.790
Lauren is late.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.500
She's gotta be freaking
out that I'm late.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.146
Any pre-wedding advice for Dan and Skylar?

02:50.560 --> 02:53.020
Put the other person's needs first.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.500
Maybe that's why I'm still single.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.862
Quit chasing after
the wrong girls, buddy.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.460
How you feeling, buddy?

02:59.560 --> 03:02.740
Do not film me while I'm peeing.
That's not gonna make the video.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.220
Oh, it is, it is.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.500
I left my car running
outside if you wanna bolt.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.940
Your car wouldn't make it
out of the parking lot.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.380
- It's a piece.
- What? Just put some new tires on it.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.980
Could always hijack the limo.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.751
You need to find yourself
a girl like Skylar.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.109
Groom wisdom. Nice.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.140
I'm serious. There's nothing better than
being in an honest, committed relationship.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.340
Coming from the guy who
just joined the church

03:25.440 --> 03:27.860
because his fiancÃ©e wouldn't
have married him otherwise.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.222
Hey, the girl gets what she wants, bro.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.465
Gentlemen.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.580
- Mr. Chapman.
- Mr. Chapman.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.145
Congrats. Hey, nice wedding.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.700
Okay, if this is as compelling content
as you're getting, we're gonna be in trouble.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.220
- I got great stuff with Dan. Wait till you see it.
- I'm sure.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.467
Get out of the way.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.425
Just trying to capture the good,
the bad and the ugly.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.981
Did you just use the word "ugly"
at Skylar's wedding?

03:57.640 --> 03:58.946
I did.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.671
- You know, you could help.
- I am. I got you in focus.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.031
You gonna catch the bouquet?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.265
Yeah, she is.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.904
All right, let's do this.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.749
Do you, Dan, take Skylar to
be your lawfully wedded wife,

04:53.600 --> 04:57.300
and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.700
so long as you both shall live?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.140
I do.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.501
And do you, Skylar, take Dan to
be your lawfully wedded husband?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.342
- I do.
- The rings?

05:17.320 --> 05:21.106
I give you this ring as a
sign of my promise to you.

05:21.920 --> 05:27.026
With all that I have and
all that I am, I honor you.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.708
I give you this ring as a
sign of my promise to you.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.630
And with all that I have and
all that I am, I will honor you.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.028
And now, by the power vested in me,

05:45.720 --> 05:48.790
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.030
You may kiss your bride.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.584
Dan! Come here!

06:17.400 --> 06:19.104
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.180
Are you the videographer or something?

06:21.280 --> 06:24.224
Documentaries.
I'm doing it as a favor for Dan.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.620
I was his wingman throughout LSU.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.829
Sorry, my name... I'm Tommy.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.100
Ashton. Nice to meet you.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.940
Nice meeting you. I'll facebook you.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.630
She's taken, Tommy.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.264
Story of my life.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.980
Father, we come here today
to thank you for Skylar and Dan

06:44.080 --> 06:46.626
and the gift they are to all of us here.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.585
We ask that you keep them close

06:49.640 --> 06:52.107
and keep them in your
heart and bless them.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.510
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.781
What?

07:22.440 --> 07:23.826
It's on me.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.429
I will never forget when
Dan called me and said,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.189
"I'm gonna ask Skylar to marry me."

07:34.920 --> 07:37.990
Dan said to me, "When you find the one,

07:38.200 --> 07:43.147
"whether you believe in God,
whether you believe in fate or whatever,

07:44.280 --> 07:45.870
"you act on it."

07:46.720 --> 07:51.542
And you did, and I tip my hat
to you for doing just that.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.582
So let's give a warm round of
applause for the bride and the groom.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.260
Cake for the girl at table one.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.700
Is it diet?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.940
Come on, you gotta be done
starving yourself. The wedding's over.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.665
Good point.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.865
Look at that.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.350
So cute.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.940
I've seen you in action at
weddings before, all right,

08:31.040 --> 08:33.871
and currently you're not dancing
on a table or breaking glasses.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.830
Come on. It's me.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.220
I'm at my best friend's wedding and
I'm upset because my boyfriend

08:40.320 --> 08:42.260
just gave a speech on
how important it is

08:42.360 --> 08:45.304
to act on it when you cross
paths with the right person.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.906
It was a pretty good speech.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.820
I crossed paths with
Jack seven years ago.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.943
No, no, I get it. I get it. I get it.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.824
I'm so lame. I'm sorry.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.064
No, you're not lame. Okay?
You are a catch.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.911
Yeah. Most amazing girl I've ever met.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.386
What?

09:08.040 --> 09:11.269
- Top 100 for sure.
- Good. Funny.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.469
But probably number one.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.104
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.463
It's time for the bouquet toss.
Come on, ladies.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.261
One!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.420
- Two!
- Throw it over here, Skylar.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.701
Three!

09:37.080 --> 09:38.220
Let's get Jack here!

09:38.320 --> 09:39.910
Jack, get up here!

09:51.280 --> 09:52.740
Hey, baby. You okay?

09:52.840 --> 09:54.980
- I gotta go.
- Why?

09:55.080 --> 09:56.670
- What happened?
- Don't worry about it.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.861
Is everything okay?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.540
I love you, and I show it.
So I don't get it.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.301
Either you don't love me, or you have a
really crappy way of letting me know it.

10:08.440 --> 10:12.101
Am I missing something?
Seriously, I don't know what...

10:12.520 --> 10:14.580
You rolled your eyes. It was a joke.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.540
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.981
Wait. Hold on.
Please don't leave. Please.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.140
I love you. I'm sorry. We...

10:22.240 --> 10:24.380
Tommy. Really? Come on, man.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.660
- Tommy, please?
- What's going on?

10:25.760 --> 10:28.591
Come on, man. I know you got
a camera, but... Ally! Ally!

10:31.120 --> 10:32.460
What's going on?

10:33.520 --> 10:34.740
We'll just talk after.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.980
We'll give her some time to cool down.
Let's go back and party. Come on.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.989
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.300
Thanks for heading up to our room
to get the presents, Tommy.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.990
Yeah, no problem.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.700
Now that I have you guys trapped,
let me ask you this.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.660
What is the secret to staying
married so many years?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.385
I'm always right.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.550
That's actually correct.

10:55.400 --> 11:00.347
Skylar, if you're watching this now,
your wedding was absolutely perfect.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.140
Would she have it any other way?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.980
It should have been at the church.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.980
It was her choice,
even if it's not what we wanted.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.540
And Skylar always gets what she wants?

11:10.640 --> 11:12.310
Like mother, like...

11:13.680 --> 11:16.101
- Did you feel that?
- It just got so cold.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.826
Mr. Chapman... Mrs. Chapman,
what's wrong? You okay?

11:24.520 --> 11:27.021
You okay, Mr. Chapman?
Somebody help me! Help me!

11:29.440 --> 11:31.065
Somebody help me!

11:56.120 --> 11:57.860
What's happening?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.550
She's not breathing.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.820
Does anyone know CPR?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.545
Tommy! Tommy!

12:04.320 --> 12:06.900
Jack, I'm coming.
Stay there. I'm coming.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.740
Sky!

12:09.840 --> 12:11.220
I can't find her!

12:11.320 --> 12:14.788
She's dead. She's not waking up.
Have you seen my parents?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.302
- My mom? Please?
- Hey, Jack.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.271
Jack. Jack.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.421
Jack.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.820
I was with Skylar's parents in the
elevator, and they just fell dead.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.420
- What?
- They fell over. They just fell dead.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.110
What?

12:33.320 --> 12:36.549
Skylar, your parents were in
the elevator, and they just...

12:36.880 --> 12:39.904
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.904
- I'm so sorry.
- Allison. Allison.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.582
Sounded like a missile.
Come outside. Come on.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.030
So close!

13:14.480 --> 13:16.025
Look out! Get back!

13:19.040 --> 13:20.824
Did you see that? Jack, Jack, come on!

13:24.400 --> 13:26.580
Earthquake! Watch out! Watch out!

13:26.680 --> 13:27.827
Run!

13:29.400 --> 13:30.831
Tommy, look out!

13:37.120 --> 13:39.666
Run! Come on, Sky!

13:47.200 --> 13:48.870
Stay with me, Sky!

14:00.920 --> 14:02.704
Get away from the window!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.386
What is that?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.506
Okay?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.228
- I need to find Ally.
- We don't know where she is.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.340
My phone doesn't have any service.
Does yours?

14:18.440 --> 14:21.380
- Check my phone.
- It says she's at 45 North.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.187
- When did she text you that?
- About a half hour ago. We gotta go.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.341
Tommy!

14:50.600 --> 14:51.860
So what do you think
killed all those people?

14:51.960 --> 14:53.460
Why are we still alive?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.620
The fact that there was an earthquake
and the lightning like that.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.660
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Did you see their eyes?

14:57.760 --> 15:00.431
- Maybe it's aliens!
- Yeah, Dan, it's aliens!

15:08.480 --> 15:11.026
Look, guys, over here.
Over here, over here!

15:16.120 --> 15:18.220
I'll stay right here with you, ma'am.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.700
- Keep your head up.
- You okay, Sky?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.390
Does that hurt you?

15:23.640 --> 15:25.660
I heard my parents talk
about this for years.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.100
What?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.380
- It's the biblical end of the world.
- Don't be ridiculous.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.500
It's not ridiculous.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.180
All the good people are gone and
all the bad people are left here.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.580
Whatever's happening is rooted
with science, all right, not fantasy.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.148
- No. You're wrong.
- Am I? You go to church, right?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.740
You're a good person,
you're still alive,

15:41.840 --> 15:43.540
so it's obviously not the
biblical end of the world.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.140
Guys, enough with the religious BS, okay?
It's happened, it's done,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.627
and we all survived.
It's not the end of the world.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.860
We have to get to safety,
'cause things are gonna get really bad.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.107
What do you call this?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.266
It's hail.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.101
Go, go, go!

16:11.040 --> 16:12.141
Don't let go of my hand!

16:13.960 --> 16:16.904
Here! Come on! Get in the library!

16:18.240 --> 16:19.705
Keep going!

16:23.400 --> 16:24.831
Skylar! No!

16:35.560 --> 16:37.100
- Where's Skylar?
- What?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.380
- Where's Skylar?
- What do you mean?

16:39.480 --> 16:40.786
Sky!

16:41.440 --> 16:42.746
Get back. Skylar?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.066
Skylar?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.260
You go that way. You go that way.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.746
- Skylar?
- Skylar?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.941
Where are you?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.021
Skylar?

17:01.560 --> 17:02.661
Skylar?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.060
He's dead. He won't bite.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.665
Sam.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.382
Yeah, I was kind of looking for...

17:25.280 --> 17:26.381
Skylar?

17:26.960 --> 17:28.060
Skylar?

17:30.400 --> 17:34.744
Skylar? Skylar? Skylar? Sky!

17:38.400 --> 17:40.740
- What's going on?
- There's got to be a Bible in here somewhere.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.704
I'm gonna prove to you
guys what's going on.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.425
Five rows over.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.426
Sky, what are you doing?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.948
Storm's passed. We need to find Ally.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.266
Skylar, seriously?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.789
Is this what you wanted?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.060
See this?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.149
- Is that a Bible?
- Yes, it's a Bible, Jack.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.943
- It's not in here.
- What?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.461
Rapture. It's not in here.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.420
- Rapture?
- Hail.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.827
- She's looking for Rapture.
- Hail. Hail.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.591
Bro, come on. We gotta get Ally.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.346
Hail.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.625
"When the first one blew his trumpet,
there came hail and fire mixed with blood."

18:34.840 --> 18:36.669
Sky, that's not helping.
That's not helping us.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.100
I shouldn't be here. I went to church.
I did everything right.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.825
You'll be okay. We're gonna be okay.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.147
Stop.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.664
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.064
Let's get out of here.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.180
- You guys, please! We can't leave!
- We're going to 45 North.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.940
We're not going. No!
You don't understand.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.223
- We can't go out there.
- She might be at the church on Camp Street.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.945
She texted you 45 North.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.700
You're right. You're right.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.300
But I know she likes to go to that
church when she's upset and I'm...

19:06.400 --> 19:08.180
When does Ally go to church, Tommy?

19:08.280 --> 19:09.900
Every time you guys get in
a fight, she ends up there.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.580
- What are you talking about?
- I'm her best friend.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.784
- It's a new thing for her.
- We're going to 45 North.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.220
The church is closer, all right?
And it's on the way.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.780
- I think we should maybe check it out.
- What are you guys talking about?

19:19.880 --> 19:22.665
- We have to stay here where it's safe.
- Fine. We're gonna go to the church.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.181
We're staying.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.660
Sky, this place isn't safe, all right?
What if there's another earthquake?

19:31.760 --> 19:33.624
There's no food. There's no supplies.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.420
- We gotta get going, we gotta stay together.
- No, I'm not going.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.384
There's safety in numbers.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.145
He's right. We should go.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.701
Wait, "we"?

19:48.080 --> 19:49.261
Yeah, we.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.381
All right, well,
we gotta get moving. Let's go.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.268
- This is a bad idea.
- We have to stay together.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.381
Come on.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.184
The church is on the
other side of First...

20:44.160 --> 20:45.421
What is going on?

20:46.720 --> 20:48.060
What could have brought
down these planes?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.705
Do you believe me now?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.430
Stay together. Stay together, guys.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.149
- Is the church up ahead?
- Come on. Keep moving, guys.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.309
Okay, where is everybody?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.580
Where are the people? What's that?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.030
It's the carriage to our...

21:35.640 --> 21:37.105
I don't understand.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.620
Dear God, please help me.
I don't understand what's going on.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.780
What are you doing?

21:44.880 --> 21:48.460
- Sky, praying isn't gonna help us.
- I'm sorry for not believing in...

21:48.560 --> 21:50.980
- Can you hold up?
- We gotta keep moving, Dan.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.580
- Come on.
- It's gonna be okay. All right?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.140
- Please.
- Keep moving.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.220
- Just don't let go of me, okay?
- I won't.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.910
Did you hear that?

22:00.040 --> 22:01.380
No.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.025
Exactly. It just got quiet.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.745
- What was that sound?
- I don't know. Let's keep moving.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.146
Something's wrong.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.670
Something's wrong.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.380
Something just flew by. Feel that?

22:29.480 --> 22:30.741
God, please be with us.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.780
Keep going.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.664
Lord, we really need you right now.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.340
Something's in the tree.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.065
What is that?

22:43.280 --> 22:46.065
I didn't let go. I didn't let go!
She was right here.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.060
She was right here! I didn't let go!
I didn't let go!

22:49.160 --> 22:50.180
What are you talking about?
Where did she go?

22:50.280 --> 22:51.381
Dan!

22:52.000 --> 22:53.181
Sky?

22:54.120 --> 22:55.824
Skylar! Skylar!

22:59.160 --> 23:00.671
The church is right there!

23:02.080 --> 23:04.421
Let's get inside! Go, go, go!

23:07.960 --> 23:10.028
Help! Help!

23:12.200 --> 23:13.347
Hey!

23:15.560 --> 23:16.900
Help!

23:17.800 --> 23:19.580
Get in. Get in.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.270
Is she all right?

23:23.800 --> 23:26.100
Do you know what did this to her?
Do you know what's happening?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.461
You dropped this.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.150
All the words are missing.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.024
Let's get her into the sanctuary.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.100
Help them, Doug. Sanctuary, please.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.143
Inside. Inside.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.060
- Put me down. Put me down.
- Are we gonna be safe in here?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.388
Yes. I think so.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.060
I'm Pastor Shay. And you are?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.060
- Tommy. This is Jack.
- Tommy. Jack.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.300
- Sam.
- Sam, Skylar, Dan.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.468
Let's get some help for your friend.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.470
I'll find Nurse Rachel.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.500
Rachel! Nurse Rachel! We need help!

24:00.600 --> 24:02.782
- Ally?
- Jack!

24:05.520 --> 24:07.668
Jack! Tommy!

24:08.600 --> 24:10.190
Sky! Is she hurt?

24:10.880 --> 24:13.506
She's okay. Are you okay?

24:13.880 --> 24:15.106
You came looking for me.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.260
I tried to call. Everything was dead.

24:18.360 --> 24:21.828
- It's okay. It's okay.
- How did you know I was here?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.666
Tommy.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.668
Where's Lauren? Where's everyone else?

24:32.000 --> 24:35.149
They're dead, honey. They're all dead.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.305
I'm sorry, honey.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.670
What happened?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.465
What did this to her?

24:54.800 --> 24:56.584
We need to clean out that wound.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.784
Looks like a stab wound.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.022
It's okay. It's okay.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.708
Remember when you
walked into Jack's party?

25:21.960 --> 25:24.381
My jaw literally dropped. Yeah.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.823
I never saw anybody so
beautiful in my whole life.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.070
I love you, Ms. Gardner.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.300
I'm gonna have to lift
the arm to reset it.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.626
Mrs. Gardner.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.347
Ready?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.790
Good. Now the left side.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.621
- Can we maybe give her a minute?
- No. Just do it.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.900
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.500
You remember when we went
to go get our marriage license

25:52.600 --> 25:54.782
and the office was over that crazy deli?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.588
We had to wait for a copy
looking at pig's feet.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.387
Hey. Hey. Hey.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.864
It's okay. It's okay.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.342
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

26:41.160 --> 26:42.466
The Rapture.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.782
Right out of the New
Testament of the Bible.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.346
Come on.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.780
You mean the thingy where Jesus
teleports the good to heaven...

26:56.880 --> 26:58.061
The believers.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.750
- ...and leaves us heathens...
- The nonbelievers.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.261
We are all presented
with the same evidence.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.545
I guess it's

27:16.120 --> 27:18.700
what conclusion you
wish to draw from it.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.380
I don't draw anything from it.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.503
What do you think attacked your friend?

27:27.240 --> 27:29.183
Aliens, maybe. I don't know.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.831
I can't really explain it.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.706
Aliens?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.102
We'll find out soon enough.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.469
There's more survivors coming in.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.264
- Bring them inside.
- One of them's pregnant.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.180
- Wet some towels.
- It's all right. Just breathe.

28:05.280 --> 28:09.460
Remember, breathe. Breathe.
There we go. Breathe.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.344
- One more.
- Hold my hand.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.900
Yes!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.387
One last one. One last one.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.905
It's a boy.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.543
Can I hold him? Please?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.422
Can I hold him? Please?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.344
Why isn't he crying?

29:12.520 --> 29:14.110
Follow me.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.951
You...

29:33.680 --> 29:35.669
You knew the baby was
gonna be a stillborn.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.186
I knew.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.991
He was an innocent.

29:45.840 --> 29:50.502
Why would God kill all these
people and an innocent baby?

29:50.640 --> 29:52.151
He didn't.

29:53.600 --> 29:58.308
He left their mortal bodies
behind and he took their souls.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.186
That baby, he didn't get death.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.545
He got eternal life. Bliss.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.591
I was at home with my family
when they all were taken.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.980
Then I heard the first trumpet.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.467
- First trumpet?
- You didn't hear it?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.390
I froze.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.024
Knew instantly.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.548
And all I could think
to do was come here.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.466
I'm sorry for your loss.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.190
Wasn't my loss. It was their gain.

30:53.840 --> 30:54.987
Why weren't you taken?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.543
Why wasn't I taken?

30:58.880 --> 31:04.066
You know, just because you
have a church and a title

31:05.800 --> 31:07.231
doesn't mean that you have real faith.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.150
I had no relationship.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.750
I just had comfort.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.788
And that is how I failed.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.260
All right, guys, come on, come on.
Circle up. Circle up.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.349
All right, all of us. Come on.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.625
- So how's Skylar?
- She's all right.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.949
Ally and Dan are back there with her.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.030
So what do you want to do?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.300
Hole up here.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.860
Hole up here? Hole up here until what?

32:15.960 --> 32:17.740
We don't know what's going on out there.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.740
So at least in here it
seems like we're safe.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.340
So you just wanna sit in
here and see what happens?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.260
Until we figure out a
better plan, Tommy.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.260
Maybe we should move,
find another place.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.464
To where?
Can't exactly move Skylar, can we?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.629
Let me in! Let me in!

32:40.240 --> 32:41.990
Help me! Help me!

32:54.240 --> 32:56.140
My name's Tommy Covington.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.549
If you are watching this,
then I'm probably dead.

33:00.400 --> 33:05.745
It's been 10 hours since everything started,
and we made it to a church, found help.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.140
If anything happens, Ally,
there's something I wanna...

33:13.240 --> 33:14.865
I wanna say.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.540
What are you doing?
I don't like people filming me.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.820
Says the guy filming everyone.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.751
So, what's so important
you need to tell Ally?

33:29.200 --> 33:31.302
- It's complicated.
- Complicated.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.580
Don't you think fire and ice falling
from the sky should uncomplicate things?

33:35.680 --> 33:38.021
Yeah. Probably.

33:38.520 --> 33:39.985
Then tell her what you wanted to say.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.224
I'll show it to her
if something happens.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.911
Allison, I...

33:59.640 --> 34:01.742
When I met you seven years ago,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.380
we just clicked.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.740
Truth is,

34:07.840 --> 34:11.262
I've loved you every day since.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.581
And if it's not me,

34:21.239 --> 34:23.627
I just want you to be happy.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.223
I just want you to be happy.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.545
Feel better?

34:40.280 --> 34:44.940
Video footage has been streaming
in on a worldwide mysterious illness

34:45.040 --> 34:46.380
that strikes without warning

34:46.480 --> 34:49.219
and has caused millions of
fatalities in the past hour.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.184
Oh, my God. Geez.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.110
People are...

34:53.320 --> 34:55.866
- Help!
- Say something.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.380
This isn't right.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.742
This isn't happening. What in...

35:01.760 --> 35:03.660
Leading experts from around the globe

35:03.760 --> 35:07.580
have been unable to determine
the cause of what is being labeled

35:07.680 --> 35:09.623
"instant death syndrome."

35:12.920 --> 35:15.060
The syndrome strikes without warning

35:15.160 --> 35:19.584
and has universally caused death
in children and infants worldwide

35:20.040 --> 35:23.220
as well as random segments
of the adult population.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.700
- Are you okay?
- The car's on fire.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.981
Get the extinguisher!

35:30.240 --> 35:32.020
- What's going on?
- We need help over here!

35:32.120 --> 35:34.100
Give me a hand! She's hurt!

35:34.200 --> 35:36.340
- Are you okay?
- She's not breathing.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.065
Go get it, Max. Yeah.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.268
Talk to me. Are you guys okay?

35:44.240 --> 35:47.460
We will continue to upload
videos as the story progresses

35:47.560 --> 35:51.665
and we'll bring you breaking updates
as soon as we have them.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.660
I'm so sorry about how
I left the reception.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.460
It's okay.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.860
It seems pretty stupid now.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.188
I'm sorry that I was
the reason you left.

36:03.080 --> 36:06.821
You came looking for me.
That's all that matters.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.502
So how long you been
going to this church?

36:13.720 --> 36:15.540
About six months.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.471
I don't know, it's not like an
every Sunday thing or anything.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.709
How come you never told me?

36:22.240 --> 36:25.150
I knew you'd laugh. Or roll your eyes.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.510
Yeah, I probably would've.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.227
Then.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.865
Not anymore.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.304
Surprise!

36:52.280 --> 36:55.065
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Mom!

36:55.640 --> 36:57.260
We got you.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.950
Happy birthday!

37:00.840 --> 37:04.342
I love you all so much,
and you're so wonderful.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.784
So where are your parents?

37:10.080 --> 37:11.306
Killed.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.587
Taken. Whatever they're calling it.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.426
Sorry.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.741
I hope you don't mind crunchy.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.628
You wanna add anaphylactic
shock to our day?

37:26.280 --> 37:27.506
I'm allergic.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.430
Note to self. Note to self.

37:33.400 --> 37:37.069
So, why are you here?
You're obviously a good person.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.149
I am a good person.
Just not a churchy good person.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.988
- You never went?
- I'm not really a "sit in a pew" kind of girl.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.184
Guess I blew that one.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.982
Yeah, yeah, I guess I did, too.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.988
Are you this comforting all the time?

38:00.520 --> 38:02.190
No, no, just...

38:03.840 --> 38:05.863
Just when the world's ending.

38:08.360 --> 38:12.380
We have received several eyewitness
accounts of unusual weather patterns.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.740
Reports and images from around the world
are both troubling and foreboding.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.380
The National Weather Service
has issued storm warnings

38:19.480 --> 38:22.100
and travel advisories
from coast to coast

38:22.200 --> 38:25.940
in the wake of this
unprecedented devastation.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.500
Federal, state and local officials

38:28.600 --> 38:32.060
are asking all individuals
to stay indoors.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.620
Stay in your homes for the time being.

38:34.720 --> 38:39.064
Safety is of utmost importance
at this very unpredictable time.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.031
We're safe, okay? We're almost...

39:07.080 --> 39:09.069
I don't know what I was waiting for.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.547
I think I was waiting for a sign,
some "eureka" moment to happen.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.747
And all you gotta do is make a choice.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.665
I love you.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.390
I love you.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.501
And I know

39:35.000 --> 39:36.943
that I wanna marry you.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.588
Guys. You gotta see this.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.030
I was filming and I caught it on tape.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.826
I didn't let go. I didn't let go!
She was right here!

39:54.840 --> 39:57.261
- May I see what you're looking at?
- Yeah.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.900
Revelations 9.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.540
I didn't let go!

40:04.640 --> 40:07.983
And the fifth angel sounded his
trumpet and opened the abyss.

40:08.560 --> 40:12.790
The sun and sky were darkened
and locusts fell upon the earth.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.469
Their hair was like women's hair,
their teeth were like lion's teeth,

40:19.120 --> 40:20.620
and their wings made the sound

40:20.720 --> 40:23.664
like the thundering of many
horses rushing into battle.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.580
Look, you can see it when
I go frame to frame.

40:28.680 --> 40:33.183
They were given stingers like that
of scorpions to torment people.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.951
What is this thing?

40:41.320 --> 40:42.865
One of the fallen.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.340
And what do they want?

40:45.440 --> 40:47.941
To torture. To destroy.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.630
Can we fight them?

40:52.880 --> 40:54.141
No.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.910
This is the first season
of bad things to come.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.825
What, the first?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.988
It's only gonna get worse.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.341
- It's not right.
- What's not right, baby?

41:08.880 --> 41:10.220
How do you feel?

41:10.640 --> 41:12.060
I've given you the last dose of Vicodin,

41:12.160 --> 41:14.700
so your pain should come down
just a little bit. Okay, sweetie?

41:14.800 --> 41:16.780
No. Don't touch that.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.980
- Let me look. Just let me look.
- No, stop. It's burning.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.820
- No, it's okay.
- Please, no, it's burning.

41:20.920 --> 41:25.503
I gotta get up. Stop! I wanna get...
Get out of here.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.900
- I gotta get out of here!
- Calm down. It's okay.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.501
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.740
Listen to me.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.342
It's already getting infected, and I don't
have any antibiotics in here to help her.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.820
Where do I get her the
medicine she needs?

41:38.920 --> 41:42.020
My car. I have some sample
packets of amoxicillin,

41:42.120 --> 41:44.791
but it's just too dangerous
to go out there.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.101
- Give me the keys.
- It's not safe to go out there.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.667
I'm going with you.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.630
I'll go too.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.710
We got this.

41:57.720 --> 41:58.867
Let's go.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.748
It's a green Chrysler minivan
blocked in on the Sixth Street side.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.230
Just out of the parking lot.

42:09.800 --> 42:13.222
- There's an SUV there, I think.
- Wait. You think?

42:14.040 --> 42:16.268
I'm sorry. I got blocked in.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.988
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll find it. It's okay.

42:19.440 --> 42:20.985
Keys?

42:22.600 --> 42:23.701
Thanks.

42:27.720 --> 42:32.621
Listen. The sample packets of amoxicillin
are in a duffel bag at the back of my van.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.743
Hey, you sure you don't want me to go?

42:36.680 --> 42:38.111
No, we're good.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.582
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.827
You hear that?

43:42.400 --> 43:44.502
You should get in the
church where it's safe.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.190
- Here's the SUV.
- Here it is!

43:57.640 --> 43:58.900
- Unlock it.
- Why isn't it opening?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.625
Unlock it!

44:01.640 --> 44:02.741
I have an idea.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.945
Tommy, lights!

44:21.480 --> 44:22.820
I know what's going on!

44:22.920 --> 44:24.980
Don't believe what the
government is feeding you.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.420
There was no viral outbreak.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.740
- Turn that off!
- No terrorist attack.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.500
There are millions of
dead all around us.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.660
All the children are dead.
This was the Rapture.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.980
You need to understand that
there is only one way to God.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.580
Only one way to eternal life.
You listen to me.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.021
- Stop what you're doing, get down on your...
- I got it, I got it!

44:46.400 --> 44:48.867
Something hit the front.
Something hit the front.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.590
You don't act for God.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.100
The power of Christ compels you!

45:30.200 --> 45:31.665
Run! Go!

45:37.640 --> 45:39.708
Run, Tommy! Come on, Tommy, come on!

45:42.400 --> 45:43.740
They're coming.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.900
Run, Tommy! Run!

45:45.000 --> 45:47.580
Run! Run! Run!

45:47.680 --> 45:49.111
Open the door!

45:49.640 --> 45:50.821
Tommy!

45:56.520 --> 46:00.022
You made it. Oh, good.
You got it. You got it.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.428
What do you want to say to camera?

46:22.960 --> 46:26.143
I don't know. Like a confession?

46:26.280 --> 46:28.621
Sure. Yeah.
Get something off your chest.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.630
I don't have anything to confess.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.301
What do you want to say, Jack?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.065
Tommy, why are you still filming?

46:40.480 --> 46:41.980
'Cause if we don't make it out of this,

46:42.080 --> 46:44.380
- somebody needs to know what happened.
- Don't say that.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.389
We're gonna make it out of this, okay?

47:01.080 --> 47:03.023
My name is Jack Turner.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.664
I don't know why this is happening.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.385
Don't know why.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.222
But it's not gonna beat me.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.900
I'm not ready to call it quits.
I don't know why you're filming.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.181
Tommy, come on!

47:23.760 --> 47:25.669
Do you love Allison?

47:26.440 --> 47:27.621
Of course.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.543
And it's taken you seven
years to figure that out?

47:31.560 --> 47:34.340
- What?
- I just want to know how you feel.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.030
Tommy, what are you doing?

47:36.600 --> 47:39.540
I almost lost her today.
How do you think that feels, Tommy?

47:39.640 --> 47:42.340
So it takes losing her
to feel something?

47:42.440 --> 47:44.980
That's not love, Jack. She deserves
somebody who loves her, all right?

47:45.080 --> 47:47.340
- She's a great girl. Seven years?
- What?

47:47.440 --> 47:49.220
- Seven years?
- Stop it.

47:49.320 --> 47:51.100
Do you know what I think it is, Tommy?

47:51.200 --> 47:53.300
I think you got a confession
you need to make, Tommy.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.300
- Guys! Guys!
- So go on. Say it.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.660
- I don't have one.
- Come on. Say it.

47:58.760 --> 47:59.780
- Say what?
- Say it!

47:59.880 --> 48:01.020
- Don't!
- Say what?

48:01.120 --> 48:02.500
You hang out with her all day.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.580
- Guys, stop. Stop. Stop.
- You don't date.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.820
- So say it, Tommy!
- Say what?

48:05.920 --> 48:08.900
It's not so fun now that
I got the camera, is it?

48:09.000 --> 48:10.420
Say it.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.031
- Say it, Tommy.
- Stop it.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.871
Fine.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.465
Fine.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.980
I love you, Allison.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.340
- I knew it.
- What?

48:31.440 --> 48:35.060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.060
Jack, stop it! Guys, stop it!

48:37.160 --> 48:39.149
Stop! Now! Stop!

48:41.560 --> 48:43.788
- Katie Murphy.
- What?

48:49.640 --> 48:54.507
It was after the LSU-Alabama game.
I drove Katie home.

48:55.560 --> 48:59.790
And it was just a moment.
We just got caught up in it.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.066
We both did, and it happened.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.622
I tried to tell her
before we got married.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.149
She deserves to know the truth, right?

49:10.520 --> 49:13.669
Dan, it doesn't matter now.

49:14.320 --> 49:18.584
Everything matters now.
Don't you see that?

49:24.560 --> 49:25.991
I'm sorry.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.222
So, Tommy, confession time
was a good idea.

49:32.400 --> 49:35.743
What'd we learn from that?
You're an idiot.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.341
This is an emergency notification alert.

49:43.240 --> 49:46.620
During this emergency,
please seek shelter immediately.

49:46.720 --> 49:50.140
Do not leave your home,
and avoid going out at night.

49:50.240 --> 49:53.300
If you are unable to survive
under your current conditions,

49:53.400 --> 49:57.780
search for a place of refuge set up
by civil and military authorities.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.540
Civil and military authorities

49:59.640 --> 50:02.660
are establishing relief centers
in major metropolitan areas.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.260
- You okay?
- All broadcast and cable systems

50:05.360 --> 50:07.380
shall transmit this
emergency alert message...

50:07.480 --> 50:09.070
Yeah, I'm fine.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.422
Let's see how she's doing.

50:36.440 --> 50:38.224
There's nothing I can do for her.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.460
- The antibiotics aren't working.
- What do you mean?

50:47.560 --> 50:51.028
The infection, it's spreading.
It's acting like a venom.

50:51.800 --> 50:55.860
You said she needed antibiotics,
and now you're saying you're not sure.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.780
I've never seen anything
like this before.

50:57.880 --> 51:02.065
She needs an antivenom like
Anascorp or a doctor who can help.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.671
I'm sorry.

51:10.560 --> 51:13.180
- I'm going to the hospital.
- No, wait, wait.

51:13.280 --> 51:15.220
It's on the other side of
the freeway, all right?

51:15.320 --> 51:18.583
On the other side of the freeway?
We almost didn't make it 30 feet.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.140
I know it's not a good plan, all right,
but we got to save Sky.

51:22.240 --> 51:25.180
- It's a couple hours till dawn.
- What does that have to do with anything?

51:25.280 --> 51:29.220
Listen, those things, okay, whatever they are,
they've only attacked at night.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.945
Maybe they're nocturnal.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.151
Does she even have a couple hours?

51:36.040 --> 51:37.620
She's a fighter.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.983
She's fought it this long.
I'd wait until morning.

51:44.440 --> 51:47.669
Pastor Shay wants to talk
to everyone in the sanctuary.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.102
We leave for the hospital the
second the sun comes up.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.791
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.987
Come in.

52:16.440 --> 52:19.589
You know, that was the first
real prayer I ever said.

52:22.120 --> 52:25.110
Do you have any idea
how powerful it feels?

52:26.520 --> 52:27.781
Can't say that I do.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.789
It's not too late for us to believe, Tommy.
God still loves us all.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.180
And if I do make it...

52:35.280 --> 52:40.511
If we make it out of this mess,
we'll be raptured?

52:42.560 --> 52:46.551
No. The Rapture is over.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.910
- We missed that boat.
- Well, that's no good.

52:54.320 --> 52:58.141
But we have hope in the path to the
Father and his gift of eternal life.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.702
You have to make a choice, Tommy.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.588
And what are you going to do?

53:08.080 --> 53:11.024
I'm going to be a pastor
for the first time in my life.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.151
For those of you whom I
haven't met, I am Pastor Shay.

53:35.480 --> 53:36.991
And I have been a fraud.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.185
It's true.

53:40.440 --> 53:43.749
I walk through this sanctuary
with my soul asleep.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.781
In Matthew, Jesus said

53:48.680 --> 53:53.700
there will be those who use his name
in fancy speeches and sermons,

53:53.800 --> 53:56.187
and Jesus said unto them,

53:59.880 --> 54:01.220
"I never knew you."

54:04.520 --> 54:06.941
Forgive me, Jesus. I never knew you.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.420
I was a charlatan.

54:11.480 --> 54:16.427
I was a traveling salesman passing
through life hocking his wares.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.591
Like you and you.

54:23.120 --> 54:27.066
I needed something miraculous
to open my eyes to the truth.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.670
To see clearly.

54:30.840 --> 54:35.628
I hold myself responsible
not only for my failed faith,

54:36.200 --> 54:39.543
but everyone yet still
stands here today.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.462
This is our wake-up call.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.420
The path before us will not be easy.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.304
It will not go unchallenged.

54:50.240 --> 54:54.664
And this path will lead to pain
and suffering, even death.

54:55.360 --> 54:59.181
But real life, eternal life,
is where the path leads.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.631
But this is our opportunity.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.542
I can now show you the way.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.820
We can share this journey together.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.827
Everyone, get to the basement!

55:34.360 --> 55:37.828
Come on! Keep running! Keep running!
Keep running! Keep up with me!

55:49.600 --> 55:52.783
- Where's Rachel?
- Has anyone seen Nurse Rachel?

55:53.680 --> 55:56.260
Is Rachel in here? Rachel?

56:00.160 --> 56:01.830
It's right above us.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.662
Tommy? Tommy, what is it?

56:10.440 --> 56:12.224
Everyone be quiet.

56:14.800 --> 56:15.947
Sam.

56:29.440 --> 56:30.905
Rachel!

56:32.120 --> 56:35.269
- Help me! Help me!
- Rachel! Rachel!

56:36.560 --> 56:37.661
Rachel!

56:38.160 --> 56:41.503
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

57:06.960 --> 57:08.425
Forgive me.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.664
There's only one way out.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.145
They're here for me.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.743
Shay, don't go out there. No, Shay!

57:27.840 --> 57:30.307
Please. Please.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.824
I don't hear anything.

57:53.560 --> 57:54.900
I'm gonna open the door.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.306
- You ready?
- Yeah.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.830
Come on, Sky.

58:12.520 --> 58:15.021
The sun's up. Let's get to the hospital.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.504
Baby, do you smell that?

59:22.920 --> 59:25.751
Look at me. Hey. All right?

59:26.360 --> 59:28.269
Don't look. Come on.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.541
I think it's okay. Come on.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.984
This is crazy.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.506
Hey, there's nothing that way.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.511
It's gone.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.460
Come on, let's just get
to the relief center.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.742
Where are these people going?

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.430
Let's find you a room.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.785
There's got to be a doctor here.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.546
Help her.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.667
- Please. Please help her.
- We're getting out of here.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.386
There's a relief center
at the Riverfront Bridge.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.231
There's nothing. Nothing.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.900
- You got her?
- Yeah.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.465
The place has been ransacked,
cleaned out.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.344
There's nothing in that pharmacy.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.901
Guys, there's nothing left.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.540
Hey. I'm gonna go upstairs
and find her a doctor, okay?

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.380
Someone who can help.
There has got to be a doctor here.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.787
I'm gonna go with him.
Sam, Sam, you stay here, okay?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.221
Tommy.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.985
Be careful.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.661
Jack!

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.270
Jack, wait up.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.061
Jack.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.306
Jack!

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.902
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I need this.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.180
I can handle this on my own, Tommy.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.950
Yeah, I know.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.904
I read somewhere that the
light you see before you die

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.703
is just your brain releasing massive amounts
of endorphins to ease the pain of death.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.502
Some people believe that.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.509
There are others that believe the
light is a sign of God's existence.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.629
Do you believe that?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.181
I do.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.946
Son of a...

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.500
Why do you have to get to a point where
something's going to be taken from you

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.101
for you to realize how important it is?

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.067
No need to explain. I know you love her.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.706
Yeah.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.780
Yeah.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.264
Did you hear that?

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.421
Did you hear that?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.870
Did you hear that? What was that?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.340
One,

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.180
two,

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.427
three.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.550
Let's keep going.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.544
Hi, sweetie.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.625
Hey.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.110
I'm right here.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.910
I'm right here.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.383
Are you still hurting?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.782
I don't really feel anything.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.386
I forgive you for everything.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.270
- How did you...
- I heard you.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.270
I love you.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.381
Dan...

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.550
Where I grew up

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.582
if you didn't go to church,
people looked at you funny.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.548
So that's what I did.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.301
I never really believed.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.144
And that's okay.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.185
I get it now.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.350
I love you.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.189
Do you see that?

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.663
It's so bright.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.384
It's beautiful.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.550
No, please.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.500
Stay with me, Sky. Please stay with me.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.304
Hey. Hey.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.510
Don't leave me.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.589
Somebody help her, please!

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.311
Dan, there's no one here to help her.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.748
How can you sit there

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.741
and pray to a god that would
let this happen to her?

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.384
She was your friend.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.787
Dan!

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.469
Will you do something for me?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.261
I was wrong, and I realize that now.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.020
I spent my whole life telling
myself that I was spiritual

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.302
and that was enough.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.230
Obviously, that didn't work out too well.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.541
I hate you!

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.184
- I hate you!
- What's Dan doing?

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.143
I hate you, you hear me?

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.380
Come on! Give it to me! I'm right here!

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.940
- Dan!
- Dan, stop!

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.500
- I hate you!
- Dan, no!

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.862
- Give it to me, God!
- Dan, stop!

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.861
God, are you even listening to me?

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.785
Please.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.261
No, Dan!

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.460
We don't have much
time left on this earth.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.503
We have to make a decision.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.621
Ally?

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.061
Ally?

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.820
Oh, no.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.820
Listen, maybe they're looking for us.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.741
This way.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.186
Ally?

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.820
Ally?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.590
No, please.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.220
Go! Sam, run! Run! Run! Don't look back!
Don't look back! Just go!

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.945
Just go!

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.340
She's not here! Ally's not there.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.464
Tommy, what do you see? What's wrong?

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.260
Oh, God, no.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.621
No, no.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.020
I was hiding.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.620
They didn't get me. I was so scared!

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.420
You're okay. You're okay.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.780
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.186
Let's go.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.386
Listen, we got to go.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.300
We need to get to the relief center.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.025
I'm not leaving her.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.660
You can go.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.700
No, you were my best friends
and I will not leave you.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.340
- I'm not leaving her! You can go!
- No.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.030
No, I won't.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.068
- Just go.
- No.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.706
Jack, she's gone.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.864
I mean it. Go.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.500
She's...

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.384
Shut up!

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.024
Stop! Stop!

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.060
- Get off of him!
- There's nothing out there that I want.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.740
Do you understand that?
Do you understand?

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.465
Then I'm staying, too.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.062
So take all the time you need.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.187
We'll stay as long as it takes.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.340
Do you think we'll be safe there?

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.900
The military must be at
the Riverfront Bridge.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.104
They'll have food, supplies.
They'll know what to do.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.547
There it is.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.740
The governor has issued an edict

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.468
asking all nonmilitary personnel
to check in at the main gate.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.980
Food, shelter, donated clothing
and medical supplies

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.940
are available to all those in need.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.100
For those with more serious
medical conditions,

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.100
please report to the triage area
outside our hospital tent,

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.260
where you can be evaluated
and treated in a timely manner.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.780
If you have any further questions,

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.622
please ask any uniformed military
personnel stationed throughout the area.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.660
You think that's where they're
setting up the church?

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.908
I heard they're bringing in a chaplain.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.343
It's the group from the church.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.788
You made it. Welcome.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.310
Come and get warm.
Warm yourself here, huh?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.590
It's good to see you.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.431
Now what?

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.902
Get in line right over there.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.707
Please get this to the chapel.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.621
I need to show you guys something.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.901
I was wrong, and I realize that now.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.380
I spent my whole life telling
myself that I was spiritual

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.389
and that that was enough.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.828
Obviously, that didn't
work out too well.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.025
But now,

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.704
I found real faith.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:54.271
These demons are here to
remove the Word of God.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.626
Don't you see?

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.581
It has to be the truth.
Even they recognize it.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.067
We all have to make a choice.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.581
We can choose to accept and believe

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.820
and get life like we've never known it,

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.662
or continue to live selfishly,
ignoring God,

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.103
and end up dying anyway.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.381
We all have to make a choice.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.508
We don't have much
time left on this earth.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.384
You have to make a decision.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.869
I choose God.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.667
Go! Go! Sam, run! Run! Run!

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.863
- Is he going to be okay?
- Give him some time.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.901
Faith.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.787
What'd you say?

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.311
They're drawn to faith.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.427
We got to find Jack.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.547
Wait! Tommy!

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.020
Turn off the music!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.700
Where's the PA? Where's the PA?
Turn off the music.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.227
Turn the music off!

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.827
Baptism is an outward sign
of an inward commitment.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.701
Jack!

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.580
It's also like taking the witness stand
to declare the truth of the Gospel

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.066
to all who are present.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.866
They're coming!

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.027
Jack!

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.546
Sam!

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.026
Sam!

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.940
Sam!

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.911
Sam, I got you. I got you.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.545
There's only one way, Tommy.
We have to make a choice.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.422
Jack did. Allison did.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.989
And I think they made the right one.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.547
The choice is ours, Tommy.
It always has been.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.630
Listen, don't go.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.984
I choose God, Tommy. You should, too.
