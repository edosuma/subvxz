WEBVTT

00:00.987 --> 00:02.029
<i>KEVIN: I can't believe it, Doc. I mean...</i>

00:02.068 --> 00:04.721
low testosterone ...
that doesn't seem like me.

00:04.857 --> 00:06.878
See, I feel like I could
eyeball it as soon as

00:06.879 --> 00:09.027
you walked in the office.
And the tests confirm it.

00:09.145 --> 00:13.531
I'm gonna give you a
prescription for a ... a gel.

00:13.649 --> 00:16.534
I want you to rub that on your
upper arms twice a day.

00:16.652 --> 00:18.536
- Andro-Lube?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.654 --> 00:20.538
- What is this?
- It is a highly-concentrated

00:20.656 --> 00:22.624
- testosterone replacement gel.
- So, I just take this, rub it

00:22.741 --> 00:24.626
- on my shoulders?
- That's correct.

00:24.743 --> 00:26.711
- How much do I put on?
- Based on these results,

00:26.829 --> 00:28.797
- I would go to town.
- Okay.

00:28.914 --> 00:30.965
Just more than an average
person might use.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.384
Wouldn't it make more sense
just to put it right

00:33.502 --> 00:35.503
- on the root of the problem?
- It might seem that way to

00:35.671 --> 00:38.973
a layman, but that is just not how
the human body works.

00:39.091 --> 00:41.509
- I think it does.
- Let me explain it to you

00:41.677 --> 00:43.511
as I might explain it to a child.
If you had a headache ...

00:43.679 --> 00:45.396
- Mm-hmm.
- ... you wouldn't rub the

00:45.514 --> 00:47.398
aspirin on your temples, would you?

00:47.516 --> 00:49.067
- No, because it wouldn't work.
- It wouldn't work.

00:49.185 --> 00:50.401
- No.
- You see? Mm-hmm.

00:50.519 --> 00:52.153
Okay, all right.
Well, are there gonna be any

00:52.271 --> 00:55.240
- adverse side effects for me?
- No, just boners.

00:55.357 --> 00:57.492
I can live with that.
You know I'm gonna put this on

00:57.610 --> 01:00.528
- my penis, right?
- I was almost certain of it.

01:00.879 --> 01:03.879
<b>6x02 - Tefl-Andre</b>

01:04.416 --> 01:06.117
<i>PETE: So I found a detail in Ted's will.</i>

01:06.252 --> 01:09.204
It turns out, we get the beach
house only if we replace him.

01:09.338 --> 01:11.256
Yeah, we just need to get
another member, that's all.

01:11.373 --> 01:13.258
Which we have to do anyway.
We can't play with seven teams.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.260
I mean, eight is sad enough as it is.

01:15.377 --> 01:17.128
JENNY: Yeah, and we have got
to goose up this competition, you guys.

01:17.263 --> 01:22.050
- Chuck is in and out of rehab, Taco ...
- TACO: Has been very busy with

01:22.218 --> 01:24.052
the EBDB. Thank you
for that introduction.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.187
Now, I know this league's
looking for another warm body,

01:26.305 --> 01:28.973
but more importantly, Taco
Corp's board is looking for

01:29.108 --> 01:31.059
a new member.
One of our founding board

01:31.227 --> 01:33.645
members, Doke, drowned
in a sewer last week.

01:33.779 --> 01:35.647
- Jesus.
- ANDRE: Oh, not Doke.

01:35.781 --> 01:37.732
Told him not to live there,
but he loved his toy boat, so

01:37.867 --> 01:40.535
what can you do?
Now, as you know, Taco Corp's

01:40.653 --> 01:43.488
board is not like this league.
It doesn't take just anybody.

01:43.622 --> 01:45.490
- Then how did you get in?
- Exactly my point.

01:45.624 --> 01:47.492
Taco Corp has to be better than this.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.494
- Better than this!
- Stop it!

01:49.628 --> 01:51.546
Let me tell you about the best of the best.

01:51.664 --> 01:53.548
Let's talk about my team.
Guys, are you nervous, excited?

01:53.666 --> 01:55.550
- I'm shocked.
- I'm bewildered.

01:55.668 --> 01:57.252
Yeah. I mean, you didn't
draft a punter in the first

01:57.386 --> 02:00.638
- round. You didn't draft one commentator.
- I know. I thought for sure

02:00.756 --> 02:02.507
- you'd take Randy Moss.
- Andre has turned over a newleaf.

02:02.641 --> 02:06.344
Everything in my life is changing.
Success in all endeavors.

02:06.478 --> 02:08.346
- RUXIN: Andre.
- ALL: Hey!

02:08.479 --> 02:10.348
- How was the game?
- Okay.

02:10.482 --> 02:13.351
Yeah. They got Geoffrey
playing a new, awesome position

02:13.485 --> 02:15.353
- called deep right field.
- Well, you know what the

02:15.487 --> 02:19.616
problem is? That mitt looks pretty
stiff. You know, maybe you got

02:19.617 --> 02:23.745
to get some oils and just really
massage it, get it a little loose.

02:23.862 --> 02:25.997
You know, like, pound the
palm so it feels like it's just

02:26.115 --> 02:28.299
- gonna kind of explode ...
- Okay.

02:28.434 --> 02:29.634
- Andre.
- Okay.

02:29.768 --> 02:31.636
Geoffrey, so you needed
to use the bathroom, bud?

02:31.770 --> 02:33.121
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he needs to wash away

02:33.289 --> 02:35.123
- your words.
- It's right down the hall.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.592
- Splash the seat, okay?
- Hey!

02:37.710 --> 02:40.545
Honestly, I'll be lucky
if he can even hit the seat.

02:40.679 --> 02:43.848
The kid is wildly uncoordinated.
He's got no feel for the game.

02:43.966 --> 02:45.934
- He's got real weak arms.
- What do you expect?

02:46.018 --> 02:47.518
- He's a Ruxin.
- Yeah, and I'd be fine with

02:47.636 --> 02:49.220
that, except my firm
is sponsoring the team.

02:49.355 --> 02:51.439
- So what?
- So, they've appointed this

02:51.557 --> 02:53.940
douchebag partner named
Bethesda to run it, and so

02:53.941 --> 02:56.277
if Geoffrey doesn't do
well, Daddy doesn't do well.

02:56.395 --> 02:59.113
And if Daddy don't do well,
Mommy don't get a new car.

02:59.231 --> 03:01.316
And if Mommy don't get a new
car, Daddy don't get

03:01.483 --> 03:03.651
- his "D" dubbed.
- "D" dubbed?

03:03.819 --> 03:06.904
- Dick wet.
- Boo.

03:07.039 --> 03:08.823
[toilet flushes]

03:12.328 --> 03:15.630
Hmm. Cool.

03:15.748 --> 03:17.832
All right, well, the
season starts in ten days.

03:17.967 --> 03:19.834
We got to find somebody to replace Ted.

03:19.969 --> 03:21.836
Well, we could treat it like
your dating life and just ask

03:21.971 --> 03:23.838
ten random people and
see if anyone bites.

03:23.973 --> 03:25.840
<i>Oh, no, we don't need that,
'cause we need an eighth member,</i>

03:25.975 --> 03:27.842
not-above-the-pants
hand jobs. Fives?

03:27.977 --> 03:29.510
- Fives.
- Oh, fives.

03:29.645 --> 03:31.679
Okay, I'm sorry. Is
anybody else noticing these

03:31.847 --> 03:33.681
Andre slams are a little too clever?

03:33.849 --> 03:35.650
- What are you talking about?
- Uh, what am I talk ... ?

03:35.768 --> 03:37.602
Look, in my experience, no one
gets better at fantasy football,

03:37.736 --> 03:39.604
and in the off chance they do,
they certainly don't

03:39.738 --> 03:42.496
- get wittier talking about it.
- You trying to get at something here?

03:42.497 --> 03:44.737
Are you sure you're not
getting any outside help?

03:44.738 --> 03:47.695
Do I detect a sense of
jealousy? Don't worry.

03:47.863 --> 03:50.987
You'll be great once
again, but until then,

03:50.988 --> 03:54.252
I'll take the mantle.
Success in all endeavors.

03:56.538 --> 03:58.873
I don't know, guys.
Smell something rotten with

03:59.041 --> 04:00.875
Tefl-Andre, and it is not
just the Pitbull aftershave.

04:01.043 --> 04:03.878
Although, it is also
the Pitbull aftershave.

04:07.099 --> 04:09.217
Jay? Come in, Jay.
I think they're onto us, I thimk

04:09.385 --> 04:12.351
- they're figuring it out.
- Andre, calm down, buddy.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.917
You hang oith bunch of jag-offs. Trust
me, they haven't figured anything out.

04:15.952 --> 04:17.725
It's not like that group's
splitting atoms

04:17.892 --> 04:19.726
- anytime soon, man.
- That's a good one, Jay.

04:19.894 --> 04:21.812
- We should totally use that.
- What, are you worried I'm

04:21.947 --> 04:24.031
gonna run out of material, dude?
Trust me, I got you covered.

04:24.149 --> 04:27.053
- You got an easy group of targets.
- Jay, I owe you big-time.

04:27.054 --> 04:30.070
You know, if you're ever in Chicago,
you could totally crash at my place.

04:30.205 --> 04:35.075
- That'll actually never happen.
- Hello? Jay? Jay? Must be broken.

04:35.761 --> 04:37.920
So, we have any leads
on an eighth or what?

04:37.953 --> 04:40.201
- No.
- No. I asked The Oracle, but

04:40.335 --> 04:42.036
his dad just punched me in the dick.

04:42.170 --> 04:43.921
Why don't we just ask Autodraft?

04:44.039 --> 04:46.123
- He's always around anyway.
- He's already in another league.

04:46.258 --> 04:47.708
Yeah, figures.

04:47.843 --> 04:50.127
- We could try Rafi again.
- ALL: No!

04:50.262 --> 04:51.963
Oh, why don't we just ask Russell?

04:52.097 --> 04:53.965
- Huh.
- Russell?

04:54.099 --> 04:55.633
- Wait, the sex addict?
- Yeah.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.518
- It's not a bad idea.
- Look, we don't really have a

04:57.636 --> 05:00.888
- lot of options at this point.
- I don't know, guys.

05:01.023 --> 05:02.890
I mean, I'm flattered, but, no
offense, from what I've heard,

05:03.025 --> 05:05.192
your league is more of
a social thing, right?

05:05.310 --> 05:07.194
Less dependent on knowledge of the game.

05:07.312 --> 05:09.113
Yeah, yeah, it's just a bunch
of dumb-dumbs.

05:09.312 --> 05:11.215
No, no. You know what? We
don't even want a sex addict

05:11.383 --> 05:13.050
- in our league anyway.
- Excuse me. I'm not a sex

05:13.218 --> 05:15.052
addict anymore. I cured myself.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.605
- How?
- I got off of sex, and now I'm

05:17.723 --> 05:19.557
into wine. You can't
get addicted to wine.

05:19.725 --> 05:21.058
- Of course not. Good point.
- Well ...

05:21.226 --> 05:23.207
In fact, you guys got
to come check out this

05:23.208 --> 05:25.062
wine bar where I'm
working. It is super cool.

05:25.230 --> 05:27.862
Wine bar? I'm looking for a place.
Do they have lockers?

05:27.863 --> 05:29.632
- 'Cause I like to leave my ...
- All right, enough, Andre.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.568
Look, are you interested in this

05:30.736 --> 05:32.787
- league or not? Come on.
- I'm not sure it's a good idea

05:32.904 --> 05:36.490
for me to be in a shared fantasy
with a group of dudes where

05:36.625 --> 05:40.327
every single post on the message
board is about someone sticking

05:40.462 --> 05:42.997
something inside something
of someone else's.

05:43.131 --> 05:45.249
But what if it's, like, very
well written with historical

05:45.383 --> 05:48.753
references, science facts
and pop culture ideas?

05:48.887 --> 05:52.964
I'll think about it. By the way, is
there any kind of hazing ceremony?

05:52.965 --> 05:54.809
- Because that's a real turn-on for me.
- No.

05:54.926 --> 05:56.811
No, we'll drop it for this one.

05:56.928 --> 05:58.813
- See you guys.
- We got him.

05:58.930 --> 06:00.648
We got him on the ropes.
Kevin, your job is to get in

06:00.766 --> 06:02.316
- there and close this deal.
- No, no. Why me?

06:02.434 --> 06:03.984
- Why do I have to do it?
- You're the commissioner.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.653
And ask him if he wants
to be on the board of a

06:05.771 --> 06:07.822
successful corporation.
The EBDB could really use

06:07.939 --> 06:11.529
someone with his background of
having sex with a lot of strangers.

06:11.929 --> 06:16.030
All right, Baby G, we got baseball
today. Got your new batting gloves.

06:16.164 --> 06:17.884
No more books, okay?

06:17.885 --> 06:22.036
You got chocolate milk on
your ... Whoa!

06:22.170 --> 06:24.855
- That is not chocolate milk.
- [deep voice]: Get out of my room, Dad.

06:24.856 --> 06:29.677
What are you oiling your glove with?
Andro-Lube?

06:29.795 --> 06:32.630
Testosterone gel?
Geoffrey, are you juicing?

06:32.764 --> 06:34.799
- Get out.
- God, my son looks like an

06:34.966 --> 06:36.355
East German gymnast.

06:36.556 --> 06:40.064
Gentlemen, now, I know this
league is still short a man,

06:40.065 --> 06:44.809
but Taco Corp has finally decided
who its next board member's gonna be.

06:44.976 --> 06:50.648
- And that lucky person is ...
- No.

06:50.816 --> 06:53.701
- Not a chance.
- Pete, you're my first choice.

06:53.819 --> 06:56.919
I just saw you point at
Kevin, Jenny and Andre before me.

06:56.954 --> 06:59.707
If they said yes, I would
have said no. It was a test.

06:59.825 --> 07:01.709
- What do you say, Pete?
- What the hell?

07:01.827 --> 07:03.711
I will join Taco Corp as a board member.

07:03.829 --> 07:05.713
- Really?
- Welcome to Taco Corp.

07:05.831 --> 07:07.948
First things first.
There's a board meeting

07:07.949 --> 07:10.306
coming up. Please dress
nicer than you usually do.

07:10.307 --> 07:13.721
- And if you have drugs, bring them.
- Oh, hey, Kevin, what's up,

07:13.839 --> 07:15.723
you human shit statue?
Thanks to you, my son

07:15.841 --> 07:17.725
- has hit puberty.
- What?

07:17.843 --> 07:20.177
Yeah. My son's got a huge
bush now, like those ladies in

07:20.345 --> 07:22.263
those videos you search for on the Web.

07:22.397 --> 07:24.265
Don't look at me like
I'm the pervert, okay?

07:24.399 --> 07:26.150
You're the one getting off on
what I get off on, and I don't

07:26.268 --> 07:28.152
get off on that.
Look at my search history.

07:28.270 --> 07:30.354
'Cause you're not gonna find
little women with big bushes.

07:30.488 --> 07:32.523
- That's not what I'm into.
- I don't know what this has

07:32.691 --> 07:35.192
- to do with me, Ruxin.
- Because my son was oiling his

07:35.360 --> 07:38.662
mitt with Andro-Lube.
And who is it prescribed to?

07:38.780 --> 07:42.199
Kevin MacArthur.
"Keep out of reach of children.

07:42.334 --> 07:45.419
May cause puberty to begin."
So, if you'll excuse me, I'm

07:45.537 --> 07:47.838
gonna go home and wax my
son, you seedless watermelon.

07:47.956 --> 07:50.541
- Oh.
- What is Andro-Lube?

07:50.709 --> 07:53.043
- Are you juicing?
- No, I'm not juicing.

07:53.178 --> 07:55.379
- I have hypogonadism.
- You're allergic to walnuts?

07:55.547 --> 07:59.383
- No, I have low "T," low testosterone.
- Why would you not tell me that?

07:59.551 --> 08:01.385
Because I didn't want
you to think any less of me.

08:01.553 --> 08:03.053
Well, that's impossible. Fives.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.805
- Oh, my God.
- This is not a joke, Andre.

08:04.940 --> 08:08.809
I know. I'm upset, too. I mean, I lost
five dollars to Pete. I thought that

08:08.944 --> 08:10.811
- Jenny would dry up before you would.
- Oh, more fives.

08:10.946 --> 08:12.813
Can we stop with
this nonsense, please?

08:12.948 --> 08:14.815
This is a serious medical
condition I'm dealing with.

08:14.950 --> 08:16.817
Oh, come on, it's not a
serious medical condition.

08:16.952 --> 08:19.403
Yes, it is. I actually
think that part of my

08:19.571 --> 08:22.823
Sacko season last year was a
direct result of my low "T."

08:22.958 --> 08:24.825
Oh, yeah, 'cause you were playing
in a dead-ball era.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.296
- I had no "T" and I won the Shiva.
- Wow, this is a low point for the league.

08:29.414 --> 08:31.415
- We're tainted by drug use.
- Taco, you are constantly

08:31.583 --> 08:33.417
- taking drugs.
- Yeah, but those are

08:33.585 --> 08:36.386
performance-decreasing
drugs. Ho! Fives!

08:36.504 --> 08:39.306
- I got to give it up. They're good.
- That was pretty funny.

08:40.508 --> 08:42.426
All right, Big J. Be a hitter today!

08:42.594 --> 08:44.678
- Be a hitter now! Focus.
- Let's go, Baby Geoffrey!

08:44.813 --> 08:46.981
Baby Jeffrey?
Come on, Jeff! Big J!

08:47.098 --> 08:49.891
- Come on, fire him up.
- His-his name is Geoffrey with a "G."

08:49.926 --> 08:51.402
With a "G"? What is that?

08:51.519 --> 08:53.404
- What's your kid's name?
- Birth certificate says "Duke"

08:53.521 --> 08:57.358
but we call him Big Thunder.
Come on now, Geoff!

08:57.776 --> 09:00.945
Oh! Ow! Yeah!

09:01.079 --> 09:03.030
Way to go, Big G! Holy
cow, what have you been

09:03.164 --> 09:05.032
doing, extra batting
practice with this kid?

09:05.166 --> 09:07.034
Yeah, something like
that, something like that.

09:07.168 --> 09:09.036
This is good for everybody.
It's good for the team, it's

09:09.170 --> 09:11.038
good for you, it's good
for me. We're winning!

09:11.172 --> 09:14.008
All right, so I guess
I'm just gonna give ...

09:14.125 --> 09:16.961
- Geoffrey more batting practice.
- Hey, babe, thank you.

09:17.128 --> 09:20.214
- For what?
- You know, doing something

09:20.348 --> 09:22.800
- about your ... issue.
- My erections?

09:22.934 --> 09:24.969
- Yeah.
- You don't mind that I get

09:25.103 --> 09:27.304
- a little wind-aided erection?
- No, are you kidding me?

09:27.439 --> 09:29.890
I'm not the Olympics.
I don't mind an asterisk

09:30.025 --> 09:32.109
- next to my orgasm.
- I give you orgasms?

09:32.227 --> 09:34.361
- A couple over the years.
- Awesome.

09:34.479 --> 09:36.981
And I will take those orgasms
no questions asked, Barry Boner.

09:37.115 --> 09:39.450
- Stop it. Don't do that.
- Oh, I'm just kidding with

09:39.567 --> 09:41.652
you, Sammy So-hard.
[Kevin groans]

09:41.786 --> 09:45.823
Hey, Jenny, Jose Can't-sex-o, need to
borrow something real quick. [clicks tongue]

09:45.991 --> 09:47.825
See, when you do that, then
he starts to make fun of me and

09:47.993 --> 09:49.827
then the ball just keeps rolling.

09:49.995 --> 09:51.829
Thanks for the
Andro-Lube, No-Rod.

09:51.997 --> 09:53.831
And, by the way, when she's
coming, it's 'cause she's

09:53.999 --> 09:56.522
thinking about her ex Ben.
Have a good one!

09:57.602 --> 10:00.273
Still goes on my record.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.002
<i>Hey, Kevin. We're
actually closed right now. </i>

10:04.037 --> 10:05.689
- We're getting ready to open ...
- I know. I just ... I wanted to

10:05.807 --> 10:07.691
stop by to talk to you for
a second about the league.

10:07.809 --> 10:09.893
I know that you're considering
joining, and for whatever it's

10:10.028 --> 10:12.839
worth, I just want you
to know that these guys,

10:12.840 --> 10:15.532
they are the best.
I mean, I came in last place

10:15.650 --> 10:18.735
- last year, and I still love it.
- Well, I tell you, man, I'm

10:18.903 --> 10:20.621
thinking about it and
I'm leaning towards it.

10:20.738 --> 10:22.789
- Okay.
- But I'll be honest with you.

10:22.907 --> 10:26.043
- For me to relax and have fun ...
- Mm-hmm?

10:26.161 --> 10:27.995
... I really need to know that
there's a certain level of trust

10:28.129 --> 10:29.163
there. Do you know what I mean?

10:29.297 --> 10:30.664
- Oh, yeah, yeah, of course!
- Yeah.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.416
We are all trustworthy people.

10:32.550 --> 10:36.720
Here's what I'm gonna need:
I need to have sex with you.

10:37.088 --> 10:39.556
- W-What?
- I'm sorry. I'm in recovery.

10:39.674 --> 10:41.975
The word I'm supposed
to use is "lovemaking."

10:42.093 --> 10:43.844
I'm gonna have to have
lovemaking with you.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.929
- Uh ...
- We're gonna make love with

10:46.064 --> 10:48.982
our penises ... and our
balls, but mostly our penises.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.935
My-my penis ... I-I have
low "T," so ... eesh.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.770
- What am I gonna do?
- I'm all "T."

10:53.938 --> 11:00.158
I'm gonna make you a hot, steamin'
T"-pot of Earl Grey Russell "T."

11:00.193 --> 11:04.081
Uh, I'm-I'm not a fan of hot liquids.
[whooping, laughing]

11:04.199 --> 11:06.667
- You didn't say no!
- You were gonna do it.

11:06.784 --> 11:08.669
You were gonna have
a spot of Russell!

11:08.786 --> 11:10.254
Wait, wait. Was that not real?

11:10.371 --> 11:12.289
I just needed to know
how committed you were.

11:12.423 --> 11:15.125
He gets invited into the
league and I get initiated?

11:15.293 --> 11:17.127
- This is bullshit, Pete.
- Don't look at me.

11:17.295 --> 11:18.962
- This was Andre's brainchild.
- Yeah.

11:19.130 --> 11:20.964
It just came to me.
And here's another great idea.

11:21.132 --> 11:22.829
Since Russell has to
work on Sunday, let's

11:22.830 --> 11:24.683
watch the games here and
it'll all be on my tab.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.472
Everything but the, uh, Gruner
Veltliners. [Russell laughs]

11:28.640 --> 11:30.320
[Taco chuckling]

11:30.321 --> 11:34.361
Here we go, Geoffrey!
Make me and Hudabega proud, kiddo!

11:36.564 --> 11:38.365
[imitates explosion]

11:42.487 --> 11:45.205
This is actually a very sweet
father-son moment, just like ...

11:45.323 --> 11:47.157
eight years too early.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.712
That's right, that's the Jewish
genes in him ... Sandy Koufax,

11:51.829 --> 11:55.048
Shawn Green,
Geoffrey Lightning Ruxin!

11:55.166 --> 11:57.501
<i>[cheering]</i>

11:57.502 --> 11:58.669
Whoa.

11:58.803 --> 12:02.923
<i>Run, run, run!
[Ruxin laughing]</i>

12:03.057 --> 12:06.337
Roar, roar, roar, roar ...

12:06.338 --> 12:07.978
<i>Yeah!</i>

12:08.096 --> 12:10.147
- That's right!
- Yeah! [laughs]

12:10.265 --> 12:11.515
Hey, listen, man. I got
to tell you something.

12:11.683 --> 12:13.400
I was Sea-Dooing with
Hudabega this weekend,

12:13.518 --> 12:14.568
- up on Lake Michigan.
- Yeah?

12:14.686 --> 12:15.936
I told him all about Lightning.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.854
- He was jacked.
- Yeah!

12:18.022 --> 12:19.406
- Okay!
- Keep it up, all right?

12:19.524 --> 12:23.243
- Yeah-ah!
- They grow up so fast.

12:23.361 --> 12:25.195
Just got to make sure I have
enough Andro to get me

12:25.363 --> 12:27.447
- through the playoffs.
- Well, if you run out, I do

12:27.582 --> 12:29.449
have some replacement testosterone.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.585
- Really?
- Yeah, it's from a horse.

12:31.703 --> 12:33.754
It's more of a cream than a gel, really.

12:33.871 --> 12:36.262
- Enough. No.
- I have a ringtone of me making it.

12:36.263 --> 12:38.487
You want me to rub horse
jizz all over my son.

12:38.488 --> 12:41.878
- The medical term is "horse sploodge."
- Right.

12:42.046 --> 12:43.714
<i>ANDRE: Week one is this Sunday.
We're all gonna be watching</i>

12:43.881 --> 12:45.432
together. I need you
to just help me out,

12:45.550 --> 12:47.718
- just a little bit, all right?
- When you, uh, donated money

12:47.885 --> 12:49.553
to my charity Touchdown Dreams,
we said we were gonna

12:49.687 --> 12:50.887
- spend a day together?
- Yeah?

12:51.022 --> 12:52.272
I think this is a big much.
I think our time here is about done.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.891
- I still feel we have a couple more hours.
- This right here?

12:55.026 --> 12:56.727
Yeah, that's a winner.
That's your ideal lineup.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.695
- This is amazing.
- That's what I do.

12:58.813 --> 13:00.230
[Andre laughs]
All right, my time here is over.

13:00.365 --> 13:03.033
Uh, actually, Jay, I need
you just one more time.

13:03.151 --> 13:06.801
You feed me the lines, right into my
ear. And I won't need all your help.

13:06.802 --> 13:09.873
I mean, I got some pretty good
slams myself. I mean, I've been ...

13:09.991 --> 13:11.575
been writing them down since
I've been working with you.

13:11.743 --> 13:13.076
So you're writing down your ad-libs?

13:13.211 --> 13:15.629
We're watching the game and
someone's eating chicken,

13:15.747 --> 13:19.549
but they drop the chicken,
and I go, "Personal fowl!"

13:19.667 --> 13:21.218
- That is horrible.
- [Cockney accent]: "Hey there,

13:21.336 --> 13:23.287
guv'nor, what's the deal here?

13:23.288 --> 13:27.011
Uh, it's me, Jack the Ripper,
and I'm slicing up losers."

13:27.012 --> 13:30.761
- Did you honestly just use a Cockney accent?
- Yeah, 'cause Cockney's tough.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.846
You sound like a horrible
performance of Oliver.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.765
I was in a performance of Oliver.

13:34.932 --> 13:36.516
- I'm sure it tanked.
- Well, it didn't actually ever

13:36.651 --> 13:38.485
go out in the public
because I got the measles

13:38.486 --> 13:40.437
and I wasn't able to perform
it. Understudy did it.

13:40.605 --> 13:41.905
- That explains a lot.
- He was great.

13:42.023 --> 13:44.191
Hey, listen, listen, listen.
I'll help you, with one caveat.

13:44.325 --> 13:45.575
- Yeah.
- No Cockney.

13:45.693 --> 13:46.910
- [with accent]: Even a little?
- No.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.695
- Hey, Andre?
- Oh, shit! You got to hide.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.364
- I got to hide?
- He can't know that we're

13:50.498 --> 13:51.698
working together. Go, go, go!

13:51.833 --> 13:53.250
- You are killing mhitey.
- Go, go, go.

13:53.368 --> 13:56.703
<i>- Andre.
- Oh.</i>

13:56.838 --> 13:59.506
<i>- Andre.
- And ... send.</i>

13:59.624 --> 14:01.541
Oh, Pete. Uh, what are ...

14:01.676 --> 14:03.126
- what are you doing here?
- What's going on?

14:03.261 --> 14:06.213
- You got a girl in here or something?
- What? No. [laughing]

14:06.347 --> 14:07.931
Just kidding. I'm obviously joking.

14:08.049 --> 14:10.434
- Come on.
- But anyway ...

14:10.551 --> 14:11.968
- How you doing?
- Hi.

14:12.136 --> 14:13.637
I just want to say I'm very
happy for you, that you're

14:13.805 --> 14:15.792
coming into your own, uh,
as a man and as a fantasy

14:15.793 --> 14:17.474
football player. And I
really, really want to

14:17.608 --> 14:19.476
believe that that's what's
happening, despite all

14:19.610 --> 14:21.311
- evidence to the contrary.
- Yeah.

14:21.479 --> 14:25.031
That said, I take my role
in this league very seriously,

14:25.149 --> 14:29.953
- despite my carefree demeanor.
- What?

14:30.071 --> 14:33.657
What?
Should I discover that there are

14:33.791 --> 14:39.162
any, let's say ... shenanigans
going on, this will not

14:39.297 --> 14:42.165
<i>end well for you.
Capiche?</i>

14:42.333 --> 14:43.834
<i>- Capiche.
- Okay.</i>

14:43.968 --> 14:45.168
- Thank you.
- But you're clean, so it's good.

14:45.303 --> 14:50.640
Crystal. I mean, clear ...
clear ... I'm clean as a crystal.

14:50.758 --> 14:54.144
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Thanks, buddy.

14:54.262 --> 14:56.730
Thanks for ... hanging out.
That was a great hang.

14:56.848 --> 15:00.183
- Good.
- Hanging with Mr. Cooper.

15:00.318 --> 15:02.842
Oh, gosh. All right, you can
come out, you can come out.

15:02.843 --> 15:05.989
- That was close.
- Ooh, subterfuge! Intrigue!

15:06.107 --> 15:09.075
Honestly, that's, like, the
lamest spy movie of all time.

15:09.193 --> 15:11.411
- That was close, right?
- Who cares?

15:11.529 --> 15:12.863
- My time here is done.
- All right, almost.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.197
- Oh, fantastic.
- One second.

15:14.365 --> 15:15.699
- What?
- Before you go, uh, maybe we

15:15.833 --> 15:17.417
could grab lunch and
then swing by Barney's ...

15:17.535 --> 15:18.433
Where did you get the

15:18.434 --> 15:20.788
- idea that I ... like you?
- Okay.

15:21.171 --> 15:24.374
Okay! I'd like to introduce
Taco Corp's newest board member,

15:24.592 --> 15:28.094
Pete, no known last name.
Uh, Pete, say hi to your

15:28.212 --> 15:29.880
- fellow board members.
- Hi.

15:30.014 --> 15:32.215
This here's Slick. He's
in charge of HR, so if you

15:32.383 --> 15:35.218
have any sexual harassment
complaints, please see Slick.

15:35.386 --> 15:37.888
Unless, of course, Slick is the
offender, in which case you're

15:38.022 --> 15:41.433
gonna want to see Gupta over here,
who's in charge of accounting and

15:41.434 --> 15:44.695
he also supplies napkins and cutlery
from his brother's restaurant.

15:44.696 --> 15:47.898
Wow, you're a regular Warren
Buffett, Taco. [Taco chuckles]

15:48.065 --> 15:50.901
It's pronounced "Buff-ay."
Pete's gonna head the EBDB

15:51.068 --> 15:52.903
expansion. There are a lot of people out

15:53.070 --> 15:54.905
there having sex who don't know
who their Eskimo brothers are.

15:55.072 --> 15:56.907
Slick, you're writing
with the wrong end

15:57.074 --> 15:58.909
- of the pen there ...
- Don't tell Slick what to do.

15:59.076 --> 16:00.911
'Cause then he'll sexually
harass you and then you're

16:01.078 --> 16:02.913
gonna have to complain to Gupta
who's gonna send you

16:03.080 --> 16:05.749
- right back to Slick, so ...
- Got it.

16:07.218 --> 16:09.293
It's week one and we have
to watch football

16:09.297 --> 16:12.138
at a wine bar  with one TV?
How can I watch football

16:12.272 --> 16:14.474
- watching commercials?
- Nice!

16:14.608 --> 16:16.559
Baby Juicin' Geoffrey
Ruxin, another grand slam.

16:16.693 --> 16:18.561
- They are in the championships.
- Well, at least it's working

16:18.695 --> 16:20.563
- for someone.
- Well, it seems like Baby Geoffrey's

16:20.697 --> 16:22.565
hitting more home runs
than Kev over here, right?

16:22.699 --> 16:24.567
- Burn!
- Just keep following

16:24.701 --> 16:28.540
- the game plan, Andre.
- All right. This is a Pinot.

16:28.575 --> 16:31.040
And you will notice some serious
funk on this ... in a good way.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.377
Grape notes flashing across your
nose, subtle notes of leather as

16:34.495 --> 16:37.163
if you're maybe, like, biting
down on a leather gag, you know?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.298
- Oh, what?
- That kind of thing.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.918
- Okay.
- Now this, this is a Northern

16:42.052 --> 16:45.588
Californian Syrah.
Just velvety, rich, subtle

16:45.722 --> 16:48.925
notes, you know?
Maybe a feeling or a memory as

16:49.059 --> 16:52.145
if your hands are bound behind
your back with thick, thick

16:52.262 --> 16:55.264
rope, maybe your head is
being pressed down against

16:55.399 --> 16:58.184
a leathery car seat.
There's a little bit of shame,

16:58.352 --> 17:00.186
like maybe I did something
wrong, maybe I didn't.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.188
- [chuckles] I don't know.
- And you're getting that

17:02.356 --> 17:04.190
- from the wine?
- Absolutely.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.192
- Every wine has a story.
- Now, this Burgundy ...

17:06.359 --> 17:10.279
[slurps] ... just let
it run down the back

17:10.414 --> 17:13.165
of your throat.
For me, it's like an angry rugby

17:13.282 --> 17:16.618
team, you know, down in Mexico?
And the lights go out in the

17:16.752 --> 17:19.872
locker room and you feel someone
diddling with your holes,

17:20.040 --> 17:23.209
- but you're not upset.
- Russell, I'm not a wine guy.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.211
These descriptions are fairly explicit.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.547
The customers have
responded so positively.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.095
It makes wine more approachable.

17:29.096 --> 17:32.185
- Uh, no. You just made it slutty.
- If you want slutty, you got

17:32.302 --> 17:34.187
to try some of this
Brunello I'm gonna bring out.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.722
This Brunello?  It's like butt sex.

17:36.857 --> 17:38.724
- Ew!
- I'm excited, Russell.

17:38.859 --> 17:40.776
Oh, great. Another touchdown.
I'm gonna lose week

17:40.894 --> 17:43.446
- one to Andre.
- Oh, yeah! Look at that!

17:43.564 --> 17:48.031
Andre is one and oh ... yeah!
Ha-ha!

17:48.066 --> 17:50.703
This season started like last
season ended: with you being a loser!

17:51.021 --> 17:52.905
You know what, Kevin?
You know what you are?

17:53.023 --> 17:55.653
- You are ... You are ...
- What, Andre?

17:55.654 --> 17:56.909
Just-just say it, please, all right?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.161
Don't drag it out over
the course of the week.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.163
You know what? I'm
gonna take it easy on him.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.165
You've been on a roll,
man. Let him have it.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.833
Come on, Andre, drop
your load right here.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.535
- Do it!
- Now, let him have it!

18:06.670 --> 18:07.920
Let's hear the insults, come on.

18:08.038 --> 18:10.255
- [deep voice]: Finish him!
- [Cockney accent]: You better

18:10.373 --> 18:12.508
call the magistrate 'cause
Jack the Ripper's out ...

18:12.625 --> 18:15.878
- What?
- ... and he's cutting up losers ...

18:16.046 --> 18:18.681
[chuckles]
What are you doing?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.050
- So, you better get out.
- We can't hear you ...

18:21.217 --> 18:23.052
your Cockney's in your mouth.
Please, try that again.

18:23.219 --> 18:24.386
[laughter]
That was a good one.

18:24.554 --> 18:27.189
All right, anybody
need a refill over here?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.558
You know, Russell, thank
you for your friendship.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.560
It's been great to
get to know you better.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.562
I got to say, Andre, it's
been exactly what I needed.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.065
I know that when I'm hanging
around you, there no chance

18:36.199 --> 18:38.200
of me having sex with anyone.

18:38.501 --> 18:41.787
Andre, you cured sex addiction!
Congratulations! [laughter]

18:41.921 --> 18:43.789
Hey, hey,, what are we doing?!
What are we doing?!

18:43.923 --> 18:46.191
- It wasn't working.
- I told you ... tap out, abort!

18:46.225 --> 18:48.093
- Earpiece out!
- I thought I had it.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.851
- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing, Jay Glazer?

18:50.852 --> 18:52.097
I do a lot of charity work.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.099
- What?
- He's charity.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.850
- But without the write-off.
- Well, we'll just ... we'll

18:56.018 --> 18:57.569
- hang out a different time ...
- No, we won't, actually,

18:57.687 --> 18:59.571
we won't. Hey, I'm
giving him back to you

18:59.689 --> 19:01.239
guys, you guys are stuck with him.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.907
- Well, I'll text you.
- No, you won't.

19:03.025 --> 19:04.576
Don't Instagram me, don't text me ...

19:04.694 --> 19:06.244
- DM?
- Don't DM ... nope, nope, nope. Nothing!

19:06.362 --> 19:09.914
- All right, well, I'll hit you up on LinkedIn.
- No, you won't!

19:10.032 --> 19:12.334
- Okay.
- Andre, you outsourced your

19:12.451 --> 19:15.086
- team and your slam list?
- The only surprising part was

19:15.204 --> 19:17.872
he used Jay to keep a secret,
'cause usually it's

19:18.007 --> 19:21.399
- Andre that's Deep Throat.
- [laughs] The load all over the face.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.178
Oh, man. This league seems

19:23.312 --> 19:25.480
like so much fun. I'm
super psyched to be a part

19:25.598 --> 19:27.566
of it, guys. I just
found this Bordeaux blend

19:27.683 --> 19:30.068
down in the cellar. It's
like being locked in a

19:30.186 --> 19:32.654
bear's den who's been
hibernating all winter, and the

19:32.772 --> 19:36.525
bear wakes up and he's
hungry for one thing: pubes.

19:36.692 --> 19:37.636
Oh, that sounds good.

19:37.637 --> 19:39.734
<i>It's late in the game, man.
We're down by two.</i>

19:39.735 --> 19:40.829
We win the championship?

19:40.947 --> 19:43.075
- Yeah?
- Ooh, let me tell you something ...

19:43.110 --> 19:46.668
you're gonna be the hero of the office.
And we're gonna party like animals.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.622
- Me, you, Hudabega, Ski-Doos!
- Don't push it, all right?

19:50.756 --> 19:54.170
- Just make sure he gets a hit.
- Yeah. Okay.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.829
Well, order is restored.
Tefl-Andre is no more.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.499
- Thank goodness.
- You hit a home run, you get

20:00.633 --> 20:03.218
an ice cream sundae, Daddy's
in a new tax bracket, okay?

20:03.336 --> 20:05.254
I just think that gel is a
joke, it's a scam,

20:05.388 --> 20:07.472
- it doesn't work.
- Holy shit!

20:07.590 --> 20:09.474
He's a puberty monster!
What is this?

20:09.592 --> 20:11.476
He's like a six-year-old Tom Selleck.

20:11.594 --> 20:13.478
- Geoffrey, P.I.
- Puberty had to happen at some point.

20:13.596 --> 20:15.480
It's like LeBron James,

20:15.598 --> 20:17.816
- you know, just developed early.
- Batter up!

20:17.934 --> 20:20.185
All right, go get them.
All right, Lightning!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.745
Let's go strike!

20:23.849 --> 20:28.273
Here we go, Baby Geoffrey.
Here we go, Baby G.

20:29.382 --> 20:33.365
[crowd cheering]
[laughing]

20:33.499 --> 20:35.701
<i>Aw, man, that was a good shot.</i>

20:35.835 --> 20:38.086
<i>- Look at him go, man.
- Oh, God, look at his pits.</i>

20:38.204 --> 20:40.589
[Pete laughs]
His pits look like he's got

20:40.707 --> 20:44.676
Don King in a headlock.
[cheering continues]

20:44.794 --> 20:45.762
[pants rip]

20:45.763 --> 20:47.346
I ripped my pants.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.381
That's okay.
Ruxins are champions!

20:49.515 --> 20:52.050
Champions! Yeah!
[crowd gasps]

20:52.185 --> 20:55.304
- Are those ... ?
- Yeah. Giant, meaty clackers!

20:55.471 --> 20:59.475
<i>Damn! What the hell are
you feeding this kid, Dad?</i>

20:59.476 --> 21:02.708
Those aren't the normal sized
balls of a six-year-old boy.

21:02.709 --> 21:05.647
Geez, manscape this wildebeest!
This game is forfeited!

21:05.815 --> 21:07.649
Come on!
What are you talking about?!

21:07.817 --> 21:09.651
- You know ...
- Hey! Hey!

21:09.819 --> 21:12.489
You just screwed the office.
You know that?

21:12.524 --> 21:14.434
- No!
- Yeah, you just cost us the championship.

21:14.435 --> 21:17.659
- You and your son with his 19-year-old balls.
- We have meaty clackers!

21:17.827 --> 21:19.661
- They run in the family!
- Let me tell you something.

21:19.829 --> 21:21.663
This is you. [blows]
Yeah.

21:21.798 --> 21:23.131
- What?
- That's your whole career.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.334
No! No! I'm right here!
I'm right here!

21:25.501 --> 21:28.408
Uh-uh. You are shit.

21:29.438 --> 21:32.893
What about the Sea-Doo with Hudabega?

21:33.206 --> 21:34.994
Shit.

21:35.281 --> 21:39.025
