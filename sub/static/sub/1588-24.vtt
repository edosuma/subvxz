NARRATOR: <i>Things were slow,
</i> <i>real slow.</i>

00:29.197 --> 00:31.532
<i>But a good sleuth
</i> <i>always stays alert,</i>

00:31.598 --> 00:36.598
<i>on the lookout,
</i> <i>his eyes peeled.</i>

00:41.008 --> 00:46.008
<i>Yeah, it had been slow,
</i> <i>for a while.</i>

01:02.029 --> 01:04.698
<i>This would explain
</i> <i>why business had been so slow.</i>

01:04.765 --> 01:06.167
<i>Another detective agency</i>

01:06.234 --> 01:08.135
<i>had set up shop
</i> <i>right outside their door.</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:10.839
<i>And they were stealing
</i> <i>Tom and Jerry's clients.</i>

01:10.906 --> 01:15.906
<i>The cat and mouse detectives,
</i> <i>were ready to give Butch
</i> <i>a piece of their minds.</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:28.722
Let me guess.
You're missing a dish.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.823
Yeah, that's right.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.058
What's it look like?

01:31.125 --> 01:34.327
Well, it's blue,
shaped like, uh...

01:34.394 --> 01:36.830
Dish?

01:36.897 --> 01:39.297
This cat's good.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.655
(MACHINE WHIRRING UP)

01:50.811 --> 01:53.881
We'll need
a kibble sample and...

01:53.948 --> 01:55.898
A DNA sample.

01:59.554 --> 02:04.554
We'll analyze the data,
generate a hypotenuse
and have an answer in...

02:04.825 --> 02:06.593
36 hours.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.295
36 hours?

02:08.361 --> 02:11.665
What do I do until then?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.501
Eat out, I don't know.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.138
And payment in advance.

02:17.204 --> 02:22.004
All this technology
ain't cheap.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.886
Sorry.

NARRATOR: <i>Sure, he was slick
</i> <i>as a greased up bana

</i> <i>fast-talking gumshoe

02:59.013 --> 03:00.481
Madame Beta burgled!

03:00.548 --> 03:05.548
Fancy fish fleeced after her
treasure chest stolen.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.358
And aquatic A-Lister like her

03:10.424 --> 03:15.424
could use our high tech help,
at, uh, double our usual fee.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.937
Boys, boys.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.039
There's no need for violence.

03:25.106 --> 03:29.110
What say we settle
our little dispute
with a contest?

03:29.176 --> 03:32.312
We'll put our
state of the art technology

03:32.379 --> 03:34.648
up against your...

03:34.715 --> 03:36.117
You.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.953
The team that solves the case
is the winner.

03:39.019 --> 03:42.389
The loser
finds another line of work.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.206
Fair?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.864
My name is Madame Beta.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.468
And this is my butler.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.137
The front door
was never unlocked.

03:56.203 --> 03:59.072
We don't know
how the thief got in

03:59.139 --> 04:00.189
or out.

04:05.379 --> 04:10.029
The butler didn't do it,
mouse.

04:11.152 --> 04:15.802
Don't even think about it,
cat.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.493
It's all very upsetting.

04:18.559 --> 04:22.196
The theft happened while I was
summering at the beach.

04:22.263 --> 04:26.566

</i> <i>the main residence.</i>

04:26.633 --> 04:27.901

<i>my treasure chest was gone!</i>

04:31.438 --> 04:33.675

04:33.741 --> 04:37.511
That treasure chest
has been in the family

05:24.691 --> 05:27.841
Congratulations, pal.

05:37.572 --> 05:42.572
Next, we'll need
to analyze some data.

05:50.251 --> 05:52.886
Very interesting.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.321
And?

05:54.388 --> 05:58.425
And I should have the results
for you in...

05:58.491 --> 05:59.841
36 hours.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.735
They're very impressive.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.334
<i>More acorn shells?</i>

07:13.401 --> 07:14.802
<i>Maybe it was coincidence</i>

07:14.869 --> 07:19.006
