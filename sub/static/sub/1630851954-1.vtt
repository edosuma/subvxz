00:50.398 --> 00:52.661
<i>This is a story
that takes place</i>

00:52.835 --> 00:55.881
<i>on an island full of wonder.</i>

00:56.056 --> 01:00.147
<i>The story of two lost souls
searching for one another,</i>

01:00.321 --> 01:02.975
<i>although they
don't know that yet.</i>

01:03.150 --> 01:04.498
<i>Because, you see,</i>

01:04.673 --> 01:09.243
<i>no matter how alone
or out of place one feels,</i>

01:09.417 --> 01:12.072
<i>magic is all around us</i>

01:12.246 --> 01:14.770
<i>if you just know
where to look.</i>

02:05.777 --> 02:06.996
Easy, girl.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.304
Hey, Mama. Good girl.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
Come on. We're gonna
take good care of you.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.177
Come on.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.659
Let's go, gang.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.443
We're going
to the pound.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.456
Come on, girl, you're okay.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.371
Come on, girl.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.163
Hey, Food Stamp.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.078
New girl.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.478
The last tenant
put the unit on Airbnb.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.480
We don't play that
'cause we got rules.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.612
No subletting,
no water beds and no pets.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.571
- Y'all got that?
- Absolutely, Mr. Packard.

03:43.745 --> 03:44.789
We won't even drink water
in bed.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.051
Hey, 5-C!

03:47.183 --> 03:49.011
If your mama
wants her dishwasher repaired,

03:49.185 --> 03:50.447
tell her try a little grease.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.970
She'll know
what I'm talking about.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.234
O-Okay, Mr. Packard.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.847
Yes, I know it's important

03:59.021 --> 04:00.370
and I wouldn't ask unless...

04:00.544 --> 04:01.545
Hey, Mom.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.898
Yeah, okay, I understand.

04:07.072 --> 04:10.859
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.470
Packard wants a bribe
for the dishwasher.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.472
Splendid!
Just grab a stack of hundreds.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.082
I think they're over there
by the gold bars

04:17.257 --> 04:19.389
that Aunt Irene left us
in this rent-controlled flat.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.738
How was your day, sweetheart?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.394
Somewhere between
abysmal and atrocious.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.788
Those are
two beautiful words,

04:26.962 --> 04:28.180
which you probably
wouldn't use

04:28.355 --> 04:29.660
if you didn't go
to such a good school.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.358
Great! I'll have
an epic vocabulary to use

04:31.532 --> 04:32.794
in my upcoming decades
of therapy.

04:32.968 --> 04:37.451
Okay. It is hard
being the new kid at school.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.930
Those other girls
still bothering you?

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
It's mostly
just this one girl, Florence.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.631
- She calls me "Food Stamp."
- Why?

04:43.805 --> 04:46.155
Maybe because I'm on
scholarship, or I'm small,

04:46.329 --> 04:47.809
or because we just
moved here from upstate.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.551
- I don't know.
- Well, you're different

04:50.725 --> 04:52.335
to those other kids
at school.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.858
That's good.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.338
You know,
people who are unique,

04:55.512 --> 04:56.644
they're the ones
that change the world.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.081
Great!
I'll tell Florence that.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.822
Just let me call her mother.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.041
We can have them over here,
and we can all talk about it.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.869
My gosh,
were you ever a child?

05:05.043 --> 05:06.088
No.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.916
Um, but I was bullied, too.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.701
You know, you just have to
learn to stand up for yourself.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.268
Well, I guess I'm just
not as brave as you.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.226
I don't want to stand out.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.576
I'm gonna go change

05:15.750 --> 05:16.751
and then I'll collect
some more cans

05:16.925 --> 05:18.405
for the charity drive.

05:18.579 --> 05:21.277
Oh, did you talk to your boss
about the Chicago thing?

05:21.451 --> 05:22.757
Okay, so, apparently,

05:22.931 --> 05:24.715
the case has been
moved forward two weeks,

05:24.889 --> 05:26.674
and I'm the only
paralegal who...

05:26.848 --> 05:28.545
Mom!

05:28.719 --> 05:30.939
I am so sorry.
I'm just gonna be gone a couple of days.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.244
Really?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.463
Well, who's gonna
stay with me?

05:33.637 --> 05:35.073
I'll get a lovely sitter.
Yeah?

05:36.640 --> 05:37.859
Just not Uncle Casey.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.165
Are you kidding?
Uncle Casey?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.864
Who thinks that green M&M's
are vegetables?

05:43.038 --> 05:44.126
No, no, that is not an option.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.478
Mmm! Wh... Wh...

05:48.652 --> 05:49.653
Coming!

05:52.221 --> 05:53.744
Hey there.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.833
Sorry, I was just, uh,
grabbing a little power nap,

05:56.007 --> 05:57.226
Officer Jackson.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.706
What's this
you got going on in here?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.751
Oh, this is
just a temporary thing.

06:00.925 --> 06:01.926
I'm in between apartments.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.101
Hmm.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.364
Your meter's expired.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.061
Actually, no,
the meter is broken.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.758
Actually, no, it's working.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.152
It just had this bag
over the top of it.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.459
- Oh! Who put that there?
- Hmm.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.984
This city.
It is so disheartening.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.725
I'll get rid of that.
Do you want to give me that?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.683
Just to... Okay.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.598
No, I want to give you this.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.166
Can we do this later?
I am so late. Okay.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.342
Give it to someone else!
Pay it forward.

06:26.516 --> 06:29.040
Ooh.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.999
I'm okay. I'm so sorry.
I've got to go.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.001
So late.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.624
Ah! Burn. Burn.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.378
Hi.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.206
Casey Porter here
to see Mr. Harrington

07:48.380 --> 07:49.251
about the illustrator job.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.948
Hi. Yeah.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.125
That was at 3:30 and it's...
Mm, it's 4:15.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.866
Wow. Pretty sure
he said Mountain Time,

07:56.040 --> 07:56.911
so guess I'm early.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.260
No. Sorry.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.175
Okay, then,

08:00.349 --> 08:01.698
are these complimentary?

08:01.872 --> 08:03.439
Sadly, yes.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.746
Lunch.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.456
Idiot!

08:25.853 --> 08:27.637
- Hey!
- Hey, Malik.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.987
I'm collecting cans and bottles
for my school's fundraiser.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.120
- Do you have anything?
- It's Malik the Magnificent now.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.514
I'm going to magic school.
Hey, do you wanna see a trick?

08:34.688 --> 08:35.732
Sure.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.821
Okay, a deck of cards.

08:39.996 --> 08:41.650
Ooh.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.217
Fantastic.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.177
How about you,
Mrs. Crullerman?

08:46.351 --> 08:48.876
Do you have any cans for me?

08:49.050 --> 08:50.399
You can have this one,
<i>malyshka.</i>

08:50.573 --> 08:52.401
No, no! Moment.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.360
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.145
Here.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.321
Condensed milk?

08:59.495 --> 09:03.281
Magic school. Good luck.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.023
Hey. You know, when I get really good
at magic, you know what I'm gonna do?

09:06.197 --> 09:07.285
Make her disappear?

09:07.459 --> 09:08.983
No, I'm gonna cut her in half.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.376
Oh. Or that.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.297
- Hey, Mrs. Jarvis.
- Hi, Emily.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.691
- Do you have any more cans for me?
- I do.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.346
Does Packard know you're collecting
canisters in his edifice?

09:24.520 --> 09:26.522
He'll insist
on a retroactive commission.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.481
Not if we file a 501
<i>in loco parentis.</i>

09:29.656 --> 09:31.658
Then, she's protected.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.660
You guys must be good lawyers.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.184
Because I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.359
Hey, guys!

09:37.533 --> 09:39.883
Alonso!
Get the cans for Emily!

09:40.057 --> 09:41.102
Hey, you do it! I'm busy.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.712
- I'm doing the tofu!
- Eh!

09:42.886 --> 09:46.368
Emily, come check it out.
We got regular, seasoned...

09:46.542 --> 09:48.849
What's there to know?
It's the white stuff in the water.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.068
Here you go, Emily.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.983
<i>Mira, mira...</i>
Two years ago,

09:53.157 --> 09:55.943
genius here cuts his hand off
with a meat slicer.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.380
Now he's a tofu-eating vegan.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.338
It was a sign.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.388
Doggone it.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.737
Ah! Get out of here!

10:56.394 --> 10:57.613
There you are.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.094
Come on.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.880
Now, just because you're lost,

11:04.054 --> 11:07.144
it doesn't mean that you're
any less of a treasure.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.885
You understand?

11:09.059 --> 11:11.235
Oh, standing up for yourself,
are you?

11:12.497 --> 11:13.716
Yes, yes, I know.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.196
You're a dog.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.893
Ah!

11:17.067 --> 11:19.026
Hello.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.377
Now, let's introduce you
to all the others, shall we?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.077
Hope they don't mistake you
for a lobster.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.648
The whole block is bonkers.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.393
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.961
You know I said I was gonna get a sitter.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.136
Yo, yo, yo!

11:42.310 --> 11:43.267
What up, fam?

11:43.441 --> 11:44.660
You promised.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.359
- How's my favorite sister?
- Hey.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.798
And my favorite little niece?

11:51.972 --> 11:54.409
Money is gonna be
in this drawer here.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.107
And emergency numbers

11:58.108 --> 11:59.022
here.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.676
"911"?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.591
Give me some credit.

12:02.765 --> 12:06.377
Till the super fixes it,
please don't use the dishwasher.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.902
Emily has to be at school
by 7:45.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.905
In the morning?
What are they, farmers?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.429
Ooh, Mom won't be back
till Monday.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.474
So, what are we doing?

12:16.648 --> 12:19.608
"Get a little crew together?
Hit up the club?"

12:19.782 --> 12:21.001
Isn't that what you
young people say?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.177
We don't say that. Ever.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.222
- "Get lit?"
- Please stop.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.791
All set to go.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.793
Now, Casey,
I'm really counting on you.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.577
Are you sure
you can handle this?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.710
You're
bloody well right I can.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.582
You see,
if I hadn't moved here when I was two,

12:37.757 --> 12:39.454
I would've grown up
with a British accent also.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.239
Bollocks.
Rubbish. Collywobbles.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.241
Are you finished?

12:44.415 --> 12:45.634
Dumbledore.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.246
- I love you.
- Love you.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.032
Look, Mags, I got this, okay?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.468
Got the keys?

12:54.861 --> 12:57.820
- You've been here two minutes!
- I may have lost those.

12:57.994 --> 13:01.563
Um, okay, this is
my only other set.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.218
- Okay.
- Do not lose those.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.742
- I love you guys.
- Love you.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.483
Cheerio!

13:10.311 --> 13:11.703
Shocking.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.140
Ah.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.886
So, how's everything going in,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.583
I'm gonna say fourth grade?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.541
Sixth.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.934
Joking.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.544
Where's your sense of humor?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.678
I lost it. On the subway.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.898
I lost you one time.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.205
Okay, twice
if you count Atlantic City.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.120
But I won you back!

13:38.252 --> 13:40.820
Hey! I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

13:40.994 --> 13:43.039
We're gonna do something
super cool this weekend.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.433
Money is absolutely no object.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.131
As long as there's enough
of it in that drawer.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.354
How are there so many
people up at this hour?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.486
Hey, you want to get a coffee?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.619
I'm twelve. I'm not allowed
to drink coffee.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.795
- Red Bull?
- Really?

13:59.969 --> 14:01.841
Whew! Being a kid sucks.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.978
Oh, my gosh. Look,
there's an animal rescue tent!

14:09.152 --> 14:11.328
Can we go in? Please?

14:11.502 --> 14:14.418
My instinct is, "Sure",
so we probably shouldn't?

14:16.638 --> 14:18.770
But how could I say no
to that little face

14:18.945 --> 14:21.730
with those cheeks
and the, ah, missing tooth?

14:21.904 --> 14:23.340
I just want to dust you
in sugar...

14:23.514 --> 14:24.515
- Okay, okay, enough.
- Okay, okay.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.734
Come on!

14:35.787 --> 14:37.964
Wow. So beautiful.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.704
- Hi!
- Hi.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.663
Hi.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.144
Well, you're kind of creepy.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.885
Ah! Sorry!

14:52.369 --> 14:54.110
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.460
Hi.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.812
Oh, my goodness.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.817
Whoa! Uncle Casey,
there's a sloth!

15:05.992 --> 15:08.951
Oh. Hey.
My spirit animal.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.911
- Whoa.
- Don't touch that.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.391
Aw.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.615
Why would you put that there?

15:20.789 --> 15:23.183
- Shoo. Go away.
- Look at you!

15:23.357 --> 15:26.360
Splendid backpack!

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
- It matches.
- Cool.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.538
Well, you are obviously
a young lady

15:30.712 --> 15:32.670
- of immaculate taste.
- Thank you.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.630
Bridwell's the name,
and welcome to my

15:35.804 --> 15:38.459
Tentus Animalus Rescuus.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.462
Is that Latin
for "Animal Rescue Tent"?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.073
No, it's just regular words
with "us" on the end.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.857
Makes me sound smartus.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.686
So, what sort of animals
are you looking for?

15:48.860 --> 15:53.213
A temperamental tortoise?
A stand-up chameleon?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.824
Maybe something small,
cheap and stuffed?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.391
I want them all.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.959
Ah, yeah, we're not really
looking for a pet.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.570
Perfect! Follow me.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.747
The thing about animals is
that the best time to find them

16:05.921 --> 16:07.705
is when you're not looking
for them.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.273
Huh, does this tent
seem bigger on the inside?

16:10.447 --> 16:13.798
That's ridiculous!
It's smaller on the outside.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.238
Is that a baby giraffe?

16:18.412 --> 16:20.762
Or a long-necked hyena.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.678
I can't be sure
till I tell it a joke.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.594
Giraffes have
no sense of humor.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.031
Here we are.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.773
This is it.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.775
- There's no animals in here.
- That's right.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.690
You said you weren't
looking for a pet.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.083
And we're not.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.780
So you won't be interested
in him.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.129
Who?

16:54.578 --> 16:56.102
My goodness.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.800
You're just the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.584
Look at you.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.021
Aw.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.848
I got you.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.895
Oh, he's so cute.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.070
And... And so tiny.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.464
And so red.

17:11.638 --> 17:12.988
I love that he's red.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.339
How did he get that way?

17:17.513 --> 17:20.604
I don't know. I found him in
the park trying to be a pigeon.

17:20.778 --> 17:24.608
I think he's lost his family,
so he's a little confused.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.175
Poor guy.

17:26.348 --> 17:28.308
- I'll be your family.
- No, you will not.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.831
Please, Uncle Casey?

17:30.005 --> 17:31.920
He's so tiny,
he wouldn't bother anyone.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.835
Mr. Bridwell, how big
is he gonna get?

17:34.009 --> 17:37.186
- Well, that depends, doesn't it?
- On what?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.971
On how much you love him.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.888
Okay. Adorable. Put him back.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.934
Please, just look
at this little tiny face.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.676
I'm sorry. I'm new,
responsible Casey now,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.243
and letting you get a little

17:50.417 --> 17:52.723
radioactive micro-dog
is not responsible.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.464
So give him back.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.205
No, I'm not gonna
fall for that again.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.773
Give me the dog.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.602
Be careful.

18:04.909 --> 18:08.565
Well, thank you very much for giving me
the opportunity to crush my niece's dreams.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.351
I always wondered what it
felt like to be the bad guy.

18:11.525 --> 18:12.830
My pleasure.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.314
Oh, by the way,

18:18.488 --> 18:19.881
do you know what sound

18:20.055 --> 18:21.883
porcupines make
when they kiss?

18:23.102 --> 18:26.061
"Ouch!"

18:27.018 --> 18:29.369
Ah! Hyena.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.372
Okay, come on.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.201
Let's get you to school.
No word of this to anyone.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.342
OMG, did you bring
your garbage to school?

18:46.516 --> 18:49.040
No, this is the recycling.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.565
For the fund raiser?
Isn't that today?

18:51.739 --> 18:53.784
Yeah, but nobody
actually does it.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.569
The school just wants the money.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.919
- My mom wrote a check.
- Mine, too.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.442
Classic Food Stamp.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.232
Hey! Don't listen to her.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.712
She's just cranky because a
house fell on her wicked sister.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.107
I think it's awesome
you actually did the work.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.022
Really makes you stand out
around here.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.198
It was one of the last things
I was hoping to do,

19:16.372 --> 19:17.895
but thank you.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.941
- It's Owen, right?
- You know my name?

19:21.595 --> 19:23.249
Did I say that out loud?

19:23.423 --> 19:25.164
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

19:25.338 --> 19:26.469
I collected cans, too.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.602
Really? Where are they?

19:28.776 --> 19:32.345
My dad threw them away.
Said I looked like an Asian Oliver Twist.

19:32.519 --> 19:33.955
Oh, good job, Emily!

19:34.129 --> 19:35.696
Come on in, we're starting.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.190
Can we get a cleanup
on aisle four?

19:57.021 --> 20:00.111
Don't worry, Emily.
We'll get this cleaned up.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.033
<i>Another company
looking to make its mark</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:11.427
<i>through genetically-enhanced
agricultural products</i>

20:11.601 --> 20:15.126
<i>is Lyfegro

20:15.301 --> 20:16.780

20:16.954 --> 20:18.695

That's really nice to hear.</i>

20:18.869 --> 20:19.957
Hey, Em!

20:20.523 --> 20:22.046
How was your day?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.441
Good talk.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.058
<i>We are going
to reveal something</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:36.974
<i>that is going
to blow your mind.</i>

20:48.029 --> 20:49.073
Nothing?

21:01.085 --> 21:02.435
What?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.462
What the... Hey, it's you!

21:29.636 --> 21:31.420
How did you get in there?

21:31.594 --> 21:33.770
You were in my bag all day?

21:33.944 --> 21:36.599
They're gonna think
I stole you.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.122
Who put you in here?

21:39.907 --> 21:43.737
Oh, my gosh, you are just the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.307
Maybe you could stay
for a little while, right?

21:51.571 --> 21:54.225
Mr. Bridwell didn't tell me
your name.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.576
So maybe you don't have one.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.144
What about something cool
and old-fashioned?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.668
Like...

22:01.842 --> 22:03.800
Floyd!

22:03.974 --> 22:05.236
No? Okay.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.587
Um, Ebenezer!

22:07.761 --> 22:11.460
Sorry. Um, Ishmael.
It's from the Bible.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.854
No.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.247
Clifford.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.640
You like Clifford?

22:17.814 --> 22:20.295
Clifford it is.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.514
Perfect for you.

22:21.688 --> 22:24.734
Shh! No.
Uncle Casey will hear you.

22:28.782 --> 22:31.219
Clifford, where'd you go?
What...

22:34.353 --> 22:36.485
Hey, there's my retainer.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.708
You hungry, boy? Come on.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.536
Perfect.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.931
Clifford, no!

22:48.105 --> 22:50.369
Those are my brand-new
slippers. Clifford!

22:50.543 --> 22:52.153
Clifford, no, give it back.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.851
Really?

22:55.025 --> 22:57.027
I'm gonna call you Ebenezer
if you act like this.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.508
Come on, drop it.
Drop it, Clifford.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.118
Good boy.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.782
Clifford?

23:12.956 --> 23:15.002
Clifford! Where are you?

23:15.872 --> 23:17.221
Do you like turkey, Em?

23:36.371 --> 23:37.416
Hmm.

23:41.681 --> 23:42.769
Where'd you go?

23:46.686 --> 23:48.035
Oh, no.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.559
You.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.822
- You didn't.
- I didn't! I found him in my backpack.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.782
I specifically said no to the dog
and you completely ignored me.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.480
I swear, he just showed up.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.308
Oh, it just "showed up", huh?

24:00.482 --> 24:03.659
- What is that? What are you doing?
- Air quotes.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.880
It's a thing that grown-ups do when
they say something that they don't mean.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.360
Please, Uncle Casey,
can't he just stay for one night?

24:09.535 --> 24:11.232
No! Absolutely not.
I promised your mom.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.625
No, please.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.891
I'm not gonna fall
for your little girl powers.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.636
Oh! Okay, one night.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.725
And then, first thing
in the morning,

24:25.899 --> 24:28.510
he is going back to that weird old
man that we met in the animal tent.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.730
Mm, saying that out loud
makes us going in there

24:30.904 --> 24:32.514
seem like such
a poor choice.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.864
Why? I don't understand.
Why can't I just keep him?

24:35.038 --> 24:36.475
Because you can't have a dog!

24:38.477 --> 24:40.348
One night. That's it.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.784
Don't you...

25:15.818 --> 25:18.560
I wish we were big and strong,

25:18.734 --> 25:21.041
and the world
couldn't hurt us.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.575
Oh, my gosh.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.495
Clifford?

26:26.019 --> 26:28.238
Wait, wait. I'm going to wake up.
It's all in my head.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.806
I'm dreaming.
I'm going to wake up

26:30.980 --> 26:33.983
in three, two...

26:34.157 --> 26:36.856
Oh, my gosh, I'm not dreaming.
This is real.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.727
Clifford, it's really you.

26:38.901 --> 26:42.383
How did this happen?
How are you so huge?

26:42.557 --> 26:44.385
I mean, it's crazy,
but it's great.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.213
I did wish
for you to be big,

26:46.387 --> 26:48.084
but I didn't mean
big on the outside.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.346
I meant, like,

26:49.520 --> 26:51.000
mentally big.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.481
Clifford.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.442
What are you doing?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
No! My bed!

27:03.012 --> 27:05.188
Clifford, no,
that's my mom's pillow!

27:05.362 --> 27:06.537
Clifford, drop it.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.888
Come on, be a good boy
and drop it.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.063
Give it back!

27:18.071 --> 27:19.115
Ew!

27:22.205 --> 27:23.598
Bless you.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.948
Oh, no! My computer!

27:26.122 --> 27:28.734
Don't wag your tail. Sit, boy, sit.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.651
Clifford!

27:33.390 --> 27:34.914
Clifford, just

27:35.088 --> 27:36.611
be quiet, stay here, okay?

27:36.785 --> 27:40.006
Shh. I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh, shh, shh.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.666
Casey! Casey! Casey!

27:47.840 --> 27:49.668
- The meter's broken.
- Casey!

27:49.842 --> 27:52.932
It's 7:30. Huh!
We're gonna be late for school.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.934
- Casey.
- I'm up, I'm up, I'm up!

27:55.108 --> 27:56.500
Um, about the dog...

27:56.675 --> 27:58.502
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.157
And I don't want to be the no guy.
That's just not who I am.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.508
So if you really want to keep that weird
little thing, then it's fine with me.

28:04.683 --> 28:08.338
- So I can keep him?
- You just got to tell your mom I knew nothing about it, okay?

28:08.512 --> 28:11.298
You snuck it back here, you hid it from me.
I had no idea it was here.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.169
- I don't know if she's gonna believe that.
- She is.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.781
The thing is tiny.
It's completely plausible that I would...

28:20.786 --> 28:21.917
Run!

28:22.091 --> 28:23.919
Come on.
We got to get out of here!

28:24.093 --> 28:26.356
- There's a monster in the apartment!
- Casey, this is the dog...

28:26.530 --> 28:28.619
Uncles and children first!

28:30.056 --> 28:31.579
Stay back! Stay back.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.059
...from the tent.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.802
But last night it was...

28:36.976 --> 28:39.630
- Yeah, I think something happened to him.
- You think?

28:39.805 --> 28:41.720
He's the same dog
he was last night,

28:41.894 --> 28:42.851
he's just a little bit bigger.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.070
"A little bit bigger."

28:44.244 --> 28:46.202
It is the size
of a hippopotamus.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.857
Listen, he's not gonna hurt you, okay?
He's harmless.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.512
He's the same dog
he was last night.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.731
Stay.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.128
Oh, God. It's your mom.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.477
What am I gonna say?

29:00.651 --> 29:02.828
I don't know.
Uh. Just act natural.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.179
Act natural.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.834
Shoo. Stay still.

29:09.008 --> 29:11.358
What is happening?

29:13.752 --> 29:14.927
Okay.

29:15.101 --> 29:16.929
Remember. Natural.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.714
Hey, girl.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.021
- It's Maggie.
- I know, girl.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.023
Why do you keep
calling me "girl"?

29:24.197 --> 29:27.026
What? That's just a thing that
I say when I'm super chill.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.291
I just wanted to call to make sure
you were on the way to school.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.510
- We're walking to the subway now.
- Clifford, no!

29:33.684 --> 29:35.599
- Not gonna lose her this time.
- <i>That's not funny.</i>

29:35.774 --> 29:38.254
You're right, that incident is not
something we should joke about.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.430
- Clifford, no! Whoa!
- But we are being so safe right now.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.563
What is that noise?

29:42.737 --> 29:43.956
Nothing.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.522
But we're at our stop.
Uh, bye, girl!

29:45.696 --> 29:47.394
- Get up.
- Okay, bye.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.352
Okay. You, sit.

29:49.526 --> 29:50.701
No, don't say that!

29:54.314 --> 29:56.707
Somehow I thought
you'd be better in a crisis.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.233
We are finding
that Bridwell guy immediately.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.538
Why?

30:01.712 --> 30:03.323
So we can get rid of that.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.325
But you just said
I could keep him.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.153
Yeah, that was
before he 'roided up.

30:07.327 --> 30:08.719
Oh, come on.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.156
How is there nothing
on this guy?

30:10.330 --> 30:11.984
He doesn't even show up
on Google.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.247
"Bridwell's Animal Rescue"...
nothing!

30:14.421 --> 30:16.902
You can't give people pets that go
nuclear and then not be on the Internet.

30:17.076 --> 30:19.818
That is so irresponsible.
Even by my standards.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.645
Oh!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.952
- That means he likes you.
- Oh, great.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.565
- Who is it?
- Packard.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.830
Oh, no, it's our psycho super. We can't have
pets in the building... we'll get evicted!

30:32.004 --> 30:34.049
I'm here
to fix the dishwasher.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.268
- Coming in!
- One second!

30:35.442 --> 30:37.531
Not on my watch. Hide the dog.

30:37.705 --> 30:38.967
Hey, hey.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.276
I can handle this.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.191
Oh! Maybe I should do
my English accent.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.193
No!

30:47.367 --> 30:49.586
Hello.
You must be Mr. Packard.

30:50.674 --> 30:51.806
Who are you?

30:51.980 --> 30:52.938
Uh, Casey.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.765
Um, Maggie's sister. Brother.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.680
- Um, this is not a great time.
- It's now or never.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.030
Never?

31:00.902 --> 31:03.078
Well, what the heck
is going on in here?

31:03.252 --> 31:05.864
Oh, we were just doing
a little <i>feng shui.</i>

31:06.038 --> 31:08.388
It's Chinese
for "moving things."

31:09.476 --> 31:10.912
The dishwasher's right there.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.132
Yeah, but the water cutoff
is in the bedroom closet.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.785
- Don't... Don't go in here.
- No.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.048
Why not?

31:16.222 --> 31:18.746
- It's private.
- It's haunted.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.792
There's a lot of girl stuff in there
that I wouldn't want you to see.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.316
Yeah.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.927
- I can do it, though.
- Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Casey.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.581
Just get in there and give it
a little...

31:27.755 --> 31:30.062
- You know, he's family.
- Yeah.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.455
So, the, um...

31:33.369 --> 31:35.458
So, the dishwasher!

31:35.632 --> 31:38.897
So, it makes, like,
this weird crackling noise when it drains.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.292
Shh.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.079
No, no, no. Stop!

31:53.607 --> 31:56.044
Everything's under control!
Just shutting off the valve.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.612
Whoa!

31:59.613 --> 32:01.441
Must be these old pipes, huh?

32:01.615 --> 32:04.139
What the heck is going on
in there?

32:04.313 --> 32:07.099
So you are going
into my room now!

32:07.273 --> 32:09.101
Okay.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.105
I smell dog.

32:13.670 --> 32:14.584
Dog?

32:14.758 --> 32:16.195
No, um...

32:16.369 --> 32:19.938
That is just me.
I don't believe in deodorant.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.723
Why mask our natural essence?
In fact, we should smell each other.

32:22.897 --> 32:24.246
- Bring it in.
- Mmm, no. No!

32:24.420 --> 32:25.639
Okay.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.381
What are you doing?

32:52.187 --> 32:54.537
Yeah, I think I found
the problem.

32:55.756 --> 32:59.455
I got to order a part.
And I will have to return.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.892
Well, thank you very much
for coming.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.156
You are a super super.

33:07.594 --> 33:08.638
Ow.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.772
- Bye!
- Bye now!

33:11.946 --> 33:12.903
Thank you!

33:17.386 --> 33:19.998
This is the craziest thing
I have ever seen,

33:20.172 --> 33:21.956
and I've been to Burning Man.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.613
If we can't find Bridwell,
how are we gonna return him?

33:26.787 --> 33:28.615
Good boy, Clifford.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.705
Wait, return him?

33:31.879 --> 33:33.359
We can't abandon him.
We're all he's got.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.143
We just need to make him
small again.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.884
He needs to see a vet.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.278
- A vet?
- Yeah.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.844
We don't know
what's going on with him.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.803
What if he's really sick?

33:42.977 --> 33:45.371
What if he's still growing?

33:45.545 --> 33:47.982
What if he
grows to be a hundred feet tall?

33:52.595 --> 33:54.510
Okay. We'll take him to a vet.

33:54.684 --> 33:57.992
But after that, we are finding
Bridwell and we are giving him back...

33:58.166 --> 33:59.211
Whoa!

34:02.257 --> 34:04.085
...his giant dog.

34:06.957 --> 34:07.871
Come on.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.962
Nice job with the belts.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.443
Lucky your mom went through the
Madonna phase in the '80s, huh?

34:14.617 --> 34:16.010
Madonna?

34:16.184 --> 34:18.360
Uh, shouldn't we try
to hide him or something?

34:18.534 --> 34:21.668
Nah. It's New York.
No one'll even notice.

34:21.842 --> 34:25.933
No, no. I don't care if it's Johnny
Appleseed, don't touch my petunias.

34:29.545 --> 34:32.199
- You live here?
- Haven't you ever seen a mobile home before?

34:32.373 --> 34:34.202
Not like this one.

34:34.376 --> 34:37.292
My girlfriend and I broke up,
and what with my college loans, I...

34:37.466 --> 34:39.338
- Mmm-hmm.
- Look, this is a valid,

34:39.512 --> 34:41.034
financially responsible
life choice

34:41.208 --> 34:43.646
which your mother does not
need to know about. Okay?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.780
Oh, you're judging me as well.

34:47.694 --> 34:48.956
- In.
- Come on, boy.

34:51.871 --> 34:53.569
Just down the front here.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.442
No, oh! Or stick your big
fat butt right on my bed.

34:56.616 --> 34:57.573
No! Clifford.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.926
Clifford, don't slobber on his
financially responsible life choice.

35:05.668 --> 35:06.626
Emily!

35:06.800 --> 35:09.237
Owen. What are you doing here?

35:09.411 --> 35:12.327
I thought you were sick,
so I was gonna bring you your homework.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.894
And I also skipped P.E.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.765
Which I'm suddenly realizing
makes me look

35:15.939 --> 35:17.811
a lot more desperate
than I anticipated.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.553
- So you're not sick.
- No, we're going to the vet.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.555
Don't you need an animal
for that?

35:29.431 --> 35:30.476
Dogzilla!

35:30.650 --> 35:31.955
- No!
- Is that a dog?

35:32.130 --> 35:34.132
It's okay!

35:34.306 --> 35:36.786
Nothing to see here, folks, just a big
red puppy. Nothing to be afraid of.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.049
In.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.531
We're trying to keep this quiet until
we can get him small again. So...

35:42.705 --> 35:45.360
- Shh.
- This is so cool. You guys got to let me come.

35:45.534 --> 35:48.189
This is the kind of education
you can't get in a classroom.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.017
I've seen TED talks
about this.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.150
Sorry, pal. I got enough on my
plate keeping one kid alive.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.629
There is no way...

35:56.806 --> 35:58.591
Okay, I guess
he's coming with.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.378
Don't you dare.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.598
Clifford, no. No fetch.

36:05.772 --> 36:06.903
No fetch!

36:10.559 --> 36:11.604
Clifford!

36:11.778 --> 36:14.259
Huh? Oh, no. No, no, no!

36:14.433 --> 36:15.477
Bad doggy!

36:21.831 --> 36:24.182
- That's a good boy!
- Clifford, no!

36:25.661 --> 36:27.054
Bad dog.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.100
Oh!

36:35.932 --> 36:37.717
How has he
not popped that yet?

36:39.588 --> 36:41.634
Ah. There we are.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.332
Clifford, put him down.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.116
Drop the ball.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.468
- Drop the ball!
- Clifford, drop it.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.166
- Unbelievable.
- Good boy.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.647
No, bad boy. Very bad boy.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.562
He's cute.
Right over here.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.742
What is he doing?

37:02.916 --> 37:04.787
What is he doing?

37:04.961 --> 37:06.441
Uh-oh.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.316
- Awesome.
- Not awesome.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.709
Oh!

37:15.407 --> 37:17.670
Oh, I hope I'm not around
for number two.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.759
Yesterday's
TV interview

37:19.933 --> 37:21.413
- was brilliant, Mr. Tieran.
- Thank you.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.415
I mean, I don't want to have
high expectations,

37:23.589 --> 37:25.112
but I'm excited
about what I'm gonna see.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.507
Uh, well, unfortunately,
Mr. Tieran, we haven't seen

37:28.681 --> 37:30.683
exactly the kind of
genetically induced growth

37:30.857 --> 37:32.032
we were hoping for.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.645
That's a two-headed goat.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.300
We're trying to feed the world and
you're creating more mouths to feed?

37:39.474 --> 37:42.434
- I guess you could look at it that way.
- Oh, I am.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.525
And it's looking back at me
with four eyes.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.831
That's a little unsettling.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.137
What's our goal?

37:50.311 --> 37:52.444
- Well, to feed the world.
- Stop talking.

37:52.618 --> 37:57.187
Our goal is to grow giant food
through genetic engi...

38:02.758 --> 38:04.194
How much money have we spent?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.283
Is it...

38:05.457 --> 38:06.588
$400 million.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.112
- That is so much money, huh?
- I know!

38:09.287 --> 38:12.942
- Surely you have something to show for it. Right?
- Well...

38:13.116 --> 38:14.901
- So far, sir, not...
- I heard a "so far."

38:15.075 --> 38:17.251
- Did you hear "so far"?
- I heard "so far".

38:17.425 --> 38:21.386
And what that tells me
is we have not failed.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.127
We just have not succeeded
so far!

38:24.302 --> 38:26.347
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

38:26.521 --> 38:28.828
Not you.
I was talking to them.

38:29.002 --> 38:33.746
So with that $400 million,
what have we produced?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.705
Larger chickens,
cows that poop chocolate, what?

38:36.879 --> 38:40.274
- Why don't I just show you?
- Oh! That is what I like to hear, okay?

38:40.448 --> 38:43.364
Well, this sheep at least
has one head. That's a bonus.

38:43.538 --> 38:46.411
And what do we have here?
Thicker wool that shears itself?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.238
Fur that smells
like Santa Claus? What?

38:48.413 --> 38:49.892
Uh, not exactly.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.808
- We included her because she's m...
- Why, Albert?

38:52.982 --> 38:53.983
- She's m...
- She's what?

38:54.593 --> 38:55.594
She's...

38:56.421 --> 38:57.422
mean.

38:58.988 --> 38:59.946
She's mean?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.687
She's nasty.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.384
Well, now you're just
lying to me.

39:03.558 --> 39:06.953
- No.
- You're telling me that this gentle, sweet...

39:08.955 --> 39:10.609
Neat, huh? Kinda cool?

39:10.783 --> 39:12.045
That's not cool. Stop it!

39:13.612 --> 39:15.004
This is my childhood!

39:15.178 --> 39:16.179
Mr. Tieran?

39:16.832 --> 39:18.660
Colette. Yes.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.662
From the look on your face,

39:20.836 --> 39:22.838
I'm assuming you have
more good news.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.362
You need to see this.

39:24.536 --> 39:25.798
That can't be real.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.495
It's all over
the Internet.

39:27.669 --> 39:30.672
There's a ten-foot dog
in upper Manhattan.

39:30.846 --> 39:31.760
Oh, my...

39:31.934 --> 39:33.675
- I smell your hair.
- Sorry.

39:33.849 --> 39:37.287
Whatever made this dog
grow could make our food grow.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.202
And then save Lyfegro.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.729
Please find him. Yes!

40:02.008 --> 40:03.052
Is he all right?

40:03.226 --> 40:05.577
Eh, yeah, um, eh, well...

40:05.751 --> 40:07.666
He's, uh... um, well...

40:07.840 --> 40:09.319
Whoo!

40:09.494 --> 40:11.060
Are you gonna examine him?

40:11.234 --> 40:14.542
Yes. I am.
Because I'm a veterinarian!

40:14.716 --> 40:17.327
That's what I do,
I examine... animals.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.895
I'm gonna take a look inside your mouth, buddy.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.636
Oh, easy.
You want to maybe tell him?

40:21.810 --> 40:24.857
- Oh, yeah. Clifford.
- That's not gonna...

40:25.031 --> 40:26.424
Good boy.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.251
Oh, maybe have a little
more faith in the kiddies.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.514
Good job there, buddy.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.211
All right, let me take
a look there.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.346
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Yeah!

40:36.521 --> 40:38.958
Yes, they're large teeth
on a big red dog.

40:39.132 --> 40:43.049
Is that a medical opinion?
It sounded very scientific.

40:43.223 --> 40:45.878
All right, yeah, so,
why don't we get you on the scale, bud?

40:46.052 --> 40:47.183
But slowly!

40:47.357 --> 40:48.881
Oh!

40:49.055 --> 40:51.536
It's just the platinum edition
of the X-9000.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.363
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- No problem.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.887
I'm just gonna write...

40:56.889 --> 40:58.064
"heavy."

40:59.674 --> 41:01.110
All right.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.376
Yeah, why don't you
take his temperature?

41:06.551 --> 41:08.988
What? Why? I...

41:09.162 --> 41:10.859
- You know him a little better.
- Uh...

41:13.514 --> 41:15.124
- Where?
- You know.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.649
No, I don't "know"
because I'm not a vet.

41:17.823 --> 41:21.435
Well, in the animal
temperature-taking place?

41:21.609 --> 41:24.307
- Which is...
- Rhymes with "nut-hole."

41:31.314 --> 41:33.273
- No way.
- You don't wanna... Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

41:33.447 --> 41:35.057
Don't even worry
about that, Clifford.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.842
- Why don't I just listen to his heart?
- Yes!

41:37.016 --> 41:39.192
- That! Yes.
- Let's do that. Let's do that.

41:39.366 --> 41:42.587
I'm gonna listen to your heart
now, buddy.

41:42.761 --> 41:44.371
All right,
here we go.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.243
Oh.

41:47.417 --> 41:50.508
Yeah! Clifford, Clifford,
Clifford, Clifford...

41:51.944 --> 41:53.293
Oh, sorry.

41:53.467 --> 41:55.338
Well, I mean, I got to say,

41:55.513 --> 41:59.299
besides being big and red,
this dog is healthy as,

41:59.473 --> 42:02.694
- well, healthy as a horse.
- So you don't know what made him grow like this?

42:02.868 --> 42:03.782
I'm sorry, I don't.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.523
Live near a toxic waste dump?

42:05.697 --> 42:07.176
On top of a burial ground?

42:07.350 --> 42:08.743
- I saw this movie...
- Okay, I think we're done here.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.179
All right.

42:10.353 --> 42:12.791
Crazy idea: How about
we leave Clifford here

42:12.965 --> 42:14.270
with this professional

42:14.444 --> 42:16.838
until, I don't know,
your mom comes home?

42:17.012 --> 42:19.537
And if he hasn't shrunken back to a normal
size, then you can figure it out without me.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.190
- Casey!
- That is cold.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.499
Why don't I
finish up the examination?

42:25.673 --> 42:26.935
You guys can just go
wait in the other room.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.981
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

42:32.506 --> 42:34.813
All right, let's do
the easy part now

42:34.987 --> 42:36.858
and get you
out of here, Clifford.

42:37.032 --> 42:39.644
That's one big handsome fella
you got there.

42:39.818 --> 42:40.906
Why, thank you.

42:42.037 --> 42:43.082
Sign here.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.780
Very good, very good.

42:45.954 --> 42:47.782
Yeah, who wants a treat, huh?
You want a treat?

42:47.956 --> 42:49.218
There you go, buddy.

42:49.392 --> 42:51.873
Yeah. Good job. Okay.

42:52.047 --> 42:53.309
No, no,
you'll get another treat

42:53.483 --> 42:54.615
in a little while.

42:54.789 --> 42:56.835
Another treat
in a little while.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.924
You'll get it in a little...

43:02.667 --> 43:04.407
Thank you.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.800
You know, I've got to say,

43:05.974 --> 43:07.541
I've never seen a dog
that big before.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.282
He was tiny last night.

43:11.153 --> 43:13.286
Really?

43:13.460 --> 43:16.158
- You didn't happen to get him from Bridwell, did you?
- How'd you know?

43:16.332 --> 43:19.771
Sweetheart, I have been working in
this office for more than 20 years.

43:19.945 --> 43:22.643
Whenever anyone brings
a unique animal in,

43:22.817 --> 43:24.471
it always seems to come
from Bridwell.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.778
This one guy
couldn't speak a word

43:26.952 --> 43:29.041
until Bridwell gave him
a parakeet.

43:29.215 --> 43:32.522
That bird kept repeating
positive affirmations daily.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.176
Now the guy
can't stop talking!

43:34.350 --> 43:36.962
Another woman, she couldn't walk.

43:37.136 --> 43:38.441
She couldn't even move!

43:38.616 --> 43:40.313
Bridwell gave her
a spider monkey.

43:40.487 --> 43:41.575
- Every night...
- Lucille, help!

43:41.749 --> 43:43.055
...it massages
her feet,

43:43.229 --> 43:45.666
and since then,
she's taken up tap dancing.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.626
- Wow, this guy's like a wizard!
- Do you think he could make Clifford small again?

43:48.800 --> 43:50.932
Are you kidding?
That's nothing for a man like Bridwell.

43:51.106 --> 43:52.673
The guy
could perform miracles!

43:52.847 --> 43:54.675
- How do we find him?
- You don't.

43:54.849 --> 43:57.112
He's more of the
there-when-you-need-him type of guy.

43:57.286 --> 44:00.028
What do you do,
say his name three times and rub a lamp?

44:00.202 --> 44:01.508
So cute.

44:01.682 --> 44:03.641
Have you got any information
on your computer?

44:03.815 --> 44:05.947
- What kind of dumb question is that?
- Dumb question?

44:06.121 --> 44:07.645
He just suggested
rubbing a lamp.

44:07.819 --> 44:09.603
That's it!
I know how to find him.

44:09.777 --> 44:12.650
Bridwell was at our school yesterday.
He set up his tent there.

44:12.824 --> 44:15.653
So that must mean he had to fill
out paperwork with his info on it.

44:15.827 --> 44:18.394
- So the information is on the school's computer.
- Exactly!

44:21.093 --> 44:24.009
We hit the school fast,
get the info on Bridwell, and we bounce.

44:24.183 --> 44:25.314
I'll get Clifford
something to eat.

44:25.488 --> 44:26.925
Is it safe to leave
the keys up there?

44:27.099 --> 44:28.491
Who's gonna
want to steal this?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.276
Sometimes you pray
for a miracle

44:30.450 --> 44:31.843
to save your company
from ruin,

44:32.017 --> 44:34.584
and then you actually get it!

44:34.759 --> 44:36.412
But we don't
have him yet, sir.

44:36.586 --> 44:39.372
Oh, come on, it's hard to hide
a ten-foot red dog, Colette.

44:39.546 --> 44:41.287
And what is this?

44:41.461 --> 44:43.376
- It's an I.D. chip.
- It's an I.D. chip.

44:43.550 --> 44:46.422
And when this little guy finds its
way into our new large friend...

44:49.817 --> 44:52.559
...the dog becomes
Lyfegro's property.

44:52.733 --> 44:55.257
And red becomes
my new favorite color.

44:56.563 --> 44:57.564
Mr. Tieran.

44:57.738 --> 44:59.479
- What?
- Sir?

44:59.653 --> 45:01.002
- Yeah.
- Take a look at this.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.135
This girl appears with the dog

45:03.309 --> 45:06.573
- in 67% of the images that we've examined.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

45:06.747 --> 45:11.186
Now, I've traced the crest on her
uniform to an elite private school.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.971
Ugh! That's a litter
of terrible.

45:13.145 --> 45:16.365
- And...
- Oh. All right.

45:16.539 --> 45:20.456
"Emily Elizabeth Howard."

45:20.630 --> 45:21.675
Bingo!

45:26.288 --> 45:29.030
Hey,
that is a lovely broach!

45:29.204 --> 45:31.424
Could you break a 20?

45:31.598 --> 45:34.035
There's kids in the hall selling peanut
brittle, and I got a thing for P britty.

45:34.209 --> 45:36.821
- Peanuts? Ugh!
- Yeah.

45:36.995 --> 45:39.214
Just down the hall.
Far as you can go!

45:40.215 --> 45:41.651
She does not like peanuts.

45:45.743 --> 45:46.918
Nice job.

45:47.092 --> 45:49.747
I'll lift the intel...
stealth mode.

45:49.921 --> 45:51.574
They'll never even know
we were here.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.141
That would've sounded
so much cooler

45:53.315 --> 45:55.013
if you weren't holding
a SpongeBob flash drive.

45:55.187 --> 45:56.579
Shh.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.016
Working.

46:02.281 --> 46:04.326
Charming.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.504
Hello, good sir!

46:08.678 --> 46:10.376
How are you?

46:10.550 --> 46:13.422
I'm gonna guess that you're
either the superintendent

46:13.596 --> 46:17.470
or you're a part of the New York
Lantern Preservation Society.

46:17.644 --> 46:19.602
- What do you want, smart aleck?
- Okay.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.996
I need some information on one
of your tenants, please.

46:22.170 --> 46:25.304
Well, if you think I'm gonna
divulge some confidential infor...

46:25.478 --> 46:26.827
There we are.

46:27.001 --> 46:28.873
- What do you need to know?
- Yes.

46:29.047 --> 46:31.484
If you could just let me know
if you've seen these beings.

46:32.877 --> 46:35.749
I knew I smelled a dog.

46:45.150 --> 46:46.586
And one more, please.

46:49.154 --> 46:50.155
Thanks.

46:53.027 --> 46:53.941
Stay! Stay, stay!

46:54.115 --> 46:55.682
Dog!

46:58.293 --> 47:00.121
Oh! What the heck?

47:01.862 --> 47:03.733
Hey, Food Stamp.

47:03.908 --> 47:05.300
Thought you
weren't here today.

47:05.474 --> 47:06.780
Hi, Florence.

47:06.954 --> 47:08.826
Oh, you know, if you need
extra food for home,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.176
I'm sure we could organize
a food drive or something.

47:11.350 --> 47:12.830
I'm kind of in a rush.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.754
Do you know
how much this blouse cost?

47:24.929 --> 47:26.452
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

47:26.626 --> 47:28.889
You're an accident!
You shouldn't even be here.

47:29.063 --> 47:32.284
Why do you get to come here for
free when everybody else has to pay?

47:34.852 --> 47:35.853
Clifford!

47:36.766 --> 47:38.072
How'd you get in here?

47:38.246 --> 47:39.769
That's the dog
all over Instagram!

47:39.944 --> 47:41.423
Is that Emily's dog?

47:41.597 --> 47:43.643
Come on, let's go.

47:43.817 --> 47:45.950
Clifford, what?

47:46.124 --> 47:48.648
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?

47:48.822 --> 47:50.171
Can we pet him?

47:50.345 --> 47:51.477
Um, sure.

47:51.651 --> 47:53.783
This is my dog, Clifford.

47:53.958 --> 47:56.395
- How is he so big?
- He's so cute.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.092
I love him!

47:58.266 --> 48:00.529
Oh, this is perfect.

48:00.703 --> 48:02.183
The biggest nobody in school

48:02.357 --> 48:04.142
has the biggest freak
in the world.

48:04.316 --> 48:07.058
- I guess freaks of a feather...
- He's not a freak!

48:07.232 --> 48:09.669
What did you say to me?

48:13.238 --> 48:15.544
You're just mad 'cause he stole
all the attention from you.

48:15.718 --> 48:17.155
Whoa!

48:21.420 --> 48:23.074
Well,
that means he likes you.

48:25.119 --> 48:26.120
Burn!

48:32.648 --> 48:34.215
Okay, time to go.

48:34.389 --> 48:36.217
Yes, definitely time to go.

48:42.615 --> 48:45.183
Okay. We can't risk Packard
seeing Clifford.

48:45.357 --> 48:47.750
Owen, you stay in the truck.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.317
Wait a minute. What...

48:49.491 --> 48:52.668
Oh, and maybe get Clifford some water.
Thanks.

48:52.842 --> 48:54.627
Okay, we plug
into your laptop,

48:54.801 --> 48:57.456
download the info on Bridwell,
and then get out of here.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.154
Oh, my God.

49:00.328 --> 49:02.243
- No.
- We're evicted?

49:03.810 --> 49:05.203
This can't
be happening.

49:09.685 --> 49:11.383
Now I've really done it.

49:15.517 --> 49:18.607
This looks very complicated,
Mr. Jarvis!

49:18.781 --> 49:23.134
I'm not even sure if you're on the
right step for what I was reading you.

49:23.308 --> 49:25.919
Did you even read the legal
disclaimer on self-installation?

49:26.093 --> 49:28.661
Certainly, Mrs. Jarvis!
In what world would I ever...

49:30.750 --> 49:32.839
Somebody help! Somebody help him, please!

49:33.013 --> 49:34.972
Somebody help!

49:35.146 --> 49:36.582
Clifford!
What are you doing?

49:36.756 --> 49:38.758
- Priscilla!
- Jeron, please!

49:38.932 --> 49:41.413
- Somebody grab a ladder!
- Somebody!

49:41.587 --> 49:44.024
- Clifford!
- He's slipping!

49:44.198 --> 49:46.200
Jeron, please!

49:46.374 --> 49:47.723
Hold on, man!

49:48.986 --> 49:50.378
Help, please!

49:51.814 --> 49:52.902
Jeron!

49:59.387 --> 50:02.521
You just got fetched
by a big red dog!

50:04.827 --> 50:06.699
That was incredible!

50:08.527 --> 50:09.484
Thank you.

50:09.658 --> 50:11.660
Whose giant dog is this?

50:11.834 --> 50:14.359
It's Emily's!
It's Emily's dog.

50:14.533 --> 50:17.231
Emily! Your dog
just saved my life!

50:19.538 --> 50:20.669
Clifford?

50:22.106 --> 50:23.977
Hey, Emily,
did you see that?

50:24.151 --> 50:25.631
It was the greatest
Frisbee catch ever!

50:25.805 --> 50:28.025
Clifford, good boy. Good boy.

50:28.199 --> 50:29.765
Thank goodness.

50:29.939 --> 50:32.812
This is my dog, Clifford,
and that's my Uncle Casey.

50:33.987 --> 50:36.468
Wait, Packard
lets you have this dog?

50:36.642 --> 50:40.124
Um, not exactly.
But we're trying to figure it out.

50:40.298 --> 50:44.345
Oh, Owen, we couldn't get the computer.
We were completely locked out.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.652
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:46.826 --> 50:48.741
All right, I'll try
to figure something out.

50:48.915 --> 50:49.959
Thanks.

50:55.791 --> 50:57.228
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

50:57.402 --> 50:58.751
Can me and Emily
borrow your computer?

50:58.925 --> 51:00.100
Of course you may.

51:00.274 --> 51:01.493
Let me take
some action shots

51:01.667 --> 51:02.798
- as I'm walking with him.
- Yeah?

51:02.972 --> 51:04.713
It's not your fault.

51:04.887 --> 51:07.238
Oh, it is my specialty.

51:07.412 --> 51:10.197
Screwing stuff up
for your mom.

51:10.371 --> 51:12.852
I bet you didn't know your mom
got a scholarship to Oxford.

51:13.026 --> 51:15.115
- She did?
- Yeah.

51:16.203 --> 51:19.380
Wanted to go back to England
for college.

51:19.554 --> 51:22.514
And then our mom died,
Dad went to pieces.

51:23.471 --> 51:26.344
So she stayed here
to help raise me.

51:27.780 --> 51:30.304
She sacrificed everything.

51:30.478 --> 51:34.569
This is how I repay her:
"Surprise! You're homeless."

51:36.223 --> 51:38.878
That's why no one
ever believes in me, Em.

51:41.707 --> 51:43.143
Holy cow!

51:43.317 --> 51:44.884
Guys! I got into the file!

51:45.058 --> 51:47.191
I found a letter that Bridwell
sent to the school.

51:47.365 --> 51:50.324
But check this out: One of the days he
said he wasn't available is tomorrow.

51:50.498 --> 51:54.154
Because he's gonna be at St. Benedict's
Hospital for a prior appointment.

51:54.328 --> 51:56.243
- So we can find Bridwell tomorrow!
- Exactly.

51:56.417 --> 51:57.810
I'll be right back.

51:57.984 --> 51:59.507
<i>We've got eyes on her.</i>

51:59.681 --> 52:01.118
- Mrs. Jarvis!
- What? No.

52:01.292 --> 52:03.424
Have you not listened
to a word that I've said?

52:03.598 --> 52:06.645
- Emily, we're not playing this game anymore. This is over.
- No.

52:06.819 --> 52:09.474
We're calling Animal Control,
a zoo, a carnival, whatever.

52:09.648 --> 52:11.389
Oh! Hello!

52:11.563 --> 52:12.912
You must be Emily Elizabeth.

52:13.086 --> 52:14.348
Who are you?

52:14.522 --> 52:16.307
I'm Zac Tieran, from Lyfegro.

52:16.481 --> 52:19.092
It is so nice to meet you.

52:19.962 --> 52:21.355
Here's my card.

52:21.529 --> 52:23.662
You are a lifesaver,
young lady.

52:23.836 --> 52:25.707
I cannot thank you enough
for finding our dog.

52:25.881 --> 52:28.928
- Your dog?
- One of our clumsy janitors left the gate open

52:29.102 --> 52:31.278
and this large fella
slipped away from the lab,

52:31.452 --> 52:32.714
didn't ya, big guy?

52:32.888 --> 52:34.107
Okay.

52:34.281 --> 52:35.587
So,

52:35.761 --> 52:38.590
I'm sure he has been
a huge inconvenience,

52:38.764 --> 52:40.592
so if I may,

52:40.766 --> 52:43.116
I would like
to offer you this.

52:43.290 --> 52:45.118
I'm really coming around
to this guy.

52:45.292 --> 52:46.467
- Hold on.
- All right.

52:46.641 --> 52:48.861
Well, don't hold on. We...

52:49.949 --> 52:51.516
- Can I have a minute?
- Sure.

52:51.690 --> 52:54.171
- What are you doing?
- Ugh, I hate children.

52:59.306 --> 53:01.352
This fixes everything.
Clifford goes home,

53:01.526 --> 53:02.701
we bribe our way back
into the apartment,

53:02.875 --> 53:04.920
no one knows any of this
ever happened,

53:05.094 --> 53:08.881
and, well, I will take a very
small babysitting fee off the top.

53:09.055 --> 53:11.449
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

53:11.623 --> 53:12.972
You're lying.

53:13.146 --> 53:15.366
- Excuse me? What?
- Ah, that's a little strong.

53:15.540 --> 53:17.542
You said when Clifford escaped
he was big.

53:17.716 --> 53:19.500
I found him when he was small.

53:19.674 --> 53:20.719
Oh. That's weird.

53:20.893 --> 53:22.373
Everything okay, Emily?

53:22.547 --> 53:25.202
- Hold your roll.
- I was talking to Emily, my friend.

53:25.376 --> 53:27.856
- Everything's fine.
- Well, good. I'm Alonso with the Neighborhood Watch.

53:28.030 --> 53:30.729
- We're watching you! But we're not seeing much.
- Oh.

53:30.903 --> 53:33.427
I tried to be nice. Albert!

53:33.601 --> 53:34.994
Sorry.

53:35.168 --> 53:37.083
Thank you.

53:37.257 --> 53:38.171
Clifford, run!

53:38.345 --> 53:40.260
- No. No, no, no!
- Emily!

53:40.434 --> 53:41.609
Get him! Get him!

53:41.783 --> 53:43.307
We need backup,
now!

53:45.396 --> 53:47.136
- Clifford! Come here, boy!
- Come on!

53:47.311 --> 53:49.922
- Come, everybody!
- What do I pay you people for?

54:00.149 --> 54:01.629
In there! Go!

54:01.803 --> 54:04.023
- Oh, no.
- Get into the truck! Go!

54:04.197 --> 54:05.590
- Okay.
- Hurry, let's go!

54:07.200 --> 54:09.071
Clifford, come on,
we got to get to the truck!

54:09.246 --> 54:11.683
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

54:11.857 --> 54:13.119
Help me block the door.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.602
That'll hold them.

54:35.620 --> 54:37.317
Chips!

54:42.844 --> 54:44.672
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Alonso!

54:50.156 --> 54:52.158
Raul!

54:52.332 --> 54:53.942
Oh, my bad.

54:58.947 --> 55:00.253
There!

55:00.427 --> 55:02.037
What are you doing?

55:02.211 --> 55:04.213
- I'm getting Clifford out of here.
- You know how to drive?

55:04.388 --> 55:06.041
If Casey can do it,
how hard can it be?

55:06.215 --> 55:07.216
Oh, Lord.

55:10.132 --> 55:12.439
Try that stick thingamabobber.
My dad uses it sometimes.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.009
Whoa, whoa!

55:23.450 --> 55:24.582
Whoa!

55:24.756 --> 55:26.105
Okay, not "R".

55:26.279 --> 55:27.628
This is both unsafe
and illegal!

55:27.802 --> 55:29.021
That's two firsts for me.

55:32.894 --> 55:33.939
Oh.

55:34.113 --> 55:35.897
- Ow!
- Sorry.

55:46.995 --> 55:48.040
Whew.

55:54.046 --> 55:56.483
- I... I am sure we're fine.
- No, we're not fine.

55:56.657 --> 55:58.442
We're not fine!
We're not fine!

55:58.616 --> 56:01.096
Her mother is literally
gonna kill me.

56:01.270 --> 56:02.663
This truck
doesn't have airbags.

56:02.837 --> 56:04.970
Please keep that in mind
while we're crashing.

56:05.144 --> 56:06.972
Cops! Be cool.

56:09.191 --> 56:10.889
What are you doing?
Two hands on the wheel!

56:11.063 --> 56:12.107
Two hands! Even I know that!

56:12.281 --> 56:13.718
Two hands!

56:15.807 --> 56:18.592
- They're coming!
- Uh, take a left! Take a left!

56:20.638 --> 56:21.639
Whoa!

56:23.902 --> 56:25.033
That's my building up ahead!

56:25.207 --> 56:26.644
Garage is open.
Turn left right here!

56:26.818 --> 56:28.950
The garage is right there!
Turn now!

56:29.124 --> 56:30.212
Whoa!

56:37.132 --> 56:39.700
Okay. Let's never
do that again.

56:42.094 --> 56:43.835
You have
the toxicity reports, right?

56:44.009 --> 56:45.924
Yes, I do.

56:47.752 --> 56:49.493
It's Emily's school.
Just one...

56:49.667 --> 56:50.885
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's fine.

56:51.059 --> 56:52.321
Oh, hi, Mrs. McKinley.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.846
Hi, Maggie. I just wanted
to check on Emily,

56:55.020 --> 56:56.761
see how she's feeling

56:56.935 --> 56:59.067
- since she wasn't in school today.
- What?

57:01.461 --> 57:02.984
Oh, for the love of Mike!

57:03.158 --> 57:04.290
Siobhan, he's with us.

57:04.464 --> 57:06.161
Put the Swiffer down.

57:06.335 --> 57:08.729
Are you insane?
You're driving now?

57:08.903 --> 57:10.339
What are you upset about?

57:10.514 --> 57:12.341
I still can't get
my butt cheeks to unclench!

57:12.516 --> 57:14.605
Where are we?
Is this a museum?

57:14.779 --> 57:16.302
It's just a pied-à-terre.

57:16.476 --> 57:17.912
You live here?

57:18.086 --> 57:20.045
Yeah.

57:20.219 --> 57:21.873
Oh, geez.

57:23.788 --> 57:26.355
- Your turn.
- What? I don't know what to say!

57:26.530 --> 57:28.227
I'd go with anything
but the truth.

57:31.143 --> 57:32.449
Hey, girl!

57:32.623 --> 57:34.538
Emily, I just got a call
from the school,

57:34.712 --> 57:36.322
and they said
that you weren't there today.

57:36.496 --> 57:40.195
What? That's crazy talk, girl!
Of course I was at school.

57:40.369 --> 57:42.371
- Okay.
- You know what? Casey can explain.

57:43.372 --> 57:45.549
You're a better liar than me.

57:48.813 --> 57:51.816
Hey! There must have been
some confusion at the office.

57:51.990 --> 57:53.295
I heard they had
a peanut scare today.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.384
<i>But I will straighten
it out Monday.</i>

57:55.559 --> 57:57.082
No problemo.

57:58.213 --> 58:00.215
Brutus! No!

58:01.390 --> 58:02.914
- Is that a dog?
- A dog?

58:03.088 --> 58:06.047
What? No. No. No.

58:06.221 --> 58:07.135
It's the, uh,

58:07.309 --> 58:08.615
dishwasher.

58:09.311 --> 58:11.313
Just try kicking it.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.751
I think he wants
to smell Clifford's...

58:15.056 --> 58:16.188
you know.

58:17.711 --> 58:19.104
Okay. Hey, Brutus.

58:19.278 --> 58:21.236
Look, there. It stopped.

58:23.108 --> 58:24.152
You know...

58:27.982 --> 58:29.201
He done?

58:29.375 --> 58:30.985
Good boy.

58:31.159 --> 58:32.987
By the way, have you thought
about finding a new apartment?

58:33.161 --> 58:34.423
It might be time for a change.

58:36.948 --> 58:38.166
Uh, sorry.

58:39.254 --> 58:40.560
Just checked my phone battery.

58:40.734 --> 58:42.344
It's on, like, 1%
if you lose me.

58:44.912 --> 58:47.741
Whoa! Brutus!

58:48.960 --> 58:50.352
Well, you don't
see that every day.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.571
Brutus.

58:52.833 --> 58:56.184
He's okay. He's okay.

58:56.358 --> 58:58.099
Really?

58:58.273 --> 59:00.188
Maybe it's time to feed him.

59:00.362 --> 59:03.235
Okay, first of all,
thank you so much for seeing us, Captain.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.063
- Chief.
- Sure, of course.

59:05.237 --> 59:07.282
- You telling me this dog is yours?
- Absolutely.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.068
We were in the middle of an
experimental trial when it escaped.

59:10.242 --> 59:12.897
This creature
is a medical mutant.

59:13.071 --> 59:14.986
- Medical mutant?
- That's right.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.596
And I'm worried
that this mutation

59:16.770 --> 59:19.817
could potentially
jump species.

59:19.991 --> 59:20.905
Jump species?

59:21.079 --> 59:22.471
We need to capture this animal

59:22.646 --> 59:24.473
and return it to my lab
as soon as possible

59:24.648 --> 59:27.259
or the consequences
could be catastrophic.

59:27.433 --> 59:29.391
Picture this, okay?
You're going outside.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.089
- Cockroaches that size...
- Ugh!

59:31.263 --> 59:32.830
...flying around
the air! Okay?

59:33.004 --> 59:35.397
Rats that size walking around
the grocery store with you.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.660
Flying rats.

59:36.834 --> 59:38.183
- Flying rats!
- Fl...

59:38.357 --> 59:40.577
- Let me make a call.
- Great, make a call.

59:45.669 --> 59:47.975
He eats like an animal.

59:48.149 --> 59:50.064
Well, he is an animal.

59:50.238 --> 59:51.675
I'm talking about him.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.590
What?

59:56.288 --> 59:58.943
- <i>We take you to breaking news.</i>
- Hey, guys. Look!

59:59.117 --> 01:00:01.510
<i>I'm Chief Watkins,
New York City Police Department.</i>

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.556
<i>We are offering
a $25,000 reward</i>

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.732
<i>for any information
leading to the capture</i>

01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.734
<i>of the big red dog.</i>

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.736
- <i>The safety of the citizens...</i>
- And look who's there.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.608
<i>...of New York
is our primary concern.</i>

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:14.915
<i>We are currently working
in conjunction with Lyfegro.</i>

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:16.351
That is a very slappable face.

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.312
<i>Please, if you see something,
say something.</i>

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:21.792
- Owen! I'm home!
- <i>Any questions?</i>

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:23.271
Dad!

01:00:25.273 --> 01:00:26.274
Hey!

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.146
Who are you?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.670
Um, this is Casey
and that's Emily.

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:32.890
- Emily?
- Yeah.

01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:34.456
- As in the Emily?
- Dad!

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.720
Sorry.

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.635
He's never mentioned you.
Ever.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.725
Not once.

01:00:41.899 --> 01:00:44.510
So, can they spend the night?
They've got a problem.

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:45.903
What's the problem?

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.785
I withdraw the question.

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.831
Your dad
owns this place?

01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:02.746
Yeah, it's, um,
500 acres.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.965
A lot of space, tons of animals.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.751
- It's perfect for Clifford.
- And it's thousands of miles away.

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:09.317
Em,
the cops are after us.

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:14.279
Okay, bye.

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:16.194
Okay, so things are falling
into place.

01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.631
My shipping company has a
freighter docked in Newark.

01:01:18.805 --> 01:01:20.154
Leaves for Hong Kong
tomorrow night.

01:01:20.328 --> 01:01:22.243
Owen showed you our place
outside Shanghai.

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.289
It's fully staffed.
Clifford would be safe.

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:26.073
We're not gonna
send Clifford away.

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:27.901
- Emily.
- We're not doing that!

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:29.294
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:31.165
Would you mind
if I spoke with Emily alone?

01:01:31.339 --> 01:01:33.254
Of course. Come on, Owen,
I'll tuck you in.

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.126
Dad!

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.259
I never tuck him in. Ever.

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:40.218
Let's go, big man.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.002
- Good night.
- Bye, guys.

01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:44.439
We're having words
about that debacle.

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:48.139
Debacle?

01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:50.794
- China's not that far away.
- Really?

01:01:50.968 --> 01:01:53.971
Okay, that's a terrible lie.
It is very far away.

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:56.843
But this is definitely
what's best for him.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:57.931
I don't care.

01:01:58.105 --> 01:01:59.193
Clifford came to me

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:01.979
when I was alone
and had no friends.

01:02:02.153 --> 01:02:05.199
He's the best part of my life.
I'm not gonna abandon him.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:06.810
We don't have a choice.

01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:08.115
We've been evicted.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:09.595
And now,
according to the news,

01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:10.988
we're, like, actual fugitives.

01:02:11.162 --> 01:02:12.816
Bridwell could help us!

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.079
You heard Lucille at the vet's office.
He can do it!

01:02:15.253 --> 01:02:16.297
We just need to find him.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.082
- Emily...
- Casey,

01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:21.041
what if you found someone
who was so full of love

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:23.478
they made you feel
like you could do anything?

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:26.003
How would you feel
if you had to let that go?

01:02:30.616 --> 01:02:32.139
Okay.

01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:34.315
We'll go to the hospital,
look for Bridwell.

01:02:34.489 --> 01:02:37.666
But if we can't find him,
or he can't help,

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:40.408
Clifford's got to get
on that boat tomorrow night.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:45.152
Deal?

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:47.546
Deal.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.908
Looks like we're on the couch,
T-bone.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:10.830
Whoa. This place
is $27 mil on Zillow?

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:13.615
Hey, T-bone,

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.400
does Owen
have an older sister?

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:16.880
Okay.

01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:18.882
Just asking for a friend.
Understood.

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.580
Dude. Forget I asked.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.376
Okay.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.465
Owen, you stay with Clifford.
We'll go find Bridwell.

01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:38.989
Why do you always
leave me behind?

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:40.512
Because it's the
kind of education

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:41.818
you can't get
in a classroom.

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.429
Act natural.

01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.563
Clifford,
you sense things.

01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:50.827
You sense any chemistry
between me and Emily?

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:51.915
Because I sense...

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:56.354
Clifford, gross!

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:59.009
This is what killed
the dinosaurs!

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:00.445
There are rules!

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:02.839
You can't let one rip
in confined space!

01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:07.844
Okay, Clifford,
that was really uncool.

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.286
Clifford! Get in the truck.

01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:19.507
Are you looking for someone?

01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:21.640
Yeah.
Um, older guy, silver hair.

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:24.904
Tall. Kinda speaks in riddles.

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:28.342
That... That's his tie!
He wears a polka-dot bow tie.

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.344
- Oh.
- What?

01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:33.304
The man with that tie?
Your friend?

01:04:35.393 --> 01:04:36.698
He passed away this morning.

01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:39.223
No.

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:41.007
That's impossible.

01:04:41.181 --> 01:04:42.313
I'm sorry.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.365
He was so kind and magical.

01:04:51.539 --> 01:04:52.758
How could he die?

01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:57.502
If there's a memorial,
I could email or something.

01:04:57.676 --> 01:04:59.852
Yeah, thanks.

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:03.943
Uh, here you go.

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.684
What about Clifford?

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:08.426
I can't believe it.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.255
Bridwell was our only hope.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.480
I bet that's for us.

01:05:20.264 --> 01:05:22.005
It'll be fine. Come on.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.884
I just can't believe
that Bridwell is,

01:05:32.058 --> 01:05:33.538
you know.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.934
We can go back
to my apartment and hide.

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:40.719
Owen, the New York City
Police force is after us.

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.677
There's no more hiding.

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:45.637
If they find us, they're gonna
hand Clifford over to Tieran.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.422
So what do we do?

01:05:50.903 --> 01:05:52.209
- No.
- Em.

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:53.688
I'm not gonna give him up!

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:54.863
We've got to do
what's best for him.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.648
I'm what's best for him.

01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.651
Not if you can't
keep him safe.

01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.622
Call your father.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.282
All right,
everything's been arranged.

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:25.764
Colin will stay with Clifford from the tug to
the freighter, then all the way to Shanghai.

01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:27.418
He'll be met at the port
by my staff,

01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:28.985
and they'll bring
him to the house.

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:30.987
Come on, guys,
we got to get going!

01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:33.206
Mr. Yu, we can't
thank you enough.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.381
You're welcome.

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:38.429
Bye, Clifford.

01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:40.518
I hope to see you
again someday.

01:06:42.607 --> 01:06:44.174
Okay, go wait in the car.

01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:48.482
- I'm sorry it worked out like this, Emily.
- Thank you.

01:06:51.703 --> 01:06:53.052
Hey.

01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:57.839
I know you don't
understand, Clifford.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.538
It's just...
It's not safe for you here.

01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:03.193
You're just too big.

01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:06.892
And if they find you,
they'll do really bad things to you.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:08.633
I can't let that happen.

01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:13.986
There are no other dogs
like you.

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.511
And people, they just...

01:07:17.685 --> 01:07:20.079
They don't like things
that are different.

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:32.831
What's the matter?
What's he doing?

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:35.268
I think he's trying
to be small.

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:40.969
I'm sorry I let you down, Clifford.

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:44.103
I thought I could save you
and I couldn't.

01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:53.373
We have to be big and strong.

01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:55.723
Remember?

01:07:55.897 --> 01:07:57.769
So that the world
can't hurt us.

01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:03.557
You have to go
with these men now.

01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:06.952
It'll be okay.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:08.823
Hey, hey.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.696
Real proud of you.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.197
Bye, Clifford!

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:38.026
I love you with all my heart!

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:41.160
Be good for me, okay?

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.616
Apparently, the county
was sued in 1994.

01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:06.751
- Maggie! Is that Emily?
- What?

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:09.362
<i>...leading to the
capture of this Internet sensation.</i>

01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:12.017
- <i>The city-wide search continues in New York City...</i>
- What's the matter?

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:14.193
- <i>...for the big red dog.</i>
- That's my daughter.

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.586
<i>He was last seen in Harlem.</i>

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.761
- You go, yes.
- Yeah.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.810
Didn't get much sleep, huh?

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:25.899
Breakfast?

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:36.171
I know you don't drink coffee, but feels
like now might be the time to start.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.176
He's gonna
be happy there.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.483
You know who's not
gonna be happy?

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:46.660
My mom. Living in a van.

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:50.229
Nah, I think she'll
get used to the van life.

01:09:50.403 --> 01:09:52.752
Sleeping on the floor.
Peeing in a bucket.

01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:57.193
I woke up to some fun texts
from her this morning.

01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:58.368
Yeah.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.458
"Please call, right now."

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:04.112
All caps, exclamation,
angry face, angry face,

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:05.940
gun emoji.

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:07.899
Do you think she might be mad?

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:10.423
You want to finish
getting ready?

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:13.252
The maid comes around ten.

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:16.951
Ah, guy from the hospital sent
the info on Bridwell's memorial.

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.344
I don't want to see it.

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:20.041
Wait a sec.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.435
That does not look
like Bridwell.

01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:23.915
It's probably just him when
he was younger.

01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:25.133
Meh.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:28.920
That's not Bridwell.

01:10:29.094 --> 01:10:31.139
Not Bridwell.
Definitely not Bridwell.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:34.317
The patient in the hospital
must've got the wrong guy.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:36.232
So if that's not Bridwell,
that means...

01:10:36.406 --> 01:10:38.190
Bridwell's alive!

01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:40.453
This guy's dead, which is
tragic, but Bridwell's alive.

01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:41.672
- Bridwell is alive!
- Yeah!

01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:43.456
Feels weird high-fiving
the dead!

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.153
- There's still hope for Clifford!
- Let's focus on that.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.720
- Yes.
- R.I.P. Hamilton Wilder.

01:10:46.894 --> 01:10:49.027
- Long live Bridwell!
- Yes!

01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:50.985
- Guys!
- Owen, Bridwell's alive!

01:10:52.813 --> 01:10:54.685
Online... I researched...

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:57.340
I found... Bridwell...
the park.

01:10:57.514 --> 01:10:59.733
Okay. Again. With sentences.

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:02.649
Bridwell is alive,
and his tent is in Manhattan Bridge Park

01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.695
at the Freedom Festival.

01:11:04.869 --> 01:11:06.087
Emily!

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.176
Emily! Come quick!

01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:13.878
<i>The giant crimson dog was
stopped earlier this morning</i>

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:16.707
- <i>by the authorities on a freighter.</i>
- Can you believe this?

01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:19.884
- What?
- <i>No one is certain how or why he got aboard,</i>

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:21.625
<i>but it seems an effort
was being made</i>

01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:23.627
<i>to transport him
out of the country.</i>

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:25.193
<i>The enormous dog
is being returned</i>

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.239
<i>to his home at Lyfegro labs,</i>

01:11:27.413 --> 01:11:28.762
<i>the biotech firm
that created him.</i>

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:31.025
No! No, we have
to help Clifford.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.811
Uncle Casey, we have to save him.
They'll hurt him!

01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:39.730
Yeah. We do.

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:42.820
I guess we're paying Lyfegro
a visit.

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:44.778
I'm in. I'll go get the van.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.433
We're in.

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:51.785
Looks like Harlem wants
its big red dog back.

01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:58.966
- Guess who.
- Let me talk to her.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.187
- Hi, Mom!
- <i>Emily, what on earth is going on?</i>

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:05.146
- Clifford's in trouble.
- I'm in the taxi on the way from JFK.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.540
- There's no time to explain.
- Everybody, get in!

01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:09.803
- <i>I am an hour away...</i>
- Mom, I can handle this.

01:12:09.977 --> 01:12:12.415
- <i>Handle what? You're twelve years old.</i>
- I got this.

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:15.331
- And besides, Uncle Casey's with me.
- <i>And I am so sorry,</i>

01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.376
but, my darling, you... Emily?

01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:20.988
I'm grounded for life,
aren't I?

01:12:21.162 --> 01:12:22.599
You and me both.

01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:26.385
It's in Brooklyn Yards,
off Vanderbilt.

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:27.778
Okay, I'll meet you
over there.

01:12:27.952 --> 01:12:29.170
Hey!

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.737
Get out of my way.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:33.523
They should have left
that dog alone.

01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:35.568
Ooh. Now they're in trouble.

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:39.964
All right, let's start
sequencing its DNA.

01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:41.792
Yeah, okay, sir.

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:43.489
Hello! How are you?

01:12:43.663 --> 01:12:44.925
Who's a good boy?
It's okay.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.797
Good morning.

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:49.321
I got a speech, but what I have
to say comes from the heart,

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.410
and I apologize
if I get emotional.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:53.630
We here at Lyfegro,
we've got one mission.

01:12:53.804 --> 01:12:55.545
It's to feed the world.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.068
Hey, Mark, I like your tie.

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:01.072
We have an illustrious
team of scientists...

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:03.291
Okay.

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.381
Whoa! You carry bolt cutters?

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:06.730
Never leave the house
without 'em.

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.166
You live in a truck.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.254
Zip it, Owen.

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.516
And to prove that,

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:13.432
I'm sure you saw
that beautiful,

01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:16.348
magnificent creature
walking by, who...

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:18.959
playfully escaped
from our lab two days ago.

01:13:19.133 --> 01:13:20.526
And I tell ya,

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.529
we are very, very thankful
for that big red dog.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.838
Okay. Now we just need
a diversion.

01:13:28.012 --> 01:13:31.450
- We can handle that. Right, Mr. Jarvis?
- Yes, we can, Mrs. Jarvis.

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:33.496
We'll head around back.

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:35.323
We'll go make some
trouble at the press conference.

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.369
You have an opportunity

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:41.808
to make a sizeable return
on Lyfegro's investment.

01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:43.636
- Thank you so much.
- Uh, Mr. Tieran.

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.769
- Mr. Tieran!
- Yes.

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:48.815
Will you please address the lawsuit
that's being filed against you?

01:13:48.989 --> 01:13:49.947
Lawsuit? I don't...

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:56.083
It's locked. Don't worry.
I got a solution.

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:58.869
- We learned how to pick locks in magic class.
- I bet you did.

01:13:59.043 --> 01:14:02.176
We'll be filing a
class-action lawsuit against Mr. Tieran,

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:03.656
Lyfegro Research Facilities,

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:05.049
- and any and all...
- Guys, we've got bogies.

01:14:05.223 --> 01:14:07.268
Yeah, I don't speak legalese.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.228
We've already named Emily Elizabeth
Howard as head class representative,

01:14:10.402 --> 01:14:13.927
and we've attached an assault and battery
claim, inclusive of ethical violations.

01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:16.843
- Hey, let me go. Get your hands off her!
- This is unfortunate.

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:19.193
This is way too focused on me.
Look at that!

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.586
What is the matter with you?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.153
You're gonna set off
the fire alarm!

01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.241
There's another one. Just...

01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:27.637
- Security inside the building, what's going on?
- Go, go, go.

01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:30.727
- Check all the doors!
- Yes, sir! On it. Doing it now.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:41.564
What's going on?

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.352
Ah, look. It's a cute sheep.

01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:50.355
Look.

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.446
Holy sheep.

01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:58.102
- I'm out.
- Step aside. I know sheep.

01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:01.540
Come here, <i>mamachka.</i> Come to mama.
Yeah, come here, come here.

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:18.644
You see? Everybody likes
condensed milk.

01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:20.254
Go get it.

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:23.214
Yes, even the can tastes good,
doesn't it?

01:15:23.388 --> 01:15:25.216
Sectors three
through five clear.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:27.479
It's a false alarm
at the loading dock.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:28.654
Copy that.

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:30.177
False alarm
at the loading dock.

01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:32.179
<i>Resetting all systems.</i>

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:35.226
- Whoa!
- Clifford!

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.184
Sorry, my friends,
we're taking the dog.

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:39.796
I've got 30,000 volts
that says you're not.

01:15:42.799 --> 01:15:44.931
- I've got a plastic hand.
- But I have a real one.

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:49.719
No!

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:52.417
- Oh!
- It's heavy because it's condensed, <i>tovarishch.</i>

01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:53.940
Okay, anyone in a lab coat...

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:55.246
...take a hike.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.856
Okay.

01:15:58.118 --> 01:15:59.076
Huh.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.381
Clifford!

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.340
Are you okay?

01:16:02.514 --> 01:16:03.863
Clifford.

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:14.265
Clifford?

01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:16.572
Clifford!

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:18.312
You're okay!

01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:21.794
Clifford, buddy.

01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:23.187
I know, I know.

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.629
Aw!

01:16:30.803 --> 01:16:33.893
- Hey, buddy. I'm happy, too.
- I don't want to break this up

01:16:34.067 --> 01:16:36.330
because it is, like,
the most adorable thing

01:16:36.504 --> 01:16:39.856
I've ever seen, but how are we gonna get
him to Bridwell in Manhattan Bridge Park?

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:42.598
Listen, you guys take off without me.
Maybe I can distract security.

01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.774
I am a magician, after all.

01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:47.603
- What?
- We got to get him to the truck.

01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:49.953
Uh, no, no, no,
they'll grab him.

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:53.391
We're not taking the truck.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.832
- Hey, stop.
- Turn on the camera.

01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:01.442
Come on, jump!

01:17:02.008 --> 01:17:03.749
Whoa!

01:17:04.445 --> 01:17:07.100
Oh, come on! Get my car!

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:08.275
Let's go!

01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:15.718
Head to the park.
I'll meet you there.

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:17.197
We need backup, now!

01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:18.721
Go, Clifford!
Come on, boy!

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.163
Hey. What are you doing?

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:27.947
You like magic?

01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:29.688
- Watch me disappear!
- Hey! Get back!

01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.559
- We're here at Lyfegro...
- Can I borrow this?

01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:34.214
- Hey!
- That dog was stolen by Lyfegro.

01:17:37.435 --> 01:17:39.176
Oh, no! Look out!

01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.576
Come on! Go!

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:51.928
<i>It looks like the big red dog</i>

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:53.581
<i>has escaped
the Lyfegro facility</i>

01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:56.106
<i>in the strangest chase
I have ever seen.</i>

01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:00.893
Whoa! Easy!
Come on, come on! Yeah!

01:18:03.113 --> 01:18:04.941
I see red.

01:18:05.115 --> 01:18:06.203
Turn!

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:07.987
No, no, no, no, no!
Come on!

01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:09.772
Go, go!

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:11.295
He belongs to my niece, Emily.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:13.732
She rescued him
when he was just a tiny puppy.

01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:16.387
If her mom is watching,

01:18:16.561 --> 01:18:18.432
I'd like it on record
that I told her not to.

01:18:18.606 --> 01:18:20.608
- Casey?
- <i>But she didn't listen.</i>

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:22.567
<i>Because she knew,
right from the beginning,</i>

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:24.003
that that dog

01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:25.091
was her dog.

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:27.180
<i>And now, a big corporation</i>

01:18:27.354 --> 01:18:30.357
<i>is trying to steal a puppy
from a little girl.</i>

01:18:30.531 --> 01:18:32.229
Are we gonna do
anything about it?

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:35.972
And finally, to my ninth-grade
math teacher, Mr. Beamus,

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:38.452
who told me that I would
never amount to anything,

01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:39.845
<i>I would like to point out</i>

01:18:40.019 --> 01:18:42.369
<i>that only one of us
is on TV right now.</i>

01:18:42.543 --> 01:18:45.503
<i>So, Mr. Beamus,
you can kiss my...</i>

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.679
Oh, snap.

01:18:47.853 --> 01:18:48.985
<i>Sir, where is that dog going?</i>

01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:50.073
<i>Manhattan Bridge Park.</i>

01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:51.509
Can we go faster?

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.250
- Over here.
- I'm gonna need a ride.

01:18:53.424 --> 01:18:55.600
Look!
That dog right there!

01:18:55.774 --> 01:18:57.776
At the end of the tunnel,
the park should be really close.

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.909
- Just step on it.
- I'm stepping! I'm stepping!

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:02.389
- Guys! Emily! She's on TV!
- What?

01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:03.913
Careful!
Two hands on the wheel!

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:05.349
- Everybody calm down!
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:19:08.134 --> 01:19:09.483
Watch out!

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:13.357
Sarge,
big red dog heading north!

01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:21.017
- Yes!
- <i>We have police security vehicles</i>

01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.322
<i>all chasing after</i>

01:19:22.496 --> 01:19:25.586
a young girl riding
a giant red dog.

01:19:36.075 --> 01:19:38.991
They're back!
Come on, boy, faster!

01:19:39.165 --> 01:19:40.993
I mean, this is crazy!

01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:43.474
Doesn't she understand
she can't win? Come on.

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:53.310
Oh, no!

01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:55.834
Whoa!

01:19:58.532 --> 01:19:59.925
Come on, jump!

01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:01.492
Whoa!

01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:02.972
Hey, hey!

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:06.410
- Oh, perfect.
- Wow.

01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:13.330
- Yes! We made it!
- Look at that dog!

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:14.635
Look at the dog.

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:21.860
Mr. Bridwell!

01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.819
Mr. Bridwell!

01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:26.734
My goodness!

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:29.563
Someone's been eating
their spinach.

01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:31.827
You are hot! You need a drink.

01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:34.220
Go over there to that big blue
dunk tank over there.

01:20:34.394 --> 01:20:37.441
- Mr. Bridwell!
- Emily!

01:20:39.312 --> 01:20:41.488
We were looking for you,
and we thought you were dead.

01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:43.969
Well, I hope not.
I just booked a safari.

01:20:44.143 --> 01:20:46.232
But at the hospital,
we saw your bow tie.

01:20:46.406 --> 01:20:48.495
Oh, I understand.

01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.628
Well, I went there to spend
time with an old friend.

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:52.717
A very sick old friend.

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:55.111
And he'd always
loved that bow tie,

01:20:55.285 --> 01:20:56.939
so I gave it to him

01:20:57.113 --> 01:20:59.767
so that he could stand out
from the crowd up there.

01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:04.903
Mr. Bridwell, you have to make Clifford
small again or they're gonna hurt him.

01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:08.515
Small? But it was your love
that made him so big.

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:10.169
Nobody can take that away.

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:11.649
But will he be okay?

01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:13.912
Your love is all he needs.

01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:15.174
Create a perimeter!

01:21:15.348 --> 01:21:17.916
Do not let that dog
leave this park.

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.483
Emily
Elizabeth Howard,

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:20.701
for your own safety,

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.573
please step away
from the animal.

01:21:22.747 --> 01:21:24.531
- He's dangerous.
- He's just a puppy!

01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:27.447
That creature is the property
of Lyfegro

01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:28.971
and is a threat to our city!

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:31.190
No, he's not!
He never hurt anyone, I swear.

01:21:31.364 --> 01:21:32.539
Lock him in a cage.

01:21:32.713 --> 01:21:34.324
Whoa, you see that?
He's violent!

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:35.891
No, he's just scared.

01:21:36.065 --> 01:21:38.937
You would be, too.
Please, leave him alone.

01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:42.985
Mr. Bridwell,
you've got to do something.

01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:45.596
I can't do this on my own.
They're not listening!

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.338
Really?
Well, why have they come?

01:21:50.949 --> 01:21:52.733
Back off, back off.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.779
And you thought you didn't
have any friends, huh?

01:21:54.953 --> 01:21:58.261
All right, ladies
and gentlemen, disperse immediately.

01:21:58.435 --> 01:22:01.177
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:22:02.308 --> 01:22:04.745
See what happens
when people break the rules?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.704
Emily, if you want them
to listen,

01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:07.923
you'd better speak.

01:22:11.448 --> 01:22:12.666
Hmm?

01:22:13.798 --> 01:22:16.583
- Let's go get that dog.
- No, please, stop!

01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:20.413
No, I have something
I have to say.

01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:30.119
There's a lot
of people here.

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:32.382
You got this.

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:35.124
My name is Emily Elizabeth,

01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:37.430
and this is my dog, Clifford.

01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:39.911
I know he's bigger
than most dogs,

01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:41.957
but he's also the kindest,

01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.002
most loving dog
in the whole wide world.

01:22:44.176 --> 01:22:46.135
He's a freak!

01:22:46.309 --> 01:22:49.921
- It's dangerous!
- No, he's not dangerous! He's just different.

01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:51.314
That's all.

01:22:52.402 --> 01:22:53.751
I know how he feels,

01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:56.536
because I know
what it's like to not fit in.

01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:59.148
Just because you're different,

01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:02.020
it doesn't mean that it's okay
to be teased or bullied.

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:05.502
And I'm gonna guess that many
of you know how much that hurts.

01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:07.286
Emily Elizabeth!

01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:09.636
Someone once told me

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.203
it's the people
who are unique,

01:23:11.377 --> 01:23:13.945
they're the ones
who change the world.

01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:17.122
If Clifford was just a regular
dog, we wouldn't all be here.

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:19.516
We've got to stand up for him!

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:22.040
- Emily's right!
- Yeah, that's right!

01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:23.433
That dog saved my life!

01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:25.565
He doesn't hurt anyone.

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:27.785
He just...
He loves.

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:29.656
Yeah!

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:33.617
And if we can
love each other like this,

01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:37.229
none of us would have to feel
small and all alone again.

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:39.753
Right, Clifford?

01:23:39.927 --> 01:23:41.364
It's not right
to take him away

01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:43.061
just because he's big and red.

01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:46.021
So, please.
Please let me keep my dog.

01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:49.633
Who's with me?

01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:01.384
Oh! Oh!

01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:02.950
Bravo!

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:06.563
Bravo! Bravo!

01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:10.610
That was so inspiring, Emily.

01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.743
I've got chills.

01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:14.223
Oh, my goodness.

01:24:14.397 --> 01:24:16.268
Man, I hate to ruin
this beautiful moment,

01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:17.878
but I've got to reclaim
my property.

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.533
Because we all know this dog
you call Clifford

01:24:20.707 --> 01:24:22.579
- belongs to...
- Lyfegro.

01:24:22.753 --> 01:24:24.537
No, he doesn't.

01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:27.105
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Please do not take my word for it.

01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:30.630
You see, he was microchipped
at birth.

01:24:30.804 --> 01:24:32.545
Yeah.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:37.289
Officer, could you
please do the honors?

01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:39.683
- Go home!
- He converted her property!

01:24:39.857 --> 01:24:41.989
- It's in his left neck.
- That's right, left neck.

01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:43.687
Oh, my gosh, this is glorious.

01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:46.168
Excuse me, young lady.

01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:49.475
Isn't this fun?

01:24:58.005 --> 01:24:59.964
- This dog belongs to...
- Yeah.

01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:07.885
...Emily Elizabeth Howard.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.151
What? That's impossible.

01:25:16.154 --> 01:25:18.287
- Good for you, Emily!
- That's bonkers!

01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:21.768
This is a mistake. Nah-ah. It's a mistake!
It's got to be a mistake.

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:24.902
We need to have a talk about
the bill the city will be sending you.

01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:26.730
Please escort this gentleman
to my vehicle.

01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:28.123
Get your hands off me.

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:29.385
Come on.
Colette, where's my attorney?

01:25:30.212 --> 01:25:32.170
- I quit.
- What? Colette!

01:25:32.344 --> 01:25:33.476
I'll never leave you, sir.

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:34.738
I don't care about you.
Colette!

01:25:34.912 --> 01:25:35.826
- Ouch.
- Colette, come back here.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.221
Isn't technology amazing?

01:25:39.395 --> 01:25:41.048
People say
it's quite like magic.

01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:43.268
So, if you'll excuse me,

01:25:43.442 --> 01:25:45.140
I have some other people
I need to help.

01:25:45.314 --> 01:25:47.403
After all, you're not
the only person in the world

01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:50.188
who isn't looking for a pet.

01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:57.326
Officers!

01:25:58.196 --> 01:26:00.807
Stand down!

01:26:00.981 --> 01:26:02.548
Make way!

01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:04.550
- Come here, Clifford!
- Way to go!

01:26:05.899 --> 01:26:07.423
Come, come.

01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:09.033
- Hey, girl.
- Mom!

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:14.343
My bold and brave little girl.

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:15.822
Just like you taught me.

01:26:15.996 --> 01:26:17.955
Oh, by the way, Mom...
we got a dog.

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:20.044
Yeah, I noticed.

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:22.438
As for you,
I have no words to...

01:26:22.612 --> 01:26:23.613
"I love you. I forgive you.

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:25.005
You are
the responsible brother

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.833
that I always dreamed
of having."

01:26:27.007 --> 01:26:28.661
Okay, we'll go with that
for now.

01:26:30.054 --> 01:26:32.709
Well, you did it, Em.

01:26:32.883 --> 01:26:35.015
You saved him,
just like you said you would.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.888
Well, I couldn't have done it without
my mature and super-dependable uncle.

01:26:38.062 --> 01:26:39.933
You have another uncle?

01:26:40.107 --> 01:26:42.632
You know how you said
no one believes in you?

01:26:42.806 --> 01:26:43.981
I believe in you.

01:26:44.155 --> 01:26:46.201
You just need to believe
in yourself.

01:26:48.594 --> 01:26:51.467
- How do you know so much stuff for a fourth grader?
- Sixth.

01:26:51.641 --> 01:26:53.164
I was doing air quotes
behind your back.

01:26:54.034 --> 01:26:55.210
Okay.

01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:59.344
We love you, too, Clifford.

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:00.606
Guys!

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.086
Let's take a picture
of Clifford.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.392
A group photo.

01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.350
Everybody scooch in.
Get in, get in.

01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:08.440
Uh, Casey, you know what?
Casey, just get on the dog.

01:27:08.614 --> 01:27:11.095
- No. No!
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be neat.

01:27:11.269 --> 01:27:14.011
- Get on the dog, it's fun!
- I'm not getting on the dog.

01:27:14.185 --> 01:27:16.056
If you don't get on the dog,
I'll tell Mom about...

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.362
Okay, let's get on the dog.

01:27:19.146 --> 01:27:21.236
- There he goes.
- Yeah, get up there.

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:22.367
Come on, Casey.

01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:23.542
Get up there.

01:27:26.023 --> 01:27:27.633
There you go.

01:27:27.807 --> 01:27:30.245
All right.
That's perfect. Perfect.

01:27:30.419 --> 01:27:31.594
Oh, no.

01:27:33.204 --> 01:27:36.076
- Clifford. No fetch.
- Oh, no.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.035
- No fetch!
- No.

01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:42.082
Clifford!

01:27:56.662 --> 01:27:58.229
<i>And so the pure,</i>

01:27:58.403 --> 01:28:01.754
<i>simple love
between a girl and her dog</i>

01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:04.104
<i>changed everything.</i>

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.890
<i>Emily and her mother
were welcomed home,</i>

01:28:07.064 --> 01:28:12.635
<i>and Packard even acquired
a uniquely helpful assistant.</i>

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.811
<i>Other people matured.</i>

01:28:14.985 --> 01:28:18.423
<i>And by "other people",
I mean Uncle Casey,</i>

01:28:18.597 --> 01:28:20.947
<i>who finally
moved out of his van</i>

01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:23.254
<i>and got a proper job.</i>

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:28.085
<i>And so, a story that began
with two lost souls</i>

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:32.307
<i>ends with one big family:</i>

01:28:37.137 --> 01:28:40.619
<i>A little girl,
a giant red dog,</i>

01:28:40.793 --> 01:28:45.711
<i>and a city that came together
because of them.</i>
