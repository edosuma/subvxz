00:18.552 --> 00:20.686
No stress!

00:20.688 --> 00:23.155
We'll fix those street lights!

00:23.157 --> 00:27.926
Everything's gonna be ALL
WHITE! Nothing to fear.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.564
You all were a mess
before we got here.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.641
You go burn that lease and
please be civilized

00:42.643 --> 00:44.743
or else we'll have to
call the police.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.383
Could you believe this black
man had the nerve

00:51.385 --> 00:53.685
to walk a tad bit
too close to me?

00:53.687 --> 00:56.155
He looked just like one of
those rappers on TV.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.324
I got uncomfortable, went ahead
and dialed the authorities.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.341
It's okay to sell your soul.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.010
We'll revive your local bar,

01:18.012 --> 01:20.145
advertise it with a bullet hole.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.349
We'll buy your properties so low

01:24.351 --> 01:26.552
as you watch your
community cripple.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.087
Wait 'til you're gone, flip it,

01:28.089 --> 01:30.322
and then sell it for triple.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.396
Enough with culture, diversity,
artist, musician, actor.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.898
Where or however they
end up to me,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.533
it's just not a factor.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.969
But hey, no racists here.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.705
I voted for Obama,
all lives matter.

You all right, Nate?
Yeah.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.364
After what happened yesterday,
man, I'd have thought

02:45.366 --> 02:46.798
you'd have stayed
home today, bruh.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.767
Man, there's nothing to do
there but smoke weed.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.802
At least you can do it all you
want now,

02:50.804 --> 02:52.571
without listening to her
complain.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.807
I'm already as high as I'm
gonna get, dude.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.043
Figured I might as well come in
and cut some hair,

02:58.045 --> 02:58.944
make some money.

03:00.014 --> 03:05.083
Whoa, word on the street is,
there's a new bachelor

03:06.954 --> 03:09.288
on the loose my man.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.455
You told him?

03:11.458 --> 03:12.858
Nothing we didn't already know.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.194
Y'all were together
five years man,

03:15.196 --> 03:17.129
that was supposed to be wifey.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.569
You weren't even supposed to be
here today.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.072
Uh huh.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.574
Must feel good man, getting the
place back to yourself

03:28.576 --> 03:31.543
getting in the groove like a
player, hear me?

03:33.514 --> 03:36.648
No man, it's not even like that.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.518
I look around, it's fucking
ghost town in my house.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.589
All I see is nothing, I feel
these moments of our love

03:43.591 --> 03:46.358
everywhere. I touch shit, it's
just love emanating

03:46.360 --> 03:49.094
out of couches and cushions.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.930
Oh lord, you sound like a bitch
now.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.199
Yeah man, you call your mother
yet?

03:54.201 --> 03:56.335
Yo, I'm a man my dude, why you
gotta talk about my mom?

03:56.337 --> 03:58.237
No need to get swoll my dude.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.321
You know what and fuck you,

03:59.322 --> 04:00.404
because you're the one who put
all my business

04:00.407 --> 04:02.174
out in the street. And you know
what?

04:02.176 --> 04:03.508
You just sit there and you read

04:03.510 --> 04:05.377
your 50-year-old Ebony
magazines.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.012
We're all gonna work
in silence today.

04:07.014 --> 04:10.048
I don't know none of you
motherfuckers.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.783
Who he think he is? Shit!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.621
Yo brother, if you didn't want
to talk about it,

04:15.623 --> 04:18.190
you'd have kept your
silent ass home today.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.690
I'm not allowed to work?

04:19.692 --> 04:20.692
I can't make money?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.295
I'm just saying, bruh.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.267
Melissa left yesterday.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.002
We know.
We know.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.005
My brother...

04:34.942 --> 04:36.308
What happened?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.409
Nothing, what?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.044
You didn't tell them?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.112
Psh, I didn't tell them
everything.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.382
I wasn't there for everything.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.583
I was just there for
the beat down.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.084
She hit you?

04:46.086 --> 04:49.421
She did not hit me,
no, she didn't hit me.

04:49.423 --> 04:53.225
Why do you want her to stay if
she is hitting you?

04:53.227 --> 04:54.593
That's that gender equality.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.128
Stop it, no she didn't hit me.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.330
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

04:58.332 --> 05:02.401
Because it is classic
for abuse victims

05:02.403 --> 05:04.836
to deny everything.
That's true.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.905
You know what..? Mosey, come on.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.906
She didn't hit him.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.241
Thank you.
At least not

05:09.243 --> 05:13.412
when I was there.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.683
Okay.
I don't know what

05:17.685 --> 05:20.285
happened after that.
You know what?

05:20.287 --> 05:22.321
I am in pain, I lost somebody.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.089
It doesn't matter man,
she's not dead.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.140
You're just not hitting it

05:25.141 --> 05:26.190
from the back anymore, man,
that's all.

05:27.194 --> 05:31.697
A broken heart really needs a
little levity, okay?

05:31.699 --> 05:35.000
So why you got to be
such a sour puss?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.571
We all friends man,
now let's talk, talk it out.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.343
Now who sounds like the bitch?

05:44.345 --> 05:45.777
Yo, Chess, why don't you hit
him off

05:45.779 --> 05:48.280
with your liquid breakfast man,
loosen him up, man.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.381
Get his mind right.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.550
Shit, you don't smell
the weed on him?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.552
He's already high.
So all right then, Nate,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.887
What's good?
How'd it go down, bruh?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.365
Oh goodness.

06:07.968 --> 06:08.867
That was

06:13.307 --> 06:14.573
I'm gonna miss you,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.242
that was... I'm gonna miss you a
lot.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.279
I'm going to miss you, too.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.082
You still love me?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.652
I'm not doing this anymore,
Nate.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.889
We're moving on.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.458
I'm trying not to love you.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.263
Yeah, your logic is tight.

06:38.265 --> 06:42.167
But, yes.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.470
If that's what you're wondering.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.842
Yeah, kinda. Yeah, I mean I
know I wasn't the only one

06:50.844 --> 06:52.944
that felt something just now
when we were,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.647
you know, bonin'.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.755
That extra minute was special
because I didn't get you

07:03.757 --> 07:05.757
an anniversary gift
two weeks ago.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.365
You know what I was
thinking

07:13.367 --> 07:14.866
while you were in the shower?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.471
What?

07:19.473 --> 07:21.039
I was thinking that maybe this
isn't really happening.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.774
It's happening.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.576
My mother always said it's
better to break up

07:24.578 --> 07:26.111
while you still love someone.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.446
Breaking up while you hate
someone

07:27.448 --> 07:29.448
usually ends in murder.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.449
Yeah, but that's my point,

07:30.451 --> 07:31.883
we don't hate each other, right?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.819
We love each other, we said it
a bunch of times

07:33.821 --> 07:34.986
in that flurry of passion.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.289
That flurry of passion was a
goodbye fuck.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.759
It was?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.527
You were the one who said 'How
about a goodbye fuck?'

07:44.398 --> 07:45.297
That's right.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.799
I obliged.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.736
Can't believe I did that.

07:51.738 --> 07:55.006
I knew you'd twist everything
the second it was over.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.726
What?

07:57.727 --> 07:58.476
I'm not twisting anything! I
just think

07:58.479 --> 08:01.079
we don't have to break up
because we had great sex.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.418
For us, great sex, we were in
there crying

08:06.420 --> 08:08.587
it was all emotional, I mean,
doesn't that mean anything?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.188
Does it?

08:10.190 --> 08:13.425
You want to know what I was
thinking about in the shower?

08:13.427 --> 08:14.359
Maybe.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.194
I was wondering how
long will it take

08:16.196 --> 08:18.697
to wash your smell off of me,

08:18.699 --> 08:19.998
because I don't want to smell
you tonight

08:20.000 --> 08:23.201
when I go to sleep in my new
home and you know what?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.239
I can still smell you. Fuck!

08:30.377 --> 08:32.844
Let's just forget this morning
ever happened.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.948
No, I don't want to forget what
happened this morning.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.885
I do, think about something
else.

08:39.886 --> 08:40.818
Don't you have school work?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.287
It'll get done.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.856
I bet if you had your study
partner you'd be more focused.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.224
See, you want me to leave you
alone,

08:46.226 --> 08:48.326
but you keep bringing up
bullshit.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.394
Fine.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.036
And another thing, I want my
teapot back.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.705
You mean the teapot
you bought me?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.241
I bought it for the apartment.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.809
When I moved in you
heated your water

09:04.811 --> 09:06.578
in the microwave, like a
heathen.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.346
What are you talking about,
"heathen"?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.748
That shit is technology.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.117
It's mine, I'm taking it.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.453
So you don't want tea, then?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.331
Yes?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.599
Yes.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.403
I don't want to talk about it,
just get over here now.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.573
I don't give a shit about
Alternate Side,

09:34.575 --> 09:36.007
I'll pay for the ticket.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.349
Here you go and don't forget
you got

09:44.351 --> 09:45.784
the sneakers by the door.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.687
Yeah, I know.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.722
Oh, and I'm gonna need your
address for the mail.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.623
No you won't.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.910
Don't you care about your mail?

09:54.911 --> 09:56.695
Why do you think I found in
apartment in secret?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.701
I'm already getting my mail
there, thanks.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.936
Yeah, but you know sometimes...

10:04.938 --> 10:06.938
You know what, anything that
slips through the mail Nate

10:06.940 --> 10:08.640
you can have, go crazy.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.444
Okay, you know what?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.445
I was just trying to be nice.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.081
You want this to be nice?
Nicer than this.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.482
I have nothing to be nice about.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.517
You have nothing to be a bitch
about.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.120
Fuck you.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.421
You already did that today

10:23.423 --> 10:24.255
and that still didn't
chill you out.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.558
You're a fucking waste.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.060
You know what?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.561
Your heart wouldn't be breaking
over a fucking waste, babe.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.163
You cheated on me, that's why
I'm a bitch.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.598
You want a bitch,
you got a bitch,

10:33.600 --> 10:34.733
you ungrateful motherfucker.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.134
Not ungrateful, listen I know
that you helped me

10:36.136 --> 10:37.836
get a lot of shit straight in
my life.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.104
Damn right, I did.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.506
Okay, I said thank you, right?

10:41.508 --> 10:42.390
What else do you want from me?

10:42.391 --> 10:43.273
You could have thanked me
before you went

10:43.276 --> 10:44.776
and fucked a 20 year old.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.911
Slow down, all right. I did not
do nothin'-

10:46.913 --> 10:48.747
Oh see another lie.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.949
And I'm pretty sure that that's
not a lie okay.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.302
What?

10:53.303 --> 10:55.654
You say you're at school, but
it's not on your schedule.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.288
You say you're with Mosey, but
really you were

10:57.290 --> 10:59.524
with those BMCC girls.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.726
I like your place.
Thanks.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.564
How's the rent?
I don't talk about it.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.834
Your girlfriend handle the
decorating?

11:10.704 --> 11:13.772
Yeah, yeah, she's
got a little skill.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.275
She fixed this place up.
Before she moved in,

11:17.277 --> 11:19.444
all I did was decorate with
magazines.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.514
I've actually been looking for
a place.

11:22.516 --> 11:26.284
Are there any spots open like
this?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.119
No.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.556
The only way to get a place
like this

11:31.558 --> 11:35.193
is to be really rich or to live
here your whole life

11:35.195 --> 11:36.928
and wait for your
parents to die.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.364
You just saying that because

11:39.366 --> 11:40.865
you don't want me to live here.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.201
No, it's true, my mom
owns this building

11:43.203 --> 11:44.369
and you know she
wants to kick me out

11:44.371 --> 11:46.171
so she can get more for rent.

11:46.173 --> 11:50.375
So the idea that I'm gonna help
you, is not very likely.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.412
So basically you don't want no
trouble?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.083
Oh see now you're just messing
with me.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.154
So you gonna tell me you don't
feel what's happening?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.322
With what?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.290
With you and me?

12:07.761 --> 12:08.660
What?

12:09.996 --> 12:13.665
Nate, I heard about you, stop.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.903
All right, listen,
all right, okay,

12:18.905 --> 12:21.706
sometimes I get a little
reckless if there's a party,

12:21.708 --> 12:26.544
but this is my girlfriend's
place, too,

12:26.546 --> 12:30.548
so if we're done studying,
you know...

12:30.550 --> 12:32.350
You wasn't talking about her
last week

12:32.352 --> 12:33.418
when we was dancing.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.955
Okay yeah I was flirting with
you, but--

12:36.957 --> 12:37.789
You flirt with everybody.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.207
I'm a DJ.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.624
That's what' DJs do,
that's how I get tips.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.060
- A DJ?
- Yeah, I gotta

12:42.062 --> 12:44.062
flirt a little bit.
- Listen.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.365
You and I connect on
some real shit.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.570
♪ You know what you get ♪

12:52.572 --> 12:54.973
♪ Everyday is Christmas ♪

12:54.975 --> 12:58.877
♪ Oh yeah there ain't no
conditions ♪

13:01.148 --> 13:06.217
Oh okay, yeah you, music is
definitely more your thing.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.388
You like that?
Yeah, that was really--

13:13.226 --> 13:18.296
Okay, Justine, you are young
enough to be my niece.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.434
Don't you have a boyfriend?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.503
He plays basketball
for St. Johns.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.572
It's an open relationship.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.275
Yeah, I guess that's the way
you'd have to go with that.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.776
You got condoms?

13:31.778 --> 13:36.347
That's you kids don't
mince, do you?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.683
Why waste time with words?

13:38.685 --> 13:43.421
I'm hot, you're a six,
let's do this.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.625
Okay listen, Justine, I know
what you think

13:47.627 --> 13:49.394
is going to happen, but I--

13:50.964 --> 13:54.532
Okay six, a six is your bottom
for getting freaky?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.602
This isn't getting freaky.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.903
This is studying.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.173
That's why I thought you called
me here today,

14:02.175 --> 14:05.343
the whole group canceled, it's
just me and you.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.213
I thought I was helping you out.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.984
You did, thanks.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.885
Yeah.

14:13.887 --> 14:19.557
Listen, I've always been
attracted to older men.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.227
Oh man, there it is, see I knew
that was gonna come.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.494
Facts.
Thank you Justine.

14:23.496 --> 14:27.198
Yeah, that's great, oh, that's
really nice.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.469
Thank you, okay.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.713
Thank you, that's

14:41.715 --> 14:43.448
let's you an Uber.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.182
You know what listen, I don't
care about your girlfriend.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.218
That that makes one of us.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.321
Yeah, but does she know what
most men want?

14:51.992 --> 14:52.991
What's that?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.659
Someone who can keep a secret.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.629
Okay, then well please keep
this one.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.432
You want me to touch him?

15:01.434 --> 15:05.503
Okay, thank you, no, you've got
to go, you've got to go.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.039
I'm not an idiot,
you fucked her.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.374
I did not.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.176
I love how every time you tell
the story,

15:12.178 --> 15:13.578
you are somehow the hero

15:13.580 --> 15:15.747
just trying to preserve
everyone's honor.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.416
Are you saying that isn't me?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.852
Not if it's the same Justine
who takes selfies

15:20.854 --> 15:22.186
with her ass sticking out.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.226
Learn how to close your apps.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.428
You practically live on her
Instagram.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.866
Okay, well you're
worse than the NSA.

15:34.868 --> 15:38.536
Nate, I know you
think you're smart,

15:38.538 --> 15:39.904
but you're not smart.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.040
You're stupid, okay?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.408
You're stupid,
you didn't even try to hide it

15:43.410 --> 15:45.476
you left her fucking
wine glass out

15:45.478 --> 15:47.078
with the lip stain all over it.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.247
Justine brought the wine, she
was trying to impress me

15:49.249 --> 15:52.250
because I'm so dope, like you
used to try to impress me,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.252
but you don't anymore, because
you don't think I'm dope.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.287
You know the whole place smelled
of her cheap ass perfume.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.056
That's not my fault.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.891
You changed the sheets.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.397
You didn't clean up anything
else she left behind,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.433
but you changed the sheets,

16:08.435 --> 16:10.468
you made sure to change the
sheets.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.369
Why is that?

16:13.974 --> 16:16.374
Since when have you ever even
about doing that?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.079
Well.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.016
Of course.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.919
You don't have an answer
because you're guilty.

16:27.921 --> 16:28.953
I'm not guilty.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.289
You changed the sheets.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.590
I didn't sleep with that chick.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.792
You changed the sheets.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.695
- Yeah because--
- Because you slept with her

16:37.697 --> 16:39.831
in our bed, well you keep the
bed now.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.967
I just said that she came over

16:41.968 --> 16:44.102
and things got a little hot,
but I got a hard-on okay,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.771
I'll admit that shit, but
nothing happened with her.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.174
Okay, I kicked her out and
frankly kicking her out

16:50.176 --> 16:51.509
didn't do shit for my blue
balls,

16:51.511 --> 16:54.379
so I went into the bedroom and
I stroked it off

16:54.381 --> 16:58.616
and you know I got a little on
the sheets and pillows,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.719
well I got a LOT, a lot on the
sheets and pillows,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.855
because even if it's only three
minutes,

17:03.857 --> 17:05.522
I'm like Lexington Steele when
I pop,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.192
I mean that shit was just
everywhere so I just

17:08.194 --> 17:10.694
gathered everything up, put it
in the laundry bag,

17:10.696 --> 17:13.397
didn't have time to wash it and
get it back on the,

17:14.501 --> 17:15.800
you were about to come home.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.269
I'm just lucky you didn't walk
in with a black light.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.539
See?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.508
Look, the gears are turning,

17:23.510 --> 17:25.877
see you know that I'm telling
the truth.

17:25.878 --> 17:30.548
I, I don't... Maybe

17:33.753 --> 17:36.020
it's stupid enough to be true.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.655
And you just called me stupid.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.995
I was wondering why the sheets
didn't smell

17:43.997 --> 17:47.398
of her perfume, you didn't have
time to wash them

17:47.400 --> 17:52.370
and there were never any hairs
or other fluids.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.838
Who the hell are you supposed
to be, CSI?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.206
Of course there were no other
hairs or fluids,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.542
just my man juice, a pretty
girl came onto me,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.510
so I stroked it off, sue me!

18:02.715 --> 18:05.950
Whoa, is this what, that's what
this is about?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.052
That's what you had to go on?

18:08.054 --> 18:10.688
Cora said--
Cora said?!? Oh!

18:12.225 --> 18:13.124
Cora said?!?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.461
Cora's the one fucking up my
shit right now

18:16.463 --> 18:18.696
because I like to jerk off in
bed

18:18.698 --> 18:21.799
instead of in front of a
computer, like your brother.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.102
She said it seemed suspicious.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.571
Well, she was wrong, wasn't she?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.139
It did seemed suspicious.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.209
It seemed suspicious because
she made it up.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.311
That doesn't make any fucking
sense!

18:33.313 --> 18:35.947
All right fine, you didn't
cheat, happy?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.816
That's the best you got?

18:38.818 --> 18:39.851
I'm sorry, Nate.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.829
It's okay, I forgive you.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.933
'Cuz I love you we just suck at
communicating

18:55.935 --> 18:58.402
and I'm gonna do a better job
of letting you in.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.073
I've been watching a lot of OWN,

19:03.009 --> 19:05.209
because I'm trying to fix all
of this.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.980
I just have to go Nate.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.654
And now I want tea, shit.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.129
Okay, when people have trouble
communicating,

19:25.131 --> 19:27.165
they talk it out or they get
help,

19:27.167 --> 19:28.432
only punks cut and run.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.834
Then I'm a punk.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.436
Okay, but you're not still mad
at me, right?

19:32.438 --> 19:33.387
- What?
- Well I mean

19:33.388 --> 19:34.337
this whole breakup thing was
because

19:34.340 --> 19:35.940
you thought that I hit it with
Justine,

19:35.942 --> 19:38.476
which I did not, so.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.712
Not everything is about you and
Justine,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.582
and besides I don't know that
you didn't sleep with her.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.685
Yeah, but you have doubts
though.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.221
I have doubts about Justine.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.557
I don't have doubts there were
others.

19:54.127 --> 19:57.195
Why do you think I didn't sleep
with Justine?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.796
- Can we stop--
- No no no no,

19:58.798 --> 20:01.566
seriously, do you have any idea
why I didn't sleep with her?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.218
Tell me.

20:03.219 --> 20:04.869
Because flirting is automatic,
not emotion.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.974
Yeah, that is right and she's a
knucklehead.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.644
Why am I gonna get emotional
over some knucklehead for, huh?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.346
Knucklehead's can't measure up
to the future

20:15.348 --> 20:17.181
that you and I were building. I
didn't sleep with Justine

20:17.183 --> 20:19.750
because I believed in us.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.319
I didn't hit it for the same
reason

20:21.321 --> 20:22.820
that you never cheated on me.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.057
What?

20:29.829 --> 20:32.697
This is gonna be a tough
midterm.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.764
Not if we've done our jobs
right.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.168
We both teach sixth grade, but
I don't think

20:37.170 --> 20:39.270
as much of my students
as you do.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.038
This shit is hard.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.908
Jason, it's just a midterm.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.311
You want some more tea?

20:52.185 --> 20:56.854
You know it shouldn't be a crime
to challenge sixth graders.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.157
That's what I teach my students,
what do you teach yours?

21:02.362 --> 21:03.394
Mostly what their rights are

21:03.396 --> 21:06.464
if ever they're held by the
police.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.069
So where's Nate tonight?

21:12.071 --> 21:14.238
DJing some college party.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.339
But it's Wednesday.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.875
He had his midterms too.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.046
Guess he's letting off some
steam with his friends.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.682
You don't want to go?

21:26.252 --> 21:28.386
Please. I'm over it.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.289
These are his college years,
let him has his fun.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.459
Oh well, it's great that you
also support him.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.495
We have an understanding.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.496
Well he's lucky.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.837
But you deserve to have some
fun too.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.574
Right?

21:50.576 --> 21:53.277
♪ One with each rising and
setting of the sun ♪

21:53.279 --> 21:56.180
♪ Whatever may come, I'm about
to have fun ♪

21:56.182 --> 21:57.648
♪ Cut my losses, grin it and
bear it ♪

21:57.650 --> 21:59.450
♪ Rather I bury it,
don't force it ♪

21:59.452 --> 22:00.951
♪ And won't forfeit ♪

22:14.934 --> 22:19.704
So he starts getting these
phone calls

22:19.706 --> 22:21.205
at four in the morning.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.342
I know what's going on,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.679
but what's the point in
complaining now?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.582
He's what I deserve.

22:33.786 --> 22:38.789
Hey, hey, you don't deserve
anything but to be happy.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.563
We don't even talk about
marriage anymore.

22:48.901 --> 22:49.934
You're engaged?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.037
I'm getting married this summer.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.273
Happy?

23:01.914 --> 23:02.813
Very.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.272
That's some slutty shit!

23:28.274 --> 23:30.541
I hate you!
Obviously!

23:30.543 --> 23:32.343
Oh sure, now you want tea.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.412
Well at least I don't have to
smoke or drink

23:34.414 --> 23:36.447
at all hours of the day like
some people.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.883
No, only when you're cheating
on some people!

23:38.885 --> 23:41.485
I didn't cheat, I was
retaliating!

23:45.458 --> 23:47.792
Get the hell out of here?

23:48.561 --> 23:49.527
She said that?

23:49.529 --> 23:50.361
How?

23:50.363 --> 23:51.562
How?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.230
Because you slept with Justine
in our bed.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.749
What?

23:54.750 --> 23:56.267
You just said that you know I
didn't sleep with Justine.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.701
I didn't know that at the time

23:57.703 --> 24:00.204
and even if it wasn't Justine,
there were others Nate,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.306
in other beds, don't lie to me.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.641
There were others.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.343
Oh!

24:08.748 --> 24:10.047
She flipped it like that?

24:10.049 --> 24:13.451
Yup.
Yo real talk.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.686
I didn't think she had it in
her like that.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.490
And she knows that nothing
happened with Justine?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.058
Yeah.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.126
But she gave this guy some trim

24:22.128 --> 24:23.661
to get back at you for screwing
her?

24:23.663 --> 24:24.562
Yeah.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.732
And she definitely fucked him
in your bed?

24:28.734 --> 24:29.600
Yes.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.435
She washed the sheets?

24:31.437 --> 24:32.269
Yeah, she must have dude, I
didn't even

24:32.271 --> 24:33.471
know about it till yesterday.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.139
Whoa!

24:36.976 --> 24:40.377
Hey, see that's how they do.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.513
Hell, Nate, how do you keep from

24:42.515 --> 24:45.015
blowing your brains out man?

24:45.017 --> 24:46.617
That's some ruthless shit that
she did there.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.518
No it ain't.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.787
It's justice.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.255
Are you serious, Lou?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.524
Your boy got played.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.428
Look, you're my man
50-stacks-shirt-off-my-back,

24:57.430 --> 24:58.929
but you know was dead wrong for
messing

24:58.931 --> 25:01.365
with that young girl or any of
them girls for that matter.

25:01.367 --> 25:02.867
You're supposed to be in here
getting your life together,

25:02.869 --> 25:04.101
trying to get up out the shop,

25:04.103 --> 25:05.536
but instead you running around
here

25:05.538 --> 25:08.138
like you're on Love and Hip
Hop. That's your problem.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.657
You know what your problem is?

25:09.658 --> 25:11.175
You think you can solve everything
with your stupid rhymes.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.676
Whether it happened or not,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.812
you wanted me to think that you
fucked

25:14.814 --> 25:16.947
or could have fucked those
stupid college girls.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.682
That is what your ego is about,

25:18.684 --> 25:20.184
making yourself believe you
have a big dick

25:20.186 --> 25:22.453
and making me feel like shit.

25:22.455 --> 25:24.288
How can they be stupid if
they're in college?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.624
I was stupid in college.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.791
What?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.126
You know what?

25:29.127 --> 25:30.460
Maybe I wouldn't have to cheat
if every time

25:30.463 --> 25:32.997
we had sex you didn't have to
wait for it to be over.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.365
I wouldn't have to cheated if
you didn't smell

25:34.367 --> 25:36.233
like Patchouli, Hennessy and
weed every time

25:36.235 --> 25:37.368
you climbed on top of me.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.802
That doesn't even matter.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.204
You brought another dude here.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.740
You shouldn't be moving out, I
should be kicking you out.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.843
And what should have been the
final straw for me?

25:45.845 --> 25:48.279
How many chances did I give you
before Justine?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.850
Nothing happened with Justine.

25:52.852 --> 25:57.755
What about April, Lexi,
Cinnamon?

26:00.026 --> 26:02.526
Oh yeah yeah, I know about her,

26:02.528 --> 26:06.864
that you put a part of your
body into the mouth

26:06.866 --> 26:10.234
of someone named Cinnamon.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.070
I don't even know how I can
look at you.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.506
How'd you find out about that?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.709
What is that? You didn't win
anything,

26:18.711 --> 26:20.444
you just slept with a married
man.

26:20.446 --> 26:21.912
Engaged.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.681
Same difference,
he's married now.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.916
Well, it was only once and
that's something

26:25.918 --> 26:28.719
that Jason and his wife will
have to figure out.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.388
This is the same woman that
teaches children.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.390
How do you get to judge me
after what you did?

26:33.392 --> 26:37.094
I get to judge you after five
years of cheating on me.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.295
Yeah, for all you know,
all my cheating

26:38.297 --> 26:41.865
was exaggerated, but what you
did was premeditated.

26:41.867 --> 26:42.700
No.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.068
Yeah, yeah, that's what you do,

26:44.070 --> 26:46.036
you just brought him over here
to seduce you.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.338
No.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.639
I know what you do, you find
some little idiot

26:48.641 --> 26:50.274
off the banana boat and you
bide your time

26:50.276 --> 26:52.710
and then you claws into, your
fangs into him.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.445
I know how that works.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.947
I didn't bring him over here to
seduce him.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.717
I knew that he would try to
seduce me

26:59.719 --> 27:01.051
and I figured I'd just let the
chips fall

27:01.053 --> 27:02.953
wherever they may fall and--

27:02.955 --> 27:05.322
That's some whore shit. Whore!
Whore!

27:05.324 --> 27:07.992
Cinnamon, Cinnamon, Cinnamon!

27:07.994 --> 27:10.628
♪ Day-O Day-O Day-O ♪

27:10.630 --> 27:12.229
It doesn't matter what you say
about Justine,

27:12.231 --> 27:13.964
you're a liar, I didn't just get

27:13.966 --> 27:16.066
pictures off your phone, stupid.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.570
You know what?

27:19.572 --> 27:21.138
Good, get the fuck out of here.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.507
I'm gonna need you to move your
stuff off my desk.

27:23.509 --> 27:24.742
Don't worry I'm moving it.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.410
I've been asking you all week
so--

27:26.412 --> 27:28.812
Hey, I said I'm moving it,
you're still packing.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.948
Well now I'm kinda in a hurry.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.491
What took you so long?

27:40.493 --> 27:42.593
I told you I wanted to be out
by noon.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.529
Talk to Cora, I was ready.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.364
She had me waiting outside her
place for like 45 minutes.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.533
I didn't know what to wear.

27:49.535 --> 27:52.102
We're moving dusty boxes, does
it matter?

27:52.104 --> 27:54.004
They're dusty boxes?

27:54.006 --> 27:56.006
Okay do you have a shirt I can
borrow?

27:58.044 --> 27:59.610
Look if I get a ticket, you're
paying it.

27:59.612 --> 28:01.445
I told you I would, didn't I?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.480
Look, that's my mother-in-law's
van,

28:03.482 --> 28:04.481
I finally got her liking me.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.616
I don't need you messing that
up.

28:05.618 --> 28:06.984
You know how hard it is to get

28:06.986 --> 28:09.453
a Dominican mother-in-law to
like a black dude?

28:10.656 --> 28:12.089
That shit is muy difficulto.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.161
Damn, you got mad shit up in
here.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.062
Will it fit?

28:19.031 --> 28:20.247
Well, we gonna make it fit,

28:20.248 --> 28:21.464
because I ain't coming back
here.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.367
- Melissa, shirt?
- Come on.

28:25.638 --> 28:26.537
Hi, Nate.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.906
Yo kiss my ass, Cora.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.208
- Ah shit.
- Yeah shit.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.343
What'd you tell her, what'd you
tell her?

28:33.345 --> 28:35.179
I told her the truth.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.214
That what, Justine was
suspicious?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.684
She was, it was, the whole
thing was suspicious.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.486
Why, we're working together?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.221
Why did you have to work here?

28:44.223 --> 28:48.826
Because study group, that's why.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.060
Yo, is this desk coming with--

28:50.062 --> 28:51.462
I'm moving it, damn.

28:52.665 --> 28:54.131
The fuck is he talking to?

28:56.168 --> 28:57.401
You told her to check the
sheets.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.036
That's what I would have done
in her situation.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.904
But you're never in her
situation,

29:00.906 --> 29:01.839
because you don't get attached.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.708
And this is why, the pain.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.010
Men are pigs and you're a man,
so...

29:07.012 --> 29:08.212
This is what you're listening
to.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.848
Nate, at the very least you
should not have been

29:10.850 --> 29:13.884
studying alone with another
woman in the apartment

29:13.886 --> 29:15.786
you share with girlfriend.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.521
I mean come on, dude, did you
not think

29:17.523 --> 29:19.490
that will make her feel
uncomfortable?

29:21.293 --> 29:22.192
Okay.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.262
I'm sorry.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.764
Thank you.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.031
We can agree on something.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.367
Nothing happened with Justine.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.469
Says you, why don't you tell
her that shit,

29:32.471 --> 29:34.371
you tell her all my other
business in the street,

29:34.373 --> 29:35.939
why don't you tell her that
shit?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.107
Tell her.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.309
His story actually makes sense.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.577
- In your face!
- Okay, well what

29:40.579 --> 29:41.779
about the sheets?

29:41.781 --> 29:43.280
Don't worry about my sheets.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.149
You keep your mind
out of my sheets.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.567
I don't worry about the sheets?

29:46.568 --> 29:47.984
No, you don't worry about, no
we don't gotta

29:47.987 --> 29:48.952
talk about my sheets anymore.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.621
Fine, well what--
Point is you were wrong.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.756
- Whatever, whatever.
- You were wrong.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.925
Whatever, you won one,
congratulations Nate.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.460
Why can't you just mind your
own business?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.495
She's my best friend,
she is my business.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.497
So why don't you get
some facts before you

30:00.499 --> 30:02.566
spread out advice like diarrhea?

30:02.568 --> 30:05.068
I don't understand
Nate.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.970
Are you angry because
we were right

30:06.972 --> 30:08.639
that you did have
another woman here

30:08.641 --> 30:10.240
or that I care about my friend?

30:14.079 --> 30:16.947
Get out of my house,
you first, quickly,

30:16.949 --> 30:18.816
get the fuck out. Now.

30:18.818 --> 30:19.783
He's gonna change his tone.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.585
He's gonna stop cussing at me.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.026
What?

30:29.995 --> 30:31.795
I'm not gonna miss you.

30:31.797 --> 30:32.996
Ted, we were never fucking.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.966
Yeah, because I never liked you.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.101
I'm pretty sure that's not the
only reason.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.772
I mean she helps you get on
your feet

30:41.774 --> 30:44.608
and you repay her by messing
around with sluts.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.043
They're called students.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.613
I don't know what took us so
long

30:49.615 --> 30:54.685
to see that you are cocky,
narcissistic, no talent nobody.

30:55.387 --> 30:59.289
You're nothing but a pretend DJ
and a terrible barber.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.992
I ain't forget how you fucked
up my head.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.127
If my mother was alive to see
what a piece of shit

31:04.129 --> 31:05.796
my sister wound up with,

31:05.798 --> 31:08.131
she'd never stop stabbing her
eyes out.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.836
Are you gonna help me
move this shit,

31:12.838 --> 31:14.204
so you can hurry up and get
back to the top

31:14.206 --> 31:16.907
of the Empire State Building,
motherfucker?

31:16.909 --> 31:19.843
You look like the fifth Ninja
Turtle, the brown one.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.979
Yeah, get that one, move that
shit Kong.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.417
Girl, I lent this to you like a
year ago.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.819
Well now you have it back.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.721
I wanted to get your
clothes dirty.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.528
What's wrong?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.797
How am I any different from
Nate?

31:42.368 --> 31:43.901
If he didn't really sleep with
that chick

31:43.903 --> 31:47.537
then me and Jason,
that was for nothing.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.206
No it wasn't.

31:49.208 --> 31:53.176
Girl, Jason is hot, Nate is
like a three.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.179
Why did I even listen to you?

31:56.181 --> 31:58.015
Revenge fucking, what am I, 19?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.384
Okay, I'm sorry I was wrong
about

32:00.386 --> 32:02.152
one thing, I'm not perfect.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.022
But you wouldn't stop talking
about it,

32:05.024 --> 32:06.156
so I know you had fun.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.594
I couldn't stop talking about
it because I felt guilty.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.463
Yeah right, guilty, #humblebrag.

32:18.871 --> 32:21.104
So nothing happened with her?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.673
Who, Justine?

32:23.742 --> 32:24.942
No.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.643
So you're honestly going to
stand there

32:26.645 --> 32:27.978
and tell us that you've
never been

32:27.980 --> 32:29.947
with any other woman besides
Melissa?

32:33.152 --> 32:34.151
Nah, you know what's--

32:34.153 --> 32:36.486
No, don't worry about what I
know.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.822
We're concerned with what I
don't know.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.891
Because if you can
actually say no,

32:40.892 --> 32:42.959
then maybe we were wrong and
this can be worked out.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.498
All right, well once.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.167
- Once?
- See?

32:50.169 --> 32:52.736
Cinnamon, Cinnamon I told you
about her.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.471
Yeah, yeah that's why you're
admitting it.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.907
Cinnamon?!? You fucked a
stripper is what you're saying.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.125
She's a stripper.

32:58.126 --> 32:59.342
First of all, she's not a
stripper.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.346
She goes to church every Sunday
and it was once.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.981
Once.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.082
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.185
Because I vividly remember
seeing you

33:08.187 --> 33:11.288
at a bar in Williamsburg
flirting with

33:11.290 --> 33:14.291
some Asian chick in a Mets cap.

33:14.293 --> 33:18.328
You disappeared into the
bathroom for like 15 minutes.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.765
I saw you, but you definitely
didn't see me.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.634
- Okay, maybe twice.
- Twice?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.837
- Oh.
- Ain't shit motherfucker.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.138
- That's what I'm saying.
- Three, four, five, six.

33:28.140 --> 33:28.972
What did I tell you about this
guy?

33:28.974 --> 33:29.806
Why?
What?

33:29.808 --> 33:31.174
I told you--
The whole time

33:31.176 --> 33:32.342
he was lying.
- Want to give it

33:32.344 --> 33:33.263
to me that I don't know?
- This is not what

33:33.264 --> 33:34.183
mommy would have wanted.
- All right, don't even

33:34.184 --> 33:35.103
go there right now.
- You slept with some

33:35.104 --> 33:36.023
hard heads.
- Look at him.

33:36.024 --> 33:36.943
You don't listen.
- Ganging up on me for.

33:36.949 --> 33:38.048
Hi Nate.
- What's up man?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.317
Yeah, sure.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.552
See man that's the thing about
you, right?

33:42.554 --> 33:44.788
You can't be trusted, first
it's once,

33:44.790 --> 33:47.057
then it's twice, then it's just
an Asian chick

33:47.059 --> 33:48.558
in a bar bathroom.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.993
- What's up, Mosey?
- What's up, man?

33:49.995 --> 33:53.030
- Did I come at a bad time?
- No no, fuck these ghosts.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.667
- Want some of this?
- Yeah man, I'll hit that.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.102
Want to borrow something else?

34:01.073 --> 34:02.639
Oh, man, if I could...

34:02.641 --> 34:04.541
Yeah, man hit them stacks.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.513
Ooh, I can't wait till we get
rid of you.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.081
See you're a piece of shit man,

34:11.083 --> 34:12.248
you've got piece of shit
friends.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.083
Whoa whoa.
- And you like

34:13.085 --> 34:14.418
piece of shit girls.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.487
Yo, you should take
that back man,

34:17.489 --> 34:19.222
because I love your sister.

34:19.224 --> 34:22.826
Pssh, doubt it, you only seem
to love yourself.

34:22.828 --> 34:23.659
Ted, you don't even know what
the fuck

34:23.661 --> 34:24.995
you're talking about man.

34:24.996 --> 34:25.829
Hey get the fuck out of my way.

34:25.830 --> 34:26.661
She's not no saint, now what
you telling

34:26.665 --> 34:28.197
my boy Ted here?

34:28.199 --> 34:29.732
Gotta all up in the clouds, she
ain't no saint, dude.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.368
Word?
- Yeah, that's right.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.652
You know what she did?

34:32.654 --> 34:33.937
She brought another dude back
here to fuck him.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.505
That's right, son.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.773
Oh, you didn't know about that.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.208
You didn't tell Ted all about
this shit?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.944
Yeah, she got another dude back
here to fuck him

34:40.946 --> 34:42.946
all because she thought that I
cheated on her,

34:42.947 --> 34:45.114
which I did not, everyone
should know that

34:45.117 --> 34:47.284
I did not cheat on her, that
shit should be canon by now.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.385
Nate, just shut up.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.786
What, what, Ted wants to make
judgements,

34:49.788 --> 34:51.521
he should make all the
judgments.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.456
She slept with some guy?

34:53.458 --> 34:54.623
That's right.

34:56.462 --> 35:00.263
So I'm supposed to be on your
side now?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.533
Yeah, she's stupid.

35:03.535 --> 35:06.603
Look man, I love her too, but
she's stupid

35:06.605 --> 35:08.105
for sticking around with

35:08.107 --> 35:10.273
your poot butt ass for so damn
long.

35:10.275 --> 35:14.544
Look man, she's a lady and you
like club hos.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.314
Club?

35:17.316 --> 35:19.316
This nigger, club hos?

35:19.318 --> 35:21.985
Look man, we knew this wasn't
going to last, right?

35:21.987 --> 35:23.987
Some clown that she met in the
subway,

35:23.989 --> 35:26.523
look she would have been better
off with the rats.

35:29.061 --> 35:31.094
Oh pump your breaks, nigger,
subway,

35:31.096 --> 35:32.762
the fuck you talking about, you
told,

35:32.764 --> 35:35.732
you told him we
met on the subway?

35:41.406 --> 35:42.572
How long are we staying?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.908
- As long as you want.
- I want to leave now.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.478
No stop it, come on
we're gonna have fun, yas?

35:49.414 --> 35:50.247
You made it!

35:52.417 --> 35:54.518
Of course, where's your boy?

35:54.520 --> 35:55.685
Over there.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.588
My niggas!

36:01.193 --> 36:03.860
Okay, birthday boy getting
funky.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.933
You ladies want some drinks?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.501
They got bottled beer?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.303
I think they got a Corona or
something.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.071
I'll take one of those.
Unopened.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.774
Okay. For you?

36:19.111 --> 36:23.380
Just give me something special,
surprise me.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.048
All right, I'll be back.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.951
Just give me something special.

36:27.953 --> 36:28.952
You're just asking to get
roofied.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.020
Just being nice.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.321
You hardly know him.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.856
What is your problem?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.724
You said you would try to have
a good time tonight.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.626
And you told me we were going
to a movie.

36:36.628 --> 36:41.698
This is better, come on, chill
out, mingle.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.803
Or you can just call him back
and tell him

36:47.806 --> 36:49.222
that you've changed your mind

36:49.223 --> 36:50.639
and that you'll marry him and
move to Cleveland.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.709
- Columbus.
- What?

36:52.711 --> 36:55.212
Vincent wants to get married
and move to Columbus.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.913
How is that better?

36:58.650 --> 37:01.218
Dranks, dranks, dranks.
Mm.

37:02.487 --> 37:06.456
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.360
Once upon a time in Kings
County Hospital,

37:10.362 --> 37:12.762
a black boy was born,

37:12.764 --> 37:16.833
this boy is all Brooklyn, he's
all black.

37:16.835 --> 37:21.605
His is Bud Baxter. Today's his
birthday!

37:23.875 --> 37:24.941
I don't know a single
motherfucker here,

37:24.943 --> 37:26.576
but I love you all tonight.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.279
Thanks for showin' love.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.784
Yeah, but you know I'm tired,

38:40.786 --> 38:42.752
I've been doing this all night,
I haven't even had

38:42.754 --> 38:44.988
a chance to have my little
birthday beer yet,

38:44.990 --> 38:47.524
so they all just chill and
listen to Shuffle.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.327
It's a nice party.

38:51.863 --> 38:52.762
Really?

38:53.699 --> 38:55.432
I don't even know these people.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.166
- But you are the birth--
- No no, you see,

38:57.169 --> 39:02.238
Instagram, Facebook,
Chemistry.com, MySpace,

39:02.708 --> 39:04.974
people just want to know where
the open bar is.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.712
Well I'm not on my MySpace,
Facebook or Instagram.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.080
You're not on Instagram?!?

39:12.484 --> 39:13.783
Damn.

39:13.785 --> 39:14.718
My friend Cora.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.887
I don't know who that is.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.255
She came with Trent?

39:21.360 --> 39:22.926
He said he was your boy.

39:24.463 --> 39:28.164
No, no, I just didn't want to
celebrate 30 alone.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.134
Well, that's depressing.
You sure don't know

39:31.136 --> 39:33.236
anyone else at this party?

39:34.506 --> 39:39.542
Um, I know those two guys over
there look like barbers.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.813
Uh, I know that guy.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.284
Oh. Well, I'm Melissa.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.823
Now I know you. I'm Nate.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.260
Why don't you tell me something
about yourself, Melissa?

39:57.262 --> 40:01.931
Well, I really love teaching.

40:01.933 --> 40:06.069
I'm a really good swimmer and I
don't know how to drive.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.105
Okay.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.142
Tell me something about
yourself.

40:15.347 --> 40:18.081
I'm very lazy.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.349
And I'm very high class.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.317
I love to eat.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.119
That's it?

40:25.023 --> 40:26.956
I'm also pretty close to my
mother.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.815
I would be like put it in a
frame, but like

41:25.817 --> 41:29.586
I'm okay with this, like this
isn't tacky, you know

41:29.588 --> 41:32.989
I think it's like the
composition you know.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.791
- Yeah.
- So do you do you

41:34.793 --> 41:35.925
live here by yourself?

41:37.095 --> 41:37.994
Yeah.

41:40.165 --> 41:43.166
Yeah, I like love this
neighborhood.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.002
How do you even afford this?

41:47.639 --> 41:48.838
I grew up here.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.442
My mom owns this place, so I'm
never gonna leave.

41:52.444 --> 41:55.778
Shit, well you let me know if
you want a roommate.

41:56.615 --> 41:57.680
All right.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.108
It's empty, do you mind?

42:26.344 --> 42:27.243
No doubt.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.747
- Melissa?
- I'm good.

42:30.749 --> 42:31.648
Okay.

42:35.854 --> 42:38.388
This is you, kid.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.790
Don't fuck it up, they want it.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.526
- What are you doing?
- What?

42:43.528 --> 42:44.761
- Leave.
- Are you kidding?

42:44.763 --> 42:48.264
Do you see the chemistry that
we have?

42:48.266 --> 42:51.367
You've trained for this, pace
yourself.

42:51.369 --> 42:52.502
You have a guy.

42:53.405 --> 42:57.206
Yeah, well he turned out to be
a loser, so...

42:57.208 --> 42:59.008
And you only discovered this
after having

42:59.010 --> 43:01.044
your tongue down his
throat all night?

43:01.046 --> 43:02.845
How else you gonna find out?

43:02.847 --> 43:05.014
But who gets you first?

43:05.016 --> 43:06.382
I mean what if I die during it?

43:06.384 --> 43:08.585
I mean they're both pretty hot,
like an eight,

43:09.454 --> 43:11.187
but what if they die during it?

43:11.189 --> 43:13.323
I'm pretty hot, like a nine.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.125
I can't handle no dead bodies.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.294
He didn't even invite
you back here.

43:18.296 --> 43:19.963
You just glommed on.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.631
Oh, he wants me here,
believe that.

43:21.633 --> 43:23.466
Yeah, the way
you're throwing it at him.

43:23.468 --> 43:26.469
I don't have to throw
all of this.

43:26.471 --> 43:28.237
What's wrong with you?

43:28.239 --> 43:31.307
You don't even like Cora how
did she get back here?

43:31.309 --> 43:33.109
Damn, these chicks stick
together.

43:34.379 --> 43:37.213
Oh shit, it's a cock block.

43:37.215 --> 43:39.983
Damn it, I walked into another
cock block.

43:39.985 --> 43:41.651
All right girl it's time for
you to go.

43:41.653 --> 43:46.422
Okay, I will let you
have this one,

43:46.424 --> 43:48.491
only because you
never have any fun.

43:48.493 --> 43:50.059
I'm sure you'll make it up by
fucking

43:50.061 --> 43:52.328
someone after church tomorrow.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.897
Ah you see how you got bitch in
you?

43:54.899 --> 43:57.967
That's why you about to have
dick in you!

44:05.343 --> 44:06.476
Who says that?

44:52.157 --> 44:53.440
Gave it up on the
first night son!

44:53.441 --> 44:54.724
Two out of three holes right
there, your sister.

44:54.726 --> 44:56.159
Why are you playing with my man
Ted like that?

44:56.161 --> 44:57.126
He don't know what
a freak you are?

44:57.128 --> 44:59.362
Yo, you better shut
the fuck up man.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.563
What are you saying, man?

45:00.565 --> 45:01.998
What are you saying?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.833
That's what she did, that's
what we're talking about,

45:03.835 --> 45:04.834
that's what you wanted to know.

45:04.836 --> 45:06.969
Yo Ted, it was just sex from
the giddy up,

45:06.971 --> 45:09.405
straight up jump street, you
know why?

45:09.407 --> 45:12.442
Because that's how I role man,
that's what Bud Baxter do.

45:13.578 --> 45:15.311
Man, shut the fuck up.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.396
What the fuck is wrong
with you nigger?

45:16.397 --> 45:17.480
Oh now, I got this shit, I got
this shit, no man,

45:17.482 --> 45:19.749
what's up, you want to step,
step to me man.

45:19.751 --> 45:20.583
I'll take both you out
motherfuckers.

45:20.585 --> 45:21.618
Oh really?

45:21.619 --> 45:22.652
Let me explain
something to you Ted,

45:22.654 --> 45:24.854
mixing it up, meet some couple
of hotty pants,

45:24.856 --> 45:26.155
they want to get in your
fucking pants,

45:26.157 --> 45:27.490
you bring them back to your
apartment,

45:27.492 --> 45:28.725
show them that's exposed brick,

45:28.727 --> 45:32.095
they get all fucking wet. Those
panties come off, nigger.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.396
- Shut the fuck up.
- Nate!

45:33.398 --> 45:35.164
What, don't even act like I
wasn't gonna get

45:35.166 --> 45:38.901
that threesome, that shit was
on the fucking table.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.236
I could have had you both
upside down on a sex swing--

45:40.238 --> 45:41.387
- Nate!
- Shut up Nate!

45:41.388 --> 45:42.537
But it turned into a respectful
butt naked

45:42.540 --> 45:44.407
sex for two because your sister
has such morals.

45:44.409 --> 45:45.241
My dude!

45:45.243 --> 45:46.075
What!

45:46.911 --> 45:49.145
- Ted, Ted, no.
- Fuck you.

45:50.415 --> 45:53.950
My dude, you almost had the
triple cheeseburger.

45:53.952 --> 45:56.252
With a best friend.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.287
You my hero now.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.356
Mosey, why you ain't say
nothing?

46:00.358 --> 46:02.558
I found out when the fight
jumped off.

46:02.560 --> 46:07.063
Nate, if I was you, I'd lead
with that.

46:07.065 --> 46:07.964
Why?

46:07.966 --> 46:11.100
We giving niggers credit for
almost now?

46:12.070 --> 46:14.937
If that's the case I can almost
hook you up with Deez.

46:16.541 --> 46:17.540
Deez who?

46:17.542 --> 46:18.908
- Deez nuts in your mouth!
- Oh!

46:21.379 --> 46:24.547
- Got you, Chest!
- Deez nuts, deez nuts.

46:24.549 --> 46:25.414
But you, seriously though,

46:25.416 --> 46:27.750
so did he wear your out or what?

46:27.752 --> 46:29.285
Are you serious dude?

46:29.287 --> 46:31.921
Why would you automatically
assume that I got my ass kicked?

46:31.923 --> 46:33.389
You cut hair.

46:33.391 --> 46:36.092
So what's your saying is, if I
hadn't left

46:36.094 --> 46:39.462
your birthday party early, I
could have taken Cora home?

46:39.464 --> 46:41.597
Home to do what?

46:41.599 --> 46:43.299
To show her pictures
of you and Jesus

46:43.301 --> 46:45.468
at prom together you old
motherfucker?

46:50.008 --> 46:51.974
You know what to be
honest with you man.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.243
Even if you would
have married ol' girl,

46:54.245 --> 46:56.345
you and her brother
would have never got along.

46:56.347 --> 46:57.246
To be honest, y'all probably

46:57.248 --> 46:58.481
should have locked
hands months ago.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.849
Facts.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.784
- That's what you get punk.
- Ted stop.

47:01.786 --> 47:04.787
Bro calm down man or it's gonna
be you and me next time.

47:04.789 --> 47:06.022
I ain't got a glass jaw.

47:06.024 --> 47:08.391
- What the fuck?
- Call them like I see them.

47:10.628 --> 47:11.994
You know what,
I'm calling the cops.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.797
- No you're not.
- Oh yes I am.

47:14.799 --> 47:15.731
To hell with that.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.734
You can't do that, you know I
got a warrant.

47:23.775 --> 47:25.041
I'm calling them, you don't
live here,

47:25.043 --> 47:26.609
bring your big ass brother in
here to fuck me up,

47:26.611 --> 47:29.545
no no no you all going down,
hell with that shit.

47:33.484 --> 47:35.785
You broke my phone,
motherfucker!

47:35.787 --> 47:37.186
You're paying for that shit,
you know that right?

47:37.188 --> 47:38.888
Fuck you!

47:38.890 --> 47:40.289
- I'll pay for it.
- Really?

47:40.291 --> 47:42.391
You're gonna by some more shit
for this man?

47:42.393 --> 47:43.326
- Not now.
- Oh please

47:43.328 --> 47:46.329
shut the fuck up! Shut up!

47:46.331 --> 47:48.965
Can y'all let me go now, huh?

47:48.967 --> 47:50.333
Bro, you gonna calm down?

47:50.335 --> 47:54.604
Yeah, I'm good Hov. Damn,
Jigga Man.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.407
Baby Gap shopping ass nigger.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.647
Let's just stop talking okay?

48:13.224 --> 48:15.324
Listen man, you want me to hang
around

48:15.326 --> 48:17.260
in case he starts tripping
again?

48:17.262 --> 48:19.245
No man, I got this I
can handle it.

48:19.246 --> 48:21.229
No actually you don't, that's
why I'm asking you.

48:23.268 --> 48:25.401
His knuckles have had enough.

48:25.403 --> 48:29.739
Listen man, if he starts
tripping again, don't call me.

48:29.741 --> 48:32.074
All right, you know what you do
to defend yourself?

48:33.778 --> 48:34.777
Pull your dick out.

48:35.580 --> 48:36.980
What?

48:36.981 --> 48:38.381
Pull your dick and your balls
out.

48:38.383 --> 48:39.749
That's right, nobody want to
fight

48:39.751 --> 48:42.285
motherfucker got their dick out.

48:42.287 --> 48:43.552
Some motherfuckers tried to
jack me one night,

48:43.554 --> 48:44.754
you know what I did?

48:44.756 --> 48:46.822
Pulled my dick out, right on
them,

48:47.892 --> 48:50.192
that's right, scattered like
roaches.

48:50.194 --> 48:51.861
Nobody gonna fight you with
your dick out, man.

48:51.863 --> 48:53.529
- All right?
- All right.

48:54.365 --> 48:55.197
Take care of yourself man.

48:55.199 --> 48:56.966
- Got you.
- All right. Thank you.

48:56.968 --> 48:57.400
Love you, boy.

49:21.092 --> 49:21.924
Just pick up the other stuff.

49:21.926 --> 49:23.092
I don't need your help, Nate.

49:23.094 --> 49:25.361
You want to get out of here
sooner or not?

49:35.173 --> 49:36.772
Next time you want to give
someone advice,

49:36.774 --> 49:38.307
why don't you tell her to get
some movers?

49:38.309 --> 49:39.809
My advice is not the reason

49:39.811 --> 49:42.244
you cheated on Melissa, so
we're clear.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.416
Can't you stop?

49:47.418 --> 49:48.651
We could have worked this out,

49:48.653 --> 49:49.618
you could have just kept your
mouth shut.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.320
Kept my mouth shut for what?

49:51.322 --> 49:53.389
For a man who doesn't respect
my friend?

49:54.959 --> 49:57.660
Where do you get that from?
Shit like that.

49:57.662 --> 49:58.961
Do you think it was appropriate

49:58.963 --> 50:01.697
for you to tell her brother
anything about her sex life?

50:01.699 --> 50:03.599
Okay, I get it, so you both to
get to put me on blast

50:03.601 --> 50:05.301
but I can't say anything about
her

50:05.303 --> 50:06.869
and that dude in my own bed?

50:06.871 --> 50:07.703
And you don't have to make up

50:07.705 --> 50:09.405
that shit about the threesome.

50:11.042 --> 50:13.109
The fuck did I make up? That
shit was gonna happen.

50:13.111 --> 50:15.811
Don't flatter yourself, Nate.
Please,

50:15.813 --> 50:17.613
she tells me everything.

50:17.615 --> 50:18.881
I already know you pop quicker

50:18.883 --> 50:20.983
than a bag of Orville
Redenbacher.

50:20.985 --> 50:22.451
There was never any chance of

50:22.453 --> 50:24.487
us hooking up, I can assure you.

50:24.489 --> 50:26.355
I seen you do a lot
worse than me.

50:27.225 --> 50:30.960
Yeah, but you'll never do
better than Melissa.

50:30.962 --> 50:32.294
You know what, you don't know
what's gonna happen,

50:32.296 --> 50:33.462
the whole fucking thing is
random,

50:33.464 --> 50:35.564
I could have hooked up with you
that night

50:35.566 --> 50:37.383
and then right now I'd be
breaking up with your ass.

50:37.384 --> 50:39.201
No no no, I would have dumped
you much sooner.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.637
No doubt, but that doesn't mean
you get to stand here

50:41.639 --> 50:44.206
and put a hex on my whole damn
future love life.

50:44.208 --> 50:47.243
For the record Nate, I don't
hate you.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.813
I don't think I was asking.

50:52.083 --> 50:56.318
I know somewhere deep in your
black twisted heart

50:56.320 --> 50:58.220
you actually tried to be good
to her.

51:00.091 --> 51:02.758
Oh, thanks, that's very
generous of you.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.560
I heard about the
good stuff too.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.795
Ooh nice.

51:06.597 --> 51:08.898
It's just this thing you guys
do now,

51:08.900 --> 51:11.934
where like, you want
to be kids forever

51:11.936 --> 51:16.238
and you wear T-shirts and go to
superhero movies

51:16.240 --> 51:19.408
on opening night instead of
watching the news

51:19.410 --> 51:22.278
or reading a book, it's just
really shitty

51:22.280 --> 51:24.013
for a woman who want to be with
real men.

51:24.015 --> 51:26.382
You saying I'm not a man?

51:26.384 --> 51:29.118
No, obviously you're a man,

51:29.120 --> 51:32.388
but what was your
father doing at 35?

51:32.390 --> 51:33.456
Or your grandfather?

51:34.392 --> 51:36.092
I bet I wouldn't even question
their manhood

51:36.094 --> 51:37.793
and I don't even know the dudes.

51:39.964 --> 51:43.933
Maybe you will meet a
woman as great as Melissa

51:45.069 --> 51:46.635
and maybe she'll meet
a guy that she loves

51:46.637 --> 51:47.970
as much as she loves you.

51:48.873 --> 51:51.107
Except he'll be a
man all the time,

51:51.109 --> 51:53.109
not just when it's convenient
for him.

51:54.412 --> 51:55.945
Shit, maybe you'll
both do better

51:55.947 --> 51:57.847
and stop sucking at everything.

52:00.585 --> 52:04.854
You're not a bad guy Nate,
you're just a bad boyfriend.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.094
I should probably go see if
they need help

52:12.096 --> 52:13.429
rearranging the van or
something.

52:13.431 --> 52:16.332
Yeah I doubt it and are you
gonna take a box?

52:16.334 --> 52:17.233
Nope.

52:28.412 --> 52:30.179
I don't think that's what these
bowls are for.

52:30.181 --> 52:32.515
Oh sorry.
It's okay,

52:32.517 --> 52:36.452
but let's eat this looks really
good, you did a great job.

52:36.454 --> 52:40.456
Thank you, I was trying to
impress you a little bit.

52:40.458 --> 52:45.361
So what should we do after
dinner?

52:46.531 --> 52:48.097
Oh, whatever you want to do.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.367
You don't have to work?

52:51.369 --> 52:53.502
No, this whole evening is just
for you.

52:54.372 --> 52:57.339
I mean I was thinking of
playing fewer parties anyway.

52:58.809 --> 53:02.344
Why, Nate, you might actually
convince me

53:02.346 --> 53:04.513
you're ready to settle down.

53:04.515 --> 53:05.414
Oh snap.

53:05.416 --> 53:09.652
What do you I have to
convince you like still?

53:09.654 --> 53:11.453
What do you think
all of this is?

53:11.455 --> 53:14.456
Now listen lady, we are not
married or anything,

53:14.458 --> 53:17.560
but we have bills together, our
credit is intertwined.

53:19.297 --> 53:21.230
I gave you my Netflix password.

53:22.533 --> 53:23.866
I don't just throw that shit
around.

53:23.868 --> 53:27.203
- No you right, you right.
- You're stuck with me.

53:27.205 --> 53:32.208
I'm like a tick. I'm gonna give
you Lyme disease of love.

53:32.210 --> 53:33.108
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

53:35.179 --> 53:38.681
This shit is serious.
Bonnie and Clyde,

53:38.683 --> 53:41.684
Mary J and Method Man.

53:41.686 --> 53:43.152
Ooh, that's some real love
right there.

53:43.154 --> 53:44.053
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

53:44.055 --> 53:45.588
- Okay.
- Can you handle that?

53:45.590 --> 53:46.889
- Mm-hmm.
- All right,

53:47.892 --> 53:49.124
Faith Evans and Biggie.

53:50.528 --> 53:51.660
Don't die.

53:51.662 --> 53:53.162
- Well, don't kill me.
- Ooh.

54:02.273 --> 54:03.839
You like rocking these huh?

54:03.841 --> 54:07.343
- You like them.
- Yes, I do like them,

54:07.345 --> 54:09.845
you look damn sexy in them.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.081
I just don't want you wearing
them to school

54:12.083 --> 54:16.018
because some big ass sixth
grader might make you his woman.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.186
Some of those sixth graders

54:17.188 --> 54:19.021
don't take no for an answer.

54:19.023 --> 54:20.589
I doubt you could take them.

54:21.892 --> 54:22.958
What?

54:22.960 --> 54:24.593
That's how it is,
you would just up

54:24.595 --> 54:27.263
and leave me for some kid.

54:27.265 --> 54:29.298
I mean, what can I say?

54:29.300 --> 54:31.066
I'm a vampire.

54:31.068 --> 54:32.334
They trust you.

54:35.406 --> 54:38.741
I didn't know that I was gonna
be with a vampire.

54:43.648 --> 54:44.546
Oh ho ho.

54:46.917 --> 54:48.150
Nice.

54:48.152 --> 54:50.352
I figured it was better than
your other backpack.

54:51.322 --> 54:54.657
It's great, thank you,
I love it. Here.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.395
Ah.

55:10.074 --> 55:13.342
Yeah, I saw you looking at
them, so...

55:15.579 --> 55:18.747
Yeah, I was looking at them
because--

55:18.749 --> 55:20.683
Wait, you don't like them?

55:20.685 --> 55:23.085
No, that's not true, they're
great.

55:24.155 --> 55:26.955
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

55:26.957 --> 55:29.792
- Ah!
- Ah, Happy New Year!

55:29.794 --> 55:32.961
- Happy new year.
- Thank you.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.196
Oh this is

55:36.467 --> 55:38.367
ew, no, where's the Hennessy,
where's the Hennessy?

55:38.369 --> 55:41.103
- No this is--
- Oh oh, why?

55:41.105 --> 55:42.004
What?

55:43.107 --> 55:44.306
You drink this shit?
- You gotta upgrade

55:44.308 --> 55:45.674
your palate.
- Uh uh.

55:52.016 --> 55:54.616
Classy.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.352
You don't know that at all.

55:56.354 --> 55:57.786
I think that's where your
energy comes from.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.688
That's the source of my energy?

55:59.690 --> 56:00.856
Yeah.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.291
It's all in the shoulder.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.201
What are you doing? Come on!

56:19.910 --> 56:21.410
We're almost done.

56:21.412 --> 56:24.146
I'm sorry, I just need a moment.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.583
You better not be changing your
mind.

56:27.585 --> 56:32.621
I'm not, I'm just I'm really
gonna miss this neighborhood.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.895
I swear I don't see what's so
special about it.

56:40.731 --> 56:43.365
It's historical, I ever tell you

56:43.367 --> 56:44.867
that Shirley Chisholm lived
around the corner?

56:44.869 --> 56:46.935
- Nah.
- And Laurence Fishburne.

56:48.005 --> 56:49.671
At least that's what one of the
neighbors told me.

56:49.673 --> 56:52.274
So you stuck on this place
because Cornbread, Earl and Me

56:52.276 --> 56:54.009
used to live out here?

56:54.011 --> 56:56.245
That's cool and all, but I
don't really care.

56:56.247 --> 56:58.280
Mamasita Reyes
wants her van back by six.

56:58.282 --> 56:59.381
I just want to appreciate

56:59.383 --> 57:01.216
the history of this
neighborhood.

57:01.218 --> 57:02.384
History is for people that

57:02.386 --> 57:04.153
are afraid to learn
something new.

57:05.623 --> 57:06.688
Enjoy your new place.

57:06.690 --> 57:10.058
A place I'm gonna go broke
paying rent in.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.910
I should have got a roommate.

57:11.911 --> 57:13.761
At least you saved a ton of
money living with this clown.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.265
I pay $450 a month.

57:16.267 --> 57:19.968
His mom charges him $900 a
month to live here?

57:19.970 --> 57:23.138
I know right, she's actually
being nice.

57:23.140 --> 57:24.807
That's a fact.

57:24.809 --> 57:27.476
Cheap rent in Brooklyn is a
powerful aphrodisiac.

57:28.412 --> 57:32.114
See there you go getting into
TMI territory again.

57:32.116 --> 57:34.950
I already learned enough about
you today.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.920
Come on, Cornbread, you help me
get this van back by six.

57:37.922 --> 57:39.221
I'll get you a soda pop.

57:51.168 --> 57:52.301
- Melissa.
- What?

57:53.103 --> 57:54.636
I'm sorry.

57:54.638 --> 57:57.639
I've owed you that
for some time.

57:58.676 --> 58:00.809
Well, today's not
about what I'm owed

58:00.811 --> 58:03.579
and besides, you don't even know

58:03.581 --> 58:05.414
what you're apologizing for.

58:05.416 --> 58:09.151
Well, not specifically but I
know that I hurt you

58:09.153 --> 58:13.222
I love you and I lost
sight of that and

58:16.694 --> 58:20.362
ya know we made mistakes, I
made mistakes, you made mistakes

58:20.364 --> 58:22.431
but we can still forgive each
other

58:22.433 --> 58:24.800
and I really need you to
forgive me right now.

58:24.802 --> 58:26.034
You have to believe me.

58:28.038 --> 58:29.338
I do believe you, Nate.

58:35.713 --> 58:36.678
We're a good match.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.147
We were once.

58:39.149 --> 58:41.717
When we were fighting, it just
came out of nowhere.

58:41.719 --> 58:44.152
First it was nowhere, then it
was everywhere.

58:44.154 --> 58:46.755
You remember when you first
moved here?

58:48.859 --> 58:50.192
How we used to shower together?

58:52.329 --> 58:55.631
I don't think I showered alone
at all that first year.

59:01.338 --> 59:02.170
How did that stop?

59:02.172 --> 59:04.206
- Nate.
- Please listen to me.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.141
Say what?

59:06.143 --> 59:08.810
I've given you every chance to
say anything and everything

59:08.812 --> 59:10.345
and you know what you've said?

59:10.347 --> 59:11.713
Nothing. Nothing.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.049
- I'm saying it now.
I-don't want to hear it now.

59:14.051 --> 59:15.817
What do you want me to do?

59:15.819 --> 59:16.885
What?
- Tell me what you

59:16.887 --> 59:19.087
want me to do.
- I want you to let me go.

59:20.858 --> 59:25.260
Please, just stay here.

59:25.262 --> 59:27.362
Why are you moving?

59:27.364 --> 59:31.800
Nate, we can't live together we
tried we failed.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.771
If you stayed, we can do this.

59:35.773 --> 59:38.006
That's your big motivational
speech?

59:40.411 --> 59:42.678
Nate, that's crazy and I've
spent enough time

59:42.680 --> 59:46.682
being crazy over you. And, Nate,

59:47.851 --> 59:50.485
you spent enough time being
crazy over me, too.

59:51.956 --> 59:53.188
We don't work.

59:54.425 --> 59:55.757
We do work, you're still here,

59:55.759 --> 59:58.126
you're still talking to me,
something's keeping you here.

59:58.128 --> 59:59.261
You're still holding my hand--

59:59.263 --> 01:00:03.198
Other than that.
There's still a chance.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.133
- Nate, there's no chance.
- Really?

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:09.871
- Even after this morning?
- Forget about this morning.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:12.441
No, this morning happened,
that's...

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:16.278
You don't feel anything when
I'm standing this close to you?

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.280
When I'm holding your hands
this way?

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:22.150
You don't remember this? You
don't feel anything?

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.254
Why? Stop. Stop!

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:30.926
- You kissed me this morning.
- Why are you doing this?

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.461
Maybe that's why you shouldn't
leave.

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:34.563
Maybe I should, if all we're
good for

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:36.298
is three minutes in the bedroom.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:39.768
Really?

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.470
We're not good for three
minutes in the bedroom.

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:45.073
We're good right here, these
moments.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.476
This isn't real?

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:49.144
This doesn't feel honest?

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.514
This... tell me something
honest right now.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:55.017
Tell me what you're feeling.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:57.052
- Nate I--
- No, just honesty, go.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:01.123
I'm gonna miss the floors here.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.024
Okay.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.694
- Is it my turn?
- Sure.

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:10.499
- I want to kiss you.
- Don't.

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:29.217
- I said don't.
- You don't feel anything?

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:30.252
I said don't.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.695
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:40.962
Crying like a baby with
shit-stained lollipop?

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:42.364
This dude.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.532
I don't know what I was
thinking.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:44.833
Yeah, I know what
you were thinking

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:46.368
you were thinking the
yellow-faced emoji

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.470
with the hearts for eyes,
that's what you were thinking.

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:49.304
That's what happens when you

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.006
take them goodbye fucks too far.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.140
Every time.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.710
Nate, all you young fellows
listen up,

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:57.012
see you all have watched too
much Oprah

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:59.014
and too many Denzel movies

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:02.117
and you think you
have to be oh sensitive.

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:04.920
What that get you?

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:09.124
On your face, on your face.

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.927
You two ever been caught up in
this kind of mess?

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:12.894
- No.
- No.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:19.067
Lying niggers, right there.
Both of you, both of you.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.171
You never made no mistakes?

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.506
You all perfect?

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.241
I'm on my face, but you're all
perfect right?

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.376
- Damn near it.
- Uh huh.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.178
He probably leaving out the part

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.948
where he was on his knees
begging.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.023
What did you do?

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:42.991
That's private.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.894
Wrong.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.463
You don't have anything private
concerning her anymore.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.398
He has some nerve.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.402
So what after some magical kiss
you're just supposed to say?

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.238
I did feel something Cora.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.207
Of course you felt something
you're in love.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.143
- I am.
- You're in love,

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:05.714
not captivity.
- You're a man, I guess.

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:09.050
I mean you have men friends,

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:10.886
if a guy like you can have
friends.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:13.789
Get on with it.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.893
See I hope that you have a lot
of friends

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.961
because you're gonna need them

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.230
to get off a woman like her.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:27.135
Okay Ted, uh, you know loving
your sister is great,

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.404
it's very noble and shit, but
you are making it

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:31.339
very creepy right now.

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:33.942
You know why you'll always be
lonely?

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:35.410
Tell me.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.545
Why am I leaving?

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.481
How was this any worse than
other fight we've had?

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.782
Do you really need a reason?

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:42.851
Yes, right now I do.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:45.187
Just one?
Just one.

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:48.490
You're selfish.
He's selfish.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:52.661
And a smart woman like her can
smell a selfish guy

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:54.496
like you coming a mile away.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:55.397
And you're not.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.867
You give too much.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.770
Believe me, I should know, I'm
selfish, too.

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:04.573
So then you're gonna be left
with the stupid girls

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.542
but you'll get bored with the
stupid girls,

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:10.745
because believe it or not,
you're a smart guy, Nate.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.682
But just because you've made
some bad decisions

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:16.284
doesn't mean you have to live
with them, literally.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:20.188
So without the dumb girls, what
else is there?

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:25.193
Your mother.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.494
Possibly.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:30.031
I mean a lot of guys do end up
with their momma.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.867
If you don't leave today,
you're gonna be counting down

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.869
the days until you have to
leave again.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:40.976
See look, don't be that guy.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.379
Not here.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.047
Be that guy with your friends,

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:51.753
but here, you don't have any
anymore.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.134
Woo!

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.006
What's up?
Who is Karen?

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.009
I don't know.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:15.577
You got her number in the pocket

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:18.213
of the jeans you worse last
night, but you don't know.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:22.417
What, you going through my
jeans now?

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.520
I am doing your laundry because

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:28.223
I'm a kind person and I love you

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:31.226
but I guess me being kind is
just me being a fool.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:32.060
I don't know who she is.

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:33.962
- Don't lie to me.
I-'m not lying.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.867
- I'm not.
- No, you ain't sleeping.

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:40.135
We talking about this.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:44.539

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.708

- What are we doing?
- What?

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:10.031
It's just that you seem okay

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.834
with the way things are going

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:14.502
and things are not good, Nate.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.138
Things suck.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.942
- You haven't noticed?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:22.010
What are we doing?

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:25.580
What we said we would.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:30.885
We're staying together. Being
together.

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:36.024
That's what this is about now,
a promise?

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:42.163
If we aren't making plans
together,

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.735
we're just wasting time
together.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.884
- So that's it?
- No, I mean

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:06.021
I don't want to waste anymore
of your time tonight, so...

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:07.188
That's all you have to say
about that?

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.957
I'm wasting your time--
You--

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:10.625
Just wasting your time so--
- So that's it, you don't

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:12.560
give a shit about it,
you don't care?

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:13.862
I give a shit, but you know

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:16.798
if we're wasting time, might as
well use the time to sleep.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.166
You're just gonna give up then?

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:19.200
Is that what this is?

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.853
You just giving up?

01:07:21.854 --> 01:07:24.505
- Is there more?
- I mean asked you a question.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:25.573
And I answered it.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.878
Okay, okay, okay good to know.

ain't worried about that.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:55.089
Nah, she's gone, I'm good, I'm
good, no.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.094
All right, no you were right,
you were right, but you know.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:04.132
It's my bed it's

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.536
I'm not worried about that,
though.

01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:12.040
Okay.

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:16.227
All right.

01:10:16.228 --> 01:10:19.279
No. I'm gonna be cool. I'm
gonna be totally... yeah.

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.883
All right all right bye.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.407
Can I get some money?

01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:31.091
Okay, no no I'm cool I'm cool.
All right all right.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.597
That's why you never buy a
chick kicks.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:38.433
She will definitely kick that
ass to the curb trust me.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:40.735
I hope you threw
them things away.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:41.836
Nah, actually I'm trying to
figure out

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.104
what to do with them.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:45.373
Man, but you can't keep them,
that's bad mojo.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.508
I hate to say it, man, but
Chester's right.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:48.776
Man, what are you all blind?

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:49.944
Even Stevie Wonder can see,

01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:52.780
this dude is not trying to give
up them sneakers.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.682
Hold up, when somebody leaves
something behind,

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:57.051
doesn't it mean that they
secretly want to come back?

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.386
Air Jesus are you for real?

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.922
Nate, stop the drugs.

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:05.593
Yo Nate, it means that they was
in such a rush to leave

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.463
that they didn't care what they
left behind.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.764
The point of no return in this
relationship, bruh,

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.366
was when Ted kicked your ass.

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:13.901
That was it, curtain call baby.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.970
Look man, she wasn't
in a rush okay?

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.238
She didn't like him at first,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.274
but you know what she wore them
all the time.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:20.541
Why because they meant
something to her,

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:23.978
because I meant something to
her you get that?

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.648
Yeah but why are you keeping
them, huh?

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.383
Is she gonna call you and you
gonna run over

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:30.952
with the sneaker ambulance or
something?

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.624
Oh Lord.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.676
This boy's gone.

01:11:38.677 --> 01:11:40.727
See that's exactly what I'm
talking about right there.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.130
What are you doing later, bruh?

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.931
Let's go out and get some
drinks, man.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:45.400
Get us some rebound pussy.

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:48.569
I'll let you wear my chain.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.574
I go with you.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:56.944
Fuck the chain and I take his
rebound pussy.

01:11:56.946 --> 01:12:00.014
Don't do it, Nate, don't do it
to yourself.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.784
Walking around all bitter with
your chest held tight.

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:04.752
Don't turn out like Chester.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.487
Fuck you.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.356
That was fucked up.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:09.190
Why do you gotta
call my name for?

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:10.091
What I done to you?

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:54.402
Hello.

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.303
Hi.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:57.305
Hi.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:02.510
Where are you?

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:04.979
In my room.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.215
- Where are you?
- At home.

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:10.151
Where else would I be?

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:13.488
Friday night, a BMCC orgy.

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:17.925
Oh, this is why you called me?

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:21.496
No.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.099
I'm bored.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.036
You miss me?

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:29.937
Yes.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:33.608
I miss you too.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.612
It's not like I'm gonna keep on
calling you or anything

01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:42.683
I just... I wanted to
hear your voice.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.320
No, it's okay.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.324
It's okay, I wanted to hear
your voice, too.

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:53.528
But you didn't call me?

01:13:57.467 --> 01:13:58.533
You sound surprised.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:13:59.534
I am.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.304
Well, I figured you just needed
your space

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:07.375
and even if you didn't, you
would just tell me you did.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.845
You have me all figured out.

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.182
If I had you all figured out,
I'd still have you.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:16.984
What are you doing?

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.120
What? Sleeping... in our bed.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.225
Oh wow.

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.126
What?

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.128
Wow.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.331
What?

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:33.000
I've been out the joint two
nights

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:35.937
and a brotha can already sleep
like a baby.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.605
You see why you foul?

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:38.940
I'm tired.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:41.742
Talking about loving somebody,
kill that noise.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:45.847
Oh man, I was awake the whole
night when you left.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:49.617
The whole night. You probably
went out clubbing with Cora.

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:50.585
You answered the phone like

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.487
I was calling about your Wi-Fi
bill.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:00.695
Nate?

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.366
Your mother says hi.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:06.601
Oh shit.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:08.803
Oh shit.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.171
Now who's foul?

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:14.308
I'm meeting her for dinner on
Wednesday.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:16.777
You know she really blames you
for messing this up.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.414
Shit you tell her to get her
ass in line then.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.552
Hate you.

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:26.220
You so wish you did.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:30.291
How's your new place?

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:34.195
It's nice, I like it.

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:41.903
I gotta get used to it, though,
you know.

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:43.538
It was kind of scary last night.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:48.809
Weird new noises, the bed was
cold.

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.545
I knew I was just a bed warmer.

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:55.216
I'm wearing those thick socks
you like.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.918
Okay, now I only like those
socks

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.086
when you wear nothin' but a
T-shirt with them,

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.088
the effect gets lost when you
put on

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:03.691
those bulky pajamas of yours.
So which one was it?

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.893
The T-shirt or the bulky
pajamas?

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:07.562
Wouldn't you like to know?
- I'd like to know

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:08.729
what you're wearing now.

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:11.499
I'm definitely not
telling you that.

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:13.367
- It's the T-shirt.
- Shut up.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:14.201
It's the T-shirt

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.770
and those flannel short shorts,

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.738
got your legs out, oh snap!

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.541
It is not it's the gray baggy
sweatpants.

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:24.412
Stop lying you wear those
sweatpants on laundry day

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:27.214
or if it's cold out or you're
gonna take

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.751
the garbage out to front, but
don't mess with me,

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:31.852
that's not no bed shit.

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:35.456
You got on those flannel boxers
right now.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:36.524
You're impossible.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:42.096
- I left my sneakers.
- You left your sneakers here.

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:48.235
I mean I could just put them in
the mail for you.

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:49.704
I'm not giving you my address.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:50.638
Okay fine.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.275
I could come pick them up.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:58.413
I don't have to stay long.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:01.182
No no no you can just duck in
and out.

01:17:02.318 --> 01:17:03.985
Yeah.
- I mean unless

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:09.056
you wanted to get lunch or
something like that.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:12.026
Oh yeah.

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.231
Would you want to get lunch?

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.300
That or you know I could just
meet you

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.735
somewhere with the kicks?

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:22.937
Oh no no no, don't go out of
your way.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:24.305
- I can come over.
- Yeah?

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.240
- Yeah.
- Do you want to

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.978
I don't know, like tomorrow at
noon?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:35.182
- Yeah, that works.
- All right.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.319
Okay.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:42.990
