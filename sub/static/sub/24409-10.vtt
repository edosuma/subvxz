00:16.103 --> 00:17.068
Maybe it's the girls?

Oh, my God, I'm nervous.

Why the  are you here?

01:37.241 --> 01:38.344
What the ?

01:38.413 --> 01:40.517
I'm looking
at the devil herself.

01:40.586 --> 01:41.517
Why are you here?

01:41.586 --> 01:43.413
What do you mean why?

01:43.482 --> 01:46.241
Angelina chose
to leave us twice.

Yo, guys, I'm out.

01:48.172 --> 01:49.758
Peace out, fake people!

01:49.827 --> 01:50.965
She talks .

01:51.034 --> 01:52.965
It's always  me
in this house, right?

01:53.034 --> 01:54.931
I talk  about everyone
in this  house!

01:55.000 --> 01:57.517
You just don't care,
like, seriously.

01:57.586 --> 01:58.896
I have a very bad temper.

01:58.965 --> 02:01.931
Ron, take my
upstairs right now.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.896
So the only thing that I can do
is walk away from the situation

02:05.965 --> 02:08.448
and Namaste
the  out of my room.

02:08.517 --> 02:10.344
Awk-- Awkward!

02:10.413 --> 02:13.448
Awkward! Awkward?It's not awkward,
come on.

02:13.517 --> 02:15.068

02:23.655 --> 02:25.310
Well, those are my roommates.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.551
Snooki handled it well.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.068
Snooki's actually like,
really nice and cool.

02:28.137 --> 02:29.862
Yeah, she is.Yeah, she is.

02:29.931 --> 02:32.413
Why!

02:32.482 --> 02:34.827
[overlapping shouting,
laughing]

02:34.896 --> 02:36.275
Why did you do this?

02:36.344 --> 02:37.379
Why did this happen?

02:37.448 --> 02:39.000
I love you!

02:39.068 --> 02:40.931
I don't think
Jenni's too happy.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.413
They're a little drunk,
bear with them.

02:43.482 --> 02:45.482
Awk-- Awkward!

02:45.551 --> 02:47.413
Oh, jeez.

02:47.482 --> 02:49.482
The girls are, like, shocked.
I don't know what's

02:49.551 --> 02:52.241
going happen, but I do know
I'm the prank war champion!

02:52.310 --> 02:53.965
Can only imagine what's
being said right now.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.344
She's staying here?
She's staying here.

02:55.413 --> 02:56.862
Where is she staying?

02:56.931 --> 02:58.137
We're gonna put the mattress
in your room.

02:58.206 --> 02:59.206
No, you kill yourself.

02:59.275 --> 03:00.551
I'm gonna cut your
balls off.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.827
She's not a nice girl.

03:02.896 --> 03:04.862
No, she is nice.
She's not bad.

03:04.931 --> 03:06.413
Oh, she's not
bad to you.

03:06.482 --> 03:09.551
Ron all of a sudden has
a conscience. Who are you?

03:09.620 --> 03:12.000
Princess Diana?

03:12.068 --> 03:13.793
See, Mike? You handled it
way better than the girls.

03:13.862 --> 03:15.448
Right? New man.

03:15.517 --> 03:18.344
Ronnie's with the girls.
Should we go see?

03:18.413 --> 03:21.482
Oh, my God.Go up to your room.

03:21.551 --> 03:22.862
Unpack a little bit.

03:24.551 --> 03:26.379
The boys kept telling me,
"No, the girls will be fine.

03:26.448 --> 03:28.172
The girls will be fine,
they'll be fine."

03:28.241 --> 03:31.137

I'm just thinking, mmm...

03:31.206 --> 03:33.931
I don't know about that.
is gonna do down.

03:38.172 --> 03:39.448
Don't look at me.Delvecchio!You invited her!

03:39.517 --> 03:40.655
Great prank, Pauly.

03:40.724 --> 03:42.172
It wasn't me.Who was it?

03:43.827 --> 03:46.344
Vinny Guadagnino!It wasn't me.

03:46.413 --> 03:48.448
Seriously, where is this
bitch sleeping?

03:48.517 --> 03:49.586
In the smush room.

03:49.655 --> 03:51.620
She's sleeping
in the smush room.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.482
She literally just
told a story about me,

03:53.551 --> 03:55.793
like, three months ago
saying how ugly I was.

03:55.862 --> 03:59.000
Wow, you should go talk
to her about that.

03:59.068 --> 04:00.586
I don't want to.

04:00.655 --> 04:02.655
My experience with Angelina:

04:02.724 --> 04:05.931
She's an ,
she's mean, she's immature...

04:06.000 --> 04:10.172
All of you's in this house
are  fake!

04:10.241 --> 04:13.482
Bring it on, bitch!

04:13.551 --> 04:16.413
Three months before I even
came here, she did a story

04:16.482 --> 04:19.689
about me saying
that I was, like, an ugly.

04:19.758 --> 04:22.931
I don't hold grudges,
but when I look at her,

04:23.000 --> 04:24.896
I'm, like,
you are still a snake.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.034

Hi, Angelina.Oh, hi, bitch.

04:28.793 --> 04:30.379
Hey.Hey.

04:30.448 --> 04:33.896
So I'm just gonna ask

Why the  are you here?

04:35.965 --> 04:39.931

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000

to make amends.

04:43.275 --> 04:44.793
Angelina has never
reached out to me

04:44.862 --> 04:46.310
in eight years,
not once.

04:46.379 --> 04:48.103
She has not tried
to say I'm sorry.

04:48.172 --> 04:50.862
The last time that I heard
of you, you were talking

04:50.931 --> 04:52.724
to the tabloids saying
how ugly I was.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.241
And I thought we were,
like, over that.That's not true.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.517
You did quotes.
You did quotes.

04:56.586 --> 04:58.724
No, I did not say that--
that your lips are "ugly."

05:00.206 --> 05:01.655
She said lips.

05:01.724 --> 05:03.172
You didn't give me-- I haven't
talked to you in so long.

05:03.241 --> 05:05.310
I didn't go to tabloids.
They actually asked me--

05:05.379 --> 05:07.379
Girl, just be real and then
we'll be cool, just be real.

05:07.448 --> 05:09.379
Straight up, that's--
that's the truth.

05:09.448 --> 05:10.965
I don't really know the girl.

05:11.034 --> 05:14.344
And, honestly, Angelina leaving
was totally awesome for me

05:14.413 --> 05:16.000
because then I got to come in

05:16.068 --> 05:18.620
and be part
of this awesome family.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.137
But you don't have the bond
that we all have.

05:20.206 --> 05:21.551
Like, why don't-- Why aren't
you not getting that?

05:21.620 --> 05:23.310
You guys could make
me have that bond.

05:23.379 --> 05:25.034
No, bitch! No!No, we don't want it.

05:25.103 --> 05:26.103
It's been eight years
since we've seen you!

05:26.172 --> 05:27.206
No, thank you!

05:27.275 --> 05:28.965
No, thank you! No!

Jenni and Nicole are furious.

05:31.310 --> 05:34.068
This is, like, pent up
aggression 'cause the last time

05:34.137 --> 05:37.448
we left Angelina in Miami,
no one left on good terms.

05:37.517 --> 05:39.206
I mean, I could get slapped in
the face again.

05:39.275 --> 05:42.034
I bet you you won't make it
a  week in this house

05:42.103 --> 05:44.034
because you are not a part
of our  family.

05:44.103 --> 05:46.103
End of the day,
you have not experienced

05:46.172 --> 05:48.827
what we all have
experienced together.

05:50.379 --> 05:51.896
You had so long to
be in our family,

05:51.965 --> 05:53.827
and now all of a sudden
you wanna come in?

05:53.896 --> 05:55.620
You could've
contacted all of us

05:55.689 --> 05:57.413
and said,
"Listen, I wanna be friends."

05:57.482 --> 06:00.172
It's just too late
to enter our family.

06:00.241 --> 06:03.103
Not once did you try to make
amends in eight  years.

06:03.172 --> 06:04.586
How am I gonna
make amends to you years!

06:04.655 --> 06:05.758
Do I have your number?

06:05.827 --> 06:07.172
I didn't have
you blocked, bitch.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.413
I don't have your number.I didn't have you blocked.

06:08.482 --> 06:09.793
I don't have her number.You never Twittered me.

06:09.862 --> 06:11.448
I definitely wanna
show people that

06:11.517 --> 06:13.931
I'm not this crazy girl,
I've grown up a lot.

This is the chance to redeem
myself, that's why I'm here.

06:16.448 --> 06:18.586
You blocked me on every
social media.

06:18.655 --> 06:19.827
I did--
You blocked me,
actually!

06:19.896 --> 06:21.034
I didn't block you.Never did.

06:21.103 --> 06:25.000
You wanna come somewhere
eight years later?

06:25.068 --> 06:26.931
Right now, we are watching

06:27.000 --> 06:29.517

06:29.586 --> 06:33.068

You have no  idea
what this-- what this took.

of group chat.

06:38.724 --> 06:40.482

06:40.551 --> 06:43.965
Oh, no! JWoww is ripping
the hippo's head off!

06:44.034 --> 06:45.517
You guys should be like, "You
know what, let me try to give

06:45.586 --> 06:47.793
this girl a shot because
we don't really know her."

06:47.862 --> 06:50.620
No, I know you.
You're not a nice person.

06:50.689 --> 06:53.172
Oh, my God! Nicole is
her vagina!

06:53.241 --> 06:54.793
What
I mean, wait!

06:54.862 --> 06:57.379
Well, everybody's just
getting crazy.

06:57.448 --> 06:59.931
Deena, relax, because you
haven't even been in this house

07:00.000 --> 07:02.034

I'm not even-- Listen,
I'm not even gonna get
engaged in this .

07:04.689 --> 07:06.206
However long you stay,
I just wanna know

07:06.275 --> 07:07.586
so Nicole can pack your bags.

07:07.655 --> 07:09.827
She's not packing my bags.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.655
Why the
are you here?

07:11.724 --> 07:13.344
Why are you here?

07:13.413 --> 07:15.275
You're here because
you're a  chew toy.

07:15.344 --> 07:18.034
No, I'm not.Watch.

07:18.103 --> 07:19.827

step by step.

that brought Angelina
to this house,

36:10.586 --> 36:12.137
I think it's only right that
I start the discussion

36:12.206 --> 36:14.068
of how to get her out.

36:14.137 --> 36:15.241
Okay, so I called this
family meeting today

36:15.310 --> 36:18.241
because, um,
prank war champion

36:18.310 --> 36:21.413
was such a good prank that I
actually pranked myself.

36:21.482 --> 36:23.793
I didn't think about this.
She's-- She's still here.

36:23.862 --> 36:25.310
Yeah, now what?

36:25.379 --> 36:26.517
Is she staying?
Is she going?

36:26.586 --> 36:28.965
Well, what's good is
we got to see

36:29.034 --> 36:31.551
what she's here for and--
and least now we know

36:31.620 --> 36:33.137
where her head is at.

36:33.206 --> 36:35.206
But she shouldn't be

For the rest
of it, no.

36:36.931 --> 36:39.137
It was great to
have her come out
and speak her mind.

36:39.206 --> 36:41.551
Got to know her
a little bit.Exactly, you know,

36:41.620 --> 36:43.241
which we never gave her,
you know, a chance before.

36:43.310 --> 36:45.206
I think we gotta break it
to her and let her know

36:45.275 --> 36:47.655
that the way that we
started this thing,
with just us here--

36:47.724 --> 36:49.103
We have to
end it that way.

36:49.172 --> 36:50.275

home from here,

we'll see if she
really means it.

Yeah, we'll see if it's
still the same after this.

36:57.379 --> 36:58.344
Exactly. Agreed.

36:58.413 --> 36:59.896
So how are we doing that?

36:59.965 --> 37:01.551
We should make
a toast to her.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.000
We're gonna, like,
make an effort

37:03.068 --> 37:04.517

friends with us.

can break the news.
