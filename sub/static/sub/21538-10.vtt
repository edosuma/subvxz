00:06.206 --> 00:08.174
MAKES A LISTING VIDEO

00:08.208 --> 00:11.211
AND SPENDS TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS ON IT EXCEPT FOR ME.

00:11.244 --> 00:14.347

IS ON THE MARKET NOW!

00:14.381 --> 00:16.449

00:22.756 --> 00:24.691

HOW A NEW DEVELOPMENT WORKS.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.926
I WANT TO MOLD HIM
AND BUILD A LITTLE MINI FREDRIK.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.029
- I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS,
BUT I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT

00:29.062 --> 00:30.730
YOUR REAL INTENTION.
- I'M TRYIN' TO HELP YOU.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.533
- YOU'RE NOT TRYIN' TO HELP ME.
YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

00:33.566 --> 00:36.703
[upbeat music]

00:36.736 --> 00:41.541
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.911
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:44.944 --> 00:46.046
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:46.079 --> 00:48.415
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.984
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.118
WAH!

00:52.152 --> 00:53.653
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.821
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

00:54.854 --> 00:55.955
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:55.989 --> 00:57.157
- YOU'RE NOT TRYIN' TO HELP ME.
- WHAT?

00:57.190 --> 00:58.158
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

00:58.191 --> 01:02.462
* *

01:10.470 --> 01:13.606
- MY NEW LISTING IN BROOKLYN
HAS BEEN INTERESTING.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.674
- HELLO.
- HI, JEANNE.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.176
THE SELLER, JEANNE,
BROUGHT ME IN

01:16.209 --> 01:18.545
TO REPRESENT HER
IN THE SALE OF HER TOWNHOUSE...

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
WOW, I LOVE IT.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.849
AND POSSIBLY,
HER FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.518
I HAD A LOT OF BUYERS
AND FAMILIES OF MY OPEN HOUSE.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.287
THE RESPONSE
WAS OVERWHELMINGLY GREAT...

01:27.320 --> 01:28.788
- OOH, NICE KITCHEN.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.291
- BUT I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY BITES YET.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.363
- OH. FULL HOUSE.
- OH, MY GOSH.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.131
- GET A LOAD OF THIS.
- HEY.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.265
- DO YOU LIKE THIS?
DO YOU LIKE THIS?

01:39.299 --> 01:40.266
- WHAT'S WITH THE GETUP?

01:40.300 --> 01:41.634
- GUESS, GUESS,
GUESS NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.770
GUESS NEIGHBORHOOD.
- SAN FRANCISCO?

01:43.803 --> 01:46.639
- NO, IT'S BROOKLYN, PEOPLE.
LET ME TELL YOU.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.541
YES, I'M CRAZY.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.543
YES, I'M METHOD
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE.

01:50.577 --> 01:54.447
I BELIEVE
IN REALLY FOCUSING IN.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.949
ISN'T THIS WHAT
A BROOKLYN HIPSTER LOOKS LIKE?

01:55.982 --> 01:57.150
- AMAZING.
- HAVE YOU EVER

01:57.183 --> 01:59.919
BEEN TO BROOKLYN?
- [laughs]

01:59.953 --> 02:01.788
- DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.891
I BROUGHT BROOKLYN
VEGAN DOUGHNUTS.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.061
- [gasps] WOW.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.163
- DO WE HAVE ANY OFFERS?
NO.

02:10.196 --> 02:14.934
INTEREST DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
WITHOUT A REAL OFFER,

02:14.968 --> 02:17.170
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY

02:17.203 --> 02:20.106
IS SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.175
I DID SOME RESEARCH.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.744
THIS IS A REPORT
ON THE TOWNHOUSE MARKET

02:24.778 --> 02:26.179
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.182
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE PRICE
OF A TOWNHOME OUR SIZE? WHAT?

02:29.215 --> 02:32.085
all: 11 MILLION.
- 11.3, LET ME REMIND YOU.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.888
IT'S EXPENSIVE THERE.
PEOPLE ARE PRICED OUT.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.625
WE'RE PRICED IN BROOKLYN
LESS THAN HALF

02:38.658 --> 02:41.094
FOR THE SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE,
ACTUALLY, MORE SQUARE FEET.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.196
WE NEED TO BRING IN
THE MANHATTANITE.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.799
THE AMENITIES OF PARK SLOPE
IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR.

02:45.832 --> 02:46.966
YOU HAVE THE PARKS.
YOU HAVE THE RESTAURANTS.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.102
YOU HAVE THE SCHOOLS.
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.439
THIS GAP RIGHT HERE,
UPPER WEST SIDE AND PARK SLOPE,

02:52.472 --> 02:53.907
I'M GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.742
YOU TAKE THE COMPS
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.143
YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER.
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

02:57.177 --> 02:58.645
IT FEELS INEXPENSIVE.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.879
- VERY SMART.
- THANK YOU,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.047
YOU'RE GETTING
A RAISE.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.383
GIVE HIM A DOUGHNUT.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.433
- WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- IT'S SATURDAY.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.103
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GO OUT A LITTLE BIT.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.538
- CAN'T WE JUST MAKE BABIES AND,
LIKE, WATCH A MOVIE LATER?

03:25.572 --> 03:29.075
THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD
BETWEEN ME AND EMILIA RECENTLY.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.678
SHE DECIDED
THAT SHE NEEDED MORE FROM ME,

03:31.711 --> 03:34.848
SO I DECIDED TO TELL HER THINGS
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.950
I'M MUCH MEANER
THAN I USED TO BE.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.218
- YOU'RE MUCH MEANER
THAN YOU USED TO BE?

03:38.251 --> 03:40.754
- NOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS
PROBABLY WEIRD TO HEAR,

03:40.787 --> 03:43.189
BUT IT'S A BIG THING FOR ME.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.924
AND I'M TRYING
TO BE AROUND MORE.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.359
I STILL HAVE TO WORK
ALL THE TIME,

03:46.393 --> 03:49.095
INCLUDING THE WEEKENDS,
BUT WHEN I DO,

03:49.095 --> 03:51.631
I'M TRYING TO WORK FROM HOME
SO I CAN SEE HER MORE.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.933
- WHAT YOU DOING?
- I GOT THIS GUY,

03:53.967 --> 03:55.769
HE WANTS, LIKE,
A BIG FOUR-BEDROOM

03:55.802 --> 03:58.772
IN LINCOLN PLAZA AREA,

03:58.805 --> 04:00.774
AND I'VE LITERALLY SHOWN HIM,
LIKE, EVERYTHING.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.342
LIKE, EVERYTHING.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.145
AND 30 LINCOLN PLAZA WOULD BE
AWESOME, BUT THERE'S NOTHING.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.548
I HAVE A BUYER
WITH NOTHING TO SELL TO HIM

04:08.581 --> 04:11.651
BECAUSE INVENTORY IS SO LOW,
BUT I KNOW THAT 30 LINCOLN PLAZA

04:11.685 --> 04:13.586
HAS OFF-MARKET INVENTORY.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.055
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

04:15.055 --> 04:19.159
- MY BIGGEST CONTACT THERE
IS LUIS,

04:19.192 --> 04:21.394
AND...

04:21.428 --> 04:24.064
- OKAY.
- LUIS AND I

04:24.064 --> 04:26.766
ARE NOT REALLY, LIKE,
ON THE SAME PAGE AT THE MOMENT.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.901
- WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.602
- YOU ARE NOT GONNA
[bleep] THIS UP FOR ME.

04:29.636 --> 04:30.870
- I'M READY FOR
YOU TO [bleep] IT UP.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.506
YOU WANT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH?

04:33.540 --> 04:36.276
- WOW.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.511
- YEAH. SO MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.580
- HOW DID IT EVEN
REACH THAT POINT?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.916
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS STUPID.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.118
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
BEFORE YOU CAME TO NEW YORK,

04:45.151 --> 04:47.087
BEFORE YOU GOT
INTO REAL ESTATE?

04:47.087 --> 04:49.522
- NO. THAT GUY'S DEAD.
I KILLED HIM.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.558
I STUCK HIM--
HE'S IN A BOX UNDER MY BED.

04:51.591 --> 04:52.959
DON'T GO UNDER THERE.
HE'S GONNA COME OUT,

04:52.992 --> 04:54.861
HE'S GONNA BE SUPER FUNNY.
HE'S CUTE.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.097
HE'S BIGGER 'CAUSE HE HAD
MORE TIME TO WORK OUT.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.532
- [laughs]
- HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL, THOUGH.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.901
I MEAN, I WASN'T ALWAYS
LIKE THIS, BUT IT'S THE ONLY--

05:01.935 --> 05:04.371
IT'S--LISTEN, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED IN THE BUSINESS,

05:04.404 --> 05:07.674
I WANTED TO BE THE NICE GUY,
BUT THAT GUY DOESN'T WIN.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.242
WHEN LOOK OF THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

05:09.275 --> 05:12.412
IN THE INDUSTRY, AND THEY'RE--
I MEAN, THEY'RE PEOPLE

05:12.445 --> 05:15.815
WHO WILL--
THEY'LL KILL TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.384
- BUT THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER WAY.

05:17.417 --> 05:21.221
YOU'RE LETTING THIS CITY
JUST CHANGE YOU.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.856
- I DON'T WANT TO. I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE MEAN GUY.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.257
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE [bleep].

05:24.290 --> 05:28.395
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO
FIGURE OUT, LIKE, THE BALANCE.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.231
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO I HAVEN'T
SEEN IN, LIKE, FIVE YEARS,

05:31.264 --> 05:32.532
RIGHT, OR PEOPLE I KNEW
IN COLLEGE,

05:32.565 --> 05:35.902
OR PEOPLE I KNEW IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT I SEE NOW,

05:35.935 --> 05:40.073
YOU KNOW, WILL TELL ME, LIKE,
"OH, YOU'RE REALLY DIFFERENT."

05:40.073 --> 05:44.778
AND WHAT THEY MEAN ISN'T,
LIKE, "YOUR HAIR IS GRAYER."

05:44.811 --> 05:48.181
IT'S, "WOW, YOU REALLY KIND OF
BECAME AN [bleep]."

05:48.214 --> 05:52.719
- IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD
TO GO BACK

05:52.752 --> 05:56.856
WHEN YOU'VE GOTTEN
SO USED TO BEING THIS PERSON.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.258
- I DON'T KNOW.
- AND I WOULD HATE

05:58.291 --> 06:01.061
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.463
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT AT SOME POINT,

06:03.496 --> 06:06.900
YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE
WILL START TO SUFFER,

06:06.933 --> 06:09.669
AND THAT SOMEHOW,
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS OUT

06:09.703 --> 06:12.038
ON MOMENTS THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.474
- MAYBE.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.743
- SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TRY AND REACH OUT TO HIM?

06:16.776 --> 06:20.180
- TO LUIS?
- YES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

06:25.051 --> 06:28.355
- [sighs] OKAY.
- OKAY.

06:36.062 --> 06:41.735
[line ringing]

06:41.768 --> 06:42.936
- [automated voice]
YOUR CALL HAS BEEN FOR--

06:44.104 --> 06:47.507
- LUIS ISN'T ANSWERING.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.376
I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT THEY CALL KARMA.

07:00.020 --> 07:04.024
[indistinct chatter]

07:04.024 --> 07:05.025
- HI!

07:05.025 --> 07:06.192
- HELLO.
- HI.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.028
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO BROOKLYN.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.630
JEANNE HIRED ME BECAUSE
I'M THE TOP BROKER IN MANHATTAN,

07:10.663 --> 07:13.133
RIGHT?
SO I NEED TO FETCH PEOPLE

07:13.166 --> 07:15.869
FROM MANHATTAN, EDUCATE THEM
ON ALL THE GOOD THINGS

07:15.902 --> 07:17.303
HAPPENING IN BROOKLYN
RIGHT NOW,

07:17.337 --> 07:18.538
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO TODAY.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.675
COME WITH ME.
COME AND LOOK AT THE HOUSE.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.045
TAKE A STEP BACK INTO HISTORY.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.480
- DID THEY PRESERVE IT,
OR WAS IT RENOVATED?

07:27.514 --> 07:28.481
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF BOTH.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.217
A LOT OF IT
IS ORIGINAL DETAILS.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.652
- HOW DOES THIS AREA COMPARE
TO MANHATTAN?

07:32.686 --> 07:35.588
- THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS UPPER WEST SIDE, RIGHT?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.924
IT'S TREE-LINED.
IT'S QUIET.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.926
LOTS OF FAMILIES.
YOU HAVE PARKS.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.262
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS,
BUT YOU'RE GETTING

07:42.295 --> 07:46.066
A BETTER, BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
WITH MORE LIGHT

07:46.066 --> 07:47.367
ON A MORE BEAUTIFUL STREET.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.235
AND THEN YOU'RE PAYING,
WHAT, 1/3 OF THE PRICE?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.171
UNDER 10 MILLION, NEVER.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.273
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
NEGATIVE. CAN YOU?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.075
- IT'S 45 MINUTES
FROM UPPER EAST SIDE.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.844
- THAT'S KIND OF FAR.
- FAR?

07:57.877 --> 08:01.381
HERE WE GO.
THE BIG, BIG, DARK CLOUD,

08:01.414 --> 08:04.217
THE CONCERN PEOPLE HAVE
ABOUT THE DISTANCE TO MANHATTAN.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.287
- I GUESS THE ONLY RESERVATIONS
I WOULD HAVE ABOUT BROOKLYN

08:07.320 --> 08:08.688
IS PROBABLY WORK TRAVEL.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.824
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE IN PARK SLOPE

08:10.857 --> 08:13.693
BECAUSE MANHATTAN
IS SO DISCONNECTED FROM ME.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.795
YOU HAVE FOUR SECONDS
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.564
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU
TO GET HERE FROM MANHATTAN?

08:17.597 --> 08:18.832
[snapping fingers]
- 25 MINUTES.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.833
- 15 IN A CAB.
- [laughs]

08:19.866 --> 08:21.167
- OH, I LIKE THAT, 15.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.470
IT LITERALLY TOOK ME,
I WOULD SAY, 16 MINUTES.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.039
I SHOT DOWN THE WEST SIDE
HIGHWAY INTO THE TUNNEL.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.807
[squish]
DOONK, RIGHT HERE.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.510
15 MINUTES FROM DOWNTOWN
FOR HALF THE PRICE,

08:30.543 --> 08:31.644
SO, LIKE, THINK ABOUT THAT.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.679
- A LOT MORE FREE MONEY
OVER HERE.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.847
- YEAH.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.649
- I FEEL IT WAS
A VERY SUCCESSFUL OPEN HOUSE,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.551
AND HOPEFULLY,
THEY CAN SEE BROOKLYN

08:38.585 --> 08:39.919
IN DIFFERENT LIGHT,
I GUESS.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.755
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.323
YOU GONNA CALL YOUR CLIENTS.
- DEFINITELY.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.891
- CONVINCE THEM.
ARE YOU EXCITED?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.326
I WANT TO HEAR THE EXCITEMENT.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.761
all: BROOKLYN!

08:47.794 --> 08:49.462
- WHOO!
- WHOO!

08:55.902 --> 08:58.171
- SO WE'RE GONNA START
WITH SOME BASIC JUMPING JACKS

08:58.204 --> 08:59.172
UP AND DOWN.
GET THE BLOOD FLOWING.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.273
- ALL RIGHT.

09:00.306 --> 09:04.010
- THERE WE GO,
TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN--

09:04.010 --> 09:05.612
- I'M STILL VERY PISSED OFF
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

09:05.645 --> 09:07.013
BETWEEN ME AND FREDRIK,
AND I'M DOING

09:07.047 --> 09:09.282
EVERYTHING THAT I CAN
TO PUT BEHIND ME.

09:09.315 --> 09:12.118
- ONE, TWO, THREE,
BANG IT OUT. FOUR.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.119
COME ON, KEEP IT GOING.
- [grunts]

09:13.153 --> 09:15.021
[phone ringing]
ONE SECOND. SORRY.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.156
- DUDE, NO CELL PHONES
WHEN WE'RE TRAINING.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.024
- SORRY, BRO.
YOU KNOW, BUSINESS.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.025
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TAKE IT.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.160
- YEAH, I GOTTA TAKE
THIS ONE.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.795
THIS GUY'S BEEN CALLING ME
FOR AGES.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.396
RYAN?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:23.430 --> 09:25.331
AFTER WHAT I JUST WENT THROUGH
WITH FREDRIK,

09:25.365 --> 09:27.300
I DO NOT NEED
MORE NEGATIVE STUFF IN MY LIFE.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.303
RYAN SERHANT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- HI, LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.205
- YOU KEEP CALLING,
SO WHAT'S UP?

09:33.940 --> 09:36.676
YOUR MOST FAVORITE GUY
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW...

09:39.913 --> 09:42.582
I'D LIKE TO MEET
SO WE CAN DISCUSS IN PERSON.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.392
- I'M NO LONGER WORKING
WITH 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.828
SOMETIMES, GOOD RESULTS
TAKE TIME TILL THAT RIGHT NUMBER

09:54.861 --> 09:58.264
COMES ALONG, AND I--
- LUIS, THE TIMING IS UP.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.134
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

10:05.472 --> 10:09.542
CAN YOU GIVE ME
JUST FIVE MINUTES IN PERSON?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.316
- OKAY, FIVE MINUTES.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.286
- I--

10:20.320 --> 10:22.188
- [bleep] PIECE OF [bleep].
- GOOD?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.189
- I'M GOOD.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.025
- OKAY.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.292
- HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO
TO THIS GUY.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.594
AH!

10:28.628 --> 10:29.763
TELL ME WHAT
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE FOR.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.197
- I HAVE A BUYER
FOR 30 LINCOLN,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.599
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT, YOU CAN GO.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.933
- I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU WASTE MY TIME,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.001
I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR FACE.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.885
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT RYAN IS UP TO

10:51.918 --> 10:53.319
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I SEE THIS GUY,

10:53.353 --> 10:55.221
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO SABOTAGE MY CAREER,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.490
AND I WILL NEVER
LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:57.524 --> 11:01.127
RYAN. WHAT'S UP?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.929
GOING INTO THIS,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT LUIS HAD BEEN

11:02.962 --> 11:04.497
LET GO FROM 30 LINCOLN.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.266
DO YOU WANT A DRINK?
- I DON'T WANT A DRINK.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.068
- ARE YOU SURE?
THIS IS GOOD.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.070
IF I'D KNOWN THAT, I MEAN,
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD'VE

11:10.070 --> 11:13.506
GONE TO THE DEVELOPER DIRECTLY,
BUT THE LAST TIME I SAW LUIS,

11:13.540 --> 11:16.876
I KIND OF CAUSED A SCENE
AT HIS OPEN HOUSE,

11:16.910 --> 11:20.914
AND SO IF THIS IS ONE WAY
TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM FOR THAT,

11:20.947 --> 11:22.215
THEN SO BE IT.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.220
- TELL ME WHAT
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE FOR.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.356
- SO I HAVE A--
SO I HAVE A BUYER.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.191
HE'S FROM THE MIDWEST.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.960
BUDGET IS ANYWHERE
UP TO $6 MILLION.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.297
HE'D BE GOOD FOR 30 LINCOLN,
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL,

11:37.330 --> 11:40.467
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU, AND
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ALONE.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.869
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, YOU CAN GO,

11:42.902 --> 11:46.873
AND I'LL SIT HERE AND DRINK.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.109
- I'M SORRY, I JUST HAVE
A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT.

11:49.142 --> 11:53.747
I MEAN, JUST BASED ON
WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.449
YOU DON'T--YOU KNOW
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.053
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
THROUGH THE SALES OFFICE.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.323
I WANT TO WORK JUST WITH YOU.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.391
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.059
- I WANT TO CLEAR THE AIR
WITH YOU.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.661
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL
IN THIS BUSINESS,

12:08.695 --> 12:10.330
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN KARMA

12:10.363 --> 12:11.664
AND YOU HAVE TO WORK WELL
WITH OTHERS,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.667
AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU AND I
HAVE BOTH HAD

12:13.700 --> 12:15.235
SOME DIFFERENCES
HERE AND THERE--

12:15.268 --> 12:16.736
- BUT YOU KNOW WHY.
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.937
I'M AN [bleep]. I GET IT.
- YOU START--

12:17.971 --> 12:19.739
YOU START OFF THE--
OFF THE WRONG FOOT.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.442
- I UNDERSTAND.
I AM FULLY AWARE.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.177
IT'S OUT OF INSECURITY,
TO BE HONEST.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.346
I'D RATHER BE A BETTER PERSON.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.748
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
ANOTHER BROKER IN THIS CITY

12:28.782 --> 12:30.517
WHO WILL STAB SOMEONE
IN THE BACK

12:30.550 --> 12:32.085
WHILE HE'S RUBBING
THEIR STOMACH,

12:32.118 --> 12:33.353
AND I AM NOT THAT GUY.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.622
- THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RYAN AND FREDRIK.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.091
THEY'RE THE SAME GUY,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE,

12:38.091 --> 12:41.361
BUT IF RYAN REALLY HAS
A BUYER FOR 30 LINCOLN,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.263
THIS COULD BE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

12:43.296 --> 12:45.231
TO REBUILD MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH JANET.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.702
TO SAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP
WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME,

12:48.735 --> 12:51.104
BUT THAT MEANS
I HAVE TO TRUST THIS GUY,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.306
AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE
I CAN DO THAT.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.941
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU WASTE MY TIME,

12:54.974 --> 12:56.810
I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR FACE.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.912
- I GOT IT.
- I'M NOT JOKING, RYAN.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.880
- I'M NOT JOKING EITHER.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.816
SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

13:06.720 --> 13:10.256
- DON'T [bleep] WITH ME, PLEASE.
- DON'T WORRY.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.059
SCOUT'S HONOR.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.260
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [bleep]
THAT MEANS, BUT--

13:14.294 --> 13:15.929
- IT'S BOY SCOUTS.
IT'S AN AMERICAN THING.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.898
- OKAY.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.600
- YOU STILL HAVE
MY POCKET SQUARE, BY THE WAY.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.603
- I--YOUR HANDKERCHIEF?
I WIPED MY ASS WITH IT.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.774
- OH, MY GOD.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.385
- JORDAN, SO HOW WAS
YOUR WEDDING, BY THE WAY?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.953
- IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.855
BEST SEAFOOD I'VE EVER HAD,
FANTASTIC.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.757
- HOW WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT?

13:43.790 --> 13:47.527
- THE WEDDING NIGHT WAS
PRETTY USUAL.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.862
SHE FELL ASLEEP.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.697
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.533
- NO, I'M SORRY I'M LAUGHING,
BUT WHY--WHAT DID SHE--LIKE--

13:53.566 --> 13:55.769
- THAT'S--YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY
PAR FOR THE COURSE, FREDRIK.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.770
[phone ringing]
- I'LL BE WITH--SHH.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.371
THIS IS THE BROKER.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.407
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.844
HOW ARE YOU?

14:04.878 --> 14:09.315
OH, YOU HAVE AN OFFER.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.751
YEAH.

14:11.785 --> 14:14.120
4.1 MILLION.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.758
OKAY, THIS BETTER BE
SOME SORT OF OPENING OFFER

14:18.792 --> 14:21.728
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ASKING 4,450,000,

14:21.761 --> 14:25.899
SO LET ME SPEAK TO MY CLIENT...
AND LET ME GET BACK TO YOU.

14:25.932 --> 14:29.903
4.1 IN PARK SLOPE,
THAT NUMBER IS HUGE ALREADY,

14:29.936 --> 14:32.739
AND I KNEW BRINGING
MANHATTAN BROKERS HERE

14:32.772 --> 14:35.175
WOULD BRING NICE, BIG,
FAST OFFERS.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.877
I'M GONNA TELL HER TO ACCEPT IT?
NO, IT'S AN OPENING OFFER,

14:37.911 --> 14:40.914
BUT I FEEL--I FEEL PROUD.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.086
- [laughs]

14:52.726 --> 14:55.228
- JANET.
- LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?

14:55.261 --> 14:57.097
- GOOD TO SEE YOU. MWAH.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.598
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR MEETING WITH ME.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.200
- YES, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
- I'M ACTUALLY VERY NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW

15:01.601 --> 15:05.138
BECAUSE LAST TIME I SAW JANET,
I WAS FIRED.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.907
LAST TIME JANET SAW RYAN, HE WAS
THROWN OUT OF HER OWN BUILDING.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.044
- I WILL HAVE A GLASS
OF<i>VINO BLANCO,</i>PLEASE.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.912
SO THE REASON
I BROUGHT YOU HERE.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.681
YOU REMEMBER RYAN SERHANT,

15:14.714 --> 15:16.549
THE BROKER THAT WAS HERE
IN OUR OPEN HOUSE

15:16.583 --> 15:18.218
THAT GOT KICKED OUT.
- OH, YES.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.819
YES.
[laughter]

15:19.853 --> 15:22.055
- SO HE'S CURRENTLY WORKING
WITH A BUYER

15:22.055 --> 15:24.257
THAT IS LOOKING AT APARTMENTS,
THREE, FOUR BEDROOM

15:24.290 --> 15:27.160
ANYWHERE FROM $6 TO $7 MILLION
IN THIS AREA,

15:27.193 --> 15:29.062
AND THEY HAVE LOOKED
AT EVERYTHING.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.564
NOW, HE APPROACHED ME
AND HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT

15:31.598 --> 15:33.833
BECAUSE HE KNEW I HAD A
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUILDING,

15:33.867 --> 15:36.169
AND I FEEL LIKE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT'S HERE,

15:36.202 --> 15:37.337
THEN AT LEAST, YOU KNOW--

15:37.370 --> 15:38.505
- OKAY, YOU DO UNDERSTAND,
THOUGH,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.373
THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE
YOUR COMMISSION.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.508
- I UNDERSTAND 100%.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.676
- OKAY.
- I UNDERSTAND 100%.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.177
- BECAUSE IF IT'S HIS CLIENT
IN HERE--

15:44.210 --> 15:45.445
- UNLESS HE WANTS
TO SPLIT IT WITH ME,

15:45.478 --> 15:46.613
THAT'S A DIFFERENT CASE.
- UNLESS HE WANTS TO.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.081
- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT--
- KNOWING RYAN,

15:48.081 --> 15:49.249
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENING.
- [laughs] OH, MY GOD.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.517
SO YOU DO KNOW HIM WELL.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.185
- BUT LISTEN, I THINK
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.587
- I WILL GO AHEAD
AND CHECK THE INVENTORY.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.357
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
ONE OR TWO UNITS

15:57.390 --> 15:59.192
THAT I HAVE IN MY POCKET.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.193
OKAY?
- OKAY.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.428
I KNOW SPECIFICALLY

16:01.461 --> 16:03.196
I'M NOT GONNA GET ANYTHING
OUT OF THIS DEAL,

16:03.229 --> 16:04.664
BUT THE REASON I'M DOING THIS
IS BECAUSE

16:04.698 --> 16:07.534
I STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I CARE.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.803
AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT IF I WASN'T ABLE

16:09.836 --> 16:11.805
TO DELIVER LAST TIME, THAT
AT LEAST I STEP UP TO THE PLATE

16:11.838 --> 16:14.407
AND BRING SOMETHING,
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.875
- WELL, THANK YOU.

16:15.909 --> 16:19.846
I DO APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM,
AND I DO APPRECIATE

16:19.879 --> 16:21.815
HOW HARD YOU TRIED,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.883
SO I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU, OKAY?

16:23.917 --> 16:26.720
- HEARING JANET SAYING
THAT SHE'S GOING TO TRUST ME

16:26.753 --> 16:29.055
MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE

16:29.055 --> 16:30.390
THAT RYAN DOESN'T PULL
ANYTHING STUPID.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.359
AND I'M GONNA CALL RYAN,
MAKE SURE THAT HE COMES IN.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.426
- ABSOLUTELY.
- DO A DEAL

16:33.460 --> 16:34.661
THAT'S ONE FOR THE BOOKS.
- YUP.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.062
- RIGHT NOW,
IT'S CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.264
LET ME GET TWO SHOTS OF TEQUILA
<i>POR FAVOR.</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:40.066
- [laughs]

16:47.374 --> 16:51.177
- THIS IS THE BUILDING.
SO IT'S CALLED 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.714
LUIS CALLED TO TELL ME
THAT JANET HAS A POCKET LISTING

16:54.748 --> 16:58.118
FOR MY CLIENT, SAM,
WHICH IS AWESOME.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.021
SAM WANTS
AT LEAST THREE BEDROOMS

17:01.054 --> 17:03.123
IN A CONDO FACING THE PARK,

17:03.156 --> 17:04.858
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE,

17:04.891 --> 17:07.560
LINCOLN CENTER IS
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.229
BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANTS,
HOTELS,

17:09.262 --> 17:11.464
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ON TOP
OF THE PARK.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.465
THERE'S A LOT OF ELEVATORS.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.801
MARK IS THE ATTORNEY FOR SAM.

17:14.834 --> 17:18.505
SAM IS A VERY, VERY BIG CLIENT
OF MINE FROM THE MIDWEST.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.374
- EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT
MY UNIT

17:21.408 --> 17:22.709
AND I'M MAKING
NO MONEY ON IT...

17:22.742 --> 17:23.810
[knocking at the door]
- HELLO, HELLO?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.178
- YES, HEY. HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- HEY.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.047
- I REALLY WANT TO SHOW
THIS UNIT BECAUSE

17:27.047 --> 17:28.815
I WANT TO REBUILD
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JANET,

17:28.848 --> 17:32.585
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT RYAN IS 100% SERIOUS

17:32.619 --> 17:34.554
BEFORE I SEND IT TO HER,
AND THEN HE WASTED HER TIME,

17:34.587 --> 17:35.822
AND I LOOK EVEN WORSE.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.390
SO WELCOME TO ONE
OF THE MOST SPECIAL APARTMENTS

17:37.424 --> 17:38.425
IN THIS BUILDING.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.364
THIS IS A FOUR-BEDROOM,
FOUR-BATHROOM,

17:44.397 --> 17:47.167
ABOUT 2,200 SQUARE FEET
PRICED AT 6.5 MILLION,

17:47.200 --> 17:48.501
AND IT'S FACING THE PARK.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.903
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
- YES.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.404
THE FINISHES THAT YOU'RE SEEING
HERE ARE BRAND NEW.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.506
NOBODY HAS EVER LIVED HERE
AFTER THE CONVERSION WAS DONE.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.841
- YEAH, THEY SPENT
A LOT OF MONEY HERE.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.710
- YES.
- KITCHENS A LITTLE SMALL

17:56.743 --> 17:58.745
FOR $6 1/2 MILLION.
- WELL, LISTEN, I--

17:58.778 --> 18:00.113
- TINY KITCHEN.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.848
- I WOULD PROBABLY OPEN THIS UP,
WHICH YOU CAN.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.149
- CAN YOU?
- HAVE AN ISLAND,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.651
AND IT LOOKS MUCH BIGGER.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.820
- IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, LISTEN, IT'S BRAND NEW.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.655
- ABSOLUTELY.
NO ONE HAS EVER USED THIS OVEN.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.156
NOBODY HAS EVER USED
THE BURNER.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.358
YOU HAVE A WINE COOLER
OVER THERE,

18:11.391 --> 18:13.126
SELF-CLOSING CABINETS.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.861
- IT'S NICE.
- OKAY.

18:14.894 --> 18:18.732
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN RYAN

18:18.765 --> 18:20.367
BEING A PROFESSIONAL.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.036
SO THIS IS THE MASTER BATHROOM.
BEAUTIFUL TILES,

18:23.036 --> 18:24.804
DOUBLE VANITY, STEAM SHOWER.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.340
- I MEAN THIS IS QUALITY
THAT DEVELOPERS DON'T DO.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.508
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.310
- NORMALLY--I ALWAYS EXPECTING
FOR HIM TO SAY,

18:30.343 --> 18:31.811
"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO,
I THINK YOU'RE TOO SMALL.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.513
"OH, NO, ENGLISH
IS YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.416
AH, YOU LOOK LIKE A DOORMAN,"
AND HE CALLS ME A CHIHUAHUA.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.817
THIS DOESN'T GET BETTER
THAN THIS.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.586
- IT'S TRUE THOUGH, IT'S TRUE.
LUIS IS RIGHT.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.187
- AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE'S ACTUALLY AGREEING

18:41.221 --> 18:45.225
WITH THINGS THAT I'M SAYING.
IT IS WEIRD.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.660
- THERE'S NOTHING MORE NEW YORK
THAN CENTRAL PARK.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.095
- THIS IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE,
THOUGH.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.164
- WHY ARE DIAMONDS SO EXPENSIVE?
'CAUSE THEY'RE RARE.

18:51.197 --> 18:54.834
THIS ADDS AT LEAST $500 A FOOT,
AT LEAST.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.102
- RIGHT. NO, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.370
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING.
HE'S BEEN LOOKING.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.873
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.274
- IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.842
- I THINK THIS ACTUALLY
WENT REALLY WELL.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.277
- THANKS FOR COMING.
- THANKS, RYAN.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.445
- SEE YOU, MAN.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.846
- I MEAN, I THINK
THIS COULD WORK.

19:06.880 --> 19:11.618
SO IF I SEND YOU AN OFFER
FOR 5.5 OR 5.6 OR SOMETHING,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.454
CAN WE BRIDGE THE GAP?
- WELL, IN REALITY,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.556
I WON'T BE NEGOTIATING
THIS DEAL WITH YOU.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.625
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THE APARTMENT.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.027
BUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE DEVELOPER'S SO IMPORTANT,

19:21.027 --> 19:22.295
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS WAS REAL

19:22.328 --> 19:24.497
BEFORE I, YOU KNOW, PUT YOU
IN TOUCH WITH ANYBODY.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.232
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY
IN THIS BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

19:26.266 --> 19:28.501
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- SO I'M GONNA PUT--

19:28.535 --> 19:31.705
LAST WEEK, I HAD--
I HAD A THING WITH FREDRIK

19:31.738 --> 19:33.306
WHERE WE WERE WORKING
ON SOMETHING TOGETHER.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.808
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
MUCH DETAILS,

19:34.841 --> 19:37.911
BUT IT ENDS UP BEING
THAT HE IS...

19:37.944 --> 19:39.446
HE'S A PIECE OF [bleep].

19:41.114 --> 19:43.083
- YOU DO NOT NEED THAT GUY.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.684
THIS IS YOUR DEVELOPER
IN THIS BUILDING, RIGHT?

19:44.718 --> 19:47.053
- YUP.
- THAT'S [bleep] RIGHT, MAN.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.855
I'M NOT HERE.
YOU'RE HERE.

19:48.888 --> 19:53.159
SO I WILL GET THIS DEAL DONE
AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN USE IT,

19:53.193 --> 19:54.361
TAKE OVER THE WHOLE BUILDING

19:54.394 --> 19:55.662
AND GO OFF AND GET
ALL THEIR OTHER BUILDINGS.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.930
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SALES
FOR THEM.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.498
I'LL PUT YOU IN TOUCH
WITH JANET, AND THEN--

19:58.531 --> 19:59.566
- I'LL MAKE THE OFFER
THROUGH HER.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.867
- YEAH.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.102
- AND YOU REALLY DON'T GET
ANYTHING ON THIS?

20:02.135 --> 20:04.204
- DON'T WORRY.
I GET MUCH MORE THAN MONEY.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.373
I GET A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

20:06.406 --> 20:10.410
TIME WILL ONLY TELL,
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT

20:10.443 --> 20:13.546
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED RYAN.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.018
- TONIGHT IS DEREK'S
AND MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.386
- HI.
- HI, BABE.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.387
- I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.955
- THIS COULD BE IT.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.056
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.803
- NOW THAT I'VE SHOWN RYAN
THE APARTMENT AT 30 LINCOLN,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.139
IT'S UP TO HIM TO CONVINCE
HIS BUYERS TO SUBMIT AN OFFER,

20:39.172 --> 20:40.807
BUT SINCE THIS IS
OUT OF MY CONTROL,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.443
I AM OFF TO MY NEXT LISTING
AT 75 WALL.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.779
75 WALL IS LOCATED
ON WALL STREET,

20:45.812 --> 20:47.213
THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD

20:47.247 --> 20:48.948
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.051
IT'S THE FASTEST GROWING
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD

20:51.084 --> 20:54.087
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN,
SO IT'S VERY EXCITING.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.191
MR. MICHAEL, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- LUIS.

20:58.224 --> 20:59.392
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

20:59.426 --> 21:00.393
- PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.
- THANKS FOR COMING DOWN.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.428
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.096
IN 2009, 75 WALL STREET
WAS CONVERTED

21:03.129 --> 21:06.399
FROM AN OFFICE BUILDING
INTO A HALF FIVE-STAR HOTEL,

21:06.433 --> 21:09.602
WHICH IS THE ANDAZ,
AND HALF LUXURY RESIDENCES,

21:09.636 --> 21:13.540
AND TOGETHER, THEY SERVE AS ONE
OF THE MOST LUXURIOUS BUILDINGS

21:13.573 --> 21:15.375
IN ALL OF DOWNTOWN.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.111
- COME ON IN.
- VERY NICE.

21:20.814 --> 21:23.616
- TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
THERE'S VIEWS FROM EVERY CORNER.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.254
FIVE-FIXTURE MASTER BATHROOM.
- OH, VERY NICE.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.259
- SECOND BEDROOM.
- IT'S A NICE BEDROOM SIZE,

21:33.293 --> 21:36.129
BUT IT'S AN UNUSUAL LAYOUT.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.431
IT'S NOT YOUR NORMAL
SQUARE FLOOR PLAN,

21:38.465 --> 21:41.101
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO,
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY,

21:41.101 --> 21:42.969
BUT IT REALLY IS
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.573
ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE VIEW?

21:46.606 --> 21:49.376
- I LOVE THIS VIEW.
YOU CAN SEE THE EMPIRE STATE.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.977
- THIS IS
QUINTESSENTIAL NEW YORK.

21:51.011 --> 21:55.215
- THIS APARTMENT DESCRIBES
WHAT 75 WALL REALLY IS,

21:55.248 --> 21:58.318
WHICH IS A VERY SEXY
KIND OF OPEN, MODERN PENTHOUSE,

21:58.351 --> 21:59.586
AND AS AN OWNER,
YOU CAN SHARE

21:59.619 --> 22:01.388
SOME OF THE AMENITIES
OF THE HOTEL.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.156
THERE'S A FITNESS CENTER.
THERE'S A MEDIA ROOM.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.657
THERE IS A LOUNGE
WITH POOL TABLES.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.760
IT'S PERFECT.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.062
WHEN I STARTED REAL ESTATE
IN 2008, I STARTED RENTALS,

22:09.062 --> 22:10.897
AND I RENTED
AT LEAST 20 APARTMENTS

22:10.930 --> 22:12.165
IN EVERY SINGLE BUILDING
DOWN HERE.

22:12.198 --> 22:16.236
63 WALL STREET, 20 EXCHANGE,
15 WILLIAM, 15 BROAD STREET.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.704
- SO YOU SEEM TO KNOW THIS AREA
PRETTY WELL.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.172
- I KNOW THIS AREA
EXTREMELY WELL.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.540
I WAS A WALL STREET GUY.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.375
- SO YOU MUST BE WONDERING
WHY I BROUGHT YOU HERE.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.410
- YES, I AM.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.178
- THE DEVELOPER
OF THIS DEVELOPMENT

22:25.211 --> 22:28.214
ASKED ME TO REACH OUT TO YOU.
HE LOVES YOUR ENERGY.

22:28.248 --> 22:30.383
HE THINKS THAT YOU REPRESENT
WHAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS,

22:30.417 --> 22:32.352
WHAT THIS WHOLE AREA--
- I LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.953
- SEEMS LIKE IT.

22:33.987 --> 22:35.388
WE REALLY WANT TO GET
TOP DOLLAR,

22:35.422 --> 22:37.691
AND WE THINK
YOU'RE THE PERSON TO DO IT.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.092
WOULD YOU BE
UP FOR THIS CHALLENGE?

22:39.092 --> 22:41.227
- ABSOLUTELY.
I AM YOUR GUY.

22:41.261 --> 22:43.263
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
FOR THE UNIT?

22:43.296 --> 22:48.468
- THE DEVELOPER THINKS
YOU COULD GET 2.82 FOR IT.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.903
- THE AVERAGE PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT

22:49.936 --> 22:51.471
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT
IS ABOUT 1,500,

22:51.504 --> 22:54.240
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM NOT PITCHING THE DEVELOPER.

22:54.274 --> 22:56.109
THE DEVELOPER IS ASKING
FOR MY REQUEST,

22:56.109 --> 22:57.977
AND IF I SAY
THAT I CAN'T DO IT,

22:58.011 --> 22:59.346
THEY'RE GONNA GO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.181
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY,
AND I HAVE TO DO IT.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.816
OKAY.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.318
IF HE WANTS THAT MUCH,
WE GOT TO JUSTIFY THAT.

23:05.352 --> 23:07.654
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A PENTHOUSE APARTMENT.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.090
PENTHOUSE HAS TO BE SPECIAL.
RIGHT NOW AS-IS,

23:10.123 --> 23:13.093
I DON'T THINK WE EVEN HAVE
A SHOT AT $1,900 A FOOT.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.160
THIS APARTMENT
IS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL,

23:14.194 --> 23:15.528
BUT THERE'S
A LITTLE CHALLENGE.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.398
THE FLOOR PLAN IS SHAPED
IN A VERY UNIQUE KIND OF WAY,

23:18.431 --> 23:21.501
AND MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT EVEN
BE ABLE TO PICTURE

23:21.534 --> 23:23.103
HOW THEY WOULD BE ABLE
TO PUT THE FURNITURE.

23:23.136 --> 23:24.904
WE JUST GOT TO DRESS IT UP
IN A WAY THAT THEY COME IN,

23:24.938 --> 23:28.408
THEY SAY, "WOW, THIS IS...
THIS IS SPECTACULAR."

23:28.441 --> 23:31.444
I THINK THIS APARTMENT,
IT'S KEY THAT WE STAGE IT,

23:31.478 --> 23:33.079
AND NOT JUST STAGE IT,
BUT STAGE IT RIGHT.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.548
SO THIS IS A DEAL?

23:37.117 --> 23:38.518
- THIS IS A DEAL.
ARE YOU ON BOARD?

23:38.551 --> 23:39.853
- I AM.
- CAN YOU GET ME TOP DOLLAR?

23:39.886 --> 23:41.254
- 100%.
- GLAD TO HAVE YOU

23:41.287 --> 23:43.323
ON BOARD, LUIS.
- OKAY.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.968
- AFTER THE SHOWING WITH LUIS,
MY BUYER'S ATTORNEY MARK CALLED

23:55.001 --> 23:58.104
TO PUT IN AN OFFER
FOR 5.75 MILLION,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.073
WHICH IS AWESOME.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.175
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
JANET DIDN'T THINK SO

24:02.208 --> 24:05.145
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

24:05.178 --> 24:07.580
AND THAT, COUPLED WITH THE FACT
THAT THE LAST TIME I SAW JANET

24:07.614 --> 24:10.483
I WAS BEING ESCORTED OUT
OF HER BUILDING BY SECURITY...

24:10.517 --> 24:13.253
- GUYS, TAKE HIM OUT.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:13.286 --> 24:16.156
MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE TO TREAD
A LITTLE LIGHTLY.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.657
HELLO.
- HEY.

24:17.691 --> 24:19.192
- HI.
- HI, THERE, HOW ARE YOU?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.928
- GOOD. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- MM. [chuckles]

24:21.961 --> 24:23.229
- WHERE WE GOING?

24:24.731 --> 24:26.332
- THERE'S A REASON WHY
I WANTED TO BRING YOU

24:26.366 --> 24:29.369
BACK TO THIS APARTMENT, AND
I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN IT ALREADY.

24:29.402 --> 24:34.274
THE OFFER THAT YOU PRESENTED
FOR THIS VISTA...

24:34.307 --> 24:36.076
- MM-HMM.
- IS JUST NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.278
- I COMPLETELY GET
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING,

24:38.311 --> 24:40.880
AND I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU TAKING THE TIME TO MEET ME.

24:40.914 --> 24:45.218
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH
NORTH OF 2,900 A FOOT.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.287
- THERE'S NO WAY
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

24:47.320 --> 24:51.624
TO FIND AN APARTMENT LIKE THIS
AT THIS PRICE RANGE.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.727
- WHAT'S THE MOST RECENT
THREE-UNIT COMBINATION

24:53.760 --> 24:56.096
THAT'S CLOSED
IN THE LAST YEAR?

24:56.096 --> 24:59.532
- HOW ABOUT LAST WEEK?
WE SOLD IT FOR 6.9.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.834
- AND THAT'S NOT PUBLIC RECORD,
IS IT?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.035
- NO. NO.

25:02.035 --> 25:05.038
THE DEAL WILL BE PROBABLY SIGNED
THIS AFTERNOON.

25:05.038 --> 25:07.907
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT IS
IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING,

25:07.941 --> 25:09.042
WHICH--
- PROCESS?

25:09.042 --> 25:10.043
- PROCESS.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.378
- I UNDERSTAND WHY JANET
IS QUOTING ME

25:11.411 --> 25:14.347
THESE PENDING DEALS,
BUT THE TRUTH IS

25:14.381 --> 25:19.152
THAT THEY'RE PENDING,
AND A COMP ISN'T REALLY A COMP

25:19.185 --> 25:20.887
UNTIL IT'S CLOSED.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.055
WHAT'S THE HIGHEST PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT

25:22.055 --> 25:23.223
THAT'S CLOSED
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS?

25:23.256 --> 25:26.059
THAT'S CLOSED PUBLICLY,
DO YOU KNOW?

25:26.059 --> 25:28.762
YOU HAVE ANOTHER--
A "P"--I THINK IT WAS P.R.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.497
THERE'S A P.R. LINE.
- THERE'S A P.R.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.932
- THAT SOLD AT, LIKE,
2,600 A FOOT.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.834
- MM-HMM.
- AND THAT'S PUBLIC RECORD.

25:34.868 --> 25:40.073
I CAN WORK WITH HIM,
BUT NOT AT OVER 2,900 A FOOT.

25:40.073 --> 25:43.376
SO I NEED A COUNTER FROM YOU.

25:43.410 --> 25:46.079
- THE NAME OF THE GAME IS
LET'S MAKE A DEAL, OKAY?

25:46.079 --> 25:48.214
- I LIKE YOU.
THAT'S THE NAME OF MY GAME TOO.

25:48.248 --> 25:51.084
- SO LET'S TRY TO MAKE A DEAL,
AND I'M GOING TO GO

25:51.084 --> 25:55.088
FROM 6.5 DOWN TO 6.3.

25:55.088 --> 25:58.158
YOU MAKE NICE FACES.
LET ME SEE THAT ONE AGAIN.

25:58.191 --> 25:59.359
- NO, I ONLY DO IT ONCE.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.028
SO THAT'S A LITTLE OVER
2,800 A FOOT.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.063
- YEAH.

26:03.096 --> 26:04.497
- [laughs]
- NO, I'LL BUY. IT'S ON ME.

26:04.531 --> 26:06.032
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.300
I DON'T KNOW.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.235
I WOULDN'T THINK THAT JANET
IS SUSCEPTIBLE

26:09.269 --> 26:12.038
TO THE RYAN SERHANT CHARM,

26:12.038 --> 26:14.307
BUT I KNOW
WHEN I'M WALKING AWAY,

26:14.341 --> 26:17.077
SHE'S WATCHING ME GO.

26:17.110 --> 26:19.079
[line ringing]
- HELLO.

26:19.112 --> 26:20.680
- HEY, MARK, IT'S RYAN.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.484
I'M HERE WITH THE DEVELOPER.
SHE CALLED ME HERE,

26:24.517 --> 26:27.220
AND SHE JUST COUNTERED
AT 6.3.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.688
- [sighs]

26:28.722 --> 26:30.323
- WE'RE NOT GONNA GET IT
WITH A 5 IN FRONT OF IT.

26:30.357 --> 26:32.492
I THINK WE NEED TO COME UP.

26:32.525 --> 26:38.064
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AUTHORIZATION
TO COME BACK AT?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.065
- [sighs]

26:46.072 --> 26:48.108
AND THAT'S A STRETCH.
- THIS IS--OKAY.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.276
I'M NOT SURE THIS DEAL
IS GETTING DONE TODAY.

27:04.591 --> 27:06.126
- I'M MEETING WITH JEANNE
TOMORROW NIGHT

27:06.159 --> 27:09.662
TO DISCUSS THE BROOKLYN OFFER,
BUT TONIGHT IS DEREK'S

27:09.696 --> 27:11.898
AND MY ONE-YEAR
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.066
MMM.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.035
WE GOT MARRIED ONE YEAR AGO
TONIGHT,

27:15.035 --> 27:18.838
AND DEREK SAYS HE'S
COMING HOME WITH A SURPRISE,

27:18.872 --> 27:20.907
AND IT GETS ME NERVOUS
AND EXCITED

27:20.940 --> 27:25.178
BECAUSE AFTER THE OPEN HOUSE AND
WATCHING HIM WITH THOSE KIDS...

27:25.211 --> 27:28.148
- THEN YOU HAVE TO DIP IN,
A LITTLE GROOVE LIKE THAT.

27:28.181 --> 27:29.749
TYLER, YOU WATCHING?

27:29.783 --> 27:33.053
- MAYBE HE REALIZED
THAT IT IS TIME TO HAVE A BABY.

27:33.053 --> 27:34.521
OKAY.

27:34.554 --> 27:37.057
I PUT CANDLES EVERYWHERE.
I'M PREPARING FOOD.

27:37.057 --> 27:40.226
ALMOST DONE.
PRITZI, NOT FOR YOU.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.729
THIS COULD BE IT.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.067
- HI.
- HI, BABE.

27:47.067 --> 27:49.402
- WHOA!
THIS IS A NICE LITTLE TREAT.

27:49.436 --> 27:52.072
WHAT A SURPRISE.
MM.

27:52.072 --> 27:55.075
- LOOK, I MADE IT FOR US
WITH ALL THE PHOTOS

27:55.108 --> 27:59.179
FROM ALL THE TRIPS.
- WOW.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.281
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

28:01.314 --> 28:03.650
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?

28:03.683 --> 28:06.353
IS IT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
- [laughs]

28:06.386 --> 28:09.689
- 'CAUSE OF THE--

28:09.723 --> 28:12.092
- [chuckles]

28:13.727 --> 28:16.329
LOOK WHAT I HAVE.

28:16.363 --> 28:19.065
[chuckles]

28:19.099 --> 28:22.402
OH.
[kiss]

28:22.435 --> 28:25.572
COME HERE, LITTLE BOY.
COME HERE, LITTLE BOY.

28:25.605 --> 28:27.040
OH.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.343
- BABE.
- OH, YES.

28:30.377 --> 28:35.081
HIS NAME IS MILO.
IT'S A BOY VERSION OF "MILLA."

28:35.115 --> 28:38.251
- AS SOON AS I SEE THE DOG,
I REALIZE

28:38.284 --> 28:41.721
THAT EVERY LITTLE WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY

28:41.755 --> 28:44.157
WHEN IT COMES TO MILLA
IS FINALLY CLOSED.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.492
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?

28:45.525 --> 28:47.394
- THAT'S THE LAST STATEMENT
THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

28:47.427 --> 28:51.831
THE BABY GIRL, MILLA, HAS TURNED
INTO A MALE MINIATURE DACHSHUND.

28:51.865 --> 28:53.500
- I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.
- [sighs]

28:53.533 --> 28:56.536
- DOESN'T HE MAKE YOU HAPPY?
- BABE, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.438
WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS GONNA BE
A SURPRISE, I THOUGHT

28:58.471 --> 29:01.007
THAT YOU HAD FINALLY--
AFTER ALL OUR DISCUSSIONS,

29:01.007 --> 29:02.509
YOU HAD MADE A DECISION
THAT IT WAS--

29:02.542 --> 29:06.146
WE WERE GONNA HAVE MILLA,
WE WERE GONNA HAVE A DAUGHTER.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.048
YOU GO BUY A PUPPY?

29:08.081 --> 29:09.849
- NO, I THOUGHT WE UNDERSTOOD
WE'RE NOT READY

29:09.883 --> 29:11.184
TO HAVE A CHILD YET.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.720
- THAT'S THE POINT.
WE NEVER AGREED.

29:13.753 --> 29:16.222
JUST ONE SECOND.

29:16.256 --> 29:20.694
THIS--I GOT TO--OH, LET ME--
I NEED TO BREATHE.

29:20.727 --> 29:22.696
MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE,

29:22.729 --> 29:26.533
IT'S HOW I'M WIRED
IS TO MAKE A DEAL.

29:26.566 --> 29:28.034
- BABY, COME HERE.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.904
- AND HERE I AM,
AND I CAN'T DO THIS DEAL,

29:30.937 --> 29:34.841
A DEAL THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT FOR OVER TEN YEARS.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.676
AND I FEEL DEVASTATED.

29:37.677 --> 29:40.180
[murmurs]
OH, MY GOD.

29:41.081 --> 29:42.215
I'VE GOT AN OFFER.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.650
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS ASKING FOR.

29:43.683 --> 29:47.120
I EXPECT THE PRICE
THAT WE AGREED ON.

29:54.594 --> 29:56.830
- SO HOWARD, THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE EVEN TAKING THE TIME

29:56.863 --> 29:58.932
TO BE SITTING WITH ME
AFTER I READ ABOUT YOU,

29:58.965 --> 30:00.200
AFTER I'VE SEEN
WHAT YOU'VE BUILT,

30:00.233 --> 30:01.868
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME,

30:01.901 --> 30:03.169
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT.

30:03.203 --> 30:05.572
- LOOK, LUIS, YOU CAN COME TO ME
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

30:05.605 --> 30:08.074
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU, BUT
I HAVE TO WARN YOU OF ONE THING.

30:08.108 --> 30:11.111
I AM NOT VERY GOOD AT TELLING
PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.912
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE,

30:12.946 --> 30:16.182
SO IF YOU CAN HANDLE THAT,
THEN YOU CAN COME TO ME ANYTIME.

30:16.216 --> 30:17.917
- IF THERE'S ANYBODY
IN THIS REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY

30:17.951 --> 30:20.053
THAT I REALLY, REALLY RESPECT
AND LOOK UP TO,

30:20.086 --> 30:22.088
IT'S HOWARD LORBER,
THE OWNER OF DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

30:22.122 --> 30:23.857
THIS GUY IS A BUSINESSMAN,

30:23.890 --> 30:26.126
THIS GUY IS AS SMART
AS THEY COME,

30:26.159 --> 30:28.094
AND HE'S A REAL BILLIONAIRE,

30:28.128 --> 30:29.596
AND THE FACT
THAT HE TAKES THE TIME

30:29.629 --> 30:32.599
TO SIT DOWN WITH ME AND LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY...

30:32.632 --> 30:34.034
THAT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

30:34.067 --> 30:36.069
HAVING HOWARD LORBER
AS A MENTOR,

30:36.102 --> 30:37.871
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.
BOOM. [laughs]

30:37.904 --> 30:40.306
- WHAT'S THIS "BOOM," LUIS?
I NEVER SAW THIS BOOM BEFORE.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.208
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST TO FINISH A STATEMENT.

30:42.242 --> 30:43.276
BOOM.
- BOOM.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.911
- BOOM.
- BOOM.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.479
- BOOM.
[laughs]

30:46.513 --> 30:47.981
- I GOT TO GET USED TO "BOOM."
- YOU WILL.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.849
- BOOM.
- [laughs]

31:00.393 --> 31:01.728
AND THAT'S A STRETCH.
- THIS IS--

31:01.761 --> 31:03.897
OKAY.
I MEAN, I CAN PLAY WITH THAT.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.965
- OKAY.
- I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER.

31:09.069 --> 31:11.071
OH.
COULD YOU HEAR ME IN THERE?

31:11.104 --> 31:13.239
- [chuckles]
I WASN'T EAVESDROPPING.

31:13.273 --> 31:14.908
- I HEARD YOU JUST RUN
ACROSS BACK FROM THERE.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.509
- [laughs]
- [clears throat]

31:16.543 --> 31:18.845
SO I SPOKE TO THE ATTORNEY.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.613
WE CAN DO 6,
AND THAT'S IT.

31:20.647 --> 31:23.516
- NOW, LET ME TRY
TO REMEMBER THIS.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.585
WAS THAT THE FACE?
- YEAH.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.120
- WAS IT CLOSE?
- THAT WAS CLOSE.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.588
- OKAY.

31:28.621 --> 31:30.423
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

31:30.457 --> 31:32.092
ALL RIGHT, NO--
AH, AH, MY TURN.

31:32.092 --> 31:33.960
- I--
- AH, MY TURN.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.595
- IT'S YOUR BUILDING. YOU CAN
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU WANT.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.098
HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD
SIT CLOSER. ALL RIGHT?

31:38.098 --> 31:39.499
YOU HAVE A GREAT BUILDING HERE--
- DO YOU REALIZE YOUR HAND

31:39.532 --> 31:40.900
IS ON ME?
- IS IT?

31:40.934 --> 31:42.168
OH, IT'S AN INSTINCTUAL THING.

31:42.202 --> 31:43.703
IT'S SO--SO WEIRD, SORRY.
- MM-HMM.

31:43.737 --> 31:47.173
- DID YOU MIND IT?
- [laughs] OH, STOP IT.

31:47.207 --> 31:48.375
I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR MOTHER.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.110
- THAT'S OKAY.
- [laughs]

31:50.110 --> 31:51.644
- WHAT'S YOUR BOTTOM LINE?
LET'S JUST CUT THROUGH IT,

31:51.678 --> 31:53.680
RIGHT? LET'S CUT THROUGH IT.
- OKAY.

31:53.713 --> 31:57.384
BOTTOM LINE, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
AT 6.1, AND THAT'S IT.

32:01.254 --> 32:04.057
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE SO DIFFICULT.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.060
IN A GOOD WAY.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.696
- THIS IS HIS LAST SHOT BECAUSE
I'M NOT GONNA LET IT GO AT 6.

32:09.729 --> 32:11.164
I'M JUST NOT.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.732
- OH, YOU'RE MAKING
MY BODY TENSE.

32:12.766 --> 32:14.401
OKAY,
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

32:14.434 --> 32:17.537
I'M HAPPY WITH THIS NUMBER.
I GOT HER DOWN A LOT.

32:17.570 --> 32:19.939
I'M JUST HOPING THAT MY BUYERS
WILL KEEP COMING UP.

32:19.973 --> 32:22.242
[line ringing]
- HELLO.

32:22.275 --> 32:24.077
- HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

32:24.077 --> 32:26.579
- SO THEY'LL DO 6.1.
WE'LL CALL IT A DEAL.

32:26.613 --> 32:27.747
- [sighs]

32:29.883 --> 32:31.117
- I PRESENTED EVERYTHING
TO YOU GUYS,

32:31.151 --> 32:32.919
AND THIS IS LITERALLY
THE ONLY ONE

32:32.952 --> 32:34.087
THAT CHECKS ALL THE BOXES.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.588
DID YOU TALK TO HIM
ABOUT MAYBE GETTING,

32:35.622 --> 32:37.557
LIKE, AUTHORIZATION
TO GO OVER 6, OR NO?

32:46.199 --> 32:51.304
- [sighs] UM...
- AND?

32:51.338 --> 32:57.310
- UH, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S, YOU KNOW,

32:57.344 --> 32:59.145
BECAUSE I AM SO GOOD

32:59.179 --> 33:00.647
AT WHAT I DO...
- [laughs]

33:00.680 --> 33:03.650
- AND BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH POWER
OF PERSUASION,

33:03.683 --> 33:06.720
WE HAVE A DEAL, 6.1.

33:06.753 --> 33:08.655
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- SO WE HAVE A DEAL?

33:08.688 --> 33:10.156
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

33:10.190 --> 33:13.193
- IN HONOR OF THE GUY
WHO HELPED MAKE THIS HAPPEN,

33:13.226 --> 33:15.095
"BOOM!"

33:16.396 --> 33:17.364
AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT?

33:17.397 --> 33:19.132
- I FEEL GOOD.

33:25.405 --> 33:28.074
- MR. MICHAEL, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- AH, LUIS.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.175
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

33:29.209 --> 33:30.910
- WELCOME ABOARD.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:30.944 --> 33:33.079
BECAUSE THE LAYOUT OF
THE PENTHOUSE AT 75 WALL STREET

33:33.079 --> 33:36.182
IS SO UNIQUE, IT'S GOING TO BE
A CHALLENGE FOR ME TO SELL IT.

33:36.216 --> 33:38.184
SO I PUT TOGETHER A DREAM TEAM
TO MAKE THIS ALL HAPPEN.

33:38.218 --> 33:41.087
THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IS THE ONE
WHO DID MY APARTMENT

33:41.087 --> 33:42.956
IN BATTERY PARK CITY,
THE ONE THAT I LIVE IN

33:42.989 --> 33:44.124
RIGHT NOW,
AND I'M VERY HAPPY.

33:44.157 --> 33:46.326
I HAVE A CREATIVE DIRECTOR,
EVENT PLANNER.

33:46.359 --> 33:48.561
I HAVE A P.R. PERSON.
I HAVE A DESIGNER.

33:48.595 --> 33:49.996
KEN?
- HELLO.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.865
- WOW, YOU REALLY LIKE
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.400
HE'S AT HOME. LOOK AT
ALL THE TREES AND THE COFFEE.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.235
JESUS.
- [laughs]

33:55.268 --> 33:57.637
- ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
THE FIRST HIGH RISE BUILDING

33:57.671 --> 33:59.105
THAT HAS A PENTHOUSE
ON WALL STREET,

33:59.105 --> 34:02.409
SO I WAS THINKING SOMETHING
LIKE "ON TOP OF THE WALL."

34:02.442 --> 34:05.245
75 WALL STREET HAS ALREADY
A GREAT BRAND,

34:05.278 --> 34:08.048
BUT I THINK WE NEED
TO FRESHEN THE BRAND.

34:08.048 --> 34:09.582
SO LET'S START WITH STAGING.

34:09.616 --> 34:11.818
RIGHT NOW, WE OBVIOUSLY--YOU
KNOW, THE PENTHOUSES ARE EMPTY,

34:11.851 --> 34:13.753
SO WE HAVE TO STAGE THEM,
AND WE HAVE TO BRING

34:13.787 --> 34:16.056
THE PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER
TO THE APARTMENTS.

34:16.056 --> 34:19.759
- IF I CAN SEE HERE YOU HAVE A--
IT'S A VERY ANGLED APARTMENT,

34:19.793 --> 34:22.862
SO WE WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY
INCORPORATE A LOT OF CURVES

34:22.896 --> 34:26.533
AND SOFTNESS TO COUNTERBALANCE
THE ANGLES OF THE APARTMENT.

34:26.566 --> 34:28.201
AND YOU'LL BRING IT
MORE TO THE FEMININE SIDE,

34:28.234 --> 34:30.770
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE MASCULINE SIDE,

34:30.804 --> 34:33.340
YOU BRING, YOU KNOW,
THE BLACK AND WHITE.

34:33.373 --> 34:35.342
WHY NOT? SO CLASSIC.

34:35.375 --> 34:39.679
- SO LET'S DO A BLEND
OF WOMEN AND MEN, VERY SEXY.

34:39.713 --> 34:41.614
WE'RE THINKING SOMETHING,
LIKE, MAYBE HOTEL-LIKE.

34:41.648 --> 34:44.884
- SIMPLE BUT EXTREMELY ELEGANT.
I SEE MIRROR.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.654
I SEE LACQUER.
I SEE LEATHER.

34:47.687 --> 34:48.888
- I SEE--I SEE IT.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.157
- "I SEE"--YOU SEE IT? YEAH.
- I SEE IT SOLD.

34:51.191 --> 34:52.692
- I SEE IT SOLD.
[laughter]

34:52.726 --> 34:55.362
- ALL RIGHT, SO FAR--
SO NOW, WE GOT THE PERSONALITY

34:55.395 --> 34:56.363
AND THE CHARACTER
OF THE APARTMENT.

34:56.396 --> 34:57.997
NOW, HOW DO WE GET THIS
OUT THERE?

34:58.098 --> 35:00.734
- WE NEED THE PERFECT EVENT.
IT HAS TO BE

35:00.767 --> 35:04.637
THE GRAND UNVEILING OF
THE ULTIMATE FI-DI PENTHOUSES.

35:04.671 --> 35:07.073
- WE NEED TO GET THIS ROLLING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.141
- DEAL.
- WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.410
- LET'S DO IT.
- I'M EXCITED.

35:18.084 --> 35:19.552
- HI.
- HELLO, FREDRIK.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.054
- HI, LOVE.

35:21.054 --> 35:23.189
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE WEARING
RED TOO. MWAH.

35:23.223 --> 35:25.158
I RECEIVED AN OFFER
FOR THE TOWNHOUSE,

35:25.191 --> 35:27.727
SO I WANT TO MEET WITH JEANNE
AND PRESENT IT IN PERSON.

35:27.761 --> 35:30.363
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER.
HOW CAN YOU DENY THIS FACE?

35:30.397 --> 35:32.265
I MEAN--

35:32.298 --> 35:34.534
CHEERS.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.103
- CHEERS TO GOOD NEWS.
- MMM...

35:37.137 --> 35:38.505
- DELICIOUS.

35:38.538 --> 35:41.708
- NOW, I HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU.

35:41.741 --> 35:44.110
HOLD ON TO THE SOFA,
I'M TELLING YOU.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.278
I'M SERIOUS.
- I NEED TO DO THAT?

35:45.311 --> 35:47.113
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO FALL OFF,
LIKE, IN EXCITEMENT.

35:47.147 --> 35:51.084
I GOT AN OFFER.

35:51.084 --> 35:54.387
4.1 MILLION.

35:54.421 --> 35:56.356
[thumping on table]

35:59.092 --> 36:03.229
REALLY?
I MEAN, HELLO. SMILE.

36:03.263 --> 36:04.731
LET'S BE EXCITED.

36:04.764 --> 36:08.902
- UM, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS ASKING FOR, WAS IT?

36:10.403 --> 36:12.839
WE LISTED IT AT THE 4.450,

36:12.872 --> 36:17.177
AND I EXPECT THE PRICE
THAT WE AGREED ON.

36:17.210 --> 36:21.181
- IT'S A SELLER'S RIGHT
TO FORGET WHAT WE AGREED ON.

36:21.214 --> 36:23.216
- HOW ABOUT 4.450?

36:23.249 --> 36:25.051
- WELL, JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

36:25.051 --> 36:27.520
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME BUILT-IN DISCOUNT IN THAT.

36:27.554 --> 36:30.090
I STILL WANT YOU
TO BE ECSTATIC

36:30.123 --> 36:31.658
WHEN IT TRADES
A LITTLE LOWER THAN THAT.

36:31.691 --> 36:33.259
- I WILL BE.

36:33.293 --> 36:34.961
- NOW SHE WANTS THE FULL ASK.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.199
- THIS IS NOT GONNA
HELP ME CALM DOWN.

36:39.232 --> 36:40.600
- WELL, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.602
I SAID, "SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 4.1 AND 4.3"

36:42.635 --> 36:43.803
WHEN WE MET
IN THE LISTING APPOINTMENT,

36:43.837 --> 36:47.140
AND HERE I AM,
SETTING A RECORD ALREADY AT 4.1,

36:47.173 --> 36:49.976
AND THIS IS YOUR REACTION?
- UH, YEAH.

36:50.076 --> 36:52.679
- I MEAN, 4.450,
OUR ASKING PRICE,

36:52.712 --> 36:54.814
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

36:54.848 --> 36:57.350
YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN A WORLD
WHERE THERE'S COMPARABLES.

36:57.384 --> 36:59.185
THERE HAS BEEN
SOME BIGGER SALES,

36:59.219 --> 37:01.054
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, REAL MANSIONS,

37:01.087 --> 37:03.056
CORNERS ON THE PARK,
FACING THE PARK.

37:03.089 --> 37:05.658
WE'RE NOT, LIKE, ON THE PARK.
IN OUR CATEGORY, WE--

37:05.692 --> 37:08.294
THIS IS A RECORD ALR--
AT 4.1, IT'S A RECORD.

37:08.328 --> 37:10.030
SO SAY, "FREDRIK,
YOU'RE DOING AN AMAZING JOB."

37:10.063 --> 37:12.032
I MEAN, I DON'T NEED VALIDATION.
I KNOW THAT I'M GOOD,

37:12.065 --> 37:14.734
BUT, LIKE, YOUR ENERGY HERE
IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME.

37:14.768 --> 37:17.570
- I'M WILLING TO NEGOTIATE
AND BE REASONABLE,

37:17.604 --> 37:19.506
BUT 4.1 IS FAR TOO LOW.

37:19.539 --> 37:22.676
YOU HAVE TO DO MORE.
- HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

37:22.709 --> 37:26.913
- I WANT YOU TO GET NEAR 4.3.

37:26.946 --> 37:30.850
- I LIKE A TOUGH, PARK SLOPE
MOM BUSINESSWOMAN.

37:30.884 --> 37:32.819
- MM-HMM.
- MAYBE I WILL BE ONE TOO

37:32.852 --> 37:35.188
ONE DAY.
LET ME MAKE A CALL,

37:35.221 --> 37:37.090
BUT--
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

37:37.123 --> 37:39.959
THE WORD "BUT."
MAKE A CALL, AND LET'S SEE.

37:42.395 --> 37:44.664
- [sighs]
[line ringing]

37:44.698 --> 37:48.301
[breathing in sharply]
[line ringing]

37:48.335 --> 37:50.503
HI, IT'S ME, FREDRIK.

37:50.537 --> 37:54.941
SO I JUST MET WITH MY CLIENT,
AND...

37:54.974 --> 37:57.143
I HAVE REALLY GOOD NEWS.

37:57.177 --> 38:00.013
NO, NOT ACCEPTED, REJECTED.

38:00.013 --> 38:02.015
WHAT I MEANT WITH "GOOD NEWS"
IS THAT WE'RE CLOSE.

38:02.015 --> 38:04.184
WE'RE CLOSE. WE'RE CLOSE.
SHE'S WARMING UP.

38:04.217 --> 38:06.820
THE THING IS, THOUGH,
SHE'S NOT TAKING

38:06.853 --> 38:09.889
ANYTHING LESS THAN 4.3.
THAT IS VERY CLEAR.

38:09.923 --> 38:13.460
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

38:13.493 --> 38:15.729
THAT IF YOUR BUYERS
WOULD CONTINUE LOOKING

38:15.762 --> 38:18.031
WHERE THEY STARTED,
UPPER WEST SIDE,

38:18.031 --> 38:20.333
THERE'S NOTHING
BELOW 10 MILLION.

38:20.367 --> 38:23.636
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.
CALL ME BACK.

38:23.670 --> 38:27.307
[sighs]
SO NICE AND COOL IN THERE.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.743
YOU SHOULD TRY IT,
COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

38:29.776 --> 38:31.878
NOW, ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS WAIT NOW.

38:31.911 --> 38:35.181
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO,
YOU AND ME TOGETHER.

38:37.384 --> 38:38.518
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE FUNNY THING IS?

38:38.551 --> 38:41.054
FREDRIK ALWAYS TOLD ME
NOT TO TRUST YOU.

38:41.054 --> 38:42.622
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A THREAT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:42.655 --> 38:43.957
[bleep] FREDRIK.
[laughter]

38:52.699 --> 38:54.067
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET A DRINK.

38:54.067 --> 38:55.602
WE'LL START WITH FOUR SHOTS
OF PATRON, PLEASE.

38:55.635 --> 38:56.836
- SURE.
- FOUR SHOTS OF PATRON?

38:56.870 --> 38:58.071
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.072
- [laughs]

38:59.072 --> 39:00.040
SO RYAN CALLS ME
AND TELLS ME

39:00.073 --> 39:01.041
THAT HIS DEAL WITH JANET
WENT THROUGH

39:01.074 --> 39:02.709
AND THAT HE WANTS
TO CELEBRATE.

39:02.742 --> 39:05.111
<i>- SALUD.</i>
<i>- SALUD.</i>

39:05.145 --> 39:07.113
- I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
BECAUSE THROUGH THIS PROCESS,

39:07.147 --> 39:11.151
RYAN HAS SHOWN ME THAT HE IS...
NOT ALWAYS AN [bleep].

39:11.184 --> 39:13.153
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR DEAL, MAN.

39:13.186 --> 39:14.621
- THANK YOU.
BUT YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY,

39:14.654 --> 39:15.889
RIGHT?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

39:15.922 --> 39:19.359
- YEAH. SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOMETHING, OKAY,

39:19.392 --> 39:21.528
AND THIS IS FOR YOU.

39:21.561 --> 39:24.197
THIS IS FOR SHOWING ME
THAT APARTMENT.

39:25.231 --> 39:26.866
- WOW.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.536
- IT'S $20,000.
YOU DESERVE IT.

39:29.569 --> 39:30.737
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN THAT SITUATION

39:30.770 --> 39:32.038
IF IT WERE NOT FOR YOU.

39:32.072 --> 39:34.674
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- YEAH.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.243
- I HAVE TO ADMIT
YOU HAVE IMPRESSED ME, MAN,

39:37.277 --> 39:38.912
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THIS.

39:38.945 --> 39:40.580
- LISTEN,
IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING,

39:40.613 --> 39:44.351
IT'S ABOUT HAVING CLOSE TIES
WITH THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE

39:44.384 --> 39:46.052
WHO I KNOW ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.053
I'M GONNA BE GOOD TO THEM
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

39:47.053 --> 39:49.155
- THIS IS A SIDE OF YOU
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN.

39:49.189 --> 39:51.091
I HAVE TO ADMIT.
- LISTEN,

39:51.124 --> 39:53.259
I SPENT MY FIRST THREE YEARS
IN THIS BUSINESS

39:53.293 --> 39:56.196
JUST GETTING TOTALLY
[bleep] OVER BY PEOPLE.

39:56.229 --> 39:58.064
- I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW
WHAT THE FUNNY THING IS?

39:58.098 --> 40:01.001
FREDRIK ALWAYS TOLD ME
NOT TO TRUST YOU,

40:01.034 --> 40:06.072
AND NOW I'M STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND...

40:06.106 --> 40:07.674
WHY.

40:07.707 --> 40:10.010
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A THREAT.

40:10.043 --> 40:12.345
- WOW,
WHAT A PIECE OF [bleep].

40:12.379 --> 40:13.947
YOU KNOW WHAT?
[bleep] FREDRIK.

40:13.980 --> 40:15.715
[phone ringing]

40:15.749 --> 40:17.250

40:20.453 --> 40:22.188
- IT'S GOOD ENERGY.
- NO.

40:22.222 --> 40:23.790
- DO IT!
- I WON'T DO IT.

40:23.823 --> 40:25.925
- WAIT, I GOT TO--SHH.
- OKAY.

40:25.959 --> 40:27.894
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

40:30.296 --> 40:31.998
HMM, INTERESTING.

40:32.032 --> 40:34.834
IN TWO HOURS,
THEY'RE PULLING OUT.

40:34.868 --> 40:36.236
OKAY. GOOD-BYE.

40:37.704 --> 40:42.008
ARE YOU READY?
- SHOULD I?

40:42.042 --> 40:46.012
- 4,250,000.

40:46.046 --> 40:47.614
[clinks glasses]

40:49.549 --> 40:50.684
- GOOD JOB.

40:50.717 --> 40:52.886
- CAN YOU SMILE?
- I THOUGHT I WAS.

40:52.919 --> 40:56.056
- NO, THAT'S NOT A SMILE.
- OH.

40:56.089 --> 40:57.691
- TEETH.
- OKAY.

40:57.724 --> 40:58.892
WE HAVE A DEAL.
- WE HAVE A DEAL?

40:58.925 --> 41:00.260
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

41:00.293 --> 41:02.328
- CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CHING!
IT FEELS SO GOOD.

41:02.362 --> 41:05.065
I'VE SET A LOT OF RECORDS
IN MANY DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS,

41:05.065 --> 41:06.399
AND NOW, PARK SLOPE.

41:06.433 --> 41:09.336
CHECK THAT BOX OFF,
AND I LOVE THAT.

41:09.369 --> 41:13.540
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'VE CEMENTED
A NEW RELATIONSHIP

WITH ANOTHER DEVELOPER.

41:15.141 --> 41:16.276

41:27.487 --> 41:29.556
YES.
[laughs]

41:29.589 --> 41:30.757
- THE NIGHT'S JUST
GETTING STARTED.

41:30.790 --> 41:31.991
YOU STILL HAVE YOUR CLOTHES ON.

41:32.092 --> 41:32.959
- ARE YOU TRYING
TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF?

41:32.992 --> 41:34.194
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

41:34.227 --> 41:37.097
DON'T MAKE THIS A WEIRD THING.
- [laughs]

41:37.097 --> 41:40.133
OH, MY GOD. TELL ME THE TRUTH.
IS THIS YOUR NATURAL HAIR?

41:40.166 --> 41:42.535
DO YOU DYE IT GRAY?
- NO, I DON'T DYE MY HAIR GRAY.

41:42.569 --> 41:44.371

I MEAN, YOU LOOK GREAT.

41:44.404 --> 41:46.740

[laughter]

41:52.212 --> 41:53.747
HOLY [bleep].

41:53.780 --> 41:57.017
RYAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON THAN WHAT I EXPECTED.

41:57.117 --> 42:00.220
HE FEELS THE NEED OF ALWAYS
BEING, LIKE, DEMEANING,

42:00.253 --> 42:02.155
AND, LIKE, ALWAYS ON TOP,
AND, LIKE, "I'M ANGRY,

42:02.188 --> 42:04.357
AND I CAN NEGOTIATE,"
BUT YOU CAN ALSO TELL

42:04.391 --> 42:07.060
THAT HE IS KIND OF A KID
INSIDE...

42:07.093 --> 42:08.228
[laughter]

42:08.261 --> 42:11.064
AND MAYBE HE'S NEVER BEEN
ALLOWED TO BE HIMSELF.

42:11.064 --> 42:14.868
I DON'T FEEL LIKE RYAN KNOWS
WHO HE IS JUST YET,

42:14.901 --> 42:18.405
BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN
FINDING OUT WHO THAT PERSON IS.

42:18.438 --> 42:21.074
- IN GOING FORWARD, YOU AND I,
WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

42:21.074 --> 42:23.910

I MEAN THAT.
