00:02.754 --> 00:04.673
<i>Bad guys in this town are changing.</i>

00:13.556 --> 00:14.599
Hi.

00:22.941 --> 00:23.942
Welcome, everyone.

00:24.109 --> 00:27.737
The world sees criminal lunatics.
I see brilliance.

00:27.904 --> 00:30.281
Theo Galavan, the new mayor of Gotham!

00:31.074 --> 00:32.617
No! Mother.

00:32.784 --> 00:34.119
<i>Any last words?</i>

00:34.285 --> 00:35.704
<i>I am going to kill you.</i>

00:37.580 --> 00:39.040
<i>They're going to pay
for what they've done.</i>

00:39.791 --> 00:41.000
Hello, Jim. Please step aside.

00:43.128 --> 00:46.256
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

00:46.423 --> 00:49.134
- You're under arrest.
- No! Tell me who killed them!

00:49.300 --> 00:50.468
Hello, sleepyhead.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.053
My mother was a saint!

00:52.220 --> 00:54.264
A man with nothing to love is free.

00:54.514 --> 00:56.683
<i>Silver is bad news, Bruce.</i>

00:57.142 --> 01:01.354
What are you doing? Stop!
Malone! It's Malone. That's the name.

01:01.521 --> 01:02.564
Goodbye, Silver.

01:02.731 --> 01:04.899
Bruce, you can't do this. It isn't you.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.152
<i>That's what you think.
But you're wrong.</i>

01:07.318 --> 01:10.530
<i>You're right about my uncle.
He's everything everyone says.</i>

01:12.282 --> 01:13.491
<i>I don't know how bad it's gonna get.</i>

01:13.658 --> 01:15.452
There is no line. There's just the law.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.620
<i>Jim, you see an abyss,
and you run toward it.</i>

01:17.787 --> 01:19.038
I'm pregnant.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.167
<i>We need every method at our disposal.</i>

01:22.333 --> 01:25.128
<i>If there was ever a time for us
to work together, now is that time.</i>

01:25.295 --> 01:26.546
<i>Gotham needs him dead!</i>

01:26.713 --> 01:29.424
<i>Think of the greater good.
Think of Gotham.</i>

01:29.591 --> 01:31.009
Goodbye, Jim Gordon.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.183
After searching the premises,

01:38.349 --> 01:42.353
I, along with Alfred Pennyworth
and Selina Kyle,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.523
was able to locate the abductee,
Bruce Wayne.

01:45.690 --> 01:46.691
Where was he?

01:46.858 --> 01:48.276
Theo Galavan's residence.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.236
- That's when you opened fire?
- Yes.

01:50.695 --> 01:54.616
<i>We eliminated the threat posed
by Father Creel and his men,</i>

01:54.783 --> 01:56.701
and were able to recover Bruce Wayne.

01:57.952 --> 01:58.995
Sacrilege!

02:01.748 --> 02:04.751
You then left to search
for Galavan on your own?

02:04.918 --> 02:06.252
That's correct.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.129
<i>Did you find him?</i>

02:08.296 --> 02:09.380
Yes.

02:10.048 --> 02:13.510
Theo Galavan, you're under arrest.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.720
<i>- Did you detain Galavan?</i>
- No.

02:16.012 --> 02:17.055
Why not?

02:19.641 --> 02:24.062
Captain Barnes and Officer Vargas arrived
and placed me under arrest.

02:24.479 --> 02:29.025
Jim. Jim! Put your gun on the ground
and put your hands on top of your head.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.568
That's because at the time
of this incident,

02:30.735 --> 02:32.904
some four weeks ago,
you were a fugitive from the law.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.739
That was a misunderstanding.

02:38.535 --> 02:39.661
What happened next?

02:39.828 --> 02:44.165
Oswald Cobblepot
and two of his associates arrived,

02:44.332 --> 02:47.043
<i>rendered Officer Vargas
and Captain Barnes unconscious.</i>

02:50.964 --> 02:54.092
Cobblepot and his associates
escaped with Galavan.

02:54.759 --> 02:58.763
Are you 100% sure that he won't beat this
and walk free again?

03:00.265 --> 03:03.101
<i>You then pursued Cobblepot
and his men, correct?</i>

03:05.478 --> 03:07.772
Yes, but I was unable to locate them.

03:07.981 --> 03:11.067
You're a man of conscience, Jim.
You'll regret this.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.737
I have many regrets.
This won't be top of the list.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.740
At which point you decided
to flee the city

03:17.907 --> 03:19.450
before law enforcement could question you?

03:19.617 --> 03:21.619
<i>Yes. For that, I have no excuse,</i>

03:22.036 --> 03:24.163
other than to say

03:24.330 --> 03:26.749
I was concerned
for the safety of my fiancÃ©e.

03:27.709 --> 03:32.130
She had informed me earlier that day
that she was pregnant.

03:32.839 --> 03:34.007
Congratulations.

03:34.674 --> 03:35.967
Thank you.

03:37.760 --> 03:42.265
Detective Gordon,
within hours of your encounter,

03:42.432 --> 03:45.977
Theo Galavan was found beaten
and shot to death.

03:46.519 --> 03:49.480
<i>Were you present
at the time of his murder?</i>

03:50.356 --> 03:52.317
Oh, well. Here we are.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.653
No, I was not.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.614
Do you have any information
regarding the case

03:57.780 --> 03:59.324
that you have not shared with us?

03:59.574 --> 04:00.867
This is for my mother.

04:04.704 --> 04:05.872
No, I do not.

04:06.039 --> 04:10.084
Detective, did you have anything to do
with the murder of Theo Galavan?

04:15.924 --> 04:17.592
<i>Detective, answer the question.</i>

04:19.969 --> 04:22.263
Were you involved
in Theo Galavan's murder?

04:24.557 --> 04:26.017
No, I was not.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.533
Charges are lifted.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.329
I'm cleared of all wrong-doing
and reinstated.

04:47.372 --> 04:49.207
I knew they would see sense.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.210
I didn't.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.545
You told the truth.
What choice did they have?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.047
Yeah.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.096
Are you sure this is what you want?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.098
After everything
this job has put us through?

05:06.641 --> 05:07.976
Positive.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.104
Then what's wrong?

05:11.270 --> 05:13.189
Nothing. Long day.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.108
Promise?

05:15.274 --> 05:16.401
Promise.

05:19.988 --> 05:21.322
Barnes.

05:21.823 --> 05:22.907
Dent.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.202
Captivating story.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.954
Yes, it was.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.165
Do you believe him?

05:32.417 --> 05:37.797
I believe your investigation has found
no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

05:37.964 --> 05:40.800
Careful. You're starting
to sound like a lawyer.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.970
Any leads on Cobblepot?

05:44.470 --> 05:47.932
His men have deserted him. He's all alone.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.393
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.280
<i>It's now day 27 of the manhunt</i>

06:02.447 --> 06:04.782
<i>for the crime lord, Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

06:04.949 --> 06:05.950
<i>G.C.P.D. officers</i>

06:06.117 --> 06:08.911
<i>continue to comb the city
in search of the man they say</i>

06:09.078 --> 06:12.248
<i>killed controversial mayor Theo Galavan
in cold blood.</i>

06:12.415 --> 06:15.626
<i>With public enemy number one on the lam,
the question remains,</i>

06:15.793 --> 06:18.629
<i>just who is running Gotham's underworld?</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:27.722
Take him away.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.570
Hello, Butch.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.660
Hey. How you doin'?

06:50.286 --> 06:51.579
Your security stinks.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.791
People are usually trying to get out
of this place, not in.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.880
Why so glum?
You're the king of Gotham now.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.218
I'm not glum. I'm just thinking.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.053
I got a lot of responsibilities.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.013
Not as much fun
as you thought it'd be, huh?

07:10.348 --> 07:11.349
Yeah.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.185
What do you want, anyway?

07:14.352 --> 07:16.437
You got a lot of nerve showing up
after what you did to me.

07:16.687 --> 07:17.730
Ooh.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.066
Is that your mean face?

07:21.109 --> 07:23.236
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

07:23.861 --> 07:24.987
Maybe I will.

07:27.657 --> 07:30.535
What I did for you, Butch,
is make you a free man.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.412
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be king.

07:34.205 --> 07:37.875
I bet that was your plan all along, huh?
You're just that fond of me.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.797
Strangely enough,
I am kind of fond of you.

07:43.381 --> 07:46.717
I mean, normally, I go for handsome,
intelligent men, not brutes,

07:47.385 --> 07:52.306
but you have an amazing animal vitality
about you.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.933
I'm smarter than I look.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.476
Oh, you must be.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.896
A funny lady.
What do you really want?

08:03.359 --> 08:05.194
I wanna be your partner in crime.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.573
Lonely, huh?

08:11.075 --> 08:13.077
You and I would make a good team.

08:14.162 --> 08:16.122
I'm not looking
for a relationship right now.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.541
Honeybun, look at me.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.631
We have history.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.760
And you and I both know,
deep down in your heart,

08:29.927 --> 08:31.512
that whatever I want,

08:32.930 --> 08:33.973
you want.

08:47.195 --> 08:48.237
<i>All units, all units,</i>

08:48.404 --> 08:51.115
<i>reported armed abduction near
the 300 block of Kearny Avenue.</i>

08:51.282 --> 08:54.410
<i>Any and all available officers
in the area, please respond.</i>

09:01.334 --> 09:02.835
G.C.P.D.

09:03.127 --> 09:04.587
Is there a problem, Officer?

09:04.754 --> 09:06.672
There's been an abduction in the area.

09:07.215 --> 09:08.216
How awful.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.717
<i>Have you seen anything tonight?</i>

09:09.967 --> 09:11.385
Anything out of the ordinary?

09:12.678 --> 09:14.222
No. Can't say that I have.

09:14.931 --> 09:16.432
Do you live in the area, sir?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.643
- Not far.
- What's your address?

09:23.439 --> 09:27.318
Well, what I mean to say,
I used to live in the area. I moved.

09:27.902 --> 09:30.321
Would you open
the back of the van, please, sir?

09:31.614 --> 09:32.907
Sure thing.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.159
Happy to.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.622
What the--

10:25.459 --> 10:27.336
<i>Somebody get me a glass of water!</i>

10:30.381 --> 10:32.883
<i>Hey! Mitch, separate those two.</i>

10:39.807 --> 10:43.227
It's a good thing you're here.
We caught a weird one last night.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.564
That's it? No hug? No kiss?
No welcome back?

10:46.731 --> 10:48.482
You don't deserve these lips.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.195
Way I see it, you finagled yourself
a month-long, paid vacation, you bastard.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.740
Besides, Captain's pressing me
on this case.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.408
Oh, yeah? What is it?

10:57.575 --> 10:58.743
You didn't hear?

10:59.201 --> 11:02.496
Last night, some psycho froze a cop
to death.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.914
Froze her?

11:04.081 --> 11:07.335
Yeah. Told you it was weird. Come on.
Nygma's waiting for us.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.505
Frozen.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.020
Interesting. It took nearly five seconds
to freeze this rose

11:26.187 --> 11:28.022
- using liquid nitrogen.
- So?

11:28.189 --> 11:30.107
Well, so, it'd take a human body
significantly longer,

11:30.274 --> 11:32.276
depending on mass and body fat, of course.

11:32.443 --> 11:35.446
So why would a cop stand around
for hours waiting to get frozen?

11:35.613 --> 11:37.156
She wouldn't.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.825
Which means your suspect
wasn't using liquid nitrogen.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.620
He was using super-cooled liquid helium.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.456
It's one of the most effective substances
in the world

11:45.623 --> 11:47.208
for rapid temperature reduction.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.710
This liquid helium, where do you get it?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.295
Why do you need it?

11:51.545 --> 11:52.797
He doesn't, dummy.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.967
He just wants to know where it comes from
so we can track down the guy

11:57.134 --> 11:58.260
that blasted our colleague with it.

12:02.098 --> 12:04.975
I don't like
being called names, Detective.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.146
Easy, Ed.
I'm sure Harvey was just being colorful.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.439
Yeah.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.151
I was just being colorful, Ed, I'm sorry.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.531
It's extremely rare and expensive.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.659
Can't imagine there's more
than one or two producers in Gotham.

12:21.951 --> 12:24.286
I could research manufacturers,
if you would like.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.831
That'll be really nice. Thank you, Ed.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.504
You coming?

12:33.712 --> 12:35.214
Uh, gimme a minute.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.350
Listen, Ed, there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.601
- Penguin.
- Yes.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.895
You want to know
the nature of my relationship with him.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.147
Yes.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.399
Because you're concerned I aided
and abetted a known criminal.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.359
Did you?

12:55.860 --> 13:00.781
I found Mr. Cobblepot wounded
and dying in the woods.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.367
I nursed him back to health.

13:03.534 --> 13:07.955
He owed me his life which is why I trusted
him when he said he had changed his ways.

13:08.706 --> 13:10.207
It was an innocent mistake.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.209
<i>Got him! We got him!</i>

13:12.376 --> 13:13.711
Wonder what that is.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.888
Silence!

13:26.056 --> 13:28.309
What are you, a bunch of cheerleaders?

13:28.601 --> 13:31.729
This is not a game! This is our job!

13:32.730 --> 13:39.320
And this specimen,
this is just one sad, pathetic skell.

13:40.029 --> 13:42.072
<i>There are plenty of scumbags out there.</i>

13:42.364 --> 13:43.491
Plenty.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.537
So stop waving your pom-poms
and go catch some!

13:49.914 --> 13:52.583
Yes, stare all you want. Big whoop.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.629
<i>- You got me. I'm cool.</i>
<i>- Get in there!</i>

13:57.129 --> 13:58.714
It's all good.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.221
I said I'd catch him, and I did.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.430
Yes, sir.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.517
Now we'll learn the truth
of what really happened to Galavan.

14:30.079 --> 14:31.789
All right, Cobblepot.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.299
Tell me what happened at Galavan's
that night.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.302
Well, a lot of things happened.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.179
Why don't you start with the moment

14:47.346 --> 14:50.015
right after you knocked me out
with that vase.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.727
I'm sorry for that.
Such an exquisite vase.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.147
This is my amused look.

14:58.274 --> 14:59.525
<i>Keep talking.</i>

14:59.692 --> 15:01.527
I took Galavan to the river
and I killed him.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.154
Slowly.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.781
You confess to murder?

15:05.948 --> 15:08.075
Yes, I do. Proud of it.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.327
I'm not a criminal, you know.

15:10.828 --> 15:14.039
I'm just insane.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.003
- What did James Gordon do?
- What did he do when?

15:19.169 --> 15:21.255
What did he do after you knocked me out?

15:21.422 --> 15:22.673
What does he say he did?

15:23.674 --> 15:24.758
I'm asking you.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.818
You have something you wanna tell me?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.238
No, sir.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.246
Cobblepot backed your story.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.249
You mean, he told the truth.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.751
Yeah.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.545
That's what I'm gonna choose to believe.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.714
It's the right thing to do.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.385
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back, sir.

16:09.011 --> 16:13.057
Jim, I'm trusting you.
Don't make a fool out of me.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.685
Yes, sir.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.577
I was having a dream about you.

17:20.958 --> 17:24.962
We were at that little red cabin
by the beach. Remember?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.841
I remember. Six summers ago.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.344
You looked like a movie star.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.140
You look tired.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.558
Work.

17:38.517 --> 17:39.893
How's it coming?

17:40.853 --> 17:44.898
Good. Good.
Slower than I'd like, but good.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.483
Tell me.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.779
I'm having trouble with reanimation.

17:52.239 --> 17:57.244
I need to find the correct ratio of
liquid helium to glycerol cryoprotectant.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.663
Now tell me what that means
in English, honey.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.792
It means

18:04.835 --> 18:06.795
I can freeze you, like we planned.

18:07.463 --> 18:10.174
I can bring your temperature down
to 200 degrees below zero,

18:10.466 --> 18:12.718
and I can stop this disease
from killing you.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.136
But?

18:16.430 --> 18:17.556
I can't bring you back.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.312
Not yet. But I will.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.066
I'm sorry.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.401
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

18:30.152 --> 18:32.863
I'm just thinking of all those poor mice
you're experimenting on.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.117
They don't feel anything.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.289
I just need more time. A little more time.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.707
Hey.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.169
I'll find a way. I promise.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.307
- Got some good news and bad news.
- Good news.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.768
Nygma did some digging and found
one company in all of Gotham

19:02.935 --> 19:05.103
that makes liquid helium.
Wayne Enterprises.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.897
- That's the good news?
- It's not,

19:07.064 --> 19:09.983
but I thought bad news and more bad news
didn't have the same ring.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.151
What's this?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.904
Three abductions in the past month
all tied to a blue van,

19:14.071 --> 19:15.948
same as our suspect's.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.492
Three abductions? They find any of 'em?

19:18.659 --> 19:19.993
Not a one.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.622
Which makes you wonder what's this guy
doing with all those people.

19:28.502 --> 19:32.214
Nora? I'm going to work for a few hours.
Knock if you need anything.

19:32.381 --> 19:33.590
Okay.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.639
Psst.

20:25.434 --> 20:26.476
Psst.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.020
- Ed?
- Shh.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.980
Don't look at me.
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.110
You doing okay? You look kind of funky.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.113
I confess I've felt better.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.326
Is there anything I can do to help?

20:43.035 --> 20:44.620
<i>I'm beyond help.</i>

20:45.495 --> 20:47.289
Forget me, my friend.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.878
But if you would take care
of my mother's grave,

20:53.045 --> 20:54.630
I'd be very grateful.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.886
If you'd visit occasionally,
tell her I'm thinking of her.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.554
I will.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.891
She likes lilies.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.062
Occasional visits, lilies, check.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.899
Thank you.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.818
On your feet, Cobblepot.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.781
What's going on? Where are you taking me?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.325
Arkham. You are insane, right?

21:29.831 --> 21:33.961
It is now Thursday,
February 21st, 2:44 p.m.

21:34.795 --> 21:39.132
Test subject 014 is in his 40s,
appears to be in good health,

21:39.299 --> 21:42.344
and shows no signs of damage sustained
during vitrification.

21:42.928 --> 21:46.682
I'm now ready to commence
the reanimation experiment.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.320
<i>You are correct.</i>

22:00.612 --> 22:02.990
Wayne Enterprises does manufacture
liquid helium.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.784
For years it was used
as part of our cryogenics program.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.077
Cryo-whatics?

22:07.244 --> 22:10.080
It's the branch of physics dealing
with the production and effects

22:10.247 --> 22:11.790
of extremely low temperatures.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.460
My understanding is that
there were some promising experiments

22:15.627 --> 22:17.546
being carried out in the program.

22:17.713 --> 22:19.256
But, alas, it was shut down.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.841
When was that?

22:22.092 --> 22:23.635
Two or three years ago.

22:23.802 --> 22:27.931
Thomas Wayne killed it,
along with a few other odd programs.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.433
Any idea why?

22:29.933 --> 22:33.145
No idea. It was all kept very quiet.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.189
Thanks, Lucius.

22:36.565 --> 22:37.774
Detectives.

23:09.139 --> 23:11.808
Penguin pie!

23:24.279 --> 23:25.822
There seems to be some confusion.

23:27.032 --> 23:30.035
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

23:31.078 --> 23:34.164
Many of you, no doubt,
will have heard of me.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.377
Some of you, clearly, have not.

23:40.796 --> 23:44.883
For those poor ignorant souls,
I offer illumination.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.470
I am not a man to be trifled with.
No.

23:51.098 --> 23:56.895
I am powerful. I am vicious.
I'm King of Gotham.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.193
I am King of Gotham!

24:04.903 --> 24:06.571
I'm the King of Gotham!

24:08.323 --> 24:09.533
I am! I am!

24:16.915 --> 24:20.544
Look at me! I'm the King of Gotham!

24:20.710 --> 24:25.048
I'm King! I'm King! Here ye, here ye!

24:52.534 --> 24:55.245
The subject's core temperature
is now 39 degrees.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.289
We are approaching the critical threshold.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.300
41 degrees.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.677
We hit 41 degrees.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.930
Solution A14, I knew it would work,
I knew it!

25:15.265 --> 25:16.266
Ha!

25:17.184 --> 25:19.102
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

25:24.441 --> 25:25.609
No.

25:26.318 --> 25:29.738
No, no, no, no. Not again, please.
Not again, no.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.434
<i>Nora?</i>

26:00.769 --> 26:02.479
Breathe, Nora. I'm right here. Look at me.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.566
Where's the formoterol?

26:24.834 --> 26:26.419
That was the worst one yet.

26:30.799 --> 26:33.510
That was the last pill.
Why didn't you tell me?

26:35.178 --> 26:40.267
I'm sorry. I forgot. I have so many.
There's so many.

26:41.893 --> 26:44.437
If you have another attack
and you don't have this medication,

26:44.604 --> 26:47.023
you could die.
You can't let this happen again, Nora.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.859
Why does it matter?

26:52.487 --> 26:54.072
It matters.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.206
I'll be back.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.596
I need to get this refilled.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.315
Next.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.358
I need to get this refilled.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.402
Do you have the prescription?

27:32.569 --> 27:33.737
I have the bottle.

27:34.612 --> 27:37.073
That's not the same thing, is it?

27:38.074 --> 27:39.242
Please. I just need it refilled.

27:40.243 --> 27:43.079
The original prescription
doesn't have a refill order.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.874
If it doesn't have a refill order
I can't refill it.

27:47.250 --> 27:51.171
This medication is for my wife.
She's sick. She's in pain.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.717
Everyone that comes in here is sick
or in pain.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.888
Have your doctor write a new prescription,
then I can refill it.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.267
Just give me the medication.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.648
- No.
- You son of a bitch!

28:10.815 --> 28:12.442
Get out! Get him outta here!

28:12.609 --> 28:15.111
Get outta here before I call the cops,
you kook!

28:17.739 --> 28:20.492
You shouldn't have done that.
I'll be back.

28:31.378 --> 28:32.962
Goodbye, Nigel.

28:33.505 --> 28:38.385
Oh, and remember what I told you.
See no evil, do no evil.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.304
Yes, sir. I will.

28:46.142 --> 28:49.896
Mr. Cobblepot. My name is Hugo Strange.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.651
Chief of Psychiatry here at Arkham Asylum.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.945
Please come in.

29:06.704 --> 29:07.831
<i>You're not listening.</i>

29:07.997 --> 29:10.041
Maybe you should get a new hearing aid
while you're here.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.334
Hey!

29:18.508 --> 29:21.553
- Formoterol. Now!
- Okay. Okay.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.014
Take it all.

29:26.474 --> 29:29.811
Please, don't kill me. Please.
I'll do anything you want.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.856
You and your friend here

29:35.108 --> 29:36.443
are going to help save my wife.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.694
No! No!

29:49.289 --> 29:50.582
Excuse me!

29:51.249 --> 29:52.876
Going to need some help out.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.296
Yeah?

29:58.173 --> 29:59.507
Our guy just hit a pharmacy on 9th.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.179
<i>That's it.
Just slide him in there.</i>

30:05.597 --> 30:07.390
Hey, careful.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.061
Blue van.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.734
- Go, get out of here.
- Thank you.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.364
- Go, go, go, go!
- I got it, I got it!

30:24.991 --> 30:26.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

30:50.016 --> 30:52.477
What is this, anyhow? Am I being punished?

30:52.644 --> 30:54.062
No.

30:54.646 --> 30:58.316
I make it a point to meet all new inmates.
It's part of the intake protocol.

30:58.483 --> 31:01.778
Though I will ask you to refrain
from making speeches

31:01.945 --> 31:05.114
atop cafeteria tables in the future.

31:06.407 --> 31:07.617
I'll do my best.

31:08.618 --> 31:10.703
How has your adjustment been so far?

31:12.121 --> 31:13.873
Fine, I suppose.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.251
Oh, come now, Oswald.

31:16.751 --> 31:20.630
Periods of great transition
can bring on great stress.

31:21.297 --> 31:24.717
Surely this must be a traumatic experience
for you.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.387
Please.

31:32.642 --> 31:35.103
This is a pillow fight
compared to what I've been through.

31:35.270 --> 31:40.275
Yes. I have read
of your tribulations of late.

31:41.067 --> 31:45.822
Attempts on your life,
having to survive being a fugitive.

31:53.496 --> 31:54.914
The death of your mother.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.630
Troubled times.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.841
Is that your clinical diagnosis?

32:05.466 --> 32:11.180
I know that if I were in your position,
I would be feeling some strong emotions.

32:11.598 --> 32:15.351
Anger, grief, regret even.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.687
For what?

32:19.772 --> 32:22.025
The murder of Theo Galavan.

32:22.984 --> 32:26.279
My mother died in my arms
because of Galavan.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.657
The only thing I regret is that I couldn't
kill him more than once.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.117
I see.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.706
Perhaps we could pick it up
right there next time.

32:37.915 --> 32:41.711
I so look forward to our work together.
And don't worry.

32:42.211 --> 32:45.840
Here at Arkham, we have a number
of intensive treatment programs.

32:46.966 --> 32:52.680
I am more than confident that we'll be
able to facilitate your rehabilitation.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.768
My what?

32:57.560 --> 32:58.978
Rehabilitation.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.898
That's why you're here, after all.

33:02.732 --> 33:04.233
To be cured of your sickness.

33:06.027 --> 33:09.822
You are sick, aren't you?

33:53.700 --> 33:54.992
Victor?

34:00.123 --> 34:01.249
Victor?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.086
Victor?

34:12.135 --> 34:15.805
Honey? You down here?

34:19.350 --> 34:20.685
Victor?

34:37.160 --> 34:40.663
My God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.670
Surveillance system wasn't even on.
What's that?

34:47.837 --> 34:49.964
Some witnesses saw our guy
throw this at the pharmacist.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.674
It's probably his prescription bottle.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.302
"Fries, Nora Fries." His wife, maybe?

34:54.469 --> 34:55.845
Yeah, maybe, but it's "Fries."

34:56.137 --> 34:57.805
- What do you mean?
- It's pronounced "Fries."

34:57.972 --> 34:59.515
- How do you know?
- I'm really good with names.

34:59.682 --> 35:02.643
Yeah, whatever. There's an address
on here. Come on, let's go.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.655
G.C.P.D., we have a search warrant!

35:24.707 --> 35:26.209
<i>Ma'am, don't move.</i>

35:27.585 --> 35:28.920
Holy moly.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.345
He told me they were mice.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.852
Get her out of here.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.189
Ms. Fries.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.842
Nora.

36:45.955 --> 36:49.208
You all right? Nigel?

36:53.087 --> 36:55.923
See no evil, do no evil.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.469
See no evil, do no evil.

37:02.138 --> 37:03.306
No, no.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.850
See no evil, do no evil.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.483
We need to find your husband, Nora.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.694
Before he hurts someone else.

37:16.986 --> 37:18.195
I was asleep.

37:19.614 --> 37:23.659
I woke up when I heard him leave.
That's all I can tell you.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.080
If you don't cooperate, we'll be forced
to charge you with obstruction of justice.

37:28.915 --> 37:31.834
You're going to jail, Nora.
You get that, right?

37:34.587 --> 37:36.505
My husband did terrible things.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.676
But he did those terrible things
for my sake.

37:43.346 --> 37:46.390
I'm dying. He wants to save me.

37:48.768 --> 37:50.686
<i>I can't tell you how sorry I am.</i>

37:51.979 --> 37:53.856
But I can't betray him.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.868
Oh, one more thing.

38:06.202 --> 38:08.704
What's the correct pronunciation
of your last name?

38:09.747 --> 38:10.998
It's Fries.

38:11.624 --> 38:13.542
Fries. Thank you.

38:14.752 --> 38:16.045
Told you.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.594
Excuse me.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.805
Yeah, what can I help you with?

39:07.972 --> 39:11.058
I'd like to speak
with Detective Gordon, please.

39:11.225 --> 39:12.351
What for?

39:12.893 --> 39:15.062
I'd like to make a confession.

39:18.482 --> 39:20.943
I'm the man that's been freezing people.

39:23.946 --> 39:25.156
You too, huh?

39:25.489 --> 39:29.201
That makes five in one night.
Must be a full moon.

39:29.744 --> 39:32.705
Tell you what.
Why don't you have a seat with the others.

39:33.289 --> 39:34.832
Detective Gordon,
he'll be out in a minute.

39:34.999 --> 39:38.377
- No, no. You don't understand. I'm--
- I understand. Have a seat.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.454
Huh.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.501
Am I dead?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.087
Hello?

40:25.257 --> 40:26.425
Hello?

40:28.803 --> 40:30.346
Am I dead?

40:32.098 --> 40:34.058
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
- Take it easy, come on! Down!

40:34.225 --> 40:36.560
A16. It worked.

40:37.103 --> 40:38.437
Go get a blanket.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.523
I can't believe it worked.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.359
All right. I got him.

40:43.818 --> 40:44.819
I got him.

40:45.361 --> 40:47.738
<i>You? You!</i>

40:53.369 --> 40:55.830
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

41:26.944 --> 41:33.909
New inmate Oswald Cobblepot exhibits signs
of extreme narcissism and megalomania.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.329
Also seems to have had
a rather unhealthy relationship

41:37.496 --> 41:39.999
with his deceased mother.

41:40.166 --> 41:44.920
Treatments will include immersive aversion
therapy and radical psychotropics.

41:59.435 --> 42:01.854
How are we this evening, Ms. Peabody?

42:02.021 --> 42:05.232
Busy. The formaldehyde pump in silo F
needs replacing.

42:05.733 --> 42:09.778
Our young lady arsonist refuses
to co-operate with our experiments.

42:09.945 --> 42:13.199
And I had to reschedule your appointment
with Councilman Carter.

42:13.365 --> 42:15.284
- Again?
- It's the third time.

42:15.826 --> 42:17.536
- How very rude.
- Indeed.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.206
And there's this.

42:20.372 --> 42:23.792
Seems someone has solved the problem
of post-cryonic reanimation.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.712
Nonsense.
I'm still years from solving that.

42:30.758 --> 42:32.426
Fascinating.

42:32.885 --> 42:36.680
Do you realize what this could mean
for our program? Who is this man?

42:37.306 --> 42:38.974
His name is Victor Fries.

42:39.141 --> 42:42.019
But the newspapers have already
given him a nickname.

42:44.772 --> 42:46.815
Hello, Mr. Freeze.

43:31.527 --> 43:32.528
English SDH
