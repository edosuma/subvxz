01:29.530 --> 01:31.644
I'm sorry, Cody.

02:09.301 --> 02:14.337
I've had a case come back across
my desk that could be a very good fit.

02:14.658 --> 02:17.068
Cody. He's eight.

02:17.198 --> 02:19.582
His birth mother died when he was three.

02:19.682 --> 02:24.207
And we placed him with a couple that...
that turned out weren't fit.

02:24.307 --> 02:26.570
The second couple we
placed him with abandoned him.

02:26.670 --> 02:29.139
- Oh, my God.
- And I went for his annual follow up.

02:29.239 --> 02:31.953
- I found him living alone in the apartment.
- Alone?

02:32.053 --> 02:34.019
For almost a month, we think.

02:34.119 --> 02:37.497
Neighbors called once he started
going door to door.

02:39.306 --> 02:43.120
Look, I like this kid.

02:43.494 --> 02:47.002
We're not supposed to have
opinions like that, but I do.

02:47.102 --> 02:50.176
He's resourceful, he's resilient.

02:50.276 --> 02:52.412
I'm not saying these things
haven't affected him.

02:52.512 --> 02:55.347
- He's guarded, he has sleep issues.
- Of course.

02:55.447 --> 03:00.084
But for all he's been through,
he hasn't let it turn him into a victim.

03:00.953 --> 03:03.749
Which is what made me
think of the two of you.

03:04.749 --> 03:08.799
Now that you've been approved, I think
you'll make wonderful foster parents.

03:08.899 --> 03:11.588
My question for you is...

03:11.688 --> 03:13.313
are you ready for this?

03:23.930 --> 03:26.284
Okay, living room.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.438
We can leave that one.

04:07.294 --> 04:09.503
Are you sure?

04:10.221 --> 04:12.327
Clean slate, you know.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.514
Just that one.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.310
Whatever it was like for her...

04:22.449 --> 04:24.689
they said it was fast.

04:25.870 --> 04:28.771
And she wasn't aware
of what was happening.

04:29.432 --> 04:31.593
It's not nearly as...

04:33.281 --> 04:35.970
bad as I imagined in my head.

04:38.632 --> 04:41.033
And I find comfort in that.

04:42.511 --> 04:44.334
That's very good, Johnny.

04:45.288 --> 04:47.529
Anyone else?

04:49.951 --> 04:53.968
We have decided to bring a child
into our home tomorrow.

04:54.068 --> 04:57.584
- That's wonderful, Jessie. Congratulations.
- Thank you, Peter.

04:57.884 --> 05:00.903
How have you been feeling these days?

05:05.049 --> 05:07.198
I still can't sleep at night very well.

05:07.298 --> 05:09.537
- You still on Ambien?
- Yes.

05:10.038 --> 05:12.371
Insomnia is common.

05:13.867 --> 05:18.163
"Somnia" is Latin for "dreams".

05:18.563 --> 05:22.599
"Insomnia" simply means "no dreams".

05:24.035 --> 05:28.591
And what else is a child, but our dreams?

05:28.974 --> 05:31.959
Our hopes, manifest.

05:34.162 --> 05:37.227
We talked about numbness last week,
something a lot of us has felt.

05:37.327 --> 05:40.660
Yeah, I don't know if I'm doing
any better with that.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.513
I think I am, a little.

05:44.906 --> 05:48.973
But the color hasn't returned
to the world just yet.

05:49.253 --> 05:53.556
How is Mark with this?
We haven't seen him here for awhile.

05:53.656 --> 05:57.803
We always say that people
processes grief differently.

05:58.987 --> 06:03.639
Mark and I have had
different experiences with this.

06:04.356 --> 06:08.593
- Feeling distant from a spouse is...
- Common. Yes.

06:10.135 --> 06:14.465
I just wish I knew how to fix this.

06:15.165 --> 06:18.045
For him, for us.

06:19.992 --> 06:24.495
And I really wish he would continue
coming to group with me because...

06:24.595 --> 06:26.827
it's the only time I feel...

06:26.927 --> 06:29.090
I don't know.

06:29.713 --> 06:31.268
Awake.

09:18.914 --> 09:20.800
You ready?

09:21.708 --> 09:22.970
I think so.

09:26.878 --> 09:29.702
- Hey.
- Let's go say hi.

09:32.219 --> 09:34.513
This is Mr. and Mrs. Hobsen.

09:36.274 --> 09:39.322
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

09:39.422 --> 09:41.502
Good morning.

09:43.398 --> 09:46.031
Good morning. How are you?

09:47.605 --> 09:50.127
Can I take that box for you?

09:50.632 --> 09:54.587
No? Okay. Whatever you want to do, pal.

10:02.127 --> 10:05.405
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

10:08.254 --> 10:11.132
Come on. Come on in.

10:11.232 --> 10:13.292
Here we are.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.909
You don't have to do that.

10:18.358 --> 10:21.024
Shoes make floors dirty.

10:33.212 --> 10:35.754
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

10:35.854 --> 10:38.492
It's all yours, Cody.
Nothing's off limits.

10:38.592 --> 10:41.731
Yeah, come on,
I'll show you my Xbox, or...

10:42.131 --> 10:43.714
or we can get a Wii, I guess.

10:43.814 --> 10:46.466
I'm not sure which one you play.
You play, though, right?

10:46.566 --> 10:48.730
I think Mark's pretty excited
to have someone to play.

10:48.830 --> 10:51.070
You ever played disconnect? Sports thing?

10:51.170 --> 10:54.007
It's got a censor on it,
so there is no controller.

10:54.107 --> 10:55.941
Whatever you do, the little dude does.

10:56.041 --> 10:59.277
You can swing, you can throw,
you can kick.

10:59.377 --> 11:03.751
And the little guy does it. I'll show you.

11:03.851 --> 11:06.337
Great. It's pretty neat.

11:13.487 --> 11:15.305
It doesn't look like much.

11:15.405 --> 11:18.173
We want you to decorate it
the way you like it.

11:18.651 --> 11:20.921
- Really?
- That's right.

11:25.016 --> 11:27.424
We're gonna replace those,
I just throw whatever in a basket,

11:27.524 --> 11:30.017
but you can pick out anything you want.

11:31.127 --> 11:33.620
Cody collects butterflies.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.765
- You do?
- Really?

11:35.865 --> 11:38.226
I love this room.

11:45.068 --> 11:48.584
Remember, it's just the first night.
We are all in this together.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.322
- You okay?
- I like your eyes.

11:56.069 --> 11:59.805
- Thank you.
- They're really pretty.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.889
Let's get some sleep.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.941
Good night, Mrs Hobsen.

12:07.041 --> 12:10.195
Good night, Cody. Sleep tight.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.206
Monarch.

13:08.426 --> 13:11.714
Alright. Here. Alright.

13:11.814 --> 13:14.306
- What's your favorite kind of pizza?
- Pineapple.

13:14.406 --> 13:18.932
Yeah? That's what we're going to have
tonight. Celebrate your brave day.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.787
Let's go. You ready?

13:24.327 --> 13:26.977
So, let's all say, "Welcome, Cody".

13:27.077 --> 13:29.285
Welcome, Cody.

13:29.385 --> 13:32.105
You can take that seat right over there.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.567
Alright, let's open those notebooks.

13:35.885 --> 13:37.911
Everyone ready?

13:38.483 --> 13:42.102
The first word is...

13:50.708 --> 13:53.626
- Everything okay in there?
- I'm fine.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.309
He's fine.

14:00.002 --> 14:02.879
I just wanted to make sure
I can still hear him.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.782
He's fine.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.074
- What's this guy?
- The Blue Morpho.

14:45.174 --> 14:48.662
Sounds like some kind of superhero
or something.

14:50.396 --> 14:53.440
And what is this?
This is like a cocoon or something?

14:53.540 --> 14:58.139
That's a chrysalis.
It keeps them safe till they've grown up.

15:00.013 --> 15:01.916
So, I guess we better go to bed.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.421
Alright.

15:06.710 --> 15:09.696
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, sweetie.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.886
Hey.

15:20.612 --> 15:22.859
So, I was straightening out
for you earlier,

15:22.959 --> 15:26.320
and I accidentally found
some of your stimulants.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.219
Stimulants?

15:28.319 --> 15:30.385
Things that keep you awake.

15:31.394 --> 15:33.936
- I don't like to sleep.
- I know.

15:34.036 --> 15:35.985
But there's nothing for you
to be scared of here.

15:36.085 --> 15:38.731
- Yes, there is.
- What?

15:38.831 --> 15:41.226
The Canker Man.

15:42.613 --> 15:44.130
Who's that?

15:44.230 --> 15:48.736
He comes when I sleep. He eats people.

15:49.597 --> 15:51.513
Well, that's no good.

15:51.763 --> 15:53.893
He ate my mom.

15:59.466 --> 16:02.732
You know, when I was a little girl...

16:03.432 --> 16:07.064
I thought there was a witch
scratching in my window.

16:08.222 --> 16:10.473
But it was just a tree.

16:11.006 --> 16:13.199
The branches had grown a little too long,

16:13.299 --> 16:16.265
and they hit the window
when the wind blew.

16:16.778 --> 16:20.345
Once I knew that,
the witch never came back.

16:21.527 --> 16:26.710
Sometimes scary things go away
when we understand them a little.

16:28.137 --> 16:30.625
Not The Canker Man.

16:31.485 --> 16:36.251
Well, you're in a new home now.
I'm sure he can't find you.

16:36.451 --> 16:40.313
He's always with me, he says so.

16:44.286 --> 16:46.462
You did what you had to do.

16:46.562 --> 16:51.676
You can't let him have a sugar stash,
in the middle of his room, under his bed.

16:51.776 --> 16:55.083
I know, I still feel like
I was trespassing.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.218
No.

16:57.943 --> 17:00.078
You're parenting.

17:05.944 --> 17:08.717
<i>When you came in,
you said something about a ghost.</i>

17:08.817 --> 17:12.160
- <i>There was something.</i>
- <i>What did it look like?</i>

17:12.260 --> 17:16.647
<i>Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.</i>

17:16.748 --> 17:19.502
<i>Weren't you a little frightened
at the time?</i>

17:19.801 --> 17:21.692
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

17:22.092 --> 17:25.128
<i>- That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.</i>
- Jess.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.785
<i>Well, then, doctor, how do you explain
what happened to Lance?</i>

17:27.885 --> 17:30.170
<i>Was that hysteria too?</i>

17:33.328 --> 17:35.390
<i>You better get that checked
in a day or two.</i>

17:35.490 --> 17:37.523
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>

17:44.212 --> 17:46.447
Where do they come from?

17:47.142 --> 17:49.565
Have you ever seen this many?

17:51.189 --> 17:53.294
Do we have any jars?

17:56.939 --> 17:59.464
Butterflies even come out at night?

18:05.351 --> 18:09.770
Maybe there is big pretty moths.

18:15.337 --> 18:17.436
- What?
- It bit me.

18:19.017 --> 18:22.190
- A butterfly bit you?
- No...

18:24.627 --> 18:27.083
Where are they coming from?

18:37.057 --> 18:39.189
I need a lid.

18:47.535 --> 18:49.690
What the hell?

18:51.903 --> 18:54.389
What the hell just happened?

21:21.974 --> 21:24.102
I saw something last night.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.231
I think it was Sean.

21:29.861 --> 21:33.601
I know we have all had those dreams...

21:34.001 --> 21:37.363
and felt like we've seen
our kids out in the world.

21:39.912 --> 21:42.235
But this was different.

21:42.915 --> 21:47.495
And I couldn't help but feel...

21:47.895 --> 21:50.376
that it was because...

21:52.164 --> 21:54.004
Go ahead.

21:58.107 --> 22:01.347
He knows about Cody.

22:02.513 --> 22:05.769
And he's angry with me.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.548
For replacing him?

22:12.305 --> 22:13.863
Yeah.

22:13.963 --> 22:16.900
We talked about something
like this at the beginning,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.458
when Mark wanted to sell the house,

22:19.558 --> 22:23.446
- but you refused because...
- I felt like he was still there.

22:25.912 --> 22:29.140
You said you saw him sometimes.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.074
Yes.

22:34.310 --> 22:35.950
Okay.

22:37.917 --> 22:40.857
The thing you need to understand
about dreams...

22:40.957 --> 22:44.219
even lucid dreams, which can feel
very real while we're having them.

22:44.319 --> 22:47.222
This wasn't a dream. I was awake.

22:47.322 --> 22:51.827
Doesn't matter. If we're suppressing
negative emotions like guilt or fear...

22:51.927 --> 22:55.330
especially for sleep deprived
on top of that,

22:55.430 --> 22:58.842
our subconscious will figure out
a way to process those emotions.

22:59.622 --> 23:01.815
Even if we're awake.

23:01.915 --> 23:06.472
We can even achieve levels
of REM's sleep while we're awake.

23:06.572 --> 23:09.056
It's called "a waking dream".

23:09.156 --> 23:13.405
- It's more common than you think.
- Just felt very real.

23:13.505 --> 23:17.003
Yeah. I'm sure it did.

23:17.612 --> 23:21.498
But waking dreams... any dreams, actually,

23:21.598 --> 23:26.447
are conversations that we're
having with ourselves.

23:26.997 --> 23:31.866
Every character in your dreams
is actually just you.

23:31.966 --> 23:35.641
And when we're trying to bury
uncomfortable emotions,

23:35.741 --> 23:39.769
or ideas, or we feel threatened...

23:39.869 --> 23:45.103
sometimes the only outlet
they have is our subconscious.

23:47.481 --> 23:50.864
It's normal for us to feel haunted,

23:50.964 --> 23:55.907
by our past, by our losses,
by the children we lost.

23:58.555 --> 24:00.885
But, Jessie, no...

24:02.225 --> 24:05.211
Sean is not haunting your home.

24:08.287 --> 24:12.296
The question is what are you
trying to say to yourself?

24:12.996 --> 24:17.446
What unresolved emotions
are struggling to get out?

24:25.268 --> 24:27.248
That's pretty.

24:27.648 --> 24:29.544
It's a monarch.

24:30.044 --> 24:32.302
Don't they have...

24:36.290 --> 24:37.872
I guess so.

24:48.140 --> 24:50.208
Thank God,
where did you find him this time?

24:50.308 --> 24:53.559
He was in the maintenance shed,
which will be locked from now on.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.688
Oh, no. Not your seat.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.736
You know where you're going.

25:12.408 --> 25:14.438
Is this everything?

25:14.838 --> 25:16.866
I'll do a sweep.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.107
Hey, pal.

25:40.269 --> 25:43.737
How you doing? Are you alright?

25:43.837 --> 25:45.926
Who is that?

25:48.016 --> 25:50.133
Well, that's our son.

25:50.835 --> 25:52.917
His name was Sean.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.383
Where is he?

25:58.403 --> 26:01.408
- Well...
- He's in heaven.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.480
That's where my mom is.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.435
Tell me what was she like?

26:13.563 --> 26:16.021
I don't remember her.

26:18.807 --> 26:21.136
How did Sean go to heaven?

26:25.980 --> 26:28.226
We wish he hadn't.

26:29.787 --> 26:32.651
As like I'm sure you wish your mom hadn't.

26:37.325 --> 26:39.587
He looks fun.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.505
<i>Are you in fear of losing your car?
Sounds familiar?</i>

27:07.605 --> 27:10.710

27:10.810 --> 27:13.031

27:35.507 --> 27:38.923
Hey... Jess.

27:39.292 --> 27:41.726
Look who's back.

27:47.794 --> 27:50.356
Where the hell are they coming from?

29:23.902 --> 29:25.443
No.

29:25.543 --> 29:27.187
No.

29:36.261 --> 29:38.247
I'm sorry.

30:27.766 --> 30:29.619
He's real.

30:31.889 --> 30:33.957
You saw him.

30:35.861 --> 30:37.779
Touched him.

30:38.207 --> 30:41.934
I did, I was right there.

30:57.914 --> 30:59.864
I'm sorry.

31:03.212 --> 31:04.435
Why?

31:05.907 --> 31:08.128
My dream.

31:10.823 --> 31:13.022
What do you mean, Cody?

31:13.655 --> 31:16.068
What happens when you dream?

31:19.206 --> 31:21.830
I won't do it again.

31:22.425 --> 31:24.852
Please, don't be mad.

31:25.144 --> 31:29.474
- Oh, hey, pal, we're not...
- Honey, we're not mad.

31:33.251 --> 31:35.981
I hope you have a good day, Jessie.

31:36.781 --> 31:38.649
You too.

32:21.586 --> 32:24.321
I wish we could've heard his voice.

32:42.809 --> 32:45.045
Alright, who wants to set the table?

32:45.145 --> 32:47.526
- Come on, buddy.
- Pizza!

32:49.259 --> 32:53.954
- I think you have to dive into the water.
- Okay, you're... okay.

32:57.930 --> 33:00.164
Okay, That's one more round
for you, buddy.

33:00.264 --> 33:01.821
Hey, Cody.

33:01.921 --> 33:05.003
You know, yesterday
you were asking about Sean?

33:08.349 --> 33:10.608
You want to see him?

33:12.463 --> 33:14.513
Yes, please.

33:24.224 --> 33:27.460
When's the last time
you had a real Christmas?

33:29.215 --> 33:31.414
I don't know.

33:32.864 --> 33:35.084
You will this year.

33:35.284 --> 33:38.726
- <i>Here he comes, here he comes.</i>
- <i>He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.</i>

33:42.979 --> 33:44.739
- <i>He came! He came!</i>
- That's him.

33:44.839 --> 33:47.176
<i>Merry Christmas, baby!</i>

33:48.696 --> 33:51.263
- <i>What do you think?</i>
- <i>I think it's a train.</i>

33:51.363 --> 33:55.607
- <i>Why? Did it whistle?</i>
- <i>Did Sean write train? I don't remember.</i>

33:55.707 --> 33:58.408
<i>You said to Santa you think about a train.</i>

34:01.766 --> 34:03.663
<i>What is it?</i>

34:03.763 --> 34:05.843
<i>I can't see it.</i>

34:05.943 --> 34:07.505
<i>What do you think?</i>

34:07.605 --> 34:09.619
<i>North Pole Express.
Do you know who lives in there?</i>

34:09.768 --> 34:14.268
- <i>North Pole Express. Santa lives there.</i>
- <i>Santa lives there.</i>

34:14.368 --> 34:17.224
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

34:34.619 --> 34:39.192
<i>Oh, my God, come on, fight back, buddy.
You can escape.</i>

34:47.562 --> 34:50.501
He used to give me Eskimo kisses.

34:52.331 --> 34:54.454
You see how he does that?

34:58.355 --> 35:00.667
<i>Where you going, buddy?</i>

35:04.047 --> 35:07.874
That's right, you didn't get
much sleep last night, did you?

35:08.369 --> 35:11.506
In this house it's okay for you to relax.

35:12.174 --> 35:13.976
You're home.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.160
Now get some sleep.

35:29.952 --> 35:31.892
I'm putting on another pot.

35:31.992 --> 35:33.991
Oh, let's call it the night.

35:34.091 --> 35:37.416
- He's a tough one, he needs to sleep.
- I know, babe. So do we.

35:38.628 --> 35:40.689
Let's go to bed.

35:41.196 --> 35:43.228
I'm going to make another pot.

35:43.977 --> 35:46.162
Okay. I'll go to bed.

35:56.912 --> 35:58.447
Jess.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.592
Jess.

36:46.194 --> 36:48.667
He came! He came!

36:59.635 --> 37:02.038
I think it's a train!

37:04.399 --> 37:07.399
Why? Did it whistle?

37:44.320 --> 37:45.923
Cody.

38:26.027 --> 38:30.094
I am always with you.

39:09.178 --> 39:11.250
Let's go to bed.

39:27.241 --> 39:28.736
What is that?

39:33.035 --> 39:35.336
The Canker Man.

39:35.929 --> 39:40.566
Sometimes, if I do this,
it keeps him away.

39:53.357 --> 39:56.318
- Boys are home.
- Hi there.

39:56.418 --> 39:58.642
Okay, go on.

40:11.708 --> 40:15.299
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I am a little hungry.

40:15.399 --> 40:18.562
Yeah? Okay. Why don't you go upstairs,
and wash your hands,

40:18.662 --> 40:23.396
and come back and tell me
all about your day? Okay? Okay.

40:26.644 --> 40:28.939
Are we going to talk about this?

41:00.718 --> 41:02.841
He needs to sleep.

41:03.926 --> 41:06.107
Okay, he needs to sleep.

41:06.207 --> 41:09.042
Yeah, Cody needs to sleep.

41:11.288 --> 41:15.422
But, Jessie, is that what this is about?
Or is this about Sean?

41:20.255 --> 41:21.828
Okay.

41:27.122 --> 41:30.828
- What are you doing?
- This feels wrong, Jess.

41:31.328 --> 41:32.882
This...

41:33.282 --> 41:36.717
It felt wrong...

41:37.417 --> 41:40.760
when you... you put in that DVD.

41:40.860 --> 41:42.917
And then...

41:43.017 --> 41:45.315
it hasn't felt right since.

41:46.034 --> 41:48.349
It feels like abuse.

41:48.449 --> 41:51.108
- Abuse?
- Yeah.

41:51.884 --> 41:56.754
- Abuse?
- We promised to take care of that child.

41:57.494 --> 42:02.290
Not use him like some
home movie projector for...

42:02.390 --> 42:06.546
That child needs to sleep.

42:07.805 --> 42:11.334
And if he can help us heal...

42:11.634 --> 42:14.455
we need to heal, Mark.

42:16.299 --> 42:19.129
- He can help us heal.
- This is not healing.

42:19.229 --> 42:21.635
I saw it in your face. You felt it too.

42:22.597 --> 42:25.872
Yeah, of course.

42:29.504 --> 42:32.159
If you want to go to bed, go to bed.

42:33.324 --> 42:34.651
- Jess.
- I'm staying here,

42:34.751 --> 42:37.200
and I'm waiting for Sean.

42:37.324 --> 42:40.886
Well, it's not our son, and it's not Sean,

42:40.986 --> 42:43.795
and it's not our son.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.111
I'm not going to let you
take him away from me again.

42:50.662 --> 42:52.065
Again?

42:54.203 --> 42:55.720
Hey.

42:57.288 --> 42:59.064
I'm sorry.

42:59.164 --> 43:01.178
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

43:06.261 --> 43:09.735
No. Not fair.

43:11.958 --> 43:14.876
It's not fair. Not fair.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.282
All right.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.845
You all set? Okay, go ahead.

43:53.663 --> 43:55.954
You started it, Tate.

44:06.908 --> 44:09.268
Thirteen plus five?

44:09.368 --> 44:10.905
- Hayden?
- Eighteen?

44:11.005 --> 44:12.488
Yes.

44:14.582 --> 44:16.655
Fifteen plus four?

44:16.755 --> 44:18.256
- Hunter?
- Nineteen.

44:18.356 --> 44:19.916
Good.

44:22.063 --> 44:24.619
Seven plus thirteen?

44:26.197 --> 44:28.434
- Clara?
- Twenty?

44:28.534 --> 44:30.047
Nice.

44:32.141 --> 44:33.569
Nine plus fourteen.

44:33.669 --> 44:36.893
This time is fine. But if you're
not feeling well enough for recess,

44:36.993 --> 44:39.284
maybe you should visit the nurse's room.

44:46.196 --> 44:48.698
Can I just stay here?

44:51.410 --> 44:53.547
I have to step out, just for a minute.

44:53.647 --> 44:56.080
Why not you put your head down and rest?

46:49.292 --> 46:51.747
- Cody, what's going on?
- Let's go home.

46:51.847 --> 46:54.739
- What happened?
- A kid ran away.

46:54.839 --> 46:56.141
What?

46:56.241 --> 47:01.131
He's done it before. He's a mean kid.
Can we go home, please?

47:02.951 --> 47:04.548
Okay.

47:11.057 --> 47:12.481
You okay?

47:13.377 --> 47:15.299
I'm fine.

47:15.399 --> 47:18.256
Well, we didn't see
very much of you tonight.

47:18.356 --> 47:21.352
I'm sorry, I don't feel very well.

47:21.652 --> 47:23.854
Don't feel well?

47:24.354 --> 47:26.561
Let's have a look at you.

47:29.641 --> 47:32.473
Worried about what happened
at school today?

47:33.294 --> 47:37.223
Well, I think it's going to be okay,
that little boy's going to turn up.

47:47.391 --> 47:49.939
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:50.639 --> 47:52.893
Well, you...

47:53.193 --> 47:55.866
You could use some sleep too, you know?

47:55.966 --> 47:57.651
I'll be in soon.

47:58.001 --> 47:59.863
Okay.

50:26.017 --> 50:29.493
I'm awake, this can't be happening.
I'm awake, this can't be happening.

50:29.593 --> 50:32.787
I'm awake, this can't be happening.
I'm awake, this can't be happening.

50:41.395 --> 50:43.769
No! No! No!

50:45.292 --> 50:47.746
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake!

50:47.846 --> 50:51.207
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake!

50:51.307 --> 50:52.441
I'm awake.

50:53.866 --> 50:57.795
- No! No! No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?

50:57.895 --> 50:59.661
- No! Stop!
- Cody, stop.

50:59.761 --> 51:02.501
- I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm awake!
- I got you. I got you.

51:02.601 --> 51:06.405
- I'm awake. I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you. Hey, hey, hey.

51:06.505 --> 51:10.405
- I'm awake. I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you.

51:10.505 --> 51:13.918
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

51:14.980 --> 51:17.932
I'm sick. I don't want to go to school.

51:18.232 --> 51:20.661
- Sick, huh?
- Yes, sir.

51:20.761 --> 51:22.777
That's too bad.

51:22.877 --> 51:27.001
I guess you won't be interested
in doing a little shopping today.

51:27.101 --> 51:29.294
Pick up some stuff for your new room.

51:29.394 --> 51:32.003
I don't think I deserve to.

51:34.577 --> 51:39.511
If there is one thing I know,
you deserve a good day.

51:40.645 --> 51:43.308
- How long hasn't he slept?
- At least two days.

51:43.408 --> 51:45.210
But it's been going on
since he first got home.

51:45.310 --> 51:47.890
I'm giving him Zolpidem.
It's a paediatric Ambien.

51:47.990 --> 51:51.004
Just a pill before bedtime
should do the trick.

51:53.883 --> 51:57.145
It's just to get him started.
We can't let him stay up for days on end.

51:57.245 --> 52:00.380
Sleep deprivation at this age
can do real damage.

52:01.609 --> 52:03.455
Thank you.

52:16.843 --> 52:19.797
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:26.353 --> 52:27.518
Can I help you guys?

52:27.618 --> 52:31.928
I'm Detective Brown,
this is Officer Murray.

52:32.128 --> 52:36.458
We'd like to ask your son a few questions
about an incident that took place at school.

52:36.940 --> 52:39.050
Cody, come here.

52:46.747 --> 52:49.587
- Okay, screw.
- Screw.

52:50.939 --> 52:53.691
- Phillips.
- Phillips.

53:01.522 --> 53:05.128
Just be sure you cough or something
when you get downstairs, okay?

53:12.189 --> 53:15.305
- Hey, there he is.
- You look better.

53:15.405 --> 53:17.828
- I feel a little better.
- Good.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.935
So, the police came by today.

53:21.035 --> 53:23.021
- What they want?
- Well...

53:23.121 --> 53:26.149
I feel a lot better.
Do you want to see my race car bed?

53:26.249 --> 53:29.268
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that.

53:29.368 --> 53:32.196
I guess this little kid
still hasn't shown back up.

53:32.296 --> 53:33.813
So, why'd they come here?

53:33.913 --> 53:36.934
Well, I guess they have
to rule out abduction.

53:37.034 --> 53:41.312
- I guess Cody saw the kid leave.
- How did Sean die?

53:43.637 --> 53:45.225
What?

53:47.338 --> 53:49.897
I just wondered.

53:56.504 --> 54:00.841
Hey, buddy.
Why not you go set the table? Okay?

54:01.241 --> 54:03.459
We'll be in in a minute.

54:39.237 --> 54:40.405
Nice.

54:40.905 --> 54:43.320
Like Tik Tak Toc game.

54:46.308 --> 54:49.152
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:50.046 --> 54:53.510
- What do you think?
- That is orange.

54:53.810 --> 54:56.870
Aren't you glad we didn't go with fuchsia?

54:56.970 --> 54:59.702
- What's this?
- Here you go.

55:02.176 --> 55:03.838
Alright.

55:04.638 --> 55:06.695
Thank you.

55:06.795 --> 55:09.014
You're welcome.

55:10.363 --> 55:12.595
Use a fork?

55:13.638 --> 55:16.256
This is very civilized.

55:33.142 --> 55:37.165
- Today was fun.
- Today was my favorite day so far.

55:37.465 --> 55:40.488
Yeah? Mine, too.

55:42.141 --> 55:44.317
Hey, listen...

55:45.081 --> 55:48.146
about the question that you asked me...

55:49.189 --> 55:50.791
earlier.

55:52.932 --> 55:57.322
Sean drowned. It was an accident.

55:58.349 --> 56:03.132
And then, we found out
we couldn't have more kids, so...

56:03.766 --> 56:06.856
I'm sorry I asked about that.

56:08.114 --> 56:10.568
No, no. It's...

56:10.668 --> 56:13.097
You have the right to know.

56:13.397 --> 56:15.907
It's just important to you
also know that...

56:16.007 --> 56:19.235
nothing like that is ever
going to happen to you.

56:43.426 --> 56:45.285
You okay?

56:48.153 --> 56:50.073
I don't think I am.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.994
You're a great mom.

56:58.257 --> 57:00.534
That kid up there...

57:03.011 --> 57:05.404
he needs a great mom.

57:06.098 --> 57:09.159
You need a kid. It's a perfect match.

57:10.369 --> 57:12.862
We don't need anything else.

57:24.189 --> 57:26.954
I know that you think you do.

57:27.754 --> 57:32.002
And God knows there's a big part
of me it feels the same.

57:35.627 --> 57:37.770
But we don't.

57:48.233 --> 57:50.365
Come to bed.

57:58.420 --> 58:00.484
Come to bed.

58:02.393 --> 58:03.912
Okay.

58:09.437 --> 58:11.695
Yes, love.

58:47.942 --> 58:49.617
Sean?

59:02.339 --> 59:05.808
Cody, Cody. Wake up, wake up.

59:14.554 --> 59:16.971
- Wake up, honey. Wake up!
- Mark.

59:17.071 --> 59:21.072
- He won't wake up.
- He won't... for a while.

59:22.708 --> 59:25.677
- What did you do?
- He's...

59:25.927 --> 59:27.186
Cody!

59:28.550 --> 59:31.469
Cody! Cody! Wake up!

59:32.609 --> 59:34.618
Come on, wake up.

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:03.530
Get out of here!

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.166
She won't wake up. She won't wake up.

01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:30.731
Here.

01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:34.121
She's awake. She's awake.

01:00:39.575 --> 01:00:41.597
I'd like to take your
formal statement, Mrs. Hobsen

01:00:41.697 --> 01:00:45.050
and then refer you to someone
in social services.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:48.775
- Social services?
- Why did you drug the child?

01:00:49.025 --> 01:00:50.579
I...

01:00:50.879 --> 01:00:55.398
gave him a sleeping pill.
His doctor prescribed it.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.289
You know the whereabouts of your husband
the day before last around lunch time?

01:01:00.389 --> 01:01:02.204
- Where are you taking him?
- We have any reason

01:01:02.304 --> 01:01:06.298
- to be near of your son's school.
- No. No. No, no, no.

01:01:06.398 --> 01:01:09.948
I'm sorry. Ma'am, we have to remove
the child from the house.

01:01:10.048 --> 01:01:13.716
- No, please. You can't take him away.
- Ma'am, please.

01:01:58.985 --> 01:02:00.636
Natalie.

01:02:00.736 --> 01:02:03.527
You haven't returned my phone calls.

01:02:03.627 --> 01:02:07.535
I was at the police station, all night.

01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:10.430
Where is he?

01:02:12.452 --> 01:02:15.125
It's not your business anymore.

01:02:15.662 --> 01:02:17.837
Where's your husband?

01:02:18.155 --> 01:02:21.707
I don't know.
That's why I have to speak to Cody.

01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:23.643
That's not going to happen.

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:26.354
I need to find out more about him.

01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:29.019
About his dreams.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.938
You've heard this before.

01:02:40.475 --> 01:02:43.341
There are several great support groups
in here, and a few therapists

01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:45.731
who specialize in domestic violence.

01:02:45.831 --> 01:02:48.626
I want you to reach out,
get some help for your situation.

01:02:48.726 --> 01:02:50.655
And I never want to see you again.

01:03:34.997 --> 01:03:37.117
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:03:37.217 --> 01:03:40.492
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm here to see Whelan Young.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.810
Whelan, you have a visitor.

01:03:49.838 --> 01:03:51.687
Thank you.

01:03:53.633 --> 01:03:55.849
What can I do for you?

01:03:56.418 --> 01:03:58.984
I'm here to talk about Cody Morgan.

01:04:11.318 --> 01:04:15.086
It says here that you
and your wife Katherine

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:17.474
fostered Cody for 15 months

01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:22.284
before he was given
to Peter and Doris Clemens.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.476
Wouldn't know about them.

01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:28.182
They disappeared a year ago.

01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:30.984
Much like your wife.

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:34.631
What are we talking about here, miss?

01:04:34.731 --> 01:04:37.941
We're talking about
what happens when he dreams.

01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:42.121
I've seen it, too.

01:04:42.221 --> 01:04:44.331
You have now?

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:50.862
I watched it... take my husband.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.916
I wouldn't say that around here.

01:04:54.416 --> 01:04:56.593
They fit you for slippers.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.482
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
then I'm wasting important time.

01:05:00.582 --> 01:05:02.448
Hey, wait.

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:04.460
I'm sorry.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.688
You know, I hear "you're crazy"
for so long before you start to believe it.

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:11.969
Please.

01:05:17.889 --> 01:05:20.650
That little boy's dreams come true.

01:05:23.203 --> 01:05:26.286
Real and true.

01:05:27.186 --> 01:05:31.627
It's an amazing, beautiful thing.

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:35.056
But so are his nightmares.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.671
They're...

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:39.147
Dangerous.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.934
Deadly.

01:05:44.695 --> 01:05:47.060
Can I get him back?

01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:49.746
My husband.

01:05:53.502 --> 01:05:55.309
I don't know.

01:05:55.409 --> 01:05:58.655
Wherever that thing comes from...

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:01.477
it takes them with it.

01:06:01.742 --> 01:06:04.951
If they exist at all,
it's only in Cody's mind.

01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:07.129
How do you know that?

01:06:08.034 --> 01:06:11.323
Katie and I fostered two kids before Cody.

01:06:11.423 --> 01:06:14.856
His mother died, no other family.

01:06:15.256 --> 01:06:17.328
He was sweet...

01:06:18.111 --> 01:06:21.952
independent. An artist, I thought.

01:06:23.637 --> 01:06:26.022
Started with the butterflies.

01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:55.290
That went on for a few weeks.

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:59.239
We though it was magical.

01:07:00.118 --> 01:07:02.484
And then, Katie got sick.

01:07:02.984 --> 01:07:05.235
Had a bad flu.

01:07:07.702 --> 01:07:11.317
And it seemed to really upset Cody.

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.266
And then...

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.790
No!

01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:00.757
I'm sorry.

01:08:36.504 --> 01:08:38.886
But it wasn't Katie.

01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:44.216
It was just his impression of her.

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:49.048
That was all what was left.

01:08:52.522 --> 01:08:54.718
He was too young.

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:58.238
He was too young...

01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:02.819
to even remember her right.

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:08.765
And I hated him for that.

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:14.245
I know I shouldn't have,
but God help me, I hated him for that.

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:22.180
But I couldn't do it.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.573
I couldn't do it.

01:09:26.919 --> 01:09:30.837
If I had, you're husband would be alive.

01:09:31.438 --> 01:09:34.331
That another family would be alive.

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:38.078
Maybe you can...

01:09:39.822 --> 01:09:42.153
succeed where I failed.

01:09:42.502 --> 01:09:44.108
No.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.729
- No.
- It's the only way.

01:09:47.828 --> 01:09:50.273
Thank you for your time.

01:09:51.216 --> 01:09:53.488
And I'm sorry for your loss, as well.

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:57.234
Do you really want to bet your life that an
8 year old won't have another nightmare?

01:10:00.684 --> 01:10:04.145
- It's not his fault.
- It'd be a mercy.

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:07.241
Someone has to do it.

01:10:07.741 --> 01:10:10.359
Do you know anything
about his birth mother?

01:10:11.127 --> 01:10:13.512
There's nothing in the file.

01:10:13.813 --> 01:10:16.090
Only that she died.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.545
I assume the way my wife did.

01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:25.958
The way your husband did.

01:10:28.144 --> 01:10:30.662
What are you hoping to find?

01:11:30.946 --> 01:11:35.256
Dr. Tennant told me not to come back
without the patient file. He's try to call.

01:11:35.456 --> 01:11:37.445
Do you have the PID?

01:11:37.545 --> 01:11:41.357
I don't. All I have
is a last name and a date.

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:49.079
Night nurse said
he didn't sleep last night.

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:51.647
That's two nights in a row then.

01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:53.278
That we know of.

01:11:53.378 --> 01:11:57.081
Policy says that we can't
let him go this long.

01:11:57.774 --> 01:12:01.782
I'd like to stay here with him
tonight if that's okay.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:10.693
You signed for the file, you can take it.

01:12:17.877 --> 01:12:21.734
There is a PE number here on the intake.
How long you keep those?

01:12:22.514 --> 01:12:25.251
If nobody claimed them,
there's a chance they're still down there.

01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:14.398
No! No!

01:13:14.498 --> 01:13:16.205
- Cody, it's for your own good.
- It's alright.

01:13:16.305 --> 01:13:20.096
- I don't want to hurt anymore.
- It'll only take a second.

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:26.386
Good job, son.

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:28.166
It's okay.

01:13:30.297 --> 01:13:34.200
A case of mine was transferred, and I need
the name of the facility for the report.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.263
Natalie Friedman. F-R-I-E-D-M-A-N.

01:13:38.363 --> 01:13:41.842
Provider number, 11714.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:45.887
Cody Morgan.

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:33.476
Where is he?

01:15:54.022 --> 01:15:55.706
Mommy.

01:18:22.919 --> 01:18:24.520
Cody?

01:20:06.195 --> 01:20:08.438
It keeps them safe...

01:20:09.423 --> 01:20:11.708
until they've grown up.

01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:22.470
Let them go.

01:24:11.678 --> 01:24:13.370
Wait!

01:24:16.774 --> 01:24:18.785
I'm taking him home.

01:24:52.628 --> 01:24:54.902
This is for you.

01:24:55.813 --> 01:24:58.039
It's your mother's journal.

01:25:00.469 --> 01:25:04.930
Your mother's name was Andrea Morgan.

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:07.908
And I can tell by reading this...

01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:11.320
she loved you very, very much.

01:25:14.556 --> 01:25:18.332
When you were a baby,
she noticed you were special.

01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:30.221
It was just the two of you
against the world.

01:25:33.809 --> 01:25:37.537
She writes a lot about you,
and about your gift.

01:25:37.637 --> 01:25:41.282
And how much she loved watching it grow.

01:25:47.523 --> 01:25:51.065
I don't think she's stopped
writing because she didn't want to.

01:25:51.315 --> 01:25:54.005
I think it's because...

01:25:54.735 --> 01:25:57.125
she got sick.

01:25:59.475 --> 01:26:02.811
Which just happen sometimes.

01:26:08.776 --> 01:26:12.304
These are some of your
mother's test results.

01:26:13.739 --> 01:26:15.869
Do you see that word there?

01:26:17.142 --> 01:26:18.877
Canker.

01:26:20.813 --> 01:26:22.747
Not quite.

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:32.499
It's difficult to explain
what cancer is to children...

01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:35.936
in terms they can understand.

01:26:39.389 --> 01:26:44.485
Your mother started to look
very different, very fast.

01:26:48.106 --> 01:26:51.489
And by the time she was
in the Intensive Care Unit,

01:26:51.589 --> 01:26:55.255
they started looking
foster parents for you.

01:26:55.655 --> 01:27:00.256
But they would've brought you in
to see her one last time...

01:27:00.556 --> 01:27:02.594
to say goodbye.

01:27:16.659 --> 01:27:19.336
Her voice would've been hard to hear.

01:27:19.836 --> 01:27:23.791
But I know she would've
tried to say, if she could...

01:27:23.891 --> 01:27:27.320
the one thing she would never
want you to forget.

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.247
I...

01:27:30.106 --> 01:27:31.736
am...

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:35.400
always with you.

01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:40.213
Once you got older...

01:27:40.313 --> 01:27:42.631
you'd forget most of this.

01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:46.813
And you'd tell people
the Canker ate your mommy.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.460
And as more time went by...

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.695
in your mind.

01:27:52.795 --> 01:27:55.040
The Canker Man

01:27:56.332 --> 01:27:58.597
ate my mommy.

01:27:59.906 --> 01:28:02.712
In your mind, Cody.

01:28:05.349 --> 01:28:10.003
Your amazing, special,
one of a kind mind...

01:28:10.103 --> 01:28:12.146
made him real.

01:28:13.799 --> 01:28:16.002
I'm so sorry.

01:28:16.443 --> 01:28:18.586
I'm so sorry.

01:28:19.804 --> 01:28:23.249
I used you, like I did for Sean.

01:28:26.803 --> 01:28:30.371
But I'll never do that again...

01:28:31.086 --> 01:28:32.628
okay?

01:28:33.069 --> 01:28:34.525
Never.

01:28:38.971 --> 01:28:43.278
Here we go. Here. Close to me, there.

01:28:44.237 --> 01:28:48.466
Remember, there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

01:28:49.183 --> 01:28:52.387
I'm going to be here with you, all night.

01:28:52.587 --> 01:28:55.589
Will you tell me a bedtime story?

01:28:58.558 --> 01:29:00.286
Sure.

01:29:05.742 --> 01:29:08.085
Once upon a time...

01:29:08.984 --> 01:29:11.323
there was a special little boy...

01:29:12.623 --> 01:29:15.084
who needed a mom.

01:29:16.827 --> 01:29:19.664
And there was a sad mom...

01:29:20.381 --> 01:29:22.638
she needed a son.

01:29:22.738 --> 01:29:25.279
Is this a happy story?

01:29:26.637 --> 01:29:28.671
I think it is.

01:29:29.557 --> 01:29:31.659
Has a happy ending, anyway.

01:29:32.059 --> 01:29:34.720
It feels like it can't.

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:38.143
Because those are people...

01:29:39.147 --> 01:29:41.416
who went away.

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:45.421
No one ever really goes away.

01:29:46.121 --> 01:29:48.126
Not completely.

01:29:48.784 --> 01:29:51.477
Because they live in our minds...

01:29:51.577 --> 01:29:53.827
and in our hearts.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:29:59.812
In this story...

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:03.782
that bully from school woke up in his bed,

01:30:03.882 --> 01:30:06.325
like nothing ever happened.

01:30:06.852 --> 01:30:11.522
And whatever made him
so sad and mean was gone.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:16.878
And that nice lady who care for the boy,

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:19.239
she came back to her husband,

01:30:19.339 --> 01:30:22.518
and they lived happily ever after.

01:30:30.915 --> 01:30:32.777
And Daddy...

01:30:37.415 --> 01:30:40.651
Daddy got the best present of all.

01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:55.491
Can those things happen?

01:30:59.044 --> 01:31:01.810
I guess that depends on you, Cody.

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:06.584
You have an amazing gift.

01:31:09.221 --> 01:31:12.471
Who knows what can happen as it grows?

01:31:12.724 --> 01:31:15.402
Thanks for bringing me home.

01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:20.064
Mom.
