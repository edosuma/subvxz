<b>1x16 - "Steam Lantern"</b>

00:21.554 --> 00:22.803
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:24.798 --> 00:26.514
No Jordan, get out of there!

00:26.515 --> 00:28.515
[hummimg]

00:29.213 --> 00:30.754
Hal!

00:30.994 --> 00:32.884
[explosion]

00:37.831 --> 00:39.741
[humming]

00:51.483 --> 00:52.788
[crash]

00:55.315 --> 00:59.151
[groans]
Two for style on that landing.

01:01.382 --> 01:03.008
Green Lanterns, come in.

01:03.043 --> 01:05.601
Aya respond, please. Anyone?

01:15.467 --> 01:18.954
<i>Do not whistle happily in the morn
as you make your way to the factories.</i>

01:18.989 --> 01:21.962
<i>Each and every turn
of a wrench is a symbol of</i>

01:21.997 --> 01:24.634
<i>of Duke Nigel Thortonberry's tyranny!</i>

01:27.583 --> 01:28.691
<i>Attention.</i>

01:28.726 --> 01:32.803
<i>You are in non-compliance
with several public safety ordinances.</i>

01:32.838 --> 01:36.620
<i>Please disperse or face
imprisonment and a fine.</i>

01:36.655 --> 01:40.493
No, you are in non-compliance
of our basic dignity.

01:40.528 --> 01:43.003
There is no happiness
without freedom!

01:43.038 --> 01:44.777
<i>You have plenty of freedom.</i>

01:44.812 --> 01:48.305
<i>Don't listen to this barmy
woman! I saved the planet.</i>

01:48.340 --> 01:51.314
<i>We'll live happily if you do as I say.</i>

01:52.851 --> 01:54.259

01:57.371 --> 01:59.325
[humming]
[crash]

02:08.062 --> 02:10.562
[people cheering]

02:13.889 --> 02:15.922
Listen to Lady Catherine, people!

02:15.957 --> 02:17.991
She always makes
right good sense.

02:18.026 --> 02:20.040
<i>Don't root for that radical!</i>

02:20.075 --> 02:23.192
<i>Anyone cheering will be
sent to the work houses!</i>

02:23.227 --> 02:25.416
<i>He's an upstart and a fraud!</i>

02:34.509 --> 02:36.239
[crash]

02:45.460 --> 02:47.132
[sighs]

02:52.396 --> 02:54.442
Cheers! Follow us.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.452
[music]

03:10.234 --> 03:12.927
Glad you could join us.
I am Lady Catherine.

03:12.962 --> 03:15.657
And this is my associate and beau,
Gil Broome, Esquire.

03:15.692 --> 03:17.641
Hal Jordan, nice to meet you.

03:17.676 --> 03:19.322
Cor blimey!

03:19.357 --> 03:22.290
Are you... are you a real
and true Green Lantern?

03:22.325 --> 03:25.417
I am!
And you're... what?

03:26.551 --> 03:28.344
I'm a Steam Lantern.

03:29.538 --> 03:30.828
I'm not having a laugh.

03:30.863 --> 03:34.029
I modeled myself after a bloke
who saved our entire planet.

03:34.064 --> 03:37.377
Called himself Green Lantern.
Proper hero he was.

03:37.412 --> 03:40.131
<i>Wore a red shirt and a cape.
Do you know him?</i>

03:40.166 --> 03:43.245
<i>A Green Lantern with a cape?
Doesn't ring a bell.</i>

03:43.280 --> 03:46.280
- So, you built this thing?
- Course not.

03:46.315 --> 03:48.404
Lady Catherine is
the brains of this outfit.

03:48.439 --> 03:51.485
- I just discovered the Hardtofindium.
- The what-what?

03:51.520 --> 03:52.761
<i>Hardtofindium.</i>

03:52.796 --> 03:55.317
It's the rare element
that powers the suit's boiler

03:55.352 --> 03:56.940
and flange combustion motivator.

04:03.131 --> 04:06.026
We named it Hardtofindium
'cause it's really, really...

04:06.061 --> 04:09.425
Yeah, I get it. So, basically
you're wearing a nuclear reactor

04:09.460 --> 04:11.577
you cobbled together with
chicken wire and string.

04:11.612 --> 04:13.604
We had to build it, so we could fight.

04:13.639 --> 04:15.944
<i>It's not all wine and hoses here.</i>

04:15.979 --> 04:18.375
<i>Duke Nigel rules with an iron fist.</i>

04:18.410 --> 04:20.983
The old guy you were fighting?
What's his problem?

04:21.019 --> 04:24.361
For ages now, the stars have
been blinking out, one by one.

04:24.396 --> 04:26.905
<i>Lady Catherine: Duke Nigel,
our most brilliant scientist</i>

04:26.940 --> 04:30.444
<i>said could save our world
if we did exactly what he told us.</i>

04:30.479 --> 04:32.552
<i>Gil: Became a proper tyrant, he did.</i>

04:32.587 --> 04:35.418
<i>Turned our world into one
massive industrial nightmare.</i>

04:36.003 --> 04:37.795
<i>Cat and I couldn't take anymore.</i>

04:37.830 --> 04:39.504
<i>We're leading a rebellion against him</i>

04:39.539 --> 04:42.254
<i>from "Battling Bathilda",
our dirigy blimp ever since.</i>

04:43.155 --> 04:45.247
Our defiance is indefatigable.

04:45.282 --> 04:47.422
Even in the face of that
horrid space Dragoon

04:47.457 --> 04:49.335
the Duke tried to frighten us with.

04:49.370 --> 04:52.901
- Space Dragoon?
- It calls itself the Anti-Monitor.

04:53.781 --> 04:55.364
Anti-Monitor. huh?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.087
- I was just fighting it.
- But that's impossible!

04:59.122 --> 05:02.998
My Gil defeated the beast.
Sent it packing to another Universe.

05:03.033 --> 05:06.775
<i>Hit it so hard to the
very sky ripped. See?</i>

05:07.218 --> 05:10.518
- Is that true?
- Oh... righty right!

05:10.519 --> 05:12.584
Too true. Like Gerka Stew.

05:12.619 --> 05:15.510
I say... perhaps
you're from the Universe

05:15.545 --> 05:19.492
- where Gil chased the Dragoon.
- So that's why no one's answering.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.690
I must have been blasted through.

05:21.725 --> 05:24.122
If only there was some way
to contact my friends.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.066
Signal the other side?
I don't see how.

05:27.101 --> 05:28.988
It'd take a shocking amount of power.

05:29.023 --> 05:32.025
Might be enough electro-volts
in Duke Nigel's laboratory.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.504
But he's not the kind of fella
to be giving out prezzies.

05:34.539 --> 05:37.151
Well, maybe we'll just
have to take a prezzie.

05:42.036 --> 05:43.382
[humming]

05:44.984 --> 05:46.234
[crash in distance]

05:46.235 --> 05:47.235
[whoosh]

06:04.669 --> 06:07.356
Your Duke Nigel certainly
seems interested in the sun.

06:07.391 --> 06:09.191
Gil: Even a despot needs a hobby.

06:09.226 --> 06:12.596
<i>Almost in.
Getting closer. If I use this setting</i>

06:12.631 --> 06:15.402
should amplify your ring
signal trans-dimensionally.

06:21.856 --> 06:23.730
<i>If Jordan died, we would
have saw his ring fly off</i>

06:23.765 --> 06:27.278
to find a new owner, right?
I didn't see no ring, did you?

06:27.313 --> 06:31.108
Lantern Kilowog, what happened
is obvious to everyone but you.

06:31.143 --> 06:33.684
Jordan's one of the toughtest
ring slingers in the Corps!

06:33.719 --> 06:35.812
- Where do you get up the...
<i>- Kilowog, come in.</i>

06:35.847 --> 06:38.049
Shut your talk, Hal Jordan,
I'm right in the middle...

06:38.561 --> 06:40.649
Jordan? It's Jordan!

06:41.068 --> 06:44.652
Ha ha ha! Told ya!
Where are you kid? You OK?

06:44.687 --> 06:47.084
<i>Aya: The sensors are not
reading his location.</i>

06:47.119 --> 06:50.275
<i>The Green Lantern Hal is not
registering in this sector at all.</i>

06:50.310 --> 06:53.349
That's because I'm not in
your sector, or... Universe.

06:53.384 --> 06:56.125
That thing we were fighting?
Calls itself the Anti-Monitor.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.927
<i>Comes from a parallel Universe.</i>

06:57.962 --> 07:00.757
<i>When it hit me, I was
knocked in where it came from.</i>

07:00.792 --> 07:02.445
Well, how do you bring back?

07:02.480 --> 07:05.478
There's a big rip in the sky here,
just like the one over Biot.

07:05.513 --> 07:07.998
The Anti-Monitor used it to cross over.

07:08.033 --> 07:09.521
So maybe I could use it to get back.

07:09.556 --> 07:11.069
Theoretically, perhaps.

07:11.104 --> 07:13.817
But the power to breach the
barrier between the Universes

07:13.852 --> 07:15.391
would need to be monumental.

07:15.426 --> 07:17.818
Well, evidently a Green Lantern
has been here before.

07:17.853 --> 07:20.331
And if he can find a way back,
so can we.

07:20.366 --> 07:21.872
<i>Rendezvous in 12 hours.</i>

07:21.907 --> 07:23.913
<i>With both of us applying
power from each side,</i>

07:23.948 --> 07:26.669
hopefully we can make a
opening for me to slip through.

07:28.741 --> 07:29.642
Ugh.

07:31.365 --> 07:33.241
[shot]
[crash]

07:33.354 --> 07:35.353
Agh!

07:35.887 --> 07:39.059
<i>Duke: This time you won't escape me,
Steam Lantern!</i>

07:39.094 --> 07:42.844
In fact, none of you 
are leaving here alive!

07:48.418 --> 07:51.310
<i>Uninvited guests, the affrontery!</i>

07:51.345 --> 07:54.738
So, Steam Lantern has it come to this?

07:54.773 --> 07:57.253
Involving others in
breaking and entering?

07:57.254 --> 07:58.909
We will never be your slaves!

07:59.444 --> 08:03.855
Slaves? I only wish credit
where credit is due, madam!

08:03.890 --> 08:08.070
I saved the world, and this man...
This man!

08:08.105 --> 08:10.708
<i> ...stole the credit
and my glory, isn't that right?</i>

08:10.743 --> 08:13.682
<i>We Thortonberrys have a
way of dealing with thieves,</i>

08:13.717 --> 08:18.796
be it for a jar of jamberry
preserves, or my spotless reputation.

08:20.119 --> 08:21.418
<i>Ugh!</i>

08:23.095 --> 08:24.975
[whirring]

08:26.304 --> 08:28.528
[crashes]

08:33.664 --> 08:34.924
If you bother these two again,

08:34.960 --> 08:37.280
I'm gonna have to bring this
place down around your ears.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.513
- You get me?
- I say!

08:51.284 --> 08:53.910
My hero.
You were wonderful!

08:53.945 --> 08:56.612
I think you were watching
 a different musical revue next by.

08:57.113 --> 08:59.593
- Hal here saved us.
- Pish posh!

08:59.628 --> 09:01.922
Hal helped, of course,
but he's leaving.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.903
You're the one
everyone counts on, Gil.

09:04.988 --> 09:06.834
I'll prime the internal
combustinators for our

09:06.869 --> 09:08.745
journey to the stratolayer,
and the scar.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.524
You'll be home in time for tea.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.911
Thanks.
To both of you.

09:13.437 --> 09:14.967
Do you really have to go?

09:14.968 --> 09:18.081
It's kind of important.
The fate of our Universe and all.

09:18.116 --> 09:19.254
What's eating you?

09:19.255 --> 09:22.960
My conscience, I suppose.
You see, Sir Nigel's right.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.662
He's the one who saved
the planet, not me.

09:27.117 --> 09:29.490
<i>Gil: Our Universe was about to snuff it.</i>

09:30.116 --> 09:32.912
<i>That space Dragoon was
eating it piece by piece.</i>

09:34.198 --> 09:37.968
<i>Nigel Thortonberry said he could
save us. But didn't say how.</i>

09:38.733 --> 09:40.937
<i>Turns out he made a
deal with the devil.</i>

09:41.661 --> 09:43.778
<i>Told the beast if he
spared our planet,</i>

09:43.813 --> 09:46.453
<i>he'd invent a ray to cut
through to another dimension.</i>

09:46.488 --> 09:49.786
<i>Give the Dragoon a whole
new Universe to feed on.</i>

09:50.298 --> 09:53.053
<i>Our planet went on
 a single-minded industrial sprint</i>

09:53.088 --> 09:54.794
<i>that changed it forever.</i>

09:54.829 --> 09:56.768
<i>Lost our freedom on the way.</i>

09:57.391 --> 09:59.099
<i>I decided to fight that.</i>

10:07.186 --> 10:09.758
<i>Didn't know about the Professor's
bargain with the creature,</i>

10:09.793 --> 10:11.777
<i>but when it showed up
to use the portal,</i>

10:11.812 --> 10:13.793
<i>I gave it the old one-two.</i>

10:14.735 --> 10:17.931
<i>I took my suit to the limit,
hit it with everything I had.</i>

10:17.966 --> 10:21.488
<i>The monster didn't even notice.
I was less than a flea to him.</i>

10:22.856 --> 10:26.731
<i>At that precise moment,
the Duke was preparing his beam.</i>

10:27.663 --> 10:31.045
<i>And sent that Dragoon away,
just as he had negotiated.</i>

10:32.673 --> 10:35.211
<i>But everyone here,
like Cat, thought I'd won.</i>

10:35.212 --> 10:37.212
[all cheering]

10:37.786 --> 10:39.670
<i>Think I'm a hero, they do.</i>

10:39.705 --> 10:41.836
<i>Nothing could be
further from the truth.</i>

10:41.871 --> 10:44.184
Right blinking fraud I am.

10:45.047 --> 10:47.858
Is there any way you could stay
and help me fight Duke Nigel?

10:47.893 --> 10:51.804
The Anti-Monitor's in my Universe,
and I have to face it.

10:51.914 --> 10:54.405
Right.
Have a better go than I did.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.568
You're doing a better
job than you think.

10:57.017 --> 10:59.438
Being a hero isn't
always about fighting.

10:59.473 --> 11:02.132
It's about protecting those
who can't protect themselves.

11:04.366 --> 11:06.359
<i>The engines are ready to
our trip to the scar.</i>

11:06.394 --> 11:08.052
And if you can't force
your way across,

11:08.087 --> 11:09.786
my Gil can simply
throw you through,

11:09.821 --> 11:11.615
just like he did with
the Anti-Monitor.

11:12.135 --> 11:13.952
It's good to know
we have a backup plan.

11:13.987 --> 11:15.262
Then "Tally Ho"!

11:15.297 --> 11:17.516
Gil, be a dear and get
the bellows, won't you?

11:17.849 --> 11:20.428
Oh!
Righty right, sugar plum.

11:22.433 --> 11:25.656
[music]

11:34.096 --> 11:37.915
We've got the right place.
Now just wait for the right time.

11:43.267 --> 11:47.368
<i>Bathilda can't go much higher.
She's maxed out.</i>

11:47.403 --> 11:49.267
Throttle back,
you've done enough,

11:49.302 --> 11:50.834
and save me some ring power.

11:50.869 --> 11:52.722
I need every bit to blast through.

11:52.757 --> 11:54.203
<i>Top floor, Mr. Jordan.</i>

11:54.238 --> 11:57.087
<i>Top coats, top hats,
various dry sundries and...</i>

11:57.535 --> 11:59.440
<i>the gateway to your Universe.</i>

12:00.741 --> 12:05.009
I'd wish good luck...
but I don't you need it.  See ya.

12:05.010 --> 12:07.010
[music]

12:11.958 --> 12:13.566
I hope this works.

12:14.237 --> 12:18.634
[whirring]
[cracking in distance]

12:24.117 --> 12:26.497
Thought I'd add a few
pot-shots of my own.

12:28.989 --> 12:32.543
<i>Aya: Attention. Inter-dimensional
rift is now opening.</i>

12:35.757 --> 12:38.677
[humming]

12:39.769 --> 12:41.664
[helicopter whirring]

12:43.735 --> 12:45.594
<i>Duke: You are under arrest.</i>

12:45.629 --> 12:48.292
<i>Land your lighter-than-air
craft immediately.</i>

12:48.327 --> 12:52.296
<i>Failure to comply will result
in gunfire directed at you.</i>

12:54.374 --> 12:56.974
Get home, I'll deal with him.

13:03.747 --> 13:05.371
Come on Jordan!

13:06.324 --> 13:07.986
[impact]

13:09.318 --> 13:12.141
[railgun firing]

13:14.094 --> 13:16.379
[explosion]

13:17.180 --> 13:19.180
[dramatic music]

13:20.357 --> 13:21.980
<i>Aah!</i>

13:31.453 --> 13:33.559
Jordan!
What are you doing?

13:44.827 --> 13:46.906
Ah.
Aah!

13:50.442 --> 13:52.696
<i>Agh!</i>

13:57.596 --> 14:02.539
 [humming]
[crowd gasping]

14:10.619 --> 14:14.100
 [hissing]

14:22.709 --> 14:24.417
<i>Cat, are you alright?</i>

14:24.452 --> 14:26.735
Oh, if anything happened,
I'd be lost.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.207
Had her all the way, Gil.

14:28.242 --> 14:31.579
But it's now impossible for
you to get to your Universe.

14:32.692 --> 14:36.779
<i>This had gone on long enough!
Stay where you are.</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:41.039
If you use that ring,
Green Lantern, I'll be forced to fire.

14:50.519 --> 14:52.316
<i>You'll never stop resisting.</i>

14:52.351 --> 14:55.872
<i>As much as it pains me, I have to
think of what's best for the world.</i>

14:55.907 --> 14:59.408
Do your worst! You'll never
be half the hero my Gil is.

14:59.443 --> 15:01.753
Stop! Both of you!

15:01.788 --> 15:04.924
Duke Nigel, if you'll let
my Lady Catherine leave,

15:04.959 --> 15:06.425
I'll give you what you want.

15:06.460 --> 15:09.430
I will admit to everyone
that I'm willing truly a fraud.

15:09.465 --> 15:11.171
And it was you who saved the world.

15:11.727 --> 15:14.765
- You'd do that?
- On my word as a gentleman.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.228
No, Gil!
Don't let him force you to lie.

15:17.263 --> 15:20.357
That's just it,
honey pip, it's not a lie.

15:21.044 --> 15:22.693
<i>He really did save us.</i>

15:24.127 --> 15:25.496
Let him go.

15:26.262 --> 15:29.328
<i>I will release the lady
after your confession.</i>

15:33.942 --> 15:36.712
Now, let's set the
recordium straight.

15:40.319 --> 15:43.494
<i>Hello, my name is
Gil Broome Esquire.</i>

15:43.529 --> 15:46.101
<i>Or as you know me,
Steam Lantern.</i>

15:46.136 --> 15:47.505
<i>I'm a fraud.</i>

15:47.993 --> 15:50.170
<i>It was Duke Nigel who
saved the world from</i>

15:50.171 --> 15:52.348
the Space Dragoon known
as the Anti-Monitor.

15:52.831 --> 15:55.039
<i>His deal with the
monster spared us all.</i>

15:55.711 --> 15:59.072
<i>I fear I've tarred a good man's
name in Duke Nigel Thortonberry.</i>

15:59.587 --> 16:02.276
Everyone was so pleased
with me, and you...

16:02.747 --> 16:04.844
Well, I liked how
proud of me you were.

16:05.736 --> 16:09.680
Oh Gil, I've been proud to be your
girl since we were sweethearts.

16:09.715 --> 16:11.496
Nothing will ever change that.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.553
<i>- Steam! Steam!
- What is that?</i>

16:14.588 --> 16:17.243
- What are they saying?
<i>- Steam! Steam!</i>

16:17.278 --> 16:19.317
<i>Steam! Steam! Steam!</i>

16:19.352 --> 16:22.854
What? How?
Why?

16:22.889 --> 16:25.382
<i>Because people recognize
a hero when they see one.</i>

16:27.940 --> 16:30.184
Whether Gil knows it or not,
he is a hero.

16:30.493 --> 16:33.069
People would rather die
fighting than live crawling.

16:33.104 --> 16:35.294
<i>They appreciate his efforts against you.</i>

16:35.677 --> 16:39.034
Against me?
I'm not the villain here.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.502
I only created my
mechanoids to bring the

16:41.503 --> 16:43.935
people any news I had
in a timely manner.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.023
<i>Unh. Unh.</i>

16:48.007 --> 16:50.730
[music]

16:55.282 --> 16:57.967
Oh my, what have I done?

16:59.120 --> 17:02.680
I am the villain.
Stand down.

17:02.715 --> 17:04.673
<i>You're all... free to go.</i>

17:22.551 --> 17:25.214
And now my failure is complete.

17:25.537 --> 17:27.909
<i>While the Anti-Monitor did
not harm our planet,</i>

17:27.944 --> 17:31.960
it ate most of the nuclear atomic
fuel in our sun before it left.

17:31.995 --> 17:33.391
It tricked me.

17:33.873 --> 17:38.088
I didn't save the world, I merely
postponed it's demise a few months.

17:38.739 --> 17:42.297
This at the price of trillions
of lives in another Universe!

17:43.224 --> 17:46.492
It seems I am a most
despicable person in not one,

17:46.527 --> 17:48.614
but two entire Universes.

17:49.186 --> 17:52.188
Can you forgive me?
In the short bit we have left?

17:52.689 --> 17:53.932
Of course.

17:53.967 --> 17:56.344
- Time for one last tea then.
- Quite.

17:56.422 --> 17:59.041
Whoa! Whoa!
There's no time for tea now.

17:59.524 --> 18:01.187
Right!
How selfish of us.

18:01.222 --> 18:04.587
We may be doomed, but our friend Hal
Jordan should not share our fate.

18:04.622 --> 18:07.809
It was your ray, Professor,
that sent the Dragoon to his Universe.

18:07.844 --> 18:10.975
Can you help Mr. Jordan find
his way home in the same manner?

18:11.010 --> 18:11.967
Yes.

18:12.002 --> 18:15.477
Draining the remaining power from
the world gridiron should provide

18:15.478 --> 18:18.952
the energy to cut through the
fabric of this Universe once more,

18:18.987 --> 18:21.646
before our planet freezes
into a lifeless ball of ice.

18:21.681 --> 18:22.714
For the best, then.

18:22.715 --> 18:25.816
Don't think I want to live
on a world without a sunrise.

18:25.851 --> 18:29.025
Me neither. How'd we known
when it was time for tea?

18:29.621 --> 18:31.728
Oh, enough with the
stiff-upper-lippery!

18:31.733 --> 18:34.324
No one is gonna die on my watch!

18:36.286 --> 18:39.314
[music]
[machines whirring]

18:42.155 --> 18:43.855
[ring beeping]

18:43.881 --> 18:45.256
<i>Everything all right?</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:46.970
Yeah, sure, nothing
to worry about.

18:47.005 --> 18:50.060
Plenty of power left.
It'll be a walk in the park.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.081
We're in position.
Duke Nigel?

18:52.116 --> 18:55.417
<i>By the map of their Universe that
Green Lantern Jordan provided,</i>

18:55.452 --> 18:58.898
<i>I believe I know the coordinates
where the new rip must be made.</i>

18:58.933 --> 19:01.613
<i>But to create a fissure in space
the size you've asked for,</i>

19:01.648 --> 19:03.677
<i>there's only power to do it once.</i>

19:03.712 --> 19:05.887
Then, my equipment
will burn out for good.

19:05.922 --> 19:08.592
This is our only option,
so let's make it count.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.192
I'm in position, fire the ray!

19:16.975 --> 19:18.347
Firing!

19:18.068 --> 19:21.616
[static beams]
[fire]

19:25.431 --> 19:28.043
[whirring]

19:31.264 --> 19:35.221
[triumphant music]

19:43.787 --> 19:47.797
[music continues]

20:05.500 --> 20:09.176
[whooshing]

20:13.945 --> 20:16.385
Oh, now is not a good
time to run out of juice!

20:16.420 --> 20:18.195
Come on, we can do it!

20:23.398 --> 20:26.148
[whoosing]

20:32.960 --> 20:36.053
Green Lantern! We're through,
and it's brilliant here!

20:42.962 --> 20:45.495
[groans]

21:06.560 --> 21:08.533
You know?
This isn't bad!

21:08.568 --> 21:10.815
<i>I believe I have
found your friends.</i>

21:10.850 --> 21:13.628
<i>One of whom is quite
an angry fellow.</i>

21:14.284 --> 21:17.349
<i>So help me if this is some
kind of joke, I'll come over and...</i>

21:17.384 --> 21:19.425
Ain't no joke Kilowog, we made it.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.252
<i>Hal, what do you mean by "we"?</i>

21:21.287 --> 21:24.370
<i>Me and a couple billion new friends.</i>
