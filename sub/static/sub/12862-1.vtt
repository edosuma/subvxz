03:07.650 --> 03:10.813
Come on, boys.

03:11.487 --> 03:15.104
Hey, Captain, why the haste?
The city will not vanish.

03:15.275 --> 03:20.780
It is not the city of Charak he wishes
to see, but someone who dwells within.

03:21.628 --> 03:23.605
After a long voyage
it's good to stretch one's legs.

03:23.698 --> 03:27.279
The only good thing about this port
is the inn of Abu Jamil.

03:27.396 --> 03:30.722
I have been dreaming of
his roasted sheep's eyes.

03:30.861 --> 03:35.579
- And I of the eyes of his daughter.
- You're dreaming of more than her eyes.

03:43.971 --> 03:48.467
- Captain, my mouth is dry.
- Let's sample the wines of Charak.

03:48.642 --> 03:52.260
- My thirst is of a thousand men.
- If you drink, you'll go no further.

03:52.437 --> 03:56.138
- Remember the last time?
- You were stripped of your possessions!

03:56.316 --> 04:00.231
Because of that I added
four more eunuchs to the population.

04:00.404 --> 04:03.191
Allah be with you.
All the paradise I seek is here.

04:03.365 --> 04:07.030
Who wants anything more?
I shall stay behind.

04:11.123 --> 04:14.871
All silent, no sound, no lights...
A city of ghosts.

04:15.043 --> 04:18.827
- Why is the gate closed?
- Curfew is not until midnight.

04:19.005 --> 04:21.923
No sentries about.

04:26.346 --> 04:30.474
Ho there! Captain of the watch!
Open the gate!

04:30.642 --> 04:35.020
- Wake, wake, wake, wake!
- It's Sinbad, friend of caliph Kassim!

04:35.189 --> 04:38.392
And a better friend
to the Princess Farah!

04:38.567 --> 04:42.018
- Captain Sinbad.
- You know me?

04:42.196 --> 04:46.525
I am a merchant. I hope to purchase
some of the cargo you'll unload tomorrow.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.452
No one is admitted to Charak after sunset.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.989
- But why?
- The plague. Many have died.

04:53.165 --> 04:56.748
Every time we reach this port
some misfortune strikes us!

04:56.919 --> 05:01.664
- The caliph Kassim and his sister?
- They're well. But he's not caliph yet.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.624
I was told in Jerash that
Kassim's father died three months ago.

05:05.803 --> 05:07.961
Kassim has not yet been crowned.

05:08.138 --> 05:12.006
- We'd better return to the ship.
- Yes, let's sell our cargo elsewhere.

05:12.184 --> 05:15.600
I'm not leaving Charak
until I see Princess Farah and Kassim.

05:15.771 --> 05:18.641
- Is there another way into the town?
- No.

05:18.816 --> 05:22.398
But if you wish to take the risk
you may enter at daybreak.

05:22.569 --> 05:25.654
Until then I can offer to relieve
your disappointment.

05:25.823 --> 05:29.441
My tent has wine, food and music.
My people are your servants.

05:29.618 --> 05:31.907
Please, be welcome.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.123
Come.

06:26.884 --> 06:32.340
Hassan, don't drink!
The wine is poisoned. Help Aboo-Seer.

06:50.783 --> 06:54.863
Who are you?
Why have you tried to poison us?

07:10.552 --> 07:15.048
From the depths of the earth,
I command you: Arise!

07:25.234 --> 07:28.437
Destroy them!
Kill Sinbad!

08:50.194 --> 08:52.435
Everyone back to the ship!

09:33.195 --> 09:35.733
Captain Sinbad! ...Wait.

09:35.906 --> 09:38.479
Princess Farah!

09:38.659 --> 09:40.327
Quickly.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.159
Praise to Allah that I found you.
I must talk to you.

09:45.332 --> 09:47.657
Not here, not now.

09:48.877 --> 09:51.914
And no going back that way.
Come with me.

10:02.766 --> 10:07.393
Keep rowing back to the ship!
Keep rowing, keep rowing!

10:12.192 --> 10:14.315
Make for the open sea!

10:14.486 --> 10:18.235
- Hoist the mainsail... do it!
- But the shoals, Captain.

10:18.407 --> 10:21.242
We will risk them, there is a full moon.

10:21.410 --> 10:24.660
We'll lie offshore
and not return until daybreak.

10:24.830 --> 10:27.119
- You will go back?
- At dawn.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.508
Warm yourself.

10:43.098 --> 10:45.340
Here, take this.

11:11.543 --> 11:16.086
Drink this.
You were searching for me. Why?

11:16.256 --> 11:19.423
I was told of your return.
I need help desperately.

11:19.593 --> 11:25.881
- My brother is in great danger.
- Prince Kassim? I owe him my life.

11:26.058 --> 11:30.387
A spell has been cast upon him.
My uncle Balsora will tell you.

11:30.562 --> 11:34.227
- Why not you?
- I beg of you, do not leave Charak!

11:34.399 --> 11:39.145
- Trust me for my brother's sake.
- For him I would risk my life.

11:39.321 --> 11:42.073
For you... I would give it.

11:43.325 --> 11:46.243
- I was told there was plague.
- Not true.

11:46.411 --> 11:51.916
Balsora rules the city by day...
but by night fear rules Charak.

11:52.084 --> 11:56.876
- People whisper of witchcraft.
- How can I help?

11:57.047 --> 12:01.626
- You will find a way.
- Come... lie down.

12:04.096 --> 12:08.592
- I prayed every day for your return.
- It's been almost a year.

12:08.767 --> 12:12.599
- I was not willing to give up the sea.
- Nor I my life at court.

12:12.771 --> 12:16.555
- Now I've decided to live on land.
- And I to live at sea.

12:17.526 --> 12:21.737
I have returned to Charak to ask Kassim
for your hand. Will you consent?

12:21.905 --> 12:23.779
Willingly.

12:23.949 --> 12:28.326
But only when my brother is able to
stand before you and give his consent.

12:28.495 --> 12:33.157
- When he is himself again.
- Himself?

12:39.131 --> 12:43.757
After my father's death,
Allah protect his soul...

12:43.927 --> 12:48.091
The astrologers had decided that the
first full moon would be auspicious -

12:48.265 --> 12:50.886
- for the coronation of my brother.

12:51.059 --> 12:54.263
On the day of the ceremony,
the procession began, -

12:54.438 --> 12:59.349
- but even as the crown
was being placed upon his head...

13:01.779 --> 13:03.655
Lie back.

13:03.864 --> 13:08.158
It was the last time I saw him
as the Kassim I've known all my life.

13:08.327 --> 13:12.027
Young, handsome...
a true prince.

13:13.707 --> 13:16.578
You talked of a spell...

13:17.669 --> 13:22.296
- Or has he fallen victim to the plague?
- Worse than a thousand plagues!

13:22.466 --> 13:25.301
Do not talk of it now.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.122
Hassan, where is the Captain?

13:59.294 --> 14:01.832
- What is it?
- His Excellency is here!

14:02.005 --> 14:03.998
The Vizier Balsora.

14:04.675 --> 14:07.213
Ask the princess to come on deck.

14:21.024 --> 14:25.153
- Excellency.
- Captain... welcome again to Charak.

14:26.780 --> 14:30.066
There she is...
may Allah's name be exalted.

14:30.242 --> 14:34.074
I prayed that Princess Farah
might reach you safely last night.

14:34.246 --> 14:37.282
- Has she told you?
- Yes, this morning.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.995
But is it true, Excellency?

14:41.378 --> 14:43.335
Let's go on board.

14:43.505 --> 14:46.672
My beloved child.
Praise be to Allah you are safe.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.626
Hassan, food and drink for our guests.
The rest of you, back to work.

14:50.804 --> 14:54.932
- You have told him of our misfortune.
- But is it true, Excellency?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.342
Tragically, horribly.

14:57.519 --> 15:01.303
We have consulted
all the wisest men and skilled doctors.

15:01.482 --> 15:05.526
- They can do nothing.
- Come. Sit down.

15:09.907 --> 15:13.192
You have travelled to many lands,
help us.

15:13.368 --> 15:17.366
- Perhaps there is someone somewhere.
- I will do all in my power to help.

15:17.539 --> 15:20.908
But this requires skills
far greater than mine.

15:21.084 --> 15:26.459
It needs an understanding of the black
arts, a great alchemist, a magician.

15:27.674 --> 15:31.458
Wait... Yes, I have heard of
such a man, if he still lives.

15:31.637 --> 15:33.345
- Who?
- A Greek.

15:33.514 --> 15:37.214
Some say the wisest man in the world.
His name is...

15:37.392 --> 15:41.176
- Hassan, you remember.
- Melanthius! The hermit of...

15:41.355 --> 15:43.394
- Maroof?
- Casgar.

15:43.565 --> 15:45.854
A remote haunted island.

15:46.026 --> 15:48.398
- Have you been there?
- No.

15:48.570 --> 15:51.737
His deeds are legendary,
but he may not even exist.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.315
The island is ringed with deadly reefs.

15:54.493 --> 15:57.529
- You must take us to him.
- It would be dangerous.

15:57.704 --> 16:00.195
I cannot allow you to go.

16:00.374 --> 16:05.166
Unless Prince Kassim is crowned
before the passing of seven moons, -

16:05.337 --> 16:08.587
- he will lose forever
his right to be caliph.

16:08.757 --> 16:12.007
- Melanthius is our only hope.
- Some say he's mad.

16:12.177 --> 16:15.427
The island savages eat human flesh
and worship him.

16:15.597 --> 16:17.554
I will send treasure.

16:17.724 --> 16:21.425
Gold and precious jewels for you,
your crew and Melanthius, -

16:21.603 --> 16:24.225
- if only he can restore my nephew.

16:24.398 --> 16:28.146
Should I undertake this voyage,
it would not be for gold or jewels, -

16:28.318 --> 16:31.272
- but for a treasure far more precious.

16:35.576 --> 16:39.870
Oh, my beloved son.
May Allah preserve you.

16:49.673 --> 16:52.246
Keep those horses steady!

16:58.056 --> 17:01.805
- Who is that?
- Zenobia, my stepmother. She hates me!

17:01.977 --> 17:07.054
- She was not at court.
- My mother died when I was born.

17:09.693 --> 17:12.896
It is said Zenobia is a witch
and willed her death.

17:13.070 --> 17:14.944
Allah protect us! Why is she here?

17:18.117 --> 17:22.780
Be on your guard, Sinbad,
she's more dangerous than a scorpion!

17:24.750 --> 17:26.907
Queen, may Allah's blessings be on thee.

17:27.085 --> 17:30.704
We meet at last, Captain.
What brings you back?

17:30.881 --> 17:34.214
To deliver my cargo...
and to visit my friend Kassim.

17:34.384 --> 17:38.003
- And his sister?
- I am bound by love to them both.

17:38.180 --> 17:41.549
I intend to ask the caliph Kassim
for the hand of Princess Farah.

17:41.725 --> 17:44.181
There's no caliph
to consent to your marriage.

17:44.353 --> 17:47.971
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
Nor is he likely to be.

17:48.148 --> 17:51.648
I have been told of the events
at the coronation.

17:51.819 --> 17:53.858
I shall help if I can.

17:54.029 --> 17:57.694
Kassim is beyond help.
Do not be blinded by love.

17:57.866 --> 18:02.528
Balsora must be made to understand
no one can help him.

18:02.704 --> 18:05.242
- I shall tell him.
- Do not provoke her!

18:05.415 --> 18:08.867
Why do you interfere?
You can do nothing for Kassim.

18:09.044 --> 18:12.627
- Captain Sinbad can help us.
- I implore you, be silent.

18:12.798 --> 18:14.874
What can you do -

18:15.050 --> 18:19.878
- when they've consulted all the wise men,
doctors, priests, astrologers?

18:22.266 --> 18:25.931
- There may be another.
- No one! Abandon this false hope.

18:26.103 --> 18:29.139
- Kassim is doomed forever.
- You lie. You want him doomed.

18:29.314 --> 18:33.478
Within the passing of seven moons,
if Kassim is not crowned caliph, -

18:33.652 --> 18:36.357
- he will lose his right forever.

18:36.530 --> 18:39.815
You bewitched him.
You want your son Rafi to be caliph!

18:39.992 --> 18:43.158
Let me cut the smile from her face!
Let me go!

18:43.328 --> 18:45.368
You'll bring an eternal curse on us -

18:45.539 --> 18:49.406
- if you draw one drop of blood
from any member of the royal family.

18:49.585 --> 18:52.502
It's only for that
she hasn't murdered Kassim!

18:52.671 --> 18:57.000
As cunning as a snake, as malicious
as a shark. Rafi will never be caliph!

18:57.176 --> 19:00.924
- There is no one to prevent it.
- Melanthius will prevent it.

19:05.309 --> 19:10.018
Melanthius is a myth and his powers
are a legend. He does not exist.

19:10.189 --> 19:15.527
We shall soon discover if the myth
and the legend exist. We sail tonight.

19:15.694 --> 19:18.315
My beloved,
may your days always be blessed.

19:18.489 --> 19:21.739
Sail for Rhodes or Tripoli,
you'll find richer cargo there.

19:21.909 --> 19:27.532
Set sail in search for Melanthius
and you'll set a course for damnation!

19:27.706 --> 19:31.870
Aboo-seer, Hassan, Bahadin.
Prepare the ship for sea.

19:32.044 --> 19:35.164
Order your men
to bring treasure for Melanthius.

19:38.926 --> 19:41.333
We sail for Casgar.

19:43.639 --> 19:47.304
One thing I advise...
Set a careful watch on Zenobia.

19:47.476 --> 19:50.512
I will have my men watch her castle
by day and by night.

19:50.687 --> 19:54.103
Zabid will be in command.
He's the best soldier I have.

20:15.546 --> 20:20.788
My son, Sinbad has agreed
to help them. We must act quickly.

20:20.968 --> 20:25.428
He has taken them to the Isle of Casgar
to consult the great sage Melanthius.

20:25.597 --> 20:27.590
- Is the heart ready?
- Yes.

20:27.766 --> 20:30.518
You said no one can help Kassim.

20:30.686 --> 20:33.259
Exquisite, my son.

20:33.438 --> 20:37.187
If Melanthius truly lives,
he is the one person who could.

20:37.359 --> 20:41.902
You promised me. I am to be caliph. You
swore Kassim would never inherit Charak!

20:42.072 --> 20:45.073
- I shall prevent it.
- How?

20:45.242 --> 20:49.951
Sinbad has a ship, a crew.
Balsora has the palace guards.

20:50.122 --> 20:52.447
We shall have other forces
at our command.

20:52.624 --> 20:57.666
More powerful than a palace guard
and a lovesick sea Captain and his crew.

20:59.256 --> 21:03.301
That... will be our army.

21:11.226 --> 21:14.891
Quickly as you can.
We must be away before nightfall.

21:16.648 --> 21:21.856
- Take that box in my cabin.
- Carefully, I implore you!

21:30.871 --> 21:34.703
It's a baboon!
What a beautiful specimen.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.879
Get back to work
or I'll make baboons of you!

21:39.046 --> 21:42.130
Does he do any tricks, Princess?

21:45.385 --> 21:49.300
There, there...
They mean no harm.

22:04.488 --> 22:06.777
O brave and proud bull -

22:06.949 --> 22:12.109
- whose mighty heart my son
has fashioned of purest gold.

22:12.287 --> 22:17.792
Beat... with the power
as only I command you.

22:19.461 --> 22:21.952
I made it perfect in every detail.

22:22.131 --> 22:27.801
O mighty Abu Salem...
you who rule over a thousand devils, -

22:27.970 --> 22:31.220
- by all the fires
of hell and darkness, -

22:31.390 --> 22:35.719
- give strength and life
to this your creature.

22:35.894 --> 22:40.274
Minaton... Minaton...

22:44.445 --> 22:46.113
Perfect!

22:49.867 --> 22:55.656
A colossus of bronze...
and mine to command.

22:57.958 --> 23:00.366
- Hear anything?
- Nothing.

23:04.381 --> 23:08.213
Keep awake! Orders are
to keep a watch on Zenobia's castle.

23:08.385 --> 23:11.172
Or I'll slit your throat.

23:27.029 --> 23:29.105
The wind is dying.

24:23.669 --> 24:26.456
A baboon that can play chess?

24:29.007 --> 24:30.676
Go away!

24:33.637 --> 24:36.210
- He's frightened of you.
- I'm frightened of him.

24:36.390 --> 24:40.388
He attacked me.
Baboons can turn savage, you know.

24:40.561 --> 24:44.808
He is not savage!
I command you to go away.

24:44.982 --> 24:48.849
Is he a gift for the wise man of Casgar
to play chess with?

24:49.027 --> 24:50.696
Go away!

24:54.950 --> 24:56.693
Hassan, get back to your work.

24:56.869 --> 25:01.744
- But Captain, the beast was playing...
- ...chess, he has beaten me twice.

25:04.084 --> 25:07.833
He is not really a baboon.

25:09.756 --> 25:14.917
He was transformed by the black arts
of Queen Zenobia's witchcraft.

25:16.513 --> 25:19.514
He is... Prince Kassim.

25:24.646 --> 25:27.434
Can you be certain
that it is not the princess -

25:27.608 --> 25:31.107
- who has been bewitched to believe
this animal is a prince?

25:31.278 --> 25:33.567
He is my brother.

25:40.579 --> 25:41.622
Look!

25:46.001 --> 25:48.504
I am Kassim.

25:54.176 --> 25:57.260
Now do you believe?

26:02.518 --> 26:04.178
What is it?

26:05.562 --> 26:07.804
What could it be?

26:23.872 --> 26:26.873
A ship that moves without sails!

26:42.099 --> 26:45.100
He seems to be rowing for six men.

26:49.106 --> 26:51.775
Come on, let's try to get aboard.

26:57.448 --> 27:00.152
Hurry, it's moving out to sea.

27:07.916 --> 27:09.873
A fishing boat.

27:11.503 --> 27:13.710
Spies of Balsora!

27:15.299 --> 27:20.044
Minaton...
Wheel head into them.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.768
It's Zenobia!

27:41.200 --> 27:44.818
For the love of Allah, row!
Row, will you!

27:46.914 --> 27:50.117
Row, you thickheads, row!

27:52.628 --> 27:55.000
It's witchcraft!

27:55.881 --> 28:00.626
- Save yourselves!
- Ram them, I said. Ram them!

28:06.475 --> 28:09.180
Mercy! Save me!

28:09.353 --> 28:12.437
Minaton... Minaton.

28:17.528 --> 28:19.900
Wait... wait!

28:47.599 --> 28:49.925
And now for Casgar.

28:50.853 --> 28:53.474
North by north-east.

28:59.611 --> 29:01.900
I see nothing.

29:02.072 --> 29:04.148
Breaker ahead!

29:13.041 --> 29:17.288
The rocks and the reefs
will be invisible.

29:20.299 --> 29:23.134
It'll be impossible to land.

29:23.302 --> 29:26.967
- I have an excellent idea.
- Yes?

29:27.139 --> 29:29.546
Let's turn back.

29:31.101 --> 29:34.221
- Lower the rowing boat.
- Aye aye, Captain.

30:01.715 --> 30:04.253
Hassan, keep up!

30:05.844 --> 30:08.929
Stay close together, move!

30:43.715 --> 30:44.758
Rest.

30:51.557 --> 30:54.511
How can you be sure
where to find Melanthius?

30:54.685 --> 30:59.181
This is a path.
There are tracks. Signs.

31:02.526 --> 31:05.099
Forward, men!

31:58.373 --> 31:59.625
There!

32:02.377 --> 32:04.951
A great pillar.

32:08.133 --> 32:12.712
- Must be a holy place.
- Built by a people of great skill.

32:21.063 --> 32:25.476
- What can it be?
- A temple perhaps.

32:25.651 --> 32:28.224
It seems to be carved out of solid rock.

32:28.403 --> 32:30.894
Could be there is treasure in it.

32:31.073 --> 32:34.027
Could be the castle of Melanthius!

32:48.966 --> 32:53.762
Melanthius! Melanthius!

32:59.059 --> 33:01.811
I will see if anyone is there.

33:07.985 --> 33:11.401
- They'll kill us!
- Run for the wall!

33:31.508 --> 33:34.178
They will not harm you now.

33:35.762 --> 33:38.170
Have you been shipwrecked?

33:38.348 --> 33:41.967
No, my ship is anchored safely.
I am Captain Sinbad.

33:42.144 --> 33:45.394
Only those who were wrecked
have landed here before.

33:45.564 --> 33:48.316
But the Casgar people
always found them first.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.603
We seek the wise man
known as Melanthius.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.483
Does he truly exist?

33:55.616 --> 33:58.819
- Does he live on this island?
- Why do you seek him?

33:58.994 --> 34:02.908
It is a matter of
great urgency and importance.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.925
Go!

34:15.344 --> 34:17.638
Go, I said!

34:35.572 --> 34:40.400
This is Princess Farah
from the distant city of Charak.

34:42.286 --> 34:44.494
I am Dione.

34:45.541 --> 34:49.621
- Come.
- But Melanthius... does he exist?

34:49.795 --> 34:51.880
Follow me.

35:10.774 --> 35:14.642
Truly incredible!
A magnificent city.

35:14.820 --> 35:17.489
But completely deserted.
Who built it all?

35:17.656 --> 35:21.440
- The ancestors of the natives.
- What happened to them?

35:21.618 --> 35:25.367
They became too civilised
and destroyed each other.

35:25.539 --> 35:28.575
Is that where the savages live?

35:28.750 --> 35:32.618
Those are
the tombs of their forefathers.

35:32.796 --> 35:37.043
- And those buildings to the right?
- Tombs of kings.

35:37.217 --> 35:39.708
There is someone there.

35:41.346 --> 35:44.466
Is that the great Melanthius?

36:09.208 --> 36:12.374
Yes, father... I will.

36:15.047 --> 36:17.170
Melanthius will see you.

36:17.341 --> 36:20.092
- How did you?
- My father taught me.

36:20.260 --> 36:26.133
He calls it "telepathia". A Greek word
for communication of the mind.

36:27.017 --> 36:29.888
Come, follow me.

36:47.788 --> 36:51.239
- Master Melanthius.
- You're a brave man, Captain Sinbad.

36:51.416 --> 36:55.913
And a remarkable navigator
to have landed on Casgar safely.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.377
Only for that have I agreed to see you.

36:58.549 --> 37:04.135
Well, thank you... but I still
don't understand how you know who I am.

37:04.304 --> 37:08.349
The mind is an extraordinary thing.
Thought is transferable.

37:08.517 --> 37:11.471
It can travel through space,
even to the stars.

37:11.645 --> 37:16.852
But the method needs time, patience
and a skilful daughter.

37:17.025 --> 37:20.311
What have you got in there?
Tell me.

37:20.487 --> 37:24.105
- It's a cage holding...
- Wait! Don't tell me.

37:24.283 --> 37:28.031
It's an arboreal anthropoid
of the genus papio.

37:28.203 --> 37:31.738
- No, it's a baboon!
- That's what I said, a baboon.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.793
- What a dear little fellow.
- Careful!

37:35.961 --> 37:38.915
He can be savage with everyone
but the princess.

37:39.089 --> 37:42.541
As a species they are
aggressive and of low intelligence.

37:42.718 --> 37:46.965
- He trusts only me.
- He looks so unhappy, poor creature.

37:48.223 --> 37:49.892
Careful!

38:05.657 --> 38:10.403
- It is the baboon about whom...
...you wish to see me. Yes, I know.

38:10.579 --> 38:16.083
I suggest we continue below
in my laboratory, out of the sun.

38:45.739 --> 38:48.693
You claim
it can write and play chess?

38:48.867 --> 38:53.695
It, my brother, was a brilliant chess
player from the age of seven.

38:55.332 --> 38:58.084
Dione, fetch me a mirror.

38:58.252 --> 39:03.044
As a scientist and alchemist
I know that metals can be transformed, -

39:05.300 --> 39:09.594
- but as a philosopher...
Easy, fellow, easy.

39:09.763 --> 39:16.098
I can also believe in the possibility of
...metaphysical change.

39:21.066 --> 39:23.106
Thank you, Dione.

39:24.778 --> 39:27.898
Let him see his face.

39:28.073 --> 39:29.324
Go on!

39:59.521 --> 40:02.232
He's weeping.

40:11.408 --> 40:13.484
By all the gods!

40:13.660 --> 40:18.655
A true baboon would have attacked
its reflection, thinking it an enemy.

40:18.832 --> 40:24.538
It would not have recognised itself
and been moved to grief.

40:33.722 --> 40:37.305
I am very happy to meet you,
Prince Kassim.

41:14.805 --> 41:17.011
The oars...

41:18.600 --> 41:21.637
Rafi, what has happened?

41:21.812 --> 41:24.137
The oars are smashed.

41:24.314 --> 41:27.683
It will take hours to repair. Quickly!

41:27.860 --> 41:30.777
Sinbad found a way through.

41:37.536 --> 41:41.320
Whatever drug or elixir it was
that this woman...

41:41.498 --> 41:43.167
Zenobia.

41:43.417 --> 41:47.165
Whatever it was she used
is the most powerful black magic -

41:47.337 --> 41:50.422
- and is beyond my knowledge.

41:50.591 --> 41:55.300
You see, unfortunately,
time is on her side.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.471
Perhaps the prince
would like some of these.

42:03.353 --> 42:06.271
Real apes are mostly vegetarian.

42:06.440 --> 42:10.769
- How does he like his fruit?
- He does. He likes them.

42:10.944 --> 42:12.142
I thought he would.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.986
- Dione, where is the mint tea?
- Coming, father.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.872
I brought him something.

42:27.044 --> 42:30.377
Bananas... he likes those.

42:34.009 --> 42:36.761
I'll serve the tea.

43:02.830 --> 43:07.954
What did you mean when you said that
time was on the side of Queen Zenobia?

43:08.127 --> 43:12.420
The longer that transformation
is delayed, the more likely -

43:12.589 --> 43:17.132
- Kassim is to lose those
human qualities that remain to him.

43:18.470 --> 43:21.507
Then there is no hope for my brother?

43:25.394 --> 43:27.303
Now, wait...

43:27.479 --> 43:32.521
There was a time when men knew how
to combat this form of black witchcraft.

43:32.693 --> 43:37.651
A nation with an intelligence far
superior to anything we know today.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.907
They knew
the secret of transforming matter.

43:41.076 --> 43:44.279
Dione,
help me find the Arimaspi scrolls.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.328
The Arimaspi?

43:46.498 --> 43:50.745
Yes, Archimedes of Syracuse,
a very dear friend of mine.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.917
He based many of his inventions
on principles originally developed -

43:55.090 --> 43:58.008
- by Arimaspi mathematicians.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.552
Here they are!

43:59.720 --> 44:02.341
Invaluable manuscripts... Where are they?

44:02.514 --> 44:04.590
I've found them.

44:06.435 --> 44:10.848
Yes, these are the ones.
Clear the table.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.854
These scrolls are
more than two thousand years old.

44:17.029 --> 44:20.564
- There we are.
- What do they say?

44:21.617 --> 44:25.531
This first one... will be
of special interest to you, Captain.

44:25.704 --> 44:29.322
It's sailing directions.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.991
The first written authority.

44:32.169 --> 44:36.167
The only way to restore Kassim is to
undertake a journey to their country?

44:36.340 --> 44:39.175
A journey to Hyperborea,
the land of the Arimaspi, -

44:39.343 --> 44:42.878
- is the only possible way
of restoring Prince Kassim.

44:43.055 --> 44:45.261
These scrolls confirm the legend.

44:45.432 --> 44:49.430
It tells of a warm and green valley at
the northernmost point of the world -

44:49.603 --> 44:51.928
- surrounded by wide seas of ice.

44:52.105 --> 44:55.854
There in the valley of Hyperborea,
the Arimaspi built a shrine.

44:56.026 --> 44:59.775
The shrine of the four elements:
Earth, fire, air and water.

44:59.947 --> 45:04.525
Within that shrine is the source
of all their extraordinary power.

45:04.701 --> 45:09.114
This power enabled them to preserve
their valley against the glacier -

45:09.289 --> 45:13.204
- and to change or transform
the nature of matter.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.331
I have been experimenting
with a similar power.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.506
- Is there truly such a valley?
- Beyond a doubt.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.426
Then how soon can you be ready to sail?

45:22.594 --> 45:27.090
The journey would be impossible!
It's the coldest region in the world!

45:27.266 --> 45:31.477
Cold, certainly. Difficult and
dangerous, perhaps, but not impossible.

45:31.645 --> 45:34.765
We have you to interpret the scrolls.

45:34.940 --> 45:38.143
I'm too old!
Besides there's so little time.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.358
Come with us, Melanthius.

45:40.529 --> 45:45.274
It can't be this noble prince shall
spend the rest of his days in a cage.

45:45.451 --> 45:49.662
The shrine is his one chance. You're
the only one that can lead us there!

45:49.830 --> 45:51.657
Please, say you will.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.537
- Where did you find that?
- With the scrolls.

45:54.710 --> 45:59.253
The key! The only means of opening
the door to the shrine.

45:59.423 --> 46:05.544
Hyperborea... to visit the shrine,
examine the very source of life.

46:05.721 --> 46:09.469
Archimedes would
split himself with envy.

46:09.641 --> 46:12.891
Now, everyone, stand well back!

46:33.540 --> 46:38.498
Imagine that power a million times
greater used not for evil, but for good.

46:38.670 --> 46:43.297
That is what the Arimaspi have left us!
Yes, I will go with you.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.918
- Thank you!
- Yes, by all the gods, I will.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.809
No way of reading the sun.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.271
Cloud and fog.

47:18.043 --> 47:20.415
Hurry, hurry!

47:25.717 --> 47:27.177
Listen!

47:32.057 --> 47:35.391
They are leaving!

47:35.561 --> 47:38.894
Hurry! We must follow them.

47:47.573 --> 47:52.484
With a following wind to drive us,
we should be many leagues into the...

47:58.000 --> 48:01.784
And into the Western Ocean
before the next full moon.

48:01.962 --> 48:04.998
- Why not sooner?
- Not possible.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.885
Time is our enemy on all counts!

48:13.932 --> 48:18.974
At the moment Kassim is still in
possession of certain human qualities.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.981
The longer
the transformation is delayed, -

48:22.149 --> 48:25.600
- the more he'll revert
to a baboon's natural behaviour.

48:25.778 --> 48:30.736
More aggressive, savage, dangerous.
He may never be Kassim again.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.656
We are under full sail.
I can do no more.

48:34.828 --> 48:38.778
It is believed that there is
a swift ocean current due north -

48:38.957 --> 48:41.448
- across the Casgars.

48:50.219 --> 48:54.430
North! They're moving north
towards the Celtic Isles, but why?

48:54.598 --> 48:58.465
We should be close to Sinbad's ship.
Keep a lookout.

49:06.485 --> 49:10.530
I must know
what advice the Greek gave them.

49:10.697 --> 49:14.612
I must know what they mean to do.

49:26.296 --> 49:27.965
I can't!

49:35.472 --> 49:40.015
It was powerful enough
to transform Kassim.

49:40.185 --> 49:42.344
I must know.

49:57.286 --> 50:01.039
Now... by Hecate -

50:02.749 --> 50:07.661
- and all the secrets of darkness
and forces of hell.

50:08.797 --> 50:09.840
Come!

51:10.400 --> 51:14.778
Captain Sinbad!
Is there no way of increasing our speed?

51:14.947 --> 51:17.520
A ship can only sail as fast
as the wind allows.

51:17.699 --> 51:23.654
I'll have to consult the chart again...
Now the moon is on the wane.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.661
No, no, no...
If you study my design, -

51:28.836 --> 51:33.379
- you'll see there's more curve
in the runners. The snow will be deep.

51:33.549 --> 51:36.633
But I have never seen snow, Master.

51:46.103 --> 51:49.388
Here, let me try it.
I shall join you in a few minutes.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.438
Maroof, the chart!

51:57.906 --> 52:00.362
Here, sharpen this.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.785
Bahadin,
more ropeties for the sledges.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.534
The cargo nets will need to be prepared.

52:13.714 --> 52:16.465
Everything as strong,
but as light as possible.

52:16.633 --> 52:19.587
Hassan, I told you
to get that knife sharpened!

52:19.761 --> 52:23.890
No, you must try.
You can do better, you know you can.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.431
No, Kassim, not like that.

52:30.772 --> 52:33.939
The other way around.

52:34.735 --> 52:36.820
Like that.

52:37.988 --> 52:42.401
Very well, as you're so bad-tempered,
no more writing today.

53:07.476 --> 53:08.936
Baboon!

53:37.589 --> 53:40.080
Kassim, be quiet.

53:42.511 --> 53:46.129
Your friend is very disobedient today.

54:17.629 --> 54:22.505
- Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!
- Will you be still!

54:36.106 --> 54:39.107
Father, why is he behaving like that?

54:47.701 --> 54:51.236
Be careful.
In the cage, in it!

54:56.001 --> 55:01.460
Well, well, well. And what by Zeus
and all the gods have we got here?

55:01.632 --> 55:04.123
- And who?
- Zenobia.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.634
I thought as much.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.889
- But how?
- Never mind how.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.728
Be careful.

55:15.437 --> 55:18.557
Remember she's a witch,
and dangerous.

55:18.732 --> 55:24.071
Put me down! Let me go!
Don't hold me!

55:24.238 --> 55:27.523
Don't hold me!
How dare you!

55:27.699 --> 55:32.196
Captain... the glass jar
there on the shelf.

55:33.247 --> 55:37.541
It's like trying to hold on to
a scorpion. Dione, clear the table.

55:37.709 --> 55:41.790
Captain, put the jar down over there.
Make a space.

55:43.132 --> 55:47.295
- No wonder Kassim was so violent.
- You should have left her to him.

55:47.469 --> 55:51.467
No, Princess, no.
I want to interrogate her.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.511
I suggest that
whatever power she has used -

55:54.685 --> 55:57.639
- to transport herself here
and change her size -

55:57.813 --> 56:02.060
- is similar in power and property
to that which transformed Kassim.

56:02.234 --> 56:04.903
But what is it and where is it?

56:05.070 --> 56:08.320
Leave her in my charge.
I will try to extract it from her.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.317
You must take every care.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.410
A confrontation with evil
could be dangerous.

56:13.579 --> 56:17.363
Captain, take the princess and Dione
up on deck.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.032
Come with me.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.872
Now then, mistress...

56:27.509 --> 56:30.795
What powers have you used
to shrink yourself?

56:30.971 --> 56:34.803
- I will never tell you.
- Oh dear.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.348
I despise brutality, -

56:38.520 --> 56:43.763
- but at this present moment
I'm prepared to reject compassion.

56:43.942 --> 56:47.607
The sting of this insect
can be fatal to the strongest, -

56:47.780 --> 56:50.105
- but to someone of your size...

56:50.282 --> 56:53.366
Then answer my questions and quickly!

56:53.535 --> 56:57.070
What are you searching for
here on this ship?

57:00.083 --> 57:02.160
These perhaps?

57:11.845 --> 57:13.514
Or this?

57:17.392 --> 57:21.224
How could you know of their existence?

57:54.429 --> 57:59.257
When will you decide to return
to your proper shape and size? And how?

57:59.434 --> 58:01.474
Something of unique power.

58:01.645 --> 58:05.892
The power that might be used to return
Prince Kassim to his human form -

58:06.066 --> 58:09.565
- and make our journey
to the Arimaspi unnecessary.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.610
The Arimaspi!

58:14.366 --> 58:19.906
Where is it? And in what form?
A liquid? A powder?

58:20.080 --> 58:23.829
My locket! ...Gone!

58:24.710 --> 58:28.624
You've dropped it, haven't you?
Now, where would it be?

58:29.465 --> 58:33.083
Kassim... have you seen it?

58:42.686 --> 58:44.394
Here it is.

58:44.563 --> 58:49.059
It's mine, it's mine.
It belongs to me!

58:57.618 --> 59:02.030
It's smashed, the liquid's evaporating.
There's not much left.

59:03.540 --> 59:07.408
- Take care, the liquid is precious.
- Evidently.

59:07.586 --> 59:12.165
I believe it is the very stuff you used
to transform Kassim into an animal.

59:12.341 --> 59:16.385
Perhaps there's not enough left
to retransform him. I must test it.

59:16.553 --> 59:21.679
- Yes, on our friend here.
- No, that's mine! I need it!

59:25.521 --> 59:28.272
Will he be tempted?

59:28.440 --> 59:31.726
There's a good fellow.
Lap it up, that's the way.

59:31.902 --> 59:35.353
No, no, there's not enough!

59:35.531 --> 59:37.523
Be silent!

59:43.038 --> 59:46.122
By all the gods!

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:20.027
Kill! Kill the Greek!

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.093
Get away from me!

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:09.243
Transformed... the locket!

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.801
Get back!

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.395
- It's a mad bee!
- What is it?

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:36.099
It's not a bee. It's a mosquito!

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.853
What a mosquito!

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.865
The bird is getting away!

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.459
Kill the bird first.
We need the locket.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:14.146
Praise be to Allah that you're unhurt.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.984
Alas,
I underestimated the power of Zenobia.

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:21.859
I fear I've thrown away a chance
for Kassim. I am profoundly sorry.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:27.191
You were right, Princess.
We should have left her to Kassim.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.658
Try to calm him, Dione.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:35.619
He's becoming more savage. Best to
keep him locked in his cage from now on.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.200
Safe... You are safe.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.332
Is there enough?

01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:26.920
Yes, by all the gods of the underworld,
there must be!

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:20.855
Not enough! Not enough!

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:59.644
If only I had seen more.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:03.728
Memorised more,
recorded it into my brain.

01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:09.611
- A valley.
- At the end of the world.

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:14.490
And here: The shrine of the legends.
The healing shrine.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.615
We must let Sinbad show us the way.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:23.080
And then I shall find the means
to prevent Melanthius from interfering.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.335
Come, help me.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.057
Ahoy!

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.017
Ice! Ice ahead!

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:27.190
- Where away?
- Dead ahead. Icebergs!

01:06:35.617 --> 01:06:37.286
At last!

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.624
- Will it be soon now?
- We must sail north for four more days.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:48.869
The less distance to cover on foot
the better. Anything to gain time.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:51.918
The fourth full moon.

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:21.787
Two degrees port!

01:07:39.014 --> 01:07:40.639
Look at them.

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:45.719
One column of that on top of us
and we'd sink like a ship of lead.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.505
The entrance to the tunnel
is somewhere there.

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:19.337
If we could enter safely,
our journey will be all but over.

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:24.590
Sinbad, there!
Exactly as described in the scrolls.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.435
Hassan, fetch me the chart.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:34.770
- The tunnel leads directly to the shrine.
- It'll crack the boat like a walnut!

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.649
We must take the longer route.

01:08:37.823 --> 01:08:43.410
There's less than three moons left.
If only we could've entered the tunnel.

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:56.169
We'll never make headway against this.
It's getting thicker every hour.

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:03.131
The hull must split if we go further.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.349
Maroof... load up the sledge.

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:16.059
Throw up the ropes...
Quickly!

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:39.956
Keep moving, don't stop!
Pull! Keep pulling.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:44.511
- It's easier to abandon it!
- Keep moving.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.735
The ice is no match
for a boat of bronze.

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:06.945
- And Sinbad?
- Perhaps smashed, drowned or frozen.

01:10:47.703 --> 01:10:51.487
Bahadin!...
What could it be?

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:02.342
What is it?

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:10.175
Look, it's beginning to crack!

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.234
I'll get the others!

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:29.574
On your feet! Seize anything you can!
Spears, axes, anything!

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:32.662
Melanthius,
protect Dione and the princess!

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:37.292
A giant walrus! We must stop it
before it reaches the camp!

01:11:58.649 --> 01:12:01.056
Hit the eye! The eye!

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.882
Attack!

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:30.587
Get the cargo net.

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:33.433
Careful, Maroof!

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.814
Protect the supplies!

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:52.241
Get the cargo net!

01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:05.246
Unravel it. This way. Quickly!

01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:08.802
Open it. Spread it out.

01:13:14.308 --> 01:13:17.178
Push, go on, push!

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:27.186
He's pulling us!
Pull away from him.

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:41.413
He's pulling us!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.769
Help me.

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:01.679
Cut me loose.

01:14:03.816 --> 01:14:07.600
Sinbad, my foot!
Cut me loose.

01:14:10.906 --> 01:14:13.148
Hassan, your knife!

01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:17.949
Cut me loose, cut me loose!

01:14:31.135 --> 01:14:34.966
Too bad you couldn't hold him.
I should've liked to examine him.

01:14:35.139 --> 01:14:39.302
- Walrus giganticus, prehistoric!
- I'm sorry. Next time I'll try harder.

01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:40.887
Are you hurt?

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:44.097
It is said a man has only one life.
Now I have two.

01:14:44.273 --> 01:14:46.182
I owe them both to Captain Sinbad.

01:14:46.358 --> 01:14:50.225
I've never seen a black man
turn white before.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:33.233
No sign of a tunnel between the cliffs.

01:15:33.405 --> 01:15:37.070
The chart in the scroll is precise.
There is an entrance -

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:40.777
- and I mean to find it.
Minaton, sail on!

01:16:18.242 --> 01:16:21.527
We've found it! We've found it!

01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:30.544
Look, it's the aurora, see?

01:16:30.712 --> 01:16:33.963
Hyperborea just beyond the hills.

01:16:34.133 --> 01:16:36.670
And that strange glittering light?

01:16:36.844 --> 01:16:40.295
The Arimaspi call it
the gift of the winter Apollo.

01:16:40.472 --> 01:16:44.387
We call it aurora borealis.
And there, directly below the aurora, -

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.514
- the Valley of the Shrine.

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:44.697
He's turning carnivorous.

01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:49.455
I hope it is not too late for Kassim.

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:52.661
He no longer responds
to human speech or contact.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:55.410
Except for Dione.

01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:49.092
Take them, Maroof.
Protect the women.

01:19:07.453 --> 01:19:11.450
Sinbad, stand still!
All of you, don't make any sudden moves.

01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:14.790
He's as frightened of us
as we are of him.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.127
- I'm more frightened.
- I'm twice more frightened.

01:19:18.297 --> 01:19:23.967
Sinbad... lower your sword
and step back slowly.

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:25.387
Do it!

01:19:35.022 --> 01:19:38.142
What sort of evil monster is it?

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:48.986
It's not a monster.
It's one of man's ancestors.

01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:53.490
They're not evil.
They're called troglodytes.

01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:57.117
I've got the skull of one of them
in my laboratory.

01:19:58.253 --> 01:20:00.495
He's coming closer!

01:20:03.175 --> 01:20:06.342
Dione... speak to him.

01:20:08.347 --> 01:20:12.214
Gently...
They have no idea of language, -

01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:17.220
- but these primates were known for
their gentleness with females.

01:20:21.652 --> 01:20:23.691
There, there...

01:20:24.738 --> 01:20:28.356
No harm.
We mean no harm.

01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:38.122
Friends.
We are friends.

01:20:43.298 --> 01:20:45.540
Dione, be careful!

01:21:26.091 --> 01:21:28.250
Kassim, he means no harm.

01:21:38.645 --> 01:21:41.599
Perhaps he might be able to help us.

01:21:41.773 --> 01:21:44.478
Dione, Princess...

01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:51.823
Persuade Kassim to bring the trog
over here. I've something to show him.

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.417
Bring trog.

01:22:04.588 --> 01:22:07.755
Bring him over there.

01:22:07.925 --> 01:22:10.498
There... to my father.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:46.664
Kassim, I want the troglodyte
to look at this.

01:22:46.839 --> 01:22:48.962
The face drawn on the scrolls!

01:22:49.133 --> 01:22:52.751
It marks the entrance to the valley,
the gate to the shrine.

01:23:07.651 --> 01:23:09.644
Where, where?

01:23:11.655 --> 01:23:15.320
Hyperborea!
By all the gods, he's done it!

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:28.035
Hassan, Maroof, the weapons.

01:23:50.736 --> 01:23:52.563
There! There it is!

01:23:56.283 --> 01:24:02.156
The entrance to the tunnel of ice!
The way to Hyperborea.

01:24:05.042 --> 01:24:09.502
We shall be there first!
The tunnel, Minaton.

01:24:39.243 --> 01:24:41.698
I will light the torches.

01:25:30.335 --> 01:25:33.040
- Farah, are you all right?
- Yes.

01:25:48.896 --> 01:25:51.517
There! Look over there!

01:26:17.549 --> 01:26:21.879
- The last of the Arimaspi?
- Who can say?

01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:40.239
Minaton.

01:26:44.118 --> 01:26:45.577
Listen!

01:26:50.666 --> 01:26:53.501
The boat is still moving!

01:26:55.003 --> 01:26:59.665
There's some extraordinary force
pulling us like a mighty magnet, -

01:26:59.842 --> 01:27:02.593
- drawing us to the shrine.

01:27:24.074 --> 01:27:26.612
The face from the scrolls...

01:27:28.036 --> 01:27:32.034
The gate to the shrine.
Come on.

01:28:04.615 --> 01:28:07.699
Trog seems frightened of the gate.

01:28:09.787 --> 01:28:13.831
- Frightened of what lies beyond, maybe.
- Why should he be afraid?

01:28:13.999 --> 01:28:17.083
Like all primitives,
he's afraid of the unknown.

01:28:17.252 --> 01:28:20.668
Afraid of what he can't understand.

01:29:09.429 --> 01:29:11.718
Help me move the bar.

01:29:15.561 --> 01:29:19.393
It's no use. We cannot move it
without blocks and ropes.

01:29:22.276 --> 01:29:25.230
Trog will help us.
He must help.

01:30:27.049 --> 01:30:29.919
The shrine of the four elements.

01:30:31.845 --> 01:30:38.014
- See, it exists! A reality.
- Hope for Kassim... at last.

01:30:47.069 --> 01:30:48.946
The arch!

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:08.418
The boat is stopping.

01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:10.152
Wait.

01:32:13.363 --> 01:32:16.732
Go on, up into the sunlight.

01:32:39.765 --> 01:32:42.054
There it is.

01:32:44.478 --> 01:32:45.521
Come!

01:33:16.009 --> 01:33:20.137
At last you'll have a use for
that precious key of yours, -

01:33:20.305 --> 01:33:22.381
- if you can find a lock to fit it.

01:33:22.558 --> 01:33:26.176
We'll find it.
The scrolls haven't been wrong yet.

01:33:27.354 --> 01:33:31.767
We must look for an opening
somewhere there among the rocks.

01:33:52.004 --> 01:33:54.709
We must be close.

01:34:12.983 --> 01:34:15.141
Hurry, Rafi!

01:34:15.319 --> 01:34:18.403
Nothing... nothing.

01:34:19.865 --> 01:34:22.985
I could not find an entrance.

01:34:26.914 --> 01:34:30.828
We must make an entrance.
Rafi, Minaton, stay clear!

01:34:35.923 --> 01:34:41.712
Spirits of the underworld,
infuse this potion with your powers!

01:34:49.812 --> 01:34:52.018
What was that?

01:34:52.981 --> 01:34:57.275
- It's like an earthquake.
- There can only be one possible answer.

01:34:57.444 --> 01:34:59.437
The witch.

01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:01.990
Zenobia.

01:35:11.416 --> 01:35:15.248
- He'll never break through.
- He must! He must!

01:35:27.683 --> 01:35:31.811
He must!
Minaton, pull!

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.543
He's done it!

01:36:03.635 --> 01:36:06.720
He's done his work.

01:36:40.506 --> 01:36:42.498
The wall is breached!

01:36:49.556 --> 01:36:52.723
- Look there!
- Zenobia's creation.

01:36:52.893 --> 01:36:56.938
A bull's head, but a...
...giant's body!

01:36:57.105 --> 01:36:58.897
Almighty God, defend us.

01:36:59.066 --> 01:37:03.526
They shouldn't have forced an opening.
The power of the shrine is threatened!

01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:07.907
The atmosphere inside is destroyed!
This key is useless!

01:37:10.953 --> 01:37:14.452
Perhaps there's still time,
but we must be swift!

01:37:39.982 --> 01:37:43.766
Drawn down
from the crown of Apollo itself.

01:38:40.042 --> 01:38:42.877
The guardian of the shrine...

01:38:55.724 --> 01:38:58.013
The ice is melting.

01:38:58.185 --> 01:39:00.062
Look out!

01:39:04.983 --> 01:39:10.144
- We must act at once!
- The cage... and the chains!

01:39:11.156 --> 01:39:13.991
Just as described in the scrolls.

01:39:15.619 --> 01:39:20.744
We must put Kassim in the cage and
pass him through the column of light.

01:39:22.543 --> 01:39:26.208
Sinbad, the chains!
See if they still operate.

01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:20.677
- Thank all the gods.
- The gods have abandoned you!

01:40:21.727 --> 01:40:23.850
Too late, Sinbad!

01:40:25.856 --> 01:40:28.429
Kassim will never be caliph!

01:40:32.029 --> 01:40:35.113
Now, Rafi, now!

01:40:39.411 --> 01:40:44.287
Not the animal, kill Melanthius!
They are helpless without him.

01:42:13.255 --> 01:42:15.331
Sinbad, bring Kassim.

01:42:15.507 --> 01:42:18.959
May the gods of the Arimaspi
grant us the time!

01:43:11.104 --> 01:43:13.726
Bring him up, bring him up!

01:43:50.978 --> 01:43:57.182
O great Apollo! All you gods and forces
that work for good against evil, -

01:43:57.359 --> 01:44:03.113
- help us now! O great mystery,
come to our mortal aid!

01:44:03.282 --> 01:44:05.689
Reveal your secret!

01:44:24.136 --> 01:44:26.757
Lower the cage!

01:45:11.225 --> 01:45:13.513
Your Highness.

01:45:16.396 --> 01:45:21.355
Prince Kassim...
This way, Your Highness.

01:45:50.889 --> 01:45:53.843
Master Melanthius,
he made it all possible.

01:45:54.017 --> 01:45:58.062
- How shall I ever thank you?
- It's an old debt repaid.

01:46:08.115 --> 01:46:13.073
The power of the shrine is failing! We
must go! There's not a moment to lose.

01:46:13.245 --> 01:46:18.156
The temperature's changing violently.
Be swift or this'll become our tomb!

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:21.003
Zenobia!

01:46:21.837 --> 01:46:23.794
She's gone!

01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:45.934
Stand back! Get back!

01:48:18.996 --> 01:48:21.783
- Come on, let's go!
- No, not yet.

01:48:46.607 --> 01:48:48.979
Now, move! Move!

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:53.030
Take Dione and the princess
back to the gate.

01:48:53.197 --> 01:48:55.818
- We shall not leave you!
- Do as I say!

01:48:55.991 --> 01:48:59.526
If I do not join you within an hour,
then head for Charak -

01:48:59.703 --> 01:49:02.657
- before the seventh moon is full.

01:50:46.977 --> 01:50:49.100
Maroof is dead.

01:51:22.888 --> 01:51:24.762
They're coming!

01:51:33.023 --> 01:51:35.265
Where's Maroof?

01:51:39.113 --> 01:51:42.197
Come on, we must not waste a moment.
