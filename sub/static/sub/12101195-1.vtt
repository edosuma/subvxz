00:15.807 --> 00:18.852
(mellow piano music)

00:32.991 --> 00:35.744
(thunder storms)

01:46.106 --> 01:47.440
- Detective Keating.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.359
You know me, we've been here before.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.820
I did not murder this woman.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.781
And after 14 hours of
grilling me on Christmas Eve,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.533
what more could you possibly learn?

01:57.367 --> 01:59.077
- And you think blowing smoke
up my ass for another 14 hours

01:59.077 --> 02:01.079
is gonna get me off my game?

02:01.079 --> 02:04.290
- One must have a game
before one can be thrown off.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.545
- I know you killed Mrs. Egosia.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.173
- I didn't.
- Tell me where the body is

02:12.173 --> 02:14.175
and I might be able to
get you second degree.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.678
- Exactly why would I
entertain that scenario

02:16.678 --> 02:19.430
even if I was guilty,
which of course I'm not?

02:19.430 --> 02:22.392
Every single one of you has come at me.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.477
Duke, Diane, now you.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.355
And what has come of that?

02:27.355 --> 02:28.898
Nothing, zero, zippo.

02:29.774 --> 02:34.779
- Ashley Smith, Tara Webb, Susan Fedyk

02:35.947 --> 02:39.742
Carrie Fox and now Mary Egosia.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.913
The only thing they all
had in common was you.

02:45.498 --> 02:50.503
All had flat tires, all serviced by you.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.925
You're not fooling anyone.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.343
We know you killed them all.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.347
But why don't you do yourself a favor?

03:01.347 --> 03:04.392
Admit it so we can all get out of here.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.398
- You are good.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.734
You almost had me believing
I murdered those women.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.531
- So we're just gonna keep sitting here.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.908
- Sure.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.409
I got no place to be.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.661
- Well then why don't
you ask for a lawyer,

03:23.661 --> 03:24.662
so I can get out of here?

03:24.662 --> 03:25.788
I got presents to wrap.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.334
- I'm enjoying myself.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.668
I'm sorry you're not.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.881
Besides, second degree is for losers.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.637
- I want a coffee.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.430
You want one?

03:46.142 --> 03:46.976
- Sure.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.607
- What do you want?

03:52.607 --> 03:53.566
- I need your help.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.235
- Sure if it gets me off
his desk for a little bit,

03:55.235 --> 03:56.110
what you need?

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
- Sorry about the coffee,

04:04.786 --> 04:06.871
but you're not gonna be here
long enough to drink it.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.292
You know what, you're good.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.337
It turns out that you
didn't kill those women.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.713
- Damn right, I didn't.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.300
- We have the real killer
in custody downstairs.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.261
You're a free man.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.932
Is this it?
- That's it.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.517
Signed, sealed and delivered.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.434
If you need anything
else, I'll be downstairs.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.186
Detective, Chief and I will
be holding a press conference.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.562
- Okay?
- What's his name?

04:32.563 --> 04:34.899
- Congratulations, you are free to go.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.859
- You tell me his goddamn name now.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.449
- His name is Derek Hall

04:44.325 --> 04:47.161
and he worked at the same road
service company that you did.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.080
- That is such bullshit.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.081
- Not sure what you mean,

04:50.081 --> 04:52.709
but you are free to go back
to your life of obscurity

04:52.709 --> 04:53.918
and in about 20 minutes,

04:53.918 --> 04:57.338
Derek Hall's name will be world famous.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.632
- No, no, no, no.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.134
That should be my name.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.846
Whoever you've got down
there is a goddamn liar

05:04.846 --> 05:09.058
and if anybody's gonna be famous, it's me.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.645
He didn't kill anybody, I did.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.773
- And after 18 hours, why am
I supposed to believe you?

05:15.773 --> 05:18.609
- Well, because if you
went to my mountain cabin,

05:18.609 --> 05:20.445
you didn't know about that, did you?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.405
And checked in the basement,

05:22.405 --> 05:25.241
you would find every
single one of the bodies

05:25.241 --> 05:27.744
buried under the floor, you dumbass.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.204
- The mountain cabin outside Idlewild.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.125
- Yeah, we never had enough evidence

05:34.125 --> 05:35.251
to get a search warrant.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.920
But now, now I think we do.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.885
- We got him.
- Yeah.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.179
Damn right we did.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.319
- Detective, you have a
call holding on line four.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.153
- Thanks.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.705
(mellow music)

06:24.509 --> 06:27.261
(sirens wailing)

06:40.608 --> 06:42.568
- [Operator] All available
units in the area

06:42.568 --> 06:45.905
proceed to 122 Ryder Court.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.615
Neighbor has discovered a dead body

06:47.615 --> 06:49.075
outside the back of the house.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.744
Detectives and ambulance already in route.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.747
- Unit 42, code 3 on route.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.626
- I was just out recently on a domestic,

06:58.626 --> 07:00.211
unit 71 code three in route.

07:02.463 --> 07:06.008
(camera shutters clicking)

07:13.641 --> 07:14.517
- [Woman] I could kill you.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.478
- Do it then.
- Liar.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.938
- [John] I'm obviously
not getting laid tonight

07:18.938 --> 07:21.524
so could all of you please just leave.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.859
- [Woman] Don't you want
to claw his eyes out?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.026
- No. No!

07:24.026 --> 07:26.446
- [Woman] He's cheated on all of us.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.156
- [John] Enough, just get out, all of you.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.115
- [Woman] And what if we don't?

07:29.115 --> 07:30.408
- Then I'll kill you.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.201
- [Operator] 911.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.495
- I would like to report
a domestic disturbance.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.378
- This is not good, Diane.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.629
Have you seen the latest polls?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.256
Antonette is within three points.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.382
- Yes, I saw them

07:46.382 --> 07:47.842
and trust me when I tell you,

07:47.842 --> 07:49.886
we have our best detectives on it.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.387
- Not to mention that the victim's mother

07:51.387 --> 07:54.140
is all over the news,
screaming for justice.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.558
- Everyday that goes by,

07:55.558 --> 07:57.226
means less and less of a chance

07:57.226 --> 08:00.104
they'll find those monsters
that killed my son.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.148
John was such a good boy.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.526
This never should have happened.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.945
I'm just praying for justice.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.072
- Yes, I'm aware.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.743
- So what are we doing about it?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.870
- I said, I'm working on it.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.539
- So what are we doing about it?

08:18.539 --> 08:20.458
John Davis was murdered.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.836
There are a lot of donors
in Grenier Park, Diane.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.004
Do I need to elaborate?

08:25.838 --> 08:28.257
It's time for you to go
and gets Scott Keating.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.259
- It's not possible.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.886
- Don't tell me it's not possible.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.348
Scott got a serial killer to
confess after only 18 hours,

08:35.348 --> 08:37.558
something you guys weren't
able to do for years.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.852
- Do I need to remind you
that Detective Keating

08:39.852 --> 08:41.103
has not been back to work

08:41.103 --> 08:43.314
since the night he broke Clifford Daisley.

08:46.025 --> 08:46.859
- How's he doing?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.195
- To be honest, I'm not sure.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.405
- Well, maybe it's time we found out.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.407
If you ask me, Diane it's been too long.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.160
Keating isn't depressed anymore.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.121
He's just, I don't know, in a funk.

08:59.121 --> 08:59.956
(laughing)

08:59.956 --> 09:00.790
- You're a doctor now.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.791
- A talent like his

09:01.791 --> 09:04.043
has been on the sideline long enough.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.297
- Duke Brown is here.
- Send him in.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.468
- This is first degree murder, Diane.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.220
It's not a traffic violation.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.806
Want to shake up the tree?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.976
Get Scott Keating.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.645
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have a luncheon to attend.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.897
- Of course.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.650
- Detective.
- Mr. Mayor

09:33.406 --> 09:34.240
- Have a seat.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.160
- Guess the Mayor's not in a good mood.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.537
- Is he ever?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.331
- I think the night he won his election

09:42.331 --> 09:44.000
is the last time I saw him happy.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.960
- I got to tell you, dude,

09:45.960 --> 09:49.297
nothing frustrates me
more than cases like this.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.590
- Frustrates you, huh?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.091
- It's been a week since the questioning.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.217
Is there anything new?

09:54.385 --> 09:55.386
- Unfortunately, no.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.846
- Well then unfortunately,

09:56.846 --> 09:58.889
politics is getting in the way.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.769
Mayor wants me to bring in Scott Keating.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.897
- That's a mistake.

10:06.897 --> 10:11.110
- Maybe, but it's my
call and I'm doing it.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.903
- And who knows if he
even wants to come back?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.948
- True but he is the best interrogator

10:15.948 --> 10:17.283
that this office has ever had

10:17.283 --> 10:19.785
and this might be the
case to bring him back.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.329
- Really?
- Yes.

10:22.872 --> 10:23.706
- Maybe so.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.001
- Look, if you don't want
to be a part of this,

10:27.001 --> 10:28.669
there's the door.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.631
My back is up against it, my friend.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.091
So either you're with me or you're not.

10:36.010 --> 10:36.844
- Come on, Diane.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.678
You don't have to go there.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.846
You know, I'm always with you.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.098
- Good, then get me the files

10:41.098 --> 10:42.642
on all three by the end of the day,

10:42.642 --> 10:45.186
because I have a house call
to make in the morning.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.782
(mellow music)

11:04.288 --> 11:05.581
- Not answering the door?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
Not picking up your cell?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.253
- It's been on silent.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.340
- How you been?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.966
It's been awhile.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.176
- What can I do for you, Diane?

11:18.427 --> 11:20.221
- Been watching the news at all?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.224
- No cable, no internet.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.895
- Three women are suspects in a murder,

11:27.895 --> 11:30.648
victim found in the home stabbed 17 times.

11:31.982 --> 11:32.817
- Why the three?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.697
- They found out they were all
dating him at the same time.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.033
Idiot drunk texted them for sex

11:41.033 --> 11:43.661
and when they showed up,
because all hell broke loose,

11:43.661 --> 11:44.954
cops were called.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.748
Two weeks later, guy ends up dead.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.043
- Think one of them did it?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.713
- Right now, that's all that makes sense.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.966
- What do you want from me, Diane?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.931
- The mayor's asking
you to help us on this.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.266
I'm asking you to.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.645
And in this file is
everything you need to know

12:09.645 --> 12:10.730
to bring you up to speed.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.775
- I see why the three
would be mad as hell,

12:14.775 --> 12:19.321
but murder just for
cheating, it's kind of thin.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.656
- Duke Brown's convinced.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.326
- You got Duke Brown on the case?

12:25.786 --> 12:27.997
Yeah, he's a good detective.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.916
How long did he interrogate
them before you released them?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.210
- How do you know we let them go?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.336
- Come on, Diane.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.922
You wouldn't be here if
they were still in custody.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.966
- Nine and a half hours.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.009
We saw that they'd had enough

12:40.009 --> 12:43.888
so we turned them loose
before they lawyered up.

12:44.972 --> 12:45.806
- Evidence?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.225
- Crime scene was pretty clean

12:48.225 --> 12:51.979
besides blood and a ball of tape.

12:51.979 --> 12:56.692
- Yeah, well jealousy and anger
can be a deadly combination.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.986
- You got that right.
- Yeah.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.030
Victim have a name?
- Yes.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.117
John Davis.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.631
- It's been 540 days since
Molly and Jessica left me.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.092
Molly kept complaining
that I worked too hard.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.220
I can't help but thinking

13:24.220 --> 13:25.846
that if I was home on that Christmas Eve,

13:25.846 --> 13:28.808
instead of interrogating,
Clifford Daisley for 18 hours,

13:29.934 --> 13:31.268
things might've been different.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.066
But we got a serial killer off the street,

13:37.066 --> 13:39.235
so that's something.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.242
- Yeah.

13:46.242 --> 13:51.247
Just so you know, Scott, it's
more than just something.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.042
It's way more than that.

13:58.462 --> 14:02.508
- Well, just leave the
file on your way out.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.509
I'll take a look.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.976
- Listen, if I didn't say so earlier,

14:11.976 --> 14:14.228
it's good to see you again.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.883
- Good morning, Alice.
- Good morning.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.134
- Messages?
- Yes.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.136
The banners and posters
are ready to be picked up

15:29.136 --> 15:30.971
at ABC Imaging.
- Oh, excellent.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.431
- The contracts came.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.807
- Great.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.351
And you have a potential new client.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.645
I already put them in your office.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.562
- A walk in.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.772
Yeah, his name is Greg Fuller.

15:43.651 --> 15:48.656
- First suspect, Karen Jones,
45 divorced, no children.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.409
She's the owner of a
small advertising company.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.704
Karen and John had been
seeing each other the longest.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.332
She's tough and extremely smart.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.501
He pushed for them to get married,

16:00.501 --> 16:02.002
but she wouldn't marry someone

16:02.002 --> 16:04.630
who makes less money than her.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.341
However, I'm sure it
didn't sit well with Karen

16:07.341 --> 16:10.094
when she found out he was
cheating with multiple women.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.931
- Good morning, Mr. Fuller.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.600
- Call me Greg.
- Karen Jones.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.518
What can I do for you today?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.645
- Well, my brother and I
are opening up a restaurant

16:19.645 --> 16:21.355
in the Valley and we're
thinking about advertising

16:21.355 --> 16:23.524
on social media, radio,
that type of thing,

16:23.524 --> 16:25.734
and we hear that's something that you do.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.277
- Social media is my specialty.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.489
- Great, that's great.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.616
- What kind of restaurant?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.660
- Well, we haven't decided yet.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.705
But wait, Karen Jones.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.416
You were the girlfriend of
the guy that got killed.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.001
I read about it.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.503
I'm sorry about that.
- Thank you.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.506
I'd broken up with him two months prior.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.216
I had to read about it too.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.926
- How'd you feel when you found out?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.640
- Are we here to talk about my love life

16:56.640 --> 16:59.351
or your ad campaign?
- I'm sorry.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.186
I can't do anything without
running it past my brother,

17:01.186 --> 17:03.272
but I always like to get a read

17:03.272 --> 17:05.274
on someone I might be working with.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.275
- Absolutely.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.778
- And I have a feeling that
you'll be seeing me again soon.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.988
- Looking forward to it.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.615
- It was a pleasure.
- All mine.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.746
Exciting.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.706
I'm looking forward to
handling your advertising.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.958
- The one thing I know,
we get the best effort

17:22.958 --> 17:25.627
from those that are
professional in their field.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.089
That doesn't mean that
there's an unlimited budget.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.507
- Absolutely.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.551
As we discussed, it's
all in your contract.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.385
- Great.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.096
- Remember me?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.222
Why'd you do it?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.348
- John, I'm in a meeting.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.017
- Why don't you stop payment
on the check you wrote me?

17:40.017 --> 17:41.226
I needed that money.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.854
- I can come back.
- No, no.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.106
- Good idea.
- Please, he's leaving.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.357
- I have all the information I need,

17:47.357 --> 17:49.735
I'll get back to my board
and I'll get back to you.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.944
- I am so sorry.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.362
I look forward to handling your account.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.363
- Yeah, yeah, later.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.117
- Are you that stupid.
- What?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.704
- You just lost me a six-figure deal.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.415
So I'll ask again, are you that stupid?

18:03.415 --> 18:06.085
- Why did you cancel
the payment you sent me?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.587
I told you I was gonna pay you
back on my deal went through.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.297
Now, I don't even have a deal.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.131
- After I wrote that check,

18:11.131 --> 18:13.217
I received a call from
my credit card company.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.844
It seems that someone
tried to withdraw $2,000

18:15.844 --> 18:17.471
from a casino ATM.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.807
Any idea who could have
stolen my credit card?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.766
- Are you accusing me of stealing?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.142
- I don't give a shit anymore, John.

18:22.142 --> 18:25.479
All I know is this, the bank
of Karen is closed for good.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.982
- You're gonna regret you did this to me.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.234
- Get out of my office.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.541
- [Announcer] Anderson party,
court nine is now available.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.841
- Thank you, I'll see you next week.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.268
- Sarah Dobson,
professional ballet dancer.

19:04.268 --> 19:08.105
33, never married, no children.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.606
Sarah is part of a touring group

19:09.606 --> 19:12.609
performing the Nutcracker
Suite all over the world.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.611
John met Sarah about a year ago

19:14.611 --> 19:16.446
after a performance in Los Angeles.

19:16.446 --> 19:20.033
Sarah was the last one to see John alive

19:20.033 --> 19:24.329
and her movie alibi the night
he was killed is a bit shaky.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.875
- A couple nice shots.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.335
- Thanks, did you see that
last one was terrible.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.337
- So you're relaxing or working?

19:32.337 --> 19:33.922
- No, relaxing actually.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.090
The owner who's right there.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.051
He's a nice enough to
let me come here and play

19:38.051 --> 19:39.720
when I'm not on tour, so.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.554
- On tour?

19:40.554 --> 19:41.638
- Yeah, sorry.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.057
I'm a professional ballet dancer.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.268
- Oh, well that explains the gracefulness.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.644
- Oh, that's nice.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.439
Thank you.
- I'm Eddie Carmen.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.316
- Hi, I'm Sarah Dobson.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.109
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.652
- Wait a second, Sarah Dobson,

19:57.154 --> 19:58.655
the girlfriend of the guy who got killed.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.948
I read about in the paper.

19:59.948 --> 20:00.991
Must have been crazy.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.872
- Yeah, if you'll excuse me, I gotta...

20:06.872 --> 20:07.915
- I'm sorry.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.708
I didn't mean to offend you.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.085
You know, sometimes my
curiosity gets the best of me.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.046
- No, it's okay really.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.882
- You really must have cared about him.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.386
- Sorry.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.430
It was really nice meeting you.

20:23.430 --> 20:27.100
- Actually, I'm reporter
for a very popular blog.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.686
If you ever want to get
your side of the story out,

20:29.686 --> 20:30.854
look me up.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.272
- I appreciate that, thank you.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.358
- No worries.
- Take care of yourself.

20:44.701 --> 20:49.248
♪ Lord knows I wrestle with my demons. ♪

20:59.258 --> 21:02.177
- Here you go Charlie.
- Thank you Cass.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.473
- What can I get you?

21:07.891 --> 21:12.479
And finally there is Cassandra King, 46,

21:12.479 --> 21:14.815
single mother of one son, Jared King

21:14.815 --> 21:17.025
who's serving in Afghanistan.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.944
Cassandra's husband, Paul was killed

21:18.944 --> 21:22.239
trying to exit the North
tower during the 9/11 attack.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.325
Jared was only three at the time

21:25.325 --> 21:26.410
and Cassandra moved to California

21:26.410 --> 21:29.246
and she now owns a dive bar in the Valley

21:29.246 --> 21:30.998
and John and her met at the bar

21:30.998 --> 21:33.375
and have been on and off
for the last two years.

21:36.503 --> 21:41.466
- Yeah coffee.
- Yeah, just made a fresh pot.

21:41.591 --> 21:42.884
Cream, and sugar?

21:42.884 --> 21:45.887
- No, I'll just take a straight.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.476
- Here you go, uh...
- Eddie.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.653
- What?

22:01.653 --> 22:02.863
You know that schmuck?

22:02.863 --> 22:04.781
- No, I just think it's kind of odd

22:04.781 --> 22:06.700
to have an article like that framed.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.911
- It's my claim to fame.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.831
I used to date that lying,
cheating, stealing SOB.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.875
- Oh yeah.
- Mh.

22:16.668 --> 22:20.422
- Do you mind if I-
- Read all about it?

22:26.386 --> 22:27.596
- You're Cassandra King.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.723
I've read this article.

22:29.723 --> 22:33.226
The police suspected you of murder.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.770
- Yeah, but I didn't do it.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.896
- So they cleared you.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.314
That's pretty good, huh?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.982
- Well, I don't know about all that.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.901
I just told him Sarah probably did it.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.862
The look on her face the
night we caught him, hoof.

22:46.281 --> 22:49.117
- "The victim John Davis was
caught by Cassandra King,

22:49.951 --> 22:53.413
Sarah Dobson and Karen
Jones all at the same time."

22:54.873 --> 22:55.832
- Yeah, it was a hell of a night.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.085
(laughing)

22:59.711 --> 23:00.545
Idiot, he was drunk.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.297
He texted me telling me he missed me.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.256
Come on by my house.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.760
I get there, his other two
girlfriends are already there.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.262
Fool sent us all the same text.

23:09.262 --> 23:10.764
- I'm sure that went over well.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.766
- Like a lead balloon, baby.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.189
Sarah just cried. Karen
wanted to kill him.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.690
So did I.

23:20.690 --> 23:21.733
We probably would have,

23:21.733 --> 23:23.902
but I guess some neighbor
must have heard the commotion

23:23.902 --> 23:25.112
and called the cops.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.655
Next thing we know the cops show up,

23:26.655 --> 23:28.115
they tell us we have a choice.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.450
Either leave or spend the night in jail.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.285
So we all split.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.871
A couple of weeks later, he winds up dead.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.749
- Wait a second, you
said that you and Karen

23:37.749 --> 23:38.583
wanted him dead, but
Sarah was just crying.

23:40.877 --> 23:41.753
- Yeah

23:41.753 --> 23:43.380
- But then, didn't you just say

23:43.380 --> 23:45.132
that Sarah also wanted to kill him?

23:46.425 --> 23:47.843
- Look, I don't really know

23:47.843 --> 23:51.221
what anyone else did or wanted to do.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.890
I just know that I didn't do it.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.268
See, I've got too much to lose.

23:56.268 --> 24:01.273
I've got my bar, I've got nice
customers like Charlie here.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.610
And most importantly, I've got
my son over in Afghanistan.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.156
He's my everything.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.449
I wouldn't do that to him.

24:12.909 --> 24:16.455
- Thank him for his service.
- I'll do that.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.542
What, no change?

24:20.542 --> 24:21.626
- Buy one for Charlie.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.256
- Hey, thanks guy.
- Big spender.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.342
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

24:31.636 --> 24:34.514
- I'm in.
- You read the files?

24:34.514 --> 24:37.058
- Not only that, I went and
met with every one of them.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.227
- Wow, have a seat.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.689
You know, I want you on this,

24:42.689 --> 24:44.691
but I am under a lot of
pressure from the mayor.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.652
I don't need you losing it
and downing a pint of scotch.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.614
- Yeah, that's a fair concern.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.740
But I thought you said it was the mayor

24:51.740 --> 24:53.450
that asked you to bring me in on this.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.577
- Not if you fail, then it's my call.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.288
- Understood.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.666
Look Diane, I'm done drinking.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.918
I mean, I drank enough
in the last two years

25:02.918 --> 25:03.960
to last me a lifetime.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.214
So trust me, everything
will be by the book.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.759
- There will be ground rules.

25:10.759 --> 25:14.262
You will consult with Duke
on all interrogations.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.349
He will listen in and watch
from behind the glass.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.767
- Done, what else?

25:18.767 --> 25:21.520
- I expect to be kept in the
loop on all developments.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.104
I don't have to remind you

25:23.104 --> 25:25.607
that there are circumstances
to these interrogations.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.443
And if I feel even for a second,

25:28.443 --> 25:31.446
that you are taking it
personal, you're gone.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.782
- Diane, you asked me to do a job.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.116
I'll do the job.

25:37.035 --> 25:41.081
- Last thing I will protect the
integrity of this department

25:41.081 --> 25:42.374
at all costs.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.293
- Understood.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.048
So what's the play?
- You tell me.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.009
- Bring them in.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.515
- This afternoon, the Los
Angeles police department

25:58.515 --> 26:00.433
brought back in the three women

26:00.433 --> 26:04.145
in connection with the
horrific murder of John Davis.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.857
Karen Jones, Cassandra
King and Sarah Dobson,

26:07.857 --> 26:10.485
all former girlfriends of Mr. Davis

26:10.485 --> 26:13.029
are being accused of
either conspiring together

26:13.029 --> 26:14.573
or acting alone.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.200
All three women have
maintained their innocence.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.161
John's mother, Francine
Davis was standing by

26:20.161 --> 26:21.997
to talk about today's developments.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.374
- This is the second time

26:24.374 --> 26:26.710
that these same women have been brought in

26:26.710 --> 26:28.962
and I'm just hoping
it's for something new,

26:28.962 --> 26:30.422
and not just for the cameras.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.305
- You've actually already interviewed.

26:38.305 --> 26:42.225
What do you think?
- Karen's very smart.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.518
I always have the impression

26:43.518 --> 26:44.978
that she's trying to stay

26:44.978 --> 26:47.731
one or two steps ahead
of me in the questioning,

26:47.731 --> 26:50.233
trying to lead me instead
of the other way around.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.986
- Liar?
- Absolutely.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.323
But it's weird, she lies about
stupid, irrelevant stuff.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.825
She said she Hofstra University

26:58.825 --> 27:00.785
yet she went to UC Santa Barbara.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.037
I mean, why would somebody say that

27:02.037 --> 27:04.164
when they know how easy
it is to check out.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.793
- Look, I know you've been on this case

27:08.793 --> 27:11.796
a lot longer than me, so
I welcome your counsel.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.716
- And I know Diane told you

27:14.716 --> 27:16.885
I was gonna be her eyes
and ears on this thing,

27:16.885 --> 27:18.219
but I'm a cop first.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.556
- Copy that.

27:23.933 --> 27:28.438
- So 72 hours.
- I have an idea.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.526
- Game on.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.413
- You know, I knew when
you didn't call back

27:45.413 --> 27:46.748
there were something up.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.542
- Mr. Fuller, right?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.212
More like Mr. Fuller of shit.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.008
- Fuller of shit.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.134
That's funny.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.222
Ms. Jones, my real name is Scott Keating

28:02.222 --> 28:04.224
and I'm a detective with the LAPD.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.558
I was brought in two weeks ago

28:05.558 --> 28:08.436
to help with the murder of John Davis.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.855
- Such a waste of time.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.149
I already answered every question.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.317
Don't worry about them.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.532
- It's like I'm dealing
with a straight shooter.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.533
- Glad you think so.

28:22.742 --> 28:26.746
- Look, I already told you, I
don't even know why I'm here.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.082
I told the police everything,
not sure what's changed.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.877
- But what hasn't changed is
that John Davis is still dead

28:32.877 --> 28:34.295
and one of you killed him.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.508
- Really?
- Yes, really.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.594
Throat slashed, body stabbed 17 times.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.391
But maybe a robbery gone bad.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.143
No, you're too smart to think that.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.729
- Well, it wasn't me.

28:52.939 --> 28:53.773
- Really?

28:58.027 --> 28:59.696
Here's how this is gonna play out.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.822
All right, you have two choices.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.116
One, you help me solve this case

29:03.116 --> 29:05.326
by sitting there
answering all my questions

29:05.326 --> 29:07.078
and waiving your right to an attorney

29:07.078 --> 29:09.831
or two, you ask for an attorney

29:10.790 --> 29:14.502
and then this drags on for
months and convinces not only me,

29:14.502 --> 29:17.046
but the district attorney that
you have something to hide,

29:17.046 --> 29:20.592
something that will rain down
such a wave of focus on you

29:20.592 --> 29:23.511
that if you didn't pay a
parking ticket 10 years ago,

29:24.512 --> 29:25.555
we'd know about it.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.392
- Wow, that was direct.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.520
- You want a straight shooter?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.354
If you're innocent,

29:33.354 --> 29:35.064
I would suggest that you sign this letter

29:35.064 --> 29:37.650
waiving your right to an
attorney for 72 hours.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.278
It's not a legal document,
but if after three days

29:40.278 --> 29:41.821
we haven't charged you with anything,

29:41.821 --> 29:44.532
I don't think we ever will.

29:44.532 --> 29:47.577
But if you're guilty and you
think you can outsmart me,

29:48.620 --> 29:51.289
think the smartest thing
you could do is lawyer up.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.217
- Got a pen?

30:16.773 --> 30:18.024
- I'll be back in five minutes.

30:18.024 --> 30:21.694
You want a water, soda,
coffee, something like that?

30:21.694 --> 30:26.491
- Latte, half-caff.
- Coming up.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.003
- Nice work.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.381
Diane is gonna be happy about this.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.674
- Now the clock is ticking.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.261
- What's in the folder.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.430
- Did you ever meet John's parents?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.308
- No.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.811
I know his father passed
away a couple of years ago.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.020
No, I never met either of them.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.442
- Tell me about your childhood.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.444
- My childhood?

31:03.444 --> 31:05.405
What's that got to do with anything?

31:05.405 --> 31:06.447
- Do you want to get out of here?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.323
- Of course.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.993
- Then stop asking questions
and start answering them.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.912
- What would you like to know?

31:13.830 --> 31:14.664
- Father.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.253
- He left my mother when I
was six, never saw him again.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.380
- Sorry to hear about that.
- Don't be.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.882
Treated her like crap.

31:26.301 --> 31:29.762
- Physically.
- Not that I recall.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.597
The yelling.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.560
He would get drunk and blame
her for all our problems.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.436
Mostly money.

31:37.353 --> 31:41.691
He went out for cigarettes
one night and never came back.

31:41.691 --> 31:45.111
I heard years later, he died of hepatitis.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.656
- How did your mother deal with him

31:48.656 --> 31:49.699
walking out on the two of you?

31:49.699 --> 31:51.200
- My mother was my champion.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.244
She did everything she could for me.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.329
Sacrificed.

31:55.413 --> 31:59.125
- You were married,
but it didn't work out.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.919
Think that had something
to do with your dad?

32:00.919 --> 32:02.378
- That man may have been my father,

32:02.378 --> 32:04.130
but don't ever call him my dad.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.052
I was too young to get married.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.096
I stuck it out for eight freaking years.

32:13.139 --> 32:16.392
Truth is I never worked at it.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.394
I chose to focus on my career instead.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.772
I knew what it was like to grow up poor,

32:20.772 --> 32:24.359
so having to rely on a
man, never gonna happen.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.947
- You still keep in touch with your ex?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.074
- Not even, please.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.202
He was a douche bag just
like my dad - father.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.164
Look, are we gonna talk
about who killed John?

32:38.164 --> 32:40.416
I told the other detectives
it's gotta be Cassandra.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.543
- Yeah, why?
- Come on.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.005
The knife that killed
John was military issued.

32:47.924 --> 32:48.800
I looked it up.

32:49.968 --> 32:50.927
Only person I know

32:50.927 --> 32:53.012
who could get her hands
on a weapon like that

32:53.012 --> 32:55.848
is a mother whose son is a Green Beret.

32:58.184 --> 33:03.189
Okay, if I was gonna kill
John, which I didn't,

33:04.399 --> 33:06.109
I'd just hire a guy.

33:06.943 --> 33:07.902
Less mess.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.701
Anyway, Casandra should be
the one in here, not me.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.288
What are you writing?

33:20.540 --> 33:24.252
- We found Chenille
fibers at the crime scene.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.753
You know anything about that?

33:25.753 --> 33:30.216
- Yeah, it's Chenille and hell
no, I don't wear that crap.

33:32.468 --> 33:37.015
- Guard, please take Ms.
Jones back to her cell

33:37.015 --> 33:38.599
and bring Ms. Dobson.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.727
- Miss Dobson, Sarah Dobson.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.395
What a sweet naive girl.

33:42.395 --> 33:45.690
She loved John and he
treated her like shit.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.692
That girl couldn't hurt
somebody's feelings,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.068
let alone kill a guy.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.195
I'm telling you, it's got to be Cassandra.

33:54.782 --> 33:55.616
- Okay.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.166
You know that file?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.836
That file contains more
information about the three of you

34:06.836 --> 34:08.379
than you know about yourselves.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.506
So when one of my suspects-

34:10.506 --> 34:11.632
- Persons of interest.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.134
- When one of my suspects

34:13.134 --> 34:16.262
who actually grew up in a
middle-class neighborhood,

34:16.262 --> 34:18.765
middle-class family, father
an insurance salesman,

34:18.765 --> 34:22.310
mother, a school teacher,
happily married for 53 years,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.187
you'll excuse me if I'm a bit skeptical

34:24.187 --> 34:27.148
if I'm fed a bunch of
sympathetic bullshit.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.736
- You forget, I dated
a college quarterback.

34:31.736 --> 34:34.322
- UCSB doesn't have a football team.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.115
Something to think about
while you sit in your cell

34:36.115 --> 34:37.200
for a couple hours.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.704
Get her out of here.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.538
- Let's go Jones.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.588
- Are you all right?

34:50.588 --> 34:52.673
You look like you lost your
cool for a second there.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.258
- No, I'm okay.

34:54.258 --> 34:57.011
That's what I wanted her to think.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.014
- Cool, you need anything?

35:03.226 --> 35:04.977
- Let's cut the lights on the next one.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.358
Don't be scared.

35:11.734 --> 35:12.568
Here we go.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.741
Like I said earlier, if you're innocent,

35:18.741 --> 35:20.618
you have nothing to worry about.

35:22.245 --> 35:27.250
- Karen is the one who
killed John, not me.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.836
- Why would you say that?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.003
- I saw the rage.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.424
- You knew John's mother?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.179
- We never met personally,

35:40.179 --> 35:42.849
but we talked on the
phone a couple of times.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.853
here and there

35:46.853 --> 35:49.188
- We need to interview Francine Davis.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.276
- But you never lent
him any money, did you?

35:54.527 --> 35:57.697
- No, he knew I didn't have any money.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.073
I mean, I'm a ballet dancer

35:59.073 --> 36:01.450
and my mom's house is in foreclosure.

36:01.450 --> 36:04.495
So anything that I had, it went to her.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.039
- How'd you meet John?

36:07.039 --> 36:10.334
- Actually, we met the same
way that you and I met,

36:12.128 --> 36:14.797
except he didn't give me a fake name.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.466
- Part of the job.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.055
- He was young for his age, you know?

36:24.932 --> 36:26.017
But I'll tell you one thing.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.312
He had a temper.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.360
He got this package in the mail

36:36.360 --> 36:38.613
and it was filled with dog crap.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.032
(chuckles)

36:41.032 --> 36:43.201
Yeah, dog crap and he lost it.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.995
- Why would someone send them
a package full of dog crap?

36:45.995 --> 36:48.789
- I think he owed somebody money.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.125
- What would make you
come to that conclusion?

36:51.125 --> 36:53.252
- Well, there was a note attached

36:53.252 --> 36:54.587
that said I'm gonna keep giving you shit

36:54.587 --> 36:55.588
until I get my money.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.422
- There it is.

36:57.423 --> 37:00.009
Someone was literally giving him crap.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.138
So you were dating John for about a year

37:04.138 --> 37:06.807
before you found out
he was cheating on you.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.939
- Yeah, I think that's about right, yeah.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.607
- How'd that make you feel?

37:15.566 --> 37:16.692
- How do you think it made me feel?

37:16.692 --> 37:18.819
I mean, I was mad.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.154
- Hurt?
- Of course.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.197
- Angry.
- Yes.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.533
- Angry enough to kill him.
- No, absolutely not.

37:24.533 --> 37:25.368
I loved him.

37:25.368 --> 37:30.331
- Because in your earlier
interviews with the detectives,

37:30.706 --> 37:33.542
Karen and Cassandra said that
you threatened to kill him

37:33.542 --> 37:34.543
right there in the kitchen.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.254
- Karen and Cassandra a lying.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.340
- You know how many times
my mother used to say to me,

37:39.340 --> 37:42.009
if you do that again, I'm gonna kill you?

37:42.009 --> 37:43.552
Hundreds.

37:43.552 --> 37:44.804
Did I really think she was gonna kill me?

37:44.804 --> 37:45.638
Of course not.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.473
She was angry.

37:49.600 --> 37:54.605
So are you sure that
maybe in a fit of rage,

37:56.607 --> 37:58.359
maybe you said something like that?

38:00.152 --> 38:04.699
- And even, if you did say it,
it doesn't make you a killer.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.079
- Maybe.

38:15.001 --> 38:15.793
I was so mad.

38:23.342 --> 38:28.306
But as you said, it doesn't
mean I did it, right?

38:32.852 --> 38:34.478
- State your name for the record.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.897
- Don't think I didn't see you

38:36.897 --> 38:38.649
eyeballing that scotch bottle

38:38.649 --> 38:41.944
before you ordered the
coffee there, Eddie.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.739
Cassandra King.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.241
- Did you murder John Davis?

38:48.617 --> 38:50.244
- No.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.538
Doesn't mean I'm not
dancing a jig on the inside

38:52.538 --> 38:54.623
because somebody else did though.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.042
- Do you know John's parents?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.795
- His dad was dead and he
never talked about his mother.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.547
So, no, I didn't know them.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.300
Do you know what a Birmington knife is?

39:04.300 --> 39:08.179
- I don't know, I'm gonna
guess a knife from Birmington.

39:08.179 --> 39:12.767
A military knife used by
seals and such for combat.

39:14.518 --> 39:18.522
- And your son is currently
serving in Afghanistan.

39:18.522 --> 39:19.482
- He is.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.233
- When was the last time you saw him?

39:22.401 --> 39:26.072
- Last Christmas.
- Did you murder John Davis?

39:26.072 --> 39:27.448
Why don't you ask the ballerina?

39:27.448 --> 39:29.825
- I'm asking you.
- And I already told you, no.

39:36.874 --> 39:37.875
(sighs)

39:37.875 --> 39:38.751
- How's it going?

39:39.877 --> 39:42.505
- Just getting started
with Cassandra King.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.382
- How'd you meet John?

39:44.382 --> 39:46.550
- He was a regular at the bar.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.054
He used to come in on his way
home from work for nightcap.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.347
One night I was closing up

39:51.347 --> 39:53.849
and he stopped in begging for a drink.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.101
Let's just say he was still there

39:55.101 --> 39:56.811
at the bar with me in the morning.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.939
- How long ago was that?
- Two years ago.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.858
- And your previous interviews
with detective Brown,

40:02.858 --> 40:04.902
you said that John owed
you a lot of money.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.904
- 10,000.
- 10,000.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.408
Did you have that kind of money on hand?

40:10.408 --> 40:11.826
- I borrowed against my bar.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.453
I've been to your bar.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.621
It's not a smart idea.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.542
I loved him and he needed the money.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.751
Wouldn't you do anything

40:20.751 --> 40:22.253
for the people that you love, Detective.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.255
- Hey! I'm asking the questions.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.507
You do not talk about my family.

40:27.925 --> 40:28.801
- Excuse me.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.680
- Do you understand?

40:33.848 --> 40:34.682
- Yeah.

40:39.145 --> 40:42.106
- John ever pay you back?
- No.

40:42.106 --> 40:42.940
- Nothing.
- No.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.695
- I once loaned a friend of mine, 2000

40:47.695 --> 40:49.196
and when he didn't pay me back,

40:49.196 --> 40:51.615
I wanted to punch his lights out.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.869
But 10,000, you must
have been going crazy.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.372
- You'd think so, wouldn't you?

41:06.922 --> 41:09.592
- I'll call.
- Call.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.637
(laughing)

41:13.637 --> 41:14.638
- We need to talk.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.057
- Hold on, give me a second,
I'm in the middle of a hand.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.017
- A king and four, you got nothing.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.852
- Oh, what do you doing?

41:21.437 --> 41:22.521
- You like that, huh?

41:24.106 --> 41:26.275
- I guess I'm folding.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.194
Be right back.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.361
- Hell, I'll call.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.157
- Kings and sevens.

41:33.157 --> 41:37.870
- Two pair, seven and sevens.
- Damn it.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.582
- What's the hell is matter with you.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.416
I was gonna win that hand.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.250
- Where the hell is my money?

41:43.250 --> 41:44.960
- Don't worry, it's coming.

41:44.960 --> 41:45.794
- Bullshit! That's what
you said last week.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.421
- Would you keep your voice down, please.

41:47.421 --> 41:48.589
- What'd you do Johnny?

41:48.589 --> 41:50.424
Did you gamble my money?
- Of course I didn't

41:50.424 --> 41:52.718
as I said, it's invested
in a business venture.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.428
I'm told I'm getting paid soon, double.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.554
- You're full of shit.

41:57.431 --> 41:59.767
You got yourself a cheater in here.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.352
Have a nice game, ass hole.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.104
- He said it was for a business venture

42:04.104 --> 42:06.232
and I'd get my money back
within a couple of weeks.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.733
Of course that never happened.

42:08.734 --> 42:13.280
- Your son ever meet him?
- Once, he didn't approve.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.323
- Why?

42:14.323 --> 42:16.825
- Because he thought he was using me.

42:16.825 --> 42:18.160
- You ever tell your son about the money?

42:18.160 --> 42:20.621
- Hell no, I didn't tell
him about the money.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.039
- Your son ever find out about the money?

42:22.039 --> 42:22.873
- Look, I know where
you're going with this.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.876
My son's been in Afghanistan
for the past four months.

42:25.876 --> 42:26.877
- In all your conversations,

42:26.877 --> 42:30.965
you maybe let it slip to
your son about the money?

42:32.883 --> 42:33.717
Careful what you say,

42:33.717 --> 42:34.677
'cause you do not know what I know

42:34.677 --> 42:38.430
and the last thing you
want to do is lie to me.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.849
- What does he know?
- Nothing I told him.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.519
- You keep me posted.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.689
- I might have mentioned it.

42:47.565 --> 42:51.360
But as I said, my son's
been in Afghanistan.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.696
If you think my son had
anything to do with this,

42:53.696 --> 42:55.030
you're wrong.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.865
You're making a big mistake.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.242
I told you it's Sarah.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.952
She killed John.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.745
What'd she tell you her alibi was?

43:01.745 --> 43:02.580
She went to the movies.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.622
What did she see?

43:03.622 --> 43:06.834
Kindergarten Cartel, please.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.335
Nobody saw that train wreck.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.588
Some LA blogger said
the person that wrote it

43:10.588 --> 43:12.006
should never be able to write again.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.507
- Taste in movies is subjective.

43:16.051 --> 43:18.887
- Did Sarah tell you that John
made her have an abortion?

43:22.182 --> 43:24.685
She was all excited to
be having John's baby,

43:24.685 --> 43:26.604
but when she told him, he flipped out.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.231
He told her that he was gonna dump her

43:29.231 --> 43:31.108
if she didn't get rid of it.

43:31.108 --> 43:33.193
Now Sarah says that
they worked through it.

43:33.193 --> 43:34.862
She forgave him.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.282
But come on, how do you
forgive the unforgivable?

43:40.034 --> 43:42.369
- How do you know so much about Sarah?

43:42.369 --> 43:43.287
- Because that night

43:43.287 --> 43:45.914
after sitting here in this
hell hole for 12 hours,

43:45.914 --> 43:47.833
we all went for a drink.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.877
Sarah likes to talk.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.545
We felt like her therapist.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.842
- Guard.
- What, you don't believe me?

43:56.842 --> 43:59.845
I'm telling you, Sarah's the killer.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.472
You're wasting your time with me.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.729
- Jesus, Duke.

44:08.729 --> 44:09.938
You think we missed something?

44:14.360 --> 44:15.903
- Now they think my son did it.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.906
- That's ridiculous.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.116
If that's all they got then
we know they got nothing.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.118
just like the last time
they brought us in.

44:24.119 --> 44:25.788
- They didn't even know
about Sarah's abortion.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.707
- Hey.
- Sorry, Sarah.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.000
For all I know, you did do it.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.710
- That was out of line.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.837
- Look, I'm gonna say
whatever I have to say

44:33.837 --> 44:35.130
to clear my name.

44:36.423 --> 44:39.134
- Forget what we all agreed to, huh?

44:39.134 --> 44:41.804
It's like it's everybody for themselves.

44:41.804 --> 44:46.809
And just for the record, John
and I worked through all that.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.811
Okay, so.
- Oh no, you didn't.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.939
Nobody works through that shit.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.484
- Speaking from experience?

44:57.111 --> 45:00.072
- No, just our experience with John.

45:07.621 --> 45:08.747
- Want a glass of wine or something?

45:08.747 --> 45:10.874
Come on, you know I hate drinking alone.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.418
- No honey, I can't.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.049
- You can't, you mean you don't want to.

45:20.342 --> 45:25.139
- No, mean I actually can't,

45:27.683 --> 45:30.018
not for at least the next eight months.

45:35.274 --> 45:39.069
- Are you telling me what
I think you're telling me?

45:39.069 --> 45:42.573
(laughing)
- I'm pregnant.

45:43.824 --> 45:44.658
We're gonna have a baby.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.995
- Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.248
Well, how did this happen?

45:51.248 --> 45:52.166
I thought you were on the pill.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.543
- I know, I am.

45:54.543 --> 45:59.006
I guess we're part of that rare 0.9%.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.090
It's called a happy accident.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.967
- No, no, no, there's
nothing happy about this.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.385
I'm not ready to be a father.

46:04.386 --> 46:07.848
- I mean, are you ever ready?

46:07.848 --> 46:10.184
Listen, you're gonna be an amazing father.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.602
- Yeah, let me rephrase that.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.187
I don't wanna be a father.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.856
Okay, you can't have this baby.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.567
- What? No.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.403
- Sarah, you can't have this baby.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.240
- I thought you'd be happy.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.788
- You believe in the
right to choose, right?

46:31.914 --> 46:33.749
- Of course.
- Yeah, right.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.335
So do I and I choose for
you not to have this baby.

46:36.335 --> 46:39.505
- I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.672
- What do you mean?

46:40.672 --> 46:42.341
You know what this is bullshit.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.175
- Stop it.

46:46.887 --> 46:49.056
(sobbing)

47:09.743 --> 47:11.787
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

47:11.787 --> 47:15.457
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.585
Just sit down, we'll talk.

47:21.046 --> 47:21.964
- Stop.
- Okay.

47:31.181 --> 47:36.186
Listen, do you know why
I fell in love with you?

47:39.314 --> 47:44.194
Because you're smart, you're
talented, you're beautiful

47:46.905 --> 47:48.657
and you're the sweetest
person in the world,

47:48.657 --> 47:49.950
everything that I'm not.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.329
- Don't say that.
- No, it's true.

47:55.372 --> 47:58.250
Being around you makes me a better person.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.007
The first night I saw you,

48:05.007 --> 48:06.717
pirouetting on that stage.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.763
I said to myself, I
have to meet this angel.

48:13.223 --> 48:14.558
And not only did it meet you,

48:14.558 --> 48:16.018
but we fell in love with each other.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.896
I mean, how that
happened, I'll never know.

48:20.022 --> 48:22.983
(laughing)

48:22.983 --> 48:25.527
- You can be pretty charming, sometimes.

48:31.825 --> 48:36.788
- Look, the future is
super bright for us, Sara

48:37.039 --> 48:39.124
and I'm telling you soon enough,

48:39.124 --> 48:42.252
we're gonna get married and
we're gonna start a family.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.965
But now is just not the right time.

48:49.051 --> 48:52.304
And I promise you, I promise you

48:52.304 --> 48:54.181
that there's gonna be
plenty of more chances

48:54.181 --> 48:55.474
for us to start a family.

48:59.811 --> 49:04.733
Please, I'm begging you to
do this one thing for me.

49:06.652 --> 49:10.739
I'm just not ready to be a father.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.370
- Why did we even sign
that stupid piece of paper.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.788
Now we're all stuck here.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.750
- Because we're all innocent.

49:23.126 --> 49:24.419
- You know, there was something weird

49:24.419 --> 49:26.463
that happened when I was in there though.

49:27.464 --> 49:28.298
- What?

49:29.591 --> 49:30.884
- I was trying to explain to him

49:30.884 --> 49:33.095
that I would do anything
for the people that I loved.

49:33.095 --> 49:36.598
I asked him if he would, all
of a sudden, he flipped out.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.560
- Are you thinking he's
distracted by something?

49:40.560 --> 49:42.229
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.190
I'm just not sure what it is.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.780
- Excuse me, guard.
- What are you doing?

49:54.866 --> 49:56.868
- I need to make a phone call.

49:56.868 --> 49:57.995
- I'm supposed to let the detectives know

49:57.995 --> 49:59.538
if you plan on calling a lawyer.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.958
- I'm not calling a lawyer,
I'm calling my assistant.

50:02.958 --> 50:04.501
I do own a business.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.846
Operator, I need to make a collect call.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.597
- I would love to go with you.

50:17.597 --> 50:18.473
Are you kidding me?

50:18.473 --> 50:20.308
Thank you.

50:20.308 --> 50:22.436
Oh my God, can you hold on for one second.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.895
I just have to hold on, okay.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.524
Joan's advertising.
- Alice, it's me.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.652
- Hey, are you doing okay?
- Stop talking.

50:30.652 --> 50:33.447
- How did you not know this?

50:33.447 --> 50:35.490
- Sara never mentioned.

50:35.490 --> 50:38.785
- I know, but why didn't she mention it?

50:38.785 --> 50:42.664
- Easy, your motive to focus on her.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.167
- Maybe.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.794
- Humiliation, embarrassment, regret,

50:47.794 --> 50:49.796
self-loathing, take your pick.

50:50.630 --> 50:53.258
No offense, gentlemen,
but you got a big fat zero

50:53.258 --> 50:56.720
on trying to figure out how a
woman deals with an abortion.

50:56.720 --> 51:01.725
This self-doubt alone
could haunt her for years.

51:01.767 --> 51:04.269
- How long does it take to
get over something like that.

51:04.269 --> 51:07.147
- Okay, just focus on the big picture.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.566
Ask yourself what is the number one cause

51:09.566 --> 51:12.611
for murder investigation
in the last 10 years?

51:12.611 --> 51:13.445
- Money.

51:14.613 --> 51:17.032
- Let me know when you have any updates.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.325
- Will do.

51:18.325 --> 51:23.330
- Oh, and gentlemen,
you never get over it.

51:30.045 --> 51:31.296
- Okay Duke, let's assess where we are.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.465
All right, what do we know?

51:33.465 --> 51:35.675
I know that somebody
gets their throat slashed

51:35.675 --> 51:36.718
and stabbed 17 times.

51:36.718 --> 51:39.304
Odds are pretty good that
they know their attacker.

51:39.304 --> 51:42.182
However, we have one suspect,
Karen who doesn't care.

51:42.182 --> 51:44.059
Sara, she cares too much

51:44.059 --> 51:45.435
and even though she said she didn't do it,

51:45.435 --> 51:46.937
Cassandra, she wants to throw a party

51:46.937 --> 51:48.396
now that it happened.

51:48.396 --> 51:50.774
- Now you go a taste of
I've been dealing with.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.151
- Can you do me a favor.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.612
Before you bring Ms. Jones back in,

51:55.612 --> 51:57.614
can you give me the transcript
of the interview he did

51:57.614 --> 52:00.450
with Sara Dobson and the
first time you brought her in?

52:00.450 --> 52:03.453
- You got it.
- Yeah, thanks.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.333
- Oh man, that is terrible.

52:13.421 --> 52:14.256
Who?

52:15.632 --> 52:16.633
So which one of you went to the movies

52:16.633 --> 52:17.926
the night John Was killed?

52:18.885 --> 52:20.053
- Hell if I know.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.973
As I said, I was having dinner

52:22.973 --> 52:24.808
at my assistant Alice's house.

52:24.808 --> 52:25.642
- Oh, that's right.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.018
No one else saw you, right?

52:29.813 --> 52:32.732
- When's the last time you
went to the movies, detective?

52:33.733 --> 52:36.987
Actually, when's the last
time you did much of anything?

52:37.904 --> 52:40.157
Word on the street is that
you've been off the job

52:40.157 --> 52:42.242
for the last two years.

52:45.203 --> 52:47.330
- We're not talking about me.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.665
What are you afraid of, detective?

52:48.665 --> 52:49.666
- I'm not afraid of anything.

52:49.666 --> 52:50.500
- Well, then let me speak.

52:51.334 --> 52:52.335
Who knows, detective?

52:52.335 --> 52:56.882
I might just reveal something
to you and not even know it.

53:03.847 --> 53:08.852
Christmas Eve, 2017,
Molly and Jessica Keating

53:10.020 --> 53:11.980
driving down Pacific coast highway

53:12.856 --> 53:15.734
when a car jumped the median, hit them.

53:18.236 --> 53:19.571
Both were killed instantly.

53:22.407 --> 53:25.285
- Don't you talk about
my wife and daughter.

53:25.285 --> 53:28.121
Apparently the driver of the car swerved

53:28.121 --> 53:31.541
when some tunnel piping fell
off the truck in front of him.

53:31.541 --> 53:34.044
He should've swerved right,

53:34.044 --> 53:36.713
but unfortunately he swerved left.

53:36.713 --> 53:39.216
- You have no right to talk
about my wife and daughter.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.383
- Temper, temper, detective.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.802
You don't want to bias the investigation,

53:42.802 --> 53:44.137
making it personal.

53:45.305 --> 53:49.351
But of course, how
could it not be personal

53:49.351 --> 53:51.269
when the driver's name was John Davis?

53:53.605 --> 53:54.522
- Oh Jesus.

53:56.733 --> 53:59.152
- You have and idea
what I've been through.

53:59.152 --> 54:02.697
- Ruled an accident, my
ex-boyfriend walked free,

54:03.657 --> 54:06.117
your wife and daughter are dead.

54:06.952 --> 54:09.621
And yet you sit in
front of me and tell me,

54:09.621 --> 54:12.374
you can be unbiased?

54:13.541 --> 54:16.127
- You don't think that when
I heard John Davis was dead,

54:16.127 --> 54:19.005
part of me felt awesome?

54:19.005 --> 54:20.507
Wouldn't be human if I didn't.

54:21.716 --> 54:22.968
But this is my job.

54:24.052 --> 54:25.679
This is what I do.

54:25.679 --> 54:26.763
I solve murder cases

54:26.763 --> 54:29.808
and you're not gonna turn
this into a shit show.

54:29.808 --> 54:30.642
- As far as I'm concerned,

54:30.642 --> 54:32.811
this whole investigation is a shit show.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.147
Be honest detective.

54:37.315 --> 54:39.442
Aren't you glad he's dead?

54:41.987 --> 54:43.154
- Oh no, don't.

54:43.154 --> 54:44.447
- Maybe you killed him?

54:46.950 --> 54:49.703
You say it's personal, detective.

54:50.704 --> 54:51.788
Personal to whom?

54:54.916 --> 54:56.918
(screaming)

54:56.918 --> 54:58.003
- You want personal?

54:58.003 --> 54:59.671
You really want personal?

54:59.671 --> 55:02.340
Bring up my wife and daughter
again and I'll kill you.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.675
- Scott! Stop!

55:03.675 --> 55:05.135
What are you doing?

55:05.135 --> 55:05.969
Get her out of here.

55:05.969 --> 55:06.928
- The man threatened to kill me.

55:06.928 --> 55:09.180
I don't care what I
signed, I want my lawyer.

55:11.766 --> 55:13.101
- What happened to my phone call?

55:13.101 --> 55:15.020
- Why don't you take a
few minutes and calm down.

55:15.020 --> 55:18.315
- How can you sit by and be replaced

55:18.315 --> 55:20.233
by somebody so incompetent?

55:21.359 --> 55:22.736
Did you see him in there?

55:24.279 --> 55:25.447
He's falling apart.

55:25.447 --> 55:27.365
- There's no way to
justify the way he behaved.

55:27.365 --> 55:28.533
- What happened, Karen?

55:29.492 --> 55:31.077
- Why don't you give it a break?

55:32.495 --> 55:34.706
John ever tell you about
the accident he had

55:34.706 --> 55:36.207
a couple of years ago?

55:36.207 --> 55:38.543
The one that killed two people.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.628
- Yeah, he told me.

55:40.628 --> 55:43.256
- Yeah, the one on Christmas Eve, right?

55:43.256 --> 55:44.799
- Turns out the victims

55:45.925 --> 55:48.720
were the detective's wife and daughter.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.554
- What?
- Yeah.

55:50.764 --> 55:53.433
- He's the one that's
investigating this case?

55:53.433 --> 55:56.561
- No, you can question him all you want.

55:56.561 --> 55:59.939
This guy's never wrong, ever.

55:59.939 --> 56:00.982
- Come on, detective.

56:02.150 --> 56:04.569
You know, we're all innocent.

56:06.071 --> 56:09.783
- You may not be guilty, but
no one in here is innocent.

56:15.830 --> 56:19.125
(breathing heavily)

56:19.125 --> 56:19.959
- Get out!

56:33.765 --> 56:36.434
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't.

56:38.144 --> 56:39.896
- What am I thinking about doing?

56:39.896 --> 56:43.108
- If you think about telling
Diane what happened, don't.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.567
She'll take me off the case.

56:44.567 --> 56:47.570
Look, I know I screwed up in there.

56:50.490 --> 56:53.701
- I told you in the very
beginning that I was a cop first.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.206
Hey man, you blew up.

56:58.206 --> 56:58.998
It happens.

57:02.043 --> 57:03.336
But come on, man.

57:03.336 --> 57:04.754
She baited you good.

57:06.756 --> 57:07.924
- I guess she did, huh?

57:13.847 --> 57:15.390
- As long as you're not
drinking on the job,

57:15.390 --> 57:17.725
which was clearly not
because I would know,

57:17.725 --> 57:19.185
I have nothing to tell Diane.

57:21.187 --> 57:22.021
- Thanks, Duke.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.653
- Who you got coming in next?

57:28.653 --> 57:30.905
- Got a video conference
with Francine Davis.

57:32.323 --> 57:35.160
Gotta find out what her
relationship with their son was.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.247
- I tell you what, why
don't I handle that one?

57:40.957 --> 57:42.375
- What, in front of Diane?

57:42.375 --> 57:43.960
- You need to chill.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.795
Maybe you'll see something watching that

57:45.795 --> 57:47.714
you wouldn't conducting the interview.

57:48.631 --> 57:51.593
When we resume with the ladies,
you'll be back in the room.

57:54.846 --> 57:55.680
- Okay.

57:58.766 --> 57:59.601
- Good.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.899
- Ms. Davis, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.525
It should only take a few minutes.

58:07.525 --> 58:09.277
- Good call letting Duke take this.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.572
- Ms. Davis, did you know Karen Jones,

58:12.572 --> 58:15.116
Cassandra King or Sara Dobson personally?

58:16.075 --> 58:17.118
- No, I didn't.

58:17.118 --> 58:19.245
John and I didn't see
each other very often,

58:19.245 --> 58:21.539
so I never had the chance to meet them.

58:21.539 --> 58:23.500
However, I did speak on the phone

58:23.500 --> 58:25.418
from time to time with Sara.

58:25.418 --> 58:27.754
- And did any of them attend the funeral?

58:27.754 --> 58:30.215
- No, I held the service here in Florida.

58:30.215 --> 58:32.258
So none of them attended.

58:32.258 --> 58:35.512
- How would you characterize
your relationship with John?

58:35.512 --> 58:37.180
- What do you mean by that?

58:38.348 --> 58:39.224
- Was it a good relationship?

58:39.224 --> 58:40.558
Did you get along?

58:40.558 --> 58:41.935
Did you see each other often?

58:41.935 --> 58:45.813
- I guess I'd say we got
along pretty normally.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.233
The last time I saw John,

58:48.233 --> 58:50.944
was at the reading of my husband's will,

58:50.944 --> 58:52.403
about two years ago.

58:56.115 --> 58:57.825
- Sorry, I'm late.

58:57.825 --> 59:01.204
My secretary is out having a root canal.

59:02.080 --> 59:04.374
- It's nice of you to show up.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.875
- Don't listen to him, Anthony.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.877
It's fine.
- Shut up, Francine.

59:09.879 --> 59:13.424
- Before we get to it, I would
like to say a few things.

59:13.424 --> 59:15.969
- That's cool, but can you make a quick.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.971
- John, please show some respect.

59:19.472 --> 59:22.767
- I've known Howard now
for almost 30 years.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.438
I mean he was the best mentor and friend

59:27.438 --> 59:30.817
that I could have possibly hoped for.

59:30.817 --> 59:34.487
When I interviewed to
work here, right here,

59:34.487 --> 59:36.614
really right out of law school,

59:37.448 --> 59:40.159
I mean, Howard took me to lunch

59:40.159 --> 59:43.871
and he made me drink
three martinis with him.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.958
And then he asked me if I would do

59:46.958 --> 59:49.836
a five-minute closing argument

59:49.836 --> 59:53.756
overturning Plessy versus Ferguson, 1896

59:53.756 --> 59:58.261
would be known now as Brown
vs. Board of education, 1954.

59:58.261 --> 1:00:01.222
I mean I'm half of the
bag and I give it a shot.

1:00:01.222 --> 1:00:04.017
And a week later, I get the job.

1:00:04.851 --> 1:00:07.562
And a month later, I asked Howard,

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:11.566
I said, "Howard," I said,
"why did you make me do that?"

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:15.570
And he says, and I quote, he said,

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:19.365
"Anthony, I have landed more clients

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:23.661
"and I have billed more
clients at lunch meetings,

1:00:23.661 --> 1:00:24.662
"drinking martinis."

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:26.748
(laughing)

1:00:26.748 --> 1:00:28.791
And he said you may or
may not be a good lawyer,

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:30.376
but if you're gonna work for me

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:32.962
I've got to know that you're
gonna be at your best,

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:34.464
no matter how many drinks in.

1:00:36.090 --> 1:00:37.800
- That was my Howard.

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.260
(laughing)

1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:40.094
- Yeah, that's a nice story.

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:41.804
Now, can we get on with the, you know.

1:00:41.804 --> 1:00:44.015
- I hope he gave you nothing.

1:00:44.015 --> 1:00:45.600
You can't even mourn correctly.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.727
You are disgrace to his memory.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:48.561
- Yeah, whatever.

1:00:51.022 --> 1:00:51.856
- Please continue.
- Sure.

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:54.359
Maybe we should just get to it.

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:58.696
- All right, let's take a look.

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:04.619
To the love of my life, Francine,

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:11.793
I leave all my assets, the
house, the car, the boat,

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:13.920
our summer home in Key West.

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:14.754
- Oh, come on.

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:20.677
- Now, as far as any financial assets,

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:22.929
I've set aside $7 million.

1:01:22.929 --> 1:01:27.225
five million to be paid to
my wife, Francine immediately

1:01:27.225 --> 1:01:31.104
and on his 50th birthday,
my son, John Davis

1:01:31.104 --> 1:01:34.399
shall receive the remaining $2 million.

1:01:34.399 --> 1:01:35.400
- Fuck yeah.

1:01:38.319 --> 1:01:40.947
- It is my hope that by the age of 50,

1:01:40.947 --> 1:01:43.282
John will have found his purpose in life

1:01:43.282 --> 1:01:45.201
and this money will secure his future.

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:47.370
But I must be clear, he says.

1:01:48.663 --> 1:01:51.999
I just channeled Howard's finger.

1:01:51.999 --> 1:01:52.834
- My Howie.

1:01:55.128 --> 1:01:57.296
- Not one penny shall
be dispersed to my son

1:01:57.296 --> 1:01:58.840
at any time before 50.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:02.135
Any financial assets
North of the $7 million

1:02:02.135 --> 1:02:03.886
will go to cover legal expenses

1:02:03.886 --> 1:02:07.598
and the remainder donated to
the Wounded Warrior Project.

1:02:08.850 --> 1:02:10.184
And that's it.

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:14.856
- God, if he had known what type of person

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:18.025
you'd become he never would
have given you that money.

1:02:18.025 --> 1:02:20.319
- Fuck off Francine, I'm rich.

1:02:20.319 --> 1:02:23.239
Anthony, see you in two years.

1:02:27.410 --> 1:02:28.244
- Okay.

1:02:29.412 --> 1:02:31.038
- So all in all, you would say

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:33.541
it was a pretty good relationship.

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:37.336
- Yes, absolutely.
- Thank you for your help.

1:02:37.336 --> 1:02:40.631
- Please get justice for my son.

1:02:45.636 --> 1:02:47.346
- Good job, Duke.
- Really?

1:02:48.473 --> 1:02:50.850
I don't think we learned anything.

1:02:50.850 --> 1:02:51.684
- Thoughts?

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:53.895
- And I'm gonna need to see

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:55.354
the security footage from the theater

1:02:55.354 --> 1:02:58.566
and I need Cassandra
King in for five minutes.

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:05.072
- Not nice to keep a lady waiting.

1:03:05.072 --> 1:03:06.115
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1:03:06.115 --> 1:03:06.949
Sorry about that.

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:09.410
Important call, really had to take it.

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:12.955
- Heard there were a lot
of fireworks earlier.

1:03:14.248 --> 1:03:16.918
- It's a heck of a
coincidence, huh detective.

1:03:16.918 --> 1:03:19.045
- So the night John was killed,

1:03:19.045 --> 1:03:23.925
you were at the bar in the
back office doing paperwork.

1:03:23.925 --> 1:03:26.761
- I was.
- Who was bartending?

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:27.804
- Milo.

1:03:27.804 --> 1:03:29.847
He's been with me for about four years.

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:32.308
A great employee, very trustworthy.

1:03:32.308 --> 1:03:35.019
- You fell asleep there,
waking up there in the morning.

1:03:35.019 --> 1:03:38.731
- Look, we've already been
through this like 20 times, yes.

1:03:38.731 --> 1:03:41.609
- And Milo saw you, but didn't wake up.

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:43.361
- It happens all the time.

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:44.904
That's why he's got his own set of keys.

1:03:44.904 --> 1:03:46.572
He closes up for me.

1:03:46.572 --> 1:03:49.575
- And the camera's in the
bar, in the back office

1:03:49.575 --> 1:03:51.202
they weren't working because?

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:54.121
- Because they're fake, they never have.

1:03:54.121 --> 1:03:56.666
- How convenient for you?
- Not really.

1:03:56.666 --> 1:03:58.918
If they were working, I wouldn't
be sitting here with you.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:02.588
I'd be at home playing with
my dog or working at the bar,

1:04:02.588 --> 1:04:04.215
or you know, living my life.

1:04:04.215 --> 1:04:05.174
- Oh, I love dogs.

1:04:05.174 --> 1:04:08.135
What kind do you have?
- A rescue.

1:04:09.095 --> 1:04:11.430
Pit bull mix, Sheba.

1:04:13.349 --> 1:04:15.768
What kind do you have?
- I don't have a dog.

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:21.357
It's the night John was killed.

1:04:24.986 --> 1:04:28.781
It's the knife. You never
bought a military grade knife.

1:04:28.781 --> 1:04:33.786
- No.
- Guard, please let him in.

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:40.501
How are you, sir?

1:04:40.501 --> 1:04:41.627
Thank you for taking
the time to come down.

1:04:41.627 --> 1:04:42.753
- My pleasure.

1:04:42.753 --> 1:04:46.299
- For the record, could
you state your name.

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:47.842
- Dan Dooley.

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:49.343
- And what is it you do
for living Mr. Dooley?

1:04:49.343 --> 1:04:51.762
- I run a sporting goods store
in Studio City, California.

1:04:51.762 --> 1:04:52.847
You should stop by sometime.

1:04:52.847 --> 1:04:54.891
We'll give you a discount.
- Okay, fantastic.

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:56.434
And you guys are doing well.
- Oh, excellent.

1:04:56.434 --> 1:04:58.269
I mean 3 million in sales last year.

1:04:58.269 --> 1:05:00.438
We're about to open up
a new store in Arcadia.

1:05:00.438 --> 1:05:01.772
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:05:01.772 --> 1:05:03.065
- And can you say for the record,

1:05:03.065 --> 1:05:06.193
whether or not you recognize
the woman sitting here today?

1:05:06.193 --> 1:05:07.403
- Absolutely, sure do.

1:05:07.403 --> 1:05:09.322
She came in and bought a
knife a couple of months back.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:11.657
- With the store having
that much business,

1:05:11.657 --> 1:05:13.618
how are you certain that
this woman here came in-

1:05:13.618 --> 1:05:15.411
- This is ridiculous, all right.

1:05:15.411 --> 1:05:16.621
- Are you kidding?

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:18.539
I mean, do you know how many
women that look like her

1:05:18.539 --> 1:05:19.916
come into my store?

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.208
I didn't wait on her personally.

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:22.501
One of my employees did.

1:05:22.501 --> 1:05:24.295
And of course with those types of knives,

1:05:24.295 --> 1:05:26.047
we have to do a little bit of checks,

1:05:26.047 --> 1:05:29.050
make sure that not on parole,
probation, that type of thing.

1:05:29.050 --> 1:05:31.427
And so when she came back
in to pick up the knife,

1:05:31.427 --> 1:05:32.261
she had to deal with me

1:05:32.261 --> 1:05:34.472
because she had to sign the paperwork.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:35.765
- So you are 100% certain

1:05:35.765 --> 1:05:38.935
that this young lady
brought a knife off him.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:41.437
- Oh, absolutely.
- This is ridiculous.

1:05:42.855 --> 1:05:44.607
- Thank you very for coming down, Dan.

1:05:44.607 --> 1:05:46.442
- My pleasure.
- All right.

1:05:46.442 --> 1:05:48.653
- But sir, was that the
only thing I bought?

1:05:49.779 --> 1:05:51.948
- Yeah, I think so.
- Think harder.

1:05:53.532 --> 1:05:55.242
- That's right.

1:05:55.242 --> 1:05:58.913
She bought a lockbox, a
very expensive one, too.

1:05:58.913 --> 1:05:59.789
- That's right.

1:05:59.789 --> 1:06:03.584
I left and I came back and I
asked you about the lockbox

1:06:03.584 --> 1:06:06.003
and I bought the exact
one you recommended.

1:06:06.003 --> 1:06:07.213
- That's right, I remember now.

1:06:07.213 --> 1:06:09.507
And let me tell you, beautiful product.

1:06:09.507 --> 1:06:11.008
You should probably get one for yourself.

1:06:11.008 --> 1:06:13.219
- And if you check UPS
International Shipping,

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:15.471
you'll see that I believe next week,

1:06:15.471 --> 1:06:18.307
I sent it to my son overseas.

1:06:18.307 --> 1:06:21.018
I'm telling you, no matter what you think,

1:06:21.018 --> 1:06:22.979
I didn't kill anyone.

1:06:26.607 --> 1:06:27.483
- Thank you, Dan.

1:06:27.483 --> 1:06:28.317
You can go.

1:06:34.949 --> 1:06:36.367
- Well, it checks out.

1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:40.162
She sent it 10 days later,

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:45.167
but she sent it. Corporal
Santos signed for the package.

1:06:45.584 --> 1:06:47.336
- Yeah, you know what,
you were right, Duke.

1:06:47.336 --> 1:06:50.089
I now understand your
frustration with this case.

1:06:51.132 --> 1:06:52.675
All my experiences as a detective,

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:55.886
I know one of them did
it, but like you said,

1:06:55.886 --> 1:06:57.680
this thing is all over the map.

1:06:59.765 --> 1:07:01.559
Any suggestions you have, I'll take.

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:06.814
- Well, you know,

1:07:07.857 --> 1:07:11.277
we've been focusing on
attacking their credibility,

1:07:11.277 --> 1:07:13.904
asking them a bunch of questions,
trying to trip them up.

1:07:13.904 --> 1:07:18.117
But if you asked me, my
money's on Cassandra King.

1:07:20.494 --> 1:07:21.912
- Yeah, I think I'm with you.

1:07:22.788 --> 1:07:25.666
I mean, Sarah would not
kill somebody like this

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:26.792
and Karen, she wouldn't do it herself.

1:07:26.792 --> 1:07:28.044
She'd hired somebody.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:28.878
- So let's go with that.

1:07:28.878 --> 1:07:30.004
We'll connect the dots.

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:31.714
Let us squirm until she confesses.

1:07:31.714 --> 1:07:34.425
Look, she had access to the knife,

1:07:34.425 --> 1:07:37.094
he owed her money and she
sure as hell had the hate.

1:07:37.094 --> 1:07:38.262
- Yeah, but the knife was shipped off

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:39.430
weeks before the murder.

1:07:40.431 --> 1:07:41.974
- Yeah, there's that of course.

1:07:44.435 --> 1:07:45.227
- Detectives.

1:07:47.354 --> 1:07:49.065
- Here's the transcript you asked for.

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:52.068
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:53.652
- Got the Sara Dobson interview?

1:07:53.652 --> 1:07:54.487
- Yeah.

1:07:56.447 --> 1:07:57.782
You know what it gets me though

1:07:57.782 --> 1:08:01.494
is that why she paid
$1,500 for that knife?

1:08:01.494 --> 1:08:03.329
- That's how much they cost?

1:08:03.329 --> 1:08:07.333
- No, because I call five
different sporting goods stores,

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:10.211
including Dan's to get comparative price.

1:08:10.211 --> 1:08:13.047
So the high end was $549...

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:16.801
(tense music)

1:08:20.054 --> 1:08:21.806
- The manufacturer had an
option for a custom handle

1:08:21.806 --> 1:08:24.350
that would favor a
left-handed or right-handed.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:27.686
That knife cost $1,500.

1:08:30.439 --> 1:08:32.233
- Boom.
- What?

1:08:35.486 --> 1:08:37.738
(laughing)

1:08:39.073 --> 1:08:39.907
What?

1:08:41.742 --> 1:08:44.078
- I want to tell you a little story

1:08:44.078 --> 1:08:47.957
and when I'm done, one
of you is not going home.

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:50.751
- Is it time to call my lawyer?

1:08:50.751 --> 1:08:54.046
- No, they'll be time a little
bit later, but like I said,

1:08:55.548 --> 1:08:57.758
I'm just gonna tell you a little story.

1:08:57.758 --> 1:08:58.884
- Then get on with it.

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:01.095
- I first wanna say

1:09:01.095 --> 1:09:02.972
I know that John Davis,

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:06.559
he was no boy scout,

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:12.565
but nobody deserved to be
killed as savagely as he was.

1:09:14.191 --> 1:09:18.612
Now first Karen Jones,
I want to... Ms. Jones,

1:09:18.612 --> 1:09:20.114
I first want to apologize.

1:09:22.074 --> 1:09:24.994
I said a couple things that I
shouldn't have, and I'm sorry.

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:27.329
- Apology accepted.

1:09:27.329 --> 1:09:29.248
- Karen, you were married to Michael Jones

1:09:29.248 --> 1:09:31.542
for eight years before divorcing him

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:32.585
and reading the court papers

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:36.130
it was a pretty nasty divorce.

1:09:36.130 --> 1:09:38.966
Even at the gall to
ask for spousal support

1:09:38.966 --> 1:09:41.844
after cheating on her with
an ex high school girlfriend.

1:09:43.554 --> 1:09:44.471
- What a dick.

1:09:44.471 --> 1:09:46.599
And I don't believe that someone
who went through all that

1:09:46.599 --> 1:09:49.852
would what savagely kill
someone for cheating on him.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:53.731
But I think the thing that got you was

1:09:53.731 --> 1:09:55.774
was that he got away with it.

1:09:55.774 --> 1:09:57.484
He got one over on you.

1:09:59.695 --> 1:10:02.239
And like you said, you
wanted to kill someone,

1:10:02.239 --> 1:10:03.073
you wouldn't do it yourself.

1:10:03.073 --> 1:10:04.116
You'd hire somebody.

1:10:05.075 --> 1:10:07.077
- Right, so I can go now, yeah?

1:10:07.077 --> 1:10:11.040
- Now Cassandra.
- Bring it.

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:13.417
- You on the other hand
had all the reason.

1:10:13.417 --> 1:10:14.919
Not only was John cheating on you,

1:10:14.919 --> 1:10:17.963
but he also owed you 10 grand.

1:10:17.963 --> 1:10:19.173
And I know you ain't the kind of woman

1:10:19.173 --> 1:10:21.592
that's gonna get played.
- Damn straight.

1:10:21.592 --> 1:10:24.553
- Now we know the knife that
killed John was military grade

1:10:24.553 --> 1:10:26.430
but we also know the only
knife that we know about

1:10:26.430 --> 1:10:28.557
was shipped over to
Afghanistan three weeks ago.

1:10:28.557 --> 1:10:30.309
So we're sure that that knife

1:10:30.309 --> 1:10:31.685
could not have been the murder weapon.

1:10:31.685 --> 1:10:34.939
- Finally, that's what I've
been telling you all along.

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:37.483
- But here's the thing.
- What?

1:10:37.483 --> 1:10:40.069
- You didn't buy that night for your son.

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:41.403
- What are you talking about?

1:10:41.403 --> 1:10:43.113
- You may have sent it to him,

1:10:44.865 --> 1:10:46.158
but you bought that knife for John.

1:10:52.623 --> 1:10:53.457
Thank you, Duke.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:55.918
Hang out.

1:10:55.918 --> 1:10:57.628
- Go on my son's social media

1:10:57.628 --> 1:11:00.339
and you'll see pictures
of that exact knife.

1:11:00.339 --> 1:11:02.925
- You knew John couldn't
buy the knife himself

1:11:02.925 --> 1:11:05.970
with his previous record and
the conditions of his parole,

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:07.805
he couldn't buy anything.

1:11:07.805 --> 1:11:11.725
So he gave you $1,500 for a
knife that usually costs 500.

1:11:12.601 --> 1:11:14.061
- Why?

1:11:14.061 --> 1:11:16.272
- I guess because it's
somebody else's money.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:19.525
- No, no, no, because he wanted you

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:22.194
to get a special made grip
for someone left-handed.

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:28.534
See, Duke just handed of me this photo.

1:11:28.534 --> 1:11:32.288
This is a picture of John,
we got from his home.

1:11:33.539 --> 1:11:34.665
You can take a look closer,

1:11:34.665 --> 1:11:37.251
you can see the driver
head, notice anything?

1:11:38.127 --> 1:11:40.462
- Yeah, John was a lefty golfer.

1:11:40.462 --> 1:11:43.799
- John was left-handed.

1:11:43.799 --> 1:11:46.135
Every time he went to sushi,

1:11:46.135 --> 1:11:48.554
he would go into the booth first

1:11:48.554 --> 1:11:50.889
so he wouldn't keep hitting
me with his chop sticks.

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:52.975
It was really cute.

1:11:52.975 --> 1:11:55.644
- Correct, John was left-handed.

1:11:55.644 --> 1:11:59.273
Now this is something
that Duke just handed me

1:11:59.273 --> 1:12:01.525
from the Department of Defense

1:12:01.525 --> 1:12:04.236
that your son filled out
when he joined the Army.

1:12:04.236 --> 1:12:06.280
Care to guess what it says?

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:09.199
- That he was right-handed.
- Bingo.

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:12.619
Now this is where it gets a little funky.

1:12:12.619 --> 1:12:14.621
You said by your own statement

1:12:14.621 --> 1:12:17.124
that you were leaving the store, stopped,

1:12:17.124 --> 1:12:18.125
decided to keep the knife,

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:20.586
that's when you went
back and bought the box.

1:12:20.586 --> 1:12:23.922
Yeah, you probably thought
this guy owes me $10,000

1:12:23.922 --> 1:12:26.383
and I'm just gonna hand
them over a $1,500 knife.

1:12:27.259 --> 1:12:28.093
No, no.

1:12:28.093 --> 1:12:31.263
So that's according to Sarah's testimony.

1:12:31.263 --> 1:12:32.723
When you probably came up with the idea

1:12:32.723 --> 1:12:36.101
to fill the box with dog
shit and send it to John.

1:12:37.269 --> 1:12:39.313
(laughing)

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:41.065
- But you already know,

1:12:41.065 --> 1:12:44.485
I sent that knife to my son
before John was ever killed.

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:45.319
- That's right.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:48.447
You did do that, didn't you?

1:12:50.157 --> 1:12:51.742
- Now, Sarah, you said
you were at the movies

1:12:51.742 --> 1:12:54.161
during the time of John's murder, correct?

1:12:54.161 --> 1:12:55.954
- Yeah, that's correct.

1:12:55.954 --> 1:13:00.959
- This is a security still from
the night John was murdered

1:13:01.835 --> 1:13:05.005
and you can clearly see
Sarah walked into the theater

1:13:05.005 --> 1:13:06.090
with a, with a soda and a popcorn.

1:13:06.090 --> 1:13:07.508
If you look right up here in the corner,

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:11.887
you can see a little timestamp, 8:40.

1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:14.807
Now, you fast forward two hours later

1:13:14.807 --> 1:13:19.353
and you can see the crowd
walking out and there's Sara.

1:13:22.648 --> 1:13:24.691
- Hey, so we're seeing Sara's alibi.

1:13:24.691 --> 1:13:25.776
So we can all go now, right?

1:13:25.776 --> 1:13:27.778
- Well not quite see.

1:13:27.778 --> 1:13:30.906
You see the sweater Sara's wearing.

1:13:37.121 --> 1:13:37.955
- I was wearing a sweater.

1:13:37.955 --> 1:13:39.665
I mean, it's cold in movie theaters.

1:13:39.665 --> 1:13:40.958
Everyone knows that.

1:13:40.958 --> 1:13:42.584
- Yeah, but you see Sara,

1:13:42.584 --> 1:13:46.588
the thing is that we found
these fibers in John's blood

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:50.926
and is from a very rare material
nowadays called Chanille.

1:13:50.926 --> 1:13:53.595
- My mom got that sweater as a child

1:13:53.595 --> 1:13:54.680
and she gave it to me.

1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:59.351
And just because there's material,

1:13:59.351 --> 1:14:02.104
that doesn't make me a murderer.

1:14:02.104 --> 1:14:04.356
- No truer words have been said, Sara,

1:14:04.356 --> 1:14:06.608
but you know, it got me thinking.

1:14:07.484 --> 1:14:09.570
In your interview,

1:14:10.904 --> 1:14:13.198
in your interview with Detective Brown,

1:14:13.198 --> 1:14:16.827
you were very specific about
a review of the movie you saw.

1:14:16.827 --> 1:14:19.121
- Kindergarten Cartel, terrible reviews.

1:14:20.247 --> 1:14:21.540
- Yes, they were were horrible.

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:23.333
Weren't they, Cassandra?

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:28.297
In fact, you quoted me from
an LA blog reviewer who said,

1:14:31.425 --> 1:14:33.886
whoever came up with that idea

1:14:33.886 --> 1:14:36.805
should be banned from
ever writing movies again.

1:14:37.639 --> 1:14:42.644
Harsh. Yet, here's Sara's
interview with Duke

1:14:42.769 --> 1:14:43.937
three weeks ago.

1:14:43.937 --> 1:14:46.231
Duke: what movie did you see?

1:14:46.231 --> 1:14:48.901
Sara: Kindergarten Cartel.

1:14:48.901 --> 1:14:50.527
Duke: any good?

1:14:50.527 --> 1:14:52.946
Sara: it was beyond bad.

1:14:54.406 --> 1:14:58.285
In fact, whoever came up with that idea

1:14:58.285 --> 1:15:01.663
should be banned from
ever writing movies again.

1:15:01.663 --> 1:15:05.834
Huh, either that's a Mega
Ball type coincidence

1:15:05.834 --> 1:15:10.506
or maybe you didn't see the movie at all.

1:15:13.342 --> 1:15:16.386
- Well, you clearly see that
I've went to the movies.

1:15:16.386 --> 1:15:19.640
- Sara.
- But I didn't do it.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:20.474
I swear.

1:15:20.474 --> 1:15:22.684
- Coercing someone into
getting an abortion.

1:15:23.977 --> 1:15:25.020
You were thinking the two of you

1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:26.188
were gonna get married the whole time

1:15:26.188 --> 1:15:29.608
only to find out he was cheating on you.

1:15:29.608 --> 1:15:31.276
- Damn Sara, you did do it.

1:15:31.276 --> 1:15:35.656
- Our poor innocent Sara
went to the movies at night.

1:15:37.241 --> 1:15:38.534
When the lights went down,

1:15:40.118 --> 1:15:41.453
she snuck out of the back,

1:15:42.496 --> 1:15:47.167
went over to John's house and killed him.

1:15:47.167 --> 1:15:48.001
- No.

1:15:48.001 --> 1:15:49.878
- Security said there
was an unauthorized exit

1:15:49.878 --> 1:15:52.339
from the movie theater at 8:52

1:15:52.339 --> 1:15:54.466
and then another one at 10:24.

1:15:54.466 --> 1:15:55.926
You taped the back door shut

1:15:55.926 --> 1:15:58.762
so that when it closed, it didn't lock.

1:15:58.762 --> 1:15:59.680
- No.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:00.514
- Then you drove over to John's.

1:16:00.514 --> 1:16:01.932
- No, no, no, no.

1:16:01.932 --> 1:16:03.100
That is not what happened.

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:04.893
- The fibers they found at the crime scene

1:16:04.893 --> 1:16:06.645
match exactly to the sweater

1:16:06.645 --> 1:16:07.980
that you're wearing in this photo

1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:10.524
and forensics even
estimated that the fibers

1:16:10.524 --> 1:16:12.109
are at least 50 years old.

1:16:12.109 --> 1:16:13.402
- And you said that, that was the sweater

1:16:13.402 --> 1:16:15.696
that your mother wore as a child.

1:16:15.696 --> 1:16:17.239
- No, listen to me, I want to speak.

1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:24.288
The truth is I have no idea
what happened that night.

1:16:25.414 --> 1:16:27.874
All I know is that I sat in my seat,

1:16:28.875 --> 1:16:31.211
and then I was woken
up at the end credits.

1:16:32.212 --> 1:16:35.299
I know, I know that sounds crazy

1:16:35.299 --> 1:16:37.134
but that is the truth, okay.

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:40.095
I didn't leave by way of the exit.

1:16:40.095 --> 1:16:44.057
I didn't tape the door and I
certainly didn't kill John.

1:16:44.057 --> 1:16:45.642
I loved him.

1:16:45.642 --> 1:16:46.977
- Sara, look what you put us through.

1:16:50.897 --> 1:16:51.732
- Wait a second.

1:16:51.732 --> 1:16:52.566
What about the weapon?

1:16:52.566 --> 1:16:55.611
You said that it was a
very uncommon knife, okay.

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:57.738
How would I get ahold of it?

1:16:57.738 --> 1:16:59.364
How would I kill him with that?

1:16:59.364 --> 1:17:04.369
- We found this two-sided
tape on the ground

1:17:05.537 --> 1:17:06.580
in a spot of water.

1:17:08.165 --> 1:17:10.792
So here's what Sara did.

1:17:12.919 --> 1:17:13.920
You were there when John received

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.255
the package Cassandra sent.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.342
John was so mad that he
kicked you and the box

1:17:18.342 --> 1:17:19.384
outside of his house.

1:17:22.387 --> 1:17:27.100
Took the box home, cleaned
it out, filled it with water,

1:17:28.226 --> 1:17:29.978
put it into the freezer.

1:17:29.978 --> 1:17:33.315
And boom. Hour later, a perfect replica

1:17:34.191 --> 1:17:35.609
of the military grade knife.

1:17:37.110 --> 1:17:39.363
The two-sided tape
wrapped around the handle

1:17:39.363 --> 1:17:41.073
so it wouldn't slip.

1:17:41.073 --> 1:17:42.199
Put in a little cooler

1:17:43.116 --> 1:17:45.994
and then when you left the movie theater,

1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:47.245
you drove over to John's,

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:52.292
you lured him outside and you killed him.

1:17:58.340 --> 1:17:59.174
Stand up.

1:18:01.259 --> 1:18:02.344
Stand up!

1:18:05.639 --> 1:18:07.599
Sara Dobson, you're under arrest

1:18:07.599 --> 1:18:09.935
for the murder of John Davis.

1:18:09.935 --> 1:18:11.561
You have the right to remain silent.

1:18:11.561 --> 1:18:14.481
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1:18:14.481 --> 1:18:15.315
in a court of law.

1:18:15.315 --> 1:18:17.192
You have the right to an attorney.

1:18:17.192 --> 1:18:18.026
If you can not afford an attorney-

1:18:18.026 --> 1:18:20.570
- Scott, congratulations, excellent work.

1:18:20.570 --> 1:18:23.031
I never would have come
up that. The ice knife.

1:18:23.031 --> 1:18:23.865
Brilliant.

1:18:25.325 --> 1:18:27.119
- It wasn't just me, it was everybody.

1:18:27.119 --> 1:18:27.953
- No, I can't tell you what a win

1:18:27.953 --> 1:18:28.870
this is for the department

1:18:28.870 --> 1:18:31.832
and I hope that this means
you'll be back permanently.

1:18:31.832 --> 1:18:33.333
- Well, if Duke handles
the processing papers,

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:35.419
I'll think about it.
- I'm on it baby.

1:18:36.878 --> 1:18:39.089
- I got to go set up a press conference.

1:18:39.089 --> 1:18:42.801
You coming?
- Spotlight's more your thing.

1:18:45.929 --> 1:18:47.180
- Great to have you back.

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.267
- After a grueling investigation,

1:18:50.267 --> 1:18:52.018
I'm happy to announce an arrest

1:18:52.018 --> 1:18:54.646
in the connection of the
killing of John Davis.

1:18:54.646 --> 1:18:57.691
And I wanna thank the DA and her team

1:18:57.691 --> 1:18:59.192
for a job well done.

1:18:59.192 --> 1:19:01.236
Now I'm gonna ask Diane
to say a few words.

1:19:01.236 --> 1:19:02.988
- Thank you, mayor.

1:19:02.988 --> 1:19:06.199
It's been a grind, but this
department couldn't have done it

1:19:06.199 --> 1:19:09.369
without detective Scott
Keating and Duke Brown.

1:19:09.369 --> 1:19:12.289
And with that, are there any questions?

1:19:16.835 --> 1:19:19.421
(mellow music)

1:19:20.714 --> 1:19:23.216
- Excuse me, when you get a
chance, can we have the check?

1:19:23.216 --> 1:19:24.342
- Of course.
- Great.

1:19:26.928 --> 1:19:29.097
- And I'll take this
whenever you're ready.

1:19:30.682 --> 1:19:31.516
- Thank you.

1:19:46.281 --> 1:19:47.115
- Hey.

1:19:47.991 --> 1:19:48.825
(laughing)

1:19:48.825 --> 1:19:50.452
- Hey, small world.

1:19:50.452 --> 1:19:53.121
I forgot you work around here.
- Yeah.

1:19:53.121 --> 1:19:55.248
It's hard to break away during the week,

1:19:55.248 --> 1:19:57.959
but I like to get over here
in the weekends, if I can.

1:20:00.712 --> 1:20:05.342
So I heard Sara's attorney
and the prosecution

1:20:05.342 --> 1:20:08.136
made a plea deal.
- Yeah, 12 years.

1:20:09.930 --> 1:20:12.140
- How do you feel about that?

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:13.058
- It's not my job to feel.

1:20:13.058 --> 1:20:15.352
It's my job to get to the truth.

1:20:15.352 --> 1:20:16.561
But if you're asking as a civilian,

1:20:16.561 --> 1:20:18.855
I think she made the right choice.

1:20:19.981 --> 1:20:23.777
Minimum 25 if she lost at
trial, that's too much to risk.

1:20:23.777 --> 1:20:26.571
- Yeah, I get that.

1:20:28.073 --> 1:20:32.077
Please tell the DA, apology accepted.

1:20:33.078 --> 1:20:35.705
- I will.
You want anything?

1:20:35.705 --> 1:20:37.207
I haven't paid yet.

1:20:37.207 --> 1:20:38.792
- Oh no, I'm gonna grab something to go.

1:20:38.792 --> 1:20:40.544
I've got a weekend
meeting with an attorney

1:20:40.544 --> 1:20:42.295
who wants to advertise.

1:20:42.295 --> 1:20:44.965
Ironic, huh?
- I'm sure you'll do great.

1:20:48.051 --> 1:20:49.427
- Hey listen, I want to say,

1:20:49.427 --> 1:20:54.266
I really am sorry about what
happened to your family.

1:20:58.103 --> 1:20:59.312
- You know what again, in a weird way,

1:20:59.312 --> 1:21:01.231
it's kind of good for me.

1:21:02.107 --> 1:21:02.941
- How so?

1:21:04.234 --> 1:21:05.068
- Well, you know, I've been
running for the past two years

1:21:05.068 --> 1:21:07.153
and this case made me stop

1:21:08.196 --> 1:21:09.614
had to finish the grieving process.

1:21:09.614 --> 1:21:12.909
And if it took finding
the killer of the guy

1:21:12.909 --> 1:21:17.205
who took my family, then
you know what, even better.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:22.502
- Mind if I run something by you?

1:21:23.587 --> 1:21:24.421
- Shoot.

1:21:26.214 --> 1:21:28.967
- Look, I know all the
evidence points to Sara,

1:21:30.385 --> 1:21:31.970
but what if she's telling the truth?

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:38.018
- Guilty people lie all the
time, believe me, she's guilty.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:39.561
- What if she's not?

1:21:41.021 --> 1:21:44.691
- Look, Sara arrives at the
theater for an 8:45 movie.

1:21:44.691 --> 1:21:46.776
Now she says she doesn't remember anything

1:21:46.776 --> 1:21:49.738
from the time she got
there til the end credits.

1:21:49.738 --> 1:21:50.697
- Correct.
- Okay.

1:21:52.115 --> 1:21:56.036
What if somebody drugged her?
- Drugged her?

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:57.829
So now we're bringing in drugs, huh?

1:21:57.829 --> 1:22:00.874
- People get distracted at
movie theaters all the time.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:03.752
All it takes is waiting
for the right moment.

1:22:04.628 --> 1:22:05.712
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1:22:05.712 --> 1:22:07.505
- I'm having trouble
taking off my backpack.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:09.299
Can you help me?
- Yeah, of course.

1:22:09.299 --> 1:22:12.969
It would be so easy for
someone to just lean over

1:22:12.969 --> 1:22:15.639
and put a little something in her drink.

1:22:15.639 --> 1:22:16.473
- Of course.

1:22:19.059 --> 1:22:20.602
There you go.
- Thank you.

1:22:20.602 --> 1:22:22.187
- Enjoy the movie.
- You too.

1:22:27.692 --> 1:22:30.779
- Two to three minutes later,
she was out like the light.

1:22:35.158 --> 1:22:38.411
A person then grabs some
fibers from Sara's sweater

1:22:38.411 --> 1:22:40.455
and heads over to the exit,

1:22:40.455 --> 1:22:43.708
making sure to put a little
tape on the exit to get back in.

1:22:44.542 --> 1:22:46.086
That person is then picked up

1:22:46.086 --> 1:22:49.339
and the two drive to John's house.

1:22:49.339 --> 1:22:51.424
- How'd it go?
- Perfect.

1:22:51.424 --> 1:22:53.051
We've got 74 minutes, let's roll.

1:22:54.719 --> 1:22:56.137
- After they get to John's house,

1:22:56.137 --> 1:22:58.932
one of them takes him outside to distract

1:22:58.932 --> 1:23:00.392
while the other gets ready.

1:23:02.435 --> 1:23:05.647
When the time is right, they strike.

1:23:05.647 --> 1:23:06.898
- Remember me?

1:23:18.868 --> 1:23:20.286
- After John is dead,
they leave a few fibers

1:23:20.286 --> 1:23:23.164
from a rare sweater in a
pool of blood on the ground,

1:23:25.792 --> 1:23:28.336
leaving the murder weapon to melt away,

1:23:28.336 --> 1:23:30.714
but making sure the tape was found.

1:23:39.514 --> 1:23:41.891
10 minutes later, the movie ends.

1:23:43.226 --> 1:23:45.228
- That was a lousy movie.

1:23:45.228 --> 1:23:47.022
- Excuse me lady, are you okay?

1:23:49.482 --> 1:23:50.316
- Yeah.

1:23:51.943 --> 1:23:54.195
- So what do you think?

1:23:56.072 --> 1:23:57.574
Could that be possible

1:23:57.574 --> 1:23:59.576
or just one of my wacky theories?

1:24:01.494 --> 1:24:05.040
- Hey, how you doing Eddie?

1:24:06.958 --> 1:24:09.210
(chuckles)

1:24:10.628 --> 1:24:11.713
What, no hello?

1:24:13.465 --> 1:24:15.759
- I just ran my theory by the detective

1:24:15.759 --> 1:24:19.262
about Sara being innocent
of John's murder.

1:24:20.847 --> 1:24:22.474
I think he's still taking it in.

1:24:24.893 --> 1:24:28.313
- I thought it was crazy when
she told me too detective.

1:24:28.313 --> 1:24:29.481
Crazy possible.

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:33.151
- So you just basically
killed a man for nothing

1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.071
and Sara's gonna rot in
jail for the next 12 years

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:39.449
for a crime she didn't
commit because he cheated,

1:24:39.449 --> 1:24:40.283
because he owed you money?

1:24:40.283 --> 1:24:41.326
He was broke, so what?

1:24:42.619 --> 1:24:44.454
- Are you sure about that, detective?

1:24:47.499 --> 1:24:48.500
- What the hell is going on?

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.126
- I may have shared his last name,

1:24:50.126 --> 1:24:53.004
but John was never my real son,

1:24:53.004 --> 1:24:56.299
but you knew that, right detective
or did you miss that too?

1:24:57.133 --> 1:24:59.344
When my husband died two years ago,

1:24:59.344 --> 1:25:02.055
I wasn't aware that he had set
up a trust fund for his son

1:25:02.055 --> 1:25:04.974
for when he turned 50. $2 million!

1:25:06.976 --> 1:25:09.229
How unfortunate that he didn't make it.

1:25:10.438 --> 1:25:12.899
- Let me guess, you got the money.

1:25:13.733 --> 1:25:17.195
John has been nothing but
a loser his entire life.

1:25:17.195 --> 1:25:19.906
And Sara called me crying
and told me about the night

1:25:19.906 --> 1:25:21.825
they all found out about his cheating,

1:25:21.825 --> 1:25:24.494
I decided to reach out to these two,

1:25:24.494 --> 1:25:26.746
get a feel so to speak.

1:25:26.746 --> 1:25:31.000
It didn't take much, but look
at the bright side, detective.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.463
Sarah may be an innocent
woman doing some hard time,

1:25:35.463 --> 1:25:37.173
but I made sure that her mother

1:25:37.173 --> 1:25:40.218
doesn't have to worry about
that pesky foreclosure anymore.

1:25:42.178 --> 1:25:46.015
- Francine's extra 500,000
reasons for each of us

1:25:46.015 --> 1:25:48.601
wouldn't make it hard to decide.

1:25:49.769 --> 1:25:52.480
- Are you three confessing right now?

1:25:53.648 --> 1:25:56.860
- Come on, detective,
like Francine would pay us

1:25:56.860 --> 1:25:59.737
half a million dollars
each to kill her stepson.

1:26:01.156 --> 1:26:02.907
- Hell I would have done it for 10.

1:26:04.617 --> 1:26:06.828
- I just wanna say thank you, detective.

1:26:07.662 --> 1:26:10.582
The city is so much safer
today because of you.

1:26:17.338 --> 1:26:18.464
- So much safer.

1:26:22.177 --> 1:26:23.261
- Absolutely.

1:26:29.767 --> 1:26:32.020
- I won't let you get away with this.

1:26:32.020 --> 1:26:33.730
- How long away?

1:26:33.730 --> 1:26:34.898
Two years away?

1:26:35.815 --> 1:26:37.734
You got overconfident.

1:26:37.734 --> 1:26:39.527
I know how the justice department works.

1:26:39.527 --> 1:26:41.404
47 wins and no losses,

1:26:41.404 --> 1:26:43.531
how many of those people
were in innocent too?

1:26:44.490 --> 1:26:46.826
Yeah, when I found out

1:26:46.826 --> 1:26:48.328
that John killed your wife and daughter,

1:26:48.328 --> 1:26:51.748
it didn't take much for you
to make it personal, did it?

1:26:52.999 --> 1:26:56.961
And in the process, you
lost track of the truth

1:26:56.961 --> 1:27:00.590
and Sara lost everything.

1:27:02.175 --> 1:27:04.719
Chew on that for the next 12 years.

1:27:13.853 --> 1:27:16.898
(phone ringing)

1:27:16.898 --> 1:27:19.734
- Brown.
- They played me Duke.

1:27:21.277 --> 1:27:23.154
- Where have you been?

1:27:23.154 --> 1:27:25.448
I've called and text you
for the past three days.

1:27:25.448 --> 1:27:27.492
- Duke, damn it, the look on their faces.

1:27:28.493 --> 1:27:29.327
- Are you drunk?

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:35.166
- Sara Dobson didn't kill John Davis.

1:27:35.166 --> 1:27:37.001
- Where's this coming from?

1:27:37.001 --> 1:27:39.254
- You got to get Diane to reopen the case.

1:27:39.254 --> 1:27:41.464
- It's not gonna happen, Scott.

1:27:41.464 --> 1:27:43.549
The investigation is closed.

1:27:43.549 --> 1:27:45.176
She pled guilty, end of story.

1:27:45.176 --> 1:27:46.636
- No, no.

1:27:46.636 --> 1:27:48.388
I have to let her know that
I know that she's innocent.

1:27:48.388 --> 1:27:50.932
- All she'll see is the
man who destroyed her life.

1:27:53.643 --> 1:27:54.477
Scott.

1:28:00.858 --> 1:28:04.445
- [Officer] Inmate Dobson,
you have a visitor.

1:28:19.168 --> 1:28:23.298
- Wow, I never thought I'd see you again.

1:28:27.010 --> 1:28:28.344
Did you come here to gloat?

1:28:30.471 --> 1:28:33.308
I can't even believe you at
the nerve to show up here.

1:28:37.145 --> 1:28:39.188
You ruined my life.

1:28:41.232 --> 1:28:43.276
You ruined my life!

1:28:45.194 --> 1:28:46.029
Look at me.

1:28:48.239 --> 1:28:49.782
For the next 12 years,

1:28:51.326 --> 1:28:55.204
I want you to know that you put
an innocent woman in prison.

1:28:57.957 --> 1:29:00.043
Now I know that you may not believe that,

1:29:03.046 --> 1:29:05.006
but that is my truth

1:29:05.006 --> 1:29:07.300
and that is the only
thing that matters to me.

1:29:13.848 --> 1:29:14.682
What?

1:29:21.272 --> 1:29:23.191
You got nothing to say?

1:29:26.736 --> 1:29:29.906
