18:15.750 --> 18:17.959
I wasn't playing music,

18:15.750 --> 18:17.959
I swear.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.250
I swear on my mother's boozle.

18:21.291 --> 18:25.709
- I don't care about your music

18:21.291 --> 18:25.709
or your mother's... boozle.

18:25.750 --> 18:29.250
That is not the Henry we know.

18:25.750 --> 18:29.250
- What?

18:29.291 --> 18:31.959
- That Henry and that Charlotte

18:29.291 --> 18:31.959
are from an opposite universe.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.750
- Ah, of course.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.750
That's why she looks so weird.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.750
- Uh, have you

18:35.792 --> 18:37.750
looked in a mirror?

18:37.792 --> 18:39.500
- Okay, come on.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.959
We just want to get

18:39.542 --> 18:41.959
back home to our universe.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.458
- And we need to get our

18:42.000 --> 18:44.458
Henry and Charlotte back here

18:44.500 --> 18:47.875
because these ones are lame.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.458
- Hey, did you figure out

18:47.917 --> 18:49.458
what went wrong

18:49.500 --> 18:51.333
and why we're here

18:49.500 --> 18:51.333
in this universe?

18:51.375 --> 18:53.208
- I think so.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.917
See, when we were coming down

18:53.250 --> 18:54.917
the tubes in our universe,

18:54.959 --> 18:56.667
the other Henry and Charlotte,

18:54.959 --> 18:56.667
from this universe,

18:56.709 --> 18:58.166
were coming down those tubes.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.375
- Ah, and there was

18:58.208 --> 19:00.375
electrical interference

19:00.417 --> 19:01.750
from the storm outside.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.625
- Which is still happening.

19:03.667 --> 19:06.917
- Right. So, if we use the tubes

19:03.667 --> 19:06.917
now before the storm is over,

19:06.959 --> 19:08.959
that might take us

19:06.959 --> 19:08.959
back to our universe.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.375
- The weird looking

19:09.000 --> 19:12.375
girl is right.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.083
- Why don't you shave

19:12.417 --> 19:14.083
that hair tuft

19:14.125 --> 19:15.875
off the top of your head?

19:15.917 --> 19:20.375
- Hey, in my universe

19:15.917 --> 19:20.375
this tuft is cool.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.041
[ phone chimes ]

19:28.083 --> 19:29.792
- Henry, the storm conditions

19:28.083 --> 19:29.792
are changing.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.750
- Then go.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.750
Get on the tube pad now.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.333
- Wait.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.875
If I have two minutes left,

19:39.375 --> 19:42.875
I'm going to use that time

19:42.917 --> 19:44.625
to make a heartfelt speech.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.291
- Oh God.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.291
- Ah geez.

19:46.333 --> 19:50.583
- Listen, in our universe,

19:46.333 --> 19:50.583
Captain Man is a hero

19:50.625 --> 19:53.667
who would never hurt anyone

19:50.625 --> 19:53.667
unless they deserved it.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.041
- Oh, what about me?

19:55.083 --> 19:56.792
- You're a freak

19:55.083 --> 19:56.792
in both universes.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.208
- Yes!

19:58.250 --> 20:00.375
- You have 55 seconds.

20:00.417 --> 20:03.792
- Ray, your ways of

20:00.417 --> 20:03.792
evil are illogical.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.000
You're strong and

20:03.834 --> 20:06.000
indestructible.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.750
- And handsome.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.750
- Okay.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.834
Maybe if instead of

20:08.792 --> 20:10.834
hurting people,

20:10.875 --> 20:12.917
you start being

20:10.875 --> 20:12.917
nice to them,

20:12.959 --> 20:14.375
I think you'll like being

20:12.959 --> 20:14.375
respected

20:14.417 --> 20:17.166
and loved more than you

20:14.417 --> 20:17.166
like being feared.

20:19.041 --> 20:22.750
- I don't know.

20:19.041 --> 20:22.750
I really like being feared.

20:22.792 --> 20:26.792
For example. Boo!

20:22.792 --> 20:26.792
- Aah!

20:26.834 --> 20:28.834
- But maybe you're right,

Henry Hart,

from another universe.

20:31.417 --> 20:37.792
Maybe, from now on

20:31.417 --> 20:37.792
I'll try to be good.

20:39.834 --> 20:43.333
- Ow!

20:43.375 --> 20:46.583
You broke my pinky finger.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.542
- Well, I can't start trying

20:46.625 --> 20:49.542
to be good all of the sudden.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.291
I mean, baby steps.

20:55.917 --> 20:58.083
- You should try

20:55.917 --> 20:58.083
being evil sometimes.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.542
- Arg.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.542
- Because evil is fun.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.041
- Arg!

21:02.083 --> 21:03.417
- Plus it's way better

21:02.083 --> 21:03.417
than just be--

- Will you get

21:03.458 --> 21:05.083
them out of here?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.208
- Wait. No, no, no!

- Wait!

Before I go...

there's one man
