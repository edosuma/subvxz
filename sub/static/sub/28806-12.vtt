01:30.381 --> 01:31.716
<i>Playing it cool.</i>

01:34.219 --> 01:35.887
<i>Playing their game...</i>

01:37.555 --> 01:40.892
<i>while Trish is out there doing damage.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:42.644
<i>To someone.</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:44.395
<i>To herself.</i>

01:49.275 --> 01:50.568
<i>I am done playing.</i>

01:54.739 --> 01:56.533
You trying for an escaping-custody charge?

01:56.616 --> 01:59.327
I didn't kill anyone,
and I have a job to do.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.664
You're free to go.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.209
Why?

02:06.292 --> 02:08.961
You're no longer a suspect
in Officer Nussbaumer's murder.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.257
Because you found the person who did it?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.634
Because the killer struck again
while you were in here.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.720
You have the perfect alibi.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.949
How do you know it was the same killer?

02:21.015 --> 02:23.643
We found Nussbaumer's badge
lying on the body of the victim.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.771
Jace Montero. You know him?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.859
- No.
- You know anyone else who knows him?

02:31.442 --> 02:32.777
Why would I?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.655
A witness saw your masked vigilante friend
near the scene.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.119
I think you're trying
to be on the side of right.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.288
Help us bring her in.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.082
I can't help you.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.302
This is the 40th call.
Again, call me back.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.805
Call Trish every five minutes
until she answers,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.641
and scour all of social media
for any mention of her.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.394
Why aren't you moving?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.664
Hey...

03:08.688 --> 03:09.731
That's why.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.108
I'm drowning.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.946
I'm drowning.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.701
He was passed out on the office floor
when I got here.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.785
Refused to leave.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.913
Said he had something
important to tell you.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.456
Why am I always drowning?

03:26.539 --> 03:29.167
Ugh, I think I pulled my back
getting him in there.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.423
She's in trouble, Jess.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.967
I think Trish crossed the line.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.012
By murdering Nussbaumer and Montero
with your help?

03:41.095 --> 03:42.472
No, I didn't...

03:42.555 --> 03:46.893
I mean... yes, she...
she asked for my help. I owed her.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.811
- You lied.
- No, I didn't touch 'em.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.939
And... And Nussbaumer was an accident.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.274
You brought her down to your shitty level.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.906
Yes, I... I screwed up.
It's on me. It's all... It's all...

04:07.580 --> 04:08.915
She was clear.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.044
I didn't feel it... until I did.

04:14.128 --> 04:18.466
She must have shut down something
in order to... do what she did.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.137
And... there's something else.

04:23.221 --> 04:27.267
When they died... my headaches lifted.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.603
It was like the balance
of all the crap in the world

04:30.687 --> 04:33.690
suddenly tilted toward... good.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.193
It was... It was euphoric.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.950
- The headache, one to ten.
- For Trish?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.745
Five... ish.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.874
You suffer that kind of loss,
you lose pieces of yourself.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.669
Yeah, but maybe... maybe not permanently.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.087
Where is she?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.174
I told her I wouldn't let her
use my radar anymore,

05:00.258 --> 05:02.760
and she said she already knew
who her next target was.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.887
Sallinger. He's in the hospital.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.724
If she kills him, she goes darker.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.687
Sober up. I might need you.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.274
You want my help?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.775
No. But you owe me.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.136
Where are you going? You should be in bed.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.167
I'm going home.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.130
You can't just leave
in the middle of the night.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.962
Well, my police protection did.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.631
You're still safer here.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.091
I can protect myself.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.650
- I'm getting you out of here, asshole.
- I'm getting myself out.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.367
Trish!

06:07.450 --> 06:10.119
- Walk away, Jess.
- Are you really gonna do this here?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.538
- You're trying to save him?
- I'm trying to save you.

06:12.997 --> 06:13.997
Don't.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.129
Come on.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.134
Get in.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.939
Why are you running? You can take her.

06:39.273 --> 06:43.152
It's inevitable.
Jessica Jones versus the masked murderer.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.539
Oh, you poor dear.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.666
Don't waste your sympathy
on this piece of shit.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.671
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.850
Where?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.392
Where?

07:25.319 --> 07:26.779
The exit is down.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.656
Let's go!

07:30.908 --> 07:33.303
- We're going to the roof.
- Are you planning to throw me off?

07:33.327 --> 07:34.930
She can't jump as far as I can.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.123
I told you it's inevitable.
Trish will not give up...

07:37.206 --> 07:39.167
Do not say her name.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.043
You're always taking the easy way out.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.005
The easy way out would be
to let her rip the rest of your face off.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.715
Now you're making sense.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.553
Get out of here, Jess.
I'll take care of him.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.013
This isn't you talking.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.933
This is the grief
and the rage that comes with it.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.477
How can you not understand this?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.353
We're gonna put him away. For life.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.981
With what evidence? You destroyed it.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.817
Not all of it.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.651
You do that
and I'll release the photo.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.364
- I don't care, so long as you're dead.
- I want him dead, too.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.951
But I'm the only one willing to do it.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.622
You were willing, too, once,
with Kilgrave.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.209
And it nearly destroyed me.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.336
But it hasn't destroyed me.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.173
Maybe... that's my real power.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.510
I can carry the burden.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.389
You want my differential diagnosis?

09:17.431 --> 09:18.432
No.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.074
Jesus, God.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.493
What are you doing here?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.377
Been here
since 2:00 in the morning,

09:39.453 --> 09:41.539
waiting to dump
this shithead off with you.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.791
- Excuse me?
- Wait. That was your plan?

09:43.874 --> 09:44.874
To leave me with her?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.336
Your client here needs protection.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.005
No. You're my protection.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.840
Okay, I think I have heard everything now.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.043
He needs to stay
in one of your safe houses.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.219
Why would I do that
when I have you on my side?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.013
- You do not have me on your side.
- No?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.682
Then why do you keep saving me from her?

10:00.391 --> 10:03.644
The vigilante? I...
I thought you two were partners.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.448
Are you gonna
take him off my hands or what?

10:05.521 --> 10:08.899
I'm sorry, but Hogarth & Associates
doesn't provide protection.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.027
No, no, you can't afford the overhead.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.738
Then he needs to move in here with you.
I'm out.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.907
What are you gonna do
when you find me beaten to death?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.827
This is what she does.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.207
To protect her, you have to protect me.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.798
I'm going to walk home now.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.052
I'm going to wait for her to arrive.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.928
And then I'm going to put up a fight.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.140
So it'll be her or me.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.852
And I really don't know
which is worse for you.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.527
I'll walk slowly so you can catch up.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.743
Thanks for nothing.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.996
I know it was Trish.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.337
I think that she...
she may have threatened me.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.672
You think?

11:13.422 --> 11:16.258
I asked her to do something for me.
Uh...

11:16.342 --> 11:17.885
Okay, I pressured her.

11:18.552 --> 11:22.014
It was important.
It's a very personal thing.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.061
Should I be worried?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.231
Should I be worried?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.068
You don't fit her profile.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.613
And I'm gonna handle it.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.323
Thank you.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.242
I'm not doing it for you.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.132
She's not here.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.427
I know. She called me.
That's why I'm here.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.431
Okay, good.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.810
I, uh, prefer things out in the open.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.188
She couldn't get a hold of you,
but she told me what she needs us to do.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.274
Wait. What? Who are you talking about?

12:13.357 --> 12:15.151
Jessica. Who are you talking about?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.903
Uh, it's not really my place to say.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.783
Oh, awkward.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.494
But, hey, bro.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.832
I'm just doing her a solid, man.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.355
I think you're doing more than that.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.044
Don't be a dick, Erik.
He's helping me out.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.898
Yeah, but I was helping you out,
getting you home to Georgia.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.884
Georgia is not home
to anything but bad memories.

12:39.967 --> 12:43.053
And rather than tell me that,
you move in next door?

12:43.846 --> 12:47.224
Oh. Wait. You and Jessica
are living together now?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.852
- No. No, I'm just...
- Just doing her a solid, right?

12:54.482 --> 12:55.483
Something's wrong.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.278
It'll be all right.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.156
You look good, Bri.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.952
- You big jerk-off.
- You little shit.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.750
I'm gonna take a shower.
You wanna join me?

13:12.833 --> 13:13.959
Jesus, Bri.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.171
I knew that would get him.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.343
- So Jessica needed us to do something?
- Right.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.929
Uh, if it involves helping Trish,
I'm not...

13:25.012 --> 13:27.431
- We're helping Trish.
- Shit.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.226
It's time to let the cops handle her.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.187
No. It... It's not her fault.

13:33.270 --> 13:37.024
And Jessica is paying you
a shit-ton of money, so...

13:37.107 --> 13:38.150
It's her words, not mine.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.735
...so do your job.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.695
Again, her words, not mine.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.948
You know,
I could end all of this right now.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.213
A few keystrokes, reveal her identity,

14:00.130 --> 14:02.258
let the police take it from there.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.095
Of course,
then I'd be risking imprisonment myself,

14:06.178 --> 14:10.474
because of this so-called evidence
you saved against me.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.894
But you'd also have to believe
it was enough to convict me.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.105
And I'm not sure you do.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.360
If only you had me strapped to a chair
with a lens in my face,

14:21.443 --> 14:23.362
so you could capture my truth.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.137
So it begins.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.591
I assume she's on the rooftop
of the building across the street.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.775
God damn it.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.466
What are you going to do?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.035
Yes.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.079
Yes.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.747
End him.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.881
That's a lot of worms.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.222
That camera uploads to a server.

16:14.807 --> 16:19.019
Would you trust the cloud
with evidence of your sick shit?

16:33.534 --> 16:34.660
Go for it, Jess.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.791
- Jesus. Will she be all right?
- Yeah.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.210
I'll tase her again when she wakes up.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.091
I'm not loving how easy this is for you.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.980
What the hell are you doing?

17:03.063 --> 17:05.315
Saving your life
so I can lock you in a dark cell.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.398
You're lying.

17:08.652 --> 17:09.653
Am I?

17:36.764 --> 17:39.183
Ahh! Shit.

17:46.815 --> 17:47.816
Shit!

17:49.902 --> 17:51.320
Shit!

17:52.112 --> 17:53.489
Everything's out of reach.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.534
What the hell is this?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.079
What are you doing here?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.747
My job.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.124
Jessica.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.628
If this was my play,
you'd be in police custody.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.773
What? Because you're all about justice?

18:10.798 --> 18:14.510
Helping Hogarth exonerate
rapists and murderers?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.594
You're right.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.847
I have a lot to make up for.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.315
You know, Jessica still believes in you.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.193
Well, she believes in Trish.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.154
I'm not even sure who that is anymore.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.241
Carl Nussbaumer killed people.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.119
Montero burned people.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.539
And their reckoning was your job?
That's your defense?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.208
You know, you're not the only one
with a lot to make up for.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.880
It's about... balancing the scales.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.468
Shit!

19:01.765 --> 19:03.892
Do you ever miss
the person you used to be?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.333
All set.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.672
Are you ready for a cozy night at home?

19:35.674 --> 19:36.675
I will be.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.096
- I could use another drink, though.
- Yeah, I don't blame you.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.561
Never seen a guy come back for more.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.439
What, with these healthy pours?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.108
I mean, more of this.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.693
Is that how you talk to a regular?

19:56.653 --> 19:58.363
To repeat business.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.204
You know, we were sitting right here
the night we met.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.709
I'd take it back if I could.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.754
Thanks a lot.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.217
I brought a lot of pain to your world.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.013
It would've found me one way or another.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.686
This, uh... Trish...

20:32.522 --> 20:34.149
It's been a long time coming.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.445
She'll come back.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.867
You brought me back,
and I was a lost cause.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.661
Are you saying you're found now?

20:46.995 --> 20:50.499
That could go either way.
But that's new for me.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.795
I hope it continues.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.798
What, you and me?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.259
The upward swing.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.345
Same thing.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.349
Let's just get through this.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.310
Yeah, to getting through it.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.521
Let's get to work.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.542
It must be maddening
to be this predictable.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.260
Jessica Jones.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.306
Jessica Jones.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.235
Duct tape? Really?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.946
Go ahead. Free yourself.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.038
It's a little something
I added to the tranquilizer.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.916
Causes partial paralysis.

23:46.174 --> 23:51.388
All my good photo gear
is in police lockup somewhere.

23:57.310 --> 24:00.230
You'll join them, real soon.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.649
Because of the evidence you held back?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.487
We'll get to the truth of that later.

24:11.324 --> 24:14.453
You want me to admit I'm a cheater?

24:14.536 --> 24:15.787
A fraud?

24:18.165 --> 24:20.375
I'm both, and more.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.171
I'm more interested
in the deeper lie you tell yourself...

24:25.505 --> 24:27.257
about why you want to be a hero.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.469
Except I don't want it.
I've never wanted it.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.761
And that's the lie.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.932
Because you want it desperately,
and I suspect you always have.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.477
And you certainly fooled Trish.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.020
Had you been honest with her,

24:41.229 --> 24:44.357
she wouldn't have felt obliged
to fill your vacant shoes.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.360
You don't know her. You don't know me.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.530
And I don't have to,
because it's perfectly obvious.

24:51.281 --> 24:56.995
Take your intentionally indifferent
rebel-rock garb for example.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.080
They are your cape...

25:00.957 --> 25:03.877
your mask and your armor.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.715
You're longing for distinction.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.553
Or how about your chosen profession?

25:15.055 --> 25:16.348
A private eye.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.435
It's a lazy clichÃ©...

25:21.686 --> 25:23.355
the individualist hero.

25:23.438 --> 25:24.689
It pays the bills.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.902
Not everyone can live
off of their dead brother's settlement.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.572
Yeah.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.451
Well, let's talk about the dead.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.371
They have played such a role.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.665
Are you hoping that I'll cry?

25:41.748 --> 25:45.752
That I'll beg for my life...
like Dorothy did?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.714
That's not truth.

25:56.471 --> 26:00.016
I want you to accept
what you fear the most...

26:01.226 --> 26:03.520
that your family died for nothing.

26:04.354 --> 26:08.275
You believed they were sacrificed
in exchange for your gifts.

26:08.358 --> 26:12.153
That they died
so that you could save the world,

26:12.737 --> 26:14.197
one person at a time.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.951
And now you pretend
like you never wanted it?

26:19.953 --> 26:22.998
You're terrified
you've already failed them.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.457
And you have.

26:26.626 --> 26:30.505
Because you are not,
and you never will be,

26:31.548 --> 26:32.591
a hero.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.873
The exercise thing,
I do that, too.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.583
Helps keep the cravings at bay, right?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.169
Once an addict, always an addict.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.714
Sometimes, exercise is just exercise.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.759
Whatever works for you.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.345
You know what doesn't work for me?

27:18.428 --> 27:21.264
Is being chained to this pole
like a goddamn animal.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.224
I mean, it's messed up.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.310
Then let me go.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.228
That would be more messed up.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.772
You know, I thought I knew you.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.318
But actually, you're just an asshole.

27:36.905 --> 27:37.906
Well...

27:39.157 --> 27:40.909
my girlfriend would agree with you.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.663
Ex-girlfriend, that is.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.250
You know, I loved her so much.

27:49.334 --> 27:53.546
But the man that she loved,
that... that... good guy...

27:54.798 --> 27:56.049
that just wasn't me.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.096
So I cheated on her.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.349
With a hooker, no less.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.934
And rather than owning up to it,

28:06.017 --> 28:08.603
I made her believe that it was her,
just so that I...

28:11.064 --> 28:15.402
didn't have to see that look on her face
when she realized who I really was.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.362
That's horrible.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.910
Do I deserve to be executed for it?

28:24.911 --> 28:27.497
It's hardly on the same level
as what Sallinger did.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.249
I've destroyed lives.

28:29.332 --> 28:32.836
Like I said, you're an asshole,
but you don't deserve to die.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.254
Some people may disagree.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.887
When I was seven,
my dad still lived at home.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.766
We were happy... when he was sober.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.311
He never physically hurt me.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.190
My mom took all the hits.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.445
But she was too proud to call the police.

29:00.947 --> 29:05.410
One day, I came home and...
he was screaming at her,

29:05.493 --> 29:07.120
and I heard a thump.

29:08.705 --> 29:12.917
And I went upstairs,
and my mom was bleeding.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.463
He had hit her head into the wall.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.594
And that's when I decided...

29:25.013 --> 29:26.055
he had to go.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.394
I touched my mom's blood...

29:33.229 --> 29:38.067
smeared it all over my face, my T-shirt...

29:40.236 --> 29:44.657
and I ran across to the neighbor...
Mrs. Levin...

29:47.327 --> 29:50.121
and I told her my dad had hit me.

29:52.332 --> 29:56.002
You know,
Mom never contradicted me.

29:56.085 --> 29:59.464
I think it's when she first realized
I could act.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.721
My dad was arrested.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.142
I never saw him again.

30:13.686 --> 30:18.358
Now, what I did was wrong...

30:21.152 --> 30:23.446
but it was also right.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.827
So the ends justify the means?

30:32.121 --> 30:33.581
If I want it to end.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.667
Want what to end?

30:37.752 --> 30:41.172
Evil... I guess.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.425
And what if you become the evil?

31:01.234 --> 31:02.485
There it is.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.280
Your truth.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.240
Finally.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.661
Ever try a self-portrait?

31:12.745 --> 31:14.330
No, there's no need.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.125
I live in truth.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.715
So did Dorothy Walker.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.803
She was nothing but truth.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.892
She was ambitious.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.437
Broken.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.648
Sometimes cruel.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.320
But she owned it all.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.281
Every day.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.535
And you killed her anyway.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.414
We're done here.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.794
You need that logic.

32:02.962 --> 32:07.133
Because if they're worthy kills,
you're not just a murderer...

32:10.011 --> 32:11.471
you're something more.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.391
But you're the real fraud,
because you love it.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.812
That's the real reason
you tortured and killed Dorothy, isn't it?

32:20.563 --> 32:22.148
Why you killed them all?

32:22.231 --> 32:24.609
- Because it brings you pleasure.
- No.

32:24.692 --> 32:29.656
You got off on it.
Stabbing her over and over.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.157
No, I didn't.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.742
You and your stiff little knife.

32:32.825 --> 32:34.619
You're probably hard right now,
aren't you?

32:34.702 --> 32:39.415
I killed Dorothy to punish you.
To punish all of you.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.464
Why are you smiling?

32:50.134 --> 32:52.178
You're not the only one with a camera.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.271
I did lie about one thing, though.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.783
You okay?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.078
I am if you got it.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.788
All on camera, start to finish.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.207
Murder, kidnapping,

33:21.290 --> 33:25.086
and in the felony bonus round,
dosing a bottle of good bourbon.

33:29.298 --> 33:32.427
By the way, you look like a real asshole

33:32.510 --> 33:34.929
tippy-toeing around here
in your ninja outfit.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.432
I suppose you think
you're a hero now, too.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.480
Kind of. Yeah.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.820
Hello, Jones.
Haven't seen you on the news lately.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.864
<i>How'd you like
to get back on the job?</i>

33:52.947 --> 33:55.283
The last thing I need
is you mixing it up with brass.

33:55.366 --> 33:59.370
Gregory Sallinger just confessed
to the murder of Dorothy Walker on tape.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.623
- What?
<i>- Single-party permission recording,</i>

34:02.707 --> 34:04.292
admissible by New York law.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.129
And I have him on kidnapping
and attempted murder.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.213
<i>Whose?</i>

34:10.005 --> 34:10.922
Mine.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.507
I'll put out an APB on him.

34:12.592 --> 34:16.219
No need.
You can pick Sallinger up at my office.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.851
Got it. Server's ours.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.732
<i>Should I even ask how the hell
you accomplished that?</i>

34:31.610 --> 34:33.446
<i>Never mind. I don't want to know.</i>

34:34.989 --> 34:36.364
<i>Jones, you there?</i>

34:36.449 --> 34:37.909
And, Costa...

34:38.826 --> 34:41.746
I think you might have missed something
at the Dorothy Walker crime scene.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.498
<i>Copy. On it.</i>

34:56.135 --> 34:58.971
<i>I killed Dorothy to punish you.</i>

34:59.055 --> 35:00.556
<i>To punish all of you.</i>

35:06.020 --> 35:10.441
<i>I killed Dorothy to punish you.
To punish all of you.</i>

35:15.738 --> 35:20.284
<i>I killed Dorothy to punish you.
To punish all of you.</i>

35:25.706 --> 35:28.084
<i>I killed Dorothy to punish you...</i>

35:28.167 --> 35:30.419
Don't forget
to read him his rights.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.684
Do you still dream?

35:48.521 --> 35:51.232
After all the shit that I've done,
I can't really sleep.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.944
I mean, not like I used to.
Doesn't seem to be a problem for you.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.279
Because I'm a monster.

35:56.362 --> 36:00.324
No, because if you felt
even half the remorse that I do,

36:00.408 --> 36:01.909
I don't think you could continue.

36:05.454 --> 36:09.292
I don't dream. I couldn't call it that.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.837
And it's worse than nightmares.

36:15.756 --> 36:19.135
I see them, every time I close my eyes.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.512
And sometimes when I don't.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.640
Nussbaumer, Montero...

36:26.934 --> 36:28.060
Jessica's mother.

36:29.937 --> 36:32.940
That awful moment
when they take their last breath.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.358
The finality of it.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.572
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.492
I did it because I had to.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.828
Maybe it is an addict thing.

36:45.912 --> 36:50.166
Generating change in the world,
being effective, it's a powerful drug.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.293
But it is not easy.

36:53.419 --> 36:57.131
Malcolm, the things I've done...
You're right. It wasn't me.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.966
The old me.

36:59.050 --> 37:04.138
But as long as Sallinger
and other assholes like him are out there,

37:04.222 --> 37:05.973
I don't know if I can get her back.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.104
And I'm not sure that I should.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.785
Sallinger's in jail.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.247
For good.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.291
The photo.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.627
It's destroyed.
Your secret is safe.

37:35.878 --> 37:36.878
How?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.227
This is over.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.354
It isn't satisfying,

37:54.355 --> 37:56.065
it doesn't take away the pain,

37:56.148 --> 37:59.860
and it doesn't affect either of us,
except that he's done.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.029
That's it.

38:06.158 --> 38:09.078
But I'm so... angry.

38:11.872 --> 38:12.873
So am I.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.378
But that's the burden we have to carry.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.303
I'm not sure I can.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.888
Most people can't.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.892
They wind up dead or in jail.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.609
I never meant to hurt you.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.490
Me neither.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.987
Okay, people!
Sixty minutes to <i>Style By Trish!</i>

39:25.071 --> 39:26.572
Set up, we're ready to go.

39:49.220 --> 39:53.599
You are something to behold, lady.
Coming back so soon.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.062
That's what I call strength.

40:00.272 --> 40:01.440
I'm so sorry.

40:02.983 --> 40:05.027
And furious.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.780
I mean, I know they caught him, but...

40:08.489 --> 40:11.742
I wish the death penalty
was legal in this state.

40:11.826 --> 40:16.247
He'll probably use the system
to his advantage. Smart ones always do.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.707
Why couldn't he have just died
in a shoot-out?

40:20.960 --> 40:21.961
Oh, my God.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.172
That's the last thing you need to hear.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.051
No, it's... it's all right.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.556
I can handle it.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.110
Hey, you gotta see Sallinger
in orange, huh?

40:46.193 --> 40:48.737
Yeah... Something like that.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.032
Here, let me drive you.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.204
No, it's okay.
It's not worth the headache.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.372
Literally.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.251
You did this.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.420
You got him.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.175
We got him.

41:09.258 --> 41:12.052
Are you saying I'm some kind of superhero?

41:13.929 --> 41:15.556
On your better days.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.818
Hello?

41:28.694 --> 41:30.654
<i>I expect I'll see you soon.</i>

41:32.406 --> 41:34.909
<i>I understand you looted my apartment.</i>

41:35.826 --> 41:39.246
I wouldn't have exposed her anyways.
It'd be too easy for you.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.001
<i>She's a true believer, Jessica.</i>

41:45.336 --> 41:47.379
<i>And that kind of faith never goes away.</i>

41:47.463 --> 41:48.463
Screw you.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.219
<i>You'll have to face the test eventually.</i>

41:54.011 --> 41:55.763
<i>Can you make the sacrifice?</i>

41:57.139 --> 41:58.140
Will you?

42:02.478 --> 42:04.313
I'm eager to find out.

42:29.088 --> 42:31.423
Pipes. We're five stories down.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.519
Not used to being the one
who's bound up, are you?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.549
Don't open the door.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.717
Jumpy scumbag.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.927
No, no, she's done this before.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.095
It's her.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.514
- It's her. Uncuff me!
- Calm down!

43:20.598 --> 43:22.891
Trust me, it's her! It's her!

43:39.199 --> 43:40.784
All units...

44:03.515 --> 44:06.226
When your client steps off the elevator,
he remains in my custody.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.311
You are not to touch him.

44:07.394 --> 44:09.675
- You will not pass him anything.
- I've been here before.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.112
I'm in chains. I'm in ch...

44:24.828 --> 44:26.330
You're no hero.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.941
- What's taking so long?
- Old equipment.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.567
In the '40s, the tunnel was used

44:55.651 --> 44:58.112
to bring mobsters
from the jail to the courthouse.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.488
Since then, we've been using...

45:02.950 --> 45:05.244
The fourth time you stabbed her.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.454
The fifth.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.498
The slit to her throat.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.918
Those pictures.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.463
What did you need to see?

45:18.757 --> 45:20.008
Her truth.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.095
And now I see yours.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.265
And so will Jessica.

45:42.322 --> 45:43.323
Finally.

45:44.305 --> 45:50.749
