It's...

♪

00:57.891 --> 00:58.957
(passing gas)

01:02.429 --> 01:05.097
Chris, would you like
to read your personal essay?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.932
Okay, Mrs. Donovan.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.070
"Following Mrs. Donovan"
by Chris Griffin.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.272
"The first thing that
Mrs. Donovan does

01:13.274 --> 01:15.174
"when she gets

01:28.122 --> 01:29.588
Chris, I think
you should stop.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.757
What? I'm doing
the best I can.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.725
I'm not Nathaniel
Hawthorne.

(chuckling)

01:35.729 --> 01:37.429
Nathaniel,
what are you doing?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.965
Just ruining ninth
grade for everyone.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.037
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I called you in today

01:45.039 --> 01:46.472
because your son, Chris,
has been getting

01:46.474 --> 01:48.073
in quite a bit of
trouble lately.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.742
In fact, just yesterday,
he tried to pass

01:50.744 --> 01:54.213
this drawing off
as his Advanced Art project.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.215
Oh, my.
I'm very embarrassed.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.883
Well, someone should be.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.118
I'm sorry,
Principal Shepherd.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.086
We've tried talking
to Chris.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.921
We just don't know
what else to do.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.756
Well, I think we may
have a solution.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.925
We have these cats that
hang around the school,

02:06.927 --> 02:08.227
and we feed them.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.394
Why doesn't
Chris come in,

02:09.396 --> 02:11.463
and we can treat him
like one of the cats?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.765
And in a couple of years,
we'll give him a diploma.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.067
That doesn't
sound like

02:15.069 --> 02:16.135
he'll be getting
the best education.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.302
I don't know, Lois.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.872
Some of those cats go on
to get pretty good jobs.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.208
(meows)
Yep.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.747
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
We now return to <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

02:28.749 --> 02:30.115
(eerie whirring over TV)

02:30.117 --> 02:32.251
You will recommend
<i>Breaking Bad</i>

02:32.253 --> 02:34.186
to everyone you know.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.289
I will recommend <i>Breaking Bad</i>
<i>to everyone I know.</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:40.125
<i>Breaking Bad</i> is the best show
you've ever seen,

02:40.127 --> 02:41.760

<i>Breaking Bad</i>
<i>is the best show I've ever seen,</i>

02:44.431 --> 02:46.265

02:46.267 --> 02:47.533
You will never stop talking

02:47.535 --> 02:49.935
about <i>Breaking Bad</i>
<i>or</i> <i>The Wire.</i>

02:49.937 --> 02:53.872
I will never stop talking
about <i>Breaking Bad</i> or <i>The Wire.</i>

02:53.874 --> 02:56.008
Peter, I'm really
worried about Chris.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.943
What are we going
to do about him?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.444
Let's face it, Lois--
the kid's an idiot.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.612
What the hell happened

03:00.614 --> 03:02.314
to all the smart genes
in this family?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.116
I mean, I invent
the razor blade comb,

03:04.118 --> 03:05.517
and my kids
are doing nothing.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.886
I mean, when Chris grows
up, will he even be able

03:07.888 --> 03:10.055
to get a job or take
care of himself?

03:10.057 --> 03:12.191
And what's he going
to do when we die?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.162
♪ Ooga chaka, ooga ooga,
ooga chaka... ♪

03:17.164 --> 03:20.199
♪ I can't stop
this feeling ♪

03:20.201 --> 03:24.136
♪ Deep inside
of me... ♪

03:24.138 --> 03:25.704
I feel awful
saying it,

03:25.706 --> 03:28.207
but I'm kind of embarrassed
by him sometimes.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.042
I know, and he's
got boobs, too.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.543
Stupid guy with boobs.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.212
Acting like he
doesn't want us to look.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.646
He wants us to look.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.148
CHRIS:
Stop making fun of me!

03:36.150 --> 03:37.349
(both gasp)

03:37.351 --> 03:39.585
I just wanted to listen
to you guys have sex,

03:39.587 --> 03:42.187
but you were saying
mean things about me.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.522
Chris!
Oh, my God.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.691
No, we weren't
talking about you.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.192
Yeah, we were talking
about Meg.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.361
We call her Chris
so she doesn't know.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.263
MEG:
(bleep) you!
Shut up, Chris!

03:51.265 --> 03:53.031
I know that's not true.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.833
(sobbing)

03:54.835 --> 03:56.168
Oh, God.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.936
Peter, he heard us
call him stupid.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.271
His own parents.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.439
What have we done?

04:00.441 --> 04:01.607
Well, you know, Lois,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.041
it's never easy
hearing the truth.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.843
Especially from
a fortune cookie.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.182
What does it
say, Peter?

04:10.184 --> 04:11.783
Uh, just something
about perseverance.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.185
What does yours say?

04:13.187 --> 04:15.120
It says I'm
very creative.

04:23.229 --> 04:26.365
Oh, by the way, there's a baby
in my preschool with HIV,

04:26.367 --> 04:28.100
and my teacher gave you
something to sign

04:28.102 --> 04:29.301
to get him kicked out.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.236
Hey, Chris!

04:31.238 --> 04:33.238
There's my big, smart son.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.240
My special guy,
my Chrissy.

04:35.242 --> 04:38.477
Sounds like someone got her
vibrator working again.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.911
Oh, look out, everyone.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.314
Double-digit IQ
joining the table.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.116
Hey, smarty,
think fast.
Aah!

04:44.118 --> 04:46.251
He knows.
He knows it's hot.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.386
'Cause he's smart.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.254
I don't want
to talk to you guys.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.389
You called me
an idiot.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.424
Oh, Chris, you must
have just misheard us.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.992
I was standing
right there.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.294
How is that
possible?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.262
'Cause you're an idiot--
that's how.
Peter!

04:57.264 --> 04:59.965
I'm going
to school!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.333
It's Sunday,
right?

05:01.335 --> 05:04.236
Peter, we've completely
destroyed his self-esteem.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.004
We've got to
do something.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.839
You know, Lois, if Chris is
having confidence issues,

05:07.841 --> 05:09.241
they have camps
for kids like him.

05:09.243 --> 05:10.509
What do you mean?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.277
Well, they take kids
who struggle in school

05:12.279 --> 05:13.612
and help them gain
self-confidence

05:13.614 --> 05:15.280
in a nurturing
environment.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.316
Wow. That's actually
a great idea.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.917
We don't got
no money for camp.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.319
We're saving up
to go to Europe.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.487
Peter, we went to Europe.
You didn't like it.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.189
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.224
My TV isn't here.
Let's go home.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.331
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
We now return
to <i>Canadian Horror Story.</i>

05:32.333 --> 05:34.333
Hey, hon, we're
out of Molson.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.634
Oh, not to worry.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.269
We've got some Labatt's
in the garage.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.204
And could you get one
for the ghost?

05:39.206 --> 05:40.372
Boo, eh?

05:40.374 --> 05:43.041
Hey, Chris,
could we talk to you?

05:43.043 --> 05:45.644
If you're going to insult me
again, just go away.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.346
Look, honey, we're sorry,

05:47.348 --> 05:49.281
and we want to do
something special for you.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.315
This is a Hamilton
Beach blender

05:50.317 --> 05:51.717
we got on our
wedding day.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.118
It keeps coming
back to us

05:53.120 --> 05:54.319
in a vicious
regifting cycle.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.520
No, Peter.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.389
Chris, we were thinking
of sending you to camp.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.225
And we're going to let
you choose which one.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.327
This one's called
Camp Helmet.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.863
This one's called
Camp Sit 'N' Stay.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.865
These camps
don't sound fun at all.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.301
Well, Chris, camp is only
as fun as you make it.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.403
That's how it was
in World War II.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.405
Don't suppose
it would help

06:13.407 --> 06:15.374
to say I have a note
from my doctor.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.843
(laughs)
Get in there, you.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.311
Hey, this one
looks cool.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.712
Space Camp.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.515
"Spend a week doing
intensive math and science,

06:23.517 --> 06:24.916
learning from
real astronauts."

06:24.918 --> 06:26.251
Space Camp?

06:26.253 --> 06:27.719
I'm sorry,
that one must have

06:27.721 --> 06:29.721
accidentally gotten in
with the rest of them.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.224
What are you saying?
That I'm too stupid for it?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.325
Chris, we're over here.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.393
What are you saying?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.161
That I'm too
stupid for it?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.929
No, no,
of course not.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.198
Then this is the camp I choose.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.501
Yay! I get to go
to Space Camp!

06:42.503 --> 06:43.935
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.438
You guys are
the best parents ever!

06:46.440 --> 06:48.774
Would you excuse
me a moment?

06:50.710 --> 06:52.377
These are mine now.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.378
Hey!

06:53.380 --> 06:55.213
Oh, honey, when we
accepted those mugs,

06:55.215 --> 06:56.648
we knew this
could happen.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.524
You know, Chris,
it's not too late

07:05.526 --> 07:07.225
to change your mind
about Space Camp.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.060
Sometimes it can be
tough to fit in

07:09.062 --> 07:10.562
with a new group
of people.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.863
Yeah, I sure
had my troubles

07:11.865 --> 07:13.799
when I got involved
with the Boy Scouts.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.300
At no time were
the campers

07:15.302 --> 07:17.436
and Mr. Griffin naked
simultaneously.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.571
They merely engaged
in horseplay.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.807
Did Mr. Griffin
sodomize the boys?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.911
Mr. Griffin vehemently
denies all allegations.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.612
Mom, I can handle
Space Camp.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.980
I'm not stupid.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.549
Well, regardless,
on the way back,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.884
we're stopping at that Down
syndrome camp we passed.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.287
Peter, that was
the University of Florida.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.227
Welcome to Space Camp.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.596
Hi. We're here to register
our son, Chris Griffin.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.431
Oh, great to
meet you, Chris.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.133
Hey, this kid means
the world to me.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.701
Keep an eye on him, huh?

07:51.737 --> 07:53.004
Hey, what's that?
I thought all

07:53.006 --> 07:54.072
the space shuttles
were decommissioned.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.007
Well, we always keep one
spacecraft flight-ready

07:56.009 --> 07:57.976
in the event a satellite
needs service,

07:57.978 --> 07:59.277
there's a space
station emergency

07:59.279 --> 08:02.013
or an Italian guy needs
to overexaggerate.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.816
I swear to God, Johnny,
I've had it up to...

08:12.158 --> 08:13.825
...here with your BS.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.794
Ooh, he's really
had it this time.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.195
I'm sorry, Louie!

08:17.197 --> 08:18.697
All right, then.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.865
Hey, what's that
in there?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.867
That's a sensory
deprivation room

08:21.869 --> 08:22.968
that prepares
our astronauts

08:22.970 --> 08:24.836
for the terrifying
emptiness of space.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.937
Oh, cool.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.707
Hey, come on, Brian,
try it with me.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.209
(Peter and Brian screaming)

08:31.211 --> 08:33.945
Things got crazy
so fast.

08:36.115 --> 08:36.982
Bye, Chris.
Good luck.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.283
Take care, Chris.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.886
Oh, and hey, if you get
sent off on a space mission,

08:40.888 --> 08:43.221
um, don't be the black guy,
'cause you'll die.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.823
I know you're going
to have fun

08:44.825 --> 08:46.291
and make lots
of good friends.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.559
Yeah, and not
fake friends,

08:47.561 --> 08:49.561
like guys
whose wives are friends.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.795
(women giggling)

08:50.797 --> 08:52.364
You have to get me
that recipe.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.999
Oh, my God,
the cookbook?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.167
It's right in
the kitchen.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.036
Sports?
No.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.971
Movies?
No.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.207
Hiking?
No.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.575
Cars?
No.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.743
Porn?
Porn?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.011
Yes!
Yes!

09:06.013 --> 09:07.245
Gay porn?
No.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.717
Welcome to Space Camp,
everyone.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.352
Be sure to grab
your physics textbooks.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.987
And you may want to brush up

09:15.989 --> 09:18.089
for tomorrow's lecture
on orbital dynamics.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.659
Oh, man. I don't belong here,
and they know it.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.861
People can always sense a fraud.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.696
Gentlemen, it has come
to my attention

09:24.698 --> 09:26.364
that there's
a Chinese among us.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.333
Rest assured, he will be found.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.268
Security is launching
a full-scale investigation

09:30.270 --> 09:31.870
into the
genealogy records

09:31.872 --> 09:33.838
of every single one
of our employees.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.073
This man will be found,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.375
and there will be
dire consequences.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.579
Too bad about
that Chinese guy, huh?

09:42.114 --> 09:43.782
Campers, we are now in

09:43.784 --> 09:45.450
our state-of-the-art
space shuttle simulator.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.419
Hey, you're a girl.
I just figured that out.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.120
By the time you
leave Space Camp,

09:49.122 --> 09:50.255
you will all be familiar

09:50.257 --> 09:52.290
with every device
on board this craft.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.858
What's this button do?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.860
Why don't you go
ahead and push it?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.596
(rock music plays
over speaker)

09:57.598 --> 09:59.164
That's my band.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.636
Okay, campers, let's see
your astronaut haircuts.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.237
Mm-hmm.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.039
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.641
Chris, that's
a Russell Brand haircut.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.242
(British accent):
Oy, I don't know
what happened.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.044
I went to me barber
at the shop,

10:13.046 --> 10:14.613
and I come out,
I'm looking like this.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.481
(laughs) You're talking
different from how I talk.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.950
Here's a bunch of money
to be on TV.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.755
If you all saw <i>Apollo 13,</i>
<i>you know they had to fix</i>

10:23.757 --> 10:26.157
an air scrubber with just
the tools in the capsule.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.094
Griffin, I need you to use
these tools to fix my marriage.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.428
I can't do that.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.064
Well, I can't be
the only one who's trying.

10:38.604 --> 10:39.571
(phone rings)

10:39.573 --> 10:41.239
Hello?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.608
Oh, my God, Chris.
What's wrong?

10:43.610 --> 10:45.110
Mom, I hate it here.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.444
I want to come home.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.746
All the kids are mean,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.514
and I keep messing
everything up.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.950
Even Jinx the Robot
is picking on me.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.353
(robotic monotone):
Hey, you've got
something on your shirt.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.295
Joke complete.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.664
You and dad were right.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.766
I'm not smart enough
to be here.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.834
Can you come get me,
please, Mom?

11:09.836 --> 11:12.170
Okay, honey, of
course we will.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.105
(phone beeps)
Hang on, I got
another call.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.206
Hello?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.142
Lois, I'm at the gym.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.209
I hate it here.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.811
I want to come home.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.146
Everybody's so mean.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.481
And there's this one guy
who follows me around

11:23.483 --> 11:24.849
and calls me fat.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.818
Well, I suppose I...
(phone beeps)

11:26.820 --> 11:28.553
Hang on, honey, I'm
getting another call.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.621
Hello?

11:29.623 --> 11:30.822
Hey, is fat ass
home yet?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.557
Put him on,
I want to talk to him.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.196
Thanks for coming
to get me, you guys.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.397
Hey, no problem.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.733
We spent thousands of dollars
to send you here

11:41.735 --> 11:43.902
and made two trips
to Florida in four days.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.637
I'm glad we had you.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.839
Well, I'm sorry, I thought
I could handle it here,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.074
but I was wrong.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.376
That's okay, honey,
everyone makes mistakes.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.145
Yeah, remember when the fat man
brought home that cougar chick?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.880
You make yourself
comfortable, Beth.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.148
I'll be right back.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.083
Hi, young man.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.350
I'm looking for
a good time.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.552
Uh-huh.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.153
I'm worldly. I'm fun.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.222
This ain't mileage,
this is experience.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.358
Listen, just so there
are no surprises,

12:07.360 --> 12:08.760
don't be scared--
my stuff looks like

12:08.762 --> 12:10.729
someone spilled an
apple pie in my lap.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.530
(groans) Yuck.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.566
Didn't you have any
fun at all, sweetie?

12:14.568 --> 12:17.168
Well, I guess I did get to go
on the space shuttle every day.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.503
Really? No way.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.206
I always wanted to be an
astronaut like Lance Armstrong.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.241
It's Neil Armstrong.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.443
He lied about his name, too?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.784
Wow, this
is amazing, Chris.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.785
Look at this, Lois.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.186
a week ago,
we call him stupid,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.355
and now he's giving tours
of the space shuttle.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.457
Negative reinforcement--
that's the key.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.692
Right, stupid?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.727
Ow! I'll
do better.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.896
So, do you know how
all this stuff works?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.698
Well, I don't know what
most of these buttons do,

12:46.700 --> 12:49.367
but I know this big red one
is the one you press to launch.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.735
Whoo, big red button!

12:50.737 --> 12:51.803
Stewie, no!

12:51.805 --> 12:53.438
(beeping)

12:53.440 --> 12:55.640
(computer whirring)

12:55.642 --> 12:57.142
(engines rumbling)
Uh-oh.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.476
Chris, make it stop.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.711
I'm trying.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.917
(engines roaring)

13:05.919 --> 13:08.219
I think...
I think we're launching.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.321
Oh, my God, everyone
strap yourselves in.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.456
Stewie, hold my hand.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.158
No, thank you,
I prefer to die

13:13.160 --> 13:14.259
giving you the finger.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.362
If this is what it takes
to get out of Florida, fine.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.567
You know what,
you only live once.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.235
I am sticking my head
out the window.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.071
Yes, this is the best version

13:27.073 --> 13:29.374
of whatever's so enjoyable
about this.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.414
Mom, I'm scared.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.515
I don't believe it.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.783
Are we really
stuck in space?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.852
Oh, God, what if we
have to live up here

13:40.854 --> 13:42.520
for the rest
of our lives?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.922
I'm gonna miss
drinking at The Clam.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.323
I'll tell you what I won't miss.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.258
That waiter who thinks
he has to be funny.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.993
Yes, I'd like the
chopped salad, please,

13:48.995 --> 13:50.762
and could I get
no onions on that?

13:50.764 --> 13:53.865
Hmm, I've got a few connections
in the back.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.033
I'll see what I can do.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.167
Yeah, that's funny.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.802
If there's one onion
on that salad,

13:57.804 --> 14:00.605
you can forget the $1.80
tip you need to live.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.541
I'm sorry, you guys,
this is all my fault.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.844
I never should've brought you
on the space shuttle.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.146
You were right--
I am stupid.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.448
MAN (over radio):
Hello, up there.
Hello?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.851
I know you all must be pretty
terrified right now,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.185
but we're doing everything
in our power

14:14.187 --> 14:15.854
to get you safely back to earth.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.056
We're pretty good at this--
we're like six for eight.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.958
Is there anything
we can do?

14:19.960 --> 14:22.160
Well, fortunately
the ship runs on autopilot.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.162
We just need some time to figure
out your coordinates,

14:24.164 --> 14:25.897
and calculate the reentry plan.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.199
So, just try to stay calm
and we'll figure this all out.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.702
By the way,
you're all quite famous now.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.203
You're on every news channel.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.738
Good afternoon,
I'm Brian Williams.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.975
Our top story, an accidental
space shuttle launch

14:36.977 --> 14:39.410
that has sent a Rhode Island
family into orbit.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.813
For more on the story,
we go to our local affiliate

14:41.815 --> 14:44.182
Channel Five Quahog where
Tom Tucker is on the scene.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.183
Tom?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.417
Thanks, Brian.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.319
I, uh, saw that you opened
my birthday Evite.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.989
Now I just need you
to go ahead and reply.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.891
I'm standing here at the home
of the Griffin family,

14:52.893 --> 14:54.225
chatting with their neighbors.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.827
So, the Griffins
might be dead.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.061
How does that
make you feel?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.964
Griffin dead?
I take.

15:02.501 --> 15:03.935
No, no, they
might be dead.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.670
They also might
still be alive.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.705
It's okay, I-I take.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.774
(loud rumbling)

15:11.510 --> 15:13.111
(loud popping)

15:17.917 --> 15:19.717
Peter, what are you doing?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.286
I'm going out for
a space walk, Lois.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.887
You know, this
is our one chance

15:22.889 --> 15:25.056
to experience the
awe-inspiring wonders

15:25.058 --> 15:26.791
of space firsthand.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.964
Wow, neat.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.099
So, this is space.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.975
Damn it.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.246
(girl laughing)

15:48.248 --> 15:51.115
Ha! Stupid drunk bitches.

15:53.385 --> 15:54.552
Hey, Brian, check it out.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.287
Meg's poking
around the cargo hold.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.189
I'm gonna give her
a little scare.

15:59.491 --> 16:00.858
(screams)

16:08.734 --> 16:09.968
(sniffs)

16:09.970 --> 16:12.270
Aw, boy, I think
this space food has gone bad.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.972
Peter, that's a
fecal collection bag.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.273
Oh, there's a bag for that?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.008
'Cause mine's over there
twirling in the air

16:17.010 --> 16:18.443
like a slow baton.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.446
STEWIE:
Well, someone's got to lead
this marching band. Ew!

16:21.448 --> 16:22.747
MAN (over radio):
Griffins come in.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.415
Yes! Yes, we're here.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.117
Well, I have some good news.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.786
The autopilot is capable
of taking you home.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.854
But guys...
(static crackling)

16:29.856 --> 16:31.456
...to engage, we're gonna...

16:31.458 --> 16:32.924
...to take the shuttle out of...

16:32.926 --> 16:34.759
(radio goes silent)

16:34.761 --> 16:35.927
Hello?
(static drones)

16:35.929 --> 16:37.862
Hello?
Crap, I think we lost him.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.330
Let me fix that.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.100
If radio deejays have taught me
anything about radio,

16:42.102 --> 16:43.201
it's that you got
to do two things.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.503
Turn it up and rip the knob off.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.205
Peter, no!
(crackling)

16:47.207 --> 16:49.140
Damn it, now we've lost
communication entirely.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.375
What are we gonna do?

16:50.377 --> 16:51.876
I don't know,
but we got to try something.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.544
If we don't get this shuttle
out of orbit soon,

16:53.546 --> 16:55.346
we're gonna
run out of oxygen and die.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.547
Is failure an option?

16:56.549 --> 16:57.782
No, it's not.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.183
Aw, that was my suggestion.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.119
All right, come on, everyone,
we got to put our heads

17:01.121 --> 17:02.286
together
and try to find a solution.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.055
Don't worry-- Griffins
have a long history

17:04.057 --> 17:05.323
of figuring stuff out.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.691
Like my great-grandfather

17:06.693 --> 17:08.526
who invented the
first marital aid.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.297
This gives me an idea.

17:16.235 --> 17:17.735
She's dead.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.140
All right, come on,
if mission control thought

17:22.142 --> 17:23.307
we could help get the shuttle
out of orbit,

17:23.309 --> 17:24.575
it can't be that hard.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.044
Okay, okay,
uh, try this.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.412
Hit up, up, down, down,

17:27.414 --> 17:29.747
left, right, left, right,
B, A, start.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.082
Then we'll have
unlimited lives.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.850
Come on,
we're running out of time.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.986
Oh, Meg, all your suicide
threats over the years,

17:34.988 --> 17:37.755
and you're just as chicken
(bleep) as the rest of us.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.658
Hey, guys, I think I have
an idea that could help us.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.027
In Space Camp, we learned about
countering forward momentum

17:43.029 --> 17:44.829
with retro rockets.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.331
If we use them now,
the ship might slow down enough

17:47.333 --> 17:50.201
for gravity
to pull us out of orbit.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.071
PETER: That's an egg that I
hucked at you for being a nerd.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.141
Chris, if you think it'll help,
just try it!

18:01.013 --> 18:03.448
Ah, we're slowing down.
That's a good sign.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.450
You know, what's not slowing
down-- <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

18:05.452 --> 18:07.685
Haven't seen anything like it
since <i>The Wire.</i>

18:07.687 --> 18:09.754
God, he never shuts up
about those shows.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.888
Oh, my God!

18:10.890 --> 18:12.690
I think it might be working!

18:12.692 --> 18:14.058
(screaming)

18:14.060 --> 18:15.927
BRIAN:
We're spinning out!

18:18.630 --> 18:20.131
MEG:
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

18:20.133 --> 18:21.966
There's so many things
I didn't do.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.534
I never got to go to college!

18:23.536 --> 18:26.204
My book wasn't all
I wanted it to be in spots!

18:26.206 --> 18:28.239
Peter, I wanted to
grow old with you!

18:28.241 --> 18:29.941
Well, you kind of did.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.043
I never got to wear it better!

18:35.714 --> 18:38.716
(grunts)
I have to reorient
the retro rockets

18:38.718 --> 18:41.018
to counter the spin rotation!

18:42.788 --> 18:44.222
(grunts)

19:01.140 --> 19:02.406
Chris, what are you doing?

19:02.408 --> 19:04.242
(dramatically):
Saving our lives.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.810
Aw, I wish he
hadn't said that.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.512
Now I'm kind of
rooting against him.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.017
We're straightening out!

19:14.319 --> 19:16.287
Ah, look! It says
"autopilot engaged."

19:16.289 --> 19:18.923
Good for him.
I'm glad he found someone.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.658
Oh, thank God,
we're saved!

19:20.660 --> 19:24.295
I can't believe I got to go
to space before Derek Watson.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.530
Who's Derek Watson?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.265
Nobody now.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.515
They've re-entered
the atmosphere!

19:44.517 --> 19:47.218
(cheering)

19:47.220 --> 19:49.754
I'm not cheering.
I don't even know them.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.864
(tires screech)

19:59.866 --> 20:02.967
(cheering)

20:11.743 --> 20:14.412
(cheering,
camera shutter clicking)

20:16.515 --> 20:18.549
Well, thanks to
no gravity in space,

20:18.551 --> 20:21.652
my spine stretched and I am
now a confident six, three,

20:21.654 --> 20:24.689
so, Lois, I will be leaving you
for a hotter woman.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.425
Never mind, Lois,
I love you so much.

20:30.996 --> 20:34.065
Chris, our family is alive
right now because of you.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.099
You saved us.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.367
That's right, buddy.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.402
It was your brains
that pulled us through.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.871
We're so sorry
we ever doubted you.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.173
Thanks, you guys.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.341
You bet, champ.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.443
Hey, by the way,
who moved our house?
