02:37.069 --> 02:39.289
Did you eat the
last cream-filled?

02:39.376 --> 02:42.162
- Yeah, I left you a glazed one.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.085
- I don't know how you
can eat those things

02:53.173 --> 02:54.957
every day like that.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.524
They don't even seem
to do anything to you.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.613
- Yeah, I guess I'm
just blessed like that.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.396
- I guess.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.055
- Hey, you see this?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.752
- See what?

03:07.839 --> 03:10.799
- That Cincinnati baseball
team made the front page again.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.409
This player right here?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.324
He's gonna be in the Hall of
Fame before it's all over.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.717
You mark my words.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.632
- Oh, yeah, no,
he's a great player.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.744
- Ike!

03:45.529 --> 03:49.577
You need to come in here
and take a look at this.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.366
Got a new APB today.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.239
Looks like he resurfaced.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.633
I tell you, this
guy is bad news.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.245
Seems like every time
something crazy goes down,

04:05.332 --> 04:09.205
somebody has a description
that fits this clown.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.902
Now, today we have a sketch,

04:10.989 --> 04:14.384
but all we know is that he
goes by the name of Luc.

04:14.471 --> 04:18.083
- Yeah, he is a
shady-lookin' character.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.911
- To say the least.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.618
[rain splashes]

04:34.752 --> 04:36.188
The guy came outta nowhere,
I don't know about--

04:36.276 --> 04:38.452
[knocks]

04:38.539 --> 04:40.062
- Who's that?

04:40.149 --> 04:43.283
- I don't know, but
the door's unlocked.

05:03.172 --> 05:08.133
[rain splashes]
[suspenseful music]

05:23.148 --> 05:24.193
- Gabe!

05:25.934 --> 05:27.283
Gabe, it's a baby.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.446
[dark orchestral music]

06:12.415 --> 06:14.983
[rain splashes]

06:25.515 --> 06:28.126
- I'll wager I save that soul.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.615
- [Ike] What was that?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.182
- Nothing.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.531
Nothing at all.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.326
So, what're you gonna do?

06:55.545 --> 06:57.242
- What am I gonna do?

06:58.940 --> 07:01.551
- [Gabe] What're you gonna do?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.031
- What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

07:03.118 --> 07:05.076
[Gabe chuckles]

07:05.163 --> 07:08.036
- Don't stress it, kid, I'm
gonna walk you through it.

07:08.123 --> 07:12.257
The first thing you're gonna
do is contact Children Services

07:12.344 --> 07:13.563
and I wouldn't waste any time,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.304
'cause it's gettin'
a little late.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.567
Unless you don't mind
babysitting all night?

07:17.654 --> 07:18.873
[chuckles]

07:18.960 --> 07:20.744
It's a tough break, kid.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.267
And you know, since
you found the baby,

07:22.354 --> 07:24.269
you have to do the report, too.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.836
[Ike sighs]

07:25.923 --> 07:27.708
- [chuckles] Look, I
gotta break you in right.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.232
One day, you're gonna
be running this place.

07:30.319 --> 07:33.365
- Yeah, how do you know that?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.454
- I know stuff.

07:41.112 --> 07:44.246
- Hi, this is the 32nd Precinct.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.116
We, uh...

07:47.205 --> 07:48.729
We have an abandoned baby.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.339
[somber orchestral music]

07:50.426 --> 07:54.343
Yes, he was left on the
front steps of the station.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.215
Yeah, in the rain.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.045
Okay.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.486
All right.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.400
Thank you very much.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.319
- So, how long, Ike?

08:17.148 --> 08:20.151
- Well, that was the
case worker on call.

08:20.238 --> 08:23.503
It's gonna be at
least an hour or two.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
With it being so
late, they don't know

08:25.592 --> 08:29.857
if they're gonna have a
home for him tonight or not.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.772
How does someone do that?

08:33.251 --> 08:36.124
How can you do that
to your own kid?

08:37.952 --> 08:40.389
- There are plenty of reasons.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.348
None of them right, though.

08:43.435 --> 08:47.135
I mean, they might be devoid
of moral foundation or,

08:47.222 --> 08:51.792
down and out, strung out, drug
addict, you get the picture.

08:51.879 --> 08:56.100
Whatever their frame of
mind, man, it's always sad.

08:57.972 --> 09:01.366
But you are going
to be all right.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.891
Yes, you are. [giggles]

09:03.978 --> 09:06.284
Yes, you are, you gonna be
all right, yes, you are.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.765
[chuckles]

09:08.852 --> 09:10.680
Hold on, man, what's this?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.247
- [Ike] What is it?

09:12.334 --> 09:15.163
- Baby has a tag
tied to his wrist.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.514
- [Ike] What's it say?

09:20.081 --> 09:21.561
- It says Brucie.

09:23.432 --> 09:27.697
His name is Bruce. [laughs]

09:27.784 --> 09:30.352
[laughs]

09:30.439 --> 09:32.572
You gonna be just fine.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.534
[rain splashes]

09:43.626 --> 09:46.411
- [sighs] I mean, is
she coming or not?

09:46.498 --> 09:47.325
It's been a while.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.589
- Calm down, Ike.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.678
These things take
time, she'll be here.

09:51.765 --> 09:55.812
- I know, but we're not,
we're not equipped to...

09:55.899 --> 09:57.248
[Gabe chuckles]

09:57.335 --> 10:00.034
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

10:00.121 --> 10:00.991
But everything's
gonna be all right,

10:01.078 --> 10:02.819
now that you found the lad.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.212
Now, if you hadn't
had found him,

10:04.299 --> 10:05.735
that would've been
a different story.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.563
He could've been out
there, laying around,

10:07.650 --> 10:09.913
hour after hour in the cold
rain and then hypothermia sets--

10:10.000 --> 10:13.569
- I don't even wanna
think about that.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.485
I mean, Gabe, you
know how I feel.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.486
You know.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.574
- Hey, I do.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.666
I know you were raised...

10:23.753 --> 10:27.104
Look, at least you were adopted.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.498
Think of it this way, at
least we heard the knock

10:29.585 --> 10:33.067
at the door and you found
him the way that you did.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.548
- You know, that,
that could've been me.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.377
I mean, that was me, really.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.423
- It's not you, kid.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.817
You did good, look at you.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.036
It's gonna be all
right with him, too.

10:46.123 --> 10:49.649
You may wanna put him
on your prayer list.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.609
- Yeah.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.525
Of course I will.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.619
[rain splashes]

11:07.318 --> 11:10.582
[melancholy piano music]

11:17.154 --> 11:18.590
Hi.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.157
I'm so glad you're here.

11:20.244 --> 11:24.422
I'm Ike Ramsey, that's
Chief Angelus down the hall.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.905
- So, this is the little guy.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.647
Someone actually left him
here at the precinct, huh?

11:31.734 --> 11:32.517
- Yeah.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.696
[sighs] His name's Brucie.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.481
There's a tag tied
around his wrist.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.743
- So they did.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.487
Well, Little Brucie,
let's get you out of here.

11:45.574 --> 11:50.274
- What's, uh, I'm sorry, what's
going to happen to him?

11:50.361 --> 11:51.928
- Foster care's
already lined up.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.843
I have preliminary
supplies with me.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.410
I'll be dropping
him off tonight.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.151
- So, he's gonna a foster home?

11:57.238 --> 11:58.587
- Yes.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.589
In fact, they're
waiting on him now.

12:00.676 --> 12:05.289
Oh, by the way, I'll need a
copy of the report tomorrow.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.377
- Of course.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.641
But, uh, before you go.

12:23.655 --> 12:28.269
This was given to me on the
day I was adopted by my mom.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.577
It says, "I will
always watch over you,"

12:32.664 --> 12:34.666
and it has my name, Ike.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.888
I guess it kinda reads like,

12:38.975 --> 12:42.936
"I'll be the one
watching over you now."

12:43.023 --> 12:45.721
I hope that's what
my prayers do.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.595
It's yours now.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.511
Good luck.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.126
[door creaks]

13:18.754 --> 13:19.755
Hey.

13:19.842 --> 13:20.800
- [Wife] Hi.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.237
- It smells good.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.152
- It's almost finished.

13:28.764 --> 13:29.547
- Thanks.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.839
- How was your night?

14:01.753 --> 14:03.886
[Ike sighs]

14:08.499 --> 14:09.109
Ike?

14:10.632 --> 14:13.809
- Someone left a
baby at the precinct.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.203
- A baby?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.817
- I was the one who found him.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.648
[somber orchestral music]

14:26.735 --> 14:28.911
- Are you all right?

14:28.998 --> 14:30.608
- Yeah, it just...

14:32.784 --> 14:35.526
Just brought a lot
back, you know?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.704
Just stuff I kinda buried.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.533
- Yeah.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.454
I remember you talking
about some of those things.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.893
- His name was Bruce.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.635
They left a name tag
tied around his wrist.

15:00.812 --> 15:01.726
I just hate to think
about him having

15:01.813 --> 15:04.251
to go through the same thing.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.519
- And they just left
him on the steps?

15:11.606 --> 15:12.389
- Yeah.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.175
[sighs]

15:15.262 --> 15:19.092
They didn't even hang around
to see if we'd find him.

15:21.790 --> 15:26.577
- I can't even imagine what
was going through your head.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.756
- I didn't know what to think.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.280
Even Gabe was shaken up,

15:33.367 --> 15:36.936
and he doesn't get
excited about anything.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.292
- Are you done?

15:47.468 --> 15:49.600
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I just...

15:51.080 --> 15:51.994
Guess I don't really
have much of an appetite.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.039
- It's okay.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.295
- Hey, buddy.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.821
How's my little man?

16:42.784 --> 16:43.698
[sighs]

16:43.785 --> 16:44.568
Lord.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.137
Please watch over my son.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.708
Steer him clear of things
that may cause pain,

16:53.795 --> 16:55.666
or misfortune or death.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.757
Please keep him in your
grace should he stray.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.108
Please help lead
him back to you.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.503
And please watch
over on Brucie, too.

17:08.201 --> 17:11.334
Let him find a home
and love and care.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.164
Amen.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.053
- He's so peaceful.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.752
- Yeah, he is.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.498
Oh, God, what a night.

17:44.585 --> 17:45.368
- Yeah.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.025
Let's not think
about that for a bit.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.287
- Yeah.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.114
Okay.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.078
[birds tweet]

18:05.867 --> 18:08.261
- [Boy] Dagnabit
Brucie, you won again.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.349
- Who's next?

18:09.436 --> 18:11.002
- [Boy] I am.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.526
- [Brucie] Bring it.

18:12.613 --> 18:17.052
- Oh, trust me. I am.

[coin clinks]

18:19.054 --> 18:20.838
[footsteps clack]

18:20.925 --> 18:21.926
- I got this one.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.364
- I beat you last week.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.017
I'll be spending your
lunch money this week.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.933
- [Boy] In your dreams.

18:29.020 --> 18:29.804
- Yeah.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.025
[footsteps clack]

18:34.113 --> 18:35.244
- I got next.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.289
- All right.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.771
[coins clink]

18:40.858 --> 18:43.034
- All right, what is this?

18:47.474 --> 18:48.997
Should've known it was you.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.868
- I wasn't the only
one, did you see them?

18:50.955 --> 18:54.045
- No, no, you weren't, but
since you like betting so much,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.786
I bet you're the ringleader.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.179
Now, get to class!

19:05.709 --> 19:07.537
- Do you know what we're
doing in science today?

19:07.624 --> 19:08.930
- I have no clue.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.714
I guess we'll find out soon.

19:10.801 --> 19:11.933
- Yeah, I guess so.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.631
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Bye.

19:16.981 --> 19:17.895
- Hey, Brucie.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.636
- Oh, hey, Suzy, what's up?

19:19.723 --> 19:20.637
- What's up with you?

19:20.724 --> 19:22.030
I haven't seen you all summer.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.684
- Well, you know,
little bit of this

19:23.771 --> 19:24.989
and a little bit of that.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.948
- Yep, so, up to no good then?

19:27.035 --> 19:29.080
- Aw, come on,
Suzy, you know me.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.908
I ain't no trouble.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.607
That is, as long as
I don't get caught.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.913
- Yeah, that's
exactly what I mean.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.045
You're such a cut-up.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.438
You need to stop, you know?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.614
You don't have to act like that.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.878
Why don't you let other people
see you the way I see you?

19:43.965 --> 19:45.009
- Yeah, right.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.055
You know I can't do that.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.709
- Yes, you can.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.190
I know I believe in you.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.367
I know you have your
troubles, but I know you.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.369
- No, you don't.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.588
That's just how
I act around you.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.200
I don't, I don't think you know.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.072
- Just stop!

20:04.159 --> 20:06.074
I know what you're trying to do.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.641
You're just trying
to make excuses

20:07.728 --> 20:11.079
instead of accepting yourself
for who you really are,

20:11.166 --> 20:12.907
and you know where that starts.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.865
- Yeah, yeah, I know what
you're trying to say.

20:14.952 --> 20:18.129
It starts with me going
to church with you.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.131
- Yeah, I know you've
heard it before,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.133
but you need to hear it again.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.223
You need to know it's the truth.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.529
- Look, I told you
before, I'll go.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.270
I just don't know when.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.706
- Yeah.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.142
Heard that before.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.232
- I know.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.106
- Well, you need to decide
when and let me know.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.194
[bell rings]

20:39.281 --> 20:40.804
Well, saved by the bell.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.153
We gotta hurry.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.300
[locker clangs]

21:07.701 --> 21:11.357
- Lisa, can you lead
the Pledge for us today?

21:15.535 --> 21:17.101
- I pledge allegiance--

21:17.188 --> 21:20.235
- [Class] To the flag of the
United States of America,

21:20.322 --> 21:23.194
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

21:23.282 --> 21:25.109
one nation, under God,

21:25.196 --> 21:28.852
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

21:28.939 --> 21:29.940
- Thank you.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.292
Brucie?

21:35.163 --> 21:36.033
Lunch money then.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.383
Thank you.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.601
- [Principal] Good
morning, Lincoln Valley

21:38.688 --> 21:40.124
Middle School students.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.953
This is Mrs. Moore with
the morning announcements.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.955
The PTA meeting is this week,

21:45.042 --> 21:46.870
so your teacher
will be sending home

21:46.957 --> 21:49.264
a reminder for your parents.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.658
Remember, this Friday
is the Sweetheart Dance

21:51.745 --> 21:53.486
at seven o'clock.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.053
Gentlemen, you must
wear a shirt and tie,

21:56.140 --> 21:59.361
and young ladies, you must
wear a dress or a skirt.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.798
Please, no sneakers
or blue jeans.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.499
For today's lunch, we're
having hamburger, french fries,

22:06.586 --> 22:09.763
pears, and a
chocolate chip cookie.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.330
Have a great day.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.336
- Cafeteria, please.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.342
[suspenseful music]

22:27.258 --> 22:29.304
Brucie, what are you doing?

22:31.262 --> 22:32.351
Brucie, stop!

22:41.316 --> 22:42.448
Suzy, come here!

22:47.322 --> 22:49.890
Take this to the office, please.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.416
You wait right here, young man,

22:54.503 --> 22:58.246
till I decide what I'm
going to do with you.

23:52.256 --> 23:55.738
[playful orchestral music]

24:00.917 --> 24:03.398
[class laughs]

24:16.193 --> 24:18.021
[class laughs]

24:18.108 --> 24:20.154
What are you laughing at?

24:29.032 --> 24:31.600
[Brucie chuckles]

24:33.384 --> 24:35.212
- No, no, no, no, you are not
touching me with that thing.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.432
- What did you think was
going to happen, Brucie?

24:37.519 --> 24:38.868
First, the incident
from earlier.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.088
Now, you insist on
disturbing the class.

24:41.175 --> 24:44.004
I have tried and tried,
but you won't listen.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.527
Now turn around and put
your hands on the wall.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.486
- No, no, you can't make me!

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
- Let's go to the office.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.143
- This isn't fair.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.539
- [Suzy] Boy, you
really did it today.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.410
- [Brucie] Did what?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.369
- [Suzy] Got caught.

25:01.456 --> 25:04.372
I don't know about
you sometimes.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.505
- [Brucie] You don't
need to rub it in.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.637
- [Suzy] So what're
you gonna do?

25:08.724 --> 25:11.031
- [Brucie] I'm gonna
become president.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.075
[Suzy chuckles]

25:12.162 --> 25:13.729
- [Suzy] No, silly.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.252
That's not what I meant.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.341
But you could, you know.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.865
You could, if you really wanted.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.520
I mean, you would
have to work at it.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.826
My parents told me
you can do anything,

25:23.913 --> 25:27.830
if you put your mind to it,
and you're no different.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.833
- [Brucie] Well, I
don't know about that.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.880
Pat, my foster mom for a
couple of years said that

25:33.967 --> 25:36.796
everyone has a different
purpose and a different path,

25:36.883 --> 25:38.798
and everyone has
different genes.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.627
The necessary genes to do
what they're destined to do.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.543
- [Suzy] Wow, I never
thought about it like that.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.023
- [Brucie] Well, it makes sense.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.677
If someone's no good at math,

25:48.764 --> 25:51.593
it isn't likely that they'll
grow up to be an accountant,

25:51.680 --> 25:54.553
but everyone has to learn
what they're equipped to do

25:54.640 --> 25:58.426
or what they can do and that's
what they can grow up to be.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.559
- [Suzy] See, you
are smart, Brucie.

26:00.646 --> 26:04.519
So, what is it you think
can do or wanna be?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.304
- [Brucie] I told you
already, president.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.568
- [Suzy] [chuckles] Boy.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.744
You must really think
you have some good genes.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.747
- Yeah, I do have
some good jeans.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.663
That has to be the least
funny joke I've ever...

26:17.750 --> 26:19.229
[Suzy chuckles]

26:19.316 --> 26:21.014
- [Suzy] I'm still holding
you to your promise.

26:21.101 --> 26:23.538
- Promise, what promise?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.366
- [Suzy] Yeah, I wonder.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.021
You know exactly what
promise I'm talking about.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.675
Why don't you go to
church with me on Sunday?

26:29.762 --> 26:30.980
- Fine, I'll go.

26:31.067 --> 26:31.894
- [Suzy] Really?

26:31.981 --> 26:33.722
I'm holding you to it.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.029
- [Brucie] See ya.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.204
- [Suzy] Bye.

26:38.466 --> 26:42.470
[melancholy orchestral music]

27:01.620 --> 27:03.622
- Tiberius, that's
him, right over there.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.493
- Man, touch me again!

27:07.321 --> 27:08.104
Anyway.

27:10.150 --> 27:13.283
So that's the one
you picked out, huh?

27:13.370 --> 27:15.024
- We've been watching
him for a while.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.591
We think he's a good fit.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.159
- All right, same
background as the others?

27:19.246 --> 27:20.856
- Oh, yeah.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.467
He's been in and out of more
foster homes than I can count.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.819
- Yeah, but that don't
necessarily mean nothin'.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.125
In and out a few you say, huh?

27:29.212 --> 27:30.692
- Quite a few.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.434
- Yeah, that's what's up.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.870
There ain't gonna
be no man hunt,

27:34.957 --> 27:37.481
'cause ain't nobody
gonna even miss him.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.179
Yeah.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.964
We still need somebody to cut
and run the product, though.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.574
But him?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.577
Yeah, he gonna
work out just fine.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.015
All right, make it happen.

27:49.102 --> 27:49.842
- You bet.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.410
[car starts]

27:57.719 --> 27:59.765
- Suzy, how are you today?
- I'm fine, thank you.

27:59.852 --> 28:00.548
Hi.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.425
You made it.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.601
- Well, I said I
would, didn't I?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.473
- Yeah, I know you did.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.344
Well, we have a few
minutes before we start

28:14.431 --> 28:15.694
and I wanted to show you around.

28:15.781 --> 28:16.869
- I'm good with that.

28:16.956 --> 28:17.696
- Cool.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.659
[peaceful piano music]

28:24.746 --> 28:25.791
- Hi, Suzy.
- Hi.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.009
- How are you? Good to see you.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.837
- I'm good.
- Excellent, who's this?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.534
- This is Brucie, he
goes to school with me.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.928
- Hi, welcome, glad to
have you here today.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.191
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.413
Okay, guys, today
we're gonna start off

28:39.500 --> 28:41.676
with just a short lesson.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.547
From there we're gonna move
into the trivia contest

28:43.634 --> 28:45.549
that we talked about last week.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.508
You'll catch up, don't worry.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.119
Who remembers what we
were talking about?

28:50.206 --> 28:51.425
Jimmy?

28:51.512 --> 28:52.905
- David and Goliath.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.863
- David, that's
excellent, very good.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.779
So if you remember,
David's father Jesse

28:57.866 --> 29:00.651
sent him to be with his brothers

29:00.739 --> 29:04.351
who were preparing to do
battle with the Philistines.

29:04.438 --> 29:07.441
Anybody remember what
he took with him?

29:07.528 --> 29:08.659
Suzy?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.226
- Bread and cheese.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.619
- Yes, that's it.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.969
So when David got there,

29:14.056 --> 29:18.191
Goliath came out and
challenged David's people.

29:18.278 --> 29:22.673
And David, who was but a
youth, a young boy, he said--

29:22.761 --> 29:25.154
- [Man] The President of the
United States of America!

29:25.241 --> 29:27.635
[audience applauds]

29:27.722 --> 29:30.464
- I would like to welcome
everyone who came out today,

29:30.551 --> 29:33.684
and those of you who are
watching by television.

29:33.772 --> 29:37.732
I wish to extend my
heartfelt thanks to everyone

29:37.819 --> 29:40.430
who has supported us in
the midst of what you know

29:40.517 --> 29:44.565
is a heated campaign, which
is ultimately why we won

29:44.652 --> 29:47.786
the election is
because of your vote.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.614
Now, you know it has been
our promise all along

29:50.701 --> 29:53.748
that the great country that
we live in shall realize

29:53.835 --> 29:56.577
its full potential,
but in order to do that

29:56.664 --> 29:58.797
we must empower the people.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.061
Now, homelessness
and unemployment

30:02.148 --> 30:04.324
shall be a thing of the past

30:04.411 --> 30:08.589
and division in the workplace
shall be nonexistent.

30:08.676 --> 30:12.419
[audience applauds]

30:12.506 --> 30:16.945
- It took Goliath's own sword
and he takes the victory.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.730
Okay, well that's it.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.385
Time for church, you
guys have a great day.

30:22.472 --> 30:23.822
[solemn organ music]

30:23.909 --> 30:25.214
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.173
- Thank you for coming.

30:53.503 --> 30:58.378
- Trust is the cornerstone of
every successful relationship.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.772
Proverbs chapter three
verses five and six say,

31:01.860 --> 31:05.080
"Trust in the Lord
with all thine heart.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.301
"Lean not unto thine
own understanding.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.956
"In all thy ways,
acknowledge him

31:11.043 --> 31:14.263
"and he will direct thy paths."

31:14.350 --> 31:18.267
It is our great hope that
God is who he says he is.

31:19.965 --> 31:23.838
We often hold fast to this
hope when we're anticipating

31:23.925 --> 31:28.277
the life to come, but we
also hold fast to this hope

31:29.800 --> 31:30.714
when we're talking
about things that deal

31:30.801 --> 31:32.586
with this life as well.

31:34.022 --> 31:37.808
In this life, we
have the same hope,

31:37.896 --> 31:40.811
that God is exactly
who he says he is.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.860
We often put our hope and trust
in God with the anticipation

31:45.947 --> 31:47.862
that he won't fail us.

31:48.950 --> 31:52.258
When we fail, we cry out for him

31:52.345 --> 31:54.825
because we have hope
that he will hear,

31:54.913 --> 31:57.828
that he will answer,
that he will rescue,

31:57.916 --> 31:59.787
that he will provide.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.310
Why do we call on God?

32:02.790 --> 32:05.967
Because we know he
is always faithful.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.710
We know that our
God is trustworthy.

32:09.797 --> 32:14.541
We know that we can trust him
because he will not betray us,

32:14.628 --> 32:18.719
he will not lie to us,
he will not leave us,

32:18.806 --> 32:20.982
and he will not forsake us,

32:21.069 --> 32:24.507
and we know that
he never changes.

32:24.594 --> 32:28.816
We all have that friend
that we know is trustworthy.

32:28.903 --> 32:33.255
And we know that if we go to
them, will be there for us.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.823
If we need something,
they'll help us.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.869
They won't betray us,
they won't lie to us.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.743
These are the attributes
that we expect from God

32:42.830 --> 32:45.398
and depend on from God.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.357
But the question I
wanna ask you today is,

32:48.444 --> 32:51.926
what does God say
when he sees you?

32:52.013 --> 32:56.844
How do you become a person
that is absolutely trustworthy

32:57.801 --> 32:59.194
and reliable, dependable?

33:00.761 --> 33:05.113
How do you get to be a
person that God can trust?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.985
It takes a step of faith,

33:08.464 --> 33:12.207
and in a moment, I'm
going to open this altar

33:12.294 --> 33:16.385
to everyone who would like
to put your faith and trust

33:16.472 --> 33:19.040
in Jesus Christ as savior,

33:19.127 --> 33:21.434
not just for this lifetime,

33:22.391 --> 33:24.132
but for eternity.

33:24.219 --> 33:28.876
I'm going to invite everyone
here in this congregation

33:28.963 --> 33:31.618
that would like to receive
Jesus as their savior

33:31.705 --> 33:33.620
to make your way to this altar.

33:33.707 --> 33:37.972
We'll pray, God will
hear, God will answer,

33:38.059 --> 33:40.844
and your life will be changed.

33:40.931 --> 33:43.586
- Wanna go down, Brucie?

33:43.673 --> 33:45.501
- I don't know,
people are watching.

33:45.588 --> 33:49.070
- Since when do you care
what other people think?

33:49.157 --> 33:50.463
- I don't know.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.815
- I can tell you want to,
come on, I'll go with you.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.121
[Brucie sighs]

33:56.208 --> 33:56.947
- Okay.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.837
- [Pastor] God, I come to you,
a sinner in need of a savior.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.448
I believe Jesus
is the son of God

34:19.535 --> 34:22.756
and died on the cross for
the forgiveness of sins.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.498
I've committed sins and
I ask your forgiveness.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.979
I declare and decree
that I will live for you

34:29.067 --> 34:30.198
as you show me how.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.418
In Jesus' name, I pray.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.201
Amen.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.115
- Hey, kid!

34:35.377 --> 34:37.684
Can you tell me how to get to

34:37.771 --> 34:41.035
Herb's garage on
Livingston, I think?

34:41.122 --> 34:43.820
- Yeah, sure, that's easy,
you've just gotta head down--

34:43.907 --> 34:45.561
- Get in.

34:45.648 --> 34:46.432
Now.

34:50.523 --> 34:51.915
- Get in the car, man.

34:52.002 --> 34:54.048
You heard him, get in.

35:15.025 --> 35:18.377
[somber orchestral music]

36:09.776 --> 36:12.561
Man, Ti, we pulled that off
like a boss, baby, we pulled--

36:12.648 --> 36:14.607
- Man, get him put away.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.393
- Come on, young Bruce.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.787
Hey, we're your family now.

36:26.445 --> 36:27.881
All right, check it out.

36:27.968 --> 36:31.493
This was your predecessor's,
now it's all yours.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.342
[ball thuds]

37:27.680 --> 37:30.160
- We'd like to file a
missing persons report.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.205
- Of course.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.554
Please, sit down.

37:38.299 --> 37:38.952
I know you.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.782
Yeah, I remember you from
the night we found Brucie.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.175
The baby we found on the steps.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.221
- Yeah, believe me, I remember.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.658
I've dealt with Brucie on
and off over the years.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.574
He's been in about 17
foster homes. [chuckles]

37:52.661 --> 37:54.576
I believe that may be a record.

37:54.663 --> 37:56.622
In fact, that's why we're here.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.058
He's the one that's missing.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.800
- Oh, no, you're kidding.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.150
I hate to hear that.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.499
You know, I've been hoping
and praying things would've

38:04.586 --> 38:06.632
turned out differently for him.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.460
- No, unfortunately not.

38:08.547 --> 38:12.159
In fact, we don't know where
he is, if he's run off or what.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.204
Either way, we have
to assume the worst,

38:14.292 --> 38:16.163
and that's why we're here.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.556
- Of course.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
- Is Chief Angelus still here?

38:19.427 --> 38:21.342
- [chuckles] Oh, Gabe?

38:21.429 --> 38:23.301
No, he's been gone
for some time.

38:23.388 --> 38:27.653
No, he left for some kind
of special assignment.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.220
I have no idea what
that was about, but uh,

38:30.308 --> 38:33.441
he acted like it was some
kind of top secret thing.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.356
Haven't seen him since.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.926
So, Brucie, when
was he last seen?

38:40.013 --> 38:42.537
- This morning, when
he left for church.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.060
- He's been missing
since this morning,

38:44.147 --> 38:45.758
and you're just now reporting?

38:45.845 --> 38:47.977
- Well, you need to know Brucie.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.502
He, uh, isn't one to
come straight home,

38:50.589 --> 38:54.070
and, well, for all it takes
to get him to stay there,

38:54.157 --> 38:55.550
he's always on the go.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.641
- So does he just kind
of do as he pleases?

38:59.728 --> 39:02.992
- No, no, we let
him have freedoms.

39:03.079 --> 39:05.560
He's 14, [chuckles] and he
can go visit his friends,

39:05.647 --> 39:10.173
and as long as he checks in
before supper and is home...

39:13.873 --> 39:16.528
So when he didn't
check in after church,

39:16.615 --> 39:18.965
we called our caseworker
and she suggested waiting

39:19.052 --> 39:21.663
to see if he came home
for supper, but he didn't.

39:21.750 --> 39:26.494
So, I called her back and I
just knew something is wrong.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.018
- Who was he last seen with?

39:29.105 --> 39:31.107
- Suzy, he went to
church with her.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.327
It's a girl he goes
to school with.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.111
- Does he go to church often?

39:35.198 --> 39:37.505
- No, this was his first time.

39:39.289 --> 39:43.206
Suzy had been asking him for
a long time to go to church.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.470
He was just so happy and
he was nice this morning,

39:45.557 --> 39:47.341
and it doesn't make
sense, you know?

39:47.428 --> 39:49.865
Suzy brings out the best in him.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.390
- Do you know how I
can get a hold of Suzy?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.914
- Yes, Brucie had her number
written down and I already

39:55.001 --> 39:57.307
called her house and talked
to her parents today.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.354
They asked Suzy if she knew
where Brucie was, but um,

40:00.441 --> 40:03.313
she last seen him
leaving church.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.316
- You don't have that
number on you, do you?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.405
- Yes, I do.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.062
- Great, thank you.

40:14.803 --> 40:15.630
So, Brucie.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.416
Was he given a last name?

40:18.503 --> 40:21.114
- Yes, the state gave
him the name Bruce Stern.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.811
[chuckles] Kind of appropriate.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.247
- Hmm.

40:24.334 --> 40:24.857
I suppose.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.165
It could be assumed that
he's been through a lot.

40:29.252 --> 40:30.515
You know, it's hard on a kid,

40:30.602 --> 40:32.473
being moved from one
environment to another,

40:32.560 --> 40:35.345
from one influence to another,

40:35.433 --> 40:39.349
and it's not always
the best influence.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.047
Do you have a recent photo?

40:41.134 --> 40:41.874
- Yes.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.443
Here you go.

40:47.967 --> 40:51.449
- Well, I'll put out
an all points bulletin.

40:51.536 --> 40:55.061
If he shows up or if
you hear anything,

40:55.148 --> 40:56.715
contact me immediately.

40:56.802 --> 40:57.977
- Will do.

40:58.064 --> 40:58.891
- Yes, sir.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.279
[muffled chatter]

41:39.366 --> 41:40.889
[ping pong ball clacks]

41:40.976 --> 41:42.064
[claps]

41:42.151 --> 41:43.979
- All right, listen up!

41:44.980 --> 41:46.678
- Anybody seen Reggie?

41:49.898 --> 41:52.727
Oh, so ain't nobody seen him?

41:52.814 --> 41:57.645
Well, look, if y'all see
Reggie, tell him to come see me.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.038
Y'all got that?

42:00.518 --> 42:01.519
Good.

42:15.054 --> 42:18.579
- [Man With Hat] Hey,
let's go, young Bruce.

42:24.237 --> 42:28.328
- Where are we going?
- We've got some work to do.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.683
[dark orchestral music]

42:51.525 --> 42:53.222
- All right, little Brucie.

42:53.309 --> 42:55.964
Shut up, do exactly
what I tell you,

42:56.051 --> 42:58.271
and you might not get hurt.

42:58.358 --> 42:59.794
Now, you're gonna
get out the car,

42:59.881 --> 43:02.188
and walk over to that
corner over there.

43:02.275 --> 43:04.582
A guy gonna come over
to you and he gonna say,

43:04.669 --> 43:06.845
"Look like a nice night."

43:06.932 --> 43:10.718
You gonna say, "No,
it look like snow."

43:10.805 --> 43:15.288
He gonna hand you a package
and you gonna hand him this,

43:15.375 --> 43:17.899
and then you gonna walk
back over to the car.

43:17.986 --> 43:19.292
That's it.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.249
You got it?

43:21.381 --> 43:22.382
- Yeah, I think so.

43:22.469 --> 43:24.776
- Man, do you or don't you?

43:24.863 --> 43:27.517
- Bruce, you have to be sure.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.519
You can't mess this up.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.914
Remember, "No, it
looks like snow."

43:33.001 --> 43:33.523
It rhymes.

43:35.047 --> 43:38.964
- Man, get him out of my
car and put him to work.

43:40.792 --> 43:44.360
- Hey, remember, "No,
it looks like snow."

43:48.408 --> 43:50.845
[door squeaks]

44:12.345 --> 44:14.608
- It looks like a nice night.

44:43.855 --> 44:46.509
- [Tiberius] Man, don't give
it to me, give it to him!

44:46.596 --> 44:47.946
- Good job, Bruce.

44:49.382 --> 44:50.688
Oh, yeah, we good.

44:53.429 --> 44:54.213
Good job.

45:46.221 --> 45:49.181
[suspenseful music]

46:38.926 --> 46:42.016
[Ike sighs]

46:42.103 --> 46:43.061
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:46.847 --> 46:49.676
- Do you want something to
eat before we go to bed?

46:49.763 --> 46:51.330
- No, no, thank you.

46:53.462 --> 46:56.901
- Okay, well, um, if you
don't want something to eat,

46:56.988 --> 46:59.642
we should probably
gets some sleep.

46:59.729 --> 47:02.080
We've got Taylor's game
later today, remember?

47:02.167 --> 47:03.211
- I remember.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.171
Hey, um...

47:08.782 --> 47:11.437
Do you remember
about 14 years ago

47:11.524 --> 47:14.919
when I found the baby
outside the precinct?

47:15.789 --> 47:16.224
- Yeah.

47:17.791 --> 47:21.142
Yeah, um, what was his
name, it was, uh...

47:23.318 --> 47:24.406
Bruce?

47:24.493 --> 47:25.843
- Yeah, it was Bruce.

47:25.930 --> 47:26.713
- Bruce.

47:28.193 --> 47:31.718
Well, he's resurfaced.
[melancholy piano music]

47:31.805 --> 47:32.850
- Resurfaced?

47:34.721 --> 47:36.636
- Yeah, the same
caseworker came in tonight

47:36.723 --> 47:41.119
with a foster mom to file
a missing persons report,

47:41.206 --> 47:42.468
and it's Bruce.

47:46.037 --> 47:47.212
- Oh, my gosh.

47:48.953 --> 47:50.563
- Yeah, apparently
he's been in and out

47:50.650 --> 47:52.870
of 17 different foster homes.

47:54.132 --> 47:55.698
Some kind of record.

47:59.093 --> 48:01.922
So, I guess he's a
bit of a problem.

48:03.793 --> 48:05.708
Probably easily
influenced to being

48:05.795 --> 48:07.928
in that kind of environment.

48:10.844 --> 48:12.411
[sighs]

48:14.108 --> 48:18.286
- You know, that, that sounds
a lot like being in jail.

48:21.202 --> 48:25.641
You've got these people in
there for minor offenses and

48:26.686 --> 48:28.557
they end up so much worse off

48:28.644 --> 48:32.518
because of the influences
they encounter there.

48:33.780 --> 48:34.563
- Yeah.

48:37.740 --> 48:42.049
Some of those places are,
yeah, they're pretty awful.

48:42.136 --> 48:43.442
- Yeah, I know.

48:45.313 --> 48:48.360
- There's good ones
too, like the Ramsey's,

48:48.447 --> 48:51.493
and I guess he didn't
get that lucky.

48:54.018 --> 48:56.934
Poor kid didn't
even stand a chance.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.551
- So are there any leads
on where he could be

49:05.638 --> 49:07.118
or anything like that?

49:07.205 --> 49:08.728
- No, no, we don't have that.

49:08.815 --> 49:13.385
We don't have anything solid,
but I've put an APB out.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.954
Hopefully he turns up.

49:24.831 --> 49:25.875
- Listen.

49:29.401 --> 49:33.709
I know how much stuff
like this affects you

49:33.796 --> 49:35.363

1:08:58.177 --> 1:09:01.702
Bruce, I never thought
I would see you again.

1:09:05.053 --> 1:09:07.012
- So what's going on with you?

1:09:07.099 --> 1:09:11.669
I mean, this is the last place
I would expect to see you,

1:09:11.756 --> 1:09:13.497
out of all people.

1:09:13.584 --> 1:09:16.630
- It's [chuckles]
funny you should ask.

1:09:16.717 --> 1:09:19.111
I actually worked here.

1:09:19.198 --> 1:09:23.376
It was then that I saw
firsthand what addiction does,

1:09:23.463 --> 1:09:27.032
whether it be drugs,
alcohol, or gambling.

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:32.080
So I started an outreach
called No Excuses.

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:34.561
It helps people get free and

1:09:37.042 --> 1:09:40.001
take authority over
their situation.

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:42.526
- So you actually worked here?

1:09:42.613 --> 1:09:44.136
- Yeah, I mean I had to survive,

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:48.923
and this was the only
place hiring at the time.

1:09:49.010 --> 1:09:51.970
[sighs] Gosh, I prayed every
day that I wouldn't have to do

1:09:52.057 --> 1:09:56.192
anything that went against
my faith and God made a way.

1:09:57.671 --> 1:09:59.107
- So you don't work
here anymore, then?

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:02.546
- No, no, it was my mission
field and it still is,

1:10:02.633 --> 1:10:06.854
but, you know, after starting
the ministry, it just,

1:10:06.941 --> 1:10:08.334
I don't know, I didn't
feel good about it.

1:10:08.421 --> 1:10:09.857
It just wasn't sending
the right message

1:10:09.944 --> 1:10:11.990
to those I was helping.

1:10:12.077 --> 1:10:14.601
- So what's your
mission tonight, then?

1:10:14.688 --> 1:10:16.821
- Well, I was looking
for a girl named Alicia

1:10:16.908 --> 1:10:19.389
who's in the program,
I think she relapsed.

1:10:19.476 --> 1:10:24.220
She wasn't at home, so that
pretty much leaves this place.

1:10:26.047 --> 1:10:27.962
You do realize it's
not a coincidence

1:10:28.049 --> 1:10:29.486
we ran into each other
tonight, don't you?

1:10:29.573 --> 1:10:32.271
- Oh, boy, you haven't
changed a bit, have ya?

1:10:32.358 --> 1:10:36.493
- [Suzy] Well, it could
be that you're my mission.

1:10:39.931 --> 1:10:43.848
- Believe me, you don't
wanna go down that road.

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:47.243
- [Suzy] Pretty rough, huh?

1:10:49.897 --> 1:10:54.728
- Yeah, I was pulled from the
street against my will and...

1:10:57.862 --> 1:11:00.604
- Bruce, how did
it happen, I mean,

1:11:00.691 --> 1:11:05.261
I saw you at church, we said
goodbye and that was it.

1:11:05.348 --> 1:11:08.786
Do you feel like
talking about it?

1:11:08.873 --> 1:11:12.224
- Well, let's just say
I didn't get very far.

1:11:12.311 --> 1:11:15.183
Maybe a couple
blocks, that was it.

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:17.098
A car pulled up and,

1:11:19.275 --> 1:11:20.058
Tiberius,

1:11:21.494 --> 1:11:22.321

1:11:23.453 --> 1:11:24.454
he was there.

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:28.719
And he asked me for
directions to Herb's Garage.

1:11:28.806 --> 1:11:30.416
- Yeah, I remember that place.

1:11:30.503 --> 1:11:34.725
- Yeah, we all did, and so
I didn't expect a thing.

1:11:36.857 --> 1:11:38.685
I walked right into it.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:43.342
He flashed a gun
and pulled me in

1:11:43.429 --> 1:11:48.216
and that night they showed
me what they wanted with me.

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:50.871

first drop and...

1:11:52.177 --> 1:11:54.397
The things they made me do.

1:11:58.183 --> 1:11:59.619
Unspeakable things.

1:12:01.273 --> 1:12:05.408
And maybe I didn't have a
choice, at the beginning.

1:12:05.495 --> 1:12:06.278
Later on?

1:12:08.933 --> 1:12:10.978
I'm not so sure.

1:12:11.065 --> 1:12:14.765

be a product of your past.

1:12:23.643 --> 1:12:26.124

down this rough road

1:12:26.211 --> 1:12:28.996

I've seen them get free

a hope then a future.

argue with that one, too.
