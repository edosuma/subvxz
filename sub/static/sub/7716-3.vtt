WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.210
Back orders and you
never called them

00:04.421 --> 00:07.297
Can you believe this?
There's a dog in the car.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.427
You can't leave a dog
in a parked car!

00:11.928 --> 00:13.846
Snowboarder, it figures

00:13.930 --> 00:15.389
Do snowboarders
hate animals?

00:15.473 --> 00:17.641
I bet this guy didn't
leave his weed in the car

00:18.018 --> 00:21.228
Okay, we have to do something because
this is incredibly dangerous.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.563
Oscar, it's not
that hot out

00:22.647 --> 00:24.773
A car parked in the sun
is like a toaster oven.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.276
Well, we don't know how long
the driver's been gone

00:27.360 --> 00:29.111
and it's not
in direct sunlight

00:29.195 --> 00:31.363
So what, Andy? You want to
just let him die, you scumbag?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.490
Here, I'm going
to get in my car

00:33.575 --> 00:37.077
When I start dying, I will
honk the horn three times

00:37.162 --> 00:38.871
That means
save the dog

00:38.955 --> 00:40.039
Okay
you know what?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.457
I'm going to give him
something to drink

00:41.541 --> 00:42.541
Come here, doggy

00:45.128 --> 00:46.128
Come on

00:46.212 --> 00:47.212
Dwight
at least aim it

00:47.297 --> 00:48.547
There you go
Here, doggy.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.132
He's not even trying Come
here doggy, come on.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.467
We're losing
cloud cover.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.218
Don't try to get in
on it now, Michael Vick

00:53.303 --> 00:55.304
Hey, hey, hey
Vick did his time

00:55.388 --> 00:58.348
This guy's been gone long enough.
He's lost his right to a window.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.600
Get back, buddy
Get back

00:59.684 --> 01:00.893
Oscar, what are you
What... No, hey

01:04.313 --> 01:05.480
All right

01:05.565 --> 01:06.899
Yeah

01:06.983 --> 01:08.650
Nice job, Oscar

01:08.777 --> 01:11.153
And one
for good measure.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.529
Yeah

01:12.614 --> 01:14.823
So, who's going
to take the dog?

01:15.116 --> 01:16.492
Why would we
take the dog?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.368
What if he jumps out
the window and runs away?

01:18.661 --> 01:20.704
Jim, he's not
going to start...

01:20.789 --> 01:21.997
Stay, stay

01:22.082 --> 01:23.707
Nein. Sitz!

01:24.250 --> 01:25.417
Gut.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.711
Oscar, what do you want to do?
This is kind of your deal.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.171
You want a dog?

01:33.384 --> 01:34.927
There we go
that should do it

01:35.011 --> 01:37.012
Yeah, it's good.
It'll work

01:37.097 --> 01:38.055
Nice job

01:38.181 --> 01:39.681
Bye, poochie
Bye, doggy

01:39.766 --> 01:41.433
Bye

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.711 --> 02:10.795
What's that come to? Like,
what did they each win?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.465
Oh, man, it's gotta
be over $100,000.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.842
Yeah, before taxes

02:14.926 --> 02:16.718
That's still
a lot of money

02:17.387 --> 02:19.763
The warehouse crew won
the lottery yesterday.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.808
$950,000.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.268
And then they quit.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.061
And no one else
can focus.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.354
This is it.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.772
This is all
on my shoulders.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.983
I'm the one who has to tell
everyone to get back to work

02:31.067 --> 02:33.652
I'm the one who has to tell Darryl
to hire a new warehouse crew

02:33.736 --> 02:36.905
I'm the one who has
to say those things.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.493
Hello?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.414
Justine.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.749
Nice surprise.
How you doing, baby?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.837
No, no, no.
I didn't win

02:51.921 --> 02:53.338
When I got promoted
I stopped...

02:53.423 --> 02:54.464
What?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.217
Yeah, Glenn won

02:59.304 --> 03:02.181
You want to call him?
Yeah, you should call him

03:02.265 --> 03:03.765
Congratulate him
That would be

03:04.726 --> 03:05.767
What?

03:06.853 --> 03:09.229
His number is
in your old phone

03:09.480 --> 03:11.023
Oh, you know what?
I might have it right

03:11.107 --> 03:12.191
Whoops.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.861
When I worked in the warehouse,
I was part of that lotto pool.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.738
They won

03:18.781 --> 03:20.324
playing my birthday

03:20.783 --> 03:23.535
What really interests me is the
group dynamic of six people

03:23.620 --> 03:24.620
winning the lottery

03:24.787 --> 03:25.829
This will not
end well, right?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.039
Yeah

03:27.123 --> 03:28.457
We're looking at
at least one suicide

03:28.541 --> 03:30.334
and one weird sex thing.
At least

03:30.668 --> 03:32.294
I don't even know what
I'd do with all that money

03:32.378 --> 03:33.712
I know what you'd do
with all that money

03:33.796 --> 03:36.632
"Hey, Pam Let's buy expensive
bathrobes and hug.'

03:36.716 --> 03:39.092
No, I'd probably buy a big
piece of land in Maine

03:39.177 --> 03:41.178
build a house
work in town.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.722
Somewhere I could
bike to or kayak to.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.974
I'd either bike to my job
at the kayak shop

03:46.059 --> 03:48.060
or I'd kayak to my job
at the bike shop.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.519
And then on the weekends
would you hacky sack

03:49.604 --> 03:51.605
back to reality and spend time
with your wife and kids?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.233
Whoa, Saucy I thought
you liked Maine.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.693
I think we should get
a townhouse in Soho

03:56.778 --> 03:58.195
Soho's mostly lofts
but okay

03:58.696 --> 04:01.448
And then, every morning
I'd walk out onto my terrace

04:01.532 --> 04:04.243
and I would breathe in
the inspiration of the city

04:04.327 --> 04:07.579
You know, and just gather
ideas for my painting

04:07.664 --> 04:08.789
Oh, God

04:09.040 --> 04:10.582
And then my
handsome husband

04:10.667 --> 04:11.875
Which, ideally
would be me.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.043
Would bring me
a flavored coffee

04:13.127 --> 04:15.504
Stop. I'm a barista
in your fantasy?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.422
Well, in your fantasy we're
Stephen King characters

04:17.507 --> 04:18.798
I don't know
about Stephen King

04:18.882 --> 04:21.009
Get a divorce
Get a divorce

04:21.511 --> 04:22.928
I think I would
keep working

04:23.012 --> 04:26.515
And for my salary, I guess I
would take like, $1 a year.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.935
Obviously, I wouldn't
come in till noon

04:30.019 --> 04:32.020
And I wouldn't do anything
I didn't want to do

04:33.314 --> 04:36.483
I mean, I'm getting paid $1 a year, okay?
You can chill

04:37.277 --> 04:38.986
Are you kidding me?

04:39.195 --> 04:41.446
Guys, if I have to ask you to
get back to work one more time

04:41.531 --> 04:43.407
I'm gonna change my tone

04:43.783 --> 04:45.409
To down here, like Mr. T

04:45.910 --> 04:47.703
And this would get
seriously annoying

04:48.371 --> 04:50.747
I feel sympathy for the jerks who
have to listen to this all day

04:51.291 --> 04:52.291
Darryl

04:52.375 --> 04:53.750
How we doing on
the new warehouse guys?

04:53.835 --> 04:54.876
I don't know

04:55.461 --> 04:57.296
What... Do we have
new guys?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.380
No

04:58.464 --> 04:59.756
Are they on
their way over?

04:59.841 --> 05:00.841
I haven't hired anyone

05:00.925 --> 05:02.467
What? No warehouse guys?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.803
I have an important order
that has to go out by 5:00

05:04.887 --> 05:06.471
I e-mailed you about it

05:06.556 --> 05:08.390
I'm not checking
e-mail till lunch

05:09.058 --> 05:10.267
Four hour work week

05:10.351 --> 05:11.643
This is kind of
time-sensitive

05:11.728 --> 05:13.020
I got it. I'm doing it

05:13.730 --> 05:16.898
Andy, this is a seriously big order.
I can't lose this client.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.525
All right, well
until we have a new crew

05:18.609 --> 05:20.110
let's get some volunteers
for warehouse duty

05:20.194 --> 05:21.236
Who's in?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.821
As long as you guys
don't need me up here

05:22.905 --> 05:24.740
I think we'll be fine
No, we don't.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.117
Really? Nobody's going
to help her?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.286
Is chivalry dead?
Are you volunteering?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.413
Of course, I would

05:31.914 --> 05:33.832
But my hip

05:33.916 --> 05:35.334
I would kill
to be at 100%

05:35.418 --> 05:36.460
Jim, how about you?

05:36.544 --> 05:37.711
Yeah. I mean

05:37.795 --> 05:39.963
as the strongest person in
this office, I guess I should

05:40.048 --> 05:41.506
Okay, no, no

05:41.591 --> 05:44.301
That... You are
so not... Oh, God

05:45.803 --> 05:48.889
False. Andy,
I will volunteer

05:49.307 --> 05:50.349
Great

05:51.059 --> 05:52.017
And Kevin

05:53.394 --> 05:57.272
Good old Kevin.
He'll do anything

05:57.690 --> 05:59.024
Well, guess what?

05:59.108 --> 06:01.943
I will not do
a good job.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.032
Thank you
Sure.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.283
Wait, wait.
What's this?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.744
Oh, sorry

06:10.828 --> 06:13.246
I thought it was a
guess-your-baby's-birth-weight pool.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.083
It says "lotto pool'
right on top.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.793
Yeah, and I said sorry

06:19.462 --> 06:20.420
Oh, come on

06:20.505 --> 06:22.547
You really think I'm going
to have a 14-pound baby?

06:30.848 --> 06:32.307
When did I get so fat?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.850
You look awesome

06:33.935 --> 06:35.685
I didn't hire anyone,
if that's why you're here

06:35.770 --> 06:36.978
Where are we
in the process?

06:37.313 --> 06:38.897
I have a file
of applicants here

06:38.981 --> 06:41.566
I just gotta open it
look at it,

06:41.651 --> 06:43.485
interview a bunch of guys
hire some of them.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.821
So I say we're in the early
stages of the process.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.615
Did you go out celebrating
with the guys last night?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.700
They guys did invite
me out to celebrate,

06:50.785 --> 06:52.994
but I decided
to just stay home

06:53.830 --> 06:55.664
Eat a bunch of tacos
in my basement

06:56.165 --> 06:57.707
You do have
a fantastic basement

06:57.792 --> 06:58.834
I did

07:00.253 --> 07:02.170
I did have
a fantastic basement

07:03.631 --> 07:05.507
Now it smells
like tacos.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.176
You can't air out
a basement

07:08.845 --> 07:10.470
And taco air is heavy

07:11.013 --> 07:12.889
It settles
at the lowest point

07:15.226 --> 07:17.227
Right. Um

07:18.020 --> 07:20.188
Well, how about we take
a look at some applications?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.899
This guy wrote his
in green ink.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.234
That's pretty cool
Check it out.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.782
Hey

07:30.867 --> 07:32.951
There you go
There he is

07:34.537 --> 07:36.079
That is not Darryl

07:36.164 --> 07:38.457
I don't know where Darryl is
I suspect, probably,

07:38.541 --> 07:42.043
our Darryl is inside
of Fat Darryl.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.256
Okay, 300 boxes
of 20-pound white

07:47.175 --> 07:50.135
That's 75 boxes per person
So, that's not so bad.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.219
Negative

07:51.554 --> 07:54.514
Three hundred boxes for me
zero for you chumps

07:54.599 --> 07:55.807
Deal with it

07:57.185 --> 07:58.185
Nice

07:59.979 --> 08:01.188
Oh, oh, oh

08:03.316 --> 08:04.357
Damn

08:17.914 --> 08:18.914
Yup

08:23.419 --> 08:25.128
Welcome, everybody

08:25.880 --> 08:29.174
My name is Andy, and this
is my other brother, Darryl

08:32.303 --> 08:33.720
What? No Newhart fans?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.554
Okay

08:35.640 --> 08:37.599
Darryl, how do we usually
kick these things off?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.436
You mean, what did we do the last
time the warehouse won the lottery?

08:41.645 --> 08:42.938
Your old crew
won the lottery?

08:43.022 --> 08:48.360
Does anyone have experience
shelving, storing keeping track...

08:48.444 --> 08:49.986
What do we use?
The Dewey Decimal System?

08:50.071 --> 08:52.364
Wait, wait. So, all
the old guys quit?

08:52.448 --> 08:53.532
Oh, yeah
Well

08:53.616 --> 08:56.660
One of them, Glenn is starting
one of those fat camps

08:56.744 --> 08:58.411
where he steals your kid
in the middle of the night

08:58.496 --> 09:01.248
Madge and a couple other guys
might start a strip club.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.541
But on a boat

09:02.625 --> 09:07.796
And Hide is investing in an energy
drink for Asian homosexuals

09:10.258 --> 09:11.716
Could you guys
give us a minute?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.511
But stay close
You're all doing great

09:15.555 --> 09:17.722
Maybe grab a coffee
or if there's any donuts out

09:17.807 --> 09:18.848
you can split one

09:19.517 --> 09:21.643
You know they're for everybody
so people get fussy

09:22.478 --> 09:24.479
You know what?
Just have a donut

09:34.240 --> 09:36.199
Do you want to talk about this
not-winning-the-lottery thing?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.242
I don't

09:37.326 --> 09:40.996
You sure? 'Cause you keep
talking about it, so

09:41.414 --> 09:44.207
Nope. I'm good
I'm here.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.918
Let's find some warehouse
workers Good, great.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.297
Then, can you say things that aren't,
like, a huge bummer to everybody?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.592
'Cause the more I talk the
more they're going to realize

09:53.676 --> 09:55.051
I don't know
what I'm talking about

09:55.136 --> 09:56.136
Okay

09:56.220 --> 09:57.804
We need you, okay?
Okay

09:57.888 --> 09:58.888
Okay?
Yeah

09:58.973 --> 10:00.015
All right

10:03.227 --> 10:04.227
Ah

10:06.105 --> 10:07.564
What's the problem?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.691
Grunting is scientifically
proven to add more power

10:09.775 --> 10:11.610
Ask any female tennis player

10:11.694 --> 10:13.028
or her husband

10:17.325 --> 10:18.325
I didn't feel anything

10:21.037 --> 10:24.289
All right, thank you
for coming back in again.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.542
Now, we're going to ask you a few
questions Darryl, you have the floor.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.793
Why do you want
to work here?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.003
I need a job

10:30.087 --> 10:31.129
It's not a good reason

10:31.213 --> 10:32.213
Good

10:32.548 --> 10:33.506
Keeping them honest

10:33.591 --> 10:35.550
Don't just take the first
job that comes your way

10:35.926 --> 10:39.512
'Cause next thing you know it's 10
years later, and you're still there

10:39.764 --> 10:41.848
You could write
your obituary tomorrow

10:42.058 --> 10:43.058
It's not going
to change.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.770
Are we scaring
them straight?

10:46.854 --> 10:47.896
I hope so

10:47.980 --> 10:49.147
Think about
this carefully

10:49.857 --> 10:51.566
There's better lives
than this one.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.449
I've never been lucky

10:59.533 --> 11:00.909
And I'm not talking
about the lottery

11:00.993 --> 11:05.747
I'm talking about stuff like
developing a soy allergy at 35.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.542
Who gets a soy allergy at /5?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.920
And why is soy in everything?

11:13.130 --> 11:15.507
Nice, right back
where I like you

11:15.591 --> 11:17.634
Can you make 10 copies
of this for me? No

11:17.718 --> 11:19.094
Why not? What
are you doing?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.221
Buying lottery
tickets online

11:23.265 --> 11:26.601
Everyone wants to be rich but
nobody wants to work for it

11:27.603 --> 11:28.853
You came in
at 10:30 today, right?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.855
Okay, I'll just
do this myself

11:33.693 --> 11:36.528
Is everyone licensed?
Like a driver's license?

11:36.612 --> 11:38.154
No, warehouse license

11:39.699 --> 11:41.282
Masters in
warehouse sciences?

11:41.951 --> 11:44.703
I feel that Darryl has talked
about a license of some kind

11:44.787 --> 11:47.789
Is this a joke?
No. Not joking.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.124
This is real

11:50.209 --> 11:52.669
Painfully real, what
is happening right now

11:54.672 --> 11:58.007
Okay, I'm not going to
make it I'm turning back

11:58.968 --> 12:00.635
There's gotta be
a better way to do this

12:00.720 --> 12:02.387
This is literally how
they built the pyramids

12:02.471 --> 12:04.597
Well, they whipped people
which was helpful.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.058
But you're right. We should be
able to find a more efficient way

12:07.143 --> 12:08.977
of moving boxes
than Madge or Hide

12:09.061 --> 12:10.061
Yeah

12:10.730 --> 12:12.647
Not that they're
not smart people

12:13.274 --> 12:14.983
No, no, very smart

12:15.067 --> 12:16.526
Theirs is more of a
physical intelligence

12:16.610 --> 12:17.610
I'd go with that

12:17.695 --> 12:18.903
Like baboons
or elephants.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.113
Not that, don't

12:20.197 --> 12:24.033
Guys, when I was a kid my
sisters used to butter me up

12:24.118 --> 12:27.787
and slide me across the
linoleum floor of the kitchen.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.622
It really made
them laugh.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.749
It's a great idea, Kev

12:30.833 --> 12:31.791
I don't think
it applies here, though

12:31.876 --> 12:32.876
So, maybe we just

12:32.960 --> 12:35.503
Yeah, we move stuff
and have fun.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.755
Kevin
doesn't apply

12:37.339 --> 12:38.465
Right, my mom

12:38.549 --> 12:41.050
You need
to drop it, okay?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.427
They hate it

12:42.511 --> 12:45.180
I like it a lot but they
hate it so drop it.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.645
Does anyone get distracted
easily by bubble wrap?

12:56.233 --> 12:59.694
You'll be dealing with lots of
bubble wrap, obviously. Um...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.362
How much longer
is this going to take?

13:03.699 --> 13:04.699
Did you hire them?

13:05.659 --> 13:07.035
No, because
they all left.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.037
What do you mean
they left?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.831
I mean, after you bailed

13:12.541 --> 13:15.210
I got confused and
frankly, a little weird

13:15.669 --> 13:18.671
And the stuff that you said
certainly didn't help

13:19.048 --> 13:20.715
Then I think you
should fire me.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.635
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to fire you

13:23.719 --> 13:25.637
Yeah, just put me out
of my misery.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.143
Okay, this is weird.
I don't get the joke

13:32.228 --> 13:33.645
No? Okay

13:36.690 --> 13:38.233
I don't want
to be here anymore

13:39.693 --> 13:40.902
Fire me

13:46.575 --> 13:48.076
So Darryl says
to me, "Fire me, '

13:48.577 --> 13:50.745
but what he really means is

13:51.205 --> 13:53.957
"I'm going to say something really weird,
try and figure out what it means."

13:54.583 --> 13:57.126
So I say, "No,
you're not fired.'

13:57.211 --> 13:59.295
But what I really mean is

13:59.380 --> 14:01.798
"I've no idea what
you're talking about

14:02.675 --> 14:03.758
"But I'm going to go ahead
and hire some people

14:03.843 --> 14:06.511
"for the warehouse and hope that you
eventually start feeling better."

14:09.974 --> 14:11.975
I really hope that's
what he and I mean

14:13.853 --> 14:14.853
Attention

14:14.937 --> 14:16.938
Does anyone know anyone who
could work in the warehouse?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.064
We can pay

14:18.524 --> 14:19.858
Come on, Oscar

14:19.942 --> 14:21.943
Who's the most jacked guy
in all of Scranton?

14:22.027 --> 14:23.486
Like your wildest
fantasy guy?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.779
Bulk or definition?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.030
Definition

14:26.115 --> 14:28.241
Bruce Kenward. He hangs
out at Planet Fitness

14:28.617 --> 14:30.702
Are those just show muscles
or is he really strong?

14:30.786 --> 14:31.953
Oh, he's plenty strong

14:32.329 --> 14:35.540
It used to be Reggie Winters
out at Gold's Gym

14:35.624 --> 14:36.624
But he moved away

14:36.709 --> 14:39.127
And then it was between
Bruce and this guy, Dean

14:41.130 --> 14:43.798
But Dean got fixated
on his calves,

14:43.883 --> 14:44.883
and, uh

14:45.843 --> 14:47.343
And his triceps
went to hell.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.554
So, I've been thinking

14:49.638 --> 14:51.598
after we win the lottery
we take our winnings...

14:51.682 --> 14:52.682
Our fake winnings

14:52.766 --> 14:54.434
And we move
to the South of France

14:54.518 --> 14:57.437
See... No, there's plenty
of bicycling for you.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.688
I think that's where they
do the Tour de France

14:58.772 --> 14:59.814
It is, yeah

14:59.899 --> 15:01.024
I mean, I just don't know
why I'm compromising

15:01.108 --> 15:02.108
if it's my fantasy

15:02.192 --> 15:04.527
Because in my fantasy,
it's Maine, and you love it

15:04.612 --> 15:06.863
Because I'm never going to act
like that, even in your fantasy

15:07.990 --> 15:10.825
Nope, you're doing a great job
of it in my fantasy right now

15:11.827 --> 15:13.578
Hey, idiot, what did
Erin want again?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.622
A hot chocolate tea

15:16.457 --> 15:20.293
Gideon, you are
a PhD candidate

15:20.377 --> 15:23.254
studying America's diminishing
blue-collar workforce?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.464
North America

15:24.548 --> 15:28.176
And "diminishing" is a little reductive,
but, sure that's the headline version

15:28.844 --> 15:29.886
Great

15:30.721 --> 15:33.181
Well, it will bring a fresh, new
perspective to the warehouse.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.434
FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have
a pretty full teaching schedule.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.853
Oh, cool We'll figure that out.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.647
Also, FYI

15:41.982 --> 15:45.276
I don't technically
have a hearing problem

15:45.361 --> 15:49.697
But sometimes, when there's a lot of
noises occurring at the same time

15:49.865 --> 15:51.699
I'll hear them
as one big jumble

15:52.701 --> 15:54.953
Again, it's not
that I can't hear

15:55.037 --> 15:56.704
Because that's false, I can

15:57.122 --> 16:00.833
Um, I just can't distinguish
between everything I'm hearing.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.127
Got it. Duly noted

16:03.212 --> 16:04.212
You

16:04.296 --> 16:07.298
coolest tank top I have ever seen.
Where did you get that?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.050
Made it.
So cool

16:09.134 --> 16:10.551
What a cross section
we have here.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.095
It's what I love
about interviewing

16:12.179 --> 16:13.304
I get to meet
all these people

16:13.389 --> 16:16.391
I wouldn't ordinarily meet,
or know or even talk to.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.476
Message in a Bottle,
The Postman...

16:18.560 --> 16:20.687
Kevin Costner
Kevin Costner, yeah

16:24.858 --> 16:26.484
So

16:26.568 --> 16:27.986
I found this grease

16:28.070 --> 16:30.488
And then I remembered that you
thought it was a great idea.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.407
You did say
it was a great idea

16:32.491 --> 16:33.574
I heard you say it

16:35.911 --> 16:38.454
So it's not
the dumbest idea

16:38.539 --> 16:39.664
It's not the
greatest one...

16:39.748 --> 16:41.833
But the fact remains,
we gotta move these boxes.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.876
And it's clear we're
not going to carry them.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.672
So sadly, it's the best
idea on the table. Exactly.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.299
Hey, I think we're
ready to get this...

16:51.301 --> 16:52.343
Jim?
Is he okay?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.594
He'll be fine

16:55.681 --> 16:58.599
Surprise! Your new crew

16:59.768 --> 17:01.102
Would you just
fire me, man?

17:02.604 --> 17:04.856
Hey, why? Because you
didn't win the lottery?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.358
How am I supposed
to make you happy?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.234
You want to make
me happy? Huh?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.486
Yeah
Give me your job.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.780
Haha. What? I'll do
it better than you

17:13.531 --> 17:15.532
I earned it,
I deserve it

17:15.617 --> 17:17.492
I got passed over
God knows why.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.496
Reasons I cannot
and will not understand

17:21.457 --> 17:23.958
The job was mine, Andy
Everyone said it was mine

17:25.252 --> 17:27.545
Make me manager
or fire me.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.464
I'm not going
to give you my job

17:29.548 --> 17:31.090
It's my job
I earned it!

17:32.801 --> 17:35.011
And here's the thing You
weren't even next in line.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.846
I asked about you
I saw your file

17:36.930 --> 17:38.514
You have a history of
being short with people

17:38.599 --> 17:40.683
and you hired Glenn
your buddy,

17:40.768 --> 17:42.101
to replace you
in the warehouse

17:42.227 --> 17:44.312
He was under-qualified
They saw that.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.189
Also, Darryl, FYI

17:46.273 --> 17:47.857
I already told
this to Andy

17:47.941 --> 17:49.150
but you should
probably know

17:49.234 --> 17:52.028
I technically don't have
a hearing problem

17:52.321 --> 17:55.782
It's just when there's a lot of noises...
Nate. Please.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.117
Thank you.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.122
You have no
business education

18:03.207 --> 18:05.958
You were going to take classes under
Deangelo What happened to that?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.085
He died

18:07.169 --> 18:08.711
He didn't die,
his brain died

18:08.796 --> 18:10.797
And my brain is still
very much alive

18:10.881 --> 18:12.924
And I'd be happy to give
you business classes

18:13.008 --> 18:14.425
How come you haven't
asked me about it?

18:14.510 --> 18:15.885
What was...
What was the last

18:16.845 --> 18:17.929
I'm having a

18:18.013 --> 18:20.348
No part of this has
anything to do with you

18:21.934 --> 18:24.143
I didn't have time
because of my daughter

18:24.228 --> 18:26.145
But you had time
for a softball clinic

18:26.605 --> 18:27.605
And a Mediterranean
cooking class.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.858
Hey, I'm not going to tell you this stuff if
you're going to throw it back in my face!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.110
Hey, here's the thing

18:32.194 --> 18:34.737
Jo saw something in you
She loved you.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.491
She gave you a shot and
then you stopped pushing.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.118
She noticed

18:48.252 --> 18:49.293
Okay

18:49.378 --> 18:50.378
Okay, what?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.882
Okay, don't fire me

18:59.555 --> 19:00.555
Okay

19:01.557 --> 19:05.476
My future's not going to be determined
by seven little white lotto balls.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.771
It's going to be determined
by two big black balls.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.399
I control my destiny

19:12.693 --> 19:13.734
I do

19:14.987 --> 19:16.529
I'll put some
guys on tonight

19:16.613 --> 19:18.865
The best of your bunch
and my bunch

19:18.949 --> 19:21.075
I'll tell you now, though it's
going to be mostly my bunch

19:21.160 --> 19:22.910
Yeah, that makes sense

19:22.995 --> 19:24.579
Okay, good
All right.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.122
Are they here?

19:26.206 --> 19:27.748
What is going on?

19:27.833 --> 19:28.833
Oh, hey, guys

19:28.917 --> 19:30.710
Why is the forklift
in the wall?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.128
Why is
the truck empty?

19:32.212 --> 19:33.671
It's not totally empty

19:33.755 --> 19:34.922
Is that grease
on my floor?

19:36.466 --> 19:37.967
Okay

19:38.051 --> 19:40.136
I can see why you're angry.
You're coming into this cold

19:40.220 --> 19:43.848
But believe me a lot of
thought went into this.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.434
And did your brains tell you to
ruin these boxes with grease?

19:46.518 --> 19:47.935
Okay, Darryl

19:48.020 --> 19:50.688
Listen, and then
you will understand

19:50.772 --> 19:54.066
The boxes were ruined during
our first trial testing.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.694
So now, it's cool 'cause we
found another use for them

19:56.778 --> 19:58.529
Okay, all right

19:58.614 --> 20:01.449
That's... Look, all we were trying
to do is we thought we could come up

20:01.533 --> 20:03.117
with a more efficient
way to do things.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.660
And?

20:04.745 --> 20:05.870
And we did.
I don't know

20:05.954 --> 20:08.164
Jim, tell them
what it's called

20:08.957 --> 20:10.208
That's all right

20:10.292 --> 20:11.542
No, Jim, tell them
what the name is

20:11.627 --> 20:13.127
Doesn't matter
what the name is

20:14.129 --> 20:16.255
Señor Loadenstein
that's stupid.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.382
Señor Loadenstein

20:18.467 --> 20:20.051
Tell them why
it's called that, Jim

20:20.135 --> 20:21.844
That's okay, we're good

20:21.929 --> 20:25.306
No, Jim, tell us why it's
called señor Loadenstein

20:27.309 --> 20:28.559
Porque es muy rápido.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.895
Okay, you know what?
It's been a real busy day.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.021
What do you say
we put all this away?

20:32.105 --> 20:33.606
Let me see it

20:33.690 --> 20:35.233
It's in beta testing

20:35.317 --> 20:36.484
Let me see it

20:36.568 --> 20:37.568
Get the thing, go

20:37.653 --> 20:39.946
Lube it up.
Kevin, start mopping

20:40.030 --> 20:42.323
Uno, dos, tres.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.496
Yeah. I lost my client

20:50.666 --> 20:54.085
I already won the lottery I
was born in the US of A, baby

20:54.419 --> 20:56.295
And as backup,
I have a Swiss passport

20:57.130 --> 20:59.215
I would spend
a lot of time

20:59.716 --> 21:02.510
launching my true crime podcast
"The Flenderson Files.'

21:02.928 --> 21:04.011
Duh-buh-bum

21:04.596 --> 21:06.013
Flenderson Files

21:06.181 --> 21:07.431
We came
to an agreement

21:07.516 --> 21:10.101
We're going to live in a
stunning pre-war brownstone

21:10.185 --> 21:11.310
at the top of a mountain

21:11.395 --> 21:12.937
Right, it's city
and country combined

21:13.021 --> 21:15.898
Just a subway stop away are the
best museums in the world.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.360
And I can fish right from the
window of Pam's pottery studio

21:19.653 --> 21:21.529
We can chat
any time we want

21:21.863 --> 21:24.532
Just like now

21:25.117 --> 21:27.910
It's too bad the schools are terrible,
but what are you going to do about that?

21:27.995 --> 21:28.995
What are you
going to do?

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
