00:10.208 --> 00:13.834
Sorry, Mr. Bunty.

00:10.208 --> 00:13.834
Have a nice lunch.

00:14.583 --> 00:17.166
Hologram's working, Doc.

00:14.583 --> 00:17.166
Game on.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.792
Thanks, Cody.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.792
Chase, you want to review

00:20.834 --> 00:22.542
the rules for everyone

00:20.834 --> 00:22.542
before we play?

00:22.583 --> 00:25.959
Certainly. The rules

00:22.583 --> 00:25.959
of Rescue Ball are...

00:26.000 --> 00:27.458
there are no rules.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.000
Exactly.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.000
Try to get the ball

00:29.041 --> 00:32.834
through the other team's goal

00:29.041 --> 00:32.834
by any means necessary. Ready?

00:32.875 --> 00:35.583
Does a scraplet eat metal?

00:35.625 --> 00:36.917
That's a yes.

Whoa!

00:43.792 --> 00:46.583
Ooh. Too low, too slow.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.125
And too much ego.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.000
( grunts )

00:51.041 --> 00:53.834
May the force field

00:51.041 --> 00:53.834
be with you, Dani.

Unh!

CHIEF:

01:01.166 --> 01:02.542
End of the road, Frankie.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.083
Sorry to disagree, Chief,

01:04.125 --> 01:06.542
but I'm going through a phase.

01:04.125 --> 01:06.542
( beeps )

01:09.125 --> 01:11.000
Whoa.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.250
( whistle blows )

01:12.542 --> 01:15.250
One point for Heatwave's team.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.959
Nice one, Frankie.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.375
I thought Doc already gave

01:17.000 --> 01:19.375
that phasing tech

01:19.417 --> 01:20.875
to the company who ordered it.

01:20.917 --> 01:23.333
I got to keep the prototypes.

01:25.041 --> 01:29.917
I own plenty of corporations

01:25.041 --> 01:29.917
that can get me anything I want.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.125
So tell me, Dr. Morocco,

01:32.166 --> 01:34.792
why should I do business

01:32.166 --> 01:34.792
with you?

01:34.834 --> 01:40.250
I believe you were interested in

01:34.834 --> 01:40.250
acquiring some specialty robots?

01:40.291 --> 01:43.041

I'll even go a hundred.

Uh, I'm afraid I can't sell

It has so many uses.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.166
Now I'll tell everyone.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.458
Oh, I doubt that.

09:28.500 --> 09:33.417
In fact, you won't even remember

09:28.500 --> 09:33.417
this conversation.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:40.792 --> 09:42.667
( screams )

09:45.500 --> 09:47.709
BLADES:

09:45.500 --> 09:47.709
Where...am I?

09:47.750 --> 09:51.667
Heatwave?

09:47.750 --> 09:51.667
What happened to our ship?

09:51.709 --> 09:55.041
Oh, thank goodness

09:51.709 --> 09:55.041
you're all right, Blades.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.917
Your ship crashed on my planet.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.208
Optimus Prime

09:57.959 --> 10:00.208
has given me orders

10:00.250 --> 10:03.375
to guide your Rescue Bot team.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.709
Who are you?

10:04.750 --> 10:07.208
You may call me...

10:07.250 --> 10:09.667
Friend.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.458
CODY:

10:09.709 --> 10:11.458
Blades, check it out.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.583
I scored tickets

10:11.500 --> 10:13.583
to the Pirate Movie Marathon

10:13.625 --> 10:16.750
at the drive in.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.750
Are you in, matey?

10:16.792 --> 10:19.667
I will accompany you

10:16.792 --> 10:19.667
if you wish.

10:19.709 --> 10:23.083
Come on, Blades. Quit pouting

10:19.709 --> 10:23.083
about the game already.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.834
This is pirates.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.834
You love pirates.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.375
If you say so.

10:29.834 --> 10:32.083
( phone ringing )

10:32.125 --> 10:35.625
Chief, Dr. McSwain asked me

10:32.125 --> 10:35.625
to help her examine the mayor.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.041
There's nothing wrong with him

10:35.667 --> 10:39.041
physically, but mentally...

10:39.083 --> 10:43.166
MAYOR:

10:39.083 --> 10:43.166
When did I get this tattoo?

10:39.083 --> 10:43.166
And who's Rosebud?

10:43.208 --> 10:47.041
It seems he has forgotten

10:43.208 --> 10:47.041
the last ten years of his life.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.792
What do you think caused that?

10:48.834 --> 10:50.333
I'm not quite certain.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.625
I've been trying

10:50.375 --> 10:52.625
memory cues, but--

10:52.667 --> 10:56.792
Is that Chief? Charlie.

10:52.667 --> 10:56.792
I've had the best idea.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.458
What if we built a library

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
made totally

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
out of recyclables?

11:01.041 --> 11:04.083
( phone beeping )

11:01.041 --> 11:04.083
I'm gonna have to call you back.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.083
This is Chief, go ahead.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.000
CHASE:

11:06.125 --> 11:08.000
Sir. There's been an accident.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.792
Blades was monitoring

11:08.041 --> 11:09.792
the Police radio

11:09.834 --> 11:11.500
and detected a distress call.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.458
Two spelunkers are trapped

11:11.542 --> 11:14.458
by a cave-in on Mount Griffin.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.250
Why didn't they call us

11:14.500 --> 11:16.250
directly?

11:16.291 --> 11:19.709
I am not sure, sir. Blades said

11:16.291 --> 11:19.709
the radio signal was very faint.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.667
And there's no camera

11:19.750 --> 11:21.667
underground to spot them.

11:21.709 --> 11:24.041
We'd better hurry.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.083
( sirens wailing )

11:26.125 --> 11:29.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:32.458 --> 11:34.208
This cave's been closed

11:32.458 --> 11:34.208
to people for years.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.667
It's far too unstable.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.250
I wonder how anyone got in.

11:37.291 --> 11:40.458
What matters

11:37.291 --> 11:40.458
is getting them out.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.208
( grunts )

11:45.709 --> 11:47.083
CHIEF: Look out.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.083
( Dani screams )

11:47.125 --> 11:50.000
This cavern

11:47.125 --> 11:50.000
is too dangerous for humans.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.542
We should go in alone.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.542
Since when do I

11:51.583 --> 11:53.542
avoid danger?

11:53.583 --> 11:56.250
And since when do you

11:53.583 --> 11:56.250
volunteer for it?

11:56.291 --> 11:57.917
There's no time to argue.

11:57.959 --> 12:00.208
The people inside could be hurt

11:57.959 --> 12:00.208
and running out of air.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.417
Go ahead,

12:00.250 --> 12:03.417
but be careful.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.959
(  tense theme playing  )

12:12.542 --> 12:15.250
( grunting )

12:23.291 --> 12:25.709
Morocco?

12:25.750 --> 12:27.792
Retreat.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.959
Blades, move.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.583
Rescue Bots, report.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.583
What's going on in there?

12:36.625 --> 12:39.000
Rescue Bots, do you copy?

12:42.041 --> 12:43.792
Chase,

12:42.041 --> 12:43.792
why didn't you answer me?

12:43.834 --> 12:45.166
I was busy.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.000
Where are the spelunkers?

12:50.041 --> 12:52.417
BOULDER:

12:50.041 --> 12:52.417
There were no humans to rescue.

12:52.458 --> 12:55.542
HEATWAVE:

12:52.458 --> 12:55.542
The message was a prank.

12:55.583 --> 13:00.208
Weird. And Blades

12:55.583 --> 13:00.208
was the only one who heard it.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.709
Weirder.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.333
(  ominous theme playing  )

13:04.375 --> 13:05.625
( grunts )

13:05.667 --> 13:08.250
Morocco. And Blades.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.333
How could he betray us?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.375
I am not certain

13:10.375 --> 13:12.375
that was Blades.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.041
While I have enjoyed his recent

13:12.417 --> 13:15.041
dedication to procedure,

13:15.083 --> 13:17.458
it is quite unlike

13:15.083 --> 13:17.458
the Blades we know.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.125
I knew Graham shouldn't have

13:17.500 --> 13:20.125
kept that sample of meteor.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.583
Morocco must have stolen it and

13:20.166 --> 13:23.583
used its virus to capture us.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.333
Well, I don't intend

13:23.625 --> 13:26.333
to stay captured.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:28.166 --> 13:30.125
( grunting )

13:33.917 --> 13:36.333
Rescue Bots,

13:33.917 --> 13:36.333
roll to the exit.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.333
( grunting )

13:40.375 --> 13:42.000
Ah.

13:43.417 --> 13:47.291
Who's rap-rap-rapping

13:43.417 --> 13:47.291
at my door?

13:47.333 --> 13:49.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:49.083 --> 13:51.125
( groans )

13:52.750 --> 13:56.291
Where... Where are we?

13:56.333 --> 13:59.041
Well, that wraps up our shift,

13:56.333 --> 13:59.041
Chase.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.166
Let's head home for dinner.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.166
I'm starving.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.959
As you command,

14:01.208 --> 14:02.959
Chief Burns.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.166
Whoa.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.166
Chase, take it easy.

14:08.583 --> 14:12.083
Boulder, can you hand me

14:08.583 --> 14:12.083
an Allen wrench?

14:13.333 --> 14:16.583
That is not a wrench.

14:16.625 --> 14:17.959
Nice joke, bud.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.875
( tires squealing )

14:20.917 --> 14:24.458
Family meeting,

14:20.917 --> 14:24.458
upstairs.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.333
Something strange

14:24.500 --> 14:27.333
is going on with the Bots.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.125
They're not acting

14:27.375 --> 14:29.125
like themselves.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.917
I noticed that too.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.917
They've been weird lately.

14:31.959 --> 14:35.041
Heatwave's been great.

14:31.959 --> 14:35.041
No complaining, no arguing.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.417
( chuckles )

14:36.458 --> 14:38.250
What's wrong with him?

14:38.291 --> 14:41.291
I'm not sure. Why don't we

14:38.291 --> 14:41.291
all talk to our partners?

14:41.333 --> 14:44.208
See if we can find out

14:41.333 --> 14:44.208
what's bothering them.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.417
Hey, Heatwave.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.417
Can I ask you a question?

14:48.458 --> 14:49.834
If you wish to.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.500
Remember when you first

14:49.875 --> 14:51.500
got here?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.417
I showed you around

14:51.542 --> 14:53.417
Griffin Rock?

14:53.458 --> 14:56.250
I took you guys to a drive in

14:53.458 --> 14:56.250
movie. What was it about?

14:56.291 --> 14:58.917
I do not recall.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.959
Sure you do.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.959
Just think.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.542
Perhaps you should go outside

15:01.000 --> 15:05.542
and play now, young Burns.

15:05.583 --> 15:08.709
Heatwave?

15:05.583 --> 15:08.709
Why can't I see your eyes?

15:08.750 --> 15:12.125
(  ominous theme playing  )

15:12.166 --> 15:16.000
Dad? I don't think anything's

15:12.166 --> 15:16.000
bothering the Bots.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.291
I don't think they are the Bots.

15:21.959 --> 15:25.125
You know who this is, of course.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.625
Optimus Prime, our leader.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.667
Top marks, Heatwave.

15:29.709 --> 15:33.333
Optimus made me your liaison

15:29.709 --> 15:33.333
on this planet.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.959
You probably don't remember,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.291
but he helped you scan

15:35.000 --> 15:37.291
your new forms

15:37.333 --> 15:39.458
for the important job

15:37.333 --> 15:39.458
you have.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.083
Will it be

15:39.500 --> 15:41.083
a rescue mission, sir?

15:41.125 --> 15:42.709
In a sense.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.667
And there are those

15:42.750 --> 15:45.667
who would thwart you in it.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.625
These dangerous criminals

15:45.709 --> 15:48.625
will stop at nothing

15:48.667 --> 15:50.625
to prevent your work.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.709
They are not

15:50.667 --> 15:52.709
to be trusted.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.125
Even the little one?

15:54.166 --> 15:56.083
Especially the little one.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.625
You are only

15:56.125 --> 15:58.625
to follow orders from me

15:58.667 --> 16:01.083
or your mission leader,

15:58.667 --> 16:01.083
Blades.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:03.959 --> 16:05.709
With all due respect, doctor,

16:05.750 --> 16:07.458
usually I lead the team.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.709
Well, this time,

16:07.500 --> 16:10.709
Optimus chose me.

16:10.750 --> 16:14.208
Unless you're questioning

16:10.750 --> 16:14.208
a Prime's direct command?

16:14.250 --> 16:15.625
( grunts )

16:17.250 --> 16:18.750
DANI:

16:17.250 --> 16:18.750
You think this'll work, Cody?

16:18.792 --> 16:22.125
There's no way the real Bots

16:18.792 --> 16:22.125
would go into the EMP zone.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.875
They know it would

16:22.166 --> 16:23.875
shut them off.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.041
So if the Bots follow

16:23.917 --> 16:27.041
our orders, they're fakes?

16:27.083 --> 16:29.583
One way to find out.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.291
Rescue Bots,

16:29.625 --> 16:32.291
enter the fenced area.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.542
As you command.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.125
(  tense theme playing  )

16:37.166 --> 16:39.917
( electricity crackling )

16:39.959 --> 16:41.625
( all powering down )

16:52.041 --> 16:53.834
GRAHAM:

16:52.041 --> 16:53.834
Wires and electronics?

16:53.875 --> 16:56.625
They're machines,

16:53.875 --> 16:56.625
not aliens.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.917
So what happened

16:56.667 --> 16:58.917
to our Bots?

16:58.959 --> 17:00.917
Somebody must have

16:58.959 --> 17:00.917
taken them.

17:00.959 --> 17:03.291
Why else build

17:00.959 --> 17:03.291
such accurate replacements?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.166
Whoever did this

17:03.333 --> 17:05.166
didn't want us

17:05.208 --> 17:07.166
to find out

17:05.208 --> 17:07.166
our partners were gone.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.625
How do we

17:07.208 --> 17:08.625
get 'em back, Dad?

17:08.667 --> 17:12.458
I'm not sure, son.

17:08.667 --> 17:12.458
I'm not sure.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.291
MADELINE:

17:12.500 --> 17:14.291
I'm tired of waiting.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.750
When can my robots

17:14.333 --> 17:16.750
start mining gold?

17:16.792 --> 17:20.000
Patience, Madeline.

17:16.792 --> 17:20.000
The Bots are ready now,

17:20.041 --> 17:23.250
but tunneling to the gold

17:20.041 --> 17:23.250
deposits will take weeks.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.500
They're completely

17:23.291 --> 17:25.500
landlocked.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.500
Good thing I bought a key.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.417
Doctor Greene's phasing device.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.125
I'm disappointed you didn't

17:30.458 --> 17:34.125
trust me to steal it for you.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.625
Trust is earned, Thaddeus.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.875
Bring me that gold,

17:36.667 --> 17:38.875
and we'll talk.

17:38.917 --> 17:42.583
I assure you,

17:38.917 --> 17:42.583
you won't be disappointed.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.458
I know. Because if I am,

17:45.500 --> 17:47.583
you'll pay for it.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.542
We've tried everything,

17:48.750 --> 17:50.542
Frankie.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.417
But the Bots' coms

17:50.583 --> 17:52.417
are off.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.625
And there's nothing

17:52.458 --> 17:55.625
on the island cameras.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.500
I'm worried that the Bots

17:55.667 --> 17:58.500
are in serious trouble.

17:58.542 --> 18:02.250
My dad can help. We'll track

17:58.542 --> 18:02.250
down the Bots, Cody. Promise.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.625
Thanks, Frankie. It's just...

18:04.667 --> 18:07.917
like losing part of my family.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.917
You know?

18:07.959 --> 18:09.667
Yeah, I do.

18:11.959 --> 18:17.000
It is time. Rescue Bots,

18:11.959 --> 18:17.000
prepare for your mission.

18:17.041 --> 18:21.208
This phasing technology will

18:17.041 --> 18:21.208
let you travel through rock.

18:21.250 --> 18:25.125
When you reach your target,

18:21.250 --> 18:25.125
collect all the gold you find.

18:25.166 --> 18:28.834
Excuse me, sir, but is there

18:25.166 --> 18:28.834
any actual rescue involved?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.417
Heatwave.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.417
Oh, yes.

18:31.458 --> 18:35.417
The humans of Earth

18:31.458 --> 18:35.417
are relying upon your success.

18:35.458 --> 18:38.041
If there are

18:35.458 --> 18:38.041
no more questions...

18:38.083 --> 18:42.000
Just follow my submarine.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:12.083 --> 19:15.709
According to the map,

19:12.083 --> 19:15.709
this is where we start digging.

19:18.834 --> 19:21.417
Blades. Don't you think

19:18.834 --> 19:21.417
it's a little strange

19:21.458 --> 19:23.875
our first mission

19:21.458 --> 19:23.875
on a new planet is mining?

19:23.917 --> 19:26.125
Perhaps gold is like Energon

19:23.917 --> 19:26.125
to the humans,

19:26.166 --> 19:28.000
their lifeblood

19:26.166 --> 19:28.000
and source of energy.

19:28.041 --> 19:32.000
I analyzed Morocco. He only has

19:28.041 --> 19:32.000
traces of gold in his system.

19:32.041 --> 19:35.291
Look, it doesn't matter

19:32.041 --> 19:35.291
why we're doing this.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.959
It's what Optimus Prime

19:35.333 --> 19:37.959
ordered.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.041
But how do you know?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.041
Did you actually speak to him?

19:41.083 --> 19:43.583
Well, no, but...

19:43.625 --> 19:46.041
I think we can trust

19:43.625 --> 19:46.041
Dr. Morocco.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.583
Hello. He's a doctor.

19:49.625 --> 19:52.542
Now let's get going already.

19:52.583 --> 19:56.375
Power up and energize.

19:56.417 --> 19:59.333
( beeping )

19:56.417 --> 19:59.333
Wait, Blades.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.750
I'm detecting the presence

19:59.375 --> 20:01.750
of methane in this chamber.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.166
One spark

20:01.792 --> 20:04.166
could cause an explosion.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.000
Well...

20:06.041 --> 20:09.291
I guess we can still

20:06.041 --> 20:09.291
follow orders carefully.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.875
(  tense theme playing  )

20:13.583 --> 20:16.333
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

20:23.083 --> 20:25.083
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:27.375 --> 20:29.375
Priscilla, darling?

20:27.375 --> 20:29.375
It's Mother.

20:29.417 --> 20:33.333
I'll be joining you in Paris

20:29.417 --> 20:33.333
a little sooner than expected.

20:37.250 --> 20:41.250
At least my investment

20:37.250 --> 20:41.250
won't be a total failure.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.709
Stay back, folks.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.709
This ground is unstable.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.000
CODY:

20:53.750 --> 20:56.000
Dad, I think someone's in there.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

21:03.166 --> 21:05.667
( grunting )

21:08.166 --> 21:09.667
Is it really them?

21:09.709 --> 21:11.959
Heatwave.

21:09.709 --> 21:11.959
You're back.

21:14.166 --> 21:17.250
It is the small criminal

21:14.166 --> 21:17.250
Dr. Morocco warned us about.

21:17.291 --> 21:20.083
What should we do?

21:17.291 --> 21:20.083
I'll take care of this.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.917
(  tense theme playing  )

21:22.959 --> 21:25.667
Heatwave, it's me. Cody.

21:25.709 --> 21:27.333
Don't you recognize me?

21:27.375 --> 21:28.959
HEATWAVE:

21:27.375 --> 21:28.959
Stay back, human.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
This is your only warning.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.500
