00:09.709 --> 00:11.917
(theme music plays)

00:19.041 --> 00:21.250
(Randy) Howard,
we are moments away

00:21.333 --> 00:24.166
from joining
the school's most elite club.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.041
(both) The Norrisville High
Moustache Society!

00:27.125 --> 00:29.542
I heard they have
a secret cafeteria.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.792
I heard they have
a full-time masseuse.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.333
I heard they have a supercomputer that'll
do your homework for you.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.959
We'll never have to
learn again.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.667
(all gasping)

00:39.750 --> 00:42.917
-Time for your fur check, Stachelings.
-(cheering)

00:43.000 --> 00:45.709
Hmm. Hmm.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.542
This is it, Howard.
This is our moment.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.125
You. Me. Together.
Stache Society.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.959
We're doin' it!
(sniffles)

00:54.041 --> 00:57.000
(sneezes)

00:57.083 --> 00:59.000
We got a smoothie here.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.709
Wow, that is weird.
Isn't that weird?

01:01.792 --> 01:03.875
My real moustache
blew off.

01:03.959 --> 01:06.709
I'll just go
grow another one.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.917
Howard, come on.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.542
Mnh-mnh.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.250
-Huh?
-Howard.

01:16.583 --> 01:17.583
(sighs)

01:19.500 --> 01:21.125
-(crash)
-Now what?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.375
Smoke bomb!

01:27.458 --> 01:29.625
Listen, I'm already having
a pretty lousy morning,

01:29.709 --> 01:31.417
so I'm just gonna take it out on you.
Cool?

01:31.500 --> 01:32.750
Cool. (shouts)

01:39.625 --> 01:42.709
Ninja chain slash.
Ninja spoke jam.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.792
You know what?
I feel better.

01:47.875 --> 01:52.625
Guess who got in the Stache Society.
(kisses)

01:52.709 --> 01:54.875
-You joined without me?
-Turns out all you gotta do

01:54.959 --> 01:56.417
is not sneeze off
your moustache.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.875
I knew we shouldn't have made our 'staches
out of your dad's back hair.

01:59.959 --> 02:01.375
I'm allergic to his cologne.

02:03.959 --> 02:05.834
<i>Ninja identified.</i>

02:07.834 --> 02:09.625
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

02:09.709 --> 02:12.625
-Why can't you just get me in?
-I totally will.

02:12.709 --> 02:15.792
Except I can't.
In order to cover my fakey-ness,

02:15.875 --> 02:19.959
I may have co-sponsored
some very strict anti-faker legislation.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.625
-You what?!
-(cell phone beeps)

02:22.709 --> 02:24.583
Can we talk about
this after lunch?

02:24.667 --> 02:28.250
I got a Stache Meeting
in the secret caf. Bushies only.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.834
Smoke bomb.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.709
What do you know?

02:39.792 --> 02:43.500
Ninja destroyed another one
of your stupid robots.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.625
Actually,
this robot succeeded.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.792
Succeeded
in getting destroyed.

02:51.709 --> 02:54.875
-(horn honks)
-Whoa! You got a license for that?

02:54.959 --> 02:59.500
The trauma to his helmet region
re-activated Ninja ID mode.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.500
I give you

03:01.583 --> 03:03.959
the face of the Ninja.

03:04.041 --> 03:06.333
Yes, finally!

03:06.417 --> 03:08.625
That's quite a push broom
the Ninja's working with.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.458
A kid with a lip warmer
like that would be

03:10.542 --> 03:14.417
in the Norrisville High
Stache Society.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.917
As the Society's
founding father,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.917
I'll just invite the gang
to a little Stache soiree.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.041
Where we'll compare each
member to this picture.

03:24.125 --> 03:28.500
And boom, Ninja captured!
Did I just come up with a plan?

03:28.583 --> 03:31.166
-I believe you did.
-Ha! In your face.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.208
Also, gonna need you
to plan a quick party for me.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.875
Something nice.

03:35.959 --> 03:37.709
So then the entomologist
says,

03:37.792 --> 03:40.625
"That's no caterpillar.
That's my moustache."

03:40.709 --> 03:45.417
(spits, laughs)
Too rich, David. Too rich.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.291
Listen, we both had
some time to cool off,

03:48.375 --> 03:49.792
and I just want you
to know

03:49.875 --> 03:53.166
I'm totally cool with you quitting
the Stache Society.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.834
I'm not quitting. You're just mad
'cause I got in and you didn't.

03:56.917 --> 04:00.375
Exactly. You have no
idea how this feels.

04:00.458 --> 04:03.875
I have no idea how it feels
to have my best friend run off

04:03.959 --> 04:06.625
-and do something awesome without me?
-You really don't.

04:06.709 --> 04:09.709
Howard, did you hear?
The Society has been invited

04:09.792 --> 04:11.917
to a party
on McFist's hover yacht.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.750
You can't go to a party
on McFist's hover yacht.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.625
Actually, I can.
Because I was invited.

04:17.709 --> 04:21.041
Come, David. We shouldn't
be discussing this in front of a smoothie.

04:21.917 --> 04:23.667
(scoffs)

04:23.750 --> 04:27.166
Ninja Nomicon, I have to
get into that party.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.834
Not because I'm jealous.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.625
Because it's on McFist's yacht
and there could be trouble.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.583
But they'll be on
the lookout for fakies.

04:33.667 --> 04:37.667
I need a disguise,
one I won't sneeze off.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.750
(screams)

04:41.875 --> 04:44.125
"The Art of Disguise."

04:44.208 --> 04:46.250
A master can alter
his physical appearance

04:46.333 --> 04:48.291
by focusing
his Ninja energy.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.500
Ninja energy equals
sick 'stache.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.208
"But be warned. Lose focus
and the energy will master the Ninja."

04:55.291 --> 04:57.291
Got it. Fine. Great.
Let's do this.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.208
Focusing Ninja energy

04:59.291 --> 05:02.000
on wicked lip strip.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.625
(grunting)

05:04.625 --> 05:06.667
<i>Focus...</i>

05:06.750 --> 05:08.625
<i>You're doing it. Focus.</i>

05:10.375 --> 05:13.417
Ha ha ha!
I'm a 'stache master.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.500
(grunting continues)

05:26.208 --> 05:28.667
And a good moustache
to you, sir.

05:28.750 --> 05:29.917
You can't go in there.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.291
<i>Focus, Cunningham.</i>

05:33.458 --> 05:35.750
Without one of these.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.041
Enjoy.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.709
(clinks)

05:48.208 --> 05:50.625
I can't believe my
old jacket still fits.

05:50.709 --> 05:53.375
I haven't gained a pound
since high school.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.000
Looking good, sir.

05:55.083 --> 05:58.917
Give me that. I'll find the Ninja.
You prepare the torture room.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.917
Will do.
Right after I get a sundae.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.458
No! First torture room,
then sundae.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.959
All I wanted was a little
ice cream and some fudge.

06:07.041 --> 06:10.583
Ooh, shrimp cocktail.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.083
Go find this guy.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.834
Howard, did you get
your free McFuzz Buzzer?

06:19.917 --> 06:21.792
It's a superior
whisker whacker.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.583
Man, I hate shaving.

06:23.667 --> 06:24.917
Wish I didn't have to do it so often,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.083
but the hair keeps growing
right out of my face.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.959
-Good evening, stache-migos.
-(gasps)

06:30.208 --> 06:32.375
You just had to come.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.083
You couldn't stand the idea of me
having fun at a party without you.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.542
Howard, that's ridiculous.

06:38.625 --> 06:41.583
You could never have fun
at a party without me.

06:41.667 --> 06:45.000
Chillin' with a convicted fakie
is a kick-outable offense.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.750
-You have to leave now.
-Make me.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.667
(blows whistle)
Fakie! We got a fakie here!

06:52.750 --> 06:55.583
-You're ratting me out?
-You brought this on yourself.

06:55.667 --> 06:59.625
<i>Focus.</i>
<i>Don't lose control.</i>

06:59.709 --> 07:01.458
Hey, you're that Smoothie
from earlier.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.834
You don't belong here.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.417
What's with all the ruckus?

07:04.500 --> 07:07.542
It appears we have
a fakie onboard.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.750
Don't worry.
I took care of it.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.083
Why do you have
a picture of me?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.959
Hmmm! We got a match.

07:20.041 --> 07:23.500
Oh, did I say that's me?
That's not me. It's not me!

07:23.583 --> 07:25.625
Terribly sorry about this,
Mr. Cunningham.

07:25.709 --> 07:29.709
I don't know how we could have mistaken
a boss stache like that for a fakey.

07:29.792 --> 07:32.458
Think nothing of it, Harry.
Innocent mistake.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.625
Now who do I see about getting
fitted for a pinkie ring?

07:35.709 --> 07:38.709
Let me go.
I'm not a fakie!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.291
Weinerman's a fakie?

07:40.375 --> 07:43.208
Huh? Guess you'll have to kick him out
of the Society then, won't you?

07:43.291 --> 07:45.166
Yeah, after we shave
off his eyebrows.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.959
(gasps) But those
things don't grow back.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.291
Howard, what have I done?

07:51.041 --> 07:53.250
Yes. We got him.
My plan worked!

07:53.333 --> 07:56.625
You're right, my biker-bot lured,
fought and identified the Ninja.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.709
Plus, I threw together this shindig
last minute with no help from you.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.125
But yeah,
your plan worked.

08:02.208 --> 08:06.291
So you're saying
my plan worked. Yes.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.834
This party is a trap
for the Ninja.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.875
And Howard said
I wasn't invited.

08:10.959 --> 08:12.709
This whole thing is for me.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.709
OK, fine, I'm a fakie.
Don't kick me out.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.291
This is my thing.
I finally got a thing.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.709
-(crying)
-What's he whimpering about?

08:20.792 --> 08:23.542
I believe he's saying
his moustache isn't real.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.375
The Ninja's a fakie?

08:25.458 --> 08:27.917
Shave his eyebrows
then destroy him.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.208
-(whirring)
-Oh, please.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.083
I come from
a very hairy people.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.083
It won't be long before
I can grow a real 'stache.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.000
Just please leave
my brows alone!

08:39.125 --> 08:40.166
Smoke bomb!

08:43.792 --> 08:45.417
Ninja?!

08:45.500 --> 08:48.417
Huh. So much
for your plan.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.125
Luckily, I always
have a Plan "B."

08:52.208 --> 08:53.291
(snarling)

09:09.709 --> 09:11.792
-Ninja fetching ball!
-(squeaks)

09:11.875 --> 09:14.875
(yelping)

09:19.583 --> 09:21.792
(grunting)

09:26.875 --> 09:30.375
-That was awesome. And so gross.
-Get outta here.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.417
Listen, I think maybe this Stache Society
thing got a little out of...

09:33.500 --> 09:35.083
Would you go?

09:36.166 --> 09:38.709
-(pants) Oh!
-Got him!

09:38.792 --> 09:40.500
Not good.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.208
This is it, Viceroy.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.834
Can't be it.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.166
Are you gonna de-mask
him or not?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.333
I'm savoring the moment.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.250
(gasps)

09:56.333 --> 09:59.458
-Ew! Oh, dear.
-(Viceroy gasps)

09:59.542 --> 10:01.166
The Ninja's got dog face.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.917
Dog face?
I lost control.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.792
You can't tell who I am.
This is perfect!

10:06.875 --> 10:08.709
-Shave him.
-(gulps)

10:08.792 --> 10:10.917
(cackling)

10:11.000 --> 10:14.083
<i>Focus energy.</i>

10:14.166 --> 10:16.250
My McFuzz Buzzer!

10:16.333 --> 10:20.166
I'm just gonna take a little
off the top of your neck.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.333
Beard block.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.875
-'Stache slap.
-(groans)

10:26.959 --> 10:28.875
Ninja facial hair escape.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.333
Sorry, McFist.
Hair today, gone to...

10:33.417 --> 10:34.792
I can't even finish that.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.125
Smoke bomb.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.792
I always hated this plan.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.834
Howard, I did some heavy thinking last
night, and I get what you were saying.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.792
I'm the Ninja.
That's my thing.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.166
But when you got your own
thing, I lost my cheese.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.583
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.834
I guess we both learned
something.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.500
You're an inconsiderate
shoob,

10:51.583 --> 10:54.542
and never apply a fake moustache
with McStick-It Mega Glue.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.875
Wow, that's really
stuck on there.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.417
Wait. No.
Don't you...

10:58.500 --> 10:59.750
-(screams)
-Oops.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.166
I think I took
a little lip with it.

We gotta get in his crew.

Cunningham... Once again
something mind-blowing happens

11:36.667 --> 11:38.750
and you're in that stupid book.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.542
This is why I don't read.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.291
OK, OK. I got it.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.709
Here goes.
"Stay grounded, do not waver.

11:47.792 --> 11:51.208
The dirt itself
will pay you a favor.

11:51.291 --> 11:54.083
To stop...
uh, your enemies..."

11:54.166 --> 11:57.417
Agh! I knew it was "foes."
So close.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.875
(exhales)

11:58.959 --> 12:00.709
"Stay grounded, do not waver.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.750
The dirt itself will
pay you a favor.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.750
To stop your foes
and hold them back,

12:04.834 --> 12:06.834
harness the soil
for an Earth attack."

12:06.917 --> 12:09.709
(grunting)

12:17.709 --> 12:20.500
So honkin' Bruce!

12:20.583 --> 12:23.125
"Words can be more
powerful than the sword."

12:23.208 --> 12:24.875
Words, really?

12:24.959 --> 12:27.542
'Cause I've never stabbed
a robo-lizard with a word.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.959
-(loud rumbling)
-Oh! Just saying. Whoa!

12:30.041 --> 12:32.917
I'm up! I'm up.
What did I miss?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.792
Only everything.

12:34.875 --> 12:38.375
You and I are joining
Rudd Rhymez's posse.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.250
Posse?
OK, yeah, totally.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.667
Let's posse. Just hand me
the Nomicon and we'll...

12:43.750 --> 12:47.125
Oh, no. Until we're in that crew,
this book stays with me.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.750
Howard, you know I can't let
you do that. Give me the book.

12:49.834 --> 12:53.834
I'll give you the book when you pry it
from my cold, greasy hands.

12:55.667 --> 12:56.750
Oops.

12:59.750 --> 13:03.208
Aww. I was just about to get
my drink on and my snack on.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.750
Looks like the snack's
on you. What-what!

13:05.834 --> 13:08.875
Not cool,
Tiny Timmy Scratch-It.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.583
Hey, Rhymez.
Randy Cunningham. 9th grader.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.208
Listen, I'm so sorry about your hoodie,
but that's my book.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.542
-Your book?
-Uh-huh. Sure is.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.834
-See, my friend Howard...
-That's me. Howard Weinerman.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.875
Big fan.
BTW, any openings in your posse?

13:21.959 --> 13:24.583
What I'm trying to say,
that's my book on your tray.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.792
First you splatter me,
then you rhyme at me?

13:26.875 --> 13:28.500
No, that wasn't supposed
to be a rhyme.

13:28.583 --> 13:31.208
And I said I was sorry
I covered you with slime.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.375
Ahh! Accident.
That was an accident.

13:33.458 --> 13:36.625
Ooh, it is on like kettle corn.

13:36.709 --> 13:39.625
You want your book?
You're gonna have to battle me for it.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.250
Yeah! Battle him, son.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.166
You ain't in my crew.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.834
Right.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.208
Amphitheater.
Ten minutes, punk!

13:47.291 --> 13:51.291
Rap battle.
What-what!

13:51.375 --> 13:54.583
And when we're through,
won't be nothin' left of your crew.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.625
FYI. You're in his crew.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.208
Your crew stinks, Cunningham.

14:00.291 --> 14:03.792
Hey, you think my pants
got enough sag?

14:03.875 --> 14:05.917
Howard, I don't have time
to worry about your sag.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I gotta break off
some serious lyrics.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.333
Quick, quick, quick,
what rhymes with "economic downturn"?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.542
I need saggier pants.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.083
-(cheering)
-What up, "N" to the "V"

14:15.166 --> 14:16.291
to the Double "LE"?

14:16.375 --> 14:20.000
Hizzle-dizzle me-casting
live from "Word War One."

14:20.083 --> 14:23.166
Maybe I should just ninja out
and steal the book back.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.750
No. If we don't show,
we lose all the cred we have,

14:25.834 --> 14:28.709
which might I remind you,
is no cred.

14:28.792 --> 14:29.959
We will have negative cred.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.166
Give it up for
the future losers...

14:32.250 --> 14:36.208
my brothetic brother Howard
and his bestie Rudy.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.750
What's the name of your crew?

14:37.834 --> 14:40.250
Uh... we're... uh...

14:40.333 --> 14:43.625
-2 Live Shoob.
-2 Live Shoob?!

14:43.709 --> 14:45.291
Yeah, it sounded cooler
in my head.

14:45.375 --> 14:48.166
Aw, yeah.
It's Rhymez times.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.750
(hip hop music playing)

14:49.834 --> 14:52.709
-Scratch it, Scratch-It.

15:01.041 --> 15:04.000
2 Live Shoob up
in this piece.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.917
You want the rhymes?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.667
You can't handle
the rhymes...

15:08.750 --> 15:10.667
of... Randy Cunningham.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.166
Here you go, buddy.
I got 'em all warmed up for you.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.250
(gulps)

15:16.375 --> 15:17.667

-What are you here to say?
-I don't know.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.333
I'm blanking out.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.417
Then why did you say,
"You're here to say"?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.917
We're dying up here.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.625
And showing you the opposite
of how it's done,

15:31.709 --> 15:34.625
it's 2 Shoobs Lose.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.917
<i>"Words can be more</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:43.583

Then make something up.

-Worm.

Oh, worm, that's great.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.625
<i>♪ Worm ♪</i>
Yes! In your face, Rhymez.

16:18.709 --> 16:20.208
That just happened.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.375
-(roars)
-Worm!

16:22.458 --> 16:24.959
-(gasps)
-(both scream)

16:25.041 --> 16:27.500
(all screaming)

16:27.583 --> 16:31.083
Oh, that's what it meant
by "powerful."

16:31.166 --> 16:33.667
I wanted to give you
your book back, but I can't.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.291
Because you're a buster.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.250
And you rhyme like
a buster, Buster.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.125
(screaming)

16:45.375 --> 16:47.917
It ate the Nomi...
my math book.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.291
And Timmy.
That's bad too.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.709
No, not Timmy.

16:51.792 --> 16:54.291
He was probably gonna
graduate this year.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.875
I can't help noticing
there's an opening in your posse.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.083
Just think about it.
That's all I'm asking.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.417
Where'd that worm come from?
McFist? The Sorcerer?

17:04.500 --> 17:08.208
Could be, could be, but I
think maybe I caused it.

17:08.291 --> 17:11.208
Should have known.
This is classic Cunningham.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.792
I choked. I thought of the first rhyme
that came into my head.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.667
Yo, Cunningham.
Don't even think you won, son.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.000
You're lucky that worm
came to the show, bro.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.000
You'll pay when we get
Timmy back, Jack.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.750
Rhymez, can you stop rhyming
for, like, one second?

17:25.834 --> 17:28.709
Nothing can shut off my rhymes.
I do it all the times.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.250
(loud rumbling)

17:30.333 --> 17:32.625
(Rhymez)
Somebody turn in my book report!

17:32.709 --> 17:34.542
(both) Hmm?

17:34.625 --> 17:37.625
Cunningham, why did it just
eat Rhymez and his crew?

17:37.709 --> 17:40.500
I think it's defending me
'cause I conjured it.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.834
Oh, so that's
the Earth attack.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.750
You really shoobed
it this time.

17:45.834 --> 17:49.333
Me? You're the one who lost
the Nomicon in the first place.

17:49.417 --> 17:52.667
Yes, but everything that happened
after that is your fault.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.792
-(rumbling)
-(both grunt)

17:53.875 --> 17:56.750
You got an entire rap crew
swallowed by a giant worm.

17:56.834 --> 18:00.208
Howard, stop yelling at me.
The worm, remember?

18:00.291 --> 18:01.834
(roars)

18:01.917 --> 18:03.959
No, no, no, no,
we're not fighting.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.750
This is just a thing we do.
We're pals.

18:07.834 --> 18:10.709
It won't attack me,
so just stay close and you'll be fine.

18:13.917 --> 18:16.834
Oh! Nobody eats my crew.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.250
Ninja worm snag. Yeah!

18:24.709 --> 18:27.000
(spits)

18:27.083 --> 18:28.917
Well, that was great.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Good thing I'm not
allergic to dust.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.750
Oh, wait,
I am allergic to dust.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.834
(sneezes) This should
be a fun afternoon.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.625
Really? Are you trying
to get attacked by a worm?

18:38.709 --> 18:41.667
Oh, right. (sneezes)
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.083
(distant moaning)

18:43.166 --> 18:44.542
Ninja glow ball.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.542
Big worm just
swallowed me up.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.458
Big worm...
What-what!

18:54.875 --> 18:57.000
Get us outta here now!

18:57.083 --> 18:58.250
(screaming)

19:02.750 --> 19:06.208
Time to put
this worm on a hook.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.500
(shouting, panting)

19:12.041 --> 19:13.709
(roars)

19:15.458 --> 19:17.500
(Rhymez babbling)

19:21.417 --> 19:23.750
-What the juice?!
-(roars)

19:23.834 --> 19:25.208
Didn't work, Ninja.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.959
I mean, big thumbs up

19:29.041 --> 19:30.834
from this side
of the cave.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.417
"Words can be more powerful

19:33.500 --> 19:34.709
than the sword."

19:34.792 --> 19:36.500
Words, words.
Earth attack.

19:36.583 --> 19:39.458
If using "worm" in my
rap made you, then...

19:39.542 --> 19:41.333
To stop your foes
and hold them back,

19:41.417 --> 19:43.667
harness the soil
for an Earth attack.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.959
Time's getting tight,
so gimme a hand.

19:46.041 --> 19:49.208
To win this fight,
I need warriors of sand.

19:50.542 --> 19:53.625
Those are sand ninjas.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.208
I call 'em Sandjas.
Just made that up.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.291
(grunting)

20:00.792 --> 20:02.375
(roaring)

20:12.500 --> 20:14.333
He keeps putting himself
back together.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.041
(Ninja) What if the pieces
were too small

20:20.125 --> 20:21.667
to put back together?

20:21.750 --> 20:24.333
OK, Sandjas, not sure
what this is gonna do,

20:24.417 --> 20:27.208
but Sandja cyclone attack!

20:39.959 --> 20:42.875
-(coughing)
-(sneezes)

20:42.959 --> 20:46.834
Looks like the early Ninja
got the worm, huh?

20:46.917 --> 20:49.083
That didn't really work.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.875
Thank you, noble Sandjas.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.792
You can go now.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.875
You're done Earth attacking.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.875
Hey, one question.
If the Sandjas listen to you,

20:58.959 --> 21:02.417
why didn't you just
tell the worm to stop?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.917
Smoke bomb!

21:06.959 --> 21:10.625
I got my book back. All Rhymez wanted
was a non-rhyming apology.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.417
And I have to dry clean
his hoodie.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.959
You know, I learned
a valuable lesson today.

21:15.041 --> 21:19.041
Ninja spells are not to be used
in freestyle rap battles.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.500
It amazes me that you had
to learn that lesson.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.417
Me too, buddy.
Me too.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.458
Yo, C, we gonna
do this or what?

21:25.542 --> 21:26.917
Did you get us
in the posse?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.834
(laughs) Better.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.709
Give it up for Rhymez
and the Yo-Men,

21:30.792 --> 21:33.041
-featuring 30 Seconds to Math.
-(cheering)

21:33.125 --> 21:35.583
You know how I got eaten
by a giant worm?

21:35.667 --> 21:36.792
You're forgiven.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.125
What-what!
