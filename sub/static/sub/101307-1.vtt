WEBVTT

00:57.770 --> 01:00.770
O'Shea

01:10.189 --> 01:17.719
Hey who are you?
Your new partner. Tim Randall your... Brett

01:17.719 --> 01:20.770
O'Shea. How do you do?

01:21.530 --> 01:25.850
What do we know? Well you missed the big
speech man the coroner already told

01:25.850 --> 01:31.030
everyone time of death based on rigidity
somewhere between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.

01:31.030 --> 01:34.400
What's the cause. We don't know that yet
either?

01:34.400 --> 01:38.540
There's no discernable injuries. We got
shit from a purse thrown everywhere.

01:38.540 --> 01:46.580
There's some cash there but I don't know
this doesn't feel like a robbery. Why

01:46.580 --> 01:49.729
here?
According to her ID she lives right over there.

01:49.729 --> 01:55.700
We a uniformed officer check it out. No
one's inside nothing seem to be missing

01:55.700 --> 01:59.570
we got other guys canvass in the area
but don't worry you'll get the report

01:59.570 --> 02:11.180
tomorrow. So let's run tox analysis -
probably an OD. It's a good idea... standard

02:11.180 --> 02:20.750
procedure but hey you got it, Man. Man that wasn't no
damn OD! Oh hey hey hey BACK UP! Miss Darcy never

02:20.750 --> 02:27.230
dabbled in no shit like that!
You know who this is? Yeah... man that's miss

02:27.230 --> 02:30.020
Darcy and you know what? She was my friend.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.420
Get Back... Calm Down...

02:35.500 --> 02:45.230
You see what happened to her? Yeah I saw the whole damn
thing... she was running for her life. Sweet

02:45.230 --> 02:54.360
child.
I tried to help but I got scared

02:54.360 --> 03:02.860
Did you she was chasing her. Yep I did.
What this person looked like. Man it

03:02.860 --> 03:12.920
wasn't no damn person I mean it was a
giant ass bird man. A bird? Yeah a big-ass

03:13.300 --> 03:19.100
bird. Hold on a second like "KA-KAA KA-KAA" A bird
that's what.... get back! Get back!

03:19.840 --> 03:23.940
Thank you for your help We appreciate it.
If we need anything else we'll be sure

03:23.950 --> 03:36.580
to find you okay. Yeah I'll be around but
uh is there some kind of you know reward

03:36.580 --> 03:44.040
for this here? I mean I did help you all
out? Yeah you did yeah I'll tell you what

03:44.040 --> 03:48.640
we find a giant bird man we'll put in a
good word in the mayor for you. Get back

03:48.640 --> 03:55.890
I'm not telling you again... Go on...

04:00.250 --> 04:09.520
Well that was interesting. Good morning
Chief, you want to see me? You meet your

04:09.520 --> 04:14.760
new partner?
Any thoughts? I don't really know him yet

04:14.760 --> 04:20.500
What's the hollabaloo downtown?
Working on that now. Waiting on the

04:20.500 --> 04:26.890
coroner's report. Looks like an OD. What
do you know about her? She was a known

04:26.890 --> 04:33.010
prost, multiple arrests for it. She
lived alone. No relationship that we know

04:33.010 --> 04:39.310
of yet.
Any witnesses? Nothing solid sir. I want

04:39.310 --> 04:46.510
you to keep me posted on this. Of course.
Something I should know? It's a little too early

04:46.510 --> 04:51.040
to tell but this is the second woman
found in a week. The first one was found

04:51.040 --> 04:56.560
in an abandoned home in Sherman Hills. We
have an ID on her? Yeah she was picked up

04:56.560 --> 05:01.600
for prostitution
last month. Think they're connected? I

05:01.600 --> 05:04.870
didn't say that and don't you say it
either.

05:04.870 --> 05:08.530
I don't want the press crawling up my
ass about some serial killer stalking

05:08.530 --> 05:15.700
hookers. Yes sir... I want to ask you
something. I got a call today from John

05:15.700 --> 05:19.840
Allen's office. They say he's been trying
to reach you for the last few days. Do

05:19.840 --> 05:25.210
you know anything about that. He's called
a couple of times left a few messages

05:25.210 --> 05:32.740
about meeting. I meant to call him back.
Yeah I'm gonna need you to do that... like

05:32.740 --> 05:38.710
now. Why the rush?
Detective Des Moines likes to pretend

05:38.710 --> 05:42.510
that it's a big city but that couldn't
be further from the truth.

05:42.510 --> 05:48.850
What do you mean? I mean he's a person of influence. The
Allen family is very important to our

05:48.850 --> 05:54.730
city so if John Allen wants you to call
him back you better call him back. Yes sir

05:54.730 --> 06:02.080
I'm on it. And one more thing. That had
better be coffee in your cup! You smell

06:02.080 --> 06:09.550
like a frat house. I left the house in a hurry
this morning sir. Got a extra shirt in my

06:09.550 --> 06:11.729
office

06:22.659 --> 06:29.240
Detective O'Shea please meet me at my
home at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning we

06:29.240 --> 06:39.490
have something pressing to discuss I
look forward to our interlude John Allen

06:43.599 --> 06:46.599
Weirdo...

07:00.520 --> 07:06.050
Thought you had to work tonight.
I did but I took the night off.

07:06.050 --> 07:18.560
Oh yeah... why is that? Maybe I wanted to
see you. Really? Yeah... don't I go to your

07:18.560 --> 07:23.410
head though okay?

07:28.670 --> 07:38.730
So there is something that we need to
talk about. What is it? So I have a job

07:38.730 --> 07:46.300
interview and if I get it
it'd be look really great for me.

07:46.300 --> 07:55.040
That's all it is? That's great! Well trust me
you're gonna do fine in the interview

07:55.040 --> 07:58.030
don't worry about.

07:58.160 --> 08:09.250
It's in it's in St. Louis. .. St. Louis it's
in St. Louis. Yeah. Wow

08:09.580 --> 08:19.220
What the hell Lisa? I just I wanted to
get your thoughts okay? My thoughts?! I'm

08:19.220 --> 08:28.250
shocked I guess. I really thought we had
something here. We do okay? You know that

08:28.250 --> 08:31.940
we do. I didn't ask for this. oh so
someone from from st. Louis just

08:31.940 --> 08:38.270
randomly selected you? Hang on a minute a minute.
Hey no you know what? I won't hold you

08:38.270 --> 08:44.059
back . You decide what you want. This is
supposed to be a decision that we make

08:44.059 --> 08:50.000
together.
I mean hey maybe you could get a job on

08:50.000 --> 08:56.990
the force in St. Louis. You know I
can't do that. Can you try? I can't

08:56.990 --> 09:01.880
just quit and plus I'm the only family
my mom has left I can't just leave her

09:01.880 --> 09:14.690
by herself. I know... I just had to ask. I don't want to
lose it you. Ya know sometimes, things just

09:14.690 --> 09:20.680
just aren't meant to be. Guess this is one of them.

09:23.450 --> 09:28.910
You... you don't even want to talk about it? I
mean if we work together we can make it

09:28.910 --> 09:37.790
work right? There's nothing to talk about.
You are who you are. I am who I am. We gave it a

09:37.790 --> 09:48.830
shot. Just not in the cards. I wish you luck at
the interview Lisa. Detective O'Shea so

09:48.830 --> 09:54.440
glad you made it...
What can the Des Moines police

09:54.440 --> 09:59.140
department do for you today mr. Allen?

10:08.160 --> 10:13.540
Detective did you know that the state
has granted me access to a burial ground

10:13.540 --> 10:20.199
of an indigenous Native American tribe? I
was unaware. What does that have to do

10:20.199 --> 10:29.079
with the police department? Nothing but
what I'm about to tell you is very

10:29.079 --> 10:36.009
important. And what would that be. My goal was to retrieve artifacts from this site

10:36.009 --> 10:46.360
but what I found was a tomb. Well as
exciting as that sounds it's not really

10:46.360 --> 10:49.980
a police matter.
I'm not finished.

10:55.150 --> 11:03.350
Our city
has a problem detective. Multiple

11:03.350 --> 11:07.730
missing-persons... unexplained causes of
death. Two weeks ago an entire homeless

11:07.730 --> 11:16.660
camp... disappeared. Almost ten people
unaccounted for. Then the other night,

11:16.660 --> 11:31.130
your case, poor girl in the alley. Tell me,
you solved it yet. You know I can't talk

11:31.130 --> 11:35.049
about that.

11:38.690 --> 11:47.300
You speak to me as if you don't like me.
Have I done something to offend you you?

11:47.300 --> 11:55.770
You know what I don't like are games and I
get the feeling that you do. I don't know

11:55.770 --> 12:01.190
what you want but I've had just about
enough of this. Why am I here? Because

12:01.190 --> 12:11.942
detective, I believe there is a vampire
in Des Moines.

12:11.942 --> 12:16.920
That's why you brought me here?

12:16.920 --> 12:24.300
Don't you see? The tomb. Missing
people. And that that tells you we have a

12:24.300 --> 12:33.020
vampire? It was one other thing... There is
scripture on the tombs.

12:33.020 --> 12:41.060
it is Romanian. You really believe this
stuff don't you?

12:41.060 --> 12:50.160
Why'd you pick me? I chose you Brett
because of what you can see. I can't see

12:50.160 --> 12:52.430
anything.

12:54.080 --> 12:59.520
How is Michael?

12:59.520 --> 13:05.760
Get on the floor now! You
might not want to go waving that weapon

13:05.760 --> 13:11.007
around Sonny, unless you planning on
using it. I'm the one given the orders here now you you need to...

13:11.007 --> 13:13.560
listen up Sonny
we don't have much time.

13:13.560 --> 13:20.460
I've come to help you solve the case.
Help me what? Let me introduce myself. I'm

13:20.460 --> 13:24.600
your great-grandfather
detective Michael O'Shea and in case

13:24.600 --> 13:31.400
you're still not sure yes I was murdered
over 80 years ago...

13:39.180 --> 13:45.629
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes I think you do.

13:45.629 --> 13:50.959
I've heard things about you.

13:52.459 --> 14:01.620
You're a seer. Means you're the only one
I can trust. I want you to help me prove

14:01.620 --> 14:11.100
I'm right. Mr. Allen I'm sorry but what
you're suggesting simply not sane.

14:11.100 --> 14:23.610
This isn't about sanity. This is, I'm
afraid, a reality. One that I am sure you

14:23.610 --> 14:27.199
are well-versed face.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.980
Have a good day Mr. Allen

14:47.910 --> 14:54.430
Jesus Michael. Odd duck that one is. Can't
say that I care for him. Is there any way at all

14:54.430 --> 14:57.069
that you can maybe warn me when you show
up like that?

14:57.069 --> 15:01.329
Oh sure Sonny, maybe next time I'll send
you a telegram from the afterlife. That's

15:01.329 --> 15:06.639
funny. That's real funny. What are you
doing here, huh? More importantly why are

15:06.639 --> 15:08.889
you bac k?
I figured you'd be dancing through the

15:08.889 --> 15:14.290
pearly gates by now. Well forgive me for
caring but when I see my great-grandson

15:14.290 --> 15:19.480
in despair I feel compelled to step in.
I'm not in despair. Well from where I sit

15:19.480 --> 15:24.100
things don't look good. Bodies are
stacking up. Your best girl is leaving

15:24.100 --> 15:28.779
town, you've got a crazy millionaire
conjurer vampires. All right all right I

15:28.779 --> 15:38.120
get it.

15:38.120 --> 15:49.829
O' Shay a word please. Yes sir. I take it
you called Alan? As a matter of fact I

15:49.829 --> 15:59.269
just left his house and not exactly sure
how to say this sir. I prefer English.

15:59.269 --> 16:09.769
He's convinced that there's a vampire in
Des Moines. Shut the door.

16:14.839 --> 16:20.790
What in the hell are you talking about?
Apparently he's found a tomb in a dig

16:20.790 --> 16:25.769
site. Between that and the missing bodies...
lately.... a vampire.

16:25.769 --> 16:31.170
Well Jesus in the outfield, he really is
nuttier than squirrel crap. I have a

16:31.170 --> 16:37.800
feeling something isn't right with him.
You think? What I mean is, he seems to

16:37.800 --> 16:41.220
know a lot about things that he
shouldn't. I told you he's a very

16:41.220 --> 16:48.120
influential person. Right I'll write up
the report and do the tea ASAP. Sounds

16:48.120 --> 16:51.360
good.
Be thorough! I don't want this to

16:51.360 --> 16:55.040
come back and bite us in the ass later.

17:00.170 --> 17:05.760
What's the verdict? Death by Exsanguination. What? It means drained of

17:05.760 --> 17:09.839
blood. Yeah I know what it means but why?
How? I thought, I thought there were no marks

17:09.839 --> 17:13.200
on the body.
I know, I know, The coroner misspoke. It

17:13.200 --> 17:17.220
looks like two puncture marks on the
base of the neck just inside the

17:17.220 --> 17:22.770
hairline. Are you shitting me? Yeah.
According to her body weight she should

17:22.770 --> 17:27.589
have had five liters of blood in her
body but she only had one and a half.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.300
This is not good. I know.

18:12.960 --> 18:20.900
What are you doing here Lisa? Good Morning...

18:22.990 --> 18:33.110
I thought I might catch you before work. Can I come in? No.
Is there someone in there with you?

18:33.110 --> 18:37.090
None of your business and we don't answer to each other anymore.

18:37.090 --> 18:43.269
We need to Talk. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

18:43.299 --> 18:52.220
Brett, you've been drinking again haven't
you? Lisa you need to leave. Look I just...

18:52.220 --> 18:55.899
Just go please

19:03.700 --> 19:09.940
Hey Brett. Brett can I talk to you for a
second.

19:09.980 --> 19:15.000
Look man this is the second time this
week you've shown up smelling like a

19:15.000 --> 19:17.580
strip club mop bucket what's going on
man?

19:17.580 --> 19:26.940
I smell like the strip club? What? Come on man,
let this go with the heartfelt apology

19:26.940 --> 19:30.899
huh?
Hey, the other guys and I we've been here for

19:30.899 --> 19:34.649
hours. I'm just telling you it does not
look good if you keep showing up late

19:34.649 --> 19:38.820
like that all right? I'm just trying to
help you out man. How about you just tell

19:38.820 --> 19:44.669
me what's going on? Well we don't know
anything about blood loss yet but we did

19:44.669 --> 19:49.049
find two puncture holes on the base of
the neck just like the last one. Park

19:49.049 --> 19:53.610
ranger found her. You got no other
eyewitnesses. No tracks. She didn't have a

19:53.610 --> 20:00.570
cellphone on her and we don't have any
surveillance cameras so we got dick.

20:00.570 --> 20:07.559
How the hell'd she end up out here. There's
no one for miles and miles. How the hell

20:07.559 --> 20:11.340
is a tree get all twisted like that? I
got a couple theories if you want to

20:11.340 --> 20:16.679
hear them. Please. One she was killed
somewhere else dumped here postmortem.

20:16.679 --> 20:23.380
That's one. What's the other one? This
gets crazy...

20:23.380 --> 20:29.330
So far we count about six compound
fractures not including a nearly crushed

20:29.330 --> 20:35.690
skull. What's that tell you? Looks like
she was ran over. It's a possibility but

20:35.690 --> 20:39.850
her injuries seem to be more consistent
with a fall.

20:43.279 --> 20:47.919
I don't think she fell. What are you thinking?
I think she was dropped.

20:47.919 --> 20:57.160
Come in. Shut the door detective.

21:00.410 --> 21:09.410
Brett, this is Luther Dennett. He's from
the mayor's office.Mayor Winston's

21:09.410 --> 21:14.060
office received a call late yesterday
afternoon. It was reported that you had

21:14.060 --> 21:22.340
words- threatened John Allen in his home.
in addition, that you had a very animated

21:22.340 --> 21:27.320
argument on the premises with yourself.
What do you have to say about that

21:27.320 --> 21:34.220
detective? I say that simply is not true. I'll admit
that I strongly disagreed with Mr. Allen

21:34.220 --> 21:39.620
but I in no way confronted or threatened
the man. What about the argument?

21:39.620 --> 21:46.870
Honestly I have no idea what he's talking about. Are you
sure? I'm pretty sure.

21:51.650 --> 21:58.400
Security surveillance cameras recorded
footage of you in the car and as you can

21:58.400 --> 22:08.330
see it is quite contradictory to what
you just stated. Chief Andrews you'll no

22:08.330 --> 22:14.920
doubt have a chat with Detective O'Shea?

22:14.980 --> 22:20.510
Yeah. I must get going.
The Mayor is very much looking forward

22:20.510 --> 22:28.480
to updates on all this later today. We
shall talk soon.

22:34.149 --> 22:38.919
What in the hell are you doing? Sir ... Where
were you this morning? You show up to a

22:38.919 --> 22:44.799
crime scene an hour after first call? Sir.
Shut up Brett. I am sick of your

22:44.799 --> 22:48.639
shit. I am ready to bust your ass back
down to traffic. Sir. Are you cracking up?

22:48.639 --> 22:53.679
What was that shit in the car? And for
God's sakes you pick the Allen family to

22:53.679 --> 22:59.859
show you ass? I didn't know I was being recorded, Sir.
His employee said he saw the whole

22:59.859 --> 23:02.889
thing!
So even if you're telling the truth now

23:02.889 --> 23:06.429
that you've lied about talking to
yourself, no one's going to believe you!

23:06.429 --> 23:16.420
Jesus I know how bad this looks okay, Go
home. What? I said go home! You suspending me?

23:16.420 --> 23:23.709
Wow! Maybe you are a detective. Go home. Shave. Iron your goddamn clothes. Dry up

23:23.709 --> 23:27.879
and brush your teeth And if I decide to bring
you back you show up looking like you

23:27.879 --> 23:32.069
belong to the goddamn Des Moines police
department.

23:33.429 --> 23:42.230
Brett there are no final straws, no
second chances, no Mulligan's. You screw

23:42.230 --> 23:47.230
up again and you're done. Now get the
hell out of here.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.559
Well you got yourself a real shite
sandwich on your plate now don't you,

24:06.559 --> 24:10.159
Sonny?
Yeah no thanks to you. My advice... I didn't

24:10.159 --> 24:14.299
ask. Well if you're getting it anyway. You
know your guts telling you that

24:14.299 --> 24:18.049
something unnatural is going on here.
I can't be certain of anything. You have seen the

24:18.049 --> 24:22.639
facts. Just because a body is drained of
blood, doesn't mean there are Romanian

24:22.639 --> 24:27.860
vampires. You said the woman was dropped.
From what? I don't know. Well you better

24:27.860 --> 24:40.690
figure it out Sonny. I'm tryingI O'Shea

24:42.540 --> 24:49.850
Well send it to Anders. I'm home for a
few days. Thanks for calling.

24:52.670 --> 24:58.139
Yeah?
Who is this?

24:59.090 --> 25:06.740
What can I do for you sir?

25:06.740 --> 25:10.220
Thank you for meeting me.

25:12.470 --> 25:19.860
That's Alright. Tell me about Darcy. She was a real nice
lady. You know? She gave me food, give me

25:19.860 --> 25:30.080
cigarettes. How long did you know her? A
long time- long time. What's wrong?

25:30.080 --> 25:37.050
You see them people over there? Look at me
like I'm some kind of rat. You know. Some kind a

25:37.050 --> 25:41.630
monster. They don't know I used to be
somebody.

25:41.630 --> 25:50.220
What'd you do? I play a violin. New
York. London. Rome, man world. What

25:50.220 --> 26:03.580
happened? I was married and uh
my wife died okay and and my son too - it

26:03.580 --> 26:07.870
was a car accident.
I was I was in Berlin and I had to

26:07.870 --> 26:11.590
fly home man cuz I just couldn't
concentrate no more you know it's like I

26:11.590 --> 26:14.950
couldn't hear the songs in my head you
know because all I kept seeing their

26:14.950 --> 26:20.769
faces. Im so sorry.
That's terrible. Man it's alright it's alright

26:20.769 --> 26:26.590
it's alright. See miss Darcy never
nood it out with somebody neither but she

26:26.590 --> 26:33.250
always treated me like she did. When
you called, you said you knew something. Oh

26:33.250 --> 26:38.409
right right right. So she told me she met
this old cat at the club that she worked

26:38.409 --> 26:45.970
at. He had a lot of money to dress
nice but she said it was weird but he

26:45.970 --> 26:50.799
gave a lot of money so she stuck around.
Did she say what he looked like?

26:50.799 --> 26:59.950
Mention his name? Yeah. Victor. His name was
Victor and he spoke with that accent. Do

26:59.950 --> 27:04.000
you think that this Victor guy is the
Birdman? I know that for a fact

27:04.000 --> 27:08.950
and Miss Darcy did too. You said on the
phone you know where he likes to go. Can

27:08.950 --> 27:13.750
you take me there? Hell no and I ain't
going in there. But miss Darcy did tell

27:13.750 --> 27:20.159
me where it is. And you best not go in
there alone. I like you sir

27:20.159 --> 27:24.960
because you look at me the same way miss
Darcy did.

27:50.130 --> 27:58.980
Hey mister! What? What are you doing? It's
official police business kid now beat it.

27:58.980 --> 28:08.140
You ain't no cop. That ain't even real.
See a lot of badges in your day kid? No

28:08.140 --> 28:11.380
cop comes around here by himself. If
you're real cop

28:11.380 --> 28:15.340
where's your partner? You ever see
anything funny going on around this

28:15.340 --> 28:20.680
house? Everything around here is funny
dumbass. What I mean is you ever see any

28:20.680 --> 28:27.520
people that look like they don't belong?
You mean dressed up? Sure. Some nights.

28:27.520 --> 28:33.160
late this guy shows up with his lady
friends a couple of big boys too. Same

28:33.160 --> 28:40.540
women too? Sometimes. sometimes not. You
ever hear anything weird coming from

28:40.540 --> 28:49.080
here ? I'm done talking. Hey hey someone's
in trouble you got to let me know.

28:49.740 --> 28:58.240
Sometimes I hear things. What things?
Screams... lady screams. Did you ever tell

28:58.240 --> 29:06.420
anybody? Nobody hears me. Hey hey I hear
you okay? And I'm gonna make it stop.

29:06.810 --> 29:12.090
It happens every third night.
It'll happen tonight. Then I'll be back.

29:12.090 --> 29:15.360
See you later...

30:13.220 --> 30:20.610
Sir look. This is not how suspension
works O'Shea. I know it just look some

30:20.610 --> 30:24.810
information came my way and if it's true
it's time-sensitive. You better convinced

30:24.810 --> 30:28.350
me with a quickness that you were not
working a case while being disciplined.

30:28.350 --> 30:32.160
Someone called me and gave me an address.
I take it you're talking about this

30:32.160 --> 30:36.630
homeless man that keeps calling. Yeah.
Well besides the fact that he's insane.

30:36.630 --> 30:41.160
I still sent detective Navarro over
there. There is nothing to it.

30:41.160 --> 30:47.580
Now get out of here. There was a kid. Did
you see this kid at the house? Tell me

30:47.580 --> 30:51.810
you did not go to that house! Sir look. I
don't want to see your face now get out

30:51.810 --> 30:54.590
of here before I have you arrested!

31:03.780 --> 31:16.180
Hey. What are you doing here Lisa? I came to say goodbye. Good luck!
do you not care it all? You'll get it at all

31:16.180 --> 31:23.320
do you? If it were up to me you wouldn't go.
But all you care about your work so go.

31:23.320 --> 31:29.050
But do me a favor and stop coming around
here .I don't want to see you anymore.

31:29.050 --> 31:33.970
you know what? For the record I never wanted to go without you
but you gave up on us so fast. I never

31:33.970 --> 31:37.450
gave up.
You should have supported me. We could

31:37.450 --> 31:42.880
have worked it out together but it's all
about you Brett, You know what you're right. I don't care.

31:43.380 --> 31:49.120
Good luck. Brett you're an asshole okay! I can't believe you.

31:56.140 --> 33:10.500
--Eerie music plays---

33:10.500 --> 33:11.840
Three Gunshots -- BOOM BOOm BOOM

33:11.840 --> 33:16.520
-High pitched animal howl!!

33:16.520 --> 33:32.980
- Bretts Heavy Breathing--

33:41.660 --> 33:43.400
Brett- What the hell is going here? GET ME OUT OF HERE!

33:43.400 --> 33:45.400
Is it still here? I don't Know!

33:45.400 --> 33:49.360
Tell me you saw it! Say it! I don't know what I saw.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
Get some backbone.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.900
Shut your mouth. I should lkeave you here for lying about me. I can fix that!

33:54.900 --> 33:56.900
You can't fix shit!

33:56.900 --> 33:58.900
There have been gunshots. In a few seconds there are gonna be

33:59.100 --> 34:03.520
dozens of officers here. Now you just
saved my life.

34:03.520 --> 34:09.590
You deserve reinstatement
effective immediately or your ineptitude

34:09.590 --> 34:14.000
is the reason Terrence is gone upstairs
you shouldn't even be here. What do you

34:14.000 --> 34:20.420
want? I want your word you're gonna help
me catch this vampire! If you

34:20.420 --> 34:24.530
agree you're back on the force
Heralded as a hero here before your head

34:24.530 --> 34:29.000
hits the pillow tonight. It's not, stop
thinking about your career and start

34:29.000 --> 34:31.870
thinking about prison.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.870
Why cant you just leave me alone, HUH?

34:33.870 --> 34:40.320
Because detective. I know you have a special gift. And we are going to need it if we are going to catch this thing.

34:43.699 --> 34:46.420
You'd better hurry!

34:49.500 --> 34:55.900
The Mayor made me promise to thank you
his behalf and quick thinking. You are a

34:55.900 --> 35:01.630
hero detective O'Shea. The mayor's ask
that you reinstate the detective

35:01.630 --> 35:07.620
immediately. He would like Brett to head
the investigation from here on out.

35:07.620 --> 35:12.340
Detective you have the complete support
of the Mayor and we'd like to extend you

35:12.340 --> 35:20.530
any resources you need. Those will be
readily available chief Anders. Of course!

35:20.530 --> 35:24.790
I suggest you go home and get a few
hours of sleep.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.520
The city's got a killer on the loose and
he needs to be stopped.

35:29.520 --> 35:37.800
Prove the mayor right. He's chosen you.
Catch this lunatic. Yes sir!

35:39.060 --> 35:40.620
Very good.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.700
I don't know what you're into but I'm

35:46.960 --> 35:54.820
going to be watching you very carefully.
Good night sir.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.860
You think she'll be back?

36:04.840 --> 36:15.160
I'm afraid you have bigger fish to fry
now Sonny. What's wrong? That boy that you

36:15.160 --> 36:17.640
talked with yesterday.

36:17.940 --> 36:22.300
He's been dead for
five days.

36:25.080 --> 36:30.480
Face it Sonny , I'm not the only man you can talk to

36:45.690 --> 36:53.880
I see that you irritated John Allen. Are
you trying to cause trouble? Trying to be

36:53.880 --> 36:57.120
honest.
Allen doesn't like the truth. Well he's

36:57.120 --> 37:00.100
calling me now.
Sorry. I'll reach out to him.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.340
Vampires?

37:03.520 --> 37:07.580
I don't think John Allen's elevator goes
all the way to the top floor, what do you

37:07.590 --> 37:13.020
think? About Allen? No, about socks with
sandals, about vampires what do you think

37:13.020 --> 37:20.540
about vampires?
I want daily reports.

37:20.540 --> 37:43.760
-Tense background Music

37:47.520 --> 37:49.520
What's all this?

37:49.680 --> 37:54.840
I want you to get your crap and leave.
I really give a shit what you want. If

37:54.840 --> 38:01.619
you have a problem you can take a walk.
I've put up with your lies and perverted shit for years.

38:01.619 --> 38:08.930
Im not gonna go around pretending that we have a happy and
normal marriage. Don't even start with

38:08.930 --> 38:10.790
you knew what I liked before we got married.

38:10.800 --> 38:18.720
it's just like you! I always give you what you want and never give what I need.

38:18.720 --> 38:24.560
I can't stand you. Then LEAVE. I can't afford to leave. You wanted a divorce, you should have thought about that.

38:26.080 --> 38:30.880
I talked to a lawyer. He said I'll get the house and half of your pension.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.880
Oh you did? Well that's really smart.

38:33.840 --> 38:39.920
you should have thought about this... I would never in a million
years like you stay here. I'd rather burn

38:39.920 --> 38:42.040
this place to the ground. And you know that.

38:42.040 --> 38:49.200
That is what I thought you'd say so I recorded it with my cell. You better not touch this house unless its to mow the lawn.

38:50.320 --> 38:54.240
ok alright
What happened? We can talk about this.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.560
What happened? Don't you dare do that.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.920
What?

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
Pretend that you are human.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.920
Get out NOW!

39:03.400 --> 39:05.400
Get out!

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
GET OUT! GO!

39:10.440 --> 39:17.400
O'Sheat take a look at this what do you
see? We know she is?

39:17.400 --> 39:26.080
Ramona Smith, a known prostitute, She
usually works the downtown area. What do

39:26.099 --> 39:31.440
you think? We should have the coroner's
report in a few hours. I'd like you to

39:31.440 --> 39:36.180
check this out and keep me updated
sir I was under the impression they were

39:36.180 --> 39:40.619
already detectives assigned to this case.
I decided I'd like your input or do you

39:40.619 --> 39:44.190
have better things to do O'Shea? hey, I don't wanna step on anyone's

39:44.190 --> 39:49.140
toes that all. You're stepping on my
toes right now. Get out there and take a

39:49.140 --> 39:52.859
look around see if this looks like
anything that you seem lately. Can you

39:52.859 --> 39:54.600
handle that?

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
Right away Sir.

40:03.720 --> 40:11.160
God... I forgot something I'm sorry I'll be
right back. I'll be in the car. Okay.

40:12.240 --> 40:18.360
Jesus, what are you doing here? I thought you were
upset so I came to check things out what

40:18.380 --> 40:23.240
the hell happened to her. That's what I'm
trying to figure out. This just happened

40:23.240 --> 40:25.520
to other women? Yes.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.120
I think Des Moines
has another problem. Well I'm one step

40:30.360 --> 40:35.660
ahead of you. Call me crazy but I keep
going back to Alan's concern and there's

40:35.660 --> 40:42.250
a witness claimed it was a bird man.
Birdman? Yeah...

40:47.430 --> 40:52.230
Are you surprised that all the attention
this case is getting I mean she's just a

40:52.230 --> 40:57.809
dirty hooker I don't get it Why don't
you show a little respect for the dead

40:57.809 --> 41:02.069
huh? You know if someone's daughter. Oh
come on don't tell me your bleeding

41:02.069 --> 41:06.869
heart now. All I'm saying is it doesn't
matter what she did to make a living no

41:06.869 --> 41:10.049
one deserves to have their throat ripped
out like that okay don't need to be a

41:10.049 --> 41:15.539
dick about it. Hey cool down I hear you. I
forgot you're new at this don't worry we

41:15.539 --> 41:19.010
all start off a little self-righteous
our first year. I'm not being

41:19.010 --> 41:24.390
self-righteous. I'm being human and we
don't have a problem as long as you keep

41:24.390 --> 41:30.270
your mouth shut Hey you got some nerve
talking to me like that buddy. You know

41:30.270 --> 41:34.920
respect goes both ways. You know maybe
it's not a good idea for you to piss on

41:34.920 --> 41:39.180
the guy who's watching your back. Are you
threatening me?

41:39.180 --> 41:43.410
You take that however you want. A word
around the campfire is is you know how

41:43.410 --> 41:48.119
to pull the plug off the bottle better
than anyone. You know maybe that's how an

41:48.119 --> 41:56.849
accident can happen. Don't get too full
of yourself there buddy.

41:56.849 --> 42:01.079
Morning... I'm Detective Bret O'Shea with the Des
Moines police department. I know you were

42:01.079 --> 42:04.500
interviewed earlier but thought I'd stop
by and introduce myself.

42:04.500 --> 42:09.029
See if you thought anything else? I've
already given my statement, nothing's

42:09.029 --> 42:15.450
changed. Well that was someone else. This is
my case now. Think of anything else see

42:15.450 --> 42:21.230
anything get ahold of me. You know I'm
not surprised there was a murder here.

42:21.230 --> 42:26.779
It's get to the point where decent
folks can't take a walk at night anymore.

42:26.779 --> 42:32.849
When you found the body
Did you touch it at all it'll? Make sure

42:32.849 --> 42:39.059
it was dead? No, no I did not I almost
threw up and I got myself together and I

42:39.059 --> 42:47.700
called you guys. See anyone ? Hear a car
maybe? Nope.

42:47.700 --> 42:57.219
How long have you lived here? 17 years.
Why? What about your neighbors, you know

42:57.219 --> 43:05.670
them well?
No I keep to myself but I watch..

43:05.670 --> 43:14.469
So if someone new came around you know what
are you getting at Cop? I'm just trying

43:14.469 --> 43:18.099
to determine if you know maybe even you
saw something you didn't realize was

43:18.099 --> 43:21.690
important.
Look you're treating me like a suspect

43:21.690 --> 43:28.950
am i a suspect not to my knowledge. Have
a good day.

43:28.950 --> 43:35.229
Hey wait a minute. You was asking me
something and he was getting going on

43:35.229 --> 43:40.769
something what is it. Well Ruth I don't
think you're telling me everything. I

43:40.769 --> 43:46.959
mean there's a tire track in the mud in
your front yard. The report says you told

43:46.959 --> 43:51.459
officers you got home at midnight last
night but you didn't call the police

43:51.459 --> 43:56.769
until 12:41 and when the police showed
up you were still wearing your work

43:56.769 --> 44:02.489
clothes. Well what of it. Well that means
you probably hadn't showered yet

44:02.489 --> 44:07.979
certainly weren't in bed sleeping. I
don't follow.

44:07.979 --> 44:13.599
Well that means that you know the body
was dropped after you got home and you

44:13.599 --> 44:19.359
saw the whole thing or it was here when
you got home and for some reason you

44:19.359 --> 44:25.959
didn't call the police for 40 minutes.
Now which is it? There was nobody in my

44:25.959 --> 44:34.709
yard when I got home. Then you must have
seen you drop the body. I didn't see shit.

44:34.709 --> 44:38.039
Now leave me alone.

44:40.010 --> 44:49.460
Oh man you got it right where you want
her. Smooth. Hey maybe you should give her

44:49.460 --> 44:58.040
a ticket for littering huh huh ? You done?
Got a few more ?

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
So what do we got?

45:00.040 --> 45:02.040
Well...

45:02.760 --> 45:08.630
The wound on her neck similar the past couple of victim's . The body
was drained of blood.

45:08.630 --> 45:14.150
and we took a skin sample around the
wound tested it for animal saliva ,dusted

45:14.150 --> 45:17.240
the body for fingerprints, everything
came back negative.

45:17.240 --> 45:23.420
She had some cuts on her body you made
by a sharp object probably a knife. Where

45:23.420 --> 45:29.000
does that leave us. Well she died of major
blood loss but we don't know who or what

45:29.000 --> 45:34.460
made the injury. Whatever ripped her
throat out it was sharp and quick and

45:34.460 --> 45:40.580
even the lower body he was bitten and
mauled and check this out. She wore a

45:40.580 --> 45:48.890
ring but it's gone see the tan line. Okay,
okay so she's robbed. Well the report

45:48.890 --> 45:52.810
says she had almost 200 bucks in her wallet.

45:55.930 --> 46:02.060
You know what? We need to go talk to
Darlene you know maybe the victim worked

46:02.060 --> 46:05.350
for her and we can ask her a few
questions.

46:05.350 --> 46:09.829
Darlene?
Why it's so funny. You're on a first-name

46:09.840 --> 46:13.920
basis with the madam of the town brothel.
Hey hey...

46:20.720 --> 46:26.240
I'm here to speak with Darlene. Oh you want
to know the special rate for cops?

46:26.240 --> 46:32.560
Special what? No no I want to speak to
Darlene.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.280
Heather you can leave us.

46:44.289 --> 46:50.420
What do you want officer? Detective Brett
O'Shea with the Des Moines police

46:50.420 --> 46:56.599
department. There was a body found east
of here yesterday morning. We think the

46:56.599 --> 46:59.019
woman may have spent some time here at
some point.

46:59.019 --> 47:08.109
Her name was Ramona Smith. Never heard of
her. I didn't catch your name.

47:08.109 --> 47:15.460
Darlene... Darlene, I think I'm gonna take a
look around Darlene. What do you want?

47:15.460 --> 47:21.890
detective? Well simply put I'd like some
information about a girl that was

47:21.890 --> 47:26.029
murdered.
Okay I know Ramona. She worked here a

47:26.029 --> 47:31.869
while back. She decided she could do
better on her own. Happens all the time.

47:31.869 --> 47:36.859
She find a pimp? She get a boyfriend? I
have no idea.

47:36.859 --> 47:41.749
She was a smart girl. She may have
changed her mind. Did you get regular

47:41.749 --> 47:47.599
customers? How would I know? Well what about one of
your regulars? Maybe someone got too

47:47.599 --> 47:54.019
rough with her? Maybe someone wanted to
hurt her? All Things Considered I run a

47:54.019 --> 48:00.229
decent place here. Nobody gets hurt. You
men get attention. Women make a living. If

48:00.229 --> 48:05.809
you leave your card I'll give you a call
if I think of something. Darlene I

48:05.809 --> 48:10.430
don't think you understand. I've told you what I
know. I'll shut this place down . Give me a

48:10.430 --> 48:19.489
name. I haven't one to give. See this
business relies on discretion so as a

48:19.489 --> 48:25.309
homicide detective. I'm using mine right
now to decide if your ass is going to

48:25.309 --> 48:31.309
jail or not tonight. I'd offer you some
but I know you're on duty. I think I'll

48:31.309 --> 48:36.939
take one anyway. What are you gonna do,
call the cops?

48:37.029 --> 48:45.229
How rude.
All right um... There was this guy a while

48:45.229 --> 48:52.549
back, he came, and saw Ramona once in a
while. All the other girls hated him. He

48:52.549 --> 48:59.029
smelled weird. Cologne just weird.
What'd he look like. Honestly I never saw

48:59.029 --> 49:03.259
him he would always pull up front and
Ramona would leave with him and then

49:03.259 --> 49:08.479
after a couple of hours a car would drop
her off and she'd come in and show off

49:08.479 --> 49:14.869
new jewelry. This one time he gave her
this huge ass ring. Gold with a big red

49:14.869 --> 49:20.179
stone on it. This guy comes back you get
a hold of me day or night he understand?

49:20.179 --> 49:24.969
Oh he's not coming back here. Ramona was
the only one of them go near him.

49:24.969 --> 49:28.200
Randall!
I thought I told you not to come here anymore.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.960
Dammit Randall...

49:33.280 --> 49:35.840
What was that
all about?

49:35.859 --> 49:39.890
Okay I was just talking okay that's all
or just talking.

49:39.890 --> 49:44.900
yeah yeah it's inappropriate.
Makes us all look bad? Oh yeah yeah what

49:44.900 --> 49:49.940
was in that flask huh? Don't don't do
that I know what you're doing plus you

49:49.940 --> 49:51.589
don't know what I'm going through all
right?

49:51.589 --> 50:00.109
Oh what's that supposed to mean? Look man,
my wife's leaving okay. She's taking

50:00.109 --> 50:06.980
everything my house. Everything so... Sorry
It's all right I don't want to talk

50:06.980 --> 50:10.880
about it. I just want to go back to the
office. I was just trying to help, Look I don't

50:10.880 --> 50:16.190

back to the office okay? Okay just get

50:16.190 --> 50:18.790

50:24.320 --> 50:29.860
Hey Detective. Detective. Can I talk

50:29.860 --> 50:33.980

50:45.530 --> 50:50.000
Victor guy you were telling? I don't know

50:50.000 --> 50:54.830
before but I'm afraid, man. Well we need to
get you off the streets. I can't

50:54.830 --> 51:01.130

51:01.130 --> 51:07.190
ride somewhere. No no look... Just find miss
Darcy's killer... I don't be scared no more.

51:07.190 --> 51:17.990
How are things going with Lisa. You
know what Michael? What? I'm getting tired of

51:17.990 --> 51:21.380
this shit.
Tired of everyone around me being a

51:21.380 --> 51:25.460
selfish asshole.
I think that's just the way the world is

51:25.460 --> 51:32.740
these days. I don't care. You know Lisa
was a mistake. My boss thinks I'm crazy.

51:32.740 --> 51:38.750
You know my new partners a sociopathic
pervert and I got John Allen climbing up my

51:38.750 --> 51:45.560
ass every time a mouse farts near him.
And you know as I sit here in my house alone

51:45.560 --> 51:52.580
I realize I'm not alone at all. I'm
visiting with my great-grandfather's

51:52.580 --> 52:00.200
ghost. You need to get some rest Sonny
you're not gonna find the answers you're

52:00.200 --> 52:05.120
looking for at the bottom of that bottle.
Yeah well you know good detective will

52:05.120 --> 52:11.390
leave nothing to chance so I think I'll
finish it just in case.You need to stop

52:11.390 --> 52:15.740
drinking so much Sonny and if an Irish
meth like me is telling you then it must

52:15.740 --> 52:20.900
be true. I don't want your help Michael
I want to be left alone. That's not what

52:20.900 --> 52:26.060
you need. How would you know what I need
huh you weren't even real. You're in my

52:26.060 --> 52:32.660
head and I want to stop. You need to
listen to me. No you listen to me! I don't

52:32.660 --> 52:39.700
want you here okay? I want
peace, now get out of here let me think.

52:40.900 --> 52:46.760
If someone would have told me what I
just told you, I would have lived to be

52:46.760 --> 52:52.730
an old man. But I was stubborn. I didn't
believe and it got me killed in a

52:52.730 --> 52:59.640
basement full of pig shite and piss. I died
on the floor alone. Get out!

52:59.640 --> 53:01.640
-Eerie Music--

53:05.000 --> 53:13.520
-- A growling gutteral sound from outside...

53:13.520 --> 53:35.680
-Creepy music starts again--

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
--Cell Phone Ringing--

53:41.520 --> 53:49.500
Anders here. Now that's impossible.
Check the drawers. So you're telling me

53:49.500 --> 53:54.569
that John Allen's bodyguard with his
throat ripped out got up and walked out

53:54.569 --> 54:03.840
of the morgue?
Who's the clerk on duty? No blood at all?

54:05.440 --> 54:11.240
Well this is gonna be very difficult to
explain to the mayor.

54:11.250 --> 54:18.289
Thank you for coming detective. I I hope you don't mind
the smoke. Not at all.

54:18.289 --> 54:29.670
Try to relax okay? It was about one
o'clock this morning I heard a noise and

54:29.670 --> 54:36.400
so I looked out my bedroom window and I
saw something...

54:36.400 --> 54:44.420
What did you see? At first
it was this

54:44.420 --> 54:52.940
this shadow thing that just flowed from
behind the tree. One second it was a

54:52.940 --> 55:01.099
shadow and then the second it was it was
it was like a man. And the man had this

55:01.099 --> 55:08.720
long dark hair and then... It flowed? Yeah. He
just stood there right where the body

55:08.720 --> 55:21.319
was found and then and then he he looked
toward the house and I thought he saw me

55:21.319 --> 55:37.900
watching him. Oh God, I was so scared and then
when he when he turned toward the house

55:38.270 --> 55:41.920
I could see his face

55:43.330 --> 56:05.590
I will never forget his eyes I felt his
eyes on me... his red eyes. Red eyes? What do you mean?
didn't have on like red sunglasses I

56:05.590 --> 56:11.950
Red. Fiery red. I know what I saw and we'll never forget it.
It's okay.

56:11.950 --> 56:19.000
Okay try to calm down alright. You
uh you have a place to stay for a few

56:19.000 --> 56:21.880
nights?
oh I got someone who's coming to stay

56:21.880 --> 56:29.200
with me. I just wanted you to know what I
saw. Thank you I appreciate it.

56:29.200 --> 56:34.030
Now if he comes around again you get a
hold of me right away. The most important

56:34.030 --> 56:41.830
thing is to make sure you're safe though.
I got a bad feeling about this man. I got a bad

56:41.830 --> 56:50.040
bad feeling hmm. Ruth where'd you get
that ring?

56:50.430 --> 56:55.680
It's my grandmother's. Don't you bullshit
me. You took it off the dead girl didn't

56:55.680 --> 57:03.829
ya. What else did you take?
Nothing. Give me the ring. How could you?

57:05.510 --> 57:10.290
Little slut not like she needed it
anymore and it's not like you guys

57:10.290 --> 57:13.500
wouldn't have kept that if I hadn't got
to it first. I don't know where you get

57:13.500 --> 57:19.040
your facts but we don't do that. Now if he
comes around again you get a hold of me.

57:19.040 --> 57:22.550
Lock your doors!

57:53.170 --> 57:59.240
Randal with you? No. Good.
Wanted to stop by before I head to the

57:59.240 --> 58:06.350
station. My guard caught a guy watching
my house last night. He said he saw this

58:06.350 --> 58:11.210
guy hanging around he tapped him on the
shoulder the guy turned around and he

58:11.210 --> 58:17.780
just stared didn't move a muscle
nothing. Did you get a description? Longer

58:17.780 --> 58:24.380
dark hair. Oh and he's not from around here.
What do you mean like not from Des

58:24.380 --> 58:29.150
Moines. No no like not from America. Well
what was he doing here? Is he a customer?

58:29.150 --> 58:36.620
He was just watching the house, it was
creepy. Can I talk to him ? The guard was so

58:36.620 --> 58:42.890
afraid he quit. Jesus Christ what is
this iced tea? Yours. Hmm. That's funny

58:42.890 --> 58:52.040

take that savings and you can do
something. Go to school or something. I

little place. Well there you go now

01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:51.849
there's a plan. Have a good evening
Heather. Good night.

01:01:51.849 --> 01:01:56.280
Be careful out there, watch
your back.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:10.320
--Summer night sounds, bugs and stuff.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:17.800
The sound of something flying above...

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:25.280
Ominous drums

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.520
Flying above again...

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.680
Creepy Music...

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:42.880
Deep Growling sound.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.320
The growl is behind her....

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.760
Babbling brook...

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720
Who found her?

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.360
A truck driver. Hauling sheetrock. He found the body.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:18.640
Where's he at? He's down at the station
giving a statement. You speak with him?
Yeah you

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:27.800
know looks like a kid who watched his
puppy get hit by a car.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.080
Girl from the other night? Yeah.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:40.560
What's her name? She said her name was
Starlight but I think her real name was

01:03:40.569 --> 01:03:48.359
Heather. Heather? Yeah. What's her last
name? When did you last see her?

01:03:48.359 --> 01:03:55.539
What's with all the questions? Did you see her
last night when you're at Darlene's? What

01:03:55.539 --> 01:03:59.920
is this what you following me now. No you
idiot. I was staking the place out I saw

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.980
you. Okay hey I was off the clock okay? I
don't want to hear that. Someone in this

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.720
city is killing prostitutes. You're the
lead detective on the case and when

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.589
you're off the clock you're banging them?
Does that seem like a good idea Randal?

01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:18.339
Hey who do you think you are huh? Were
you with her? Hey hey hey hey back off I

01:04:18.339 --> 01:04:21.430
don't want to hear it okay? Were you?
What'd I just say?

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:25.289
You're drunk you don't know what you're
talking about so get out of here alright!

01:04:25.289 --> 01:04:33.369
Come on let's get to work!
Jesus.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:40.329
What the hell are you doing? It's middle of the night for me. Found one
of your girl's earlier this morning. She

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:49.849
was murdered. Who who was it? Heather.
What happened to her.Well how was she

01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:53.509
killed?
I don't know anything yet? I just saw her

01:04:53.509 --> 01:05:02.049
a couple of hours ago. Do you know when
Randall last saw her? Last night why are you asking?

01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:07.489
You know if he was alone with her?
Outside of here? I know she was alive

01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:10.869
when he left I don't know what happened
when she went home.

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:15.649
Think he would have came back here and
hurt her? He threatened her any of your

01:05:15.649 --> 01:05:18.559
other girls?
You think Randall could have killed

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:24.229
Heather? Oh god damn son of a bitch I'll cut his nuts
off. That's not what I'm saying. I'm only

01:05:24.229 --> 01:05:34.369
asking questions. Well let me know when
we can have her body. We take care of

01:05:34.369 --> 01:05:43.800
her burial. We bury our own here.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Two weeks , no pay, thanks asshole!

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.179
Hey there's three things you need to
know. One, I didn't tell anyone that you

01:05:56.179 --> 01:06:01.699
pushed me, there were witnesses. - I owe
you one buddy and you're gonna get it

01:06:01.699 --> 01:06:09.199
and three, I know you and Heather were
together last night. Hey hey she was fine

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:14.199
when I left okay. I never hurt her. Yeah
you know Darlene confirmed that however

01:06:14.199 --> 01:06:18.009
we did stop by late last night after you
left Darlene's.

01:06:18.009 --> 01:06:24.469
We rang the doorbell but no one answered.
why I was here I must have been in the

01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:29.989
shower or something. I didn't see any
lights on when I came by. Hey I was here

01:06:29.989 --> 01:06:35.569
okay I was hear. I even called you. Do
you think I'm lying?

01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:40.069
Is that it? No no what I'm saying is we
can't confirm that you were home at the

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:43.399
time of the murder.
Hey you know that doesn't mean I killed

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.819
her man come on. It doesn't but you know
the drill you're gonna have to come

01:06:46.819 --> 01:06:51.679
downtown and make an official statement.
Why that is bullshit. Why? Because you are with her

01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:56.479
and at this point your whereabouts can't
be verified that's why Randall. You think

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:01.540
I kill her. Just say it.
I don't know . I don't know this is great.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.260
This is just great.
First my ex-wife and now this bullshit.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.740
Calm down you know what if you're not
involved then things will get back to

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:19.990
normal. I can't trust you man I can't
trust you I can't. Why? Cuz you're nuts.

01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:25.870
that's why. What the hell are you
talking about? You are losing your

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.410
shit, you're talking to yourself you're
completely burned out now you want to

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:36.520
bring me down with you man.
Just can't. Why do you think that? Who was the

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:42.420
other detective that was with you last
night? I was alone? No why did you say we?

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.200
WE came to my house WE rang the doorbell.
Is this the same imaginary friend you

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.230
were talking to in the hallway or
outside of John Allen's yep I saw the

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:55.900
tape everyone has seen a team man now
what's going on? You better get your shit

01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:03.570
and let's go before we have a serious
problem buddy. Yeah? Get it.

01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:17.759
She was drained like the other victims.
Yeah. What's your thoughts on Randall? Do

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:23.069
you think he killed that woman? I want to
say no chief but I can't he claims he

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:29.488
was home not so sure. Well he's gonna be
on leave for a while. If you need any

01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:36.509
help let me know. Hey chief
when I was at these crime scenes I

01:08:36.509 --> 01:08:43.649
couldn't help but notice each one of
them had one tree now the vegetation was

01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:48.299
all lush and green around it but there
was one tree at each one and it was dead

01:08:48.299 --> 01:09:03.210
and mangled You know if you asked me a
few days ago I would call you crazy but

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:07.710
after looking at these reports these
photos and everything that's gone on so

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:13.559
far , I don't think we can rule anything
out. I mean none of this is looking good

01:09:13.559 --> 01:09:20.509
Brett. And something came for us. Killed
one of our own and then stole a corpse.

01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:28.020
I'm just as confused as I was the first
day I mean who would do this. Well I'm

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:34.479
starting to think the real question is
what would do this?

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:44.399
Honey I I'm a mess I know that okay and
I need you okay? Can you please just come

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:48.640
over they suspended me today okay?
I get it can you please just come over

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:55.600
so we can talk? We can work this out. You
can't just leave, we can work this out.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:04.030
I'll do whatever you want. Which okay all
right I know just give me that chance...

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.720
please?

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.000
Hey...

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.680
What are you doing here, Lisa?

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:25.640
I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake. you don' t seem happy to see me.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640
Surprised. That's all.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.640
Look I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.920
Hey...

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.120
Why are you here?

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:43.000
I had to make sure you were okay. I heard about the murders
and I just really worried about you.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:50.890
You know when you left me like that I lost
all the feelings I had for you.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:58.000
Can't you understand it I had to try? What did you
discover huh was it easy to just forget

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:06.960
everything we had? No I want us back the
way that we were. It's too late for that

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:13.600
I'm moving on and you should too.
You made this decision now we both

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:22.989
have to live with it. I was wrong. Can't
you give us another chance? Come on

01:11:22.989 --> 01:11:32.500
Come on. I can't trust you anymore. You
know I loved you I really loved you and

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.610
you just pissed it away. I can't go
through that again when the next job

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:42.310
comes along. What does that even mean?
There is a box of your stuff by the front door

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:51.700
all right don't forget it on your way
out. Okay Brett. you win okay. It's all my

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:56.950
fault.
I'm gonna leave but before I do know

01:11:56.950 --> 01:12:07.350
this... You are a spoiled drunk mama's boy
and you know deep down in your heart

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:14.800
good for you. And together you and I are
the best that we're gonna be and do you

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:26.130
want to know why? Because we love each
other. The sooner you accept my apology

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:36.120
sooner we can start living the rest of
our lives together. What? Oh you didn't get the memo?

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:43.300
It turns out you're mine mister. We are
in this for the long haul.

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:58.360
okay guess what? I quit my job in st.
Louis. I love you I know you love me too

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.760
okay? Let's stop all this stuff. You have work to do. I have to find a place to stay.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:13.510
Am I getting through to you?
Yeah I got a room if you want, till you find

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.130
something better. No pressure. What's
wrong with your room, Cowboy?

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320
Little Lamb...

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.240
Hello?

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.720
You unearthed the tunnels. You would have been
better off the leaving things as they were.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.000
What have you done to me? Let me go.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:52.240
Little Lamb... Little Lamb.. Don't be afraid,
you're about to see beautiful things.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.680
How'd it go yesterday? Still on
suspension pending an investigation.

01:14:04.699 --> 01:14:12.300
Good luck! How's the Birdman case going ? I haven't heard of any killings. You will

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:20.610
soon. John Allen's body was found. Looks
just like the rest of the murders.

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:26.310
This is gonna put the heat on all of us. What are you doing here? Hey I have an alibi

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:32.120
okay? Good you're gonna need it.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:40.630
Well just so you know, I'm gonna do
something that you can't. What's that? I'm

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:45.239
gonna solve this case. You have fun!

01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:13.190
Good evening chief. What are you doing in
my office? What I'm about to tell you is

01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:16.610
quite unbelievable
but I'm afraid you're gonna have to try.

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:20.390
You can go ahead and point your weapon
at me while we're talking but I promise

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:26.060
you it will have no effect on me. And why
is that? Your little hamlet has been

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:30.950
invaded by vampires.
Sadly my great-grandson Brett O'Shea has

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:35.660
been taken by them intentions unknown.
They've taken him to their den and he

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:42.760
needs you. You look pretty good for a man
your age as old as you say you are. So you're looking for proof.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.230
What if I told you that's your aunt
raised you as her own because when you were a wee

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:53.750
lad, your mother gave you away, Sadly she
had an addiction problem did she knew

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:57.950
she couldn't care for you. You never met
a real father because she didn't know

01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:01.400
who he was.
My mother died in a car accident when I

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:07.340
was six weeks old. Your mother lives.
She's in Kentucky. She wishes she could

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.150
meet you but you already know about
because you wanted to find it yourself

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:15.500
and you have you just haven't worked up
the courage to make the call. So the

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:20.870
detective that I hired told you all of
this. No chief but if you're still not

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:28.040
believing me maybe a way when I tell you
where your father is...

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.000
Think Lisa Think...

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Lisa. I'm Cheif Anders. I'm here to help him. OK, we need reinforcements or something...

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.800
We're on our own
We need help. Lisa what would you say if

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:10.540
I called you and said there were
vampires on the loose you would lock me

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.660
up in a loony bin okay. Don't tell me
about vampires an officer has been

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.080
abducted we need to help him right now.
Okay so what 20 men show up prepared to

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.140
fight what men and then they're
slaughtered because they're not prepared

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:24.460
for what's inside that building.
Okay so what do we do than. u

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:28.920
I'm glad you asked...

01:18:37.909 --> 01:18:42.110
So good to finally meet you

01:18:43.960 --> 01:19:05.110
I feel I know so much about you. You don't know me at all. Put him in the basement. show him our best hospitality.

01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:07.690
Holy Crap. It looks like a Walmart Garden Center. What are we gonna do with these? Stab them in the chest!

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:13.090
There's holy water too. Okay but how do
we know that's even gonna work let's

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:16.510
Lets just say I talked to somebody somewhat
of an authority on all things dead.

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:22.630
Okay that's super creepy. We take
out the vampires ASAP take them out one

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:26.520
by one
I wish we could wait until morning but... Bretts not gonna last that long.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.210
So we go on our own.

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:32.210
OK... Alright.

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:47.990
Master. we've done as you've asked. the men are
ready. Very good you all have my orders.

01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:51.500
Do not fail me.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:12.050
Why so hateful? Are we not both of the
netherworld brother? I'm suppose we are

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:18.540
but the difference is one of us is a
crazy loon. And the other?

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:22.530
Oh the other I'm afraid is a blood sucking
leech who has no idea his moments in this

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.130
world are fleeting...

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.220
You should have just gone away and left
us alone.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:48.230
What's the death of you miscreants to
you? Where is your soul? You were human once.

01:20:48.230 --> 01:21:12.050
Is that the best you can do? Oh I have
just begun. Brett got a girlfriend. I know

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:20.090
you have the girlfriend Brett and I will
turn her and when I do you can ask her

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:29.110
about her soul. Why don't you just kill
me and get it over with. We do great plans for you.

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:35.020
I will make you a soldier. I'll never join
you.

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:43.949
Why not? You'd be quite surprised at the
numbers of us would have amongst you.

01:21:43.949 --> 01:21:54.239
I've turn hundreds. They live all across
your country. Seize onto us and I can

01:21:54.239 --> 01:22:00.719
make you a God. There's no safe place for
you on this earth now that I know you're

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:09.960
here. Who you think you are? Don't you
understand evil isn't winning.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:37.720
Tense Music

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.160
Hello Gorgeous. Yum Tasty.

Oh yeah duh. Don't be a smartass Randall.

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:56.560
Where is she?

01:27:05.849 --> 01:27:11.249
I've had enough of you. I've had enough of your friends and this town and the smell of

01:27:11.249 --> 01:27:14.149
your human.

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:42.670
Worried yet? Do not get ahead of yourself detective.
I've been a God among man for hundreds of years.

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:52.220
I'm unimpressed. We were made to rule
over you . You're delusional. You should enjoy

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:59.500
your last few moments here on earth.
I made a mistake not to kill you before...

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:06.140
maybe I let you watch as I turn your
girlfriend and to my creation. You won't

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:13.670
have the chance to create anything again.
You are my biggest regret and my last. I WILL KILL YOU!

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:27.500
What's wrong Victor huh , Who are you? I'm
Brett immortal guardian you made a huge

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.690
mistake going up to one of the O'Shea
boys! Goodbye Victor.

stopping by.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:37.270
Any time Brett. You just have a good time
all right. We will. always a pain in my

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:42.219
ass. See you chief don't do anything I
wouldn't do.

01:29:42.219 --> 01:29:45.000
I won't.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:58.140
How's the hand? It's gonna be fine.

01:30:00.769 --> 01:30:10.070
Are you dry? 11 days.
Good on you boy I can see it in your

01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:12.249
eyes.

01:30:12.309 --> 01:30:15.610
You okay?

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:23.710
I've been called back for a while. I
should not have done what I did with

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:31.190
Anders and Lisa no one's to know I'm
here but you and there would be a price

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:38.090
to pay for breaking that rule. Thank God
you did. That I put in mention that to it

01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:40.539
when I see him.

01:30:41.949 --> 01:30:50.749
So uh what are you thinking of going?
Europe maybe Middle East . I'm not really

01:30:50.749 --> 01:30:58.369
sure. Be careful. All these crazy monsters
materializing out of nowhere. I'd hate for

01:30:58.369 --> 01:31:02.300
you to encounter one when you're in a
holiday. Can't come save you Arse you

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:08.059
know. Think that could happen? Sonny you
have special abilities you haven't

01:31:08.059 --> 01:31:12.739
discovered yet. I'm a little concerned
about what could happen. Wish I knew what

01:31:12.739 --> 01:31:20.389
these uh superpowers were. I didn't say
superpowers. I said special abilities. I'm

01:31:20.389 --> 01:31:27.519
not worried about it. I should probably
go check on Lisa give her a hand.

01:31:27.519 --> 01:31:31.610
I have to check in today herself,
might as well get it over with.

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:39.050
Hey before you go, I want you to be the
first to know when I asked Lisa to move

01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:46.630
in with me. Really? Well that's good.

01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:53.599
I assume you'll be married to her soon
then. One step at a time grandpa, one step

01:31:53.599 --> 01:31:57.670
at a time. Take care of Sonny.

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:09.410
Oh my boy. More trouble is coming
whether you're ready or not.

01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:20.180
You best be preparing.
