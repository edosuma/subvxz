02:28.930 --> 02:31.090
Welcome home, my love.

02:38.730 --> 02:40.730
CHLOROFORM

03:10.530 --> 03:11.889
Okay.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.690
Who wants to give it try?

03:15.410 --> 03:16.810
Somebody?

03:18.250 --> 03:21.530
Anybody, please.
We just studied this yesterday.

03:26.690 --> 03:28.090
Somebody?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.730
Anybody?

03:32.650 --> 03:34.250
Tara?

03:36.410 --> 03:38.430
It's okay.  Come on.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.470
Where are you looking at, freak?

04:44.650 --> 04:46.090
Nothing.

06:52.850 --> 06:54.250
I'm hurt!

06:55.910 --> 06:58.810
Oh please, I need help.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.770
Wait... What are you doing?

07:31.670 --> 07:34.970
You're late... for your recital!

07:57.690 --> 08:00.730
This is Classical 99.3.

08:15.830 --> 08:19.090
- Hello.
- I'm sorry.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.090
I was waiting for you to wake up and...

08:22.290 --> 08:24.330
I went and fell asleep.

08:27.050 --> 08:29.492
So how are you feeling?
You feel better?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.830
It's alright.

08:32.330 --> 08:35.450
I'm Judith Furik.
I'm a nurse here at Saint Angelos.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.730
- Saint Angelos?
- Yes.  We're in a hospital, darling.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.890
Don't worry though.
You're fine.  You just have...

08:41.929 --> 08:44.030
some mild abrasions.

08:44.770 --> 08:46.535
What happened?

08:46.570 --> 08:49.160
Well, I was hoping you
would tell me that.  You...

08:49.690 --> 08:53.310
Well, the police... They found you
dumped by the side of the road.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.810
You were very drugged
when you got here though.

08:55.845 --> 08:58.427
You were mumbling about Greenwich?

08:58.462 --> 09:01.010
Greenwich, Connecticut.
That's where I live.

09:01.730 --> 09:04.490
- Isn't that where we are?
- No.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.770
This is Stowe... Vermont.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.250
Vermont?

09:09.330 --> 09:10.695
Are you hungry?

09:10.730 --> 09:14.490
- You know... I made you some cookies.
- No.  I really need to talk to my mother.

09:14.525 --> 09:15.889
Oh sure.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.290
There's the phone.

09:36.730 --> 09:38.930
- Mom it's me.
- Tara?

09:38.965 --> 09:40.375
<i>What time is it?</i>

09:40.410 --> 09:41.810
<i>I was getting worried...!</i>

09:42.090 --> 09:44.770
Mother, listen.
I'm in big trouble.

09:44.870 --> 09:47.930
<i>I must have fallen asleep
with these stupid pills.</i>

09:47.965 --> 09:50.330
Mom, I need to come get me.

09:50.650 --> 09:53.810
- Call a cab, baby...
- Mom!  I'm in Vermont!

09:53.845 --> 09:55.890
43 Roads Park, Stowe.

09:56.090 --> 10:00.090
43 Roads Park, Stowe!

10:01.450 --> 10:02.850
Mom?

10:03.230 --> 10:05.210
Let me get a pen.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.975
Can I call you back in like five...

10:07.010 --> 10:11.750
Mom!  I was fucking kidnapped in fucking
Vermont and I need some fucking help!

10:11.830 --> 10:13.530
Can you call me back?

10:13.565 --> 10:14.965
Mom!

10:18.310 --> 10:20.110
Is everything alright?

10:20.910 --> 10:23.970
- You poor dear. You must...
- Please don't touch me.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.170
Would you rather I just leave you alone?

10:27.370 --> 10:29.890
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

10:32.810 --> 10:33.969
I'm sorry.

10:33.970 --> 10:37.370
Why?  You're the only
one that seems to care.

10:38.890 --> 10:42.430
Look.  I know that this is probably the
last thing you want to do right now, but...

10:42.930 --> 10:45.570
I need to ask you some
medical questions, okay?

10:46.210 --> 10:48.010
Over here.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.290
Are you in good health?

10:54.250 --> 10:55.650
Yeah.

10:56.610 --> 10:59.050
Any chronic diseases?

10:59.730 --> 11:01.130
No.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.330
Transmittable diseases?

11:03.770 --> 11:05.690
You know, like stuff in the blood.

11:06.270 --> 11:07.770
God... No!

11:12.410 --> 11:14.390
Have you been baptized?

11:16.210 --> 11:19.450
- Why?
- It's just on the form here.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.690
No!

11:28.610 --> 11:31.690
Now... this is a little delicate... um...

11:33.290 --> 11:35.490
Have you had sexual intercourse?

11:36.490 --> 11:37.569
Excuse me?

11:37.570 --> 11:41.290
Well, I have to ask you because in case
we have to do a rape test though.

11:41.890 --> 11:45.210
No... No.  I've never been with anybody.

11:46.890 --> 11:49.010
Never a kiss?

11:56.290 --> 11:57.770
A shame.

11:58.870 --> 12:01.450
You're such a pretty girl, Tara.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.050
How did you know my name?

12:07.930 --> 12:11.390
Your backpack...  You wrote
your name inside your textbook.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.770
I don't write my name in my textbooks.

12:16.190 --> 12:18.050
Oh, it would be a long walk.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.190
We're very isolated out here.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.370
The next house is probably 5 miles.

12:28.890 --> 12:31.290
- Where... where are we?
- Calm down.

12:40.130 --> 12:44.850
Help!  Help!
Help...

12:46.010 --> 12:48.070
It's not what you think.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.110
Judith?

13:06.490 --> 13:10.255
I have asked you not to play with her.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.090
I got you information, didn't I?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.995
She fits the criteria.

13:14.030 --> 13:16.370
If I left it up to you,
we would know nothing.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.610
Just calm down...

13:28.010 --> 13:30.970
- What's happening?
- Why are you doing this?

14:15.330 --> 14:16.730
Hello...

14:26.570 --> 14:28.330
Anybody out there?

14:33.090 --> 14:34.530
I have a weapon!

15:31.010 --> 15:32.610
Oh my God!

15:43.450 --> 15:44.850
Help!

15:45.230 --> 15:48.410
Somebody help us!
We need help down here.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.490
I can't swim!

16:40.770 --> 16:42.170
No!

16:51.890 --> 16:53.290
No!

16:55.410 --> 16:57.170
Baby, swim!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.370
Swim!

17:09.770 --> 17:11.970
Grab the rope.
Grab the rope.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.569
Come on breathe...

17:31.170 --> 17:33.290
Are you okay?

17:36.050 --> 17:37.730
Who did this to you?

17:38.370 --> 17:41.450
Did that crazy lady and that guy
upstairs... Did they do this to you?

17:42.170 --> 17:44.030
You don't remember?

17:51.410 --> 17:52.810
They drugged you.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.930
You don't remember anything?

18:02.670 --> 18:04.129
Johnny!

18:04.130 --> 18:06.310
Johnny, I'm Tara.

18:09.010 --> 18:11.050
Is there a way out of here?

18:17.870 --> 18:19.370
Over here?

18:27.090 --> 18:28.477
Even if we can get up there,

18:28.478 --> 18:31.182
we're not going to get through
the door without some sort of...

18:33.570 --> 18:35.070
Tools!

18:40.450 --> 18:41.850
Wait, wait, wait...!

18:47.450 --> 18:50.390
"Get out before it wakes up!"

19:22.930 --> 19:24.330
What is it?

19:26.490 --> 19:27.890
Johnny?

19:28.450 --> 19:30.330
Johnny, are you okay?

19:35.690 --> 19:38.410
"Get out now before it's too late."

19:41.090 --> 19:42.790
"Don't let it find you."

19:44.890 --> 19:46.850
"Tell my parents I
I love them."

19:47.010 --> 19:48.810
"Get out now"

19:56.630 --> 20:00.350
"Beware the fair haired child"

20:14.150 --> 20:16.190
Anton, what are you doing?

20:17.410 --> 20:20.930
This is my rehearsal room...
boss.

20:21.730 --> 20:25.490
Well, you'll get that tomorrow.
But now, we have a lot of work to do.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.730
You're late for your recital.

20:29.050 --> 20:30.910
No, I don't have recitals, Anton.

20:30.945 --> 20:32.770
That's what I said when I...

20:33.530 --> 20:35.250
... picked up the girl.

20:35.370 --> 20:36.850
You're late...

20:38.290 --> 20:40.290
Why did I say that, Judith?

20:41.450 --> 20:44.430
Well, we've... all been
under a lot of stress!

20:45.370 --> 20:48.370
Oh, yes.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.370
Of course!

21:15.590 --> 21:17.775
Anton, for God sake, what are you doing?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.530
I'm just trying to see
what color the room is today.

21:20.565 --> 21:22.130
Burgundy, I think it was.

21:22.165 --> 21:24.170
Or was it mauve?

21:24.530 --> 21:25.930
The girl...

21:26.490 --> 21:28.950
- She's young!
- Oh, so were the others.

21:28.985 --> 21:30.369
But the others were boys.

21:30.370 --> 21:32.610
What's done is done.
Well, just deal with it.

21:32.645 --> 21:35.330
- It's my fault.
- Anton?

21:36.850 --> 21:39.970
- If I had known how to swim...
- You stop it!

21:40.650 --> 21:42.050
Anton?

21:43.410 --> 21:47.470
You're my husband and I love you, but
you cannot fall apart on me right now.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.610
We have one night!
One more night.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.290
And our nightmare's over.

22:01.850 --> 22:07.090
Burgundy!  Yes...
I think it was burgundy.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.170
What do you think is in there?

22:25.690 --> 22:28.150
Well, maybe we should
just leave it and...

22:28.185 --> 22:30.610
Leave it alone and hope it'll stay.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.330
Alright, alright.

22:39.330 --> 22:40.730
Okay.

22:43.350 --> 22:45.130
This is what we're going to do.

22:46.810 --> 22:48.495
I'm going to count to three.

22:48.530 --> 22:52.730
When we open the door, whatever's
in it, we're just gonna bash it!

22:53.610 --> 22:55.730
Why?  Do you have a better idea?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.210
Okay.

22:59.650 --> 23:01.050
Ready?

23:03.930 --> 23:05.330
1...

23:05.970 --> 23:07.370
2...

23:08.250 --> 23:09.650
3.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.530
Johnny?

23:54.010 --> 23:55.410
Johnny?

23:56.850 --> 23:58.810
What's going on here?

24:03.170 --> 24:04.570
Johnny?

24:41.170 --> 24:42.770
I'm out of here!

24:44.930 --> 24:48.650
I wanna go home!
I just wanna go home!

25:00.830 --> 25:02.430
Johnny?

25:04.450 --> 25:06.210
Oh my God!
You're freezing!

25:06.610 --> 25:08.650
I think you're going into shock.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.090
What the hell did they give you?

25:12.370 --> 25:14.867
Here, here.
I gotta warm you up.  Here.

25:17.490 --> 25:19.090
Hold on to me.

25:20.190 --> 25:21.690
Hold on.

25:29.290 --> 25:30.369
Anton?

25:30.370 --> 25:32.090
Have you started yet?

25:32.930 --> 25:34.370
Nietzsche.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.630
- What?
- Friedrich Nietzsche.

25:38.050 --> 25:39.650
German philosopher.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.450
A terrible man.

25:41.650 --> 25:43.490
Loved roses.

25:53.450 --> 25:57.690
I remember we planted these
when the baby was born.

25:58.530 --> 25:59.915
Nietzsche said:

25:59.950 --> 26:02.090
"Anything done out of love,

26:02.770 --> 26:04.850
is beyond Good and Evil"

26:06.850 --> 26:08.370
We're not evil then.

26:08.405 --> 26:09.805
Are we, Judith?

26:15.290 --> 26:17.210
I still love you, Judith.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.890
Let's get started.

27:38.210 --> 27:39.770
Happy Birthday!

27:40.290 --> 27:41.655
Make a wish.

27:41.690 --> 27:43.090
Can I try all my presents first?

27:43.125 --> 27:45.375
- No, I think it is...
- Come now...

27:45.410 --> 27:48.788
It's not every day we turn 15, is it?
Hmm...

27:48.823 --> 27:50.050
Okay.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.650
But be careful, the lake
is cold, the water's deep.

27:52.685 --> 27:54.190
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.530
Mum!

28:11.770 --> 28:13.170
No!

28:13.690 --> 28:15.090
Mum!

28:19.190 --> 28:20.850
Keep swimming!

28:21.330 --> 28:22.850
Honey, stop it!

28:26.250 --> 28:27.930
Keep swimming, honey!

28:31.090 --> 28:32.490
Baby!

29:12.470 --> 29:14.490
Oh no...

29:20.250 --> 29:22.475
In death as in life.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.055
Yea either the darkness of
death may overwhelm life.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.810
Yea it with cease of
breath and heartbeat,

29:28.845 --> 29:31.850
thy loved one may live again.

29:32.050 --> 29:35.330
Between the here and the hereafter
lies a land of hope.

29:35.610 --> 29:38.930
The fire should burn in you,
the dead shall live again.

29:39.050 --> 29:42.250
New blood... for old.

29:47.970 --> 29:49.770
You've come.

29:51.210 --> 29:53.010
Will you help us?

29:56.270 --> 29:58.170
What is the cost?

30:01.890 --> 30:03.370
Oh no!

30:03.570 --> 30:06.035
- That is monstrous!
- Shut up.

30:06.070 --> 30:09.930
Judith, think of what it is asking?

30:11.290 --> 30:13.070
Shut up...

30:18.330 --> 30:20.050
Yes.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.430
We accept.

30:34.930 --> 30:38.410
Dust... now were my child.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.250
Dust now is not!

31:17.550 --> 31:19.050
How do you feel?

31:21.150 --> 31:23.670
Sorry... I was fast asleep.

31:23.805 --> 31:26.690
I was just trying to keep you warm.

31:28.370 --> 31:33.270
"I don't mind."

31:35.450 --> 31:37.790
It's not like we're married...

31:46.270 --> 31:48.290
It's gotten worse.

31:48.730 --> 31:50.850
I don't know where it's coming from.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.650
Johnny?

31:57.650 --> 31:59.050
Johnny?

31:59.630 --> 32:02.570
Oh, you're gonna get better, Johnny.
I promise.

32:03.210 --> 32:06.730
You're gonna get your voice back and
we're gonna get out of here.  I promise.

32:07.130 --> 32:09.030
Here.  It's alright.
I've got you.

32:09.730 --> 32:11.170
What can I do for you?

32:11.205 --> 32:12.690
How can I help?

32:14.190 --> 32:18.210
- "Talk to me".
- About what?

32:24.310 --> 32:28.330
This? That's just some stupid comic **.

32:29.650 --> 32:32.330
Okay!
It's about a dream I had.

32:32.365 --> 32:33.775
About this princess,

32:33.810 --> 32:35.970
who gets exiled from
her friends and family,

32:36.005 --> 32:38.930
and... So she flees to the woods.

32:38.965 --> 32:40.850
And that's where she meets them.

32:40.885 --> 32:42.295
The people of Phanos.

32:42.330 --> 32:44.775
And... they are
these evil, evil creatures

32:44.810 --> 32:46.450
that everybody is afraid of.

32:46.485 --> 32:49.010
But they become friends and...

32:49.170 --> 32:51.770
and they protect her...
And they do anything for her.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.070
And she would do anything for them.

32:56.690 --> 33:00.370
"It's coming."

33:00.405 --> 33:01.805
Johnny?

33:03.010 --> 33:04.450
Johnny?

33:06.370 --> 33:08.570
Oh no!  Johnny!

33:13.930 --> 33:15.650
Johnny!

33:21.770 --> 33:25.410
Damn you, you fuck!
You killed him!

33:25.930 --> 33:27.890
Let me out of here!

38:01.730 --> 38:03.650
Do what you have to my son.

38:04.050 --> 38:07.210
Do it and come back to me.

39:08.090 --> 39:09.910
What are you?

39:24.210 --> 39:25.810
It's empty.

39:31.210 --> 39:32.528
Jonathan Bernard Ruric
September 2, 1980

39:32.541 --> 39:33.870
- September 2, 1995 Our
Beloved Fair-Haired Child

39:33.905 --> 39:35.730
No, that's impossible!

39:55.650 --> 39:58.290
Where did you get a book like this?
This is crazy!

40:02.910 --> 40:05.570
"To those who brought music into my life,

40:05.890 --> 40:09.610
on the sad occasion of the
death of their beloved son

40:10.070 --> 40:11.890
"Jonathan"

40:15.690 --> 40:18.450
"In this book we turn the
music of life to them."

40:27.270 --> 40:29.130
This guy was a student?

40:30.050 --> 40:34.450
Your parents made a deal to bring him back
from the death and the price was what?

40:34.850 --> 40:36.250
Me?

40:36.310 --> 40:38.170
Well, the price was what?

40:43.450 --> 40:45.090
12 kids!

40:46.410 --> 40:47.890
Twelve...

40:48.770 --> 40:50.290
How often?

40:50.325 --> 40:51.810
Once a month?

40:56.570 --> 40:57.970
Every year.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.810
Every year on your birthday.

41:03.050 --> 41:04.450
Last...

41:04.870 --> 41:06.350
So I'm the last one!

41:08.170 --> 41:11.830
And then what?  You'll be fully
alive again and what?  I'll be dead!

41:12.130 --> 41:13.890
No!

41:14.750 --> 41:16.250
No!

41:19.250 --> 41:22.130
Johnny, stop it!
That is not your fault.

41:23.730 --> 41:26.190
No, I'm not going to let you do that.

41:27.810 --> 41:30.170
That's why they drugged you, isn't it?

41:31.170 --> 41:33.110
So you won't remember.

41:34.290 --> 41:36.770
So you wouldn't try and kill yourself.

41:37.370 --> 41:40.050
But you do remember sometimes, do you?

41:42.770 --> 41:44.690
That's when I found you.

41:55.690 --> 41:57.210
Sweetheart?

41:58.410 --> 42:00.810
She's the last one.  After this...

42:00.845 --> 42:02.089
No!

42:02.090 --> 42:04.370
You don't understand, Johnny.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.530
I'm your mother and
I love you very much.

42:08.410 --> 42:11.615
Haven't I always protected you.
Haven't I always been there for you.

42:11.650 --> 42:14.550
- You made him a monster!
- I did that for him.

42:14.585 --> 42:16.049
You did it for you!

42:16.050 --> 42:19.750
Those kids, they were alive?
They had parents who loved them!

42:19.785 --> 42:21.610
Don't you think I know that?

42:22.090 --> 42:23.695
Just shut up, Anton!

42:23.730 --> 42:26.770
All this doesn't finish.  Don't you see?
The item on translation...

42:26.805 --> 42:29.010
It said... Oh please.
We got to get her out of there!

42:29.045 --> 42:31.250
No!  Anton...

42:31.890 --> 42:34.530
If you let her out
it will kill our son again.

42:36.650 --> 42:38.230
Dad!

42:40.770 --> 42:42.170
No...

42:47.010 --> 42:48.490
Johnny, you can get through this.

42:49.930 --> 42:51.495
No, you're good.

42:51.530 --> 42:53.050
You're not a monster.

42:53.090 --> 42:54.690
You can.

42:56.370 --> 42:58.010
There's got to be another way.

43:03.970 --> 43:06.170
Even if I did
they would take somebody else.

43:07.770 --> 43:10.250
I don't want their blood on my hands.

43:23.890 --> 43:27.310
"I don't want yours."

43:38.490 --> 43:42.250
"Forgive me."

45:33.010 --> 45:35.730
"I forgive you Johnny"

46:11.410 --> 46:12.850
Go ahead.

46:27.650 --> 46:29.250
Welcome home, my love.

46:57.330 --> 46:58.770
What do you think?

46:58.805 --> 47:00.610
I wrote it for you.

47:01.090 --> 47:03.250
It's Brahms!

47:06.770 --> 47:08.830
Johnny, say something.

47:16.650 --> 47:18.450
Johnny, what are you doing?

47:19.850 --> 47:22.730
- Waiting!
- For what?

47:27.650 --> 47:31.350
You know, it's funny.  I was
always sort of jealous of you guys.

47:33.610 --> 47:36.270
Your music.
How talented you are.

47:36.370 --> 47:38.095
He's still in shock.

47:38.130 --> 47:41.450
I always thought I must
have a talent for something.

47:42.570 --> 47:44.215
It's strange...

47:44.250 --> 47:45.730
I think I found it.

47:46.050 --> 47:48.850
It turns out I'm really
good at bargaining.

48:04.410 --> 48:06.930
Johnny, what did you do?

48:10.130 --> 48:11.850
I made a deal, Mom!

48:15.370 --> 48:18.130
You had to give it what?
12 kids?

48:18.930 --> 48:20.770
I bargained it down to two.

48:21.650 --> 48:23.570
You want to know the best part?

48:24.170 --> 48:25.570
Johnny!

48:25.730 --> 48:27.690
They didn't have to be children.

49:19.090 --> 49:21.450
Meet me in the recital room.

50:20.330 --> 50:22.330
I was wondering when you'll be up.

50:25.810 --> 50:27.410
Do I know you?

50:28.250 --> 50:30.930
This is our home
where I'll take care of you.

50:34.050 --> 50:38.090
It's just some medication.
It makes your memory a little fuzzy.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.130
What happened to me?

50:41.810 --> 50:43.810
You've been through a lot.

50:43.970 --> 50:46.730
I'm afraid you're going to start
remembering some things that...

50:46.765 --> 50:48.565
aren't so pretty but...

50:48.670 --> 50:50.330
I hope you'll get through it.

50:50.810 --> 50:52.530
We've both been there.

50:53.610 --> 50:55.890
Are we friends?

50:56.450 --> 50:58.090
I'm Johnny.

50:58.125 --> 50:59.730
I'm Tara.

51:01.010 --> 51:02.650
I think!

51:03.890 --> 51:05.890
Come on.
I'll show you the lake.
