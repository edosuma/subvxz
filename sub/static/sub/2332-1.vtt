00:49.281 --> 00:52.250
We are not professing
to tell you...

00:52.252 --> 00:55.086
the complete story
of these activities.

00:55.088 --> 00:58.656
We are professing to tell you
the complete story that we know.

00:58.658 --> 01:02.160
But these records that we've
uncovered don't tell the story.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.628
They tell pieces of it.

01:03.630 --> 01:09.700
They were looking for...
fundamental information

01:09.702 --> 01:14.572
on compounds that were... would
be capable of causing...

01:17.209 --> 01:19.477
changes in behavior,

01:19.479 --> 01:22.346
changes in mental attitude.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.881
<i>Did you ever consider</i>

01:23.883 --> 01:26.217
<i>what would have happened
if any of these substances</i>

01:26.219 --> 01:28.519
<i>were given to, say,
unwitting people?</i>

01:28.521 --> 01:31.155
<i>Testing it out on an
American citizen?</i>

01:32.791 --> 01:34.158
I...

01:38.831 --> 01:44.202
I guess I must seem very,
very cold-blooded about this,

01:44.204 --> 01:48.039
but I don't recall ever having been

01:48.041 --> 01:50.141
very much preoccupied

01:50.143 --> 01:52.376
with that, uh... with that issue.

01:52.378 --> 01:55.313
Thousands of
government-sponsored experiments

01:55.315 --> 01:58.282
did take place at hospitals,
universities,

01:58.284 --> 02:00.585
and military bases
around our nation.

02:00.587 --> 02:04.222
Some were unethical,
not only by today's standards,

02:04.224 --> 02:06.491
but by the standards of the time

02:06.493 --> 02:08.326
in which they were conducted.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.761
Between the injection and the effects,

02:10.763 --> 02:14.599
the patient was
transported to whatever

02:14.601 --> 02:16.801
or wherever it is
that DMT leads people.

02:16.803 --> 02:21.305
When the Freedom of Information Act
released a bunch of documents,

02:21.307 --> 02:23.808
you found out that all
these different subjects

02:23.810 --> 02:25.576
that had taken this chemical

02:25.578 --> 02:29.647
all experienced the same
phenomena under the drug.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.716
They experienced something out there

02:31.718 --> 02:34.585
that came to them,
that met them halfway.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.354
But what you can't lose sight of

02:36.356 --> 02:37.622
is what all of this would mean

02:37.624 --> 02:39.891
in terms of individual human beings.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.392
There would be deaths,

02:41.394 --> 02:43.995
there would be long-lasting
and harmful effects.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.531
Everyone who took this chemical saw

02:46.533 --> 02:49.400
and witnessed the same thing,

02:49.402 --> 02:51.202
and they all named it
the same thing,

02:51.204 --> 02:53.404
even though they
were separate subjects.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.273
What'd they, uh...
What'd they name it?

02:55.275 --> 02:58.009
Well, that's actually the
name of the chapter.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.745
These entities were kind
of malignant and threatening.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.647
And, actually, a handful
of the volunteers

03:02.649 --> 03:06.184
had traumatic and terrible
encounters with these entities.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.419
Nobody should have
to go through this.

03:08.421 --> 03:12.423
The United States of America
offers a sincere apology

03:12.425 --> 03:14.192
to those of our citizens

03:14.194 --> 03:17.161
who were subjected
to these experiments,

03:17.163 --> 03:19.463
to their families,
and to their communities.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.633
It's something that
I think the general public

03:22.635 --> 03:24.669
has no idea that
our government was doing

03:24.671 --> 03:27.505
and could really open up some...
some eyes.

03:27.507 --> 03:31.442
And would you ever, uh... Would
you ever try the chemical?

03:31.444 --> 03:33.644
Uh, that's a big question, isn't it?

03:33.646 --> 03:35.580
That's the million dollar question.

03:42.854 --> 03:45.189
James Hirsch was a
close friend of mine.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.825
We graduated together
from Atticus University.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.894
We both took
writing courses together,

03:49.896 --> 03:53.297
and we'd often work
on stories late into the night.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.333
We wasted countless hours
at the bar

03:55.335 --> 03:58.135
arguing about
political philosophy and movies.

03:58.137 --> 04:03.107
But four years later,
my friend James went missing.

04:07.312 --> 04:08.713
All right, it's on.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.015
Now what do you want
me to do with it?

04:11.017 --> 04:13.017
Just, um...

04:13.019 --> 04:15.620
I don't trust myself to take accurate
notes while I'm on the chemical,

04:15.622 --> 04:19.357
so I'm gonna ingest it, and
you're going to record.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.825
Okay.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.893
Okay.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.868
Hello. My name is James,

04:30.870 --> 04:35.039
and this little guy
is 150 milligrams

04:35.041 --> 04:38.743
of specially enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine, DMT 19.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.747
It's supposedly impossible
to find, but here I have it.

04:42.749 --> 04:47.084
Well, where'd you get it?
Some friends in Colorado.

04:59.364 --> 05:01.799
Oh, uh, FYI, Renny,

05:01.801 --> 05:06.470
if this little chemistry
experiment goes sideways,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.373
I want you to finish my
book and dedicate it to me.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.210
Okay.
Be a terrible book.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.846
Might be a terrible book anyway.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.720
We're not actually doing
anything illegal here.

05:22.722 --> 05:26.457
Whoa, you look so weird, dude.
Shut up.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.458
No, just kidding.
You look the same.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.977
Do you feel anything?

05:32.503 --> 05:33.756
No?

05:39.438 --> 05:41.739
No, I don't feel anything yet.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.307
Hey, I don't want to see myself

05:43.309 --> 05:45.376
doing some weird drug on
YouTube.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.244
Well, if you do anything
remotely funny,

05:47.246 --> 05:48.546
I might actually save it.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.681
Don't fuck with me, Renny.

05:54.052 --> 05:55.486
So if nothing happens,

05:55.488 --> 05:58.522
are you gonna just make
something up for your book?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.863
Wait. Do you...

06:05.865 --> 06:08.332
What is that?

06:08.334 --> 06:10.568
Do you hear that?

06:10.570 --> 06:12.903
That radio?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.976
Where's it coming from?

06:18.978 --> 06:21.145
It's like interference.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.281
What is that?

06:57.283 --> 06:58.482
Wait.

07:04.156 --> 07:07.958
What if it's coming from
something in the house?

07:28.647 --> 07:30.815
Do you think someone's here?

07:45.263 --> 07:47.465
I don't like this.
We should call someone.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.066
I ingested the chemical, remember?

07:49.068 --> 07:50.434
I took that. We don't...

07:51.571 --> 07:53.471
Oh, fuck, Renny.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.705
What?

07:54.707 --> 07:57.508
It's coming towards the house.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.111
What is?
I don't know.

08:08.753 --> 08:10.721
What is this?!

08:12.224 --> 08:14.058
What do you want me to do?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.861
This...

08:16.863 --> 08:18.262
Help!

08:48.493 --> 08:51.028
Look, you think maybe he
was having some kind of spasm,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.097
some kind of reaction
to the drug he took?

08:53.099 --> 08:54.698
Look, no. It wasn't...

08:54.700 --> 08:56.166
Can you recall making any movements

08:56.168 --> 08:58.135
to strike or push him
when he was convulsing?

08:58.137 --> 08:59.303
Is that how it happened?

08:59.305 --> 09:02.506
No, I...
No. I just ran.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.875
I don't know what happened...
And you didn't take the drug?

09:04.877 --> 09:06.477
No, I didn't.
Are you sure?

09:06.479 --> 09:08.178
I didn't take the chemical!

09:09.714 --> 09:12.349
James and I didn't see
each other much after college.

09:12.351 --> 09:13.751
True to both our words,

09:13.753 --> 09:16.086
he struggled as a young,
but talented novelist.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.856
I got into journalism
at an online news site.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.559
Occasionally, we'd drop
each other an email

09:21.561 --> 09:24.161
just to check in.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.797
No one could tell me exactly
what had happened to James

09:26.799 --> 09:28.966
because no one knew.

09:28.968 --> 09:31.235
Nevada law enforcement
officials suspected

09:31.237 --> 09:33.971
he'd been murdered
by his friend, Renny Seegan,

09:33.973 --> 09:36.073
after James ingested
an enhanced form

09:36.075 --> 09:40.911
of a rare contraband chemical
known as Dimethyltryptamine.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.413
I been real nice up to now,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.615
but I'm gonna...
I'm gonna fuck your world, kid.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.816
Have you seen the kind of boys

09:45.818 --> 09:47.351
we got down there
in the county lockup?

09:47.353 --> 09:48.852
I'm gonna put you in there
with those son of a bitches.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.788
I didn't do...
I didn't do anything.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.890
Fresh piece of fucking chicken!

09:52.892 --> 09:57.061
All I know is he said it was
from some friends in Colorado.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.162
God.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.530
Oh, yeah.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.131
I hear that every time... friends.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.033
What kind of friend
gives you poison?

10:03.035 --> 10:05.269
Without a body,
police weren't ready

10:05.271 --> 10:07.771
to charge Renny Seegan
with any crime.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.107
They would never get the chance.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.776
Renny vanished
almost 72 hours later.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.179
He was never seen again.

10:17.882 --> 10:19.850
I decided that James
and I would work

10:19.852 --> 10:21.986
on one last project together.

10:21.988 --> 10:25.756
We would find out the truth
about what happened to him.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.392
It would be our final collaboration.

12:38.423 --> 12:42.626
"James, I expect you'll find this batch
will help immensely with your research.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.062
"It wasn't easy to come by, but
then again, nothing worth doing is,

12:45.064 --> 12:49.166
"so I expect a full report when
you come out on the other side.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.803
Sincerely,
your friends in Colorado."

13:34.813 --> 13:36.513
James, what happened to you?

14:07.245 --> 14:08.946
Hello?

14:14.719 --> 14:16.086
Hello?

14:28.333 --> 14:29.399
Henry Cale?
Yes.

14:29.401 --> 14:33.203
We spoke on the phone.
Hi. I'm Anne Roland.

14:33.205 --> 14:37.040
So tell me everything you know
about shortwave radio broadcasts.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.276
Yeah. Well, I'm an operator
and enthusiast,

14:39.278 --> 14:41.645
and I've been working with
it all my life. Come here.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.122
I don't like this.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.523
We should call someone.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.125
I ingested the chemical, remember?

14:55.127 --> 14:56.627
I took that. We don't...

14:58.464 --> 15:00.898
- Oh, fuck, Renny.
- What?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.533
It's coming towards the house.

15:04.970 --> 15:08.005
Yeah, that sound on the radio

15:08.007 --> 15:12.042
sounds exactly like one
of the known numbers stations.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.477
Numbers stations?

15:15.079 --> 15:18.949
Numbers stations are shortwave radio
stations of unidentified origin.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.552
They generally broadcast
artificially generated voices

15:22.554 --> 15:26.290
reading streams of numbers,
words, letters,

15:26.292 --> 15:30.127
backwards music,
or cryptic electronic code.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.529
They're in a wide
variety of languages,

15:32.531 --> 15:36.767
and the voices are usually
female for some reason.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.270
Sometimes it sounds like a child.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.472
And how long have you been
hearing them for?

15:42.474 --> 15:44.174
Well, the shortwave community's

15:44.176 --> 15:45.943
been finding them for decades now.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.744
Listen.

15:49.581 --> 15:54.584
7, 5, 4, 6, 8.

16:00.391 --> 16:04.394
8, 7, 7, 6, 5.

16:24.682 --> 16:27.417
Who would broadcast that?

16:27.419 --> 16:30.153
Lot of theories...
secret government agencies,

16:30.155 --> 16:31.955
terrorists, drug runners.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.024
But it's never been shown for sure

16:34.026 --> 16:35.959
who or what is broadcasting them.

16:35.961 --> 16:39.363
So you've been keeping track
of these numbers stations

16:39.365 --> 16:40.931
and documenting them for years?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.532
That's right.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.701
And you've heard that
particular broadcast before?

16:44.703 --> 16:46.370
Yes, I have.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.408
The signal sounded like a
broadcast from this small area

16:51.410 --> 16:53.710
we call the Lonely Traveler Station.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.545
The Lonely Traveler?

16:55.547 --> 16:57.148
Yeah. Shortwave radio
guys named it that.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.882
I've heard recordings,

16:58.884 --> 17:02.452
but I've never gone out there
to listen to it myself.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.622
Well, James's cabin
is right about here,

17:05.624 --> 17:07.656
same area upstate.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.627
So what do I need to do if I
wanted to record this broadcast?

17:10.628 --> 17:12.128
Well, it's not easy.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.365
You'd need to be out on the far
edge of the Black Rock Desert

17:15.367 --> 17:17.233
between 3:00 to 5:00
in the morning,

17:17.236 --> 17:19.669
and maybe cross your fingers.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.204
That's it?

17:21.205 --> 17:22.939
Doesn't sound so bad.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.074
Yeah, that's it.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.542
I can give you one of our receivers.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.743
One more question.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.614
Did you... Did you used
to work for the NSA?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.617
Excuse me?
You know, the NSA.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.819
You worked for them
as a code breaker.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.788
Why do you say that?

17:37.790 --> 17:41.158
Well, according to the NSA
employment verification contact,

17:41.160 --> 17:46.063
Henry Cale worked there
from 1963 to 1979.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.632
I wouldn't care to discuss that.

18:11.656 --> 18:14.558
So, out here in the
middle of nowhere,

18:14.560 --> 18:18.128
75 miles from the nearest town,

18:18.130 --> 18:21.264
on the outskirts of the
Black Rock Desert...

18:23.702 --> 18:28.538
Listening, watching
for the Lonely Traveler.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.407
Happy times.

18:53.164 --> 18:55.332
<i>♪ Don't know where</i>

18:56.300 --> 18:58.401
James was more than a friend.

19:02.774 --> 19:06.443
Sometimes I find myself asking,
were you in love with him?

19:08.846 --> 19:12.149
I guess I never really thought
of it until he was gone.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.254
The signal is getting stronger.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.492
That's weird.

20:41.005 --> 20:43.006
Is anyone out here?

21:13.537 --> 21:15.839
Fuck, they're watching.

21:22.213 --> 21:24.547
You need to be more careful, Anne.

21:24.549 --> 21:26.049
You don't know who's out there.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.585
With that substance,
do you know who or what

21:28.587 --> 21:30.120
James might have
been involved with?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.721
Well, there was this strange
message sent from someone,

21:31.723 --> 21:34.257
I think sent from his supplier.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.625
They didn't sign it with a name,

21:35.627 --> 21:37.494
but they signed it
"your friends in Colorado,"

21:37.496 --> 21:38.728
which is exactly the same thing

21:38.730 --> 21:40.196
that Renny Seegan
said on the police tape.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.998
Oh, "friends in Colorado."

21:42.000 --> 21:43.767
Yeah, "friends in Colorado."

21:43.769 --> 21:45.201
Like the novel.
You know it?

21:45.203 --> 21:46.336
Should I?

21:46.338 --> 21:47.637
Mm-hmm.

21:59.116 --> 22:03.453
Before your time, but it was a very
popular book in the late '70s.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.188
Wait.
This is a Blackburn novel.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.590
Yes. That's the way he
used to sign his letters,

22:07.592 --> 22:10.293
<i>the title of his novel,
Friends in Colorado.</i>

22:10.295 --> 22:14.230
Thomas Blackburn.
I... I know his work.

22:14.232 --> 22:18.201
Thomas Blackburn...
an infamous, crazed novelist

22:18.203 --> 22:19.669
risen from homeless, bipolar,

22:19.671 --> 22:22.505
counter-culture activist
to literary icon.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.377
His books were written
in a haze of pills, booze,

22:27.379 --> 22:29.913
and, to some, schizophrenic genius.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.782
He was a beast from a
less civilized era.

22:33.885 --> 22:35.018
Thomas!

22:36.021 --> 22:37.320
Hey, Thomas!

22:37.322 --> 22:38.621
You're ruining my concentration!

22:38.623 --> 22:40.557
He'd been arrested many times.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.759
During an interview in 1974,

22:42.761 --> 22:45.295
he tied the reporter to a chair
and threw him into the pool.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.563
He isn't coming up!

22:47.799 --> 22:49.699
He'd been arrested again

22:49.701 --> 22:52.802
at the late Senator Raider's
reelection party in 1996.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.204
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm press.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.438
Press right here.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.607
Hey, listen, ladies and gentlemen?

22:57.609 --> 22:59.943
Uh, you're campaign contributors.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.578
I just want you to know
that the acid in your drink

23:01.580 --> 23:03.847
is gonna kick in in
about 18 minutes.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.912
Thomas Blackburn?

23:35.914 --> 23:37.447
Who's asking?

23:37.449 --> 23:39.482
Hi. I'm a journalist
from risingjournal.com.

23:39.484 --> 23:40.817
I just wanted to know
if I could ask you

23:40.819 --> 23:42.652
a few questions about James Hirsch.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.454
Have you read my latest book?

23:44.456 --> 23:45.822
Which one?

23:45.824 --> 23:48.124
The one called
"Go Fuck Yourself"?

23:57.301 --> 24:00.036
So Blackburn isn't talking
to journalists anymore.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.639
That's fantastic.

24:07.077 --> 24:10.146
So let's see what
this little guy has to offer.

24:50.321 --> 24:51.988
Patient 11?

25:02.132 --> 25:04.000
Time is 5:13 P.M.,

25:04.002 --> 25:09.272
administering 200 milligrams of pure
Dimethyltryptamine extracted from...

25:10.574 --> 25:12.675
Nobody said anything
about restraints.

25:40.572 --> 25:41.838
What is this?

25:43.241 --> 25:44.574
Hello, Dr. Kessel?

25:44.576 --> 25:47.744
Just relax, please.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.546
Everything will be fine.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.618
Whose voice is that?

25:57.087 --> 25:59.622
They can see me.

25:59.624 --> 26:02.659
They... They can see me.

26:10.968 --> 26:14.304
In the room now.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.006
I can hear them.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.575
I can hear them.

26:20.744 --> 26:22.779
It's all gone away.

26:24.815 --> 26:26.716
It's all gone away.

26:29.219 --> 26:31.054
You hear them?

26:33.824 --> 26:35.325
It's all gone away.

26:41.699 --> 26:43.366
N1.

26:44.868 --> 26:46.836
N2.

26:48.339 --> 26:51.007
H2.

26:52.142 --> 26:55.144
O7.

26:56.313 --> 26:59.282
C11.

27:13.664 --> 27:15.098
They're here.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.601
They're here.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.003
Aah!

27:23.008 --> 27:24.407
Patient 11, can you hear me?

27:30.415 --> 27:34.050
Patient 11, I need you
to respond to me!

28:03.647 --> 28:09.352
Extracting 325 milligrams of
Dimethyltryptamine from a primary source.

28:15.025 --> 28:16.325
Do you know what's on that tape?

28:16.327 --> 28:19.862
That's not regular Dimethyltryptamine
that the CIA injected people with.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.364
Then what was it?

28:21.366 --> 28:24.834
They were extracting a chemical from
a special source, the human brain.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.502
Medical corpses, the pineal gland.

28:26.504 --> 28:26.957
Come on.

28:26.983 --> 28:28.771
The chemicals foundnaturally
in the brain?

28:28.773 --> 28:32.275
Yes. They're extracting it from dead
bodies, injecting it into live ones.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.309
Lovely.

28:33.311 --> 28:34.877
Anything else good on that tape?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.646
I don't know.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.648
The last 35 minutes
have been erased.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.083
I sent it over to the
guys at video forensics

28:40.085 --> 28:42.919
to see if they can pull
anything out of it.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.054
We get it back next week.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.355
Oh.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.457
In the meantime,

28:47.459 --> 28:49.759
I still got to find a way
to get to Blackburn.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.327
You just know he's connected to it.

28:51.329 --> 28:52.795
He's a writer.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.831
He doesn't have the skills to
synthesize something like that.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.199
It's a CIA chemical, I know,

28:56.201 --> 28:58.668
but maybe Blackburn got
his hands on it somehow.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.036
I mean, think about it.

29:00.038 --> 29:04.040
Both men in western Nevada,
the letter signature.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.875
Blackburn found the chemical

29:05.877 --> 29:07.276
and gave it to James
for his research.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.311
It's possible.

29:08.313 --> 29:12.882
It's probable, and I know what
to do to get to Blackburn.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.184
Great.
What are you gonna do?

29:33.670 --> 29:36.005
Honey, I'm home.

29:38.108 --> 29:39.776
How.

29:41.812 --> 29:44.013
One bourbon, please.

29:44.015 --> 29:46.749
Hey, Thomas.
What's up?

29:46.751 --> 29:48.050
I got arrested this morning.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.585
Same as yesterday, huh?

29:49.587 --> 29:52.722
Yeah, same as yesterday.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.957
I was peeing in my own front yard

29:54.959 --> 29:57.894
in the same spot I been peeing
in for the past 15 years,

29:57.896 --> 29:59.362
and there just happened to be

29:59.364 --> 30:01.297
a sheriff's deputy's
car parked there.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.965
Fuckin' Nazi cop.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.634
Don't you think it's a man's right

30:04.636 --> 30:05.735
to pee in the fucking desert?

30:05.737 --> 30:08.638
Thomas?
Thomas Blackburn?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.573
Yes?

30:10.575 --> 30:12.441
I'm the writer who emailed you.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.577
Sarah? Sarah Weiss?

30:15.779 --> 30:17.480
Right!
Right?

30:17.482 --> 30:18.881
Right, yes.

30:18.883 --> 30:21.751
The "print is dead,
down on her luck" story.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.186
Wow.

30:23.188 --> 30:26.289
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.325
Well, it's nice to finally...
Sarah.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.828
Oh, no thanks.
I've got a drink.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.362
That's not for you.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.835
I feel sorry
for you kids, you know that?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.269
With your fucking computers
and shit.

30:40.271 --> 30:41.804
You know what?
You can tell a writer

30:41.806 --> 30:43.372
who actually puts a pen to paper,

30:43.374 --> 30:47.844
who actually scribbles
on a fucking napkin.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.545
You haven't written a new
novel in, like, eight years.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.047
I'm an old fucking man.

30:51.049 --> 30:52.381
I would love to read
something you've written.

30:52.383 --> 30:53.950
No, you wouldn't.
No, you wouldn't.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.017
You know what I like to write?

30:55.019 --> 30:56.619
You know what I like to write?

30:57.988 --> 31:00.156
Pornography.
Oh, is that right?

31:00.158 --> 31:01.691
I'm quite good at it, yes.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.793
"50 Shades of Shit."

31:03.795 --> 31:05.828
Your fans worship you.

31:05.830 --> 31:06.896
They don't worship me.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.264
They worship an image of myself,

31:08.266 --> 31:11.334
an image I've created,
carefully constructed.

31:11.336 --> 31:12.568
I'm a myth.

31:12.570 --> 31:15.338
Come on, being loved
by so many adoring fans

31:15.340 --> 31:17.607
isn't a good enough
motivation for you?

31:19.544 --> 31:22.311
Let me tell you something one
of my ex-wives once told me.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.314
She said,
"Everyone will love you, Thomas,

31:25.316 --> 31:27.149
except those of us
who know you best."

31:27.151 --> 31:30.553
But tell me, young writer, what
is it you are writing about?

31:30.555 --> 31:33.589
Um, actually,
you'd probably love it.

31:33.591 --> 31:35.992
It's a novel about the
narco war in Mexico

31:35.994 --> 31:39.829
and two young lovers who experiment
with different chemicals and...

31:39.831 --> 31:41.097
It sounds fuckin' trite.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.331
Well, it's a work in progress.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.833
Yeah, make 'em...
make 'em lesbians.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.002
Really?
Burmese throat-singing lesbians.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.304
I don't know much
about that subject.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.705
Maybe you could help me.

31:49.707 --> 31:51.941
Well, speaking of ingesting
experimental chemicals,

31:51.943 --> 31:54.110
what are you doing this weekend?

31:54.112 --> 31:56.646
Um, I didn't plan that far ahead.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.647
Well, tell you what.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.048
Why don't you join myself

31:59.050 --> 32:01.083
and some fellow
travelers at my place.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.551
We're planning an experiment.

32:02.553 --> 32:06.956
It'll be an experience
you will not forget.

32:20.404 --> 32:23.406
Oh, I didn't know you were into...

32:24.708 --> 32:26.208
What is it, art?

32:26.210 --> 32:28.411
Yes, that's art, young lady.

32:28.413 --> 32:31.314
It's not a toy.
Don't touch that.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.517
So who did your interior
decorating, Charles Manson?

32:34.519 --> 32:37.253
Oh, why, fuck you very much.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.622
You have a lot of weapons around.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.757
Didn't you shoot
your assistant last year?

32:41.759 --> 32:44.026
Yes, and I feel terrible about that.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.428
But in my defense, she was an idiot

32:45.430 --> 32:47.463
for walking into my line of fire.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.700
Now people go around saying
I wanted to kill the bitch.

32:52.336 --> 32:54.704
How do you not go to jail for that?

32:54.706 --> 32:57.506
You still have your permit?

32:57.508 --> 33:00.643
When you're innocent, you
can get away with anything.

33:07.584 --> 33:08.718
Sarah?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.419
Party's in the kitchen.

33:23.967 --> 33:26.135
Sarah? Callie.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.771
Callie? Sarah.
Callie is wicked smart.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.073
She's got a PhD
in organic chemistry,

33:31.075 --> 33:33.776
but she's sort of an alchemist.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.778
Yeah, she's a bit granola
and crystal for me.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.415
She reeks of patchouli oil,
but I love her anyway.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.083
So this is it?

33:41.085 --> 33:43.386
How do you ever get
the formula for this?

33:43.388 --> 33:46.222
It's my own little secret recipe.

33:46.224 --> 33:49.392
This is government stuff, isn't it?

33:50.961 --> 33:53.896
Aren't you worried about
the dangers of taking it?

33:53.898 --> 33:56.399
This isn't the CIA, Sarah.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.435
We're not strapping
people down in a dark room

33:59.437 --> 34:02.338
and scaring the fuck out of them

34:02.340 --> 34:07.076
just to see how far
we can stretch their sanity.

34:07.078 --> 34:12.882
This is about... freedom,
mind expansion.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.184
Power to the people.
Freedom, motherfuckers.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.686
Positive energy.
That's right.

34:17.688 --> 34:18.721
Positive energy, huh?

34:18.723 --> 34:19.989
Mm-hmm.
I can do that.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.757
Yeah? You positive?

34:21.759 --> 34:25.127
So don't start on me with that...
Yeah, I am positive.

34:25.129 --> 34:27.897
Fear shit, Sarah,
if you're really positive.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.032
Well, it's my first time.

34:30.034 --> 34:33.601
It's normal, right?
What's normal?

34:35.739 --> 34:39.141
Here we go, Sarah.
Ready for takeoff?

34:46.616 --> 34:50.018
A little for you, a little for me.

34:50.021 --> 34:53.355
A little for you, a little for me.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.757
A little more for you.

35:04.067 --> 35:05.601
Ahh!

35:05.603 --> 35:07.336
Foul fucking venom!

35:14.745 --> 35:17.446
Wow.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.348
How long before it kicks in?

35:19.350 --> 35:22.418
Oh, a few minutes.
30 at the very most.

35:22.420 --> 35:25.921
Not as fast as injecting it,
but not as junkie, either.

35:25.923 --> 35:29.325
Here we go... chaser.

35:36.833 --> 35:40.836
Ms. Weiss, I wanted
to ask you something.

35:40.838 --> 35:43.239
Sure. What is it?

35:44.641 --> 35:47.710
How do you feel about liars?

35:49.146 --> 35:51.714
Uh, What? Liars?

35:51.716 --> 35:55.584
Liars, swine, swindlers.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.586
I don't know.
What do you mean?

35:57.588 --> 36:00.890
Well, I, for one,
cannot stand the bastards

36:00.892 --> 36:02.391
who are bad at it.
That's it.

36:02.393 --> 36:05.127
They lack a certain panache.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.263
Well, who does?

36:07.265 --> 36:10.166
Now, I'm not opposed to a good...

36:10.168 --> 36:13.269
a good swindle every now and then,

36:13.271 --> 36:14.770
but a bad one, a bad liar,

36:14.772 --> 36:18.307
that's something that
I simply can't abide.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.944
Yeah, I... I agree with you.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.379
What is it?

36:23.381 --> 36:26.015
Your name's not Sarah Weiss, is it?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.683
Excuse me?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.453
Now I can understand your
reticence with taking the drug.

36:31.455 --> 36:35.057
I mean, why would a fine,
upstanding investigative journalist

36:35.059 --> 36:36.892
like Anne Roland want to sully

36:36.894 --> 36:39.862
an already fragile reputation
with bad business like that?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.298
No, it's not like that.
You have to...

36:42.300 --> 36:44.700
It's okay, it's okay.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.602
I've, uh...

36:46.604 --> 36:49.238
I've told a few lies
in my time, too.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.575
Yes. Recently, in fact.

36:54.511 --> 36:57.546
For instance, I told you that the
drug was in that blue liquid,

36:57.548 --> 37:01.217
which you so discreetly
threw in my wastepaper bin.

37:02.385 --> 37:03.819
It's not?

37:03.821 --> 37:06.322
No. No.

37:10.393 --> 37:12.995
It was in the whiskey
you just drank.

37:16.366 --> 37:19.168
You motherfucker!

37:19.170 --> 37:20.803
No sympathy for the devil.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.504
Keep that in mind.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.509
Buy the ticket, take the ride!

37:29.379 --> 37:32.081
And it's gonna be a good one.

37:33.484 --> 37:36.485
Olivia, call me back
as soon as you get this.

37:36.487 --> 37:38.454
Blackburn tricked me
into drinking that chemical.

37:38.456 --> 37:41.190
He knew exactly
who I was this whole time.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.625
Call me.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.793
This is Anne, by the way.

37:53.503 --> 37:56.705
I... I can't be alone
with Blackburn.

37:56.707 --> 37:59.375
I feel uncomfortable.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.378
I... I feel unsettled.

38:04.147 --> 38:05.948
Unsettled?
What, like physically?

38:08.084 --> 38:09.618
Something is coming.

38:12.355 --> 38:15.057
What do you mean,
something's coming?

38:15.059 --> 38:17.059
Are you okay?

38:17.061 --> 38:18.761
No, I'm not.

38:22.932 --> 38:24.567
What's going on?
Wh-what...

38:25.193 --> 38:28.470
Something's watching you?
I don't like this. It can see me.

38:28.772 --> 38:30.840
Who can see you?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.741
I don't know.

38:41.852 --> 38:43.385
Did you hear that?

39:29.934 --> 39:31.667
Callie?

39:35.004 --> 39:36.905
Callie?

39:36.907 --> 39:38.073
What's happened?

39:38.075 --> 39:39.274
Are you okay?

39:39.276 --> 39:42.444
It looked at me from the window.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.546
What did?

39:44.548 --> 39:45.848
Talk to me!

39:45.850 --> 39:48.417
I turned around, and
it was looking at me.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.852
I saw it.

40:14.377 --> 40:17.112
It's coming to the house now.

40:29.292 --> 40:30.959
What is?

40:32.595 --> 40:36.298
It's downstairs now
by the back door.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.866
What is?

40:40.336 --> 40:41.603
You know.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.878
<i>♪ Then he goes out to the shops ♪</i>

40:49.880 --> 40:53.649
<i>♪ That line up outside his house ♪</i>

40:53.651 --> 40:58.454
<i>♪ He'll always pause
at his reflection ♪</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:04.960
<i>♪ But there ain't nobody there ♪</i>

41:04.962 --> 41:11.300
<i>♪ No, there ain't nobody there ♪</i>

41:11.302 --> 41:20.175

41:34.124 --> 41:41.697
<i>♪ I'll give you all that

41:58.882 --> 42:01.550
Aah!

42:02.919 --> 42:04.186
Aah!

42:07.957 --> 42:09.658
What is going on?

42:09.660 --> 42:10.926
There's something in
your house, Thomas!

42:10.928 --> 42:12.394
There's something in your house!

42:12.396 --> 42:13.462
Why, you're just hallucinating!

42:13.464 --> 42:14.596
Calm down!

42:14.598 --> 42:15.797
No, no.
Callie saw it! I saw it!

42:15.799 --> 42:16.999
There's something in your house!

42:17.001 --> 42:18.534
What? What? What?
Saw what?

42:18.536 --> 42:20.536
It wants to wear us.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.038
It wants to wear us.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.873
It wants to wear us!

42:26.043 --> 42:27.976
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

42:32.115 --> 42:35.417
All right.
You fuckers stand over there.

42:35.419 --> 42:36.919
Go on.
Sit in the corner.

42:38.454 --> 42:40.756
Sanity, for fuck's sake.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.668
I hear something.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.303
What the fuck?

43:06.282 --> 43:08.083
Holy...

43:09.619 --> 43:11.053
shit!

43:11.055 --> 43:15.691
What the fuck was that?
It was a hallucination.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.093
No, but...
We took a drug.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.127
No. No, no, no.

43:19.129 --> 43:20.495
Oh, fine!

43:21.498 --> 43:23.332
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Stop it!

43:23.334 --> 43:24.333
What's happening?

43:24.335 --> 43:25.334
Shut up.

43:25.336 --> 43:26.768
Oh, fuck.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.148
Do you have any idea who I am?

43:40.150 --> 43:41.783
I'll blow your fucking...

43:43.687 --> 43:45.754
Where's my gun?

44:23.693 --> 44:27.029
Thomas? Wake up.

44:27.031 --> 44:29.064
Thomas?

44:29.066 --> 44:32.167
Wake up.
Wake the fuck up.

44:34.904 --> 44:37.172
Where... Where's Callie?

44:37.174 --> 44:38.774
Where did she go?

44:38.776 --> 44:40.208
Don't know.

44:40.210 --> 44:44.046
Where...
Where the fuck did she go?

44:44.048 --> 44:45.447
What happened?

44:45.449 --> 44:46.515
Was it the drug?

44:46.517 --> 44:47.749
Did... Did it really happen?

44:47.751 --> 44:49.818
Where is she?

44:49.820 --> 44:52.387
I don't know.
It seemed fucking real.

44:55.958 --> 44:59.594
How long were we out?

44:59.596 --> 45:01.797
I don't know.
A couple of hours?

45:01.799 --> 45:03.899
I think the drug has
worn off at this point.

45:03.901 --> 45:05.901
Oh, before I forget.

45:07.771 --> 45:09.171
Jesus!
What the fuck?

45:10.240 --> 45:12.374
How could you...
I'll fucking kill you!

45:12.376 --> 45:14.643
You are just shit, Thomas!
Back off!

45:17.914 --> 45:19.414
Let's get the fuck out of here.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.582
Fuck.

45:26.055 --> 45:28.757
Look, I need to know what
happened back there.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.892
You and me both, sister.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.994
That's what these
government boys do

45:32.996 --> 45:34.663
is they take something beautiful,

45:34.665 --> 45:37.165
something transcendent
and powerful,

45:37.167 --> 45:39.801
like pure Dimethyltryptamine,
and fuck it up!

45:39.803 --> 45:42.304
Turn it into something dark,
something ugly.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.539
What, you think
it's a mind control thing?

45:44.541 --> 45:47.509
Well, if it's real, what
happened to Callie's body?

45:47.511 --> 45:49.811
Did you see her body?
No. No, I didn't.

45:49.813 --> 45:52.647
Me, neither.
Makes you wonder.

45:52.649 --> 45:54.516
Yeah. It makes me wonder
what else it did.

46:07.630 --> 46:08.997
We're now going to administer

46:08.999 --> 46:11.099
200 milligrams of the new compound,

46:11.101 --> 46:13.435
Number 19 enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine,

46:13.437 --> 46:17.739
a combined substance containing
extract from the primary source.

46:17.741 --> 46:19.775
Just relax.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.943
There we are.

46:23.679 --> 46:25.814
Just relax, dear.

46:51.908 --> 46:55.644
All right, don't be afraid.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.245
Don't be afraid.

47:35.785 --> 47:36.885
Patient 14?

47:39.122 --> 47:41.556
Patient 14, can you hear me?

47:43.125 --> 47:45.126
Patient 14, can you hear me?

48:01.277 --> 48:06.181
What's happening?
She's gone.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.483
Where are all the lights?

48:12.688 --> 48:14.456
Let's check in there.

49:09.679 --> 49:11.713
What is happening to her?

49:11.715 --> 49:12.781
No! No! No!

49:12.783 --> 49:13.982
Aah! No!

49:13.984 --> 49:16.017
No! No!

49:17.721 --> 49:19.955
It came.
It came through.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.290
What'd you say?

49:22.292 --> 49:26.928

49:26.930 --> 49:29.197

49:43.380 --> 49:46.181
Did you know James Hirsch?

49:46.183 --> 49:48.783
Uh... aspiring writer kid

49:48.785 --> 49:50.819
who wrote me some letters
a couple years ago.

49:50.821 --> 49:54.255
Wanted to know about the
chemicals used in MK-ULTRA.

49:54.257 --> 49:55.924
So you sent him the new chemical?

49:55.926 --> 49:58.626
Callie made a batch.
Each batch is different.

49:58.628 --> 50:02.130
But, yeah. Uh, he asked
nicely, using his real name,

50:02.132 --> 50:04.165
so we acquired him some.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.701
Well, James is missing,
probably dead.

50:06.703 --> 50:09.270
Did you know that?

50:09.272 --> 50:11.473
I did not.
I'm sorry to hear that.

50:11.475 --> 50:13.641
You don't even know
what he looks like, do you?

50:13.643 --> 50:14.743
No, I never met him.

50:22.818 --> 50:24.352
So that's it then, huh?

50:24.354 --> 50:25.987
That's what this
is all about.

50:25.989 --> 50:28.390
I want to know
what happened to James...

50:28.392 --> 50:29.858
why he went missing,
who's behind this,

50:29.860 --> 50:33.928
and what this MK-ULTRA drug
is really doing to people.

50:33.930 --> 50:35.497
You have any idea
what dirty business

50:35.499 --> 50:36.931
the U.S. Government has perpetrated

50:36.933 --> 50:38.633
on its citizens
over the last 200 years?

50:38.635 --> 50:41.636
And you want to know about one CIA
chemical brainwashing project.

50:41.638 --> 50:43.571
Well, you didn't know
James, did you?

50:43.573 --> 50:44.639
No.

50:44.641 --> 50:46.408
Considering you ingested
the chemical, too,

50:46.410 --> 50:48.076
I'm surprised
you're not more concerned.

50:48.078 --> 50:48.890
I mean, who knows?

50:48.916 --> 50:51.146
This shit could probably
kill you, too, Thomas.

50:51.148 --> 50:53.081
Oh, people are afraid of death

50:53.083 --> 50:54.983
just because death
is so fucking ordinary.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.985
It happens all the time.

50:56.987 --> 50:58.653
No, not like this.

50:58.655 --> 51:00.355
What about Callie?

51:00.357 --> 51:03.658
How did she get her hands
on this... this chemical formula?

51:03.660 --> 51:06.061
We didn't talk much.
She didn't talk much.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.429
You don't ask questions like that.

51:07.431 --> 51:08.797
It's bad etiquette, you know.

51:08.799 --> 51:10.165
It makes them squirrelly.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.266
Would you know where she lives?

51:11.268 --> 51:12.434
Maybe we can go there and check.

51:12.436 --> 51:13.968
Yeah, sure.
She lives in, uh,

51:13.970 --> 51:16.771
one of these McMansions
she bought outside of Reno.

51:16.773 --> 51:17.972
It was in an empty suburb.

51:17.974 --> 51:19.274
She got it when the market tanked.

51:19.276 --> 51:23.411
We used to go there
and smoke marijuana.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
Aah!

51:32.122 --> 51:33.455
Oh, my God!

51:46.236 --> 51:47.735
Are you okay?

51:49.272 --> 51:51.439
Thomas!
Are you okay?

51:51.441 --> 51:54.175
Talk to me!
Oh, fuck.

51:55.479 --> 51:57.912
Oh, my head!
God damn it!

51:57.914 --> 51:59.280
Shit.

51:59.282 --> 52:00.348
Shit.

52:00.350 --> 52:01.916
<i>♪ Someone</i>

52:01.918 --> 52:04.953

52:06.189 --> 52:09.624

52:15.064 --> 52:16.364
What happened to you?

52:16.366 --> 52:19.501
I don't know.
I blacked out.

52:19.503 --> 52:23.138
I heard chattering
and then blackness.

52:29.812 --> 52:31.112
Ow, shit!

52:31.114 --> 52:32.380
Thomas?

52:32.382 --> 52:34.215
Ohh!

52:34.217 --> 52:35.583
Are you okay?

52:37.286 --> 52:41.422
The chemical is like a catalyst.

52:41.424 --> 52:44.926
It...
It turns your mind into a receiver.

52:44.928 --> 52:46.694
It lets them in.

52:46.696 --> 52:48.296
How do you know that?

52:49.598 --> 52:52.834
I don't.
It's just a feeling.

52:57.139 --> 52:59.307
Well, I want to find out
who's behind this.

52:59.309 --> 53:02.844
Well, you're in luck, because I
think it wants to find us, too.

53:02.846 --> 53:03.945
You stay there.

53:03.947 --> 53:04.946
Take this with you.

53:04.948 --> 53:06.548
Keep it on channel two.

53:06.550 --> 53:07.882
Stay sharp.

53:09.385 --> 53:11.753
Radio check.

53:13.122 --> 53:14.422
Check.

53:14.424 --> 53:15.924
The button's on the side.

53:16.926 --> 53:18.126
Check.

53:18.128 --> 53:19.494
Check.

53:24.833 --> 53:28.036
Have you
ever read any H.P. Lovecraft?

53:28.038 --> 53:29.504
No.

53:29.506 --> 53:32.740
Wrote a story in about
1930-something or other

53:32.742 --> 53:36.010
was about a scientist who
created an electronic device,

53:36.012 --> 53:38.112
a giant tuning fork.

53:38.114 --> 53:41.349
It emitted
a resonance wave that, um...

53:41.351 --> 53:43.818
It stimulated anybody
who was nearby,

53:43.820 --> 53:47.589
their pineal gland,
allowing them to experience

53:47.591 --> 53:52.493
planes of existence outside the
scope of accepted reality.

53:52.495 --> 53:54.295
He would see incredible,

53:54.297 --> 53:57.899
sometimes horrible things,
these entities.

53:59.268 --> 54:01.769
He kept turning it up
higher and higher,

54:01.771 --> 54:05.173
'cause he was really getting
off on seeing this shit,

54:05.175 --> 54:08.109
but it was too late when he realized

54:08.111 --> 54:10.945
that the entities,

54:10.947 --> 54:13.348
they could see him, too.

54:13.350 --> 54:16.884
You know, that's a really fucked-up
story to be telling me now.

54:28.864 --> 54:30.331
Thomas, it...

54:30.333 --> 54:33.635
It looks like someone's been here.

54:46.181 --> 54:49.784
Are you sure she lived
here, like, ate and slept?

54:49.786 --> 54:51.486
She definitely was here.

54:51.488 --> 54:53.921
How much sleeping she did,
I couldn't tell you.

54:55.791 --> 54:57.625
There's a surveillance camera.

54:59.162 --> 55:00.595
Thomas, can you hear me?

55:00.597 --> 55:01.996
I'm getting static.

55:05.301 --> 55:07.302
What am I looking for?

55:07.304 --> 55:10.204
Should be a basement door
around the kitchen someplace,

55:10.206 --> 55:13.408
because anything she's making
is going to be below ground.

55:13.410 --> 55:14.909
Keeps the feds and
local law enforcement

55:14.911 --> 55:17.945
from using thermal imaging
to discover anything.

55:36.231 --> 55:37.999
I got it.

56:33.055 --> 56:36.824
Callie keeps parts of the
human brain down here.

56:36.826 --> 56:38.960
What does that mean?

56:38.962 --> 56:42.997
It means she took at least part of
the chemical from the human brain.

56:42.999 --> 56:45.767
Well, whatever floats
your boat, right?

56:45.769 --> 56:48.836
Can we go?
It's cold out here.

56:56.945 --> 57:00.014
She found Chamber 5.

57:00.016 --> 57:02.316
It's in the Black Rock Desert.

57:02.318 --> 57:03.351
What?

57:03.353 --> 57:05.052
Callie.
She found Chamber 5.

57:05.054 --> 57:07.522
It's where they did the
original CIA experiments.

57:07.524 --> 57:10.057
Dr. Kessel, MK-ULTRA?

57:10.059 --> 57:11.726
Can we go already?

57:11.728 --> 57:15.062
It's 2:45 in the morning,
and my eyes are bleeding.

57:27.242 --> 57:29.010
The time is 5:13 P.M.,

57:29.012 --> 57:33.281
administering 200 milligrams
of pure Dimethyltryptamine

57:33.283 --> 57:35.950
extracted from the primary source.

57:40.522 --> 57:43.191
N1.

57:43.193 --> 57:45.626
N2.

57:47.262 --> 57:50.998
H2.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.901
O7.

57:53.903 --> 57:59.407
"N1-N2-H2...
- C11.

57:59.409 --> 58:02.143
O7-C11"?

58:05.047 --> 58:07.248
Nitrogen, hydrogen...

58:09.017 --> 58:11.719
oxygen, carbon.

58:13.555 --> 58:16.757
Oh, my God.

58:16.759 --> 58:21.929
Uh, the CIA didn't come up
with the formula.

58:21.931 --> 58:23.865
They did.

58:23.867 --> 58:26.834
Oh, my God.
You were right.

58:26.836 --> 58:29.604
The chemical doesn't
make you hallucinate.

58:29.606 --> 58:32.373
It turns your brain into a receiver

58:32.375 --> 58:34.141
so they could come through.

58:36.311 --> 58:37.712
Shit.

59:45.581 --> 59:49.617
Thomas, I'm looking at
the video surveillance footage.

01:00:03.465 --> 01:00:05.766
It looks like Callie.

01:00:07.469 --> 01:00:09.070
It looks like...

01:00:10.138 --> 01:00:13.107
Callie walked down to the basement.

01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:17.011
Thomas, are you there?

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.880
I can see it on the footage.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.782
It's by the stairs.

01:00:37.566 --> 01:00:40.234
Eight minutes ago.

01:01:06.395 --> 01:01:07.962
Callie?

01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:15.903
Callie?

01:01:21.243 --> 01:01:23.110
Callie, is that you?

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:29.817
Callie?

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:13.160
Aah! Aah!

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.729
Aah!

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.299
Aah!

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.234
Help me!

01:02:28.877 --> 01:02:31.412
Shit! Shit! Fuck!

01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:35.082
Ohh!
Aah!

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.918
Well, Jesus, Anne!
You scared me!

01:02:50.532 --> 01:02:52.399
There's only one option.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.068
What is that, dear Anne?

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.971
Into the desert, Chamber 5.

01:02:59.274 --> 01:03:00.875
No shit.

01:03:10.986 --> 01:03:12.586
This is the heart of it.

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.155
Everything circles around here.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.257
I've seen things
in every single place

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:17.892
before either of us
took the chemical.

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:21.796
James's cabin, Callie's
house, the desert.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:25.866
This is where we need to go if
we want to stop the signal.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:29.036
This chemical is creating
more receivers,

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:32.106
more hosts to wear,
more ways to spread.

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.141
We've been fucked with enough

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:37.011
by this horrible hydra
of a research project.

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.913
You don't scare too
easily, do you, Anne?

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.348
This shit terrifies
the fuck out of me.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.450
Well, I'm more scared of
what it will do to me

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.252
if I try to run

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:49.056
and they all catch up with us.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.958
What if it doesn't follow us?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.928
Do you want to bet
your life on that?

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.202
Anne, I never gave you the drug.

01:04:03.138 --> 01:04:04.972
What?

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.041
I was fucking with you.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:09.009
You lied to me to get your story,

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:12.880
so I returned the favor
and I lied to you.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:17.451
There wasn't anything in that
whiskey, no... no DMT 19.

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:19.253
You're lying.
No, I'm not lying.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.121
You can walk away clean, Anne.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.423
What will I do when it
catches up with me then?

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.490
Then what?

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:26.026
The point is, you don't
have to do this.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.628
No, you're wrong.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.231
James's friend, Renny,
didn't take the drug.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.632
It was only a matter of days.

01:04:34.302 --> 01:04:35.402
Anne...

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:40.441
take your chances.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.610
Isn't that what I'm doing?

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:08.836
Ow!

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.371
What?

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.639
Shocked me.

01:05:13.074 --> 01:05:14.475
Static electricity?

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.976
No, no, no, her brain,

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.078
it's still giving off an
electromagnet charge.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.780
No, no. It's a corpse.

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.216
I know it's a corpse, Doctor.
It still shocked me.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.167
You seeing this?

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:43.037
There's still activity in the brain?

01:05:44.372 --> 01:05:47.741
This is something stronger
than normal brain activity.

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:51.979
State of high alertness, beta
waves range max at 40 hertz.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.048
This is going up to 135.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.316
That's strong...

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:14.702
I think we can walk from here.

01:06:16.838 --> 01:06:18.639
You okay?

01:06:21.576 --> 01:06:24.378
Thomas, you're bleeding again.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.681
I'm fine.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.817
You know, we don't have to do this.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.318
I can take you to a hospital.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.188
Hey, you said yourself
it'll be waiting for us.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.557
Let's not disappoint.

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:43.497
Every now and then,
you run up into a night

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:47.201
that's a stone-ass bummer
from start to finish.

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:50.437
On nights like those, if you
know what's good for you,

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:54.675
you hunker down and you hide.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.048
This is not one of those nights.

01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:11.592
Tell you what.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.427
We take this gas can,

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:16.563
and we torch
whatever we find inside.

01:07:18.099 --> 01:07:20.267
Lead on, Anne.

01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:47.261
This must be where they're
broadcasting from.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.001
There she blows!

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.336
Hump like a snow hill.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.472
This is an old fallout shelter.

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.908
Well, you gotta give
those government boys credit

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.676
for efficient repurposing.

01:08:27.902 --> 01:08:30.104
After you.

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.826
Well, this is it.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.694
It's Chamber 5.

01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:21.388
They just left it like this.

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:38.337
Thomas, put the drugs down.

01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:52.719
You know what that's for, don't you?

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.819
No.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.423
Medical doctors used
to tie people down to that

01:09:56.425 --> 01:10:00.327
and fill them full of exotic drugs.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:02.429
Now, that's entertainment.

01:10:04.365 --> 01:10:05.966
How do you know that?

01:10:59.153 --> 01:11:00.420
What is that?

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.356
Fuck if I know.

01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:33.553
I can't see anything.

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:34.755
Aah! Oh!

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:35.756
Oh, my God!

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:39.359
What is it?

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.962
Thomas, there's something
alive in here!

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:49.771
This is the transmitter.

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:54.074
This is the source. We...
We need to burn this thing.

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.609
Where did we put the gas?

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.544
They wanted us to come here!

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:58.912
Thomas, where the fuck...

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.420
There's something...

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:07.954
There's something
coming down the hall!

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.623
Thomas, there's something
coming down the hall!

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:12.526
Close the fucking door!

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.129
They're coming for us.
They're coming for us.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.964
My God, they're coming for us.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.566
That's it. We're dead.

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:25.038
Ohh!

01:12:28.076 --> 01:12:29.609
Oh, fuck.

01:12:34.882 --> 01:12:36.683
Here, you fucks.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.985
No, no, no, no!
Sorry, Anne.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.987
Aah!

01:13:03.244 --> 01:13:04.745
Thomas!

01:13:05.847 --> 01:13:07.481
Damn you!

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:08.008
Please... come... back.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.978
Please... come... back.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.816
Please... come... back.

01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:34.201
Aah!

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:43.243
Please... come... back.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:46.680
Please... come... back.

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:51.551
Please... come... back.

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:55.489
Please... come... back.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:59.025
Please... come... back.

01:15:02.263 --> 01:15:05.131
Please... come... back.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.167
Come... back.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.402
Come... back.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.372
Aah!

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.474
No!

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.076
Aah!

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.114
No!

01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:19.973
No.

01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:25.145
No. No.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.249
James? No.

01:16:31.252 --> 01:16:33.753
No.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:50.590
Thank God!

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:53.193
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.061
Just so damn glad you're safe.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.796
You scared the shit out of me.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.899
How you feeling?

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.935
Um, I'm surviving.

01:19:08.943 --> 01:19:11.044
Do you think they'll
charge me with anything?

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:13.213
Rising Journal will
take care of any legal fees.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.482
I think they'll just
want to keep you

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:16.716
a little while for questions

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:18.785
while they try to sort things out.

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:21.254
There's gonna be years of questions.

01:19:24.892 --> 01:19:28.595
Video forensics company
sent back your U-matic tape.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:31.898
They were able to pull
additional footage from the end.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.267
Well, what else is on that tape?

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:38.004
Let's... Let's not
worry about that now.

01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:43.076
The things I saw, I can't...

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:47.814
I found James's remains,
Olivia, in Chamber 5.

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.784
I... I... It was like he was
watching me this whole time.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.685
It was wearing him.

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.287
Who?

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:56.623
It wasn't the drug that killed him.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.826
It is a chemical catalyst
that turns the brain

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:02.061
into some sort of receiver
and... and...

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.097
so they could come through.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:10.036
Okay. I'm not saying this, but
you know what they'll say.

01:20:11.338 --> 01:20:12.906
They know the truth.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.241
I... I really wish I didn't.

01:20:17.444 --> 01:20:19.546
Can I ask you something?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.514
Sure.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:26.085
You're 100% certain that Blackburn
didn't put anything in your drink?

01:20:27.154 --> 01:20:28.888
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.990
But how do you know for sure?

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.458
He wouldn't.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.927
He has no reason to.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.895
Well, I hope you're right.

01:20:37.898 --> 01:20:41.901
'Cause you just never know what's
really going on in someone's head.

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.138
Yeah, you're right.

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:50.877
You never found
Renny Seegan, did you?

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.247
No.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:56.850
And he never took the drug, right?

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:03.323
No. I...
You're gonna be okay.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.630
No.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.699
No, no, no.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.033
What is that sound?

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.136
No, no, no. No, no.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.304
Help!

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.740
No! No!

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:24.177
Somebody help!
Please help us!

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.712
No!

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.146
Aah!

01:21:28.115 --> 01:21:30.416
Aah!

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.018
Again.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.353
Aah!

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.421
It turns your mind into a receiver.

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:37.123
It lets them in.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:40.660
Approaching 475 volts.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.630
His neurological response
is already so disrupted,

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.899
he's not going to be able
to recall any of this.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.567
He's going to exhibit

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.103
some very unusual mental side
effects for the rest of his life.

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.405
Fine. Make certain.

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:56.376
And again.

01:21:58.512 --> 01:22:00.480
Aah!

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:03.349
You never know what's really
going on in someone's head.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.418
What kind of friend
gives you poison?

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.088
When you're done,
take him out of here.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.657
Just dump him?

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.259
He's injected with DMT 19.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.428
We have no idea
what effect on the brain...

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.564
Clean-up and rehabilitation
are not our purview.

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.366
We are done with him.

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.802
You want me to just
hand him off to a field team?

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:25.204
Yes.

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:29.375
He lived near the campus,
grad student volunteer.

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:32.745
You can get his address
from our personal file.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.447
What's the name?

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.115
Uh... Blackburn.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.051
Thomas Blackburn.

01:22:41.422 --> 01:22:42.989
Hit him again.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.662
Aah!

showed that 60% of those

who had been de-patterned
still have amnesia

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:03.603
for periods of anywhere
from 6 months to 10 years.

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:06.072
That's quite a memory
loss, isn't it?

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.840
That is a memory loss.
Indeed it is.

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:11.344

more than desirable.
