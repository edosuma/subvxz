Come on, let me see your moves.

[Jaeger] Oh, fuck, man.

02:01.731 --> 02:02.832
Jesus Christ.

02:03.699 --> 02:05.532
- [Oyster] Sorry.
- [man] Fucking idiot.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.768
[Tony] Hey, hey, hey.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.970
I thought I told you guys
to settle down?

02:08.972 --> 02:11.305
[Oyster] We'll settle down
when you cut your hair.

02:11.307 --> 02:12.773
That seems like
a fair deal to me.

02:12.775 --> 02:14.842
Don't make me call the cops,
smart ass, all right?

02:14.844 --> 02:17.277
Hey, when's the last time
you oiled these lanes, bud?

02:17.279 --> 02:18.280
Yeah, homie.

02:19.382 --> 02:20.247
They're gripping like crazy
so we can't shoot well.

02:20.249 --> 02:22.216
[Oyster] Tony, will you
dance with me?

02:22.218 --> 02:23.419
I think we got off
on a wrong foot

02:23.754 --> 02:25.285
- and I'd love to...
- Get the fuck off me.

02:25.287 --> 02:26.720
[man] Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:26.722 --> 02:27.988
[Tony] Get the fuck off of me.

02:27.990 --> 02:28.922
[man] Whoa.

02:28.924 --> 02:30.759
Look, if you rednecks
don't like the way

02:30.761 --> 02:33.227
I run this place,
you can get the fuck out.

02:33.229 --> 02:35.396
Finally, I'm a redneck.
Fuck, yeah.

02:35.398 --> 02:37.299
- Congrats.
- [laughing]

02:38.001 --> 02:39.533
I'm calling the cops. Fuck off.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.301
Hey. Hey. Come on.
Let's all calm down.

02:41.303 --> 02:42.305
We're all right.

02:42.906 --> 02:44.339
He is the cops, dude.

02:44.341 --> 02:45.640
[man] Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

02:45.642 --> 02:48.275
Tony, look.
Give me... Give me that shit.

02:48.277 --> 02:49.713
Sit down. Sit down.

02:49.913 --> 02:51.746
My bad. My bad.
It's only my first week.

02:51.748 --> 02:53.547
- Hey. Tony, is it?
- [Tony] Yeah.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.783
How you doing? Chris Callahan.

02:54.785 --> 02:55.684
- [Tony] Tony.
- Pleasure.

02:55.686 --> 02:57.452
[Tony] I'm sorry.
It's my first week.

02:57.454 --> 02:58.853
That's all right, man.
That's cool.

02:58.855 --> 02:59.921
We come here every week.

02:59.923 --> 03:01.423
We should get to know
each other.

03:01.425 --> 03:03.560
It's all good.
I got an idea.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.261
If my brother balls
three strikes in a row...

03:06.263 --> 03:07.462
[Jaeger] Yeah.

03:07.464 --> 03:08.899
[Callahan]
...you buy us a round of drinks.

03:09.533 --> 03:12.934
- If he can't, we'll leave.
- What?

03:12.936 --> 03:14.903
[man] Wow.
That's a really good deal, Tony.

03:14.905 --> 03:16.336
- [Callahan] Come on.
- You're on.

03:16.338 --> 03:17.739
- All right.
- [man] That settles it then.

03:17.741 --> 03:18.941
- You got this?
- I got this.

03:18.943 --> 03:20.812
Okay. Go.
Let's go. Come on.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.981
- [man] Number one.
- [man 2] We got this. Yeah.

03:27.884 --> 03:29.553
[cheering]

03:32.857 --> 03:34.924
One strike.
[makes robotic whirring sound]

03:34.926 --> 03:36.959
[man] He's really good.
We forgot to tell you.

03:36.961 --> 03:39.561
And number two for my
less handsome older brother.

03:39.563 --> 03:40.764
- [man] Oh!
- [laughing]

03:44.602 --> 03:47.069
[cheering]

03:47.071 --> 03:50.007
Tony, what happened, man?

03:50.540 --> 03:51.541
[Oyster] You know what?

03:52.642 --> 03:54.477
For my third one, I'm gonna
need to be blindfolded.

03:54.479 --> 03:56.645
- [man] No.
- [man 2] No fucking way.

03:56.647 --> 03:58.313
[Jaeger] I can do it.
I promise you.

03:58.315 --> 03:59.280
No. I'm serious.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.750
[Tony] He does that,
I'll get you two drinks.

04:00.752 --> 04:01.917
Two.
He's gonna get us two.

04:01.919 --> 04:02.985
You'll get us two rounds?

04:02.987 --> 04:04.419
- [Oyster] I promise you.
- Do it.

04:04.421 --> 04:06.989
[cheering]

04:06.991 --> 04:08.426
[man] I don't approve of this.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.661
[Snowball] Now, be the ball,
baby. Be the ball.

04:11.629 --> 04:13.095
You got two steps
then shoot.

04:13.097 --> 04:15.497
- Throw the fucking rock.
- [man] Aim right. Aim right.

04:15.499 --> 04:16.500
Be the ball.

04:18.103 --> 04:20.505
[laughing]

04:20.805 --> 04:22.638
[Jaeger] Why?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.507
I'm sorry, Tony.
I got two.

04:24.509 --> 04:25.777
Can we still stay?

04:26.544 --> 04:27.777
- Tony.
- [man] Come on, Tony.

04:27.779 --> 04:29.611
- [Jaeger] Let us stay.
- [man] Come on, Tony.

04:29.613 --> 04:31.047
Let us stay, huh?

04:31.049 --> 04:32.681
I'm not buying you
fucking drinks.

04:32.683 --> 04:34.483
[laughing]

04:34.485 --> 04:35.586
[applause]

04:58.043 --> 04:59.644

[Callahan panting]

05:19.398 --> 05:20.599
[can sprays]

05:21.934 --> 05:23.367
[Jaeger] What do you think?

05:26.805 --> 05:28.673
Be good.
See you guys Wednesday.

05:30.742 --> 05:32.876
All right. I need to get
the bucket on the deck.

05:32.878 --> 05:34.010
I gotta catch a crew boat.

05:34.012 --> 05:34.878
[sizzling]

05:34.880 --> 05:37.516
[Oyster] Jalapenos
and a fried clam.

05:39.117 --> 05:41.519
Dude, that's fucking disgusting.

05:41.788 --> 05:43.089
Or genius, bro.

05:44.423 --> 05:45.357
[chuckles]

05:46.859 --> 05:47.893
Dude...

05:50.028 --> 05:51.730
you run like my grandma.

05:52.030 --> 05:53.632
[laughs]

05:53.967 --> 05:54.968
Go.

05:59.438 --> 06:01.740
[laughing]

06:06.212 --> 06:07.612
[Callahan] Wanna go again?

06:07.614 --> 06:08.547
[car honks]

06:09.749 --> 06:10.884
[Jaeger] Finally.

06:14.953 --> 06:17.822
You're 20 minutes late, man.
We were waiting for you.

06:17.824 --> 06:19.724
[Milk] I'm putting
out fires, bro.

06:19.726 --> 06:20.693
What are you doing?

06:21.628 --> 06:22.793
[Jaeger] What am I doing?
I don't know.

06:22.795 --> 06:25.031
Uh, I'm not making excuses. Hmm.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.566
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.067
Not so close...
[screams]

06:30.069 --> 06:32.538
[laughing]

06:33.506 --> 06:34.972
[Callahan] Hey. Hi, Rachel.

06:34.974 --> 06:36.207
[Jaeger] Look who it is!

06:36.209 --> 06:37.875
[Callahan]
God. She's beautiful.

06:37.877 --> 06:39.509
Here comes the monster.

06:39.511 --> 06:40.710
[laughing]

06:40.712 --> 06:41.779
High five.

06:41.781 --> 06:43.416
- Oh, so strong.
- Yeah.

06:44.517 --> 06:46.550
- Snowball, what's up?
- What's up, my brother?

06:46.552 --> 06:47.818
- You good?
- [Rachel] You animals.

06:47.820 --> 06:48.653
[Callahan laughs]

06:48.655 --> 06:51.155
All right. I stink.
I'ma shower up.

06:51.157 --> 06:53.090
Five minutes.
Get your camis on.

06:53.092 --> 06:54.494
Five minutes, McKowski.

06:54.727 --> 06:56.827
- Hi.
- [giggles]

06:56.829 --> 06:57.931
Hi.

07:01.901 --> 07:04.103
[sniffs]

07:05.604 --> 07:07.672
- Fucking sick.
- Fuck.

07:07.674 --> 07:09.109
Are you wearing cologne?

07:10.110 --> 07:11.642
Fuck yourself.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.278
Can you smell it
all the way up there?

07:13.280 --> 07:14.812
Yeah. Fuck yeah.
I can smell it.

07:14.814 --> 07:15.880
I thought we were
fucking going by

07:15.882 --> 07:16.983
a candle shop or some shit.

07:18.118 --> 07:19.251
I'm right next to him.
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

07:19.253 --> 07:20.653
Fucking smells like glitter.

07:20.921 --> 07:21.922
[laughing]

07:22.922 --> 07:23.890
It's part of my fucking
morning ritual, okay?

07:24.991 --> 07:27.658
What is your morning ritual?
Walk us through that.

07:27.660 --> 07:28.626
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:28.628 --> 07:31.763
Well, I get up
in whose ever house I'm in,

07:31.765 --> 07:33.033
get home, usually.

07:33.566 --> 07:34.567
Crawl out a window.

07:35.668 --> 07:36.536
- [Snowball] Crawl out a window.
- Crawl out a window.

07:37.237 --> 07:38.105
Put on my crisp white strips.

07:38.938 --> 07:40.137
[laughing]

07:40.139 --> 07:41.740
- For about half an hour.
- Fuck you.

07:41.742 --> 07:43.809
You got to let
those things set in, you know.

07:43.811 --> 07:44.812
Then I do the hair.

07:45.946 --> 07:46.878
That's a good... That's a good
15 minutes in itself.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.980
[Milk] Yeah,
it's got a good coiff to it.

07:47.982 --> 07:48.880
And then, uh... Yeah.
Just as I'm going out the door

07:48.882 --> 07:51.582
maybe a little spray
and walk into it.

07:51.584 --> 07:52.883
Walk out of the door, you know.

07:52.885 --> 07:55.223
What, uh...
What's your cologne called?

07:57.691 --> 07:58.859
What's it called?

07:59.226 --> 08:00.325
It's called Transcendence.

08:00.327 --> 08:03.230
- No!
- [laughing]

08:03.696 --> 08:06.500
[indistinct chatter]

08:06.700 --> 08:08.769
[chanting]

08:15.175 --> 08:18.113
[indistinct chatter]

08:19.114 --> 08:20.048
[man] No, Cal.

08:21.015 --> 08:22.047
Please don't make us
do a squat thrust, man.

08:22.049 --> 08:23.982
[Callahan] Come on.
It's one weekend a month.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.152
You can do this.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.521
[Oyster] Fuck.
Has anybody seen my cover?

08:28.922 --> 08:30.025
Oh, come on.

08:30.759 --> 08:34.193
[groans]
Fuck. Fuck.

08:34.195 --> 08:35.629
No, I think I left it
back at the...

08:35.929 --> 08:36.897
God damn it.

08:37.664 --> 08:38.999
Where's your cover, marine?

08:40.634 --> 08:41.635
Fuck me.

08:42.636 --> 08:43.636
Hold on.

08:44.272 --> 08:46.975
Staff Sergeant Callahan,
a word.

08:47.608 --> 08:48.609
[sighs]

08:51.246 --> 08:53.047
Staff Sergeant, what's up
with your Devil Dog?

08:53.313 --> 08:55.083
- Sorry, sir.
- Aren't you two related?

08:56.785 --> 08:57.984
Half-brother.

08:57.986 --> 08:59.785
When are you gonna
get your shit together?

08:59.787 --> 09:02.257
No. When are you gonna stop
sleeping with men for money?

09:02.956 --> 09:05.258
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.026
[Oyster] Hey,
you don't have a cover now.

09:07.028 --> 09:09.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck is going on?

09:09.831 --> 09:11.032
He took my cover.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.600
[Oyster] Well, he started it.
Ask him.

09:13.935 --> 09:14.969
[Callahan] Come on.

09:15.303 --> 09:16.304
[Oyster] Sorry.

09:17.806 --> 09:19.273
[Callahan] Give me 20
on the obstacle course.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.276
- All right, Staff Sergeant.
- [Callahan] Come here.

09:21.843 --> 09:23.111
The fuck is wrong with you?

09:23.344 --> 09:25.278
Man, he's just always
on my shit.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.846
- He's jumping in my face.
- What the fuck?

09:26.848 --> 09:28.016
You can't drill without a cover.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.417
Yeah. I know. I had my
cover laid out for me...

09:30.419 --> 09:32.852
- Go field day the head.
- ...and I just spaced... What?

09:32.854 --> 09:34.823
No. Come on. Let me do
the obstacle course, Cal.

09:35.123 --> 09:36.689
- Staff Sergeant.
- Staff Sergeant,

09:36.691 --> 09:38.193
- let me do the obstacle course.
- Now.

09:42.697 --> 09:44.266
[man] All right, gents.
We're going white light.

09:46.235 --> 09:48.835
Real world.
We're in condition one.

09:48.837 --> 09:52.305
Hammered pairs, single brain.
Single brain.

09:52.307 --> 09:54.376
- Give me one.
- [all] Yeah!

09:55.144 --> 09:57.777
Brace, brace front!
Close door right!

09:57.779 --> 09:58.845
[man] Clear.

09:58.847 --> 10:00.214
[man 2] Moving!

10:00.216 --> 10:02.617
- [gunshots]
- Brace, brace front.

10:03.785 --> 10:05.019
Move! All clear!

10:05.220 --> 10:07.187
- [gunshots]
- [both] Clear!

10:07.189 --> 10:08.388
- [man] Room all clear.
- Callahan,

10:08.390 --> 10:10.924
dig your fucking corners!
The lazy way is the dead way.

10:10.926 --> 10:13.327
And Yoo-hoo, you're
finger fucking your safety.

10:13.329 --> 10:14.396
Get the gun in the fight.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.935
[indistinct chatter outside]

10:42.758 --> 10:45.426
[Callahan] Mama and Papa
were laying in bed.

10:45.428 --> 10:48.428
[all] Mama and Papa
were laying in bed.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.331
[Callahan] Papa rolled over
and this is what he said.

10:51.333 --> 10:54.202
[all] Papa rolled over
and this is what he said.

10:54.204 --> 10:56.204
- [Callahan] I want some.
- [all] I want some.

10:56.206 --> 10:57.771
- [Callahan] I need some.
- [all] I need some.

10:57.773 --> 10:59.106
- [Callahan] Get some.
- [all] Get some.

10:59.108 --> 11:00.441
- [Callahan] Get some.
- [all] Get some.

11:00.443 --> 11:01.509
- [Callahan] Grease some.
- [all] Grease some.

11:01.511 --> 11:03.379
[Callahan] <i>I've heard
some grumbling,</i>

11:03.812 --> 11:06.247
<i>not enough gear,
how they're calling up</i>

11:06.249 --> 11:07.850
a bunch of old reservists.

11:08.884 --> 11:11.852
I know, uh, some of you
got full-time jobs

11:11.854 --> 11:12.988
you don't wanna leave.

11:14.123 --> 11:16.725
I think we got, what?
Two, is it, that are expecting?

11:17.928 --> 11:19.928
But, uh, at some point,

11:19.930 --> 11:21.331
we all signed on
the dotted line.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.065
You took an oath
to serve your country

11:24.067 --> 11:25.235
in its time of need,

11:26.303 --> 11:27.470
and now's that time.

11:30.473 --> 11:31.539
We clear?

11:31.541 --> 11:32.807
[all] Yes.

11:32.809 --> 11:33.875
Back in the fight.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.212
[cheering]

11:46.957 --> 11:47.958
[Callahan] What?

11:48.992 --> 11:50.293
Just wish you'd look out
for me.

11:51.494 --> 11:52.761
[Callahan] Really?

11:54.232 --> 11:56.199
Didn't I just get you a job
at the diner?

11:57.267 --> 11:59.801
Just feels like whenever
it's between me or someone else,

11:59.803 --> 12:01.471
you side with the other guy.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.006
[Callahan] What do you
expect, man?

12:05.008 --> 12:06.442
You know, I petitioned
the Marine Corps

12:06.444 --> 12:07.942
to forgive your felonies.
What do you do?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.345
You get in a fight
the second we got out there.

12:09.347 --> 12:10.146
[Oyster] I'm starving.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.914
[Callahan] Yeah.
Well, there's lasagna.

12:12.916 --> 12:15.051
[Oyster] That lasagna
is still in here.

12:15.852 --> 12:18.554
[groans] I made this,
like, two weeks ago.

12:18.556 --> 12:19.856
It's disgusting.

12:27.197 --> 12:29.934
You know I got that job at the
diner 'cause I'm good, right?

12:31.168 --> 12:32.403
I'm good at cooking.

12:34.305 --> 12:36.070
And the Marines
need people right now.

12:36.072 --> 12:38.509
It's not like some felony waiver
is a big favor to me, man.

12:43.214 --> 12:45.916
You always got a smart-ass
response, don't you?

12:46.484 --> 12:48.352
Yeah.
Brains is my burden, homie.

12:50.621 --> 12:52.887
Yeah, well, you got
one more offense,

12:52.889 --> 12:54.459
you're going back in.
You know that, right?

12:54.859 --> 12:56.160
<i>Soy comprehende.</i>

12:57.128 --> 12:59.094
You know, you're really
starting to piss me off.

12:59.096 --> 13:01.096
[Oyster] Can I remind you
of what you were like at my age?

13:01.098 --> 13:02.631
Oh, I got my shit
together though, didn't I?

13:02.633 --> 13:04.333
At least I finished high school
in four years.

13:04.335 --> 13:05.336
I actually read books.

13:06.438 --> 13:07.305
You read, like, magazines
like <i>Guns & Ammo.</i>

13:09.407 --> 13:12.276
- Don't worry. I'm moving out.
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.311 --> 13:14.445
I'm serious.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.880
I got a business plan
for a fleet of food trucks.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.584
I'm gonna make a mil
by the time I'm 30.

13:20.184 --> 13:21.586
- Oh, yeah?
- [Oyster] Yeah.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.119
What do you know about
running a business?

13:24.121 --> 13:25.621
Lots.
There's this book called

13:25.623 --> 13:27.423
<i>The 7 Habits of Highly
Successful People,</i>

13:27.425 --> 13:30.395
and it teaches
all the secrets of success.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.397
- [Callahan] Oh, yeah?
- [Oyster] Yeah.

13:33.398 --> 13:34.566
What are they?

13:35.667 --> 13:38.067
I haven't read the book yet
but when I get into...

13:38.069 --> 13:40.602
[laughs]
You haven't read the book.

13:40.604 --> 13:43.039
I just got the book.
How am I supposed to read it...

13:43.041 --> 13:44.574
- I'm sorry.
- ...when I just bought it.

13:44.576 --> 13:46.309
- I'm sorry. That wasn't cool.
- No. It's not funny.

13:46.311 --> 13:47.943
- The fuck are you laughing at?
- Hey, come here.

13:47.945 --> 13:49.679
Don't...
I'm not gonna fucking tell you.

13:49.681 --> 13:51.514
- Don't do that, all right?
- Fuck off.

13:51.516 --> 13:53.082
I just wanna know about
the habits...

13:53.084 --> 13:54.252
[Oyster] Get the fuck off me!

13:59.524 --> 14:00.425
What?

14:00.958 --> 14:05.931
[grunting]

14:06.131 --> 14:07.199
Fuck.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.002
You're fucking deranged, man!

14:11.570 --> 14:12.968
Teddy.

14:12.970 --> 14:14.373
- [door slams]
- [sighs]

14:15.207 --> 14:18.076
Hey. You all right?

14:22.180 --> 14:23.315
[knocks on door]

14:24.049 --> 14:25.217
What happened?

14:25.450 --> 14:27.452
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Go away.

14:31.289 --> 14:33.358
- Let me take a look.
- [Oyster] <i>Go away.</i>

14:39.598 --> 14:41.199
[playing guitar]

14:47.305 --> 14:48.641
I think the chicken's done.

15:12.231 --> 15:14.232
[indistinct chatter]

15:17.503 --> 15:19.437
So, uh, what...
How do you guys...

15:19.439 --> 15:21.238
You guys know Jaeger?
You just, uh...

15:21.240 --> 15:23.107
- Oh, he just came up to us.
- Yeah.

15:23.109 --> 15:23.908
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:23.910 --> 15:26.111
- Yeah. He does that.
- [chuckling]

15:27.313 --> 15:29.078
- [woman] Thank you.
- Water, vodka, vodka.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.782
[woman] Thank you, sir.

15:30.784 --> 15:33.719
- So you really don't drink?
- Uh, I used to.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.321
He'll have a drink
with a side of communion wafers.

15:37.323 --> 15:39.290
- [laughing]
- What do you do for fun?

15:39.292 --> 15:41.493
I mean,
I'm having fun right now.

15:41.495 --> 15:42.596
[woman] Are you?

15:43.464 --> 15:45.697
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

15:45.699 --> 15:47.766
- [laughing]
- Oh!

15:47.768 --> 15:49.733
- There he is.
- What up, Snowball?

15:49.735 --> 15:51.938
- [Snowball] What's up, baby?
- And Milk.

15:52.171 --> 15:53.172
- Hi.
- Bro.

15:54.374 --> 15:55.642
- Can I get a beer, please?
- Yeah. Here's your beer. Bam.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.579
CO, sidebar.

15:59.278 --> 16:01.147
Clara's in the AO,
can I tag out?

16:04.083 --> 16:06.151
All right.
Will you cover me while I move?

16:06.153 --> 16:07.219
Yeah.

16:07.221 --> 16:09.321
Ladies, have you seen his tats?

16:09.323 --> 16:10.755
- Whoa.
- No. Let's see them.

16:10.757 --> 16:13.390
- Check them out.
- Wow. That is sexy.

16:13.392 --> 16:15.794
- Thanks.
- [woman] What does it mean?

16:15.796 --> 16:17.362
[Callahan]
I got them a while back.

16:17.364 --> 16:21.235
Yo, yo, yo.
Come. Come with me. With me.

16:22.134 --> 16:23.435
- It's your lucky day.
- Oh, really?

16:23.437 --> 16:24.703
Show me. Show me.

16:24.705 --> 16:26.671
[Jaeger] Ladies, look who
I just bumped into.

16:26.673 --> 16:28.405
Everybody, this is Snowball.

16:28.407 --> 16:30.408
- Hi, ladies.
- Uh, and this Oyster.

16:30.410 --> 16:31.543
These guys happen to be related.

16:31.545 --> 16:33.745
- No. Where are you going?
- [Jaeger] Uh, that's Val.

16:33.747 --> 16:34.846
Hello, ma'am. I'm Oyster.

16:34.848 --> 16:36.181
- [Jaeger] And this is Carrie.
- Hello.

16:36.183 --> 16:37.549
[Jaeger] Carrie is
an English major.

16:37.551 --> 16:38.717
I speak English.
That's great.

16:38.719 --> 16:39.684
[Carrie]
You're coming back, right?

16:39.686 --> 16:40.587
Nice meeting you.

16:41.656 --> 16:42.256
- [woman] Amazing.
- Yeah, I've been doing it wrong.

16:43.257 --> 16:45.559
- Seven to 11.
- Oh, hi.

16:46.493 --> 16:49.261
- Oh, hi. Good to see you.
- You too.

16:49.263 --> 16:50.862
- How are you?
- Great. Great.

16:50.864 --> 16:52.864
- Hey, Clara.
- Hi, Cal. How are you?

16:52.866 --> 16:54.232
You gonna buy a round of those

16:54.234 --> 16:56.236
for your two favorite
servicemen?

16:56.838 --> 16:58.537
- Maybe next round.
- [Jaeger] Mm.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.274
[Callahan]
What you, uh, doing in town?

17:00.474 --> 17:03.377
- My mother's 60th.
- Oh, nice.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.748
When are you guys shipping out?

17:08.147 --> 17:09.316
Uh, any day.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.420
Wow. I can't believe they're
actually sending in reservists.

17:13.787 --> 17:15.819
Yeah, you know,
if you were going off to war,

17:15.821 --> 17:18.858
I would definitely...
I would do the patriotic thing.

17:18.859 --> 17:22.461
You know, I'd buy you a drink.
I'd invite you back to my place.

17:22.463 --> 17:23.731
Can my boyfriend come?

17:26.233 --> 17:28.266
I mean, I guess
he could hold the camera.

17:28.268 --> 17:29.404
[chuckles]

17:30.672 --> 17:32.705
Only you would use this bullshit
war as an excuse to get laid.

17:32.707 --> 17:34.141
- Only you.
- [chuckles]

17:35.309 --> 17:37.743
- Usually works. [chuckles]
- [Clara] Not tonight.

17:37.745 --> 17:39.714
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- No.

17:40.414 --> 17:41.416
You sure?

17:42.483 --> 17:44.686
I don't how we ever broke up.
You're so charming.

17:45.286 --> 17:47.753
Ah, well, there was a time
when it wasn't beneath you

17:47.755 --> 17:50.123
to date a guy
who didn't have a masters.

17:54.162 --> 17:56.431
Time to go.
Have fun tonight.

18:03.771 --> 18:04.806
It went well.

18:06.842 --> 18:08.708
Just got a text
from the ball and chain.

18:08.710 --> 18:09.777
[Snowball] What's he say?

18:10.913 --> 18:13.212
"Look, don't get so drunk
you can't fuck me later."

18:13.214 --> 18:15.381
- Oh.
- [laughs]

18:15.383 --> 18:17.251
You know, um,
in World War II

18:17.720 --> 18:19.686
they invented wife swapping,
because, you know,

18:19.688 --> 18:21.220
the life spans were so short.

18:21.222 --> 18:22.655
So I'm here for you, bro.

18:22.657 --> 18:24.357
Rachel would never fuck
a Mexican.

18:24.359 --> 18:26.759
That's literally not what
every mariachi in town says.

18:26.761 --> 18:28.894
- [laughing]
- [imitates mariachi band]

18:28.896 --> 18:30.866
[laughing]

18:31.900 --> 18:34.901
Yo, can I get ten bucks,
because I really wanna buy

18:34.903 --> 18:37.536
these lovely ladies
a few alcoholic beverages,

18:37.538 --> 18:39.572
and I have had a few more
than they have had.

18:39.574 --> 18:40.873
[Milk] Go panhandle
somewhere else.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.776
All right. I'm out of here.
I'm spent.

18:42.778 --> 18:45.211
You, easy on the booze,
and don't make a fucking

18:45.213 --> 18:46.913
- racket later, okay?
- Oh, will you get a wife?

18:46.915 --> 18:48.481
Then you can boss
your wife around,

18:48.483 --> 18:49.750
so you don't have to
boss me around.

18:49.752 --> 18:52.518
You get your own another place,
do whatever the fuck you want.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.288
All right, Staff Sergeant.
All right, Staff Sergeant.

18:55.290 --> 18:56.923
- [Jaeger] All right. All right.
- Staff Sergeant.

18:56.925 --> 18:58.527
- [Jaeger] Mailbox.
- We're racing.

18:58.727 --> 19:00.527
- No, I'm gonna stick around.
- Are we running?

19:00.529 --> 19:02.363
- [Milk] Oh, yeah.
- Stay gold, pony boy.

19:03.666 --> 19:06.901
Last time we only went to Milk's
and I gave up.

19:06.903 --> 19:09.503
- What up, Dwyer?
- What's up, dude?

19:09.505 --> 19:12.606
DJ, hey, can I get $10
because I got these

19:12.608 --> 19:14.340
beautiful honeys back there,

19:14.342 --> 19:15.709
and I wanna buy them
some drinks.

19:15.711 --> 19:17.745
- I'm a little low on cash.
- Oh, yeah, man.

19:17.747 --> 19:18.946
- Yeah.
- That's a good friend.

19:18.948 --> 19:20.480
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:20.482 --> 19:21.882
But you better hurry up
before Daley

19:21.884 --> 19:23.318
gets all of that shit, huh?

19:25.287 --> 19:27.756
Always Ben fucking Daley.

19:27.956 --> 19:29.391
I'm gonna kill this kid.

19:30.526 --> 19:31.493
[Callahan] Really?

19:32.561 --> 19:32.929
[Jaeger] I'm not letting you
win this time, Milk.

19:34.030 --> 19:35.397
- Shit.
- Hey.

19:36.032 --> 19:39.566
Thanks, Captain Planet.
[laughs]

19:39.568 --> 19:40.502
All right.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.804
I got to fucking beat you, man.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.239
Get ready to be smoked.

19:45.441 --> 19:46.976
- Mark.
- Set.

19:47.743 --> 19:48.677
Go.

19:50.479 --> 19:53.381
- You're going down, Milky.
- [laughing]

19:53.383 --> 19:54.317
[screams]

19:57.687 --> 19:58.722
[girl chuckles]

19:59.656 --> 20:01.354
Where are the prettiest girls
at the bar

20:01.356 --> 20:02.892
doing with a couple of scoobs?

20:03.759 --> 20:04.927
What... What's a scoob?

20:06.296 --> 20:07.964
Just please leave.
Bye-bye.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.733
Fuck off, Oyster.

20:10.033 --> 20:11.233
Sorry.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.300
- Yikes.
- What's a scoob?

20:13.302 --> 20:16.336
I don't know.
Just kind of came to me.

20:16.338 --> 20:17.240
[both chuckle]

20:34.324 --> 20:36.392
[grunting]

20:46.336 --> 20:49.439
[indistinct chatter]

21:00.550 --> 21:01.616
Come on, man.

21:01.618 --> 21:04.987
[grunting]

21:04.989 --> 21:05.990
Fuck.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.460
Get the fuck off me.
Get the fuck off me.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.727
[man] Ben?

21:12.729 --> 21:13.730
Yo?

21:14.798 --> 21:15.799
Ben!

21:17.101 --> 21:18.567
- Ben.
- Yo?

21:18.569 --> 21:19.570
Get up.

21:21.005 --> 21:22.006
[man] Ben?

21:28.012 --> 21:29.647
[Callahan speaking Arabic]

21:31.015 --> 21:32.648
[speaking Arabic]
Stop.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.351
[speaking Arabic]
Get down.

21:34.752 --> 21:38.787
[speaking Arabic]

21:38.789 --> 21:39.890
[phone rings]

21:43.828 --> 21:44.929
Callahan.

21:46.997 --> 21:48.065
What?

21:49.867 --> 21:52.938
[indistinct radio chatter]

21:58.742 --> 22:01.712
[indistinct chatter]

22:04.114 --> 22:05.851
[officer] Get back.
Thank you.

22:10.554 --> 22:11.555
[Callahan] Tell me.

22:12.923 --> 22:14.725
[officer] He slammed
Ben Daley's head into a urinal.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.927
- Your brother's record...
- Yeah, I know.

22:17.929 --> 22:20.529
- And fleeing the scene...
- I'll find him, all right?

22:20.531 --> 22:23.969
Just let me find him first.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.472
[indistinct radio chatter]

22:37.082 --> 22:38.382
Oyster!

22:49.127 --> 22:51.593
- Baker Six to headquarters.
- [officer] <i>Go ahead, Baker Six.</i>

22:51.595 --> 22:53.930
Yeah, I got that Bronco
at 35 Riverside Drive.

22:53.932 --> 22:54.900
[officer] Copy that.

23:12.784 --> 23:14.119
Teddy, get out here.

23:17.757 --> 23:19.256
Hear me out, all right?

23:19.258 --> 23:20.891
- [Callahan] I'm listening. Yeah.
- All right.

23:20.893 --> 23:22.226
- There were two of them.
- [Callahan] Uh-huh.

23:22.228 --> 23:23.227
They fucking jumped him,
all right?

23:23.229 --> 23:24.093
- That's great.
- It was self-defense, brother.

23:24.095 --> 23:25.094
He can explain
at the fucking station.

23:25.096 --> 23:27.032
[Snowball] You're gonna
fucking arresting him?

23:28.266 --> 23:29.266
What do you think I gotta do?
I gotta fucking take him in.

23:29.268 --> 23:31.068
You're not gonna fucking
take him to the station.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.004
- Talk to him.
- He explain it

23:33.005 --> 23:34.004
- at the fucking station.
- [Snowball] You think

23:34.006 --> 23:34.570
- they're gonna believe him, Cal?
- What's that?

23:34.572 --> 23:36.042
What the fuck is that?

23:36.975 --> 23:37.976
Huh?

23:38.743 --> 23:39.976
What's he gonna do,
jump the border?

23:39.978 --> 23:42.079
What are you... What the fuck
are you doing getting involved?

23:42.081 --> 23:43.948
Why are you behaving
like a fucking cop?

23:43.950 --> 23:45.615
- I am a fucking cop.
- He's your fucking brother.

23:45.617 --> 23:46.582
Sit down, all right?

23:46.584 --> 23:48.618
Just sit down
and stay out of it, please.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.688
Teddy, get out here.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.693
He's got your fucking passport,
bro, come out here.

23:55.695 --> 23:56.927
- Sit the fuck.
- Yeah, I fucking heard you.

23:56.929 --> 23:57.795
All right?

23:57.797 --> 23:58.729
- What are you thinking?
- Give it to me.

23:58.731 --> 24:00.232
[Snowball] All right.
Easy. Easy, guys.

24:01.466 --> 24:02.598
- Don't fucking... No, no, no.
- What the fuck are you thinking?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.234
- [Snowball] Hey. Hey.
- You can't run from this shit.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.138
- Easy. Easy.
- All right?

24:06.106 --> 24:06.704
What do you think's
gonna fucking happen?

24:06.706 --> 24:08.005
- Look, Oyster!
- Fuck.

24:08.007 --> 24:10.274
[sirens wailing]

24:10.276 --> 24:11.477
[Callahan] Fuck.

24:15.680 --> 24:16.782
[Oyster] Motherfucker.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.550
Get the fuck off me!

24:19.552 --> 24:20.951
No, no, no. Cal.

24:20.953 --> 24:22.953
[Oyster]
You stupid motherfucker!

24:22.955 --> 24:25.124
I told you they're gonna
fucking take me to jail.

24:25.891 --> 24:28.593
You fucking loser!
You fucking fuck!

24:28.996 --> 24:31.131
- You stupid motherfucker!
- [officer] Hey.

24:31.597 --> 24:32.763
[Oyster] You know they're gonna
put me in there!

24:32.765 --> 24:34.765
- [Callahan] Take it easy.
- You fucking piece of shit.

24:34.767 --> 24:35.801
All right?

24:36.569 --> 24:38.602
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:38.604 --> 24:39.772
Come on. Calm down.

24:43.110 --> 24:45.112
Ben Daley just passed away.

24:47.947 --> 24:51.982
[Oyster] No, no, no.
Oh, God. No. Fuck. No.

24:51.984 --> 24:53.585
Hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:53.587 --> 24:54.552
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:54.554 --> 24:55.922
- [Oyster] No, no, no.
- That's my brother.

24:56.323 --> 25:01.694
No, no, no! No, no!
Get your hands off me!

25:01.894 --> 25:02.895
No!

25:03.596 --> 25:04.863
Get your fucking hands off me!

25:04.865 --> 25:07.100
No! No!

25:07.601 --> 25:09.603
Look at me.
Look at me.

25:09.836 --> 25:12.873
Fuck!
You stupid fucking animal!

25:13.706 --> 25:15.142
[engine starts]

25:17.978 --> 25:22.215
[siren wailing]

25:40.333 --> 25:44.571
[helicopter whirring]

25:58.119 --> 26:01.955
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:08.029 --> 26:09.195
Good.

26:09.197 --> 26:10.728
I just wanna point out
real quick

26:10.730 --> 26:12.098
that we're pulling
fucking security

26:12.100 --> 26:14.335
for porta potties, man.
Are you aware of that?

26:15.168 --> 26:16.737
Get the fuck back up there.

26:16.971 --> 26:20.973
[helicopter whirring]

26:20.975 --> 26:24.845
[soldiers chanting indistinctly]

26:28.916 --> 26:30.683
- [Snowball] Go, go, go.
- Up, up. More, more, more.

26:30.685 --> 26:32.218
- More, more, more.
- Level with the window.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.086
Snowball, put some
dick skin on it, bro.

26:34.088 --> 26:34.954
[Snowball] Working on it.

26:34.956 --> 26:36.989
[Jaeger] Fuck.
Fucking piece of shit.

26:36.991 --> 26:38.993
Couldn't they give us
real fucking shovels?

26:39.260 --> 26:41.361
I've had fucking hard-ons
bigger than this thing.

26:41.363 --> 26:42.329
One more.

26:42.331 --> 26:43.298
[Snowball] That's a fucking lie.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.931
You know, Animal Company 17's
first sergeant

26:45.933 --> 26:47.900
made 'em do 150,000 of these.

26:47.902 --> 26:50.035
- Fuck.
- [Jaeger] Why, why?

26:50.037 --> 26:52.006
Oh, they burned down
their guard shack smoking.

26:52.907 --> 26:54.441
- [laughing]
- Shucked the shack.

26:54.443 --> 26:55.643
Fuck off.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.323
[indistinct chatter]

27:13.428 --> 27:15.029
[soldier] One, two three.

27:24.506 --> 27:27.708
Yo, Cal, who's that?
Is that Captain Vera?

27:38.220 --> 27:39.386
[gates open]

27:39.388 --> 27:41.957
[metal clanking]

27:42.424 --> 27:43.959
[guard]
Put your fucking foot down.

27:44.359 --> 27:45.727
Turn around.

27:49.364 --> 27:50.731
[door opens]

27:52.066 --> 27:53.303
[buzzer sounds]

28:12.454 --> 28:16.458
[beeping]

28:16.858 --> 28:19.795
[indistinct chatter]

28:36.546 --> 28:37.746
Quiet.

28:41.217 --> 28:42.819
Pull up your fucking jumpsuit.

28:44.254 --> 28:48.289
I want all this shit
off of this railing now!

28:48.291 --> 28:51.091
You got five seconds
or it's mine!

28:51.093 --> 28:55.965
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:57.233 --> 28:58.434
[laughing]

29:02.338 --> 29:03.539
Something funny, fellas?

29:06.075 --> 29:07.377
Who wants to tell me a joke?

29:09.112 --> 29:09.912
How about you?

29:10.913 --> 29:12.781
You got some funny jokes
you wanna tell?

29:12.982 --> 29:13.983
No, sir.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.132
[Callahan] Bring it in.

29:31.134 --> 29:33.136
School circle on the LT.

29:34.003 --> 29:37.639
[lieutenant] Listen up, gents.
We are losing Marines to IEDs.

29:37.641 --> 29:39.242
Now, this is an ECM.

29:39.942 --> 29:43.078
The ECM is gonna jam any
wireless signal for 300 meters.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.079
That means the Haji
should not be able to command

29:45.081 --> 29:46.082
detonate any of their IEDs.

29:47.016 --> 29:49.317
Sir, we still plan to keep
on the IPs in the dark

29:49.319 --> 29:51.020
- until we step off?
- No.

29:52.121 --> 29:54.356
Higher up wants us to treat
the Iraqi police

29:54.358 --> 29:55.624
like a partner force.

29:55.626 --> 29:58.627
So, that's what we're gonna do.

29:58.629 --> 30:00.196
Are we good to go?

30:00.930 --> 30:02.330
[soldiers groaning]

30:02.332 --> 30:03.333
[lieutenant] Dismiss.

30:05.102 --> 30:06.437
[metal clanking]

30:08.906 --> 30:10.105
- [Snowball] Ready?
- Hit it.

30:10.107 --> 30:12.407
- One, two, three.
- [radio static]

30:12.409 --> 30:13.575
- [groaning]
- You fucking suck.

30:13.577 --> 30:14.911
[Snowball] That sucks, man.

30:15.312 --> 30:16.980
Oh, Jesus.

30:17.281 --> 30:19.183
[Snowball] It's gonna fucking
annoy them to death.

30:24.021 --> 30:25.920
All right. What? This is it?
Where are the rest of the IPs?

30:25.922 --> 30:27.358
These are their team leaders.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.126
[sighs] Fuck me.
Okay. All right.

30:31.128 --> 30:32.296
All right, listen up.

30:34.298 --> 30:36.231
Who here is more loyal
to the Mahdi militia

30:36.233 --> 30:37.566
than to your own country, huh?

30:37.568 --> 30:38.868
Raise your hand.

30:39.069 --> 30:41.573
[translator speaking Arabic]

30:42.474 --> 30:48.009
I don't care if you're Shia,
Sunni, Baathist, all right?

30:48.011 --> 30:51.215
Your loyalty
is now to the Iraqi police.

30:52.015 --> 30:54.452
Now, somehow, the militia,
they know our routes.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.488
They know our departure times.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.521
We can't have it, okay?

30:58.523 --> 31:01.423
So, from this point on,
you're gonna go on missions

31:01.425 --> 31:03.260
alongside us. You got it?

31:03.460 --> 31:07.998
[translator speaking Arabic]

31:11.269 --> 31:12.535
Good. All right.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.204
[metal clanking]

31:33.124 --> 31:34.459
What do you want me to see?

31:42.200 --> 31:44.369
Is he putting fucking apples
into the pancakes?

31:45.738 --> 31:48.072
Fucking sneaking snacks
to his friends.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.411
Where the fuck
did he get an apple from?

31:59.484 --> 32:00.485
Come on.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.421
Am I in trouble?

32:04.155 --> 32:05.691
You're not in trouble, kid.
Get over there.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.094
- [Oyster] Over here?
- [guard] Yeah.

32:11.329 --> 32:12.595
That's good enough.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.263
Look, the boys and me,

32:14.265 --> 32:16.702
we saw you making
those apple pancakes.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.736
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I was just trying...

32:19.738 --> 32:22.006
- Somebody was talking...
- Shut up.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.507
They look good.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.208
The inmates aren't gonna
help you in here.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.442
The guards
are gonna help you.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.044
So, if you wanna do
something special,

32:28.046 --> 32:29.148
you take care of the guards.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.484
And then we take care of you.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.687
Which is why you're here.
All right?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.688
I got two boys outside.
They got birthdays coming up.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.491
How about you make
some apple pies for them?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.828
You can do it,
a couple of apple pies?

32:43.830 --> 32:45.431
You want me to... Yes, sir.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.466
Okay.
So, what do you need?

32:47.766 --> 32:51.334
Uh, for apple pies, apples.

32:51.336 --> 32:53.072
All right, grab some apples.

32:53.607 --> 32:55.673
You know what, put them in those
sacks right there.

32:55.675 --> 32:56.675
Yeah, sure.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.542
Put three or four on one side,

32:58.544 --> 33:00.145
put three or four
on the other side.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.382
Here's one.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.117
Boys.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.223
Happy birthday, boys.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.724
And what else do you need
for the pie?

33:13.726 --> 33:15.094
Not just apples, huh?

33:16.763 --> 33:20.099
Yeah, I probably need
some, uh, cinnamon.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.332
Is it your birthday?
Or one of your birthdays?

33:22.334 --> 33:23.567
[guard] Yeah, both of them
got birthdays

33:23.569 --> 33:24.802
- coming up, yeah.
- Cool.

33:24.804 --> 33:26.637
So, we're going to need...
What did you say?

33:26.639 --> 33:27.704
- I just...
- Cinnamon?

33:27.706 --> 33:28.840
Cinnamon, yeah, sugar.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.675
- Sugar, cinnamon, sugar.
- Butter, milk.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.644
Boys, hold the bags open,
he's got a lot more

33:32.646 --> 33:34.414
to put in there.
Sugar is right over here.

33:34.748 --> 33:36.313
Yeah, how much you need?

33:36.315 --> 33:37.316
Uh...

33:37.751 --> 33:40.787
[grunting]

33:45.392 --> 33:46.591
[groans]

33:46.593 --> 33:47.827
Oh, fuck!

33:53.667 --> 33:56.701
[indistinct radio chatter]

33:56.703 --> 34:00.405
[radio static]

34:00.407 --> 34:02.574
The IED jammer
is fucking with our comms.

34:02.576 --> 34:04.442
I don't think hitting it's
gonna help.

34:04.444 --> 34:05.846
Yeah, but it makes me
feel better.

34:07.247 --> 34:08.880
Hey, guys.
Remember that time

34:08.882 --> 34:10.648
when the recruiter
promised us cool missions,

34:10.650 --> 34:13.717
like delivering shit paper
to a bunch of action movie guys?

34:13.719 --> 34:14.918
- [laughs]
- [Milk] <i>I heard that.</i>

34:14.920 --> 34:17.155
[Callahan] <i>What would you
rather do, firewatch?</i>

34:17.157 --> 34:18.222
- [Jaeger] <i>No.</i>
- Yo,

34:18.224 --> 34:19.525
where'd the Iraqi police go?

34:20.427 --> 34:22.228
Yo, those motherfuckers
peeled off.

34:23.597 --> 34:25.228
Nick 2, this is Nick 4.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.797
<i>Nick 2, this is Nick 4.</i>

34:26.800 --> 34:28.233
This way?

34:28.235 --> 34:29.670
[explosion]

34:30.670 --> 34:31.770
[man] <i>Holy shit.</i>

34:31.772 --> 34:34.639
Contact front.
Standby for blood.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.708
[indistinct shouting]

34:36.710 --> 34:38.178
[Man] Go, go.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.213
Twenty-five and five,
punch out.

34:41.215 --> 34:42.617
Set up security.

34:42.882 --> 34:44.181
[indistinct chatter]

34:44.184 --> 34:45.248
Hey.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.619
Eyes on that gun!

34:46.621 --> 34:48.355
Cover that dead space.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.123
Run some security.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.659
Cover that overhead.

34:53.828 --> 34:56.695
I'm here. I'm here, brother.
I'm here. I got you.

34:56.697 --> 34:59.366
- Jaeger... Hey, hey.
- [groans]

34:59.667 --> 35:01.900
Focus on me.
Hey. Just breathe.

35:01.902 --> 35:03.668
Find me a CCP.

35:03.670 --> 35:05.371
We need these Marines
off the street.

35:05.373 --> 35:06.739
- [grunting]
- Stay with me, okay?

35:06.741 --> 35:09.208
That's it. Okay. I got you.

35:09.210 --> 35:11.275
- Is my dick okay?
- Your dick is fine.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.211
- Focus on me.
- [screams]

35:13.213 --> 35:14.247
Okay.

35:15.315 --> 35:16.983
I'm gonna need a CASEVAC,
stand by for night line.

35:16.985 --> 35:18.484
- [Callahan] Stay with me, okay?
- Shit.

35:18.486 --> 35:19.687
[Callahan] Okay. I got you.

35:20.388 --> 35:21.389
Here.

35:22.790 --> 35:24.323
What? What?

35:24.325 --> 35:26.458
[whispering]

35:26.460 --> 35:27.993
I'll take it from here,
Sergeant Callahan.

35:27.995 --> 35:29.230
On you.

35:30.498 --> 35:31.664
Go, go, go, go.

35:31.666 --> 35:32.798
[Jaeger] Wait, Cal.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.735
Get that bird inbound.

35:35.703 --> 35:37.638
Copenhagen, Copenhagen.

35:38.239 --> 35:39.938
- [Milk] Get the fuck down here.
- All right, all right.

35:39.940 --> 35:42.575
What the fuck are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

35:42.577 --> 35:44.510
- [speaking Arabic]
- What's going on?

35:44.512 --> 35:45.845
[man speaking Arabic]

35:45.847 --> 35:47.446
[speaking Arabic]

35:47.448 --> 35:48.514
Milk, where's his bed?

35:48.516 --> 35:50.582
Fuck, he didn't...
He didn't fucking sleep here.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.852
- [speaking Arabic]
- No fucking bed up here, bro.

35:52.854 --> 35:54.888
- What's he saying?
- [speaks Arabic]

35:54.890 --> 35:57.356
Hey. Hey.
Where is your bed?

35:57.358 --> 35:59.658
- [speaking Arabic]
- Hey, if you're sleeping

35:59.660 --> 36:00.860
show me your bed.

36:00.862 --> 36:02.928
- Hey. Where is your bed?
- [speaking Arabic]

36:02.930 --> 36:03.931
You trigger that?

36:04.966 --> 36:05.999
- Did you trigger that shit?
- [speaking Arabic]

36:06.001 --> 36:06.034
- Where is your fucking bed?
- [speaking Arabic]

36:07.102 --> 36:07.467
You trigger that shit?
Where is your fucking bed?

36:07.469 --> 36:09.336
[gunshot]

36:22.484 --> 36:27.455

[jet engine roars]

37:49.605 --> 37:51.741
- How is he?
- [Callahan] He's alive.

37:53.076 --> 37:54.343
[exhales]

38:08.524 --> 38:10.426
- It's the last house.
- I know.

38:19.635 --> 38:20.904
[sighs]

38:21.805 --> 38:22.805
Thanks.

38:28.111 --> 38:29.379
Congratulations.

38:32.448 --> 38:33.449
Thank you.

38:35.152 --> 38:36.887
Call me if you need anything.

38:37.854 --> 38:39.822
My practice
is only an hour away.

38:47.030 --> 38:48.431
[grunts]

39:12.055 --> 39:14.758
[indistinct chatter]

39:24.701 --> 39:25.769
[guard] You have a visitor.

39:26.603 --> 39:27.638
Who came to visit me?

39:28.740 --> 39:29.741
I don't fucking know.
Come read the fucking paper.

39:47.225 --> 39:48.393
No?

39:51.061 --> 39:52.196
Fine by me.

39:53.798 --> 39:54.832
It's been denied.

39:58.535 --> 40:00.939
[keys jingling]

40:13.517 --> 40:14.518

[phone beeping]

40:28.834 --> 40:30.601
[line ringing]

40:32.937 --> 40:34.806
- [Snowball] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Snowball.

40:35.573 --> 40:36.806
<i>You awake?</i>

40:36.808 --> 40:37.974
[Snowball] <i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

40:37.976 --> 40:39.043
[Callahan]
<i>I need your help.</i>

40:40.079 --> 40:41.546
[Snowball] <i>Yeah,
what do you need, man?</i>

40:42.081 --> 40:43.215
[door buzzes]

40:50.088 --> 40:53.056
I know, I know, I know.
Hear me out.

40:53.058 --> 40:56.061
Hear us out, right?
Listen, he just wants to talk.

40:57.029 --> 40:58.063
All right?

40:58.830 --> 41:00.163
And he wants to help.

41:00.165 --> 41:01.298
Uh-huh.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.633
Hear him out for me.

41:03.001 --> 41:04.801
Let's talk.
Let's go.

41:04.803 --> 41:06.672
- [Callahan] Is it okay?
- Sit down.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.041
Sit.

41:12.144 --> 41:14.012
Look, I don't think it's right.

41:14.612 --> 41:15.613
Fuck yeah.

41:16.749 --> 41:19.618
Okay. I don't think you deserve
this sentence and, uh...

41:20.686 --> 41:22.154
This an apology?

41:22.921 --> 41:24.754
You mean I don't need
to serve 25 years

41:24.756 --> 41:26.524
for fucking defending myself?

41:28.761 --> 41:30.127
Look, Clara says there's, uh,

41:30.129 --> 41:31.962
a second appeal
that we can go after.

41:31.964 --> 41:33.797
It's, uh...
It's kind of a long shot, but...

41:33.799 --> 41:35.665
No, the second appeal
is pre-denied.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.002
Nichols says
it's pre-denied.

41:38.237 --> 41:40.304
- It's pre-denied, bro?
- What do you mean? What?

41:40.306 --> 41:42.240
- Why are we pre-denied?
- Why are we pre-denied?

41:42.242 --> 41:44.676
What do you mean "we"?
Since when has it been "we"?

41:44.943 --> 41:45.944
Like you and me?

41:46.945 --> 41:47.878
Pre-denied? You're the one
that held me down

41:47.880 --> 41:48.814
because you wanted to
teach me a lesson.

41:50.082 --> 41:50.115
- Okay. That's not what happened.
- [Oyster] You're the one who's

41:51.016 --> 41:51.050
resented me
since I was a little kid.

41:52.118 --> 41:52.152
- And obviously that's why...
- [Callahan] Really?

41:54.120 --> 41:54.154
...you put me in there,
that's obviously...

41:55.355 --> 41:55.388
- This is not what I came here.
- ...why you held me down,

41:56.322 --> 41:56.853
because you can't
fucking deal with me.

41:56.855 --> 41:56.889
[Callahan chuckles]

41:57.890 --> 41:57.923
[Snowball] It's not what
we came here for, bro.

42:00.159 --> 42:00.957
Right? Because I'm...
I'm just a fuck up to you.

42:00.959 --> 42:01.526
- [Callahan] Bro...
- I'm a fuck up

42:01.528 --> 42:01.560
and I'm a loser to you.

42:02.694 --> 42:03.560
Bro, I did everything I could
to give you a shot.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.663
And you're fucking blaming me?
Really?

42:06.665 --> 42:07.999
- Everything you could...
- [Callahan] Everything I could.

42:08.001 --> 42:09.135
- ...to give me a shot.
- [Callahan] Yeah,

42:10.303 --> 42:10.336
- I did everything I could...
- Yeah, holding me down...

42:11.271 --> 42:11.902
[Callahan]
...and you're still a fuck up.

42:11.904 --> 42:11.937
...on the fucking ground,

42:13.072 --> 42:15.072
you're holding me down,
that's everything you could...

42:15.074 --> 42:15.107
Oh, you're gonna
blame me for that?

42:16.209 --> 42:16.242
- Yeah, I'm gonna blame you.
- You're gonna blame me?

42:17.210 --> 42:17.243
I'm gonna blame you.
You could've let me go!

42:18.244 --> 42:18.278
- I worked my ass off...
- You could've let me go!

42:20.146 --> 42:20.180
- ...to be your legal guardian...
- Guys?

42:21.047 --> 42:21.778
- ...and what do you fucking do?
- Guys!

42:21.780 --> 42:21.814
- You throw shit at me!
- Guys.

42:23.049 --> 42:24.082
- I didn't throw shit at you.
- You know, I worked my ass off

42:24.084 --> 42:27.351
to be your legal guardian.
You understand that?

42:27.353 --> 42:29.722
That ever occur to you,
you know?

42:29.989 --> 42:31.222
Who the fuck fed you?

42:31.224 --> 42:32.957
Who the fuck put
the fucking lights on?

42:32.959 --> 42:34.392
Guys, let's not do this.

42:34.394 --> 42:36.427
It was me, all right?

42:36.429 --> 42:37.796
Why do you think I didn't go
active duty?

42:38.997 --> 42:39.997
- You think that was for me?
- I don't wanna hear how much

42:39.999 --> 42:40.965
you resent me anymore.
I don't feel like it!

42:40.967 --> 42:42.702
- I don't resent you!
- Why are you coming here

42:43.870 --> 42:44.669
- to make me feel like shit!
- I'm just saying I fucking

42:44.671 --> 42:45.537
- sacrificed a lot...
- Guys, guys!

42:45.539 --> 42:46.537
...and you're fucking
throwing shit...

42:46.539 --> 42:48.339
- This is not an apology!
- [Snowball] Whoa, whoa!

42:48.341 --> 42:49.440
I'm the one
who's stuck in here!

42:49.442 --> 42:51.175
- [guard] Visitation is over.
- Good.

42:51.177 --> 42:52.743
- It's over, happy?
- [Snowball] Sir...

42:52.745 --> 42:54.879
[guard] Sir, I'm sorry.
I apologize, visitation is over.

42:54.881 --> 42:55.882
It's over.

42:58.251 --> 42:59.786
- [sighs]
- Get up.

43:01.821 --> 43:02.889
Let's go.

43:03.958 --> 43:05.025
Wait right here.

43:05.226 --> 43:06.926
Keep your chin up
in there, okay?

43:08.895 --> 43:10.761
Yo, why is your chest
all fucked up?

43:10.763 --> 43:12.029
Hey, back way from the inmate.
Back off, sir.

43:12.031 --> 43:14.932
- No contact with the inmates.
- There's bruises on his chest.

43:14.934 --> 43:17.436
I'm sorry, sir, you cannot touch
the inmate, back up, please.

43:17.438 --> 43:19.004
No contact with the inmates.

43:19.006 --> 43:20.439
Let's go, I'm sorry.

43:20.441 --> 43:21.939
Oyster,
who did that to you, bro?

43:21.941 --> 43:22.942
Oyster!

43:26.447 --> 43:28.849
- Jesus Christ.
- [knocking on door]

43:29.383 --> 43:30.851
[door buzzes]

43:31.318 --> 43:33.053
[door closes]

43:36.022 --> 43:37.023
[Callahan] Hey.

43:38.091 --> 43:39.960
- Who's the officer in charge?
- Sergeant Capros.

43:40.161 --> 43:42.261
- Yeah, I want a word with him.
- Regarding?

43:42.263 --> 43:44.296
- I wanna file a complaint.
- [guard] A complaint?

43:44.298 --> 43:48.068
- What's your complaint?
- I wanna file a complaint.

43:49.270 --> 43:52.037
- Go get Sergeant Capros.
- He's not around, pal.

43:52.039 --> 43:53.906
- Well, go find him, pal.
- [Snowball] All right.

43:53.908 --> 43:55.274
Hey, you need to get
the fuck out my face...

43:55.276 --> 43:56.341
- [Snowball] Come on, bro.
- ...pal.

43:56.343 --> 43:57.309
[Snowball] Thank you, sir.

43:57.311 --> 43:58.245
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.078
And don't never get in
my fucking face like that again.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.781
We got it, we got it, thank you.

44:02.782 --> 44:04.419
They need to know
what's going on, all right?

44:05.387 --> 44:07.119
I think they're the ones
doing it, bro.

44:07.121 --> 44:08.122
[sniffs]

44:08.756 --> 44:11.992
[indistinct radio chatter]

44:17.432 --> 44:21.035
[indistinct chatter]

44:26.974 --> 44:27.976
[Callahan] Nichols!

44:29.344 --> 44:30.378
Nichols!

44:30.978 --> 44:31.910
Hey, Cal.

44:31.912 --> 44:33.346
[Callahan]
What, you don't return my calls?

44:33.348 --> 44:34.848
No, I'm sorry.

44:35.082 --> 44:37.316
Listen, I filed the complaint
with the warden myself,

44:37.318 --> 44:39.184
but I need you to
do the petition of transfer.

44:39.186 --> 44:40.121
I know. I got it.

44:41.189 --> 44:41.988
- I got the message.
- No, ASAP, all right, okay?

44:41.990 --> 44:43.191
All right.
I got them, I got them.

44:44.326 --> 44:45.191
- I'm on it. I'm on it.
- No, I can't have him in there

44:45.193 --> 44:46.125
- a day longer.
- Right, I got... I got...

44:46.127 --> 44:48.263
Why was the second appeal
pre-denied, huh?

44:49.331 --> 44:51.497
The facts of the case
have been adjudicated already,

44:51.499 --> 44:53.566
but they're not gonna hear
a second appeal

44:53.568 --> 44:55.870
until there's new evidence.

44:56.338 --> 44:57.904
Our hands are tied,
that's it.

44:57.906 --> 44:59.241
What if, uh...

44:59.873 --> 45:01.443
What if Dwyer recants
his testimony?

45:03.077 --> 45:04.112
[sighs]

45:04.846 --> 45:05.979
Why would he do that?

45:05.981 --> 45:07.280
I don't...
I don't see it happening.

45:07.282 --> 45:08.450
No, but what if he did?

45:09.217 --> 45:12.087
[sighs] I'm sorry, Cal.
I'm really sorry.

45:12.320 --> 45:16.490
I did everything I could.
I'm... I got to go, okay?

45:16.492 --> 45:18.425
I... I'll file the request
for transfer

45:18.427 --> 45:20.462
first thing in the morning.
I got them, okay?

45:28.571 --> 45:30.036

[door buzzes]

45:39.314 --> 45:41.183
[guard] Not you, you stay.

45:44.620 --> 45:46.853
It would be a good idea
to deny any charges

45:46.855 --> 45:48.622
that you made against us.

45:48.624 --> 45:49.522
I didn't report anything,

45:49.524 --> 45:51.359
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:52.094 --> 45:54.261
- You are going to deny...
- I didn't report any...

45:54.263 --> 45:57.466
- ...any charges made against us.
- I didn't report anything.

45:57.866 --> 45:59.333
I didn't report anything,
I don't know anything

45:59.335 --> 46:01.067
about any charges, anybody
asked me anything, I won't...

46:01.069 --> 46:02.503
- No, no, we didn't say you.
- ...say a word.

46:02.505 --> 46:03.806
Your nutjob brother.

46:04.907 --> 46:05.839
[guard] He's a little shit bag
like you, ain't he?

46:05.841 --> 46:07.276
Don't you fucking talk
about my brother.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.348
We're done.

46:16.218 --> 46:20.890

[knocks on door]

46:32.902 --> 46:34.403
Hey, what's up, Stacey,
how you doing?

46:35.471 --> 46:37.340
- What's the problem?
- Oh, nothing.

46:37.939 --> 46:39.275
Uh, Dwyer here?

46:39.676 --> 46:41.844
- Why, what's he done?
- Just get him.

46:43.145 --> 46:44.146
Okay.

46:45.247 --> 46:46.248
D.J.!

46:47.917 --> 46:48.918
D.J.!

46:50.519 --> 46:52.220
- D.J.!
- [D.J.] <i>What?</i>

46:52.222 --> 46:53.423
Cal is here.

46:57.394 --> 46:58.660
What the fuck did you do?

46:58.662 --> 46:59.627
Man, chill out.

46:59.629 --> 47:01.128
What's up, Dwyer, how you doing?

47:01.130 --> 47:02.696
- Hey, what's up?
- Come out here.

47:02.698 --> 47:03.900
Let's have a chat.

47:04.835 --> 47:06.636
- What you want, man?
- Come and have a chat.

47:09.038 --> 47:10.938
Why'd you testify
against Oyster, hmm?

47:10.940 --> 47:11.941
[sighs]

47:13.543 --> 47:15.643
[sighs] They had possession
charges on me,

47:15.645 --> 47:17.645
threatening to go after me
if I didn't cooperate.

47:17.647 --> 47:18.648
Okay.

47:19.649 --> 47:21.949
I understand.
I can help you out with that.

47:21.951 --> 47:23.018
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

47:23.986 --> 47:25.285
I need you to do
something for me, all right?

47:25.287 --> 47:26.721
You got to recant
your testimony...

47:26.723 --> 47:27.922
- Stop.
- ...and say they pressured you.

47:27.924 --> 47:30.592
No, dude, I can't do that,
I can't go back to jail, man.

47:30.594 --> 47:32.494
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Look, they asked me if Oyster

47:32.496 --> 47:33.361
threatened to kill Daley,

47:33.363 --> 47:34.429
- he did say it, so...
- Just listen.

47:34.431 --> 47:36.698
...I said yes, man.
What the fuck are you doing?

47:36.700 --> 47:40.636
If you don't recant I will
fuck up your world, understand?

47:40.638 --> 47:42.572
- [groans]
- I will fuck up the rest of...

47:44.474 --> 47:47.177
Fuck. Get off me. Fuck.

47:47.477 --> 47:50.512
[groaning]

47:50.514 --> 47:52.383
[Stacey]
Get the fuck off of him!

47:54.351 --> 47:55.651
Fuck you, man!

47:55.653 --> 47:58.086
Fuck, fuck!
Fuck off, you fucking psycho!

47:58.088 --> 48:02.290
Get the fuck off my property!
Get the fuck off my property!

48:02.292 --> 48:04.193
- [D.J.] Fuck you!
- [Stacey] Get the fuck off

48:04.195 --> 48:05.093
of our property!

48:05.095 --> 48:06.697
- [D.J.] You psycho!
- [Stacey screams]

48:08.198 --> 48:10.367
[panting]

48:13.637 --> 48:16.973
[indistinct chatter]

48:19.109 --> 48:20.977
[officer] Dwyer's wife
is pressing charges.

48:22.012 --> 48:23.278
They want me to throw you
off the force.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.046
The DA used his
rap sheet to make him testify.

48:25.048 --> 48:26.448
And what am I supposed
to do is by...

48:26.450 --> 48:27.452
- [officer] Bullshit.
- That's coercion.

48:28.486 --> 48:28.919
It doesn't give you
the right to beat him up,

48:28.921 --> 48:30.021
this isn't Iraq.

48:33.123 --> 48:35.726
I can lean on Dwyer to drop
the charge against you.

48:36.527 --> 48:38.594
But I need to give you
a two-week suspension

48:38.596 --> 48:40.631
so you can screw your head
back on.

48:43.734 --> 48:45.001
How is he?

48:45.670 --> 48:46.970
He won't see me.

48:49.707 --> 48:51.139
I'll give the warden a call.

48:51.141 --> 48:53.311
Show up with your badge,
you'll get to see him.

48:54.245 --> 48:55.480
You're not gonna take my badge?

48:56.447 --> 48:57.715
Give me a break, Cal.

48:58.549 --> 49:00.751
You know we all think
his sentence is unfair.

49:03.822 --> 49:04.989
Thank you.

49:09.627 --> 49:10.793
[door buzzes]

49:10.795 --> 49:12.096
[door opens]

49:15.534 --> 49:16.602
How you doing?

49:18.604 --> 49:19.605
You all right?

49:23.775 --> 49:25.374
[sighs]

49:25.376 --> 49:28.647
We're, uh, working on a transfer
to La Belle.

49:29.548 --> 49:32.116
It's, uh...
It's down in Pennsylvania

49:33.251 --> 49:35.152
I figured me and the boys
will come visit.

49:37.555 --> 49:39.357
Did you really wanna
be my guardian?

49:43.262 --> 49:45.096
Because you could have been
my guardian when...

49:45.364 --> 49:48.232
you turned 18
but you waited two more years.

49:49.735 --> 49:52.371
I was a mess at 18, I was...

49:54.506 --> 49:58.277
I was drunk for a year
after Mom died.

49:59.176 --> 50:00.512
And I didn't wait. I was...

50:01.647 --> 50:03.616
I was trying to make it
through the police academy.

50:05.317 --> 50:08.086
[Oyster] And I told you that
he was doing shit to me.

50:14.660 --> 50:17.195
I was really clear about
what was going on.

50:21.767 --> 50:23.567
Yeah, I didn't know
who the fuck I was,

50:23.569 --> 50:24.868
let alone how to be your dad.

50:24.870 --> 50:27.138
I didn't need you to be my dad.
I just needed...

50:28.808 --> 50:30.577
you to be my brother. I just...

50:31.443 --> 50:34.346
I needed somebody
to joke around with or...

50:35.681 --> 50:37.681
you know,
be my wingman at the bar.

50:37.683 --> 50:39.517
Like telling me, you know,
some of the things

50:39.519 --> 50:42.453
that I was feeling
and thinking weren't weird

50:42.455 --> 50:43.854
or wrong, you know?

50:43.856 --> 50:45.858
I just needed someone
to have my back.

50:50.162 --> 50:53.366
[sighs] I'm sorry, Teddy, I am.
I'm...

50:55.802 --> 50:58.303
Do you remember what you said
when I totaled the Mazda?

50:59.806 --> 51:01.906
You came to visit me
in the hospital,

51:01.908 --> 51:03.843
and my arm was in a sling.

51:04.711 --> 51:09.282
And I said to you,
"I'm really sorry, Cal."

51:09.749 --> 51:11.618
And do you remember
what you said to me?

51:14.620 --> 51:16.589
You said,
"I do not accept your apology."

51:17.858 --> 51:19.390

51:24.931 --> 51:29.703

look like, huh, Milk?

Sorry, Sarge, you needed
new phone anyway, man.

Don't cry, you fucking dicks.

That shit's making me sad.

Oh, shit.
Well, now I am sorry.

- Yeah.

[Jaeger] Yeah. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

Where is this hangout?

57:53.325 --> 57:54.759
- [Clara] Hi.
- Hi.

57:55.193 --> 57:59.864
I, uh, heard
about you and... Stewart.

58:02.233 --> 58:04.803
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

58:08.173 --> 58:09.972
Seriously, did you drag her
into this or...

58:09.974 --> 58:11.207
How did you get her here?

58:11.209 --> 58:12.710
She's been
helping out for months.

58:13.077 --> 58:14.145
Yeah.

58:15.881 --> 58:18.181
Mostly legal stuff,
but help where I can.

58:18.183 --> 58:20.150
- What?
- Enjoy. Yeah.

58:20.152 --> 58:23.119
Jane Fonda's giving jarheads
free legal advice?

58:23.121 --> 58:25.087
- You serious?
- [Clara] Uh-huh.

58:25.089 --> 58:26.190
Amazing.

58:27.192 --> 58:29.294
- [Clara] It is. Yeah.
- What changed your mind?

58:30.662 --> 58:34.132
I haven't changed my mind.
It's still a stupid war.

58:38.103 --> 58:40.038
[Callahan] Do you like
my brother more than me?

58:42.707 --> 58:45.208
- [sighs] Of course not.
- Do you?

58:45.210 --> 58:47.377
- No.
- Hi, Cal.

58:47.379 --> 58:49.112
[Callahan]
'Cause I understand. I get it.

58:49.114 --> 58:51.648
I've been thinking.
He's a fun guy.

58:51.650 --> 58:52.385
[Jaeger sighs]

58:53.186 --> 58:55.287
- I'm not fun.
- You are fun, bro.

58:55.821 --> 58:57.854
- [Callahan] I love you.
- [Jaeger] I love you too.

58:57.856 --> 58:59.089
- [kisses]
- Yeah.

58:59.091 --> 59:01.024
He's my best friend.
He's my best friend.

59:01.026 --> 59:02.092
[Clara] I see that.

59:02.094 --> 59:03.329
He's in love with you. Shh.

59:05.964 --> 59:07.697
- That's my night, so...
- Wow.

59:07.699 --> 59:09.933
What? What did you say?

59:09.935 --> 59:11.000
Everybody's trying
to have a good time.

59:11.002 --> 59:12.368
- [Callahan] What?
- [man] You should take it easy.

59:12.370 --> 59:13.236
What's up? What, bro?

59:13.238 --> 59:14.771
- It's all good.
- That's what I thought.

59:14.773 --> 59:15.908
That's what I thought.

59:18.377 --> 59:19.742
[Jaeger] Now, what was that?

59:19.744 --> 59:21.214
It's all right.
It's all right.

59:21.414 --> 59:22.681
Sorry.

59:28.020 --> 59:30.289
- [car horns honking]
- [Callahan] Fuck you. Fuck you.

59:30.722 --> 59:32.158
[woman]
What the hell are you doing?

59:32.358 --> 59:34.358
[car horn honking]

59:34.360 --> 59:37.028
[Milk] Fuck. Sit down.

59:39.298 --> 59:41.100
- [Jaeger] Fuck.
- [Snowball] What the fuck?

59:41.968 --> 59:43.167
You good? You all right?

59:43.169 --> 59:44.902
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:44.904 --> 59:46.703
[Jaeger] Freaking leg
almost fell off.

59:46.705 --> 59:48.439
- [Callahan laughs]
- It's not fucking funny.

59:48.441 --> 59:50.209
What the fuck is wrong with you?

59:50.910 --> 59:53.412
Do not go
fucking dark on us, bro.

59:54.147 --> 59:57.316
We all got fucking problems.
All these boys.

59:59.851 --> 01:00:00.919
We need you.

01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.190
All right?

01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:09.262
Now, do you know how much
you mean to us, Cal?

01:00:14.733 --> 01:00:16.036
Now, you got us home.

01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:18.238
Yeah, he's right.

01:00:18.472 --> 01:00:21.107
- You got us home, Cal.
- [cries]

01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:25.011
- No, we love you.
- [cries]

01:00:27.881 --> 01:00:30.217
[sobbing]

01:00:33.219 --> 01:00:34.754
No, we're right here.

01:00:36.523 --> 01:00:38.024
We're not going anywhere.

01:00:41.328 --> 01:00:43.130
[laughing]

01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:45.863
The fuck are you looking at?

01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:47.465
You're good. You're good.

01:00:47.467 --> 01:00:48.899
- Wanna get up?
- [Callahan] Yeah.

01:00:48.901 --> 01:00:50.067
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:51.071
Help me up.

01:00:52.306 --> 01:00:53.104
[Snowball] Wanna sit on the
fucking Jamaican dirt all day?

01:00:53.106 --> 01:00:54.940
- [Jaeger] Come on.
- [Milk] Come on.

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:56.210
[grunts]

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:00.844
- [Jaeger] Come on.
- [Milk] Wanna go dance?

01:01:00.846 --> 01:01:02.012
- Yeah?
- [Jaeger] Yeah. Get some shots?

01:01:02.014 --> 01:01:03.482
[Callahan]
I'll move this dumpster.

01:01:03.484 --> 01:01:05.050
- [Jaeger] What?
- [Callahan] Yeah.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.418
[Milk] You wanna
move the dumpster?

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.286
- I'll move the dumpster.
- All right.

01:01:08.288 --> 01:01:09.487
- You're moving the dumpster?
- All right.

01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:11.323
[Callahan] Move the dumpster!

01:01:11.325 --> 01:01:12.424
Just move it.

01:01:12.426 --> 01:01:14.328
[Snowball] All right. Hold on.
Hold on.

01:01:14.995 --> 01:01:16.061
Go.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:17.297
[grunting]

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:20.332
[cheering]

01:01:20.334 --> 01:01:23.937
[laughing]

01:01:26.473 --> 01:01:28.341
[Jaeger] <i>Wait. No. Wait.
That wasn't me.</i>

01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:29.975
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:31.479
[laughing]

01:02:14.388 --> 01:02:18.092
[Callahan] <i>Just roll with me,
like 10 to 15...</i>

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.795
- Does this person have a record?
- No record.

01:02:23.264 --> 01:02:26.166
Okay. Five to eight.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.103
Maybe?
I'd say five to eight.

01:02:29.904 --> 01:02:32.872
Aiding and abetting,
of course trespassing,

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.240
destruction of state property.

01:02:34.242 --> 01:02:35.641
Consecutive sentences
can add up.

01:02:35.643 --> 01:02:37.276
Okay. So say it's non-violent.

01:02:37.278 --> 01:02:39.313
So what's that? A class C?

01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:40.316
[Clara] I don't know.

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:42.484
It would depend on the perp
and the circumstances...

01:02:43.418 --> 01:02:44.584
or juvenile rights practice.

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:46.285
I don't really have
a lot of experience

01:02:46.287 --> 01:02:48.888
in adult criminal cases.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.060
- Cal...
- Hmm.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.029
Why did you drive
all the way down here?

01:02:56.364 --> 01:02:58.433
I wanted to tell you something

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.135
that I thought
you might appreciate.

01:03:02.437 --> 01:03:06.506
Uh, right after, uh,
Jaeger got blown up,

01:03:06.508 --> 01:03:08.009
he was, uh...

01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:11.210
He was about to get lifted out

01:03:11.212 --> 01:03:15.150
and, uh, and right before
he passed out,

01:03:15.551 --> 01:03:18.287
I'm with him and, uh...

01:03:20.222 --> 01:03:23.690
he starts... I mean, he was...

01:03:23.692 --> 01:03:25.360
He just started
saying your name.

01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:29.565
A lot of times.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:32.468
And, uh...

01:03:34.536 --> 01:03:36.572
yeah, I just thought
you might like to know that.

01:03:37.706 --> 01:03:38.907
Mm-hmm.

01:03:44.179 --> 01:03:47.214
- [bowling pins clattering]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:03:47.216 --> 01:03:48.648
What's the fucking deal here?

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:51.319
Why are we called
like troops at 10:00 p.m.?

01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:54.087
Bring the boys here at 2200,
you know?

01:03:54.089 --> 01:03:55.257
[Milk] There he is.

01:03:56.158 --> 01:03:57.960
Hey, baby boy.
[chuckles]

01:03:58.193 --> 01:03:59.128
[Callahan] All right.

01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:00.893
[Snowball]
What's with the suspense, man?

01:04:00.895 --> 01:04:01.528
[Milk]
Pins and needles here, man.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.599
[Jaeger] Getting married?

01:04:03.633 --> 01:04:04.732
No. No. He's auditioning
for <i>American Idol.</i>

01:04:04.734 --> 01:04:07.267
[laughing]

01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:09.104
- [Milk] Motherfucker.
- [Jaeger] Cool.

01:04:10.172 --> 01:04:11.607
I'm gonna break him out.

01:04:13.509 --> 01:04:14.543
[Snowball chuckles]

01:04:17.147 --> 01:04:18.448
[Snowball]
Get the fuck out of here, man.

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:23.620
Cal, what are you
talking about, man?

01:04:24.219 --> 01:04:26.420
His, uh...
His transfer's been approved.

01:04:26.422 --> 01:04:28.389
I found out they're gonna
move him next week

01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:30.126
to La Belle, so...

01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:32.295
I'm gonna do it.

01:04:32.695 --> 01:04:34.431
It's five inmates, two COs.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.296
What the fuck?
What are you...

01:04:36.298 --> 01:04:37.299
What the fuck are you saying?

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:38.867
[Snowball] Bro, you're
fucking tripping, man.

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:40.568
Yeah, I can pull it off.

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:43.139
Get him across the border
before an APB goes out.

01:04:44.674 --> 01:04:46.443
Feds aren't gonna track him
to Canada.

01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:49.142
Are you being
fucking serious right now?

01:04:49.144 --> 01:04:51.345
You're gonna get fucking killed
is what you're gonna get.

01:04:51.347 --> 01:04:52.513
- Fucking listen to yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:54.248
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.584
We're all fucking here for you,
and we all fucking miss him.

01:04:56.586 --> 01:04:58.319
[Snowball] Yeah.
I miss him too, you know?

01:04:58.321 --> 01:04:59.320
We all do.

01:04:59.322 --> 01:05:02.356
[Milk] Let's get a fucking shot,
go to Gigi's,

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:04.494
- get you a fucking lap dance.
- [Snowball] Yeah.

01:05:04.728 --> 01:05:07.128
You need to get
fucking laid, bro.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:08.264
Yeah, man.

01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:10.400
I'm not asking.

01:05:13.303 --> 01:05:15.138
I don't need anything
from you guys.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.641
I wanted to let you know.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.011
Yeah, I just wanna let you know.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.748
- [Snowball] This is bullshit.
- [Jaeger] Cal.

01:05:28.686 --> 01:05:30.419
Go fucking talk to him.

01:05:30.421 --> 01:05:31.820
[Snowball] Yeah,
he'll listen to you.

01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:33.022
Fuck.

01:05:42.266 --> 01:05:44.401
[man over radio] <i>Snowball,
you taking a nap or what?</i>

01:05:46.336 --> 01:05:48.069

and, uh, I'm on board.</i>

[Milk] <i>What are you
fucking saying?</i>

01:06:23.607 --> 01:06:25.641
<i>You were supposed
to talk him out of it.</i>

01:06:25.643 --> 01:06:27.175
- He needs us.
- [Milk] You were supposed

01:06:27.177 --> 01:06:28.578
- to talk him out it.
- Couple years of jail

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.047
- is nothing to him.
- [Milk] Listen to me.

01:06:30.447 --> 01:06:32.683
Now, this isn't how
we do things.

01:06:33.484 --> 01:06:34.552
We love Cal.

01:06:35.753 --> 01:06:38.490
He's our fucking brother,
but this is fucking wrong, bro.

01:06:39.257 --> 01:06:41.524
- [Snowball] He's right.
- Oh, he's right?

01:06:41.526 --> 01:06:43.660
- [Snowball] Yeah.
- The fuck are you talking about?

01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:46.595
This is how we do things, Milk.
This is how we always...

01:06:46.597 --> 01:06:48.299
Dude, what are you saying to me?

01:06:50.234 --> 01:06:51.401
I'm in.

01:06:51.403 --> 01:06:52.769
- You're fucking in?
- Yeah, I'm in.

01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:53.836
- Fuck you.
- Yeah?

01:06:53.838 --> 01:06:55.473
You piece of shit.
We fucking...

01:06:55.774 --> 01:06:58.273
We... You fuckin' leave me
like this, you motherfucker.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:06:59.676
- Whoa. Chill.
- I'm not leaving you anywhere.

01:06:59.678 --> 01:07:00.642
Fuck you.

01:07:00.644 --> 01:07:02.144
I'm just fucking standing up
for Oyster, bro.

01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:03.446
He's gonna get fucking
killed in there.

01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:04.647
- You're right.
- He's gonna get killed in there.

01:07:04.649 --> 01:07:05.817
Somebody's gonna get
fucking killed.

01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:07.650
[Snowball] Well, at least this
is a fucking fighting chance.

01:07:07.652 --> 01:07:08.551
We owe him that much.

01:07:08.553 --> 01:07:10.853
Now, I failed him
in that fucking bar.

01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:12.722
I'm not gonna fail him again.

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:15.727
I'm not leaving him in there
25 years to fucking rot.

01:07:16.227 --> 01:07:17.093
Fuck that.

You do whatever
the fuck you want, man,

01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:20.532
but I'm in. I'm in.

01:07:21.299 --> 01:07:23.535
You guys are out
of your fucking mind.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:06.378
[train horn blares]

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.215
[Snowball] Putting him
on a train won't work, Cal.

01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:12.315
Even if the border patrol
let's them through

01:08:12.317 --> 01:08:13.585
before the APB goes out,

01:08:14.252 --> 01:08:16.587
his passport's gonna be
in the system, right?

01:08:16.589 --> 01:08:18.357
So they're gonna know
he's Canada.

01:08:19.224 --> 01:08:20.323
Check that out.

01:08:20.325 --> 01:08:22.358
See that refinery
across the river?

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:23.426
That's Sorko.

01:08:23.428 --> 01:08:24.828
That's my company's
sister refinery.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.832
I've been to the other side
just to work for a day.

01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:31.602
We take a crew boat
to Canada everyday

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:33.236
- without any border patrol.
- [Callahan] Hmm.

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:34.438
[Snowball] Listen,
don't get me wrong,

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:35.438
the security is tight,

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.841
but all we need to do
is get him on that boat

01:08:37.843 --> 01:08:40.810
with a uniform and an ID card,
a legit one which I can get,

01:08:40.813 --> 01:08:42.546
and then he can just walk out
on the other side.

01:08:42.548 --> 01:08:45.282
- He just swipes through?
- He swipes through. That's it.

01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:47.453
The company is just gonna think
he's another employee.

01:08:53.559 --> 01:08:55.895
- No fucking way.
- [Jaeger] Well, well, well.

01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:00.330
- [Snowball] Yo.
- How you doing, boys?

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:01.799
[Snowball] How the fuck
did you know we were here?

01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.202
You spying on us?

01:09:03.603 --> 01:09:06.807
- Jaeger.
- [Snowball] Oh, nice.

01:09:07.406 --> 01:09:08.407
You in?

01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:09.943
I'm in.

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:12.611
Are you sure?

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:18.250
[crickets chirping]

01:09:21.888 --> 01:09:22.819
[Callahan] <i>All right.</i>

01:09:22.822 --> 01:09:24.587
I want to run through this
one more time.

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.591
Eyes on, Jaeger.

01:09:25.991 --> 01:09:27.260
[Jaeger clears his throat]

01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:32.631
Okay. That's the overpass.

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:34.868
Now, this is the service road.

01:09:35.533 --> 01:09:38.368
And this is river road
coming underneath.

01:09:38.371 --> 01:09:40.671
That's fucking abandoned.
That becomes the highway.

01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:43.374
And we got trees
in this ravine.

01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:45.910
All right. Bus is gonna be
coming straight down here.

01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:48.479
It's gonna turn onto US 90,
okay?

01:09:48.481 --> 01:09:50.415
Now, Jaeger,
I want you posted up top.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:52.417
I need you to shoot out
the front right tire.

01:09:52.419 --> 01:09:53.685
- Yeah. All right.
- Okay? He's gonna feel

01:09:53.687 --> 01:09:54.986
way more than a flat
in the back.

01:09:54.988 --> 01:09:57.922
Once he hits the tire,
Milk, you jam the radio.

01:09:57.924 --> 01:09:59.958
All right? Now, you're
tailing the bus since prison,

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.593
<i>so don't get made,</i>

01:10:01.595 --> 01:10:02.962
<i>but don't fall
too far behind either.</i>

01:10:02.964 --> 01:10:05.097
I figure, what, you can see it,
you can jam it?

01:10:05.099 --> 01:10:06.431
- [Milk] You got it.
- Okay.

01:10:06.433 --> 01:10:08.833
I figure the bus
will come to a stop

01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:11.002
somewhere right around here.

01:10:11.004 --> 01:10:14.405
Me, I'm gonna be posted up here
under the overpass.

01:10:14.407 --> 01:10:16.341
I'll be tailing him
on the service road.

01:10:16.343 --> 01:10:18.710
Snowball, you'll be over here
on this road with me.

01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:20.445
Now, I'm gonna cut
through the trees,

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:21.813
drop a flare.

01:10:21.815 --> 01:10:23.782
I'll board
and extract Oyster.

01:10:23.784 --> 01:10:25.650
All right.
Now, once I get him to you,

01:10:25.652 --> 01:10:27.052
you gotta haul ass out of there.

01:10:27.054 --> 01:10:28.055
- Yeah.
- All right?

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.156
I'm gonna take him to the dock
and I'm gonna put him

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:31.356
on the 8:30 a.m.
Sorko ferry over to Canada.

01:10:31.358 --> 01:10:35.127
Takes about 10, 15 minutes,
so he should be scanning in

01:10:35.129 --> 01:10:38.697
on the Canadian side... [sighs]
...9:00 a.m. at the latest.

01:10:38.699 --> 01:10:41.068
- [Callahan] Badges good to go?
- [Snowball] Yeah. Looks good.

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:45.438
[sighs] All right.

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:10.565
[crickets chirping]

01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:20.508
[knocking at door]

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:26.013
[grunts]

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.382
[knocking at door]

01:11:30.852 --> 01:11:31.986
[Jaeger] What the fuck?

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:33.955
[spits]

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.861
Hey, what's up?
You okay?

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.698
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I need to talk in person.

01:11:44.565 --> 01:11:46.068
All right. What's the matter?

01:11:47.668 --> 01:11:50.873
I'm worried about Cal.
I think he's up to something.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.708
What? Why do you think that?

01:11:53.441 --> 01:11:56.078
He came to my office today
and gave me power of attorney,

01:11:56.778 --> 01:11:59.445
that means that I can sign
things for him if he dies.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:00.913
- Yeah. I know what it means.
- And the other night

01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:03.085
he was asking me about sentences
for a prison break.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.789
A prison break? [chuckles]
What are you talking about?

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.126
Did you know Oyster is getting
transferred tomorrow morning?

01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:16.230
Look, whatever you're thinking,
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:19.966
Just... I can't do this
right now, okay?

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.635
I got to get up early.
I'm sorry.

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:22.938
No. You're right.
It's okay.

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.774
I, uh... I'm sorry I came over
without calling.

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:29.078
What time you have to get up?

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.478
Uh, 7:30.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.480
I got the early shift
at the garage.

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.048
[Clara]
So you're alarm's set for 7:30?

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.583
- Yeah.
- [Clara] 7:15?

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:37.886
- Yeah.
- [Clara] Which is it?

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.423
What?

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:46.061
Clara.
Clara, what's going on?

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.062
Why are you cleaning your rifle?

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.934
What the fuck?
I'm going on a hunting trip.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.968
So you hunt with a silencer.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.568
Jesus. Enough. What is this?

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.941
This is insane.
You're going to get caught.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:03.644
- What do you care?
- I care... I care about Cal.

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:04.645
Maybe I don't wanna
see him get hurt.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:05.882
- Oh, you care about Cal?
- And I care about you.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.215
Well, why don't go fucking go
to stupid old Cal's bedroom?

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.083
Maybe I don't wanna see you
doing something stupid.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:11.018
- Ow. Fuck. Shit.
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.085
No. Nothing. It's fine.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:14.924
I just, uh...
I got a little shrapnel.

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.192
Fuck.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.159
- [Clara] I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not you.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:21.028
Will you get those, um...
Some tweezers

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.464
on the table there?

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:24.067
[groans]

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:33.042
Just fucking sometimes
I step on it wrong.

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:37.713
[Jaeger winces]

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:39.747
[Clara] Do you need help?

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.751
- [Jaeger] No. I got it.
- [sighs]

01:13:42.319 --> 01:13:44.318
- Let me help you.
- [Jaeger] No. It's fine.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.886
- I can do it.
- I got it.

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.090
I have a better angle.

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:49.993
Pull your shorts up.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.600
Yeah. [winces]

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:59.902
- Does it hurt?
- No. Feels great.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:03.573
- [groans]
- I'm sorry.

01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:06.576
[Jaeger winces]

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:12.615
[Jaeger] You got it.

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:23.260
Thanks.

01:14:45.249 --> 01:14:46.714
[inhales deeply]

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:47.717
[chuckles]

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.230
[Snowball exhales]

01:15:40.238 --> 01:15:41.973
[Milk] There's four channels.

01:15:42.273 --> 01:15:44.775
Now, you turn the knobs
to adjust for frequency...

01:15:45.843 --> 01:15:46.944
then press enter.

01:16:16.774 --> 01:16:17.942
[knocks on door]

01:16:23.348 --> 01:16:25.214
The fuck are you
doing here, hmm?

01:16:25.216 --> 01:16:26.483
- No. No.
- Take it easy.

01:16:26.485 --> 01:16:27.750
- Take it easy.
- [Callahan] Jaeger?

01:16:27.752 --> 01:16:28.720
- Calm down.
- Jaeger?

01:16:29.687 --> 01:16:30.920
Calm down. Shh. Shh.
Keep your voice down.

01:16:30.922 --> 01:16:32.358
- No. Fuck this. Fuck, Clara...
- Listen, I'll be his alibi.

01:16:33.024 --> 01:16:35.160
If he needs one, God forbid...

01:16:36.828 --> 01:16:38.063
I'm his alibi.

01:16:40.832 --> 01:16:41.866
Now, listen...

01:16:43.768 --> 01:16:45.036
you bring him back to me.

01:16:45.404 --> 01:16:46.671
You hear me?

01:17:07.059 --> 01:17:08.027
[door opens]

01:17:11.197 --> 01:17:12.298
[guard] Let's go.

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:29.949
[Callahan]
Where the fuck is Milk?

01:17:30.282 --> 01:17:31.481
- He's out.
- [Callahan] What?

01:17:31.483 --> 01:17:32.549
[Jaeger] What?

01:17:32.551 --> 01:17:33.951
Yeah. He's out. He's out.

01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:35.018
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:35.953
He's out?

01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:37.521
- Listen. Listen. Listen.
- [Jaeger] Rachel?

01:17:37.523 --> 01:17:38.724
- No, no, no, no.
- Dude, he's got a family.

01:17:39.626 --> 01:17:40.059
It doesn't matter right now,
all right?

01:17:41.093 --> 01:17:41.892
I got the jammer.
I can operate it, all right?

01:17:41.894 --> 01:17:42.793
- [sighs]
- I can do both, all right?

01:17:42.795 --> 01:17:45.229
I'll scope it out.
I'll fucking jam it.

01:17:45.231 --> 01:17:46.129
I'll be the getaway car.

01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:47.431
- [Jaeger] Cal, he's right.
- We're good.

01:17:47.433 --> 01:17:48.565
We're gonna make this work.

01:17:48.567 --> 01:17:49.968
[Callahan] This is not
fucking good.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.236
This is not fucking good.

01:17:51.238 --> 01:17:53.003
All right?
Your vehicle can't get IDed.

01:17:53.005 --> 01:17:54.006
This is a fucking disaster.

01:17:54.907 --> 01:17:55.640
[Snowball]
You're the overpass, right?

01:17:55.642 --> 01:17:56.206
- Yeah.
- [Snowball] I can jam it

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:56.940
- from there.
- Yeah.

01:17:56.942 --> 01:17:58.476
If I can see it,
I can jam it.

01:17:58.478 --> 01:17:59.479
That's even fucking better, bro.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:00.714
[Jaeger] And I'll go with you
when you take Oyster out.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.480
[Snowball] As soon as you
shoot out at that tire,

01:18:02.482 --> 01:18:02.947
I'm fucking down there with you.

01:18:02.949 --> 01:18:05.116
- Fuck!
- Hey!

01:18:05.118 --> 01:18:06.117
[Snowball] Hey. Hey.
Focus. Focus, all right?

01:18:06.119 --> 01:18:07.884
- Are we calling this?
- [Snowball] We're not...

01:18:07.886 --> 01:18:09.187
- [Jaeger] No.
- We're not fucking calling it.

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:10.120
[Snowball]
The plan stays the same.

01:18:10.122 --> 01:18:12.155
You should get him off that bus,
all right?

01:18:12.157 --> 01:18:13.192
We'll get him across.

01:18:14.494 --> 01:18:16.928
All right.
Big Bird's wheels up at 0700.

01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:18.098
See you there.

01:18:19.432 --> 01:18:21.167
I'll see you. I'll see you.

01:18:30.076 --> 01:18:30.977
[door clanking]

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:34.878
[guard] Turn around.
Face the wall.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.881
[buzzer sounds]

01:18:40.488 --> 01:18:42.255
[engine starts]

01:18:49.095 --> 01:18:50.131
[gunshot]

01:19:09.182 --> 01:19:10.884
[buzzer sounds]
