WEBVTT

00:39.289 --> 00:42.792
And after that,
l played the nurse in Romeo and Jiliet.

00:43.419 --> 00:49.298
And after that l played Dorine the maid
in Tartuffe by Molière.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.011
And l guess that's it.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.096
Thank you, Hillary.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.640
l'd love it if you could do the twist
one more time.

01:05.149 --> 01:08.693
Thank you, Hillary. We'll let you know.

01:12.156 --> 01:16.826
Harry, you are not in this process.
You're a spectator. Don't forget it.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.997
Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday
to see if Daiquiri Beach has legs.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.708
Don wants copy Monday morning
and art Monday night.

01:23.792 --> 01:28.212
-We should probably have the whole team.
-This weekend? No.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.256
l'm sorry, but we just heard about it.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.968
-Bullshit.
-l have plans. l really do.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.765
Well, l would love to work all weekend,
but l'm just a spectator.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.016
Whose crack did it fall through?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.518
Because you are going
to spend the weekend being our slave.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.271
-No finger-pointing.
-The bad news is

01:45.355 --> 01:48.941
they need five more vacation situations
for Bacardi rum.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.444
The good news is
we're going to be out of your hair.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.863
Jane and Roger Sterling's
garden party on the island.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.949
-Derby day.
-You're going back in time?

01:57.034 --> 01:58.493
Are any of you wearing seersucker?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.203
l don't want to look like
a barbershop quartet.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.497
-You're all going?
-l really wish l wasn't.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.333
Well, then don't. Give me your glasses.
l'll go as you.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.043
Sorry about that.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.630
-Good luck, gentles.
-Sorry.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.468
You know, we all started at the same time.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.846
-l've been here six years longer than you.
-They hate creative.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.278
My goodness.
l didn't expect to see you here.

02:34.363 --> 02:37.323
-For a little while longer.
-Lovely to see you, Jane,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.200
l mean Mrs. Sterling.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.791
l'll catch up with you, girls.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.128
l just stopped by.
Roger had my rings resized.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.340
l keep losing weight.
Where are you living now?

02:54.424 --> 02:58.177
Same old place, but we're looking.
We're thinking about Riverdale.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.638
lt's near Columbia Pres
and Greg wants a yard.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.350
l don't know. l get a nosebleed
anywhere above 86th Street.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.605
-God, it's so great to see you.
-Likewise.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.693
Joan, l have a tiny favor to ask you.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.444
They're doing construction
in front of the building

03:15.529 --> 03:17.655
and my driver's gonna be circling,

03:17.739 --> 03:22.243
so if you could have one of the girls
run down at 1 :1 5 and flag him down.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.414
Hello, Ginger.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.426
Olive, from now on, there's no need
to include Mr. Crane in casting.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.345
Of course.
And l brought you tea and coffee.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.431
l'll just have whichever one you don't want.

03:43.515 --> 03:47.727
l... Coffee. That's what l usually drink.
That's what l've been drinking, right?

03:47.811 --> 03:49.896
Well, Lola said
you don't like a second cup of coffee

03:49.980 --> 03:51.898
because it makes you edgy.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.984
l want you to forget everything
Lola told you.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.785
l left for an hour
to go get the nylons for tomorrow,

04:04.870 --> 04:07.538
and look what happened.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.583
Carla said he thought he was on KP duty.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.462
-We don't have to go, you know.
-l said we would.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.381
lt's Roger and Jane.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.177
l want to go. l bought a dress.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.020
"The warmth of the climate
disposed the natives

04:31.104 --> 04:35.399
"to the most intemperate enjoyment
of tranquility and opulence,

04:35.484 --> 04:40.071
"and the lively..."

04:40.155 --> 04:41.697
Licentiousness.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.284
Go ahead.

04:46.828 --> 04:53.125
"...of the Greeks was blended
with the hereditary softness of the Syrians.

04:53.210 --> 04:58.172
"Fashion was the only law,
pleasure was the only pursuit

04:58.715 --> 05:01.300
"and the splendor of dress and furniture

05:01.385 --> 05:04.720
"was the only distinction
of the citizens ofAntioch."

05:05.722 --> 05:08.099
-Gene.
-Hello, Don.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.061
-How's Babylon?
-Bedtime.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.773
lt's all right. Go wash your teeth.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.738
You just wait. All hell's gonna break loose.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.575
Good night, Grandpa Gene.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.510
-Like that.
-Paul Kinsey with a two-stroke lead.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.888
-What is your secret?
-l use Harry Crane's paddle

05:47.973 --> 05:50.182
and l pretend that's his fat head.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.228
What kind of fruit do you put in this?

05:54.312 --> 05:58.441
-lt's rum and Coke. l don't know.
-A cherry? All we have is olives.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.110
New drinks, new copy or both?

06:01.194 --> 06:04.947
Bikinis that match the drinks and new copy.
Something cute.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.369
"lt's Bacardi-licious."

06:11.413 --> 06:13.372
"lt's Bacardi-lightful."

06:13.457 --> 06:17.251
We're supposed to sit here
and pretend like we're on vacation?

06:18.170 --> 06:22.631
-They're probably drinking mint juleps.
-Booze puts me to sleep.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.218
l will take grass any hour of the day.
lt helps me think.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.221
When l was at Princeton,
l wrote my senior thesis

06:29.306 --> 06:30.973
on the passions of the Stoics.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.434
Mary Jane was my muse.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.228
Paul helps me sleep.

06:36.313 --> 06:40.900
Peggy, go get a blender.
Maybe we can turn this into a frappé.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.985
-You get it.
-l'm eating.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.960
Olive?

07:02.214 --> 07:06.300
-What are you doing here?
-Well, if you're working, l'm working.

07:06.384 --> 07:10.638
-lt's okay for you to go home.
-l already canceled my plans.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.640
Phil and l were going to
drive up to The Cloisters.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.102
And Steven, my son,
he's at Boston College.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.895
He was thinking of coming down
with his girlfriend,

07:17.979 --> 07:21.690
but l'm not sure that's working out.
He's picky.

07:23.735 --> 07:28.656
Anyway, so Phil's taking a trip to the dump,
and here l am, no worse for wear.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.124
Don't l seem as important as Cosgrove?

07:38.208 --> 07:41.585
l mean, Campbell makes sense,
to the manner born.

07:41.670 --> 07:45.047
-So you like to get high?
-Whenever l can.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.843
My cousin used to know someone,
but he got married.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.594
Who's your friend?

07:51.763 --> 07:55.141
A guy like you?
There must be somebody you can call.

07:55.642 --> 07:59.061
Yeah. No. Of course.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.316
Sally, get up here.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.033
l just walked backwards
all the way from the living room.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.285
Zip.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.956
You look pretty.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.458
l look like an open umbrella.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.170
Grandpa says you're going to a soirée.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.880
Don't bother him.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.841
Go watch TV.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.766
-Grandpa?
-l'm indisposed.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.216
What are you doing?
You're going to break it.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.927
-Who told you that?
-l've done it.

09:13.011 --> 09:17.264
lf it happens, l'll go get my little
screwdriver and put on a new one.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.977
Jesus, l stink.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.731
l can finish up out here.
You take a nice, long bath.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.446
No. No, no, no.
Ettinger goes at the head of the table.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.074
He's the chief of surgery.
lt's where he always sits.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.369
Not in your home, Greg.
Host at the head, hostess at the foot

09:38.453 --> 09:39.995
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.248
-and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl.
-Who says?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.375
Emily Post. Everyone.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.795
Ronald Ettinger does not read Emily Post.
He's going to expect to sit there,

09:47.879 --> 09:51.090
and he's going to expect me
and Rick Stolich to be his footstools.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.383
Well, l won't have their wives think

09:52.467 --> 09:54.009
you have a wife who doesn't know
how to set a table.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.928
Joanie, l don't want
to have a fight right now.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.680
Then stop talking.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.107
A buffet would be slightly more casual
and people could sit where they will.

10:08.191 --> 10:12.653
And we could put the chafing dish
that they gave us right in the middle.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.488
Perfect.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.285
Hey.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.342
...urged by Republicans
to appoint a special prosecutor

10:35.427 --> 10:38.595
to investigate the scandal-ridden
State Liquor Authority.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.847
The governor has expressed confidence...

10:39.931 --> 10:41.890
Carla.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.225
Carla?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.644
ls she here?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.230
Look at you.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.693
l know l look good for my condition,
but l'm still in my condition.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.738
-Did they leave yet?
-No, l think they're in the living room.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.531
Well, l've been robbed.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.825
l had it right here and now l don't.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.619
Daddy, what are you talking about?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.664
l had $35. Now l have $30.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.000
-Are you sure?
-Mr. Hofstadt,

11:08.084 --> 11:10.919
why don't you go sit down
and we'll all look for it?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.504
You'll look for it, will you?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.965
Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.343
l'm missing $5.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.596
l'll give you $5.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.266
Don, will you give him something?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.188
-Here, Gene. Here you go.
-No, l don't want your money.

11:29.272 --> 11:33.442
You people, you think money
is the answer to every problem.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.153
No, just this particular problem.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.072
Daddy, l'm sorry.
l don't know what you want.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.615
l want my $5!

11:42.786 --> 11:45.746
Well, l think l am finally ready to go.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.797
Come on, let's go out in the yard.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.930
l forgot how many tourists there are
in midtown.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.681
They're like vermin.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.809
Jeffrey, this is my colleague Smitty.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.145
-How you doing, Jeff?
-Not bad. Not bad at all.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.816
-So what do you have for us?
-What do you want?

12:14.317 --> 12:17.111
l've got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.446
Probably get you junk
if you really wanted it.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.741
-How do you know each other?
-Jeffrey's an old friend.

12:22.826 --> 12:26.370
You're looking at the two great cocksmen
of Princeton '55.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.874
The times you must have had.
Can we buy some dope?

12:33.670 --> 12:36.588
l'll give you all four for $1 0, plus delivery.

12:37.507 --> 12:42.010
l'm just kidding, but l should.
l mean, you never call me.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.013
When's the last time l saw you?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.436
-Give me your sweater.
-lt's mohair.

13:01.156 --> 13:04.950
-May l?
-Relax. Sit down.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.873
You ever look out this window?

13:33.438 --> 13:34.980
lt's beautiful.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.490
Nice to see you both. lsn't this something?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.200
Betty, you remember Trudy.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.410
Harry Crane. My wife, Jennifer.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.163
Ken Cosgrove. We've met.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.625
-Nice to see you all again.
-When are you due?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.960
Any minute. Can't you tell?

13:58.463 --> 14:00.047
That last month was the worst,

14:00.131 --> 14:02.966
-but of course this is your second.
-Third.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.179
-How old is yours?
-Eight months. Beatrice Grace.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.184
Should we take a tour?

14:13.478 --> 14:16.605
-l grew up in a club just like this.
-Me, too.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.199
That portly fellow in the glen plaid,
second at DuPont.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.451
The one next to him, Pan Am.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.291
Don't hand out your card.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.514
-Now you're getting ridiculous.
-Maybe it fell out of your pocket.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.684
-lt didn't.
-Well, l didn't take it.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.436
-l didn't say you did.
-Not yet.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.064
Will you stop it, Viola?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.650
My name's not Viola. lt's Carla.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.319
Do you know Viola?

15:05.196 --> 15:07.281
We don't all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.787
Done looking already?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.665
Really?

15:48.031 --> 15:51.783
-Are they still here?
-Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.120
l know what they're doing.
You don't want to go in there.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.040
-What are they doing?
-All l'm saying is,

15:58.124 --> 16:01.918
they obviously don't want to work,
so you should just go home.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.388
l love the commercials where the dog runs
right up to the bowl of food.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.099
How do you make him do that?

16:16.351 --> 16:19.603
-You starve him?
-So you two got a lot of girls?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.814
Shit.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.900
ls that that old lady again?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.570
-Let me in.
-Go away.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.405
lt stinks out here.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.575
Come in quick.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.621
What are you doing?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.750
l know what you're doing. Who are you?

16:41.834 --> 16:45.045
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, '55.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.506
Look, l need it for inspiration.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.510
lt's Saturday, for God's sake.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.679
You can go home. We'll do the work.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.598
Are you kidding?
We'll end up with nothing.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.186
l've got some ideas we can kick around,

17:01.270 --> 17:04.731
but you're gonna have to tell me your name,
sweetheart.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.861
l'm Peggy Olson,
and l want to smoke some marijuana.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.197
You won't like it.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.282
How do you know what l'll like?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.701
You never ask me how l feel about anything

17:15.785 --> 17:17.619
except brassieres and body odor
and makeup.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.711
l'd like to know how you feel
about a lot of things.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.296
-Jesus. Give it a rest.
-Come on.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.810
Just like a strong cigarette.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.107
Can you believe this?

18:00.705 --> 18:04.291
The sun shines bright

18:04.375 --> 18:07.419
On the old Kentucky home

18:07.503 --> 18:08.962
'Tis summer

18:09.046 --> 18:12.799
And the darkies are gay

18:13.718 --> 18:16.803
The corn top's ripe

18:16.888 --> 18:20.474
And the meadow's in the bloom

18:20.558 --> 18:25.562
While the birds make music all the day

18:27.106 --> 18:32.736
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor

18:32.820 --> 18:35.447
All merry, all happy...

18:35.531 --> 18:37.324
Can we go?

18:37.825 --> 18:41.995
What about the horse race?
What about supper?

18:42.705 --> 18:45.415
Don't disappear. l want to dance.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.627
And my old Kentucky home

18:48.711 --> 18:51.546
Good night

18:52.256 --> 18:53.924
l did this at home for her
with a little shoe polish.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.383
She thought it was a scream.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.719
l love it.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.473
Weep no more

19:01.557 --> 19:04.184
my lady

19:05.061 --> 19:10.732
Oh, weep no more today

19:15.947 --> 19:17.989
Can l get an old-fashioned?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.867
We're on the same mission.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.287
This bar looks like it was set up
by a blind man,

19:24.372 --> 19:26.248
and there's no bourbon.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.173
There's a hole at the end here.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.259
l don't have a lot of time.

19:42.807 --> 19:46.685
-Rye okay with you?
-You look like you know what you're doing.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.104
l'm Connie, by the way.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.438
Don.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.026
Service always this good around here?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.530
-You're not a member either?
-No, no.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.159
Nice piece of property, though.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.120
Who are you hiding from?

20:05.788 --> 20:09.958
l am at work disguised as a party.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.211
l'm at work disguised as a wedding.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.591
l hate other people's weddings.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.428
-Why's that?
-Make me nervous,

20:21.512 --> 20:24.764
all those expectations.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.933
And these poor kids in here,

20:28.436 --> 20:31.438
that is a match made in the boardroom.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.401
When l was a boy,

20:36.485 --> 20:40.906
there was a mansion on the river
l used to paddle by in my johnboat.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.913
Twinkling lights, violins,
girls giggling about something.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.423
lt's different inside.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.973
-Where you from?
-San Antonio, New Mexico,

21:07.808 --> 21:12.270
before it was a state. Don't ask me that. Old.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.065
You look fit.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.525
You ever see

21:18.402 --> 21:20.946
A MidsimmerDream with Mickey Rooney?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.989
A Midsummer Night's Dream?

21:23.074 --> 21:25.033
By golly, you're prickly.

21:26.577 --> 21:30.330
l'm Republican, like everyone else in there,

21:30.414 --> 21:34.793
but somehow,
no matter how expensive my cufflinks,

21:35.086 --> 21:37.921
l feel like l've got the head of a jackass.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.970
Where l grew up, there was a roadhouse.

21:45.054 --> 21:49.140
lt boasted live music.
That meant a drum, a bass

21:49.225 --> 21:51.726
and a player piano with nobody at it.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.853
l parked cars.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.648
Fancy people would go there.

21:56.732 --> 22:02.737
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk,
but they wouldn't let me use the toilet.

22:02.822 --> 22:08.576
So when nature called,
l'd open up a trunk and relieve myself.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.707
-You didn't.
-l was 1 5.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.294
There's probably some kid out there
doing it to us right now.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.130
Where you come from?

22:21.632 --> 22:24.384
Pennsylvania by way of lllinois.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.972
We lost our farm, ended up in coal country.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.599
And here you are.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.396
A pleasure to meet you, Don.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.815
Hell of a cocktail.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.839
Rum. Have some.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.133
Some rum?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.428
lf you were feeling it, you'd be hungry.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.639
l am hungry, but it's not worth moving.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.852
She is a riot. Makes me wish l had a job.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.813
Bacardi Eisenhower.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.904
What are you laughing about?

23:26.363 --> 23:30.533
You do have a job, Jeffrey.
You're a drug pusher.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.164
What is that, an English accent?

23:36.791 --> 23:39.626
lt's a little different than freshman year.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.670
Kinsey was a real Jersey.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.883
l guess that's why they have scholarships.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.722
Get out.

23:57.520 --> 24:02.690
You're arrogant. And you know what else?
You can't sing.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.485
Take it back.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.780
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here not to fight.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.657
Take it back, Graves.

24:11.408 --> 24:16.579
Fine. l guess they kicked you out
of the Tigertones because you were too tall.

24:17.665 --> 24:18.915
Graves...

24:20.000 --> 24:21.668
We're done here.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.547
And by the way,
l left the 'Tones because l had mono.

24:27.007 --> 24:31.761
Fine. Why don't you sing a little
and let them be the judge?

25:25.107 --> 25:26.900
l am so high.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.868
l wish you were waiting for me.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.335
So who are you waiting for?

25:46.253 --> 25:47.837
A friend.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.594
What is that like?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.140
l don't know.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.434
l don't think about it.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.438
Right now, it's uncomfortable, mostly.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.399
But it moves around in there.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.985
lt does.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.786
l'm going to blame this on martinis, but...
May l?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.518
She's not moving now.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.773
Who are you waiting for?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.108
My date.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.279
You can't show up to these things stag,

26:54.363 --> 26:56.489
but then you run into people.

27:04.206 --> 27:07.625
l apologize. There was a line for the mirror
and l feel like l'm melting.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.877
No trouble at all.

27:11.797 --> 27:16.092
l hope they start playing some real music.
l'm in the mood to dance, aren't you?

27:18.804 --> 27:19.971
Martinis.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.932
Please, don't stand on ceremony. Dig in.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.565
l'll cut the cheese.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.069
What are you laughing about?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.988
Everything is some private joke with them.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.157
What were you giggling
about the other day?

27:39.241 --> 27:42.035
-A code pink.
-What's that?

27:42.119 --> 27:43.870
They put a call over the PA

27:43.954 --> 27:47.915
whenever there's an
attractive unconscious female.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.251
l've never heard of that.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.503
-Me either.
-Sounds like where l work.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.592
-l'm gonna check the roast.
-You need a hand?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.927
-l don't think so.
-Nonsense.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.638
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.766
Thanks.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.437
You really have a lovely place.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.608
l'm glad you like it. l did most of it myself.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.777
You must do well.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.905
lt's not easy. Not that l'm complaining.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.698
You think they make no money now?

28:20.783 --> 28:23.785
You should've seen back when
Ronald and l were first married.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.455
l taught kindergarten
and made three times what Ron did.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.707
We lived in a pit.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.543
But one day
you'll look back on this time and smile.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.170
Just don't get pregnant.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.797
Excuse me?

28:36.799 --> 28:39.550
The last thing you want right now is a child.

28:39.635 --> 28:43.596
l told her the same thing,
but she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.640
You do what you want.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.143
lf Greg becomes chief resident,
then things will get easier.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.355
The fact that Greg can
get a woman like you

28:52.439 --> 28:56.150
makes me feel good about his future,
no matter what happens.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.494
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!

29:11.834 --> 29:13.835
You have to eat something.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.754
You don't tell me what to do.

29:16.839 --> 29:20.842
You either eat or you don't eat,
but there'll be no more of that.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.889
l told you l'm not hungry.

29:26.974 --> 29:30.726
-l want my money.
-You don't even know that you lost it.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.188
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!

30:02.009 --> 30:03.718
Grandpa, is this it?

30:05.220 --> 30:07.346
Grandpa, is this your money?

30:08.390 --> 30:11.350
l don't know. Let me see it.

30:45.427 --> 30:48.304
Yeah, that's it, all right.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.271
Well, that's a relief.
Sally, your food's getting cold.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.792
Excuse me.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.922
Why, thank you.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.844
He's pretending like
we didn't have a fight on the way over.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.721
He seems amenable right now.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.056
l warned him that with this set

31:32.140 --> 31:34.517
there was a good chance
one of my old beaus might appear.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.436
-And yet they didn't.
-Which is a relief.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.859
l don't want to. All l have to talk about
is work, which is verboten.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.529
Well, that's nonsense.
You're very charming.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.739
Come on. l'll talk.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.659
They want to know
we're having a good time.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.838
Well, we're really having a good time.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.593
Haven't seen you two on the dance floor.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.679
l don't move that well right now.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.223
Don loves to dance,

32:14.308 --> 32:18.144
but l think l'm disappointing him
because l don't feel like it.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.439
Your asses are going to
wear out those chairs.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.690
Roger.

32:23.692 --> 32:27.653
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...

32:27.738 --> 32:28.821
Sherry Ardmore.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.407
Henry works in the governor's office.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.868
Don Draper. This is my wife, Betty.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.080
Hank, tell them where
you were this afternoon.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.124
-Roger...
-They're gonna read about it in the paper.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.586
He just came from Pocantico.
Rockefeller married Happy.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.131
She just got divorced a month ago.
She has four children.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.300
You see? That's the first reaction.

32:49.384 --> 32:53.095
Divorce is political hari-kari.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.972
Now we'll be stuck with Goldwater.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.433
The primaries are still a long way off.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.895
-Why did Rocky marry her?
-They're in love.

33:07.861 --> 33:08.903
We're going to dance.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.989
Betty, Don,
are you sure you're not up for it?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.239
l have got to bring a date next time.

34:51.423 --> 34:55.342
"This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends

34:55.427 --> 34:59.555
"This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper"

35:00.932 --> 35:06.061
We got it. You're educated
and you sang in the Tiger...

35:06.146 --> 35:08.689
-What are they called?
-Tigertones.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.154
l went to the University of Michigan.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.949
l went to Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.202
Can you believe her?

35:21.286 --> 35:24.455
l keep thinking about rum,
and l keep thinking about Cuba,

35:24.539 --> 35:27.374
and l keep thinking about
how we're all going to die.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.378
-We almost died.
-But we didn't.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.256
How about something about life?

35:36.009 --> 35:37.676
Let's go on the roof.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.221
And do what?

35:40.847 --> 35:45.142
Think about Daiquiri Beach.
We need five more situations for rum.

35:46.478 --> 35:52.483
On the roof is a good idea, actually.
A hammock right between the clotheslines.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.694
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.822
Are you working?

35:59.491 --> 36:00.866
l think so.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.209
You both can leave.

36:13.046 --> 36:15.631
l'm in a very good place right now.

36:35.819 --> 36:39.113
You left your purse in your office,
unattended.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.908
-Someone could have stolen it.
-No one's here.

36:44.703 --> 36:48.122
You think l don't know
what you've been doing in there?

36:49.165 --> 36:52.543
-l don't know what to say.
-l've got nothing to hide.

36:52.627 --> 36:58.257
Well, you're free to do whatever you want,
but you're not thinking about your future.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.594
The thing is,

37:02.679 --> 37:04.138
l have a job.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.684
l have my own office
with my name on the door,

37:09.144 --> 37:12.646
and l have a secretary. That's you.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.736
And l am not scared of any of this.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.327
But you're scared.

37:27.954 --> 37:31.707
Oh, my God. You're scared.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.880
Don't worry about me.

37:39.132 --> 37:43.844
l am going to get to do everything
you want for me.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.097
l'm going to be fine, Olive.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.727
l really am.

37:57.525 --> 38:01.904
Your expense report is ready
for your review. lt's on your desk.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.625
l need you to get the Dictaphone set up,

38:14.709 --> 38:17.836
and l need a glass of water,
and then you can go.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.883
That's very pretty.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.053
Thank you.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.772
-When are you due?
-Early September.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.691
You and the First Lady.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.151
Well, l think she looks a lot better.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.486
You could dress like that.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.655
Go to Lord & Taylor
and ask for my friend Bunny Appelle.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.575
-She'll take care of you.
-You really know everything, Joan.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.789
Honey, would you talk to your husband?

38:53.873 --> 38:56.250
l don't know what l'm going to do next year.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.420
He is going to be a tough act to follow.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.631
Those people in Texas
will be crawling all over you.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.801
lf l ever need a pneumonectomy,
that's the man.

39:05.885 --> 39:09.596
You heard me say it. Great hands.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.852
Look, Greg, it's a complicated operation.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.937
Christ, that's not what l meant.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.231
-lt happens.
-What happened?

39:21.109 --> 39:23.902
l don't like to worry Joanie
about those kinds of things.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.781
Come on. Everyone gets
a bad result every once in a while.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.246
You know what? Enough shop talk.
This is not civilian conversation.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.500
Do you want to play charades?

39:38.585 --> 39:41.253
-Come on. You're terrible.
-No, l'm not.

39:42.422 --> 39:47.509
Well, Joanie has many, many talents.
You should play for them.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.928
-No.
-Come on. l'll go get it.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.060
-You're all gonna love this.
-What do you play?

39:56.144 --> 39:58.020
l am out of practice.

39:58.104 --> 40:01.273
-Come on, Joanie.
-Wonderful!

40:01.357 --> 40:04.902
Come on, just sing a little something.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.324
lt'll be just like the olden days.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.409
We used to sit in the parlor after supper.

40:12.494 --> 40:15.454
My mother would play the piano
while we read.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.648
Just let me have another bite
and then we can go.

41:31.406 --> 41:35.534
l guess we're the last ones to eat.
That's what my mother always said.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.536
Family holds back.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.001
You shouldn't be filling your plate.
You're the hostess.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.837
-l'll get you some food.
-Come on. Come on.

41:46.921 --> 41:50.007
-You should sit down.
-Okay.

41:50.091 --> 41:53.886
Oh, my God! You're pregnant.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.013
-You're so beautiful.
-Thank you.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.265
Don't you just love looking at her?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.267
Aren't they a beautiful couple?

42:01.936 --> 42:04.563
l knew you two would get back together.

42:05.648 --> 42:09.026
l never had any doubt,
no matter what the problem was.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.863
l'll take care of her.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.746
You don't like me.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.082
l'm a nice person.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.544
What's going on here?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.176
l should've eaten something.

42:37.972 --> 42:41.391
Will someone please get her
a glass of milk?

42:41.476 --> 42:44.144
Don, can l talk to you for a second?

42:49.484 --> 42:51.360
What the hell was that?

42:51.444 --> 42:53.111
Your wife's drunk.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.661
l don't know what l did
to get under your skin.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.371
Roger, it's late.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.251
You know, my mother was right.

43:07.335 --> 43:12.673
lt's a mistake to be conspicuously happy.
Some people don't like it.

43:13.049 --> 43:16.969
No one thinks you're happy.
They think you're foolish.

43:22.141 --> 43:25.519
You know, that's the great thing
about a place like this,

43:25.979 --> 43:30.190
you can come here and be happy,
and you get to choose your guests.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.422
Good night, Grandpa.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.091
Get in here.

44:03.599 --> 44:04.891
Sit down.

44:25.038 --> 44:26.538
Where were we?

44:41.429 --> 44:46.558
"The rustic manners of a prince
who disdained such glory

44:46.642 --> 44:50.520
"and was insensible of such happiness

44:50.605 --> 44:54.191
"soon disgusted the delicacy
of his subjects,

44:55.318 --> 45:00.530
"and the effeminate Orientals
could neither imitate nor admire

45:00.615 --> 45:04.618
"the severe simplicity
which Julian always maintained

45:04.702 --> 45:06.703
"and sometimes affected."
