POHjOLA-FILMI AND
CINENORD KIDSTORY PRESENT

00:20.479 --> 00:23.357
Miisu Siltanen.
Congratulations.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.319
A FILM BY MARI RANTASILA

00:28.696 --> 00:30.448
Mai Hukkinen.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.411
Congratulations.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.832
Are you getting pictures?

00:41.834 --> 00:46.130
Thank you for this preschool year,
and good luck for school.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.718
Let's sing a farewell song
to mark the end of preschool.

00:50.885 --> 00:58.100
<i>The ship is ready to sail,
it's off to a place very far</i>

00:58.267 --> 01:01.979
BASED ON A SERIES OF BOOKS
BY VEERA SALMI

01:05.399 --> 01:07.818
<i>I'm not really Mai.</i>

01:09.779 --> 01:11.989
<i>I'm Pony.</i>

01:15.951 --> 01:17.953
Take it off.

01:21.665 --> 01:25.461
PONY AND BIRDBOY

01:27.254 --> 01:32.927
<i>Ponies are free. They get to gallop
alone outside all summer long.</i>

01:38.641 --> 01:43.562
<i>They jump over hurdles and neigh
so that the whole yard shakes.</i>

01:43.687 --> 01:45.689
Neigh!

01:49.151 --> 01:52.279
<i>Ponies like people, but...</i>

01:53.614 --> 01:56.700
<i>...not all people like ponies.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:04.458
<i>Like Teppo, for instance.</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:09.255
<i>He's our neighbour and the headmaster
in the school I'm going to.</i>

02:12.299 --> 02:15.010
<i>He probably doesn't like anything.</i>

02:20.683 --> 02:23.310
<i>We've always lived here.</i>

02:24.353 --> 02:26.021
Hi!

02:26.230 --> 02:28.149
<i>My mum.</i>

02:30.192 --> 02:31.735
<i>My dad.</i>

02:33.237 --> 02:35.197
<i>And me.</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:43.330
<i>The summer went by awfully fast,
and the school starts soon.</i>

02:45.332 --> 02:47.710
What's this?
- A dumpster.

02:47.877 --> 02:50.963
Exactly. And you're not allowed
to play with rubbish.

02:51.172 --> 02:54.008
It's high time
you started learning the rules.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.011
You see, there are
plenty of rules at school.

03:02.558 --> 03:06.645
And don't think you can come
to my school wearing that thing!

03:08.689 --> 03:12.693
<i>Adults say
"When you become a schoolgirl,</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:15.446
<i>everything will change."</i>

03:15.613 --> 03:19.575
<i>For some reason,
it doesn't sound good at all.</i>

03:20.367 --> 03:22.786
How long does the school last?

03:22.953 --> 03:25.998
Only a couple of hours a day
in first grade.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.584
I mean the whole school.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.755
The primary school is six years.
- Then middle school, three years.

03:32.922 --> 03:36.842
Then secondary school, three years.
- That's way too much!

03:37.009 --> 03:40.304
And the fun starts
when you go to the university.

03:40.471 --> 03:44.391
No way! I'll be a granny
when I get out of school.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.228
I totally agree.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.944
Sorry. I'm just being honest.

03:55.110 --> 03:59.365
Teenagers have a permanent
short circuit in their brain.

04:01.659 --> 04:06.163
Luckily you're a smart first-grader.
- Everything will be fine.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.333
What would you like?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.925
<i>I ain't lying.
It's only one ninety-nine.</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:22.137
Look at that dude. He's got
an amazing talent for finding buns.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.932
And look at his sense of rhythm!

04:34.817 --> 04:36.652
Look!

04:53.711 --> 04:56.171
Hey, look who's over there.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.179
Hi!
- Hello!

05:04.888 --> 05:08.642
We came from the summer house
to buy some stuff for school.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.061
Nice backpack!
- Thanks.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.148
Are you nervous?
Only two weeks to go.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.442
I don't think so...

05:16.608 --> 05:20.612
Miska and I have already
practised walking to school.

05:21.322 --> 05:25.951
Oh, you're a wonderful big brother.
Every first-grader should have one.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.667
Here we go!
Come and buy some pens.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.421
<i>I've got ballpoint pens and pencils.</i>

05:37.588 --> 05:41.050
<i>And let's throw in
some sharpeners as well.</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:45.637
Pencil cases come with pictures
of monsters and other creatures.

05:45.804 --> 05:50.601
And it all goes for... I ain't lying.
One ninety-nine and then some!

05:51.226 --> 05:53.354
School starts!

05:53.520 --> 05:57.066
A pencil case party!
Discount for first-graders.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.194
Sale! Super sale! One ninety-nine!

06:00.402 --> 06:04.073
The holiday is over.
Have a safe trip to school!

06:04.239 --> 06:07.951
Sale! Super sale!
One ninety-nine. School starts!

06:09.161 --> 06:12.873
All right. Should we buy you
a backpack too?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.878
How about the one with a horse?
- No.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.844
Oh, I think this is for Pony.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.100
Should we tone down the horse stuff
before the school starts?

06:31.266 --> 06:33.644
Well, I don't know.

06:33.811 --> 06:37.481
Is it normal to have
such a vivid imagination?

06:37.648 --> 06:39.983
She's just playing.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.028
This came in the post.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.539
SCHOOL STARTS SOON

07:17.855 --> 07:20.315
JULY

07:24.528 --> 07:26.363
AUGUST

08:15.787 --> 08:18.499
One ninety-nine!

08:29.510 --> 08:32.054
Whoopee! Whoopee!

08:32.221 --> 08:36.350
Now is the time to buy a horsehair
brush and a packet of pens.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.937
For an unbelievable price
of one ninety-nine!

08:40.562 --> 08:42.856
Buy now, pay in November!

08:44.608 --> 08:47.611
Hello!
Howdy-do, nice to meet you.

08:47.778 --> 08:52.032
I'm Birdboy, the hottest
advertising dude in Hakaniemi.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.410
I'm Pony.
- Oh, Pony!

09:06.672 --> 09:11.301
Listen, Pony buddy! Do you happen to
know any vacant attics in the hood?

09:11.885 --> 09:17.057
Or basements, or huts,
or balconies, or other shacks?

09:18.350 --> 09:22.312
Well, would you happen to need
an advertising advertiser?

09:22.479 --> 09:26.692
Birdboy will advertise anything
for one ninety-nine-nine.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.904
Well. What about buns?

09:31.822 --> 09:34.783
Do you happen to have one

09:34.950 --> 09:38.203
teeny-weeny bunny-bun for me?

09:39.871 --> 09:42.874
I've got an amazing talent
for finding buns.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.028
Ouch!

10:12.738 --> 10:15.282
You shouldn't be in there!

10:24.750 --> 10:27.252
This just arrived on the market:

10:27.419 --> 10:31.465
an incredibly effective
home-building project package

10:31.673 --> 10:35.552
called Homenator.
The price is one ninety-nine-nine.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.680
It's junk. It's going to the dump.

10:38.847 --> 10:43.435
It's not junk. Look.
By golly, what a Salebaloo.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.064
And what about this then?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.901
A portable... box?

10:51.068 --> 10:54.946
No, it's a Yummygator.
It's got all the apps and stuff.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.199
Let's download Instagram.

10:58.784 --> 11:02.454
And hashtag and Snapchat.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.875
Hashtag what?
- ♪myshack.com.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.295
This is it, tsah-bam!

11:10.462 --> 11:13.173
Birdboy, you're totally crazy.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.176
And over the top.
Guess what you are?

11:16.301 --> 11:18.762
My horse buddy!

11:18.929 --> 11:21.598
Neigh!
- Birdboy and Pony!

11:21.807 --> 11:26.061
We're going to make
an incredibly adorable buddy team!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.944
Neigh!

12:03.473 --> 12:05.475
<i>Quiet!</i>

12:22.284 --> 12:25.078
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.351
I found some amazing stuff.

12:48.518 --> 12:52.647
An antenna for the Yummygator.
Now I can call with it.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.903
Blah blah blah.
Yes, of course.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.995
It works!

13:07.162 --> 13:09.331
Look! Cool.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.795
But you can't live here.
- Yes, I can.

13:14.961 --> 13:20.050
I'll just do my advertising here
and listen to the rain. Plip-plop.

13:20.217 --> 13:24.471
Hey, I'm really good at
building huts. I can help you!

13:26.181 --> 13:29.935
Whoopee! That's amazingly mega-great!
Let's make a deal.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.938
I help you, and you help me. Huh?

13:34.022 --> 13:39.319
You might not be able to help me.
- I'm absolutely sure I can.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.657
I'm a Mega-professor at
the University of Helping Sciences,

13:43.865 --> 13:48.119
and I have very scientific
Master's degree. Didn't I tell you?

13:49.538 --> 13:52.707
I should start school next autumn.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.628
But I don't want to.
Schoolchildren don't play anymore.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.968
Wait a minute.
There has been a misunderstanding!

14:04.010 --> 14:06.263
What?
- You at school?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.932
Find five mistakes in the picture.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.686
One: muzzle, two: bridle,
three: ponytail.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.981
Four: say "neigh".
- Neigh!

14:16.147 --> 14:19.943
And five:
the aromatic aroma of a horse.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.655
So, horses don't go to school!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.783
That's right!
- Exactly!

14:27.701 --> 14:30.203
I won't go to school.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.123
Everyone goes to school.
- Why?

14:33.999 --> 14:38.378
It's the law. The president says so.
- Stupid president!

14:38.503 --> 14:42.757
You can become a president
and write your own laws.

14:42.966 --> 14:47.095
After you've gone to school.
- Ponies don't go to school.

14:47.262 --> 14:52.183
I'll go to the stables, become a
police horse, and put you in prison!

14:52.893 --> 14:54.895
Rig ht.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.870
When a horse feels
threatened, it flees.

15:54.996 --> 15:59.250
It's an instinct. It flees first
and then looks back to see

15:59.417 --> 16:01.962
if it was in danger or not.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.965
There is no danger.

16:06.466 --> 16:11.096
You have to approach a horse
diagonally from the front

16:12.347 --> 16:16.518
because they can't see
right in front of them.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.521
Yeah, yeah.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.733
Good girl, good girl.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.195
Good Pony, good.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.787
Good Pony.

16:44.379 --> 16:48.633
They don't let me be Pony.
- Home is the wrong place.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.138
Maybe one in a billion
can turn into a horse at home.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.640
You need to go somewhere else.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.268
Like where?
- To a barn.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.521
Or where do horses live?
In a hall, in a stable.

17:01.646 --> 17:05.150
You need to start hanging out
in a horse gang.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.444
Okay!
<i>'</i> Okay!

17:37.766 --> 17:41.978
So, because you look
more or less like a normal girl,

17:42.187 --> 17:45.148
you have to transform
totally into a horse.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.317
Okay!

17:47.776 --> 17:50.737
Why are they captive?
- So they don't run away.

17:50.904 --> 17:55.450
Are they criminals? Vests and
everything. Are they in a gang?

17:56.284 --> 18:01.206
You know nothing about ponies.
They're always outside like that.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.792
They're not bad guys.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.962
Look, a turd!
- How will I grow hooves?

18:09.297 --> 18:13.384
Get closer. Wanna see how
Mr. Great Horse Interviewer does it?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.929
Aka Birdboy?
- Okay!

18:16.137 --> 18:19.933
This is Current Affairs and
Birdy Birdboy, good evening.

18:20.141 --> 18:24.646
Gang horses are being held captive.
That's hashtag dot boom.

18:24.813 --> 18:29.859
Now I'm going to interview
one of these dangerous gang members.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.612
Good day, are you willing to speak?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.323
He doesn't want to!

18:37.242 --> 18:40.161
My friend would like to join
your gang.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.832
She can neigh really well.
Pony, neigh a little.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.170
Get in there! Join the horse gang!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.807
Incredible!

19:01.808 --> 19:04.310
Go on, Pony! Neigh!

19:08.898 --> 19:12.527
No-one goes to school
in these circles!

19:26.291 --> 19:28.877
Do I look like a real horse at all?

19:29.961 --> 19:33.464
Well, maybe a little in that spot.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.344
Really?
- Well, not really.

19:38.511 --> 19:43.600
But does it matter if it's
real or pretend, or pretend or real?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.820
Maybe I should eat
what they're eating.

19:55.987 --> 19:59.240
That's like really genius, you know.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.243
Go on, then!

20:06.247 --> 20:10.210
Incredible, Pony!
I mean it, that's amazing!

20:10.376 --> 20:12.712
Go, Pony! Woohoo!

20:16.549 --> 20:19.093
Pony! Pony!

20:20.220 --> 20:22.263
What?

20:28.353 --> 20:30.647
Did you trick me?

20:33.858 --> 20:36.569
Humans can't turn into horses, right?

20:36.736 --> 20:40.823
Did you know, the University
of Mushroom Sciences...

20:40.990 --> 20:43.034
Birdboy!

20:51.251 --> 20:54.504
I'm not sure
I can find my way back home.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.775
Pony!

21:18.653 --> 21:20.655
Pony!

21:31.874 --> 21:36.337
What do you mean “might be missing"?
She's either missing or not!

21:37.422 --> 21:40.133
Oh my god, it's evening already.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.552
I'm coming. Bye.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.681
No-one has seen anything.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.809
It's the police!

21:52.312 --> 21:55.440
<i>Hello,</i> Matti <i>Hukkinen.</i>
- <i>Good evening.</i>

21:55.606 --> 21:58.443
<i>Do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course.</i>

21:58.609 --> 22:01.446
<i>I've got exactly what you need.
- Yes'?</i>

22:01.612 --> 22:05.658
<i>I can solve your problemos.
You know what causes most fights?</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:08.703
<i>No, 1 don't...
- An old vacuum cleaner.</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:12.248
Who is it?
- A vacuum cleaner salesman.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.544
<i>The suction power is amazing...
- I'm sorry but we have...</i>

22:16.711 --> 22:19.672
<i>Our</i> child is...
<i>- You have a child! How young?</i>

22:19.839 --> 22:23.343
She's seven.
- Hang up now.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.137
Yes, school starts soon. Okay.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.474
Hey, sorry.
Send me a vacuum cleaner then.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.894
<i>One PowerSnout is on its way.
Thanks. Bye.</i>

22:35.855 --> 22:38.941
What?
Our vacuum cleaner was pretty old.

22:39.609 --> 22:43.446
Besides, this one was called
PowerSnout 2000+.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.366
I'm starving!

22:46.908 --> 22:48.868
Pony!

22:49.577 --> 22:51.871
Pony! Sweetheart.

23:04.509 --> 23:07.387
Did you forget to look at the time?

23:07.553 --> 23:12.850
No. I decided to become a real pony
so that I don't have to go to school.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.436
A pretty smart plan.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.314
A stupid plan. It didn't work.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.584
<i>Pony, Pony, Pony!</i>

23:42.463 --> 23:44.715
<i>Oh no! No!</i>

23:48.469 --> 23:50.721
Help me, Pony!

24:06.279 --> 24:08.197
Ouch!

24:10.283 --> 24:12.368
Oh, good morning.

24:12.577 --> 24:16.205
Sorry, I didn't think
anyone would be in there.

24:16.372 --> 24:20.001
Well, someone has to organise it.

24:20.710 --> 24:25.006
A dumpster like this
attracts flies like a muck-heap.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.315
Good morning.
- Good morning.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.984
Any plans for today?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.867
My new snout buddy
might arrive today.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.796
Should we...

25:05.963 --> 25:09.008
...go and see a doctor?

25:09.717 --> 25:11.636
Why?

25:11.802 --> 25:15.848
They could check
if it's normal to run away like that.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.017
A doctor?

25:19.435 --> 25:21.896
Just to talk.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.904
So, what's the problem?
Stress, breakdown,

25:30.029 --> 25:32.782
diarrhoea, or speech disorder?

25:33.407 --> 25:37.954
Why do all kids have to go to school
even if they don't want to?

25:38.746 --> 25:41.207
Hey, don't go to school. Be an adult.

25:41.374 --> 25:44.835
They don't have to go to school.
- What do you mean?

25:45.002 --> 25:47.797
Well, I'll write you a prescription.

25:47.964 --> 25:52.134
It'll help you move faster
in your career.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.392
And then some Abracadabra,

25:59.600 --> 26:03.062
Zooba Dooba, Bim Bom!

26:04.689 --> 26:07.149
And now we make a wish.

26:08.276 --> 26:13.072
I wish I'd grow up right now!

26:39.974 --> 26:43.519
Hi, this is Pony.
I'm selling vacuum cleaners.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.439
It's called SnoutBuddy 2000+.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.111
Umm, I think it's 4,000.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.532
Yes, I think
it's quite expensive too.

26:58.159 --> 27:01.162
You can have it for a tenner.
Come and get it.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.956
Yes, thanks!

27:10.379 --> 27:14.842
Hi, this is Pony. Do you want to buy
a SnoutBuddy for a tenner?

27:16.469 --> 27:19.430
The suction power
is maximum and over the top.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.391
The snout is like a giraffe's neck.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.564
Its backside says "prrt prrt".

27:29.357 --> 27:33.110
Buy now, pay in November.
- Buy now, pay in November.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.199
You'll get a free party hat.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.785
Yes, thanks!

27:48.459 --> 27:51.295
No party hat?
- Whoopee!

27:51.462 --> 27:55.257
Put your head in a toilet.
We'll never call you again. Bye!

27:55.424 --> 27:57.218
That's right!

28:00.721 --> 28:03.099
You'll take it? Yahoo!

28:03.599 --> 28:07.436
<i>Merci, gracias, thank you!</i>
- Thank you, room service.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.528
A Jack Russel and a golden retriever.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.198
A very aromatic fart.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.288
You'll get a free Mercedes Benz.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.554
Yahoo!
- Thank you.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.519
Hi!
- Hello.

28:52.523 --> 28:56.193
Listen, I've been meaning to talk
to you about Pony.

28:56.318 --> 29:00.156
Yes, I can see her and hear her.
It's not a good sign.

29:00.281 --> 29:03.868
Yeah, she's so creative.
- Creativity, creativity!

29:04.034 --> 29:06.787
Everything is about creativity
these days!

29:06.954 --> 29:11.250
It's what stops kids from learning.
- What are you talking about?

29:11.375 --> 29:13.586
Your daughter!

29:14.295 --> 29:18.883
You can't teach anything sensible
to kids like that. Math, for example.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.885
Pony!

29:21.051 --> 29:22.928
Whoopee!

29:23.387 --> 29:25.890
Oh no.
- We're at work!

29:26.056 --> 29:30.686
Where?
- Selling vacuum cleaners. People have bought tons!

29:30.895 --> 29:35.566
I'm an insanely good adult worker.
I don't have to go to school!

29:35.775 --> 29:38.235
You're not an adult, you're a child.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.947
Children don't work.
They go to school. Period.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.867
Look at yourself.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.370
Should you go wash your face?

29:52.249 --> 29:56.837
We've got to do something.
- Honey, there's no reason to worry.

29:57.296 --> 30:01.175
What about therapy?
- I'll come up with something.

30:11.435 --> 30:16.440
When you learn to read properly,
a whole new world will open up.

30:16.607 --> 30:21.320
Because books have
all the wisdom in the world.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.699
Look at this, for example.
It's quite good.

30:27.076 --> 30:31.163
And this one!
I haven't read this in a long time.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.500
Read, sweetie.

30:38.254 --> 30:42.258
And after you read all those books,
you'll be wise

30:42.383 --> 30:46.470
because "books have
all the wisdom in the world".

30:46.637 --> 30:49.640
Yeah, and I don't have to
go to school. Yes!

30:49.849 --> 30:52.017
Genius, genius!

30:58.774 --> 31:02.736
"And the sheep's liv-er

31:02.945 --> 31:09.410
did not give us a-ny
in-for-ma-tion to speak of."

31:12.079 --> 31:16.375
"It was just black

31:16.542 --> 31:20.379
and had an un-pleas-ant smell."

31:21.088 --> 31:24.800
A speaking, smelly liver. Yuck!

31:25.801 --> 31:28.429
A bad book. Throw it away.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.432
The black liver landed with a splat.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.978
Crime and Pun-ish-ment.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.899
This must be thrilling.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.693
They reveal
the whole story in the cover!

31:42.902 --> 31:45.946
First there's a crime,
then the punishment.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.532
Really exciting. Throw it away.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.659
Splat.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.120
Blah blah.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.958
Finished it!
- Finished it!

31:58.918 --> 32:00.961
Finished it!

32:06.008 --> 32:08.218
Guess what! Finished it!

32:14.850 --> 32:18.479
I don't think I remember any of it.
- That's okay.

32:18.646 --> 32:22.316
I know stuff. Ask me anything.
- Why are there so many roads

32:22.441 --> 32:24.944
but so few water slides?

32:25.819 --> 32:29.114
That's a burning hot question, ouch.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.743
What if it was the other way around?
- It'd be a lot better.

32:32.952 --> 32:37.831
Order it, then, Honourable President
Who Has Read All Books.

32:38.040 --> 32:42.461
President? All I remember about
those books is the black liver.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.756
Well, that's enough
for the President.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.973
<i>All children must have
access to a water slide.</i>

32:54.139 --> 32:57.893
Regardless of where they live
or other stuff.

32:58.102 --> 33:04.149
A water slide shall be built in every
village, city, and yard immediately.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.365
Ten water slides.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.169
In addition, I declare
extra days off for the teeth.

33:24.336 --> 33:28.132
On those days, no-one
has to brush their teeth at all!

33:31.260 --> 33:34.138
Three hundred days off a year.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.403
BIRD-TV

33:49.528 --> 33:54.491
Those were this year's reforms.
Or did you have something to add?

33:56.410 --> 33:58.954
Have a nice evening.

33:59.163 --> 34:02.708
<i>President Pony! President Pony!</i>

34:14.094 --> 34:16.096
<i>Pony..-.</i>

34:16.722 --> 34:18.556
<i>Pony!!!</i>

34:19.058 --> 34:21.476
What have you done?

34:21.601 --> 34:23.603
No, no!

34:25.063 --> 34:28.317
<i>My Egyptian!
No, no, no'.!</i>

34:28.484 --> 34:30.735
Everything's okay.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.451
<i>My Crime...</i>

34:38.577 --> 34:40.871
<i>...and Punishment.</i>

34:44.416 --> 34:46.877
Mai Magdaleena Hukkinen!

34:53.884 --> 34:57.179
Do we have to go?
- It'll do you good.

34:57.346 --> 35:01.308
It takes a professional
to tame a wild foal like you.

35:03.227 --> 35:07.356
Hello. You are all warmly welcome.

35:08.148 --> 35:11.902
I am a hereness therapist,
Priscilla Pain.

35:12.111 --> 35:16.156
But you can call me
a hereness therapist.

35:18.450 --> 35:23.247
I'm sure many of you wonder
what "hereness" means.

35:23.705 --> 35:28.752
Let's see. Most people
feel like asking themselves

35:28.919 --> 35:31.922
"Where am I? Where am I?"

35:32.965 --> 35:37.261
With this method I invented,
they learn to answer very clearly

35:37.803 --> 35:40.013
"Here I am."

35:41.140 --> 35:43.142
Let's see.

35:47.437 --> 35:50.274
This is what
your mind looks like, right?

35:50.732 --> 35:55.320
A chaos of colours, events,
fragments of thoughts,

35:55.487 --> 35:59.825
crazy ideas, whims. On top of
each other, overlapping one another.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.217
But what if your mind
looked like this?

36:18.093 --> 36:21.221
An awful lot clearer, right?

36:22.931 --> 36:25.684
Let's all close our eyes.

36:34.568 --> 36:38.322
There's no need to worry
if it feels difficult.

36:38.488 --> 36:42.034
With my instructions,
you'll find perfect peace.

36:56.423 --> 37:00.219
Let's all take a deep breath

37:00.928 --> 37:03.889
and say "Here I am".

37:04.556 --> 37:07.392
Here I am.
- Here I am.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.728
Here I am.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.609
Here I am.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.449
Hi.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.744
What are you doing?
- Concentrating.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.664
This is hereness therapy.

37:28.789 --> 37:32.584
I have to stare at the tree
and say "Here I am".

37:32.751 --> 37:36.255
I see.
Does it help you to concentrate?

37:36.421 --> 37:40.300
Yes. This helps me
to do well in school. Here I am.

37:41.843 --> 37:45.097
Okay. But come
and have dinner, won't you.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.310
Here I am!

37:50.477 --> 37:53.563
Stop it already.
- Here I am!

37:53.730 --> 37:55.983
She was supposed to learn
how to focus!

37:56.149 --> 37:59.528
I am a schoolgirl. I'm concentrating.

38:00.153 --> 38:04.116
Here I am!
- That's enough!

38:07.035 --> 38:09.288
I'll take the lead now.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.375
Why is this so hard?
School's a good thing!

38:16.336 --> 38:19.881
Ta-dah!
These are my old school photos.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.468
And reports.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.096
Almost straight A's.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.391
And tests. History: A.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.812
Math: A-.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.734
I was a bit nervous about tests.
Especially random tests.

38:38.859 --> 38:41.486
What are they?
- Random tests?

38:41.653 --> 38:47.326
You never know when you have them
and what they are like.

38:47.492 --> 38:51.371
It's super exciting! Every time
I wake up in the morning...

39:00.464 --> 39:02.758
RANDOM TEST

39:09.681 --> 39:14.353
You make new friends at school.
My best friend was called Seppo.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.522
But he's dead now.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.877
What is it?
- Nothing.

39:40.504 --> 39:43.548
New things can make you nervous.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.259
But you can always practise.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.181
Come on, chop-chop! Move it!

39:51.390 --> 39:55.143
First we practise walking to school.
Traffic can be dangerous.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.772
Twenty seconds, doing good.
Keep moving!

39:58.897 --> 40:01.149
Go, Pony! Chop-chop!

40:04.569 --> 40:06.905
Hurry!
Good, good!

40:07.406 --> 40:10.283
Ponytail ready? Good! Let's go.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.413
These stay here.
It's a school, not a horse pasture.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.457
Okay. Let's go!

40:42.190 --> 40:45.902
This street is tricky.
Be careful or you'll get squashed.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.738
Left, right, left.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.658
Left, right, left.

40:51.825 --> 40:56.204
Good. When school starts,
you'll have to do this alone.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.962
It'll be fine
as long as you concentrate.

41:06.715 --> 41:09.509
Left, right, left.

41:10.719 --> 41:13.722
<i>It'll be fine
as long as you concentrate.</i>

41:13.889 --> 41:16.183
<i>It'll be fine...</i>

41:17.058 --> 41:21.605
<i>The ABC Auto Sales presents:
Birdai 2100++.</i>

41:21.771 --> 41:24.774
<i>So that you don't get squashed.</i>

41:24.941 --> 41:30.864
The Birdai 2100++ is designed
specifically for you, school kid.

41:30.989 --> 41:36.369
An incredibly epic driving comfort
and breakneck speed.

41:36.578 --> 41:39.706
So, have a safe trip to school!

41:40.499 --> 41:42.751
Have a safe trip!

41:42.918 --> 41:45.670
Drive, don't get squashed.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.591
Watch out!

41:50.217 --> 41:52.677
You need to focus!

41:55.597 --> 41:58.225
A green light. Now we can go.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.896
Go, Pony!

42:04.397 --> 42:06.816
Hurry, hurry!
- Good!

42:06.983 --> 42:09.444
We'll get a good time!

42:11.780 --> 42:14.533
Twelve, twenty-five.
- That's really good!

42:14.699 --> 42:17.452
There's still
some room for improvement.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.622
This is going to be exciting.

42:27.087 --> 42:29.673
Look! A swing set!

42:31.758 --> 42:34.719
Can you swing at school?
- Yes, during breaks.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.722
Breaks are the best. Let's go swing.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.268
Come on!
- Come, now.

42:42.352 --> 42:46.856
I can't remember the last time.
- As a kid, I think.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.277
This makes you feel so liberated.

42:52.195 --> 42:54.489
I love this!

43:15.760 --> 43:18.096
M:
- Hi.

43:19.389 --> 43:25.020
Yeah, I just wanted to say that
Pony has all kinds of skills.

43:26.021 --> 43:29.441
We've even studied
information technology.

43:30.525 --> 43:34.362
You'll probably take the "digital
leap" at your school, too.

43:34.529 --> 43:37.866
What?
- Will you even need books anymore?

43:38.033 --> 43:42.203
We most certainly will.
There's no leaping in our school.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.165
I've got other plans.

43:45.332 --> 43:47.459
<i>Whoopee!</i>

44:04.017 --> 44:07.854
My everyday life needs
more extra and luxury.

44:09.147 --> 44:14.319
My own patio. The more
knick-knack, the better I feel.

44:14.486 --> 44:17.405
I don't get it. Where's my antenna?

44:17.572 --> 44:21.159
Now there's no music.
Hello, is there music?

44:21.284 --> 44:23.370
Oh, but hey!

44:31.044 --> 44:33.213
Let me hear y'all!

44:34.589 --> 44:38.510
The hottest patio in town
is now open! O-o-open.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.846
Open.

44:44.349 --> 44:46.559
Om nom nom.

44:51.481 --> 44:55.610
I have to walk to school.
Children can't drive, you see.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.907
But... you can...

45:02.492 --> 45:04.703
...fly to school!

45:11.084 --> 45:13.962
The best thing about flying is the speed!
- Yeah!

45:14.129 --> 45:18.508
And not knowing whether you'll
get hurt or make it when you jump!

45:25.056 --> 45:28.351
It's your turn, Pony. Try and fly!

45:36.067 --> 45:39.738
Great job, Pony!
Listen, team buddy.

45:39.904 --> 45:44.909
I think you're going to do
super-hyper-mega-great at school.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.495
I guess I'll be fine.

45:47.662 --> 45:51.583
All these playground contraptions
would have to go.

45:53.251 --> 45:57.255
Here, we'd build a running track.
A drinking station over there.

45:57.422 --> 46:00.550
The best pupils will run
1,500 metres during break.

46:00.759 --> 46:03.219
In the winter, they'll ski of course.

46:03.344 --> 46:08.183
The results will be projected there.
We can have a math class as well.

46:09.184 --> 46:13.229
The Kallio primary school
needs no digitalisation.

46:13.354 --> 46:16.357
We need perspiration!
- Perspiration? Hmm.

46:16.900 --> 46:21.279
I see, you're already
practising for school.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.948
What do you think of my plans?

46:24.991 --> 46:27.285
I can't ski.

46:27.994 --> 46:30.079
Everyone will ski.

46:31.664 --> 46:34.292
Everyone will ski.

46:36.586 --> 46:39.714
<i>Everyone will ski.</i>

46:45.261 --> 46:48.014
<i>Everyone will ski.</i>

46:53.812 --> 46:56.981
<i>Everyone will ski.</i>

47:07.700 --> 47:10.036
<i>What a horrible old man!</i>

47:10.203 --> 47:13.623
<i>If he won't let kids play,
he's a monster! A real moose!</i>

47:13.832 --> 47:17.085
What's wrong with him?
- Maybe he's sick.

47:17.252 --> 47:20.505
When I studied in the...
Scientific University,

47:20.672 --> 47:23.216
people talked a lot about

47:23.341 --> 47:25.635
moose torturers.

47:26.219 --> 47:28.930
Well, is there a cure?

47:29.722 --> 47:34.394
Hard to say from a distance. I'd have
to get closer for a diagnosis.

47:39.357 --> 47:42.110
Do you see anything,
Agent Double Dough Seven?

47:42.277 --> 47:45.196
Only darkness,
honourable Whinnying Doctor.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.740
I need the Spy's Handbook.

47:47.949 --> 47:51.786
This book has
all the wisdom in the world.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.375
First, we look for tracks
in the ground.

47:57.542 --> 48:00.879
Then we'll determine
the patient's territory

48:01.045 --> 48:03.715
and map out his habits.
- Okay.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.561
Look!

48:22.817 --> 48:25.695
That must be his turd!

48:31.743 --> 48:35.204
Deer tracks look
a little bit like turds. Look.

48:37.206 --> 48:40.585
Is the headmaster secretly
an even-toed ungulate?

48:40.752 --> 48:42.754
Why not?

48:45.298 --> 48:48.217
The even-toed ungulate has landed.

48:58.478 --> 49:01.522
Agent Double Dough Seven
and the Whinnying Doctor

49:01.689 --> 49:05.401
were ordered to spy
on a very suspicious target

49:05.526 --> 49:09.530
who, in the worst case,
might have an incurable disease!

49:09.697 --> 49:12.325
You need some agent gear.

49:17.747 --> 49:20.208
It doesn't help.

49:21.125 --> 49:24.712
Hurry!
- A periscope? A stethoscope?

49:24.879 --> 49:27.340
Ah, the psychedeliscope!

49:34.180 --> 49:36.474
I can't see Teppo.

49:36.975 --> 49:39.435
What a challenging mission.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.479
Oh, try these!

49:45.858 --> 49:50.405
Will the Whinnying Doctor succeed in
diagnosing the ungulate's disease?

49:50.989 --> 49:56.202
Will the Whinnying Doctor identify
the bacteria in the headmaster's gut?

49:56.369 --> 49:58.871
Soon we'll find out.
- Antlers!

49:59.455 --> 50:03.042
I knew it!
Hoof-mouth-and-antler disease!

50:04.711 --> 50:07.422
Sparks! Fire!

50:07.547 --> 50:10.216
What is he doing?
- F-f-fire!

50:10.383 --> 50:14.470
Patients with hoof-mouth-and-antler
disease like to barbecue!

50:14.595 --> 50:18.307
Raw meat!
- Raw meat.

50:33.448 --> 50:37.035
Whinnying Doctor, Whinny,
we have no time to waste.

50:37.201 --> 50:42.623
The hoof-mouth-and-antler disease
is dangerous to animals and people.

50:42.790 --> 50:46.210
It can infect billions in seconds!
- Schoolchildren!

50:46.377 --> 50:49.505
That's right!
And it causes terrible tantrums.

50:49.630 --> 50:52.592
And pimples, on your butt!
And you want your own...

50:52.759 --> 50:56.179
...antlers!
- Yes! And guess what, Whinny.

50:56.345 --> 51:00.183
The disease can only be destroyed
by a scalding hot temperature.

51:00.600 --> 51:05.188
We have to save the schoolchildren!
- But how, Agent?

51:08.274 --> 51:10.943
Buddy, we'll barbecue him.

51:21.329 --> 51:23.748
Are you sure about this?

51:23.915 --> 51:28.961
The hoof-mouth-and-antler disease
can only be destroyed by frying it.

51:30.630 --> 51:33.674
Are you sure?
- Of course!

51:33.841 --> 51:38.221
People toast themselves in the sun
because it's so healthy.

51:45.686 --> 51:48.523
We're the best buddy team ever.

52:28.688 --> 52:31.440
Excellent! Great job, Whinny!

52:58.092 --> 53:00.761
What do you think you're doing!

53:01.971 --> 53:07.101
It wasn't me! It was Birdboy's idea!
- What Bird?

53:07.727 --> 53:09.896
You lit the fire!

53:10.062 --> 53:13.316
You could've burned down
the whole building!

53:13.482 --> 53:16.861
This could have turned
into a catastrophe!

53:17.028 --> 53:21.908
The thing is, your ponies and birds
are completely out of control!

53:22.074 --> 53:27.371
Your imagination will get you
in serious trouble in school!

54:10.831 --> 54:12.833
Hi.

54:15.419 --> 54:18.297
Our barbecue got a bit out of hand.

54:19.298 --> 54:21.300
Oh.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.887
The school starts next week.

54:25.054 --> 54:29.141
Let's see... I don't think
I'm busy next week.

54:29.350 --> 54:34.105
Pedicure and hair removal
can be rescheduled. I'll be there!

54:35.898 --> 54:38.693
You can't come to school with me.

54:38.818 --> 54:41.570
I have to go there all by myself.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.678
Are you really sure?

55:07.138 --> 55:11.851
Everyone says that birds
and ponies only cause trouble.

55:13.602 --> 55:16.397
Everything went totally wrong.

55:50.681 --> 55:52.850
Bye then.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.313
Ta-dah!

57:03.629 --> 57:06.507
Where's your pony stuff?

57:06.674 --> 57:10.928
I threw them away.
It got too crazy and over the top.

57:16.100 --> 57:20.312
Well, there was no need
to throw everything away.

57:20.521 --> 57:23.232
It's up to you
if it goes over the top.

57:23.441 --> 57:26.777
You're in control. You're the boss.

57:28.571 --> 57:31.699
Like the headmaster is the boss?
- Exactly.

57:31.866 --> 57:36.078
He's the boss at school.
You're the boss when you play.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.711
AUGUST

58:00.978 --> 58:03.647
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Headmaster.</i>

58:05.232 --> 58:08.027
<i>I'm sorry about the fire.</i>

58:53.113 --> 58:55.115
Who is it?
- Sorry!

58:55.282 --> 58:57.660
You're not going anywhere!

58:58.869 --> 59:03.624
You didn't see anything.
I mean, what you saw is not here.

59:04.667 --> 59:07.670
Okay. But it's really cool.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.549
Is it?

59:12.132 --> 59:15.094
Yes. Did you make it yourself?

59:15.261 --> 59:17.972
I did.
- It's lovely.

59:21.016 --> 59:24.562
I think so too. And last week,

59:24.728 --> 59:27.606
I finally got those eyelashes.

59:27.773 --> 59:32.111
And the lips might be a bit too much,
but I kinda like them.

59:33.320 --> 59:36.574
This is my secret game, sort of.

59:37.074 --> 59:39.618
So you play here!
- No, I don't!

59:40.411 --> 59:45.457
That's not fair! You say kids can't
play, but you play here yourself!

59:49.336 --> 59:51.839
Why don't you drive it?

59:52.756 --> 59:57.177
What would it look like if a middle-
aged geezer drove a car like this?

59:57.344 --> 01:00:01.265
It'd look great! People would
think the driver is a funny guy,

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:04.059
and not a curmudgeon like you.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:07.354
A headmaster has to stay in control.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.734
Otherwise I might start doing
something crazy at school!

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.695
So it's a no. I'll stay in my garage.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.452
Do you have the hoof-mouth- and-antler disease?
- What?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.831
It causes grumpiness
and pimples on your butt.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.473
Yoo-hoo!

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.152
Admit it. You like to play.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:06.705
Okay, I admit it.
It feels good to act silly sometimes.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.668
That's right.
It makes you feel so liberated.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:20.511
They're here to pick up the dumpster.
- My muzzle is in there!

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.601
Should you go and get it back?

01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.737
You've got to drive!

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:42.157
Drive!

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.801
Cool ride.

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:48.909
Hold on to your tail, horsey.
Let's go.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:40.919
Whew, what a ride.
- It was fun!

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.508
Bye then! I've got something to do.

01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:52.890
Hello.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:57.102
Hi! I was just about
to give you a ring.

01:04:57.269 --> 01:05:01.064
Listen, let's cancel the changes
for the school yard.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.651
I've got other plans.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.487
Yeah...

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:36.224
Howdy, buddy friend! My bestie!
- Birdboy!

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:42.606
An insane amount of sugar!
You're the best genius in the world.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:46.234
Welcome back,
Agent Double Dough Seven!

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:50.072
Greetings from Whinny.
Do you like your headquarters?

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:53.867
It's immensely epic,
over-the-top crazy!

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.579
Double Dough Seven is grateful.
Over and out.

01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:23.271
AUGUST

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:29.194
I'm ready!
- Good morning, schoolgirl!

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.245
I love your new painting.

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.376
<i>So the school finally started.</i>

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:30.213
<i>Teppo had come up with
a fun idea for the first day.</i>

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:35.427
<i>We had a costume party. Everyone
could dress as anything they liked.</i>

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.644
M:
- Hi.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.314
I'm a little nervous.

01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:49.983
Are you?
- Not at all.

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:53.779
Come.

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:59.117
<i>Even though I became a schoolgirl,
nothing really changed.</i>

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.995
<i>Except for Teppo.</i>

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.790
<i>Now he likes everything.</i>

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:10.128
<i>Besides, there are no skeletons
or even-toed ungulates.</i>

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:13.548
Miisu Siltanen.
- Mai Hukkinen.

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:17.344
Viljam Vänttinen.
- Veera Kiljander.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:21.223
Lauri Kivelä.
- Alma Seppänen.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:24.100
Aamos Vänskä.

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:27.979
<i>And we don't have to ski
during breaks.</i>

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.858
<i>We're allowed to play!</i>

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.298
The school starts!

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:58.051
School is the best time in life.

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:10.647
Pony races dangerously.
She puts everything at stake.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.567
Want to buy a vacuum cleaner?

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:16.862
Put your head in a toilet.
We'll never call you again!

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:32.586
This is so wonderful!
Marvellous!

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:39.926
One ninety-eight!

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.604
Pony, a-ha, Pony!

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:55.233
Horses don't go to school!

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:04.826
Finished it!

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.704
Look, a turd!

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.848
Now I'll finish this!
