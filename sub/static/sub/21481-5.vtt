00:39.572 --> 00:42.302
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.568
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.109
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.281 --> 00:50.272
I see you've been spending
a lot of time with Shawn.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.112
People see her, they see a woman.
A beautiful woman.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.914
And they might forget that inside
she's just a little girl.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.114
I'm glad she has you around
to be a friend.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.383
You killed people.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.390
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.722
We are in a war.
It's gonna cost money.

01:05.799 --> 01:06.891
You sold us out.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.026
I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn,
and I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.263
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge

01:13.440 --> 01:16.637
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.300
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sarah.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.706
I'm Maia's sister.

01:19.879 --> 01:23.144
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking the inhibitor?

01:23.316 --> 01:25.307
- Who are you?
- I'm Lindsey.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.654
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.681
Tyler! Duncan!

01:31.124 --> 01:32.523
You've been here
ever since you walked

01:32.692 --> 01:34.182
through the front door of my house.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.622
You're in the future.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.195
We had to bring you here, Maia,
you and your friends.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.457
Before we put you back
in your new time,

01:40.633 --> 01:42.123
we'll make you forget your mother.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.496
Please, don't!

01:43.670 --> 01:45.968
They'll forget you too.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.546
Hey.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.481
Marco, they're beautiful.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.883
How did you know I like anemones?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.081
You remember
that bad ltalian restaurant?

02:05.258 --> 02:07.453
I asked you what your favorite
flower was, and you said:

02:07.627 --> 02:09.389
Anemones.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.223
Most guys don't even listen
to table talk.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.422
You not only heard me,
you remembered.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.329
Do you know how lucky
you're gonna get tonight?

02:15.502 --> 02:18.062
Then my plan is working.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.567
I thought it was just gonna be
the two of us.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.176
It is.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.905
Then who is the other plate for?

02:28.715 --> 02:30.239
Di?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.145
I don't know what I was thinking.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.701
- Are you having fun?
- Of course, I'm having fun.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.498
You sure you don't want
a turn at the wheel?

02:53.673 --> 02:54.765
It's your fantasy.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.431
Okay, honey. Hold on.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.885
Look out!

03:14.961 --> 03:17.054
- You all right?
- I think so.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.296
- You saw her too, right?
- Of course, I did.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.332
Why would a girl
be in the middle of the road?

03:23.503 --> 03:25.528
- I have no idea.
- A joy ride in the country.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.104
That's what we agreed on, right?

03:27.273 --> 03:29.104
A great car, a deserted road.

03:29.275 --> 03:32.039
Hitting some kid at 80 miles plus?
Where the hell does that come in?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.873
What happened to her?!

03:35.582 --> 03:37.345
Thomas.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.119
Hey!

03:41.721 --> 03:43.450
Hey. Hey.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.591
Hey, what...? You...?

03:46.759 --> 03:47.953
You okay?

03:56.002 --> 03:57.731
Who was she?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.372
I have no idea.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.363
How many times
have we done this?

05:04.537 --> 05:06.562
Gone away in one
of these fantasy worlds you create?

05:06.739 --> 05:08.707
- A dozen times? Two dozen?
- At least.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.638
And these worlds,
they always feel real.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.644
Except this time, a girl without a face
appears out of nowhere.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.940
It felt more like a nightmare.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.016
But something like that was bound
to happen sooner or later.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.415
I build these worlds
out of our memories.

05:21.587 --> 05:24.488
I guess this time I dredged up
something incomplete.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.820
A fragment of something.
A sort of mental hiccup.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.155
Okay, but this girl?
Is she part of my memory or yours?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.821
Yours, mine, both.
There's no way to know, is there?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.990
One of us might have
seen her picture in a book,

05:35.168 --> 05:36.635
or seen her in the street.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.737
Yeah, we just
don't remember her face.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.338
It might have just been a glimpse.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.440
Yeah, well,

05:42.909 --> 05:45.275
that glimpse pretty much
ruined our night.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.679
Well, tomorrow night will be better.
I promise.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.784
Anywhere you wanna go,
anywhere we wanna go,

05:52.952 --> 05:55.944
- and anything we wanna do.
- You know, for his 1 2th birthday

05:56.122 --> 05:59.023
I took Kyle fishing
up at the Dosewallips River.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.353
I thought maybe the three
of us could go there.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.119
That sounds great.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.288
And maybe this time we could
actually catch some fish.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.796
Okay.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.897
I don't know what's wrong
with my bedroom.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.870
Or yours for that matter.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.608
We've already done it there
a bunch of times.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.509
Experts say you should do
adventurous things

06:22.682 --> 06:24.479
to keep relationships
more interesting.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.447
They say that, huh?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.912
What could be more adventurous
than a quickie in the staircase?

06:30.556 --> 06:34.856
Did you switch
from Encyclopedia Britannica

06:35.027 --> 06:37.052
to Cosmo magazine or something?
What--?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.822
Well, I read lots of stuff.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.270
- I'll take the elevator.
- Devon.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.804
How embarrassing for her.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.443
Isabelle, just stop! Just...

06:57.884 --> 07:00.250
What's the matter, Shawn?
What's wrong?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.479
She's not gonna tell my father.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.555
- She'd be too afraid of me.
- lsabelle.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.090
She's gonna tell someone,
and then they'll tell someone else.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.694
And then, everybody's gonna know.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.535
Where's your partner?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.106
Late.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.371
A 4400, Christopher Dubov, was
attacked outside his home last night.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.310
I wanna know if we're looking
at a hate crime.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.040
It says he's a lawyer
at Teller and Dutch.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.014
That's a major mergers
and acquisitions firm.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.120
They've been all over
the financial pages this year.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.256
Yeah, which makes him
a high profile 4400.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.186
A target for somebody
looking to make a point.

07:39.358 --> 07:40.723
No, it makes him a corporate raider

07:40.893 --> 07:42.827
who's put a lot of people
in the unemployment line.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.123
His 4400 status isn't the only motive
someone might have to attack him.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.132
Just talk to him.
See if he can write you up a list.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.863
- Oh, alarm clock need new batteries?
- No, it's a crappy morning.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.698
Are you opening up a newsstand?

07:56.876 --> 08:00.471
No. Just a project
that I'm working on.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.704
So, what do we got?

08:03.182 --> 08:04.911
Yeah, you could call it a hate crime.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.014
My son, Michael, certainly hates me.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.779
Your son did this to you, Mr. Dubov?

08:09.956 --> 08:11.253
His mom and I split up.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.686
He blames me.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.919
I'm the one who introduced her to Bob,
her new husband.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.524
I knew they belonged together.
I could smell it.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.791
- I'm not sure I follow.
- It's my ability.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.527
It showed up once I stopped taking
the promicin inhibitor.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.432
I can smell pheromones.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.073
You mean the stuff people put out
to attract other people?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.903
- Weird, huh?
- Things between my wife and l

08:31.077 --> 08:32.544
haven't been too good for a while.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.340
Then I met Bob.
He's my new dentist.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.313
Right away, there was
something familiar about him.

08:38.484 --> 08:42.250
Then I realized what it was.
He smelled just like Caroline.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.785
So I made her an appointment.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.482
I had to know whether
or not they belonged together.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.059
Let me guess, love at first sight.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.426
Sight, smell, whatever.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.895
You and your son
look very happy together.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.902
Those were taken
when Michael was 1 0.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.737
Ten.

09:00.973 --> 09:04.067
That's a... That's a great age.

09:04.243 --> 09:07.701
Mr. Dubov, do you want us
to talk to Michael?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.576
Explain to him that assault
is a serious crime?

09:10.750 --> 09:11.808
No, forget it.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.680
I'm sorry my secretary called you.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.687
Besides, I think I know a way
to get him to forgive me.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.291
There's a new bar
around the corner.

09:20.459 --> 09:24.395
One of the waitresses,
she smells just like my kid.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.258
Let's hope she's not married.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.831
Amen to that.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.570
You know, I bet if that guy quit his job
and opened up a dating service,

09:35.741 --> 09:37.834
he'd make a fortune.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.376
I'm not sure how turning
a corporate lawyer into cupid

09:40.546 --> 09:42.480
is gonna help save the future.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.445
Wha--? Hey.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.812
Honey, what's going on?

09:49.622 --> 09:53.922
- Are you all right?
- Dubov was gone for five years, right?

09:54.293 --> 09:55.624
I...

09:55.795 --> 09:57.990
I bet his son really missed him.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.930
Probably.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.431
I mean, every 4400
left someone behind.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.127
Are you sure
it's not something else?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.838
No. It's fine, really.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.999
It'll pass.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.005
Okay.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.247
Physical.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.279
You and lsabelle?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.118
You wanna explain that?

10:31.230 --> 10:34.199
I asked you a question! What is going
on between you and my daughter?!

10:34.367 --> 10:36.232
We never planned
on going behind your back.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.963
In fact, we never planned it at all.
It just kind of happened.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.073
Friendship! Remember?
We talked about that.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.708
That's as far as it
was supposed to go!

10:43.876 --> 10:45.707
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.346
I'm sorry too.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.846
- lsabelle is just a child!
- No, Richard, she isn't.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.211
She's emotionally immature
and you took advantage of that!

10:53.386 --> 10:55.752
That's what you think?
You know me better. That's not fair.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.718
I know your judgment stinks,
that's what I know.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.619
You're gonna stay away
from my daughter.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.316
I'm not gonna make
that promise to you.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.355
I am not giving you a choice here,
you understand me?

11:05.898 --> 11:09.834
This thing between the two of you,
it is over.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.168
I don't recall saying "come in."

11:13.339 --> 11:15.933
I thought perhaps a referee
might be in order.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.235
May I advise you gentlemen
to go to your neutral corners?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.038
This is a private conversation,
Matthew!

11:20.212 --> 11:23.409
It may have started out that way, but
I assure you, it's becoming very public.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.209
I could hear you out in the hallway.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.284
And for the record,
I happen to agree with Richard.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.853
This relationship with lsabelle
is ill-advised at best.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.751
I thought referees didn't take sides?

11:31.924 --> 11:34.916
If I were you, Shawn, I'd take this
opportunity to make a graceful exit.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.686
Think about what I said, Shawn.

11:38.497 --> 11:39.964
I'm expecting you to do
the right thing.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.243
What's for lunch?

11:57.116 --> 11:58.845
Prosciutto with figs.

11:59.018 --> 12:02.454
Rosemary chicken,
couscous, and raspberries.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.680
Wow. You know,
when Kyle and I used to go fishing,

12:04.857 --> 12:07.087
we'd take a half a dozen
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches

12:07.259 --> 12:10.194
- and think we were living like kings.
- I like to think the reality I create

12:10.362 --> 12:11.989
is a little bit tastier than that.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.256
Good.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.992
Hey, we gotta get going. Hey, Kyle!

12:16.869 --> 12:18.336
Come on, buddy!

12:18.504 --> 12:20.699
Come on, Kyle. Let's go.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.665
Come on--

12:28.481 --> 12:30.073
It's you.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.846
The girl on the road.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.315
That's right. You remember.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.749
Maia.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.879
Maia.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.883
Have we met before?

12:41.660 --> 12:43.525
Don't be silly.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.163
No, I'm sorry, l...

12:45.965 --> 12:46.954
I don't remember you.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.293
Sure you do.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.198
Think harder.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.869
Is that why you keep showing up?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.439
Because you want me
to remember?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.702
I'm here because
you brought me here.

13:02.748 --> 13:06.445
There has to be a reason
why this girl keeps showing up.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.246
There was nothing familiar about her?
Nothing at all?

13:10.422 --> 13:12.083
No.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.418
But she kept acting
like we knew each other.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.322
And if she's right,
if I did bring here there,

13:16.495 --> 13:19.623
then I must know her
from somewhere.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.730
Tom.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.396
Shouldn't you be at work?

13:29.575 --> 13:33.033
- Jarvis said you called in sick.
- Well, I'm allowed.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.813
Thanks for checking in on me.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.915
Diana, talk to me, will you?

13:39.985 --> 13:40.974
What the hell's all this?

13:43.489 --> 13:47.323
Just a project I'm working on.
I mentioned it to you.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.361
- Who's this supposed to be?
- I wish I knew.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.259
I know this might sound creepy,
but I was up all night last night

13:53.432 --> 13:56.629
cutting up pictures of little girls. None
of them seemed to be the right one.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.667
I mean, I think I'm going crazy.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.930
Then we both are.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.838
You know those little dream vacations
I take with Alana?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.533
This little girl keeps showing up
in them. This little blond girl.

14:05.711 --> 14:08.373
Says her name is Maia.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.506
Maia?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.048
- Oh, Tom.
- What?

14:14.353 --> 14:17.322
You have to come with me.
I have to show you something.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.637
Who is she, Tom?

14:34.306 --> 14:35.705
Who is Maia?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.133
I don't know.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.543
I've already checked. There's no
mention of Maia in any of our case files.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.381
Okay, well, maybe we met her
together someplace else?

14:50.155 --> 14:51.645
Maybe at one
of Garrity's barbecues?

14:51.824 --> 14:53.223
No, that does not feel right.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.417
I didn't just meet this girl once
at a barbecue.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.152
I know her better than that.

14:57.329 --> 14:58.353
All right, just calm down.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.896
Well, there's a reason this girl
is haunting us, Tom, okay?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.591
She's out there somewhere,
and she wants us to find her.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.327
Right now the only place
I know she exists

15:05.504 --> 15:08.234
is in one of these dream worlds
Alana and I create.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.569
Well then, I need for Alana
to take me there.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.371
I need to meet this girl, talk to her.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.570
No, but you wouldn't really
be talking to her, Diana.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.342
You'd just be talking to whatever
your subconscious remembers of her.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.209
Well, maybe that would be enough
for me figure out who she is.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.808
How do I sound?

15:46.478 --> 15:47.809
Like you've been playing for years.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.914
I haven't. It's my first time.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.276
I kind of figured that.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.385
Isabelle, do you have a minute?

15:55.554 --> 15:57.351
Have a seat.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.457
Isabelle, you know I'm proud
of you, don't you?

16:10.035 --> 16:12.868
This is about Shawn
and I having sex, isn't it?

16:13.038 --> 16:16.132
That's part of it, yeah.
Yeah, but only a part of it.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.336
Right now everything's new to you.

16:18.777 --> 16:23.805
You're learning so much so fast.
How to be a daughter.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.513
- A friend.
- A lover.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.347
That part you might be learning
too fast.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.318
You don't want me
to get my feelings hurt.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.084
I would just like if you and Shawn
slow down.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.193
- Stop sleeping together?
- For the time being.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.296
There's no reason to stop.

16:39.064 --> 16:42.397
Shawn cares about me.
I care about Shawn.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.135
The sex is wonderful.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.238
It makes us both very happy.
It should make you happy too.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.001
Maybe it should, but it doesn't.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.268
I suppose that's normal.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.145
But everything is gonna be okay.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.076
Shawn would never
do anything to hurt me.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.478
He's way too smart for that.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.853
So you see?
You have nothing to worry about.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.626
I wonder if anyone at the Center
has a cello.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.767
So, what do I have to do?

17:19.938 --> 17:21.963
Well, the main thing is to relax.

17:22.741 --> 17:26.176
Well, I usually close my eyes
and count backwards from ten.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.074
Before I reach zero,
we're somewhere else.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.078
Have any idea where you want
Alana to take you?

17:30.616 --> 17:32.846
We usually have
a destination picked out.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.111
Well, wherever Maia is.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.278
You can do that, can't you?
You can take me to her?

17:37.456 --> 17:39.481
She seems to show up
anyplace we go.

17:39.658 --> 17:40.784
So it's really up to you.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.086
Well, let's just keep it simple.
How about my apartment?

17:43.262 --> 17:44.695
All right.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.797
Now, let's begin.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.347
Alana,

18:03.515 --> 18:05.779
this is not my apartment.

18:05.951 --> 18:09.717
I know. I'm not quite sure
what just happened.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.350
You done talking to your friend?

18:14.693 --> 18:17.093
- You're Maia.
- Stop fooling around.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.890
Come on. He's waiting for us.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.307
There you are, Ms. Skouris.
The documents are all ready.

18:30.476 --> 18:31.773
If you'll just have a seat,

18:31.944 --> 18:34.538
and sign where indicated,
we can finish up.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.622
You still wanna do this, don't you?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.101
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge

19:04.276 --> 19:07.871
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.209
So witnessed by me,
Henry Biederman,

19:11.617 --> 19:14.711
of the 1 0th Circuit Family Court
of Seattle.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.816
You know, some of us
have to look far and wide

19:16.989 --> 19:19.321
to find the people we'll call family.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.760
You two had to look
clear across time.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.726
Diana, let me introduce you
to your daughter, Maia.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.388
Maia, say hello to Mommy.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.080
Oh, my God, Maia.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.856
Oh, my God.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.335
- Oh, my God.
- Diana, what happened?

20:04.503 --> 20:06.027
She was kidnapped, Tom.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.799
She was taken by a woman
pretending to be her sister.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.134
She took Maia,

20:10.309 --> 20:13.301
Tyler Downing, Lindsey Hammond,
and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.

20:13.478 --> 20:15.343
Do you remember any of this?

20:15.514 --> 20:16.674
No. No, I don't.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.076
So this woman took these children

20:18.250 --> 20:20.616
and somehow made everyone forget
they ever existed.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.686
Yes, but they existed.
Maia Rutledge disappeared

20:22.854 --> 20:25.448
from Crescent City, California,
March 3rd, 1 946.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.091
So wait, you're saying
she was abducted,

20:27.259 --> 20:29.454
then returned with the other 4400s,
then taken again.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.152
And none of us remember this
but you.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.163
- It's like they've wiped our memories.
- But why?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.392
Because they didn't want us
looking for them.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.095
The 4400 were taken and returned
to change the future in some way.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.968
Maybe Maia and the others were taken
so that they could change it again.

20:43.141 --> 20:47.669
I don't know and I don't care. All I know
is four days ago she was here with me.

20:47.846 --> 20:50.508
And I need you to believe
that I have a daughter named Maia

20:50.682 --> 20:51.979
and that she's been taken from me.

20:52.150 --> 20:55.642
I don't remember Maia,
or the kidnapping, or any of it.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.415
The idea that my memory's been
messed with scares the hell out of me.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.582
But after everything
we've been through with the 4400,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.320
yes, Diana, I believe you.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.506
- Hello?
- Richard Tyler?

21:20.679 --> 21:23.204
- Yes, who's this?
- My name is Daniel Armand.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.350
- You know who I am?
- With the NOVA Group?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.212
I think it's time you and I met,
Richard.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.580
We have a lot to discuss.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.450
I have a lot to say to you too,
but I don't think you'll wanna hear it.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.557
Well, now you see,
that's the problem right there.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.454
We should be allies,
not adversaries.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.061
My group and your organization
have the same goals.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.630
We're advocating
for the rights of the 4400.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.199
Except that you advocate
through assassination and intimidation.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.892
We lack the strength in numbers,
Richard,

21:45.070 --> 21:47.197
so we use the tools at our disposal.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.272
Is that what you called me for?
To have a debate?

21:49.441 --> 21:51.136
I called to arrange a truce.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.834
And to talk about Shawn Farrell.

21:53.412 --> 21:57.041
- You'll make more threats against him?
- No, we need to discuss his future.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.740
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,

22:00.452 --> 22:02.044
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.

22:09.094 --> 22:12.188
I should meet him on the corner
of Pike and Gorch Thursday at 4:00.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.388
And then?

22:13.565 --> 22:15.863
A car will be there to pick me up

22:16.034 --> 22:18.059
and take me someplace
for a face to face with Armand.

22:18.236 --> 22:21.034
Sounds to me like the NOVA Group's
been reading too much John le Carre.

22:21.573 --> 22:24.235
- What did you say?
- I told him I'd think about it.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.673
What is there to think about?
You're not going.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.005
Let's not rush to judgment.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.943
I've dealt with this guy before,
remember?

22:30.115 --> 22:32.049
He wants one thing.
You know what it is: Money.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.684
And probably the names

22:33.852 --> 22:35.945
and addresses of every 4400
in our computer.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.716
If they have an ability that he can use,
he will exploit it and people will die.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.791
People have already died.
Maybe I can stop him.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.393
Are you gonna make him
see the light?

22:43.562 --> 22:45.086
No, but I can stop him
from killing you.

22:45.263 --> 22:48.027
How? How?

22:48.900 --> 22:52.063
By putting this place and everything
that we've worked for in jeopardy?

22:52.237 --> 22:55.400
- I won't let you do that.
- Noble words, but may I remind you?

22:55.574 --> 22:58.907
If the NOVA Group wants to strike
at you, I don't think we can prevent it.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.806
Thank you for the pep talk, Matthew.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.879
I'm just being realistic.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.312
So am l. If I don't show,
it's like a declaration of war,

23:05.484 --> 23:07.281
and we all know
who the first casualty will be.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.913
You and Jordan Collier built this place.
You're its heart and soul.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.456
Then listen to me, Richard.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.093
I tried to deal
with these people before.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.196
It was a disaster.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.628
I'm warning you. I'm asking you:

23:21.800 --> 23:23.665
Please do not make
the same mistake.

23:23.835 --> 23:24.824
Please.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.668
Skouris, I have a list right here

23:29.841 --> 23:32.742
of ever 4400 who returned that night
to Highland Beach.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.902
There's no Maia Rutledge.
There's no Tyler Downing.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.308
There's no Lindsey Hammond.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.847
I've explained that:
They've been erased.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.814
From the records,
from our memories.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.454
Someone has tried to wipe out
every trace of them.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.611
We talked to the families.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.815
In the last week,
all of them have been haunted

23:46.992 --> 23:49.358
by phantom memories of children
they supposedly lost years ago.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.587
Okay, let's say I am buying
any of this, and I'm not.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.357
But if I did, we don't even know
where they were taken.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.160
The future?

23:56.334 --> 23:59.269
- That's kind of out of our jurisdiction.
- I've seen Maia.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.530
I've spoken to her.

24:00.705 --> 24:01.763
We both have.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.464
Look, you're asking me
to commit manpower

24:03.642 --> 24:06.372
and resources to find a little girl
that only exists

24:06.545 --> 24:08.877
in some shared fantasyland
you guys play around in.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.708
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.372
You guys through?

24:12.551 --> 24:15.349
Because I think I found your kids.

24:17.889 --> 24:20.050
Here we go. Watch this.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.886
That's him. That's Tyler.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.358
It's dated September 1 9th, 1 893.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.793
They sent him back
further into the past. Why?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.593
Well, that I can't tell you.
But Tyler Downing

24:29.768 --> 24:33.169
did graduate first in his class
from Yale University in Engineering.

24:33.338 --> 24:34.862
I knew I'd heard the name before.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.134
In 1 91 5, he helped develop
synthetic petroleum.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.801
You drove to work this morning
because of this guy.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.412
This is from the estate
of Robert Goddard.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.745
You know, the rocket guy.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.217
He adopted an orphan
named Lindsey Hammond.

24:50.388 --> 24:53.118
She lived with the family,
eventually worked in his lab.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.054
And she invented
all the composite materials

24:55.227 --> 24:56.751
used in the first lunar colonies.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.260
Okay, so, what about Maia?
Did you find any photos of her?

24:59.664 --> 25:02.963
No, she was a little harder
to track down.

25:03.134 --> 25:06.865
But I finally found something.

25:07.372 --> 25:08.600
That's Maia's handwriting.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.037
It's a diary from Maia Rutledge

25:11.209 --> 25:14.372
dated April 1 9th
through September 2nd, 1 847.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.411
It was written while
she was part of a wagon train

25:16.581 --> 25:18.014
making its way
along the Oregon Trail.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.050
I'm sorry. She crossed the Rockies
in a covered wagon?

25:23.622 --> 25:24.611
No.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.786
She died of smallpox
in October of '47.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.953
She was 25.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.134
No. I'm sorry, Shawn.
It's not my father's decision.

25:41.306 --> 25:44.434
- It's mine. I'm not breaking up with you.
- It's got nothing to do with your dad.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.076
Not really.

25:47.679 --> 25:50.614
You and I made some decisions,
we did some things.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.545
We did what we wanted to do.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.117
And there's no reason
we can't keep doing that.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.152
We'll be more careful.
My father won't know it.

25:57.322 --> 25:59.756
That's not gonna work.
Not anymore.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.756
Lying to him, going behind his back?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.785
We've done enough of that.

26:03.962 --> 26:07.454
The truth is, lsabelle,
I kind of took advantage of you.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.759
And I'm really sorry.

26:10.802 --> 26:13.134
You are so sweet
the way you worry about me.

26:17.676 --> 26:20.270
I don't want this relationship to end.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.904
So it's not going to.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.892
I need to see her.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.324
Please, can you take me
to see my daughter?

26:37.495 --> 26:39.929
Diana, you know it's not really Maia
you'd be seeing.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.690
Oh, I don't care.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.834
Today I found out that my daughter,
who I loved,

26:44.002 --> 26:47.199
was sent back into the past
and died 1 50 years ago.

26:47.372 --> 26:50.671
I'm sorry, but that's gonna take me
a while to come to terms with.

26:50.842 --> 26:51.866
I just...

26:52.043 --> 26:54.807
Please let me do this.
I need to say goodbye.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.470
Give me your coat.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.843
I'll put some coffee on.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.544
Ready?

27:11.396 --> 27:13.057
Mommy?

27:13.898 --> 27:16.025
Mommy, I'm starving.
Can we have pancakes?

27:19.838 --> 27:21.965
I'll help make them.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.471
Okay.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.406
Well, I'll need the eggs
from the fridge.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.982
And bring me the big, plastic bowl.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.158
Oh, my God. Alana! Alana! Alana!

27:43.328 --> 27:45.387
Honey, my God, you're bleeding.
You okay?

27:45.563 --> 27:47.326
I think so.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.967
Diana. Diana, can you hear me?

27:50.135 --> 27:52.399
Diana, look at me.
What the hell happened?!

27:52.570 --> 27:54.037
I thought I was bringing us out.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.229
Well, why isn't she awake?

27:55.407 --> 27:58.069
I couldn't hold onto her.
It's as if she pulled away.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.371
Thomas, I think she's still
inside the dream world.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.377
Wait, how can she be in there
without you?

28:03.748 --> 28:05.841
I'm not sure.

28:06.384 --> 28:09.945
When you and I separate,
we let go of the illusion.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.782
But she's not letting go.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.719
Wha--? She's not coming out?

28:13.892 --> 28:16.122
I think she's happy there
with her daughter,

28:16.294 --> 28:19.525
and she has no intention
of ever leaving.

28:20.665 --> 28:21.791
Oh, come on.

28:26.938 --> 28:30.101
At first, I thought she'd suffered some
kind of intracerebral hemorrhage.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.709
But the MRl didn't show
any bleeding in the brain.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.902
So she hasn't suffered
any damage?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.708
Not yet, but the EEG
was very troubling.

28:38.116 --> 28:41.347
Her brain activity is far above normal
and continues to accelerate.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.647
The same is true for her heart rate,
her breathing, her blood pressure.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.882
They're all redlining, if you will.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.286
Any idea what's causing it?

28:48.460 --> 28:50.257
I really can't say at the moment.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.726
Her metabolic rate can't stay
at this level for very long.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.489
Eventually her organs will fail.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.224
What, she could die?

28:56.401 --> 29:00.838
Unless we can slow down her rates,
we're looking at a very poor outcome.

29:01.272 --> 29:02.830
Does she have any family?

29:05.810 --> 29:08.802
- Yeah.
- You should call them.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.078
I need to talk to her, Alana.
Can you do that?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.481
Take me to see Diana?

29:24.796 --> 29:27.458
- Push me a little, Mommy.
- Okay, I'm pushing you.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.259
Then make it higher.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.026
Look, not too high.

29:31.202 --> 29:33.670
But that's the whole fun.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.931
She has a point.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.605
I thought I'd be seeing you two.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.713
I didn't hurt you, did l?
It felt a little jarring when you left.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.873
- No, I'm fine.
- You, on the other hand, are not.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.177
Well, that's where you're wrong,
because I feel great.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.718
You're in an lCU, Diana.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.981
I thought I might end up there.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.682
What's my heart rate?
Is it 1 70? 1 75?

29:54.859 --> 29:56.656
- Higher.
- That still probably gives me

29:56.828 --> 30:00.696
what, anywhere from three weeks
to two months?

30:00.865 --> 30:02.332
That could be forever in here.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.968
You're talking about suicide.

30:09.407 --> 30:12.376
I appreciate your concern,
Tom, I do.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.368
But really, I'd like you to leave now.

30:15.547 --> 30:16.536
Both of you.

30:16.714 --> 30:19.512
Listen, Diana, believe--
Don't walk away.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.312
The first time I came to these places,
I never wanted to leave.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.354
But I came to realize,
this is not the world.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.189
None of this is real.

30:27.358 --> 30:29.849
Including Maia.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.533
Mommy, push me a little harder.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.033
She's real enough for me.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.574
Oh, she's not coming back, is she?

30:54.752 --> 30:57.084
She's going to die in there.

30:57.655 --> 31:00.021
That seems to be her plan.

31:01.025 --> 31:04.085
I can't help but think this is my fault.
I took her there.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.162
No, don't do that to yourself.

31:06.331 --> 31:07.389
You didn't take Maia away.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.125
The people who did that,
they're to blame.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.329
Maybe.

31:12.837 --> 31:15.032
But these people in the future?

31:15.206 --> 31:18.198
They don't seem to care
who they hurt, do they?

31:18.376 --> 31:20.241
No, they don't.

31:28.853 --> 31:31.845
Four o'clock is fast approaching.
Have you come to a decision?

31:32.023 --> 31:34.617
Do I want to get in bed with a terrorist,
or go to war with one?

31:34.792 --> 31:36.157
That does appear to be the question.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.091
Whatever you decide,
you can count on my support.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.659
Isabelle?

31:42.433 --> 31:43.730
Isabelle?

31:49.574 --> 31:52.668
My relationship with Shawn
has nothing to do with you.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.005
That's not true. I just care
about what happens to you.

31:55.179 --> 31:59.115
You can care about me all you want,
just stay out of my business.

31:59.284 --> 32:00.478
I'm not gonna do that.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.547
Yes, you are.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.091
Isabelle...?

32:33.718 --> 32:35.185
Daddy?

32:38.990 --> 32:40.480
Daddy?

32:41.693 --> 32:43.524
I'm sorry.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.993
I'm sorry.

32:48.499 --> 32:50.057
Okay, move on.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.162
It's all right, baby.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.917
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I've been thinking.

33:12.457 --> 33:16.757
Ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice after another.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.896
You and your daughter.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.089
My son.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.402
It has to stop.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.833
So I have a plan.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.775
I'm not sure it's gonna work.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.447
It might be the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.347
I kind of wish you were here
to stop me.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.911
But you're not,
and I have to try something.

33:46.791 --> 33:50.124
Maybe this is goodbye,
maybe it isn't.

33:58.169 --> 34:00.967
The job wouldn't have been
any fun without you.

34:22.260 --> 34:26.321
Okay, okay. Okay.
This is gonna work, right? Okay.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.277
It worked, right?

34:41.446 --> 34:42.743
I'm not dead.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.313
Not this time, no.

34:44.482 --> 34:47.417
Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.217
The children you took,
Maia and the others.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.481
I want them back.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.851
You were never meant
to remember them.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.152
We went to great lengths
to erase them from your memory

34:57.328 --> 34:59.193
to spare you any pain.

34:59.363 --> 35:00.990
It didn't work.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.690
It appears we underestimated
the bonds they had forged.

35:03.868 --> 35:07.031
It's called "family."
Are you familiar with the concept?

35:07.205 --> 35:10.231
You had no right to take them,
treat people like that.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.571
Maia was only 25 when she died.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.439
Now, either return the children,

35:15.613 --> 35:18.446
or put that rope back around my neck,
because I'm done.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.345
In that case,

35:20.518 --> 35:23.112
I need to show you something.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.871
They're alive.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.977
You forced us to go back,
extract them from the timeline.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.137
But returning them to you
would be a mistake.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.340
For our time, and for yours.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.855
The 4400 were an experiment
we always knew might fail.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.995
There were so many variables.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.926
It was impossible to predict them all.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.066
So you're telling me everything
you've done--

36:09.233 --> 36:13.863
Taking the 4400, sending them back.
--it hasn't changed anything?

36:14.372 --> 36:15.862
The catastrophe's still coming?

36:17.909 --> 36:21.743
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.911
Enemies?

36:24.081 --> 36:27.881
There are those among us who would
prefer history to remain unchanged.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.247
That the 4400 fail in their mission.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.013
You mean they want
humanity to die out?

36:32.190 --> 36:35.091
They are convinced
that they will survive.

36:35.259 --> 36:38.353
Not only survive,
but benefit from the chaos.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.626
If you think we are heartless,

36:40.798 --> 36:44.734
I assure you, that the other side
is unimaginably more brutal.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.360
And they've let loose
a terrible evil into your time.

36:48.539 --> 36:52.031
Sending these children further back
into the timeline

36:52.210 --> 36:54.644
was an attempt to combat that evil.

36:54.812 --> 36:55.972
If we return them to you,

36:56.147 --> 36:58.615
all the good that they have done
in the past will be negated.

36:58.783 --> 37:01.911
The 4400 and everything
that they were meant to achieve

37:02.086 --> 37:03.576
will be in jeopardy.

37:03.754 --> 37:06.314
This evil, there has to be
some other way to deal with it.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.253
There is.

37:10.094 --> 37:13.621
You. You are the other way.

37:13.798 --> 37:16.323
It's a burden that we had hoped
not to place on you.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.560
If you return Maia and the others,
I'll do whatever you want.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.001
What we want,
you may not be willing to give.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.800
Do we have a deal or not?

37:24.208 --> 37:27.609
We do. But it's a deal I'm afraid
you'll come to regret.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.828
Hello?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.469
Hello?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.608
Is there anyone here?

38:31.976 --> 38:33.637
Maia?

38:34.211 --> 38:38.307
- Tom!
- Maia! Maia!

38:40.584 --> 38:43.052
It's okay. He works with my Mom.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.744
- We were kidnapped!
- Where's Sarah?

38:44.922 --> 38:47.322
- Did you catch her?
- Can we go home now?

38:47.491 --> 38:48.890
Yes. Yes, you guys.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.652
- Where's my Mom?
- You're all going home.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.762
It's over. You're all safe now.

38:53.364 --> 38:54.558
Is my Mom here?

38:54.732 --> 38:58.429
She's not here,
but I'll take you to her, okay?

39:16.987 --> 39:18.477
Hello.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.021
Has he arrived yet?

39:24.995 --> 39:27.589
Then he's made my choice for me.

39:44.348 --> 39:47.249
Where are you hiding? Come on!

39:52.523 --> 39:55.083
I know you're watching me.
I know you're listening.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.730
Where are you?

40:17.515 --> 40:20.177
I found you. I found your bug.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.513
I found your stupid little bug.

40:32.229 --> 40:33.856
Okay, sweetie, lights out.

40:34.031 --> 40:35.225
But it's still early.

40:35.399 --> 40:37.924
It's 9:30, and it's time for bed.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.832
Okay, but first I need you
to do something for me.

40:41.005 --> 40:44.441
- Maia, no stalling.
- Mommy, please. It won't take long.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.041
All you have to do is shut your eyes.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.938
All right. Okay.
Well, they're shut. Now what?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.444
Maia?

40:56.620 --> 40:59.817
I'm here, Mommy.
You can open your eyes now.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.987
Mommy?

41:08.098 --> 41:09.122
Wake up.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.527
It's okay.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.660
I'm back.

41:14.839 --> 41:17.034
Everything's fine.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.341
But you have to wake up.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.904
Mommy, please.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.710
Wake up. Please.

41:36.894 --> 41:39.522
Maia? Maia?
