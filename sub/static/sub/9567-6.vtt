03:37.500 --> 03:39.205
Yeah. But she's out of your league.

03:39.245 --> 03:40.263
I mean, yes, but...

03:40.303 --> 03:42.330
But you've only slept with one girl,

03:42.370 --> 03:44.413
and this person was a lesbian
who felt sorry for you.

03:44.423 --> 03:47.015
No! I mean, yes, but...

03:47.055 --> 03:49.868
But you have no hair on your balls.

03:49.908 --> 03:51.584
No... I mean... Yes.

03:51.624 --> 03:54.527
I mean... no,
there's lots of hair on my balls.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.546
I don't think so, cuz. There's none.

03:57.586 --> 03:59.336
What? But... that's...

03:59.376 --> 04:01.666
I do have hairy balls!

04:01.706 --> 04:05.096
There is lots of hair on my balls.
My balls are hairy!

04:05.136 --> 04:08.020
My cock's hairy too!
What do you think of that?

04:12.249 --> 04:16.291
Captain's log.
Experiencing turbulence.

04:16.331 --> 04:20.380
Abnormal cosmic conditions
are generating unforeseen forces.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.836
Strange...

04:23.834 --> 04:26.291
Life form was wearing
really nice earrings today.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.256
Tomorrow...

04:31.828 --> 04:33.557
If she smiles tomorrow...

04:50.493 --> 04:52.563
I have you now, Congo Man.

05:02.377 --> 05:05.641
I could get you deported, you know!
One phone call!

05:05.681 --> 05:07.806
When you've finished
flirting with each other,

05:07.846 --> 05:09.979
the customer toilets
are in a right state.

05:19.316 --> 05:21.364
She smiled at me...

05:28.023 --> 05:29.991
This is your chance.
You must seize it.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.424
Go on, seize it.

05:34.788 --> 05:36.653
Maybe... What's it worth?

05:38.185 --> 05:40.562
Shut up!

05:44.397 --> 05:46.666
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies

05:46.706 --> 05:48.650
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies

05:48.690 --> 05:50.561
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies, yo! #

05:53.135 --> 05:54.202
Poppet not singing?

05:54.242 --> 05:55.441
Poppet not singing?
I don't feel like it.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.858
If the atoms in a container
of helium gas

05:57.898 --> 06:00.304
have the same average speed
as the atoms of...

06:00.344 --> 06:01.353
I don't care...

06:01.393 --> 06:03.201
...a container of argon...

06:03.241 --> 06:04.336
which is hotter?

06:04.376 --> 06:05.320
I don't care.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.050
I don't bloody care!

06:14.194 --> 06:16.001
Edward?

06:16.041 --> 06:17.662
The house is on fire.

06:20.300 --> 06:24.196
Captain's log. Alien life form
defined as Lara Lloyd.

06:24.236 --> 06:28.590
The most beautiful girl
in this or any known universe.

06:28.630 --> 06:31.607
Jonah Jones, a pathetic wanker
who will die alone

06:31.647 --> 06:34.496
in a flat full of pigeons
that he calls his babies.

06:36.468 --> 06:38.495
Mission aborted.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.307
Fuckin' hell, my chest!

07:13.347 --> 07:16.582
Hello.

07:16.622 --> 07:17.378
Hey.

07:23.806 --> 07:25.434
You don't look well, Lara.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.039
It's just a bit of a...

07:27.079 --> 07:29.189
Atchoo! Sorry.

07:34.358 --> 07:37.094
She even makes mucus look good.

07:37.134 --> 07:38.156
C'est vrai.

07:38.196 --> 07:41.535
Atchoo! A-A-Atchoo!

07:51.231 --> 07:53.017
This looks bad, doesn't it?

07:54.621 --> 07:57.027
Vitamin C.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.887
Helps your immune system fight off
colds and flu,

07:59.927 --> 08:01.213
and if you're like me,

08:01.253 --> 08:04.206
it regulates your bowel movements,
which is...

08:04.246 --> 08:06.039
important.

08:06.049 --> 08:07.505
Sweet.

08:28.770 --> 08:31.457
Tasty. Thanks, AJ.

08:31.497 --> 08:32.913
Lara. I...

08:36.044 --> 08:38.344
My name's not AJ. It's JJ.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.313
Oh... right.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.895
Silly me.

08:45.718 --> 08:50.296
If you don't ask her out
in the next ten seconds, I will.

08:50.336 --> 08:52.351
Ten... nine... eight...

08:52.391 --> 08:54.157
seven... six...

08:54.197 --> 08:56.290
Thomas... wait!

08:56.330 --> 08:57.782
...five... four... three...

09:05.445 --> 09:07.771
Lara, have you got a minute?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.750
Get out of my way.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.742
Lara Lloyd, would you like
to go out with me tonight?

09:29.090 --> 09:31.979
Yes, all right.

09:45.623 --> 09:47.013
There has been an unexpected warp

09:47.053 --> 09:52.013
in the space-time continuum.
Operation Lara is go.

09:52.253 --> 09:55.388
Repeat, go.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.676
Repeat, go!

10:11.746 --> 10:12.768
Come!

10:12.808 --> 10:15.495
That's an awful lot of stuff,
Freddie.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.571
Yeah, you know. Revision.

10:17.611 --> 10:19.825
Give me a shout if
you need anything.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.003
Are you gonna fucking
help me here, or what?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.493
Yes, but what's?

10:30.578 --> 10:31.784
Freddie?

10:33.256 --> 10:35.991
Your bag's on fire.

10:36.031 --> 10:38.846
Just open it.

10:42.734 --> 10:45.360
Way-hey! Cook!

10:45.400 --> 10:47.123
Daddy's home, Jaykins.

10:48.611 --> 10:51.023
Now, hands up
who wants to play Anne Frank.

10:56.425 --> 10:58.644
You can't just stay here.

10:58.684 --> 11:02.186
I'm sorry, mate. Fred's dad
was getting suspicious, wasn't he?

11:02.226 --> 11:04.028
You'll have to keep me here
for a bit.

11:04.068 --> 11:06.802
Keep you?
What do you mean, "keep you"?

11:06.842 --> 11:09.325
Her Majesty's Prison Service
is supposed to be doing that!

11:09.365 --> 11:11.862
I escaped, all right?
What's the problem?

11:13.251 --> 11:15.301
I've got a life, Cook!

11:15.341 --> 11:19.367
Oh, I wouldn't want to interrupt your
fucking hectic social whirl, Jaykins.

11:19.407 --> 11:21.650
FYI, things have changed, Cook.

11:21.690 --> 11:23.957
I've got... a job!

11:23.997 --> 11:25.514
And a date!

11:25.554 --> 11:26.913
With a girl.

11:28.071 --> 11:31.759
But this is hopeless. I'm stressed.
I'm gonna fuck up.

11:31.769 --> 11:33.613
And I don't know what I'm doing.

11:33.653 --> 11:36.717
Well, let me make fucking use
of myself, then, Jaykins.

11:36.757 --> 11:38.341
How? What can you?

11:38.381 --> 11:40.533
Listen, three rules...
One, just be cool.

11:40.573 --> 11:42.495
Just "be cool"?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.914
Just "be cool"?
Two, touch her.

11:43.954 --> 11:48.020
Simple creatures, women, right?
Touch her, she knows you want her.

11:48.060 --> 11:50.795
If you don't, she starts to think
she's ugly. Right?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.632
Right. Touch her.

11:52.672 --> 11:55.822
Three, look at her pupils.
If they dilate when you look at her,

11:55.862 --> 11:59.132
it means she actually wants to play
with your ding-a-ling. Capische?

12:00.279 --> 12:04.153
Could you pass us that Ladyshave
there, Jaykins? Good lad.

12:04.193 --> 12:07.429
OK. You need to hide
in my room, hurry up.

12:15.779 --> 12:17.057
What are you doing?

12:17.097 --> 12:18.582
Locking the door!

12:18.622 --> 12:20.964
But I need to clean your room,
you know that.

12:21.004 --> 12:24.796
Yes, but what if I have private
things? Things you can't see?

12:24.836 --> 12:27.531
We don't have secrets, Jonah.

12:27.571 --> 12:28.798
What things?

12:28.838 --> 12:30.413
Porn!

12:31.951 --> 12:35.382
I don't want you to see
my pornography, Mother!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.213
And I know you've been looking.

13:01.358 --> 13:03.149
Let's do this.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.815
OK, changed her mind.

13:11.895 --> 13:12.890
JJ?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.345
You're a little early.

13:17.385 --> 13:18.552
Really?

13:18.592 --> 13:20.873
Yes. Two hours early.

13:23.882 --> 13:26.306
Watch, daylight saving, you know.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.196
Uh! Idiot...

13:28.206 --> 13:30.256
Is it cool to arrive early?

13:30.296 --> 13:31.552
No.

13:31.592 --> 13:33.630
No... No, of course not.

13:33.670 --> 13:35.409
You look amazing.

13:35.449 --> 13:36.615
Thanks.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.844
What are you doing?

13:41.884 --> 13:43.072
Just... touching you.

13:44.518 --> 13:45.681
Soft.

13:45.721 --> 13:47.589
OK, shall we cut to the chase?

13:47.629 --> 13:49.172
Possibly.

13:49.212 --> 13:51.820
Your eyes... Can I just check?

13:51.860 --> 13:55.088
Why don't you come inside? I just
wanted to show you something.

13:55.128 --> 13:57.215
Inside, you know?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.518
Over here.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.730
JJ, I'd like you to meet someone.

14:19.770 --> 14:22.381
This is Albert... my baby.

14:29.216 --> 14:32.195
Your... baby. As in?

14:32.235 --> 14:35.272
As in, yes, I had sex, and shazam!

14:35.312 --> 14:36.943
Baby.

14:36.983 --> 14:37.989
Baby.

14:38.029 --> 14:40.573
Baby.
Baby, that's right.

14:40.613 --> 14:46.000
Um, maybe you could watch him
for five minutes, just while I get ready?

14:48.570 --> 14:49.620
No problemo.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.565
No problemo.
Cool.

15:04.149 --> 15:05.739
Hey?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.271
So...

15:08.311 --> 15:11.452
there's nothing in my left hand.

15:11.492 --> 15:13.846
There's nothing in my right hand.

15:25.545 --> 15:28.605
Oh, you like that, do you?

15:30.315 --> 15:32.875
What's going on?

15:33.960 --> 15:37.270
Tell you what, Albert,
let's see what else we can find.

15:40.467 --> 15:42.354
What's this behind your ear?

15:42.394 --> 15:44.056
A pound!

15:44.096 --> 15:45.932
Five pounds! Ten pounds!

15:45.972 --> 15:47.828
What are you, made of money?!

15:50.033 --> 15:54.111
I don't mean to be rude, Albert,
but you kind of stink.

15:55.721 --> 15:56.801
Do I?

16:01.011 --> 16:04.911
Oh, Jiminy Cricket,
that is disgusting!

16:04.951 --> 16:07.819
Oh, no. No! No!

16:07.859 --> 16:10.343
I forbid you to do that! Oh!

16:10.383 --> 16:13.019
Help! Help! Lara!

16:13.059 --> 16:15.281
It's all gone tits up in here.

16:16.353 --> 16:17.347
Argh!
Who the fuck are you?

16:17.387 --> 16:19.171
I'm Jonah Jeremiah Jones,
and he wee'd in my mouth!

16:19.211 --> 16:21.893
Who said you could touch
my fucking baby?

16:21.933 --> 16:24.084
Nobody, nobody,
but there's a lot of poo.

16:24.124 --> 16:25.574
I'm telling you. A lot!

16:26.861 --> 16:29.909
JJ, this is Liam, Albert's dad.

16:29.949 --> 16:32.544
He baby-sits for me sometimes...
if he's good.

16:32.584 --> 16:34.953
Right, Liam?

16:34.993 --> 16:36.090
Yeah, right.

16:36.130 --> 16:37.549
Yeah, right.
I'm ready for our date, JJ.

16:37.589 --> 16:40.336
Change the baby, Liam.
Would you mind?

16:42.138 --> 16:43.571
Coming?

16:45.565 --> 16:47.316
I see you touch my kid again,

16:47.356 --> 16:49.045
I'm gonna rip your lungs out.

16:50.141 --> 16:51.935
Touch her...

16:51.975 --> 16:55.232
and I'll set them on fire
and shove them up your arse.

17:00.008 --> 17:03.512
Atta boy. Coochie-coo!

17:09.422 --> 17:11.442
So, this is nice.

17:11.482 --> 17:14.617
Yes. Yes. It's so lovely.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.125
And you're...

17:17.165 --> 17:20.565
I see you like peanuts, even though the
average bar snack does test positive

17:20.605 --> 17:22.839
for the urine of
up to 16 different people.

17:24.278 --> 17:27.429
Let's get this party started,
shall we? Garcon!

17:29.995 --> 17:34.358
I'd like a Capribena, straight up,
on the rocks, with a twist

17:34.398 --> 17:36.288
What the fuck's a Capribena?

17:36.328 --> 17:39.202
It's a Capri Sun and Ribena cocktail.
That's how I roll.

17:39.242 --> 17:42.324
We haven't got any Ribena...
or Capri Sun.

17:42.364 --> 17:44.790
OK.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.559
Water, tap, hold the ice.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.517
Lady? I mean Lara?

17:49.557 --> 17:51.124
Vodka and Coke.

17:51.164 --> 17:54.514
You heard the Lara. Vodka and cock.
I mean Coke.

17:57.096 --> 18:00.727
Personally, I find vodka
weakens the neck of my bladder,

18:00.767 --> 18:02.103
but each to his... Emily?

18:06.121 --> 18:08.656
Hi, JJ. Who's this?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.791
Hi, Emily. This is...

18:10.831 --> 18:13.875
well, what are you?

18:13.915 --> 18:15.918
I'm your friend, JJ.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.739
Yes, this is my friend, Lara.

18:20.737 --> 18:22.099
Right.

18:22.139 --> 18:25.445
Um... this is my friend, Mandy.

18:25.485 --> 18:26.902
We were just leaving.

18:26.912 --> 18:28.220
We were just leaving.
We just got here.

18:32.824 --> 18:35.292
See you, JJ. Nice meeting you, Lara.

18:38.936 --> 18:40.221
She's lovely, isn't she?

18:41.572 --> 18:42.993
Funny...

18:43.033 --> 18:44.274
Funny...
What?

18:44.314 --> 18:46.259
Oh, nothing.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.068
Now, where were we?

18:50.715 --> 18:52.104
JJ.

18:52.114 --> 18:53.257
Yes?

18:53.297 --> 18:54.514
You're touching me.

18:54.554 --> 18:56.232
That's right.

18:57.515 --> 19:01.533
Tell you what. Let's keep our hands
where we can see them for now, yeah?

19:01.573 --> 19:02.596
You cool with that?

19:02.636 --> 19:04.126
You cool with that?
Oh, yes. I am.

19:04.166 --> 19:08.529
Um... So you and Liam
are definitely not...

19:08.569 --> 19:10.621
Would I be sitting here
with you if I were?

19:10.661 --> 19:13.021
Of course not. Obviously.

19:16.173 --> 19:18.098
Are your pupils usually so dilated?

19:18.138 --> 19:19.635
Only when I'm pissed off.

19:19.675 --> 19:22.052
Only when I'm pissed off.
Right, OK. Yup.

19:22.092 --> 19:23.940
Er... cheers.

19:28.350 --> 19:30.545
Wrong drink!
That's gone straight through me!

19:33.965 --> 19:35.628
She's got a baby.

19:35.638 --> 19:37.224
'Shit the bed! '

19:37.264 --> 19:39.007
Are her baps all shonky, then?

19:39.047 --> 19:41.627
'I don't know and I probably never
will! Oh, and by the way,'

19:41.667 --> 19:44.419
her ex-boyfriend
wants to shove my lungs up my arse.

19:44.459 --> 19:47.238
On fire. What the hell do I do?

19:47.278 --> 19:49.722
Get out of there, J.
Abort mission, mate.

19:49.762 --> 19:51.102
Abort mission.

19:51.142 --> 19:53.251
Yes. Abort.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.422
Yes.

20:02.032 --> 20:04.218
Do you need a hand?

20:04.258 --> 20:06.174
No, I'm fine. I just...

20:08.412 --> 20:10.961
Oi! What are you doing in here?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.804
This is the ladies'.

20:15.975 --> 20:18.822
Yeah. Yes, obviously.

20:18.862 --> 20:21.175
I just came in to...

20:21.215 --> 20:22.756
buy tampons.

20:23.836 --> 20:25.234
For you.

20:25.274 --> 20:26.758
As a gift.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.779
Forget it. This was a mistake.

20:32.819 --> 20:33.821
Forget it. This was a mistake.
No.

20:33.861 --> 20:35.995
No... I'm the mistake!

20:36.035 --> 20:38.749
I'm the mistake, it's me!

20:38.789 --> 20:40.205
I'm a mistake.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.625
I really like you.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.378
Funny way of showing it.

21:18.388 --> 21:19.935
Yeah.

21:21.894 --> 21:23.707
This isn't going to work, is it?

21:23.747 --> 21:28.059
I mean, you're a ten
and I'm a three.

21:28.099 --> 21:30.103
I'm a bit funnyy.

21:30.143 --> 21:32.403
There it is.

21:32.443 --> 21:36.451
You should be with somebody
less reliant on their mother.

21:36.491 --> 21:38.593
Somebody with pecs

21:38.633 --> 21:40.621
and guns...

21:40.661 --> 21:42.031
Someone like Liam.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.069
Liam doesn't flirt with old ladies.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.858
O... K.

21:53.383 --> 21:55.776
You flirt with old ladies.

21:55.816 --> 22:00.418
At work, you call them signorina and
tell them their lipstick looks nice.

22:02.057 --> 22:03.742
And you're nice. Just...

22:03.752 --> 22:06.209
will you stop trying so hard?

22:07.256 --> 22:08.712
Yeah?

22:09.988 --> 22:11.057
You're nice.

23:38.571 --> 23:40.810
Where the fucking hell
have you been?!

23:40.850 --> 23:44.271
Sorry?
Time flies when you're having fun.

23:44.311 --> 23:46.808
You've been gone for two days.
I've been drinking piss!

23:48.663 --> 23:50.283
Whose piss?

23:50.323 --> 23:51.292
Whose piss?
Mine!

23:51.332 --> 23:54.978
Fucking hell! Does no-one turn down
the central heating in here? Jesus!

23:56.036 --> 23:57.379
Savoury pork pie?

24:00.810 --> 24:03.344
You need to make this up to me.

24:03.384 --> 24:05.079
I'm serious.

24:05.119 --> 24:07.129
I want Chinese food - a lot of it.

24:07.169 --> 24:10.024
I texted Freddie, he's coming over.
You and him sneak me out...

24:10.064 --> 24:12.354
Can't. Me and Lara have got plans.

24:12.394 --> 24:13.994
"Me and fucking Lara"!

24:14.004 --> 24:16.818
Where's the love, J? Hm?
Where's the love!?

24:16.858 --> 24:18.605
Can't you just be happy for me?

24:18.615 --> 24:21.529
I am happy for ya,
but it ain't gonna last, is it?

24:21.569 --> 24:22.785
Why not?

24:22.825 --> 24:25.113
Cos women are a mystery
to us with even normal brains.

24:25.153 --> 24:27.454
Your special noggin
does not stand a chance.

24:27.494 --> 24:30.729
Fuck! And I need you to sneak me
into your shitter, J.

24:30.769 --> 24:34.269
Cos I'm tellin' you, man, I've been
waiting three days to drop my load.

24:34.309 --> 24:36.644
That's how much I care.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.578
OK?

24:48.719 --> 24:50.695
I haven't said anything.

24:50.935 --> 24:52.456
No.

24:52.496 --> 24:55.295
So... why are you writing?

24:55.335 --> 24:57.980
Oh, it's... it's what we do.

25:00.149 --> 25:01.427
You're worrying.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.199
Yes.

25:03.239 --> 25:04.894
Just don't do that.

25:06.297 --> 25:07.859
Actually, I'm worrying, Dr. Felly.

25:07.899 --> 25:08.884
Really?

25:08.924 --> 25:10.504
I just don't know what to do.

25:10.544 --> 25:15.295
He's eating more and he's secretive
and he's looking at pornography.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.735
Oh, you mustn't do that, JJ.

25:17.775 --> 25:20.376
I mean, maybe if he had
a real girlfriend, then...
