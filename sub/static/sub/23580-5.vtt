00:02.000 --> 00:03.719
Carys! Carys!

00:03.719 --> 00:06.119
My mum killed herself and I think
that it has something to do

00:06.120 --> 00:10.320
with your daughter, Carys. 23 years
gone and you lot are still at it.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.919
You're my mother!
And I'm your daughter!

00:13.920 --> 00:15.439
I don't want you.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.879
What have you done to her?
Aron. What have you done?

00:18.880 --> 00:20.639
Dad? What's happened?

00:20.640 --> 00:23.039
Let's keep this our secret.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.080
If only Matilda could
remember something.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.919
Like who took her.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.479
He gazed into a mirror,
a black mirror.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.759
He thought he was talking to angels.

00:32.759 --> 00:36.919
I feel like there's something in me,
scared of what I'm going to see.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.239
You can't look away.
And keep watching the mirror.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.439
No matter what, I'll be right here.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.279
That's what the voice said.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.360
She's trapped in a field
of yellow flowers.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.079
Which brings me to my next guest,

01:36.080 --> 01:40.239
a young cellist who's received rave
reviews for her debut recording,

01:40.240 --> 01:44.879
and has already sold out her season
at the Royal Elizabeth Hall,

01:44.880 --> 01:46.199
Matilda Gray.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.639
Welcome. It's great to be here.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.679
Some cynics may see this as a cycle.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.599
Every few years, we see
a young, glamorous musician

01:54.600 --> 01:59.479
held up as a saviour who's going to
make classical music relevant again.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.479
Honestly, I'm just a cellist and
I don't do this to sell tickets.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.960
So why do you do it?

02:06.080 --> 02:09.039
Because my music, it's in me
and it has to get out.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.360
It's me.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.200
I've found her.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.080
Tilly?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.319
Sorry, what?

03:52.320 --> 03:54.440
He's here, and he's brought someone.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.720
David. David, hi.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.439
Sorry, David's my godson.
He's staying with me at the moment.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.759
No, it's fine, he's fine.
He's welcome here, right?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.159
Sure thing.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.519
I've got a new game on my computer

04:14.520 --> 04:17.079
and I'm having a bit of
trouble beating it.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.159
Do you want to help me out?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.320
Matilda? Shall we?

04:24.760 --> 04:27.960
Carys, in a field of yellow flowers,
just like Laura said.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.800
Any child could have done this.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.799
What, that?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.959
Carys was here in this room
when she drew this.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.039
You need to show these to Graves.
Matilda, listen.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.039
You need to get her to
reopen the investigation.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.199
I'm not dismissing you.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.639
But I know how the police work,
and we're going to need more,

04:44.640 --> 04:46.759
something that links
these drawings with Carys.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.399
These were hers, all right?
I just, I just know they are.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.719
We can't ask Rose.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.999
If Sean Howell is around,
like you say,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.359
he might be able to identify it
as his daughter's.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.039
I can't find him.
He said he had a campsite.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.759
Yeah, I can't find that either.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.319
I was looking for it this
morning and I can't find it.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.159
I've got a mate, high up in Cardiff.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.519
I'll send them your photos.
If I can get him interested,

05:09.520 --> 05:11.719
he might recommend a review.
How long will that take?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.239
I'll push as hard as I can.
How long?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.519
Matilda, I'm on your side
but you have to understand,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.240
a 23yearold case, whatever I do...

05:18.520 --> 05:20.080
it's not going to be priority.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.040
So?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.680
Dead end?

05:41.680 --> 05:43.600
I thought you said
you were flying home?

05:45.560 --> 05:46.800
Got delayed.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.000
Look, I'm sensing
some hostility here.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.640
I've got to go.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.800
The reason we decided to put the
show on in the boxing gym is...

06:01.720 --> 06:03.440
My first guest...

06:35.720 --> 06:37.479
I've just put the kettle on.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.519
Everything that Bessie
said about Carys was true.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.040
I've seen it with my own eyes.
I want her to tell me more.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.600
That was just my illness.
It's not an illness, it's real.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.480
Well, I, I don't get
those voices any more.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.440
I'm better now.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.240
Laura.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.159
There's something up
at the old house.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.239
Angels or spirits or...
I don't know what they are.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.319
But I saw one last night,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.039
and it was trying to
tell me something,

07:17.040 --> 07:19.560
but I couldn't understand,
but I think maybe you can.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.760
Please? I'm so close to an answer.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.879
What do you want me to do?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.480
When do you take those?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.840
I was supposed to
take them an hour ago, I...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.600
Let Bessie come back.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.319
What? Is that your
favourite piece of music?

07:50.320 --> 07:52.959
You asked me what I like, you
didn't say what's my favourite.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.640
OK, I'm asking now, then. Erm...

07:58.720 --> 08:03.040
Blues. Probably. Yeah?
Billie Holiday.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.080
Yeah. Yeah. You? It's too many.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.159
That's Halspeak for "You probably
haven't heard of any of them."

08:12.160 --> 08:13.720
Hey, you probably haven't!

08:17.240 --> 08:20.120
I've been thinking, maybe I've
been too obsessed with classical.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.280
Might be time for something new.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.799
Wh...? Um...

08:30.800 --> 08:33.280
OK.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.239
Hal? It's Kath, Janice's friend.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.519
I got your number
from Matilda's agent.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.119
Hey, Kath, how can I help you?
Well, is Matilda there?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.799
No, she's not here at the moment.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.919
I wanted to check that she'd
received her birth certificate.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.719
I haven't heard from her and I was
starting to get worried, so, well,

08:50.720 --> 08:53.839
I thought it's best I try and
get hold of her through you.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.639
Her birth, her birth certificate?
So, you found it?

08:56.640 --> 08:59.159
Yeah, and I sent it to her
a couple of days ago,

08:59.160 --> 09:00.999
but I've not heard back.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.519
I know she needed it urgently
for the job in the States.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.919
Yeah, do you know what?

09:04.920 --> 09:08.039
She's been having a really
bad run of her phone.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.239
Could you send it again,
but send it to me this time?

09:10.240 --> 09:12.439
You're a darling.
I'm doing it right now.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.520
Yeah, OK. I'll make sure that
she gets it, goodbye. Bye.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.200
Everything OK?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.000
Erm, yeah, it's fine.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.040
It's... I need to run.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.560
OK. So, erm...

09:41.920 --> 09:43.240
See you.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.920
Something terrible happened in here.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.400
To Carys?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.120
I don't know.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.480
Lloyd said that I should give you
something that belonged to her.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.320
No, that wasn't hers.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.199
What does Bessie say?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.280
I don't know. She's whispering.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.360
No! God!

11:37.360 --> 11:38.759
What is it?

11:38.760 --> 11:42.719
She was kept in that room,
locked up while they waited.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.440
Who? Who locked her up?

11:48.120 --> 11:49.720
He died in there.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
Alone. He?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.919
Who are you talking about?

11:54.920 --> 11:57.999
Look. What you saw...

11:58.000 --> 12:01.119
They're not the danger.
You mean the angels? The angels.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.399
There's something else, erm, yeah.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.759
The moon'll be full tomorrow
and then, they'll be ready.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.360
What will be ready?

12:13.760 --> 12:15.200
I...

12:18.800 --> 12:22.240
No. No.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.800
This... It's gone.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.080
She'll tell me tonight.
Best to be stronger then.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.439
Nick? Hi, come in.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.679
How's it going? Yeah, I'm
looking for Matilda, is she...?

12:49.680 --> 12:51.520
Um, inside with her friend.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.640
What the hell?

13:02.000 --> 13:06.520
I asked if she wanted to keep it
and she said, "Get it out," so...

13:16.600 --> 13:18.360
Bessie, you like it too?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.120
You and me, we'll both..
What's going on?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.519
Erm...

13:28.520 --> 13:30.399
That's Laura.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.359
I told you about her. The psychic.
She knows what happened here.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.239
And what would that be?

13:36.240 --> 13:38.599
Hal, I've been reading
more about John Dee

13:38.600 --> 13:42.639
and he wasn't just trying to
talk to angels,

13:42.640 --> 13:44.840
he was trying to summon them.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.719
Control them. Jesus Christ.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.600
And I think someone
is still doing it.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.280
And bringing them here.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.760
I've seen them.
And Laura sensed them.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.320
And your cello?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.920
Is that with the angels?

14:09.400 --> 14:12.199
Don't want to talk about that.
You don't want to talk about that?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.920
Do you want to talk about this?

14:17.360 --> 14:19.440
Kath said she sent it to you
on Monday.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.520
When were you going to tell me?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.560
It's fake. It's what?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.959
It's a fake, it must be.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.479
So, it says the name of a
real hospital, a real doctor,

14:36.480 --> 14:38.999
a real mother and father,
your father, by the way.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.680
No, that's not me, that's not me.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.279
I know who I am. Yes.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.599
Matilda Joanne Gray, born
April 25, 1990, Manchester,

14:48.600 --> 14:51.519
daughter to Ronald Gray,
army engineer.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.079
No! Mother, Janice Gray.
Why are you doing this?

14:54.080 --> 14:55.399
You, me, us,

14:55.400 --> 14:58.039
we have been nothing short of
a disaster for this community.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.399
We came here because you wanted to.
For you!

15:01.400 --> 15:04.079
I dropped everything
and came here for you.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.599
Like, everything I've done
since the first time I saw you,

15:06.600 --> 15:09.800
every single thing I've
done has been to please you.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.760
And you know...

15:21.040 --> 15:22.320
You know.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.120
Hal.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.640
I feel like I'm coming apart.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.199
I thought that I was
figuring out who I am.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
The more that I dig, it's like...

15:41.200 --> 15:45.480
It's like I'm unravelling,
it's like there's a hole in me.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.360
Then stop it.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.919
Stop it all. I can't, I can't!
I need to know...

15:53.920 --> 15:56.239
No, you don't. People
are being hurt, by you,

15:56.240 --> 15:58.719
there's a woman in hospital.
That's not my fault!

15:58.720 --> 16:00.559
Then whose fault is it?

16:00.560 --> 16:03.959
I mean, bloody hell,
we pushed a woman to suicide.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.399
Is it really worth that?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.639
I know what you want, you just
want me back on my cello,

16:07.640 --> 16:09.479
so you can carry on
riding on my coattails.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.359
Well, I'm not going back, and
I'm not performing any more.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.520
So you can just go back and
find someone else to carry you!

16:23.520 --> 16:25.200
Fine, fine.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.720
If you won't stop this, I will.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.599
Message, boss, Croxford Assizes.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.159
Aron Morgan? Bail granted.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.959
Magistrate said first offence,
sole carer for his son.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.199
He should be heading home right now.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.920
Good news for the young kid.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.280
You all right, boss?

17:01.520 --> 17:05.200
Yeah, I need to go out.
But you just got back.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.040
Is that...? It's a beauty.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.800
You want to be
careful with that.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.040
It's old, you know?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.640
Valuable.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.399
That Laura,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.559
maybe someone ought
to be watching her.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.639
You said it was OK, her coming here.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.439
Yeah, I did.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.680
Look, if I've done something
to piss you off...

18:01.400 --> 18:04.759
can you let me know? Cos
this vibe here is killing me.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.000
If you want this vibe to improve,
maybe start telling me the truth.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.280
I know you lied to me.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.960
You're right.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.879
I don't know no wine bar.
I don't give a shit about that.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.679
Sorry, you said
I was lying and so...

18:30.680 --> 18:32.999
I'm talking about the night
that I blacked out.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.359
Sylvia was here.
She did something to me.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.799
She drugged me or...
Wait, wait, Sylvia?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.679
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.079
I just know that you told me
that nothing happened,

18:43.080 --> 18:44.519
and then I woke up in your bed.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.439
But hang on, what
I told you is true.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.839
That night, I was in my room,
I was asleep.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.999
You came in, you were
upset, freaking out.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.280
She was here the other day,
hanging out with you.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.719
We were talking about...

18:56.720 --> 19:00.439
selling some of the old books
and antiques in the house.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.479
But listen, if you think that
she's done something to you,

19:03.480 --> 19:05.559
I will tell her to piss off, like,

19:05.560 --> 19:07.680
she never comes back
to this house again.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.080
OK?

19:14.360 --> 19:16.040
I don't know what to believe.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Stop looking at me.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.440
I can't just turn it
on and off, you know.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.359
Maybe we should go up to
the room with the pictures,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.119
or down to the basement.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.480
Here or there, best
you talk when she's ready.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.400
You know she's calling you.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.080
It's a nice bit of real estate,
this, isn't it?

20:26.680 --> 20:29.519
Everyone says old man Dean
was a good sort.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.199
Look at all this.
You sell one of these vases,

20:33.200 --> 20:35.000
you could pay my rent for a year.

20:36.520 --> 20:40.240
How can you call someone generous
when they hoard all this lot away?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.839
Do you know what, I'm going
to have one of them as well.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.439
Good idea. Do you want
some ice with that?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.439
Hey! What did you just do with that?

20:48.440 --> 20:51.359
What? That thing you were holding,
you pocketed it.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.919
Nick! No, you did, I saw you.
Let go...

20:53.920 --> 20:56.560
No, she's a bloody junkie
and she's stealing my...

21:01.080 --> 21:02.799
What do we do? Help me.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.999
Shall we stop her, like,
swallowing her tongue?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.280
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

21:12.960 --> 21:17.360
What are you doing? Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

21:24.280 --> 21:27.400
I'm calling an ambulance.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.520
Nick, don't, no, she's all right.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.560
You're OK.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.280
OK now.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.880
I'm perfectly capable
of taking her home.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.239
I think it's better if you don't.
I didn't mean Laura any harm.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.120
But still, you've done her harm.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.399
Good night, Matilda.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.800
Please don't contact Laura again.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.240
Follow me. That's it...

24:09.240 --> 24:10.719
This is PC Graves.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.919
I'm at the rear of Dean House,
over the stream on Weatherhill Lane,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.400
requesting urgent backup.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.640
Aron!

24:33.120 --> 24:35.480
Aron! Are you all right?

24:38.280 --> 24:41.480
Shit. You're done, Ed!
Give up, it'll be easier.

25:45.560 --> 25:51.760
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

25:54.880 --> 25:56.719
Pwll Halen, Pwll Hal...

25:56.720 --> 26:01.079
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

26:01.080 --> 26:06.279
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

26:06.280 --> 26:10.400
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen...

26:26.440 --> 26:29.160
Here you go, still warm
from the dryer. Thank you.

26:32.280 --> 26:37.079
So, this fella you're
looking for in Manchester,

26:37.080 --> 26:39.439
the one called Gray,

26:39.440 --> 26:42.039
how do you know he'll
still be there? I don't.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.079
But he was in the Queen's Engineers
and there's a base at Sale,

26:45.080 --> 26:46.880
so I need to go to Manchester.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.439
And Matilda can't do it
herself, because...?

26:51.440 --> 26:52.760
It's complicated.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.519
I never thought anything
would change in this place,

27:00.520 --> 27:02.280
but you two coming here...

27:03.760 --> 27:05.839
Well, it feels like a new start.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.720
For me, at least.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.759
OK, let's get you
to the train, then.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.680
Actually, I need
to tell you something.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.799
You're married? No.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.600
Girlfriend? No!

27:29.280 --> 27:31.320
Matilda's mum had a box of photos.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.759
Really?

27:34.760 --> 27:36.200
Your dad was in them.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.720
That's Rose. Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.799
Yeah, there's more,
there's a sequence.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.239
First they're shouting,

27:51.240 --> 27:54.720
then she tries to walk away
and he has his arms around her.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.759
Matilda thought Rose
was hiding something.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.320
Maybe it's not about Carys,
maybe it was just about...

28:04.280 --> 28:05.480
this.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.960
When this photo was taken,
my mother was dying.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.279
Slowly.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.920
And now you're telling me
that my dad...

28:22.240 --> 28:24.039
was screwing Rose Howell?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.400
I'm not, I...

28:27.160 --> 28:30.039
I wasn't even sure whether
to show you the photo.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.839
But I care about you so much. No.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.680
Get yourself to the bloody station.
Trudy...

28:40.680 --> 28:44.520
Curing shed. All the highgrade
hydroponic crop ready to go.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.319
My guess is they were
taking it out for sale.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.880
To who? Usual suspects.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.039
Well, apparently, Morgan's
keeping his mouth shut.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.480
Eddie'll spill.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.200
We just need to find him.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.160
We had a lot of good times.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.960
I need to ask you something.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.200
That day.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.760
With Carys.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.320
Mum was...

29:22.520 --> 29:25.799
crying on the stairs
and when you came home,

29:25.800 --> 29:28.000
you didn't even want
to know what was wrong.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.800
All you wanted to do
was wash your clothes.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.000
It was a long time ago.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.480
I remember every single
thing about that day.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.239
There could have been
a million reasons.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.039
I could have been
dirty from the cellar.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.000
So, why did you ask me
to keep it a secret?

29:53.720 --> 29:56.120
We should talk about this later.
About you and Rose?

29:57.440 --> 29:59.879
Is that lad from London
feeding you this?

29:59.880 --> 30:01.959
At the play park,
Mum went to call someone.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.359
She left me with Carys.
It was you she called, wasn't it?

30:04.360 --> 30:05.640
No. Rose, then.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.560
I never thought we
lied to each other.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.080
We fought, yeah, but we never lied.

30:14.680 --> 30:19.160
Love, this is 20 years past.
Not for me!

30:20.360 --> 30:21.920
It's not for me!

30:23.400 --> 30:26.559
Mum got worse again
and then she died,

30:26.560 --> 30:30.359
and I have always thought
that I did that by losing Carys,

30:30.360 --> 30:33.559
that I did that to her,
and all this time,

30:33.560 --> 30:35.959
you have let me think that
when really it was you,

30:35.960 --> 30:39.000
it was you who pushed her
over the edge, all you!

31:02.760 --> 31:04.120
Trudy?

31:05.400 --> 31:07.359
Are you all right?

31:07.360 --> 31:09.000
Yeah, I'm just a bit...

31:10.160 --> 31:11.520
A bit dizzy.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.400
I'm sorry.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.760
I was hoping that you could
help me with something.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.440
Pwll Halen, Pwll Halen,
Pwll Halen...

31:27.960 --> 31:29.320
Well, it's Welsh.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.520
"Pwll halen". Salt pool.

31:34.840 --> 31:38.360
Is there a salt...
A saltwater pool near here? No.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.680
But Pwll Halen's the
name of a caravan site.

31:44.040 --> 31:47.559
It's a local hippie hangout,
it's a short drive from here.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.560
Can you show me? Yeah.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.399
There's a formal procedure

31:56.400 --> 31:58.799
for requesting a
relative's service record.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.200
I can see that.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.639
It's just I've driven all the way
from London to Manchester

32:06.640 --> 32:09.079
and this project, tracking down
the extended family,

32:09.080 --> 32:11.279
is actually my gran's dream.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.799
She's 87.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.759
Well, we can't hand out details
about current personnel,

32:15.760 --> 32:18.119
but I'll tell you
there's no Ronald Gray

32:18.120 --> 32:19.839
presently stationed here.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.079
Would you be able to check
whether he was here?

32:22.080 --> 32:23.799
Maybe in the '90s?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.479
Look, my gran really isn't well.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.000
She hasn't got much time left.

32:29.160 --> 32:34.079
Celia, this gentleman's looking
for a relative, a Sgt Ronald Gray.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.359
Do you remember anyone
by that name stationed here,

32:36.360 --> 32:37.800
maybe back in the '90s?

32:39.360 --> 32:41.720
Well, there was a Ron Gray.

32:43.080 --> 32:47.159
But he's dead, love.
Must be 25 years since...

32:47.160 --> 32:49.959
Dead how? Car accident.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.840
Happened just as I started here.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.600
Horrible thing. And would you know
if his family stayed in the area?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.679
They were killed too, I think.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.719
Wife and young daughter.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.800
And sorry, would you know the names?

33:06.080 --> 33:07.280
No idea.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.919
Mind, you could find out
easy enough.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.320
It was in all the papers.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.920
Thank you.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.840
Jesus.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.960
I think I'm going to puke.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.679
I can drive. No, no,
it's just these potholes.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.080
Over there.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.359
Welcome to the lovely Pwll Halen,

33:36.360 --> 33:39.319
for all your tiedye
and incense needs.

33:39.320 --> 33:42.599
I'm just going to stay here
and let my stomach settle.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.000
See you in a minute.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.518
Hi, this is Matilda Gray.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.639
Leave a message and I will get
back to you as soon as I can.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.279
Tilly, I know you're angry with me,

34:29.280 --> 34:31.360
but I've dug up
some stuff about your dad.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.360
Just call me as soon
as you can, it's important.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.918
So...

34:45.920 --> 34:47.679
What are we looking for?

35:10.320 --> 35:11.720
That.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.680
Hello. Is this yours?

35:24.680 --> 35:26.480
No one will talk to you, you know.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.280
They think you're police.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.280
That symbol.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.280
I wanted to ask you about it.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.800
I'll put the kettle on.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.520
So, is this about the child?

35:59.120 --> 36:00.720
What child?

36:03.840 --> 36:06.080
I'm trying to find out
about Carys Howell.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.200
The girl who went missing
from Penllynith.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.160
That symbol on your bus...

36:14.000 --> 36:16.680
The more I look, the more
it keeps cropping up.

36:19.600 --> 36:25.399
I've been here 20 years,
since the slate works finished.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.240
Always had a few traps
in the woods...

36:28.440 --> 36:29.920
to make ends meet.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.479
One time, I was out,

36:35.480 --> 36:37.240
checking 'em and, er...

36:38.880 --> 36:40.520
the dog found something.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.520
Bones.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.880
A child's bones.

36:49.320 --> 36:53.399
As soon as I found 'em,
I called the police, two came by,

36:53.400 --> 36:56.160
Penllynith coppers, put 'em
in a bag, took 'em away...

36:57.440 --> 36:59.640
and told me it was a sheep.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.840
How do you know it wasn't?

37:05.120 --> 37:08.960
Have you ever seen
a child's skeleton?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.280
No.

37:14.040 --> 37:18.799
Anyhow, there was a
bracelet on the wrist.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.640
Ever heard of a sheep
wearing a bracelet?

37:24.040 --> 37:28.120
The bracelet had that symbol
on the side of my bus.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.920
I've never been able to...

37:33.280 --> 37:34.640
get it out of my head.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.120
And when was this?

37:38.400 --> 37:41.120
About three years after...

37:42.800 --> 37:45.560
young Carys disappeared.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.400
You're saying Carys is dead?

37:54.720 --> 37:57.280
They searched everywhere
for that little girl.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.800
I was like everyone else,
I thought she had just vanished...

38:08.800 --> 38:10.240
until that day.

38:17.560 --> 38:21.120
I come here when I can.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.200
To remember.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.840
I feel like someone ought to.

38:29.040 --> 38:34.079
And you never said anything?
To anyone? All these years?

38:34.080 --> 38:37.000
The cops told me
to shut up about it.

38:38.680 --> 38:43.680
I was on a suspended sentence
for burglary, so, er...

38:45.040 --> 38:47.480
when the law tells you
to shut up, you...

38:48.600 --> 38:50.040
You shut up.

38:53.240 --> 38:57.280
The police who came out here,
do you remember their names? No.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.880
One uniform, one plainclothes.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.400
A detective, I figured.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.120
I, erm...

39:12.560 --> 39:14.360
I buy her flowers when I can.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.440
Would you have...

39:19.200 --> 39:20.640
a few pounds to spare?

39:25.520 --> 39:27.720
God bless you.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.519
Guardian, Manchester Post,
Manchester Chronicle.

39:34.520 --> 39:38.040
September 17th and a few days after.
OK, thank you.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.680
Need anything else, let me know.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.360
Janice.

40:56.920 --> 41:00.399
Kendrick! Hey.
I was going to call you.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.719
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?

41:02.720 --> 41:05.639
Went out to Pwll Halen, heard
about the body, the child's body,

41:05.640 --> 41:08.239
covered up by the local police.
Is that right?

41:08.240 --> 41:11.119
Spoke to a witness, the police
came down to his caravan,

41:11.120 --> 41:14.279
back when you were in charge,
and took the body away.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.879
Told him it was a sheep.
Stan. His name, wasn't it?

41:17.880 --> 41:20.400
Yeah, you know him?
When a child goes missing...

41:21.800 --> 41:23.759
all the crazies
come out of the woodwork.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.119
Our Stan, he was one
of the most persistent.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.959
I haven't heard of him
since I retired.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.799
Seems he's still going, then.
He showed me the grave!

41:31.800 --> 41:35.079
Yeah, and he asked you for a
few quid to put flowers on it.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.639
Am I right?

41:36.640 --> 41:39.440
I can't believe a bright girl
like you would fall for that.

41:42.160 --> 41:45.039
And I was going to tell you
that I sent your photographs off

41:45.040 --> 41:47.959
to my mate in Cardiff and he
promised to look at them

41:47.960 --> 41:49.559
as soon as he could.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.639
You probably don't
want any more dealings

41:51.640 --> 41:53.280
with a bent old copper like me.

42:05.840 --> 42:08.079
Hi, this is Matilda Gray,

42:08.080 --> 42:11.039
leave a message and I will get
back to you as soon as I can.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.480
Jesus, Matilda!

42:55.600 --> 42:57.440
Tru? Jesus!

42:59.440 --> 43:02.639
You scared me.
I'm in trouble, Tru.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.679
Big trouble. What happened?

43:04.680 --> 43:07.439
It wasn't my idea, I swear.
Just tell me what's happened.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.960
Behind the big house.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.720
We were growing weed.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.319
I knew we should have stopped
when the old man died,

43:15.320 --> 43:18.240
but now Graves has found it.
Ed! Ed.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.440
How much weed?

43:22.960 --> 43:24.200
Aron said...

43:25.600 --> 43:27.599
it might be half a
million pounds' worth.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.599
I think I'm going to prison, Tru.

43:30.600 --> 43:34.359
Ed, you're a bloody fool.
I know, I know!

43:34.360 --> 43:37.519
That's why I did it.
I needed money so bad.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.679
I knew I'd never do
anything off my own bat.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.639
That's no excuse.
We all need bloody money.

43:41.640 --> 43:44.200
But I made a promise.
What promise? To you.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.799
I promised you I'd get you
out of this town. Jesus...

43:47.800 --> 43:49.600
And I needed money to go on with it.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.600
What's this? Jesus.

44:04.840 --> 44:06.040
I'm sorry.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.400
I was going to tell you.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.320
Marry me, Tru.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.999
What? I don't care
about the English fella.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.119
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
it's all bygones.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.120
No, no, I'm not going to
bloody marry you.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.680
You're all that I've got.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.560
No.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.039
I never asked you to do this,

44:31.040 --> 44:33.720
and I'm not going to let you
make it into a problem.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.440
This is down to you,
Eddie, and you alone.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.240
I'm missing something.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.919
A group of adults, not just Ewan,

45:02.920 --> 45:04.560
trying to summon angels.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.199
But Sean said angels
can't live in our world,

45:08.200 --> 45:09.960
so what are they trying to achieve?

45:11.440 --> 45:17.360
And if they weren't just scrying,
then why do they need a child?

45:30.160 --> 45:32.200
Laura said he died in here.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.080
What if there were two?

45:42.720 --> 45:44.719
Two of what? What if
there were two children?

45:44.720 --> 45:46.080
What if they took two?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.320
OK.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.000
So, who was Aron selling to, Ed?

46:52.240 --> 46:54.039
I don't know.

46:54.040 --> 46:56.319
But it was his idea?

46:56.320 --> 46:58.399
I told you, no.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.800
Whose, then?

47:02.480 --> 47:03.720
Ed.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.640
He's dead now. What does it matter?
Dead?

47:12.120 --> 47:13.440
Mr Dean.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.079
You and Dean?

47:17.080 --> 47:18.800
He told me he was
going to let me go.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.519
Money troubles.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.040
I went to Aron, he had
a word with Mr Dean.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.440
Next thing I know, we're putting
strip lights up in the shed.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.120
"Easy money," Aron said. OK...

47:33.480 --> 47:36.240
So, why delay calling the
police after Mr Dean died?

47:37.680 --> 47:39.399
We wanted to clean the house up.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.039
Aron? He wanted to hide drugs?

47:42.040 --> 47:43.440
Aron didn't do it.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.680
Well, who, then?

47:48.560 --> 47:51.560
Come on, Ed!
You've done so well.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.560
Who cleaned up the house?

47:58.920 --> 48:00.480
Your call was welltimed.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.479
Dropped young David off with some
friends, so got the afternoon off.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.720
Nice.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.959
You, on the other hand,
look rather tense.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.559
Yeah, it's Matilda.
The Dean House is all locked up

48:12.560 --> 48:15.720
and she's not answering her phone...
Relax. I just saw her.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.039
Maybe an hour ago, in town.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.600
And she was OK? Erm, not entirely.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.639
Been talking to some local kook
whose filled her head

48:25.640 --> 48:28.359
with more nonsense about poor Carys.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.599
Something else bothering you?

48:30.600 --> 48:32.480
Well, the real reason
I called you...

48:36.840 --> 48:39.279
There was a police officer
originally out of Manchester

48:39.280 --> 48:42.279
called Mary McEwan.
Why are you asking?

48:42.280 --> 48:44.239
Do you know her?

48:44.240 --> 48:46.719
She transferred here,

48:46.720 --> 48:48.639
back when I was running the show.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.199
She'd had some problems
over in Manchester,

48:51.200 --> 48:53.679
made some enemies on the job, so...

48:53.680 --> 48:55.599
When was this?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.399
Late '93.

48:58.400 --> 49:01.839
But she wasn't here long.
She went Awol.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.559
You mean she disappeared?

49:03.560 --> 49:06.880
There had been some questions
about her mental stability.

49:08.200 --> 49:12.639
We'd had complaints about her
harassing people and behaving oddly,

49:12.640 --> 49:15.559
so when she went missing, it wasn't
really treated as suspicious.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.479
But...

49:17.480 --> 49:19.079
Sorry...

49:19.080 --> 49:23.479
That's '93, so you're saying
that she arrived in the area

49:23.480 --> 49:27.519
a few months before Carys went
missing, and then she disappeared?

49:27.520 --> 49:29.120
Not long after.

49:31.240 --> 49:35.799
You think Mary McEwan had something
to do with taking the girl?

49:35.800 --> 49:40.800
Two people died in a car crash in
Manchester and I have the idea...

49:42.600 --> 49:44.600
maybe Mary used their identities.

49:45.600 --> 49:49.359
I mean, not... I mean, used
their names to establish

49:49.360 --> 49:53.080
a new identity for herself,
and maybe Carys too.

49:54.680 --> 49:59.639
The way things were back in the
'90s, it could have been done.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.240
But why would she?
Cos you said she was unstable.

50:04.920 --> 50:08.280
Let me dig out my old files,
see what I can find on her.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.440
OK, thank you, thank you,
that's brilliant.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.239
I'm going to head into town
and track Matilda down. OK.

50:16.240 --> 50:21.279
I'll ring you when I've had a look
and if there is anything in this,

50:21.280 --> 50:24.520
anything at all, I promise you,
I will find it.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.080
OK. Thank you.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.240
Crazy He Calls Me
by Billie Holiday.

52:44.680 --> 52:46.920
False alarm,
it's just some newsagent.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.560
Are these made locally?
All made right here.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.880
After something for the little one?
No, I was actually...

53:06.560 --> 53:08.959
I'm looking for something like this.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.079
My goodness.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.519
I haven't stocked these for years.
My mam used to make them.

53:14.520 --> 53:17.720
Is your mum around?
Dead, love. Long time now.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.919
So, you wouldn't have any
record of who bought this?

53:22.920 --> 53:25.999
How could I? We'd have
sold dozens of them.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.879
Right, sure. I'm sorry
to waste your time.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.080
God!

53:32.320 --> 53:34.360
Sorry? Well, this.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.279
I think it's one of the originals.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.079
My mam made these for my kids,
her grandkids.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.919
So, this would have belonged
to one of your children?

53:43.920 --> 53:46.519
No, not this one.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.639
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

53:48.640 --> 53:52.759
There was this young lad, lived down
the road, his mam was a right mess.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.639
Drugs and the rest.

53:54.640 --> 53:58.279
So, your mum made him a toy?
She was like that, always helping.

53:58.280 --> 54:00.039
Erm...

54:00.040 --> 54:04.079
What happened the boy?
He was adopted, I think.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.599
No, what am I thinking. Hello?

54:07.600 --> 54:11.119
He went into care,
that's what the doctor said.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.719
The doctor?

54:12.720 --> 54:14.599
She came out to collect him.

54:14.600 --> 54:16.919
Doctor and her husband.
You knew them?

54:16.920 --> 54:18.959
Of course. Dr Satlow.

54:18.960 --> 54:21.840
Verity Satlow, lives
just outside town.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.479
The boy's mam cleared off
shortly after.

54:25.480 --> 54:29.719
Came into some money, they said, but
the boy, well, whatever happened,

54:29.720 --> 54:31.759
he was better off away from her.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.160
Bloody druggies.
Should sterilise them all.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.680
Erm, Matilda.

54:38.280 --> 54:41.160
Sorry, it's Graves. The cop.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.879
Excuse me, miss,
there's been an accident.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.799
I know there's been
a bloody accident.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.279
Where's Hal? PC Graves
will be over in a minute.

55:12.280 --> 55:14.080
She'll explain everything.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.759
Can you just tell me he's all right?

55:18.760 --> 55:20.280
He's gone.

55:25.280 --> 55:29.439
When I arrived at the scene,
the vehicle was empty.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.200
No sign of a driver.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.000
Seems like your
friend's disappeared.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.600
OK, thanks for letting me know.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.440
OK, bye.

56:03.160 --> 56:04.360
So?

56:05.760 --> 56:07.640
It seems there's been
a car accident.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.520
Just outside of town.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.479
English boy. Well.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.999
You know how these tourists drive.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.760
Bound to happen, eventually.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.320
You know...

56:23.960 --> 56:27.040
no matter how many times
we call them, I still feel it.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.920
Every time.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.120
The wonder.

56:34.760 --> 56:39.159
When you see what
we call forth tonight,

56:39.160 --> 56:41.400
then you'll know what wonder is.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.120
I think I'm a little afraid.

56:47.040 --> 56:51.759
Long is the way, and hard,

56:51.760 --> 56:55.160
that out of hell leads up to light.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.679
Sorry, David was hungry.

57:00.680 --> 57:03.119
Well, you've come
to the right place.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.440
Here you are, my boy. Tuck in.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.360
Just one, David. Rubbish.
You can have as many as you want.

57:12.120 --> 57:14.079
And I got you another present.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.880
It's a lucky charm.

57:17.640 --> 57:21.360
Helps sick people get better.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.040
Isn't that right, doctor?

57:25.920 --> 57:27.599
You keep that on.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.359
Never take it off.

57:29.360 --> 57:31.759
It'll help your mother get well.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.720
Wouldn't that be nice? Good boy.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.600
Your mother would be so proud.
