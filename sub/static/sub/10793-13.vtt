00:47.337 --> 00:48.404
Should you be out of bed?

00:48.405 --> 00:50.639
There's...

00:50.640 --> 00:52.474
there's too much work to be done.

00:52.475 --> 00:55.477
We'd best get on with it.

00:55.478 --> 00:57.146
"We?"

01:04.354 --> 01:05.421
Ready.

01:07.190 --> 01:10.125
All right, go ahead and re-pressurize.

01:10.126 --> 01:12.161
Re-pressurizing.

01:15.632 --> 01:18.300
It's holding steady.

01:26.176 --> 01:28.143
And we've got atmosphere.

01:28.144 --> 01:29.178
Very good.

01:29.179 --> 01:32.448
Continue with the repairs, beginning
with navigation and propulsion.

01:32.449 --> 01:34.416
Roger that.

01:36.152 --> 01:37.653
What the hell are you doing?

01:37.654 --> 01:42.191
Repairing the damaged
shuttle, if that's all right.

01:42.192 --> 01:43.559
I mean, you just had surgery.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.593
I'm fine, thank you.

01:44.594 --> 01:47.429
You look like you're ready to drop dead.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.431
And that would be a bad thing?

01:49.432 --> 01:52.201
Yes, Rush, that would be a bad thing.

01:52.202 --> 01:55.904
Listen to me, the civilians aboard
this ship didn't try to take over

01:55.905 --> 01:57.373
because they thought I
was doing a bang-up job.

01:57.374 --> 01:58.507
I get that.

01:58.508 --> 01:59.808
Well, good for you.

01:59.809 --> 02:01.243
I also get

02:01.244 --> 02:03.145
that I have to make this work.

02:03.146 --> 02:06.415
So I've ordered my people
to make a special effort.

02:06.416 --> 02:09.550
I would like to do the
same, even with you.

02:11.721 --> 02:14.623
That must have taken quite the effort.

02:14.624 --> 02:16.725
You have no idea.

02:21.197 --> 02:23.598
Lieutenant Scott, we
just dropped out of FTL.

02:23.599 --> 02:26.235
Please have a team ready on standby.

02:26.236 --> 02:27.436
Yes, sir.

02:27.437 --> 02:28.804
But the gate isn't dialing.

02:28.805 --> 02:31.407
Why not?

02:31.408 --> 02:33.142
Because there's nothing there.

02:33.143 --> 02:34.476
What?

02:34.477 --> 02:37.646
It appears we have dropped
out of FTL into empty space.

02:37.647 --> 02:39.081
No planets, no stars, nothing.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.418
You might want to re-check that data.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.412
The ship...

03:04.513 --> 03:07.983
I thought they send a record
of the star systems in our path.

03:08.184 --> 03:10.084
They do.

03:10.085 --> 03:12.921
That star...

03:12.922 --> 03:16.291
is not supposed to be here.

03:18.227 --> 03:20.628
All right, sit tight, guys.

03:20.629 --> 03:21.896
Gate's not dialing.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.032
They think it might be some
kind of a glitch in the database.

03:24.033 --> 03:27.368
And here I was worried I'd have
to cut short my delicious meal.

03:28.837 --> 03:30.672
You okay?

03:30.673 --> 03:32.240
Look like you might be
coming down with something.

03:34.710 --> 03:35.710
I'm fine.

03:35.711 --> 03:37.979
Just... tired.

03:46.055 --> 03:47.856
We call that...

03:47.857 --> 03:50.159
Cold. Yeah.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.794
Yeah, it's going to take a little time.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.365
And "special effort on our part

03:56.366 --> 03:59.034
towards a spirit of cooperation".

03:59.035 --> 04:01.270
Yeah, well, the Colonel's
right about that.

04:01.271 --> 04:02.771
We have to live with these people.

04:02.772 --> 04:03.872
Doesn't mean I got to like it.

04:03.873 --> 04:05.074
Yeah, you do.

04:05.075 --> 04:07.109
At least, you have to look like you do.

04:07.110 --> 04:08.944
Good luck with that.

04:12.115 --> 04:13.682
Am I wrong?

04:13.683 --> 04:15.451
Does she look like she's
coming down with something?

04:15.452 --> 04:17.853
It's a G-2 star.

04:17.853 --> 04:21.490
Yellow dwarf, similar to our own sun.

04:21.491 --> 04:24.260
Because Destiny didn't know it was here,

04:24.261 --> 04:29.932
the star's gravity well
disrupted our propulsion systems,

04:29.933 --> 04:32.802
causing us to drop out
of FTL prematurely.

04:32.803 --> 04:35.472
It's a glitch in the technology.

04:35.473 --> 04:37.841
So what happens now?

04:37.842 --> 04:40.277
We've entered a parabolic course.

04:40.278 --> 04:42.078
Once we're 'round the star,

04:42.079 --> 04:43.346
we'll be far enough away

04:43.347 --> 04:45.315
from its gravitational influence,

04:45.316 --> 04:49.286
back into FTL, and on our way.

04:49.287 --> 04:52.222
How Long's that going to take?

04:52.223 --> 04:54.824
A few weeks.

04:54.825 --> 04:56.760
There is, however, a silver lining.

04:58.763 --> 05:00.096
A planet?

05:00.097 --> 05:03.300
Only one in the solar
system, so far as I can see.

05:03.301 --> 05:06.503
About the same size as earth.

05:06.504 --> 05:08.104
Looks close.

05:08.105 --> 05:09.172
It is.

05:12.076 --> 05:13.276
Within shuttle range.

05:13.277 --> 05:15.512
Atmosphere?

05:15.513 --> 05:19.250
In a word? Perfect.

05:28.226 --> 05:33.264
I've been over the database
a dozen times.

05:33.265 --> 05:37.301
No evidence of any glitch or anomaly.

05:39.071 --> 05:41.439
Yeah, I couldn't find anything either.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.242
It's like this star just
appeared out of nowhere.

05:45.243 --> 05:47.278
Well, vigorous surface activity,

05:47.279 --> 05:50.281
strong stellar winds, bipolar outflow.

05:50.282 --> 05:51.382
It's brand-new, all right.

05:51.383 --> 05:53.050
It's straight out of t... tauri phase.

05:53.051 --> 05:56.887
Which would still make it like,
what, a hundred million years old?

05:56.888 --> 05:58.923
It's 200 million.

06:01.393 --> 06:03.562
And how far ahead of us are
those gate-seeding ships?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.964
It doesn't make any sense.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.432
The ships would have noticed it.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.402
And dropped a shiny new
Stargate on the planet.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.970
That's the weirder thing about this.

06:11.971 --> 06:15.040
I mean,
if this star really is this Young,

06:15.041 --> 06:18.543
then that planet should still
be a ball of molten rock.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.926
All right, we're through
the upper atmosphere.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.862
Everything looks good.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.330
I'm going to set her down

06:38.331 --> 06:41.566
on that land mass directly below us.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.279
No sign of any wildlife.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.416
That we can see.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.661
It's pure.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.468
How you feeling?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.469
Great.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.305
A little sunshine, fresh air, water.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.473
Just what I needed.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.642
Yo, check this out!

07:24.178 --> 07:28.548
There's a whole grove of trees
back there loaded with these things.

07:32.187 --> 07:34.087
It's like a kiwi.

07:34.088 --> 07:35.088
We'll take it back and
do an edibility test...

07:35.089 --> 07:35.923
I'll do one right now.

07:35.924 --> 07:36.924
Greer!

07:36.925 --> 07:40.294
What the hell are you doing?

07:41.930 --> 07:43.030
That's nice.

07:43.031 --> 07:44.498
We don't even know if it's poisonous.

07:44.499 --> 07:48.335
We will.

07:48.336 --> 07:50.904
We're getting a ton of plant samples.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.407
TJ thinks there's all sorts
of medicinal possibilities.

07:53.408 --> 07:54.575
Well, that's great, that's great.

07:54.576 --> 07:57.211
We also found some fruit.

07:57.212 --> 08:00.047
Greer went ahead and ate one.

08:00.048 --> 08:02.149
So far he hasn't had
any reactions to it.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.584
How about water?

08:03.585 --> 08:04.918
Tons of it.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.487
Pure, too.

08:06.488 --> 08:07.688
We'll bring back
as much of it as we can.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.990
No alien creatures slithering around?

08:09.991 --> 08:11.525
No, nothing.

08:11.526 --> 08:16.263
It's weird, but it's daytime, so
who knows what comes out at night.

08:16.264 --> 08:17.565
All right, load up the shuttle,

08:17.566 --> 08:19.067
and head on back.

08:19.068 --> 08:20.935
Do a fly-over of the area on your way.

08:20.936 --> 08:23.238
Copy that. Scott out.

08:26.942 --> 08:29.077
There you are.

08:29.078 --> 08:31.112
This place.

08:31.113 --> 08:32.380
It reminds me of home.

08:34.116 --> 08:39.654
We used to go camping,
Olympic peninsula.

08:39.655 --> 08:42.289
My dad and I, we'd go hiking

08:42.291 --> 08:46.027
for days at a time,
find these amazing vistas

08:46.028 --> 08:53.535
and canyons, waterfalls...

08:55.538 --> 08:57.305
Time to go, TJ.

09:16.726 --> 09:19.628
Damn near perfect.

09:19.629 --> 09:22.031
It doesn't makes any sense,

09:22.032 --> 09:23.465
the ship not knowing about this place.

09:23.466 --> 09:25.467
Of all the planets to put a Stargate on,

09:25.468 --> 09:27.636
I would think that...

09:47.124 --> 09:50.460
Looks like we weren't
the first ones here.

09:52.486 --> 09:54.587
It's massive. 2,000 feet high, at least.

09:54.588 --> 09:58.491
We detected a faint EM field
around it, but nothing else.

09:58.492 --> 09:59.993
Those markings.

09:59.994 --> 10:02.662
Like some kind of alien language.

10:02.663 --> 10:05.531
Do you think it's the same
ones we keep running into?

10:05.532 --> 10:07.934
Not with this level of technology.

10:07.935 --> 10:09.502
What, to build this thing?

10:09.503 --> 10:11.437
No...

10:11.438 --> 10:12.972
To create a planet.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.175
They actually built this planet?

10:18.612 --> 10:20.914
The genesis device.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.917
The end of wrath of Kahn.

10:24.918 --> 10:27.186
The reason why Destiny had no knowledge

10:27.187 --> 10:29.923
of this star system is
that it was placed there

10:29.924 --> 10:31.692
after the gate-seeding
ships had passed through.

10:31.693 --> 10:34.595
Wait, you're telling me
they built the star too?

10:35.931 --> 10:39.934
That would make them the number
one all-time advanced civilization.

10:39.935 --> 10:41.268
That would be an understatement.

10:41.269 --> 10:43.103
Okay, so, what do we do about this?

10:43.104 --> 10:45.172
We send a team back down there.

10:45.173 --> 10:46.573
What?

10:46.574 --> 10:49.043
Look, our orbit has been refined.

10:49.044 --> 10:50.244
It's going to be four weeks,

10:50.245 --> 10:51.445
two days, seven hours

10:51.446 --> 10:53.047
before we jump back to FTL.

10:53.048 --> 10:55.115
I'm proposing we take
advantage of the wait.

10:55.116 --> 10:57.384
I thought you said we were
almost out of shuttle range.

10:57.385 --> 11:00.120
We are, but...

11:00.121 --> 11:05.125
We're going to swing back into
range once we circle the star

11:05.126 --> 11:06.927
and before we jump to FTL.

11:06.928 --> 11:08.262
We send a team down now,

11:08.263 --> 11:11.598
and we can pick them back up in a
month's time, loaded with supplies.

11:11.599 --> 11:13.334
We time it right on the return,

11:13.335 --> 11:14.935
we could take two, maybe three trips.

11:14.936 --> 11:17.539
What about the aliens?

11:17.540 --> 11:19.207
We didn't see them.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.409
Well, it doesn't mean
that they're not around.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.946
Look, we have three hours left

11:24.947 --> 11:27.282
before we're out of shuttle range.

11:27.283 --> 11:29.951
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it quickly.

11:29.952 --> 11:34.589
Okay, okay, just to say this out loud,

11:34.590 --> 11:39.327
assuming that this star
and this planet were created

11:39.328 --> 11:43.064
by the most incredibly
advanced aliens ever,

11:43.065 --> 11:45.633
maybe they don't want anyone
messing around with it.

11:45.634 --> 11:47.969
We need the food and medicine.

11:47.970 --> 11:50.105
I agree.

11:50.106 --> 11:51.306
The gains outweigh the risks.

11:51.307 --> 11:52.340
Do they?

11:52.341 --> 11:55.477
We're 0-for-3 on close
encounters of the third kind.

11:55.478 --> 11:59.114
What makes you think that these
guys are going to be any different?

11:59.115 --> 12:01.717
I'm not sending anyone down
there without protection.

12:01.718 --> 12:04.086
And we'll have the shuttle
in case we got to bug out.

12:04.087 --> 12:06.222
Eli...

12:06.223 --> 12:08.524
Everything we do out here is a risk.

12:12.629 --> 12:15.631
TJ...

12:15.632 --> 12:17.033
Hi.

12:17.034 --> 12:21.470
I heard you found some plants
with possible analgesic properties?

12:21.471 --> 12:24.006
Yes, high concentration of salic.

12:24.007 --> 12:25.374
Similar to aspirin.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.475
You got a headache?

12:26.476 --> 12:28.411
Only since I've been on this ship.

12:33.283 --> 12:37.219
Take these, steep them in
hot water, and drink it.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.622
So, you're joining the team

12:39.623 --> 12:41.590
going down to the planet?

12:41.591 --> 12:43.059
Yeah, all types of medicinals.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.029
I, can't pass it up.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.164
How about you?

12:47.165 --> 12:48.398
Oh, I don't know.

12:48.399 --> 12:51.501
I mean, part of me wants to, but...

12:51.502 --> 12:54.104
What if Rush's calculations are off?

12:54.105 --> 12:58.341
Can we trust him?

12:58.342 --> 13:01.044
You tell me.

13:02.547 --> 13:05.148
I want 'round the clock watch on camps.

13:05.149 --> 13:07.517
Guard details on every science
team going into the woods.

13:07.518 --> 13:08.852
Yes, sir.

13:08.853 --> 13:10.787
Hopefully we'll be able
to fix the damaged shuttle

13:10.788 --> 13:13.223
before you return, and double
up on supplies we can bring back.

13:16.227 --> 13:17.227
Good luck.

13:17.228 --> 13:18.428
Thanks.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.464
You're coming too?

13:20.465 --> 13:21.565
Is there a problem with that?

13:21.566 --> 13:24.034
No.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.069
Happy camping.

13:30.141 --> 13:31.142
You all set?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.443
Yes, sir.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.146
Cole will be looking after Franklin
in the infirmary while I'm away.

13:35.147 --> 13:40.618
I told her to contact me if
there's any change in his condition.

13:40.619 --> 13:42.487
Is there anything else?

13:44.256 --> 13:45.756
No, sir.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.404
We're clear.

14:00.405 --> 14:02.240
We'll see you in a month.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.263
All right, folks, you got the
whole month to enjoy the scenery.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.733
We need to set up camp,
establish a perimeter.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.835
Sun moves that way.

15:02.836 --> 15:03.870
Guys?

15:03.871 --> 15:06.139
Over here?

15:06.140 --> 15:08.308
Sun moves that way,
so that's west, okay?

15:08.309 --> 15:10.577
River's back that way
about half a klick...

15:10.578 --> 15:11.811
Uh, kilometer.

15:11.812 --> 15:13.913
We'll sleep in the shuttle for now,

15:13.914 --> 15:16.649
but I want shelters built asap.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.619
How many of you guys
have gone camping before?

15:20.854 --> 15:22.689
Well, okay, that's fine.

15:22.690 --> 15:24.624
Just watch, ask, and learn.

15:24.625 --> 15:25.858
You guys know your team assignments.

15:25.859 --> 15:26.926
Let's get going.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.935
I don't have a team yet.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.704
Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

15:37.705 --> 15:39.706
Do you feel like helping TJ with plants?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.774
Sure.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.676
Okay.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.581
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:47.582 --> 15:48.716
What's going on over here?

15:48.717 --> 15:51.485
I'm not digging the latrine.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.023
Is that what you told him to do?

15:56.024 --> 15:57.992
Somebody's got to do it.

16:01.796 --> 16:02.963
True enough.

16:02.964 --> 16:04.632
Start digging.

16:04.633 --> 16:05.766
What?

16:05.767 --> 16:06.834
No, you can't make me.

16:06.835 --> 16:07.835
You too.

16:07.836 --> 16:08.736
But Sergeant, I...

16:08.737 --> 16:10.537
You're going to dig, okay?

16:10.538 --> 16:12.106
You're both going to dig,

16:12.107 --> 16:13.407
and you're going to
love every moment of it,

16:13.408 --> 16:18.746
or you will keep digging until you do.

16:18.747 --> 16:19.880
The spirit of co-operation.

16:21.182 --> 16:25.085
We're all friends now.

16:27.822 --> 16:31.526
So we'll photograph and
log every plant we find.

16:31.527 --> 16:36.564
Don't ingest anything until
we do a proper edibility test.

16:36.565 --> 16:38.199
You all right?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.169
Yeah, just...

16:43.973 --> 16:47.075
It's passing. I'm fine.

16:51.514 --> 16:55.517
The amount of food and
water we get on that ship,

16:55.518 --> 16:58.720
it's a wonder we're not all
fainting from malnutrition.

17:00.523 --> 17:02.057
Well, I just got the word.

17:02.058 --> 17:05.093
Destiny is now officially out of range.

17:05.094 --> 17:06.661
No turning back.

17:06.662 --> 17:10.565
We are stuck here.

17:28.133 --> 17:29.233
Hey.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.035
Hey.

17:35.707 --> 17:37.541
How's it going?

17:37.542 --> 17:40.277
Well, I hope they bring
back tons of food.

17:40.278 --> 17:41.946
The last of that fruit
that they brought back

17:41.947 --> 17:44.682
is already gone.

17:44.683 --> 17:47.084
Or so you think.

17:53.124 --> 17:56.160
Snuck this earlier.

17:56.161 --> 18:00.565
I'll split it with you if
you promise not to rat me out.

18:00.566 --> 18:02.067
Deal.

18:05.571 --> 18:08.106
So, tell me...

18:08.107 --> 18:09.374
Thanks.

18:09.375 --> 18:12.978
You think it's possible
to create a star?

18:12.979 --> 18:15.213
Nah! No way.

18:15.214 --> 18:18.617
Now, being transported to a ship

18:18.618 --> 18:19.651
on the other side of the universe

18:19.652 --> 18:22.954
by a wormhole, that's totally doable.

18:27.193 --> 18:31.763
Look, that star just
appeared out of nowhere,

18:31.764 --> 18:34.299
and the planet's age doesn't match.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.801
If some all-powerful alien beings

18:36.802 --> 18:42.107
didn't create it, who did?

18:52.919 --> 18:55.054
Aw, jeez, hey, I'm sorry!

18:55.055 --> 18:56.155
I'll go somewhere else.

18:56.156 --> 18:57.156
Oh, no.

18:57.157 --> 18:58.658
No, no, that's okay.

19:01.028 --> 19:02.561
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

19:02.562 --> 19:04.997
I know all the military personnel

19:04.998 --> 19:07.133
are trying to mend fences,

19:07.134 --> 19:09.035
but you're one of the few

19:09.036 --> 19:10.670
who actually seems to mean it.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.705
Yeah, well, we've got
to work it out, right?

19:12.706 --> 19:15.274
It's interesting that we've now
been given the time down here

19:15.275 --> 19:16.575
to do that.

19:16.576 --> 19:19.679
Yeah, well, we were pretty
lucky to find this place.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.049
My mom used to say there's
no such thing as luck.

19:23.050 --> 19:25.618
Only the hand of God,

19:25.619 --> 19:27.853
giving you a little help
when you need it most.

19:29.089 --> 19:30.557
Somewhere along the line,

19:30.558 --> 19:33.193
I mean, I stopped believing all that,

19:33.194 --> 19:35.929
but now...

19:35.930 --> 19:42.836
I look at this place, put right
in our path for us to find.

19:44.172 --> 19:48.642
Tell me that isn't a miracle.

19:48.643 --> 19:50.577
Hey, how's it going?

19:50.578 --> 19:51.545
Great.

19:51.546 --> 19:52.846
Terrible.

19:52.847 --> 19:54.247
Which is it?

19:54.248 --> 19:56.149
Propulsion's almost completely shot.

19:56.150 --> 19:57.651
Might be able to get to the point

19:57.652 --> 19:59.019
where we can fly down to the planet,

19:59.020 --> 20:00.854
but there's no way it's going to
have enough power to get back up.

20:00.855 --> 20:02.155
So there's that.

20:02.156 --> 20:04.157
We're making some
progress on navigation.

20:04.158 --> 20:06.960
We can turn left, but
not right, or up, or down.

20:06.961 --> 20:08.628
Okay.

20:08.629 --> 20:10.831
Why did you say "great"?

20:10.832 --> 20:13.266
We can turn left.

20:13.267 --> 20:16.838
Colonel Young.

20:16.839 --> 20:18.306
Go ahead.

20:18.307 --> 20:20.742
While Destiny 's engines are off-line,

20:20.743 --> 20:22.944
I'd like to use the extra
power to strengthen the shield,

20:22.945 --> 20:25.713
maybe explore some
damaged areas in the ship,

20:25.714 --> 20:28.249
possibly make some repairs.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.585
Reclaim some real estate.

20:30.586 --> 20:31.886
Exactly.

20:31.887 --> 20:33.688
You go ahead.

20:33.689 --> 20:36.224
I'll have Lieutenant
James put a team together.

20:36.225 --> 20:38.326
You two, you keep at it.

20:38.327 --> 20:39.794
You have a month
to get this thing to fly

20:39.795 --> 20:43.831
to and from that planet and
do more than make a left turn.

20:46.835 --> 20:48.736
Fate brought us here?

20:48.737 --> 20:50.104
I don't know, maybe.

20:50.105 --> 20:53.841
Maybe that's what brought us
to Icarus and then Destiny.

20:55.244 --> 20:58.679
You don't believe that?

20:58.680 --> 21:00.048
You miss your flight
and the plane crashes.

21:00.049 --> 21:01.350
You weren't spared for a reason.

21:01.351 --> 21:02.785
God doesn't have a master plan for you.

21:02.786 --> 21:03.952
Things just happen.

21:03.953 --> 21:08.323
So we're born, we live, we die?

21:08.324 --> 21:09.825
It's all random?

21:09.826 --> 21:11.059
Yeah, and along the way, you do the best

21:11.060 --> 21:12.694
with whatever crap
you happen to step in.

21:19.702 --> 21:23.906
I'm starting to get a bad feeling.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.642
Me too.

21:26.643 --> 21:32.247
I'm afraid we made a mistake sending
those people down to that planet.

21:35.618 --> 21:37.920
No...

21:37.921 --> 21:42.224
The mistake was not going with them.

23:34.073 --> 23:36.741
You okay?

23:36.742 --> 23:37.842
Here...

23:38.978 --> 23:40.845
Gosh...

23:40.846 --> 23:42.747
I thought you were feeling better.

23:42.748 --> 23:45.483
Yeah. I am.

23:45.484 --> 23:47.953
Here, let me help you back to camp.

23:47.954 --> 23:48.920
You should lie down.

23:48.921 --> 23:51.489
No, Chloe...

23:51.490 --> 23:52.757
I'm not sick.

24:03.370 --> 24:04.804
How far along?

24:04.805 --> 24:07.473
About 15 weeks.

24:07.474 --> 24:09.308
Right before we left Icarus,

24:09.309 --> 24:11.911
but nobody knows, and I'd
like to keep it that way.

24:11.912 --> 24:13.846
Well, eventually they're going to...

24:13.847 --> 24:15.114
I know,

24:15.115 --> 24:16.482
I know, but not now.

24:16.483 --> 24:18.851
I'll figure out when the right time is.

24:18.852 --> 24:20.386
Okay?

24:20.387 --> 24:22.521
Yeah.

24:22.522 --> 24:23.490
Sure.

24:23.491 --> 24:26.425
Back on the ship, I wasn't doing well,

24:26.426 --> 24:29.028
getting anemic, but out here,

24:29.029 --> 24:31.464
with all the food and water...

24:31.465 --> 24:33.766
Actually, the morning
sickness is a good sign.

24:36.336 --> 24:38.304
What about the father?

24:43.076 --> 24:44.510
What the hell is it?

24:44.511 --> 24:46.813
I don't know yet.

24:46.814 --> 24:48.048
Looks like a robot.

24:50.018 --> 24:51.752
Figure it out.

24:51.753 --> 24:52.953
Oh, yeah, no problem.

24:52.954 --> 24:55.222
Once I've attended to the
other hundred things on my list.

24:55.223 --> 24:56.790
You can always put somebody else on it.

24:56.791 --> 24:59.793
I'm not going to have anyone touch
this thing without me present.

24:59.794 --> 25:03.430
I'm going to get to it, Colonel.

25:03.431 --> 25:04.464
Close it up.

25:04.465 --> 25:07.034
Okay.

25:09.537 --> 25:12.305
Hey.

25:12.306 --> 25:14.474
Are you okay?

25:14.475 --> 25:16.109
Yeah.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.411
Homesick for Destiny?

25:17.412 --> 25:21.848
Only a few more days till we head back.

25:21.849 --> 25:23.517
Honestly?

25:23.518 --> 25:25.252
No.

25:26.454 --> 25:30.391
I'm not.

25:30.392 --> 25:31.759
I like it here.

25:34.229 --> 25:37.765
I'm starting to wonder
if Dr. Caine is right.

25:37.766 --> 25:41.169
That it's no accident
we found this planet.

25:41.170 --> 25:43.504
We were brought here by God?

25:43.505 --> 25:45.306
Or whoever.

25:45.307 --> 25:46.874
I don't know.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.243
I mean, if some alien beings

25:49.244 --> 25:54.182
are powerful enough
to create this place...

25:54.183 --> 25:56.517
Maybe there is some kind of

25:56.518 --> 25:58.219
higher power in the universe

25:58.220 --> 25:59.954
that knew we were in trouble,

25:59.955 --> 26:02.890
put this planet here for us to find.

26:02.891 --> 26:05.993
Maybe it's time
we stop thinking about...

26:08.030 --> 26:09.831
Oh, hey, what's that?

26:24.949 --> 26:26.250
When?

26:26.251 --> 26:28.919
Tonight, just now,
coming from the obelisk,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.220
shooting straight up into the sky.

26:30.221 --> 26:34.057
Dr. Volker detected some kind of a...

26:34.058 --> 26:35.792
A strange radiation.

26:35.793 --> 26:37.895
He's working on it.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.031
It's like this whole thing
suddenly came to life.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.366
Why now?

26:42.367 --> 26:44.201
Why not when they first got there?

26:44.202 --> 26:48.372
Perhaps their initial impact
wasn't enough to trigger an alert.

26:48.373 --> 26:49.540
But now...

26:49.541 --> 26:54.278
So this light, you think it'll
bring the aliens back to the planet?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.446
You won't be there to find out.

26:56.447 --> 26:59.317
Destiny is almost in range.

26:59.318 --> 27:04.022
Colonel Young wants us to start
breaking up camp, get ready to head back.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.089
What about the obelisk?

27:05.090 --> 27:06.124
I need time to figure out...

27:06.125 --> 27:07.559
We don't have enough time.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.860
We need to be ready to fly

27:08.861 --> 27:10.495
as soon as Destiny is in range

27:10.496 --> 27:12.997
so we can make a couple trips,

27:12.998 --> 27:16.067
and get all that food back to the ship.

27:17.469 --> 27:21.206
All right, people, you heard
the man. Move your asses!

27:21.207 --> 27:22.340
Let's go.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.281
Yes?

27:30.282 --> 27:31.916
Yes. Well...

27:31.917 --> 27:32.917
No.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.153
Again with this?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.854
The shuttle can fly.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.190
It can now go both left
and right and up and down.

27:39.191 --> 27:43.294
But like I said before, too
many problems with propulsion.

27:43.295 --> 27:47.199
Fact is, we may never be
able to fully repair it.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.803
All kinds of citrus-type
fruits, beans, potatoes...

27:50.804 --> 27:52.338
Sweet potatoes.

27:52.339 --> 27:54.340
Scott says they're amazing.

27:54.341 --> 27:58.444
They cannot get back here fast enough.

27:58.445 --> 28:00.145
You seem concerned, Dr. Rush.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.515
Something we should know about?

28:03.516 --> 28:05.117
No.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.186
No problems
with your calculations, right?

28:07.187 --> 28:09.788
The shuttle will return as scheduled?

28:09.789 --> 28:14.927
Yeah, and Destiny will leave this system

28:14.928 --> 28:16.295
never knowing who created it...

28:17.897 --> 28:19.965
Or why.

28:47.094 --> 28:49.362
You might want to give her some time.

28:49.363 --> 28:52.032
Well, we're breaking camp, and she
just takes off without telling me?

28:52.033 --> 28:53.166
She's thinking about staying here.

28:53.167 --> 28:54.234
A lot of people are.

28:54.235 --> 28:57.604
Come on, you can't be surprised.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.005
You've heard people talking about it.

28:59.006 --> 29:00.273
They like it here.

29:00.274 --> 29:02.942
I like it here too, but we cannot stay.

29:02.943 --> 29:04.010
It is out of the question.

29:04.011 --> 29:05.145
Why not?

29:05.146 --> 29:07.180
If people want to stay,
they have the right...

29:07.181 --> 29:08.248
Where the hell have you been?

29:08.249 --> 29:09.349
We've got to move.

29:11.285 --> 29:12.886
I'm not going.

29:14.022 --> 29:16.190
Okay, look, I understand how you feel.

29:16.191 --> 29:18.526
I like it here too, but we cannot stay.

29:18.527 --> 29:19.627
The Colonel gave us orders...

29:19.628 --> 29:21.028
Matt, don't!

29:21.029 --> 29:22.296
I can't go back there.

29:22.297 --> 29:23.531
Why not?

29:23.532 --> 29:24.565
It's safer here.

29:24.566 --> 29:26.867
Safer?

29:26.868 --> 29:29.103
The aliens who built this
rock may be on their way back!

29:29.104 --> 29:30.104
Then good.

29:30.105 --> 29:31.372
I mean, if they're advanced enough

29:31.373 --> 29:34.008
to build a solar system,

29:34.009 --> 29:36.377
I know they can help us get back home.

29:36.378 --> 29:39.146
Not if they don't wipe us out first.

29:39.147 --> 29:42.116
Why do you immediately think
they're going to harm us?

29:42.117 --> 29:45.252
I'm sorry, do you not remember
what the last aliens did to you?

29:45.253 --> 29:47.288
This planet was created for us.

29:47.289 --> 29:50.291
We were led here for a reason.

29:50.292 --> 29:52.460
Oh, for God's sake...

29:52.461 --> 29:53.894
What if they don't come back?

29:53.895 --> 29:54.895
Then what?

29:54.896 --> 29:58.199
I'm okay with that.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.267
I'm healthier here.

29:59.268 --> 30:00.535
There's food and plenty of water.

30:00.536 --> 30:02.637
And we're bringing a ton of it back!

30:02.638 --> 30:05.574
And eventually, it'll run out.

30:05.575 --> 30:07.275
Okay, what about the winters?

30:07.276 --> 30:09.077
Dr. Volker, you said you found evidence

30:09.078 --> 30:11.546
it gets very cold here.

30:11.547 --> 30:14.916
Yes, well below freezing,
for months, TJ.

30:14.917 --> 30:16.284
So we'll build better shelters.

30:16.285 --> 30:17.652
I don't even think it will come to that.

30:17.653 --> 30:20.355
The beings who created
this world will return.

30:20.356 --> 30:22.157
And they will help us get back home.

30:22.158 --> 30:22.958
I know it.

30:24.460 --> 30:26.995
You would rather take your
chances out here than on Destiny?

30:26.996 --> 30:28.997
We don't know where that ship is going,

30:28.998 --> 30:30.065
or if we'll ever even make it home.

30:30.066 --> 30:31.433
There's a Stargate on it.

30:31.434 --> 30:32.601
As long as we have the
potential to connect...

30:32.602 --> 30:35.137
Matt...

30:37.206 --> 30:40.008
I'm pregnant.

30:43.012 --> 30:44.947
I can't go back there.

30:46.583 --> 30:51.554
I can't stand the thought of
raising a child on that ship.

30:57.027 --> 30:58.294
We are in range.

30:58.295 --> 31:00.029
You are clear to make
the first trip back.

31:00.030 --> 31:03.466
We only have the one shuttle,
so time is of the essence.

31:03.467 --> 31:05.701
Sir...

31:05.702 --> 31:06.936
We have a problem down here.

31:06.937 --> 31:08.037
What is it?

31:08.038 --> 31:10.306
Some of the people have decided

31:10.307 --> 31:12.642
that they would like to
stay behind on the planet.

31:12.643 --> 31:14.243
Well, you tell them no.

31:14.244 --> 31:15.711
I tried, sir.

31:15.712 --> 31:18.681
They have pretty much made up their minds.

31:18.682 --> 31:20.450
Who are they?

31:20.951 --> 31:23.052
11 people total.

31:24.454 --> 31:27.022
Dr. Caine,

31:27.023 --> 31:29.459
Chloe,

31:29.460 --> 31:30.593
Lieutenant Johansen...

31:30.594 --> 31:31.828
What?

31:31.829 --> 31:33.930
No! Scott, you tell them...

31:33.931 --> 31:36.567
And me.

31:40.678 --> 31:41.678
11?

31:41.679 --> 31:43.712
Including some of my own people.

31:43.713 --> 31:45.014
And Scott, he has the nerve

31:45.015 --> 31:47.149
to ask me to fly him
back down to the planet

31:47.150 --> 31:48.884
after he drops off the
ones returning to the ship.

31:48.885 --> 31:50.119
Well, look, I can understand

31:50.120 --> 31:52.221
some of them wanting to stay,

31:52.222 --> 31:54.256
but Lieutenant Scott and TJ?

31:54.257 --> 31:55.991
Yeah, he says he feels an obligation

31:55.992 --> 31:58.861
to help the people survive down there.

31:58.862 --> 32:00.262
What are you going to do?

32:00.263 --> 32:01.630
What am I going to do?

32:01.631 --> 32:03.566
I'm going to make sure they don't
stay down there, that's for damn sure.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.401
No, no, you cannot
force them to come back.

32:05.402 --> 32:07.069
Oh, I think he can.

32:07.070 --> 32:08.971
We're going to lose more people

32:08.972 --> 32:11.207
through attrition aboard this ship.

32:11.208 --> 32:14.344
We simply cannot afford to shed
that many people at one time.

32:14.345 --> 32:15.412
So, what do you expect him to do?

32:15.413 --> 32:16.546
Bring them back at gunpoint?

32:16.547 --> 32:18.348
Well, if it comes to that, yes.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.252
You allow Lieutenant Scott

32:22.253 --> 32:25.021
to return with those who
want to come back to Destiny,

32:25.022 --> 32:27.891
then send down a military
detail and round up the rest.

32:27.892 --> 32:29.459
Oh, that's great, Rush, coming from you.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.494
First you want to kick the military out,

32:31.495 --> 32:36.266
and now you want us rounding
people up at gunpoint.

32:36.267 --> 32:40.270
Colonel, those people have the right

32:40.271 --> 32:43.473
to make their own decisions
about their future.

32:46.477 --> 32:47.845
Not all of them.

32:51.417 --> 32:52.838
Did you...

32:54.418 --> 32:56.920
did you tell him about me?

32:56.921 --> 32:58.354
I'll let you do that.

32:58.355 --> 33:00.524
It's not my place.

33:04.229 --> 33:05.696
He is the father, right?

33:10.735 --> 33:12.603
I caught a few looks between you.

33:14.239 --> 33:15.673
I don't think anyone else knew.

33:15.674 --> 33:17.875
I haven't heard any rumors or anything.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.980
Hey...

33:24.549 --> 33:25.583
Hey...

33:28.286 --> 33:29.486
You are going to be okay.

33:32.757 --> 33:40.230
I'll be here, and I'm not going
to let anything happen to you.

33:51.243 --> 33:52.644
Have you gone mad?

33:52.645 --> 33:53.645
Oh, man, look, I really
don't want to argue with you.

33:53.646 --> 33:54.646
You're letting them stay?

33:54.647 --> 33:55.647
Not all of them.

33:55.648 --> 33:56.648
And you're giving them a shuttle?

33:56.649 --> 33:57.649
The damaged shuttle.

33:57.650 --> 33:58.650
It's not damaged anymore!

33:58.651 --> 34:01.353
Didn't you say that the shuttle
may never be fully functional?

34:01.354 --> 34:02.954
We may need the shuttle
for any number of reasons...

34:02.955 --> 34:04.189
I'm not going to leave those
people down there with nothing...

34:04.190 --> 34:05.523
You cannot let them stay, Colonel...

34:05.524 --> 34:07.292
I have made my decision.

34:08.893 --> 34:10.629
Is it ready?

34:10.630 --> 34:13.498
Yeah, but there's still some issues

34:13.498 --> 34:14.532
as to whether it can hold up

34:14.533 --> 34:15.867
through atmospheric entry.

34:15.868 --> 34:18.870
Questions that are about to be answered.

34:27.647 --> 34:29.482
Eli just radioed.

34:29.483 --> 34:31.751
Colonel Young is on his way down here.

34:31.752 --> 34:33.284
Why?

34:33.286 --> 34:35.755
How?

34:42.663 --> 34:45.831
We're entering upper atmosphere.

34:55.375 --> 34:56.976
So far so good.

34:59.980 --> 35:02.548
Come on, hold it together.

35:09.489 --> 35:11.457
Yeah, right there!

35:15.396 --> 35:17.030
Destiny, this is Young.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.999
I made it through.

35:37.085 --> 35:39.953
Has anyone changed their minds
about returning to the ship?

35:41.489 --> 35:42.622
No.

35:43.925 --> 35:44.958
All right.

35:44.959 --> 35:47.494
Here's the deal.

35:47.495 --> 35:54.701
I am leaving the damaged shuttle
bend for those who want to stay.

35:54.702 --> 35:57.104
You can use it for shelter and power,

35:57.105 --> 36:00.074
fly around in short hops on the surface.

36:00.075 --> 36:04.645
You will not be able to leave
the atmosphere, so don't even try.

36:04.646 --> 36:07.882
What it will do is give
you guys a fighting chance

36:07.883 --> 36:12.420
while you are down here,
especially with winter on the way.

36:12.421 --> 36:13.721
Thank you, Colonel. I know this isn't...

36:13.722 --> 36:15.189
I'm not finished.

36:15.190 --> 36:19.026
I will leave it for you
only under one condition.

36:19.027 --> 36:22.497
All military personnel will
return with me to Destiny.

36:24.700 --> 36:28.870
Reject my proposal, and we'll
take you all back by force.

36:28.871 --> 36:30.872
You can't do that.

36:30.873 --> 36:34.008
That's not something
you want to test, doctor.

36:34.009 --> 36:35.977
Sir, some of these people
just don't feel safe on board.

36:35.978 --> 36:37.779
None of us feels safe.

36:37.780 --> 36:38.613
That doesn't mean we give up.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.882
They're not giving up.

36:40.883 --> 36:42.984
That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.

36:42.985 --> 36:44.853
I disagree, sir.

36:46.222 --> 36:48.223
I believe we were brought here,

36:48.224 --> 36:52.628
and that whoever created this
planet will provide for us.

36:52.629 --> 36:56.732
They are our best chance
of getting back home.

37:02.705 --> 37:05.240
Okay.

37:08.545 --> 37:11.814
What's it going to be?

37:11.815 --> 37:12.981
Colonel.

37:12.982 --> 37:14.550
Sergeant.

37:29.366 --> 37:32.936
You want to stay here out of
obligation to these people.

37:32.937 --> 37:34.037
To protect them.

37:34.038 --> 37:37.540
I can respect that, but there
are people back on the ship

37:37.541 --> 37:38.875
who don't have a choice,

37:38.876 --> 37:42.512
and you have an obligation
to them as well, Lieutenant.

37:43.714 --> 37:46.783
TJ, they need you.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.700
Welcome home.

39:11.570 --> 39:14.639
Well, as predicted,

39:14.640 --> 39:16.608
we've corrected our course

39:16.609 --> 39:18.510
and jumped back into FTL.

39:18.511 --> 39:20.779
I'm sorry you didn't get your wish.

39:22.715 --> 39:23.882
And what wish was that?

39:23.883 --> 39:28.653
Aliens advanced enough that
they could build a star system.

39:28.654 --> 39:31.923
Finally somebody you could
have a decent conversation with.

39:36.395 --> 39:38.029
I...

39:38.030 --> 39:39.397
I enjoy chess.

39:49.843 --> 39:52.545
Colonel, do you have a moment?

39:52.546 --> 39:53.779
Can it wait?

39:53.780 --> 39:55.414
I wanted to better explain my reasons

39:55.415 --> 39:57.616
for choosing to stay behind.

39:57.617 --> 40:01.620
Look, I realize you're probably
not hungry, Lieutenant, but I am.

40:01.621 --> 40:02.788
I hear they're serving
up a feast in the mess,

40:02.789 --> 40:04.590
so why don't we talk about it later?

40:04.591 --> 40:05.591
Sir...

40:05.592 --> 40:07.760
Later.

40:07.761 --> 40:09.061
What if we were meant to stay there?

40:09.062 --> 40:12.531
All of us?

40:12.532 --> 40:20.206
What if that planet was a
lifeline, and we just let it go?

40:22.042 --> 40:25.711
I can't pretend to answer that, Matthew.

40:25.712 --> 40:26.946
No one can.
