WEBVTT

01:08.611 --> 01:11.447
Your son has arrived
from London, sir.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.744
Father.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.371
John. John-

01:20.831 --> 01:24.085
You will find out soon enough
from my will...

01:24.168 --> 01:27.088
that the estate of Norland
was left to me...

01:27.171 --> 01:30.091
in such a way as prevents me...

01:30.174 --> 01:33.094
from dividing it
between my two families.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.304
Calm yourself, Father.
This cannot be good for you.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.766
Norland, in its entirety,

01:38.849 --> 01:43.104
is therefore yours by law,

01:43.187 --> 01:47.108
and I am happy for you...

01:47.191 --> 01:49.360
and Fanny.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.530
But your stepmother,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.116
my wife and daughters,

01:59.537 --> 02:02.039
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.628
You must help them.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.172
O-Of course.

02:10.256 --> 02:13.551
You must promise to do this.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.930
I promise, Father.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.307
I promise.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.978
"Help them"?
What do you mean, "help them"?

02:27.398 --> 02:31.068
The interest will provide them
with a little extra income.

02:31.152 --> 02:35.322
Such a gift will certainly
discharge my promise to my father.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.908
Without question.
More than amply.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.077
One had rather,
on such occasions,

02:40.161 --> 02:43.080
do too much than too little.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.586
Of course he did not
stipulate a particular sum.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.050
What do you say to 1,500?

02:55.134 --> 02:58.512
What brother on earth would do
half so much for his real sisters,

02:58.596 --> 03:00.431
let alone half-blood?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.308
Well, they can hardly
expect more.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.101
There's no knowing
what they expect.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.854
The question is,
what can you afford?

03:09.440 --> 03:12.526
A hundred pounds a year
to their mother, while she lives.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.195
Would that be more advisable?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.947
It is better than parting
with the 1,500 all at once.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.450
But if she should live
longer than 15 years,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.577
we'd be completely taken in.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.748
People always live forever when there
is an annuity to be paid them.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.689
Twenty pounds now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're quite right.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.632
Indeed.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.943
Although, to say the truth,
I'm convinced within myself...

03:36.967 --> 03:40.012
that your father had no idea
of your giving them money.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.015
They will have 500 a year
amongst them as it is.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.018
And what on earth could four
women want for more than that?

03:46.101 --> 03:48.020
Their housekeeping
will be nothing at all.

03:48.103 --> 03:52.024
They'll have no carriage, no horses, hardly
any servants and will keep no company.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.693
Only conceive
how comfortable they will be.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.905
They will be much more able
to give <i>you</i> something.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.556
Marianne, can you play
something else?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.559
Mama has been weeping
since breakfast.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.739
I meant something
less mournful, dearest.

04:42.825 --> 04:46.120
To be reduced to the condition
of visitor in my own home.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.123
It is not to be borne, Elinor.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.126
Consider, Mama,
we have nowhere to go.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.753
John and Fanny will be descending
from London at any moment.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.089
Do you expect me to
be here to welcome them?

04:57.172 --> 04:58.674
Vultures!

05:12.396 --> 05:15.816
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.447
Until then we must try
to bear their coming.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.411
Margaret, are you there?
Please come down.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.414
John and Fanny
will be here soon.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.335
Why are they coming
to live at Norland?

05:34.418 --> 05:37.046
They already have
a house in London.

05:37.129 --> 05:42.092
Because houses go from father to son,
dearest, not from father to daughter.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.094
It is the law.

05:44.178 --> 05:48.098
If you come inside,
we could play with your atlas.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.685
It's not my atlas anymore.
It's <i>their</i> atlas.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.277
Do sit down.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.448
As you know,
we are looking for a new home.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.702
And when we leave we shall be able
to retain only Thomas and Betsy.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.248
We are very sorry
to have to leave you all,

06:13.332 --> 06:16.752
but we are certain that you will
find the new Mrs. Dashwood...

06:16.835 --> 06:19.088
a fair and generous mistress.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.760
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.867
How is Mrs. Ferrars?

06:48.951 --> 06:52.329
My mother is always
in excellent health, thank you.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.957
My brother Robert is
in town with her this season...

06:55.040 --> 06:57.459
and quite the most popular
bachelor in London.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.003
He has his own barouche.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.592
You have two brothers,
have you not?

07:05.676 --> 07:09.596
Indeed, yes. Edward is the elder.
Mama quite depends upon him.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.142
He's traveling up from Plymouth shortly
and will break his journey here.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.233
If that is agreeable to you,
of course.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.235
My dear John,

07:24.570 --> 07:26.530
this is your home now.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.329
Fanny wishes to know where the key
to the silver cabinet is kept.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.124
Betsy has it, I think. What does
Fanny want with the silver?

07:37.207 --> 07:40.544
One can only presume
she wants to count it.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.797
What are you doing?
Presents for the servants.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.884
Have you seen Margaret, by the way?
I'm worried about her.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.137
She's taken to hiding in the oddest places.
Fortunate girl.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.223
At least she can escape Fanny,
which is more than any of us is able.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.143
You do your best. You've not
said a word to her for a week.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.686
I have.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.730
I've said "yes" and "no."

08:13.785 --> 08:15.746
Good morning, Fanny.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.375
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

08:21.418 --> 08:25.005
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

08:25.088 --> 08:29.676
Pray, when may we expect the
pleasure of your brother's company?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.553
Edward is due tomorrow.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.014
And my dear
Mrs. Dashwood,

08:34.097 --> 08:36.975
in view of the fact that
he will not be with us for long,

08:37.058 --> 08:40.270
I wonder if Miss Margaret will be
prepared to give up her room for him.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.397
The view is quite incomparable
from her windows,

08:42.481 --> 08:46.693
and I should so much like Edward
to see Norland at its best.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.970
Mrs. Dashwood, Miss
Dashwood, Miss Marianne,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.180
my brother Edward Ferrars.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.725
Do sit down-

09:22.271 --> 09:24.648
But where is Miss Margaret?

09:24.731 --> 09:28.531
I declare, Mrs. Dashwood, I'm beginning to doubt
of her existence. She must run positively wild.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.989
Pray, forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My
youngest is not to be found this morning.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.658
She's a little shy
of strangers at present.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.661
N-N-Naturally.

09:37.744 --> 09:42.416
I'm shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.419
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.923
Very much.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.885
Your stables are very handsome
and beautifully kept, Mrs. Dashwood.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.598
Stables?
Edward, your windows overlook the lake.

09:57.681 --> 10:01.685
A-An oversight, Fanny, had led
me to one of the family rooms,

10:01.768 --> 10:05.105
but I've rectified the situation
and am very happily installed...

10:05.188 --> 10:07.357
in the guest quarters.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.569
Tea.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.781
They're all exceedingly
spoilt, I find.

10:14.865 --> 10:18.952
Miss Margaret spends all her time
up trees and under furniture.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.456
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.792
My dear Fanny, they've
just lost their father.

10:25.876 --> 10:29.296
Their lives will never
be the same again.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.298
That is no excuse.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.554
Library.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.434
These are mostly foreign.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.188
Indeed.
Magnificent.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.357
Never liked the smell of books.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.653
No, well, it is-
it is the dust, perhaps.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.281
I hear you have great plans
for the walnut grove.

10:56.365 --> 11:00.327
Yes. I shall have it knocked down
to make way for a Grecian temple.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.538
That does sound
extremely interesting.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.582
Would you show me the site?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.549
Too expensive.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.928
And we do not need four bedrooms.
We can share.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.931
This one then.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.022
I will send out
more inquiries today.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.237
Pardon my intrusion, but, um,

11:35.320 --> 11:39.282
I think I may have found,
what you were looking for.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.622
Sorry.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.169
Won't you come out, dearest?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.171
We haven't seen you all day.

11:53.255 --> 11:56.174
So later, of course,
we shall have to enlarge it.

11:56.258 --> 12:00.220
Mama is very concerned.
And Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.726
Miss Dashwood.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.728
Forgive me.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.732
Do you, by any chance, have such
a thing as a reliable atlas?

12:11.815 --> 12:13.442
I believe so.

12:13.525 --> 12:17.070
Excellent. I, wish to check
the position of the Nile.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.782
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.912
No. No.

12:25.996 --> 12:31.418
Um, she's quite wrong, um, for
I believe it is in Belgium.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.588
Belgium.
Surely not, I-

12:34.671 --> 12:37.424
I think you must be thinking
of the Volga. The Volga?

12:37.507 --> 12:42.721
Of course. The Volga, which, as you know,
starts in- Vladivostok, and ends in-

12:42.804 --> 12:45.932
Wimbledon. Precisely. Where
the coffee beans come from.

12:46.016 --> 12:50.854
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia!

12:50.937 --> 12:52.856
Is it?

12:54.316 --> 12:56.735
How interesting.
How do you do?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.404
Edward Ferrars.
Margaret Dashwood.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.740
Delighted to make
your acquaintance.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.742
It immediately adjoins this property.
Quite so?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.745
It cannot be but a most
desirable addition.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.248
I will ride there tomorrow
and speak to- who is it?

13:10.332 --> 13:12.250
Gibson.
Gibson.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.045
He ought to be pleased
to sell, no doubt.

13:15.128 --> 13:19.049
He will certainly ask for more than it is worth.
Do not be too eager.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.301
No, no, you're quite right.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.471
We have no desire
to lose it to somebody else.

13:24.554 --> 13:29.142
- I'll go tomorrow as planned.
- Merely inquire.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.812
- Like this?
- Yes.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.314
After all, there'll be
few enough offers.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.900
- The land thereabout is marshy.
- Lunge!

13:36.983 --> 13:39.486
Here!

13:39.569 --> 13:43.782
It's possible we may
get some assistance from Mama.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.744
She mentioned in her letter
a gift she made to Robert.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.747
- Ooh.
- Did I hurt you?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.791
No, no.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.980
Thank you.
Forgive me.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.318
That was my father's favorite.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.197
No-

15:06.281 --> 15:08.909
Thank you so much for your help
with Margaret, Mr. Ferrars.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.411
She's quite changed
since you came.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.414
Not at all.
I enjoy her company.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.417
Has she shown you the tree house?
Not yet.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.587
W-Would-

15:20.670 --> 15:22.839
Would you do me the honor,
Miss Dashwood?

15:24.174 --> 15:26.593
It is very fine out.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.762
With pleasure.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.099
Margaret has always
wanted to travel.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.602
I know. She's heading an
expedition to China shortly.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.270
I am to go as her servant,

15:37.354 --> 15:39.940
but only on the understanding
that I will be very badly treated.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.610
What will your duties be?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.612
Sword fighting, obviously,

15:45.695 --> 15:47.614
administering rum
and... swabbing.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.284
Which of those duties will
take precedence for you?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.495
The swabbing, I would imagine.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.003
All I want-

16:02.087 --> 16:04.714
All I have ever wanted is
the quiet of a private life.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.717
But, my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.970
As?
Anything.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.473
Um, a great orator,
a leading politician.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.893
I think even a barrister would serve,
as long as I drove a barouche...

16:16.977 --> 16:18.478
and dined in the first circle.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.480
What do <i>you</i> wish for?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.234
I've always preferred the church.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.696
But that is not smart enough for my mother.
She prefers the army.

16:27.779 --> 16:31.282
But that is a great deal
too smart for me.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.369
Would you stay in London?
I hate London.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.747
No peace.
Country living is my ideal.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.750
A small parish
where I might do some good,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.753
keep chickens,
give very short sermons.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.429
You talk of feeling
idle and useless.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.807
Imagine how that is compounded
when one has no hope...

16:55.890 --> 16:59.477
and no choice of any
occupation whatsoever.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.065
Our circumstances are,
therefore, precisely the same.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.569
Except that you will
inherit your fortune.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.906
We cannot even earn ours.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.871
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Right?

17:17.954 --> 17:20.915
Piracy <i>is</i> our only option.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.046
What is swabbing, exactly?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.049
"No voice divine
the storm allayed,

17:29.132 --> 17:31.051
no light propitious shone.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.303
When snatched
from all effectual aid...

17:33.386 --> 17:36.222
we perished-
perished each alone.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.975
But I beneath a rougher sea...

17:39.059 --> 17:42.479
and whelmed
in deeper gulfs than he."

17:42.562 --> 17:44.522
No, Edward, listen.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.358
No voice divine
the storm allayed,

17:47.442 --> 17:50.070
no light propitious shone.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.238
When snatched
from all effectual aid...

17:52.322 --> 17:54.365
we perished, each alone.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.910
Can you not feel his despair?

17:56.993 --> 17:59.746
Try again.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.587
"No voice divine the
storm allayed- Divine-

18:07.670 --> 18:11.174
Light... propitious shone.
no light propitious shone.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.177
When snatched from all effectual
<i>aid-</i> Snatched from all effectual-

18:14.260 --> 18:17.055
we perished, each alone."
We perished, each alone.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.351
Mama!

18:24.646 --> 18:27.649
Look.
This has just arrived.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.612
"I should be pleased to offer
you a home at Barton Cottage...

18:32.695 --> 18:35.115
as soon as ever
you have need."

18:35.198 --> 18:37.283
It's from my cousin,
Sir John Middleton.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.619
Even Elinor
must approve the rent.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.622
Has Elinor not yet seen this?
No. I will fetch her.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.625
Wait. No.
Let us delay.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.418
Why?

18:47.502 --> 18:50.505
I think-
I believe that...

18:50.588 --> 18:53.508
Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.470
It would be cruel to take her away so soon.
Devonshire is so far.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.183
Why so grave? Do you
disapprove her choice?

19:02.267 --> 19:04.185
By no means.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.521
Edward is very amiable.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.524
Amiable? But?

19:09.607 --> 19:12.026
But there is something wanting.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.530
He's too sedate.
His reading last night-

19:15.613 --> 19:18.950
But Elinor has not your feelings.
His reserve suits her.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.952
Can he love her?

19:21.035 --> 19:24.831
Can the soul really be satisfied
with such polite affections?

19:24.914 --> 19:27.834
To love is to burn,
to be on fire,

19:27.917 --> 19:30.420
like Juliet
or Guinevere or Eloise.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.631
They met rather pathetic ends, dear.
Pathetic?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.216
To die for love?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.760
How can you say so?
What could be more glorious?

19:37.844 --> 19:41.639
I think that may be taking your
romantic sensibilities a little far.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.649
"Is love a fancy or a feeling?

19:51.733 --> 19:55.570
No, it is immortal
as immaculate truth.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.866
'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as
youth drops from the stem of life,

19:59.949 --> 20:03.578
for it will grow in barren
regions where no waters flow...

20:03.661 --> 20:06.873
nor ray of promise
cheats the pensive gloom."

20:10.293 --> 20:12.837
What a pity it is that Edward
has no passion for reading.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.049
It was you who asked him to read,
then you made him nervous.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.092
Me?
Yes.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.847
But since your behavior to him in all
other respects is perfectly cordial,

20:22.931 --> 20:26.726
I must assume that you like him
in spite of his deficiencies.

20:26.809 --> 20:30.021
I think him... everything...

20:30.104 --> 20:32.523
that is amiable and worthy.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.569
Praise indeed.

20:36.653 --> 20:41.574
But he shall have my unswerving devotion when
you tell me that he is to be my brother.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.869
How shall I do without you?

20:44.953 --> 20:48.665
Do without me? I'm sure
you will be very happy.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.668
But you must promise not
to live too far away.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.587
Marianne, there is no question
of- That is, there is-

20:54.671 --> 20:57.006
There is no understanding.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.008
Do you love him?

21:02.178 --> 21:06.432
I do not attempt to deny that I think...
very highly of him,

21:06.516 --> 21:08.434
that I...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.854
greatly esteem him.

21:13.147 --> 21:16.651
I like him. "Esteem him"?
"Like him"?

21:16.734 --> 21:19.570
Use those insipid words again and I
shall leave the room this instant.

21:19.654 --> 21:24.284
Very well, forgive me. Believe my feelings
to be stronger than I have declared.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.078
But further than that
you must not believe.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.625
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

21:32.709 --> 21:34.419
Or a Ferrars?

21:34.502 --> 21:36.379
Go to bed.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.633
"I do not attempt
to deny that...

21:40.717 --> 21:42.719
I think very highly of him,

21:42.802 --> 21:44.721
that I...

21:44.804 --> 21:47.515
greatly esteem him,

21:49.392 --> 21:51.477
that I <i>like</i> him."

22:11.331 --> 22:16.002
We're so happy that you chose
to invite Edward to Norland.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.505
He's a dear boy.
We're all very fond of him.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.507
We have great hopes for him.

22:21.591 --> 22:24.927
Much is expected of him by our mother
with regard to his profession.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.930
Naturally.
And in marriage.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.933
She's determined that both he
and Robert will marry well.

22:31.017 --> 22:35.646
Of course. But I hope she
desires them to marry for love.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.067
Love is all very well, but...

22:39.150 --> 22:41.694
unfortunately we cannot
always rely on the heart...

22:41.778 --> 22:44.072
to lead us in the most
suitable directions.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.325
You see,
my dear Mrs. Dashwood,

22:47.408 --> 22:50.328
Edward is entirely the kind
of compassionate person...

22:50.411 --> 22:52.705
upon whom
penniless women can prey.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.541
And having entered
into any understanding,

22:55.625 --> 22:57.668
he would never
go back on his word.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.171
He's simply incapable
of doing so.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.673
But it would lead to his ruin.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.301
I worry for him so,
Mrs. Dashwood.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.196
My mother has always
made it perfectly plain...

23:07.220 --> 23:09.580
that she would withdraw
all financial support from Edward...

23:09.639 --> 23:11.682
should he choose
to plant his affections...

23:11.766 --> 23:15.186
in less... exalted ground
than he deserves.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.941
I understand you perfectly.

23:25.154 --> 23:28.741
To Devonshire? My cousin,
Sir John Middleton,

23:28.825 --> 23:31.160
has offered us
a small house on his estate.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.704
Sir John Middleton?

23:33.788 --> 23:36.416
What is his situation? He must
be a man of some property?

23:36.499 --> 23:39.836
He is a widower. He lives with his
mother-in-law at Barton Park.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.089
- It is Barton Cottage that he offers us.
- A cottage.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.092
How charming. A little
cottage is always very snug.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.428
But-

23:48.511 --> 23:51.097
Y-You will not leave
before the summer.

23:51.180 --> 23:54.100
My dear Edward, we can no longer
trespass upon your sister's good will.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.727
We must leave
as soon as possible.

23:56.811 --> 24:01.524
- You will come and stay with us, Edward?
- I should like that very much.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.277
Edward has long been expected
in town by our mother.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.904
Come as soon as you can, Edward.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.949
Remember, you're always welcome.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.811
Cannot you take him with you?

24:38.895 --> 24:41.189
We cannot possibly afford him.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.818
Then perhaps he can make
himself useful in the kitchen.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.071
Forgive me.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.744
Miss Dashwood-

24:57.413 --> 24:59.373
Elinor-

25:00.583 --> 25:02.543
I must speak to you.

25:06.964 --> 25:11.093
There is something of great importance
that I need to...

25:12.720 --> 25:15.348
t-tell you...

25:15.431 --> 25:18.392
about my, education.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.648
Your education?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.858
Yes.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.694
It was conducted, um,

25:28.778 --> 25:31.489
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.868
- Indeed.
- Yes. Do you know it?

25:35.952 --> 25:37.286
- Plymouth?
- Yes.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.498
- No.
- Well-

25:41.582 --> 25:44.043
I was four years there,
um-

25:44.126 --> 25:47.630
in a school,
r-run by Mr. Pratt.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.053
Pratt?
Precisely, yes.

25:54.136 --> 25:57.598
Pratt. And...

25:57.682 --> 25:59.892
while I was there-

25:59.976 --> 26:02.853
That is to say,
he ha- he had a-

26:02.937 --> 26:04.480
<i>has</i> a, um-

26:04.564 --> 26:07.024
Edward! Edward!

26:07.817 --> 26:10.111
Edward, I've been
all over for you.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.071
You're needed in London
this instant.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.700
I'm leaving this afternoon as it is.
No, no, that will not do.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.703
Mama is quite adamant
you should leave at once.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.623
Excuse me.

26:55.072 --> 26:59.076
- Edward promised he'd bring the atlas to Barton for me.
- Did he?

27:00.953 --> 27:04.665
Well, I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.877
Dear Edward.

27:28.648 --> 27:32.318
Hello there, now! Welcome!
Mrs. Dashwood!

27:32.401 --> 27:34.820
Welcome, you poor creatures!
Yoo-hoo!

27:34.904 --> 27:38.282
There! Do you see? Just as I tell you.
There they are!

27:38.366 --> 27:40.951
- Sir John.
- How very kind.

27:47.208 --> 27:50.628
Here- Here we are! Dear ladies!
Dear ladies!

27:50.711 --> 27:54.298
Upon my word,
here ye are, here ye are!

27:54.382 --> 27:58.427
Sir John, your extraordinary
kindness- No, none of that!

27:58.511 --> 28:00.429
Hush, please.
None of that.

28:00.513 --> 28:04.475
But here is my dear
mama-in-law, Mrs. Jennings.

28:04.558 --> 28:08.145
Now get down, dogs! This
must be Miss Dashwood.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.773
Was your journey tolerable?
You poor souls!

28:10.856 --> 28:14.276
Why did ye not come up to the
Park first and take her in?

28:14.360 --> 28:18.280
We saw you pass. I could not
wait for you to come to us!

28:18.364 --> 28:20.783
I made John call a carriage!
Get down, you dog!

28:20.866 --> 28:23.452
She would not wait, you know.
We've had so little company!

28:23.536 --> 28:27.790
But I feel as if
I know you already.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.292
Delightful creatures! Are
they not delightful?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.629
And you know you must dine
at Barton Park every day.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.799
My dear Sir John, we cannot possibly.
No, no, no, no, no!

28:36.882 --> 28:40.302
I would not brook refusals.
I'm quite deaf to them, you know?

28:40.386 --> 28:43.305
Deaf to them!
But I insist!

28:43.389 --> 28:47.476
Let us settle in for a few days, but thank you so very much.
No, no.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.895
No thanks, I beg you.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.898
I could not bear it.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.861
I declare!

28:56.944 --> 28:59.864
They are the loveliest
girls I ever set eyes on!

28:59.947 --> 29:02.867
Can you not get them married, Mrs.
Dashwood?

29:02.950 --> 29:04.869
You must not leave it
any longer.

29:04.952 --> 29:08.372
Alas, there are no smart young
men here about to woo them.

29:08.456 --> 29:12.376
Not a beau for miles.
Come, Mama, Let us leave them in peace.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.046
And send your man up to us for the
carriage as soon as you're ready!

29:16.130 --> 29:18.340
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

29:18.424 --> 29:21.844
No, don't thank us! Good day to you!
Good-bye!

29:21.927 --> 29:24.013
Here you are!

29:24.096 --> 29:27.016
Come on, boys. Come on.
Come along.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.073
Your feet are cold.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.476
What have you been doing?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.479
Your neck is so dirty
you could grow a potato on it.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.441
It's cold. I'm cold.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.443
Hot. Thank you, Elinor.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.445
It's hot.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.492
How do you manage it, Margaret?

30:28.577 --> 30:30.496
Where can Brandon be?

30:30.579 --> 30:33.499
Poor fellow. I hope he's
not lamed his horse.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.919
Colonel Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.505
Yes, indeed.
He's bound to do for one of you.

30:39.588 --> 30:43.175
Mind, I think he's a better
age for Miss Dashwood.

30:45.094 --> 30:48.264
But I dare say, she's left
her heart behind in Sussex?

30:48.347 --> 30:52.226
Ho-ho!
I see you, Miss Marianne.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.687
I think I've unearthed a secret.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.690
Sniffed one out already? You're worse
than my best pointer, Flossie!

30:59.358 --> 31:02.027
What sort of man is he,
Miss Dashwood?

31:02.111 --> 31:05.197
Butcher? Baker?
Candlestick maker?

31:05.281 --> 31:08.951
- I shall winkle it out of you, you know.
- She's horribly good at winkling.

31:09.034 --> 31:13.205
You're in lonely country now, Miss Dashwood.
We none of us have any secrets here.

31:13.289 --> 31:17.710
- Or if we do,
we do not keep them long.

31:17.793 --> 31:22.548
- He's curate of the parish, I dare say.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.802
- Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.388
No profession.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.390
He's a gentleman, then.

31:31.473 --> 31:35.853
Margaret, you know perfectly
well there is no such person.

31:35.936 --> 31:39.189
There is! There is, and his
name begins with an "F."

31:39.273 --> 31:42.651
- Margaret!
- - An "F" indeed!

31:42.735 --> 31:46.322
- There's a promising letter. Let me-"F," "F."
- Foster?

31:46.405 --> 31:49.241
- There's one!
- Forrest? Fotheringay?

31:49.325 --> 31:52.536
- Foggarty?
- Yes, I- I- Fortescue!

31:52.620 --> 31:55.080
Fondant?

31:55.164 --> 31:59.585
Sir John, might I play
your pianoforte?

31:59.668 --> 32:02.504
Yes, yes, of course.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.256
My goodness.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.551
Yes, we do not stand
upon ceremony here, my dear.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.553
Sir John, please forgive her.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.555
An entertainment!
I declare!

32:11.639 --> 32:14.767
I cannot remember when we last
had a songbird in the house.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.347
Wasn't that love-

33:35.431 --> 33:37.349
Brandon, where have you been?

33:37.433 --> 33:39.977
Come, come and meet our
beautiful new neighbors!

33:40.060 --> 33:42.354
But what a pity
you're late, Colonel.

33:42.438 --> 33:46.316
You have not heard our delightful
songbird Miss Marianne.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.777
A great pleasure indeed.

33:48.861 --> 33:52.031
Mrs. Dashwood, may I present my
dear friend Colonel Brandon.

33:52.114 --> 33:56.785
We served in the East Indies together. I assure
you there's not a better fellow in the world.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.372
- Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel?
- I have.

34:00.456 --> 34:03.959
- What's it like?
- Like? Hot.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.837
The air is full of spices.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.547
How lovely.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.634
Now, Miss Dashwood,
it's your turn to entertain us.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.387
No, Sir John,
I don't-

34:15.471 --> 34:19.183
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in:

34:19.266 --> 34:21.185
F Major.

34:34.406 --> 34:38.577
And as for you, you have no right to
parade your ignorant assumptions-

34:38.659 --> 34:41.163
They're not assumptions.
You told me.

34:42.664 --> 34:46.710
I told you nothing. They'll
meet him when he comes anyway.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.422
Margaret, that is not the point. You do not
speak of such things before strangers.

34:50.505 --> 34:54.176
But everyone else was. Mrs.
Jennings is not everyone.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.346
I like her.
She talks about things.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.724
- We never talk about things.
- Hush, please.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.726
That is enough, Margaret.

35:02.810 --> 35:07.356
If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say,
you will please restrict your remarks to the weather.

35:10.484 --> 35:13.904
Surely they've got enough reeds
for a Moses basket by now.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.115
Mama! We've got lots!

35:18.909 --> 35:22.121
Wrap your string around this.
Good and tight.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.581
I know tight.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.445
You know what they're
saying, of course.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.201
Word is, you've developed a
taste for certain company.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.203
And why not, say I?

36:03.287 --> 36:05.706
A man like you in his prime?

36:05.789 --> 36:08.208
She'd be a very fortunate
young lady.

36:08.292 --> 36:12.212
Marianne Dashwood would no more think
of me than she would of you, John.

36:12.296 --> 36:15.215
Brandon, my boy, do not think
of yourself so meanly.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.759
And all the better for her.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.444
Very good.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.446
Casper.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.573
No, Casper!

36:41.867 --> 36:43.785
No.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.040
Besotted.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.042
An excellent match.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.294
For he's rich
and she's handsome.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.713
How long have you
known the colonel?

36:54.796 --> 36:57.966
Lord bless you, as long
as ever I've been here,

36:58.050 --> 37:00.469
and I came 15 years back.

37:00.552 --> 37:05.474
His estate at Delaford is but four miles
hence, and he and John are very thick.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.727
He has no wife and children,
for he-

37:08.810 --> 37:10.729
he had a tragic history.

37:10.812 --> 37:14.733
He loved a girl once,
20 years ago now.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.861
A ward to his family.
But they were not permitted to marry.

37:17.945 --> 37:21.490
- On what grounds?
- Money. Eliza was poor.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.825
When the father
discovered their <i>amour,</i>

37:23.909 --> 37:27.246
she was flung out of the house and
he was packed up into the army.

37:27.329 --> 37:30.290
I think he would've
done himself a harm if not for John.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.378
What became of the lady?

37:34.461 --> 37:37.381
She was passed from man to man.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.675
Disappeared from all good society.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.678
When Brandon
came back from India,

37:42.761 --> 37:44.846
he searched
heaven knows how long,

37:44.930 --> 37:48.267
only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.895
Once I thought my daughter
Charlotte might've cheered him up.

37:51.979 --> 37:54.731
But she's better off
where she is.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.526
But look at him now.

37:57.609 --> 38:01.071
So attentive.

38:01.154 --> 38:04.700
Well done!
I think I shall try a little experiment on him.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.786
No. Mrs. Jennings,
please leave the poor colonel alone.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.748
No, no, my dear. It's just the thing.
All suitors need a little help.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.750
Colonel Brandon!

38:13.834 --> 38:16.753
We have not heard you
play for us of late.

38:16.837 --> 38:20.132
There's a simple reason, that you
have a far superior musician here.

38:20.215 --> 38:24.469
Perhaps you did not know, Miss Marianne, that
our dear Brandon shares your passion for music.

38:24.553 --> 38:27.723
He plays a pianoforte very well.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.725
Come.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.604
I trow you know as many melancholy
tunes as Miss Marianne.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.606
You must play us a duet!

38:36.690 --> 38:40.235
Let us see you both
side by side.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.821
I do not know any duets.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.865
Forgive me, Colonel.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.707
Are we never
to have a moment's peace?

38:53.790 --> 38:57.002
The rent here may be low, but I believe
we have it on very hard terms.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.005
Mrs. Jennings is a wealthy
woman with a married daughter.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.008
She has nothing to do
but marry off everyone else's.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.427
There's a parcel arrived for you, Mrs.
Dashwood.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.429
A parcel?
Look!

39:07.512 --> 39:10.432
When did it arrive? While
you were up at the Park.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.851
Can I open it?
It is too ridiculous.

39:12.934 --> 39:16.688
When is a man to be safe from such wit,
if age and infirmity do not protect him?

39:16.772 --> 39:19.858
- Infirmity?
- If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I am at death's door.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.319
It is a miracle your life
has extended this far.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.863
Did you not hear him complain
of a rheumatism in his shoulder?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.532
"A slight ache"
I believe was his phrase.

39:32.579 --> 39:36.458
But Edward said
he would bring it himself.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.547
"Dear Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret,

39:42.631 --> 39:46.343
it gives me great pleasure to restore
this atlas to its rightful owner.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.888
Alas, business in London does
not permit me to accompany it,

39:49.971 --> 39:52.891
although this is likely to hurt
me far more than it hurts you.

39:52.974 --> 39:56.395
For the present my memories of your
kindness must be enough to sustain me...

39:56.478 --> 40:00.607
and I remain your devoted
servant always, E.C. Ferrars."

40:01.608 --> 40:03.777
Why hasn't he come?

40:03.860 --> 40:05.654
He says he's busy, dear.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.782
He said he'd come.
Why hasn't he come?

40:08.865 --> 40:12.160
I'm taking you for a walk.
No, I've been a walk.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.287
You need another.
It's going to rain.

40:14.371 --> 40:18.458
It is not going to rain. You always
say that and then it always does.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.629
I fear Mrs. Jennings
is a bad influence.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.972
You must miss him, Elinor.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.267
We are not engaged, Mama.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.522
But he loves you, dearest.
Of that I am certain.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.400
I am, by no means, assured of
his regard for me. Elinor-

40:43.483 --> 40:45.527
But even were he to feel
such a preference,

40:45.610 --> 40:49.531
I think we should be foolish to assume
that there would not be many obstacles...

40:49.614 --> 40:54.035
to his marrying a- a woman of no
rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.538
But, Elinor,
your heart must tell you-

40:56.621 --> 41:00.041
In such a situation, Mama, it is
perhaps better to use one's head.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.635
This can't be good for me.

41:10.719 --> 41:13.638
It's very good for you.
Stop complaining.

41:13.722 --> 41:16.641
It's giving me a cough. It
is <i>not</i> giving you a cough.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.643
Please, can we go back?

41:18.727 --> 41:21.646
It's lovely. Come on.
Catch up! Catch up!

41:24.065 --> 41:25.984
Just over
that fence-

41:26.067 --> 41:27.986
there's a field full of rabbits.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.405
I don't want to see rabbits.
Yes, you do.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.997
Is there any felicity in the world
superior to this?

41:39.080 --> 41:42.918
I told you it would rain! There's
some blue sky! Let us chase it!

41:43.418 --> 41:45.253
I'm not supposed to run.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.925
Aaah!
Marianne!

41:50.008 --> 41:52.427
Are you hurt?

41:52.511 --> 41:54.429
Aaah!

41:56.515 --> 41:59.184
Margaret, I do not
think I can walk.

41:59.267 --> 42:02.604
- You must run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

42:12.405 --> 42:15.534
Margaret!

42:15.617 --> 42:18.036
Margaret!

42:21.915 --> 42:26.503
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.

42:31.174 --> 42:34.344
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

42:35.512 --> 42:38.682
May I have your permission
to ascertain if there are any breaks?

42:58.994 --> 43:01.246
It is not broken.

43:01.329 --> 43:04.666
Now, can you put your arm
about my neck?

43:08.336 --> 43:10.755
Allow me to escort you home.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.721
At last.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.683
She fell over! She fell
down and he's carrying her!

43:21.766 --> 43:23.268
What?

43:24.644 --> 43:27.606
- Marianne, are you all right?
- My darling.

43:27.689 --> 43:29.608
It's a twisted ankle.

43:29.691 --> 43:32.611
Do not be alarmed, Mama. I can
assure you it's not serious.

43:32.694 --> 43:35.780
I took the liberty of feeling the
bone and it's perfectly sound.

43:35.864 --> 43:38.783
Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you.
Please do not think of it.

43:38.867 --> 43:41.077
I am honored to be of service.

43:41.161 --> 43:45.457
- Will you not be seated?
- Excuse me, I have no desire to leave a watermark.

43:45.540 --> 43:49.461
But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon
and inquire after the patient?

43:49.544 --> 43:51.755
We sh-We shall
look forward to it.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.674
You're most kind. Thank you.
I'll show you out.

43:56.676 --> 43:59.846
Margaret, give the gentleman his hat.
Thank you.

44:01.473 --> 44:04.643
His name! His name!
His name.

44:04.726 --> 44:07.687
Please, could you tell us to
whom we are so much obliged?

44:07.771 --> 44:10.732
John Willoughby of Allenham,
at your service, ma'am.

44:10.815 --> 44:14.194
John Willoughby of Allenham.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.531
What an impressive gentleman.

44:19.407 --> 44:22.452
He lifted me as if I weighed
no more than a dried leaf.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.663
Is he human?

44:24.746 --> 44:27.165
Tell me if I hurt you.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.751
She feels no pain, Mama.

44:29.834 --> 44:33.922
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold
compress, please, quickly as you can.

44:34.005 --> 44:37.425
Please don't say anything important.
Go on, go on.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.302
Betsy!
Did you see him?

44:39.386 --> 44:40.970
He expressed himself well,
did he not?

44:41.054 --> 44:44.307
With great decorum and honor.
And spirit and wit and feeling.

44:44.391 --> 44:47.477
- And economy. Ten words at most.
- Wait for me!

44:47.560 --> 44:50.939
- And he is to come tomorrow.
- Marianne, you must change. You will catch a cold.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.274
What care I for colds
when there is such a man?

44:53.358 --> 44:55.527
You will care very much
when your nose swells up.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.612
You are right.
Help me, Elinor.

45:00.615 --> 45:03.368
Mr. Willoughby's well
worth catching, Miss Dashwood.

45:03.451 --> 45:06.871
Miss Marianne must not expect
to have all the men to herself.

45:06.955 --> 45:10.917
- But what do you know of Mr. Willoughby, Sir John?
- Decent shot.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.796
- And there's not a bolder rider in all England.
- But what is he like?

45:14.879 --> 45:18.717
- "Like"?
- What are his tastes, his passions, his pursuits?

45:20.218 --> 45:22.137
Well,

45:22.220 --> 45:25.724
he has the smartest
little bitch of a pointer.

45:25.807 --> 45:29.352
- Was she out with him yesterday?
- Where is Allenham, Sir John?

45:29.436 --> 45:31.980
Allenham? Nice little
estate three miles east.

45:32.063 --> 45:35.066
He's to inherit it
from an elderly relative.

45:35.150 --> 45:38.111
Lady Allen's the name.

45:43.450 --> 45:47.704
It's Colonel Brandon. I shall
go outside and keep watch.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.582
Hello, Colonel!

45:50.665 --> 45:53.918
You're all on the lookout for Willoughby?
Dear me, poor Brandon.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.421
You will none of you
think of him now?

45:56.504 --> 45:58.423
Come in.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.635
- Colonel.
- Good morning, Brandon.

46:02.719 --> 46:06.306
Good morning.
How's the invalid?

46:06.389 --> 46:08.767
Thank you so much, Colonel.

46:08.850 --> 46:11.227
Elinor, would you-
Miss Marianne,

46:11.311 --> 46:13.897
I cannot think why you should
set your cap at Willoughby...

46:13.980 --> 46:17.150
when you've already made
such a splendid conquest.

46:17.233 --> 46:20.528
I have no intention of setting
my cap at anyone, Sir John.

46:20.612 --> 46:23.114
Mr. Willoughby,
Lady Allen's nephew?

46:23.198 --> 46:25.617
Aye, he visits every year,
for he's to inherit.

46:25.700 --> 46:31.122
Um, and he has a very pretty estate
of his own, you know, Miss Dashwood.

46:31.206 --> 46:33.958
Combe Magna in Somerset.

46:34.042 --> 46:38.296
Aye, if I were you I would not
give him up to a younger sister...

46:38.379 --> 46:40.465
for all this tumbling downhill.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.717
Marianne's preserver!
Don't run.

46:42.801 --> 46:45.094
The man himself.

46:45.178 --> 46:50.600
Come, Brandon. We know when we are not
wanted. Let us leave him to the ladies.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.977
Thank you so much for calling.

46:55.271 --> 46:58.691
Marianne, the colonel
and Sir John are leaving.

46:58.775 --> 47:01.903
Good-bye, Sir John. Colonel,
thank you for the flowers.

47:13.289 --> 47:17.210
How do you do, Colonel? How does he do?
How do <i>you</i> do, more like.

47:17.293 --> 47:20.213
Go on in.
They're waiting for you.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.215
Come on, Briar!

47:22.298 --> 47:24.217
Come on.

47:28.429 --> 47:31.140
Good day,
Mr. Willoughby.

47:31.224 --> 47:33.142
Stop it.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.603
Stop it.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.606
Mr. Willoughby.

47:38.690 --> 47:41.985
What a pleasure
to see you again.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.748
The pleasure is all mine,
I can assure you.

47:43.820 --> 47:45.530
I trust Miss Marianne
has not caught cold?

47:45.613 --> 47:48.533
You found out my name.
But of course.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.536
- The neighborhood
is crawling with my spies.

47:51.619 --> 47:54.497
And since you cannot
venture out to nature,

47:54.581 --> 47:57.000
nature must be brought to you.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.879
How beautiful.
These are not from the hothouse.

48:02.130 --> 48:05.049
I see mine is not
the first offering,

48:05.133 --> 48:07.051
nor the most elegant.

48:07.135 --> 48:09.679
I obtained those
from an obliging field.

48:09.762 --> 48:11.681
I've always preferred wildflowers.

48:11.764 --> 48:13.892
I suspected as much.

48:13.975 --> 48:16.436
Elinor, would you put these in
water, please? Yes. Excuse me.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.439
Our gratitude is beyond expression.
But it is I who am grateful.

48:19.522 --> 48:23.526
I've often passed this cottage and
grieved for its lonely state.

48:23.610 --> 48:27.071
Then the first news I had from Lady Allen
when I arrived was that it was taken.

48:27.155 --> 48:30.575
I felt a peculiar interest in the event
which nothing can account for...

48:30.658 --> 48:33.494
but my present delight
in meeting you.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.538
Pray, sit down, Mr. Willoughby.
Thank you.

48:35.622 --> 48:38.249
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

48:38.333 --> 48:39.834
I am.
We all are.

48:42.003 --> 48:46.090
Marianne is reading them out to us.
Which are your favorites?

48:46.174 --> 48:49.636
Without a doubt, mine is 116.

48:49.719 --> 48:53.765
Let me not to the marriage of
true minds admit impediments.

48:53.848 --> 48:57.310
Love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds...

48:57.393 --> 49:00.229
or bends with the remover to remove.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.358
Then how does it continue?

49:03.441 --> 49:07.028
No! It is an ever-fixed mark-
It is an ever-fixed mark-

49:07.111 --> 49:09.447
- that looks on storms-
- that looks on tempests-

49:09.530 --> 49:12.617
- I-Is it "tempests"?
- I do believe it is "tempests."

49:12.700 --> 49:14.786
Let me find it.

49:14.869 --> 49:18.456
It's strange you should be reading these,
for look, I carry them with me always.

49:18.539 --> 49:21.167
How beautiful.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.053
Until tomorrow then.

49:36.349 --> 49:38.935
And my pocket sonnets
are yours, Miss Marianne,

49:39.018 --> 49:41.646
a talisman
against further injury.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.732
Good-bye.
Thank you.

49:49.988 --> 49:52.907
Good work, Marianne.

49:52.991 --> 49:55.910
You've covered Shakespeare,
Scott, all forms of poetry.

49:55.994 --> 49:59.414
Another meeting will ascertain his views
on nature and romantic attachments.

49:59.497 --> 50:03.418
Then you will have nothing left to talk
about and the relationship will be over.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.461
I suppose I have erred
against decorum.

50:05.545 --> 50:09.924
I should've been dull and spiritless and talked
only of the weather or the state of the roads.

50:10.008 --> 50:13.928
No, but Mr. Willoughby can be in no
doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

50:14.012 --> 50:17.432
Why should he doubt it? Why
should I hide my regard?

50:17.515 --> 50:20.935
No particular reason. Only
that we know so little of him.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.438
Time alone does not
determine intimacy.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.941
Seven years would be insufficient to make
some people acquainted with each other,

50:27.025 --> 50:30.945
and seven days can be more than enough for
others. Or seven hours, in this case.

50:31.029 --> 50:33.448
I feel I know
Mr. Willoughby already.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.450
If I had more shallow feelings,

50:35.533 --> 50:38.953
I could, perhaps, conceal them as you do.
Marianne, that is not fair.

50:39.037 --> 50:42.457
I'm sorry, Elinor. I did not mean-
Do not trouble yourself, Marianne.

50:47.045 --> 50:49.547
I do not understand her, Mama.

51:18.701 --> 51:21.496
Marianne.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.166
Haven't you finished yet?

51:25.249 --> 51:28.377
No. Patience.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.643
Surely you're not going to
deny us beef as well as sugar.

51:43.726 --> 51:47.647
There is nothing under 10 pence a
pound, Mama. We have to economize.

51:47.730 --> 51:50.650
Do you want us to starve? No.

51:50.733 --> 51:52.652
Just not to eat beef.

52:05.039 --> 52:08.000
This one here?

52:19.804 --> 52:22.723
Willoughby,
slow down for the corner!

52:22.807 --> 52:25.726
Careful!
You'll run someone down!

52:30.857 --> 52:32.775
Did you see that?

52:32.859 --> 52:35.778
I do think they'll be
married before long.

52:35.862 --> 52:40.116
If there was any true impropriety in my
behavior, I should be sensible of it, Elinor.

52:40.199 --> 52:44.120
But it has already exposed you to
some very impertinent remarks.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.414
Do you not begin to doubt
your own discretion?

52:47.540 --> 52:50.960
If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs.
Jennings are proof of impropriety,

52:51.043 --> 52:53.337
then we are all offending
every moment of our lives.

52:53.421 --> 52:55.756
Good morning!
Good morning, Colonel!

52:58.593 --> 53:01.971
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.

53:02.054 --> 53:05.016
I come to issue an invitation.

53:07.977 --> 53:11.397
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford,

53:11.480 --> 53:15.818
if you would care to join us,
on Thursday next.

53:15.902 --> 53:18.988
Mrs. Jennings' daughter
and her husband...

53:19.071 --> 53:21.157
are traveling up especially.

53:23.367 --> 53:26.329
We should be delighted, Colonel.

53:26.412 --> 53:31.542
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.713
I should be delighted
to join you, Colonel.

53:41.093 --> 53:43.012
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.

53:43.095 --> 53:45.514
Good morning, Colonel. Good morning, Mr.
Willoughby.

53:45.598 --> 53:49.018
The colonel has invited us to
Delaford, Willoughby. Excellent.

53:49.101 --> 53:52.104
I understand you have a particularly
fine pianoforte, Colonel.

53:52.188 --> 53:54.732
- A Broadwood Grand.
- A Broadwood Grand?

53:54.815 --> 53:58.319
Then I shall really be able to play for
you all. We shall look forward to it.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.613
Good day.
Walk on. Walk on.

54:01.656 --> 54:03.616
Good-bye.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.378
Your sister seems very happy.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.380
Yes.

54:17.463 --> 54:20.383
Marianne does not approve
of hiding her emotions.

54:21.676 --> 54:23.594
In fact,
her romantic prejudices...

54:23.678 --> 54:26.764
have the unfortunate tendency
to set propriety at naught.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.558
She is wholly unspoilt.

54:29.642 --> 54:32.228
Rather too unspoilt in my view.

54:32.311 --> 54:36.232
The sooner she becomes acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

54:41.195 --> 54:44.115
I knew a lady very like your sister-

54:44.198 --> 54:47.118
the same impulsive sweetness of temper-

54:47.201 --> 54:51.497
who was forced into, as you put it, a
better acquaintance with the world.

54:52.665 --> 54:56.085
The result was only
ruination and despair.

54:58.671 --> 55:01.090
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

55:04.969 --> 55:08.139
Colonel Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

55:08.222 --> 55:11.434
We must have your sky kite.
Mind them pretty ribbons.

55:11.517 --> 55:12.977
John, set that in there!

55:15.479 --> 55:17.398
Imagine my surprise,
Mrs. Dashwood,

55:17.481 --> 55:20.651
when Charlotte and her lord and
master appeared with our cousin Lucy.

55:20.735 --> 55:23.696
The last person
I expected to see!

55:23.779 --> 55:25.906
She probably came
to join in the fun,

55:25.990 --> 55:29.410
for there are no funds for such
luxuries at home, poor thing.

55:29.493 --> 55:32.913
I'd not seen you for so long, dear Mrs.
Jennings, I couldn't resist the opportunity.

55:32.997 --> 55:37.168
You sly thing! It was the Misses Dashwood
she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mama.

55:37.251 --> 55:40.212
I have heard nothing but "Miss
Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that"...

55:40.296 --> 55:42.006
for I don't know how long.

55:42.089 --> 55:44.675
And what do you think of them
now you do see them, Lucy?

55:44.759 --> 55:48.596
My mother has talked of nothing else in
her letters since you came to Barton.

55:48.679 --> 55:52.016
Mr. Palmer, are they not the very
creatures she describes? Nothing like.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.019
Mr. Palmer,
you are quite rude today.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.355
He's to be an MP,
Mrs. Dashwood.

55:57.438 --> 56:00.775
It is very fatiguing for him for he
is forced to make everybody like him.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.861
He says it is quite shocking. I
never said anything so irrational.

56:03.944 --> 56:06.655
Mr. Palmer's
so droll.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.657
He's always out of humor.

56:08.741 --> 56:10.451
Here he comes.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.454
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.710
Whoa. Whoa.

56:19.794 --> 56:22.338
Hello,
Mr. Willoughby!

56:22.421 --> 56:26.050
Come, you must meet my daughter Charlotte.
Mr. Palmer.

56:26.133 --> 56:30.471
- How do you do?
- And our little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.973
Welcome to our party,
Miss Steele.

56:33.057 --> 56:35.226
Turn about. Come 'round, boys.
Come 'round.

56:35.309 --> 56:39.438
I know Mr. Willoughby
extremely well.

56:39.522 --> 56:42.858
May I beg a seat beside you,
Miss Dashwood?

56:42.942 --> 56:45.069
I've so longed to make
your better acquaintance.

56:45.152 --> 56:49.657
- I've heard nothing but the highest praise of you.
- I would be delighted.

56:49.740 --> 56:53.160
But Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

56:53.244 --> 56:55.079
No.
I am sure to disappoint.

56:55.162 --> 56:58.082
No, for it was from quite
another source I heard you praised,

56:58.165 --> 57:00.876
and one not at all inclined
to exaggeration.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.003
What can this be?

57:14.098 --> 57:16.267
Is Colonel Brandon here?
Over here!

57:16.350 --> 57:18.018
Where is he?
There he is!

57:26.026 --> 57:28.529
My horse. Quickly!

57:28.612 --> 57:31.615
- What's the matter, Brandon?
- I must away to London.

57:31.699 --> 57:34.535
- No! Impossible!
- Imperative!

57:34.618 --> 57:37.413
But w-we're all assembled!
I'll send for my things later.

57:37.496 --> 57:40.416
We cannot picnic at Delaford without
our host. Go up to town tomorrow.

57:40.499 --> 57:43.461
Or wait until we return and start then.
You'd not be six hours later.

57:43.544 --> 57:46.589
I cannot afford
to lose one minute.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.591
Forgive me.

57:48.674 --> 57:52.261
I hope it's nothing
serious, Colonel.

57:52.344 --> 57:56.307
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual!

57:58.851 --> 58:01.854
Frailty, thy name is Brandon.

58:02.480 --> 58:05.149
There are some people
who can't bear a party of pleasure.

58:05.232 --> 58:09.737
You're a very wicked pair. Colonel
Brandon will be sadly missed.

58:09.820 --> 58:14.450
Why? When he is the sort of man
that everyone speaks well of...

58:14.533 --> 58:16.952
- and no one remembers to talk to.
- Exactly.

58:17.036 --> 58:20.372
Nonsense.
Colonel Brandon is very highly respected at Barton Park.

58:20.456 --> 58:22.666
Hmph. Which is enough
censure in itself?

58:22.750 --> 58:24.877
Really, Willoughby.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.880
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.883
I know you
and your wicked ways.!

58:30.966 --> 58:33.886
Come, Miss Dashwood. Reveal your beau.
Reveal him, I say.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.889
Let's have no secrets between friends.
Let me winkle them out of you.

58:36.972 --> 58:40.184
Hush. I do declare,
Miss Marianne.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.853
If I do not have you married
to the colonel by teatime,

58:42.937 --> 58:45.356
I shall swallow my own bonnet.

58:45.439 --> 58:47.358
As if you could marry
such a character.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.319
Why should you dislike him?

58:51.820 --> 58:55.032
Because he has threatened me
with rain when I wanted it fine.

58:56.951 --> 58:59.662
He has found fault
with the balance of my high flyer.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.873
And I cannot persuade him
to buy my brown mare.

59:02.957 --> 59:05.376
If it will be of any satisfaction
to you, however,

59:05.459 --> 59:08.104
to be told that I believe his character
to be, in all other respects...

59:08.128 --> 59:11.549
irreproachable,
then I'm ready to confess it.

59:11.632 --> 59:14.677
And in return for such an acknowledgment
that must give me some pain-

59:14.760 --> 59:17.555
Aaah! You cannot deny
me the privilege...

59:17.638 --> 59:20.558
of disliking him
as much as I adore...

59:25.729 --> 59:27.648
this cottage.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.695
I have great plans for improvements
to it, you know, Mr. Willoughby.

59:32.778 --> 59:36.407
Now, that I will
never consent to.

59:36.490 --> 59:38.951
Not a stone must be
added to its walls.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.581
Were I rich enough, I would
instantly pull down Combe Magna...

59:43.664 --> 59:46.125
and rebuild it
in the exact image of this cottage.

59:46.208 --> 59:50.379
With dark narrow stairs, a poky hall
and a fire that smokes, I suppose.

59:50.462 --> 59:53.007
Especially the fire that smokes.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.510
For then I should be as happy at
Combe as I have been at Barton.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.974
But this place has one claim on my affections
that none other can possibly share.

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:07.646
Promise me you'll
never change it.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:15.112
I'm honored that so fair
and virtuous a lady...

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:19.283
should compromise her honor by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.119
That is exactly what
Elinor would say.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:25.164
And she would be right.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:29.126
Miss Marianne, will you do me the honor
of granting me an interview tomorrow...

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.669
alone?

01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:33.297
Willoughby, we're always alone.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.633
But there is-

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.469
There's something very particular
I should like to ask you.

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:43.057
Of course.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.352
I shall ask Mama
if I may stay behind from church.

01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:49.563
Thank you.

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:53.192
Until tomorrow, then.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.905
Miss Marianne.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.584
Virtue.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:14.546
Silently and with fear,
enter thou into the hearts...

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.757
of all them
that hear me this day.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.259
Do you think he'll kneel
down when he asks her? Shh!

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:22.930
The fear of him is the beginning of wisdom.
They always kneel down.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.100
Good understanding have
all they that do thereafter.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.186
Margaret, Margaret, come back.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.438
Splendid sermon!
Splendid.

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:33.941
No!

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.281
What is wrong, dearest?

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:44.785
Willoughby, what is the matter?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.329
I must-

01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:51.375
Forgive me, Mrs. Dashwood.
I'm sent-

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:55.879
That is to say, Lady Allen has
exercised the privilege of riches...

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:59.049
upon a dependent cousin
and is sending me to London.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:02.886
- When? This morning?
- Almost this moment.

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:04.888
What a disappointment.

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.891
But your business will not detain
you from us for long, I hope?

01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:10.894
You're very kind, but...

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:15.107
I have no idea of returning
immediately into Devonshire.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.901
I'm seldom invited to Allenham
more than once a year.

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:21.363
For shame, Willoughby. Can you wait for
an invitation from Barton Cottage?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.201
My engagements at present
are of such a n-nature-

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:31.123
That is to say,
I dare not flatter my-

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.542
It is folly to linger
in this manner.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.044
I will not torment myself further.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:39.757
Willoughby, come back!

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.344
Margaret, ask Betsy to make a
cup of hot tea for Marianne.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:47.556
What is wrong, my love?
Do not ask me questions.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.143
Betsy!
Please let me be!

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.859
They must have quarreled.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.069
That is unlikely.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.364
Perhaps this Lady Allen...

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:07.367
disapproves of his regard
for Marianne...

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.620
and has invented an excuse
to send him away.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.706
Then why did he not say as much?

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.626
It is not like Willoughby
to be secretive.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.420
What is it you suspect him of?
I can hardly tell you.

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:22.216
But why was his manner so guilty?
What are you saying, Elinor?

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:25.135
That he's been acting a part to
your sister for all this time?

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:27.221
No. He loves her.
I'm sure.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.140
Of course he loves her.

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:33.894
- Has he left her with any assurance of his return?
- Marianne!

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:38.315
Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?
Certainly not.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:42.277
I cannot force a confidence from
Marianne and nor should you.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:45.781
We must trust her to confide
in us in her own time.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:51.370
There was something so underhand
in the manner of his leaving.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:54.540
You are resolved, then, to think the
worst of him? I'm not resolved.

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.167
I prefer to give him the benefit
of my good opinion.

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.461
He deserves no less
from all of us!

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:03.423
Mama, I am very fond
of Willoughby.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.885
Mama. Mama.

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:14.101
She would not let me in.

01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:54.474
To sail us up the river.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:57.227
How will we travel on land?

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:04.526
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only <i>you</i> would stop.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:08.822
'Twas you who took her
off my hands, Mr. Palmer.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.867
And a very good bargain
you made of it too.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:15.579
And now I have the whip hand over
you, for you cannot give her back.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.377
Miss Marianne, come
and play a round with us.

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:25.380
Looking out at the weather
will not bring him back.

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:29.259
She ate nothing at dinner. Mind, we're
all a little forlorn these days.

01:05:29.343 --> 01:05:31.970
London has swallowed
all our company.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:37.434
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might have our... discussion.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.436
Our discussion?

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.648
There is a particular question
I've long wanted to ask you.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.859
But perhaps you'll think me impertinent?
I cannot imagine so.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.861
But it is an odd question.
Forgive me.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.364
I have no wish to trouble you.
No, my dear Miss Steele.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.087
Miss Dashwood, if only Mr. Willoughby
had gone home to Combe Magna,

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:56.370
we could have taken Miss Marianne to
see him. We live but half a mile away.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.996
Five and a half.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.084
No. I cannot believe it is that far, for you
can see the place from the top of our hill.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.128
Is it really five and a half?
No. I cannot believe it.

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:07.839
Try.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:12.552
You have my permission to ask any manner
of question, if that is of any help.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.055
Thank you.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:19.017
I wonder, are you at all acquainted
with your sister-in-law's mother?

01:06:19.101 --> 01:06:21.478
Mrs. Ferrars?

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.064
With Fanny's mother?

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.484
No, I-
I have never met her.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.654
You must think me strange
for inquiring.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:34.157
If only I dared tell it.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:37.995
Lucy, if she tells you
aught of the famous Mr. F,

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.372
you must pass it on.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.751
Will you take a turn
with me, Miss Dashwood?

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:46.753
Of course.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:52.509
I, I had no idea...

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:56.430
that you were at all
connected with that family.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:07:00.017
I am certainly nothing
to Mrs. Ferrars at present,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.769
but the time may come...

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:06.940
when we may be very
intimately connected.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.735
What do you mean?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.698
Do you have an underst-

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.451
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.536
The youngest?

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.289
No. I never met him in my life.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.292
No. With Edward.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.504
Edward? Edward Ferrars?

01:07:29.588 --> 01:07:33.258
Edward and I have
been secretly engaged...

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.844
these five years.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.225
You may well be surprised.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:47.230
I should never have mentioned it had I not known
I could entirely trust you to keep our secret.

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:52.486
Edward would not mind my telling you for I
know he looks on you quite as his own sister.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.825
I'm sorry.
We- Surely, we-

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:04.748
We-We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.750
The very same.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:11.421
He was four years under the tutelage of
my uncle, Mr. Pratt, down in Plymouth.

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:13.799
Has he never spoken of it?

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:17.594
Yes.
Yes, I believe he has.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.184
I was very unwilling to enter into it
without his mother's approval.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:27.187
But we loved each other
with too great a passion for prudence.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:31.441
Though you do not know him
as well as I, Miss Dashwood,

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:36.822
you must have seen how capable he is of
making a woman sincerely attached to him.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:43.036
I cannot pretend it has not
been very hard on us both.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.581
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

01:08:57.551 --> 01:09:00.136
You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood.
Are you quite well?

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.140
Perfectly well. Thank you.
I've not offended you?

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:06.143
- On the contrary.
- I cannot stand it any longer.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.103
I must know what
you're saying, Lucy.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:12.607
If anyone finds out, it will ruin him.
Promise me you'll not tell a soul.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:14.734
Miss Dashwood
is quite engrossed.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:18.238
- You're allowed no secrets from us, Miss Lucy.
- I give you my word.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:23.577
Well, and what can have fascinated you
to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.037
- Tell us all!
- We were talking of London, ma'am.

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:29.749
And of all its diversions.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.377
Do you hear that, Charlotte?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.755
While you were so busy whispering,
Charlotte and I have concocted a plan.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.841
It is the best plan in the world!

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:42.511
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy...

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.682
and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.185
Splendid idea!
London?

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.145
Isn't is splendid?

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.729
Can I go?
Can I go?

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:54.064
You know perfectly well
you're too young, dearest.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:58.028
I shall convey you all to my house in Chelsea,
and we will taste the delights of the season.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.529
What say you?

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:02.365
Please, can I go?
I'm 12 soon.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:06.578
Mr. Palmer, do you not long to have
the Misses Dashwood come to London?

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.664
I came into Devonshire
with no other view.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:13.043
Mrs. Jennings,
you are very kind,

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.711
but we cannot possibly
leave our mother.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.380
Your mother can
spare you very well!

01:10:17.464 --> 01:10:20.217
Of course I can!
Of course she can!

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.720
I could not be more delighted.
It is exactly what I would wish.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:26.723
I will brook no refusal,
Miss Dashwood.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.226
Let us strike hands
on the bargain.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:33.563
And if I do not have the three
of you married by Michaelmas,

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:36.024
it will not be my fault.

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.944
Mrs. Jennings!

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:46.284
I was never so grateful
in all my life...

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:48.662
as I am to Mrs. Jennings.
Elinor.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:52.165
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.542
Are you asleep?

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:59.256
With you in the room?

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:03.927
I do not believe you feel as calm
as you look, Elinor. Not even you.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.972
I will never sleep tonight.

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:11.393
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.895
Nothing of significance.

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:21.945
You must look after Mama!

01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:27.284
We will! We will!

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:30.036
Bye-bye!
Good-bye!

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.874
How do you think I live
poking about...

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.753
in that great house all by myself when I
have been used to having Charlotte...

01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:43.133
until she had the baby? I have
written to Edward, Miss Dashwood.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.969
And yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:49.014
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

01:11:49.097 --> 01:11:51.641
I should imagine not.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:53.643
It's so hard.

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:56.688
I believe my only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:59.566
You're fortunate, over
such a lengthy engagement,

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.235
never to have had any
doubts on that score.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:05.113
I'm of rather a jealous nature.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:09.159
And if he talked more of one
young woman than any other-

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:12.704
But he's never given a
moment's alarm on that count.

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:17.917
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:27.510
There you are, Pigeon. Have you missed me?
Very much, ma'am.

01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:29.679
You always say so,
and I never believe you.

01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:31.848
I trust everything's in order.
In good order, ma'am.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:35.435
Though if I might suggest the ordering
of coal- Don't talk to me of coals.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.271
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see?

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:40.273
Tea, Pigeon, tea.
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.192
Then, my dears.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.694
Well, you do not waste
any time, Miss Marianne.

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:47.364
Give it to Pigeon there.
He'll see to it.

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:51.284
Come along, dear. A letter. So
they're definitely engaged.

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:54.180
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes here in town.

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.956
Dear Miss Steele,
I know of no such plan.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:03.088
John and Fanny are in town. I think
we shall be forced to see them.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.302
I see.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:16.351
I think it was for next door.
Yes, you're right.

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.896
Marianne, do sit down
for two seconds together.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.148
You're making me nervous.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.448
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

01:13:30.532 --> 01:13:32.951
Is Miss Marianne here?

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:36.413
- Shh.
- Who shall I say is calling?

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:38.623
Very good, sir.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.167
Elinor, it is Willoughby.

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.337
Indeed, it is.

01:13:51.803 --> 01:13:53.721
Excuse me, Colonel.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.516
Um, Colonel.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.106
What a pleasure to see you. Have
you been in London all this while?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.609
Forgive me, Miss Dashwood.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:12.031
I have heard reports
through town that-

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:18.997
Miss Dashwood,
tell me once and for all.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.835
Is everything finally resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.632
Colonel, though neither one
has informed me...

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:32.510
of their understanding,

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:36.264
I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.727
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.524
To your sister,
I wish all imaginable happiness.

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:52.155
To Mr. Willoughby,
that he may endeavor...

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.073
to deserve her.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.160
What do you mean?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.915
Forgive me, I-

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:08.087
Forgive me.

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:24.312
Where is dear Edward, John?
We expect to see him daily.

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:27.398
Who is "dear Edward," may I ask?
Who, indeed?

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:30.693
My brother, Mrs. Jennings.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.695
Indeed!

01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:35.198
Is that Ferrars with an "F"?

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.831
Are there any messages, Pigeon?
No.

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:47.252
No messages at all? No cards?
None, madam.

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:50.421
I notice you do not inquire
for your messages, Miss Dashwood.

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:52.840
No, indeed, for I do not
expect any, Mrs. Jennings.

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:55.343
I have no-very little
acquaintance in town.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.030
I don't want to hear another
word about the ham bone, Pigeon.

01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:18.950
You and Cartwright must
sort that out between you.

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:21.494
No messages, ma'am.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:24.831
Now, do not fret, my dear.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.916
I have been told that
this good weather...

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.086
is keeping many of our sportsmen
in the country at present.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:34.424
But the frost will soon drive them to town.
Depend on it.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:37.302
Of course. I had not
thought of that.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.637
Thank you,
Mrs. Jennings.

01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:42.432
And Miss Dashwood may
set her heart at rest,

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:46.227
for I overheard your sister-in-law say
she is to invite the elusive Mr. F...

01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:48.229
to the ball tonight.

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:51.024
Do be careful, dears.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.192
The horses have been here.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:56.529
Careful. It's beginning
to rain also.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:58.531
Now follow me.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:04.871
Whoops.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.049
Steady!

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.468
No, no, no, no, no.
This is madness.

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:20.720
This is dribbling,
babbling madness!

01:17:27.769 --> 01:17:29.395
Mama!

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:32.565
This is very merry!
Charlotte!

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:36.319
Do you spy anyone we know?
Not a soul.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:38.571
Ask Mr. Palmer to look.
He has a better view.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:42.158
Mr. Palmer, do you see
anyone of our acquaintance?

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.828
Unfortunately not. How can you
be such a tease, Mr. Palmer?

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:49.499
There is Mrs. John Dashwood. I can
see her for myself. Mrs. Dashwood!

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.542
Hello!

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:55.254
Come along, my dears.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.803
There you are!

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:04.597
Mrs. Jennings. Goodness.
How hot it is.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:06.849
Indeed. You're not
alone, I trust?

01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:09.644
Indeed, no. John is just
gone to fetch my brother.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:11.646
They've been eating ices.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:16.943
Your brother! I declare.
This is good news, indeed.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:21.197
At long last! Miss Dashwood, I
declare I shall faint clean away.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.366
Mrs. Jennings,
I am pleased to see you.

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.452
May I present
my brother-in-law,

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:28.871
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.001
Um, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Steele, Miss Marianne.

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:39.257
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:45.054
So you must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:47.223
Miss Dashwood here
was counting on him.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:50.226
He's far too busy
for such gatherings...

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:54.188
and has no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

01:18:54.272 --> 01:18:59.360
I declare. I do not know what
the young men are about these days.

01:18:59.444 --> 01:19:02.739
Are they all in hiding?
Come, Mr. Robert.

01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:07.285
In the absence of your brother, you must
dance with our lovely Miss Dashwood here.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.460
It would be my honor.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:22.592
And perhaps Miss Steele...

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.887
might consider reserving
the allemande.

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:10.097
You reside in Devonshire,
I believe, Miss Dashwood?

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:12.099
Yes.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.812
In a cottage?

01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.439
Yes.

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:22.944
I am excessively fond
of a cottage.

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:28.950
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.673
Mr. Willoughby.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.925
How do you do, Miss Dashwood?

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.553
I'm very well.
Thank you.

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:52.139
How's your family?
They're all extremely well,

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:54.767
Mr. Willoughby.

01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:57.520
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:02.775
Willoughby!

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:05.862
Who is she?

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:08.698
She came in with Mrs. Jennings.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.575
Mrs. John Dashwood.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.121
Good God, Willoughby.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:21.043
Will you not
shake hands with me?

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.547
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:30.052
Willoughby, what is the matter?

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:33.055
Why have you not come to see me?

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:37.977
Were you not in London? Have
you not received my letters?

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:42.982
Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the
information you were so good as to send me.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:47.695
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.697
tell me what is wrong.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:54.327
Thank you.
I'm most obliged.

01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:58.414
If you will excuse me,
I must rejoin my party.

01:22:11.177 --> 01:22:13.137
Willoughby.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:24.106
Go to him, Elinor. Force him
to come to me instantly.

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:26.943
Marianne, you must-
you must come away.

01:22:30.196 --> 01:22:33.032
Do you know them?

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.118
Acquaintances from the country.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.705
Indeed.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:42.625
Wearing their
country fashions, I see.

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:47.463
Come away, dearest.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.548
Come away.

01:22:56.097 --> 01:22:59.350
I do not understand. I must speak to him.
I must go to him.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.310
There you are, my dear!

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:03.896
My goodness.
Come, dear.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.898
You need some air.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.072
She called out his name.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:15.074
John Dashwood's sisters.

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:22.081
Lucy! Lucy, come, dear.
We must go.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.667
We're leaving so soon? If I might
be so bold, Mrs. Jennings,

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.169
it would be our pleasure to
escort your young charge home.

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:30.297
How very kind. That is
very handsome of you.

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:34.844
She actually sent him messages
during the night? Yes, indeed.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:38.055
Mr. Pigeon was
not himself all day.

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:49.191
Marianne, please tell me.

01:23:49.275 --> 01:23:51.777
Do not ask me questions.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:54.405
You have no confidence in me.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:58.576
This reproach from you?
You who confide in no one?

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.371
I have nothing to tell.

01:24:02.455 --> 01:24:05.833
Nor I. Neither of us
have anything to tell.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:09.920
I, because I conceal nothing and you,
because you communicate nothing.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.890
I wish Lady Charteris would
limit her invitation list.

01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:23.559
I do not know when
I've been so warm.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:26.687
I'm glad we left early.

01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:29.190
There, now.

01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:38.199
Lovers' quarrels
are swift to heal.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:42.661
That letter will do the trick. Mark
my words. Well, I must be off.

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:47.708
I do hope he doesn't keep her
waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood.

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:50.753
It hurts to see her
looking so forlorn.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:53.089
Pigeon. Pigeon!

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:56.884
What a welcome I had from
Edward's family, Miss Dashwood.

01:24:56.967 --> 01:25:00.888
I'm surprised you never mentioned how
agreeable your sister-in-law is.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:03.557
And Mr. Robert-
all so affable.

01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:06.936
It is perhaps fortunate that none
of them knows of your engagement.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.979
Excuse me.

01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:20.074
"My dear madam,

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:24.995
I'm quite at a loss to discover in what point
I could be so unfortunate as to offend you.

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:27.248
My esteem for your family
is very sincere,

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:31.085
but if I have given rise to a belief of
more than I felt or meant to express,

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:35.089
I shall reproach myself for
not having been more guarded.

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:38.008
My affections have long
been engaged elsewhere,

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:41.470
and it is with great regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair...

01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:44.140
which you so obligingly
bestowed upon me.

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:46.809
I am, et cetera,
John Willoughby."

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.811
Marianne.

01:25:51.272 --> 01:25:53.232
Dearest.

01:25:55.943 --> 01:25:58.571
It is best to know what
his intentions are at once.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.217
Think of what you would have felt if your
engagement had carried on for months and months...

01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.201
before he chose
to put an end to it.

01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:06.745
We're not engaged.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.581
But y-you wrote to him.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:11.876
I thought that he must have left you
with some kind of understanding.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:15.546
No. He's not so unworthy
as you think him.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:19.216
Not so unworthy? Did he
tell you that he loved you?

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.886
Yes.

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:25.055
No. Never absolutely.

01:26:25.139 --> 01:26:28.058
It was every day implied,
but never declared.

01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:31.687
Sometimes I thought it had
been, but it never was.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:35.524
He has broken no vow. He has!
He's broken faith with all of us.

01:26:35.608 --> 01:26:38.194
He made us all believe
he loved you.

01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:40.196
He did.

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:43.407
He did. He loved me
as I loved him.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:50.664
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:54.543
Poor thing.
She looks very bad.

01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:57.213
'Tis no wonder, Miss Dashwood,
for 'tis but too true.

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:00.674
I was told in the street here by
Miss Morton, a very great friend,

01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:09.892
Well, said I, if 'tis true,
then he is a good-for-nothing...

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.436
who's used my young friend
abominably ill.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:15.397
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague his heart out.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:19.818
My dear.

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.905
He's not the only
young man worth having.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:26.825
With your pretty face, you'll
never want for admirers.

01:27:27.493 --> 01:27:30.204
There.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:33.540
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:38.337
I will go look out
something to tempt her.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.049
Does she care for olives?

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.803
I cannot tell you.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:56.188
Apparently,
they never were engaged.

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:03.779
She cannot have expected
him to go through with it.

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.948
But I feel for Marianne.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.576
She will lose her bloom and
end a spinster, like Elinor.

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:15.165
I think, my dear, we might consider having
them to stay with us for a few days.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:19.086
We are, after all, family.
And my father- My love.

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:23.132
I would ask them
with all my heart, but...

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:26.218
I've already asked
Miss Steele for a visit.

01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:30.514
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company at once.

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:33.892
We can invite your sisters
some other year, you know.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:37.813
And Miss Steele will profit far
more from your generosity.

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:41.066
Poor girl.
Excellent notion.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:49.074
Colonel Brandon to see you,
Miss Dashwood.

01:28:49.158 --> 01:28:51.076
Colonel.

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:54.830
Thank you so much for coming.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:57.166
How is your sister?

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:59.585
I must get her home
as quickly as possible.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:02.671
The Palmers can take us as far
as their home at Cleveland,

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.381
which is but a day from Barton.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:09.136
Then permit me to accompany you and take you
straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself.

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.805
I confess that is precisely
what I had hoped for.

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:14.808
Marianne suffers cruelly.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:20.856
What pains me most is how hard she
tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.734
But you know her disposition.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:30.866
Perhaps... I-

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.702
Miss Dashwood,
would you allow me...

01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:38.207
to relate some circumstances which nothing
but an earnest desire of being useful-

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.377
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:55.891
When I quitted Barton last-

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.602
No, I must go further back.

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:03.065
No doubt-

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:06.402
No doubt, Mrs. Jennings
has apprised you...

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:09.738
of certain events in my past.

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:13.659
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.457
What is not commonly known
is that...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.919
20 years ago, before she died,

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:27.131
Eliza bore
an illegitimate child.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.385
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

01:30:32.678 --> 01:30:35.431
As Eliza lay dying,

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:38.767
she begged me
to look after the child.

01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:40.936
I had failed Eliza
in every other way.

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:44.273
I could not refuse her now.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:47.943
I took the child-
Beth is her name-

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:52.865
and placed her with a family in the country where I
could be sure that she would be well looked after.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.616
I saw her whenever I could.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:58.871
And she grew up so headstrong.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:01.748
And God forgive me,
I indulged her.

01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:05.502
I allowed her too much freedom.

01:31:05.586 --> 01:31:07.963
Almost a year ago,
she disappeared.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.632
Disappeared?
I instigated a search,

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:13.760
but for eight months I was
left to imagine the worst.

01:31:13.844 --> 01:31:16.722
At last, on the day
of the Delaford picnic,

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.933
I received the first news
of her.

01:31:21.185 --> 01:31:24.313
She was with child.

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:31.487
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts-

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:33.864
Good God.

01:31:37.576 --> 01:31:39.495
Do you mean Willoughby?

01:31:43.457 --> 01:31:45.334
Before I could
return to confront him,

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.004
Lady Allen had learned of his behavior
and turned him from the house.

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:53.884
He fled to London. Yes, he left us
that morning without any explanation.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.303
Lady Allen
had annulled his legacy.

01:31:56.386 --> 01:31:59.723
He was left with next to nothing and
in danger of losing Combe Magna...

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:02.017
and all the money that
remained to his debtors.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:06.480
So he abandoned Marianne...

01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:16.281
Is Beth still in town?

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:21.203
She has chosen to return to the
country for her confinement.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:31.046
I would not have burdened you,
Miss Dashwood,

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:33.048
had I not, from my heart,

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:35.217
believed it might in time...

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.554
lessen your sister's regrets.

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:50.857
I have described
Mr. Willoughby...

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:54.570
as the worst of libertines.

01:32:54.653 --> 01:32:56.905
But I have since learned
from Lady Allen...

01:32:56.989 --> 01:33:00.242
that he did mean to propose
that day, and therefore,

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:04.580
I cannot deny that his
intentions towards Marianne...

01:33:04.663 --> 01:33:06.999
were honorable.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.001
And...

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:14.715
I feel certain that
he would have married her...

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.717
had it not been-

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.595
For the money.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.936
Dearest, was I right
to tell you?

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.938
Of course.

01:33:32.691 --> 01:33:35.277
Whatever his past actions,

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.529
whatever his present course,

01:33:37.613 --> 01:33:40.782
at least you may be certain
that he loved you.

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:44.411
But not enough.

01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:47.956
Not enough.

01:33:56.715 --> 01:34:00.886
Here is someone to cheer
you up, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:08.477
How is your dear sister,
Miss Dashwood?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.562
Poor thing.

01:34:10.646 --> 01:34:15.400
I must say, I do not know what I should do
if a man treated me with so little respect.

01:34:15.484 --> 01:34:18.445
How are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:21.990
I was never so happy in my
entire life, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:25.327
I do believe your sister-in-law
has taken quite a fancy to me.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:29.414
I had to come and tell you, for you
cannot imagine what has happened.

01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:34.252
No, I cannot. Yesterday, I was
introduced to Edward's mother.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:38.006
And she was a vast deal
more than civil.

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.008
I have not yet seen Edward,

01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.052
but I feel sure to very soon.

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:44.054
Come in.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:50.769
There's a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:58.610
Do ask him to come in.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.450
This way, sir.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:25.345
Mr. Ferrars.

01:35:25.429 --> 01:35:27.597
Miss Dashwood.

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:35.814
What a pleasure to see you.

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.692
- Miss Dashwood, how can I- - You
know Miss Steele, of course.

01:35:44.531 --> 01:35:47.909
Indeed. How do you do,
Miss Steele?

01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:50.787
I am well, thank you,
Mr. Ferrars.

01:35:51.997 --> 01:35:54.458
Do sit down.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:36:00.088
- Thank you.
- Yes.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:05.051
You must be surprised
to find me here, Mr. Ferrars.

01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:07.888
I expect you thought I was
at your sister's house.

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.266
Let me fetch Marianne.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:14.811
- Mr. Ferrars, she would be most disappointed to miss you.
- Edward?

01:36:15.896 --> 01:36:18.648
Edward, I heard your voice.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.152
At last, you've found us.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:25.822
Forgive me, Marianne. My
visit is shamefully overdue.

01:36:25.906 --> 01:36:29.409
You're pale. You've not
been unwell, I hope.

01:36:29.493 --> 01:36:32.954
Do not think of me.
Elinor is well, you see.

01:36:33.038 --> 01:36:35.624
That must be enough
for both of us.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:39.211
I-Indeed. And h-how do you
enjoy London, Miss Marianne?

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:43.131
Not at all. The sight of you is
all the pleasure it has afforded.

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:45.592
Is that not so, Elinor?

01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:49.930
Why have you not
come to see us before?

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:52.974
I have been
much engaged elsewhere.

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:55.519
Engaged elsewhere?

01:36:55.602 --> 01:36:58.021
But what was that when there
were such friends to be met?

01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:01.667
Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men
never honor their engagements, little or great.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:07.239
No, indeed. For Edward is the most incapable
of being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

01:37:11.076 --> 01:37:13.829
Edward, will you not sit?

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:16.581
Elinor, help me to persuade him.

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.385
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I-I must take my leave.

01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:29.970
You're only just arrived.

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:34.432
You would excuse me, but I, um, have an urgent
commission to attend to on Fanny's behalf.

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:38.728
In that case, perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house, Mr. Ferrars.

01:37:41.648 --> 01:37:43.775
It would be an honor.

01:37:46.403 --> 01:37:48.572
Miss Dashwood.

01:37:48.655 --> 01:37:50.615
Marianne.

01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.632
Why did you not
urge him to stay?

01:38:07.716 --> 01:38:10.468
He must have had
his reasons for going.

01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:13.221
His reason was, no doubt,
your coldness.

01:38:13.305 --> 01:38:17.225
If I were Edward, I would assume
you did not care for me at all.

01:38:21.146 --> 01:38:24.399
Poor Miss Marianne looked
very badly the other day.

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:27.861
When I think of her, it frightens me
to think that I shall never marry.

01:38:27.944 --> 01:38:31.615
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than either of the Dashwood girls.

01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:36.244
But I have no dowry.

01:38:36.328 --> 01:38:39.080
There are qualities which
will always make up for that,

01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:42.083
and you have them in abundance.

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:45.378
It would not surprise me if you
were to marry far and away...

01:38:45.462 --> 01:38:47.380
beyond your expectations.

01:38:47.464 --> 01:38:49.883
I wish that might be so.

01:38:52.177 --> 01:38:55.430
There <i>is</i> a young man.

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:58.183
Aha.
I'm glad to hear of it.

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.685
Is he of good fortune
and breeding?

01:39:00.769 --> 01:39:02.687
Of both.

01:39:02.771 --> 01:39:06.524
B-But his family would
certainly oppose the match.

01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:11.279
Tush. They will allow it as
soon as they see you, my dear.

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:14.532
It is a very great secret.

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:18.662
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:22.749
I am the soul of discretion.

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:26.252
If I dared tell-

01:39:27.879 --> 01:39:32.217
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:39.891
It's your brother Edward.

01:39:39.975 --> 01:39:43.144
Viper in my bosom!

01:39:43.228 --> 01:39:46.231
Get out!

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.358
Stop this! Stop this!

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.485
Get out!

01:40:05.417 --> 01:40:08.420
My dears.
What a commotion.

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:12.841
Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very one I
used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood,

01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:17.095
is engaged these five
years to Lucy Steele.

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:19.180
Poor Mr. Ferrars.

01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:21.599
His mother, who by all
accounts is very proud,

01:40:21.683 --> 01:40:25.770
has demanded that he break the
engagement on pain of disinheritance.

01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:29.232
But he has refused
to break his promise to Lucy.

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:33.486
He has stood by her, good man,
and is cut off without a penny.

01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:37.198
She has settled it all
irrevocably on Mr. Robert.

01:40:37.282 --> 01:40:40.660
But I cannot stop.
I must go to Lucy.

01:40:40.744 --> 01:40:44.330
Your sister-in-law scolded her like
any fury, drove her to hysteria.

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.792
How long have you known?

01:40:47.876 --> 01:40:50.795
Pigeon, I need the carriage
this instant!

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.383
Since the night Mrs. Jennings
offered to take us to London.

01:40:55.467 --> 01:40:57.844
Why did you not tell me?

01:40:57.927 --> 01:41:01.222
Lucy told me in the
strictest confidence.

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:03.892
I could not break my word.

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:07.729
- But Edward loves you.
- He made me no promises.

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.815
- He tried to tell me about Lucy.
- He cannot marry her.

01:41:10.899 --> 01:41:14.569
Would you have him treat her even worse
than Willoughby has treated you?

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.613
No.

01:41:16.696 --> 01:41:19.282
But nor would I have him
marry where he does not love.

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:23.411
Edward made his promise a long
time ago, long before he met me.

01:41:23.495 --> 01:41:25.914
Though he may harbor
some r-regret,

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:30.210
I believe that he will be happy in the knowledge
that he did his duty and kept his word.

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:32.212
After all-

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:36.800
After all that is bewitching...

01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:40.261
in the idea of one's happiness
entirely depending on one person,

01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:42.263
it is not always possible.

01:41:42.347 --> 01:41:44.307
We must accept.

01:41:45.517 --> 01:41:48.353
Edward will marry Lucy.

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:51.272
And you and I will go home.

01:41:51.356 --> 01:41:54.400
Always resignation
and acceptance.

01:41:54.484 --> 01:41:57.570
Always prudence
and honor and duty.

01:41:58.863 --> 01:42:01.241
Elinor, where is your heart?

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.911
What do you know of my heart?

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:07.580
What do you know of anything
but your own suffering?

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:10.125
For weeks, Marianne,
I've had this pressing on me...

01:42:10.208 --> 01:42:12.919
without being at liberty to speak
of it to a single creature.

01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:18.591
It was forced on me by the very person
whose prior claims ruined all my hopes.

01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:22.679
I have endured her exultation
again and again...

01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:25.431
whilst knowing myself
to be divided from Edward forever.

01:42:25.515 --> 01:42:27.934
Believe me, Marianne,
had I not been bound to silence,

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:31.229
I could have produced proof enough
of a broken heart even for you.

01:42:35.942 --> 01:42:39.154
Elinor.

01:42:58.298 --> 01:43:01.009
I have heard that owing
to his engagement,

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:05.847
your friend Mr. Ferrars has lost his
fortune irrevocably to his brother.

01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:08.725
Have I been rightly informed?
Is it so?

01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:11.895
It is, indeed, so.

01:43:11.978 --> 01:43:15.064
Are you acquainted
with Mr. Ferrars?

01:43:15.148 --> 01:43:19.694
No, we have never met.

01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:22.864
But I know only too well
the cruelty-

01:43:24.324 --> 01:43:27.660
the impolitic cruelty
of dividing two young people...

01:43:27.744 --> 01:43:30.163
long attached to one another.

01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:37.545
I have a proposal to make that should enable
him to marry Miss Steele immediately.

01:43:39.422 --> 01:43:42.175
Since the gentleman
is so close a friend to your family,

01:43:42.258 --> 01:43:44.427
perhaps you would be good enough
to mention it to him.

01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:53.603
Colonel, I am sure he would be only too
delighted to hear it from your own lips.

01:43:54.938 --> 01:43:56.856
I think not.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:44:00.902
His behavior
has proved him proud.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:03.905
In the best sense.

01:44:06.616 --> 01:44:09.244
I feel certain
this is the right course.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.002
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

01:44:23.383 --> 01:44:25.593
Mr. Ferrars.

01:44:25.677 --> 01:44:27.595
Miss Dashwood.

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:32.016
Thank you for responding
so promptly to my message.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.519
I was most grateful
to receive it.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.773
Miss Dashwood, God knows
what you must think of me.

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:41.359
Mr. Ferrars- I have no
right to speak, I know.

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:46.281
I have- I have good news.
Do please sit down.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.708
I-I think you know of our
friend, Colonel Brandon.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:58.710
Yes, I've heard his name.

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:01.045
Colonel Brandon
desires me to say...

01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:04.632
that understanding you
wish to join the clergy,

01:45:04.716 --> 01:45:10.054
he has great pleasure in offering you
the parish on his estate at Delaford...

01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:13.558
in the hope that it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:18.396
C-Colonel Brandon?

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:22.108
Yes. He means it as
testimony of his concern...

01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:25.403
for the cruel situation in
which you now find yourselves.

01:45:28.656 --> 01:45:31.576
Colonel Brandon
give me a parish?

01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.163
Can it be possible?

01:45:36.998 --> 01:45:41.919
The unkindness of your family makes you
astonished to find friendship elsewhere.

01:45:44.339 --> 01:45:46.841
No.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:49.844
Not to find it in you.

01:45:49.927 --> 01:45:53.181
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:55.183
I'd- I feel it.

01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:57.518
I would express it if I
could, but, as you know-

01:45:57.602 --> 01:45:59.520
No, no, no.
I am no orator.

01:45:59.604 --> 01:46:02.857
You are mistaken. You owe it
almost entirely to your own merit.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.401
I've had no hand in it.

01:46:09.739 --> 01:46:13.451
Colonel Brandon must be a man of
great worth and respectability.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:16.746
Yes, he is the kindest
and best of men.

01:46:20.875 --> 01:46:25.004
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:31.094
I think he felt it would be
better coming from a friend.

01:46:36.599 --> 01:46:40.520
Your friendship has been the
most important of my life.

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:47.777
You will always have it.

01:46:52.824 --> 01:46:54.784
Forgive me.

01:46:56.369 --> 01:46:58.287
Mr. Ferrars, you honor
your promises.

01:46:58.371 --> 01:47:01.374
That is more important
than anything else.

01:47:01.457 --> 01:47:05.878
I- I wish you both
very happy.

01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:14.512
Miss Dashwood.

01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:50.131
What a stroke of luck for Lucy and Edward
to find a parish so close to Barton.

01:47:50.214 --> 01:47:52.633
You'll all be able
to meet very often.

01:47:52.717 --> 01:47:54.760
That'll cheer you up,
Miss Marianne.

01:47:54.844 --> 01:47:58.347
I have never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby for your sake.

01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:02.727
Insufferable man! To think, we can see his
insufferable house from the top of our hill.

01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:07.315
I shall ask Jackson
to plant some very tall trees.

01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:09.567
You will do nothing of the sort.

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:13.613
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest.

01:48:13.696 --> 01:48:15.615
Made in Paris, no less.

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:29.879
Mrs. Bunting! We're in
desperate need of tea!

01:48:29.962 --> 01:48:32.673
Thank you, Colonel. Bunting,
how glad I am to see you.

01:48:32.757 --> 01:48:35.510
What a journey we've had.
My bones are rattling still.

01:48:39.972 --> 01:48:42.892
I do not think she drew breath
from the moment we left London.

01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:45.186
I should have found
another way of getting home.

01:48:45.269 --> 01:48:47.730
There was no other way.
You said so yourself.

01:48:47.813 --> 01:48:51.359
But I will just take a stroll.
A moment's peace, Elinor.

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:54.487
- I think it is going to rain.
- Miss Dashwood, come and have some tea!

01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:56.364
No, no.
It will not rain.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:58.699
You always say that,
and then it always does.

01:48:58.783 --> 01:49:02.620
I shall keep to the garden,
near the house.

01:49:05.957 --> 01:49:09.335
How can you say such a thing?

01:49:22.265 --> 01:49:25.059
We are very proud of our
little Thomas, Colonel.

01:49:25.142 --> 01:49:28.229
And his papa has such
a way with him.

01:49:28.312 --> 01:49:31.607
I have seldom seen a father
take to a child so.

01:49:31.691 --> 01:49:34.819
Do not fear, Mrs. Bunting.
It's perfectly safe.

01:49:41.659 --> 01:49:43.536
Ooh! Hush.

01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:45.204
There you are, Miss Dashwood.

01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:48.958
Come and meet little Thomas.

01:50:04.515 --> 01:50:06.434
I cannot see Marianne.

01:50:06.517 --> 01:50:09.604
There.

01:50:46.265 --> 01:50:48.726
Love is not love...

01:50:48.809 --> 01:50:51.979
which alters
when it alteration finds,

01:50:53.397 --> 01:50:56.651
or bends with the remover
to remove.

01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:00.071
No.

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:03.824
It is an ever-fixed mark...

01:51:03.908 --> 01:51:06.160
that looks on tempests...

01:51:06.243 --> 01:51:08.996
and is never shaken.

01:51:11.165 --> 01:51:13.084
Willoughby.

01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:17.588
Willoughby.

01:51:19.131 --> 01:51:22.009
Willoughby.

01:51:25.221 --> 01:51:27.848
Marianne?

01:51:27.932 --> 01:51:31.018
She'll be wet through
when she returns.

01:51:31.102 --> 01:51:33.521
Thank you for pointing
that out, my dear.

01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:38.776
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

01:51:38.859 --> 01:51:41.779
I think we can all
guess where she went.

01:51:50.663 --> 01:51:53.124
Miss Dashwood.
Thank you.

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:12.226
Marianne!

01:52:12.309 --> 01:52:16.063
She's not hurt,
but we must get her warm.

01:52:16.147 --> 01:52:18.065
Charlotte.

01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:20.776
The fire is lit
in my room. Do hurry.

01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:25.030
- Higgins, fetch us some blankets.
- Blankets.

01:52:25.114 --> 01:52:27.032
And brandy.

01:52:47.678 --> 01:52:49.597
Miss Dashwood.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.141
I think Marianne
may need a doctor.

01:52:56.228 --> 01:52:57.730
Yes.

01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:15.831
You'll wear yourself out,
Colonel.

01:53:15.915 --> 01:53:19.919
Do not worry. A day or two in bed
will soon set her to rights.

01:53:20.002 --> 01:53:24.256
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

01:53:26.509 --> 01:53:28.427
What is the diagnosis?

01:53:28.511 --> 01:53:31.597
It is an infectious fever that has
taken far more serious hold...

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.183
than I would have expected
in one so young.

01:53:34.266 --> 01:53:38.229
I would recommend the hasty removal
of your child, Mrs. Palmer.

01:53:38.312 --> 01:53:40.439
Mrs. Bunting!
Mrs. Bunting!

01:53:48.322 --> 01:53:50.991
My dear Miss Dashwood.

01:53:51.075 --> 01:53:53.828
I am more sorry than I can say.

01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:56.664
If you'd prefer me to stay,
I am at your service.

01:53:57.790 --> 01:54:00.543
Mr. Palmer,
that is very kind.

01:54:00.626 --> 01:54:04.588
But Colonel Brandon and Dr.
Harris will look after us.

01:54:04.672 --> 01:54:07.216
Thank you for everything
you have done.

01:54:35.953 --> 01:54:38.873
She is not doing as well
as I would like.

01:54:54.305 --> 01:54:56.265
What can I do?

01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:01.061
Colonel, you have done
so much already.

01:55:01.145 --> 01:55:05.232
Give me an occupation, Miss
Dashwood, or I shall run mad.

01:55:05.316 --> 01:55:08.235
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

01:55:09.361 --> 01:55:11.530
Of course.

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:56.241
I must fetch more laudanum.

01:55:56.325 --> 01:55:58.786
I cannot pretend, Miss Dashwood,

01:55:58.869 --> 01:56:02.539
that your sister's condition
is not very serious.

01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:11.048
You must prepare yourself.

01:56:12.132 --> 01:56:15.302
I will return very shortly.

01:56:32.403 --> 01:56:35.072
Marianne?

01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:37.074
Marianne, please try.

01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:42.579
Marianne.

01:56:45.457 --> 01:56:48.002
Please, try.

01:56:55.342 --> 01:56:58.095
I-

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:02.808
I cannot-

01:57:02.891 --> 01:57:05.310
I cannot do without you.

01:57:07.104 --> 01:57:10.024
Please.

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.488
I- I have tried to bear
everything else.

01:57:16.572 --> 01:57:18.490
I will try.

01:57:20.117 --> 01:57:23.245
Please, dearest.

01:57:28.042 --> 01:57:30.044
Beloved Marianne.

01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:37.092
Do not leave me alone.

01:59:01.135 --> 01:59:03.053
My mother.

01:59:10.435 --> 01:59:12.646
Mama? Mama.

01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:15.732
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

01:59:21.738 --> 01:59:24.616
There, there, my love.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.036
My-
my Marianne.

01:59:30.038 --> 01:59:32.291
Where is Elinor?
I'm here.

01:59:33.083 --> 01:59:35.419
Dearest, I am here.

01:59:40.048 --> 01:59:42.926
Colonel Brandon.

01:59:50.225 --> 01:59:52.060
Thank you.

02:00:20.464 --> 02:00:22.549
"Or weigh the thought...

02:00:22.633 --> 02:00:25.928
that from man's mind doth flow.

02:00:26.011 --> 02:00:30.891
But if the weight of these
thou canst not show,

02:00:30.974 --> 02:00:33.894
weigh but one word which
from thy lips doth fall."

02:00:35.687 --> 02:00:38.065
He certainly is not
so dashing as Willoughby.

02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:42.069
But he has a far more
pleasing countenance.

02:00:42.152 --> 02:00:44.947
There always was a something,
if you remember,

02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:47.991
in Willoughby's eyes at times
that I did not like.

02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:52.246
"It is no more at all.

02:00:52.329 --> 02:00:56.208
Nor is the earth the lesse,
or loseth aught.

02:00:56.291 --> 02:01:00.087
For whatsoever
from one place doth fall...

02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:03.257
is with the tide
unto another brought.

02:01:05.175 --> 02:01:07.928
For there is nothing lost...

02:01:08.011 --> 02:01:10.013
but may be found...

02:01:11.473 --> 02:01:13.433
if sought."

02:01:18.605 --> 02:01:21.149
Shall we continue tomorrow?

02:01:21.233 --> 02:01:23.652
No, for I must away.

02:01:23.735 --> 02:01:26.113
Away? Where?

02:01:27.239 --> 02:01:31.660
That, I cannot tell you.
It is a secret.

02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:38.500
You will not stay away long?

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.228
There.

02:02:00.564 --> 02:02:03.567
There I fell, and there
I first saw Willoughby.

02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.906
Poor Willoughby. He
will always regret you.

02:02:11.616 --> 02:02:15.912
But does it follow that had he chosen
me, he would have been content?

02:02:17.372 --> 02:02:22.085
He would have had a wife
he loved, but no money,

02:02:22.169 --> 02:02:25.005
and might soon have learned to rank
the demands of his pocketbook...

02:02:25.088 --> 02:02:27.758
far above the demands
of his heart.

02:02:32.179 --> 02:02:36.266
If his present regrets are half as
painful as mine, he will suffer enough.

02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:40.187
Do you compare your conduct
with his?

02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:42.189
No.

02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:46.610
I compare it with what
it ought to have been.

02:02:47.819 --> 02:02:50.572
I compare it with yours.

02:02:55.619 --> 02:02:59.456
<i>Sans cesse adorer vos attraits.</i>

02:03:01.541 --> 02:03:05.379
Thomas. I fetched those beef
fillets for you, ma'am.

02:03:07.464 --> 02:03:11.510
Beef is far less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:16.056
Was Exeter crowded, Thomas?
It was indeed, ma'am.

02:03:16.139 --> 02:03:19.810
I spoke to Mrs. Braintree and she told me
that Miss Pothington's had another stroke.

02:03:19.893 --> 02:03:23.063
She has no sense or feeling.

02:03:23.146 --> 02:03:27.234
Miss Murden has been obliged to turn
away Coles for his drunkenness.

02:03:27.317 --> 02:03:30.737
And Mr. Ferrars is married, but
of course you know that, ma'am.

02:03:30.821 --> 02:03:33.281
But, Elinor,
I thought-

02:03:36.243 --> 02:03:39.329
Who told you that Mr. Ferrars
was married, Thomas?

02:03:39.413 --> 02:03:41.748
I seen Mrs. Ferrars myself,
ma'am.

02:03:41.832 --> 02:03:43.875
Miss Lucy Steele as was.

02:03:43.959 --> 02:03:46.837
She and Mr. Ferrars were stopping
in a chaise at the New London Inn.

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.923
I happened to look up as I passed
by and I see it was Miss Steele.

02:03:50.006 --> 02:03:54.928
So I took off my hat and she inquired after
you, ma'am, and all you young ladies,

02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:56.930
especially Miss Dashwood,

02:03:57.013 --> 02:04:01.435
and bid me to give you her and Mr.
Ferrars's best compliments and service...

02:04:01.518 --> 02:04:04.938
and how they'd be sure
to send you a piece of the cake.

02:04:06.356 --> 02:04:10.026
Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
Yes, Miss Marianne.

02:04:10.110 --> 02:04:12.028
She said
she was vastly contented.

02:04:12.112 --> 02:04:17.117
And since she was always a very affable
young lady, I made free to wish her joy.

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.161
Thank you, Thomas.

02:04:48.857 --> 02:04:51.651
It's for us!

02:04:51.735 --> 02:04:53.236
What is it, Thomas?

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:56.072
I'm not sure, ma'am,
but it's right heavy.

02:04:56.156 --> 02:04:59.868
"At last I have found a small enough
instrument to fit the parlor.

02:04:59.951 --> 02:05:04.122
I shall follow in a day or two by which time
I expect you to have learnt the enclosed.

02:05:04.206 --> 02:05:06.374
Your devoted friend,
Christopher Brandon."

02:05:06.458 --> 02:05:08.877
My darling, look.
It is beautiful.

02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.921
It fits perfectly.

02:05:12.714 --> 02:05:15.425
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

02:05:16.092 --> 02:05:17.761
Fetch some tea.

02:05:18.678 --> 02:05:20.847
He must like you very much.

02:05:20.931 --> 02:05:24.559
It is not just for me.
It is for all of us.

02:06:12.774 --> 02:06:14.526
Here is Colonel Brandon,
Marianne.

02:06:26.162 --> 02:06:28.290
I do not think
it is the colonel.

02:06:28.373 --> 02:06:31.209
It must be. He said
he would arrive today.

02:06:31.293 --> 02:06:34.754
You must play your new song
to him, Marianne. Edward!

02:06:34.838 --> 02:06:38.383
It is Edward!

02:06:41.845 --> 02:06:44.681
Calm. We must be calm.

02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:50.437
Edward's here.
Sit down.

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:53.440
Sit down.
Shh, and not a word.

02:06:58.069 --> 02:07:00.697
Good afternoon, Mr. Ferrars.
Good afternoon.

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:03.867
Are the ladies at home? They are
indeed, sir. Come this way.

02:07:06.703 --> 02:07:08.872
Mr. Ferrars
for you, ma'am.

02:07:13.293 --> 02:07:15.545
Edward.

02:07:15.629 --> 02:07:17.631
What a pleasure to see you.

02:07:17.714 --> 02:07:19.633
Mrs. Dashwood.

02:07:20.884 --> 02:07:23.511
Miss Marianne, Margaret.

02:07:23.595 --> 02:07:25.513
Miss Dashwood.

02:07:34.898 --> 02:07:36.983
I trust I find you all well.

02:07:37.067 --> 02:07:39.361
Thank you, Edward.

02:07:39.444 --> 02:07:41.529
We are all very well.

02:07:46.242 --> 02:07:49.496
We have been enjoying
very fine weather.

02:07:49.579 --> 02:07:51.498
Well, we have.

02:07:52.999 --> 02:07:57.712
I-I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very... dry.

02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:05.929
May I wish you
great joy, Edward.

02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:09.391
Thank you.

02:08:24.614 --> 02:08:28.576
I hope you have left
Mrs. Ferrars well.

02:08:31.454 --> 02:08:34.416
T-T-Tolerably.
Thank you.

02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:42.424
I- Is Mrs. Ferrars
at the new parish?

02:08:43.842 --> 02:08:47.220
No, no.
No, my-my mother is in town.

02:08:47.303 --> 02:08:51.850
I meant to inquire
after Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

02:08:55.311 --> 02:08:59.441
But then you-
You've not heard?

02:09:02.235 --> 02:09:05.488
I think- I think you mean my brother.
You mean Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

02:09:07.449 --> 02:09:10.076
Mrs. Robert Ferrars?

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:12.162
Yes.

02:09:13.496 --> 02:09:15.457
I, um-

02:09:16.666 --> 02:09:20.754
I-I received a letter
from Miss Steele, um-

02:09:20.837 --> 02:09:22.881
Mrs. Ferrars,
I should say-

02:09:22.964 --> 02:09:27.427
um, communicating to me the, um,

02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:29.929
Th-the transfer
of her affections...

02:09:30.013 --> 02:09:32.348
to my brother Robert.

02:09:32.432 --> 02:09:37.061
Um, it seems they were much
thrown together in-in London.

02:09:37.145 --> 02:09:40.899
And, um, in view of the change
of my circumstances,

02:09:40.982 --> 02:09:43.818
I- I felt it only right...

02:09:43.902 --> 02:09:47.363
that she'd be released
from our engagement.

02:09:48.656 --> 02:09:52.577
At any rate, they were married
last week and are now in Plymouth.

02:09:58.625 --> 02:10:00.543
Then you...

02:10:03.379 --> 02:10:05.298
are not married?

02:10:06.716 --> 02:10:08.635
No.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.081
Elinor.

02:10:40.416 --> 02:10:43.294
Elinor, I met Lucy
when I was very young.

02:10:43.378 --> 02:10:45.797
Had I had an active profession,
I should never have felt...

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.634
such an idle and foolish
inclination.

02:10:49.717 --> 02:10:53.346
My behavior at Norland
was very wrong.

02:10:53.429 --> 02:10:57.100
But I convinced myself
that you felt only friendship for me...

02:10:57.183 --> 02:11:00.979
and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

02:11:01.062 --> 02:11:04.691
I-I've come here
with no expectations.

02:11:04.774 --> 02:11:08.361
Only to profess, now that
I am at liberty to do so,

02:11:09.445 --> 02:11:11.364
that my heart is...

02:11:13.241 --> 02:11:15.660
and always will be...

02:11:17.412 --> 02:11:19.455
yours.

02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:31.301
Go up in the tree house.

02:11:33.469 --> 02:11:35.388
He's sitting next to her.

02:11:35.471 --> 02:11:37.807
Margaret, come down.
Will you stop that!

02:11:37.891 --> 02:11:39.809
What else? What else? Marianne.

02:11:39.893 --> 02:11:42.854
Tell us!
Wait!

02:11:42.937 --> 02:11:45.148
He's kneeling down!

02:11:45.231 --> 02:11:49.819
Is he?

02:13:06.312 --> 02:13:11.234
Throw the coins!
Throw the coins!

02:13:11.317 --> 02:13:15.029
Throw the coins!
Throw the coins!

02:13:15.113 --> 02:13:19.409
Throw the coins!
Throw the coins!

02:13:19.492 --> 02:13:23.579
Throw the coins!
Throw the coins!
