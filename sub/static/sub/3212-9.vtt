00:17.951 --> 00:19.118
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.120 --> 00:21.453
(cow mooing)
Look what I did.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.957
Big news, everyone! I'm finally
moving in with my husband!

00:24.959 --> 00:26.291
Isn't this great?

00:26.293 --> 00:27.993
The best.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.062
(quiet whirring,
filtered breathing)

00:32.665 --> 00:34.733
(sighs)

00:37.837 --> 00:39.905
(sighs)

00:42.075 --> 00:44.009
Carol...

00:44.011 --> 00:47.579
Carol!
(muffled): Huh... huh?

00:49.849 --> 00:51.550
Is everything okay?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.652
You were making
that sound again.
All right.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.320
I gotta tighten up the mask.

00:55.322 --> 00:58.190
Just... I like to wear it loose
so I don't get pressure sores.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.559
But it's a... trade-off, huh?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.262
Yeah, yeah-- do you have
to wear that thing all the time?

01:03.264 --> 01:06.899
Oh, Phil-- sleep apnea's
a part of who I am.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.902
Just like dandruff and
aggressive night toots

01:09.904 --> 01:11.670
are a part of who you are.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.671
Okay. Well, fine.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.873
Just please tighten the mask.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.508
Yes, my prince.
Okay.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.944
(chuckles)

01:23.283 --> 01:25.250
Okay.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.286
Mmm.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.388
Mmm, mmm.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.423
Hey, Phil,

01:31.425 --> 01:34.560
living together's
pretty fun, isn't it?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.728
Yeah. Yeah.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.465
Quick good-night kiss?

01:41.067 --> 01:42.367
(grunts, sighs)

01:42.369 --> 01:45.437
(whirring, filtered
breathing resumes)

01:45.439 --> 01:46.572
(muffled):
Good night.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.073
(whirring, filtered breathing)

01:48.075 --> 01:49.775
Good night.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.962
Right...

02:09.964 --> 02:11.230
Carol?

02:11.232 --> 02:14.233
What did you do to the Monet?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.467
Well,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.002
this old thing didn't have
any life in it,

02:17.004 --> 02:19.238
so I painted a fun little dog
on it.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.105
I saw that.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.240
Hi there, little guy.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.741
I call it

02:22.743 --> 02:25.110
<i>Dog Bridge,</i>
<i>by Monet and Carol.</i>

02:25.112 --> 02:26.812
Isn't it better?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.480
No, it is not.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.582
Please don't paint
on my paintings.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.690
(wry chuckle)

02:42.295 --> 02:43.762
Wait, where are
all my magazines?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.631
Oh, you mean
the dirty magazines.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.299
Yes. Where are those?

02:47.301 --> 02:50.469
They're in the garage in a box
labeled "Molested Girls."

02:50.471 --> 02:54.106
Can you please
not move my stuff anymore?

02:54.108 --> 02:56.475
Phil, we're living together,
so it's no longer "my" stuff

02:56.477 --> 02:59.144
and "your" stuff--
now it's "our" stuff.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.447
Fine. Well, please don't move
"our" dirty magazines anymore

03:02.449 --> 03:04.449
because "we" like them
in this room

03:04.451 --> 03:07.052
where "we" can get at them
more easily.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.954
Well, marriage is
about compromise,

03:08.956 --> 03:11.290
so why don't we meet
in the middle here, huh?

03:11.292 --> 03:14.393
Why don't you try...

03:14.395 --> 03:15.394
this on for size.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.297
A breast exam pamphlet?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.899
Ooh. Do your worst.
(chuckles)

03:20.901 --> 03:22.568
Carol, I don't want
to masturbate

03:22.570 --> 03:24.636
to a breast exam pamphlet!
Phil!

03:24.638 --> 03:27.673
Did you wash your hands
with the decorative hand soap?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.174
That's for company!

03:29.176 --> 03:30.475
What company are we gonna have?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.344
There are only two other people
on Earth!

03:32.346 --> 03:35.314
Well, when they're over here,
they deserve to be pampered.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.882
If you have a problem
with my soap use,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.884
you can go write it up
on the grievance board.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.185
If I can find any room!

03:40.187 --> 03:42.688
It's already filled
with complaints about you.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.057
Well, if I'm so bad, then why
do you want to live with me?

03:45.059 --> 03:47.059
Because you're my husband
and I'm your wife.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.961
And you better get used to it.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.830
Where you going?
To get used to it!

03:51.832 --> 03:54.099
Well, pick up a new attitude
while you're at it.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.567
I will!

03:55.569 --> 03:58.203
Oh, and toilet paper.
(sighs)

03:58.205 --> 03:59.571
Oh, and decorative hand soap.
You know what?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.007
I'm just gonna make a quick
list-- hold on one second.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.911
Stupid shopping list.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.013
(muttering under his breath)

04:17.090 --> 04:19.725
TODD: I'm just evening
it out, up here.
MELISSA: Let me see.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.059
Okay. You ready?
Yes.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.628
Are you sure?
I don't know.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.097
TODD:
Ta-da!
I love it!

04:25.099 --> 04:26.231
I think you look great.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.766
You look great.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.568
Mm...

04:29.570 --> 04:31.570
Look at that.
MELISSA: Cutest couple
on the cul-de-sac.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.172
(Melissa chuckles)

04:38.278 --> 04:39.411
Okay, let's see.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.046
Toilet paper, check.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.115
Decorative hand soap, check.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.916
Paper towels, check.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.985
Coffee filters, check.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.655
Lighter fluid, check.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.193
Matches, check.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.499
There you go, Carol!

05:00.501 --> 05:02.734
I finished
your stupid shopping list!

05:02.736 --> 05:04.469
Will you let me have my life
back now?

05:04.471 --> 05:07.806
Oh, you're just up there
laughing at me, God, aren't you?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.242
Why did you do this?!

05:10.244 --> 05:11.310
Why'd you make it seem

05:11.312 --> 05:13.412
like Carol was the last woman
on Earth

05:13.414 --> 05:15.414
and <i>then</i> introduce me
to Melissa?!

05:15.416 --> 05:18.617
And then you bring freakin' Todd
into the picture?!

05:18.619 --> 05:19.951
Oh, so funny, God!

05:19.953 --> 05:22.020
I forgot to laugh!

05:22.022 --> 05:24.089
So funny.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.859
I was being sarcastic.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.831
If I only knew then
what I know now.

05:32.833 --> 05:37.102
I just wish
I could have a do-over.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.205
I wish I could have a do-over.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.944
(tires screech, engine revs,
vehicle approaching)

05:50.116 --> 05:52.217
(tires screeching)

06:04.030 --> 06:04.996
Oh, my God!
Oh!

06:04.998 --> 06:07.299
This is amazing!

06:07.301 --> 06:09.000
We're not alone!
(chuckles)

06:09.002 --> 06:11.002
I-I'm Gail.
This is Erica.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.206
Oh, my God. Hi-hi, Gail.
Hi, Erica. I'm Phil!

06:14.208 --> 06:15.907
(squeals)
So... so were you
the one who put up

06:15.909 --> 06:17.376
those "Alive in Tucson"
billboards?

06:17.378 --> 06:18.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Those were mine.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.078
I-I... I did that.
(chuckling)

06:20.080 --> 06:21.847
(chuckles)
So, it's
just you?

06:21.849 --> 06:24.282
You're-you're all alone
out here?

06:32.525 --> 06:35.527
Yes. Yes, yes. It's just me.
(chuckling)

06:35.529 --> 06:37.229
It's just me.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.730
Do you mind?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.065
No!
Aw!

06:40.067 --> 06:42.801
(laughing, squealing)

06:46.739 --> 06:48.073
Can't believe
how alone I've been.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.275
You know, just two years,
all by my lonesome.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.877
Oh, you poor thing.
Yeah.

06:51.879 --> 06:55.013
Well, you're not alone anymore.
We're here now.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.849
Yeah. You are.
(chuckles)

06:57.851 --> 06:59.851
Well...

06:59.853 --> 07:03.522
this is us.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.124
(all whooping, laughing)

07:06.126 --> 07:08.727
To a man being alive!
(chuckles)

07:08.729 --> 07:10.228
Alive in Tucson!

07:10.230 --> 07:11.797
And then there were three!
(chuckles)

07:16.035 --> 07:17.536
Mmm!

07:17.538 --> 07:19.104
This champagne
is good!

07:19.106 --> 07:20.972
Oprah quality.
Mm-hmm.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.646
(sighs)

07:27.648 --> 07:29.281
So, uh, tell me
about yourselves.

07:29.283 --> 07:33.051
Erica, do I detect
a little accent?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.119
Yes, you do, Phil.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.887
I thought as much.
(chuckles)

07:35.889 --> 07:37.222
I was born in Sydney

07:37.224 --> 07:40.425
and I moved to Brisbane
and then Adelaide and...

07:40.427 --> 07:42.260
Crikey.
That's a lot of places.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.562
Mmm.
Now, Gail,

07:43.564 --> 07:44.663
how 'bout you?

07:44.665 --> 07:45.897
Oh, I'm just...

07:45.899 --> 07:47.065
a dumb little country girl

07:47.067 --> 07:48.667
from Wilmington, North Carolina.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.671
Now, Gail, I can already tell
that you are <i>very</i> intelligent.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.172
<i>You</i> are

07:54.174 --> 07:56.408
the smart one--
those billboards.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.144
That was genius.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.112
I don't know about genius.
E = MC squared.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.114
"I" before "E" except after "C."
(chuckles)

08:03.116 --> 08:04.182
Sorry, that just popped out.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.283
(all laughing)

08:05.285 --> 08:07.586
Anyway, my hubby and I
had a restaurant

08:07.588 --> 08:09.321
on the waterway there.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.922
Oh, my God.
I love restaurants.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.290
Love waterways, too.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.327
Yeah. And, uh, how did
the two of you guys meet?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.296
Well, after the virus, I started
doing things on my bucket list.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.698
And, um, we ran

08:19.700 --> 08:21.166
into each other
at the White House.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.435
I'm kind of
a political nerd.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.537
Oh, me, too!
Oh, donkeys and elephants.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.273
Love 'em both. Love the process.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.643
So, anyway, we've been
traveling together ever since.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.178
Mm...
ERICA: This is crazy.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.814
We thought we were the only
two people left on Earth.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.215
So I guess,

08:37.217 --> 08:41.553
uh, that's the end
of that... chapter.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.622
(both giggling)

08:45.525 --> 08:47.692
GAIL:
Of course,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.828
maybe Phil's not
even into girls.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.930
(laughing)

08:54.834 --> 08:56.835
"Maybe Phil isn't into girls."

08:56.837 --> 08:58.870
I got news for you, lady.
(chuckles)

08:58.872 --> 09:01.139
I'm v...
Yeah, very much into girls.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.842
Well, I got to have some
more of that champagne

09:03.844 --> 09:05.410
or I'm literally gonna die.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.312
I got it. I got it.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.747
Here you go.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.849
Ooh, Phil.
You were married?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.517
Uh... oh...

09:12.519 --> 09:14.586
well, um...

09:16.055 --> 09:17.222
You don't have to answer.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.224
There's no need to
dredge up the past.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.860
Gail's right.
The past is the past.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.728
To the future.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.599
You know what? I-I should
probably head out for a few.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.867
Oh, no.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.002
Did we scare you off?
Oh, no, no, no.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.537
I just got to go deal
with some stuff.

09:32.539 --> 09:35.507
You know, feed the meter, check
the stove, drop by the bank.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.942
Do you want
to come back for dinner?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.247
I would love to come to dinner.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.381
So...

09:43.383 --> 09:45.350
I will see you guys
in a couple hours.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.986
Uh... to the future.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.197
CAROL:
There you are.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.533
Where have you been?

10:01.535 --> 10:03.902
I've been worried sick
about you.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.071
Uh, just out getting you
your items.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.405
(chuckles)
You got the toilet paper.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.707
Well, that's not all.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.408
I got you everything
on your shopping list, you know.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.110
Uh, and not out
of obligation or guilt.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.445
Definitely not out
of guilt.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.981
Hotel sundries?
I love this stuff!
Yeah.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.484
Wait, Phil, what were you doing
at a hotel?

10:19.486 --> 10:20.919
Meeting your mistress?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.722
(chuckling): Carol...
Oh, oh, Carol... Good one.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.557
(chuckling)

10:25.559 --> 10:26.725
Phil, I'm not a dummy.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.893
We both know
what you were up to today.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.929
We do?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.330
Yeah.

10:33.599 --> 10:36.334
You were finding your smile.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.236
You got out
of the house,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.972
you had a little alone time, and
you started to find your smile.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.407
Yeah.
You know
that term?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.243
Finding your smile?
It's from <i>City Slickers.</i>

10:45.245 --> 10:47.512
The movie <i>City Slickers?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:47.514 --> 10:48.647
Okay.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.281
Bill Crystal's
having some life problems,

10:50.283 --> 10:52.917
so he goes to a dude ranch
to find his smile.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.487
And...?
Oh, he finds it.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.955
Oh, good for him.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.923
Yeah, he just
needed to get away.
Good.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.592
Hmm... you know,

11:00.594 --> 11:02.460
Carol, maybe you're right.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.129
Having a little time
to myself today

11:04.131 --> 11:05.530
really got my juices flowing.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.333
I mean, I'm like a frigging
juice factory right now.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.268
Well, your juices
should never go stagnant.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.503
I mean, they could coagulate.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.672
Yeah! No, they could.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.206
They could, they could.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.876
You know, what if I were to go
do some camping tonight?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.444
You know, get out there and...

11:19.446 --> 11:21.346
and really look at the man
in the mirror?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.481
'Cause I found, like, a little
Mona Lisa smile today.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.284
But I want to find
a real toothy grin, you know?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.186
I say go for it, Phil.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.954
Whatever you're doing,
it's working.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.690
So keep doing it.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.324
I-Is that an order?

11:33.326 --> 11:34.626
Big time!

11:34.628 --> 11:36.528
'Cause when you smile,
I smile.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.463
(chuckles)
Now git.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.998
That's what they
say on the dude ranch.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.366
To the dogies.
(laughs)

11:41.368 --> 11:43.468
Okay, well, see ya,
and I <i>would</i> want to be ya,

11:43.470 --> 11:44.703
'cause you're great.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.005
Oh, thanks, Phil.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.573
Later.
Oh!

11:48.575 --> 11:49.574
What about your camping gear?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.213
Your smile and the moon.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.715
That's my camping gear.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.017
Well, then here's a big one

11:59.019 --> 12:01.419
to get you through the night.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.590
It's a good pic.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.161
(whoops)

12:13.532 --> 12:16.234
Guys, hear me out. I am aware
that, on paper, this whole

12:16.236 --> 12:18.436
Gail and Erica situation
looks super dicey.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.672
But look, I asked God
for a do-over

12:20.674 --> 12:23.108
and then, like, seconds later,
these women showed up.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.610
That seems like an
incredibly clear sign to me.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.947
And Carol specifically asked me
to keep doing what I'm doing.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.751
Now, I know that I withheld
a few key facts from her,

12:32.753 --> 12:35.520
but the bottom line is I think
leading this double life

12:35.522 --> 12:38.256
is gonna make Phil Miller
a better husband to her.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.925
Okay? When I smile, she smiles.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.728
But, look, hey, I want to hear
your take on this, okay?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.897
If you think I'm making
a mistake right now,

12:45.899 --> 12:47.465
please say so.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.267
No?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.635
Nobody?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.737
All right, don't be shy.
This is a free speech zone.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.273
Always has been,
always will be.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.242
All right, okay.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.877
How do I look?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.078
You guys!

13:00.080 --> 13:01.479
Thank you.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.747
(quietly):
I think he's gonna love it.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.649
I think he's gonna love it.
Excuse me, ladies!

13:04.651 --> 13:06.284
We've gotten
a few noise complaints.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.453
Hey!
Phil!

13:08.455 --> 13:09.954
Apparently,
you're being too quiet.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.256
(forced laughter)

13:11.258 --> 13:13.625
Whoa, you ladies
clean up real nice.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.627
Right back
at you, Phil...

13:15.629 --> 13:17.862
wait, what's
your last name?

13:20.399 --> 13:21.933
Cormaneau.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.434
Well, Phil Cormaneau,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.103
shall we adjourn
to the dining room?

13:25.105 --> 13:28.006
I never thought you'd ask.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.611
PHIL: (gasps)
My God, what's all this?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.180
Gail is an amazing chef.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.447
Aren't you sweet.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.950
Wait, are those raisin balls?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.286
God, no, those are Butterfinger
cookie dough truffles.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.087
What are raisin balls?

13:43.089 --> 13:44.789
They're raisins
that have been mushed together

13:44.791 --> 13:46.524
by someone's dirty hands.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.459
Well, that sounds gross.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.161
Who would make
something like that?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.429
Raisin balls?
TODD: Mmm!

13:51.431 --> 13:54.299
I'll definitely
have one of those.
All right.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.134
(giggles)
Well, you know,
the place looks

13:56.136 --> 13:57.335
really nice, Carol.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.469
Thank you, Todd.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.771
I've been working
hard to blend

13:59.773 --> 14:01.539
Phil's and my stuff together

14:01.541 --> 14:03.675
in a way that makes
both of us happy.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.810
Well, I'm sure
Phil's gonna love it.
(chuckles)

14:05.812 --> 14:07.312
Where is Phil?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.781
Camping.
He wanted some alone time.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.816
That's weird.
Oh, I don't know,
Melissa.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.651
You know, camping can be a very
spiritual experience.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.187
God!
Todd, are you in love with Phil?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.488
(laughs)

14:17.490 --> 14:20.158
No, I'm not.
It seems like it sometimes.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.460
I mean, maybe you should be
married to him instead of Carol.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.128
Look, I am just playing
devil's advocate here,

14:24.130 --> 14:25.363
because I feel like, you know,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.631
sometimes you're
a little hard on him.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.999
Well, I don't trust him.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.367
I'm sorry, Carol.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.903
You know I just want
what's best for you.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.138
I know how you feel,
Melissa, but...

14:34.140 --> 14:35.506
I know what I'm doing with him.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.076
And, uh, how much
trouble can he get in?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.310
More tequila?

14:39.312 --> 14:41.212
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Your funeral, buddy.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.047
ERICA: (giggles)
Here we go.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.048
Close your mouth.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.683
(blows whistle)

14:45.685 --> 14:47.652
(whoops)
(laughs)

14:47.654 --> 14:48.853
(whoops, laughs)

14:48.855 --> 14:50.588
(whoops)
(whoops)

14:50.590 --> 14:53.858
(whoops)
Oh, my God, this
guy is amazing.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.861
I'm so glad that
the last man on Earth is fun.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.229
I'm just relieved
that he's cute.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.031
(chuckling)
Right back at you.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.266
Mmm!
Oh, this is good!

15:01.268 --> 15:03.368
(laughing)

15:03.370 --> 15:06.905
Mmm, mmm...
(Erica laughing)

15:06.907 --> 15:09.374
Oh, oh.
(Erica moaning)

15:09.376 --> 15:11.242
Oh... (laughs softly)

15:11.244 --> 15:12.777
Yes.
Mmm.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.913
You guys are
liking that food, huh?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.514
(both giggle)

15:16.516 --> 15:18.516
So, Phil, what'd you think

15:18.518 --> 15:20.752
when we first
popped out of that car?

15:20.754 --> 15:23.354
Were you like, "Uh-oh!

15:23.356 --> 15:25.189
Who are these two
crazy ladies?"

15:25.191 --> 15:27.525
(laughs)
As if.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.860
(women laughing)

15:28.862 --> 15:31.095
Oh, my God, no, it was like a...
like a dream.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.630
Talk about a bucket list.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.932
You got a
hot older lady, black girl.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.601
Ooh! Yes, please.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.403
Don't mind if I do.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.638
Older lady?

15:42.374 --> 15:45.076
Glad my skin color matched up
to your bucket list.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.312
(stammers)

15:47.314 --> 15:49.580
I-I didn't... You know,
I didn't mean it

15:49.582 --> 15:51.950
the-the way that it,
uh, seems. Appar...

15:51.952 --> 15:54.218
Uh, like, I'm...
I did not mean it like that.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.254
Well, then
how did you mean it, Phil?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.790
You know, I meant it,
like, you know,

15:58.792 --> 16:02.093
uh... Wh-Wh...
It-It, uh... You know,

16:02.095 --> 16:03.962
an extremely attractive,

16:03.964 --> 16:07.065
uh, experienced,
age-neutral

16:07.067 --> 16:08.433
woman, and-and

16:08.435 --> 16:09.600
another, you know,

16:09.602 --> 16:12.971
regardless of skin color...
uh, black...

16:12.973 --> 16:14.339
woman.
You know, I-I don't even

16:14.341 --> 16:15.840
know that you're black.
I don't... I-I...

16:15.842 --> 16:17.675
You know, I don't know...
Do... How do I know?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.277
What are you?
I don't know.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.445
You know?
What are all of us?

16:20.447 --> 16:24.349
Wow, this sure took a turn.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.420
I'm so sorry.
I screwed up.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.290
I screwed up. I-I...
You deserve to know the truth.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.791
The truth about what?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.493
A-About Carol.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.861
Who's Carol?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.597
My wife.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.699
Phil's a good person, Melissa.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.800
Well, if he
makes you happy, Carol,

16:42.802 --> 16:43.935
that's good enough for me.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.169
He does make me happy.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.138
Sure, he does
some weird stuff

16:47.140 --> 16:50.475
at times, but his heart's
in the right place.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.311
Yeah, Carol is my wife.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.481
Well... <i>was</i> my wife.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.816
She passed away many moons ago.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.917
Oh.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.321
She died a long,
protracted death.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.323
And, uh, you know,

17:05.325 --> 17:08.326
I nursed her through it.
Every step of the way.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.894
(sighs)
I was there for her.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.829
And there were
many steps.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.464
I'm just that kind of person.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.666
Oh. Awful.

17:15.668 --> 17:16.701
That's terrible.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.036
Yeah, sometimes I'd be

17:18.038 --> 17:20.038
tamping her forehead
with a cool cloth,

17:20.040 --> 17:22.373
and she'd look up to me
and she'd say,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.242
through her oxygen mask:

17:24.244 --> 17:26.644
"Phil, you're the best thing

17:26.646 --> 17:28.312
that's ever happened to me."

17:28.314 --> 17:30.748
(crying quietly)
Aw...

17:30.750 --> 17:32.350
dear...
Oh, my God, Phil.
Oh, my God.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.318
She said that.
Thank you. That feels good.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.486
Mm.
That feels good.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.823
At the end of her life,
she told me...

17:38.825 --> 17:41.492
she said, "Phil...

17:41.494 --> 17:43.928
"get out there,
meet other women,

17:43.930 --> 17:45.196
"find your smile.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.165
"Ball's in your court.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.400
I'm dying. I'm almost dead."

17:49.402 --> 17:51.936
I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.872
'Cause whenever I see
a single woman...

17:54.874 --> 17:56.841
I'm thinking
about her in her coffin.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.376
(high-pitched sobbing)

17:58.378 --> 18:00.044
We will get you through this.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.746
We're here for you, Phil.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.714
Mm.
Mm.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.216
Hey, Care Bear?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.851
That's what I used to call her.
Mm.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.319
Smile found.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.726
Hey, sorry again for
bringing down the party

18:15.728 --> 18:17.929
with my true story
about my dead wife.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.230
I have an idea

18:19.232 --> 18:21.265
about how to get this party
back on track.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.301
Let's all go skinny-dipping

18:23.303 --> 18:24.435
down at the hot springs.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.870
(Erica laughs)

18:25.872 --> 18:28.072
You are crazy.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.408
A warning, Phil,
this lady will have you

18:30.410 --> 18:33.111
doing things that you
never thought you'd do.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.113
(laughs)
So, how about it,

18:35.115 --> 18:36.814
Phil-- are you in?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.883
(chuckling quietly)

18:44.123 --> 18:46.357
(sighs)

18:48.093 --> 18:49.594
Race you to the car.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.895
Aah!
(whoops)

18:50.897 --> 18:52.997
(all laughing, whooping)

18:58.303 --> 18:59.737
Oh, that's nice
decorative soap.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.005
Oh, thank you.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.907
Phil got that for me
today, from a hotel.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.108
Wasn't that sweet?

19:04.110 --> 19:07.311
There, you see?
Now, that's a good guy.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.614
You know, we should
do something nice for Phil.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.283
Show him our appreciation
for everything he's done for us.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.652
That's a great idea, Todd.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.588
Phil deserves a little
random act of kindness

19:17.590 --> 19:19.790
with a side of
senseless act of beauty.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.092
(laughs)

19:21.094 --> 19:22.460
What do you say,
Melissa?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.529
I think you guys
have had too much wine.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.596
Oh, you know what we should do?

19:25.598 --> 19:26.864
We should go to the party store,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.432
fill the whole house
with balloons.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.800
Yes, yes, yes!

19:29.802 --> 19:31.269
I love it!
(laughs)

19:31.271 --> 19:33.037
Race you to the car.
Okay!

19:35.541 --> 19:37.608
(Phil, Gail and Erica laughing)

19:39.378 --> 19:40.778
I love hot springs.
Yeah.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.146
They're better
than cold springs.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.782
(all laughing)

19:44.784 --> 19:46.284
Phil, just to save
a little time,

19:46.286 --> 19:48.386
why don't you go ahead
and get those pants off?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.388
Carol would've wanted me
to get these pants off.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.722
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.826
Wait, what's that?

19:55.828 --> 19:56.827
Holy balls,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.996
it's another car.
No...

19:58.998 --> 20:01.165
No, those are lightning bugs.
We get 'em here all the time.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.833
Flash your lights,
flash your lights.
No, no, no, no, no! No!

20:02.835 --> 20:04.535
(Erica gasps)
They flashed back!

20:04.537 --> 20:06.304
ERICA:
Oh, can you believe it, Phil?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.539
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...
More people must've seen
your billboards.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.974
no, no, no, no, no...

20:09.976 --> 20:12.243
no, no...
Wow.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.981
Oh... Oh!

20:16.983 --> 20:19.750
Oh.
Goodness. (laughs)

20:19.752 --> 20:21.886
(shrieking, laughing)

20:21.888 --> 20:23.254
Hello!

20:23.256 --> 20:24.822
I guess a hug is in order.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.157
(all laughing)

20:26.159 --> 20:27.692
Oh, my gosh.
Well, hi.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.926
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.528
Oh, wow.
Wha... I...

20:30.530 --> 20:31.862
I'm Carol.
I'm Carol.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.830
Todd!
I'm Gail.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.065
I'm Erica.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.566
GAIL: We've gone months
without seeing anyone,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.902
and then we meet
four new people,
all in one day.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.071
You have to meet our-our
nice young man friend.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.572
We were just going
skinny-dipping.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.708
Ow, yow!
(laughs)

20:43.710 --> 20:45.176
Come on!
TODD: Yeah.

20:45.178 --> 20:46.944
Hey.
Hey.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.747
What you doing
in there?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.415
Open up.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.017
What is...
what is he doing?

20:53.019 --> 20:54.919
What is he do...
(laughing)

20:54.921 --> 20:56.454
Hey!

21:00.292 --> 21:01.425
Phil?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.527
Wait, you know Phil?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.630
Phil's my husband.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.767
Surprise.
