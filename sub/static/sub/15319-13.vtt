WEBVTT

00:00.537 --> 00:01.936
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

00:02.246 --> 00:03.646
I've just shut down Wall Street

00:03.648 --> 00:04.848
for 12 minutes.

00:04.850 --> 00:05.749
I'm Caleb.

00:05.751 --> 00:06.818
As in Hollow Earth Caleb?

00:06.820 --> 00:07.787
The most wanted man,

00:07.789 --> 00:09.789
according to
human authorities.

00:09.791 --> 00:11.326
<i>Aiding and abetting</i>
<i>a known terrorist</i>

00:11.328 --> 00:12.561
<i>is tantamount to treason.</i>

00:12.563 --> 00:14.830
Caleb wants to end
this conflict,

00:14.832 --> 00:16.665
as do the other
Hollow Earth abnormals.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.368
We're making
a Homeland for them,

00:18.370 --> 00:19.804
starting immediately.

00:19.806 --> 00:21.505
You know I've always wanted
to be free.

00:21.507 --> 00:23.173
This is my chance.

00:23.175 --> 00:24.309
So you've made your decision.

00:24.311 --> 00:27.212
This is my home now.

00:27.214 --> 00:29.316
The Fifth Ward is becoming
ground zero in this war.

00:29.318 --> 00:31.184
Your boss just signed up
with the enemy.

00:31.186 --> 00:32.384
You're coming to work for me.

00:32.387 --> 00:34.221
This could actually
be useful,

00:34.223 --> 00:36.222
you working at SCIU,

00:36.224 --> 00:37.490
inside the belly of the beast,
so to speak.

00:37.492 --> 00:38.491
Your first assignment

00:38.493 --> 00:40.826
is to arrest
and detain Helen Magnus.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.532
Get out of the car!

00:47.534 --> 00:50.668
You really don't
want to do this, Will.

00:50.670 --> 00:51.736
You left me no choice.

00:53.538 --> 00:54.572
Magnus, don't do this.

00:54.574 --> 00:55.407
Sorry, Will.

01:01.281 --> 01:03.616
What the hell's
going on, Addison?

01:03.618 --> 01:04.818
Been in the planning
stages for a long time,

01:04.819 --> 01:06.421
just never seemed
logistically feasible.

01:06.423 --> 01:08.923
I mean, how do you coax
a large number of abnormals

01:08.925 --> 01:10.726
into one condensed area

01:10.728 --> 01:13.162
away from prying civilian eyes?

01:13.164 --> 01:14.664
Homeland...

01:14.666 --> 01:15.531
- <i>- We are live on the scene</i>

01:15.533 --> 01:16.766
<i>of what authorities are calling</i>

01:16.768 --> 01:18.200
<i>the largest</i>
<i>toxic industrial spill</i>

01:18.202 --> 01:19.668
<i>in recent history.</i>

01:19.670 --> 01:21.136
When did this
become a police state?

01:21.138 --> 01:22.471
It's always been
a police state, Will,

01:22.473 --> 01:23.939
you just never noticed.

01:23.941 --> 01:25.407
They just turned it
into a prison.

01:25.409 --> 01:27.475
Of course they have.

01:27.477 --> 01:28.843
Doc, where are you going?

01:28.845 --> 01:31.613
<i>This district</i>
<i>is full of strange beings</i>

01:31.615 --> 01:34.715
<i>who have lived among us</i>
<i>for hundreds of years.</i>

01:34.717 --> 01:36.517
What the hell is that
crazy broad doing now?

01:36.519 --> 01:37.618
<i>I call them abnormals.</i>

01:37.620 --> 01:38.620
Oh, Magnus...

01:38.622 --> 01:40.822
<i>You know them as monsters,</i>

01:40.824 --> 01:44.460
<i>and they very much exist.</i>

01:46.730 --> 01:48.632
I'm going to have to
call you back, General.

01:48.634 --> 01:50.234
Addison.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.770
Yes, Mr. President,
I'm sorry,

01:52.772 --> 01:54.004
I was just on with
the Joint Chiefs.

01:55.374 --> 01:56.608
I understand, sir.

01:56.610 --> 01:58.843
We're working up
scenarios right now.

02:00.346 --> 02:03.416
You will be my first call.

02:05.619 --> 02:07.621
I'm not even going
to bother asking

02:07.623 --> 02:08.955
if this was part of her plan.

02:08.957 --> 02:10.957
Oh, I had no idea
this was coming,

02:10.959 --> 02:13.594
but here's the deal,
neither did you.

02:13.596 --> 02:15.763
Trust me, it changes nothing.

02:15.765 --> 02:16.764
We'll bring the media in line.

02:16.766 --> 02:18.666
"Monsters exist"?

02:18.668 --> 02:19.634
Good luck with the spin.

02:19.636 --> 02:21.770
Are you still
not on board here?

02:21.772 --> 02:23.605
After the ass-kicking
she just gave you?

02:23.607 --> 02:25.607
Look...

02:25.609 --> 02:27.776
I'll take getting
beaten up by a girl

02:27.778 --> 02:31.247
over being the fall guy
to this mess any day.

02:34.018 --> 02:35.652
Addison.

02:36.887 --> 02:39.790
No, I assure you, Senator,

02:39.792 --> 02:41.791
we have the situation
well in hand.

02:47.665 --> 02:49.032
Hey.

02:49.034 --> 02:51.668
How's your head?

02:51.670 --> 02:53.002
<i>It'll heal.</i>

02:53.004 --> 02:55.037
My pride, however,
is another story.

02:55.039 --> 02:56.773
Ah, yes, well,
some things can't be helped.

02:56.775 --> 02:58.808
You know, I always said
you were crazy,

02:58.810 --> 03:00.543
but this?

03:00.545 --> 03:02.446
It was vital that Addison
and his agenda be derailed,

03:02.448 --> 03:04.448
at least momentarily.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.584
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>that's happening.</i>

03:06.586 --> 03:08.486
Would you care
to explain why?

03:08.488 --> 03:10.688
Because creating a prison
isn't the final move here.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.524
<i>It will be</i>
<i>something far worse.</i>

03:12.526 --> 03:14.025
Come on,

03:14.027 --> 03:16.427
even Addison
wouldn't go that far.

03:16.429 --> 03:17.662
<i>Oh, the order</i>
<i>won't come from him.</i>

03:17.664 --> 03:18.930
<i>It'll come from</i>
<i>higher up.</i>

03:18.932 --> 03:22.901
Look, I realize this is
intolerable for you,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.469
but I need you to stay focused.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.705
You're in the right place
at the moment.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.307

03:52.632 --> 03:54.132
Operation this size,
the government was ready

03:54.134 --> 03:56.067
long before we helped Caleb
set up shop here.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.368
Oh, I'm sure
they've been ready

03:57.370 --> 03:59.904
to seal off any insurgent-held
area for months now.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.705
Anywhere, anytime.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.741
I just thought we'd have
more time to negotiate

04:03.743 --> 04:04.942
before they acted.

04:04.944 --> 04:05.842
And now,
with us going public,

04:05.844 --> 04:06.776
it's only going
to get worse.

04:06.778 --> 04:08.812
Or not.

04:08.814 --> 04:10.179
To be effective,

04:10.181 --> 04:12.714
SCIU needs to operate
away from public scrutiny.

04:12.716 --> 04:14.516
The media
prying into Old City now...

04:14.518 --> 04:16.485
They can't move in
and arrest anyone.

04:16.487 --> 04:18.386
Or worse.

04:19.721 --> 04:20.822
What does that mean?

04:20.824 --> 04:22.991
I was in Poland in 1943

04:22.993 --> 04:25.893
when the Nazis entered
the Warsaw ghetto.

04:25.895 --> 04:27.995
I watched them
raze it to the ground.

04:27.997 --> 04:32.065
Thousands dead,
the rest sent to death camps.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.833
Walling people in

04:33.835 --> 04:36.737
is always
the first step.

04:36.739 --> 04:40.441
They will not allow
this Homeland to exist, Henry,

04:40.443 --> 04:41.442
and trust me,

04:41.444 --> 04:43.011
history always repeats.

04:43.013 --> 04:45.414
What about the big guy?
Kate?

04:45.416 --> 04:46.615
They'll be fine
for the moment,

04:46.617 --> 04:47.950
but I need you and Nikola

04:47.952 --> 04:49.485
to find out
what SCIU's next move is,

04:49.487 --> 04:51.888
including their version
of the "final solution."

04:51.890 --> 04:53.056
We can't let that happen.

04:57.995 --> 04:59.462
<i>Rough day, Greg?</i>

05:00.932 --> 05:02.564
<i>Aw, she's a pistol, ain't she?</i>

05:02.566 --> 05:04.599
What is this about, Fortis?

05:04.601 --> 05:05.767
<i>Just want to bring</i>
<i>a little light</i>

05:05.769 --> 05:07.835
<i>into a dark day.</i>

05:07.837 --> 05:10.738
<i>All that tech</i>
<i>you leached from Tesla,</i>

05:10.740 --> 05:12.039
<i>well, my friend,</i>

05:12.041 --> 05:13.707
<i>you've impressed</i>
<i>some very important people.</i>

05:13.709 --> 05:15.075
<i>They want more.</i>

05:15.077 --> 05:17.612
<i>In fact, there's talk</i>
<i>about using it</i>

05:17.614 --> 05:20.048
<i>in conventional combat</i>
<i>operations by Christmas.</i>

05:20.050 --> 05:22.784
I was promised full control
over everything we found,

05:22.786 --> 05:24.419
not to mention

05:24.421 --> 05:26.555
all operations pertaining
to hyperspecies security.

05:26.557 --> 05:27.723
<i>You were</i>
<i>supposed to break</i>

05:27.725 --> 05:29.725
<i>the Hollow Earth</i>
<i>insurgency,</i>

05:29.727 --> 05:31.694
<i>and now it seems</i>

05:31.696 --> 05:33.462
<i>they're having block parties</i>
<i>in the middle of town.</i>

05:34.698 --> 05:36.599
<i>What did you think</i>
<i>was coming?</i>

05:36.601 --> 05:38.200
<i>That you'd just</i>
<i>arrest and detain</i>

05:38.202 --> 05:39.869
<i>a couple of key insurgents,</i>

05:39.871 --> 05:41.303
<i>and the rest would stay behind</i>

05:41.305 --> 05:42.571
<i>and open</i>
<i>a Bed, Bath and Beyond?</i>

05:44.140 --> 05:45.674
<i>Congratulations, Greg,</i>

05:45.676 --> 05:47.809
<i>on failing upwards.</i>

05:59.688 --> 06:02.055
We need to talk, sport.

06:06.061 --> 06:09.730
What if I was to tell you
I was getting boned from above,

06:09.732 --> 06:13.767
that I don't have the control
I thought I did?

06:13.769 --> 06:17.538
I'd say, "why
are you telling me?"

06:17.540 --> 06:19.673
I'm going to
make you a deal.

06:21.877 --> 06:24.144
I pull back the curtain
on the B.S. I'm facing

06:24.146 --> 06:25.613
from the Star Chamber,

06:25.615 --> 06:28.516
you tell me
what Magnus is planning.

06:31.052 --> 06:32.954
Come on, Greg,

06:32.956 --> 06:34.555
the scotch isn't that good <i>.</i>

06:41.297 --> 06:44.566
They're going to use
Tesla's containment tech

06:44.568 --> 06:47.069
on a wider scale.

06:47.071 --> 06:48.771
Combat operations,

06:48.773 --> 06:50.740
on humans as well as abnormals.

06:52.576 --> 06:53.643
And what about the Homeland?

06:55.278 --> 06:56.679
Your people aren't going
to let them stay there,

06:56.681 --> 06:58.047
and they're not exactly

06:58.049 --> 06:59.915
going to let us
be their jailors.

06:59.917 --> 07:00.982
There was
a plan in place, Will--

07:00.984 --> 07:01.983
<i>Was?</i>

07:01.985 --> 07:03.918
It changed.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.886
Not my doing.

07:07.189 --> 07:09.090
So you sent the top insurgents
to the chopping block,

07:09.092 --> 07:12.025
and now they're coming
after your head.

07:12.994 --> 07:13.827
You didn't see this coming?

07:13.829 --> 07:15.229
Tell me what Magnus is up to.

07:15.231 --> 07:16.197
Anything I can use.

07:16.199 --> 07:18.032
Well, gee, Greg,

07:18.034 --> 07:20.601
since you <i> renditioned</i> me
from my job,

07:20.603 --> 07:21.969
I don't exactly
have access anymore, do I?

07:21.971 --> 07:23.771
Look...

07:23.773 --> 07:26.074
Whatever happens next,
just remember,

07:26.076 --> 07:27.575
you were on this side of it.

07:27.577 --> 07:31.013
Details mean nothing
to historians.

07:34.651 --> 07:37.086
I'll see you at the Hague, kid.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.921
Maybe we can share a lawyer.

07:38.923 --> 07:44.159
I can't find out
what Magnus is up to

07:44.161 --> 07:45.893
because you locked
the Sanctuary

07:45.895 --> 07:50.264
out of every secure
database in the world.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.733
You want information,
then let me work.

07:52.735 --> 07:54.267
Even if I did unshackle you,

07:54.269 --> 07:56.002
why should I trust
anything you'd bring me?

07:57.839 --> 07:59.340
Loyalty to Harvard.

08:05.616 --> 08:06.682
Well, talk about monsters.

08:24.269 --> 08:26.036
So...

08:26.038 --> 08:27.704
How did that go?

08:30.175 --> 08:32.308
We're in business.

08:34.712 --> 08:37.981
It's no accident
that I trust you, you know.

08:37.982 --> 08:41.683
You've lived in the shadow
of humans for decades.

08:41.686 --> 08:47.156
You possess a balance of respect
and distrust I admire.

08:47.158 --> 08:48.324
Balance...

08:48.326 --> 08:50.392
I'm not so sure
about that anymore.

08:50.394 --> 08:51.760
Well, from what you've said,

08:51.762 --> 08:53.695
you've seen the best
and worst that they can be.

08:53.697 --> 08:54.963
Yeah.

08:54.965 --> 08:56.398
You've seen only the worst.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.334
Give it time.

08:58.336 --> 08:59.835
The tide will turn.

09:04.041 --> 09:05.909
Ah...

09:05.911 --> 09:08.780
That is the reaction
I wanted to see.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.150
I'm not delusional.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.154
I know we're in for
some hard times ahead,

09:15.156 --> 09:17.122
but we are far
from helpless here.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.057
War?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.860
Evolution.

09:38.111 --> 09:42.414
War is conflict,
a waste of life,

09:42.416 --> 09:43.715
but this...

09:46.352 --> 09:47.720
This...

09:47.722 --> 09:49.388
is the future.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.326
A new age is coming,

09:54.328 --> 09:57.362
and it will be
the humans who serve us

09:57.364 --> 09:59.231
when all is said and done.

09:59.233 --> 10:02.234
<i>We will be their Gods.</i>

10:10.428 --> 10:11.494
Look out.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.998
So what are we now,
Al's TV repair shop?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.367
Some Red-Listers I know

10:17.369 --> 10:19.569
ripped this off a barricade
outside the Homeland.

10:19.571 --> 10:21.171
It cost me
a mortgage payment,

10:21.173 --> 10:23.072
but it should give us
a better idea

10:23.074 --> 10:24.140
of what they're using
to keep everyone inside.

10:24.142 --> 10:25.475
Thing looks like

10:25.477 --> 10:26.877
it transfers
a buttload of energy.

10:26.879 --> 10:29.947
Yes, but no
visible output points.

10:29.949 --> 10:30.948
So what is it,

10:30.950 --> 10:32.583
some sort of
communications node?

10:32.585 --> 10:34.085
It looks a honkin'
bit big for that.

10:34.087 --> 10:35.420
A node, yes,

10:35.422 --> 10:36.988
but not for
communications.

10:36.990 --> 10:39.924
For multi-spectrum
containment.

10:39.926 --> 10:43.126
Sound, magnetics, pure energy,
anything you want.

10:43.128 --> 10:44.294
You get enough of these,

10:44.296 --> 10:46.563
you've got the ultimate
invisible dog fence.

10:48.165 --> 10:50.132
And you know this
because--

10:50.134 --> 10:51.500
Because I designed it,
of course.

10:51.502 --> 10:53.569
Oh boy.

10:53.571 --> 10:54.569
It was only
in the blueprint stages

10:54.571 --> 10:55.570
when I left SCIU.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.105
<i>Fired</i> from SCIU.

10:57.107 --> 10:59.307
I left a few key
design elements undone.

10:59.309 --> 11:01.376
You know, thinking
I'd get to it later.

11:01.378 --> 11:02.577
Well, I guess

11:02.579 --> 11:04.012
one of the bright lights
down in the geek squad

11:04.014 --> 11:05.047
figured it out.

11:05.049 --> 11:06.515
And deployed it.

11:06.517 --> 11:08.117
There's, like, hundreds
of these things

11:08.119 --> 11:09.518
encircling
the Homeland district.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.452
Huh... it works.

11:10.454 --> 11:12.854
Listen, it's effective,

11:12.856 --> 11:13.854
but harmless.

11:13.856 --> 11:15.122
So you figured out a way

11:15.124 --> 11:16.390
to keep the connection
between these things

11:16.392 --> 11:17.625
humming along
despite the power surges?

11:17.627 --> 11:20.294
Rotating frequencies
for each node.

11:20.296 --> 11:21.395
Now, the beauty of this

11:21.397 --> 11:23.029
is it can contain

11:23.031 --> 11:24.531
almost any type
of creature.

11:24.533 --> 11:25.599
It was a bitch
to figure out,

11:25.601 --> 11:27.368
let me tell you.

11:28.637 --> 11:30.671
Okay, so riddle me this--

11:30.673 --> 11:31.872
if SCIU decides to pump

11:31.874 --> 11:33.141
50 million gigawatts
of pure electricity

11:33.143 --> 11:34.475
through these things,

11:34.477 --> 11:35.876
making them
talk to each other..?

11:35.878 --> 11:36.877
They wouldn't.

11:36.879 --> 11:38.279
You know that for sure?

11:40.282 --> 11:42.383
Nikola?

11:43.885 --> 11:45.185
Could these be turned into

11:45.187 --> 11:46.720
a giant
electrified web?

11:46.722 --> 11:49.656
Yes. They could.

11:49.658 --> 11:51.258
No incursion, no riots.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.292
One switch, hundreds of bodies.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.028
Dude!

11:54.030 --> 11:56.363
It's not
what it was meant for.

11:56.365 --> 11:59.934
It's not what
it was meant for!

12:08.978 --> 12:10.178
Hey, Doc...

12:10.180 --> 12:12.113
Ah, there she is,

12:12.115 --> 12:13.281
a ray of light

12:13.283 --> 12:15.383
surrounded by
filth and grime.

12:15.385 --> 12:16.251
I see you've met Bruno.

12:16.253 --> 12:17.552
Indeed we have.

12:17.554 --> 12:19.388
And may I say,
there is no one else

12:19.390 --> 12:21.090
I would rather be stuck
in this hell-hole with.

12:22.693 --> 12:23.893
Except for you, of course.

12:23.895 --> 12:26.129
He's been
more than helpful

12:26.131 --> 12:27.263
smuggling supplies,

12:27.265 --> 12:29.499
and certain people,
into the district,

12:29.501 --> 12:30.467
for a price.

12:30.469 --> 12:31.635
You make it sound so cheap.

12:31.637 --> 12:32.836
I have mouths to feed.

12:32.838 --> 12:34.071
And you'll be paid
for your services,

12:34.073 --> 12:35.239
have no fear.

12:35.241 --> 12:36.174
Just so you know,

12:36.176 --> 12:37.275
in this time of crisis,

12:37.277 --> 12:40.111
I'm waiving my usual
service fees, all right?

12:40.113 --> 12:41.545
Expenses, on the other hand,

12:41.547 --> 12:42.647
are a completely
separate matter.

12:42.649 --> 12:44.115
But I'll keep
my receipts,

12:44.117 --> 12:45.717
and I'll just invoice you
directly, or...

12:45.719 --> 12:46.585
I don't know how that...

12:46.587 --> 12:47.820
Whatever, we'll work it out.

12:54.428 --> 12:57.397
You sound
like a politician.

12:57.399 --> 12:58.598
This was an experiment.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.532
We knew
there'd be setbacks.

12:59.534 --> 13:01.133
Setbacks?

13:01.135 --> 13:02.568
More like an act of war.

13:02.570 --> 13:04.503
I promise you,

13:04.505 --> 13:08.441
I had no idea that SCIU
would respond this way.

13:08.443 --> 13:12.312
I realize what this
represents for both of us.

13:12.314 --> 13:14.981
We have to come up
with a new plan.

13:14.983 --> 13:16.416
I know what
you're going to say.

13:16.418 --> 13:18.151
Let me buy you some time,

13:18.153 --> 13:19.519
help get your people to safety,

13:19.521 --> 13:20.487
out of the line of fire.

13:20.489 --> 13:22.989
You mean back underground,

13:22.991 --> 13:24.391
literally.

13:24.393 --> 13:26.426
How is that any worse
than living in a prison?

13:26.428 --> 13:28.728
Hollow Earth is a prison.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.196
That was before.

13:30.198 --> 13:32.465
Now it can be
whatever you choose.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.268
Except a place
where the sun shines,

13:35.270 --> 13:39.239
where there are oceans,
rivers, mountains.

13:39.241 --> 13:41.074
Trade one ghetto for another?

13:41.076 --> 13:42.141
I can't sell that.

13:42.143 --> 13:43.276
There's more.

13:44.812 --> 13:46.279
This entire district
is covered

13:46.281 --> 13:47.513
with an advanced
electrical field

13:47.515 --> 13:48.581
designed to keep you in.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.083
We know.

13:50.085 --> 13:52.118
It works, believe me.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.520
We believe

13:53.522 --> 13:56.290
that SCIU may try
to alter its purpose,

13:56.292 --> 13:59.659
create a powerful,
localized electrical storm

13:59.661 --> 14:00.560
within these walls.

14:03.264 --> 14:04.764
You know this?

14:04.766 --> 14:07.801
I believe it may be
their endgame, yes.

14:09.303 --> 14:13.540
Now do you see
why you have to leave?

14:13.542 --> 14:15.075
We're not leaving.

14:17.044 --> 14:18.611
Then you're all targets
for genocide.

14:18.613 --> 14:22.215
If we run,
we will be found again,

14:22.217 --> 14:24.418
killed off one by one.

14:24.420 --> 14:28.455
Maybe the best way to avoid it
is to make a stand here.

14:28.457 --> 14:29.356
Right now.

14:29.358 --> 14:31.758
Are you really prepared to die

14:31.760 --> 14:33.693
without a single shot
being fired?

14:33.695 --> 14:34.894
Part of a mass execution?

14:34.896 --> 14:35.729
The surface
wasn't created

14:35.731 --> 14:37.298
for humans alone.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.232
We have the same right to exist

14:38.234 --> 14:40.134
as they do.

14:40.136 --> 14:42.103
Inside these walls,

14:42.105 --> 14:43.471
we live as free men,

14:43.473 --> 14:46.374
able to honor our customs
and traditions,

14:46.376 --> 14:47.609
believe what we wish,

14:47.611 --> 14:50.413
and, if it comes to it...

14:51.682 --> 14:54.151
We'll die this way.

14:59.690 --> 15:04.127
Okay, so, crazy,
brave, or both?

15:04.129 --> 15:05.429
I can't tell.

15:05.431 --> 15:06.730
He certainly
seems to believe

15:06.732 --> 15:08.799
that this is
his time and place.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.801
To do what,
become a martyr?

15:10.803 --> 15:12.536
If he has to.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.738
For him,

15:13.740 --> 15:15.707
better to die with honor
than live as a coward.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.310
That is such a load
of macho crap.

15:18.312 --> 15:19.144
Difference of opinion.

15:19.146 --> 15:20.579
I think he's lying.

15:22.149 --> 15:23.549
If his concern
really was

15:23.551 --> 15:25.184
for the safety
of all these people here,

15:25.186 --> 15:27.420
he would have taken me up
on my offer immediately.

15:27.422 --> 15:29.890
He may talk about
death and honor,

15:29.892 --> 15:32.425
but he's a survivor.

15:32.427 --> 15:33.626
Put Bruno on it.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.428
Whatever
Caleb's hiding?

15:35.430 --> 15:38.465
Find it.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.836
Okay, here we go.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.176
Hello.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.544
Oh...

16:22.247 --> 16:23.446
It's you.

16:23.448 --> 16:25.715
Looking for this?

16:25.717 --> 16:27.683
Mouths to feed?

16:28.885 --> 16:31.386
Yeah, the...
Nice blue...

16:31.388 --> 16:34.289
Yeah, I wanted to
test the absorbency

16:34.291 --> 16:35.690
of some paper towels.

16:35.692 --> 16:36.791
I-I...

16:36.793 --> 16:38.759
Stealing from Caleb?

16:38.761 --> 16:40.228
Not a good idea--

16:40.230 --> 16:41.562
Biggie, wait a minute--

16:41.564 --> 16:43.864
you need a lesson in loyalty.

16:54.534 --> 16:56.101
I'm good.

16:57.127 --> 16:59.228
Bruno!

16:59.230 --> 17:00.529
Wow.

17:00.531 --> 17:02.498
That, uh, electrical
force field thing

17:02.500 --> 17:03.499
around the Homeland

17:03.501 --> 17:05.099
is not fun
to fly through.

17:05.102 --> 17:06.234
Are you injured?

17:06.237 --> 17:07.269
No, no, it's good.

17:07.271 --> 17:09.570
I'm just... tingling
in just the right...

17:09.573 --> 17:11.138
No, no, it's good.

17:11.141 --> 17:12.840
I, uh, got
a package for you.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.843
It's from the big guy.

17:14.845 --> 17:17.579
He said that
you needed to see it ASAP.

17:17.580 --> 17:22.684
Yeah... just, um...

17:22.685 --> 17:23.818
My work here is done.

17:40.637 --> 17:42.905
I admit,
you had me fooled.

17:42.907 --> 17:44.773
I really thought
you had gone dark side.

17:44.775 --> 17:48.844
Caleb's a criminal,
just like the rest.

17:48.846 --> 17:50.579
I needed to know
what he was up to.

17:50.581 --> 17:52.747
You couldn't tell me or Magnus.

17:52.749 --> 17:55.617
It's not safe to tell you,

17:55.619 --> 17:57.485
not here.

17:59.522 --> 18:00.588
Buenos Aires.

18:00.590 --> 18:03.891
People died
because of what I did.

18:05.260 --> 18:07.528
He'll find out
you took it.

18:07.530 --> 18:11.699
Yeah. Probably.

18:11.701 --> 18:15.202
So... so I say
let's get out of here

18:15.204 --> 18:16.469
while we still can.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.438
You go.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.706
Caleb's too dangerous
to be left alone.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.743
I have to finish this.

18:37.924 --> 18:40.926
Tokyo, Dallas,
Brisbane, Cape Town.

18:40.928 --> 18:43.496
All just listed their facilities
for sale or lease.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.698
Four Sanctuaries
closed.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.535
That makes 12 in the
last eight months.

18:48.537 --> 18:51.472
It leaves London,
New York, and here.

18:51.474 --> 18:52.973
So what,
she's downsizing?

18:52.975 --> 18:54.975
Well, just because the Feds
are putting the squeeze on us

18:54.977 --> 18:56.977
doesn't mean the need for
the Sanctuary network

18:56.979 --> 18:58.546
goes away.

18:58.548 --> 19:00.615
She's not exactly the type
to buckle under pressure.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.983
No.

19:01.985 --> 19:04.286
Okay, so,

19:04.288 --> 19:06.355
Magnus leaves London
in 1898

19:06.357 --> 19:08.291
for, she claims,

19:08.293 --> 19:09.559
Nepal.

19:09.561 --> 19:10.393
Where does she go after that?

19:10.395 --> 19:12.228
Where would you go?

19:12.230 --> 19:13.395
At the turn of the century?

19:13.397 --> 19:14.763
Anywhere.

19:14.765 --> 19:16.631
Africa, India,
Australia, New York--

19:16.633 --> 19:18.399
New York,

19:18.401 --> 19:20.501
which is where
Tesla is at the time,

19:20.503 --> 19:22.236
working for JP Morgan,

19:22.238 --> 19:24.938
building the Wardenclyffe
Tower on Long Island.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.806
Yeah, but she's
supposed to be hiding,

19:26.808 --> 19:28.341
not interfering
with the timeline.

19:28.343 --> 19:29.742
Yeah, but she's not interfering

19:29.744 --> 19:32.011
if Tesla thinks that
she's the Magnus from that era.

19:32.013 --> 19:34.880
Oh, now, that's sneaky.

19:39.452 --> 19:40.419
Bancroft...

19:40.421 --> 19:41.987
What? What's that?

19:41.989 --> 19:45.391
Bancroft is Magnus's
mother's maiden name.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.459
Why don't you look up
Helen Bancroft?

19:47.461 --> 19:50.630
Start around, like,
I don't know, 1925.

19:50.632 --> 19:52.765
Okay, uh...

19:52.767 --> 19:55.801
Any context?

19:55.803 --> 19:58.004
Engineering, futurism?

19:58.006 --> 20:00.006
Okay... uh...

20:00.008 --> 20:01.440
Helen Bancroft.

20:01.442 --> 20:04.043
Lahore University,
medical fellowship, 1916.

20:04.045 --> 20:05.677
Helen Bancroft,

20:05.679 --> 20:08.447
guest at private symposium
in London,

20:08.449 --> 20:10.349
hosted by Viscount Haldane,

20:10.351 --> 20:11.450
uh, for--

20:11.452 --> 20:14.353
Albert Einstein.

20:14.355 --> 20:16.889
Add to the criteria
Buckminster Fuller.

20:16.891 --> 20:18.925
Okay...

20:18.927 --> 20:21.528
1948, North Carolina.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.763
Helen Bancroft.

20:22.765 --> 20:25.433
Fellowship
at Black Mountain University.

20:25.435 --> 20:29.971
Shared an office with Fuller
for a semester.

20:29.973 --> 20:33.741
Add... Peru, Bolivia,

20:33.743 --> 20:35.443
and Australia.

20:35.445 --> 20:37.411
Helen Bancroft,
on Board of Directors

20:37.413 --> 20:41.015
for Great South American
Mining Corporation, 1956.

20:41.017 --> 20:42.883
And...

20:42.885 --> 20:44.552
A Helen Bancroft opened
a provisions store

20:44.554 --> 20:45.753
in Coober Pedy

20:45.755 --> 20:46.620
in the Australian
Outback

20:46.622 --> 20:48.021
in 1964.

20:48.023 --> 20:49.656
Einstein, Fuller,
South America,

20:49.658 --> 20:51.058
I don't see
the connection.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.960
If this Bancroft woman
is even her.

20:52.962 --> 20:55.396
There's no
photographic evidence.

20:55.398 --> 21:00.468
We won't find any, trust me.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.405
You had Feliz
shut down Wall Street

21:03.407 --> 21:06.475
for 12 minutes...

21:06.477 --> 21:07.777
So you could
liquidate everything

21:07.779 --> 21:11.380
without anyone knowing.

21:11.382 --> 21:14.349
'Cause you're almost done,
aren't you?

21:17.854 --> 21:19.622
Really?

21:19.624 --> 21:21.524
Listen, I told wolf-boy
it wouldn't work,

21:21.526 --> 21:22.525
but did he listen?

21:22.527 --> 21:24.526
No, he went off
to buy new parts.

21:25.928 --> 21:27.528
Well, how are you
coming along?

21:27.530 --> 21:28.529
Well, you were right.

21:28.531 --> 21:30.465
The compounds are
Praxian-based.

21:30.467 --> 21:31.799
Mostly chemicals for air

21:31.801 --> 21:33.701
and waterborne
absorption.

21:33.703 --> 21:34.802
More weapons
of mass destruction.

21:37.006 --> 21:39.408
But what I can't figure
out is its purpose.

21:39.410 --> 21:40.876
What's it meant
to deliver?

21:40.878 --> 21:42.511
There are no toxins,
no parasites,

21:42.513 --> 21:44.580
nothing reactionary at all.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.015
Patience,
patience.

21:46.017 --> 21:49.385
Collating data
as we speak...

21:50.389 --> 21:51.955
Uh-oh.

21:51.957 --> 21:54.090
Well, that
doesn't sound good.

21:54.092 --> 21:56.026
That's recessive DNA

21:56.028 --> 21:59.562
derived from stores
of source blood in Praxis.

21:59.564 --> 22:00.964
You add a <i> soupcon</i>
<i>of genome-binder,</i>

22:00.966 --> 22:02.432
you have something very, very--

22:02.434 --> 22:03.901
Potent.

22:03.903 --> 22:05.969
No wonder he won't
go back to Hollow Earth.

22:05.971 --> 22:09.840
Well, our Caleb has
some mighty big plans.

22:09.842 --> 22:12.609
This vial contains
a replicating virus

22:12.611 --> 22:14.144
that, if released
on a mass scale,

22:14.146 --> 22:16.613
would genetically alter
every human being on Earth.

22:16.615 --> 22:19.750
Bringing their latent
abnormal DNA to the surface.

22:19.752 --> 22:21.518
Brilliant.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.488
Evil, but brilliant.

22:24.490 --> 22:25.856
But this could revive

22:25.858 --> 22:27.691
every hyper-species
that ever lived.

22:27.693 --> 22:29.493
Vampires,
shapeshifters,

22:29.495 --> 22:31.461
even haps.

22:31.463 --> 22:34.498
This would set human
civilization back 2,000 years.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.867
If Caleb succeeds
in spreading this virus...

22:36.869 --> 22:39.670
There won't be a free human
left on Earth.

22:52.941 --> 22:54.709
If you still
want to arrest me,

22:54.711 --> 22:56.744
I'll be very
disappointed.

22:56.746 --> 23:00.181
Coober Pedy, Australia.

23:00.183 --> 23:01.815
Black Mountain, North Carolina?

23:03.485 --> 23:05.352
Buckminster Fuller?

23:05.354 --> 23:06.820
Took you long enough
to figure it out.

23:06.822 --> 23:08.488
That's because someone
didn't trust me

23:08.490 --> 23:09.889
with all
the information.

23:09.891 --> 23:12.392
I didn't trust anyone.

23:12.394 --> 23:15.294
Nikola, Declan, Henry, Kate,
no one knows.

23:15.296 --> 23:18.298
It's supposed to be different
when it's me and you, Magnus.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.233
You have to understand.

23:20.235 --> 23:21.801
All this started
before you were born.

23:21.803 --> 23:22.902
All this started

23:22.904 --> 23:25.638
when you decided
to chase Worth through...

23:27.676 --> 23:29.575
Never mind.

23:29.577 --> 23:30.910
What's done is done.

23:30.912 --> 23:33.413
Consider our situation.

23:33.415 --> 23:35.715
Caleb is planning a new age

23:35.717 --> 23:37.450
of the deadliest races
in history.

23:37.452 --> 23:40.620
SCIU is intent
on genocide.

23:42.723 --> 23:44.858
What comes next

23:44.860 --> 23:47.526
if one or both
of those scenarios play out?

23:47.528 --> 23:49.961
You knew all along

23:49.963 --> 23:51.530
that Caleb
couldn't be trusted.

23:51.532 --> 23:54.432
Now do you see why your ego
is the least of my worries?

23:56.736 --> 24:00.005
I just...

24:00.007 --> 24:03.642
Wanted to be part of it,

24:03.644 --> 24:04.977
after all
we've been through together.

24:04.979 --> 24:07.412
Everything outlives
its purpose, Will.

24:11.970 --> 24:13.204
Now, what have you got for me?

24:16.208 --> 24:19.310
Whatever SCIU's planning next,

24:19.312 --> 24:20.611
it's going to happen tonight.

24:20.613 --> 24:23.347
They're going kill
everyone in there.

24:23.349 --> 24:25.149
Tesla? Henry?

24:25.151 --> 24:26.450
They aren't ready yet.

24:26.452 --> 24:27.618
They're still searching
for some bloody code

24:27.620 --> 24:29.186
to shut it all down.

24:29.188 --> 24:30.387
Okay, then let me
try on my end.

24:30.389 --> 24:31.555
If I can screw up
Addison's plan somehow--

24:31.557 --> 24:32.856
You'll just end up arrested.

24:32.858 --> 24:35.091
No, I need to
get to Caleb first.

24:35.093 --> 24:38.561
Once he's dealt with,
everyone else can be evacuated.

24:38.563 --> 24:39.563
Can you handle that?

24:39.565 --> 24:42.332
Magnus, taking on Caleb alone--

24:42.334 --> 24:45.569
If you want to help,
please...

24:45.571 --> 24:47.905
Just do as I ask one final time.

24:56.650 --> 24:58.183
I got your back.

25:02.021 --> 25:05.591
I'll see you
when all this is over, Will.

25:05.593 --> 25:07.593
I promise.

25:25.979 --> 25:28.948
Only one surface-brother
knew about this.

25:28.950 --> 25:32.051
Find him!

25:46.700 --> 25:48.301
Hey, big guy.

25:48.303 --> 25:49.836
That problem
we talked about?

25:49.838 --> 25:50.703
It's happening.

25:50.705 --> 25:51.571
How many of them?

25:51.573 --> 25:52.706
Enough.

25:52.708 --> 25:53.507
If you want
to stay, fine,

25:53.509 --> 25:54.808
but I'm with you.

25:54.810 --> 25:57.110
No arguments, you hear me?

25:57.112 --> 25:58.378
I hear you.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.147
We need to get up high,
see them coming.

26:00.149 --> 26:02.316
Through here.

26:03.552 --> 26:05.319
Rooftop access?

26:05.321 --> 26:06.521
Yeah.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.623
All right.

26:10.826 --> 26:11.659
Hey!

26:11.661 --> 26:12.594
Hey!

26:12.596 --> 26:13.962
Hey!

26:13.964 --> 26:15.964
Don't do this!

26:17.467 --> 26:18.333
Sorry, Kate.

26:18.335 --> 26:19.634
Biggie!

26:19.636 --> 26:22.069
You're safer in there.

26:22.071 --> 26:23.437
This is my fight.

26:37.584 --> 26:39.418
I greeted you like a brother,

26:39.420 --> 26:41.387
and this is the thanks I get?

26:44.057 --> 26:45.691
You're not my brother.

26:49.297 --> 26:50.162
Take him.

26:55.435 --> 26:56.502
No!

27:22.597 --> 27:24.164
No!

27:29.423 --> 27:30.382
Team six,

27:30.383 --> 27:33.483
night vision scans showing
any movement in your sector?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.552
Zimmerman, just in time
for the show.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.819
Whatever you're planning
is a mistake.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.654
That is entirely up to them.

27:38.656 --> 27:41.223
Now, we delivered an ultimatum
to Caleb an hour ago.

27:41.225 --> 27:42.691
He either surrenders himself,

27:42.693 --> 27:43.959
or we come in there
and we take him down--

27:43.961 --> 27:46.562
We both know
he's not going to go for that.

27:46.564 --> 27:48.598
If you send men in there,
more people are going to die,

27:48.600 --> 27:49.866
and then after
the bloodbath,

27:49.868 --> 27:51.167
there's only
one move left,

27:51.169 --> 27:52.836
to kill everybody else
with your rabbit-proof fence.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.970
We don't know that
for sure--

27:53.972 --> 27:54.838
Come on, Addison!
You're being used here--

27:57.942 --> 27:59.676
What choice do I have?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.844
It's out of my hands,

28:00.846 --> 28:03.848
and you brought me
nothing.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.649
Give me the security codes

28:05.651 --> 28:07.618
for the fence
around the Homeland.

28:07.620 --> 28:08.785
I can buy us time.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.020
You're insane.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.756
You have
a choice,

28:12.758 --> 28:14.157
right now.

28:16.094 --> 28:17.794
It's not going to last long.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.601
Yeah, yeah, I got 'em, Will,
but we need more time.

28:25.603 --> 28:27.269
We still need to find
the right algorithm

28:27.271 --> 28:29.572
so the whole thing doesn't
blow up in everyone's face.

28:29.574 --> 28:31.941
Who is that? William?

28:31.943 --> 28:33.676
Hey, listen here,
you little creep,

28:33.678 --> 28:37.147
we're working as fast as
inhumanly possible, so--

28:37.149 --> 28:39.750
what?

28:39.752 --> 28:40.751
Yeah.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.620
Yeah, we could do that.

28:42.622 --> 28:45.323
Cut the power
to the entire Fifth Ward.

28:45.325 --> 28:46.958
I'll implement the kill codes
for the death fence.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.327
I can do that.

28:48.329 --> 28:50.295
Hey, yeah,
cutting power in five.

28:50.297 --> 28:51.663
That should give you
about 15 minutes

28:51.665 --> 28:53.198
before they switch
to a back-up grid.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.299
You good?

28:55.970 --> 28:58.070
Write a future-tech symphony
in five minutes?

28:58.072 --> 28:59.638
No problem.

29:55.131 --> 29:56.230
<i>Henry, talk to me.</i>

29:56.232 --> 29:57.965
Like, 20 seconds,
dude, stand by.

29:57.967 --> 29:59.300
Hey.

29:59.302 --> 30:00.768
Nothing from Kate
or the big guy.

30:00.770 --> 30:03.338
No communication on cell
or secure channel.

30:03.340 --> 30:04.806
What about
the energy field?

30:04.808 --> 30:06.074
Good to go.

30:06.076 --> 30:08.344
Okay, Will,
power going down...

30:08.346 --> 30:09.077
<i>Now.</i>

30:10.646 --> 30:11.680
<i>Listen, I may have bought you</i>
<i>about 10 minutes,</i>

30:11.682 --> 30:12.647
<i>less if SCIU is on the ball.</i>

30:12.649 --> 30:13.881
I'll take it.

30:13.883 --> 30:14.915
<i>I'm going to go in.</i>

30:14.917 --> 30:15.750
Will, I'm on my way.

30:15.752 --> 30:17.118
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

30:17.120 --> 30:18.552
Nice work, both of you.

30:18.554 --> 30:20.353
Hang on.

30:20.355 --> 30:21.822
Someone's at the front gate.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.727
Let's get these vehicles
out of here.

30:27.729 --> 30:29.829
All right, guys,
we're going in.

30:50.019 --> 30:50.986
Oh, God...

30:50.988 --> 30:52.754
No.

30:52.756 --> 30:54.222
No...

31:01.831 --> 31:03.766
Mind if we drop by?

31:05.836 --> 31:07.937
By all means.

31:07.939 --> 31:09.272
Welcome to my home.

31:30.764 --> 31:33.399
Henry, Nikola!
We have guests!

31:44.744 --> 31:46.512
Going into lockdown mode.

31:46.514 --> 31:48.247
I'm going to seal them off
on the main level.

31:48.249 --> 31:49.582
No, seal off the armory only.

31:49.584 --> 31:51.783
We need to bring them
into the Sanctuary proper.

31:51.785 --> 31:52.884
Say what, then?

31:52.886 --> 31:54.052
We fight them
in close quarters.

31:54.054 --> 31:55.453
<i>Lure them into to the main lab.</i>

31:55.455 --> 31:57.355
Of all the very bad ideas--

31:57.357 --> 31:58.423
Just do it!

32:01.861 --> 32:03.929
What, not going
au naturale?

32:03.931 --> 32:05.697
You disappoint me, Henry.

32:05.699 --> 32:06.832
I'm going to start
conventional.

32:06.834 --> 32:08.033
I'll go hap if I need to.

32:08.035 --> 32:09.001
What about you, t-dog,

32:09.003 --> 32:10.669
anything you need?

32:10.671 --> 32:12.004
Just a target.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.942
Shall we?

32:26.652 --> 32:29.087
It's okay.
We're here to help you.

32:29.089 --> 32:31.356
Put your weapons away.

32:31.358 --> 32:33.458
Everyone please
listen to me.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.960
You're all in grave danger.

32:34.962 --> 32:37.629
We've got to move you
out of here right now.

32:37.631 --> 32:38.697
There are people

32:38.699 --> 32:39.731
who are going to
come in here shooting

32:39.733 --> 32:41.366
very soon.

32:41.368 --> 32:43.468
If you want to live,
come with us.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.113
It's all right.

32:54.115 --> 32:55.714
Don't be afraid.

32:55.716 --> 32:57.749
Come on.
As quick as you can.

33:03.355 --> 33:05.122
As quick as you can.

33:24.843 --> 33:25.976
Get us out of here!

33:28.380 --> 33:30.414
Caleb's on the move!

33:30.416 --> 33:31.816
Copy that.
Shunting access,

33:31.818 --> 33:33.051
trying to drawn them
into the main lab.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.753
<i>Good. I'll meet you there.</i>

33:34.755 --> 33:35.854
<i>One stop to make.</i>

33:35.856 --> 33:36.888
Welcome.

34:05.917 --> 34:07.117
Well done, Henry.

34:42.853 --> 34:45.022
Somebody?

34:46.792 --> 34:47.690
Someone help!

34:55.532 --> 34:57.233
I thought he was with you.

35:07.179 --> 35:08.179
Helen.

35:08.181 --> 35:09.547
I'm fine.

35:09.549 --> 35:10.715
Are they coming?

35:10.717 --> 35:11.750
So, I notice all
the residents are gone.

35:11.752 --> 35:13.118
Caleb! Is he close?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.086
He's on his way.
He's not alone.

35:14.088 --> 35:15.020
Where's Henry?

35:15.022 --> 35:16.689
He's securing the last sector.

35:18.525 --> 35:21.126
Go.

35:23.029 --> 35:23.895
Go.

35:23.897 --> 35:25.130
Quickly.

35:47.753 --> 35:50.287
You seem mentally unstable.

35:50.289 --> 35:51.889
Facing us alone?

35:51.891 --> 35:53.758
I'm a chronic micro-manager.

36:06.672 --> 36:08.606
Yes, sir,
strike teams are ready.

36:08.608 --> 36:10.174
No, sir, no delays,

36:10.176 --> 36:12.910
just some last-minute
target adjustments.

36:13.979 --> 36:16.080
Zimmerman, you're out of time.

36:16.082 --> 36:17.314
<i>We're moving out.</i>

36:17.316 --> 36:19.016
<i>Two minutes.</i>

36:19.018 --> 36:20.050
<i>Kate, head</i>
<i>to the Sanctuary,</i>

36:20.052 --> 36:21.652
<i>south loading bay.</i>

36:21.654 --> 36:23.988
It's a shame, Helen.

36:23.990 --> 36:25.190
We could've been friends,

36:25.192 --> 36:26.992
standing shoulder
to shoulder

36:26.994 --> 36:28.060
watching the dawn
of the new age.

36:28.062 --> 36:29.128
It's too bad.

36:29.130 --> 36:31.197
You're going to miss
all the fun.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.800
So will you.

36:35.870 --> 36:36.703
Make it stop!

36:38.706 --> 36:40.774
My house. My rules.

37:15.810 --> 37:17.077
Bloody hell.

37:57.053 --> 37:59.154
Oh, my God.

38:22.679 --> 38:25.414
Hell of an exit.

38:45.870 --> 38:49.474
We've got to get
these people off the street.

38:49.476 --> 38:50.842
Find a safe house.

38:54.213 --> 38:55.947
On it.

39:12.497 --> 39:15.031
I'm sure Magnus--

39:15.033 --> 39:18.201
No.

39:19.904 --> 39:22.172
No, she's not.

41:09.117 --> 41:10.017
No secrets.

41:10.019 --> 41:15.089
I broke our deal, didn't I?

41:16.991 --> 41:18.525
Several times.

41:18.527 --> 41:20.861
Can you ever forgive me?

41:22.497 --> 41:24.998
I wish it were that easy.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.102
What if I offered you
the chance

41:29.104 --> 41:30.871
to explore a world
that you've been trying to see

41:30.873 --> 41:31.972
since you were a child?

41:35.376 --> 41:37.410
Oh, right,
you already have a job.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.479
Had a job.

41:39.481 --> 41:41.347
I quit SCIU last week.

41:42.483 --> 41:44.650
Well, then,

41:44.652 --> 41:46.518
you might want to see this.

41:46.520 --> 41:51.256
[♪]

42:01.034 --> 42:03.134
Magnus...

42:03.136 --> 42:06.671
Do you like it?

42:09.108 --> 42:11.109
I get a raise, right?

42:11.111 --> 42:13.245
Absolutely not.

42:21.688 --> 42:24.089
Shall we begin?

42:24.091 --> 42:26.424
[♪]
