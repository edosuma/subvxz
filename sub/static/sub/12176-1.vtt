WEBVTT

01:30.667 --> 01:33.477
'Where are you, Chandraettan?'

04:12.067 --> 04:16.482
Mesmerizing all of us
with her memorable performance...

04:16.533 --> 04:20.003
...Miss Vyjayanthi Ramanathan
is today, conferred with a memento

04:20.067 --> 04:22.411
...by the Kerala Music and Dance Academy

04:22.467 --> 04:24.777
Hello?
Where are you Chandra'etta?

04:25.133 --> 04:28.444
I am at a function
I'll call you back, okay?

04:28.500 --> 04:29.308
Okay
MBRHDRG

04:29.400 --> 04:35.043
I welcome popular columnist
Chandramohan Mattannur

04:44.267 --> 04:45.109
What?

04:45.200 --> 04:46.611
Sir Rumilla
(Rum not available)

04:46.667 --> 04:47.645
Who's Ram la?

04:47.700 --> 04:50.180
I mean Rum's not available
Shall I buy brandy?

04:50.233 --> 04:51.143
Hey! Don't push

04:51.200 --> 04:52.508
Buy whatever junk you get, dude!

04:52.600 --> 04:54.637
Why junk?
Don't you like savory tidbits?

04:57.533 --> 05:00.707
Ms Vyjayanthi Ramanathan
Please accept our memento

05:10.200 --> 05:11.770
I think it's over

05:12.067 --> 05:14.013
Look, this is
my new girlfriend

05:15.467 --> 05:17.174
Where is her head?

05:17.233 --> 05:18.439
She's a Mexican

05:18.500 --> 05:20.480
Don't Mexicans have heads?

05:21.367 --> 05:22.345
Hello!

05:22.500 --> 05:23.535
Hi!

05:23.700 --> 05:25.304
Okay, see you

05:25.567 --> 05:27.444
Greetings, I'll see you later

05:27.500 --> 05:28.342
Hey Chandra!

05:28.433 --> 05:30.538
Shekhar'eta!
What a surprise

05:31.667 --> 05:33.010
Where did you land from?

05:33.067 --> 05:33.636
Portugal

05:33.700 --> 05:36.237
Spent last week with
my wife and kids at Dubai

05:36.300 --> 05:37.711
From there straight on, here I am

05:37.767 --> 05:40.213
Let's hear the rest in the car

05:40.400 --> 05:42.346
Yes, let's not waste time

05:42.467 --> 05:44.504
I called you as soon as
I got off the flight

05:44.600 --> 05:45.772
Your phone was
switched off

05:46.033 --> 05:47.637
I contacted Thirumeni

05:48.100 --> 05:50.512
I then came to know
you were busy 'dancing'

05:50.567 --> 05:53.480
I have stalled
our librarian at the bar

05:53.567 --> 05:55.706
Oh! That's why he kept calling me

05:55.767 --> 05:57.713
How is Vyjayanthi?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.211
Great performance

06:00.300 --> 06:03.713
I wasn't talking of her dance
How does she 'perform'?

06:05.333 --> 06:09.645
Look at all that grey and
still going after performances, eh?

06:14.533 --> 06:17.514
- Don't talk
- Must be the wife

06:18.333 --> 06:20.279
- Sushu?
- Chandra'etta, where are you?

06:20.333 --> 06:23.712
- I am in the town
- ls the function over?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.639
Just now

06:25.700 --> 06:27.270
What was the function?

06:27.667 --> 06:30.477
Bharathanatyam dance
Sheer waste of time

06:30.567 --> 06:31.705
Who was it today?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.473
One Ms Vyjayanthi?

06:34.733 --> 06:35.973
Is she young?

06:36.067 --> 06:38.104
Hey! Not at all
A matronly lady

06:38.533 --> 06:40.535
Now you must be
on your way to booze

06:40.600 --> 06:42.443
Not at all
Where is Achu?

06:42.533 --> 06:44.240
He's studying

06:44.300 --> 06:46.678
What?!
That's amazing

06:48.467 --> 06:49.969
Who's with you?

06:50.567 --> 06:51.637
No one

06:51.700 --> 06:55.477
Just casual passers by
walking on the road

06:55.533 --> 06:57.513
- Okay
- See you

06:58.700 --> 07:00.270
Goodness!

07:00.533 --> 07:03.036
If she ever knows
you guys are with me

07:03.100 --> 07:07.276
She won't let me in peace today
saying I will booze myself senseless

07:07.333 --> 07:08.573
What a thoughtful wife

07:08.700 --> 07:10.771
Probably a case of
an overdose of love

07:11.033 --> 07:12.512
Hey! Allow me to exist somehow!

07:13.267 --> 07:15.042
What a big crowd

07:15.100 --> 07:17.341
Not even our festivals
would have so many people

07:17.433 --> 07:19.379
Your son was there too

07:19.467 --> 07:20.775
But he's just a kid

07:21.000 --> 07:23.037
But he's a 'whizz' kid in this

07:23.133 --> 07:26.080
He won't say a word whatever he does

07:26.133 --> 07:27.612
He goes shaky kneed
in front of him

07:27.700 --> 07:29.475
And respects him a lot

07:29.567 --> 07:31.774
I'm not saying this
just because he's his son

07:32.000 --> 07:34.776
Whenever there is an issue
he comes and <i>says</i> very lovingly

07:35.000 --> 07:38.038
Dad please spare me a moment

07:38.133 --> 07:39.009
Immediately he will go

07:39.067 --> 07:41.377
He'll right away bend him over
and begin punching him

07:41.467 --> 07:42.411
Isn't that rig ht?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.070
Not exactly

07:44.200 --> 07:46.476
When we carried our kids
when they were little...

07:46.533 --> 07:49.605
...don't they punch us
in the face and body?

07:49.667 --> 07:51.374
Do we ever hit them back?

07:51.433 --> 07:53.743
My son does the same
even after he's grown

07:54.000 --> 07:56.344
He doesn't seem to have
forgotten his old habits

07:56.400 --> 08:00.246
- Old habits die hard
-I think he'll be the death of me

08:01.033 --> 08:02.774
lam quite fed up
with this woman!

08:04.000 --> 08:04.774
One minute

08:05.167 --> 08:06.612
Hello Sushu?

08:07.567 --> 08:09.012
Where are you, Chandra'etta?

08:09.100 --> 08:11.307
I am...er...um...at home

08:11.367 --> 08:13.973
- Have you eaten?
-About to eat

08:14.033 --> 08:17.071
It's already ten
What's for dinner?

08:17.200 --> 08:21.239
Dinner...Dosa...2 of them
(pancakes)

08:21.300 --> 08:23.576
Don't you hear
the batter being spread?

08:23.633 --> 08:26.239
Sounds just like
a soda bottle being opened

08:27.067 --> 08:28.774
I know what's going on there

08:29.033 --> 08:32.378
Isn't that why you got yourself
a job the legislative assembly

08:32.500 --> 08:35.413
Not at all bothered
about my transfer now

08:35.467 --> 08:39.107
To booze and enjoy all alone
Isn't that the truth?

08:39.167 --> 08:41.147
An overdose of love
makes one mad

08:41.232 --> 08:42.337
You haven't seen everything

08:42.400 --> 08:47.145
She wakes him every morning
like the hymns from a temple

08:47.233 --> 08:51.181
And every night sings
a lullaby till he sleeps

08:51.233 --> 08:52.268
Aren't I rig ht?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.673
Seeing his plight, I am
shit scared of getting married

08:57.467 --> 09:00.243
My dear, how can you
think such things of me?

09:00.300 --> 09:01.472
How else must I think?

09:01.533 --> 09:03.638
Stop complaining...hello?

09:05.500 --> 09:08.344
Got disconnected
Better leave it switched off

09:08.433 --> 09:10.470
Let me have peace
for sometime at least

09:10.700 --> 09:12.475
Goodness! I'll be left
with only soda to drink

09:12.567 --> 09:14.410
- Is it over Chandra?
- For the time being

09:14.500 --> 09:15.979
Come on then, pour

09:16.300 --> 09:19.281
Careful! Don't break them
This is not the assembly premises

09:22.333 --> 09:25.246
I don't know why, but
a single peg knocks me off these days

09:25.300 --> 09:25.971
Really?

09:26.067 --> 09:30.174
I just can't figure out
if I am on the 8th or 9th round

09:30.500 --> 09:32.537
Then why don't you stop with 7

09:32.733 --> 09:34.713
Because I am unable to keep count

09:35.767 --> 09:37.508
If the police catch us
you better blow your breath

09:37.567 --> 09:39.513
Sure, so that they can stuff that
machine down my throat

09:39.567 --> 09:41.547
Sir, 'veedethi' we are home
(also means house is on fire)

09:41.600 --> 09:43.273
Then douse it with water dude!

09:43.633 --> 09:44.634
Sir...Good night!

09:44.700 --> 09:46.702
Get lost man!
How many times to remind you

09:46.767 --> 09:48.508
To buy me a Good night
Mosquito Repellent

09:48.567 --> 09:51.104
Mosquitoes have
a field day feeding on me

09:51.167 --> 09:54.740
Wonder where people slept
before the cot was invented

10:03.500 --> 10:06.413
Is this the time to play
morning prayer songs?

10:07.667 --> 10:09.578
Hello?
Who is it?

10:11.233 --> 10:12.610
It keeps ringing

10:20.600 --> 10:23.240
- Are you asleep?
-You want me to wake up?

10:23.300 --> 10:24.677
Why was your
mobile switched off?

10:24.767 --> 10:26.769
I didn't
It switched off by itself

10:27.000 --> 10:29.981
What a pity!
Do you know how many times I called?

10:30.067 --> 10:32.047
How can I re-charge
without coming home?

10:32.133 --> 10:33.771
But didn't you say
you were at home?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.706
God! Now I'm in a mess

10:35.767 --> 10:39.044
Always lying
Why are you doing this?

10:39.133 --> 10:41.204
- Sushu please...!
-What now?

10:41.300 --> 10:44.406
If you have even an ounce of love
allow me to get some sleep

10:44.467 --> 10:46.674
- Will you lie to me again?
-No

10:47.267 --> 10:48.177
Then go sleep

10:48.233 --> 10:49.678
You also must go sleep

10:49.733 --> 10:50.473
okay

10:50.533 --> 10:51.739
Good night

10:52.667 --> 10:54.112
Did that hurt?

10:58.033 --> 10:59.512
Now lie close to me

10:59.600 --> 11:01.045
Don't put your leg over me, okay?

11:01.133 --> 11:02.476
Don't call me again, okay?

11:31.267 --> 11:34.180
Good morning
Aren't you jogging today?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.578
I am jogging right now

11:37.700 --> 11:40.442
Stop playing the fool
Get up

11:40.633 --> 11:43.204
I'm very tired

11:43.433 --> 11:48.109
Nothing doing!
Why did you booze last night?

11:48.200 --> 11:52.410
Your cholesterol is 240
You must walk at least 4KM

11:52.467 --> 11:53.241
Now get UP

11:53.300 --> 11:55.507
Ask the cholesterol to take a walk

11:55.600 --> 12:00.310
Getting up early morning...!
Okay, I am up

12:04.733 --> 12:07.680
I feel like running off
when I think ofjogging

12:11.067 --> 12:12.273
What the heck is his name?

12:12.367 --> 12:14.540
Ah! Sumesh
Do I get some tea?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.107
There was milk enough
forjust one tea

12:17.167 --> 12:19.238
So I had it
Can I get you a cup tomorrow?

12:20.067 --> 12:23.105
Calls himself my slave!
But lazy to the core

12:27.267 --> 12:30.441
Looks like he'll topple it down now
Girls are lesser than usual today

12:30.533 --> 12:34.777
<i>This grandpa is so jobless
That's all for today</i> I <i>guess</i>

12:35.467 --> 12:37.378
Feeding the doves
Exercise for the fingers

12:37.433 --> 12:38.503
What a variety of strange people

12:38.600 --> 12:41.046
- You are in no way lesser
- What's wrong with me?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.078
There she comes

12:42.200 --> 12:44.703
If you misbehave, I won't
come this way again, okay?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.570
Hey! Come here

12:47.700 --> 12:49.145
<i>Drawer'.!</i>

13:04.800 --> 13:07.337
- Where are you?
- I'm walking

13:07.467 --> 13:09.970
Do you remember
what day it is today?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.144
What?

13:11.233 --> 13:12.507
Don't you remember?

13:12.633 --> 13:13.509
No

13:14.233 --> 13:17.771
Today was the day
you first came to see me

13:18.000 --> 13:19.035
Now do you remember?

13:19.100 --> 13:20.135
Today...Hiroshima day

13:20.233 --> 13:21.405
August 6th

13:21.467 --> 13:25.381
One of the most horrendous
episode in history that stunned...

13:25.467 --> 13:27.071
...the conscience of the world

13:27.133 --> 13:31.172
America's cruel act that turned
Japan into a handful of ashes

13:31.467 --> 13:37.418
Millions died after 2 nuclear bombs
were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

13:38.233 --> 13:43.342
Even after 7 decades
Japan has not recovered

13:43.500 --> 13:49.644
Let each one of us pray
that such an event never occurs again

13:51.700 --> 13:56.706
The lady's horoscope
indicates a discordance

13:57.100 --> 14:00.047
Even if your husband
is in the fire force...

14:00.100 --> 14:02.671
...there still would be
a delay in birth of a child

14:02.767 --> 14:06.442
To overcome this, you must
undergo a penance on Sundays

14:06.500 --> 14:08.309
...and chant the hymns of the sun

14:08.400 --> 14:12.075
On Mondays and Tuesdays,
maintain the same penance...

14:12.167 --> 14:15.239
...fasting and prayers must be
offered to goddesses Durga and Kali

14:15.300 --> 14:18.372
On Wednesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays, follow...

14:18.433 --> 14:25.715
...the same rigorous oath and
visit temples with needful rituals

14:25.800 --> 14:28.781
Only then you will be
blessed with a son

14:29.600 --> 14:31.307
What the heck is he saying?

14:31.467 --> 14:34.346
How can children be born
after being celibate 7 days a week?

14:34.400 --> 14:35.572
Is Achu awake?

14:36.567 --> 14:37.602
He is

14:37.667 --> 14:38.702
Where is he?

14:39.067 --> 14:40.740
He...is in the cowshed

14:52.667 --> 14:53.975
Spiderman!

14:54.800 --> 14:56.507
What are you doing my boy?

14:56.567 --> 14:59.241
She's refusing to be milked
with all the ruckus you are creating

14:59.300 --> 15:01.337
Don't you have school?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.310
Spiderman is not in school
He is in college

15:04.367 --> 15:07.348
You don't know anything
No wonder you are just a cow hand

15:08.333 --> 15:10.313
Achu, have you
brushed your teeth?

15:10.467 --> 15:11.639
The school bus
will soon be here

15:11.700 --> 15:12.644
I am on leave today

15:12.700 --> 15:14.771
Don't play truant,
I'll call up your dad

15:15.000 --> 15:17.981
If you continue, that cow
will sue you for harassment

15:18.033 --> 15:21.310
If cowhands in town
go about doing other jobs...

15:21.367 --> 15:22.437
...what else can I do?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.275
I did warn you
not to buy that cow...

15:24.333 --> 15:26.006
...believing cow hand
Monachan's words

15:26.067 --> 15:27.410
Did you even
bother to listen?

15:27.467 --> 15:29.037
Now give me
what you got

15:33.033 --> 15:35.570
Here you are

15:37.200 --> 15:38.042
Enough?

15:46.433 --> 15:48.106
Go to school my boy

15:48.400 --> 15:50.710
Don't you want to grow
into a great scientist?

15:50.767 --> 15:52.747
How can you refuse
to go to school?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.104
Give it to mom

15:54.533 --> 15:56.740
Get hertransferred here
quickly otherwise...

15:57.000 --> 15:58.741
...you'll die of radiation effects

15:58.800 --> 15:59.778
One minute

16:00.167 --> 16:03.148
Just mind your business and
iron this pair of briefs also

16:05.300 --> 16:07.371
Does he think my
business is to iron briefs?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.106
Does he have
only this one pair?

16:09.167 --> 16:12.239
It looks like a rag cloth
lam fed up with all this

16:12.467 --> 16:14.310
What's that?
Incense burning?

16:14.433 --> 16:15.741
You asked me
to iron it, didn't you?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.370
I did not ask you to burn it

16:17.433 --> 16:18.343
Move!

16:21.133 --> 16:23.511
Goodness! An egg can easily
turn to omelet in this heat

16:23.600 --> 16:25.238
God! What a disaster

16:25.367 --> 16:27.278
Shall we leave it in the fridge?

16:28.533 --> 16:31.173
If you have clothes to be washed
put them in this

16:48.033 --> 16:50.536
I have reached office
What about you?

16:50.633 --> 16:52.135
I too just reached

16:52.200 --> 16:53.975
I'll sign and call you

16:56.100 --> 16:59.013
Signature is going
to be a tug of war

16:59.300 --> 17:01.177
What is your complaint?

17:01.233 --> 17:03.213
It is regarding you

17:03.333 --> 17:06.439
A complaint regarding
widow's pension claimed by my wife...

17:06.500 --> 17:09.037
...has not been
looked into since last 5 years

17:09.099 --> 17:10.772
Your wife's widow pension?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.172
But you are not dead yet

17:12.267 --> 17:13.769
But her husband is dead

17:14.000 --> 17:14.978
What about you?

17:15.032 --> 17:17.569
I am her husband
But not on paper

17:17.633 --> 17:19.010
Living together

17:20.200 --> 17:21.338
Living together

17:21.400 --> 17:23.436
Living together?
He is the rig ht age for that

17:24.400 --> 17:25.310
Peon?!

17:26.000 --> 17:27.775
This is meant for that

17:28.700 --> 17:31.510
Ask Premalatha to check
his wife's pension file

17:31.600 --> 17:32.704
Go with him

17:33.100 --> 17:34.738
Go quickly before
something happens to you

17:34.800 --> 17:35.574
okay

17:38.167 --> 17:40.078
Hey! Sir please don't try to be funny

17:40.167 --> 17:43.046
You can sign at the Academy
for Dance and Music

17:43.100 --> 17:47.446
Do you realize how many days
you've walked off without leave?

17:47.500 --> 17:51.471
- Look...1...2...3
- 3

17:51.567 --> 17:54.446
- It's 7 days
- But I was away for only a week!

17:54.533 --> 17:59.175
The petition against
the lady doctor is pending...

17:59.267 --> 18:03.716
...for which the chairman
has been calling since 2 weeks

18:04.100 --> 18:07.081
And you go watch dances

18:07.200 --> 18:09.476
While I listen to them rant and rave

18:09.767 --> 18:14.045
Sir, from today
I won't budge from my seat

18:14.633 --> 18:16.237
Why take so much trouble?

18:16.333 --> 18:20.008
If that file is not on my table
tomorrow morning...

18:20.067 --> 18:22.775
...I'll make you dance
Otamthullal (men's dance form)

18:23.000 --> 18:24.741
Why not Thiruvathira?
(women's dance)

18:24.800 --> 18:26.575
Remani will also be there

18:26.700 --> 18:30.273
Don't take advantage
of my partiality to the fine arts

18:30.333 --> 18:33.542
I swear I will not
Upon your these hairs

18:33.633 --> 18:35.044
- Take your hand off
- No need

18:35.100 --> 18:36.636
Shall I sign?

18:39.267 --> 18:42.646
Goodness! 7 empty blocks
Shall I sign in all?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.680
Why do you...ask me?

18:44.767 --> 18:47.407
Hey! Don't sulk
double headed snake

18:47.467 --> 18:49.572
I am touched
by this affection

18:50.267 --> 18:51.473
Don't sign for all of them

18:51.567 --> 18:53.342
Okay
Only in mine

18:53.633 --> 18:56.512
You can always sign for me
It's quite easy to copy, actually

18:56.567 --> 18:57.443
Next month...?

18:57.500 --> 19:00.140
The pen...belongs here
leave it there

19:00.300 --> 19:03.110
Next month you must adjust a bit
Just 5 days

19:03.200 --> 19:04.645
Not possible

19:05.067 --> 19:07.741
You can't say that
It's quiet urgent

19:07.800 --> 19:09.074
What's the urgency?

19:09.433 --> 19:12.107
It's a family tour
I can't go home otherwise

19:12.200 --> 19:15.340
Well, if you go touring
you won't get in here also

19:15.467 --> 19:19.381
You don't know me
Push me and I get real nasty

19:19.467 --> 19:21.242
Actually, you're vile
even without the push

19:21.333 --> 19:23.279
Go get that lady doctor...!

19:23.567 --> 19:24.568
The file

19:25.400 --> 19:26.401
Hey you!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.705
Do you want me
to bring your bag to your table?

19:28.767 --> 19:29.438
No

19:29.500 --> 19:32.447
Since there is nothing else to be done...

19:32.633 --> 19:33.771
...Premalatha?

19:34.733 --> 19:36.041
Not you

19:36.200 --> 19:37.440
Get going
Quick

19:39.733 --> 19:42.373
We have a committee meeting
this afternoon

19:42.467 --> 19:43.605
Don't disappear

19:44.500 --> 19:45.638
Sir?

19:45.767 --> 19:47.576
Regarding your
wife's transfer, rig ht?

19:47.667 --> 19:48.304
Yes sir

19:48.367 --> 19:49.710
I have spoken to the Minister

19:49.767 --> 19:53.647
lfl do it directly, other
associations will create problems

19:53.700 --> 19:56.237
- We'll get it for you
- Thank you sir

19:56.367 --> 19:58.643
Only a thank you eh?
Better go

20:07.100 --> 20:08.670
Sir?
Temple offerings

20:11.333 --> 20:13.006
Valtsala, you haven't paid yet

20:13.067 --> 20:14.546
lam coming only
if it is to Tanjavur

20:14.600 --> 20:17.410
But this is not a pilgrimage
Just a tour

20:18.133 --> 20:21.137
You go ahead
to Ooty or Kodaikanal

20:21.200 --> 20:22.611
I only said
I wasn't coming

20:22.667 --> 20:25.443
Sir, this is from the temple

20:25.700 --> 20:28.442
- When did you return?
-Yesterday

20:28.533 --> 20:32.413
- When did you go?
- On 13th

20:32.633 --> 20:35.409
So it's been one week
No thanks

20:36.400 --> 20:42.214
Last time you gave me, I couldn't
leave the toilet for a week

20:42.567 --> 20:44.240
I have no more leave left

20:44.533 --> 20:46.035
Who does he think he is?!

20:46.133 --> 20:47.134
Take it, dear

20:58.767 --> 21:01.714
Chandre'ttans article
has come in Mathrubhumi

21:02.000 --> 21:04.071
Does he write
only about women?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.779
No wonder your transfer
remains pending

21:13.733 --> 21:15.576
Mom, where are
we going for our tour?

21:15.633 --> 21:18.239
- First to Cherpulaserry
- Cherpulaserry?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.507
- Don't you want to meet grandma?
- Sure I do

21:20.600 --> 21:25.174
By the time we reach Palakkad
the office staff bus will also reach there

21:25.267 --> 21:26.541
We'll go in the bus from there

21:26.633 --> 21:27.475
Where to?

21:27.533 --> 21:31.606
Ooty, Kodai and
if possible to Mysore

21:32.567 --> 21:34.444
Will I find
Spiderman in Ooty?

21:35.367 --> 21:38.041
Of course not
But dad will be there

21:45.067 --> 21:46.603
Where is he barging into?

21:48.167 --> 21:49.771
What the heck did you do?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.236
Is that you sir?

21:52.300 --> 21:53.779
Can't you figure out?

21:54.733 --> 21:56.440
What the heck is all this?

21:56.567 --> 21:59.514
Didn't I tell you I wanted
to go home tomorrow?

21:59.567 --> 22:02.377
My wife and kid are
anxiously waiting for me

22:02.500 --> 22:05.777
Why did you put me in this
Medical College Commission?

22:06.033 --> 22:07.478
Isn't there
anyone else to go in my place?

22:07.533 --> 22:09.137
Hey! Have you gone
down the closet drain?

22:09.267 --> 22:10.541
Want to join me?

22:10.700 --> 22:12.236
You...don't...!

22:13.600 --> 22:16.672
Dude, how can I go against
the Chairman's orders?

22:16.767 --> 22:20.340
Didn't you also see
the commotion in Thailand...

22:20.433 --> 22:23.004
...when chikungunya
spread in Trivandrum?

22:24.700 --> 22:27.977
My wife has not yet got over
the disappointment of last time

22:28.033 --> 22:29.239
Now it's happened again

22:29.300 --> 22:32.213
Don't they also deserve
somejoy and peace in life?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.038
There is only one person
responsible for all this

22:36.267 --> 22:38.076
Aedes albopictus

22:39.000 --> 22:39.774
Who is he?

22:40.033 --> 22:42.479
The mosquito that
spreads chikungunya

22:47.400 --> 22:50.438
Achu! It's dad's job
that's keeping him away

22:50.533 --> 22:53.537
What big speeches you gave
Ooty, Kodai, Cherpulaserry

22:53.600 --> 22:54.544
Don't sulk

22:54.600 --> 22:56.375
Don't talk to me

22:56.800 --> 22:59.212
Dad does this always
Promises but never comes

22:59.300 --> 23:01.712
- Uncle?
-I'm right here my boy!

23:10.533 --> 23:12.410
- Sushma
-Hi Sister

23:13.100 --> 23:15.239
Chandran did it again, eh?

23:15.433 --> 23:18.073
It was not him
It was Chikungunya

23:20.600 --> 23:23.706
What is it Achu?
Mom, dad's come!

23:23.767 --> 23:25.178
I'll be right there

23:25.500 --> 23:28.640
- He's come
- I'll pray and come

23:37.467 --> 23:40.380
Spiderman's mom has come

23:41.367 --> 23:42.675
Today I am spiderman

23:42.733 --> 23:43.507
Mom

23:43.567 --> 23:45.012
Careful

23:52.033 --> 23:53.603
Hey! Stand there

23:56.200 --> 23:59.306
Forgive me dear
It was not deliberate

23:59.433 --> 24:01.310
What can I do if my leave
is not sanctioned?

24:01.367 --> 24:04.177
You have time to
meet and write about...

24:04.233 --> 24:08.272
...the dancers all over
the world and also get leave

24:08.500 --> 24:14.974
But the minute I want something
it is chikungunya, assembly meeting etc

24:15.167 --> 24:18.011
Forget it
I'll go on living here all alone

24:18.767 --> 24:21.077
Don't be like this

24:22.000 --> 24:23.673
We are going for the tour

24:24.167 --> 24:26.306
But didn't they all
leave yesterday?

24:26.400 --> 24:29.074
Let them go
We'll go separately

24:30.400 --> 24:31.970
Don't fool me

24:32.067 --> 24:33.569
Really! We'll go

24:33.633 --> 24:34.441
Surely?

24:35.367 --> 24:36.402
Surely

24:36.633 --> 24:37.668
Where to?

24:38.167 --> 24:39.441
Where ever you want to

24:39.533 --> 24:40.568
Come close to me

24:41.467 --> 24:43.208
Where is that song from?

24:43.467 --> 24:44.741
Go and look

24:45.233 --> 24:47.440
From when did brother-in-law
begin music programs in the cow shed?

24:47.533 --> 24:49.103
Maybe to get more cow dung

24:49.167 --> 24:54.167
"My darling if you clasp my hand
Why would I need my eyesight"

25:01.000 --> 25:03.412
Hey! This is fantastic

25:03.600 --> 25:06.513
Music, hi-tech milking
What else?

25:07.400 --> 25:11.405
I realized only nowthe close
connection between music and cows

25:12.233 --> 25:16.340
Remember, Lord Krishna in our epics
played his flute to a herd of cows

25:16.400 --> 25:19.540
It's nowfound out that
cows yield more milk hearing music

25:19.667 --> 25:21.578
This is quite interesting

25:21.734 --> 25:24.271
She prefers Asha Bhosle

25:24.534 --> 25:26.411
But she likes Mehdi Hassan

25:26.467 --> 25:28.674
Probably some Pak breed

25:28.733 --> 25:32.510
Achu suggested a song and I played it

25:32.567 --> 25:35.605
Milk just flowed in abundance

25:36.034 --> 25:37.604
What song was that, bro?

25:37.700 --> 25:40.579
Our...Gangan style

25:41.200 --> 25:42.042
And?

25:42.100 --> 25:47.072
It lasted only for 2 days
3rd day it just reduced to one-third

25:48.100 --> 25:50.046
Things became rather nasty

25:50.100 --> 25:53.570
But I didn't give up
I just decided on Babu'kka

25:55.533 --> 25:58.571
Melody is totally trustworthy
Neither too much nor too little

25:58.633 --> 25:59.634
Always steady

26:01.000 --> 26:04.413
Now we supply the milk-society
and there's still enough left for us

26:04.467 --> 26:05.775
Isn't that more than enough?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.640
Our own singers are best for us

26:08.700 --> 26:12.045
They guarantee success
and listening is a pleasure

26:12.100 --> 26:13.101
And sufficient milk

26:13.200 --> 26:13.769
Dad?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.035
Where are you?

26:15.700 --> 26:16.678
Coming

26:16.733 --> 26:20.442
Wash the vessel from the society

26:21.100 --> 26:24.104
- We fixed the place
-Where?

26:24.167 --> 26:26.477
Chandra'etta, why not go to Tanjavur?

26:26.567 --> 26:28.444
It was Vatsala'edathi's suggestion

26:28.567 --> 26:30.638
Fine
Let it be Tanjavur

26:31.233 --> 26:33.110
Is she also coming?

26:34.433 --> 26:36.174
Let her
Poor thing

26:36.300 --> 26:38.211
Oh okay sure
Poor things

26:38.300 --> 26:41.042
Ask her to call
a few more poor things

26:41.100 --> 26:43.706
Let's then go in a lorry
like they do for protests

26:43.800 --> 26:45.541
Don't be silly Chandra'etta

26:46.900 --> 26:51.900
<i>tiff </i>

27:00.300 --> 27:07.309
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

27:07.400 --> 27:14.579
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

27:14.667 --> 27:18.274
"Come on! Leave home
and let's set sail uponjourney"

27:18.367 --> 27:22.076
"Oh dragon flies of Malayala soil
and little birds young and dear"

27:22.133 --> 27:25.478
"As the early sunrays slant
upon the divine tower of temples"

27:25.533 --> 27:29.379
"To drink in these awesome sight
Come, let's go in our chariots awhile"

27:29.434 --> 27:36.283
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

27:36.367 --> 27:43.285
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

27:43.433 --> 27:48.433
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

28:13.533 --> 28:14.739
Pilla sir called

28:14.800 --> 28:17.974
Our Shivadas sir broke
his foot while at Coimbatore

28:18.067 --> 28:19.011
<i>How?</i>

28:19.067 --> 28:23.209
No idea, but they cancelled
the trip and returned home

28:24.500 --> 28:26.070
How sad

28:26.133 --> 28:27.339
He deserves it

28:27.400 --> 28:33.442
He refused the offerings of God
I knew then he'd land up in trouble

28:33.700 --> 28:36.078
Hari Om

28:38.267 --> 28:45.378
"While the sunlight draws
geometric patterns across streets"

28:45.467 --> 28:52.612
"Clouds danced over hills of Murugamala
Like golden peacocks in full forms"

28:52.700 --> 28:59.640
"Evening rays of a gentle sun
soothing the heart like fragrant balm"

28:59.700 --> 29:03.147
"Wafting with heady fragrance
of jasmine flowers so mild"

29:03.200 --> 29:06.647
"Who are awaiting to welcome
Oh breeze of Tamil soil?"

29:06.700 --> 29:14.312
"Whispering the language of this land
Let's all dance the 'karakattam' together"

29:15.733 --> 29:22.673
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

29:22.767 --> 29:27.011
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

29:27.233 --> 29:28.143
What is all this?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.043
Have you come here
to get drunk?

29:30.100 --> 29:31.636
Didn't I tell you
this will create issues

29:31.733 --> 29:33.178
Now go sleep

29:34.534 --> 29:36.605
Stop fussing
Look there

29:38.167 --> 29:40.306
Isn't the moon pretty?

29:41.567 --> 29:43.069
Look there

29:45.767 --> 29:47.178
No!
stop

29:47.234 --> 29:48.542
Don't talk to me

29:49.200 --> 29:50.611
My hands are empty

29:50.667 --> 29:55.343
Look at the moon
So beautiful isn't it?

29:59.367 --> 30:00.675
Lovely moon

30:01.500 --> 30:05.038
If I ask you something
will you tell me the truth?

30:05.367 --> 30:08.314
Are you seeing the moon
for the very first time?

30:09.334 --> 30:10.335
Better go sleep I guess!

30:10.400 --> 30:17.079
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

30:17.333 --> 30:24.376
"Dreams like birds soar
to touch the clouds fly in abandon"

30:24.733 --> 30:29.733
<i>tiff </i>

30:46.000 --> 30:47.502
Vaithees hwarar refers
to Lord Shiva

30:47.700 --> 30:50.704
Vaitheeshwarar temple is
well known all over the world

30:50.800 --> 30:52.336
Please explain
in Malayalam sir

30:52.433 --> 30:53.207
Oh, I forget

30:53.300 --> 30:54.677
You are from Kerala, right?

30:54.733 --> 30:56.007
Yes

30:56.067 --> 31:00.573
Vaitheeshwarar temple is
known for its 'Nadi Astrology'

31:00.700 --> 31:08.744
Agasthyar, one of the 7 ancient sages
is the father of Nadi astrology

31:09.000 --> 31:13.710
The birth, life and death
of each mortal was recorded...

31:13.800 --> 31:16.508
...4000 years ago by Agasthyar

31:16.567 --> 31:18.979
- 4000 years ago?
- Yes ma'am

31:19.033 --> 31:20.569
...wrote 4,000 years ago

31:20.633 --> 31:25.582
The astrologers here predict
using these astrological writings

31:25.633 --> 31:26.976
Can we look at ours also?

31:27.067 --> 31:28.444
Of course you can
Come with me

31:28.500 --> 31:30.138
- Let's go Chandraetta
- No better work!

31:30.200 --> 31:31.270
Don't say no

31:31.334 --> 31:34.474
Anyway since we've come this far
let's see it as well

31:34.567 --> 31:36.103
Come sir

31:36.167 --> 31:37.202
Come, dear

31:40.300 --> 31:41.574
Greetings sir

31:41.667 --> 31:45.012
Your finger print please?

31:45.133 --> 31:46.237
You give yours

31:46.333 --> 31:47.471
You give it Chandra'etta

31:47.533 --> 31:49.672
You were the one
who wanted to see

31:50.300 --> 31:51.677
How is that correct?

31:51.734 --> 31:54.146
If we see yours
it's equal to seeing all of us

31:54.200 --> 31:57.238
How does that make sense
Hey! What the heck...?

31:57.467 --> 31:59.413
- What is your name?
- Chandramohan

31:59.500 --> 32:02.174
Chandeeramohan
(chandhee refers to buttocks)

32:02.333 --> 32:06.042
It's not Chandeeramohan
Chandramohan

32:06.267 --> 32:08.770
Mine may be sticking out
But do you have to write it out?

32:09.033 --> 32:09.602
Chandra'etta!

32:09.700 --> 32:13.341
He can't even say my name properly
To think he'll tell us our future

32:13.533 --> 32:15.035
All this is a hoax

32:15.100 --> 32:16.238
- Hoax?
-You bet

32:16.300 --> 32:18.246
Who do you think
predicted ourAbdullakutty...

32:18.333 --> 32:20.040
...will become member
of legislative assembly?

32:20.133 --> 32:21.476
It was them

32:22.133 --> 32:23.635
My dearSushu

32:23.700 --> 32:28.547
You mean palm leaves of
7 million people are stored here?

32:28.600 --> 32:30.341
Have no doubts at all

32:30.667 --> 32:37.084
The lifetime of a man is said
to be divided into 16 phases

32:37.333 --> 32:39.643
They will tell you
the exact day you will die

32:39.700 --> 32:41.680
Then why don't you see?

32:41.734 --> 32:43.975
Nadi and nerves!
Haven't you got better things to do?

32:44.033 --> 32:45.444
Let's have a drink
and sit somewhere

32:45.500 --> 32:47.741
Why pick on me
It's all your sister's fault

32:56.034 --> 32:58.105
Let us read your palm leaf

33:01.367 --> 33:06.749
Just answer 'yes' or 'no'
to the questions I ask

33:07.000 --> 33:08.775
You must not say
anything else

33:09.633 --> 33:10.543
No

33:11.167 --> 33:12.441
Yes

33:13.467 --> 33:17.609
Your father's name
is Raghvan

33:17.767 --> 33:18.711
No

33:22.133 --> 33:27.708
Your father's name
is Damodaran

33:28.633 --> 33:29.611
Yes!

33:32.200 --> 33:35.409
Your mother, is Savithri

33:35.633 --> 33:36.634
No

33:40.767 --> 33:46.581
Your father Damodaran
Mother is Dakshayini

33:46.800 --> 33:47.744
No

33:49.167 --> 33:52.671
This is a copy of the quiz program
on our Am ritha TV channel

33:52.767 --> 33:54.303
Yes, that's what it is

33:57.200 --> 34:01.580
Your father is Damodaran
Mother is Kausalya

34:02.733 --> 34:04.110
Yes

34:04.533 --> 34:12.315
Does your wife's name contain
letters that sound sa, ma ga, la?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.070
Yes

34:17.500 --> 34:22.074
Your wife's name is Sushma

34:23.100 --> 34:24.237
It's me

34:25.233 --> 34:26.405
Let's see the next leaf

34:26.500 --> 34:29.242
You have a son
Ashwin

34:31.500 --> 34:35.107
You live very far away
from where your wife lives

34:35.199 --> 34:39.580
You hold a Government job
You are an artist and a writer

34:39.632 --> 34:41.670
Your star sign is Andromeda

34:41.734 --> 34:46.205
Your planetary position indicate
you are in Kethu(Dragon tail planet)

34:46.434 --> 34:49.438
You will go through
plenty of disturbing thoughts in future

34:50.067 --> 34:54.641
The moon in the 7th house
is now in Meenam (Pisces)

34:55.132 --> 34:59.172
So, in spite of a beautiful wife
chances are that you'll get into...

34:59.300 --> 35:06.013
...a relationship
with another woman

35:06.800 --> 35:11.647
Agasthyar mentions it
in your past birth

35:12.800 --> 35:14.575
Let us read his past birth

35:14.633 --> 35:16.169
Come, this is enough
Let's go

35:16.267 --> 35:17.109
No!

35:17.167 --> 35:18.646
Continue with it Swamy

35:18.800 --> 35:23.800
During the reign of Raja Raja Chozhan
nearly 1000 years ago in Tanjavur...

35:30.300 --> 35:34.271
...you were a great artist and poet in his court

35:38.200 --> 35:41.773
Velkuzhukottuvan

35:51.000 --> 35:57.576
A famous dancer from Madurai
comes to Tanjavurmvasanthamallika

36:08.300 --> 36:10.439
They fell in love at first sight

36:36.567 --> 36:40.242
Just one glimpse of
her love filled eyes and...

36:40.734 --> 36:44.705
...a million poems
awoke within him

36:50.034 --> 36:54.642
But our king could not
tolerate this relationship

37:03.134 --> 37:05.011
'Wait, I'll shatter your happiness'

37:10.500 --> 37:11.740
<i>'VE L'</i>

37:22.667 --> 37:23.645
Vel

37:25.500 --> 37:29.448
That was when
neighbor king Chera Chozhan declared war

37:32.267 --> 37:37.717
Oh King! Poets wage war
not with swords but with a pen

37:38.000 --> 37:41.106
Pen?
What will you do with a pen?

37:41.167 --> 37:43.374
Poke that King Cheran
on his bums, eh?

37:43.467 --> 37:46.175
Your majesty! My pen!

37:46.700 --> 37:48.304
This is so heavy!

37:48.367 --> 37:50.176
You have been holding
a pen all these days

37:50.234 --> 37:51.713
Now go and wage wars
for some time

37:51.767 --> 37:52.677
Go man!

37:52.734 --> 37:54.008
Oh King!

37:55.500 --> 37:58.447
My words are more
powerful than this sword

37:59.334 --> 38:04.613
Of course! Don't I know that
is how you and Vasanthamallika...!

38:04.700 --> 38:06.737
Don't make me say things
Get lost from here

38:07.000 --> 38:08.638
Stop glaring
Get out!

38:08.767 --> 38:10.212
Your majesty!

38:12.034 --> 38:12.774
What's that?

38:13.034 --> 38:13.978
The armor

38:14.033 --> 38:16.639
What does he need
an armor for...take it away

38:32.767 --> 38:34.007
One minute

38:35.000 --> 38:36.479
Vasanthamallika

38:37.500 --> 38:41.710
These are not mere poems
It is my heart

38:42.367 --> 38:45.246
lam going to war
I don't know if I'll return

38:45.300 --> 38:49.180
lfl don't see you again
we shall meet in next birth

38:49.667 --> 38:50.441
Bye

38:50.500 --> 38:51.774
Enough
Get going

39:17.667 --> 39:18.668
Come

39:19.734 --> 39:20.735
Let go of me

39:23.134 --> 39:24.204
And then?

39:26.534 --> 39:31.176
The war waged on between the two armies

39:31.267 --> 39:40.244
In that battle, Velkuzhukottan
was killed under the feet of an elephant

39:42.367 --> 39:45.314
Shame dad! Were you stamped
to death by an elephant?

39:46.300 --> 39:48.405
Can we change
the way he died?

39:48.734 --> 39:49.769
Be quiet!

39:50.000 --> 39:51.707
What happened
to Vasanthamallika?

39:53.067 --> 39:58.779
Since her love went unrequited
Vasanthamallika will come in search

39:59.500 --> 40:06.110
Possible that she could try to
retrieve the love she lost last birth

40:10.334 --> 40:11.312
Nothing

40:11.367 --> 40:17.079
Note that, the moon holds
a peak position in Meenam rasi

40:18.100 --> 40:22.173
So you must be very careful

40:23.100 --> 40:27.139
Otherwise your
husband will leave you

40:29.234 --> 40:30.372
That's torn it!

40:32.600 --> 40:33.601
My God!

40:36.333 --> 40:39.439
These are not my words
Agastyar said so

40:41.534 --> 40:43.536
You will stray

40:46.200 --> 40:48.680
What's left now?!
Everything's in a mess

40:49.434 --> 40:52.415
If not, be sure the moon
will forcibly lead you astray

40:55.500 --> 40:57.343
What are you laughing?

40:57.767 --> 41:01.112
Nothing! Just the way
you died last birth

41:01.167 --> 41:02.669
Elephant stamped him to death

41:05.267 --> 41:07.372
I wish we had looked into
yours too, brother-in-law

41:07.434 --> 41:08.344
For what?

41:08.433 --> 41:11.243
Maybe your death would
have been by a buffalo

41:11.334 --> 41:12.677
Am I right Sushu?

41:13.233 --> 41:15.611
Cow hand gets killed by a buffalo

41:17.434 --> 41:19.710
I love you more now Vatsala'echi

41:19.800 --> 41:21.609
I don't have any interest in this

41:22.134 --> 41:24.273
There's no use also

41:39.167 --> 41:40.339
How is the milking going on

41:42.234 --> 41:43.542
Okay Okay

41:44.600 --> 41:46.773
India is a totally
changed country now

41:47.034 --> 41:48.240
You must be careful

41:48.333 --> 41:50.472
Nadi astrology often
predicts accurately

41:50.534 --> 41:53.674
if 'she' comes, she'll leave
only after getting back herVelkuzhu

41:53.734 --> 41:58.581
So get a transfer fast
and go to Trivandrum

41:58.734 --> 42:02.079
Haven't you heard?
Ketu will grab any chance to play mischief

42:02.467 --> 42:04.640
It will bring terrible
shame upon you

42:05.500 --> 42:07.036
Let me take leave

42:10.500 --> 42:11.672
Hari Om

42:48.634 --> 42:50.580
Don't touch me

42:51.334 --> 42:52.244
What's it?

42:52.300 --> 42:54.473
All this began
1000 years ago, right?

42:55.567 --> 42:56.671
What?

43:00.500 --> 43:02.207
Who among these is 'she'?

43:02.700 --> 43:04.043
Who 'she'?

43:04.600 --> 43:06.136
Your Vasanthamallika

43:08.734 --> 43:14.082
Vasanthamallika, Velkuzhukottuvan
and a king who is a villain of this story

43:14.134 --> 43:15.511
Silly woman!

43:15.567 --> 43:18.411
Couldn't you recognize it was
the story of the movie 'Manichitrathazhu'

43:18.500 --> 43:22.676
It was re-made in all
languages of the south

43:23.234 --> 43:26.215
Then how did the names
of your parents crop up?

43:26.300 --> 43:28.405
Don't try to fool me, okay?

43:29.800 --> 43:33.043
Sushu...what the heck
are you saying?

43:33.200 --> 43:37.046
Nowl know why my transfer
has remained pending for so long

43:37.400 --> 43:41.644
If some dancer is going to come
like Nadi Astrologer prophesied...?!

43:42.067 --> 43:43.410
On My God!

43:43.667 --> 43:45.237
You better beware man!

43:46.234 --> 43:49.340
The finger bends
Sushu...?

43:49.434 --> 43:50.504
Sushu my foot!

43:51.567 --> 43:54.480
Coming in all ready and
locking the door...dallier

43:57.034 --> 44:00.243
God! Why did that Nadi...!
Let me get my hands on him!

44:06.467 --> 44:11.075
So you were a famous poet
in the court of Chozha king last birth

44:11.167 --> 44:12.339
That is for sure

44:12.600 --> 44:16.776
Because that's why now you sit
and write out petitions this birth

44:17.133 --> 44:19.670
Poetry is nothing but
complaints about world

44:19.734 --> 44:25.241
Velukottuvan wrote poems
You write out petitions

44:26.600 --> 44:29.444
In spite of different births
the job is the same

44:29.534 --> 44:30.478
Writing

44:33.734 --> 44:35.611
Meet Jovita
Portugal

44:36.433 --> 44:39.505
Met her in Dubai
Now wants to meet her grand pa

44:39.567 --> 44:41.069
Vasco da gama

44:41.434 --> 44:42.412
But isn't that guy dead?

44:42.467 --> 44:44.504
I am taking her to Kochi tomorrow

44:47.134 --> 44:50.479
Meet my friends
Chandramohan, the priest, Sumesh

44:59.267 --> 45:00.507
What did she say about me?

45:00.567 --> 45:01.671
Didn't you figure out?

45:01.734 --> 45:03.304
That you are a big flirt

45:03.633 --> 45:06.113
I knew it when she said 'Ola'

45:06.167 --> 45:08.113
- What was it?
- That you were a cheapo

45:08.167 --> 45:09.703
She'd have said I was good

45:12.600 --> 45:16.207
Chandra, a wife and a lover
are two different things

45:16.700 --> 45:19.010
A male is never
satisfied with one mate

45:19.067 --> 45:22.207
Be it man or animal
It is scientifically proven

45:22.267 --> 45:25.111
Take for example, the deer
Do you know how many mates it has?

45:25.167 --> 45:26.168
Can you guess?

45:26.234 --> 45:27.110
No

45:27.167 --> 45:28.407
More than one hundred

45:28.467 --> 45:30.743
Really?!
I wish I was a deer

45:31.000 --> 45:32.673
Be serious, man

45:32.734 --> 45:36.375
A male will always jump
from one woman to another

45:36.700 --> 45:39.613
Even if she's a Tamilian
Let her first come to you

45:40.700 --> 45:43.237
Will you tell me the truth
if I asked you something?

45:43.300 --> 45:47.407
What will you do if this
Vasanthamallika really appears?

45:47.467 --> 45:50.004
Tell him you'll accept her
with open arms

45:50.100 --> 45:52.205
It's a sin to accept
another woman

45:52.267 --> 45:54.679
Oh come on!
You think you're great on morality

45:55.600 --> 45:58.274
It's always good to have a lover

45:58.500 --> 46:01.310
I once had 4 lovers at a time

46:02.300 --> 46:03.370
She will come

46:03.434 --> 46:06.142
Our VasanthamVasanthamoI

46:06.467 --> 46:08.469
Don't lead me astray Shekharetta

46:08.667 --> 46:10.305
Pour me one more

46:10.500 --> 46:12.480
We can't deny
existence of re-births

46:12.567 --> 46:15.639
Our famous psychologist Shyamshashi
Has written in his book

46:15.700 --> 46:16.576
Stop <i>m</i>

46:16.634 --> 46:18.375
Famous psychologist
My foot!

46:18.434 --> 46:20.414
The soul never dies

46:20.467 --> 46:22.140
Those meant to come
will surely come

46:22.200 --> 46:24.771
Even if eons pass
they will come

46:25.034 --> 46:26.638
There comes one such...look!

46:29.100 --> 46:30.670
Don't invite trouble from him

46:30.767 --> 46:32.269
Pour me one more

46:32.367 --> 46:34.074
Hey! Stop messing things up

46:35.334 --> 46:38.247
Very scared of his own son
God knows why

46:38.467 --> 46:40.606
Close friends
We're having juice

46:41.267 --> 46:42.610
He's grown so big

46:42.700 --> 46:44.475
He's a big shot too

46:44.534 --> 46:46.445
Picked up a fight
at the market

46:46.534 --> 46:47.774
Out on bail
only last week

46:48.000 --> 46:49.741
Has he finished
his graduation in Law?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.707
Not since last 8 years

46:51.767 --> 46:52.541
Look at that

46:52.634 --> 46:56.081
He behaves like
the boy was his father

46:56.134 --> 46:57.306
lam not going to let it go

46:57.400 --> 47:00.472
Whenever we ask him
he talks about bond of the soul etc:

47:00.567 --> 47:03.104
Today we must find out
what this is all about

47:03.167 --> 47:04.373
You ask

47:05.567 --> 47:07.046
Okay now tell us the truth

47:07.100 --> 47:07.601
What about?

47:07.667 --> 47:09.112
You must tell us today

47:09.567 --> 47:11.240
Why are you so scared of him?

47:11.300 --> 47:13.337
Are you his father
or is he your dad?

47:13.800 --> 47:15.336
He is my father

47:18.467 --> 47:21.380
A Nadi once told me this once
while at Rameshwaram

47:21.667 --> 47:26.047
He was a great politician
in his previous birth

47:28.567 --> 47:29.671
Continue

47:30.634 --> 47:33.046
I was his most wayward son

47:33.234 --> 47:35.510
Unable to tolerate my truants...

47:35.667 --> 47:40.707
...he swallowed his diamond ring
and committed suicide

47:43.767 --> 47:49.308
And in this birth he was born
as my son and I became his father

47:50.033 --> 47:55.278
Nadi does not lie
We have to reap what we sow

47:55.367 --> 47:57.404
Everything is linked
by our deeds in previous births

47:57.800 --> 48:01.407
Nothing will break
even if we tried to

48:13.700 --> 48:16.010
Chandramohana?!

48:17.534 --> 48:18.740
Sumesh?

48:22.067 --> 48:24.377
Can't he at least reply
saying he's asleep?!

48:32.000 --> 48:33.980
Has he left this town?

48:39.600 --> 48:41.136
Has he migrated?

48:41.233 --> 48:43.474
Are you sitting and sleeping?

48:44.734 --> 48:47.510
Can't you lie down to sleep
Such a lazy fellow

48:48.734 --> 48:51.146
But then who called me?

48:52.134 --> 48:55.013
Whoever it was
Thank goodness I didn't reply

50:21.167 --> 50:22.373
<i>Caesar'.!</i>

50:22.534 --> 50:24.377
No wonder he became a king

50:24.467 --> 50:25.639
I'll bequeath a sword!

50:49.034 --> 50:50.308
I am Geethanjali

50:53.300 --> 50:54.779
What is your complaint?

50:57.200 --> 50:58.338
Then?

50:58.434 --> 51:00.436
I came simply
Just to meet you

51:01.800 --> 51:03.711
Meet me?

51:09.467 --> 51:10.605
Fan of me?

51:11.134 --> 51:13.978
I have read many
of your articles

51:14.100 --> 51:17.274
Last month it was
Vyjayanthi Ramanathan

51:20.367 --> 51:21.675
Have you read that also?

51:21.733 --> 51:25.647
Read?
I've memorized most of it

51:28.434 --> 51:30.004
You are so observant

51:33.200 --> 51:35.111
Hey! Nothing like that

51:35.467 --> 51:37.708
I have seen you
at many functions

51:37.767 --> 51:40.179
But I have not been
able to meet and talk

51:42.067 --> 51:44.775
That's because...you are all big shots

51:45.534 --> 51:48.208
Hey! Not at all
I too am just ordinary humans

51:49.434 --> 51:50.777
What do you do?

51:51.000 --> 51:52.172
I am a doctor

51:52.300 --> 51:54.780
Oh! Is that so?
Where are you working?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.343
In Trivandrum or...?

51:58.467 --> 51:59.775
Kazhukoottam...

52:00.000 --> 52:01.638
...primary health centre

52:04.434 --> 52:08.143
Oh! I see!
So you are that doctor!

52:09.667 --> 52:12.045
So you are not here
to simply meet me

52:12.100 --> 52:13.477
Sir...

52:13.567 --> 52:17.344
There is a whole lot of
complaints against you

52:17.433 --> 52:20.778
Never comes on time to hospital
Behaves badly to patients

52:21.000 --> 52:22.274
Mistakes in prescribing medicines

52:22.367 --> 52:25.280
This contains the complaints
of people from a whole town

52:25.467 --> 52:29.643
This is the file forwarded to us
from the District Medical Officer

52:34.033 --> 52:37.014
You can expect minimum
a suspension from post

52:37.100 --> 52:38.977
Sir, please don't
do such things

52:39.234 --> 52:40.736
Then what must I do?

52:41.034 --> 52:42.707
All these complaints are true

52:44.434 --> 52:47.244
But you must listen
to my version also

52:47.534 --> 52:49.411
Only you will understand

52:49.767 --> 52:52.179
That's why I came here

52:52.434 --> 52:54.573
Please sir
You must help me

52:55.100 --> 52:56.636
What do you want me to do?

52:56.700 --> 52:58.008
Bury n?

52:58.100 --> 53:02.242
No sir, just leave it aside
for at least 2 months

53:03.234 --> 53:05.339
Madam, that's not going to help

53:05.433 --> 53:07.674
Even if it's 4 months
the file will be taken out

53:07.734 --> 53:09.736
And action will be
taken against you

53:11.600 --> 53:15.980
Sir, what I am about to
tell you is very personal

53:16.767 --> 53:18.713
Basically I am a dancer

53:25.200 --> 53:26.679
Chinnasatya's...?

53:27.400 --> 53:28.504
Student

53:31.300 --> 53:32.438
Is that so?

53:32.600 --> 53:35.240
Yes, but dad insisted
I study medicine

53:35.367 --> 53:38.541
Since dad was in the railways
we lived in Chennai till recently

53:39.567 --> 53:40.705
Mother is a Tamilian, from Madurai

53:43.200 --> 53:48.081
lam quite fed up sir
Hundreds of diseases, drugs...!

53:48.500 --> 53:53.108
When I write the prescription
I don't know why but I'm totally blank

53:57.067 --> 53:58.444
I want only my dance

53:58.634 --> 54:03.049
I had almost decided
when this petition cropped up

54:03.633 --> 54:07.206
In Octoberl have a trip
with my guru

54:07.667 --> 54:10.614
His troupe is leaving
for Germany, Frankfurt

54:10.667 --> 54:12.613
It's a fusion item from
our whole group

54:13.134 --> 54:14.704
I have a solo also

54:15.434 --> 54:19.177
If this file is forwarded
to the petition committee...

54:20.400 --> 54:24.314
...everything will be in a mess
and my trip canceled

54:31.267 --> 54:33.110
Sir you must help me

54:35.600 --> 54:39.241
Only an artist can
understand another

54:47.767 --> 54:49.269
We'll see

54:53.700 --> 54:56.544
Don't worry...we'll see

54:58.734 --> 55:01.146
- Can I call you, sir?
-Sure

55:15.533 --> 55:20.448
One who resembles the Palasa flower
Who is head of the family of stars

55:20.600 --> 55:26.346
Violent and fearsome like Lord Shiva
Ketu, I offer you my obeisance

55:26.433 --> 55:28.003
Did you write it all down?

55:29.334 --> 55:33.976
Ask Chandran sir to chant this
whenever he gets time

55:34.167 --> 55:37.410
This is the only way
to appease Ketu

55:37.700 --> 55:39.646
What's happening
to your transfer?

55:39.700 --> 55:41.145
He is trying to get it

55:41.200 --> 55:44.306
Not good enough
You must also try

55:44.500 --> 55:47.777
Why not tell
our Zachariah sir?

55:48.200 --> 55:52.080
He has great influence
at ministerial levels

55:52.467 --> 55:57.610
It's not that Chandran sir
does not want to get you there

55:57.667 --> 55:59.738
But this Ketu plays against him

56:00.234 --> 56:04.705
Lord Shaneeshwara
Please see her transfer happens

56:05.667 --> 56:07.510
Dance Treat

56:10.167 --> 56:12.977
Does that mean we see
the dance and get a treat?

56:13.067 --> 56:14.410
Let's eat

56:14.467 --> 56:16.310
Be quiet!
You ignorant fool!

56:17.734 --> 56:19.714
Call me when it's about to finish
I'll come

56:19.767 --> 56:20.677
Call me...?

56:20.734 --> 56:21.974
What?
Tamil?

56:22.067 --> 56:24.547
- Can't you understand?
- Sounds more like swearing

56:25.234 --> 56:26.304
Sir!

56:27.500 --> 56:29.309
I knew you'd be here today

56:30.767 --> 56:33.043
Do you like Mrinalini?

56:33.567 --> 56:36.673
L...such questions...!

56:38.234 --> 56:39.577
Shall we go in?

56:42.100 --> 56:46.640
I've heard she prefers
expressions to rhythm

56:47.534 --> 56:50.208
I also have often felt so

56:50.467 --> 56:51.445
Thank God

56:54.067 --> 56:56.513
Speak softly
Her fans are allover here

56:56.800 --> 56:58.108
Let's go

57:04.400 --> 57:09.400
'Greetings to Lord Garuda'

57:46.267 --> 57:50.010
It's been a 1000 years since
you saw her dance, isn't it?

57:50.700 --> 57:52.111
Watch her

57:52.333 --> 57:53.710
Vasanthamallika

58:45.033 --> 58:46.706
INTERVAL

58:50.500 --> 58:52.138
Can you hear me?

58:54.467 --> 58:57.175
Must be watching some
dancer and her antics

58:57.467 --> 58:59.242
Function! My foot!

58:59.367 --> 59:01.608
Earlier he used to call
once every evening

59:01.667 --> 59:04.511
Now that's done with
He now cuts my call

59:05.067 --> 59:06.603
Mom, have you seen
my com passes?

59:06.667 --> 59:08.169
I swallowed it!

59:08.500 --> 59:09.740
You'll die

59:09.800 --> 59:12.076
Ayyo!
Mom's gonna die!

59:19.534 --> 59:21.275
How are you going back?

59:21.334 --> 59:23.245
My friend will pick me up

59:23.467 --> 59:24.605
I can drop you

59:24.667 --> 59:26.305
No, it's okay
I'll go by myself

59:26.367 --> 59:29.507
We can talk during the drive
Ask your friend not to come

59:29.800 --> 59:31.575
- All that is fine
- Okay

59:31.634 --> 59:33.204
Look! It's him

59:35.067 --> 59:36.375
I'll go get my car

59:36.467 --> 59:38.310
Chandra!
Look here

59:41.500 --> 59:43.741
My friends
Come

59:45.234 --> 59:48.477
- He didn't expect us
-Who is that lady?

59:52.067 --> 59:54.069
- Meet Shekhar'ettan
-I am Shekhar Menon

59:54.200 --> 59:56.305
Gita, I have not yet
seen your dance program

59:56.367 --> 59:58.108
But you must inform me next time

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.980
Shekhar'etan was a journalist
with the Indian Express

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:03.740
But not any more
His family lives abroad

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.775
- I am Sumesh
- Meet Sumesh

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.037
He is Brahmasree Narayanan llayathu

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.408
- Hello!
- Hello, sir!

01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:13.778
- Next time you must inform me
- Of course she will

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.603
Sure

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.610
Let's take leave

01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:16.611
okay

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:18.645
Okay see you

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.701
You get in

01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:20.711
Bye

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.443
Aren't you coming?

01:00:57.034 --> 01:00:58.138
Get in man

01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:05.478
Where are you off to?

01:01:05.567 --> 01:01:07.513
Come here
Today we go in the car

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.538
I am already here

01:01:12.634 --> 01:01:13.612
I am also here

01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:14.668
Move in dude

01:01:15.267 --> 01:01:17.611
Finally she came and
you have got her number

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:18.702
who?

01:01:19.367 --> 01:01:20.710
Vasanthamallika

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.381
The divine dancer in the court
of King Raja Raja Chozhan

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.211
Be quiet

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.674
I saw it in her eyes
when she was looking at you

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.980
- What?
- Love

01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:35.744
Well, you think it's love
when any girl looks at you

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.108
Get lost man

01:01:37.567 --> 01:01:40.047
She is in love with him
And he loves her too

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.306
Be quiet

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.776
What must we do to
bring love in the eye?

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.741
Pour some eye drops

01:01:47.334 --> 01:01:49.314
But it will only hurt

01:01:50.234 --> 01:01:53.044
Love is a strange experience

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.276
Like he says, it's a kind of ache
and you must go through it

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.374
Do you see that?

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.474
All these stars
are in love with Chandran(moon)

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.343
But the moon loves
only one person

01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:10.638
Rohini
(a star corresponding to Aldebaran)

01:02:10.734 --> 01:02:15.149
The moon's mission in life
is to reach Rohini's heart

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.238
Once he reaches her
he becomes complete

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.338
That day will be
a full moon night

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.006
From the moment he begins
gravitating away from her

01:02:24.067 --> 01:02:27.139
He becomes thinner
and thinner in yearning

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.409
Finally he sets
Just as a thin arc

01:02:31.167 --> 01:02:32.771
That day will be
the new moon

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.713
Next day, once again
he begins his journey to Rohini

01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:40.145
Ajourney that never ends

01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:42.771
Hey! Wah!
Great poet

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.446
What a beautiful story
isn't it?

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.036
You continue your dip

01:02:48.134 --> 01:02:52.412
It's only love that gives you
a sense of completeness

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:56.342
It will give you
a new confidence

01:02:58.033 --> 01:03:00.138
You'll see the world with new eyes

01:03:00.634 --> 01:03:02.204
You'll start writing

01:03:02.467 --> 01:03:03.741
who?
Me?

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.374
Aw come on Shekharetta!

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.978
Just you wait and see
You'll soon start writing

- Hello
-I am Geethanjali

01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:05.337
Were you asleep?

01:04:05.434 --> 01:04:06.310
No

01:04:07.767 --> 01:04:12.512
Can I recite a verse
I just composed?

01:04:18.534 --> 01:04:26.510
"Come to me, lover boy"

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:33.381
"Come to me, handsome guy"

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:47.151
"A fragrance who fills my heart
Be with me, lovely as spring forever"

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:55.745

dancer divine, be only mine"

01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:10.443
"Amillion poems awaken
just looking at you"

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:18.475
"In your dance footsteps
beats my life's rhythm in tune"

01:05:18.534 --> 01:05:26.544
"Your sweetness make me swoon
I remain a poet besotted with you"

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:33.245
"Come to me, my handsome guy"

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:43.310
"A fragrance who fills my heart
Be with me, lovely as spring forever"

01:05:43.367 --> 01:05:51.149

On pages of time our love story"

As we continues the saga today too"

01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:30.582
"Your touch, even stone pillars
hum unending music"

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.504
Responsibility?

01:07:45.334 --> 01:07:47.610
Hey! You! What do you
think you are doing?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.241
Where is Dr Geethanjali's file?

01:07:50.334 --> 01:07:52.211
Don't get me into trouble

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.406
That has to be submitted
at the next committee sitting

01:07:56.534 --> 01:07:59.310
What is it?
Why the glare man?

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.971
The file can be submitted
in the next sitting after that, okay?

01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:05.037
That's not for you to decide
Just do as I say

01:08:05.233 --> 01:08:07.440
- If I don't?
- If you don't...?

01:08:07.534 --> 01:08:10.140
What will you do if I don't?

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:12.180
What the heck
will you do man?

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.243
What?!

01:08:18.567 --> 01:08:20.274
Dude! It's you...?

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.615
Not just one or two
It's been 1000 years of torture

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.613
A king then,
now a section-officer

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.647
A battle in those days
Today a committee

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.145
Betrayal those days
Today file issue

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:39.782
Nothing doing!
You'll never see that file again

01:08:40.466 --> 01:08:43.505
Do you understand
you Raja Raja silly Chozha?

01:08:43.567 --> 01:08:46.514
Chandra, what's all this
What are you blabbering?

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.103
I want your blood

01:08:50.533 --> 01:08:51.774
Okay, done

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.537
You can take blood,
urine, sputum anything

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.238
Do you suffer
high blood pressure?

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.407
Oh! Stop glaring like this
I am really scared now

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.604
Cool down

01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:02.975
Sit down for some time

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.143
It's me
Do cool down

01:09:08.134 --> 01:09:10.238
Can I order
a juice for you?

01:09:17.033 --> 01:09:20.277
Hey! Get him a juice with ice
Let him cool down

01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:22.108
This is not going to stop
with mere juice

01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:23.669
You'll definitely need
other means of treatment!

01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:42.439
You'll come
this evening, won't you?

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.036
I'll be waiting for you

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.138
Wife

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:48.401
Whose?

01:09:51.067 --> 01:09:56.067
"Like a knock on the doors of watsapp
Like a loving caress on the touch screen"

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.036
I swear it's true
You need not worry Anjali

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.971
That file will not pop up
anywhere in the near future

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:12.508
You go ahead, to Germany
Italy or where ever

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.070
When you get fed up of dancing
just come back here

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.205
Your life is not destined
to be wasted in some hospital

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:34.546
The world of an needs
talented dancers like you

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.477
Remember the day
you came to see me

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:43.344
The very first day I
realized a spark in you

01:10:43.467 --> 01:10:48.109
lam an artist too
That's why I recognized it

01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:53.173
But, in spite of 5 years
Anand could never understand it

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.371
Who is this Anand?

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:57.771
My fiance

01:11:02.434 --> 01:11:04.277
We had exchanged rings too

01:11:05.034 --> 01:11:06.479
But it didn't take off from there

01:11:07.767 --> 01:11:09.576
- Dad's friend
- Excuse me

01:11:09.667 --> 01:11:11.112
Forget the peg

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:14.705
He was dad's friend's son

01:11:15.234 --> 01:11:19.011
He was actually planning
to shift to Australia

01:11:19.301 --> 01:11:23.511
But came back and built
a multi-specialty hospital

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.443
He wanted to chop up limbs
and get back what he invested

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.512
But I did not agree to all that
I said I wanted to learn dance

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.738
With that we parted ways

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.213
To him dance was like
an activity one does at a gym

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:44.013
He has no idea about an

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.638
He does not listen to even music

01:11:50.067 --> 01:11:52.206
I tried to adjust

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.338
But it just didn't happen

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.274
Anyway good it didn't happen
Leave it

01:12:01.434 --> 01:12:05.712
The petition committee chairman's
help was a great blessing

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:10.078
He is a man from my camp
We are evening glassmates

01:12:12.067 --> 01:12:14.013
Booze has such advantages like this

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.172
People grow closer in
such short periods of knowing

01:12:17.234 --> 01:12:20.010
- Like we do now
- True

01:12:23.767 --> 01:12:26.509
I do feel it when sitting with you

01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:38.711
The feel of an ice block
melting into the liquor

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.736
Isn't it like that?

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.178
I know it

01:12:54.434 --> 01:12:56.107
Great song

01:12:56.334 --> 01:12:58.245
- Want it louder?
-A bit

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:12.109
"Don't leave me in misery
promise me you'll return"

01:13:20.334 --> 01:13:27.218
"Look at those dark strands of hair
let the clouds not steal them"

01:13:28.401 --> 01:13:36.650
"Let not streaks of lightening
steal away your brightness"

01:13:36.734 --> 01:13:46.246
"Don't take steps forward all alone
promise me you'll be back soon"

01:13:47.567 --> 01:13:52.448
What if the King Raja Raja Chozhan
comes to know of our relationship...?

01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:55.703
King Raja Raja Chozhan?

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:02.270
That is...

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.609
You've gone a bit overboard...?

01:14:06.801 --> 01:14:08.337
Not exactly
Yeah

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.242
A little

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.244
Oh...!

01:14:10.334 --> 01:14:13.372
Do you mind if I get down here?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.180
- So good night
- Sugoneta?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.001
So good night

01:14:20.634 --> 01:14:22.341
Is that what it is?

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:26.046
Wonder why I am like this

01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:28.647
So take care

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.405
Should I drop you?

01:14:37.034 --> 01:14:39.207
An unforgettable night

01:14:56.434 --> 01:15:04.080
Look at the bed of roses
Sumesh!

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.370
Gotcha!

01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:19.376
Sumesh, why are you
dressed up like Sushma?

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.007
I am Sushma

01:15:22.734 --> 01:15:24.077
What?!

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.439
No need to pinch yourself
It's me for real

01:15:31.534 --> 01:15:33.741
Hey! Sushu?!

01:15:34.634 --> 01:15:36.545
When did you come
and from where?

01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.979
Was your journey...?

01:15:40.034 --> 01:15:42.480
- Hey! Brother-in-law?!
- No I am your aunt

01:15:42.534 --> 01:15:43.979
Loo k!

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.109
Brother-in-lamf?
Are your cows okay?

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:49.340
Only one of them
Got a bad back ache

01:15:49.434 --> 01:15:52.415
Standing like this full time
Nothing else apart from that

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.775
Didn't I tell you?
He has a great sense of humor

01:15:59.167 --> 01:16:01.340
If he was in the movies, he'd...

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.379
...get the best comedian award

01:16:05.434 --> 01:16:08.415
But you'll get the award
for best acting, Chandra'etta

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:11.774
Look at that act put on
after getting stone drunk

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.173
It's not like what you think

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:15.610
Only now and then
Everyday

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:18.477
He is not like us
He's an artist, right?

01:16:18.567 --> 01:16:23.607
If a fan comes and offers dinner
won't he be obliged to go?

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:26.307
Something like that
has happened today, rig ht?

01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:27.641
You are fueling the fire, eh?

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.408
So it's not writing alone
There's a treat too

01:16:30.767 --> 01:16:33.077
Have you come here
to find fault with me?

01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:34.078
No

01:16:34.267 --> 01:16:35.507
Just move aside

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.337
Hope you get me
when I said 'sir'

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.573
Let her leave
I'll deal with you

01:16:41.167 --> 01:16:42.612
I got my transfer

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.977
Transferred where?

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:49.774
Here of course
Where else?

01:16:51.767 --> 01:16:53.337
Without my knowing?

01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:56.507
But you are not the one
giving me transfer order

01:17:00.201 --> 01:17:04.513
You kept promising me
since last 2 years

01:17:04.634 --> 01:17:07.672
Since it never happened
I decided to try for it myself

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.540
Our Zacharaiah sir's relative
has great influences ministerial levels

01:17:12.634 --> 01:17:16.138
I had to shell out Rs 25000
But so what...l got what I wanted

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.472
Why didn't you tell me all this?

01:17:20.534 --> 01:17:23.208
How many days
since you called me

01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:26.041
Now it's my fault

01:17:27.334 --> 01:17:29.610
All this is not at all right

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.008
Hear me bro

01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:37.674
She is a little addle brained
At least you could have explained

01:17:37.767 --> 01:17:40.475
Is it enough you get
a transfer order and land here?

01:17:40.534 --> 01:17:43.640
We need a house
A School for Achu

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.236
Don't you worry
on any of those issues

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:45.710
Why?

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:46.768
I have taken care of everything

01:17:47.034 --> 01:17:47.478
<i>How?</i>

01:17:47.534 --> 01:17:49.172
His school closes next week

01:17:49.234 --> 01:17:54.206
Our aunt's daughter Chinchu's house
is lying vacant and is fully furnished

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.370
Chinchu's?

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:56.673
Here are the keys

01:17:56.767 --> 01:18:00.112
After arranging everything
I'll leave tomorrow

01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:01.212
Enough?

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.143
What an idea!

01:18:04.334 --> 01:18:06.746
I was just leaving
to buy snacks

01:18:09.567 --> 01:18:13.310
Brother-in-law
That hit was below the belt

01:18:13.467 --> 01:18:16.778
- I have only one sister, right?
-I call that true affection

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.674
It was too bad of you

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:29.116
lam right behind you now
Okay Chandra'etta?

01:19:11.634 --> 01:19:14.137
I chanted 5- 6 times
Isn't that enough?

01:19:14.267 --> 01:19:16.474
No! You must
chant 21 times

01:19:17.434 --> 01:19:19.038
Get lost you Ketu

01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:19.703
Mom!

01:19:19.767 --> 01:19:20.711
I mean monu (son)

01:19:20.801 --> 01:19:22.610
Stop playing the fool

01:19:30.201 --> 01:19:32.374
- You joined yesterday, eh?
-Yeah

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.447
I was on leave
Had gone home

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:37.277
Don't you know
She's Chandramohan's wife

01:19:37.734 --> 01:19:38.712
Is that so?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.240
Do you know him?

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.506
Do I know him?

01:19:41.567 --> 01:19:44.776
Please do me a favor
My daughter Unnimaya

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.446
She is a little crazy about dance

01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:51.341
She won the first place
2010 school events

01:19:51.434 --> 01:19:55.473
Please ask him to write
a few words in the papers

01:19:55.634 --> 01:19:57.614
He also is besotted
with dance, right?

01:19:57.701 --> 01:19:59.203
You can do it
if you set your mind

01:19:59.267 --> 01:20:01.008
Why don t you
encourage her?

01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:03.240
Are you also interested in dance?

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.545
Nol am crazy about in sports

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.104
Which game?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.201
<i>Kambava“</i>

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.112
Muruga
Where is that file?

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.540
Is there only one fried fritter?

01:20:16.634 --> 01:20:17.738
Hey! I want that one

01:20:18.234 --> 01:20:19.577
You powdered it to bits

01:20:19.634 --> 01:20:21.307
Well, that's how to eat it

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:23.210
There comes the afternoon call

01:20:24.401 --> 01:20:27.007
- Where are you Chandra'etta?
- Shut up

01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:33.082
I have packed the fried chilli
in the 2nd container

01:20:34.734 --> 01:20:38.079
Couldn't you have kept it along
with the fryums in the last container

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:43.215
We have to go to Big Bazar
I have some more things to buy

01:20:43.267 --> 01:20:44.007
okay

01:20:44.067 --> 01:20:47.708
I'll take an auto
you can wait for me

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.780
ls the bitter gourd too salty?

01:20:52.067 --> 01:20:55.446
Doesn't matter
At least the chilli is long enough

01:20:55.534 --> 01:20:58.276
Such joy with my tongue
spouting flames

01:20:58.334 --> 01:20:59.677
You must send
some more, okay?

01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:01.304
I'll call you later okay?

01:21:04.467 --> 01:21:05.707
That's a chilli

01:21:08.334 --> 01:21:11.406
- Dad, let's eat at a hotel today
- Sure why not

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:12.377
Let's go to Pankaj

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.674
Nothing doing!
Do you have to eat at expensive places

01:21:14.767 --> 01:21:17.111
We get good stuff at Abhirami
That will do

01:21:17.234 --> 01:21:17.974
Dad?

01:21:18.034 --> 01:21:20.071
We'll go to Abhirami
and then to Pankaj, son

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:21.703
'A lady doctor sustained injuries'

01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:24.008
'Kazhukootam
Primary Health Centre...'

01:21:24.067 --> 01:21:27.981
'...doctor Geethanjali was attacked
by a group of people'

01:21:28.034 --> 01:21:33.211
'It happened when those
injured in a police lathi charge...'

01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:35.338
'...were taken to the hospital'

01:21:35.401 --> 01:21:38.143
'When people realized that
the doctor was on leave most days...'

01:21:38.234 --> 01:21:40.077
'...a group of people went to her house'

01:21:40.134 --> 01:21:43.377
Hey! Will this do?

01:21:43.634 --> 01:21:47.980
'Dr Geethanjali is now undergoing treatment
at the Trivandrum Medical College'

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.609
I must go to Medical college

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:52.647
- What happened?
-An accident

01:21:52.767 --> 01:21:54.144
What about us?

01:21:54.734 --> 01:21:57.214
Be here, I'll be right back

01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:00.304
Just one hour
Buy anything you want

01:22:00.401 --> 01:22:03.974
- Shall I take this doll chimp
- Why another one when your dad is here

01:22:04.067 --> 01:22:06.377
Look at him running
Go leave it back

01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:23.447
I came to know only now

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.480
That's why I'm so late

01:22:36.634 --> 01:22:39.774
You've come
That's enough for me

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.341
The vodaphone number
you have called is switched off

01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:54.245
- Didn't you get through?
- Its switched off

01:22:55.467 --> 01:22:59.176
Anyway keep this stuff
I will take it in the morning

01:22:59.234 --> 01:23:00.645
Call Sumesh uncle

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.306
For that, shouldn't I
have his number Achu?!

01:23:03.367 --> 01:23:05.779
Call Janu uncle
He will have his number

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.274
Call uncle

01:23:08.634 --> 01:23:10.170
Hey! Not bad
You are quite clever

01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:12.612
For that, you need brains

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.310
What is it, sis?

01:23:14.367 --> 01:23:16.711
Do you have
Sumesh's number?

01:23:20.134 --> 01:23:21.078
Sir

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.070
Stop all this right away

01:23:23.134 --> 01:23:23.703
All what?

01:23:23.767 --> 01:23:27.214
Sushma'echi is here
Stop before things get nasty

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.509
Remember, you are
not Shekhar'etan

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.104
You've saved her number
using her own name, right?

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:46.077
Yeah
Why?

01:23:46.134 --> 01:23:48.307
It'll be easy for
your wife to find out

01:23:48.367 --> 01:23:49.505
Okay, see you

01:24:06.767 --> 01:24:08.769
Geetha Nandan

01:24:30.667 --> 01:24:34.615
When they said it was an accident,
I didn't expect he'd be dead

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:39.082
By the time I reached there
his skull was smashed to pulp

01:24:39.334 --> 01:24:41.211
I couldn't bear to see it Sushu

01:24:41.567 --> 01:24:43.740
Although we were not
in the same section...

01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:46.372
...we used to have
lunch together everyday

01:24:46.467 --> 01:24:49.505
Even today he relished
the mashed prawn dish you'd made

01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:56.247
Said he'd never tasted
anything so good...poor guy!

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.747
Sounds like he got smashed up
after eating my mashed prawns dish

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.370
What?!

01:25:01.434 --> 01:25:04.972
I've heard people
forget their purse or phone

01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:08.607
This is the first I've heard of
someone forgetting his wife and kid

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:11.511
Since Sumesh was there we
got here without unpleasantness

01:25:11.567 --> 01:25:15.640
- Sushma, I was distraught-
- Oh just Shut up

01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:23.477
"lmmersed in feelings of love"

01:25:23.534 --> 01:25:26.344
"Desires enveloping wholly"

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.779
"And Chandran...!"

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:33.375
He must be happy
that his friend is dead

01:25:37.067 --> 01:25:39.308
Dad!
Phone

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:41.036
Who is it?

01:25:41.234 --> 01:25:43.145
Geetha Nandan

01:25:43.334 --> 01:25:44.608
Shall I pick it?

01:25:46.567 --> 01:25:49.309
- No don't take it
-Aw, it got cut

01:25:49.367 --> 01:25:51.108
Dad it got cut

01:25:54.634 --> 01:25:57.342
I should have taken it
with me into the bathroom

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.602
Who is it
I wonder?

01:26:08.101 --> 01:26:09.375
- Foam
- What?

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.678
Whew!
Escaped!

01:26:17.334 --> 01:26:19.245
Came along with a tour group

01:26:19.334 --> 01:26:25.250
Thought I'd see you and
pray at Sri Padmanabha temple

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.677
Where are the others now?

01:26:26.734 --> 01:26:30.580
They have all gone to the zoo
to see the anaconda

01:26:30.734 --> 01:26:33.408
I chose to come here

01:26:35.534 --> 01:26:37.514
Hope you are religiously
performing the rituals for Ketu?

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:40.673
Sure! Here also I am lighting
the sesame oil lamp everyday

01:26:40.734 --> 01:26:42.179
That's very good

01:26:42.767 --> 01:26:45.771
The compensation rituals
alone are not enough

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:50.410
You must keep him away
from the presence of women

01:26:52.167 --> 01:26:54.443
Its just a matter of
another 8 months

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.707
After that Venus will begin influence

01:26:57.334 --> 01:27:00.110
You have to be very careful
regarding food as well

01:27:02.434 --> 01:27:05.278
Don't give him
too many drumsticks

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:06.210
Why not?

01:27:06.267 --> 01:27:10.477
It will cause problems
Increases libido

01:27:12.534 --> 01:27:16.175
But you can give him
plenty of garlic

01:27:21.367 --> 01:27:23.244
No need for drumsticks

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.042
How can sam bar taste good
without drum sticks?

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.301
Anything else?

01:27:27.401 --> 01:27:29.608
1 kilo garlic
A kilo?

01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:31.778
To make pickle

01:27:59.734 --> 01:28:03.181
- Did it become a problem?
- No, the program was jam packed

01:28:03.234 --> 01:28:04.679
Love for the fine ans!

01:28:13.267 --> 01:28:16.714
Listen, I am in
an important meeting at office

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.143
I'll call you later

01:28:25.734 --> 01:28:32.208
'Vasanthamallika will come
in search of her unrequited love'

01:28:32.534 --> 01:28:39.008
'To reclaim the love lost
in her previous incarnation'

01:28:47.734 --> 01:28:49.372
This sambar looks like rasam

01:28:49.434 --> 01:28:51.038
It doesn't seem
to have any veggies

01:28:51.134 --> 01:28:52.442
Isn't there drumstick in it?

01:28:52.534 --> 01:28:54.411
Your problem is
eating too much drumsticks

01:28:54.467 --> 01:28:56.572
Dad, what's the problem
eating too many drumsticks?

01:28:56.634 --> 01:28:59.080
We'll have more guests
to eat food at home

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.169
What do you want?
Rice or Chappathi?

01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:02.143
Bat u ra

01:29:02.601 --> 01:29:04.706
<i>Baum'.
Eat whatev er' s there</i>

01:29:05.167 --> 01:29:07.613
Father and son are
the same in all ways!

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:10.045
Why is she hitting me
for your demand for batura?

01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:12.204
Who taught you all these
unpronounceable foods?

01:29:12.267 --> 01:29:15.180
- I didn't say anything
- Full of tricks up your sleeve

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.337
Barely hatched from the egg!
Batura!

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.470
What's the problem
with batura?

01:29:18.567 --> 01:29:20.205
Get lost
Look, learn from your dad

01:29:20.267 --> 01:29:24.181
Even without drumsticks see me
eating sam bar and rice with gusto

01:29:24.367 --> 01:29:26.574
- Eat my son
- I don't want

01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:29.341
Don't disturb your
mother's peace of mind

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.208
Geetha Nandan

01:29:30.267 --> 01:29:31.245
Then I'll eat

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:34.335
Eat

01:29:36.101 --> 01:29:38.172
Now quickly pop it
into your mouth

01:29:46.467 --> 01:29:48.310
<i>Now I'm WT'! haPP'!</i>

01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:53.238
- Are you full?
-Yes

01:29:54.401 --> 01:29:56.642
Good boy, nowl can
sleep peacefully

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.646
Oh God!

01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:10.408
Where has he gone?

01:30:29.467 --> 01:30:31.003
God!

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.643
You Chandramohan!

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.570
Tsunamii!!!

01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:18.169
But there's no salt
in this sea water

01:31:18.234 --> 01:31:19.212
My house is still intact

01:31:19.267 --> 01:31:20.644
Where did this
water come from?

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.737
Did you pour
water on my head

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.074
I was dreaming

01:31:24.767 --> 01:31:27.475
Why the hell do you dream
of throwing water over me?

01:31:27.567 --> 01:31:30.013
My sleep is gone
I can't go to tuition tomorrow

01:31:30.367 --> 01:31:33.644
Great!
'Strike while the iron is hot' right?!

01:31:33.767 --> 01:31:35.178
Why should I have a bath now?

01:31:35.234 --> 01:31:37.214
I can just brush my teeth
and go to office

01:31:40.467 --> 01:31:42.276
It's only 2 o clock?

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.440
How can I sleep here
another4 hours?

01:31:47.167 --> 01:31:48.475
I'll sleep outside

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.546
No!
Sleep here

01:31:50.634 --> 01:31:52.614
Why?
You want to drown and kill me?

01:31:52.667 --> 01:31:54.078
Then I'll come outside too

01:31:54.167 --> 01:31:57.080
Why bother?
When I can easily sleep here

01:31:57.167 --> 01:31:59.579
Goodness! Better wear
a helmet before sleeping

01:31:59.634 --> 01:32:01.204
I should buy one tomorrow

01:32:02.401 --> 01:32:04.438
125232

01:32:04.767 --> 01:32:06.405
What was the name
you mentioned?

01:32:06.467 --> 01:32:08.743
Geetha Nandan
That's a fake name

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.103
It's not Geetha Nandan
It's Geethanjali

01:32:13.734 --> 01:32:18.734
<i>tiff </i>

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:52.477
Hello ?

01:32:55.034 --> 01:32:56.479
Ah! Ketu has begun its game

01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:59.344
This is her for sure
That Vasanthamallika

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.773
Now there's nothing to wait for

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.480
Go right after him, our Chandran sir

01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:06.441
Go I Say!

01:33:10.634 --> 01:33:12.341
Hello, where are you?

01:33:12.434 --> 01:33:14.175
I'm in office
Why?

01:33:22.634 --> 01:33:24.079

01:33:30.501 --> 01:33:32.378
Where is Chandra Mohan sir?

01:33:32.434 --> 01:33:33.708
Sir is on leave today

01:33:37.667 --> 01:33:39.704
There's absolutely no doubt

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.473

Hello Ms Geethanjali?

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.046
Yes Geethanjali speaking

01:34:03.201 --> 01:34:04.407
Hello Ma'am

01:34:04.467 --> 01:34:08.074
I've been trying to call you for ages
I just got through

01:34:08.701 --> 01:34:09.611
Who is this?

01:34:09.667 --> 01:34:11.408
Oh I forgot to introduce myself

01:34:11.467 --> 01:34:14.710
My name is Sunandha,
My home is at Ottapalam

01:34:14.767 --> 01:34:18.772
I work here in Trivandrum
I'm a big fan of yours

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.411
Thank you so much

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.205
who?

01:34:21.301 --> 01:34:25.113
Weren't you pan of a dance show
at the Thrissur Regional theater last week?

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.237
Yes, were you there?

01:34:27.301 --> 01:34:30.646
I had come to see that
I even got your autograph

01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:33.511
I'm sorry but I'm unable to recall

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:37.606
Oh that's not a problem
you were quite busy that day

01:34:38.534 --> 01:34:41.071
So where is your family?

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:42.442
My parents live in Madurai

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:46.471
- And your husband?
- I'm not married

01:34:52.767 --> 01:34:56.442
Don't falter
Don't let it go...call her

01:35:01.634 --> 01:35:04.547
- Sorry it got cut
-Who is it?

01:35:04.634 --> 01:35:07.012
I'm Sunandha
I just called a while back

01:35:07.067 --> 01:35:09.240
- Oh yes
-Who is it?

01:35:09.567 --> 01:35:12.741
I have to meet you
When can I see you?

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.340
Oh I'm going
to Germany for a program

01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:20.112
So I'll be a bit busy

01:35:20.367 --> 01:35:21.971
Oh where are you now?

01:35:22.067 --> 01:35:24.445
I must meet you
Please madam

01:35:24.534 --> 01:35:26.309
I'm at a travel agent right now

01:35:26.367 --> 01:35:28.472
Which travel agent?
I'll come there

01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:31.577
Mayura travels
Aristo junction

01:35:31.634 --> 01:35:33.443
Okay madam
I'll come there

01:35:34.634 --> 01:35:36.011
okay

01:35:36.401 --> 01:35:37.436
Mayura!

01:35:38.034 --> 01:35:40.571
Mayura means peacock

01:35:41.267 --> 01:35:44.111
Who rides the Peacock?
Lord Muruga

01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:45.678
Where is Muruga's abode?

01:35:45.734 --> 01:35:47.577
Muruga is worshipped at Pazhani

01:35:47.634 --> 01:35:49.511
And how many wives
does Muruga have?

01:35:49.567 --> 01:35:50.443
One

01:35:50.534 --> 01:35:52.741
You donkey
He has two

01:35:53.734 --> 01:35:55.714
There are so many
travel agents there

01:35:55.767 --> 01:35:59.647
Why did she pick
Mayura in particular?

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.573
That is because
of her link with Tamil

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.111
Go there without delay

01:36:05.167 --> 01:36:06.703
Go
Go follow her

01:36:07.567 --> 01:36:12.567
<i>MBRHDRG </i>

01:36:53.134 --> 01:36:54.772
Go on
Follow that car

01:37:00.534 --> 01:37:02.309
They are right in front of me

01:37:11.267 --> 01:37:12.644
Go fast, brother

01:37:37.634 --> 01:37:39.170
Stop here please

01:37:46.334 --> 01:37:50.441
My Germany trip happened
only because you hid that file

01:37:51.434 --> 01:37:53.414
You struggled a lot for me

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.610
What can I do
to repay you for this?

01:37:57.367 --> 01:38:01.474
Oh I don't need
anything in return

01:38:01.534 --> 01:38:03.172
I'll break your head

01:38:05.501 --> 01:38:07.003
What happened?

01:38:07.367 --> 01:38:10.314
I was...suddenly...l...

01:38:10.767 --> 01:38:14.977
We have to meet once more
before I leave

01:38:15.101 --> 01:38:19.709
'Agree man!
Say yes of course'

01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:22.774
okay

01:38:23.167 --> 01:38:25.204
Okay, see you then

01:38:25.301 --> 01:38:26.974
I'll see you later

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:27.772
Bye

01:38:31.534 --> 01:38:33.138
Take care, okay?

01:38:36.434 --> 01:38:37.606
Go brother

<i>tiff </i>

01:38:57.067 --> 01:38:59.172
There's a wedding the day after

01:38:59.634 --> 01:39:01.375
Day after there's a wedding

01:39:01.434 --> 01:39:04.005
Our undersecretary
Koshy sir's daughter

01:39:04.067 --> 01:39:06.775
Groom lives in Germany
Can't avoid it...what a pain!

01:39:07.234 --> 01:39:09.737
So you're planning
to go to Germany?

01:39:10.634 --> 01:39:13.114
No, the wedding
is in Ernakulum

01:39:13.467 --> 01:39:16.744
I can go tomorrow and
be back day after tomorrow

01:39:17.534 --> 01:39:21.641
Oh God! What a severe headache
Get me some tea

01:39:21.767 --> 01:39:24.179
This pain won't go
with a mere tea

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.440
Hasn't Achu come back?

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:31.242
Its dusk already
Is he still playing?

01:39:31.301 --> 01:39:33.508
People in this house
are playing games in the dark

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.671
They think
nobody understands

01:39:36.067 --> 01:39:37.045
What?

01:39:37.134 --> 01:39:38.636
You go call him if you want

01:39:38.734 --> 01:39:43.114
His father is totally nuts
How else will his kid be?

01:39:43.734 --> 01:39:47.614
Does anyone know why,
when or where you're going?

01:39:47.667 --> 01:39:49.772
Neither do you answer questions

01:39:50.001 --> 01:39:52.038
Only lies come out of your mouth

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.070
When did I lie to you?

01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:56.773
Oh you're not Chandramohan
You are Harishchandran

01:39:57.034 --> 01:39:59.378
You speak only the truth always

01:39:59.534 --> 01:40:01.070
Weren't you on leave today?

01:40:01.134 --> 01:40:03.580
But when I called you said
you were at the office

01:40:05.101 --> 01:40:06.478
Did you go to my office?

01:40:06.534 --> 01:40:09.640
Forget that!
Were you on leave today or not?

01:40:10.567 --> 01:40:12.979
Why are you always
running after me?

01:40:13.134 --> 01:40:15.637
When we lived apart
your calls begin at sharp 6 AM

01:40:15.701 --> 01:40:17.681
Where are you, Chandraetta?

01:40:17.767 --> 01:40:20.338
While I'm walking or eating
or sitting or sleeping

01:40:20.401 --> 01:40:22.074
Always I get your
damn phone call

01:40:22.134 --> 01:40:23.772
Don't you have
any better work?

01:40:24.067 --> 01:40:26.104
After so many years
don't you trust me?

01:40:26.167 --> 01:40:29.239
You think I'm going
to walk out with someone else?

01:40:30.367 --> 01:40:33.246
I thought it would end
if you moved in here

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.210
But what's the use

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:35.677
It's become even more direct

01:40:35.734 --> 01:40:37.077
What are you?
The secret police

01:40:37.133 --> 01:40:39.272
Only those with secrets
have to fear the police

01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:40.711
Look here you...!

01:40:44.567 --> 01:40:45.511
You tell me

01:40:45.567 --> 01:40:48.138
Havel ever
disobeyed you on anytime?

01:40:48.534 --> 01:40:51.413
I get up early, have a bath
and do the pooja

01:40:51.501 --> 01:40:55.472
Whatever the rituals
I do it all every day of the week

01:40:57.501 --> 01:41:00.539
Come here boy!
Playing even after dark

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.342
I've warned you
to come home by six

01:41:04.401 --> 01:41:06.312
What was your math marks?

01:41:06.367 --> 01:41:07.243
8 upon 10

01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:08.143
8 out of...?

01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:10.010
What are you doing?
Stop that

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.309
Are his marks that bad?

01:41:12.467 --> 01:41:14.970
Stop taking out
your anger on him

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.977
His father's already ruined

01:41:17.034 --> 01:41:18.536
Let me see if I can
straighten him out

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.511
- Come here!
- Let go of him!

01:41:23.067 --> 01:41:25.206
You've gone mad
Completely mad

01:41:26.367 --> 01:41:28.677
God! I've had enough

01:41:29.101 --> 01:41:31.047
Frankly! I'm totally fed up

01:41:41.767 --> 01:41:43.041
Mom?

01:41:56.034 --> 01:41:57.104
Sir?
Anything to mix?

01:41:57.201 --> 01:42:00.080
Don't mix anything
It must be pure

01:42:04.067 --> 01:42:05.774
One more double large

01:42:15.667 --> 01:42:17.237
Where is the glass?

01:42:19.234 --> 01:42:20.474
Brother?

01:42:23.567 --> 01:42:26.241
Enough
Why drink like this?

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.209
Malayalam?

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.571
It's been a thousand years

01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:35.245
Not only Malayalam
I speak all languages of India

01:42:39.234 --> 01:42:41.339
You will die if you
drink like this

01:42:42.334 --> 01:42:45.110
Let me die
I've had enough

01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:46.510
Then ask for the bill

01:42:46.567 --> 01:42:47.705
Bill?

01:42:48.234 --> 01:42:51.010
I said I've had
enough of life, not alcohol

01:42:51.067 --> 01:42:52.307
Oh is that so?

01:42:52.368 --> 01:42:54.405
That is so
One large

01:42:57.734 --> 01:42:59.611
If you drink this
then you'll be out

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.509
My case will go for a toss

01:43:01.567 --> 01:43:03.569
I don't have
any peace at home

01:43:03.667 --> 01:43:06.409
At least leave me
in peace at the bar

01:43:06.467 --> 01:43:08.276
Please just leave me alone

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.304
What a pain!

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.177
My dear brother
Anyway you've left home

01:43:14.467 --> 01:43:18.574
Now take a decision regarding
Geethanjali and then return

01:43:19.434 --> 01:43:21.243
That's easy for you to say

01:43:21.601 --> 01:43:25.981
When I think of my Sushu,
I can't do that

01:43:27.567 --> 01:43:31.014
Bro, why are you
talking like this?

01:43:31.101 --> 01:43:35.072
What I couldn't fulfill
in my last incarnation

01:43:35.401 --> 01:43:39.110
Youjust have to do it now
That's all

01:43:39.267 --> 01:43:41.042
What's wrong with that

01:43:41.301 --> 01:43:43.542
You are me, right?

01:43:45.601 --> 01:43:47.080
Then what about me?

01:43:47.134 --> 01:43:48.613
<i>L</i> am you, right?

01:43:51.167 --> 01:43:53.477
Only when you
and Geethanjali unite

01:43:53.534 --> 01:43:56.140
Vasanthamallika and I
will become one

01:43:56.201 --> 01:43:58.010
You will face no problems

01:43:58.134 --> 01:44:03.379
You both have to become one
In both body and spirit

01:44:03.434 --> 01:44:06.381
_ Body?
With my body?

01:44:07.267 --> 01:44:09.474
What else?
With mine?

01:44:09.534 --> 01:44:12.743
I don't have a body
I'm just a spirit here

01:44:13.001 --> 01:44:19.577
Desire alone is not enough
We need a body too

01:44:19.667 --> 01:44:23.046
That won't work out
Please just leave

01:44:23.101 --> 01:44:24.171
Nasty fellow

01:44:24.234 --> 01:44:26.305
Hey Jackass

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:33.116
What do think?!
First fix your last birth

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.771
Then take care of this birth
Understood?

01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:44.541
Sorry brother

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.340
No

01:44:45.434 --> 01:44:47.971
Didn't you hear her say in the car?

01:44:48.467 --> 01:44:49.571
What?

01:44:49.667 --> 01:44:55.174
She said she would give you
anything in return for your help

01:44:56.467 --> 01:45:00.711
Just call her
Go to her house

01:45:02.234 --> 01:45:04.578
You won't get this chance

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:08.671
Go man
It's a ten minute matter

01:45:08.767 --> 01:45:12.044
If you finish this fast
I can leave this earth

01:45:12.134 --> 01:45:14.205
My soul will be released

01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:17.181
Get up, brother

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.772
Brother

01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:20.503
Please get up

01:45:21.268 --> 01:45:22.246
What?

01:45:23.334 --> 01:45:27.043
Tell the truth
Don't you like her?

01:45:31.034 --> 01:45:37.974
You are blushing
you rascal, you sweetie pie

01:45:38.334 --> 01:45:41.042
Call her
Call her

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.774
Sir
Sir?

01:45:45.401 --> 01:45:47.312
What are you doing?

01:45:50.367 --> 01:45:53.143
Sushma'echi is calling over
and over again searching for you

01:45:53.201 --> 01:45:54.646
- Tell her to get lost
- Get lost where?

01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.770
Sir, come with me
Let's go home

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.310
I'm not going
back to my house

01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:02.212
Superb

01:46:03.334 --> 01:46:04.438
One large

No more larges
Come on, let's go home

01:46:06.367 --> 01:46:07.607
You don't decide for me

01:46:07.667 --> 01:46:09.146
Who will pay the bill here?

01:46:09.234 --> 01:46:11.180
- I'll pay it, come
- Arrogant fellow!

01:46:11.267 --> 01:46:13.611
What a lot of wind
What are we travelling on?

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:14.975
The legendary flower chariot

01:46:15.067 --> 01:46:16.410
The flower chariot?

01:46:16.467 --> 01:46:19.073
Don't let the demon Ravana
know you have this

01:46:19.167 --> 01:46:22.307
My dear sir please be quiet
Just let me drop you off

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.108
What am I?
A load to be dropped off?

01:46:25.167 --> 01:46:27.044
Yeah you're a little overloaded

01:46:28.367 --> 01:46:30.677
I told you that day itself
to stop all this

01:46:31.134 --> 01:46:34.013
First you stop it, then I'll
decide if I need stop it or not

01:46:34.067 --> 01:46:36.411
I'm not talking about your drinking
I'm talking about your other matter

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:37.740
- What
-Your 'dance'

01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:38.706
Get lost

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:40.007
Yeah get lost

01:46:43.067 --> 01:46:45.308
Stop ringing the bell
The key is with me

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.038
Where is everyone?

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:48.545
Don't you see me
standing here?

01:46:48.601 --> 01:46:50.205
How the hell did you
come out?

01:46:50.267 --> 01:46:51.177
Go inside, sir

01:46:51.267 --> 01:46:53.008
I'll go inside

01:46:53.067 --> 01:46:53.772
Are you happy now?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.172
Sushma'echi found out
everything now?

01:46:55.267 --> 01:46:56.371
She didn't find out anything

01:46:56.434 --> 01:46:58.436
Then how come
you're not returning home?

01:46:58.501 --> 01:47:00.412
She doesn't give me
any peace of mind

01:47:00.501 --> 01:47:03.345
If I go out I'm at fault
lfl come back, that's also a fault

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.678
Do you know how long it's been
since I sawa dance program in peace?

01:47:07.734 --> 01:47:10.237
Can I drink in peace?

01:47:11.534 --> 01:47:14.014
She took out her anger...

01:47:14.734 --> 01:47:17.578
...by hitting our son

01:47:17.634 --> 01:47:19.204
That's because of love

01:47:19.767 --> 01:47:23.214
Too much love
becomes a nuisance

01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:25.071
Come

01:47:25.701 --> 01:47:28.181
You must learn
from Geethanjali

01:47:28.234 --> 01:47:29.440
Sure, I'll learn

01:47:29.601 --> 01:47:33.674
She pours out
a shot like this

01:47:36.734 --> 01:47:39.010
And I can talk to her
about anything openly

01:47:39.067 --> 01:47:41.638
She's intelligent
and an artist

01:47:43.267 --> 01:47:45.645
What does your
Sushma'echi know?

01:47:45.701 --> 01:47:47.510
Just domestic chores

01:47:47.567 --> 01:47:50.980
If a problem crops up
it's the housewife will be with you

01:47:51.034 --> 01:47:52.707
If something happens
to you, do you think...

01:47:52.767 --> 01:47:54.144
...Geethanjali will stand by you?

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.508
She will just walk off

01:47:55.567 --> 01:47:56.272
Get lost

01:47:56.334 --> 01:47:58.075
- Get lost
- She won't go anywhere

01:47:58.134 --> 01:47:59.135
We will see

01:47:59.234 --> 01:48:02.647
She is my dream
My Vasanthamallika

01:48:03.367 --> 01:48:07.144
A statue I sculpted
with my love

01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:10.613
Don't try to pull a fast one
on me like you do to your wife, okay?

01:48:10.668 --> 01:48:13.080
Fast one on you?
What do you mean?

01:48:14.167 --> 01:48:16.704
Velkuzhukottuvan, I saw him today also

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.371
We were sitting face to face

01:48:19.467 --> 01:48:20.502
And did he drink?

01:48:20.567 --> 01:48:24.572
Drink...of course not!
He was very stressed

01:48:24.634 --> 01:48:27.342
Very tense
But I did see him

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.177
Of course you will
He's the guy sleeping in you

01:48:31.267 --> 01:48:32.439
Hey you?!

01:48:32.534 --> 01:48:34.514
- Did you call me?
- I just touched you

01:48:34.567 --> 01:48:35.238
okay

01:48:35.301 --> 01:48:39.340
Do you think I don't know
this incarnation game you're up to?

01:48:39.467 --> 01:48:44.746
Isn't it a ploy to escape when
your wife comes to know of it all?

01:48:44.801 --> 01:48:46.474
This will not convince me, okay?

01:48:46.534 --> 01:48:47.706
Sushuma!

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.046
- What's your name?
- Sumesh

01:48:51.134 --> 01:48:55.708
Sumesh! All this is wrong
I speak from experience

01:48:55.801 --> 01:49:00.648
Velkuzhu said
Vasanthamallika is my life

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.308
She is mine
Thousand years

01:49:07.467 --> 01:49:11.677
Velkuzhu
Come

01:49:12.467 --> 01:49:16.745
There goes a yawn
Now let me pick you up

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:17.671
Come

01:49:17.734 --> 01:49:21.375
Take me to my palace room
You'll get a slap from me

01:49:21.434 --> 01:49:23.778
She is my mate, Vasanthamallika

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:51.644
Yes?

01:49:53.434 --> 01:49:56.677
Who are you?
There is no consultation here

01:49:57.567 --> 01:49:59.171
lam not ill

01:50:03.034 --> 01:50:05.036
Hey! Who are you?

01:50:08.067 --> 01:50:10.604
Tell me
Who are you?

01:50:11.701 --> 01:50:14.409
I am Sushma
Chandramohan's wife

01:50:17.267 --> 01:50:20.043
Why are you running
after my husband?

01:50:21.334 --> 01:50:26.079
Marriage is not like
a dance performance

01:50:26.467 --> 01:50:29.607
Dancers don a different role
and dance on each stage

01:50:29.667 --> 01:50:34.343
But a wife can't do that
She has only one role in life

01:50:34.401 --> 01:50:40.147
To continue that role she needs
her husband's love and trust

01:50:42.567 --> 01:50:44.240
But I have lost all that

01:50:45.801 --> 01:50:48.475
And you are
the sole reason for that

01:50:51.334 --> 01:50:56.716
lam a dancer and I can easily lie
saying I have no relationship...

01:50:56.767 --> 01:50:58.405
with Chandramohan

01:50:59.634 --> 01:51:01.375
But I refuse to say anything

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.343
Who are you to him?
Friend...Lover...or wife?

01:51:09.167 --> 01:51:11.511
- I don't know
- But I do

01:51:11.568 --> 01:51:14.549
Hereafter if you continue
pursuing my husband...!

01:51:27.234 --> 01:51:31.376
It's him, but I won't
answer that call in front of you

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.543
I am the reason for this mess
Only me

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:57.213
He is not seeing you as Geethanjali

01:51:57.267 --> 01:51:58.746
Instead you are
his Vasanthamallika

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.139
Who is Vasanthamallika?

01:52:01.767 --> 01:52:03.769
Velkozhukottuvan's lover

01:52:04.267 --> 01:52:05.337
Velkozhu...?

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.176
A court poet in king
Raja Raja Chozha's kingdom

01:52:09.034 --> 01:52:11.708
What the heck are you saying?
I don't understand a thing!

01:52:11.767 --> 01:52:13.212
Have you gone mad?

01:52:15.401 --> 01:52:16.709
It's fate

01:52:17.334 --> 01:52:20.281
I was destined to read
sage Agasthyar's writings

01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:24.211
Otherwise, how was I, from Thrissur
urged to go to Vaitheeshwarar temple?

01:52:53.767 --> 01:52:56.338
You are going to Germany
tomorrow, right?

01:52:56.534 --> 01:52:59.777
I know that today, Chandra'ettan
will come here to bid you goodbye

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.506
if he comes into this house
then, it's you who'll live together

01:53:06.467 --> 01:53:08.970
My son and I will
not stand your way

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:14.977
But if he does not...then
never come into our lives again

01:53:17.134 --> 01:53:18.374
Now attend that call

01:54:00.267 --> 01:54:02.406
Some fireworks
in here will be apt

01:54:03.367 --> 01:54:05.040
Can you please switch it off?

01:54:05.101 --> 01:54:06.273
Switch off the engine?

01:54:06.334 --> 01:54:07.506
No, these lights

01:54:07.567 --> 01:54:10.047
I can't do that
The vehicle will stop

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:10.703
Why?

01:54:10.768 --> 01:54:12.338
Both have the same connection

01:54:12.401 --> 01:54:15.678
I feel like a saint
carried in a glass case

01:54:16.534 --> 01:54:19.242
You appear
to prefer darkness, right?

01:54:33.634 --> 01:54:38.174
"Oh my Julie, Julie"

01:54:38.234 --> 01:54:44.185
"How many strings
does your guitar have?"

01:54:44.234 --> 01:54:48.979
"One and only one"

01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:53.680
"Oh my Julie, Julie"

01:54:53.801 --> 01:54:59.376
"How many strings
does your guitar have?"

01:54:59.434 --> 01:55:01.414
Hey! Can you
stop this music?

01:55:01.534 --> 01:55:03.741
It's our great
Devarajan sir's music

01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:07.210
Whosever, the lyrics
seem to be a little weird?

01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:09.975
Why do you want
to read between lines?

01:55:10.068 --> 01:55:12.070
Just take it at face value, sir

01:55:27.467 --> 01:55:28.377
You can stop here

01:55:28.434 --> 01:55:30.641
- Here?
-A little further

01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.576
okay

01:55:34.734 --> 01:55:36.042
Stop here

01:55:38.067 --> 01:55:39.444
Okay
Keep the change

01:55:39.501 --> 01:55:41.276
Lovely perfume

01:56:20.801 --> 01:56:24.305
God!

01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:14.244
Just go!

01:57:32.568 --> 01:57:35.139
Don't cry, baby
Don't cry

01:57:38.234 --> 01:57:39.611
Don't cry, dear

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.536
Where are you' Chandra'etta?

01:59:57.601 --> 02:00:00.775
I'm on my way back home

02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:03.171
Didn't you go
for the wedding?

02:00:03.234 --> 02:00:06.374
No, I did not go

02:00:18.567 --> 02:00:25.485
"Like the cool rain drops within the heart"

02:00:26.067 --> 02:00:32.712
"Droplets of rain that fell into the heart"

02:00:33.367 --> 02:00:36.780
"Like the smile that evoked thrills so sweet"

02:00:37.101 --> 02:00:40.674
"Like the caress of a tender leaf by a breeze"

02:00:54.267 --> 02:00:57.111
'Chandran(moon) loves
only one person'

02:00:57.167 --> 02:00:58.703
'And that is Rohini
(star/Aldebaran)'

02:00:59.001 --> 02:01:03.416
'His life is a long journey
to reach her'

02:01:03.601 --> 02:01:06.741
'The day he reaches her
he becomes complete'

02:01:07.434 --> 02:01:09.311
'That day will be
a full moon day'

02:01:23.134 --> 02:01:24.169
Chandramohan?

02:01:24.234 --> 02:01:27.215
Call George and ask him
to arrange for that function

02:01:27.267 --> 02:01:28.337
Okay sir

02:01:39.667 --> 02:01:41.977
Call her man
Call Vasanthamallika

02:01:43.067 --> 02:01:45.638
You are Velkuzhukottuvan dude

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:46.678
Get lost!

02:02:05.167 --> 02:02:06.168
Sushu?

02:02:06.267 --> 02:02:07.769
Where are you Chandra'etta?

02:02:08.001 --> 02:02:11.312
I am in office
happily going for lunch

02:02:15.767 --> 02:02:23.652
"A fragrance who fills my heart
Be with me, lovely as spring forever"

02:02:23.734 --> 02:02:32.518
"Sweet like the tinkle gold anklets,
dancer divine, be only mine"

02:02:39.134 --> 02:02:47.053
"Amillion poems awaken
just looking at you"

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:55.076
"In your dance footsteps
beats my life's rhythm in tune"

02:02:55.134 --> 02:03:03.144
"Your sweetness make me swoon
I remain a poet besotted with you"

02:03:03.201 --> 02:03:11.746
"Come to me, my lover"

02:03:12.034 --> 02:03:19.612
"A fragrance who fills my heart
Be with me, lovely as spring forever"

02:03:19.667 --> 02:03:27.643
"Sweet like the tinkle gold anklets,
dancer divine, be only mine"
