WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.880
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.963 --> 00:08.091
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.175 --> 00:11.845
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.929 --> 00:14.515
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.101
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.227 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:24.983
Laugh and cry

00:25.067 --> 00:29.988
He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:35.160 --> 00:38.789
Coming up, a New Orleans man
says his socks are finally dry.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.166
But first, the big news
in entertainment this week

00:41.250 --> 00:43.544
is the lovable child actress,
Olivia Fuller.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.379
Oh, my God, Brian,
that's Olivia

00:45.462 --> 00:46.630
from the performing
arts school.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.173
What sort of
overblown contract

00:48.257 --> 00:50.425
has that dreadful
bitch landed now?

00:50.509 --> 00:51.927
Most of you know Olivia

00:52.010 --> 00:53.136
as the adorable
little girl

00:53.220 --> 00:54.388
in the Tasty Juice ads.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.431
Hey, Mom, can I
have some soda?

00:56.515 --> 00:59.017
No, but you can have
some Tasty Juice.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.061
It has only one-third
the sugar of soda.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.146
Mmm. Delicious.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.231
Thanks, Mom.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.281
But little Olivia's career
may be over just as it begins

01:12.364 --> 01:15.158
with today's announcement that
Tasty Juice will be dropping her

01:15.242 --> 01:17.077
as their spokesperson
and replacing her

01:17.160 --> 01:18.954
with a new ad
campaign featuring

01:19.037 --> 01:20.706
rock and roll legend
Chuck Berry.

01:20.789 --> 01:24.001
Open your mouth, baby,
here it comes.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.378
But there is a silver lining
for local Quahogians,

01:26.461 --> 01:29.089
as Miss Fuller will be appearing
at the Quahog mall this weekend

01:29.173 --> 01:30.591
to mark the grand opening

01:30.674 --> 01:33.010
of the new Brat Wraps Kids
Clothing store.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.219
Oh, that's perfect.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.054
Brian, we have to go
down there this weekend

01:36.138 --> 01:37.764
and heckle her roundly.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.267
I'll humiliate her worse
than Luke Skywalker did

01:40.350 --> 01:41.560
to that Rebel pilot.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.480
The exhaust shaft is only
two meters wide,

01:45.564 --> 01:47.608
so you'll have to use
proton torpedoes.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.401
Well, that's impossible.
Even for a computer.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.777
It's not impossible.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.113
I used to bull's-eye wamprats
in my T-16 back home.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.574
They're not much bigger
than two meters.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.161
Hey, uh, can-can I talk to
you privately for a second?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.245
Sure.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.957
Th-that, that, uh, that
was, that was unnecessary.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.083
What's the problem?

02:05.167 --> 02:06.752
Well, you-you just
kind of called me out

02:06.835 --> 02:08.295
in front of everybody
back there...

02:08.378 --> 02:10.422
-I was just making a point.
-I know, I know,

02:10.506 --> 02:12.299
but you like just kind of
sandbagged me in front

02:12.382 --> 02:14.176
-of everyone we know. Oh, oh,
-I sandbagged you?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.302
In front of all of
our friends, yeah,

02:15.385 --> 02:16.428
you sandbagged me.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.846
I sandbagged you.
You sandbagged me, yes.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.306
Well, here I am trying
to help you with something...

02:19.389 --> 02:20.766
You know what, you know
what, you know what,

02:20.849 --> 02:22.309
I don't need your kind
of help, all right?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.602
Have a great assault.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.895
Jerk.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.949
Lois, I don't understand
why I got to sit through

02:37.032 --> 02:38.116
a chick flick.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.451
Peter, you promised
you'd come with me

02:39.535 --> 02:41.078
to see Autumn's Piano.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.664
Besides, you owe me big after
the way you embarrassed me

02:43.747 --> 02:44.831
in front of Sandra Oh.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.126
Oh, my God,
Sandra Oh.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.088
-We loved you in Sideways.
-Thank you.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.132
We see you in many movies.

02:54.216 --> 02:58.136
I think about you
while having sex with my wife.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.639
I thank you with one dollar.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.015
That's a lot of money to them.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.517
Lois, I'm just warning you,

03:03.600 --> 03:04.893
if this movie turns me gay,

03:04.977 --> 03:06.520
I'm going to start
bringing gay guys home.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.063
And I don't mean the
classy "maybe they are,

03:08.146 --> 03:09.356
maybe they're not"
gay guys.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.899
I mean those big,
"Oh, my God,

03:10.983 --> 03:11.984
"here they come,
floatin' around,

03:12.067 --> 03:13.068
making noise" gay guys,

03:13.151 --> 03:14.653
not the "fix up
your house" gay guys.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.572
Peter, shh,
it's starting.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.660
You must be Autumn Daniels.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.537
welcome to Barncliffe
school for girls.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.372
We're your roommates: I'm Sassy,

03:25.455 --> 03:27.875
that's Pouty,
and this is Suicidy.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.335
I got a bad feeling
about Suicidy.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.630
Ain't no mountain
high enough

03:33.714 --> 03:35.883
(laughing) Yeah!

03:35.966 --> 03:37.968
You can tell all the girls
care about each other,

03:38.051 --> 03:40.470
'cause they have so much
fun cleaning the dishes.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.972
AUTUMN:
I have to leave,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.433
and I'm taking my piano with me.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.769
No...! Why?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.062
Why?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.274
She chose the piano
over her insulin.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.651
You could've had both.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.738
(crying)

03:59.740 --> 04:03.160
(crying)

04:03.243 --> 04:04.828
See? That wasn't so bad.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.163
Oh, you know, Lois,

04:06.246 --> 04:09.124
this movie has helped me
understand a lot of things.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.918
Like that foreign
guy at work

04:11.001 --> 04:12.711
who helped me
understand sarcasm.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
Huh, nice day
we're having.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.798
-Oh, ho-ho! Yes!
-What?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.509
He say "Nice day,"

04:18.592 --> 04:20.511
-but he covered with rain.
-So?

04:20.594 --> 04:24.806
So, he say this when your brain
know is not really nice day.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.850
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Ha-ha. Yes.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.685
He say the opposite.
Is funny.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.062
Oh, yeah, I get it.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.147
-"Nice day."
-Oh, ho ho.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.107
Now you funny, too.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.400
Oh...

04:40.447 --> 04:41.615
There she is, Brian.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.700
Oh, boy, I am going to
take her down right

04:43.784 --> 04:44.910
in front of everybody.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.745
All right, Olivia,
get ready to...

04:46.828 --> 04:48.705
-Good Lord.
-What is it?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.040
Brian, she looks...

04:50.123 --> 04:51.959
she looks fantastic.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.629
And now TV's Olivia Fuller
will cut the ceremonial ribbon.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.172
I hope I'm allowed to do this.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.216
My mommy says,
"Don't run with scissors."

04:59.299 --> 05:01.051
(laughing)
She's so cute.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.011
I love children.
Look at my kids.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.306
So everyone feel free to browse

05:06.390 --> 05:08.058
and purchase
from our fine selection.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.061
Hey, Mom, now would be a good
time to raise my allowance.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.563
(laughing)

05:16.942 --> 05:18.485
Oh, this one's
kind of nice.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.487
Wha...?
Olivia!

05:20.571 --> 05:22.030
Hey...!

05:22.114 --> 05:24.157
Stewie?
Oh, my God.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.702
Wow, this is--
it's been a while.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.495
Yeah, no, it has.

05:28.579 --> 05:29.997
Uh, what, so-so
you back in town?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.790
Yeah, we're, um, uh,

05:31.874 --> 05:33.500
we're moving back
into the old house.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.211
Oh, that's, wow-- God,
y-you look great, I mean,

05:36.295 --> 05:38.463
y-you're all, you're
all in shape.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.424
My God, California's
been good to you.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.759
I mean, I guess, I guess
you should be looking good

05:42.843 --> 05:44.720
'cause everybody's a health
nut out there, right?

05:44.803 --> 05:46.597
(both laughing)

05:46.680 --> 05:47.931
Yeah.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.143
Well, anyway, it was
nice seeing you again,

05:51.226 --> 05:52.978
-so... You t-- Hey,
-uh, listen, um,

05:53.103 --> 05:55.063
maybe you want to
come over on Friday,

05:55.147 --> 05:56.815
it's, it's my
"Bernie Mac" night.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.859
Um, i-it's a fun show if
you haven't seen it.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.069
I-I can't understand what
the devil he's saying,

06:01.153 --> 06:03.113
but you know, there's,
there's a lot of movement,

06:03.197 --> 06:04.448
and it-it's bright
and colorful,

06:04.531 --> 06:05.657
it keeps my attention.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.659
Look, Stewie,
you're sweet,

06:07.743 --> 06:09.077
but since I moved
to Hollywood,

06:09.161 --> 06:10.537
I've done a lot
of growing up.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.207
I'm dating more
sophisticated men now.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.334
But it was good
to see you.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.669
What happened?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.546
She shot me down, Brian.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.631
What do you care?

06:20.714 --> 06:21.757
You came here to gloat

06:21.840 --> 06:23.008
about her contract
cancellation anyway.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.636
Yes, but that was before
I got a look at her face.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.721
I mean, she's a woman
now, Brian.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.389
So sophisticated,
so grown up,

06:29.473 --> 06:31.725
and she says
she wants a grown-up man.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.228
But, apparently,
that's not me.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.646
Ya think so?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.314
(boing)
(laugh track)

06:37.397 --> 06:38.482
(laughing)

06:38.607 --> 06:40.025
Who could forget that one?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.777

07:22.568 --> 07:24.194

Hear what '80s mainstay Howard
Hesseman has to say about it.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.073
I love it.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.158
Would Howard Hesseman lie
for weed?

07:30.242 --> 07:32.369
We don't think so. Order now.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.334
There we go.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.420
You are ready for your date.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.047
Yeah, that's a bed head.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.675
Yeah, hey, look at you,
you just got out of bed.

07:46.758 --> 07:50.012
You're the underachiever every
woman wants to sleep with.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.346
Hey, big date tonight?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.556
Uh, yeah, yeah.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.141
Hey, listen, I'm, uh,

07:54.224 --> 07:55.851
sorry about Olivia
rejecting you.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.477
Oh, I haven't given
up yet, Brian.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.688
She says she wants a more
mature, grown-up man,

07:59.771 --> 08:01.899
so all I've got to do
is be more grown-up.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.484
-What are you doing? Just cleanin' out
-your brush, man.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.572
(doorbell rings)

08:10.449 --> 08:11.450
Hi, Jillian.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.493
Hi, Brian, ready to go?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.287
Hey, baby.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.622
Hi, Stewie.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.915
What the hell are you doing?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.208
Eh, not much, really.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.169
Just me and my pubes,
ha...ngin' out.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.295
Oh, dear God.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.588
Boy, I am so beat

08:24.671 --> 08:26.340
from doing adult stuff all day.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.758
So am I.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.260
I, just kind of feel like
kickin' it tonight.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.054
Oh, look at that.
I'm growing all the time.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.681
-Hey, uh, Jillian, can you give
-me a minute?

08:34.765 --> 08:38.018
You ever just let
your balls hang out, B-Ri?

08:38.101 --> 08:41.063
You ever do that,
B-Roney?

08:41.146 --> 08:43.690
Drove my Chevy to the levee,
but the levee was Bri?

08:43.774 --> 08:44.900
Give me my hair back.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.068
Ow! What the hell, man.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.945
Stewie, this is not
going to convince Olivia

08:48.028 --> 08:49.488
that you're grown-up
enough for her.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.031
Oh, yeah, what do you
know about women?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.658
You want to know
how to get women?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.494
There's only one place
in town you need to observe.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.578
Just watch.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.497
I am not doing
that, Glenn.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.207
Come on, beautiful,
keep an open mind.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.959
You're a sick man.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.919
Hey, keep it down.
I don't want my neighbors

09:04.002 --> 09:05.754
seeing a fat, old,
dirty whore screaming at me

09:05.838 --> 09:08.006
on my front lawn.
Whore?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.591
Well, maybe I
should come inside.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.343
Well, maybe you should.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.761
What the deuce?

09:12.845 --> 09:14.513
Why the hell would
she respond positively

09:14.596 --> 09:15.806
to such a negative comment?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.391
Unless...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.268
Brian, do women like it

09:19.351 --> 09:20.602
when you treat
them like crap?

09:20.686 --> 09:21.937
Well, I-I don't know
if you want to be

09:22.020 --> 09:23.021
that black-and-white
about it.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.231
That's it, isn't it?

09:24.314 --> 09:26.859
Women respond when you treat
them like crap.

09:26.942 --> 09:31.613
Well, Olivia, prepare to meet
a much darker Stewie Griffin.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.786
Hey, babe.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.621
What do you say,
we going out Saturday night?

09:39.705 --> 09:41.206
Stewie, what are
you doing here?

09:41.290 --> 09:43.792
I told you, I'm just into
a different type of guy.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.544
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you
what you're into.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.796
Being ugly.
Stewie, you're being mean.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.131
No. If I was being mean,

09:49.214 --> 09:50.924
when you opened the door
I would have said,

09:51.008 --> 09:53.343
"Oh, hey, Ray Liotta,
is Olivia home?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.053
Oh, wait, you're Olivia."

09:55.137 --> 09:56.847
You see, I thought
you were Ray Liotta

09:56.930 --> 09:58.056
because your skin
has the texture

09:58.140 --> 10:00.184
of a decorative
autumn squash.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.519
(crying)

10:02.603 --> 10:04.980
So, I'll pick you up
at 7:00?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.441
That sounds wonderful.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.942
She said yes.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.695
My God, I'm cooler than that
cheetah from the commercials.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.864
(Rush's "Tom Sawyer" playing)

10:16.950 --> 10:18.493
(grunts)

10:18.577 --> 10:23.957
Oh, God, there is no (bleeping)
drummer better than Neil Peart!

10:24.041 --> 10:26.710
It ain't easy bein' cheesy.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.048
Oh Smilla,

10:31.131 --> 10:34.927
your sense of snow is equaled
only by your sense of love.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.428
Peter, have you
been up all night

10:36.512 --> 10:37.888
watching chick movies?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.057
Lois, before I found
these movies,

10:40.140 --> 10:41.975
women only made me cry
through my penis.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.019
Now they make me cry
through my eyes.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.187
I've decided.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.231
I'm making my own chick flick.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.524
What? You don't
know anything

10:48.607 --> 10:50.067
about making movies.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.945
Are you kidding? I got lots of
experience in the film industry.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.655
I was the original
"Pretty Woman."

10:54.738 --> 10:57.241
You look beautiful,
but there's something missing.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.661
(cackling laughter)

11:02.704 --> 11:04.706
This is a beautiful
spot, Stewie.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.625
I know. I love coming
here because you can just

11:06.708 --> 11:08.710
sit here
and people-watch, you know?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.045
Oh, oh, look at this.
Look at this guy.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.797
-Look at this. Wha-What is that?
-What is he doing?

11:11.880 --> 11:14.091
Just standing there
sm-smelling his hand?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.593
(laughs)
"Wha-What is that?

11:16.677 --> 11:17.970
"What is that
on my hand?

11:18.053 --> 11:20.138
"Is that... is that
barbecue sauce?

11:20.222 --> 11:22.266
When was I near
barbecue sauce?"

11:22.349 --> 11:25.269
-(laughs): Oh, look, look!
-Jewish cowboy!

11:25.352 --> 11:26.979
Jewish cowboy!
Yeah.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.063
Not gonna be so
tough when

11:28.146 --> 11:29.606
the sun goes
down, are you?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.066
(both laugh)

11:31.149 --> 11:32.901
Better go rassle up
some Chinese food,

11:32.985 --> 11:34.361
Hopalong Nussbaum.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.321
(both laugh)

11:36.405 --> 11:38.365
You know, Stewie,
I'm really glad

11:38.448 --> 11:39.616
I gave you
another chance.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.952
-You're a really special guy.
-I know.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.872
No, no, I'm kidding--
I'm not really

11:44.955 --> 11:46.748
that self-centered,
but, you know, Olivia,

11:46.832 --> 11:49.126
I can't think
of anyplace I'd rather be

11:49.209 --> 11:51.503
than right here,
right now with you.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.922
Oh, look at this guy.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.175
Now, there's someone
who cuts his own hair.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.343
Yeah, no kidding.
Oh, my God.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, check
out this uptight

12:00.053 --> 12:01.263
Asian guy,
look at that.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.849
I work really hard,
'cause I'm no fun.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.058
(imitates gong)

12:05.142 --> 12:06.935
(laughing)

12:10.063 --> 12:11.940
Boy, this is-- this
is a great city.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.650
I don't care what
anybody says.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.402
I know. Look
at that sunset

12:15.485 --> 12:16.737
against the skyline.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.071
I know. Wow,
look at that.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.282
A perfect end
to a perfect day.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.910
Yeah. Well, we should
probably get home.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.995
This area gets really
dangerous at night.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.042
(metal clanking, roaring)

12:34.588 --> 12:36.465
Okay, everyone, welcome
to the first day

12:36.548 --> 12:38.383
of shooting for Steel Vaginas.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.969
Peter, this movie doesn't
seem to make any sense.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.596
It makes perfect sense, Lois.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.307
This the scene where
our heroine, Vageena Hertz,

12:45.390 --> 12:47.184
is told by Dr. McNugget here

12:47.267 --> 12:48.977
that she has
uncurable chick cancer.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.522
-All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair
-and shoot this thing.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.398
Peter, I can't lose
the wheelchair.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.650
I need it to move.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.360
Okay, yeah, but your
character can walk.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.862
Peter, I'm handicapped.
I can't walk.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.531
Okay, Chris, roll film.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.115
And... action!

13:03.450 --> 13:05.077
Joe, get out of
the damn chair.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.703
Chris, get the
cattle prod.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.247
(zaps)
(screams)

13:08.330 --> 13:09.873
Okay, now give him
some peanut butter

13:09.957 --> 13:11.375
so we can make it
look like he's talking.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.797
God, I hate
these things.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.590
Sweetie, can't you
just have a good time?

13:18.674 --> 13:20.843
-I don't know anybody. These are
-all your friends.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.136
Just relax. Have some
cake or something.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.014
Hey, hey, who do
we have here?

13:26.098 --> 13:28.308
Oh, my God! Victor?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.394
Hey, kiddo,
how are you?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.563
Great! Great! Wow!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.189
Stewie, this is Victor.

13:34.273 --> 13:36.358
We did a Flintstones vitamins
commercial together.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.695
-BOTH: Ten million strong
-and growing!

13:39.778 --> 13:42.239
Oh, yeah, good to-
good to meet you.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.199
How are you?
Victor's such a good actor.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.451
He played a dead baby
on CSI: Miami.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.078
Yeah, I-I'm more
into writing now.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.998
Oh, hang on a sec.
Uh, idea for a short story:

13:51.081 --> 13:52.624
guy picks his nose,
then eats it.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.835
Yeah, good luck with that.
Uh, hey, uh, Olivia,

13:54.918 --> 13:56.628
why don't you and I
go get some punch?

13:56.712 --> 13:58.672
Oh, actually,
would you mind getting some

13:58.755 --> 14:00.257
for Victor and me
while we catch up?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.759
Or-or a third option.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.012
-Why doesn't Victor go get some punch
-for you and me?

14:05.095 --> 14:06.513
Or maybe you and I
could go away

14:06.597 --> 14:08.223
from Victor and
go get the punch?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.433
Or-or none of us
could have punch.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.809
But still Victor
could go away.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.769
Victor, would you
excuse us for a second?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.980
Uh, sure.
Idea for a novel:

14:15.105 --> 14:16.607
guy loses
his favorite blankie,

14:16.732 --> 14:18.734
goes looking for it
and finds it in the kitchen.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.277
Is that--
I amaze myself.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.446
Is that-- I-It's genius.
It's unbelievable.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.655
I don't know
where I get it from.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.157
What the hell
is wrong with you?

14:25.240 --> 14:28.076
You're acting like a jerk.
Oh, I'm acting like a jerk?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.745
What about Phony Curtis
over there?

14:29.828 --> 14:33.040
He happens to be
a very intelligent, successful actor.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.751
And, you know, he's
done three national diaper commercials.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.169
Yeah, let's put a
diaper on his face.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.755
That's where the
crap is coming out. You don't own me.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.340
I can talk
to whoever I want.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.133
I don't see a ring
on my finger.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.302
(wedding bells ringing)

14:45.385 --> 14:47.513
I, Stewie, take
you, Olivia,

14:47.596 --> 14:49.264
to be my lawfully
wedded wife.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.349
Uh, what's
that, Rupert?

14:50.474 --> 14:51.892
Oh, oh, kiss the
bride. Yes.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.603
(congregation oohs)

15:00.651 --> 15:02.194
Hi, honey! I'm home!

15:02.277 --> 15:03.779
Hi, sweetie, how
was your day?

15:03.862 --> 15:05.572
Well, I was an astronaut
for a while,

15:05.656 --> 15:07.533
then I was a cowboy,
and then all afternoon

15:07.616 --> 15:09.284
I was a fireman,
so it's been, uh...

15:09.368 --> 15:10.494
it's been a long one.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.954
Uh, what's for dinner?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.664
Playdoh spaghetti.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.666
Oh.
What?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.125
No. No, I-It's nothing.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.837
Just had Playdoh
spaghetti last night.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.755
And that's all
we had last night.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.048
What does that mean?

15:23.131 --> 15:24.424
Oh, I don't know,
Olivia. Uh, maybe

15:24.508 --> 15:26.677
that we are
in a sexless marriage.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.095
We have yet
to have sex.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.138
Do you even know
what sex is?

15:30.222 --> 15:31.890
That's not the poi--
Don't change the--

15:31.974 --> 15:33.976
-It's a kind of cake? Look, can we
-just drop this

15:34.059 --> 15:36.186
-and have a normal pretend dinner?
-Fine, fine!

15:36.270 --> 15:38.063
Uch, some days
I think it was easier

15:38.146 --> 15:39.273
being Q-Bert's roommate.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.151
God, it's all night
with this guy.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.028
Hey, if you're gonna leave
all those lights on,

15:45.112 --> 15:46.780
I'm not gonna split
the electric bill.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.246
-(sighs): Sorry we're
-late, everyone,

15:54.329 --> 15:56.999
but JonBenet here took
forever with her makeup.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.501
Uh, yes, and we
probably would've shaved

15:59.585 --> 16:01.795
a few minutes off our trip,
but Mr. Cheapo here

16:01.879 --> 16:03.755
refused to let the valet
touch his Big Wheel,

16:03.839 --> 16:05.591
so we had to drive
around the block six times

16:05.674 --> 16:07.009
till we could
find a spot.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.386
-But to his credit, it is a great spot
-to get mugged.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.763
Oh, wouldn't that
be a shame, if they took all my money

16:11.847 --> 16:13.056
out of both
our wallets.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.892
Well, it's just good
to have you guys here.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.351
Can I get you folks
something to drink?

16:16.435 --> 16:18.145
Uh, yes, I'll just
have flat water.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.647
Um, do you have
Hi-C Tropical Punch?

16:20.731 --> 16:22.482
And it begins...

16:22.566 --> 16:24.276
What? I can't have
a drink with dinner?

16:24.359 --> 16:26.820
-Oh, so dinner started at 2:00 this
-afternoon, did it?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.113
Yes, about the same time

16:28.197 --> 16:29.823
you decided to hole up
in the bathroom

16:29.907 --> 16:31.617
for three hours
waxing your eyebrows.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.910
You swore you
would never--

16:32.993 --> 16:34.203
I have a
prominent brow,

16:34.286 --> 16:36.163
and I do what I
can to get by.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.540
-Well, hey, what's important
-is that you're here now.

16:38.624 --> 16:39.791
Let's just enjoy dinner.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.877
Yeah, can't we just
have a good time?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.545
Uh, ask Olivia.
Olivia, the three of us

16:43.629 --> 16:45.047
are having a great time.
What's your problem?

16:45.130 --> 16:46.798
My problem is you.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.175
You're acting like a baby.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.177
And we come
to the center

16:50.260 --> 16:51.428
of the shrubbery maze.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.472
That's what it all
comes down to, isn't it?

16:53.555 --> 16:55.349
I'm not grown up
enough for you.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.017
Well, you are a
baby, aren't you?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.435
Stay out of it.
Stay out of it.

16:58.519 --> 16:59.686
Well, if you
think I'm a baby,

16:59.770 --> 17:01.688
then perhaps I should
act like a baby.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.525
Waaaah! Waaaah!
Waaaah!

17:04.608 --> 17:06.318
-MAN: Hey, could you
-keep that kid quiet?

17:06.401 --> 17:07.945
Oh, oh, oh,
what's that?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.238
What's that, sir?
What's that?

17:09.321 --> 17:11.114
I-I'm sorry, am I
being too loud for you?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.950
You wanna come
over here and quiet me down?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.284
Oh, let's
not do this.

17:14.368 --> 17:15.869
Oh, God.
Stewie, come on.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.454
I'm scared.
No, it's okay. It's okay.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.957
-Sir? You feel strong? You wanna
-come over here?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.000
-MAN: No, I want to stay here
-and have my steak.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.168
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.586
-What is that, the porterhouse?
-Yeah.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.004
How is it?
What do you care?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.548
If we weren't fighting,
would you recommend it?

17:27.631 --> 17:28.632
Yeah, I would.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.218
(singsongy): Well, I know
what I'm getting.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.765
Hello, everyone.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.643
Well, here we are--
opening night.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.228
You know, somebody once told me

17:41.311 --> 17:42.813
that making movies was easy.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.064
Yeah. Yeah, you know
what else is easy?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.649
Open heart surgery.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.276
MAN:
Oh-ho-ho! Yes!

17:47.359 --> 17:48.569
Yeah, th-thanks
for coming, Fuad.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.029
Oh! Is funny because
open heart surgery

17:51.113 --> 17:52.823
not easy at all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.908
Calm down, Fuad.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.702
So, without further dudes, ah,

17:56.785 --> 17:59.204
-let's, uh, watch this thing. FUAD:
-Oh-ho-ho.

18:00.873 --> 18:03.876
-PETER: At first I didn't believe
-in women and unicorns,

18:04.001 --> 18:07.588
but that was before I knew
about the power of chick stuff,

18:07.671 --> 18:10.507
and before I knew
Vageena Hertz.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.092
(thuds)
CLEVELAND: Sorry.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.178
When Vageena was first born,

18:14.261 --> 18:17.264
I had a small heart
and a lot to learn.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.724
Push, honey!
Hurry up

18:18.807 --> 18:20.392
and give me
my baby boy!

18:20.475 --> 18:21.977
(squishing)

18:22.060 --> 18:24.062
-(whispering): Cleveland, more
-Spaghetti-O's.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.107
Oh, good, a baby.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.984
Oh, no, it's a girl.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.527
And I hate girls.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.821
But one day,
Vageena went swimming

18:32.905 --> 18:35.073
too soon after eating
a sandwich...

18:35.157 --> 18:36.617
and this happened.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.328
Help! Help! I'm drowning!

18:39.411 --> 18:40.871
(coughing):
Help!

18:40.996 --> 18:43.916
We gotta get this woman
to surgery time.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.292
Right stat now!

18:45.375 --> 18:47.044
But it was too late.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.922
And she died
from an angry hymen.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.673
Fin.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.133
-(weak applause) Wow, that was
-the worst

18:53.217 --> 18:54.510
piece of crap
I've ever seen.

18:54.593 --> 18:55.886
Oh, horrible.
Oh, my God,

18:55.969 --> 18:57.054
that was an
abomination.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.347
That was awful.
Awful.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.349
Awful, awful.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.601
My ass is actually sore.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.523
Hey, where's Olivia?

19:07.606 --> 19:09.566
Oh, she's probably
up at the house.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.360
Stewie?
Yeah?

19:11.443 --> 19:13.487
-It's not your fault.
-What?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.072
It's not your fault.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.156
I know.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.491
It's not your fault.

19:17.574 --> 19:18.867
I know.

19:18.951 --> 19:21.620
No, Stewie, Stewie.
It's not your fault.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.038
Don't do this
to me, man.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.957
Not you, man.
It's not your fault.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.625
Screw you!
Cut it out, man!

19:26.708 --> 19:28.001
It's not your fault.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.629
(crying):
Why is it so hard?

19:30.712 --> 19:33.048
I didn't know it was
gonna be so hard.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.800
(crying)

19:34.883 --> 19:37.052
Look, Stewie, you
stood up before God

19:37.177 --> 19:38.929
and all your toys
and you took an oath

19:39.012 --> 19:40.597
to stick it out when
things got tough.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.391
You want her to see
you as an adult?

19:42.474 --> 19:43.809
Well, this is adulthood.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.060
You're right, Brian.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.979
I can't hide
from this relationship.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.064
It's my responsibility
to deal with it.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.066
I mean, what kind
of a man would I be

19:51.149 --> 19:52.693
if I ran off now?

19:52.776 --> 19:54.152
Well, you'd be
a black man.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.029
Wow! Wow!

19:56.113 --> 19:57.281
Whoa, what was that?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.782
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:58.866 --> 19:59.950
That was my
father talking.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.493
You, uh...

20:01.577 --> 20:03.453
you gotta work
on that, man.

20:03.537 --> 20:04.872
Bad dog.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.417
Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I...

20:08.500 --> 20:10.961
(all gasping)
Oh, Stewie! I-I thought

20:11.044 --> 20:12.796
you were at Chuck E. Cheese
with your mom.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.757
No. A four-year-old died
in the ball pit.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.134
We had to cancel.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.178
Is that the Silly Putty
I bought you this weekend?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.180
Stewie, this isn't
what it looks like.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.223
Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie,
I-I just dropped by to...

20:23.307 --> 20:25.851
Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody
talking to you.

20:25.934 --> 20:29.646
Is... that
the Silly Putty...

20:29.730 --> 20:31.940
I bought you
this weekend?

20:32.024 --> 20:33.025
I, you know,
I-I'm really,

20:33.108 --> 20:35.110
I'm sensing something
here, that, uh...

20:35.194 --> 20:37.237
-I-I should be going. No, how about you
-stay here

20:37.321 --> 20:38.947
and I leave and never
come back again?

20:39.031 --> 20:41.909
Stewie, this isn't
how I wanted it to end.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.535
But you did
want it to end.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.579
You've made
that perfectly clear.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.291
Uh, listen, are-are you
gonna be all right?

20:49.374 --> 20:50.959
Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:51.043 --> 20:53.504
(sniffs):
Is that smoke? (gasping)

20:54.796 --> 20:55.923
Idea for a farce:

20:56.006 --> 20:58.217
cheating wife
and pompous ass burned alive.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.219
(maniacal laughter)

21:09.853 --> 21:10.979
So what happened?

21:11.063 --> 21:13.106
Well, you wanna know what
I learned this week?

21:13.190 --> 21:14.900
Being a grown-up sucks.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.402
Women, Brian. What a
royal pain in the ass.

21:17.486 --> 21:18.987
It's like, it's
like, why can't

21:19.071 --> 21:20.822
you just hang out
with guys, you know?

21:20.906 --> 21:22.699
Just live with someone
of your own sex.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.368
Just do what you
would do with women,

21:24.451 --> 21:27.162
but with your buddy, you know, w-why don't
guys just do that?

21:27.246 --> 21:29.081
They do, it's
called being gay.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.666
Oh, that's what gay is?

21:30.791 --> 21:32.584
Oh, yeah, I could
totally get into that.
