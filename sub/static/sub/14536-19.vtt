WEBVTT

00:03.553 --> 00:06.989
KC Cooper, get down here!

00:07.024 --> 00:08.448
You're gonna be late for school.

00:08.483 --> 00:09.708
Again!

00:12.521 --> 00:15.271
Sorry, Mom, okay?

00:15.307 --> 00:16.806
You know I can't go to school

00:16.841 --> 00:18.950
until I look perfect.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.561
KC, why can't you put
as much effort

00:21.596 --> 00:23.105
into actually learning?

00:23.140 --> 00:25.149
I was up all night studying.

00:25.184 --> 00:28.185
Online videos on how to
choose the perfect lip gloss.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.145
Uh, nailed it.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.955
I just don't feel right about it, KC.
It's too dangerous.

00:36.979 --> 00:38.495
What other option do we have?

00:38.530 --> 00:40.022
Ernie has been taken prisoner,

00:40.057 --> 00:42.324
the Organization
cannot locate him,

00:42.359 --> 00:45.076
and we know he's been put into
this virtual reality program,

00:45.111 --> 00:47.012
but unless you put me
in there with him,

00:47.048 --> 00:48.341
we're not gonna be able
to find out where he is.

00:48.365 --> 00:49.914
We don't have a choice, Craig.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.434
All right. According to intel,

00:52.469 --> 00:54.556
the group that took Ernie
was after a top-secret password

00:54.580 --> 00:57.105
that he created.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.533
He never revealed that code
in the real world,

00:59.568 --> 01:01.835
but in this virtual program,
it's only a matter of time

01:01.870 --> 01:04.104
before he spills his guts.

01:04.139 --> 01:06.039
Yeah, and the results
would be uglier

01:06.074 --> 01:07.343
than that time
he spilled his guts

01:07.367 --> 01:09.142
after eating that raw onion.

01:09.177 --> 01:11.253
Did you really have to
bring that up now?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.728
That is exactly
what I said to Ernie.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.283
Okay, now remember,

01:16.318 --> 01:18.060
once you enter virtual reality,

01:18.095 --> 01:20.128
you become
a part of the program,

01:20.164 --> 01:21.766
so you're not gonna remember
who you really are

01:21.790 --> 01:24.682
or why you're there

01:24.718 --> 01:26.170
- until you break through virtual disorientation.
- Meaning?

01:26.194 --> 01:27.763
Meaning things in that world
could be very different

01:27.787 --> 01:29.880
just to throw you off.

01:29.915 --> 01:33.208
Please, guys.
I can handle this, okay.

01:33.243 --> 01:35.243
I'm not gonna forget
who I am or what I came to do.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.134
Mom, I don't think
I can go to school today.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.219
Oh, poor baby.

01:44.255 --> 01:46.388
What's wrong? You have a fever?

01:46.423 --> 01:47.564
Worse.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.033
Split ends.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.493
( Scoffs )

01:51.528 --> 01:53.670
( crying )

01:53.705 --> 01:55.188
Why does this
have to happen to me?

01:57.834 --> 02:01.219
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:01.254 --> 02:04.414
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:04.491 --> 02:08.368
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:08.403 --> 02:12.388
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:12.424 --> 02:16.092
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:16.127 --> 02:18.186
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:18.222 --> 02:22.257
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:22.292 --> 02:26.194
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:26.230 --> 02:28.263
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:28.298 --> 02:30.540
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:30.575 --> 02:32.976
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:33.012 --> 02:35.128
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:35.163 --> 02:36.972
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:37.007 --> 02:39.215
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:39.250 --> 02:41.894
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:41.929 --> 02:42.963
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:42.987 --> 02:45.355
I keep it undercover.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.390
I keep it undercover.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.046
Oh, hey, Jason, hey, Joey.
Hey, Seth, hey, Scott.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.890
Wassup, Kirk?

03:03.926 --> 03:07.102
Uh, KC, when you're done saying
hi to every boy in school,

03:07.179 --> 03:07.861
would you mind saying
hello to your best friend?

03:07.896 --> 03:10.347
( Snorts )

03:10.382 --> 03:12.174
Oh, hey, Marisa.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.225
Quick question.
Are you planning on

03:14.261 --> 03:15.844
tending to the pigs and chickens

03:15.879 --> 03:16.998
in your pappy's farm
after school,

03:17.022 --> 03:19.448
because that is the only reason

03:19.524 --> 03:21.404
I could think of for you
to be wearing overalls.

03:23.645 --> 03:28.131
I'm too busy studying
to worry about clothes, so...

03:28.167 --> 03:30.175
You're also too busy
studying to worry about hair,

03:30.210 --> 03:31.985
and makeup and boys.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.120
But you know what?
We can fix that,

03:34.156 --> 03:36.122
when we go to
the Halloween dance!

03:38.151 --> 03:40.110
Great. I can go
dressed as someone

03:40.145 --> 03:42.654
who would rather be
anywhere else. (Snorts )

03:42.689 --> 03:46.732
STUDENTS: Ernie, Ernie,
Ernie, Ernie.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.161
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.904
That's weird. It seems like

03:51.940 --> 03:53.026
Ernie's the most popular
kid in school.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.475
Uh, don't be ridiculous.

03:55.510 --> 03:57.394
He's the most popular
kid in the world.

04:02.934 --> 04:04.818
That's weird.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.528
All of a sudden,
I have this weird feeling

04:07.564 --> 04:08.658
like I'm forgetting something.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.275
Is it to go to class, 'cause
you always forget to do that.

04:12.310 --> 04:15.253
No, I don't think
it's about school.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.371
With you, it never is.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.001
Yo, Mr. Awesome,
I need your help.

04:21.036 --> 04:23.970
Dude, I can't win every game
by 200 points for you.

04:24.005 --> 04:25.485
Oh, who am I kidding?
Of course I can.

04:28.793 --> 04:31.444
Actually, I need help remembering
my locker combination.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.240
It's a code, and it's
impossible to figure out.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.900
It just so happens I know a code
that's impossible to figure out.

04:37.936 --> 04:40.437
It's 2-V...

04:40.472 --> 04:43.198
Hey, Ernie, what should
I wear to the Halloween dance?

04:43.233 --> 04:45.374
Why don't you go dressed up as

04:45.410 --> 04:47.019
the most annoying person
in the world?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.870
Oh, wait, you do that every day.

04:48.906 --> 04:50.296
( laughter )

04:50.332 --> 04:52.882
Even though you're mocking me,

04:52.918 --> 04:54.860
your own sister, and I
feel you should be heard,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.762
I also find it hilarious.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.797
( Forced laughter )

05:04.271 --> 05:06.880
Did you see that?

05:06.915 --> 05:09.427
Ernie was about to say the code
when that KC avatar cut him off.

05:09.451 --> 05:11.876
There's a system breach.
They're on to us.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.572
The organization must've
inserted the real KC

05:13.596 --> 05:14.696
to rescue her brother.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.639
Or maybe she's there

05:16.674 --> 05:19.392
because she couldn't get
a flight to Cancun

05:19.427 --> 05:22.203
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure
the Organization's on to us.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.564
I know. I was being sarcastic.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.391
Oh. ( Laughs ) Sorry.

05:26.427 --> 05:30.394
It's hard to tell because
you're... such a good actor.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.815
That code is locked in
this loser's brain,

05:33.850 --> 05:36.517
and his stupid sister's not gonna
stop me from finding it out.

05:36.552 --> 05:38.344
KC Cooper doesn't scare me.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.806
In fact, she'll make the game
more fun to win.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.116
( Raucous laughter )

05:43.151 --> 05:45.251
That's a good one, Darcy.

05:45.286 --> 05:46.731
I wasn't being sarcastic
that time, Damon.

05:46.755 --> 05:48.138
I knew that.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.423
No, you didn't - No, I didn't.

05:52.536 --> 05:53.629
If the jock can't get
the code out of him,

05:53.653 --> 05:56.763
I know someone in his life
who won't take no for an answer.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.051
Hey, you!

06:01.086 --> 06:03.945
Isn't this free
garlic knots day?

06:03.980 --> 06:05.713
I want my free garlic knots.

06:05.748 --> 06:06.868
Where are my garlicky knots?

06:11.587 --> 06:13.847
So it's not free knots day.

06:13.882 --> 06:17.575
Oh. Well, knot, knot,
who's there?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.130
Guess what.
I still want my free knots.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.190
ALL: Ernie!

06:24.225 --> 06:28.127
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie,
Ernie, Ernie!

06:28.162 --> 06:30.263
Oh, you guys don't have to
shout my name

06:30.298 --> 06:32.498
every time I walk in a room.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.574
Feel free to mix it up
and throw some flower petals.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.531
Yeah, like that.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.108
Hi, Ernie.

06:42.143 --> 06:44.202
Oh, hi, Mrs. Goldfeder.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.254
What a coinky-dink
running into you.

06:46.289 --> 06:48.172
Yeah. 16,000 lines of code.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.983
Real coinky-dink.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.589
Ernie, or should I say,
Mr. Awesome,

06:56.625 --> 07:00.034
I could really use
your help with Petey.

07:00.069 --> 07:02.520
He's always looking at
cartoons on my tablet,

07:02.555 --> 07:05.348
and I need a secure password.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.043
Perhaps something that
starts with 2-V.

07:08.078 --> 07:11.971
2 V, or not 2 V.

07:12.006 --> 07:13.982
That is the question.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.935
( Raucous laughter )

07:16.970 --> 07:18.853
But it is 2-V. What's the rest?

07:18.889 --> 07:22.890
Try 2-V-8...

07:22.926 --> 07:25.384
Hey, bro, I need to talk to you.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.446
What are you wearing?
You look different?

07:28.481 --> 07:31.098
I know. No makeup,
no dress, no heels.

07:31.134 --> 07:33.254
If being glammed out is wrong,
I don't wanna be right.

07:34.963 --> 07:37.230
KC's back and her virtual
disorientation's wearing off.

07:37.265 --> 07:38.965
Really? I didn't notice.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.417
No, it's true.
You can tell because...

07:41.452 --> 07:44.896
Oh, you got me again.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.865
You gotta keep her
away from Ernie.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.843
Come on, Mrs. Goldfeder.
Get him outta there.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.821
Hey, Ernie, there's
some people down the street

07:52.856 --> 07:56.249
who want to listen to you
describe in detail

07:56.285 --> 07:59.627
the plot to all three
<i>Lord of the Ring</i> movies.

07:59.662 --> 08:01.179
Duty calls. Gotta go.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.992
Hey...

08:06.027 --> 08:08.131
Excuse me, Mrs. Goldfeder.
I need to go talk to my brother.

08:08.155 --> 08:12.039
You'll have to get
through me first.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.700
Well, that doesn't sound
very pleasant.

08:13.735 --> 08:14.776
Oh, it's not gonna be.

08:19.315 --> 08:22.283
Well, that wasn't very neighborly
of you, Mrs. Goldfeder,

08:22.319 --> 08:23.599
but then again, neither is this.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.392
Wait. How do I know
how to fight?

08:31.428 --> 08:32.961
Because I've been
trained to fight.

08:32.996 --> 08:34.045
( Both scream )

08:42.756 --> 08:44.556
( shrieking )

08:59.096 --> 09:01.439
Whew!

09:01.475 --> 09:05.535
Uh-oh. I'm gonna need
my garlic knots to go.

09:08.472 --> 09:11.157
All right, whoever you are,

09:11.193 --> 09:12.411
wherever you are, I broke
out of my disorientation,

09:12.435 --> 09:15.636
and I remember
what my mission is.

09:15.672 --> 09:17.964
<i>Look, I'm coming for you,
and whatever you throw at me,</i>

09:17.999 --> 09:19.699
<i>I will beat you
and save my brother.</i>

09:19.734 --> 09:22.243
And I sure hope
that somebody sees me right now,

09:22.278 --> 09:23.998
or else this rant
is extremely embarrassing.

09:36.484 --> 09:39.652
There's our little superstar.

09:39.687 --> 09:43.339
No, he's not little.
He's an ideal size.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.775
Compact and pleasantly
proportioned.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.344
I love you, son.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.396
Not as much as I do.

09:50.431 --> 09:51.731
I made your favorite dinner.

09:51.767 --> 09:54.300
Turkey tetrazzini.

09:54.335 --> 09:57.220
Pinch me, I'm dreaming.

09:57.255 --> 09:59.371
Why would you say that?

09:59.407 --> 10:01.657
There's no dream.
Everything here is real.

10:01.692 --> 10:04.126
Extremely real.
Here. Have a puppy.

10:04.161 --> 10:07.738
A puppy?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.614
And it's just like
the one I always dreamed of.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.043
Oh, it's no accident.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.295
Although that is.

10:14.331 --> 10:16.522
By the way, honey,

10:16.557 --> 10:20.009
Rihanna, the international
famous pop star,

10:20.044 --> 10:23.888
called you, and she wants you
to be her special guest

10:23.923 --> 10:25.581
at her concert next week.

10:25.616 --> 10:27.124
I wrote down her number.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.219
It's 2-V-8.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.805
Oh, no. I can't read the rest,

10:32.841 --> 10:36.217
because the dog peed on it.

10:36.294 --> 10:37.888
Don't sweat it, Mom.
That number sounds familiar.

10:37.912 --> 10:41.013
It's 2-V-8-J...

10:41.049 --> 10:43.508
Ernie, stop!

10:43.543 --> 10:45.693
Don't say anything else.
Mom is trying to trick you.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.545
What are you talking about?

10:47.581 --> 10:49.488
Does 2-V-J-8 sound like
a phone number to you?

10:49.524 --> 10:53.350
Actually, no. It doesn't.

10:53.386 --> 10:57.388
Oh, look. Surprise!

10:57.423 --> 10:58.898
We got you two puppies.

10:58.933 --> 11:00.959
Two puppies?!

11:00.994 --> 11:03.445
Puppy, puppy, puppy!

11:03.480 --> 11:05.287
Ugh. KC again.

11:05.323 --> 11:07.315
Aw, come on.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.417
All right,
Craig and Kira Cooper,

11:09.452 --> 11:11.994
you brought KC into this world,

11:12.030 --> 11:14.330
now it's time to take her out.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.161
Ernie, don't...

11:21.505 --> 11:23.189
Ernie, get to school!

11:23.224 --> 11:27.226
Or you'll be late for tonight's
Halloween dance, honey.

11:27.261 --> 11:30.529
Ooh. Halloween dance.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.318
Will there be a kiddie pool
full of frosting?

11:32.342 --> 11:33.342
Sure. Why not?

11:35.077 --> 11:37.228
Ernie, do not listen to
anything...

11:37.263 --> 11:39.798
Hurry up, Ernie.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.802
You don't wanna keep those
pretty young ladies waiting.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.660
You're right.
Time to get my boogie on

11:44.695 --> 11:45.815
and show off some new moves.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.434
You can't dance.
Your Nae-nae's a no-no.

11:51.469 --> 11:53.063
Uh, excuse me, Mom.
I need to talk to Ernie.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.647
What's the rush, KC? You've always
wondered if you could take us.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.583
Well, now you're
about to find out.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.429
I can't fight my own parents.

12:02.505 --> 12:04.425
Oh, good. Then that'll
make this go a lot faster.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.968
Something's upset KC.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.594
I hope no one in
that virtual world

12:18.629 --> 12:19.812
is trying to hurt my baby.

12:28.773 --> 12:32.300
Hang in there, KC.
Hang in there.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.255
If I could just get my hands on whoever's
in there hurting my little girl.

12:43.421 --> 12:45.299
Wait. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

12:45.323 --> 12:46.781
You guys aren't
really my parents.

12:46.816 --> 12:47.856
You guys aren't even real.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.575
Not real, huh?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.771
Was that real enough for you?

13:03.909 --> 13:05.553
Hey, guys, I have
this Halloween dance to go to.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.077
I'll probably miss my curfew,

13:08.154 --> 13:09.339
so if any of you guys
have a problem with that,

13:09.363 --> 13:10.446
please let me know now.

13:10.481 --> 13:12.281
Didn't think so.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.375
Hi, Ernie.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.502
Oh, hi, Marisa.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.834
I've done research on
this Ernie guy,

13:28.858 --> 13:30.558
and he's got some
secret feelings

13:30.593 --> 13:32.593
for this Marisa girl.

13:32.628 --> 13:34.562
Well, I guess when
two people are close,

13:34.597 --> 13:37.565
friendship can turn into love.

13:37.601 --> 13:39.267
Absolutely.

13:39.302 --> 13:41.293
But not with us.

13:41.328 --> 13:43.446
I knew that, I knew that.

13:43.481 --> 13:45.956
It's not like I'm into you.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.442
We work together.
That would be weird.

13:48.478 --> 13:50.945
Unless... you don't think so.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.116
- I think so.
- Me, too.

13:55.151 --> 13:57.535
Okay, Marisa,
time to turn on the charm.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.972
And when she does,
Ernie will be begging

13:58.996 --> 14:01.347
to spill the rest of the code.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.573
Nice cloak.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.808
Thanks.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.236
I love costumes on Halloween.

14:07.271 --> 14:09.351
They can be a little silly,
but they can also be hot.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.164
Is that a...

14:18.199 --> 14:21.642
Is that a Swords and Dragons
role-playing goblin costume?

14:24.213 --> 14:27.164
It is.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.925
I have a secret to confess.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.069
I'm a fourth level
dungeon master.

14:34.615 --> 14:37.274
I have a secret to confess, too.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.827
I've always wanted to date
a fourth level dungeon master.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.908
What are you doing?

14:45.944 --> 14:48.311
Dancing with you.
Aren't you enjoying it?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.880
Well, maybe a little.

14:53.334 --> 14:54.675
What about now?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.572
I can dance like this
all night if you want to.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.103
I want to, I want to!

15:10.735 --> 15:13.828
I have another
secret to confess.

15:13.863 --> 15:16.880
But suddenly, I can't
remember what it is,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.800
and it's really bothering me.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.727
It's a code,

15:21.762 --> 15:27.099
and it starts with 2-V-8-J...

15:27.134 --> 15:32.154
2-V-8-J...

15:32.189 --> 15:36.058
R... Wait, this
doesn't feel right.

15:36.093 --> 15:37.573
Why, 'cause I'm dressed
like a goblin?

15:39.997 --> 15:43.149
No. Because you're like
my sister.

15:43.184 --> 15:45.543
No. You're best friends
with my sister.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.603
Wait. Where's my sister?

15:50.466 --> 15:51.966
( Scoffs ) Why didn't that work?

15:52.001 --> 15:54.135
She was really
laying on the charm.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.029
Huh. I guess some people
don't know a good thing

15:57.064 --> 15:58.624
even when it's
staring them in the face.

16:00.643 --> 16:01.509
Please stop staring at me.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.252
I wasn't.

16:03.287 --> 16:04.378
- You were.
- No, I wasn't.

16:04.413 --> 16:05.413
Okay, maybe a little.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.809
Ernie's beginning to realize
this world isn't real.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.054
We're running out of time.

16:13.131 --> 16:14.416
I'm going in there
and getting that code myself.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.340
But if KC destroys you
while you're wired in,

16:16.375 --> 16:17.836
your consciousness
could be lost forever.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.560
Yeah, and if I destroy her,

16:19.595 --> 16:21.554
she'll be lost forever.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.682
Game on, KC.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.052
Ernie!

16:28.087 --> 16:29.186
Ernie.

16:43.644 --> 16:46.971
KC, I am so glad
you could make it.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.042
Oh, wait, there are boys here.
Of course you could make it.

16:49.066 --> 16:51.000
Oh, right, because
I'm boy crazy.

16:51.035 --> 16:52.760
Yeah, you know me.
I love, love, love boys.

16:52.795 --> 16:54.228
Anyway, where's Ernie?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.989
KC, don't be so rude.

16:57.024 --> 16:58.777
You haven't even said hi
to my new friend yet.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.567
Let me guess? A new boyfriend?

17:00.603 --> 17:03.512
Please. I'm too busy
studying to worry about boys.

17:03.547 --> 17:05.773
Ha. Now I know
we're in a fantasy world.

17:05.808 --> 17:08.567
KC, say hello to Darcy.

17:08.602 --> 17:11.086
Nice to meet you, KC.

17:11.121 --> 17:13.188
- Welcome to the game.
- Excuse me?

17:13.223 --> 17:17.527
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie,
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.

17:17.562 --> 17:19.462
Ernie, Ernie.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.940
Me, me, me.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.017
KC, how come you're
not chanting?

17:25.052 --> 17:26.352
Ernie, I need
to talk to you now.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.353
Actually, I need
to talk to him first.

17:28.389 --> 17:29.705
Please, Mr. Awesome?

17:33.060 --> 17:34.613
Oh, is that a kiddie pool
full of frosting?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.238
Sorry, KC,

17:37.273 --> 17:38.441
but the only way
you're getting to your brother

17:38.465 --> 17:39.965
is over my dead body.

17:40.001 --> 17:43.694
Et tu, Marisa? Et tu?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.846
Nice Julius Caesar reference.

17:45.882 --> 17:49.225
Oh, so now you know Shakespeare.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.046
Huh. Well, you definitely
aren't the real Marisa.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.103
Let's go.

18:17.005 --> 18:19.154
Look, Ernie,

18:19.189 --> 18:20.549
I couldn't say this
in front of KC,

18:20.583 --> 18:22.074
but your sister is sick.

18:22.110 --> 18:23.884
Tell me about it.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.877
She is jealous of the attention

18:25.913 --> 18:27.988
my parents pay to me,
their favorite child.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.998
Sure, they say they
love us equally,

18:30.033 --> 18:32.167
but really, they don't.

18:32.202 --> 18:35.688
Number one. <i>Numero uno.</i>

18:50.013 --> 18:51.479
She really is sick.

18:51.514 --> 18:55.216
She was exposed to a toxin
that makes her act irrationally.

18:55.251 --> 18:58.527
There is an antidote,
but it's locked in a cabinet,

18:58.562 --> 18:59.882
and we don't have
the access code.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.030
This was supposed to be
a piece of cake.

19:10.499 --> 19:11.599
Nice.

19:14.070 --> 19:18.939
It starts with 2-V-8-J-R...

19:18.975 --> 19:21.041
and then we don't have the rest.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.937
Well, this is a big mess.

19:24.972 --> 19:26.252
Fortunately, it's also not real.

19:29.477 --> 19:33.521
- It's 2-V-8-J-R...
- Ernie, stop.

19:33.556 --> 19:36.373
Oh, come on. He didn't even
say another digit this time.

19:37.977 --> 19:42.562
It's you, isn't it?

19:42.598 --> 19:43.464
You're the one that's beelike wear
dressesl thand heels and makeup

19:43.499 --> 19:47.492
and fight my best friend
in a pool full of frosting.

19:47.528 --> 19:51.163
Although I gotta admit, that last
part was actually delicious.

19:51.198 --> 19:52.958
But that is not the point.
The game ends now.

19:54.452 --> 19:56.135
I don't think so.

19:56.170 --> 19:57.603
I created this world, remember?

20:01.017 --> 20:03.308
Okay, Ernie, shoot her.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.021
- DARCY: No, shoot her.
- Don't listen to her.

20:05.045 --> 20:06.887
I don't know what to do!

20:06.923 --> 20:08.822
Ernie, listen to me.

20:08.858 --> 20:10.257
You're in a virtual world.

20:10.293 --> 20:13.752
The real Ernie
is not Mr. Awesome, okay?

20:13.787 --> 20:17.122
The real Ernie's a total loser.

20:17.157 --> 20:18.991
And you want me to leave
this virtual world

20:19.026 --> 20:20.834
and return to my real life why?

20:23.355 --> 20:25.848
Okay, so maybe I didn't
phrase it the best way,

20:25.883 --> 20:26.960
but look, I need to get you
out of here.

20:26.984 --> 20:28.792
Don't listen to her, Ernie.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.155
She's the only thing
that stands between you

20:30.179 --> 20:32.171
and eternal happiness.

20:32.206 --> 20:33.433
Just get rid of KC,
and you'll be

20:33.457 --> 20:34.649
the most important Cooper.

20:34.684 --> 20:37.751
One shot and all your
dreams can come true forever.

20:37.786 --> 20:40.445
Are we talking
turkey tetrazzini every night?

20:40.481 --> 20:42.765
Absolutely.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.418
Well, I guess I have no choice.

20:46.454 --> 20:50.280
- ( laser gun firing )
- ( shrieking )

20:50.316 --> 20:52.449
Well, that takes care of that.

20:54.512 --> 20:56.053
Ernie, you did it.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.797
You took out Darcy.

20:57.832 --> 20:59.272
You broke the virtual
disorientation.

21:01.110 --> 21:03.511
You're you again.

21:03.587 --> 21:07.481
Yeah. Hello, Ernie,
good-bye, turkey tetrazzini.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.107
At least I still have
my new puppies.

21:09.143 --> 21:13.312
- Uh, well...
- Oh, great.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.280
Ernie, we're trying to find
you in the real world.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.723
Where are they holding
you prisoner?

21:16.758 --> 21:18.325
In a storage facility
on Trendell Road.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
Okay, I'm on my way.

21:21.097 --> 21:22.755
Guys, we've gotta save Ernie.

21:22.790 --> 21:23.875
He's at a storage facility
on Trendell Road.

21:23.899 --> 21:26.600
Which unit? There's hundreds
of 'em at that location.

21:26.635 --> 21:29.445
Aw, man!

21:29.480 --> 21:31.560
Don't just stand there.
Put the wire back on my head.

21:36.112 --> 21:37.928
Darcy, Darcy.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.880
I'm okay, I'm okay.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.999
Get off me.

21:45.997 --> 21:47.504
It's over. Let's go.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.262
Hey, bro.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.031
KC?

21:57.066 --> 21:58.340
Am I still popular?

21:58.375 --> 22:00.685
Uh, well, um...

22:00.720 --> 22:01.935
To me you are.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.773
So that's a no.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.005
You kept me from revealing
the secret code,

22:11.029 --> 22:12.438
and you saved my life.

22:12.473 --> 22:14.656
Hey, you saved mine first.

22:14.691 --> 22:17.585
Yeah, well, I guess
I'd rather be a loser

22:17.661 --> 22:19.578
in a world with KC than in
paradise without her.

22:19.613 --> 22:21.888
Oh!

22:21.924 --> 22:23.874
You really are Mr. Awesome.

22:27.404 --> 22:28.754
Uh, KC?

22:28.789 --> 22:30.689
KC!

22:30.724 --> 22:32.049
My bad, bro.

22:35.929 --> 22:37.838
( Sighs contentedly )

22:37.873 --> 22:40.215
Aren't you glad
that we ran away,

22:40.251 --> 22:41.411
and now we can spend
the rest of our lives

22:41.435 --> 22:42.435
together on this beach?

22:44.705 --> 22:48.265
I'm not complaining.

22:48.301 --> 22:51.310
Can you pass me my fresh
papaya smoothie, please?

22:51.345 --> 22:54.405
Anything for you... babe.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.451
KC. We're going to
the movies now.

23:01.614 --> 23:02.712
KC!

23:02.748 --> 23:03.748
KC!

23:07.462 --> 23:08.794
Never mind.

23:15.544 --> 23:18.061
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
