WEBVTT

01:24.010 --> 01:26.010
- Look at me.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.200
Look at me.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.210
Please don't make me do this.

01:37.220 --> 01:41.210
- We've worked so hard

01:37.220 --> 01:41.210
for this moment.

01:41.220 --> 01:44.150
- I don't think I can do it.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.120
- Yes, you can.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.070
I know you can.

01:48.090 --> 01:50.210
I believe in you...

01:52.270 --> 01:54.090
My love.

01:54.090 --> 01:56.030
More than ever.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.150
You do?

02:04.120 --> 02:10.080
- ♪ Frère Jacque,

02:04.120 --> 02:10.080
Frère Jacque ♪

02:11.120 --> 02:17.050
♪ Dormez-vous, dormez-vous? ♪

04:27.230 --> 04:31.070
- The man that I was before...

04:31.080 --> 04:33.110
would he have been able

04:31.080 --> 04:33.110
to kill them?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.260
- The man you  were...

04:35.270 --> 04:38.260
sent here by the CIA...

04:38.270 --> 04:40.070
to murder me.

04:40.090 --> 04:42.090
And now look at you.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.220
Such progress.

04:44.190 --> 04:47.070
These methods of mine,

04:44.190 --> 04:47.070
I know...

04:47.090 --> 04:49.170
they are complicated.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.140
But you...

04:52.230 --> 04:56.240
You are

04:52.230 --> 04:56.240
my most promising subject.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.250
My cicada.

04:59.260 --> 05:01.180
- A cicada?

05:01.190 --> 05:03.130
- An amazing little creature.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.120
They burrow underground

05:05.120 --> 05:08.120
just beneath the surface...

05:08.130 --> 05:10.120
for years at a time...

05:10.130 --> 05:11.250
and wait.

05:11.250 --> 05:15.220
And then they awaken

05:11.250 --> 05:15.220
from their long slumber.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.050
- And die.

05:17.060 --> 05:21.270
- Yes--but not before

05:17.060 --> 05:21.270
they fulfill their destiny.

05:21.290 --> 05:26.120
You will be a great solider

05:21.290 --> 05:26.120
for our cause.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.250
But right now...

05:27.250 --> 05:29.000
you need your rest.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.270
- Wait, Dr. Meisner.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.270
There's something

05:36.000 --> 05:37.270
I need to ask.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.090
- Okay.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.010
Gustav...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.250
Jesus.

09:06.030 --> 09:07.270
- I believed in you.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.240
I thought we had something.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.210
- Halt!

11:34.280 --> 11:36.250
- Are you seeing

11:34.280 --> 11:36.250
what I'm seeing?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.220
Okay.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.080
Tell Levine I'll be in the

11:39.250 --> 11:41.080
situation room in two minutes.

11:41.090 --> 11:44.200
We've just received

11:41.090 --> 11:44.200
an incoming message

11:44.210 --> 11:46.200
from General Chin-Hwa Kwon

11:46.210 --> 11:48.000
of the North Korean

11:46.210 --> 11:48.000
People's Army.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.170
He's in London

11:48.010 --> 11:49.170
with a delegation,

11:49.190 --> 11:53.010
and he's requested to speak

11:49.190 --> 11:53.010
to a woman named Tara Coleman.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.240
Now, this request

11:53.020 --> 11:55.240
is completely unprecedented

11:55.250 --> 11:57.240
given Kwon's position,

11:55.250 --> 11:57.240
so I need to know everything

11:57.250 --> 11:59.130
about this woman, Tara Coleman.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.200
- She's a journalist.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.000
- Used to be a journalist.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.240
She's currently

12:02.000 --> 12:03.240
a London cab driver.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.050
- We've got Matt Edwards

12:03.250 --> 12:06.050
on the ground, he's in London.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.100
- I'm moving.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.100
- 60 seconds out.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.030
- What's her background?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.120
- Raised in London,

12:14.120 --> 12:15.160
both parents and her sister

12:15.170 --> 12:17.280
killed in a car accident

12:15.170 --> 12:17.280
when she was 10.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.100
She was also in the vehicle.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.230
She was the lone survivor.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.100
- None of which explains

12:22.110 --> 12:23.220
why Tara Coleman

12:22.110 --> 12:23.220
is the woman of the hour.

12:23.230 --> 12:25.230
- This might have something

12:23.230 --> 12:25.230
to do with an article

12:25.240 --> 12:27.070
that she was working on

12:25.240 --> 12:27.070
a few years ago.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.200
- Headline?

12:28.210 --> 12:32.000
- Soviet era nuke currently

12:28.210 --> 12:32.000
aimed at Washington, D.C.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.080
She believes

12:34.120 --> 12:37.080
that a decommissioned nuke

12:37.090 --> 12:40.080
known as Stiletto Six

12:37.090 --> 12:40.080
ended up on the black market.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.250
This was full of holes;

12:40.090 --> 12:42.250
she lost all credibility.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.100
Editor pulled the plug on it,

12:42.250 --> 12:45.100
fired her,

12:45.110 --> 12:46.230
and she has not

12:45.110 --> 12:46.230
published a word since.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.000
- Was she right--about

12:46.240 --> 12:50.000
a nuke being aimed at D.C.?

12:50.010 --> 12:52.000
- No, not as far as

12:50.010 --> 12:52.000
the Agency's concerned.

12:52.010 --> 12:53.250
- Well, that's not exactly

12:52.010 --> 12:53.250
reassuring.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.120
- Five seconds out.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.210
- Why is potentially

12:55.120 --> 12:56.210
the most valuable defector

12:56.220 --> 12:57.210
in North Korean history

12:57.220 --> 12:59.240
asking to speak

12:57.220 --> 12:59.240
to a discredited journalist

12:59.250 --> 13:00.190
turned cab driver?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.120
- I don't know.

13:01.130 --> 13:03.070
Ask her yourself.

13:06.070 --> 13:07.230
- Matt Edwards?

13:06.070 --> 13:07.230
- Yeah.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.250
Marriott County Hall.

13:14.070 --> 13:15.050
- Okay.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.280
- Traffic cam

13:22.260 --> 13:24.280
at A301 and Strand--

13:25.000 --> 13:27.120
she's headed south

13:25.000 --> 13:27.120
towards Westminster Bridge.

13:30.090 --> 13:32.020
- I like Fela Kuti, too.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.260
You're into Nigerian music?

13:34.270 --> 13:35.220
- Yeah,

13:34.270 --> 13:35.220
I spent some time there.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.120
- Oh, my sister got me into it.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.260
- Yeah?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.260
Is that her?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.090
- Yeah.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.260
- You two close?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.020
- She's my best friend.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.040
- Oh, uh, take Belvedere road.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.270
- Uh, we'll get stuck

13:48.050 --> 13:49.270
in traffic.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.080
- Well,

13:49.280 --> 13:51.080
I could use the extra time

13:51.090 --> 13:52.130
to talk to you about something.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.000
I'm here right now because

13:57.000 --> 13:58.110
there's a North Korean general

13:57.000 --> 13:58.110
in London.

14:00.030 --> 14:02.250
Man, you seemed so normal

14:00.030 --> 14:02.250
a minute ago.

14:02.260 --> 14:04.280
- The general

14:02.260 --> 14:04.280
will only talk to you.

14:07.000 --> 14:07.270
- This is a joke, right?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.010
- He wants to meet you

14:07.280 --> 14:10.010
in an hour.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.130
I figured he might want

14:10.020 --> 14:12.130
to ask you about Stiletto Six.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.140
- Who are you?

14:14.150 --> 14:16.050
- This isn't a joke, Tara.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.010
- Answer my question.

14:17.020 --> 14:19.070
- I work for the

14:17.020 --> 14:19.070
U.S. State Department.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.000
- You mean the CIA.

14:21.010 --> 14:22.020
- I have her.

14:22.030 --> 14:23.000
They're still heading south.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.100
- Get me a photo

14:23.000 --> 14:24.100
on that bridge.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.110
- Why me?

14:27.120 --> 14:29.080
- Maybe he's got a story.

14:29.090 --> 14:30.100
You're a journalist.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.170
- If you knew how to find me

14:31.190 --> 14:33.110
then you know

14:31.190 --> 14:33.110
I'm not a journalist anymore.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.090
- I know your history.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.170
Help us out with General Kwon,

14:36.190 --> 14:39.130
and I can help you

14:36.190 --> 14:39.130
get your reputation back.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.010
I just need ten minutes.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.010
Are you in?

14:46.270 --> 14:48.070
- Operation's a go, let's move!

14:51.100 --> 14:52.250
- It's an amplified mic.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.280
We'll have ears

14:52.250 --> 14:53.280
but not eyes on you.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.080
- Am I going in alone?

14:57.090 --> 14:59.010
- Kwon said he'd walk

14:57.090 --> 14:59.010
if he saw anyone else.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.070
I'll be with my team

14:59.020 --> 15:01.070
right outside the building.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.260
And one of

15:01.080 --> 15:02.260
General Kwon's associates

15:02.270 --> 15:03.260
will be waiting for you

15:02.270 --> 15:03.260
in the lobby.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.240
He'll bring you

15:03.270 --> 15:04.240
to the meet.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.130
Good luck.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.000
- Clear copy,

15:23.000 --> 15:23.260
repeat, clear copy.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.140
- General Kwon

15:23.270 --> 15:26.140
has exited the ballroom.

15:26.150 --> 15:28.270
- Tara's leaving the second

15:26.150 --> 15:28.270
floor elevator right now

15:28.280 --> 15:31.020
heading for the men's room on

15:28.280 --> 15:31.020
the east end of the building.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
- General Kwon?

15:45.170 --> 15:46.260
- Thank you for coming.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.020
- What's this about?

15:51.030 --> 15:52.130
- You can't trust the CIA.

15:52.140 --> 15:53.200
They're waking them up.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.000
- Waking who up?

15:57.160 --> 15:58.120
- The cicadas.

15:58.130 --> 16:00.120
It's starting again.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.270
- What's starting again?

16:01.280 --> 16:02.270
- Treadstone.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.000
- What's Treadstone?

16:23.110 --> 16:24.090
- I've lost audio.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.200
SAD unit,

16:24.100 --> 16:25.200
prepare to make entry.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.070
- Audio down.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
- Repeat,

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
prepare to make entry.

16:28.090 --> 16:29.220
- Stand down.

16:29.230 --> 16:31.200
Stand down,

16:29.230 --> 16:31.200
just let this play out.

16:33.030 --> 16:34.120
- What the hell is Treadstone?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.130
- I was sending a message.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.070
We don't have much time.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.090
- What the fuck, Dan?

16:38.100 --> 16:39.130
Treadstone?

16:39.140 --> 16:40.170
- Clear the room.

16:40.190 --> 16:43.020
Please, everybody out.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.170
- In less than a minute,

16:43.030 --> 16:45.170
SAD will reach the building.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.050
- Then tell me

16:45.190 --> 16:47.050
what I'm doing here.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.250
- A rogue group in North Korea

16:47.070 --> 16:48.250
has raised funds

16:48.260 --> 16:51.020
to purchase the Stiletto Six

16:48.260 --> 16:51.020
launch codes

16:51.030 --> 16:54.170
from a Russian man

16:51.030 --> 16:54.170
named Yuri Leniov.

16:54.190 --> 16:57.110
They're looking to upset

16:54.190 --> 16:57.110
the balance of power.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.130
I need you to acquire the

16:57.120 --> 17:00.130
launch codes before they do.

17:00.140 --> 17:03.200
- How am I supposed to do that?

17:03.210 --> 17:07.170
- I have a daughter who attends

17:03.210 --> 17:07.170
boarding school in France.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.230
Her name is Jang-Mi.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.180
Bring her to the

17:09.240 --> 17:12.180
Ecuadorian Embassy in Paris.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.130
The ambassador

17:12.190 --> 17:14.130
is expecting you.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.030
He will give you

17:14.140 --> 17:16.030
what you need.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.109
- I need to think this through.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.190
- My enemies

17:17.130 --> 17:19.190
already suspect me.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.190
They have targeted me

17:19.200 --> 17:21.190
and my daughter.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.240
You have to find her

17:21.200 --> 17:22.240
immediately, Tara.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.200
- Why can't you

17:22.250 --> 17:24.200
do anything about it?

17:26.069 --> 17:28.030
- I won't live long enough.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.080
Give her this.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.000
Tell my daughter I love her.

17:45.010 --> 17:46.210
- Why are you trusting me

17:45.010 --> 17:46.210
with this?

17:46.220 --> 17:50.170
- Because of your single-minded

17:46.220 --> 17:50.170
pursuit of Stiletto Six.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.100
You lost your career

17:50.180 --> 17:52.100
as a journalist

17:52.110 --> 17:53.250
because you weren't willing

17:52.110 --> 17:53.250
to back down

17:53.250 --> 17:56.190
from your instincts about it.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.150
You also know what it's like

17:58.080 --> 18:00.150
to lose your family.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.080
Please.

18:06.090 --> 18:08.150
Help me save mine.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.070
- What did Kwon mean

18:25.060 --> 18:27.070
by cicadas?

18:27.080 --> 18:28.070
- Ellen--

18:28.080 --> 18:30.110
- Why the hell

18:28.080 --> 18:30.110
was a North Korean general

18:30.130 --> 18:32.220
talking about Treadstone

18:30.130 --> 18:32.220
on an open wire?

18:33.140 --> 18:35.100
- What's Treadstone?

18:35.110 --> 18:37.130
- That's classified, Tara.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.160
- We shut that down

18:37.140 --> 18:39.160
years ago, Dan.

18:39.170 --> 18:40.230
- Kwon was part of the program.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.250
- Did he mention Stiletto Six?

18:43.250 --> 18:45.180
- No.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.140
I think he was

18:45.190 --> 18:47.140
playing your people.

18:47.150 --> 18:48.270
- He's playing with us, Ellen.

18:48.280 --> 18:52.100
Yeah, today he dangles

18:48.280 --> 18:52.100
the possibility of defection,

18:52.110 --> 18:53.200
then he's

18:52.110 --> 18:53.200
digging up skeletons

18:53.210 --> 18:57.170
precisely so that we will have

18:53.210 --> 18:57.170
conversations like this one.

19:06.050 --> 19:09.140
- If you don't trust me,

19:06.050 --> 19:09.140
don't expect me to trust you.

19:09.150 --> 19:12.180
- You're playing me right now.

19:12.190 --> 19:15.080
- Thanks for

19:12.190 --> 19:15.080
an interesting afternoon.

19:27.230 --> 19:30.050
- We did shut down

19:27.230 --> 19:30.050
Treadstone...

19:30.060 --> 19:33.030
right?

19:33.040 --> 19:36.180
- It was bigger

19:33.040 --> 19:36.180
than we thought.

19:36.190 --> 19:40.130
- So who are these cicadas

19:36.190 --> 19:40.130
he's talking about waking up?

23:35.230 --> 23:37.020
- Come on,

23:35.230 --> 23:37.020
put your backs into it!

23:43.070 --> 23:45.020
- Hold it up.

23:43.070 --> 23:45.020
Right there.

23:47.230 --> 23:49.010
- Careful.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.270
- That all you got, man?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.190
- I had four hours of sleep.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.220
Yeah, it's all I got.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.230
- Maybe it's those pills

23:59.230 --> 24:02.230
Samantha has you taking.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.260
- How do you know about those?

24:05.270 --> 24:09.030
- She asked if I'd check and

24:05.270 --> 24:09.030
make sure you were taking 'em.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.140
- My wife asked you to make

24:09.040 --> 24:12.140
sure I'm taking my pills?

24:12.150 --> 24:14.090
- Not my business,

24:12.150 --> 24:14.090
I'm staying out of it.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.070
- Hold the work, everybody,

24:14.100 --> 24:16.070
hold the work!

24:16.080 --> 24:17.280
Listen up, fellas!

24:18.000 --> 24:19.280
Management wants you

24:18.000 --> 24:19.280
in the mess hall right now.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.070
- Let's go, come on!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.070
- Can you get it?

24:21.270 --> 24:24.000
- Everybody down

24:21.270 --> 24:24.000
to the mess hall!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.020
- It's a great day

24:24.000 --> 24:26.020
for ExPo Energy.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.250
Congress has passed the bill

24:27.250 --> 24:30.240
that approves our deal

24:27.250 --> 24:30.240
with our Russian partners.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.100
This should nearly

24:30.250 --> 24:32.100
double our capacity

24:32.110 --> 24:34.210
in the next five years.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.250
But I'm not gonna lie--

24:35.250 --> 24:39.030
it's not good news

24:35.250 --> 24:39.030
for everyone here.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.210
I'm afraid I have some

24:39.040 --> 24:41.210
personnel changes to announce.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.210
Several members of the senior

24:41.220 --> 24:44.210
staff will be staying on

24:44.220 --> 24:47.040
but all level one, two,

24:44.220 --> 24:47.040
and three derrickmen,

24:47.050 --> 24:51.040
motormen, and roughnecks

24:47.050 --> 24:51.040
will be replaced--

24:51.050 --> 24:53.000
effective immediately.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
- Fuck you talking about?

24:55.210 --> 24:56.280
- Starting tomorrow morning

24:57.000 --> 24:59.160
a Russian crew

24:57.000 --> 24:59.160
will be taking over.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.080
Now, we will do

25:01.100 --> 25:03.080
everything we can

25:03.090 --> 25:06.080
to facilitate transfers

25:03.090 --> 25:06.080
to another rig.

25:06.090 --> 25:08.150
Unfortunately, at this time

25:06.090 --> 25:08.150
there are no reassignments.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.240
- Hey, keepin' your job, huh?

25:09.250 --> 25:10.190
- And I understand

25:09.250 --> 25:10.190
this is difficult...

25:10.200 --> 25:13.000
- Keepin' your job?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.010
-Your severance checks will be

25:13.000 --> 25:15.010
issued upon arrival in Seattle.

25:15.020 --> 25:16.280
Now, I understand

25:15.020 --> 25:16.280
there's anger...

25:44.110 --> 25:45.250
- Yo.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.000
Helicopter's making a run

25:45.260 --> 25:47.000
into town.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Let's go do some drinkin'.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.260

29:34.160 --> 29:38.280
I don't know why I'm so upset.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.190
- Do I know you?

29:44.020 --> 29:45.220
- I don't know.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.220
I work in supply.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.180
- Uh, I think we met before,

29:46.180 --> 29:49.180
right?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.010
Wow.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.130
I've never heard

29:52.020 --> 29:54.130
that line before.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.000
- Oh, wait, wait.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.130
You--you think

29:56.000 --> 29:57.130
I'm hittin' on you?

30:01.010 --> 30:02.110
- I'm just kidding.

30:04.090 --> 30:06.050
- Oh, right.

30:06.060 --> 30:07.070
I gotta tell you,

30:07.080 --> 30:09.070
I almost can't remember

30:07.080 --> 30:09.070
what that feels like.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.230
- Happily?

30:12.240 --> 30:14.280
- Yeah...very.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.140
- Turn that

30:15.000 --> 30:16.140
shit music off

30:16.150 --> 30:19.020
and give us some

30:16.150 --> 30:19.020
drinks.

30:20.010 --> 30:21.000
Hey, beautiful.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.080
Why don't you let me

30:21.000 --> 30:24.080
show you a good time?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.100
- Nice try, asshole.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.000
Maybe that works

30:26.110 --> 30:28.000
in your country.

30:29.030 --> 30:30.150
- Do you wanna come over here

30:29.030 --> 30:30.150
and try that?

30:30.160 --> 30:32.220
- He's not worth it.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.060
Listen, you took our jobs.

30:36.070 --> 30:37.240
Why don't you just try and be

30:36.070 --> 30:37.240
a good sport about it

30:37.250 --> 30:39.030
and sit down?

31:58.070 --> 32:00.030
- Holy shit, man.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.220
Where the hell

32:00.040 --> 32:01.220
have you been hiding that?

32:19.170 --> 32:20.180
- Hey.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.000
You okay?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.190
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.200
- You got a cut on your eye.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.000
Come on, let me clean you up.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.080
I've got a first aid kit

32:33.000 --> 32:36.080
back at my office.

32:36.090 --> 32:37.230
Come on.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.040
Where else you gotta be?

32:45.280 --> 32:47.240
Swelling's gone down.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.160
Looks like you'll live,

32:47.250 --> 32:49.160
tough guy.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.070
- Thanks, Doc.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.280
You mind?

33:05.050 --> 33:07.000
- Something's bothering you.

33:08.010 --> 33:09.070
I can tell.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.250
- I guess

33:18.100 --> 33:20.250
I'm not feeling myself lately.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.080
- I get it.

33:22.090 --> 33:25.250
You lose your job,

33:22.090 --> 33:25.250
you lose your identity.

33:25.250 --> 33:28.250
- No.

33:28.260 --> 33:32.000
It's more like

33:28.260 --> 33:32.000
I can't even remember

33:32.000 --> 33:36.210
who or what I ever wanted to be

33:32.000 --> 33:36.210
in the first place, like...

33:36.220 --> 33:40.220
those memories,

33:36.220 --> 33:40.220
they're just...gone.

33:40.230 --> 33:45.170
I keep having

33:40.230 --> 33:45.170
this recurring dream.

33:45.180 --> 33:48.260
I'm sitting

33:45.180 --> 33:48.260
in an empty white room...

33:48.270 --> 33:53.040
staring at myself in one of

33:48.270 --> 33:53.040
those two-way mirrors, and...

33:54.280 --> 33:57.010
The weird thing...

33:58.260 --> 34:02.110
There's another me on

33:58.260 --> 34:02.110
the other side of that mirror.

34:02.130 --> 34:04.040
Looking back.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.030
I can feel him.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.230
I'm sorry, I'm--

34:14.130 --> 34:16.230
I'm not making any sense.

34:16.230 --> 34:17.280
I really should go.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.010
- No.

34:20.030 --> 34:22.110
I wanna hear more.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.260
You should hear

34:22.130 --> 34:23.260

34:26.150 --> 34:28.230
I'm sure I've got a bottle
