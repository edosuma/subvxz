00:20.562 --> 00:21.813
The federal
government announced

00:21.897 --> 00:24.232
it will declare
bankruptcy in the next 90...

00:24.316 --> 00:27.819
Flags continue to be flown at
half-mast in the U.S. capital...

00:27.903 --> 00:30.071
...have
significantly deteriorated...

00:32.950 --> 00:34.325
...developing
global recession.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.037
...and sustained
an ultimately disastrous war.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.920
What do I remember?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.636
I remember reading
about a scientist.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.642
He had a thing
for cats and boxes.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.105
What he'd do is take a cat and lock it in a box.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.152
And then, just to
make things interesting,

01:10.279 --> 01:14.073
he'd also put this machine in
there that released poison gas.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.496
Now, the scientist
didn't actually know

01:20.581 --> 01:22.248
when the machine
would release the poison

01:22.332 --> 01:24.167
and when it wouldn't.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.544
The only way
he could tell for sure

01:26.754 --> 01:28.212
was to look inside the box.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.967
Here's the science bit.

01:33.677 --> 01:37.263
Until he opened it up,
he figured the cat had to be alive

01:37.806 --> 01:39.056
and dead.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.351
See, if either one
was possible,

01:42.853 --> 01:45.313
then both had to be
possible, too.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.528
Ever since I read
about that cat,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.198
I can't get the story
out of my head.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.325
Don't get me wrong,

01:57.409 --> 01:59.786
I don't give a fuck about the plight of small,
furry animals.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.829
I just don't understand.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.042
How can anything be alive
and dead at the same time?

02:18.388 --> 02:21.224
Are you ready for tonight's entertainment?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.231
Yeah,
go, go, go, go.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.609
Mr. Smythe?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.402
I'm from The Union.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.739
Holy fuck!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.867
Wait! Okay? Just wait.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.247
No worries. Keep it holstered.
Everything's okay.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.207
l can pay.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.125
Sorry, that's not
my department.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.055
Hey.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.016
Hey!

03:05.769 --> 03:07.395
Don't you
fucking touch me.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.605
No need
for violence, miss.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.166
Henry Smythe,
l am legally bound to ask you

03:29.251 --> 03:31.168
if you would like
an ambulance on standby

03:31.253 --> 03:33.838
in order to take you
to hospital.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.548
Nope?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.632
Okay.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.453
My job is simple.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.873
Can't pay for your car,
the bank takes it back.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.044
Can't pay for your house,
the bank takes it back.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.673
Can't pay for your liver,

04:59.091 --> 05:00.591
well, that's where I come in.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.777
Good morning, everybody.
I'm Eric Fitzsimmons.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.280
And I'm Sabrina Kenn.
From around the globe and around the corner,

05:23.365 --> 05:25.491
here's what's happening
in your world this morning.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.827
Some big news coming in
from Nigeria this morning.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.911
That's in Africa.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.496
Now,
of course, you know

05:30.580 --> 05:33.499
that we've already got
10,000, 15,000 soldiers

05:33.583 --> 05:35.501
over there, waiting
at the Nigerian border.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.462
Come home soon.
Well, not too soon. Word's coming in

05:38.547 --> 05:41.340
that the 34th Armored
Division has arrived,

05:41.425 --> 05:44.343
and they're ready to start
the sixth phase of the war.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.595
Operation
Hope Springs Eternal.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.561
Uh-uh-uh! Don't drink
out of the bottle.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.605
He does.
Well, you don't.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.568
I'm late.
Can you take him?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.613
Sure.
Thank you.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.453
...first place
at yesterday's annual

06:10.537 --> 06:13.789
Coney Island hot dog eating contest.
Can you say "indigestion"?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.209
Peter, leave it.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.171
You got everything?

06:20.255 --> 06:21.255
Yeah.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.133
Dad, I'm okay from here.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.804
All right.
Have a good day.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.181
Okay.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.594
Almost every job I do
ends the exact same way.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.306
Some whimper. Some cry.
Some even laugh.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.685
But in the end, they all do
the same horizontal mambo,

07:17.521 --> 07:20.356
twitching and thrusting their
way into the great beyond.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.236
Hey,
watch the suit!

07:25.320 --> 07:28.364
Sorry, sir. I didn't know that was you.
Sorry about that.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.244
The Union,
helping you get more you out of you.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.121
In years past,
nearly 200,000 people

07:36.206 --> 07:39.667
waited on organ transplant
lists at any given time,

07:39.751 --> 07:42.002
hoping for someone else to die

07:42.087 --> 07:44.296
so that they
could possibly live.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.007
But thanks to modern
biomedical science,

07:47.092 --> 07:48.843
the days of waiting
and praying are over.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.263
...where the artiforg is
expertly and cleanly inserted

07:52.347 --> 07:53.639
with minimal
invasion and scarring.

07:53.723 --> 08:00.396
Now, if you can't afford the
full payment of $618,429,

08:00.730 --> 08:05.067
we can offer monthly
installments at an APR of 19.6%,

08:05.151 --> 08:07.486
standard for a generic pancreatic unit.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.614
Frank Mercer,
Union Manager.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.741
l understand
you have concerns.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.286
Affordability.
lt's only natural.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.871
First of all, let me
just reassure you

08:16.955 --> 08:19.707
that our credit department will
find a plan that fits your lifestyle.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.250
And should you
fall behind,

08:21.334 --> 08:23.043
there is a three-month
grace period.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.629
Not until after the sixth day of
the fourth month of nonpayment

08:25.714 --> 08:27.840
will we retrieve the property,
at our own expense, of course,

08:27.924 --> 08:31.010
utilizing our skilled
and licensed technicians.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.888
Now, I'm not sure what you've
heard on the 6:00 news,

08:33.972 --> 08:35.639
but this almost
never happens.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.726
l got to tell you,
you owe it to your family.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.520
You owe it
to yourself.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.691
Now, if you could
just sign here, here,

08:45.775 --> 08:48.068
and initial here,
we can get started.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.945
He'll sign it.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.281
Everybody signs it.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.536
All right.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.541
Ears, ears, ears.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.962
Goddamn ears
again. Shit.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.048
A job's a job, right?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.926
I'm just saying, ears,
four times in a row.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.303
Fucking probation
ain't fair.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.430
Wasn't fair what you did to that
woman on the subway, was it?

09:20.435 --> 09:22.853
Yeah. Well, you weren't there,
were you?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.899
Hey, my sister's kid,
he wants in. He's a good kid.

09:26.983 --> 09:27.942
Talk to Frank.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.654
Yeah, but I figured l'd get a recommendation
from you, you know? Level Five?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.988
l don't know
the kid, do l?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.907
You're killing me,
coming in the front like that.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.075
l got guys trying to make sales out there,

09:36.159 --> 09:38.202
l don't need you on the floor spooking clients,
all right?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.704
We want them buying,
not thinking.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.791
Six paid-in-fulls this week.
You know what that means?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.209
No. What, Frank?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.293
They see you,

09:46.378 --> 09:48.420
they start turning down the loans
and coming up with the cash.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.840
We don't make money when they pay in full.
Right, pal?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.342
What do you got?
- Liver.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.347
What's that?
Liver.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.225
What, are you hanging out
at AA meetings?

10:01.768 --> 10:04.228
Day's count, give it up, buddy.
What's the magic number?

10:04.312 --> 10:05.813
Not today, Jake.

10:05.897 --> 10:06.897
Wrong answer.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.026
Jake Freivald kicked my ass in the fourth grade.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.612
It wasn't exactly fair,

10:13.697 --> 10:16.615
seeing as he was in the
fourth grade for the third time.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.284
Maybe he didn't appreciate
the rhyme scheme.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.036
But he had to admire
an aspiring writer

10:21.121 --> 10:22.329
who could give
as good as he got.

10:24.666 --> 10:29.712
After the war, a job at the Union was a
perfect match for our specialized skill-set.

10:30.046 --> 10:34.508
The recruiter told us we were protecting
America's medical establishment.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.428
We didn't care
who we were protecting.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.641
Fuck!

10:42.726 --> 10:44.226
Hey, come on.
Come on, come on.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.602
Here you go!

10:45.687 --> 10:47.896
Two livers
and a Jarvik!

10:50.525 --> 10:52.860
You got to stop nicking
these bar codes, Jake!

10:53.361 --> 10:55.112
Won't happen
again, boss!

10:56.740 --> 10:58.741
You okay, man? You okay?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.578
I'm working with
fucking children.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.582
Come on, let's go hit a few.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.252
Yeah, all right.
l've got to tell Carol.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.838
Of course you do.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.256
So, did you talk
to Frank today?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.177
About moving
over to sales?

11:18.261 --> 11:20.596
No, I didn't get
a chance.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.389
What?
You mean when you were standing next to him?

11:22.474 --> 11:25.017
Right.
Right, l'll talk to him on Monday.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.936
You know, you're turning me into a horrible,
naggy bitch.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.773
You were always
a horrible, naggy bitch.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.277
Just get him out of here.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.196
See you later.
Yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.365
Come on.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.950
That went well.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.869
Maybe next time she'll
crochet you a set of balls.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
What do you think?

11:46.372 --> 11:50.459
Come test-drive the most advanced
neural sensory replicator,

11:50.543 --> 11:53.629
The Union's M.5 Neural Net.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.048
Sweet dreams
are made of these.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.844
Stay super dry.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.351
You know what
this is about, right?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.311
lt's about control.
She's trying to control you.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.562
l mean,
you got to move from Repo to sales,

12:10.647 --> 12:13.190
that's like cutting your pay in half, man. Half.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.567
She thinks sales
is more stable.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.196
Nine to five, no late nights.
l'll be home more often.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.324
Buddy, you and me,
we're always gonna be Repo.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.377
Check out fatty.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.630
You know his organs
went out a long time ago.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.509
Twenty bucks
says he's overdue.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.511
Yeah, I'm in.
20 bucks.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.183
Deadbeat?
Almost.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.977
Pancreas. Two days.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.105
Oi! How's your
pancreas holding up?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.358
l sent the money in
this morning.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.901
You better hope
you did.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.820
48 hours,
your organ's mine.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.783
Slow down, mate.
You're gonna need a new heart, as well.

13:13.877 --> 13:17.546
P. Morton?
That's Patrick Morton.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.048
The guy from Company C?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.216
Yeah.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.093
Here, let me see it.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.393
The bastard... Bastard,
he still lives with his parents.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.734
Did you ever repo
anybody you know?

13:39.569 --> 13:40.903
l had to do
my granddad.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.779
What are you
laughing about?

13:42.864 --> 13:46.325
You try to explain that to your grandmother.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.826
Fuck you,
you didn't.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.955
l would. I would, on Day 96,
if they gave me the pink sheet.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.040
l know you would.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.750
A job's a job, right?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.252
Yeah, a job's a job.

13:59.756 --> 14:04.176
Now you say
you're sorry

14:04.260 --> 14:06.470
Hey, you want another beer or something?

14:06.763 --> 14:07.721
Oh, man.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.307
For being so untrue

14:10.391 --> 14:12.726
Stare any longer,
you'll be married by the weekend.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.396
Well, you can
cry me a river

14:17.106 --> 14:19.733
Cry me a river

14:19.817 --> 14:20.859
I'm gonna go start
a fight or something.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.696
I cried a river over you

14:25.448 --> 14:29.451
Well, you can cry me a river

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
Cry me a river

14:33.831 --> 14:37.459
I cried a river over you

14:48.304 --> 14:49.471
Hiya.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.809
Remember this?
Jimmy T-Bone?

15:36.686 --> 15:37.686
Hmm?

15:37.770 --> 15:38.770
Peter's sleeping.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.107
Well, we'll turn it down
and use our quiet voices.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.907
Music's too loud.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.961
Peanut.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.568
Peanut. Wake up.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.573
You awake? Hi.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.743
Hi.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.912
How was school?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.830
We learned
about the Romans.

16:38.915 --> 16:39.956
Mmm?

16:40.374 --> 16:41.958
l made the club.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.752
l can see.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.545
One for you, too.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.880
Thanks.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.177
Weren't these
from medieval times?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.428
Yeah.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.766
Mrs. Begs is making
me redo the project.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.561
Well, if she says redo it,
you better redo it.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.313
l hate the Romans.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.773
Aw, that's a shame.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.945
The Romans
were real badass.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.951
You know, they used to make
people fight with lions.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.539
Mrs. Begs says they used to burn down
all the villagers when they attacked them.

17:20.623 --> 17:24.291
She's right. Scorched earth.
Stones at the enemy.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.130
Pretty effective tactic.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.716
Hey, Dad?
What?

17:31.801 --> 17:34.636
Why did the Romans
stone people to death?

17:36.973 --> 17:39.391
'Cause they didn't
have any guns.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.853
Mmm.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.396
Go to sleep.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.275
Good night.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.031
l don't want to stifle you, but,
you know,

17:55.116 --> 17:56.741
you might wanna turn them
over just a little bit more.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.910
Well, if people ate them as
quickly as I'm cooking them,

17:58.995 --> 18:00.579
they wouldn't burn,
would they?

18:00.663 --> 18:03.832
All right. Hey, hey.
Hot dogs! Charbroiled.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.208
Save me one
of those, all right?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.418
Kind of crispy.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.548
Yeah?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.218
No,
this is not a good time,

18:15.303 --> 18:16.428
I'm not at home.
What do you want?

18:16.888 --> 18:18.180
Nobody eats the salad.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.598
No one ever eats
beetroot salad.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.225
l told you not to
waste your money on it.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.102
Okay, l'll
call you back. Bye.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.982
l need to...
l need to borrow your grill master for a minute.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.650
Give me your apron.
What?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.236
l got a mobile coming here right now.
You want some of this?

18:33.321 --> 18:34.779
To my house? Fuck, no.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.865
The guy's six months overdue.
No.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.284
lt's a double commission.
l'll give you half.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.702
Half.

18:40.953 --> 18:41.953
I'm paying you
for a full ride.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.205
l just want to get to
the Fairmont downtown.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.207
Don't worry.
You'll be done in a minute.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.168
Two minutes. Tops.
Two minutes, tops.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.461
Yeah.
Where's the case?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.671
Front closet.
You're a saint.

18:51.756 --> 18:52.881
l know.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.764
He's gone to
get more meat.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.156
Who's that guy?

19:20.534 --> 19:21.660
Who's that guy?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.828
Relax, fellow.
He's a friend of mine.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.497
He's a friend
of yours?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.958
Hey, come on, man. Come on,
let me out of here! Open the door!

19:28.042 --> 19:29.042
Come on, man!

19:30.419 --> 19:32.087
Thanks a lot, man.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.524
Where are you going?

19:52.650 --> 19:54.985
Getting a jacket.
l'll get you a...

19:55.987 --> 19:56.987
Carol!

19:58.990 --> 20:02.450
Hey. I could have gotten you a coat,
for goodness' sake.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.461
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.005
I'm stepping away, right now.
Get this out of here!

20:15.089 --> 20:16.214
No, no. He's gone.
He's out of here.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.883
Love, come on.
lt's just a kidney.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.177
He's got another one. He's fine.
- Jake?

20:21.262 --> 20:22.887
He's fine.
Jake.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.350
Peter, turn off
the phone!

20:27.643 --> 20:28.685
Give me that.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.691
Where are you
going?

20:34.775 --> 20:35.942
Where are you going?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.612
Oh, come on, not this.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.159
Let's talk about it, huh?
Slow down, let's talk about it.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.827
Make a decision.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.005
l went as fast
as I could, man.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.840
Yeah,
l know you did.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.302
l'll have to have
that talk with Frank.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.309
Did you hear about
that new M.5 Neural Net?

21:10.186 --> 21:13.521
No. You've been reading those
fucking pamphlets again?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.440
l saw it
at a trade show.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.860
The damn thing,
it takes over the whole limbic system.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.155
Brain damage, stroke,
you name it, it doesn't matter.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.282
They hook you up,
and then it's like

21:24.366 --> 21:26.451
you're living the rest of your life in a dream.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.660
Yeah?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.288
How do you
get it out?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.331
Hold on a second.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.792
Wait, wait, wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:33.876 --> 21:34.876
Shit.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.544
What?

21:40.424 --> 21:41.633
We got a nest.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.901
All right, fine. lf you want,
you can go in first on this one.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.904
What's that? A favor? Of course I'm
going in first. You went first last time.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.906
No... lt's simple mathematics.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.991
You either have the money,
or you don't have the money.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.660
You have the money,
l'll find you a seat on the boat.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.869
Listen to me.
You gotta listen to me.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.412
There's a bank
in Buenos Aires,

22:11.497 --> 22:14.749
at the corner of Cacao and Santa Fe!
There's a woman there...

22:19.505 --> 22:21.131
Raid!

22:22.007 --> 22:23.466
Call it.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.592
Ten.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.553
I'm going to
beat you by two.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.020
Where you going?
Where you going? I just got here.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.939
And you! Now you!

23:06.302 --> 23:08.261
Are you having fun yet?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.472
Wake up! Wake up!

23:33.746 --> 23:35.038
The Force is strong, Luke.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.816
You all right?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.111
What are you doing?
l thought you needed help.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.280
l had him.
Didn't you see I had my knife in his side?

24:09.365 --> 24:10.740
l knocked him down.
He goes on my count.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.659
You're joking me, right? Jake.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.786
l've been working on this guy for 10 minutes!

24:14.870 --> 24:16.871
Ten minutes l've been working on this guy.
You gonna come in here

24:16.956 --> 24:18.248
and just hit him on the side
of the head with a pipe?

24:18.332 --> 24:19.332
Jake.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.918
Look, you're not
taking a life.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.628
You're keeping
The Union viable,

24:23.712 --> 24:24.879
so we can
continue to give...

24:25.589 --> 24:29.008
Conquering heroes have
returned with their spoils!

24:30.844 --> 24:31.970
All right.
What do you got?

24:32.054 --> 24:35.056
Eighteen hosts.
32 forgs.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.141
Thirty-two and a half!
- Half?

24:37.226 --> 24:38.351
Midget.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.270
Little people.
Please, I have a cousin.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.107
We found a boat heading out of port.
Look at these.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.817
Two of them had
scanning jammers.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.027
We pinged them,
they read free and clear.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.197
l opened them anyway.
They had three forgs each.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.825
Stupid bastards will try anything.
Mmm.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.664
Thirty-two forgs.
Pretty impressive, boys.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.084
You ever think about doing
this on a regular basis?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.378
Spec?
Yeah!

25:05.462 --> 25:08.715
You run your own ship.
Take down these nests.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.842
Don't have to deal with me
and the pink sheets anymore.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.470
You two riding around together,
kicking ass, taking names.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.640
l can talk to Corporate,
see if they'd bump up the commissions a bit.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.059
What do you think, man?
What do you think, buddy?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.312
Forget it.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.813
Actually, Frank,

25:23.897 --> 25:25.898
l've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.110
Something...
Yeah. Forget that.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.654
Find somebody else.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.031
Just get us
our pink sheets.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.077
Suit yourself.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.131
Okay, look. Can I just
ask you something?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.466
Mmm-hmm.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.302
What do you think

25:55.471 --> 25:58.222
keeps a world like this's
shit together?

25:59.224 --> 26:01.225
lt's not magic.
lt's not.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.312
lt's rules.

26:05.939 --> 26:11.110
lt's people abiding by the terms of
the deals that they sign themselves.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.529
lt's rules.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.116
You know what's more important
than the rules, though?

26:18.077 --> 26:20.787
lt's the enforcement
of those rules.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.500
l mean, we got a responsibility,
you and me.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.002
l mean, what we do,

26:29.588 --> 26:32.298
l mean, maybe it's small,
l don't know,

26:33.967 --> 26:35.510
but it matters.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.262
lt matters.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.401
l'd actually work
less hours.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.948
You're sure about this?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.869
A job's a job,

27:01.954 --> 27:02.954
right?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.541
A job's a job.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.589
Just make sure that
they give you hazard pay.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.591
You'll be sitting next to Frank,
in some booth,

27:15.676 --> 27:17.468
telling some
cancer-riddled prick,

27:17.553 --> 27:20.221
"You owe it to your family.
You owe it to yourself."

27:20.347 --> 27:23.724
There's a good chance you'll
choke on your own vomit.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.197
You should go finish
that T-Bone job.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.490
Yeah.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.576
lt'll be your last hurrah.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.121
Get Carol a chance to blow off
some steam at the same time.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.957
You ready to go after
the Patrick Morton's?

27:48.041 --> 27:51.043
l was there this morning.
He said to say hi.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.087
You didn't do it?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.923
l did it. He said
to say hi before that.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.646
Jake's right.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.107
And if this is
going to be my last job,

28:13.192 --> 28:15.318
then they don't come
much better than Jimmy T-Bone.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.069
Every day

28:19.531 --> 28:22.700
Will be like a holiday

28:22.784 --> 28:26.287
l've been listening to his music
since I was in high school.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.414
And the way I see it,

28:28.498 --> 28:29.832
at least he's gonna get
his heart ripped out

28:29.917 --> 28:31.542
by someone who
appreciates his music.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.880
When my baby comes home

28:36.757 --> 28:38.424
lt's a nice house.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.092
Thanks.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.595
Not really mine
anymore.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.389
You from the lRS?
No.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.559
Soul suckers,
taking everything back.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.644
Mmm.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.564
So am l.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.489
Uh...

29:01.740 --> 29:03.699
Can I finish this song?

29:04.284 --> 29:05.868
Yeah. Of course.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.747
I'm a bit of a fan,
actually.

29:09.831 --> 29:13.584
Yeah? Good.
You can help me out.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.128
l don't...

29:16.630 --> 29:18.047
l don't know.
l wouldn't be much help.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.800
lt's not
that complicated.

29:20.884 --> 29:24.971
A song is just a bunch of separate tracks,
all working together.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.722
Just got to know
when to break it down.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.892
You know, pull it out,
one thing at a time.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.727
Well, I can do that.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.024
And every day, oh, yeah

29:38.318 --> 29:41.279
Will be like a holiday

29:41.363 --> 29:43.197
Oh, yes, it will

29:44.866 --> 29:46.242
When my baby

29:50.372 --> 29:54.417
When my baby comes home

29:58.380 --> 30:00.589
That's a motherfucking
hit right there.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.010
lRS will be thrilled.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.016
Can you make sure
my boy Terrance

30:10.183 --> 30:12.101
at Blue Note
Records get this?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.520
lt's done.

30:19.901 --> 30:20.985
Now,

30:23.780 --> 30:25.531
I'm legally bound

30:26.074 --> 30:28.492
to ask if you would like
an ambulance on standby,

30:28.577 --> 30:30.036
in order to take you
to the hospital.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.080
And, what,
they gonna give me a new heart?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.666
Christ, no,
not with your credit history.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.586
l know, it's a
chicken-and-egg thing.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.921
There's a
complaints department.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.633
Nah, man, nah.
Let's just...

30:46.303 --> 30:48.054
Will I sit or stand?

30:48.138 --> 30:50.056
Easier if you lie down.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.150
What the fuck
is that, man?

31:01.234 --> 31:02.735
My defib unit.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.990
Jarvik stops pumping when you
give it a jolt with electricity.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.368
Saves me from
losing my finger.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.246
Hold on, hold on. ls this...
ls this going to hurt?

31:15.665 --> 31:17.541
You won't feel a thing.

31:23.507 --> 31:27.593
l have been knocked unconscious
on four separate occasions.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.679
Knockout number one,
military training.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.264
Head back for
the concussion test.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.391
What test?

31:34.518 --> 31:37.478
Congratulations, son.
You've got a very small brain.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.897
Small brains,
big skulls.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.900
That's why they put us
in a tank.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.280
Fire-fucking-power!

31:48.365 --> 31:50.449
Target sighted!
Fire on will!

31:53.036 --> 31:54.286
That's you!

31:54.746 --> 31:57.498
Oh, shit!
lt fucking disappeared!

31:59.042 --> 32:00.084
Here, right?

32:00.168 --> 32:02.878
And then one night,
the war was over.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.798
And there we were,
all dressed up and nowhere to go.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.844
You see, for us,
the war never ended.

32:09.928 --> 32:10.928
It just changed venue.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.012
Beauty!

32:13.306 --> 32:14.306
Come on!
Come and get it!

32:15.475 --> 32:17.226
That takes care
of number two.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.147
And this

32:21.773 --> 32:23.774
is knockout number three.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.279
He's waking up.

32:28.864 --> 32:29.947
Hey.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.827
Looking good.
Looking real good.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.372
You gave us
a big scare, buddy.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.504
The client?

32:46.173 --> 32:47.506
Look at this guy.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.593
Two seconds out of a coma,
and he's worried about the pink sheet.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.011
You scare me, pal.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.180
Don't worry,
we'll get him.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.517
Carol?

33:00.145 --> 33:01.729
She left
a while back, buddy.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.856
l don't

33:05.025 --> 33:06.442
remember.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.194
Faulty shock unit.

33:08.695 --> 33:12.865
Frank's got the guys back at the
shop looking into that right now.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.957
Huh? What is it?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.710
l mean, you know that I will be here,
no matter what.

33:26.546 --> 33:30.090
l would change your fucking
diapers if you needed me to.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.846
But we got some business that
we got to discuss right now.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.598
Oh, sure. Look...

33:39.059 --> 33:43.395
Jake, he does my work
until I get back on my feet.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.191
You're a very lucky man,
you know that?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.903
What you're
looking at here

33:50.987 --> 33:54.240
is the new Jarvik 39 heart module,
top of the line.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.910
No.
Oh, yes.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.539
No, no, no.
Ten billion beat warranty.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.665
lt's got
the no-rust valves...

34:02.749 --> 34:04.250
Get it out.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.835
Get it out, Jake.
You got hit pretty hard.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.462
All you got is scar tissue
in there right now.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.505
l feel fine!

34:09.589 --> 34:11.840
'Cause the unit's already doing its work.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.092
All you have to do
is sign a few papers.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.844
They can take out the meat,
put in the new forg,

34:15.929 --> 34:17.012
sew you up
better than new.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.347
The warranty alone
on this baby...

34:18.431 --> 34:21.850
Don't you sell me.
I'm not a fucking client!

34:21.935 --> 34:23.518
Of course
you're not.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.228
You're the best Repo
in this whole damn town.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.690
But you gotta have a ticker
to play the game, am I wrong?

34:29.275 --> 34:32.735
You got to do what you got to do, buddy.
Take care of yourself.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.862
You owe it
to your family.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.408
You owe it to yourself.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.295
What? What did I say?

34:50.547 --> 34:52.464
You're an asshole, man.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.092
Sir?

34:57.387 --> 34:59.221
Sir, that's
hospital property.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.160
Buddy? Come on.
Let's go back inside, all right?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.458
Now you're just
being childish.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.588
Well, that should
take care of your pain

36:14.673 --> 36:17.800
and help the artiforg
assimilate into your body.

36:19.052 --> 36:22.638
You got it for three more days,
and then it's cold turkey.

36:44.661 --> 36:45.828
Carol?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.665
The lock's broken.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.417
My key works fine.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.420
Where are you going?

37:00.927 --> 37:02.594
That's a bit
extreme, isn't it?

37:02.679 --> 37:04.930
l told you to
make a decision.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.599
You made it when
you did another job.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.896
Can I see Peter?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.234
Come on, Carol.

37:20.530 --> 37:21.739
I'm sorry.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.213
Who's out here ringing my bell?
Damn kids.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.218
Hey, man! Get your
convalescent ass in here.

37:45.555 --> 37:46.930
Thanks again
for this, yeah?

37:46.973 --> 37:49.600
You're home, man.
You're home. Yeah. Yeah.

37:50.727 --> 37:51.977
And your timing's
perfect, all right?

37:52.061 --> 37:53.395
15 minutes,
the game starts.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.314
Remember that Chinese
chick from downstairs?

37:55.398 --> 37:56.398
Yeah.
Her.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.609
Well, she's coming up
to watch the game,

37:58.818 --> 38:00.319
and she's bringing
a friend.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.157
And her friend is hot.
I'm giving her to you.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.243
But can I just say
one thing, though?

38:08.328 --> 38:11.497
This place here
is the happy, happy room.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.749
Listen. You know, man,
l'd love to hang out,

38:13.833 --> 38:15.876
but I think it's better
if I just sleep.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.753
Great.
You wanna sleep? Yeah.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.130
No problem.
But one other thing.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.381
What?

38:24.844 --> 38:27.095
The guys all
missed you so much,

38:27.180 --> 38:29.765
we thought we'd get you
a little welcome-back present.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.226
l'd like to introduce
Harry the Heart.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.488
Hello!

39:30.702 --> 39:32.119
What are you
doing in my house?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.538
Mr. Erikson,
I'm from The Union.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.336
Stop! No!

40:49.322 --> 40:51.073
All hail the
conquering hero!

40:51.616 --> 40:52.950
- Hey.
- Nice.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.743
Welcome back.
Big stuff.

40:55.912 --> 40:56.870
You gonna keep me
in suspense,

40:56.955 --> 40:57.913
or you gonna tell me
the details?

40:58.039 --> 41:00.123
What happened?
lt was standard. Standard job.

41:01.125 --> 41:05.462
lt was easy. You know,
the usual. Pleading, a few tears.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.008
Oh, man,
l had this guy last week, right?

41:10.093 --> 41:12.844
As soon as the guy sees me,
he starts bawling like a little girl.

41:13.638 --> 41:17.140
And this snot bubble,
it starts growing out of his nose.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.352
And the more he cried,
the bigger it got.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.687
Bigger and smaller,
bigger and smaller. He's like...

41:22.981 --> 41:24.731
I'm like, "Whoa!
Okay." I'm like,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.233
"Whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down."

41:26.317 --> 41:28.068
Listening to Jake
swapping stories

41:28.152 --> 41:30.904
about some schmuck
and his overdue liver,

41:30.989 --> 41:33.782
all I can think about is how
that schmuck has a name

41:34.909 --> 41:36.034
and a wife

41:36.953 --> 41:37.953
and kids.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.427
Hey, Peanut.
Hey.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.471
How are you?
Good.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.851
How's school?

42:01.519 --> 42:02.519
Okay, I guess.

42:02.603 --> 42:03.603
Only okay?

42:07.942 --> 42:09.109
Peter.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.361
Go inside.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.196
You listen to your mum.
Go back inside.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.532
Okay.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.788
lt'd be good to talk.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.040
Carol.

42:24.584 --> 42:25.751
Carol!

42:27.670 --> 42:30.672
lf I could come in
for just a minute...

42:38.598 --> 42:39.848
Something

42:42.060 --> 42:43.268
changed.

42:52.612 --> 42:56.448
Frank just called.
He said you never turned in that pink.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.660
You told me there was
no problem, right?

43:02.663 --> 43:05.415
You said that there was...
lt was an easy job.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.210
Right?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.802
Hey, hey,
l get it, I get it.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.555
No problem. I understand.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.477
l mean, everybody
needs a break, right?

43:27.063 --> 43:29.523
No time at all,
you're gonna be back on your game.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.525
You're gonna be
knocking them dead.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.777
Mr. Timmons,

43:36.781 --> 43:39.449
you owe it to your family,
you owe it to yourself.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.619
l made some moussaka.

43:42.703 --> 43:45.413
l want you to try
this béchamel sauce.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.791
I'm falling behind
on payments.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.630
l really need
to make some cash.

43:54.590 --> 43:55.882
Do what you got to do.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.761
Gotta make
some money, right?

43:59.846 --> 44:00.929
Yeah.

44:01.848 --> 44:04.683
But you get it out of your system.
All right?

44:06.144 --> 44:07.853
Of course, if you
can't pay the bills,

44:07.937 --> 44:10.564
some Union man will break into your
house in the middle of the night,

44:10.648 --> 44:12.941
slice you open from the collarbone
to the pelvis with a scalpel

44:13.025 --> 44:14.317
and reclaim
our property.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.904
I'm just saying.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.324
Clearly, I'm not
cut out for sales.

44:21.409 --> 44:24.411
And this new heart's accumulating
interest with every beat.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.079
Hello. Uh,
can we have your liver?

44:26.164 --> 44:29.207
Most people don't know
when they're gonna die.

44:29.292 --> 44:32.252
I have exactly
six days, three hours

44:32.336 --> 44:34.796
and between 20
and 30 minutes,

44:35.173 --> 44:38.341
depending on how punctual
my Repo Man is feeling.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.346
It's amazing how fast
90 days go by.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.016
Fuck!

45:06.120 --> 45:08.371
We're supposed
to be partners.

45:08.789 --> 45:12.042
And you're just fucking up our shit.
You know that?

45:13.586 --> 45:15.795
You're fucking up
everything.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.631
Don't you see that?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.346
We've always
been lucky here.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.348
The metal graveyard's
a fucking treasure chest.

45:26.432 --> 45:28.141
Thirty minutes,
you're going to be back on top.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.309
You're gonna see,
all right?

45:32.146 --> 45:33.813
lt's a black hole.

45:35.191 --> 45:36.816
That's all it is.

46:08.724 --> 46:12.519
There it is, on a platter.
Esophagus. Five months over.

46:15.481 --> 46:18.316
Okay, no, you're not
ready to do a kid.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.486
Fine, fine.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.288
Hey, hey,
where are you going?

46:38.379 --> 46:40.088
Liver and kidneys.

46:41.757 --> 46:43.216
You want me to start?

46:43.801 --> 46:44.884
All right, Jake.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.652
You've done this
a thousand times!

47:03.779 --> 47:06.114
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

47:07.074 --> 47:09.492
You stay right here

47:11.454 --> 47:13.413
until you get this done.

47:14.790 --> 47:16.166
Then you find
another one.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.252
You find another one.
You get as many as you can.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.130
l want you to
get over this hump.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.761
You do this.

48:07.384 --> 48:08.885
Part of me,

48:09.762 --> 48:10.970
most of me,

48:11.138 --> 48:13.056
doesn't mind too much
if this is how it ends.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.684
'Cause it's over anyway.

48:18.062 --> 48:21.564
For those still counting,
this is knockout number four.

48:34.578 --> 48:40.375
Well, you can cry me a river

48:43.212 --> 48:48.049
Cry me a river

48:48.384 --> 48:53.429
I cried a river over you

48:56.934 --> 49:02.397
Now you say you're sorry

49:04.650 --> 49:08.653
For being so untrue

49:08.737 --> 49:09.821
Miss?

49:12.199 --> 49:15.660
Well, you can cry

49:15.744 --> 49:16.786
Miss?

49:16.871 --> 49:18.413
me a river

49:20.958 --> 49:22.709
Cry me...

49:22.793 --> 49:24.377
Hey, where did you
hear that song?

49:24.461 --> 49:25.461
Miss?

49:28.883 --> 49:29.883
Miss?

49:31.385 --> 49:33.428
How do you know
that song?

49:37.016 --> 49:40.643
And dream of days we...

49:41.604 --> 49:42.979
l know you.

49:50.571 --> 49:53.615
In three days,
they can legally come take my heart.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.786
I may not be making
the best use of my time.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.298
Two days of withdrawal.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.886
It's not like I can't see
the dirt or the scars

50:14.970 --> 50:16.888
or the Q stains
on her lips.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.266
I should leave.

50:21.644 --> 50:23.770
But for some reason, I can't.

50:41.330 --> 50:44.332
I saw an interview
with a serial killer once.

50:45.501 --> 50:49.045
Said it took him six years
to work up to his first kill.

50:50.589 --> 50:53.508
The second, a year.
The third, just a week.

50:55.094 --> 50:57.804
Once that dam broke,
it was a flood.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.391
Making people die,

51:02.434 --> 51:04.269
it had become second nature.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.274
Apparently, it also works
the other way round.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.724
How you feeling?

51:46.228 --> 51:47.312
Stop!

51:48.314 --> 51:49.856
Stop! Stop it!

51:53.527 --> 51:55.153
l didn't ask
for your help!

52:06.915 --> 52:10.168
What did you want me to do,
leave you on the street?

52:27.936 --> 52:29.812
You're as fucked as me.

52:35.527 --> 52:36.861
Maybe not.

52:47.998 --> 52:51.918
lt took me a while,
but I think I finally understood

52:52.002 --> 52:54.796
why the scientist
put the cat in the box.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.341
He was trying to
tell us something.

52:59.468 --> 53:01.010
We're all alive.

53:01.637 --> 53:03.179
We're all dead.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.515
We're all that cat.

53:06.809 --> 53:09.018
But we have to make a choice.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.605
We either purr
and lick ourselves

53:12.689 --> 53:14.690
and wait for the poison
to put us down

53:16.652 --> 53:18.736
or we scream and scratch

53:19.029 --> 53:22.031
and claw our way right out
of the top of that damn box.

53:36.422 --> 53:39.257
You get nine hearts
when I wasn't looking?

53:42.970 --> 53:46.139
My uncle was a bank robber.
l ever tell you that?

53:46.890 --> 53:48.850
Made a mess
of the west coast,

53:48.934 --> 53:51.310
knocking over savings
and loans, you know.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.938
And he was good
at it.

53:54.898 --> 53:57.233
Nobody ever knew
a damn thing.

53:57.317 --> 53:59.819
He thought
he was home free.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.654
He woke up
in the morning,

54:01.738 --> 54:04.031
went to work
at the auto shop.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.908
But every once
in a while,

54:06.910 --> 54:11.873
he'd skip out for lunch,
pull on a ski mask, rob a bank.

54:14.209 --> 54:17.378
Then one day, the cops
came knocking at his door.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.839
Let me guess.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.217
He was relieved.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.138
No, he was
fucking pissed.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.558
He went soft.

54:32.227 --> 54:33.603
He was off his game.

54:34.563 --> 54:35.563
And he knew it.

54:38.108 --> 54:41.277
Who do you think Frank's gonna send after me?
Ray?

54:43.071 --> 54:44.530
Probably Ray.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.700
l don't know.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.161
Maybe me.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.209
Mmm.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.960
A job's a job.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.297
You still believe that?

55:45.050 --> 55:46.217
Peter?

55:47.928 --> 55:49.387
Peter.

55:49.471 --> 55:50.930
Dad?
Yeah.

55:53.559 --> 55:55.184
Hey, listen,
I'm going away for a while.

55:56.478 --> 55:59.647
It means I won't be able to
pick you up on Saturdays.

55:59.731 --> 56:02.692
But I'll think about you
every day that goes by.

56:06.488 --> 56:08.239
See you
on Saturday.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.208
What happened?

56:20.502 --> 56:21.877
We got to leave.

56:22.170 --> 56:23.337
What?

56:23.422 --> 56:26.215
l got caught trying
to clear your forgs.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.886
Now they'll want to know
where the rest of them are.

56:32.848 --> 56:34.307
You're clear.

56:34.850 --> 56:38.436
You can leave me here.
l'll be fine on my own. lt's okay.

56:39.438 --> 56:42.231
l did yours first.
l didn't get to mine.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.072
Are you coming?

57:36.578 --> 57:39.372
The thing is,
l have an artificial heart,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.835
and she has an artificial
everything else.

57:46.755 --> 57:49.548
Maybe we're two parts
of the same puzzle.

57:52.678 --> 57:55.596
Maybe it's not just her
I'm trying to save.

58:26.336 --> 58:28.254
Why you giving this to me?

58:28.338 --> 58:30.673
l figured you'd
want the option.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.259
Was I wrong?

58:36.847 --> 58:38.848
Give it to
somebody else.

58:48.316 --> 58:49.692
You want it?

59:23.852 --> 59:26.270
Didn't your eyes
used to be brown?

59:31.526 --> 59:35.362
Opticor 202, with
kaleidoscope enhancement.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.117
How do you keep track of all
those things you've got in there?

59:42.788 --> 59:44.121
Let's see.

59:47.375 --> 59:50.002
Pancreas and kidneys
from the diabetes.

59:50.086 --> 59:52.296
One went bad
outside warranty.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.673
l had to go black market
on the replacement.

59:55.884 --> 59:59.762
Liver, stomach and lungs,
thanks to Q habit.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.061
Knee from
the car accident.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:12.274
Upgrades. l've got
eyes, ears, voice box.

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:19.949
Jackson Reproductive Replacement System,
release 5.3.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:24.036
Lady Mystique model.
Comes in six sparkling colors.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.204
Stop.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:30.376
Flexor Dura-Joints.
Billion step warranty.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.585
Stop.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.465
Ask me about my lips.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.890
What brand
are your lips?

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.728
They're all me.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.176
Happy birthday.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.182
lt's not
my birthday.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.728
Birthday.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.194
Happy birthday.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.256
l didn't get you
anything.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:00.841
Yeah, you did.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.659
There was a man
from Troubadour

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.703
who got blown up
during the war.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:32.915
He did not die,
would not concede.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.834
So what is it
I'm writing?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.673
It's not just
some crappy memoir

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.301
or even an attempt at apologizing
for everything I've done.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.597
This is a cautionary tale.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.810
I hope that you might learn
from my mistakes.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.062
'Cause in the end,

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:57.106
a job is not just a job.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.900
It's who you are.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.695
And if you want to change
who you are,

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.655
well, first,

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.533
you have to change
what you do.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:11.120
There was a man
from Troubadour

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:14.623
who got blown up
during the war.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:18.585
He did not die,
would not concede.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:22.131
How many artiforgs
did he need?

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.882
Here.
Thanks.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:28.429
Stomach, bladder,
pancreas, eyes, intestines.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.350
So, what is it?
A novel? Epic poem?

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:34.685
Thoughts.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.812
lt's just

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.232
stuff.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.067
And it's not finished.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.655
What?

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.202
Somebody's coming.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.374
You don't hear it?

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.301
What are you doing?

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:13.682
Put them on.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.939
...who got blown
up during the war.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.651
He did not die,
would not concede.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.154
How many artiforgs
did he need?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.782
Stomach, bladder,
pancreas,

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:34.787
eyes, intestines, liver,
blood, guts, head!

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.705
Get down!

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.208
Who's that?

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.960
Landlord, come
to collect.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.921
Grab the
typewriter!

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.716
There's a fire escape.
No, no! Downstairs.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:09.071
What the fuck is this?
This is bullshit.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.074
l thought you were
a Level Five.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.202
Quite honest,
I'm...

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.788
I'm a little
disappointed.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:20.999
You're disappointed?

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.752
They sent the ear guy after me,
imagine how I feel.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:27.047
That's a good one.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.883
You'll be laughing out of the
other side of your mouth

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.427
when I have your
heart in my hand.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.867
Shit. Beth! Get back!

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.327
Beth!

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.954
No!

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.541
Fuck!

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.252
Shit.

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:10.507
Oh, shit!

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.219
lt hurts!
Beth, get out of there.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.513
Come on, get out!

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.912
Welcome back.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.664
Whose car is this?

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:45.792
The landlord's.
l borrowed it.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.591
You're leaking quite
a bit of fluid there.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.176
l can fix it.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:57.971
Where are we going?

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.182
We're gonna pick up
some supplies.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.686
Where'd you find
all that stuff?

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.773
When you're on the streets long enough, babe...

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.659
There.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:34.466
"What do you do for a living?"
"I'm a fucking lung. Can you believe that shit?

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.051
"lt's ridiculous, right?"

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.887
Great example
he's setting.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.182
You all right?

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:43.976
Never been better.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.061
l'll be
five minutes.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:50.565
Attention,
shoppers. This month only...

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.693
Hey, Larry.
Hi, Larry!

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:57.572
Hi, Larry!

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.408
Watch it, kid.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.081
lf you ever want
to make Repo,

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.457
keep your fucking
head up.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.301
What the fuck
do you want?

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.479
Afternoon, boss.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.069
l should have given you
that lung job.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.613
You look good
in that thing.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.992
Yeah? lt itches
like a motherfucker.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.120
Yeah, that's what
the kid said, too.

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.081
Nice Taser.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.292
Yours?
No.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.170
Nor is that.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.256
l'll do that
to the next one.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.426
The one after.
The one after that.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.844
l guarantee, you'll
run out of Repo Men

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.345
before I run out of ways
of killing them.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.848
Great, great.
This is just great.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.267
Do you have any idea what
this makes me look like?

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.478
One of my own guys
jumping credit, huh?

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:10.687
Yeah.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.357
Now take me
out of the system.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.442
Fine. Give me
your heart.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.612
l said take me
out of the system.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:21.823
And I said give me
your goddamn heart.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.326
For Christ's sake,
you sound like one of them,

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.203
whining and begging.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.788
There is no way out of the system!
You screwed that up

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:32.042
when you pulled your little
stunt with the bar codes!

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.420
Yeah! That's right,
Einstein!

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.631
They pulled all
the local scanners!

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:41.468
Now every artiforg reclaim has
to go back to the main office,

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.303
get scanned in
behind the pink door!

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.471
So, unless you're thinking
about breaking into Corporate,

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:48.058
give me
your fucking heart!

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.560
Or,

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.565
and there is
an option here,

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.986
we could sit down
and talk this out.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.489
You know,
maybe come up with a plan that fits your...

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.633
We're leaving.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.468
Where are we going?

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.097
Kenya. South America.
Anywhere The Union isn't.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.933
The airport?

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.728
No one gets out through the airport.
lt's impossible.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.025
Not with these.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.127
l don't get it.
How'd he get in here?

01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.046
He was wearing
the damn lung costume.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:05.427
I'm glad you
find this amusing,

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.970
'cause now
he's yours.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:09.973
Where's my
goddamn shirt, huh?

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.435
A job's a job, right?

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.525
Your attention, please.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.943
Hold there.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:24.196
Forward. Thank you. Now boarding,
Flight 2701 to São Paulo, Brazil

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
Sir?

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.533
Forward,
please. Hold there.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.579
If you are a passenger on that flight,
please proceed to Gate 29.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:33.663
Thank you.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.586
What if it
doesn't work?

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.463
lt has to work.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.256
Should I check it?
No. No.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.842
You really don't want to be
found with a jammer in here.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.390
l looked at him.
- Huh?

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.142
l looked at him.
Shit.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.561
A little holiday?

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:58.480
Uh, funeral.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:10.033
You done with that?

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:11.368
Have a nice day.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:25.549
Thank you.
Forward, please.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.134
Hold there.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.266
Thank you.
Forward.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.310
Sir, forward,
please.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.729
Hold there.

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.901
Thank you.
Forward.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:48.572
That was fun.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.284
Thank you.
- Honey, look.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.412
Excuse me, miss?
Your leg's bleeding.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.208
Come on.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.003
Ma'am, do you need
some assistance?

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:04.504
I'm okay. Thank you.
She's fine. Thanks.

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.340
We can't let you fly like this.
Sorry?

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.009
Sir, there's blood
all over the floor.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:10.760
We need to get her cleaned up.
I'm fine, really.

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.263
ls that really necessary?
The quicker we get this done,

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.556
the quicker you can
get on the plane.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.600
l promise you,
she's all right. Let's go.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:18.184
This way, please. Come on.

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:23.898
We still gonna make the plane?
Absolutely.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.778
These tickets refundable?
l have no idea, sir.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.782
So when's
the last boarding, then?

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.242
l don't know, sir.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.670
Okay, let's take a look at that leg.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.589
Doctor told her
to take it easy.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.923
She doesn't listen
to anyone.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.013
lt's okay.
lt happens all the time.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:21.039
That's him.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:24.709
You don't want
to do that.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:29.923
Everybody's got to be
a fucking hero.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:27.689
We got to dump this car,
get you a new kneecap. Hold on.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.987
l know someone who can help.
He's outside the Union.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.155
ls he a vulture?

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.698
We don't have any choice.

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.784
Believe me,
it's the last place I want to go.

01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:45.165
This is a bad idea.

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:50.628
He always left me
a key up here.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:52.964
How well did you
know this guy?

01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:15.904
I gave her my loving
She gave me blue balls

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.198
I gave her my money...

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.325
Put it away.
Put it away.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:23.578
l gave her
the thing a man...

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.038
Asbury.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.959
Little, little
Miss Muffet.

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:31.085
Don't call me that.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.258
We need your help.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.347
Why'd you have to
drag me a U-man, huh?

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.098
I'm not with them anymore.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.268
Why? Did you quit
or was he quitted?

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.607
Got my cookies?

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.400
Yeah, I got
your cookies.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.993
Don't touch
anything, U-man.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.288
Come on,
stop your whining.

01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:10.667
l was thinking of you
when I tweaked this.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:16.297
He always left me a key up here... Asbury...
Don't call me that.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:20.760
Universal remote. Vocal auto-playback
with an eight-hour buffer, man.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.555
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be a head-blaster at all the parties.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.931
Mark my words.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.516
l see you haven't changed.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.768
Well, no, I haven't.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.104
Have you?

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:04.637
You pay
for these?

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:05.888
What'd you say?

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:07.348
Did you pay for these?

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:08.683
Pay for yours?

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.767
That's different.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.686
Yeah, how's that different, U-man, huh?

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.189
I'm Robin Hood, baby.
I'm Jesus, I'm Gandhi.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:19.861
l can lift the valve from some fresh
meat and then drop it in a new client

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:23.489
for half the cost. Bottom line,
l don't kill my clients.

01:18:23.907 --> 01:18:25.199
l wait for them to die.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.660
What do you do to your clients when
you're finished with them, huh?

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.203
Chop them up for dog meat?
You know what?

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:31.039
You got your own thoughts, huh?
Company parrot?

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.665
l'd rather be a fucking parrot... Parrot!

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.834
...than a fucking vulture!
Fucking vulture! Parrot! Parrot!

01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:36.711
You think you're the solution, man?
You're the problem!

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.046
I'm the problem?
You're the fucking problem!

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:41.924
Hey! When the pissing
contest is over,

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.178
may I have some help?

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.611
So what do you want me to do? You want
me to put you two on the boat, is that it?

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:04.947
Yeah. But I can't run
if I can't walk.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.827
I'm sorry, baby,
l just don't fly with joints anymore.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:11.996
We're gonna have to switch
over to Alva for that insertion.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.414
That bitch
almost killed me.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:16.084
Well, that's your side
of the fairytale, isn't it?

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:20.088
But l'll tell you something. lt warms my
cock that you're still sore about that.

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:29.889
Have a seat.

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:42.110
Another one, Mom?
- Yeah, baby, another one.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:43.945
So let Mama
work a minute.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.614
That's Little Alva.

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:48.658
Hey.
Hello.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:50.535
Before we start,

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.996
I'm gonna need to know
about all your other artiforgs.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.374
What do you mean?
You put most of them in.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.000
Beth, humor me.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.089
Ears, Vocar.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:05.383
Opticor eyes.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:10.430
My liver is a Hexa-Tan from a
specialty house in Denmark.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.810
My kidneys are actually
two different models.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.021
One is a Union generic.

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:20.565
The other one

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.736
didn't
hold up so well.

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:29.657
Lord, I thought she was
gonna go on forever.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:33.202
Wait. Don't you need her
to tell you the rest?

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:37.457
Nah, that's just my version of "Count
back from 100." All right, baby, you're up.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.877
What are we doing?
- A new knee.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.295
What? She's the surgeon?

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.881
Yeah, I just do
anesthesia these days.

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.216
The little one's
got the steadier hand.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:48.384
She's five!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.094
She's nine, actually,

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.262
but she's been doing this
since she was four.

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:53.389
Ain't that right, pumpkin? Shh!

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:19.916
l almost got it.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:23.419
Yay!

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.968
l feel like
break dancing.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.887
Go on, then.
Hop along.

01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:40.228
Wait.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:47.443
Stay here.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.362
Beth, let's
get out of here.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.499
All right, all right, all right,
I'm coming. U-man number two, huh?

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:44.709
Man, you guys regen
like a cancer...

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:45.877
Beth.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.045
All right...

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.885
lt just goes on
like that for awhile.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:57.889
How'd you find us?

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:02.143
Found you the same way
you would have found me.

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:14.322
l see what's
going on here.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:17.533
l get this.
l get it. I do.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:21.454
But I can make this right with Frank.

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:24.749
All you got to do is you
got to come back with me.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:26.917
Beth, wait there.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.296
l'll deal with you later.
l'll deal with you later.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:33.966
No.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.135
l can't go back.

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:38.137
That's who
you are, man.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:39.972
That's who you are.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.225
Not anymore.
Not since the accident.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.603
There you go again
with the accident!

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:47.813
lf I had known that you were going to be such a

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.149
pussy
about the accident...

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:52.151
What?

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.278
What, you thought
it was fate?

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.865
Sort of karmic plan to get
you right with the world?

01:23:57.949 --> 01:23:59.659
ls that
what you thought?

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:00.910
Jake...
Let me tell you,

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.078
the cosmos,
it doesn't know shit

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.788
about swapping out
electrical leads.

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.336
You rigged
the defib unit.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:15.883
Didn't you?

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.011
For what?

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:23.349
So l'd build up debt so l
wouldn't transfer to sales?

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:26.602
You're not a salesman, man!
You never would've been. You never could be!

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:30.356
All you had to do was
just to keep working.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.316
You and me,
doing our thing.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:36.487
You're fucking crazy,
do you know that?

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:40.908
You could have
killed me.

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.577
l tried to
save your life.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:49.333
I'm not going with you.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.584
Well, I'm not
letting you go.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:14.358
God!

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:27.997
God.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.351
Let's go, buddy.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.523
No!

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:24.572
You owe it
to yourself.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:29.285
You've done this
a thousand times!

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.954
Buddy, you and me,
we're always gonna be Repo.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.625
- Stay with me.
- Always.

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.211
There is no way out of the system!
You screwed that up

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.088
when you pulled your little
stunt with the bar codes!

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:42.673
Hey, wake up.

01:27:43.466 --> 01:27:44.717
Wake up.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.469
Come on, get up.

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:52.892
You okay?

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.311
Uh-uh.

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:57.187
We got to go.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.982
Raid! Repo!

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.734
Raid, raid!

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:03.235
Go! Go! Go!

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.528
Raid!

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:08.490
Fuck!

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.342
Help me! Please, help!

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:09.760
Where'd they go?

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.201
Singing my favorite song.

01:29:34.285 --> 01:29:35.411
Okay.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.087
Wait.
Back off!

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.425
Give me one reason

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.760
why I shouldn't
pull this trigger.

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:27.880
Welcome to your
world, Repo Man.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.123
Come back inside.

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:48.669
We can stay here
until we find a way out.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.712
There is no way out.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.756
Stop, please.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.718
There is no way out.

01:31:57.595 --> 01:31:59.096
Not for anyone.

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:03.892
Wherever we go,
wherever we hide, they'll find us.

01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:06.103
That's what they do.
That's what I did.

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.734
What do you
want to do?

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:18.532
Finish this.

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.706
Okay, so we go to headquarters
and find the pink door...

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.709
We go to headquarters,
we find the pink door, we wipe the system.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:30.544
No more accounts.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:31.879
Nobody's overdue.

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:34.548
That's easy.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.383
Here he is.
Hmm?

01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:37.593
Peanut.
Dad!

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.183
Thanks for bringing him.
l can't believe you let it get this far.

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:46.351
Just let me have
a minute with my son.

01:32:48.479 --> 01:32:49.813
Who's she?

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.276
Carol, shall we do this on the train?

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.069
Come on.

01:33:00.867 --> 01:33:02.784
Frank and Jake are calling
me three times a day,

01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:03.952
trying to find you.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:05.078
l haven't got time
for this.

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:06.413
All I'm asking for is a few minutes with Peter.

01:33:06.497 --> 01:33:07.581
Do you think
I'm having a good time

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:10.042
trying to raise him on my own?
Mom! Dad.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.418
Peter, I'm talking!

01:33:11.502 --> 01:33:12.794
l didn't have
a fucking choice!

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:15.088
You think I wanted to just
walk away from the situation?

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:16.131
Give me a moment
with my son.

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:17.382
Oh, I'm sure
that's exactly what you like,

01:33:17.467 --> 01:33:20.510
for your problems to just walk
away and just disappear.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:21.595
That's not...

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:31.104
Peter!

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.318
That was
very naughty.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.363
Very, very naughty
what you just did.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:41.698
Come on, come on,
we gotta go.

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:45.827
When you're old enough,
you read this.

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:48.288
And if you still want to see your old man,
l'll be in Punta del Este.

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:50.874
Can you say that?
Punta del Este.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.179
l love you.
Look after your mum.

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:23.824
Hi.

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:28.745
Come on. Again?

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.055
So, what's the plan?

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.517
Wait here.

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:52.936
My feet are
always freezing.

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.022
What? The cotton socks
don't work?

01:34:57.025 --> 01:35:00.444
l always wear cotton socks.
Hey, who's this guy?

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.281
Sir, this is
a restricted area.

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:20.380
lt's all about
who you know.

01:35:25.928 --> 01:35:29.097
So what is it,
bright pink or pale pink?

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:32.142
l don't know.
You see a pink door, you go for it.

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:35.937
Let's go.

01:36:09.555 --> 01:36:10.555
Come on.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:34.579
Oi!

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:35.664
Come on.

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:37.124
Oi!

01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:04.609
This is it?

01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:09.156
Oh, shit.

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:10.657
Union men.
What are we going to do?

01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:19.124
Fuck.

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.376
Grab the ax.

01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:23.003
Freeze!

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.505
- Don't move!
- Drop it now!

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.675
Your weapons!
Drop your weapons! Do it now!

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.337
Anyone comes through
that door, kill them.

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:11.236
Hacksaw!

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:14.466
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.009
This is not a drill.

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:17.552
Have a nice day.

01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:22.724
Go on.
Make a delivery.

01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:27.437
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:42.494
Beth!

01:40:45.164 --> 01:40:46.164
Beth!

01:40:50.252 --> 01:40:53.171
Great! That's just
fucking great!

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:10.730
There's no keyboard.

01:41:12.108 --> 01:41:14.025
There's no keyboard.
So?

01:41:14.485 --> 01:41:17.195
So, if there's no keyboard,
how can I get into the system?

01:41:17.279 --> 01:41:18.446
How do I wipe
the accounts?

01:41:18.531 --> 01:41:20.615
Maybe there's a different way.
Using what?

01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:22.367
l don't know.
An interface or something.

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.828
Look at it, Beth,
it's a scanner. That's it.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.871
Even if we were just...
l mean, we...

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:28.998
The only...

01:41:30.835 --> 01:41:32.252
The only way out
of the system...

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:33.711
ls what?

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:37.590
The only way out of the
system is to repo ourselves.

01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.260
Can't get in
without a forg.

01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:43.763
We're surrounded
by the fucking things.

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:48.434
Please make your way to the nearest exit.
This is not a drill.

01:41:50.312 --> 01:41:51.938
You're kidding, right?

01:41:53.732 --> 01:41:54.941
Stop it.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.153
No. Stop it.

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:01.948
No!
Beth.

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:03.658
We'll die.
Beth.

01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:05.743
We can fight
our way back out.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:08.079
We didn't come all this way to run back out.

01:42:12.209 --> 01:42:13.251
Help me.

01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:33.646
Wait.

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:52.749
l can't.

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:56.586
Beth.

01:42:57.963 --> 01:43:00.173
l can't dance
the mambo alone.

01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:34.249
Please deposit one artiforg
in reclaim drawer.

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:35.625
Have a nice day.

01:43:38.796 --> 01:43:41.714
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:43.466
This is not a drill.

01:43:44.134 --> 01:43:45.718
Have a nice day.

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:48.966
Stay with me.

01:45:49.885 --> 01:45:51.094
Always.

01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:17.578
Stay with me.

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.039
Only one left,
all right?

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:22.083
Only one left.

01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:25.545
Don't go now.

01:46:31.009 --> 01:46:32.552
What are
you doing?

01:46:32.636 --> 01:46:34.220
I'm losing her.

01:46:36.014 --> 01:46:39.976
There's only one left.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.979
Oh, Jesus,
this is fucking pathetic. Finish it.

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:48.526
Stay with me!

01:46:50.863 --> 01:46:52.697
ls it really
worth it?

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:57.160
ls she really
worth it?

01:46:58.328 --> 01:47:07.044
She's worth
every job we ever did.

01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:17.889
End it, Jake.

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:20.183
Now.

01:47:25.856 --> 01:47:27.440
All right, then.

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:31.194
Enough of this bullshit.
l'll do it myself.

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:45.374
Beth.

01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:50.379
Give her a shot.

01:47:51.381 --> 01:47:53.216
Just give her a shot.

01:48:06.855 --> 01:48:10.399
We're out.

01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:13.986
Please deposit 11 artiforgs
in reclaim drawer.

01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:15.696
Have a nice day.

01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:17.823
We're not out
yet, buddy.

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.408
Not yet.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:24.956
Scorched earth.
Just like you told the kid.

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:27.917
Romans...
They were some badasses.

01:48:39.805 --> 01:48:43.140
Artiforg not recognized.
Lockdown in effect.

01:48:43.225 --> 01:48:45.893
An administrator
will be with you shortly.

01:48:45.978 --> 01:48:47.603
Have a nice day.

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:39.947
Every day

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.952
Will be like a holiday

01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:46.037
Mmm.

01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:51.167
Christ, it's hot.

01:49:52.377 --> 01:49:54.045
lt's the tropics.

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:56.756
Yeah, I know.

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.383
lt's hot.

01:50:06.558 --> 01:50:10.728
Are you going to stay here and act macho,
or come and have some fun?

01:50:11.396 --> 01:50:13.898
Christ, it's hot. Huh?

01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:18.569
Macho.

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:34.835
Sounds kind of fruity.

01:50:36.922 --> 01:50:38.547
Peter had it published.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:40.466
"An instant classic.

01:50:40.926 --> 01:50:45.596
"The depths of this author's
insights are astonishing."

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:55.940
Am I in this?

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:08.035
What's happening?

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.704
It's just a glitch.
It'll sort itself out.

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:15.126
There. All better.

01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:21.298
See? His endorphins are up,
limbic system's running strong.

01:51:23.468 --> 01:51:24.719
Hey, hey, you guys
take it easy.

01:51:24.803 --> 01:51:25.803
l want him to be
comfortable. All right?

01:51:25.887 --> 01:51:28.514
Yes, sir.
Nothing to worry about.

01:51:28.598 --> 01:51:29.890
lf that hook had
hit him any lower,

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:31.058
it might have
posed a problem.

01:51:31.143 --> 01:51:33.477
The M.5 Neural Net
is top of the line.

01:51:34.813 --> 01:51:36.814
What's he thinking about?

01:51:37.107 --> 01:51:38.649
No way to know.

01:51:38.817 --> 01:51:41.944
Yeah, but he's
happy right now.

01:51:42.237 --> 01:51:44.196
As long as someone's
paying for the system.

01:51:44.281 --> 01:51:46.407
There's 50 commissions right there.
That'll take care of his heart,

01:51:46.491 --> 01:51:49.285
that'll take care of the
down payment on the M.5.

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:51.328
The Union can dock my pay for the rest.

01:51:52.664 --> 01:51:54.331
Hey, sir. Sir!

01:51:55.125 --> 01:51:56.709
This one's
still alive.

01:51:56.793 --> 01:51:58.711
Leave her.
l'll take care of her.

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.005
Hold.

01:52:08.597 --> 01:52:10.389
Sweet dreams, buddy.

01:52:13.852 --> 01:52:15.728
For extensive
neurological injuries,

01:52:15.812 --> 01:52:17.855
l'd have to recommend
the M.5 Neural Net.

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:20.149
We're running a special
on it this month,

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:23.527
18% for the first year,
24% after that.

01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:28.073
Why should your loved one pass on
just because of a little brain damage?

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.325
That's barbaric.

01:52:29.743 --> 01:52:31.243
That's just bad science.

01:52:34.039 --> 01:52:39.251
With the M.5 Neural Net,
yesterday's dreams are today's reality.

01:52:43.715 --> 01:52:46.675
Imagine your loved ones living
out the rest of their natural lives

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:50.304
in a world where they are always happy,
always content,

01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:52.932
and always taken care of.

01:52:55.644 --> 01:52:57.102
You owe it to your family.

01:52:57.896 --> 01:52:59.438
You owe it to yourself.

01:53:00.023 --> 01:53:02.233
A little fruit
for the fruit?

01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:06.570
Why not?

01:53:07.656 --> 01:53:08.656
Cheers.
