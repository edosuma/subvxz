the kings of egypt.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.609
Pharaohs, they're called.

19:38.645 --> 19:42.480
Like that king tut they found
living inside a pyramid.

19:42.515 --> 19:48.386
He's a mummy, so...
Dead, I think.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.288
Of course. Yeah.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.424
Well, no, he wasn't "living in,"
he was laying in.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.427
Why, sometimes my mouth says
just the strangest things.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.229
Oh, shoot. I've got to fly.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.564
Now, will you just
put some things away,

19:59.599 --> 20:01.566
so that when I come home tonight
I don't feel like

20:01.601 --> 20:04.235
jumping out the window
with everything such a jumble?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.637
Uh, do you want me
to wash these dishes?

20:06.673 --> 20:08.673
Oh, would you?
That'd be swell.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.310
Oh, and while you're at it,
my room's just down the hallway.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.479
So if you're doing dishes, you
might as well clean the sheets.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.582
(quietly):
Sheets.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.652
(door creaks, closes)

20:23.590 --> 20:26.357
-what's in there?
-Oh, never you mind about that.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.625
Now, like I said,

20:27.660 --> 20:30.428
there's, uh, there's
french-playing records

20:30.463 --> 20:32.697
just by the hi-fi, and, uh,

20:32.732 --> 20:36.334
yeah, you can borrow
any book you like.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.269
How much?

20:38.304 --> 20:39.470
How much what?

20:39.505 --> 20:41.539
The way I see it,
this whole place--

20:41.574 --> 20:44.442
sheets, dishes,
three hours' work--

20:44.477 --> 20:46.310
that's at least a dollar.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.581
Well, aren't you
a little capitalist.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.290
(antoon snoring)

21:01.628 --> 21:03.594
hey.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.663
What the hell
are you doing here?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.665
I got to tell you something.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.667
What?

21:12.672 --> 21:15.339
You're gonna hear talk,
about me,

21:15.375 --> 21:18.342
something I did
or maybe didn't do.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.644
Shining a bad light, I mean.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.646
Just be aware of whose lips
are doing the flapping.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.614
Are you being a fink? It sounds
like you're being a fink.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.551
-I botched a hit.
-You botched-- how's that?

21:27.587 --> 21:30.321
The cannon boy. Lemuel.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.490
Calamita said get in the car,
so I got in the car.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.392
We tailed the kid.
He said light him up.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.227
I'm sinking my teeth
into your jugular

21:36.262 --> 21:37.428
-if this story ends with...
-No, no, no. It don't.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.664
Like I said,
he told me to open up,

21:39.699 --> 21:41.632
but events didn't feel right.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.601
"on whose authority?" I ask him,

21:43.636 --> 21:46.337
but he don't say,
so I laid on the kibosh.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.339
But the kid saw my fangs,
no doubt.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.640
And look, look,
if you ordered it,

21:49.676 --> 21:51.509
I got no problem
accepting consequence.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.344
But I know you don't want
to start a war.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.246
I didn't order a goddamn hit!

21:57.283 --> 21:59.350
So you're saying what? Gaetano?

21:59.385 --> 22:02.219
You're telling me that porkpie,
ziti-eating greaser

22:02.255 --> 22:03.621
is giving my boys orders now?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.390
That sticky golem wop.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.525
(grunts)

22:07.560 --> 22:10.161
you gotta be kidding me!
(grunts)

22:11.597 --> 22:13.331
(shouts)

22:13.366 --> 22:15.266
(exhales)

22:19.505 --> 22:21.472
-(whistles)
-(grunts)

22:21.507 --> 22:23.474
-look. Here.
-(engine starts)

22:23.509 --> 22:26.210
you're a good boy. Reliable.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.411
-You're with me, right?
-Mm-hmm.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.647
All right.
You're gonna watch them.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.549
-Who?
-All of them.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.484
You're like a fucking bird
on a wire, got me?

22:33.519 --> 22:34.585
Eyes in the back of your head.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.687
What about calamita?

22:36.723 --> 22:40.224
Eh, don't worry, he'll get his.

22:40.259 --> 22:41.525
It's a new day. Got me?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.260
Spring fucking cleaning.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.596
You're either loyal,
or you're with him.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.400
Find that cop, odis.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.602
Tell him to come to the club,
rapid fire.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.414
(car door closes)

23:03.449 --> 23:04.548
(car departs)

23:09.272 --> 23:12.206
.
The pump and go out on route 16.

23:12.241 --> 23:14.275
I'm the nightman.

23:14.310 --> 23:18.312
You might tell the marshal
what you told me.

23:18.347 --> 23:20.314
About the lesbians?

23:20.349 --> 23:22.116
Well, there was two of them.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.052
Uh, a injun
and-and a colored woman.

23:26.122 --> 23:28.089
And they were conversing.

23:28.124 --> 23:30.057
Y-yes, sir, that's correct.

23:33.096 --> 23:34.228
About...?

23:39.168 --> 23:42.203
I'm asking, what was the nature
of the exchange?

23:42.238 --> 23:47.241
Oh. Uh, just, uh...
Normal chitchat.

23:48.311 --> 23:50.277
See, I th-thought you said

23:50.313 --> 23:52.146
they were talking about
skipping town?

23:55.284 --> 23:56.984
When you called me?

23:58.087 --> 24:00.287
Right. Yeah. Skipping town.

24:00.323 --> 24:01.989
That's affirmative.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.091
Uh, said they was headed
to chicago.

24:04.127 --> 24:05.392
Chicago?

24:05.428 --> 24:08.162
Yes, sir. Chicago.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.397
S-said they was on their way.

24:11.467 --> 24:13.267
There it is.

24:13.302 --> 24:15.402
Guess they flew the coop.
(chuckles)

24:20.042 --> 24:22.243
(sighs)

24:24.480 --> 24:28.249
I'll, uh, I'll walk you out.

24:31.154 --> 24:33.420
Thank you for coming in,
mr. Sinclair.

24:33.456 --> 24:37.191
-What's this?
-Don't be an idiot.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.160
(knocking and grunting
rhythmically)

24:42.465 --> 24:45.332
least I know how to open
a damn door.

24:48.471 --> 24:50.404
(door closes)

24:57.446 --> 24:59.413
guess you're off
to chicago, then, buddy.

24:59.448 --> 25:02.149
That's too bad. We were just
starting to hit it off.

25:02.185 --> 25:03.250
Funny story.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.086
What?

25:06.122 --> 25:08.088
We're a national agency,
turns out.

25:08.124 --> 25:09.423
The u.S. Marshal service.

25:09.458 --> 25:14.328
We got offices in chicago,
indianapolis, all over.

25:14.363 --> 25:16.997
-(exhales)
-so, I'll pass along
the tip, but...

25:17.033 --> 25:21.135
Kansas city was my mandate, and
kansas city is where I'll stay.

25:21.170 --> 25:24.138
You know,
in case they circle back.

25:24.173 --> 25:26.307
-(stammers)
-(footsteps approaching)

25:33.382 --> 25:35.282
(exhales)

25:35.318 --> 25:38.252
that's fine. I just thought--

25:38.287 --> 25:42.189
-I got to run an errand.
-An errand?

25:42.225 --> 25:44.258
(exhales)

25:44.293 --> 25:47.261
see a snitch, I'm saying.
An informant?

25:47.296 --> 25:49.363
You probably-- we got a code.

25:49.398 --> 25:51.298
Well, hell,
why didn't you say so?

25:51.334 --> 25:54.401
-I'll drive.
-That's-- d-don't...

25:54.437 --> 25:56.403
Don't, don't, don't,
don't trouble yourself.

25:56.439 --> 25:59.173
Amigo, please.
It's the least I can do.

26:15.091 --> 26:17.124
You giving orders now?

26:26.369 --> 26:29.203
Calm down.

26:29.238 --> 26:31.405
What?

26:31.440 --> 26:33.374
(chuckles)

26:36.312 --> 26:38.245
okay.

26:38.281 --> 26:39.947
It's a gun fight, asshole.

26:43.286 --> 26:47.054
What is this,
your little war council?

26:52.295 --> 26:54.228
Boss, I told them
to wait for you.

26:54.263 --> 26:55.929
Did you know?

26:58.267 --> 27:01.168
...Took a shot at loy's kid.
Did you know?

27:01.203 --> 27:03.304
Ebal:
I just found out
from the consigliere.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.976
And you,
you're lucky my man was there.

27:09.011 --> 27:10.077
Or I'd be cutting your throat

27:10.112 --> 27:12.246
with a can of cat food
right now.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.419
<i> Ayo.</i> They stole from us.

27:18.454 --> 27:21.388
This morning,
these<i> mulignani.</i> Yeah.

27:21.424 --> 27:23.223
300 guns.

27:27.396 --> 27:31.098
Because they think that...
We are weak.

27:33.169 --> 27:35.436
They're right. You're weak.

27:35.471 --> 27:37.338
You're weak.

27:37.373 --> 27:40.407
You took a shot, you missed.

27:40.443 --> 27:43.077
Now my enemy's got,

27:43.112 --> 27:46.013
what, 300 guns?

27:46.048 --> 27:48.082
Congratulations.

27:55.391 --> 27:58.025
Do it.

27:58.060 --> 28:00.027
Please. Do it.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.033
(quietly):
Do it.

28:22.351 --> 28:23.384
(sheathes knife)

28:25.454 --> 28:27.020
bang.

28:31.494 --> 28:33.093
Violante.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.094

28:38.067 --> 28:39.366
(door opens)

28:42.271 --> 28:44.004
(door closes)

28:58.254 --> 29:01.021
it's not his fault. Come on.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.165
(parking brake clicks)

29:33.105 --> 29:34.171
I'll be a minute.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.808
(grunting rhythmically)

29:37.843 --> 29:39.776
is this the minute?

29:42.915 --> 29:44.882
-I could come with.
-No.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.918
No, no. I-I got to--
don't want to spook him.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.058
(sniffles)

30:01.300 --> 30:03.233
(lighter flicking)

30:30.963 --> 30:32.229
son?

30:32.264 --> 30:35.199
Have you accepted
jesus christ into your heart?

30:35.234 --> 30:38.202
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What's the ordeal upstairs?

30:38.237 --> 30:40.003
Booze? Gambling?

30:40.039 --> 30:42.873
If a man's pud need a tug,

30:42.908 --> 30:45.842
would this be the place
for said tugging?

30:50.216 --> 30:52.249
What's that supposed to mean?

30:52.284 --> 30:54.151
You'll see.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.889
Morning.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.190
Ouch.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.795
What is that?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.897
An "o"?

31:06.932 --> 31:09.933
(chuckles)
listen...

31:09.969 --> 31:15.272
Get the fuck out of here
before I put an "o" in you.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.822
You ever been to salt lake?

31:31.857 --> 31:33.890
That's where I'm from.

31:35.961 --> 31:39.930
We had some italian gentlemen
move to town a few years back.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.032
Thought they could make
a few bucks

31:42.067 --> 31:46.770
turning our sons into junkies
and our daughters into whores.

31:46.805 --> 31:52.209
We dissuaded them of that notion
with a noose and some horses.

31:52.244 --> 31:55.245
Must have dragged them
six, seven miles

31:55.281 --> 31:58.749
before their heads...
Popped off.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.253
I'll be in the car,
waiting for my friend,

32:03.289 --> 32:05.789
if you need me.

32:05.824 --> 32:08.091
You fellas have a nice day.

32:21.273 --> 32:25.008
<i> Ebal:</i>
<i> Look, kid. We are trying</i>
<i> to avoid a war here.</i>

32:25.044 --> 32:27.210
So you're gonna remind
these<i> mulignani</i>

32:27.246 --> 32:29.112
that they ain't just
fighting us,

32:29.148 --> 32:30.247
they are fighting city hall.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.815
They are fighting the cops.

32:31.850 --> 32:34.918
Know your place. Tell them.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.854
Or else.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.128
talk back to me,

33:18.163 --> 33:21.898
You, put the muscle on cannon,
bust some heads,

33:21.934 --> 33:23.900
make some arrests.
