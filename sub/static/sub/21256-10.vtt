WEBVTT

00:01.593 --> 00:03.092
It's a new charter. Come with me.

00:03.094 --> 00:04.405
You're really gonna
bail on Anchor Beach?

00:04.429 --> 00:07.076
Honey, I might not have a
choice. And without Monte's vote,

00:07.077 --> 00:09.098
I don't know what chance we
have of saving this school.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.267
So I come in today and I find this.

00:11.269 --> 00:12.435
I didn't break the model.

00:12.437 --> 00:14.187
We had nothing to do with it.

00:16.107 --> 00:18.074
Logan's girlfriend thinks I'm after him,

00:18.109 --> 00:20.360
so I asked Wyatt to be
my pretend ex-boyfriend.

00:20.412 --> 00:21.760
Are you drunk?

00:21.761 --> 00:24.163
What if your ex-boyfriend
was really your ex-girlfriend?

00:24.199 --> 00:26.449
I love you. Please, just
give me another chance.

00:26.451 --> 00:29.252
Is that your girlfriend
kissing your brother?

00:29.287 --> 00:31.265
Why didn't you tell
me that AJ was at the protest?

00:31.289 --> 00:34.352
- You don't trust me?
- Well, it was pretty easy for me to steal you from him.

00:34.376 --> 00:36.175
Grace has leukemia.

00:36.211 --> 00:38.094
Please don't tell her I told you.

00:38.129 --> 00:40.296
I am an undocumented immigrant.

00:40.348 --> 00:42.098
Immigration's here for Ximena.

00:42.133 --> 00:43.466
Jude, I need you to call Noah's mom.

00:43.468 --> 00:46.352
Ask if her church will
give Ximena sanctuary, okay?

00:46.388 --> 00:48.104
Go, go, go!

00:49.307 --> 00:50.523
So what now?

00:52.477 --> 00:55.061
- Okay.
- Oh God, please.

00:55.113 --> 00:56.312
Okay.

00:57.482 --> 00:58.482
Yeah...

01:01.486 --> 01:05.321
- And?
- Oh, man, she is not happy with me.

01:05.322 --> 01:07.373
You did leave her at prom.

01:09.077 --> 01:11.160
It's the middle of
the night, where are you?

01:11.212 --> 01:13.246
- You wanna call Aaron?
- No.

01:13.298 --> 01:14.380
Not right now.

01:16.084 --> 01:18.001
Why isn't anyone answering me?

01:18.053 --> 01:21.087
Hey... it doesn't mean anything.

01:21.139 --> 01:23.172
There's a lot of reasons why
people don't answer their phones,

01:23.174 --> 01:25.308
like, Poppy's still at prom,

01:25.343 --> 01:28.011
she's probably just,
dancing or something.

01:28.063 --> 01:30.063
Hey, try not to worry about it.

01:30.098 --> 01:31.264
All right?

01:31.316 --> 01:33.099
My mom's on her way, so we're good.

01:33.151 --> 01:35.268
All right?

01:35.320 --> 01:37.437
Okay... so, what's next?

01:37.489 --> 01:39.355
You, uh, you have a plan?

01:39.407 --> 01:42.025
- Like, a family plan?
- Yeah, I'm supposed to call my lawyer.

01:42.077 --> 01:43.087
Okay, do you know the number?

01:43.111 --> 01:44.255
Yeah. They made me memorize it.

01:44.279 --> 01:45.361
Good.

01:47.248 --> 01:49.415
Hm, wait. Did their lights go off?

01:51.453 --> 01:53.119
Do you think they're leaving?

01:54.306 --> 01:56.890
I hope you're here to arrest
that girl for escaping custody.

01:58.276 --> 02:01.895
Oh, that's right. You can't go
in the church without a warrant.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.279
So you want me to go get her.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.982
Do your dirty work for you.

02:06.034 --> 02:09.953
So, what, this was the,
uh... the plan all along?

02:09.988 --> 02:11.955
You were in on it?

02:11.990 --> 02:13.184
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.992
Why are you doing this, anyway?

02:16.044 --> 02:18.211
Retaliation because she
spoke at the protest?

02:19.331 --> 02:21.164
It's a witch hunt, and you know it.

02:21.216 --> 02:22.882
She's got her DACA status.

02:22.918 --> 02:24.050
No, she doesn't.

02:25.086 --> 02:26.252
It's expired.

Oh, my God!

03:12.183 --> 03:14.300
Why are we dancing in
the parking lot? Come on!

03:14.302 --> 03:17.270
You are so pretty, you know that?

03:19.190 --> 03:20.251
What are you doing here?

03:20.275 --> 03:21.307
Mariana? Get Poppy.

03:21.359 --> 03:22.892
I need to talk to her, right now.

03:22.944 --> 03:24.227
Uh, yeah. Poppy, my mom's here,

03:24.279 --> 03:25.279
she wants to talk to you.

03:25.313 --> 03:27.146
Oh.

03:27.148 --> 03:28.148
What's wrong?

03:28.199 --> 03:30.984
So, Immigration came looking for Ximena.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.236
She's fine. She... she
made her way to a church

03:33.288 --> 03:34.320
and she's claiming sanctuary.

03:34.322 --> 03:35.872
Oh, my God.

03:35.907 --> 03:37.240
- Are you kidding?
- So messed up.

03:37.292 --> 03:40.293
- Oh, God, my phone's dead.
- Here, use mine.

03:41.913 --> 03:44.025
Ximena said she tried calling your
parents, but didn't get an answer.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.331
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

03:45.333 --> 03:47.194
No, they... they weren't
going out tonight or anything.

03:47.218 --> 03:49.230
Okay, um, can we take you
home? Should we take you home?

03:49.254 --> 03:51.087
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.974
It's okay. I'll go with her.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.154
You go on home. We'll meet you
there as soon as we can, okay?

03:57.178 --> 03:59.095
Okay. You guys in?

04:13.361 --> 04:14.944
Grace?

04:27.876 --> 04:29.876
Hey, Grace, you... you okay?

04:31.046 --> 04:32.295
- Hey, oh...
- Hi.

04:32.347 --> 04:35.014
- Do you feel all right?
- No, I feel like

04:35.050 --> 04:36.883
I have a cold or a flu or something.

04:38.937 --> 04:40.219
Come back to bed.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.226
So you don't have your DACA card?

04:47.278 --> 04:51.197
No. I mean I did, but it expired.

04:51.232 --> 04:53.199
Look, I let it lapse
'cause we had moved.

04:53.234 --> 04:56.069
And I was worried about giving
the government our new address.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.037
But I... I reapplied a while ago.

04:58.073 --> 04:59.872
And you haven't been approved yet?

04:59.908 --> 05:02.103
I don't know. I haven't received
anything in the mail yet.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.877
Look, my lawyer's on
his way. He'll know.

05:07.882 --> 05:09.048
Hello.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.084
Yep. It's Poppy.

05:11.086 --> 05:13.886
I had Lena go and pick her up.

05:13.922 --> 05:14.971
Hey.

05:15.006 --> 05:17.924
No, I'm okay. I promise.

05:19.060 --> 05:21.094
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

05:21.146 --> 05:23.124
I... heard that they were
gonna follow you to the station,

05:23.148 --> 05:24.981
and I just panicked.

05:25.016 --> 05:27.850
You should've trusted
me to handle it, Callie.

05:27.902 --> 05:29.268
Have you called Mike yet, AJ?

05:29.270 --> 05:32.105
Uh, no, I was actually just about to...

05:32.157 --> 05:35.074
And how... how did you
get involved in this?

05:35.110 --> 05:37.243
I... I was just outside, uh,

05:37.278 --> 05:38.995
when we saw you taking Ximena away.

05:39.030 --> 05:41.197
And what about Aaron? Was he there, too?

05:42.951 --> 05:44.117
He left, I think.

05:45.170 --> 05:49.005
- Are we in trouble?
- I don't know, AJ, I don't know.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.206
But until we find out,

05:50.258 --> 05:52.103
the two of you are not to
leave this church, either.

05:52.127 --> 05:53.292
You hear me?

05:55.130 --> 05:57.130
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.

05:57.132 --> 05:59.132
Oh, no.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.134
- Oh, my God...
- What?

06:01.186 --> 06:03.136
ICE is here, okay, I gotta go.

06:03.138 --> 06:06.856
Okay, don't panic. Hang up the
phone and record everything, okay?

06:06.891 --> 06:09.192
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

06:09.227 --> 06:11.144
- Record this.
- Wait, what?

06:11.146 --> 06:12.862
- Poppy...
- You have to record this!

06:12.897 --> 06:14.147
No, Poppy, hang on a second!

06:14.149 --> 06:16.949
Oh, my God... what's happening?

06:19.070 --> 06:21.154
Back up, please. Who's this?

06:21.156 --> 06:23.039
- We gotta stick to the plan.
- Who's this?

06:23.074 --> 06:24.218
She's our daughter. But she was born...

06:24.242 --> 06:26.292
I was born here. Look, here.

06:26.327 --> 06:28.161
Turn that off. You're not
allowed to record that.

06:28.163 --> 06:30.963
That is not true. Not true,
Mariana, keep recording.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.331
We know our rights. Keep recording.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.833
Are you 16?

06:33.885 --> 06:35.334
Yeah, but my sister, she's my guardian.

06:35.336 --> 06:37.303
Where is Ximena? Wasn't she with you?

06:38.973 --> 06:41.057
They... ICE... They were after her, too.

06:41.092 --> 06:43.059
- Oh, my God.
- Dios mio.

06:43.094 --> 06:45.011
No, but she's okay,
okay? She's at a church.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.312
She's okay.

06:46.347 --> 06:48.347
If she's not coming, we're gonna
have to take you in as well.

06:48.349 --> 06:49.982
What? No, I'm a citizen!

06:50.018 --> 06:51.295
- She's legal!
- She's documented!

06:51.319 --> 06:54.020
No, it's just to get you to
Child Protective Services, okay?

06:54.022 --> 06:56.939
- Mama...
- Listen, I'm a licensed foster care provider.

06:56.991 --> 06:58.302
I can take her home
with me, I can take her.

06:58.326 --> 06:59.992
I'm sorry, that's not how this works.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.911
- Come on,
- No, no, no!

07:01.946 --> 07:03.007
Wait, wait a second, wait a second.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.864
Can she go in and pack a bag?

07:04.866 --> 07:07.950
The girl is in a prom dress, let her
change her clothes for God's sake!

07:08.002 --> 07:09.952
- Please!
- Fine!

07:10.004 --> 07:11.287
You got two minutes.

07:11.339 --> 07:14.006
And she's goin' with you. Take her.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.042
Just go now!

07:16.094 --> 07:18.044
- Let's go.
- Take her quick and go.

07:18.096 --> 07:19.879
You two, against the fence.

07:19.931 --> 07:21.371
- Against the fence.
- Yes, sir, yes.

07:25.109 --> 07:26.225
- Yeah.
- Okay...

07:26.261 --> 07:27.894
What's going on?

07:29.113 --> 07:30.947
I was worried, Grace.

07:30.982 --> 07:32.982
Brandon, I'm fine. Honestly.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.283
Oh, my God, you're burning up.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.068
Honey, where is your thermometer?

07:36.070 --> 07:37.119
In the bathroom.

07:39.374 --> 07:41.157
Why did you call my mom?

07:44.913 --> 07:45.962
Yeah.

07:47.916 --> 07:49.081
Yeah, I will.

07:50.301 --> 07:51.968
All right, bye.

08:00.261 --> 08:02.061
So...

08:02.096 --> 08:04.096
they took your parents in.

08:04.098 --> 08:06.182
And Poppy is with CPS.

08:06.234 --> 08:08.267
I have to go... I have to go...

08:08.319 --> 08:10.820
Ximena! No! ICE is
still outside, you can't!

08:10.855 --> 08:12.822
- I can sneak out through the back...
- No, no...

08:12.857 --> 08:14.991
Listen, I'm supposed to take Poppy!

08:15.026 --> 08:16.887
- I know...
- I'm supposed to be her guardian, okay?

08:16.911 --> 08:18.305
- That's the plan!
- I know it is, Ximena,

08:18.329 --> 08:20.279
but you are no good to anybody

08:20.281 --> 08:22.281
if you get detained too, okay?

08:25.086 --> 08:26.953
I know, come here, I know.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.839
Thank you for doing this.

08:29.874 --> 08:31.924
Of course.
We're happy to help.

08:33.094 --> 08:35.962
It's so inhumane what
they're doing to people.

08:37.097 --> 08:38.297
Ripping families apart.

08:45.223 --> 08:47.974
A hundred and two. We gotta
get you to the hospital.

08:48.026 --> 08:49.308
- No, Mom, you're overreacting.
- Grace...

08:49.310 --> 08:51.944
- It's just a cold.
- I'm not doing this with you.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.980
Mom, I'm not a child, I'm an adult.

08:54.032 --> 08:56.176
- Then stop talk acting like...
- Please don't fight in front of Brandon.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.317
Grace, I... I think you
should listen to your mom.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.154
What?

09:02.156 --> 09:04.824
Why are you on her side?
Why are you saying that?

09:07.211 --> 09:09.078
Did you tell him?

09:12.300 --> 09:14.300
Do you know?

09:19.140 --> 09:21.007
So that's what last night was all about.

09:24.012 --> 09:26.262
The limo? The tiara?

09:26.314 --> 09:29.849
Some pity prom for the
poor, sick girl, huh?

09:29.901 --> 09:31.183
That wasn't it at all, Grace.

09:31.235 --> 09:32.318
Get out.

09:32.353 --> 09:35.237
- Grace, don't...
- I wasn't trying to...

09:35.273 --> 09:37.323
Get... out.

09:37.358 --> 09:39.158
Please?

09:43.197 --> 09:46.198
My mom said Immigration is still there.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.284
They're stuck in the church for now.

09:48.336 --> 09:51.253
I don't understand... why
can't Callie and AJ leave?

09:51.289 --> 09:53.089
What was AJ even doing there?

09:53.124 --> 09:54.874
Who's AJ?

09:54.926 --> 09:57.043
He's Callie's ex.

09:57.045 --> 09:58.294
Yo, can you pass the O's?

09:58.346 --> 10:02.214
So, what happened to her
boyfriend? Adam... or Aaron?

10:02.216 --> 10:04.050
I don't know, maybe they broke up.

10:04.052 --> 10:06.102
People breakin' up at prom all the time.

10:06.137 --> 10:08.354
- And gettin' back together.
- Mmm.

10:08.389 --> 10:10.973
So, why were you all up on Mariana?

10:11.025 --> 10:13.059
That was just an act, right?

10:13.061 --> 10:16.228
There was never any ex-boyfriend
or girlfriend, was there?

10:16.230 --> 10:19.065
Yeah...

10:19.067 --> 10:21.317
no, there was never an ex-anything.

10:23.121 --> 10:24.203
Told you.

10:24.238 --> 10:26.155
Yeah, but, why would she do that?

10:26.207 --> 10:27.323
Well, she was freaked out

10:27.375 --> 10:30.159
by that nasty DM Olivia sent her.

10:30.211 --> 10:31.243
So she made it up.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.214
What DM?

10:35.249 --> 10:37.133
There's no rollover with DACA.

10:37.168 --> 10:40.252
Once it expired, so did
her low-priority status.

10:40.254 --> 10:43.389
- But she reapplied.
- Is there any way to find out if it's been approved yet?

10:43.424 --> 10:45.307
Not in the middle of the night.

10:45.343 --> 10:47.204
And it could be a while
before we hear anything...

10:47.228 --> 10:49.979
Which means I'm not getting
out of here anytime soon, am I?

10:50.014 --> 10:51.263
Mm-mm.

10:51.265 --> 10:53.015
So do you know where my parents are?

10:53.067 --> 10:56.268
No. There are several detention
centers in the area, but...

10:56.320 --> 10:58.070
So what about Poppy?

10:58.106 --> 11:01.157
Well, there's no way CPS is
gonna allow you to be her guardian

11:01.192 --> 11:03.075
without your DACA status approved.

11:03.111 --> 11:04.567
I never should've reapplied.

11:04.568 --> 11:06.112
Like, I never should've
trusted the government.

11:06.164 --> 11:08.225
At least ICE wouldn't have
known where to find my family.

11:08.249 --> 11:12.084
No, if they wanted to find your
family, they would. It's not hard.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.202
Second of all...

11:13.254 --> 11:16.122
DACA is your best chance
at not being deported.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.124
So what else can we do?

11:18.176 --> 11:21.927
Well... the most
important thing right now

11:21.963 --> 11:24.046
is to make Ximena as
visible as possible.

11:24.098 --> 11:27.266
Public outcry is one of the
few things ICE is afraid of.

11:27.301 --> 11:30.136
So we need to figure out
how to spread the word?

11:30.138 --> 11:33.939
- Mm-hm.
- Hey! So, uh, we got a problem.

11:35.977 --> 11:38.227
I'm the pastor here, this is my church.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.062
You'll need a warrant to come inside.

11:40.114 --> 11:41.258
They've got a fugitive in there.

11:41.282 --> 11:43.149
Ximena Sinfuego is claiming sanctuary.

11:43.151 --> 11:45.234
I don't care. And she
can't claim sanctuary

11:45.286 --> 11:47.153
for escaping police custody.

11:47.155 --> 11:49.989
Look, if you won't do your job
and bring her out, they will.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.323
We gotta get Ximena outta here.

11:57.165 --> 12:00.060
Ximena Sinfuego did not escape custody.

12:00.062 --> 12:03.947
I was, uh, I was made to believe
that she had been drinking.

12:03.982 --> 12:05.099
She's underage.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.651
But I issued a breathalyzer
and it came back clear,

12:07.686 --> 12:09.269
so I released her.

12:09.321 --> 12:10.521
That's a load of crap.

12:10.573 --> 12:12.523
Can I please talk with
you guys for a second?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.360
No! AJ, no...

12:16.362 --> 12:19.246
We have to trust my mom, okay?

12:19.281 --> 12:20.559
We can't take a chance like that.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.367
At least in here, Ximena has some hope.

12:23.419 --> 12:25.369
Let's just try to do something useful.

12:27.423 --> 12:30.591
Listen, you're punishing this girl
because she spoke out at a rally.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.955
You know, free speech

12:31.956 --> 12:34.711
is kind of a fundamental
American value, don't you think?

12:34.713 --> 12:37.631
- Well...
- Hey, listen, she's a good kid.

12:37.683 --> 12:41.218
You know? She's not a
criminal, she's... she's...

12:41.270 --> 12:43.281
I know her. She's one of my
daughter's closest friends.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.222
She's in there with her right now, okay?

12:45.274 --> 12:46.723
- Your kid's in there?
- Yeah.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.309
Yeah, both our kids are in there.

12:49.361 --> 12:53.230
You guys know we don't
have to comply with ICE.

12:53.282 --> 12:55.315
Please let this go, all right?

13:02.241 --> 13:03.407
All right. You got it.

13:03.459 --> 13:05.325
All right, thank you. Be safe.

13:05.377 --> 13:06.410
You guys have a good one.

13:09.582 --> 13:14.418
Yes. Hi, uh, I'm trying to
find out where a girl was, um...

13:14.420 --> 13:16.253
A girl was brought in to CPS tonight,

13:16.255 --> 13:18.305
we're trying to find
out where she was taken?

13:18.340 --> 13:19.673
Poppy Sinfuego.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.593
Monte came over tonight.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.344
What? Why?

13:24.396 --> 13:26.263
'Cause she got another job.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.397
She's leaving Anchor Beach.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.349
- Are you serious?
- No way.

13:29.401 --> 13:32.436
Oh, my God. If she leaves,
does that mean we lose her vote?

13:32.438 --> 13:34.271
And that's not even the worst part.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.656
Yeah, I can... I can wait.

13:37.576 --> 13:39.610
Mama might be going with her.

13:40.746 --> 13:42.362
Yeah.

13:43.449 --> 13:45.282
Um, did you find her?

13:45.334 --> 13:46.500
Nobody knows anything.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.346
I doubt we're gonna get
any answers until tomorrow.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.514
But I'm... I'm gonna keep trying.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.372
Okay. I'll text Callie
and let Ximena know.

13:52.424 --> 13:53.424
Thank you, honey.

13:58.825 --> 14:00.000
_

14:00.466 --> 14:01.466
What?

14:02.468 --> 14:05.218
Oh, uh... nothing.

14:07.439 --> 14:09.556
Hey, what's... what's goin' on?

14:09.608 --> 14:11.475
- We got no idea.
- Not a lot.

14:11.477 --> 14:13.644
Oh, uh...

14:13.646 --> 14:15.612
What?

14:15.648 --> 14:17.648
Callie's live on Facebook.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.316
- Hm?
- Yeah.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.617
What? Can you hand me my phone?

14:20.653 --> 14:22.619
They chased us like we were criminals.

14:22.655 --> 14:25.656
Like if we robbed a bank, or
killed someone or something.

14:25.708 --> 14:29.409
- They took my family away...
- Oh, my God.

14:29.461 --> 14:31.662
For no reason.

14:31.714 --> 14:34.214
You know, we're... we're good people.

14:37.503 --> 14:40.337
We haven't... we haven't
done anything wrong.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.258
All because...

14:45.311 --> 14:48.345
she dared to speak up against
U.S. immigration policy,

14:48.397 --> 14:50.347
which is really messed up.

14:51.650 --> 14:57.437
So Ximena is claiming
sanctuary in this church,

14:57.489 --> 15:00.657
and we're not leaving here
until she can come, too,

15:00.693 --> 15:04.528
so, we should sign off now,
but please send this video

15:04.580 --> 15:06.530
to everyone you know.

15:06.582 --> 15:09.199
We need to get Ximena's story out there.

15:10.419 --> 15:11.419
Thanks.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.347
Hey, bud... I'm kinda
surprised you're home.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.599
You okay? How was... How was prom?

15:25.634 --> 15:29.469
Um... it was great until it wasn't.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.389
What happened?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.693
Grace has leukemia.

15:36.729 --> 15:39.363
Oh, my God.

15:39.398 --> 15:43.400
Yeah. Apparently, she's...
having some sort of relapse

15:43.402 --> 15:47.287
- or whatever they call it.
- Oh, no...

15:47.322 --> 15:49.373
And she didn't want me to know,

15:49.408 --> 15:51.708
but her mom told me.

15:51.744 --> 15:55.579
And um... tonight she got, a... a fever,

15:55.581 --> 15:58.415
and I didn't know what to
do, so I called her mom,

15:58.467 --> 15:59.633
and made her come over.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.419
Honey, you did the right
thing, you know that, right?

16:03.672 --> 16:05.589
Why didn't she want me to know?

16:07.309 --> 16:10.594
I don' t know. She's
probably... a little embarrassed,

16:10.596 --> 16:14.598
and scared, and... doesn't want
you to see her so vulnerable, maybe?

16:14.650 --> 16:16.516
But that doesn't change
how I feel about her,

16:16.568 --> 16:18.402
I mean, I... I still love her.

16:24.326 --> 16:26.359
Well, she might not trust that.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.330
Maybe you need to show her.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.293
Okay, Pastor Nicole is gonna be

16:43.345 --> 16:45.262
bringing some bedding in for you guys.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.348
Try and get some sleep,
as much as you can.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.467
Um, Mike and I will be out in my car,

16:50.519 --> 16:52.219
keepin' an eye on ICE.

16:52.271 --> 16:55.388
- Why aren't they leaving?
- I don't know, love, I don't know.

16:57.476 --> 17:00.227
It's gonna be okay. Trust us.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.364
Call us if you need anything, okay?

17:04.398 --> 17:05.531
Yeah.

17:09.238 --> 17:12.289
I hate to even say this, but one
reason they might be hanging around

17:12.324 --> 17:14.290
is if they're tryin' to get a warrant.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.242
I thought they wouldn't
come into a church.

17:16.295 --> 17:17.661
They won't come in for Ximena,

17:17.663 --> 17:21.298
but they could get the FBI
to come in for your kids.

17:30.225 --> 17:32.476
Are you trying to get a
warrant to arrest our kids?

17:32.511 --> 17:34.344
They're transporting an
undocumented immigrant

17:34.346 --> 17:35.657
and interfered with a
federal investigation.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.682
Come on... as far as I know,
no citizen of the United States

17:38.684 --> 17:42.352
has ever been arrested for helping
an immigrant find sanctuary.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.715
Look, you wanna take your kids home?

17:43.739 --> 17:45.689
All you gotta do is go in there
and bring out Ximena Sinfuego,

17:45.691 --> 17:47.407
and this all goes away.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.525
Wow.

17:52.826 --> 17:54.006
They're just bluffing.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.175
They're not gonna arrest Callie and AJ,

17:56.212 --> 17:58.462
but we're not leaving
here until ICE does.

17:58.514 --> 17:59.680
That's smart.

17:59.715 --> 18:02.182
What'd you say to Callie about
getting involved in all this?

18:02.217 --> 18:04.301
I don't know exactly what to say to her.

18:04.353 --> 18:07.387
Well, I mean, at least she
didn't put her life in jeopardy.

18:09.308 --> 18:12.275
Yeah, well, I guess
that's something, huh.

18:12.311 --> 18:16.146
- It was for a really good reason.
- It always is, isn't it?

18:16.198 --> 18:18.198
Listen, we're gonna stay here tonight,

18:18.233 --> 18:20.462
and keep an eye on things. You
guys need to get some sleep.

18:20.486 --> 18:22.069
I love you.

18:22.071 --> 18:23.236
I love you, too.

18:23.288 --> 18:25.205
Call me if anything changes.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.074
Of course I will.

18:32.331 --> 18:34.214
I just talked to my guy at the Bureau.

18:34.249 --> 18:36.083
He says if this was a year ago,

18:36.085 --> 18:37.417
no way the FBI would touch this,

18:37.469 --> 18:41.088
but today, if ICE is putting a
lot of pressure on them, who knows?

18:42.091 --> 18:44.141
So, there you go.

18:46.178 --> 18:47.427
Wow...

18:47.429 --> 18:49.429
it's been a long time since
I've heard you do that.

18:49.481 --> 18:51.064
Do what?

18:52.151 --> 18:53.483
Forget to breathe.

18:53.519 --> 18:56.269
- What?
- You used to do that all the time

18:56.271 --> 18:58.105
when we were married.
You'd forget to breathe.

18:58.107 --> 18:59.501
Used to scare the bejesus outta me.

18:59.525 --> 19:01.108
Really?

19:03.112 --> 19:04.277
I had no idea.

19:06.248 --> 19:08.281
Here's some more blankets and pillows.

19:08.333 --> 19:12.119
And, uh, there's some stuff, some...

19:12.171 --> 19:15.288
sweatpants and stuff
from our clothing drive.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.457
It's all clean, I promise.

19:17.459 --> 19:19.259
Thank you.

19:20.662 --> 19:24.614
I don't mean to overstep,
but if anyone wants to talk

19:24.666 --> 19:27.584
or pray, I'm here.

19:27.619 --> 19:31.171
Thank you so much for everything
that you're doing for me.

19:32.257 --> 19:34.174
But...

19:34.209 --> 19:37.344
I don't know how to pray to
a god that allows my family

19:37.379 --> 19:39.462
to get torn apart.

19:39.464 --> 19:42.182
Oh, I...

19:42.217 --> 19:43.600
I don't pray to that God, either.

19:44.636 --> 19:47.470
I don't believe in a God that...

19:47.472 --> 19:49.472
controls every little
thing that happens on Earth.

19:49.474 --> 19:53.526
I don't think that God decides who
wins a football game or the Grammys.

19:53.562 --> 19:56.313
I believe in Emmanuel.

19:57.399 --> 19:59.316
The name we give Jesus at Christmas.

20:00.452 --> 20:02.652
It literally means "God with us."

20:05.324 --> 20:09.326
And God is with you... always.

20:09.378 --> 20:11.328
In things big and small.

20:12.664 --> 20:16.216
In the strength you
have to keep going...

20:16.251 --> 20:18.418
in your hope...

20:18.470 --> 20:19.636
in other people.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.557
You should get some rest.

20:24.593 --> 20:26.593
- I'll be in my office.
- Okay.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.678
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Beth.

20:30.599 --> 20:32.232
I should get changed.

20:37.439 --> 20:39.272
This seems appropriate.

20:42.361 --> 20:44.361
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:49.334 --> 20:53.536
I'm really sorry I got
you mixed up in all this.

20:55.707 --> 20:59.259
I knew what I was gettin'
myself into, Callie.

21:00.545 --> 21:02.345
I didn't.

21:02.381 --> 21:04.631
What did you expect,
runnin' away from ICE?

21:04.683 --> 21:07.384
Well, I didn't think
they were gonna chase us.

21:09.388 --> 21:13.356
I knew my mom would not
be happy about it, but...

21:16.478 --> 21:19.279
I don't know, I... I can't, like,

21:19.314 --> 21:23.233
just stand by and watch
bad things happen to people.

21:23.285 --> 21:24.401
No kidding.

21:36.581 --> 21:39.716
I just hope my family
isn't disappointed in me.

21:39.751 --> 21:41.418
Again.

21:44.589 --> 21:45.638
Ugh... okay, enough!

21:45.674 --> 21:47.257
I'm not trying to see that.

21:47.259 --> 21:49.259
Mm. You're rude.

21:49.311 --> 21:50.593
All right, okay, all right.

21:50.595 --> 21:52.312
Sorry!

21:52.347 --> 21:54.397
Get moving.

21:54.433 --> 21:56.266
So Emma, you got everything you need?

21:56.318 --> 21:57.600
Mm-hm. Thank you.

21:58.737 --> 22:01.237
So are you really leaving ABCC?

22:02.491 --> 22:03.606
Jude told me.

22:03.658 --> 22:07.277
I don't know. I might not have a choice.

22:07.329 --> 22:10.246
I mean, there might not even be
an Anchor Beach to come back to.

22:10.282 --> 22:11.614
Or they might fire me.

22:11.666 --> 22:13.616
I mean, I have to keep my options open.

22:13.668 --> 22:15.535
What, so you're just gonna abandon us?

22:15.587 --> 22:17.530
No, Mariana, I'm going to make sure

22:17.531 --> 22:19.456
that I can still
provide for this family.

22:19.458 --> 22:21.257
I hardly think that's abandoning anyone.

22:21.293 --> 22:22.625
Can we talk about this later?

22:29.384 --> 22:31.384
What did you see on your phone earlier?

22:31.436 --> 22:34.521
Uh, you mean, like,
Callie's live-stream?

22:34.556 --> 22:36.473
No. In the kitchen, earlier,

22:36.475 --> 22:38.558
you looked at your phone and...

22:38.610 --> 22:40.560
you got a weird look on your face.

22:44.566 --> 22:46.399
I got a text from Nick.

22:46.451 --> 22:49.619
- Mariana...
- He told me that he knows who destroyed the model,

22:49.654 --> 22:51.571
and that he can help
us save Anchor Beach.

22:51.623 --> 22:53.373
Wait, you don't believe him, do you?

22:54.659 --> 22:57.460
Maybe he just wants an excuse
to get back in touch with you.

22:57.496 --> 22:59.496
Come on, he is so manipulative.

22:59.548 --> 23:01.498
I know. It's just...

23:01.500 --> 23:04.250
Look, you heard my mom.

23:04.302 --> 23:05.502
What if we can't save the school?

23:05.504 --> 23:08.338
Okay, we don't know what's gonna happen.

23:08.340 --> 23:12.175
Not yet, anyway, so... don't
go doing anything stupid.

23:12.227 --> 23:13.393
I won't.

23:14.513 --> 23:16.596
Don't worry, I know who Nick is.

23:21.353 --> 23:22.485
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:23.605 --> 23:26.523
Grace... Grace.

23:26.575 --> 23:29.359
I'm gonna grab a coffee
and let you guys talk.

23:29.411 --> 23:30.610
Okay?

23:39.337 --> 23:42.338
My mom told me that she made you promise

23:42.374 --> 23:43.506
not to tell me you knew.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.625
Still, I'm sorry.

23:47.596 --> 23:49.462
It's okay, I would've
done the same thing.

23:56.605 --> 23:58.471
Just so you know...

23:59.808 --> 24:03.309
it's not the reason why I wanted
you to have an awesome prom.

24:03.361 --> 24:07.363
I mean, I... I was planning
all of that way before...

24:07.399 --> 24:10.366
ever s... since you told me
you never got to go to one.

24:11.453 --> 24:14.237
Why didn't you tell me, though?

24:16.291 --> 24:18.291
Uh, um...

24:20.295 --> 24:24.214
I was diagnosed with
leukemia when I was nine.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.550
And I barely remember a time

24:27.586 --> 24:30.253
when I wasn't the "sick girl."

24:30.255 --> 24:32.589
The one with cancer, the one...

24:34.342 --> 24:37.594
that everyone looked at with
a pitiful shake of the head.

24:37.646 --> 24:39.596
And you never looked at me like that.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.516
Which was one of my
favorite things about us.

24:44.686 --> 24:46.603
I didn't wanna change what we had.

24:46.655 --> 24:49.656
But it doesn't. Nothing can.

24:51.359 --> 24:52.442
Thank you.

24:53.695 --> 24:56.446
But I mean, we both
know I need to go home.

24:56.448 --> 24:59.332
And you have your whole life here.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.451
Yeah, we can figure
it out, though, we...

25:01.503 --> 25:02.619
Come on.

25:04.289 --> 25:06.372
At least have enough respect for me

25:06.424 --> 25:08.458
to admit the truth.

25:09.678 --> 25:11.628
That we need to say goodbye.

25:50.669 --> 25:54.470
Why were you outside with me...

25:54.506 --> 25:56.639
when Immigration came for Ximena?

25:58.560 --> 26:00.343
I'm grateful that you were.

26:01.563 --> 26:04.180
Um...

26:04.232 --> 26:06.399
it looked like you and
Aaron got into a fight,

26:06.434 --> 26:09.435
and I, uh, I just wanted to
make sure you were all right.

26:09.487 --> 26:11.604
So you left Dawn to come check on me?

26:15.577 --> 26:17.410
So what were you guys fighting' about?

26:17.445 --> 26:20.196
You, mostly.

26:21.499 --> 26:23.199
It's always you.

26:29.441 --> 26:32.825
So, you haven't called him
'cause you guys were fighting?

26:32.864 --> 26:35.448
He... He kinda gave me an out.

26:36.951 --> 26:41.454
He said that, um, if I wanted to talk,

26:41.456 --> 26:43.706
that he would be waiting in the car.

26:43.758 --> 26:47.760
And I was gonna go, but
that's when I saw Immigration,

26:47.796 --> 26:50.546
so I just never showed up.

26:50.598 --> 26:52.882
I don't know, maybe it's better.

26:54.636 --> 26:56.686
Yeah, maybe I should just...

26:58.556 --> 26:59.856
like, let it go.

27:03.695 --> 27:05.728
He said some really shitty things.

27:06.815 --> 27:08.564
Do you want out?

27:10.652 --> 27:11.868
I don't know.

27:15.573 --> 27:18.791
I gotta admit, I, uh...

27:18.827 --> 27:20.743
I thought being with someone else

27:20.795 --> 27:23.579
was gonna make getting over
you a lot easier, but...

27:26.468 --> 27:28.501
Maybe it takes time.

27:29.754 --> 27:32.588
Or maybe, I don't really wanna do it.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.424
Get over you, I mean.

27:41.649 --> 27:43.733
We should really get some sleep.

27:46.905 --> 27:49.572
You go on.

27:50.825 --> 27:52.658
I'll be down in a few minutes.

27:52.694 --> 27:53.694
Okay.

28:10.628 --> 28:11.761
So...

28:13.548 --> 28:16.382
you and AJ have history, or what?

28:16.434 --> 28:18.551
Yeah. I never told you that?

28:18.603 --> 28:19.719
Mm-mm.

28:19.721 --> 28:21.554
I mean, he's hot.

28:21.556 --> 28:22.722
Yeah.

28:22.774 --> 28:24.524
Are you interested?

28:24.559 --> 28:25.641
No...

28:25.693 --> 28:27.643
I don't date boys.

28:27.695 --> 28:30.563
I'm gay. I never told you that?

28:30.615 --> 28:32.448
Um, no...

28:32.483 --> 28:34.617
I mean, it doesn't matter or anything.

28:34.652 --> 28:35.785
Good.

28:37.539 --> 28:39.655
I can't believe I just
came out to you in a church.

28:39.707 --> 28:41.824
Hope I don't get struck by lightning.

28:41.876 --> 28:43.743
Yeah...

28:43.745 --> 28:46.579
No, just because I don't
wanna get hit by lightning.

28:46.581 --> 28:49.715
Not because... you're... you know...

28:53.721 --> 28:55.805
Oh...

28:55.840 --> 28:57.640
And just so you know...

28:58.676 --> 29:01.844
this is my worst nightmare.

29:01.896 --> 29:04.647
And I thank God...

29:04.682 --> 29:06.849
that I'm not going through it alone.

29:18.046 --> 29:20.280
I hate not knowing if Callie's okay.

29:27.705 --> 29:29.789
Both our moms are there.

29:31.459 --> 29:33.459
Everything's gonna be fine.

29:35.930 --> 29:37.463
You don't know that.

29:38.850 --> 29:40.800
You don't know Callie.

29:43.471 --> 29:46.639
Well, whatever happens...

29:48.476 --> 29:50.443
I'm here.

29:52.814 --> 29:54.480
Always.

29:58.820 --> 30:01.537
I love you.

30:02.657 --> 30:04.457
I love you, too.

30:19.307 --> 30:20.473
Good morning.

30:20.525 --> 30:21.724
I'm Dr. Choi.

30:21.976 --> 30:23.843
Hi, I'm Susan. I'm Grace's mom.

30:23.895 --> 30:25.511
Well, it's nice to meet you both.

30:25.563 --> 30:26.679
Grace, how are you feeling?

30:26.731 --> 30:28.731
Pretty good, I guess.

30:28.766 --> 30:30.733
Well, it's good you came in...

30:30.768 --> 30:33.903
We'll get you stronger, and hopefully
you can go home in a few days.

30:33.938 --> 30:36.906
But there's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

30:36.941 --> 30:39.742
I just had a nice long talk
with your oncologist in Marin.

30:39.777 --> 30:42.745
We both agree, there is a
new treatment we offer here

30:42.780 --> 30:44.664
for recurrent adolescent leukemia,

30:44.699 --> 30:48.534
just approved by the FDA, that
you are a perfect candidate for.

30:48.586 --> 30:49.952
Really, what is it?

30:50.004 --> 30:53.673
- Gene therapy.
- Gene therapy? What... What is that?

30:53.708 --> 30:55.624
Well, we alter some of your cells,

30:55.677 --> 30:57.855
then re-insert them into your
body to attack the cancer.

30:57.879 --> 31:00.463
Basically, it super-charges
your immune system

31:00.515 --> 31:03.516
to fight the disease, and we've
been seeing incredible results.

31:03.551 --> 31:05.518
More than 80 percent of
people go into remission.

31:05.553 --> 31:07.720
Wow, that sounds amazing.

31:07.722 --> 31:11.440
It is. Of course, there can
be potential side effects,

31:11.476 --> 31:13.776
uh, fever, blood pressure problems,

31:13.811 --> 31:14.894
lung congestion,

31:14.946 --> 31:18.647
some of which can be
life-threatening themselves, so...

31:20.651 --> 31:22.785
Well, even so, what do you think?

31:22.820 --> 31:25.488
Brandon... this doesn't concern you.

31:25.540 --> 31:28.541
Mom... I wanna do it.

31:28.576 --> 31:30.910
Grace, you heard what she said.

31:30.962 --> 31:33.546
The side effects alone
could be life-threatening.

31:33.581 --> 31:36.916
Yes, and this disease
is also life-threatening.

31:36.918 --> 31:38.751
And a jillion rounds
of chemo haven't worked.

31:38.753 --> 31:40.886
- Grace, we need to talk about this...
- No, we don't.

31:40.922 --> 31:44.890
With all due respect, I mean,
if it... it's what she wants,

31:44.926 --> 31:46.592
isn't it up to her?

31:46.644 --> 31:47.893
Yeah.

31:47.929 --> 31:49.895
Mom, I'm doing this
whether you like it or not,

31:49.931 --> 31:52.598
and if you don't approve,
you can just home without me.

32:05.727 --> 32:07.393
Mike, get off...

32:09.564 --> 32:12.231
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

32:12.283 --> 32:13.449
- Hmm.
- Look.

32:18.656 --> 32:20.323
Hello?

32:20.375 --> 32:21.407
Look outside.

32:21.409 --> 32:22.542
What?

32:22.577 --> 32:24.627
Look outside.

32:24.662 --> 32:26.662
Guys. Guys? Get up.

32:26.714 --> 32:28.497
Get up. Get up.

32:28.550 --> 32:30.299
- Hmm?
- I don't know.

32:30.335 --> 32:31.667
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.

32:42.730 --> 32:46.432
Oh, my God! They're all here for you!

32:59.364 --> 33:01.247
We, uh, we brought some
clothes and some food.

33:01.282 --> 33:03.310
We couldn't just sit at home
and do nothing, but I guess...

33:03.334 --> 33:04.428
everyone else had the same idea.

33:04.452 --> 33:05.452
Yeah. No kidding.

33:07.422 --> 33:09.338
They don't look very disappointed to me.

33:21.302 --> 33:23.269
What is the FBI doing here?

33:27.308 --> 33:28.691
What's going on?

33:28.726 --> 33:30.476
I think they're here for our kids.

33:37.513 --> 33:40.381
I know that she doesn't want you
to leave, okay? She needs you.

33:40.416 --> 33:41.632
I'm not leaving. It's just...

33:41.634 --> 33:44.268
Scary as hell.

33:44.304 --> 33:45.636
Yeah.

33:45.638 --> 33:47.438
You know, we've been
through this before.

33:47.473 --> 33:51.525
I mean, it's just... so
hard, you have no idea.

33:51.561 --> 33:54.562
Her father's completely unreliable.

33:54.614 --> 33:56.397
He's got a new family of his own,

33:56.449 --> 33:58.616
and... we have no help here.

33:58.651 --> 34:01.452
There's no support system.

34:01.487 --> 34:02.570
Yes, you do.

34:02.622 --> 34:03.622
Me.

34:33.652 --> 34:35.353
Wrap it up! We're outta here!

34:39.659 --> 34:42.693
Oh, my God! ICE is leaving!

34:44.447 --> 34:48.416
Thank you! Thank you!

34:48.451 --> 34:50.501
I'm so glad you guys aren't in trouble.

34:54.674 --> 34:56.340
- Hey!
- Hey!

34:56.376 --> 34:58.292
Pretty big, huh?

34:58.344 --> 35:00.511
Hey, girl.

35:00.546 --> 35:02.430
Here's a couple things
for you, all right?

35:02.465 --> 35:04.298
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

35:04.350 --> 35:05.633
You did a good thing here.

35:08.388 --> 35:10.388
But I'm... I'm not done.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.189
Honey, it's time to come home.

35:12.225 --> 35:15.226
No! Ximena can't leave
until her DACA's sorted out.

35:15.278 --> 35:17.561
And they could come and
get her at any point,

35:17.613 --> 35:20.564
and I... I... I promised her that
I wouldn't leave until she's...

35:20.616 --> 35:24.568
We know. We really
admire your loyalty, Cal,

35:24.620 --> 35:26.620
but you also promised us

35:26.656 --> 35:29.490
that you would take care of
yourself, not blow things up.

35:29.542 --> 35:32.493
- But this isn't...
- You still have a lot of things to do right now,

35:32.545 --> 35:34.495
you have to complete
your college applications,

35:34.547 --> 35:36.547
finish school, graduate...

35:36.582 --> 35:37.582
It's not a debate, honey.

35:37.633 --> 35:39.250
It's not a debate.

35:46.642 --> 35:48.426
Here.

35:48.428 --> 35:50.678
- Just give me a minute.
- Yes.

35:57.687 --> 36:01.188
You didn't think I was gonna let
you stay in here with me, did you?

36:02.492 --> 36:04.608
You can do me a lot more good out there.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.610
No offense, but, uh...

36:06.612 --> 36:08.529
you snore like my Uncle Jorge.

36:10.249 --> 36:13.250
No, seriously. We call
him Uncle Snore-hey.

36:15.671 --> 36:18.539
I, uh... I can never thank you enough.

36:18.591 --> 36:22.460
I've never met anyone who cares
about other people more than you.

36:27.517 --> 36:29.633
- Call me anytime, okay?
- Yeah.

36:29.685 --> 36:31.385
I'm gonna come back.

36:31.437 --> 36:33.304
Thank you.

36:33.306 --> 36:34.472
Yeah.

36:34.474 --> 36:35.474
Okay.

36:40.646 --> 36:43.531
She's right, you know?

36:43.566 --> 36:45.366
That's one of the best things about you.

36:51.657 --> 36:53.657
All right, let's do this.

36:59.665 --> 37:01.248
There she is!

37:04.220 --> 37:06.504
- You went viral.
- Oh, my God...

37:06.556 --> 37:08.589
- Thank you, guys.
- I'm happy you're safe.

37:18.518 --> 37:20.401
Okay, I'm gonna take Mama to the car,

37:20.436 --> 37:22.353
you guys catch up, yes?

37:28.578 --> 37:29.578
Hey.

37:31.330 --> 37:32.663
I saw your Facebook Live.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.449
I'm glad you're okay.

37:35.501 --> 37:37.334
Thanks.

37:37.370 --> 37:39.286
Are we okay?

37:41.374 --> 37:43.424
Yeah, I can come by and
see the school next week.

37:43.459 --> 37:44.675
When?

37:48.297 --> 37:50.548
Okay, uh, anytime after 2:00 is fine.

37:54.270 --> 37:55.670
Yeah, I know where that is...

37:55.671 --> 37:57.371
_

37:57.473 --> 38:00.558
Okay, well, we can just
say 3:30 then, that's fine.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.359
Okay, great. Got it.

38:10.369 --> 38:12.486
- Feelin' better?
- Yeah, much.

38:13.573 --> 38:15.372
Yeah.

38:15.408 --> 38:18.242
- Well, you certainly smell better.
- Well, thank goodness for that.

38:19.545 --> 38:21.545
So I talked to CPS,

38:21.581 --> 38:24.498
and I guess they've already
got a family for Poppy,

38:24.550 --> 38:26.333
which is good.

38:26.385 --> 38:29.303
And um, I have a number
to give you, for Ximena.

38:31.424 --> 38:32.590
That's great.

38:32.592 --> 38:34.425
They were gonna take her away,

38:34.427 --> 38:36.260
and like, I turned around,

38:36.262 --> 38:37.561
and AJ was right there

38:37.597 --> 38:41.182
and... I didn't have time to...

38:41.234 --> 38:43.484
So you... you were coming to the car?

38:43.519 --> 38:44.519
Yeah.

38:46.489 --> 38:50.574
Honest to God, there is nothing
between me and AJ anymore.

38:52.528 --> 38:54.495
Okay. Good.

38:55.581 --> 38:59.450
- I care about you, so much.
- You, too.

39:01.204 --> 39:02.286
But...

39:03.623 --> 39:05.172
But...

39:05.208 --> 39:10.127
But I think we need to
take a big step back.

39:10.179 --> 39:12.213
Oh... okay.

39:12.265 --> 39:15.466
We jumped into things
pretty fast, you know,

39:15.518 --> 39:20.387
and I think we both have
trust issues because of it.

39:20.439 --> 39:24.475
And it's making us be
really nasty to each other.

39:26.479 --> 39:29.313
And I think that...

39:29.315 --> 39:33.367
if we want this to...

39:33.402 --> 39:36.403
you know, last, or be something good,

39:36.455 --> 39:39.240
we need to rebuild it,

39:39.292 --> 39:40.624
from the ground up.

39:42.461 --> 39:44.578
Starting as friends.

39:44.630 --> 39:46.247
For now.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.383
What... what do you think?

39:49.418 --> 39:51.168
Um...

39:53.306 --> 39:55.339
I think you're right.

39:55.391 --> 39:58.392
I mean, it's not like the
fairy tale, or whatever,

39:58.427 --> 40:01.512
but... fairy tales never last, so...

40:01.564 --> 40:03.314
friends it is.

40:03.349 --> 40:04.515
For now.

40:12.525 --> 40:14.275
Hey, how you doin'?

40:14.327 --> 40:17.444
I'm definitely gonna get a
little stir crazy in here,

40:17.496 --> 40:19.496
but um, I'm doing okay for now.

40:19.532 --> 40:21.332
Good, um,

40:21.367 --> 40:25.252
so, I've been working on,
like, a profile of you,

40:25.288 --> 40:27.504
just using the footage
that we took last night,

40:27.540 --> 40:31.592
and then the video that Mariana
took of Poppy and your parents.

40:31.627 --> 40:33.427
And I'm editing something together

40:33.462 --> 40:35.512
that we can put up online
for people to pass along

40:35.548 --> 40:37.431
so that they know your story.

40:37.466 --> 40:39.516
I wanted to make sure
that's cool with you.

40:39.552 --> 40:41.685
Oh, yeah, of course, thank you.

40:41.721 --> 40:43.437
Have you found Poppy?

40:43.472 --> 40:45.389
I mean, do we know if she's okay?

40:45.441 --> 40:47.691
Why don't you ask her yourself?

40:49.312 --> 40:50.561
Oh, my God!

40:50.563 --> 40:53.397
Hey! I just got here!

40:53.399 --> 40:55.482
Hi, Poppy.

40:55.534 --> 40:58.285
She's gonna be staying
with us until you get out.

40:58.321 --> 41:00.454
Um, we're fostering her.

41:00.489 --> 41:02.406
Oh, my God...

41:03.542 --> 41:05.459
It's okay, you don't
have to say anything,

41:05.494 --> 41:08.495
just... you won't be
going through this alone.

41:08.547 --> 41:10.464
I promise.

41:10.499 --> 41:12.216
You have all of us...

41:12.251 --> 41:14.418
Hi, Ximena!

41:14.420 --> 41:15.420
Thank you!

41:15.471 --> 41:17.388
Hang in there, girl!

41:17.423 --> 41:20.507
I'm gonna come by later with some
food and stuff for you to do, okay?

41:20.559 --> 41:22.599
Oh, and I'm gonna bring
your roller skates!
