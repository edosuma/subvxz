WEBVTT

00:54.163 --> 00:56.398
God, I love America, hmm?

00:58.167 --> 01:01.170
Every single Godforsaken bite of
it.

01:06.008 --> 01:08.443
It's the only country
that actively condones

01:08.477 --> 01:10.213
diabetes and obesity.

01:16.485 --> 01:20.322
You know, my grandparents
came to this country

01:21.924 --> 01:24.694
literally fighting their
way outta Germany and Italy

01:24.727 --> 01:26.394
during World War II.

01:28.363 --> 01:29.165
They weren't given a cent

01:29.198 --> 01:31.134
when they went through Ellis
Island.

01:31.167 --> 01:35.238
It was like, hey, thanks
for coming to the US.

01:35.270 --> 01:39.809
Here's another fucking
boat, take you to New York.

01:39.842 --> 01:43.079
Oh yeah, but don't
worry, because if the

01:43.112 --> 01:44.814
28-degree weather doesn't kill
you,

01:44.847 --> 01:47.649
then you'll either get,
you know, robbed and beaten

01:47.683 --> 01:51.053
within an inch of your life
or you'll just get robbed

01:51.087 --> 01:54.857
so you're left with less
than what you came here with.

01:54.891 --> 01:57.359
Unless, of course, you're
one of those lucky ones

01:57.392 --> 01:59.195
that's actually able
to find a job and live

01:59.228 --> 02:02.732
in the back of a Goddamn
dumpster for months on end

02:02.765 --> 02:05.935
to try to escape the gangs and
the cold.

02:05.968 --> 02:10.472
Oh, and you gotta learn
English, all at the same time.

02:14.811 --> 02:16.712
And when that happened, you
really think

02:16.746 --> 02:18.413
the first fucking thing on their
mind's

02:18.446 --> 02:20.382
being health-conscious?

02:22.985 --> 02:24.419
Hell, no.

02:24.954 --> 02:27.790
When your diet consists
of bread and cheap meat,

02:27.824 --> 02:32.594
the last thing on your mind
is obesity or eating healthy.

02:33.296 --> 02:35.298
I mean, hell, you were
lucky to make it alive

02:35.330 --> 02:37.166
just to be fucking 50.

02:37.834 --> 02:41.237
So, you know,

02:41.270 --> 02:45.440
yeah, America, I salute you

02:46.108 --> 02:49.078
for your obesity and your
ignorance to poison children

02:49.111 --> 02:54.016
on a daily basis with your
$1.25 cafeteria fucking lunches.

03:03.292 --> 03:07.362
You know, it's not gonna
refill itself over here.

03:22.044 --> 03:24.512
Can I get you anything else?

03:28.951 --> 03:32.587
I'm not even close to
finished, and you're here

03:32.621 --> 03:36.359
ready to pile on more
grease and cholesterol.

03:37.559 --> 03:40.096
No, I was...

03:40.129 --> 03:41.931
Oh, I get it.

03:41.964 --> 03:45.467
You're seeing if I'm ready for
the check?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.103
No, I was simply just seeing

03:47.136 --> 03:49.872
if I could get you anything
else.

03:56.879 --> 03:58.513
Cream, please.

04:07.990 --> 04:08.824
Thank you.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.773
Anybody sitting here?

04:27.910 --> 04:29.812
Hey, can I get you anything?

04:29.845 --> 04:31.414
Just coffee.

04:32.348 --> 04:33.749
Cream and sugar?

04:33.783 --> 04:35.952
Black's fine, thank you.

04:43.859 --> 04:45.261
Thank you.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.052
What?

05:10.753 --> 05:12.688
I'm here as a courtesy to let
you know

05:12.722 --> 05:15.324
you need to settle up
your debt with Bunny.

05:19.261 --> 05:21.797
Who the fuck are you?

05:21.831 --> 05:23.598
Who the fuck I am doesn't
matter.

05:23.631 --> 05:25.600
What matters is that you've
been given ample opportunity

05:25.633 --> 05:27.970
to pay back a debt that you owe.

05:28.004 --> 05:29.637
Now if you can't afford to pay
it back,

05:29.671 --> 05:32.108
we'll figure out some
kinda payment arrangement,

05:32.141 --> 05:35.978
but like I said, Jeff,
I'm here as a courtesy.

05:37.246 --> 05:38.447
Mm hm.

05:43.252 --> 05:45.054
Yeah, I'll pay it.

05:45.087 --> 05:45.888
Good.

05:45.921 --> 05:46.889
Great.

05:46.922 --> 05:49.358
When can I tell Bunny
you'll have her 135k?

05:49.959 --> 05:53.661
Buddy, I can pay it, okay?

05:54.463 --> 05:56.564
But Jesus Christ, I don't
have that kinda fuckin' cash.

05:56.598 --> 05:58.801
What are you, Goddamn crazy?

05:58.834 --> 06:00.635
You got till the end of the
month.

06:00.668 --> 06:02.905
Saturday the 30th, midnight.

06:02.938 --> 06:05.174
You know the place, don't you?

06:05.207 --> 06:06.275
Mm hm.

06:06.308 --> 06:10.379
Yeah, assume you'll be
there one way or the other.

06:14.884 --> 06:16.385
Oh, and, uh, Jeff?

06:17.286 --> 06:19.288
I'd suggest not leaving town.

06:19.321 --> 06:22.291
That's probably the worst thing
you could do for yourself.

06:28.563 --> 06:29.398
Fucking Prick.

06:36.472 --> 06:37.306
Jesus.

06:41.343 --> 06:43.813
Hey, can I get some more fuckin'
coffee?

07:04.900 --> 07:06.202
Fuck.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.839
Broke my fuckin' nose.

07:11.207 --> 07:13.342
You have to hold your head
back to keep it from bleeding.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.609
Yeah, I know.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.715
Did you find it?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.952
I found the safe.

07:24.286 --> 07:26.388
But there was nothing in it
except

07:26.422 --> 07:28.524
for some papers and this.

07:33.729 --> 07:34.530
That's it?

07:34.563 --> 07:35.898
Yeah.

07:41.604 --> 07:42.438
Fuck.

08:00.122 --> 08:01.957
Where's Tim?

08:04.593 --> 08:05.828
I don't know.

08:07.396 --> 08:08.197
Over there somewhere.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.065
You left him in there by
himself?

08:10.099 --> 08:14.403
It's not like the fucking
guy is going anywhere.

08:14.436 --> 08:15.838
Tim, come here.

08:19.308 --> 08:20.109
You find anything?

08:20.142 --> 08:20.843
No, not yet.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.244
I need you to go out to his car,

08:22.278 --> 08:24.813
find a rag and some cleaner,
wipe it down, all of it.

08:24.847 --> 08:26.448
What about him?

08:26.482 --> 08:27.783
He's not going anywhere.

09:07.556 --> 09:08.490
House wins

09:24.873 --> 09:26.676
Hey, help!

09:26.710 --> 09:27.543
Help!

09:27.810 --> 09:28.611
Help me!

09:28.644 --> 09:29.445
Help!

09:29.478 --> 09:30.279
Hey, help!

09:30.312 --> 09:32.214
You shut the fuck up.

09:32.815 --> 09:33.717
- Shut the fuck...
- Help!

09:35.150 --> 09:35.985
No

09:38.053 --> 09:38.988
Shut up.

09:39.021 --> 09:40.356
Sit here before I decide to roll
you

09:40.389 --> 09:43.025
on the ground and hogtie
you, you little bastard.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.029
I really wish you wouldn'ta
lied to me

10:20.062 --> 10:21.731
about the safe, Bob.

10:22.464 --> 10:23.532
Fuck You.

10:23.565 --> 10:25.601
I was really looking
forward to finding something

10:25.634 --> 10:28.370
a little more worthwhile than
this.

10:28.404 --> 10:29.204
Fuck.

10:36.045 --> 10:38.414
You wouldn't happen to have
any idea

10:38.447 --> 10:39.783
where I can find the money you
have

10:39.815 --> 10:41.751
lying around, would you?

10:41.785 --> 10:43.085
God, no.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.020
'Cause you made it clear
that you had a stash going

10:45.054 --> 10:47.423
for when you left your
wife for the mistress,

10:47.456 --> 10:49.793
that she wouldn't leave you
totally broke.

10:56.932 --> 10:57.833
Fuck you.

11:13.817 --> 11:14.650
Stan.

11:17.687 --> 11:18.654
Thanks.

11:18.688 --> 11:21.223
Thought you might want some
coffee.

11:21.256 --> 11:23.827
So what'd you wanna meet about?

11:25.361 --> 11:26.295
Figured you'd come into the
office

11:26.328 --> 11:27.930
to sign the papers.

11:31.967 --> 11:32.968
I'm broke.

11:34.536 --> 11:35.371
100%.

11:36.372 --> 11:39.475
Minus a few assets that are
getting ready to be taken

11:39.508 --> 11:42.277
and some cash I have hidden
away.

11:43.212 --> 11:44.313
What do you think my chances are

11:44.346 --> 11:48.016
that she won't gut me for
everything I have left?

11:48.050 --> 11:50.185
Cash on the books?

11:50.219 --> 11:51.721
What other assets?

11:53.155 --> 11:55.924
Cash was skimmed off
the top of the business.

11:55.958 --> 11:57.192
Unless someone does some major
digging

11:57.226 --> 11:59.561
when we tank, it won't show.

12:02.131 --> 12:06.703
And assets are the house,
couple cars, few small items.

12:08.036 --> 12:09.171
You two good with just coffee,

12:09.204 --> 12:10.807
or do you want something else?

12:10.840 --> 12:12.174
Coffee's fine.

12:24.821 --> 12:26.955
I told you to have her sign
a prenup, but either way,

12:26.989 --> 12:31.393
when the company goes
under, stocks'll plummet,

12:31.427 --> 12:35.464
the house'll be gone,
most likely the cars.

12:35.497 --> 12:37.867
Now if she knows about the cash,

12:37.901 --> 12:40.737
that could cause quite a
stir if she tells anyone.

12:40.770 --> 12:42.204
She's clueless.

12:43.105 --> 12:45.708
Only thing she's worried about
is the gym.

12:45.742 --> 12:48.076
Whatever guy she's screwing.

12:49.244 --> 12:51.881
You know she's screwing
around?

12:51.915 --> 12:54.082
I have a feeling she is.

12:55.017 --> 12:59.021
But she knows I'm screwing
around on her, so it evens out.

12:59.054 --> 13:02.057
Bob, does she know about the
cash?

13:04.960 --> 13:05.829
I think she might know.

13:05.862 --> 13:06.962
I...

13:06.995 --> 13:10.700
Might and does are two
completely different things.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.334
If she says something, you're
looking

13:12.367 --> 13:14.503
at a world of hurt from the
feds.

13:14.536 --> 13:15.939
Now we already know they're
gonna indict

13:15.971 --> 13:17.105
on the fraud charges.

13:17.139 --> 13:18.307
Now luckily...

13:20.944 --> 13:23.378
I don't think they have much.

13:25.247 --> 13:26.148
It'll go to trial.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.785
I'm, I'm pretty sure we can win
as long as

13:28.818 --> 13:30.619
we can keep her off the stand.

13:30.652 --> 13:33.222
How bad could it be, come on?

13:33.255 --> 13:35.657
Could it be, or will it be?

13:36.726 --> 13:39.027
You're looking anywhere
between five and 20,

13:39.061 --> 13:43.065
depending on what they can
prove, if she hits the stand.

13:43.098 --> 13:45.768
But only if she can provide some
proof.

13:45.802 --> 13:48.470
Well, that money is the proof.

13:50.239 --> 13:52.674
Find out how much she knows.

13:57.279 --> 13:59.849
Hypothetically, if she did...

14:02.852 --> 14:03.853
Know things?

14:08.290 --> 14:09.792
If she knew things
and you didn't want her

14:09.826 --> 14:11.828
to know things, these types of
things.

14:11.861 --> 14:12.695
Right.

14:16.298 --> 14:18.467
I'm sure you could figure
something out.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.102
Don't you think so?

14:22.137 --> 14:25.942
Happy hour.

14:28.310 --> 14:31.413
I'll stop by later to sign the
papers.

14:31.446 --> 14:33.415
Thanks for meeting.

14:33.448 --> 14:35.183
You forgetting something?

14:35.217 --> 14:38.554
Oh, right.

14:42.057 --> 14:45.160
I think I can figure something
out.

14:59.876 --> 15:01.510
Fuck.

15:09.752 --> 15:13.022
Come here.

15:14.590 --> 15:17.426
Fuck.

15:18.695 --> 15:19.494
You ready?

15:19.528 --> 15:20.562
No I'm not fucking ready.

15:20.596 --> 15:21.965
Okay, I'm gonna count to
three.

15:22.832 --> 15:23.632
One.

15:24.499 --> 15:25.300
Two.

15:27.235 --> 15:28.370
Three.

15:28.403 --> 15:29.237
Fuck.

15:37.714 --> 15:39.581
Is it straight?

15:39.615 --> 15:42.018
Straight as it's gonna get.

16:03.773 --> 16:04.606
Hello?

16:07.944 --> 16:08.778
Hey...

16:10.145 --> 16:11.781
What are you doing?

16:11.814 --> 16:13.415
I think there's someone in the
trunk.

16:13.448 --> 16:14.282
What?

16:18.420 --> 16:19.254
Shit!

16:20.389 --> 16:22.792
There's someone in the trunk!

16:23.760 --> 16:24.559
Who is it?

16:24.593 --> 16:26.261
How should I know?

16:32.969 --> 16:35.537
You think he kidnapped
someone?

16:35.570 --> 16:37.472
I don't fucking know.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.478
Where do you think the keys
are at?

16:43.512 --> 16:45.114
Bob has the keys.

17:17.646 --> 17:19.749
Now you listen to me.

17:19.781 --> 17:21.818
I'm gonna take this duct tape
off,

17:21.851 --> 17:24.286
and you're gonna tell me
where the fuckin' money is,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.189
and you're not gonna scream.

17:26.221 --> 17:29.125
Otherwise, I'm gonna break every
one

17:29.158 --> 17:31.894
of your fuckin' toes, one by
one.

17:32.895 --> 17:34.629
Do you understand me?

17:36.199 --> 17:37.432
All right.

17:37.466 --> 17:38.300
All right.

17:47.877 --> 17:50.813
Oh God.

17:51.814 --> 17:53.648
You want some water?

17:55.484 --> 17:56.318
Yeah.

17:57.586 --> 17:59.521
All right, all right.

18:02.491 --> 18:03.826
That's progress.

18:13.568 --> 18:15.537
Aw, you're a fuckin' choker,
huh?

18:15.570 --> 18:19.075
Yeah, my ex had the same fuckin'
problem.

18:23.846 --> 18:24.847
Listen, Bob.

18:26.048 --> 18:27.850
I know that your fuckin'
wife is gonna be home

18:27.884 --> 18:30.720
in the next two hours or so.

18:30.753 --> 18:32.255
It's getting late, all right?

18:32.287 --> 18:33.990
I want to sleep in my
own fuckin' bed tonight,

18:34.023 --> 18:36.893
and you, listen, you should
probably go

18:36.926 --> 18:38.928
to a hospital at some point.

18:38.961 --> 18:42.231
So you know, where's the fuckin'
money?

18:44.100 --> 18:44.901
Come here.

18:45.768 --> 18:46.601
Come closer.

18:46.635 --> 18:47.737
C'mere.

18:47.770 --> 18:48.570
All right, all right.

18:48.603 --> 18:51.741
Fuck you!

18:51.774 --> 18:53.709
Get the fuck out of my house!

19:00.448 --> 19:01.483
Fuck!

19:02.251 --> 19:03.085
Oh my God.

19:03.953 --> 19:04.787
Oh my God.

19:07.622 --> 19:09.292
Fuckin' piece a shit!

19:13.395 --> 19:14.797
Shut the fuck up!

19:18.000 --> 19:19.101
Shut up, Bob!

19:23.940 --> 19:25.507
Fuckin', Goddammit.

19:32.148 --> 19:33.082
Ow!

19:33.950 --> 19:34.750
Hold fucking still!

19:34.784 --> 19:36.052
Ow, motherfucker.

19:37.186 --> 19:38.054
I told you.

19:38.087 --> 19:39.789
I fuckin' told you.

19:39.822 --> 19:40.622
Now shut the fuck up.

19:47.797 --> 19:49.232
Hey, Jeff.

19:50.532 --> 19:51.466
What?

19:51.499 --> 19:52.500
Come here.

20:05.715 --> 20:06.514
Hey.

20:07.382 --> 20:08.617
Don't fucking move.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.387
Piece o' shit.

20:18.327 --> 20:19.494
What?

20:19.527 --> 20:22.131
Yeah, so there's someone in
Bob's trunk.

20:22.164 --> 20:22.965
What do you mean?

20:22.999 --> 20:24.466
What do you mean what do I
mean?

20:24.499 --> 20:28.403
I mean, there's a woman
trapped in Bob's trunk.

20:29.205 --> 20:30.106
Well, who is she?

20:30.139 --> 20:31.207
How the fuck should I know?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.674
I didn't open it.

20:34.877 --> 20:35.845
Well, where are the keys?

20:35.878 --> 20:37.646
She says Bob has 'em,
but do you really think

20:37.680 --> 20:39.181
we should open it?

20:41.717 --> 20:42.952
I don't know.

20:42.985 --> 20:45.154
We can't just leave her in
there.

20:45.187 --> 20:46.789
She'll suffocate.

20:46.822 --> 20:49.725
I'm kinda thinking
that might be the idea.

20:49.759 --> 20:52.094
Why don't we just ask Bob?

20:52.929 --> 20:54.931
Well, there's an idea.

21:05.408 --> 21:06.242
Ow!

21:07.109 --> 21:08.210
You're missing a
toe,

21:08.244 --> 21:09.745
and you say ow to that?

21:11.013 --> 21:13.316
You cut off his toe?

21:13.349 --> 21:17.753
Yeah, he, uh, look, he
wouldn't fucking say anything.

21:17.787 --> 21:18.653
You're a sick bastard.

21:18.688 --> 21:20.189
His toe?

21:20.222 --> 21:21.489
Shut up.

21:21.523 --> 21:22.825
Who's in your trunk?

21:22.858 --> 21:24.260
My wife.

21:24.293 --> 21:25.361
Your wife?

21:25.394 --> 21:27.129
That's what I said.

21:30.967 --> 21:33.102
Why's your wife in your trunk?

21:33.135 --> 21:38.140
I'm not going to
tell you shit.

21:42.311 --> 21:43.578
You hear him?

21:44.579 --> 21:45.748
I say we let her out.

21:45.781 --> 21:48.550
Oh yeah, I say we let her out.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.786
Hey, now I'm guessing she's
probably

21:50.820 --> 21:52.922
not too happy with you right
now, huh?

21:52.955 --> 21:55.691
Well, maybe she'll help
us out with this money.

21:55.725 --> 21:56.859
Where are the keys?

21:56.892 --> 21:59.362
I don't think that's a
good idea to let her out.

21:59.395 --> 22:02.064
Oh, Bob, I think this is the
best idea

22:02.098 --> 22:03.766
we've had all night.

22:05.401 --> 22:06.869
Now where are the keys before I
tear off

22:06.902 --> 22:08.570
another fuckin' toe?

22:10.473 --> 22:11.639
Left pocket.

22:17.512 --> 22:18.914
Excuse me.

22:18.948 --> 22:19.782
Yeah.

22:29.191 --> 22:30.525
Fuck you, Bob.

22:32.795 --> 22:35.097
Uh, hey, uh, listen.

22:35.331 --> 22:36.598
If we let you outta there,

22:36.631 --> 22:38.501
you're not gonna do anything
crazy, right?

22:38.533 --> 22:40.302
No, please.

22:40.336 --> 22:41.470
Please, just let me out.

22:41.504 --> 22:43.939
It's getting hard to breathe.

22:51.613 --> 22:52.448
Fuck.

23:23.712 --> 23:25.848
Can you help me out?

23:29.151 --> 23:29.952
Hey, uh...

23:29.985 --> 23:30.786
Yeah.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.154
Grab her legs.

23:33.823 --> 23:35.157
Swing 'em, yeah.

23:36.358 --> 23:37.860
Come here.

23:37.893 --> 23:39.228
Okay, come here.

23:40.830 --> 23:42.398
Okay, set her down.

23:44.100 --> 23:44.934
Okay.

23:47.236 --> 23:49.505
You must, uh, be the wife.

23:49.538 --> 23:51.273
Soon-to-be ex-wife.

23:52.775 --> 23:55.111
Right, uh, sorry, ex-wife.

23:56.712 --> 24:00.382
So hey, listen, we're
uh, we're sort of, uh,

24:02.451 --> 24:04.053
in the middle of robbing
your husband, here.

24:04.086 --> 24:07.089
Soon-to-be ex, ex-husband.

24:07.123 --> 24:09.725
Ex-husband, right, all right.

24:13.062 --> 24:17.566
So listen, we gotta, we gotta
keep you tied up, sorry.

24:19.634 --> 24:21.504
We gotta get you in the other
room.

24:21.537 --> 24:23.739
Let's stand you up.

24:23.772 --> 24:24.573
Ready?

24:24.607 --> 24:25.574
All right, here we go, standing
up.

24:25.608 --> 24:27.209
Okay, just grab her legs.

24:27.243 --> 24:29.845
That's good, now lean back.

24:29.879 --> 24:31.514
There you go.

24:34.884 --> 24:35.718
Relax!

24:35.751 --> 24:36.785
Relax, relax!

24:46.061 --> 24:46.862
Just...

24:46.896 --> 24:47.730
Relax.

24:50.633 --> 24:51.467
All right.

24:54.436 --> 24:55.271
All right.

24:59.074 --> 24:59.909
Okay.

25:01.143 --> 25:01.977
All right.

25:03.312 --> 25:06.649
All right, now, considering that
you two

25:07.983 --> 25:10.219
clearly hate each other, I can't
exactly,

25:10.252 --> 25:14.490
you know, use you as leverage,
so would somebody please,

25:14.523 --> 25:17.960
please, for the love of God,
just tell me

25:18.827 --> 25:21.497
where the money is in this
house?

25:21.530 --> 25:24.266
Money?

25:24.300 --> 25:25.801
You think there's money here?

25:25.834 --> 25:27.403
I've searched this house high
and low

25:27.436 --> 25:29.071
and I've never found a dime.

25:29.104 --> 25:32.174
I told you there was no money
here.

25:34.476 --> 25:35.377
What?

25:35.411 --> 25:37.980
I told you, there ain't no
money here.

25:38.013 --> 25:40.015
It's all tied up in assets and
bonds.

25:41.984 --> 25:43.118
What'd you do that for?

25:43.152 --> 25:44.320
He's lying.

25:44.353 --> 25:45.020
He has to be.

25:45.054 --> 25:46.021
We didn't come here for nothing.

25:46.055 --> 25:48.390
There's nothing, trust me.

25:49.558 --> 25:51.493
I do not believe her.

26:01.303 --> 26:02.137
Oh, God.

26:04.139 --> 26:04.974
Fuck!

26:06.208 --> 26:07.042
All right.

26:09.311 --> 26:10.379
Tim.

26:10.412 --> 26:11.447
Hey, come here, hey.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.784
I need you to stay here
and watch these two, okay?

26:15.818 --> 26:16.619
Yeah.

26:16.652 --> 26:17.453
All right, all right.

26:17.486 --> 26:19.388
You come with me.

26:19.421 --> 26:22.024
I'm gonna tear this Goddamn
house apart.

26:22.057 --> 26:23.225
Fuck you, Bob!

26:44.714 --> 26:46.882
You guys wanna watch TV?

26:54.356 --> 26:55.891
And we'll hear the latest
on the man

26:55.924 --> 26:59.528
who pointed a gun at
a television reporter.

27:53.315 --> 27:55.884
Angeles Police thought
that the murder of a young woman

27:55.918 --> 27:58.153
last March was an
isolated act of violence,

27:58.187 --> 27:59.988
but since then, they've come
to believe it was connected

28:00.022 --> 28:01.390
- to a wide-ranging...
- Hey.

28:01.423 --> 28:03.492
Series of assaults by a
killer...

28:03.525 --> 28:04.960
- Be quiet.
- Who's become known

28:05.194 --> 28:06.730
as the Night Stalker,
a killer who apparently

28:06.763 --> 28:08.163
struck again during the week.

28:08.197 --> 28:09.231
It's just that I'm, uh...

28:09.264 --> 28:10.933
Police today continued
to search for any clues...

28:10.966 --> 28:12.702
- I'm a little thirsty.
- In the near-fatal shooting

28:12.736 --> 28:13.936
of 29-year-old William Karnes

28:13.969 --> 28:15.070
and the rape of his girlfriend.

28:15.104 --> 28:16.038
They're apparently

28:16.071 --> 28:17.106
- the latest victims...
- Can I have just uh...

28:17.139 --> 28:18.440
Of the Night Stalker, thought
to be...

28:18.474 --> 28:19.975
- A little bit of water?
- Responsible now

28:20.008 --> 28:22.746
for 34 brutal attacks, 14 of
them fatal.

28:22.779 --> 28:24.113
These serial killings, once
confined

28:24.146 --> 28:26.582
to the near Los Angeles
area, are now spread

28:26.615 --> 28:29.985
over 500 miles from San
Francisco to Orange County.

28:30.018 --> 28:32.054
Just as before, the
assailant entered a house...

28:32.087 --> 28:33.655
- I'm a little tied up.
- In a quiet

28:33.690 --> 28:35.090
middle-class neighborhood
in the predawn hours...

28:35.124 --> 28:35.924
- Right.
- On Sunday

28:35.958 --> 28:36.860
via an unlocked window.

28:36.892 --> 28:37.727
Lean back.

28:37.761 --> 28:38.994
The attack had come while they
slept.

28:39.027 --> 28:40.295
Neighbors are terrified.

28:40.329 --> 28:42.699
I just sleep with my hand on
my,

28:42.732 --> 28:44.500
right by my bed and a sawed-off
shotgun,

28:44.533 --> 28:46.201
which I always have.

28:47.169 --> 28:47.970
I see.

28:48.003 --> 28:48.738
Why is that?

28:48.772 --> 28:49.471
'Cause if someone

28:49.505 --> 28:50.472
- comes into my house...
- Shit!

28:50.506 --> 28:51.673
They're not leaving.

28:51.708 --> 28:52.908
The killer, who attacked
randomly, is described as white,

28:52.941 --> 28:55.678
25 to 30 years old, with
a predominant feature

28:55.712 --> 28:57.946
- of teeth...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.448
So 5,000 fliers have been
distributed

28:59.481 --> 29:01.150
- to Los Angeles dentists...
- Did I do that?

29:01.183 --> 29:03.118
Asking for help with
identification.

29:03.152 --> 29:05.688
And last week, San Francisco
mayor Diane Feinstein

29:05.722 --> 29:07.556
announced ballistic tests
have definitely linked

29:07.589 --> 29:10.225
the murder of a man there
to the Night Stalker,

29:10.259 --> 29:12.027
but release of that
information has outraged

29:12.060 --> 29:14.697
a Los Angeles sheriff
frustrated by the difficulty

29:14.731 --> 29:17.199
of tracking a random murderer.

29:17.232 --> 29:19.736
It places this community in
jeopardy

29:19.769 --> 29:23.939
because it impedes our
ability to go forward fully

29:25.174 --> 29:27.075
with the investigation.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.446
A total of $35,000...

29:41.056 --> 29:41.891
Fuck!

29:42.892 --> 29:44.894
Fire officials in
California tonight as hundreds

29:44.928 --> 29:48.597
of thousands of forest
land continue to burn.

29:48.630 --> 29:50.065
The numbers are certainly worse.

29:50.098 --> 29:53.736
Lightning has caused
some 13,000 fires now,

29:53.770 --> 29:58.173
charring more than 334,000
acres in California alone.

29:58.207 --> 30:00.275
It's not getting better,
it's getting worse.

30:05.247 --> 30:07.115
Everyone shut the fuck up.

30:07.149 --> 30:08.083
Don't move.

30:18.393 --> 30:19.896
Tracy?

30:19.929 --> 30:20.763
Bob?

30:26.936 --> 30:27.770
Sh.

30:36.746 --> 30:37.579
Hm.

31:03.305 --> 31:05.374
Oh, God, you startled me.

31:06.341 --> 31:09.511
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you come in.

31:09.812 --> 31:11.748
I'm working on the pipes
in the back bathroom.

31:11.781 --> 31:13.515
Oh, I didn't realize.

31:13.549 --> 31:17.921
I didn't see a van or a truck
or anything in the driveway.

31:17.954 --> 31:19.488
Yeah, I'm a good friend of
Bob's.

31:19.521 --> 31:21.490
I just rode along with him.

31:21.523 --> 31:24.027
Well, where is Bob, then?

31:24.059 --> 31:26.528
He's in the back with me.

31:26.562 --> 31:27.429
It's gonna be a long night.

31:27.462 --> 31:28.865
Big mess.

31:30.532 --> 31:33.870
We're not gonna be needing this
tonight.

31:47.382 --> 31:48.718
What happened?

32:14.176 --> 32:15.177
No, oh no.

32:18.347 --> 32:20.415
What the fuck happened?

32:24.053 --> 32:26.321
She just kept backing up.

32:26.355 --> 32:28.858
Got, got startled and slipped.

32:35.898 --> 32:36.799
She dead?

32:39.802 --> 32:42.839
I don't know, Jeff, why
don't you check her pulse?

32:42.872 --> 32:43.672
Of course she's fucking dead.

32:43.706 --> 32:45.008
Look at her skull.

32:45.041 --> 32:48.543
I'm pretty sure that's skull on
the floor!

32:49.979 --> 32:52.314
Oh my God, no, no, no, no.

32:53.415 --> 32:55.250
What the fuck did you guys do?

33:04.127 --> 33:06.129
She, she's dead.

33:06.161 --> 33:07.396
We're totally fucking screwed
now!

33:07.429 --> 33:08.497
Hey!

33:08.530 --> 33:10.933
Would you just go wait in
the other fuckin' room?

33:10.967 --> 33:12.434
I fuckin' knew it, man.

33:12.467 --> 33:14.971
I knew something would go wrong.

33:15.004 --> 33:16.238
And this?

33:16.271 --> 33:17.707
This is all wrong!

33:17.740 --> 33:19.474
Look, just go in the other
room.

33:19.508 --> 33:21.744
We'll deal with this.

33:21.778 --> 33:24.981
Did you guys even find the
money yet?

33:26.248 --> 33:28.583
I told you, there's nothing!

33:31.020 --> 33:36.025
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

33:36.458 --> 33:39.528
Hey, look, we just need to leave
now.

33:46.803 --> 33:47.804
No, not yet.

33:50.338 --> 33:54.010
Now go wait in the other
fuckin' room, okay?

33:59.782 --> 34:01.851
Listen, listen, listen.

34:04.821 --> 34:07.289
This, this, this is all wrong.

34:07.322 --> 34:08.157
All of it!

34:25.474 --> 34:27.976
Dude, I'm pretty sure she's
dead.

34:28.010 --> 34:30.713
How heavy do you think she is?

34:30.746 --> 34:32.414
I don't know, why?

34:36.686 --> 34:40.857
I mean, she can't weigh
more than, what, 130, 140?

34:40.889 --> 34:41.991
Why?

34:42.024 --> 34:43.358
Well, we can't just leave her
here.

34:43.391 --> 34:44.226
Sure we can.

34:44.259 --> 34:45.327
We're not murderers.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.196
She slipped and fell.

34:47.230 --> 34:48.731
Barry.

34:48.764 --> 34:49.598
Come on, man.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.702
We're in this thing deep now,
okay,

34:52.735 --> 34:55.670
whether you like it or not, huh?

34:55.705 --> 34:57.874
What do you propose we do?

34:59.075 --> 35:01.911
Well,...

35:03.112 --> 35:04.247
Fuck.

35:04.279 --> 35:06.816
We could, uh, we could saw her
up.

35:06.849 --> 35:09.152
I'm not sawing up a dead body!

35:09.185 --> 35:10.153
Not gonna happen!

35:10.186 --> 35:11.653
All right!

35:11.687 --> 35:12.722
It was an option.

35:12.755 --> 35:14.991
I thought I'd throw it out
there.

35:15.024 --> 35:16.092
We could...

35:20.696 --> 35:22.231
We could roll her up.

35:22.265 --> 35:24.167
We could roll her up in one of
those, uh,

35:24.200 --> 35:26.102
the fuckin', fancy rug.

35:27.369 --> 35:29.105
You know, at some
point, we're gonna have

35:29.138 --> 35:34.010
to discuss what to do with
the other two down there.

35:37.814 --> 35:38.647
Tim!

35:39.481 --> 35:40.283
Tim!

35:40.315 --> 35:41.951
We need you.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.753
Come here, Goddamnit.

35:49.258 --> 35:50.993
You, you are in this!

35:52.795 --> 35:54.396
Look, man, you're in it.

35:54.429 --> 35:55.231
Okay!

35:55.264 --> 35:56.565
Well, what are you thinking,
huh?

35:56.598 --> 35:58.366
What's your big plan?

35:58.400 --> 35:59.434
- We just...
- We do not

35:59.467 --> 36:01.469
have time for this shit.

36:07.677 --> 36:09.377
We're working on it, okay?

36:09.411 --> 36:10.478
Hey, right?

36:13.749 --> 36:15.852
We're working on it, okay?

36:16.752 --> 36:21.757
Listen to me, I am not gonna
let anything happen to you.

36:22.091 --> 36:24.060
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

36:24.093 --> 36:25.594
Or to anyone else.

38:38.626 --> 38:39.695
Used cars.

38:39.729 --> 38:41.897
Hey, man, what are you up to
tonight?

38:41.931 --> 38:46.435
Nothing, especially if my
day keeps going like this.

38:47.336 --> 38:49.305
I hate it when parents come in

38:49.338 --> 38:53.575
with their asshole teenagers to
buy a car.

38:53.608 --> 38:54.977
Yeah, well, you ever
think your shitty attitude

38:55.011 --> 38:57.612
has something to do with
you not getting a sale?

38:57.645 --> 38:58.914
There's a chance of that.

38:58.948 --> 38:59.815
What do you want, brother?

38:59.849 --> 39:00.783
I have shit to do.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.018
I got a proposition for you.

39:02.051 --> 39:05.321
Might help get you outta
some of your money troubles.

39:05.354 --> 39:07.589
Sure, but don't expect me
to go to the track again.

39:07.622 --> 39:10.126
Nah, it's nothing like that.

39:12.261 --> 39:14.797
Can you, uh, meet me at
Stockman's tonight

39:14.830 --> 39:16.499
for a beer at seven?

39:42.725 --> 39:44.592
How long you been up?

39:44.626 --> 39:46.529
Um, a couple minutes.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.536
Then why are you wearing
clothes?

39:55.137 --> 39:57.139
Why the fuck are you wearing
clothes?

39:58.174 --> 40:01.811
Seemed like the thing
to do before you got up.

40:14.490 --> 40:15.291
Well, now I'm awake.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.734
Yes, you are.

40:31.740 --> 40:33.008
You wanted to see me?

40:33.042 --> 40:36.278
Yeah, Barry, come on in, have
a seat.

40:48.090 --> 40:51.227
Hey, Barry, why don't
you take a look at this?

40:52.795 --> 40:53.596
Take a look right here.

40:53.628 --> 40:56.132
You see where Mike and Colleen

40:57.466 --> 41:00.236
really knock it out of the park?

41:00.269 --> 41:03.739
Here, take, take a closer look
right here.

41:04.974 --> 41:06.876
You see, Barry, this is where
you just keep falling off

41:06.909 --> 41:09.478
and finally fall off dead last.

41:15.751 --> 41:18.387
I'm gonna have to let you go.

41:18.420 --> 41:19.788
I need to make for someone

41:19.822 --> 41:20.956
who's a little more interested

41:20.990 --> 41:23.759
in getting customers in the
door.

41:32.268 --> 41:34.403
You know, I hated
this fucking job anyway.

41:34.436 --> 41:35.504
Yeah, here.

41:48.684 --> 41:52.555
What do you care, you fucking
asshole?

42:03.465 --> 42:07.703
Listen, you can rot in hell
for all I fucking care.

42:23.619 --> 42:24.853
Oh, fuck!

42:24.887 --> 42:25.721
Come on!

42:41.203 --> 42:42.137
Come on.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.342
What was that?

42:53.749 --> 42:54.750
Where's Tim?

43:03.559 --> 43:05.861
Hey, where the fuck is the
woman at?

43:18.540 --> 43:19.375
Shit!

43:27.016 --> 43:28.017
Oh my God.

43:37.694 --> 43:42.097
Hey, doesn't he ever wonder
where you are at night?

43:46.368 --> 43:47.202
No.

43:48.203 --> 43:51.106
He's too busy
worrying about screwing

43:51.140 --> 43:54.310
his secretary and moving money
around.

43:55.377 --> 43:56.211
Mm.

44:01.216 --> 44:03.552
Fucking irony is astounding.

44:05.487 --> 44:06.422
Uh, what?

44:08.457 --> 44:10.292
You know, secretary.

44:12.394 --> 44:13.395
Mm, right.

44:32.281 --> 44:35.150
How much money did you
say that he keeps on hand?

44:35.184 --> 44:37.519
Least half a million, why?

44:49.898 --> 44:52.368
Because that is a lotta cash

44:53.302 --> 44:55.805
to just keep lying around, hm?

44:56.939 --> 44:59.274
Yeah, well, he's paranoid.

45:03.879 --> 45:06.683
He hides everything from me.

45:11.387 --> 45:14.523
Well, I know he's got it
somewhere.

45:14.556 --> 45:15.391
Who knows?

45:24.066 --> 45:29.071
I know his lawyer is trying to
hide everything else from me.

45:29.405 --> 45:32.074
So he may have already moved it.

45:41.350 --> 45:42.151
Hey.

45:42.184 --> 45:43.118
Hm?

45:43.152 --> 45:45.387
When is everything final?

45:46.588 --> 45:48.858
Soon as the deal is done.

45:50.727 --> 45:51.728
I want half.

45:53.395 --> 45:58.333
I deserve half for putting
up with this shit this long.

46:00.068 --> 46:00.904
Mm hm.

46:04.173 --> 46:06.341
Am I gonna see you tonight?

46:06.375 --> 46:08.510
I can't tonight.

46:08.544 --> 46:09.378
Why?

46:10.212 --> 46:13.081
He's got that fundraiser
thing.

46:13.115 --> 46:16.285
Needs me there to keep up
appearances.

46:28.263 --> 46:29.064
Hey.

46:29.097 --> 46:29.933
Mm?

46:31.300 --> 46:33.402
You gonna be okay till
Thursday not seeing me?

46:33.435 --> 46:35.270
I don't know.

46:50.452 --> 46:52.054
I'll figure it out.

47:02.464 --> 47:03.298
See ya.

47:06.903 --> 47:07.804
Yeah, later.

47:20.683 --> 47:22.084
Oh my God.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.991
I, I tripped, and, the gun went
off!

47:28.023 --> 47:29.191
You tripped?

47:30.526 --> 47:32.594
And hit her right in the skull?

47:32.628 --> 47:35.297
Well, I was running after her.

47:36.833 --> 47:40.068
Look, I don't know how it
happened, okay?

47:46.174 --> 47:49.946
Well, what the fuck do you
wanna do now, huh, huh?

47:49.979 --> 47:50.914
I didn't mean to kill her.

47:50.947 --> 47:53.315
We know you didn't mean to,
but now

47:53.348 --> 47:54.851
we have to do something with
her.

47:54.884 --> 47:56.853
We can't just leave her here.

48:06.361 --> 48:07.964
You answer me this.

48:09.732 --> 48:13.468
How in the world, if
you were watching her,

48:13.502 --> 48:16.940
did, uh, she manage to get
loose,

48:16.973 --> 48:18.875
and run out the fucking back
door?

48:18.908 --> 48:20.175
I don't know!

48:21.978 --> 48:23.278
It all happened so fast.

48:23.312 --> 48:24.379
I don't know!

48:28.183 --> 48:29.018
Okay.

48:30.319 --> 48:31.153
Okay.

48:35.324 --> 48:39.062
Wasn't he trying to
kill her anyway, huh?

48:39.094 --> 48:42.732
Why don't we just put
her back in the trunk?

48:42.765 --> 48:44.199
He has a point.

48:45.400 --> 48:49.638
This thing goes any more
South, it, it gives us an out.

48:49.671 --> 48:50.505
Yeah.

48:52.674 --> 48:53.508
Well...

48:54.711 --> 48:55.712
It's not like we have much

48:55.745 --> 48:59.015
of a fucking choice now, is
there, huh?

49:09.058 --> 49:09.859
Fuck!

49:12.729 --> 49:13.562
Oh, shit.

49:19.134 --> 49:19.936
Fucking.

49:45.494 --> 49:47.096
Hey, right, don't step
on the fucking body.

49:47.130 --> 49:48.131
I see her.

49:54.904 --> 49:55.705
Fuck!

49:56.773 --> 49:58.007
Ah, ah, shit.

50:00.509 --> 50:01.811
Where the fuck is that gun?

50:01.844 --> 50:04.147
I don't really give a shit.

50:12.021 --> 50:14.456
Who's got the fucking keys?

50:21.030 --> 50:22.264
I don't have 'em.

50:23.132 --> 50:24.633
I don't fucking have 'em.

50:24.666 --> 50:25.634
You've got 'em.

50:25.667 --> 50:26.803
Goddamnit!

50:26.836 --> 50:27.669
Fuck!

50:31.473 --> 50:32.307
Ah, God.

50:35.277 --> 50:36.411
I got it.

50:38.781 --> 50:39.614
Fuck!

50:50.392 --> 50:51.194
Ah, fuck.

50:52.729 --> 50:53.528
All right.

50:53.562 --> 50:54.697
Put her, uh, put her head in
first.

51:40.777 --> 51:42.812
You think he'll be all right?

51:42.845 --> 51:45.915
What do you wanna do with the
body?

51:53.288 --> 51:54.824
I say we just put her in the
trunk.

51:54.857 --> 51:55.691
Okay.

52:00.295 --> 52:02.231
Right, one, two, three.

52:05.433 --> 52:08.603
Why's she gotta be so Goddamn
heavy?

52:25.254 --> 52:27.123
You think she's heavy,
you have the light end.

52:27.156 --> 52:28.490
Light, my ass.

52:31.727 --> 52:33.196
Come on, set her down, set her
down.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.368
What's wrong?

52:40.402 --> 52:42.738
Nah, just, bitch is heavy.

52:46.676 --> 52:49.145
Can we just please get
her in the Goddamn trunk

52:49.178 --> 52:52.447
so we can finish what we came
here for?

52:53.983 --> 52:54.817
Jesus.

53:03.793 --> 53:04.626
All right.

53:08.998 --> 53:09.832
Ready?

53:10.700 --> 53:13.169
Okay, one, two, three.

53:17.940 --> 53:19.275
No, I say head first.

53:19.308 --> 53:20.276
No way, man.

53:20.309 --> 53:21.409
You could put her legs
around the other head,

53:21.443 --> 53:22.444
head and neck area.

53:22.477 --> 53:24.780
Look, you put her
head in first, and then

53:24.814 --> 53:26.282
I can drape her over the other
one

53:26.315 --> 53:28.617
and shove her legs in afterward.

53:28.650 --> 53:30.286
Okay, whatever you say, man.

53:33.222 --> 53:34.023
Come on, man.

53:34.056 --> 53:34.891
I doin'.

53:37.659 --> 53:38.460
Go that way.

53:39.328 --> 53:40.329
Go that way.

53:43.531 --> 53:45.101
Hey.

53:46.501 --> 53:47.703
We gotta push her.

53:50.973 --> 53:52.275
Hey.

53:52.308 --> 53:53.142
I told ya.

53:54.810 --> 53:56.112
Close the trunk.

53:56.145 --> 53:58.480
Oh my God, man, Goddamnit.

54:02.318 --> 54:04.387
I told you she was too fuckin'
big!

54:04.419 --> 54:05.321
I'll get it.

54:05.354 --> 54:07.690
Dude, we have to move her.

54:17.033 --> 54:18.533
Fuckin' told ya.

54:18.566 --> 54:21.370
I just hope her head isn't
busted all over the place.

54:21.404 --> 54:23.005
Who gives a shit?

54:46.395 --> 54:47.196
Aw, what's up man?

54:47.229 --> 54:48.264
You look like shit.

54:52.567 --> 54:53.436
What can I get ya?

54:53.468 --> 54:54.469
Two shots.

54:55.404 --> 54:56.872
I hope you're payin'.

54:56.906 --> 55:01.077
Oh, been a long day dear?

55:01.110 --> 55:02.544
Long fucking life, man.

55:02.577 --> 55:06.581
I thought I finally had
a sale, then poof, done.

55:08.884 --> 55:10.052
Here you go.

55:11.253 --> 55:12.154
Nine bucks.

55:13.255 --> 55:14.757
Well, don't go reaching for
your wallet

55:14.790 --> 55:16.125
too fast, Jesus.

55:21.731 --> 55:22.530
Keep it.

55:22.564 --> 55:24.767
Thank you very much.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.435
Hey, you ever think maybe
you're

55:26.469 --> 55:29.405
just not cut out to sell used
cars.

55:32.041 --> 55:33.109
Well, it's funny you mention
that.

55:33.142 --> 55:34.243
Why?

55:34.276 --> 55:38.180
They finally can your ass
for not selling anything?

55:41.250 --> 55:42.151
Well, shit.

55:43.452 --> 55:45.287
Here's to a new start

55:51.327 --> 55:53.329
That's what the fuck I'm talking
about.

55:53.362 --> 55:56.165
Hey, bartender, could I get
two beers and two more shots?

55:56.198 --> 55:58.300
Sure, what do you want?

55:58.334 --> 55:59.667
Uh, hey, do you care?

55:59.702 --> 56:00.970
No, whatever's fine.

56:01.003 --> 56:01.837
Um...

56:03.506 --> 56:04.974
Give me two Old Hangtowns.

56:05.007 --> 56:06.175
Good choice.

56:07.209 --> 56:08.110
You hear that?

56:08.144 --> 56:09.145
Good choice.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.600
You just want me to start a
tab?

56:32.634 --> 56:33.668
Just start a tab.

56:33.702 --> 56:35.471
I have a feeling we're
gonna be here for a while.

56:35.504 --> 56:36.305
Okay.

56:36.338 --> 56:37.139
Have an ID?

56:37.173 --> 56:37.973
Yeah.

56:38.007 --> 56:39.674
I need to hold it.

56:41.643 --> 56:43.045
Thank you.

56:51.020 --> 56:53.655
What are you so chipper about?

56:54.857 --> 56:56.959
I'm no more chipper than I
normally am.

56:56.992 --> 56:58.561
You seem like it.

57:02.597 --> 57:05.468
I might have something.

57:05.501 --> 57:07.403
What kinda something?

57:08.471 --> 57:09.705
Something to get your sad,
pathetic ass

57:09.738 --> 57:12.842
out of the credit card debt
you're in.

57:12.875 --> 57:15.311
You don't fucking learn, do
you?

57:15.344 --> 57:16.512
What are you talking about?

57:16.545 --> 57:19.048
What am I talking about?

57:19.081 --> 57:22.852
Well, you've been out
for what, seven months?

57:24.954 --> 57:27.056
It's not like that.

57:28.124 --> 57:29.825
It's an easy in and out.

57:29.859 --> 57:31.193
Nobody gets hurt.

57:31.227 --> 57:32.027
Hell.

57:32.061 --> 57:35.663
Nobody'll even fucking be
there.

57:35.698 --> 57:36.599
Be where?

57:39.468 --> 57:40.769
Look, we need you on this.

57:40.803 --> 57:41.370
I need you.

57:41.403 --> 57:42.805
Whoa, whoa, we?

57:43.873 --> 57:45.708
Let me guess, you've got
that little asshole Tim

57:45.741 --> 57:47.343
chasing your coattails again.

57:47.376 --> 57:49.411
Ah, whatever, man.

57:49.445 --> 57:51.213
Look, I need you on this.

57:51.247 --> 57:52.148
For what?

57:53.282 --> 57:55.784
A couple hundred dollars?

57:55.818 --> 57:57.286
Risk my neck for that shit?

57:57.319 --> 57:58.754
No way, I'm good.

58:01.056 --> 58:01.857
Yeah?

58:01.891 --> 58:03.726
What are you gonna do?

58:04.894 --> 58:06.896
What are you gonna do?

58:07.830 --> 58:09.732
You've been in and outta jobs
for years.

58:09.765 --> 58:12.301
What, are you gonna go back
to selling fuckin' used cars?

58:12.334 --> 58:13.802
I'll find something.

58:13.836 --> 58:14.669
Hm.

58:16.238 --> 58:20.176
What if that something
was $200,000, maybe more?

58:21.610 --> 58:25.714
You've never known anyone
with that kinda cash.

58:25.748 --> 58:27.650
I know a guy.

58:27.683 --> 58:30.786
He's going through a divorce,
all right?

58:30.819 --> 58:33.489
His wife is trying to take
him for everything he's got.

58:33.522 --> 58:37.126
The kicker is, she's trying to
rob him

58:37.159 --> 58:39.094
because she knows that he's
broke except

58:39.128 --> 58:42.865
for a buncha cash that
he's got in some safe.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.802
So you want to rob this guy?

58:46.835 --> 58:47.670
Yeah.

58:49.104 --> 58:49.939
Bartender.

58:52.708 --> 58:54.443
What do you need?

58:54.476 --> 58:55.444
Few more shots.

58:55.477 --> 58:56.745
I need to get drunker
to mask the stupidity

58:56.779 --> 58:58.781
coming out of his mouth.

58:59.683 --> 59:00.783
You got it.

59:02.686 --> 59:04.520
I gotta take a piss.

59:20.569 --> 59:22.004
What's up, man?

59:24.673 --> 59:28.344
You know there's no
fucking way out of this now.

59:28.377 --> 59:31.480
Hey, of course there is, all
right?

59:32.716 --> 59:36.385
Look, Bob was trying to kill
his wife when we got here,

59:36.418 --> 59:39.188
all right, so we'll
just, we'll make it look

59:39.221 --> 59:43.192
like he'll take the fall for
everything.

59:43.225 --> 59:46.629
You don't get it.

59:46.662 --> 59:49.231
I'm not a fuckin'
murderer.

59:49.265 --> 59:52.101
And none of us were until
tonight.

59:56.105 --> 59:57.741
We just need to leave.

59:57.773 --> 59:58.907
Listen, Tim.

59:58.941 --> 01:00:01.076
If we leave Bob tied up down
there,

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.747
he's gonna pin it on us in a
heartbeat.

01:00:03.779 --> 01:00:04.681
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

01:00:04.714 --> 01:00:06.716
Use your fuckin' head for a
second.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.652
What do you think he's gonna do,
huh, huh?

01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:10.919
Think about it.

01:00:21.731 --> 01:00:24.900
Where's this Goddamn money
then, huh?

01:00:24.933 --> 01:00:28.871
Well, don't you think we
would've found it by now?

01:00:28.904 --> 01:00:30.172
What if it's not here?

01:00:30.205 --> 01:00:34.843
We shoulda found it by
now, but we know it's here.

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:36.211
It's here, okay?

01:00:39.281 --> 01:00:41.050
It can't not be here!

01:00:45.054 --> 01:00:46.388
Hey, look at me.

01:00:47.489 --> 01:00:49.291
We will find it, okay?

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.860
Okay?

01:00:51.894 --> 01:00:52.961
Okay, okay.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:27.296
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:01:29.998 --> 01:01:31.835
Nod if you understand.

01:01:36.538 --> 01:01:39.809
Your wife's dead, your
neighbor's dead,

01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:43.645
and you're missing a toe.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.180
So don't think for one moment

01:01:45.214 --> 01:01:48.150
that we won't put a bullet
in the back of your head

01:01:48.183 --> 01:01:50.953
and leave this all pinned on
you.

01:01:54.456 --> 01:01:57.359
We need to know where the money
is.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.836
You wanna say that again?

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.704
Water.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.581
Lean back.

01:02:32.862 --> 01:02:33.897
Money.

01:02:33.929 --> 01:02:35.899
I told you, there isn't any.

01:02:35.931 --> 01:02:37.466
It's all gone.

01:02:37.499 --> 01:02:38.333
All of it.

01:02:40.703 --> 01:02:43.639
I've been trying to tell you
that.

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:47.976
It all got sunk into
stocks, bonds, investments.

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.011
Every penny.

01:02:50.379 --> 01:02:52.047
I had no choice if I wanted to
hide it

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.684
from that money-grubbing bitch.

01:03:11.768 --> 01:03:15.037
Better not be fucking with us.

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:16.572
You piece of shit.

01:03:23.813 --> 01:03:24.714
Fuck.

01:03:24.747 --> 01:03:28.083
I told you, man, we just need
to leave.

01:03:44.801 --> 01:03:45.634
Fuck!

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:48.136
Hey, you need to shut the fuck
up.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:50.272
We are too far into this!

01:03:53.475 --> 01:03:54.944
What the fuck was that?

01:03:54.978 --> 01:03:56.578
Hey, what was that?

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:00.950
Hey!

01:04:00.984 --> 01:04:03.585
You cocksucker, you, help me.

01:04:06.522 --> 01:04:09.692
Fuck, fuck.

01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.964
Oh, shit.

01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:18.166
What was that?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.802
Where the hell did you
think you were going?

01:04:19.836 --> 01:04:21.036
Just stretching my legs.

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.404
I'm gonna shoot this piece o'
shit.

01:04:22.437 --> 01:04:23.505
Wait, wait.

01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:27.543
I can't do this.

01:04:29.044 --> 01:04:30.178
Hey, kid...

01:04:30.212 --> 01:04:31.014
I can't watch this.

01:04:31.046 --> 01:04:32.247
Get me outta this.

01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:34.751
Take me to the hospital, and
I'll split the money with you.

01:04:38.654 --> 01:04:41.523
Goddamn!

01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:43.425
I knew there was money, you
cocksucker!

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:44.359
Fuck you!

01:04:46.061 --> 01:04:48.263
Kid, there's $100,000.

01:04:48.297 --> 01:04:49.164
It's all yours.

01:04:49.197 --> 01:04:49.999
This isn't right.

01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:50.934
Hey, listen to me.

01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:52.969
You go in the fuckin' kitchen
right now.

01:04:53.002 --> 01:04:54.871
Get in the other Goddamn room.

01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:55.838
Fuckin' go!

01:04:59.174 --> 01:05:00.075
Look at me.

01:05:01.243 --> 01:05:02.779
I'm gonna put a fucking
bullet in your Goddamn kneecap

01:05:02.812 --> 01:05:04.379
if you don't tell me where
the fucking money is.

01:05:18.695 --> 01:05:20.562
Son of the bitch!

01:05:20.596 --> 01:05:21.463
Try the other kneecap?

01:05:21.496 --> 01:05:22.699
Fuck you!

01:05:22.732 --> 01:05:24.566
Goddamn, I'm gonna
shoot this piece of shit!

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.268
Wait, don't shoot!

01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:29.072
You see a phone book around here
anywhere?

01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:30.039
Phone book!

01:05:31.173 --> 01:05:33.977
Fuck you want a Goddamn phone
book for?

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:42.184
Piece o' shit.

01:05:46.723 --> 01:05:48.190
I can't go back to prison,
man.

01:05:48.223 --> 01:05:49.826
You're not going back to
prison, kid.

01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:51.460
See a phone book around here
anywhere?

01:05:54.697 --> 01:05:55.765
Over there.

01:06:00.435 --> 01:06:01.370
Found it!

01:06:04.073 --> 01:06:05.108
No, no.

01:06:09.277 --> 01:06:11.014
Now do you rememeber?

01:06:13.649 --> 01:06:15.918
There's no fuckin' money.

01:06:19.554 --> 01:06:20.355
Hey!

01:06:20.389 --> 01:06:21.356
Hey!

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.792
We need to get the fuck out of
here.

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:24.093
It's 3:00 a.m..

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:27.997
What was that?

01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:30.066
You are gonna go to the
bedroom, find a suitcase,

01:06:30.099 --> 01:06:32.101
and throw everything worth
anything in,

01:06:32.135 --> 01:06:34.469
any jewelry, no electronics!

01:06:35.404 --> 01:06:36.204
Come on, man.

01:06:36.238 --> 01:06:37.040
Why can't we just leave?

01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:37.874
- It's over!
- Because

01:06:37.907 --> 01:06:38.941
that's what I said we're gonna
do.

01:06:38.975 --> 01:06:41.276
No money, we're gonna get
something out of this.

01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:42.145
Now go!

01:07:40.703 --> 01:07:41.636
Now what?

01:07:43.572 --> 01:07:45.474
I'm starting to believe old
Bob here.

01:07:45.507 --> 01:07:47.877
Either it's not here, or
he doesn't give a shit,

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:49.511
he just wants us to kill him.

01:07:49.544 --> 01:07:51.180
No, no, no, listen to me.

01:07:51.214 --> 01:07:52.982
I know that it's here, okay?

01:07:53.015 --> 01:07:54.717
It can't not be here!

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:57.285
It might be, but we're
running into daylight,

01:07:57.319 --> 01:07:58.855
and we have two dead bodies in
the trunk

01:07:58.888 --> 01:08:01.256
of that car out there.

01:08:01.289 --> 01:08:02.424
So you're saying we give up?

01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:04.526
I'm saying, we need to
figure out what to do with him

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:07.063
and get rid of that car!

01:08:07.096 --> 01:08:09.132
You're saying we fucking give
up?

01:08:09.165 --> 01:08:12.334
listen to me, okay?

01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:14.704
We have to figure this out!

01:08:14.737 --> 01:08:16.706
No, we have to figure
out how to get out of here

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:19.341
and not wind up in prison the
rest of our fuckin' lives.

01:08:19.374 --> 01:08:20.375
Goddamnit!

01:09:17.566 --> 01:09:20.468
I'm gonna, I'm gonna tape up
Bob,

01:09:22.504 --> 01:09:25.107
and why don't you go check on
Tim?

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.209
I'm worried about him.

01:09:26.242 --> 01:09:27.143
He's crackin'!

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:28.176
He's fine.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.848
Kid's tougher than he looks.

01:09:44.126 --> 01:09:45.294
How you doin'?

01:09:48.462 --> 01:09:49.966
Are you all right?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.135
Do I look all right?

01:09:53.169 --> 01:09:55.171
I didn't sign up for this!

01:09:55.204 --> 01:09:56.638
None of us did.

01:09:58.673 --> 01:10:01.010
But we all knew it could go
wrong.

01:10:01.043 --> 01:10:03.746
There's always that chance.

01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:04.814
Not this!

01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:05.781
Not murder.

01:10:07.216 --> 01:10:09.218
Do you even have a plan?

01:10:10.219 --> 01:10:14.290
Or are we just gonna keep
stacking bodies in the trunk?

01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:16.259
Who's next, me?

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:17.126
Jeff?

01:10:18.027 --> 01:10:19.028
Calm down.

01:10:23.398 --> 01:10:25.735
You can fuckin' calm down.

01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:29.705
Just hurry up.

01:10:30.706 --> 01:10:32.975
We have to get outta here.

01:10:49.692 --> 01:10:50.960
We need to figure this out.

01:10:50.993 --> 01:10:52.295
Tim needs to get outta this,

01:10:52.328 --> 01:10:54.629
and frankly, I'm a
little worried about him.

01:10:54.663 --> 01:10:55.497
Oh yeah?

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.564
Yeah.

01:10:56.598 --> 01:10:58.034
You're more worried than
you were 5 minutes ago?

01:10:58.067 --> 01:11:01.569
Worried that he's not gonna
be able to take it and talk.

01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:02.437
Or worse.

01:11:04.106 --> 01:11:04.974
Look at his face.

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:07.009
Next time we see him, he is
losing it.

01:11:07.043 --> 01:11:11.280
Remember, Jeff, he's your
fuckin' friend, not mine.

01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:14.951
Don't worry about Tim, okay?

01:11:17.219 --> 01:11:21.424
He just needs to get out of
this fucking house, okay?

01:11:21.456 --> 01:11:22.291
We all do.

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:29.031
Yo, I got what I could find.

01:11:29.065 --> 01:11:32.168
It's probably like $1,000 worth.

01:11:32.201 --> 01:11:33.035
Good.

01:11:36.272 --> 01:11:37.106
What about him?

01:11:37.139 --> 01:11:40.142
Oh, we're going for a little
ride.

01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:45.381
Wanna go for a little ride,
there, Bob?

01:11:54.256 --> 01:11:55.424
That'll be nine bucks.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:56.292
Jesus.

01:11:57.559 --> 01:11:59.295
I thought he opened a tab.

01:11:59.328 --> 01:12:03.099
Well, he does have
one, but, uh, you don't.

01:12:29.759 --> 01:12:31.093
I need change.

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:08.663
The safe.

01:13:10.232 --> 01:13:12.835
How do you plan on dealing with
that?

01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:14.136
I got that covered.

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:15.337
No way, man.

01:13:15.371 --> 01:13:19.975
I'm not walking into a situation
without knowing for sure.

01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:20.810
All right.

01:13:21.911 --> 01:13:23.145
Look, I know somebody who's
helping me out

01:13:23.179 --> 01:13:23.979
with the combo, all right?

01:13:24.013 --> 01:13:26.949
Somebody who's close to him.

01:13:26.982 --> 01:13:29.485
Like I said, easy, in and out.

01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:33.989
What if someone's there?

01:13:34.023 --> 01:13:37.093
How do you plan on dealing with
that?

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:42.064
Fucking deal with it.

01:13:42.098 --> 01:13:42.898
Look...

01:13:42.932 --> 01:13:43.732
Bartender!

01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:44.567
Hey.

01:13:44.599 --> 01:13:45.901
What?

01:13:45.935 --> 01:13:48.237
Nobody gets hurt if we
do it quick, all right?

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.239
The guy lives in the middle of
nowhere,

01:13:50.272 --> 01:13:53.075
off a dirt road for Christ sake.

01:13:53.109 --> 01:13:53.909
Bartender.

01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:55.377
A few more shots.

01:14:05.588 --> 01:14:06.422
Oh.

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:15.731
No one gets hurt?

01:14:15.764 --> 01:14:16.899
Fuck no, man.

01:14:16.932 --> 01:14:20.369
I don't wanna go the fuck back
to prison.

01:14:21.604 --> 01:14:22.438
And Tim?

01:14:27.276 --> 01:14:29.111
We'll have him drive.

01:14:29.145 --> 01:14:30.079
In and out.

01:14:40.823 --> 01:14:43.526
No way I'm gonna let
Tracy sink me like this.

01:14:43.559 --> 01:14:47.229
I'm not sure you have a
whole lotta choice here.

01:14:47.263 --> 01:14:50.166
She has video of you with the
girl.

01:14:56.505 --> 01:14:58.507
What's my best option?

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:00.676
Honestly?

01:15:02.745 --> 01:15:06.582
You didn't have her sign a
prenup like I told you to do.

01:15:06.615 --> 01:15:09.285
If you take it to court, you'll
lose.

01:15:09.318 --> 01:15:10.319
Just settle.

01:15:11.187 --> 01:15:12.154
Let her have what she wants.

01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:14.823
If you settle, she won't take
the company.

01:15:14.857 --> 01:15:19.295
Fuck, may be a good thing
if she takes the company.

01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:25.167
You still have the rainy day
fund?

01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:28.304
Yeah, 'bout a half million in
cash.

01:15:30.873 --> 01:15:33.976
Something she can't get her
hands on.

01:15:34.009 --> 01:15:34.843
Good.

01:15:35.878 --> 01:15:37.046
Keep it handy.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.454
Fuck.

01:15:50.694 --> 01:15:53.095
Jeff has the keys.

01:15:53.128 --> 01:15:54.196
Go get 'em.

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:02.805
That's not gonna fit.

01:16:02.838 --> 01:16:04.039
Let's just put it in the back
seat.

01:16:04.073 --> 01:16:07.509
Go get the fucking keys from
Jeff, Tim.

01:16:13.315 --> 01:16:14.718
You all right?

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:15.584
Yeah.

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:17.786
Hey, you all right, or what?

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:18.821
I'm good.

01:16:18.854 --> 01:16:20.422
Yeah, no, I'm good.

01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:23.225
Good.

01:17:02.766 --> 01:17:04.333
Hey, go in there and help Jeff
clean up.

01:17:04.366 --> 01:17:06.568
We gotta get outta here.

01:17:17.813 --> 01:17:18.647
Oh fuck.

01:17:49.779 --> 01:17:52.614
All right, all right, all
right.

01:17:56.952 --> 01:17:57.953
Jesus.

01:17:57.986 --> 01:17:58.822
Fuck.

01:18:08.497 --> 01:18:10.099
Fuck!

01:18:10.132 --> 01:18:10.966
Hang on.

01:18:13.135 --> 01:18:14.136
All right.

01:18:29.017 --> 01:18:29.853
Fuck!

01:18:31.788 --> 01:18:32.621
Okay, fuck him.

01:18:35.357 --> 01:18:37.694
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:41.897
Turn the Goddamn....

01:18:47.236 --> 01:18:48.303
All right.

01:18:48.337 --> 01:18:50.005
You ready to do this?

01:18:50.038 --> 01:18:51.940
Let's do it.

01:18:51.974 --> 01:18:53.208
There you go.

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:55.745
Come on.

01:18:56.813 --> 01:18:57.613
Come on.

01:18:57.646 --> 01:18:58.447
Come on.

01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:03.285
Now shut the fuck up, Bob.

01:19:04.486 --> 01:19:05.287
Damnit

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.155
Fuck.

01:19:07.256 --> 01:19:08.056
Damn it.

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.957
Jesus!

01:19:11.694 --> 01:19:13.595
Get this out of my way.

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:15.698
Fuck!

01:19:15.732 --> 01:19:17.734
Watch your fucking head.

01:20:32.574 --> 01:20:33.910
What the fuck?

01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:43.285
Ah, fuck.

01:20:57.332 --> 01:20:58.166
Bunny?

01:20:59.969 --> 01:21:03.272
How long did you think I would
wait?

01:21:03.305 --> 01:21:05.040
I'm guessing a while.

01:21:06.341 --> 01:21:10.512
Look, I was
planning to come and see you.

01:21:10.546 --> 01:21:12.815
Mm hm, I'm sure you were.

01:21:16.451 --> 01:21:20.957
I was gonna give you some
time after you got out.

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:24.192
After all, you did do three
years for me.

01:21:24.226 --> 01:21:29.231
Yeah, um,
what the fuck is this, hm?

01:21:32.702 --> 01:21:35.872
I mean, I thought my Goddamn
debt would be paid by now.

01:21:35.905 --> 01:21:36.873
Mm.

01:21:36.906 --> 01:21:40.677
I mean, I did do three
fucking years for you.

01:21:57.326 --> 01:22:01.196
Honey, you're good,
but don't kid yourself.

01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:04.566
The only debt you paid was the
interest.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.035
You still owe me.

01:22:16.411 --> 01:22:18.246
We have history.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.817
But don't think for a
second I'm just gonna

01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:23.585
write off your entire debt to
me.

01:22:23.619 --> 01:22:26.055
What good would you be to me
then?

01:22:27.857 --> 01:22:29.092
Okay, listen.

01:22:34.764 --> 01:22:35.932
Look, you know that I can't get

01:22:35.965 --> 01:22:38.101
that kinda cash very quickly.

01:22:40.937 --> 01:22:43.372
You're resourceful.

01:22:43.405 --> 01:22:45.574
You'll think o' something.

01:22:48.443 --> 01:22:49.277
Untie him.

01:23:20.475 --> 01:23:23.079
What the fuck are we doing out
here?

01:23:23.112 --> 01:23:27.649
We gotta figure out something
to do with fuckin' Bob.

01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:28.751
I've already killed one person
tonight.

01:23:28.785 --> 01:23:30.820
Now you want me to kill another
one?

01:23:30.853 --> 01:23:33.923
Goddamnit, would you
just calm down and drive?

01:23:33.956 --> 01:23:35.758
I am fucking calm.

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:37.160
Does it not look like I'm calm?

01:23:37.192 --> 01:23:39.729
No, it doesn't look
like you're fuckin' calm.

01:23:39.762 --> 01:23:41.064
We've got two bodies in the
trunk

01:23:41.097 --> 01:23:42.832
and a taped-up dude in the
backseat.

01:23:42.865 --> 01:23:46.368
I'm about as fuckin' calm as I'm
gonna be.

01:23:54.476 --> 01:23:56.478
Shut the fuck up, Bob.

01:24:01.316 --> 01:24:02.617
Get him off!

01:24:02.651 --> 01:24:03.518
Get him off!

01:24:03.552 --> 01:24:04.519
I'm fucking trying!

01:24:04.553 --> 01:24:05.353
Fuck!

01:24:05.387 --> 01:24:06.189
Get him off!

01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:07.023
Bob!

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:08.691
Bob!

01:24:10.292 --> 01:24:11.626
What the hell?

01:24:30.079 --> 01:24:30.913
Move.

01:24:31.914 --> 01:24:33.015
Someone move!

01:24:49.264 --> 01:24:50.099
Hey!

01:24:54.237 --> 01:24:55.071
Dammit!

01:24:56.906 --> 01:24:58.406
Hey, go after him!

01:24:59.742 --> 01:25:02.044
I've got a fucking shotgun in my
trunk,

01:25:02.078 --> 01:25:03.246
a fucking shotgun in my trunk.

01:25:03.278 --> 01:25:04.379
Go after him.

01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:38.580
Fuck!

01:25:51.127 --> 01:25:51.928
Come on!

01:25:56.331 --> 01:25:57.767
Come on, come on!

01:25:59.735 --> 01:26:03.272
Why the fuck didn't you go after
him?

01:26:03.306 --> 01:26:04.406
Goddamnit.

01:26:04.439 --> 01:26:07.009
'Cause we're doing it together.

01:26:08.778 --> 01:26:09.611
Come on.

01:26:11.113 --> 01:26:11.948
Fuck.

01:27:30.693 --> 01:27:31.493
I got him!

01:27:31.526 --> 01:27:32.328
Fuckin' I got him!

01:27:32.361 --> 01:27:33.162
Yeah, don't shoot!

01:27:34.397 --> 01:27:35.497
Get the fuck down.

01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:36.799
You piece of shit.

01:27:36.832 --> 01:27:38.000
Get up on your fucking feet.

01:27:38.034 --> 01:27:38.834
Come on.

01:27:38.868 --> 01:27:39.668
Fuck you!

01:27:39.702 --> 01:27:41.170
Get the fuck, you piece o'
shit.

01:27:41.203 --> 01:27:42.004
Goddamnit.

01:27:42.038 --> 01:27:42.939
Fuck you!

01:27:49.845 --> 01:27:50.913
Come on, you piece o' shit.

01:27:50.947 --> 01:27:52.081
What the fuck are you doing?

01:27:52.114 --> 01:27:53.182
Come help us!

01:27:53.215 --> 01:27:54.750
Get the fuck up, man.

01:27:56.618 --> 01:27:57.452
I know.

01:28:00.022 --> 01:28:00.823
What?

01:28:00.856 --> 01:28:02.490
You know what?

01:28:04.961 --> 01:28:06.628
Why did you do it?

01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:10.800
Hey, we all needed the money,
okay?

01:28:12.134 --> 01:28:13.668
But you saw, there wasn't any,
all right?

01:28:13.703 --> 01:28:14.870
So right now, we just gotta take
care

01:28:14.904 --> 01:28:18.407
of this piece o' shit and
get the fuck outta here.

01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:20.109
I was in your car.

01:28:22.144 --> 01:28:24.080
I saw the picture of you two.

01:28:24.113 --> 01:28:25.381
It was you?

01:28:25.414 --> 01:28:27.950
Shut the fuck up, Bob.

01:28:27.984 --> 01:28:30.319
Tim, listen to me, listen.

01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:34.323
You stay right there.

01:28:36.491 --> 01:28:38.995
You were like a brother to me!

01:28:39.929 --> 01:28:40.763
Why?

01:28:42.898 --> 01:28:45.735
Why'd you have to put us through
this?

01:28:45.768 --> 01:28:48.838
Hey, look, I didn't care about
her.

01:28:49.739 --> 01:28:51.207
Then why?

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.744
She was gonna
fucking kill me, all right?

01:28:54.777 --> 01:28:55.678
Who, her?

01:28:56.812 --> 01:29:00.483
No, not that fuckin'
bitch, fuckin' Bunny!

01:29:02.118 --> 01:29:02.918
Bunny?

01:29:02.952 --> 01:29:03.753
Yeah.

01:29:03.786 --> 01:29:06.222
Man, what the fuck?

01:29:06.255 --> 01:29:07.890
Didn't you learn nothing?

01:29:07.923 --> 01:29:08.991
Hey, Tim...

01:29:11.027 --> 01:29:12.361
Look at me, huh?

01:29:13.929 --> 01:29:16.832
Let's just put our guns away,
okay?

01:29:18.267 --> 01:29:19.335
You made...

01:29:21.337 --> 01:29:23.239
You made me fuckin' kill her.

01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.106
For what?

01:29:25.107 --> 01:29:27.076
Some petty bullshit you got
yourself into

01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:28.911
with that gangster bitch?

01:29:28.944 --> 01:29:30.279
Come on, man!

01:29:30.312 --> 01:29:33.015
I didn't make you do anything!

01:29:33.049 --> 01:29:36.519
Christ, I didn't want her
fuckin' dead!

01:29:36.551 --> 01:29:38.320
You were the one that was
supposed to be watching her,

01:29:38.354 --> 01:29:40.256
right, not fucking me, all
right,

01:29:40.289 --> 01:29:41.424
so blame that shit on me.

01:29:41.457 --> 01:29:42.258
Don't...

01:29:50.565 --> 01:29:51.367
No.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.234
No, no.

01:30:16.725 --> 01:30:17.560
Fuck!

01:30:20.429 --> 01:30:21.464
Get the fuck off me.

01:30:21.497 --> 01:30:22.998
He was never gonna let it go.

01:30:23.032 --> 01:30:24.300
What the fuck?

01:30:24.333 --> 01:30:26.702
How the fuck do you know that?

01:31:04.106 --> 01:31:06.108
The sun's coming up.

01:31:10.946 --> 01:31:11.780
Fuck!

01:31:13.648 --> 01:31:14.483
Fuck.

01:31:16.085 --> 01:31:19.288
Piece o' shit up.

01:31:19.321 --> 01:31:23.592
Hey, we gotta get his.
