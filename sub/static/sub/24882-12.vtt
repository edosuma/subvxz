01:21.367 --> 01:24.667
- ♪ Bop, bop, bop, yeah. ♪
- Oh. Oh, hi. I'm Gabrielle.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.867
- Welcome
to "Sesame Street."
- Hello.

01:26.867 --> 01:29.967
Prairie Dawn and I
just came up with
a brand-new dance.

01:29.967 --> 01:32.300
- Yep. It's great.
We'll show you.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.300
First,
we bop, bop, bop.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.300
- ♪ Bop, bop, bopping... ♪
- Bop, bop. We're bopping.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.166
We bop.
And then we shake,
shake, shake.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.800
Shake, shake.
We're shaking it up.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.767
Yeah. Oh, and then
we twirl like this.

01:44.767 --> 01:46.967
Both:
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.934
It's so fancy, yes!

01:48.934 --> 01:51.567
And then we wave
our hands in the air

01:51.567 --> 01:54.233
like we just
do not care.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.367
I'm waving
and I do not care.

01:56.367 --> 02:00.433
- Don't care. Don't care.
- Oh, my. How invigorating.

02:00.433 --> 02:06.433
Oh, I just looo-ove
o dance.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.433
Mm-hmm.
I concur.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.500
Hey, let's make up
some more moves.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.066
Oh, oh, I know.
I know.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.400
We can whip
our hair everywhere
like this.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.133
- ♪ Whip, whip,
whippity whip... ♪
- Oh, yeah, that's good.

02:18.133 --> 02:20.633
- ♪ A whip, whip, whip,
and whip, whip, whip... ♪
- Hey.

02:20.633 --> 02:23.100
- ♪ A whippity whip,
a whip, whip, a whip... ♪
- Hey, hair.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.400
- Hair, you're not whipping.
- ♪ Whip, whip, whippity
whip... ♪

02:25.400 --> 02:28.266
Hair!
Oh, come on.

02:28.266 --> 02:31.734
Prairie, my hair
just doesn't whip everywhere

02:31.734 --> 02:32.934
the way yours does.

02:32.934 --> 02:36.467
Oh, you are right.
Uh, it does not.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.467
Hmm.
Oh, I have an idea.

02:39.467 --> 02:43.166
Instead of whipping our hair,
I can do my hair like yours,

02:43.166 --> 02:45.600
and we can both
wiggle our poofs.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.567
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.734
- Hey, let's go
ask Nina for help.
- Yes.

02:49.734 --> 02:50.767
- Nina!
- Nina!

02:50.767 --> 02:52.066
Do you do poofs?

02:53.333 --> 02:55.066
How's it going there,
Nina?

02:55.066 --> 02:57.667
- Well... hang on.
Hang on. Okay.
- Oh, ow! Ow! Ow!

02:57.667 --> 03:01.900
- Oh, ow! Oh!
- I'm sorry, Prairie Dawn.
I just--

03:01.900 --> 03:04.400
I can't get your hair to stay
in poofs like Gabrielle's.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.400
Oh, oh, dear.
Now what are we going to do?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.467
I don't know.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.767
My hair doesn't whip,

03:10.767 --> 03:13.867
and Prairie Dawn's
doesn't stay in poofs.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.700
How are we gonna dance
together?

03:15.700 --> 03:17.166
Oh, hang on.
Hang on.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.600
Who says you can't
dance together

03:18.600 --> 03:20.066
because you have
different kinds of hair?

03:20.066 --> 03:22.133
Well...

03:22.133 --> 03:23.500
- We say.
- Yeah.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.567
Our hair does
different things
when we dance.

03:25.567 --> 03:26.567
Oh, watch.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.533
I love it.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.867
Mm-hmm.

03:31.867 --> 03:34.500
Well, I guess
it might be kind of cool

03:34.500 --> 03:37.300
if we just let our hair
do what it wants to do.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.000
Oh, that is a great idea,
Gabrielle.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.767
I'll whip my hair
everywhere.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.400
And I'll wiggle
my poofs.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.633
Oh, boy, now our dance
is even better.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.100
Yeah.
Let's go practice.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.734
- Okay, okay. Thank you.
- Oh, thanks, Nina.

03:50.734 --> 03:52.767
Bye. De nada.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.934
- ♪ Bopping, shaking ♪
- ♪ Bop, bop, bop, and shake,

03:55.934 --> 03:58.700

03:58.700 --> 04:00.633
Yeah. Me, too.

Hi, Gabrielle.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.100

- Hi, Elmo.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.066
- Boy, that dance is so cool.
- Aww, thanks.

04:07.066 --> 04:09.633
- Oh, can Elmo
dance with you?
- Of course.

04:09.633 --> 04:14.433
- We'll teach you our dance,
and you can do it with us.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.967
We bop and we shake
and we twirl

04:16.967 --> 04:19.467
and we wave
our hands in the air
like we just do not care,

04:19.467 --> 04:22.600
and we are letting our hair
do whatever it wants to do.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.600
I am whipping mine
everywhere like this.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.700
Elmo:
Oh, ho ho ho!
Ha ha! Hee hee!

04:29.700 --> 04:32.667
And I'm wiggling
my poofs like this.

04:32.667 --> 04:37.066
Wow. Oh, that's so cool.
Wait a minute.

04:37.066 --> 04:40.934
How's Elmo gonna dance
if-- if Elmo doesn't
have any hair?

04:40.934 --> 04:42.800
- Hmm.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.600
Wait a minute.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.900

Elmo really wanted
to dance.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.633
Oh, hey, well,
you know what, Elmo?

05:29.633 --> 05:32.233
You know,
you might not have hair
on the top of your head,

05:32.233 --> 05:33.433
but, uh--

05:33.433 --> 05:36.867
But you've got
fur all over.

05:36.867 --> 05:39.033
Ha ha ha, yeah.

05:39.033 --> 05:42.867
Oh, Elmo can just
fluff his fur.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Excellent idea, Elmo.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.433
You just let your fur
do what it wants to do.

05:47.433 --> 05:49.767
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Now let's
teach you the moves.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.166
Okay, first,
you bop, bop, bop,

05:51.166 --> 05:52.834
and then you shake,
shake, shake, so--

05:52.834 --> 05:57.100
- Okay.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.867
Oh, well, Prairie Dawn
and Gabrielle

06:04.867 --> 06:07.333
are teaching Elmo
a new dance.

06:07.333 --> 06:11.000
Oh. Do you think
you could teach that dance
to me, too?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.467
- Of course we can.
- Yeah.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.800
Now, there's a lot
of bopping and shaking.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.233
Oh, great.

06:16.233 --> 06:19.433
And we all get to do
something different
with our hair.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.033
Oh, and fur.

06:21.033 --> 06:24.700
Oh, well,
I don't have fur

06:24.700 --> 06:26.400
and I don't have hair.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
Does that mean
I can't dance with you?

06:28.400 --> 06:31.066
All I've got
are these feathers.

06:31.066 --> 06:33.734
But, Big Bird,
feathers are fabulous!

06:33.734 --> 06:35.467
Of course you can
dance with us.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.967
Yeah. You just have
to let your feathers

06:37.967 --> 06:39.367
do what they want to do.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.500
- That's right.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.834
I call it shaking
my tail feathers.

06:43.834 --> 06:47.367
Oh! That is glorious,
Big Bird, very impressive.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.033
Okay, here we go.
Let's do the dance.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.300
Now first,
you bop, bop, bop,

06:50.300 --> 06:51.367
and then you
shake, shake, shake.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.467
- Yeah.
- So...

06:52.467 --> 06:54.166

07:03.800 --> 07:05.166

your hands in the air

07:07.433 --> 07:09.834
like you
just do not care.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.066
- I do not care.
- Elmo doesn't care.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.800

07:13.800 --> 07:17.333
And then you get to do
whatever you want
with your hair.

I'm Harjit, and because
of my family's religion,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.700
I've never cut my hair.

11:13.700 --> 11:17.033

But I'm getting better now,

11:51.133 --> 11:54.734

13:57.467 --> 14:00.500

Cookie monster,

14:07.333 --> 14:08.800

14:47.867 --> 14:49.800
Cookie Monster:
We're going to the pasta
factory.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.667
Cookie Monster:
Hello there, Mr. Factory Guy.

14:56.667 --> 15:00.166
Can you help us, please?
We need angel hair pasta.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.133
Hello, Cookie Monster
and Gonger.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.100
Welcome
to the pasta factory.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.834
I can tell you
all about how noodles

15:05.834 --> 15:07.667
like angel hair pasta
are made.

15:07.667 --> 15:10.834
Many types of pasta are made
from grains, like wheat.

15:10.834 --> 15:14.400
First, farmers grow the wheat,
and then they harvest it.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.100
Some of the wheat
is ground into flour.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.100
Then the flour
is mixed with water

15:19.100 --> 15:21.533
to make dough
for the pasta.

15:21.533 --> 15:24.900
In the factory, the dough
is made into big, flat sheets

15:24.900 --> 15:27.867
by putting it in between
two huge rollers.

15:27.867 --> 15:30.166
A special machine cuts
each piece of dough

15:30.166 --> 15:31.734
into very thin strips.

15:31.734 --> 15:33.000
Cookie Monster:
Oh, okay.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.600
Me get why it's called
angel hair pasta.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.166
Those noodles so thin
and stringy like hair.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.467
Factory Guy:
Exactly.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.533
Sometimes the pasta
hangs over those rods

15:40.533 --> 15:42.133
so it will dry straight.

15:42.133 --> 15:45.166
They're put in boxes or bags
and sent to the grocery store,

15:45.166 --> 15:46.700
where people buy them.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.533
Enjoy your angel hair pasta.
Good luck.

15:49.533 --> 15:50.567
Cookie Monster and Gonger:
Thank you!

15:51.734 --> 15:52.834
Cookie Monster:

15:54.667 --> 15:57.333
Okay, the water's boiling.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.467
Okay, good.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.800
Oh, and that's perfect,
Smartie,

21:23.800 --> 21:26.867
because Elmo wants to learn
all about hair today.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.767
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:29.767 --> 21:32.767
All:
We look it up.

21:32.767 --> 21:35.934
Getting the long

The shower head.

22:53.967 --> 22:55.467

Hi, Ms. Noodle.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.467
Ms. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering,

24:03.467 --> 24:06.033
how do you take care
of your hair?

24:09.300 --> 24:11.066
What is that,
a meatball sandwich?

24:11.066 --> 24:13.433
Kid:
That's for lunch,
not hair.

24:13.433 --> 24:16.500
Elmo:
No. You don't comb
your hair with that, silly.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.333
Doesn't Ms. Noodle
have a comb?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.967
You know, you put it
through your hair,

24:19.967 --> 24:22.600
and it has these things
that kind of look like teeth?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.500
Right, a comb.
Yeah.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.000
Kid #2:
That's not a comb.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.800
Kid #3:
A rake is for leaves.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.333
Elmo:
Yeah. Try again,
Ms. Noodle.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.500
Ha ha ha!

24:36.133 --> 24:39.600
Yeah! That's a comb!
Perfect.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.800
- Uh-oh.

Ms. Noodle's hair again.
