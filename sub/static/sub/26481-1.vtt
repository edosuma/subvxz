01:10.230 --> 01:13.770
YOU ARE ALIVE BECAUSE
THE GIRL REMAINS...

01:14.170 --> 01:15.500
USEFUL.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.870
I SEE YOU AGAIN...

01:20.870 --> 01:24.090
I'LL CUT OUT YOUR
INSIDES AND FEED THEM TO HER.

01:26.090 --> 01:28.180
WHILE YOU WATCH.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.400
NOT IF I KILL YOU FIRST.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.560
REALLY NATE?

01:51.560 --> 01:54.550
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN
YOUR FRIDGE BESIDES ALCOHOL.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.980
YOU SAY SOMETHING?

01:58.980 --> 02:01.070
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DRINK.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.200
THERE'S PLENTY OF BEER,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:07.900 --> 02:11.100
SHE DOESN'T WANT BEER, NATE.
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.000
OH, OKAY.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.480
LOOK, SEE THAT FREEZER DOOR?

02:17.880 --> 02:19.070
UH-HUH.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.200
OKAY, NOW DON'T OPEN IT.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.520
BUT THERE'S A LEVER RIGHT ON THE DOOR.
IF YOU PUSH THAT IN-

02:25.520 --> 02:29.250
THERE'S FILTERED WATER. IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.000
YOU'RE SUCH AN A-

02:33.000 --> 02:34.530
I'M SORRY AJ, IT'S MY FAULT.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.000
I PACKED UP EVERYTHING FOR THE
WEEKEND AND IT'S AT MY HOUSE.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.280
I'M SORRY.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.570
SO HE'S NOT BRINGING ANY BEER?

02:41.570 --> 02:44.910
OH, I AM. SHE PACKED THE REST UP ALREADY.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.650
WHAT YOU SEE IN THERE IS LEFTOVER.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.390
PETER BETTER BE REALLY, REALLY HOT.

02:56.390 --> 02:58.340
OTHERWISE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.150
HE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE
GUY SO YOU'D LIKE HIM.

03:02.150 --> 03:06.590
AND IF NOT THERE'S PLENTY OF
WOODS SO YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SPACE.

03:19.190 --> 03:20.840
OH, PIZZA.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.010
I'LL GET IT.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.500
NO I'VE GOT THE MONEY HERE.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.720
PLEASE, YOU'RE NOT PAYING.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.190
HI.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.430
UM. IT'LL BE $29.50.

03:44.530 --> 03:47.990
YOU WENT TO WALL HIGH SCHOOL
THE LAST TWO YEARS, RIGHT?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.200
YEAH.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.600
AMBER. RIGHT?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.720
NO ONE EVER CALLED ME AMBER.
IT WAS ALWAYS AJ.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.580
HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING THIS JOB?

04:07.180 --> 04:09.280
SINCE SENIOR YEAR.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.480
I STARTED IN THE KITCHEN.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.510
I JUST STARTED DELIVERING
AFTER SCHOOL ENDED.

04:14.110 --> 04:15.850
YOU'RE BRAVE.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.990
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE GOING TO STRANGE
PLACES ALONE THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.970
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.920
I BET YOU GOT TO TAKE
WHAT YOU CAN GET, RIGHT?

04:29.420 --> 04:30.610
YEAH.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.530
UM. I HAVE SOME MORE DELIVERIES, SO...

04:38.130 --> 04:40.500
OH, RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOU UP.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.910
HERE.

05:01.860 --> 05:06.050
SODA'S ON THE HOUSE. I
BROUGHT IT BY MISTAKE.

05:06.850 --> 05:09.000
YOU CAN COME BACK AND GET IT.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.800
WE DON'T WANT IT.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.440
IT WAS SOMEONE WE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.520
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.840
NANCY? I THOUGHT SHE
WORKED AT THE OTHER PLACE.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.490
HOMESCHOOL.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.250
NO FREAKIN' WAY. YOU'RE LYING!

05:40.250 --> 05:42.000
NO, IT WAS HER!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.830
HOMESCHOOL?

05:44.830 --> 05:47.410
SHE TRANSFERRED INTO OUR
HIGH SCHOOL THE LAST TWO YEARS.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.640
SHE WAS HOMESCHOOLED BEFORE THEN.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.810
SHE WAS A CHARACTER.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.060
JESUS FREAK. ALWAYS DRESSED MODESTLY.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.010
- NEVER CURSED.
- NEVER TALKED.

05:58.010 --> 06:01.390
I MEAN, SHE SHOULDER-CHECKED
BRITTANY AND JUST WALKED AWAY.

06:01.390 --> 06:03.840
AJ ALMOST BEAT HER UP OVER THAT.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.230
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

06:06.230 --> 06:08.990
YEAH, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING, BUT -

06:08.990 --> 06:12.620
SHE NEVER APOLOGIZED OR ANYTHING.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.700
SHE JUST MADE THAT STUPID,
AWKWARD LOOK SHE ALWAYS DID-

06:14.700 --> 06:17.280
- AND THEN TRIED TO WALK AWAY.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.040
YEAH, IF ANYONE WAS GOING TO SHOOT
UP THE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING...

06:20.040 --> 06:22.000
IT WOULD'VE BEEN HER.

06:22.690 --> 06:26.170
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

06:26.170 --> 06:30.170
I TOLD YOU, SO PETER'S UNCLE WORKS
FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

06:30.170 --> 06:33.280
AND THEY TALK AROUND THERE.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.810
I THINK HER NAME IS IYA, OR AYA...

06:36.810 --> 06:38.640
... I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.710
SHE MOVED HERE FROM PEN'S GROVE.

06:40.710 --> 06:44.530
HER DAD'S IN JAIL
FOR RAPE AND MURDER.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.370
BUT HE WASN'T REALLY AROUND, ANYWAY.

06:47.370 --> 06:51.840
AND HER MOM DIED A FEW
YEARS AGO IN A ROBBERY.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.710
SHE NOW LIVES WITH HER AUNT AND UNCLE.

06:53.710 --> 06:56.920
SO, IF SHE'S A LITTLE TOO
WEIRD FOR YOU GUYS...

06:56.920 --> 06:58.770
SHE HAD HER REASONS.

07:49.740 --> 07:52.110
HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT.

07:52.110 --> 07:54.590
THEY'RE HEAVIER THAN THEY LOOK.

07:54.590 --> 07:56.960
YOU LOOK, LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO PASS OUT.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.380
JESSICA LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT TO PASS OUT.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.900
THERE'S GOOD, AMBER.

08:24.700 --> 08:29.100
I'VE GOT TO TELL NATE.
SO FAR, IT'S NOT BAD.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.510
IT'S QUIET. RELAXING.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.049
YEAH, FOR YOU.

08:34.049 --> 08:37.120
WHEN YOU GO CAMPING YOU WORK
FIRST, THEN YOU GET TO ENJOY IT.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.539
OH, HE DID NOT DRAG ME OUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE JUST TO WORK.

08:41.539 --> 08:44.410
I'M ENJOYING MYSELF FROM START TO FINISH.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.890
WE'LL MAKE HER COOK LATER.
GET SOME USE OUT OF HER.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.090
WATCH IT, FOUR-FOOT.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.720
OH, HEY PETER.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.100
DIDN'T YOU GUYS SAY WE SHOULD BE
THE ONLY ONES OUT HERE FOR MILES?

08:58.100 --> 09:00.310
MOST LIKELY.

09:00.310 --> 09:03.510
I'M PRETTY SURE WE SAW SMOKE.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.660
YEAH, IT WAS COMING FROM
OVER IN THAT DIRECTION.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.560
AND NATE AND BRITTANY
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THAT WAY.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.080
COULD BE A HUNTER OR... OTHER
PEOPLE LIKE US TRYING TO GET AWAY.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.540
COULD BE.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.660
HOW ABOUT YOU BE A GOOD BOY AND FIND OUT?

09:19.060 --> 09:21.100
I COULD COME WITH YOU.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.300
WORKS FOR ME.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.630
UM, JESSICA?

09:30.630 --> 09:33.280
OH, I'M NOT PLAYING THIRD WHEEL. GO AHEAD.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.500
JUST, DON'T GO TOO FAR WITHOUT ME.

09:37.190 --> 09:39.000
WE'LL BE QUICK.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.000
CAN YOU GET BY OKAY?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.700
SURE CAN.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.400
AND WITHOUT LOOKING
RIDICULOUS IN A UNIFORM.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.440
HEY, THE LADY LIKES IT, THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS, ALL RIGHT?

10:01.440 --> 10:04.000
I'D WEAR IT ON OUR WEDDING
DAY IF SHE WANTED ME TO.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.040
WEDDING DAY? THAT'S AMBITIOUS.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.570
WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS A
FIGURE OF SPEECH BUT -

10:09.570 --> 10:11.550
A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD,
WHY WOULDN'T WE GET MARRIED?

10:11.550 --> 10:13.430
MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT FAR AHEAD.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.000
WELL, THEN THEY'RE SHORT SIGHTED.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.360
GOOD POINT.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.660
HOW MUCH FURTHER DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD GO -

10:20.660 --> 10:23.140
BEFORE WE TRY ANOTHER DIRECTION?

10:23.140 --> 10:25.270
WHY, ARE YOU GETTING
TIRED ON ME, GIRL SCOUT?

10:25.270 --> 10:29.410
NO, BUT... SUN'S GOING DOWN SOON.

10:29.410 --> 10:33.320
AND IF WE'RE NOT BACK BY DARK
YOUR LADY MIGHT FREAK OUT.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.060
WHY, BECAUSE I'M IN THE WOODS
WITH HER PRETTY BEST FRIEND?

10:37.060 --> 10:41.580
THAT IS THE LEAST OF HER CONCERNS.
SHE WON'T LAST A NIGHT OUT HERE IF-

10:53.280 --> 10:55.060
HUH.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.200
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE
ELSE WAS OUT THIS FAR.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.980
YEAH...

10:58.980 --> 11:02.170
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THEIR SPACE.

11:02.170 --> 11:06.510
YOU KNOW, CUT AROUND - GO FOR
ANOTHER MILE OR SO, MAYBE?

11:06.510 --> 11:08.500
NO, WE SHOULD...

11:08.500 --> 11:11.590
CHECK IT OUT. JUST TO BE SURE.

11:11.590 --> 11:14.260
YOU'RE NOT ON THE JOB, NATE.

11:14.260 --> 11:17.180
NO, BUT I'M A DECENT HUMAN BEING.
UNLIKE YOU, BRITTANY.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.680
HELLO? ANYONE THERE?

11:36.680 --> 11:38.860
I'M JUST DOING A WELFARE
CHECK, I'M A PARK RANGER.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.270
OH, MISTER BIG SHOT, HUH?

11:41.270 --> 11:43.350
DO YOU WANT THEM TO COME OUT SHOOTING?

11:43.350 --> 11:45.460
NO, I DO NOT.

11:59.060 --> 12:03.080
HEY, DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
MIGHT'VE HAPPENED?

12:03.080 --> 12:06.110
SOMEONE GETTING DRUNK THIS
FAR OUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.530
GOT EMPTY CASES OVER THERE.

12:08.530 --> 12:10.340
PROBABLY A HUNTER, SO THEY'RE ARMED.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.730
ANYONE THERE?

12:22.130 --> 12:23.400
HUH.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.490
REALLY?

12:34.490 --> 12:37.560
HEY, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
IT MIGHT BE ON HERE.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.730
YEAH, OR -

12:38.730 --> 12:41.230
A VIDEO OF THIS GUY'S LAST
SEXCAPADE STARRING HIMSELF AND -

12:41.230 --> 12:44.220
THE FABULOUS FIVE. >>
OH, YOU ARE SO DISGUSTING.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.950
PRIMARILY IT'S BECAUSE
YOUR BROTHER'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:51.950 --> 12:54.060
HE HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:54.060 --> 12:57.060
I'M BETTER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

12:57.060 --> 13:01.560
WELL, HE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR ASSOCIATIONS.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.040
HE'S MENTIONED
HIS CONCERNS DETECTIVE, BUT-

13:05.040 --> 13:07.540
WE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.560
THEN, WHY WON'T YOU
GO INTO DETAILS ABOUT IT?

13:10.560 --> 13:13.120
BECAUSE IT'S A PERSONAL MATTER.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.440
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.700
RELIGION AND POLITICS, RIGHT?

13:19.700 --> 13:22.480
NOT EVEN TO
A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER?

13:22.480 --> 13:25.050
YOU AND CALEB HAVE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT HAVEN'T YOU?

13:25.050 --> 13:28.440
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
TODAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.050
I'M NOT GOING TO
PRY INTO SPECIFICS, BUT...

13:31.050 --> 13:33.520
THERE ARE THINGS I NEED TO KNOW.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.500
IN ADDITION TO YOUR
BROTHER A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.650
SCARED AND I THINK
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.650
WHAT YOU AND YOUR
FELLOW PARISHIONERS DO-

13:40.650 --> 13:43.000
WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL KILLS
IS ONE THING, BUT...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.680
THERE ARE A LOT
OF MISSING PETS AND...

13:44.680 --> 13:46.840
POTENTIAL CASES
OF BREAKING AND ENTERING.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.390
RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE
WEIRDOS IN THE WOODS...

13:50.390 --> 13:54.030
PRAYING TO THEIR GODS,
PERFORMING STRANGE RITUALS.

13:54.030 --> 13:57.430
NOT HURTING ANYBODY.
SO THEY MUST BE INVOLVED?

13:57.430 --> 13:59.960
SOUNDS A BIT LIKE
SALEM TO ME, DETECTIVE.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.830
WELL, I THINK PEOPLE ARE...

14:03.830 --> 14:07.000
RIGHTFULLY DISTURBED
BY WHAT YOU'VE ADMITTED ARE...

14:07.000 --> 14:09.080
ANIMAL SACRIFICES.

14:09.080 --> 14:13.000
WE EAT WHAT WE KILL. AND WE
AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

14:16.270 --> 14:19.550
WELL, HURAM, YOUR ALLEGED
LEADER WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON-

14:19.550 --> 14:21.550
- JUST A YEAR AGO. HE HAS A...

14:21.550 --> 14:23.640
- SKETCHY PAST.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.180
WE WERE ALL RELEASED
FROM PRISON, SO TO SPEAK.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.900
THAT'S WHAT HE DID FOR US.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.590
WHO'S HE?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.850
NOTHING IN THERE. WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET ON THE WAY, HUH?

14:37.850 --> 14:39.360
YEAH.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.490
HEY, DID YOU SEE THIS?

14:41.490 --> 14:45.000
THE WOMAN IN THIS TAPE WAS PART
OF THAT CULT FROM A WHILE BACK.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.880
AND THIS IS ACTUAL FOOTAGE.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.670
I MEAN, THEY COULD'VE RECORDED
IT FROM TV OR SOMETHING, BUT...

14:50.670 --> 14:52.650
YEAH, IT'S UH... INTERESTING.

14:54.650 --> 14:56.400
BUT, NOTHING WE SHOULD
TELL THE OTHERS ABOUT.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.880
I DON'T WANT JESS'
IMAGINATION RUNNING WILD.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.900
HUH. I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.670
ALRIGHT, LET'S KEEP GOING
TILL WE FIND A SIGNAL.

15:04.670 --> 15:08.380
OTHERWISE, SHE'S GOING TO THINK YOU TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF ME WHILE WE WERE OUT HERE.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.490
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SAY, IN YOUR DREAMS.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.050
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CAMPING BEFORE?

15:27.050 --> 15:29.380
NOT REALLY.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.660
WHAT'S THAT MEAN? >>

15:31.660 --> 15:35.860
MY PARENTS' IDEA OF CAMPING WAS TAKING
OUR RV OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE-

15:35.860 --> 15:38.620
BUT STAYING INSIDE ALL DAY WATCHING MOVIES.

15:38.620 --> 15:41.540
WE'D GO TO THE MOST
GORGEOUS LOCATIONS, BUT...

15:41.540 --> 15:44.370
WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE STAYED
HOME AND WATCHED NATURE VIDEOS.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.300
I'M NOT SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT SLEEPING OUTSIDE...

15:49.300 --> 15:51.410
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE DID.

15:52.810 --> 15:54.000
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.860
THE NIGHTS CAN BE A LITTLE ROUGH
AT FIRST BUT - IN THE MORNING...

15:58.860 --> 16:01.770
WELL, YOU'LL SEE. I PICKED
OUT THE SPOT MYSELF.

16:01.770 --> 16:05.020
YEAH, I HEARD. YOU SPENT THE NIGHT ALONE?

16:05.020 --> 16:06.800
I DID.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.500
I WANTED TO GET THE BEST VIEW OF
THE SUNRISE. THE MOON COMING UP.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.420
THE NIGHTS CAN BE FUN, BUT...

16:13.420 --> 16:15.640
WAKING UP IN NATURE AT FIVE IN THE MORNING.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.960
NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.530
I CAN'T WAIT.

16:20.130 --> 16:23.150
I HOPE YOUR FRIEND JESSICA
COMES AROUND TO IT.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.850
YEAH, SHE'S NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.410
MY PARENTS THINK I'M NOT
GOING TO LAST THE NIGHT-

16:28.410 --> 16:30.190
- BUT I'M GOING TO PROVE THEM WRONG.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.430
WHY DO THEY SAY THAT?

16:32.430 --> 16:35.280
THEY UNDERESTIMATE ME. THEY ALWAYS DO.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.260
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

16:37.260 --> 16:41.800
I'M JUST THE SPOILED RICH BRAT WHO
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE OF HERSELF.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.820
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE A SPOILED BRAT TO ME.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.780
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.330
WELL... YET.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.800
UH, I GUESS WE SHOULD START
LOOKING FOR THAT SMOKE.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.849
MANMADE FIRE.

17:23.849 --> 17:26.069
AND IT LOOKS WELL KEPT.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.890
BUT, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYONE'S SITE.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.300
SHOULD WE GO PUT IT OUT?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.390
MIGHT WANT TO WAIT FOR A FEW MINUTES FIRST.

17:43.390 --> 17:46.880
PUT OUT THE WRONG MAN'S FIRE
AND WE COULD GET INTO TROUBLE.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.200
BUT I DON'T... SEE...

17:58.800 --> 18:00.200
IS THAT A... A PERSON?

18:48.700 --> 18:50.430
IS HE LOOKING AT US?

19:28.140 --> 19:29.600
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

19:32.800 --> 19:36.010
DON'T KNOW. DON'T CARE.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.920
SHOULD WE GO CHECK IT OUT?

19:38.920 --> 19:42.710
I'M NOT ON THE CLOCK SO NO.
I SAY WE GET BACK TO CAMP.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.960
OKAY.

20:18.620 --> 20:19.910
JESS?

20:22.010 --> 20:25.780
OH SHOOT! THAT WAS NOT FUNNY!

20:25.780 --> 20:28.700
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU GUYS
A NICE SCARY MOVIE MOMENT.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.490
SEE, I BROUGHT YOU TWO CLOSER TOGETHER.

20:34.090 --> 20:34.380
NOT COOL!

20:37.000 --> 20:40.260
SO HOW'D IT GO OUT THERE? WAS IT A FIRE?

20:40.260 --> 20:43.490
SOME WEIRDO BURNING BAGS AND STUFF.

20:44.490 --> 20:47.690
PAPERS. IT LOOKED LIKE.

20:47.690 --> 20:52.640
REDNECK WAY OF SHREDDING
PERSONAL DOCUMENTS OR SOMETHING?

20:52.640 --> 20:54.130
WHY NOT LET 'EM BURN?

20:55.730 --> 20:57.890
OR IT COULD'VE BEEN EVIDENCE.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.500
SO, CAN YOU TELL ME HIS NAME?

21:18.500 --> 21:22.210
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.
THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE

21:22.210 --> 21:23.710
WHAT PURPOSE?

21:23.710 --> 21:27.600
HE'S A REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR GOD.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.690
WE'VE NEVER SEEN HIS FACE
BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE US-

21:29.690 --> 21:32.280
AN IMAGE TO WORSHIP.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.230
SO, HOW DID YOU MEET HIM?

21:34.230 --> 21:38.600
HE SENT LETTERS TO ME. AND TO THE OTHERS.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.420
HE TOLD US ABOUT HIMSELF. WHAT
HE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH AND-

21:42.420 --> 21:45.820
HE INVITED US TO BE A PART OF IT.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.940
HOW DID HE PICK YOU?

21:47.940 --> 21:51.230
IS THERE SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT YOU? OR...

21:51.230 --> 21:54.320
YES. BUT IT WASN'T OUR SARCASM.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.270
HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT US.

21:58.270 --> 22:01.870
WE ALL HAD SOME... KIND OF...

22:01.870 --> 22:06.450
TRAGEDY OR UNFORTUNATE
EVENTS IN OUR LIVES.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.740
HE OFFERED US HEALING.

22:08.740 --> 22:12.000
AND A WAY TO MAKE EVERYTHING
BETTER FOR EVERYONE EVENTUALLY.

22:13.850 --> 22:17.940
AND HE WASN'T JUST...
PREYING ON THE WEAK?

22:17.940 --> 22:20.990
THE ABUSES WE LIVED THROUGH
AND SURVIVED MAKES US WEAK?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.900
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO IMPLY THAT I'M SORRY.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.540
IT'S OKAY.

22:27.540 --> 22:33.260
WHAT DOES THE BLOOD
HAVE TO DO WITH THESE RITUALS?

22:33.260 --> 22:35.280
I KNOW IT'S
INVOLVED IN WHAT YOU DO.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.700
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
GETTING OUR ATTENTION.

22:37.700 --> 22:42.040
THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD.
BLOOD IS SACRED.

22:42.040 --> 22:46.560
IT'S THE SOURCE OF ALL
LIFE INCLUDING OUR GOD'S.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.980
WHY DOES A
SPIRITUAL BEING NEED BLOOD?

22:48.980 --> 22:51.220
SO HE CAN MOVE ACROSS THE PLANE.

22:51.220 --> 22:54.880
SO HE'S NOT LIMITED TO THE SPIRITUAL.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.240
THINK OF IT LIKE THE SECOND
COMING IN CHRISTIAN TERMS.

22:59.240 --> 23:04.140
OUR SACRIFICES. THE ANIMALS
WE ABSOLVE AND EAT.

23:04.140 --> 23:07.020
THE BLOOD WE POUR OUT.

23:07.020 --> 23:10.800
WE GIVE IT TO HIM.
TO GIVE HIM A BODY.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.480
EW.

23:41.480 --> 23:45.450
SORRY, MOM MADE ME COME
TO BED HALF AN HOUR AGO, BUT...

23:45.450 --> 23:46.940
I CAN'T SLEEP.

23:46.940 --> 23:49.120
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE READY TO ME.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.880
I AM TIRED.

23:52.670 --> 23:54.270
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.790
NOPE. SPIT IT OUT.

24:01.290 --> 24:03.970
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU ALL WEEK.

24:03.970 --> 24:08.150
WHAT? WE HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER YESTERDAY.

24:08.150 --> 24:11.500
YOU SHOVED WAFFLES DOWN YOUR
THROAT WHILE YOU PUT YOUR COAT ON.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.200
AND THEN YOU RAN OUT THE DOOR.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.180
DOESN'T COUNT.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.470
ALICE.

24:17.470 --> 24:21.900
I JUST MISS YOU. I KNOW YOU
HAVE WORK AND SCHOOL, BUT...

24:23.200 --> 24:25.140
THE SEMESTER'S OVER IN A WEEK.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.750
THEN I'LL BE AROUND.

24:26.750 --> 24:30.040
I'LL HAVE SCHOOL FOR
ANOTHER WEEK AFTER THAT.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.000
TRUE. BUT I WON'T BE SCARFING
DOWN WAFFLES IN THE MORNING -

24:33.000 --> 24:37.350
TRYING TO GET OUT ON TIME. WE'LL
HAVE REAL BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

24:37.350 --> 24:40.360
AND THEN...

24:40.360 --> 24:43.250
FINE. TWO WEEKS.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.370
THEN YOU'LL SEE A WHOLE LOT OF ME.

24:45.370 --> 24:47.780
ARE YOU GOING TO BE HOME SOON?

24:47.780 --> 24:51.700
YEAH, IF SOME JERK DOESN'T ORDER
PIZZA AT THE LAST MINUTE.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.700
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.670
IT HAPPENS. TRUST ME.

25:07.230 --> 25:08.870
WHERE IS IT?

25:08.870 --> 25:11.720
DOWN ATLANTIC AVENUE. TOWARD WALL.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.240
UH HUH.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.990
I TOLD THE GUY WE WERE
PRACTICALLY CLOSED, BUT...

25:17.990 --> 25:21.670
I'D ASK MY DRIVER AND SHE MIGHT
DO IT FOR A GENEROUS TIP.

25:23.470 --> 25:24.990
YOUR CALL.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.910
YOU BETTER SPEND THAT TIP
TAKING ME OUT IN TWO WEEKS.

25:32.910 --> 25:35.000
DEAL.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.190
JOEY DELIVERED THERE A FEW TIMES.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.760
I THINK IT'S A DISABLED VET.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.360
HOW DO YOU SAY NO TO THAT?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.900
I'LL DO IT.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.070
YOU'RE THE BEST.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.910
WHAT AILS THEE?

26:01.910 --> 26:04.180
NOTHING.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.780
TELL ME.

26:06.780 --> 26:10.690
WELL, DADDY KEEPS TELLING ME
HOW DANGEROUS YOUR JOB IS.

26:10.690 --> 26:14.280
AND I'VE HEARD STORIES
SO, SOMETIMES I WORRY.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.500
DON'T.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.730
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST WEIRDO I KNOW
AND I SLEEP UNDER A ROOF WITH YOU.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.310
SOUNDS LIKE DARKMAN.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.410
THAT OLD LIAM NEESON MOVIE?

26:39.110 --> 26:43.340
NO, ITS OUR NICKNAME FOR A HERMIT
SOME PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING OUT HERE.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.080
WELL, HE'S USUALLY COVERED
FROM HEAD TO TOE AND...

26:46.080 --> 26:49.220
THEY THINK HE MIGHT
BE A BURN VICTIM, BUT...

26:49.220 --> 26:51.420
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT HE LOOKS...

26:51.420 --> 26:54.210
JUST LIKE ONE OF THE
CULT MEMBERS WHO DIED.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.320
BACK FROM THE DEAD OR SOMETHING, SO...

26:56.320 --> 26:59.870
WHAT? YOU TOOK US OUT HERE AND
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT FIRST?

26:59.870 --> 27:01.180
AH, COME ON JESS.

27:01.180 --> 27:04.400
I MEAN, THERE'S ALL SORTS OF
PEOPLE OUT DEEP IN THE WOODS.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.320
OKAY? BUT THEY'RE HARMLESS. I
MEAN HE'S NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.800
WE WOULD KNOW. >>THAT'S COMFORTING

27:08.800 --> 27:11.150
WHAT IF HE IS A PART OF THAT CULT?

27:11.150 --> 27:14.920
AW, COME ON. THEY'RE ALL
EITHER DEAD OR INCARCERATED.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.250
AND BESIDES, THAT WAS NINE YEARS AGO.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.480
DIDN'T THEY MOSTLY KILL ANIMALS?

27:20.480 --> 27:23.510
YEAH, I SWEAR TO THIS DAY
THEY KILLED MY FIRST DOG.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.620
OH, NOT THIS AGAIN.

27:25.620 --> 27:29.640
I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND LET HENRY
INTO THE BACKYARD FOR HALF AN HOUR.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.180
BROUGHT HIM BACK IN, LAID DOWN FOR MY NAP.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.840
AND WHEN I WOKE UP THE BACK DOOR
WAS OPEN AND HENRY WAS GONE.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.760
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL - WHO
NAMES THEIR DOG HENRY?

27:40.650 --> 27:44.090
AND SECOND OF ALL, YOU JUST LEFT THE
DOOR OPEN WHEN YOU LET HIM BACK INSIDE.

27:44.090 --> 27:45.900
NO, I ALWAYS CLOSED IT.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.120
AND LOCKED IT BECAUSE I WAS HOME ALONE.

27:48.120 --> 27:52.520
MY PARENTS ASSUMED I LEFT IT OPEN
THAT DAY BUT I DON'T THINK I DID.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.590
I DON'T THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE
IT HAPPENED AROUND THAT TIME.

27:59.290 --> 28:03.630
SO, WHY WASN'T IT BIGGER NEWS THEN?
I MEAN I HEARD ABOUT IT -

28:03.630 --> 28:06.000
BUT IF SOME CRAZY CULT WAS RUNNING
THROUGH THE WOODS, I MEAN...

28:06.000 --> 28:07.880
WHY WASN'T IT MAJOR NEWS?

28:07.880 --> 28:10.850
WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT IT. I
MEAN, ELECTIONS, BUSINESS...

28:10.850 --> 28:13.670
IF YOU MAKE MONEY IN THIS AREA YOU
DON'T WANT PUBLICITY LIKE THAT.

28:13.670 --> 28:17.000
YEAH, AND THE 7 OR 8 PEOPLE THEY
KILLED WEREN'T FROM AROUND HERE.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.500
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:18.500 --> 28:22.010
MOST PEOPLE THAT WENT MISSING WERE FROM...
OTHER COUNTIES OR...

28:22.010 --> 28:23.640
THEY WERE JUST DRIVING THROUGH.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.000
THAT'S HOW YOU GO UNNOTICED.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.640
BUT THEY'RE ALL DEAD OR IN JAIL RIGHT?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.330
DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO.

28:34.330 --> 28:38.950
I SAW SOME OF THE INTERVIEWS AND
MY UNCLE SAID DIFFERENT THINGS.

28:38.950 --> 28:43.070
WELL, THERE'S TWO MAIN GUYS.
HURAM OR HURAN.

28:43.070 --> 28:46.240
AND, THEY FOUND HIM WITH
HIS FACE RIPPED OFF.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.820
MOST OF HIS BLOOD DRAINED. SOME
KIND OF A FINAL RITUAL I THINK.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.680
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.890
AND 3 OF THE FOLLOWERS THEY
ARRESTED ALL SAID DIFFERENT THINGS.

28:57.890 --> 29:01.190
ONE OF THEM BLAMED IT
ALL ON SOME GUY WHO...

29:01.190 --> 29:04.270
TALKED THEM INTO IT BUT NEVER
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED.

29:04.270 --> 29:08.690
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN EXTENSION
OF, 'THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT'.

29:08.690 --> 29:10.730
YOU KNOW? EASY SCAPEGOAT.

29:10.730 --> 29:11.990
HOPEFULLY.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.560
ALRIGHT, CREEPSHOW IS OVER.

29:17.060 --> 29:19.640
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.920
HEY. THAT WAS NINE YEARS AGO.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.060
WELL, WHAT IF THAT PERSON
IS STILL OUT THERE?

29:46.060 --> 29:48.840
WHAT ABOUT THAT MAN WE SAW EARLIER?

29:48.840 --> 29:54.000
HEY, LIKE THE OTHERS SAID IT WAS
PROBABLY JUST SOME WEIRD HERMIT.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.790
BURNING PERSONAL PAPERS.

29:56.790 --> 29:58.580
OR SOMETHING.

29:58.580 --> 30:02.420
HEY, DON'T WORRY. YOU'VE
GOT TWO PARK RANGERS.

30:03.020 --> 30:04.160
AND ME.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.800
AND WHATEVER SHE IS.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.070
YEAH, NOPE.

31:25.070 --> 31:26.570
HELLO?

31:32.270 --> 31:36.100
PIZZA'S HERE. IN CASE YOU'RE BACK.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.950
GUESS I KNOW WHAT YOU
DO WITH YOUR WEEKENDS.

33:57.460 --> 34:00.730
I - I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT.

34:00.730 --> 34:02.220
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:02.220 --> 34:04.030
SOMEONE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR.

34:04.030 --> 34:07.080
I WENT AND ANSWERED IT
AND THERE WAS NOBODY THERE.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.989
SO I - I STEPPED OUTSIDE
TO LOOK AROUND AND...

34:09.989 --> 34:14.000
BIG... BIG GUY IN A HOOD RUSHED ME, AND...

34:14.000 --> 34:18.270
I WOKE UP LIKE THIS AND...
I GOT MY HANDS, AND...

34:18.270 --> 34:20.190
CAN YOU HELP ME?

34:20.190 --> 34:21.830
YEAH...

34:21.830 --> 34:24.239
I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE,
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE YOU.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.100
GOOD. GOOD.

34:28.870 --> 34:32.000
MY CELL'S IN THE CAR. I'M
GOING TO RUN OUT AND GET IT.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.929
NO USE - USE MY PHONE.

34:33.929 --> 34:35.610
IT'S ON THE COUNTER IN THE KITCHEN.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.770
ON THE LEFT. UNDER THE CABINET.

34:51.659 --> 34:52.980
DO YOU SEE IT?

34:56.580 --> 34:59.000
WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU CALLING?

35:19.020 --> 35:20.570
COME ON, COME ON.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.200
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.000
I NEED TO CUT YOU LOSE, WE HAVE TO HIDE.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.820
WHY? DIDN'T YOU CALL? >>I TRIED.
PHONE'S OUT.

35:37.820 --> 35:40.150
OH, NO NO NO.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.390
JUST GO KID. GET OUT OF HERE.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.360
I'M NOT JUST GOING TO LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.610
NO SENSE IN BOTH OF US DYING.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.840
GO TO YOUR CAR. CALL FOR HELP.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.000
COME ON, GO. GO.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.670
WHERE IS SHE?

36:29.370 --> 36:33.000
LIE TO ME AND
I'LL SHOOT YOUR KNEECAPS OUT.

36:34.340 --> 36:36.780
YOU KNOW I'M ALREADY DEAD.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.040
AND MY KNEES BEEN REPLACED.
BOTH OF THEM.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.550
SO NO BIG DEAL TO ME.

36:43.150 --> 36:48.210
I LIKE YOUR SPIRIT.
IT REMINDS ME OF MY OLD MAN.

36:48.210 --> 36:50.220
WANT TO KNOW WHAT I DID TO HIM?

36:52.340 --> 36:55.450
OKAY, OKAY. SHE'S HERE. SHE'S HERE.

36:55.450 --> 36:58.360
I TOLD HER TO HIDE IN MY ROOM.
IT'S DOWN THE HALL TO THE LEFT.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.280
SHE MAY HAVE GONE OUT THE
WINDOW, I DON'T KNOW.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.950
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME.

37:05.950 --> 37:08.210
I'M NOT. I'M NOT, I SWEAR.

37:08.210 --> 37:10.000
I SWEAR...

37:13.330 --> 37:14.760
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.810
YOU BETTER TELL ME THE TRUTH.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.360
NOW LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.650
WHERE IS SHE?

37:40.250 --> 37:42.870
I'M NOT. I...

37:45.870 --> 37:47.680
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.080
WORKS FOR ME.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.320
HOW THE HELL?

39:50.000 --> 39:53.530
WELL, IF WE WEREN'T BEST FRIENDS BEFORE.

39:53.530 --> 39:55.070
YEAH, THANKS.

39:55.070 --> 39:57.420
MUST BE A WATERFALL
AROUND HERE, HUH GIRLS?

39:57.420 --> 40:00.210
OH, SHUT UP NATE! >>
Nate: DON'T GO CHASING THEM!

40:00.210 --> 40:02.990
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I AGREED TO THIS.

40:02.990 --> 40:04.740
YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

40:04.740 --> 40:08.240
YEAH, CAUSE I'M AWESOME. IT'S
ALWAYS A GOOD TIME WHEN I'M AROUND.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.370
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, OR OTHERWISE.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.720
TOUCHE'.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.420
I MEAN, COME ON. IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT OUTSIDE.

40:16.420 --> 40:18.110
THE FIRE'S NICE.
THE STARS ARE GORGEOUS.

40:18.110 --> 40:22.200
AND I'M HERE TAKING A PISS UNDER
THIS GIANT TREE LIKE A NEANDERTHAL.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.310
I MEAN, THIS IS BS.

40:24.310 --> 40:27.270
YEAH, I PROBABLY COULD'VE
PREPARED YOU A LITTLE BETTER.

40:27.270 --> 40:30.460
I THOUGHT SLEEPING OUTSIDE ON THE
GROUND WOULD BE THE BIG THING.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.420
YEAH, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT.

40:34.020 --> 40:36.240
YOU'LL BE FINE.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.880
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

40:41.380 --> 40:44.420
THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.

40:44.920 --> 40:49.080
IT'S LIKE PEEING IN THE STALL NEXT TO MINE.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.040
NO BIG DEAL.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.970
I'M SORRY I MADE FUN OF YOU
FOR BEING A GIRL SCOUT.

40:53.970 --> 40:55.420
FORGIVEN.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.790
WHEN WE GET HOME, I'LL BUY ALL
OF YOUR COOKIES. I PROMISE.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.450
SHUT UP.

41:06.910 --> 41:11.180
RELAX. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ALL
KINDS OF STUFF WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP.

41:11.180 --> 41:14.430
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE UP ALL NIGHT
AT EVERY LITTLE SOUND, DO YOU?

41:14.430 --> 41:17.610
NO, I'M SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT
NO MATTER HOW MANY DRINKS IT TAKES.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.660
COME ON.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.990
SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT, PETE?

41:45.490 --> 41:47.830
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

41:47.830 --> 41:52.050
POSITION OF THE MOON CAN VARY BUT IT
SHOULD BE THE SAME AS LAST NIGHT.

41:52.850 --> 41:54.540
THINK SOMEONE MOVED YOUR MARKERS?

41:56.040 --> 41:58.000
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT, YET.

41:59.620 --> 42:03.490
WELL, WE GOT A HUNTER AND
DARKMAN OUT HERE WITH US.

42:03.490 --> 42:07.430
MAYBE ONE OF THEM WANTED US A LITTLE
FARTHER AWAY FROM THEIR SPOT.

42:07.430 --> 42:09.590
I DON'T THINK I'M COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT, I MEAN...

42:09.590 --> 42:13.390
TAMPERING WITH SOMEONE'S TRAIL IS...
DANGEROUS.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.310
YEAH, WELL...

42:15.310 --> 42:17.420
IF YOU FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT,
WE CAN ALWAYS MOVE TOMORROW.

42:17.420 --> 42:19.010
GO BACK CLOSER TO THE TRAIL.

42:20.710 --> 42:21.990
MAYBE.

42:30.100 --> 42:32.000
EVERYTHING OKAY?

42:32.000 --> 42:34.270
YEAH. I WAS JUST GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED.

42:34.270 --> 42:36.900
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
SOMEONE HAS TO PEE IN THE MOVIE.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.620
WHAT HAPPENS?

42:40.420 --> 42:42.480
FOR EXAMPLE.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.910
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM, RIGHT?

42:44.910 --> 42:47.000
BUT INSTEAD OF HOPPING BEHIND
THAT BIG TREE OVER THERE -

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I'M GOING TO GO AT LEAST A
HALF MILE DOWN INTO THE WOODS.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.130
WHY?

42:51.130 --> 42:55.400
WELL. MAYBE IF I'M TRYING TO SQUEEZE OUT
ONE LAST DROP AND LET OUT A BIG FART.

42:57.860 --> 43:01.050
OR MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE TOO
COLD OUT AND SOMEONE'S WATCHING -

43:01.050 --> 43:03.130
I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET THE WRONG IDEA.

43:03.130 --> 43:05.540
WHATEVER THE CASE I'VE GOTTA PUT A
MILE BETWEEN ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.400
NOW, IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND
GIVING US SOME PRIVACY.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.940
SURE THING.

43:26.140 --> 43:28.630
HEY. WHAT WERE
YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

43:28.630 --> 43:30.420
SOMEONE MOVED YOUR MARKERS?

43:30.420 --> 43:33.500
UM, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

43:33.500 --> 43:36.030
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE JUST
REMEMBERED IT WRONG.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.520
IT WAS LATE LAST NIGHT, IT'S NOTHING.

44:01.000 --> 44:01.030
NICE JOB.

44:03.030 --> 44:04.810
COVERING YOUR TRACKS.

44:09.310 --> 44:11.310
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE SMART.

44:12.010 --> 44:15.980
WHICH MEANS YOU WON'T VENTURE
TOO DEEP OUT INTO THE DARKNESS.

44:21.380 --> 44:23.400
WHICH MEANS...

44:26.630 --> 44:28.190
WHICH MEANS...

44:31.590 --> 44:32.990
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

44:37.540 --> 44:41.590
NOW... I KNOW
I'M NOT GOING TO FIND YA.

44:42.590 --> 44:44.580
AND I DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT.

44:46.180 --> 44:49.450
SO, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

44:51.160 --> 44:55.550
YOU ARE GOING TO COME OUT. RIGHT NOW!

44:57.550 --> 45:02.120
OR I'M GOING TO GO OUT THESE
WOODS, GET IN MY CAR...

45:02.130 --> 45:04.490
AND DRIVE.

45:04.490 --> 45:07.010
TO TWO-ZERO-ONE...

45:08.010 --> 45:10.840
...LEEDS LANE.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.330
THAT'S RIGHT.

45:16.330 --> 45:18.200
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR NIECE.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.420
I'M NOT GOING TO KILL HER.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.290
BUT I AM GOING
TO DO OTHER THINGS.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.730
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

45:33.330 --> 45:34.640
NOW...

45:35.640 --> 45:37.480
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU TILL TEN.

45:41.180 --> 45:42.500
ONE.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.490
TWO.

45:49.190 --> 45:50.310
THREE.

45:52.310 --> 45:53.550
FOUR.

45:55.250 --> 45:58.940
FIVE. SIX.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.800
SEVEN.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.440
EIGHT.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.380
NINE.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.380
TEN.

46:44.010 --> 46:47.450
WAS THAT AS GOOD FOR YOU, AS IT WAS FOR ME?

47:21.860 --> 47:23.650
THANKS FOR MAKING ME COME.

47:24.150 --> 47:25.550
I TOLD YOU, YOU'D LIKE IT.

47:27.650 --> 47:31.220
IT'S LIKE IT'S QUIET ENOUGH FOR ME TO
THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.460
YEAH...

47:33.460 --> 47:36.200
YOU SHOULD DO IT MORE OFTEN. I
MEAN I KNOW IT'S HARD TO...

47:36.200 --> 47:39.340
...THINK, WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT AS MUCH.

47:39.340 --> 47:41.950
DON'T RUIN THE MOMENT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

47:41.950 --> 47:43.450
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

47:43.950 --> 47:46.400
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD WHEN
THERE'S NOT AS MANY DISTRACTIONS.

47:56.300 --> 47:58.660
BUT... AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE.

47:58.660 --> 48:01.210
NATURE CALLS. I'VE GOT TO PISS.
I'LL BE BACK.

48:03.110 --> 48:04.570
MOMENT OFFICIALLY RUINED.

48:04.570 --> 48:05.630
YEP.

48:10.330 --> 48:12.400
I'M GOING TO TAKE A PISS EVERYONE.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.770
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HEAR AND I
DON'T WANT JESS GETTING REALLY EXCITED-

48:14.770 --> 48:16.880
SO I'M GOING SUPER FAR.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.500
SO FAR SO GOOD? >>YES. LOVE IT.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.920
ACRYLICS ARE SUCH A PAIN.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.370
I'M STILL WALKING.

48:31.370 --> 48:35.270
IT'S DARK AS HELL OUT HERE BUT,
I DON'T THINK I'M FAR ENOUGH YET.

48:35.270 --> 48:38.250
>>WHAT A JERK!

48:38.250 --> 48:41.500
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? CAN YOU?

48:42.500 --> 48:44.580
WE CAN HEAR YOU!

48:49.470 --> 48:51.380
ALRIGHT, I'M GOING TO
KEEP WALKING TILL YOU CAN'T.

48:51.380 --> 48:56.580
CAUSE YOU HEARING ME PEE IS SCARIER
THAN ANY SERIAL KILLER OUT HERE!

48:57.280 --> 49:00.060
JUST PEE AND GET
BACK HERE YOU BIG DUMMY!

49:01.880 --> 49:03.490
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

49:11.640 --> 49:13.540
NATE, CUT IT OUT!

49:18.000 --> 49:20.700
WOULD YOU HELP ME? IT'S A BEAR TRAP!

49:22.200 --> 49:23.280
WHAT?

49:28.000 --> 49:29.690
IS THIS A JOKE?

49:29.690 --> 49:32.300
PETER, I'VE NEVER
HEARD HIM SOUND LIKE THAT.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.400
WAIT HERE.

49:33.400 --> 49:46.180
- BUT WHAT IF IT'S...
- JUST WAIT HERE!

49:46.180 --> 49:48.350
I CAN'T GET LOOSE, I NEED HELP!

49:53.350 --> 49:55.510
MAN, THIS BETTER NOT BE A JOKE!

50:00.110 --> 50:01.920
HURRY UP, I CAN SEE YOUR LIGHT.

50:19.420 --> 50:20.930
COME ON!

50:29.790 --> 50:33.490
WE WERE ALL AROUND THIS SITE.
HOW DID THAT GET THERE?

50:36.190 --> 50:38.380
WE HAVE TO GET THE FIRST AID KIT.

50:38.380 --> 50:42.370
I MEAN, THE CUTS AREN'T THAT
BAD BUT THERE'S BRUISING...

50:42.370 --> 50:44.220
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX HIM UP.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.740
GO GET IT.

50:45.740 --> 50:46.850
GIVE ME THE LIGHT.

50:49.250 --> 50:51.300
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON, MAN?

50:51.300 --> 50:52.740
I DON'T KNOW.

50:52.740 --> 50:55.200
I WAS WALKING, I HEARD SOMETHING
FROM OVER THERE, AND...

50:56.000 --> 50:58.150
I WENT TO CHECK IT OUT AND...

51:00.000 --> 51:01.850
THAT WAS THAT...

51:47.600 --> 51:48.860
PETE?

51:50.060 --> 51:51.510
PETER?

51:53.010 --> 51:55.120
NATE?

51:55.120 --> 51:57.490
ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT HAPPENED?

52:01.290 --> 52:04.620
WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THE TENT.

52:04.620 --> 52:06.000
RIGHT NOW!

52:07.570 --> 52:08.940
SHE'S RIGHT.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.500
WHAT ABOUT PETER?

52:57.190 --> 52:59.310
JESSICA, HELP ME WITH HIM. NOW!

53:00.610 --> 53:01.690
JESS!

55:10.110 --> 55:11.310
GO TO HELL!

55:11.310 --> 55:14.200
WE HAVE A GUN. WE WILL SHOOT YOU!

55:44.000 --> 55:47.360
IN HERE BRITT. FRONT ZIPPER, THERE'S A GUN.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.880
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

56:01.880 --> 56:05.380
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE IT
WOULD SCARE HIM OFF.

56:05.380 --> 56:08.270
YEAH WELL, NOW IF HE COMES BACK
IT WON'T BE AN EMPTY THREAT.

56:08.270 --> 56:09.680
YOU BROUGHT A GUN.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.890
YEAH. I ALWAYS BRING A
GUN WHEN I GO CAMPING.

56:11.890 --> 56:13.670
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN INTO.

56:16.170 --> 56:19.570
DO EITHER OF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT?
BESIDES NATE?

56:19.570 --> 56:23.070
I USED TO GO TO THE RANGE WITH
MY PARENTS AS A KID, BUT...

56:23.070 --> 56:25.120
I WAS OKAY.

56:25.120 --> 56:28.020
I'VE NEVER FIRED ONE BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

56:28.720 --> 56:29.880
JESS KNOWS.

56:32.180 --> 56:36.100
HE TOOK ME. ONCE. A FEW MONTHS AGO.

56:36.100 --> 56:38.050
YOU WERE ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

56:38.050 --> 56:40.160
IN A RANGE AT A TARGET BOARD.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.710
YEAH, WELL. THAT'S GOING
TO HAVE TO DO FOR NOW.

56:42.710 --> 56:47.120
IF HE COMES BACK, EITHER YOU LEARN
QUICK OR WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.540
GOT IT?

56:54.740 --> 56:57.310
HE MUST'VE SET US UP.

56:57.310 --> 57:01.000
PETE SAID SOMEBODY MOVED HIS MARKERS.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.060
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT.

57:03.060 --> 57:05.650
BUT, MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT.

57:05.650 --> 57:07.370
MAYBE HE WANTED US HERE.

57:38.450 --> 57:40.880
ALRIGHT. THANKS FOR THE CALL.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.550
THAT'S ENOUGH NOW. BRING IT IN.

57:49.750 --> 57:53.750
I DIDN'T NEED A BREAK.
I CAN KEEP GOING.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.750
I DON'T DOUBT IT.

57:55.750 --> 57:58.490
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE
CALLING DYFUS ON ME.

57:58.490 --> 58:00.980
BESIDES YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE ARE GIVING
ME A HARD ENOUGH TIME AS IT IS-

58:00.980 --> 58:02.260
FOR PUSHING YOU TOO MUCH.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.450
I CAN TAKE IT.

58:04.450 --> 58:06.680
OF COURSE YOU CAN, YOU'VE
GOT MY BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.300
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

58:08.800 --> 58:10.510
COME ON, HONEY. HAVE A SEAT.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.780
WE WALK THE REST OF THE WAY.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.780
MY BOSS IS GOING TO CALL THE COPS.

58:26.780 --> 58:28.610
THEY'LL FIND MY CAR.

58:28.610 --> 58:32.610
THEY WILL. BUT WE'RE
20 MILES AWAY FROM THERE.

58:32.610 --> 58:35.850
AND THE LAST FIVE...
HAVE BEEN OFF ROAD.

58:35.850 --> 58:39.100
IT'LL BE A FEW DAYS BEFORE
THEY EVEN THINK TO LOOK HERE.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.550
AT LEAST.

58:52.480 --> 58:57.370
I GOT A PHONE CALL ABOUT YOUR....

58:57.370 --> 58:58.740
YOUR BIOLOGICAL.

59:01.240 --> 59:05.580
IT LOOKS LIKE UH.. HE... HURT SOMEONE ELSE.

59:06.280 --> 59:08.010
SO, HE'S IN JAIL.

59:09.810 --> 59:11.320
ISN'T THAT GOOD?

59:12.720 --> 59:15.000
YES, BUT...

59:15.000 --> 59:16.290
NOT FOR HER.

59:18.390 --> 59:20.030
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

59:20.030 --> 59:21.730
IF I HADN'T JUST RUN FROM HIM...

59:23.730 --> 59:25.850
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE
RIGHT THING, YOU KNOW?

59:25.850 --> 59:27.410
STAY ON THE MOVE, KEEP US SAFE, BUT...

59:29.410 --> 59:30.760
I WAS WRONG.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
I SHOULD'VE STOOD UP TO HIM.
OR AT LEAST REPORTED HIM.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.910
THEN SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN HURT.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.390
I WENT OVERSEAS TO FIGHT AND...

59:46.390 --> 59:48.230
RAN FROM MY BATTLES AT HOME.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. >>

59:52.670 --> 59:54.640
WHETHER IT IS, OR IT ISN'T.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.940
IT ISN'T.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.040
I WANT YOU TO BE BETTER THAN ME.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.000
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO KEEP PUSHING YOU.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:08.330
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO
EVER BE ANYBODY'S VICTIM.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:09.930
NOT ANYBODY'S.

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.830
I DON'T WANT TO BE BETTER THAN YOU.

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:15.830
NOT EVER.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.680
I NEED TO GO OUT THERE.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.990
WHAT? WHY?

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:00.490
NATE ISN'T LOOKING SO GREAT.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.200
BETTER THAN YOU ON MY WORST DAY. OW.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.810
MAYBE, BUT
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.870
ARE YOU CRAZY? WHY WOULD YOU GO OUT THERE?

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:10.570
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE, JESS?

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:12.940
JUST.. SIT HERE AND PRAY FOR MORNING?

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.120
AND HOPE THAT PSYCHOPATH DOESN'T COME BACK?

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.830
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I MEAN,
WHAT IF YOU RUN INTO HIM OUT THERE?

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.780
MAYBE HE'S GONE.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.440
WE CAN WAIT TILL MORNING AND LEAVE THEN.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.510
YOU TOLD US BEFORE IT'S NOT SAFE
TO BE GOING OUT IN THE DARKNESS.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:30.720
IT'S RISKY.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.430
YEAH...

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.810
THAT WAS BEFORE NATE GOT HURT.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:38.170
I MEAN... IT'S NOT LIKE MY
LEG'S GOING TO COME OFF.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.480
I'LL BE FINE.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.910
MAYBE. BUT...

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.000
THAT TRAP WASN'T NEW. YOU
DEFINITELY NEED A TETANUS SHOT.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.810
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE
COULD'VE COVERED IT WITH.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.410
IT COULD'VE BEEN COVERED IN POISON.

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:54.280
POISON? OKAY, NOW YOU'RE
JUST TALKING CRAZY.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.900
HE'S SWEATING AND IT'S 40 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.080
LOOK AT HIM.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.380
LOOK AT HIM!

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.460
ALRIGHT, DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT ME!

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.310
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.
I DON'T WANT ANY OF US TO DIE.

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.670
AND PETER IS STILL OUT THERE ALONE.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:19.720
IF I GET THE POLICE HERE,
MAYBE WE CAN HELP HIM.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.360
SITTING AROUND HERE WAITING
FOR THAT PSYCHOPATH TO COME BACK-

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.280
IS JUST A REALLY BAD IDEA.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.370
OUR CARS ARE... ABOUT TEN MILES AWAY.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.750
THAT'S A HIKE EVEN IN THE
DAYLIGHT, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:34.150
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT TO THE CARS.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.200
WE FOUND A SIGNAL. REMEMBER?

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.860
JUST LIKE, A MILE BEYOND
THAT OTHER GUY'S TENT?

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.370
THAT'S HOW FAR I'D HAVE TO GET.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.580
WHAT? THREE MILES.
MAYBE FOUR. TOPS.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.550
ABOUT THAT, YEAH.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.850
YOU'RE TAKING THE GUN WITH YOU.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.140
NO, IF HE COMES BACK HERE YOU
GUYS ARE GOING TO NEED IT.

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.220
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING HERE WITHOUT PROTECTION.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.500
SERIOUSLY?

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.920
IV'E USED IT TO START FIRES BEFORE.
IT'LL WORK.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.200
TRUST ME.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.340
YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.080
SOMEONE'S GOTTA BE.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.900
MAYBE I CAN COME WITH YOU.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.550
MAYBE IT'S SAFER IF IT'S TWO OF US.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.450
NAH, I'LL GO FASTER ON MY OWN.
AND MORE QUIETLY.

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.140
JUST...

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.750
HOLD DOWN THE FORT, TILL I COME BACK.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.650
OKAY?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.720
I WILL.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.090
DON'T WORRY.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.760
I DIDN'T BRING YOU OUT HERE FOR THAT.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.700
HELL...

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.620
THAT'S WHY I HAVE THIS PLACE.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:32.630
SO I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY
NEEDS WITHOUT HAVING TO HURT ANYONE.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:35.100
YOU THINK LOOKING AT LITTLE GIRLS
IN THE WOODS IS ANY BETTER?

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.720
LOOK. IF MY DAD HAD DONE THIS...

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.580
MAYBE MY SISTER AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE TURNED OUT SO SCREWED UP.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.710
SO, YEAH.

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:46.620
LOOK. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH YOU.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.360
I NEED YOU IN GOOD CONDITION.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.320
YOU'RE BAIT.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.260
NOW LUCKY FOR YOU.
I GOT ENOUGH BLOOD FROM PAUL.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.630
SO I DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH YOURS.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.170
BUT, HE KNOWS WHAT'S IN YOUR VEINS.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.870
HE WANTS IT. AND WHEN HE COMES FOR IT...

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.690
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:08.600
NOW, IF I SUCCEED...

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.130
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR NIECE.
YOUR AUNT. YOUR UNCLE.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:14.520
IF I FAIL. HE KILLS YOU, TOO.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.420
WHAT'S IN MY VEINS?

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.650
BLOOD. O-NEGATIVE.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.700
WHO WANTS IT?

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.500
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.750
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.350
PROBABLY NOT.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.890
WE HAVE COMPANY.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:44.800
NOW, DON'T MAKE A SOUND OR
YOU'LL KILL WHOEVER'S OUT THERE.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.900
GOT IT?

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.400
I DON'T NEED ANYMORE BLOOD
ON MY HANDS TONIGHT.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.600
DON'T FORCE ME.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.200
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:21.190
UH... YEAH.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.770
I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH.

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:27.000
I NEED TO CALL THE POLICE. AND
AN AMBULANCE FOR MY FRIEND.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.200
WE WERE ATTACKED.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.970
ATTACKED. BY WHO?

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.950
I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.320
I HAVE MY PHONE WITH ME.
THERE'S RECEPTION...

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.860
ABOUT A MILE FROM HERE.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.690
HOW MANY ARE LEFT OUT THERE?

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.510
UH, THERE'S THREE PEOPLE.
ONE'S HURT REALLY BADLY.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.220
HUH.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.410
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE DEAD BY THE
TIME ANYONE GETS BACK TO THEM.

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:56.560
WHAT?

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.480
YOU KIDS ARE SO DENSE.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.510
DIDN'T YOU REALIZE YOUR MARKERS WERE MOVED?

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:04.610
WHEN I FIRST SAW
YOUR FRIEND LAST NIGHT.

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:06.400
I WAS PISSED.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.300
THEN I REALIZED...

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.990
THEY COULD BUY ME SOME TIME.

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.220
APPARENTLY THEY DID.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.460
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.979
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A PERMIT.

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:25.840
UM... TO BE OUT HERE. I'LL...
I'LL SHOW YOU.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.210
I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO PERMIT.

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:30.430
BUT I AM GOING TO
SUGGEST THAT YOU AND YOUR-

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:45.109
THAT WASN'T SMART.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.460
GO TO HELL!

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.430
YOU LED US OUT HERE?
TO THAT FREAK?

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.420
ONLY THREE MILES FROM WHERE
YOUR FRIENDS SET UP.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.180
CLOSE ENOUGH THAT I'VE SEEN
HIM THERE TWO OR THREE TIMES.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.529
WHY?

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:02.660
HAD SOME PLACE TO GO.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.790
NEEDED HIM TO STAY BUSY WITH YOU GUYS...
TILL I MADE MY MOVE.

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:09.319
WHY US?

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.990
WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:13.970
NOTHING PERSONAL.

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.439
WELL, NOT UNTIL YOU TRIED
TO BURN MY FACE OFF.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.760
PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE.

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:32.270
DON'T WORRY. I'M
NOT GOING TO USE THIS ON YOU.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:35.240
NOT UNLESS YOU MAKE ME.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.670
BUT THAT FIGHT IN YOU...

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:40.710
IT'S GOT ME EXCITED.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.140
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PENETRATE YOU.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.880
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME YOU... FILTHY...

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.600
WHAT'S WRONG, JESS? >>QUIET.

01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:01.170
TAKE IT EASY, BOTH OF YOU.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.870
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TAKE IT EASY?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:06.530
I'M NOT SURE. IT WOKE ME
UP LIKE TEN MINUTES AGO.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:09.130
IT WAS FURTHER AWAY THEN. I
WAS HOPING IT WOULD JUST PASS US.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.890
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE SCREAMING.
WHAT IF IT'S PETER...

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:17.000
IT'S NOT HUMAN. IT SOUNDS
LIKE A MOUNTAIN LION.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.300
MOUNTAIN LION?

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.370
YEAH.

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:23.830
THERE AREN'T ANY MOUNTAIN
LIONS AROUND HERE.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.700
THAT'S WHY I SAID, 'SOUNDS LIKE'.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.690
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TEN
MINUTES AND YOU DIDN'T WAKE ME UP.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.580
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.860
EXCEPT NOW, YOU'RE
JUST UP WORRYING ABOUT IT.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.430
JUST BE QUIET. WHATEVER IT IS -
HOPEFULLY, IT'LL JUST PASS US.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.590
CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:19.060
YEAH, GIVE ME IT.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.990
NATE.

01:12:58.690 --> 01:12:59.990
NATE?

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:05.930
DON'T!

01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:07.300
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.770
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.200
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.900
GO AWAY OR I'LL SHOOT!

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:19.290
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT GUN IS GOING TO WORK?

01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:22.990
JESSICA.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.630
I ONLY WANT... ONE OF YOU.

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:44.520
YOU DECIDE WHICH BEFORE I GET BACK.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.860
OR YOU BOTH DIE.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.000
YOU WANT ME TO SET IT?

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.740
YOU KNOW HOW?

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.370
BEFORE I BECAME A JERK IN HIGH
SCHOOL I WAS A GIRL SCOUT.

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:15.200
ONE OF MY LEADERS
THOUGHT SHE WAS LARA CROFT.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.990
I'VE LEARNED A THING OR TWO ABOUT INJURIES.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:35.150
I'M GOING TO COUNT TO THREE. OKAY?

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.930
OKAY.

01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:40.030
ONE...

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.800
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.200
BRITTANY, RIGHT?

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.980
YEAH. HOW'D YOU REMEMBER?

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.030
I WAS TOLD TO PRAY FOR MY ENEMIES. SO...

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:12.500
I USED IT. A LOT.

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:17.470
AND WHAT DO I CALL YOU?

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:18.870
BESIDES 'HOMESCHOOL'?

01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:22.340
AYA.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.540
FRESH START.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.830
YEAH.

01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.330
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:34.540
MAYBE WE CAN SIGN EACH OTHER'S
YEARBOOKS WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.000
WE SHOULD GET A SLING ON THAT.
IT WAS REALLY BAD.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.810
WHO ELSE WAS CAMPING WITH YOU?

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.070
UH... JESSICA. AJ. PETER AND NATE.

01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:55.000
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO PETER AND...
NATE'S HURT REALLY BAD.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.540
I CAME OUT HERE TO GET A SIGNAL.
TO CALL FOR HELP.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.200
I'M GOING TO HEAD DOWN TO YOUR SITE.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.470
WHAT? WHY?

01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:08.320
THAT'S WHERE THAT JERK WAS HEADED.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.810
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOUR FRIENDS
ARE UP AGAINST, BUT...

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:14.220
SOMETHING TELLS ME THEY WON'T
MAKE IT UNTIL HELP GETS HERE.

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.000
'UNFORTUNATELY, THE STATE
IS DENYING AN APPEAL.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.320
IT'S CLEAR THERE WAS AN
UNIDENTIFIED PARTY INVOLVED-

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.430
- REGARDLESS OF HOW PASSIVE
HIS ROLE MIGHT'VE BEEN.

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:45.000
HOWEVER, THAT WON'T CHANGE THE
ACTIONS YOUR SISTER TOOK.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.950
ALSO, THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
AND COUNTY REALLY JUST WANT TO -

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.230
- PUT THIS ENTIRE MATTER BEHIND THEM.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:52.390
THEY RECEIVED A COPY OF THE
FOOTAGE I PROVIDED YOU WITH,

01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:54.720
BUT MADE IT CLEAR IT WOULDN'T BE
ADMISSIBLE IN COURT BECAUSE OF

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.060
THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS OBTAINED.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.070
I'LL KEEP PUSHING BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S GOING TO MATTER.

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:03.830
I'D RECOMMEND IN THE MEANTIME THAT
YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOUR SISTER.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:06.900
SHE'LL NEED YOUR FAMILIAR FACE TO
HELP HER THROUGH HER RECOVERY.'

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.900
SHE WAS IN A VIDEO I FOUND HERE EARLIER.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.410
MINA.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.330
SHE'S HIS SISTER?

01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:19.260
LOOKS LIKE IT.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:27.450
I THINK HE'S GOING AFTER
THE MAN THEY WERE REFERENCING HERE.

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:30.200
I THINK HE'S THE ONE WHO ATTACKED US.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.590
I'M GOING TO GO.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.800
I'M COMING WITH YOU. >>NO.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.840
YOU SHOULD GO CALL THE POLICE.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.220
THE SOONER WE GET HELP HERE THE BETTER.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.940
AND I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.370
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO OUT THERE
ALONE WITH YOUR SHOULDER MESSED UP.

01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:53.060
PERIOD.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.430
SO, WHERE'D YOU LEARN HOW
TO HANDLE A GUN SO WELL?

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:20.000
THAT WHAT THEY TEACH YOU AT HOME SCHOOL?

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.770
MY MOM WAS IN THE ARMY, SO... KIND OF.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.190
BRITTANY.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.700
PETER.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.720
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.990
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.850
NATE'S DEAD.

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:24.910
THE OTHERS... I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:30.740
HE DRAGGED ME BACK HERE.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.330
I THINK I LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:33.650
I DON'T HAVE LONG.

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:40.160
HE WAS DRINKING MY BLOOD.
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.920
WE NEED TO GO. RIGHT NOW.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.320
BRITTANY, YOUR FRIENDS NEED US.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.370
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS.

01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:58.200
LOOK, I'M SORRY BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE LONG.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.890
YOUR FRIENDS ARE STILL ALIVE. FOR NOW.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:06.870
I'M NOT LEAVING. HELP ME WITH HIM.

01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:27.980
GO WITH HER.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.610
PLEASE. FIND THE OTHERS.

01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:32.360
DON'T WASTE TIME WITH ME.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.430
NO, IT'S NOT A WASTE.

01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:37.570
DID YOU CALL FOR HELP, ALREADY?

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:41.270
NO, I...

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:45.270
I RAN INTO HER AND WE CAME BACK
HERE TO FIND YOU AND THE OTHERS.

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:48.960
THERE'S A HUNTER OUT HERE.
HE'S... DANGEROUS.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.200
YOU CAN'T STOP THE BLEEDING.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.220
IT'S ALL OVER.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.780
LEAVE HER ALONE!

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.970
LET'S FIND THE OTHERS.

01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:32.000
WE'LL NEED THE BULLETS.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.850
OKAY.

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:50.850
WE FOLLOW THE BLOOD.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.920
IF HE'S USING THEM AS BAIT HE
HAS TO BE WATCHING FROM SOMEWHERE.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.600
WE CAN'T JUST RUN OUT INTO THE OPEN.

01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:37.110
>>SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:41.240
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO USE A GUN?

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.420
NO. WHY?

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:47.140
I COULD RUN OUT THERE. GET HIS ATTENTION.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:51.480
IF HE MAKES A MOVE ON ME,
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE HE'S HIDING.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.000
THEY HAD A GUN, WHICH MEANS HE HAS IT NOW.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.790
IF YOU GO OUT THERE HE COULD SHOOT
YOU BEFORE I SEE HIM COMING.

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:58.880
I KNOW.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.680
KEEP THE GUN.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:06.070
I'D PROBABLY JUST END UP SHOOTING YOU.

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:08.770
FAIR ENOUGH.

01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:12.200
WATCH MY BACK. IF YOU SEE
ANYTHING, SHOUT TO ME.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.880
THANK YOU.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.000
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.950
I'M WITH BRITTANY. WE'RE GOING
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:36.600
BRITTANY'S OKAY?

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.800
THANK GOD.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.940
WE WERE AT OUR CAMP, AND
THIS GUY SHOWED UP.

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:49.950
HE DESCRIBED BRITTANY. AND SAID
THAT SHE HAD GONE LOOKING FOR HELP.

01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:52.360
AFTER THEY GOT ATTACKED.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.000
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER, BUT...

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.100
HE HAD A PLACE WITH A RADIO
WHERE WE COULD CALL FOR HELP.

01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:02.280
WE FOLLOWED HIM BACK HERE
BUT HE TOOK OUR GUN.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.600
AND TIED US UP.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.910
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS, NOW?

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:08.050
HE WENT OFF THAT WAY.

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.690
DROP THE GUN OR I SHOOT.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.000
SCREW YOU.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.160
I'LL DO IT. >>DON'T PUT IT DOWN, AYA.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.340
HE'S JUST GOING TO KILL ALL OF US, ANYWAY.

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.240
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE OTHER
GIRLS, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.470
YOU ESCAPED
SO THEY TOOK YOUR PLACE.

01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:29.660
NOW, GIVE YOURSELF UP. I'LL LET THEM GO.

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:31.780
YOU'LL LET US GO TO CALL THE COPS?

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.810
BY THE TIME THE COPS GET HERE-

01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:36.310
I'LL HAVE ALREADY DONE MY JOB AND
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:38.520
AS LONG AS THAT THING IS DEAD.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.970
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, AYA.
IF YOU HAVE A CLEAN SHOT TAKE IT.

01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:43.990
SHUT UP!

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.230
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.

01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:51.470
YOU WILLING TO PUT A HOLE IN THIS
PRETTY LITTLE THING JUST TO GET TO ME?

01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:53.990
IF NOT. PUT THE GUN DOWN.

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:03.920
COME ON, YOU'RE WASTING TIME.
DON'T MAKE ME COUNT DOWN.

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.940
OKAY.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.200
OKAY.

01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.740
AYA, DON'T.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.200
SMART GIRL. NOW KICK IT TO ME.

01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:38.510
NO!

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.200
DROP IT... OR I'LL...

01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:50.990
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.830
IT'S ME YOU WANT, RIGHT?

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:20.930
STOP!

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:50.330
AYA. IT'S DEAD.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.560
IT'S DEAD.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.220
HE... THE HUNTER HAD THE STAKE.

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:12.440
I SAW HIM WITH IT EARLIER.

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.490
FIGURED HE PLANNED ON USING IT ON HIM.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.090
YOU SAVED US. WE WEREN'T JUST GOING TO RUN.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.800
THERE'S A RADIO IN
ONE OF THE OTHER ROOMS.

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.950
WE HEARD HIM LISTENING TO IT, EARLIER.

01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:32.000
SOME OF THE RANGERS NEARBY
HEARD ALL OF THE GUNSHOTS-

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.570
BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.

01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:35.730
WE COULD TRY IT.

01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:38.610
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO USE IT, THOUGH.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.660
I DO.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.680
LET'S GO.

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.650
HEY.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.810
I'M SORRY. I LOST CONTACT
WITH HIM ALMOST A YEAR AGO.

01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:46.450
I KNEW HE WAS TAKING THINGS
PRETTY HARD, BUT I DIDN'T...

01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:49.290
EXPECT THEM TO GO DOWN LIKE THIS.

01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:51.880
I KNEW IT WOULD.

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.000
HIS WHOLE LIFE HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME, AND...

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.910
THIS WAS ONE CASE WHERE HE COULDN'T.

01:43:57.910 --> 01:44:00.700
I DIDN'T THINK HE'D RECOVER FROM THAT.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.100
THE COPS ARE RUNNING WITH THE STORY
THAT HE DID EVERYTHING HIMSELF.

01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.130
EITHER TO PROVE THAT THE OTHER
PERSON DID EXIST, OR THAT...

01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:11.710
HE WAS IN ON IT. ALL ALONG.

01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:15.950
OF COURSE. THAT'S THE
EASIER STORY TO RUN WITH.

01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:20.530
NO LOOSE ENDS. AND IT DOESN'T SOUND INSANE.

01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:23.720
YEAH, UNLESS YOU KNOW THE DETAILS.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.320
THE GIRLS WHO SURVIVED.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.200
DID THEY SAY THERE WAS
ONLY ONE PERSON OUT THERE?

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.550
OF COURSE NOT.

01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:36.890
THE POLICE DIDN'T WANT IT GETTING
OUT BUT THEIR INITIAL STATEMENTS

01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:40.600
INCLUDED A MAN WITH SCALY
SKIN AND SHARP TEETH.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.490
HOW DID THEY DISCOUNT THE STORY?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.180
TWO OF THE GIRLS WERE
MINORS AT THE TIME AND...

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.510
THEY'D BEEN
THROUGH QUITE AN ORDEAL.

01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:56.850
SO, THE POLICE ARE ATTRIBUTING THEIR
STORY TO A SORT OF GROUP HYSTERIA.

01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:59.380
BROUGHT ON BY CALEB'S BELIEFS.

01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:02.900
AND THEY'D BEEN PROTECTED
FROM THE MEDIA, SO...

01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:05.530
THESE INITIAL STATEMENTS AREN'T WELL KNOWN.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.440
MY BROTHER...

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.220
THE GIRLS KILL HIM IN SELF DEFENSE? >>YES.

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:15.240
BUT... >>WHAT?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.260
THEIR...

01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:22.070
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS WAS
CORROBORATED BY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:25.440
EXCEPT... IT'S KIND OF GRUESOME.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.370
I DON'T KNOW IF I-

01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:28.760
WHEN THEY FOUND HIM THE SKIN
FROM HIS FACE AND NECK WAS GONE.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.380
ALONG WITH MOST OF HIS BLOOD.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.990
JUST LIKE HURAM.

01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:39.300
AND THEY'RE SAYING HE DID IT TO HIMSELF.

01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:42.030
AS PART OF THE WHOLE RITUAL.

01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:44.750
AND JUST LIKE HURAM, HE'S
GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:46.810
AND MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER KNOW.

01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:50.200
WHAT CAN WE DO?

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.770
I DON'T KNOW.

01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:58.160
I'VE STOPPED TELLING PEOPLE THE
REAL STORY BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DO

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.600
THEY JUST PUT ME ON MORE MEDICATION.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.250
HE TRICKED ALL OF US.

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:06.100
HE USED US.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:09.740
AND THEN WHEN HE GOT WHAT
HE WANTED HE JUST MOVED ON.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.550
I HAVE TO RUN TO THE STORE.

01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:30.340
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.390
I ALREADY MADE MY LAST DELIVERY AND...

01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:50.610
THIS WASN'T TOO FAR
OUT OF MY WAY, SO...

01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.220
I FIGURED I'D STOP HERE.

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:57.430
YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME GIVE
YOU SOMETHING FOR THE PIZZA.

01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:59.480
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.720
I SHOULD.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.490
ONCE THINGS GOT SETTLED I...
WANTED TO TAKE YOU OUT FOR DINNER.

01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:08.590
OR SOMETHING. IT'S
THE LEAST WE COULD DO.

01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:12.040
IT'S JUST BEEN SO INSANE LATELY.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.380
THE COPS ARE OVER EVERY OTHER DAY.
DETECTIVES, REPORTERS...

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:15.790
I GET IT.

01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:20.920
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.630
WHEN YOU'RE READY, YOU
KNOW HOW TO REACH ME.

01:47:24.130 --> 01:47:25.440
I'M AROUND.

01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:34.190
YOU SERIOUSLY STILL DELIVER PIZZAS.

01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:36.450
SERIOUSLY?

01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:40.750
EVEN STARTED THE NIGHT
SHIFT THIS WEEK, TOO.

01:47:46.750 --> 01:47:48.210
YOU GOING TO COME EAT?

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:11.600
I USED TO MAKE FUN OF HER ALL THE
TIME FOR BEING A GIRL SCOUT.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.850
BUT...

01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:19.000
WHEN SHE HELPED ME BRAVE THE
OUTDOORS I TOLD HER I'D...

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.560
BUY ALL OF HER COOKIES WHEN WE...
WHEN WE GOT HOME.

01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:30.000
IT'S KIND OF SILLY BUT, NOW
I BUY THEM WHENEVER I CAN.

01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:33.200
I DON'T THINK IT'S SILLY.

01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:37.550
REMEMBER HER ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.190
SHE SAVED ALL OUR LIVES THAT NIGHT.

01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:47.290
YOU SAVED ALL OF OUR LIVES.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.640
YOU WERE BROUGHT OUT THERE AND YOU
COULD'VE RAN BUT YOU CAME TO HELP US.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.760
I BELIEVE EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.550
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON AT FIRST, BUT...

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:06.990
I FIGURED IT OUT.

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:13.750
IF CALEB HADN'T CAUGHT ME I
WOULD'VE NEVER KNOWN ABOUT YOU.

01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:15.640
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THERE TO HELP.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:19.150
SO, IT WAS WORTH IT.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.330
I'D DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.000
THANK YOU.

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.380
WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU?
WHY SHOULD I EVEN BELIEVE YOU?

01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.770
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:40.280
YOU CAN WALK AWAY AND
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.890
OR, YOU CAN BE
PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER.

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:48.040
SOMETHING THAT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.770
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO NEED?

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:56.560
A PINT. MAYBE LESS.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.950
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.
IT HAS TO BE AN OFFERING.

01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:03.740
AND AFTERWARD?

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:09.820
EVERYTHING I PROMISED. AND MORE.

01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.380
THE MONEY WON'T EVEN COMPARE.
