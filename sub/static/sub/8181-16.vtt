WEBVTT

00:06.522 --> 00:08.689
FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T
SEE HIS OWN REFLECTION,

00:08.757 --> 00:11.526
DRACULA IS
PRETTY WELL GROOMED.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.861
LET'S SEE
WHAT ELSE IS ON.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.365
OH, LEAVE THAT.

00:17.433 --> 00:19.100
MR. PRIME MINISTER,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:19.168 --> 00:20.301
CHARLIE ROSE?

00:20.369 --> 00:22.787
YOU REALIZE THAT'S PBS.

00:22.855 --> 00:27.008
DOUG, WE NEVER WATCH ANYTHING
THAT BROADENS OUR HORIZONS.

00:27.076 --> 00:29.528
MAYBE THIS WILL GIVE US
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

00:29.595 --> 00:31.930
WE WATCH TV SO
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

00:31.997 --> 00:34.265
LET'S JUST TRY IT.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.067
...HE
FINDS HIMSELF IN THE CENTER

00:36.135 --> 00:37.302
OF TODAY'S
MOST PRESSING ISSUES-

00:37.370 --> 00:39.371
THE WAR ON TERROR,
FUTURE SHAPE OF EUROPE-

00:39.438 --> 00:41.039
WHO'S HE INTERVIEWING?

00:41.107 --> 00:45.310
IT SAYS RIGHT THERE,
THE PRIME MINISTER OF TURKEY.

00:45.377 --> 00:48.596
I GOTTA LEVEL WITH YOU. I'D RATHER
SEE AN INTERVIEW WITH AN ACTUAL TURKEY.

00:48.664 --> 00:49.948
ALL RIGHT. SHH!

00:50.015 --> 00:53.685
TELL ME WHAT ROLE
YOU THINK TURKEY CAN PLAY

00:53.752 --> 00:55.220
IN SHAPING-

00:55.288 --> 00:57.322
BET YOU 5 BUCKS CHARLIE
PICKS UP HIS WATER GLASS

00:57.390 --> 00:58.623
IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS.

00:58.691 --> 00:59.624
COME ON.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.959
I'LL GIVE YOU 3-TO-1 ODDS.

01:01.026 --> 01:03.778
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON. OKAY.

01:03.846 --> 01:07.431
COME ON. YOU'RE BORED
AND THIRSTY, CHARLIE.

01:07.499 --> 01:09.768
COME ON,
PICK IT UP, BUDDY.

01:09.835 --> 01:11.302
COME ON, PICK IT UP.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.804
CHARLIE,
DON'T DO IT, DON'T DO IT!

01:12.872 --> 01:15.039
TAKE A SIP.
HEY, SIPSY RUSSELL!

01:17.676 --> 01:20.495
<i>WANT TO GO DOUBLE OR NOTHING
ON MASTERPIECE THEATER?</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.985 --> 02:01.569
AH, DOUGLAS.

02:01.637 --> 02:05.206
WHAT IS THAT
POWERFUL AROMA?

02:05.274 --> 02:08.675
I COULD ASK
THE SAME THING.

02:08.744 --> 02:11.912
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF MELTED SANDWICH?

02:11.980 --> 02:14.249
YES, IT IS, AND I DON'T
WANT YOU SHEDDING ON IT,

02:14.316 --> 02:15.250
SO COULD YOU
STEP BACK?

02:15.317 --> 02:17.452
SO, I CAN'T BE NEAR
YOUR FOOD.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.853
THEN I ASSUME
YOU'D REALLY GET UPSET

02:18.921 --> 02:21.555
IF I TOUCHED IT
LIKE THIS, HUH?

02:21.623 --> 02:23.992
ACTUALLY, ALL YOU DID
WAS TOUCH HOT BUTTER.

02:24.059 --> 02:26.961
EXCUSE ME.
I NEED SOME SALVE.

02:28.497 --> 02:30.198
OH, HEY.

02:30.265 --> 02:31.933
DID YOU GET FITTED
FOR YOUR SUIT

02:32.001 --> 02:33.184
FOR MY COUSIN FAYE'S
WEDDING?

02:33.252 --> 02:35.536
NO, BUT IT'S RIGHT AT
THE TOP OF MY TO-DO LIST.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.371
HONEY, YOU UNDERSTAND
THE WEDDING IS IN 2 WEEKS,

02:37.439 --> 02:39.808
AND YOU ARE A GUY WHO NEEDS
A TAILOR'S HELP.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.175
OK, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE CONCEPT

02:41.243 --> 02:43.011
BEHIND A GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICH?

02:43.079 --> 02:45.546
IF THE CHEESE COOLS,
THIS WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.

02:45.615 --> 02:48.449
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS GET THE SUIT!

02:48.517 --> 02:51.052
AND ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS SHUTTY.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.253
OHH!

02:55.541 --> 02:56.324
DOUG!

02:56.391 --> 02:57.808
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU OK?

02:59.711 --> 03:01.346
CHEESE STILL HOT.

03:02.431 --> 03:04.949
OK, TRY TO KEEP THE WEIGHT
ON THE OTHER FOOT.

03:05.017 --> 03:08.053
LET'S PLANT YOU
ON THE COUCH.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.554
I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU
TO DO THAT.

03:09.621 --> 03:13.024
ALL RIGHT,
REMEMBER THE DOCTOR SAID

03:13.092 --> 03:14.526
TO KEEP YOUR FOOT
ELEVATED,

03:14.593 --> 03:17.195
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR PILLS EVERY 3 HOURS.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.197
NEXT ONE'S AT 4:00.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.932
DID HE HAPPEN TO MENTION
WHAT TIME

03:21.000 --> 03:22.133
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY

03:22.201 --> 03:24.102
FOR PUSHING ME
DOWN THE STAIRS!

03:24.169 --> 03:26.237
I DIDN'T PUSH YOU.
YOU FELL.

03:26.305 --> 03:27.438
BECAUSE YOU HIT ME!

03:27.506 --> 03:29.407
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET FITTED
FOR YOUR SUIT LIKE I ASKED YOU TO!

03:29.475 --> 03:31.375
SO YOU CRIPPLE ME?

03:31.443 --> 03:33.661
<i>AND FOR THE TIME YOU
RIPPED UP MY VOGUE MAGAZINE</i>

03:33.729 --> 03:36.030
'CAUSE YOU HAD TO MAKE
YOUR COLLAGE.

03:36.098 --> 03:37.549
IT WASN'T A COLLAGE.

03:37.616 --> 03:39.050
I WAS CONSTRUCTING
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

03:39.117 --> 03:40.718
OK...

03:40.786 --> 03:45.039
ANYWAY, THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU'RE NOT CRIPPLED.

03:45.107 --> 03:47.441
WITH A MONTH OF PHYSICAL
THERAPY, YOU'LL BE FINE.

03:47.509 --> 03:48.460
OH, JUST A MONTH...

03:48.527 --> 03:52.296
AND EVERY DAY IT RAINS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

03:55.434 --> 03:57.902
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET, OK?

03:57.970 --> 04:01.172
BUT YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT I
DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU, RIGHT?

04:01.240 --> 04:03.424
I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.318
WHAT?

04:13.385 --> 04:14.785
I JUST CAME UP
FOR A GLASS OF WATER.

04:14.853 --> 04:15.820
I DON'T
WANT ANY TROUBLE.

04:15.887 --> 04:17.755
COME ON, DAD.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

04:17.822 --> 04:18.740
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

04:18.807 --> 04:20.757
WITH HIM BEING
BASICALLY UNINSURABLE,

04:20.826 --> 04:23.094
WHERE WOULD THAT LEAVE US?

04:23.162 --> 04:25.497
ALL RIGHT,
WOULD YOU BACK OFF?

04:25.564 --> 04:26.731
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

04:26.798 --> 04:28.466
SHAME ON YOU, CARRIE.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.952
I'VE PUSHED MANY PEOPLE
DOWN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS,

04:31.020 --> 04:34.388
BUT DAMN IT, I'VE ALWAYS OWNED UP TO IT.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.997
OK, PHYSICAL THERAPY'S
ON THE 2nd FLOOR.

05:00.065 --> 05:01.816
OH, THE SNACK BAR'S
ON THE 5th FLOOR.

05:01.883 --> 05:03.651
THIS DAY JUST
KEEPS GETTING BETTER.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.838
WHAT THE HELL?

05:09.691 --> 05:12.093
THAT IS SICK!

05:14.646 --> 05:16.013
HEY, EXCUSE ME,

05:16.081 --> 05:17.348
WHAT'S THAT?

05:17.416 --> 05:20.818
THAT RIGHT THERE IS A LITTLE
THING CALLED "SLAMBALL."

05:20.886 --> 05:22.303
GREAT, ANOTHER COOL THING WE CAN'T DO

05:22.371 --> 05:23.922
BECAUSE OF CARRIE.

05:23.989 --> 05:25.990
YEAH, WE CAN'T...

05:26.058 --> 05:27.758
<i>WE CAN.</i>

05:27.826 --> 05:28.910
HEY, PUT US
DOWN FOR TOMORROW.

05:28.978 --> 05:31.045
HEFFERNAN. H-E-F-F-

05:31.113 --> 05:32.847
WHOA. DON'T GET AHEAD
OF YOURSELF, CHIEF.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.548
WE GOT
A 3-MONTH WAITING LIST.

05:34.616 --> 05:37.652
HEY!
YOU CAN'T TOUCH HIM THERE.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.049
HAVE YOU
CHANGED YOUR PANTS

05:51.117 --> 05:54.385
SINCE YOU FELL
DOWN THE STAIRS?

05:54.453 --> 05:56.687
IT'S A WHOLE THING
GETTING THEM OFF.

05:56.756 --> 05:57.989
JUST...

05:58.057 --> 05:59.874
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, CARRIE.

05:59.942 --> 06:01.909
HOW'D YOUR
PHYSICAL THERAPY GO?

06:01.977 --> 06:03.177
PRETTY ROUGH.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.064
WORKED SOME DEEP TISSUE
ON MY THIGH

06:06.131 --> 06:08.466
WHILE I WENT
TO MY SAFE PLACE.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.668
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY,

06:10.736 --> 06:12.971
SO I GOT YOU SOME BURGERS
FROM WHITE CASTLE.

06:13.038 --> 06:14.472
OH, THANK YOU.

06:14.539 --> 06:16.507
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE
THE FRIES

06:16.575 --> 06:17.675
FROM
THE BOWLING ALLEY,

06:17.743 --> 06:19.210
SO THERE YOU GO.

06:19.277 --> 06:20.377
GREAT.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.714
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH A SODA.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.817
I GOT TO TELL YOU-

06:25.885 --> 06:27.118
I FEEL LIKE GOING HOME
AND HAVING KELLY

06:27.186 --> 06:28.953
PUSH ME DOWN SOME STAIRS.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.272
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:31.340 --> 06:32.973
I'VE NEVER SEEN CARRIE
SERVE YOU.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.376
OR SMILE AT YOU.

06:35.444 --> 06:37.128
SHE'S JUST
ACTING ALL NICE.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.562
I BET SHE FEELS GUILTY.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.164
NO, IT'S MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.799
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.

06:41.866 --> 06:45.303
THE WHOLE BALANCE OF POWER
HAS SHIFTED TO YOU.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.005
GET OUT OF HERE.

06:47.072 --> 06:48.606
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
THAT THING ON YOUR LEG,

06:48.674 --> 06:50.741
I BET YOU GET
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

06:50.809 --> 06:53.878
HERE YOU GO.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.546
YOU ALL SET?

06:55.614 --> 06:58.432
UM... ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

06:58.500 --> 07:01.402
COULD YOU JUST TAKE
THE PICKLES OFF THE BURGERS?

07:01.469 --> 07:02.737
SURE.

07:02.804 --> 07:05.205
AND THEN CHOP THEM UP
INTO LITTLE BITS,

07:05.273 --> 07:07.708
AND THEN PUT THEM
BACK ON LIKE RELISH?

07:09.594 --> 07:10.862
I WASN'T KIDDING.

07:10.929 --> 07:12.197
OH, OK.

07:43.912 --> 07:46.514
WHAT'S UP?

07:54.089 --> 07:55.423
WELL,
THE SWELLING'S GONE,

07:55.491 --> 07:57.858
AND YOU'VE GOT
FULL MOBILITY BACK.

07:57.926 --> 08:00.244
OH... WHAT?

08:00.312 --> 08:02.113
IT WASN'T AS BAD
AS WE THOUGHT.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.214
YOU'RE 100 PERCENT.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.934
OK, THAT IS
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

08:07.002 --> 08:09.704
I'M GOING TO NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER.

08:09.772 --> 08:12.573
UM, YOU CAN PAY
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

08:12.641 --> 08:15.142
I WAS PROMISED A MONTH
OF PAIN AND DISCOMFORT.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.844
I WAS PROMISED A MONTH.
A MONTH!

08:16.912 --> 08:17.978
COME ON, MAN.

08:18.046 --> 08:19.447
YOU HAD
A HELL OF A RIDE.

08:20.866 --> 08:22.400
OH, GOD...

08:22.467 --> 08:24.269
NOW I GOT TO GO TO HER
COUSIN'S WEDDING ON SATURDAY.

08:24.336 --> 08:26.137
SO? IT'S JUST A WEDDING.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.805
IT'S A WICCAN WEDDING!

08:27.873 --> 08:30.074
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

08:30.142 --> 08:31.525
THEY'RE WITCHES.

08:31.593 --> 08:35.162
AND NOT HOT WITCHES
LIKE TABITHA OR SABRINA.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.081
IT'S GOING TO BE
A NIGHTMARE.

08:37.148 --> 08:38.515
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO?

08:38.583 --> 08:41.818
I GOT TO KEEP
THIS THING GOING.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.821
HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:43.889 --> 08:45.957
HOBBLE ME.

08:47.859 --> 08:50.227
HOW AM I GOING
TO HOBBLE YOU WITH THIS?

08:50.295 --> 08:51.228
JUST DO IT.

08:51.296 --> 08:52.897
NO!

08:52.965 --> 08:55.066
FINE. THEN I'LL DO IT,
ALL RIGHT?

08:56.468 --> 08:57.969
HERE...

09:02.307 --> 09:03.874
COWARD!

09:13.319 --> 09:14.418
UGH!

09:16.037 --> 09:17.705
DOUG, IS THAT YOU?

09:17.773 --> 09:19.157
YEAH, BE RIGHT UP.

09:21.176 --> 09:22.610
ARE YOU OK?

09:22.678 --> 09:24.312
OH, YEAH. I'M... FINE.

09:24.379 --> 09:26.180
WHAT HAPPENED? I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GETTING BETTER.

09:26.248 --> 09:27.181
I WAS.

09:27.249 --> 09:29.149
I WAS AT
PHYSICAL THERAPY TODAY,

09:29.218 --> 09:30.751
AND I TOLD THE GUY
TO REALLY TEST ME,

09:30.819 --> 09:32.687
AND IT FELT GOOD
FOR A WHILE,

09:32.754 --> 09:34.288
BUT THEN I HEARD
THIS SOUND.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.556
IT WAS LIKE A...

09:35.624 --> 09:37.642
A SNAP...

09:37.709 --> 09:39.944
CRACKLE... SOUND.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.379
HONEY, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE PUSHED IT.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.749
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT I, UH...

09:44.817 --> 09:47.084
AH, NEVER MIND.
IT'S... IT'S STUPID.

09:47.152 --> 09:49.219
WHAT? TELL ME.

09:52.173 --> 09:54.475
I REALLY WANTED
TO DANCE WITH YOU

09:54.543 --> 09:57.712
AT YOUR COUSIN'S WEDDING,
YOU KNOW?

09:57.779 --> 10:00.615
OUTSIDE, UNDER THE STARS.

10:00.682 --> 10:04.218
OH, BABY.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

10:04.286 --> 10:06.153
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO THE WEDDING.

10:06.221 --> 10:07.455
I'M NOT GOING TO RISK

10:07.522 --> 10:09.457
HAVING YOU
HURT YOURSELF AGAIN.

10:09.524 --> 10:11.025
I'LL BE FINE. JUST PROP
ME UP AGAINST A TREE.

10:11.092 --> 10:12.026
I AM GOING!

10:12.093 --> 10:13.027
OH, GOD!

10:13.094 --> 10:14.695
BABY! OH, MY-

10:14.763 --> 10:16.196
OH, GOD! OH!

10:16.264 --> 10:18.399
ARE YOU OK?
HERE, LET'S GET YOU-

10:18.467 --> 10:19.700
OH, GOD!

10:19.768 --> 10:21.469
YOU DON'T GET CUTE
WITH A KNEE.

10:21.536 --> 10:22.936
I KNOW THAT NOW.

10:23.004 --> 10:25.522
OH, SWEETHEART.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.523
MMM...

10:26.591 --> 10:29.160
LISTEN, IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

10:29.228 --> 10:30.627
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

10:32.247 --> 10:35.048
ACTUALLY...

10:35.116 --> 10:37.985
THERE'S LIKE 3 LEFTOVER
WHITE CASTLE DOWNSTAIRS.

10:40.138 --> 10:42.356
CAN YOU RE-HEAT THEM?

10:43.342 --> 10:46.009
YES, YES.
THANKS.

10:49.998 --> 10:52.566
DOUG, PLEASE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CARRY MY BAG.

10:52.634 --> 10:54.568
I WANT TO SEE
MY BABY OFF.

10:54.636 --> 10:57.238
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GET IT.

10:57.305 --> 11:00.441
NO, I GOT IT!
I HAVE TO LEARN, OK!

11:04.379 --> 11:06.380
OK, BABY.
AND THANK YOU.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.381
I GOT IT.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.049
ALL RIGHT.

11:09.117 --> 11:11.452
DEACON, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE WITH HIM, RIGHT?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.621
DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GET HIM
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

11:13.689 --> 11:15.673
OK. THANK YOU.

11:15.741 --> 11:16.441
BYE, HONEY.

11:16.508 --> 11:18.125
ALL RIGHT.

11:22.464 --> 11:23.797
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU TOLD HER,

11:23.865 --> 11:26.367
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
A SPONGE BATH.

11:26.434 --> 11:29.720
HOW ABOUT JUST A SHAMPOO?

11:29.788 --> 11:30.904
YOU ARE SUCH A WUSS.

11:30.972 --> 11:33.006
THIS GUY
JUST BOUGHT A STUN GUN.

11:33.074 --> 11:34.742
I WORK IN THE SUBWAY.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.243
I NEED THIS
FOR PROTECTION.

11:36.311 --> 11:37.111
ACTUALLY,
IN HIS DEFENSE,

11:37.178 --> 11:38.846
HE HAS BEEN BEATEN,
SET ON FIRE,

11:38.914 --> 11:40.280
AND VIOLATED TWICE.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.900
ANYWAY,
THAT LITTLE STUN GUN

11:42.968 --> 11:44.585
IS NOT GOING
TO STOP ANYONE.

11:44.653 --> 11:47.238
REALLY? WHY DON'T I
TRY IT OUT ON YOU?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.506
MAKE IT WORTH MY WHILE.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.291
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS.

11:51.359 --> 11:54.562
20 BUCKS... NO, THANKS.

11:54.629 --> 11:55.562
I'LL KICK IN 20.

11:55.630 --> 11:58.299
YEAH, ME, TOO.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.667
BUT YOU CAN'T SCREAM.

11:59.735 --> 12:02.035
OPEN YOUR JACKET.

12:11.780 --> 12:12.780
PAY UP.

12:17.919 --> 12:19.620
I'LL HAVE TO OWE YOU.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.425
OH,
THAT'S YOUR PHONE.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.660
COULD YOU GET IT?

12:25.695 --> 12:26.577
YEAH.

12:28.046 --> 12:29.480
HELLO.

12:29.547 --> 12:31.332
WH-OH, YEAH.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.618
NO, NO, NO
- WE WANT IT, WE'LL TAKE IT.

12:33.685 --> 12:34.986
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.137
GUYS, REMEMBER HOW THE
SLAMBALL COURT WAS BOOKED?

12:37.205 --> 12:38.539
WELL, THERE'S BEEN
A CANCELLATION

12:38.607 --> 12:40.140
AND WE HAVE IT
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

12:41.443 --> 12:42.443
THAT'S AWESOME.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.077
WAIT A SEC.
YOU CAN'T GO.

12:44.145 --> 12:45.078
YOU JUST
CONVINCED CARRIE

12:45.146 --> 12:46.614
YOU HAD
A MAJOR SETBACK.

12:46.681 --> 12:49.450
SO? I'LL JUST GET ALL BETTER
BY SLAMBALL.

12:49.517 --> 12:51.251
YOU'RE GOING TO GO FROM CRIPPLED
TO JUMPING ON A TRAMPOLINE

12:51.319 --> 12:52.252
IN 3 DAYS?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.554
SHE'LL NEVER BUY IT.

12:53.622 --> 12:55.005
HOW ABOUT THIS?

12:55.073 --> 12:56.474
SHE COMES HOME
SUNDAY NIGHT, RIGHT?

12:56.541 --> 12:58.241
I TELL HER
I ICED MY KNEE ALL WEEKEND

12:58.309 --> 12:59.777
AND THE SWELLING WENT DOWN.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.880
MONDAY, I DROP MY CRUTCH
IN FRONT OF HER,

13:02.948 --> 13:03.997
I PUT WEIGHT ON THE KNEE,

13:04.065 --> 13:05.582
IT GOES WELL.

13:05.650 --> 13:08.585
GUYS, I CAN'T SEE
OUT OF MY LEFT EYE.

13:12.057 --> 13:16.277
TUESDAY, MY DOCTOR CALLS,
THE X-RAYS LOOK GOOD.

13:16.344 --> 13:17.978
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
YOUR DOCTOR

13:18.046 --> 13:19.513
TO GO ALONG WITH THIS?

13:19.615 --> 13:22.182
I THINK SO,
BECAUSE MY DOCTOR IS YOU.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.051
OOH! I'M AN ORTHOPEDIST.

13:24.119 --> 13:25.703
THEN, WEDNESDAY MORNING,

13:25.771 --> 13:27.772
I INVITE CARRIE OUT
FOR A WALK.

13:27.839 --> 13:30.157
SHE BECOMES A PARTNER
IN MY RECOVERY,

13:30.225 --> 13:34.294
12 HOURS LATER,
SLAMBALL!

13:43.237 --> 13:45.872
HONEY, I'M HOME!

13:54.516 --> 13:55.449
HEY.

13:55.517 --> 13:56.684
HEY, BABY.

13:56.751 --> 13:59.052
YOU'RE HOME FROM THE
WEDDING EARLY. HOW WAS IT?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.405
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I ENJOYED MORE,

14:01.473 --> 14:03.807
THE MUD DANCING
OR THE ACTUAL CEREMONY,

14:03.875 --> 14:05.276
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE
WAS OFFICIATED

14:05.343 --> 14:06.743
BY A CROW.

14:06.811 --> 14:09.213
OFFICIATED BY A CROW.

14:09.281 --> 14:10.981
ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN ICING
MY KNEE ALL WEEKEND,

14:11.049 --> 14:13.384
AND I THINK
THE SWELLING WENT DOWN.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.569
I THINK I GOT SAP
IN MY HAIR.

14:15.637 --> 14:16.721
OH, GEEZ.

14:16.788 --> 14:19.357
WOW, I GOT
A LITTLE WEIGHT ON HER.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.959
DOESN'T FEEL TOO BAD. ALMOST
A LITTLE BOUNCE ON THERE.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.160
BOUNCY.

14:23.228 --> 14:24.729
THAT'S GREAT, HONEY.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.398
HEY, MAYBE LATER ON
WE'LL GO FOR A WALK.

14:27.466 --> 14:28.565
OK.

14:37.392 --> 14:38.759
ARTHUR,
WHY ARE THE LIGHTS OFF?

14:38.827 --> 14:44.331
YOU'LL SEE ME
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

14:44.399 --> 14:44.998
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:45.066 --> 14:49.002
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT SOME FAMILY PHOTOS.

14:49.070 --> 14:52.539
I THINK CARRIE WILL FIND
THIS ONE INTERESTING.

14:52.607 --> 14:57.211
NO CAST, NO CRUTCHES.

14:57.278 --> 15:00.081
SO WHAT? THAT PICTURE COULD
HAVE BEEN TAKEN A YEAR AGO.

15:00.148 --> 15:05.953
LOOK AT THE COVER
OF THAT MAGAZINE.

15:06.021 --> 15:10.607
IT FEATURES A CLEARLY
PREGNANT KATIE HOLMES.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.342
DAMN IT!

15:12.410 --> 15:14.195
AND THE NEXT ONE
WAS TAKEN

15:14.262 --> 15:16.931
BEFORE YESTERDAY'S
KNICKERBOCKER GAME.

15:19.968 --> 15:23.320
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE-

15:23.388 --> 15:25.539
YOU RECEIVING THE NEWS
ABOUT THE RETURN

15:25.607 --> 15:28.041
OF THE McRIB SANDWICH.

15:30.795 --> 15:33.331
TURN IT OFF.

15:33.398 --> 15:34.915
TURN IT OFF!

15:37.985 --> 15:39.453
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
OLD MAN?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.422
I WANT WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

15:41.489 --> 15:42.623
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:42.690 --> 15:43.958
I'M TALKING ABOUT POWER.

15:44.025 --> 15:46.259
FROM NOW ON, I'M GETTING
EVERYTHING I WANT FROM CARRIE

15:46.327 --> 15:47.394
THROUGH YOU!

15:48.362 --> 15:49.380
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

15:49.447 --> 15:50.581
I'M TAKING THIS.

15:50.648 --> 15:52.416
THE NEGATIVES
ARE IN A LOCKER

15:52.484 --> 15:55.402
AT THE STATEN ISLAND Y.

15:57.438 --> 15:58.438
HEY, HONEY?

15:58.506 --> 16:01.375
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT FOR DINNER?

16:02.610 --> 16:04.277
LIVER AND ONIONS.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.446
OH, NO, NO, NO-

16:06.514 --> 16:08.032
LIVER AND ONIONS.
SAY IT.

16:10.268 --> 16:13.370
LIVER AND ONIONS.

16:13.438 --> 16:16.340
REALLY? OK.

16:22.747 --> 16:25.065
YO, SLAMBALL TIME.

16:25.133 --> 16:26.366
I CAN'T GO.

16:26.434 --> 16:28.535
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE 3-DAY PLAN?

16:28.603 --> 16:30.321
IT WAS GOING GREAT
UNTIL ARTHUR FOUND OUT.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.855
NOW HE'S BLACKMAILING ME,

16:31.923 --> 16:33.690
SO I GOT TO KEEP
PRETENDING I'M HURT.

16:33.758 --> 16:34.975
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

16:35.042 --> 16:37.244
HE'S MAKING ME SORT OUT
HIS DIRTY PLAYING CARDS...

16:37.312 --> 16:39.913
BY CUP SIZE.

16:39.981 --> 16:43.917
THAT ONE BELONGS
IN ITS OWN PILE.

16:43.985 --> 16:45.853
COME ON, MAN.
WE NEED 4 GUYS.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.755
DOUGLAS,
STOP DILLY-DALLYING.

16:47.823 --> 16:48.989
I'VE HAD SOME DRAMBUIE

16:49.057 --> 16:51.224
AND I WANT TO PLAY
SOLITAIRE.

16:54.162 --> 16:55.663
LET'S DO THIS.
I'M DOIN' IT.

16:55.730 --> 16:56.897
YOU SURE?

16:56.965 --> 16:59.099
I'LL JUST TELL CARRIE
I'M GOING TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.334
WHAT ABOUT ARTHUR?

17:00.401 --> 17:02.703
GIVE ME 10 MINUTES.

17:05.873 --> 17:07.407
HOW'S THE BORSCHT?

17:07.474 --> 17:09.643
FIRST-RATE.

17:09.711 --> 17:12.162
SHAME CARRIE HAD TO GO
ALL THE WAY TO YONKERS

17:12.230 --> 17:16.133
TO GET IT FOR "YOU."

17:16.200 --> 17:17.701
YEAH, IT'S TOO BAD.

17:19.203 --> 17:23.156
STRANGE... I FEEL
A BIT LIGHT-HEADED.

17:25.059 --> 17:26.893
THAT'S FUNNY.
WHAT DO I HAVE HERE?

17:26.961 --> 17:32.382
OH, THE SLEEPING PILLS
THAT CARRIE GOT FOR "ME."

17:35.870 --> 17:39.606
I MUST SAY, YOU PLAYED THE
PART OF THE LUMBERING IMBECILE

17:39.674 --> 17:41.475
QUITE WELL.

17:41.576 --> 17:43.944
WELL, THANK YOU.
AND WHEN YOU START TO DROOL,

17:44.012 --> 17:45.445
KEEP IT IN THE BOWL.

17:53.321 --> 17:54.287
GIVE ME THE BALL.

17:54.355 --> 17:56.273
I'M OPEN!

18:04.716 --> 18:07.284
HI,
I'M CARRIE HEFFERNAN.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.485
OH, YOU'RE DOUG'S WIFE.

18:08.553 --> 18:11.087
YES. MY FATHER
WROTE ME THIS NOTE

18:11.155 --> 18:12.889
BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP.

18:12.957 --> 18:14.258
"HELP... DOUG."

18:14.326 --> 18:16.109
HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH YOU TODAY.

18:16.177 --> 18:17.661
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

18:17.728 --> 18:18.546
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN 2 WEEKS,

18:18.613 --> 18:19.813
EVER SINCE HIS KNEE
WAS BETTER.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.883
BETTER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE HAD A HUGE SETBACK.

18:22.951 --> 18:25.786
HE DID?
WELL, HAVE HIM CALL ME.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.397
YEAH! WHOO!

18:37.465 --> 18:39.683
WHOO-HOO-HOO-YEOW!

18:39.750 --> 18:40.884
YEAH!

18:44.606 --> 18:46.890
HEY... CAR.

18:46.958 --> 18:49.259
KIND OF
CRAZY THERAPY, HUH?

18:49.327 --> 18:52.112
YOU'VE BEEN FAKING
THIS WHOLE TIME?

18:52.180 --> 18:54.498
NO,
NOT THE WHOLE TIME.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.949
GET OFF OF THERE.

18:56.017 --> 18:57.034
NO.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.169
DOUG, DON'T BOUNCE
AWAY FROM ME.

19:00.955 --> 19:03.623
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU PUT ME THROUGH? HUH?

19:03.691 --> 19:05.792
ALL THE THINGS
YOU MADE ME DO FOR YOU.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.895
SOME THINGS
I CAN'T EVEN MENTION.

19:08.963 --> 19:10.330
YOU MADE ME FEEL
SO GUILTY

19:10.398 --> 19:11.465
THAT I'VE BEEN
ACTUALLY LISTENING

19:11.532 --> 19:13.567
TO ANGER MANAGEMENT
TAPES.

19:13.635 --> 19:15.202
YOU MAY WANT
TO POP ONE IN NOW.

19:15.270 --> 19:16.803
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

19:16.871 --> 19:18.538
LET ME TELL YOU SOME-

19:18.606 --> 19:20.240
DOUG... OK.

19:20.307 --> 19:22.175
DOUG...

19:25.113 --> 19:25.963
YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?

19:26.031 --> 19:27.748
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS!

19:27.816 --> 19:28.982
I'M SORRY, OK?

19:29.050 --> 19:31.401
OH, YOU'RE SORRY.
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

19:34.940 --> 19:36.823
YEAH. IT'S FUN, RIGHT?

19:36.891 --> 19:38.826
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU.

19:38.893 --> 19:39.693
TRY THE SIT DOWN.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.778
I DON'T WANT TO.

19:40.845 --> 19:42.045
WHOO!

19:42.113 --> 19:43.263
GIVE IT A SHOT.

19:43.331 --> 19:44.798
COME ON.

19:44.866 --> 19:46.666
WHOO!

19:46.734 --> 19:49.419
THERE YOU GO!
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

19:49.487 --> 19:50.303
BOUNCE IT OUT.

19:50.371 --> 19:51.438
GO HIGHER.

19:51.506 --> 19:52.756
I DON'T WANT TO.
I'M SCARED.

19:52.823 --> 19:53.957
YOU DO IT, HONEY.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.492
OK, WATCH ME.

19:55.510 --> 19:57.461
GO HIGHER, BABY.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.846
HIGHER, BABY.
COME ON, HIGHER!

19:58.913 --> 19:59.963
HIGHER!

20:00.865 --> 20:01.915
OHH!

20:21.519 --> 20:23.103
I GOT DANNY.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.139
I'LL TAKE CARRIE.

20:27.608 --> 20:28.541
I GOT ARTHUR.

20:35.216 --> 20:37.150
UM...

20:38.970 --> 20:40.971
COME ON!

20:41.990 --> 20:43.340
ALL RIGHT.
