17:51.240 --> 17:53.550
And a few more of those who pull us down

17:53.640 --> 17:56.314
from our flights of fancy back to Earth.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.993
Hmm.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.878
Who at Hilltop will be that for Henry?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.310
I have some ideas.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.918
I'm sure you do, my queen.
I'm sure you do.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.950
Gabriel: As you can probably
tell from our turnout here,

18:16.040 --> 18:17.474
it's been a long time since we've seen

18:17.560 --> 18:20.518
new faces inside these walls.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.240
We're a fair community
of decent-minded people,

18:23.320 --> 18:27.996
but we are not soft.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.310
And that's not going to change today.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.472
So let's begin.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.313
Which one of you is the leader?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.837
What makes you think we have one?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.270
- Did you know each other before?
- Luke: No.

18:45.360 --> 18:50.070
It was, uh, Magna and then
Yumiko, uh, first,

18:50.160 --> 18:55.234
and then, uh, Connie and Kelly

18:55.360 --> 18:58.671
and then-- and then me

18:58.760 --> 19:00.353
and then Bernie.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.398
[Inhales deeply] Sh--

19:03.480 --> 19:05.517
[Sighs]

19:05.600 --> 19:07.557
I'm sorry.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.393
[Exhales sharply] Bernie was
the one that we lost yesterday.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.194
Um...

19:15.280 --> 19:16.475
[Sighs]

19:18.760 --> 19:21.479
There were others, of course.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.279
[Sighs]

19:24.360 --> 19:26.636
But, like Bernie, they just...

19:30.000 --> 19:31.991
[crying]

19:34.520 --> 19:37.717
They didn't, uh-- they didn't make it.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.320
Who were you before?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.630
Me? Before all this?

19:44.720 --> 19:45.994
[Claps hands softly]

19:46.120 --> 19:49.670
[Sighs] I was a music teacher.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.434
Waited tables at a truck stop.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.073
She says she was a journalist,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.834
but she's just being modest.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.799
She exposed a bunch
of sleazeball politicians

20:04.880 --> 20:07.315
and put them behind bars.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.195
And you?

20:10.280 --> 20:12.920
I was in high school,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.593
stressin' about stupid shit

20:14.680 --> 20:16.159
that felt like the end of the world.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.111
And who are you now?

20:22.760 --> 20:24.751
A fighter.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.560
She says she's my guardian angel,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.359
but, really, it's the other way around.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.399
I guess I'm still a music teacher?

20:37.480 --> 20:41.360
Um, education never ends,

20:41.440 --> 20:45.798
not even in the face
of monsters and mayhem.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.954
What did you do to survive?

20:53.040 --> 20:57.477
What I had to-- anything I had to.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.156
She says she never gave up,

21:04.280 --> 21:06.556
but me, I grew up.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.798
Luke: [Exhales sharply]
I don't-- I don't--

21:09.880 --> 21:11.393
[Stammers]

21:11.480 --> 21:12.709
[Inhales deeply]

21:12.800 --> 21:14.757
I don't think I did anything special.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.953
L-I don't know
what I did to deserve it.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.395
Um...

21:22.480 --> 21:24.391
At-- At first, I was just lucky.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.676
I was-- I was in the right place
at the right time,

21:26.760 --> 21:31.197
and then, uh, I met the right people.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.998
[Chuckles]

21:33.080 --> 21:34.559
H-Here's the thing, is that--

21:34.640 --> 21:37.234
it's funny, but [Sniffs] before all this,

21:37.320 --> 21:39.038
if you saw us all sittin'
at the same table

21:39.120 --> 21:41.589
at, like, a restaurant,
a bar, or something...

21:41.680 --> 21:43.318
[Breathes deeply]

21:43.400 --> 21:46.074
...you'd say to yourself, "Well, hey,

21:46.160 --> 21:48.629
I don't know.
Maybe these people work together?"

21:48.720 --> 21:51.394
[Chuckling]
Because we certainly don't have

21:51.480 --> 21:52.800
anything in common,

21:52.880 --> 21:55.633
except for the fact
that we're breathing.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.557
And that's a lot nowadays, right?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.869
Thank you.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.119
If that's everything,
I'd like to motion for a vote.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.713
I have a question.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.599
Gabriel: The chair recognizes
our fellow councilperson

22:19.680 --> 22:21.591
and head of security.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.954
[Chair scrapes]

22:25.560 --> 22:29.554
As a community, we want to be kind.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.679
We want to be generous.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.751
We want to be charitable.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.469
But, as we know,

22:40.560 --> 22:42.676
decisions like the one
we are about to make

22:42.760 --> 22:45.957
can come with a heavy price.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.112
Can you show me your left hand?

23:01.320 --> 23:03.834
Michonne, what are you doing?

23:09.240 --> 23:11.231
[Glove thuds]

23:13.240 --> 23:15.072
You get that at a truck stop?

23:16.800 --> 23:18.837
Screw you.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.951
What is it?

23:24.040 --> 23:26.190
You wanna tell him?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.116
- Michonne, if you have something to say--
- It's a prison tattoo.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.395
[Spectators gasp, murmur]

23:32.480 --> 23:34.949
The four dots are the walls.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.396
The one in the middle is you,

23:38.520 --> 23:41.114
the prisoner.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.793
Hard time.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.394
[Spectators murmuring]

23:48.600 --> 23:49.999
Look, just because she was a prisoner--

23:50.080 --> 23:51.309
I can explain.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.152
Oh, you wanna tell the truth?

23:53.240 --> 23:54.560
Yes.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.517
- And you have nothing to hide?
- Nothing.

Put the knife on the table.

[Spectators gasp]

24:25.080 --> 24:27.594
I remember,

24:27.680 --> 24:29.591
and I know that you do, too.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.997
So go ahead. Take your vote.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.594
I second the motion.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.035
Magna: Hey!

24:41.120 --> 24:42.679
Can I ask you a question?

24:42.760 --> 24:45.036
Michonne: No.

on that thing.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.594
I did.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.636
[Switches clicking, crackling stops]

25:26.720 --> 25:29.439
I just-- I keep thinking

25:29.520 --> 25:31.397
that there are still people out there,

25:31.480 --> 25:32.834
people that we don't know about.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.560
Those survivors?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.313
I think Michonne's wrong.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.720
I think they're good people.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.677
Yeah, I mean, prison doesn't mean shit

25:40.760 --> 25:43.434
without knowing the whole story,
and Michonne knows it.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.837
She just got that crowd
riled up on purpose

25:46.920 --> 25:48.672
ever since, you know...

25:48.760 --> 25:50.876
Yeah, I know.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.553
But they're here.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.869
They're here
until the one in the infirmary

25:53.960 --> 25:55.359
is back on her feet.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.590
So there's still time
for her to change her mind.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.949
Maybe.

[Chuckles]

26:05.480 --> 26:09.030
I was talking to Eugene.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.715
He thinks that if we went
further out...

26:12.840 --> 26:14.035
Mm-hmm.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.270
...and set up a remote amplifier,

26:16.360 --> 26:19.876
we could boost the signal.

what Michonne's gonna say.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.158

Plus, trying to find people

26:27.680 --> 26:28.909
and reach out to them with that thing,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.469
it's like stumbling around in the dark.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.519
But think what we might find,
who we might find,

26:35.600 --> 26:37.511
what else might be out there.

how amazing you are?

Yes.

and never hearing you answer.

to protect him...

27:40.040 --> 27:43.158
...how nothing else mattered
except him...

to be that now for them.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.794
Yeah?

49:16.560 --> 49:18.870
I'm sorry about what I said last night.

49:18.960 --> 49:21.349
And thank you.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.076
It's okay.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.629
You're safe, and that's all that matters.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.871
[Smooches]

49:39.320 --> 49:41.311
Where are you taking us?

49:41.400 --> 49:43.516
Seems like we've gone
clear off the map.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.113
You keep your eyes
on the road, mister.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.599
I know where I'm going.

49:46.680 --> 49:47.829
I know, but--

49:47.960 --> 49:51.430
Whoa.

49:56.840 --> 49:58.433
Need a ride, stranger?

Man: [Sighs]

51:03.720 --> 51:05.518
Sorry, guys. [Grunts]

51:05.600 --> 51:07.238
If I knew we were gonna be
booted as soon as I recovered,

51:07.320 --> 51:09.675
I would've hit my head a bit harder.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.115
You know, it's not too late.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.915
Luke: Doc.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.038
Thank you.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.312
Change of plans.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.231
There's a place a lot like this one.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.630
The leader might take you in.

52:03.720 --> 52:07.839
I'll escort you personally, talk to her.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.719
You're gonna take them to Hilltop?

52:10.800 --> 52:12.518
With you.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.513
You gotta keep an eye on your
patient till we get there.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.158
Good luck.

52:32.840 --> 52:35.354
[Chuckles]

52:35.440 --> 52:37.397
I'll work on it.
