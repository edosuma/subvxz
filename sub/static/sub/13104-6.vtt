00:03.430 --> 00:05.068
1 1/4 CUP, RIGHT?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.294
HAS TO BE EXACT.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.900
CAKE'S ON FIRE.
WHAT?

00:08.940 --> 00:10.202
NO!
(utenSII clatters)

00:10.240 --> 00:11.832
OH, NO, NO, NO!

00:11.870 --> 00:13.531
(sizzling)

00:13.580 --> 00:17.038
IT'S OKAY. I CAN SALVAGE IT.
IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.002
(extinguisher whooshes)

00:19.050 --> 00:20.369
I... (sighs)

00:20.420 --> 00:21.876

I WOULD HAVE USED IT.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.046
(door closes)

00:23.090 --> 00:24.318
WELL, THAT WAS CLOSE.

***

00:25.590 --> 00:26.909
WHY ARE YOU HAVING
THIS THING AGAIN?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.359
YOU'VE BEEN HERE...
SIX MONTHS?

00:28.390 --> 00:29.926
YEAH, AND I NEVER HAD
A HOUSEWARMING,

00:29.960 --> 00:32.053
AND I THINK NOW IS THE TIME
TO SAY I AM FINALLY HOME.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.159
OH.

IT'S FOR TOMORROW.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.895

YES, I DO WANT THAT.

00:35.930 --> 00:36.965
YOU WANT IT?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.297
YOU WANT IT?
THAT IS FOR TOMORROW NIGHT!

00:38.330 --> 00:39.888
WANT THAT?
OOH!

00:39.940 --> 00:41.362

00:41.400 --> 00:43.868
WHAT, YOU WANNA PLAY?
HUH?

00:43.910 --> 00:46.902

00:49.750 --> 00:51.604
(continues laughing)
(knock on door)

00:51.650 --> 00:54.369
OH, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.057
CLAIRE.
(chuckles) HI.

01:02.090 --> 01:04.627
HI.
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:04.660 --> 01:06.321
AND I WANTED TO DROP
SOMETHING OFF,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.726
BUT I-I-I'M INTERRUPTING,
RIGHT?

01:08.760 --> 01:10.728
NO. NO, IT'S FINE.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.237
HMM?
YEAH.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.897
(Claire chuckles)

01:13.940 --> 01:15.430
ARE YOU... HAVING A PARTY?

01:15.470 --> 01:17.267
A HOUSEWARMING, ACTUALLY.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.198
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
LIVING HERE FOR SIX MONTHS?
MM-HMM.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.605
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.200
I-I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.979
CAN I HELP WITH ANYTHING?

01:25.010 --> 01:26.875
NO. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
GONNA PICK UP SOME FOOD

01:26.920 --> 01:29.047
AND FLOWERS AFTER WORK TOMORROW,
BUT I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.685
WELL, I-I CAN DO THAT.
I-I COULD PICK UP FOOD.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.315
I COULD DROP IT HERE
IN THE AFTERNOON.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.555
UH... WELL, I--

01:37.590 --> 01:40.229
ANYWAY... (laughs)
I, UM...

01:40.260 --> 01:43.093
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE THESE.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.166
THEY'RE HOME MOVIES
OF WHEN YOU WERE LI'I'I'LE.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.691
I GOT THEM TRANSFERRED TO DVD.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.367
***

01:49.410 --> 01:51.207
ARE YOU SERIOUS
ABOUT THE FOOD?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.401
OF COURSE.
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.273
UM, IS THERE SOMEONE HERE
TO LET ME IN?

01:56.310 --> 01:59.040
I'M GONNA GET YOU

HERE YOU GO.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.221
(clicks tongue)
UH... (sighs)

02:09.260 --> 02:10.659
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.123
I'VE THROWN DOZENS
OF PARTIES.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.889
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT TO GET.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.295
THANK YOU.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.127
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, SAM.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.660
BYE.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.635
OKAY.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.331
WELL, THAT WAS
VERY HELPFUL OF HER.

02:23.370 --> 02:24.906
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN
BACK IN YOUR LIFE?

02:24.940 --> 02:26.407
MMM... FOUR WEEKS.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.375
OH, GOOD. I THOUGHT
YOU BARELY KNEW EACH OTHER.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.971
(smoke alarm beeping)

02:33.020 --> 02:35.477
OH!

02:38.490 --> 02:40.458
(radio chatter)

02:40.490 --> 02:42.355
(sirens wailing in distance)

02:42.390 --> 02:43.880
INTUBATION.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.886
UH, CORRECT
PATIENT POSITIONING.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.228
UH, DEPRESSION
OF THE PHARYNGEAL REFLEX.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.228
IMMOBILIZATION
OF THE PATIENT.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.238
WELL, ISN'T THAT OBVIOUS?
SO THEN SAY IT.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.760
IMMOBILIZATION
OF THE PATIENT.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.835
VERY GOOD.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.098
YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.

02:56.140 --> 02:58.631
NO, BUT MY DAD IS.
OH, YOU WANT ANOTHER TUTOR?

02:58.670 --> 03:01.104

THIS EXAM.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.404

A CALL.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.408
(thunder rumbling)

03:13.160 --> 03:14.889
(thunder continues rumbling)

03:14.920 --> 03:16.729
VOLUNTARY OVERTIME
AFTER AN ALL-NIGHT SHIFT,

03:16.760 --> 03:18.557
AND YOU DECIDE
TO THROW A PARTY?

03:18.590 --> 03:20.251
HEY, WE CAN SLEEP
WHEN WE'RE DEAD.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.996
LOOK, I NEED THIS.
PROGRESS IS MOVING FORWARD.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.668
ANDY MCNALLY, ZEN MASTER.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.895
NOT REALLY. MORE AVOIDING.
(laughs)

03:26.940 --> 03:28.760
I WISH JERRY WOULD AVOID ME.
WHAT?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.108
I SWEAR, WORKING TOGETHER
AND DATING--

03:30.140 --> 03:31.539
IT'S LIKE I'M HIS MINI-ME.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.208
THE OTHER DAY I ACTUALLY
ANSWERED MY PHONE,

03:33.240 --> 03:34.229
"GO FOR TRACI!"

03:34.280 --> 03:36.373
TRACE.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.378

03:41.750 --> 03:43.286
I'M RUNNING LATE.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.685
(footsteps departing)

03:44.720 --> 03:46.551
OH. DETECTIVE BARBER?

03:46.590 --> 03:48.012
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.221
OUT OF MY FACE, PECK.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.955

LEAVE IT. LEAVE IT.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.966
IT'S JUST SUE CHECKING IN.
I'LL TALK TO HER LATER.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.467

04:00.500 --> 04:01.967
NO, NO. WE'RE GREAT.

MY GYM BAG.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.206
(breathing heavily)

04:10.250 --> 04:12.514
SO E.T.F. AND A UNI--
HOW'S THAT WORK?

04:12.550 --> 04:13.915
SAME AS ANY OTHER
RELATIONSHIP.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.043
(chuckles)
COMPLICATED, HUH?
(chuckles)

04:16.080 --> 04:18.139
WELL, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.
(buckle CIICKS)

04:18.190 --> 04:19.555
THEY ALWAYS GET COMPLICATED.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.012
THAT'S WHY YOU GOTTA
KEEP THINGS LIGHT.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.823
LIKE YOU AND GAIL
KEEPING IT LIGHT?

04:22.860 --> 04:25.181

YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE,

05:13.810 --> 05:16.745
EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.338
LET'S GET TO IT.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.711

05:46.510 --> 05:48.273
WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE
FITTING IT BACK IN THE BOX.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.141
OH, GOOD. SO SHE'LL HAVE
NOTHING TO PUT IT IN

05:50.180 --> 05:53.445
AFTER SHE NEVER USES IT.
(cell phone ringtone playing)

05:53.480 --> 05:57.439

AH. NO, I'M NOT.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.524
IT'S OKAY. YOU NEED
A LITTLE TIME APART,

06:08.560 --> 06:09.959
A LITTLE SPACE.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.365
YEAH. WELL, YOU WOULD KNOW.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.789
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE EXPERT
ON SPACE, RIGHT?

06:13.840 --> 06:17.037
(chuckles) YOU AND NICK.
BUT, UH, TAKE IT FROM ME.

06:17.070 --> 06:18.560
FROM EXPERIENCE?
YEAH?

06:18.610 --> 06:20.737

SOMEBODY USUALLY GETS HURT.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.509
OH, RIGHT.
'CAUSE I'M A WOMAN,

06:22.550 --> 06:24.438
SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE INTERESTED

06:24.480 --> 06:26.846
IN A RELATIONSHIP BASED
SOLELY ON SEX.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.074

YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.946
UH, YES, I CAN TAKE
A MESSAGE.

07:00.980 --> 07:04.586
OKAY, CRYSTAL,
DO YOU HAVE A LAST NAME?

07:04.620 --> 07:06.247
(radio chatter)

07:06.290 --> 07:09.316
UH... YEAH. NO.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.998
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST THING

07:23.040 --> 07:25.702
THIS GUY.
(chuckles) NO.

07:25.740 --> 07:28.800
MY LIFE IS A MESS.
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,

07:28.840 --> 07:30.842
I'M NOT RUNNING AROUND
TRYING TO FIX IT.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.417
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID, UH,
NEAT AND TIDY'S OVERRATED?

07:33.450 --> 07:35.645
YEAH, WELL, I'M PUTTIN'
MY TRUST IN THAT.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.648
EH, NEAT AND TIDY
IS WHO YOU ARE, YOU KNOW?

07:37.690 --> 07:40.158
DON'T DRIVE YOUR TRUST-MOBILE
OFF A CLIFF.

07:40.190 --> 07:43.284
OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO
"DON'T OVERTHINK IT"?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.252
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S OKAY TO BE WARY.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.791
YOU DON'T OWE ANYBODY
ANYTHING.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.119
ANYBODY?
YOU MEAN MY MOTHER?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.421
(siren wailing and passing)

07:51.470 --> 07:53.859
YOU KNOW, I SPENT 15 YEARS
ANALYZING WHY SHE LEFT.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.868
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M SPENDING ANOTHER 15

07:55.900 --> 07:58.539
ANALYZING
WHY SHE CAME BACK.

07:58.570 --> 08:01.004
(female dispatcher) Unit 1505,
call from Matador Alarm Systems.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.545
Silent perimeter alarm received

WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.177
(hangs up receiver)

08:09.220 --> 08:11.438
(siren wailing)

08:11.490 --> 08:14.050
YOU KNOW THE BEST THING
ABOUT SILENT ALARMS?

08:14.090 --> 08:16.979
BELLS ARE RINGING, BUT PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.487

08:41.120 --> 08:44.487
(indistinct conversations)

08:44.520 --> 08:47.353
UHH. IT'S DEFINITELY
A PARTY.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.028
(dance music continues,
indistinct conversations)

08:53.060 --> 08:55.654
IT'S A BUNCH OF KIDS.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.498
(Andy) LOOK OVER THERE.
DEFINITELY WOO-GIRLS.

08:58.530 --> 09:00.532
OH, YEAH? YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE NOT A WOO-GIRL, MCNALLY?

09:00.570 --> 09:02.868
YEAH, MAYBE.
AFTER A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.731
A WHOLE BOTTLE OF TEQUILA,

needle scratch)

09:31.570 --> 09:34.368
YOU GOT TEN MINUTES BEFORE
WE START CALLING YOUR PARENTS!

09:34.400 --> 09:37.631
IF YOU HAVE ALCOHOL
OR ANYTHING ILLEGAL ON YOU,

09:37.670 --> 09:40.275
SET IT DOWN RIGHT NOW
AND HEAD OUT!

09:40.310 --> 09:42.369
(girl screams)

09:42.410 --> 09:43.843
(girl #2) OH, MY GOD!

09:43.880 --> 09:45.370
THAT'S DEFINITELY
NOT A WOO-GIRL.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.549

09:47.580 --> 09:50.686
(radio static)
THIS IS SWAREK.

(radio chatter)
ALL RIGHT, LOCK THIS
PLACE DOWN RIGHT NOW!

09:57.730 --> 10:01.222
NOBODY GOES OUT. ALL THESE KIDS

(radio static)
ALL RIGHT,

10:03.870 --> 10:06.168

Available units in the area...

10:06.200 --> 10:09.192
MOVE AWAY FROM THE EXIT!
LET'S GO!

10:09.240 --> 10:11.629
EVERYBODY,
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE!

10:11.670 --> 10:13.809
I NEED YOU TO STAY
WHERE YOU ARE!

10:13.840 --> 10:16.035

10:18.110 --> 10:20.476
(siren wailing)

10:20.520 --> 10:24.513
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

10:29.290 --> 10:30.928
(siren wailing)

10:30.960 --> 10:32.279
HOW'S THE VICTIM?

10:32.330 --> 10:33.854
COUPLE OF STAB WOUNDS,

10:33.900 --> 10:35.959
AND THE KNIFE
IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.467
YEAH, THE GUY'S UNCONSCIOUS.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.422
UH, PROBABLY HAPPENED
IN THE LAST HOUR.

10:39.470 --> 10:40.994
ANYTHING ON HIM
MIGHT TELL US WHO HE IS?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.166
NO WALLET, NO I.D.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.031
JUST THE CLOTHES ON HIS BACK
AND AN OLD BAG.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.332
COULD HAVE BEEN HOMELESS.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.179
CRASHED HERE,
HARD UP FOR MONEY.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.279
ROBBERY GONE SIDEWAYS.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.073
OKAY, WELL, I'LL, UH,

10:51.350 --> 10:52.942
UH, I'LL TALK TO I.D.E.N.T.

YES, SIR.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.048

(radio chatter continues)

11:02.090 --> 11:03.751
OKAY, AND YOU TWO
STAY WITH THE PARTY KIDS.

11:03.790 --> 11:06.520
I'M SURE SOMEONE
SAW SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.261
(camera shutter clicks,

11:12.470 --> 11:14.097

(camera shutter clicks,
siren wailing)

11:20.410 --> 11:22.071
(wailing continues)

11:22.110 --> 11:24.146
IF JOHN DOE WAKES UP,
TAKE HIS STATEMENT,

11:24.180 --> 11:26.876
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS,
KEEP ME POSTED.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.217

11:36.990 --> 11:39.458
CAN I RID_E WITH _YOU GUYS?
(Siren wailing)

11:39.490 --> 11:42.095
MY SON DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
CAN I TAKE HIM HOME NOW, PLEASE?

11:42.130 --> 11:43.825
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE'RE ALL LOSING SLEEP

11:43.870 --> 11:45.497
OVER SOME HOBO

11:45.530 --> 11:47.031
GOOD QUESTION.

11:47.070 --> 11:49.129
I'LL BE SURE TO EXPLAIN IT YOU
WHEN I TAKE YOUR STATEMENT...

11:49.170 --> 11:51.229

LET GO!
NO!

12:29.440 --> 12:32.238

12:32.280 --> 12:34.544

12:34.580 --> 12:36.013
(radio chatter)

12:36.050 --> 12:37.517
OH, COME ON!

12:37.550 --> 12:40.212
UNCLE SAMMY, PLEASE. MY DAD

12:40.260 --> 12:41.784
"UNCLE SAMMY"?

12:42.860 --> 12:45.420
MCNALLY, IZZY SHAW.

12:45.460 --> 12:49.055

12:54.470 --> 12:56.438
OH, COME ON. I'M BEGGING YOU.
JUST LET ME GO.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.698
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.
YOUR DAD'S HERE.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.469
PLEASE.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.976
PLEASE? IF MY DAD FINDS OUT,
HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

13:04.010 --> 13:07.241
IF HE SEES ME HELPING YOU,
WE ARE BOTH GOING DOWN.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.417

13:12.790 --> 13:14.815

SQUAD CARS?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.589
OKAY? I'LL DISTRACT OLIVER,
YOU GO GET THE KEYS

13:16.620 --> 13:17.928
AND JUST TAKE HER HOME.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.520
YES, AND WHAT DO WE TELL
THE OFFICER SHE ASSAULTED?

13:20.560 --> 13:22.027
IT'S GAIL.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.995
LOOK. GAIL KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A DAUGHTER OF A COP.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.395
YOU DON'T.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.035
SHE'S GONNA WEAR THIS
WAY LONGER THAN IT'S WORTH.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.149
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
IN THERE TONIGHT?

13:38.180 --> 13:40.444
NO. NOTHING. I SWEAR.

OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

JUST DON'T MAKE US
REGRET IT, ALL RIGHT?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.861
MM-HMM.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.707
NOT UNTIL I GET
AN APOLOGY! BLUE!

14:11.750 --> 14:14.071

ON WHAT GROUNDS?

14:56.820 --> 14:59.357
PARENT OF THE YEAR,
ONCE AGAIN.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.759
ON THE GROUNDS THAT
THAT'S MY KID,

15:02.800 --> 15:05.223

15:17.710 --> 15:20.372

15:21.720 --> 15:24.188
SO I'M NOT, LIKE, SERIOUSLY
UNDER ARREST, RIGHT?

15:24.220 --> 15:26.848
(chuckles) NO, BUT I THINK
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY IN TROUBLE.

15:26.890 --> 15:29.017
SAMMY! I GOT THAT INFO
YOU REQUESTED.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.688
OH, UH, COULD YOU HOLD ON
TO THAT FOR ME?

15:31.730 --> 15:33.527
'CAUSE I GOT MY HANDS

AH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL TAKE IT.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.564

OFFICER SWAREK?

15:39.070 --> 15:40.731
(telephone ringing in distance)

15:41.740 --> 15:43.662
YOU'RE LOOKING INTO
MY MOM?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.359
(radio chatter)

15:45.410 --> 15:46.934
YOU WANTED ME
TO GET TO KNOW HER.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.329
YEAH, OKAY.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.904
LET'S GET TO KNOW HER.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.905
CAN I SIT DOWN AT LEAST?

15:54.680 --> 15:56.944
ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT A COUPLE
OF SPEEDING TICKETS HERE.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.287
SHE'S GOT A LEAD FOOT.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.163
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

(inhales)
(pages flip)

16:19.040 --> 16:21.679
SAGITTARIUS.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.404

I NEED SOME AIR.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.099

16:27.980 --> 16:29.345
WOW.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.883
EPIC FAIL, UNCLE SAMMY.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.355
(indistinct conversations)
HEY!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.368

16:46.400 --> 16:48.265
BACKPACK.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.299
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16:52.340 --> 16:53.773
AMBER KLEIN.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.277
HOW'D YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE PARTY?

16:55.310 --> 16:57.175
MY FRIENDS.
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

16:57.210 --> 16:58.973
NO.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.648
(clicks)
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?
YOU SEE HIM?

17:00.680 --> 17:02.375
IS HE THE ONE
THAT GOT STABBED?

17:02.420 --> 17:05.014
(radio chatter)

17:05.050 --> 17:07.587
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHERE THIS BLOOD CAME FROM?

17:09.090 --> 17:10.728
I-I DON'T KNOW.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.320
I-I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
SWEATER BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.760
YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?
LOOKS GOOD.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.234
NO OFFENSE, BUT I'M REALLY
NOT IN THE MOOD

17:22.270 --> 17:23.430
FOR BONDING RIGHT NOW.

17:23.470 --> 17:24.869
OKAY.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.174
UH, LOOK.
MY DAD WAS A COP,

17:27.210 --> 17:29.678
SO IF IT FEELS LIKE OLIVER'S
BEING REALLY HARD ON YOU,

17:29.710 --> 17:32.178
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S TRYING
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.542
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO BE
AN ADULT ABOUT THIS.

17:34.580 --> 17:35.774
HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.708
LIKE UNCLE SAMMY'S
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.889
NO, 'CAUSE
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.218
COOL HAIR.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.184
AH. BLUE.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.027
ARE YOU ON SOMETHING NOW?

17:47.060 --> 17:48.493
HARDLY.

17:51.430 --> 17:52.465
(sets down container)
FINE.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.889
TOOK SOME OXY.
WHATEVER.

17:57.970 --> 17:59.699
YOU TOOK SOME OXY?

17:59.740 --> 18:01.537
DID YOU HEAR THAT, MCNALLY?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.445
SHE TOOK SOME OXY.
"WHATEVER."

18:03.480 --> 18:06.301
WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S--
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.215
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
THROW ME IN JAIL?

18:09.220 --> 18:10.642
WORSE.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.682
(telephones ringing in distance)

18:15.660 --> 18:17.628
YOU CALLED MOM?

18:17.660 --> 18:20.197
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING.
SHE MUST HAVE SNUCK OUT.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.595
IT'S LIKE ONE DAY
YOU WAKE UP,

18:21.630 --> 18:23.120
AND YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A STRANGER.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.865
WELL, SHE'LL FIND
HER WAY BACK, YOU KNOW?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.561
IT'S--THE WORST THING YOU CAN
DO IS OVERPROTECT HER.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.136
SHE'LL JUST
PUSH YOU AWAY.

18:28.170 --> 18:30.604
OH. PARENTING ADVICE
FROM SAM SWAREK.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.937
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

18:35.980 --> 18:37.208
I LOVE YOU?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.308
LET'S GO.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.847
ZOE, I'LL COME BY
THE HOUSE AFTER SHIFT.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.689
NO, DON'T, OKAY?
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.187
I GOTTA GO.
THE GIRLS ARE IN THE CAR.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.847
NO, NO, NO.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.154
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN
LIKE THIS?

18:49.190 --> 18:50.851
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.757
OH. EVER--THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
(laughs)

18:53.800 --> 18:55.290
EVER SINCE I LEFT?
YEAH. I GOTTA GET HER HOME.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.469
WELL, HEY, ZOE--ZO--

18:57.500 --> 19:00.094
(door buzzes and beeps)

19:06.070 --> 19:08.334
OKAY, WHERE--
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

19:08.380 --> 19:09.677
YOU DIDN'T.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.143
SHE'S JUST BEING
WHAT'S NATURAL.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.670
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.177
A TEENAGER WHO THINKS
SHE'S INVINCIBLE.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.518
HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US.
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:16.550 --> 19:19.087
ARE WE--WE'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT ME HERE, RIGHT?
LOOKING FOR JERRY.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.109
WHY? WHAT'S UP?

19:20.150 --> 19:21.458
PECKSTEIN FOUND
A BLOODY SWEATSHIRT

19:21.490 --> 19:23.082
ON ONE OF THE WAREHOUSE KIDS.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.985
SUSPECT'S BEEN BROUGHT IN.
WHAT--WHICH ONE?
WHAT'S HER NAME?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.089
AMBER KLEIN.

19:27.130 --> 19:29.291
I CHIPPED THAT KID'S TOOTH.

19:29.330 --> 19:30.820
YOU HAD A BUSY NIGHT.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.565
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
TWO SUMMERS AGO.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.192
BADMINTON. AMBER KLEIN.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.367
THAT'S IZZY'S BEST FRIEND.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.829
(woman)
SHE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.472
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE THAT SHIRT CAME FROM.

19:43.510 --> 19:46.843
THEN WHY DID OUR OFFICERS
FIND IT IN HER BAG?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.575
AMBER, DO YOU KNOW
WHO IT BELONGS TO?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.348
WE'RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION
THAT IT'S NOT YOURS,

19:52.390 --> 19:53.812
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
HIDING SOMETHING.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.213
(woman) SHOULD I BE
CALLING MY LAWYER?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.319
DETECTIVE BARBER, CAN I
SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE?

20:00.130 --> 20:04.066
(indistinct conversations)

20:04.100 --> 20:06.523
JERRY. I GOT THIS.

20:06.570 --> 20:09.061
IT'S A TEENAGE GIRL AND HER MOM.
IT'S KIND OF MY SPECIALTY.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.409
WAIT. ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO STEP OUT OF THE INTERVIEW?

20:11.440 --> 20:14.170
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU
THAT I CAN DO MORE.

20:14.210 --> 20:15.700
IT'S JUST THESE PAST
COUPLE OF SHIFTS

20:15.740 --> 20:17.799
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF
PICKING UP YOUR COFFEE.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.512
I JUST--INSTEAD OF DOING
MY JOB, I FEEL LIKE I'M--I'M--

20:20.550 --> 20:22.518
DETECTIVE IN TRAINING?

20:22.550 --> 20:24.211
I WAS GONNA SAY
GIRL FRIDAY.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.309
OKAY, TRACI, LOOK.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.784
Y-YOU'RE LOW RUNG
ON THE LADDER.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.924
YOU'RE DOING THIS STUFF
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR JOB.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.928
YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING IT
WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.621
BUT IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE ENJOYING

20:34.660 --> 20:36.719
BOSSING ME AROUND
A LITTLE BIT.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.923
OR MAYBE YOU EXPECT
SOME SPECIAL TREATMENT. NO?

20:39.970 --> 20:43.838
OKAY. UH, WHY DON'T YOU START
FILING THE CASE FROM LAST WEEK,

20:43.870 --> 20:45.963
AND I'LL GET BACK
TO THE INTERVIEW, OKAY?
JERRY--

20:46.010 --> 20:49.229
NO, NO, NO. YOU GO AHEAD.
OH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
(coins rattling)

20:49.280 --> 20:53.102
UH, GET ME CAN OF SODA
WHEN YOU GET A SEC.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.670
(coins rattle)

20:59.020 --> 21:02.649
(woman speaking indistinctly
on P.A.)

21:02.690 --> 21:04.681
(radio chatter)

21:04.730 --> 21:06.584
I'M OFFICER DIAZ.
THIS IS OFFICER COLLINS.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.120
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.390
WE DIDN'T FIND ANY I.D. ON YOU.
GOT A NAME?

21:10.430 --> 21:11.897
ALAN BAN KS.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.864
NICK.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.061
I, UH, NOTICED YOUR TAT.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.601
WHERE WERE YOU STATIONED?

21:17.640 --> 21:19.005
ZHARI.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.064
PANJWAI.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.343
(radio chatter)

21:23.380 --> 21:25.541
YEAH. ANYWAY, UM...

21:25.580 --> 21:28.014
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT, ALAN?

21:28.050 --> 21:30.268
I WAS LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO STAY.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.844
I FOUND THAT WAREHOUSE.
IT WAS DECENT,

21:31.890 --> 21:33.118
SO I SET UP FOR THE NIGHT.

21:33.150 --> 21:34.856
YEAH? THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

21:34.890 --> 21:36.778
WELL, THE KIDS SHOW UP
READY TO PARTY.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.186
I DECIDE TO TAKE OFF.

21:39.230 --> 21:40.288
ON MY WAY OUT,

21:40.330 --> 21:42.127
I SEE THIS GUY
SHOVING AROUND A GIRL.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.798
SO I DECIDE TO STEP IN.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.525
SUDDENLY THEY BOTH
COME AT ME.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.060
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.637
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED, RIGHT?

21:49.670 --> 21:51.900
YEAH. YOU SAID IT.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.430
DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE
STABBED YOU?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.972
YEAH. THE GUY WAS...
AVERAGE HEIGHT, DARK HAIR,

21:57.010 --> 21:58.875
MEAN EYES.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.344
HE WAS WEARING A DENIM VEST,
LONG-SLEEVED SHIRT.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.109
PROBABLY IN HIS 20$.

22:03.150 --> 22:05.209
AND THE GIRL THAT WAS WITH HIM--
WHAT'D SHE LOOK LIKE?

22:05.250 --> 22:08.549
(sighs) SHE WAS YOUNG.

22:08.590 --> 22:10.478
I DON'T KNOW. REGULAR,
EXCEPT FOR THE HAIR.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.020
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:12.060 --> 22:14.119
IT WAS BRIGHT BLUE.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.492
ACTUALLY LOOKED
KIN DA COOL.

22:16.530 --> 22:19.567
***

22:24.340 --> 22:25.932
SHE WAS UP ALL NIGHT.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.335
SHE'S EXHAUSTED.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.008
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER
BACK TO THE STATION NOW?

22:30.040 --> 22:32.349
THE VICTIM I.D.'d HER.
SHE IS A MATERIAL WITNESS.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.847
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
THE VICTIM'S WRONG.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.110
I'M HOPING THAT HE IS.
HER ROOM?

22:36.150 --> 22:37.947
YEAH.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.129
SHE'S GONE.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.650
WHERE WOULD SHE GO?

22:46.690 --> 22:48.624
I DON'T KNOW.
(cell phone dialing)

22:48.660 --> 22:50.560
OUT THE WINDOW.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.067
SAM, IZZY'S GONE.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.328
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE ARE YOU?

22:53.370 --> 22:54.997
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT FOR ME.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.598
WHAT?

22:58.970 --> 23:00.335
ALL RIGHT.

23:00.370 --> 23:01.701
STAY PUT IN CASE
SHE COMES BACK, ALL RIGHT?

23:01.740 --> 23:03.378
MCNALLY AND I WILL
START LOOKING, ALL RIGHT?

23:03.410 --> 23:05.708
YOU STAY THERE.
(cell phone beeps)

23:05.750 --> 23:07.445
IZZY SHAW TOOK OFF.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.118
OKAY. I'M GONNA TAKE
ANOTHER RUN AT THE KLEIN GIRL.

23:09.150 --> 23:11.618
COME ON.

23:11.650 --> 23:14.187
(door buzzes and beeps)
MRS. KLEIN,
IZZY SHAW RAN AWAY,

23:14.220 --> 23:16.950
SO IF AMBER KNOWS SOMETHING,
SHE NEEDS TO TELL US NOW.
(door closes)

23:16.990 --> 23:20.050
AMBER, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE IS?

23:20.090 --> 23:22.194
OKAY, LET ME HELP YOU.
SHE WAS LAST SEEN

23:22.230 --> 23:24.095
WITH SOME GUY--
AVERAGE HEIGHT, DARK HAIR,

23:24.130 --> 23:25.688
LONG-SLEEVED SHIRT,
DENIM VEST?

23:27.230 --> 23:29.767
I-I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW IZZY THAT WELL.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.734
Y-YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T KNOW
IZZY THAT WELL?

23:31.770 --> 23:33.408
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT IZZY'S DAD SAYS.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.079
SO WHY DON'T WE TRY THIS AGAIN?
THE GUY WHO WAS STABBED

23:36.110 --> 23:38.840
SAID A GIRL MATCHING
IZZY'S DESCRIPTION WAS THERE.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.212
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?
YOU'RE SCARING HER.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.672
I GOT AN OFFICER'S
DAUGHTER MISSING.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.210
I GOT ANOTHER GUY
IN THE HOSPITAL,

23:44.250 --> 23:46.047
SO I COULDN'T CARE LESS
IF PRINCESS HERE

23:46.090 --> 23:48.684
IS A LITTLE SHAKEN UP
BY THE QUESTIONS.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.529
(exhales sharply)

23:50.560 --> 23:54.394
(sobbing)

23:55.630 --> 23:57.029
OKAY.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.790
(door buzzes and beeps)

24:01.040 --> 24:02.996
(radio chatter)
(typing)

24:03.040 --> 24:05.008
(telephones ringing in distance)

24:07.610 --> 24:10.135
(ty_ping)
(Slghs)

24:11.250 --> 24:15.914
TRACE, I NEED YOU.
(clears throat)

24:15.950 --> 24:18.817
(chair rattles)

24:24.330 --> 24:26.719
(door buzzes and beeps)
AMBER, I'M SORRY.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.558
I KNOW IT'S BEEN HOURS,
BUT WE JUST--

24:29.600 --> 24:31.966
WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW THIS BLOODY SWEATER

24:32.000 --> 24:34.639
ENDED UP IN YOUR BAG.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.695
(sighs)

24:36.740 --> 24:38.298
(sniffles)
THAT'S NOT HER BAG.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.672
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.179
AMBER.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.701
WELL, IF IT'S NOT YOURS,
WHOSE IS IT?

24:48.780 --> 24:52.989
AMBER, WHEN DID IZZY
DYE HER HAIR?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.048
I DON'T KNOW.

24:57.090 --> 24:58.887
ABOUT A WEEK AGO,
I GUESS. SHE--

24:58.930 --> 25:00.557
SHE JUST WANTED TO TRY
A NEW LOOK.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.851
YEAH.
(sniffles)

25:01.900 --> 25:03.720
WHY? WAS SHE--WAS SHE HANGING
AROUND WITH NEW PEOPLE?

25:03.770 --> 25:06.398
WAS SHE TRYING TO FIT IN?

25:06.430 --> 25:08.739
JUST 'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I DO.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.204
THERE'S A NEW CREW, NEW ME.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.538
EXCEPT, UH, YOU CAN REALLY
LOSE YOURSELF THAT WAY

25:13.580 --> 25:16.731
IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD FRIENDS
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.572
THE THING IS SOMETIMES
IT'S HARD TO CALL PEOPLE OUT.

25:22.620 --> 25:25.248
IT TAKES GUTS.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.144
AMBER, WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?

25:27.190 --> 25:30.580
WHOSE BAG IS IT?
(exhales sharply)

25:30.630 --> 25:33.281
IT'S IZZY'S, OKAY?

25:34.800 --> 25:37.689
SHE LEFT IT BEHIND,
SO... I JUST GRABBED IT.

25:37.730 --> 25:39.561
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING WAS IN IT.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.568
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.501
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHO
SHE MIGHT BE WITH TONIGHT?

25:44.540 --> 25:46.861
SHE'S WITH T.K., OKAY?

25:46.910 --> 25:49.674
SHE KEPT HIM A SECRET
FROM HER PARENTS

25:49.710 --> 25:51.575
BECAUSE... HE'S OLDER.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.579
T.K.? T.K? WH-WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A NAME?

25:54.620 --> 25:58.215
(exhales) HE'S A DEALER,
OKAY?

25:58.250 --> 25:59.945
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS REAL NAME IS.

25:59.990 --> 26:01.719
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE
CALLS HIM.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.250
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.549
I DON'T KNOW.

26:06.590 --> 26:09.297
BUT HE'S--HE'S PROBABLY
WITH IZZY.

26:09.330 --> 26:11.764
(Amber exhales)

26:11.800 --> 26:17.136
I'M GONNA CALL ZOE AND SEE
IF SHE KNOWS WHO THIS T.K. IS.
(door buzzes and beeps)

26:17.170 --> 26:19.900
I NEVER HEARD OF THE GUY.
WELL, HE'S THE BEST CHANCE WE
GOT AT FINDING IZZY RIGHT NOW.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.100
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT IF WE DON'T?

26:21.140 --> 26:22.607
SHE COULD BE HALFWAY
TO WHO-KNOWS-WHERE.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.403
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
(typing)

26:24.450 --> 26:26.372
DON'T "GOOD COP" ME RIGHT NOW,
OKAY?

26:26.410 --> 26:27.718
I'M NOT
SOME HYSTERICAL MOTHER

26:27.750 --> 26:29.411
WHO JUST WALKED INTO
YOUR DIVISION. I'M YOUR WIFE.

26:29.450 --> 26:31.315
YEAH, THAT'S THE REASON
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING IN A MOTEL

26:31.350 --> 26:33.853
THE LAST FOUR MONTHS.
(paper rustllng)

26:35.760 --> 26:37.113
GOT IT.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.526
HEY, I'M COMING WITH YOU.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.619
HEY, ZOE, YOU HAVE TO
STAY HERE, OKAY?

26:41.660 --> 26:43.548
WE GOTTA WORK AS A TEAM.
WELL--

26:43.600 --> 26:45.158
I-IN CASE IZZY COMES BACK.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.418
I'M GONNA FIND THIS T.K. GUY
AND I'M GONNA SEE WHAT HE KNOWS.

26:47.470 --> 26:49.165
DON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HER.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.737
OH, HONEY, THIS IS OUR GIRL.
THIS IS OUR GIRL OUT THERE.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.307
(voice breaking) IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS, ANYTHING--

26:54.340 --> 26:57.434
I PROMISE I'M GONNA FIND HER
AND I'M GONNA BRING HER HOME.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.548
OKAY. WELL, I THINK I GOT
EVERYTHING I NEED.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.309
THE WITNESS SAW NOTHING.

27:04.350 --> 27:05.647
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.317
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.386
(indistinct conversations,
camera shutter clicking)

27:09.420 --> 27:11.888
YOU DONE ABUSING
YOUR MEAGER POWER?

27:11.930 --> 27:13.557
TWO PATHS DIVERGE
IN THE WOODS, GAIL.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.898
HE CHOSE THE WRONG ONE.

27:14.930 --> 27:17.660
NEXT TIME HE'LL MAKE
A BETTER CHOICE.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.225
RIGHT. YEAH.
BETTER CHOICES.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.568
SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.966
ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.568
(indistinct conversations
conﬁnue)

27:26.610 --> 27:28.032
CRYSTAL MARKES.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.047
WELL, YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE
IN THE SQUAD EARLIER.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.877
(camera shutter
continues clicking)

27:33.920 --> 27:36.844
DOV, PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT
THE GIRL WHOSE BROTHER YOU SHOT.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.711
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO ANSWER MY PHONE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HER?

27:38.750 --> 27:40.308
I DRIVE HER AROUND
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE--

27:40.350 --> 27:41.658
TO CLASS, TO WORK--
THAT'S IT.

27:41.690 --> 27:43.851
BECAUSE OF ME, HER BROTHER'S
NEVER COMING BACK.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.289
DOV, SO, WHAT, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE HANGING AROUND HER

27:45.330 --> 27:47.798
TO REMIND HER OF THAT?
NO, TO REMIND ME.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.821
SO I NEVER FORGET.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.192
OKAY. I-I KNOW YOU KILLED
SOMEBODY,

27:52.230 --> 27:54.039
AND I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
TO UNDERSTAND

27:54.070 --> 27:55.799
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE,
'CAUSE I DON'T--
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.762
SO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.938
***

28:02.010 --> 28:03.432
(radio chatter)

28:07.580 --> 28:09.218
WE GOT A LEAD
ON YOUR CASE.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.684
ONCE WE GET CONFIRMATION,
WE CAN HAVE YOU I.D. THEM.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.950
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME.

28:13.990 --> 28:16.356
UNTIL YOU GET BETTER.
THEN WHAT?

28:16.390 --> 28:17.755
(monitor beeping)

28:17.790 --> 28:21.499
YOU'RE WEARING A WEDDING RING.
IS THIS ANYONE WE SHOULD CALL?

28:21.530 --> 28:23.760
NO. I MESSED THAT UP
A WHILE AGO.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.893
RING'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE LEFT.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.798
PATCH OF BAD LUCK.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.637
COLLINS.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.707
(respirator hissing,
monitor continues beeping)

28:36.240 --> 28:39.141
(radio chatter)
HEY, WE'RE NOT GOING
JUST YET.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.841
OLIVER'S DAUGHTER
IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.347
I'D LIKE TO FIND HER.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.019
LOOK, GUY SERVED, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.347
AND YOU'RE NOT
PART OF 15's?

28:46.390 --> 28:48.483
NOT ACCORDING TO YOU,
I'M NOT.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.421
JUST A FEW PHONE CALLS.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.122
JUST LET ME FIND SOMEONE
WHO CARES ABOUT THIS GUY.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.798
(radio chatter)

28:55.830 --> 28:57.866
SO WE RAN A SEARCH
ON THE INITIALS "T.K."

28:57.900 --> 28:59.390

29:12.480 --> 29:14.778
WE GOTTA KEEP OLIVER
AWAY FROM THIS, OKAY?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.469
SO JUST MAKE SURE
HE STAYS IN THE HOUSE.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.669
I DON'T WANT HIM INVOLVED.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.314
YES, I KNOW.
WE'RE HEADING OVER THERE NOW.

29:20.350 --> 29:21.988

29:38.640 --> 29:40.130

30:15.010 --> 30:16.307
UM... (chuckles)

30:16.340 --> 30:17.671
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN COME
IN HERE WITHOUT A WARRANT.

30:17.710 --> 30:19.302

SO DID YOU FIND HIS WIFE?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.348

34:27.390 --> 34:30.553
NO NEXT OF KIN.
GUY'S GOT NOBODY.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.068

36:43.260 --> 36:44.761
(exhales sharply)

36:48.270 --> 36:50.238
(exhales sharply)

36:50.270 --> 36:53.103
HEY. DO YOU WANT
TO COME IN?

36:53.140 --> 36:54.129
YEAH.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.535
(pulls out keys)

36:55.580 --> 36:57.207
(keys rattling)
(sniffles)

36:57.240 --> 36:59.572
YEAH.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.688
(indistinct conversations
and laughter)

37:11.090 --> 37:12.921
(clears throat)
PARTY TIME.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.349
(taps foot)

37:15.400 --> 37:18.927
UH, TECHNICALLY,
SHE'S A CAPRICORN

37:18.970 --> 37:21.359
ON THE CUSP OF SAGITTARIUS.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.506
BUT IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE.
DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.428
(lacing boot)

37:26.470 --> 37:28.438
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WASN'T GONNA SHOOT?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.835
UH, I DIDN'T.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.041
BUT THAT'S MY BROTHER
OUT THERE.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.514
RIGHT OR WRONG, NO MATTER WHAT,
I'M GONNA BACK HIM UP.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.814
YEAH, WELL, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU CAN'T?

37:39.950 --> 37:41.247
IT'S NEVER COME UP.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.550
SO IS THAT...
WHAT THIS WAS?

37:44.590 --> 37:46.228
YOU WERE JUST
BACKING ME UP?

37:46.260 --> 37:48.797
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT.

37:48.830 --> 37:50.127
I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.627
THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

37:51.670 --> 37:53.626
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

37:53.670 --> 37:54.967
BEHIND MY BACK.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.865
OVER SOMETHING THAT REALLY
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.936
MM. SHE FINDS HERSELF
BACK IN YOUR LIFE--

37:58.970 --> 38:00.528
BY ACCIDENT--

38:00.570 --> 38:02.435
AND, UH, NOW SHE WANTS
TO BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.539
I'D HATE TO SEE HER
BREAK YOUR HEART AGAIN.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.048
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED YOU
WEIGHING IN ON EVERYTHING.

38:09.350 --> 38:10.977
(sighs)

38:11.020 --> 38:12.578
(chair thuds)

38:16.620 --> 38:18.759
ANDY...

38:18.790 --> 38:20.951
YOU SAID YOU LIKED MESSY.

38:20.990 --> 38:23.823
WELL, THIS IS ME MESSY,
OKAY?

38:23.860 --> 38:26.328
I MADE A MISTAKE.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.296
I WENT ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.204
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME.

38:36.010 --> 38:38.877
WELL, I GUESS IT BEATS
TAKING THE TRUST-MOBILE.

38:41.310 --> 38:43.414

38:54.730 --> 38:57.392
(mouth full) THAT'S OKAY.
THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM.

38:57.430 --> 39:01.662
YOU ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNER
OF THE KITCHEN CREATIVE SX-300.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.894
(chuckles) THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.329
LOOK, THIS IS SERIOUSLY AMAZING.
WHO--WHO DID THIS?

39:05.370 --> 39:07.008
DOV AND I CHIPPED IN.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.498
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE DECORATIONS.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.269
(Chris) OH.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.402

39:21.050 --> 39:22.654
NO.

39:22.690 --> 39:25.158
I MISSED SO MANY CHANCES
TO THROW YOU A PARTY.

39:25.190 --> 39:26.885
I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS
THIS ONE.

OKAY, LOOK, ABOUT TODAY--

39:49.150 --> 39:50.572
I JUST WANT TO 5--
LET--LET ME START.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.310
YOU WERE JUST TREATING ME
LIKE A DETECTIVE IN TRAINING,

39:54.350 --> 39:57.080
WHICH IS WHAT I AM.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.453
YOU'RE MY SENIOR OFFICER,
AND I NEED TO RESPECT THAT.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.128

40:02.160 --> 40:05.288
SO, PLEASE,
NO MORE WORK TALK.

40:05.330 --> 40:06.399
IT'S A PARTY!

40:06.430 --> 40:07.920
ALL RIGHT.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.665
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT

40:09.700 --> 40:13.329
HOW I AM GOING TO DESTROY YOU
ON THE DANCE FLOOR TONIGHT.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.372
THERE'S NO DANCE FLOOR.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.878
NOT YET, THERE ISN'T.
(laughs)

40:19.180 --> 40:20.943
SO YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

40:20.980 --> 40:24.313
WHERE IS, UH, NICK?

40:24.350 --> 40:26.147
OH, HE, UH...

40:26.190 --> 40:27.782
HE RAN INTO SOMEONE TONIGHT.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.412
MM-HMM. I THINK
HE'S STILL CATCHING UP.

40:32.030 --> 40:36.228

BECAUSE OF YOU.

40:56.380 --> 40:58.268
THANK YOU SO MUCH...
FOR EVERYTHING.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.117

OH. THE RIGHT THING FOR WHO?
FOR BOTH OF US.

41:20.340 --> 41:22.501
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT
BEFORE, BUT--

BUT YOU FIGURED IT OUT, HUH?
YEAH. I DID. (stammers)

41:25.210 --> 41:26.848
BEING AROUND YOU, IT MADE ME
FEEL BETTER, BUT THAT'S--

41:26.880 --> 41:28.404
OH! YOU FORCED YOURSELF
INTO MY LIFE!
(stammerlng)

41:28.450 --> 41:29.769
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
A CHOICE!
I-I KNOW.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.310
I DIDN'T WANT THIS!
I KNOW. IT WAS WRONG.

41:31.350 --> 41:32.988
YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY FROM US
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.885
I KNOW. IT WAS WRONG.
YOU KILLED MY BROTHER!

41:34.920 --> 41:36.581
YOU KILLED MY BROTHER!
I'M SORRY.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.554

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

I'M SORRY. I WAS WRONG.
