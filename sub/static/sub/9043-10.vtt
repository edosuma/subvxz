WEBVTT

00:03.233 --> 00:05.433
- WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO MY DICTIONARY?

00:05.433 --> 00:06.900
- OH, YEAH, RAY. I'M SORRY.
I WAS GONNA TELL YA.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.600
I CAUGHT THE BOYS
SLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS ON IT.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.833
- OH, COME ON.
IT'S RUINED.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.300
LOOK AT THIS.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.233
THE LEATHER BINDING'S
ALL COMING OFF THE...

00:15.233 --> 00:18.367
PAGES ARE MISSING.
THE COVER'S COMING OFF IT.

00:18.367 --> 00:20.600
- CALM DOWN, RAY.
IT'S JUST A DICTIONARY.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.467
- IT'S NOT JUST
A DICTIONARY, ROBERT, ALL RIGHT?

00:23.467 --> 00:26.500
I WON THIS IN
THE SEVENTH GRADE SPELLING BEE.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.333
- AH, ANOTHER ONE
OF RAYMOND'S TRIUMPHS.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.700
SEVENTH GRADE SPELLING.

00:31.700 --> 00:35.433
GOSH, WHAT WORD PUT YOU
OVER THE TOP, RAYMOND?

00:35.433 --> 00:38.200
"BOAT"?

00:40.333 --> 00:43.067
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I HAD TO SPELL "VACUUM."

00:43.067 --> 00:46.600
OKAY? TWO "U"s.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.133
OR TWO "C"s.

00:50.133 --> 00:54.133
I DON'T KNOW,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO "V" IN HERE.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.000
- [laughs]

00:58.000 --> 01:00.633
WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND, HUH, RAY?

01:00.633 --> 01:02.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:02.067 --> 01:04.500
- JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RUINED
MY JAZZ RECORDS.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.400
- OH, DAD, LOOK,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.067
WE ALL KNOW THE STORY,
OKAY, SO NOT AGAIN.

01:09.067 --> 01:11.267
- WHY NOT?
IT'S A SHORT STORY.

01:11.267 --> 01:14.433
ONCE UPON A TIME,
I HAD GREAT JAZZ RECORDS.

01:14.433 --> 01:18.967
YOU WERE BORN.
NOW I DON'T.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.467
- ALL RIGHT.

01:20.467 --> 01:23.600
YOU BEEN ON ME FOR THIS
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.733
- I BELIEVE IT WAS
THE WINTER OF '69.

01:25.733 --> 01:27.167
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

01:27.167 --> 01:28.433
- I HAD JUST COME HOME
FROM A HARD DAY'S WORK--

01:28.433 --> 01:29.967
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:29.967 --> 01:31.800
NO, IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS,
THEN JUST GO HOME.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.000
OKAY, JUST TELL YOUR STORY
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.467
- YEAH, COME ON, DAD.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.100
LET'S GET MA
TO MAKE US SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.333
- HEY, RAY, IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE ACROSS THE STREET

01:38.333 --> 01:42.267
NOT LISTENING
TO MY FAVORITE JAZZ RECORDS.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.400
YOU NEVER TOUCHED
MY STUFF, ROBERT.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.333
IT'S TOO BAD RAY
WASN'T MORE LIKE YOU.

01:57.533 --> 02:01.667
- PUTZ.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.933
P-U-T-Z.

02:03.933 --> 02:07.367
THE PUTZ WALKED
INTO THE DOOR.

02:07.367 --> 02:10.767
PUTZ.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.500
[sports announcing over TV]
- HEY, DAD.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.100
- HEY.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.533
GO GET ME SOME CHIPS.

02:20.533 --> 02:22.867
- ACTUALLY, I GOT
SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU.

02:22.867 --> 02:24.933
- CHIPS AND DIP?

02:24.933 --> 02:28.133
- LOOK, I GOT YOU
A GIFT, OKAY?

02:28.133 --> 02:30.867
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT TILL
CHRISTMAS TO GIVE IT TO YOU,

02:30.867 --> 02:35.800
SO HERE.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.700
- WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.500
- YOUR JAZZ RECORDS.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.600
- THESE AREN'T MY RECORDS.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.300
- THEY'RE BETTER
THAN RECORDS.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.433
THEY'RE CDs
OF YOUR OLD RECORDS.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.133
WHERE'S YOUR
CD PLAYER?

02:48.133 --> 02:50.100
- I DON'T HAVE
A CD PLAYER.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.033
- NO, YOU DO.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.367
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

02:53.367 --> 02:54.933
DEBRA AND I
GOT YOU A PORTABLE ONE.

02:54.933 --> 02:56.700
- OH, YEAH.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
IT'S PROBABLY
IN THE BASEMENT.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.500
- OKAY. GOOD. WAIT HERE.
I'M GONNA GET IT.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.367
- YOUR MOTHER'S DOWN THERE
DOING LAUNDRY.

03:06.367 --> 03:11.133
TELL HER BREAK TIME IS OVER.
I'M STARVING!

03:11.133 --> 03:14.833
- HEY, MOM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:14.833 --> 03:18.167
- YOUR FATHER SAYS THE DRYER
MAKES HIS PANTS TOO TIGHT.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.000
- I THINK THAT'S
THE REFRIGERATOR.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.600
LISTEN, YOU GOT
A CD PLAYER?

03:28.600 --> 03:31.133
- YES, WE DO.
WOULD YOU LIKE IT?

03:31.133 --> 03:34.133
BECAUSE WE NEED
THE SPACE.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.667
- NO, MA.
WE GAVE IT TO YOU.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.500
- AND WE LOVE IT.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.100
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
WHERE IS IT?

03:40.100 --> 03:43.733
- IT'S OVER THERE.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.933
- OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.

03:49.933 --> 03:52.733
- WOULD YOU LIKE
A POPCORN POPPER?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.800
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE US THAT,
DID YOU?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.233
- MOM, HERE IT IS.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.733
HERE'S THE CD PLAYER
DEBRA AND I GOT YOU.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.533
AND LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S A CLOCK RADIO.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.200
A DVD PLAYER.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.900
A MICROWAVE OVEN.

04:04.900 --> 04:08.067
ANOTHER MICROWAVE OVEN!

04:08.067 --> 04:09.667
LOOK AT THIS.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.200
YOU DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
TAKING THE WRAPPING OFF IT.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.300
- WE DON'T NEED
AN ELECTRICAL KNIFE.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.133
CUTTING MEAT IS
YOUR FATHER'S ONLY EXERCISE.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.733
[door opens]
- HEY, MARIE, LET'S GO.

04:19.733 --> 04:24.100
I NEED A DAMN SANDWICH
BEFORE I GET CRANKY.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.933
- DAD, LOOK AT
ALL THIS STUFF, HUH?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.600
IT'S JUST SITTING HERE.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.033
- WHAT, MOUNT CRAP-MORE?

04:31.033 --> 04:33.333
- THIS STUFF,
IT'S NOT CRAP, DAD.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.333
MOM, YOU SHOULD PUT
THIS MICROWAVE IN THE KITCHEN.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.633
IT'S GREAT.
DEBRA HAS THE SAME MODEL.

04:37.633 --> 04:41.133
- WELL, I'M SOLD.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.600
- DAD, YOU WANT
A POT ROAST?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.000
YOU CAN HAVE IT
IN 15 MINUTES WITH THIS.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.800
- I CAN GET IT IN TEN
WITH THIS.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.433
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS--LOOK--
AUTOMATIC GARAGE-DOOR OPENER?

04:51.433 --> 04:56.867
YOU DON'T GOT TO BREAK
YOUR BACK LIFTING THE DOOR.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.500
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.067
MOM CAN COOK,
AND SHE CAN LIFT A DOOR.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.767
BUT...SHE CANNOT

05:03.767 --> 05:06.900
REPRODUCE THE FINEST MUSIC
OF THE 20TH CENTURY

05:06.900 --> 05:10.400
WITH CRYSTAL CLEAR
DIGITAL QUALITY.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.733
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE BEEN TOLD

05:11.733 --> 05:14.833
THAT I HAVE
A MARVELOUS SINGING VOICE.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.000
- I KNOW YOU DO, MA,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.433
BUT WAIT UNTIL
YOU HEAR THIS.

05:17.433 --> 05:21.367
THIS'LL ONLY
TAKE A SECOND.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.767
- LOOK AT ALL THOSE WIRES.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.667
YOU KNOW WHAT LOVES WIRES?

05:25.667 --> 05:28.433
DUST.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.100
- DON'T TOUCH
MY TOOLS.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.333
- I DON'T NEED TOOLS, DAD.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.600
- LOOK HOW COMPLICATED
IT LOOKS.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.033
- MA, IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU JUST--YOU PLUG IT IN.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.400
- YEAH, I CAN SEE
THE ELECTRIC COMPANY

05:37.400 --> 05:40.367
RUBBING THEIR MITTS
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.167
- DAD, IT ONLY USES
A LITTLE POWER,

05:42.167 --> 05:43.300
AND IT'S EASY TO USE.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.700
YOU JUST PUSH
THAT BUTTON,

05:44.700 --> 05:46.367
YOU OPEN UP THE TRAY,

05:46.367 --> 05:49.733
YOU GRAB A CD,
AND YOU POP IT IN.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.233
VOILA.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.967
JUST GOT TO--YOU TAKE
THE WRAPPING OFF.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.133
SPINE OUT.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.033
PUT THE THING IN.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.233
ALL RIGHT...

06:00.233 --> 06:02.700
A LITTLE, UH...

06:02.700 --> 06:05.733
- RAYMOND, MAYBE
YOU COULD USE THIS.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.333
- I DON'T NEED THAT, MA.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.433
- MAYBE YOU COULD USE
A BLOWTORCH.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.600
- LOOK, SEE, LISTEN--
WHEN YOU GET THE PLASTIC OFF,

06:15.600 --> 06:17.267
ALL YOU DO
IS INSERT THE DISC,

06:17.267 --> 06:19.867
YOU CLOSE THE TRAY,
YOU PUT THE SELECTOR ON CD,

06:19.867 --> 06:21.233
AND PRESS PLAY.

06:21.233 --> 06:24.667
- WE'RE NOT ASTRONAUTS,
RAYMOND.

06:24.667 --> 06:27.967
- FINE. I'LL WRITE IT DOWN
FOR YOU, MA.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.567
- CAN I GO UP NOW?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.667
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.900
HERE WE GO.

06:33.900 --> 06:38.233
OKAY, JUST GOT TO GET
THIS STICKY THING OFF.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.267
DAD, YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE THIS, DAD.

06:40.267 --> 06:44.533
YOU'RE GONNA BE BLOWN AWAY
WHEN YOU HEAR THIS.

06:44.533 --> 06:48.733
- THIS IS WHERE I USED
TO LISTEN TO 'EM.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.600
I'D COME HOME
FROM A HARD DAY'S WORK,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
YOUR MOTHER
WOULD MIX ME A DRINK,

06:52.600 --> 06:55.367
I'D COME DOWN HERE,
PUT ON THE HI-FI,

06:55.367 --> 06:59.667
AND LET DUKE AND DIZZY
TAKE ME AWAY...

06:59.667 --> 07:03.333
...FROM YOUR MOTHER.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.533
- I ALMOST GOT IT, DAD.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.267
- AND THEN ONE DAY,
I CAME DOWN,

07:06.267 --> 07:07.733
AND WHERE MY RECORDS
USED TO BE,

07:07.733 --> 07:10.400
YOU HAD SET UP YOUR
STUPID RACE-CAR TRACK THING.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.067
MY RECORDS
WERE OVER THERE,

07:12.067 --> 07:14.933
PUSHED UP AGAINST
THE FURNACE.

07:14.933 --> 07:18.800
THEY DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.067
- OPEN.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.600
- COME ON, MARIE.
I'M STARVING.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.367
- NO, WAIT, DAD.
I'M GETTING IT NOW.

07:23.367 --> 07:27.000
- WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,
SHUT OFF THE LIGHTS, RAYMOND.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.633
- STOP, I'M GETTING IT.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.667
IT'S ALMOST OPEN.
WILL YOU STOP IT?

07:30.667 --> 07:31.867
STOP! I'M GONNA GET IT!

07:31.867 --> 07:33.200
YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR IT IN A FEW SECONDS!

07:33.200 --> 07:34.367
WILL YOU STOP IT?

07:34.367 --> 07:36.133
ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.600
FORGET IT.
FORG--

07:40.967 --> 07:44.633
FORGET IT.

07:44.633 --> 07:48.467
I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH EITHER OF YOU.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.400
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.133
MY MOTHER
AND MY FATHER,

08:01.133 --> 08:04.567
WE'RE THROUGH
WITH 'EM.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.367
- YOU READ MY LETTER
TO SANTA.

08:11.267 --> 08:13.700
- HE'S--
HE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.300
YOU KNOW, I TRY TO DO
SOMETHING NICE.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.500
I--I TRY
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.600
- UH...RAY?

08:24.600 --> 08:28.767
WHAT HAPPENED
OVER THERE?

08:28.767 --> 08:29.933
- THIS IS MY MOTHER'S.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.700
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:31.700 --> 08:32.767
NOTHING HAPPENED.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.267
OKAY, HE WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO THE CDs,

08:34.267 --> 08:35.600
BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT RECORDS.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.733
EW!

08:36.733 --> 08:39.900
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN. LISTEN--

08:39.900 --> 08:41.200
- NO, YOU GOT TO
GET RID OF THAT.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.500
- OKAY, I'LL WRAP IT.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.400
I NEED A STOCKING STUFFER
FOR YOUR MOTHER ANYWAY.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.633
AT LEAST I KNOW
SHE'LL LIKE IT.

08:49.633 --> 08:51.433
- I HOPE NONE OF THESE
ARE FOR HIM.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.000
'CAUSE HE'S JUST GONNA
PUT 'EM IN THE BASEMENT

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
OR TRADE 'EM IN FOR
A BUGGY WHIP AND WOODEN TEETH.

09:00.433 --> 09:03.000
- RAY,
YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.733
HE HATES ANYTHING NEW.

09:04.733 --> 09:07.367
- YES, BUT IF HE WOULD
JUST LISTEN TO THE CDs

09:07.367 --> 09:10.600
AND HEAR HOW GREAT THEY SOUND,
I KNOW HE WOULD LOVE THEM.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.333
- NO, RAY, HE WOULDN'T.
- YES, HE WOULD.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.767
- RAY, WOULD YOU JUST COME HERE.
- I CAN'T STAND HIM.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.633
- COME ON, SIT DOWN.
- WHY CAN'T HE JUST--

09:15.633 --> 09:16.633
- SIT DOWN.

09:16.633 --> 09:20.300
- I'M ALL CLENCHY.
- [scoffs]

09:20.300 --> 09:22.400
LET'S REMEMBER...

09:22.400 --> 09:25.700
THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE YOUR PROBLEM.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.133
ANY TIME YOUR FATHER
BRINGS UP THOSE JAZZ RECORDS,

09:29.133 --> 09:31.067
DON'T LET YOURSELF
GET SUCKED IN.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.667
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.600
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
AS BAD AS HIM, DO YOU?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.400
DON'T RESPOND.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.967
YOU'RE BETTER THAN HIM.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.233
- DAMN STRAIGHT.
- YEAH.

09:40.233 --> 09:42.133
LET HIM BE MAD.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.000
LET HIM HOLD ONTO IT.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.933
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.233
THIS IS HIS PROBLEM.

09:47.233 --> 09:51.033
YOU CAN MOVE ON.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.533
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?
- WHAT?

09:56.533 --> 09:58.267
- I'M GONNA SNEAK IN
AND SET UP THE CD PLAYER!

09:58.267 --> 10:00.333
- RAY, YOU WEREN'T EVEN
LISTENING TO--

10:00.333 --> 10:02.200
- YES, WHEN THEY GO OUT TONIGHT,
I'M GOING IN.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.433
THAT OLD MAN,

10:03.433 --> 10:04.800
HE'S GONNA HEAR
HOW GREAT CDs ARE

10:04.800 --> 10:06.400
AND THAT THEY'RE BETTER
THAN RECORDS,

10:06.400 --> 10:07.600
AND THAT WILL SHUT HIM UP
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.967
YES, MWAH!
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

10:09.967 --> 10:13.600
[humming "Deck the Halls"]

10:17.633 --> 10:20.500
- RAY?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.133
- OH, HEY.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.200
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.633
I'M WAITING FOR MY PARENTS.

10:24.633 --> 10:25.933
WHEN THEY COME HOME,
I'M GONNA PLAY THE CD.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.433
THEY'RE OUT.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.033
THEY'RE DOING THEIR
LAST-MINUTE CHRISTMAS EVE

10:29.033 --> 10:31.933
SAVE-A-DOLLAR-ON-TINSEL
SHOPPING.

10:31.933 --> 10:33.967
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN BACK THERE?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.633
- ABOUT AN HOUR.

10:36.633 --> 10:39.267
- HONEY, COME ON, COME HOME.
- NO, NO, NO.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.533
I GOT THE CD ALL SET UP.
I GOT THE REMOTE.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.500
AND WHEN THEY COME IN,
I'M JUST GONNA PLAY THE MUSIC,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.300
AND I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
SAY ANYTHING TO THEM.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.367
- I TOLD YOU
LEAVE A LIGHT ON OUT HERE.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.600
I CAN'T EVEN
SEE MY KEYS.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.933
- JUST OPEN
THE DAMN DOOR.

10:50.933 --> 10:55.433
- LOOK OUT.

10:57.733 --> 10:59.233
[jazz music blaring]

10:59.233 --> 11:02.333
- HOLY CRAP!

11:02.333 --> 11:03.500
[overlapping shouts
under loud music]

11:03.500 --> 11:05.233
- TURN IT DOWN!
- I'M TRYING!

11:05.233 --> 11:07.333
YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE LASER--

11:08.233 --> 11:12.333
[music stops]

11:18.833 --> 11:23.900
SEE, WITH A CD, YOU CAN
TURN IT LOUD, NO DISTORTION.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.900
- OH, MY HEART.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.467
OH, MY EGGS.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.333
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO US?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.300
- OH, THAT WAS AWFUL,
RAYMOND.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.600
- YES, AND THESE ORNAMENTS
WERE ON SALE!

11:37.600 --> 11:39.467
- I'M SORRY.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.033
I'M SORRY. I JUST--I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY

11:41.033 --> 11:42.433
TO HEAR YOUR JAZZ RECORDS

11:42.433 --> 11:44.433
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD 'EM BEFORE.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.600
- YEAH, THAT'S LIKE
I'VE NEVER HEARD 'EM BEFORE.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.367
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS GONNA BE

11:48.367 --> 11:51.667
THE SOUND TRACK
TO MY FUNERAL.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.667
- HO, HO, HO.

11:52.667 --> 11:56.500
- WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT,
WATCH OUT!

12:08.733 --> 12:11.767
- WHAT AM I SITTING IN?

12:11.767 --> 12:17.233
- EGGS...AND EGGNOG.

12:17.233 --> 12:22.200
- AND WHAT IS VERY SHARP?

12:22.200 --> 12:25.600
- THAT MIGHT BE
THE MENORAH.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.800
- MENORAH?

12:31.800 --> 12:35.433
- IT WAS A BIG SALE.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.467
- WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

12:41.467 --> 12:45.233
- OH, IT WAS RAYMOND'S
HORRIBLE MACHINE.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.000
- IT'S NOT
A HORRIBLE MACHINE, MOM.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.300
IT'S A CD PLAYER.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.900
PLEASE, LET ME JUST
PLAY YOU ONE SONG.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.667
- OH, GOD, NO.
HE'S GONNA TURN IT ON AGAIN!

12:52.667 --> 12:54.600
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY CDs.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.567
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU RUINED MY RECORDS,

12:56.567 --> 12:58.933
YOU RUINED MY FLOOR,
MY ORNAMENTS,

12:58.933 --> 13:02.267
AND MY COOK!

13:05.267 --> 13:07.433
- LOOK, PLEASE,
JUST LISTEN TO IT.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.167
- NO.
- BUT LISTEN!

13:09.167 --> 13:11.567
- NO!
- GUYS, GUYS.

13:11.567 --> 13:15.167
I THINK...

13:18.133 --> 13:19.233
I THINK...

13:19.233 --> 13:21.700
I THINK I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.733
I WAS GONNA GIVE THIS
TO YOU TOMORROW, DAD,

13:23.733 --> 13:26.600
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SEE IT NOW.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.933
HERE YOU GO, POP.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.667
FROM ME TO YOU.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.600
- THESE ARE MY RECORDS.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.233
- NOT ALL OF THEM.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.367
BUT ROBERT AND I WENT
TO SOME GARAGE SALES

13:43.367 --> 13:45.733
AND USED RECORD STORES
THIS WEEKEND.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.767
- AND I THINK WE CAME ACROSS
SOME OF YOUR FAVORITES.

13:48.767 --> 13:51.333
- "BEN WEBSTER
MEETS OSCAR PETERSON."

13:51.333 --> 13:55.000
I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS ALBUM
IN 30 YEARS.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.733
AHH.
GENUINE AMERICAN VINYL.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.300
- LOOK. LOOK, DAD.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.467
GOT THE SAME
EXACT THING, OKAY?

14:03.467 --> 14:05.200
SEE, BEN MEETS
OSCAR HERE TOO.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.100
OKAY, IT'S THE SAME THING.
LISTEN TO THIS.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.000
- RAY, YOU GOT TO
LET IT GO.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.300
- YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, MAN?

14:10.300 --> 14:12.333
- OH, OH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.533
YOU WOULD LIKE
NOTHING BETTER

14:13.533 --> 14:15.233
THAN TO HAVE ME
SUFFER FOR 30 YEARS,

14:15.233 --> 14:18.233
AND THEN YOU JUST
SWOOP IN AND BE THE HERO.

14:18.233 --> 14:22.833
YEAH, WELL,
NICE TRY, EGG ASS.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.133
ALL RIGHT?

14:24.133 --> 14:26.033
I WAS THE ONE WHO RUINED
THE JAZZ RECORDS.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.533
I'LL BE THE ONE
TO REPLACE THEM.

14:28.533 --> 14:31.933
- OH, WAIT, WAIT,
RAYMOND, WAIT.

14:31.933 --> 14:35.100
ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.867
[jazz music playing]

14:38.867 --> 14:42.500
HUH? LISTEN
TO THAT SOUND.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.633
IT'S LIKE OSCAR PETERSON
IS SITTING

14:46.633 --> 14:49.567
RIGHT HERE AT THE PIANO.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.900
PLAY IT, OSCAR.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.533
PLAY IT,
YOU SWINGING JAZZ CAT.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.200
[music stops]

15:01.200 --> 15:02.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:02.267 --> 15:05.567
- I WANT TO HEAR
MY JAZZ RECORDS.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.567
- YOU CAN'T GIVE IT
TO ME, CAN YOU?

15:07.567 --> 15:11.267
THOSE CDs, THEY SOUND GREAT,
AND YOU KNOW IT,

15:11.267 --> 15:12.667
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE IT UP.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.467
YOU JUST GOT TO
KEEP TORTURING ME!

15:14.467 --> 15:16.200
- I LOVED THOSE DAMN ALBUMS.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
I WAS HOPING SOMEDAY
YOU MIGHT LOVE THEM TOO,

15:19.100 --> 15:22.600
INSTEAD OF YOUR
HIPPIE JUNGLE CRAP.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.133
- THOSE BEATLES
WERE AWFUL, RAYMOND.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.333
- I KNOW, DAD.
I KNOW YOU LOVED 'EM.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.200
OKAY, THAT'S ALL I EVER HEARD.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.467
"SHUT UP, KIDS.
I'M LISTENING TO MY RECORDS."

15:33.467 --> 15:34.700
- THEN WHY THE HELL
DID YOU RUIN 'EM?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.033
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
I WAS 10!

15:37.033 --> 15:38.900
WHY DO YOU KEEP
TAKING THIS OUT ON ME?

15:38.900 --> 15:40.067
- 'CAUSE YOU DID IT!

15:40.067 --> 15:41.100
- I DIDN'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.233
- I'M NOT SO SURE!

15:42.233 --> 15:43.367
- WAIT! LISTEN TO ME...

15:43.367 --> 15:46.233
- WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE!

15:46.233 --> 15:49.933
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

15:49.933 --> 15:54.733
THAT CHRISTMAS DAY
IN 1969...UM...

15:54.733 --> 15:56.167
- WHAT IS IT, ROBERT?

15:56.167 --> 15:59.767
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.600
ALL RIGHT,
THAT CHRISTMAS...

16:10.600 --> 16:13.600
I WANTED THE HOT WHEELS
RACE TRACK SET SO BAD.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.100
I WOULD SEE
THOSE COMMERCIALS,

16:15.100 --> 16:18.000
AND I WOULD THINK,
"THIS IS MY YEAR, MAN."

16:18.000 --> 16:19.600
I COULD SEE MYSELF
SETTING UP

16:19.600 --> 16:21.767
THAT BEAUTIFUL
BRIGHT ORANGE TRACK

16:21.767 --> 16:24.533
WITH THE MAROON CONNECTORS.

16:24.533 --> 16:28.233
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS UNDER
THE TREE WAITING FOR ME?

16:28.233 --> 16:32.033
CUSTOM-ORDER
CORRECTIVE SHOES.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.867
- DR. FISHMAN SAID
THAT THEY WERE THE BEST

16:38.867 --> 16:41.567
FOR OVERSIZED FEET.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.800
- I LOOKED OVER.

16:42.800 --> 16:47.667
I SAW RAYMOND...ELBOW DEEP
IN A BOX OF HOT WHEELS.

16:47.667 --> 16:51.100
MY HOT WHEELS.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.100
- [gasps]

16:53.100 --> 16:55.800
YOU MOVED HIS RECORDS!

16:55.800 --> 16:58.767
- EXCUSE ME, MAY I
FINISH MY STORY, PLEASE?

16:58.767 --> 16:59.967
- GO AHEAD, ROBERT.

16:59.967 --> 17:03.467
- THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, SWEETIE.

17:03.467 --> 17:06.133
I HATED YOU.

17:09.467 --> 17:12.567
YOU GOT MY HOT WHEELS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.433
EVERYTHING I EVER
DREAMED ABOUT:

17:14.433 --> 17:17.067
THE TRACK, THE CARS,
THE LOOP-DE-LOOP.

17:17.067 --> 17:20.233
- YOU MOVED HIS RECORDS.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.833
- LATER THAT DAY,

17:21.833 --> 17:25.067
AFTER RAYMOND WAS TIRED OF
PLAYING WITH HIS NEW HOT WHEELS,

17:25.067 --> 17:27.067
FOR A TOTAL
OF FOUR MINUTES,

17:27.067 --> 17:30.600
I PULLED OFF
MY CLUNKY CORRECTIVE SHOES

17:30.600 --> 17:33.167
AND SLIPPED DOWNSTAIRS.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.600
NOW IT WAS MY TURN.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.933
RAYMOND, OF COURSE,
HAD THE TRACK SET UP ALL WRONG.

17:38.933 --> 17:43.133
AN OVAL.

17:43.133 --> 17:46.733
OH, WHAT A VISIONARY
YOU ARE.

17:50.633 --> 17:53.433
I WANTED TO SET IT UP
LIKE THE KID ON THE BOX,

17:53.433 --> 17:57.233
THAT HAPPY, BROTHERLESS BOY.

18:01.933 --> 18:04.600
AND, IN DOING SO,

18:04.600 --> 18:09.667
YOUR RECORDS
MAY HAVE BEEN MOVED.

18:09.667 --> 18:13.333
- THEY MAY HAVE?

18:13.333 --> 18:14.333
- I MOVED YOUR RECORDS.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.267
- YOU MOVED HIS RECORDS!

18:20.167 --> 18:22.300
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:22.300 --> 18:26.167
YOU--YOU LET ME SUFFER
FOR 30 YEARS!

18:28.033 --> 18:31.667
- YES.

18:34.500 --> 18:38.300
- YOU TWO ARE
SO SCREWED UP.

18:40.367 --> 18:43.100
- I'M SORRY, RAYMOND.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.333
I'M SORRY, DAD.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.100
- UH, IT'S OKAY.

18:50.100 --> 18:53.600
- IT'S OKAY?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.233
NOW IT'S OKAY?

18:55.233 --> 18:58.533
- WILL YOU GIVE IT UP ALREADY?
IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.300
- WHY DON'T YOU DIP
YOUR PANTS IN CINNAMON

19:00.300 --> 19:01.600
AND MAKE US
SOME FRENCH TOAST?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.900
- WHY DON'T YOU
DIP YOUR PANTS--

19:03.900 --> 19:05.833
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE--
- DIP YOUR PANTS--

19:05.833 --> 19:11.467
- MY PANTS ARE DRY, YOU IDIOT!
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

19:11.467 --> 19:13.833
WHY DON'T YOU GO PUT ON
ONE OF THOSE RECORDS?

19:13.833 --> 19:15.700
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.367
- GOOD IDEA, SISTER.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.567
- WITH PLEASURE, DAD.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.333
- HERE, ROBERT.
THIS IS A NICE ONE.

19:21.333 --> 19:25.067
- THANK YOU, DARLING.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.100
- GREAT, SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH MY CDs NOW?

19:32.100 --> 19:34.000
- YOU TAKE THEM,
YOU LISTEN TO THEM,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.467
YOU MIGHT LIKE THEM.

19:35.467 --> 19:39.333
YOU SHOULD TRY TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THINGS.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.800
- ALL RIGHT.
HERE IT IS.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.633
[scratchy, hissing jazz version
of "Bye Bye Blackbird"]

20:00.000 --> 20:03.733
- NOW THAT'S MUSIC.

20:03.733 --> 20:07.367
[music continues]

20:16.633 --> 20:22.067
- OKAY, NOW THIS IS "TO DADDY
FROM MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY."

20:22.067 --> 20:25.833
- OH.
THANK YOU.

20:25.833 --> 20:29.333
- HEY, WHAT IS THAT?

20:29.333 --> 20:32.400
- IT'S A NEW DICTIONARY.
- OH.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.767
- ISN'T THAT SWEET?

20:33.767 --> 20:35.433
THEY FELT BAD ABOUT
RUINING YOUR OLD ONE.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.167
- HMM.
- IT'S ELECTRONIC.

20:37.167 --> 20:41.900
- [chuckles]

20:41.900 --> 20:45.833
IT'S BETTER.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.833
- AND I LOVE IT.

20:48.833 --> 20:53.400
BUT NOT MORE THAN I LOVE YOU.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.800
AW.
HMM, HMM, HMM.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.700
- WHY DON'T YOU LOOK UP
"FRUITCAKE" IN THERE.

21:01.700 --> 21:06.700
- [laughs] FRUITCAKE
WITH SISSY SAUCE.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.367
- OH, LOOK, MARIE.

21:10.367 --> 21:14.933
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
LEFT IN YOUR STOCKING.

21:14.933 --> 21:19.100
- THANK YOU, DEAR.

21:19.100 --> 21:22.333
"TO MARIE FROM DEBRA."

21:22.333 --> 21:25.533
AW.

21:30.933 --> 21:35.900
OH. THANK YOU, DEBRA.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.267
- YOU LIKE IT?

21:37.267 --> 21:39.167
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,

21:39.167 --> 21:42.767
IT'S NOT A STYLE
I'D EVER WEAR.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.733
NICE TRY, THOUGH.
