29:30.941 --> 29:32.425
In the '’70s,

29:32.460 --> 29:34.117
a journalist called Mary Kenny

29:34.151 --> 29:36.636
was found tangled in the arms
of a former cabinet member

29:36.671 --> 29:38.569
of the Ugandan government.

29:38.604 --> 29:40.951
And Private Eye printed it.

29:40.986 --> 29:43.505
And the phrase
"Ugandan discussions"

29:43.540 --> 29:46.336
quickly took on a more
illicit meaning.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.858
Let'’s just say that Vlad and I

29:50.892 --> 29:54.654
had one or two "Ugandan
discussions" ourselves.

29:54.689 --> 29:57.623

it was some sort of honey trap.

29:59.073 --> 30:01.109
He spent the whole time
thinking the same.

Well,

30:19.645 --> 30:22.544

sort of plutonium plot.

30:22.579 --> 30:23.787
Some years ago.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.894
And the rumor mill thought he'’d
given me the information.

30:26.928 --> 30:29.344
He hadn'’t but I had to
protect my source, so...
