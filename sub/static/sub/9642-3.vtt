WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:07.950
Alex, get out of bed already!

00:07.980 --> 00:09.740
I don't want to be late for Driver's Ed.

00:09.770 --> 00:10.940
Be right there!

00:11.940 --> 00:13.900
Ready.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.239
I hate it when you flash
in places without warning me.

00:16.270 --> 00:17.780
Why do you do that?

00:17.810 --> 00:21.120
Because in the time it would've
taken me to come down the stairs,

00:21.160 --> 00:23.820
I got dressed, brushed my teeth,
and made this bowl of cereal.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.350
You do get you quit
the wizard competition, right?

00:29.390 --> 00:31.450
Pretty soon you're gonna
lose all your powers.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.689
You need to learn how to survive

00:32.729 --> 00:34.460
without using magic for everything you do.

00:34.490 --> 00:36.130
Harper, that's ridiculous.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.300
I don't use magic for everything that I do.

00:38.370 --> 00:39.800
Oh, really?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.370
Do you even know how to zip up
that sweatshirt on your own?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.970
Yes.

00:51.150 --> 00:54.250
There, see?

00:54.280 --> 00:57.490
That is the saddest thing I have ever seen.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.720
Alex, I am serious.
What are you gonna do

01:00.760 --> 01:03.520
when you can't flash in and out of places?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.090
You need to learn how to drive.

01:05.129 --> 01:08.130
Right. Well, let's go
to Driver's Ed.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.760
Yay! I can't wait
to get my license.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.470
Then I can communicate with my
fellow New York City drivers.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.330
"Hey, jerk!
You cut me off!

01:15.370 --> 01:18.100
Pull over, I'm gonna
take you down!"

02:11.390 --> 02:14.850
Hey, Dad. Now that I'm probably
gonna be the family wizard,

02:14.890 --> 02:16.820
I think it's time I get
that family wizard robe

02:16.860 --> 02:19.060
everyone's always talking about.

02:19.090 --> 02:22.560
- Is, uh... Is this it?
- Get out of there.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.230
No! The family wizard robe

02:25.270 --> 02:27.330
is a symbol of power and status

02:27.370 --> 02:29.270
that's handed down through the generations

02:29.300 --> 02:31.200
to the next family wizard.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.410
Now, I understood some
of the words you just said.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.910
And it still makes me think I
should be the one in our family

02:36.940 --> 02:40.050
- to have that robe.
- Yeah, well, I...

02:40.080 --> 02:42.950
I sort of gave it to Justin
when he was in the lead.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.820
I understood all of
the words you just said,

02:45.850 --> 02:47.120
and I did not like them.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.650
Dad, are you kidding me?
I deserve that robe.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.460
Yeah...
Yes, you do.

02:53.490 --> 02:56.290
But it's really special to Justin.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.730
It's gonna be very tough
to get it from him.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.370
We're gonna have to dance
delicately around this subject.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
Dance delicately.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.440
You mean like this?

03:13.210 --> 03:15.150
I don't know how this is gonna
help us get the robe back,

03:15.180 --> 03:17.250
but it sure is fun.

03:19.150 --> 03:21.090
Knock it off!

03:24.090 --> 03:26.690
OK. We gotta butter him up.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.430
Like corn?

03:29.630 --> 03:30.630
Just follow my lead.

03:30.670 --> 03:34.230
Hey, hey, hey!
How you doin'?

03:34.270 --> 03:36.300
There he is!
My favorite son!

03:36.340 --> 03:38.940
Wow. You look
really cool today.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.610
Did you do something new to your hair?

03:41.640 --> 03:43.850
No, I just carefully
messed it up with some hair gel

03:43.880 --> 03:46.180
to make it look, you know,
casually messed up.

03:46.220 --> 03:48.350
Man, that's cool!

03:48.380 --> 03:51.620
That is really, really cool.

03:51.650 --> 03:54.020
You know what else
is cool about you, Justin?

03:54.060 --> 03:56.490
You don't get
super-attached to things.

03:56.530 --> 03:59.260
That is true, I don't get
super-attached to things.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.130
You know, I'm a simple man
of concepts and ideas.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.930
Great.
Here's an idea.

04:04.970 --> 04:08.540
How about we give my second favorite son,

04:08.570 --> 04:11.610
- the family robe.
- What?

04:11.640 --> 04:14.640
- You gave it to me.
- Dad, is this the part

04:14.680 --> 04:16.209
where I start dancing delicately?

04:20.649 --> 04:22.720
I know I gave it to you, Justin,

04:22.750 --> 04:24.820
but that was before you disgraced yourself

04:24.860 --> 04:27.120
by revealing that you were
a wizard and all that.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.760
Disgraced myself?

04:30.800 --> 04:33.630
Are you even lookin' at him?

04:38.370 --> 04:41.300
No, I'm sorry, I'm not
gonna give him the robe.

04:41.340 --> 04:44.310
I haven't lost this competition
yet, and I'm not planning to.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.980
This is my moment,

04:46.010 --> 04:47.450
when I can rise from the ashes of defeat

04:47.480 --> 04:50.880
and take my rightful place
as the Russo family wizard.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.680
- But Justin...
- And you know something?

04:52.720 --> 04:55.850
Yes, I do get
super-attached to things!

05:01.790 --> 05:04.700
Well, that didn't go so well.

05:04.730 --> 05:07.830
And I'm sorry I said he was my favorite.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.200
Don't worry about it, Dad.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.540
To be honest, I've always preferred Mom.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.750
Land sakes, woman!

05:20.780 --> 05:24.220
You're all over the road like a
pat of butter on a hot skillet!

05:24.250 --> 05:25.850
Please don't yell at me,
Mr. Laritate.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.750
It only makes me drive worse.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.160
Teaching Driver's Ed
is not worth the overtime pay.

05:31.890 --> 05:36.430
I'm never gonna be able to afford
matching cowhide seat covers.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.870
Stay between the white lines, Harper.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.130
Oh, right.

05:44.070 --> 05:48.110
- Watch your speed.
- Thanks.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.310
Bus pulling out.

05:51.340 --> 05:56.450
- Sorry!
- All right, that's it.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.420
Make a left and pull over in front
of that restaurant over there.

05:59.450 --> 06:02.760
I need to get something healthy
to eat to calm my nerves.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.760
But, that's a donut shop.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.430
Then I'll get the ones with fruit inside.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.670
Well, we survived.

06:15.700 --> 06:20.110
We can all thank my lucky
life-saving hula girl.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.280
You're next, Alex.

06:22.310 --> 06:23.910
Come on, Leilani.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.350
You deserve one with coconut sprinkles.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.590
Hey, Alex, thanks for the driving tips.

06:34.620 --> 06:35.890
I think they actually helped me.

06:35.930 --> 06:36.890
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.060
That's great, Harper.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.270
Guess I can do some things without magic.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.270
Just because I've used magic as a shortcut

06:45.300 --> 06:46.640
for as long as I can remember.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.870
- Um, Alex...
- Doesn't mean I can't live

06:48.910 --> 06:50.570
a very successful, ordinary life.

06:52.610 --> 06:55.480
We just crashed the car, didn't we?

06:55.510 --> 06:58.550
- We?
- I had to try.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.074

07:09.630 --> 07:12.860
Upon reflection, I realize I
may have acted inappropriately

07:12.900 --> 07:14.900
about the wizard family robe.

07:14.930 --> 07:17.100
Here you go.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.770
Wow, Justin. That is
really big of you.

07:20.810 --> 07:23.010
I know that that's very hard...

07:23.040 --> 07:25.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't need a lecture. Just take it.

07:26.710 --> 07:29.250
Whew! Thank goodness,
he cut me off.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.750
I had no idea where I was
going with that speech.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.990
So, what do you think of the robe, huh?

07:35.020 --> 07:39.220
Doesn't it feel kind of
magic-y, and tingly?

07:39.260 --> 07:41.360
Yeah, I have a chronic body rash,

07:41.390 --> 07:44.930
so most things I wear feel kind of tingly.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.500
- Let's try it out, OK?
- All right.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.630
It's got powers of invisibility,

07:48.670 --> 07:51.570
a chameleon feature, and I even charmed it

07:51.600 --> 07:54.310
to have a never-ending
supply of hoagies

07:54.340 --> 07:55.410
in the right sleeve.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.910
Ah! One hoagie coming up.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.280
Dad, does a hoagie feel like an armpit,

08:01.310 --> 08:03.010
'cause that's all I'm getting.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.180
- What?
- Yeah.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.550
Let me see.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.980
No, Dad!

08:07.020 --> 08:08.720
No, stop.
Dad, that tickles!

08:10.860 --> 08:14.620
Wait. This star
was just glued on.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.860
That is not the Russo family robe.

08:16.890 --> 08:20.600
That's just a regular robe
that's been decorated.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.500
- Where's the real robe?
- I don't know.

08:23.530 --> 08:26.770
But I'm very, very disappointed.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.210
'Cause I was really
looking forward to a hoagie.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.980
- This is really bad, Alex.
- I know.

08:36.010 --> 08:39.010
We've been driving around in this
rolling cow heap all afternoon.

08:39.049 --> 08:40.610
I hope no one saw us.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.120
No, I'm talking about the busted bumper.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.780
Oh, that.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.750
Don't worry, I can fix it that.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.350
No. You're supposed to learn
how to deal with this situation

08:49.390 --> 08:50.420
without magic.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.420
Right.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.760
- Let's make a break for it.
- No, wait!

08:56.860 --> 08:58.630
What people do without magic,

08:58.670 --> 09:00.770
is use honesty to take responsibility

09:00.800 --> 09:02.030
for what they've done.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.740
That's a good one, Harper.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.540
Honesty and responsibility.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.810
Oh, no, but seriously, who should we blame?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.780
Like an innocent bystander or something?

09:13.810 --> 09:15.980
How about that lady?
She looks pretty defenseless.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.020
Hey lady, why'd you do that to our car?

09:19.990 --> 09:21.450
Alex, stop!
That's...

09:23.290 --> 09:25.230
I'm serious.
If you want to stop

09:25.260 --> 09:27.430
relying on magic to
solve all your problems,

09:27.460 --> 09:29.400
you're gonna have to learn
how to tell the truth.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.860
Starting now.

09:36.870 --> 09:41.910
What in the name of
John Wayne's itty bitty feet

09:41.940 --> 09:43.680
happened to my car?!

09:43.710 --> 09:46.880
Mr. Laritate,
I can explain.

09:46.910 --> 09:49.550
Oh. I'm sure you can, Russo.

09:49.580 --> 09:53.590
What kind of crazy lie pie
have you baked up this time?

09:57.160 --> 10:00.800
Actually, Mr. Laritate,
it was all my fault.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.870
I accidentally crashed your car.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.240
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.840
You're actually admitting to
something for once in your life?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.210
Yes.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.580
And you're taking full
responsibility for your actions?

10:21.350 --> 10:22.350
Yes?

10:27.730 --> 10:30.930
Woo doggies!

10:30.960 --> 10:34.260
This is the first airtight confession
I've ever gotten out of you!

10:34.300 --> 10:37.530
Alex Russo has admitted to her crime

10:37.570 --> 10:39.640
completely and unequivocally!

10:39.670 --> 10:41.240
Whoo-hoo!

10:41.270 --> 10:43.610
Prepare to be punished severely
for what you have done.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.810
Honesty feels pretty good, huh?

10:53.140 --> 10:55.280
I never shou have listened to you, Harper.

10:55.310 --> 10:57.580
I could have saved myself a lot of
trouble if I'd just used magic.

10:57.620 --> 10:58.950
You're the one who crashed the car.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.190
I was just trying to help you
learn how to be responsible.

11:01.220 --> 11:04.990
Well, now I'm responsible for cleaning
all the garbage cans at school.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.620
Are you blaming me?

11:06.660 --> 11:10.530
Well, I'm not blaming me, Mr.
Laritate or Leilani, the hula girl.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.570
Well, you have fun
cleaning out garbage cans, Alex.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.500
Try not to dent any of them
while you're at it.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.640
You see?
This is what I get

11:19.670 --> 11:21.440
for helping you out while you were driving.

11:21.470 --> 11:23.140
I didn't ask for your help.

11:23.180 --> 11:27.480
I was helping me.
I wanted to live.

11:27.510 --> 11:28.880
I don't need your help.

11:28.910 --> 11:31.150
I'm gonna pass that drivers
test all by myself.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.350
Well, I don't need you, either.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.120
I can clean all the garbage cans by myself.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.960
And what am I gonna need to do that?

11:37.990 --> 11:40.530
Do I need like a rag or a brush

11:40.560 --> 11:44.530
or, or spray?
No? Fine!

11:49.600 --> 11:52.610
- Not so fast, Justin.
- I'm innocent!

11:53.810 --> 11:56.810
Hey, whoa!
Settle down, settle down.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.910
You haven't been accused of anything yet.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.350
You gave us a fake robe.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.350
Now you've been accused of something.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.350
See, Justin, this robe that you
gave us does not shoot out hoagies.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.850
It only shot out a fish stick.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.320
That's 'cause I shoved it up
there to use it as hoagie bait.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.990
Well, it was working fine when I had it.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.760
So, there's only

12:16.790 --> 12:18.360
Max broke it.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.170
Oh, my gosh.
Dad, I'm so sorry.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.170
I know how much this robe
meant to our family.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.700
You didn't break the robe, Max.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.070
Oh, thank goodness.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.140
What an emotional rollercoaster
this day has been.

12:28.170 --> 12:31.610
I think Justin has
a little explaining to do.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.410
Don't you, Justin?

12:35.220 --> 12:37.120
This robe is a fake.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.050
Sorry.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.220
The real robe got kind of...

12:42.490 --> 12:43.720
...damaged.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.060
I didn't know what to do.
I panicked.

12:47.090 --> 12:50.260
I'll show it to you.
But just don't freak out.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.900
- OK.
- OK.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.330
Don't worry.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.630
Look, after all these years,
I think I've seen

12:55.670 --> 12:58.440
just about everything that
there is to see with you kids...

12:58.470 --> 13:01.770
No!

13:11.150 --> 13:14.450
What happened?!

13:17.360 --> 13:19.990
I don't know.
 It just...

13:20.030 --> 13:23.430
It was fine one day,

13:23.460 --> 13:26.370
and then I came home
and it was just like this.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.070
Unfortunately, it's a mystery

13:28.100 --> 13:30.070
that will never be solved.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.510
Oh!

13:31.540 --> 13:34.210
OK, OK.
Not a problem.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.340
I just remembered,
there's a security Robe-Cam

13:37.380 --> 13:40.910
inside every wizard robe
that records everything.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.110
Wait, what?

13:42.150 --> 13:45.120
We'll find it, we'll play it back...

13:45.150 --> 13:47.520
No, we don't need to find
anything. Disasters happen.

13:47.550 --> 13:48.890
Ah, here it is.

13:55.190 --> 13:57.360
Hey, Justin.

13:57.390 --> 14:00.930
It looks like you are gonna
win the wizard competition,

14:00.970 --> 14:06.000
so I'm gonna pass down
the family robe to you now.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.340
- What an honor.
- Fits good.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.380
Dad, thank you.

14:15.410 --> 14:19.150
I have finished my oil painting.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.420
Coconut cream pies are done.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.730
This is a box of mud.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.500
Now. Remember, Justin...

14:38.540 --> 14:41.910
The robe has been in our family
for a hundred generations.

14:41.940 --> 14:45.080
So you gotta take real good care of it.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.050
I'll take good care of it.
You can count on me.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080
- OK.
- OK.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.750
Hello, handsome.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.220
What's your name?

14:58.260 --> 15:00.920
Family Wizard.
That's right, yes.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.360
These are real diamonds, actually.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.200
Oh, no, no, no, no!

15:42.740 --> 15:45.600
What have I done?!

16:13.600 --> 16:15.330
Good work, Russo.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.000
You may not believe this,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.440
but I'm actually glad you crashed my car.

16:19.470 --> 16:20.970
Why?

16:21.010 --> 16:23.140
Were you getting tired of all
the pointing and laughing?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.980
No. It's given you a chance

16:27.010 --> 16:29.350
to take responsibility for your actions,

16:29.380 --> 16:31.150
and pay your debt to society.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.680
Really?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.150
So you're not mad anymore?

16:36.190 --> 16:37.490
Nope.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.790
You and I now have a clean slate.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.690
Wow.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.260
She was right.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.160
I did this all on my own, without any ma...

16:46.200 --> 16:47.560
...special help.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.700
I am going to be OK.

16:51.740 --> 16:54.240
I have no idea what any of that meant.

16:54.270 --> 16:56.140
Then again, I don't understand

16:56.170 --> 16:58.310
most of the hippety-hoppity
young'un lingo

16:58.340 --> 17:00.510
you kids use these days.

17:00.550 --> 17:04.450
Nonetheless, I'm glad
I finally got through to you.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.880
No, you didn't get through
to me, Mr. Laritate.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.819
My friend Harper did.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.990
I'll have to try to find
a way to thank Harper.

17:12.020 --> 17:16.530
Hey, she's about to take
her drivers test right now.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.630
I know a way that you could thank her.

17:18.660 --> 17:23.030
How about you let her use your lucky
hula girl for, you know, luck?

17:23.069 --> 17:25.970
By golly, you're right!

17:26.000 --> 17:27.599
Come on, Leilani.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.240
We've got to catch this stagecoach
before it leaves the luau.

17:31.270 --> 17:33.610
That one was for you, girl.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.350
So? How am I doing?

17:43.390 --> 17:46.190
Well, I think your lucky hula girl there

17:46.230 --> 17:50.100
is shaking back and forth from fright.

17:50.130 --> 17:53.770
Well, you seem calm.
I guess that's a good sign.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.200
I'm a professional DMV examiner.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.540
It's my job to mask my horror.

17:59.970 --> 18:01.310
Truthfully, though,

18:01.340 --> 18:03.540
I'm screaming like a little girl inside.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.580
That's what I was afraid of.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.550
Psst, Harper.
Over here.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.750
What are you doing here?

18:14.790 --> 18:17.960
My job.
I have to be here.

18:17.990 --> 18:20.060
I know I'm using magic, and I shouldn't be,

18:20.090 --> 18:22.300
but I came here to help you pass your test.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.060
I know how much it means to you.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.530
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Thank you.

18:27.570 --> 18:29.770
Most people act like I don't even exist.

18:33.310 --> 18:37.280
Look out for that biker!

18:37.310 --> 18:39.980
All right, that's good,
Harper, that's good.

18:40.010 --> 18:41.580
A little bit to your left.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.250
Follow my hips.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.260
You're such a good friend for doing this.

18:50.290 --> 18:53.700
That's very nice of you to say so.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.740
Hey, Justin, there you are.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.480
Dad, I'm really sorry.

19:06.510 --> 19:10.180
I just got so excited
with the robe, that I...

19:10.220 --> 19:11.480
What are you doing?

19:11.520 --> 19:15.350
I showed the Robe-Cam video
to the wizard robe tailor.

19:15.390 --> 19:16.650
What did he say?

19:16.690 --> 19:21.490
He said, "That's hilarious.
Let me see it again!"

19:21.530 --> 19:23.590
We watched it like, eight times.

19:23.630 --> 19:28.430
But then he gave me this magic washtub.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.470
Oh.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.800
Ta-da.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.040
It worked.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.200
It's just as I remember it

19:36.240 --> 19:38.340
from the 30 seconds I had it.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.680
Since this robe means
so much to you, Justin,

19:41.710 --> 19:44.110
why don't you hold onto it
until the competition?

19:44.150 --> 19:48.050
Really?
Thanks, Dad.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.360
I can't.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.330
Max...

19:56.360 --> 20:00.400
The robe belongs to
the Russo family wizard.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.440
So long as you're so far ahead
in the competition,

20:03.470 --> 20:05.570
you deserve this.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.380
- Justin, thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.240
I'll take good care of it.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.480
Yeah, you better, because
I plan on making a comeback.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.510
I know.

20:14.550 --> 20:17.880
And if anyone can pull it off, you can.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.320
Thanks, man.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.520
Hey. That was a nice thing
you did there.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.990
Thank you, Dad.

20:27.030 --> 20:29.760
You'd better not return that washtub.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.220
OK, I'm just going to go
and add up your score.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.060
But it doesn't look good.

21:01.630 --> 21:04.030
Alex, why did you help me?

21:04.060 --> 21:07.400
Because I was wrong for being mad at you.

21:07.430 --> 21:10.270
You were just trying to help me
live my life without magic,

21:10.300 --> 21:14.610
and you were right.
I'm gonna be OK without it.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.740
But you used magic to be here right now.

21:16.780 --> 21:20.110
You make it so hard
to build a mushy moment.

21:21.350 --> 21:23.350
I have your results, Miss Finkel.

21:25.490 --> 21:29.360
Now, I don't know if it's because
you called me your friend,

21:29.390 --> 21:32.360
or maybe it's just the
near-death experience talking,

21:32.400 --> 21:37.600
- but I've decided to pass you.
- Oh, my gosh!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.630
Good job, Harper!
You did it.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.340
Thanks to you!

21:41.370 --> 21:44.070
I'd so hug you right now,
but you're so tiny.

21:44.110 --> 21:48.010
Tiny? I'll have you know I'm
the tallest one in my family.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.900
Oh, my gosh. I wouldld have
never passed without your help.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.870
I need magic more than you do.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.540
Weird turn of events, huh?

22:00.570 --> 22:03.540
Alex, I'm gonna hug you right now.

22:07.810 --> 22:10.010
Just get big, please.

22:15.350 --> 22:16.550
OK, new plan.

22:16.590 --> 22:19.220
We're gonna keep using magic
as long as you have it.

22:19.260 --> 22:20.860
OK, but only for important things.

22:20.890 --> 22:22.890
Right.
Important things.

22:22.930 --> 22:25.260
Is flashing home an important thing?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.360
Yes, because you barely passed,

22:27.400 --> 22:29.260
and there's no way I'm
letting you drive us home.
