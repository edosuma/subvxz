00:00.063 --> 00:02.059
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:02.118 --> 00:04.853
- Get out of the car.
- It's me.

00:04.954 --> 00:06.622
How do you expect me

00:06.723 --> 00:09.491
to have a relationship with
you under the circumstances?

00:10.253 --> 00:12.254
Norma never has to know I'm here.

00:12.355 --> 00:13.589
You're my son.

00:13.690 --> 00:15.424
Are you okay?

00:15.525 --> 00:18.727
My lung capacity has
diminished, like, a lot.

00:18.795 --> 00:20.396
I don't think you need to go to school.

00:20.497 --> 00:22.164
You'd be okay with that?

00:22.265 --> 00:23.699
I don't think school's been good for you.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.568
Ah!

00:25.669 --> 00:27.336
What's your name?

00:27.437 --> 00:29.071
Annika Johnson.

00:29.172 --> 00:30.739
I'm looking for a room
for a couple of nights.

00:30.807 --> 00:32.441
Do you have anything available?

00:32.542 --> 00:34.310
So why are you visiting us?

00:34.411 --> 00:36.645
Um, I work at parties.

00:36.713 --> 00:38.614
You seem like a nice girl.

00:38.715 --> 00:41.016
I am.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.685
Why do you do this kind of work?

00:42.786 --> 00:44.453
Once you start touching somebody's body,

00:44.554 --> 00:46.422
the rest of it just kind of melts away.

00:46.523 --> 00:48.591
It's just sex.

00:48.692 --> 00:51.227
Sex is sex. We all need it.

00:51.328 --> 00:53.729
Turn down that road up ahead.

01:15.819 --> 01:18.120
Hello? It's Norma Bates.

01:18.221 --> 01:20.022
I have some fresh towels here for you,

01:20.123 --> 01:22.024
and I want to check your
bathroom window shade

01:22.125 --> 01:23.459
to make sure it's working.

01:34.404 --> 01:36.305
Hello?

02:14.311 --> 02:17.246
This is covering both nights.

02:17.347 --> 02:19.248
I thought the Wi-Fi was free.

02:19.349 --> 02:20.582
It is.

02:20.684 --> 02:22.451
Well, why is it listed on the bill?

02:22.552 --> 02:25.554
To show that you received it,
but you see there's no charge.

02:29.326 --> 02:31.226
Have you seen the girl
in number four today?

02:31.328 --> 02:32.961
She isn't in her room.

02:33.063 --> 02:34.296
I saw her car here.

02:34.364 --> 02:37.132
Maybe she got up early and went hiking.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.568
She doesn't strike me as a hiker.

02:44.441 --> 02:46.108
Ahem.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.644
Just sign there if it's all okay.

03:04.194 --> 03:05.928
Norman?

03:06.029 --> 03:07.663
I'm here, mother.

03:12.471 --> 03:13.738
What is that?

03:13.839 --> 03:15.439
She's a baby goat.

03:15.541 --> 03:17.542
I got her from the artisan
cheese farm in the village.

03:17.643 --> 03:19.343
Oh...

03:19.444 --> 03:21.846
She's gonna be so beautiful when I'm done.

03:21.947 --> 03:23.481
She was in their trash.

03:23.582 --> 03:25.182
I cleaned her and froze her.

03:25.284 --> 03:27.118
Please don't tell me you
put that in our freezer.

03:27.219 --> 03:29.587
Well, they have to be frozen
to remove the skin properly.

03:29.688 --> 03:32.290
Well, then I need a large
freezer for down here.

03:32.391 --> 03:33.591
Fine.

03:36.562 --> 03:38.963
Did you see the girl in room four today?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.868
No.

03:43.969 --> 03:45.636
Why?

03:45.737 --> 03:47.805
Um, it's just, um,

03:47.873 --> 03:50.474
her bed hasn't been slept in.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.343
I went down there to make sure that

03:52.411 --> 03:54.211
her window shade was working,

03:54.313 --> 03:58.215
and clearly she hasn't slept in her bed.

03:58.317 --> 04:01.485
Her car's still there,
so I... Just seems odd.

04:01.587 --> 04:03.854
Did you see her at all last night?

04:03.956 --> 04:07.258
No. No, I didn't.

04:07.359 --> 04:08.693
Okay.

04:11.496 --> 04:12.797
Well, um...

04:15.367 --> 04:17.767
Finish up with your goat,

04:17.869 --> 04:21.505
and, come on, get back down to your job.

04:21.607 --> 04:23.541
And you have to stay on
top of your school work.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.443
Don't... Don't make me feel
sorry that I let you home school.

04:25.544 --> 04:26.677
Okay.

04:26.778 --> 04:29.180
- Okay?
- Okay, mother.

04:34.353 --> 04:36.721
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.356
About what?

04:38.457 --> 04:40.992
The girl in room four. I'm sure she's fine.

04:45.564 --> 04:47.298
Yeah.

05:05.914 --> 05:09.206
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -

05:12.958 --> 05:15.292
We're gonna have to
trench this whole perimeter

05:15.394 --> 05:16.560
and lay down rebar.

05:23.568 --> 05:25.236
Hey, morning.

05:26.938 --> 05:28.606
Good morning.

05:28.674 --> 05:30.775
Hey, boy, hey.

05:30.876 --> 05:32.343
Whose dog is this?

05:32.557 --> 05:34.758
Oh, that's mine. He's Rex.

05:34.826 --> 05:37.627
He's a great guard dog.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.262
Hey, I was thinking,

05:39.363 --> 05:40.764
maybe we could rig up a pump to the lake,

05:40.832 --> 05:42.332
you know, for irrigation,

05:42.433 --> 05:44.334
you know, given we don't get caught.

05:44.435 --> 05:46.469
What do you think? You ever
hook up anything like that?

05:46.571 --> 05:48.772
Yeah, I've hooked up every
kind of shit. imaginable.

05:49.941 --> 05:51.441
Damn, I'm glad he's here.

05:51.542 --> 05:53.710
Might actually get this thing going now.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.378
All right, I'll go get the equipment.

05:55.479 --> 05:56.780
I'll start measuring this shit out.

05:56.848 --> 05:57.981
Come on, buddy.

06:01.586 --> 06:03.820
Hey, thanks for letting me stay.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.456
Has that girl come back yet?

06:39.523 --> 06:42.692
I actually haven't seen her all day.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.861
Why do you have groceries?

06:44.962 --> 06:46.563
Oh, I was on my way up to the house.

06:46.631 --> 06:48.565
I... I've just been so worried about her.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.367
I don't even know why.

06:50.434 --> 06:51.701
When is the last time you saw her?

06:51.802 --> 06:52.936
Last night.

06:53.004 --> 06:54.804
She was going somewhere in town.

06:54.906 --> 06:56.706
Norman drove with her
to show her where it was.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.976
Norman went with her last night?

07:00.077 --> 07:01.912
Well, yeah, he was just riding along.

07:02.013 --> 07:04.514
He had to go pick up a
new thermostat in town.

07:13.624 --> 07:16.226
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

07:16.294 --> 07:18.528
I really don't think it was a
big deal that he went with her.

07:18.629 --> 07:19.996
I think he was just trying to help.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.736
Are you okay?

07:26.837 --> 07:28.605
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:28.706 --> 07:31.741
I just remembered I got to
put these groceries away.

07:31.842 --> 07:35.378
I-I bought ice cream. It's gonna melt.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.018
Norman?

07:42.119 --> 07:44.754
Norman!

07:44.855 --> 07:46.990
What?

07:47.091 --> 07:49.292
Why did you lie to me?

07:49.393 --> 07:50.961
Hm?

07:51.028 --> 07:53.029
Why didn't you tell me that
you drove with that woman

07:53.130 --> 07:55.332
into town last night?

07:55.399 --> 07:57.400
She asked me to drive her car back.

07:57.501 --> 07:59.436
I know you don't like me
driving without a license.

07:59.503 --> 08:00.537
Norman, do not screw with me.

08:00.604 --> 08:02.539
I'm not.

08:02.606 --> 08:05.208
You were the last person seen
with her, and now she's gone.

08:05.309 --> 08:07.210
All I did was drive with her to this bar.

08:07.311 --> 08:09.879
Okay, did she tell you why
she was going to the bar,

08:09.981 --> 08:10.914
who she was meeting?

08:11.015 --> 08:12.615
I need details, Norman.

08:12.683 --> 08:14.484
It couldn't... Just try
to remember anything.

08:14.585 --> 08:15.952
She just said she was meeting a friend.

08:16.053 --> 08:17.754
Yeah, she said she was
going to be drinking,

08:17.855 --> 08:19.322
and maybe she shouldn't drive home.

08:19.423 --> 08:21.224
You know, that her friend
could bring her home,

08:21.325 --> 08:23.293
and then I just offered to
drive her car back for her.

08:23.394 --> 08:24.561
That's all.

08:24.662 --> 08:26.396
Did she seem okay? Was she upset?

08:26.497 --> 08:27.764
Was she worried about anything?

08:27.865 --> 08:30.600
She was a little anxious
maybe. I don't know.

08:30.701 --> 08:32.534
She was very dressed up.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.741
Okay.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.577
Come on.

08:40.678 --> 08:42.645
We're gonna get in the car,
and you're gonna show me

08:42.712 --> 08:44.714
everything that happened, right now.

08:46.517 --> 08:48.551
You shouldn't have gotten
in the car with her, Norman.

08:48.652 --> 08:49.986
Why?

08:50.087 --> 08:51.721
Because you can't keep getting into cars

08:51.822 --> 08:52.922
with questionable women.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.457
- Questionable?
- Slutty.

08:54.558 --> 08:55.792
Oversexed. Crazy.

08:55.893 --> 08:58.695
- You're being ridiculous.
- I'm not!

08:58.796 --> 09:01.331
I mean, look what happened
with Blaire Watson.

09:04.301 --> 09:06.236
I mean, you got in the
car with her that night,

09:06.337 --> 09:07.971
and it caused you a world of trouble.

09:11.642 --> 09:13.343
I don't know why,

09:13.444 --> 09:17.947
but unhinged women seem drawn to you.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.983
She's not unhinged, okay?

09:20.084 --> 09:22.218
She's a very nice girl.

09:22.319 --> 09:23.820
Maybe just a little troubled,

09:23.921 --> 09:25.688
but I was only trying to be helpful,

09:25.756 --> 09:27.257
and I needed to be in town anyway

09:27.358 --> 09:28.591
to pick up that new thermostat.

09:28.659 --> 09:31.327
Troubled how?

09:31.395 --> 09:33.997
I-I think she was a call
girl of some kind, you know?

09:34.098 --> 09:36.299
She told me she came into
town to work at a party...

09:36.400 --> 09:38.701
A party with rich men.

09:38.769 --> 09:40.370
She told you that?

09:40.471 --> 09:42.405
I'm not a little boy, mother.

09:42.506 --> 09:45.575
No, I'm not saying that you are, I just...

09:45.676 --> 09:48.445
I mean, why would she...

09:48.512 --> 09:50.413
Why would she tell you that?

09:53.289 --> 09:55.290
Come on, I'll show you where the bar is.

10:08.395 --> 10:10.163
I'm gonna go see if they
can tell me anything.

10:10.264 --> 10:11.264
I'll come with you.

10:11.365 --> 10:13.266
No, you stay here.

10:13.367 --> 10:14.567
Okay.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.943
Why did you say "was"?

10:22.380 --> 10:23.534
"Was" what?

10:25.016 --> 10:28.519
You said, "She was a nice woman,

10:28.620 --> 10:30.187
and troubled."

10:32.924 --> 10:34.424
Stop it, mother.

11:23.541 --> 11:26.276
- So?
- They don't know anything.

11:26.377 --> 11:28.145
They don't remember if she was there.

11:28.246 --> 11:30.247
Let's just go home.

11:38.256 --> 11:40.958
I don't know how long I
can keep doing this, Norman.

11:43.928 --> 11:45.429
Doing what?

11:50.568 --> 11:51.935
Nothing.

11:52.036 --> 11:53.403
Never mind.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.472
Let's just go home.

12:09.988 --> 12:11.555
I'm headed out.

12:11.656 --> 12:14.258
I'll see y'all tomorrow.
We'll go over the plans

12:14.359 --> 12:16.426
and figure out what lumber we need to buy.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.296
What's your hurry, man? Grab a beer.

12:21.599 --> 12:23.166
I got to head home.

12:23.268 --> 12:25.469
I got a bunch of stuff
I got to take care of.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.143
Oh, shit.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.915
Easy, boy.

12:38.016 --> 12:39.116
Come here!

12:39.217 --> 12:40.317
Hey! Come here, boy.

12:41.986 --> 12:43.086
Hey!

12:43.187 --> 12:44.087
Hey, Rex, come on!

12:45.189 --> 12:46.390
shit!

12:55.099 --> 12:57.000
I'm gonna turn in.

12:57.101 --> 12:58.969
Good night.

13:14.519 --> 13:17.521
I have something I need
to tell you, mother.

13:19.490 --> 13:20.891
What is it?

13:20.992 --> 13:23.226
I-I know you worry about me a lot,

13:23.328 --> 13:25.562
and I don't want you to.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.131
You know, I really feel like
everything's under control.

13:28.232 --> 13:31.301
The school work, the motel,
and I'm really okay...

13:33.404 --> 13:35.906
and I'm going to be dating Emma.

13:38.142 --> 13:39.242
You are?

13:39.344 --> 13:41.078
Mm-hmm.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.451
When did this happen?

13:47.552 --> 13:49.453
Just felt like the right time.

13:49.554 --> 13:51.021
I'm 18 now,

13:51.122 --> 13:53.357
time to start laying some foundation.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.528
So you're... You're okay with it?

14:04.202 --> 14:05.502
Yeah.

14:09.507 --> 14:11.308
I am.

14:24.022 --> 14:26.023
Okay, mother.

14:26.124 --> 14:28.525
- Nighty-night.
- Night, honey.

14:54.216 --> 14:55.783
I read once

14:55.851 --> 14:58.252
that ramen is the worst kind of date food.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.755
Probably due to all the slurping.

15:09.064 --> 15:10.831
I think it's really nice
that you and your mom

15:10.932 --> 15:12.066
are so worried about her.

15:16.972 --> 15:18.839
You know, we can do the date another night

15:18.940 --> 15:20.274
if this is all too much.

15:20.342 --> 15:22.176
No.

15:22.244 --> 15:24.979
Mother's the one who's really worried.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.114
She was upset I drove the car back.

15:27.215 --> 15:29.183
I shouldn't have said you
drove into town with her.

15:29.251 --> 15:30.885
I wasn't thinking.

15:30.986 --> 15:32.820
It's not your fault, Emma.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.926
I want you to know that

15:38.994 --> 15:41.996
I don't tell your mom everything.

15:44.232 --> 15:46.233
Like, the stuff that goes on between us...

15:48.904 --> 15:50.371
It stays between us.

15:56.111 --> 15:57.344
I better go.

15:57.446 --> 16:00.781
I got to do something before.

16:00.882 --> 16:02.983
I'll see you for our date tonight, okay?

16:03.085 --> 16:05.019
I'll be here.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.010
Hey.

16:30.112 --> 16:32.980
Hey.

16:33.081 --> 16:34.682
You need something?

16:34.783 --> 16:37.918
I live, um, over the hill...

16:40.922 --> 16:42.389
South face.

16:44.126 --> 16:45.960
You know, we're neighbors.

16:47.229 --> 16:49.964
Oh.

16:50.065 --> 16:53.868
I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors

16:53.969 --> 16:56.337
over the hill on the South face.

16:56.404 --> 16:58.639
Well, you do.

16:58.740 --> 17:00.741
So what's up?

17:09.050 --> 17:11.886
I'm looking for my pet dog.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.657
You know, he's a mutt.

17:17.759 --> 17:22.262
I let him out last night,
but he never came back.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.636
Have you seen him?

17:28.737 --> 17:31.105
No.

17:31.173 --> 17:33.908
No?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.877
- Haven't seen him.
- Haven't seen him.

17:36.978 --> 17:38.379
Hm.

17:38.446 --> 17:40.781
Well, you be sure to let me know if you do.

17:40.882 --> 17:42.183
Yeah, if we see your dog,

17:42.284 --> 17:44.084
we'll stop everything and let you know.

17:46.188 --> 17:48.455
I'm Caleb. This is my son, Dylan.

17:50.292 --> 17:51.926
And you are?

17:54.696 --> 17:57.097
Chick.

17:57.199 --> 17:58.799
I'm Chick Hogan.

17:58.900 --> 18:03.070
I live on the other side of the hill.

18:03.171 --> 18:06.040
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by, Chick.

18:13.315 --> 18:16.350
Are you planting tomatoes?

18:18.186 --> 18:19.753
Yeah.

18:19.855 --> 18:20.888
And corn.

18:20.956 --> 18:23.090
And green beans.

18:23.191 --> 18:25.593
I like green beans.

18:25.694 --> 18:28.896
I like green beans too.

18:28.997 --> 18:32.633
Well, you know that
last year the tomato crop

18:32.734 --> 18:35.336
was wiped out, yeah?

18:35.403 --> 18:37.104
You knew that?

18:37.205 --> 18:39.373
By the DEA.

18:41.042 --> 18:45.145
So lots of opportunity.

19:11.806 --> 19:14.775
She's still not here.

19:14.876 --> 19:16.844
Should we call someone?
Tell the sheriff about it?

19:16.912 --> 19:19.647
No, no, no, no, no. I
don't want to seem crazy.

19:19.714 --> 19:23.317
She's... I mean, she's... she's just...

19:23.418 --> 19:25.986
probably with friends or something.

19:26.087 --> 19:28.689
Let's just give it another day.

19:31.092 --> 19:33.360
Have you thought about looking in her room?

19:33.461 --> 19:35.362
For what?

19:37.699 --> 19:39.767
Maybe something in there
would give us an idea

19:39.834 --> 19:41.902
of where she's gone.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.755
It's so funny how people
leave their things.

20:01.856 --> 20:03.757
There's such an energy in it,

20:03.858 --> 20:06.260
like the person's still present
somehow in the animation.

20:06.361 --> 20:07.261
Emma, please.

20:07.362 --> 20:08.762
Sorry.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.299
Oh.

20:16.037 --> 20:17.738
What line of work is this woman in?

20:17.839 --> 20:19.306
I think it's obvious.

20:33.121 --> 20:34.955
What's the Arcanum Club?

20:35.056 --> 20:38.659
It's a hunting club, I think.

20:38.760 --> 20:39.994
Very exclusive.

20:40.095 --> 20:41.695
High buy-in, old school.

20:41.796 --> 20:43.697
My dad does some taxidermy for them.

20:43.798 --> 20:46.000
- It's around here?
- I'm not sure.

20:46.067 --> 20:47.801
My dad never talked about it.

20:47.902 --> 20:50.304
I always got a feeling he
didn't like something about it,

20:50.405 --> 20:53.207
- but needed the job.
- Why?

20:53.308 --> 20:55.309
This is an invitation for tonight.

21:00.181 --> 21:03.784
Emma, please don't say
anything about this to Norman.

21:05.353 --> 21:07.087
Okay.

21:20.869 --> 21:22.202
Norma.

21:29.444 --> 21:30.778
You're leaving?

21:30.879 --> 21:34.014
Yeah, that new house is finally ready.

21:34.115 --> 21:35.215
Oh.

21:35.283 --> 21:37.351
Yeah, uh,

21:37.452 --> 21:41.055
it's amazing how much stuff you
can accumulate in a motel room

21:41.122 --> 21:43.123
over three months.

21:45.093 --> 21:46.393
Oh, here.

21:49.030 --> 21:52.332
And this is for all the time I spent here.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.867
No, no. No, no.

21:53.935 --> 21:55.302
- No, no, no.
- No. No, no, no, no.

21:55.403 --> 21:56.870
Norma, you're gonna take the money.

21:56.938 --> 21:58.105
No. No, you're a family friend.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.139
I am not taking your money.

21:59.207 --> 22:00.874
The bypass is half-paved,

22:00.942 --> 22:03.110
and they're starting cars on
the finished part tomorrow.

22:03.211 --> 22:05.312
You're gonna need it. I'm
not taking no for an answer.

22:14.388 --> 22:15.461
Thank you.

22:19.394 --> 22:23.163
All right. Well, good-bye.

22:23.231 --> 22:25.132
Thank you for everything.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.867
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

22:26.968 --> 22:28.202
Yeah.

22:31.206 --> 22:33.674
So, um...

22:33.775 --> 22:35.676
I don't know, I guess I'll see you around.

22:35.777 --> 22:36.977
Yeah.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.147
Well.

22:43.084 --> 22:44.785
Okay.

22:57.999 --> 22:58.932
Bye.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.234
Bye.

23:20.889 --> 23:24.725
Um, I just wanted to tell you...

23:33.201 --> 23:36.770
I always felt safe when you were here.

23:43.478 --> 23:45.345
Thank you, Norma.

24:08.176 --> 24:09.631
I was just wondering when it was

24:09.732 --> 24:12.066
you realized you wanted to go out with me,

24:12.167 --> 24:15.336
and what was the moment that
put it all in focus for you?

24:18.741 --> 24:22.644
Everything's changing right now, you know?

24:22.745 --> 24:26.080
A lot of things don't make sense,

24:26.181 --> 24:28.750
but we kind of do.

24:31.453 --> 24:33.154
Okay. Cheers.

24:38.260 --> 24:41.329
I just feel like I'm gonna see
this whole other side to you.

24:41.430 --> 24:43.131
What do you mean?

24:43.232 --> 24:46.467
Like, how friends do different things

24:46.568 --> 24:48.569
than people who are dating.

24:59.214 --> 25:01.249
Did you, uh...

25:01.350 --> 25:03.351
Did you and Gunner ever have sex?

25:06.055 --> 25:08.089
Yeah. Is that... Is that weird for you?

25:09.758 --> 25:11.292
Did you feel bad after?

25:13.395 --> 25:15.630
I guess I felt kind of naughty,

25:15.731 --> 25:18.433
but I think you're supposed to.

25:18.534 --> 25:21.302
That's part of the fun.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.404
Why, do you feel bad after sex?

25:26.508 --> 25:27.675
Norman?

25:29.745 --> 25:32.246
No.

25:32.348 --> 25:35.249
Maybe just depends on the person.

25:35.351 --> 25:37.752
You know, sometimes it's, um...

25:37.853 --> 25:41.222
It just feels overwhelming
like it's this other part of me.

25:41.323 --> 25:44.158
Yeah, sex is complicated, you know?

25:44.259 --> 25:46.260
It's supposed to be.
It's not cracking an egg.

25:46.362 --> 25:49.230
It's something of importance.

25:49.331 --> 25:51.699
It's the basis of procreation, you know?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.035
It's kind of magical and heady.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.937
It's not nothing.

25:56.038 --> 25:57.138
No, no.

25:57.239 --> 25:59.240
It's definitely big, I just...

25:59.341 --> 26:02.343
You know, I'm not sure I'd refer
to it using the term "magical."

26:10.052 --> 26:11.152
I love your mom,

26:11.253 --> 26:13.454
but I think she loves you so much

26:13.555 --> 26:16.090
that she can't stand the
thought of you growing up.

26:18.394 --> 26:20.395
So maybe this gives you a feeling that

26:20.496 --> 26:23.097
being an adult, being sexual,

26:23.198 --> 26:24.999
is somehow wrong.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.002
Well, she does the best she can.

26:28.103 --> 26:29.637
We're just close.

26:29.738 --> 26:31.205
Yeah, and you always will be,

26:31.306 --> 26:32.774
but that doesn't mean you can't grow up.

26:36.412 --> 26:38.279
Unless you're Peter Pan.

26:42.718 --> 26:45.253
Do you want to be Peter Pan?

26:48.590 --> 26:50.491
Maybe.

26:50.592 --> 26:52.527
If you'll be Wendy.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.433
Peter and Wendy never got to have sex.

27:03.672 --> 27:05.773
Oh.

27:43.278 --> 27:46.347
How can I help you?

27:46.448 --> 27:48.149
I'm on the list for the party.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.650
Your name?

27:49.751 --> 27:51.752
Annika Johnson.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.190
I need the password.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.292
Uh...

28:01.296 --> 28:03.698
The password.

28:15.811 --> 28:17.812
I don't think I know the password.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.249
You'll need to leave then.

28:41.236 --> 28:42.637
Why do we have to do this?

28:42.738 --> 28:44.438
The guy came
and pissed on our grass.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.173
We're gonna piss on his.

28:46.275 --> 28:48.442
It's important. It sets a tone.

28:48.544 --> 28:50.444
What if he was just looking for his dog?

28:50.546 --> 28:52.613
That ass-clown doesn't have a dog.

28:52.714 --> 28:54.482
He probably just saw the dead one

28:54.583 --> 28:56.584
and used that to throw you off balance.

28:58.587 --> 29:00.588
Now it's time to change things up.

29:09.631 --> 29:11.032
Let's go.

29:28.865 --> 29:30.866
What are you doing here?

29:32.902 --> 29:34.502
Look, we just came over

29:34.604 --> 29:37.472
because I think we
accidentally shot your dog.

29:37.573 --> 29:39.474
He got into a fight with our dog,

29:39.575 --> 29:40.976
and we didn't know.

29:41.077 --> 29:43.411
I don't have a dog.

29:43.512 --> 29:46.381
Look, you gonna invite us in?

29:46.482 --> 29:47.515
Todo Bien?

29:47.617 --> 29:50.819
Take Sinoh and go inside.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.691
Hm?

30:14.377 --> 30:16.845
Man, you got a lot of guns.

30:16.946 --> 30:19.547
Define "a lot."

30:19.649 --> 30:21.349
Well, it means more than a few.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.784
That's right.

30:22.885 --> 30:24.886
I have more than a few guns.

30:24.987 --> 30:27.455
Speaking of guns,

30:27.556 --> 30:30.659
you shouldn't be shooting
off guns around here.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.294
It attracts too much attention.

30:32.395 --> 30:33.662
He didn't fire a gun. I did.

30:33.763 --> 30:35.497
Yeah, you did.

30:35.598 --> 30:38.066
You know, it just... It steps on

30:38.167 --> 30:40.302
the peaceful environment that we have here.

30:40.403 --> 30:43.305
It rattles Mother Nature.

30:43.406 --> 30:47.575
You understand that, don't you, Dylan?

30:47.677 --> 30:49.577
Yeah, sure. We do.

30:49.679 --> 30:51.646
You know, there's rules, right?

30:51.747 --> 30:53.415
We respect the rules.

30:53.516 --> 30:57.686
That's how we respect each other, right?

30:57.787 --> 31:00.855
If we all understand the rules,

31:00.957 --> 31:03.091
then we can coexist.

31:05.494 --> 31:07.595
Isn't that right, Dylan?

31:07.697 --> 31:10.865
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

31:10.967 --> 31:14.302
Good.

31:14.403 --> 31:16.304
How many plants do you guys got?

31:16.405 --> 31:19.474
Honestly, Chick, that's none
of your God damn business.

31:19.575 --> 31:21.910
We're cultivating 99 plants.

31:22.011 --> 31:24.612
It's the medical marijuana limit.

31:29.618 --> 31:33.822
You guys remind me of
these two guys in a book.

31:36.726 --> 31:38.994
You don't have any
rabbits up there, do you?

31:45.901 --> 31:47.802
To rabbits.

31:59.415 --> 32:02.417
Let's go.

32:02.518 --> 32:04.919
Oh, yeah, one more thing...

32:05.021 --> 32:06.788
We are gonna do whatever the hell we want

32:06.889 --> 32:08.656
on our own God damn property.

32:08.758 --> 32:10.592
That includes shooting guns.

32:10.693 --> 32:12.527
All right?

32:12.628 --> 32:14.662
When we all see each other,
we're gonna be neighborly.

32:14.764 --> 32:16.898
We're gonna nod or wave, but
we are not gonna be showing up

32:16.999 --> 32:19.501
on each other's porches
borrowing a cup of sugar.

32:21.537 --> 32:24.806
Okay, there are boundaries,
and we are gonna stay in them.

32:30.713 --> 32:32.047
Let's go.

35:06.624 --> 35:07.924
Norma?

35:07.992 --> 35:09.559
Norma.

35:09.627 --> 35:10.927
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

35:10.995 --> 35:12.429
You need to get out of here right now.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.431
Oh, my... What are you doing here?

35:14.532 --> 35:16.967
What am I doing here?

35:17.068 --> 35:19.469
I was pressing the flesh
with some council members,

35:19.537 --> 35:22.072
and I see a figure sneaking
along in the shadows,

35:22.173 --> 35:24.074
and I followed it, and here you are.

35:24.175 --> 35:25.976
I don't know why, but you
need to get out of here.

35:26.077 --> 35:27.878
No. Do you... look what
is going on inside there.

35:27.979 --> 35:30.380
Do you know what kind of people these are?

35:30.481 --> 35:32.616
Yeah, incredibly wealthy people

35:32.717 --> 35:34.618
doing whatever the hell they feel like.

35:34.719 --> 35:36.920
What does any of this
have to do with you, Norma?

35:37.021 --> 35:39.990
There's a young woman,
she's a guest in my motel.

35:40.091 --> 35:43.026
She's been missing for two nights.

35:43.127 --> 35:45.829
She hasn't been back. She
hasn't slept in the bed.

35:45.930 --> 35:47.397
But all her belongings are still there.

35:47.465 --> 35:49.499
I... I don't get it.

35:49.567 --> 35:51.902
Well, she had an invitation to this party.

35:52.003 --> 35:54.004
She's a... I think she's, uh...

35:54.105 --> 35:55.305
working.

35:59.004 --> 36:00.771
I'm really worried about her.

36:00.839 --> 36:03.007
Could you please just go in and
see if you can see her there?

36:03.108 --> 36:04.875
She's about 5'8", blonde.

36:04.976 --> 36:07.211
She's a really, lovely, lovely girl.

36:07.279 --> 36:09.480
I'm just afraid that she might be dead.

36:12.284 --> 36:14.251
When did you see her last?

36:17.447 --> 36:19.824
Norman was the last person who saw her.

36:19.925 --> 36:22.827
He drove into town with her,

36:22.928 --> 36:25.296
and um...

36:27.899 --> 36:29.467
I haven't seen her since.

36:35.907 --> 36:37.675
Okay, you need to go now.

36:37.776 --> 36:40.277
This is not a good place for you to be.

36:40.379 --> 36:42.780
Then... Then why are you here?

36:44.383 --> 36:47.084
I'm not here for that.

36:47.152 --> 36:49.253
Okay, there's a gate all the way in back.

36:49.321 --> 36:51.255
Sneak right under it and get out right now

36:51.323 --> 36:52.757
before anyone sees you.

36:52.858 --> 36:54.091
- Okay. Okay, okay, but...
- Just go.

36:54.159 --> 36:55.359
It's dangerous for you. Get out.

36:55.427 --> 36:57.128
All right, but her name is Annika Johnson.

36:57.229 --> 36:58.729
- If you could just go and...
- Go!

36:58.797 --> 37:00.331
Okay, okay.

37:48.380 --> 37:49.914
Ow!

38:00.358 --> 38:01.692
I hate you!

38:01.760 --> 38:03.694
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

38:03.762 --> 38:05.896
You stupid piece of shit sign!

38:05.997 --> 38:08.732
I hate you!

38:58.788 --> 39:00.789
Thank you for dinner.

39:00.890 --> 39:02.057
It was fun.

39:08.031 --> 39:09.798
Well, I better get going.

39:09.899 --> 39:12.801
I've got to open up early tomorrow.

39:12.902 --> 39:14.269
Okay.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.086
What?

39:31.187 --> 39:34.089
I, uh... I just don't
want to start something

39:34.190 --> 39:37.626
we can't finish, you know, in front of...

39:37.727 --> 39:39.728
In front of my house, and all.

39:41.364 --> 39:43.732
Yeah, fair enough.

39:43.833 --> 39:47.836
- See you tomorrow then.
- Yeah, you will.

40:32.048 --> 40:34.583
What happened?

40:34.684 --> 40:37.052
I knocked over the Lee
Berman Memorial Bypass sign

40:37.153 --> 40:39.621
with my car.

40:39.689 --> 40:42.958
- On purpose?
- Of course on purpose.

40:43.059 --> 40:45.761
What do you think, I bump
into signs by accident?

40:47.931 --> 40:49.831
What's going on, huh?

40:49.933 --> 40:50.899
Why are you all dressed up?

40:50.967 --> 40:53.001
Why are you dirty?

40:53.069 --> 40:56.805
Because I went to a party, and then...

40:56.906 --> 40:58.807
and then I decided to leave.

40:58.908 --> 41:01.643
- It doesn't matter.
- What party?

41:01.711 --> 41:03.712
It doesn't matter.

41:17.327 --> 41:20.028
You've been through a lot, mother.

41:20.096 --> 41:22.664
No, it was just a bad party.

41:22.732 --> 41:25.968
No, I mean, in the last two years.

41:26.069 --> 41:28.837
I'm a little worried about you.

41:32.108 --> 41:34.209
You're worried about me?

41:34.277 --> 41:36.578
You just...

41:36.646 --> 41:38.379
You seem a little different lately.

41:39.759 --> 41:41.115
Stop worrying.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.621
It's all gonna be good, Mother.

41:55.374 --> 41:56.629
You'll see.
