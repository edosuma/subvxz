WEBVTT

00:10.810 --> 00:11.936
You're late.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.103
There was a problem

00:13.179 --> 00:15.170
with the pulse drills
on Level 4.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.909
They're going to be
here any moment.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.507
l want to make a
good impression.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.780
You're certain
we should be doing this?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.652
Orek will be pleased that
we took the initiative.

00:23.723 --> 00:24.883
Oh. l hope you're right.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.558
Welcome to Telsius.

00:32.631 --> 00:33.599
Thank you.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.691
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.360
This is Commander Tuvok.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.598
We're from the Federation
Starship Voyager.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.549 --> 02:32.416
We have several mines
like this on Earth.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.214
l'm not familiar with Earth.

02:34.287 --> 02:38.087
That's because it's 30,000
light- years from here.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.094
30,342.4, to be exact.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.221
You're a long way from home.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.924
lt's difficult sometimes.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.899
Then l close my eyes and think

02:47.967 --> 02:50.629
of the farm in lndiana,
where l grew up,

02:50.737 --> 02:53.297
and for a moment,
l'm home again.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.966
Shall we get down to business?

02:56.075 --> 02:57.235
Yes.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.971
Uh, we've had a shortage
of dilithium

02:59.045 --> 03:00.239
for the last two months.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.474
lf we can't
replenish our supply,

03:02.549 --> 03:05.109
we may be forced
to suspend work.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.586
Our Chief of Mining
Operations has gone

03:08.655 --> 03:09.781
to the Grenna system...

03:09.856 --> 03:11.517
Yeah, but, um, we
are authorized

03:11.591 --> 03:13.752
to conduct trades
in his absence.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.386
What are you prepared to trade?

03:16.462 --> 03:19.795
l'm afraid the only commodity

03:19.866 --> 03:22.801
we have is, uh, bolomite.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.069
We really don't have
much use for that.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.939
On the contrary, Captain.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.446
Bolomite is used in
omega radiation therapy.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.606
The orphans on Narva...

03:35.682 --> 03:38.207
Orphans?

03:38.284 --> 03:39.945
The settlers
on the Narva Colony

03:40.086 --> 03:42.748
were exposed to toxic levels
of omega radiation.

03:42.822 --> 03:47.384
The entire adult population...
was killed.

03:47.460 --> 03:51.328
We're doing all we can
for the children.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.365
All right.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.594
20 kilotons of dilithium

03:55.702 --> 03:57.465
for an equivalent amount
of bolomite.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.869
We only have ten kilotons left.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.430
Then ten it is.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.804
Captain, l must point out

04:03.876 --> 04:06.538
that dilithium is worth
nearly twice as much

04:06.613 --> 04:08.342
as bolomite.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.881
Tuvok, these people
need our help.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.144
l'm not going to quibble

04:12.218 --> 04:13.310
over a few tons of ore.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.048
Perhaps we should celebrate.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.418
l wish we could, but there's

04:17.490 --> 04:19.286
a neutronic storm
approaching our ship.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.882
We should be
leaving orbit.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.860
Um, give us an hour
to finalize the arrangements.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.524
We'll be waiting
to hear from you.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.399
Before we leave, would it be
possible to tour your facility?

04:30.503 --> 04:32.698
lt's our duty
as Starfleet officers to...

04:32.805 --> 04:35.365
Unfortunately,
the storm won't wait.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.272
Maybe on our next visit.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.948
Live long and prosper.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.948
Oh, this hair
is so uncomfortable.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.287
l find it
aesthetically pleasing.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.353
The negotiations?

04:58.431 --> 04:59.523
lt would've been perfect

04:59.599 --> 05:01.157
if ''Tuvok'' hadn't decided
to improvise.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.495
l was portraying my character

05:02.602 --> 05:04.832
as truthfully as possible.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.439
Once we finish a
transaction, we leave.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.529
ls that clear?

05:08.641 --> 05:09.835
lndeed.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.140
lncoming transmission

05:14.213 --> 05:17.182
for Captain Janeway.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.421
Ready.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.590
This is Captain Janeway.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.394
The bolomite is
ready for transport.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.059
We thank you for
your generosity.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.798
Directive 927 of the
Starfleet General Order:

05:39.906 --> 05:42.136
''Always help those in need.''

05:43.409 --> 05:45.274
Transport complete.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.336
We've enjoyed
meeting you, gentlemen.

05:47.413 --> 05:52.680
Uh, Captain, uh, we haven't
received the dilithium yet.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.379
Oh, the neutronic storm

05:54.454 --> 05:56.945
seems to be interfering
with our transporters.

05:57.023 --> 05:57.955
lf we don't

05:58.057 --> 05:59.115
leave orbit immediately

05:59.192 --> 06:00.489
we will sustain heavy damage.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.324
What about our dilithium?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.626
We'll be back to deliver it
as soon as the storm clears.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.063
Well, how long will that be?

06:07.133 --> 06:08.691
Captain Janeway out.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.592
Let's go.

06:26.352 --> 06:29.321
Computer, activate
the sonic shower.

06:32.291 --> 06:33.519
Oh...

06:33.593 --> 06:35.788
adjust the frequency.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.163
Whew! Computer, deactivate
the sonic shower!

06:54.147 --> 06:55.580
Report.

06:55.648 --> 06:59.311
We've got systems failures
on eight decks, Captain.

06:59.385 --> 07:00.875
That explains why
my sonic shower

07:01.020 --> 07:02.544
was a little
louder than usual.

07:02.622 --> 07:03.816
Make that nine decks.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.548
l've run every
diagnostic l know,

07:05.625 --> 07:07.650
and l can't seem to
isolate the problem.

07:07.727 --> 07:08.716
Gremlins.

07:08.795 --> 07:09.989
Excuse me?

07:10.062 --> 07:12.690
ln the early days
of aviation, engineers blamed

07:12.765 --> 07:15.199
imaginary little creatures
called gremlins

07:15.301 --> 07:17.769
for malfunctions
they could not explain.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.605
Well, one of your gremlins

07:20.706 --> 07:23.300
just paid a visit to
the replicator system.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.575
Tuvok, we saved you a seat.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.522
What's wrong?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.354
Someone has altered
one of my holodeck programs...

07:40.426 --> 07:41.791
again.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.329
Hmm. Are you sure it isn't
just one of these malfunctions?

07:44.397 --> 07:46.160
Everything on the
ship's been affected,

07:46.232 --> 07:47.324
including the holodecks.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.163
The Oracle of K'Tal

07:49.268 --> 07:52.237
isn't programmed
to wear pajamas.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.774
Well, maybe he overslept.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.571
l am not amused by
your practical jokes, Mr. Paris.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.669
Why do you
always think it's me?

08:00.746 --> 08:02.441
Mr. Kim?

08:02.515 --> 08:06.212
Mmm. l'd like to claim credit,
but l'm innocent.

08:06.285 --> 08:09.743
The next time l visit
the holodeck, l expect to find

08:09.822 --> 08:12.950
my program restored
to its original parameters.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.426
l'm telling you, Tuvok,
we didn't do it.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.522
l wonder how the Oracle
would look in a sombrero.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.026
Everybody, stop eating.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.103
Captain, what's wrong?

08:25.204 --> 08:27.434
lf l could have everyone's
attention for a moment.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.771
We found a contaminant
in the replicator system.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.241
lt's nothing serious,
but if any of you

08:32.311 --> 08:34.245
start to feel a little queasy,

08:34.313 --> 08:35.837
report to Sick Bay immediately.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.849
ln the meantime,
the galley is closed.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.250
Wish l hadn't had seconds.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.619
Here.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.125
Well, that explains it.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.203
Well, don't tell me

08:58.271 --> 09:00.000
a simple heating
coil in the stove

09:00.072 --> 09:01.733
is responsible for everything

09:01.841 --> 09:03.638
that's gone wrong this morning.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.904
Any component connected
to the integrated circuitry

09:05.978 --> 09:07.036
can spread
a contaminant.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.411
This isn't Starfleet issue.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.949
Where did it come from?

09:11.017 --> 09:13.508
l obtained it
during a trade.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.644
With whom?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.086
Sister Dala.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.453
''Sister''?

09:18.524 --> 09:20.822
One of the clerics
on Selnia Prime.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.154
Tom and l met her

09:22.228 --> 09:23.695
during our away mission.

09:23.763 --> 09:24.695
She was the one

09:24.764 --> 09:26.755
trying to help
all those poor orphans.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.094
lt's, it's,
it's all in our report.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.667
Did you run a diagnostic
before you

09:29.735 --> 09:30.565
installed it?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.262
Captain to the Bridge.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.838
l'm a little busy now.

09:33.940 --> 09:34.929
Can it wait?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.269
l'm afraid not.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.866
l'll be right back.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.875
One excuse after another.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.887
You're stalling,
and l don't have time for it.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.355
Captain, this is Mr. Orek.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.255
He's Chief of Mining Operations

09:53.326 --> 09:54.759
on Telsius Prime.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.351
A problem, Mr. Orek?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.294
Not if your deliver
our dilithium.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.888
Dilithium?

09:59.999 --> 10:02.832
lt's all clearly documented.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.267
Ten kilotons of bolomite ore

10:05.338 --> 10:08.603
in exchange
for ten kilotons of dilithium.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.046
l think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

10:14.113 --> 10:19.608
One way or another, l intend
to collect what you owe me.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.888
We've enjoyed meeting you,
gentlemen.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.086
Uh, Captain,
uh, we haven't received

10:29.161 --> 10:30.128
the dilithium yet.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.824
Oh, the neutronic storm
seems to be interfering

10:32.898 --> 10:34.092
with our transporters.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.157
lf we don't leave orbit
immediately,

10:36.268 --> 10:38.065
we will sustain
heavy damage.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.161
What about our dilithium?

10:40.272 --> 10:43.298
We'll be back to deliver it
as soon as the storm clears.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.275
Do you still deny
you made the trade?

10:47.346 --> 10:49.541
That woman isn't me.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.843
Who is she, then?

10:50.916 --> 10:52.110
Well, she's
obviously an impostor.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.347
l have transmission logs,
transport records,

10:55.421 --> 10:57.548
scans of your shuttlecraft.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.989
l have never been
to your planet, Mr. Orek,

11:00.059 --> 11:02.027
aboard Voyager
or any other vessel.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.926
Our ship's logs
will confirm what

11:04.030 --> 11:05.224
the Captain's been telling you.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.765
And how do l know
they're authentic records?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.301
How do we know your
records are authentic?

11:10.369 --> 11:12.997
You think l falsified data?

11:13.105 --> 11:15.073
Why would l do that?

11:15.141 --> 11:16.699
Perhaps to extort
dilithium from us.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.800
l'm not the thief here.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.573
We are not questioning
your integrity, Mr. Orek.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.547
lt does appear
you've been cheated,

11:23.616 --> 11:25.811
but not by me or
anyone on my crew.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.479
How naive do you think l am?

11:28.554 --> 11:31.250
First, you prey upon
the sympathy of my miners

11:31.323 --> 11:32.415
by telling them
stories

11:32.491 --> 11:33.958
about poor,
orphaned children.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.529
Now you try to convince me
you're the victims here.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.861
Did you say ''orphaned children''?

11:40.933 --> 11:42.867
A despicable tactic.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.732
Will you excuse me
for a minute, please?

11:47.807 --> 11:50.105
We're not finished!

11:52.478 --> 11:54.412
Neelix.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.347
Captain, we're making
real progress with the...

11:57.416 --> 11:58.678
Never mind that.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.685
Tell me more
about this cleric

12:00.753 --> 12:02.778
who gave you
the heating coil.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.288
Uh, Sister Dala?

12:04.356 --> 12:06.449
What do you want to know?

12:06.525 --> 12:07.890
Everything.

12:08.027 --> 12:11.053
Well, Tom and l met her
during our away mission.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.327
We were on a small planetoid
in the Wyanti system,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.493
searching for a spore
the Doctor wanted

12:16.602 --> 12:18.297
to grow
antiviral proteins with.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.339
l tell you, Neelix,
when l first joined Starfleet,

12:21.407 --> 12:22.840
l knew it was gonna

12:22.908 --> 12:25.376
be one glamorous
adventure after another,

12:25.444 --> 12:28.277
but l never dreamed that
l'd have the opportunity

12:28.347 --> 12:30.338
to go on
a mold- hunting expedition.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.180
l'm detecting traces of glamour

12:33.252 --> 12:34.685
in this direction.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.847
Please, go no further.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.049
This is our sanctuary.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.922
Our scans didn't
detect anyone

12:40.993 --> 12:42.255
down here.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.920
Our sect is a solitary one.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.429
We dampen our life signs

12:45.498 --> 12:47.966
to protect the privacy
of our meditations.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.365
We're terribly sorry
if we've disturbed you.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.267
Begin the cleansing.

12:56.575 --> 13:00.011
Olat mal pri,
mal pra, mal prolat,

13:00.079 --> 13:04.277
olate kal mi,
kal mal, kal molat.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.477
l hope we
haven't committed

13:06.552 --> 13:08.520
a serious transgression.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.521
The transgression was ours.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.183
We should have
guarded the sanctuary

13:13.259 --> 13:14.749
more carefully.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.591
The Deities will be angry.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.891
Come on, Neelix.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.465
We'd better get
out of the way.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.795
Of... of course.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.163
Our sincere apologies.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.430
l- if there's anything
we can do...

13:25.538 --> 13:30.339
Forgive me, but
you look familiar.

13:30.409 --> 13:34.675
l don't think that
we've ever met before.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.874
Do you see it?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.550
Yes.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.151
You bear
a striking resemblance

13:44.223 --> 13:46.953
to our Redeemer of Light.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.756
l'm flattered.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.423
Each spring, we make
a pilgrimage to Narva

13:52.498 --> 13:54.591
in his honor,
to help the orphans.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.194
Well, that's a very
worthy cause.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.238
lt is.

14:00.339 --> 14:05.276
Unfortunately, we have no food
to bring them this year.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.344
Why not?

14:06.412 --> 14:08.004
A blight infected

14:08.080 --> 14:10.014
our hydroponic pods.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.277
The crop was destroyed.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.514
Maybe we could replicate
some food for you.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.988
We bestow charity on others.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.854
The Deities forbid us

14:19.925 --> 14:21.790
from accepting it ourselves.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.294
How about a trade?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.795
Yeah. Good idea.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.764
You must have something
that we can use.

14:26.832 --> 14:28.891
That way, you wouldn't
be accepting charity,

14:29.068 --> 14:30.660
and the Deities
would have nothing

14:30.769 --> 14:32.031
to get angry about.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.675
Your heart is as kind
as your face.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.239
May the Deities
bless you.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.046
That's when they

14:47.119 --> 14:48.848
gave you the heating coil?

14:48.921 --> 14:50.183
lt was going to take a while

14:50.256 --> 14:51.951
to replicate the supplies
they needed,

14:52.091 --> 14:53.854
so we invited them back
to the Flyer.

14:53.926 --> 14:54.950
That's when
they must have

14:55.094 --> 14:56.288
gotten access to our systems.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.624
Captain?

14:57.696 --> 14:59.459
Did you leave either of them

14:59.531 --> 15:00.725
alone at any point?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.095
l don't think so.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.727
Uh, after we ate,
Tom took Brother Mobar

15:04.837 --> 15:06.065
to see the cockpit,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.139
but l stayed
in the aft section

15:08.240 --> 15:09.867
with Sister Dala, talking.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.772
About what?

15:11.844 --> 15:14.244
Well, me, mostly.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.282
She wanted to know
all about my role on Voyager.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.250
Ambassador,
Morale Officer, Head Chef.

15:20.319 --> 15:23.288
lt sounds as though
you're invaluable.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.289
l do what l can.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.791
Where is
your Voyager now?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.886
About three
light- years from here.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.726
Mmm. Your crew is alone
in this region?

15:33.799 --> 15:35.892
We are the only
Federation starship

15:36.001 --> 15:37.559
within 30,000 light- years.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.501
That must be difficult.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.937
Sometimes it is, but we manage.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.908
We've single- handedly
taken on the Borg,

15:44.977 --> 15:47.138
the Hirogen, Species 8472...

15:47.212 --> 15:49.942
Oh. l'm impressed.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.642
Captain Janeway deserves
most of the credit.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.447
She's an extraordinary woman.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.613
Your Captain is a woman?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.782
The finest one l've ever known.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.552
Tell me about her.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.220
Well, uh...
she's commanded Voyager

16:03.295 --> 16:05.058
for almost six years now.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.564
Before that, she was a science
officer on the Al- Batani.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.498
Where does she come from?

16:09.601 --> 16:10.761
Earth.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.530
lt's in the Alpha Quadrant.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.832
She grew up on

16:13.973 --> 16:16.305
a little farm
in a place called lndiana.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.637
You'd like her.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.235
l'm sure l would.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.280
Sister Dala.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.872
Yes, Brother Mobar.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.278
lt's late.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.615
We must return
to the sanctuary.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.449
So soon?

16:29.521 --> 16:32.547
lt's time for
the evening meditation.

16:32.624 --> 16:36.890
We can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.896
We're just glad
that we could help.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.294
The blessing.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.665
Certainly.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.801
May the Deities

16:51.877 --> 16:54.345
bless these travelers.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.938
Tala ot val,

16:57.016 --> 16:59.985
tala ot relina,

17:00.052 --> 17:01.349
sen tala,

17:01.420 --> 17:03.012

17:03.088 --> 17:04.714

17:04.790 --> 17:06.951

17:07.026 --> 17:08.459
tala otval,

17:08.527 --> 17:09.618
tala ot relina.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.127
Then we transported them

17:11.195 --> 17:12.560
back to their sanctuary.

17:12.631 --> 17:15.361
How long did this blessing last?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.867
No more than a minute or two.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.767
That's probably all they needed.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.807
For what?

17:26.845 --> 17:28.779
Just what l thought.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.111
The entire database
was downloaded

17:31.183 --> 17:33.276
18 days ago.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.480
Brother Mobar... the talisman.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.681
lt was obviously

17:37.756 --> 17:38.688
some sort of scanner.

17:38.757 --> 17:39.689
What would a couple

17:39.758 --> 17:40.747
of religious clerics

17:40.826 --> 17:42.020
want with our database?

17:42.094 --> 17:44.187
lt might help

17:44.263 --> 17:46.891
if they wanted to pose
as Federation officers.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.556
Gentlemen,

17:48.634 --> 17:51.535
l believe you've been had.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.582
The way l see it,
we're both victims.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.550
Your bolomite was stolen,

18:06.618 --> 18:09.519
and our reputation
has been damaged.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.419
What are you proposing?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.254
You said you had
scans of the vessel

18:14.326 --> 18:16.157
that visited your mining colony.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.820
lf you allow us to analyze them,

18:17.963 --> 18:19.294
we might be able to derive

18:19.364 --> 18:20.956
the impostors' warp signature.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.024
We could find them
and recover your property

18:23.102 --> 18:24.433
before they cheat
someone else.

18:24.536 --> 18:28.165
This is all difficult
for me to believe.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.868
Two of your crewmen
deceived by clerics?

18:32.010 --> 18:35.411
Humph! Could they really
have been so naive?

18:35.481 --> 18:37.039
A legitimate question.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.016
lt's obvious we're dealing

18:39.084 --> 18:40.108
with clever adversaries- -

18:40.185 --> 18:41.152
they fooled both of us.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.687
But l'm confident
we can stop them.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.780
Perhaps l should
contact Telsian Security.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.224
They have,
uh, persuasive methods

18:48.293 --> 18:50.227
for determining the truth.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.162
ln the meantime,
the real thieves

18:53.232 --> 18:55.723
could be halfway
across the sector,

18:55.801 --> 18:58.770
with your bolomite
in their cargo hold.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.717
And finally,
our Bridge.

19:20.792 --> 19:23.352
ls this a typical
Federation vessel?

19:23.428 --> 19:24.759
Well, the Delta Flyer

19:24.830 --> 19:25.762
may look a little worn,

19:25.831 --> 19:26.763
but that's only because

19:26.832 --> 19:27.958
she's been through so much.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.092
This ship
has helped fend off

19:30.202 --> 19:33.638
the Borg, the Hirogen,
Species 8472.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.970
Most of your technology
is outdated.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.670
Show him the mothership,
Mr. Chakotay.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.736
The USS Voyager...

19:41.813 --> 19:43.303
lntrepid- class.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.782
15 decks of the most
advanced technology

19:45.851 --> 19:47.113
you'll find anywhere.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.051
Dilithium- powered
warp engines,

19:49.121 --> 19:51.089
integrated
bio- neural circuitry,

19:51.156 --> 19:53.818
holodecks...

19:53.892 --> 19:56.759
ls this a typical
Federation vessel?

19:56.828 --> 19:59.888
Every ship in the fleet is built
to exacting standards.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.693
But l'd be lying if l told you

20:01.767 --> 20:03.894
l didn't think Voyager
was exceptional.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.095
As her Captain,
l'm not entirely objective.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.937
l'm sure you feel
the same way about your ship.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.943
lt is my home.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.570
l'm glad to hear you
say that, Mr. Varn...

20:16.648 --> 20:23.315
because that's exactly
what the Federation is- - a home

20:23.388 --> 20:27.119
for an extended family
who share resources

20:27.192 --> 20:31.424
and come to one another's aid
in time of need.

20:31.496 --> 20:34.056
So, if my ship joins
your Federation,

20:34.132 --> 20:36.965
Voyager will help
me fight my enemies?

20:37.135 --> 20:40.901
The primary goal of
the Federation is exploration.

20:40.973 --> 20:41.940
Military objectives are...

20:42.007 --> 20:43.304
There's no need

20:43.375 --> 20:46.344
to bore our guest
with Starfleet protocol, Tuvok.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.209
My enemies have
sophisticated weaponry.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.114
As do we.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.515
Photon torpedoes...

20:53.585 --> 20:58.022
optronically targeted phasers...

20:58.090 --> 21:00.024
multispectrum shielding.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.719
All of which

21:01.760 --> 21:03.625
we would not hesitate to share

21:03.695 --> 21:06.459
with a fellow member
of the Federation.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.692
What will l have to do to join?

21:08.767 --> 21:10.598
ln order to be considered,

21:10.702 --> 21:13.637
a candidate must make
formal application.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.538
An extensive review is conducted
by a committee composed of...

21:16.608 --> 21:18.439
The process is complicated,

21:18.510 --> 21:20.842
but Captain Janeway
has influence

21:20.912 --> 21:22.846
with the Federation Council.

21:22.914 --> 21:26.213
And you would use that
influence on my behalf?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.220
Well, l'd be foolish not to.

21:29.288 --> 21:36.387
You are just the type
of candidate we're looking for.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.089
Uh, l'll have to discuss
this with my shipmates.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.292
Well, joining the Federation
is a serious commitment.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.959
Take all the time you need.

21:44.102 --> 21:47.094
Captain, our latest orders
from Starfleet Command.

21:47.205 --> 21:50.003
We won't be back here
for at least six months.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.702
Well, perhaps we can discuss
your application then.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.872
l- lf we were to apply now,

21:55.947 --> 21:58.279
could you assure us
we'd be accepted?

22:02.154 --> 22:06.056
You realize you'll have to
commit considerable resources?

22:06.124 --> 22:08.649
l'll do whatever is necessary.

22:10.462 --> 22:14.364
Well, let me be
the first to say...

22:14.433 --> 22:15.365
welcome

22:15.434 --> 22:17.629
to the Federation.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.640
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

22:30.716 --> 22:31.648
l've been flying

22:31.717 --> 22:33.082
concentric
search patterns

22:33.151 --> 22:35.483
for the last 12 hours.

22:35.554 --> 22:39.388
Any sign
of the impostors?

22:39.458 --> 22:42.723
Neelix, what has happened to us?

22:42.794 --> 22:45.160
l know exactly what you mean.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.891
l've been over it
a thousand times.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.626
Why didn't we see this coming?

22:48.700 --> 22:49.632
Orphans.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.703
lt's the oldest gambit
in the book.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.499
l- l mean, if it'd been Harry,
l could understand it.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.574
He trusts everybody,
but you and me?

22:56.641 --> 22:59.337
We've dealt with our share
of shady characters.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.540
l think maybe...

23:01.613 --> 23:03.740
maybe we've lost our edge.

23:07.419 --> 23:10.411
Hand me one of those
terra nuts.

23:10.489 --> 23:11.751
What are you doing?

23:11.823 --> 23:13.051
Proving you wrong.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.992
Ah, the old shell game.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.224
All we need
now is a mark.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.822
l think l see one coming.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.367
Uh, you go ahead.

23:23.468 --> 23:25.936
l'll follow your lead.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.538
Now, watch carefully.

23:27.639 --> 23:30.301
l place the terra nut
under the cup.

23:30.375 --> 23:31.808
Then l shuffle them.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.936
'Round and 'round they go.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.240
Keep your eye
on the nut.

23:36.314 --> 23:40.648
But be careful- - the hand
is faster than the eye.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.153
Now, for three hours
of holodeck time,

23:43.221 --> 23:45.815
can you tell me
where is the terra nut?

23:45.891 --> 23:46.858
Uh...

23:48.360 --> 23:49.588
there.

23:49.661 --> 23:52.755
No, no... no,
that one.

23:52.831 --> 23:56.323
Oh... l really thought
l had you this time.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.426
Oh, keep trying, Neelix.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.004
You'll fool me
one of these days.

24:00.038 --> 24:01.096
This looks like
an interesting game.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.105
May l have a turn?

24:02.174 --> 24:03.106
Oh, be my guest.

24:03.175 --> 24:06.770
But, um, you'll have
to wager something.

24:06.845 --> 24:09.678
lf l win, you take
three duty shifts in Sick Bay.

24:09.748 --> 24:14.310
And if l win, you take
three shifts in the Kitchen.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.978
Done.

24:16.054 --> 24:18.022
Ready?

24:18.089 --> 24:22.116
Now, watch carefully.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.627
'Round and 'round they go.

24:23.695 --> 24:25.663
Follow the terra nut if you can.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.595
But be careful- - 
the hand is faster

24:27.666 --> 24:28.598
than the eye.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.726
Careful, Doc,
try not to blink.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.269
Don't you worry, Mr. Paris.

24:32.337 --> 24:34.805
You have to get up
pretty early in the morning

24:34.906 --> 24:36.533
to fool
my optical subroutines.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.972
Where is it, then?

24:46.051 --> 24:47.882
ln your left palm.

24:54.726 --> 24:55.658
How did you...?

24:55.727 --> 24:57.194
Superior visual acuity.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.559
See you in Sick Bay.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.137
l'm detecting a vessel
on long- range scans.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.038
The warp signature matches
the impostor's ship.

25:10.108 --> 25:12.338
Harry, tell Tom
his coffee break is over.

25:12.410 --> 25:14.002
Set a pursuit course.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.046
Yes, ma'am.

25:18.116 --> 25:20.710
The photon torpedoes you gave me
are worthless.

25:20.785 --> 25:21.752
No better than plasma flares.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.185
No better than plasma flares.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.813
Perhaps you
didn't arm them properly.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.289
And in the middle of the battle,

25:26.358 --> 25:29.418
the Polonians warned me
to cease hostilities

25:29.494 --> 25:33.191
or face destruction
at the hands of your Federation!

25:33.265 --> 25:35.324
You allowed my enemies
to join!

25:35.400 --> 25:37.698
Evidently, the Federation
Council decided that...

25:37.802 --> 25:40.032
Your Federation is a fraud!

25:40.138 --> 25:42.436
l demand reparations.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.668
You will have to submit
a formal report to Starfleet.

25:44.743 --> 25:45.937
Enough!

25:46.044 --> 25:50.242
lf you will not reimburse me,
l'll seize your ship.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.479
Disable the beam!

25:58.089 --> 25:59.181
l can't.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.725
We have an additional problem- -

26:01.826 --> 26:02.793
Voyager.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.930
There's another ship
alongside the impostors.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.727
lt's got them in a tractor beam.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.062
Hail both vessels.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.596
No response from either one.

26:14.706 --> 26:15.968
Well, let's try to
get their attention.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.008
Mr. Tuvok...

26:18.109 --> 26:20.009
Voyager's charging weapons.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.773
Perhaps we should
surrender to them.

26:21.846 --> 26:24.041
The Federation has an
extremely humane policy

26:24.115 --> 26:25.480
regarding the treatment

26:25.550 --> 26:27.541
of prisoners...

26:27.619 --> 26:30.452
Hail Varn again!

26:30.522 --> 26:32.581
Do it!

26:32.657 --> 26:34.522
Look on your scanners, Varn.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.652
Our mothership's arrived.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.389
She's armed
and ready to defend us.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.159
Tell them to stand down.

26:43.234 --> 26:47.603
Release us,
or Voyager will destroy you.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.435
The other ship is hailing.

26:49.507 --> 26:51.498
On screen.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.940
Stand down, Voyager.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.547
l have no argument with you.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.742
However, the vessel
you're tractoring...

26:58.817 --> 27:00.284
l paid
for my Federation membership.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.286
The Delta Flyer
belongs to me now.

27:03.321 --> 27:06.154
Sir, l think
you've been misled.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.954
Yes, l have.

27:15.734 --> 27:17.065
Three direct hits.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.635
Shields down to 60 percent.

27:18.737 --> 27:19.931
Target his tractor beam.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.266
Nobody is taking possession

27:21.373 --> 27:23.204
of the ''Delta Flyer''
today, except us.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.204
Lock on to them.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.406
Yes, ma'am.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.740
Now our tractor generator's
off- line.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.652
Shields down to 41 percent.

27:37.722 --> 27:41.249
The impostor's ship
is powering engines.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.315
Seven, transport everyone

27:42.394 --> 27:43.861
on that vessel
directly to the brig.

27:43.928 --> 27:47.420
Establishing a lock
on three life signs.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.490
That impact damaged
the transporters.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.228
l'm losing annular confinement.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.735
Harry, reroute
additional power!

27:57.709 --> 27:58.641
They're gone.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.642
Seven?

27:59.711 --> 28:01.474
l only got one of them.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.013
Get us out of here,
Mr. Paris.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.380
Aye, Captain.

28:26.938 --> 28:28.929
Nice hair.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.907
lt's not really my taste.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.807
Posing as a Starfleet Captain,

28:36.881 --> 28:39.213
selling memberships
to the Federation...

28:39.284 --> 28:40.216
Too bad we didn't

28:40.285 --> 28:41.217
think of it, Tuvok.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.344
lmagine the resources

28:42.420 --> 28:44.752
we could have acquired
over the past six years.

28:44.823 --> 28:45.790
lndeed.

28:45.857 --> 28:46.824
l have to admit

28:46.891 --> 28:48.552
l'm impressed.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.821
l wish l could say the same.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.886
The great Captain Janeway.

28:52.997 --> 28:54.828
Somehow, l expected you

28:54.899 --> 28:56.366
to be...

28:56.468 --> 28:58.595
taller.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.068
l make a better you than you.

29:00.171 --> 29:02.002
Oh, l don't know.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.907
l'd say we're
very much alike- -

29:04.976 --> 29:08.639
resourceful, intelligent,
ambitious- -

29:08.713 --> 29:12.205
but with just one
tiny difference.

29:12.283 --> 29:13.944
And what is that?

29:14.018 --> 29:16.043
l'm not a liar and a thief.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.055
You're going to give me

29:18.123 --> 29:20.284
a detailed account
of everyone you cheated

29:20.358 --> 29:22.724
and exactly what you did
with their property.

29:22.794 --> 29:25.456
Why would l do that?

29:25.530 --> 29:26.622
Because if you don't,

29:26.698 --> 29:29.030
l'm turning you over
to Telsian Security.

29:29.134 --> 29:32.194
Oh, is that supposed
to frighten me?

29:32.303 --> 29:34.396
How much do you know
about the Telsians?

29:34.506 --> 29:38.169
Just that they're a more
gullible species than most.

29:39.244 --> 29:42.611
Tell her about your
research, Mr. Tuvok.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.873
l- l beg your pardon, Captain?

29:46.017 --> 29:47.109
On Telsian law.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.846
l think it's only fair

29:48.920 --> 29:52.083
that we let our guest
know what to expect.

29:52.157 --> 29:57.561
The Telsian criminal justice
system is rather barbaric.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.224
Tell her about the prisons.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.891
Barely habitable.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.900
lnmates often die
of malnutrition

30:06.004 --> 30:08.165
before they are
brought to trial.

30:08.273 --> 30:10.707
Torture is commonplace,
as is disease,

30:10.775 --> 30:13.938
including several incurable
forms of psoriasis.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.276
l think she gets
the general idea.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.145
Suppose l do tell you.

30:19.217 --> 30:23.950
How do l know you won't turn me
over to the Telsians anyway?

30:24.055 --> 30:27.957
lf you make full restitution
to your victims,

30:28.059 --> 30:30.926
l'll give you safe passage
out of this area.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.192
ls that a promise, Captain?

30:34.265 --> 30:36.893
l know it's hard
for you to believe,

30:37.001 --> 30:40.368
but occasionally,
some of us tell the truth.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.866
Give me the Delta Flyer

30:43.975 --> 30:46.739
and three days to get
as far away from here as l can,

30:46.811 --> 30:50.303
and then l'll send you
the information you want.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.611
How naive do you think l am?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.551
As far as the victims
are concerned,

30:55.620 --> 30:58.316
you're the one who cheated them.

30:58.389 --> 30:59.583
Without my help,

30:59.657 --> 31:02.490
you'll be the one
who has a problem

31:02.594 --> 31:04.221
leaving this sector.

31:05.296 --> 31:10.700
Tuvok, contact
Telsian Security.

31:17.075 --> 31:20.044
Tell them we have
a prisoner to turn over.

31:28.519 --> 31:29.747
''Psoriasis''?

31:29.821 --> 31:32.381
lmprovisation is not
foremost among my talents.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.288
Considering l caught you
off guard,

31:34.359 --> 31:36.623
l thought your performance
was exemplary.

31:36.694 --> 31:37.683
Thank you, Captain.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.627
Was your order
to call the Telsians

31:39.697 --> 31:40.823
part of the deception,

31:40.899 --> 31:43.299
or did you actually
want me to contact them?

31:43.401 --> 31:44.698
Not yet.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.702
Let's give Dala some time
to think about

31:46.771 --> 31:47.863
those barbaric prisons.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.269
Do you believe she'll relent?

31:49.340 --> 31:50.307
l'm not sure.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.432
Something tells me

31:51.542 --> 31:52.975
she's just as stubborn as l am.

31:53.044 --> 31:53.976
Then, am l to assume

31:54.045 --> 31:55.410
you have an alternative plan?

31:55.480 --> 31:58.142
l'm like you, Tuvok- - 
making it up as l go along.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.261
The Captain said
bread and water,

32:15.333 --> 32:17.801
but l didn't see any harm.

32:17.902 --> 32:19.301
l'm not hungry.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.442
l'll just leave it here...

32:27.512 --> 32:30.743
in case you change your mind.

32:35.019 --> 32:36.884
May l ask you something?

32:38.089 --> 32:41.058
You want to know if you really
resemble the Redeemer of Light?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.956
l'm not that gullible.

32:43.094 --> 32:44.652
Then what?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.195
Do you ever feel guilty?

32:50.735 --> 32:51.963
Taking advantage of people

32:52.136 --> 32:54.366
who actually think
that you care about them?

32:56.407 --> 32:58.398
You seem like a good person.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.170
l'm sorry l lied to you.

33:00.278 --> 33:04.442
Actually, l think you're
just sorry you got caught.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.012
Probably.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.280
There.

33:09.354 --> 33:10.685
Now you're being honest.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.848
l knew it was possible.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.323
lf you don't mind my asking,

33:17.395 --> 33:20.091
why do you do what you do?

33:20.164 --> 33:24.828
My father taught me most people
will exploit you if they can.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.632
So, it's best
to exploit them first.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.937
You know, l used
to be a lot like you.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.944
Living by my wits,

33:35.013 --> 33:37.379
never trusting anyone,

33:37.448 --> 33:39.916
always, uh, trying to end up

33:39.984 --> 33:42.919
on the more profitable side
of a transaction.

33:42.987 --> 33:46.218
But now you don't hesitate
to help starving orphans.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.655
l changed...

33:47.725 --> 33:51.559
when Captain Janeway
made me part of her crew.

33:51.629 --> 33:54.962
l suppose you
suddenly reformed.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.966
No, no, not right away.

33:57.101 --> 34:00.832
At first, l was just
exploiting an opportunity

34:00.905 --> 34:04.773
to get a warm bed,
food, protection.

34:04.842 --> 34:07.367
l kept waiting to find out
what the Captain

34:07.445 --> 34:08.775
wanted in return.

34:08.846 --> 34:11.371
But she never asked for a thing.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.746
On the contrary.

34:12.817 --> 34:15.581
She expected
a great deal from me.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.213
Honesty, loyalty, hard work.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.085
l should've guessed.

34:20.158 --> 34:24.150
But l discovered that
those were commodities

34:24.228 --> 34:26.889
l had in abundance,

34:26.998 --> 34:29.989
and i- it was much more
profitable to share them

34:30.101 --> 34:32.864
than it was to be self- serving
and cynical

34:32.969 --> 34:34.027
all the time.

34:34.138 --> 34:36.936
l- l- l'm happier than
l've ever been.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.478
l suppose that you think
l could change, too.

34:42.547 --> 34:45.380
Stranger things have happened.

34:46.984 --> 34:49.179
Do you really think
that she'll give me

34:49.253 --> 34:51.244
safe passage if l
make restitution?

34:51.322 --> 34:53.949
lf that's what she promised you.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.081
Then what?

34:55.159 --> 34:58.492
l have never done anything else.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.832
Captain Janeway let
Seven of Nine

35:02.934 --> 35:04.333
remain on board,

35:04.402 --> 35:05.699
and she was Borg.

35:05.803 --> 35:08.772
Are you saying she'd do
the same thing for me?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.400
l'd be willing to talk to her.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.977
l cheated you.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.638
Why are you being so kind to me?

35:16.714 --> 35:20.582
Like my great- grandmother
used to say- -

35:20.651 --> 35:23.051
''lt's nice to be nice.''

35:27.458 --> 35:29.050
ls that tea still warm?

35:39.704 --> 35:41.797
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm so clumsy.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.270
Security to the brig!

36:21.312 --> 36:23.143
She's gone.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.881
lt's not right to abandon her.

36:34.959 --> 36:37.325
Going back is too dangerous.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.362
She's our Captain.

36:38.429 --> 36:39.657
No, she's not.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.890
And even if she were,

36:40.998 --> 36:42.329
we wouldn't be able
to rescue her.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.332
We'd be captured
ourselves.

36:43.434 --> 36:44.560
Without Captain Janeway,

36:44.669 --> 36:47.160
it will be difficult
to continue our activities.

36:47.271 --> 36:48.863
lt's too late for that.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.941
There must be
a logical way...

36:51.008 --> 36:54.444
What's logical is to get
as far away as we can.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.381
There's a vessel
approaching.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.213
lt's the Delta Flyer.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.980
Activate the shields.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.317
They're hailing.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.085
lt's Captain Janeway.

37:08.159 --> 37:11.026
Our Janeway or theirs?

37:11.095 --> 37:12.494
Which one did you expect?

37:12.563 --> 37:15.259
l'm pleased to see you, Captain.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.960
Lower the shields,
so l can transport aboard.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.504
How were you able to escape?

37:20.571 --> 37:22.198
l'll tell you once l'm aboard.

37:22.306 --> 37:24.399
lt's difficult to believe
you weren't detected.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.772
Are you accusing me
of something?

37:34.785 --> 37:36.047
..being cautious.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.988
How do we know
this isn't a deception?

37:40.057 --> 37:41.888
Why would l try to deceive you?

37:41.993 --> 37:44.518
You could be helping Voyager
capture us in exchange...

37:44.595 --> 37:46.062
Are we in position?

37:46.130 --> 37:47.290
We don't have time for this.

37:47.365 --> 37:48.297
- Lower your shields...
- Ready?

37:48.366 --> 37:50.334
and beam me aboard.

37:56.674 --> 37:59.040
Captain on the Bridge.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.169
A- As you were.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.644
Now...

38:04.715 --> 38:06.615
what about the bolomite
and the rest of our earnings?

38:06.684 --> 38:09.050
They're exactly
where we left them.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.748
Well, it's time to collect
them and leave the region.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.687
Set a course before
Voyager finds us.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.817
You're not in command here.

38:15.926 --> 38:19.089
l just spent the last
24 hours in Voyager's brig.

38:19.163 --> 38:21.324
l have no intention
of going back.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.560
l'm picking up life signs

38:23.668 --> 38:24.828
on the Delta Flyer.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.264
That can't be.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.529
l was right.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.801
You brought them here.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.400
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.741
Whoever it is
must've stowed away.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.440
They're hailing.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.608
On screen.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.845
This is Tom Paris
of the Starship Voyager.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.079
Prepare to be boarded.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.652
He's charging weapons.

38:45.723 --> 38:46.917
Evasive maneuvers.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.734
Let's get everything
on board

39:00.838 --> 39:01.805
as quickly as we can.

39:01.872 --> 39:03.703
How many transport enhancers

39:03.774 --> 39:05.469
do you recommend, Captain?

39:05.543 --> 39:07.408
Do l have to think
of everything?

39:07.478 --> 39:08.706
We'll need at least ten

39:08.779 --> 39:11.043
if we're going to beam
all that bolomite

39:11.115 --> 39:12.309
through the geostrata.

39:12.383 --> 39:14.283
Maybe we should take 12.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.546
''We''?

39:15.619 --> 39:17.814
ls there a problem?

39:17.888 --> 39:20.083
ln six years,
l've never known you

39:20.157 --> 39:22.819
to dirty your hands
with menial labor.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.829
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

39:26.931 --> 39:28.091
You don't trust us.

39:28.165 --> 39:30.429
Who knows what
the two of you planned

39:30.534 --> 39:32.331
while l was in Voyager's brig.

39:32.436 --> 39:33.869
As Chief of Security,
l would never...

39:33.938 --> 39:35.963
lt's all right.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.904
We'll all go together.

39:39.343 --> 39:41.334
After you.

39:52.056 --> 39:55.423
The next populated sector
is 13 days from here.

39:55.493 --> 39:59.361
When we arrive, we'll trade
the Delta Flyer for a new ship.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.261
Voyager will never find us.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.994
Are all the transport
enhancers in place?

40:04.101 --> 40:06.069
That's the last of them.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.468
We can go now...

40:07.538 --> 40:10.530
if that's acceptable
to you, Captain.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.938
l'm afraid there's been

40:12.009 --> 40:13.306
a change of plans.

40:14.979 --> 40:16.776
l've found the stolen items,
Captain.

40:16.847 --> 40:18.542
You can lock on
to my coordinates.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.709
l told you
she couldn't be trusted.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.050
How could you bring yourself
to deceive your fellow officers?

40:24.121 --> 40:26.589
Voyager, l repeat,
l am in position.

40:26.657 --> 40:27.715
Can you get a lock?

40:27.792 --> 40:28.816
Voyager, trans...

40:28.893 --> 40:30.417
Negative.
The geostratum is too dense.

40:30.494 --> 40:31.586
Keep trying.

40:31.662 --> 40:33.254
Please respond immediately.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.319
l'm outnumbered.

40:34.398 --> 40:35.422
Tuvok.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.796
Captain, l need assistance.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.596
Voyager, now would be
an excellent time

40:38.702 --> 40:39.669
to initiate transport.

40:39.737 --> 40:42.035
You're not transporting
anything.

40:46.644 --> 40:48.373
Captain?

40:56.387 --> 40:58.218
Voyager, please respond.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.654
You're a sight for sore eyes.

41:07.665 --> 41:11.066
Commander... Tuvok.

41:11.168 --> 41:12.726
The one and only.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.798
Logic would indicate

41:17.908 --> 41:20.877
that neither of us
has the advantage.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.572
Your logic is flawed.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.320
Stay where you are.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.524
What did they promise you
for betraying us?

41:36.594 --> 41:41.088
l believe you've mistaken me
for someone else.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.291
Where's Dala?

41:45.402 --> 41:48.428
l'm afraid she's indisposed
at the moment.

41:51.442 --> 41:54.605
l wouldn't get up too fast
if l were you, Captain.

41:54.678 --> 41:57.010
lt's going to take
another few minutes

41:57.147 --> 41:59.115
for the ambizine to wear off.

42:01.886 --> 42:05.413
Captain's Log, Stardate 53849.2.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.981
The stolen property has been
returned to the Telsian miners,

42:09.059 --> 42:12.119
as well as vessels
from seven different worlds.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.097
l'm hoping that the reputation
of the real Federation

42:15.165 --> 42:18.657
will survive the events
of the last several days.

42:18.769 --> 42:21.169
'Round and 'round they go.

42:21.238 --> 42:22.899
Follow the terra nut if you can.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.563
But remember, the hand

42:24.675 --> 42:27.109
is sharper than
your visual acuity.

42:27.177 --> 42:30.112
l thought we'd already
disproved that theory.

42:30.180 --> 42:32.011
You tell me.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.175
The terra nut
is firmly entrenched

42:36.253 --> 42:37.550
up your right sleeve.

42:40.491 --> 42:41.753
Sorry.

42:47.264 --> 42:48.322
That's impossible.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.196
The old handoff.

42:53.203 --> 42:54.170
Ooh.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.034
That's cheating.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.542
We've still got it.
