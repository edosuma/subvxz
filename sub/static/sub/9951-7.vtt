WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:06.079
- Previously on Haven...

00:06.215 --> 00:07.421
You took my clothes.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.164
- And I saved your life.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.757
- You must be Duke.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.719
- Does she know
you're not a real boy?

00:13.847 --> 00:16.054
- Consensus says it was
a wolf attack, probably rabid.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.265
- Something about this
just feels creepy.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.224
- I wanted you in this job
because you got a knack

00:20.354 --> 00:21.560
with dealing
with all this crap.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.179
I'm just praying to God
some of it rubs off on him.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.602
- You really think
this Jess Minion is a witch?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.396
- What do you think
the troubles are?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.360
Magic is everywhere here.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.231
- Whatever she is,
she is interesting.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.232
- I'm gonna do what I can

00:35.369 --> 00:37.826
to help you find out
about your mum.

00:37.955 --> 00:38.944
- You would do that?

00:39.081 --> 00:41.197
- Well, we gotta stick
together up here.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.369
- The troubles are back,
aren't they?

00:43.502 --> 00:45.914
- Yeah, I think so.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.751
[thunder rumbles]

00:57.224 --> 00:59.590
- All right, boys,
let's wipe her down.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.886
Clean her up.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.759
- Yes, captain.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.566
- This is nice, right?
- Yep.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.398
Which makes us wonder
why you dragged us

01:08.527 --> 01:09.642
all the way out here.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.813
- Hmm.

01:10.946 --> 01:14.438
Galley wench,
we're empty!

01:14.575 --> 01:17.362
Wench! Beer!

01:18.870 --> 01:20.701
Ready, boys?

01:20.831 --> 01:24.949
I got a line on a sexy
little private equity fund.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.746
- Come on. Here we go.
- Like last time?

01:26.878 --> 01:29.085
My wallet is still bleeding.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.954
I'll pass, thanks.
Let's go.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.423
- Fellas, wait.
Where are you going?

01:33.552 --> 01:35.417
This deal
has huge margins

01:35.554 --> 01:37.169
and a killer matrix.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.137
I can get you in
under the wire

01:39.266 --> 01:41.473
if you get me the funds
right now.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.638
- No, thanks, Wally.
Fool us once...

01:43.770 --> 01:45.306
- Boys.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.804
Come on.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.022
We're talking
ground floor here.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.016
Guys.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.444
Perfect.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.484
Damn it.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.527
- I have your beers.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.445
We ran out of imports,
so I had to—

01:59.578 --> 02:01.318
- [gasping]

02:01.455 --> 02:03.070
[groans]

02:09.087 --> 02:10.338
- Oh, no!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.500
- [groans]

02:12.633 --> 02:16.125
- [screams]

02:16.261 --> 02:17.762
Help!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.879
- [screams]

02:29.816 --> 02:32.148
- So you saw the prowler?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.017
- A glimpse.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.691
Barely.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.359
He was 6'7".

02:38.492 --> 02:40.528
One eyebrow.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.242
Fu Manchu.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.204
Carried a small slingshot.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.197
Had a tattoo.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.540
- Of what?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.910
- Does it matter?

02:51.046 --> 02:54.504
He was a 6'7" unibrow
sling-shotty monster.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.875
- Maybe you want
to swing by?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.423
Look for footprints?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.546
-Um...

03:02.683 --> 03:03.547
yeah.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.094
Yeah, I guess I should.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.013
- Jess, I think Detective
Wuornos needs to come by

03:07.145 --> 03:08.555
and conduct a safety review
of your home.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.350
I'd say around 8:00?

03:10.482 --> 03:11.597
- Great.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.270
I shot a deer,
so we're having venison.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.064
Maybe you can bring
a nice bottle?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.561
- Of wine.

03:17.698 --> 03:22.442
- No, antacid.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.363
I thought you were
all about protecting animals

03:24.496 --> 03:25.906
and moving them
to safe habitats.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.074
-lam.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.913
I usually use
a tranquilizer gun,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.907
but it makes them
taste funny.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.252
- [chuckles]

03:34.381 --> 03:36.872
[phone rings]

03:37.008 --> 03:39.090
- Maybe someone
should get that?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.551
[ringing continues]

03:44.891 --> 03:46.973
- Hello.
Nathan Police Department.

03:47.102 --> 03:51.186
I mean Haven PD.
Wuornos speaking.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.107
- That was painful to watch.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.817
- No one was forcing you to.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.277
- Uh, "Of wine?"

03:59.406 --> 04:01.613
Yeah, we should show that
to suspects who won't talk.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.858
- Okay.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.155
- I mean, it'd probably
be cruel and unusual punishment.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.994
- Well, if my personal life
is so painful to you,

04:08.123 --> 04:09.454
maybe you should
just stay out of it.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.538
- Hey, I'd love to.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.407
- But you can't.
You're incapable.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.205
- Oh, numb on the outside,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.328
sensitive on the inside.

04:16.465 --> 04:19.172
- Just a sec here, boys.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.292
- So what happened to him?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.292
- Anybody squeamish?

04:22.429 --> 04:23.635
- Not me,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.846
but Nathan's
a little sensitive.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.134
- Yeah, all right.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.973
Ruler-straight.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.093
Clean breaks
through both femurs

04:31.229 --> 04:32.480
on a horizontal axis.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.971
Massive tissue
and bone damage.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.643
- Those are tough bones
to have broken.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.186
- Well, tough for
something to break.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.525
They're as thick
as spinnakers,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.814
and here, look at this.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.279
Identical fracture
in the arm.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.491
It looks to be
at a 90—degree angle

04:46.620 --> 04:47.826
to the leg fracture.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.945
- Did he lose blood?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.367
'Cause his coloring...

04:52.501 --> 04:53.490
What's this?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.538
- Well, look at that.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.503
Oh, I'll have to take that
to the lab.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.214
- So he was assaulted.
By who?

05:01.343 --> 05:03.334
- By what?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.006
- Good question.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.507
Well, you know
where to find me,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.850
should the occasion arise.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.355
- All right, so you want
to go talk to Wall Street,

05:14.481 --> 05:16.267
and I'll talk
to the captain?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.682
- Excuse me.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.236
- So you called it in?

05:23.365 --> 05:26.528
- It's my boat.
I'm responsible.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.651
- You remember any weird waves?
Loose winch line?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.948
Mizzenmast?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.868
I'm from Ohio.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.989
- We were at the dock.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.832
I shut down all systems
that have any real power

05:36.962 --> 05:37.872
the minute I tie off.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.505
And this boat
is cutting edge

05:39.631 --> 05:42.623
in terms of safety,
technology.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.377
- Yeah, this is a pretty nice
operation you have here.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.878
- Yeah, a little off
the beaten path,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.130
so the extra touches
help me compete.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.724
- All right, what can you
tell me about the victim?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.889
- Wallace is loaded.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.138
High-end tastes.
My bread and butter really.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.355
- Were they having
a good time?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.770
- Blue water, big fish,
cold beer.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.143
Who's not having
a good time?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.440
- Me.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.063
Just dragging a hook,
hoping to land the big one,

06:06.199 --> 06:07.188
that is not my thing.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.735
- You'd never make it
on Wall Street.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.075
- [chuckles]

06:10.203 --> 06:12.114
Thank you.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.578
- They claim
they didn't see anything.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.575
- Do you believe 'em?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.043
- Kept my hand on my wallet

06:20.171 --> 06:21.377
the whole time.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.540
They say they left him
with the crew.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.923
- Took me a while
to get their beers.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.090
If I'd come up sooner...

06:30.223 --> 06:31.724
- That had nothing to do
with it, sweetie.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.056
Nothing at all.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.391
- So you're her father?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.726
And Jimmy?

06:36.855 --> 06:39.972
- I'm her fiancé.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.771
- So this is a family crew.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.939
That's great.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.481
- Personally,
I wish she wasn't

06:46.615 --> 06:47.650
working on the boat.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.443
- Teacher's salary's small,
Dad.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.565
We need the money.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.693
- But against
my better judgment,

06:52.829 --> 06:55.366
Vickie suddenly started
picking shifts.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.113
More time with Jimmy,
I guess.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.330
- And you.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.997
- All right,
so you brought the beers.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.461
- And I stepped
onto the deck,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.797
and there was
this crunching sound,

07:05.926 --> 07:09.635
and then he was—
he was down.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.549
- And you two
didn't see anything?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.057
- No, no, we were on the bow

07:13.183 --> 07:15.139
cleaning up
from the day's fishing.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.600
- Yeah, hosing off
the spilled wine and pate.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.593
- Jimmy.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.516
- And you didn't
catch anything?

07:20.649 --> 07:22.139
- The only thing those guys
want to catch is a buzz.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.483
- Jimmy, go muck out
the chain lockers.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.897
Please.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.449
Look, fact of the matter is,

07:33.578 --> 07:36.320
these guys
get annoying as hell.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.538
And it bothers Jimmy
how hard we work for them.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.953
I mean, hell,
it bothers me.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.327
But...

07:43.463 --> 07:47.547
that's the way it is
for deckhands.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.088
You'd think having
an old man who was one

07:50.220 --> 07:52.552
would have
steered her away.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.017
- Maybe the guy was pinched
between the boat and the dock

07:59.145 --> 08:00.009
and no one saw.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.010
- One minute.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.398
- Lots of power
in a drifting boat.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.185
- 55 seconds,
that's all we've got.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.932
- For what?
- To rule out what's normal.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.855
All right,
so let's keep going.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.946
Sudden acute
early onset osteoporosis?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.189
Not likely.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.032
Sudden bone-crushing
weight gain?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.538
I mean, I guess
the pate could do that.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.450
- How about
boats are dangerous?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.538
- He was at a dock
on a powered-down boat

08:21.668 --> 08:24.580
that's nicer
than my apartment.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.375
And Vickie saw him crunch
in a pretty weird way.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.044
- You're that convinced
already that this—

08:30.176 --> 08:32.383
- Yes, because nothing
I've seen lines up

08:32.512 --> 08:36.801
except for two ruler-straight
breaks on Wallace's legs.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.345
And I'm pretty sure
Eleanor winked at me.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.217
- What?
- She's a doctor.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.731
She knows when things
aren't normal.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.348
And I'm getting the feeling
that she knows a lot more.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.475
- She winked at you?
- There was winkage.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.444
- Maybe you're right.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.064
ljust—sometimes I wish
we could get a normal—

08:54.200 --> 08:55.576
- Brutal assault.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.737
- Doesn't that sound
kind of nice?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.861
- Why would that be
any better?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.783
- At least it wouldn't
remind me of my own problems.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.246
- How does any of this
remind you

09:02.375 --> 09:03.990
that you have no game
with chicks?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.913
- Thanks.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.584
Okay, let's say
it's not something normal.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.877
What do we do?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.420
- We go to lunch.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.714
But you're not
gonna like it.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.884
[dramatic music]

09:22.020 --> 09:30.018
J‘J‘

09:57.430 --> 09:59.045
- Duke?

09:59.182 --> 10:00.262
- No, hey.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.597
No, oh.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.342
Oh, Haven's finest.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.437
You know, I could add
"ass" to that,

10:07.565 --> 10:08.850
"Haven's finest ass,"

10:08.983 --> 10:12.146
and it would still work
for both of you.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.064
Just in different ways.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.937
Uh, you guys—

10:16.074 --> 10:17.905
you guys want something
to drink?

10:18.034 --> 10:20.650
Beer? Wine? Clamato?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.870
- Or you could tell us
what's behind the tarp.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.704
- Well, that—that's—

10:25.834 --> 10:27.995
that is the central mystery
of life on the water,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.289
isn't it, Detective Parker?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.457
What is behind the tarp?

10:32.590 --> 10:33.966
What is behind
the tarp?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.457
So many have asked.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.256
So few ever find out.

10:40.682 --> 10:41.762
- Fine.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.348
We had a guy standing
on the back of a boat

10:44.477 --> 10:46.513
who suffered from some
ruler-straight injuries.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.012
- Broke both his legs
right across here.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.264
- Boom?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.516
- I don't know
what sound it made.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.358
- Now I know why you think
he's a boat expert.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.193
- Come on, I was kidding.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.732
- It was funny.
- Joke.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.941
- Not a sailboat.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.366
Sport fisher.
Deep V hull.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.989
- Somebody else's boom.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.037
Aye, the ocean,
she be a mysterious

11:10.170 --> 11:12.035
and dangerous place.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.209
- Like a tarp.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.672
- Sure.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.416
- Come on, just tell us
what's behind it.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.884
- Something I'm trying
to protect.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.503
- Because you're
a model citizen?

11:21.639 --> 11:22.799
- I have a code.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.015
Just one that says
I don't have to show you.

11:26.144 --> 11:30.103
In fact, not showing you
will probably be the most fun

11:30.231 --> 11:32.392
that I have today.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.530
Alas, I hate to see
a beautiful woman suffer.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.744
[sighs]

11:48.917 --> 11:51.124
Pam Seligson,
she's the town librarian.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.537
It's her 80th birthday.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.412
Asked me to hide the setup.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.254
I smuggled it,

11:57.383 --> 11:58.839
all of it,

11:58.968 --> 12:00.003
from Iceland.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.048
- That is really sweet, Duke.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.297
- So glad we came.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.550
- Nathan, you there, sugar?

12:08.686 --> 12:09.937
- Copy, Laverne.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.974
- You better get up to
Tradewinds Real Estate, doll.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.892
Sounds like somebody
got pretty PO'd

12:14.025 --> 12:16.562
at their broker.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.738
- Bye, Audrey.
You too, sugar.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.858
[police sirens, radio chatter]

12:26.788 --> 12:28.369
- Ten years on the job,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.659
I've never seen
anything like it.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.172
- Who is that?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.383
- Joe Santomauro.
Real estate agent.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.843
- And what happened to him?

12:48.142 --> 12:50.804
- He's been...sliced

12:50.937 --> 12:52.222
all the way through

12:52.355 --> 12:55.267
like a big loaf of bread.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.949
- Look familiar?

13:11.082 --> 13:12.663
- What's this have to do

13:12.792 --> 13:14.453
with our fractured friend
Wallace?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.496
- Did anybody
see what happened?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.211
- Yeah, him.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.272
- So Joe was a successful
real estate broker?

13:37.400 --> 13:40.688
- I don't want to gossip.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.067
Joe was a little
ethically challenged.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.531
Double-dipped on commissions
and whatnot.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.867
When the market contracted,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.702
the whisper was
he started working

13:51.831 --> 13:54.413
with a less-desirable element.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.373
Not Tradewinds Real Estate
kind of people.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.118
Here's my card
if you need me.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.496
- Will do.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.708
All right, so this Joe
seems like a swell guy.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.709
- Hmm.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.881
Think he learned his ethics

14:08.014 --> 14:10.050
in the same Boy Scout troop
as Mr. Wallace?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.014
He's been indicted
four times.

14:12.143 --> 14:15.306
Fraud times two,
tax evasion times two.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.473
- Okay, so let's just say

14:16.606 --> 14:18.142
that Joe did deserve
Alec's wrath.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.856
We still have ten witnesses
that say he never touched him.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.442
- But he was sitting
right in front of Joe.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.778
- Right, so what's Alec,
a telekinetic vigilante

14:25.907 --> 14:27.317
taking down Haven's scum?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.782
- Doesn't seem like the type.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.526
- No.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.993
Then why would Alec
place himself

14:33.122 --> 14:35.113
at the second crime scene
when we've already seen him

14:35.249 --> 14:36.113
at the first?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.114
- He wouldn't.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.412
- Unless—

14:39.545 --> 14:41.536
unless he can't
control himself.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.300
- Then Joe just started
sliding out of his seat

14:48.429 --> 14:50.090
onto the floor,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.384
like he was getting...

14:52.517 --> 14:54.132
pulled by something

14:54.268 --> 14:56.008
and cut.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.101
- What were you doing
at Joe's office?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.516
- I've been trying
to sell my house.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.855
- You're moving?

15:00.983 --> 15:04.225
- No, itjust seemed
like time to cash out.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.693
But Joe didn't get
any offers.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.232
- That must have pissed you off,

15:07.365 --> 15:09.071
having a guy
who makes that much money

15:09.200 --> 15:10.610
not be able
to help you out.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.279
You're getting a little long
in the tooth.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.618
HoW's the retirement plan
coming?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.031
- What are you talking about?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.745
- I'm talking about
you being tired and mad,

15:16.874 --> 15:18.455
standing in the middle
of two rich guys

15:18.584 --> 15:19.960
who took it on the chin
yesterday.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.872
That's what
I'm talking about, Alec.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.165
- I didn't touch anybody,
and there are witnesses.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.505
- You know, it must be tough
wiping decks for a living,

15:26.634 --> 15:29.171
catering to a bunch
of rich slobs,

15:29.303 --> 15:31.168
and then making your daughter
schlep them drinks

15:31.305 --> 15:33.591
while they look her up
and down like a piece of meat.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.635
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:40.148 --> 15:41.354
- My fault.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.347
I'm sorry.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.770
- What if you had gotten him
mad and something did happen?

15:45.903 --> 15:48.189
- A bucket of cold water.
It works on dogs.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.529
Anyway, he didn't
hulk out on us,

15:50.658 --> 15:52.194
so obviously
he's not our guy.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.487
- Wow, it's damn near
scientific.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.326
- Okay, have you ever had
a situation, though,

15:56.456 --> 15:57.866
like this before,
you know, when Haven

15:57.999 --> 15:59.580
was dealing with
the troubles back then?

15:59.709 --> 16:00.869
- What do you mean?

16:01.002 --> 16:03.664
- Both of our victims
were real dirtbags,

16:03.796 --> 16:05.332
con artists,
so this whole thing,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.672
it just—it feels pointed,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.791
like someone's in control
of what they're doing.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.463
- Couldn't that
be a good thing?

16:11.596 --> 16:14.633
- Yeah, or a very,
very bad thing.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.012
- Lab results
on that black substance.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.931
Atomized graphite.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.054
- Graphite,
like a lubricant?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.727
- Willow charcoal
and a little clay.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.020
- Well, if it was a lubricant,
whatever it was—

16:27.153 --> 16:28.609
- Parker,
it's sketching charcoal.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.784
[bell dings]

16:40.917 --> 16:43.784
- Nathan.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.285
I know why
you're here, love.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.376
- No, you don't, Mary.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.542
- Got your order here.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.757
- Clear varnish
for découpage.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.592
You do découpage?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.633
- Mary, do you sell graphite
and willow charcoal?

16:56.766 --> 16:57.630
- Yeah.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.802
- Where do you découpage,
Wuornos?

16:58.935 --> 17:01.221
- Someplace private.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.891
So graphite
and willow-based charcoal?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.561
- Dusty but has nice,
rich luster.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.558
Gives great shadows.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.946
- Anybody in town buy it?

17:11.072 --> 17:12.562
- I'm not great with records.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.950
I could print you out a copy
of my restocking report.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.782
Maybe I made a note
of who bought it when.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.072
- That would be great.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.657
- What—what is découpage?

17:24.794 --> 17:27.501
And why do you varnish
the pictures?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.416
- It tints all the colors.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.005
It connects them.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.339
- So because you can't feel,

17:32.468 --> 17:33.924
all your other senses
like sight,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.088
they're elevated.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.381
- Yep.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.924
For instance,
right now my hearing

17:38.057 --> 17:39.467
seems very acute.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.761
- Hey, I'm just trying
to get to know you, all right?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.976
How are we supposed
to get to know each other

17:44.105 --> 17:45.561
if we never talk?

17:45.690 --> 17:47.851
You can ask me stuff
if you want.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.521
Go ahead.
I'm an open book.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.268
Hit me. Shoot.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.645
- What do you think
about Jimmy?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.282
- Jimmy?

17:55.408 --> 17:58.024
- He bought willow charcoal.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.661
- Well, I heard Alec
bossing him around

17:59.787 --> 18:00.947
on the boat the other day

18:01.080 --> 18:02.786
and then barking at him
in front of Vickie.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.121
- You think
that's reason enough

18:04.250 --> 18:06.332
to set up your father-in-law
for murder?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.451
- Maybe, but if Jimmy knows
that we're on to him

18:08.588 --> 18:11.625
and he's the guy
that's doing all this—

18:11.757 --> 18:14.794
- Telekinetic slicing
and breaking of people.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.463
- Yeah, then he's not
exactly the kind of guy

18:16.596 --> 18:18.177
we can just walk on up to
and Mirandize him.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.796
- No.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.797
- So we need
to sneak up on him.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.970
- Now what exactly
do you want me to do?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.344
- Use your boat to get close
to The Endorfin.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.187
A police boat is just gonna
stick out like a sore thumb.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.978
- Hmm.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.101
You remember when
I asked you to help me

18:33.237 --> 18:34.317
with those parking tickets?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.153
You turned me down.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.738
- This is more important
than parking tickets.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.778
- That's a matter
of perspective, Nathan.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.195
Those things get expensive.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.911
- Duke, seriously,

18:44.040 --> 18:46.201
I'm just asking for a favor.

18:46.334 --> 18:50.168
- I'm sensing
a dangerous trend here.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.331
[sighs]

18:51.464 --> 18:52.419
Truth?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.209
- That would be nice.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.834
- The Endorfin is
a high-end fishing charter.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.756
It takes out
big-ticket customers

18:59.889 --> 19:01.595
who want big-ticket items.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.339
I can get those things.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.841
- You do business
with them?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.353
- Yeah.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.140
In fact, I'm getting them

19:08.272 --> 19:10.854
a delivery of some
very expensive noble grape.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.063
Don't worry, Nathan.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.024
I paid the customs fees.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.189
- And so protecting
your business with the owner

19:16.322 --> 19:18.358
is more important
than helping us?

19:20.534 --> 19:24.197
- I mean, does it have
to be an either/or?

19:24.330 --> 19:27.788
- Come on.
I have another idea.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.451
- Good luck.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.087
- 50ccs of diazepam.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.882
Drops a grizzly bear
in ten seconds.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.972
- Do you have
anything stronger?

19:45.101 --> 19:47.217
What, we don't know
who we're up against.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.218
- We're just gonna
talk to him.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.720
- Yeah, but if anything
happens to us,

19:50.856 --> 19:51.936
just tranq him.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.227
- Anything like what?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.646
- You know, like we start
bleeding or screaming,

19:56.779 --> 19:57.894
or stuff like that.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.895
- And if it gets dangerous—

20:00.032 --> 20:02.239
- I put it in his neck,
fastest place.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.575
- I was gonna say "run."

20:04.704 --> 20:06.069
Jess, I don't want you
at risk here.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.240
This isn't your job.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.580
- Okay, I'm fine.
Happy to help you.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.243
- Not the date
you were expecting, is it?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.837
- But it's coming up,
right?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.957
- Right.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.851
Hey, Jimmy.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.595
- Hey.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.018
- What are you doing?

20:35.151 --> 20:37.187
- What I'm always doing
on Captain Richards' boat.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.446
I'm making it perfect
for his clients.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.279
- That would drive me crazy.
- What?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.818
- You know, just having
to spend the day

20:43.951 --> 20:45.111
with a bunch
of tourist fat cats

20:45.244 --> 20:46.575
telling me what to do.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.944
That's not fair.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.366
- Yeah, I know.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.490
You wouldn't believe
some of their—

20:55.629 --> 20:57.620
- Jimmy?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.087
Jimmy, what's wrong?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.468
- Oh, my God.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.151
- [muffled shouting]

21:37.713 --> 21:42.377
- There, that should keep him
sedated for a while.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.841
You, uh—

21:43.969 --> 21:45.550
you want some?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.419
- I'm fine.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.137
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.177
I didn't want to take him
to the hospital.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.675
- Yeah, they wouldn't
take him anyway

21:52.812 --> 21:55.178
with no health insurance.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.350
You did the right thing
bringing him here.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.020
On some levels,

22:00.152 --> 22:01.813
he is the perfect houseguest.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.026
- You can joke about this?

22:06.158 --> 22:08.695
- I can always joke.

22:08.828 --> 22:13.071
How else does one get through
a winter in Haven, Maine?

22:13.207 --> 22:15.539
- It's the troubles,
isn't it?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.999
- Yeah, I guess so.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.706
- Wait.
Why are they here?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.380
- [chuckles]

22:26.512 --> 22:27.877
I don't know.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.925
Maybe it's some kind of
cosmic test of our character.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.969
- Well, if this is a test,

22:33.102 --> 22:35.263
you get an A-plus,
and I get a "You suck."

22:35.396 --> 22:37.102
- Oh, you're doing fine.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.220
-lam?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.393
- Yeah.
- Really?

22:40.526 --> 22:43.268
Because to be honest with you,
I'm kind of freakin'.

22:43.404 --> 22:47.238
There is something attacking
people intentionally,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.322
and it, whatever it is,

22:49.451 --> 22:52.318
it knows that I am onto it.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.115
And...

22:54.248 --> 22:56.580
well, the FBI, they never
trained me for the troubles.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.574
- I suppose not.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.248
- God, why can't I just
walk away from this town?

23:01.380 --> 23:02.244
- Well, you could,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.872
but we both know Haven
has its charms.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.255
Audrey, is that what
you really want,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.470
to leave,
go back to the FBI?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.840
- I want to find this thing.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.182
- And?

23:17.271 --> 23:19.728
- And I want
to kick its ass.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.242
- ls Jimmy going to be okay?

23:41.378 --> 23:44.962
- I don't know.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.297
You saw that weirdness.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.669
- Yeah, and I thought
you were really brave.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.306
- What did I do
that was brave?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.640
- You didn't pee yourself.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.351
- You should go home, Jess.
- Really?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.141
Why?
I can help.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.138
- How?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.483
Hmm?
How can you help?

24:06.612 --> 24:07.692
There's a guy
in the next room

24:07.821 --> 24:09.106
who just lost his face.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.481
There's another
down at the morgue

24:12.618 --> 24:14.825
who was shredded.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.161
I'm in the middle
of a freak show here.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.952
This isn't any place
for a normal girl

24:21.085 --> 24:22.950
with good intentions.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.123
- You came to me.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.995
- Yeah.
I shouldn't have.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.123
You should go.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.712
- Fine.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.803
See you around.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.191
- Guess what subject
Vickie teaches.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.735
Art.

24:53.867 --> 24:54.993
- Vickie.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.708
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.418
[knocking at door]

25:14.221 --> 25:15.722
- Can we talk for a minute?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.179
- Is this about my father?

25:17.307 --> 25:18.888
- No.
What about your father?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.554
- Uh, nothing.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.098
I, uh, I couldn't
reach him earlier.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.391
I'm sure he just forgot
to charge his cell phone again.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.731
- You're lying.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.896
- Look, I'm in the middle
of class.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.610
- We could always ask you
to join us at the station,

25:31.739 --> 25:32.979
and we could talk there.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.401
- You can't make me go anywhere
unless you arrest me.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.115
- Hey, Vickie,
if you need some help—

25:37.244 --> 25:39.326
- If you want to help me,
leave me alone.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.364
I have to get back
to my class.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.757
- Really?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.215
'We can always ask you
to join us at the station

25:53.343 --> 25:54.924
if you want to talk there."

25:55.054 --> 25:56.419
- Oh.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.841
She's worried about her dad.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.886
And I'm betting she doesn't
know what happened to Jimmy.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.260
- She's definitely
hiding something.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.932
- Yeah, well,
whatever it is,

26:06.065 --> 26:09.307
maybe we can find evidence of it
at her house.

26:16.617 --> 26:20.280
There's no law against
looking in windows.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.744
Or against checking
for locks.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.990
- Parker.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.329
Look at that.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.001
- Blankets in the windows?

26:33.133 --> 26:35.215
Somebody's definitely
hiding something.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.027
- Looks like somebody
trashed the place.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.699
- Yeah, that's too bad,

27:04.832 --> 27:07.289
'cause some of these
are really good.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.676
crash!

27:16.802 --> 27:18.167
[gasps]

27:24.852 --> 27:26.308
Wind.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.848
- Inside.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.312
Sure.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.821
- Looks like somebody
took these in a hurry.

27:39.950 --> 27:43.488
- Or stolen.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.156
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hmm?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.780
- Here's a finished one
someone forgot.

27:52.129 --> 27:55.371
Look familiar?

27:55.507 --> 27:56.667
Nathan!

28:07.519 --> 28:08.508
- Thank you.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.510
All right, Vickie
just left the school,

28:10.647 --> 28:11.727
and I put out
an APB.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.222
We can arrest her now.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.895
- I agree we should,
but for what?

28:16.028 --> 28:18.735
- Illegal manufacture
and use of voodoo drawings.

28:18.864 --> 28:22.732
When I touched your image—
- I was there.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.483
- Right.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.906
So I'm guessing
that Wallace was folded

28:27.039 --> 28:29.075
and Santomauro was shredded.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.746
- And Jimmy got erased?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.118
- The question is:

28:34.254 --> 28:36.916
Where are all the other people
that she sketched?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.880
- Not just people.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.170
I stepped on this.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.265
The drawings
affect things too.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.258
- But why is she scared
if she's in control?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.101
- And why use her drawings
to go after Jimmy

28:52.231 --> 28:54.313
and a banker
and a realtor?

28:54.441 --> 28:55.476
- Let's ask.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.600
The banker's probably
conscious now.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.068
- No, wait, wait.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.609
I don't want to leave this
here unguarded,

29:03.742 --> 29:05.824
but I don't want
to touch it either.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.534
- So what do you want to do?

29:07.663 --> 29:10.780
- I'll call Settle.
Ask him to come watch it.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.998
- And are you gonna
tell him why?

29:13.126 --> 29:15.162
- 'Cause I think
it's really good.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.251
- [chuckles]

29:28.558 --> 29:30.139
- Mr. Wallace.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.305
- If you're lawyers
from the boat company,

29:32.437 --> 29:33.688
save your breath
unless you've got

29:33.814 --> 29:34.974
a 30 mil settlement
in your pocket.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.313
- We're cops.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.306
- You figure out
what happened to me yet?

29:38.443 --> 29:39.649
- Yeah.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.234
What we want to know is why.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.228
- Well, I want to know
what first.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.819
attached to tubes.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.488
We could leave.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.284
Now.

29:54.668 --> 29:57.410
Okay, see ya.

29:57.546 --> 30:00.413
- I was gonna pay
the money I owed.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.540
- To who?

30:02.676 --> 30:03.711
Vickie?

30:03.844 --> 30:05.004
- Vickie?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.593
No.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.586
Richards.

30:07.723 --> 30:08.929
- Captain Richards?

30:09.057 --> 30:11.389
- I only owed him
200 large.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.884
300, whatever.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.013
Suddenly he was a maniac
about collecting it.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.561
Normally he's happy
to earn the interest.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.355
- You owed him $300,000
from fishing?

30:22.487 --> 30:24.864
- No, I owe him 300,000
because of a stupid parlay

30:24.990 --> 30:26.901
and the Jets
can't make a field goal.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.194
- Whoa, you bet on the Jets?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.033
- What about Joe Santomauro?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.743
Did he owe Richards money too?

30:31.872 --> 30:33.408
- Probably.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.781
I saw him out there
a few times.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.408
Worst poker player ever.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.456
But I think they had
a real estate deal cooking.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.877
Based on what I heard
about Joe,

30:44.009 --> 30:47.172
guessing it went south.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.920
- So The Endorfin's more than
just a fishing charter?

30:50.057 --> 30:51.718
- Oh, he's fishing.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.556
For guys like me.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.061
Rich enough to have
a couple of drinks

30:55.187 --> 30:56.552
and get in hock with him.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.394
-So...

30:58.523 --> 31:02.186
Vickie is muscle
for Richards?

31:02.319 --> 31:04.230
- Let's go ask why.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.070
Patrol car picked her up.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.406
- What about me?

31:09.534 --> 31:12.241
- You got involved
with the wrong kind of people.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.659
- Like I don't know that.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.968
- Hey, Vickie.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.804
Why are you drawing that?

31:32.933 --> 31:34.514
- It's pretty.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.259
- No, that's not why.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.136
We know what you can do.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.604
- And we know
you're working for Richards.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.440
- I'm sorry, I have
no idea what you're talking—

31:44.569 --> 31:46.105
- No, what we don't know

31:46.238 --> 31:47.648
is why you drew Jimmy.

31:47.781 --> 31:51.649
- J-Jimmy?

31:51.785 --> 31:53.150
Is he okay?

31:53.286 --> 31:54.662
- He's okay.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.120
- I don't want to do this.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.614
I tried to stop.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.661
- So why don't you?

32:00.794 --> 32:03.035
- My dad.

32:03.171 --> 32:07.756
Richards,
he has my dad hostage.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.258
A few days ago, I went down
to the boat to sketch.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.351
I used to like sketching.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.857
There was a seal
on the pier.

32:22.983 --> 32:26.475
I drew it,
gave it to Richards.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.693
He crumpled it.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.813
We both saw what happened.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.315
- And he figured out
what your sketches could do.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.864
- He came to see me
the next day

32:35.996 --> 32:38.988
and said that my dad
had been gambling on his boat,

32:39.124 --> 32:40.455
owed a lot of money,

32:40.584 --> 32:43.326
that he'd be working
for free forever,

32:43.462 --> 32:45.828
but that I could help
pay off my dad's debt

32:45.964 --> 32:47.500
by giving him some sketches.

32:47.632 --> 32:51.750
He was only gonna use them
to pressure people.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.845
I know how hard
my dad works.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.680
- So you drew.

32:57.809 --> 33:01.051
- Yes, but when Richards
started hurting people,

33:01.188 --> 33:03.850
I told him
I wouldn't do it anymore.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.689
So he got mad.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.729
He grabbed my dad

33:08.862 --> 33:13.196
and told me that if I didn't
draw this place by 5:00,

33:13.325 --> 33:16.112
he was gonna kill him.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.326
- Why this place?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.573
- I know he tried
to buy it recently.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.540
- Well, that would explain
why he tried to collect

33:24.669 --> 33:26.705
all that money so suddenly
from Wallace.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.500
- And why Joe Santomauro,
his real estate agent,

33:29.633 --> 33:31.715
got punished when he couldn't
make the deal happen.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.129
- And so if Richards
couldn't buy this place...

33:34.262 --> 33:36.674
- He's gonna use her drawings
to destroy it.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.049
- All right, why didn't you
just draw a picture of Richards?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.392
- I did.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.887
But the only sketch that works
is the first one I draw.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.059
Richards has the one
I did of him

33:47.192 --> 33:49.057
hidden on that boat.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.310
- And why did you draw Jimmy?

33:51.446 --> 33:53.858
- l—l drew him before

33:53.990 --> 33:55.981
I knew any of this
was happening.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.109
I drew a bunch of people.
I drew half the town.

33:59.246 --> 34:03.285
When Richards came
and took my dad,

34:03.416 --> 34:05.748
he took all of my sketches.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.333
- If he has
all the sketches,

34:07.462 --> 34:10.420
he could hurt someone
before we take him down.

34:10.549 --> 34:14.588
- Not just someone.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.303
He has a landscape that I did

34:18.431 --> 34:20.387
from up on King's Point.

34:22.727 --> 34:25.810
- Hello?
Out-of-towner.

34:25.939 --> 34:27.770
What's King's Point?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.514
- It's the lookout spot.

34:29.651 --> 34:32.518
You can see the whole town
from up there.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.895
Remember the vase?

34:37.075 --> 34:39.862
- I better call
for backup.

34:45.667 --> 34:46.827
- Afternoon.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.463
Permission to come aboard.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.010
All right,
I'll knock next time.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.299
- Duke.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.968
What are you bringing me?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.263
- Well, today...

35:05.395 --> 35:10.685
I have got a lovely
'68 Chateau La Tour.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.852
Old-growth vines.

35:11.985 --> 35:14.226
Unfortunately for them
but fortunately for us,

35:14.362 --> 35:16.478
it disappeared from
a French farmer's cellar

35:16.615 --> 35:17.855
after he croaked.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.322
- And hoW'd you get it?

35:19.451 --> 35:20.907
- Excuse me?

35:21.036 --> 35:23.027
- What?

35:23.163 --> 35:24.903
- [chuckles]

35:25.040 --> 35:27.031
I just thought
that we kind of agreed

35:27.167 --> 35:28.202
if we were gonna do business,

35:28.335 --> 35:29.825
we wouldn't ask
a lot of questions.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.872
- That's exactly why
I like dealing with you.

35:32.005 --> 35:32.960
- Hmm.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.078
- HoW's three grand sound?

35:34.215 --> 35:36.501
- Uh, five sounds better.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.593
- And four gets her done?

35:39.721 --> 35:42.087
- Yes, it does.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.509
Keep it cool.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.180
Hate to blow
40 years in a cellar.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.724
- You know, I think things
are really gonna start

35:49.856 --> 35:51.187
picking up for me.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.681
Could probably do
a lot more business

35:52.817 --> 35:54.682
if you're interested.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.229
- Oh, I'm always interested.

35:56.363 --> 35:59.150
- All righty then.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.198
l have company.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.036
You know them?

36:07.165 --> 36:10.874
- Uh, yeah,
unfortunately, I do.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.209
It would probably
be better for both of us

36:13.338 --> 36:14.874
if they didn't see me here.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.337
- Okay.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.172
Put these
in the cold box below.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.678
- All right.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.069
- Vickie.
Detectives.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.238
- We know what you did
to Wallace and Santomauro.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.077
- I'm
s
o
rry?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.366
What?

36:49.499 --> 36:50.989
- We want to make a deal.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.787
- Vickie, you got an agent.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.159
[chuckles]

36:54.295 --> 36:57.583
I'm a businessman.
What deal?

36:57.716 --> 36:58.956
- Give us
all her pictures,

36:59.092 --> 36:59.956
and we won't shoot you.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.458
- She's not very good.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.459
She should know
knowledge is power.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.928
And she should know

37:06.057 --> 37:08.343
that I hold all the cards.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.761
Hmm?

37:13.898 --> 37:16.480
Now you give me
what I asked for,

37:16.609 --> 37:19.692
and you two go away.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.451
Or better yet,

37:25.577 --> 37:26.783
Vickie,

37:26.911 --> 37:28.287
draw them.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.368
- You're not hearing me.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.577
- No.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.244
You're not hearing me.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.471
- [sobs]

37:48.600 --> 37:50.886
- You hearing me now?

37:59.778 --> 38:00.984
- You really think
you can kill me

38:01.112 --> 38:03.649
before I crumple this,
destroy the whole town?

38:03.782 --> 38:05.113
- No.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.239
- Hey, this really works.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.706
- What took you so long?

38:15.835 --> 38:16.995
- I'm sorry.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.870
But it takes me a second
to pick a safe.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.997
- Well, that's a shock.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.669
- Besides,
I had to pry open the door

38:23.802 --> 38:26.134
to get that guy out.
- Daddy.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.423
- I don't want this anymore.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.545
- Uh-huh.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.021
- Parker, hold this.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.560
Be careful with it.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.728
- The picture.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.442
- Daddy.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.062
[sobbing]

38:46.199 --> 38:49.566
- [straining and gurgling]

38:58.503 --> 39:00.084
- [sobbing]

39:02.757 --> 39:04.497
- I can't get...

39:04.634 --> 39:08.377
I can't get it.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.502
Damn it.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.908
- Here, I thought
you might like these.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.494
- Ooh, these aren't
decorations.

39:35.623 --> 39:36.999
- God, no.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.410
- Well, good, 'cause,
you know,

39:38.543 --> 39:41.535
I got a kind of funky Mexican
farmhouse thing going on.

39:41.671 --> 39:44.083
I don't want it to clash.

39:44.215 --> 39:48.379
I'll be extra careful
with these.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.752
Jimmy's recovering.
He looks pretty good.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.255
- Yeah, he had a little help
from his fiancée.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.723
Do you think
he's going to be okay?

39:55.852 --> 39:59.219
- Yeah, I do.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.607
Audrey.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.065
You kicked its ass.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.645
- Nathan.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.808
- Hey, Jess.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.648
- Are you okay?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.439
- Yeah.

40:51.407 --> 40:54.114
Came to see
about that prowler.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.205
- Really?

40:58.331 --> 41:00.117
It's not too dangerous?

41:00.249 --> 41:02.740
- I hope not.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.771
- Dirty martini number two.

41:27.902 --> 41:31.019
So are these happy martinis

41:31.155 --> 41:32.486
or sad martinis?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.526
- It's because
I want to thank you,

41:34.659 --> 41:36.365
but that seems
almost impossible.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.529
So I figure
with a big bill

41:37.662 --> 41:38.993
at least I can give you
a good tip.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.033
- [chuckles]

41:41.165 --> 41:42.701
All right.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.790
- No seriously,
thank you, Duke,

41:44.919 --> 41:46.204
for coming through
when I called.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.669
- Sure.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.176
Now, about those
parking tickets...

41:55.304 --> 41:57.135
[both laugh]

42:00.518 --> 42:04.727
So why is it so hard
for you to thank me?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.221
- I don't know.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.393
Maybe 'cause every time we
start to be nice to each other

42:08.526 --> 42:09.766
something blows it up.

42:09.902 --> 42:14.191
- Maybe you just ask
way too much of me.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.065
I mean, the poking around,
the judging.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.534
The secret to happiness
with men?

42:22.582 --> 42:24.072
Lower your expectations.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.869
- Everybody knows that.

42:26.002 --> 42:29.039
- Why can't you do it?

42:29.172 --> 42:31.413
- I'm drinking this swill,
aren't I?

42:33.009 --> 42:34.795
- [laughs]
