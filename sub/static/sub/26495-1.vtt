02:07.585 --> 02:11.887
And now, for an evening
of psychic entertainment...

02:11.889 --> 02:15.223
bring your hands together,
and open your hearts.

02:15.225 --> 02:18.529
Please welcome...
Michael Vaughn.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.621
Brian is asking me to take
your hand. May I?

02:50.294 --> 02:53.428
Your son loved animals,
didn't he?

02:53.430 --> 02:55.764
Oh, yes, he rode horses
his entire life...

02:55.766 --> 02:57.566
right up until the end.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.936
And I'm seeing... he's showing me
one horse in particular.

03:00.938 --> 03:05.640
It's a shiny, dark coat,
brown or black, maybe.

03:05.642 --> 03:09.443
When he was a kid, we had
a brown mare named Indy.

03:09.445 --> 03:10.779
Gorgeous animal.

03:10.781 --> 03:12.047
You're seeing Indy?

03:12.049 --> 03:13.715
Well, it's pretty tough
to miss her.

03:13.717 --> 03:15.954
Brian's only riding her 24-7.

03:17.987 --> 03:20.389
And you know what else?

03:20.391 --> 03:23.491
You've never seen a smile
like the one on his face.

03:23.493 --> 03:29.398
There's no more pain,
there's only joy...

03:29.400 --> 03:32.633
but with the joy, I am
seeing a stone wall.

03:32.635 --> 03:34.936
And when I'm shown a wall or a
fence, it usually means...

03:34.938 --> 03:38.440
it was a guarded relationship,
maybe some things left unsaid.

03:38.442 --> 03:42.744
Plenty of love there... but it
was rarely expressed.

03:42.746 --> 03:46.747
Wasn't your idea to come
tonight, was it, Earl?

03:46.749 --> 03:48.349
No, it sure wasn't.

03:48.351 --> 03:50.718
- Cynthia.
- It's okay.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.422
It's in your nature
to be skeptical.

03:53.424 --> 03:55.524
You're a practical man who
doesn't like the idea...

03:55.526 --> 03:56.924
of some fast-talking
out-of-towner...

03:56.926 --> 03:58.759
digging into his personal
affairs.

03:58.761 --> 04:00.961
But the fact that you let
Cynthia drag you here tonight...

04:00.963 --> 04:03.899
that tells me that you've
got a big heart, Earl...

04:03.901 --> 04:07.102
that you'd do anything
for your family.

04:07.104 --> 04:09.471
Brian knows that, too...

04:09.473 --> 04:11.943
and it means a heck of a lot
to him that you're here.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.377
Now that you've got him here...

04:15.379 --> 04:16.914
is there anything you want
to say to your son?

04:20.517 --> 04:22.883
I love him.

04:22.885 --> 04:24.856
Tell him directly.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.857
I love you, Brian.

04:29.859 --> 04:31.826
Tell him like you really
mean it, Earl.

04:31.828 --> 04:34.398
Tell him like you wish you had
before he crossed over.

04:36.433 --> 04:41.570
I love you, boy,
and I miss you so much.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.005
Brian loves you, too.

04:44.007 --> 04:46.941
But you gotta chip away
at that stone wall.

04:46.943 --> 04:49.710
Not just for Brian's sake,
for the sake of your children...

04:49.712 --> 04:51.078
that haven't crossed over yet.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.381
You do have other children,
don't you?

04:52.383 --> 04:53.582
Yes, two girls.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.383
You gotta do it for your
daughters, Earl.

04:55.385 --> 04:57.385
Yeah, yeah.

04:57.387 --> 04:59.453
And for that grandson...

04:59.455 --> 05:02.991
who's gonna be joining
your family soon.

05:02.993 --> 05:05.426
You see a grandson on the way?

05:05.428 --> 05:07.162
I may have said too much.

05:07.164 --> 05:09.067
Thank you both for coming
tonight.

05:14.938 --> 05:17.905
I've got a strong male spirit
coming in...

05:17.907 --> 05:19.474
for someone in this section.

05:19.476 --> 05:21.910
The first name starts
with a "juh" sound.

05:21.912 --> 05:25.750
So, either a J or a G. Maybe a
John, a Jeffrey, a Jim.

05:27.183 --> 05:28.820
Sir, is this connecting
with you?

05:30.520 --> 05:33.487
Are you sure?

05:33.489 --> 05:39.763
This is a father or a father-
type figure. Jacob. George.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.931
Definitely for someone
in this section.

05:42.933 --> 05:46.133
I've got a lot of images
coming through.

05:46.135 --> 05:47.736
Okay, I'm gonna leave
that one then.

05:47.738 --> 05:48.903
I've got a feeling he'll
be back.

05:48.905 --> 05:50.838
This guy's got a lot to say.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.708
Folks, I want to help connect
you with your loved ones...

05:53.710 --> 05:55.844
but I can't do that if you're
not making yourselves available.

05:55.846 --> 05:59.713
So please remain open and ready
to accept connections.

05:59.715 --> 06:01.849
All right?

06:01.851 --> 06:05.753
Um, I have an older female
spirit coming in...

06:05.755 --> 06:07.022
for someone in this section.

06:07.024 --> 06:09.758
They want me to talk
to a Debbie or Darlene.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.527
Does anyone in this section
have a name like that?

06:12.529 --> 06:14.496
My name's Debra.

06:14.498 --> 06:19.534
Debra, why is this spirit
showing me an album cover...

06:19.536 --> 06:21.503
for the Mamas and the Papas?

06:21.505 --> 06:25.773
Oh my god, my grandmother's
name is Cassy.

06:25.775 --> 06:30.578
We always called her
'Mama Cass.'

06:30.580 --> 06:33.484
Well, say hello to your Mama
Cass, she's in the room with us.

06:41.657 --> 06:43.525
Uh, do you have a copy
of my book?

06:43.527 --> 06:47.796
Printer says they're having
trouble keeping up with demand.

06:47.798 --> 06:52.202
Is there a place online where
I could maybe get it cheaper?

06:53.904 --> 06:56.505
Hey, I'll tell you what,
that one is on me.

06:56.507 --> 06:57.905
Are you serious?

06:57.907 --> 06:59.508
Only if you promise to bring
that husband...

06:59.510 --> 07:01.142
the next time I come
through town.

07:01.144 --> 07:04.111
I absolutely will.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.616
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

07:09.652 --> 07:10.919
Mike.

07:10.921 --> 07:12.587
How you doing?

07:12.589 --> 07:14.222
Oh, can't complain.

07:14.224 --> 07:15.857
Where's Mom?

07:15.859 --> 07:17.659
She's at home, getting ready
for tomorrow.

07:17.661 --> 07:19.126
We've got two services
in the morning.

07:19.128 --> 07:22.530
No rest for the pastor's family.

07:22.532 --> 07:24.965
Well, she missed a good one.

07:24.967 --> 07:27.669
Plenty of, uh... strong
connections.

07:27.671 --> 07:30.571
Want to take her a souvenir?

07:30.573 --> 07:32.576
A calendar with my face on it?

07:37.179 --> 07:38.946
Publisher said they were
gonna send you...

07:38.948 --> 07:40.684
a couple copies of that,
did you get them?

07:42.152 --> 07:45.089
I believe we did, yeah.

07:46.789 --> 07:48.092
Good.

07:49.226 --> 07:50.691
Have you heard from your
brother?

07:50.693 --> 07:52.626
He said he left a couple
messages.

07:52.628 --> 07:55.030
Yeah, I owe him a call.

07:55.032 --> 07:59.234
Been pretty busy, the tour,
and the book...

07:59.236 --> 08:01.570
He and the family were out
over Easter.

08:01.572 --> 08:04.972
Sounds like he's got more than
he can handle at work right now.

08:04.974 --> 08:08.912
He said he might be able to use
someone with your talents.

08:10.147 --> 08:12.179
Really?

08:12.181 --> 08:14.748
Is he selling townhouses
to dead people now?

08:14.750 --> 08:18.753
I believe it's your power
of persuasion he had in mind.

08:18.755 --> 08:23.090
Nice of him to think of me,
but my hands are pretty full.

08:23.092 --> 08:24.825
I got a lot of cities
to go to...

08:24.827 --> 08:26.895
a lot of people counting
on my help.

08:26.897 --> 08:32.967
Mike, when you were a birthday
party magician...

08:32.970 --> 08:35.773
at least those folks knew they
were being bullshitted.

08:41.144 --> 08:42.947
Don't forget this one.

08:44.246 --> 08:46.150
I'll give Mom your best.

08:53.390 --> 08:54.955
Hey, double scotch
on the rocks, please.

08:54.957 --> 08:56.291
Uh, what's your brand?

08:56.293 --> 08:57.928
Cheapest.

09:33.029 --> 09:37.431
Oh, hello, Mr. Vaughn, your show
tonight was something else.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.334
Stay in my room tonight.

09:39.336 --> 09:42.737
Well, that's very forward
of you, but I'm afraid I...

09:42.739 --> 09:44.875
Cut the shit, Chelsea, please.

09:46.776 --> 09:48.375
What are you doing?

09:48.377 --> 09:50.246
39.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.782
Could we do this somewhere else?

09:53.784 --> 09:55.115
But we filled 39 whole seats
tonight.

09:55.117 --> 09:57.451
That's cause for celebration.

09:57.453 --> 10:00.021
The turnout was bound to be
light, it's our first time here.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.422
And our last time here.

10:01.424 --> 10:03.291
Go to bed, Michael.

10:03.293 --> 10:05.225
Let's just admit this
is not working.

10:05.227 --> 10:09.064
We have a calendar full of
shows... we have a book out.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.998
That nobody's buying.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.768
By this point, John Edward was
on TV every night of the week.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.204
He that compares is he that
despairs.

10:16.206 --> 10:21.341
And she that speaks in annoying
rhymes is... you.

10:21.343 --> 10:23.077
Where's the waitress?

10:23.079 --> 10:25.846
Look, you're gonna get
what you want...

10:25.848 --> 10:27.449
as long as we stay the course.

10:27.451 --> 10:29.417
And that means following
the rules.

10:29.419 --> 10:32.353
Like, you don't drag me into a
reading unless you're sunk.

10:32.355 --> 10:34.388
I'm sunk.

10:34.390 --> 10:36.423
I've put the same amount
of years into this as you.

10:36.425 --> 10:38.125
You don't get to hang it up...

10:38.127 --> 10:39.829
because Daddy didn't say he was
proud of you tonight.

10:41.264 --> 10:42.997
How are we doing here?

10:42.999 --> 10:44.264
Another white wine for you,
ma'am?

10:44.266 --> 10:45.966
No, we're good here.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.936
No, we are not good here.
I'm still drinking.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.071
I'd like a double scotch
on the rocks, please.

10:50.073 --> 10:51.141
Got it.

10:54.910 --> 10:58.848
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
I said it like that.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.789
Stay with me tonight.

11:09.058 --> 11:10.892
We're not starting that
up again.

11:10.894 --> 11:15.363
Come on, it'll be our final
farewell, our big closer.

11:15.365 --> 11:18.166
Please don't be hungover
in the morning.

11:18.168 --> 11:20.837
It's a long drive to Tucson.

11:22.404 --> 11:24.305
I'm not going to Tucson.

11:24.307 --> 11:26.508
8:00 AM, down in the lobby.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.712
It's been an absolute pleasure,
Miss Mills.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.114
Thank you kindly, Debra...

11:34.116 --> 11:36.920
for attending my evening
of psychic entertainment!

11:59.943 --> 12:01.912
Son of a bitch!

12:27.871 --> 12:29.874
Sorry, man, did I hit
your car?

13:03.340 --> 13:05.276
Hello?

13:11.881 --> 13:13.580
What is this?

13:16.086 --> 13:17.354
You okay?

13:20.222 --> 13:23.324
What is this? What's happening?

13:23.326 --> 13:27.832
Remember tonight? Jim?

13:31.233 --> 13:37.138
Oh, look, right... I'm sorry,
there is no Jim.

13:37.140 --> 13:41.542
He showed you what happened,
I can tell.

13:41.544 --> 13:43.677
Here's the deal, I didn't see
anything...

13:43.679 --> 13:46.547
because I can't connect
with dead people.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.516
Naw, naw...

13:48.518 --> 13:54.288
All right, it's a show I do...
or used to do, I'm done with it.

13:54.290 --> 13:57.124
People aren't just done
being psychic.

13:57.126 --> 13:59.426
No, I'm telling you that
I'm not psychic.

13:59.428 --> 14:01.696
I came to your work tonight.

14:01.698 --> 14:05.966
I know the real deal
when I see it.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.101
All right, you want to know how
I pulled the name "Jim"?

14:08.103 --> 14:09.637
Michael.

14:09.639 --> 14:11.272
Because nearly everyone knows
a male with a J name.

14:11.274 --> 14:12.473
It's a statistical fact!

14:12.475 --> 14:13.508
That's enough from you.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.209
I play the odds...

14:15.211 --> 14:16.543
until someone in the audience
fills in the blanks.

14:16.545 --> 14:18.982
Stop fucking with me!

14:21.583 --> 14:25.289
Are you done fucking with me?

14:40.135 --> 14:41.938
Sorry... I'm sorry.

14:45.241 --> 14:51.981
I'm just a little overwhelmed
with this.

14:54.317 --> 14:57.185
But um, you know...

14:57.187 --> 15:03.590
I am starting to remember some
impressions that Jim gave me.

15:03.592 --> 15:06.393
What impressions?

15:06.395 --> 15:09.162
He said some conflict...

15:09.164 --> 15:11.334
maybe things didn't end very
peacefully between you two.

15:13.068 --> 15:15.570
And that... and that you're
carrying around...

15:15.572 --> 15:17.441
a heavy amount of guilt.

15:20.309 --> 15:22.576
I need you to tell him
something from me.

15:22.578 --> 15:25.448
You can tell him yourself.
He's here with us.

15:37.159 --> 15:42.433
I want you to know
how sorry I am.

15:45.501 --> 15:49.037
I was out of my mind.

15:49.039 --> 15:50.240
If I could do it again...

15:52.141 --> 15:55.143
I would have never left you
without a dad.

15:55.145 --> 15:57.014
There's no way in hell.

16:01.050 --> 16:04.754
He, um, he knows that,
and he forgives you.

16:05.822 --> 16:08.056
He's not upset with me?

16:08.058 --> 16:12.192
No, no, 'cause... 'cause the
people that cross over...

16:12.194 --> 16:16.797
they don't experience those
petty emotions like anger...

16:16.799 --> 16:21.601
and resentment, they don't even
exist where he is.

16:21.603 --> 16:25.406
But he's making it clear that
it's really important to him...

16:25.408 --> 16:28.508
that you let me out of here,
okay?

16:28.510 --> 16:31.180
So, how about we cut me loose?

16:35.318 --> 16:37.618
Where are you going?
Hey, come on, come back!

16:37.620 --> 16:40.289
Why don't you let me go?

16:42.458 --> 16:44.859
Let me go!

16:44.861 --> 16:50.200
Please! Someone... help!

16:51.201 --> 16:52.702
Help!

17:10.652 --> 17:13.523
Michael? It's me.

17:17.560 --> 17:22.230
I'm sorry you had a rough night.

17:22.232 --> 17:24.501
You'll be back on top tomorrow.

17:32.842 --> 17:35.642
Hey, listen...

17:35.644 --> 17:40.083
it would really help if I could
just know your name, you know?

17:41.884 --> 17:43.885
Okay, well, either way,
it means a lot to me...

17:43.887 --> 17:46.721
that you're a fan of my work,
and I want to give you...

17:46.723 --> 17:50.358
something that I rarely offer to
other fans... private reading.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.326
Just the two of us.

17:52.328 --> 17:54.794
You let me out of here, we can
sit down, we can go over all...

17:54.796 --> 17:58.599
this Jim stuff, or anything else
you want to explore.

17:58.601 --> 18:01.269
And if you're worried about me
going to the police...

18:01.271 --> 18:02.837
just forget it.

18:02.839 --> 18:05.173
If I've learned one thing
from the spirit world...

18:05.175 --> 18:07.908
it's that you gotta let things
go, you know what I mean?

18:07.910 --> 18:10.480
It was stupid of me
to come tonight.

18:12.948 --> 18:15.183
What is this stuff,
what are you doing?

18:15.185 --> 18:19.453
I'm really sorry, Michael.
Nobody else can know.

18:19.455 --> 18:23.558
But I don't know!
I didn't see what you did!

18:23.560 --> 18:25.826
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

18:25.828 --> 18:28.428
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Let's talk, let's talk.

18:28.430 --> 18:30.363
We can talk about it, please!
Let's talk.

18:30.365 --> 18:33.434
We can talk about it! Please!
Please don't do this!

18:33.436 --> 18:35.336
Please don't do this!
Please don't do this!

18:35.338 --> 18:36.904
Please!

18:36.906 --> 18:39.372
I-I didn't see anything!
I don't know anything!

18:39.374 --> 18:40.608
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Ja...

18:40.610 --> 18:42.275
Jim needs me! Jim needs me!

18:42.277 --> 18:45.812
For what? What's he need
you for?

18:45.814 --> 18:48.482
He... he needs to talk to his
daughter again.

18:48.484 --> 18:50.685
- Stacy?
- Stacy, yes, Stacy!

18:50.687 --> 18:53.753
She's the whole reason that he
put us together tonight...

18:53.755 --> 18:55.856
because she's still in pain,
he needs me to help her.

18:55.858 --> 18:59.526
So I can help, I can help! I can
make it right, she can move on!

18:59.528 --> 19:02.632
You can both move on, but I
can't help you if you kill me!

19:13.575 --> 19:17.547
Fuck, man, I gotta think.

19:24.553 --> 19:26.590
Try to get some sleep.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.994
My name's Nathan.

19:33.996 --> 19:36.632
Wait, Nathan, hang on!

19:44.740 --> 19:45.875
God...

19:49.544 --> 19:51.646
Damn it, Michael!

20:24.913 --> 20:26.613
How did you sleep?

20:26.615 --> 20:28.715
I didn't.

20:28.717 --> 20:31.388
Yeah, me, too.

20:42.364 --> 20:44.300
How do you like your eggs?

21:21.504 --> 21:22.802
You all right back there?

21:22.804 --> 21:24.608
Uh, yeah, it's all good.

21:32.148 --> 21:36.117
Sorry about the mess,
I wasn't expecting any visitors.

21:36.119 --> 21:37.952
Hey, you don't have
to make me breakfast.

21:37.954 --> 21:39.552
I can just eat at the hotel.

21:39.554 --> 21:41.589
The hotel's too far
out of the way.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.424
We're already falling behind
as it is.

21:43.426 --> 21:44.824
For what?

21:44.826 --> 21:47.128
Stacy.

21:47.130 --> 21:51.001
That map over there, I got the
route all figured out.

21:58.408 --> 21:59.974
Nevada?

21:59.976 --> 22:02.142
Did you know that they call
that The Silver State?

22:02.144 --> 22:05.448
I have two shows in Tucson
tonight. I can't go to Nevada.

22:10.119 --> 22:12.356
So you decided to not quit.

22:14.122 --> 22:16.756
- I guess so.
- That's great.

22:16.758 --> 22:18.525
This shit-hole world
needs your gift.

22:18.527 --> 22:20.727
Which is exactly why I can't
just drop everything...

22:20.729 --> 22:22.562
and head off to... Lone Valley.

22:22.564 --> 22:23.798
It's been 20 years.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.866
He needs to talk to his
daughter.

22:25.868 --> 22:29.436
But, listen, I've got a couple
shows in Reno next month.

22:29.438 --> 22:32.141
I'll shoot over and talk
to Stacy then.

22:34.142 --> 22:38.781
He needs it done...
we go today.

22:40.182 --> 22:41.884
Your huevos.

22:53.196 --> 22:56.030
Okay, bud, we're all gassed up.

22:56.032 --> 22:57.697
Great.

22:57.699 --> 22:58.999
And I hate having to do this...

22:59.001 --> 23:01.234
but we're gonna need a few
rules.

23:01.236 --> 23:03.503
Keep it to the speed limit
at all times.

23:03.505 --> 23:06.072
We only stop when I say
it's okay.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.711
And no calling or communicating
with anybody at any time.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.482
Seat belt.

23:18.854 --> 23:20.553
Why are you back there?

23:20.555 --> 23:22.188
Just in case.

23:22.190 --> 23:23.756
In case of what?

23:23.758 --> 23:26.695
In case you break any
of the rules.

23:50.753 --> 23:53.119
I checked all the local
hospitals, nothing.

23:53.121 --> 23:56.189
The rental place said he hadn't
returned the car.

23:56.191 --> 23:58.157
And how was he acting the last
time you saw him?

23:58.159 --> 24:01.762
He'd been drinking...
we got into it a little.

24:01.764 --> 24:03.696
An altercation?

24:03.698 --> 24:06.300
A disagreement, nothing serious.

24:06.302 --> 24:10.169
Do you know a reason why anyone
would want to harm Mr. Vaughn?

24:10.171 --> 24:12.939
Not that I can think of.

24:12.941 --> 24:15.544
He helps people for a living.

24:23.052 --> 24:24.984
Money.

24:24.986 --> 24:26.887
Huh?

24:26.889 --> 24:29.892
I'm seeing money, that's what
it's about, right?

24:31.060 --> 24:33.193
What are you talking about?

24:33.195 --> 24:35.963
Jim is showing me a dispute
over money...

24:35.965 --> 24:38.735
or something of value.

24:41.571 --> 24:43.640
Slow down.

24:45.908 --> 24:48.809
You don't have to tell me,
I just feel like...

24:48.811 --> 24:52.846
as your partner in this thing,
it's something I should know.

24:52.848 --> 24:54.814
But, I'm sure Jim will fill
in the rest eventually.

24:54.816 --> 24:57.984
He's showing you it was an
accident, right?

24:57.986 --> 25:01.021
I'm seeing that, yeah.

25:01.023 --> 25:04.358
I've been clean for what,
12 years now.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.828
Not even so much as a beer.

25:07.830 --> 25:13.766
But back then, man, I was
on some hard shit.

25:13.768 --> 25:17.204
And you needed money to get
more of it.

25:17.206 --> 25:22.909
Yeah, but this was just
a stop for gas.

25:22.911 --> 25:25.079
<i>I was passing
through nowhere Nevada...</i>

25:25.081 --> 25:29.617
<i>staying off the main highways,
and here's this gas station...</i>

25:29.619 --> 25:31.254
<i>only one guy working there.</i>

25:33.656 --> 25:35.388
<i>As I'm walking away...</i>

25:35.390 --> 25:40.263
<i>I get the idea that maybe
I'll knock the place over.</i>

25:42.732 --> 25:46.699
<i>As I'm building up the nerve,
the guy comes out...</i>

25:46.701 --> 25:48.401
<i>and I decide I'm just
gonna grab...</i>

25:48.403 --> 25:52.939
<i>what's in his wallet and split.</i>

25:52.941 --> 25:56.111
- <i>Dumb bastard had to fight back.</i>
- Whoa, whoa, all right, relax!

26:01.217 --> 26:03.783
<i>It was an accident...</i>

26:03.785 --> 26:07.157
<i>a total goddamn fluke.</i>

26:11.960 --> 26:13.793
<i>But of course I'm shitting
bricks now...</i>

26:13.795 --> 26:17.965
<i>so I get rid of his body
and get the hell out of there.</i>

26:17.967 --> 26:22.035
<i>I stay fucked up for
probably ten days straight.</i>

26:22.037 --> 26:24.103
<i>And when I come out of it...</i>

26:24.105 --> 26:27.140
<i>I figure the whole thing had
just been a bad dream.</i>

26:27.142 --> 26:28.609
<i>None of it happened.</i>

26:28.611 --> 26:30.444
<i>So if anybody
out there has seen my daddy...</i>

26:30.446 --> 26:32.111
<i>or knows where he is...</i>

26:32.113 --> 26:33.446
<i>But there she
was, man...</i>

26:33.448 --> 26:34.514
<i>...please say
something to the police.</i>

26:34.516 --> 26:36.719
<i>...on the fucking TV.</i>

26:36.986 --> 26:39.052
<i>I miss him and I'm scared.</i>

26:39.054 --> 26:40.454
<i>The victim was last seen...</i>

26:40.456 --> 26:42.089
<i>on the night of the 8th.</i>

26:42.091 --> 26:43.756
<i>Her face was on every screen...</i>

26:43.758 --> 26:47.396
<i>and every newspaper,
it was everywhere.</i>

26:49.265 --> 26:53.266
Wait, your... your Jim
is Jim Bishop?

26:53.268 --> 26:55.903
What do you know about that?
You were a kid.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.205
Stacy Bishop, dead mom,
missing dad?

26:59.207 --> 27:01.745
She was like America's orphan
sweetheart.

27:05.448 --> 27:07.915
I'm sorry, Nathan.

27:07.917 --> 27:11.888
You didn't deserve what happened
to you that night.

27:14.724 --> 27:17.057
But think about the opportunity
you're sitting on here.

27:17.059 --> 27:20.130
You have a chance to turn
everything around.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.800
It's good you found me.

28:16.351 --> 28:18.918
Nathan.

28:18.920 --> 28:21.355
What is it? Why are we stopped?

28:21.357 --> 28:23.322
I don't want to worry you...

28:23.324 --> 28:25.125
but I think we might have
a problem.

28:25.127 --> 28:26.994
- What?
- It's Jim.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.462
I lost my connection to him.

28:28.464 --> 28:30.563
Well, get him back.

28:30.565 --> 28:34.434
I have an idea, but you're not
going to like it.

28:34.436 --> 28:36.203
What?

28:36.205 --> 28:38.742
I need you to show me
where you put his body.

28:40.342 --> 28:42.042
No way.

28:42.044 --> 28:43.543
It's a tool in the medium world.

28:43.545 --> 28:45.978
I can connect more deeply
to a spirit...

28:45.980 --> 28:48.517
if I have access to its
final resting place.

28:51.253 --> 28:53.153
I don't know.

28:53.155 --> 28:55.155
Nathan, without a connection
to Jim...

28:55.157 --> 28:57.427
there's no talking to Stacy.

29:18.848 --> 29:20.950
Where are we?

29:41.903 --> 29:42.938
There.

29:50.379 --> 29:52.346
Are you sure?

29:52.348 --> 29:54.915
Yeah, I think so.

29:54.917 --> 29:57.618
Well, I need you to be sure.

29:57.620 --> 30:00.122
Yeah, that's it.

30:17.973 --> 30:19.406
All right, let's get
out of here.

30:49.071 --> 30:51.103
Most of Mike's old friends
have left town...

30:51.105 --> 30:53.240
but these folks are still
in the area.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.175
Oh, this is great, thank you.

30:55.177 --> 30:56.542
More tea?

30:56.544 --> 30:59.545
No, no, I should start making
these calls.

30:59.547 --> 31:02.249
I really appreciate your help.

31:02.251 --> 31:05.118
I'm curious about your
grandmother Cassy.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.353
How did she pass?

31:07.355 --> 31:09.188
Or is she just part
of the script?

31:09.190 --> 31:12.059
Sam, let's not go into this.

31:12.061 --> 31:14.494
Please... let me know
if he reaches out?

31:14.496 --> 31:16.495
I'm trying not to worry.

31:16.497 --> 31:18.965
Of course, without him, you
don't have much of a grift...

31:18.967 --> 31:20.634
do you?

31:20.636 --> 31:23.403
He's my best friend, I want
to make sure he's okay.

31:23.405 --> 31:25.038
And so do we...

31:25.040 --> 31:27.474
but this disappearing and
getting everybody...

31:27.476 --> 31:30.176
all riled up, well, it's just...

31:30.178 --> 31:34.246
I'm not trying to bad-mouth him,
but he's a willful boy.

31:34.248 --> 31:36.349
He always has been.

31:36.351 --> 31:39.386
When his father was in the
middle of a sermon once...

31:39.388 --> 31:43.090
Mike faked that the Holy Spirit
took him over.

31:43.092 --> 31:46.359
Now imagine a seven-year-old
dancing around a church...

31:46.361 --> 31:48.398
pretending to speak in tongues?

31:49.998 --> 31:52.698
It was very embarrassing for us.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.269
It sounds like he was just
trying to get your attention.

31:56.271 --> 31:58.441
Are you a parent?

31:59.574 --> 32:01.273
No.

32:01.275 --> 32:04.110
In a family of six, you can not
baby all your children.

32:04.112 --> 32:05.779
That is just the reality.

32:05.781 --> 32:09.315
And Mike always wanted more
than was possible to give him.

32:09.317 --> 32:13.086
You seem like a smart
and decent gal.

32:13.088 --> 32:15.321
Why not use those qualities
for something...

32:15.323 --> 32:20.260
that you can be proud of,
something honorable.

32:20.262 --> 32:22.596
You know, you and Michael aren't
as different as you think.

32:22.598 --> 32:24.398
How's that?

32:24.400 --> 32:27.266
You both comfort people with the
promise that this isn't it.

32:27.268 --> 32:29.202
That there's something big
and beautiful...

32:29.204 --> 32:30.704
at the end of the line.

32:30.706 --> 32:32.638
Miss, I will thank you not
to come into my house...

32:32.640 --> 32:35.809
and compare my ministry to that
con you're running with my son.

32:35.811 --> 32:37.676
I think it's time
we wrap this up.

32:37.678 --> 32:40.347
Unlike him, I believe
what I'm saying.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.648
I think it bothers you that
he's gonna reach more people...

32:42.650 --> 32:44.419
than you ever did.

32:47.589 --> 32:49.688
Let him have his fame.

32:49.690 --> 32:51.491
Like I've told him...

32:51.493 --> 32:54.697
it's better to be an honest
nobody than a crooked somebody.

32:58.266 --> 33:00.102
Well...

33:04.073 --> 33:07.240
I'll let you know if I hear
from your son.

33:07.242 --> 33:09.178
Yeah.

33:11.412 --> 33:13.649
I'll just walk her out.

33:19.287 --> 33:21.388
I don't like it either,
but we cannot be seen together.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.423
What... what if there's some
evidence out there...

33:23.425 --> 33:25.391
that links you back to Jim?

33:25.393 --> 33:27.494
I'm sure there's not, but why
would we take that chance...

33:27.496 --> 33:28.861
when we're this close
to the finish line?

33:28.863 --> 33:30.496
So what's your idea?

33:30.498 --> 33:32.666
You lay low here. I check
into a room in town.

33:32.668 --> 33:35.167
And then I'll reach out
to Stacy and do what I do.

33:35.169 --> 33:36.703
Why don't you just call her
from that phone?

33:36.705 --> 33:39.171
Except that, that call could be
traced back to this motel...

33:39.173 --> 33:40.639
which puts you in danger.

33:40.641 --> 33:43.545
No, I won't do that to you.

33:45.346 --> 33:46.879
What are you afraid of, Nathan?

33:46.881 --> 33:49.448
That I'm gonna walk out
of here and turn you in?

33:49.450 --> 33:51.251
You were asleep in the car.

33:51.253 --> 33:53.186
I could have driven you to the
nearest police station...

33:53.188 --> 33:56.555
and been done with you, right?

33:56.557 --> 33:58.257
I guess.

33:58.259 --> 34:00.426
I know you're not used
to trusting people...

34:00.428 --> 34:02.661
but you have to trust me.

34:02.663 --> 34:06.733
I can't do my job, if I'm
worried you're not safe.

34:06.735 --> 34:11.338
But it's your decision, okay?
You're the boss.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.809
We'll do what you decide.

34:17.378 --> 34:19.911
I-I mean, I suppose
you should go.

34:19.914 --> 34:22.748
I think it's the smart idea.

34:22.751 --> 34:27.620
Nathan, buddy, this is a
beautiful thing.

34:27.621 --> 34:30.226
The next time you see me,
this is all gonna be over.

34:33.327 --> 34:35.197
Hold on.

34:38.266 --> 34:39.502
Thank you.

34:41.869 --> 34:49.809
I'm uh... I'm really glad
that I didn't kill you.

34:49.811 --> 34:52.215
Um, me, too.

36:11.559 --> 36:13.395
Over there.

36:18.267 --> 36:20.966
Hi, Monica Lewis, Senior news
producer.

36:20.968 --> 36:23.269
Michael Vaughn, psychic medium.

36:23.271 --> 36:25.405
What can I do for you,
Mr. Vaughn?

36:25.407 --> 36:27.974
I'm in psychic communication
with a man who went missing...

36:27.976 --> 36:30.809
from this area back in '96,
Jim Bishop.

36:30.811 --> 36:33.812
That sounds fascinating
and I can't wait to hear more.

36:33.814 --> 36:36.383
Do you have a business card
I can use to contact you?

36:36.385 --> 36:38.550
I can lead you to his remains.

36:38.552 --> 36:40.352
Excuse me?

36:40.354 --> 36:43.823
Jim's spirit has directed me
to the location of his remains.

36:43.825 --> 36:45.524
Now if you think that sounds
newsworthy...

36:45.526 --> 36:47.693
I can lead you and your camera
crew to the spot.

36:47.695 --> 36:50.863
Is this something that you've
discussed with the police?

36:50.865 --> 36:53.600
The police would dismiss me
as a crackpot.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.602
Like you have.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.803
- I'm certainly not dismissing...
- It's fine.

36:57.805 --> 36:59.905
When you tell people you talk
to the dead for a living...

36:59.907 --> 37:02.841
you get used to that
raised-eyebrow look.

37:02.843 --> 37:07.079
Let me make it easy
for you, cover the story.

37:07.081 --> 37:09.416
If I'm full of shit, then you
can report on the wackjob...

37:09.418 --> 37:10.550
who's digging around the
mountains...

37:10.552 --> 37:12.084
for a body that isn't there.

37:12.086 --> 37:17.823
But if it is there,
and I know it is, well...

37:17.825 --> 37:20.862
seems like the kind of story
you'd wanna be on the scene for.

37:35.843 --> 37:37.711
- Hey, Stace?
- Yeah.

37:37.713 --> 37:39.579
You need to see this.

37:39.581 --> 37:41.780
<i>After nearly
two decades, search teams...</i>

37:41.782 --> 37:44.084
<i>are combing the West Mountains
searching for clues...</i>

37:44.086 --> 37:46.586
<i>in the Jim Bishop
disappearance case.</i>

37:46.588 --> 37:49.923
<i>But what makes this search so
unusual is that it's being...</i>

37:49.925 --> 37:52.791
<i>led by Michael Vaughn, a
psychic medium who claims...</i>

37:52.793 --> 37:56.528
<i>Mr. Bishop's spirit has been in
contact with him for days.</i>

37:56.530 --> 37:59.466
<i>He began sharing images with me
late Saturday night.</i>

37:59.468 --> 38:01.401
<i>And the more he revealed...</i>

38:01.403 --> 38:03.937
<i>the more it became clear to me
that Jim is ready to be found.</i>

38:03.939 --> 38:06.805
<i>I've been shown that he was
killed by a blow to the head.</i>

38:06.807 --> 38:10.008
<i>His attacker then brought him
here and disposed of the body.</i>

38:10.010 --> 38:12.111
<i>It's probably cold comfort at a
time like this...</i>

38:12.113 --> 38:14.747
<i>but Jim has assured me that his
death was sudden and painless.</i>

38:14.749 --> 38:16.649
<i>He experienced no suffering.</i>

38:16.651 --> 38:18.651
<i>Mr. Vaughn
managed to persuade a team...</i>

38:18.653 --> 38:20.419
<i>of forensic archaeologists
from the University...</i>

38:20.421 --> 38:22.055
<i>to help in the search.</i>

38:22.057 --> 38:24.023
<i>And while they have yet to turn
up anything substantial...</i>

38:24.025 --> 38:27.093
<i>the optimistic medium is not
giving up hope.</i>

38:27.095 --> 38:30.430
<i>A young, single father was
taken from his little girl...</i>

38:30.432 --> 38:33.499
<i>and this community,
years before his time.</i>

38:33.501 --> 38:35.135
<i>I just hope that the
information...</i>

38:35.137 --> 38:37.704
<i>I've been given can bring
a little peace...</i>

38:37.706 --> 38:40.006
<i>to everyone who loved
Jim Bishop.</i>

38:40.008 --> 38:42.142
<i>Live from West Lone Valley...</i>

38:42.144 --> 38:45.848
<i>I'm Lisa Reynolds, KLMB News,
Channel 6.</i>

38:48.483 --> 38:51.450
Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh,
breaking for dinner?

38:51.452 --> 38:53.486
It's gonna be getting dark soon,
we thought we'd call it a day.

38:53.488 --> 38:55.521
Okay, well, first thing
tomorrow morning...

38:55.523 --> 38:56.823
I'll bring the coffee and
the doughnuts.

38:56.825 --> 38:58.524
I can't, I have a class
to teach.

38:58.526 --> 39:00.160
The rest of you guys
are good, right?

39:00.162 --> 39:02.796
Michael, I'll be honest,
we just haven't seen anything...

39:02.798 --> 39:04.997
that suggests a gravesite.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.434
Jim's made it clear to me
that he's in this ground...

39:07.436 --> 39:09.803
and he's counting on you
to find him.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.939
And if you don't find him,
he may never be found.

39:12.941 --> 39:16.011
I don't think any of us
are ready to accept that.

39:17.512 --> 39:20.180
So go get some sleep, okay?

39:20.182 --> 39:21.814
Okay, you guys worked
your tails off today...

39:21.816 --> 39:23.716
Jim appreciates the effort.

39:23.718 --> 39:27.120
And I'll... I'll see you first
thing in the morning.

39:27.122 --> 39:29.222
I think that'll look
really good.

39:29.224 --> 39:31.524
Uh, what... what are you
shooting?

39:31.526 --> 39:34.660
I'm just getting footage for
tomorrow's follow-up story.

39:34.662 --> 39:37.129
The "wackjob digging in the
mountains" one.

39:37.131 --> 39:39.164
- He's up here.
- Good...

39:39.166 --> 39:41.800
because folks around here are
protective of Stacy Bishop...

39:41.802 --> 39:43.769
and if they feel like you're
jerking her around...

39:43.771 --> 39:46.708
you're gonna get a pretty
pissed-off town on your hands.

39:48.543 --> 39:50.579
All right, Ed, you're good,
let's pack it in.

40:06.260 --> 40:08.827
So you had to go
on the 5:00 o'clock news?

40:08.829 --> 40:11.497
Nathan, I don't want publicity
from this.

40:11.499 --> 40:14.867
All right, I'm just following
Jim's orders.

40:14.869 --> 40:17.537
Nathan, for this to work,
I have to know something.

40:17.539 --> 40:19.506
That spot that you showed me...

40:19.508 --> 40:21.006
is that where you put his body?

40:21.008 --> 40:22.742
It has to be.

40:22.744 --> 40:24.577
I mean, you felt him right
there, right?

40:24.579 --> 40:27.946
Yes, but there may have been
some other psychic factors...

40:27.948 --> 40:29.983
in play that I don't have time
to explain to you right now.

40:29.985 --> 40:31.517
It was 20 years ago...

40:31.519 --> 40:33.785
it was the middle of the night,
I was fucked up.

40:33.787 --> 40:38.460
As far as I can remember, yeah,
that's where I buried him.

40:39.827 --> 40:41.794
Why are there noodles
all on the wall?

40:41.796 --> 40:45.798
So now what? When are you
gonna see Stacy?

40:45.800 --> 40:47.867
I don't know, can't imagine
she's gonna want to talk...

40:47.869 --> 40:50.202
to me, if her father's body
hasn't turned up.

40:50.204 --> 40:52.941
Oh, great...

40:56.010 --> 40:59.546
I'm... I'm stuck in a place that
I never planned to come back to!

40:59.548 --> 41:00.979
All right, just calm down.

41:00.981 --> 41:02.981
So you're gonna do what
Jim sent us here for!

41:02.983 --> 41:06.586
Don't you think I'm trying
to do that?

41:06.588 --> 41:09.622
I'm so confused, I don't even
know any more!

41:14.095 --> 41:16.863
Just what in the hell
is going on in here?

41:16.865 --> 41:18.765
What the fuck is it to you,
lady?

41:18.767 --> 41:21.166
I will not be spoken to like
that on my property.

41:21.168 --> 41:22.635
Ma'am, he didn't mean that.

41:22.637 --> 41:24.236
I go to church with the
sheriff...

41:24.238 --> 41:26.271
and you can be sure that
he's gonna have someone...

41:26.273 --> 41:28.874
down here to deal with you.

41:28.876 --> 41:31.209
Fucking goddamn it!

41:31.211 --> 41:32.914
Be ready to run.

41:38.285 --> 41:40.320
I am so sorry, ma'am,
that was unacceptable.

41:40.322 --> 41:41.754
Don't slam my door.

41:41.756 --> 41:44.657
You guys already owe me
for a broken lamp.

41:44.659 --> 41:47.195
You know what, will this
cover it?

41:49.164 --> 41:51.064
The damn thing didn't cost $200.

41:51.066 --> 41:52.865
I know, but you deserve
something extra...

41:52.867 --> 41:55.204
for the um, inconvenience
we've caused tonight.

41:57.972 --> 42:01.274
I don't know what kind of flop
houses you're used to...

42:01.276 --> 42:03.276
but we have rules around here.

42:03.278 --> 42:05.278
Absolutely.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.946
Now there may be nicer places
down in town...

42:07.948 --> 42:10.216
but I have regular customers...

42:10.218 --> 42:13.186
who insist on staying here
because I run a tight ship.

42:13.188 --> 42:18.358
I do not put up with noise.
I do not put up with fighting.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.628
And I do not put up with
general foolishness.

42:21.630 --> 42:23.162
And you shouldn't.

42:23.164 --> 42:27.633
You work too hard to have guests
acting like hooligans.

42:27.635 --> 42:32.104
Wait, aren't you that psychic
from the news?

42:32.106 --> 42:35.173
Do you really think that
Jimmy's body is up there...

42:35.175 --> 42:37.075
on that mountain?

42:37.077 --> 42:38.910
I do.

42:38.912 --> 42:41.113
Unless he's trying to make
a fool out of me.

42:41.115 --> 42:43.783
Do you really talk to...?

42:43.785 --> 42:46.785
Those who have crossed over?
Yes, ma'am.

42:46.787 --> 42:49.021
But it's less of a conversation
and more like I'm shown...

42:49.023 --> 42:53.059
images, little snapshots
that I have to interpret.

42:53.061 --> 42:58.898
Like now, I'm seeing an older
gentleman.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.899
Someone who spent a lot
of time in this office.

43:00.901 --> 43:03.269
First name begins with a K
or a C?

43:03.271 --> 43:06.738
Ken was my husband.

43:06.740 --> 43:09.809
But he's been gone
for two years now.

43:09.811 --> 43:13.912
- You miss him, don't you?
- Oh, I do.

43:13.914 --> 43:15.847
Well, Ken doesn't miss you.

43:15.849 --> 43:19.084
Because to miss someone implies
that you're no longer with them.

43:19.086 --> 43:24.390
Ken doesn't need to miss you,
because Ken is always with you.

43:24.392 --> 43:27.827
I have felt that.

43:27.829 --> 43:29.162
What's your name?

43:29.164 --> 43:31.463
- Phyllis.
- May I take your hand, Phyllis?

43:31.465 --> 43:33.399
Yes.

43:33.401 --> 43:37.202
Ken is so proud of the work
you've done...

43:37.204 --> 43:38.937
keeping the motel running.

43:38.939 --> 43:40.807
And I'm not sure what
this means...

43:40.809 --> 43:43.879
but he says that you were right
about making that change.

43:45.979 --> 43:49.082
He always thought that it
was a waste of money...

43:49.084 --> 43:51.316
to re-carpet the rooms.

43:51.318 --> 43:54.120
It was the first thing I did
when he passed.

43:54.122 --> 43:56.358
Well, Ken loves the color
you chose.

43:59.327 --> 44:02.361
You know, I uh... I shouldn't
be saying this.

44:02.363 --> 44:06.932
That man in Room 3 is a client
of mine.

44:06.934 --> 44:09.434
I'm helping him through
a difficult loss.

44:09.436 --> 44:10.503
He's pretty fragile right now.

44:10.505 --> 44:12.338
Yeah.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.841
So I would just appreciate you
not mentioning anything...

44:14.843 --> 44:18.111
to anyone about my client
or the work I do with him.

44:18.113 --> 44:22.148
No, of course not, I won't
breathe a word.

44:22.150 --> 44:23.852
Thank you, Phyllis.

44:31.226 --> 44:33.024
Are we all right?

44:33.026 --> 44:34.963
Are we done acting crazy?

44:36.965 --> 44:38.396
Yeah.

44:38.398 --> 44:40.902
Then, yeah, we're all right.

44:53.414 --> 44:55.080
Hello.

44:55.082 --> 44:56.948
<i>Michael, it's Monica...</i>

44:56.950 --> 45:00.318
<i>holy shit, you're amazing,
they found him.</i>

45:00.320 --> 45:02.053
What?

45:02.055 --> 45:03.455
One of those nerds started
poking around 10 yards...

45:03.457 --> 45:05.490
to the south and they found
human remains.

45:05.492 --> 45:08.827
<i>What's left
of the clothes is identical...</i>

45:08.829 --> 45:10.363
<i>to what Jim was wearing.</i>

45:10.365 --> 45:12.465
<i>I'm so sorry I doubted you,
Michael.</i>

45:12.467 --> 45:14.432
Please don't apologize.

45:14.434 --> 45:17.472
What's important now is that
the healing can finally begin.

45:37.057 --> 45:39.925
Mr. Vaughn, any comment
on this morning's discovery?

45:39.927 --> 45:44.095
Well, I'm just very proud and
very humbled to have been...

45:44.097 --> 45:47.867
a small part in bringing some
closure to this terrible ordeal.

45:47.869 --> 45:49.269
Thanks for calling back.

45:49.271 --> 45:51.269
<i>Obviously I can
only take partial credit.</i>

45:51.271 --> 45:54.207
So, Michael hasn't reached
out to you?

45:54.209 --> 45:57.910
Uh-huh. Okay, well,
if you do hear from him...

45:57.912 --> 45:59.879
would you just get him to call
me on this number?

45:59.881 --> 46:03.082
<i>Jim Bishop, who broke his
silence and led me here.</i>

46:03.084 --> 46:05.417
<i>And have you had any contact
with Jim's daughter, Stacy?</i>

46:05.419 --> 46:08.486
<i>Unfortunately, I have
not yet met with Miss Bishop...</i>

46:08.488 --> 46:11.256
<i>but I do know a reunion
with her father...</i>

46:11.258 --> 46:12.858
<i>would mean a great deal to him.</i>

46:12.860 --> 46:14.894
<i>Has Mr. Bishop shown you
anything...</i>

46:14.896 --> 46:16.863
<i>to help identify his killer?</i>

46:16.865 --> 46:20.365
<i>I don't have a clear picture of
his identity, but I do know...</i>

46:20.367 --> 46:22.401
<i>that the man responsible
is no longer with us.</i>

46:22.403 --> 46:24.870
<i>I've been shown that he took
his own life...</i>

46:24.872 --> 46:26.407
<i>not long after Jim's death.</i>

46:50.365 --> 46:52.465
Michael Vaughn?

46:52.467 --> 46:54.633
Detective Bill Banning.

46:54.635 --> 46:56.936
I hate to bug a guy who's
in the middle of his dinner...

46:56.938 --> 46:58.970
but I just needed to come over
here and thank you personally...

46:58.972 --> 47:02.240
for everything you did to help
crack this Bishop case.

47:02.242 --> 47:04.376
Happy to be of service,
Detective.

47:04.378 --> 47:06.379
Can I introduce you to my
partner? Just take a second.

47:06.381 --> 47:07.579
- Zim!
- Yeah.

47:07.581 --> 47:09.584
- Zim!
- Coming.

47:11.052 --> 47:13.218
Michael Vaughn.

47:13.220 --> 47:14.586
- The uh... the guy?
- Yeah!

47:14.588 --> 47:16.354
- This is Detective Ron Zimmer.
- Wow.

47:16.356 --> 47:19.425
Now Zim, who was first assigned
to the Bishop disappearance...

47:19.427 --> 47:21.227
way back in the day,
when it first broke.

47:21.229 --> 47:23.195
Yeah, I could have used you
in '96. Where the hell were you?

47:23.197 --> 47:27.033
Well, in '96, I was 14, soI was
probably pretty busy...

47:27.035 --> 47:28.437
failing to lose my virginity.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.377
- Wow.
- Have a seat.

47:36.677 --> 47:39.245
Well... to finding Jim.

47:39.247 --> 47:42.013
To finding Jim.

47:42.015 --> 47:43.448
And finding Michael.

47:43.450 --> 47:44.950
We're closing cases
left and right.

47:44.952 --> 47:46.255
Are we now?

47:48.423 --> 47:52.057
You didn't hear?
You're a missing person, pal.

47:52.059 --> 47:54.093
They filed a report on you
back in Albuquerque...

47:54.095 --> 47:55.494
on Sunday, I think it was.

47:55.496 --> 47:57.997
Yeah, it was filed
by Miss Mills, I believe.

47:57.999 --> 47:59.597
Chelsea.

47:59.599 --> 48:02.667
Chelsea Mills, that's right.

48:02.669 --> 48:05.104
Just because a guy leaves town
without saying goodbye...

48:05.106 --> 48:06.671
doesn't mean he's gone missing.

48:06.673 --> 48:09.075
Christ, let's hope not.

48:09.077 --> 48:10.742
I was in a pretty big hurry.

48:10.744 --> 48:13.012
When you have a spirit like Jim
who has a job...

48:13.014 --> 48:15.316
they want you to do, they want
you to do it now.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.653
How you liking Lone Valley?

48:20.655 --> 48:23.421
I'm loving it. Folks here
couldn't be more welcoming.

48:23.423 --> 48:26.191
They're a good breed,
aren't they? Ah...

48:26.193 --> 48:29.495
Nice people.

48:29.497 --> 48:31.497
So you must have rolled
into town Monday...

48:31.499 --> 48:33.399
I would imagine, right?

48:33.401 --> 48:35.700
Bright and early, saw the sun
coming up over the mountains.

48:35.702 --> 48:39.338
Beautiful drive, yeah.

48:39.340 --> 48:41.340
When the kids were little, we
used to make that drive...

48:41.342 --> 48:43.642
- down to Santa Fe every year.
- Mm.

48:43.644 --> 48:47.146
Beautiful, yeah, it was like 18,
19 hours straight...

48:47.148 --> 48:49.115
if you go straight through.

48:49.117 --> 48:52.151
'Course, I had the wife with me,
so we'd... we'd switch off.

48:52.153 --> 48:53.753
You did that whole drive alone?

48:53.755 --> 48:58.024
Yeah... well, not entirely by
myself. I had Jim with me.

48:58.026 --> 49:00.626
You know, in my line of work,
you're never really by yourself.

49:00.628 --> 49:03.495
- So...
- Wow, I can't imagine.

49:03.497 --> 49:05.166
It's amazing.

49:08.168 --> 49:10.436
We should let you finish
your steak.

49:10.438 --> 49:12.070
Thank you for stopping by.

49:12.072 --> 49:13.705
It's a pleasure meeting
the guys who do the real work.

49:13.707 --> 49:16.274
Likewise, and in terms
of this whole Jim thing...

49:16.276 --> 49:18.276
obviously your discovery's
opened up a murder...

49:18.278 --> 49:20.245
investigation, so we're gonna
need you to stay in town...

49:20.247 --> 49:22.580
for a couple days in case we
have to tap that insight.

49:22.582 --> 49:24.582
Absolutely.

49:24.584 --> 49:27.787
Although, as I've said, the...
the murderer is, or was...

49:27.789 --> 49:29.821
he's not alive.

49:29.823 --> 49:32.591
Yeah, we get that, but doing
the real work...

49:32.593 --> 49:35.260
means exhausting all
possibility.

49:35.262 --> 49:38.463
Understood.

49:38.465 --> 49:41.633
By the way, you're okay,
aren't you, you feel okay?

49:41.635 --> 49:43.269
I'm great.

49:43.271 --> 49:45.537
You sure? Because the report
in Albuquerque...

49:45.539 --> 49:48.340
said there were traces of blood
found near your phone.

49:48.342 --> 49:53.144
Oh, you know what? I had a few
drinks that night.

49:53.146 --> 49:56.448
I took a tumble in the parking
lot, it wasn't my finest moment.

49:56.450 --> 49:58.653
That's like a Tuesday for Zim.

50:02.722 --> 50:04.590
Good to meet you.

50:04.592 --> 50:06.595
Likewise.

50:08.796 --> 50:10.332
That's the guy.

50:44.465 --> 50:46.168
Nathan.

50:47.869 --> 50:50.072
Nathan, it's Michael.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.250
Nathan? There you are.

51:03.918 --> 51:05.684
Turn it off.

51:05.686 --> 51:08.356
- What are you doing?
- Turn it off!

51:12.492 --> 51:15.294
Everything okay in here?

51:15.296 --> 51:17.829
You should hear these fucking
vultures.

51:17.831 --> 51:21.300
He's nothing but a piece
of goddamn meat to them.

51:21.302 --> 51:24.370
I know, it's disgusting.

51:24.372 --> 51:26.671
But... but I have some good news.

51:26.673 --> 51:28.841
I'm gonna get you out
of here tonight.

51:28.843 --> 51:31.477
So it's done?

51:31.479 --> 51:34.847
It's... it's going to be done.

51:34.849 --> 51:37.883
In the meantime, there's
a 9:30 bus...

51:37.885 --> 51:40.285
leaving the Greyhound terminal
tonight, okay?

51:40.287 --> 51:44.622
Take this, go home, I will come
to you when this is all over.

51:44.624 --> 51:47.425
I'm not leaving until
the job's done.

51:47.427 --> 51:49.628
Nathan, there are cops
all over me.

51:49.630 --> 51:52.400
That means that you're not safe.
You need to leave.

51:55.769 --> 52:00.238
Before you came, I imagined
going outside and sitting...

52:00.240 --> 52:04.776
with those pricks, and telling
'em everything...

52:04.778 --> 52:07.849
the whole story.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.584
Can you imagine the look
on their faces.

52:11.586 --> 52:12.818
I don't... uh, that...

52:12.820 --> 52:15.222
Jim would not want you
to do that.

52:19.727 --> 52:24.662
Does he know how... how tired
I am...

52:24.664 --> 52:31.539
all these years of hiding
and looking over my shoulder?

52:32.939 --> 52:35.543
Nathan, are we friends?

52:36.711 --> 52:38.544
Yeah.

52:38.546 --> 52:41.946
How would you like to see me,
your friend, go to prison?

52:41.948 --> 52:44.783
That's what would happen if you
did something like that.

52:44.785 --> 52:46.751
I'd be considered an accessory
to murder.

52:46.753 --> 52:48.923
Is that what you want?

52:51.925 --> 52:55.729
I just want you to hurry up
and talk to her already.

53:02.936 --> 53:04.702
Mr. Vaughn, can we talk to you?

53:04.704 --> 53:06.972
- It's not a good time.
- Please! We need your help.

53:06.974 --> 53:08.506
What do you do for a living,
lady?

53:08.508 --> 53:09.374
I'm a waitress.

53:09.376 --> 53:10.341
What if I came up to you
on the street...

53:10.343 --> 53:12.577
and I demanded that you
serve me an omelet?

53:12.579 --> 53:15.046
Be a little rude, wouldn't it?
I'm off the clock.

53:15.048 --> 53:20.318
Our son was kidnapped, we just
need to know if he's alive.

53:20.320 --> 53:23.321
We came all the way up here
from Florida to see you.

53:23.323 --> 53:27.693
Please, just a few
minutes of your time.

53:27.695 --> 53:29.528
Arturo was taken
from his preschool...

53:29.530 --> 53:32.597
almost a year ago and the police
can't tell us anything.

53:32.599 --> 53:34.767
We drove up here hoping that you
could... I don't know...

53:34.769 --> 53:38.939
We need to know if you feel
any connection to him.

53:46.579 --> 53:49.414
I'm uh, not getting anything
from Arturo.

53:49.416 --> 53:53.587
So... he's still alive?

53:56.023 --> 53:58.827
It could mean a number
of things...

54:02.662 --> 54:07.434
but yeah, I think he's
still alive.

54:09.003 --> 54:12.838
Thank you, oh...

54:12.840 --> 54:14.575
may God bless you.

54:20.081 --> 54:22.113
So how does this end?

54:22.115 --> 54:24.082
It ends when I give a reading
to Stacy Bishop.

54:24.084 --> 54:27.019
And this Nathan will just go
off on his merry way?

54:27.021 --> 54:29.490
Yes.

54:33.126 --> 54:38.497
He's dumb and desperate to
believe. Trust me, he's hooked.

54:38.499 --> 54:40.698
One issue is that he's
a little restless.

54:40.700 --> 54:43.001
I could use another set of eyes,
just to let me know...

54:43.003 --> 54:45.070
if he goes anywhere or does
anything erratic.

54:45.072 --> 54:47.740
Oh, you need my help?

54:47.742 --> 54:50.108
I always need your help,
we're partners.

54:50.110 --> 54:51.876
Chelsea and Michael.

54:51.878 --> 54:54.481
I had to watch CNN to find out
where you were.

54:55.648 --> 54:57.615
I know, sorry about that.

54:57.617 --> 54:59.417
You didn't call me,
because you knew...

54:59.419 --> 55:00.885
I'd try to talk you
out of this.

55:00.887 --> 55:02.588
Yeah.

55:02.590 --> 55:05.657
The rule is we don't make
any big decisions...

55:05.659 --> 55:07.859
without consulting each other.

55:07.861 --> 55:13.131
You broke that rule and now you
need me to shadow a murderer.

55:13.133 --> 55:16.033
To be fair, we're not talking
about the Zodiac Killer here.

55:16.035 --> 55:18.537
Talking about a guy who,
20 years ago, tried to mug...

55:18.539 --> 55:20.405
someone and accidentally broke
his neck.

55:20.407 --> 55:23.608
And he taped you to a chair
and almost cut your throat.

55:23.610 --> 55:26.144
It was a lot less dramatic
than it sounds.

55:26.146 --> 55:29.148
Michael, we were doing
just fine without this.

55:29.150 --> 55:33.184
Watching you eat alone in shitty
hotel bars every night...

55:33.186 --> 55:38.557
is not my idea of just fine,
you deserve better than that.

55:38.559 --> 55:42.428
We deserve better than that.

55:42.430 --> 55:45.597
I mean, my phone is full of TV
and book offers.

55:45.599 --> 55:47.698
We've earned those!

55:47.700 --> 55:51.405
Michael, none of that matters,
if you end up in jail or dead.

55:56.110 --> 55:58.744
I can't look at those feet
anymore.

55:58.746 --> 56:04.485
Just wait, please! I fucked up.
I fucked up.

56:06.921 --> 56:08.553
I'm sorry.

56:08.555 --> 56:12.691
You are the best person I know,
and I let you down...

56:12.693 --> 56:18.030
but if you just stay, I swear
I will never make...

56:18.032 --> 56:19.898
another move without your
approval.

56:19.900 --> 56:24.838
Just please don't go...
I need you.

56:30.977 --> 56:33.945
I visited your parents.

56:33.947 --> 56:35.580
Why?

56:35.582 --> 56:37.785
Because I was looking for you.

56:39.887 --> 56:41.523
Did they seem worried?

56:51.599 --> 56:53.901
I'm glad you're okay.

57:46.186 --> 57:47.818
Hi, you must be Ben.

57:47.820 --> 57:51.925
I am, hi. I'm sorry, you are?

57:54.827 --> 57:57.229
Michael Vaughn, the psychic
medium who's been talking...

57:57.231 --> 58:01.233
It was a joke, I know who
you are. Nice to meet you.

58:01.235 --> 58:05.637
Okay, um, I'm sorry to just drop
by like this, but...

58:05.639 --> 58:08.307
You know, can we talk inside?
The cameras are...

58:08.309 --> 58:11.075
We're gettin' used to them.

58:11.077 --> 58:14.245
Okay, well, I'm actually here
to speak with Stacy.

58:14.247 --> 58:15.347
Is she available?

58:15.349 --> 58:18.983
Uh... now's not a great time.

58:18.985 --> 58:23.854
Is there a better time?
Maybe later today, this evening.

58:23.856 --> 58:25.856
It's been a tough week, Michael.

58:25.858 --> 58:29.327
She's not really ready to talk
to anyone just yet.

58:29.329 --> 58:31.129
Understood.

58:31.131 --> 58:33.231
It's just that her dad
is very excited...

58:33.233 --> 58:34.800
to talk to his little girl
again.

58:34.802 --> 58:37.769
And in my experience, a reunion
like that...

58:37.771 --> 58:39.037
can provide some real comfort.

58:39.039 --> 58:40.606
I'll tell her.

58:40.608 --> 58:42.707
- Good... all right.
- Okay.

58:42.709 --> 58:44.108
Well, uh, this is my card.

58:44.110 --> 58:46.878
Just give me a call
when she's ready.

58:46.880 --> 58:49.013
Uh, sooner than later,
hopefully.

58:49.015 --> 58:52.718
As I said, her dad is just very
excited to talk to her.

58:52.720 --> 58:57.856
Oh, and these are for her.
Those are from me.

58:57.858 --> 58:59.825
Gosh, that's really thoughtful.

58:59.827 --> 59:03.394
Thanks for stopping by.
Take care.

59:03.396 --> 59:05.030
- You... you got it.
- Yeah, I got it, thanks.

59:05.032 --> 59:06.267
- There you go.
- Thanks.

59:08.668 --> 59:09.801
We're outside Stacy Bishop's
house...

59:09.803 --> 59:12.037
<i>where Michael Vaughn arrived
moments ago.</i>

59:12.039 --> 59:13.338
<i>What's being discussed in the
house, we're not quite...</i>

59:13.340 --> 59:14.342
<i>He's here!</i>

59:16.343 --> 59:17.943
<i>Excuse me, what brings you
here, Mr. Vaughn?</i>

59:17.945 --> 59:19.845
<i>Are you and Stacy planning
to talk?</i>

59:19.847 --> 59:21.345
<i>Do you have any reaction
to the coroner's report?</i>

59:21.347 --> 59:22.680
- <i>What's that?</i>
- <i>The coroner's report...</i>

59:22.682 --> 59:24.950
- <i>do you have any comment?</i>
- <i>I'm sorry, I haven't read it.</i>

59:24.952 --> 59:26.818
It was just released...

59:26.820 --> 59:28.687
<i>it says the likely cause
of Mr. Bishop's death...</i>

59:28.689 --> 59:30.789
<i>was not a blow to the head, but
rather multiple stab wounds.</i>

59:30.791 --> 59:33.425
<i>Do you have any comment?</i>

59:33.427 --> 59:35.292
<i>Um, as I've said...</i>

59:35.294 --> 59:37.428
<i>I can only interpret images
that are shown to me...</i>

59:37.430 --> 59:40.131
<i>so, sometimes there are going
to be some inaccuracies...</i>

59:40.133 --> 59:42.133
<i>maybe some facts left out
for unknown reasons...</i>

59:42.135 --> 59:44.736
<i>but the important thing is that
Jim Bishop gave me...</i>

59:44.738 --> 59:47.204
<i>the necessary information
to help uncover his body.</i>

59:47.206 --> 59:49.140
<i>So, if you'll excuse me.</i>

59:49.142 --> 59:50.975
<i>That was
Michael Vaughn responding...</i>

59:50.977 --> 59:53.014
<i>to the latest development
in the Jim Bishop case.</i>

01:00:01.954 --> 01:00:04.021
That son of a bitch
is gonna ruin everything.

01:00:04.023 --> 01:00:05.823
<i>Then let's get ahead of it.</i>

01:00:05.825 --> 01:00:07.858
Go to the police,
tell them about Nathan.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.262
Tell them you felt your life was
in danger, so you kept lying.

01:00:11.264 --> 01:00:13.465
<i>No, there are
still moves to make here.</i>

01:00:13.467 --> 01:00:14.932
<i>I just have to finish this...</i>

01:00:14.934 --> 01:00:16.267
before Dipshit ruins my
credibility.

01:00:16.269 --> 01:00:18.003
<i>How?</i>

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.771
Jim's memorial is tomorrow.

01:00:19.773 --> 01:00:21.807
Stacy will be there,
I'll make her talk to me...

01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:23.207
and then we are out.

01:00:23.209 --> 01:00:25.910
I'm scared to be here, Michael.

01:00:25.912 --> 01:00:27.079
<i>You're fine...</i>

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:29.146
<i>just keep your doors locked.</i>

01:00:29.148 --> 01:00:33.251
Unless you'd feel better staying
with me tonight.

01:00:33.253 --> 01:00:36.454
I'm being serious.

01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:39.990
Can we just stick to the
conversation?

01:00:39.992 --> 01:00:42.963
And how are you gonna make her
talk, Michael?

01:00:57.443 --> 01:01:00.378
Thank you so much
for coming out today.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.347
I guess these things usually
happen in a church...

01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:08.452
but anybody who knew my dad,
knows that this was his church.

01:01:08.454 --> 01:01:12.490
He loved painting this place.

01:01:12.492 --> 01:01:15.526
In fact, the first time I picked
up a paint brush was here.

01:01:15.528 --> 01:01:20.097
He held me up to his canvas
and let me ruin...

01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:23.100
one of his landscapes,
by painting a giant...

01:01:23.102 --> 01:01:26.441
yellow, smiling sun
in the corner of it.

01:01:29.142 --> 01:01:33.345
My dad is gone, we know
that now.

01:01:33.347 --> 01:01:40.885
But somehow I managed to gain
countless dads and moms...

01:01:40.887 --> 01:01:44.356
and brothers and sisters,
because of it.

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:46.791
You guys are all my family...

01:01:46.793 --> 01:01:50.831
and I'm just so grateful,
so, thank you.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:25.062
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:31.202
Shit.

01:02:58.631 --> 01:03:00.465
Michael...

01:03:00.467 --> 01:03:03.602
I want you to tell me
what the fuck is going on.

01:03:03.604 --> 01:03:05.604
I'm sorry, sir, do we know
each other?

01:03:05.606 --> 01:03:08.305
There you go, fucking with me
again!

01:03:08.307 --> 01:03:09.608
You seem distraught.

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:11.609
- Is everything okay?
- Who is she?

01:03:11.611 --> 01:03:13.912
Who is that woman that's
watching me at the motel?

01:03:13.914 --> 01:03:15.312
I don't know who you're
talking about...

01:03:15.314 --> 01:03:16.981
but it seems like maybe
you've had a few drinks.

01:03:16.983 --> 01:03:18.249
Fuck you.

01:03:18.251 --> 01:03:20.352
Excuse me, there are children
here.

01:03:20.354 --> 01:03:22.486
Okay, maybe we should go find
a nice, quiet place to talk...

01:03:22.488 --> 01:03:24.388
just you and me, okay?

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:28.526
Look at Stacy right now.
You're upsetting her.

01:03:28.528 --> 01:03:31.363
And Jim is furious with you
for it.

01:03:31.365 --> 01:03:34.265
Let's go. Let's go!

01:03:34.267 --> 01:03:37.903
Sorry, it's... it's an emotional
day for everyone.

01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:44.175
Where are we going?

01:03:44.177 --> 01:03:45.943
Jim wants me to take you home.

01:03:45.945 --> 01:03:48.114
Unh-unh, we're not done.

01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:51.249
Please don't raise your voice.

01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:54.255
It's scary enough being alone
with you as it is.

01:03:57.624 --> 01:04:02.026
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you.

01:04:02.028 --> 01:04:04.064
The truth about Jim's
little accident?

01:04:06.465 --> 01:04:10.904
Yeah, didn't exactly help me
to earn Stacy's trust, did it?

01:04:13.072 --> 01:04:16.573
I've been completely truthful
with you from the beginning.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:19.880
I just assumed you were being
the same with me.

01:04:21.981 --> 01:04:25.316
It's not just the lies, it's the
fact that you're drinking again.

01:04:25.318 --> 01:04:29.023
Paranoid that some woman
is watching you.

01:04:32.425 --> 01:04:37.963
You said he was furious at me.
Is that true?

01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:40.097
Yes.

01:04:40.099 --> 01:04:43.303
I always thought they couldn't
feel those kind of emotions.

01:04:45.305 --> 01:04:47.942
Why don't we just have a little
quiet time, please?

01:04:48.675 --> 01:04:50.010
Yeah.

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:58.716
Afternoon.

01:04:58.718 --> 01:05:01.086
Oh, sorry, guys, my rooms are
all booked up.

01:05:01.088 --> 01:05:03.521
Oh, we're not looking
for a room today.

01:05:03.523 --> 01:05:06.323
I'm Detective Banning,
this is Detective Zimmer.

01:05:06.325 --> 01:05:10.061
We were hoping you could take
a look at a picture for us.

01:05:10.063 --> 01:05:12.363
I suppose so.

01:05:12.365 --> 01:05:14.099
Good.

01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:18.204
Well, this guy right here
with uh, Michael Vaughn...

01:05:19.673 --> 01:05:22.610
wondering if you recognize him.

01:05:24.077 --> 01:05:27.281
- Hm...
- Has he been through here?

01:05:30.784 --> 01:05:33.218
Yeah.

01:05:49.235 --> 01:05:50.670
Can you hurry up?

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:05.318
Christ, look at that sky.

01:06:07.086 --> 01:06:10.254
I get some great skies
in the desert...

01:06:10.256 --> 01:06:12.459
but nothing like these
mountain sunsets.

01:06:17.363 --> 01:06:20.266
Take a look... before it's gone.

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:58.135
Chels.

01:06:58.137 --> 01:06:59.437
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:06:59.439 --> 01:07:00.738
I'm about three hours out
of town.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.106
<i>Is he with you?</i>

01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:03.408
Yeah, we're out.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:04.475
<i>Thank god.</i>

01:07:04.477 --> 01:07:05.776
<i>Have you been getting calls?</i>

01:07:05.778 --> 01:07:06.945
Yeah, but I've been ignoring
them.

01:07:06.947 --> 01:07:08.546
<i>Good. Keep doing that.</i>

01:07:08.548 --> 01:07:10.381
Why?

01:07:10.383 --> 01:07:11.582
<i>Stacy's people released...</i>

01:07:11.584 --> 01:07:13.318
<i>a statement to the media.</i>

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.653
They're interested in doing
a sit-down with you.

01:07:15.655 --> 01:07:17.521
<i>Well, it's
too late. She had her chance.</i>

01:07:17.523 --> 01:07:20.457
Exactly, a live reading
would be crazy.

01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:22.459
A live reading, like on camera?

01:07:22.461 --> 01:07:23.727
<i>Does it matter?</i>

01:07:23.729 --> 01:07:25.729
Why would she do that?

01:07:25.731 --> 01:07:27.564
<i>I don't
know, somebody probably...</i>

01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:29.033
<i>offered her big bucks,
but you're not doing it.</i>

01:07:29.035 --> 01:07:31.236
<i>So, I guess
the decision's been made then.</i>

01:07:31.238 --> 01:07:32.604
There's nothing to decide.

01:07:32.606 --> 01:07:34.305
Something like that's
never been done.

01:07:34.307 --> 01:07:36.707
Which is a pretty compelling
reason to consider it.

01:07:36.709 --> 01:07:37.908
<i>It hasn't been done...</i>

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.611
<i>because it can't be controlled.</i>

01:07:39.613 --> 01:07:41.412
If you sink, I won't be there
to pull you out.

01:07:41.414 --> 01:07:42.814
<i>But if I don't sink?</i>

01:07:42.816 --> 01:07:43.914
No.

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.749
It could be legendary.

01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:47.519
<i>Michael, I'm begging you.</i>

01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:49.187
<i>For the sake of everything
we've built...</i>

01:07:49.189 --> 01:07:51.189
<i>please just keep driving.</i>

01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:53.191
Stop being dramatic,
we're just talking.

01:07:53.193 --> 01:07:54.591
I-I gotta go.

01:07:54.593 --> 01:07:56.262
Michael, please, don't come
back here!

01:08:04.303 --> 01:08:06.738
It's gone.

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:11.345
If Jim gave you one more chance,
could he trust you?

01:08:21.687 --> 01:08:23.220
Michael?

01:08:23.223 --> 01:08:25.856
Phyllis... hi.

01:08:25.858 --> 01:08:29.694
You know, all my rooms come
with doors, right?

01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:32.497
I take client confidentiality
very seriously.

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:35.332
I've been waiting for you
to stop by again.

01:08:35.335 --> 01:08:38.203
It would be so nice to hear
from Ken.

01:08:38.205 --> 01:08:41.537
I thought of a few things
I'd like to ask him.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.207
Good, good, good.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.443
When I have a moment, I promise
I'll come find you.

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:48.578
You know, a couple of detectives
came by earlier.

01:08:48.581 --> 01:08:52.515
They showed me a picture
of you and...

01:08:52.518 --> 01:08:55.255
And they wanted to know
if I recognized him.

01:08:56.622 --> 01:08:57.955
What did you tell them?

01:08:57.957 --> 01:09:00.725
That I'd never seen him
before in my life.

01:09:00.727 --> 01:09:03.528
Okay, you did good,
thank you.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:07.798
Of course, I don't feel so hot
lying to them like that.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.667
You didn't lie to them.

01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:11.636
You protected some information
to help a person in pain.

01:09:11.638 --> 01:09:13.002
There's no crime in that.

01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:18.008
I know, but it's got me
all tied up in knots.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.810
Although...

01:09:19.812 --> 01:09:21.444
What?

01:09:21.447 --> 01:09:24.916
Talking with Ken always seemed
to have a way...

01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:27.321
of calming me down.

01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:34.527
Well, then maybe we should see
if Ken is available.

01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:19.636
Stacy, we found this in your
bedroom...

01:10:19.638 --> 01:10:22.073
and I'd love for it in the
background of your shot.

01:10:22.075 --> 01:10:24.542
You're fine with that, right?

01:10:24.544 --> 01:10:28.312
- Yeah... yeah, sure.
- Great.

01:10:28.314 --> 01:10:29.946
<i>We're counting down the hours...</i>

01:10:29.948 --> 01:10:33.351
<i>until tonight's Inside America,
when Stacy Bishop...</i>

01:10:33.353 --> 01:10:35.619
<i>and Michael Vaughn meet
for the live conversation...</i>

01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:37.689
<i>we've all been waiting for.</i>

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:39.791
<i>It's
being called Vaughn-demonium.</i>

01:10:39.793 --> 01:10:42.459
<i>The usual sleepy town
of Lone Valley, Nevada...</i>

01:10:42.461 --> 01:10:45.896
<i>is buzzing with anticipation
over tonight's live TV event.</i>

01:10:45.898 --> 01:10:47.832
<i>Stacy
Bishop and Michael Vaughn...</i>

01:10:47.834 --> 01:10:49.867
<i>will be sitting down
for their first ever...</i>

01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:51.601
<i>face-to-face discussion...</i>

01:10:51.603 --> 01:10:55.373
<i>on a special, live edition
of Inside America.</i>

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:56.708
<i>People can't wait to see...</i>

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.676
<i>Stacy reconnect with her
father.</i>

01:10:58.678 --> 01:11:00.944
There's a lot
of speculation and hope...

01:11:00.946 --> 01:11:02.547
<i>about what will be revealed
tonight.</i>

01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:04.481
<i>You know, I have to tell you...</i>

01:11:04.483 --> 01:11:06.617
<i>this Michael Vaughn, he comes
out of basic obscurity...</i>

01:11:06.619 --> 01:11:08.852
<i>and all of a sudden all the
lights are on this gentleman.</i>

01:11:08.854 --> 01:11:10.687
<i>What's your take on what's
gonna happen?</i>

01:11:10.689 --> 01:11:12.489
<i>We're all anticipating that...</i>

01:11:12.491 --> 01:11:15.025
<i>Michael Vaughn and Stacy Bishop
will have a sit-down...</i>

01:11:15.027 --> 01:11:17.662
<i>and hopefully it will give
Stacy...</i>

01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:18.762
<i>Social media reaction...</i>

01:11:18.764 --> 01:11:20.097
<i>has been overwhelming.</i>

01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:25.936
<i>Obviously the big question...</i>

01:11:25.938 --> 01:11:27.739
<i>that still remains is...</i>

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:30.344
<i>who was responsible for her
father's death.</i>

01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.445
Mr. Vaughn, I'm Ron Cassidy...

01:11:35.447 --> 01:11:36.713
I'll be producing your segment
tonight.

01:11:36.715 --> 01:11:38.850
- Great.
- Come on in, get you set up.

01:12:00.572 --> 01:12:04.378
All right, everyone, we're live
in ten seconds, all right.

01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:11.017
And five, four, three...

01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:15.919
Hello and welcome to this...

01:12:15.921 --> 01:12:17.821
very special edition
of Inside America.

01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:19.791
I'm Pauline Williams.

01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:22.526
<i>We're coming to you live
from Lone Valley, Nevada...</i>

01:12:22.528 --> 01:12:24.861
<i>and the home of Stacy Bishop.</i>

01:12:24.863 --> 01:12:28.065
<i>I know that this has been a
very emotional week for you...</i>

01:12:28.067 --> 01:12:31.202
<i>so thank you for inviting us
here tonight.</i>

01:12:31.204 --> 01:12:34.672
<i>We're also joined by Michael
Vaughn, the psychic medium...</i>

01:12:34.674 --> 01:12:36.541
<i>who helped police uncover
the remains...</i>

01:12:36.543 --> 01:12:39.075
<i>of Stacy's missing father,
Jim Bishop.</i>

01:12:39.077 --> 01:12:40.778
<i>Thank you, Pauline.</i>

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.547
<i>I'll start with a very obvious
question...</i>

01:12:43.549 --> 01:12:46.984
<i>is Jim here with Stacy
right now?</i>

01:12:46.986 --> 01:12:50.488
<i>A better question might be
when is he not with her?</i>

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:53.724
<i>I'm asked all the time whether
people's loved ones...</i>

01:12:53.726 --> 01:12:56.828
<i>are physically present,
and I always say...</i>

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.762
<i>that it's like a sunset,
you know?</i>

01:12:58.764 --> 01:13:01.666
<i>Try to remember the most
beautiful sunset you ever saw.</i>

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:03.601
Hey, man, you gotta see this.

01:13:03.603 --> 01:13:05.069
<i>Except that it was gone.</i>

01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:08.038
It's from the old gas station
footage.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.708
We couldn't I.D. this guy
back in '96.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:12.577
He stops in about three hours
before Bishop

01:13:12.579 --> 01:13:15.111
disappears from the tape, right?

01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:17.017
Look at this.

01:13:18.884 --> 01:13:21.053
- Hm?
- That's our guy.

01:13:22.754 --> 01:13:24.187
That's our guy!

01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:26.056
Let's go get him.

01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:30.261
<i>Your father's body, that
disposable shell, that is gone.</i>

01:13:30.263 --> 01:13:34.765
But his spirit, your actual
father...

01:13:34.767 --> 01:13:37.235
that's always with you.

01:13:37.237 --> 01:13:40.770
He's... he's actually showing
me something.

01:13:40.772 --> 01:13:43.207
I'm seeing a time that
you got hurt...

01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:47.043
maybe you broke a bone,
ten, eleven years old?

01:13:47.045 --> 01:13:50.181
I broke my ankle at a softball
game when I was eleven.

01:13:50.183 --> 01:13:53.217
<i>That's right,
and do you remember...</i>

01:13:53.219 --> 01:13:56.520
<i>lying there on that field with
tears streaming down your face?</i>

01:13:56.522 --> 01:13:58.122
Yes, yeah.

01:13:58.124 --> 01:13:59.757
So does your dad...

01:13:59.759 --> 01:14:02.092
because he was right there
holding you the entire time.

01:14:02.094 --> 01:14:04.561
<i>Jim just showed you that?</i>

01:14:04.563 --> 01:14:06.096
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

01:14:06.098 --> 01:14:09.934
<i>Wow, that is powerful stuff.</i>

01:14:09.936 --> 01:14:12.970
Stacy, is there anything you'd
like to say to your father?

01:14:12.972 --> 01:14:15.539
Maybe some questions
that you want to ask?

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:19.976
Um, there's... there's so much.

01:14:19.978 --> 01:14:24.315
Um... Michael, I'm actually...

01:14:24.317 --> 01:14:26.883
I'm wondering if he's shown
you someone...

01:14:26.885 --> 01:14:29.886
um, a woman named Miss Angeline.

01:14:29.888 --> 01:14:32.556
Miss Angeline?

01:14:32.558 --> 01:14:34.624
Deny, Michael.

01:14:34.626 --> 01:14:38.562
<i>Yes, uh, I am getting
a response to that name.</i>

01:14:38.564 --> 01:14:40.330
Shit.

01:14:40.332 --> 01:14:42.233
<i>I'm seeing that she had quite
an impact on you.</i>

01:14:42.235 --> 01:14:43.935
She did, yeah.

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:45.836
What else are you seeing
about this Miss Angeline?

01:14:45.838 --> 01:14:49.873
Well, there's a lot of powerful,
positive energy around her.

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:52.075
I feel like she may have
been a teacher...

01:14:52.077 --> 01:14:54.110
or someone in a teacher-type
position...

01:14:54.112 --> 01:14:56.082
a caretaker of some kind.

01:14:57.616 --> 01:14:59.316
Maybe not in a literal sense...

01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:01.985
but that's the way that Jim
viewed her role in your life.

01:15:01.987 --> 01:15:03.253
Really?

01:15:03.255 --> 01:15:05.625
Stacy, who is Miss Angeline?

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:11.095
<i>A couple months
after my dad went missing...</i>

01:15:11.097 --> 01:15:12.829
<i>I did a talk show...</i>

01:15:12.831 --> 01:15:16.066
the 'very special episode'
like this one...

01:15:16.068 --> 01:15:19.203
and they brought in a psychic,
Miss Angeline.

01:15:19.205 --> 01:15:23.106
And she sat right where
you're sitting, Michael...

01:15:23.108 --> 01:15:27.979
and she smiled at me and she
told me that my dad...

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.748
was gonna come back before
I turned 13...

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:35.185
and I was... I was ecstatic.

01:15:35.187 --> 01:15:40.190
I mean, I would run home from
school every day just hoping...

01:15:40.192 --> 01:15:43.260
that, that would be the day
that, you know...

01:15:43.262 --> 01:15:46.230
he would... he would finally
show up.

01:15:46.232 --> 01:15:52.168
And... the night that
I turned 13...

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.373
I sat on the front step...

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:59.010
of my house and I had this
little flashlight...

01:15:59.012 --> 01:16:02.747
that I just shined up and down
the street, just waiting...

01:16:02.749 --> 01:16:08.752
<i>just waiting to see him...
and then midnight hit...</i>

01:16:08.754 --> 01:16:14.827
<i>and my grandmother had to
wrestle me into the house...</i>

01:16:15.928 --> 01:16:18.261
Sorry.

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:22.166
I just... I fell apart,
you know, it was like...

01:16:22.168 --> 01:16:26.203
my dad went missing all
over again.

01:16:26.205 --> 01:16:30.440
So, it's strange to me
that you would see...

01:16:30.442 --> 01:16:33.946
all this positive energy
around her.

01:16:36.348 --> 01:16:41.318
I agree, um, but I can say that
we don't always know...

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.020
the reasons for everything.

01:16:43.022 --> 01:16:46.891
So, maybe your father feels
there was a lesson...

01:16:46.893 --> 01:16:49.959
to be learned in this.

01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:53.799
I tried killing myself
three weeks later.

01:17:01.874 --> 01:17:05.077
<i>Stacy, may I take your hand?</i>

01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:08.044
I'd rather you didn't.

01:17:08.046 --> 01:17:10.847
It often helps to improve
the psychic connection.

01:17:10.849 --> 01:17:14.952
I'd rather you didn't.

01:17:14.954 --> 01:17:17.387
Okay.

01:17:17.389 --> 01:17:21.992
Um, I obviously can't speak
for this Miss Angeline...

01:17:21.994 --> 01:17:25.229
but it's possible that she
wasn't fully in tune...

01:17:25.231 --> 01:17:26.931
with your father's spirit.

01:17:26.933 --> 01:17:29.300
Or maybe she had no psychic
powers...

01:17:29.302 --> 01:17:32.736
and was lying to take advantage
of my story.

01:17:32.738 --> 01:17:34.404
<i>It would be heartbreaking...</i>

01:17:34.406 --> 01:17:36.006
<i>if that were the case.</i>

01:17:36.008 --> 01:17:37.108
<i>Have you been lying...</i>

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.008
<i>to take advantage of my story?</i>

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:41.011
<i>Unlike Miss Angeline, I have
a legitimate connection...</i>

01:17:41.013 --> 01:17:43.079
<i>to your father and it's
important to him...</i>

01:17:43.081 --> 01:17:44.414
<i>that you trust that.</i>

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:47.251
Stacy, you do believe
that Mr. Vaughn...

01:17:47.253 --> 01:17:50.053
was led to your father's
remains, right?

01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:54.158
Yeah... but not by my dad.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.860
Then by whom?

01:17:55.862 --> 01:17:58.162
Maybe by the man who put him
there.

01:17:58.164 --> 01:17:59.363
<i>That's obviously impossible...</i>

01:17:59.365 --> 01:18:01.164
<i>as I've said, that man...</i>

01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:02.800
<i>Is no longer
alive. Yeah, I know.</i>

01:18:02.802 --> 01:18:04.502
Of course, you also said
that my dad died...

01:18:04.504 --> 01:18:06.302
from a painless blow
to the head.

01:18:06.304 --> 01:18:09.840
You're asserting that Mr. Vaughn
got his information...

01:18:09.842 --> 01:18:11.475
- from another source?
- May I say something?

01:18:11.477 --> 01:18:15.546
I'm asserting that Mr. Vaughn
is not psychic.

01:18:15.548 --> 01:18:19.483
Which means, yes, he got his
information from another source.

01:18:19.485 --> 01:18:22.052
Pauline, I see this a lot.

01:18:22.054 --> 01:18:24.989
<i>Many people are
so entrenched in their grief...</i>

01:18:24.991 --> 01:18:28.124
<i>that they will push back
when I offer any ray of hope.</i>

01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:31.561
It's an understandable
emotional defense.

01:18:31.563 --> 01:18:33.499
I didn't break my ankle.

01:18:35.835 --> 01:18:39.270
I've never broken a bone.

01:18:39.272 --> 01:18:41.070
Many times when I'm shown
an injury...

01:18:41.072 --> 01:18:45.042
it can represent an emotional
or psychological trauma.

01:18:45.044 --> 01:18:47.343
You're a thief, Michael...

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:49.445
<i>you and Miss Angeline.</i>

01:18:49.447 --> 01:18:55.252
<i>Grieving people come to you
and you steal their loved ones.</i>

01:18:55.254 --> 01:18:57.187
I help people.

01:18:57.189 --> 01:19:00.457
And then you sell their loved
ones back to them.

01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:04.328
<i>But you've changed them,
your lies have twisted them...</i>

01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:08.097
<i>into something else, something
deformed, well, not this time.</i>

01:19:08.099 --> 01:19:11.771
You don't get my dad.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.109
<i>Well, I am
sorry that this sit-down...</i>

01:19:19.111 --> 01:19:21.011
<i>isn't providing the kind
of closure...</i>

01:19:21.013 --> 01:19:23.480
<i>that we all hoped it would.</i>

01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:27.318
<i>Is there anything that
Mr. Vaughn could say or do...</i>

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.622
<i>to bring you comfort
at this time?</i>

01:19:31.624 --> 01:19:36.392
My dad was murdered and he's
not coming back.

01:19:36.394 --> 01:19:38.098
So, no.

01:19:43.402 --> 01:19:45.970
On that sobering thought,
we'll send it back...

01:19:45.972 --> 01:19:47.971
to our studio in New York.

01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:49.340
Thank you, Stacy.

01:19:49.342 --> 01:19:51.175
Thank you, Michael.

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:54.310
And thank you for tuning in to
this fascinating discussion.

01:19:54.312 --> 01:19:58.551
From Lone Valley, Nevada,
I'm Pauline Williams, goodnight.

01:20:01.219 --> 01:20:02.454
And we're clear.

01:20:06.392 --> 01:20:08.094
Get out of my house.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.977
How do you respond to Ms.
Bishop's accusations, Michael?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.247
Michael?

01:21:03.249 --> 01:21:04.315
I need you to come get me.

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:05.682
I can't.

01:21:05.684 --> 01:21:07.517
<i>Chelsea,
goddamn it, I'm sorry, okay?</i>

01:21:07.519 --> 01:21:10.055
You were right! I need
your help!

01:21:12.558 --> 01:21:14.261
Is he with you?

01:21:17.062 --> 01:21:18.898
Yeah.

01:21:25.137 --> 01:21:26.436
Where are you?

01:21:26.438 --> 01:21:29.306
Oh, fuck...

01:21:29.308 --> 01:21:30.740
Nathan, what are you doing,
buddy?

01:21:30.742 --> 01:21:33.043
That didn't go the way
that you promised.

01:21:33.045 --> 01:21:35.279
To be fair, I didn't make
any promises.

01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:38.382
Nothing has gone the way
that you promised.

01:21:38.384 --> 01:21:40.450
And I think we should
talk it through, okay?

01:21:40.452 --> 01:21:43.252
This lady, how important
is she to you?

01:21:43.254 --> 01:21:45.055
<i>Nathan, this
is not about her, okay?</i>

01:21:45.057 --> 01:21:46.293
<i>This is about you and me.</i>

01:21:48.393 --> 01:21:49.993
All right, listen, I'm gonna
come to you, okay?

01:21:49.995 --> 01:21:51.430
But you have to promise
not to hurt her.

01:21:53.064 --> 01:21:56.303
Nathan! Shit.

01:22:31.737 --> 01:22:34.171
C'mon, c'mon.

01:22:34.173 --> 01:22:35.342
Nathan, I'm outside.

01:22:37.043 --> 01:22:38.978
Okay, I need to know that
she's okay.

01:22:49.054 --> 01:22:51.055
Okay, we... we can't stay here,
there are police looking...

01:22:51.057 --> 01:22:53.727
for both of us, so take
Chelsea's car and follow me.

01:23:00.198 --> 01:23:01.500
Fuck.

01:23:04.836 --> 01:23:08.471
Excuse me, you can't park here!

01:23:08.473 --> 01:23:10.373
Michael, what are you doing
in here?

01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:11.542
It's a long a story.

01:23:11.544 --> 01:23:13.543
I saw you on the show earlier.

01:23:13.545 --> 01:23:16.547
I started wondering if you've
been completely honest with me.

01:23:16.549 --> 01:23:19.182
Can you go the fuck back
to bed, please?

01:23:19.184 --> 01:23:20.484
I gave you good news.

01:23:20.486 --> 01:23:22.252
You got to feel closer
to your husband.

01:23:22.254 --> 01:23:24.390
Can you be happy with that
and go back to bed, please?

01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:33.699
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

01:24:19.445 --> 01:24:21.177
Hello?

01:24:21.179 --> 01:24:22.445
<i>Mike.</i>

01:24:22.447 --> 01:24:24.213
Dad?

01:24:24.215 --> 01:24:28.284
<i>Mom and I just
watched you on the TV.</i>

01:24:28.286 --> 01:24:30.587
In the million times I imagined
hearing you say that...

01:24:30.589 --> 01:24:33.293
this was not the scenario
I had in mind.

01:24:35.294 --> 01:24:36.659
<i>Listen,
I can't really handle...</i>

01:24:36.661 --> 01:24:38.694
<i>a sermon right now.</i>

01:24:38.696 --> 01:24:41.567
We're calling to see if there's
anything we could do.

01:24:46.371 --> 01:24:50.207
I'm not sure what's gonna
happen right now...

01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:54.444
but I may need to crawl
into a hole for a while...

01:24:54.446 --> 01:24:58.849
so maybe I could come stay
with you and Mom for a bit?

01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:01.618
<i>That'd be fine.</i>

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.686
<i>Whatever you need, Mike.</i>

01:25:03.688 --> 01:25:06.657
Okay, I, uh... I gotta go.

01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:09.892
Mom and I are praying for you.

01:25:09.894 --> 01:25:14.631
I know that's not something
you believe in...

01:25:14.633 --> 01:25:20.706
but it's a thing you say
to... make people feel better.

01:25:24.509 --> 01:25:25.742
Thank you.

01:25:25.744 --> 01:25:27.514
<i>Okay.</i>

01:25:40.759 --> 01:25:45.665
He may come see us, stay with
us for a little while.

01:26:04.916 --> 01:26:09.321
He lied about all of it,
didn't he?

01:26:13.925 --> 01:26:15.661
Didn't he?

01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:20.934
Michael tells people what
they're desperate to hear.

01:26:24.937 --> 01:26:27.740
And then they do the lying
to themselves.

01:26:31.509 --> 01:26:33.879
It's Chelsea, right?

01:26:35.313 --> 01:26:37.381
Uh-huh.

01:26:37.383 --> 01:26:40.751
I killed a man up here, Chelsea.

01:26:40.753 --> 01:26:43.956
'Course, he was supposed to
already been dead.

01:26:46.357 --> 01:26:51.863
It was the luckiest break
of my life, he was still alive.

01:26:54.732 --> 01:26:57.570
I could have just let him walk,
driven away.

01:27:04.076 --> 01:27:07.380
We could have both been living
our lives right now.

01:27:28.067 --> 01:27:29.836
Keys.

01:27:32.036 --> 01:27:34.006
I'm sorry if I scared you.

01:27:40.411 --> 01:27:42.979
- Michael...
- Let... let me talk, Nathan.

01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:44.580
All right, there's...
there's been a lot...

01:27:44.582 --> 01:27:46.983
of crazy accusations tossed
around tonight.

01:27:46.985 --> 01:27:50.052
All right, there's a lot
of confusion, a lot of anger.

01:27:50.054 --> 01:27:54.024
But before you do anything,
Jim wants you to hear him out.

01:27:54.026 --> 01:27:55.792
It's time to be done
with the lying.

01:27:55.794 --> 01:27:57.660
Jim needs to explain, so that
you understand clearly...

01:27:57.662 --> 01:27:59.765
I need you to stop talking.

01:28:01.467 --> 01:28:05.502
Fine. Chelsea, lock the doors!

01:28:08.139 --> 01:28:10.740
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:28:10.742 --> 01:28:13.079
Bullshit, then what's that for?

01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:26.890
So what happens now?

01:28:26.892 --> 01:28:30.427
I walk away, like I wish
to Christ...

01:28:30.429 --> 01:28:32.729
I'd done that night with Jim.

01:28:32.731 --> 01:28:38.534
Well, that's good, Nathan,
that, uh... that shows...

01:28:38.536 --> 01:28:41.374
That shows real growth,
I'm proud of you.

01:28:43.409 --> 01:28:44.975
I'm trying.

01:28:44.977 --> 01:28:49.349
I told you... this was
a beautiful thing, right?

01:28:51.082 --> 01:28:53.385
So let's go, let's get you home.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.953
You go on ahead.

01:28:56.955 --> 01:28:59.588
You can't stay here,
they're looking for you.

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:02.626
That's what they're supposed to
do, that's... that's their job.

01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:05.662
What are you doing? I'm trying
to help you.

01:29:05.664 --> 01:29:09.199
You've already helped me, you
had me convinced that I was...

01:29:09.201 --> 01:29:12.105
a... a good person for a little
while.

01:29:14.839 --> 01:29:17.039
I really liked the way
that felt.

01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:19.208
But you are a good person.

01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:25.681
Like I said, we're done
with the lying, all of it.

01:29:25.683 --> 01:29:27.016
You're not turning yourself
in...

01:29:27.018 --> 01:29:28.687
we talked about why
that's a bad idea.

01:29:31.723 --> 01:29:36.162
I thought about it, I think
you're gonna be all right.

01:29:37.995 --> 01:29:43.667
You did what you did, because
you were helping people.

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:46.136
I really think they're gonna
take that into consideration.

01:29:46.138 --> 01:29:48.104
That's not how it works, Nathan.

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:51.106
I need to borrow your car.

01:29:51.108 --> 01:29:53.976
Hold on, wait! Just wait,
Nathan...

01:29:53.978 --> 01:29:56.745
Nathan, there are other moves
to make here, okay?

01:29:56.747 --> 01:29:58.547
I have book deals, I have TV
deals.

01:29:58.549 --> 01:29:59.983
I can make you very comfortable!

01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:02.819
That's really generous of you
to offer.

01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:05.689
I can't let you do this to me,
Nathan!

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:07.023
Step aside.

01:30:07.025 --> 01:30:08.894
Not if you're going to the
police!

01:30:11.863 --> 01:30:13.997
It doesn't work out.

01:30:13.999 --> 01:30:15.968
It does for me.

01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:19.906
Nathan!

01:30:21.906 --> 01:30:23.873
That was a warning!

01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:26.642
Okay, I didn't want to have to
do that, but you forced me.

01:30:26.644 --> 01:30:28.511
So just... let's talk about
a solution...

01:30:28.513 --> 01:30:30.946
that could work for everyone,
okay?

01:30:30.948 --> 01:30:36.619
Stop! Nathan! Let it go!

01:30:36.621 --> 01:30:39.154
Don't! Stop!

01:30:39.156 --> 01:30:41.126
No! Stop! Stop!

01:30:42.894 --> 01:30:43.995
Oh, my god!

01:30:48.534 --> 01:30:50.900
I warned him. You heard me!

01:30:50.902 --> 01:30:52.935
We're okay, it's not a problem.

01:30:52.937 --> 01:30:55.004
We are okay, all right?
It's not a problem.

01:30:55.006 --> 01:30:56.205
I'm gonna take care of it.

01:31:35.714 --> 01:31:39.585
It's all taken care of,
we're good.

01:31:40.952 --> 01:31:43.118
It had to happen.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.288
You heard him, he was gonna
ruin everything.

01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:51.595
And honestly, he deserved it.
What he did to Jim?

01:31:51.597 --> 01:31:53.265
He's a fucking monster.

01:31:56.867 --> 01:31:58.737
You okay?

01:32:00.371 --> 01:32:02.541
What are you thinking?

01:32:06.044 --> 01:32:07.813
I'm thinking you were right.

01:32:10.214 --> 01:32:15.185
I do deserve better than eating
alone in hotel bars every night.

01:32:15.187 --> 01:32:17.354
And now you don't have to.

01:32:17.356 --> 01:32:20.289
Because of those book
and TV deals?

01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:22.257
Exactly.

01:32:22.259 --> 01:32:27.998
And I know, the Stacy
reading tonight wasn't ideal...

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.235
but trust me, people are gonna
forget about that in a month.

01:32:33.237 --> 01:32:36.308
There's still gonna be plenty
of heat around Michael Vaughn.

01:32:38.309 --> 01:32:41.144
So what's your big plan?

01:32:41.146 --> 01:32:43.812
The plan is whatever
you say it is.

01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:45.280
You're the boss.

01:32:45.282 --> 01:32:48.685
I don't make any moves
without your blessing.

01:32:48.687 --> 01:32:49.985
The last time you promised
that...

01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:52.223
I ended up with a knife
to my throat.

01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:57.961
I am gonna regret that
for the rest of my life.

01:32:57.963 --> 01:33:01.364
But think about this...

01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:05.001
you've got something now
that can sink me for good.

01:33:05.003 --> 01:33:10.643
You own me, Chels, you call
the shots.

01:33:17.115 --> 01:33:21.284
You have to deal with that
first.

01:33:21.286 --> 01:33:26.288
Right, uh, look, I'll dump it
somewhere on the edge of town.

01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:29.160
Then you can pick me up and
we'll get out of here.

01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:33.299
All right.

01:33:36.835 --> 01:33:38.337
Get out.

01:33:45.811 --> 01:33:50.383
Chelsea and Michael... it's the
way it's supposed to be.

01:34:08.467 --> 01:34:09.934
Police!

01:34:13.338 --> 01:34:18.307
Chelsea! You told them?

01:34:18.309 --> 01:34:21.444
What am I gonna do?
What's gonna happen to me?

01:34:21.446 --> 01:34:25.184
You're Michael Vaughn.
You'll think of something.

01:34:47.339 --> 01:34:49.305
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:34:49.307 --> 01:34:51.407
Oh, god, thank god you're here!
Michael killed that guy!

01:34:51.409 --> 01:34:52.876
I'll stay with her!
Go after him, Danny!

01:34:52.878 --> 01:34:54.511
I thought he was gonna
kill me, too!

01:34:54.513 --> 01:34:56.445
- Did he hurt you?
- No, no, I'm okay.

01:34:56.447 --> 01:35:00.048
All right, I want to know
as soon as you hear anything!

01:35:03.187 --> 01:35:05.990
You got him? I see him,
he's right there!

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.062
Right there! Right over there!

01:35:24.809 --> 01:35:27.310
Uh, remind me...
what's your card again?

01:35:27.312 --> 01:35:28.380
Three of Clubs.

01:35:34.419 --> 01:35:36.852
Yo, how do you do that?

01:35:36.854 --> 01:35:39.489
I'm serious, bro, show me
how you do that.

01:35:39.491 --> 01:35:42.958
- I'd love to, but I can't.
- Quit bullshittin' me, bro.

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.828
Teach me the fuckin' trick!

01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:48.064
Well, I can't teach you how
to have magic, it's a gift.

01:35:48.066 --> 01:35:49.833
It's the thing that makes me
special.

01:35:49.835 --> 01:35:51.200
Special? You feelin' special?

01:35:51.202 --> 01:35:53.002
If you're so fucking special...

01:35:53.004 --> 01:35:55.538
why don't you magic your ass
out of this fuckin' place?

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.209
Fuck boy.

01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:11.921
<i>Honestly, it was a nightmare.</i>

01:36:11.923 --> 01:36:16.391
<i>The outpouring of support
I received from people...</i>

01:36:16.393 --> 01:36:21.467
<i>was incredible, and that really
helped the healing process.</i>

01:36:23.101 --> 01:36:24.534
Hey, can you turn that back?

01:36:24.536 --> 01:36:26.235
Fuck you.

01:36:26.237 --> 01:36:31.106
Could you... can you turn it back
for one minute, please?

01:36:31.108 --> 01:36:33.275
<i>I'm a kind of a professional
skeptic, so just...</i>

01:36:33.277 --> 01:36:39.449
<i>after all of those years,
you had no idea, not a clue...</i>

01:36:39.451 --> 01:36:41.083
<i>that Michael Vaughn
was a fraud?</i>

01:36:41.085 --> 01:36:43.151
<i>I know it sounds crazy...</i>

01:36:43.153 --> 01:36:48.024
<i>but I truly thought he could
talk to the spirit world.</i>

01:36:48.026 --> 01:36:51.060
<i>And if someone's convinced
you of that...</i>

01:36:51.062 --> 01:36:53.029
<i>they can convince you
of a lot of things.</i>

01:36:53.031 --> 01:36:57.600
<i>But for all the pain
Michael's lies caused me...</i>

01:36:57.602 --> 01:37:02.437
<i>I have to believe it was all
for a purpose.</i>

01:37:02.439 --> 01:37:07.010
<i>Crazy or not, it is a
fascinating story, I must say.</i>

01:37:07.012 --> 01:37:09.678
<i>Now, folks, if you haven't
picked up her New York Times...</i>

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.949
<i>best-selling book, you have
to read this.</i>

01:37:12.951 --> 01:37:16.418
