WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.440
[Uhtred] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.520 --> 00:15.560
<i>A great battle has been won,</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:18.360
<i>but the Saxons</i>
<i>do not find themselves at peace.</i>

00:18.440 --> 00:21.520
You’ve chosen Mercia
over the Kingdom of Alfred.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.120
<i>In Winchester, Lady Aelswith</i>
<i>has also worked to her own plan.</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:28.440
You will take a message to the Welsh king.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.160
<i>And a rivalry simmers</i>
<i>with the new queen Aelflaed.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:35.600
Lady Aelswith was seen visiting
Edward’s bastard at the monastery.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.720
What business has she showing kindness
to a whore and her offspring?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.720
<i>Yet my part is done.</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:42.920
<i>I turned away from Saxon conflict</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:45.760
<i>and looked to uniting</i>
<i>with my daughter Stiorra.</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:48.200
I want to make a home
for my children to return to.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.080
Stiorra thrives.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.880
<i>She's now grown and is at Saltwic</i>
<i>with Aelfwynn, Aethelflaed’s daughter,</i>

00:54.960 --> 00:57.760
<i>and another child, a mysterious boy.</i>

00:57.840 --> 01:00.160
Who are your family?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.840
I’ve been told not to answer that.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.800
<i>And though I hope</i>
<i>the gods will allow peace,</i>

01:05.880 --> 01:09.080
<i>I fear ambitions will lead us back to war.</i>

01:09.160 --> 01:12.800
When we return to Aegelesburg,
I will publicly castrate you!

01:12.880 --> 01:16.800
<i>But the heat of battle has brought</i>
<i>Eardwulf unexpected reward.</i>

01:18.640 --> 01:20.440
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

02:02.280 --> 02:03.680
[guard] <i>Open the gate!</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:05.720
[gate opens]

02:05.800 --> 02:07.160
[horse neighs]

02:20.760 --> 02:21.720
[Eardwulf] Halt!

02:29.920 --> 02:33.560
[murmuring]

02:37.200 --> 02:38.160
Make way!

02:40.040 --> 02:40.880
[man] Gently.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.320
Lift him. Careful.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.520
Have no fear. He will recover.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.640
[whispers] Stop praying for him to die.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.600
-We will be blamed for this.
-Not if we blame him first.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.160
[door opens]

03:40.840 --> 03:41.760
[horse snorts]

03:43.440 --> 03:44.760
[horse neighs]

03:45.760 --> 03:47.240
[metal banging]

03:48.720 --> 03:49.560
Stiorra!

03:50.200 --> 03:52.760
-Open the doors!
-Perhaps she is sleeping.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.680
Stiorra, wake up. It is your father.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.800
[Stiorra] Stay back and name yourselves.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.480
My father calls himself Uhtred
of Bebbanburg. Who are you?

04:02.560 --> 04:05.360
Stiorra, it is us. It really is.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.840
Father has defeated the Danes.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.640
I’ve come to take you home.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.440
-You’re lucky I didn’t stab you.
-[Uhtred chuckles]

04:26.680 --> 04:27.520
[both laugh]

04:32.320 --> 04:35.480
The battle was never close.
We would not have left you in danger.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.480
There have been rumors
of retreating fighters.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.240
We made a plan if we were attacked.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.480
-Where’s my daughter?
-Aelfwynn!

04:44.040 --> 04:47.320
-[Stiorra] Aelfwynn, your mother is here!
-[bird chirping]

04:51.760 --> 04:52.800
Mother!

04:54.320 --> 04:55.280
I’ve missed you!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.360
Oh, I’ve missed you too!

04:58.720 --> 05:00.840
Aethelstan! You can come out.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.240
Cnut has been sent to hell!

05:07.240 --> 05:08.200
Who’s the boy?

05:08.920 --> 05:10.080
I am no one.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.640
I will explain later.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.040
Father, when do we ride home to Coccham?
Tonight?

05:19.120 --> 05:21.560
No, but soon, once the peace is secure.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.040
Please! I’m too old to be stuck here
with children!

05:25.120 --> 05:26.040
Stiorra!

05:26.840 --> 05:28.080
[Stiorra sighs]

05:31.240 --> 05:32.280
[door opens]

05:34.800 --> 05:37.080
[Finan] Lord Aldhelm approaches
from the road.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.360
[Aldhelm sighs]

05:51.440 --> 05:53.800
Lady, Aethelred is injured.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.720
Some are saying fatally.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.200
There’s a rumor he will not last the week.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.760
-We must go to him.
-Tomorrow.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.000
-These roads are too dangerous at night--
-We must speak to him and the Ealdormen.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.720
No plan has been made for the succession.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.240
Lady, the mood amongst the Ealdormen
is ugly.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.320
Those who survived the massacre
blame Aethelred for deserting them

06:11.400 --> 06:13.800
and denounce your brother
for not coming to their aid.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.440
Does this anger extend to Aethelflaed?

06:17.720 --> 06:18.720
I don’t know.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.560
-We ride at first light.
-[Aldhelm] Lady.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.280
[Uhtred] Stiorra, take the children
and secure yourselves.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.960
Open the door to no one but us.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.240
Why? You said the Danes were defeated?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.720
-It is not just the Danes we have to fear.
-What?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.680
How much longer will I live
like a prisoner?

06:34.760 --> 06:36.840
She is young to take on such a burden.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.400
You were betrothed by her age
and suffered worse.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.360
They will remain secure
until the new threats have passed.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.080
We should not leave the children
unprotected any longer.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.520
My men will stay here.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.120
If Aethelred dies, times will be unstable.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.320
An empty throne provokes more trouble
than a weak king.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.720
Our traditions are strong. The Ealdormen
will choose a wise successor.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.200
And what if that successor
seeks to have you removed?

07:00.280 --> 07:02.400
Widows are rarely welcome
in times of change.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.560
-Look at your mother.
-Mercia is my home.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.560
Yet you have no formal protection here,
no son or father to speak for you.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.400
At best, they will send you to a nunnery

07:10.480 --> 07:12.800
and marry your daughter
to the highest bidder.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.400
No! Aelfwynn will not suffer
because of this.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.560
So leave.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.360
And come to Coccham,
where I can protect you both.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.400
[Aethelflaed sighs]

07:22.440 --> 07:25.120
Unless you want to live a life
of prayer and chastity.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.400
The Ealdormen will not turn on us.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.480
Battle does not always bring reward,
Aethelflaed.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.960
This much I have learned.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.880
[breathes heavily]

07:52.200 --> 07:54.480
[Ealdormen whispering indistinctly]

07:59.240 --> 08:00.840
Why do the Ealdormen circle?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.160
How long have I been sleeping?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.720
Since the day of the battle, Lord.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.360
-You fell and injured your head.
-Did we win?

08:10.680 --> 08:12.080
I remember very little.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.760
We did. We returned from East Anglia
and sent the Danes running to the sea.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.200
[gasps and breathes heavily]

08:25.760 --> 08:28.600
Who in the name of God
advised that we go to East Anglia?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.160
Um...

08:33.040 --> 08:33.880
You did.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.720
Then news came of the invasion
and we returned to protect our people.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.159
After hundreds
had already been slaughtered.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.799
I remember arriving at the battle...

08:46.480 --> 08:48.240
but I...

08:53.880 --> 08:56.920
-Am I to recover?
-[Eardwulf] I’m assured that you will.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.440
[gasps and breathes heavily]

09:06.360 --> 09:09.000
Why do you lie to him
when he is certain to die?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.280
I ease him in his time of need.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.400
More like in his time of judgment.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.000
What is this but punishment
for greed and ambition?

09:17.080 --> 09:20.000
-Burgred.
-He left us to face the Danes alone.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.960
Took all the defenses we had and for what?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.680
A few miles of marshland
barely able to yield a crop?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.600
Burgred.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.640
I will speak
for I have nothing else to lose!

09:30.200 --> 09:32.400
My eldest, pulled from my hands, be...

09:34.440 --> 09:35.600
beheaded.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.080
My youngest and my wife beaten.

09:39.160 --> 09:44.320
Men of honor paraded and humiliated,
and no one came to help us!

09:44.400 --> 09:46.000
And yet we survived.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.800
I will not honor him.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.840
And nor should you, Burgred,
not after all that you’ve suffered.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.280
Suffice to say that I did all I could
to persuade him to return sooner...

10:00.480 --> 10:01.520
but I failed.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.360
Trust me, the Mercian Guard
feel your loss deeply.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.680
Aldhelm, have you spoken
with the Ealdormen?

10:20.760 --> 10:22.520
There’s to be a Witan with the survivors.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.160
[Uhtred] Perhaps I will address them.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.040
They can thank me
for bringing Cnut to the field.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.200
-Perhaps you should remain here.
-[Uhtred] You do not want me with you?

10:30.280 --> 10:33.000
[Ludeca speaks angrily and indistinctly]

10:33.080 --> 10:37.160
Times are feverish.
Now is a moment for calm negotiation.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.360
The men who play politics always say that.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.960
And then they come running for my help.
[sighs]

10:47.240 --> 10:51.280
I demand you do not leave the room.
We are in love, are we not?

10:56.800 --> 10:59.960
Did he mention my mistake?
Does he blame me for our late return?

11:00.040 --> 11:03.200
-[whispers] He has not spoken of you.
-Good. Perhaps he’s forgotten.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.800
If he has, it will not be for long.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.120
-We should leave before his mind repairs.
-No, we will stay until he dies.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.560
There is an opportunity
to regain our influence.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.080
-Brother, no--
-No, listen.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.320
The Mercian Guard are loyal to me,
and the Ealdormen are against him.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.600
Groups are forming as the ravens circle.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.200
-I could be a peacemaker between them.
-Brother, this is madness.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.720
We’ve played with fire
and found ourselves burnt.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.760
Lady Aethelflaed.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.920
-Are you the woman who is healing him?
-No.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.560
Merely sitting by his side.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.680
My name is Eadith.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.640
I’ve heard your name.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.880
You must be her brother whose late entry
into battle helped us prevail.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.080
-Our actions were decisive, Lady.
-If a little delayed.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.600
-I'd like to speak to my husband alone.
-Lady.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.080
I command the Mercian Guard.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.480
-I only take orders from Lord Aethelred.
-[Ealdorman 1] Lady.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.040
[Ealdorman 2] Lady Aethelflaed.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.000
Are you questioning whether I know
the mind of my own husband?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.600
No, of course not. We will withdraw.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.240
[footsteps receding]

12:09.640 --> 12:10.960
[softly] Aethelflaed.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.760
I must be dying if you’re here.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.600
I am certain
God will restore you to health.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.840
I fear that may not be true.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.240
Priests have prayed over me
as though preparing the final rites.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.800
[sighs]

12:27.760 --> 12:29.560
They will not meet my eye.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.800
And nor will you.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.200
Why have you come?

12:36.240 --> 12:37.520
To revel in my suffering?

12:40.560 --> 12:43.320
I am concerned about the fate
of our daughter,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.400
should you be taken from us.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.200
Without a father to protect her, I wish
to ensure she is not further abused.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.920
-You have treated her most unkindly.
-That’s because she is not my daughter.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.840
I may struggle to remember,
but that I know.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.480
So, you must also know
the people regard her as your daughter.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.760
-She is rather fair for a Mercian...
-And that consequently,

13:06.320 --> 13:09.600
they will seek her hand
to support their claim to your title.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.080
So, what is it that you want?

13:12.160 --> 13:16.040
At the very least, you agree
not to betroth her to some heartless fool.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.600
As you were?

13:21.680 --> 13:24.800
Our union brought us misery,
and the people knew it.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.760
It created a crack in Mercia
that did not serve it well.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
The Ealdormen of marriageable age
were all slaughtered...

13:33.880 --> 13:35.400
the best of them taken.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.320
There’s a danger dishonorable hands
will try to grasp her.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.200
-So?
-So, allow me to choose someone suitable

13:44.280 --> 13:46.880
and I promise you,
this kingdom will thrive.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.400
I agree. You should approve the match.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.480
If only you were as faithful to me
as you are to Mercia.

14:02.760 --> 14:06.040
If you had not treated me with
so much cruelty since our wedding night,

14:06.120 --> 14:08.960
perhaps things could have been
very different between us.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.560
If you fear death,
now is the moment to ask for forgiveness.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.080
Who ordained you confessor?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.360
Then let it be between you and your God.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.280
May he weigh you in the balance
for all you have done.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.960
[footsteps receding]

14:40.240 --> 14:41.080
Aethelflaed!

14:43.800 --> 14:46.360
I know
that I have not always treated you kindly.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.640
For that, I am sorry.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.920
I was younger and more foolish.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.200
And, as for you,
I hope that you can find some comfort.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.960
To live without being loved is a torture.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.840
Which is why you acted
with so much cruelty?

15:30.560 --> 15:33.920
[men shouting indistinctly]

15:40.080 --> 15:43.640
If I may say, Lord King,
I think this is unwise.

15:43.720 --> 15:48.560
Injured or not, Aethelred will be held
to account for abandoning Mercia.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.240
I say let them drown in a turmoil
of their own making.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.960
Turned out well for us last time,
leaving them to it.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.040
Until the enormous battle.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.560
Indeed, Father Pyrlig knows
how to win battles.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.600
[chuckles]

16:00.680 --> 16:01.760
We won the war.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.360
Now we must help bring about the peace.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.560
Mercia does not need any more instability.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.960
-And what about the people of Winchester?
-Indeed.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.160
Have my mother publicly rebuked
for raising King Hywel's army.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.960
She must learn her interference
brings a cost.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.120
-Cenric!
-Lord.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.560
Have our men directed here
to help rebuild the town.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.840
-Lord.
-The Mercians are proud people.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.880
I doubt they will want our help.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.480
We will not ignore their plight again.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
[Ealdormen argue]

16:47.480 --> 16:51.280
[Burgred] Our Lord will not recover!
We should not delay the decision!

16:51.360 --> 16:54.240
[Ludeca] We are too few
to pass a decision!

16:54.320 --> 16:58.480
We should wait until other Ealdormen
have arrived from all parts of Mercia!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.960
That is how it has been done
and shall continue!

17:01.040 --> 17:04.440
-But the matter is pressing, Ludeca.
-Yes!

17:04.520 --> 17:06.160
And the next successor is clear.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.720
[Ealdormen argue]

17:07.800 --> 17:10.400
My younger son's claim is strong
through his uncle...

17:10.760 --> 17:15.319
and he is untainted by a connection
to disloyal Wessex.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.960
Your son is too young, Burgred.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.200
Oh, come on!

17:19.280 --> 17:23.280
If the worst should befall our Kingdom,
we will need a man of wisdom!

17:23.359 --> 17:24.200
Oh, wisdom!

17:24.680 --> 17:26.839
And who would you be thinking of, Ludeca?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.480
[Ealdorman] He may yet be well enough
to announce his own successor.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.920
We should speak to them.
They talk in circles.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.240
-They will not offer me a chance to speak.
-They can refuse you?

17:36.320 --> 17:39.000
They say I should be
at Aethelred's bedside.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.760
Tell me it is less disordered
than it looks.

17:43.840 --> 17:44.720
I cannot.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.920
There is division. There is anger.
They think Wessex has abandoned them.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.440
And there is talk
that they do not honor the union.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.240
As in Mercia break from Wessex?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.360
-[Aldhelm] Some are saying that, yes.
-[sighs]

18:00.440 --> 18:04.680
Then we must appease them. I understand
their frustrations with my husband,

18:04.760 --> 18:07.200
but to sever Saxon unity
would hurt us all.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.720
We must remain united.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.480
[healer chants prayer]

18:13.560 --> 18:16.680
[Aethelred pants]

18:25.120 --> 18:27.240
Lord Aethelred, I heard you were injured.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.200
Yes, I...

18:32.000 --> 18:33.760
Forgive me if I do not get up.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.560
They told me that...

18:47.560 --> 18:49.320
Has your father sent you?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.000
What...

19:00.840 --> 19:03.040
He will be in his shroud
before the week is out.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.360
You must act decisively to install
someone here before chaos breaks out.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.560
His successor is decided by the Ealdormen.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.800
And who decides what the Ealdormen decide?

19:11.880 --> 19:13.640
I cannot simply march into Mercia

19:13.720 --> 19:15.840
and tell them how to conduct
their affairs.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.000
I've not been as attentive to them
as I should have.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.840
Fortunately, you are already here.
So, no marching is required.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.080
Danish survivors have been spotted
heading east.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.160
Should we send a band to capture them?

19:27.120 --> 19:30.840
No, all forces must come here
to Aegelesburg.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.520
-Are those the Ealdormen?
-Yes.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
What do we know of them
and their intentions?

19:40.680 --> 19:43.680
Those two reckon they have
a chance to take the title.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.120
The gray-haired one,
Ludeca, wants the kingdom

19:46.200 --> 19:48.200
and hasn't the balls to fight for it.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.240
The other, Burgred, wants it for his son,
but no one likes him enough to say yes.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.560
Could this son be betrothed
to your niece Lady Aelfwynn?

19:56.640 --> 19:59.120
Bring a successor under your wing
with a family connection?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.840
It worked for your father.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.040
A child on the throne
will not bring security.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.960
Let us meet
with the older Ealdorman Ludeca.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.760
He is likely to be the most reasonable.
First, I must speak with my sister.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.040
Lord?

20:22.360 --> 20:24.560
It appears there might be new turbulence.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.800
Tell the Wessex Guards
to settle within the walls.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.480
-Of course.
-Oh.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.920
And that command
to punish the King's mother,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.760
that is an order
you yourself could undertake?

20:36.040 --> 20:38.040
Was punishment what the King commanded?

20:38.120 --> 20:41.960
It’s what he wants
but cannot order directly.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.360
He feels
the Lady Aelswith needs... containing.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.000
Brother, you have heard
of my husband's injury?

20:57.080 --> 21:00.880
Yes, I've seen him. Should he die,
what are the plans for the succession?

21:00.960 --> 21:03.240
It is not clear.
The Ealdormen are much diminished.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.240
There is talk of a break from Wessex.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.800
They wish to abandon the alliance
between Wessex and Mercia.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.000
-They feel you have abandoned them.
-That cannot happen.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.040
If Tettenhall has taught us anything,

21:13.120 --> 21:16.080
it is that the two kingdoms stand stronger
when they are together.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.840
-I know--
-I cannot preside over

21:17.920 --> 21:19.320
the breaking of our alliance

21:19.400 --> 21:22.400
and I will not allow the fracturing
of our father's dream!

21:25.760 --> 21:28.480
We will betroth the Lady Aelfwynn
to the successor

21:28.560 --> 21:30.160
and seal the bond between our lands.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.480
In return for the strength
she’ll bring to their claim in Mercia,

21:33.560 --> 21:35.240
we will ask they are loyal to Wessex.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.880
I agree with the idea,
but it is not that simple.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.280
The best of the young Ealdormen
have been slaughtered.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.400
There's no one suitable.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.280
[Edward] Then we will find
someone suitable.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.920
Lord King, the men who remain
are not well disposed to you.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.360
-There’s no obvious choice.
-Where is the Lady Aelfwynn now?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.880
Safe at Saltwic with my men.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.680
Bring her here
and we will settle the matter.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.120
No! We will settle the matter
and then we will bring her here.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.480
Aegelesburg is volatile.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.760
Surely it is best
if she is with her family.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.240
She's too young to be used as bait.

22:03.360 --> 22:07.080
Find me the right suitor
and we will make haste to arrange a match.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.040
I promise you, brother, this alliance
means as much to me as it does to you.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.800
Bring the Ealdormen to me.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.840
Have no fear, I will resolve this.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.640
Keep an eye on the Ealdormen yourself.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.280
I will find out
how long Edward intends to stay.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.920
My brother is finally trying to enact
my father's will. We should welcome this.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.400
I know, but his authority is under threat

22:31.480 --> 22:34.280
and men under threat
do not always act with wisdom.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.520
[footsteps receding]

22:42.240 --> 22:45.160
Show respect for the fallen of Tettenhall!

22:57.400 --> 22:59.960
[woman gasps and sobs]

23:00.040 --> 23:03.280
[sobs]

23:07.200 --> 23:09.560
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.920
You must pay your respects, Aelfweard.
Come with me.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.080
He is too young to be displayed
before the people.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.920
If he's to send men to war,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
as the future king of Wessex,
he must know the consequences.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.160
I will not try and woo King Edward!

23:38.240 --> 23:41.720
I’m not asking you to hump him,
merely ingratiate yourself, as will I.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
Why would we try a plan
that has failed before?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.080
Has it failed?
We’re in the palace, are we not?

23:46.160 --> 23:47.920
By luck, nothing more.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.160
-You’re giving up too easily.
-And you are living a fantasy.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.240
Take this opportunity and escape.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.920
Go back to having nothing?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.200
And avoid the turmoil
that will unfold when Aethelred dies.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.480
I am mistress to a dead king.
You are the favorite of a dead king.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.480
Since when have such people thrived?

24:05.560 --> 24:07.600
Edward is not foolish like Aethelred.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.560
Please, brother,
see what is real and what is not.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.080
For a whore, you lack ambition.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.320
-What did you say?
-Every plan we’ve made, you’ve agreed to.

24:20.120 --> 24:24.000
You cannot choose to play and then run,
when it gets a little dangerous.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.720
[Uhtred] Aethelflaed. [breathes heavily]

24:26.800 --> 24:29.400
Edward has ordered all his troops
to Aegelesburg.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.040
He is just being cautious.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.720
Or he’s expecting a fight.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.960
There will be no fight,
because we will find a resolution.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.680
Trust him. He knows now not to put
one kingdom before the other.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.640
[Eadith] I am going to Frankia
before your insanity drowns us both!

24:42.720 --> 24:45.800
You will go nowhere without my permission!

24:46.480 --> 24:47.920
Is all well, Lady?

24:48.920 --> 24:49.760
Yes.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.800
He is my brother
and it is just a foolish disagreement.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.800
My husband is asking for you.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.800
Attend to him, please.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.040
What kind of a man treats his sister
this way?

25:09.520 --> 25:11.840
[footsteps receding]

25:13.000 --> 25:15.040
Aethelred has soured this place.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.400
Then leave.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.560
You do not have to do this.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.800
If we went with you, they would follow
and drag us back in shame.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.480
Then we go further than they can follow.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.120
North, to the edge of the Danelaw.
Ceaster.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.360
The road to Ceaster is too dangerous.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.800
But if we made it, it has Roman walls.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.160
It can be defended.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.120
I want to, Uhtred...

25:47.280 --> 25:49.480
to live in peace by your side...

25:50.960 --> 25:52.960
to raise my daughter in safety.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.640
Nothing would bring me greater happiness.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
But if we left, we could never return.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.760
We cannot let them destroy
all we have fought for.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.240
[clatter of hammering]

26:16.320 --> 26:18.160
[indistinct chattering]

26:25.960 --> 26:29.120
This is a generous gesture, Lord King.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
I know I speak for the people of Mercia

26:31.280 --> 26:34.520
when I say we are grateful
for your men’s labor.

26:34.600 --> 26:38.440
Come on, men! Let our friends
from Wessex see our strength!

26:38.520 --> 26:40.680
[man] Ladies of Wessex, don't pout.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.320
Is this intended as a slight?

26:43.480 --> 26:44.800
Oh, no, Lord King.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.640
He merely strives to redeem
his family name

26:47.720 --> 26:49.080
and I, for one, look on it kindly.

26:49.360 --> 26:53.160
His father lost his lands
in very undignified circumstances.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.200
He merely has the drive
of one tainted by disgrace.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.840
Eardwulf?

27:01.720 --> 27:04.360
I believe you pulled me to safety
during the battle.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.880
Yes, Lord King, I did,
something I’d do for any warrior.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.120
Tell me, how are the Mercian Guard
minded on the succession

27:12.200 --> 27:13.920
should your Lord depart this life?

27:15.160 --> 27:16.480
We have no view on it.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.960
They’re loyal to the leader of Mercia,
whoever that is.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.480
They have little time for politics, but...

27:23.560 --> 27:26.360
They’re good men
who respond to strong leadership.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.320
Well, I thank you for your honesty
and your action on the battlefield.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.080
Lord King!

27:38.360 --> 27:41.520
On behalf of my people, I demand that
you remove your troops from Aegelesburg.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.760
I will not abandon Mercia,
when she is in need.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.480
It’s clearly a provocative show
of strength!

27:49.960 --> 27:52.320
I know that you are a man in grief,

27:52.400 --> 27:55.960
but may I suggest you remove yourself
from the King's presence?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.040
Gladly.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.360
I’ve had my fill of Wessex.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.720
There are ways to make men
Lord of Mercia without the Witan.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.560
You seek to control us...

28:16.200 --> 28:17.480
and I will use them.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.920
I fear these are not vacant threats.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.640
Burgred will do something foolish
to place his son on the throne.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.600
Has he not lost one child already?

28:32.920 --> 28:35.280
Aethelred is fading, Lord.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.040
Time is pressing.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.680
-What do you make of Ludeca?
-He cares deeply for peace, which is good.

28:46.760 --> 28:51.080
But he also cares deeply for Mercia,
which may lead us into conflict in time.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.520
He seems a man of piety and reason.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.600
But how old will he be when Aelfwynn
is of age to produce an heir?

28:59.600 --> 29:03.560
He is not much older than I am
and I am still active in the field.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.600
Aethelflaed will not like it.

29:05.680 --> 29:10.160
With respect, your sister
needs to start doing as she’s told.

29:12.160 --> 29:16.040
That man Eardwulf,
he seems respected by his warriors.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.400
He is younger and we know him to be brave.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.840
But he’s not an Ealdorman.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.080
Find out what you can about him.

29:24.160 --> 29:28.200
[men shouting]

29:39.560 --> 29:41.200
Do not ask me!

29:42.240 --> 29:43.560
What is Edward planning?

29:43.640 --> 29:46.000
I do not know,
and I’ve had enough of politics!

29:47.160 --> 29:51.280
You got in trouble for raising the Welsh?
You did what was needed.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.600
Did I? Hundreds dead, Mercia in turmoil!

29:54.680 --> 29:58.360
-It turned the tide against the Danes.
-And led to new chaos and new divisions!

29:58.440 --> 30:02.400
Look how the people turn on each other.
This is what happens when kings weaken.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.120
The lines of command are broken
and the people on the streets suffer.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.960
Nonetheless, I need you to find out what
Edward is planning to do with his troops.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.520
No. I’m a man who speaks the truth,
or at my worst, a man who uses his fists.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.960
I was not built for spying and betrayal!

30:16.040 --> 30:17.560
[sighs] I’ll leave you.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.360
Beocca warned me.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.320
He said I might have to choose
between my conscience and my King.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.560
But what if it was a message
to be steadfast that I ignored,

30:29.640 --> 30:31.080
seeking my own glory?

30:33.200 --> 30:34.800
[inhales]

30:34.880 --> 30:36.480
Beocca saw things...

30:37.680 --> 30:39.680
more clearly than the rest of us.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.960
He knew what was coming.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.920
[inhales and exhales slowly]

30:45.000 --> 30:47.120
And he knew that you would choose wisely.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.760
[grunting and snoring]

31:20.720 --> 31:22.480
Where are you taking these women?

31:25.120 --> 31:28.080
On a pilgrimage
to the shrine of Saint Wite.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.600
We will give thanks for our great victory.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.720
You shall not leave the town.
An order has come from Aegelesburg.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.320
You are to be confined as a punishment

31:36.400 --> 31:38.560
for raising an army
without the King's consent.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.760
And when was this confinement decided?

31:42.840 --> 31:45.240
I've been asked to enact
the will of the King.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.720
Have Lady Aelswith guarded
in the Reading Room.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.480
[women mutter and gasp]

31:51.200 --> 31:52.360
Do as Cenric orders!

31:53.800 --> 31:55.400
Ignore this girl!

31:57.840 --> 32:00.360
She speaks without authority.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.600
-Look how she trembles!
-Do you defy the will of the King?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.400
You are not the King.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.480
No, but I am anointed Queen.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.360
And in Edward's absence,
my will takes precedence.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.520
I will not fight against it.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.960
I simply ask that a soldier bring
a prayer book to my room,

32:27.040 --> 32:28.840
so that I may reflect.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.680
[Ludeca] It will be resolved
with a little will on all sides. [laughs]

32:41.680 --> 32:42.800
Some wine...

32:46.120 --> 32:49.880
He is honest and good-natured,
but I am troubled by his age.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.440
Should I offer Ludeca my niece...

32:55.040 --> 32:59.080
as a dowry in return
for a renewal of the alliance?

32:59.640 --> 33:02.800
That is, of course, your decision,

33:02.880 --> 33:06.400
but I would follow your instincts.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.920
Look to the hero of the battle.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.680
No more trouble in the taverns, I hope.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.480
We will send men to water down the ale,
Lord King.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.480
Lord Aethelhelm asked me
to join you at the table.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.120
I did indeed, welcome.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.600
Continue.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.880
The Mercian Guard is loyal to him.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.760
It would bring the fighting force
under your command.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.440
As you know, he’s keen to restore his name

33:34.520 --> 33:37.040
and he served Aethelred
with complete loyalty.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.040
They even called him The Arse-licker.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.480
I do not want an arse-licker.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.400
I want a man
who will serve all of our interests.

33:46.800 --> 33:52.280
Yes, someone who will work with us
to achieve the peace you need.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.320
But the choice is yours.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.800
Is there more trouble in the town?

33:58.880 --> 34:00.360
Does Burgred gather men?

34:00.960 --> 34:01.800
No.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.680
No, the King just asked I sit beside you.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.440
It’s a sign that he wishes to propose
to the Ealdormen and the Mercian Guard

34:11.520 --> 34:13.199
that I should be the successor.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.040
Do I have your loyalty?

34:22.280 --> 34:24.000
The Guard are loyal to the leader
of Mercia.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.000
Good.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.520
Then finally order will be restored.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.760
[Aethelred breathes heavily]

34:39.719 --> 34:42.199
[softly] Thank you for staying by my side.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.800
Your wife has commanded it.

34:45.679 --> 34:48.920
They all wish me dead, do they not?

34:51.560 --> 34:55.320
Why? Did I do something
to offend my people?

34:59.960 --> 35:03.560
All of you, leave me alone... with...

35:05.960 --> 35:07.080
with Eadith.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.240
I remembered your name.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.640
Were we in love?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.040
Though I know I regret
to see you suffer...

35:29.600 --> 35:32.000
I could not in truth say that I loved you.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.640
If I mistreated you, then I am sorry.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.760
Women are used to being mistreated.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.480
We are taught to endure it.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.080
Will you survive without me?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.560
I do not know.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.840
I have survived a great deal.

35:58.880 --> 36:04.400
Tell me the truth. Am I to die?

36:11.320 --> 36:14.240
Prayers are being said for you, yes.

36:15.560 --> 36:20.200
The rumor is that your mind fails
and you will die, Lord.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.480
Then I need a miracle.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.080
And it’s not clear that I am owed one.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.640
You could try praying on the relics
of our beloved Saint.

36:33.240 --> 36:37.040
For all your mistakes in Mercia,
gathering his bones was not one of them.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.760
They’re in the treasury.
Ask for them to be brought to me.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.280
I will fetch them.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.080
Perhaps they will bring you to yourself.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.120
Or just a scrap of luck.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.520
I fear that I have much to account for.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.440
This reminds me
of when I drank with your father last.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.240
He had just secured victory
at the battle of Ethandun.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.800
The feasting was magnificent.

37:09.880 --> 37:13.560
My father always felt our two lands
thrived when we broke bread together.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.320
Exactly, the unity between us is critical,

37:16.400 --> 37:19.800
both countries, side by side,
equal like brothers.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.280
But with deference to King Edward.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.760
With mutual respect, yes.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.400
We should discuss this unity.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.920
And the betrothal of my niece.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.240
It seems wise to secure one
with the other...

37:38.880 --> 37:41.280
subject, of course,
to the approval of the Ealdormen.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.600
The Ealdormen will do my bidding.
I have them under my control.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.440
Hm.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.560
Well, as you know,
Lady Aelfwynn is dear to me.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.880
I should like her to be betrothed
to a man I trust.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.280
I agree that seems preferable. Her youth
means that she could be fertile for years.

37:58.000 --> 37:58.840
[glass thuds]

37:59.400 --> 38:01.360
[footsteps leaving]

38:01.440 --> 38:02.400
Yes.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.040
Well, obviously, we want a man
with standing in all parts of Mercia,

38:07.120 --> 38:08.720
someone we might see as a...

38:08.800 --> 38:10.840
I think the phrase
you’re searching for is peacemaker.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.600
Someone who can unite the divisions
in Mercia.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.360
Indeed.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.440
A peacemaker for times of peace.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.920
Could you be such a man, Eardwulf?

38:29.960 --> 38:31.760
Eardwulf is not an Ealdorman.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.520
His family was disgraced.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.800
Well, disgrace can be reversed
by royal decree.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.720
If you agree, all we would need
would be the approval of a Witan.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.560
And the Ealdormen will do your bidding,
will they not?

38:47.640 --> 38:50.000
Unless they feel that I am being cheated.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.560
[Edward] But you would not be.

38:51.640 --> 38:56.480
Because if Eardwulf takes the title,
the land he is owed becomes vacant.

38:57.280 --> 39:02.120
And those could be handed to you
in exchange for your generous support.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.720
To the peacemaker.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.440
Peacemaker.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.600
To the peacemaker.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.560
[footsteps approaching]

39:32.960 --> 39:36.360
Lord, I come with news
that will revive you.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.760
[sighs]

39:42.800 --> 39:44.840
Has a successor been chosen?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.960
The King wishes to betroth me
to your daughter.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.320
No.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.480
I will not agree to it.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.760
But her hand with mine will unite
the two kingdoms

39:59.840 --> 40:02.200
and I will be the peacemaker
who saves Mercia.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.120
I promised my wife
I would not act without her.

40:09.120 --> 40:13.400
Without a plan, King Edward will take
your throne and Mercia will be subsumed.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.840
Please, Lord, just trust that I have
Mercia's best interests at heart.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.080
I’m begging you.
Have I not always served you well?

40:25.360 --> 40:28.240
[breathes heavily]

40:28.320 --> 40:29.320
No.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.680
No, you do not.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.680
I cannot place it,
but my stomach tells me that you lie.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.880
Lord...

40:45.240 --> 40:47.360
I have never lied to you.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.680
[grunts]

40:54.760 --> 40:57.160
[gasps]

40:58.040 --> 41:00.040
You have a stench about you.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.760
[breathes heavily]

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
You are not worthy of my daughter.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.200
[strained] You will never rule Mercia.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.480
[breathes heavily]

41:13.440 --> 41:14.600
[grunts]

41:17.240 --> 41:18.320
Get out.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.600
Leave me.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.760
[hoarse and softly] Guards, help!

41:32.840 --> 41:34.320
[gasping]

41:34.400 --> 41:35.240
[softly] Help...

41:37.200 --> 41:38.040
Hel...

41:42.280 --> 41:43.760
[yelps and groans]

41:48.520 --> 41:49.680
[grunts and groans]

42:04.240 --> 42:05.680
[neck snaps]

42:06.640 --> 42:13.640
[Eardwulf pants]

42:20.560 --> 42:23.600
You did not hear it from me.
I merely left the feast to take a piss.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.120
And if I am asked, I will deny it.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.560
Of course, Pyrlig,
I will not mention your name,

42:27.640 --> 42:31.000
but enough talking in corners,
I’ll simply confront him with it...

42:32.000 --> 42:36.280
Edward, tell me there is a mistake
that you have not broken our agreement

42:36.360 --> 42:38.160
and betrothed my daughter
without my knowledge.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.600
We are simply making plans
should the worst happen.

42:40.680 --> 42:43.640
You agreed Aelfwynn should not be used
as a bargaining piece.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.640
That was before King Edward
struck a bargain.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.160
Ludeca, you cannot be joined to Aelfwynn.
She’s a child.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.560
I’m not the suitor. I’m merely someone
trying to prevent chaos.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.840
So, who have you betrothed my daughter to?

43:35.200 --> 43:37.240
[Aethelflaed] Edward, you swore
you'd not betroth her

43:37.320 --> 43:38.360
to a man I despised.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.320
He is a great warrior.
He is a leader of men.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.120
Aethelred still rules here,
and he will not allow this.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.560
I cannot wake him.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.120
I had looked to this moment
for many years.

44:06.040 --> 44:09.560
And now it is here,
why do I feel as if I want to cry?

44:10.320 --> 44:13.880
I think he regretted the pain
he caused you, Lady.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.800
Lord have mercy on his soul and on us all.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.760
Prepare the body

44:21.840 --> 44:25.360
and inform your brother that his betrothal
will take place imminently.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.120
You are to be sister
to the new Lord of Mercia.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.760
-[Aethelflaed] Edward, I will fight this!
-You will not.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.040
You agreed that Aelfwynn's
betrothal was best for Mercia--

44:36.120 --> 44:39.040
I will not have my child condemned
to a life of misery.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.600
-Please, Ludeca, do not accept this plan.
-The plan offers stability.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.880
I believe it to be the best solution.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.440
Eardwulf is not the man to bring peace.
Please.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.080
Lady, begging is unbecoming.

44:54.840 --> 44:57.120
After everything I have done for Mercia...

44:57.760 --> 44:59.840
to have risked my life for this reward,

44:59.920 --> 45:02.280
my child thrown to a man
who will mistreat her?

45:02.360 --> 45:05.640
Perhaps it will teach her more deference
than her mother has.

45:12.920 --> 45:16.080
Ride to Saltwic. Fetch the Lady Aelfwynn.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.920
King Edward would like you
to ensure no force is used.

45:23.760 --> 45:24.800
[horse snorts]

45:24.880 --> 45:27.120
[hooves beating]

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
He is gone.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.840
Aethelred is dead.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.760
Then you are free.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.960
He can torment you no longer.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.040
I wish that were true.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.000
But they seem to be set on destroying me
and all that matters.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.880
I thought Aethelred’s death would be
a chance for me to live in peace...

45:59.760 --> 46:01.400
after all this time.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.440
But they cast me aside...

46:05.320 --> 46:07.520
treat my child as a bag of silver.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.000
I will bargain a way out of this...
somehow I will.

46:11.080 --> 46:14.400
We do not need negotiation.
We must alert our allies,

46:14.480 --> 46:16.560
rally them against Eardwulf, if necessary.

46:16.640 --> 46:20.320
It would set the Mercian Fyrd against
the Wessex army. It would be a civil war.

46:20.920 --> 46:24.600
A group of riders have just been sent
by Lord Aethelhelm to Saltwic.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.000
They are to take Aelfwynn.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.960
Edward is not himself.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.600
I will speak with him again.

46:33.080 --> 46:35.960
Go to Ceaster.
Take her somewhere you can protect her.

46:40.160 --> 46:44.640
Lord, I’ve heard the terrible news.
I will inform the people of the tragedy.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.560
Our traditions will unite us in grief.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.960
May it bring a time of healing for Mercia.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.200
I fear my sister will not mourn him.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.560
With respect, Lord King,
your sister should follow the custom.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.480
She loves Mercia,
but she never loved its leader.

47:05.240 --> 47:08.160
Have Aethelflaed confined
until all this is settled.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.760
If only to save her offending
the Ealdormen by her lack of grief.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.760
-I do not wish to be confined.
-It’s a chance to mourn.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.200
May I suggest you make this simple
and comply?

47:45.280 --> 47:46.120
[door slams]

47:57.920 --> 47:58.760
Lady Aelswith...

48:00.640 --> 48:03.280
Good, a man I trust.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.560
Follow my next instructions...

48:07.040 --> 48:09.280
and I am sure you will be well rewarded.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.720
[birds chirping]

48:36.120 --> 48:36.960
[chuckles]

48:44.680 --> 48:46.040
[chomps and chuckles]

48:46.120 --> 48:47.600
-[chicks chirp]
-Dip-dip.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.440
[Stiorra] Was Bebbanburg as impressive
as we were told as children?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.160
It was more so...

48:53.760 --> 48:55.000
and harder to attack.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.800
Do you think we’ll ever return to it,
or is it lost forever?

48:58.880 --> 49:01.440
I don’t think I will see it again
in my lifetime.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
Perhaps our children will reclaim it.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.480
I do not want children.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.440
I’m tired of their company.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.120
[horses neighing]

49:17.880 --> 49:20.280
Aelfwynn, come in... now!

49:22.200 --> 49:23.320
Aethelstan...

49:26.080 --> 49:27.440
Men are riding this way.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.280
-Which men?
-I don’t know, but they’re coming.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
Wait!

49:34.400 --> 49:35.360
We have a plan.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.800
Oh? Can I help you? Are you lost?

49:42.880 --> 49:45.320
We’re taking Lady Aelfwynn to Aegelesburg.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
She’s already been taken to Winchester.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.400
Who by?

49:50.480 --> 49:53.000
Erm, I think he called himself Uhtred.

49:54.440 --> 49:55.400
Let us in!

49:57.800 --> 49:59.400
You two, search the grounds.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.840
The rest of you with me.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.800
Nothing here.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.280
Off!

50:46.400 --> 50:47.320
I told you...

50:47.960 --> 50:49.040
she’s not here.

50:50.680 --> 50:51.640
Let’s go!

50:52.920 --> 50:54.280
[sighs]

51:09.320 --> 51:10.480
Stiorra!

51:11.000 --> 51:11.880
Stiorra?

51:12.920 --> 51:15.120
Stiorra! It is your father!

51:17.560 --> 51:19.760
-Did they hurt you?
-No, it worked.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.440
-I sent them away.
-Good.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.120
Sihtric!

51:24.200 --> 51:25.240
I told you.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.880
-We prepared ourselves for an invasion.
-[chuckles] Lord!

51:28.480 --> 51:29.320
Is it over?

51:29.400 --> 51:31.680
-Hey, little trickster you got here.
-[Stiorra laughs]

51:31.760 --> 51:32.720
Where’s Aelfwynn?

51:40.400 --> 51:41.240
[whistles]

51:50.640 --> 51:53.280
Death came for mother faster
than she could ever know.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.400
I’ve always felt it would come for me,
at speed, from nowhere.

51:57.120 --> 52:00.280
When I saw the horses, Father,
I was prepared, but I wasn’t afraid.

52:00.760 --> 52:05.320
Besides, I had faith you’d come for me.
And I was right.

52:05.400 --> 52:08.760
[footsteps approaching]

52:12.560 --> 52:15.480
Bread, water and weapons,
the rest we’ll find on the road.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.480
Stiorra, get the children on the cart!

52:17.560 --> 52:18.720
We head north towards Ceaster.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.200
Do you think we have enough?

52:20.280 --> 52:22.080
With children and a band of five?

52:22.160 --> 52:25.320
It’s only until Aethelflaed
secures agreement from her brother.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.080
All will be made right.

52:36.800 --> 52:37.840
[door opens]

52:39.400 --> 52:42.760
Come. I have alerted the man
who protects you. He’s outside the window.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.560
If you think I will fall into a trap,
you are mistaken.

52:45.640 --> 52:49.080
-Please, Lady, I am trying to help you.
-Why would a mistress help a wife?

52:49.160 --> 52:52.560
Because Mercia has wronged us both
and our brothers have turned on us.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.280
Lady, we are not so different.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.360
I have never humped a man for influence.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.480
Just for your country
and political alliance.

52:58.960 --> 53:02.480
I never humped Aethelred willingly
and, believe me, I am paying for it. Go.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.760
I have nothing and no one. You have silver
and men that will help you.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.160
[grunts]

53:09.800 --> 53:10.920
Use them.

53:12.680 --> 53:13.760
Lady.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.920
-Will Eardwulf not kill you for this?
-He will try but he will not succeed.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.240
Go, Lady.

53:19.920 --> 53:23.320
My brother cannot be controlled
and will bring nothing but disaster.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.280
Find Uhtred on the road to Ceaster.

53:28.160 --> 53:30.960
Tell him to meet me at the ruins
of Saint Milburg's Priory.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.600
Do this and I will ensure
you never go penniless.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.040
[grunts]

53:50.840 --> 53:53.560
Aldhelm, do I really abandon Mercia
after everything?

53:53.640 --> 53:56.400
Lady, Mercia has abandoned you.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.680
-[Aethelflaed sighs]
-Go.
