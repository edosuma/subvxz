00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.500


01:19.208 --> 01:22.000
Zombies are not as scary
as I thought they'd be.

01:22.083 --> 01:26.208
I'm proud of ya. You only needed
to change your pants three times.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.041
A new record.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.625
Oh! It's late.
To make it home before dark,

01:30.708 --> 01:33.166
we better take a shortcut
through the creepy cemetery.

01:36.875 --> 01:40.791
Nothing scary about that.
Not to a record-breaker like me.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.500
Attaboy, Mugsy.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.666
Hm…

01:53.916 --> 01:56.000
Sure is a lot of tombstones.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.500
Uh-huh.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.958
Really starting to get dark now.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.583
Some might find that unsettling,
but not me.

02:11.666 --> 02:13.125
Good thing we're so brave.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.375
I can't think of a time
I've been less scared.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.750
-Nothing scary about a graveyard.
-Just a yard.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.541
-For playing.
-We have a yard.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.291
-We should vacation here.
-Live here!

02:21.375 --> 02:22.333
I never wanna leave!

02:27.416 --> 02:30.541
Well, I know what we're doing tonight.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.583
Things just got a lot more interesting.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.500
Go fish!

02:39.666 --> 02:40.500
Huh?

02:45.166 --> 02:48.166
Did you see that?
It slammed shut outta nowhere!

02:48.250 --> 02:52.083
Okay. Let's get a grip on ourselves.
That was probably the wind.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.250
Wind? What wind?
I didn't feel any wind. No wind.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.041
Oh, no, no, no! It won't budge!

02:58.125 --> 03:00.041
We're trapped!

03:01.291 --> 03:03.916
Relax. It just needs
a little elbow grease.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.250


03:07.916 --> 03:09.458
Hm, stuck pretty good.

03:09.541 --> 03:11.333
What are we gonna do?!

03:11.416 --> 03:14.000
First, we're gonna calm down.

03:14.083 --> 03:17.541
But what about g-g-ghosts?

03:17.625 --> 03:20.666
Ah, banana oil! Ghosts ain't real!

03:22.916 --> 03:25.250
You hear that? We ain't real.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.083
We ain't?

03:29.041 --> 03:29.875
Shh!

03:30.875 --> 03:34.000
Looks like we're stuck. Eh.
Someone will open it in the morning.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.875
Till then, we'll spend the night
and make the best of it.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.625
S-s-spend the night?
But what about the ghosts?

03:41.375 --> 03:45.083
I don't like this, Cuphead.
I'm allergic to dead people.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.708
For the last time, Mugsy.
Ghosts ain't real!

03:48.791 --> 03:52.041
Now you clear a spot,
and I'm gonna get some firewood.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.583
We're separating?

03:53.666 --> 03:57.166
Well, do <i>you</i> wanna come with me
into the deep, dark woods?

04:00.041 --> 04:02.750
Is there a third, less terrifying option?

04:02.833 --> 04:06.416
Look, don't worry.
It'll be just like the movie.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.166
You think you're gonna be scared,
but then it won't be so bad.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.750
'Cause why?

04:11.833 --> 04:13.875
'Cause I'm a big, strong man?

04:14.375 --> 04:15.958
Well, sure.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.958
But also because ghosts ain't real.

04:20.916 --> 04:24.125
They better not be.
I'm all outta spare pants.

04:24.208 --> 04:27.541
Just relax.
I'll be back before you know it.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.666
That was an owl.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.333
Typical Mugman.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.541
Always getting himself
worked up over nothing.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.541
What was that?

04:54.041 --> 04:55.208
Ooh!

04:55.708 --> 04:56.541
Who's there?

04:57.208 --> 04:58.458


04:58.541 --> 04:59.375
Whoa!

05:00.791 --> 05:01.833


05:03.625 --> 05:04.458
Huh?

05:05.208 --> 05:06.041
Hello.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.583
Fireflies.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.958
Cuphead was right. Ghosts ain't real.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.958
You know,
it's actually kinda peaceful out here.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.583
Just the sounds
of the wind, the owl, the--

05:45.666 --> 05:47.875
<i>Disembodied voice behind you.</i>

05:49.583 --> 05:51.208
Real cute, Cuphead.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.916
Ha, ha, ha. Hilarious.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.375
I know you're trying to scare me,
but I'm not falling for your--

05:59.083 --> 06:00.125
…tricks.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.208
Not funny, Cuphead.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.708
I thought it was right funny.
But I ain't never heard of no Cuphead.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.291
Top of the evening, love.

06:18.666 --> 06:20.625
Cuphead! Cuphead!

06:20.708 --> 06:22.708
Cuphead!

06:27.208 --> 06:29.708
I don't wanna alarm you,
but I think I saw a--

06:29.791 --> 06:30.958
Ghosts!

07:04.750 --> 07:06.708


07:06.791 --> 07:09.041


07:39.458 --> 07:43.458
I know it's scary, Mugsy,
but you gotta stop chattering your teeth.

07:43.541 --> 07:45.666
My teeth aren't chattering.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.375
A-ha!

08:50.791 --> 08:51.625
Whoa!

08:52.333 --> 08:54.041
We gotta find a way out!

08:54.125 --> 08:55.541
Here's the way out.

08:58.291 --> 08:59.916
Here. Try this one.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.541
Over here. Over here.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.875
-Here. Here. Here.
-No! No! No!

09:16.958 --> 09:18.416
No more doors!

09:29.583 --> 09:30.958
Now do you believe in--

09:37.375 --> 09:38.916
Boo!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.291
-Oof!
-Knock it off.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.000
We got a real problem here.

09:48.125 --> 09:52.458
One minute, we're all having fun.
The next minute, two cups are dead.

09:52.541 --> 09:55.041
Oh, them poor little cups.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.833
Shall we say a few words then?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.083
Huh?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.375
They're gone!

10:03.750 --> 10:05.125
Come on!

10:11.250 --> 10:13.708
-We made it.
-Safe at last.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.291
Phew!

10:17.125 --> 10:19.583
Hideous zombies!

10:22.208 --> 10:27.041
Die, zombie, die!
