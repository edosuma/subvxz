00:49.148 --> 00:49.780
Hey Terrance,

00:49.782 --> 00:51.549
looks like this
might be a good place

00:51.551 --> 00:52.650
to start a new colony.

00:52.652 --> 00:53.684
It sure does
Phillip.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.820
No one will repress
our religion here.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.255
( farting )

00:59.225 --> 01:01.359
You stained my
pilgrim hat,
butt pipe!

01:01.361 --> 01:02.927
DID YOU GUYS
SEE THAT?

01:02.929 --> 01:03.828
THAT WAS SWEET.

01:03.830 --> 01:04.462
Coming up next on

01:04.464 --> 01:06.097
"The Terrance and Phillip
Thanksgiving Special",

01:06.099 --> 01:08.399
Phillip farts on
Terrance and laughs.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.000
OH COOL!

01:09.002 --> 01:10.735
And now a word
from our sponsor--

01:10.737 --> 01:12.270
Here in the heart
of Africa

01:12.272 --> 01:13.237
children are dying.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.840
Not from disease or war
but from hunger.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.041
I'm<i> Sally Struthers.</i>

01:17.043 --> 01:19.877
These children are
in desperate need...

01:19.879 --> 01:21.479
HEY, WHO'S
THAT FAT CHICK?

01:21.481 --> 01:22.713
SALLY STRUTHERS DUDE,

01:22.715 --> 01:24.315
SHE USED TO BE
ON "FULL HOUSE".

01:24.317 --> 01:24.749
OH.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.851
You see, here in
the middle of Africa,

01:26.853 --> 01:28.219
food is extremely
scarce.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.521
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SHE'S
HAVING ANY TROUBLE

01:30.523 --> 01:31.122
FINDING FOOD.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.790
YEAH, SHE'S FATTER
THAN CARTMAN.

01:32.792 --> 01:33.691
YEAH... HEY!

01:33.693 --> 01:37.261
For just $5 a month
you can sponsor a child.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.029
THAT'S STUPID,

01:38.031 --> 01:39.363
WHO THE HELL WOULD
WANT TO DO THAT?

01:39.365 --> 01:41.332

02:14.100 --> 02:16.600
DO WE GET THE SPORTS

02:16.602 --> 02:17.635

02:18.304 --> 02:20.805
I GET TO WEAR IT
FIRST YOU GUYS.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.107
I CAN'T WAIT TO
GET OUT OF SCHOOL

02:23.109 --> 02:24.275
AND GET OUR TEIKO
SPORTS WATCH.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.610
YEAH, BUT I GET TO WEAR
IT FIRST, I SAID IT.

02:26.612 --> 02:27.645
CHILDREN,
CHILDREN...

02:27.647 --> 02:29.880
TO HONOR THIS SPECIAL
TIME OF YEAR,

02:29.882 --> 02:31.615
WE'LL BE DOING
A CANNED FOOD DRIVE.

02:31.617 --> 02:34.985
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT
A CANNED FOOD DRIVE IS?

02:34.987 --> 02:35.486
YES ERIC.

02:35.488 --> 02:39.724
WHEN THEY CUT UP A CHICK'S
STOMACH TO GET A BABY OUT.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.560
NO THAT'S A CESAREAN
SECTION ERIC,

02:42.562 --> 02:43.194
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.062
REMEMBER, THERE ARE
NO STUPID QUESTIONS,

02:45.064 --> 02:45.930
JUST STUPID PEOPLE.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.199
A CANNED FOOD DRIVE IS WHEN
WE COLLECT CANNED FOOD

02:48.201 --> 02:50.701
FOR POOR PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO EAT

02:50.703 --> 02:51.335
ON THANKSGIVING.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.937
YOU MEAN LIKE
KENNY?

02:52.939 --> 02:53.871
EXACTLY.

02:53.873 --> 02:54.505
MR. GARRISON,

02:54.507 --> 02:57.274
WHY DO POOR PEOPLE ALWAYS
SMELL LIKE SOUR MILK?

02:57.276 --> 03:00.111
I DON'T KNOW ERIC,
THEY JUST DO.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.445
NOW CHILDREN,

03:01.447 --> 03:03.881
I WANT EACH OF YOU
TO BRING IN ONE CAN OF FOOD,

03:03.883 --> 03:05.583
AND LATER, THE MAYOR
OF SOUTH PARK

03:05.585 --> 03:07.918
WILL DIVIDE IT UP
AMONGST KENNY'S FAMILY

03:07.920 --> 03:08.853
AND OTHER
POOR PEOPLE.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.988
I'M NOT BRINGING
IN FOOD, SCREW THEM!

03:10.990 --> 03:13.924
DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP THOSE
WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE?

03:13.926 --> 03:15.760
HEY YOU GUYS, DO YOU
HEAR SOMETHING?

03:15.762 --> 03:18.562
I THINK I HEAR THE
FLOWER CHILDREN CALLING.

03:18.564 --> 03:19.897
THIS IS THE ONE
TIME OF YEAR

03:19.899 --> 03:22.833
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EAT.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.835
ISN'T IT ENOUGH
THAT I PAY TAXES?

03:24.837 --> 03:27.037
WHAT ABOUT THE POOR
HOUSES THAT I PAY FOR?

03:27.039 --> 03:30.508
MANY WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN GO TO THOSE PLACES.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.776
WELL THEN PERHAPS
THEY SHOULD

03:31.778 --> 03:34.044
AND DECREASE THE
SURPLUS POPULATION.

03:34.046 --> 03:34.745
OKAY KIDS,

03:34.747 --> 03:36.113
THAT'S ENOUGH
DICKENS FOR ONE DAY

03:36.115 --> 03:38.382
LET'S GET ON WITH OUR
LESSON, RIGHT MR. HAT?

03:38.384 --> 03:39.350
THAT'S RIGHT
MR. GARRISON.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.953
<i>ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK</i> WAS
THE FIRST PERSON ON THE MOON.

03:42.955 --> 03:45.055
WHO WAS THE SECOND?

03:47.527 --> 03:48.526
AHH!

03:48.528 --> 03:51.061
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

04:00.273 --> 04:02.773
WELL, YOU DON'T SEE
THAT EVERY DAY.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.242
OKAY, NOW,

04:05.244 --> 04:07.511
ONCE WE HAVE ALL THE
CANNED FOODS COLLECTED,

04:07.513 --> 04:08.913
WE'LL NEED SOME
CLEVER WAY

04:08.915 --> 04:10.514
TO DISTRIBUTE
THEM TO THE POOR.

04:10.516 --> 04:11.982
IT SHOULD BE
SOMETHING FESTIVE.

04:11.984 --> 04:15.286
MAYOR, WE'VE GOT A
VERY BIG PROBLEM.

04:15.288 --> 04:18.022
YOU'RE THAT INSANE
GENETIC ENGINEER

04:18.024 --> 04:18.989
FROM UP ON
THE HILL, RIGHT?

04:18.991 --> 04:21.759
YES, AND I MAY HAVE MADE
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.828
I WAS TRYING TO
GENETICALLY ENGINEER

04:23.830 --> 04:25.262
TURKEYS FOR
THANKSGIVING.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.030
UH-HUH.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.998
YOU KNOW, TO PROVIDE
FOOD FOR THE NEEDY.

04:28.000 --> 04:28.499
OF COURSE.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.702
WELL, SOMETHING WENT WRONG
AND THE TURKEYS BROKE FREE

04:31.704 --> 04:35.973
AND THE WORST PART IS
THEY'RE REALLY PISSED OFF.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.441
NATURALLY.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.144
OH, DO GO ON.

04:40.146 --> 04:41.412
WE HAVE TO
STOP THEM

04:41.414 --> 04:43.380
OR THEY COULD DESTROY
EVERYTHING.

04:43.382 --> 04:45.049
TIME IS SHORT.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.152
YOU WERE SAYING?

04:48.154 --> 04:51.655
THEY ACT JUST LIKE NORMAL
TURKEYS EXCEPT THEY'RE EVIL.

04:51.657 --> 04:53.491
OH, MY.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.460
( honking )

04:56.462 --> 04:59.563
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.099
NOW WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

05:03.903 --> 05:05.436
DID IT COME,
DID IT COME?

05:05.438 --> 05:06.403
IS IT HERE YET?

05:06.405 --> 05:07.638
I GET TO USE IT
FIRST YOU GUYS.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.442
MOM, DID OUR DIGITAL
SPORTS WATCH COME YET.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.377

05:14.380 --> 05:15.112
HEY, LOOK YOU GUYS.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.647
And now back
to part two of

05:16.649 --> 05:19.083
"The Terrance and Phillip
Thanksgiving Special."

05:19.085 --> 05:21.118
I sure am
cold, Phillip.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.920
Yes and
hungry too.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.122
Being a pilgrim
totally sucks ass.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.458
Gosh, I hope
we don't starve.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.260
( farting )

05:29.262 --> 05:30.995
Oh,<i> squiggle</i>!

05:32.231 --> 05:34.498

05:34.867 --> 05:37.535
THE DIGITAL SPORTS
WATCH IS HERE!

05:42.008 --> 05:43.073
WHAT THE HELL?

05:43.075 --> 05:45.376
DUDE, THAT'S NOT A
DIGITAL SPORTS WATCH.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.445
HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE ONE
OF THOSE<i> ETHERNOPIANS.</i>

05:48.447 --> 05:49.013
OH MAN,

05:49.015 --> 05:50.514
THEY MUST HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY
SENT HIM

05:50.516 --> 05:51.715
INSTEAD OF
THE SPORTS WATCH.

05:51.717 --> 05:52.983
MAYBE THEY
TOOK IT
LITERALLY

05:52.985 --> 05:54.985
WHEN WE SAID WE
WANTED TO ADOPT A KID.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.654
( clicking noises )

05:56.656 --> 05:57.888
WHOA, THAT
WAS COOL.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.124
HOW'D HE MAKE THOSE
CLICKING SOUNDS?

06:00.126 --> 06:01.892
WHAT'S YOUR
NAME, DUDE?

06:01.894 --> 06:02.426
...MARVIN...

06:02.428 --> 06:03.928
I THINK HE SAID
HIS NAME IS MARVIN.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.596
YEAH,
"STARVIN' MARVIN."

06:05.598 --> 06:08.499
NICE TO MEET YOU
STARVIN' MARVIN.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.800
HEY MOM.

06:15.041 --> 06:15.706
SWEET!

06:15.708 --> 06:18.208
DUDE LET'S BRING HIM
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.209
COME ON
STARVIN' MARVIN,

06:19.211 --> 06:20.945
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.680
NO, NO,
HE'S MY SON.

06:22.682 --> 06:23.314
I ADOPTED HIM.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.648
IT WAS MY MOM'S
CREDIT CARD.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.683
OKAY, OKAY,
WE'LL SWITCH OFF.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.585
STARVIN' MARVIN CAN
STAY HERE FOR A WEEK.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.053
THEN AT STAN'S,
THEN WITH ME.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.220
YEAH, AND
NEVER WITH KENNY

06:30.222 --> 06:32.056
'CAUSE HIS FAMILY
IS TOO POOR.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.157
TOTALLY.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.595
LOOK HOW THE LEAVES
FALL SO DELICATELY

06:37.597 --> 06:39.863
ON THE SURFACE
OF THE POND.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.532
IT'S SO
BEAUTIFUL.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.734
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.269
OH...

06:46.606 --> 06:48.539
( howling turkeys )

06:48.741 --> 06:51.675
OH DARLING LOOK,
THANKSGIVING TURKEYS.

06:51.677 --> 06:55.079
OH, THEY'RE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.647
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU.

06:56.649 --> 06:59.383
LOOK AT THE WAY
THEY FOAM AT THE MOUTH

06:59.385 --> 07:02.753
LIKE BEAUTIFUL
SUDS OF BEER.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.755
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS...

07:04.757 --> 07:07.291
AH!
AHH!

07:13.366 --> 07:14.131
THIS IS
A GREAT WAY

07:14.133 --> 07:15.633
FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE
AMERICA, STARVIN' MARVIN.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.568
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL AN
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.170
YEAH, HERE YOU GET
TO EAT ALL YOU WANT

07:20.172 --> 07:21.005
FOR ONLY $6.99.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.374
THAT'S WHY WE ALL COME
HERE ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.408
EXCEPT FOR
KENNY'S FAMILY

07:24.410 --> 07:27.277
'CAUSE TO THEM, $6.99
IS TWO YEARS INCOME.

07:27.913 --> 07:30.180
WHY IS YOUR FAMILY POOR,
STARVIN' MARVIN?

07:30.182 --> 07:32.282
IS YOUR DAD AN
ALCOHOLIC TOO?

07:32.284 --> 07:34.084
YOU SEE
STARVIN' MARVIN,

07:34.086 --> 07:36.920
THESE ARE WHAT
WE CALL APPETIZERS.

07:36.922 --> 07:38.255
AP-PE-TIZER.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.357
THIS IS WHAT YOU EAT
BEFORE YOU EAT

07:40.359 --> 07:42.860
TO MAKE YOU
MORE HUNGRY.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.261
UH, FOODS HERE.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.630
THAT'S IT FOR
THE APPETIZERS.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.870
NO STARVIN' MARVIN,
THAT'S MY POT PIE.

07:52.872 --> 07:53.804
CARTMAN,
YOU BUTT PIPE.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.906
THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SHARE.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.408
OH YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.710
ARE YOU GONNA EAT ALL
OF YOUR PEACH COBBLER?

07:59.712 --> 08:01.078
NO, YOU DON'T
WANT ALL THAT,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.680
WHY DON'T YOU
SHARE IT WITH ME?

08:02.682 --> 08:04.148
SLIDE THAT
OVER HERE...

08:04.150 --> 08:06.517
LET ME JUST HAVE
SOME OF THAT.

08:08.988 --> 08:09.653
CHILDREN, CHILDREN.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.556
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN
YOUR THANKSGIVING SPIRIT.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.558
ONLY A FEW CANS
HAVE BEEN DONATED

08:14.560 --> 08:15.826
TO OUR CANNED
FOOD DRIVE.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.430
AND CAN'T WE DO A LITTLE
BETTER THAN CREAMED CORN,

08:19.432 --> 08:22.666
CREAMED CORN,
AND CREAMED CORN?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.836
PLEASE BRING IN MORE
DIVERSE FOOD CHILDREN,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.538
OR ELSE KENNY'S FAMILY
IS GONNA HAVE

08:27.540 --> 08:30.741
A PRETTY CORNY
THANKSGIVING.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.313
...CORNY...

08:36.682 --> 08:38.882
...CORNY THANKSGIVING!

08:39.819 --> 08:42.686
ANYWAY, I UNDERSTAND
A FEW OF YOU HAVE

08:42.688 --> 08:44.655
BROUGHT IN
SOMETHING SPECIAL

08:44.657 --> 08:45.756
FOR SHOW AND TELL.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.057
YEAH WE DID.
YEAH.

08:47.059 --> 08:50.160
ALRIGHT BOYS, SHOW US
WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.063
THIS IS OUR
NEW<i> ETHERNOPIAN,</i>

08:53.065 --> 08:54.965
STARVIN' MARVIN.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.267
HE CAN DO REALLY COOL
STUFF WITH HIS VOICE.

08:57.269 --> 08:58.535
SHOW THEM,
STARVIN' MARVIN.

08:58.537 --> 09:02.573
NO, STARVIN' MARVIN,
THAT'S KENNY'S
CREAMED CORN.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.273
NO STARVIN' MARVIN!

09:03.275 --> 09:04.742
THAT'S A BAD
STARVIN' MARVIN!

09:04.744 --> 09:06.677
BOYS, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

09:06.679 --> 09:08.612
THIS IS HORRIBLY,
HORRIBLY WRONG.

09:08.614 --> 09:09.913
HOW DID YOU
GET THIS CHILD?

09:09.915 --> 09:11.782
HE WAS ACCIDENTALLY
DELIVERED TO US

09:11.784 --> 09:12.783
INSTEAD OF A
SPORTS WATCH.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.785
THE SPORTS WATCH
FROM THE COMMERCIAL?

09:14.787 --> 09:15.753
YEAH, THAT ONE.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.254
I WANT A
STARVIN' MARVIN!

09:17.256 --> 09:17.755
ME TOO!

09:17.757 --> 09:19.757
YES, I'LL PAY
$50 FOR ONE.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.657
I WANT ONE!
I WANT ONE!

09:20.659 --> 09:23.026
BOYS, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO TAKE CARE OF A CHILD.

09:23.028 --> 09:25.763
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CALL THE RED CROSS

09:25.765 --> 09:26.663
AND HAVE HIM
RETURNED.

09:26.665 --> 09:29.666
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO SCHOOL.

09:29.668 --> 09:31.568
OKAY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.370
YES, YOU CAN PICK
HIM UP TONIGHT.

09:33.372 --> 09:33.871
BYE NOW.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.706
NOW BOYS, I HOPE YOU'VE
LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.840
NO.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.375
YOU CAN'T CARE
FOR THIS CHILD.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.310
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO CARE

09:40.312 --> 09:40.944
ON THANKSGIVING.

09:40.946 --> 09:42.813
YES, BUT YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED

09:42.815 --> 09:43.947
WITH THE
CHILD'S LIVES.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.048
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO JUST SEND MONEY

09:45.050 --> 09:47.017
AND ONCE IN A WHILE
THEY WRITE YOU A LETTER.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.619
YOU SEE, MARVIN
DIDN'T GROW UP

09:48.621 --> 09:50.154
IN A NORMAL PLACE
LIKE SOUTH PARK.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.122
SO WHY CAN'T HE
LIVE HERE NOW?

09:52.124 --> 09:53.290
BECAUSE HE CAN'T.

09:53.292 --> 09:53.924
BECAUSE WHY?

09:53.926 --> 09:56.193
BECAUSE EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS
CAN'T BE PARENTS!

09:56.195 --> 09:57.561
THEN YOU TAKE
CARE OF HIM.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.297
I CAN'T, I, UM,
I'M VERY BUSY.

10:00.299 --> 10:04.134
I SEND MY $5.00
A MONTH, SEE?

10:04.136 --> 10:06.403
THIS SUCKS,
STARVIN' MARVIN
IS OUR FRIEND.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.238
WELL, BACK TO THE
POOR COUNTRY WITH YOU.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.007
YOU BETTER WATCH
WHAT YOU SAY CARTMAN,

10:10.009 --> 10:12.042
YOU MIGHT BE POOR
AND HUNGRY SOME DAY.

10:12.044 --> 10:14.311
YEAH RIGHT.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.314
I KNEW YOU WERE
THE ONLY PERSON

10:17.316 --> 10:18.582
WHO WOULD LISTEN
TO ME, CHEF.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.617
YEAH WELL, LET'S
GET IT OVER WITH.

10:20.619 --> 10:23.287
THIS PLACE GIVES ME
THE BOO-BOO-JEEBIES.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.255
LOOK HERE
IN MY MICROSCOPE.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.490
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.927
UMM, I SEE
AN EXTREME CLOSE UP

10:29.929 --> 10:33.397
OF<i> VANESSA REDGRAVE'S</i>
PRIVATE PARTS.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.531
OH, WHOOPS.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.301
NOW TELL ME
WHAT YOU SEE?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.836
WELL, I'M
NO BIOLOGIST

10:38.838 --> 10:41.839
BUT I'D SAY IT
LOOKS LIKE TURKEY DNA.

10:41.841 --> 10:42.673
PRECISELY.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.075
BUT LOOK HOW RAPIDLY
IT'S DIVIDING.

10:45.077 --> 10:45.943
WHAT DOES
IT MEAN?

10:45.945 --> 10:47.845
IT MEANS THE
TURKEYS ARE GROWING

10:47.847 --> 10:49.246
AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.681
IF WE DON'T
DESTROY THEM ALL,

10:50.683 --> 10:52.850
THEY'LL TAKE
OVER THE TOWN,

10:52.852 --> 10:54.218
MAYBE THE WORLD.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.053
OH FUDGE.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.354
UMM...

10:57.356 --> 11:00.290
LET ME SEE THAT
VANESSA REDGRAVE
THING AGAIN.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.092
SURE.

11:06.065 --> 11:06.997
HELLO THERE
LITTLE BOY,

11:06.999 --> 11:09.199
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
THE STARVIN' AFRICAN CHILD

11:09.201 --> 11:10.567
WHO WAS ACCIDENTALLY
SENT HERE

11:10.569 --> 11:13.070
INSTEAD OF A
TEIKO SPORTS WATCH.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.011
( Cartman )
HEY, HEY...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.547
HEY, LET GO OF ME!

11:23.549 --> 11:24.781
HEY!

11:24.783 --> 11:26.617
HERE'S YOUR
SPORTS WATCH SON,

11:26.619 --> 11:28.619
SORRY FOR
THE MIX-UP.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.221
( Cartman yelling )

11:32.691 --> 11:34.458
SWEET.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.496
SO HOW DOES
THIS THING WORK?

11:39.498 --> 11:42.332
WELL IT'S BASED
ON "THE CASH GRAB".

11:42.334 --> 11:43.100
BUT INSTEAD OF MONEY,

11:43.102 --> 11:45.335
THE CANS OF FOOD ARE BLOWN
AROUND INSIDE THE CAPSULE.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.437
THE "POV" INSIDE CATCHES
AS MANY AS HE CAN

11:47.439 --> 11:48.839
TO FEED
HIS FAMILY.

11:48.841 --> 11:49.773
POV?

11:49.775 --> 11:51.508
POVERTY STRICKEN
CITIZEN.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.777
OH, BRILLIANT.

11:57.816 --> 12:00.951
OH, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

12:00.953 --> 12:01.985
I DON'T KNOW MAYOR.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.620
I DON'T THINK IT'S
LISTED ON THE PROGRAM.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.055
THEY'RE INCREASING
IN NUMBER, MAYOR.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.891
THESE ARE THE VICIOUS
TURKEYS I WARNED YOU ABOUT.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.226
IT'S, IT'S
TRUE MAYOR.

12:09.228 --> 12:13.297
THOSE TURKEYS JUST RIPPED
APART MY CAFETERIA.

12:13.299 --> 12:13.964
WHOA!

12:13.966 --> 12:16.667
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS YOU BASTARDS!

12:16.669 --> 12:19.569
WOW, THOSE ARE SOME
PISSED OFF TURKEYS.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.306
OKAY PEOPLE,
DON'T PANIC.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.609
BRING OUT
THE DEFENSE SQUAD!

12:30.382 --> 12:31.782
WE NEED MORE
THAN THAT...

12:31.784 --> 12:34.918
THEY'LL ONLY COME BACK
IN INCREASED NUMBERS.

12:35.988 --> 12:38.956
Hey Phillip, could
you pass the beans?

12:38.958 --> 12:39.523
Beans?

12:39.525 --> 12:41.124
Uh-oh, it looks like
we'll be at war

12:41.126 --> 12:42.759
with these
Indians soon.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.161
( groaning )

12:44.163 --> 12:47.497
Wait, wait, wait,
here it comes.

12:47.499 --> 12:49.466
( farts )

12:49.468 --> 12:51.301
I crapped
in my pants!

12:51.303 --> 12:54.137
I think you got
some "spat" on

12:54.139 --> 12:56.006
Chief Running Wolf.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.874
I "spatted"
his face.

12:57.876 --> 12:59.276
Now he's
a smelly Indian.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.178
We'll be back
to part fourteen of

13:01.180 --> 13:03.380
"The Terrance and Phillip
Thanksgiving Special"

13:03.382 --> 13:04.181
right after this.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.317
Hunger is an enemy
that we all must fight.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.920
These children desperately
need your support.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.323
( Cartman )
Hey, somebody
get me out of here!

13:13.325 --> 13:14.191
This sucks!

13:14.193 --> 13:17.361
So please call
and adopt a child today.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.663
I'm seriously
getting pissed off!

13:19.665 --> 13:22.466
YOU WANT SOME MORE
CHEESY POOFS, HON?

13:22.468 --> 13:24.634
YEAH, I WANT
THE CHEESY POOFS.

13:24.636 --> 13:25.702
OKAY.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.170
SWEET.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.673
THIS IS SERIOUS
BULL?&í%$!

13:29.675 --> 13:31.308
THERE HAS TO BE
A "HAPPY BURGER"

13:31.310 --> 13:33.076
AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE!

13:33.078 --> 13:34.544
EXCUSE ME,

13:34.546 --> 13:36.646
I AM A LOST
LITTLE BOY.

13:36.648 --> 13:38.749
COULD YOU HELP ME?

13:40.085 --> 13:42.352
WELL, SCREW YOU TOO!

13:42.354 --> 13:42.953
WHAT THE...

13:42.955 --> 13:44.688
WHO THE HELL LET ALL
THESE FLIES IN HERE?

13:44.690 --> 13:47.591
HASN'T ANYBODY EVER HEARD
OF INSECT REPELLENT?

13:49.094 --> 13:50.193
ALRIGHT EVERYONE,

13:50.195 --> 13:54.498
IT'S TIME TO GIVE OUT
CANNED FOOD TO THE POOR.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.734
HEY, WHERE'S CARTMAN?

13:57.736 --> 13:58.402
I DON'T KNOW.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.570
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
HE IS MARVIN?

14:00.572 --> 14:02.973
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
THE TURKEY PROBLEM

14:02.975 --> 14:04.341
UNDER CONTROL.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.044
IT'S TIME TO EMBRACE
THE SPIRIT OF GIVING

14:07.046 --> 14:10.113
WITH THE CANNED
FOOD GRAB.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.717
COME ON,
HURRY UP.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.489
GRAB A LOT, SON.

14:19.491 --> 14:23.894
HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
LET HER RIP!

14:26.865 --> 14:30.700
COME ON, GRAB THOSE
CANS LITTLE BOY!

14:33.005 --> 14:34.971
COME ON,
KENNY! COME ON, KENNY!

14:34.973 --> 14:36.573
COME ON SON!

14:38.510 --> 14:40.744
NOW LET'S SEE
ALL THE GOODIES

14:40.746 --> 14:44.247
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
HOME TO YOUR FAMILY.

14:44.783 --> 14:50.353
IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT
A CAN OF STRING BEANS.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.658
( howling turkeys )

14:54.660 --> 14:55.192
WHAT THE...?!

14:55.194 --> 14:57.894
DUDE, THE MUTANT
TURKEYS ARE BACK!

15:03.402 --> 15:05.302
OKAY PEOPLE,
MOVE ALONG.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.637
NOTHING TO SEE HERE,
YOU<i> LOOKY-LU'S</i>!.

15:07.639 --> 15:10.040
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.908
GATHER AROUND,
EVERYBODY,

15:11.910 --> 15:13.176
AND LISTEN GOOD.

15:13.178 --> 15:16.379
GO TO YOU HOMES
AND ARM YOUR...

15:21.286 --> 15:24.254
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWAY?

15:24.256 --> 15:27.357
THAT'S NOT
IMPORTANT
RIGHT NOW.

15:27.359 --> 15:27.824
NO?

15:27.826 --> 15:29.659
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
LITTLE THING SUPPOSED TO BE?!

15:29.661 --> 15:31.495
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ANYTHING!

15:31.497 --> 15:33.096
CHEF, THE TURKEYS.

15:33.098 --> 15:33.930
OH ALRIGHT,

15:33.932 --> 15:36.266
LISTEN UP EVERYBODY
AND LISTEN GOOD.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.002
GO TO YOUR HOMES
AN ARM YOURSELVES

15:39.004 --> 15:40.370
WITH WHATEVER
YOU CAN.

15:40.372 --> 15:43.673
WE'LL MEET BACK HERE
IN 15 MINUTES.

15:43.675 --> 15:44.975
HURRY.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.544
WE ARE NOT GONNA LET
OUR THANKSGIVING

15:47.546 --> 15:50.347
BE RUINED BY A
BUNCH OF TURKEYS.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.718
HEY GUYS...

15:54.720 --> 15:57.754
SERIOUSLY,
I'M HUNGRY.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.089
I HAVE TO EAT.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.691
OH SWEET,
THE RED CROSS.

16:01.693 --> 16:02.726
I'LL HAVE
FRIED CHICKEN

16:02.728 --> 16:05.095
AND A SIDE OF
MASHED POTATOES, PLEASE.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.763
SORRY KID, BUT
WE'RE OUT OF FOOD.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.431
WE RAN OUT OF FUNDING.

16:08.433 --> 16:08.765
WHAT?

16:08.767 --> 16:10.734
WE JUST COULDN'T GET
ENOUGH SPONSORS BACK HOME.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.235
SO NOW WE'VE
GOT TO PACK IT UP.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.970
BUT I'M NOT A
STARVIN'<i> ETHERNOPIAN.</i>

16:13.972 --> 16:15.205
I HAVE TO GET
BACK HOME TOO!

16:15.207 --> 16:17.841
SORRY DUDE, WE JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY FUNDS.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.110
HERE, HAVE A TEIKO
SPORTS WATCH.

16:24.516 --> 16:28.151
PEOPLE, WE ALL HAVE TO
DO OUR PART

16:28.153 --> 16:30.654
AGAINST
THE EVIL TURKEYS.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.722
THERE'S TOO
MANY OF THEM.

16:32.724 --> 16:33.223
COME ON,

16:33.225 --> 16:35.725
WHERE IS THAT
THANKSGIVING SPIRIT?

16:35.727 --> 16:38.361
WE CAN'T
STOP THEM.

16:40.766 --> 16:44.201
TODAY, YOU FIGHT
FOR YOUR CITY,

16:44.203 --> 16:46.102
YOU FIGHT
FOR YOUR HONOR.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.471
THESE TURKEYS WILL
CONTINUE TO PUSH

16:48.473 --> 16:51.575
UNTIL THEY HAVE TAKEN
EVERYTHING FROM US.

16:51.577 --> 16:55.712
THESE FUDGED UP TURKEYS FROM
THE CRUSTACIOUS ERA

16:55.714 --> 16:57.881
CAN TAKE OUR LIVES,

16:57.883 --> 17:02.352
BUT THEY CAN NEVER
TAKE OUR FREEDOM!

17:05.524 --> 17:06.723
WHOO!

17:06.725 --> 17:07.924
YEAH, WHOO!

17:07.926 --> 17:11.761
( gobbling )

17:25.043 --> 17:26.810
HERE YOU GO TURKEYS.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.085
DOES MY HAIR
LOOK OKAY?

17:38.590 --> 17:41.358
I NEED...

17:41.360 --> 17:43.727
...APPETIZERS.

17:44.429 --> 17:46.329

18:41.553 --> 18:43.953

19:25.797 --> 19:26.930

19:26.932 --> 19:28.465

19:28.467 --> 19:30.900
SHOOT 'EM NED!

19:31.670 --> 19:32.602

19:32.604 --> 19:34.971

19:34.973 --> 19:36.706
WE'VE SAVED
THANKSGIVING.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.675
BUT ALL THOSE

19:39.945 --> 19:41.344
EVERY TURKEYS DIES.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.913
NOT EVERY TURKEY

19:43.915 --> 19:46.015
AS HORRIBLE AS
THEY WERE, THEY,

19:46.017 --> 19:47.283
THEY FELT LIKE
A PART OF ME.

19:47.285 --> 19:49.953
PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T BE
TOYING WITH GOD'S CREATIONS.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.521
PERHAPS
I SHOULD JUST...

19:51.523 --> 19:52.989
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

19:52.991 --> 19:53.890
EXCUSE ME SIR,

19:53.892 --> 19:55.992
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A
LITTLE STARVIN' ETHIOPIAN BOY

19:55.994 --> 19:57.927
WHO WAS ACCIDENTALLY
DELIVERED TO SOUTH PARK

19:57.929 --> 19:59.295
INSTEAD OF A
TEIKO SPORTS WATCH.

19:59.297 --> 20:01.231
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYONE FITTING
THIS DESCRIPTION?

20:01.233 --> 20:03.533
OH, THAT COULD
BE A HUNDRED KIDS

20:03.535 --> 20:05.068
IN THIS TOWN, MISTER.

HE HAS TO LEAVE.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.621
YEAH, I LIKE HIM A LOT
MORE THAN CARTMAN.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.456
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.793
IT'S REALLY EASY NOT TO THINK
OF IMAGES ON TV AS PEOPLE.

20:29.795 --> 20:30.827
BUT THEY ARE.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.662
THAT'S WHY IT'S EASY TO
IGNORE THOSE COMMERCIALS.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.899
BUT PEOPLE ON TV ARE JUST
AS REAL AS YOU OR I.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.466
YEAH,

20:36.468 --> 20:38.935
AND THAT MEANS THAT
MacGUYVER'S A REAL
PERSON TOO.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.305
WE'RE TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT
THE MIX UP LITTLE BOY.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.274
WE'LL GET YOU BACK
HOME IMMEDIATELY.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.342
THAT'S RIGHT
YOU WILL GODAMMIT.

20:46.344 --> 20:49.712
MOVE IT POVs,
I'M AN AMERICAN!

20:53.785 --> 20:57.587
( clicking noises )

21:14.206 --> 21:15.939
LORD,
ON THIS DAY OF THANKS

21:15.941 --> 21:18.174
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND
OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE

21:18.176 --> 21:21.678
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE
BOUNTY OF GREEN BEANS

21:21.680 --> 21:23.179
YOU HAVE BESTOWED
UPON US.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.848
AND THOUGH YOU,
FOR SOME REASON,

21:24.850 --> 21:26.916
FOUND IT NECESSARY
TO TAKE OUR SON FROM US

21:26.918 --> 21:29.953
AND THOUGH YOU,
FOR SOME REASON FIND PLEASURE

21:29.955 --> 21:31.921
IN WATCHING US
SUFFER,

21:31.923 --> 21:33.923
STILL,
WE GIVE THANKS.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.225
AMEN.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.326
AMEN.

21:36.328 --> 21:40.296

A CAN OPENER?

21:40.298 --> 21:41.965
