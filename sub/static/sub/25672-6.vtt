09:00.510 --> 09:04.320

09:07.650 --> 09:11.710

<font size="20"><b>You could say her Titan
had unsurpassable power.</b></font>

09:16.110 --> 09:21.690

<font size="20"><b>Unable to unleash her true potential,</b></font>

09:26.400 --> 09:30.430

<font size="20"><b>But that's not all...</b></font>

09:34.720 --> 09:36.830
<font size="20"><b>He then attacked my entire family.</b></font>

09:37.550 --> 09:39.890
<font size="20"><b>His rampage sought to 
eradicate the Reiss family.</b></font>

09:42.100 --> 09:46.190
<font size="20"><b>He crushed the 14-year-old Dirk
and 12-year-old Abel.</b></font>

09:46.640 --> 09:49.810
<font size="20"><b>He trampled over my wife and 10-year-old

09:50.400 --> 09:53.840
<font size="20"><b>Lastly, he took my eldest son, Ulklin,

<font size="20"><b>Miraculously, I was the only
one who made it away.</b></font>

10:04.750 --> 10:05.880

<font size="20"><b>I suspected Dhalis Zachary 
had such ambitions.</b></font>

13:53.140 --> 13:55.950
<font size="20"><b>Unlike you, I'm not very fond of gambling.</b></font>

13:56.520 --> 13:58.270
<font size="20"><b>And also, unlike you...</b></font>

13:59.020 --> 14:02.520
<font size="20"><b>...I value the number of remaining
humans over my own life.</b></font>

14:04.150 --> 14:09.380
<font size="20"><b>The reason I backed you was because I
believed it the superior choice for humanity.</b></font>

14:09.910 --> 14:13.040
<font size="20"><b>Had the government been the favorable choice,</b></font>

14:13.350 --> 14:16.400
<font size="20"><b>I was prepared to fight against Zachary.</b></font>

14:17.750 --> 14:23.190
<font size="20"><b>To think, we're comrades just following
a coup d'Ã©tat, and look what I'm saying...</b></font>

14:23.670 --> 14:29.090
<font size="20"><b>I once heard a song that someday humans
will stop fighting, but when will that be?</b></font>

14:31.100 --> 14:31.800
<font size="20"><b>Commander!</b></font>

14:32.550 --> 14:34.590
<font size="20"><b>All troops are prepared and ready!</b></font>

14:35.350 --> 14:36.420
<font size="20"><b>We're ready to go!</b></font>

14:39.230 --> 14:44.120
<font size="20"><b>Humans will continue to fight one another
until the day there's one human or less.</b></font>

14:46.690 --> 14:50.030
<font size="20"><b>I was hoping for a better answer
than some bleak hyperbole.</b></font>

14:50.610 --> 14:52.280
<font size="20"><b>All troops, fall in!</b></font>

14:52.620 --> 14:57.040
<font size="20"><b>Our mission to recover Eren
and Historia will now commence!</b></font>

14:57.410 --> 15:01.250
<font size="20"><b>We make for their location, believed
to be the chapel on Reiss territory!</b></font>

15:04.170 --> 15:05.180
<font size="20"><b>Understand?</b></font>

15:05.830 --> 15:07.180
<font size="20"><b>He's Kenny the Ripper.</b></font>

15:07.670 --> 15:10.080
<font size="20"><b>If he's there, he'll be our biggest obstacle.</b></font>

15:10.630 --> 15:13.660
<font size="20"><b>In terms of how much of a threat he is,
equate him to me as an enemy.</b></font>

15:14.180 --> 15:17.470
<font size="20"><b>No... With those weapons of his,
he's deadlier than me.</b></font>

15:17.680 --> 15:20.480
<font size="20"><b>Then he's unbeatable, at least for us...</b></font>

15:20.480 --> 15:22.940
<font size="20"><b>If we could meet up with the troops--</b></font>

15:22.940 --> 15:23.980
<font size="20"><b>Absolutely not.</b></font>

15:24.270 --> 15:25.770
<font size="20"><b>I know, absolutely not!</b></font>

15:25.770 --> 15:28.490
<font size="20"><b>If we wait until morning, Eren 
might end up getting eaten!</b></font>

15:29.070 --> 15:34.490
<font size="20"><b>Though, if what the captain said is true,
it's not like he has no weak points.</b></font>

15:34.740 --> 15:35.990
<font size="20"><b>For real, Armin?</b></font>

15:35.990 --> 15:40.210
<font size="20"><b>Yeah, I'm sure he's trained plenty, but having
combat experience is something else.</b></font>

15:40.400 --> 15:45.000
<font size="20"><b>I wonder, how is it that you
lived with Kenny the Ripper</b></font>

15:45.000 --> 15:46.800
<font size="20"><b>but know almost nothing about him, Levi?</b></font>

15:46.800 --> 15:50.220
<font size="20"><b>Sorry, but I only found out
his full name not too long ago.</b></font>

15:51.130 --> 15:53.330
<font size="20"><b>Apparently, it's Kenny Ackermann.</b></font>

15:54.010 --> 15:55.970
<font size="20"><b>He some relative of yours?</b></font>

15:59.180 --> 16:03.730
<font size="20"><b>I heard from my parents when they were alive
that my dad's side, the Ackermanns,</b></font>

16:04.310 --> 16:06.950
<font size="20"><b>were persecuted in the cities.</b></font>

16:08.400 --> 16:10.900
<font size="20"><b>My mom's family was Oriental,</b></font>

16:10.900 --> 16:14.060
<font size="20"><b>so being a different race meant 
they didn't fit in anywhere.</b></font>

16:14.370 --> 16:18.660
<font size="20"><b>Both were people chased deep in the
mountains near the edge of the walls,</b></font>

16:18.660 --> 16:20.130
<font size="20"><b>so that's how they met and married.</b></font>

16:21.160 --> 16:24.320
<font size="20"><b>But I never found out why the
Ackermanns were persecuted.</b></font>

16:25.170 --> 16:29.760
<font size="20"><b>My dad didn't seem like a
different race like my mom was.</b></font>

16:31.760 --> 16:34.380
<font size="20"><b>Has there ever been a moment</b></font>

16:34.380 --> 16:37.480
<font size="20"><b>where it's felt like power 
suddenly awakened inside you?</b></font>

16:45.020 --> 16:45.850
<font size="20"><b>There has.</b></font>

16:52.860 --> 16:56.260
<font size="20"><b>Kenny Ackermann had a moment like that, too.</b></font>

16:57.160 --> 16:59.240
<font size="20"><b>One time, out of nowhere,</b></font>

16:59.240 --> 17:02.400
<font size="20"><b>he felt an absurd amount of 
strength surging within him</b></font>

17:02.750 --> 17:04.980
<font size="20"><b>and he knew exactly what he had to do.</b></font>

17:06.079 --> 17:08.710
<font size="20"><b>I've felt moments like that, too.</b></font>

17:23.180 --> 17:25.060
<font size="20"><b>Fess up, Gramps.</b></font>

17:26.599 --> 17:28.980
<font size="20"><b>You're about to die anyways, right?</b></font>

17:31.780 --> 17:33.110
<font size="20"><b>Kenny...</b></font>

17:33.560 --> 17:36.710
<font size="20"><b>Were you out killing more Military Police?</b></font>

17:37.200 --> 17:38.150
<font size="20"><b>Yeah...</b></font>

17:38.960 --> 17:41.410
<font size="20"><b>If you're talking about
those goons snooping around,</b></font>

17:41.410 --> 17:43.870
<font size="20"><b>they're in the ground helping the trees grow.</b></font>

17:46.620 --> 17:48.500
<font size="20"><b>Speaking of branches,</b></font>

17:48.500 --> 17:51.690
<font size="20"><b>the branch family moved down 
south around Shiganshina.</b></font>

17:52.630 --> 17:56.360
<font size="20"><b>But it turns out someone's interfering 
with their business there, too,</b></font>

17:56.360 --> 17:58.940
<font size="20"><b>so they're still poor as hell.</b></font>

17:59.930 --> 18:01.350
<font size="20"><b>What's the big deal?</b></font>

18:02.060 --> 18:05.580
<font size="20"><b>Didn't the Ackermanns use to be a
family of warriors protecting the King?</b></font>

18:06.100 --> 18:08.900
<font size="20"><b>Now the whole family is on
the verge of extinction.</b></font>

18:09.690 --> 18:12.650
<font size="20"><b>The hell did you do to
piss off the King so much?</b></font>

18:15.190 --> 18:18.410
<font size="20"><b>C'mon, fess up.
Wontcha tell your cute grandson?</b></font>

18:24.330 --> 18:26.970
<font size="20"><b>What cute grandson?</b></font>

18:27.290 --> 18:31.920
<font size="20"><b>The one who's Kenny the Ripper,
terror of the capital?</b></font>

18:32.800 --> 18:36.340
<font size="20"><b>The Ackermann family isn't hated by the King.</b></font>

18:36.800 --> 18:39.030
<font size="20"><b>It's just, they're afraid of us.</b></font>

18:39.550 --> 18:43.930
<font size="20"><b>It's because the King isn't able
to control the Ackermann family.</b></font>

18:45.020 --> 18:46.310
<font size="20"><b>Control?</b></font>

18:47.020 --> 18:50.190
<font size="20"><b>I personally don't know all there is to know.</b></font>

18:50.190 --> 19:00.070
<font size="20"><b>But it's true that our family was once the
King's sword and one of their vital supporters.</b></font>

19:00.450 --> 19:06.080
<font size="20"><b>However, the King passes down the Power
of the Titans from generation to generation.</b></font>

19:06.750 --> 19:10.000
<font size="20"><b>Huh? What's this Power of the Titans?</b></font>

19:10.170 --> 19:12.790
<font size="20"><b>It's an immense power they possess</b></font>

19:12.790 --> 19:18.530
<font size="20"><b>to alter all of humanity's memories
and make them entirely forget the past.</b></font>

19:19.010 --> 19:21.560
<font size="20"><b>Except for a few noble bloodlines.</b></font>

19:22.220 --> 19:26.530
<font size="20"><b>Among them, there were two groups
that turned their back on the King.</b></font>

19:27.350 --> 19:31.650
<font size="20"><b>That is, the Oriental clan
and the Ackermann family.</b></font>

19:32.730 --> 19:34.470
<font size="20"><b>Hence the persecution.</b></font>

19:35.320 --> 19:37.200
<font size="20"><b>Such a dreadful story.</b></font>

19:41.570 --> 19:44.910
<font size="20"><b>It ain't the heartwarming story 
you wanna hear on your deathbed,</b></font>

19:44.910 --> 19:47.120

19:58.170 --> 19:58.710
<font size="20"><b>Hell...</b></font>

19:59.840 --> 20:02.910
<font size="20"><b>Being born in this piece of shit world...</b></font>

20:02.910 --> 20:05.850
<font size="20"><b>Ain't a single damn dream

20:10.480 --> 20:11.350

20:29.200 --> 20:31.910
<font size="20"><b>You can be sure Levi's among them.</b></font>

20:32.790 --> 20:37.130
<font size="20"><b>As you know, Levi got completely 
ambushed last time</b></font>

20:37.130 --> 20:39.760
<font size="20"><b>and yet he still killed 12 of our comrades.</b></font>

20:40.920 --> 20:44.180
