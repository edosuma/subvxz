00:01.580 --> 00:03.080
<b>Neferpitou.</b>

00:03.820 --> 00:04.730
<b>Huh?</b>

00:04.730 --> 00:07.980
<b>That is the name the Queen gave me.</b>

00:08.480 --> 00:11.650
<b>From now on, call me Neferpitou.</b>

01:31.980 --> 01:36.990
<b>Light x And x Darkness</b>

01:40.870 --> 01:43.700
<b>Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains...</b>

01:43.700 --> 01:46.580
<b>Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.</b>

01:47.000 --> 01:50.910
<b>Commander Neferpitou will hold</b>

01:50.910 --> 01:54.510
<b>an award ceremony in auditorium one.</b>

01:57.940 --> 02:01.450
<b>If you are able to endure considerable pain,</b>

02:01.450 --> 02:04.260
<b>you will receive tremendous power in return.</b>

02:04.260 --> 02:08.620
<b>That power is to be used for our Queen!</b>

02:19.550 --> 02:21.780
<b>They're continuing to go straight.</b>

02:22.510 --> 02:26.790
<b>The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.</b>

02:27.510 --> 02:28.930
<b>Amazing...</b>

02:29.400 --> 02:32.870
<b>He's been picking them up this entire time, 
never losing them for an instant.</b>

02:32.870 --> 02:36.920
<b>Kite said he could use <i>En</i> within 
a radius of forty-five meters.</b>

02:37.340 --> 02:41.950
<b>I've heard that those called <i>Nen</i> masters 
can handle around fifty meters.</b>

02:42.570 --> 02:44.730
<b>Kite is nearly there.</b>

02:45.250 --> 02:48.300
<b>Actually, given that he's kept 
it up for an entire night,</b>

02:48.300 --> 02:49.670
<b>he's probably stronger.</b>

02:52.230 --> 02:54.190
<b>Stronger than a master...</b>

02:57.620 --> 03:00.230
<b>Then Kite's the real deal.</b>

03:00.230 --> 03:04.700
<b>Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met.</b>

03:05.890 --> 03:07.950
<b>Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,</b>

03:08.410 --> 03:13.110
<b>but we really only knew him 
as another player in a game.</b>

03:14.440 --> 03:16.460
<b>Bisky was an incredible Hunter.</b>

03:16.830 --> 03:18.420
<b>But to us...</b>

03:18.420 --> 03:19.920
<b>Yeah, she was our <i>Nen</i> mentor.</b>

03:21.750 --> 03:24.220
<b>And the first to teach us about <i>Nen</i>...</b>

03:24.900 --> 03:27.100
<b>Wing-san was our <i>Nen</i> master and savior.</b>

03:29.990 --> 03:31.910
<b>Looking back,</b>

03:31.910 --> 03:35.240
<b>we always meet the right people 
just when we need them most.</b>

03:36.030 --> 03:40.740
<b>And those people have all made us stronger.</b>

03:41.360 --> 03:43.220
<b>Razor, too, huh?</b>

03:43.220 --> 03:43.990
<b>Yeah.</b>

03:45.140 --> 03:50.370
<b>It's clear that Ging really did create 
<i>Greed Island </i>to train you.</b>

03:50.840 --> 03:54.630
<b>And once you beat the game, 
he deliberately led you to Kite.</b>

03:55.230 --> 03:56.250
<b>Ging!</b>

04:09.600 --> 04:14.400
<b>I'm not sure if Ging predicted what 
would happen when we met Kite.</b>

04:18.020 --> 04:19.900
<b>But he certainly knew</b>

04:20.230 --> 04:23.830
<b>that you would like the man who 
had earned Ging's respect.</b>

04:25.470 --> 04:29.220
<b>And he knew without doubt 
that you would go with Kite.</b>

04:29.660 --> 04:33.920
<b>He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.</b>

04:34.790 --> 04:38.420
<b>This is a pretty brutal place for training, though.</b>

04:38.950 --> 04:43.550
<b>That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.</b>

04:47.390 --> 04:49.560
<b>As you mentioned,</b>

04:50.800 --> 04:56.060
<b>Ging-san probably had certain 
expectations when he sent you to me.</b>

04:56.840 --> 05:01.510
<b>But I do not intend to train 
you during this journey.</b>

05:01.940 --> 05:03.940
<b>We don't have that kind of time.</b>

05:06.460 --> 05:10.320
<b>I brought you along because I 
thought you might be of use.</b>

05:10.870 --> 05:13.940
<b>From here, it all comes down to your resolve.</b>

05:14.610 --> 05:18.990
<b>If it's strong, you'll develop your <i>Nen</i> 
and grow strong via combat.</b>

05:19.710 --> 05:23.170
<b>If it's weak, the Ants will eat you.</b>

05:24.990 --> 05:27.150
<b>But we can't die...</b>

05:28.110 --> 05:30.680
<b>We are pro Hunters.</b>

05:30.960 --> 05:35.430
<b>Those who call themselves 
Hunters always get their prey.</b>

05:37.420 --> 05:42.920
<b>For Hunters, that is the first commandment.</b>

05:39.270 --> 05:44.320
<b>Those who call themselves Hunters 
should always be on the hunt.</b>

05:45.040 --> 05:48.570
<b>A hunt involves both hunter and prey.</b>

05:48.570 --> 05:51.080
<b>It is a battle of resolve.</b>

05:51.960 --> 05:56.780
<b>Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve 
is what makes a successful hunt.</b>

05:57.760 --> 06:01.040
<b>The loser has to follow the 
winner's rules and customs.</b>

06:01.040 --> 06:03.340
<b>Usually, this means the loser's death.</b>

06:04.270 --> 06:05.340
<b>Rules...</b>

06:06.030 --> 06:08.410
<b>If you don't want that result, then win.</b>

06:08.830 --> 06:10.740
<b>Improving your <i>Nen</i> is important, of course.</b>

06:11.250 --> 06:17.030
<b>But to be a successful Hunter, you must 
understand your enemy and yourself.</b>

06:18.110 --> 06:19.780
<b>Th-That's why...</b>

06:19.780 --> 06:23.150
<b>That's why you hit me back then!</b>

06:29.340 --> 06:30.320
<b><i>Fool!</i></b>

06:30.610 --> 06:34.030
<b><i>Why would you try to enter Snake 
Beech Forest in this season?!</i></b>

06:35.330 --> 06:36.340
<b><i>Look!</i></b>

06:36.340 --> 06:39.930
<b><i>That's a territorial marker 
made by Foxbears with cubs.</i></b>

06:39.930 --> 06:45.090
<b><i>Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!</i></b>

06:47.920 --> 06:50.970
<b>That was the forest's rule and custom.</b>

06:53.580 --> 06:56.810
<b>You taught me the rules in Ging's place.</b>

07:04.320 --> 07:05.360
<b>Oh...</b>

07:06.830 --> 07:09.470
<b>That's right... I just remembered.</b>

07:14.090 --> 07:15.830
<b>A Hunter License?</b>

07:16.130 --> 07:17.120
<b>What's this?</b>

07:17.610 --> 07:18.870
<b>This is Ging-san's.</b>

07:18.870 --> 07:21.120
<b>Huh? It's Ging's?</b>

07:21.670 --> 07:25.250
<b>Do you remember what my final test was?</b>

07:26.020 --> 07:29.380
<b>Yeah, to find Ging.</b>

07:29.750 --> 07:33.490
<b>Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me.</b>

07:34.350 --> 07:38.060
<b>He said I should use it to find him...</b>

07:40.590 --> 07:44.110
<b>I planned to return it to him once I did.</b>

07:44.630 --> 07:46.900
<b>Huh? He wouldn't take it back?</b>

07:47.230 --> 07:48.190
<b>No...</b>

07:48.740 --> 07:51.040
<b>I completely forgot I had it.</b>

07:52.620 --> 07:57.280
<b>Gon, you said that you're going to 
find Ging-san on your own, right?</b>

07:57.280 --> 07:58.190
<b>Huh?</b>

07:59.080 --> 08:00.040
<b>Yeah.</b>

08:00.410 --> 08:02.630
<b>Then you have to do it.</b>

08:02.900 --> 08:06.510
<b>And would you return this for me?</b>

08:06.510 --> 08:07.440
<b>Sure!</b>

08:07.920 --> 08:13.550
<b>But first, I have to finish this job 
with you and get a lot stronger.</b>

08:14.220 --> 08:18.060
<b>After that, I'll find Ging and give this back.</b>

08:18.810 --> 08:20.140
<b>I promise!</b>

08:21.660 --> 08:23.040
<b>I'm counting on you.</b>

08:24.710 --> 08:25.560
<b>Well,</b>

08:25.860 --> 08:29.400
<b>let's get a move on before we lose the trail.</b>

08:34.980 --> 08:36.460
<b>Take that!</b>

08:38.590 --> 08:39.830
<b>Next!</b>

08:41.070 --> 08:43.490
<b><i>Being average is terrible...</i></b>

08:43.490 --> 08:47.370
<b><i>You have to go to all this trouble 
just to unleash your power.</i></b>

08:53.580 --> 08:55.830
<b>Peggy, I'll leave this to you.</b>

08:55.830 --> 08:56.970
<b>Where are you going?</b>

08:58.050 --> 09:02.500
<b>I want to find out how strong I really am.</b>

09:07.450 --> 09:08.700
<b>That's a monster.</b>

09:10.320 --> 09:12.100
<b>What is this?</b>

09:12.100 --> 09:13.500
<b>I don't believe it!</b>

09:13.500 --> 09:15.260
<b>What's wrong, Kite?</b>

09:15.260 --> 09:16.430
<b>Gon, Killua...</b>

09:16.430 --> 09:17.330
<b>Run!</b>

09:17.330 --> 09:17.990
<b>Huh?</b>

09:18.390 --> 09:19.700
<b>Hurry up!</b>

09:19.700 --> 09:21.030
<b>Get out of here!</b>

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
<b>Found you...</b>

09:37.570 --> 09:39.220
<b>Get away from me!</b>

10:03.180 --> 10:05.180
<b>Malice</b>

10:19.850 --> 10:20.470
<b>Idioâ€”</b>

10:26.080 --> 10:27.890
<b>Good decision, Killua.</b>

10:29.200 --> 10:31.400
<b>Take Gon and run!</b>

10:48.820 --> 10:50.920
<b>This time, you're in big trouble...</b>

10:51.120 --> 10:53.030
<b>Let's see if you get a good roll!</b>

10:54.800 --> 10:55.910
<b>3!</b>

10:55.910 --> 10:58.920
<b>Ah, so you can do stuff like that?</b>

11:22.950 --> 11:25.530
<b><i>We were overconfident...</i></b>

11:35.950 --> 11:39.010
<b><i>The two of us were still weaker 
than Kite who'd lost an arm.</i></b>

11:40.180 --> 11:41.890
<b><i>That thing knew.</i></b>

11:43.580 --> 11:45.100
<b><i>This is reality.</i></b>

11:46.750 --> 11:47.970
<b><i>If Kite had been alone,</i></b>

11:48.750 --> 11:50.680
<b><i>this probably wouldn't have happened.</i></b>

11:53.810 --> 11:56.730
<b><i>We were fools!</i></b>

12:14.350 --> 12:15.290
<b>Hey...</b>

12:22.180 --> 12:23.220
<b>Look.</b>

13:03.890 --> 13:06.340
<b>Huh? You left Kite behind?</b>

13:06.340 --> 13:07.760
<b>Why?!</b>

13:08.010 --> 13:09.540
<b>What happened?</b>

13:09.540 --> 13:11.270
<b>Explain what's going on!</b>

13:11.270 --> 13:14.020
<b>H-Hey, what are you doing?!</b>

13:15.450 --> 13:17.480
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>

13:17.480 --> 13:19.520
<b>Can you wait there a little longer?</b>

13:19.860 --> 13:23.030
<b>We're headed your way right now.</b>

13:24.050 --> 13:26.230
<b>We have reinforcements.</b>

14:10.840 --> 14:12.260
<b><i>Chairman Netero.</i></b>

14:13.200 --> 14:15.500
<b>What's this? They're just kids.</b>

14:16.500 --> 14:20.350
<b>If you're here to play, you'll get burned.</b>

14:20.350 --> 14:22.590
<b>Go back home.</b>

14:25.570 --> 14:27.590
<b>Stop it, Morel-san.</b>

14:28.800 --> 14:30.470
<b>That isn't nice...</b>

14:32.840 --> 14:35.720
<b>They're only children.</b>

14:40.880 --> 14:43.510
<b>You look pretty defeated.</b>

14:45.510 --> 14:48.240
<b>Was the enemy that strong?</b>

14:56.340 --> 14:58.410
<b>One of them could use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

14:59.800 --> 15:04.470
<b>That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.</b>

15:06.290 --> 15:07.350
<b>Worse than my brother's...</b>

15:09.930 --> 15:11.000
<b>Worse than Hisoka's...</b>

15:16.060 --> 15:18.860
<b>Now that I've learned <i>Nen</i> myself, I can tell.</b>

15:20.930 --> 15:23.740
<b>You guys are unbelievably strong.</b>

15:26.140 --> 15:30.010
<b>But I still can't see you defeating that thing...</b>

15:37.090 --> 15:40.010
<b>Whenever humans encounter the unknown,</b>

15:40.010 --> 15:42.490
<b>they tend to lose perspective.</b>

15:43.830 --> 15:47.920
<b>Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic.</b>

15:48.620 --> 15:53.430
<b>We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed.</b>

15:55.810 --> 15:59.430
<b>You're no better than I am, Knov.</b>

16:02.930 --> 16:04.090
<b>Kid...</b>

16:04.090 --> 16:10.460
<b>The minute you start talking about who 
can win in a <i>Nen</i> fight, you're wrong.</b>

16:11.200 --> 16:14.690
<b>In most cases, you won't know 
your opponent's abilities.</b>

16:16.260 --> 16:19.070
<b>One instant of carelessness</b>

16:19.950 --> 16:23.090
<b>is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.</b>

16:24.350 --> 16:30.000
<b>You can't make assumptions based 
on the amount of aura displayed.</b>

16:30.680 --> 16:33.970
<b>The battle can turn at any point.</b>

16:34.460 --> 16:36.470
<b>That's what fighting with <i>Nen</i> means.</b>

16:37.500 --> 16:39.680
<b>But regardless,</b>

16:40.460 --> 16:43.150
<b>you must always fight certain of victory.</b>

16:44.260 --> 16:47.170
<b>That is a <i>Nen</i> user's spirit.</b>

16:48.340 --> 16:50.570
<b>The moment you were overwhelmed</b>

16:50.570 --> 16:52.790
<b>by the opponent's aura and fled, 
you were disqualified.</b>

16:53.450 --> 16:54.890
<b>You're lower than a loser!</b>

16:54.890 --> 16:56.990
<b>Morel, that's enough.</b>

16:58.210 --> 17:01.000
<b>Is Gon asleep?</b>

17:01.930 --> 17:04.810
<b>He was going to attack the enemy,</b>

17:04.810 --> 17:06.500
<b>so I used force to stop him.</b>

17:07.840 --> 17:09.850
<b>I didn't have time to control my strength,</b>

17:10.370 --> 17:12.010
<b>so I don't know when he'll wake up.</b>

17:13.820 --> 17:16.500
<b>That kid shows some promise, then.</b>

17:16.500 --> 17:17.760
<b>Morel!</b>

17:18.680 --> 17:23.450
<b>It's difficult to believe that giant 
Chimera Ants are eating humans,</b>

17:24.050 --> 17:26.310
<b>but since it appears to be true,</b>

17:26.310 --> 17:29.900
<b>we must keep casualties to a minimum.</b>

17:30.360 --> 17:35.270
<b>If we send fighters who aren't strong enough, 
they'll only strengthen the enemy.</b>

17:36.140 --> 17:37.410
<b>Do you understand?</b>

17:38.160 --> 17:39.150
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:45.030 --> 17:46.900
<b><i>That's why there are only three.</i></b>

17:47.770 --> 17:49.280
<b><i>A select few...</i></b>

17:51.150 --> 17:52.510
<b><i>We're not</i></b>

17:53.710 --> 17:55.200
<b><i>strong enough.</i></b>

18:02.310 --> 18:06.030
<b><i>We sent two assassins to the nearest village.</i></b>

18:09.780 --> 18:12.440
<b><i>It's your decision whether you want to fight.</i></b>

18:12.870 --> 18:16.350
<b><i>But you must defeat them before you come.</i></b>

18:19.310 --> 18:21.790
<b><i>If you wish to live as a Hunter...</i></b>

18:24.520 --> 18:26.710
<b><i>We are not desperate for help.</i></b>

18:28.010 --> 18:30.560
<b><i>We only seek the strong.</i></b>

18:44.080 --> 18:47.480
<b>Will you fight!? Or not!?</b>

19:12.650 --> 19:15.170
<b><i>The moment you were overwhelmed</i></b>

19:15.170 --> 19:17.510
<b><i>by the opponent's aura and fled, 
you were disqualified.</i></b>

19:18.590 --> 19:20.100
<b><i>You're lower than a loser!</i></b>

19:21.870 --> 19:24.580
<b><i>I am no longer qualified...</i></b>

19:26.560 --> 19:27.590
<b>Killua...</b>

19:30.340 --> 19:31.470
<b>Thanks.</b>

19:38.600 --> 19:41.520
<b>Why would you thank me?</b>

19:42.460 --> 19:46.060
<b>Weren't you the one who stopped me?</b>

19:47.710 --> 19:52.040
<b>Had I lost control back there, 
I would've gotten in Kite's way.</b>

19:54.250 --> 19:58.050
<b>Then, all three of us could have died.</b>

19:58.380 --> 20:00.550
<b>But I...</b>

20:01.560 --> 20:03.550
<b>I let Kite die...</b>

20:03.730 --> 20:05.180
<b>Kite is alive!</b>

20:06.600 --> 20:10.560
<b>He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!</b>

20:12.130 --> 20:18.470
<b>But considering his injury, 
he'd have a hard time moving around.</b>

20:18.470 --> 20:20.580
<b>So he's probably hiding.</b>

20:22.460 --> 20:24.570
<b>Waiting for us to return!</b>

20:28.530 --> 20:30.820
<b>So we should hurry back...</b>

20:30.820 --> 20:32.020
<b>Once we're stronger.</b>

20:35.260 --> 20:37.000
<b>To save Kite!</b>
