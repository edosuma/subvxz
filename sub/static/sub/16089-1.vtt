<i>I'm just a penny on the train track</i>

00:39.257 --> 00:41.712
<i>Waiting for my judgment day</i>

00:42.234 --> 00:45.333
<i>Come on, baby girl,
let me see those legs</i>

00:45.433 --> 00:48.007
<i>Before I get
flattened away</i>

00:48.442 --> 00:50.133
<i>I wait</i>

00:51.705 --> 00:53.593
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

00:54.969 --> 00:59.541
<i>For something good,
for something great</i>

01:01.722 --> 01:04.788
<i>Stopping in somebody's old home town</i>

01:04.888 --> 01:07.824
<i>Gotta get that midnight meal</i>

01:08.186 --> 01:11.317
<i>If you can't get behind your own life</i>

01:11.418 --> 01:14.200
<i>Get behind the driving wheel</i>

01:14.298 --> 01:19.087
<i>And go, just go</i>

01:21.465 --> 01:25.492
<i>Find a place that you don't know</i>

01:27.962 --> 01:30.777
<i>Ran into a friend just the other night</i>

01:30.874 --> 01:33.263
<i>Got a badge, he's a local cop</i>

01:34.233 --> 01:37.168
<i>Haven't seen that boy in over seven years</i>

01:37.273 --> 01:40.023
<i>Since out of high school I dropped</i>

01:40.122 --> 01:45.523
<i>I see, I see</i>

01:47.417 --> 01:51.956
<i>All the things that I should be</i>

02:13.722 --> 02:15.860
<i>I wait</i>

02:15.962 --> 02:17.369
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

02:19.257 --> 02:23.698
<i>For something good, for something great</i>

02:26.458 --> 02:28.083
<i>Dude! You're totally missing it!</i>

02:28.345 --> 02:31.574
<i>It's fucking crazy here, man! Dude! Kev.</i>

02:31.674 --> 02:33.813
<i>I've got an idea.</i>
<i>I want you to drop what you are doing.</i>

02:33.913 --> 02:38.223
<i>I want you to come down here</i>
<i>and take a picture of this for the paper!</i>

02:38.330 --> 02:41.941
<i> Now that, my friend,</i>
<i>is front page material. Lateski.</i>

02:47.289 --> 02:48.915
Hey, Mom!
Gina, Morris and I are gonna leave

02:49.017 --> 02:50.741
for Fieldmont right after school today.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.907
Honey, I completely forgot about that.
Can you do it next weekend?

02:54.009 --> 02:57.555
Derek was gonna take me into the city
tomorrow night for dinner.

02:57.657 --> 02:59.664
- God! It's already 7:00?
- We can't.

02:59.769 --> 03:02.224
Morris has a scholarship meeting
and we're signed up for the campus tour.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.501
- Carter.
- Hi. What's up Ms. B?

03:06.234 --> 03:10.325
Dude, she totally threw off my groove!
I was almost at the top level.

03:10.937 --> 03:12.115
- Hey, Carter.
- What's up, man?

03:12.217 --> 03:14.159
What's up, little people?

03:16.601 --> 03:17.943
Running a little bit low.

03:18.042 --> 03:19.830
Kev! Can I ask you a question?

03:19.929 --> 03:22.831
You know that book that Miss Dangle
makes everybody read about the mice?

03:22.937 --> 03:25.971
- You mean <i>Of Mice and Men?</i>
- Bingo! That's the one, yeah.

03:26.074 --> 03:27.480
So let me get this straight.

03:27.577 --> 03:31.800
These two dudes dream of buying
a farm together to raise rabbits?

03:32.537 --> 03:33.912
Hmm.

03:34.010 --> 03:37.490
And I'm no expert,
but doesn't that seem a little...

03:37.594 --> 03:41.423
I don't know. Kind of G-A-Y?

03:41.850 --> 03:43.224
Dude, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

03:43.322 --> 03:46.104
- We can spell, Carter.
- Yeah, dumb A-S-S.

03:47.033 --> 03:48.757
Dude. Satan's children, I swear.
Spawn of Satan.

03:53.081 --> 03:56.343
Right. Come on, guys!
Mrs. Seavers is here. Let's go!

03:57.625 --> 03:59.447
Grab your backpacks.

04:06.841 --> 04:07.769
Oh, yeah!

04:07.866 --> 04:09.142
All right, see you guys!

04:18.457 --> 04:21.305
Would you look at this guy?
Why do we have to hang out with him?

04:21.402 --> 04:22.711
- Hey, Morris.
- Hey, guys.

04:22.809 --> 04:25.297
Hey, Morris,
what's up with all the geek books?

04:25.402 --> 04:27.190
I've got a scholarship interview
in a day, Carter.

04:27.289 --> 04:29.296
And my parents are up my ass about it.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.376
Morris, your parents
are always up your ass.

04:31.481 --> 04:34.001
Besides, don't you want to go to some
fancy-shmancy Ivy League school?

04:34.105 --> 04:35.992
Guys, come on!
Do we really have to start this early?

04:36.089 --> 04:37.780
Well, apparently,
it's not my choice, Carter.

04:37.882 --> 04:39.670
At least Kevin will be there. Right, Kev?

04:39.769 --> 04:42.420
Yep. Hey, did you grab your stuff
so we can split right after school today?

04:42.521 --> 04:44.245
Yeah. It's in my...

04:51.289 --> 04:54.420
Yeah, the technique was a little off,
but the timing was better.

04:54.521 --> 04:55.731
And by the way, she's easy,

04:55.833 --> 04:59.510
but not in the, like,
I'm-gonna-fuck-Morris kind of way easy.

05:00.314 --> 05:01.688
Come on, Kev, I've got to pee.
I need you to shake it.

05:01.786 --> 05:02.833
Carter.

05:07.065 --> 05:09.073
You sure you don't wanna
come with us this weekend, man?

05:09.177 --> 05:11.217
What? There's no reason for him to come.

05:11.321 --> 05:15.380
You know what, Morris? I think, for the
first time, you and I are on the same page.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.686
I don't know.
Campus tours and scholarship interviews,

05:17.785 --> 05:19.192
sounds like a real blastie-blast.

05:19.289 --> 05:22.388
But I think
I'd rather sock myself in the nuts.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.700
I mean, seriously, look at this thing.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.584
Like, where are all the hotties, you know?
Show some skin.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.056
- Hey.
- Hey!

05:29.081 --> 05:30.903
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Gina.

05:31.513 --> 05:34.230
Kevin, really, just...
Listen, don't take this the wrong way.

05:34.329 --> 05:37.231
But I need to talk to
your friend outside, alone.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.930
Nice!
Does that mean you're gonna

05:39.033 --> 05:41.422
blow him underneath the bleachers?

05:43.129 --> 05:44.689
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

05:44.793 --> 05:47.346
Awesome! You kids have fun! High five!

05:50.553 --> 05:51.633
I got my high five, dude.

05:51.737 --> 05:53.079
Does he give you a high five like that?

05:53.177 --> 05:54.606
See you...

05:54.713 --> 05:56.884
Here's your brochure, though.
Have a good weekend.

05:58.457 --> 05:59.766
Miami?

06:01.081 --> 06:04.147
- When did you apply there?
- A couple months ago.

06:04.729 --> 06:05.777
What about us?

06:05.881 --> 06:07.474
I mean, what about our plans to
go to Fieldmont together?

06:07.577 --> 06:09.748
And the campus tour this weekend?

06:09.849 --> 06:11.605
Just go without me.

06:12.826 --> 06:16.404
Look, it's senior year.

06:17.465 --> 06:22.070
It's, like, so exciting,
and I wanna party, and I wanna have fun.

06:22.170 --> 06:25.814
And you're, like, not fun.

06:28.153 --> 06:31.950
Like, so what? So I don't drink very
much, you know. We still have fun.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.748
Like our Friday nights at mini golf.

06:33.849 --> 06:35.125
Yeah, they're kind of boring.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.778
Our camping trips, the school carnival,
studying together?

06:37.882 --> 06:40.816
Standing around while you're
taking pictures of everything?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.776
- Thrilling!
- Gina...

06:42.873 --> 06:44.182
When we were freshmen, it was one thing.

06:44.281 --> 06:48.591
But this is our time to really go crazy!
We're supposed to be partying.

06:48.698 --> 06:51.731
And you, you're just... You're a loser!

06:54.329 --> 06:55.955
Kevin, it's over.

06:56.441 --> 07:00.947
College is just around the corner,
and I can't let you ruin my senior year.

07:03.450 --> 07:04.879
That's mine.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.571
<i>Okay, so let me get this straight.</i>

07:07.961 --> 07:11.277
You didn't get blown under the bleachers?

07:11.386 --> 07:14.768
No! Dude, have you been listening to me?
She dumped me!

07:14.874 --> 07:16.783
I was dumped once.

07:16.890 --> 07:18.678
Morris, you're such a fucking liar, dude.

07:18.777 --> 07:21.460
- You've never even had a girlfriend.
- Shut up, Carter. Yes, I did.

07:21.561 --> 07:23.383
Remember, Kev?
You introduced me to her.

07:23.481 --> 07:24.593
- Right.
- She was real.

07:24.697 --> 07:28.112
- We went to physics camp together.
- Maybe more like fantasy camp.

07:28.217 --> 07:30.486
Come on, you guys. Do you mind?
I'm having a breakdown here.

07:30.586 --> 07:31.862
What am I supposed to do now?

07:31.961 --> 07:34.197
It was all set.
First, we'd go to college together,

07:34.297 --> 07:37.396
and then we'd get married,
have a couple kids, one girl, one boy.

07:37.497 --> 07:40.880
Dude, is that the kind of shit
you would say to Gina?

07:40.985 --> 07:43.833
God! No wonder she dumped your ass.
You're fucking lame.

07:44.473 --> 07:47.124
- What's up, fellows?
- What's up, Fletcher?

07:48.122 --> 07:49.234
What's up with Negative Nancy over here?

07:49.337 --> 07:51.125
Gina dumped him.
He's having a breakdown.

07:51.225 --> 07:54.935
Cool. So are you guys going on some sort
of road trip to Fieldmont this weekend?

07:55.033 --> 07:57.237
- I don't think I'm going anymore.
- That's too bad.

07:57.337 --> 07:59.759
I just went there last weekend
to visit my bro.

07:59.865 --> 08:00.880
I almost didn't make it back.

08:00.985 --> 08:03.636
"Almost didn't make it back"?
Dude, it's just college.

08:03.737 --> 08:05.875
Yeah, yeah, just college.
Yeah, see, that's what I thought, too.

08:05.977 --> 08:08.311
And then I went,
and I'm telling you guys right now,

08:08.409 --> 08:11.606
it is fucking nuts, man. It's retarded.

08:12.281 --> 08:14.103
Why? What happened?

08:14.201 --> 08:16.143
You guys want to know?

08:17.049 --> 08:18.991
Basically, this is how it went down.

08:19.097 --> 08:20.591
I didn't sleep for three days, okay?

08:20.697 --> 08:22.006
I don't have any money left
in my bank account.

08:22.105 --> 08:23.218
I maxed out my parents' credit card,

08:23.321 --> 08:25.263
which was only supposed
to be used in case of an emergency.

08:25.369 --> 08:27.343
I lost my cell phone,
which is actually my dad's cell phone.

08:27.449 --> 08:29.009
So he's pissed about that
and the credit card.

08:29.113 --> 08:32.113
I tried smoking a tampon,
which I thought was a big fat joint.

08:32.217 --> 08:34.836
Still got high. Stole a car,
got in a bar fight, ate some goldfish.

08:34.937 --> 08:37.359
Played naked Frisbee, did some whip-its,
wet my brother's bed twice.

08:37.465 --> 08:38.414
Shit my pants, once,

08:38.520 --> 08:41.009
but please don't tell anyone,
'cause I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

08:41.113 --> 08:44.692
Saw two girls make out.
With tongue! With tongue!

08:44.825 --> 08:46.996
Watched my brother's roommates
eat as many cheeseburgers as they could

08:47.097 --> 08:48.045
until one of them puked.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.975
Found a tattoo on my lower back
of a unicorn.

08:50.073 --> 08:51.055
Don't remember getting that.

08:51.161 --> 08:53.016
Figure I'll just tell people
it's some sort of killer unicorn.

08:53.113 --> 08:54.258
You know? So it doesn't seem so gay.

08:54.362 --> 08:56.817
I laughed. I cried. Fell in love.

08:57.529 --> 09:00.693
Yeah, and did I mention earlier
that I got laid?

09:00.793 --> 09:03.510
Three times. Different girls, yeah.

09:03.609 --> 09:07.537
So all in all, I'd say it was pretty much
the best weekend of my fucking life.

09:07.641 --> 09:08.754
Yeah.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.350
Dude, you should go.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.756
What if I could have a weekend like that,
a weekend like Fletcher's?

09:16.857 --> 09:20.118
How? No way.
Who knows if he's even telling the truth?

09:20.249 --> 09:22.224
Come on, man. What if he was?
You heard him.

09:22.329 --> 09:26.999
All the craziness, the partying, the sex,
the drinking, it sounds incredible.

09:28.153 --> 09:30.063
You know, maybe I'll even get a tattoo.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.820
Wait, you're joking, right?

09:33.113 --> 09:37.554
You got me, Kev. That's a good one.
Partying, drinking, sex. Up top.

09:37.657 --> 09:41.454
I'm not kidding, Morris.
You know, maybe Gina's right, I'm no fun.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.797
A weekend like Fletcher's
is exactly what I need.

09:43.897 --> 09:47.639
Kev, having some crazy weekend
to get back at Gina is a really bad idea.

09:47.737 --> 09:50.584
Or a really good idea,
and I say go for it.

09:53.785 --> 09:54.962
Bitch.

09:55.801 --> 09:56.750
You know what? I'm gonna go for it.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.646
In fact, I'm gonna have a better weekend
than Fletcher.

09:58.745 --> 09:59.857
Yes!

10:02.521 --> 10:03.667
Dude, I am so going.

10:04.185 --> 10:06.902
<i>I gotta move</i>

10:07.001 --> 10:10.929
<i>While the streets ahead are sunny</i>

10:11.033 --> 10:16.052
<i>Fall in love with some honey</i>
<i>Oh, mama</i>

10:16.441 --> 10:19.703
<i>I gotta move</i>

10:21.721 --> 10:26.162
<i>It's time I broke out into the open</i>

10:26.265 --> 10:28.916
<i>You know I'll settle down again some day</i>

10:29.017 --> 10:31.384
Dude, this is definitely better
than the brochure!

10:31.481 --> 10:33.204
Yeah, man,
I've got a good feeling about this.

10:33.305 --> 10:34.352
Good feeling? What kind of good feeling?

10:34.457 --> 10:36.213
Like your-boy-Carter's-gonna-get-laid
kind of feeling?

10:36.313 --> 10:38.648
'Cause I have that feeling too, and I love it!

10:38.745 --> 10:41.080
I don't know, man, just everything.
I'm ready to have fun.

10:41.177 --> 10:43.598
Yeah, man, good!
Positive vibes. Positive vibes.

10:43.705 --> 10:47.960
Okay, Kev, it says here that the campus
tour is at 12:30 tomorrow afternoon.

10:48.057 --> 10:51.951
And there's a pre-frosh reception tonight
before dinner in the main...

10:52.057 --> 10:54.359
Okay, that's enough!
That is enough. No more.

10:54.457 --> 10:55.439
That's our schedule for the weekend!

10:55.545 --> 10:58.861
Dude, Morris, fuck schedules, man!
We're in college now.

10:58.969 --> 11:00.692
You know what that means?

11:00.793 --> 11:04.371
No parents! No curfew! Free fucking beer!

11:04.473 --> 11:07.222
It does not get any better than this!

11:08.121 --> 11:10.870
Except for that.
Dude, slow down, slow down.

11:10.969 --> 11:12.944
Hey, what's up, ladies?
You on your way to class?

11:13.049 --> 11:15.351
No. We just like carrying all these books
around for fun.

11:15.449 --> 11:19.224
Right!
A girl's got to read, huh? Awesome.

11:19.321 --> 11:22.136
So, look, we're in town for the weekend,
and we were just kind of wondering

11:22.233 --> 11:24.437
if you guys could, I mean, I don't know,
show us around?

11:24.537 --> 11:26.741
New guys, huh?
What college are you visiting from?

11:26.841 --> 11:29.176
No, no, see, we're not in college.

11:29.273 --> 11:32.569
- We're actually still in high school.
- What the fuck?

11:32.665 --> 11:33.777
- I hate you so much!
- Stop it!

11:33.881 --> 11:35.342
You're crushing my testicles!

11:35.449 --> 11:37.870
- What my friend meant to say was...
- Fuck off!

11:37.977 --> 11:40.627
All righty then. I'll see you guys later.

11:40.729 --> 11:43.860
Hey, green shirt, if I give you $5 right now,

11:43.961 --> 11:46.579
would you fart in a can
and let me just keep it in my bedroom?

11:46.681 --> 11:48.372
I'll never open it! I promise.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.297
These dorms are whack.
Why do we have to stay here?

11:54.393 --> 11:55.636
You don't have to, Carter.

11:55.737 --> 11:58.585
This is where the admissions board
put me and Kevin.

11:58.681 --> 12:01.551
Look, I got a cousin who's a legacy
in one of the fraternities.

12:01.657 --> 12:03.479
I'm sure if we go there, they'll hook us up.

12:03.577 --> 12:06.327
- Yeah, my parents would love that.
- Yeah.

12:06.425 --> 12:10.483
Enough, you guys! Look, I don't see
what's so bad about this, Carter.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.613
- What?
- God!

12:21.016 --> 12:22.478
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

12:22.617 --> 12:23.664
I'm Morris.

12:24.504 --> 12:27.571
I'm Kevin, Kevin Brewer,
prospective freshman.

12:27.673 --> 12:30.062
We're supposed to be staying in your room
this weekend.

12:30.169 --> 12:31.543
Right.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.662
Look, fellows, I'm gonna need about
20, 30 minutes to finish up here, okay?

12:36.761 --> 12:38.834
So just come back later.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.275
Probably just working out.

12:44.377 --> 12:47.126
Yeah, he's just working out one of these.

12:50.713 --> 12:52.437
- Disgusting!
- How's that frat house sound, guys?

12:52.537 --> 12:53.584
Pretty good? Awesome.

12:59.801 --> 13:01.394
Okay, dude, do you actually know
where you're going?

13:01.497 --> 13:04.431
Dude, relax! It's right up here, I think.

13:05.113 --> 13:06.323
All right, dude, I'm not perfect, all right?

13:06.425 --> 13:08.018
All these Greek letters
look the same to me.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.647
Maybe we should go back
and try the dorm again.

13:09.753 --> 13:12.175
You shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!

13:12.281 --> 13:13.459
Or not. That's cool, too.

13:18.745 --> 13:23.153
Holy shit. Those chicks
definitely weren't in the brochure.

13:23.257 --> 13:24.818
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.632
- What's up, college girls?
- Ladies.

13:27.737 --> 13:30.225
- I'm Morris.
- Hi, Morris.

13:30.937 --> 13:34.614
- She said my name.
- Chicks are smoking hot! Yeah.

13:36.665 --> 13:40.112
"Chicks are smoking hot"?
Come on, real smooth, Carter.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.862
Yeah. Smooth.

13:43.961 --> 13:45.455
Whatever! All you got out was your name.

13:45.561 --> 13:47.055
Which she repeated back to me,
I'd like to note.

13:47.161 --> 13:48.089
Shut up.

13:53.113 --> 13:54.062
Jesus!

13:54.169 --> 13:56.241
- Nut shot.
- Ten points!

13:56.345 --> 13:57.589
Get some.

13:58.073 --> 13:59.862
Shitty news, dudes.

14:00.825 --> 14:04.469
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

14:04.569 --> 14:05.681
Shit!

14:06.137 --> 14:09.617
I guess he's taking that whole
singing thing pretty seriously.

14:09.721 --> 14:11.477
Looking good, Goose.

14:11.577 --> 14:14.838
Looks like we got another semester
without any pledges.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.726
This fucking blows, man!

14:16.824 --> 14:20.207
What's the point of college
if you can't have pledges?

14:20.312 --> 14:21.425
Shit!

14:23.544 --> 14:24.689
Fuck!

14:26.361 --> 14:27.441
Fuck!

14:29.881 --> 14:31.288
Son of a...

14:34.297 --> 14:36.599
That's it.
This just might be the year to graduate.

14:36.697 --> 14:37.744
- What?
- What?

14:37.848 --> 14:39.604
- No.
- Yeah, I didn't think it'd come so soon.

14:39.705 --> 14:42.258
You can't graduate. You're Bearcat.

14:42.361 --> 14:44.248
- You're an institution.
- I know.

14:44.345 --> 14:46.254
I'm scared to graduate.

14:46.361 --> 14:49.460
It seems like torturing pledges,
that's all I'm good at.

14:49.561 --> 14:51.732
That's not true, and you know that.

14:51.833 --> 14:55.924
You're good at a lot of things.
Cooper, tell him what he's good at.

14:56.985 --> 15:00.597
Like... Like the keg toss.

15:01.785 --> 15:03.673
And you take the biggest dumps
in the house. Right?

15:03.768 --> 15:07.347
Yeah. Nobody beats you at that.
It's like a real gift.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.831
It is, isn't it?
Thanks, guys. I feel a lot better.

15:11.704 --> 15:13.777
- Hang in there, big guy.
- You're all right.

15:13.881 --> 15:15.342
Hang in there.

15:19.641 --> 15:22.870
We'll figure this whole pledge thing out,
I promise.

15:34.873 --> 15:37.459
Hey, man, is this the Beta Phi house?

15:37.561 --> 15:39.700
What? You can't read Greek?

15:39.801 --> 15:41.743
My cousin is a legacy here.

15:41.849 --> 15:44.086
- Yeah? Who's your cousin?
- Toby Scott.

15:44.184 --> 15:45.678
You mean Queef?

15:47.064 --> 15:48.591
- What?
- Queef.

15:49.401 --> 15:51.735
- What's a queef?
- A pussy fart.

15:52.441 --> 15:53.967
It's his pledge name.

15:54.073 --> 15:56.495
- Who'd want that name?
- Yeah, he earned it.

15:56.601 --> 16:01.205
I'd like to help you guys out, with you
being his cousin and everything, but...

16:02.713 --> 16:03.825
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:03.929 --> 16:06.417
Come on, man.
Look, we're in high school, you know?

16:06.520 --> 16:09.422
We're just up here to party, you know?
Is that too much to ask?

16:09.529 --> 16:12.791
You guys are a bunch of high school kids?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.993
No, okay? Go try the dorms.

16:18.392 --> 16:20.814
- A legacy, dude?
- Yeah, he's... I...

16:20.920 --> 16:23.855
I can't believe they call Toby "Queef."
Toby kicks ass.

16:26.776 --> 16:27.823
What did those guys want?

16:27.929 --> 16:32.020
A couple of high school kids
looking to crash here for the weekend.

16:32.536 --> 16:34.838
One of them was Queef's cousin.
Remember him?

16:34.937 --> 16:38.963
God, that guy could toss a salad.
That thing he did with his tongue?

16:39.928 --> 16:42.001
Sorry. That guy's a loser.

16:42.105 --> 16:45.104
So, they're looking
for a place to crash, huh?

16:47.129 --> 16:49.649
- Maybe we should let them stay.
- What, are you serious?

16:49.753 --> 16:50.735
What the hell
are we gonna do with a bunch

16:50.840 --> 16:53.623
of fucking high school kids
here all weekend?

16:56.281 --> 16:58.518
Brothers.
- Do it, man!

16:59.001 --> 17:00.910
- Listen up.
- Boner.

17:01.017 --> 17:02.991
Goose, shut the fuck up.

17:05.496 --> 17:07.733
These guys. What's your names?

17:08.281 --> 17:10.037
I'm Kevin, and this is Morris and Carter.

17:10.136 --> 17:12.656
Okay, whatever. These guys are
our guests for the weekend.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.790
Well, see, technically,
we're supposed to stay in the dorms,

17:16.888 --> 17:18.830
but our roommate's a little...

17:18.935 --> 17:20.146
Technically, you're a fag!
...preoccupied.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.623
Yeah, he's jerking off.

17:21.721 --> 17:24.339
Pussy! Fuck hole!
Did we say you could talk?

17:24.440 --> 17:28.085
Bearcat! Relax, big man.
They didn't mean anything by it.

17:29.913 --> 17:32.662
Sorry. He's got anger management issues.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.616
How about I show you guys
where you are staying?

17:34.713 --> 17:36.022
Put your stuff away?

17:36.121 --> 17:37.779
- Morris, do you like the sound of that?
- Party!

17:37.880 --> 17:39.985
Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

17:40.088 --> 17:42.063
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

17:42.168 --> 17:44.110
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

17:44.217 --> 17:45.940
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

17:46.841 --> 17:47.921
What's up, shit face?

17:48.024 --> 17:50.774
This is usually
where we let our pledges stay.

17:50.873 --> 17:55.695
We call this room the dungeon,
but don't let the name scare you.

17:57.145 --> 17:58.967
You're gonna love it.

18:04.377 --> 18:05.871
Watch the step.

18:22.328 --> 18:24.368
Yeah, this place fucking sucks.

18:24.472 --> 18:26.709
Dude, it beats some guy jerking, all right?

18:26.809 --> 18:30.005
Like we said, all of our guest rooms
are taken tonight.

18:30.105 --> 18:33.072
Yeah. We feel really bad
about having to put you guys down here.

18:33.177 --> 18:36.559
- Is that a rat?
- A rat? No. Probably just a shadow.

18:36.665 --> 18:38.192
And don't you guys worry.

18:38.296 --> 18:41.078
We're gonna give you the 411
on all the great parties this weekend.

18:41.176 --> 18:45.399
In fact, I think that the Lambdas
are having a kegger tonight.

18:45.497 --> 18:47.886
Keggers? We love keggers.
Right, Kev? Keggers, keggers!

18:47.993 --> 18:49.335
We are all about keggers.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.596
Cool. Well, you guys
are gonna love the Lambdas.

18:58.201 --> 18:59.445
Bearcat!

19:01.785 --> 19:03.694
- What the fuck is up with that...
- Are you talking?

19:03.801 --> 19:07.216
- No, man. I'm chilling. What?
- Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

19:11.385 --> 19:12.792
So excited!

19:12.889 --> 19:16.402
All right, guys. This is it. Party time.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.284
Let's do the rundown. Rubbers?

19:20.377 --> 19:21.489
Check.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.218
Breath mints?

19:26.552 --> 19:27.796
Check.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.206
Retainers?

19:32.472 --> 19:35.821
I was kidding. That's so fucking gross.
Put that away.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.361
- So, you guys sure about this?
- Relax, man. It's just a frat party.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.309
What?

19:43.417 --> 19:45.719
What? We're here to learn
about college, right?

19:45.816 --> 19:47.988
God, I love the new attitude, Kevin.
It looks good on you, man.

19:48.088 --> 19:49.746
It makes your eyes pop
and your hair shine.

19:49.848 --> 19:53.394
It makes your shirt look better.
Good times. Good times. All right, guys.

19:53.496 --> 19:57.271
Hold onto your socks,
because this is going to be awesome.

19:59.768 --> 20:02.998
Hey, guys! Come on in!
The kegs are full and the Jacuzzi's hot!

20:03.096 --> 20:04.176
Yeah!

20:04.793 --> 20:05.905
Party!

20:06.488 --> 20:07.601
Yeah!

20:08.856 --> 20:12.501
What's up? Going on? Ladies?

20:17.017 --> 20:18.773
There's a lot of dudes here, right?

20:18.873 --> 20:21.207
Yeah. It's a total sausage fest.

20:22.969 --> 20:23.896
Check it out!

20:23.993 --> 20:27.375
These guys are so drunk
they're making out with each other.

20:27.481 --> 20:28.790
Morris, I don't think they're drunk.

20:28.889 --> 20:31.158
Who wants to play
glow-in-the-dark boners now?

20:32.313 --> 20:34.768
It's boner tag! It's boner tag!

20:41.625 --> 20:45.553
Why would they send us
to an all-gay fraternity? Do we look gay?

20:45.657 --> 20:49.813
Maybe they found out how many times
you've been laid and just assumed.

20:49.913 --> 20:51.025
Real funny, Carter.

20:51.128 --> 20:55.568
Look, my cousin's a legacy. I doubt
they're gonna do that to us on purpose.

20:56.504 --> 21:00.082
Don't worry!
That was not full of my piss or anything.

21:01.369 --> 21:02.994
Just Bearcat's.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.144
Yeah!

21:04.249 --> 21:06.867
Hey, how was the party?
Did you guys find any dates?

21:06.968 --> 21:08.856
Yeah, real funny, guys.
We almost got jumped back there.

21:08.953 --> 21:11.855
Watch your step, pre-frosh!
This ain't high school!

21:11.960 --> 21:14.578
Welcome to college, boys. Enjoy.

21:17.337 --> 21:18.264
Crap.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.325
<i>Don't talk about it</i>

21:22.424 --> 21:26.166
<i>Oh, boy, don't talk about it</i>

21:26.264 --> 21:29.941
<i>If you do, I'll die</i>

21:37.080 --> 21:38.869
Holy shit! This is insane!

21:38.969 --> 21:41.587
No, man. This is fucking college.

21:45.048 --> 21:47.568
God bless America for such a place!

21:48.504 --> 21:50.359
Let's rock this bitch.

21:58.425 --> 22:01.174
Hey! Hey! Hey! What's up, fellows?

22:01.816 --> 22:05.645
Look, we feel like absolute shit
for what happened earlier.

22:05.753 --> 22:09.943
- Yeah. We think you guys are cool.
- Yeah. It was just a joke.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.172
We weren't trying to be
like assholes or anything.

22:13.816 --> 22:14.765
Let us make it up to you.

22:14.872 --> 22:16.247
We're gonna go do some body shots.

22:16.344 --> 22:19.344
And we would love it
if you guys would come with us.

22:19.448 --> 22:20.855
Dude, we are so down!

22:20.953 --> 22:23.374
Actually, you know what?
I just filled up, so I'm cool.

22:23.481 --> 22:26.066
Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a pass, too.

22:27.192 --> 22:29.581
Lame and lamer.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.510
Just saying, man, I guess Gina was right.

22:37.177 --> 22:38.486
Dude, where's the bathroom?

22:38.585 --> 22:41.967
All right. All right, you know what?
Fuck it! I'm in.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.229
- Bottle.
- This is awesome.

22:51.448 --> 22:52.626
Salt.

22:55.673 --> 22:56.850
Limes.

22:59.896 --> 23:01.205
And lube.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.270
- What the hell is that for?
-  Just in case.

23:04.376 --> 23:08.816
We probably won't need it. You guys...
You guys are gonna love this.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.807
Where did the girls go?

23:10.904 --> 23:11.832
Unfortunately,

23:13.112 --> 23:14.486
the girls had to go home early.

23:15.768 --> 23:18.452
So who are we doing body shots off of?

23:18.553 --> 23:21.455
- Great question, Mike.
- Morris.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.789
Bearcat was nice enough
to take their place.

23:24.888 --> 23:26.262
Bearcat?

23:29.112 --> 23:30.061
Yeah!

23:43.417 --> 23:45.173
That's right, motherfuckers!

23:45.272 --> 23:47.127
- Okay, we're outta here, let's go.
- Yeah.

23:47.224 --> 23:48.369
Where are you guys going?

23:48.473 --> 23:52.597
Yeah, we thought you guys were cool.
We thought you wanted to party.

23:52.696 --> 23:54.354
Guess we were wrong.

23:54.456 --> 23:58.100
Well, have fun back at the dorm,
you fucking pussies.

24:50.008 --> 24:52.245
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

24:52.344 --> 24:54.613
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

24:54.713 --> 24:57.079
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

24:57.624 --> 24:58.933
Do that shot!
- Yeah!

24:59.032 --> 25:00.461
Do that shot! Do it!

25:04.088 --> 25:05.495
Watch this!

25:18.744 --> 25:20.566
You are my best friend!

25:20.664 --> 25:23.119
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

25:23.224 --> 25:24.336
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

25:24.440 --> 25:26.066
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

25:26.168 --> 25:28.721
Everything's spinning around me.
I'm drunk right now.

25:28.824 --> 25:32.173
Doing shots of tequila out of
some guy's ass crack will do that to you.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.647
Whatever, man. You guys
are lightweights. I don't feel shit!

25:34.744 --> 25:36.271
Is that a fat joke, you bitch?

25:36.376 --> 25:38.198
- Here! Video me!
- Okay.

25:39.928 --> 25:42.776
Yeah, wait till Gina sees this! Party!

25:47.480 --> 25:49.367
Party!

25:55.224 --> 25:57.199
<i>Pump up your fist</i>
<i>If you twist like this</i>

25:57.304 --> 25:58.417
<i>Till the lights go out</i>

25:58.520 --> 25:59.698
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

26:01.015 --> 26:02.902
<i>Katie</i>

26:02.999 --> 26:05.650
<i>I don't know why I even try</i>

26:05.752 --> 26:07.857
<i>'Cause lately</i>

26:07.959 --> 26:10.447
<i>You're always out with other guys</i>

26:10.552 --> 26:12.886
<i>Pretty baby</i>

26:12.984 --> 26:15.373
<i>Don't you know I'll treat you right</i>

26:15.479 --> 26:17.868
<i>I'll go crazy</i>

26:17.975 --> 26:21.107
<i>If you pass me up tonight</i>

26:21.368 --> 26:23.669
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

26:23.767 --> 26:26.004
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

26:26.103 --> 26:28.438
<i>All this time can't get it off my mind</i>

26:28.535 --> 26:30.096
<i>Dance the night away</i>

26:30.199 --> 26:31.127
<i>Keep rocking with me</i>

26:31.224 --> 26:33.395
<i>When the grooves all right</i>
<i>Rocking all night</i>

26:33.496 --> 26:35.470
<i>I want to hear you say</i>

26:35.799 --> 26:38.221
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

26:38.327 --> 26:39.571
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

26:39.671 --> 26:40.915
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

26:41.015 --> 26:43.219
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

26:43.319 --> 26:44.813
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

26:44.920 --> 26:45.934
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

26:46.039 --> 26:47.827
<i>Pump up your fist</i>
<i>If you twist like this</i>

26:49.593 --> 26:50.095
<i>Till the lights go out</i>

26:50.201 --> 26:51.129
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

26:51.225 --> 26:52.851
<i>Wake up</i>

26:52.954 --> 26:55.507
<i>I'm calling you up</i>
<i>I need a ride</i>

26:55.609 --> 26:57.649
<i>We're gonna shake up</i>

26:57.754 --> 27:00.372
<i>So hurry it up, no wasted time</i>

27:00.473 --> 27:03.408
<i>The girls in their makeup</i>
<i>In black and white</i>

27:03.514 --> 27:05.652
<i>Exchanging looks tonight</i>

27:05.753 --> 27:08.502
<i>I just ran into some other friends of mine</i>

27:08.601 --> 27:10.936
<i>Someone's coming round</i>
<i>To pick them up at nine</i>

27:11.033 --> 27:13.455
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

27:13.561 --> 27:14.510
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

27:14.617 --> 27:16.079
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

27:17.689 --> 27:18.638
Fuck yeah!

27:29.847 --> 27:31.057
Drink!

27:32.535 --> 27:35.569
- Sorry. What?
- I made the shot. Now you drink.

27:35.671 --> 27:38.127
Yeah, yeah, right. Cool. All right.

27:42.775 --> 27:45.361
- So when do I get a turn?
- When I miss.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.690
You kids having fun?

27:50.647 --> 27:52.752
What? I can't play?

27:54.424 --> 27:58.864
What do you say we wrap up this game
and bring it up to my room?

27:59.383 --> 28:00.659
Minus the dickhead.

28:00.759 --> 28:02.701
Yeah. I think I'll pass.

28:07.927 --> 28:10.774
Could I get the beer? No?
Later? Well, okay.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.446
- What an a-hole.
- Tell me about it.

28:14.871 --> 28:16.693
Anyway, where were we?

28:18.935 --> 28:20.080
Nice.

28:22.455 --> 28:25.303
Nitrous in the hizzie!
Who wants a balloon?

28:27.575 --> 28:29.942
Granola Bar! Can I have one, please?

28:30.039 --> 28:32.144
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The lady needs a balloon.

28:32.247 --> 28:34.003
There you go, darling,
that one's just for you.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.045
- I'm gonna sit.
- All right.

28:39.703 --> 28:43.500
Hey, here you go. Have a balloon.

28:43.607 --> 28:46.290
This balloon's for you! Have a balloon!

28:47.863 --> 28:49.140
No, no.

28:50.199 --> 28:54.672
You have to inhale it.
It makes chicks crazy horny, like her.

28:55.095 --> 28:56.273
Wow.

28:59.895 --> 29:01.586
Feel the flow.

29:05.335 --> 29:09.841
Hey, I saw a laundry room back there.
You want to go make out or something?

29:10.391 --> 29:13.173
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?
- Yeah.

29:13.271 --> 29:17.046
I haven't heard a line like that since,
like, high school. Later.

29:17.975 --> 29:19.764
You've got flat tits!

29:20.759 --> 29:21.904
Do you mind?

29:22.007 --> 29:25.651
What? Yeah, absolutely.
Have a... Have a sip.

29:28.279 --> 29:31.279
Or down the whole thing.
That's cool. Whatever.

29:39.511 --> 29:42.740
I'm so getting laid.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

29:43.127 --> 29:44.588
Excuse me. Excuse me!

29:44.695 --> 29:46.255
What's up? How's it going?

29:46.359 --> 29:48.628
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

29:48.727 --> 29:50.549
You're bigger than me.
Excuse me! Excuse me!

30:00.375 --> 30:01.968
This is awesome!

30:12.727 --> 30:14.832
Wait. What was that?

30:16.887 --> 30:19.123
Shit! I think someone's coming.

30:22.423 --> 30:23.437
- No, no, no. The bed, the bed!
- What?

30:23.543 --> 30:24.590
- I'm not gonna fit under there!
- You'll fit!

30:24.695 --> 30:27.378
- I will not fit under this bed.
- Get under!

30:32.096 --> 30:34.006
Are you sure this room's okay?

30:34.112 --> 30:37.560
It's fine. Relax, okay?
Everyone's downstairs.

30:37.952 --> 30:40.221
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

30:40.609 --> 30:43.805
I'm just a little nervous, you know?
I've never really been with a girl before.

30:44.224 --> 30:48.567
Don't worry.
I'll be gentle. I promise.

31:04.992 --> 31:07.992
Morris, maybe it's because
I'm really high right now,

31:08.097 --> 31:10.268
but I will just go for this.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.671
Go for what? You want another...

31:23.105 --> 31:27.066
Sorry. Your hand is down my pants.

31:27.168 --> 31:28.991
I know. Just relax.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.549
Sweet!

31:32.801 --> 31:35.452
Oh, God! That feels so good!

31:36.193 --> 31:39.641
- Your hands are like butter!
- Are like butter.

31:40.864 --> 31:44.028
You know, normally,
I'd be doing this to myself,

31:44.704 --> 31:46.941
but this is way better.

31:47.041 --> 31:50.302
Plus, I don't have to worry
about my mom walking in, and...

31:56.729 --> 31:59.096
Heather? Hello?

32:01.304 --> 32:03.312
Damn it! So close!

32:05.443 --> 32:06.653
Cop!

32:08.419 --> 32:09.728
- What's your problem?
- Hey, come on.

32:09.826 --> 32:11.485
- Run!
- Who is that?

32:13.570 --> 32:16.221
Party's busted! Everybody run!

32:20.642 --> 32:21.952
That sucks.

32:29.762 --> 32:31.136
That feels so good.

32:31.234 --> 32:33.885
I almost forgot.
- You carry that with you?

32:33.987 --> 32:36.125
They don't call it
a pocket rocket for nothing.

32:41.923 --> 32:43.297
You got it?

32:44.195 --> 32:46.561
Yeah. I got it. Where were we?

32:52.835 --> 32:55.201
I didn't know you were so kinky.

33:00.194 --> 33:01.307
Yeah!

33:02.243 --> 33:04.152
Kiss me. Kiss me now.

33:04.259 --> 33:06.397
Really?
- Kiss me!

33:06.498 --> 33:08.156
Do it!

33:08.258 --> 33:10.811
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

33:10.914 --> 33:13.303
Are you sure?
- Yeah. Just relax.

33:13.890 --> 33:16.225
What the fuck do you know
about welfare reform?

33:16.322 --> 33:18.711
Come on down and check it out.

33:30.946 --> 33:35.256
So, I don't really know what this means,

33:36.451 --> 33:40.509
but Amy says that she's under the bed
with your friend Carter.

33:42.978 --> 33:45.182
- Should I be worried?
- Yeah, definitely.

33:45.283 --> 33:46.744
Okay.

33:46.851 --> 33:49.600
Wait a second.
Why aren't they on top of the bed?

33:49.698 --> 33:51.585
That's a good question.

33:54.114 --> 33:56.831
So what are you guys? Freshmen?

33:58.627 --> 34:01.344
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're freshmen. Yep.

34:01.442 --> 34:03.035
What's your major?

34:03.138 --> 34:04.927
Uh...

34:05.026 --> 34:07.393
- Photography.
- Really?

34:08.098 --> 34:12.408
I love photography.
I really suck, but that's cool.

34:12.514 --> 34:14.172
I heard they have
a really great program here.

34:14.274 --> 34:16.728
Yeah. It's supposed to be
one of the best in the country.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.322
Maybe you can give me
a lesson sometime.

34:19.426 --> 34:20.888
Yeah, sure.

34:25.538 --> 34:26.967
That was so hot.

34:27.074 --> 34:28.668
Please tell me you're as horny
as I am right now.

34:28.770 --> 34:29.719
- Hornier.
- Good.

34:29.826 --> 34:30.971
What's up, man?

34:31.074 --> 34:34.849
Wow, motherfucker,
I can't believe we did that shit last night.

34:48.514 --> 34:49.888
What the...

34:51.458 --> 34:53.214
Christmas came early!

35:05.218 --> 35:08.350
- Here we are.
- Yep. Here we are.

35:09.474 --> 35:12.408
You know, you're different
than most college guys.

35:12.514 --> 35:16.158
Well, you know,
I don't even really feel like a college guy.

35:16.930 --> 35:19.712
Yeah. I could tell.
But it's a good thing.

35:24.482 --> 35:26.849
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

35:27.714 --> 35:29.950
- I hope so.
- Okay. Bye.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.643
<i>In the night sky</i>

35:33.186 --> 35:36.088
<i>In the night sky</i>

35:37.155 --> 35:39.969
<i>In the night sky</i>

35:45.058 --> 35:49.597
<i>In the night sky</i>
<i>It used to be home</i>

35:52.515 --> 35:54.271
- Kevin!
- Jesus, what?

35:55.395 --> 35:56.704
What do you want?

36:27.266 --> 36:30.266
Morris. Wake up, sleepy.

36:38.658 --> 36:41.243
Holy shit. Did we...

36:41.346 --> 36:43.582
Heck, yeah! All night long.

36:44.738 --> 36:46.080
Give it to me again, big boy!

36:46.178 --> 36:48.698
This is the greatest day of my life.

36:50.658 --> 36:54.204
Hey, Dad. Dad! What are you doing here?

36:54.306 --> 36:59.456
You missed your interview, Morris.
You blew it, the scholarship, Fieldmont,

37:00.738 --> 37:02.112
everything.

37:11.618 --> 37:12.796
Shit!

37:15.906 --> 37:17.499
The interview!

37:27.746 --> 37:28.990
<i>Give it up</i>

37:32.098 --> 37:33.342
<i>Give it up</i>

37:36.482 --> 37:37.726
<i>Give it up</i>

37:40.866 --> 37:41.814
<i>Give it up</i>

37:48.034 --> 37:50.522
Apparently, Mr. Hooper's a no-show.

37:55.010 --> 37:56.384
Thank God!

37:57.506 --> 38:00.288
You're still here. I'm sorry I'm late.

38:04.866 --> 38:09.503
Now, behind me is the bronze statue
of a revolutionary war hero,

38:09.602 --> 38:11.773
General W.S. Fieldmont.

38:11.874 --> 38:15.518
It has become one of
the most sacred landmarks of our time.

38:17.602 --> 38:21.279
My life is over.
My parents are gonna disown me.

38:21.378 --> 38:26.047
- Dude, they probably didn't even notice.
- Didn't notice? Did you see my face?

38:27.394 --> 38:30.263
Yeah, dude, I did.
That shit was so funny.

38:30.370 --> 38:33.850
Whatever, dude. Just kiss
the scholarship bye-bye and move on.

38:33.954 --> 38:35.295
And where the hell is Kevin, by the way?

38:35.394 --> 38:37.761
You know, he should've been here by now.
This is his campus tour.

38:37.858 --> 38:41.567
He probably just hooked up last night.
At least someone did.

38:42.498 --> 38:44.538
You don't think
something happened to him, do you?

38:44.642 --> 38:48.090
Dude, it's college.
What could possibly happen to him?

39:08.610 --> 39:12.866
Looking good, Kev.
A lot hairier than I thought you'd be.

39:18.370 --> 39:20.606
- Check it out.
- Hey!

39:20.706 --> 39:23.226
- Nice diaper!
- Looking good, buddy!

39:27.138 --> 39:29.342
Okay. This is really embarrassing.

39:29.442 --> 39:31.743
Yeah, it's not really
the highlight of my day either, Carter.

39:31.842 --> 39:33.052
Why would they do this to you?

39:33.154 --> 39:37.758
I don't know. Because they can, I guess.
There's some clothes in my car. Try...

39:45.986 --> 39:47.196
Maybe we should just go home.

39:47.298 --> 39:48.956
We're not going anywhere, all right?
Not yet.

39:49.058 --> 39:51.360
Why not? What are you trying to prove?

39:51.457 --> 39:54.774
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to have fun.

39:54.882 --> 39:57.435
Amen to that! God, I love the new Kevin!

39:57.538 --> 39:59.163
You call this having a good time?

39:59.266 --> 40:02.528
I'll get back at them.
It could have been worse.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.375
What could be worse than getting
duct-taped naked to a statue all night?

40:05.698 --> 40:09.047
<i>Hey, what's up, Gina?</i>
<i>It's that boring guy you dumped!</i>

40:09.154 --> 40:10.812
<i>Fieldmont rocks!</i>

40:21.026 --> 40:22.880
Dude, maybe the message
didn't even send.

40:22.978 --> 40:25.499
You know what?
Whatever, I'm kind of hoping it did.

40:25.602 --> 40:28.864
Really? Well, in that case,
let's do like a whole Kevin party series.

40:28.962 --> 40:30.685
- We'll post it online...
- Yeah, dude, don't push it.

40:30.786 --> 40:31.898
Okay.

40:34.657 --> 40:37.210
Come on, Morris.
Being stuck here isn't the worst thing.

40:37.314 --> 40:39.703
You know, I mean,
it's probably for the best.

40:39.810 --> 40:40.955
How's it for the best?

40:41.058 --> 40:43.360
Because if you went home now,
you know exactly what would happen.

40:43.458 --> 40:46.774
Yeah! Your parents would go ape-shit
on your ass for blowing the big interview.

40:46.882 --> 40:49.184
And now at least you could probably talk
to that Dean Chandler guy.

40:49.282 --> 40:51.191
You know, explain what happened.

40:51.298 --> 40:52.923
You really think that would work?

40:53.026 --> 40:55.131
I think it's worth a shot.
What do you have to lose?

40:55.234 --> 40:56.346
And you may see that Heather chick again

40:56.450 --> 40:58.871
and get more than a half hand job.

41:00.577 --> 41:02.814
I think he'll definitely see her again.

41:06.241 --> 41:07.583
Yeah.

41:33.058 --> 41:37.848
By the way, I sort of accidentally
told Kendall we were in college last night.

41:46.558 --> 41:48.598
Looks like those high school fuckers
aren't as stupid as we thought.

41:48.703 --> 41:50.558
They got front row seats to nipple city.

41:55.967 --> 41:58.203
Motherfuckers!

41:59.679 --> 42:01.589
It's part of the whole
sorority experience.

42:01.695 --> 42:05.110
Fraternities throw parties,
and we have charity events.

42:05.215 --> 42:07.003
Nice! Are any of them naked?

42:08.159 --> 42:11.126
All right, bitches, you're up!
This isn't social hour!

42:11.231 --> 42:12.922
So I guess you better go, huh?

42:13.023 --> 42:14.878
Yeah, but maybe if you're lucky,

42:14.975 --> 42:17.593
we'll let you guys buy us
a few beers tonight at Bruno's.

42:17.695 --> 42:19.451
- What's that?
- A bar.

42:19.935 --> 42:22.553
Wait. You guys do go to bars, right?

42:23.679 --> 42:27.421
- Bars? Yeah. All the time.
- Every day. I'm always at the bar.

42:27.967 --> 42:30.356
Just make sure you bring this guy.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.276
- This guy?
- Me?

42:32.382 --> 42:33.593
Yeah, you.

42:33.694 --> 42:37.175
Last night was the first frat party
I actually enjoyed.

42:37.279 --> 42:38.840
Because of me?

42:39.135 --> 42:42.430
- Okay.
- Well, we'll see you guys tonight then.

42:44.351 --> 42:47.515
Hey, I was thinking maybe we could,
you know,

42:47.615 --> 42:49.403
finish what we started last night.

42:49.503 --> 42:52.602
Maybe.
Just try not to pass out on me this time.

42:56.286 --> 42:57.301
God, that girl fucking rocks.

43:01.057 --> 43:02.039
- Kev?
- Yeah?

43:02.144 --> 43:07.960
On a scale of one to ten,
I like boobies at, like, 9,000. Seriously.

43:08.064 --> 43:09.919
What's up, fellows?

43:10.592 --> 43:11.541
Hey, Kevin!

43:11.648 --> 43:15.871
Heard you and the General got a
little cozy last night. Jesus Christ!

43:16.480 --> 43:18.422
Yeah. Yeah, that was a good one, Teague.

43:18.529 --> 43:22.325
Hey, I don't suppose you know
what happened to my car, do you?

43:26.240 --> 43:28.607
- So that's how it's gonna be, Teague?
- That's right, pre-frosh.

43:28.704 --> 43:31.519
In fact, we got a job
for you three douche bags.

43:31.617 --> 43:33.591
What kind of job?

43:33.697 --> 43:37.625
Nothing much. We're just gonna need you
to clean the house for our party tonight.

43:37.728 --> 43:41.852
Maybe wash my car.
You know how I like to keep my ride clean.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.123
Where did I put them keys?

43:54.336 --> 43:57.849
- Fuck that! No!
- Am I sensing some hostility?

43:57.952 --> 43:58.966
Wait, are you guys serious?

43:59.072 --> 44:00.446
Well, you guys didn't think
your room and board

44:00.544 --> 44:01.853
were gonna be free here, did you?

44:01.952 --> 44:03.927
We're not cleaning your house!
No fucking way!

44:04.032 --> 44:06.715
Well, maybe your little girlfriends
over there would like to find out

44:06.816 --> 44:09.085
you guys are still in high school.

44:09.184 --> 44:10.493
How do you know
we didn't already tell them?

44:10.592 --> 44:14.869
Because if you did, they wouldn't be
giving you the time of day, you little dicks.

44:14.977 --> 44:17.278
Better get to work now, boys!

44:17.376 --> 44:19.002
Pick the keys up.

44:22.401 --> 44:23.480
Boom!

44:26.241 --> 44:28.826
And Kevin? Kevy?

44:30.272 --> 44:31.996
Don't waste your time with Kendall.

44:32.096 --> 44:34.268
You don't want my sloppy seconds,
do you?

44:34.368 --> 44:37.664
Unless you're into that?
You fucking sicko! Go inside.

44:43.616 --> 44:46.999
Dude, why do we have to clean?
Don't they got pledges to do this shit?

44:47.104 --> 44:49.952
Dude, I think this weekend
we are the pledges.

45:03.424 --> 45:05.399
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

45:09.824 --> 45:11.929
<i>I'm down on my luck</i>
<i>I'm out on the streets</i>

45:12.032 --> 45:14.366
<i>I'm at wit's end</i>
<i>I've nearly been beat</i>

45:14.464 --> 45:17.333
<i>See they've taken my home</i>
<i>They've taken my wife</i>

45:17.440 --> 45:19.644
<i>They've taken my job</i>
<i>And they've taken my life</i>

45:19.744 --> 45:22.265
<i>But there's one thing</i>
<i>That they will not take</i>

45:22.368 --> 45:24.987
<i>That I will hold till the end</i>
<i>Until my dying day</i>

45:25.088 --> 45:27.609
<i>'Cause it's part of me</i>
<i>And it's time that we say</i>

45:27.712 --> 45:30.614
<i>They will not take it all away!</i>

45:45.152 --> 45:46.941
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

45:50.369 --> 45:52.278
<i>It's getting harder every day</i>

45:55.616 --> 45:57.526
<i>Brothers, sisters, hear me say</i>

46:01.472 --> 46:04.189
<i>I'm pounding the pavement</i>
<i>Through thick and thin</i>

46:04.288 --> 46:06.557
<i>Good times and bad</i>
<i>I just can't win</i>

46:06.656 --> 46:09.503
<i>I've been beat on, kicked on</i>
<i>Insulted to my face</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:11.804
<i>The whole bleeding world thinks</i>
<i>I'm a bleeding disgrace</i>

46:11.904 --> 46:14.751
<i>Yeah, they can own my body</i>
<i>But they'll never own my mind</i>

46:14.848 --> 46:16.987
<i>So they better face the facts</i>
<i>'Cause now is the time</i>

46:17.088 --> 46:19.936
<i>Till we all join hands</i>
<i>And all of us say</i>

46:20.032 --> 46:22.749
<i>They will not take it all away</i>

46:33.888 --> 46:36.539
That's really funny.
'Cause I've been cleaning all day,

46:36.640 --> 46:38.942
so you think that it'd be funny
to come in and throw a cup down.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.887
Because I've been working really hard
and you want to ruin that for me.

46:41.984 --> 46:45.562
I love that! You're just...
You're so fucking cool, you bitch.

46:45.664 --> 46:48.893
Yeah, get some, you punk-ass bitch!
Come here, you steaming fuck!

46:57.920 --> 47:02.296
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- You want that scholarship, don't you?

47:03.424 --> 47:04.537
Go on.

47:09.024 --> 47:13.978
Come on, man! You can do it!
I believe in you! You're the coolest, bro!

47:15.040 --> 47:18.336
- Yeah, he's totally fucked. Yep.
- Yeah, totally.

47:18.621 --> 47:19.996
Shit! Run away!

47:21.533 --> 47:27.196
Let's just say that this morning was,
well, rather shocking.

47:27.709 --> 47:30.611
Heck, I didn't even know
what some of those words meant.

47:30.717 --> 47:32.888
I had to search the Internet for them.

47:32.990 --> 47:37.146
But I guess that's what happens
when you choose to stay at a frat house,

47:37.245 --> 47:40.060
rather than the dorm room
we assigned you.

47:40.158 --> 47:42.940
I know, sir. It was a bad choice.

47:43.038 --> 47:47.893
Christ, if I had my way,
I'd kick every fraternity off this campus.

47:47.997 --> 47:52.852
Do you know that those animals
suck nitrous oxide

47:52.957 --> 47:55.990
out of balloons just to get high?

47:56.093 --> 47:58.232
Really? That's just awful!

48:00.861 --> 48:05.117
Mr. Hooper, there is no doubt
that you are academically gifted,

48:06.397 --> 48:11.252
but the scholarships we give out here
are about much more than just that.

48:11.357 --> 48:13.266
Dean Chandler, that's me.

48:14.045 --> 48:16.052
My family has a long history at Fieldmont,

48:16.157 --> 48:18.710
and I'd like to continue that legacy.

48:18.814 --> 48:21.301
Well, you know, son, I guess
you're gonna have to prove it to me.

48:21.405 --> 48:23.260
For, as of right now, Mr. Hooper,

48:23.357 --> 48:27.351
you and your scholarship
are hanging by a thread.

48:32.669 --> 48:35.352
God! You're so lame!

48:35.453 --> 48:37.209
Dude, where have you been? It's go time!

48:37.310 --> 48:41.685
Relax! Relax!
I just had to run a little errand.

48:42.621 --> 48:46.330
All my years of hard work
have finally paid off! That's my boy.

48:48.445 --> 48:50.550
- Nice.
- What's wrong, Morris?

48:52.125 --> 48:55.223
What's wrong?
I'm having a breakdown, Kevin!

48:55.325 --> 48:57.114
Or have you forgotten what that feels like?

48:57.213 --> 48:59.101
- I understand, man.
- What am I gonna do?

48:59.197 --> 49:02.906
Somehow, I have to convince the Dean
that I actually want to go here.

49:03.005 --> 49:05.078
Well, look, there's nothing
you can do about it tonight, all right?

49:05.181 --> 49:08.858
- So let's just go get our girls. Here.
- This doesn't even look like me.

49:08.957 --> 49:10.899
Whatever, Morris. Just tell the bouncer
you don't photograph well.

49:11.005 --> 49:12.467
Let me see it.

49:13.790 --> 49:18.165
Dude, this will totally work!
You guys are both just so ugly.

49:18.269 --> 49:20.309
You're a little uglier, but it'll be good.
Don't worry about it.

49:22.269 --> 49:23.928
Laquisha?

49:24.029 --> 49:27.674
Man, you actually expect me
to buy that your name is Laquisha?

49:28.445 --> 49:30.866
You know what? I like how you roll, dog.
You in.

49:30.973 --> 49:33.111
10 bucks cover tonight, guys.

49:34.557 --> 49:35.734
Shit!

49:36.413 --> 49:38.835
- Sorry, guys. No dough, no go.
- Fuck!

49:39.581 --> 49:40.661
Let the ladies through.

49:40.765 --> 49:43.100
Let the ladies through.
Let the ladies through.

49:43.197 --> 49:47.255
- What was that? They didn't pay.
- Did you see the size of those racks?

49:48.893 --> 49:52.308
- No.
- Yeah, you big, big man.

49:52.413 --> 49:54.835
You like that when
I squeeze them together for you?

49:54.941 --> 49:55.868
I said no.

49:59.677 --> 50:02.066
I cannot believe
those assholes ripped us off.

50:02.173 --> 50:04.540
They've done pretty much
everything else to us so far this weekend.

50:04.637 --> 50:06.328
Why not that?

50:06.429 --> 50:07.858
Man, do you think this is
what it's going to be like

50:07.965 --> 50:10.780
- when we're really in college?
- Who knows?

50:10.877 --> 50:13.845
Well, we probably won't all be together.
I know that.

50:13.949 --> 50:16.437
God, Morris, you're such a fucking baby!
Would you stop being a girl?

50:16.541 --> 50:19.575
- Would you please just shut up?
- What? It's true!

50:19.677 --> 50:22.938
Think about it, guys. This is it!
Senior year.

50:24.925 --> 50:26.867
Man, he's right. This is it.

50:26.973 --> 50:29.275
You know, all the more of a reason
to take advantage of being here.

50:29.373 --> 50:30.868
All right, I'm not sitting around.
Come on, you guys!

50:30.973 --> 50:31.955
Where are you going?

50:32.061 --> 50:34.450
What do you think?
We've got a frat party to go to. Come on!

50:34.557 --> 50:36.859
- What about the girls?
- Shut up.

50:40.797 --> 50:41.844
- It hurts.
- Morris, let's go!

50:41.949 --> 50:43.291
Come on.

50:43.389 --> 50:46.236
- Wait for me!
- You're so slow! You're so slow!

50:47.133 --> 50:50.002
<i>I was on my way up</i>
<i>She was on her way down</i>

50:50.109 --> 50:53.721
<i>And I didn't know I crossed that line</i>

50:53.821 --> 50:58.131
<i>Make me sick to my stomach</i>
<i>When I think of that woman</i>

50:58.237 --> 51:00.920
<i>Sitting in this cell of mine</i>

51:01.309 --> 51:05.052
<i>I said, "Goddamn, I'm only a man"</i>

51:05.149 --> 51:08.183
<i>Give me 15 years to life</i>

51:09.021 --> 51:10.744
<i>Jailbait</i>

51:40.221 --> 51:41.911
Come on, cowboy.

51:43.453 --> 51:44.500
Yeah!

51:45.309 --> 51:48.343
You guys ready to celebrate?
All right!

51:51.933 --> 51:53.591
Where's my whip?

51:55.005 --> 51:57.274
You want to be my bitch, huh?

52:01.469 --> 52:02.778
Pass it on.

52:31.261 --> 52:35.189
- Fellows, it's not polite to stare!
- What the fuck, man? What's up?

52:35.741 --> 52:39.353
Ladies, I want you to meet
some very special guests.

52:39.453 --> 52:41.046
- Hi, boys.
- What's up?

52:41.149 --> 52:44.695
- Hi, cutie.
- Me? Hi.

52:44.797 --> 52:46.968
Wait. You're the <i>Penthouse</i>
Pet of the Year.

52:47.069 --> 52:48.148
Mmm-hmm.

52:48.253 --> 52:51.482
- And you're...
- On the cover of <i>Penthouse Letters.</i>

52:51.581 --> 52:54.264
Fellows!
Good for you for staying current.

52:55.677 --> 52:59.736
Where were we? Where were we?
Where were...

53:02.524 --> 53:04.696
Yeah, that's right. Ladies?

53:04.796 --> 53:07.928
These guys were nice enough
to pay for all this.

53:08.029 --> 53:10.451
Wait a second. That's what you did
with our money? You paid for this party?

53:10.556 --> 53:13.339
Hey, kegs aren't cheap these days,
my man.

53:13.436 --> 53:15.346
Neither are the circus animals
we got coming later.

53:15.453 --> 53:17.079
Wait! You couldn't have paid for this.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.555
We didn't even have
that much money in our wallets.

53:18.653 --> 53:22.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What's up with that?

53:22.237 --> 53:23.895
Luckily, you guys had some plastic.

53:23.996 --> 53:25.720
God, my parents gave me that
in case of an emergency.

53:25.820 --> 53:27.708
Well, good thing they got
such a high limit!

53:27.805 --> 53:31.252
We almost maxed those puppies out.
Especially on this guy.

53:31.901 --> 53:33.275
Verne Troyer?

53:33.789 --> 53:35.894
- That's Mini-Me.
- Verne!

53:38.781 --> 53:42.359
- Why do you keep hitting me? Fuck!
- Shut up, bitch!

53:43.357 --> 53:44.731
Fucking Mini-Me.

53:44.829 --> 53:47.960
It was Bearcat's idea.
God, I love that guy.

53:49.533 --> 53:53.330
Anyhow, we've gotta go be social.

53:53.437 --> 53:56.852
You douche bags have fun. Okay? Okay.

53:56.957 --> 53:58.069
Babies?

54:00.925 --> 54:03.925
That was so weird, but so hot!
Dude, she grabbed my nipple!

54:04.029 --> 54:05.938
Dude, she twisted my nipple, dude!

54:06.045 --> 54:09.143
So, basically, this is our party.

54:09.245 --> 54:13.947
- Yeah. In a roundabout way, I guess it is.
- Why don't I like where this is going?

54:14.045 --> 54:16.052
Come on, Morris! I mean, we paid for it.
We may as well enjoy it.

54:16.157 --> 54:18.644
- That's my boy!
- Come on! Who wants to keg stand?

54:18.749 --> 54:21.531
Me! Me! I'm first!
I wanna go first! Please.

54:25.821 --> 54:28.690
- Have you ever done one of these before?
- No, but it looks like fun, huh, man?

54:28.797 --> 54:29.974
Yeah. Real fun.

54:30.077 --> 54:31.637
All right, here,
make sure you get a good shot.

54:31.741 --> 54:34.043
Wait, I thought you didn't want
to send Gina any more videos.

54:34.141 --> 54:36.279
I changed my mind, all right?
Wait till she sees this one.

54:36.381 --> 54:38.268
- Nice!
- Kev, come on.

54:38.365 --> 54:41.147
What's happening?
You don't have to do this.

54:41.853 --> 54:44.187
Yeah, I do, Morris, all right?
And you should lighten up and do one, too.

54:44.284 --> 54:46.040
Yeah, fuck nugget.

54:46.141 --> 54:48.759
Me? No way. That's a bad idea.

54:48.861 --> 54:51.894
- I'm already on thin ice with the Dean.
- Whatever!

54:53.084 --> 54:57.307
You know what? I think I'm gonna go
and find something non-alcoholic to drink.

54:57.405 --> 54:58.485
You guys have fun puking on yourselves.

54:58.588 --> 55:01.785
Okay. We will, buddy. I love you!
Call me later. Be safe.

55:01.885 --> 55:05.146
- All right, whatever. Let's do this thing!
- All right.

55:05.245 --> 55:08.027
Yeah. Be careful with him, guys.
He's fragile.

55:08.125 --> 55:10.329
Bitches spit, Kev. Bitches spit.

55:22.076 --> 55:25.208
- Hey, is there alcohol in there?
- In the punch?

55:26.845 --> 55:29.365
No, not at all.

55:29.469 --> 55:33.778
In fact, this is non-alcoholic
for our designated drivers.

55:35.101 --> 55:38.297
- Really?
- Big old Bearcat wouldn't lie to you.

55:38.396 --> 55:41.593
After last night, I feel like we bonded.

55:41.692 --> 55:45.718
In fact, if you don't believe me,
have a taste.

55:47.965 --> 55:49.721
Hey, can I have some punch?

55:49.820 --> 55:51.992
Hey, safety first.

55:52.541 --> 55:54.712
- Another designated driver.
- Thank you.

55:58.237 --> 56:03.638
- Wow! It's pretty good.
- Drink up, buddy. You look thirsty.

56:03.741 --> 56:06.643
Thanks, Bearcat. You're all right.

56:06.748 --> 56:09.399
Listen to me. If anybody,

56:09.501 --> 56:13.778
and I mean anybody,
fucks with you tonight, find me.

56:13.885 --> 56:15.291
I got your front.

56:15.388 --> 56:18.552
- Don't you mean "back"?
- If that's how you want it.

56:19.709 --> 56:22.392
If you feel something
moving in your pants, don't fight it!

56:23.453 --> 56:24.827
Who's fucking on my floor?

56:29.171 --> 56:31.756
- Heather!
- I know you!

56:31.858 --> 56:34.029
Hey, Teague, who's the blonde?

56:34.834 --> 56:38.728
Hey! Kendall! I'm glad you made it.
Let me get you girls some beers.

56:38.834 --> 56:41.038
No, thanks, Teague. Not now.

56:41.139 --> 56:45.165
If you're looking for who I think
you're looking for, don't bother.

56:45.266 --> 56:47.917
He's a loser, him and his little friends.

56:48.306 --> 56:51.819
Are you really that jealous?

56:51.922 --> 56:55.217
You had your chance, Teague,
and thank God you blew it.

57:05.146 --> 57:07.534
- Yeah!
- I wanna drink! I wanna drink!

57:08.473 --> 57:11.735
- Fuck, yeah!
- You are so awesome!

57:11.833 --> 57:13.775
- Verne!
- Verne! Hey, Verne!

57:13.881 --> 57:16.664
- Fuck you, prick!
- I love you, too!

57:16.761 --> 57:19.150
- Hey, man, did you get that one?
- Dude, you fucking drained the thing!

57:19.257 --> 57:22.966
- Holy shit. Oh, hey, hey! Look, look!
- Ladies!

57:23.065 --> 57:25.302
Hey, Kendall! Kendall, hey!

57:25.401 --> 57:26.612
What's up, ladies?

57:26.713 --> 57:27.990
We were hoping you guys would show up.

57:28.090 --> 57:31.319
Yeah, we waited at the bar
tonight for, like, two hours.

57:31.417 --> 57:32.912
Yeah. Way to blow us off.

57:33.017 --> 57:36.814
Amy, girl, you know
I'd never blow you off.

57:36.921 --> 57:41.111
Especially last night, you know,
after the lesbian thing.

57:41.209 --> 57:43.762
Hey, hey, look, the bouncer
wouldn't let us in, 'cause our IDs sucked.

57:43.865 --> 57:45.774
We got in just fine,
and we don't even have ID.

57:45.881 --> 57:49.775
Yeah, but, see, you guys got tits,
and those things are like gold.

57:50.489 --> 57:52.944
Hey, but you know what?
You know what we're gonna do?

57:53.050 --> 57:57.240
Let us make it up to you, okay,
'cause you still need those beers, right?

57:57.369 --> 58:00.369
- I think you've had plenty.
- Me? Come on! Please!

58:02.201 --> 58:04.110
I'm just getting started.

58:05.786 --> 58:07.728
All right, well,
I'm gonna get you those beers.

58:07.833 --> 58:08.782
We're gonna get you the beers.

58:08.889 --> 58:10.744
- So don't move.
- Let's go!

58:11.193 --> 58:14.007
- Excuse me, boobies! Look out!
- Wait. Where's Morris?

58:21.146 --> 58:22.672
- Cocksucking motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

58:22.777 --> 58:25.111
Come on back and fight like a man!

58:27.981 --> 58:29.737
<i>So, let's go</i>

58:29.901 --> 58:31.723
<i>And get wasted</i>

58:32.621 --> 58:34.956
<i>Let's go</i>
<i>Let's go</i>

58:35.053 --> 58:37.474
<i>And get high</i>

58:37.581 --> 58:39.042
<i>Let's go</i>

58:42.573 --> 58:44.875
Look who's here!
Little high school friends.

58:44.973 --> 58:48.006
Hey, come on, don't be a dick, Teague.
Fill us up.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.630
- What'd you say?
- I said fill us up, fucktard.

58:50.733 --> 58:52.195
Or is that too complicated for your small...

58:52.301 --> 58:55.334
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
He meant that in the nicest way possible.

58:55.437 --> 58:58.568
Stop being an asshole, Teague,
and give them our beer.

58:58.669 --> 59:02.346
So you want some beer for your ladies?

59:03.597 --> 59:04.840
All right.

59:06.541 --> 59:10.697
You know what? You guys put up with
a lot of shit these past couple of days,

59:10.797 --> 59:12.968
and you deserve this beer.

59:14.029 --> 59:16.004
In fact, hold on.

59:19.885 --> 59:22.252
Hey, everybody, listen up!
I've got a quick announcement to make!

59:22.349 --> 59:25.993
- Lay off, Teague.
- Trust me, Kendall. You're gonna love this.

59:26.765 --> 59:31.042
See these guys right here?
These guys are pre-frosh.

59:32.557 --> 59:36.102
- That's right! They're high school kids!
- High school?

59:36.205 --> 59:37.187
High school?

59:37.293 --> 59:42.149
All right, come on now, once upon a time
we were high school kids, too.

59:43.117 --> 59:45.321
- No way!
- Come on.

59:45.421 --> 59:46.370
Grow up!

59:46.477 --> 59:48.103
All right, shut up!

59:48.716 --> 59:50.375
These guys are cool.

59:50.765 --> 59:53.798
They're good guys
who want a beer and a good time.

59:54.797 --> 59:56.324
Give them one.

59:56.429 --> 59:58.818
Here it is. Your beer.

01:00:08.717 --> 01:00:12.743
What the fuck?
Stop peeing on me! What are you doing?

01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:14.536
Would you fucking stop peeing on me,
you little shit?

01:00:14.636 --> 01:00:19.109
Say what?
Nobody talks to my bear kitten like that!

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:22.082
What me and him got,
you'll never understand.

01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:23.465
Pick me up, bitch!

01:00:23.565 --> 01:00:25.670
Stop calling me bitch! This is my frat.
You're embarrassing me.

01:00:25.773 --> 01:00:27.115
And now let's get fucked up!

01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:38.796
- Kendall, wait!
- Nice one.

01:00:43.661 --> 01:00:46.530
- Oh, my word, that was fun.
- That's not dancing.

01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:49.315
They can't dance.

01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:51.458
Jim! Look out!

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:57.891
- Sweet Jesus! That was close!
- Hi! Dean Chandler!

01:00:57.997 --> 01:01:00.298
Just the guy I wanted to talk to.

01:01:03.053 --> 01:01:05.835
Oh, my God!

01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:17.638
I'm so dead.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:21.800
Yeah, well, at least you didn't get
beer poured on you by about 300 people.

01:01:21.901 --> 01:01:23.591
Yeah, Kendall looked
pretty pissed back there, huh?

01:01:23.693 --> 01:01:24.642
Pissed?

01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:29.189
Dude, it looked like she was gonna
shoot fucking daggers out of her eyeballs.

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:34.022
Kev? Kev! Where you going?

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:36.842
I'm gonna go apologize.
You coming with me?

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:52.483
Hey! Shut the fuck up!
This is my favorite part! Watch this shit!

01:02:02.668 --> 01:02:03.912
Dude.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:07.404
There's Goose! There's Goose!

01:02:08.973 --> 01:02:11.340
Shit, that's funny!
Hey, play that shit again!

01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:12.931
Play it in slow-mo!

01:02:13.037 --> 01:02:16.353
- You guys do this shit for fun?
- All day, every day.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.526
- Butch up, Goose! Stop being a pussy!
- Yeah!

01:02:22.541 --> 01:02:26.567
I just saw those high school kids
heading over to the sorority house.

01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:28.458
Just saying.

01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:34.028
No way.

01:02:37.517 --> 01:02:38.794
What?

01:02:38.892 --> 01:02:42.689
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Why? So you can tell me more lies?

01:02:42.797 --> 01:02:44.869
- No, thanks.
- Hey! Wait!

01:02:48.077 --> 01:02:51.655
- Come on, I leave tomorrow.
- You know, I thought you were different.

01:02:51.757 --> 01:02:55.237
But you're just like the rest of them.
Have a nice drive.

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.180
College blows!

01:03:00.716 --> 01:03:02.789
You think I'll ever see Heather again?

01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:05.740
Probably not, Morris.
I pretty much blew it for all of us.

01:03:05.837 --> 01:03:07.746
So that was my last shot
to score with Amy.

01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:09.827
All I wanna do is bang
one college chick this weekend.

01:03:09.933 --> 01:03:11.907
Is that so much to ask?

01:03:12.013 --> 01:03:13.420
What the hell?

01:03:16.076 --> 01:03:17.964
My glasses! My glasses!

01:03:20.653 --> 01:03:23.402
Get them in the van! Get them in.

01:03:23.949 --> 01:03:25.291
Get them in.

01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:38.689
You pukes are worthless.
- Worthless!

01:03:38.797 --> 01:03:42.441
Nothing but a bunch
of goddamn high school kids!

01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:45.029
Goddamn high school kids!

01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:53.833
I can't believe we're even out here
wasting our time on you.

01:03:53.932 --> 01:03:56.616
Wasting our motherfucking time!

01:03:56.717 --> 01:03:59.335
Dude, what's with the repeating?
It's fucking killing me.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:03.626
Sorry! It's stupid. Can I get a hug?

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.322
Just go stand over there
and look fucking mean.

01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:10.436
Do the growl thing.

01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:14.185
Come on, man, I'll jeeper creeper
these motherfuckers. Hug me.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.610
We got beer to drink.
So it's been fun, kind of.

01:04:30.252 --> 01:04:31.976
By the way,

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:36.135
have you guys ever seen
a pig stampede before?

01:04:36.237 --> 01:04:38.986
- Fucked up. Pig stampede.
- Pig stampede!

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:41.190
Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:43.813
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:46.917
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

01:04:56.013 --> 01:04:59.112
Get out of the front seat, bitch!
I called shotgun!

01:05:03.948 --> 01:05:05.639
Shit! Run!

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:17.162
Keep running, you little sicko pig fuckers!

01:05:22.413 --> 01:05:23.395
This sucks.

01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:26.796
Yeah, thanks for
stating the obvious, Carter.

01:05:26.892 --> 01:05:31.497
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think I actually miss high school.

01:05:33.516 --> 01:05:35.272
- What, Kevin?
- Nothing. Forget it.

01:05:35.373 --> 01:05:37.129
Don't forget it. If you have
something to say, fucking say it!

01:05:37.229 --> 01:05:39.563
Okay, fine, you want it? Here it is.
You're full of shit, Carter!

01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:40.643
I'm full of shit?

01:05:40.748 --> 01:05:42.887
Yeah! You're always talking
such a big fucking game, man.

01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:46.153
You know what? Newsflash!
He's never even been laid.

01:05:48.172 --> 01:05:53.224
- So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, Kevin?
- No, no, no. Wait. You're still a virgin?

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:57.318
- Man! This is great.
- Yeah, whatever, Morris! Shut up!

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.849
You know what, Kev? Stop dumping on us

01:05:58.957 --> 01:06:00.866
'cause the weekend didn't turn out
the way you thought it would!

01:06:00.973 --> 01:06:02.598
Yeah, probably because
I've been listening to you too much.

01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:06.924
Yeah, 'cause it was my idea to try
to prove Gina wrong and lie to Kendall!

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.704
- That was all you, man!
- Guys, come on. Let's not fight.

01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:12.106
You know what? Stay out of it, Morris!
You're not part of this!

01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:13.514
I'm not part of this?

01:06:13.613 --> 01:06:15.500
This was supposed to be yours
and my weekend here.

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.025
Dude, whatever.
I didn't mean it like that.

01:06:17.132 --> 01:06:18.921
No, but while we're comparing
shitty weekends,

01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:20.036
here's one for you.

01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:22.694
My face got written on
before my scholarship interview,

01:06:22.797 --> 01:06:24.619
a pig just snacked on my nuts,

01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:26.539
and, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot about this one,

01:06:26.637 --> 01:06:28.098
I puked on the Dean's car,

01:06:28.205 --> 01:06:30.408
which pretty much means
that I'm not getting my scholarship!

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:31.752
God, Morris! Ever since you got here

01:06:31.853 --> 01:06:33.893
you whine, whine, whine
about your fucking scholarship.

01:06:33.996 --> 01:06:35.044
You don't even want to go here.

01:06:35.148 --> 01:06:37.570
It's not about what I want!
You know how my parents are!

01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:39.978
Yeah, well, then grow some fucking balls
and stand up to them.

01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:41.386
It's not that easy.

01:06:41.484 --> 01:06:43.656
Hey, man, what's next?
They're gonna choose what job you take?

01:06:43.756 --> 01:06:46.440
- What girl you marry?
- Dude, lay off, Kev!

01:06:47.244 --> 01:06:48.968
That's a first.
You're sticking up for Morris, man?

01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:51.851
- You bag on him more than anyone.
- That's not true and you fucking know it!

01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:53.061
Ha!

01:06:53.996 --> 01:06:56.265
Okay, you know what, Morris? Fuck you!

01:06:56.365 --> 01:06:58.754
That's the last time
I ever have your fucking back!

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.083
You know what? Fuck you, too, Kevin,
for dumping all your bullshit on us.

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:08.360
All right, fine, Morris.
Yeah, walk away with him.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.981
Why don't you hold his hand
while you're at it?

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:14.946
- Fuck you, Kevin.
- Dropping the F-bomb, big man.

01:07:15.053 --> 01:07:17.093
What is that,
the first time you ever used it?

01:07:17.196 --> 01:07:19.106
I'm telling your parents!

01:07:20.332 --> 01:07:21.347
Fuck!

01:07:21.452 --> 01:07:23.591
<i>We do not know</i>

01:07:26.925 --> 01:07:27.981
<i>How things work</i>

01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:28.515
<i>How things work</i>

01:07:31.533 --> 01:07:34.599
<i>We do not know</i>

01:07:38.316 --> 01:07:40.585
<i>Where you go</i>

01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:47.273
<i>In the night</i>

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.492
<i>Through the door</i>

01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:57.509
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

01:08:01.133 --> 01:08:05.126
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:09.858
<i>Out of the blue</i>

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.817
<i>We do not know</i>

01:08:24.236 --> 01:08:28.098
<i>The door that holds you</i>

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.933
<i>Silent as glue</i>

01:08:35.276 --> 01:08:37.479
<i>We stand under it</i>

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.554
<i>But we don't understand it</i>

01:08:42.892 --> 01:08:44.899
<i>The door that holds you</i>

01:08:49.964 --> 01:08:52.550
<i>Silent as glue</i>

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:59.720
<i>And stars fall on</i>

01:09:02.925 --> 01:09:07.845
<i>Stars fall on</i>

01:09:09.389 --> 01:09:12.106
<i>Silent as glue</i>

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.461
- Nice look.
- This? Yeah, thanks.

01:09:38.444 --> 01:09:39.557
So...

01:09:44.171 --> 01:09:46.343
- Look, about what happened...
- Don't even go there.

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:50.022
- Just let me explain.
- I really don't want to hear it, Kevin.

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:51.912
I don't even know who you are.

01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:54.346
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm not even sure I know anymore.

01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:56.866
Maybe it's time you figure that out.

01:09:58.796 --> 01:10:03.499
You know, high school, college,
it wouldn't have mattered to me.

01:10:03.596 --> 01:10:05.768
Yeah, I know. It's so stupid.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.763
You know, I came down here thinking
I needed to change who I was.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.900
Lying to you was just part of it.

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:15.492
I thought you were pretty great.
Why would you want to change that?

01:10:15.596 --> 01:10:17.003
I don't know.

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.236
You don't know?

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:23.682
Like, I mean,
I kind of liked who I was, or I am.

01:10:23.788 --> 01:10:26.821
You know, a little uptight at times,
responsible.

01:10:30.956 --> 01:10:33.673
God, I really screwed up this weekend.

01:10:33.773 --> 01:10:36.162
You know, now Morris and Carter
are pissed at each other.

01:10:36.268 --> 01:10:38.177
They're both pissed at me.

01:10:40.204 --> 01:10:44.001
You just seem like the kind of person
who doesn't make mistakes.

01:10:44.364 --> 01:10:45.379
Ha!

01:10:47.373 --> 01:10:50.220
A couple weeks ago... Brace yourself.

01:10:52.588 --> 01:10:54.443
I hooked up with Teague.

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:57.028
- Huge mistake.
- Yeah, he kinda told me.

01:10:58.989 --> 01:11:01.258
Why not? He told the whole campus.

01:11:03.724 --> 01:11:06.408
Why'd you do it?
I mean, with a guy like Teague?

01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:09.029
- He is so...
- For all the wrong reasons.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.483
He was good-looking.
He made me feel special,

01:11:15.148 --> 01:11:17.537
and since he was a really good liar,

01:11:17.644 --> 01:11:23.078
he made believe that it was
more than just a one-night thing.

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.781
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:31.591
It was kind of why I freaked out tonight.

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:38.882
I found out that you lied and
I assumed that you were just like Teague.

01:11:38.988 --> 01:11:41.988
Oh, God, please, look,
I'm nothing like that guy.

01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:46.443
I'm really sorry about everything.

01:11:48.588 --> 01:11:50.955
Is this the real Kevin talking?

01:11:51.052 --> 01:11:54.248
Or is this the new and improved
college Kevin talking?

01:11:54.348 --> 01:11:55.428
No, this is the real me,

01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:58.980
the uptight, responsible,
un-fun high school one.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.166
Good. Apology accepted then.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.239
All right, well,
I gotta go find Carter and Morris.

01:12:12.684 --> 01:12:16.775
Before you go,
can I please give you some clothes?

01:12:20.748 --> 01:12:24.457
- Morris? Morris, wake up!
- Kevin?

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.929
- What's with the...
- Where's Carter?

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:39.394
Look, you guys. I've been thinking
all night. I just want to say I'm sorry

01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:41.991
about everything.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:45.059
- You said some harsh things, man.
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:46.092 --> 01:12:50.020
I've realized a lot about myself
this weekend, and you guys.

01:12:50.124 --> 01:12:51.913
I didn't mean what I said.

01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:54.468
I've just been so hung up
on what Gina told me

01:12:54.572 --> 01:12:58.827
that I haven't even stopped to think
that, you know, maybe she was wrong.

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:01.443
You guys are my best friends.

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:05.094
I'm not gonna let some stupid weekend
at college ruin that.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.377
Whatever, man. It's cool.
I like the boring Kevin more anyway.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.523
Thanks, Carter. I think.

01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:17.064
Morris?

01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:22.891
We all said some stuff, you know?
No biggie. I'm over it.

01:13:23.788 --> 01:13:26.603
Sorry I, like, freaked out and lost my shit.

01:13:32.684 --> 01:13:33.993
You guys,

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:38.281
that was so gay.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.282
That was like the third gayest thing
we've done this weekend.

01:13:41.388 --> 01:13:44.388
- It's getting out of hand.
- All right, look. Does this mean we're cool?

01:13:44.492 --> 01:13:46.794
Yeah, man. For sure.

01:13:46.893 --> 01:13:49.740
Okay! So now that we're done arguing
like a bunch of chicks,

01:13:49.836 --> 01:13:54.058
- what the hell are we doing out here?
- Go ahead and look for yourselves.

01:13:57.996 --> 01:14:00.101
- Is that all our stuff?
- Yeah.

01:14:00.204 --> 01:14:04.360
- They even threw in all our rubbers.
- Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:06.723
Yep.

01:14:23.532 --> 01:14:26.052
- Can we go home now?
- No. Not yet.

01:14:26.156 --> 01:14:29.254
- Dude, why the fuck would we stay?
- The weekend's over, Kevin.

01:14:29.356 --> 01:14:30.883
It's pretty clear
we're not wanted here anymore.

01:14:30.988 --> 01:14:32.777
Come on, you guys.
We've got to stand up for ourselves.

01:14:32.876 --> 01:14:34.948
No, we don't. We need to go home.

01:14:35.052 --> 01:14:36.296
Come on, man.
After all the shit we've been through?

01:14:36.396 --> 01:14:38.982
We can't leave like this, Morris.

01:14:39.084 --> 01:14:42.346
Besides, I can't stand up
to these fraternity assholes on my own.

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:47.179
All right, fuck it! If I'm not gonna get laid,
I might as well get revenge, right?

01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:53.441
Come on, Morris.
We can't do this without you.

01:14:54.956 --> 01:14:58.272
Come on, man. Just think about it.
Who wrote "hairy balls" on your face?

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.842
- Fraternity guys.
- Yeah.

01:14:59.948 --> 01:15:02.250
Who made you wash their car,
drink out of some dude's belly button

01:15:02.348 --> 01:15:03.809
and puke all over the Dean's car?

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:04.898
Who stripped you naked

01:15:05.004 --> 01:15:07.044
and made you feel
like a little bitch all weekend long?

01:15:07.148 --> 01:15:10.661
- Fraternity guys!
- Yeah, that's right, the fraternity guys.

01:15:10.764 --> 01:15:12.139
Look, man,
you want to stand up to your parents?

01:15:12.236 --> 01:15:15.269
Why don't you start
by taking a stand here first?

01:15:15.756 --> 01:15:18.178
Let's take those motherfuckers down.

01:15:35.148 --> 01:15:36.970
Fuck!

01:15:44.684 --> 01:15:47.018
One, two.

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.431
- Four, five...
- Dude, open the door!

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:06.699
Get over here!

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.027
Five, four, three, two...

01:17:38.252 --> 01:17:42.213
- Dude, are you sure this is going to work?
- Trust me. It's physics.

01:18:06.955 --> 01:18:08.232
Fuck.

01:18:24.684 --> 01:18:26.855
- What the fuck?
- Nothing's happening.

01:18:26.956 --> 01:18:28.363
Maybe the matches blew out.

01:18:46.444 --> 01:18:47.720
What the...

01:18:51.244 --> 01:18:53.251
Shit! Fuck!

01:18:57.196 --> 01:18:58.625
What the fuck?

01:19:15.467 --> 01:19:16.776
Fucking pig!

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.521
Fucking shit!

01:19:26.508 --> 01:19:27.685
Oh, shit!

01:19:31.052 --> 01:19:34.347
- What the fuck is happening?
- There's pigs everywhere!

01:19:39.596 --> 01:19:41.767
Fuck me! God damn it!

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.337
What the fuck?

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.384
It's beer!

01:19:51.212 --> 01:19:53.034
It's fucking beer, man!

01:20:11.659 --> 01:20:14.693
Hey, you guys, you got to come outside!

01:20:14.795 --> 01:20:17.665
I think the Beta Chi House is on fire
or something.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.627
Fuck you, pig!

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:45.863
Nice hair cut, buddy!

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.138
- Bearcat.
- Wait!

01:20:54.155 --> 01:20:57.384
Wait! Can I flush first, guys? Come on!

01:20:57.483 --> 01:21:00.483
You boys are in a world of shit now.
Disturbing the peace,

01:21:00.588 --> 01:21:02.824
destruction of property,
stealing farm animals!

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:05.957
What the hell are you talking about?
It wasn't us!

01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:12.516
- It was those fuckers right there!
- Officer, we don't even go here.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.562
No. We're just a bunch
of high school kids.

01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:18.016
You know, Officer, frankly, I'm appalled
at the behavior on this campus.

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:20.131
Motherfuckers!

01:21:20.236 --> 01:21:21.512
Fuck you!

01:21:21.612 --> 01:21:25.354
Careful there, buddy. You've got a little
cut from a straight razor on your nipple.

01:21:25.452 --> 01:21:26.979
Wait, wait! Wait!

01:21:28.811 --> 01:21:30.600
- Where's my car?
- Plastic pussy stole it!

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.041
Where's my fucking car?

01:21:38.763 --> 01:21:40.618
This was donated by
a group of our alumni.

01:21:40.716 --> 01:21:43.236
This has made a very welcome addition
to our campus.

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:46.820
And I'm sure that your child will embrace
their studies...

01:21:46.924 --> 01:21:50.502
Why don't we go ahead, guys?
Just follow me. Come on, guys.

01:21:56.364 --> 01:21:58.785
So, wait. You're in high school?

01:21:58.892 --> 01:22:02.153
Yeah. I just came here to visit
for the weekend, like you guys.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:06.409
- But you even drink like a college girl.
- Really? Thanks.

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:13.509
- So I guess this is it, huh?
- Well, it doesn't have to be.

01:22:15.947 --> 01:22:17.191
Carter!

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.529
Spank me, tiger! Yeah!

01:22:29.228 --> 01:22:32.261
- I guess I better...
- Morris.

01:22:35.563 --> 01:22:38.378
Think you're gonna go here next year?

01:22:38.476 --> 01:22:41.575
After this weekend,
I kind of feel like I already do.

01:22:41.675 --> 01:22:44.971
Plus, I already have
a girlfriend lined up, so...

01:22:45.067 --> 01:22:46.955
Yeah? And who's that?

01:22:48.907 --> 01:22:52.355
Someone I met.
She plays a mean game of quarters.

01:22:53.899 --> 01:22:58.122
So I guess that means I'll be getting
my photography lessons after all.

01:23:17.484 --> 01:23:20.746
- So that's everything.
- I guess we should get on the road.

01:23:20.843 --> 01:23:22.949
Wait. You know what? Hang on.

01:23:32.043 --> 01:23:34.214
All right, guys. Let's go home.

01:23:47.403 --> 01:23:49.192
Here comes trouble.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:52.870
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hey, Gina.

01:23:52.971 --> 01:23:55.208
So I got your video message.

01:23:55.755 --> 01:23:57.697
Looks like you guys
had a pretty crazy weekend.

01:23:57.804 --> 01:23:59.080
Hell, yeah!

01:24:01.003 --> 01:24:02.694
- Yeah!
- Breath mint.

01:24:04.972 --> 01:24:10.154
Anyway, well,
it kind of made me think a lot

01:24:10.251 --> 01:24:13.961
about you and me and, you know, us.

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:18.026
Why don't we just forget
this whole break-up thing ever happened?

01:24:18.123 --> 01:24:19.650
What do you say?

01:24:21.355 --> 01:24:22.599
Well...

01:24:25.771 --> 01:24:26.916
You know,

01:24:28.747 --> 01:24:30.308
I don't think so.

01:24:32.204 --> 01:24:35.237
- What?
- Yeah, you see, I've moved on.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:41.060
Moved on? We've only been
broken up for, like, three days.

01:24:41.163 --> 01:24:43.945
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in three days.

01:24:44.332 --> 01:24:50.245
And, Gina, that guy you saw?
Yeah, that's not really me.

01:24:51.404 --> 01:24:53.640
Well, see you around.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.806
And get a boob job, Gina. Lift.

01:24:58.476 --> 01:25:02.120
Kevin! Wait! Seriously!

01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:09.383
So what do you guys
want to do next weekend?

01:25:09.483 --> 01:25:12.353
Next weekend? Aren't you grounded for,
like, the next six months?

01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:15.307
Fuck that! No problem.
I can just sneak out.

01:25:16.939 --> 01:25:20.288
You know,
I've got a cousin that goes to U of I.

01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.433
I'll pay you $5 a sniff,
either one of your farts.

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.052
I just want to cherish
your gaseous fumes.

01:25:42.155 --> 01:25:44.010
It can be a birthday present.
My birthday's coming up!

01:25:44.395 --> 01:25:46.086
Yeah! Lost my shoe.

01:25:48.748 --> 01:25:50.570
Dude, you gotta see the shots I got
from last night's game.

01:25:50.668 --> 01:25:53.002
I got one where Stoloff is mid-air
right over the inset...

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.718
Insectercide? Whatever the hell...
What the...

01:25:57.675 --> 01:26:01.287
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

01:26:01.388 --> 01:26:02.849
- Shit.
- Yeah.

01:26:02.987 --> 01:26:04.231
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

01:26:06.571 --> 01:26:09.954
Our camping trips? Our... The school...

01:26:10.059 --> 01:26:12.132
Thing that was awesome
that we did together. Remember that?

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:14.602
It was you and me. What's the line?

01:26:16.811 --> 01:26:20.127
Looks like my years of hard work
have finally paid off!

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.827
What's the matter, Morris?

01:26:22.923 --> 01:26:25.192
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:26:25.292 --> 01:26:28.805
I've taken some whip-its, you know,
the cracker shit.

01:26:32.556 --> 01:26:34.727
Whatever, man.
You guys are lightweights. I don't feel shit.

01:26:34.827 --> 01:26:39.050
- Mom's a lightweight.
- Here... Fuck you, dude!

01:26:40.523 --> 01:26:42.531
Well, it doesn't have to be.

01:26:47.243 --> 01:26:48.487
Is that our stuff?

01:26:48.587 --> 01:26:51.304
Yeah. They even threw all our rubbers in.

01:26:52.139 --> 01:26:54.441
Those scrotum-eating baby rapers.

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.761
Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.507
Those jizz-guzzling monkey fuckers.

01:27:11.372 --> 01:27:13.827
You sucked in <i>Austin Powers.</i>
Mike Myers carried you.

01:27:13.931 --> 01:27:15.841
You didn't even say nothing, bitch.

01:27:15.947 --> 01:27:18.435
Dude, you're doing it wrong, anyway.
You gotta flip it, bitch.

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.946
Fucking beat you...

01:27:22.795 --> 01:27:25.610
Dude, this is so much better
than the brochure.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:27.431
I know, man.
I've got a good feeling about this.

01:27:27.532 --> 01:27:31.722
- I'm sorry, K.B. just said he had a boner.
- He said he had a boner.

01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:33.096
<i>Can we cut? Cut.</i>

01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:35.651
I've got to ask you a favor.

01:27:36.524 --> 01:27:38.050
You know that book about the mice

01:27:38.155 --> 01:27:41.188
that Miss Dangle is asking
everybody to read?

01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:43.779
- That's way too much cereal.
- Swallow.

01:27:45.611 --> 01:27:48.000
Twin powers, activate!

01:27:49.195 --> 01:27:53.287
Form of a screaming...
Screaming manimal!

01:27:57.419 --> 01:28:01.314
<i>Bearcat's gay and he wants to do me</i>

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:06.437
<i>I'm gonna punch his face</i>
<i>And then he'll sue me</i>

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.369
<i>I'm going home with
pussy on my pee-pee</i>

01:28:12.523 --> 01:28:19.015
<i>Gonna tell my friends</i>
<i>That college is the shitty, yeah</i>

01:28:20.492 --> 01:28:21.866
<i>Eat that shit</i>

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.141
And cut!

01:29:25.382 --> 01:29:26.382
