00:09.487 --> 00:14.792
(running footsteps, panting)

00:15.527 --> 00:16.660
Oh.

00:16.661 --> 00:18.196
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

00:18.197 --> 00:19.865
Wow, look at you.

00:19.866 --> 00:22.367
Oh. Thanks.

00:22.368 --> 00:24.835
- Oh, I'm running late.
- Oh,

00:24.836 --> 00:27.504
- Uh, go, go. Okay.
- Yeah, okay, right.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.706
(panting)

00:29.707 --> 00:32.008
Oh, not again.

00:34.845 --> 00:38.415
Kristen, you got to stop
these secret ninja food drops.

00:38.416 --> 00:40.618
We need to talk
before things get weird...

00:42.054 --> 00:43.956
...weirder.

00:43.957 --> 00:46.660
(moans)
Oh, my dear sweet Lord.

00:46.661 --> 00:48.895
The natural wool fibers

00:48.896 --> 00:51.398
provide an aggressive yet
forgiving exfoliation

00:51.399 --> 00:53.401
without any of the
painful afterburn

00:53.402 --> 00:55.436
of some of your
cheaper synthetics.

00:55.437 --> 00:57.038
(moans) Oh, yeah.

00:57.039 --> 00:58.139
Oh...

00:58.140 --> 01:00.141
That's disgusting.

01:00.142 --> 01:02.877
You rub your ass on everything,
and I want it to stop.

01:02.878 --> 01:05.212
Ryan, my anal glands
need to be expressed.

01:05.212 --> 01:07.047
It's my constitutional right.

01:08.316 --> 01:10.217
Freedom of expression.

01:10.218 --> 01:14.221
Oh, Mexican today... she's
mixing it up a little.

01:14.222 --> 01:15.989
She must be worried sick about me.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.825
You think she's doing this
because she cares?

01:17.926 --> 01:20.394
This is a guilt burrito.

01:20.395 --> 01:22.564
And they put onions in it.

01:22.565 --> 01:23.632
Son of a bitch!

01:23.633 --> 01:25.367
I do feel guilty.

01:25.368 --> 01:27.670
I mean, Kristen was just
trying to be a good sister,

01:27.671 --> 01:29.672
and I told her
to get out of my life.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.208
But she just wants
what's best for me.

01:31.209 --> 01:33.577
Then she should
accept you as you are.

01:33.578 --> 01:35.079
Kirsten's always busting balls.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.381
Does she ever try
just licking them?

01:37.382 --> 01:40.084
How am I gonna get her
to stop this?

01:40.085 --> 01:44.288
You know how Jenna stopped me
from chewing on her panties?

01:44.289 --> 01:46.490
She didn't.

01:46.491 --> 01:48.258
Know why?

01:48.259 --> 01:50.227
She never caught me in the act.

01:50.228 --> 01:53.363
You got to catch Kristen
in the act.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.098
(slurps)

01:55.099 --> 01:56.099
(sighs):
Ah...

01:58.002 --> 02:00.503
RYAN: How are we supposed
to spot Kristen

02:00.504 --> 02:02.639
with all this smoke?

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
Use the wipers.

02:06.278 --> 02:08.413
That's better.

02:08.413 --> 02:09.848
(groans)
This is ridiculous.

02:09.848 --> 02:11.617
Don't open that door!

02:11.618 --> 02:13.152
What's the point
of having a bake-out

02:13.153 --> 02:15.689
if we don't get properly baked?

02:15.690 --> 02:17.691
(groans)

02:17.692 --> 02:20.027
(squirting)
Aah! What the...?

02:20.028 --> 02:21.829
Not the floor mat.
I'm trying to change your behavior.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.431
I caught you in the act.

02:23.432 --> 02:25.701
Ryan... I've been
doing this for years.

02:25.702 --> 02:27.836
You can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

02:27.837 --> 02:30.072
That's pretty good;
I just came up with that.

02:30.073 --> 02:31.841
You should write that down.

02:31.842 --> 02:33.242
No.

02:35.212 --> 02:37.748
Aah...! Why?!

02:37.749 --> 02:39.483
- Why?
- KRISTEN: Aah! Shit!

02:39.484 --> 02:40.417
- Kristen!
- Kristen!

02:45.457 --> 02:46.758
(quietly):
Oh, God...

02:47.460 --> 02:49.761
What the hell is your guitar
doing on the steps?

02:49.862 --> 02:51.429
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah, I found

02:51.430 --> 02:54.099
your guitar in the basement...
I left it on the steps.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.768
- Is it broken?
- No, I think it's just out of tune.

02:56.769 --> 02:57.869
(groans)
(plucks string)

02:57.870 --> 03:00.539
(sighs)

03:02.275 --> 03:03.976
I don't take generic.

03:03.977 --> 03:06.078
This is a switch, huh?

03:06.079 --> 03:08.548
<i>Back when we were kids,
you gave me the boo-boo medicine.</i>

03:08.549 --> 03:10.584
I gave you boo-boo medicine
not too long ago

03:10.585 --> 03:11.852
and you abused it.

03:11.853 --> 03:13.086
Remember?

03:13.087 --> 03:14.354
You're right.

03:14.355 --> 03:15.388
I messed up.

03:15.389 --> 03:16.757
But I'm feeling better.

03:16.758 --> 03:18.992
In fact, my life is great.

03:18.993 --> 03:21.295
(laughs) Dog-sitting
is not a career, Ryan.

03:21.296 --> 03:24.331
Is this how you're, you're gonna
spend the rest of your life?

03:24.332 --> 03:26.066
(winces, sighs)

03:26.067 --> 03:28.169
God, I have to work
at the hospital

03:28.170 --> 03:29.703
all day tomorrow,
I can't drive,

03:29.704 --> 03:33.641
and my stupid husband
is off golfing in Vegas.

03:33.642 --> 03:36.311
(sighs) Leo's so boring,
he probably is golfing.

03:36.312 --> 03:37.445
I'd be happy to drive you.

03:37.446 --> 03:39.013
Thank you, Ryan,

03:39.014 --> 03:41.816
but if I am not there
on time to catch the baby,

03:41.817 --> 03:43.084
I don't get paid.

03:43.085 --> 03:45.085
Look, I know I've been
a little unreliable,

03:45.086 --> 03:46.420
but, come on,
give me

03:46.421 --> 03:48.089
a chance to prove
I've changed.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.924
(electric guitar
playing in distance)

03:49.925 --> 03:51.592
Did you hear that?

03:51.593 --> 03:53.494
Yeah. You sound very sincere.

03:53.495 --> 03:54.928
No, I mean...

03:54.929 --> 03:56.830
I'll be right back.

03:56.831 --> 04:00.001
(rock guitar solo playing)

04:04.105 --> 04:06.040
You're late.
If this band's gonna make it,

04:06.041 --> 04:08.576
we need to show a
bit more dedication.

04:08.577 --> 04:10.678
- We have a band?
- Yeah. All's we gotta do

04:10.679 --> 04:12.814
is lay down a demo,
shop it around to the labels

04:12.815 --> 04:14.249
and then start giggling.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.350
We're gonna go big-time, baby.

04:15.351 --> 04:16.584
I'm talking six fingers!

04:16.586 --> 04:17.752
And it all starts tomorrow.

04:17.753 --> 04:20.456
- I can't.
- Why not?

04:20.457 --> 04:22.592
- I have to help Kristen.
- You're letting her get between

04:22.593 --> 04:25.028
- you and the band... I can't believe this!
- Calm down!

04:25.029 --> 04:27.030
Yeah, that's what John Lennon
said before he ran off

04:27.031 --> 04:28.331
and got nude with
that Asian bitch!

04:28.332 --> 04:30.468
- Don't be racist.
- How can I be racist?

04:30.469 --> 04:32.970
- I'm incapable of seeing color.
- Wilfred, she needs me.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.672
Oh, and I don't?

04:34.673 --> 04:36.774
You know how I feel about
being left alone, Ryan!

04:36.775 --> 04:38.275
It's just a few hours.

04:38.276 --> 04:39.510
Yeah, what am I supposed to do

04:39.511 --> 04:40.645
all by myself in
a big, empty house?

04:40.646 --> 04:41.812
Geez, so high-maintenance.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.447
What if something happens?

04:43.448 --> 04:44.114
What could happen?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.686
Well, I guess we'll find out.

04:50.388 --> 04:51.488
(crackling)

04:51.489 --> 04:53.323
(grunts)

04:54.892 --> 04:56.560
(groans)

05:01.138 --> 05:03.740
Wow. Look at this place.

05:05.576 --> 05:07.844
I think this is
gonna work out great.

05:07.845 --> 05:10.414
(dogs barking)
I mean, it's pretty cool, huh?

05:10.415 --> 05:12.349
We got an outdoor area, and...

05:12.350 --> 05:13.516
Look, a TV.

05:13.517 --> 05:15.251
I'm begging you, Ryan,

05:15.252 --> 05:17.387
don't leave me in here
with all these losers.

05:17.388 --> 05:19.021
Look at the hair
on this punce.

05:19.022 --> 05:21.390
And the pug...
"I'm so ugly, I'm cute."

05:21.391 --> 05:22.725
No, you are ugly.

05:22.726 --> 05:24.259
And look at this genius,

05:24.260 --> 05:26.027
chasing his tail
around in circles.

05:26.028 --> 05:28.529
It's not going anywhere!

05:28.530 --> 05:29.931
What the...?

05:31.633 --> 05:33.568
This is my friend, Ryan.

05:33.569 --> 05:36.036
And this must be Wilfred!

05:36.037 --> 05:38.171
Hi, Wilfred! (chuckles)

05:38.172 --> 05:39.773
What is he?

05:39.774 --> 05:41.208
Good question.

05:41.209 --> 05:42.710
Well, he's gorgeous.

05:42.711 --> 05:44.044
And something tells me

05:44.045 --> 05:45.946
he likes peanut butter!

05:45.947 --> 05:47.681
JENNA:
Oh, God, it's his favorite!

05:47.682 --> 05:48.882
(laughs)

05:48.883 --> 05:50.650
He looks a little nervous.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.252
Yeah. He'll be fine.

05:52.253 --> 05:53.987
Look... he's already
made a friend.

05:53.988 --> 05:56.055
Smoke?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.925
Yeah, I should quit, too.

05:59.994 --> 06:03.229
This is better than being left
alone at home all day, right?

06:03.230 --> 06:05.531
Yeah. That's Ryan.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.267
Ha! I never noticed that before,
but you're right,

06:08.268 --> 06:10.402
<i>it is too big for his body!</i>

06:10.403 --> 06:12.471
L-O-L!

06:12.472 --> 06:14.472
I'll be back before lunch.

06:14.473 --> 06:16.541
Bye, Wilfie.

06:16.542 --> 06:21.045
Don't you guys worry,
I have a gift with dogs, okay?

06:21.046 --> 06:23.047
(dog barking)

06:23.048 --> 06:25.283
Wilfred's gonna have a ball.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.387
Right on time;
I'm impressed.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.890
No, actually, I'm shocked.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.058
See? It's the new Ryan.

06:34.059 --> 06:35.226
(inhales sharply)

06:35.227 --> 06:36.661
What's wrong?

06:36.662 --> 06:38.664
When you threw
my crutches in back,

06:38.665 --> 06:40.899
it vibrated
right into my ankle.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.268
Sorry.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.939
(sighs)

06:49.978 --> 06:51.879
Crap.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.814
I'm out of gas.

06:53.815 --> 06:55.883
(sighs
You're kidding!

06:55.884 --> 06:58.086
(chuckles)
Yeah, I'm kidding.

06:58.087 --> 07:00.888
Ryan, don't tease me...
when I get stressed, my ankle hurts.

07:00.889 --> 07:03.257
Is that why they call it
a stress fracture? (groans)

07:03.258 --> 07:04.258
(laughs)

07:04.259 --> 07:05.926
Laughing hurts, too.

07:08.129 --> 07:09.296
Hey, it's Ryan.

07:09.297 --> 07:10.931
I'm just checking in on Wilfred.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.533
How's he doing?

07:12.534 --> 07:14.368
DARRYL:
Oh, he's fitting right in.

07:14.369 --> 07:16.202
Man, he sure does
love peanut butter.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.604
Okay. Well, I'll be there
in a half an hour.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.039
OK. Take care.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.711
How was the C-section?
(groans)

07:27.712 --> 07:30.080
Twins... one ugly baby two times.

07:30.081 --> 07:32.749
Whatever, who cares?
Where do you want to have lunch?

07:32.750 --> 07:34.717
Oh, I have to be somewhere.

07:34.718 --> 07:36.819
- I'm buying.
- No, it's not that.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.988
I just have to pick up Wilfred.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.291
That dog? That's why you
don't want to have lunch with me?

07:41.292 --> 07:43.293
- No, I do.
- No, no, I get it.

07:43.294 --> 07:45.329
- You're still angry with me
about something. - I-I'm not mad.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.398
- I have no idea what. All I've ever tried
- I just promised I'd...

07:47.399 --> 07:48.833
- to do is keep you safe...
- Kristen, just listen to me...

07:48.834 --> 07:51.202
I'm just saying...
Okay! Let's go to lunch!

07:53.406 --> 07:55.674
Ryan, keep your voice down;
you're embarrassing me.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.647
(music playing quietly)

08:02.648 --> 08:04.383
Hello?

08:04.384 --> 08:05.951
(door opens)

08:05.952 --> 08:07.686
Oh, hi.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.355
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.058
I had lunch with my sister, and...

08:13.059 --> 08:15.428
- she wanted to go shopping...
- It's okay. (chuckles)

08:15.429 --> 08:17.963
Wilfred and I had a great time.
Didn't we, Wilfred?

08:17.964 --> 08:19.231
Can we go now?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.366
Ah-ah-ah.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.900
- Bear stays here.
- Of course.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.702
Wilfred, drop it.

08:24.703 --> 08:26.371
Drop... it!

08:26.372 --> 08:28.273
What's wrong with you?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.573
He must be hungry.

08:29.574 --> 08:30.975
Well, he shouldn't be.

08:30.976 --> 08:33.544
(chuckles)
Bye, Wilfred.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.073
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:42.788 --> 08:45.824
I never wear jackets anymore.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.226
But she really
wanted me to have it.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.396
It's very fetching, Ryan...
a perfect choice.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.931
You know, Kristen's not so bad.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.467
Once she ran out
of things to criticize,

08:54.468 --> 08:56.269
we actually had a lot of fun.

08:56.270 --> 08:57.803
I'm very happy for you, Ryan.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.506
I'm happy for you both.

08:59.507 --> 09:03.008
I think she's finally starting to
accept me for who I am... Wilfred!

09:03.109 --> 09:04.276
(urinating)

09:04.277 --> 09:05.844
What are you doing!

09:05.845 --> 09:07.645
- It's a cry for help, mate.
- Is this because

09:07.646 --> 09:10.147

19:39.972 --> 19:42.806
The canine ear is four
times more sensitive

19:42.807 --> 19:45.409
<i>than that dried apricot
you call an ear.</i>

19:45.410 --> 19:47.778
As a matter of fact...

19:47.779 --> 19:50.380

I'm hearing something

19:50.381 --> 19:52.950
three or four miles away.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.186
Glass breaking.

19:56.187 --> 19:58.656
Footsteps.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.424

They're both female.

20:13.103 --> 20:15.705
Should I call...

20:15.706 --> 20:18.308
