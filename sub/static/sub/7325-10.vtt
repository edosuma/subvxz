08:13.624 --> 08:14.965
TEACHER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIP
WITH KEPNER,

08:14.965 --> 08:17.227
AND NOW SHE'S ALL OVER ME.

08:17.227 --> 08:19.229
I BROUGHT NOTES SO I CAN KEEP
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MEDICINE,

08:19.229 --> 08:20.971
BUT SHE KEEPS ASKING ME
ALL THESE PERSONAL QUESTIONS,

08:20.971 --> 08:22.533
AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF CARDS.
(cell phone chimes)

08:22.533 --> 08:23.704
(cell phone beeps and buzzes)

08:23.704 --> 08:24.835
DID YOU JUST GET PAGED?
BOTH OF YOU?

08:24.835 --> 08:26.176
ALL OF US.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.507
BIG TRAUMA BACK AT THE RANCH.
YOU KIDS COMING?

08:27.507 --> 08:28.809
YES, INDEED.
YEAH, I'M COMING, TOO.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.141
NOPE. UH, YOU DON'T GET
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

08:31.141 --> 08:32.843
WITH BOOZE IN YOUR SYSTEM,
HOBO JO.

08:32.843 --> 08:34.214
YOU'RE HOBO JO?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.216
LIKE "RIDES THE RAILS
AND EATS BEANS FROM A CAN"?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.888
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
WEIRD.

08:37.888 --> 08:39.820
SHANE, YOU CAN RIDE
WITH ME.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.252
♪ YOUR TROJAN'S IN MY HEAD ♪

08:42.252 --> 08:43.654
(indistinct conversations)

08:43.654 --> 08:45.195
♪ TAKE IT OFF ♪

08:45.195 --> 08:46.226
♪ TAKE IT IN ♪

08:46.226 --> 08:48.528
A BEER FOR ME
AND ANOTHER ROUND FOR HOBO JO.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.200
YOU GOT IT.
LET ME GUESS.
UH, THUNDERBIRD

08:50.200 --> 08:52.162
OR IS IT JUST, UH,
STRAIGHT PAINT THINNER?

08:52.162 --> 08:54.034
(laughs)

08:54.034 --> 08:56.166
(Leah) I TOLD YOUR FIANCE
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.808
BUT NOT
WHO THE PATIENT WAS?

08:57.808 --> 08:58.969
SHOULD I HAVE?

08:58.969 --> 09:01.111
NO, NO.
HE'D JUST SEND EVERYBODY HOME.

09:01.111 --> 09:04.214
I AM STILL
GETTING MARRIED TODAY.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.947
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.278
OH, TELL ME
HE DIDN'T CALL IT OFF.

09:08.278 --> 09:09.750
NO ONE CALLED ANYTHING OFF.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.021
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

09:11.021 --> 09:13.584
OH, WELL, UH, C.T. SHOWS
AN AORTIC ANEURYSM SO BIG,

09:13.584 --> 09:15.656
IT'S TORN INTO THE DUODENUM.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.157
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
THAT BIG.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.989
YEAH, ME NEITHER.
SCRUB FAST.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.262
CHIEF,
WHERE DO YOU NEED US?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.864
JUST A SECOND, AVERY.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.836
GUESS DR. BAILEY
BEAT US TO THE FUN.

09:25.836 --> 09:27.097
DR. BAILEY'S HERE?

09:27.097 --> 09:29.099
SHE AND DR. GREY ARE WORKING
ON ADELE WEBBER IN O.R. ONE.

09:29.099 --> 09:30.701
(April)
DR. WEBBER'S WIFE?

09:30.701 --> 09:31.872
SHOULD WE--

09:31.872 --> 09:33.043
YOU HAVE A DEGLOVING INJURY
IN TRAUMA 1.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.204
TAKE CARE OF YOUR PATIENT.

09:34.204 --> 09:36.176
LET BAILEY AND GREY
TAKE CARE OF THEIRS.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.978
(woman) DON'T TOUCH ME!

09:37.978 --> 09:40.811
DR. HUNT,
A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE.

09:40.811 --> 09:42.813
YOU COME AT ME
WITH THAT THING AGAIN,

09:42.813 --> 09:45.115
AND YOU WILL NOT LIKE
WHERE IT ENDS UP.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.287
YOU TWO MAKE THE ROUNDS.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.289
I WANT STATUS REPORTS
ON ALL THE INJURED,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.692
AND FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.724
YOU TWO AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE
EXCEPT THE WAITING ROOM.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.025
AND, MA'AM,
YOU NEED TO SIT BACK.

09:55.025 --> 09:57.027
DON'T CALL ME "MA'AM."

09:57.027 --> 09:58.268
IT'S GASOLINE.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.971
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE WAY OF CLUB BUSINESS.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.332
YOU SCREW WITH ONE OF US,

10:02.332 --> 10:04.875
AND WE WILL ALL
SCREW WITH YOU.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.877
OKAY.

10:06.877 --> 10:09.309
(clears throat)

10:10.340 --> 10:12.713
YOU WANT YOUR GUYS
TAKEN CARE OF?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.845
THAT'S ALL MY GUYS
ARE TRYING TO DO.

10:14.845 --> 10:17.117
NOW I'LL LET THESE GENTLEMEN
CONDUCT THEIR INVESTIGATION

10:17.117 --> 10:19.089
AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT BOTHER

10:19.089 --> 10:21.091
ANY OF MY PATIENTS.

10:21.091 --> 10:22.622
AND YOU SETTLE DOWN

10:22.622 --> 10:24.294
AND LET DR. BROOKS HERE
DO HER JOB.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.331
DEAL.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.263
AH.

10:33.263 --> 10:37.307
(panting)

10:37.307 --> 10:38.839
HOW'S GASOLINE

10:38.839 --> 10:40.340
A-AND THE HAMMER?
THESE ARE PEOPLE?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.342
(groans) YEAH.
THOSE ARE THEIR ROAD NAMES.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.674
YOU GET TO PICK
YOUR ROAD NAMES,

10:43.674 --> 10:45.015
AND YOU WENT WITH STUART?

10:45.015 --> 10:46.376
I'M NOT OFFICIALLY
IN THE CLUB.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.949
THEY LET ME HANG AROUND,
RIDE ALONG WITH THEM.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.280
(laughs) IT HAS BEEN

10:50.280 --> 10:52.723
THE GREATEST TIME
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

10:52.723 --> 10:54.685
(clicks tongue)
AND I RUINED IT.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.026
THAT CRASH WAS MY FAULT.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.187
MY SISTER WAS RIGHT.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.759
I HAD NO BUSINESS
BEING ON THAT BIKE.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.060
I THINK YOUR ARM
WOULD AGREE.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.993
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK GUYS
ON MOTORCYCLES ARE HOT.

11:02.993 --> 11:05.165
ALL RIGHT, STUART,
YOUR INJURIES ARE EXTENSIVE,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.667
BUT I DO THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
WE CAN SALVAGE YOUR HAND.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.399
WE'RE JUST GONNA GET YOU UP TO
THE O.R. AND DEBRIDE YOUR ARM.

11:09.399 --> 11:11.001
EDWARDS, YOU'RE WITH ME.
(elevator bell dings)

11:11.001 --> 11:13.303
UN-UNLESS YOU'D RATHER
I TOOK DR. ROSS.

11:13.303 --> 11:15.846
ARE YOU KIDDING? NO.
SH-SHANE'S MY GUY.

11:15.846 --> 11:17.007
(slaps back)

11:17.007 --> 11:18.709
(door handle clicks)

11:21.782 --> 11:23.984
NICE.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.986
OOH.

11:25.986 --> 11:29.319
(gasps) NICE VIEW.

11:31.221 --> 11:32.963
UM...

11:32.963 --> 11:34.464
OPEN OR CLOSED?

11:34.464 --> 11:36.727
CLOSED.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.701
UH, LIGHTS--
ON OR OFF?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.703
UM... WHICHEVER.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.875
HOW ABOUT...

11:44.875 --> 11:46.206
(clicks)

11:46.206 --> 11:47.778
(click)

11:49.179 --> 11:51.481
THAT'S GREAT.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.325
MM. (clicks tongue)

12:08.799 --> 12:10.801
UM, I'M SORRY. I JUST...

12:10.801 --> 12:12.763
SUDDENLY GOT SO NERVOUS.

12:12.763 --> 12:13.934
(exhales) ME, TOO.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.236
REALLY?

12:18.208 --> 12:21.141
MM.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.913
OH. OKAY, HOLD ON.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.074
OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.375
IT'S OKAY.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.378
UM... I THINK I SHOULD
TAKE THE LEG OFF FIRST.

12:28.378 --> 12:30.380
OF COURSE. YEAH.
I CAN HELP IF--

12:30.380 --> 12:31.952
NO, NO, NO.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.185
UM, VELCRO STRAPS AND PLASTIC
SOCKETS AREN'T EXACTLY SEXY,

12:35.185 --> 12:37.387
AND I WANTED THIS EVENING
TO BE ALL ABOUT SEXY,

12:37.387 --> 12:40.430
SO I THINK THAT I NEED
TO TAKE THE LEG OFF MYSELF.

12:40.430 --> 12:43.333
AND I NEED YOU
NOT TO WATCH.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.995
OH, YOU WANT ME
TO GO IN THE BATHROOM

12:44.995 --> 12:47.197
UNTIL YOUR LEG'S OFF
AND YOU'RE UNDER THE COVERS?

12:47.197 --> 12:48.839
WOULD YOU?

12:48.839 --> 12:50.770
OH.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.402
OKAY.

12:52.402 --> 12:53.773
SURE.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.148
(clears throat)

13:00.010 --> 13:02.953
(door closes)

13:07.487 --> 13:09.119
MURPHY,
GET YOUR HANDS IN HERE.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.290
(Leah) DR. BAILEY.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.223
I NEED YOU TO PUT PRESSURE
ON THE AORTA,

13:13.223 --> 13:14.524
THERE UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM.

13:14.524 --> 13:16.496
IT'S JUST A STOPGAP UNTIL
WE CAN MOBILIZE THE DUODENUM

13:16.496 --> 13:18.168
OFF THE ANEURYSM.

13:18.168 --> 13:21.301
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:21.301 --> 13:23.003
UM, GREY.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.577
MURPHY, I GOT THIS.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.840
GO UP IN THE GALLERY
AND SIT WITH HIM.
OKAY.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.984
(indistinct conversations)

13:33.984 --> 13:36.486
UH, HAVE YOU GOT A LITTLE BROWN
PAPER BAG YOU CAN PUT THAT IN?

13:36.486 --> 13:38.188
(Jo) WOULD YOU STOP?
(laughs)

13:38.188 --> 13:40.050
I HAD NO PARENTS.
I LIVED IN MY CAR.

13:40.050 --> 13:43.123
SO, YES, I HAVE TRUST ISSUES.
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.855
YOU NEED TO STOP ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

13:44.855 --> 13:46.356
WHO EVER HAD
A CRAPPY CHILDHOOD.

13:46.356 --> 13:49.199
YEAH? HOW MANY FOSTER HOMES
DID YOU GET KICKED OUT OF

13:49.199 --> 13:51.131
BEFORE YOU MOVED IN
TO YOUR CAR?

13:51.131 --> 13:52.262
UH, 17.

13:52.262 --> 13:54.534
AND I DIDN'T LIVE IN MY CAR.
I WENT TO JUVIE.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.336
STOP MAKING FUN OF ME.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.838
I'M NOT.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.570
REALLY?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.172
AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY LUCKY

14:02.172 --> 14:03.944
THAT YOUR FOLKS ABANDONED YOU.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.475
MEANS YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH
YOUR SCHIZO MOM

14:05.475 --> 14:08.118
GO AFTER YOUR BABY BROTHER
WITH A STEAK KNIFE.

14:08.118 --> 14:10.420
FINE. FAIR.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.122
BUT YOU NEVER WOKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

14:12.122 --> 14:14.184
WITH JUNKIES BANGING
ON YOUR BEDROOM WINDSHIELD,

14:14.184 --> 14:16.156
PRAYING THEY'D GET TIRED
OR BORED

14:16.156 --> 14:18.128
BEFORE THEY PUT
A ROCK THROUGH A WINDOW.

14:18.128 --> 14:20.130
NO, I DIDN'T,
BECAUSE THE JUNKIE WAS MY DAD,

14:20.130 --> 14:22.963
AND HE DIDN'T BREAK WINDOWS,
JUST FINGERS.

14:25.395 --> 14:27.397
WELL, DID YOU EVER
HAVE FOSTER PARENTS

14:27.397 --> 14:31.942
THAT MADE YOU AND 19 OTHER KIDS
SLEEP ON COTS IN THE BASEMENT...

14:31.942 --> 14:34.174
LOCKING THE DOORS
AT LIGHTS OUT,

14:34.174 --> 14:36.176
SO THAT IF YOU HAD TO PEE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

14:36.176 --> 14:39.009
YOU HAD TO USE BUCKETS
THEY SET UP ALONG THE WALL?

14:39.009 --> 14:40.550
(voice breaking)
BUCKETS YOU COULDN'T SEE

14:40.550 --> 14:42.082
BECAUSE IF YOU
TURNED THE LIGHTS ON,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.383
THE BIGGER KIDS
WOULD HOLD YOU DOWN

14:43.383 --> 14:47.157
AND TAKE THOSE BUCKETS
AND...

14:47.157 --> 14:49.219
UH...

14:49.219 --> 14:51.561
NO. NEVER.

14:51.561 --> 14:53.093
(normal voice) ME NEITHER.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.294
SAW IT IN A MOVIE
ON CABLE.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.996
(chuckles)

14:55.996 --> 14:57.167
(laughs)

14:57.167 --> 14:58.298
(laughs)

14:58.298 --> 15:00.370
HOW DID YOU GET CABLE
IN YOUR CAR?

15:00.370 --> 15:01.601
(laughing)

15:01.601 --> 15:05.976
I DON'T LIVE
IN MY CAR ANYMORE, JERK.

15:05.976 --> 15:07.277
STUART?

15:07.277 --> 15:10.110
HE WENT DOWN FIRST.
EVERYBODY ELSE FOLLOWED.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.481
(sighs deeply)

15:11.481 --> 15:13.013
EMILY BENNETT?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.945
OH, THE LAST PERSON
THAT CALLED ME THAT

15:14.945 --> 15:17.387
IS SOMEWHERE
CHOKING ON A TIRE IRON.

15:17.387 --> 15:18.548
(elevator bell dings)

15:18.548 --> 15:20.250
EXCUSE ME.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.451
G-GASOLINE?

15:21.451 --> 15:23.023
UH, I'M DR. YANG.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.326
DR. BROOKS FOUND THAT YOU HAVE
SOME FLUID AROUND YOUR HEART.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.298
SO I WOULD LIKE TO DO
A PERICARDIOCENTESIS

15:28.298 --> 15:29.399
TO RELIEVE THAT PRESSURE.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.931
NO, THANKS.
YOU'VE SEE MY X-RAYS.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.464
MY BODY'S 85% METAL.

15:34.464 --> 15:35.635
I GET OVER STUFF.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.337
WELL, YOU JUST DON'T
GET OVER THIS.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.668
UNTREATED, YOU COULD DIE.

15:38.668 --> 15:43.313
TREATED I'M STUCK IN A BED.
NO DICE, DR. YANG.

15:43.313 --> 15:44.514
I CAN'T BE OUT OF COMMISSION,

15:44.514 --> 15:47.317
NOT WHEN MY BOYS NEED ME
TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.

15:47.317 --> 15:52.082
ACTUALLY, THEY BROUGHT A GUY
IN WITH US--STUART.

15:52.082 --> 15:53.653
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.255
NO.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.287
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

15:57.287 --> 16:01.391
YOU FIND HIM,
YOU TAKE ME TO SEE HIM...

16:01.391 --> 16:04.164
AND THEN I'LL LET YOU DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

16:07.097 --> 16:10.100
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

16:12.302 --> 16:14.244
OW! DAMN IT, KID.

16:14.244 --> 16:15.405
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE DOING THAT RIGHT.

16:15.405 --> 16:16.706
CALL THE REDHEAD
OVER HERE.

16:16.706 --> 16:18.248
THERE'S NO NEED TO--

16:18.248 --> 16:19.379
NO, NO, I AIN'T GONNA SUFFER

16:19.379 --> 16:21.081
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE AVOIDING
YOUR OLD LADY.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.252
MY WHAT?

16:22.252 --> 16:24.054
I SEEN THE WAY
SHE LOOKS AT YOU.

16:24.054 --> 16:25.455
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:25.455 --> 16:26.616
SHE'S NOT LOOKING AT ME.

16:26.616 --> 16:28.618
NOT NOW.
NOW SHE'S IGNORING YOU,

16:28.618 --> 16:31.291
WHICH MEANS
SHE REALLY DIGS YOU.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.363
(sighs)

16:33.363 --> 16:35.395
OW! DAMN IT!

16:35.395 --> 16:36.596
(sighs)
WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.168
THIS KID'S A MENACE,
THAT'S WHAT.

16:38.168 --> 16:39.299
OKAY. (chuckles)

16:39.299 --> 16:41.631
SIR, JUST CALM DOWN.
THIS IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.173
ALL RIGHT?

16:43.173 --> 16:44.304
JUST...

16:44.304 --> 16:46.576
ALLOW ME TO ASSIST DR. ROSS
WITH HIS TECHNIQUE, OKAY?

16:46.576 --> 16:47.777
YEAH.

16:47.777 --> 16:49.409
OKAY.

16:49.409 --> 16:53.012
ALL RIGHT, SO FOR
A CORNER STITCH LIKE THIS,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.344
IT'S USUALLY BEST TO USE

16:54.344 --> 16:58.148
A HALF-BURIED HORIZONTAL
MATTRESS STITCH.

16:58.148 --> 17:00.290
SO YOU GO IN LIKE THAT...

17:03.453 --> 17:07.157
OKAY. I THINK I GOT IT.

17:07.157 --> 17:08.458
I MEAN...

17:08.458 --> 17:10.530
IT--IT'S LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.432
YES.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.064
GREAT WORK.

17:14.064 --> 17:16.336
YOU'RE SUCH A QUICK STUDY.
KEEP IT UP.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.468
(laughs)

17:18.468 --> 17:20.270
KEEP IT UP.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.711
(elevator bell dings)
(laughs)

17:21.711 --> 17:24.514
HER AORTA IS LIKE A ROCK.

17:24.514 --> 17:27.447
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE
GONNA SEW IN THIS GRAFT.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.519
WHERE IS THIS BLEEDING
COMING FROM?

17:29.519 --> 17:30.750
I'M NOT SURE.
HOLD PRESSURE.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.552
(Miranda and Meredith
speaking indistinctly)

17:32.552 --> 17:34.524
YOU SHOULD BE DOWN THERE
WATCHING WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.226
I CAN SEE FROM HERE.

17:36.226 --> 17:39.189
PRIMARY
AORTODUODENAL FISTULAS--

17:39.189 --> 17:40.360
THEY ALMOST NEVER HAPPEN.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.691
...my finger.
WHY NOT?

17:41.691 --> 17:45.765
THIS USUALLY WOULD PRESENT
AS A KIND OF PULSATING MASS.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.767
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, A PATIENT
WOULDN'T WAIT TO SEEK TREATMENT.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.140
THE--THE FISTULA
WOULD NEVER DEVELOP.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.301
WITH ALZHEIMER'S,

17:51.301 --> 17:53.543
THEY DON'T REMEMBER
IF THEY TOLD ANYONE.

17:53.543 --> 17:56.406
SOMEONE
SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE...

17:57.577 --> 17:59.509
PAYING ATTENTION.

17:59.509 --> 18:01.511
(Miranda) All right.
Let's see.

18:01.511 --> 18:02.852
YOU SHOULD BE DOWN THERE.

18:02.852 --> 18:06.116
SIR, RESPECTFULLY,
I AM NOT GOING DOWN THERE.

18:06.116 --> 18:09.489
YOU SHOULD STOP ASKING.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.291
The proximal clamp

18:11.291 --> 18:12.692
FRACTURED
THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.394
WE HAVE TO GET
ABOVE THE BLEEDING.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.465
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

18:15.465 --> 18:17.467
ANEURYSMS LIKE THESE
ARE CAUSED BY A BUILDUP

18:17.467 --> 18:19.799
OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.532
THEIR CLAMP BROKE OFF A CHUNK
OF ONE THESE PLAQUES...
Okay, let me have a lap.

18:22.532 --> 18:24.534
AND THAT AORTA
OPENED RIGHT BACK UP.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.536
THEY THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO MOVE THE CLAMP UP HIGHER

18:26.536 --> 18:28.238
AND CONTROL THE BLEEDING,

18:28.238 --> 18:30.540
BUT THEY'RE ALREADY UP TO
THE SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.642
THERE ISN'T ANYPLACE
LEFT FOR THEM TO GO.

18:32.642 --> 18:35.114
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:36.786 --> 18:39.789
IT MEANS, THEY'VE JUST ABOUT
RUN OUT OF OPTIONS.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.531
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.133
JUST WAIT. JUST--
JUST A MINUTE. JUST A MINUTE.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.406
UM...

18:59.369 --> 19:01.771
IS THERE ANYONE
I CAN CALL FOR YOU?

19:01.771 --> 19:03.713
SHH.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.776
BAILEY.

19:06.776 --> 19:08.418
TRY DIVIDING THE RENAL VEIN.

19:08.418 --> 19:10.149
THAT MIGHT GET YOU
ABOVE THE FRACTURED PLAQUE.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.382
But she's exsanguinating.
I don't think--

19:12.382 --> 19:14.424
JUST TRY IT!

19:14.424 --> 19:16.326
(suction gurgles)
OKAY. SCALPEL.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.158
(woman) HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

19:26.436 --> 19:29.369
(woman sobbing)

19:29.369 --> 19:31.541
HEY. HEY. ARE YOU...

19:31.541 --> 19:34.204
HEY. LOOK, I WAS KIDDING.

19:34.204 --> 19:35.345
MNH-MNH.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.207
COME ON. THAT WASN'T EVEN
THE WORST THING I SAID.

19:37.207 --> 19:38.878
OH, GOD. PLEASE.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
YOU'RE NOT A GARBAGE EATER,
OKAY? I'M SORRY.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.513
(laughing)

19:43.513 --> 19:44.484
(slaps bar top)

19:44.484 --> 19:46.686
OH-HO,
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.389
AH, I GOT YOU.
I SO GOT YOU.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.360
WHAT?

19:50.360 --> 19:51.521
TEARS, BABY.

19:51.521 --> 19:53.523
THE NUMBER ONE TOOL
OF THE STREET KID.

19:53.523 --> 19:56.426
TURN ON THE WATER WORKS,
YOU CAN GET OUT OF ANYTHING.

19:56.426 --> 19:58.368
WAIT, WAIT. YOU--YOU CAN
JUST CRY LIKE THAT?

19:58.368 --> 19:59.969
GOT THREE SURGERIES
OUT OF YOU, CHUMP.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.601
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.772
CHICKS CAN GET AWAY
WITH JUNK LIKE THAT.

20:02.772 --> 20:03.933
THAT WOULD NEVER WORK
FOR ME.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.305
YOU'RE WRONG.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.706
A GIRL CRYING IS ONE THING,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.609
BUT A GUY CRYING
FREAKS EVERYBODY OUT.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.780
REALLY?

20:10.780 --> 20:11.941
FOR SURE.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.483
SHOW ME HOW.

20:13.483 --> 20:14.884
(indistinct conversations)

20:14.884 --> 20:16.546
(man) COMING UP.

20:16.546 --> 20:18.888
(rings)

20:18.888 --> 20:20.250
(sighs)

20:20.250 --> 20:21.421
(beeps)

20:21.421 --> 20:22.392
HELLO.

20:22.392 --> 20:23.553
(lowered voice)
HEY, YOU'RE AWAKE.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.795
NO, NOT REALLY.
Oh, sorry.

20:25.795 --> 20:27.497
I JUST--I WANTED TO CHECK
YOUR POST-OP VITALS.

20:27.497 --> 20:28.558
HOW'S YOUR B.P.?

20:28.558 --> 20:30.760
UH, YOU KNOW WHO WOULD KNOW THAT
WOULD BE A NURSE.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.302
Why don't you call a nurse?

20:32.302 --> 20:33.963
RIGHT. I'LL DO THAT.

20:33.963 --> 20:35.335
WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

20:35.335 --> 20:36.566
Oh, I'm in a hotel bathroom.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.237
AND I'M ABOUT TO HAVE SEX...
(laughs)

20:38.237 --> 20:40.440
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS.

20:41.711 --> 20:43.543
I'M HANGING UP NOW.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.575
Oh, okay. Well, rest up.
(beep)

20:45.575 --> 20:47.577
(dial tone drones)

20:47.577 --> 20:49.018
(inhales sharply)

20:49.018 --> 20:50.450
(exhales)

20:50.450 --> 20:52.422
(chuckles)

20:52.422 --> 20:53.583
MM.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.389
(chuckles)

20:59.389 --> 21:01.531
(exhales)

21:03.262 --> 21:04.434
(knocks)

21:04.434 --> 21:05.565
(singsongy) HEY.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.867
(normal voice) I, UH,
DECIDED TO TAKE A BATH,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.569
WHICH YOU'RE GONNA APPRECIATE...

21:09.569 --> 21:12.602
(singsongy)
'CAUSE I SMELL AMAZING.

21:15.445 --> 21:17.507
I'M SORRY, CALLIE. I'M...

21:17.507 --> 21:19.749
I WANTED TO BE
SPONTANEOUS AND FUN.

21:19.749 --> 21:21.511
BUT I...

21:23.353 --> 21:24.614
I CAN'T.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.987
(sighs)
AND I'M SO SORRY, CALLIE.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.690
I'M--I...

21:30.690 --> 21:32.622
I'M--I'M NOT...

21:32.622 --> 21:35.765
I'M NOT READY.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.467
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.872
(keypad beeps)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:42.872 --> 21:44.534
(autodials)

21:44.534 --> 21:45.635
(phone rings)

21:45.635 --> 21:47.607
CALLING ROOM SERVICE.
WE'RE GONNA NEED CHAMPAGNE

21:47.607 --> 21:49.379
TO GO WITH OUR
MAC AND CHEESE CUPCAKES.

21:49.379 --> 21:52.612
(ring)

21:52.612 --> 21:54.644
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:56.986 --> 21:58.448
WHAT?

21:58.448 --> 21:59.949
UH, SORRY.

21:59.949 --> 22:01.491
IT'S JUST...

22:01.491 --> 22:04.624
YOUR TECHNIQUE--
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.656
IT'S DR. SLOAN'S TECHNIQUE,
ACTUALLY.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.658
BUT I AM PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

22:08.658 --> 22:09.929
HERE. YOU TRY.

22:20.370 --> 22:22.412
OKAY.

22:29.819 --> 22:30.980
(door opens)

22:30.980 --> 22:32.552
(Owen) HEY, UH,
JUST, UH, CHECKING IN.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.853
WHAT'S THE STORY?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.555
UH, S-STUART'S AFRAID HE'S NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO RIDE ANYMORE

22:35.555 --> 22:37.427
BECAUSE HE WIPED OUT
AND HIT CHICKEN BILL,

22:37.427 --> 22:38.688
AND CHICKEN BILL HIT ROACH-CLIP,
WHO ENDED UP

22:38.688 --> 22:40.690
TAKING OUT GASOLINE, THE HAMMER,
AND BLUE CORNER PETE--

22:40.690 --> 22:41.861
MEDICALLY.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.863
I MEANT
WHAT'S THE STORY MEDICALLY?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.865
WELL,
HIS LIMB IS STILL VIABLE.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.036
AND WE'RE ALMOST DONE
WITH THE DEBRIDEMENT.

22:47.036 --> 22:48.568
SO AS SOON AS HE HEALS UP,

22:48.568 --> 22:50.139
I WILL GET HIM BACK IN HERE
FOR A SKIN GRAFT.

22:50.139 --> 22:51.671
MM. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.902
THANK YOU.

22:54.404 --> 22:55.705
(door opens)

22:55.705 --> 22:57.507
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:57.507 --> 22:58.578
(sighs)

22:58.578 --> 22:59.679
(door closes)

23:02.582 --> 23:03.713
I THINK I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

23:03.713 --> 23:05.054
OKAY. DEFINITELY.

23:07.657 --> 23:09.388
(trash can lid clatters)

23:13.623 --> 23:15.124
YOU NEED TO STOP.

23:15.124 --> 23:19.669
YOU ARE NOT GROSS
AND YOU ARE NOT KAREV.

23:19.669 --> 23:20.800
(exhales)

23:20.800 --> 23:22.131
OWEN.

23:22.131 --> 23:23.533
OH, CRISTINA, I'M SORRY.

23:23.533 --> 23:24.834
I HAVEN'T HAD TWO SECONDS
TO THINK ABOUT--

23:24.834 --> 23:26.005
OH, UH, NO, ME EITHER.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.537
UM, ACTUALLY,
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR YOU.

23:27.537 --> 23:28.638
IS AVERY STILL IN THERE
WITH STUART?

23:28.638 --> 23:29.809
YEAH. WHY?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.040
OH, MY PATIENT NEEDS
A PERICARDIOCENTESIS,

23:31.040 --> 23:32.411
AND SHE WON'T LET ME
TOUCH HER

23:32.411 --> 23:33.683
UNTIL I TAKE HER
TO SEE HIM.

23:33.683 --> 23:35.144
LET ME GUESS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GASOLINE?

23:35.144 --> 23:36.516
YOU KNOW GASOLINE?

23:36.516 --> 23:37.847
OH, WE GO WAY BACK.
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO,

23:37.847 --> 23:39.919
SHE THREATENED
TO HAVE ME BEATEN SENSELESS.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.621
SOUNDS LIKE HER.
WHAT A DOLL.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.752
(laughs) WAIT.

23:42.752 --> 23:44.994
SHE WANTS TO GET CLOSE
TO STUART?

23:44.994 --> 23:46.856
YEAH. WHAT?

23:48.758 --> 23:50.099
I NEED YOU TO PAGE SECURITY

23:50.099 --> 23:51.731
AND HAVE THEM MEET ME
IN THE E.R. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

23:51.731 --> 23:52.762
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.
OWEN, WHAT?

23:52.762 --> 23:55.765
(indistinct conversations)

23:57.607 --> 23:59.068
(curtain rings clatter)

23:59.068 --> 24:00.439
WHERE THE HELL DID SHE GO?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.771
STUART'S THE REASON
THEY ALL CRASHED.

24:01.771 --> 24:03.773
YOU SCREW WITH ONE OF THEM,
THEY ALL SCREW WITH YOU.

24:03.773 --> 24:06.616
WE DON'T KEEP ANY
TIRE IRONS AROUND, DO WE?

24:06.616 --> 24:07.777
(elevator bell dings)

24:07.777 --> 24:09.078
WE NEED TO FIND HER. NOW.

24:09.078 --> 24:10.650
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:13.623 --> 24:15.785
THEY'RE SEWING IN
THE GRAFT NOW.

24:15.785 --> 24:17.987
ONTO THE AORTA?
YES.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.630
WHAT'S HER B.P.?

24:20.630 --> 24:22.762
100 OVER 60.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.634
HEART RATE?

24:24.634 --> 24:25.695
98.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.502
WHAT'S HAPPENING, SIR?

24:35.745 --> 24:37.106
(grunts)

24:37.106 --> 24:39.679
DR. WEBBER?

24:41.811 --> 24:43.883
(voice breaks) IT'S WORKING.

24:45.655 --> 24:48.818
IT'S WORKING.

24:48.818 --> 24:50.690
(exhales)

25:07.206 --> 25:08.608
(Gasoline) DON'T YOU
FREAKIN' TOUCH ME!

25:08.608 --> 25:11.510
MOVE YOUR ASS
OR HE'LL MOVE IT FOR YOU!

25:11.510 --> 25:12.281
GASOLINE,
THIS WASN'T OUR DEAL.

25:12.281 --> 25:13.713
SHOVE YOUR DEAL.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.585
YOU CAGERS
WOULDN'T LET ME SEE STUART,

25:15.585 --> 25:18.247
AND NOW MY GUYS FIND OUT
HE HAD TO HAVE SURGERY?

25:18.247 --> 25:19.949
I NEED TO SEE HIM NOW!

25:19.949 --> 25:21.150
HE IS ONE OF US
AND HE'S HURT

25:21.150 --> 25:23.122
AND HE MIGHT FREAKIN' DIE,

25:23.122 --> 25:25.054
AND I NEED TO SEE HIM!

25:25.054 --> 25:28.628
(gasping)

25:28.628 --> 25:32.732
(labored breathing)

25:34.764 --> 25:36.235
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE ROOM KEY?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.607
THE ROOM KEY?
(chuckles)

25:37.607 --> 25:39.268
OH, COME ON!

25:39.268 --> 25:41.270
I GAVE YOU THE ROOM KEY BEFORE
WE LEFT THE FREAKIN' ROOM.

25:41.270 --> 25:42.642
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
(scoffs)

25:42.642 --> 25:43.813
DID YOU?

25:43.813 --> 25:45.014
YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

25:45.014 --> 25:46.245
YOU DID THIS LAST WEEK

25:46.245 --> 25:47.947
WITH THE CHECK
FOR BECKY'S PIANO LESSON.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.278
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

25:49.278 --> 25:52.021
(crying) I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

25:52.021 --> 25:53.182
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

25:53.182 --> 25:55.184
I LOST THE KEY
