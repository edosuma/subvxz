WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:09.116
So, what, you want the parade,
the whole nine, all that?

00:09.160 --> 00:10.320
-Put 'em in the ground right.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.530
-We're ready to make
this a reality.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.650
-Nicholas Talman
and Ronald Dacey claim

00:13.700 --> 00:15.110
no ownership
to GenCoin.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.242
--I know what you are.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.781
-So then you understand why
it'd be best to never look back.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.742
-You're using us just like
you use everybody in your life!

00:22.790 --> 00:25.156
-It never leaves you.
-It's just business.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.612
-Alex Bell.
I need information.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.866
-What makes you think
I can get it?

00:28.910 --> 00:30.116
-Isabelle Morales could.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.866
-I need my people.
-I can't.

00:31.910 --> 00:33.696
-Ronald Dacey,
Nick Talman,

00:33.750 --> 00:35.536
they're the real heroes
of GenCoin.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.361
-I'm not supposed to open it.
-Alex!

00:39.870 --> 00:41.110
-Thank you. Yeah.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.116
Super good to talk
to you again.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.946
So you're at
the new offices right now?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.446
-Yup. Yeah,
we're here in Wynwood.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.151
Still ramping up the team,
trying to move towards launch.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.246
And when is that gonna be?

00:51.290 --> 00:53.110
Have you set
a hard, fast date or...?

00:53.160 --> 00:56.744
-Well, we're still testing
the beta on different platforms,

00:56.790 --> 00:59.031
we're finding our network,
all the necessary bits
and pieces.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.992
We don't want
to rush it, obviously,

01:02.040 --> 01:03.530
but there's also
the feeling that

01:03.580 --> 01:06.242
the world shouldn't have to
wait any longer for GenCom.

01:06.290 --> 01:08.110
Well, it certainly
seems that way.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.537
If you could, go ahead
and explain this to me,

01:10.580 --> 01:12.195
'cause I guess I'm a little,
I don't know, thick

01:12.250 --> 01:14.491
when it comes to
these sort of things.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.825
What is it?

01:15.870 --> 01:17.610
Is it like a PayPal?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.491
--What would you compare it to?

01:19.540 --> 01:22.907
-We||, PayPal is
a digital payment system.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.110
It's not its own currency.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.536
GenCoin is.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.787
It's like-- okay,
so, you could pay for something

01:27.830 --> 01:29.866
with a dollar
or you could pay

01:29.910 --> 01:31.286
for something with yen.

01:31.330 --> 01:34.868
Or you could pay
for something with GenCoin.

01:34.910 --> 01:37.572
-So, it actually is
its own currency?

01:37.620 --> 01:39.247
-Yes.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.650
Do you like it like that?

02:20.790 --> 02:21.859
Is it okay?

02:21.910 --> 02:23.320
Yeah, it's all right.

02:23.370 --> 02:24.906
'Cause you don't have
to have it like that.

02:24.950 --> 02:25.996
I really don't care.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.075
-It's cool, sis.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.906
-Do I stink?
-What?

02:28.950 --> 02:31.407
-Do I stink?

02:31.450 --> 02:34.499
Give me that.
God, I can't stop sweating.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.495
Thanks.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.655
Izzy?

02:42.700 --> 02:43.826
Someone to see you.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.245
-Isabelle.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.990
-Did you get
the stuff I sent you?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.780
-Yeah. Yeah, yes, I did.

02:57.830 --> 02:59.195
Let's--

02:59.250 --> 03:00.865
there is somewhere
we can talk?

03:00.910 --> 03:01.990
-Yeah.

03:04.950 --> 03:07.578
-The thing is,
you would have been
protected as an equal partner,

03:07.620 --> 03:11.249
but this third party,
Eden Field...

03:11.290 --> 03:13.997
were you aware
that Alex Bell owns it?

03:14.040 --> 03:16.691
And he is a controlling
board member of Eden Field,

03:16.750 --> 03:19.742
which legally makes him

03:19.790 --> 03:22.862
two-thirds participant
in GenCoin.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.495
-No.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.609
No. That's bullshit.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.651
He didn't tell me that part.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.113
-It's fully disclosed
in Eden Field's contract
with GenCoin.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.696
-"Contract"?
He didn't show me that!

03:34.750 --> 03:36.149
-He didn't have to.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.361
And he knew
you wouldn't ask for it.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.406
Isabelle...

03:42.830 --> 03:45.651
why you didn't bring
this to me?

03:45.700 --> 03:48.112
-All I could think about was
this was the dude.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.242
This guy,
he had the money,

03:50.290 --> 03:52.246
and he was
gonna make It real.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.360
-I'm really sorry about this.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.031
-All right, go ahead
and put it on the hood.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.030
Hey, Gilles, count that.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.035
-Okay.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.321
-So I take it Alex didn't want
to show, huh?

05:09.370 --> 05:12.578
-He's spread a little thin
at the moment,

05:12.620 --> 05:14.656
but he sends his regards.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.691
-I'll bet you he do.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.991
-Hey, hold up, though.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.110
This seem like
only about 300 in here.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.942
-You know it 'posed to be 450.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.946
-We were unable to get
that amount approved.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.321
-Are you sure you want it
to go down like this?

05:39.370 --> 05:40.860
-Try to understand, Ron.
GenCoin--

05:40.910 --> 05:43.037
-No, I understand
that you short.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.490
That's what I understand.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.992
-You're welcome
to call your lavwer.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.190
Otherwise, I'd let this one be.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.150
-Bravo!

09:21.790 --> 09:23.405
-Permiso.

09:23.450 --> 09:25.577
Are you guarding the stash?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.786
Isabelita, huh?

09:29.790 --> 09:32.031
What a job your mom did.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.742
Must have been
a lot of chaos around here.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.610
-Yeah.
-I know Marta.
I know her.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.742
-Yeah, she--
she took it very seriously.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.075
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.496
-How have you been?

09:41.540 --> 09:45.863
I feel like I didn't see you
since you came from...

09:45.910 --> 09:47.616
California, right?

09:48.620 --> 09:50.997
-Just workin' on new stuff.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.611
-Como que "new stuff"?
Como que "new stuff"?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.150
Aye, mi amor.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.159
Your dad told me that
you start your own company!

09:59.200 --> 10:01.248
Something about tech, right?

10:01.290 --> 10:02.996
-Mm-hmm.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.362
-Yes, yes, he told me you have
a big, fancy office
and everything.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.741
-Um...

10:07.790 --> 10:09.576
I'm gonna go take this...

10:09.620 --> 10:11.076
-To your boyfriend?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.405
I will meet...

10:36.580 --> 10:38.992
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:40.410 --> 10:42.696
-You stashing
Papi's beer again?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.940
-No, I just...

10:46.000 --> 10:47.536
needed a minute.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.241
-We're cutting the cake
in a bit though, all right?

10:52.290 --> 10:53.496
-Yeah.

10:53.540 --> 10:54.825
I'll be there.

10:59.290 --> 11:00.609
Delly?

11:00.660 --> 11:01.786
-Yea h?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.689
-You look beautiful.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.110
-I know.

13:16.910 --> 13:19.447
You should try
locking the side gate.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.695
-What's wrong
with the front door?

13:21.750 --> 13:23.695
-I didn't think
you would open.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.529
I, uh...

13:27.790 --> 13:29.860
I have some things
I need to say.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.821
I need to explain myself.

13:31.870 --> 13:32.859
-Oh, yeah?

13:36.370 --> 13:37.746
-I'm sorry.

13:37.790 --> 13:39.189
Okay? Um...

13:40.910 --> 13:41.990
I'm sorry.

13:42.040 --> 13:42.995
-Great.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.530
Everything's better then.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.116
-Let me explain myself.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.491
-I think you know
what you're gonna say.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.030
-No, I got pushed out
too, Nick.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.571
I'm out of my own thing.
I'm done.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.400
-Oh.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.907
-He brought in
a third partner.
-Mm-hmm.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.032
-This, uh, server farm.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.117
A network management company.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.946
It turns out that
he owns it, too.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.537
-Which makes him
a majority,

14:07.580 --> 14:10.117
then he single-handedly
voted me out.

14:12.910 --> 14:17.028
The lawyers called it
a hostile takeover.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.899
-Yeah, it's a thing.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.820
-He owns my code.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.576
GenCoin.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.692
My life's work,
it's his just like that.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.820
-Well, that sucks.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.531
-Yeah. Anyway--

14:37.580 --> 14:39.741
-Yeah, anyway,
now you're sorry,
'cause you've got nothing.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.997
-I tried to bring
you guys back in.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.610
-Mm-hmm.
-I tried.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.537
But everything was a mess
and you know that.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.615
I didn't know
what to do.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.322
I just wanted GenCoin to work.

14:49.370 --> 14:50.655
That's all I cared about.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.658
It was bigger than you
or me or Ronnie or--

14:53.700 --> 14:55.827
-Okay, I hope that
makes you feel better.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.610
Let me show you
the front door.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.618
-Maybe if you wouldn't have
treated me like a fucking
crazy person,

15:00.660 --> 15:02.787
and had some respect for me--
-You are a fucking
crazy person!

15:02.830 --> 15:05.492
-You don't know me!
-I know you're fucking crazy!

15:05.540 --> 15:07.747
-You don't know nothing.
You know why? Because
you have all of this.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.280
-You don't know fucking
me either, all right?

15:09.330 --> 15:11.241
So watch what you say.
-Rich white people problems!

15:11.290 --> 15:13.440
-You don't know me
and you don't know
what I've been through.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.865
You have no idea
what I've been through.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.946
-Boo fucking hoo.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.319
Your daddy ran out on you.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.440
-Don't fucking say that.
Don't fucking say that.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.400
-What's wrong?
-I don't know you,
you don't know me,

15:22.450 --> 15:23.860
and I don't know
what goes inside your--

17:28.450 --> 17:29.690
-Come on, son.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.492
You let your old man
work you like that?

17:34.160 --> 17:35.195
Come on.

17:36.790 --> 17:37.996
Come on.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.650
Come on. Hey, hey,
try again. Try again.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.246
Back me down.

17:51.290 --> 17:52.689
Back me down.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.405
A'ight.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.031
Try to stop me, a'ight?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.866
Just try to stop me.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.249
-Why you let that bitch
play you like that?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.536
-The hell you talking, boy?

18:22.580 --> 18:25.071
-The girl who come up
in here in the Escalade,

18:25.120 --> 18:27.611
showed us
a whole bunch of bills.

18:27.660 --> 18:28.900
-It's complicated.

18:29.910 --> 18:31.150
That's all I'll say.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.496
-Ain't you the man now?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.036
Ain't this your hood?

18:40.330 --> 18:42.195
And you gonna let
some white bitch

18:42.250 --> 18:45.287
roll up in here
and diss you like that?

18:45.330 --> 18:46.786
-That white bitch,

18:46.830 --> 18:48.491
she clipped up
with the Russians.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.570
Now, I'mma get that money.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.747
But you gotta be smart
about that shit there.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.110
-Yeah, Pap. Whatever.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.610
-Don't "whatever" me.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.616
All right?

19:07.660 --> 19:10.788
_ 'Cause this some
serious ass shit right here.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.650
Stone cold.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.940
You gotta know
when to be the man...

19:17.410 --> 19:19.071
and when to be
the bigger man.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.576
You feel me?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.786
-Should have murked them all.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.406
-That's all I'm sayin'.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.821
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.826
-I should have killed them all?
-Yup.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.077
-Just killed
everybody there, huh?
-Yup.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.157
-Just bap, bap, bap, bap?
Just killed all them, huh?

19:45.200 --> 19:46.997
-Yup.
-Just shot 'em dead, huh?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.439
-Shot 'em dead.
-Shoot 'em in the face!

19:48.500 --> 19:49.990
Should've killed them
like that, huh?
-Yeah.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.325
-Ki|led 'em dead, right?

19:51.370 --> 19:52.780
They ain't here no more.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.570
They're gone.
I should have just
killed them, right?

19:54.620 --> 19:56.997
-You should have shot them
in the face!

20:07.830 --> 20:08.819
-Son, it's okay.

20:08.870 --> 20:11.361
You did what you had to do.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.037
You understand this?

20:13.080 --> 20:15.287
You did what you had to do.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.861
You did what you had to do.

20:20.870 --> 20:21.939
A'ight?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.399
You did right.

20:28.540 --> 20:31.156
--Just let that shit out.

20:32.450 --> 20:34.998
No, no, no, no,
it's all right.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.780
That's my boy right here.

20:39.790 --> 20:42.657
--This my boy right here.

20:50.870 --> 20:52.940
-You all right?
I'll be right back, all right?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.446
You did good.
You did good.

20:57.660 --> 21:00.242
The hell she doin' here?

21:00.290 --> 21:02.281
- We have to talk.
- Just hear us out.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.946
-Listen, we all need to talk.
-Hey, Nick, what is she--
come on, man.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.945
-I know.
-It's ridiculous right here.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.116
What's ridiculous?
- You being here. You know
what you did.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.321
Come on now, Nick.
You got some explaining to do.
-I'm sorry.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.746
He doesn't have to
explain anything.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.246
I'm sorry.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.280
I am sorry

21:17.330 --> 21:19.366
for what I did,
and "sorry" doesn't cut it,

21:19.410 --> 21:21.492
and I know that,
but I have no other words

21:21.540 --> 21:23.690
other than "I am sorry."

21:23.750 --> 21:26.401
This right here is GenCoin.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.908
There's no GenCoin
without you.

21:30.950 --> 21:32.861
-We had a plan
to get the company back.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.444
You want in?

24:27.040 --> 24:28.576
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:31.540 --> 24:33.155
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.030
I'll see you in the morning.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.399
-'Kay.

24:59.450 --> 25:03.534
-I moved Eden Field to 11:00,
so you could get some rest.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.286
-I'm fine.

25:10.950 --> 25:12.281
What?

25:14.870 --> 25:17.247
-It had to happen.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.781
We gave her fair chance.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.158
-Some dogs can't be chained.

25:57.830 --> 25:59.786
She would have bitten us all.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.746
Maybe just you.

26:25.370 --> 26:26.780
-Vera?

26:30.120 --> 26:32.657
GenCoin can't wind up
like the others.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.149
-It won't.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.195
Hi.

27:11.410 --> 27:14.368
-So this the little nigga
who took our cash.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.248
-Chain of title
for all of Alex's shells.

27:19.290 --> 27:21.440
Plus, a paper trail
for every single dollar

27:21.500 --> 27:24.572
that he's made, spent,
or invested since 2002.

27:24.620 --> 27:27.032
-She even hacked
all his porn accounts
from college.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.399
-That was just for fun.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.116
-Nice work.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.320
How'd you get it?

27:32.370 --> 27:34.691
-I hacked his shit
way before you came to us.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.286
-Our girl got trust issues.

27:37.540 --> 27:40.111
-So... what's the catch?

27:40.160 --> 27:41.570
The catch...

27:41.620 --> 27:44.532
is that you're not gonna use
that to blackmail him.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.865
You...

27:45.910 --> 27:47.571
work for us now.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.030
You're gonna use it
to bring him down

27:49.080 --> 27:51.241
without implicating us
in any legal activity.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.491
I don't think you understand
how this works.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.746
- We don't?
- No.

27:55.790 --> 27:56.939
Hm...

27:57.000 --> 28:00.037
Ronnie, do-- do we not know
how this works?

28:00.080 --> 28:02.537
-Shit, girl. I don't know.
I don't know, man.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.241
Are we just--

28:04.290 --> 28:06.326
does he got the drop
on us, Nick?

28:06.370 --> 28:08.611
-Oh, it's tough to say.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.901
Super hard.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.157
Let me know when you're ready.
I'll press play.

28:15.370 --> 28:16.610
-What is that?

28:17.660 --> 28:19.070
Listen. Put it on.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.439
-Why?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.491
-Why don't you listen
and then we'll talk?

28:23.830 --> 28:26.822
-Just listen to
the motherfucking tape.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.406
-This your demo?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.536
Yeah, please.

28:39.290 --> 28:42.157
I'm sorry?
You kill
the girl yet?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.497
What?

28:44.910 --> 28:46.571
You kill the girl yet?

28:47.790 --> 28:49.155
You ever ask me that again,

28:49.200 --> 28:50.747
I'm gonna put
a bullet through your head.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.360
I don't want you asking
me that again.

28:53.870 --> 28:55.531
- She saw me.
- Yeah, I know.

28:55.580 --> 28:57.741
- She see this. She see you.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

28:57.790 --> 28:59.075
I know. _
You're a genIus.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.156
You let me deal
with that, all right?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.940
You deal with getting me
my fucking money.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.742
We're gonna probably
need to scale up the team
pretty soon.

30:01.790 --> 30:03.246
I want at least
two new people

30:03.290 --> 30:04.939
who are solely dedicated
to interfacing with Mimi

30:05.000 --> 30:06.570
about network management
on both ends.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.827
-I have a guy
who's based here
if you want to meet him.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.440
He flies back
and forth to Austin,

30:10.500 --> 30:12.695
so he knows some of
the Eden Field people already.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.490
-I'd love to meet_ him
as soon as possmle.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.782
-Are you still aiming
to launch on the second?

30:17.830 --> 30:19.286
-Ideally.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.241
But the beta hasn't been proven
across all platforms yet,

30:21.290 --> 30:23.190
and I still--
It'll work.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.576
We'll test it,
and it'll work.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.748
So we can launch
on the second.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.823
-Yes, well, Nico says
we can launch on the second.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.740
-Hi.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.576
-If we wanted to launch
on the second,

30:47.620 --> 30:50.157
how many transactions per day
do you think we'd be ready
to host?

30:50.200 --> 30:51.940
-We||, we'd have to
scale up way quicker.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.036
Um, it's not impossible.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.195
Just takes money.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.990
-'Kay, well, we have money.

31:03.580 --> 31:06.151
Sorry, guys.
Uh, one sec.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.826
-Hey.
-Alex.

31:15.870 --> 31:17.690
-I know.
Uh, Phil Rask.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.320
FBI, Financial Crimes.

31:19.370 --> 31:21.782
- Nice to meet you, Phil Rask.
- You too.

31:23.660 --> 31:25.241
-Uh, if you could...

31:29.830 --> 31:31.991
- Excuse the interruption.
- I know you're busy.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.497
-Oh, uh, no, it's okay.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.440
Can-- uh, did Vera ask
if you want--

31:36.500 --> 31:38.070
-She did, thank you.
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.075
-Okay then.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.031
What, uh...

31:44.870 --> 31:46.576
And how-- how can I help?

31:46.620 --> 31:47.939
-I need money.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.247
-Yeah, I know about Minsk.

31:55.790 --> 31:57.360
I know about Helsinki.

31:57.410 --> 31:58.866
-I-- I'm--

31:58.910 --> 32:00.320
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:00.370 --> 32:01.906
-Don't fuck with me.

32:01.950 --> 32:05.033
I have over 400 pages
of documents linking you

32:05.080 --> 32:07.571
directly to Kostya Vetrov
and Mark Yegorov.

32:08.700 --> 32:09.780
I have those.

32:09.830 --> 32:11.786
Not FinCEN. Not the FBI.
Not the CIA.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.821
Me and me alone.

32:16.450 --> 32:18.281
-Are-- are...

32:19.950 --> 32:21.611
I don't understand.
Are you blackmail--

32:21.660 --> 32:23.116
-I'm blackmailing you. Yeah.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.196
Now, I'm going to assume

32:26.250 --> 32:29.651
that somewhere here
you have a reserve of cash.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.655
-Uh...

32:32.410 --> 32:33.570
-Good.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.441
Well, I want all of it
in there right now.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.860
-I--
-Shut up.

32:39.910 --> 32:41.650
Be smart, okay?

32:45.120 --> 32:46.747
-And you'll leave me alone?

33:16.290 --> 33:17.609
You have to help me.

33:22.910 --> 33:24.320
Please.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.031
Help me.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.326
Make them go away.

33:34.910 --> 33:36.286
-Pleasure.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.439
Who gave you this?

35:04.750 --> 35:07.196
Who gave you this shit?

35:58.620 --> 36:01.748
- Okay.
- The yard is finally
back to normal.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.247
-Thank god.
-It only took two days.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.190
Hey, what time
is your flight, nena?

36:06.250 --> 36:08.286
Nena?
At 3:00. At 3:00.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.742
But I have to get back soon
'cause I'm sure Eddie still
hasn't packed yet.

36:10.790 --> 36:12.439
-I'm so jealous.
I mean, we haven't gone away

36:12.500 --> 36:13.944
on a trip in forever,
right, Papi?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.490
-What about the Bahamas?
-Oh, my God.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.405
-That was our honeymoon, okay?

36:17.450 --> 36:19.441
-I know.
-Hey, it's all
I could afford.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.195
How about Italy? Hm?

36:21.250 --> 36:23.400
-How about Italy?
-I'm gonna have some more
of this ham right here.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.532
- It's prosciutto.

36:25.580 --> 36:28.993
-Oh, my--
why don't we go to Italy?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.996
-Okay, but you're gonna
have to be very nice.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.780
-Oh, my God.
-When are we going?

36:32.830 --> 36:34.149
-Nevuary.
-Soon.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.111
- You think that's funny?

37:15.870 --> 37:18.111
- What do you think?
- She's not joking. What do you--

37:18.160 --> 37:19.650
-You know what?
They should have
gone to Cuba.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.248
-What is she gonna do in Cuba?
She can smoke weed in Jamaica.

37:22.290 --> 37:24.941
-Come on, honey.
-She's right, Mom.
It's something different.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.490
- Can you imagine Eddie?

37:26.540 --> 37:27.939
He'd never make it back.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.399
He'd forget his name,
that poor guy.

37:29.450 --> 37:30.690
--That was a good joke.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.035
-No, Mom, I'm serious.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.447
-I gotta take this because
Jamaican me crazy.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.115
-That's not funny, baby.
That's not funny.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.570
-What do you think
they're gonna be doing?

37:38.620 --> 37:40.281
She's gonna bang.

37:40.330 --> 37:41.945
-You guys, I should go.
I should get back.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.285
- They're going to.
- Yes.

37:43.330 --> 37:44.991
-Don't touch me.
I'm gonna get cake.

37:51.750 --> 37:53.615
- That shit was good.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.326
-Delly?

38:00.870 --> 38:02.076
Delly?

38:03.120 --> 38:05.441
No,no,no!

38:08.250 --> 38:09.569
Adolfo! Adolfo!

38:12.330 --> 38:16.243
-What happened?
What happened?
-Call someone! Call someone!

38:16.290 --> 38:17.496
Call someone!

38:17.540 --> 38:19.997
- Call somebody.
- Miguel, call somebody.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.905
No, Delfia.

38:25.790 --> 38:28.190
Delfi, no...

38:53.790 --> 38:56.031
Hey, kid, if you
don't face this now...

39:14.040 --> 39:15.610
I remember my first.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.786
I was a minute
younger than you.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.901
I still remember the smell
of the heat on my fingertips.

39:28.790 --> 39:30.439
That shit...

39:32.830 --> 39:34.786
That shit wouldn't go away.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.241
I remember...

39:41.370 --> 39:43.497
I remember smelling it
when I went to take a bite

39:43.540 --> 39:46.327
of this ham sandwich
my old girl made me.

39:47.790 --> 39:51.692
And I remember thinking,
saying to myself...

39:53.910 --> 39:57.073
"This the first time I'm eating
as a person who killed someone."

40:00.120 --> 40:02.862
I remember taking
a shower thinking...

40:04.120 --> 40:05.189
thinking the same thing.

40:05.250 --> 40:08.947
"This the first shower...

40:10.500 --> 40:12.036
since becoming a killer."

40:15.250 --> 40:17.320
I remember riding a bike.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.366
First time playing ball.

40:22.540 --> 40:24.861
First time, first time.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.786
All as this new person.

40:30.160 --> 40:34.324
And the funny thing is,
the nigga that I killed,

40:34.370 --> 40:36.656
I don't even
remember hIs name.

40:53.330 --> 40:55.366
- Hey.

40:55.410 --> 40:56.741
Nick.

41:04.330 --> 41:06.286
I remember I shot him
'cause I had to.

41:06.330 --> 41:07.866
It was me or him.

41:09.330 --> 41:11.241
But after I squeezed
that trigger...

41:12.750 --> 41:15.116
I let that shit change me.

41:17.330 --> 41:20.242
Get inside my bones
like some cancer

41:20.290 --> 41:22.747
all up and through every part
of who I was.

41:22.790 --> 41:25.190
I let my sin define me,

41:25.250 --> 41:27.696
grind me down

41:27.750 --> 41:30.696
to the man I thought
I 'posed to be.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.906
But you ain't got
to do that, son.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.365
This town...

41:42.750 --> 41:44.035
it's what you make it.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.656
You need to know that.

41:49.330 --> 41:50.399
You got a choice.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.536
We all got choice.

41:53.580 --> 41:55.070
Life about choice.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.532
And the choices I make,

41:58.580 --> 42:00.946
they ain't always
gonna be pretty.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.993
Hell, matter of fact,
sometimes they gonna be ugly.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.537
There's gonna be people
gunning for us.

42:09.580 --> 42:10.820
And I ain't talkin'
about them kids

42:13.000 --> 42:14.319
or even them Towners,
dawg.

42:14.370 --> 42:16.190
I'm talking
a whole lot worse.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.328
'Cause here,
where we at...

42:25.120 --> 42:27.941
every move you make,
it come with a price.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.741
-So He will knock them down...

42:30.790 --> 42:33.156
And you got to be willing
to pay that price...

42:36.160 --> 42:37.696
...and move on...

42:41.290 --> 42:43.281
Hear the sound
of my prayers...

42:43.330 --> 42:46.367
...and know that
it's worth every tear.

42:46.410 --> 42:47.946
I raise my hands...

42:49.040 --> 42:50.689
Every ounce of sweat.

42:51.950 --> 42:53.690
Don't drag me away...

42:53.750 --> 42:56.150
Every drop of blood.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.036
'Cause this ain't
America, kid.

43:01.660 --> 43:05.699
This here is Miami.

43:37.120 --> 43:40.362
- Got my own monster

43:40.410 --> 43:42.492
Nobody but me

43:44.000 --> 43:47.401
I would never
call him enemy

43:47.450 --> 43:50.863
He's the bad god I need

43:50.910 --> 43:54.198
Losing my boundaries

43:54.250 --> 43:57.538
Setting me free

43:57.580 --> 44:00.868
Oh, in my dreams
he speaks to me

44:00.910 --> 44:04.289
He's the bad god I need

44:05.790 --> 44:08.497
He's the bad god I need

44:17.250 --> 44:19.650
Monster

44:19.700 --> 44:23.284
He's the bad god I need

44:23.330 --> 44:26.242
I got my own monster

44:26.290 --> 44:28.611
He's the bad god I need

44:30.750 --> 44:33.401
Monster

44:33.450 --> 44:36.863
He's the bad god I need

44:36.910 --> 44:39.287
I got my own monster

44:39.330 --> 44:42.572
He's the bad god I need
