WEBVTT

00:15.516 --> 00:17.177
We got a little chop ahead.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.853
Put that away, man.
You're freaking me out.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.771
We need this thing.

00:24.859 --> 00:28.898
With the cargo we got
back there? Bad mojo.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.195
- Ms. Decker?
- Yes.

00:31.282 --> 00:35.241
- Wanna let 'em know we're landing?
- Sure. Of course.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.831
We're coming in for a landing.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.962
It's a military facility
just west of Honolulu.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.013
It's completely private.

01:00.311 --> 01:03.018
Your families are already here.

01:05.858 --> 01:09.021
Now, there's a lot of press
that want to speak to you.

01:09.111 --> 01:14.697
But as far as Oceanic is concerned, you
don't have to speak to any reporters.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.955
We'll talk to 'em.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.211
Is that all right with all of you?

01:27.296 --> 01:31.209
It's fine. We all agreed.
We just want to get it over with.

01:31.300 --> 01:36.590
OK. Um, they're referring to you
as the "Oceanic Six."

01:36.681 --> 01:40.924
Not the best branding as far
as we're concerned, but it's catchy.

01:42.687 --> 01:44.518
We'll see you on the ground.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.231
We all know the story.

01:57.326 --> 02:01.660
If we get any questions that we don't
want to answer, or that we can't answer,

02:01.747 --> 02:04.124
let's just keep our mouths shut.

02:09.005 --> 02:11.792
It's OK. They'll think
that we're in shock.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.625
We are in shock, Jack.

02:16.846 --> 02:20.134
Well, then this should be easy.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.669
[cooing]

04:48.747 --> 04:52.581
[Rose] It was Sayid and Desmond
in the helicopter, right?

04:52.668 --> 04:53.908
I mean, it had to be.

04:54.003 --> 04:57.837
Why else would they have dropped
that thingamabob right over us?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.665
- Then why wouldn't they just land?
- I don't know,

05:00.759 --> 05:04.923
but this is tracking the chopper. They
want us to know where they're going.

05:05.014 --> 05:08.131
It's a phone, right?
Can't we just call?

05:08.225 --> 05:11.638
- [electronic beeping]
- Well?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.771
Don't try anything stupid.

05:16.859 --> 05:17.894
Understood.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.322
[beeping]

05:27.119 --> 05:29.326
- [Keamy] Put her down over there.
- Is that the chopper?

05:29.413 --> 05:32.075
[Lapidus] You sure?
We ’re still ﬁve k/icks from the site.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.157
[Keamy] / said put her down, Frank!

05:34.251 --> 05:36.993
OK, gear up, boys. We hit the ground,
we deploy to the Orchid.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.170
Heads down. Let's do this.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.299
- You know what the Orchid is?
- [Juliet] No.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.128
I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.259
Kate.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.849
- You wanna take a walk?
- Absolutely.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.352
- I'll get the guns. You get some water.
- OK.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.647
You can't possibly be serious.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.694
- You just had surgery.
- I'll be fine.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.649
- If your sutures rip, you won't be.
- I can't sit around...

06:07.743 --> 06:10.405
- Recovery is not sitting around!
- l have to do this.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.863
- Why?
- Because I promised those people

06:13.958 --> 06:17.121
that I would get them off this island.

06:18.254 --> 06:20.461
Don't bleed to death, Jack.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.550
I'll see you in a couple hours.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.301
Daniel?

06:31.392 --> 06:33.883
- What's wrong?
- Charlotte, did you hear what he said?

06:33.978 --> 06:37.391
They're going to the Orchid.
Using the secondary protocol.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.722
What are you talking about?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.817
We have to get off this island...

06:52.162 --> 06:53.993
...right now.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.512
[beeping]

07:12.349 --> 07:15.307
We're catching up.
The chopper must have landed.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.931
Why don't you take a break?

07:18.022 --> 07:21.105
[Jack panting]

07:21.191 --> 07:22.977
[beeping]

07:35.497 --> 07:36.907
You're bleeding.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.123
No, I'm not bleeding.
l'm... l'm suppurating.

07:40.210 --> 07:45.830
lt's discharge. My body is just fighting
an infection around the stitches.

07:45.924 --> 07:50.293
You know when most people are lying
and they can't look you in the eye?

07:50.387 --> 07:52.673
You do the exact opposite.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.136
[branch breaks]

07:58.395 --> 07:59.896
[footsteps approaching]

08:09.031 --> 08:10.316
Hey, long time no see.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.819
[Aaron crying]

08:12.910 --> 08:15.401
Who are you talkin' to
up there, Genghis?

08:31.929 --> 08:33.089
Where's Claire?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.131
We lost her.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.842
You what?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.349
She walked off
in the middle of the night.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.024
We looked for her for a day,
but she was just gone.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.818
l was hoping maybe she
went back to the beach.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.691
She didn't.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.864
[Aaron cries]

08:53.951 --> 08:56.408
What are you all doing out here?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.201
What is that phone for?

08:58.288 --> 09:01.280
Chopper flew over the beach.
Someone tossed this out.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.491
I think it must have been Sayid.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.452
Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.710
If he's with those animals
who blew up half of New Otherton,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.791
you do not wanna tussle with 'em.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.754
They tried to kill you?

09:14.805 --> 09:16.887
Just like Locke said they would.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.723
So, what, we're supposed
to just turn around and hide?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.772
'Cause it seems like
that didn't work so well for you.

09:26.859 --> 09:31.068
Didn't you just do the "run through
the jungle with a walkie" plan?

09:31.155 --> 09:34.022
That helicopter
is our only way off this island.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.903
What's with you
and gettin' off the island?

09:36.994 --> 09:40.612
Stop it! You two
fighting each other now?

09:45.169 --> 09:48.536
Look, I put Sayid and Desmond
on that chopper.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.669
It was my call. It's my responsibility.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.844
I'm going after it,
whether they're on it or not.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.091
- You can all head back to the beach.
- Jack.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.973
No, no, no. You can't go by yourself.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.769
Just take care of the baby, OK?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.328
- That son of a bitch is stubborn.
- [cocking gun]

10:20.412 --> 10:23.575
Hold up! You don't get to die alone.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.749
[Decker] Based on the location
of the wreckage,

10:30.881 --> 10:35.250
our best estimate
of the crash site is here.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.800
From there, the survivors

10:36.887 --> 10:41.927
were carried
by the ocean's current to here.

10:42.017 --> 10:47.262
An uninhabited island in the
Lesser Sunda lslands known as Membata.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.597
As you all read in your briefing books,

10:49.691 --> 10:52.899
on day 103, a typhoon

10:52.986 --> 10:56.103
washed up the remnants
of an Indonesian fishing boat,

10:56.198 --> 10:59.782
including basic supplies
and a survival raft.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.986
On day 108, the remaining six survivors,

11:04.081 --> 11:09.872
including Ms. Austen's baby, which she
gave birth to on the island of Membata,

11:09.962 --> 11:14.672
used this raft to journey here,
an island called Sumba.

11:14.758 --> 11:18.467
They then came ashore near
a village called Manukangga.

11:18.554 --> 11:22.342
This photo was taken
by the local fishermen who found them.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.924
Once it was discovered who they were,

11:25.018 --> 11:28.510
they were then transported
to Honolulu by the US. Coast Guard.

11:28.605 --> 11:33.599
As you can imagine, this has been
an extraordinarily trying experience.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.982
They have, however,
agreed to answer a few questions,

11:37.072 --> 11:41.691
so, ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.525
[excited clamor]

11:43.620 --> 11:45.531
Dr. Shephard! Dr. Shephard!

11:45.622 --> 11:48.864
Can you tell us what it was like
when the plane hit the ocean,

11:48.959 --> 11:50.449
how you survived?

11:52.129 --> 11:53.915
Um...

11:54.840 --> 11:59.675
lt... it happened really fast.
I remember the impact.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.798
I remember the plane
filling up with water.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.098
A group of us got to the emergency door

12:07.185 --> 12:09.892
and, um, got out before it went down.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.438
And those of you who survived
you swam to the island?

12:14.318 --> 12:19.688
No. We had, uh, cushions,
we had some life jackets.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.649
We were in the water for over a day
before the current took us in.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.110
By then, there were
only eight of us left.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.328
What happened to the other three?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.158
One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle,

12:32.252 --> 12:36.461
suffered tremendous internal injuries
and died a few days after the crash.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.540
A woman, Libby,

12:39.635 --> 12:41.967
she didn't make it through
the first week.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.466
Charlie Pace,

12:44.556 --> 12:48.219
he drowned a few weeks
before we were able to leave.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.392
[reporters clamoring]

12:50.479 --> 12:52.561
[woman] Mr. Reyes, you were worth

12:52.648 --> 12:56.482
more than $150 million
at the time of your... "death".

12:56.568 --> 12:59.526
How does it feel to know
you'll get that money back?

12:59.613 --> 13:02.025
I don't want it back. Any of it.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.656
That money was bad luck.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.280
[speaking in Korean]

13:09.665 --> 13:11.997
[man] Can somebody translate that?

13:13.835 --> 13:17.748
She asked me if my husband was one
of the people who died on the island.

13:26.723 --> 13:31.467
The answer is no.
He never made it off the plane.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.348
Are you aware of the situation
in Iraq, Mr. Jarrah?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.225
Do you have any plans to return?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.812
There is nothing for me in Iraq.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.361
And Mr. Shephard, now that
you are home, what are your plans?

13:44.282 --> 13:46.819
I haven't really thought
too much about it.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.985
My father died in Sydney.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.823
l was bringing him home for the funeral
when the plane crashed.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.201
Even though the body is...

13:58.672 --> 14:00.458
I'd like to put him to rest.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.584
Ms. Austen?

14:03.719 --> 14:06.882
What was it like
giving birth on the island?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.132
Scary.

14:08.223 --> 14:11.966
Your son, Aaron? How old is he?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.517
Just a little over five weeks.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.141
So that would've made you
six months pregnant

14:17.232 --> 14:20.724
when the US. Marshal Service
apprehended you in Australia

14:20.819 --> 14:23.060
for an outstanding murder warrant?

14:23.155 --> 14:27.489
I'm afraid Ms. Austen's legal issue
is off the table. Next question.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.192
Mr. Jarrah, given
the amazing circumstances

14:30.287 --> 14:33.154
surrounding the survival
of you six, is it possible

14:33.248 --> 14:37.787
there are any other survivors
from the crash yet to be discovered?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.914
No. Absolutely not.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.542
[reporters shouting]

14:47.971 --> 14:49.427
You did good.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.803
Mr. Jarrah?

14:56.480 --> 14:57.890
There's a woman outside.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.189
Says she knows you but wasn't
on our list of family members.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.018
Her name is Noor Abed Jaseem.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.339
Nadia?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.462
Nadia.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.715
[Jin] Hey! Over here!

16:12.889 --> 16:14.265
Sayid!

16:14.349 --> 16:15.714
Where's Desmond?

16:15.809 --> 16:19.973
He's fine, on the freighter. I'm going
to take people back, six at a time.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.851
We have to go right now, before
the helicopter gets back to the boat.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.150
Why do we have to go to the boat
before the chopper gets back?

16:27.237 --> 16:31.776
Because the men on that helicopter
have every intention of killing us all.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.406
What?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.452
Jack and Kate
just went running after it.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.504
So when is someone
gonna tell me where we're going?

16:47.591 --> 16:50.708
We're going to a place
called the Orchid, Hugo.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.042
What's that?

16:52.137 --> 16:54.048
It's a greenhouse.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.722
And why are we going
to a greenhouse, exactly?

16:57.809 --> 17:00.642
You heard John.
We're going to move the island.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.770
Right. And how are we gonna do that?

17:04.274 --> 17:06.230
Very carefully.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.481
If you could move the island
whenever you wanted,

17:09.571 --> 17:13.234
why didn't you just do it before
the psychos with the guns got here?

17:13.325 --> 17:16.442
Because doing it is
both dangerous and unpredictable.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.699
It's a measure of last resort.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.950
Awesome.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.679
Allow me.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.992
May l have that mirror, please?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.791
You know those are 15 years old.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.552
- What are you doing, dude?
- Communicating.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.226
Communicating with who?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.436
Who do you think?

18:42.163 --> 18:44.449
All right. Now we can go.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.248
Wait, what was that?
What did you tell them?

18:47.335 --> 18:50.042
None of your business, John.

19:00.223 --> 19:04.216
If you wanna run off in the jungle
after that chopper, you should do that.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.802
In the meantime we need
to get them off this island.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.887
If I can catch up to Jack and Kate...

19:08.982 --> 19:11.974
I can start ferrying people now,
get them there safely.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.777
By time you get back, I can have
most of these people on our boat.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.287
I trust you know the bearing.
You'd better get going.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.489
Thank you.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.621
All right, first group in the raft.
We can fit six!

19:30.712 --> 19:35.502
OK, OK, hold on.
Sun is pregnant. She should go first.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.927
Sayid? What are you doing here?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.177
Jack thought...

19:45.268 --> 19:47.884
That's why I'm going after him.
How far ahead is he?

19:47.979 --> 19:51.267
I don't know. He's with Sawyer.
I left them about an hour ago.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.191
Jack's got a sat-phone,
headed for the helicopter.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.312
I can track them.

19:58.156 --> 20:02.274
Look, you are not gonna catch up
to them unless I go with you.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.109
- Then let's go.
- OK.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.408
- Sun?
- Where's Claire?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.205
- Get Aaron to the boat.
- What?

20:09.292 --> 20:14.127
I'm sorry. Just... I'll see you there.
Just keep him safe!

20:18.551 --> 20:21.463
All right, this is just
the first trip. Here we go.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.237
[motor starts]

23:23.820 --> 23:25.310
[car backfires]

23:27.115 --> 23:29.572
[engine sputtering]

23:37.875 --> 23:39.615
[car backfires]

23:41.921 --> 23:43.707
Mom?

23:45.258 --> 23:46.839
Dad?

23:47.802 --> 23:50.293
- [door closes]
- [doorbell chimes]

23:52.348 --> 23:54.930
Mr. Tron? Lady Tron?

24:06.487 --> 24:10.355
[indistinct whispering]

24:12.702 --> 24:14.192
Hello?

24:26.174 --> 24:28.836
[whispering continues]

24:30.303 --> 24:33.887
Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

24:35.391 --> 24:36.767
Why am I doing this?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.974
[all] Surprise!

24:39.062 --> 24:41.394
Happy birthday!

24:41.481 --> 24:43.563
[people applauding]

24:43.900 --> 24:47.313
Hugo, what are you doing with that?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.816
I don't know, I thought
there was a prowler or something.

24:50.907 --> 24:52.568
Jesus Christ is not a weapon.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.947
OK. Enjoy your party.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.372
[Hawaiian music playing]

25:09.842 --> 25:11.582
Happy birthday, Hurley.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.835
- Hey, Kate.
- Hey.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.795
- Hey, little buddy!
- Say hi.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.176
Jack's running late.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.007
Happy Birthday, Hugo!

25:20.103 --> 25:21.764
Wow, you guys are here!

25:24.107 --> 25:25.768
Interesting choice of theme.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.770
Yeah, Mom really doesn't get it, dude.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.943
Hey, how's everybody doing?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.988
What're you talking about?
Building a fire or hunting boars?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.361
[chuckling] I guess not.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.489
Listen, do you mind excusing us
for a little while?

25:39.580 --> 25:42.242
I wanna show you your birthday present.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.745
Bye-bye now.

25:44.836 --> 25:47.703
- Told you I don't want anything.
- Hugo, it's your birthday.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.083
- You gotta get somethin'.
- Not with the money.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.631
- I don't want anything from the money.
- Relax.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.210
I got you this before
you gave us the money.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.046
Ta-da! Check it out.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.599
You fixed it.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.976
Yeah. After the crash,

26:08.067 --> 26:12.151
I worked on it as a memorial to you.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.321
When lwas fixing it up,
it was almost like I was with you.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.408
But now you're back. And it's all yours.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.827
Wanna take her for a little spin?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.130
Something wrong, son?

26:40.224 --> 26:41.839
Is this some kind ofjoke?

26:42.769 --> 26:46.762
- What're you talking about?
- Four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.721
Did you do this?

26:48.816 --> 26:50.022
Do what?

26:50.109 --> 26:53.772
Those are the numbers! There!
The numbers I won the lottery with!

26:53.863 --> 26:55.353
Wow, what a coincidence.

26:55.448 --> 27:00.192
No! No, not a coincidence. I don't
want this! I don't want any of it!

27:00.286 --> 27:02.493
Hugo, wait a minute. Hugo. Son!

27:04.916 --> 27:09.535
Hugo. Hugo, come on,
where are you going? Hugo!

27:10.838 --> 27:14.922
OK. So let's say this greenhouse place
does what you say.

27:15.009 --> 27:18.297
And I get it,
it's really dangerous and unpredictable.

27:18.387 --> 27:22.630
But suppose somehow it works,
and we move the island.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.182
Doesn't that mean the dudes
with guns move too?

27:25.269 --> 27:26.679
Yes, I suppose they would.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.807
Isn't that, you know, a problem?

27:28.898 --> 27:30.684
I'm working on it.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.232
Well, what about me?
I still wanna get off it!

27:33.319 --> 27:35.935
I'm afraid it's a little late
for that, Hugo.

27:45.957 --> 27:48.323
May I have the binoculars, please?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.584
You might want to get
down lower to the ground.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.541
And why might we want to do that?

27:55.258 --> 27:57.374
Because we're at the Orchid.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.726
What are we waiting for?

28:12.817 --> 28:15.058
We're waiting
because Charles Widmore,

28:15.152 --> 28:18.019
the man trying to capture me
and kill the rest of you,

28:18.114 --> 28:21.857
knows about this place
and knows what we need is inside.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.911
I thought you said you had no idea
why he was trying to find the island.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.956
- I wasn't being entirely truthful.
- Yeah.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.454
When are you ever entirely truthful?

28:33.629 --> 28:35.460
You need to see this.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.673
What am I looking for?

28:39.760 --> 28:43.719
Look over there, on the left side.
Watch the plants at the back.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.307
[Locke] I don't see any...

28:51.105 --> 28:52.970
They're already here.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.826
Hey!

29:17.840 --> 29:19.205
Hey, we're back!

29:31.187 --> 29:32.267
Where's Sayid?

29:32.355 --> 29:34.311
He had to go after Jack.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.481
They're headed for the chopper.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.067
- You OK?
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.866
I'm going back for the next group.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.332
[man] Engine's fixed.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.257
Tell Hendricks to try it.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.268
OK. Engines should be working.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.410
[boat motor starts]

30:29.453 --> 30:30.954
Indeed they are.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.743
All right, well, take us to the island.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.877
But make sure you stay
on a bearing of 305.

30:39.964 --> 30:42.046
It gotta be exactly 305.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.588
We've got some kind of RF interference
with the Fathometer.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.510
I can't see the reef, mate.

30:48.597 --> 30:53.432
RF interference? How is that possible?
The radio room's down.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.352
I don't know, but something
on this boat is broadcasting.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.679
If we don't turn it off,

30:57.773 --> 31:00.890
I'm not going any closer
than five miles off the coast.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.270
Then I'll find it.

31:05.114 --> 31:08.572
[steady beeping]

31:10.453 --> 31:12.444
Cut yourself shavin'?

31:14.123 --> 31:17.365
Juliet took out my appendix
a couple days ago.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.293
- You kidding me?
- Nope.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.295
Well, what else did I miss?

31:23.382 --> 31:24.792
[beeping continues]

31:26.260 --> 31:29.002
[metal clanking]

31:29.096 --> 31:30.427
We're here.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.025
Lapidus!

31:49.742 --> 31:51.107
Yeah!

31:52.161 --> 31:53.776
You know this yahoo?

31:53.871 --> 31:55.782
- Yeah.
- Yahoo?

31:55.873 --> 32:00.537
This yahoo dropped that phone
on you guys so you could find me,

32:00.628 --> 32:02.289
and I could fly you outta here.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.997
So why don't you do me a favor
and get in that back compartment.

32:06.092 --> 32:09.926
There's a toolbox, see if you can find
something to get me outta these.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.047
You heard the man.

32:11.514 --> 32:15.302
Can I get you boys a nice cold glass
of lemonade while I'm back there?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.928
Where are Desmond and Sayid?

32:17.019 --> 32:19.351
They were smart enough
to stay on the boat.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.679
Right now that's the safest place to be.

32:24.026 --> 32:27.644
When the boys I brought over here
come stompin' out of this jungle,

32:27.738 --> 32:31.276
- you're gonna want to be long gone.
- Where'd they go?

32:31.367 --> 32:34.905
Up by some greenhouse. Perched
up there waiting to snatch Linus.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.071
We cut you free,
you'll fly us out of here?

32:38.165 --> 32:40.656
- Hell, yeah.
- Hang on, Shaggy.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.742
The hit squad's grabbing Ben Linus?

32:42.837 --> 32:44.828
I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.755
And what are they gonna do
to the people with him?

32:47.842 --> 32:49.423
Nothing good.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.427
Hugo's with Ben.

32:55.391 --> 32:58.758
[exhales] Son of a bitch.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.855
[Jack] About ten months ago,

33:01.939 --> 33:05.306
I wrote what I wanted to say
at my father's funeral

33:05.401 --> 33:09.235
on the back of a cocktail napkin
at the Sydney airport.

33:11.073 --> 33:14.315
I don't remember what I wrote,
but whatever it was,

33:14.410 --> 33:16.366
he would've hated it.

33:16.453 --> 33:19.911
- [scattered laughter]
- My father couldn't stand eulogies.

33:20.541 --> 33:24.159
"The only good thing about a wake
is the free booze," he'd say.

33:27.131 --> 33:31.249
Not much of a wake because
I won't even be able to bury him.

33:33.470 --> 33:38.555
So, what I want to say
is not for my father.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.223
It's for me.

33:47.151 --> 33:48.812
Goodbye, Dad.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.152
I loved you.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.612
I miss you.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.331
Thanks very much for coming.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.454
Thank you for coming. Thanks.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.582
- I'll see you back at the house?
- Yeah.

34:10.591 --> 34:13.333
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you, Mom.

34:15.346 --> 34:17.302
I'm so glad you're home.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.845
- See you soon.
- OK.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.187
You did that well.

34:32.488 --> 34:33.694
I had a lot of practice.

34:35.491 --> 34:37.027
[woman clears throat]

34:38.035 --> 34:41.277
Excuse me. May I have a word with you?

34:43.666 --> 34:45.156
Mr. Shephard...

34:47.294 --> 34:49.330
...I'm very sorry for your loss.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.537
Thank you.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.840
How did you know my father?

34:56.553 --> 35:01.138
I believe I'm the reason
he was in Australia when he died.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.054
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.478
- Why would he have come to see you?
- Oh, he...

35:08.565 --> 35:11.602
He didn't come to see me.

35:11.694 --> 35:14.686
I was still in the hospital.
I never saw him.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.532
He came to see his daughter.

35:22.997 --> 35:26.364
My daughter, Mr. Shephard.

35:29.753 --> 35:34.087
- My father didn't have a daughter.
- Yes. He did.

35:35.175 --> 35:38.167
If you don't believe me,
check his phone records.

35:41.015 --> 35:46.100
Would you like to know the strangest
thing about all this, Mr. Shephard?

35:48.564 --> 35:51.431
My daughter was on your plane too.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.772
She was on flight 815.

35:59.283 --> 36:02.821
You were in the air for six hours.

36:02.911 --> 36:06.119
Probably just a few rows from her.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.913
And you never even knew
she was your sister.

36:11.920 --> 36:17.586
She was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.588
Her name was...

36:23.682 --> 36:24.842
...Claire.

36:31.982 --> 36:35.520
I didn't mean to burden you
with this, but...

36:35.611 --> 36:37.647
...you needed to know.

36:39.448 --> 36:43.942
I'm... sorry for your loss.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.794
Your son is beautiful.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.178
Thank you.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.232
I don't understand.
How did you get back to New York?

37:20.864 --> 37:25.528
Oh, Walt and I, uh...
we took Ben's boat

37:25.619 --> 37:29.157
and followed his bearing.
A couple of days we came to an island,

37:29.248 --> 37:31.910
you know, with people. I sold the boat,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.707
and we hopped a cargo ferry
back to the States.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.711
We didn't tell anybody who we were.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.464
And now you're working for Ben?

37:42.219 --> 37:45.131
I do not work for Ben.

37:47.349 --> 37:51.683
I'm trying to make up for what I did.
I'm trying to help you out here.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.605
- Translate what I said.
- I understand.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.775
Hey, Michael! I need you! Now!

38:09.163 --> 38:10.744
Oh, my God.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.118
[speaking in Korean]

38:19.298 --> 38:20.788
Now!

38:38.484 --> 38:39.894
What's the matter?

38:41.403 --> 38:45.237
[exhales]
These aren't Jack or Sawyer.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.861
They're different tracks, fresh.

38:48.869 --> 38:51.827
And they're doubling back behind us.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.700
Whoever you are, come out now!

39:03.050 --> 39:06.508
All right. All right, let's just relax.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.465
- All right, let's relax.
- Stop!

39:09.556 --> 39:10.966
- Stop!
- Put the guns down.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.640
- I said stop!
- Please, just drop your guns.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.012
Take one more step...

39:15.103 --> 39:17.890
[guns cocking]

39:30.160 --> 39:32.242
I said drop your guns.

39:42.297 --> 39:46.256
I see two of them,
but not the one who killed Alex.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.884
Hold onto that for me, will you?

39:52.975 --> 39:54.135
What?

39:54.226 --> 39:58.845
Listen to me very carefully, John.
I'm not gonna have time to repeat this.

39:58.939 --> 40:02.682
You're gonna go into that greenhouse
through that hole there.

40:02.776 --> 40:06.314
Once inside you're gonna turn left,
go about 20 paces until you see

40:06.405 --> 40:08.236
a patch of anthuriums on your left.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.406
They're in an alcove against
the north wall. Face that wall,

40:11.493 --> 40:15.657
reach down with your left hand, find
a switch that activates the elevator.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.368
The elevator takes you down
to the actual Orchid Station.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.836
- Whoa, wait, what?
- OK.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.377
Maybe I missed
the part where you explained

40:24.464 --> 40:27.592
what I'm supposed to do
about the armed men inside.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.007
I'm gonna take care of them.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.255
And how the hell are you gonna do that?

40:32.431 --> 40:35.047
How many times
do I have to tell you, John?

40:35.142 --> 40:36.507
I always have a plan.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.185
Ben.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.391
Ben!

41:43.919 --> 41:45.910
[gun cocking]

41:59.935 --> 42:02.768
My name is Benjamin Linus.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.106
I believe you're looking for me.
