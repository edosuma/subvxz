WEBVTT

01:26.586 --> 01:28.587
It seems like such
a short time ago

01:28.671 --> 01:32.841
that my pet and I were just lazing
about in our little London flat,

01:32.967 --> 01:34.635
living the humdrum bachelor life

01:34.677 --> 01:38.597
and wishing things weren't
so very, very dull.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.975
That's my pet, Roger.
My name's Pongo.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.619
You remember, I'm the
one with the spots.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.437
Oh, goodness!

01:45.522 --> 01:46.843
No, no, not that one.
Or that one.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.028
That's me, living my new
life as a family man.

01:53.154 --> 01:57.199
Never a dull moment. I
guess I got my wish.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.543
I think I'm seeing spots!

02:08.211 --> 02:11.003
Hey, seeing spots!

02:12.882 --> 02:16.135
Spots, I'm seeing spots
Everywhere I'm seeing lots.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.555
Of those tiny little
dots Yes, it's true.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.142
Theyore on the beds and the
cots In the pans and the pots.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.061
And they've left little
spots in the loo!

02:26.146 --> 02:29.231
Roger, are you
packing or playing?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.692
I'm playing at packing, dear!

02:31.734 --> 02:33.735
Well, quit fooling around.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.405
We're moving first
thing in the morning!

02:36.489 --> 02:39.575
We'll have a Dalmatian
plantation.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.705
I see spots on the walls In
the rooms, in the halls.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.666
On the floors in the
drawers Yes, I do.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.919
And every morning when I
rise and I open up my eyes

02:51.045 --> 02:54.256
I am taken by surprise 'Cause
instead of seeing skies

02:54.382 --> 02:57.426
I see lots of little spots.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.596
- We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
- Spots, spots, spots.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.016
- And never again shall we roam.
- Everywhere on the beds and the cots.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.392
- Can't wait to begin...
- On the walls...

03:05.435 --> 03:07.102
- ...our sweet living that's in.
- ...the rooms and the halls.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.689
- Our Dalmatian plantation home.
- Our Dalmatian plantation home.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.943
- Dalmatian plantation.
- Dalmatian plantation.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.446
- We're home.
- We're home.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.948
Oh, Roger!

03:20.074 --> 03:22.451
Yes, tomorrow would
be moving day.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.621
Only one more night
in this little flat,

03:25.705 --> 03:27.789
which was getting
smaller by the minute.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.460
I mean, even I was beginning
to feel a bit smothered.

03:31.544 --> 03:36.048
Really, it was easy to see how
one of our puppies could feel,

03:36.799 --> 03:41.136
well, just a little bit
lost in this sea of spots.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.473
- Ah, hello, Patch.
- Hello, Mother.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.475
Watching the
television, are we?

03:46.601 --> 03:50.312
Yes. Well, I've got to save
my spot, now, don't I?

03:50.396 --> 03:52.773
It's the best spot, after all!

03:54.484 --> 03:56.818
But you know your show
doesn't start until after...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.320
Dinnertime!

04:00.615 --> 04:03.450
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, not again!

04:16.755 --> 04:20.801
Come on, you guys! Make room!

04:23.846 --> 04:27.849
No, you don't, Mr Roly-Poly.
One bowl at a time!

04:56.546 --> 04:59.006
There must be something in here.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.178
Right! Is everybody
ready for the show?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.722
My spot!

05:06.848 --> 05:08.140
Thunderbolt.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.518
Hounding hoodlums with a howl
Bad no-goodniks hear his growl.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.520
Thunderbolt.

05:13.563 --> 05:17.357
Desperados, cringe in fear
Mighty Thunderbolt is here.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.670
Righting wrongs and doing right
Barking boldly in the night.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.237
The One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.740
Kanine Krunchies, the crunch
your dog loves to munch,

05:24.866 --> 05:27.534
presents The Thunderbolt
Adventure Hour.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.829
Starring Thunderbolt, the
One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog!

05:30.913 --> 05:33.081
And his trusty sidekick,
Lil' Lightning.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.169
In last week's thrilling episode,
Wholesome Tommy was kidnapped...

05:37.253 --> 05:39.338
Help! Thunderbolt! Save me!

05:40.590 --> 05:43.383
And spirited away by that
black-hearted villain, Dirty Dawson!

05:43.426 --> 05:45.594
Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!

05:45.720 --> 05:47.220
Will our hero arrive in time?

05:47.263 --> 05:49.514
Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!

05:50.436 --> 05:52.076
What horrible fate
awaits Wholesome Tommy?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.602
Oh, I can hardly look!

05:53.728 --> 05:56.104
I've seen this one.
This is brilliant!

05:56.230 --> 05:58.607
Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!

05:58.691 --> 06:02.194
That mangy mutt can't
save you this time!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.365
Hold on, Tommy!
Thunderbolt's coming!

06:28.137 --> 06:29.221
Hey!

06:29.305 --> 06:32.599
This is just like "Double-cross
at Dead Man's Ditch,"

06:32.642 --> 06:34.434
except that was a mine
car, not a train.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.573
Watch this, Thunder's
gonna grab the whip.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.244
Patch, you're gonna
spoil it again!

07:02.004 --> 07:06.466
They say every dog has his day, but
this one ain't gonna be yours,

07:06.509 --> 07:08.802
you flea-bitten cur!

07:28.865 --> 07:30.365
Yes! Yes!

07:40.334 --> 07:42.002
This ain't fair.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.392
What was that supposed to be?

08:01.898 --> 08:04.566
It was the most pitiful
bark I've heard yet.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.403
Yeah. It sounded like someone
sat on a squeaky toy!

08:20.666 --> 08:23.919
Thunderbolt, you're
one of a kind!

08:24.587 --> 08:27.422
Wow, one of a kind!

08:34.063 --> 08:35.823
Kanine Krunchies
can't be beat...

08:35.847 --> 08:37.557
All right, bedtime, everyone.

08:39.602 --> 08:44.105
But, Dad, we're
not sleepy yet.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.442
Nanny, do you have
the new dog tags?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.947
Right here. We'll put them on
as they come up the stairs.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.700
Say, kiddies! Is your dog a
One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.619
If you think your pooch
has what it takes,

08:57.703 --> 09:00.956
bring him down to the London set of
Thunderbolt's exciting new adventure,

09:01.082 --> 09:03.959
"Thunderbolt versus the
Hound of the Baskervilles."

09:04.043 --> 09:08.046
- Thunderbolt's in London? - That's
right! Thunderbolt's in London.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.383
Just follow the Kanine Krunchies
truck down to tomorrow's auditions,

09:11.467 --> 09:13.969
where one lucky pup will
win the opportunity

09:14.053 --> 09:15.804
to appear as a
guest on the show!

09:15.888 --> 09:17.764
Dad, Dad, Dad!

09:17.807 --> 09:19.641
57, 58... Careful.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.145
59, 60, 61, 62, 63...

09:24.230 --> 09:26.815
Dad! Dad! I have to
see Thunderbolt!

09:26.941 --> 09:28.817
Just a minute, Son. I'm
counting...67, 68...

09:28.901 --> 09:32.153
But, Dad, I've seen
every episode, all 72.

09:32.238 --> 09:37.993
72, 73... Two? Not now, Patch.
I'm busy losing count here!

09:38.119 --> 09:42.956
- ...76, 77, 78, 79...
- But, Dad! Dad!

09:43.749 --> 09:45.166
82, 83...

09:47.253 --> 09:50.839
Oh, dear...98, 99, 100,
101, 102, 103, 104,

09:50.965 --> 09:54.676
and Patch, 105. 105?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.845
Are you all right, Son?

09:56.929 --> 10:00.265
Dad, I've just gotta see
Thunderbolt tomorrow.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.435
Yes, I know, but
tomorrow is moving day.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.854
You're going to love
it on the farm, Son.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.481
There are big green fields
and a stream and a barn

10:08.524 --> 10:10.525
and lots of different animals.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.695
Hey, maybe you and I can
chase some chickens, huh?

10:13.821 --> 10:17.657
- Sure, Dad, but...
- Here we go!

10:18.034 --> 10:21.202
"Cherry Tree Farm, Little
Tichfield, Devon."

10:21.787 --> 10:25.832
Why, I imagine it's the most
splendid farm in the whole country.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.713
Oh, Perdi, the farm will be such a
wonderful place to raise our puppies.

10:31.797 --> 10:36.217
And best of all, we'll be Miles away
from that evil, ugly monster...

10:36.552 --> 10:39.888
Cruella De Vil! Now,
please let me in!

10:41.557 --> 10:44.059
I can't do that, Miss de Vil.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.228
But, Mr Fitzweil, please,
something, anything.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.982
You know very well that the
terms of your probation

10:51.067 --> 10:53.568
don't allow me to sell
you any more furs.

10:53.694 --> 10:58.406
Not even a stole, a muff,
a pair of mittens?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.658
No!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.242
- One mitten?
- No!

11:14.590 --> 11:18.551
Could things possibly
be any worse?

11:18.594 --> 11:21.763
Cruella De Vil, Cruella De Vil.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.432
Shut up, shut up! Stop it!

12:00.553 --> 12:04.806
What does Cruella De Vil
have left to live for?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.277
Good grief.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.004
Tell me, what do you see?

12:36.088 --> 12:40.467
Everything. Darkness and
light, form and content.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.552
And what else?

12:42.678 --> 12:46.139
Chaos and order, Joy and pain.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.141
And there is more than that?

12:48.225 --> 12:52.103
The possibility of triumph,
the certainty of defeat,

12:52.188 --> 12:57.859
the culmination of all I've ever
reached for but could not grasp!

12:59.236 --> 13:01.321
I see everything!

13:01.405 --> 13:04.115
I see absolutely everything!

13:05.534 --> 13:09.788
I feel faint in the presence
of such artistic truth.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.707
Where is the artist? I
simply must meet him!

13:12.792 --> 13:15.001
But you already have.

13:16.003 --> 13:21.633
I am Lars and I am an
undiscovered genius.

13:21.717 --> 13:25.595
My name is Cruella De Vil, and
I'm an over-financed heiress.

13:25.679 --> 13:30.266
Your passion for my work
both repels and attracts.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.562
Could you bear the sweet
agony of seeing more?

13:34.730 --> 13:37.398
You mean there's more?

13:40.361 --> 13:45.448
Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots!

13:45.533 --> 13:48.034
I had yet to find anyone
who truly understood

13:48.118 --> 13:50.829
their bleak, but
beautiful meaning.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.250
That is, until I met you.

13:55.334 --> 13:59.170
This could be it! This could
be the cure for my craving!

13:59.255 --> 14:00.588
My analyst said I should find

14:00.673 --> 14:04.425
something to substitute for
my magnificent obsession.

14:05.761 --> 14:10.932
Who needs furs when I can soothe
my tortured soul with art?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.517
Something tortures you?

14:12.601 --> 14:18.273
Tell me, what cloud dares
cast a shadow on the flower?

14:18.774 --> 14:22.277
Oh, it's a sad but familiar tale
of loss and disappointment,

14:22.361 --> 14:24.946
probation and a
restraining order.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.408
But you, you can help
Cruella to forget all that.

14:28.492 --> 14:33.246
Will you do a painting just
for me, to ease my pain?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.333
I will create a masterpiece,

14:37.418 --> 14:41.462
if you will be my muse.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.632
Oh, darling.

15:47.988 --> 15:52.492
63, 22...

15:53.410 --> 15:56.079
202. No, no, no. Oh, no.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.165
- Dad?
- 97...

15:59.249 --> 16:01.042
- I can't sleep.
- 98...

16:01.126 --> 16:03.878
- I've been thinking.
- 99...

16:05.839 --> 16:11.511
Do you think I'm a one of
a kind or just one ofl01?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.847
101! That's it.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.226
101.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.898
All right, everyone,
into the truck!

17:08.484 --> 17:10.694
You're 90. You're 91. You're 92.
You're 93.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.406
You're 94. Hold it.
Wait. You're 98.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.159
You're 99. You're
100 and you're 101.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.411
And you're 101. And you're 101.

17:18.494 --> 17:19.579
Hold it. Wait.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.705
How many 101s are there?

17:23.083 --> 17:27.878
Well, I've successfully lost count
again. Right. Anyone not here, speak up.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.092
Oh, no!

17:34.678 --> 17:36.929
Wait! Wait for me!

17:39.099 --> 17:43.394
Well, that figures. They
didn't even miss me.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.071
Then I'm not going to miss them.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.641
Well, what do you think?

18:22.893 --> 18:24.644
Why, it's splendid!

18:26.522 --> 18:29.482
Puppies, welcome
to your new home!

18:30.359 --> 18:35.196
Right then. That's 1 and 2
and 27, 36, 5, 50, 80...

18:35.280 --> 18:39.659
Minus two, carry the
three and... 101?

18:39.743 --> 18:42.995
Finally, no more counting.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.051
Run!

19:03.934 --> 19:07.645
All this place needs is a proper
dusting, a splash of paint,

19:07.729 --> 19:09.856
and it'll be good as new.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.735
Now, where do you suppose
we'll put the music room?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.701
I think you just
found it, darling.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.327
Thunderbolt.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.956
Hounding hoodlums with a howl
Bad no-goodniks hear his growl.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.416
Thunderbolt.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.419
Desperados, cringe in fear
Mighty Thunderbolt is here.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.881
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

19:34.965 --> 19:38.217
pooches and pups of all
ages, are you ready?

19:39.469 --> 19:44.807
Desperados cringe in fear,
Mighty Thunderbolt is here!

19:50.230 --> 19:53.733
I don't believe it!
It's really him!

19:53.817 --> 19:59.989
And here's his sidekick extraordinaire,
the ever-trusty Lil' Lightning!

20:05.579 --> 20:08.331
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hello, handsome!

20:08.415 --> 20:11.250
Over here, you gorgeous
hunk of hound.

20:11.335 --> 20:15.087
Oh, hi, ladies.
Nice to meet you.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.924
- Oh, no.
- We don't want you.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.550
Get out of the way.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.428
- We want...
- Thunderbolt!

20:24.848 --> 20:28.601
Sorry, little buddy, but these ladies
aren't interested in the sidekick.

20:28.685 --> 20:32.855
They're here to get a
big eyeful of hero!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.484
Heel, ladies, heel!

20:38.570 --> 20:41.572
All right, everybody, line up
your dogs for the audition.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.450
We need to hear their
best heroic bark!

21:01.426 --> 21:02.635
Very good.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.349
Hey, that's very...
Oh, there's more!

21:17.859 --> 21:20.611
Well, go ahead.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.655
Uh...

21:24.366 --> 21:27.076
What's the matter, little fella?
Cat got your tongue?

21:29.788 --> 21:33.541
It's funny, 'cause, you see, we're
dogs and we chase cats, so...

21:35.877 --> 21:37.753
Well, it made me laugh.

21:37.838 --> 21:41.841
Come on, kid, we haven't got all year.
You're wasting my valuable limelight.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.391
Say, who sat on the squeaky toy?

21:52.853 --> 21:55.813
- Hey, Thunderbolt, over here!
- Nice.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.277
Thunderbolt.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.238
That's it, folks! We'll announce the
winner of the audition tomorrow.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.866
Have a megafantabulous day,

22:06.950 --> 22:12.121
and remember, buy your pooch lots
and lots of tasty Kanine Krunchies!

22:22.382 --> 22:25.426
Nice work, Patch.
Just brilliant.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.352
Ladies, ladies, you're
wearing me out!

22:35.020 --> 22:38.064
Oh, please, just do
it one more time.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.777
Oh, well, all right. I guess just
one more time couldn't hurt.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.659
Golly, I'm good. Hello, boys!

23:02.631 --> 23:04.071
- Thunder! - Lightning,
little buddy.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.717
It's just awful!

23:06.802 --> 23:10.388
I overheard what they're
planning for the next episode!

23:15.602 --> 23:17.895
Don't be too harsh on
them, little buddy.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.647
I know we don't have the
best writers in television,

23:19.731 --> 23:21.690
but we can always improvise.

23:21.775 --> 23:26.278
I'm pretty good at improvising, as
long as it's written down for me.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.572
No, no, you don't understand.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.492
Something really horrible
is going to happen.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.868
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

23:32.953 --> 23:33.994
- The dam breaks?
- No.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.204
- The mine collapses?
- No.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.498
Do I get an evil twin? I've
always wanted an evil twin!

23:37.582 --> 23:41.502
No! Listen, Thunder,
what happens is you...

23:41.586 --> 23:44.171
You... You die.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.967
I don't believe it.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.511
I die?

23:50.595 --> 23:54.765
Oh, Lightning, this is just
about the greatest thing ever!

23:55.976 --> 23:58.477
I've always wanted to
play a big death scene!

23:58.562 --> 24:02.690
The selfless hero who sacrifices
himself to save the innocent.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.237
I'll kick bigger
than Old Yeller!

24:08.321 --> 24:12.741
So, how do I make my shockingly
unexpected and triumphant return?

24:12.826 --> 24:15.369
- You don't. - What
do you mean, I don't?

24:15.454 --> 24:18.831
You don't make a shockingly
unexpected and triumphant return.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.584
You die. You're dead.

24:21.668 --> 24:25.379
- You never come back. - Not
even for a reunion show?

24:25.464 --> 24:28.174
Not even for a cameo
in the remake.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.052
They're writing me
out of the show?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.555
They're gonna replace
you with a younger dog.

24:34.639 --> 24:39.393
So that's what those auditions
were really all about!

24:39.478 --> 24:41.729
Lightning, you've gotta help me!

24:41.813 --> 24:46.567
I can't end up on the street,
homeless, foraging in trash cans.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.570
Mange! I could get mange!

24:49.654 --> 24:53.240
Well, I... I did have
this one crazy thought.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.410
Or ticks! I hate ticks!

24:56.495 --> 24:59.914
They suck all the blood out
of you. Do you hear me?

24:59.998 --> 25:04.418
They suck all the
blood out of you.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.257
What if you went out and
did something heroic,

25:10.342 --> 25:12.593
like you do on the show,
but in the real world?

25:12.677 --> 25:17.097
You know, get your name in the paper.
Prove to them that you still got it!

25:17.182 --> 25:18.516
Wait a minute.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.020
What if I went out and did something
heroic in the real world?

25:23.104 --> 25:25.606
Or that could work, too.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.108
Аfter all, you are the
One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.445
- How hard could it be?
- Yeah, it'll be a catwalk.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.073
- Cakewalk.
- Precisely!

25:34.157 --> 25:37.493
I'll just go get a little press
for doing some easy hero stuff

25:37.577 --> 25:40.412
and they'll be begging
to keep me on the show!

25:40.497 --> 25:45.209
But, first, I'll have to figure out a
way to sneak past my adoring public.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.805
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

25:57.889 --> 25:58.973
Hide.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.309
Master of disguise.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.811
Hi, Thunderbolt!

26:03.895 --> 26:07.314
I'm sorry, I'm... You've
got the wrong dog, kid.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.233
I know it's you.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.319
That's the same disguise
you used in episode 18,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.989
"Gambling Gophers
of Gunfire Gulch."

26:15.073 --> 26:18.826
For howling out loud! Now
you've blown my cover.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.246
This is champion! I'm your
biggest fan, Thunderbolt!

26:22.330 --> 26:25.416
I know every episode by heart!

26:25.500 --> 26:27.876
Remember the time when you
fought that grizzly bear

26:27.961 --> 26:30.337
and rescued those orphans
and then the dam broke?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.507
- And... And... - Hey,
aren't you the squeaky toy?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.926
Yeah. That's me.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.303
- Listen, pup...
- Patch.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.763
Pooch, whatever. You've
gotta understand.

26:39.848 --> 26:43.559
Sometimes danger and I
like to dance alone!

26:46.104 --> 26:47.479
Good gracious gravy,
look at that!

26:47.564 --> 26:50.691
- A cat is stuck up in that tree!
- He is?

26:50.775 --> 26:54.570
Oh, my heart goes out to the
poor helpless creature.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.698
Now, if I were me,
what would I do?

26:57.782 --> 26:59.950
Well, I'd read the script,
that's what I'd do.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.203
Oh, no, I don't have a script!

27:04.254 --> 27:06.975
This is just like when Tommy was
trapped on that Cliff in episode 29.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.667
- Okay, okay, don't panic.
- That one was a classic.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.879
- You can do this. You can do this.
- Only it's also like episode 64.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.443
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.257
When he was drowning
in the water tower.

27:15.263 --> 27:16.943
- Yeah, that was great.
- Who am I kidding?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.677
I have no idea what I'm doing!

27:18.762 --> 27:22.348
But episode 29 was still the best,
at least from the first season.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.474
- Pooch!
- Patch.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.769
- Whatever! I'm trying to panic here!
- Sorry.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.189
I just thought you were going to
do what you did on Raccoon Ridge.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.899
You know, when you
got that barrel?

27:31.983 --> 27:35.235
And rolled it next to the Cliff?
Then you found a long plank of wood?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.488
And got a great big
round Boulder,

27:37.572 --> 27:39.406
- and then...
- Precisely!

27:42.744 --> 27:43.994
Whoa!

27:48.750 --> 27:52.419
Hang on, little kitty!
Help is on the way!

27:53.838 --> 27:55.881
The press is going to love this.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.777
There you are, my good man.
No need to thank me.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.446
The look on your face
is thanks enough!

28:19.531 --> 28:22.116
Now, smile for the cameras!

28:23.618 --> 28:26.578
Hey, that's strange. Where
are all the photographers?

28:26.663 --> 28:29.164
The press is always around
when I do something.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.208
What's the matter with
you English people?

28:31.292 --> 28:32.960
Are you all having tea?

28:33.044 --> 28:36.797
How am I supposed to get my job
back if you're all having tea?

28:36.881 --> 28:40.092
That was champion, Thunder!
Just like on the telly!

28:40.176 --> 28:42.553
You know, this stuff isn't
as easy as it looks!

28:42.637 --> 28:44.263
I mean, maybe if I could
remember what happened

28:44.347 --> 28:46.932
in every episode of the show, you
know, like Squeaky Toy, here,

28:47.016 --> 28:48.642
well, then I could...

28:49.352 --> 28:52.730
Hey, Squeaky Toy.

28:58.778 --> 29:02.906
Oh, darling, it's just divine!

29:02.991 --> 29:06.160
It's remarkable. It's stunning.
It's grand!

29:06.244 --> 29:07.828
But it's all wrong.

29:07.912 --> 29:12.833
But it's my best
work yet, cupcake.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.044
But it simply has to be better
than your best, darling.

29:16.129 --> 29:20.716
I mean, look at these spots. The
shapes aren't at all acceptable.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.676
They're not soft enough.

29:23.887 --> 29:29.475
You know, cuddly, like something you'd
want to squeeze the life out of!

29:29.559 --> 29:31.435
No, this one is no good at all,

29:31.519 --> 29:35.230
an embarrassing mediocrity,
a complete failure.

29:35.315 --> 29:39.860
Your harsh words strike me like blows
from the fists of a large dockworker.

29:39.944 --> 29:44.198
I would cry now were
it not so bourgeois.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.826
There, there. I know you'll get
it right, my depressive Da Vinci.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.620
You simply have to keep trying.

29:49.704 --> 29:54.208
Аfter all, you're the only one
who truly understands Cruella,

29:54.292 --> 29:58.045
who can see into
her tortured soul.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.379
Yes!

29:59.464 --> 30:04.927
Her heart is like a vast, dark ocean
on whose waves I am hopelessly adrift

30:05.011 --> 30:07.930
in my dinghy of passion.

30:10.266 --> 30:14.978
I shall not betray your faith in
me! I shall create another canvas!

30:15.063 --> 30:17.481
And another! And another!
And another!

30:17.565 --> 30:21.360
Until I have found
spotted perfection!

30:21.444 --> 30:28.116
I shall not stop until the fires of
your craving have been quenched.

30:29.953 --> 30:34.039
Junior deputy test? Which
episode was that in?

30:34.123 --> 30:35.415
One of the lost episodes.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.753
But I only give it to pups
who I think might be worthy.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.089
And, who knows, if
you do real good,

30:42.173 --> 30:45.259
maybe I'll even let you
be on the show with me!

30:46.261 --> 30:50.055
- Really? - Sure, kid.
- I'm the star, aren't I?

30:51.432 --> 30:55.185
Mother of pasteurized milk! That
stagecoach is out of control!

30:55.270 --> 30:58.105
This is your first
Junior deputy test, kid.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.524
Okay, well...

31:00.608 --> 31:05.279
This is just like in episode 37,
"Stagecoaches of Serpent Summit."

31:05.363 --> 31:11.118
Very good. Now, episode 37, was that
the one where I leap, run and pounce?

31:11.202 --> 31:13.871
No, no. That was the one where
you run, pounce and leap!

31:13.955 --> 31:16.456
Precisely! Stand back!

31:25.717 --> 31:29.136
Get a hold of yourself, man.
You're out of control!

31:30.346 --> 31:31.388
Whoa!

31:31.472 --> 31:33.724
It's okay! I'll get the brake!

31:46.321 --> 31:49.615
Still no photographers. How odd.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.160
There may be days when
things don't go right.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.829
And your shoes reouse to dance.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.457
To make the winds of
fortune blow right

31:58.499 --> 32:01.001
oou might need a second chance.

32:01.085 --> 32:06.340
So if you get one try and that
don't fly Stop and count to 10.

32:06.466 --> 32:11.970
And if at first you don't
succeed Try again.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.597
Here's your next test, kid.

32:13.681 --> 32:18.477
Wow, bank robbers! Episode four.

32:21.105 --> 32:25.108
Beginner's luck is overrated Once
you blink it's come and gone.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.443
The only way to cultivate it.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.530
Is to keep on keeping on.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.199
Yeah.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.825
Still no photographers?

32:33.868 --> 32:36.161
Try and try and then.

32:36.204 --> 32:41.208
If at first you don't
succeed, yeah Try again.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.377
- Try, try again.
- Yes, my friend.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.128
Try, try, try again.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.382
- Those men are frozen with fear.
- No wonder.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.885
Those crazed badgers are
trying to eat their heads!

32:51.970 --> 32:56.640
It's just like in episode 27, when
you whipped those two grizzlies.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.725
Huh?

33:04.691 --> 33:07.234
And don't you never stop, no.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.075
- What is it? - Looks
like we've stumbled

33:15.159 --> 33:17.744
on a band of cattle rustlers.

33:17.870 --> 33:21.415
- Aren't those monkeys? - Even
worse, monkey rustlers!

33:21.541 --> 33:23.583
Sounds like episode 34 to me.

33:23.710 --> 33:27.671
Right answer, once
again, Junior Deputy.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.381
I passed the test?

33:29.424 --> 33:31.758
- Think you can handle it?
- You bet!

33:31.843 --> 33:33.927
Let's get those monkey rustlers!

33:34.012 --> 33:37.931
Now if you find you're batting
zero And a legend you are not.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.438
You can still wind up a hero
if you give it one more shot.

33:44.522 --> 33:49.860
If you don't give in, you're gonna
win The only question's when.

33:49.944 --> 33:53.530
So if at first you
don't succeed.

33:53.614 --> 33:57.284
- Try again. - Try,
try, try again.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.954
- Try, try again.
- And again.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.249
- Try again. - Try,
try, try again.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.918
Try again.

34:06.961 --> 34:10.547
Hey! Get over on the right
side of the road, buddy.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.924
Sheesh, London drivers.

34:14.135 --> 34:19.139
I tell you, Thunder, this
is the best day ever.

34:19.264 --> 34:22.059
Yeah. You know, I never knew it
would be so much fun out here

34:22.143 --> 34:23.810
doing this real hero stuff.

34:23.936 --> 34:26.646
What do you mean? Don't
you do this all the time?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.650
Oh, well, kid...

34:33.737 --> 34:35.655
Well, you know, it's...

34:35.782 --> 34:39.784
Of course, I do! I do
this all the time!

34:42.621 --> 34:44.998
- So let's talk about you, kid!
- Me?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.833
Yeah, what's your story?

34:46.918 --> 34:50.170
- Well... - Hold on.
- Okay. Go on.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.172
Missing! What do you
mean, he's missing?

34:53.257 --> 34:54.674
- We've looked.
- And looked.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.177
But there's just no sign
of Thunderbolt anywhere!

34:57.261 --> 35:01.306
This is a catastrophe! A
calamity! A cataclysm!

35:01.349 --> 35:03.029
We have to shoot first
thing in the morning

35:03.101 --> 35:05.602
and I find out my
star is missing.

35:05.686 --> 35:11.691
How can you shoot a
show without a star?

35:11.776 --> 35:13.693
How do you spell "cataclysm"?

35:13.778 --> 35:16.363
How can you shoot a
show without a star?

35:16.447 --> 35:19.157
How can you shoot a
show without a...

35:22.036 --> 35:26.039
A star? This is it! This
is megafantabulous!

35:26.165 --> 35:28.208
We'll rewrite this episode
to star Lil' Lightning!

35:28.292 --> 35:31.795
Oh, I'm a genius! Get the
writers! Fire the director!

35:31.879 --> 35:34.714
This is going to be a whole new
direction for The Thunderbolt...

35:36.884 --> 35:39.553
"А whole new direction!"

35:39.637 --> 35:44.558
What do you think of that,
Thunderbolt, old pal?

35:44.642 --> 35:47.644
Finally, I'll be able to
step out of your shadow,

35:47.728 --> 35:50.647
you overrated, overacting ham!

35:50.731 --> 35:53.525
The Lil' Lightning
Adventure Hour.

35:53.568 --> 35:57.154
It has a nice ring, doesn't it?
What do you think?

35:59.866 --> 36:02.409
I have failed you, my muse!

36:04.078 --> 36:07.247
Oh, fickle bird of inspiration,

36:07.373 --> 36:10.417
to what far shore
have you flown?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.714
Poor pathetic Lars,
do not despair.

36:15.756 --> 36:20.010
I know exactly where to find
the inspiration we crave.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.888
Well, this is art, after all.
Art!

36:22.930 --> 36:27.225
Our creativity cannot be thwarted by
trivial matters like restraining orders.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.896
Yes, sacrifices must be made!

36:32.023 --> 36:34.774
Gone? They're all gone?

36:34.859 --> 36:37.777
How unspeakably rude
of Anita to move away

36:37.904 --> 36:41.114
without even leaving a
forwarding address!

36:41.199 --> 36:44.117
Lars, now what am I to do?

36:45.953 --> 36:48.455
Why, you little... What's this?

36:49.582 --> 36:54.794
I know you. Oh,
this is delicious.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.214
"Cherry Tree Farm, Little
Tichfield, Devon."

37:09.435 --> 37:10.727
Oh, no.

37:12.813 --> 37:15.482
Freckles, dear. Stop helping.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.280
Oh, my, the tea!

37:26.661 --> 37:28.787
Yes, the paper!

37:28.829 --> 37:32.666
No time to read this if I'm
going to finish my new song.

37:37.171 --> 37:40.840
Well, I come from this
really big family.

37:40.925 --> 37:46.012
I knew a guy came from a big
litter, 10 or 12, I forget.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.641
- There's 101 of us.
- 101 Dalmatians?

37:49.684 --> 37:53.853
Hey, I heard about you guys. Yeah,
you were on the Twilight Bark.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.814
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

37:55.856 --> 37:59.484
I'm afraid all I'll
ever be is one ofl01.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.655
Аt least that's
what my dad thinks.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.992
Hey, Thunderbolt?

38:07.034 --> 38:10.203
How do you become a One-of-a-Kind
Wonder Dog, anyway?

38:10.329 --> 38:15.667
Well, in my case, it all hinged
on getting just the right agent.

38:15.710 --> 38:20.130
But, you know, kid, getting there
isn't so tough, it's staying on top.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.881
That's the real challenge.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.385
You think you're doing
great and all of a sudden,

38:25.511 --> 38:27.220
there's somebody trying
to take your place.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.388
Crowd you out!

38:28.472 --> 38:31.057
- Push you aside!
- Steal your spot!

38:31.183 --> 38:34.811
- Precisely!
- Precisely!

38:35.896 --> 38:37.897
You know, you're all right, kid.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.068
I'll tell you what,
little buddy.

38:42.194 --> 38:45.739
I'm planning on doing some
more big hero stuff today.

38:45.823 --> 38:49.409
You stick with me, maybe you'll
get your picture in the paper,

38:49.535 --> 38:52.662
show the world that you're
not just another dog.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.916
Oh, no, no, no. Like this.

39:16.771 --> 39:17.771
Uh-oh.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.284
What? Patch in London?

39:32.078 --> 39:34.913
Don't you worry. I'll keep
an eye on things here.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.291
This is all my fault. If
only I hadn't lost count.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.293
Stop blaming yourself, dear.

39:40.419 --> 39:44.464
The important thing now is that we
find him before Cruella De Vil does!

39:48.469 --> 39:53.473
It's not fair, Horace, me lad.
It's just not fair.

39:53.599 --> 39:56.976
How come she gets off with probation
and a restraining order...

39:57.103 --> 39:59.979
While we's left
rotting away in here?

40:00.064 --> 40:03.233
Off your bums, lads. Sprung
for your bail, somebody has.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.485
It must be Mum
come to spring us!

40:05.569 --> 40:08.488
Mum never liked me.
Must be good old Dad!

40:08.614 --> 40:10.824
Dad never liked you, either.

40:12.326 --> 40:16.830
Jasper, Horace. It's
time to finish the job.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.498
Oh, no, not her.

40:18.624 --> 40:21.126
We always get the worst
end of it with her.

40:21.168 --> 40:27.006
Well, if she wants us to work for her
this time, we won't be made fools of.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.969
You look just like Mum.

40:31.011 --> 40:35.682
Shut up, you! I ain't going through
with this, I tell you. I ain't!

40:35.808 --> 40:37.767
Here he comes now!

40:40.980 --> 40:43.106
- Go on, Jasper. Go on.
- Go! Go on, go!

40:49.488 --> 40:53.032
Аfternoon, love!
Something I can...

40:54.702 --> 40:56.369
Hello, there.

40:56.454 --> 41:02.041
Something I can do for a pretty
young lady like yourself?

41:02.168 --> 41:05.545
Of course you can,
you naughty man.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.883
You can just give me this truck!

41:25.566 --> 41:29.235
They're all inside, Jasper!
Go ahead and start it up!

41:34.742 --> 41:36.075
Whatever in the world?

41:36.702 --> 41:37.744
Hmm?

41:43.209 --> 41:44.751
Hey, where's he going?

41:46.003 --> 41:48.087
- Kanine Krunchies!
- Kanine Krunchies!

41:48.214 --> 41:51.090
What's that? PUPPY
Hey, Kanine Krunchies!

42:10.444 --> 42:12.195
It worked, Jasper.

42:13.030 --> 42:17.367
Like a dream, Horace,
me lad, like a dream!

42:17.451 --> 42:21.287
You! I should have known
it was you terrible men!

42:21.372 --> 42:23.748
Now let those puppies
go right now

42:23.791 --> 42:26.626
or I'm going to knock the
stupid out of both of you!

42:26.752 --> 42:30.588
Here now, lady, we don't want
to have to hurt you none, so...

42:34.635 --> 42:35.969
Calm down.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.639
She's... She's mad, I say.
Come on!

42:57.825 --> 43:02.412
Right. That's it, then. I've
had just about enough of this!

43:02.746 --> 43:04.998
Oh, no!

43:05.499 --> 43:08.918
There now. That ought to
hold you right proper.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.503
- Jasper?
- What?

43:10.629 --> 43:13.131
Can we just go
back to jail, now?

43:15.009 --> 43:17.260
Your muse has returned!

43:18.762 --> 43:23.182
But I am a failure. You
should despise me.

43:26.312 --> 43:30.481
Stop being such a wet blanket and
come see what I've brought for you!

43:30.524 --> 43:32.525
A gift? For me?

43:33.527 --> 43:36.279
How very Christmas morning with
the twinkle lights of you.

43:36.363 --> 43:39.032
The gift of inspiration!

43:44.705 --> 43:51.210
Well, of course, these are only just
about the most adorable little puppies

43:51.253 --> 43:53.588
I've ever seen in my whole life!

43:53.714 --> 43:55.715
Look at these cute
little darlings!

43:55.841 --> 44:00.053
Fuzzy wuzzy little puppy poo.
Poo poo, little puppy poo.

44:00.095 --> 44:05.058
Did you see that? Did you see
that? He gave me a little kissy!

44:05.184 --> 44:06.601
I'm going to kiss him back now.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.895
He's having a wobbly.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.898
And you mean for me to do a
painting of them, don't you?

44:11.940 --> 44:15.902
That's an absolutely lovely
idea! It makes me smile a lot.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.405
"Painting of them," he says.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.744
No, no, no, darling. I don't want
you to make art of the puppies.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.913
I want you to make art
with the puppies.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.790
Use their coats as canvases.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.875
Create a masterpiece
in a new medium.

44:30.918 --> 44:37.090
Together, you and I will stun the art
world with our ruthless originality!

44:37.132 --> 44:38.257
But that means...

44:39.426 --> 44:42.887
How could you do such a thing
to the cute little puppies?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.263
- Poison them.
- Drown them.

44:44.306 --> 44:45.390
Bash them in the head!

44:45.432 --> 44:49.143
I may be eccentric,
but I am not a sicko!

44:49.269 --> 44:50.937
- What? - And you'll
not hurt one spot

44:50.983 --> 44:52.623
on these innocent little
creatures' heads,

44:52.648 --> 44:55.775
not as long as I have
anything to say about it!

44:57.653 --> 45:01.114
I thought you were a man of vision,
someone who understood my passions,

45:01.156 --> 45:04.450
who understood the
complexity that is Cruella!

45:04.576 --> 45:06.786
Does no one get the point?

45:09.456 --> 45:12.291
Lars, you're such
a disappointment.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.293
Well, if I can't
have a masterpiece,

45:14.420 --> 45:17.171
at least I'll finally have
a fabulous Dalmatian coat.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.591
That's almost as good,
don't you agree?

45:45.492 --> 45:47.827
What's gotten into you, girl?

46:18.734 --> 46:20.860
Kidnapped? How many?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.425
Uh-huh...

46:44.551 --> 46:46.844
Wretched dogs.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.597
Oh!

46:52.226 --> 46:53.392
Steady, lads!

47:04.238 --> 47:05.863
I just can't understand it.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.907
We've been out here doing
hero stuff all day

47:08.033 --> 47:12.245
and none of these London
photographers seem to care.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.580
Why do you want
photographers around?

47:14.706 --> 47:17.083
Kid. Look, I got
something to tell you.

47:18.252 --> 47:22.755
Something I guess I should've
told you a long time ago.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.799
I don't know how to say
this, but the truth is...

47:24.925 --> 47:29.470
Thunderbolt, listen!
There's an emergency!

47:30.472 --> 47:33.099
Sounds like a kidnapping!

47:33.225 --> 47:38.312
Being held in a warehouse, a
devil woman, 101 Dalmatians.

47:38.438 --> 47:43.276
Hey, what a coincidence! You
come from a family ofl01, too!

47:43.402 --> 47:44.569
Wait, what's the matter, kid?

47:44.611 --> 47:48.239
That is my family. Cruella
must have them again!

47:48.282 --> 47:50.324
- Cruella?
- The devil woman!

47:50.450 --> 47:53.119
She's the one who
kidnapped us before.

47:53.245 --> 47:57.456
This is awful. What
am I going to do?

47:58.834 --> 48:04.130
Wait a second. Thunderbolt!
You'll help us, won't you?

48:04.256 --> 48:09.135
Yes. Well, kid, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

48:09.261 --> 48:11.596
You see, I'm not really a...

48:17.311 --> 48:20.104
Of course, I'll help you, Patch.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.774
Yeah, the world-famous
Thunderbolt

48:23.817 --> 48:26.485
rescues the world-famous
101 Dalmatians.

48:28.655 --> 48:33.784
Sounds like a good story to me!
Newsworthy, even.

48:33.827 --> 48:37.330
Come on. We'll let them
know I'm on my way.

48:37.372 --> 48:43.169
The villains will soon cringe in
fear! Mighty Thunderbolt is here!

48:53.639 --> 48:57.558
It's just wonderful! I heard
it through the Twilight Bark!

48:57.684 --> 48:59.352
- Tell all!
- Well,

48:59.394 --> 49:02.146
Thunderbolt is going to save
those little Dalmatian puppies!

49:03.649 --> 49:05.490
- The ones that were kidnapped?
- That's right!

49:05.525 --> 49:07.860
Isn't he just a dream?

49:07.986 --> 49:09.487
More like a nightmare!

49:09.529 --> 49:12.740
What if Blunderbolt gets
lucky and succeeds?

49:12.866 --> 49:17.161
If the press got wind of that,
I'd never be rid of him!

49:22.376 --> 49:26.253
- Look, that must be the warehouse.
- Let's try over there.

49:27.214 --> 49:30.216
- Hey, do you think you can reach that?
- No problem.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.510
Thunderbolt, old pal.

49:32.552 --> 49:35.054
- Lightning? - Lightning!
- What are you doing here?

49:35.180 --> 49:38.057
I came as soon as I heard. Thought
you might need a bit of help.

49:38.183 --> 49:41.894
- Thanks for coming, little buddy.
- Wouldn't miss it.

49:55.075 --> 49:57.076
What's that supposed to be?

49:57.202 --> 50:00.579
Leave us alone, Jasper. I
think it's kind of pretty.

50:00.622 --> 50:03.791
- So, what's the plan, kid?
- See those guards?

50:03.917 --> 50:06.252
I think you can sneak past them.

50:06.378 --> 50:10.548
Remember the end of episode 39,
"Flight from the Forbidden Fort"?

50:10.590 --> 50:12.425
The one where I ran,
jumped and sprang?

50:12.467 --> 50:15.636
No, no. Sneaked,
evaded and triumphed.

50:15.762 --> 50:19.598
Oh, yeah, of course. I get it.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.768
Hey, you're a pretty smart kid.

50:22.811 --> 50:27.273
That's a good plan, stealthy.
But we don't need any of that!

50:27.315 --> 50:28.983
This is Thunderbolt!

50:29.109 --> 50:33.320
Villains always cringe in fear
whenever Thunderbolt is here!

50:33.447 --> 50:35.114
So true.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.951
What we need is a full frontal
assault! How hard can it be?

50:39.077 --> 50:41.787
That's right! How hard
can it be? Follow me!

50:41.830 --> 50:44.165
I'm right behind you, pal.

50:44.958 --> 50:48.669
Sort of looks like you, except
you don't have that much hair.

50:51.631 --> 50:54.341
It's Patch. And he's
brought Thunderbolt!

50:54.468 --> 50:55.760
He'll save us!

50:55.802 --> 50:58.262
Here now, where'd you come from?

50:58.305 --> 51:02.641
- Get out of here, you stupid mutt!
- Maybe they didn't hear you.

51:02.684 --> 51:05.811
Don't worry, kid.
This'll be take two.

51:09.357 --> 51:11.317
That's more like it.

51:15.447 --> 51:18.365
What have we here? It's you.

51:19.618 --> 51:23.496
I owe you a debt of gratitude,
my photogenic little friend!

51:23.997 --> 51:28.793
If it wasn't for you, I'd have never
found your brothers and sisters.

51:28.835 --> 51:31.837
And now I have you all!

51:40.847 --> 51:43.849
Thunder, are you playing dead?

51:46.645 --> 51:51.524
- That hurt. That really hurt.
- I knew you were faking it.

51:53.401 --> 51:56.737
- He's been faking it, all right!
- Lightning, little buddy!

51:56.863 --> 52:02.701
I am not your little buddy,
and you are no Wonder Dog.

52:02.828 --> 52:05.204
This kid trusted you, and
look where it's got him!

52:05.330 --> 52:08.749
- What does he mean? - He's
been lying to you all day, kid.

52:08.875 --> 52:11.585
He doesn't care about
you or your family.

52:11.711 --> 52:17.049
He was just trying to get his name in
the paper and save his job. Ask him!

52:17.884 --> 52:21.804
No! Well, yeah. But... But...

52:21.888 --> 52:26.267
But, but, but. Hey,
genius, you're no hero.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.102
You're a fraud.

52:28.228 --> 52:32.231
And by the way, there never
was a plan to recast you.

52:32.315 --> 52:33.899
I just had to get
you out of the way.

52:36.903 --> 52:40.614
Now I gotta go take
your place on the show.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.658
My show.

52:57.674 --> 53:01.260
Thunder?

53:01.595 --> 53:04.263
I don't understand.
You lied to me?

53:04.347 --> 53:09.602
I put on an act. I'm an actor.
It's what I do.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.520
But you said I could be
yourjunior deputy...

53:11.605 --> 53:15.649
I made all that up! I just needed
someone who knew the script.

53:15.775 --> 53:20.446
- But you said that you'd help us.
- Don't you get it, kid?

53:20.488 --> 53:24.116
All that running around and
saving the day stuff, it's...

53:24.159 --> 53:27.453
It's make-believe!
It's not real.

53:28.496 --> 53:30.122
You promised!

53:32.876 --> 53:35.169
Patch, I just...

53:36.963 --> 53:38.297
You lied.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.343
I'm sorry, all right?

53:44.554 --> 53:46.972
I'm not a real Wonder Dog.

53:47.015 --> 53:50.559
I just acted like one once.

54:08.078 --> 54:12.998
- I'm hungry. - I want to
go home. It's scary here.

54:13.083 --> 54:15.084
Where's Mother?

54:21.508 --> 54:22.841
Patch?

54:24.511 --> 54:27.012
Are you okay? Patch?

54:28.014 --> 54:32.893
Dad was right. I
am just one ofl01.

54:34.896 --> 54:38.148
I'm sorry, Lucky.
This is all my fault.

54:38.191 --> 54:41.694
Hey, didn't Thunderbolt get
out of a cage like this once?

54:41.736 --> 54:45.030
You know, in episode 13,
"The Flaming Flea Circus."

54:45.156 --> 54:46.824
Episode 18.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.410
Episode 18!

54:58.366 --> 54:59.646
Did you see what Patch just did?

54:59.671 --> 55:02.381
Wizard, Patch!
Absolutely wizard!

55:02.882 --> 55:07.261
Hey, shut your yapping! I'm
trying to get me beauty sleep.

55:11.224 --> 55:14.727
Okay, you guys, stick
together and be quiet.

55:32.454 --> 55:34.455
Don't look so put out.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.540
My favourite furrier will
be open in the morning

55:36.583 --> 55:39.209
and then we'll be
out of your hair.

55:40.754 --> 55:45.591
Perfect! Episode 53,
"The Mineshaft Mix-up."

55:45.717 --> 55:49.636
Everybody, stay here until I
tell you it's safe to come out.

55:59.105 --> 56:00.147
What is it with...

56:05.153 --> 56:07.946
- You let the puppies get away!
- You let the puppies get away!

56:08.073 --> 56:10.282
Hold on! They can't
have gone far.

56:10.408 --> 56:11.950
Here, start searching!

56:27.467 --> 56:32.304
When that crazy bird finds out we
lost them again, she'll skin us!

56:32.430 --> 56:33.847
Horace! Jasper!

56:33.973 --> 56:36.809
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing, mum!

56:36.935 --> 56:38.977
We haven't lost the
doggies or anything!

56:39.104 --> 56:40.270
You let them escape?

56:40.313 --> 56:43.607
- Jasper fell asleep! - You
were snoring like a train!

56:46.111 --> 56:48.278
The lift is barking.

56:50.156 --> 56:53.450
The mutts must already
be downstairs.

56:53.493 --> 56:56.787
- Funny how we never heard the lift.
- Shut up, you!

56:59.707 --> 57:02.835
- Come on, they'll be back soon!
- Aren't we going down?

57:02.961 --> 57:05.504
Nope. We're going up!

57:11.219 --> 57:12.845
Ready, Rolly?

57:12.971 --> 57:15.347
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!

57:15.473 --> 57:16.682
Whoa!

57:20.854 --> 57:22.312
Can I do that again?

57:22.355 --> 57:24.189
Okay, now the rest of you.

57:25.859 --> 57:28.902
I'm just saying, maybe the
puppies are still upstairs

57:29.028 --> 57:31.071
and they just tricked us
into coming down here.

57:31.197 --> 57:34.324
Come on now, Horace.
Dogs ain't that smart.

57:34.367 --> 57:37.870
They haven't got the big,
educated brains we got.

57:42.208 --> 57:47.546
97, away! 98, away!

57:47.589 --> 57:49.214
99, away!

57:56.890 --> 57:58.223
Get him!

58:28.254 --> 58:29.880
- Thanks, guv.
- Cheers.

58:33.384 --> 58:35.260
Come on. We're gonna
hitch a ride!

58:50.944 --> 58:53.278
Here they come!

58:59.077 --> 59:01.328
There they are! Get them!

59:03.581 --> 59:05.123
- What happened?
- She pushed me!

59:05.166 --> 59:06.458
Did not!

59:25.353 --> 59:27.980
The crazy lady is
right behind us!

59:51.796 --> 59:53.505
He had a Birdie in his mouth!

59:53.631 --> 59:56.675
You idiots! Here,
take the wheel!

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.189
Speed up, you imbeciles,
or we'll lose them!

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:21.658
Ha-ha!

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.995
That's one! Just 98 more to go!

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:28.040
Okay, okay, quiet on the set.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:32.252
We're rolling! And
action, Wholesome Tommy!

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.213
Lightning, you're one of a...

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.894
Patch, help me!

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:58.278
Well, well, if it isn't the
little half-pint hero again!

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.465
Wow! Check out Patch!

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:57.337
What do we do now, Patch?

01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:02.759
See those windows? We can reach
them from the upper deck!

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.638
You go ahead, I'll
hold them off.

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:08.682
Somehow.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:15.647
Oh, here's a feisty one.

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.658
Thunderbolt!

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:33.165
How you doing, kid?

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:36.501
- But I thought... - Come on,
haven't you seen the show?

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.463
I always arrive just
in the Nick of time.

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:44.885
Look, I may not be a real
hero, but I can act like one!

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:54.519
Lightning, don't
let them hurt me!

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:58.815
Heart. My heart.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:02.152
Lightning, this
might be the end!

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:10.368
She might see us.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:15.040
Give me that! I'll put this
mongrel out of his misery!

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:37.896
Lightning, I can feel the warm kiss
of life ere it parts my cheek.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.400
Do not mourn me when I am gone!

01:03:42.443 --> 01:03:46.029
It is enough that you
were here at the end.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:51.910
Goodbye, old friend.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.378
Good night, sweet Prince!

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:14.826
Dispaoh to Car 47, what's
your situation? Over.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.663
No, no, fellas. I'm
not with them!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.000
I was trying to help
Thunderbolt, honest!

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.461
That's what I do. I'm a
sidekick. We're a team!

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:28.340
Come on, fellas! Come on!
Don't you watch TV?

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:30.842
Now, who's the
pathetic ham actor?

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:34.679
I am painting spots, but she doesn't
like them so good and then she says,

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:37.182
"No, you must kill them,"
and I'm not so sturdy.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.976
She's very mean to me!
And then I pass out.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:44.022
There they are.
Those are the ones!

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.732
- She made us do it!
- She made us do it!

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:48.985
Spots? I do see spots, you know.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.655
They're everywhere!

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:56.201
Spot! Spot! Spot! Spot!

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.165
There they are!
It's wonderful!

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.501
They're all here!

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:07.212
Come now. Stop it. Stop it.

01:06:07.254 --> 01:06:08.880
We were so worried about you.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:12.050
Penny, Lucky, my
darling puppies!

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.845
Patch! You're safe.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.392
We were so worried about you.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:23.895
- We missed you very much, Patch.
- You did?

01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:25.689
Of course, Son.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.736
Mom, Dad, this is Thunderbolt.
He saved us.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.072
I don't know how to thank
you for saving my family.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:37.659
No, no. Don't thank me. It
was your son, Patch, who...

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.995
Mom! Dad! The devil
woman got us.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.746
And we were trapped and
then Patch got us out!

01:06:41.872 --> 01:06:44.499
Yeah. And Patch made
me a trampoline!

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:50.380
You should have seen Patch, Mother. He
was fantastic. Just like Thunderbolt!

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:58.179
You know, they're right, kid.
Me, I'm just an actor.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:03.268

One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog!

They make each meal
a special treat.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.705
Happy dogs are those who eat
nutritious Kanine Krunchies.
