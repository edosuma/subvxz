WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:10.920
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:11.400 --> 00:15.680
It's been 30 years since
we slept together for the first time.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.560
July 8th.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.400
The World Cup Final.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.440
Germany beat Argentina with a penalty
that shouldn't have been awarded.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.680
Maradona couldn't stop crying.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.560
It's for you.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.640
Open it.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.600
I took that photo of you that day.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.160
-It's from <i>Dirty Dancing.</i> You seen it?
-Yes.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.560
-Has anyone told you that you--
-Look just like her.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.400
You were the first. Today.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.000
Do you know where the drawing class is?
Room 101?

01:36.080 --> 01:37.480
It's that one on the left, Baby.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.520
My name is Vanessa.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.800
I think I'm in love.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.680
Who's the lucky one now, Vasco?

02:07.280 --> 02:08.880
You are drawing her, man.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.240
She looks like that girl from the movie.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
What movie?

02:15.520 --> 02:16.720
What's the name of it?

02:18.360 --> 02:20.360
<i>-9½ Weeks?</i>
-No, man.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.160
-Is that the only movie you've ever seen?
-No.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.800
-It's not the only movie I've ever seen--
-She doesn't look anything like that girl.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.640
She doesn't,
but I bet she does similar things.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.680
Have you seen that butt?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.120
Those breasts?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.960
And that mouth? Look at her mouth. My God.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.840
-I'm in love. I'm so in love.
-Shut up and draw.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.560
I've never been so in love.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.240
I'm in love.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.920
Do you know where she's going, Daniel?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.240
-Look what I bought.
-After the World Cup ends…

03:01.000 --> 03:02.280
She's coming with us.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.520
Wait…

03:15.120 --> 03:16.080
I'm sorry.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.200
Can I have a word with you?

03:18.280 --> 03:20.560
-I'm really late.
-It'll be quick, believe me.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.920
Do you see my friend here?
His name is Daniel.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.200
He's talking to his girlfriend.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.720
We were thinking about
traveling to the USA,

03:27.800 --> 03:29.680
right after the World Cup.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.160
We want to know if you're interested
in going on a road trip with us.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.560
-You've got to be kidding.
-No, I'm very serious.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.920
Okay, the answer is no.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.280
It's not <i>9½ Weeks,</i>
it's the other one, of course.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.280
It's the one where they dance, right?

03:49.360 --> 03:53.120
In the end he lifts her up,
a choreography they've been practicing.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.520
She's rich, he's a bum--

03:54.600 --> 03:57.840
Yes, unfortunately, you're the second guy
to make that comparison today.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.880
-Who was the first? Tell me.
-I'm really late. My book.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.080
Business Management. Really?

04:05.160 --> 04:07.400
Not all of us can afford these luxuries.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.560
And the trip? Are you in?

04:10.040 --> 04:13.480
Come on, at least a coffee
so I can try to convince you.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.920
-Say yes.
-I don't even know your name.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.800
My name is Vasco.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.600
Okay.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.600
Only if you lift me up in the air
like Patrick Swayze.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.200
Is it over?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.000
I'm going!

05:25.320 --> 05:29.480
-Baby!
-What about me, I don't exist?

05:29.560 --> 05:31.680
Shut up.
Where's your favorite team jersey?

05:31.760 --> 05:34.600
You know what my favorite team is.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.040
Look!

05:39.120 --> 05:40.920
Guys, attention. This is Vanessa.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.840
-Hi!
-Look at the bald Maradona.

05:43.920 --> 05:49.360
Klinsmann, Gascoigne.
And me, of course, I'm Roger Milla.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.000
Of course, and I'm the only girl?

05:51.080 --> 05:54.280
Don't worry. They are coming.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.360
Baggio is here. You know him from college.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.880
-Baggio, where are the beers?
-I can't find them.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.000
We have to take the picture.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.600
-You don't have a jersey.
-No, what about you?

06:04.680 --> 06:07.120
Don't worry. Wanna see it?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.600
It's like I've just scored a goal.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.040
Guys, let's take
our time-honored group photo.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.880
Daniel, the camera.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.440
-Quick.
-The match is about to start.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.800
This guy goes to the kitchen
and doesn't bring beer?

06:27.040 --> 06:30.560
-Squeeze in.
-Come, Vanessa, hurry up.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.880
Baggio, leave the beer and get over here.
I want to hear you say "Cameroon."

06:35.960 --> 06:38.720
Cameroon!

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
Cameroon!

06:40.480 --> 06:42.320
Cameroon!

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
Cameroon!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.680
Deutschland!

06:52.240 --> 06:54.760
Man, a penalty goal
and this is how this dude celebrates?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.320
Is this guy from Belas Artes?
Never seen him.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.360
No, he's from Técnico.
They don't need much to be happy there.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.560
Why are there so many hookers at Técnico?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.480
That's where their clients are.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.880
Did you know
that a prostitute saved Van Gogh?

07:10.120 --> 07:13.800
So the guy threatened
Toulouse-Lautrec with a knife

07:13.880 --> 07:15.360
and ended up cutting himself.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.320
What does a prostitute
have to do with that?

07:17.400 --> 07:21.320
Crazy old Van cut off his ear
after getting mad at Lautrec,

07:21.400 --> 07:24.200
wrapped up the ear
and gave it to the prostitute,

07:24.280 --> 07:27.640
and she took it to the police,
who found him at home, bleeding out.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.600
Imagine if he
and Toulouse-Lautrec weren't friends.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.000
-It wasn't Lautrec, it was Gauguin.
-Yes.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.600
Both were Impressionists.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.880
They worked side by side,
they were interested in the same things,

07:38.960 --> 07:40.400
they painted about the same issues.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.800
They were close.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.600
And…

07:44.680 --> 07:49.120
they had an argument,
and crazy old Van lost his ear.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.680
I bet that Lautrec cut his ear off.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.080
-It was Gauguin.
-Light some fire on that one.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.840
You're taking too long to finish it.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.920
-Are you asking for permission?
-Yes.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.160
Good, let's do it.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.080
Yes, sir. That's good.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.960
You got lucky
not having to face Italy in the final!

08:20.040 --> 08:22.560
If you faced Italy in the final…

08:27.680 --> 08:33.080
Look at this onion,
the quality of this onion!

08:36.320 --> 08:37.920
Did you forget your girlfriend?

08:39.080 --> 08:40.040
Thank you.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.240
Why do you think people prefer to be
in the kitchen whenever there's a party?

08:51.720 --> 08:52.600
I don't know.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.480
It must be an ancestral thing.
Because of the oven or something.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.040
It was the warmest part of the house.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.680
Or because we're close to the fridge.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.000
You and Vasco are going away soon.
Are you happy?

09:14.280 --> 09:16.040
We never spoke about that, you and I.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.080
We've never spoken about much.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.760
-Were you upset?
-No.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.320
If I didn't know Vasco, I'd be upset.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.560
But since I know what a douchebag
he can be, I don't mind.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.240
It doesn't mean it didn't hurt you.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.640
It was your trip.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.760
I showed up
and it got cold between you and him.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.280
Now it's your trip.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.840
Maybe you can go with Francisca one day.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.600
-Francisca…
-What about her?

10:02.240 --> 10:03.800
I'm not with Francisca anymore.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
Since when?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.440
-Do you want a specific date?
-I do.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.280
Since the Cameroon-Romania match.
Milla scored two goals.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.520
You're single for a whole month
and I didn't even know.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.520
You say it like it's a good thing.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.760
It is good to me.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.880
How many people will mistake you
for that movie girl in America?

10:41.960 --> 10:43.640
That movie is terrible.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.880
Patrick Swayze is much older.
He's probably twice her age.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.000
He can only play the bad guy,
the angry guy, or the sweaty guy.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.800
Nobody learns how to dance on a bridge.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.120
Why is her name Baby?

10:54.200 --> 10:57.840
Probably because of that scene
where she's in the corner.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.000
I have a secret to tell you.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.560
What?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.840
It's my favorite movie.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.400
-If you tell anyone, I'll kick your butt.
-No.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.240
I have to go drag Vasco's corpse home.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.200
I'm going to Carlitos to have a drink.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.840
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.800
You like her, don't you?

12:03.320 --> 12:05.000
Your camera.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.800
Of course. It's Japanese.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.720
-I think I prefer Asians.
-Me too.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.880
This was made in Tokyo, in the '70s.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.800
Not cheap, but it has an incredible sound.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.560
-Can you play "Hungry Eyes"?
-Of course.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.280
It's too sharp for my voice.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.560
I can't.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
Do you know who sings very well?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.080
Marco Paulo?

12:37.160 --> 12:39.560
No. Vanessa.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.520
I swear, when I heard her,
I couldn't believe it.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.240
That girl is full of hidden talents.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.400
-Get yourself someone like that.
-I already have.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.160
Do you know what they say
about photographers at Belas Artes?

12:55.240 --> 12:57.400
They all end up photographing weddings.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.480
No way, man.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.600
Watch out.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.800
-It was a penalty.
-Are you kidding?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.600
-It was a penalty.
-It was full of fouls!

15:00.080 --> 15:00.960
Goodbye.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.280
Wait, how long has it been?

15:50.360 --> 15:51.640
-A year?
-Like, two.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.280
-A year and a half.
-What are you waiting for?

15:57.360 --> 15:59.840
Maybe we have a different pace
than other couples.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.720
Whatever, I'll be
meeting his parents next weekend.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.640
Are you nervous?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.800
I'd be more nervous
if he was going to meet my parents.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.520
Why?

16:12.600 --> 16:15.400
Daniel is so cool. He loves you.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.280
You could be Saddam Hussein
and Jane Fonda's daughter.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.280
-What's wrong with Jane Fonda?
-Aerobics.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.160
Really?

16:25.240 --> 16:28.200
It's bad for pregnant women.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.040
No, I'm not pregnant.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.920
But I've decided I'll be a gynecologist.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.680
What's wrong with your parents?

16:37.640 --> 16:39.760
My parents plan weddings.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.640
Daniel's friends were teasing him
about being a photographer.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.440
A wedding photographer.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.520
-The lowest in the category.
-Yes.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.600
Last time I saw you,
you were dressed up like a soccer player

16:56.480 --> 16:58.840
from an African team.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.280
That is not true.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.520
That is the last time
you remember seeing me.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.720
I am Marta.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.000
Last time you saw me,
you were as high as a kite.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.400
-How are you?
-Great.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.200
Very well. As you can see.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.200
We just watched Mansell
win the Estoril Grand Prix.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.080
How did Senna do?

17:24.160 --> 17:27.000
-I love Senna.
-He got third place.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.400
Yesterday we saw
Michael Jackson in Alvalade.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.520
Didn't he sing "Man in the Mirror"?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.720
No, we had to leave before it ended.
Isabel was distressed.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.360
What a shame.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.640
That song is good for you.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.360
Is it?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.440
Why do you say that?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.360
It says something about…

17:52.760 --> 17:55.520
if you want to change the world,
start with yourself.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.840
Wow, nice! That is very nice.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.400
Burn.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.360
I almost forgot
that you were the one who kicked me out.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.800
Didn't you know?
I was replaced by my best friend.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.760
The great Daniel.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.160
How is he?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.440
Did he become a renowned photographer?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.080
What do you want, Vasco?

18:24.440 --> 18:27.880
I still have the tickets
for the USA trip, remember?

18:30.480 --> 18:32.640
Why don't you take Isabel?

18:33.120 --> 18:36.400
Isabel is French.
They don't get along well in the USA.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.280
Here.

18:44.000 --> 18:44.920
That's my number.

18:45.640 --> 18:46.600
Use it.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.760
I know that everyone has their tastes,

18:58.840 --> 19:02.560
but did you leave this guy
to be with Daniel?

19:21.480 --> 19:22.680
You're very tense.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.240
Relax, everything will be all right.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.520
You didn't tell me
your parents were millionaires.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.920
It's old money.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.200
And rotten.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.520
Old man.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.480
Hi, I'm Vanessa.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

19:57.560 --> 20:01.280
Vanessa, this is Gertrudes.
She's worked here ever since I was little.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.520
Give me a kiss, Gertrudes.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.240
Let's go.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.000
Vanessa, these are my parents.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.880
-How are you?
-Mother.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.000
-Hello.
-Have you been well?

20:16.080 --> 20:16.920
Yes.

20:22.360 --> 20:26.560
My Isfahan silk rug.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.240
Gertrudes!

20:30.800 --> 20:34.080
What are these kids thinking?

20:47.720 --> 20:49.280
Pass me the salt, please.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.600
-What?
-The salt, please.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.160
Bring another salt shaker. Quickly.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.960
-Did Father catch the pheasant?
-Speak louder, Daniel.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.880
Why do you have to whisper?

21:10.960 --> 21:13.480
I'm not whispering,
this is my normal voice.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.560
I hunted this pheasant this morning.
The shot hit him right in the chest.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.280
Right, Jonas?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.840
It's not for me, it's for Mr. Bacelar.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
Thank you very much.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.600
And what does Vanessa do for a living?

21:40.120 --> 21:41.800
Don't tell me you're like my son

21:41.880 --> 21:44.280
and chose the wildness
of an artistic life.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.720
Vanessa studied Business Management, Dad.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.040
You're shouting, Daniel.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.040
Business Management. Very well.

21:56.040 --> 22:00.440
Maybe she'll make enough money to pay
for the Persian tapestry she ruined.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.880
I didn't mean it. I didn't know--

22:02.960 --> 22:05.200
Speak louder, for the love of God.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.960
-No one can hear you with those whispers.
-I was saying I didn't know--

22:11.040 --> 22:14.240
Don't tell me that I have to be
the one picking up the dishes.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.720
Gertrudes!

22:16.880 --> 22:19.280
Maids are not
what they used to be anymore.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.040
-And the farm, how's it going?
-Just as we left it.

22:23.120 --> 22:28.760
I need someone to take over,
someone with business experience.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.320
Like your friend.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.200
Vanessa is my girlfriend, Dad.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.760
What farm are you talking about?

22:35.880 --> 22:39.560
The Bacelar family farm.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.440
It's been with us for five generations.

22:45.120 --> 22:49.400
Unfortunately, your father
is so busy shooting ducks,

22:49.480 --> 22:52.960
he can't find a foreman,
someone qualified.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.200
I love the farm. You know that.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.160
That would be funny,
Daniel taking care of it.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.480
What would he do there?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.240
Set up a photography studio?

23:04.320 --> 23:07.120
A photography studio for the poor.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.600
Misfortune is fashionable these days.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.480
Do you really
let them talk to you like that?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.240
Stop ringing that shit!

23:31.120 --> 23:31.960
Vanessa.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.640
Vanessa, stop! I told you my parents--

23:34.720 --> 23:36.120
I have to go, I'm sorry.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.200
-It's hard to find taxis this late.
-I'll take a chance.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.320
You're barefoot.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.200
Damn!

24:05.280 --> 24:08.000
I need a shower.
I don't want to talk about this.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.040
-I spent the night--
-You don't have to--

25:14.080 --> 25:15.160
You go first.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.280
I spent the night at Marta's house.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.520
I needed to be alone.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.640
Will you marry me?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.320
Okay.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.960
But I have to tell you something.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.760
Okay.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.720
My parents are poor.

26:10.760 --> 26:11.680
Okay.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.080
They have a restaurant
on the brink of bankruptcy.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.400
Okay.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.560
And they plan weddings.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.760
I think it's the right moment for this.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.880
What's going on?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.080
You have no idea what just happened.

28:10.320 --> 28:11.320
What?

28:13.160 --> 28:15.680
-I sold my first photograph.
-Stupid!

28:15.760 --> 28:19.520
-I sold my first photograph!
-Do you want to kill me?

28:19.600 --> 28:20.880
That's great!

28:22.080 --> 28:23.480
Take it easy.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.720
It's a small gallery,
and so is my commission.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.360
Yes, but I don't have to prostitute myself
to pay for the wedding.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.680
-Let's not go that far.
-How wonderful!

28:33.160 --> 28:35.840
-I already know what to do with the money.
-What?

28:35.920 --> 28:38.120
-We're having lunch with your parents?
-Yes.

28:39.240 --> 28:44.120
My love! It's so good to see you!

28:44.680 --> 28:45.680
How are you?

28:45.760 --> 28:48.200
You've grown. You're taller, man.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.280
-Let me through.
-Where's Dad?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.880
-He's outside, punching life in the face.
-What's going on?

28:53.960 --> 28:57.240
I'm very worried about him.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.320
So many punches have been thrown at him,

29:00.400 --> 29:04.680
I fear he'll lose his mind
and start hallucinating.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.760
Like that American
who went out of his mind.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.120
Take this, dear. Let's have lunch
and talk about your wedding.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.200
Your sister and I want to know everything.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.240
-Take this, I'll call Dad.
-No, I'll go.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.720
Is it true
that it helps to relieve stress?

29:39.120 --> 29:42.200
When I fought, that word didn't exist.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.320
Stress.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.840
Now I think I know what it is.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.040
One day, I'll teach you how to box.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.160
No.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.280
I'd rather die of smoking.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.360
They say it's useful in desperate times.

30:02.960 --> 30:08.440
And desperate times
call for desperate measures.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.200
What measures?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.480
The business…

30:18.120 --> 30:21.480
it will last until summer, at the most.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.960
After that, we'll just have to
pay off our debts and swallow our pride.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.400
Don't worry.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.320
What if I told you
I have something that can fix it?

30:38.960 --> 30:43.720
As you know,
I don't like official ceremonies.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.360
Weddings.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.960
I also don't like bachelorette parties,
but this one is mine.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.760
Sorry.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.440
Vanessa.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.080
Please, don't tell me I sang well.

31:58.440 --> 32:03.320
Singing in front of an audience
makes everyone nervous.

32:03.960 --> 32:04.840
It wasn't that.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.280
What then?

32:10.280 --> 32:13.640
How do you know
that you're doing the right thing?

32:14.720 --> 32:17.400
You, for instance, you're single

32:18.080 --> 32:20.600
and you like to be single,
you don't get attached.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.320
How do you know that's what you want?

32:25.800 --> 32:27.840
It's funny that people see me like that.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.560
It's probably the clothes I wear.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.200
In fact, I get attached to everything.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.160
Too much.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.520
That's why I avoid relationships.
They break me.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.680
I understand you.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.920
How was I a few years ago,
when I was with Vasco?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.280
More cheerful?

32:53.160 --> 32:56.000
More enthusiastic? Less boring?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.400
No, you were never boring.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.760
I feel tamed, you know?

33:04.840 --> 33:08.040
Like I've been thrown into a cage.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.320
-What did Daniel do to you?
-Nothing.

33:15.960 --> 33:20.320
My parents' business went south
and Daniel offered help.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.280
But even that, I don't know…

33:23.760 --> 33:25.320
Things are going very fast.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.440
Change is hard,

33:30.360 --> 33:32.600
especially when it requires
a big commitment.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.440
-How do I know if this is what I want?
-You don't.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.040
You can't know.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.560
It's like me with my guitars.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.520
I have five, but the one I like the most
is my first one.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.360
<i>That old one, the '74 Yamaha.</i>

33:54.440 --> 33:58.360
<i>It's not the best one,</i>
<i>not the most expensive…</i>

34:00.840 --> 34:03.600
<i>but it's the one that has been with me</i>
<i>through good times and bad.</i>

34:07.280 --> 34:10.280
-Did that help you in any way?
-A little bit.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.440
-No.
-No?

34:13.520 --> 34:15.360
-No.
-It's not a favor.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.760
-It's a rental.
-Rental?

34:18.400 --> 34:22.000
How are you paying for it?
With the photography studio for the poor?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
Here's the first three months' rent.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.960
-How did you--
-It doesn't matter how I got it.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.960
-There's more where that came from.
-Are you sure?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.600
I've never been so sure.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.880
You'll regret it.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.600
Maybe not now, in a few years. Who knows?

34:48.680 --> 34:51.160
In 25 years or so.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.200
Don't worry, Dad.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.320
I thought Marta was coming with you.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.240
I don't want anything, thank you.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.640
You called my office. What do you want?

36:05.280 --> 36:08.160
-I heard you were getting married.
-You heard?

36:09.080 --> 36:11.040
You showed up at my bachelorette party.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.240
It wasn't a bachelorette party.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.720
It wasn't. I hate that stuff.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.120
Me too.

36:21.040 --> 36:25.120
-I think you made the wrong decision.
-Now we're friends, is that it?

36:25.200 --> 36:28.360
-Marta was busy and sent you instead?
-I don't care about her.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.800
I'm only dating her to stay close to you.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.800
-I'm crazy about you.
-Don't be stupid.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.520
-It's two years since we spoke--
-Because you won't return my calls!

36:35.600 --> 36:39.160
-I was with Daniel. I am with him.
-Are you happy with him?

36:39.240 --> 36:40.920
Or do you still wake up thinking about me?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.400
-We still have time, Vanessa.
-Go to hell.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.880
Vanessa!

36:50.640 --> 36:53.320
Vanessa, talk to me, please.
Vanessa, wait.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.080
-Talk to me. Wait.
-Leave me alone!

36:58.160 --> 36:59.320
We had plans.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.320
We had plans, and you ran away.

37:02.400 --> 37:05.840
-I made a decision.
-But you came back, didn't you?

37:05.920 --> 37:08.560
-On that night, you came back.
-It was a mistake.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.600
How can you be sure it won't happen again?

37:11.680 --> 37:15.400
How can you be sure
that every time you think about your life,

37:15.480 --> 37:19.640
about the poor choice you've made,
you won't feel like shit?

37:31.800 --> 37:33.200
You betrayed Daniel.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.720
You were friends,
and you were going on a trip.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.160
No. I didn't betray Daniel.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.440
I went after
what was most important to me.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.000
You.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.520
Don't get married.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
Stay with me.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.680
Let's go to the United States.
To wherever you want.

38:03.760 --> 38:07.080
Let's go tomorrow, let's go today.
Now. Let's go now.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.720
I'll lift you in the air
like Patrick Swayze does in the movie.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.280
You're so beautiful.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.720
I'm terrified.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.480
-I never apologized to you for--
-No, it's okay.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
The important thing is that you're here.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.280
And she's also here.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.720
-Who's that weird guy seated there?
-I don't know.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.360
His name is Mário.
I got him on short notice.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.480
He was a teacher, now he's into weddings.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.000
What?

40:29.840 --> 40:31.160
Mário, the notary.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.680
And that kid is his son,
his name is Dário.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.320
I'm so nervous.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.400
Of course.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.520
You weren't supposed to see the bride
before the ceremony.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.440
We were never the ones to follow protocol.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.240
Jesus!

40:58.320 --> 40:59.520
Breathe.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.000
Deep breath.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.160
One, two, three, four.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.120
Baby.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.440
This is my dancing space.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.240
-That is your dancing space.
-Okay.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.440
I don't break into yours,
you don't break into mine.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.360
You have to hold the frame.
