01:32.009 --> 01:34.010
Enjoy this, motherfucker.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.681
Who died?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.350
No one yet. What?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.186
Looks like I woke you up
this time, huh, Ari?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.480
No, but you did wake
my wife and kids, dickhead.

01:45.564 --> 01:48.733
Vinnie better be sitting in prison
with a DUl or something. Is he?

01:48.817 --> 01:51.152
- No.
- Then what do you want, cunt muscle?

01:51.361 --> 01:52.570
I'm sorry about
the family, all right?

01:52.863 --> 01:54.614
- Speak.
- It's Monday morning,

01:54.782 --> 01:57.450
we have the number one movie,
officially, and you promised us offers.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.118
Oh, there will be offers.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.288
Be in my office at 11:30
and you'll hear all about 'em.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.873
- Nice.
- Oh, and E?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.626
You have to get up a hell
of a lot earlier than this to wake me.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.419
Yeah yeah yeah.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.088
"Cunt muscle"?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.844
- What's the rush?
- You don't want to be late for Ari.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.679
- Not on a big day like today.
- Seriously, Vin,

02:18.764 --> 02:20.389
they're gonna be offering
you everything under the sun.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.099
You don't wanna miss it.
Get in the car.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.435
- Shut the door.
- Start the car, Turtle.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.645
Let's go.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.146
Yo, cocksuckers, wait up.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.524
- Fuck!
- Oh, I see.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.776
Does this mean I'm really
not getting everything under the sun?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.361
Out, Turtle.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.283
When is this nightmare
gonna end?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.327
It's not going to,
so you better get used to it.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.912
Sorry I overslept, boss.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.081
- So where to? The Jew agent?
- Whoa whoa, Dom...

02:45.374 --> 02:46.499
you don't talk
like that out here.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.125
What? They frown
upon the word "Jew"?

02:54.091 --> 02:57.051
Seems you got a lot of problems
with how I carry myself, E.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.470
Just trying to help you
avoid new problems is all, Dom.

02:59.555 --> 03:03.432
What kind of new problems? I'm not
the same old Dommy. I'm a new Dom.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.643
I've been rehabilitated
by the State of New York.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.396
And they believe
in me, so should you.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.356
Come on Vinnie,
you're making bank.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.024
You can't get your boy
a whole shirt?

03:12.109 --> 03:14.193
- You talking to me, jerk off?
- ARl: Take it easy, Dom.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.612
I just don't want you to excite
my man here. He's into bad boys.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.072
Aren't you, Lloyd?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.450
Not.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.619
Come on in, boys.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.248
If the Oriental even looks at me,
I'm taking him down.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.791
Hey, Dom,
you're out here with us.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.669
- Right, Ari?
- You know what?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.130
Today, and today only,
I'm gonna open up my doors

03:34.214 --> 03:36.257
like Ellis fucking Island.
Come on in.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.302
Bedraggled wretched crew,
watch me work my magic.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.096
He must have
something good.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.806
He must have
something great.

03:44.850 --> 03:45.892
"Flight. "

03:45.976 --> 03:47.685
"Dead Poet's Society"
in space.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.562
Character-driven, great script,

03:49.646 --> 03:51.105
Darren Aronofsky
is directing.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.858
They're offering you
$8 million.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.447
"The Sandman. "
You are a retard at a Red Cross tent

03:59.531 --> 04:02.909
in the Sahara. It's "Being There"
meets "Lawrence of Arabia. "

04:03.160 --> 04:05.536
David O. Russell's directing,
they're offering you

04:05.621 --> 04:07.538
- $9 million.
- Take it, Vin.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.168
We got a stack
of great ones just like those.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.253
So what's the point, Ari?

04:14.338 --> 04:16.088
The point is that
they all want our boy,

04:16.173 --> 04:18.132
but what our boy wants,
we gotta work for.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.300
What do I want?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.063
Is this what goes on in here
when we're out in the hall?

04:32.147 --> 04:33.814
The line starts behind me,
motherfuckers.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.445
This ain't blow.
It's powdered cream.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.156
- What the fuck is going on, Ari?
- Yeah, Ari, what's up?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.325
We're going to the coke capital
of the world, that's what's up.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.245
- "Medellin. "
- "Medellin"?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.081
- "Medellin"?
- "Medellin"... boom!

04:50.165 --> 04:53.000
You're gonna play Pablo fuckin' Escobar,
just like you wanted.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.961
- I thought that script was dead.
- It was dead.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.796
Then Phil Rubenstein
gave it CPR.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.506
He saw "Aquaman,"
and he loved it.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.967
Holy shit!
Who's Phil Rubenstein?

05:01.051 --> 05:04.095
He's only the animation king,
made like $600 trillion.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.097
Made like, "Madagascar"
and "Shrek. "

05:06.306 --> 05:08.975
And now he wants to work
with real people, and he loves you.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.434
- That's great!
- That's not all.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.269
Paul Haggis is directing it.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.146
First thing since
he crashed the Oscars.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.400
- Paul Haggis?
- He loves you too. Only one problem...

05:17.484 --> 05:19.318
we gotta get
Phil Rubenstein to say yes.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.653
How do we get
Phil Rubenstein to say yes?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.906
We go to Santa Barbara
and we charm his pants off. All right?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.200
He's gonna throw a kickoff party
for his new cult wine,

05:26.284 --> 05:28.035
- and he invited us.
- Us?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.413
- I do know my wines.
- I have to clear it

05:30.497 --> 05:32.540
with my parole officer if I'm
going across county lines, Vince.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.084
- Can the boys come?
- They can come. He needs sleeves.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.505
I'm just saying, tell this guy
he can show you the money

05:39.589 --> 05:41.132
or tell him he
can suck your dick.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.467
Dom, it's a little
more complicated than that.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.178
Yeah, how so? I just heard the agent
tell Vince he has multimillions

05:46.263 --> 05:48.597
in offers waiting. But you're
making him get on his knees and beg.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.057
You don't think
I'm out of line here, Vince?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.101
Not at all, Dom, I think you're
making some good points.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.103
- Thanks, Vince.
Yo...

05:54.521 --> 05:56.939
How good is this shirt
gonna look on me?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.858
Not as good
as it already looks on me.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.527
Too slow
to the draw, hombre.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.487
You can change now.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.993
He's making
some good points?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.787
Call Ari and tell him
I'm not going to Santa Barbara.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.665
Vince, this is the movie
we wanted to do, all right?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.168
It's a chance for you to act,
get away from the blue screen

06:17.252 --> 06:18.794
and the animatronic fish.
This is our "Scarface. "

06:18.962 --> 06:21.213
Tell him to make an offer and then
we'll talk. 'Cause I ain't kissing

06:21.298 --> 06:23.299
- no fucking ass, man.
- Are you serious?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.302
No, I'm not serious.
You know I'd kill to do this movie.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.471
But why do you have to argue with Dom?
You said you were gonna try

06:28.555 --> 06:30.556
- to get along with him.
- I'm trying all right? But the guy is

06:30.640 --> 06:32.683
talking about your career and he
doesn't know what he's talking about.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.102
Yeah, I'm just trying to get him on his
feet. Let him spin his wheels a little,

06:35.187 --> 06:37.396
it's not a big deal.
It'll build his confidence.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.065
Will you just
help me do that, please?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.357
Okay.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.943
Yo, we gotta leave now
if we wanna beat Santa Barbara traffic.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.863
Don't worry about the traffic, Turtle.
I've arranged for us to skip it.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.990
Really?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.962
You know, sitting here
in this expensive suit,

07:02.047 --> 07:04.173
flying in this
expensive helicopter,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.967
going to an expensive
guy's house,

07:08.178 --> 07:10.513
I finally feel like
I made something in my life.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.140
Thanks, Vince.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.852
I'd feel the same fucking way
if I was wearing that shirt.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.984
Look at this fucking spread.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.737
This guy can make you
a $10 million offer, no problem.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.572
And once he hangs
with Vince for five minutes,

07:28.657 --> 07:30.366
- that's what he's gonna do.
- Exactly.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.328
Vince, being charming
is all about body language, bro.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.955
Vince knows
how to charm, Drama.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.667
Yeah, women, but man charm
is a totally different animal.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.877
You gotta get in
close enough to entice,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.213
but not so close
as to encroach.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.549
What do you say we forget
kissing-the-ring bullshit

07:46.633 --> 07:48.634
and I get close to this guy
while you're talking to him?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.302
Apply a little pressure.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.012
No, don't do that, Dom.
In fact it'd be really great

07:52.097 --> 07:53.430
if you don't talk
to Rubenstein at all.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.059
I didn't say I was gonna talk. I won't
say a word. I'll just stare like this.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.021
Hey hey!
You boys are looking sharp.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.399
Hey, thanks, Ari.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.525
Actually I meant the other boys.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.152
Which one's Rubensteinberg, Ari?

08:06.236 --> 08:09.530
It's Rubenstein, and please,
don't try to pronounce it again.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.448
Vinnie, let's go get us a gig.
You ready?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.658
Hey Vince, remember...

08:13.952 --> 08:15.619
Not too close.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.918
Got any hard alcohol
in this place?

08:23.003 --> 08:26.088
'Cause the pruno I made in the joint
tastes better than this shit.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.050
Wow, this wine
is great, Phil.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.720
- Congratulations.
- I'm glad you like it, Vince.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.638
And I just screened "Aquaman"
and you were great.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.015
- ARl: Ahh!
- Thanks.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.018
I just saw "Madagascar" with my nephew
and that was really great.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.477
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.229
In fact, if you have
any open animals in the sequel

08:42.313 --> 08:43.563
I'd love to be involved.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.233
Great. What kind of an animal
could you see yourself playing?

08:46.318 --> 08:50.279
Um, I don't know.
A cheetah maybe?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.364
A cheetah.
That's great.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.242
Great. You're both great.
Let's make a deal.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.912
Ari, could you leave
Vince with me for a bit?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.622
Uh, yeah.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.248
Great. Come on, Vince.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.792
I'll show you the vines
where I handpick my pinots.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.506
I get toffee, mocha...

09:11.259 --> 09:13.427
...and a hint
of terra firma.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.346
Terra firma
is dirt, Drama.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.015
Yeah, well wine
comes from dirt, E.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.018
I gotta take a leak.
I'll be back.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.770
It kind of smells like
lead pencils to me.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.230
What does it smell
like to you, Ari?

09:24.314 --> 09:26.273
Don't stick a glass
in my face, Turtle.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.942
What's with the attitude?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.276
Stop freaking out, Ari.
Vince will be fine.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.819
They've been out there
for 20 minutes, man.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.904
What are they talking about?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.948
I'm sure Vince is just
charming his ass off.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.158
It's just a matter of time
before he locks the deal.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.785
As long as Dom don't fuck it up.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.828
Huh?
- Look.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.914
ARl: Fuck.
Jesus.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.546
It's nice to see you still have
your childhood friends around you.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.258
Kid never forgot where he came from,
never went Hollywood.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.301
Except I think he tweezes
his eyebrowses now.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.971
Hey, Dom,
let's go get a drink, buddy.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.973
- I got a drink, E.
- Grab another one, they're free.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.099
Come on, all right?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.309
It's okay, Ari.
Talking to Dom, I get a real sense

10:02.394 --> 10:04.395
who Vince is
and where he came from.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.522
Yeah, I'm sure Phil hung out
with some pretty crazy guys

10:06.606 --> 10:08.274
back in the neighborhood
where he's from, huh?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.652
Of course. In fact, I had
a childhood friend in Great Neck

10:11.736 --> 10:13.279
whose family was...

10:14.072 --> 10:15.948
Jewish mafia.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.783
Ah, the best kind.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.743
How would you like
to hear a story

10:19.828 --> 10:21.453
that will sum up
exactly who Vince is

10:21.538 --> 10:24.290
- and exactly where he comes from, Phil?
- I'd love to.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.960
About 10 years ago, me and Vince
were out at some dive bar in Queens...

10:28.044 --> 10:29.628
- Oh.
... and he hooks up

10:29.713 --> 10:33.590
with this hot piece of ass, as usual.
And he blows out.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.343
Me, I stay, I get
zonked out of my mind,

10:36.428 --> 10:38.178
I stumble out into
the middle of the street

10:38.263 --> 10:41.140
and I see my fucking car's
been stolen.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.434
I don't know what to do,
so I call the fuzz,

10:43.518 --> 10:45.769
I fill out all the paperwork,
but it's 40 below

10:45.854 --> 10:47.396
and I'm freezing
my balls off.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.107
So I ask 'em, "Can I stay
in the back of the squad car?"

10:50.191 --> 10:51.650
They say, "Yeah,
sure, no problem. "

10:51.735 --> 10:54.653
I'm sitting there, Phil,
for 20 minutes

10:54.738 --> 10:56.697
when it fucking hits me:

10:57.657 --> 11:00.868
I didn't drive. My car wasn't stolen,
it was parked at my house.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.995
Ha ha, that's a funny story.
Let me ask you something, Phil...

11:03.079 --> 11:04.496
That's not the funny part.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.081
Here's the funny part, Phil:

11:06.583 --> 11:09.001
Fucking cops run a check
on my registration.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.670
It comes back I got three bench warrants
out for my arrest.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.297
Bam, that's it.
They got me.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.425
No fuss, no muss. I'm already locked
in the back seat of their car.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.093
Fucking idiot I am,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.554
I turn myself in by accident.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.562
- That's hysterical, Dom.
- And touching...

11:28.646 --> 11:31.190
'cause I call Vince up 3:00
in the fucking morning

11:31.274 --> 11:34.193
and the kid busts open
his piggy bank and bails my ass out.

11:34.277 --> 11:37.696
And the best part?
The hot broad that he had with him

11:37.781 --> 11:40.616
had a good-looking sister.
Right, Vince?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.995
Still to this day, Phil,
the best lay I ever had.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.622
That's the kind of guy
Vince is.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.958
He's a brother to me,
and I love him.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.253
- To friendship.
- ARl: There we go.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.380
To friendship.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.465
Now you've said
something there.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.968
You mad I told that story?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.513
No, I'm not mad. It was a good story.
Great story.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.556
Yeah, except it was me
that bailed you out

12:04.641 --> 12:05.808
and picked up
the two hot sisters.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.226
What?
Drama, you're delusional.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.602
What were you
drinking tonight?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.479
Paging Mr. Escobar...

12:11.064 --> 12:12.648
Mr. Pablo Escobar...

12:13.149 --> 12:14.149
Don't fuck with me, Ari.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.151
You're gonna get
an offer in the morning.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.694
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.655
- Amazing, thank you!
- Thank you, Vinnie, are you kidding me?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.532
Rubenstein said he could tell
that you're a street kid

12:21.616 --> 12:23.867
- and you get this world.
- Yeah, thanks to Dom's story.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.578
- Stop it. Come on, man.
- Dom, you did a good job.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.497
- Tell him, E.
- Nope.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.748
Great job, Dom.
Come here!

12:32.210 --> 12:34.962
Going to Colombia, baby!
Coming through in the clutch!

12:49.227 --> 12:50.436
E, I'm getting used to him,

12:50.520 --> 12:51.770
but could we at least
soundproof his room?

12:51.855 --> 12:54.773
You got it, Turtle.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.734
- So we got an offer?
- No, we got a problem.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.528
Oh, don't tell me that, Ari.
Not today.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.447
- You said you were sure.
- I was.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.031
Just got off the phone
with Rubenstein's people.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.576
Somebody robbed his house
at the party last night.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.661
- What?
- Stole the original Shrek doll

13:07.745 --> 13:10.914
right out of its apparently-impossible-
to-break-into case.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.708
- Jesus.
- Cops are all over it.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.294
I don't have to tell you, E, if this
comes up smelling bad for us,

13:15.378 --> 13:16.920
you can kiss
Bogota goodbye.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.630
Why would it
come up bad for us?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.507
I'm thinking about
your new housemate, E.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.842
Ari, there were
300 people there.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.720
Well 299 of them
didn't serve time!

13:24.804 --> 13:26.305
That's a big fucking accusation.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.973
I'm not making it.
But when Rubenstein,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.225
who is so distraught
over this he can't get out of bed,

13:30.310 --> 13:33.061
remembers Dom's little
jailhouse stories... he will.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.356
So what did they get?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.566
The original Shrek doll.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.486
You can rule out Turtle.
He'd only take a doll he could fuck.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.114
- They got any leads?
- No, but Ari thinks he does.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.742
- Morning, fellas.
- Morning, Dom.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.037
Hey, Vin, any way you could
spot me a couple of bucks?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.873
I found this new service.
The broads are hotter but pricier.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.583
No problem.
On my dresser.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.086
Be right back to season
out the blandness of Drama's cooking.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.589
Heh.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.009
- Come on, E. No way.
- I don't want to point the finger

14:04.093 --> 14:06.762
but I'd like to be sure before
everyone else inevitably does.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.931
Okay, fine, we'll talk to him,
but there's no way.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.268
You want us to sweep
the house for that doll? Just in case?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.353
- No.
- Yes.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.271
Just in case.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.400
Let me guess. I'm making
too much noise with the whores.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.694
I can ask them
to bring it down.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.196
You know,
they fake those screams.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.781
They're just
for effects anyway.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.115
The girls are fine, Dom.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.159
So what's up, then?

14:29.244 --> 14:30.619
I mean, you got me
real nervous here.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.622
Somebody robbed Rubenstein's
house last night,

14:33.831 --> 14:35.374
took something
very valuable.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.625
And you think
it was me?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.002
- I hate askin'.
- You are askin'.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.462
Or is E askin'?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.756
Dom, we both hate askin',
but the cops are gonna ask

14:42.840 --> 14:44.716
and we'd feel better
if we spoke to you about it first.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.136
Jesus Christ. My past
will always haunt me, huh?

14:49.347 --> 14:50.430
I'm sorry, Dom.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.933
Nah, you shouldn't be.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.144
Truth is, I have stolen. Plenty.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.981
And I hurt lots of people
in my lifetime.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.608
But I didn't do this.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.655
I mean, you guys know me
since I'm eight years old.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.366
Have I ever done anything
to hurt either one of you?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.409
- No.
- No.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.077
And now that you've
been so good to me,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.829
and allow me back
into your home

15:13.913 --> 15:16.164
like no time has passed,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.709
why would I do this now?

15:21.337 --> 15:22.629
You believe me,
right, Vin?

15:23.006 --> 15:24.506
I believe you, Dom.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.592
E?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.511
Yeah, Dom.
I believe you.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.058
You're out
of your fucking mind.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.893
I played poker with
this guy for 20 years.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.645
He has a worse tell than
Malkovich in "Rounders. "

15:38.730 --> 15:40.272
Did you see him?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.441
I've played poker with him too.
I don't remember that.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.817
It's disgusting, stop!

15:43.901 --> 15:45.485
Vince, I'm telling you,
he did it.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.237
I'm telling you
I don't think he did.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.450
Should we hit a titty bar?

15:51.534 --> 15:52.909
It's 10:00
in the morning, Dom.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.795
I don't see shit.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.130
Yeah, me neither.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.215
Now put that stuff
back the way it was.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.887
Was the red shirt
on top or was the white?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.222
You gotta be kidding me.
I told you to remember

16:14.307 --> 16:16.391
exactly what everything was like
before you touched it!

16:16.476 --> 16:18.977
Well I forgot, okay?
So what do you suggest I do now?

16:19.062 --> 16:20.312
- Just throw those out.
- What?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.897
Those two shirts,
throw 'em out.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.774
If he sees that everything
is out of order,

16:23.858 --> 16:25.859
he's gonna think we were
snooping around in here.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.528
But if it's just gone,
the fuck's he gonna say?

16:28.613 --> 16:31.281
- Brilliant.
- Just do it, Turtle, and keep looking.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.033
Where else?
We looked everywhere.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.915
Yo, they're coming,
they're coming!

16:40.792 --> 16:42.668
Don't be so panicky.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.504
We didn't
do anything wrong.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.630
Did you find anything?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.424
No, but I may have
figured out a way

16:49.509 --> 16:51.551
- to descramble the pay-per-view.
- For real?

16:51.636 --> 16:53.095
- Yeah.
- Nice.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.513
Fuck are you guys doing?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.723
We were just
checking out the plumbing.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.849
You find anything?

16:57.934 --> 16:59.768
- No.
- All clear.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.732
Yo, we gonna be able
to get Spice?

17:05.817 --> 17:08.694
It represents
a turning point in my career, in my life!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.529
Phil, I understand
you're upset.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.030
I am upset for you, okay?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.074
But you can't just
go randomly pointing a finger.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.202
- I mean, this is America.
- My maid saw him upstairs, Ari.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.662
Maybe he had to
use the bathroom.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.747
Because there was a problem
with the 10 I have downstairs?

17:22.290 --> 17:25.335
Phil, I feel
for your loss, I do.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.545
But we can't go
throwing away

17:26.628 --> 17:28.797
a huge movie that's
gonna be as special

17:28.881 --> 17:31.508
as "Shrek" someday
based on a hunch.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.386
A hunch is what got me to drop out of
law school against my family's wishes.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.722
And I have a hunch now
that I know who did this.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.474
But I don't even care
about catching him.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.101
I just want my doll back!

17:41.185 --> 17:43.562
Come on, we'll make a little
Pablo Escobar doll, Phil,

17:43.646 --> 17:45.147
and we'll put it
in Shrek's place.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.819
Phil? Phil? Phi...

17:53.865 --> 17:56.742
- The doll or "Medellin"?
- The doll or "Medellin. "

17:56.826 --> 17:58.618
I don't know what you want me to say
'cause we don't have the doll.

17:58.703 --> 17:59.870
Then you don't
have "Medellin. "

17:59.954 --> 18:01.872
What, do think I'm hiding
the fucking thing, Ari?

18:02.039 --> 18:05.041
What I think is that
you guys have got blinders on.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.126
No, I think you just
grew up in a place

18:06.210 --> 18:07.419
where it's okay
to accuse anyone

18:07.503 --> 18:09.004
who doesn't look like
they went to Harvard.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.506
No, I grew up in a place
where if you're accused of something,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.592
chances are you've done
something wrong.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.135
Yeah, well Vince doesn't
think he did it,

18:15.219 --> 18:16.511
so what the fuck do you
want me to tell you, Ari?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.013
Tell me if you
think he did it.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.892
Ah! So you do.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.769
Look, it doesn't matter what I think.
We need proof.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.438
Oh, is that all?
Well, why don't we go get some?

18:30.359 --> 18:33.236
I only brought five shirts with me
and two of them are gone.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.071
Can't help you, Dom.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.450
40% of my wardrobe goes missing
and you guys don't know dick about it?

18:38.534 --> 18:39.534
Nope.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.245
- Vince?
- They don't wear your size, Dom.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.081
Hey, what's going on?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.292
What's going on is
we know Dom took the doll.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.294
- Ari...
- Vinnie, I got proof.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.796
Fuck you,
you don't got shit.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.674
Listen, you return the doll
and everything will be forgiven, okay?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.468
There's nothing to forgive
'cause I don't got it.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.803
All right, what kind
of proof do you have?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.638
Security tapes
from Rubenstein's house.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.640
You think the guy's got
a billion dollars in the bank

19:01.724 --> 19:03.558
and doesn't have
cameras everywhere?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.310
The jig is up, baby.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.853
- Dom?
- He's bluffing.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.897
- Am I?
- Yeah.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.899
'Cause I didn't steal it,
so I can't be on that tape.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.657
- I'm gonna press play.
- Press it.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.326
And if I'm on there
I'll suck your cock on Rodeo Drive.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.037
But if I'm not, I'm gonna
crack open your fuckin' head.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.163
Either way, I lose.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.624
Yeah, either way you lose,
so fuckin' press the button.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.876
All right, you ready?

19:36.551 --> 19:38.552
Aw, Jesus, Ari!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19:38.636 --> 19:40.011
Hey, any shots of us
at the bat mitzvah?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.805
- ARl: All right, I'm bluffing.
- I'll fuckin' kill him!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.181
ARl: Put Shrek back
in his cage!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.517
I did this to
save your ass, okay?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.811
- Ari, get the fuck out.
- Everyone knows this guy did it.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.646
This is the worst thing
you've ever done. Get out.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.148
I'm gonna call you later.
I'm leaving on my own.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.236
- Hey, Vince...
- You know what? Fuck you too, Eric.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.029
- And fuck you guys.
What did we do?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.615
Dom's our boy
since we were kids.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.577
Have we gone so Hollywood
we forget how to treat family?

20:03.661 --> 20:06.830
You know,
fuck this movie, E.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.540
In fact, fuck Hollywood.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.126
I would rather
be working at the Dairy Barn

20:11.210 --> 20:12.836
than to listen
to people accuse my boy.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.964
You know why? 'Cause I know
Dom would never intentionally

20:16.048 --> 20:17.799
do anything
to fuck me over.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.389
- You know, don't you?
- I do now.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
- Know what?
- How?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.143
You scratched your neck when
you told Ari he was bluffing.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.811
- Really?
- See, that was his tell in cards,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.063
not that stupid shit
you keep doing.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.607
I feel like shit about this.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.692
Where the fuck is it, Dom?

20:40.531 --> 20:42.073
I knew we needed
a strip-search.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.117
No, you knew
you wanted a strip-search.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.120
You know you could have
cost Vince this movie?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.622
- I didn't mean to.
Why did you do it?

20:48.706 --> 20:51.499
I don't know, Vin. I seen "Shrek"
like 400 times in the joint,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.376
you know, 'cause you
can't watch adult content.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.921
And when I saw it,
I just grabbed it.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.173
I was gonna put it back,
I swear to my mother,

20:58.257 --> 21:01.217
but this one maid, she kept looking
at me the whole night like she knew.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.637
Thought about
taking her out to protect you.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.680
But then I thought it
was just best to deny.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.935
No excuses,
but I am sorry.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.771
Yeah, I'm sorry too, Dom.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.940
I'm gonna go see
if I can catch Ari.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.191
I'd wash that.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.402
That little monster spent the night
inside the most unsavory woman.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.112
Jesus.
Here, put that in the sink.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.615
And I wouldn't call Ari.
I wouldn't even return it.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.950
No body, no crime.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.952
Look, he said all we gotta do
is return the doll and we're all good.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.244
It's the oldest trick
in the book, E.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.664
You'll return it,
they'll still slap the cuffs on me

21:30.748 --> 21:31.790
and take away
the movie.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.293
- He's right.
- Yeah, you're right.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.171
That's the best career advice
you've ever given, Dom.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.547
I got an idea.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.928
Come on, guys, admit it.
You miss him a little.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.054
A very little.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.305
He's only at the Oakwoods.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.100
A Hummer and an apartment.
That's not a bad severance package.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.686
No, not bad at all.
This is it.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.610
Rock, paper, scissors.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.404
No, I'll do it.
I got the better arm.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.531
Please.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.509
- Afternoon, Lloyd.
- Hey.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.928
He's just finishing up
a call, but go on in.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.766
You two, out.
It was a one-time thing.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.063
What's the word, Ari?
Got anything new to report?

22:37.148 --> 22:38.523
Yeah, I just got
a call from Rubenstein.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.608
Apparently they found
his doll somehow.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.068
Oh!

22:42.153 --> 22:43.778
- So we're all good then, right?
- No, we're not.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.905
Just got off the phone
with Warner Brothers.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.866
They're so excited about
the "Aquaman" opening

22:47.950 --> 22:49.784
that they've green-lit
"Aquaman 2."

22:50.578 --> 22:52.787
- Well that's good, no?
- Naw.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.791
Start date is September 8th,
same day as "Medellin. "
