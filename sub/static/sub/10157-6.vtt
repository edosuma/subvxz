WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:13.014
What the fuck was that?
Fuckin'-- What the...

00:14.473 --> 00:17.351
--Ugh. Ooh.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.736
- Hello?
- Hey. Sorry if that was strange.

00:26.820 --> 00:31.074
Uh, yeah. I mean,
it was super crazy, but, uh...

00:31.157 --> 00:32.742
good crazy, I guess.

00:32.826 --> 00:34.786
-Oh, you liked it?
-Yeah.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.542
Well, we should hang out.
What's your week look like?

00:40.625 --> 00:44.295
Yeah, um...
Well, I work tomorrow,

00:44.378 --> 00:46.255
but I don't really
have anything the day after.

00:46.339 --> 00:48.507
I mean, I do,
but I'd have to move stuff around,

00:48.592 --> 00:50.509
so maybe, like, Thursday.

00:50.594 --> 00:51.886
What about tomorrow night?

00:51.970 --> 00:53.638
Yeah. Uh...

00:53.722 --> 00:57.308
No, I got like a night shoot thing,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.936
so I wouldn't really be able to meet up
until, like, midnight-ish.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.980
I'll be up midnight-ish.

01:02.897 --> 01:06.275
Okay... I guess I'm just
thinking out loud here,

01:06.359 --> 01:09.028
is that like a weird time
for a proper date?

01:09.112 --> 01:14.408
Just, like, call me whenever you're done
with work and we'll just hang out.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.327
Uh... great.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.832
Well, uh...
Let's do a midnight-ish hang then, huh?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.792
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

02:18.556 --> 02:23.061
We kissed and then she was like,
"Do you wanna meet tonight at midnight?"

02:23.144 --> 02:25.354
So that has to be, like,
a booty call, right?

02:25.438 --> 02:26.731
Something's different about you, man.

02:26.815 --> 02:28.983
Like, you got a whole new swag to you
or something, man.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.360
It's your glasses.
Where your glasses at, dude?

02:31.444 --> 02:32.737
No glasses. Contacts day.

02:32.821 --> 02:33.822
All right. Okay.

02:33.905 --> 02:35.865
-Well, welcome back, confident Gus!
-Yeah.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.616
Haven't seen this dude
in, like, two weeks.

02:37.701 --> 02:39.786
-I know it's been a while, huh?
-Yeah, man.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.579
Got to admit,
I got a little pep in my step.

02:41.663 --> 02:42.872
-I see those moves, man.
-See that step?

02:42.956 --> 02:45.416
-I see those, killer! Get down.
-Yeah, totally, man.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.127
Cruikshank, from way downtown!

02:48.211 --> 02:49.253
Oops!

02:49.337 --> 02:51.756
Can't buy a bucket!

02:51.840 --> 02:54.008
Sorry, didn't mean to do that.

02:54.092 --> 02:56.010
I got... Thanks.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.971
-What's up?
-Hey, yo, Wyatt!

02:58.054 --> 02:59.305
Get at that hummus, dog.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.557
-Pine nuts on top, very jiggy.
-Mmm.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.852
Hey, Wyatt, uh,
so the Lakers won last night,

03:03.935 --> 03:04.936
I was thinkin' of ya.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.814
You were thinking of me?
That's cute.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.775
-Oh, like, 'cause you like the Lakers...
-Uh-huh.

03:10.859 --> 03:12.276
...and then I saw the Lakers won, so...

03:12.360 --> 03:14.028
Lot of people like the Lakers, bro.

03:14.112 --> 03:15.113
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Yeah.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.073
You know Gus here
wrote a Witchita script, right?

03:17.156 --> 03:19.700
You did? He did?
You wrote a Witchita spec?

03:19.784 --> 03:22.787
-Yeah, for, like, fun. But, uh...
-Don't listen to him, don't listen to him.

03:22.871 --> 03:25.289
Not for fun.
For, like, to get a job.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.665
You wanna be a writer?
I didn't know that.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.126
Would you wanna read it, or...

03:28.209 --> 03:30.044
You can send it to me.
I'll try to read it.

03:30.128 --> 03:31.337
-I can take a look.
-You know what? I actually...

03:31.420 --> 03:32.839
-I got a hard copy.
-Oh.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.717
Yeah. Ah. Yeah!

03:35.800 --> 03:36.843
You're like a boy scout.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.344
Hey! I was a boy scout.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.429
Hey! That's so cool.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.642
Well, now that everybody's finally here,
we can start the meeting.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.561
- Great.
- So, is there any outstanding business?

03:48.229 --> 03:51.357
- Yeah, I have a couple small things.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.567
But, uh, the main problem is

03:53.651 --> 03:57.864
we are just not getting good calls
from our listeners.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.491
I don't know why.
So, what I suggest is

04:00.574 --> 04:04.578
we start employing some of those
in-house, not 100% real calls...

04:04.662 --> 04:05.914
I don't think
we should be doing that.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.290
I just think it's unethical

04:07.373 --> 04:10.126
and some of the listeners would be upset
if they knew calls were faked.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.671
People don't care if the calls are real.
They care if the advice is real.

04:13.755 --> 04:15.840
You see that, right there?
That poster?

04:16.758 --> 04:20.219
The show is called
Heart Work with Dr. Greg, okay?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.763
Just make the calls.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.871
Hey, Britney, what is new
in the world of wardrobe?

04:46.955 --> 04:48.873
-Hey, Gus.
-Hey, I don't know if you noticed,

04:48.957 --> 04:51.500
but they kinda got the AC cranked on
in there and I'm a little chilly.

04:51.584 --> 04:52.919
Do you mind if I borrow a jacket?

04:53.002 --> 04:55.088
Sure, but don't spill any food on it.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.755
-Oh, no, I won't.
-Here.

04:57.841 --> 05:00.259
Oh. You know what?
Uh, I kind of like this one.

05:00.343 --> 05:03.805
I think it'd be a little warmer, too.
Mind if I wear this bad Larry?

05:03.888 --> 05:05.598
-Sure.
-Yeah? Great.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.141
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.894
-Don't let anything happen to it!
-Oh, of course not.

05:09.978 --> 05:13.982
Ooh! Yeah, I like this.
Feel like Indiana Jones.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.483
Be careful with it.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.776
- Right, thank you! Oop, hey.
- Easy.

05:18.611 --> 05:20.864
I worked with Chace Crawford
on this stupid thing.

05:20.947 --> 05:23.908
He said that on Gossip Girl
their trailers were, like, super trife.

05:23.992 --> 05:27.786
That's so not surprising.
Warner Brothers is the fucking worst.

05:27.871 --> 05:28.913
Like, I don't even know why--

05:28.997 --> 05:30.206
They just don't know
how to treat their actors.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.290
Yeah, they don't.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.625
Okay, okay, guys. Come on.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.543
We're getting off track.
Way off track.

05:34.627 --> 05:35.794
So don't let me regret that I said

05:35.879 --> 05:37.796
you didn't have to
sit in your seats today, all right?

05:37.881 --> 05:39.715
-Mmm-hmm.
-Keep it loose,

05:39.798 --> 05:41.592
but we gotta focus, all right?

05:41.675 --> 05:45.179
All right, what do we got here?
"Mitosis."

05:45.263 --> 05:47.390
Jacob, what's mitosis?
Lookin' at you, buddy.

05:47.473 --> 05:52.395
It's a cell and then it splits
and then they're, like, exactly the same.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.397
Perfect.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.233
Couldn't have asked for a better
definition myself. That was good, yeah.

05:57.316 --> 06:00.153
You seem like you're in a really
good mood today. Am I wrong?

06:00.236 --> 06:01.570
- Do I?
- Yeah.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.780
- Yeah, super good mood.
- Yeah.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.864
Do I seem, like, in a good mood?

06:03.948 --> 06:05.408
- Like really happy.
- Yeah, like--

06:05.491 --> 06:06.700
I guess so.
I guess I'm in a good mood.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.619
Good for you, man.
What's going on?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.371
Uh... nothing.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.957
I shouldn't get into it.
It's kind of personal.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.208
-Hey, come on. Yeah.
-Come on.

06:14.292 --> 06:16.627
- We're all friends here. Get into it!
- Yeah!

06:17.336 --> 06:19.422
-I'm meeting a girl tonight.
-Oh-ho!

06:19.505 --> 06:21.715
-Meeting a girl.
-Oh! Player!

06:21.799 --> 06:24.260
- Getting that time in.
- Yeah, wear a condom, Mr. C.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.138
All right. Now I regret telling you guys.

06:27.931 --> 06:32.435
I bought her the dog because she...

06:32.518 --> 06:35.688
Well, man, I can't remember,
is this before--

06:35.771 --> 06:37.898
This must be before I met her parents.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.650
I should've brought this up
at the beginning of the story.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.196
So anyway, she travels a lot for work

06:43.279 --> 06:49.118
and this has become a thing lately
where I was willing to let it go and say,

06:49.202 --> 06:51.162
"All right, it's a one-time thing."

06:51.245 --> 06:56.292
Uh, but then, the other week,
she went to Atlanta,

06:56.375 --> 06:58.419
and I'm just at home trying to--

06:58.502 --> 07:01.422
Gotta cut you off there, caller,
so sorry about that.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.841
Thanks so much for sharing,
very intense stuff.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.595
We'll be right back on Heart Work,
this is Dr. Greg Colter.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.643
Mickey!

07:14.727 --> 07:17.563
God! Dr. Greg,
please don't make me do this.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.689
These calls suck,

07:18.772 --> 07:22.110
and I'm sure you have plenty of
fucked up experiences to draw from.

07:22.193 --> 07:23.611
Or make shit up.
I don't care.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.695
Fine.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.326
Welcome back to Heart Work,
we have Mindy on the line.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.494
Mindy, what's happening?

07:31.577 --> 07:36.624
Hi, Dr. Greg. Long time, first time.
I'm a 48-year-old, never-married woman.

07:36.707 --> 07:41.212
I am a huge fan. Like, if you had a book,
I would sleep with it under my pillow.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.174
I'm just wondering with relationships,

07:45.258 --> 07:47.135
how do you know
if they're gonna be good or bad?

07:47.218 --> 07:49.262
Okay, can you be more specific?

07:49.345 --> 07:53.099
Well, I'm in a new relationship
with this guy.

07:53.182 --> 07:58.187
Okay, surely there must be something
more interesting about your situation.

07:58.271 --> 07:59.272
How did it all start?

08:01.607 --> 08:02.608
Well...

08:03.817 --> 08:06.737
he went on a date with my roommate
and before he could leave,

08:06.820 --> 08:09.657
I grabbed him in his car
and started making out with him.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.325
Wow.

08:11.409 --> 08:14.287
That's a powerful initiating move.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.164
I have...

08:16.247 --> 08:19.000
let's just call them
impulse control issues.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.210
Uh, alcohol and whatnot,
so I just wanna make sure

08:21.294 --> 08:22.795
they don't affect this new relationship.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.423
Okay. Are you in
some sort of a program?

08:26.090 --> 08:30.678
Yeah, AA. But, like, yesterday I told
everybody I was sober when I'm not.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.806
Careful.
If you make your sobriety into a joke,

08:33.889 --> 08:36.684
then it's your life
that becomes the punch line.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.728
Mmm-hmm. I don't--

08:39.812 --> 08:41.772
I don't understand.
So what's the problem then?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.150
Well, she's not, I mean,
she's not a person, you know?

08:44.233 --> 08:45.818
You need to--
But she can understand.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.029
Like, you need to talk to her
when you feed her. Hey, one sec.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.822
Hi! Gus? Hi.

08:49.905 --> 08:50.906
I'll call you back.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.033
Hi. Heidi.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.451
-Heidi, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.786
We met like four episodes ago,
or something.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.955
-Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember you.
-Yeah, I play Elise on the show.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.916
- Elise, the cousin.
- Or so we think.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.087
Oh. Are you not--
Did they change it?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.713
-Is that something new that's happening?
-Oh, no.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.466
I'm just being silly, that's--
They didn't change it.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.675
-I'm the cousin.
-Oh. Okay.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.885
-Yeah.
-I was like, "Oh, spoiler!"

09:11.969 --> 09:15.306
Yeah, I think, um, this actually
might be my last episode.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.640
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.559
-Oh, that's crazy.
-I know.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.063
Well, I don't know. My contract's for four
and, like, they might ask me back, but...

09:22.146 --> 09:24.357
Do they hate me?
I feel like they hate me.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.609
-Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
-No?

09:26.692 --> 09:27.943
Hey, the first few months I was here,

09:28.026 --> 09:30.446
I thought everybody thought
I was a huge dork.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.782
- Oh!
- Yeah. They were wrong.

09:33.866 --> 09:34.950
You showed them.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.535
No, you know honestly,
with this show,

09:36.619 --> 09:38.871
it's kinda like everybody
keeps their heads down

09:38.954 --> 09:40.081
-and focuses on their own work.
-Right.

09:40.164 --> 09:43.041
-Sure.
-I know it can feel like people hate you,

09:43.126 --> 09:44.460
-but no, they don't. No.
-Yeah, okay.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.213
The only time you should worry
is if they cut your line.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.090
Or if they kill you.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.384
- Not you. Your character, yeah.
- Not me.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.761
Hmm, yeah, that's probably true.
I hope.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.179
--Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:55.263 --> 09:58.932
-Um, well, thank you.
-Oh, of course. Yeah, cool.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.227
Um, well, I guess I will see you...

10:01.310 --> 10:03.604
at the gathering of the coven!

10:03.687 --> 10:05.648
- Ooh, okay.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.441
-I'm not gonna, like, do it like that.
-Of course.

10:07.525 --> 10:09.402
-Cool. Okay, bye-bye.
-But, yeah, okay. Bye!

10:10.403 --> 10:12.696
Just a hunch here, Mindy.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.325
Do you substitute quick,
casual sex for real intimacy,

10:16.409 --> 10:18.661
just because it's the easier thing to do?

10:18.744 --> 10:22.706
Maybe with friends and associates,
or even people you work with?

10:24.708 --> 10:25.793
Yeah, you could say that.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.129
But I'm trying not to do that
with this new guy.

10:28.212 --> 10:31.215
Well, do me a favor
and give me this new guy's number,

10:31.299 --> 10:35.594
so that I can call him and tell him
to run away as fast as he can.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.221
Ha, ha! Okay.

10:37.305 --> 10:39.890
I'm not joking, Mindy.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

10:39.973 --> 10:44.937
You're not going to find yourself
magically in some non-toxic relationship,

10:45.020 --> 10:47.606
unless you face your other demons first.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.192
Yeah, but that's what I'm doing.

10:49.275 --> 10:50.359
I've seen the pattern.

10:51.652 --> 10:55.698
Sex, instead of
what I like to call "real courtship."

10:55.781 --> 10:58.033
You are bingeing on this new guy.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.910
Now, people think
that you can only binge on food,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.496
but that's not true.
You can binge on other people, too.

11:02.580 --> 11:05.166
And then before you know it...

11:10.879 --> 11:11.880
What's that?

11:13.048 --> 11:17.386
That was you.
Melting down. Exploding.

11:18.721 --> 11:22.015
Now I feel like you're exaggerating,
or just picking on me.

11:22.099 --> 11:27.938
I'm not. I just need you to understand
that whether it is food, or drugs,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.899
or some new guy,
whose got your heart all aflutter,

11:30.983 --> 11:34.820
they all lead to the same things
as an addict.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.282
Jails, institutions and death.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.450
Fuck this.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.078
These are harsh words, Mindy,
but you gotta hear 'em.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.414
Thank you for your call.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.001
Next up on the line,
we've got Georgio.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.586
Georgio, what's happening?

11:50.669 --> 11:52.004
Hey, Dr. Greg.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.299
So, I was dating a woman for
a couple years and, uh...

11:55.383 --> 11:59.387
we broke it off and five months in,
now we're still having sex, constantly.

11:59.470 --> 12:02.306
You know, uh...
more than we ever had before and, um,

12:02.390 --> 12:04.182
basically, what I'm trying to say is...

12:04.267 --> 12:05.768
I think I'm in love with her mom.

12:06.477 --> 12:07.645
Wow!

12:07.728 --> 12:10.939
Didn't see that one coming, Georgio.
Thank you for surprising me.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.992
Hey, lady.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.412
Hey. Just a heads up,
some stuff came up at work

12:24.495 --> 12:27.247
and it might be kind of tough
for me to, uh, meet up tonight.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.084
Oh. Uh... okay.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.129
Um... what's up?

12:34.212 --> 12:35.506
Is everything okay, or...

12:35.589 --> 12:37.425
Yeah, no. Uh, everything's fine.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.677
Um, can we just play it by ear?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.971
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure, um...

12:44.682 --> 12:46.559
Is something wrong, or...

12:46.642 --> 12:48.436
You know, it's...

12:52.064 --> 12:55.776
It's just, I-- Oh, I'm so sorry.
I gotta go. I'm late for a meeting.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.321
I'll call you later, okay? Bye.

12:58.904 --> 13:02.282
Are you still there?
The signal...

13:39.570 --> 13:41.655
-Hey, Wyatt.
-Hey, man.

13:41.739 --> 13:45.826
Hey, um, I was actually thinking about it
and you don't need to read my script.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.245
I know you're a busy guy.
And I'm just having second thoughts.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.664
Oh, I read the first, like,
ten pages already.

13:50.748 --> 13:52.375
-Oh, you did!
-Yeah, kid, you did good.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.959
-Oh, you're gonna sit down?
-Oh. Awesome.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.962
Yeah. So what'd you think?
Are they, like, okay, or...

13:57.045 --> 13:59.382
-So, there's good stuff in there.
-Okay.

13:59.465 --> 14:00.508
A couple of big thoughts.

14:00.591 --> 14:03.802
One is that the witchcraft
has to feel real.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.763
-Right.
-And like Susan Cheryl always says, like,

14:05.846 --> 14:08.223
"If you were a witch, what would you do?"
So make it more...

14:08.306 --> 14:10.225
-a little more character-based.
-Right. That's a good note.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.727
-The dialogue...
-Uh-huh.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.061
-Forget the dialogue for a second.
-Sure, sure.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.813
-Another important thing is that...
-Mmm-hmm.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.401
...we need a big thing on Witchita
to happen every three pages.

14:18.484 --> 14:19.902
That's a Susan Cheryl mantra.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.570
-So, a twist, a turn.
-Every three pages.

14:21.654 --> 14:23.155
-Yeah, something big.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.991
Um, I don't want this to seem like
I'm just shitting on your script.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.869
Oh, my God,
I just appreciate you reading it.

14:28.952 --> 14:29.953
-You know?
-Oh, you're welcome.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.455
-Or part of it. Yeah.
-Yeah. Totally. Um, for sure.

14:31.539 --> 14:35.292
And, you know, 'cause I'm not...
like, a real writer,

14:35.376 --> 14:37.002
-you know? I just wanted to try.
-Right.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.921
Or thought it'd be fun
or interesting to try.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.088
Yeah. No, we all start somewhere.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.799
-Yeah. Yeah.
-So, for sure.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.552
Um, they are about to rehearse
the bedroom scene,

14:44.635 --> 14:46.136
and I wanna get over there
to look at that.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.931
Really? Man, they haven't even started
shooting the bedroom scene?

14:49.515 --> 14:52.184
No. Stuff got pushed.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.811
I thought we were supposed
to be done at midnight.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.730
Do you have somewhere to be
at midnight tonight?

14:56.814 --> 15:00.901
Oh, um... I'm not sure, actually. But...

15:00.984 --> 15:02.653
-Okay. Um, good talk.
-Okay.

15:02.736 --> 15:03.946
-Yeah, great talk.
-I gotta get over here.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.280
I thought that was, like, a great talk.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.157
Cool. Yeah, no. That's awesome.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.076
Hey, sorry.
We need that jacket back.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.078
What? Why?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.996
You shooting a scene with it
or something, or...

15:13.080 --> 15:14.665
-No.
-Well...

15:14.748 --> 15:17.710
can't I keep wearing it?
Just let me wear it a little longer.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.337
-Don't forget.
-I won't.

15:20.421 --> 15:21.630
Everyone does.

15:21.714 --> 15:23.674
-I know, but I won't.
-You promise?

15:23.757 --> 15:27.344
Yeah, just look for the guy
in the brown leather coat and that's me.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.512
-Okay, I will.
-Okay.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.016
Two nights ago,

15:33.100 --> 15:36.019
I touched the first piece of white pussy
I've touched in at least six years!

15:36.103 --> 15:37.813
- Atta boy! Mmm!
- Hey! But, like, no--

15:37.896 --> 15:40.483
I feel like it's prejudiced...
It's racist to high five you about it.

15:40.566 --> 15:43.360
No, it's not! It's just that ever since
I was young, like,

15:43.444 --> 15:45.112
black girls like me,
white girls don't like me.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.864
Frankly, I can't believe
anyone likes you.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.699
--I'm surprised anyone fucks you.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.117
--Oh, there he is!

15:50.200 --> 15:52.202
- Ah!
- Oh! My dicklickers!

15:52.285 --> 15:53.662
Come on, come on, man, bring it in.

15:53.746 --> 15:54.830
-Bring it in.
-How you doin', lil' dicklicker?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.289
-What's up, buddy?
-Come on, bring it in.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.584
-How you feeling, man?
-Not ideal, not ideal.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.420
I mean, I don't have anybody
to hang out with except you fools.

16:02.505 --> 16:05.466
So if that gives you any indication
of where I'm at.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.342
Hey, I know you.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.886
Oh...

16:08.969 --> 16:10.137
I don't know you.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.640
What is your name,
you gorgeous little Nazi princess?

16:12.723 --> 16:13.724
Mickey.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.684
Wait, you don't fucking know Mickey?
She's the fucking shit.

16:15.768 --> 16:16.769
Yes, she is.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.897
Whoa, what's that hair thing?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.817
- All right. To us!
- Cheers!

16:23.901 --> 16:26.987
- To fucking us.
- To us! And cancer!

16:27.070 --> 16:28.572
Whoa! Yeah.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.826
Let's talk DNA.

16:32.910 --> 16:37.414
Okay, so DNA is just, uh,
how life happens.

16:37.498 --> 16:40.083
So, no big deal. Um...

16:40.167 --> 16:43.837
Aidan, come on. No cell phones, man.
You know that. Put it away.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.257
So DNA is, um...

16:48.091 --> 16:49.092
Wait, is that...

16:50.803 --> 16:53.013
Is that my phone?
Do you have my phone?

16:53.096 --> 16:55.432
What do you got there, man?
Like, how did you-- What?

16:55.516 --> 16:56.934
--You can't just leave it on the desk.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.018
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

16:58.101 --> 16:59.937
How do you not have it password protected?

17:00.020 --> 17:03.524
'Cause I'm from South Dakota, okay?
We don't lock things.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.651
Does Mickey know
you're from South Dakota?

17:05.734 --> 17:06.944
I bet she does.

17:07.945 --> 17:10.656
Did I send-- What did you text?

17:10.739 --> 17:13.867
"I'm hard AF just thinking about tonight."

17:13.951 --> 17:15.994
-Come on, man.
-Calm down, he's doing you a favor.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.370
Girls love that shit.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.331
No, they don't. Do they?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.916
Well, it's--

17:20.999 --> 17:22.292
Don't answer that.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.294
Normally, I'd be into it,

17:24.377 --> 17:27.130
but he's kind of dorky,
so it's surprising.

17:27.214 --> 17:32.094
Oh. Now he's a "hard AF" dork.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.846
-"Hard AF"?
-"Hard as fuck."

17:35.138 --> 17:38.350
That's dorky.
That's... No, that's sexy.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.479
Guys, that's not cool, okay?
What you did isn't cool.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.022
Wait, did she write back yet?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.066
No, she hasn't.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.569
Oh, the only thing I see is something
that she wrote beforehand

17:48.652 --> 17:50.362
that I didn't even see. Uh...

17:51.905 --> 17:54.032
"Poss on."

17:54.116 --> 17:55.701
What does that mean? Don't...

17:55.784 --> 17:58.621
Okay. Fine.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.000
Why are you so mad?
I was only trying to help.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.169
Okay, you know what, guys?
Can we all just stop talking?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.964
Please? Thank you.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.188
-Oh, wait, he's texting.
-What?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.398
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.941
Oh, almost. Nothin'.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.317
What do you think he was gonna send?

18:29.401 --> 18:31.486
Probably a picture
of his tight little butthole.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.782
Just was afraid
to pull the trigger.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.951
The hot sauce, you had it out here.
It's gone.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.453
- Where the fuck did you meet him?
- Can I get, um... uh, cilantro?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.997
Cilantro? There's no cilantro?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.082
-No, there's nothing here!
-Look, look.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.959
No, I found some,
I found some.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.837
--Oh, you found some? What you doing?

18:48.921 --> 18:51.799
- I'm looking for the hot sauce.
- Ah!

18:51.882 --> 18:53.175
- I feel bad!
- I need to plug my phone.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.677
I need to plug my phone in.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.429
- Oh!

18:58.639 --> 19:01.684
No plug there, señor, I'm sorry.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.893
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:02.976 --> 19:05.603
- Come on, Andy!
- What are you doing?

19:05.688 --> 19:06.897
- Let go.
- Get--.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.733
I just am gonna plug the thing in.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.985
-That's embarrassing.
-There's a plug right there.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.696
I'm gonna plug it in for five seconds.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.698
- Five seconds.
- He's your friend, dude.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.199
- Where are you-- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

19:17.282 --> 19:19.242
You can't come in, sir!

19:19.326 --> 19:20.786
- I don't want trouble.
- Andy, Andy...

19:20.869 --> 19:22.412
I just want a little juice.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.081
Just give me five minutes.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.791
Hey, I'm in the taco...

19:25.874 --> 19:27.542
- Wait, wait.
- Take a picture real quick.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.711
-Take a picture.
-One, two, three.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.462
Smile!

19:31.839 --> 19:34.842
You smoke that pole like Bette Davis.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.054
But you don't have her crooked eyes.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.266
You got--

19:44.351 --> 19:46.269
Now you look like Bette Davis.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.271
- Bette Davis!

19:55.028 --> 19:56.780
Where's Doobie?

19:56.864 --> 19:59.532
What-- I'm here.
Doobie's gone.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.284
Gone? Why is he gone?
It's so early.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.995
You know...
Why is that such a shitty thing?

20:03.078 --> 20:04.162
It's only 12:25.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.456
- So what? Where's lover boy?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.291
Wait, I-- You were meeting up with him.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.127
Guess he's still at work.
Fuck, I don't know.

20:10.711 --> 20:11.712
Have you heard of ayahuasca?

20:11.795 --> 20:13.505
Yes. Do you have some?

20:13.588 --> 20:15.924
No, but I have the next best thing.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.009
What?

20:21.096 --> 20:22.973
-Two black buttons?
-Oh, oh.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.186
Oh, yeah.
No, it's not--

20:28.270 --> 20:29.604
-What is that shit?
-Sassafras.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.189
That's basically ecstasy.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.441
No, it's the...

20:33.525 --> 20:35.903
Okay, maybe.
But it... it's organic.

20:35.986 --> 20:38.530
They make it from...
They make it from sassafras roots.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.198
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.492
We could go to a safe place.
I know a safe place.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.369
-Okay, where?
-LA subway.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.538
-Fuck, no! No!
-No. No, no!

20:46.621 --> 20:50.458
At this time of night there's nobody there
and it's beautiful mosaic tile.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.419
We'll see things.
We'll see our future.

20:52.502 --> 20:55.630
-Let's take it and then we'll be sober.
-All right, fuck it.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.175
- I'm gonna empty it onto my tongue.

21:02.930 --> 21:04.389
Ew.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.064
You're not gonna feel it right away.

21:17.194 --> 21:18.236
Come on!

21:18.320 --> 21:19.905
You get the tickets.
I gotta text.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.907
Well, hurry up,
you harlot!

21:27.579 --> 21:30.207
-Oh!
-Oh... shit!

21:31.875 --> 21:33.043
Oh, fuck!

21:37.422 --> 21:40.217
Oh, my God,
are these the brightest lights ever?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.761
No, that's the...
that's the drugs kicking in.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.557
You know, I-- Maybe not. I--
That's the thing about drugs.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.643
I can never tell if this is just
my normal level of paranoia.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.897
'Cause look at her, she's like...
She just looked right at me.

21:53.981 --> 21:57.275
Can I make an announcement
to pe-- everybody?

21:57.359 --> 21:59.069
Basically, we're on drugs,

21:59.152 --> 22:02.114
and it would help us
if nobody looked at us.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.408
Oh! Margaret?

22:05.492 --> 22:06.493
Margaret.

22:07.119 --> 22:09.246
- Oh, my God, it's Margaret.
- Do you know that woman?

22:10.747 --> 22:12.875
Oh, my God.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.960
This is my nanny from when I was...

22:15.043 --> 22:16.044
Margaret?

22:23.093 --> 22:25.512
I'm just more comfortable
with somebody I know.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.932
I just feel more comfortable
with her right now.

22:29.016 --> 22:32.644
-This is Margaret, she's my nanny.
-Andy. Who are we going to meet?

22:32.727 --> 22:33.728
Roger.

22:33.811 --> 22:37.274
He's a cute guy
that works at a... at a sake bar.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.152
And... But he, uh...
If anybody asks, he's my cousin.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.653
-Okay.
-He's my cousin.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.947
My kissing cousin.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.825
'Cause we kiss each other...

22:47.910 --> 22:49.036
on the privates.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.665
Is that funny?
You're making me paranoid.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.833
Where are we getting off this train?

22:55.918 --> 22:58.336
DTLA. That's...

22:58.420 --> 22:59.879
Do you know what that stands for?

22:59.963 --> 23:01.048
-Yeah.
-What?

23:01.131 --> 23:04.301
-Downtown Los Angeles.
-Town El Os Angellel...

23:04.384 --> 23:06.094
-Valley!
-Mmm, yes.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.346
-What?
-Valley.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.933
Oh, she's saying we're having a valley,
'cause the drugs.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.809
The drugs give you peaks and valleys.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.020
No, she's saying
we're going to the Valley.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.480
We got on the wrong train.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.274
I told you! I told you
that we had to get on the Blue Line.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.858
That's not my job!

23:20.943 --> 23:25.113
I told you, I told you, I told you!
You're such a stupid, stupid bitch.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.075
- She's talking to you.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.024
Oh, my God, we're still going.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.275
Where?

24:04.069 --> 24:05.820
My eyes are so dry.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.991
We're gonna be there soon, I know it.
Uh, this-- You know what? I'm sober.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.368
This is taking so long, I'm...
Why did we do this?

24:11.451 --> 24:15.038
This is insane. I thought the LA subway
was eight blocks long.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.664
I'm over it.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.957
Over it.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.335
I wanna be home.
I wanna be in bed.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.796
My stomach hurts,
my eyes are dry as fuck.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.923
No!
No, Andy, Andy. Andy.

24:26.008 --> 24:28.010
Oh, my God,
that's like Clockwork Orange.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.512
- Oh, God, that feels so good.
- Oh, shit...

24:30.595 --> 24:33.765
Oh, God. I swear to God,
I thought my eyes were like raisins.

24:35.683 --> 24:38.061
I don't know what kind of
deal with the devil you've made,

24:38.145 --> 24:39.521
but we know what we saw.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.314
If I thought you had
the courage to tell anyone,

24:41.398 --> 24:42.732
I might actually be afraid.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.859
We must deny these accusations.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.903
- Okay, okay, hold it there.
- That's a cut.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.572
Yeah!
Great take.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.740
Good job.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.866
I think that was the one, right?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.076
Heidi, I actually...
Can I talk to you--

24:53.160 --> 24:54.244
- That was rehearsal.
- Yeah.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.412
Yep, sorry.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.748
Um... I think it's great.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.832
-Mmm-hmm.
-Um, this, uh...

24:59.916 --> 25:03.920
"We must deny these accusations"
line is just, it's not working for me.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.256
-Calm down.
-Okay. Cool, it's cool.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.843
Sorry I'm not jaded.

25:13.638 --> 25:14.639
Okay, did you get that?

25:14.722 --> 25:17.684
You're gonna go right into your line
after her line.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.519
Her line's been cut.
She's not gonna say anything there.

25:19.602 --> 25:20.937
- Not at all.
- I could do something.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.731
No, no, no. It's fine.
Just go right back to your mark there.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.528
We're wasting time now.

25:28.611 --> 25:29.904
Just cut it now. It's fine.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.823
Yeah, I just did.

25:32.365 --> 25:37.495
Have you ever been punched in the face
so hard that you shit your pants?

25:39.331 --> 25:41.040
-No.
-I have.

25:41.124 --> 25:42.417
What happened?

25:42.500 --> 25:45.628
I met these two black girls

25:45.712 --> 25:49.841
and we went down to, like, South Central.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.260
I went in their car.
They picked up another guy.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.636
We kept going.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.349
And then I got punched in the face...

25:57.432 --> 25:58.808
the side of my face,

25:58.891 --> 26:03.771
so hard that... I shit my pants.

26:06.233 --> 26:10.027
Every-- Every bad choice
I've made, it's drinking.

26:10.112 --> 26:12.864
Everything I've lost, drinking.

26:12.947 --> 26:16.159
I got that Vince Vaughn movie.
I was right there.

26:16.243 --> 26:19.579
I thought he was sober and we went out,
and he's not.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.414
-Mmm-hmm.
-And we drank.

26:21.498 --> 26:25.460
And then I... I blacked out,
but I know it wasn't good.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.044
I probably got gropey.

26:27.129 --> 26:29.547
I don't want to do this anymore.

26:29.631 --> 26:33.218
God, I was doing good!
You know, I had 14 months.

26:34.136 --> 26:37.139
It just so sucks
when you gotta reset that app.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.515
Do you have one of those apps?

26:38.598 --> 26:39.807
Oh, the sobriety app?

26:39.891 --> 26:41.393
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

26:41.476 --> 26:45.980
I got scared.
This dude's, like, nice and...

26:46.063 --> 26:49.609
funny, and sweet, and...

26:49.692 --> 26:51.944
I'm just, like, this piece of shit.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.322
And I just wanted to save him from me.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.409
But that's bullshit,
I was just scared.

26:58.410 --> 27:02.372
Well... we'll just reset our apps.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.456
- You know?

27:11.839 --> 27:13.758
It's-- It's gonna be okay.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.555
Maybe we didn't do enough sassafras.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.270
Hey, Evan, how are we doing
on time right now?

27:25.353 --> 27:28.105
Gus, not now. Those kids got
plenty of trailer time today.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.899
No, I just-- I meant-- Uh...

27:29.982 --> 27:31.734
Like, when are we getting out of here?

27:31.818 --> 27:33.820
That dude's a dick, man.
Don't even worry about him.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.614
Yeah, I don't know.
How did I go wrong with Mickey, you know?

27:36.698 --> 27:37.699
Is she mad at me?

27:37.782 --> 27:40.452
It's like I feel like I lost her somehow,
and I don't know why.

27:40.535 --> 27:42.662
Dude, I don't even know
where the left turn came, man.

27:42.745 --> 27:46.123
I would say at the beginning of this day,
you had a 90% chance of getting pussy.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.084
I thought it was gonna rain pussy
on you tonight.

27:48.167 --> 27:52.214
Now it's more like 100% chance of me,
like, jacking off.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.965
-Yes. That is for sure, man.
-Yeah.

27:54.048 --> 27:56.634
Well, thank you for the real talk.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.135
I appreciate it, seriously.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.012
No problem, Gus.
Stop texting that girl.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.098
Okay. I'm done.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.395
-He doesn't know what anything looks like.
-I know

28:07.479 --> 28:09.146
Look at this monologue.

28:09.231 --> 28:10.815
It's, like, a whole page of text.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.024
- That's ridiculous.
- I was like,

28:12.108 --> 28:13.360
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

28:15.987 --> 28:17.154
-Hey, hey.
-Hey.

28:17.239 --> 28:18.573
Could I talk to you for just a second?

28:18.656 --> 28:19.699
Yeah, what's up?

28:19.782 --> 28:23.035
So you know how you said, um, if they cut
one of my lines, I should worry?

28:23.119 --> 28:25.413
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well, they just cut my first line,

28:25.497 --> 28:28.541
-so, like, I guess I'm off the show.
-Oh! That sucks.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.626
I know.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.129
You know what? Fuck that.
Fuck these guys.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.381
-I know.
-You know?

28:34.464 --> 28:35.507
Fuck these guys.

28:35.590 --> 28:36.674
Do you wanna make an impression?

28:36.758 --> 28:38.468
Yeah, I-- Yeah.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.263
Mmm. You should do something big.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.389
Like-- Wait, what?

28:42.472 --> 28:43.473
-Yeah.
-Like?

28:43.556 --> 28:45.057
I mean, that's, like,
all anybody talks about here,

28:45.141 --> 28:46.309
is, like, doing something big.

28:46.393 --> 28:47.602
You know, Susan says that all the time.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.980
She's like, "Every three pages
something huge should happen," you know?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.064
Oh, okay.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.025
So, you should do that.
Like, in your scene.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.277
-Just do something.
-Okay.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.112
-You know, improv something.
-Okay, you think that's gonna work?

28:58.195 --> 28:59.196
-Yeah!
-Okay.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.032
I mean, why wouldn't it, right?
What do you got to lose?

29:01.115 --> 29:02.992
- Yeah, I mean...
- Just say, "Fuck it!"

29:03.075 --> 29:04.076
-Okay.
-Go ballistic.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.037
-Yeah, fuck it. Okay.
-Just go crazy.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.121
-All right. Yeah!
-You know?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.331
-I could do that.
-Just throw it out there.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.458
-Just throw it in their faces.
-Okay.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.126
-Okay.
-Will do!

29:12.209 --> 29:15.046
Okay. In their faces--
Okay. Okay.

29:17.507 --> 29:19.426
Could you not hover?

29:19.509 --> 29:20.510
-Oh, I'm sorry. Am I?
-Yeah.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.594
You gotta give us, like,
three feet, dude.

29:21.678 --> 29:22.679
I can hear you
breathing in my ear.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.763
It's really fucking distracting.

29:23.846 --> 29:24.847
This isn't a bus.
How about over here?

29:24.931 --> 29:25.932
I'm watching. I just--
I like the show.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.016
Let's watch from right over here, please.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.518
-Okay. All right.
-Thank you.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.602
Okay, call it.

29:29.686 --> 29:31.313
And... action!

29:31.896 --> 29:33.856
I don't know what kind of deal
with the devil you made,

29:33.940 --> 29:35.567
but we know what we saw!

29:35.650 --> 29:37.777
If I believed you actually had the courage
to tell someone,

29:37.860 --> 29:39.446
then I might actually be afraid.

29:39.529 --> 29:42.949
Ain't no regular girl able to kill a man
like that with her own mind.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.992
I think you two is witches.

29:45.076 --> 29:49.456
You have no idea who we are!

29:50.748 --> 29:51.916
What the fuck?

29:51.999 --> 29:54.919
And I'm pregnant!

29:55.002 --> 29:56.003
Hold it! Jesus!

29:56.087 --> 29:57.839
Cut, cut, cut!
And hold positions.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.131
Nobody move.
We have broken glass.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.216
Are you guys okay?

30:00.300 --> 30:01.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.385
I'm so sorry. I just--
I thought maybe

30:02.469 --> 30:04.429
we should do something, like,
a little bigger that time.

30:04.512 --> 30:05.930
It's okay.
That was cool.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.557
Okay, let's get this
cleaned up carefully.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.058
- You guys cannot move.
- Okay.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.728
Obviously she can't be that big,
but, uh...

30:11.811 --> 30:13.438
-Yeah.
-...that kind of played, right?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.398
Yeah, I like that character going dark.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.317
-Actually, it works for us.
-Right.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.693
You know where we could use her?

30:18.776 --> 30:20.820
We could use her
in the graveyard scene with Arya.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.572
-Oh, yeah. That makes sense.
-Yeah.

30:22.655 --> 30:23.865
It does.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.199
-Yeah, she can't be pregnant, though.
-Yeah.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.785
Yeah, no. Fuck that.
She ain't pregnant.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.662
Oh, fuck.
You know what?

30:29.746 --> 30:32.582
She could be the one
to light the school on fire in the finale.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.167
I like that.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.337
Uh, Heidi. Um...

30:37.420 --> 30:38.421
That was really unprofessional.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.756
-I'm so sorry.
-Okay, don't ever do that again.

30:39.839 --> 30:40.840
I will not-- I--

30:40.923 --> 30:41.966
-Ever.
-Ever.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.510
-Okay? You lost your mind there a bit.
-Okay.

30:43.593 --> 30:46.429
But we need you to do it one more time,
just so we have it clean and wide.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.140
-Yeah, you got it. Mmm-hmm.
-Okay. Back to one, witches!

30:50.266 --> 30:52.018
Can we get playback here,
on this monitor?

30:52.101 --> 30:53.227
Get playback
in monitor D, please.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.854
So we know
what the fuck we're doing, please.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.939
It's supposed to be
the biggest turkey drumsticks

30:57.023 --> 30:58.400
of any Renaissance festival
around here, so--

30:58.483 --> 30:59.484
- Wow.
- It should be fun.

30:59.567 --> 31:00.568
I don't know if you're--
But anyway,

31:00.652 --> 31:02.612
they are thinking about
adding you to the call sheet tomorrow,

31:02.695 --> 31:04.656
so, if you could be on stand-by,
that would be great.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.115
-Sure! Thank you.
-Cool.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.117
-Hopefully we'll see you soon.
-Yeah, have a good night.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.412
- Hey!
- Hi! Oh, my...

31:10.495 --> 31:12.997
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God, thank you.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.666
- Yeah! No, of course.

31:14.749 --> 31:15.833
I'm glad it worked out.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.835
-Yeah.
-And that you didn't kill anybody.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.295
- I know! I know!

31:19.379 --> 31:21.255
-Yay, me!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.339
Oh, wow.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.758
-Um... Yeah.
-That was amazing.

31:23.841 --> 31:27.637
I think, um, they're actually talking
about adding me to another episode.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.932
-Oh, wow! That's cool.
-I think. It's so crazy.

31:31.015 --> 31:33.059
Um, do you wanna get a drink?

31:33.142 --> 31:36.604
Um... Uh, I actually already have plans...

31:36.688 --> 31:38.355
-Oh, okay.
-...for tonight.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.692
- Oh! Okay.
- So, yeah... No, no, no.

31:40.775 --> 31:42.402
-It's so late. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah, uh...

31:42.485 --> 31:43.945
Couldn't-- Can't flake out.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.947
I guess I'll see you, uh,
the next time I shoot?

31:46.030 --> 31:48.032
Yes! That's right.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.951
-Yeah, definitely. Definitely, okay.
-Same time, same place.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.744
-Well, probably a different time.
-All right.

31:51.828 --> 31:52.995
You know that.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.247
-Okay.
-All right. Gotta run. Okay.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.002
Dude, I'm, like, really glad that we met.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.254
But I am never doing this again.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.716
Well, I might.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.427
Um, what about meetings?

32:07.510 --> 32:08.553
What meetings do you go to?

32:08.636 --> 32:11.222
I usually go to that one
in the church on Hillhurst.

32:12.849 --> 32:17.770
There's one tomorrow at, uh, the YMCA.
Sunset and Alvarado.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.063
You wanna meet there?
Noon. Tomorrow.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.356
-Yeah, I could do that.
-You wanna meet there?

32:20.440 --> 32:21.483
-Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah?

32:21.566 --> 32:23.192
Jesus, what the fuck do I do now?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.987
Just get an Uber.
Go home and go to sleep.

32:26.070 --> 32:28.030
No, I--

32:28.114 --> 32:29.156
Okay.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.242
Hey, how 'bout, uh...
you want to share an Uber and...

32:33.745 --> 32:35.538
...come to my place, crash out?

32:37.624 --> 32:40.877
How about we share an Uber,
and go to your place, crash out?

32:40.960 --> 32:41.961
It's not gonna happen.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.379
No, I'm not saying it's gonna,
I'm just-- Okay.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.339
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, you got reception finally?

32:45.422 --> 32:46.423
Look at all these texts.

32:46.508 --> 32:48.009
What-- Who is it?
Can I get a ride?

32:48.092 --> 32:49.426
That dude, Gus.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.346
- Maybe he can give us a ride.

33:07.361 --> 33:08.655
I really did have a good time.

33:08.738 --> 33:09.739
- Me, too.
- Okay.

33:09.822 --> 33:10.865
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.033
Yeah. Thanks, baby.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.826
- Bye!
- Bye!

33:42.647 --> 33:45.357
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm so sorry about everything.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.568
No, I'm sorry.

33:46.651 --> 33:49.904
Like, I was in this bar,
and I had no reception,

33:49.987 --> 33:52.574
and I'm just now walking home.

33:52.657 --> 33:54.491
No, no, no.
It's cool.

33:54.576 --> 33:56.994
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I felt like I was the one who was...

33:58.204 --> 33:59.205
fucking up.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.833
I guess we're both fuck-ups.
So it's cool.

34:01.916 --> 34:05.587
If you do wanna try this again--
You don't have to, but I do, uh...

34:05.670 --> 34:08.590
Maybe we should pick an earlier time,
like 7:00?

34:08.673 --> 34:13.177
Oh, 7:00? That's not, um... that's not
too proper for you or anything, or...

34:14.345 --> 34:15.930
Fuck it, I mean, I'll do 6:00.

34:16.013 --> 34:19.308
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, I'll do 5:00.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.102
Hey, make it 4:00, bitch!

34:21.185 --> 34:24.146
Uh, yeah, let's do 4:00 then.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.774
-All right. Good night, Gus.
-Bye.
