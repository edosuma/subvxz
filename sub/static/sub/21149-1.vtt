WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:11.881
Oh, how cute!
You're so cute!

00:13.491 --> 00:14.903
Hey.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.515
Hi. I need three iced lattes
and a regular coffee.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.907
Oh, and extra straws, please!

00:18.931 --> 00:20.561
Right.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.694
Oh!

00:22.718 --> 00:26.002
Put some ice on that, Stan,
and ibuprofen for the pain.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.959
Thanks, Doc.
Yeah.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.788
Hi, Levon! Got you a fix.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.208
One more here...

00:34.730 --> 00:35.837
Oh, hi!

00:35.861 --> 00:37.796
Maddy, I did not
forget about you.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.884
Thanks, honey.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.755
And can you help
with one more problem?

00:40.779 --> 00:42.129
Sure.
Thank you.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.847
What's the prognosis?

00:45.871 --> 00:47.023
Oh...

00:47.047 --> 00:50.417
Well, orchids need
less sunlight, not more.

00:50.441 --> 00:51.505
Here, I'll take care of it.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.941
I'll get it back to you
next week.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.595
Dex and I are going
to that wedding this weekend.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.206
Oh, and how are things with Dex?

00:56.230 --> 00:57.816
Well, last night at dinner,

00:57.840 --> 00:59.948
he asked for
my social security number.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.429
How... Romantic?

01:02.453 --> 01:03.996
I think he wants to add me
to his retirement account.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.084
Or running a credit check?

01:05.108 --> 01:06.781
Either way, it's forward motion.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.392
Still hasn't popped
the question, huh?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.481
No, no, but
I've dropped a few hints.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.091
And, you know, Dex,

01:12.115 --> 01:14.789
he can get really distracted
when the stocks are down,

01:14.813 --> 01:17.227
so I'm just praying
for a bull market.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.490
Tess, you already missed
your 'ring by spring' goal.

01:19.514 --> 01:22.145
Well, Australia's spring
is in September.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.450
And what's going
to happen with Dex

01:23.474 --> 01:25.235
when you get that fellowship
at Northwestern?

01:25.259 --> 01:26.671
I don't have the fellowship yet,

01:26.695 --> 01:28.194
and, you know,

01:28.218 --> 01:30.762
it's tricky with Dex because
he loves Boston so much.

01:30.786 --> 01:31.937
I don't want to spook him.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.852
Sounds like
he needs to be spooked

01:33.876 --> 01:35.462
to appreciate
what he's got in you.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.812
Don't worry. I have a plan.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.838
And you've
got a patient.Oh.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.861
Hi, Sam!

01:42.885 --> 01:45.453
I hear you're making
a miraculous recovery.

01:47.890 --> 01:48.910
Hello!

01:48.934 --> 01:50.695
I am Dr. Harper,
and you are...

01:50.719 --> 01:52.914
Nervous.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.873
Look, Doctor, uh,
before you give me that shot,

01:54.897 --> 01:56.744
I've got to tell you,
I've got a phobia of needles.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.137
So, um...
Mmm-hmm.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.791
Can you do me a favor
and just, uh,

01:59.815 --> 02:01.358
could you just hold this for me,

02:01.382 --> 02:02.794
and just, um, just be careful

02:02.818 --> 02:04.926
because it's really,
you know, fragile.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.406
But I was scarred
when I was a kid.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.626
Um, I had a shot, and...

02:08.650 --> 02:09.975
Just messed me up.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.455
Be careful!

02:11.479 --> 02:14.177
Okay, as I was saying,
um, I'm a real...

02:16.571 --> 02:18.138
Was that the shot?

02:19.051 --> 02:21.247
That wasn't bad at all.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.944
Rule number one,

02:22.968 --> 02:24.622
always keep the patient
distracted.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.755
Good job.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.941 --> 02:41.746
Amber! How's the bride-to-be?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.791
Good! I'm excited!

02:43.815 --> 02:46.229
I'm going to send you a link
to the Commodore Club.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.535
It's amazing.
It's right on the lake.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.015
There's a golf course and a spa,

02:50.039 --> 02:51.669
and everybody
in the wedding party

02:51.693 --> 02:53.410
gets their own bungalow.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.933
Well, you've always lived large.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.848
Why would your wedding
be any different?

02:56.872 --> 02:58.415
Anyway, I cannot wait.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.981
Hey, how are you holding up?

03:00.005 --> 03:01.287
Oh...

03:01.311 --> 03:02.810
Did I tell you
I'm rethinking the flowers?

03:02.834 --> 03:03.942
Again?

03:03.966 --> 03:05.596
What is wrong
with the Delphinium?

03:05.620 --> 03:07.424
Well, I just... I realized
that they're going to clash

03:07.448 --> 03:08.686
with the bridesmaids' dresses!

03:08.710 --> 03:10.601
Okay, okay,

03:10.625 --> 03:13.386
remember the advice I gave you about
your prom dress in high school?

03:13.410 --> 03:14.779
Close your eyes.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.433
Shut out the world.

03:16.457 --> 03:20.001
Now imagine, what color do you
see coming down the aisle?

03:20.025 --> 03:22.178
The pink bridesmaids' dresses...

03:22.202 --> 03:24.571
And pink does go with blue.

03:24.595 --> 03:28.009
So... yeah, I'm going
to stick with the Delphinium.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.098
Oh, Tessie,
what would I do without you?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.883
Nothing,
'cause I'll be there soon,

03:31.907 --> 03:32.927
and I cannot wait!

03:32.951 --> 03:34.494
Does the same go for Dex?

03:34.518 --> 03:35.408
Absolutely!

03:35.432 --> 03:36.583
We are having dinner tonight

03:36.607 --> 03:38.368
to go over all the travel plans.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.481
Yay!
Yay!

03:44.659 --> 03:47.551
Hey. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.683
I stopped by to get that
charger that you asked for,

03:49.707 --> 03:51.903
and then I popped by home
so that I could change, and...

03:51.927 --> 03:53.513
You look sensational.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.558
Thank you.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.386
Let's get a table.
I am starving.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.344
Oh, hon, there's actually just
someone I want you to meet first.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.737
Oh, but I've been
juggling patients all day.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.260
I haven't had anything to eat.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.131
Absolutely.
What was I thinking?

04:03.155 --> 04:04.461
Holbrooke can wait.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.202
Mr. Holbrooke?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.313
Your new boss? Yeah, I
just bumped into him here.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.618
I promised him you'd say hello.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.141
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.298
It's good.
We should say hi.Great.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.584
Mr. Holbrooke.
Dex.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.673
I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Dr.
Tess Harper.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.544
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.937
She's on staff
at Bayside General,

04:25.961 --> 04:27.634
and still somehow
manages to find time

04:27.658 --> 04:29.332
to head the fundraiser
for Harborwalk.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.159
Really?
That's very impressive.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.552
Oh, my life is easy.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.709
Dex works 10 times
harder than I do.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.602
Well, Dex, if you pick
your stocks

04:38.626 --> 04:40.952
the same way you pick
your girlfriend,

04:40.976 --> 04:42.910
you've got a great
future ahead of you.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.912
Have a nice dinner.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.895
See you, Mr. Holbrooke.
Take care, Dex.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.378
Thank you.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.229
Thanks. You were
perfect back there.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.752
Thanks for talking me up
to Holbrooke.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.627
Oh, enough work-talk
for one night?

05:03.651 --> 05:05.759
Of course.

05:05.783 --> 05:09.937
Amber's wedding is finally going
to give us a chance to relax.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.505
I already booked our flights.
Um, day after tomorrow.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.072
I got us aisle seats.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.682
We have barbecues, golf...

05:15.706 --> 05:17.510
I already booked us
massages at the spa.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.120
Right.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.905
Oh, and guess what? Someone
from the selection committee

05:20.929 --> 05:22.559
for the fellowship
is going to be there.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.169
He's a friend of Amber's dad!

05:24.193 --> 05:26.040
That's great!
Yeah.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.260
Yeah, I thought the wedding would
be a great place to talk to him,

05:28.284 --> 05:30.262
and, you know,
for us to scope out...

05:30.286 --> 05:32.438
Chicago? Again?

05:32.462 --> 05:34.875
It's two hours
from where I grew up.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.834
Plus, I could see my mom more,

05:36.858 --> 05:38.401
and your firm
has an office there.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.751
You could put in
for that transfer. I know, I know.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.796
I just, I need
to wrap my brain around this.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.321
Oh, come on. It's Chi-town!

05:45.345 --> 05:47.714
The Windy City! Wrigley Field!

05:47.738 --> 05:49.934
I prefer Fenway Park.
Agree to disagree.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.239
Okay.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.589
Tess, what do you need
Chicago for?

05:52.613 --> 05:54.504
You've got everything
you need right here.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.071
But Northwestern is
a leader in innovation.

05:57.095 --> 06:01.075
At Bayside, we have to fight
over digital thermometers.

06:01.099 --> 06:05.210
And, yes, there is a lot to
love about this city, but...

06:05.234 --> 06:07.038
Tess, let's just get through
this week

06:07.062 --> 06:08.977
before planning
the rest of our lives.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.042
Okay.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.697
But in the meantime,
pack those golf shoes,

06:13.721 --> 06:16.439
'cause we are going
to have a blast.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.594
Okay.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.445
So you've known
each other how long?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.882
Oh, Amber and I
went to grade school,

06:24.906 --> 06:27.580
and then all the way
through college together.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.843
Yeah, it was always Amber's
job to get in trouble,

06:29.867 --> 06:32.324
and it was my job
to come in and fix it.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.021
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah!

06:34.045 --> 06:35.632
Like, when Amber
was learning to drive,

06:35.656 --> 06:38.199
and she hit a mailbox,
I took the fall.

06:38.223 --> 06:41.725
When she, like, flooded
the dorm with bubble bath,

06:41.749 --> 06:43.901
I was the one
who found the mops.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.729
I would even go on
double-dates with her

06:45.753 --> 06:47.774
and laugh at her jokes
just so they didn't bomb.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.819
Typical Tess.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.908
But when I get to Chicago,

06:50.932 --> 06:53.519
I am going to relax
and have fun.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.130
You, relaxing?
What does that look like?

06:56.154 --> 06:57.610
Very funny.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.221
I can relax. I can chill.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.614
Chillax.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.789
Cool my jets.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.139
Well, when you get
that fellowship at...

07:05.163 --> 07:07.490
If I get that fellowship.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.254
It is still a long shot.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.232
Plus, you know,

07:11.256 --> 07:13.844
I have a really nice life here.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.672
Is that you talking, or Dex?

07:15.696 --> 07:18.414
Okay, you got me,
but I'm telling you,

07:18.438 --> 07:22.896
after four days in that warm wedding
glow, at that amazing resort,

07:22.920 --> 07:24.855
Dex is going to fall
in love with Chicago,

07:24.879 --> 07:26.552
he's going to propose to me,

07:26.576 --> 07:28.859
and practically insist
that I take that fellowship!

07:28.883 --> 07:29.971
And if he doesn't?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.999
Knock-knock!

07:39.023 --> 07:42.220
I have our seats and our boarding
passes for this weekend.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.657
I am sorry, Tess.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.963
There's been a hitch.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.355
Holbrooke came down
to my office,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.140
and he said he wants
to talk about my future,

07:49.164 --> 07:50.489
this weekend.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.709
He invited me to go yachting!

07:52.733 --> 07:55.320
But, Dex, we're going to
Amber's wedding this weekend!

07:55.344 --> 07:56.495
I know, sweetie,

07:56.519 --> 07:58.018
but it's such
a great opportunity.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.456
But we can't miss the wedding!

08:00.480 --> 08:03.328
This is...
This is terrible timing.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.417
What do you want me to do?

08:05.441 --> 08:07.941
Well, come with me!
To the wedding!

08:07.965 --> 08:11.118
It will mean so much to Amber,
and it's going to be a blast.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.380
I mean, it's going to be awkward

08:12.404 --> 08:13.580
telling Holbrooke
I'm going to back out.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.167
You already told
Holbrooke 'yes'?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.169
It was spur of the moment.
I wasn't thinking.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.455
Oh...

08:20.412 --> 08:23.043
Wow.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.394
Well, I mean, I guess
you can't back out now.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.831
It just...

08:27.855 --> 08:29.857
This really changes my plans.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.356
Your plans?

08:31.380 --> 08:34.272
Huh? Oh, uh, you know, just,

08:34.296 --> 08:37.057
celebrating... The wedding.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.495
Sweetheart,
I'll make it up to you.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.366
Okay.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.654
Well, it's not going
to be the same without you.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.003
Trust me.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.298
Hey! What's up?

09:00.322 --> 09:01.429
Hey, Tess!

09:01.453 --> 09:02.648
Why aren't you at the airport?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.258
Ah, in a few hours.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.043
Yes, I'm leaving soon.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.914
Where's Dex?

09:07.938 --> 09:11.222
Um, well, actually, it's just
going to be me for the wedding.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.137
Dex can't make it.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.399
What?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.923
Yeah, he had
a work situation come up.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.273
I can't believe it!

09:19.297 --> 09:21.275
Calm down, Amber.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.842
You're the one
who should be upset!

09:22.866 --> 09:25.758
Well, you know how busy Dex
is, and this is just a...

09:25.782 --> 09:28.108
Quit making excuses.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.763
I mean, not only is
he missing my wedding,

09:30.787 --> 09:31.938
he's leaving you high and dry.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.766
Nonsense. I will be fine.

09:33.790 --> 09:34.811
I am fine.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.029
Fine.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.291
What time does your flight land?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.858
At 3:00.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.426
I'm heading to the airport now, and...
Oh, shoot.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.123
What's wrong?
I just...

09:43.147 --> 09:44.908
I realized that the rental
car's in Dex's name.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.126
Oh, don't worry.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.389
I'll arrange someone
to pick you up.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.546
Oh, no, you don't have
to do that, truly.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.265
Hello, Amber?

09:54.289 --> 09:55.701
Amber, hello, are you there?

09:55.725 --> 09:56.963
I lost you.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.444
Uh, yep, still here.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.533
Think my WiFi's on the fritz.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.536
What? Not again.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.146
Oh, are you okay?

10:06.170 --> 10:09.193
The wedding planner and I have
been clashing over napkin rings.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.977
I've got to go, honey.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.326
Get here soon, okay?

10:12.350 --> 10:13.545
I am on my way.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.092
See you soon.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.745
Hi! I'm Tess Harper.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.138
Yeah, Michael.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.836
Got any bags? Oh, just a few.
I travel light.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.383
Okay, great.
Yeah.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.321
Whew!

10:50.345 --> 10:52.497
Wow. This is
traveling light, is it?

10:52.521 --> 10:55.761
Well, it's a four-day wedding.
I need a lot of outfits.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.807
Oh, oh, please be
careful with that one!

10:57.831 --> 10:59.417
Oh, and that one, too.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.853
Why, what you got in here?

11:00.877 --> 11:03.116
Um, well, shoes.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.534
A lot of shoes.
That's a lot of shoes.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.948
Yeah...
Okay.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.602
You know what, you can just
hop in if you want.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.777
I'll get you there real quick.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.171
I know Chicago
like the back of my hand.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.782
Why don't you have a sticker?
A what now?

11:16.806 --> 11:20.699
A sticker? You know,
the... Ride-share sticker?

11:20.723 --> 11:22.832
Oh, a sticker? Yeah...

11:22.856 --> 11:26.574
Yeah, they don't give them
to all of us, so...

11:26.598 --> 11:29.273
Are you sure you don't want to
ride up in the front with me?

11:29.297 --> 11:32.015
I'm good.
Yeah. Okay.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.127
'Cause I'm not a chauffeur.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.826
I'm the best man.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.352
Oh!

11:41.744 --> 11:42.634
Front?

11:42.658 --> 11:43.679
Yeah.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.810
Doc.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.203
That was a dirty trick
you just played.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.334
Trick?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.012
You're the one
who made the assumption.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.430
And you had the chauffeur sign.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.042
Amber said, 'Go to the airport
and pick up Tess.'

11:59.066 --> 12:01.566
She's getting super stressy
with the wedding flowers,

12:01.590 --> 12:04.264
and I was more than happy
to get out of that insanity.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.963
She's stressed already,
and it's day one.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.268
Poor Amber.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.401
That's the problem
with weddings.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.969
Oh, you have a lot of
experience with weddings, huh?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.101
Yeah, you could say that.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.452
So are you opposed to all
weddings, or just this one?

12:18.476 --> 12:21.412
You know, I do love the perks,
though, the golf and the music,

12:21.436 --> 12:22.848
and the fun,

12:22.872 --> 12:25.808
but the stress and the traditions?
Not so much.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.592
But you've got it all backwards.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.073
Weddings are not
about the perks.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.359
It's about the people!

12:32.839 --> 12:34.642
You want to know the truth?

12:34.666 --> 12:37.428
Weddings are only fun
if they're not your own.

12:37.452 --> 12:40.300
Wow, I really hope that is
not your wedding speech.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.935
You know what?
That's a really good idea.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.871
I hope
you're not expecting a tip.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.010
Can you turn that down, please?

12:54.034 --> 12:57.491
What? You don't like
Chicago's best blues?

12:57.515 --> 13:00.016
Well, I like my eardrums more,

13:00.040 --> 13:02.975
and at over 80 decibels,
it can trigger tinnitus.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.977
Tinni-whoda-what-now?

13:05.001 --> 13:08.981
It's a medical term for a, you know,
buzzing sound or ringing in the ears

13:09.005 --> 13:11.810
from exposure to loud music,
your loud music.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.900
Fine. Okay. Your loss.
Thank you.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.598
Could you just take it a little
slower around these curves?

13:17.622 --> 13:21.037
I'm going to really need
that massage tomorrow.

13:21.061 --> 13:24.257
Yeah, you need to relax.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.955
Are you sure
this is the right way?

13:25.979 --> 13:28.044
Are you kidding me?
I grew up around here.

13:28.068 --> 13:31.874
I'm like a human map
of the Greater Chicago area.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.180
What's the use?
Right?

13:34.204 --> 13:37.183
Stop your grousing and just
enjoy this beautiful scenery.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.230
And you're positive we didn't take
a wrong turn somewhere, or...

13:40.254 --> 13:44.562
Trust me. The Commodore
Club is just up ahead here.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.479
So you and Amber, you've known
each other a long time, huh?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.066
Yeah. Yeah.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.850
We've known each other
our whole lives.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.634
It's actually funny
going to her wedding,

13:53.658 --> 13:56.637
'cause when we were young, we used
to marry our stuffed animals.

13:56.661 --> 14:00.554
I remember one time, a teddy bear and
a sheep made the perfect couple.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.842
Until one of them realized
he was a carnivore.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.646
Way to ruin the memory.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.954
Don't blame me. That's just
how nature works itself out.

14:08.978 --> 14:12.001
Um... Are we here? Can we...

14:12.025 --> 14:14.220
You know, I can walk, actually.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.743
I could just get out and walk.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.267
You want to get out? Yeah, I could.
I mean, are we...

14:17.291 --> 14:19.747
I guess we could stand each
other for a few more seconds.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.271
The Commodore Club
is right up here.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.818
Not a moment too soon.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.724
...interesting.

14:39.748 --> 14:43.883
Yeah. Well, thank you
for picking me up.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.166
It was an interesting ride.

14:47.190 --> 14:50.822
No problem. I hope you weren't
serious about that no-tip thing?

14:50.846 --> 14:52.084
Oh.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.086
Well, here's a tip.
Always wear sunblock.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.784
Gee, thanks.

14:56.808 --> 15:01.050
So what do you do when you're not
picking people up from the airport?

15:01.074 --> 15:03.400
I'm a lawyer.
Ah, well, that explains

15:03.424 --> 15:05.750
why you weren't so forthcoming
about who you are.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.057
A divorce lawyer at a wedding

15:08.081 --> 15:09.841
is like bringing
a baby to the movie theaters.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.191
You get a lot of dirty looks.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.696
Mmm. Or maybe it's just you.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.370
Ouch.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.198
So which way is Amber?

15:19.222 --> 15:22.810
There's a group gathering
out on the club patio.

15:22.834 --> 15:26.162
So I'm just going to run this
over to your bungalow.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.554
Thank you.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.426
You sure you're all right
with that little one?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.645
Oh... Really?

15:31.669 --> 15:34.213
Oh, thank you so much.
I was joking.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.520
No, that's so nice of you.
I'm going to take it.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.522
Uh, which way? This way?
That way?

15:38.546 --> 15:40.306
No, that's,
that's where the reception is,

15:40.330 --> 15:43.266
so you're going to probably
want to check in first.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.920
Oh, no, no, no,
there's no time for that.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.965
I'm already running late, and
Amber has a tendency to freak...

15:46.989 --> 15:48.077
Tess!

15:48.643 --> 15:49.774
Out.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.101
Hi!

15:52.125 --> 15:53.754
I'm so glad you're finally here!

15:53.778 --> 15:55.626
Oh, my gosh, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.565
Where do I start?

15:58.218 --> 15:59.151
The cake is gone.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.718
The wedding planner quit,

16:00.742 --> 16:03.503
and my wedding vows, they just,
they read like a ransom note,

16:03.527 --> 16:05.027
and there's a million
things that I...

16:05.051 --> 16:06.158
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.073
I'm here, okay? Just breathe.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.229
Okay.
I've got this.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.076
Okay?
Okay.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.643
Good. All right.
Go back inside.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.210
I'll be in there
in just a sec. I'll see you out there.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.626
Okay.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.225
Thanks for coming.
Yeah, all right.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.791
Jack!

16:30.815 --> 16:32.968
How you doing?
Tessie! You made it!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.360
Any groom jitters?
Are you kidding?

16:34.384 --> 16:36.449
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.929
Right answer.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.670
Oh, I think my uncle just
discovered it's an open bar.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.150
I'd better go
keep an eye on him.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.935
Tess!
Hi, Bernadette!

16:43.959 --> 16:46.198
Wow, I haven't seen you since
our, what, our college reunion?

16:46.222 --> 16:48.984
Can you believe it?
Us, bridesmaids! Ahhh!

16:49.008 --> 16:50.531
Yeah. Ahhh!

16:51.401 --> 16:53.423
Oh, mother of the bride alert.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.207
Tess. Hi, dear.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.122
How lovely to see you.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.689
Where's that handsome
boyfriend of yours?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.996
Oh, well, he had to stay
behind in Boston for work.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.171
What?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.955
His loss.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.566
Uh-oh, here comes Aunt Millie.

17:06.589 --> 17:09.289
Batten down the hatches.
You know what she's like.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.920
Oh, my, aren't you pretty?

17:12.944 --> 17:16.402
You know, there are a lot of
eligible young men at this wedding.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.298
Oh, uh, truly, no need.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.189
Mr. Tilton!

17:20.213 --> 17:21.406
Oh, she's so adorable!

17:21.431 --> 17:23.409
Tess, dear! You made it.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.932
How are you holding up?

17:24.955 --> 17:26.151
Oh, smooth sailing.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.872
Never better!
Oh!

17:28.830 --> 17:29.937
Frankly, Tess, I'm terrified.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.200
It's as if Amber and her mother

17:31.224 --> 17:32.810
are speaking some kind of,
I don't know,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.333
foreign language, Wedding-ese.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.813
I mean, they ask me questions,

17:35.837 --> 17:37.858
but I sense I'm not supposed
to say anything,

17:37.882 --> 17:39.686
so do I answer, or don't I?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.384
It'll all be over soon.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.019
Uh-huh, and quite likely,
I will be, too.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.631
Amber!

17:48.023 --> 17:49.261
Whoa.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.568
Okay, I like mimosas
as much as the next gal,

17:51.592 --> 17:54.571
but at the rate you're going, they're going
to run out of orange juice in Florida!

17:54.595 --> 17:56.573
Bernadette keeps
telling me a story

17:56.597 --> 17:59.078
about a bride who can't fit
into her wedding dress!

17:59.904 --> 18:01.012
So...

18:01.036 --> 18:02.231
Isn't it obvious?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.841
She's trying
to get into my head!

18:03.865 --> 18:06.583
Oh. Oh, no. I'm sure she's
just trying to be funny.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.479
You look beautiful...
And nervous.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.329
Oh, honey, honey,

18:13.353 --> 18:15.374
did you connect
with the steakhouse yet?

18:15.398 --> 18:17.333
Jack's friend is catering
the reception dinner.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.465
Charlie's got
all the orders A-okay.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.424
Best steaks in town.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.427
And you didn't forget
the seven vegan meals, right?

18:24.451 --> 18:25.993
The vegans are cool.
It's all handled.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.386
And you're gonna help
your mom with the slide show?

18:27.410 --> 18:30.128
Amber, on it. Relax, okay?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.564
Take care of her.
Yeah.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.044
Okay? See you.

18:33.068 --> 18:36.221
Jack is as cool as a cucumber,
and I am falling apart.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.832
Ever since the wedding planner
left, everything is a mess!

18:38.856 --> 18:41.008
Oh, relax. I'm sure
everything can be handled

18:41.032 --> 18:42.401
with a few phone calls.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.317
What is this I hear
about an AWOL wedding cake?

18:45.341 --> 18:47.798
The baker was supposed
to check in days ago,

18:47.822 --> 18:50.583
and this is a very special wedding
cake that I designed myself,

18:50.607 --> 18:53.499
with meringue hearts,
there's a custom topper,

18:53.523 --> 18:55.458
and 'Love Forever'
written in marzipan.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.547
Do you have
a number for this bakery?

18:57.571 --> 19:01.116
It's somewhere in the
wedding planner's notes.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.293
All right.
I am calling them right now.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.425
Oh, thank you, Tess.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.992
I knew you would help. Our
bakery is permanently closed

19:08.016 --> 19:09.776
at this location...
Oh.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.432
Well, uh, there's a reason you
haven't heard from the bakery.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.391
The recording says
they're closed.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.329
For the day?

19:16.981 --> 19:18.307
For forever.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.700
Gone out of business.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.921
But... But they
have Daddy's deposit!

19:23.945 --> 19:25.531
Oh, this is not good.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.752
See, the wedding planner is
supposed to be handling this.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.015
Yeah, what exactly happened
with the wedding planner?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.886
She was super-opinionated.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.845
Isn't that why you hire one?

19:34.869 --> 19:37.891
Yeah... But, I mean,
we were clashing from day one.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.633
And then we got in the teeniest
little tiff over place-settings,

19:40.657 --> 19:42.287
and she just quit!

19:42.311 --> 19:45.290
Okay, well, it sounds like you
need a new bakery, and fast.

19:45.314 --> 19:48.511
Would you?
Oh, Tess, you are the best!

19:48.535 --> 19:50.624
Oh, uh, well, I'm...

19:52.365 --> 19:54.908
Yeah, you know,
I made it through med school.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.475
Think I can handle a cake.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.130
Oh, but you will need a driver.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.199
Huh?
Michael!

20:00.764 --> 20:01.698
Oh, no.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.135
Oh, yeah, no, I'm fine.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.833
Tess, I'm not going to
trust you to some Chicago cabbie.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.183
Michael!
Yeah, me?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.923
Yeah, no, I'm...
I'm good.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.970
Yeah, she's good,
whatever it is!

20:12.994 --> 20:15.146
Tess, Michael is from Chicago,

20:15.170 --> 20:18.260
and you wouldn't mind driving Tess to
some bakeries, would you, Michael?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.108
Uh...

20:21.132 --> 20:24.503
Jack just rented this boat, and we're
going to go fishing on the lake,

20:24.527 --> 20:26.026
and all the groomsmen are going.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.724
Yes, please, go!

20:27.748 --> 20:29.726
Yeah, I wouldn't want to get
between you and a fish.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.206
Okay, guys!

20:31.230 --> 20:35.427
As maid of honor and best man,
it is your duty to help.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.342
Right, okay.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.170
Of course.
Of course.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.433
Yeah, and Michael
will help, right?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.043
Right! Fine.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.958
You guys are the best.

20:44.982 --> 20:47.222
Thanks!

20:47.246 --> 20:51.138
Okay, so, well, I'm going
to start googling bakeries,

20:51.162 --> 20:54.011
and you go pull the car around.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.534
Okay, fine.

20:55.558 --> 20:59.059
Just remember, I'm a lawyer.
I'm not a chauffeur.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.759
Okay, well,
maybe you could make a motion

21:02.783 --> 21:04.175
toward the parking lot?

21:04.828 --> 21:05.805
Very funny.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.527
I thought so.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.857
Can you move
a little quicker, please?

21:13.881 --> 21:16.381
I'm supposed to be fishing,
not on some crazy cake hunt.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.253
Oh, you're not the only
one making sacrifices.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.777
I had to move my shiatsu
massage until tomorrow.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.910
Besides, helping a wedding
is a noble cause.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.521
Who made you wedding planner?

21:25.545 --> 21:27.653
Everyone knows when you
lose a wedding planner,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.264
there is a clear line
of succession,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.353
starting with the maid of
honor and the best man,

21:31.377 --> 21:33.355
all the way down
to the flower girl.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.139
Okay, none of that is true.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.054
Do you honestly want to trust crazy
Aunt Millie with the wedding?

21:37.078 --> 21:39.099
Purple scarf?

21:39.123 --> 21:41.363
No, but I don't understand why you and
I have to be roped into this thing!

21:41.387 --> 21:43.147
Well, Jack is your
best friend, right?

21:43.171 --> 21:44.279
Yeah.
Amber's mine,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.715
so let's just steer this wedding

21:45.739 --> 21:47.325
clear of the icebergs, okay?

21:47.349 --> 21:48.785
Oh...

21:50.134 --> 21:52.025
Oh, for cracking ice!
Look at this.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.332
Jack's cousin just caught a trout.
The lucky stiff.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.116
Oh, stop your bellyaching.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.337
I am saving you from
sunburn and sea sickness.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.947
Great bedside manners, Doc.

22:00.971 --> 22:04.908
Oh, here it is! I have a great
feeling about this place.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.781
I'm not quite sure I follow.
Can you run that by me again?

22:08.805 --> 22:11.697
Well, for a wedding cake,
we'll simply make four layers,

22:11.721 --> 22:14.028
and then we'll nix the
lollipops and keep the bow!

22:15.290 --> 22:16.422
Right...
Right!

22:19.903 --> 22:21.490
Oh, wow.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.733
Can we get a dozen of these?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.605
Eleven to go?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.409
Oh!

22:27.433 --> 22:29.173
Ah...
Sorry.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.744
So, you need
a wedding cake ASAP?

22:36.050 --> 22:37.941
Have you two
thought this through?

22:37.965 --> 22:40.552
What? Yes!
No! No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.162
It's not for us.

22:42.186 --> 22:43.338
This is what the bride wants.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.494
'She' does, huh?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.518
Quite the list.
Can you do it?

22:49.542 --> 22:52.347
Of course. We are the
best bakery in the city.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.524
And that is why
we came to you first.

22:55.548 --> 22:58.507
Why don't you have a look
around, and I'll total this up.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.798
These cakes are the perfect
metaphor for a wedding.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.756
Treacle syrup,
assortment of nuts,

23:10.780 --> 23:13.193
and just as expensive
as a small house.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.631
Why are you so cynical
about weddings?

23:15.655 --> 23:17.328
Weddings are wonderful!

23:17.352 --> 23:19.852
I don't understand why people would
want to spend a small fortune

23:19.876 --> 23:22.705
on something that fails
55% of the time.

23:25.578 --> 23:28.383
When Amber and I
were little girls,

23:28.407 --> 23:32.343
we snuck under a hedge and watched
my neighbor's backyard wedding.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.040
It was magical.

23:34.064 --> 23:37.130
You know, what's magical is how
a nest egg can just disappear.

23:37.154 --> 23:40.177
Trust me, in my line,
I have seen couples

23:40.201 --> 23:42.527
where that money should've been
spent on couples' counseling,

23:42.551 --> 23:43.659
not on a wedding.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.488
I'm starting
to see it now. What?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.838
Yeah, I'm a doctor, and I
completely missed the symptoms.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.406
This is personal,
all of this wedding-bashing.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.711
Wedding bashing?

23:52.735 --> 23:54.583
The wedding still on, you two?

23:54.607 --> 23:56.106
Wow.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.368
That's ridiculous!

23:57.392 --> 23:59.326
So is your timeline.

23:59.350 --> 24:02.678
I don't suppose you would consider
knocking that price down for us

24:02.702 --> 24:04.244
just a little bit, do you?

24:04.268 --> 24:06.682
I really like your bakery,

24:06.706 --> 24:08.771
and I could put a good word in
with the mayor.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.425
He's getting married
in the spring.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.905
You know the mayor? Yeah,
I got him on speed-dial.

24:12.929 --> 24:15.454
We went to law school together,
and I helped him pass ethics.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.302
I'll see what I can do.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.283
Thank you.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.698
Ethics?

24:22.722 --> 24:24.288
Ethics, yeah.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.795
I've got to say, I was
super impressed with you today.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.927
Fighting to get a better price
on that cake.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.539
Maybe change your
opinion about weddings?

24:37.563 --> 24:40.324
No, I just couldn't bear
to see you steamrolled.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.567
Yep, still you.

24:42.437 --> 24:43.482
Tell me you got a cake?

24:45.875 --> 24:46.852
Oh, no.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.375
Victory!

24:48.399 --> 24:51.030
You guys, thank you so much!

24:51.054 --> 24:53.642
Oh, you two make a great team.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.646
Like orange juice
and toothpaste.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.169
Still you.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.997
But see? Doesn't it
make you feel good,

25:01.021 --> 25:02.588
seeing her that happy?

25:03.110 --> 25:05.044
Yeah, totally.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.394
Okay, that was so not heartfelt.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.441
By the way,
good job playing backup today.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.964
So you're saying
I'm like your nurse?

25:11.988 --> 25:13.792
Oh, no, I would never say that.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.403
Nurses are heroic
and devoted to their work.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.841
And I'll be leaving now.
See you at the ceremony.

25:18.865 --> 25:19.929
Not a moment sooner.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.258
Works for me.

25:24.697 --> 25:25.848
Hey!
Howdy.

25:25.872 --> 25:26.655
How's it going, bud?

25:27.221 --> 25:28.807
Hi.
Hi.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.984
So... what's his deal anyway?

25:32.008 --> 25:33.508
Michael?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.075
He's Jack's college roommate.
They go way back.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.729
He's cute, huh?

25:37.753 --> 25:39.644
Oh, well... Whatever.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.907
I mean, he certainly thinks
very highly of himself.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.388
Well, you've got good hair,
so he makes up for it.

25:44.412 --> 25:47.870
Well, all I know is, you guys are
rock stars for getting that cake,

25:47.894 --> 25:50.481
and I'm sorry I've been
so stressed this week.

25:50.505 --> 25:55.399
Well, rule number one. Always keep
a stressed patient distracted.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.619
So what do you think about a
round of golf in the morning?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.316
You're on.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.061
Welcome, all.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.584
I just want to thank everyone

26:06.608 --> 26:09.544
for joining us here
for this very happy occasion.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.285
Now, everybody,
go find your bungalows,

26:12.309 --> 26:16.899
because we've got four days of fun
and festivities to look forward to.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.901
Cheers!

26:18.925 --> 26:19.858
How was that?

26:19.882 --> 26:21.338
Very well done.

26:21.362 --> 26:24.471
Nice. I know!
It's happening!

26:24.495 --> 26:26.454
You've
reached Dex. You know what to do.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.477
Hey, Dex.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.698
I was just calling
to let you know I got in okay,

26:33.722 --> 26:36.396
and that I miss you.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.616
Wish you were here.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.077
You would really love
this place.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.037
Okay. Bye.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.063
Isn't this great?

26:51.087 --> 26:54.545
Getting out, getting some
fresh air, some exercise,

26:54.569 --> 26:56.155
getting your mind off of the...

26:56.179 --> 26:57.983
The wedding?
Yeah.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.029
Yeah, this is
a good stress reliever,

27:00.053 --> 27:01.620
and I clearly needed it.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.862
So... Jack's
been acting strangely.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.254
How so?

27:08.278 --> 27:09.908
Last night, I wanted
to go over the seating chart,

27:09.932 --> 27:12.302
and he was absolutely nowhere
to be found.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.347
I mean, I just...
I don't get it.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.567
He's usually so reliable.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.004
Do you think this is
a sign of things to come?

27:19.028 --> 27:21.050
I'm sure
it's just a case of nerves.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.268
Yeah...

27:22.292 --> 27:23.922
Oh, speaking of nerves,

27:23.946 --> 27:26.316
would you like
to write my wedding vows?

27:26.340 --> 27:29.493
Hah! Your fifth-grade paper
on pilgrims is one thing,

27:29.517 --> 27:31.930
your wedding vows,
that's something else.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.671
But I did get an 'A'
on that paper.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.045
Yeah, and ironically,
I turned mine in late.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.241
Hey, you know what?

27:38.265 --> 27:40.373
Let's go lose ourselves
in some waffles.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.506
Yeah, uh...

27:42.530 --> 27:43.855
Oh, darn.

27:43.879 --> 27:47.424
Oh, that's my Aunt Karen
from the airport.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.252
Her flight
keeps getting bumped. Oh, no.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.862
You go ahead.
I'll meet you there.

27:50.886 --> 27:51.713
Okay.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.914
Beautiful place, Mr. Tilton.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.263
Yes.

28:00.287 --> 28:03.135
It puts the 'pretty'
in 'costs a pretty penny.'

28:03.159 --> 28:05.877
Well, hopefully,
when it's all said and done,

28:05.901 --> 28:07.120
it will be worthwhile.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.621
You're here alone, aren't you?

28:10.645 --> 28:11.970
Yes.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.493
You don't bring a date
to a wedding

28:13.517 --> 28:15.452
unless you're pretty serious.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.672
Well, I met my wife
at a wedding.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.350
You know, there are a lot of
very attractive bridesmaids.

28:20.829 --> 28:21.980
Pass.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.876
I'm very happy
being single right now.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.487
Famous last words.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.231
You turn a corner and bump
into a certain someone,

28:32.232 --> 28:33.470
and all bets are off.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.061
Fickle finger of fate.

28:37.063 --> 28:40.196
I love the alliteration,
but... Not gonna happen.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.218
Let me guess.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.220
You took one on the chin
and you never recovered.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.222
Failed romantic becomes a cynic.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.921
I think you're forgetting
what I do for a living.

28:49.945 --> 28:53.055
Every marriage begins
with the best of intentions.

28:53.079 --> 28:56.275
I think this conversation's getting a
little heavy for the putting green.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.843
Yeah. I think you're right.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.280
Jack and Amber
are meant for each other,

29:01.304 --> 29:03.239
so none of this applies to them.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.893
I'll see you
at the buffet brunch?

29:04.917 --> 29:06.068
Oh, yeah.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.723
I've been starving
myself all morning.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.879
Don't forget. We've got
a 2:00 tee time.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.752
Wouldn't miss it.

29:25.589 --> 29:26.958
What's up with the name tags?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.786
Oh, it's a game

29:28.810 --> 29:30.701
to help guests
get to know each other!

29:30.725 --> 29:33.356
You get the name tag with
the name of a famous person

29:33.380 --> 29:34.923
put on your back...

29:34.947 --> 29:36.838
And then you get somebody
to help you guess who you are.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.318
So, Tess, any clues who I am?

29:39.342 --> 29:41.668
Oh, uh,
you dropped out of Harvard

29:41.692 --> 29:43.627
and became one of the
richest men in the world.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.107
Oh, I wish.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.586
Then I could afford
this wedding.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.719
Henry, you promised.

29:48.743 --> 29:51.461
Tess, dear, make sure you
get something to eat.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.898
Oh, and any hints?
Who am I?

29:53.922 --> 29:55.595
Oh, you like to solve mysteries.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.120
Think British.
It's elementary.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.643
Sherlock Holmes?
Right you are.

29:59.667 --> 30:00.905
Oh, perfect.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.515
Now maybe I can solve
the mystery

30:02.539 --> 30:03.952
of that missing boyfriend.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.302
Abandoning
a pretty girl like you?

30:06.326 --> 30:09.590
Oh, wow, I'd better hurry.
They're almost out of waffles.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.636
Mildred?

30:13.376 --> 30:14.876
Enjoying the perks?

30:14.900 --> 30:17.008
Got about a day's worth of
calories on that plate.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.576
Yep, um, I'm carb-loading.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.361
I've got 18 holes of golf out
there with my name on them,

30:22.385 --> 30:23.972
right after brunch.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.104
Here, help me
figure out who I am. Hmm?

30:26.128 --> 30:27.845
Oh, you're immature.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.935
You enjoy winning
and giving orders.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.677
Ah... Napoleon?

30:33.701 --> 30:35.331
Oh, you're talking
about the game?

30:35.355 --> 30:37.550
Come on,
tell me who I am. You're Peter Pan.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.335
Ah. All right.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.032
You are a woman,

30:41.056 --> 30:43.513
you led an army,
and you're a martyr.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.080
Joan of Arc.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.603
Very fitting.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.040
Old friend?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.607
No, that's Dr. Hastings.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.305
He's the head of the medical
board at Northwestern.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.656
I have never met him,
but I certainly would like to.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.963
Well, here's your big chance.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.878
I just don't know
what I would say.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.576
I mean, you could start
with something like 'hello.'

31:03.600 --> 31:04.471
Yeah?

31:05.864 --> 31:06.971
Okay, here he comes.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.649
Here he comes.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.757
No...

31:10.781 --> 31:13.586
And there he goes.

31:13.610 --> 31:14.979
I am getting paged.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.416
What, by a patient?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.703
No, by the bride.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.924
Ah...

31:27.842 --> 31:29.776
Hi.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.889
I just talked to my Aunt Karen and
she's not going to be here on time...

31:32.238 --> 31:34.085
Can you do help?
Can you do it?

31:34.109 --> 31:35.632
Yeah.
Thanks.

31:37.069 --> 31:40.072
Put down that bacon.
We've got a task.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.614
Again?

31:41.638 --> 31:43.902
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.187
And you think
I am happy about this?

31:49.211 --> 31:51.929
Amber's Aunt Karen was supposed to
do something big for the wedding,

31:51.953 --> 31:53.365
and she missed her flight.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.064
Yeah, but I have a tee time,
and I'm going golfing,

31:56.088 --> 31:58.631
and you should be getting your
massage that you scheduled.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.851
But the bride needs
her something-blue.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.765
What is that?

32:01.789 --> 32:03.375
'Something old, something new,

32:03.399 --> 32:05.334
'something borrowed,
something blue?'

32:05.358 --> 32:06.988
Right, but what
is the 'something?'

32:07.012 --> 32:08.424
I don't know yet!

32:08.448 --> 32:10.121
You know what?

32:10.145 --> 32:12.297
You just go play golf, but just
answer me this before you go

32:12.321 --> 32:14.212
since you know this city
like the back of your hand.

32:14.236 --> 32:18.695
Is there, like, a really good
vintage accessories place?

32:18.719 --> 32:19.546
What?

32:20.416 --> 32:21.437
In English?

32:21.461 --> 32:23.656
Like, an antique jewelry store.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.006
Oh.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.379
Um...

32:27.597 --> 32:29.358
I might... Know a place.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.621
Okay, great. Thank you.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.908
Let's go.
We don't have time. You're going to starve!

32:38.391 --> 32:40.978
I'm taking my bacon.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.719
It's a perfect day for golf.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.634
Oh, quit sulking.

32:44.658 --> 32:47.419
Anyway, helping people
is its own reward,

32:47.443 --> 32:49.769
and besides, as maid of honor
and best man, it is our...

32:49.793 --> 32:51.597
Sacred duty. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

32:51.621 --> 32:54.513
but Jack Nicklaus just designed
this golf course back there, so...

32:54.537 --> 32:56.689
And look,
I loved him in Chinatown,

32:56.713 --> 32:59.431
but can we please get this dog
and pony show on the road?

32:59.455 --> 33:00.911
Okay, wait, what?

33:00.935 --> 33:02.608
Where did that expression
come from? Do you know?

33:02.632 --> 33:06.482
Well, obviously, the dog
needed a sophisticated touch,

33:06.506 --> 33:08.136
so they added a pony.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.226
No, no, no, the pony needed
to appeal to the masses,

33:11.250 --> 33:12.531
so they added the dog.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.403
Is everything an argument
with you?

33:14.427 --> 33:16.535
Wow, you really are a lawyer.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.015
Can we go, please?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.930
Can you put down that...
I don't...

33:19.954 --> 33:21.105
Hold it.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.367
Ugh.
Okay, I'll hold it.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.784
Yeah, thank you.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.122
Oh, I hate to say it,

33:38.146 --> 33:40.298
but this place looks perfect.

33:40.322 --> 33:41.647
Let's head inside.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.649
Look, I think I'm just
going to wait out here.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.216
I don't want to go in, so...

33:45.240 --> 33:47.436
It's a jewelry store,
not a haunted house.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.288
Come on, help me
pick something out.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.211
Ah, look!

34:00.342 --> 34:01.667
Something blue.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.060
All done. Let's go.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.453
Um, a keychain?

34:04.477 --> 34:07.325
Yep. I mean, look at that.

34:07.349 --> 34:10.806
To unlock the secrets of each
other's hearts. It's poetic.

34:10.831 --> 34:15.029
Okay, Amber is not going to pin a
keychain to her wedding dress.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.837
How do you even know
about this place?

34:17.793 --> 34:20.730
I... I just do.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.732
Fine, be mysterious.

34:22.755 --> 34:25.126
Oh, look at that!

34:25.150 --> 34:26.518
Oh, yeah, that's perfect.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.129
Can we go now?

34:28.152 --> 34:30.609
Oh, you know what? No. Amber
was swarmed by dragonflies

34:30.632 --> 34:31.610
when she was young.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.829
She still has flashbacks.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.268
Yes!

34:37.292 --> 34:39.641
Mmm, that... Is perfect.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.038
Really is.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.301
What are you staring at?

34:46.822 --> 34:47.868
Hmm?

34:49.739 --> 34:52.196
Oh, nothing.

34:52.219 --> 34:56.070
It's just
that it matches your eyes.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.246
Oh, you know what?
I think it's a little...

34:58.270 --> 34:59.377
I think it's a little flashy.

34:59.401 --> 35:00.987
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

35:01.011 --> 35:03.207
Listen, why do you even
ask for my opinion

35:03.231 --> 35:04.730
if you're just going
to ignore it?

35:04.754 --> 35:06.471
Oh, 'cause
when it comes to weddings,

35:06.495 --> 35:08.212
you have everything backwards.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.543
I ask for your opinion,
so then I can do the opposite.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.739
That's ridiculous.

35:13.763 --> 35:16.090
Okay, something blue...
Honestly!

35:16.114 --> 35:18.701
That is exactly
what is wrong with weddings.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.920
The traditions, the pitfalls.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.054
They turn what is supposed
to be some great party

35:24.078 --> 35:26.709
into one big buffet of stress.

35:26.733 --> 35:30.234
You just don't get it, because
a big event like this for you,

35:30.258 --> 35:31.888
all you have to do
are the three S's.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.107
Ah, the three S's.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.958
Yeah, shower,
shave, and show up.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.242
That is not how I remember it.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.376
But the bride
is under so much pressure.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.293
She's got the planning,
the organizing, the budgeting,

35:45.317 --> 35:47.817
and then also, like,
the juggling of family,

35:47.841 --> 35:50.602
and old friends
from college, even exes,

35:50.626 --> 35:53.953
all the while trying to
look gorgeous in a dress.

35:53.977 --> 35:57.131
Wow. You have really put
some thought into this.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.873
I'm just saying, most of the heavy
lifting falls on the bride's shoulders,

36:00.897 --> 36:02.919
so cut Amber some slack.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.094
Uh-huh.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.052
Amber has been
in Chicago long enough.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.837
She can handle it.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.404
They don't call us the City of
Broad Shoulders for nothing.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.145
Yeah, what does that even mean?

36:11.169 --> 36:14.017
You know, it's the line in the
Carl Sandburg poem 'Chicago, '

36:14.041 --> 36:15.888
and it means we work hard here,

36:15.912 --> 36:17.412
and even if that work
isn't pretty,

36:17.436 --> 36:19.283
and even if it hurts,

36:19.307 --> 36:22.025
Chicago people push through.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.356
We do what we have to do
to get things done.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.814
What?

36:28.838 --> 36:32.688
Oh, uh, just
actually sounded poetic.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.037
Thank you.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.019
Is something wrong with you?

36:38.283 --> 36:40.739
And it's how I know that your
boyfriend is not from Chicago.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.045
And how's that?

36:42.069 --> 36:43.307
Because he doesn't
do the heavy lifting,

36:43.331 --> 36:44.961
like flying here for a wedding.

36:44.985 --> 36:45.986
That is really ugly.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.922
Then it must be perfect.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.707
Thank you.
You're welcome.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.472
Oh.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.711
Again?

36:55.735 --> 36:57.626
I've got to take this.
Yep. No problem.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.193
Hi.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.237
Who were
you talking to back there?

37:00.261 --> 37:02.413
Oh, that was Michael.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.806
Yeah, we're out shopping
for jewelry.

37:03.830 --> 37:04.763
Who?

37:04.787 --> 37:06.374
Michael. He's the best man.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.984
Yeah, we're just helping
Amber out.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.333
You know, the bride,
she needs her something...

37:09.357 --> 37:11.248
Hey, Tessie, I need your help.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.032
How soon do I need to take
that sea sickness medication

37:13.056 --> 37:14.773
before yachting
to be absolutely positive?

37:14.797 --> 37:16.732
Oh, just a couple of hours.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.560
Got it. Thanks! Hey, look,

37:18.584 --> 37:20.518
I've got to run, babe.
I'll call you later. Well, how...

37:20.542 --> 37:21.650
Miss you. Bye.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.110
Okay, bye.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.248
Everything okay?

37:31.031 --> 37:32.313
Boyfriend troubles?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.184
Everything's fine.
Thank you for caring.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.751
Oh, I have to pay for the...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.318
I already took care of it.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.691
It's for a noble cause.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.652
You're welcome.

37:45.524 --> 37:48.590
They're probably
around the twelfth hole by now.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.419
Don't you feel some
deep sense of satisfaction,

37:51.443 --> 37:54.073
playing such a role
in someone else's happiness?

37:54.097 --> 37:55.901
No, I feel a deep void

37:55.925 --> 37:57.860
where the golf would have gone.

37:57.884 --> 37:58.861
Are we done?

37:58.885 --> 38:00.166
Yes, thank goodness.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.820
So you can go
join your friends.Yes.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.996
And I finally get to relax, too.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.129
Ah, now you're
starting to get it.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.478
Tess!
Huh?

38:07.502 --> 38:10.089
We're headed to the spa,
and you're coming.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.308
Finally.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.005
Tess?

38:13.029 --> 38:14.703
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.555
Now, you know
about computers, right?

38:17.817 --> 38:20.361
Sure. Why do you ask?

38:20.385 --> 38:23.189
Well, it's the slideshow
for the rehearsal dinner.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.931
Jack was supposed to help me,
but I can't find him anywhere,

38:25.955 --> 38:28.064
and I'm in way over my head.

38:28.088 --> 38:31.091
Tess, but you're
due at the spa right now.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.026
I... I can help.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.245
Oh!

38:35.269 --> 38:37.837
Thank you, honey.
Bye, Michael!

38:39.055 --> 38:40.381
Now, you'll have time
to get to it... Bye.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.320
...before the barbecue
meet and greet.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.388
Thank you, Tess.

38:47.412 --> 38:50.260
You and Michael
have been such lifesavers.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.957
So, what do you,
what do you think of him?

38:51.981 --> 38:53.481
Oh, he's like a foggy X-ray.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.873
I can't figure him out.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.658
Hey, hon, I'm going
to head back to the kitchen,

38:56.682 --> 38:58.834
and grab some more marshmallows
and stuff for the s'mores, okay?

38:58.858 --> 39:00.381
We need 'em.

39:02.122 --> 39:05.362
And there he goes again,
the amazing vanishing groom.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.885
Stop worrying.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.235
There's mountains
of marshmallows.

39:09.259 --> 39:13.152
He just keeps making excuses
so that he can disappear.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.372
He was AWOL for hours today.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.592
He was probably
with his groomsmen.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.767
No, no!

39:18.791 --> 39:21.030
The groomsmen were at the gym.
Not Jack.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.338
Oh, God, Tess, what if I'm
making a huge mistake?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.382
What do you mean?

39:25.406 --> 39:27.123
Well, I love Jack,

39:27.147 --> 39:29.647
but we are very
different people sometimes.

39:29.671 --> 39:32.433
I am a morning person.
He's a night owl.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.522
Jack loves the beach.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.045
I hide from the sun.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.699
I mean, I love to dance.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.658
I think Jack would rather be
tortured than dance.

39:40.682 --> 39:42.399
Okay, Amber,

39:42.423 --> 39:45.620
do you remember the first day of
college when your keys went missing,

39:45.644 --> 39:47.622
and you thought for sure
your roommate had stolen them,

39:47.646 --> 39:49.493
and the whole time,
they were in your nightstand,

39:49.517 --> 39:51.452
and everything was fine?

39:51.476 --> 39:52.366
Yeah.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.671
You are a worrier.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.828
It's just what you do.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.569
I know.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.375
And you know
the best thing for cold feet?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.898
No.
Circulation!

40:02.922 --> 40:04.856
Oh. So go get that
party started.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.685
Please, go move
those feet.Okay.

40:07.709 --> 40:08.686
Doctor's orders.

40:08.710 --> 40:09.842
I'm going.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.215
Uh-oh.

40:16.239 --> 40:18.043
What kind of a greeting is that?

40:18.067 --> 40:20.524
Well, you know,
every time I see you,

40:20.548 --> 40:23.266
we get dragged
into some kind of a task.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.224
That's actually true.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.313
How was the rest of your day?

40:27.337 --> 40:29.490
It was great actually, yeah.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.883
Finally got
that round of golf in.

40:31.907 --> 40:35.713
And I'm really sorry you got
roped into that presentation.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.236
I tried to help you.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.369
And thank you for trying,

40:39.393 --> 40:41.284
but what choice did I have?

40:41.308 --> 40:43.721
I mean, no one was
lifting a finger,

40:43.745 --> 40:45.201
and Mrs. Tilton
gave me the photo album,

40:45.225 --> 40:47.769
and there was a scanner
in the business center.

40:47.793 --> 40:51.990
Well... At least you get
to enjoy all of this.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.427
Looks like it's going
to be a beautiful night.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.691
This sunset, the fire coming,

40:56.715 --> 40:58.456
and your laptop.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.307
Wow! Okay.

41:04.331 --> 41:09.704
For such an organized person, I did not
expect to see such a cluttered desktop.

41:09.728 --> 41:10.835
That's impressive.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.881
'Innovations
in Bone Density Scanners'?

41:12.905 --> 41:15.013
'Advances
in Podiatry Treatments'?

41:15.037 --> 41:16.841
I like to be cutting-edge.

41:16.865 --> 41:20.410
I have, like, 50 medical papers
to read, in my fun-time.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.238
Promise not to invite me
to your fun-time.

41:22.262 --> 41:24.090
Oh, I promise.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.334
A hundred seconds of solitude?

41:31.358 --> 41:32.509
Hmm?

41:32.533 --> 41:33.815
What? Oh.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.425
Yeah, of course.
What was I thinking?

41:35.449 --> 41:38.104
Had to check on the florist.
No stone unturned.

41:39.235 --> 41:42.519
Hey, Tess?
Can I make an observation?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.608
In the 48 hours
that I've known you,

41:44.632 --> 41:46.436
you pass up a golf game,

41:46.460 --> 41:48.482
you've eaten only
when forced to,

41:48.506 --> 41:51.963
and you missed a spa day so that you
could work on a slideshow presentation.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.400
And your point?

41:54.424 --> 41:56.968
My point is, all these guests
here, they're having a blast.

41:56.992 --> 41:59.101
When are you going to join in?

41:59.125 --> 42:02.147
Well, it just seems like
people keep needing my help.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.758
That's because you let them.

42:03.782 --> 42:06.021
Ever heard the phrase,
'Doctor, heal thyself'?

42:06.045 --> 42:08.850
Look, there is a silver lining
to me being busy this weekend,

42:08.874 --> 42:11.766
and that is that
it takes the focus off of me.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.985
I swear, if Bernadette asks me
where my 'missing boyfriend' is

42:14.009 --> 42:16.510
one more time,
I am going to snap.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.033
And where is your
missing boyfriend?

42:18.057 --> 42:19.904
Ha. Very funny.

42:19.928 --> 42:21.253
Thank you.

42:21.277 --> 42:22.603
I just have to survive
yoga with her tomorrow,

42:22.627 --> 42:24.953
and then I can have some peace.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.824
Oh, carb-loading again?

42:26.848 --> 42:29.435
Last two skewers on the barbie,

42:29.459 --> 42:31.220
and one's got your name on it.

42:31.244 --> 42:32.830
Don't confuse me by being nice.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.876
Fine, I'll eat 'em.
No, I'll...

42:35.901 --> 42:37.226
What? What is it?

42:37.250 --> 42:39.184
It's Dr. Hastings again.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.969
Oh, yeah, the
guy from the brunch.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.492
What is his deal, anyway?

42:42.516 --> 42:44.712
I'm up for this fellowship
at Northwestern,

42:44.736 --> 42:47.105
and he is
on the selection committee.

42:47.129 --> 42:49.020
Ah, so... Go say hi.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.979
Hmm? No, no, no.

42:51.003 --> 42:53.614
Well, he's having dessert,
you know, so... Uh-huh.

42:55.007 --> 42:57.681
Okay, so, if you get
the fellowship,

42:57.705 --> 43:00.075
does that mean
you're moving to Chicago?

43:00.099 --> 43:01.859
Oh, um, I don't know.

43:01.883 --> 43:04.035
It's complicated.

43:04.059 --> 43:06.385
Ah, the boyfriend
doesn't like Chicago.

43:06.409 --> 43:09.519
Oh, you just think you have
everyone's number, don't you?

43:09.543 --> 43:11.521
Yeah. I can't help it.

43:11.545 --> 43:13.784
After years and years
of patterns,

43:13.808 --> 43:14.916
they just start to form.

43:14.940 --> 43:17.179
Like, for example...

43:17.203 --> 43:18.789
See those two right there?
Yeah?

43:18.813 --> 43:21.139
He just met Jack's cousin
and she really likes him,

43:21.163 --> 43:23.533
but she doesn't know
how he feels about her.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.709
Well, how does
he feel about her?

43:25.733 --> 43:30.608
Well... I know it looks like he's wondering
if his kebabs are overcooked, right?

43:31.347 --> 43:33.567
But... He likes her.

43:34.350 --> 43:36.415
He likes her a lot.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.417
Wow!
Yeah.

43:38.441 --> 43:40.768
Good work. I'm impressed.

43:40.792 --> 43:41.769
Thanks.

43:41.793 --> 43:43.553
Yeah, you know, in my line,

43:43.577 --> 43:45.381
you get so you can just glance

43:45.405 --> 43:47.775
and understand
people's love lives.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.472
All right. All right.

43:49.496 --> 43:51.648
You're using
your professional skills.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.955
I'm going to use mine.

43:53.979 --> 43:56.958
The patient's acute cynicism

43:56.982 --> 44:00.831
suggests a build-up
of antibodies to weddings,

44:00.855 --> 44:03.138
perhaps from a prior trauma?

44:03.162 --> 44:04.685
Oh, wait, let me guess,

44:05.468 --> 44:07.185
commitment-phobic?

44:07.209 --> 44:10.101
No. I mean, yes...

44:10.125 --> 44:11.581
Okay, a couple,
two or three years ago,

44:11.605 --> 44:13.583
I was engaged... Emily...

44:13.607 --> 44:15.803
And I just went with the flow,

44:15.827 --> 44:19.110
sunk a ton of money into a
big wedding that she wanted.

44:19.134 --> 44:20.634
You know, the whole hoopla,

44:20.658 --> 44:23.985
the string quartet,
and the... Doves.

44:24.009 --> 44:25.639
You?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.075
Did not see that one coming.

44:27.099 --> 44:28.598
Yeah, I was all in,

44:28.622 --> 44:30.774
everything
but the break-dancing bears.

44:30.798 --> 44:32.036
Oh.

44:32.060 --> 44:34.299
Then, three months
before our wedding,

44:34.323 --> 44:36.780
she met somebody else,

44:36.804 --> 44:39.740
and at a wedding, ironically.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.437
Ouch.

44:41.461 --> 44:44.396
Yeah, and then, you know,
the jewelry store today...

44:44.420 --> 44:45.746
No! Don't tell me.

44:45.770 --> 44:48.183
That's not
where you got the ring!

44:48.207 --> 44:49.575
And where I returned it.

44:49.599 --> 44:51.253
Oh, Michael...

44:51.906 --> 44:53.492
Wow.

44:53.516 --> 44:55.214
I'm really sorry.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.845
It's in the past.

44:57.869 --> 44:59.653
Yeah.
Right?

45:00.088 --> 45:02.197
Yeah! Hey.

45:02.221 --> 45:03.546
To Jack and Amber.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.634
To Jack and Amber.

45:04.658 --> 45:06.312
The last two skewers.

45:08.314 --> 45:11.728
You know, I actually studied
to practice environmental law.

45:11.752 --> 45:13.469
So, why divorce law?

45:13.493 --> 45:15.558
I don't know,
I just kind of fell into it.

45:15.582 --> 45:16.820
I took a couple cases
at the beginning,

45:16.844 --> 45:19.344
and turned out
I was really good at it.

45:19.368 --> 45:22.826
You know, we both work
in fields that involve pain.

45:22.850 --> 45:25.220
My specialty is making it
quick and painless,

45:25.244 --> 45:27.265
but I'd like
to switch fields some day.

45:27.289 --> 45:28.963
So why don't you
put out some feelers

45:28.987 --> 45:30.921
to law firms you actually
want to work with?

45:30.945 --> 45:33.097
You know, you could...
Tess, stop.

45:33.121 --> 45:35.471
I am the one person
that doesn't need your help.

45:35.994 --> 45:37.038
I'm fine.

45:38.039 --> 45:40.017
Well, this is me.

45:40.041 --> 45:41.758
I'll see you tomorrow,

45:41.782 --> 45:42.759
and thanks for dinner.

45:42.783 --> 45:44.829
It was...
Interesting?

45:45.307 --> 45:46.526
Exactly.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.853
Good night.
Good night.

45:49.877 --> 45:51.357
And good luck
with bridesmaids' yoga.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.142
Be strong.

45:59.321 --> 46:00.864
And we greet the morning

46:00.888 --> 46:04.215
as we complete
our sun salutations,

46:04.239 --> 46:07.001
moving into Warrior I,

46:07.025 --> 46:09.549
welcoming peace.

46:11.986 --> 46:13.790
Tess? Tess!

46:13.814 --> 46:15.966
Are you sure
I did the seating plan okay?

46:15.990 --> 46:16.967
Yes!

46:16.991 --> 46:18.142
There's not too many strangers

46:18.166 --> 46:19.796
sitting together at each table?

46:19.820 --> 46:22.016
No. No, you're good.
I checked.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.279
And reaching for the earth,

46:24.303 --> 46:27.761
embracing a calming inner light.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.240
So this missing
boyfriend of yours,

46:29.264 --> 46:30.328
what's his deal anyway?

46:30.352 --> 46:31.721
Focus, please.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.679
And back to center,

46:33.703 --> 46:36.944
placing the elbow
on the knee and twist.

46:36.968 --> 46:39.100
And how long have you
been going out for?

46:40.101 --> 46:41.339
Almost two years.

46:41.363 --> 46:43.777
And he still didn't
come with you?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.604
I'll tell you why he isn't here.

46:45.628 --> 46:48.433
He's afraid he's going to have
to put a ring on that finger.

46:48.457 --> 46:50.131
It is not that at all!

46:50.155 --> 46:51.045
Ladies!

46:51.069 --> 46:52.089
Shh!

46:52.113 --> 46:54.700
You have to turn
the screws, honey.

46:54.724 --> 46:57.007
That's how I got
Henry to propose.

46:57.031 --> 46:59.183
Hey, Tess!
Michael?

46:59.207 --> 47:00.663
What?
What are you doing?

47:00.687 --> 47:02.123
Come with me
if you want to live.

47:11.306 --> 47:12.742
Namaste.

47:19.793 --> 47:21.902
That does not seem relaxing.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.556
Most tense yoga session ever,
actually.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.863
The Dalai Lama
would not have approved.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.473
Why do girls talk like that
when they're working out?

47:28.497 --> 47:31.563
Guys just work out
when they're working out.

47:31.587 --> 47:33.435
Anyway, forget about
all that and hurry,

47:33.459 --> 47:35.002
or we're going to be
late for our tee time.

47:35.026 --> 47:36.612
What?
I'm not playing golf.

47:36.636 --> 47:39.093
Sure you are... With them.

47:41.162 --> 47:42.574
What?

47:42.598 --> 47:44.576
Yeah, I ran into them
this morning at the Pro Shop,

47:44.600 --> 47:46.622
and since they were
looking for a foursome,

47:46.646 --> 47:48.406
and you wanted
to meet Dr. Hastings...

47:48.430 --> 47:50.408
What are you doing?

47:50.432 --> 47:52.541
I'm helping you help yourself.

47:52.565 --> 47:55.109
I've got to go change!
Okay.

47:55.133 --> 47:56.656
I'll get the cart.

47:58.919 --> 48:01.332
You're gonna like
this course. The greens are nice...

48:01.356 --> 48:02.638
Dr. Hastings?

48:02.662 --> 48:04.118
Dr. Harper.

48:04.142 --> 48:05.684
When they were kids,

48:05.708 --> 48:08.992
Tess here used to perform surgery
on Amber's broken dolls.

48:09.016 --> 48:13.605
And from what I hear, Tess's golf game
is as good as her bedside manner.

48:13.629 --> 48:16.086
Dr. Hastings,
in full disclosure,

48:16.110 --> 48:18.915
I'm a finalist for the
fellowship at Northwestern.

48:18.939 --> 48:21.091
Perfect. We can enjoy
our golf game

48:21.115 --> 48:23.639
and talk about anything
besides work.

48:25.641 --> 48:27.402
Bedside manner?

48:27.426 --> 48:29.360
I should have said bedside manner
first, then golf game after.

48:29.384 --> 48:32.233
I don't know if bedside manner
needed to be included at all.

48:32.257 --> 48:33.693
I know.

48:36.478 --> 48:38.152
So for my money,

48:38.176 --> 48:41.329
the best steak in Chicago,
Benny's Chop House, hands down.

48:41.353 --> 48:43.244
Oh, I'll be sure
to check it out.

48:43.268 --> 48:44.922
Ah!

48:47.620 --> 48:49.946
The bride has a question.

48:49.970 --> 48:51.687
I'm sure it can wait.

48:51.711 --> 48:53.297
Devoted to golf.

48:53.321 --> 48:54.951
I respect that.

48:54.975 --> 48:58.259
Yeah, except I think this wedding
is making me lose my mind.

48:59.632 --> 49:00.826
Oh!

49:00.850 --> 49:02.330
Terrific.

49:02.765 --> 49:03.853
Well...

49:05.377 --> 49:09.313
Wedding planner, says I
still owe her five grand.

49:09.337 --> 49:11.750
No matter.

49:14.603 --> 49:16.451
Yes, dear?

49:16.475 --> 49:21.630
Fine. I'm sure if they don't
have posies, then mums are fine.

49:21.654 --> 49:23.893
How much extra?

49:23.917 --> 49:25.808
Uh-uh. No. Fine.

49:25.832 --> 49:27.766
Yep.

49:27.790 --> 49:31.422
You know, I thought this wedding
would be a simple get-together,

49:31.446 --> 49:34.077
but now there's harpists,
there's a cheese sommelier,

49:34.101 --> 49:36.079
there's more food
than an army needs.

49:36.103 --> 49:38.386
There's a charging station
by the sangria bar.

49:38.410 --> 49:40.301
I mean, this isn't a wedding,
it's a, it's a...

49:40.325 --> 49:42.346
It's a runaway train.
Mr. Tilton!

49:42.370 --> 49:44.087
Henry?
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

49:44.111 --> 49:45.741
Michael, will you get the cart
and some water, please?

49:45.765 --> 49:47.003
Yep, on it.

49:47.027 --> 49:48.962
Take some deep breaths, okay?

49:48.986 --> 49:51.312
Do you feel dizzy or cold?

49:51.336 --> 49:53.749
No.
Okay, just breathe.

49:53.773 --> 49:55.185
I'm okay now.

49:55.209 --> 49:57.492
Yeah, I think it was
just a mild panic attack

49:57.516 --> 50:00.538
and maybe a little dehydration.

50:00.562 --> 50:03.063
You know, I'd really, really
like to get you out of the sun

50:03.087 --> 50:04.760
and rehydrated. Thank you.

50:04.784 --> 50:06.109
And up to the clubhouse.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.589
Do you think
you can get up okay?

50:07.613 --> 50:09.286
That sounds
like a good idea.Yeah.

50:09.310 --> 50:11.549
Listen, all of you,
you play on, okay?

50:11.573 --> 50:14.291
Sorry, sir,
not a chance, no, no.

50:14.315 --> 50:16.250
I need to re-check
your vitals inside.

50:16.274 --> 50:18.600
Here. Here, actually,
I'll take this for you.

50:18.624 --> 50:21.516
I think we've had enough
excitement for one day, yeah?

50:21.540 --> 50:23.257
Just breathe.

50:23.281 --> 50:25.041
Thank you.

50:25.065 --> 50:27.087
Good work out there. Good bedside manner.
Thanks for the assist.

50:27.111 --> 50:30.027
Look out, watch your head.
Okay. Ready?

50:31.289 --> 50:32.483
We're good?

50:32.507 --> 50:33.856
You're clear, yeah.
Go ahead.Okay.

50:34.988 --> 50:36.163
Not on the green!

50:40.124 --> 50:42.102
You guys are going
to love the dance lessons.

50:42.126 --> 50:43.451
Oh, are we?

50:43.475 --> 50:45.042
Uh, just...
Yep.

50:46.434 --> 50:48.499
You were pretty great out there,

50:48.523 --> 50:51.198
and I think Dr. Hastings
took notice.

50:51.222 --> 50:53.113
That was a nasty
trick you played,

50:53.137 --> 50:55.008
surprising me with golf,

50:55.574 --> 50:56.507
and a nice one.

50:56.531 --> 50:59.858
Uh, Jack?
Honey, let's start.

50:59.882 --> 51:03.123
Ooh, yeah, actually, I'm going
to have to sit this one out.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.950
What? Why?
Hmm? Oh, I...

51:04.974 --> 51:07.866
I did something to my
hamstring playing golf today.

51:07.890 --> 51:11.044
Oh, you know, dancing might help
stretch that hamstring out.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.742
You sure?
It's, like, it's really sore.

51:13.766 --> 51:16.745
Okay, yeah. You should probably
ice it and keep it inclined.

51:16.769 --> 51:18.616
Thanks, Doc.
I better get some ice, honey.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.314
You know, doctor's orders, so...

51:20.338 --> 51:22.557
I'm sorry. It seems super fun.

51:23.993 --> 51:25.275
But he...

51:25.299 --> 51:27.190
He's the one who needs
the dance lesson.

51:27.214 --> 51:28.931
He's got two left feet!

51:28.955 --> 51:31.760
And I want to look good
for our wedding dance.

51:31.784 --> 51:33.655
This is really important to me!

51:34.134 --> 51:35.440
It...

51:37.050 --> 51:39.855
Maybe you're right about
weddings making people crazy.

51:39.879 --> 51:42.162
Huh, you're beginning
to see the light.

51:42.186 --> 51:44.425
Partner up, people.

51:44.449 --> 51:47.080
We've got lots to learn,
and only an hour.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.212
Uh, partner up.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.214
Seems like we're being
tasked again.

51:51.238 --> 51:52.998
Come.
Positions.

51:54.763 --> 51:56.001
And...

51:56.025 --> 51:58.830
Well, I should warn you,
I am a little rusty.

51:58.854 --> 52:01.877
Whoo. And you're really good.

52:01.901 --> 52:03.661
Fringe benefit of
my near-miss wedding.

52:03.685 --> 52:05.968
My fiancee forced me
to get lessons

52:05.992 --> 52:08.666
for a ridiculous wedding dance
that never actually happened.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.712
Oh, don't blame it
on the wedding dance.

52:10.736 --> 52:11.843
Why not?

52:11.867 --> 52:13.889
Because the wedding dance is,

52:13.913 --> 52:16.109
it's beautiful. It's romantic.

52:16.133 --> 52:18.894
It's the first steps
a new couple takes together,

52:18.918 --> 52:21.462
under the lights
and with the music.

52:21.486 --> 52:24.247
Wow, you are a hopeless
romantic, aren't you?

52:24.271 --> 52:26.317
Emphasis on the 'hopeless.'

52:27.492 --> 52:28.797
Whoa!

52:29.058 --> 52:30.558
Ooh!

52:30.582 --> 52:32.864
Good.

52:32.888 --> 52:34.823
You've got some moves.

52:34.847 --> 52:36.477
Well, the ER
is a bit of a dance,

52:36.501 --> 52:39.306
you know, evading gurneys,
dodging bedpans...

52:39.330 --> 52:42.047
Yeah, I got it.
Yep, yep.Okay. Oh, no.

52:42.071 --> 52:43.005
What?

52:43.029 --> 52:44.963
Aunt Millie's all alone.

52:44.987 --> 52:47.531
As sorry
as I feel for Aunt Millie,

52:47.555 --> 52:49.490
you and I are here,
on the dance floor.

52:49.514 --> 52:51.535
Yeah, but that's the whole
thing about a wedding, right,

52:51.559 --> 52:53.624
is everybody gets
to join in the fun.

52:53.648 --> 52:54.997
It's okay.

52:56.085 --> 52:57.150
Fine.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.436
Oh...

53:00.264 --> 53:02.416
Oh, you know what?
I have to take this.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.224
I'll be right back, okay?

53:08.054 --> 53:09.336
Dex!

53:09.360 --> 53:10.772
Hi!

53:10.796 --> 53:12.382
Are you ready for your trip?

53:12.406 --> 53:13.818
All systems go.

53:13.842 --> 53:15.472
Don't forget
your Dramamine. Done.

53:15.496 --> 53:16.734
And how's it going with you?

53:16.758 --> 53:20.347
Uh, actually, surprisingly fun.

53:20.371 --> 53:22.610
What's all that noise?
Oh, it's music.

53:22.634 --> 53:23.828
Just a little dancing going on.

53:23.852 --> 53:25.613
See everything you're missing?

53:25.637 --> 53:28.529
Hey, hold on a sec. I've got to
get rid of another call here.

53:28.553 --> 53:29.747
Hello?

53:29.771 --> 53:31.575
Hello... Dex?

53:31.599 --> 53:32.731
Hello?

53:34.950 --> 53:36.256
Ugh.

53:37.823 --> 53:40.932
Quick, quick, slow, slow.

53:40.956 --> 53:44.414
Quick, quick, slow, slow.

53:44.438 --> 53:46.068
Move faster with that one.

53:46.092 --> 53:49.506
Slow. Quick, quick,
slow, slow.

53:49.530 --> 53:51.682
Yes...

53:51.706 --> 53:55.014
Slow, slow.
Quick, quick, slow.

53:59.932 --> 54:02.824
There is nothing
like Chicago pizza.

54:02.848 --> 54:05.479
Well, you won't be without it
much longer, right?

54:05.503 --> 54:06.982
Mmm? Yeah.

54:08.288 --> 54:09.831
Let me guess.

54:09.855 --> 54:12.118
Dex hasn't agreed to Chicago
if you get the fellowship?

54:13.772 --> 54:16.141
Okay, it's fine. You don't
want to talk about it.

54:16.165 --> 54:18.907
I won't twist your arm. I've
got enough on my mind already.

54:20.692 --> 54:22.757
Is that... No.

54:22.781 --> 54:24.217
Wha...

54:24.522 --> 54:25.827
Jack!

54:27.351 --> 54:28.613
Hey, hon.

54:30.136 --> 54:33.028
What are you doing,
creeping around?

54:33.052 --> 54:37.119
What? Uh, I was just

54:37.143 --> 54:39.643
getting some ice
for my hamstring.

54:39.667 --> 54:42.603
Yeah, I don't want
to limp down the aisle.

54:42.627 --> 54:43.604
That wouldn't be good.

54:43.628 --> 54:45.867
Uh, but you guys have fun, okay?

54:45.891 --> 54:48.739
Better go before the ice
machine closes, though, so,

54:48.763 --> 54:50.461
I'll see you guys in a bit.

54:52.071 --> 54:52.961
What is he up to?

54:52.985 --> 54:54.465
Sneaking around,

54:55.727 --> 54:56.965
ducking out on duties.

54:56.989 --> 54:58.227
Amber...

54:58.251 --> 55:00.011
'Boyfriend Jack' is wonderful,

55:00.035 --> 55:03.798
but what if there is a 'Married
Jack' that I don't know yet,

55:03.822 --> 55:05.582
who keeps secrets,

55:05.606 --> 55:08.368
and doesn't care about the
things that are important to me?

55:08.392 --> 55:10.848
Oh, Amber, where do I start?

55:10.872 --> 55:12.763
Tess, am I getting cold feet?

55:12.787 --> 55:16.027
You should really talk to Jack
about these worries.

55:16.051 --> 55:18.334
Communication
is the best medicine.

55:18.358 --> 55:21.424
I know, I know,
but I'm afraid to.

55:21.448 --> 55:22.643
It's the wedding week.

55:22.667 --> 55:24.601
I don't want
to have a big showdown.

55:24.625 --> 55:27.735
I just wish that he would
make an extra effort

55:27.759 --> 55:29.302
once in a while.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.545
And, Tess,
you deserve that, too.

55:32.764 --> 55:34.219
Don't give me that look.

55:34.243 --> 55:36.439
You don't think you deserve
the same thing from Dex?

55:36.463 --> 55:39.007
Look, we are talking
about you right now.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.749
Yeah, well, don't worry.
Cold feet aren't contagious.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.533
Well, don't you worry.

55:43.557 --> 55:45.709
You are going to have
the fairytale wedding

55:45.733 --> 55:47.581
you have dreamed of
since we were kids.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.084
I promise.

55:54.176 --> 55:56.285
That was very sweet of you
back there,

55:56.309 --> 55:58.224
asking Aunt Millie to dance.

55:59.443 --> 56:02.465
Hey, she's got
a fantastic foxtrot.

56:02.489 --> 56:04.249
I may have misjudged
you a little.

56:04.273 --> 56:05.773
Yeah? I think it's possible

56:05.797 --> 56:08.602
that I might've misjudged you
just a tiny bit, too.

56:08.626 --> 56:10.386
Hmm.

56:10.410 --> 56:12.301
So listen,
tomorrow's a pretty big day.

56:12.325 --> 56:14.999
We have the rehearsal,
you have your slide show,

56:15.023 --> 56:15.957
but I was thinking...

56:15.981 --> 56:17.872
Oh, you are not suggesting

56:17.896 --> 56:20.178
we play hooky
on our wedding duties.

56:20.202 --> 56:22.920
No, we still help
with the wedding,

56:22.944 --> 56:25.575
but then we also take
some time for some R&R,

56:25.599 --> 56:28.273
some fun!

56:28.297 --> 56:30.125
Yeah? Best of both worlds.

56:30.909 --> 56:32.669
What do you think?

56:32.693 --> 56:33.651
Deal?

56:35.435 --> 56:36.480
Deal.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.197
Yeah.

56:39.221 --> 56:41.006
And good night to you, too.

56:41.876 --> 56:42.921
Okay.

56:49.014 --> 56:50.992
What a great way
to start the day.

56:51.016 --> 56:52.776
You mind if we stop,
just for a minute?

56:52.800 --> 56:54.125
Oh!

56:54.149 --> 56:56.127
I thought for sure
you'd be able to keep up.

56:56.151 --> 56:58.826
Well, A, I did keep up, and B, it's
three times around the golf course.

56:58.850 --> 56:59.783
It's a lot of running.

56:59.807 --> 57:01.132
But you're a lawyer.

57:01.156 --> 57:03.134
I thought you'd be
especially long-winded.

57:03.158 --> 57:04.309
Ha, that's very funny.

57:04.333 --> 57:06.442
Can we just take a little break?

57:06.466 --> 57:08.836
Break? This is... I'm supposed
to be having fun today.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.012
Yes, fun, but not at my expense.

57:11.036 --> 57:12.622
All right, well, let's see,

57:12.646 --> 57:14.755
we still have time before
the wedding rehearsal,

57:14.779 --> 57:17.564
so we could schedule... Schedule?
No way. You can't schedule fun.

57:18.478 --> 57:20.195
Hey, guys.

57:20.219 --> 57:21.675
The bakery's van just pulled up.

57:21.699 --> 57:24.417
Could I possibly draft
you to take a look?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.288
Sure, yeah. Piece of cake.

57:26.312 --> 57:28.009
Oh, thank you!

57:29.271 --> 57:30.466
Very funny.

57:30.490 --> 57:32.013
Thank you.

57:35.974 --> 57:38.169
Exactly as the bride requested.

57:38.193 --> 57:42.478
Belgian cocoa, French cream,
the finest Japanese marzipan,

57:42.502 --> 57:47.178
and I crafted the cake topper also, as
requested, in pure Madagascar sugar,

57:47.202 --> 57:49.703
infused with orange blossoms
and vanilla.

57:49.727 --> 57:51.792
Wow. Nice work.

57:51.816 --> 57:52.967
We aim to please.

57:52.991 --> 57:54.925
On time, and on budget,

57:54.949 --> 57:56.927
and the mayor's going to
hear about this, right?

57:56.951 --> 57:59.147
Yes, of course.
I'm a man of my word.

57:59.171 --> 58:00.931
Thank you so, so much.

58:00.955 --> 58:04.718
It's perfect. The bride
is going to be so happy.

58:04.742 --> 58:08.112
Okay, we need to get this cake
into that refrigerator.

58:08.136 --> 58:09.636
Yep.
Yep, and just, just...

58:09.660 --> 58:12.639
Ooh, be so, so, so, so careful.
It is a masterpiece.

58:12.663 --> 58:14.641
Yes...
Watch the corner!

58:14.665 --> 58:16.512
Oh!
Come on!

58:16.536 --> 58:19.776
Okay, okay... Oh, no, the
sugar groom's arm fell off!

58:19.800 --> 58:20.951
Uh-oh.

58:20.975 --> 58:22.562
This is very bad.
It's very bad.

58:22.586 --> 58:25.086
Very bad. Maybe Amber, she
might not even notice that.

58:25.110 --> 58:26.435
Are you kidding?

58:26.459 --> 58:28.872
Amber would notice
a flower petal out of place

58:28.896 --> 58:31.005
on a centerpiece 100 feet away.

58:31.029 --> 58:32.746
She sees bad omens
in every mistake!

58:32.770 --> 58:33.964
What are we going to do?

58:33.988 --> 58:35.662
We can sub in a plastic one.

58:35.686 --> 58:36.793
Plastic?

58:36.817 --> 58:39.404
No, no,
plastic's not going to work.

58:39.428 --> 58:41.518
So what do you suggest?
What can we do?

58:44.825 --> 58:47.151
Nurse, a little
more light, please.

58:47.175 --> 58:48.718
Oh, yeah, gladly.

58:48.742 --> 58:50.831
And thanks for bumping me
up to nurse.

58:52.180 --> 58:54.835
Okay, frosting?

58:55.488 --> 58:57.142
Frosting, check.

58:59.927 --> 59:01.538
Okay.

59:02.016 --> 59:03.583
Now...

59:06.107 --> 59:07.955
Nope... Yes!

59:07.979 --> 59:09.652
Ooh.

59:09.676 --> 59:12.394
The ulna and the radius are
going to make a full recovery.

59:12.418 --> 59:14.004
Wow.

59:14.028 --> 59:16.354
I'd say you've got a pretty
steady hand in a crisis.

59:16.378 --> 59:20.315
I knew that surgical residency
would pay off one day.

59:20.339 --> 59:22.404
Well, now that
the crisis is averted,

59:22.428 --> 59:25.276
I think it's time for some of
that fun that you promised.

59:25.300 --> 59:26.669
What did you have in mind?

59:26.693 --> 59:28.932
I was thinking
maybe a little golf,

59:28.956 --> 59:30.567
not for networking,
just for fun.

59:32.046 --> 59:33.352
Nice.

59:42.491 --> 59:43.425
Seriously?

59:43.449 --> 59:44.668
Nice!

59:58.986 --> 01:00:00.573
Why are you so quiet?

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.183
Off my game a little bit,

01:00:02.207 --> 01:00:04.098
but I'm gracious in defeat,

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:06.796
or pretending to be.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.320
We still have a little time
before the rehearsal,

01:00:09.344 --> 01:00:10.713
and a golf cart at our disposal.

01:00:10.737 --> 01:00:13.542
What say we explore
the resort a little bit?

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.239
Explore?

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:16.806
Yeah, there's probably some
great picnic areas around here.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.244
You know what, I really should
check on a few patients.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:22.314
What, you're not on call
this week, are you?

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:26.207
And they're in good hands?

01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:27.730
So they'll be fine.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.408
And you remember
our deal, right?

01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:31.802
Fun when our work is done?

01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.695
You know what,
you're right. I'm what?

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:36.937
Does this thing have a stereo?

01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:38.678
Hope so.

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:42.639
All right.

01:00:43.552 --> 01:00:44.945
Let's rock and roll!

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:52.407
I wonder where Tess is.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.409
She's not answering
any of my calls.

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.585
What do you need her for,
dear? Maybe I can help.

01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:59.177
No, I just wanted to check in.

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:01.155
Amber?

01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:02.765
Dad? What is it?

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:05.855
You arranged the orders
for the rehearsal dinner?

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:08.075
No, Jack did. Why?

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.903
Well, there's been
some confusion.

01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:12.079
The caterers are here now,
and apparently,

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:14.777
the vegan dinners are chicken.

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:16.300
What?

01:01:16.324 --> 01:01:18.955
Jack was supposed
to handle this!

01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:20.957
Maybe you can give him a call.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.959
I have been trying to text him
for over an hour!

01:01:22.983 --> 01:01:25.092
There's no answer.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.616
Bernadette, have you seen Jack?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.924
I saw him with the other groomsmen
back at the Commodore Club.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:32.795
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.710
Unbelievable!

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:36.669
Amber, Amber, big breaths.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.148
In...

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:40.087
And out...

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.068
Enjoying some of
the wedding perks?

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:46.920
Think I'm starting
to get the hang of it.

01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:51.858
What do you think that cloud
looks like right there?

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:53.468
Oh, obviously, it's a kidney.

01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:55.339
No, obviously, it's a gavel.

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:57.646
Everyone sees the world
through their own filter.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.388
To cows, all they see is grass.

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:01.563
That's true.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:02.825
To the cows, then.

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:04.285
To the cows.

01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:09.377
Michael, I just want
to say thank you.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.355
For what?

01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:14.078
For reminding me to enjoy
myself while I'm here.

01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:17.622
You're welcome.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:18.996
Thank you, too.

01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:21.365
For what?

01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:24.804
Well, I've spent the last three
years splitting people apart.

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.501
It's nice to actually
play a small role

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:28.285
in bringing people together.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.418
So thanks for roping me in.

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.032
That cloud now
looks like a bunny.

01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:38.667
Oh, ooh, and
that one looks like a heart. A heart!

01:02:40.408 --> 01:02:41.951
Oops, sorry.
My fault!

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:45.128
That is totally my fault.
It is your fault.

01:02:45.152 --> 01:02:47.652
You know what? We should probably
get to this rehearsal dinner.

01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:49.916
I told Mrs. Tilton I would
set up the slideshow, and...

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.526
Oh, my gosh, my phone is dead.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.657
My phone never dies!

01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:53.702
Hold on.

01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:55.356
What time do you have?
What time?

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.445
5:20. We kind of
lost track of time.

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:59.273
Yeah, we're late!
We're running late!

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:02.319
We've got to go! Yes, we've
got to go, right now.

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:05.018
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.110
Amber?

01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:11.807
Huh? Forget? No!

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.678
No, I'm coming down the hall
right now!

01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:14.636
Yep!

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.985
Oh, I know.

01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:20.598
I am so, so sorry
that I missed the rehearsal,

01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:22.886
but, no, I'm here.
Yep, here I come.

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:28.674
Hi.

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:32.765
Oh! Oh, shoot.

01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:34.506
Okay...

01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:49.695
Hi!

01:03:54.395 --> 01:03:55.459
Where have you been?

01:03:55.483 --> 01:03:57.679
I am so sorry.
I lost track of time.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.768
This rehearsal dinner,
I mean, it's a disaster.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.359
Just take a deep breath.

01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.381
Okay. That's right.
That's good.

01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:06.383
And relax.
Now, go sit down.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.343
I'm going
to get this fancy video out,

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:10.692
going to entertain everybody.

01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:13.564
Jack's responsibility
was the presentation!

01:04:13.588 --> 01:04:15.784
I can explain, but later.

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.027
You go sit down, okay?

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:22.182
Jack, why did you pass
the presentation on to Tess?

01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:24.271
Honey, relax, okay?
She's got it,

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.577
and you've got dessert coming.

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:27.602
It's going to be great.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.060
Um...

01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:34.629
I'd like to welcome you all
here, and, uh,

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:36.631
before we have dessert,

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:40.896
I'd just like to say how grateful
I am that we are all here

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.575
to celebrate the happy couple,

01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:45.838
Amber and Jack.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:52.995
And I have a very
special treat for you,

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:56.390
courtesy of the wonderful
technical assistance

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:59.610
of our multi-talented
maid of honor, Tess,

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:03.092
some beautiful moments
and tender memories

01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:06.946
from the happy couple's lives,
for your viewing pleasure.

01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:09.296
Uh...

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:11.255
Uh...

01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:14.930
Um...

01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.324
Tess?
Just one second!

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:18.958
Just a small technical glitch.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.023
Just a moment.

01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:23.702
Hurry. Come on.

01:05:28.446 --> 01:05:30.511
Ah!

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:33.862
This tutorial will cover recent
innovations in bunion treatment

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:36.821
as well as...
Why isn't it working?

01:05:36.845 --> 01:05:39.563
A bunion presents typically
as a bony prominence

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.697
from realignment of the joint
at the base of the toes...

01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:44.481
This is wrong,
this is wrong. No.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:46.788
Treatment of bunions
may include rest,

01:05:46.812 --> 01:05:49.443
icing, and orthotics...
I'll see if I can help her.

01:05:49.467 --> 01:05:52.949
More drastic measures include
medication and surgery.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.536
I clicked the wrong file!

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.625
What happened? Oh, my gosh.

01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.129
That's...
That is disgusting.

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:01.890
Oh. Oh...

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:03.481
I clicked, I don't know!

01:06:04.134 --> 01:06:05.459
I'm trying to...

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:06.875
There, does it work?

01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.793
I think it worked.
Yeah.

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:14.729
Amber...
Just...

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.948
Amber!

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.166
It's not so bad, right?

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.038
It's so bad.
Somebody didn't notice.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:21.934
That was so bad.
Everyone noticed.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:25.696
Amber, I am so sorry.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.481
This whole fiasco
is all my fault.

01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:29.135
I should've planned more
for my presentation.

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:31.528
No, the presentation
was Jack's responsibility,

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:34.923
and the catering,
and he failed at them both.

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:37.578
Hey... So
Tess did need help!

01:06:37.602 --> 01:06:39.623
I... Was busy.

01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:41.669
Doing what? Hanging out
with your groomsmen?

01:06:41.693 --> 01:06:42.713
No...

01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:44.280
I mean, technically, yes, but...

01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.760
Look, Amber, I think
you've got this all wrong.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:47.327
Jack has a really good
reason for being away.

01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:50.136
Why does everybody keep
making excuses for him?

01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.747
Amber! Amber!

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:56.031
Hoo!

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.884
Weddings, they really
bring out the best in people.

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:11.046
This is not good.
The bride has melted down.

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:12.221
She's been upset with me
all week.

01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:13.614
Maybe I should just
tell her the truth?

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:14.963
That is not a good idea.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.704
Okay, but should I be
taking advice

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:18.575
from a divorce attorney?

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:22.492
Funny. Jack, I'm your best
man, and I'm your best friend.

01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:23.865
It's my advice.

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:27.628
Honey, I am so sorry,

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:31.632
but this will all be over
tomorrow, in a good way!

01:07:31.656 --> 01:07:33.764
I just don't think I can go
through with this wedding.

01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:35.244
Oh, Amber, it'll be okay.

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:37.464
Just go inside. Relax.

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.683
I will check in
on you later, okay?

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:41.274
Thanks, Tess.

01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:50.912
I took my eye off the ball.

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:52.827
It's not so bad. It could
have been a lot worse.

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:56.918
Yeah, yeah. I could have clicked
on the nose job presentation.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.007
And in my efforts
to try and help everyone,

01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.878
I ended up ruining everything.

01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:02.271
I let down my friend,

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:04.534
and you want to know
the icing on the cake?

01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:08.277
I sabotaged any chance,
any chance at that fellowship.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:10.801
Just a sec,
the fellowship? Yeah!

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:12.977
I didn't exactly wow
Dr. Hastings

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.675
with my organizational skills.

01:08:14.699 --> 01:08:16.024
Tess, I think
this is all in your head.

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:18.069
This has nothing to do
with your qualifications.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.573
And you want to know
the worst of it?

01:08:20.573 --> 01:08:22.314
I botched the wedding.

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:26.165
Okay, look, it is wonderful

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:27.688
how much you take care
of everybody else,

01:08:27.712 --> 01:08:29.993
but I think...
Thank you.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:33.389
And really, the silver
lining in all of this

01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:37.828
is that you have just proven
yourself to be a really great guy,

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:39.288
and I...

01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:43.443
Dex?

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:44.705
Surprise!

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:47.142
Let me guess.
The missing boyfriend?

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:50.276
Uh, yeah, he's not
supposed to be here.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.799
I think that's probably
my cue to go.

01:08:51.823 --> 01:08:53.975
No, no, no. No.
Stay, meet him.

01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:56.175
No, you guys have a good night.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:01.615
Hey, beautiful.

01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:05.073
Hi!

01:09:05.096 --> 01:09:07.011
What a surprise!
Hey.

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:11.993
Yeah. Didn't expect this.
It's good to see you.

01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:14.169
Yeah.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:17.520
I don't understand. I
didn't think you were coming.

01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:19.261
I know, but then I realized

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:20.435
how important this was to you,

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.027
and I wanted to surprise you.

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:25.962
Well, mission accomplished.

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:30.011
Tess, I've been thinking a lot
about the last couple weeks,

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:34.058
the fellowship at Northwestern,
everything, really,

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:36.389
and I started to see that I've
been handling this all wrong.

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.453
How so?

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.368
I know how hard you've worked
for this fellowship,

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:43.242
and even getting this far
is an accomplishment,

01:09:43.265 --> 01:09:45.983
and it wasn't fair of me
to not support you in that.

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:47.594
Especially since I didn't come
to the table

01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:49.073
with a strong counter-offer.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:50.944
A counter-offer?

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:54.383
I have a solution for this
whole Chicago-Boston thing.

01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:55.626
What if I proposed?

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.299
Proposed?

01:09:57.323 --> 01:09:59.736
Well, proposed to propose?

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.651
What if I finally pulled
the trigger on this?

01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:03.349
Um...

01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:05.786
Dex, are you trying to keep me
from taking the fellowship

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.614
by asking me to marry you?

01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:08.943
No!

01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:10.878
No, I...

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:12.208
Not exactly.

01:10:13.165 --> 01:10:14.795
Because I didn't get it.

01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:16.927
Great!
Great?

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.712
No... I...

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:23.044
Oh. Dex, look, I have
a counter-proposal for you...

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.830
That we just be friends.

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:28.461
But we're such a great team.

01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:30.854
Teams support each other,

01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:35.250
but with us,
it's always me supporting you,

01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:39.689
helping you re-do your office, or helping
you get that all-important promotion,

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:42.039
or just supporting you
in work in general.

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:43.737
Tess...
Dex,

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.676
you are not the bad guy here.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:47.939
I chose this,

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:51.899
and I can choose something new.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.297
Is that what you truly want?

01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:01.953
It is.

01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:06.697
Okay.

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:38.685
Hi.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.034
Hi.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:42.883
Finally got in a round of golf.

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:44.865
Yeah, just hitting
a couple balls.

01:11:49.609 --> 01:11:53.285
Michael, I really need to ask
your help for something.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:56.026
Can you please tell me where the
groom has been hiding himself?

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:58.725
I don't know, Tess.
I've been sworn to secrecy.

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:02.337
See, Amber's actually thinking of
not going through with the wedding,

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:05.427
and she can't find
the groom, yet again.

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:08.541
This will be the last favor
I do for the bride.

01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:10.848
Then I'm done.

01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.353
I did find out

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:20.094
where your missing groom
has been spending his time.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.313
You did?

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.923
The Shangri-La room
up in the clubhouse.

01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:25.099
Oh, thank goodness!

01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:27.362
Tess, can you go
talk to him for me?

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:29.475
Just find out
what's been going on,

01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:32.019
straighten this all out?

01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:34.064
The rest is up to you.

01:12:34.088 --> 01:12:36.177
You have to go
talk to him yourself.

01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:39.592
But you're my best friend.

01:12:39.616 --> 01:12:41.333
Exactly,

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.968
and it's time for you
to stand on your own two feet.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.340
Wait, where are you going?

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.149
I am treating myself
to a spa day.

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:57.155
Maddy?

01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:59.220
Hi, stranger.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:01.091
How's it going, Tess?

01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:02.658
Let me guess.

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:04.530
Putting out fires for the bride?

01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:08.316
Actually, you couldn't be
farther from the truth.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.711
I am in a robe,
headed to the spa for a visit.

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:12.886
Robe?

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:14.757
Spa?

01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:16.411
I must've called
the wrong number.

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:18.263
This is Tess Harper, right?

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:20.546
I think so.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.659
Oh, Maddy,
it's all just been so crazy.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:25.551
Dex showed up.

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:26.943
Maddy, it's over.

01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.337
I did what I should have done
a long time ago.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:30.188
Really?

01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:32.277
Are you okay?

01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:35.280
Actually... Yes.

01:13:36.107 --> 01:13:38.825
Then congratulations.

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:41.567
I've got to run. Doc Williams
needs me on an appendectomy.

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.090
Thank you, Maddy.

01:13:43.114 --> 01:13:44.550
Bye for now.
Bye.

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:49.096
Your shoulders are like granite.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.273
You're carrying the weight
of the world all yourself.

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:54.884
I think maybe
I've been trying to.

01:13:54.908 --> 01:13:57.757
But the world keeps spinning,

01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:00.044
with or without
my problem-solving skills.

01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:02.873
Turn around, please.

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:08.942
So, which do you want?

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:13.057
The hot stone treatment, Shiatsu,
or maybe a relaxation wrap?

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:15.581
All of the above.

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:32.424
Jack!

01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:34.707
What's going on?

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:36.883
Amber, um...
Okay, I...

01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:39.320
I don't know what the heck
is going on here, but...

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:41.757
It's a dance lesson,
the last of 10,

01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:43.803
and time's a-wasting.

01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:46.351
A dance lesson? Can you
just give us a second?

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.636
This is what I've been doing.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.291
Bernadette was standing in for you to
help me, to prep for the wedding dance.

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:56.816
You know
what a terrible dancer I am.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.557
I just...

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.278
I wanted to surprise you.

01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:04.412
I am surprised.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:06.719
Oh!

01:15:10.157 --> 01:15:11.265
Ooh!

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:13.160
That's the tango.
Nice!

01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:15.685
I'm still working on it.

01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:29.176
Great minds think alike.

01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:31.590
Excuse me?

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:34.418
An old trick I learned working
the ER out of med school,

01:15:34.442 --> 01:15:36.009
grab rest when you can.

01:15:39.447 --> 01:15:40.860
Wise words.

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:42.818
That's quite a presentation
you made yesterday.

01:15:42.842 --> 01:15:46.039
Oh. Don't remind me.

01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:49.085
It was an honor to meet you,
Dr. Hastings,

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:50.913
and I really do hope

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:54.177
that our paths will cross
sometime in the distant future.

01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:56.832
Why do you say that? Are you
withdrawing from the fellowship?

01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:59.182
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:01.620
I just... I just assumed,
after yesterday,

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.926
and that, um...

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:07.277
Anyway, it was,
it was an honor to meet you.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:09.628
Just tell me,
for future reference,

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.761
should I call you Tess,
or Dr. Harper?

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:15.634
Huh? Well, I meant what I
said back at our golf game.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:18.027
What happens at this wedding

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:20.377
has no bearing
on the committee's decision,

01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:22.099
good or bad.

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:25.861
Oh, and, um,

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:27.887
your office will be down
the hall from mine.

01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:31.171
Uh...

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:33.173
I'm sorry.

01:16:33.197 --> 01:16:34.696
I don't understand.
I don't think I'm...

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.046
The board voted
yesterday to accept you,

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:39.005
but the decision
was only made public today.

01:16:39.029 --> 01:16:41.398
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you any earlier,

01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:44.880
but when I saw you in
action on the golf course,

01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:46.645
I knew we made
the right decision.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.825
Yes!

01:16:53.957 --> 01:16:57.153
Oh, um, sorry. Oh, sorry.

01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:59.242
And what are you smiling about?

01:17:00.703 --> 01:17:02.158
I got the fellowship!

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:04.508
Oh, Tessie! That's great!

01:17:04.532 --> 01:17:06.119
Does this mean you're
going to stay in Chicago?

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:07.120
Yeah!
Yay!

01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:09.078
Yeah, Dex and I are through.

01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:10.732
Yeah, it just,
it wasn't a match.

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:11.864
No.

01:17:11.888 --> 01:17:13.213
How are you doing?

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:14.475
Good.

01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:16.042
You know, everything's fixed.

01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:18.522
And you fixed it. See, you
stood up for yourself.

01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:20.089
You didn't need my help.

01:17:20.113 --> 01:17:22.570
No, just a push.

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:26.618
So, now that you're
going to be in town,

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.948
maybe there's a better
match for you here?

01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:32.536
What are you getting at?

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.147
No one knows you
like I do, Tess,

01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:35.844
and from the first moment

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:38.760
that Jack introduced me
to Michael, I just,

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:41.850
I knew that the two
of you would hit it off.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:44.026
And then when Dex bailed on you,

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:46.028
it just, you know,
that was the final straw.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:49.510
Final straw for what?
Well, you gave me a push.

01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:51.773
More like a shove.
Yeah.

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.514
Well, I gave you one, too.

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:54.907
What are you talking about?

01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:56.169
Well,

01:17:56.193 --> 01:17:58.586
I thought I'd indulge
in a little fiction

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:02.654
to try and get you to spend
some time with Michael.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.220
Wait, so...

01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:07.441
So what, this whole Bridezilla
thing, it was all an act?

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:10.270
Well, no, unfortunately,
that part, that part was real,

01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:13.229
but the part where Michael
picked you up at the airport,

01:18:13.253 --> 01:18:15.101
and the rest...

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:18.365
I just remembered, the
rental car is in Dex's name.

01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:21.847
Oh, don't worry. I'll arrange
someone to pick you up.

01:18:21.871 --> 01:18:23.873
Oh, no, you don't have
to do that, truly.

01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:27.026
Michael?

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.854
Yeah? All set.

01:18:28.878 --> 01:18:31.770
Oh, Jack thanks you
and I thank you.

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:34.990
Do you mind picking up my
friend Tess from the airport?

01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:36.557
Sure.

01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.254
Anything to get out of Wedding
Central for a minute.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:40.300
Great. I'll text you the info.

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:42.519
Okay.

01:18:42.543 --> 01:18:44.739
Amber? Hello? Are you there?
I lost you.

01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:47.089
Yup. Still here.

01:18:47.113 --> 01:18:49.178
Think my WiFi is on the fritz.

01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:51.180
And technically,

01:18:51.204 --> 01:18:54.207
I don't have an Aunt Karen
bringing me something blue.

01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:57.230
Sending you two
on that scavenger hunt,

01:18:57.254 --> 01:18:59.711
that was just a ruse to try and
get you to spend time together.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.191
Why, you sneaky...
Hey.

01:19:02.215 --> 01:19:05.107
I know my best friend,
and you do like a challenge,

01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:07.806
and Michael likes a woman
who can think for herself.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:12.071
I can't believe
you would do that to me.

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:14.464
No, not 'to' you,
Tess. 'For' you.

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:16.075
I mean, there's no way

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.381
I was going to let you choose
Dex over the fellowship.

01:19:18.405 --> 01:19:21.254
He never treated
you as a priority,

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:24.083
and everybody knew
that except for you.

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:28.914
Well, things didn't exactly
work out with Michael.

01:19:28.938 --> 01:19:32.506
But thank you
for being worried about me.

01:19:33.986 --> 01:19:35.572
Now, I'm sorry,

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:38.445
I think we have
a wedding to get to.

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:39.707
Oh.

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:41.317
Oh, yeah, it's...
Do you like my dress?

01:19:41.341 --> 01:19:42.710
Oh, yeah, you're ready.
Let's go.

01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:44.083
Okay.
No, you're good.

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:49.064
I know you're
allergic to weddings.

01:19:49.088 --> 01:19:51.806
You'll let me know
if you start feeling faint?

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.895
And you let me know
if you feel any compulsion

01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:55.679
to fix any
of the floral arrangements.

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:58.489
Actually, your boutonniere
is a little off.

01:19:59.142 --> 01:20:01.100
Let me just...

01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:04.471
Last thing I'll fix, I promise.

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:05.864
Here goes.

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:07.169
Be strong,

01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:08.780
and if you start seeing stars,

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.631
it's just people throwing rice.

01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:15.264
Wow, you look like a man
headed to the gallows.

01:20:15.288 --> 01:20:16.942
Any last words?

01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:21.357
We made a good team.

01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:22.643
We did.

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:27.189
Friends and family,

01:20:27.213 --> 01:20:29.278
we are gathered here today

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.628
to witness and to celebrate

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:34.893
the union of Amber and Jack
in marriage.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:37.310
I believe they've
written their own vows.

01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:41.749
Amber,

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:47.644
I vow to always love you
and to make you happy,

01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:50.280
in championship seasons
and in slumps,

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:53.172
on sunny days,

01:20:53.196 --> 01:20:55.459
and really cold ones when I
have to use a snowblower.

01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:59.985
I will always be there for you.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.964
Jack,

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:06.818
a friend showed me this week
what true caring means...

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.015
To help someone
when they need it,

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:12.432
and to let them
help themselves, too.

01:21:14.478 --> 01:21:16.543
I vow to love you

01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:19.004
and support you in every way.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.881
May we have the rings, please?

01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:41.524
Then, by the authority granted
by the state of Illinois,

01:21:41.548 --> 01:21:43.962
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:21:43.986 --> 01:21:44.900
You may kiss the bride.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.633
Finally.
Welcome to the family.

01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:05.331
No more bills.

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:08.725
Are you... Tearing up?

01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:10.118
Me? No, no.

01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:11.815
I think it's the, um...

01:22:11.839 --> 01:22:13.295
I think it's the flowers
or something.

01:22:13.319 --> 01:22:14.906
I don't think it's the flowers.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.385
Maybe somebody has a cat.

01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:19.499
Definitely no cats
at this wedding.

01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:21.608
Do you need a Kleenex?

01:22:21.632 --> 01:22:23.068
I'm okay.
Okay.

01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:30.095
I'm so happy.

01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:32.904
Okay, right.
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:44.065
Hello, everybody.

01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:47.721
My name is Tess.
I am the maid of honor.

01:22:47.745 --> 01:22:52.073
I am also the one responsible
for that slide show yesterday.

01:22:52.097 --> 01:22:53.901
You're welcome.

01:22:56.362 --> 01:23:00.453
Amber and I have been best
friends since kindergarten,

01:23:01.585 --> 01:23:03.867
and I just have to say

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:07.001
what a great friend
she has been.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:10.483
She absolutely deserves
this amazing wedding.

01:23:10.507 --> 01:23:15.705
See? Weddings are about
traditions and customs,

01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:17.949
some of which may seem crazy,

01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:20.232
some wonderful,

01:23:20.256 --> 01:23:23.607
but weddings
are also about having fun.

01:23:25.435 --> 01:23:28.153
And I just want
to thank a special someone

01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:31.963
for helping me realize
we can enjoy both.

01:23:35.662 --> 01:23:37.466
And now,

01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:39.797
it's time for a wedding dance.

01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:56.572
It's not bad.

01:23:56.596 --> 01:23:58.120
I'd say so.

01:24:00.513 --> 01:24:01.862
Where's Dex?

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:04.343
Headed back to Boston.

01:24:06.345 --> 01:24:10.108
I'm sure the two of you
will be very happy together.

01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:12.525
Oh, I'm sure
we'll be very happy,

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.442
just not together,
that's for sure.

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:19.595
What?

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:21.404
The thing is,

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:24.842
I got that fellowship I wanted.

01:24:25.582 --> 01:24:26.559
Yeah.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:27.453
Wow!

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.153
Congratulations! That's...

01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:36.264
So, Chicago, huh?

01:24:36.288 --> 01:24:37.178
That's...

01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:38.092
Yeah.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.703
See, the way I see it...

01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:42.947
Chicago has a lot of potential

01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:45.689
in a whole lot of ways.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.932
Don't worry.

01:24:51.956 --> 01:24:54.761
I know you're not a big fan
of the wedding dance.

01:24:54.785 --> 01:24:56.502
Yeah, that was before.

01:24:56.526 --> 01:24:57.657
Before what?

01:25:01.444 --> 01:25:02.532
Before you.

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:08.340
What was that thing that you
said about the wedding dance?

01:25:08.364 --> 01:25:14.065
It's the first steps two people
take in their life together,

01:25:14.631 --> 01:25:16.328
to music.

01:25:17.329 --> 01:25:18.591
Exactly.

01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:24.510
So... May I have this dance?

01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:33.191
This has been
my favorite wedding,

01:25:33.215 --> 01:25:35.062
so far.

01:25:35.086 --> 01:25:36.783
Mine too.

01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:56.020
I think they're, uh...

01:25:57.369 --> 01:25:59.869
You're such a matchmaker.

01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:02.069
That's the only reason you
had this wedding, isn't it?
