Carl Reiner: <i>Every morning
before having breakfast,</i>

00:30.448 --> 00:34.448
<i>I pick up my newspaper,
get the obituaries section,</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:37.123
<i>and see if I'm listed.</i>

00:37.163 --> 00:40.963
<i>If I'm not,
I'll have my breakfast.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:47.799
Jesus.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.550
Oh.

00:49.592 --> 00:53.182
<i>There was a picture of me
alongside Polly Bergen,</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:54.680
<i>who had passed away.</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:57.472
<i>I had not, I don't think.</i>

00:58.517 --> 01:00.347
I'm good.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.313
<i>They obviously didn't have
a good picture of her alone.</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:06.146
<i>But I wish they hadn't
picked a picture</i>

01:06.192 --> 01:07.822

Reiner: <i> For some reason, that Polly
Bergen obituary stayed with me.</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:05.853
<i>Polly passed away at 84,
but I'm in my 90s,</i>

05:05.889 --> 05:08.519
<i>and I have friends
who are in their 90s.</i>

05:08.559 --> 05:11.309
<i>How come we got the extra years?</i>

05:11.353 --> 05:14.983
<i>And it's not just that they've
reached a certain number;</i>

05:15.024 --> 05:16.524
<i>They're thriving.</i>

05:16.567 --> 05:18.357
<i>I myself am writing every day,</i>

05:18.402 --> 05:22.242
<i>just like I've been doing
most of my life.</i>

05:22.281 --> 05:24.201
<i>More and more,
I hear about people</i>

05:24.241 --> 05:26.321
<i>who are 30 years
past retirement age</i>

05:26.368 --> 05:27.908
<i>and refuse to retire.</i>

05:30.164 --> 05:32.254
<i>What's up with that?</i>

05:32.291 --> 05:35.671
<i>Was it luck, good genes,
modern medicine?</i>

05:37.504 --> 05:40.134
<i>Or are we doing something right?</i>

05:43.927 --> 05:46.337
<i>So, I have this nephew George.</i>

05:46.388 --> 05:48.348
<i>He's more than a nephew.</i>

05:48.390 --> 05:51.560
<i>He's also a friend
and my manager.</i>

05:51.602 --> 05:53.692
<i>The other day we were
talking, and it turns out</i>

05:53.729 --> 05:57.439
<i>he's been asking
that exact same question...</i>

05:57.483 --> 05:59.193
<i>Why are so many people</i>

05:59.234 --> 06:03.244
<i>living such active lives
into their 90s?</i>

06:03.280 --> 06:04.780
So he says, "Yeah, yeah, I know."

06:04.823 --> 06:07.243
But I feel I do my thing.
I take walks."

06:07.284 --> 06:10.914
George Shapiro: <i>When it comes to
making the most out of life after 90,</i>

06:10.954 --> 06:14.214
<i>I have two personal heroes...</i>

06:14.249 --> 06:16.829
<i>Carl and Betty Seinfeld.</i>

06:19.838 --> 06:22.338
<i>Betty Seinfeld, a lovely lady.</i>

06:24.635 --> 06:29.925
<i>She was just full of love
and laughter and joy.</i>

06:29.973 --> 06:32.183
She didn't make it to a hundred,

06:32.226 --> 06:35.226
but she lived her 99 years
to the fullest,

06:35.270 --> 06:36.810
and she's always in my heart.

06:41.235 --> 06:45.235
Carl was a total inspiration
for me after he turned 90

06:45.280 --> 06:47.320
because of his productivity

06:47.366 --> 06:51.116
and his commitment to being
vital and involved.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.509
Shapiro: <i>Since he turned 90,</i>

07:08.554 --> 07:11.184
he wrote five books.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.813
He's... and he started
on his sixth book.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.481
His computer is always busy.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.350
There's never a time
when he hasn't got

07:18.397 --> 07:21.147
something working in his
computer, which I love.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.531
You seem like you're very
knowledgeable about the Internet.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.609
You're very good at
sending out photographs,

07:25.654 --> 07:27.154
and you sort of seem to know

07:27.197 --> 07:28.657
the whole culture
of the Internet.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.949
A little bit, yes.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.702
You do selfies,
which I can't believe.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.993
Well, there's a thing
called the selfie,

07:34.037 --> 07:36.117
but a wonderful...
I feel so proud.

07:36.165 --> 07:39.325
When you come up with something
original... he was backstage,

07:39.376 --> 07:41.746
and I wanted to do
a selfie with him.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.625
Then I came up... I said, "I want to
do something better than the selfie,"

07:45.674 --> 07:48.884
so I did a selfishie.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.387
- A selfishie, yeah.
- A selfishie,

07:50.429 --> 07:53.599
but I let him be the star
of the selfishie.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.800

08:10.032 --> 08:12.532
Shapiro: <i>So, I suggested
that we make a documentary</i>

08:12.576 --> 08:15.906
<i>about having fun
and enjoying life after 90,</i>

08:15.954 --> 08:18.964
<i>and Carl thought
that was a fantastic idea.</i>

08:27.925 --> 08:29.652
Shapiro: <i>Many people have
a lot of misconceptions</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:32.336
<i>about what it's like to be 90,</i>

08:32.386 --> 08:34.967
<i>and most of those
are not positive.</i>

08:36.140 --> 08:38.520
When I'm 90,

08:38.559 --> 08:40.980
I think it's gonna be
very hard to walk.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.437
<i>I wouldn't get to do everything
I used to be able to do,</i>

08:47.486 --> 08:50.486
and it's possible
I won't be alive.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.610
Could you give us
the secret of your longevity?

08:52.658 --> 08:57.288
Well, the major thing,
the major thing

08:57.329 --> 09:02.619
is that I never,
ever touch fried food.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.498
I... I don't eat it.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.745
I wouldn't look at it,
and I don't touch it.

09:07.798 --> 09:11.008
And... and never run for a bus.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.631
<i>There'll always be another.</i>

09:12.678 --> 09:15.758
Even if... even if you're
late for work, you know,

09:15.806 --> 09:18.386
<i>I never run for a bus.
I never ran.</i>

09:18.433 --> 09:20.733
<i>I just strolled, jaunty, jolly,</i>

09:20.769 --> 09:23.189
<i>walking to the bus stop,
you know.</i>

09:23.230 --> 09:24.958
Dan Buettner:
<i>If you ask the average American</i>

09:24.982 --> 09:26.862
what the optimal formula
of longevity is,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.360
they probably couldn't tell you.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.362
They've probably heard
of the South Beach Diet

09:30.404 --> 09:31.654
or the Atkins Diet,

09:31.697 --> 09:34.107
and you have
the USDA Food Pyramid.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.657
There's a lot of confusion

09:35.701 --> 09:39.241
around what really helps us
live longer, better.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.015
Reiner: <i>When you want to
learn about something,</i>

09:41.039 --> 09:43.249
<i>it helps you to go to an expert.</i>

09:43.292 --> 09:45.462
<i>Believe it or not,
this young man</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:49.802
<i>is one of America's experts
on longevity and living well.</i>

09:49.840 --> 09:51.880
<i>I was curious
about what he had learned</i>

09:51.925 --> 09:55.795
<i>about staying vital
throughout your entire life.</i>

09:55.846 --> 09:59.506
The happiest people in America...
this is according to Gallup...

09:59.558 --> 10:04.518
Are interacting face-to-face
six to seven hours a day,

10:04.563 --> 10:05.983
not on Facebook.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.563
We evolved with these traits.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.977
We succeed as a species,

10:10.027 --> 10:13.147
because we know how
to collaborate and interact,

10:13.196 --> 10:15.566
and that in turn brings us joy,

10:15.615 --> 10:19.905
this simple act of sitting down
to breakfast with somebody

10:19.953 --> 10:22.453
or lunch with somebody
or meeting for happy hour.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.460
<i>Most of the things that are really
good for us, we like to do.</i>

10:28.503 --> 10:31.093
Mel Brooks:
<i>I was just out of the Army.</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:33.881
<i>I was just beginning to write
"The Show of Shows."</i>

10:33.925 --> 10:36.505
It was the first year of "The
Show of Shows" you were on,

10:36.553 --> 10:39.603
but it was the second year
of Sid Caesar being on the air.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.849
I remember that.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.811
And we became friends,
and he said,

10:42.851 --> 10:44.351
"What are you doing
this weekend?"

10:44.394 --> 10:47.314
And I said,
"What I do every weekend..."

10:47.356 --> 10:49.476
I walk around the streets.
I have a paper cup.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.364
I do a little dance in doorways.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.151
"I put the cup down.
Sometimes I make money."

10:54.196 --> 10:55.736
He said, "Come to Fire Island."

10:55.781 --> 10:57.951
I said, "Okay."
So, he took me to Fire Island.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.373
He didn't have a real place
for me to sleep,

11:01.411 --> 11:04.161
but there was a...
There was, like, a window.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.286
- An alcove. - An alcove that
jutted out with some cushions,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.628
and he said, "You could sleep
here." I said, "Oh, great."

11:09.652 --> 11:11.582
That was instead of sleeping
on somebody's porch.

11:11.621 --> 11:13.801
Which might have been mine.
I lived next door.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.470
He took me out there for a
weekend, Fire Island, very sweet.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.561
Reiner: <i>My kids were about
six and four at the time,</i>

11:25.602 --> 11:28.652
<i>and I said, "Don't get frightened
in the morning when you wake up.</i>"

11:28.688 --> 11:31.558
<i>There's gonna be a man
sleeping in that thing."</i>

11:31.608 --> 11:33.778
Brooks: <i>I went to sleep
at about 2:00 or 3:00</i>

11:33.819 --> 11:35.649
<i>in the morning,
which I normally do.</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:38.905
<i>I was sound asleep
at 6:00 in the morning when...</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:41.239
He's asleep there.
They wake up very early.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.124
Mel Brooks hears,
"Is that the man?"

11:44.162 --> 11:47.372
I said, "That's the man.
That's the man."

11:47.416 --> 11:49.576
"That's not the man."
"That's the man.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.166
He's sleeping."
He says, "Let's see."

11:51.211 --> 11:52.897
And they touch his eye
to see if he's sleeping,

11:52.921 --> 11:54.751
'cause he was
quivering a little.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.338
And he's looking at them.
He's awake. He's awake.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.134
And then I said, "I'm the man."

11:59.177 --> 12:00.857
- <i>"I'm the man," he said.</i>
- "I'm the man."

12:03.140 --> 12:04.810
<i>They were sweet kids.
They woke me up.</i>

12:04.850 --> 12:06.180
But it was very kind of Carl.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.556
You know this is 61 years ago

12:07.602 --> 12:08.802
- you're talking about?
- Yeah.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.203
Reiner: <i>This isn't a story
about looking back.</i>

12:21.741 --> 12:24.491
<i>But on the other hand,
by the time you reach 90,</i>

12:24.536 --> 12:27.246
<i>you've seen and done
a hell of a lot...</i>

12:29.374 --> 12:31.794
<i>and you're lucky
if you still have friends</i>

12:31.835 --> 12:34.245
<i>who remember those times.</i>

12:36.423 --> 12:40.383
<i>One of my oldest friends is
an Army buddy... Stan Harper.</i>

13:05.952 --> 13:08.622
Reiner: <i>He plays the classics...</i>

13:08.663 --> 13:11.413
<i>Bach, Beethoven, Mozart.</i>

13:15.086 --> 13:17.376
<i>He played with
every major orchestra</i>

13:17.422 --> 13:19.672
<i>throughout the world.</i>

13:19.716 --> 13:21.546
<i>Just a year ago,
he was celebrated</i>

13:21.593 --> 13:24.183
<i>by a thousand
other harmonica players</i>

13:24.221 --> 13:27.221
<i>for being the world's
greatest harmonica player.</i>

13:31.561 --> 13:34.061
Harper:
<i>My favorite things in life?</i>

13:34.105 --> 13:38.225
Well, number one,
it's called breathing.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.606
That's the prime thing.

13:50.288 --> 13:54.208
When I was about 10 years of
age, walking out in the street,

13:54.251 --> 13:57.171
I found a harmonica
near the curb.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.340
I locked myself in the bathroom
with it for five hours.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.474
When I came out,
I could play the thing.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.179
<i>I went into show business.</i>

14:09.224 --> 14:11.394
I was, like, 12 years of age

14:11.434 --> 14:14.814
when I left home
and went out on the road.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.814
<i>I used to lie about my age.</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:24.861
<i>My harmonica band did the movie
"One-Third of a Nation"</i>

14:24.906 --> 14:27.156
<i>with Sylvia Sidney
and Leif Erickson.</i>

14:34.874 --> 14:36.624
<i>I was 14 years old.</i>

14:45.176 --> 14:49.346
<i>When the war got going
and the Japanese attacked,</i>

14:49.389 --> 14:52.519
<i>I wanted to join the Army.</i>

14:52.559 --> 14:54.679
They started
this entertainment unit,

14:54.728 --> 14:55.808
a special unit...

14:58.690 --> 15:00.480
<i>that had some
of the greatest talents</i>

15:00.525 --> 15:02.855
that were ever gathered
in one place.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.324
<i>There were maybe nine of us</i>

15:08.366 --> 15:09.816
who were formerly
in show business,

15:09.868 --> 15:12.908
music arrangers, musicians,
and a comic.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.121
<i>We did shows.</i>

15:16.166 --> 15:19.456
<i>We did the costumes,
everything... direction.</i>

15:19.502 --> 15:24.212
<i>And it was just a marvelous
group of people.</i>

15:24.257 --> 15:26.377
And that's where I met
Carl Reiner.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.175
<i>It's a funny thing about people.</i>

15:30.221 --> 15:32.101
You could meet somebody,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.390
and you get a feeling
about them.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.604
I had this feeling
when I met Carl.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.056
He was a good human being.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.108
<i>What keeps me going
are different friends</i>

15:44.152 --> 15:47.072
<i>that I've had in my life
that I think back.</i>

15:47.113 --> 15:50.073
Carl and I were friends
all the way through.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.656
He was such a sweet guy,
and he came out one day

15:53.703 --> 15:58.083
<i>just walking around with a
dog leash with no dog in it.</i>

15:59.834 --> 16:01.544
<i>I laughed like crazy.</i>

16:06.675 --> 16:08.125
Buettner:
<i>The best science tells us</i>

16:08.176 --> 16:10.466
that the capacity
of the human body...

16:10.512 --> 16:14.262
My body, your body...
Is about 90 years,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.267
little bit more for women,

16:17.310 --> 16:21.310
but life expectancy
in this country is only 78.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.896
So somewhere along the line,

16:22.941 --> 16:26.901
we're leaving about
12 good years on the table.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.116
<i>We think the best way
to get these missing years</i>

16:33.159 --> 16:35.199
<i>is to look at the cultures
around the world</i>

16:35.245 --> 16:38.035
<i>that are actually
experiencing them...</i>

16:38.081 --> 16:41.251
<i>Places like Sardinia,
Icaria, and Okinawa.</i>

16:41.292 --> 16:44.172
<i>The older you get,
the more celebrated you are.</i>

16:44.212 --> 16:46.922
<i>When you hit 60, 70, 80, 90,</i>

16:46.965 --> 16:51.675
you're not only expected
to get up and enjoy your life,

16:51.720 --> 16:53.510
you're expected to contribute.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.805
<i>The people around them
have said,</i>

16:55.849 --> 16:57.219
<i>"You matter.</i>

16:57.267 --> 17:00.137
<i>We want you to stay engaged."</i>

17:00.186 --> 17:03.516
<i>If you feel like you're needed,
you rise to the occasion.</i>

17:03.565 --> 17:07.724
<i>Having a reason to get up
in the morning is important.</i>

17:07.777 --> 17:11.857
<i>About 40% of how happy
or not you are</i>

17:11.906 --> 17:13.945
<i>is driven by genes,</i>

17:13.992 --> 17:19.291
<i>about 15% is driven
by circumstances in life,</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:22.869
<i>but then about 40% or so
is up to you.</i>

17:22.916 --> 17:24.747
If you're dealt a crappy hand

17:24.794 --> 17:28.554
when it comes to your outlook
in life or your optimism,

17:28.590 --> 17:32.130
you can always better your hand
by doing a number of things.

17:32.177 --> 17:36.177
And I'm not a big believer
in positive psychology,

17:36.222 --> 17:40.852
but I am a big believer that
you can shape your environment

17:40.894 --> 17:46.154
to stack the deck in favor
of a better life at any age.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.700
Ida Keeling: <i>I don't never
consider myself old, never did.</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:03.918
<i>I love a challenge.</i>

18:06.377 --> 18:10.547
<i>If you don't take care
of yourself, nobody else will.</i>

18:12.175 --> 18:14.925
You've got to be
the boss of your body.

18:26.689 --> 18:30.779
<i>At the age of 67,
I started running</i>

18:30.819 --> 18:34.739
because I was down in the dumps
over the death of my sons.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.118
Shelley Keeling:
<i>My brothers were enticed</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:43.200
by some of the evils

18:43.248 --> 18:45.538
that are on the street.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.253
Ida: <i>They got into
the drug thing.</i>

18:50.547 --> 18:52.047
Shelley:
<i>You raise your children,</i>

18:52.090 --> 18:54.090
<i>but there's always
a force out there</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:55.553
<i>that is competing with you</i>

18:55.593 --> 18:58.263
for your child's attention,
for their soul,

18:58.304 --> 19:02.934
<i>and my brothers fell victim
to those temptations.</i>

19:02.976 --> 19:05.766
<i>One was murdered, and then two
years eight months later,</i>

19:05.812 --> 19:07.692
<i>the other one was murdered.</i>

19:07.730 --> 19:09.560
Ida: <i>My sons was murdered</i>

19:09.607 --> 19:12.897
<i>so close together, both of 'em.</i>

19:12.944 --> 19:14.744
<i>That was finished for me,</i>

19:14.779 --> 19:19.199
<i>and I was just so depressed
at that time.</i>

19:19.242 --> 19:21.782
Shelley: <i>My mother was
just sinking so fast,</i>

19:21.828 --> 19:24.998
and I said to her,
"Mom, you had four children,"

19:25.039 --> 19:26.789
but I have one mother.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.423
<i>"You have to get up,
and you have to keep living."</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:31.590
Ida: <i>I just couldn't
get myself together</i>

19:31.629 --> 19:35.129
until my daughter asked me
to go on a mini-run.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.680
<i>I said, "Well, okay,"
so I went on the mini-run.</i>

19:42.015 --> 19:44.265
Come to find out it was a 5K.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.872
Shelley: <i>I told her, "Just run.
Just get in and run."</i>

19:47.896 --> 19:50.766
<i>She was 67 and she competed,</i>

19:50.815 --> 19:53.895
<i>and when she finished the race,
she said that she felt</i>

19:53.943 --> 19:57.193
<i>like a great burden
had been lifted off of her.</i>

19:57.238 --> 19:59.948
When I came back,
I felt so different.

19:59.991 --> 20:03.331
I felt sort of
I had come out of a shell.

20:03.369 --> 20:07.539
Shelley: <i>So thereafter, we
raced, like, every week.</i>

20:07.582 --> 20:10.212
Ida: <i>Long Island and Brooklyn</i>

20:10.251 --> 20:14.001
<i>and Jersey and Georgia.</i>

20:14.047 --> 20:17.087
Shelley: <i> At 80 years old, she did
the World Athletic Veterans Games</i>

20:17.133 --> 20:19.093
<i>that was in Buffalo, New York,</i>

20:19.135 --> 20:21.135
and she finished third
for the U.S.A.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.313
Ida: <i>What I like about running...
the best exercise out there.</i>

20:27.352 --> 20:29.692
<i>It just moves everything.</i>

20:31.272 --> 20:34.822
When the gun go off, pow...
Whew... you gone.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.494
<i>In the apartment,
I work out on my bike,</i>

20:41.532 --> 20:45.372
<i>and I got weights,
and I do that every day</i>

20:45.411 --> 20:50.541
<i>for at least a half-hour
and sometimes a whole hour.</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:54.593
<i>Rather than go to a doctor,
I'd rather exercise.</i>

20:56.631 --> 21:01.881
<i>I believe in eat for
nutrition, not for taste.</i>

21:01.928 --> 21:04.428
<i>Like too much salt, sugar,
a bunch of grease,</i>

21:04.472 --> 21:06.682
just everything
that tastes good,

21:06.724 --> 21:08.184
no good.

21:08.226 --> 21:12.266
<i>And the other thing is
do what you need to do,</i>

21:12.313 --> 21:14.273
<i>not what you want to do.</i>

21:16.234 --> 21:18.944
<i>Now I'm chasing myself.</i>

21:18.987 --> 21:20.857
There's nobody to compete with.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.367
Announcer:
<i>We're here at Franklin Field</i>

21:24.409 --> 21:27.329
<i>for the 2016 Penn Relays.</i>

21:27.370 --> 21:29.040
Shelley: <i>Recently, Mom competed</i>

21:29.080 --> 21:31.620
<i>in the largest track meet
in the country.</i>

21:33.251 --> 21:37.591
<i>All the media
were there... ABC, NBC.</i>

21:37.630 --> 21:42.260
Announcer: <i> In lane three, here
is Ida Keeling, 100 years old.</i>

21:46.389 --> 21:48.139
Shelley: <i>When you think
about the sorrow.</i>

21:48.182 --> 21:51.812
<i>Mom had to overcome to get here,</i>

21:51.853 --> 21:54.483
<i>and now thousands of people
were cheering for her.</i>

21:54.522 --> 21:57.442
Announcer:
<i>The crowd is on their feet.</i>

21:57.483 --> 22:01.243
Shelley: <i>And millions more
were watching her on the news.</i>

22:01.279 --> 22:04.949
Announcer:
<i>100 meters at 100 years old.</i>

22:04.991 --> 22:07.911
Shelley: <i>It just makes
me feel so proud of her.</i>

22:07.952 --> 22:11.162
Ida: <i>My goal is to
just keep running</i>

22:11.205 --> 22:16.625
<i>and to hope always that I'd be
some encouragement to others</i>

22:16.669 --> 22:18.959
and just feel strong
and stay strong.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.920
<i>You've got to have the will.</i>

22:22.967 --> 22:25.677
<i>Where there's a will,
there's a way,</i>

22:25.720 --> 22:28.510
and if you got the will, you gonna
find a way, and that is no lie.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.889
Michael Schlesinger:
<i>And here he comes now.</i>

22:51.913 --> 22:54.373
Ladies and gentlemen,
the true Renaissance man

22:54.415 --> 22:57.785
of American comedy,
Mr. Carl Reiner.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.296
I am 93 years old,

23:04.342 --> 23:07.182
and this may be
my last interview.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.302
Rowan?

23:32.120 --> 23:35.450
Jerry Seinfeld: <i>I first met Carl
Reiner when I was a little kid</i>

23:35.498 --> 23:38.078
at a show in Westbury,
Long Island,

23:38.126 --> 23:40.126
where Alan King was performing.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.459
<i>My parents took me to the show.</i>

23:42.505 --> 23:45.545
And as we were leaving,
I ran off

23:45.591 --> 23:49.801
and found the dressing room
where Alan King was.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.846
And there was Alan King,
and I had the program,

23:51.889 --> 23:53.559
and I got his autograph.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.160
And Alan King says,
"Do you know who this man is?"

23:55.184 --> 23:56.984
And it was Carl Reiner.
I says, "Yeah",

23:57.019 --> 23:59.439
that's Carl Reiner
from 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'"

23:59.480 --> 24:01.810
And I got his autograph, too.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.899
<i>20 years later, I had become
a stand-up comedian,</i>

24:06.946 --> 24:09.196
and I was doing
this HBO special,

24:09.240 --> 24:11.030
and we needed somebody
to introduce me.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.825
I've seen the show
that we're about to see now,

24:13.870 --> 24:15.700
and I know the work
that went into it,

24:15.746 --> 24:18.746
and I know how brilliant it is,
and it would make me sick

24:18.791 --> 24:21.421
if you flipped those channels
while this show is on,

24:21.460 --> 24:23.210
so I'm going to have to ask you

24:23.254 --> 24:25.464
to please give me
your remote controls.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.796
I'm gonna have to ask you
to confiscate them, please.

24:27.842 --> 24:31.262
May I have your remote controls?

24:31.304 --> 24:34.564
Seinfeld: <i>Carl very
graciously offered to do it.</i>

24:34.599 --> 24:37.099
And at that time,
I didn't even recall

24:37.143 --> 24:40.023
that I had this autograph
from 20 years earlier.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.612
Yeah?

24:42.648 --> 24:45.148
Seinfeld: <i>So, I did the pilot
for "Seinfeld" in '89.</i>

24:45.193 --> 24:46.733
<i>We shot the pilot</i>

24:46.777 --> 24:49.567
on the same stage
as "The Dick Van Dyke Show."

24:49.614 --> 24:51.324
Boy, the Mets
blew it tonight, huh?

24:51.365 --> 24:54.115
Oh! What are you doing?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.990
Kessler, it's a tape!

24:56.037 --> 24:58.537
Seinfeld: <i>Carl came
down to wish us luck.</i>

24:58.581 --> 25:00.081
And even then, I hadn't recalled

25:00.124 --> 25:03.004
that I had this autograph
in my drawer

25:03.044 --> 25:04.674
and kept all these years.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.842
Reiner: <i> Hello.</i>

25:07.882 --> 25:09.632
- Seinfeld: <i>Carl?
- Yeah.</i>

25:09.675 --> 25:11.125
<i>- It's Jerry.
- Oh, Jerry, yes.</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:12.887
<i>How are you?</i>

25:12.929 --> 25:15.849
So then we jump forward to 2014.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.560
What do you think of it so far?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.930
- It is quite beautiful.
- As a car, it's horrible.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.517
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

25:21.562 --> 25:24.522
But it's a nice
living room with wheels.

25:24.565 --> 25:29.435
Seinfeld: <i>Carl agreed to be on my
new little experimental program</i>

25:29.487 --> 25:31.527
<i>called "Comedians in Cars
Getting Coffee,"</i>

25:31.572 --> 25:34.072
which was my valentine

25:34.116 --> 25:36.156
to the life of being a comedian.

25:36.202 --> 25:40.252
I saw Alan King do two hours
of the most brilliant stuff

25:40.289 --> 25:42.209
on his family, his brothers.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.290
I met you at an Alan King show

25:44.335 --> 25:45.625
at the Westbury Music Fair.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.590
That's it! That's the time.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.420
<i>I only saw him one time
my whole life.</i>

25:49.465 --> 25:51.585
- That's...
- I was eight years old.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.304
Seinfeld:
<i>And that's when it hit me,</i>

25:53.344 --> 25:55.144
<i>right in the middle
of chatting with him,</i>

25:55.179 --> 25:58.179
and I kept that program
my whole life.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.064
I still have it, because it
was so valuable to me.

26:02.770 --> 26:06.860
<i>Westbury Music Fair
1967 program.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:09.359
There's Alan King,

26:09.402 --> 26:13.572
and then there was another guy
in that dressing room,

26:13.614 --> 26:16.204
<i>and I got his autograph, too.</i>

26:18.577 --> 26:20.867
Schlesinger: <i>Now, you've
been busy writing books.</i>

26:20.913 --> 26:24.253
Yes, and it's called, "Why and When
'The Dick Van Dyke Show' Was Born."

26:24.292 --> 26:25.832
There are great,
great pictures in it.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.626
The genesis
of "The Dick Van Dyke Show"

26:28.671 --> 26:31.711
was a show I had written
called "Head of the Family."

26:31.757 --> 26:33.717
Your son dislikes you.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.009
What are you saying?

26:35.052 --> 26:37.262
How can he dislike me?
I'm his father.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.241
Some children have been known
to hate their fathers.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.215
He's only six years old.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.677
He doesn't know me
long enough to hate me.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.228
Reiner: <i>One summer,
I wrote a pilot,</i>

26:46.272 --> 26:49.982
and Peter Lawford picked up
the money for the pilot,

26:50.026 --> 26:53.776
and he said, "Send a copy of
it to Joseph P. Kennedy."

26:53.821 --> 26:56.201
That's the head
of the Kennedy clan.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.280
And I said, "Why would I
have to send it to him?"

26:58.326 --> 27:00.236
He says, "Well,
it's Kennedy money."

27:00.286 --> 27:03.616

ethics and the morals are..."

27:05.499 --> 27:07.539
I says, "Joseph P. Kennedy"

27:07.585 --> 27:09.875
is gonna be an arbiter
of my ethics?"

27:11.589 --> 27:14.209
<i>Anyway, "Head of the Family"
didn't work.</i>

27:14.258 --> 27:17.968
It was okay. I shoved it
aside, but I had 13 episodes,

27:18.012 --> 27:21.352
and it bothered people,
my agent especially,

27:21.390 --> 27:24.060
that they were gold to be mined.

27:24.101 --> 27:28.061
And he gave the scripts
to Sheldon Leonard.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.265
<i>So, he said,
"We love these 13 scripts."</i>

27:31.317 --> 27:35.777
And I said, "Sheldon, I don't want to
fail with the same material twice."

27:35.821 --> 27:39.111
And I... by the way, this is a
pretty good impression of him.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.488
He said, "You won't fail."

27:41.535 --> 27:44.115
We'll get a better actor
to play you."

27:46.290 --> 27:47.750
And he did.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.712
He suggested Dick...
He suggested Dick Van Dyke,

27:50.753 --> 27:53.343
and the rest is... is my history.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.023
Reiner: <i>If you want to
talk about vitality,</i>

28:08.062 --> 28:10.482

28:54.024 --> 28:56.534
You know, the best thing
about show business

28:56.569 --> 29:01.109
is the memories you have of people
you work with who tickle you.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.947
I mean, you go to work
and you laugh.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.344
- Oh, yeah.
- What's better than that?

29:04.368 --> 29:05.868
Hi there. Remember me?

29:05.911 --> 29:07.041
Hi.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.542
Hi, Alan. Uh, Alan,

29:10.583 --> 29:12.123
whatever you were
gonna say to Laura,

29:12.168 --> 29:13.998
I would rather you said to me.

29:14.044 --> 29:17.634
Okay, Rob, if that's
the way you want it.

29:17.673 --> 29:21.223
Everybody says, "What was it about
the show that makes it last?"

29:21.260 --> 29:23.930
I said, "We told the
truth about ourselves",

29:23.971 --> 29:25.601
and everybody's similar."

29:25.639 --> 29:28.719
<i>They have lovely times
with their family,</i>

29:28.767 --> 29:30.517
<i>tough times with their...</i>

29:30.561 --> 29:32.521
But if you write
about who you are,

29:32.563 --> 29:34.353
you're not that different
than anybody else.

29:34.398 --> 29:35.648
Of course not.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.441
You may be taller,
funnier-looking,

29:37.485 --> 29:39.435
handsomer, like you are.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.447
What happened to this guy?

29:41.489 --> 29:43.779
He got all gray.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.954
Oh, my God.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.333
You got a book coming out.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.199
A publisher asked me
to write a book

29:49.246 --> 29:52.826
about growing old or how to grow
old correctly or something,

29:52.875 --> 29:55.375
and I said,
"It'll be a thin volume...

29:55.419 --> 29:56.459
Keep moving."

29:56.504 --> 29:58.054
You know, that's about it.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.758
But I did finish it,
and it's coming out in print.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.509
I put at the beginning
how I started exercising.

30:03.552 --> 30:06.552
It was... I was
in a Broadway show,

30:06.597 --> 30:10.017
and I went down
one day between shows.

30:10.059 --> 30:14.019
Under the stage, all the dancers had
all kind of exercise equipment,

30:14.063 --> 30:15.523
so I joined them.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.154
I got back to the dressing room,

30:17.191 --> 30:19.691
and I was kind of
pumped up, you know.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.775
"Hey, this is all right."
So I started doing it.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.827
<i>But my motives changed.</i>

30:29.870 --> 30:32.500
<i>At 30, I exercised to look good.</i>

30:32.540 --> 30:35.210
<i>In my 50s,
I exercised to stay fit.</i>

30:35.251 --> 30:39.041
<i>In my 70s, I exercised
to stay ambulatory.</i>

30:39.088 --> 30:40.548
<i>- Yes.
- In my 80s,</i>

30:40.589 --> 30:43.049
I exercised to avoid
assisted living.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.722
- Who wouldn't?
- <i>And in my 90s,</i>

30:44.760 --> 30:46.390
it's just gonna be
out of defiance.

30:52.268 --> 30:55.268
People are
scared to death of age.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.352
That's one of the purposes
of this book,

30:57.398 --> 30:58.978
that... don't fear it.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.404
You know, meet it head-on.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.572
<i>But things become harder.</i>

31:02.611 --> 31:04.321
<i>There's no doubt about that.</i>

31:04.363 --> 31:07.993
<i>I have people who say
to me, "You look good."</i>

31:08.033 --> 31:11.293
Nobody, when I was 30,
said, "You look good."

31:11.328 --> 31:14.408
What they mean is,
"You don't look dead."

31:14.456 --> 31:16.866
<i>I love having somewhere to go.</i>

31:16.917 --> 31:18.287
<i>It has never been work to me.</i>

31:18.335 --> 31:19.705
<i>It's play.</i>

31:21.338 --> 31:23.588
<i>What is the biblical admonition?</i>

31:23.632 --> 31:28.142
When you grow up, you know, set
aside the things of childhood.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.968
It doesn't mean imagination
and creativity and dreaming.

31:32.016 --> 31:34.806
In my business,
imagination is everything.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.860
Thanks for coming.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.900
Hi.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.823
Dick: <i>Living in the present
is really all you have.</i>

32:28.864 --> 32:30.534
<i>So what do the Buddhists say?</i>

32:30.574 --> 32:33.084
<i>You need someone to love

Boy, he's got it down.

32:43.671 --> 32:46.631
I think I'm faking vitality.

32:46.674 --> 32:48.424
- He's got vitality.
- Yeah.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.257
He drives. He goes to New York.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.092
He goes back. He's amazing.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.023
Lear: <i>I like living
in the moment.</i>

32:58.060 --> 33:00.390
<i>I think there are two words</i>

33:00.437 --> 33:03.187
that we don't understand
the importance of,

33:03.232 --> 33:05.572
little words...
"over" and "next."

33:08.070 --> 33:10.450
<i>When something is over,
it's over,</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:13.159
<i>and then comes next.</i>

33:13.200 --> 33:16.620
If there was a hammock in the
middle between over and next,

33:16.662 --> 33:19.162
that would be what they mean
by living in the moment.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.133
<i>I think the culture
stereotypes everything.</i>

33:24.169 --> 33:27.629
<i>Because I'm 93, I'm supposed
to behave a certain way.</i>

33:29.883 --> 33:31.263
Morning.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.431
<i>The fact that I can
touch my toes</i>

33:33.470 --> 33:36.970
shouldn't be
so amazing to people

33:37.015 --> 33:42.435
if the culture really understood
what it is to be older

33:42.479 --> 33:46.189
and didn't make such a big
fuss about it or fear of it.

33:46.233 --> 33:49.483
Here is a copy
of Norman's schedule,

33:49.528 --> 33:52.318
<i>Lynn's schedule.</i>

33:52.364 --> 33:56.284
Lear: <i>But in a way, I am the
age of whoever I'm talking to.</i>

33:56.326 --> 33:58.906
I'm the peer
of whoever I'm talking to.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.544
If I'm talking
to a 50-year-old, I'm 50.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.962
When I talk
to a 12-year-old, I'm 12.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.631
Yeah, we're going off
the same agenda of lists,

34:06.670 --> 34:08.920
<i>but it's now on the
bottom of page two.</i>

34:08.964 --> 34:11.264
Lear: <i>Netflix has
ordered 13 episodes</i>

34:11.300 --> 34:15.010
of a Latina version of a show
I did 30 years ago

34:15.053 --> 34:16.853
called "One Day at a Time."

34:20.976 --> 34:23.476
<i>There are no cons of being 93.</i>

34:23.520 --> 34:25.730
<i>They're all pros.</i>

34:25.773 --> 34:28.193
Just being alive is a glory.

<i>The world is a fabulous place.</i>

<i>And as long as you meet

35:20.744 --> 35:23.794
hold on to them,

35:23.831 --> 35:25.911
because they're gifts.

35:34.383 --> 35:37.683
Norman Lear commandeered,
or got, a house

35:37.719 --> 35:40.679
that had five bedrooms
and single-handedly,

35:40.722 --> 35:44.682
or maybe double-handedly,
is responsible for five couples

35:44.726 --> 35:48.806
<i>having the best three
weekends in our lives.</i>

35:50.774 --> 35:52.484
Lear: <i>I remember a
couple of weekends</i>

35:52.526 --> 35:54.356
<i>where we got up
on Saturday morning</i>

35:54.403 --> 35:55.823
<i>in bedclothes. We had breakfast.</i>

35:55.863 --> 35:57.653
We never got out
of the bedclothes.

35:57.698 --> 36:00.818
Reiner: <i>We called the club
that we had "Yenemvelt."</i>

36:00.868 --> 36:04.038
My mother used to talk about
Yenemvelt, meaning the other world.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.579
In other words, something good

36:05.622 --> 36:07.267
was gonna happen to you,
but it won't be here.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.791
"We're too poor.
It'll happen in Yenemvelt."

36:11.295 --> 36:13.335
<i>And we had a song.</i>

36:13.380 --> 36:15.775
Now let's see if we can remember the song.
It's very difficult.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.485
- Reiner: <i>It's a very difficult...</i>
- The lyric...

36:17.509 --> 36:21.679
♪ O Yenemvelt, O Yenemvelt ♪

36:21.722 --> 36:26.102

36:48.332 --> 36:50.252
I'm asking you, sir,
how song came...

36:50.292 --> 36:52.002
So, song came about
when you really

36:52.044 --> 36:53.794
had to communicate,
but you were in trouble.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.627

37:13.982 --> 37:16.942
Vitality is the intersection

37:16.985 --> 37:21.485
of long life and active life.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.409
<i>It's not only
living a long time,</i>

37:27.454 --> 37:30.414
but it's living
in an engaged way,

37:30.457 --> 37:33.497
where you're actually enjoying
it and not just showing up.

37:35.212 --> 37:38.092
<i>Number one, you're still
physically fit.</i>

37:42.219 --> 37:45.549
Number two, you're still
cognitively aware.

37:48.558 --> 37:51.938
Number three, you're
living out your passions

37:51.979 --> 37:53.559
and living out your values.

37:56.149 --> 37:58.019
<i>Number four,
you're contributing.</i>

37:58.068 --> 38:00.358
You're feeling
a sense of contribution.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.324
And, five,
that you have a feeling

38:02.364 --> 38:04.574
of ongoing achievement
in your life.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.590
Porchon-Lynch: <i>I did yoga for the
first time when I was eight.</i>

38:27.973 --> 38:31.433
<i>I saw a group of boys
on the beach in India,</i>

38:31.476 --> 38:33.726
<i>and they were doing yoga.</i>

38:33.770 --> 38:36.560
And I thought,
"That's a wonderful new game,"

38:36.606 --> 38:38.606
and they let me
join in with them.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.028
<i>And I went and told my aunt,</i>

38:42.070 --> 38:44.200
and she said,
"Oh, my goodness, Tao."

38:44.239 --> 38:45.739
That's yoga.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.492
"That's not ladylike."

38:47.534 --> 38:50.994
And I said, "Well, if boys
can do it, I can do it."

38:52.497 --> 38:54.037
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

38:54.082 --> 38:57.502
<i>my uncle was a friend

38:57.544 --> 39:00.384
<i>I marched with Gandhi
when I was 12.</i>

39:00.422 --> 39:03.632
I just felt that
if I could do something

39:03.675 --> 39:05.545
just to help people...

39:05.594 --> 39:09.104
Open up, and then just
bring your hands in front,

39:09.139 --> 39:11.929
and then cross them over.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.385
<i>I teach yoga,
'cause I watch people,</i>

39:14.436 --> 39:16.636
<i>and they don't breathe properly,</i>

39:16.688 --> 39:18.768
and I see people suffering.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.725
And just push up.

39:20.776 --> 39:24.066
I wanted to show them
how to breathe correctly.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.362
Inhale, and back to center.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.777
Open the hands.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.907
<i>When I take a breath,</i>

39:31.953 --> 39:34.663
I open the door to my heart.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.456
<i>One day,
it was snowing like mad,</i>

39:44.508 --> 39:47.588
<i>and the dance students
didn't turn up to dance,</i>

39:47.636 --> 39:50.966
and mine didn't turn up
to do yoga with me,

39:51.014 --> 39:52.894
and so they said to me,
"Do you dance?"

39:52.933 --> 39:54.563
I said, "Only a little bit."

39:55.936 --> 39:59.096
But I do want to go before I die

39:59.147 --> 40:01.647
"to Argentina
to dance the tango."

40:01.691 --> 40:05.491
<i>So they said,
"Why don't you start tonight?"</i>

40:05.529 --> 40:07.649
<i>So, in the middle
of the snowstorm,</i>

40:07.697 --> 40:11.367
I started to dance,
and I haven't stopped since.

40:19.918 --> 40:23.748
<i>A lot of people are asking me
about getting old,</i>

40:23.797 --> 40:27.127
<i>so my answer is this.</i>

40:27.175 --> 40:30.715
<i>Don't sit there thinking
about what you can't do.</i>

40:30.762 --> 40:32.552
<i>When you get up in the morning,</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:36.347
<i>think this is going to be
the best day of your life.</i>

40:36.393 --> 40:39.023
<i>It's the dance of life
within you.</i>

40:39.062 --> 40:42.062
<i>Within us is the power
to do anything.</i>

40:43.942 --> 40:46.652
I was very limber
as a young person.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.105
I could put my feet
behind my head.

40:49.156 --> 40:53.366
That was the first act I ever did
when I was in the first grade.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.240
And for Christmas,
we had to do something.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.747
Somebody sang. Somebody tap danced.
"What can you do?"

40:58.790 --> 41:02.250
I could put both my hands...
Feet behind my head

41:02.294 --> 41:04.674
and walk on my hands.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.713
And I went to other classrooms,

41:06.756 --> 41:09.916
and I did that
for my first performance.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.846
Typically, in America
we've divided

41:14.890 --> 41:18.220
our adult life up
into two sections.

41:18.268 --> 41:21.688
There's our work life,
where we're productive,

41:21.730 --> 41:25.150
and then one day,
boom, we retire.

41:25.192 --> 41:29.692
Reiner: <i> Dan Buettner has five
essential qualities of vitality,</i>

41:29.738 --> 41:33.358

41:51.927 --> 41:56.257

Okay, what are we having today?

a hot brisket sandwich.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.202
Gravy on the side.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.199
- I don't want to be killed.
- Okay.

Finkel: <i>Food is very important,

42:17.285 --> 42:19.945
It gives you the energy
that you need.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.576
And in my profession,
you gotta have energy.

42:22.624 --> 42:23.924
As soon as I get on that stage,

42:23.959 --> 42:25.329
I have all the energy
in the world.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.497
♪ My life's so glamorous... ♪

42:28.546 --> 42:33.466
When I was 90, I did a play
called "Fyvush Finkel Live"

42:33.510 --> 42:35.970
for three weeks,
eight performances a week.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.352
I loved it.

42:37.389 --> 42:38.719
Was sold out, too, you know,

42:38.765 --> 42:40.765
and that made it
even feel better.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.119
- Here we go, my love.
- Here, look at this.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.063
You see what's happening here?

42:44.104 --> 42:47.064
A feast.
So I feel like a king now.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.817
- See?
- And my queen

42:48.858 --> 42:51.108
- is my beautiful waitress here.
- That's right.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.612
When I was 90, I got
very important work.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.775
I did a film
for the Coen Brothers.

42:56.825 --> 43:01.155
David Kelley told me
he's got two new series coming,

43:01.204 --> 43:03.874
that he wants me to appear

<i>I'm ready. I mean, it's
not a big investment,</i>

43:23.059 --> 43:26.729
because it has
an orchestra and myself.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.796
<i>They went to the Catskills,

<i>to the Reveille,

44:00.847 --> 44:02.717
<i>They went to all these places.</i>

"Why did they die?" You ask.

44:12.776 --> 44:14.726
- Why did they die?
- Why did they die?

44:14.778 --> 44:16.778
- I'll tell you why they died.
- Tell me.

44:16.821 --> 44:20.161
What killed them
was they all loved

44:20.200 --> 44:22.330
the song called
"Dancing in the Dark."

44:22.369 --> 44:24.489
- Everybody did.
- Brooks: <i> And they</i> loved it, but...

44:24.537 --> 44:26.907
- Fred Astaire.
- The Jews didn't know

44:26.956 --> 44:30.376
that it was
such a really rangy song.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.748
It was very high.

44:31.795 --> 44:35.295
Here's the way
Crosby sang it in 1931.

on that note.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.719
Many Jews would die.

45:19.759 --> 45:21.379
What you do for this Jew

45:21.428 --> 45:23.178
is just added
six years to my life.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.221
Oh, bless you.

45:24.264 --> 45:26.064
You can't laugh that hard

45:26.099 --> 45:28.309
without... without it
adding time.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.911
I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.

45:29.936 --> 45:31.726
You mean laughing
will keep you alive?

45:31.771 --> 45:33.941
No, while you're alive,
you can laugh.

45:33.982 --> 45:36.272
When you're dead,
the laughter is so difficult.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.187
- But we don't know that.
- So difficult.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.525
When all of us were young,

45:42.574 --> 45:46.534
we probably all enjoyed
reading fairy tales.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.618
I mean very young.

45:48.663 --> 45:51.793
We read stories
about witches and demons

45:51.833 --> 45:56.463
and giants and trolls,
and it was fun.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.054
You get a little bit older,

45:58.089 --> 46:00.169
you can't read
fairy tales anymore.

46:00.216 --> 46:01.666
You're too old.

46:01.718 --> 46:05.338
But then along comes
superhero comic books,

46:05.388 --> 46:07.138
and I think they appeal

46:07.182 --> 46:10.352
to the same part of you
that fairy tales did.

46:16.149 --> 46:20.149
<i>When I was in the Army,
I wrote instructional manuals.</i>

46:20.195 --> 46:21.685
And one day I got a letter

46:21.738 --> 46:24.858
from the commander
of the finance department,

46:24.908 --> 46:29.618
<i>and they were having trouble
because morale was very low.</i>

46:29.662 --> 46:31.162
<i>They weren't heroes.</i>

46:31.206 --> 46:33.496
<i>They were doing payroll forms.</i>

46:33.541 --> 46:37.291
Could I write
a marching song for them

46:37.337 --> 46:39.297
that would lift up
their spirits?

46:41.132 --> 46:45.382
And I wrote a song to the tune
of the Air Force song,

46:45.428 --> 46:48.298
you know, "Off we go
into the wild blue yonder."

46:48.348 --> 46:50.558
So I wrote for them...

46:50.600 --> 46:54.730
♪ Off we go into
our office yonder ♪

46:54.771 --> 46:58.401
♪ At our desks
morning till night ♪

46:58.441 --> 47:02.571
♪ Far away from
any battle's thunder ♪

47:02.612 --> 47:05.072
♪ We pay off
the fellas who fight ♪

47:06.616 --> 47:08.156
<i>♪ Clerks alert ♪</i>

47:08.201 --> 47:10.661
♪ Guarding our books

47:10.703 --> 47:14.043
♪ Payroll forms
clutter the floor ♪

47:14.082 --> 47:18.082
♪ We write, compute,
sit tight to boot ♪

47:18.127 --> 47:22.257
♪ Nothing will stop
the fiscal director! ♪

47:22.298 --> 47:24.128
Well, they loved it,

47:24.175 --> 47:28.675
and they used to march
around the field singing it,

47:28.721 --> 47:30.761
and I got this commendation,

47:30.807 --> 47:33.807
"Thank you for putting
new spirit in their hearts."

47:33.851 --> 47:37.401
And so I really won the war
single-handedly, practically,

47:37.438 --> 47:39.688
'cause without
the payroll people,

47:39.732 --> 47:41.232
the soldiers wouldn't be paid,

47:41.276 --> 47:42.816
and who knows
what would've happened?

47:45.947 --> 47:48.447
<i>I always tried to be with people</i>

47:48.491 --> 47:51.741
who were smarter than I was,
not easy to find.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.696
<i>Then you have
something to try for.</i>

47:54.747 --> 47:57.747
<i>You want to be
as smart as that guy.</i>

47:57.792 --> 48:00.792
I like people who have
great personalities,

48:00.837 --> 48:03.627
people who are fun to
listen to when they talk.

48:03.673 --> 48:05.923
"Hey, wouldn't it be great
if we did this?"

48:05.967 --> 48:09.177
"How about... wouldn't this
make a great movie?"

48:09.220 --> 48:10.720
<i>Some actor said to me,</i>

48:10.763 --> 48:12.723
"Why don't we do
a movie of your life?

48:12.765 --> 48:15.515
I'd love to do
a film of your life."

48:15.560 --> 48:18.940
I said, "Nobody could do my life,
'cause nobody could play me."

48:18.980 --> 48:22.230
"Errol Flynn is dead."

48:22.275 --> 48:24.725
I am pretty energetic,

48:24.777 --> 48:27.107
but not as much as I used to be.

48:27.155 --> 48:29.775
<i>I used to wake up
in the morning,</i>

48:29.824 --> 48:32.454
"Hello, world!"
and I was raring to go.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.953
Now I wake up in the morning,

48:33.995 --> 48:36.035
"Oh, Christ, do I have
to get up so soon?"

48:36.080 --> 48:38.540
<i>I don't know if anybody</i>

48:38.583 --> 48:43.173
has written a book
about what it's like to be old.

48:43.212 --> 48:47.592
Being old is like
a whole new adventure.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.884
You can't describe it
to young people.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.257
There's no way.

48:52.305 --> 48:56.095
I'm like a cowboy who wants
to die with his boots on.

48:56.142 --> 48:58.682
I want to go
in front of my computer

48:58.728 --> 49:00.768
while I'm typing something.

49:12.742 --> 49:15.032
Reiner: <i>The more I looked,
the more I discovered</i>

49:15.078 --> 49:18.368
<i>vibrant, talented people
in their 90s and beyond.</i>

49:25.838 --> 49:28.008
<i>My dear, old friend Betty White</i>

49:28.049 --> 49:31.679
<i>is a comic, actor, an author,</i>

49:31.719 --> 49:36.809
<i>and an animal rights activist,
par excellence.</i>

49:36.849 --> 49:39.849
- Do you know why we're here?
- No.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.444
It's our age.
It's not our beauty.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.439
It's not our talent.
We are over 90.

49:44.482 --> 49:45.732
Who's over 90?

49:45.775 --> 49:48.225
I am. You're still 64?

49:48.277 --> 49:51.947
No. Wait a minute.
I thought I was 60-something.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.569
But you turn that upside
down, and it's 90-something.

49:54.617 --> 49:56.777
That's good. You forgot
to turn it upside down.

49:56.828 --> 49:58.578
I forgot to turn it over.

49:58.621 --> 50:03.461
Anyway, the thing is that my
nephew George has this idea

50:03.501 --> 50:07.291
that people over 90
don't have to retire.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.588
<i>They can do things.</i>

50:08.631 --> 50:10.191
From 90 to 93,
I've been more productive

50:10.216 --> 50:11.756
than I was when I was younger.

50:11.801 --> 50:14.801
I think I have, too,
because it's more fun.

50:14.846 --> 50:16.346
You wrote a book.

50:16.389 --> 50:18.009
Oh, I've written eight books.

50:18.057 --> 50:19.967
Eight books.
But in the last two years?

50:20.017 --> 50:22.727
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's fun,

50:22.770 --> 50:25.940
because you don't
have to do it, and if...

50:25.982 --> 50:30.692
Look, if it doesn't work,
I've had my career.

50:30.737 --> 50:32.897
I'm not gonna worry about it.

50:32.947 --> 50:35.607
But when you say you don't have to
do it, you really have to do it.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.618
- We have to for ourselves.
- Yeah, we have to.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.200
I wake up, and if I don't
have a computer to go to,

50:40.246 --> 50:41.656
I wouldn't know where to go.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.826
But we're blessed,

50:43.875 --> 50:45.455
both of us, with good health.

50:45.501 --> 50:46.831
I think so.

50:46.878 --> 50:49.958
That's the only thing
that I care about, I...

50:50.006 --> 50:52.506
The fact that I can
still walk around the block.

50:52.550 --> 50:56.090
As I sing and walk around the
block, I said, "That's it."

50:56.137 --> 50:58.387
If I didn't have that,
I would be so sad.

50:58.431 --> 51:00.431
Yeah, because you'd be
a burden to people,

51:00.475 --> 51:02.635
and I don't want to be
a burden to anybody,

51:02.685 --> 51:04.765
- except possibly...
- You'll never be a burden.

51:04.812 --> 51:06.957
- Robert Redford...
- Because you'll always be a sunny person.

51:06.981 --> 51:09.571
You're sunny lying
down, I'm sure.

51:09.609 --> 51:10.939
I mean, in bed, you're quiet.

51:10.985 --> 51:13.355
You smile. I know
you're a sunny person.

51:13.404 --> 51:17.664
Yes, I'm a sunny person
lying in bed with a smile.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.200
Oh, no, that's another story.
I'm sorry.

51:20.244 --> 51:23.084
Look how...

51:23.122 --> 51:26.332
Look how you don't lose
your interest in sex,

51:26.375 --> 51:27.955
but you lose your power.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.672
You lose your...

51:29.712 --> 51:31.712
What happened?

51:31.756 --> 51:33.546
Well, we got along fine,

51:33.591 --> 51:37.681
but he wouldn't go downtown,

51:37.720 --> 51:39.430
if you know what I mean.

51:43.392 --> 51:47.062
What? I mean there are
so many good restaurants

51:47.104 --> 51:50.864
- and... and shops down there.
- Oh!

51:52.735 --> 51:54.355
Hi.

51:54.403 --> 51:55.863
Oh, Max.

51:55.905 --> 51:58.775
Listen, Elka.
I don't want to lose you,

51:58.825 --> 52:00.905
so if you're still up for it,

52:00.952 --> 52:04.372
I'm willing to try
going downtown.

I mean, my mom was just born.

55:06.554 --> 55:09.564
I mean, when I think about
those kind of things,

55:09.598 --> 55:13.228
it blows my mind in that
we get along so well.

55:17.690 --> 55:20.020
<i>I slowly would tell
my close friends,</i>

55:20.067 --> 55:22.647

55:33.289 --> 55:36.249

55:41.005 --> 55:42.085
she finally said, "Dick?"

55:42.131 --> 55:44.511
I went, "Yes." "Oh."

55:44.550 --> 55:46.550
And I went,
"Here's this brooch."

I'm her best friend,
and she's my best friend.

56:07.531 --> 56:11.331

model for a huge age difference.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.908
It can work.

56:12.953 --> 56:15.043
I mean, I don't think
just I could get along

56:15.081 --> 56:17.661

man this way.

56:17.708 --> 56:21.628
He's just a very special human
being, no matter how old he is.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.168
Love is the basis of everything,

56:26.217 --> 56:29.007
the key to all enjoyment
of living.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.143
Love... people think
of love as like,

56:31.180 --> 56:33.970
you know, marriage
and their family.

56:34.016 --> 56:36.346
You know,
that's very hard to find,

56:36.393 --> 56:39.563
perfect love, in all these
situations with humans,

56:39.605 --> 56:42.765
but you can find perfect love
in a lot of other places.

56:42.817 --> 56:45.317
Whether you're 9 or 90,

56:45.361 --> 56:49.071

but do it every day.

<i>This is one of the most beautiful

57:24.191 --> 57:27.651
<i>I played all

57:27.695 --> 57:29.815
<i>I did the Eddie Cantor show,</i>

57:29.864 --> 57:32.994
<i>"The Ed Sullivan Show,"
"Kate Smith."</i>

57:33.033 --> 57:36.663
<i>It all happened,
really, in 1946,</i>

57:36.704 --> 57:40.584
when I started to write songs
that became standards,

57:40.624 --> 57:43.504
<i>like "Miami Beach Rumba."</i>

57:43.544 --> 57:46.214
<i>Then I wrote
"Managua Nicaragua"...</i>

57:49.008 --> 57:53.888
<i>which was on the Hit Parade

<i>A man comes in,</i>

58:13.782 --> 58:16.162

playing a Latin song.

58:16.202 --> 58:18.832
He looks at me.

58:18.871 --> 58:23.001
He says, "Hey, you play
like a Cubano."

58:23.042 --> 58:25.542
He thought I was Cuban.

58:25.586 --> 58:28.796
<i>"I said," No, no, I'm not Cuban.</i>

58:28.839 --> 58:31.089

Music, notes...

58:43.520 --> 58:45.520
<i>a creative idea.</i>

58:48.484 --> 58:53.534

"A Latin from Manhattan."

59:00.496 --> 59:04.366

You mentioned fruit.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:07.232
Fruit kept me going
for 140 years once

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:10.481
when I was
on a very strict diet.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.484
Mainly nectarines.
I love that fruit.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.437
It's half a peach, half a plum.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.987
Such a hell of a fruit.
I love it.

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:19.822
- What has been...
- Even a rotten one.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:46.657
<i>to continually create
new things.</i>

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.788
<i>Just don't lose your curiosity.</i>

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:53.673
<i>That's the big thing...
Being curious.</i>

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.790
Once you lose your curiosity,

01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:59.458
you might as well
lie down and die.

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:06.603
Tony Bennett asked me
to give the commencement speech

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.180
at the high school for the performing
arts that he founded in Queens

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:15.268
<i>called the Frank Sinatra School
for the Performing Arts.</i>

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.105
I gave my commencement speech,

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:21.191
which was
my three principles of life.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.568
One is bust your ass.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.735
Whatever you're doing,
bust your ass.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.334
Work as hard
as you possibly can.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.500
<i>My second principle
is pay attention.</i>

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.000
Pay attention to what's
around you all the time.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.673
Appreciate what's around you
all the time.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.883
And my third principle of life
is fall in love.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:45.014
Fall in love, and love
doesn't mean romantic love.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:48.013
I believe fall in love
with your parking space.

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:51.476
And this is something
I kind of got from George Burns.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:54.018
<i>"He would say," This cup
of coffee, I think,</i>

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.522
<i>might be the greatest one
I've ever had."</i>

01:02:56.565 --> 01:03:00.065
It's kind of an old-school
virtue, I think.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.200
I don't know too many
young people that have this.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:05.738
I know a lot of older people
that have it.

01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:15.787
I think getting dressed
is a creative experience,

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.384
and I do it my way.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.099
I'm not really interested
in being current.

01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:26.085
<i>I think if you know who you
are and what your style is,</i>

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.136
you'll always look good.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.682
Can I just tell you?

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.473
I think you're
the coolest person ever,

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:32.887
and you're an icon and awesome.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.400
That's 'cause I'm a
93-year-old cover girl.

01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.395
People ask me
where I get my vitality,

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.945
and to tell you the truth,
I haven't got a clue.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.819
I drag myself around.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.906
I push myself beyond endurance,
but that's how I am.

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.333
<i>I guess the man upstairs
is helping me.</i>

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:58.075
<i>For me, work is great fun.</i>

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.746
I love what I do,
and it's much more interesting

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:03.416
than sitting around
with a bunch of dopey dames.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:06.505
Apfel: <i>Hi. How are you, darling?</i>

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:07.512
Man: Hello, darling.
How are you tonight?

01:04:07.553 --> 01:04:09.263
Nice to see... you're wet.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.104
Apfel: <i>Well, I think
it's common sense</i>

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:15.979
that vitality comes from
your spirit, from your soul.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.939
And if you have friends
and you have interests

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:22.271
and you do things, you're
going to be much more vital

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:25.107
than if you just sit around
and mope and say,

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.863
"Oh, I'm getting old.
I'm getting old."

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.671
<i>I'm very opposed to unnecessary
facial reconstruction.</i>

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.999
I think it's great
if, you know, you're in a fire

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.634
or you have a nose
like Pinocchio.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:46.722
I mean, if God is good to you
and you get some extra years,

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.588
what the devil do you want
to worry about

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:52.045
and try to look younger
and look freaky?

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:54.307
<i>You undergo plastic surgery,</i>

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:57.389
you could come out looking
like a Picasso painting,

01:04:57.436 --> 01:05:00.306
which is not very pretty.

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:03.685
We live in a society
that has made people feel

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:07.744
that aging and getting old
is a dirty, rotten, evil thing.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.029
Everything is anti-aging.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:13.413
<i>Everything that's
sold to women is anti-aging</i>

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:15.292
or make you look younger.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:16.789
<i>Too many people are worried.</i>

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.500
They're so worried
about getting old.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.501
<i>I never think about getting old.</i>

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:24.133
I think that's the worst thing
to think about.

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:26.251
Living life is different
for everybody,

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:29.218
and I think people should just
take advantage of being alive.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:37.521
Reiner: <i>Almost everyone I
talked to about staying vital</i>

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:41.139
<i>said how important it was
to stay healthy,</i>

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:44.268
<i>but good health is a wild card.</i>

01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:48.486
<i>Sometimes eating right
or staying fit isn't enough.</i>

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.988
<i>Is it possible
to enjoy vital life</i>

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:53.411
<i>even with health problems?</i>

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:56.910
<i>I went to see the legendary
Kirk Douglas to find out.</i>

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.872
I can't tell you

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.166
how thrilled I am
to be with you.

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.460
See, you're not
Kirk Douglas to me.

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:08.254
You're Spartacus.
You're Van Gogh.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.338
And what you did with
Spartacus and Dalton Trumbo,

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:14.465
to this day,
I'm still applauding.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.144
Reiner: <i>You did a one-man
show in your 90s</i>

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.935
that was absolutely amazing.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.138
I went to see it here.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:24.728
When was that?
How old were you...

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:30.403
You know, I had a stroke,
and I couldn't talk.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:34.655
Now, what good is an actor
who can't talk?

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.160
What does an actor do
who can't talk?

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:42.254
Wait for silent pictures
to come back.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:46.209
Douglas: <i>So, I did this show</i>

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:49.343
to prove that I could
still function.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:53.761
I didn't have
much physical pain,

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:57.182
but I had something worse...

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:02.062
Depression, deep depression.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:05.442
Now, my wife was a great help.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.480
When I lay in bed
feeling sorry for myself,

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:13.566
she comes in, "Kirk,
get your ass out of bed"

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:16.533
and start working
on your speech therapy."

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:19.695
I had 65 years
with the right woman.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:23.535
The very last moment
of her life, she was 94,

01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:26.372
<i>and she was lying in bed</i>

01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:28.668
and hadn't said a word
in a day or two.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.962
She hadn't eaten or anything,

01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:34.336
hadn't moved,
just barely breathing.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.934
I'm touching her. She's
not reacting to anything.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.010
She's not hearing
or seeing anything.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:42.885
I said, you know, "Let Mom go
out hearing herself sing."

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.604
She's a wonderful jazz singer,

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:47.154
and she has seven... six albums.

01:07:47.189 --> 01:07:49.559
<i>I put one of the album songs on.</i>

01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:51.978
I put "'A' - You're Adorable."

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:55.357
I said, "Play it loud
so Mom can hear herself"

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.985
as she... as she goes."

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.240
<i>♪ A, you're adorable ♪</i>

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.826
<i>♪ B, you're so beautiful ♪</i>

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:08.632
<i>♪ C, you're a cutie
full of charm ♪</i>

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.958
<i>♪ D, you're a darling ♪</i>

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:13.424
<i>♪ And E, you're exciting ♪</i>

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:18.335
<i>♪ And F, you're a feather
in my arms ♪</i>

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:21.216
<i>♪ G, you look good to me... ♪</i>

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.474
And then one of the
hospice nurses says,

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.807
"She has such a
beautiful, sweet voice."

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.272
And Lucas went up
to his mother and said,

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:32.483
"Ma, the nurse said you have
a beautiful, sweet voice."

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:35.145
And Estelle went like this.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.859
She said, "Thank you,"
and passed away.

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.948
She heard everything
we were doing.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.082
That's the way I want to go.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:50.584
When my mother died,

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.417
I was holding her hand.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.634
Her eyes were closed,

01:08:57.676 --> 01:09:00.466
and then she opened her eyes

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.551
and looked at my face,

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:07.017
and she says, "Don't be scared."

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.640
- "It happens to everyone."
- Oh.

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:12.148
<i>♪ It's fun to wander through ♪</i>

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.569
<i>♪ The alphabet with you ♪</i>

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.819
<i>♪ To tell you
what you mean to me. ♪</i>

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:30.706
When I wake up in the morning,
I never feel good.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.960
When I open my eyes
in the morning,

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.752
when I'm lying down in bed,

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.916
the first thing I feel
is a deep depression.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.546
All I think about
is what I have to do today,

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.095
and I don't think I can do it,

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.810
and I don't feel good
about myself,

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.060
and things are not good.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:54.064
That's my first thought
every morning.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.357
And as soon as I get out of bed,

01:09:56.401 --> 01:10:00.611
the second I am upright,
it's all gone.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:04.405
I go from feeling bad
to feeling great.

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:05.871
The second you get out of bed,

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:07.411
even if you're
just washing your face,

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:09.454
now at least
I'm doing something.

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:12.077
And if you're doing something,
your life is good.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:14.575
If you're doing nothing,
your life stinks.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:17.378
Life is action.
There's nothing else to it.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.716
Martin: <i>Physically,
parachuting is not hard.</i>

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:29.099
<i>All you have to do
is make up your mind</i>

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.982
<i>you're gonna go out the door.</i>

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:35.436
<i>There's nothing to it that way.</i>

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:38.442
<i>Now, all these skydivers
you see,</i>

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:40.685
<i>they get what's called a rush.</i>

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.237
<i>I don't feel a rush.</i>

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.660
<i>I feel a little bit
of apprehension</i>

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.909
<i>when I'm standing in the door,</i>

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:51.042
<i>but I don't get this adrenaline
rush that these people have.</i>

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.911
<i>I don't need that.</i>

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:54.708
<i>I didn't do it for that.</i>

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:03.338
I was in the 506
Parachute Infantry Regiment.

01:11:03.385 --> 01:11:06.335
<i>I told the guys in the unit,
when I get out,</i>

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:08.968
what I want to do
is buy 50 acres of ground,

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:12.725
get a job that I can
support my family,

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.099
and go down and get a
hamburger once in a while,

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.726
and do whatever I want.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.113
Well, I did that.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:22.737
<i>My wife and I built
our own house.</i>

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.529
<i>And when I say we built it,</i>

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:27.032
I don't mean we hired somebody
and told them what to do.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.275
<i>We dug the footers.
We mixed all the concrete.</i>

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:31.407
<i>We did the whole damn works.</i>

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.995
<i>I still do hard work.</i>

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.882
<i>We heat with wood,
and I cut and split the wood.</i>

01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:43.264
Now, I built
this splitter in 1970,

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.919
and it's been used ever since.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.850
<i>The age part is nothing.</i>

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.811
<i>I don't feel any different today</i>

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:55.982
<i>than I did
when I was 25 years old.</i>

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:58.475
<i>That's about a fifth</i>

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.863
of what I'll burn
for the winter,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.940
<i>so I got a lot more to cut yet.</i>

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:08.027
People ask me what contributed
to my living a long time,

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.744
and I said, "Well, here it is..."

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:12.664
No tobacco, no alcohol,
and lots of good sex."

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.503
<i>This is the best part
of my life.</i>

01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:26.169
<i>I get up in the morning
when I want to.</i>

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:28.427
<i>I go to bed when I want to.</i>

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:37.731
<i>To me, vitality means that
you can do whatever you want</i>

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:40.611
<i>regardless of what
the clock says.</i>

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.329
<i>I'm completely free.</i>

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.751
<i>I don't owe anybody a dime.</i>

01:12:57.791 --> 01:12:59.961
<i>Hell, it's a wonderful life.</i>

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.881
<i>Anybody can do it if they want.</i>

01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.841
<i>There's nothing like it.</i>

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.972
Dick: <i>New experiences
are the only thing</i>

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:17.726
<i>you can collect in life
that end up being worth it.</i>

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.494
Yeah, we're with Mr. Dick
Van Dyke and company.

01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:36.536
Dick: <i>Peter Von Lesbian.</i>

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.409
Oh, say...

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.206
- Dick: <i> You like that?</i>
- I'm using that.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:01.937
- Marvin Gaye.
- Here's Nat King Cole.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.060
- There's Dean Martin.
- Dean Martin.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.647
Stevie Wonder.

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:09.130
- Dick: <i>Together,</i> we got almost everyone.
<i>- I know.</i>

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:10.404
- How are you?
- Just great.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.674
- Good to see you. Hi.
- Arlene: Hi.

01:14:11.698 --> 01:14:13.217
- How are you, Arlene?
- Good. How are you?

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.911
I watched them build
this building,

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.781
but I've never
been inside of it.

01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:19.868
- You did?
- Yeah. I remember when they built it.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.934
Terry Wollman: <i> Have you been
in "A" before, in this room?</i>

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.936
- I've never been in this building, ever.
- You've never...

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.688
I thought you had redone,
like, some recording here.

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:27.552
- No.
- Oh, this is so cool.

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:29.259
- And you haven't been here either?
- No.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:33.509
I've never recorded
a song or music.

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:35.723
This is a totally new
experience for me.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.677
Arlene: <i>And then at Capitol
Records my first time is crazy.</i>

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:47.146
We're using
the Frank mic on you.

01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:48.442
Frank as in Frank Sinatra.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.034
- Oh, really?
- The same mic.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.199
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.</i>

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.278
Okay, here we go.

Schlesinger: One final question.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.800
At your age, do you worry a
lot about peer pressure?

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.721
No. No, but I do...

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:50.885
I do think about
how am I gonna go.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.975
And every once in a while if I feel
a little, you know, not too well,

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.311
I'll say, "Is this the end
of Rico?" That's from...

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:05.276
Reiner: <i>There's a story that
I sometimes like to tell.</i>

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:08.164
<i>It's a good one, gets laughs.</i>

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:13.292

I'll have breakfast.

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:23.007
Reiner: <i>But, you know, I
have another obituary story.</i>

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.390
A woman passed away
today at 111.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:27.759
It was very heartening.

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:30.965
She was at the San Francisco
earthquake.

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:34.187
There were only two left,
and she was 111.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.898
She was at the quake.
I'm gonna shoot for that.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:42.532
Schlesinger: Carl Reiner,

George Burns had
planned to do a show

01:22:24.357 --> 01:22:26.147
to celebrate
his hundredth birthday.

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:28.482

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.737
Almost. He was just
a few months shy.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:34.280

fulfill that dream of his

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:36.985

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:41.036
which would be April 29, 2054.

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:42.792
And he was gonna appear

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.293
at Caesars in Las Vegas,

01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:45.625
