00:37.087 --> 00:40.113

is sacked for another loss.

00:40.156 --> 00:42.681
Common name.
No relation.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.060
Come on,
we're still in this game.

00:46.096 --> 00:49.190
Just two touchdowns, a couple
of two-point conversions,

00:49.232 --> 00:52.201
an onside kick, and we're
just a field goal behind.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.169
Come on,
let's make some noise!

00:54.204 --> 00:55.171
Boo!

00:55.205 --> 00:56.263
Go, Arlen!

00:56.306 --> 00:57.330
Go, Arlen!

00:57.373 --> 00:58.499
Go, Arlen.

00:58.541 --> 01:00.304
Oh, here come the cheerleaders.

01:00.343 --> 01:03.506
You think maybe they will do
a real cheer just this once?

01:03.546 --> 01:06.242

Look at Bobby.

<i>Whatever happened
to cheerleaders</i>

01:36.212 --> 01:38.407
actually cheering?

01:38.448 --> 01:39.676
Alice Bullard.

01:39.716 --> 01:41.547
She was the best cheer coach

01:41.584 --> 01:42.812
I have ever seen.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.945
And she was 98 years old.

01:44.988 --> 01:47.718
I wonder whatever happened to
that woman. You know, I remember

01:47.757 --> 01:50.726
my junior year
in a game against Belton.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.354
I just didn't have it,
but then our cheerleaders

01:53.396 --> 01:55.523
started their
"Be Aggressive" cheer,

01:55.565 --> 01:57.590
and I was, and we won.

01:57.634 --> 02:01.035
Hank, I'm going
to do us all a favor.

02:01.070 --> 02:04.801
I am gonna help that new cheerleading
coach get her act together.

02:06.176 --> 02:08.336
I really did stay sweet.

02:13.283 --> 02:15.251
Peggy Hill at your service.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.651
Great. Grab a handle...
this thing weighs a ton.

02:17.687 --> 02:20.781
Wow, I feel like I'm already
making an impact.

02:20.824 --> 02:24.351
Now, how else can I help you
get the cheerleaders on track?

02:24.394 --> 02:28.660
On track? Does this look like the vest
of a coach who's not on track?

02:28.698 --> 02:30.563
FYI, we've had two wins

02:30.600 --> 02:32.261
at the Slim-Fast
Invitational,

02:32.302 --> 02:33.963
and one at Tampax.

02:34.003 --> 02:35.971
Yes, yes, very impressive.

02:36.005 --> 02:38.235
But I have noticed
that the cheerleaders

02:38.274 --> 02:41.675
are not really spending any time
backing the football team.

02:41.711 --> 02:43.611
The cheer squad
doesn't get trophies

02:43.646 --> 02:45.546
for how good
the football team does.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.641
We get 'em for
Motion and Dance,

02:47.684 --> 02:49.481
Basket Tosses, Jumps,

02:49.519 --> 02:51.146
and Attitude!

02:51.187 --> 02:55.089
You know, cheerleading
has changed since your day.

02:55.124 --> 02:56.250
Wait...

02:56.292 --> 02:59.022
you never had a day, did you?

02:59.062 --> 03:01.394
You weren't a cheerleader.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.832
No, but only because
people who thought they knew me,

03:04.868 --> 03:07.393
but clearly did not,
would not let me.

03:09.038 --> 03:10.300
Welcome aboard!

03:10.340 --> 03:13.468
Oh, and that mat has to go
all the way over there.

03:17.313 --> 03:20.407
So Peggy's gonna help coach
the cheerleaders at Landry.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.748
She says they're
gonna do <i>real</i> cheers.

03:22.785 --> 03:26.949
Good, but what we need to do
is get rid of Principal Moss.

03:26.990 --> 03:29.049
Maybe I should put
bourbon in his thermos

03:29.092 --> 03:30.855
and try to knock
him off the wagon.

03:30.894 --> 03:34.660
Don't worry, he can't hide behind
improved test scores forever.

03:34.697 --> 03:36.324
Hank! Dinner!

03:36.366 --> 03:37.628
Excuse me, fellas.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.228
I've got to go have dinner
with a cheerleader.

03:41.271 --> 03:44.069
Why does everything
good happen to Hank?

03:46.009 --> 03:47.306
Cheerleaders.

03:47.343 --> 03:49.675
Why does everybody think
they're so special?

03:49.712 --> 03:54.149
I could be covering the debate
tournament finals right now.

03:54.183 --> 03:57.482
Your mom's a cheerleader?

03:57.520 --> 03:58.817
Wow!

03:58.855 --> 04:01.585
I thought that was just
more of her big talk.

04:01.624 --> 04:04.718
Maybe she really did see
Dan Rather at the mall.

04:04.761 --> 04:07.389
Okay, girls,
who's ready to make some noise?

04:09.232 --> 04:12.326
Right. Our first lesson will be
how to make some noise.

04:12.368 --> 04:14.393
I don't have time for this.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.233
I need a new
top-of-the-pyramid.

04:16.272 --> 04:19.833
We've just lost
our lightest girl to homeschooling.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.902
Problem understood and solved.

04:22.946 --> 04:25.073
But how?

04:25.114 --> 04:26.342
Connie,

04:26.382 --> 04:28.714
how would you like to be
the top of the pyramid?

04:28.751 --> 04:30.241
- Huh?
- And...

04:32.555 --> 04:33.681
Nice hang time.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.247
You want to be a cheerleader?

04:35.291 --> 04:37.987
Me?! Are you kidding?!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.935
Hey, smart girl from
my algebra class,

04:46.970 --> 04:48.767
why are you dressed
like a cheerleader?

04:48.805 --> 04:52.036
Because I, um...
am a cheerleader.

04:52.075 --> 04:54.600
Cool. Well, you want to
come to a sleep-over?

04:54.644 --> 04:57.477
We're gonna sit around
and make fun of everybody.

04:58.581 --> 05:00.071
Cheer One this is Cheer Two.

05:00.116 --> 05:02.050
If you can hear me,
give me a "Y."

05:02.085 --> 05:05.521
Oh, you could not look any cuter
if you were dangling a kitten.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.991
It's amazing... I put on this outfit,
and it's, like...

05:09.025 --> 05:11.118
What's the opposite
of invisible?

05:11.160 --> 05:12.650
I've never had to know.

05:12.695 --> 05:14.128
Thank you, Mrs. Hill.

05:14.163 --> 05:16.563
Okay, girls, who's ready

05:16.599 --> 05:18.794
to turn this mother out?!

05:18.835 --> 05:20.097
M.C. Hammer is!

05:20.136 --> 05:21.433
Get in formation.

05:23.940 --> 05:24.998
Or...

05:25.041 --> 05:27.009
we could get the crowd
into the game.

05:27.043 --> 05:28.305
How about a cheer?

05:28.344 --> 05:30.608
Go... Longhorns!

05:30.646 --> 05:32.546
Peggy, the last thing we need

05:32.582 --> 05:35.779
is for our cheerleaders to
be distracted by the game.

05:35.818 --> 05:36.785
What I do need

05:36.819 --> 05:38.684
is for you to find my purse.

05:38.721 --> 05:39.949
Find your purse?
Yes.

05:39.989 --> 05:42.150
Oh, and go tell
Karen Smelko I said hi.

05:42.191 --> 05:45.183
She's on the fourth row up,
not counting the first row.

05:45.228 --> 05:47.492
: I will get the purse,
but I am undecided

05:47.530 --> 05:48.827
on the greeting.

05:48.865 --> 05:50.958
Sorry I'm late... took
longer than I thought

05:51.000 --> 05:52.365
to wash the eggs off my car.

05:52.402 --> 05:54.870
Sorry I'm late...
it took longer than I thought

05:54.904 --> 05:57.202
to egg Moss's car.

05:59.075 --> 06:01.475
Hey, Peggy, shouldn't
you be down there

06:01.511 --> 06:03.536
spelling things
with your arms?

06:03.579 --> 06:05.979
No, Hank,
I have a different job.

06:06.015 --> 06:07.505
Karen Smelko?

06:07.550 --> 06:09.643
Arlen has the ball,
fourth and goal...

06:09.685 --> 06:10.947
and they're going for it!

06:10.987 --> 06:13.615
They haven't converted
a fourth down all season.

06:13.656 --> 06:15.419
They're gonna need
the crowd behind them.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.153
Okay, let's take a break.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.161
We've got
our '80s Mega-Mix coming up.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.787
Where are they going?

06:20.830 --> 06:22.957
They're braiding
each other's hair?!

06:22.999 --> 06:24.364
That does it!

06:28.771 --> 06:30.102
Arlen, Arlen,

06:30.139 --> 06:31.868
fight, fight, fight!

06:31.908 --> 06:34.672
Push that ball
with all your might!

06:38.681 --> 06:39.943
Come on!

06:39.982 --> 06:42.314
Let's help our boys
before it's too late!

06:42.351 --> 06:45.582
Arlen, Arlen,
fight, fight, fight!

06:45.621 --> 06:49.250
Push that ball
with all your might!

06:49.292 --> 06:51.852
Arlen, Arlen,
fight, fight, fight!

06:51.894 --> 06:55.022
Push that ball
with all your might!

06:55.064 --> 06:59.160
You heard them... let's push that ball
with all your might!

07:05.942 --> 07:07.773
Ho, yeah!

07:12.448 --> 07:14.211
Hey, Hank,
your wife just reminded me

07:14.250 --> 07:16.514
of why I love football...
winning!

07:16.552 --> 07:18.179
See, Moss?

07:18.221 --> 07:20.246
We need more of that
and less of this.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.659
...and because
of you and your chanting,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.095
Francine just nailed a standing
back flip that no one saw!

07:28.131 --> 07:29.428
That was something, Peggy.

07:29.465 --> 07:31.399
Look, how would you like
to replace Jo Rita

07:31.434 --> 07:32.662
as the cheerleading coach?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.932
Me? Well, I...

07:34.971 --> 07:37.064
Excuse me one moment.

07:37.106 --> 07:39.199
Peggy, you know we're supposed

07:39.242 --> 07:41.972
to keep this channel open
for uniform emergencies.

07:42.011 --> 07:45.503
Sorry, I just wanted you to give
Karen Smelko a message from me.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.075
Principal Moss just made me
the new cheerleading coach!

07:49.118 --> 07:51.450
What?! I...

08:04.000 --> 08:05.661
Attention, ladies.

08:08.871 --> 08:09.997
Where's Jo Rita?

08:10.039 --> 08:12.439
It is not important
where she is.

08:12.475 --> 08:15.000
What is important
is why she is not here.

08:15.044 --> 08:16.534
Why is she not here?

08:16.579 --> 08:20.140
Because she did not understand
the role of a cheerleader:

08:20.183 --> 08:21.810
To get the fans fired up,

08:21.851 --> 08:23.978
to bring the crowd
into the game,

08:24.020 --> 08:26.284
to give our team
the extra edge

08:26.322 --> 08:30.315
that can turn a narrow defeat
into a certain victory.

08:30.359 --> 08:33.260
Do we still get
to wear our uniforms

08:33.296 --> 08:35.058
to school on Fridays?

08:35.097 --> 08:35.995
Yes.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.158
Okay.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.635
Arlen, Arlen,
fight, fight, fight!

08:40.669 --> 08:44.037
Push that ball
with all your might.

08:44.073 --> 08:45.665
Whoo!
Yeah!

08:46.709 --> 08:50.406
What ball
is she talking about?

08:50.446 --> 08:53.313
Do the two-point conversion
cheer!

08:53.349 --> 08:56.614
Hey, there, coach,
whatcha gonna do?

08:56.652 --> 08:59.177
Are you going to kick
or go for two?

09:03.192 --> 09:05.660
Perhaps I didn't set that up
properly.

09:05.695 --> 09:08.391
We would do that cheer
after we've scored,

09:08.431 --> 09:10.661
but only when it would be
advantageous

09:10.700 --> 09:12.167
for us to get two points.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.135
Once again from the top.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.967
Hey, there, coach...

09:16.005 --> 09:18.303
Well, this is all
going to hell.

09:18.341 --> 09:19.433
Oh, man.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.500
I can't have bored kids
at an assembly.

09:21.544 --> 09:22.670
It's asking for trouble.

09:22.712 --> 09:23.906
I'm going to cue the band.

09:25.615 --> 09:27.606
Oh, no! No! Not the band!

09:29.285 --> 09:31.480
Okay, I can't save
the cougar for the finale.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.785
Misty, put this on and chase
your tail like an idiot.

09:38.628 --> 09:40.186
It won't fit!

09:40.229 --> 09:41.560
Yes, it will.
It'll fit.

09:41.597 --> 09:43.087
Come on.
It's for the team!

09:43.132 --> 09:45.623
Yeah, kill that cougar!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.260
Yeah!
Yeah! Choke it!

09:51.407 --> 09:53.272
Quick, everybody,
beat the crap out of Misty!

09:53.309 --> 09:54.276
What?

09:56.512 --> 09:58.309
Stupid!

09:58.347 --> 09:59.871
Kick its butt, Connie!

10:10.326 --> 10:13.261
Ladies, I have learned
something today.

10:13.296 --> 10:15.389
People like violence.

10:15.431 --> 10:19.561
From now on we will demoralize
their teams

10:19.602 --> 10:22.070
by systematically
mock-secuting their mascots.

10:22.104 --> 10:23.366
Everyone, take a knife!

10:29.011 --> 10:31.605
Is it stab-and-stab?

10:31.647 --> 10:33.672
No, it's stab and a-stab.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.241
Okay, let's have a run-through.

10:36.285 --> 10:37.718
Misty, get in
the cougar costume.

10:37.753 --> 10:39.744
The costume smells like a butt.

10:39.789 --> 10:42.656
And it's really more of a job
for an ugly girl.

10:42.692 --> 10:43.659
I'll do it!

10:45.561 --> 10:47.995
Hey, there, hi, there,
we won't gloat.

10:48.030 --> 10:51.693
We'll stab the cougar
in the throat

10:51.734 --> 10:54.794
And when at last
the cougar's dead,

10:54.837 --> 10:57.829
we'll make him see
red red red red!

10:59.542 --> 11:01.271
I am slain!

11:02.578 --> 11:06.480
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

11:06.515 --> 11:10.781
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

11:12.254 --> 11:14.381
I'm so...

11:14.423 --> 11:16.050
cold.

11:21.797 --> 11:24.027
No hats in
the lunchroom, Dooley.

11:24.066 --> 11:25.124
Take it off.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.759
I'll die in these horns.

11:30.673 --> 11:31.640
Hey, Peggy!

11:31.674 --> 11:33.471
Why don't you sit with us today?

11:33.509 --> 11:36.069
Sweet Jesus. The cool table.

11:40.516 --> 11:42.450
Oh, I'm sorry, Jo Rita.

11:42.485 --> 11:43.679
Pull up the stepladder.

11:46.989 --> 11:49.514
You know, Jo Rita,
I could use some help.

11:49.558 --> 11:51.458
You want me
to find your purse?

11:51.494 --> 11:53.394
I want you to be my assistant.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.224
I'd love to.

11:56.265 --> 11:58.995
So, Peggy, give us the scoop.

11:59.034 --> 12:00.467
What have you got planned
for the Yellow Jackets

12:00.503 --> 12:01.731
this weekend?

12:01.771 --> 12:03.534
Well, we have
this yellow jacket costume

12:03.572 --> 12:05.472
and we're going
to put someone in it

12:05.508 --> 12:06.873
and we're going to stab it!

12:08.511 --> 12:11.241
That's it?
Another stabbing?

12:12.782 --> 12:16.013
Hey, maybe doing
the same thing over and over again

12:16.051 --> 12:17.245
will be our thing.

12:17.286 --> 12:18.310
It won't be boring.

12:18.354 --> 12:20.185
No! It'll be comforting!

12:24.427 --> 12:26.122
Ladies, we have a problem.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.063
Knife play
is just not enough anymore.

12:29.098 --> 12:31.157
Ideas! Yellow Jacket! Go!

12:31.200 --> 12:33.225
We could rip open its thorax

12:33.269 --> 12:35.703
and stuff it
with its own abdomen?

12:35.738 --> 12:37.706
Bobby, how is your death rattle?

12:39.809 --> 12:42.073
Great! Now, who do
we play after that?

12:42.111 --> 12:43.373
The Boswell Bears.

12:43.412 --> 12:46.939
Okay, okay. Now, how do you make
a bear suffer?

12:46.982 --> 12:48.950
Tie it up and torture its young.

12:48.984 --> 12:52.181
There's no mascot
we can't torture.

13:20.683 --> 13:22.480
Okay, Jo Rita, who's next?

13:22.518 --> 13:23.542
The Tornados.

13:23.586 --> 13:25.884
How are you going
to kill a tornado?

13:25.921 --> 13:26.910
Shoot it.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.423
Good news.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.049
Because of all
the school spirit,

13:30.092 --> 13:31.184
game attendance is up.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.694
I know!

13:32.728 --> 13:34.628
The ushers cannot keep up
with the after-game garbage.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.426
Yeah, but none of this will mean
anything

13:36.465 --> 13:38.330
unless we beat McMaynerbury
at Homecoming.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.733
Peggy, I'm giving you
the halftime show.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.637
It will be my finest hour.

13:45.674 --> 13:48.040
Now, who is McMaynerbury?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.442
The Fighting Irish.

13:49.478 --> 13:52.538
Fighting, fighting...

13:52.581 --> 13:54.412
fi... fly... flying...

13:54.450 --> 13:56.509
fly on the wall...

13:56.552 --> 13:58.850
Maybe the other part...
the Irish,

13:58.888 --> 14:01.356
That's got to be
fertile territory.

14:01.390 --> 14:05.349
Irish, Irish, flyrish.

14:05.394 --> 14:06.520
No, don't force it.

14:06.562 --> 14:07.790
Let it come to you, Peggy.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.025
People have made fun
of the Irish in the past.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.058
Maybe you can build
on their work.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.627
You know, my husband keeps

14:15.671 --> 14:18.196
several ethnic joke
books in the bathroom.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.935
I'll find something good.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.170
Longhorns! Longhorns!

14:23.212 --> 14:25.703
And that's the end
of the first half,

14:25.748 --> 14:27.477
with the Longhorns leading 31-2!

14:27.516 --> 14:29.245
Well, the playoffs are a lock.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.912
Peggy says the halftime show

14:30.953 --> 14:32.978
is going to be
high school caliber.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.512
Okay, girls, this is it.

14:34.557 --> 14:36.047
Misty, grab the rainbow.

14:36.091 --> 14:38.082
Everyone else get out
your shillelaghs.

14:39.762 --> 14:40.660
Beating sticks.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.392
Where's Jo Rita?

14:45.434 --> 14:46.958
The buckets of blood
are in her car.

14:47.002 --> 14:49.197
All right!
Go! Go!

14:49.238 --> 14:52.401
I'm so glad you could make it,
Mr. Flannery,

14:52.441 --> 14:55.842
Mr. Finnerty,
Mrs. O'Brien-Diaz.

14:55.878 --> 14:58.745
And now if you'll direct your
attention to the 50-yard line

14:58.781 --> 15:01.875
for a special presentation
by the Longhorn cheerleaders!

15:01.917 --> 15:03.544
Here, use my binoculars.

15:03.586 --> 15:05.679
I brought enough
for everybody.

15:11.627 --> 15:14.357
Top of the morning to ya, Arlen!

15:14.396 --> 15:16.387
I'm Irish!

15:16.432 --> 15:17.899
I hope I don't die

15:17.933 --> 15:20.731
from a wee bit
of the consumption!

15:24.840 --> 15:28.241
Sorry, Fighting Irishman,
but your jig is up!

15:28.277 --> 15:31.906
Beat him! Get him!

15:31.947 --> 15:34.575
Beat him! Beat him!
Beat him! Beat him!

15:47.262 --> 15:49.162
Are they ever coming out
of there?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.358
I bet they're trying

15:50.399 --> 15:52.424
to keep the quarterback
from crying.

15:52.468 --> 15:54.060
My legs have fallen asleep.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.661
Oh! Ah!

15:55.704 --> 15:57.399
Okay. We are in their heads.

15:57.439 --> 15:58.906
Right now,

15:58.941 --> 16:01.910
they are in there wishing
they joined the tennis team.

16:01.944 --> 16:04.344
Uh, Peggy, The Fighting Irish
ain't coming out.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.404
Oh, my God.

16:05.447 --> 16:07.506
We have cheered them
into submission!

16:08.784 --> 16:10.513
Actually, they're protesting
the game.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.110
What? Why?

16:12.154 --> 16:13.883
'Cause of what you did
to that leprechaun.

16:13.922 --> 16:15.981
Peggy, they're saying you
committed a hate crime.

16:16.025 --> 16:18.823
Aw, there goes me liver.

16:24.433 --> 16:26.128
<i>I can't believe</i>

16:26.168 --> 16:27.533
the school board
is thinking about

16:27.569 --> 16:28.661
taking our win away.

16:28.704 --> 16:30.695
As long as we stand firm,

16:30.739 --> 16:34.038
we've got nothing
to worry about.

16:35.511 --> 16:37.911
Now, I can take a joke as well
as the next person,

16:37.946 --> 16:39.573
but Peggy Hill has gone too far.

16:39.615 --> 16:41.412
What she did on that field

16:41.450 --> 16:43.611
is no different than what
the British have been doing

16:43.652 --> 16:44.778
to our brothers in Ulster

16:44.820 --> 16:47.653
for the last 800 years...

16:47.690 --> 16:50.022
the forced labor,
the seizure of property,

16:50.059 --> 16:53.392
the stifling and oppression
of our precious mother tongue.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.829
<i>Longadh beatha
Eire a Cliamhuinn a Eire!!</i>

16:55.864 --> 16:57.729
I have no idea
what he just said,

16:57.766 --> 17:00.860
but I do know that McMaynerbury
refused to play.

17:00.903 --> 17:02.427
They forfeited the game.

17:02.471 --> 17:03.631
And after the game,

17:03.672 --> 17:05.663
someone called me "Pat"
in the parking lot.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.766
It is my name,

17:06.809 --> 17:08.674
but they had
no way of knowing that.

17:10.479 --> 17:11.605
This ain't good, Moss.

17:11.646 --> 17:13.444
They're going to take
away our win.

17:13.482 --> 17:14.449
Do something.

17:14.483 --> 17:15.814
Now, hold on.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.115
It'd be a shame to take
this win away from our boys

17:18.153 --> 17:19.142
just' cause of Peggy.

17:19.188 --> 17:20.468
That would be blaming
the victim!

17:21.457 --> 17:22.981
What?! You were all behind me

17:23.025 --> 17:25.993
when it was the Cougars and
the Bears and the Mudhawks.

17:26.028 --> 17:28.087
It would have been disrespectful
of me

17:28.130 --> 17:29.757
not to bludgeon the Irishman.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.197
Peggy, shush.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.965
Whatever the board decides,

17:37.005 --> 17:39.303
I want you to know,
I am proud of you.

17:39.341 --> 17:41.036
And maybe I did get caught up

17:41.076 --> 17:43.408
in my own popularity
and lose my focus,

17:43.445 --> 17:45.242
because it's really not about

17:45.280 --> 17:47.646
torture or beatings,
or maiming per se.

17:47.683 --> 17:51.676
It's about backing your team
and inspiring them to victory.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.415
Good news, Peggy.
They let us keep our "W."

17:53.455 --> 17:55.150
We're going to the playoffs!

17:55.190 --> 17:56.521
Woo-hoo!
The big dance!

17:56.558 --> 17:58.992
Well, don't worry,
my team is ready.

17:59.027 --> 18:00.051
Sorry, Peggy.

18:00.095 --> 18:01.756
I'm going to have to ask you

18:01.797 --> 18:04.288
to stop using words
like "team" and "my."

18:04.333 --> 18:05.630
I'm putting Jo Rita
back in charge.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.827
What? Jo Rita?!

18:06.869 --> 18:09.030
Now, you can keep
teaching Spanish,

18:09.071 --> 18:10.538
but we're going to have
to keep an eye out in

18:10.572 --> 18:11.937
case you decide
to go after those people.

18:11.974 --> 18:13.202
This is crazy.

18:13.242 --> 18:16.177
The only thing I hate is
watching dance routines

18:16.211 --> 18:18.941
while our team
loses another game.

18:18.981 --> 18:22.178
Peggy, why don't you show these
girls how to lose gracefully.

18:22.217 --> 18:23.241
I will not.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.845
And if I go,
the cheerleaders will go

18:25.888 --> 18:28.254
in a V-formation
right behind me.

18:28.290 --> 18:29.621
Right, girls?

18:30.659 --> 18:32.456
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hill,

18:32.494 --> 18:36.157
but we like being
cheerleaders... a lot.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.563
We feel so bad.

18:37.599 --> 18:38.725
You, too, Connie?

18:38.767 --> 18:40.962
I can't go back.

18:41.003 --> 18:42.402
I'm sorry.

18:42.437 --> 18:44.462
We'll need you
to turn in your vest...

18:44.506 --> 18:46.940
you know, for future
coaches named Peggy.

18:55.818 --> 18:58.218
Uh, Peggy,

18:58.253 --> 19:00.721
me and the boy have worked up
a little something here.

19:02.958 --> 19:07.156
2-4-6-8, who should
the Longhorns appreciate?

19:07.196 --> 19:10.495
Mom! Mom! Mom!

19:12.267 --> 19:13.461
I got great seats.

19:13.502 --> 19:15.663
I told you, I'm not going
to the game.

19:16.939 --> 19:19.100
After all I did,
nobody stood up and said,

19:19.141 --> 19:22.269
"I know Peggy Hill
and she's no hate monger."

19:22.311 --> 19:24.472
They all just cut and ran.

19:24.513 --> 19:25.912
Even Connie.

19:25.948 --> 19:28.974
You know who didn't
turn their back on you, Peggy?

19:29.017 --> 19:30.177
The team.

19:30.219 --> 19:31.550
Dang it, this is the big game!

19:31.587 --> 19:33.987
What happens when the other side
yells,

19:34.022 --> 19:35.853
"We've got spirit, yes we do,

19:35.891 --> 19:37.916
we've got spirit,
how about you?"

19:37.960 --> 19:38.927
Well, Peggy,

19:38.961 --> 19:41.088
how 'bout you?

19:48.937 --> 19:50.427
Sorry, Mrs. Hill.

19:50.472 --> 19:53.134
Principal Moss gave me strict
orders not to let you in.

19:53.175 --> 19:55.040
What? That's ridiculous!

19:55.077 --> 19:56.237
Stay out of this, sir.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.609
Our beef's not with you.

20:00.249 --> 20:04.083
And the cheerleaders seem to be
doing another human pyramid.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.952
Oh! The Arlen quarterback
gets leveled!

20:10.092 --> 20:12.322
Come on, girls,
I'm only seeing freak.

20:12.361 --> 20:13.953
I want to see super-freak!

20:13.996 --> 20:14.963
♪ Get up on this ♪

20:14.997 --> 20:16.726
♪ Get up on this ♪

20:16.765 --> 20:17.823
♪ Push it ♪

20:17.866 --> 20:19.959
♪ Get up on this... ♪

20:21.670 --> 20:24.468
Connie, focus!

20:24.506 --> 20:25.473
♪ Push it ♪

20:25.507 --> 20:27.907
♪ Get up on this... ♪

20:27.943 --> 20:30.434
This is the playoffs,
for God's sakes.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.810
My bullhorn!

20:31.847 --> 20:33.178
What are you doing?

20:33.215 --> 20:35.740
Someone has to light a fire
under this crowd.

20:35.784 --> 20:37.843
Connie, get back in formation
this instant,

20:37.886 --> 20:39.751
or you can say good-bye
to the uniform

20:39.788 --> 20:42.450
and a guaranteed seven candid
photos in the yearbook.

20:46.962 --> 20:50.398
This season's been some kind
of roller coaster, folks.

20:50.432 --> 20:52.229
We've have losing streaks...

20:52.267 --> 20:53.427
Ready, okay.

20:53.468 --> 20:55.527
When I say go,
you say Longhorns.

20:55.570 --> 20:56.537
Go...

20:56.571 --> 20:57.538
Longhorns!

20:57.572 --> 20:59.039
Arlen, Arlen...

20:59.074 --> 21:00.837
Wait, Hank, do you hear that?

21:00.876 --> 21:02.605
Push that ball
with all your might!

21:02.644 --> 21:05.238
- Arlen, Arlen...
- I taught Connie that cheer.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.508
...fight, fight, fight!

21:06.548 --> 21:08.675
Push that ball
with your might.

21:08.717 --> 21:12.016
Seems like there's a rally
going on in the Landry stands...

21:12.054 --> 21:14.614
The fans are going nuts and
Gribble's running downfield...

21:14.656 --> 21:20.026
