WEBVTT

00:00.016 --> 00:01.375
Who's up for Chinese checkers?

00:01.438 --> 00:03.164
Oh, half the marbles are missing.

00:03.219 --> 00:05.171
Everyone, spread out
and find a suitable replacement

00:05.226 --> 00:06.434
for the red and white ones.

00:06.481 --> 00:08.265
And a suitable replacement
for a pet in this house.

00:08.314 --> 00:11.377
Something snobby and purebred,
with lots of health issues

00:11.417 --> 00:13.541
so it dies before I get bored with it.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.112
You hurt his feelings!

00:18.180 --> 00:19.580
Don't you have a heart?

00:19.682 --> 00:22.449
He does, and it's just covered
under layers of snark.

00:23.486 --> 00:25.753
Taylor, it's game night.
Do you want to join us?

00:25.821 --> 00:27.521
Don't be ridiculous.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.390
I'm going downtown with my friends.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.992
Have fun with your little games.

00:33.129 --> 00:35.529
I do not like what our nice,
fun-loving Taylor has become

00:35.598 --> 00:37.598
since she started hanging out
with these popular girls.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.400
This is the way she walks around school

00:39.502 --> 00:40.934
with her stuck-up friends...

00:42.638 --> 00:44.672
- Excellent pantomime work.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.944 --> 00:50.044
Spencer!

00:50.146 --> 00:51.812
I've got big news!

00:51.914 --> 00:53.947
Wait for it.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.415
Wait for it.

00:55.461 --> 00:57.169
Ta-da!

00:57.238 --> 00:59.672
Please tell me this has
nothing to do with Viagra.

00:59.741 --> 01:04.275
No, my house-arrest ankle
bracelet isn't beeping anymore.

01:04.345 --> 01:06.012
That's because I don't have one.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.380
I'm a free man!

01:07.448 --> 01:08.814
Congratulations!

01:08.883 --> 01:10.316
Tomorrow we golf. You got clubs?

01:10.385 --> 01:11.584
No.

01:11.653 --> 01:13.519
I'm buying you clubs.
Can I buy him clubs?

01:13.588 --> 01:15.321
- Um...
- I'm buying you clubs!

01:15.390 --> 01:18.124
You know, you got a good kid here.

01:18.192 --> 01:20.059
A true friend, which is hard to find.

01:20.209 --> 01:21.942
Because when you're rich,

01:22.044 --> 01:24.411
people are always trying
to get close to you.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.181
Biggie called it...
mo money, mo problems.

01:27.249 --> 01:28.549
Oliver, be ready.

01:28.617 --> 01:31.085
I got us a tee time...
9:00 a.m., Longshore.

01:31.153 --> 01:33.053
- You got golf shoes?
- No.

01:33.122 --> 01:34.421
I'm buying you golf shoes.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.923
I'm buying him golf shoes!

01:36.058 --> 01:37.558
Ha-ha!

01:37.626 --> 01:39.560
You hear what he said?

01:39.628 --> 01:41.161
I'm a good kid.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.530
Yeah, I'm not buyin' it.

01:50.573 --> 01:51.805
Hey, Taylor. You're home early.

01:51.907 --> 01:53.841
Something wrong?

01:53.943 --> 01:55.943
No! Why does something
always have to be wrong?

01:56.045 --> 01:57.945
And why are you guys always
in my business?

01:57.980 --> 01:59.313
I just want to be left alone!

01:59.415 --> 02:00.614
God!!

02:02.618 --> 02:03.884
Such a fun age.

02:03.986 --> 02:05.285
Come on, let's go talk to her.

02:05.387 --> 02:06.587
She said she wants to be left alone.

02:06.655 --> 02:08.388
I want to be left alone
all the time, Greg,

02:08.491 --> 02:09.823
but nobody listens to me.

02:15.231 --> 02:16.563
So, what's going on?

02:16.665 --> 02:18.532
Everything is fine.

02:18.634 --> 02:19.600
It's perfect.

02:19.702 --> 02:21.168
I love my life, okay?

02:21.270 --> 02:23.137
The only reason why I'm getting
misty right now

02:23.239 --> 02:24.455
is because I look at my life
and I think,

02:24.504 --> 02:26.908
"Wow, it's so beautiful!" Now get out!

02:27.276 --> 02:29.009
Something is obviously wrong.

02:29.111 --> 02:31.912
And we're not leaving until
we find out what it is.

02:31.948 --> 02:33.247
You won't understand!

02:33.349 --> 02:34.549
- Try us.
- Mm-hmm.

02:36.352 --> 02:38.686
We were at Tom Garrity's house
just hanging out,

02:38.755 --> 02:40.688
and I went to talk to Summit,
Zola, and Londyn,

02:40.790 --> 02:42.557
but they kept ignoring me
and walked away.

02:42.659 --> 02:44.959
So I followed them and I tried
talking to them again,

02:45.061 --> 02:46.461
but they just kept ditching me.

02:46.529 --> 02:47.929
And then when I asked them why,

02:48.031 --> 02:50.431
Summit said they're reevaluating
their friend group.

02:50.533 --> 02:51.799
What does that even mean?

02:51.901 --> 02:53.101
She's right, I don't understand.

02:53.203 --> 02:54.368
It means I'm out.

02:54.471 --> 02:55.770
I left my old friends
to be with my new friends,

02:55.872 --> 02:57.338
and now my new friends don't want me.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.406
I have no one.

02:58.475 --> 03:00.041
- You always have us.
- Oh, Greg.

03:00.143 --> 03:01.642
Is that what you think of me?

03:01.745 --> 03:04.512
That I'm just some loser whose
only friends are her parents?

03:04.614 --> 03:06.247
- No, I...
- Taylor, I understand.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.615
Don't even!

03:07.684 --> 03:09.984
Maybe in the 1900s something
like this happened to you.

03:10.053 --> 03:11.252
But it's different now.

03:11.354 --> 03:12.633
You don't know what I'm going through

03:12.719 --> 03:14.390
and don't say you do because you don't!

03:16.960 --> 03:18.159
She stormed out of her own room.

03:18.194 --> 03:19.560
I wonder when she's gonna realize...

03:19.662 --> 03:21.062
Get out!

03:22.332 --> 03:24.232
Reevaluate their friend group?

03:24.300 --> 03:27.268
Hans Gruber, how'd you get up there?

03:27.303 --> 03:29.937
Greg, there's something I really
need you to understand...

03:30.006 --> 03:32.082
from now on, that one's your pillow.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.090
I'll get him down.

03:33.145 --> 03:34.578
And then you'll change the sheets.

03:34.646 --> 03:35.979
- Yes.
- Like, really change them.

03:36.114 --> 03:38.081
Actually get the elastic
under the mattress

03:38.149 --> 03:39.148
so it doesn't slip out

03:39.217 --> 03:41.217
and I dream I'm caught in a fishing net.

03:41.286 --> 03:42.652
I got it.

03:42.754 --> 03:44.120
Hans Gruber, get down.

03:44.189 --> 03:45.722
Get down. Come on.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.424
Come on. Good boy. Good boy.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.026
Gruber.

03:50.095 --> 03:52.095
Gruber, get down.

03:52.163 --> 03:53.529
Come on, come on.

03:53.631 --> 03:54.764
Come on.

03:54.866 --> 03:56.399
- Mnh-mnh.
- Come on.

03:56.468 --> 03:58.076
Come down.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.607
Yeah, Greg, that's why
the 400-pound farm animal

04:00.676 --> 04:02.843
won't get off our comforter...
Enunciation.

04:04.246 --> 04:05.412
That pig has got to go.

04:05.514 --> 04:08.115
I know! But what do I do?
I can't sell him for meat.

04:08.183 --> 04:09.616
Anna-Kat considers him family.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.385
I give to this charity that lets animals

04:11.453 --> 04:13.487
safely live out the rest
of their lives on a farm.

04:13.555 --> 04:14.755
You could bring him there.

04:14.857 --> 04:16.790
Is that one of your
"date a woman, dump her,

04:16.892 --> 04:17.958
but then support her charities

04:18.027 --> 04:19.426
so you don't seem like a monster" deals?

04:19.528 --> 04:21.060
Yes. But if they don't have a charity,

04:21.163 --> 04:22.529
then they get a Jo Malone candle.

04:22.631 --> 04:23.964
The big one with the three wicks.

04:24.066 --> 04:25.966
The farm sounds perfect.

04:26.035 --> 04:28.035
Now I just have to convince
Anna-Kat and Greg.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.870
Just sneak it out
in the middle of the night.

04:29.972 --> 04:31.972
That's what I did with
Richard's mom when I moved her

04:32.074 --> 04:33.907
out of the guest room
into a retirement home.

04:34.009 --> 04:35.509
She bit me, but it was worth it.

04:40.115 --> 04:43.550
That's them. The Blontourage.

04:43.619 --> 04:45.986
- The girls who kicked Taylor to the curb?
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.055 --> 04:49.222
If you squint, you can almost
see them doing porn in 10 years.

04:49.325 --> 04:50.857
I'm just gonna go say hi.

04:50.893 --> 04:52.759
Uh, you're just gonna go
make things worse.

04:52.861 --> 04:54.528
- Or better!
- But probably worse!

04:54.630 --> 04:55.829
Maybe better!

04:57.666 --> 04:59.733
- Girls.
- Hi, Mrs. Otto.

04:59.768 --> 05:01.635
No. We're not doing that.
This isn't a pleasant meeting.

05:01.704 --> 05:03.870
- I'll have...
- She'll have nothing!

05:03.973 --> 05:05.205
What's your deal?

05:05.274 --> 05:09.109
My deal is that you blew off
Taylor for no reason.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.245
Well, let me tell you something.

05:12.348 --> 05:14.982
I know you think you're all that and...

05:15.084 --> 05:16.283
Wait, wait. All what?

05:16.318 --> 05:19.219
- All that.
- What's that mean?

05:19.321 --> 05:20.420
It's a saying.

05:20.522 --> 05:22.122
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.057
It's short for
"all that and a bag of chips."

05:24.159 --> 05:25.759
Chips are terrible for you.

05:25.861 --> 05:28.929
Yeah, even the healthy kind are
like a bazillion calories.

05:29.031 --> 05:30.297
Totally. Like, one bag...

05:30.366 --> 05:33.533
Guys. We are not talking
about bags of chips.

05:33.635 --> 05:36.937
We are talking about what bags
of garbage you are.

05:37.973 --> 05:39.740
Incredible transition.

05:39.775 --> 05:43.210
Personally, for me, I'm glad you
blew off my daughter

05:43.312 --> 05:45.779
because I don't want her ending
up like you.

05:45.881 --> 05:49.116
Pretty on the outside
but rotten on the inside.

05:49.184 --> 05:52.452
And eventually, that rottenness
will come to the surface

05:52.554 --> 05:54.488
and no amount of concealer will hide

05:54.590 --> 05:56.857
what dried-out old hags you become.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.226
And when you look
at your shriveled reflections

05:59.294 --> 06:01.161
in the mirror, remember, I called it.

06:04.266 --> 06:05.532
How'd that go?

06:05.634 --> 06:07.100
I made it better.

06:07.202 --> 06:08.201
Or worse.

06:08.270 --> 06:10.537
- I made it worse.
- Yeah.

06:12.994 --> 06:14.619
Hans Gruber won't come down.

06:14.681 --> 06:16.439
Is he sick or depressed or something?

06:16.494 --> 06:17.843
Well...

06:17.921 --> 06:19.728
near as I can tell, he's suffering from

06:19.797 --> 06:22.030
"I should be living on a farm,
but these stupid people

06:22.099 --> 06:24.538
brought me into their house and
named me after a movie villain."

06:26.244 --> 06:28.377
That sounds like
a fairly judgy condition.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.112
I think what Dr. Hatch
is trying to say is,

06:30.198 --> 06:33.208
Hans Gruber belongs on a farm
with other pigs.

06:34.712 --> 06:36.245
He's right. It's time.

06:36.347 --> 06:39.114
Now, how do we get him off the bed?

06:39.149 --> 06:42.017
Stop feeding him. When he's
hungry, he'll find his way down.

06:42.119 --> 06:45.087
You're giving away Hans Gruber?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.289
I'm sorry, honey.
He belongs with his own kind.

06:47.391 --> 06:48.824
I'm his own kind!

06:48.926 --> 06:50.759
Anna-Kat.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.561
Okay, I'm off to see some morons

06:52.663 --> 06:54.730
that have a llama in their apartment.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.500
Anna-Kat, Hans Gruber
has to go to a farm.

06:58.602 --> 06:59.768
He's gotten too big.

06:59.803 --> 07:02.671
You didn't send Mom to a farm
after she had Taylor!

07:04.174 --> 07:05.541
What'd she say?

07:05.609 --> 07:08.310
She said she needs some time
to process things.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.046
Did you hear from Oliver?

07:11.115 --> 07:12.314
He texted me.

07:12.383 --> 07:14.950
They landed safely in New York
and are grabbing a bite.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.985
I can't believe our son took
a helicopter to dinner

07:17.054 --> 07:18.687
with his 80-year-old billionaire friend.

07:18.756 --> 07:20.956
There is so much bad in that sentence,

07:21.025 --> 07:22.591
I am choosing to block it out.

07:26.964 --> 07:28.397
The vet was right.

07:28.465 --> 07:31.500
Don't feed them, and eventually
they'll come down.

07:33.904 --> 07:35.137
What's up?

07:35.239 --> 07:36.505
Nothin'.

07:36.607 --> 07:37.639
You?

07:37.741 --> 07:39.207
Nothin'.

07:39.276 --> 07:40.375
Cool.

07:40.477 --> 07:42.344
Subzero over here.

07:49.253 --> 07:51.887
Do you think maybe we could play a game?

07:51.989 --> 07:53.388
<i>Stay calm, Katie.</i>

07:53.490 --> 07:55.657
<i>Don't look too eager and scare her off.</i>

07:55.793 --> 07:58.627
<i>Give Greg the "play it cool" look.</i>

07:58.696 --> 08:01.863
<i>He never understands my looks.</i>

08:01.932 --> 08:04.766
I'm up for playing a game.

08:04.868 --> 08:06.301
Just not the mystery one.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.669
Mystery one?

08:07.705 --> 08:10.606
It's the one with the rope and
the candlestick and the clues.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.307
Yeah, with the clues. What is that?

08:12.409 --> 08:14.509
- Uhh.
- It's on the tip of my tongue.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.778
- With the rooms.
- Yeah, with the clues.

08:16.847 --> 08:18.680
It's Clue, guys. The game is Clue.

08:22.853 --> 08:25.454
Look who's off the bed and is hungry.

08:25.522 --> 08:27.889
Oh, Anna-Kat, let me help you with that.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.426
Now that Taylor's been cast out,

08:31.495 --> 08:32.861
our sweet, fun-loving girl is back.

08:32.962 --> 08:35.330
I know. Hopefully she'll be
alone and friendless forever.

08:40.504 --> 08:41.803
Hey, Mrs. Otto.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.439
Uhhh... What are you doing here?

08:44.541 --> 08:46.341
Well, I-I thought about what you said

08:46.443 --> 08:48.110
about being rotten on the inside,

08:48.178 --> 08:50.312
and I want to make up with Taylor.

08:50.414 --> 08:51.680
That's very nice of you,

08:51.782 --> 08:54.182
but she already has
a new group of friends.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.417
Who?

08:55.486 --> 09:00.322
Uh, Brenda, Brandon, Dylan,
and Jennie Garth.

09:00.391 --> 09:02.591
You don't know them.
They don't go to your school.

09:02.693 --> 09:05.861
Now she's too cool to talk to you. Ha!

09:09.533 --> 09:10.899
Who was at the door?

09:13.103 --> 09:15.203
- Pizza guy.
- So where's the pizza?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.772
I ate it.

09:16.874 --> 09:18.573
Okay.

09:18.609 --> 09:20.308
<i>It's sweet she's so trusting.</i>

09:20.344 --> 09:21.677
<i>But it hurts my feelings</i>

09:21.779 --> 09:23.979
<i>that she thought I ate
a whole pizza in 30 seconds.</i>

09:24.081 --> 09:26.915
Mom! Dad! Come quick!
You have to see this!

09:28.713 --> 09:30.713
_

09:31.488 --> 09:33.822
It's exactly like in "Charlotte's Web."

09:33.924 --> 09:35.590
Hans Gruber can spell.

09:35.726 --> 09:37.893
We can't give away a pig this special.

09:37.961 --> 09:40.128
Actually, in "Charlotte's Web,"

09:40.230 --> 09:42.664
it was the spider
who could spell, not the pig.

09:42.766 --> 09:43.832
So...

09:43.901 --> 09:45.867
I had to pick the one book you've read.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.903
Sweetie, Hans Gruber belongs on a farm.

09:47.971 --> 09:49.738
But I don't want him to go.

09:49.807 --> 09:51.039
I know.

09:51.141 --> 09:53.842
But if you love somebody,
you need to let them grow.

09:53.944 --> 09:56.611
And sometimes that means
letting them go.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.214
And then you'll put my hair in a bow.

09:59.316 --> 10:01.149
Stop trying to Dr. Seuss me.

10:03.721 --> 10:04.953
Who was at the door earlier?

10:05.055 --> 10:07.122
I know you didn't eat a pizza
in 30 seconds.

10:07.224 --> 10:08.264
Thank you.

10:08.312 --> 10:10.178
It was that Zola girl
trying to make up with Taylor.

10:10.247 --> 10:11.155
What'd you tell her?

10:11.210 --> 10:12.452
I told her that Taylor was friends

10:12.491 --> 10:14.816
with the cast of "90210"
and to never talk to her again.

10:14.885 --> 10:16.785
- Good.
- Good?

10:16.854 --> 10:19.187
No lecture on morals?

10:19.289 --> 10:21.490
No "Oh, what a tangled web we weave...

10:21.592 --> 10:25.093
when we first... lie to our friend...

10:25.195 --> 10:26.561
Steve?"

10:28.198 --> 10:30.032
Would you like to hear
the correct version,

10:30.134 --> 10:32.067
or shall I act like
you nailed it and move on?

10:32.169 --> 10:33.201
Nailed it and move on.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.303
Okay.

10:35.406 --> 10:36.438
Well, hey, guys.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.873
We had the best day.

10:37.908 --> 10:39.541
We went golfing and then...

10:39.610 --> 10:42.811
Ran into some old acquaintances
who weren't happy to see me.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.846
They bet us $10,000 on a round of golf.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.014
We crushed them.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.116
<i>You</i> crushed them. He was amazing.

10:48.185 --> 10:50.018
At my prison,
there wasn't much do but golf.

10:50.087 --> 10:51.687
You know, unless you were
into sport fishing

10:51.789 --> 10:53.055
or hot air ballooning.

10:53.123 --> 10:54.823
We took our winnings
and blew it all on dinner.

10:54.892 --> 10:58.994
How did you spend $10,000 on dinner?

10:59.063 --> 11:01.797
Dessert, plus tip. Adds up.

11:01.865 --> 11:05.300
Well, it's been a long day.
I think I'll go home

11:05.402 --> 11:09.404
and have a Manhattan or two
and drunk-dial Daryl Hannah.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.572
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

11:10.674 --> 11:12.040
That guy is my hero.

11:12.109 --> 11:13.742
Isn't your father
supposed to be your hero?

11:15.245 --> 11:16.812
Good night, Dad.

11:19.049 --> 11:20.849
I got up early and made you breakfast.

11:20.951 --> 11:21.950
Aww.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.319
- Mmm.
- Good.

11:24.388 --> 11:25.320
It's good.

11:25.422 --> 11:26.822
It has kale in it.

11:26.890 --> 11:28.223
Don't ruin it for me.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.759
I thought later we can go
for a walk down at the beach.

11:30.828 --> 11:33.061
We can bury Dad in the sand
and then give him boobies.

11:33.130 --> 11:35.263
I'm gonna go see if there's a bucket.

11:36.366 --> 11:39.601
It's official...
friendless Taylor just surpassed

11:39.636 --> 11:41.603
"five-month-old-
sleeps-18-hours-a-day Taylor"

11:41.705 --> 11:43.438
as my favorite Taylor.

11:43.507 --> 11:45.741
Oh, it's her phone.

11:45.809 --> 11:48.076
It's one of the Blondetourage
texting her.

11:48.145 --> 11:49.311
Zola.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.114
She's the one who always has
that dumb look on her face.

11:52.182 --> 11:54.082
What'd she say?

11:54.184 --> 11:55.817
"Hey, Tay-Tay." Hate her.

11:55.919 --> 11:57.552
- Mm.
- "Where are you?

11:57.654 --> 11:59.554
I stopped by your house
last night to talk,

11:59.623 --> 12:01.223
but your parents said you were out.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.257
Let's hang."

12:02.359 --> 12:04.025
Hey, I also found a Frisbee!

12:04.094 --> 12:05.160
Oh, God.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.264
What are you doing?

12:09.366 --> 12:10.866
- Feeling up your mom.
- Mm-hmm.

12:10.968 --> 12:12.801
With my phone?

12:12.870 --> 12:15.704
That's what I'm into, Taylor.
Don't judge.

12:17.374 --> 12:20.342
Zola stopped by last night?
And you didn't tell me?

12:20.444 --> 12:22.711
We didn't want you running back
to those terrible girls.

12:22.813 --> 12:24.846
They have already showed you
who they really are.

12:24.948 --> 12:26.648
They're the worst and not to be trusted.

12:26.717 --> 12:28.049
Kinda like my parents.

12:28.085 --> 12:29.284
Hey. We're trying to protect you.

12:29.386 --> 12:31.319
When your mom yelled at them
at Stewart and Kingston's...

12:31.388 --> 12:32.821
- Oh, Greg.
- You yelled at them?

12:32.923 --> 12:35.157
They were asking for it.
Who doesn't eat potato chips?

12:35.225 --> 12:38.193
Are you insane?! You're ruining my life!

12:41.298 --> 12:42.697
She's right.

12:42.766 --> 12:44.866
We are no better than the Blondetourage.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.201
We're the Parentourage.

12:46.303 --> 12:47.235
Ottotourage.

12:47.337 --> 12:48.470
No need to one-up me, Greg.

12:48.572 --> 12:50.672
Hey, Spencer and I are going
down to the marina

12:50.774 --> 12:52.841
this afternoon to test out
yachts from Dubai.

12:52.943 --> 12:55.377
Is there a rule about wearing
golf shoes yacht-shopping?

12:56.380 --> 12:58.346
Why am I asking you guys?

12:58.482 --> 13:01.082
I'm just setting you up to fail.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.685
I was never crazy about
Spencer's influence on Oliver,

13:03.787 --> 13:06.421
but now that he's mobile,
it's going to get worse.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.191
I am going to go over there
and lay down the law.

13:15.532 --> 13:16.765
Hi, Spencer.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.500
I rang the bell and no one answered,

13:18.602 --> 13:20.168
so I came around the side.

13:20.270 --> 13:25.173
Oliver thinks the world of you.

13:25.275 --> 13:27.642
But he is an impressionable kid,

13:27.711 --> 13:32.280
and, well, we're not helicopter people.

13:32.349 --> 13:33.949
You know, Spencer?

13:39.690 --> 13:41.456
Spencer?

13:43.000 --> 13:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:50.500 --> 13:52.801
Oh, my God.

13:59.109 --> 14:01.243
Oh, Spencer.

14:19.105 --> 14:20.971
Oliver, we need to talk to you.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.474
Listen, I need to go
yacht shopping with Spencer

14:23.543 --> 14:25.075
to complete the cycle.

14:25.144 --> 14:26.410
You look confused.

14:26.479 --> 14:28.245
The cycle consists of the big four...

14:28.281 --> 14:30.448
mansion, Ferrari,

14:30.550 --> 14:31.949
plane, yacht.

14:32.051 --> 14:32.983
Oliver...

14:33.052 --> 14:34.785
I know, I know. I'm a douchebag.

14:34.854 --> 14:36.387
It's not that.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.956
Please. We need you to sit down.

14:39.025 --> 14:40.191
It's about Spencer.

14:40.259 --> 14:41.525
What about Spencer?

14:43.663 --> 14:47.832
Sweetie, I am so sorry to tell you this.

14:47.934 --> 14:49.266
Tell me what?

14:49.368 --> 14:51.202
Spencer...

14:54.607 --> 14:56.006
...passed away today.

14:56.075 --> 14:58.609
What are you talking about?
He was just here.

14:58.678 --> 15:00.644
He was perfectly fine yesterday.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.615
I know it didn't seem like he
was an old guy, but he was.

15:04.684 --> 15:08.719
The paramedics said his heart
just stopped.

15:08.788 --> 15:12.122
He died peacefully, lying by his pool.

15:12.191 --> 15:15.326
It's okay, honey. We're here for you.

15:15.428 --> 15:16.494
I'm fine.

15:16.562 --> 15:18.896
I know he was your friend.

15:18.998 --> 15:21.732
And it is okay to be upset.

15:21.801 --> 15:23.901
Good to know. But you're right.

15:23.970 --> 15:26.437
He wasn't young and stuff happens.

15:26.506 --> 15:29.540
But he died rich.
That's the dream, right?

15:29.642 --> 15:32.209
I got to go cancel the yacht guy.

15:35.348 --> 15:38.015
What was that? He didn't even cry.

15:38.117 --> 15:39.884
His voice didn't even crack.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.318
Maybe he's in shock?

15:41.420 --> 15:43.320
I'm sure it'll set in eventually.

15:43.422 --> 15:45.022
What if it doesn't?

15:45.124 --> 15:48.158
Then we make him watch Pixar
movies until he feels something.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.062
Honey, don't worry.

15:52.098 --> 15:54.498
On the farm, there's a lot of
room for him to run around.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.001
He'll have friends and be free.

15:57.069 --> 15:59.370
Yeah, free to be a bag of pork rinds.

16:00.873 --> 16:03.541
What happened to,
"it'll set in eventually"?

16:03.643 --> 16:05.709
Oliver just has issues with happiness.

16:05.811 --> 16:07.311
He has trouble with empathy,

16:07.380 --> 16:09.313
and he's currently showing
no signs of grief.

16:09.348 --> 16:12.716
You realize that is the textbook
definition of a psychopath.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.785
But he's not torturing animals.

16:14.887 --> 16:17.087
You're right. How are we so blessed?

16:25.264 --> 16:28.165
Look. He already made friends.

16:28.267 --> 16:30.067
Yeah. Pig friends.

16:30.169 --> 16:31.468
He looks pretty happy.

16:31.537 --> 16:33.370
- Mm-hmm.
- He does, doesn't he?

16:34.407 --> 16:36.507
Okay, we've been here long enough.

16:36.609 --> 16:39.009
Just say goodbye and we can
get on with our lives.

16:39.111 --> 16:41.712
Come on.

16:42.882 --> 16:45.783
Hans Gruber,
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

16:45.885 --> 16:48.185
♪ Me and you, and you and me ♪

16:48.254 --> 16:51.722
♪ No matter how they toss
the dice, it had to be ♪

16:51.791 --> 16:53.824
Yep. That was our jam.

16:54.994 --> 16:56.660
Bye, Hans.

16:56.729 --> 16:59.296
I know we didn't start out
the best of friends,

16:59.365 --> 17:00.764
but you grew on me.

17:00.866 --> 17:03.133
The night I ate
all those Girl Scout Cookies,

17:03.202 --> 17:05.970
I looked over and saw you
chewing on a used coffee filter.

17:06.038 --> 17:08.973
I feel like you did it to make
me feel better about myself.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.909
And it worked, so thank you.

17:16.915 --> 17:18.482
Goodbye, Hans Gruber.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.117
At least you can make friends here

17:20.219 --> 17:21.551
without your parents butting in

17:21.621 --> 17:23.252
and deciding who's best for you.

17:27.859 --> 17:30.094
So this is it.
When Daddy brought you home,

17:30.129 --> 17:32.529
you got a second chance at life,
and I got a chance

17:32.598 --> 17:35.111
to know what real
friendship is all about.

17:36.252 --> 17:38.902
I'm gonna miss your
snorts and your nose kisses.

17:38.938 --> 17:42.072
I'm gonna miss playing fetch
with Daddy's hairbrush.

17:42.141 --> 17:44.141
- What did she just say?
- Shh.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.243
Be a good pig.

17:46.312 --> 17:48.879
And I'll be back to visit
before you know it.

17:55.721 --> 17:58.355
You did good, baby.

17:58.424 --> 18:00.691
I'm spent. Let's go.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.526
Wait. Oliver.

18:02.628 --> 18:04.595
Aren't <i> you</i> going to say goodbye?

18:06.198 --> 18:08.432
Fine.

18:10.069 --> 18:11.935
Hey.

18:12.038 --> 18:14.304
Take it easy, pig.

18:14.407 --> 18:17.775
Oliver, you're never
going to see him again.

18:17.877 --> 18:20.778
Okay.

18:22.715 --> 18:24.782
I guess she's right.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.051
I'm not gonna see you again.

18:29.955 --> 18:31.855
But that's life.

18:36.762 --> 18:38.629
I just want you to know...

18:40.433 --> 18:42.700
...meeting you was one
of the best things

18:42.768 --> 18:44.134
that's ever happened to me.

18:44.236 --> 18:46.036
I'm sorry I never told you that.

18:46.105 --> 18:48.772
I'm just...

18:50.009 --> 18:52.443
The thing is,

18:52.545 --> 18:55.212
I feel like I just got to know you,

18:55.281 --> 18:56.914
and now you're gone.

18:58.984 --> 19:00.451
It's not fair!

19:02.588 --> 19:04.354
I know, baby.

19:04.457 --> 19:05.422
I know.

19:07.393 --> 19:10.994
Oh, my sweet boy.

19:25.644 --> 19:27.978
It was a good idea to play
Monopoly in honor of Spencer.

19:28.047 --> 19:30.214
Yeah, we would've caught him
sneaking money into his pocket,

19:30.316 --> 19:31.982
and when we called him on it
he would've gone...

19:32.084 --> 19:33.784
"Swiss bank account, ha-ha!"

19:35.988 --> 19:37.121
Room for one more?

19:37.189 --> 19:39.089
I thought you were going out
with the Blondetourage.

19:39.158 --> 19:41.425
They were supposed to pick me
up, but they blew me off.

19:41.527 --> 19:43.494
I saw on Snapchat they're
already at the party.

19:43.596 --> 19:45.395
Those girls are the worst.

19:45.498 --> 19:46.830
- Mm-hmm.
- I was so stupid.

19:46.932 --> 19:48.632
I should've never gone back with them.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.434
You were right.

19:50.536 --> 19:53.570
Sometimes that happens.

19:53.672 --> 19:55.372
Now come on and sit down.

19:55.474 --> 19:58.275
You can either be a button or a Skittle.

20:01.413 --> 20:02.813
You're the button.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.494
- Yes!
- Yeah!

20:07.659 --> 20:09.494
Gotta pay up.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.783
Goodnight, sweetheart.

20:13.885 --> 20:15.151
Mama?

20:15.253 --> 20:17.120
You're not gonna die soon, are you?

20:19.224 --> 20:24.211
I am not gonna die
for a very, very long time.

20:24.531 --> 20:26.197
But you will someday.

20:26.258 --> 20:29.036
Yes. But by the time that happens,

20:29.138 --> 20:31.105
you will be married, with kids,

20:31.207 --> 20:33.174
and I will be living above your garage

20:33.276 --> 20:36.064
spilling popcorn on your couch
and bugging you

20:36.095 --> 20:37.930
that you don't spend enough time with me

20:37.978 --> 20:40.211
even though you spend
all your time with me,

20:40.313 --> 20:43.915
and you'll be like, "When is she
gonna die already?"

20:44.017 --> 20:45.183
Thanks, Mama.

20:45.218 --> 20:48.219
You always know what to say
to make me feel better.
