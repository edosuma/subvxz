WEBVTT

01:42.697 --> 01:44.876
Another way I thought Eric had a call out.

01:44.876 --> 01:46.489
He got caught in traffic.

01:46.489 --> 01:47.611
Just him?

01:47.611 --> 01:48.859
Look at this place.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.910
They should fire the decorator.

01:51.294 --> 01:54.190
It sounds pay check could
have been the way they wanted it.

01:54.190 --> 01:55.967
I smell decomp.

01:56.322 --> 01:58.424
Yeah, neighbor thought
it was from the pipes.

01:58.424 --> 02:00.777
till a couple of hundreds
maggots fell on his head

02:01.345 --> 02:03.488
First officer pronounced 0800.

02:03.488 --> 02:05.918
we got ten dollars, credit cards,

02:06.087 --> 02:09.536
ID says her name is Peg Donovan
but the condo owner says her unit's vacant.

02:09.536 --> 02:12.659
Peg Donovan from Miami shores
it's over 10 miles from here.

02:12.659 --> 02:14.277
Alexx, what do we have?

02:14.482 --> 02:17.641
Massive head trauma.
pronounce sac mosses

02:17.641 --> 02:19.283
Probably blunt-force.

02:19.977 --> 02:22.259
Flies didn't waste any time, did they?

02:24.409 --> 02:27.217
Based on the life cycle live these blowflies.

02:27.217 --> 02:29.422
She's been here over 72 hours.

02:29.422 --> 02:31.901
72 hours. So she's been
here since monday.

02:34.342 --> 02:36.979
The corneas aren't clouded.

02:37.189 --> 02:39.046
Beautiful green eyes.

02:39.661 --> 02:41.217
Okay. Alexx, wait a second.

02:41.217 --> 02:43.201
Shouldn't those be clouded?

02:44.194 --> 02:47.074
Liver temper(ature) gives a closer TOD.

02:48.056 --> 02:51.744
Hang on a second. This woman has
perspiration on her checker.

02:55.977 --> 02:58.654
Oh, my god. / Alexx,

02:58.654 --> 03:00.202
She's still alive.

03:40.003 --> 03:41.678
MIAMI
2x03 Hard Time

03:48.233 --> 03:50.138
Peg, my name is lieutenant Horatio Caine,

03:50.138 --> 03:52.221
You are alright now, you're safe.

03:52.221 --> 03:53.777
Lieutenant, she's unconscious.

03:53.777 --> 03:54.923
I understand.

03:54.923 --> 03:57.293
Peg, I want you to take care now.

03:57.293 --> 03:58.679
Horatio. / Yeah,

03:58.679 --> 04:02.503
Alexx gave me peg's bag and
I found these on the inside.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.892
We got some OC spray
a whistle and a switchblade.

04:05.892 --> 04:08.624
Self defense and self preservation.
We all know what that means.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.003
- Means she is a rape victim.
- Two times a victim.

04:11.003 --> 04:12.996
She doesn't have bad luck.
She's got no luck at all.

04:12.996 --> 04:15.492
You know what?
Nobody could be this unlucky.

04:15.492 --> 04:16.894
Are you saying this is a reino?

04:16.894 --> 04:20.776
Somebody wants to think it is.
And nobody knows she's survived, right?

04:21.457 --> 04:23.132
I wanna play this is as a murder.

04:23.312 --> 04:25.795
All right, I'll pick it up. / Okay.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.889
So I missed all the excitement. huh?

04:41.673 --> 04:44.930
Thousand bodies under my belt
and I don't notice a live one.

04:44.930 --> 04:49.697
First officer didn't neither, I mean,
who can blame in a place smells like decomp

04:49.697 --> 04:51.511
covered in maggots.

04:53.139 --> 04:54.379
I'm an MD.

04:54.379 --> 04:56.115
Which means another difference.

04:59.344 --> 05:01.452
All right. doc. Explain this smell?

05:01.452 --> 05:02.577
It's from the blood pool.

05:02.577 --> 05:06.466
Not from tissue decay, girl
was almost clean as whistle.

05:06.466 --> 05:09.033
Techincal terms, maggot debridement.

05:09.033 --> 05:12.767
Flies are always first witness to a crime.
Smell blood from a mile away.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.429
The flies lay their eggs
and exposed worm.

05:15.429 --> 05:17.096
Which hatched to maggots

05:17.096 --> 05:18.756
Maggots ate the necrotic tissue,

05:18.756 --> 05:21.555
Killing any vacteria
preventing an infection.

05:21.555 --> 05:25.251
So the maggots kept her alive.

05:27.232 --> 05:29.250
I'll get this to our entomologist.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.829
Get us a time line.

05:31.629 --> 05:33.199
This?

05:33.199 --> 05:35.400
was delivered four days ago.

05:35.682 --> 05:39.356
And the spatter indicates that
it was delivered prior to the attack

05:46.560 --> 05:47.958
Hey.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.133
Thanks for the heads start.

06:06.425 --> 06:07.813
Lieutenant Caine. / Yeah.

06:07.813 --> 06:11.371
- You, wanted to her clothes for investigation?
- Yes, yes, doctor. Doctor?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.421
Were there any physical findings?

06:13.421 --> 06:14.995
Her skull's fractured.

06:14.995 --> 06:18.018
She's got subdural hematoma
and cerebral edema, but a..

06:18.018 --> 06:20.106
No. No evidence of rape.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.947
What are her chances realistically?

06:21.947 --> 06:24.558
Swolen on her brain goes down,
she might be okay.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.819
I told her she'd pull through.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.365
Aidment is not advertised lieutenant but...

06:29.365 --> 06:32.099
sometimes patients just hearing it can make it so.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.604
All right. Thank you. / Sure.

06:39.259 --> 06:41.935
This kleenex is good for DNA.

06:45.742 --> 06:49.317
Gotta be ten different shoe patterns here.

06:50.462 --> 06:53.705
I say photo them all and suit'em out later.

06:54.601 --> 06:56.591
Think this one gave me a bonus.

07:07.870 --> 07:11.675
Well, I don't need a scope this here.
There's scump of scalp here.

07:14.688 --> 07:17.043
The pounds per square inches to do that.

07:21.335 --> 07:23.380
Hey, look at that.

07:25.551 --> 07:27.863
Looks like the weapon hit the ceiling.

07:33.935 --> 07:37.529
So 2 by 4 construction site.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.109
It's a weapon of oppourtunity.

07:40.109 --> 07:45.010
So prior rape victim goes to a deserted
construction site is beaten and left for dead.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.741
There's no evidence that she was
taken in here against her will.

07:47.741 --> 07:50.043
I think she had to have come
with someone she trusted.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.284
Buenos dias?

07:55.284 --> 07:56.304
Hello.

07:56.304 --> 07:58.813
Do you have the where abouts of detective Hagon?

07:58.813 --> 08:00.651
He's running down the condo owner.

08:00.651 --> 08:04.335
Call the hand. Set you wanna run
Peg Donovan through the database?

08:04.335 --> 08:06.718
That's right.
We believe she was a rape victim.

08:06.764 --> 08:08.846
You mean in her past.

08:08.846 --> 08:11.608
Well, then she should be in here.

08:13.874 --> 08:18.171
Nothing locally. / Try state wide.
and a Jason State, please.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.391
Georgia.

08:22.439 --> 08:24.248
January 1st.

08:24.248 --> 08:25.520
I remember this case.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.549
Miami co-eds in the ball game.
Southern georgia.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.789
Rape January 1st by one Mason Shaw.

08:32.789 --> 08:37.938
Mason Shaw is convicted October 3rd.
Remained to the South Georgia Correctional Facility.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.734
15 years is a long time.

08:39.734 --> 08:42.195
When is Mason eligible for parole?

08:42.195 --> 08:45.893
Well, he had his first hearing October 2000.
Parole denied.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.704
Parole denied, okay.
When is his next hearing?

08:48.864 --> 08:51.181
October 2003, this month.

08:52.502 --> 08:54.040
This month.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.218
Did we just find our motive?

08:57.039 --> 08:58.957
- What are you thinking?
- Here's what I'm thinking.

08:58.957 --> 09:01.280
Somehow Peg..

09:01.471 --> 09:03.780
Peg is involved in these hearings.

09:08.499 --> 09:10.115
Hey, Celleigh. / Hey,

09:10.310 --> 09:13.306
Hey, listen. Thanks for taking
that evening call out of that condo.

09:13.306 --> 09:14.634
I really appreciated. / Sure.

09:14.634 --> 09:17.628
You know, traffic's a bitch
getting old to escape it(?).

09:18.193 --> 09:19.454
People say.

09:19.454 --> 09:20.836
Everything go okay?

09:20.836 --> 09:22.141
Ah... let's see.

09:22.141 --> 09:25.214
We may have a time line off some wood.

09:25.214 --> 09:29.522
We got some shoe prints.
Possible DNA off from kleenex.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.315
Oh and the dead girl wasn't dead.

09:32.583 --> 09:35.456
What? / Oh, she was hanging on by threat.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.475
You kidding.

09:40.901 --> 09:42.231
Where is she?

09:42.231 --> 09:43.858
Over at Grace Memorial.

09:43.858 --> 09:46.256
By the grace of god, I might add.

10:38.822 --> 10:40.888
- I appreciate the help.
- You welcome.

10:46.110 --> 10:48.369
Anything else you need, lieutenant.
You just let me know.

10:49.343 --> 10:50.678
Thank you, Sergent.

10:53.356 --> 10:55.505
Noticed how he tilt his neck to the left?

10:55.505 --> 10:57.672
Guy's stone deaf in his right ear

10:57.672 --> 11:00.080
To vain to wear his hearing aid.

11:00.344 --> 11:02.653
That guy behind the glass.

11:02.653 --> 11:05.427
He's into his book for a grand
The one next to him

11:05.427 --> 11:07.961
his wife's paying in his brother.

11:07.961 --> 11:09.587
Family scandle.

11:11.136 --> 11:12.637
Who else you want to know about?

11:12.637 --> 11:15.926
I would like to know about you.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.807
Mr. Shaw.

11:18.117 --> 11:20.935
Now Mr. Conroy of the parole board

11:20.935 --> 11:25.077
tells me you have very
very big hearing tomorrow.

11:26.135 --> 11:27.782
Got a good feeling about it.

11:27.782 --> 11:29.640
Very good.
It's important be confident.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.766
How do you feel about Peg Donovan?

11:34.718 --> 11:38.229
Peg Donovan. I understand that
she was at your hearing 3 years ago.

11:38.229 --> 11:40.219
And her testimony.

11:40.219 --> 11:42.912
Her testimony kept you behind bars.

11:43.568 --> 11:45.462
Yeah.

11:46.661 --> 11:48.973
I heard she's not gonna make it this time.

11:50.171 --> 11:52.588
That is quite true. Someone...

11:54.345 --> 11:56.976
Someone beat her to death at Miami.

11:57.781 --> 11:58.971
Tough break.

11:58.971 --> 12:02.289
Yes, it was.
Were you involved, Mr. Shaw?

12:03.196 --> 12:05.649
It's not possible man.

12:05.649 --> 12:07.554
Look at me.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.164
I'm behind bars.

12:11.748 --> 12:15.024
Why would that stop
a smart guy like you?

12:17.555 --> 12:19.064
Prove it.

12:19.226 --> 12:20.764
Working on it.

12:28.212 --> 12:31.555
Listen,I'm gonna run down on our rape
cell mates phone records and visitors.

12:31.555 --> 12:33.050
See what he's got in his back pocket.

12:33.050 --> 12:36.894
Okay, I've got some shoe prints that might be able
to help us, I'll show you when you get back?

12:36.894 --> 12:38.621
I'm not coming back any time soon.

12:38.621 --> 12:41.083
- You're not?
- Tomorrow is Shaw's parole in here.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.874
If it goes his way they're gonna
crack those gates immediately.

12:43.874 --> 12:45.099
Yeah, and you won't be there.

12:45.099 --> 12:47.171
And enough evidence to
put him right back in.

12:47.171 --> 12:49.311
Okay, working as fast we can.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.413
Take care.

12:53.225 --> 12:54.971
Drying out Peg's clothes?

12:55.399 --> 12:58.480
I can't process the evidence almost I do

12:59.312 --> 13:02.283
Wasn't she supposed to be
in court on that quadruple?

13:02.283 --> 13:04.603
Yeah, continuance.

13:04.603 --> 13:08.699
I looked up a file on Peg Donovan's
rape case from nine years ago.

13:09.579 --> 13:12.405
And Shaw, he didn't just rape her.

13:12.405 --> 13:14.221
He broke both of her arms.

13:14.221 --> 13:17.764
and she crawled out to the motel hall
where the maid found her.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.063
Her eye hanging out of it's socket.

13:21.371 --> 13:24.228
Tough girl. / Yeah.

13:24.228 --> 13:26.599
You know I flicked out
on the crime scene night?

13:26.751 --> 13:28.529
Yeah, but you know, you called and...

13:28.529 --> 13:30.468
Calleigh covered, so...

13:30.827 --> 13:32.359
Worked out.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.441
Yeah, but if Calleigh hadn't covered.

13:34.441 --> 13:36.409
It's up to me.
I mean she might have a died

13:37.285 --> 13:40.960
Guess it was.. Good thing it wasn't up to you.

13:41.370 --> 13:42.672
Anyway, what do you want me to say.

13:42.672 --> 13:45.319
Everyday it's like a suprise party with you.

13:45.738 --> 13:46.817
Here.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.694
So is Calleigh mad at you?

13:52.006 --> 13:54.198
I don't know, I can't tell.

13:54.527 --> 13:56.698
Well, she's probably mad at you.

14:04.362 --> 14:06.180
Hi,

14:06.351 --> 14:07.498
Got a bad guy in there?

14:07.498 --> 14:08.894
Maybe.

14:09.158 --> 14:10.684
Do you ever knock?

14:11.427 --> 14:13.542
You don't like guys who knock.

14:15.191 --> 14:18.902
I've got 3 unidentified heel prints for the distinct.

14:18.902 --> 14:20.578
Shefron pattern.

14:20.578 --> 14:23.306
I'm just waiting see what
the database's coming up with.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.436
Please, stop staring at me.

14:35.061 --> 14:37.507
Grip tread 2000.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.181
That should help.

14:39.181 --> 14:42.106
Oh, not really.
It's actually common has cold.

14:42.106 --> 14:43.583
So this heel gives us nothing?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.385
Only class characteristics.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.792
But the dirt I've recovered make it us more.

14:48.134 --> 14:50.378
Do you have something of your own detective?

14:50.772 --> 14:52.291
Oh, yeah.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.476
Seems our victim was a prisoner
in her own home.

14:55.476 --> 14:57.967
Worked there, lived there,
never adventured out.

14:57.967 --> 14:59.159
Except for this place.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.751
Three blocks from the crime scene.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.363
That's great. Okay.
I'll drop this off by trace

15:03.363 --> 15:05.774
on our way out.
Have Speedle run it.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.141
Ms. Arther?

15:14.361 --> 15:16.190
We spoke on the phone
about Peg Donovan.

15:16.190 --> 15:17.397
ID's please.

15:24.187 --> 15:26.054
Was Peg Donovan a regular?

15:26.153 --> 15:27.416
Never misses.

15:27.416 --> 15:28.813
Missed.

15:28.813 --> 15:31.174
We think she was killed
after the meeting, monday night.

15:31.274 --> 15:34.866
Do you document who attends? / No, it's
too confrentational for some of our members.

15:34.866 --> 15:36.715
Anyone new join the group recentely?

15:36.851 --> 15:39.265
One woman. Didn't ger her name.

15:39.454 --> 15:43.793
She did participated in the fast
defense training class that I teach.

15:43.793 --> 15:45.499
The one with MO guy suit.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.787
MO guy suit?

15:46.787 --> 15:49.111
Technical name.
Like the michelin man.

15:49.518 --> 15:52.708
This new woman
she volunteered to play my victim.

15:52.708 --> 15:55.441
I started the demonstration she freaked.

15:55.624 --> 15:57.239
Said it was too soon.

15:57.628 --> 15:58.573
Too soon?

15:58.573 --> 16:00.513
Since her attack.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.029
Peg tried to calm her down.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.678
Infact they left together.

16:05.301 --> 16:09.129
Wow, that makes this lady the closest
thing to have back down we've got.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.488
Would you mind getting the MO guy suit?

16:12.488 --> 16:14.444
We might be able to get DNA off of it.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.240
It's in the back.

16:40.028 --> 16:41.728
You still here, Caine?

16:41.856 --> 16:45.039
Hey, no talking in line
on the chain game.

16:46.728 --> 16:49.423
Hey, you wanna picture, Caine?

16:49.423 --> 16:51.890
One more day when I wake up and I'm out of here.

16:51.983 --> 16:53.483
You sure about that?

16:54.395 --> 16:56.017
Hey! Move it.

16:58.603 --> 17:02.473
Visitors all you want.
Fallen back 6 months. / Thank you.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.535
Hey, it's me. Listen.

17:28.535 --> 17:33.684
Making county is about to send us the transcript
and the court records for Shaw's 94 rape case.

17:33.684 --> 17:34.758
Here to Miami?

17:34.758 --> 17:37.567
Yeah, they'll only send it to my official address.

17:37.567 --> 17:40.686
Here's what I need. The original court
reporters, witnesses and jury members.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.731
Anybody connected to the trial.

17:43.276 --> 17:44.845
You have a suspect in mind?

17:44.845 --> 17:46.340
Yeah, I do.

17:52.017 --> 17:55.178
Got the DNA results from
the kleenex from the condo.

17:55.317 --> 17:57.085
No match to the victim.

17:57.422 --> 17:58.886
Okay.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.918
But it did match the DNA of the self-defensive.

18:01.918 --> 18:04.561
Okay, the mystery woman
was at the scene of the crime.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.834
That's good.
but she's still mystery woman.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.401
I'm just saying.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.321
Not a mystery woman for long.

18:13.321 --> 18:15.556
Horatio checked Shaw's visitor list.

18:15.556 --> 18:20.300
Lawyer, family, and no less
than 8 women who visit him regulary.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.056
That is so weird how certain
woman seek out criminal celebrity.

18:24.056 --> 18:25.827
Were we able to get any of the groovies?

18:25.827 --> 18:28.526
You need one?
Chrysal Sherwood.

18:28.526 --> 18:30.325
Guess how she met Shaw?

18:31.045 --> 18:33.842
Well, just when I think I've seen everything.

18:37.590 --> 18:40.632
According to our records you visit
Mason Shaw in prison every week.

18:41.897 --> 18:43.352
Feel bad for him.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.727
Losing everything.

18:44.727 --> 18:46.312
His wife walked down on him.

18:46.312 --> 18:47.907
He missing his son grow up.

18:47.907 --> 18:54.428
Did your sympathy for Mr. Shaw began
during or after you served as a jury on his trial?

18:55.082 --> 18:57.944
- How did you?
- Court records. Visitor logs.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.818
Mason Shaw and I fell in love after his trial.

19:00.818 --> 19:02.940
He was working you from the defense table.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.412
Guys like that always do.

19:04.412 --> 19:07.437
Mason's a sensitive guy.
A very sensitive guy.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.679
Yes, he's so sensitive in fact

19:09.679 --> 19:11.089
that he had Peg Donovan killed.

19:11.089 --> 19:13.803
So she couldn't appear
at his parole hearing tomorrow

19:16.416 --> 19:17.844
What? She's..

19:19.704 --> 19:22.392
The leader of the rapes support
group IDed you from photo.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.250
You have personated a rape victim to slayer Peg.

19:27.398 --> 19:29.941
You were the last person she was seen with.

19:30.111 --> 19:32.351
I know why I got so weird.

19:32.455 --> 19:36.069
Rape is over any moment.
memories last a life time.

19:36.588 --> 19:38.206
You wanna get some coffee?

19:38.322 --> 19:39.883
Talk?

19:40.787 --> 19:42.011
Okay.

19:43.578 --> 19:47.766
And I think we both know that sample you just
gave us is gonna place you at the crime scene.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.803
And you showed her your place,
Peg Donovan's antenna must have gone up.

19:51.803 --> 19:53.778
I'm remodeling.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.738
Security.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.009
I just took her there and left.

20:06.216 --> 20:08.519
Somebody used a 2 by 4.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.470
Not me. I swear.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.071
Could you stand up?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.684
Why? What's going on?

20:13.850 --> 20:16.185
Going to find out if you're telling the truth.

20:18.386 --> 20:22.654
I did all I had to do to destroyed the
pattern to identify the component to the soil.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.180
You already making excueses.

20:24.180 --> 20:26.732
I think it's all right.
Guess we're all same team.

20:26.732 --> 20:30.017
Hey, did you find anything instructive
in the dirt from the boot?

20:30.698 --> 20:33.993
Clay, hay, excrement and

20:33.993 --> 20:35.428
Onion? / Well,

20:35.559 --> 20:39.164
Yellow granic type F. hybrid onion specific.

20:39.164 --> 20:41.683
Horse get uncommon supermarket onions.

20:41.683 --> 20:42.528
That's what you got?

20:42.528 --> 20:45.083
Turns out there not so common.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.979
Sucrose of high concentration.

20:47.979 --> 20:51.267
Vidalia onions.

20:51.267 --> 20:55.303
There's only one place in the world
they grow the Southern County State of Georgia.

20:55.303 --> 20:57.763
That's where our suspect's?

21:36.950 --> 21:38.691
Nice boots.

21:38.691 --> 21:39.816
Officer Bailey.

21:39.816 --> 21:41.025
Your prisoners?

21:41.435 --> 21:45.702
So I'm told. I'm also told you you're
the only CO in the pestrian patrol.

21:47.397 --> 21:48.292
So?

21:48.292 --> 21:50.030
Ever been to Miami?

21:50.030 --> 21:51.038
No.

21:51.038 --> 21:53.398
Well, your boots say different Voila.

21:53.398 --> 21:54.989
You're coming with me.

22:04.337 --> 22:07.735
Well Roy, you broke the caught and rule, didn't you?

22:08.205 --> 22:09.844
What rule?

22:10.396 --> 22:12.394
Never...

22:12.589 --> 22:16.426
and I mean never let an inmate

22:16.557 --> 22:18.697
know anything about you, that rule.

22:18.697 --> 22:20.814
I do not fractionize with inmates.

22:20.814 --> 22:23.572
Really? I hear Roy,

22:23.572 --> 22:27.376
that your wife is expecting twins.
That must have been a shock?

22:27.548 --> 22:28.896
What is..?

22:29.022 --> 22:32.445
- Well, how do you know...
- I heard it from Shaw.

22:34.795 --> 22:37.079
Well, I never told Shaw, nothing.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.498
Did you kill Peg Donovan?

22:48.578 --> 22:49.448
Who?

22:49.448 --> 22:51.772
Come on. Roy..
Come on, this is a private prison.

22:51.772 --> 22:53.900
No training. Less salary.

22:53.900 --> 22:57.193
You are venerable on this area.
You have motive.

22:57.193 --> 22:59.896
Look, I told you. I've never been to Miami.

22:59.896 --> 23:01.494
And I was fishing on Monday.

23:01.494 --> 23:02.631
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.671
You're gonna let me look at your
bank deposits and may believe you.

23:05.671 --> 23:08.012
My bank deposits? / Yes. I wanna see

23:08.012 --> 23:10.679
if you supplementing your income.

23:10.679 --> 23:12.723
I think you're gonna have to get a warrent for that.

23:12.723 --> 23:14.620
Minutes away, Roy,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.575
Minutes away.

23:21.085 --> 23:22.884
Recognize him?

23:24.223 --> 23:26.816
He's one of the guards from Mason's prison.

23:26.816 --> 23:29.499
We found his boot prints at the crime scene.

23:30.590 --> 23:31.934
Is he the one that met you there?

23:31.934 --> 23:34.041
Did he beat Peg with 2 by 4?

23:34.513 --> 23:37.203
I told you I didn't even
know someone was there.

23:37.203 --> 23:40.663
I locked her in and I left.
That's all Mason ask me to do.

23:48.975 --> 23:52.173
I didn't know someone was gonna kill her.

23:56.249 --> 23:57.565
Speed, it's H

23:57.565 --> 23:58.727
Hey,

23:58.883 --> 24:01.437
Now listen,
Shaw has an eighteen year old son

24:01.437 --> 24:03.234
who just stopped visiting about a month ago.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.425
Were you able to see him?

24:04.425 --> 24:07.182
Nope, he is a freshman
at the University of Miami,

24:07.182 --> 24:08.553
Go get this face, will you?

24:08.553 --> 24:09.909
All right, I'll take a uniform.

24:38.231 --> 24:39.687
Chuck Shaw?

24:39.687 --> 24:41.556
Yeah, I got ten minutes left man.

24:44.634 --> 24:47.071
Well, maybe you can get your money back.

24:52.348 --> 24:53.821
What do you want?

24:55.091 --> 24:57.461
You seen Peg Donovan lately?

25:10.742 --> 25:13.696
I called her a few times.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.838
Is that why came down to Miami?

25:15.838 --> 25:18.759
No, I got a scholarship.

25:19.669 --> 25:21.152
Academic.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.404
Marine Biology.

25:22.404 --> 25:24.292
When's last time you saw her, Peg?

25:26.229 --> 25:28.608
Never,

25:28.760 --> 25:30.531
I told you I phoned her.

25:30.795 --> 25:34.010
My father is parole hearing is
coming up and I asked her to go easy.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.725
Shook things up last time she testified, huh?

25:37.635 --> 25:39.779
She told that story again?

25:39.779 --> 25:41.375
Those lies?

25:42.367 --> 25:44.146
About how my father raped her?

25:44.319 --> 25:45.909
Lies?

25:47.206 --> 25:49.172
I know my Dad cheat on my Mom.

25:49.693 --> 25:51.768
But it wasn't rape.

25:51.908 --> 25:53.692
It was just sex.

25:53.692 --> 25:55.500
Hey, Chuck do you have a..

25:55.500 --> 25:57.245
An allergy?

26:01.868 --> 26:03.719
It's a poison oak.

26:03.719 --> 26:05.722
It's pretty hard to get that down on Miami.

26:05.722 --> 26:07.446
It's really humid.

26:07.446 --> 26:09.722
You wanna try again?

26:12.319 --> 26:13.785
I don't remember.

26:13.785 --> 26:17.927
You know, it's all over your face
but it's not in your eyes.

26:17.927 --> 26:20.220
Mind if I take a sample of that?

26:21.180 --> 26:22.882
Go ahead.

27:00.446 --> 27:02.328
Okay.

27:02.328 --> 27:05.389
Burn on your face is
from pepper spray.

27:05.389 --> 27:10.611
Found 15% oleoresin capsicum
which is identical to...

27:10.611 --> 27:13.470
Peg Donovan's pepper spray, so...

27:13.470 --> 27:15.229
You attacked her.

27:15.722 --> 27:17.217
No.

27:17.362 --> 27:19.537
Well, do you wanna explain that?

27:22.707 --> 27:24.076
She was a..

27:24.076 --> 27:25.647
taking out the trash.

27:25.647 --> 27:26.855
Last week.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.846
I.. walked up to her.

27:30.420 --> 27:33.235
Told her to stop lying about my Dad.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.214
Hey, why want you do that...

27:39.712 --> 27:42.670
She just started... freaking out.

27:42.834 --> 27:45.383
Spraying at me so I ran.

27:48.183 --> 27:50.775
Crazy bitch.

27:53.527 --> 27:55.550
She ruin my whole family.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.622
How old are you when...

27:57.622 --> 27:59.721
your dad was arrested. Nine?

28:00.727 --> 28:02.840
Eight.

28:04.157 --> 28:06.731
Would you take a look at something?

28:12.864 --> 28:15.074
Those are photos of Peg's sexual assault.

28:15.074 --> 28:17.652
And the files related to the case.

28:17.854 --> 28:22.308
I want you to look at those. And I want you
to tell me that you think that's consenteral sex.

28:33.427 --> 28:37.606
Hi, I'm Calleigh Duquesne, Miami Dade CSI.

28:37.606 --> 28:40.478
Your doctor told us you were awake.

28:42.726 --> 28:45.330
Do you think you're up to
looking up some pictures?

28:55.204 --> 28:56.840
It's Crystal.

28:58.001 --> 29:00.273
She took me to her place.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.380
Locked me in.

29:09.661 --> 29:12.259
Crystal! Open the door!

29:15.413 --> 29:20.523
We believe that person that assaulted you
may have been waiting inside.

29:21.185 --> 29:23.898
Do you think you can look at one more?

29:24.109 --> 29:26.743
I didn't see anyone else.

29:27.228 --> 29:29.516
It's dark inside.

29:29.781 --> 29:31.503
Sorry.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.706
That's all right.

29:32.706 --> 29:34.552
Are you okay?

29:35.159 --> 29:38.614
Suppose to be somewhere.

29:38.816 --> 29:41.274
Just can't remember where.

30:19.636 --> 30:21.137
Are you finished?

30:24.726 --> 30:27.039
My crime scene re-construction

30:27.039 --> 30:29.189
indicates that you are tall enough

30:29.189 --> 30:32.369
to swing by that 2 by 4
to kill Peg Donovan.

30:32.493 --> 30:34.108
I didn't.

30:34.277 --> 30:35.329
I know.

30:35.329 --> 30:39.495
Homocide just found out you were
on a boat at the time of the murder.

30:39.966 --> 30:42.665
I mean Biology trip.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.694
I think my dad's planned me.

30:52.260 --> 30:54.687
It's all leaf running.

30:58.133 --> 31:00.291
He set me up.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.367
I... I think I might paid for him.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.330
What are you talking about?

31:06.512 --> 31:08.574
Peg Donovan's murder.

31:09.186 --> 31:15.082
My dad said if I brought him
a little money every week

31:15.170 --> 31:16.944
it would help.

31:16.944 --> 31:18.528
Keep these guys off him.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.346
Pay for his protection.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.787
All through High School
I brought him money.

31:22.942 --> 31:24.611
Prisoners aren't allowed to handle money.

31:24.611 --> 31:26.269
I know.

31:26.269 --> 31:30.243
I gave it to a CO to pass it to my Dad.

31:31.337 --> 31:33.400
I think he's name was...

31:33.400 --> 31:35.037
Bailey?

31:38.680 --> 31:40.743
Now you can collect this when you leave.

31:44.519 --> 31:46.485
How did you know?

31:47.135 --> 31:48.626
My boss.

31:50.214 --> 31:53.022
I just wanted to help my dad.

31:54.032 --> 31:55.984
I didn't know it was to kill her.

32:01.689 --> 32:03.496
I swear.

32:23.082 --> 32:25.199
Was low and overnight and
we're expecting temperature

32:25.199 --> 32:28.221
in the high 90's with 94% humidity.

32:28.221 --> 32:32.153
You're listen to WHGA Southern
Georgia's broadcast

32:32.153 --> 32:37.693
and now we're here from Roll Hagard..

32:39.005 --> 32:41.613
You want me to push his hearing back?

32:41.613 --> 32:43.860
Just until I can get my evidences together.

32:43.860 --> 32:48.308
Parole hearing is to ask subtain
whether he paid his debt to the society.

32:48.308 --> 32:51.343
It is not to prosecute for a second alleged attack.

32:51.343 --> 32:53.832
I understand that but I can't file a new case yet.

32:53.832 --> 32:55.694
Drag your heels.

32:55.894 --> 33:00.400
The State of Georgia doesn't cut
in the dragging heels for the State of New Jersey.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.897
I'm sorry. State of Florida.

33:03.843 --> 33:05.180
So what you're telling me

33:05.180 --> 33:09.913
is that you are comfortable putting a violent
sex offender back out on the street?

33:10.293 --> 33:12.957
If the board so determines.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.315
But you are the senior member of the board.

33:14.315 --> 33:15.684
You can make this happen.

33:15.684 --> 33:17.744
What we have here

33:17.744 --> 33:20.733
is a failure to communicate.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.053
I always like that movie.

33:24.194 --> 33:25.566
Me too.

33:25.843 --> 33:29.451
Shaw's hearing is at 4:30.

33:29.451 --> 33:30.824
Today.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.039
I'll be here.

34:21.052 --> 34:23.705
There's gotta be something that ties this case to Shaw.

34:24.454 --> 34:26.804
I gonna have to go back over the evidence.

34:26.804 --> 34:28.009
Okay.

34:28.009 --> 34:29.792
2 by 4,

34:29.792 --> 34:32.036
Heel print,

34:32.036 --> 34:35.902
Clothes. / Emergency room is
not the medical examiner.

34:35.902 --> 34:37.309
You got stress or some?

34:37.309 --> 34:39.803
No, when a victim goes to morgue

34:39.803 --> 34:42.197
the ME bags and tags everything, right?

34:42.197 --> 34:44.533
Find tooth comb,
cause it's evidence.

34:44.533 --> 34:46.786
- The ER on the other hand..
- It's only concern who's saving lives

34:46.786 --> 34:51.463
not concerned with the evidence. / Exactly.
And the ER doctor's must have been all over Peg.

34:51.463 --> 34:54.041
- We have head trauma,
- Move it. move it, come on.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.172
All right, all right.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.483
Losing blood.

34:58.749 --> 35:00.395
Okay, cut away, come on...

35:09.244 --> 35:11.469
Clothes are drying out on the evidence. huh?

35:18.753 --> 35:20.585
Yo! Check this out.

35:21.766 --> 35:24.169
Cell phone. Emergency situation.

35:24.169 --> 35:27.616
Yeah, the ER nurse must have hid it
in there to keep it from getting lost.

35:32.243 --> 35:33.626
Check the history.

35:33.887 --> 35:35.185
Yeap.

35:35.359 --> 35:39.461
Here we got a 911 call made
9:44 on monday night.

35:39.461 --> 35:42.994
Well, that make sense. I would use
a cell phone over pepper spray any day.

35:42.994 --> 35:45.541
And the PD didn't get us any tapes from 911.

35:45.541 --> 35:47.134
Well, maybe the call didn't get through?

35:47.134 --> 35:49.158
We have to go though being the cold memory.

35:49.158 --> 35:50.218
Well maybe it got dropped.

35:50.218 --> 35:52.302
Either way, we know
what time the call was made.

35:52.302 --> 35:54.876
Let's get the tape and see what we can hear.

35:55.163 --> 35:59.422
So dispatch recorded
one 911 hangup at 9:44.

35:59.422 --> 36:01.250
Nobody on the other line.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.698
See if there's anything in the background.

36:03.836 --> 36:06.088
Yes, let's give it a try.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.096
911. What's your emergency?

36:09.441 --> 36:10.903
What was that?

36:11.665 --> 36:13.773
Let me try to isolate the sound.

36:19.187 --> 36:20.716
It sounds like electronic.

36:20.716 --> 36:25.279
Yeah. 140 decibels probably
radio frequency interference.

36:25.423 --> 36:28.943
The crime scene was a constrution site
I didn't see anything electronic.

36:28.943 --> 36:31.223
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe it was outside or next door?

36:31.223 --> 36:34.984
Yeah. Had to been pretty close to react
with the frequency in the cell phone.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.952
Okay, how close?

36:35.952 --> 36:37.125
In the room.

36:37.125 --> 36:39.304
One or two feet away from the phone.

36:39.304 --> 36:42.880
So she got locked in the room and
she grabbed her cell phone to make the call.

36:53.473 --> 36:58.552
And if the electronic device was within
a foot of her at that time it had be on the suspect.

37:01.254 --> 37:03.194
911.What's your emergency...

37:05.896 --> 37:07.961
An electronic device?

37:07.961 --> 37:09.671
Interfered with her cell phone.

37:09.671 --> 37:11.116
Okay. Cell phone.

37:11.116 --> 37:12.700
What kind of cell phone exactly?

37:12.700 --> 37:14.814
It's a turbo cell TC-90.

37:14.814 --> 37:17.154
Tyler said he can match
the sound on the tape.

37:17.154 --> 37:20.208
If we find a electronic device her
attacker was carrying.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.149
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

37:22.149 --> 37:24.592
Have him get his gear and you two
get up here immediately,

37:24.592 --> 37:25.908
Immediately, Eric.

37:26.721 --> 37:28.296
They told me you looking for me.

37:28.453 --> 37:30.303
Yeah, I'm a...

37:30.303 --> 37:33.236
I'm having trouble deciphering these visitor logs.

37:34.962 --> 37:36.428
See what I can do.

37:36.606 --> 37:38.298
Appreciate it.

37:43.843 --> 37:45.385
Allow me to take a look at these.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.230
New phone, huh?

37:49.230 --> 37:51.882
Yeah, it's a...

37:51.882 --> 37:54.699
It has this artist ring.

37:54.781 --> 37:56.329
Do you wanna hear it?

37:57.765 --> 37:59.443
Ahh, god!

38:08.144 --> 38:09.642
See what I mean?

38:13.030 --> 38:16.102
Here's the bottom line sergeant,
we can prove that your hearing aid was

38:16.102 --> 38:20.763
within inches of Peg Donovan cell phone
while she was being attacked.

38:21.947 --> 38:23.812
I never meant the hit her that hard.

38:24.458 --> 38:25.848
It was that noise.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.541
911, What's your..

38:50.864 --> 38:52.555
Why did you try implicate Bailey?

38:52.555 --> 38:56.501
He tried implicate Bailey because he could, right sarge?

38:56.576 --> 38:58.009
I knew Bailey had two days off.

38:58.009 --> 38:59.942
And you are access to his boots.

39:10.051 --> 39:13.637
I knew you was taking money from Shaw
which would make him the perfect patency.

39:13.637 --> 39:15.159
Here's a thing I can figure out, though.

39:15.159 --> 39:18.518
I can prove through your bank statement
that you aren't taking money.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.541
So what does he have on you?

39:34.658 --> 39:36.366
There was this woman.

39:37.427 --> 39:41.206
She was there on the conjugal,
I guess her old man couldn't deliver.

39:51.043 --> 39:53.079
I didn't wanna lose my job.

39:54.456 --> 39:57.211
And my... my wife.

40:01.130 --> 40:03.882
Shaw said we'd be even if I did him a favor.

40:04.795 --> 40:07.044
Shaw said.

40:11.468 --> 40:13.645
Take a look at that.

40:16.615 --> 40:20.670
That was some favor, sarge.

40:26.907 --> 40:29.973
Estimated on a parole board is in the...

40:30.402 --> 40:33.884
In the matter of inmate number 41720.

40:34.041 --> 40:36.340
- Welcome back.
- It's good to be here, sir.

40:36.528 --> 40:38.333
Before we proceed,

40:38.333 --> 40:40.900
Lieutenant Caine has requested a word.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.764
Thank you. Mason Shaw you are under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder

40:44.764 --> 40:47.727
and attempted murder of a witness.

40:47.727 --> 40:49.851
Attempted?

40:51.040 --> 40:53.175
You told me she was dead.

40:53.175 --> 40:55.462
Well, I guess I miss led you huh?

40:56.503 --> 40:59.594
How does it feel to be kept in the dark?

41:00.248 --> 41:02.943
I should have been improvised of this
before the hearing, Caine.

41:02.943 --> 41:06.895
So I apologies for that. But that's the
problem with these places is loose lips.

41:06.895 --> 41:11.144
This is a notice of extradition signed
by the State's attorney of Florida.

41:11.144 --> 41:14.487
You my friend, are about to stand trial.
Get up,

41:14.487 --> 41:15.966
Get up!

41:18.832 --> 41:21.317
I'll be acquited.

41:21.702 --> 41:23.511
You got nothing.

41:24.100 --> 41:25.649
On the contrary,

41:25.649 --> 41:31.722
I have confessions from every major
player including your son,

41:33.691 --> 41:36.014
Your son.

41:37.165 --> 41:40.793
You see Mason, the problem of manipulation

41:40.793 --> 41:43.939
is that people can turn on you.

41:47.688 --> 41:51.143
Well, Shaw. This hearing is over.

41:51.290 --> 41:54.506
And what maybe the biggest
understate of my career,

41:54.506 --> 41:56.591
Parole denied.

42:11.581 --> 42:14.122
You're the one that found me.

42:17.058 --> 42:18.613
That's right.

42:19.213 --> 42:21.370
That's right. How're you feeling?

42:22.966 --> 42:25.280
Scared.

42:26.736 --> 42:28.650
They told me you got him.

42:28.799 --> 42:30.218
You know what, Peg?

42:30.218 --> 42:31.440
We did.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.363
We got him.

42:35.388 --> 42:37.629
How long do I have?

42:39.322 --> 42:42.352
Peg, he's never getting out.

42:42.523 --> 42:44.522
Never, no parole.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.596
No parole?

42:47.596 --> 42:49.004
Nope.

42:49.004 --> 42:50.796
Never.

42:54.926 --> 42:55.867
What?

42:55.867 --> 42:57.474
Don't worry.

42:57.474 --> 42:59.095
It's okay.

43:00.632 --> 43:01.682
Sorry.

43:01.682 --> 43:03.631
There you go, no big deal.

43:10.307 --> 43:12.849
I'm still scared.

43:13.575 --> 43:15.466
I know.

43:15.941 --> 43:17.708
I know.
