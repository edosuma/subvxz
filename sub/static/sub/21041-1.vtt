My client, Mr Lawton,

02:31.440 --> 02:33.190
was tried and found guilty,

02:33.240 --> 02:36.070
first by the press and
then by social media.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.390
It made his life a living
hell for over two years.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.910
It took less than a day, today,
for the truth to come out.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.070
He should never have been arrested.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.190
He should never have
been brought to trial.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.240
That's the truth.

Dear Miss Banville.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.360
My son, Jason, turned 14 today.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.000
His father is Kevin Russell,

03:11.920 --> 03:13.600
who you have probably heard of.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.030
Kevin's been in prison for 14 years,

03:21.080 --> 03:22.480
all of Jason's life.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.550
I'm writing to ask if you
will look at Kevin's case,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.920
because I know he didn't kill that girl.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.240
I've talked to other
lawyers and got nowhere.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.590
I have to try one more time

03:37.640 --> 03:38.910
because I owe it to Jason

03:38.960 --> 03:41.230
to prove that his dad isn't a killer.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.600
That he's a good man.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.520
Please, help us find the truth.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.910
- Hi, Miriam.
- Good morning.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.950
I'm gonna be out all day today.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.990
You should stay with
Karim, just to be safe.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.310
OK.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.800
Yeah, and Steve'll be up.
He'll be up eventually.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.350
- Emma.
- Hi, Annie.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.440
I'm so grateful, I can't tell you.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.190
- You all right?
- You know the rules.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.840
No touching.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.630
Jason sends his love.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.510
Be nice to see him.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.350
He'll come next time, I promise.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.550
So, Kevin, this is Emma Banville,
the lawyer I told you about.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.510
She's agreed to look at your case.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.350
- How much is she costing you?
- She's doing it for free.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.990
Oh, great, a stupid lawyer.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.640
Kevin, she's come all this way.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.790
OK. So what do you wanna know?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.550
Can you leave us, please?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.120
Not allowed, sorry.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.550
I'm his solicitor. It is allowed.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.830
- And are those cameras off?
- Yeah.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.150
Cos if they're not, and anything said
in here gets leaked to the press...

06:02.200 --> 06:04.040
- They're off.
- Thank you.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.630
- Go on, then.
- Did you murder Linda Simms?

06:15.680 --> 06:18.590
- No, I did not.
- So why did you confess to it?

06:18.640 --> 06:22.230
Because I was tired and scared
and she never let up on me. Never.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.110
"She." Detective Inspector Greenwood?

06:24.160 --> 06:27.360
By the time she'd finished I'd have
confessed to killing my own mum.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.830
Kevin, how can you confess to
something you know you didn't do?

06:31.880 --> 06:34.710
You haven't heard of
coerced confessions, Emma?

06:34.760 --> 06:38.310
Take a scared kid, mess with his head, you
can put any words you want in his mouth.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.150
That's what she did to me. Told me
how I did it, where I did it, and why.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.390
You were 23. Not a kid.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.590
And most coerced
confessions get thrown out.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.550
Yours wasn't.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.990
You know why?

06:50.040 --> 06:54.470
Because they had good lawyers and I had shit
lawyers and it looks like that ain't gonna change.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.520
Kevin!

06:59.680 --> 07:01.350
Is there anything new you can give me?

07:01.400 --> 07:04.400
Anything about the case,
anything about the investigation.

07:04.900 --> 07:09.190
I already told 'em everything. The
police, the lawyers, the court.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.950
I had a good job. Then my girl, she's pregnant,
we're looking forward to our first kid

07:14.000 --> 07:16.670
and then I get accused of killing
a girl I don't even know.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.190
A witness saw you talk to her
the night she disappeared.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.750
At a school disco with 200 kids.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.870
I didn't kill her. If you think
I did, then why are you here?

07:23.920 --> 07:26.390
Cos Annie believes you
didn't and she convinced me.

07:26.440 --> 07:30.640
But without new evidence I'm never gonna
get your case before the Review Commission.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.510
So...

07:34.560 --> 07:36.590
think, Kevin.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.880
Is there anything new you can give me?

07:47.520 --> 07:50.000
No. There's nothing new.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.390
- Steady on. You done?
- Yeah, we're done.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.440
I'll bring Jason next time, Kev.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.910
You know what that police woman said?

08:02.960 --> 08:06.830
She said if I confessed, it would
help me in court and with my boy.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.110
When did she say that to you?

08:08.160 --> 08:12.710
But it didn't help me in court and
it didn't help me with my boy
because he's been to see me twice

08:12.760 --> 08:15.150
in the last six years and
he obviously hates my guts.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.790
None of this is in the
transcripts. When did she say that?

08:17.840 --> 08:19.350
So I guess she lied.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.270
Police lie to get a conviction.
Is that new enough for you?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.120
When did she say that to you? When?

09:54.680 --> 09:57.670
Even if his confession's thrown
out, the forensics convict him.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.430
Why waste your time going to see him?

09:59.480 --> 10:02.910
Cos of Kevin's ex-fiancee. She
never gave up on him. Ever.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.030
Annie who was pregnant
at the time of the murder

10:05.080 --> 10:07.590
and married someone else the
second Kevin was locked up?

10:07.640 --> 10:11.510
Annie who tried to get over 40 law
firms to take a look at Kevin's case.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.950
She married because the
child needed a father.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.110
- Who wasn't a paedophile.
- Sexual activity was never conclusively...

10:17.160 --> 10:18.840
- Oh, come on...
- Ladies, please.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.520
Emma, why do you want
to continue with this?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.880
Because the confession is questionable...

10:26.880 --> 10:29.870
The IO might have questioned him
outside PACE, which is a breach...

10:29.920 --> 10:31.510
A technicality. The forensics...

10:31.560 --> 10:34.870
Were done by Galion labs, which
is owned by a bunch of ex-coppers,

10:34.920 --> 10:39.880
who have been investigated at least six times
and have had four convictions overturned.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.350
Dad, taking on Kevin Russell will
bring us nothing but ridicule.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.510
- It certainly won't make us any money.
- You're right, Maggie.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.030
This firm has always
preferred ridicule to money.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.910
I don't know how we're still in business.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.160
Well, we won't be much longer.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.440
Just a few more days.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.270
PACE tapes? You're really gonna
put yourself through that torture?

11:04.320 --> 11:06.760
Kevin said Greenwood put
words into his mouth.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.110
"Where I did it, how I did it and why."

11:11.160 --> 11:15.310
Olivia Greenwood was the investigating officer?
You know she's in counter-terrorism now?

11:15.360 --> 11:16.670
- SO-15?
- Graduate entry.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.670
This would've been one of her first cases.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.710
There you go: inexperienced copper,
desperate to make her mark.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.670
She won't like you messing with it.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.990
You're probably already on her dartboard with
your new house guest, what's her name, Miriam.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.030
What's her husband up to now?

11:30.080 --> 11:34.110
Dr Attar is in a refugee
camp on the Syrian border,

11:34.160 --> 11:37.360
and, yes, SO-15 have an
arrest warrant out on him.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.230
- Sorry.
- It's Ruby.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.680
She's in the middle of
London. Why's she gone dark?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.960
Oh, her. What's her last location?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.750
Ealing, somewhere.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.910
Father's in hospital there.
Pacemakers, etc. Don't sweat it.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.110
Who is she?

12:19.160 --> 12:21.710
Why hasn't she got a phone
with GPS like a normal person?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.760
Because she's slippery.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.120
I was in East Anglia today and
I went past the place where...

12:54.320 --> 12:56.600
.. where my unravelling started.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.880
That's hard to remember.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.240
Like it never happened.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.510
But it did, didn't it?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.020
Emma?

13:17.720 --> 13:20.800
He actually ate something
today, which is good.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.480
How's work?

13:26.480 --> 13:30.000
Defending any more sex
offenders or mad mullahs?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.590
We all have a right to a lawyer, Mum.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.240
Yes, but why does it
always have to be you?

13:37.960 --> 13:40.630
I'm worried about you, Em.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.280
You're getting on. No
husband, no family...

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
Emma...

13:55.960 --> 13:57.920
I'm so sorry.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.560
I'm sorry.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.710
Hamid. Thanks for meeting me.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.310
Have you got your phone?

15:10.360 --> 15:11.750
No, I left it in my car.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.400
Good. I don't want the spooks
using it as a microphone.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.110
When it comes to Syria, there's no such
thing as client/lawyer confidentiality.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.760
Oh, I understand, believe me.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.480
Ruby back on yet?

15:24.480 --> 15:27.400
Been a while. Tell 15. They
might want to do a bump.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.030
Greenwood.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.360
Your uncle Yusef is not making
life easy for me, or for his wife.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.240
I heard about Miriam. It's
good of you to take her in.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.470
She has family in America but what
chance of getting there now, huh?

15:47.520 --> 15:49.510
That's why he has to come home.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.190
He hired me to stop the police from
harassing him, then he disappears into Syria?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.950
- I mean, what's he thinking?
- He's not on holiday, you know.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.990
They're desperate for doctors out there.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.150
When Aleppo fell, there were less than 20.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.390
20 for quarter of a million people.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.360
Can you contact him?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.550
It's difficult, but... yeah.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.230
You need to tell him
Miriam is alone and afraid.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.310
You tell him he has to come home and then
we'll go to the police and we'll sort it out.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.510
OK?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.560
OK.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.590
He's a good man, Emma.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.390
Yeah.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.430
He has to be a good husband, too.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.780
Besides, I'd quite like to keep at
least one of my clients out of jail.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.360
- Good night.
- Be careful.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.630
Know why we stopped you?

17:10.680 --> 17:12.750
You're doing 40 in a 30 mile-an-hour zone.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.589
I wasn't.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.869
Since when do detectives do traffic stops?

17:16.920 --> 17:19.190
You mean instead of
catching the real criminals?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.710
I know you don't catch the real
criminals. Why did you stop me?

17:22.760 --> 17:24.589
It's the company you keep.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.800
What? What do you mean,
the company I keep?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.600
What do you mean...?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.600
You mind how you go.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.600
What are your names?

18:01.800 --> 18:02.910
Emma.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.320
Hi, Miriam. You must be hungry.

18:06.560 --> 18:11.680
- I made some food. I can heat it up.
- Oh, no. Er, a stiff drink is what I need.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.950
I know, I'm a lost cause.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.790
Not to me.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.830
Speaking of lost causes, where is Steve?

18:20.880 --> 18:22.430
In the pub.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.600
Er, he said for you to join him.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.870
I met Yusef's nephew today, Hamid.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.480
He can get a message to
him. I told him to come home.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.990
I hope he will. I really hope.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.430
You think he won't?

18:40.480 --> 18:42.360
I know how important his work is.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.590
Maybe I should go to him.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.830
Maybe I should take Karim and just go.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.990
No. That'll get you both into trouble.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.470
The police are just waiting
for you to make a mistake.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.750
What have I done? I was thrown out of my
flat, I'm forbidden to go to my husband...

18:58.800 --> 18:59.910
What have I done?

18:59.960 --> 19:03.160
Look, they just suspect anyone who's
got ties with Syria, that's all.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.070
It'll be fine.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.480
Yusef will be back. But
until then, just be careful.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.630
Now, you remember what to say if they ask?

19:12.680 --> 19:14.680
"I want my lawyer."

19:15.600 --> 19:17.030
"I want my lawyer."

19:17.080 --> 19:19.080
Good.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.560
And teach the baby, too.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.830
'This is Detective Inspector Olivia
Greenwood, Bury St Edmunds police station.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.760
It's February 3rd, 9:11am.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.110
Present in the room with me is Kevin Russell,
and Mr Russell's solicitor, Raymond Blackwell.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.960
Kevin, as you know, Linda Simms, a pupil
at the school where you work, is missing.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.510
We have a witness who
says she saw you with Linda

20:04.560 --> 20:07.230
outside the school disco
on Saturday night.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.040
- That's not true.
- I think it is true.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.470
We're searching your home
and your workshop right now.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.630
But that'll upset Annie. They
can't upset Annie. She's pregnant.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.680
Hiya, love. Working hard?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.790
I'm afraid I woke Miriam.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.830
- Oh, no...
- No, no, don't worry.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.870
Not the kid, though.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.520
How long are they gonna
be camping on our couch?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.270
Until I can find them
another place to live.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.190
How was the pub?

20:39.240 --> 20:40.960
You were missed.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
Love you.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.950
But that'll upset Annie. They
can't upset Annie. She's pregnant.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.430
How upset do you think
Linda's parents are?

20:57.480 --> 21:00.430
Where is she, Kevin? Where is she?

21:00.480 --> 21:04.110
- I don't know.
- A witness saw you with her.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.440
- Linda's friend saw you.
- I don't know.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.990
It's been 48 hours, Kevin. You
know what that means, don't you?

21:12.040 --> 21:13.150
No.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.590
It means we're beginning to lose hope, so if
you know anything, now's the time to talk...

21:18.640 --> 21:21.840
- I don't know anything.
- You were the last person to see Linda alive.

21:23.280 --> 21:28.320
Where is she, Kevin? Please. Help
yourself, before it's too late.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.720
DI Greenwood, Bury St Edmunds police
station, February 7th, 1:05am.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.030
You should have talked to me, Kevin.
You should have told the truth.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.590
- What do you mean?
- We found Linda.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.640
Her body. Buried 20
yards from your workshop.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.270
And we've got enough to put
you away basically forever.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.350
Do you want that, Kevin?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.270
Now, Linda... she was knocked out.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.390
She was put into the ground unconscious.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.470
She woke up in the
ground, trying to breathe.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.080
Those were her last moments on earth.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.910
She was in your workshop, wasn't she?

22:16.960 --> 22:23.830
There were strands of her hair, fibres
from her clothes found here, here...

22:23.880 --> 22:25.870
there, there.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.040
She was in your workshop,
wasn't she, Kevin?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.440
Wasn't she?

22:32.440 --> 22:33.880
Wasn't she?

22:36.800 --> 22:38.040
Yes.

22:39.720 --> 22:43.150
You don't have to tell us
what you did, we already know.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.200
Linda was hit twice.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.390
A blow to her legs, hard
enough to break bones,

22:48.440 --> 22:50.430
and a blow to her head, knocking her out.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.480
So what did you hit her with?

22:54.640 --> 22:56.200
What did you hit her with?

22:57.320 --> 22:59.360
I didn't.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.830
There's enough here for
a jury to convict you.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.270
I didn't do it.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.350
But the question is, what
will they convict you of?

23:10.400 --> 23:11.680
Cold-blooded murder?

23:12.880 --> 23:15.110
Or of getting out of your depth?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.550
Panicking.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.790
Accidentally killing the person
that you actually had feelings for.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.230
So you had to get rid of the body.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.670
How did you get rid of the body?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.990
- I don't know.
- You don't know, Kevin?

23:26.040 --> 23:30.750
We all can understand fear and panic,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.230
but you need to tell us the truth,

23:32.280 --> 23:34.070
you need to tell us what happened.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.000
If you want the jury to feel sympathy
for you, you have to be honest.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
What did you hit her with?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.030
The shovel.

23:54.080 --> 23:57.920
- You hit Linda with a shovel?
- Yes.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.240
And where did you hit her
first? What part of her body?

24:16.040 --> 24:18.030
Her legs.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.600
You knocked her down, and then?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.670
Head.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.710
Her head.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.760
You hit her on the head?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.500
That's enough.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.190
My client needs a break.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.920
Your client needs a fucking lawyer.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.680
You knocked her down and then...?

25:29.720 --> 25:30.330
Head.

25:31.880 --> 25:32.770
Her head.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.720
You hit her on the head?

25:39.080 --> 25:40.910
It's clear from the silences on the tape.

25:40.960 --> 25:46.590
Greenwood had the crime scene photos
on the table, showing Kevin what to say.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.310
She's actually pointing to the answers.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.950
She led him.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.630
She put words into his mouth.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.070
At the very least, I can get
the confession thrown out.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.270
- I want to have a look at
the forensics. - I checked.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.520
His lawyers don't have them. Only
obliged to keep them six years.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.830
What can we do?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.110
Go to Bury St Edmunds station where
Kevin was originally questioned,

26:07.160 --> 26:08.800
pray to God they kept the files.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.870
You wanna look at what case?

26:16.920 --> 26:20.000
Er, Linda Simms, February 2003.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.600
February 2003? Not a problem.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.190
This is DS Hammond.

26:28.240 --> 26:33.240
Drop everything and find a case file
from 2003 for a solicitor from London...

26:34.120 --> 26:36.070
What? You're too busy?

26:36.120 --> 26:38.110
Crimes to solve?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.150
OK.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.670
Sorry. You should have called.
Saved yourself a drive.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.510
Er, I'm not going anywhere
until I see Linda Simms' file.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.070
It's my right.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.390
Put your request in writing,
I'll see what I can do.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.270
The only thing I'll be putting in writing

26:52.320 --> 26:55.670
is a letter to the Complaints Commission
about your obstructive attitude.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.190
You're that lawyer, aren't you?

26:57.240 --> 26:59.950
What's wrong, not getting
any headlines recently?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.630
Wanna kick up a stink?

27:01.680 --> 27:03.270
Is there a stink to kick up?

27:03.320 --> 27:06.510
The case number is O21464487.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.390
The files'll be in your storage
facility outside Thetford.

27:09.440 --> 27:13.120
Had a cold case inquiry here six years
ago. The facility was immaculate.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.790
- You're a copper.
- Was.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.640
And now you work with her?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.800
Ha. We all make mistakes.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.600
This is a non-smoking room.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.240
Not any more.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.790
What are we looking for exactly?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.840
Don't know. Anything untoward.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.200
Anything... untoward.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.640
Interesting.

27:56.760 --> 28:01.560
Evidence of sexual activity that night
was inconclusive, but she wasn't a virgin.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.910
I want to go out there tomorrow.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.840
To the school where she was found.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.480
Anyway, time for bed.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.960
Right, which side do you want?

28:22.440 --> 28:24.590
What? Can't I have my own room?

28:24.640 --> 28:26.800
Sure. If you pay for it.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.270
Daddy!

29:29.540 --> 29:32.660
Fragments of her clothes,
fragments of her hair...

30:00.180 --> 30:02.260
There's no conifers.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.900
Not one.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.770
I read the autopsy report last night.

30:08.820 --> 30:15.210
In Linda's hair there was sand,
plant fragments... and pine needles.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.260
Could have been cut down.

30:18.420 --> 30:21.450
There weren't any in the
crime scene photos either.

30:21.500 --> 30:25.290
And the same plant fragments were
in her trachea and her lungs.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.700
How can she inhale
something that isn't here?

30:29.860 --> 30:32.940
- Oh, dear. Linda's family.
- How the hell did they know?

30:34.140 --> 30:36.130
Oh, Christ...

30:39.380 --> 30:40.890
- Emma Banville?
- Yes.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.930
I'm Linda Simms' dad, Charlie.

30:42.980 --> 30:46.570
This is her mum, Beth. Her uncle,
Phil. What are you doing here?

30:46.620 --> 30:48.410
I'm taking a look at the case.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.130
- Why would you want to do that?
- I've been asked to.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.970
Who by?

30:53.020 --> 30:54.730
I'm sorry, that's confidential.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.770
It's that mad cow Annie Peterson.

30:56.820 --> 31:00.690
Cos every time she gets a lawyer digging it
up, it's like she kills Lin all over again.

31:00.740 --> 31:03.130
- I'm really sorry...
- Sorry?

31:03.180 --> 31:05.170
You've no idea.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.170
My baby's in the ground,
nothing to breathe...

31:08.220 --> 31:10.210
I wake up screaming.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.250
Why are you doing this to us?

31:12.300 --> 31:14.490
We're asking you nicely.

31:14.540 --> 31:15.650
Right?

31:15.700 --> 31:17.700
Just stay away.

31:20.660 --> 31:24.930
If you don't want to live through this
again, why have you invited the press?

31:24.980 --> 31:28.580
Cos we don't want you here.
So why don't you piss off?

31:32.060 --> 31:34.170
Yeah?

31:44.940 --> 31:48.090
I want to get a copy of the autopsy
report to an independent lab.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.570
Karen Buxton, probably.

31:49.620 --> 31:52.930
- You think you have enough?
- Yeah, a major forensic anomaly.

31:52.980 --> 31:56.130
- Is it worth the grief?
- What?

31:56.180 --> 31:58.610
I should back down because
of a bunch of vigilantes?

31:58.660 --> 32:00.660
Their daughter was murdered.

32:02.220 --> 32:05.220
And Kevin Russell's been
in prison for 14 years.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.210
That damn journalist.

32:09.260 --> 32:13.500
I can just see the headlines:
"Banville defends another paedophile."

32:14.780 --> 32:18.290
Emma, you never read the papers,
never watch TV. Why would you care?

32:18.340 --> 32:20.340
Because...

32:23.820 --> 32:25.530
.. because at the moment I do.

32:25.580 --> 32:26.860
But why?

32:28.060 --> 32:30.660
I just don't want that kind
of publicity at the moment.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.570
I'm trying to adopt.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.610
- You?
- Yeah, me.

32:37.660 --> 32:41.740
I've got a home, an income,
a steady relationship.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.090
Hm, steady-ish.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.130
Why now?

32:46.180 --> 32:48.170
Is it cos your dad's dying?

32:48.220 --> 32:50.220
No.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.660
I don't know.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.260
It's just all this carelessness and lies.

33:02.820 --> 33:04.820
It's been my life for so long.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.220
Just need something else.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.890
Quick, quick, quick.

33:13.940 --> 33:15.850
- Have you done your homework?
- Yeah.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.660
Have a good day. Bye.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.340
Have a good day.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.740
I got the bread... and this.

33:25.460 --> 33:27.210
- Oh, no.
- You put him in the news again.

33:27.260 --> 33:29.330
You're sick, you know that?

33:29.380 --> 33:31.780
I've gotta go to school.
I've gotta live with this.

33:38.220 --> 33:38.930
Hello.

33:40.980 --> 33:42.980
Leave us alone!

33:57.340 --> 33:59.340
Emma. Steve.

34:01.180 --> 34:08.010
Externals are fine: stability of
employment, income, residence.

34:08.060 --> 34:12.690
The police checks were OK... almost.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.860
You have a criminal conviction, Steve.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.610
Well, a suspended sentence.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.650
I got done for trespass once.

34:20.699 --> 34:23.010
I'm a photographer for... for the papers.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.780
Where were you trespassing?

34:25.780 --> 34:27.889
It's a long story, but it's how we met.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.370
Em was representing the other side.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.409
Tore me apart on the stand.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.420
I just thought she was lovely.

34:38.860 --> 34:43.969
Now, given your age, you won't
be adopting a baby, but a child?

34:44.020 --> 34:45.130
Yes.

34:45.179 --> 34:48.010
Some of these children come
from very troubled backgrounds.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.770
We don't want them to
experience further disruption.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.489
Oh, they wouldn't. Not with us.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.540
What about this sort of disruption?

34:56.820 --> 34:59.020
Imagine your child
having to deal with this.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.850
- At school, in the playground?
- Well, that would stop.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.250
- What, you'd give up being a lawyer?
- Well, no.

35:05.300 --> 35:09.260
But there are many types of
law. Don't all involve headlines.

35:12.620 --> 35:15.050
Do-gooders. Bring me out in a rash.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.930
What are you doing with me, then?

35:16.980 --> 35:18.970
Like I said, you're lovely.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.100
That headline's not gonna help us.

35:24.340 --> 35:29.410
The fella who wrote the article,
Tony Pullings. I know the name.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.540
Know him from years ago, when
he was just a photographer.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.610
Pretty good one.

35:35.660 --> 35:40.530
Used to work for the Cambridge Times. He was
working there when Linda Simms went missing.

35:40.580 --> 35:44.970
The local police used to use him to
photograph crime scenes and stuff.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.420
That's how he got the jump
on most of Fleet Street.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.970
So the case made him?

35:51.020 --> 35:53.020
Like it made Olivia Greenwood.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.120
Nothing like a dead white
schoolgirl to advance a few careers.

36:17.420 --> 36:19.100
Guard. Guard!

36:21.780 --> 36:24.530
- Aagh! - This is from
Phil and Charlie Simms.

36:24.580 --> 36:26.570
They say you've got a lawyer.

36:26.620 --> 36:29.730
They say you've been telling
lies about what you did to Linda.

36:29.780 --> 36:31.940
What did you do to her, Kevin?

36:33.420 --> 36:34.520
Tell us the truth now.

36:37.340 --> 36:38.100
Aagh!

36:39.260 --> 36:41.090
Tell us the truth.

36:41.140 --> 36:43.130
I killed her!

36:43.180 --> 36:47.060
That's it. Take care, Kevin.

36:54.580 --> 36:58.450
Kevin said it was an accident, but
it wasn't. It's hardly the first time.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.890
And there's something else.

36:59.940 --> 37:01.450
Kevin says he wants to stop.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.490
Working with you.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.930
He says he made it all up.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.010
He says he did it, he killed Linda.

37:07.060 --> 37:08.450
What, and you believe him?

37:08.500 --> 37:11.450
He stuck to the same story
for 14 years, Annie.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.530
The only reason he'd change
is cos someone's got to him.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.570
He says he wants you to stop.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.330
Because he's frightened.

37:18.380 --> 37:20.810
No, because he did it. He's a murderer.

37:20.860 --> 37:23.730
He ruined mum's life and my
life and he keeps ruining it.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.650
- All right, Jason.
- Derek's my dad, not him.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.490
He should never get out. Ever.

37:28.540 --> 37:30.540
I said that's enough.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.250
Are you gonna give up too, Annie?

37:33.300 --> 37:35.300
When you fought for so long?

37:36.380 --> 37:38.220
Just when I'm getting somewhere?

37:40.500 --> 37:42.170
Please tell me you've got something.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.530
Got a few tests to run but
basically done and dusted.

37:44.580 --> 37:46.290
You were right about the plant matter.

37:46.340 --> 37:49.730
None of the fragments in Linda's lungs
matches the flora of her burial site.

37:49.780 --> 37:51.330
What plant matter did she ingest?

37:51.380 --> 37:54.490
Conifers. Douglas fir and Sitka spruce.

37:54.540 --> 38:00.130
Soil samples: the soil, dust, sand, mainly
sand, found in Linda's lungs and throat

38:00.180 --> 38:03.170
also didn't match the
soils of the burial site.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.210
What do they match?

38:05.260 --> 38:07.650
They were impregnated with kerosene.

38:07.700 --> 38:12.210
High-grade kerosene, also containing
toluene, naphthalene and xylene.

38:12.260 --> 38:13.370
It's jet fuel.

38:13.420 --> 38:17.570
Most likely JP-8, the main
fuel of fighter jets, bombers.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.730
She was buried on an air force base.

38:19.780 --> 38:24.540
- She was first buried, buried alive...
- And then she was moved.

38:26.060 --> 38:27.370
Why?

38:27.420 --> 38:34.130
There are two bases in Suffolk the RAF and
the Americans use: Lakenheath and Crawbury.

38:34.180 --> 38:39.050
And Crawbury is less than a mile away from
where Linda was last seen, Hainwood School.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.090
But what does it mean?

38:41.140 --> 38:44.730
It means if Kevin murdered
Linda, he buried her twice.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.890
First near one of these airfields,

38:46.940 --> 38:48.690
then he dug her up and buried her again,

38:48.740 --> 38:50.450
20 yards away from where he works.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.570
It doesn't make sense.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.610
- Unless he didn't do it.
- It's enough.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.810
The Commission will
have to re-open the case.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.730
Aren't you all forgetting something?

38:57.780 --> 38:59.860
Kevin is now saying he did kill Linda.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.780
Doesn't that make this rather academic?

39:07.200 --> 39:11.990
I'm telling you I did it. I killed
her, I accept it. You're fired.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.600
I know you didn't do it.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.590
You have to say that.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.950
It's some kinda... kinda
lawyer thing, so you ca...

39:20.000 --> 39:23.550
Kevin, I know the review board
would re-examine your case,

39:23.600 --> 39:26.070
and I believe your
conviction will be overturned.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.110
I will get you moved, put in solitary.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.870
I will kick down the Home
Secretary's door if I have to.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.630
You shouldn't be in here and shouldn't
be getting beaten up when you're in here.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.590
I know you've been threatened,
that you're scared.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.870
But if you trust me, you
will walk out of this place.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.600
You'll be a free man.

39:45.280 --> 39:49.400
You fought for so long,
Kevin. Don't give up now.

39:52.400 --> 39:56.440
So... am I still your lawyer?

40:24.800 --> 40:27.520
[Oh, no.]

40:35.400 --> 40:37.400
All rise.

40:45.160 --> 40:48.350
In the appeal of Kevin Russell
against his conviction for murder,

40:48.400 --> 40:54.520
we have considered the appellant's arguments
and the new evidence referred to therein.

40:56.360 --> 41:02.070
In light of this, it is our majority opinion
that the conviction of Mr Russell is unsafe

41:02.120 --> 41:05.030
and we hereby order the
conviction be quashed.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.920
You did it.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.510
However, having considered
the Crown's response

41:12.560 --> 41:15.070
and the additional evidence
presented by the police,

41:15.120 --> 41:19.910
we agree with their submission that a full
retrial is necessary and is so ordered.

41:19.960 --> 41:24.120
In the meantime, we order that Mr Russell
be released on unconditional bail.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.600
All rise.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.480
Miss Banville. I'm Olivia Greenwood.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.160
I know who you are.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.510
So what's this new evidence?

41:47.560 --> 41:50.430
There was one lie of Kevin's
that I could never break.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.030
That he'd had no contact with Linda
Simms before the night she disappeared.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.190
- Why should that be a lie?
- Because it was.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.000
Look.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.990
Recognise her?

42:01.040 --> 42:03.710
Linda Simms. Recognise the place?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.870
Outside Kevin Russell's little hut.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.830
Where did you find this? Who took it?

42:07.880 --> 42:09.840
You'll learn soon enough.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.430
Ah, here comes the man himself.

42:13.480 --> 42:18.950
You let a terrorist's wife live in
your home and you set a murderer free.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.240
You play with fire.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.280
- Derek's outside with the car.
- Good luck out there, Kevin.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.160
We'll take you straight to the hotel.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.670
What's your reaction to the news

42:34.720 --> 42:37.350
there's going to be a retrial?

42:37.400 --> 42:38.990
Convicted killer Kevin Russell

42:39.040 --> 42:40.750
was released after the Court of Appeal

42:40.800 --> 42:42.230
overturned his conviction

42:42.280 --> 42:45.230
for the murder of schoolgirl
Linda Simms in 2003.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.070
However, in the light of new evidence,

42:47.120 --> 42:48.620
the police have announced...

43:08.760 --> 43:10.270
Heather? It's Alastair.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.030
- Are you on a secure line?
- Yes.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.590
You've seen what's been
happening over here.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.030
- Kevin Russell.
- Ah, on the table, behind the pie.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.910
What? What did you say?

43:19.960 --> 43:23.190
Don't worry about Russell. It's fixed.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.840
- How?
- I used the photographs.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.710
Are you out of your mind?

43:29.760 --> 43:33.110
The photos show what Russell is.
They'll put him back where he belongs.

43:33.160 --> 43:36.590
They could also expose other things.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.790
Yes, they could. I appreciate how
embarrassing that would be for you.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.150
Let's be clear here, not just for me.

43:42.200 --> 43:46.310
But happily it's irrelevant because
we own the man who took them.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.510
- You'd better be right about this.
- You seem rather stressed.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.550
Shall I come over and hold your hand?

43:51.600 --> 43:53.960
That's not necessary.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.680
Nonetheless, I'm coming.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.350
And you can do something for me.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.990
Russell's lawyer, I
want information on her.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.350
Why don't you Google her?

44:04.400 --> 44:06.270
I said information.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.950
Or have you been put so completely out
to grass no-one takes your calls any more,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.800
in which case why the fuck
should we bother to protect you?

44:47.920 --> 44:51.630
Kevin Russell, you are guilty!

44:55.160 --> 44:56.320
Kevin Russell...
