<i>??? "The Secret Life Of The
Amricen Teenager"...</i>

00:03.205 --> 00:05.907
- Wish me luck.
- You have a good first day in New York.

00:05.908 --> 00:09.177
Do you remember the other night when
we had that conversation about Adrian?

00:09.178 --> 00:11.546
It's still her decision
and none of our business.

00:11.547 --> 00:13.915
Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm
going to have the abortion.

00:13.916 --> 00:16.149
This wasn't an easy decision for me,

00:16.151 --> 00:18.085
but I've made the decision,
so leave me alone.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.889
I don't know what I want other
than for Amy never to find out.

00:21.890 --> 00:23.257
I think we should just tell your mom

00:23.258 --> 00:24.725
I'm living out here in
the guest house with you

00:24.726 --> 00:26.027
until I find somewhere else.

00:26.028 --> 00:27.195
That way, I can help you out.

00:27.196 --> 00:29.230
I would've supported her
decision either way.

00:30.432 --> 00:32.732
No, we can't. We can't, Ashley.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.001
We can if we want.

00:38.373 --> 00:39.574
Tom, I think we're high.

00:39.575 --> 00:41.242
I think these are marijuana brownies.

00:41.243 --> 00:42.410
Better not be.

00:42.411 --> 00:43.945
If Adrian's dad's not going

00:43.946 --> 00:45.546
and her mom's just sitting there by herself,

00:45.547 --> 00:46.547
shouldn't you go?

00:46.548 --> 00:49.116
All I could do is just be there.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.118
You and your mother are right.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.887
This is your decision.

00:52.888 --> 00:56.257
Feel free to change your mind.

00:56.258 --> 00:57.191
I had to say it.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.770
Ruben, it's me again.

01:09.771 --> 01:12.106
Look, I really think you should call Adrian.

01:12.107 --> 01:15.376
Let her know it's okay, Ruben.

01:15.377 --> 01:18.646
And this is the last time
I'm leaving a message.

01:27.222 --> 01:28.489
Ruben, listen to me.

01:36.198 --> 01:39.200
Hey, Janet.

01:39.201 --> 01:41.636
I hate to bother you,
but do you have that copy

01:41.637 --> 01:42.970
of the Wilson birth certificate?

01:42.971 --> 01:44.539
I need to finish this case up.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.674
I think we're gonna be able to
get them into court next week.

01:46.675 --> 01:47.942
I have it right here waiting for you.

01:47.943 --> 01:49.143
Oh, thank you.

01:49.144 --> 01:51.979
Not a problem. See you Tuesday. Okay.

01:53.949 --> 01:55.616
Hi.

01:55.617 --> 01:57.885
I'm Ricky's mom, Margaret. Aren't you...

01:58.987 --> 02:01.822
My mistake. I thought I might know you,

02:01.823 --> 02:04.759
but it's the wrong place
to be introducing myself.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.827
I apologize for intruding.

02:06.828 --> 02:07.995
I'm Adrian.

02:07.996 --> 02:10.731
I thought so. Nice meeting you.

02:12.734 --> 02:14.368
I'm having an abortion.

02:14.369 --> 02:16.671
You didn't have to tell me that.

02:16.672 --> 02:19.273
I'm here because I have business here.

02:19.274 --> 02:23.644
Ricky didn't mention
anything about anything.

02:23.645 --> 02:27.415
Oh, no, it's-- it's not Ricky's.

02:33.522 --> 02:34.889
It's not?

02:34.890 --> 02:36.190
No, it's not.

02:36.191 --> 02:38.159
Well,

02:38.160 --> 02:42.063
no matter who you're in this situation with,

02:42.064 --> 02:44.065
I'm sorry.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.133
I do counseling here sometimes,

02:46.134 --> 02:50.204
and I know this couldn't
have been an easy decision.

02:50.205 --> 02:52.540
Is there anything I can do for you?

02:52.541 --> 02:55.543
Is-- Is there
-- Is there anyone here with you?

02:55.544 --> 02:59.380
Uh, my mom just went outside to call my dad.

02:59.381 --> 03:02.216
He's-- He's not too happy about this.

03:02.217 --> 03:05.586
Well, it's not a happy thing.

03:05.587 --> 03:07.588
But you do what you wanna do,

03:07.589 --> 03:09.557
not what anyone else wants you to do.

03:09.558 --> 03:12.360
My mom's completely
supportive of my decision.

03:12.361 --> 03:15.596
Good. Good for her.

03:15.597 --> 03:18.466
Because it can really be
tough for a young woman

03:18.467 --> 03:22.069
to go through this without her mom.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.973
What about you? Are you
okay with your decision?

03:25.974 --> 03:27.642
Yeah.

03:27.643 --> 03:28.843
Mmm.

03:30.379 --> 03:32.713
I thought I was...

03:32.714 --> 03:35.082
until today.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.085
I just-- I don't know if it's right.

03:38.086 --> 03:40.821
For me, I mean.

03:40.822 --> 03:43.090
I thought it was the right thing to do.

03:43.091 --> 03:45.760
Now I don't know.
Maybe it's the wrong thing to do.

03:45.761 --> 03:48.262
Let's go back to "want."

03:49.765 --> 03:52.133
What do you want to do, Adrian?

03:52.134 --> 03:54.101
Because you can do what you want,

03:54.102 --> 03:56.504
and no matter what you wanna do,

03:56.505 --> 03:58.005
it's okay.

03:58.006 --> 04:01.142
I know what I don't wanna do.

04:01.143 --> 04:04.945
I don't wanna be a teenage mother.

04:04.946 --> 04:06.947
I-- I have goals.

04:06.948 --> 04:09.684
I have plans. I wanna go to law school.

04:09.685 --> 04:12.153
I wanna-- I wanna do something with my life.

04:12.154 --> 04:13.921
That's why I've always been so careful.

04:13.922 --> 04:15.423
From the beginning, I've been careful.

04:15.424 --> 04:17.024
This wasn't supposed to happen.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.125
Yes, but it did.

04:19.127 --> 04:22.129
And it does. It happens.

04:23.498 --> 04:25.966
You know, I did not know

04:25.967 --> 04:28.436
you wanna go to law school.

04:28.437 --> 04:31.706
My mother was an attorney. Family law.

04:31.707 --> 04:34.008
That's what I wanna do--

04:34.009 --> 04:35.976
practice family law.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.478
My dad's a D.A.

04:37.479 --> 04:39.180
I didn't know him growing up.

04:39.181 --> 04:40.681
I just got to know him.

04:40.682 --> 04:42.316
And he just married my mom.

04:42.317 --> 04:43.818
Yes, I know.

04:43.819 --> 04:45.820
We were hoping to be witnesses.

04:45.821 --> 04:49.056
Yeah, well, I kind of made a mistake,

04:49.057 --> 04:51.726
and Ricky didn't wanna be at the wedding.

04:51.727 --> 04:54.095
That mistake being Ben?

04:55.497 --> 04:58.599
I knew about that.
I just didn't know about this.

05:00.001 --> 05:02.737
It's gonna be okay, Adrian.

05:02.738 --> 05:06.807
Whatever you decide, it's gonna be okay.

05:08.310 --> 05:11.746
But it looks as if you haven't decided.

05:12.848 --> 05:14.348
I thought I had.

05:14.349 --> 05:16.650
"Thought."

05:16.651 --> 05:20.988
There are some decisions you can reverse

05:20.989 --> 05:23.991
and some you can't.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.926
This being one of those.

05:27.729 --> 05:29.230
Talk to me.

05:29.231 --> 05:33.634
Mrs. Ricky's Mother,

05:35.070 --> 05:38.339
I don't know what I wanna do.

05:38.340 --> 05:39.874
I don't know.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.509
Okay.

05:43.111 --> 05:46.380
I'm gonna go and find your mother,

05:46.381 --> 05:48.315
and then we'll all talk.

06:22.744 --> 06:24.979
Hey, the rule of the house is knock.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.114
What are you doing? That's for legs.

06:27.115 --> 06:29.316
No, it's okay. It's for anything with hair.

06:29.317 --> 06:32.119
- But you don't have hair.
- I do on my face.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.922
Well, then, get your own
razor and leg cream.

06:34.923 --> 06:36.657
No, I like this one.

06:36.658 --> 06:38.159
Don't worry. I'll get you another razor.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.094
A dozen of them.
And some more of that leg stuff.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.762
Okay, do that.

06:41.763 --> 06:44.098
Ah, smells like rain.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.766
So what are you doing up so early?

06:45.767 --> 06:47.134
Someone woke me up.

06:47.135 --> 06:48.636
Ricky and John? Yep.

06:48.637 --> 06:50.871
You two seem to be talking a lot lately.

06:50.872 --> 06:52.873
What's going on? Nothing.

06:52.874 --> 06:55.142
We were just talking about Adrian.

06:55.143 --> 06:57.011
Today's the big day.

06:59.281 --> 07:01.816
Today, huh? You're not going with her?

07:01.817 --> 07:03.818
Wait. No. Not a question.
You're not going with her.

07:03.819 --> 07:06.420
You've been a good friend to her, but this
is not something you can do with her.

07:06.421 --> 07:07.655
I realize that.

07:07.656 --> 07:08.856
All right, then.

07:25.407 --> 07:27.708
Golf?

07:27.709 --> 07:29.710
You're a golfer?

07:29.711 --> 07:32.379
I mean, I had no idea.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.882
I've always wanted to take up golf.

07:34.883 --> 07:37.151
That's great. It'd be great
if we had a hobby together.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.887
Well, we do have a hobby together.

07:39.888 --> 07:41.522
But golf would be nice, too.

07:41.523 --> 07:44.892
Yeah, sure. I'll get you
some clubs and some lessons.

07:44.893 --> 07:46.460
Well, couldn't you teach me?

07:46.461 --> 07:48.329
I'm really not that good.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.831
Well, then, we can be bad together.

07:50.832 --> 07:52.800
I'm gonna go put on my skort.

07:52.801 --> 07:54.535
Your what?

07:54.536 --> 07:57.004
You know, a skort.

07:57.005 --> 08:00.374
It's a cross between a
skirt and a pair of shorts.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.243
It's, like, the perfect golf attire,

08:02.244 --> 08:04.812
and I look really cute in it.

08:04.813 --> 08:06.180
Uh, Betty, I, uh...

08:06.181 --> 08:10.017
I kind of promised Ruben it
would just be the two of us.

08:10.018 --> 08:11.919
Well, maybe he can invite Cindy.

08:13.221 --> 08:14.688
Unless, of course,

08:14.689 --> 08:17.625
Cindy and Beand Adrian are together,

08:17.626 --> 08:20.628
and then Adrian's at that clinic,

08:20.629 --> 08:23.063
and then you and Ruben just wanna sit

08:23.064 --> 08:25.532
and hold hands and comfort each other

08:25.533 --> 08:27.835
while I'm left completely out of it.

08:27.836 --> 08:31.005
Something like that. I'll be back, okay?

08:31.006 --> 08:33.741
What, you're gonna just leave
me here all alone in the house?

08:33.741 --> 08:36.543
You said just the other day you never
have the house alone to yourself.

08:36.544 --> 08:38.544
I know, but I don't wanna
be alone today at the house.

08:38.546 --> 08:41.548
I'm sad. I wanted her to have that baby.

08:41.549 --> 08:43.884
I know, Betty, but it was her decision.

08:43.885 --> 08:45.619
And Ruben is really upset by this.

08:47.555 --> 08:49.757
I just need to hang out with him.

08:53.461 --> 08:55.396
Oh, all right. Go get your skort.

08:55.397 --> 08:57.865
I'll get the pro over there
to get you some lessons.

08:57.866 --> 09:00.801
All right. You're not gonna be sorry.

09:02.604 --> 09:05.105
I probably will be.

09:14.449 --> 09:17.051
Oh, my God. I'm too late, or I'm too early.

09:17.052 --> 09:18.519
Anyway, I'm here.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.121
And so is Ricky's mother.

09:21.122 --> 09:22.323
What's going on?

09:26.828 --> 09:29.063
Nothing, Ben. I didn't do it.

09:29.064 --> 09:31.899
You mean, you didn't do it yet?

09:31.900 --> 09:34.134
I'm not going to do it.

09:34.135 --> 09:37.071
Did Ricky's mother talk you out of it?

09:37.072 --> 09:39.073
No.

09:39.074 --> 09:40.741
Ricky's mom was just here

09:40.742 --> 09:43.210
signing paperwork on an
adoption or something,

09:43.211 --> 09:45.412
and we met.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.614
And, yeah, she talked to me.

09:47.615 --> 09:50.784
But she didn't try to talk me out of it

09:50.785 --> 09:54.088
or into it or anything.

09:54.089 --> 09:56.657
She just talked to me.

10:01.262 --> 10:04.431
I changed my mind. I couldn't do it.

10:06.134 --> 10:08.235
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

10:08.236 --> 10:11.505
You don't have to apologize to me, Adrian.

10:11.506 --> 10:13.474
I came here to tell you
that I'm here for you,

10:13.475 --> 10:15.075
no matter what.

10:15.076 --> 10:17.077
Whether you have the baby
or don't have the baby,

10:17.078 --> 10:19.013
I'm here for you.

10:19.014 --> 10:22.282
So, you changed your mind?

10:22.283 --> 10:23.817
You're having the baby?

10:25.220 --> 10:27.821
Yeah, Ben,

10:27.822 --> 10:30.724
I'm having the baby.

10:30.725 --> 10:32.993
Sweet. Oh.

10:32.994 --> 10:35.162
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:35.163 --> 10:37.097
I was looking for the right word.

10:37.098 --> 10:39.800
Obviously I didn't find it. There--

10:39.801 --> 10:41.535
There are a lot of words
in my head right now.

10:41.536 --> 10:44.271
I just can't quite get a
handle on the right one.

10:44.272 --> 10:46.206
It's okay.

10:46.207 --> 10:47.908
I don't know what to say either.

10:47.909 --> 10:49.309
I'm as surprised as you are.

10:49.310 --> 10:52.780
In-- In your surprise,
there's no chance of going

10:52.781 --> 10:56.083
to reverse your decision
and not have the baby?

10:56.084 --> 10:57.951
No.

10:57.952 --> 11:00.187
All right.

11:00.188 --> 11:04.224
Then...that's the way it's gonna be.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.462
We are having a baby.

11:09.731 --> 11:11.865
And you and I are gonna make the best of it.

11:15.303 --> 11:18.072
She decided,

11:18.073 --> 11:21.108
and I don't think it was because of Ruben.

11:21.109 --> 11:24.745
It's just what she feels in her own heart.

11:28.149 --> 11:30.984
Why don't you go home and talk to Ruben?

11:30.985 --> 11:34.154
'Cause I don't feel like
talking to him. That's why.

11:34.155 --> 11:37.858
Well, I'd invite you over,

11:37.859 --> 11:40.994
except Ricky's bringing John
by this afternoon, so...

11:40.995 --> 11:43.330
Yeah, but I-- I should go home.

11:43.331 --> 11:46.633
Do you have anyone you can talk to?
A close friend?

11:46.634 --> 11:49.703
Not really. Not yet anyway.

11:49.704 --> 11:52.072
But it's okay. I should just

11:52.073 --> 11:55.509
spend some time alone and let those
two spend some time together.

11:55.510 --> 11:58.011
She's gonna need you both--

11:58.012 --> 12:00.247
you and Ruben.

12:05.453 --> 12:08.155
All right. I guess I'll see you around.

12:08.156 --> 12:11.358
You have my card. You can always call me.

12:11.359 --> 12:13.026
And so can Adrian.

12:13.027 --> 12:14.962
Thank you.

12:16.164 --> 12:18.265
Thank God it wasn't Ricky.

12:20.902 --> 12:22.903
Say hello.

12:22.904 --> 12:24.404
Say hello to Mama.

12:24.405 --> 12:25.906
No. Is that Amy?

12:25.907 --> 12:28.208
Yes. No, she's looking for Ben.

12:28.209 --> 12:31.378
<i>Morning, John. It's me. It's Mama.</i>

12:31.379 --> 12:33.380
Why are we doing this? Where's Ben?

12:33.381 --> 12:35.382
I'm not sure.

12:35.383 --> 12:38.318
He might be with Adrian.

12:38.319 --> 12:40.921
Text message.

12:40.922 --> 12:42.389
Amy again?

12:42.390 --> 12:44.825
No, it's Adrian.

12:47.295 --> 12:49.062
I'm not asking if she's okay.

12:49.063 --> 12:50.931
I don't wanna know anything
about any of that stuff.

12:50.932 --> 12:54.668
Well, you might wanna know this.

12:54.669 --> 12:56.603
She's decided to have the baby.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.752
Because you weren't here when she called.

13:05.753 --> 13:07.253
You couldn't tell her to call me on my cell?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.821
Well, Amy has your cell number,

13:08.822 --> 13:11.424
and she has your office number at
the store and the store number.

13:11.425 --> 13:13.593
I'm sure she'll call you. She only called me

13:13.594 --> 13:15.194
because she couldn't get
ahold of Ashley and Ricky,

13:15.195 --> 13:16.629
and she wanted to find out how John is.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.131
John's fine. How's Amy?

13:18.132 --> 13:19.799
She misses John, but she's fine.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.468
Good. I wonder what she's eating.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.404
She's been to a coffee shop in her
neighborhood for almost every meal.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.641
I wish we had a coffee shop in our
neighborhood. I thought she had her own
kitchen.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.110
She does have her own kitchen,
but she's still settling in.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.045
She hasn't been to the grocery store yet.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.614
I don't think she's found
a grocery store yet.

13:34.615 --> 13:37.350
You know where the grocery store is, right?

13:37.351 --> 13:38.851
I hope that's a cooking magazine.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.486
It's not.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.989
I'm reading an article on w the
rain forest is disappearing.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.792
Maybe hungry husbands are eating the trees.

13:45.793 --> 13:47.960
You ever gonna cook again? I don't know.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.463
What happened to the family dinners?
I really thought that was a good idea.

13:50.464 --> 13:53.566
Well, I did, too, and then Amy went away,
and I thought, what's the point?

13:53.567 --> 13:55.768
Well, I'm home. Ashley's home. Ricky's home.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.403
Well, he's here in this home anyway.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.971
Well, it doesn't feel right without Amy.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.239
What doesn't feel right about it?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.942
Well, I'm not hungry, okay? I'm starving.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.944
You're eating. It's a sandwich.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.980
Do you remember you used to make me a
sandwich when I'd come home for lunch?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.016
Now I'm home for lunch,
and I'm eating my own bad sandwich.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.518
I need some real food. Well, it's Saturday.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.020
I don't like to go to
the market on Saturday.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.455
It's too crowded.
I'll go tomorrow or on Monday.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.456
Or the day after that.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.325
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.828
We're gonna go visit our
other grandma and grandpa.

14:21.829 --> 14:24.697
Okay. See you later. We'll eat dinner
over there, just to let you know.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.332
What are you having? Maybe I'll join you.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.334
I'm sure that would be fine,
if you wanna come.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.736
No, he doesn't. Oh, you can come, too.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.338
And Ashley. I'm sure it's fine.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.208
No, we wouldn't dream of intruding
on your dinner with your parents

14:35.209 --> 14:36.976
or on John's time with
his other grandparents.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.345
You go have a nice time.
We'll see you later.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.847
Oh, say hi to your mom for me, okay?

14:40.848 --> 14:42.481
So she cooks-- your mother?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.884
I'm gonna go check on Robie.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.721
Bye, John. Bye, Ricky.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.289
Bye to you, too.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.225
Hey, why don't you pick up
a pizza on the way home?

14:56.864 --> 14:58.564
What's up?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.533
What's up?

15:00.534 --> 15:03.536
Yeah. Nothing.

15:03.537 --> 15:06.339
Nothing with me anyway. See you.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.117
Who you looking for?
The father of your sister's baby?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.920
He left with the baby. You're in the clear.
No, I'm looking for Mom.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.955
She's checking on Robie.
Aren't you supposed to be shopping?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.724
Come on. I have to talk to you.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.826
Outside where we can see
if she comes back in.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.921
What's going on?

15:54.922 --> 15:57.323
I have to get back to work.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.261
You better sit down.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.898
Oh, no. Yeah, "oh, no."

16:07.834 --> 16:10.069
Oh, no, Ashley.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.771
Please,

16:11.772 --> 16:14.140
please no.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.641
I didn't do anything.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.777
Oh. Well, then, who did?

16:17.778 --> 16:19.278
Ben and Adrian.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.213
Oh, I knew about that.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.517
No, Mom, not that.

16:24.518 --> 16:26.819
Everyone knows that.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.121
Oh, no.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.257
Are they...

16:31.258 --> 16:32.658
Is Adrian...

16:32.659 --> 16:34.193
Yeah, she is.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.696
How long have you known this?

16:36.697 --> 16:38.764
Oh, please don't be angry with me.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.300
I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell Amy, either.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.169
I couldn't tell anyone.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.805
And I thought Adrian was having an abortion,

16:45.806 --> 16:47.840
so it was no one's business, just Adrian's.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.176
Is that why you stayed home
from school with her that day?

16:50.177 --> 16:53.179
Well, I just went over there to
get a ride, but she felt sick.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.047
She had morning sickness,
so I stayed home with her.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.916
And she told you that
she's getting an abortion?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.885
Oh, Ashley.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.655
That's too big of a secret
for you to have to keep.

17:02.656 --> 17:05.057
You could've talked to me.
You could've told me about that.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.526
No, I couldn't, Mom. I really couldn't.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.097
And Adrian was waiting for her mom
to come home so she could tell her,

17:11.098 --> 17:12.964
and then she could go with her.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.935
And so, there was really
no reason to tell you

17:15.935 --> 17:17.569
or anyone else, so I didn't.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.638
So that's why you encouraged Amy to go away,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.575
'cause you were just hoping
that this would go away.

17:22.576 --> 17:24.743
Well, I think we all thought
that going to New York

17:24.744 --> 17:26.512
would be a good thing for Amy, didn't we?

17:26.512 --> 17:29.248
So, Ashley, it's not Ricky's baby, right?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.250
It's Ben's. Yep.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.853
And she's sure about that-- Adrian? Yep.

17:33.854 --> 17:35.721
And she's definitely getting the abortion?

17:35.722 --> 17:38.424
No. She changed her mind.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.626
Wow.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.396
So she's having a baby. Yep.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.731
And Amy doesn't know anything about this?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.767
Nope. Are you gonna tell Amy?

17:47.768 --> 17:50.136
No, I'm not. I think Ben should tell her.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.073
Why? Are you gonna tell Amy?

17:54.074 --> 17:56.809
Oh, Mom, you can't be the one to tell her.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.711
You just can't.

17:58.712 --> 18:00.312
It has to be Ben.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.581
He has to do it, or else
Amy will never forgive him.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.451
Well, Ashley, I'm not so sure that
she's ever gonna forgive him anyway.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.587
Well, if you tell her,
I may never forgive you.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.589
And you know what? Neither will Amy.

18:26.034 --> 18:27.301
Are you okay?

18:28.604 --> 18:31.072
Your dad called us,
saying he was so worried about you.

18:31.073 --> 18:33.341
But I told him I was
praying for you. And I did.

18:33.342 --> 18:35.710
I prayed for you and for, you know...

18:35.711 --> 18:38.512
And no matter what happens, Adrian,
you're my friend, and I love you.

18:38.513 --> 18:40.681
And God loves you. He does. And God is love.

18:40.682 --> 18:42.483
And we all just need to love each other.

18:43.585 --> 18:45.553
You went with her?

18:45.554 --> 18:48.689
Well, I-- I got there a little late.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.625
Grace, let go of me.

18:50.626 --> 18:51.993
We wanna tell you something.

18:53.462 --> 18:55.930
Go ahead. Tell me.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.501
I'm having the baby.

19:02.437 --> 19:05.439
What? You're having the baby?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.441
Oh, my gosh! This is amazing news!

19:07.442 --> 19:08.910
I'm gonna be an aunt!

19:08.911 --> 19:11.279
You're not gonna be an aunt.
You're not my sister, but--

19:11.280 --> 19:13.381
But I'm like a sister. Yes, you are.

19:13.382 --> 19:15.917
I--

19:15.918 --> 19:18.619
I mean, to Adrian.
You're like a sister to Adrian.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.322
He's in a state of shock. So am I.

19:21.323 --> 19:22.556
We don't know what we're saying,

19:22.557 --> 19:24.158
but we just wanted to let you know.

19:24.159 --> 19:27.128
Well, I'm so happy that you let me know.

19:27.129 --> 19:28.362
You a-and Ben.

19:35.470 --> 19:38.539
So, you're having a baby.

19:44.479 --> 19:47.281
Get up. Get up.

19:47.282 --> 19:49.450
Adrian and Ben are in the kitchen.

19:49.451 --> 19:51.519
Tom, I can't get up. My back is killing me

19:51.520 --> 19:53.788
from falling asleep in
the shower last night.

19:53.789 --> 19:55.790
I think it's out of place or something.

19:55.791 --> 19:57.158
I got this shooting pain.

19:57.159 --> 19:59.160
She is having a baby.

19:59.161 --> 20:01.128
Adrian's having the baby.

20:01.129 --> 20:03.531
I don't think so, Tom. No, she is.

20:03.532 --> 20:05.232
I think she's not having the baby.

20:05.233 --> 20:08.436
I think she's already taken care of that.
Not having the baby.

20:08.437 --> 20:10.504
Listen to me.

20:10.505 --> 20:13.708
Adrian's having the baby.

20:19.715 --> 20:21.916
All right. Is there any reason to believe

20:21.917 --> 20:25.553
that we might still be...
high off those brownies?

20:25.554 --> 20:26.554
No.

20:28.056 --> 20:30.157
Shoot. I forgot to call Madison back.

20:30.158 --> 20:32.560
Short-term memory loss.

20:32.561 --> 20:35.563
Don't be angry with me.

20:35.564 --> 20:37.698
Well, if you're Shor
t-term memorliving with Tom,

20:37.699 --> 20:40.401
which you're not, by the way,
'cause I don't want you to,

20:40.402 --> 20:43.371
<i>/C well, then, why is your truck parked
blocks away from the Bowman house?</i>

20:43.372 --> 20:45.373
I'm parked behind your truck again.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.841
It's still here.

20:46.842 --> 20:49.343
I'm gonna walk over there and
talk to you face to face.

20:49.344 --> 20:52.146
All right? Just stay there and give me,
like, five minutes, okay?

20:52.147 --> 20:54.415
All right. I'm giving you five minutes.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.350
But if you're not here in five minutes,

20:56.351 --> 20:58.319
I'm out of your life, Jack Pappas.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.455
I'll be there. I'll be back.

21:06.795 --> 21:09.697
Adrian's having a baby.

21:09.698 --> 21:13.100
Praise the Lord!

21:20.876 --> 21:23.044
I bet it's gonna be a beautiful baby.

21:25.347 --> 21:27.548
Did I just see Jack go by?

21:27.549 --> 21:29.550
Are you seeing Jack again? Are you?

21:29.551 --> 21:31.085
No. No.

21:31.086 --> 21:33.521
I'm not seeing Jack.
I'm definitely not seeing Jack.

21:33.522 --> 21:35.823
Okay, well, am I seeing Jack?

21:35.824 --> 21:37.491
I thought I saw Jack.

21:37.492 --> 21:39.226
He's kind of living in our guest house.

21:39.227 --> 21:41.562
Do you think he saw us? Yeah,
I think he saw us.

21:41.563 --> 21:44.198
I saw him. And he was running.

21:44.199 --> 21:45.833
Why is he running? Why is Jack running?

21:45.834 --> 21:47.968
Because nobody knows he's
living in the guest house.

21:47.969 --> 21:50.171
So you two can't say anything to anyone.

21:50.172 --> 21:53.040
Especially my mom and Jeff,
because they're taking the day

21:53.041 --> 21:54.975
to be with each other.

21:57.245 --> 22:00.281
Uh, I better go.
Adrian, I can come back for you.

22:00.282 --> 22:03.117
But I think I better find Jack
before he can say anything to anyone

22:03.118 --> 22:05.586
who might say something to Amy
before I say something to Amy.

22:05.587 --> 22:07.455
Okay.

22:12.394 --> 22:14.161
He should say something to Amy.

22:14.162 --> 22:16.030
You two can't keep this a secret from Amy.

22:16.031 --> 22:17.865
I don't intend to.

22:17.866 --> 22:19.867
I'm not trying to keep it a secret at all.

22:19.868 --> 22:22.736
I texted Ashley. I told her.

22:22.737 --> 22:25.706
Not that she'll tell Amy, but,
hey, if she does, she does.

22:25.707 --> 22:27.208
Well, she may not tell Amy,

22:27.209 --> 22:30.444
but she will probably tell Ricky.

22:30.445 --> 22:33.214
Adrian. What?

22:33.215 --> 22:35.783
I'd tell him myself,
but we're not speaking to each other.

22:35.784 --> 22:38.385
Ricky will tell Amy.
He probably tells her everything.

22:38.386 --> 22:40.921
Yeah, well, I can't worry about that.

22:40.922 --> 22:43.057
I'm gonna have plenty of
other things to worry about.

22:43.058 --> 22:45.392
Ricky and Amy are not my first concern.

22:45.393 --> 22:46.760
The baby is.

22:46.761 --> 22:49.763
Well, that's good.

22:49.764 --> 22:52.633
So, how are you? Are you okay?

22:52.634 --> 22:54.368
Yeah.

22:54.369 --> 22:56.337
I'm okay, I guess.

22:58.573 --> 23:00.074
It's all pretty new--

23:00.075 --> 23:03.310
the idea of actually having the baby.

23:03.311 --> 23:05.312
Are you and, um--

23:05.313 --> 23:07.915
Are you and Ben thinking
about getting married?

23:07.916 --> 23:11.118
Oh, yes, we are, Grace. Ben and I plant
to get married as soon as possible.

23:11.119 --> 23:13.621
Really? No, I just said that

23:13.622 --> 23:16.524
so I could see if you're
still interested in him.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.526
Oh, you're still interested in him

23:18.527 --> 23:21.662
even though I'm having his baby,
and he's in love with Amy?

23:21.663 --> 23:23.664
How long are those two gonna be in love

23:23.665 --> 23:25.399
when she finds out you're having his baby?

23:27.169 --> 23:28.936
So you're not just living with Tom,

23:28.937 --> 23:30.671
you're eating pot brownies with him?

23:30.672 --> 23:34.375
Were you stoned before or after
you parked your truck blocks away?

23:34.376 --> 23:36.110
Um, after?

23:36.111 --> 23:38.112
It was after.

23:38.113 --> 23:40.181
Mrs. Bowman, or Mrs. Zegay,

23:40.182 --> 23:42.316
or whatever she's calling herself,

23:42.317 --> 23:44.852
she doesn't know I'm living
in the guest house yet.

23:44.853 --> 23:47.721
Well, I don't kvow why you
just couldn't tell me.

23:47.722 --> 23:49.757
You know, I'm not jealous of Grace.

23:49.758 --> 23:52.226
I don't care if you live in
her guest house. So what?

23:52.227 --> 23:55.062
Really? No, not really.

23:55.063 --> 23:57.531
I don't want you hanging
out with Tom as an excuse

23:57.532 --> 23:59.967
to hang out with Grace.

23:59.968 --> 24:02.336
And besides, if Mrs. Bowman said--

24:02.337 --> 24:05.573
or Mrs. Zegay, or whatever
she's calling herself now,

24:05.574 --> 24:07.508
said that you can't live in the guest house,

24:07.509 --> 24:09.877
then the answer is no,
you can't live in the guest house.

24:09.878 --> 24:12.179
She'll let me live in the guest house.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.948
Tom needs me.

24:13.949 --> 24:16.450
Hanging out with Tom--

24:16.451 --> 24:19.920
it's good for Tom, and it's good for me.

24:19.921 --> 24:22.890
Well, it's not good for me, or us.

24:22.891 --> 24:25.793
What am I saying?
It's not good for you or Tom.

24:25.794 --> 24:27.661
You guys got stoned on pot brownies.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.301
Hi. Hi there.

24:34.302 --> 24:36.303
I was wondering if I might
have a word with Jack.

24:36.304 --> 24:38.872
No, you can't have a word with Jack.
I'm having a word with Jack.

24:38.873 --> 24:40.874
I'm kind of talking to Madison here.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.443
But I heard. And don't worry.

24:42.444 --> 24:44.945
I'm not gonna say anything. Heard what?

24:44.946 --> 24:47.514
What'd you hear?

24:49.451 --> 24:51.452
Well, whatever it is,
you guys have to tell me.

24:51.453 --> 24:53.220
I'm Amy's best friend.

24:53.221 --> 24:55.956
Which is exactly why I didn't
wanna say anything, Jack.

24:55.957 --> 24:58.926
I'm sorry. I have some news
of my own I'm trying to break.

24:58.927 --> 25:01.929
Yeah, about the guest house?
That news has already been broken,

25:01.930 --> 25:03.597
and you're gonna have to fix it.

25:03.598 --> 25:05.966
What's your news, Ben?

25:05.967 --> 25:08.669
Well, I didn't tell Amy

25:08.670 --> 25:13.140
about Adrian having an abortion,
or having had an abortion.

25:13.141 --> 25:14.808
She had the abortion, right?

25:16.878 --> 25:18.846
Just say it.

25:20.248 --> 25:22.783
Say what?

25:22.784 --> 25:25.319
Adrian decided to have the baby.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.955
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:27.956 --> 25:29.757
Oh, my God.

25:29.758 --> 25:32.159
You better call her right now.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.295
Call before somebody else tells her,
before I tell her.

25:34.296 --> 25:36.997
I'm going to tell her.
I just-- I don't know when yet.

25:36.998 --> 25:40.034
I'll tell you when.
Before anybody else tells her.

25:52.747 --> 25:56.717
Well, he's asleep, finally.

25:56.718 --> 25:59.720
I thought a couple hours at
the playground would do it.

25:59.721 --> 26:01.689
I should've taken him to my apartment.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.691
He knows my apartment.
He doesn't know your house.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.693
Well, he'll get to know this house.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.362
And this is your house, too.

26:08.363 --> 26:11.498
I'm really happy to see you.
How are you? How have you been?

26:11.499 --> 26:13.701
Fine. I hear things.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.202
Oh, no.

26:15.203 --> 26:17.137
You know I hear things.

26:17.138 --> 26:19.139
In my line of work,
I'm always hearing things,

26:19.140 --> 26:21.508
even things I don't wanna know about.

26:21.509 --> 26:23.010
Did you hear I'm fine?

26:23.011 --> 26:24.645
How's Adrian?

26:24.646 --> 26:26.580
Adrian-- I don't know.

26:26.581 --> 26:28.582
I'm not talking to her.
I told you I'm not talking to her.

26:30.185 --> 26:33.053
Aw, how can you know that?

26:33.054 --> 26:34.388
Know what?

26:34.389 --> 26:36.323
That she's having Ben's baby.

26:36.324 --> 26:39.393
I ran into her at the clinic.

26:39.394 --> 26:41.829
You didn't talk her into
having the baby, did you?

26:41.830 --> 26:44.264
'Cause it's not like her
to go and have a baby

26:44.265 --> 26:46.367
she doesn't wanna have and that
Ben doesn't want her to have.

26:46.368 --> 26:48.736
I didn't talk Adrian into anything.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.905
Even if they have a baby,
even if Adrian ends up with Ben,

26:51.906 --> 26:54.408
even if they get married and
live happily ever after,

26:54.409 --> 26:56.610
I'm not gonna marry Amy, you got that?

26:56.611 --> 26:59.179
I am not going to marry Amy.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.914
I don't wanna get married.

27:00.915 --> 27:03.150
I didn't even wanna have a baby.

27:03.151 --> 27:05.219
You know, and just because I did have a baby

27:05.220 --> 27:07.254
doesn't mean I'm gonna be stuck with anyone,

27:07.255 --> 27:09.923
even Amy, for the rest of my life.

27:22.992 --> 27:25.027
Oh, excellent. I'll eat in here.
Thanks. All right.

27:25.028 --> 27:27.563
Look, I need you to do me a favor.
Take this into the kitchen.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.698
I wanna walk next door and see Ruben. Ruben?

27:29.699 --> 27:31.667
Yeah, we're friends, Ruben and me,
and I wanna talk to him.

27:31.668 --> 27:33.869
About Adrian?

27:33.870 --> 27:36.238
Don't you think you ought to wait?
No, I don't.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.674
I think I'd better find out right now
who they're telling what to and when.

27:38.675 --> 27:40.709
I don't want Amy to find out.
It would break her heart.

27:40.710 --> 27:44.246
She's alone and in New York City.
No, it's just not the right time.

27:44.247 --> 27:47.015
So I'm just gonna ask them if they can
keep quiet for a few weeks, like Amy did.

27:47.016 --> 27:49.385
Dad, I think too many people know already.

27:49.386 --> 27:51.320
What people? Well, Ben, for one.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.822
He's not gonna tell her.
At least not right away.

27:53.823 --> 27:56.358
And I'll go over and talk to Leo, too.
Well, Ricky knows.

27:56.359 --> 27:59.695
He's not gonna tell her, especially after I
talk to him and tell him not to tell her.

27:59.696 --> 28:02.131
Ricky will do what's best for Amy,
and it's best for Amy if she doesn't know.

28:02.132 --> 28:04.900
At least not until she gets home. Oh, I see.

28:04.901 --> 28:06.702
So all of the dads are gonna get together

28:06.703 --> 28:08.971
and fix things for the
womenfolk the way men do.

28:08.972 --> 28:10.372
Yeah, we are.

28:10.373 --> 28:12.307
Could you imagine being
all alone in a new place

28:12.308 --> 28:14.510
without your friends and family around
and finding out something like this?

28:14.511 --> 28:16.445
Dad, you can't fix this.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.180
Adrian is having a baby.

28:18.181 --> 28:21.316
And I don't want Amy to get her
heart broken again, either,

28:21.317 --> 28:23.886
but Ben's gonna have to tell her
before someone else tells her.

28:23.887 --> 28:25.854
And he can't wait weeks.

28:25.855 --> 28:27.890
He can't wait until she gets back here,

28:27.891 --> 28:29.391
after everyone else in the world knows.

28:29.392 --> 28:31.393
That would kill her. Look, sugarplum,

28:31.394 --> 28:33.862
this is too big a problem
for you to handle, okay?

28:33.863 --> 28:36.031
You just leave it up to me and
take the pizza to your mother.

28:36.032 --> 28:37.533
And tell her what?

28:37.534 --> 28:40.202
Tell her I'll be back in five minutes.

28:58.054 --> 28:59.087
Hi.

28:59.088 --> 29:00.088
Hi.

29:01.591 --> 29:03.091
Come in.

29:14.270 --> 29:16.238
Welcome to the neighborhood.

29:16.239 --> 29:18.407
It's been a year.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.008
But thanks.

29:21.478 --> 29:24.213
I, um-- I heard about Adrian--

29:24.214 --> 29:26.782
that she's with child.

29:27.884 --> 29:30.886
All right. You heard.

29:30.887 --> 29:33.589
So you know, so probably everybody knows.

29:33.590 --> 29:34.823
Not my Amy.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.360
Is Ruben here?

29:40.597 --> 29:42.464
I'm sorry.

29:42.465 --> 29:45.167
I'm really, really sorry.

29:46.903 --> 29:48.904
And then I learned

29:48.905 --> 29:52.207
the most important thing of
all is the follow-through.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.042
Right? So you--

29:54.043 --> 29:56.645
You always have to follow it through.

29:56.646 --> 29:58.680
You swing it back,

29:58.681 --> 30:02.417
and then you follow it all the way through.

30:02.418 --> 30:04.786
And then, hopefully, you hit the ball.

30:06.923 --> 30:09.057
I gotta get some rest.

30:09.058 --> 30:12.594
I haven't been outdoors for
this long in a really long time.

30:12.595 --> 30:13.829
Good night. Good night.

30:18.768 --> 30:21.403
It's good to get out for a bit,

30:21.404 --> 30:23.405
enjoy the game.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.641
We have to do it again sometime. Yeah.

30:30.813 --> 30:32.314
Ruben,

30:32.315 --> 30:34.650
you're either gonna have to go home

30:34.651 --> 30:37.252
or call Cindy and let
her know where you are.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.187
I imagine she's starting to worry.

30:39.188 --> 30:41.857
And I don't wanna be the
one to get you in trouble.

30:41.858 --> 30:44.293
Or I could just call her.

30:44.294 --> 30:46.295
You could call her,

30:46.296 --> 30:48.463
but sooner or later,
you're gonna have to go home.

30:48.464 --> 30:50.432
I don't wanna be a bad host,

30:50.433 --> 30:52.434
but you're gonna have to go home, you know?

30:52.435 --> 30:55.437
The driver will take you.
You can pick up your car tomorrow.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.439
No, no. I'm fine, really.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.007
Just to be safe.

30:59.008 --> 31:01.109
Well, maybe I don't wanna be home.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.245
I might rather go to a hotel or something.

31:03.246 --> 31:06.181
You can't do that. And you can't stay here,

31:06.182 --> 31:08.350
'cause then I'll get in
trouble with your family.

31:08.351 --> 31:10.686
Come on. Your girls need you.

31:10.687 --> 31:12.988
So you're gonna have to
put your feelings aside

31:12.989 --> 31:15.824
and be there for them,
even though you didn't agree

31:15.825 --> 31:18.760
with what Adrian felt she had to do.

31:18.761 --> 31:20.662
Hi.

31:20.663 --> 31:23.131
Hi. Hi.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.968
I was wondering when you'd get home.

31:25.969 --> 31:28.604
We were worried about you two. How are you?

31:28.605 --> 31:29.838
I'm fine.

31:29.839 --> 31:31.673
I was talking to Adrian.

31:31.674 --> 31:34.643
Oh, I'm-- I'm fine.

31:34.644 --> 31:35.978
Hi, Dad.

31:35.979 --> 31:38.080
Hi, Adrian.

31:38.081 --> 31:40.582
Hi.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.584
I don't know what to say, Adrian,

31:42.585 --> 31:45.687
but do you have to look so happy?

31:45.688 --> 31:49.391
It may be relief you're feeling,
but it's coming off asasas happiness,

31:49.392 --> 31:51.560
and I don't get that.

31:51.561 --> 31:55.163
Dad, didn't you talk to Mom?

31:55.164 --> 31:57.199
I changed my mind.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.534
You changed your mind about...

31:59.535 --> 32:00.535
About...

32:00.536 --> 32:01.937
You two don't know?

32:01.938 --> 32:03.338
Dad, I tried to call you.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.207
When did you try to call me?

32:05.208 --> 32:06.375
Pretty much all day.

32:06.376 --> 32:08.010
Well, you didn't try very hard.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.378
Well, I called you.

32:09.379 --> 32:11.380
Yeah, once, and you didn't
even leave a message.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.348
I didn't wanna leave this on a message,

32:13.349 --> 32:16.251
and I figured that Cindy told
Ruben and Ruben told you and--

32:16.252 --> 32:18.553
I'm having the baby.

32:18.554 --> 32:21.490
We're having the baby.

32:21.491 --> 32:23.492
Although, we don't really know what

32:23.493 --> 32:26.361
"we" and "we're having the baby"
means yet, but, uh...

32:26.362 --> 32:27.429
You are?

32:27.430 --> 32:28.530
I am.

32:28.531 --> 32:30.032
And your mother knows?

32:30.033 --> 32:31.867
Of course she knows.

32:31.868 --> 32:34.069
I'm surprised you don't know.

32:34.070 --> 32:37.339
I'm surprised you're even here.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.908
I just wanted to say thank
you to Mr. Boykewich

32:39.909 --> 32:41.877
for telling Ben to come
to the clinic with me.

32:41.878 --> 32:45.580
So, thank you, Mr. Boykewich.

32:45.581 --> 32:47.582
I'm really happy Ben was there with me.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.851
I mean, he got there a little late,

32:49.852 --> 32:52.020
after I had made the decision.

32:52.021 --> 32:54.623
But it was my decision to make anyway,

32:54.624 --> 32:57.926
so it was nice to have him there afterwards.

32:57.927 --> 33:00.595
And all day.

33:00.596 --> 33:02.531
We've had a nice day.

33:05.201 --> 33:07.636
I thought you and Mom might need some time,

33:07.637 --> 33:09.638
so I wasn't in a hurry
to get back to the house.

33:09.639 --> 33:10.906
We've been over at Grace's.

33:15.845 --> 33:18.146
I love you, Adrian,

33:19.449 --> 33:22.818
and I know this was not easy.

33:22.819 --> 33:25.620
And it's not going to be easy.

33:25.621 --> 33:28.290
But it's the right thing to do.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.559
For me, okay?

33:30.560 --> 33:32.494
For me, Dad.

33:32.495 --> 33:34.596
Come on. Let's go home.
We'll talk in the car.

33:35.832 --> 33:38.166
Good night. Good night.

33:38.167 --> 33:40.068
Let her drive.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.875
So, she changed her mind.

33:46.876 --> 33:49.878
Yep. She changed her mind.

33:49.879 --> 33:52.013
So, you're gonna be a father.

33:52.014 --> 33:53.782
I'm going to be a father.

33:53.783 --> 33:55.183
Did you tell Amy?

33:55.184 --> 33:57.018
I'm going to tell Amy.

33:57.019 --> 33:59.087
You're damn right you're gonna tell Amy.

34:03.633 --> 34:06.201
Tom, we're off to I'm going
to ta bad start here.

34:06.236 --> 34:07.536
We're living a lie.

34:07.570 --> 34:09.538
Well, that's how it is.

34:09.572 --> 34:11.005
No, that's not how it is.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.741
That's how it is.

34:12.775 --> 34:14.976
Well, that's not how I want it to be.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.712
I'm an honest guy,

34:16.746 --> 34:19.514
and I'm gonna break the news to your mom
and Jeff and just hope for the best.

34:19.549 --> 34:22.885
One, they're still not at home.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.353
Well, as soon as they get home.

34:24.387 --> 34:27.289
And two, you're not that honest.

34:27.322 --> 34:29.391
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

34:29.425 --> 34:30.993
So I'm just gonna sit here

34:31.027 --> 34:33.161
and think about what I've done
for a little while longer.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.563
Or until Madison leaves?

34:35.598 --> 34:36.965
Yeah.

34:39.969 --> 34:42.471
So, I think there should be some rules.

34:42.505 --> 34:44.339
Well, there don't have to be rules,

34:44.373 --> 34:47.309
but if you wanna lay down some rules
for Jack, I completely understand.

34:47.342 --> 34:50.145
Children love boundaries.
Rules for you and Jack.

34:50.179 --> 34:52.347
Well, I'm not living with Jack.
Jack's living with Tom.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.149
No one's living anywhere
unless there's some rules.

34:54.183 --> 34:57.119
All right. Well, what are the rules?

34:57.153 --> 34:58.687
Jeez. No drugs.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.389
Mmm. I think my mom's

35:00.423 --> 35:02.424
got that one covered after
the whole brownie thing.

35:02.458 --> 35:04.626
I don't know what Christians
were doing with pot brownies

35:04.661 --> 35:06.929
in their refrigerator in the
first place, but, anyway...

35:06.963 --> 35:10.832
But anyway, my dad used to let this
homeless guy stay here, and he left them in
there.

35:10.867 --> 35:14.236
And nobody wanted to toss them out just in
case Mr. Anonymous Pot-loving Homeless Guy

35:14.270 --> 35:16.605
decided to come back? No one knew.

35:16.639 --> 35:18.607
Well, I sure hope your
mom keeps a better eye

35:18.641 --> 35:20.809
on what's going on in the
guest house from now on.

35:20.843 --> 35:22.177
I think there should be another rule.

35:22.211 --> 35:23.612
No sex in the guest house.

35:23.646 --> 35:26.882
Are you referring to me or you? You.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.685
Oh. But you and Jack are allowed
to have sex in the guest house?

35:29.719 --> 35:32.154
I think my mom might have
some rules about you and Jack

35:32.188 --> 35:34.122
not having sex in the guest house, Madison.

35:34.157 --> 35:36.124
Well, she can't have any rules

35:36.159 --> 35:38.093
about us not having sex
at my house, can she?

35:40.330 --> 35:41.730
Amy?

35:41.764 --> 35:43.065
Yeah, Amy.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.267
I don't think you should tell her.

35:45.301 --> 35:47.102
I think you should let Ben tell her.

35:47.136 --> 35:49.004
And you know how it goes.
Kill the messenger.

35:49.038 --> 35:50.405
Oh, I see.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.908
So if Amy decides to kill the messenger,

35:52.942 --> 35:56.278
it should be Ben, thus destroying their
relationship and leaving him to you.

35:56.312 --> 35:57.913
Or-- Well, to you and Adrian.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.515
Not that Adrian wants Ben.
But, you know, that could change.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.017
No, it won't change.

36:02.051 --> 36:04.486
And I didn't say that.
I didn't say any of that.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.689
You kind of did,
but I'm not gonna tell Amy, so...

36:07.724 --> 36:09.257
Let's make that a rule.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.893
That no one tell Amy but Ben? Mm-hmm.

36:11.928 --> 36:14.496
Isn't it kind of difficult to
make rules and dictate morals?

36:14.530 --> 36:17.366
No, not really. We've been
doing it for centuries.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.769
"We"? Christians, people of other religions.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.705
Well, this is America,
so I don't think we can really do that.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.307
We can try.

36:25.341 --> 36:27.242
Mmm.

36:27.276 --> 36:30.946
Don't be ridiculous.
We were just talking. And eating.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.280
Yeah. My food.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.116
That's been ready for two hours.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.385
I think George and I will
just excuse ourselves

36:36.419 --> 36:37.953
and let you two get this fight over with.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.121
Good night, George.

36:52.702 --> 36:53.869
All right.

36:53.903 --> 36:56.471
Just because you and
George were together before

36:56.506 --> 37:00.609
doesn't mean anything,
other than I'm slightly jealous.

37:00.643 --> 37:02.044
'Cause I love you.

37:02.078 --> 37:04.413
I love you, but I'm jealous.

37:04.447 --> 37:06.815
I hate being jealous.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.617
But I'm also really relieved.

37:08.651 --> 37:11.286
And I'm really happy
Adrian changed her mind.

37:12.488 --> 37:14.122
You're not?

37:16.192 --> 37:18.126
You're not.

37:19.295 --> 37:21.963
So it's my fault she changed her mind.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.100
I'm fine with that.

37:25.134 --> 37:27.302
Go ahead. Blame me.

37:27.336 --> 37:30.806
You're really okay with
Adrian being a mother at 17?

37:34.444 --> 37:36.878
I went over there to talk to Ruben.

37:36.913 --> 37:39.848
I want them to be considerate of the fact
that Adrian's pregnant by Amy's boyfriend

37:39.882 --> 37:43.018
and not to tell everyone until Amy's
home and we have a chance to tell her.

37:43.052 --> 37:46.021
George, we can't keep Amy
from finding out about this.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.390
Come Monday morning, the entire
school's gonna know about it.

37:48.424 --> 37:50.659
I am not gonna tell her.
Well, I'm not gonna tell her either.

37:50.693 --> 37:52.794
No? No.

37:52.829 --> 37:54.796
But I think Ben's gonna tell her.

37:54.831 --> 37:56.164
I hope he'll tell her.

37:56.199 --> 37:57.899
I don't want anyone to tell her.

37:57.934 --> 38:00.669
Not anytime soon anyway.
Not till she's home.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.746
Amy again?

38:10.780 --> 38:12.614
I hate to rush you out of here,

38:12.648 --> 38:15.851
but I have to go pick up my son.

38:18.054 --> 38:19.888
So what's her story?

38:19.922 --> 38:22.657
Is she really at some music school,
or is she pregnant again?

38:23.726 --> 38:25.494
People are ridiculous, you know that?

38:25.528 --> 38:28.130
Of course she's not
pregnant again. Of course.

38:28.164 --> 38:29.197
She isn't.

38:29.232 --> 38:31.032
All right. But Adrian is.

38:31.067 --> 38:32.501
You don't know that.

38:32.535 --> 38:35.237
I do know that. Jack parked his
truck in front of my house.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.238
Huh?

38:36.272 --> 38:38.039
Look, you should tell her

38:38.074 --> 38:40.308
before she finds out from someone else.

38:40.343 --> 38:42.043
It's not up to me to tell her.

38:42.078 --> 38:44.679
It's up to Ben, if there's
anything to tell her.

38:44.714 --> 38:46.882
I know my way out.

38:51.721 --> 38:53.555
It's just so hard to believe.

38:53.589 --> 38:55.757
It's not that hard to believe.
Not so hard to believe

38:55.792 --> 38:57.826
that Amy won't believe it when
she hears it from someone else.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.461
I said I'd tell her, and I'll tell her.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.263
Call her, Ben. Just call her.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.732
I dialed her number, and I got her message.

39:03.766 --> 39:05.667
She thinks she's having
problems with her phone

39:05.701 --> 39:07.569
because everyone keeps cutting her off.

39:07.603 --> 39:08.737
That's pretty funny.

39:08.771 --> 39:11.373
It's not funny. Did you leave her a message?

39:11.407 --> 39:13.975
I told her that I'm having
problems with my computer,

39:14.010 --> 39:17.245
so, you know, between her phone and
my computer, I could buy some time.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.248
And while you're buying time,
someone else could be talking to her.

39:20.283 --> 39:21.750
Not a good plan. I know.

39:23.052 --> 39:26.621
Amy will be okay, eventually.

39:26.656 --> 39:29.524
That's what I told Adrian-
that Amy will be okay.

39:29.559 --> 39:32.594
I mean, if anyone should understand,
it should be Amy, right?

39:32.628 --> 39:33.995
Are you kidding?

39:34.030 --> 39:35.730
No, he's not kidding, Hank.

39:35.765 --> 39:38.934
Oh. Yeah, of course not.
Not about something like that.

39:38.968 --> 39:40.969
Amy will understand. Tell her.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.971
Or don't. We don't really know.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.673
Maybe you should wait,
get your thoughts together.

39:44.707 --> 39:47.742
I mean, really, Ben, we love Amy.
We do. But we love you more.

39:47.777 --> 39:49.644
And today you just found out
you're becoming a father.

39:49.679 --> 39:52.514
So you can't tell the woman you
love that on the very same day.

39:52.548 --> 39:55.650
It's understandable. It is.
Just don't wait too long, okay?

39:55.685 --> 39:57.419
Maybe someone else should tell her.

39:57.453 --> 39:59.754
Someone like? Ashley?

39:59.789 --> 40:01.423
Ashley? Ashley?

40:01.457 --> 40:03.391
Ashley and Adrian have
been hanging out a lot,

40:03.426 --> 40:06.461
and I'm sure that Adrian told
Ashley so she'll tell Ricky.

40:06.495 --> 40:07.829
You haven't told Ricky?

40:07.864 --> 40:10.031
When? When was I gonna tell Ricky?

40:10.066 --> 40:12.834
I was with Adrian all day-
or practically all day.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.669
How is she doing?

40:14.704 --> 40:16.605
Okay, I think.

40:16.639 --> 40:17.839
And how are you doing?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.674
Not as well as Adrian,

40:19.709 --> 40:22.978
but probably better than
Amy when she finds out.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.850
<i> Morning, John.</i>

40:28.885 --> 40:30.819
It's Mama.

40:30.853 --> 40:32.654
Hi. How are you?

40:32.688 --> 40:34.289
I love you, baby.

40:35.358 --> 40:36.858
It's me. It's Mama.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.426
Mommy's in New York. Say, "Hi, Mama.

40:38.461 --> 40:40.762
Hi, Mommy."

40:40.796 --> 40:42.764
No, no. John, come back to the computer.

40:42.798 --> 40:45.233
Look at the-- No,
look at the computer, John.

40:45.268 --> 40:48.670
There you are. I can see you. No. No, no.

40:48.704 --> 40:50.005
John, don't go away.

40:50.039 --> 40:51.273
He's fine.

40:51.307 --> 40:53.141
<i>He can't be fine, Ashley.</i>

40:53.175 --> 40:56.044
<i>He's one. I'm his mother. I'm in New York.
Go get him.</i>

40:56.078 --> 40:57.545
Oh, Amy, stop.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.947
The kid doesn't know you're not here.

40:58.981 --> 41:00.749
<i>He just thinks you're at school</i>

41:00.783 --> 41:02.550
or living in the computer or something.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.386
He's fine.

41:05.721 --> 41:06.855
Bye.
