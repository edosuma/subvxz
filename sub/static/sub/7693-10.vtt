WEBVTT

00:08.509 --> 00:09.540
CHASE,

00:09.540 --> 00:11.642
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN BEAT ADAM ARM-WRESTLING.

00:11.642 --> 00:13.614
IT'D BE LIKE A CHICKEN
WRESTLING AN ALLIGATOR.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.247
ALL WE HEAR
IS A COCK-A-DOODLE-CRUNCH.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.019
HE'S RIGHT, BRO.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.422
YOUR SPAGHETTI ARMS
ARE NO MATCH
FOR THESE MEATBALLS.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.794
MWAH. MWAH. MWAH.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.696
MWAH. MWAH.
 HEY...

00:25.696 --> 00:28.459
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
KISSING YOUR GIRLFRIENDS,
LET'S DO HIS.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.533
BETTER BACK UP, LEO.
YOU'RE IN THE SPLATTER ZONE.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.667
OKAY, I WANT A CLEAN MATCH.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.570
NO WHINING, SCREAMING,
CRYING, OR TAP-OUTS.

00:40.671 --> 00:41.812
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, CHASE.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.276
THREE, TWO, ONE, GO!

00:45.276 --> 00:47.318
( slurps )
 UGH!

00:47.318 --> 00:50.751
HEY! NO FAIR!
HE LICKED HIS HAND!

00:50.751 --> 00:53.524
EXACTLY. CLEVER
BEATS STRONG ANY DAY.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.556
CHASE WINS.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.528
WAIT, WHICH HAND
DID YOU LICK?
 THAT ONE.

00:57.528 --> 00:58.689
MMM.

00:58.689 --> 01:01.362
CHASE WINS.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.134
HEY GUYS,
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:03.134 --> 01:05.065
OOH, BUNDLE UP, EVERYONE.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.169
IT JUST GOT PARTLY CREEPY
WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT
CHANCE OF ANNOYING.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.702
OOF. AM I GONNA
NEED MY UMBRELLA FOR THAT?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.676
SO, YOU GUYS WANNA HANG OUT
AT MY HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.848
WE JUST GOT A SICK
NEW FLAT SCREEN.

01:17.848 --> 01:21.552
IS IT AS SICK AS YOU MAKE ME?
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY SICK.

01:21.552 --> 01:23.654
WE'D LOVE TO HANG OUT TODAY.

01:23.654 --> 01:26.857
CHASE IS TOO POLITE TO SAY IT,
SO I'LL SAY IT FOR HIM.

01:26.857 --> 01:29.590
YOU'RE A LUNATIC,
AND WE'RE LEAVING.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.192
( groans )
 LEO!

01:31.192 --> 01:33.594
LEO, COME ON.
 LEO, I WAS NOT
GONNA SAY THAT AT ALL.

01:33.594 --> 01:38.098
YEAH, AND WE'RE WALKING.
GO. GO ON. GO. OUT.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.632
NICE TRY. SEE YOU LATER,
CAPTAIN EYEBROW.

01:43.334 --> 01:45.736
WHAT THE...?

01:45.736 --> 01:47.578
HOW DID YOU...?

01:47.578 --> 01:51.142
CHASE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN MOVE THINGS
WITH HIS MIND.

01:51.142 --> 01:54.415
HELP! SOMEBODY!
I'M TRAPPED!

01:54.415 --> 01:56.247
PRINCIPAL PERRY?!

01:56.247 --> 01:58.189
WHO AM I KIDDING?
SHE'S NOT HERE.

01:58.189 --> 02:00.421
IT'S FIVE-CENT-RIB NIGHT
AT THE BUFFALO BARN.

02:01.592 --> 02:04.495
LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, LEO.

02:05.596 --> 02:07.228
MAN, IT IS FUN
TO MESS WITH YOU

02:07.228 --> 02:09.128
WHEN YOU CAN'T
TELL ANYONE I'M BIONIC.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.532
YEAH, IT'S A REAL PARTY
OVER HERE, TOO.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.304
I SHOULD JUST TURN YOU IN.

02:13.304 --> 02:17.638
GO AHEAD. THEN I'LL
JUST EXPOSE ADAM, BREE,
AND CHASE AS BIONICS,

02:17.638 --> 02:20.140
AND THE GOVERNMENT
WILL SWOOP IN
AND TAKE THEM AWAY.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.872
NOT IF I TURN YOU IN FIRST.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.477
( yells )

02:31.582 --> 02:34.185
YOU ARE GONNA
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.527
OR NEXT TIME...

02:36.527 --> 02:38.389
I WON'T MISS.

02:46.297 --> 02:48.769
VOICE LOG,
MONDAY, 3:23 P.M.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.602
GATHERING EVIDENCE
ON SUBJECT MARCUS.

02:51.602 --> 02:55.646
AND I WILL NOT GIVE UP
UNTIL I PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL

02:55.646 --> 02:58.209
THAT--
 ( musical ringtone plays )

02:58.209 --> 02:59.810
HELLO?

02:59.810 --> 03:02.853
OH, HEY MOM.
YEAH--CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

03:02.853 --> 03:04.885
THANKS. ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.357
BYE.

03:06.357 --> 03:08.889
THAT MARCUS IS EVIL
AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN!

03:11.362 --> 03:14.225
Male Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.896
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

03:15.896 --> 03:17.268
FASTER,

03:17.268 --> 03:18.529
SMARTER.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.831
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:20.831 --> 03:23.304
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

03:23.304 --> 03:25.306
♪♪

04:02.313 --> 04:06.277
BEHOLD THE INVENTION
THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE TRAVEL:

04:06.277 --> 04:09.280
THE DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES

04:09.280 --> 04:10.451
TELEPORTER!

04:10.451 --> 04:13.354
DON'T YOU MEAN
THE "TELE-DAVENPORT-ER"?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.329
OH, COME ON.
I WANNA BE THE CLEVER ONE
AROUND HERE FOR ONCE.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.430
YEAH. AND I WANT A CONVERTIBLE
MADE OUT OF DIAMONDS.

04:20.430 --> 04:21.862
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, EITHER.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.496
( altering voice )
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

04:25.496 --> 04:28.799
PLEASE TELL US
ABOUT YOUR AMAZING INVENTION.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.501
( normal voice )
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

04:30.501 --> 04:34.405
MY TELEPORTER CAN TRANSPORT
AN OBJECT ANYWHERE.

04:34.405 --> 04:37.778
IT DECONSTRUCTS IT
MOLECULE BY MOLECULE HERE,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.611
AND THEN, VIA MY NETWORK
OF GPS SATELLITES,

04:40.611 --> 04:44.284
RECONSTRUCTS IT ANYWHERE
ON THE PLANET, INSTANTANEOUSLY.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.416
SO...WAIT...

04:45.416 --> 04:48.459
DOES THIS MEAN THAT WE
COULD GO SURFING IN HAWAII

04:48.459 --> 04:50.991
AFTER SCHOOL AND STILL BE HOME
IN TIME FOR DINNER?

04:50.991 --> 04:51.992
( stammers )

04:51.992 --> 04:53.524
TECHNICALLY, YES.

04:53.524 --> 04:55.596
UH, BUT I HAVEN'T TESTED IT
ON A HUMAN YET.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.429
SO THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE
THAT ONLY OUR FOREHEAD

04:58.429 --> 05:01.672
AND PARTS OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS
WOULD MAKE IT BACK IN TIME
FOR DINNER.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.076
ALL I'M HEARING
IS MORE MEATLOAF FOR DADDY.

05:08.539 --> 05:11.642
THAT'S WHY I WANNA TEST IT
ON AN INANIMATE OBJECT FIRST.

05:11.642 --> 05:12.783
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.849
WHOA, THIS THING COULD PUT ME
ANYWHERE ON EARTH

05:18.849 --> 05:20.421
IN A NANOSECOND.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.394
FASTER THAN YOU,
BREE! HA!

05:23.394 --> 05:26.957
WHATEVER. YOU'LL STILL
BE UGLY WHEN YOU GET THERE.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.799
Adam: OOH.

05:28.799 --> 05:32.332
UH, SUPER-SPEED, PARTY OF ONE.
YOUR TABLE IS DUMB.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.335
OH, COME ON!
THAT WAS CLEVER.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.767
( beeping )

05:36.767 --> 05:39.710
HEY. MEATBALLS.
YOU JUST TURNED IT ON.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.572
BACK OFF SO I CAN
SHUT IT DOWN.

05:41.572 --> 05:43.113
( grunts )
 STEP ASIDE. I GOT THIS.

05:43.113 --> 05:45.576
UH--YOU GOT NOTHING.
MOVE OVER.

05:45.576 --> 05:48.779
I THINK YOU
HAVE TO SPIN THIS THING.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.481
HEY, GUYS,
I'M GOING TO THE MARKET.

05:50.481 --> 05:52.352
ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.455
OOH! CEREAL!

05:55.686 --> 05:58.058
WELL, THAT WAS RUDE.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.461
WHAT? YOU JUST...?

06:00.461 --> 06:03.133
Y-YOU SPUN THAT THING
SO FAST, ADAM,

06:03.133 --> 06:06.366
THAT WE'VE GOT NO CLUE
WHERE TASHA GOT TELEPORTED TO.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.698
SHE HAS TO BE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.500
SHE COULDN'T
HAVE GONE FAR, RIGHT?
 OH, GUYS, CALM DOWN!

06:09.500 --> 06:11.572
WHERE COULD SHE HAVE GONE?
 THERE'S A SIMPLE SOLUTION
TO THIS.

06:12.603 --> 06:14.405
DOES ANYONE
KNOW WHAT IT IS?

06:15.476 --> 06:19.780
WH--IF WHAT I
THINK JUST HAPPENED,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.753
WE ARE GONNA
BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

06:23.854 --> 06:26.817
GUYS, I THINK WE
JUST VAPORIZED TASHA.

06:26.817 --> 06:30.461
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO SAY "GOOD-BYE."

06:30.461 --> 06:31.492
OH, WELL. WHOO-HOO!
 ( laughing )

06:31.492 --> 06:33.924
( dance music plays )

06:33.924 --> 06:35.596
WHOO!

06:35.596 --> 06:37.868
SHAKE YOUR BOOTY!

06:43.974 --> 06:47.578
YES, DAD.
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.884
YES, I TOOK OUT THE TRASH.

06:53.884 --> 06:58.449
YES, I SET THE DVR
TO RECORD FUNERAL MISHAPS.

07:01.792 --> 07:06.096
SUSPECT IS STILL ON THE PHONE
WITH A MAN CALLED...

07:06.096 --> 07:08.999
"DADDY."

07:08.999 --> 07:12.703
ALSO, NOTE TO SELF,
RECORD FUNERAL MISHAPS.

07:17.868 --> 07:20.140
( beeping )

07:24.144 --> 07:26.076
( high-pitched )
SUSPECT HAS A MORPHING WALL!

07:26.076 --> 07:27.878
I MEAN...
( clears throat )

07:27.878 --> 07:31.081
( deep voice )
SUSPECT HAS A MORPHING WALL.

07:42.192 --> 07:45.636
HOW COULD YOU DROOL-BUCKETS
HAVE LOST TASHA
IN THE TELEPORTER?

07:45.636 --> 07:49.239
US? YOU WERE THE ONE
GETTING GRABBY
WITH THE CONTROLS.

07:49.239 --> 07:51.201
( scoffs )
 AND ADAM WAS THE ONE
WHO SPUN THE GLOBE,

07:51.201 --> 07:53.904
SO WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE TASHA IS.
 ME?!

07:53.904 --> 07:56.106
OH, WAIT.
YEP, THAT WAS ME.
 ( chuckles )

07:57.878 --> 07:59.710
WE NEED TO TELL DAVENPORT.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.211
OH, OH, TELL HIM WHAT?

08:01.211 --> 08:04.615
"SORRY...WE MESSED
WITH YOUR MACHINE
AND LOST YOUR WIFE"?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.689
NO! LET ME GIVE HIM
THE GOOD NEWS.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.722
LEO IS GONNA FREAK.

08:11.722 --> 08:14.094
NOT IF HE DOESN'T
KNOW TASHA'S GONE.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.766
WE'LL GET CHASE A WIG
AND A SKIRT.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.227
THIS COULD WORK, PEOPLE.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.699
( whispering )
Stop it.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.901
HEY, GUYS.
 ( all yell )

08:20.901 --> 08:23.934
UH, HEY.
MR. DAVENPORT...

08:23.934 --> 08:25.936
QUICK QUESTION. UM...

08:25.936 --> 08:28.038
YOU'VE TESTED
THE TELEPORTER'S ABILITY

08:28.038 --> 08:30.741
TO RETURN SOMETHING, RIGHT?

08:30.741 --> 08:32.613
( laughs )
 NOT YET.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.615
BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO.
OKAY.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.986
I'M GONNA SET THE TELEPORTER

08:35.986 --> 08:38.518
FOR TEN FEET AWAY.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.188
MM-HMM.

08:39.188 --> 08:41.221
YEAH.
 ( chuckles )

08:41.221 --> 08:44.154
OKAY. GET READY,
'CAUSE THIS IS GONNA

08:44.154 --> 08:46.156
BE TELEPORT-IFIC!

08:48.198 --> 08:50.130
WHAT? THEY CAN'T
ALL BE WINNERS.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.532
HAVE YOU EVER
HAD A WINNER?

08:59.670 --> 09:00.671
( laughs )

09:00.671 --> 09:03.874
WOW! A SCIENTIFIC
BREAKTHROUGH!

09:03.874 --> 09:06.316
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN ANYTHING THIS AMAZING

09:06.316 --> 09:07.848
IN ALL YOUR LIFE?!

09:07.848 --> 09:09.119
NEAT.
 YEP.
 HOORAY.

09:09.119 --> 09:10.881
GET ON WITH IT.
 OH.

09:10.881 --> 09:14.224
ALL RIGHT. NOW...
WE BRING IT BACK.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.331
WHOOPSIE.
 ( laughs )

09:21.331 --> 09:23.233
I GUESS I HAVE A FEW BUGS
TO WORK OUT

09:23.233 --> 09:24.564
ON THE "RETURN" FUNCTION.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.796
BUT...YOU KNOW...

09:25.796 --> 09:27.267
LEAST I DIDN'T
THROW A HUMAN IN THERE.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.999
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN STUPID.
 ( laughs )

09:31.271 --> 09:34.004
THIS IS AWFUL.
 I KNOW.

09:34.004 --> 09:38.348
I LOVED THAT CHAIR.
I DID SOME OF MY
BEST SITTING IN IT.

09:38.348 --> 09:41.181
HOW ARE WE GONNA
BRING TASHA BACK HERE SAFELY?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.953
OOH! I HAVE AN IDEA.

09:42.953 --> 09:47.087
ADAM, THIS IS A COMPLEX
SITUATION.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.260
WE'LL CALL YOU IF WE NEED YOU
TO LIFT ANYTHING HEAVY.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.293
EVEN IF WE LOCATE TASHA,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.265
WE NEED TO BRING HER
BACK HERE SAFELY

09:55.265 --> 09:56.997
WITHOUT TURNING HER INTO..

09:58.098 --> 09:59.199
THAT.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.302
I SEE NO DOWNSIDE.

10:06.977 --> 10:11.281
DAD, IT IS GONNA
BE SO EPIC WHEN I CAPTURE
ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.315
FINE. WHEN WE CAPTURE THEM.

10:16.316 --> 10:20.050
JUST LIKE WHEN WE
 FORGOT MY BIRTHDAY.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.953
OH, I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU ANGRY?

10:22.953 --> 10:25.095
OR ARE WE ANGRY?

10:32.302 --> 10:34.234
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

10:38.268 --> 10:41.241
( beep )
 I'M IN SOME SORT OF WEIRD
UNDERGROUND LAIR

10:41.241 --> 10:43.143
BENEATH MARCUS'S HOUSE.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.815
IT'S INCREDIBLY GRIM

10:44.815 --> 10:46.877
AND SMELLS LIKE
SEWER WATER AND...

10:46.877 --> 10:48.679
SWEATY DUDES.

10:56.386 --> 10:58.889
WHAT THE...?

10:58.889 --> 11:00.260
AHA!

11:00.260 --> 11:03.163
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
THAT MARCUS KNOWS
ABOUT YOUR BIONICS

11:03.163 --> 11:04.865
AND WANTS TO CAPTURE YOU.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.666
( clicking )

11:11.671 --> 11:12.743
BAM. EVIL LAIR.

11:15.405 --> 11:17.778
BAM. MARCUS'S CAPSULE.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.209
BAM. MARCUS.

11:19.209 --> 11:20.781
MARCUS?!

11:30.320 --> 11:33.223
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE, LEO.

11:33.223 --> 11:35.766
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
WHERE'S THE EXIT?

11:35.766 --> 11:38.698
OH, NO. YOU ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.100
YOU'VE SEEN TOO MUCH.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.873
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE?

11:42.873 --> 11:45.235
YOU WON'T
BE AROUND TO FIND OUT.

11:45.235 --> 11:50.140
SAY HELLO TO OUR
REMOTE-CONTROLLED
HOME-SECURITY SYSTEM.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.882
( beeps )

11:58.248 --> 12:00.150
WELL THAT LOOKS EFFECTIVE.

12:01.391 --> 12:03.894
WHAT'S IT SCANNING FOR?
DUST BUNNIES?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.758
( beeps )

12:26.176 --> 12:29.319
HOW BIG ARE YOUR
DUST BUNNIES?!

12:33.323 --> 12:35.025
THIS IS USELESS.

12:35.025 --> 12:38.188
WE NEED TO TELL MR. DAVENPORT
THAT TASHA IS GONE.

12:38.188 --> 12:39.459
NO! I CAN FIX THIS.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.092
I JUST UPLOADED
A SOFTWARE UPDATE.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.895
HEY...

12:44.895 --> 12:47.197
NOBODY TOLD ME
WE WERE RACING FRUIT.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.199
I'M GETTING MY KIWIS.
GET READY, BOYS.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.470
IT'S SHOWTIME.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.144
STOP. WE'RE NOT
RACING FRUIT.

12:54.144 --> 12:56.246
NO ONE RACES FRUIT!

12:57.948 --> 12:59.910
WE'RE TESTING
MY TELEPORTER FIX,

12:59.910 --> 13:02.282
WHICH IS NOW GOOD TO GO.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.415
WELL, IF IT'S "GOOD TO GO,"
WHY NOT JUST TEST IT ON TASHA?

13:05.415 --> 13:09.189
BECAUSE...IN THE HIGHLY
UNLIKELY EVENT
THAT IT DOESN'T WORK,

13:09.189 --> 13:10.891
I DON'T WANT TASHA
COMING BACK HERE

13:10.891 --> 13:14.264
WITH HER HEAD ON HER HIP
AND HER LEG IN HER MOUTH.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.867
REALLY? NOT EVEN
JUST TO SEE IT?

13:16.867 --> 13:18.128
( beeping )

13:21.231 --> 13:25.005
AND NOW I'LL
HIT "RETURN TO ORIGIN."

13:25.005 --> 13:26.476
( beeping )

13:29.509 --> 13:31.241
VOILA.

13:33.343 --> 13:34.885
( squeals )

13:35.916 --> 13:38.188
IS "VOILA" FRENCH FOR "FAIL,"

13:38.188 --> 13:41.391
OR AM I NOT UNDERSTANDING
THIS COMPLEX SITUATION?

13:43.854 --> 13:45.555
( Leo screaming )

13:52.532 --> 13:54.564
YOU'RE QUICKER
THAN I THOUGHT.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.236
GOOD THING I ADDED THIS.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.237
( beeps )

13:57.237 --> 13:59.239
( screaming )

13:59.239 --> 14:00.370
OH! OKAY!

14:00.370 --> 14:02.012
( screaming )

14:03.443 --> 14:06.476
AHA. I HAVE A WEAPON,
NOW, TOO.

14:08.178 --> 14:09.519
THAT'S A STAPLER.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.283
SO IT IS.

14:14.284 --> 14:16.856
JUST KIDDING.
IT'S A RAY GUN.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.857
DANG IT!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.259
( laser zapping )

14:21.231 --> 14:24.134
( screaming )

14:27.537 --> 14:29.099
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

14:29.099 --> 14:31.141
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
MY SOFTWARE UPDATE WOULD WORK!

14:31.141 --> 14:33.373
HMM. DOES THAT
 LOOK LIKE IT WORKED?

14:38.548 --> 14:41.051
I KNOW THESE HANDLEBARS.

14:41.051 --> 14:43.013
DID YOU JUST TRY TO TELEPORT

14:43.013 --> 14:44.985
MY ONE-OF-A-KIND,
PROTOTYPE,

14:44.985 --> 14:46.186
HYBRID A.T.V.?

14:47.918 --> 14:50.260
NO.
 ( stammers )

14:50.260 --> 14:51.391
MAYBE?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.492
MMM!

14:52.492 --> 14:54.965
I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO "NO."

14:54.965 --> 14:56.196
MMM!

14:56.196 --> 14:59.299
WOW. IF HE'S THIS MAD
ABOUT HIS A.T.V.,

14:59.299 --> 15:01.901
WAIT UNTIL HE FINDS OUT
WE PUT TASHA THROUGH THERE.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.103
WHAT?!

15:04.134 --> 15:07.007
YOU PUT MY WIFE
THROUGH THE TELEPORTER?!

15:07.007 --> 15:09.139
ENJOY IT, DUDE.
TAKE A DAY OFF.

15:09.139 --> 15:11.041
AAH!

15:11.041 --> 15:12.512
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE...

15:12.512 --> 15:14.114
WHEREVER...

15:14.114 --> 15:16.486
OR WHATEVER SHE IS.

15:18.248 --> 15:21.191
YEAH! WE JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

15:21.191 --> 15:23.493
TO GET HER BACK HERE
WITHOUT TURNING HER INTO...

15:23.493 --> 15:25.455
TASHA TARTARE.

15:25.455 --> 15:28.258
( breathlessly )
OKAY, OKAY.

15:28.258 --> 15:29.399
LET'S NOT PANIC.

15:29.399 --> 15:32.332
I'M SURE ONE OF MY
SOFTWARE PATCHES CAN FIX THIS.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.205
I'VE ALREADY TRIED THEM ALL.
NONE OF THEM WORKED.

15:35.205 --> 15:36.206
( shrieks )

15:36.206 --> 15:37.537
( gasping )

15:37.537 --> 15:41.211
YOU KNOW,
I HAD A SIMPLE SOLUTION.

15:41.211 --> 15:42.412
SIMPLE SOLUTION.

15:42.412 --> 15:44.214
UM, ADAM...

15:44.214 --> 15:46.616
YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
WHEN WE LOCKED THE KEYS
IN THE CAR,

15:46.616 --> 15:49.349
AND IT TOOK US THREE HOURS
TO GET THEM OUT?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.181
YEAH.

15:51.181 --> 15:53.523
YOU WERE INSIDE THE CAR!

15:55.055 --> 15:57.487
( muttering, whimpering )

15:58.658 --> 16:00.560
AAH!

16:04.734 --> 16:06.436
GAME OVER, LEO.

16:06.436 --> 16:10.500
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR MY ROBOT'S AWESOME
PHYSICAL STRENGTH.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.473
WELL...YEAH.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.405
I AM NO MATCH
FOR HIS STRENGTH.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.447
BUT JUST REMEMBER,

16:17.447 --> 16:20.180
YOU DIDN'T BEAT ME.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.182
THIS THING DID.

16:23.313 --> 16:26.116
PLEASE.
I COULD PULVERIZE YOU.

16:26.116 --> 16:27.287
( chuckles )
 YEAH.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.259
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

16:29.259 --> 16:31.661
NOT SMART, LEO.

16:31.661 --> 16:33.623
THE ROBOT WOULD'VE
BEEN QUICK AND PAINLESS

16:33.623 --> 16:35.425
COMPARED TO WHAT
I'M GONNA DO TO YOU.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.527
OKAY, TOUGH GUY.

16:37.527 --> 16:40.730
BUT IF I WIN,
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO. DEAL?

16:40.730 --> 16:43.173
( scoffs )
 YEAH.

16:43.173 --> 16:44.234
DEAL.

16:44.234 --> 16:46.206
( beeping )

16:46.206 --> 16:47.407
( grunts )

16:50.080 --> 16:51.281
LET'S SHAKE ON IT.

16:53.243 --> 16:56.286
( slurps )
 EW!

16:57.287 --> 16:59.549
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

16:59.549 --> 17:03.223
BECAUSE I'M CLEVER,
AND CLEVER BEATS STRONG
ANY DAY.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.223
( beeping )

17:06.796 --> 17:10.430
BUT CLEVER WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING'S
OWNER'S MANUAL.

17:13.203 --> 17:14.263
( beeping )

17:30.780 --> 17:32.522
OH, MAN!

17:32.522 --> 17:34.654
THAT WAS MY DAD'S
 FAVORITE TOY!

17:34.654 --> 17:37.157
THERE GOES PIZZA NIGHT.

17:39.329 --> 17:41.361
THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, LEO!

17:43.563 --> 17:44.694
( yells )

17:49.199 --> 17:52.142
OKAY, THIS IS OUR LAST
POSSIBLE FIX.

17:52.142 --> 17:54.674
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK...
I DON'T EVEN WANNA SAY IT.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.446
SAY IT. SAY IT.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.380
OKAY, FINGERS CROSSED.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.252
THIS BRINGS TASHA BACK

18:02.252 --> 18:05.185
IN THREE...TWO...

18:08.188 --> 18:10.420
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?!

18:10.420 --> 18:12.362
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.

18:13.323 --> 18:16.326
EW, SHE'S
HIDEOUSLY DEFORMED!

18:16.326 --> 18:18.228
LOOK AWAY! LOOK AWAY!

18:18.228 --> 18:19.369
( imitates buzzer )

18:21.331 --> 18:24.534
OH, DON'T HUG HER TOO HARD.
HER GUTS MIGHT COME
SQUISHING OUT.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.876
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE WERE YOU?

18:26.876 --> 18:29.739
200 MILES AWAY IN FRESNO.

18:29.739 --> 18:32.442
THANKFULLY, ADAM
WAS SMART ENOUGH
TO CALL MY CELL PHONE

18:32.442 --> 18:35.185
AND TELL ME YOU GUYS
ACCIDENTALLY TELEPLANTED ME.

18:35.185 --> 18:38.348
WELL, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S "TELEPORTED."

18:38.348 --> 18:39.549
TELE-SOMEONE-WHO-CARES.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.293
I'M JUST GLAD HE CALLED ME
BEFORE MY CELL PHONE DIED...

18:43.293 --> 18:46.526
SINCE, OBVIOUSLY, NO ONE ELSE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

18:51.301 --> 18:54.133
I FIGURED IF TASHA DIDN'T
RETURN THROUGH THE TELEPORTER,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.767
SHE COULDN'T END UP BACK HERE
IN A BIG, STEAMING PILE OF MOM.

18:59.309 --> 19:02.442
SO, I CALLED.
TOLD HER TO TAKE
THE BUS HOME.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.245
WHICH I DID.
AND IT WAS WEIRD.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.317
THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME
WAS WEARING A TANK TOP.

19:07.317 --> 19:08.378
WHY WAS THAT WEIRD?

19:08.378 --> 19:10.620
JUST A TANK TOP.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.254
TOLD YOU I HAD
A SIMPLE SOLUTION.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.386
ADAM...

19:16.386 --> 19:18.758
WE MAY HAVE
SAID SOME THINGS EARLIER...

19:18.758 --> 19:21.561
DUH. WE SAY THINGS EVERY DAY.
COULD YOU NARROW IT DOWN?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.333
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY

19:23.333 --> 19:25.195
IS, "WE OWE YOU AN APOLOGY."

19:25.195 --> 19:26.536
I'M SORRY. A WHAT?

19:26.536 --> 19:28.498
AN APOLOGY.

19:28.498 --> 19:31.201
SO I GUESS I'LL
START OFF BY SAYING...

19:31.201 --> 19:32.742
THAT I...AM--

19:32.742 --> 19:33.943
I'M BACK!

19:33.943 --> 19:36.346
OH, THANK YOU!

19:36.346 --> 19:37.707
RIGHT HERE, ON MY PHONE,

19:37.707 --> 19:40.280
I HAVE UNDENIABLE PROOF
THAT MARCUS IS--

19:43.513 --> 19:45.415
WHERE'D MY PHONE JUST GO?

19:47.457 --> 19:48.758
HONOLULU.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.691
( chuckles )
 BUT WE CAN BRING IT BACK...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.623
RIGHT HERE.
 ( beeping )

19:59.529 --> 20:01.571
( screaming )
 NO!

20:03.703 --> 20:05.635
( Leo whimpering )
BUT IT HAD EVIDENCE.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.907
YEAH. BUS WAS A GOOD CALL.

20:17.847 --> 20:19.749
YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:19.749 --> 20:22.322
THIS BARBEQUE
HAD A TOUCH PAD IN IT.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.594
( chuckles )
 LEO...

20:24.594 --> 20:27.527
ARE SURE YOU
WEREN'T AT THE A.T.M.
OUTSIDE THE CHICKEN SHACK?

20:29.329 --> 20:32.262
DON'T YOU TAKE THAT "LEO'S
GOT A WILD IMAGINATION"
TONE WITH ME.

20:32.262 --> 20:34.003
THE TOUCH PAD CONTROLLED
THAT DISSOLVING WALL.

20:34.003 --> 20:35.665
OH, RIGHT.

20:35.665 --> 20:38.408
AND THEN ALL THE LITTLE ELVES
CAME OUT AND DID A MOON DANCE

20:38.408 --> 20:40.370
AROUND THE BONFIRE.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.642
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.013
I BELIEVE YOU, LEO.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.846
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE,
AS A FAMILY,

20:46.846 --> 20:50.650
ARE GOING TO GET YOU THE HELP
YOU SO DESPERATELY NEED.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.383
YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND!

20:53.383 --> 20:55.685
MARCUS AND HIS FATHER
HAVE A SECRET LAIR!

20:55.685 --> 20:59.028
OKAY, GUYS, ARE WE
ROASTING WEENIES OR NOT?!

21:00.330 --> 21:02.592
COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO.

21:02.592 --> 21:05.565
DON'T LEAVE.
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!

21:19.048 --> 21:22.452
OKAY, I KNOW.
I MESSED UP.

21:22.452 --> 21:24.484
BUT I CAN FIX THIS.
 NO.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.916
YOU LET HIM GET TOO CLOSE!

21:28.588 --> 21:32.522
IT'S TIME I TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

21:32.522 --> 21:36.025
I HOPE THEY ENJOY THEIR
NIGHT TOGETHER.

21:36.025 --> 21:38.668
IT'S GONNA BE THEIR LAST.

21:38.668 --> 21:39.899

21:41.731 --> 21:43.733

22:08.798 --> 22:10.500
