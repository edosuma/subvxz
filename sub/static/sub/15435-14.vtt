WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.000
Previously on "brothers & sisters"

00:02.000 --> 00:05.400
Tonight i am suspending my campaign for the republican nomination.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.900
Do you have any idea how many people

00:06.900 --> 00:09.400
Are begging me to get them into a
deal in china?

00:09.400 --> 00:10.500
We can't do the deal.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.000
I can't be objective. I'm
emotionally involved with him.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.100
Do you have any idea how hard
graham has worked on this?

00:15.100 --> 00:17.300
Could you get me off the hook?

00:17.300 --> 00:18.800
You have 12 doses here,

00:18.800 --> 00:21.000
Then you'll come back and
we'll harvest your eggs.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.600
Your mom was, uh, accusing david of implying that he's your father.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.500
I mean, have you ever thought that
- Of course.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.200
Look, i mean, if it's getting
to you, why don't you just get,like, a test or something?

00:29.200 --> 00:31.800
Don't say
good-Bye, okay? We're gonna see each other.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.900
- So long, then.
- So long, isaac.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.700
Taylor wants to come here
for a meeting.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.100
He's reaching out to you
for the v.P. Spot.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.600
Okay, we have 3 4-

00:43.700 --> 00:44.900
Double-As...

00:44.900 --> 00:47.200
That's like an a-Plus,
summa cum laude of embryos-

00:47.200 --> 00:49.700
And then we have two abs, all
right.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.000
And th-That's an a-Minus?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.800
But they could end up
having a better personality,

00:52.900 --> 00:55.600
Or-Or, you know,
they could be artistic or...

00:56.900 --> 00:58.000
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.400
What do you think?

01:00.600 --> 01:02.800
I- I think that
they look like bubbles.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.400
Smart, cute, artistic bubbles.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.600
Kitty, the embryologist
is gonna tell us which ones to implant.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.500
Suppose we
end up with triplets?

01:13.900 --> 01:16.200
Let's pretend that
that is not an option.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.600
I wonder if the white house
has ever had triplets...

01:19.600 --> 01:23.000
Well, i mean,
not that the v.P.Technically lives
in the white house.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.500
- Stop. First of all, we are
not having triplets.
- Really?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.200
And second of all, i'm not
gonna be the vice president

01:28.200 --> 01:29.800
Because no one's asking.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.200
So why do you suppose
the republican nominee

01:33.200 --> 01:35.700
Is coming over to our house
this afternoon?

01:35.700 --> 01:37.300
He wants my support.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.600
He's trying
to carry california.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.400
Well, what if he does ask?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.000
What if he does?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I mean, nobody-Nobody
turns down the vice presidency.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.200
There are people out there shamelessly auditioning
for the role.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.000
I mean, we could sit here
and debate hypotheticals,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.500
But he'll ask us
whatever he wants to ask us when he gets here.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.200
Robert, we know what he wants.
He wants you to be the v.P.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.900
So what, is it
mother's day already?

02:09.900 --> 02:10.900
Whoa, mom.
Mom, hi!

02:10.900 --> 02:13.200
We don't need a holiday to
appreciate our mom.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.100
Since when?

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
Since now, mom.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.800
Hey, sorry i'm
late, but i got the brioche.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.300
Oh! Brioche from emil's,
my favorite bakery?

02:21.300 --> 02:23.200
Oh, what a coincidence.
You're dead.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.800
All right, all right,
guys, you know what?

02:24.800 --> 02:28.400
I really appreciate
your concern, but i'm fine.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.800
Um, well, thank you, tommy.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.500
Mom, you really
don't have to put an act on.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.600
I mean, it's normal
to be depressed.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.500
You were practically living with
isaac.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.200
I'm not depressed, honestly.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.800
Isaac is a wonderful man,

02:39.800 --> 02:42.600
And we had
a wonderful time... together,

02:42.600 --> 02:44.200
But this is what i want.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.000
This is what you want-

02:45.000 --> 02:46.300
All alone in this big, empty
house?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.800
- Hello, i live here.
- Exactly.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.700
Let's not get into
your problems, all right?

02:49.700 --> 02:51.100
Yeah. You know, no one's
gonna blame you for being sad.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.800
It's not easy bouncing back from a
breakup.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.700
Yeah, especially at your age.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.800
<i>But i'm not bouncing back,
even at my age.</i>

02:56.900 --> 02:59.200
I'm not bouncing. I'm busy.
I'm very, very busy.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.100
I've got the pasadena children's
hospital fund-Raiser tonight,

03:02.200 --> 03:03.700
Which is a full-Time job...

03:03.800 --> 03:04.600
And you remember...

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
We all have to go.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.400
Yeah.
Yeah, mandatory.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.500
At least something
has sunk in.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.100
And then i have jamie
coming this afternoon.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.500
- Jamie?
- Oh, no. Oh, this is bad.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.200
- Who's jamie?
- Mom's interior designer.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.500
Yeah, when she
turns up, it's like a maternal distress call.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.700
When kitty went to new york,
within 24 hours,

03:22.700 --> 03:24.700
All the kitchen cabinetry - Gutted.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.500
Well, you know, the cabinetry was awful.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.500
It was dingy. It was maple.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
When
i-When i enlisted in the army- All new wallpaper upstairs.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.600
How about
when i came out? Most parents just cry.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
Mom rips out the entire backyard.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.300
Nothing
but dirt, dumpsters and porta-Potties

03:37.300 --> 03:38.300
- For, like, two years.
- Yeah.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.900
Oh, well, i thought kevin would
have a lot more pool parties.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.200
I was trying to be supportive.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.700
Yeah, i do like pool parties.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.200
There you have it.
There you-All right, all right.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.300
Maybe i have dealt with some
difficult situations in the past

03:49.400 --> 03:51.100
By immersing myself
in the house,

03:51.100 --> 03:53.700
But this is not one of those situations.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.700
- Understood?
- Yeah, sure.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.000
We get it. Yeah, mom, whatever you say.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.600
Yes. Fine.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.400
Where is that
fabulous brunch i was promised?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.600
Pass this down.
Uh, i have to take mine to go.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.500
I have to get a dress
for tonight.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.900
My formal event wardrobe is pretty nonexistent.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.400
Oh,hey, if you're still out shopping this afternoon, call me.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.900
I need no excuse to buy myself a little
new something.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.300
Yeah, cool, i will.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.800
- Oh, bye.
- Bye.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.700
- All right, i'll be back
in two seconds.
- Okay.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.200
Becca...
any-Any word?

04:23.700 --> 04:25.700
Uh, they said
today's the latest, so...

04:25.700 --> 04:26.400
Oh, good.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, yeah. Gosh, if it
turns out i'm not a walker,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.600
Your mom's gonna
build a third floor...

04:31.900 --> 04:33.000
Maybe a game room.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.900
That's not a bad deal- Lose a sister,
gain a ping-Pong table.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.800
Mom hates ping-Pong,
and we're not losing a sister.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.800
If david's my father,
everything's gonna change.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.300
No, not everything.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.300
That's true.
Some things are constant,

04:46.300 --> 04:49.100
Like my mother being
a pathological liar, but...

04:49.500 --> 04:51.800
He rest, i'm... i don't know.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.700
Look, whatever
the test results are, you know,

04:53.800 --> 04:56.300
We're not going anywhere. I'm-I'm not going anywhere.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.600
- You don't know that.
- I do.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.400
You can't
get rid of me that easy.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.000
I have no friends.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.100
That's true. All right.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I'll call you
as soon as i know, okay?

05:15.200 --> 05:17.100
Oh, for god sake, robert,
when you go out running,

05:17.100 --> 05:18.500
You're supposed
to bring your keys.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.100
You're not supposed to go out
and lock the door

05:20.100 --> 05:22.100
And then not bring your keys,
so when you're in the bathtub,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.700
I have to get up, and i have
to let you in to the house,

05:24.700 --> 05:26.200
And i don't have to...

05:28.200 --> 05:29.600
Good morning, kitty.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.300
Good morning,
congressman taylor.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
I can see
you've been expecting me.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.200
Yes, yes, i hear you.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.500
I'm just not convinced
we can continue to bail out

05:48.500 --> 05:51.200
The developing world
with our tax dollars.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.500
Sure.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.000
Bye, fred.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.800
Pretty long run he's taking.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.800
<i>Yeah, i guess if you'd only been
one hour early, he'd be here.</i>

05:59.800 --> 06:02.600
Well, i didn't want the press
to get wind of our meeting,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.100
So i thought i'd take a shot,
but that's all right.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.300
This gives us a chance to get
to know each other better.

06:06.300 --> 06:09.400
I don't think that's necessary,
with all due respect.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.400
All right then, we can just sit
here in awkward silence.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
- Ready?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
- Ready.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
Go.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.500
All right, fine.
Let's get to know each other.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.900
What's your favorite color?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.900
Green. I wear boxers,
love black licorice,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.200
<i>Can't stand lima beans.</i>

06:34.200 --> 06:36.500
Why are you here? I mean, really.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.900
I think it's about time robert and i buried
the hatchet.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.000
Oh, i can think of a few places i'd like to bury the hatchet.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.900
Oh, you seem to forget that he said some nasty things about me, too.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.800
He said some nasty things about your record

06:46.800 --> 06:48.600
And some of the positions
that you take,

06:48.700 --> 06:51.200
<i>But see,
you made it personal.</i>

06:51.900 --> 06:54.900
You called him a philanderer,
a turncoat,

06:55.000 --> 06:56.500
A hair candidate.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.700
If you look closely,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.400
You'll see that i didn't say
any of those things.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.200
No, just somebody on your payroll

07:01.200 --> 07:05.100
Or a few anonymous op-Ed pieces
that you no doubt approved.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.300
All's fair in politics.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.200
I think you mean
"love and war."

07:09.200 --> 07:13.000
<i>Politics is love and war,
at least when you do it right.</i>

07:13.100 --> 07:15.800
You didn't take to it,
did you-

07:16.100 --> 07:18.100
The campaigning
and the interviews?

07:18.100 --> 07:20.300
You know, i was robert's
communications director.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.800
I'm proud of the work i did.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.000
I'm not talking
about your job.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.200
I'm talking
about being the wife.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.800
Now maggie-
She loves it, all of it-

07:29.800 --> 07:33.500
The traveling, the rallies,even the $5,000-A-Plate
dinners...

07:33.800 --> 07:35.300
All the asses to kiss.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.100
I certainly don't miss
the asses.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.900
Well, there are two types
of political wives-

07:41.000 --> 07:43.600
Those who are cut out for it
and the others.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.800
Mm. I suppose
i'm an "other"?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.800
I'm just making conversation.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.200
Guess who showed up early.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.200
Yeah, i figured when i saw
the cadre of secret service out front.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.400
- Boyd.
- Robert.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.600
I'm just gonna change. I'll be right back.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.300
Uh, honey, you need-
You need to hurry up.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.000
I'm drowning in his smugness
and-And his aftershave.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.300
Look, he came early to try
to throw me off my game.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.000
Now it's his turn to wait.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.000
Oh, well, thanks.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.300
So you got any coffee,

08:12.400 --> 08:15.600
Or do you only drink green tea
on this coast?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
This is not
what it looks like, okay? Justin gave me this

08:23.600 --> 08:25.700
'Cause i'm going surfing
with him and tommy.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.100
Oh, good.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.600
I was worried the oxycodone
was making me hallucinate.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.900
- Oxycodone?
- A battle with a very sharp paring knife.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.299
The paring knife won.

08:34.299 --> 08:35.500
I don't know what was
more painful-

08:35.500 --> 08:37.900
The seven stitches or the
hospital bill.

08:37.900 --> 08:38.799
Ooh. How bad?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.400
Uh, tetanus shot, $25...

08:42.100 --> 08:44.400
Stitches
in the e.R., $2,500. Whew.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
Absence of health insurance...
priceless.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.000
You're walking around
without health insurance?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.400
<i>I can't afford health insurance.
I can't afford rent.</i>

08:50.400 --> 08:51.500
Remember? That's why i moved in with you.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.300
Okay, next time, what if it's worse than a cut?

08:53.300 --> 08:53.900
<i>You have to have health insurance. Come on.</i>

08:53.900 --> 08:56.900
Kevin, please, no lectures. I'm very low on blood.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.700
Okay, i'm sorry. You know, i'm concerned.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.300
Well, i'll figure
something out. I always do.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.200
All right, so are you
willing to go bold?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.500
Well, "bold" sounds good.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.200
All right.Red walls.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
In feng shul,

09:12.200 --> 09:16.200
It is
the ultimate color of power,passion and excitement.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.900
Maybe that's
a little too bold.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.500
Okay. Um, i did this room
for a couple in santa monica-

09:21.600 --> 09:24.100
Simple, minimalist, serene.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.200
There's nothing in this room.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.000
There's air and light.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.400
Well, there's no things. I
- I need my things.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.000
<i>I need books and pillows
and rugs and things.</i>

09:31.100 --> 09:33.700
Okay, maybe we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.400
Um, what do you need
this room to function as?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.300
A living room.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.100
<i>No, i mean what kind of living
do you want to do in here?</i>

09:42.100 --> 09:43.900
What do you need from this room?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.700
- Need?
- Yes, need.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.000
I have no idea what i need.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.000
We have a similar vision
for this country.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.900
We both believe
the conservative philosophy

09:53.900 --> 09:56.100
Is the best way
to achieve that vision,

09:56.500 --> 10:00.000
Which, let's face it,doesn't play well
in the liberal states.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.900
Look, boyd, your campaign
called me a liar, a cheater,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.800
Defiled my war record.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.700
So if you've come here
wanting something from me,

10:08.700 --> 10:11.500
I'd appreciate it if you
just came right out and asked.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.900
Join the ticket.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.400
I'd like you to be
my vice president.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.900
We could drive
up the coast next weekend,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.800
Just the two of us.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.800
Big sur is so beautiful
in the spring.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.600
What?
You think it's too soon?

10:31.600 --> 10:34.000
Oh, no, no.I- I'd love to go away
with you for the weekend.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.800
It's just

10:35.800 --> 10:38.500
It's a little pricey,
at least for me.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.400
It's my treat.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.700
David, i want
to go away with you,

10:42.700 --> 10:44.300
And my financial situation,

10:44.300 --> 10:47.100
For the first time
in my life, is good.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.300
I enjoy
sharing my good fortune

10:50.300 --> 10:52.800
With people
that i care about.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.500
Oh, so you care about me.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.500
Mm, well,
if that's what it takes to get you to say yes

11:00.500 --> 11:04.400
To 1,000-Thread-Count sheets and an infinity pool.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.100
All right.
Make the reservation.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.800
And for the record,
i care about you, too.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.100
Hello.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.600
Ew. You realize your room
is right over there?

11:16.600 --> 11:20.100
Ha ha ha.
What you got there?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.400
Oh, just a few dresses.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.900
Couldn't really pick one,
so i bought all three.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.900
But don't worry, i will return
the other two.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.400
I'm not worried.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.600
I gotta get this. Sorry.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.200
I've gotta get going, too.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.400
I have got a pile of work
to get through

11:36.400 --> 11:38.200
If we're gonna
go away next weekend.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.500
Yeah, i probably should, um...

11:40.600 --> 11:42.900
Who am i kidding?
I don't have anything to do.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
- See ya.
- Yeah.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.900
Where did she go?

11:51.400 --> 11:54.000
Your mom? She just,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.400
You can probably still
catch her if you want.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.300
Is something wrong?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.500
Did you know
this whole time?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.100
Did i know what?

12:03.200 --> 12:05.000
That you're my father?

12:11.800 --> 12:14.000
Every inch
of my body is throbbing,

12:14.100 --> 12:15.400
And not in a good way.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.800
I don't think i can make
mom's thing tonight.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.500
It's not a thing,
it's a fund-Raiser for kids with cancer.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.200
Yeah, and
if we have to go, you have to go.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.600
Okay, fine, i'll hit scotty
for some oxycodone.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.100
Forget i said that.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.900
Dude, you can say "oxycodone" without me going
back into rehab.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.300
And why is scotty on oxycodone?

12:30.300 --> 12:31.900
To ease the pain of dating kevin.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.900
He practically
sliced his hand off-

12:34.300 --> 12:36.900
Seven stitches, an e.R. Visit-
An outrageous bill.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.500
You know, he works
70 hours a week,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.300
And he still can't afford
health insurance.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.700
Gotta love america.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.700
Enough with
the michael moore bull, all right?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.300
Just put him on your
insurance.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.700
Yeah, can't you just make him like,
your domesticated partner?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.300
<i>Domestic partner, moron.
He's not a pet.</i>

12:50.400 --> 12:53.000
You know, you can both stop
with the relationship advice.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.900
You're up to your eyeballs
in couples counseling,

12:54.900 --> 12:57.800
And the closest thing you've got
to a girlfriend is rebecca.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
Oh, that's hilarious.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.100
Hey, what's up
with rebecca, anyway?

13:03.100 --> 13:05.000
She was acting
really weird this morning.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.600
She's going through some
personal stuff right now. That's all.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.100
"Personal" as in
"none of your business."

13:11.100 --> 13:12.200
What do you mean? She's our
sister.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
Yeah, we have a code.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.500
If we have anything on a sibling, we
spill.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.900
Yeah, well, it's different with her.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.900
Oh, so if it was kitty
or sarah, you'd tell?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.400
I've known kitty and sarah
since i was born, okay?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.600
I mean, they've seen me naked.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.400
Yeah, what if rebecca saw you naked?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.400
That's creepy, bro.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.500
You're the one
who brought up sisters and nudity.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.700
Uh, uh, we've known rebecca
for what, a year?

13:29.700 --> 13:32.100
I've been telling on kitty
and sarah since i could talk.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.500
Look, we just don't have
that history with rebecca.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.600
Oh, my god. She's gay.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.100
<i>She's not gay.
Is she gay?</i>

13:40.100 --> 13:41.800
No, she's not gay.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.600
Look, this is no big deal,
all right? Conversation over.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.100
How is it that??? At business school,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.800
But the phrase
"paper jam area 'b'"

13:55.900 --> 13:57.800
Just sends me over the edge?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.600
I- If i can be
of any help, you know,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.800
Relieving your tension,
uh, i'm here to serve.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.600
Oh, uh, saul's down the hall.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.100
Oh, yes, i know.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.600
So the, uh, golden plum deal
is all signed and official,

14:12.700 --> 14:13.900
Saul's wired all the money,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.500
So i think we should go
celebrate, don't you?

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
What?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.100
The expansion.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.000
Oh, you're not having
buyer's remorse, are you?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
No.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.900
What were you thinking?

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I gave you instructions to tell
graham that the deal was off.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.600
Look, sarah,
i did what i felt was best,

14:34.600 --> 14:36.600
And you know as well as i do
that as c.F.O.,

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
I have the right
to procure funds,

14:37.600 --> 14:38.800
I have the right
to sign checks,

14:38.800 --> 14:41.600
And i have the right
to okay deals as i see fit.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.500
Not if the president
has explicitly said not to.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.600
That is fraud.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.700
Fraud?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.800
Well, then why don't you
bring me up on charges?

14:49.900 --> 14:52.800
It would certainly
get you out of golden plum and all the ancillary deals.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.800
Why don't you arrest me?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.500
Maybe i should.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.800
Graham and i did
our due diligence.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.800
We checked out
all the variables.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.100
Maybe it's time for you to have
some faith in my judgment.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.800
Faith?
After what you've done?

15:11.900 --> 15:13.400
I've been working
in this company

15:13.400 --> 15:15.800
Almost as long
as you're alive. You know that?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.500
With your dad, with tommy...

15:19.900 --> 15:21.600
And now you.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.200
Why wouldn't any of you
have any faith

15:23.200 --> 15:25.800
That i just might know
what i was doing?

15:34.300 --> 15:35.800
No, of course.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.700
Right.
Well, thank you very much.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.300
He asked.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.800
I mean, he pontificated for
an hour about how great he was,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.900
But then he asked me
to join the ticket as the vice president.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Wow! So-So what?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.300
So-So congratulations?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.900
I mean, can you believe it?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.300
After....£¿£¿£¿

16:00.300 --> 16:02.200
We could run together???

16:02.200 --> 16:05.000
I mean, well, of course you can.
You're the one who called it.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.700
Yeah, i'm a regular
amazing kreskin.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.900
What's wrong?

16:09.900 --> 16:11.300
Uh, nothing.
Nothing's wrong.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.400
I just, uh,
just trying to figure out

16:14.400 --> 16:15.700
What i'm gonna wear tonight.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.000
He told me i'd have a major voice in the administration.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.400
- Yeah, well, if he listens.
- He doesn't have a choice.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.000
He's got to adopt
some of my policies

16:24.000 --> 16:26.400
If he wants the moderates,
and he can't win without 'em.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.000
Wow. Wow, you sound like
you've already accepted.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I didn't know i had a choice.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.300
You're the one who told me that nobody turns down
the vice presidency.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
It's so funny how you
can always remember what i say

16:39.000 --> 16:41.200
When you're trying to bolster your argument.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.600
I'm not arguing.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.300
I told him we'd take this
evening and talk about it.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.100
Great, so between the hors d'oeuvres and speeches about pediatric cancer,

16:48.100 --> 16:50.500
We're gonna make a decision that affects
the rest of our lives?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.200
I know it's a lot to process,but...

16:53.500 --> 16:55.600
Hello.
It's tim from the r.N.C.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.300
Oh, no, sure, go.
Go take it.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.900
Yeah, tim, he just left.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.800
Uh, yes, we did.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.599
I asked her point-Blank
if william walker was my father.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.400
She swore.
She swore i was his daughter.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.900
She lied to me. She lied to you. She lied to him!

17:08.900 --> 17:10.900
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it complicated?

17:10.900 --> 17:12.500
She's a liar who hopped
from bed to bed

17:12.500 --> 17:13.700
And didn't even know who
fathered her own baby.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.900
The only reason
she picked william

17:14.900 --> 17:16.599
Is because he had
the bigger bank account.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.800
I'm an idiot.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.900
I really thought,
in spite of everything,

17:20.900 --> 17:22.599
That she loved me, that i matter.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.000
- You do.Your mother loves you more than anything.
- She loves herself.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.700
There's no room for anybody else.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.900
Is any of this
even fazing you?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Or are you too busy defending her to react to the fact
that you've got a daughter?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.100
Hey, it's a girl!

17:35.700 --> 17:38.600
Does that even get
a freaking response from you?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.500
Or did you know?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.700
Answer me! Did you know?

17:50.200 --> 17:53.300
The timing...
you know, it was suspect,

17:53.300 --> 17:56.400
And-And, um,
when i asked your mother,

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
She admitted that there
was a chance,

17:58.700 --> 17:59.900
But given how slight it was,

17:59.900 --> 18:01.700
We both thought it would be better if we didn't

18:01.700 --> 18:04.300
- To what? To what? To leave me in the dark?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.500
To not have to deal
with the fact that you've got a daughter?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.200
Were you relieved
when she told you?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.200
Were you-Were you happy?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.100
Were you sad? Were you bummed
that you never got to know me?

18:15.100 --> 18:16.200
How did you feel?

18:16.200 --> 18:20.000
I wish i had a-A simple
and perfect answer for you,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.500
But i don't.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.600
All i know is that

18:23.600 --> 18:26.200
I was in no shape to be a father to you back then.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.700
I was a self-Absorbed
coke addict,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.600
And you didn't deserve to
grow up with that.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.400
Right.Because growing up without
a dad was such a blast.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
Oh, god, look at you. You're
smart and you're beautiful

18:36.600 --> 18:38.800
And you're funny, and that's
because of your mother.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.500
Oh, stop defending her!

18:41.600 --> 18:44.300
Do you have any idea
what she's put me through?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.400
She let me live
at nora's house, okay?

18:48.400 --> 18:52.000
She let me believe that
i was a part of their family.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.100
I fell in love
with that family.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.400
God, they're expecting me
at that fund-Raiser tonight.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.600
Family dinners
and birthday parties...

19:08.600 --> 19:09.700
You don't have to lose that.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.800
What am i supposed to do,
just sit there, pretend i'm related to them?

19:14.500 --> 19:18.400
Rebecca, i was a... a crappy
boyfriend to your mother,

19:18.400 --> 19:21.600
???I would have been
a horrible father to you.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.700
You deserved better than me.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.600
You deserve to be happy.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.200
<i>I was happy.</i>

19:29.700 --> 19:32.300
For the first time
in my life, i was happy.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.700
I'm sorry.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
We'll figure something out.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.100
Okay? I promise.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.100
I'm gonna make this okay.

19:47.900 --> 19:48.900
There he is.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.600
Senator mccallister,
are the rumors true?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.500
Did taylor
offer you the second slot?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.600
I'm, uh, i'm gonna, um, meet you inside, okay?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.200
Any comment at all tonight, sir?

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
Tonight is really about the pasadena
children's hospital.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.300
Both kitty and i are happy
to be here to honor them

20:03.300 --> 20:05.500
And their work
with pediatric oncology.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.900
The drudge report
is saying it's a done deal. Sir, do you care to comment?

20:08.900 --> 20:11.200
Congressmantaylor and i met briefly today.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yes.
Lovely.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Hey, guys.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.900
Tommy, how's elizabeth?

20:18.900 --> 20:21.000
She's, uh, she's fine.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.800
Uh, it's just a cold,
but she's so cranky,

20:22.800 --> 20:25.200
Julia didn't want to inflict her on some poor babysitter.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.200
- At least she doesn't have cancer.
- Kevin.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.300
Forever the optimist.
You know what i mean.

20:28.300 --> 20:31.500
Hey, kitty! Oh, where's robert?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.000
Oh, basking in the glow of the spotlight.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
- Who can tell me the quickest
way to a glass of wine?
- Here.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't you have, like, uh, you know,
buns in the oven?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.300
There's actually a few days
between the embryos fertilizing

20:41.300 --> 20:42.800
And then being implanted in her uterus.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.500
- Vintner by day, gynecologist by night.
- That's very good.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.400
His wife went through it.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.200
Ah. How are the little
kidsicles, anyway?

20:51.200 --> 20:54.100
You know, these are
my potential grandbabies we're talking about, so...

20:54.200 --> 20:56.200
???

20:59.100 --> 21:01.000
And you know, tommy, you're really
freaking me out.

21:01.000 --> 21:01.900
Yeah, me, too.

21:01.900 --> 21:02.800
You? Why you?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.600
I wonder
what's keeping saul.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
- Are you okay?

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
Hey, everyone.
- Hmm? Yeah.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.800
Oh, rebecca!

21:08.900 --> 21:11.500
Wow. Oh, my goodness,
you look wonderful.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.500
Thanks.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.100
Thank you so much for coming.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.400
No, no, thanks for having
me.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.000
Oh, look, there's jane.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
If you tell her
she looks younger every year,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.500
Then she doubles the donation. Excuse me.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.100
Uh, you-You look nice.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.400
Thanks. So is that-
How's everyone doing?

21:28.400 --> 21:29.200
I've been better.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.300
Oh, sucktacular.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.200
I'm thinking of starting
a charity of my own-

21:32.200 --> 21:34.300
Stitches for bitches.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.900
I- I thought it was... funny.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.200
No. It was hilarious.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
Jane, you're so
incredibly generous,

21:43.200 --> 21:46.300
And i swear, you do look younger
and younger every year.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.700
I don't know how you do it.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.900
I just wanted to thank you
for everything you've done

21:50.900 --> 21:53.300
To raise money for my son
and families like us.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.100
Oh, well, yes.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.000
Oh, i'm sorry. I'm ellen snyder.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.900
Oh. I-I'm nora walker.
I'm so sorry.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.400
How-How's your son doing?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.000
Good, all things considered.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.900
This hospital
has been a godsend.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.700
Andrew is responding
well to treatment,

22:08.700 --> 22:11.800
And looks like we can go home
and visit in a few weeks.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.500
You're not from here?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.800
No. Oregon.
My husband has a job there.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.600
My daughters are in high school. They
have their lives.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.400
Yeah. Oh, yeah, i-Sarah?

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
Mom, i've gotta
get another drink.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
This cancer thing is such
a downer.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.200
Um, this is ellen.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.400
Her-Her son has leukemia.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.100
I am so sorry. I, uh...

22:30.100 --> 22:32.800
Perhaps you'd like
to go get that drink, yes.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.600
I had an overwhelming urge
to eat tiny pieces of cheese.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.500
So did...
did you hear anything yet?

22:57.300 --> 22:58.900
He's not my father.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.400
<i>David's not my father.</i>

23:05.200 --> 23:08.200
So, uh, wow. So you-
You're still a walker.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.900
Looks like.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.800
Uh, come here. What am-
Uh, what am i thinking?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.000
That-That's great, rebecca.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
That's-That's really-
That's really great.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.600
For a second,
i couldn't tell

23:25.600 --> 23:28.200
???

23:28.500 --> 23:29.600
Why wouldn't i be happy?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.900
This is-This is-
It's wonderful.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.100
Another, please.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.500
Comin' right up.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.400
All right, i-I give.
What's-What's with the mood?

23:44.900 --> 23:46.900
I guess i've got
a lot on my mind.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.500
Okay.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.000
Thank you.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.700
I've gotta ask you, graham.
Did you know?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.200
Um... what?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.200
I asked saul to talk to you,
make up something,

23:58.200 --> 23:59.300
Get us out of it.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.200
Instead he went behind my back,
approved the deal,

24:01.200 --> 24:05.200
And it's left me in
a very uncomfortable position.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.800
Mm-Hmm. And what,
you think i knew this,

24:09.800 --> 24:12.100
And i went along with him
and purposely deceived you?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.500
Is that what you think?

24:13.500 --> 24:16.300
I don't know. Did you?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.900
No, i didn't.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.700
First of all, i assumed
that saul had your approval.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.600
And this deal
is a very good deal.

24:24.700 --> 24:25.600
If you had
any doubts about it,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.300
I wish you'd have
come to me yourself.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.600
Listen, i am conservative when
it comes to this business...

24:32.600 --> 24:35.200
Mm-Hmm. Maybe too conservative,
but it's my family's company.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.900
My father built it
from the ground up,

24:36.900 --> 24:38.200
And he entrusted it to me.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.100
Must've been great, you know,

24:40.400 --> 24:41.700
Someone having that kind
of faith in you,

24:41.800 --> 24:44.600
Trusting the decisions
you made.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.900
Yeah, that must be nice.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.700
I'm supposed to feel bad about that?

24:47.800 --> 24:50.100
I would never tell you
what to do.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.300
Not that you'd listen
to me if i did.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.600
Look, i think
i've figured out a way to solve your problems.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
Mm. You're gonna teach me to devein shrimp with one hand?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.500
Your insurance problems.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.100
If it involves me not having
to take a third job,

25:11.100 --> 25:12.400
I'm all for it.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.500
Why don't we
file for domestic partnership?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.200
-Excuse me?
- It's so simple.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.500
All we have to do
is fill out some forms,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.400
Get them notarized,
and that is that.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.900
We're then recognized
as a couple by the state of california,

25:24.900 --> 25:27.100
And that entitles you to the insurance from my firm-

25:27.100 --> 25:30.800
That's medical, dental, vision, dependent life, accidental death and dismemberment, everything.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.000
Death and dismemberment? Yippee!

25:33.000 --> 25:33.700
What's with the sarcasm?

25:33.700 --> 25:36.100
Nothing.I said i was gonna take care of it, and i will, okay, kevin?

25:36.100 --> 25:38.900
It's my problem, not yours.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.700
Okay, fine.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Hey. I'm starving.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
You want to order thal?

25:55.900 --> 25:59.000
Either your extremely eager
to head up to big sur, or-

25:59.000 --> 26:02.200
I'm sorry, holly.
Uh, a friend of mine called,

26:02.200 --> 26:04.300
And, uh, he's-He's been
working on this project

26:04.400 --> 26:06.600
That he thinks i'm perfect for.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.700
- A project?
- Yeah, it's this, uh, small film,

26:08.700 --> 26:09.700
Shoot ???

26:09.700 --> 26:13.000
Budget's nonexistent,
but, you know, it's a job.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm gonna-I'm gonna take
the red-Eye out tonight.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.800
Wait a minute. You're leaving?
For how long?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.400
I'm not sure.
You know, i...

26:22.400 --> 26:25.000
Look, this is just something
i couldn't pass up.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.700
And... holly,

26:27.700 --> 26:29.700
I- I miss my life-

26:30.000 --> 26:31.400
New york, my loft-

26:31.400 --> 26:34.900
Your loft? You're not
actually going to tell me

26:34.900 --> 26:36.500
That this is about your loft.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.700
Come on, holly. Let's not make
this harder than it has to be.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.000
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
Of-Of course not.</i>

26:42.000 --> 26:45.100
<i>I wouldn't want to make this
hard on you.</i>

26:47.800 --> 26:50.300
I've really enjoyed
seeing you,

26:50.300 --> 26:51.600
Seeing your life.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.200
You really made
something of yourself, hol.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.400
David, wait. Wait.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.700
Just-Just stop.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.200
What is this really about?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.800
I have a life
to get back to.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.200
And i-I know it's sudden,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.200
And you have every right
to be upset.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200
Upset?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.900
Why would you bother
knocking on my door?

27:16.900 --> 27:19.800
Why pursue me?
What's the point?

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
Nostalgia?

27:26.800 --> 27:30.600
I just wanted to be
that 30 year old i was when we were together.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.300
You should go.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.300
Tell rebecca i said good-Bye.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.900
Bye, holly.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.700
We have to talk.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.800
Taylor's waiting
for an answer.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.500
Yeah, well, i don't think you're
gonna like what i have to say.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.300
So you think it's a mistake?

28:23.300 --> 28:27.100
I do. You two disagree
on fundamental issues,

28:27.100 --> 28:29.500
Not to mention he's rigid,
he's incapable of compromise,

28:29.600 --> 28:31.000
And he doesn't want
your advice.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.300
He's-He's just using you,
robert,

28:33.300 --> 28:34.900
To shore up his own
political weakness,

28:34.900 --> 28:37.700
And yes, that's
my professional opinion.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.600
And your personal opinion...

28:40.000 --> 28:41.600
As my wife?

28:43.800 --> 28:44.700
Well...

28:44.700 --> 28:48.400
It's one thing losing you to something that you
deeply believe in,

28:48.400 --> 28:51.900
But it's another thing losing
you to taylor's administration.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.900
<i>No, no.
Your personal opinion-</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.700
About you, not about taylor.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.500
I don't know
if i can do it again...

29:03.600 --> 29:05.100
The campaign and the crowds

29:05.100 --> 29:07.400
And the public weighing in
on our personal decisions.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.600
<i>It's just that, when are we
ever gonna have time for us</i>

29:11.500 --> 29:13.800
This is my life.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.200
Yeah, i know.

29:17.700 --> 29:22.100
And while you were busy
dealing with your life...

29:23.400 --> 29:24.500
The doctor called me
to tell me

29:24.700 --> 29:28.100
That none of our embryos
are viable, not one.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.300
So i'm just wondering
what i'm supposed to do.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.300
Am i supposed to squeeze in
a little egg harvesting

29:32.400 --> 29:34.800
And a little hormone treatment
in between the rallies

29:34.800 --> 29:36.600
And the town hall meetings?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.900
Are you telling me you want me
to turn down the vice presidency

29:42.000 --> 29:43.400
So we can have a baby?

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
No.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.900
I just want you
to want to.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.100
I just want your-Your love
for me

29:51.100 --> 29:54.000
To be more important than-Than your ambition.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.700
Please don't act like
my ambition is something new.

29:56.800 --> 30:00.700
It has always been there.
You were attracted to it.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.800
Yeah.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.400
Well, everything's
different now.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.800
You think i don't know that?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.400
I thought i'd be the one
looking for a running mate.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.900
So please don't tell me
that everything's different.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.900
<i>Are you happy i lost?</i>

30:19.800 --> 30:22.400
How could you
even ask me that?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.300
Well,
i guess i don't have to.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.300
Hi.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.000
How was the fund-Raiser?

30:38.500 --> 30:41.100
It was fine.
I'm really tired, so...

30:42.200 --> 30:44.100
David left.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.300
- He did?
- He took the red-Eye tonight,

30:49.300 --> 30:51.900
And i don't think
he's coming back.

30:52.300 --> 30:56.200
He said he had some "project,"
whatever that means.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.700
Well, you said so yourself.
He's a flake.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.700
I know.I just...

31:01.300 --> 31:03.700
I thought he had changed.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.600
I hoped he had.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.900
Maybe i just wanted him to.

31:13.900 --> 31:17.200
Well, we don't always
get what we want, do we?

31:22.300 --> 31:25.000
Are you here for the ice cream
or because you're worried

31:25.000 --> 31:27.500
About me being alone here
in this big, empty house?

31:27.500 --> 31:31.400
No, i'm worried
about me being all alone in my middle-Sized,
empty house,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.900
And the creamy vanilla
ice cream.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.300
Did you and graham
have a fight?

31:37.700 --> 31:39.200
Mm-Hmm. Yep.

31:39.200 --> 31:42.300
Graham's angry at me.
Saul's angry at me.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.800
They say i don't trust them.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.700
I don't know. I-I have to
listen to my instincts,

31:47.700 --> 31:48.600
But maybe they're right.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.100
Maybe i'm just a big,
fat control freak.

31:51.100 --> 31:55.000
Oh, honey,
i wouldn't say "freak." No.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.400
I mean, you have always beenmore comfortable in a leadership role.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.800
How's that for diplomatic?

31:59.900 --> 32:01.000
Ow!
What?

32:01.000 --> 32:01.900
Brain freeze!

32:01.900 --> 32:04.400
Well, honey,
you took too big a bite.

32:07.300 --> 32:11.800
You know, saul is in
a kind of difficult part of his life right now.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.900
Anything i should
be worried about?

32:14.900 --> 32:16.500
No, no, no.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.400
You get to a certain age,
and you can't help but think about your life,

32:20.800 --> 32:21.900
What you've been through,

32:21.900 --> 32:23.600
Where you want to go next.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.300
For so long,
saul has been living in somebody else's shadow-

32:26.300 --> 32:27.600
First your father's, then yours.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.600
I think sometimes he felt
like a shadow himself.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.100
What should i do?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.000
Be patient.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.600
Trust him.

32:42.300 --> 32:46.300
So have you decided what to do
about the redecoration?

32:46.700 --> 32:48.600
I'm not gonna
touch this house.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.700
Really?

32:50.400 --> 32:51.000
You're kidding.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.400
No. Jamie asked me
what i needed,

32:54.400 --> 32:57.200
And i couldnt' think a single thing.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.200
And then i met ellen tonight,

32:59.200 --> 33:01.300
- That really nice lady at the benefit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:01.300 --> 33:02.900
And she really
does need something.

33:02.900 --> 33:06.300
She needs a home away from home.
Sarah, that's what i want to do.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.300
I want to give ellen

33:07.300 --> 33:10.000
And-And families like hers
a temporary home,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
A place where she
and her family can stay

33:12.000 --> 33:13.300
While their son
is being treated-

33:13.300 --> 33:15.900
A kind of oasis away from
hospitals and doctors' offices.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.400
Is that pie in the sky?
Is it silly?

33:18.500 --> 33:20.100
-You mean here?
-No.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.900
Oh. Oh, it's a great idea.

33:22.900 --> 33:23.900
Really?

33:24.200 --> 33:26.200
Mom, that's fantastic.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.500
Let-Let ojal sponsor it.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.300
No.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.300
Oh, come on, it's the least i can do 00:33:30.7:after tonight's faux pas.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.600
I saved you from asking,
didn't i?

33:38.200 --> 33:40.400
Right. Thanks.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.600
I thought i was
doing a good thing.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
<i>You were doing
a practical thing.</i>

33:46.600 --> 33:47.800
Well, what's wrong with that?

33:47.800 --> 33:51.400
Kevin, for us,
domestic partnership is it-

33:51.500 --> 33:54.600
You know, our only legal option,
our version of marriage-

33:54.600 --> 33:56.200
For now, at least.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.300
And at the risk of sounding
like a 12-Year-Old girl...

34:01.400 --> 34:03.700
I want my wedding
to be special.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.300
"Practical" isn't enough
of a reason.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.600
So if and when i choose
to take that step,

34:08.600 --> 34:10.500
I want to stand up
in front of everyone i know

34:10.500 --> 34:11.800
And say

34:12.400 --> 34:14.699
"This is the man
i choose to be with

34:15.000 --> 34:18.500
Till i'm old and bald
and incontinent."

34:18.500 --> 34:19.699
Come here.

34:19.699 --> 34:21.100
It sounded far more romantic
in my head.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.000
It is romantic,

34:24.400 --> 34:28.400
I don't know if i'm ready for that or if
i ever will be.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.000
I'm not asking you to be.

34:30.000 --> 34:30.800
Are you upset?

34:30.800 --> 34:34.800
No. Kevin,
we're boyfriends, not clones.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.100
We can agree to disagree.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.800
Yeah,
i know, but you know us lawyers.We hate to lose arguments.

34:39.800 --> 34:40.900
Yeah, well, get used to it,

34:40.900 --> 34:43.100
Because this is not
an argument you're gonna win.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.000
Now i'm going
to brush and floss

34:45.000 --> 34:47.600
Because i don't have
dental insurance either.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
20-Year, single barrel.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Appropriate, don't you think?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.900
You know, before we drink,

34:56.500 --> 34:58.000
I just need
a little more clarification

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
On what my role would be.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.200
I take a bullet, you get a promotion.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.500
- That's the role.
- Come on, boyd.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.800
Well, as i said earlier,

35:03.800 --> 35:06.800
You'll be consulted
on every major decision.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.500
You know,
my first wife consulted me

35:10.500 --> 35:12.700
On every decision
building our house.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.800
No decision was too small-
What color to paint the kitchen,

35:17.800 --> 35:19.400
What the floor should be-

35:19.400 --> 35:21.500
Mahogany, oak, pine-

35:22.000 --> 35:23.700
And i'd give her my opinion.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.200
Then she'd turn right around and do whatever
the hell she wanted.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.800
Well,
my wife's the same way.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.700
Good thing i don't give a damn
about crown molding.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.000
But i do give a damn
about the country.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.100
So if i say yes,
i need your assurance

35:38.100 --> 35:40.600
That i will have a voice
in the administration.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.000
I said i'd hear you out.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.800
If you want me
to cross my heart on it-

35:45.800 --> 35:47.100
I don't appreciate
the condescension.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.000
And i don't appreciate you
trying to strong-Arm me.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
You're the one who offended
the moderates in the primary,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.900
And now you want to send me
out there to get us the votes.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.600
<i>So we're clear,
no one's voting for you.</i>

35:55.700 --> 35:57.400
That ship sailed
on super tuesday.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.800
They'll be voting for me.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.600
I am
unwilling to campaign for you

36:00.600 --> 36:03.800
For the next four months,
only to be shut out of every policy discussion.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.400
If you
say no to me, it'll be a mistake.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.200
The party???

36:09.200 --> 36:12.000
Will see you acting like
a little kid who lost,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.700
So you're taking your toys
and going home.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.300
I built a wide coalition.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.600
I bring a substantial amount
of delegates.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.400
I have a prime-Time speech
at the convention

36:20.400 --> 36:23.800
That i promise you i am going
to knock the living crap out of.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.900
My seat in the senate is safe.
I am 42 years old.

36:28.900 --> 36:32.300
So with all due respect,i'm a long way
from my curtain call.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.500
I'm offering you

36:33.500 --> 36:36.400
The second highest position
in our government.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.600
I suggest you take it.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.400
Hello, kitty.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.800
Well, hello, congressman.
Is everything okay?

36:49.800 --> 36:51.300
I'm just great.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.300
Your husband,
on the other hand,

36:53.400 --> 36:56.300
Just made the biggest mistake
of his political life.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.000
And a word to the wise-

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
If you had anything
to do with it, brace yourself.

37:01.100 --> 37:04.300
Oh, well, um,
appreciate the concern,

37:04.400 --> 37:05.800
But i think
we're gonna be fine.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.400
He's going to replay
our conversation in his mind...

37:09.500 --> 37:10.500
Over and over.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.000
He's gonna
second-Guess himself,

37:12.100 --> 37:14.200
Wonder what he could
have done differently.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.100
And eventually he's gonna have
to put all this blame somewhere,

37:18.100 --> 37:20.600
And it's going to be
the person closest to him.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.800
Well, see, that's actually
where you're wrong, congressman,

37:25.800 --> 37:29.800
Because unlike you,
robert is strong enough ???

37:30.300 --> 37:31.800
Without blaming anybody else.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.700
And yes, yes, i do share
my opinions with him,

37:34.700 --> 37:35.700
Because unlike your wife,

37:35.700 --> 37:38.700
<i>I am actually allowed
to have opinions.</i>

37:40.600 --> 37:42.200
Well, believe what you want,
kitty.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.400
But one day, he's going
to look at you

37:45.000 --> 37:47.200
And only see the woman
who stood between him

37:47.200 --> 37:49.100
And the white house.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.500
- Justin?
- I know it's early.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.600
Take this.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.400
No.It'll be early in like an hour.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.600
I don't know what
you'd call this.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.300
Don't be a wuss.
We're going to the beach.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.000
-Now?
- Yeah. You're a d.N.A.Tested and approved walker,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.600
Which means you have to learn how to
surf.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.800
Do sarah and kitty know how to surf?

38:27.800 --> 38:29.100
They-They've tried it once.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.100
They complained the entire time.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.200
Does it have to be this early?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.400
It sounded just like that.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.100
Fine,
i'll get my suit.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.800
Of course.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.700
-Sarah
- I am so glad you're both here...

38:46.700 --> 38:48.900
- Listen, we were just gonna call you. Because
- Now i can just say it, okay?

38:48.900 --> 38:49.700
Um, you're right.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.500
I obviously have trust issues
with the men in my life.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.200
Graham, i should have
come to you personally,

38:54.200 --> 38:57.100
Andi'm sorry if it appeared that i was jumping to
conclusions.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.600
- Look, sarah-
- Saul, no, let me say this.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.500
I know you wouldn't have done this deal had you
not done due diligence,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.200
And your instincts about ojal
have always been right on.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.200
So there it is. I just want
to say i'm here, i am on board.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.300
However, if either of you
ever go behind my back,

39:10.300 --> 39:12.200
I will have you shot.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.800
What's going on?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.600
Golden plum just filed
for bankruptcy.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.300
They were using, uh,
hedge fund money to expand,

39:22.300 --> 39:26.100
And i guess they, uh, they
really leveraged themselves,

39:26.100 --> 39:30.100
And the fund collapsed
this morning, and... that's it.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.500
They had no choice.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.400
We're still on the hook
for the ancillary deals.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.600
The bank's gonna
call in the loan.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.400
$20 million.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.500
We can't cover that.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.000
I know.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.400
We'll try again.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.700
We have time.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.000
You didn't turn down taylor
just because of me, did you?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.600
No, i turned taylor down
because of taylor.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.300
At the end of the day, i just couldn't
align myself with him.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.100
<i>I am not that ambitious.</i>

40:23.300 --> 40:24.800
You know, i really believe
that the country

40:24.800 --> 40:27.900
Will be a better place
with you in the white house,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.700
Whenever it happens.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.200
It's just that it's, um...

40:36.000 --> 40:38.500
It's just very hard
to share you with the entire country.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.400
T's just very hard
to share you with the entire country.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
And i don't want to lose you.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.800
I don't want to lose
what we have.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.300
I don't either.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.500
I just really thought
that this was...

40:55.900 --> 40:58.400
Gonna happen for us this time.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
It's not over.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.200
There'll be a next time.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.500
You gotta remember-
You want to get up

41:15.500 --> 41:16.900
And get your feet
under you at, like,

41:16.900 --> 41:19.000
- As quick as possible, okay?
- All right

41:19.000 --> 41:22.900
So we're paddling,
paddling, and... go!

41:24.100 --> 41:25.900
All right. There you go.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.500
Wow, you actually fall under
the, uh, coordinated side of the walker gene pool.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.000
-I think you're ready for water.
- Yeah?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.500
- You want to try it?
- Yeah, let's do it.

41:33.500 --> 41:37.200
All right. So let me just strap
on your little ankle thing here.

41:46.900 --> 41:47.700
That was weird for a minute,

41:47.700 --> 41:49.900
Thinking we might not
be related, right?

41:51.200 --> 41:52.800
Yep, that was weird.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.700
All right, you're gonna
love it, all right?

42:00.100 --> 42:02.000
You will never be the same.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
You're life's gonna be
changed forever.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.800
All right? Let's go.

42:07.800 --> 42:13.300
