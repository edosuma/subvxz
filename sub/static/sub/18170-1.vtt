00:48.000 --> 00:49.700
Somebody once said

00:49.700 --> 00:52.600
that religion was deemed
by the commoners as true,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.400
by the wise as false,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.899
and by the rulers as useful.

01:02.899 --> 01:04.599
The only thing I believe

01:04.699 --> 01:07.399
is that my name is Jonathan Preest.

01:07.499 --> 01:11.598
And tonight, I'm gonna kill a man.

02:29.394 --> 02:30.894
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:33.894 --> 02:35.694
What's going on? Where's Karen?

02:35.794 --> 02:37.794
A bit of a change of plan.

02:38.994 --> 02:42.093
Actually, quite a radical one.

02:42.293 --> 02:43.893
What?

02:46.493 --> 02:48.093
You're fucking kidding me?

02:48.093 --> 02:49.893
Seriously, I'm not.

02:50.093 --> 02:53.993
Let's just get back to London.
I think I need a drink.

03:02.993 --> 03:04.793
I think you make
too many demands on me.

03:06.193 --> 03:07.893
I feel we don't connect.

03:09.592 --> 03:11.092
That you...

03:11.892 --> 03:13.092
Sorry.

03:13.192 --> 03:16.192
...I hate you

03:16.392 --> 03:17.992
because of the divorce.

03:20.192 --> 03:24.291
Even though I've done everything to help you
support your so-called career...

03:24.391 --> 03:25.891
Margaret.

03:25.991 --> 03:27.891
Now, remember, remember the rules.

03:27.991 --> 03:31.891
Just what you feel Emilia thinks,
not what you think.

03:32.091 --> 03:33.991
I'm sorry.

03:34.391 --> 03:38.290
It's just that...
I really don't feel I'm getting through.

03:38.490 --> 03:40.590
That is the point ofthis, isn't it?

03:40.790 --> 03:42.590
Building trust takes time.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.890
All structure must start with foundation,

03:47.090 --> 03:49.589
and communication is
the cornerstone of foundation.

03:49.789 --> 03:50.789
Amen.

03:57.290 --> 03:58.390
Emilia.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.989
For fucking real?

04:03.189 --> 04:05.589
As real as you feel
you would express yourself

04:05.789 --> 04:07.789
if you were in your mother's shoes.

04:08.389 --> 04:09.489
Try.

04:09.589 --> 04:10.789
OK.

04:16.588 --> 04:20.288
The next time that you come back
from hospital after another...

04:20.488 --> 04:23.288
drunken suicide attempt, you little slut,

04:23.488 --> 04:25.488
I'll drag you home,

04:25.688 --> 04:28.888
throw your charity shop cast-offs
into a bin liner,

04:29.088 --> 04:31.787
and make you move
to some other stinking city.

04:31.987 --> 04:34.287
Any excuse to keep us away
from your dear father.

04:34.487 --> 04:36.887
- Don't you start...
- We can't even mention Father now!

04:37.087 --> 04:40.387
- That's enough!
- So we don't have to communicate...

04:40.587 --> 04:42.886
- Emilia!
- ... I'll provide my... my psychotic,

04:43.086 --> 04:45.686
alcoholic, waste-of-fucking-life
daughter...

04:45.786 --> 04:48.286
- Enough!
- ... with a Â£100-an-hour psychiatrist.

04:48.386 --> 04:52.087
- You see what I have to deal with?
- Make friends, find yourself a man...

04:52.187 --> 04:53.887
Emilia, will you be quiet?

04:55.887 --> 04:57.786
A little too much?

05:00.086 --> 05:02.186
Emilia, please.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.886
I need to speak with your mother.

05:07.186 --> 05:09.186
See you next Tuesday.

05:29.384 --> 05:31.284
- Hello?
- Hello. Anne?

05:31.384 --> 05:33.084
- Peter.
- Er, yes.

05:33.284 --> 05:34.484
You're there. Um...

05:34.684 --> 05:37.483
- I thought we agreed not to do this.
- Yes, but please, wait.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.983
But you promised me
you would not try to contact me.

05:40.183 --> 05:41.583
It's David.

05:41.783 --> 05:43.783
They're letting him do a day visit.

05:43.883 --> 05:46.484
- Yes, I heard.
- I'm picking him up on Wednesday.

05:48.184 --> 05:50.083
He can stay overnight as well.

05:51.483 --> 05:56.683
- Look, Peter, Martin will be home soon.
- Oh, Martin will understand. Ha!

05:56.783 --> 05:58.483
Will you come?

05:58.583 --> 06:01.483
- Peter...
- I'm sure he'd like to see his mother.

06:02.483 --> 06:04.082
Well, I'd like to see you, too.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.982
- It's been so long.
- I don't know.

06:07.982 --> 06:09.782
Look, I'll think about it.

06:09.882 --> 06:11.682
I've got to go now.

06:11.882 --> 06:13.082
Yes, OK.

06:13.182 --> 06:15.882
Don't read too much into this.

06:16.781 --> 06:18.881
I'll expect your call, then.

06:19.781 --> 06:20.981
Goodbye.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.281
Bye.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.780
So there it is.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.680
Meanwhile City.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.980
So beautiful from the upper heights...

06:53.180 --> 06:55.980
it almost looks like
it makes some kind of sense.

06:56.879 --> 07:01.079
From a distance, you'd neverthink
this city was hopelessly insane.

07:03.579 --> 07:04.879
It seems so long ago

07:05.079 --> 07:08.879
that the clockwork of events
that led me here began to turn.

07:09.079 --> 07:11.078
Events that led me to this room,

07:11.178 --> 07:13.878
to the task that I have to perform tonight -

07:14.078 --> 07:17.078
the eradication of The Individual.

07:20.378 --> 07:22.778
Back then, things seemed so simple.

07:22.978 --> 07:25.477
It seemed like any otherjob,

07:25.677 --> 07:28.077
any other night
on the streets downtown.

07:28.277 --> 07:31.777
The main drag
was swarming with the faithful.

07:58.576 --> 08:01.076
...open mind and a steadfast faith

08:01.176 --> 08:03.476
applies the unchanging values
of our religion

08:03.675 --> 08:06.375
to the new priorities
of the people of Meanwhile City.

08:06.475 --> 08:10.975
Our plan - to improve your lives,
to provide opportunity...

08:11.175 --> 08:15.175
We are all immortal, spiritual beings.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.874
I didn't like using
the main thoroughfares.

08:24.474 --> 08:26.775
The Ministry clerics
were always out in force.

08:27.775 --> 08:31.274
You see, you've got to have religion
to live in Meanwhile City.

08:33.474 --> 08:35.474
It's the law.

08:43.474 --> 08:46.473
There are now so many faiths
registered in this town,

08:46.673 --> 08:48.873
it gets kind of hard to be original.

08:48.973 --> 08:52.073
...find yourself clean on the outside...

08:52.173 --> 08:54.273
...the water has been drained.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.272
Objects such as coins,

08:57.472 --> 08:59.372
safety pins, stones,

08:59.572 --> 09:04.072
cause extensive damage
and must not be placed in the machine.

09:04.172 --> 09:06.072
These days,
you can form a congregation

09:06.272 --> 09:08.872
simply based
on washing-machine instructions.

09:09.972 --> 09:13.871
Always consult the care instructions
on the clothes.

09:22.972 --> 09:26.571
You see, without faith,
it's difficult to be controlled.

09:26.771 --> 09:28.971
And I didn't like being controlled.

09:29.171 --> 09:31.571
Not by anybody.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.871
That made me a big problem
for the Ministry.

09:34.071 --> 09:36.271
I'm the one and only non-believer

09:36.471 --> 09:38.070
in Meanwhile City.

09:42.470 --> 09:45.870
I'd been investigating a nasty little faith
known as Duplex Ride.

09:46.070 --> 09:49.870
Their leader called himself
The Individual.

09:49.970 --> 09:53.269
He was one of the most dangerous
I'd come across.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.869
Egocentric and insanely deluded.

10:00.769 --> 10:03.869
The Individual had abducted a young girl
into Duplex Ride.

10:05.068 --> 10:06.668
For what purpose?

10:06.768 --> 10:08.668
Somebody's god only knew.

10:12.668 --> 10:14.069
God bless you.

10:16.069 --> 10:17.668
How's tricks?

10:19.268 --> 10:21.068
Whisky, please.

10:21.168 --> 10:23.368
- Straight.
- Coming up.

10:25.868 --> 10:27.868
Hot outside today.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.267
He here?

10:37.167 --> 10:39.267
You're sure you wanna stay
for this drink?

10:39.367 --> 10:40.667
Think I shouldn't?

10:40.767 --> 10:42.567
He's in the back.

10:51.566 --> 10:53.166
- Thanks.
- No problem.

10:54.366 --> 10:55.866
Your god bless you.

10:58.465 --> 11:02.365
Wormsnakes -
my eyes and ears on the street.

11:02.565 --> 11:03.965
Ha, ha!

11:04.165 --> 11:05.465
Mr Preest!

11:06.765 --> 11:08.266
Looking...

11:08.466 --> 11:10.166
You're looking well.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.565
You know how I feel
about public appearances.

11:12.765 --> 11:14.665
Just tell me what you got.

11:14.865 --> 11:18.465
Mr Preest, information...
is very hard to come by these days,

11:18.665 --> 11:21.765
let alone having any faith in it,
you know what I mean?

11:21.965 --> 11:23.365
Snakes,

11:23.565 --> 11:25.364
I'm running out of patience.

11:25.564 --> 11:27.564
You don't understand!

11:29.164 --> 11:31.564
If he finds out that I...

11:31.664 --> 11:34.864
It'll be nothing to what
I'll do if you don't.

11:35.064 --> 11:36.564
The girl, Snakes!

11:36.764 --> 11:38.363
Where is she?

11:39.163 --> 11:41.363
The girl, she's dead.

11:42.363 --> 11:44.363
- Please!
- The Individual?

11:44.563 --> 11:46.863
I don't know! I swear, I don't know!

11:46.963 --> 11:50.363
- Did he do it himself?
- I don't know the... the d- d- details.

11:50.563 --> 11:54.162
You know, she didn't... didn't suffer.
That's all I know.

11:54.362 --> 11:57.962
- Just tell me where he is.
- I don't know! I swear!

11:58.062 --> 12:01.563
All I know is that you should
get out of here before they...

12:01.763 --> 12:03.863
Before what?

12:04.063 --> 12:05.862
Ssh! They made me.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.762
No! No!

12:12.062 --> 12:13.962
I'll be back for you.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.260
Too many clerics on the street.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.460
I should have seen the signs.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.060
Stupid.

12:47.659 --> 12:50.359
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

12:52.759 --> 12:54.659
Are you sure?

12:54.759 --> 12:57.360
I mean, you guys have been
down this road before.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.959
That's just it.
Maybe I should have seen it coming.

13:01.559 --> 13:04.759
Does being jilted at the altar count
when it's your rehearsal day?

13:04.959 --> 13:06.059
Milo.

13:06.159 --> 13:07.159
Come on.

13:07.359 --> 13:09.059
Just a thought.

13:10.559 --> 13:12.658
There's so many people to call.

13:13.558 --> 13:15.358
Do you think she's spoken to anyone?

13:15.558 --> 13:18.158
That's the last thing
you should be thinking about.

13:20.158 --> 13:22.358
It's hard enough
bloody organising a wedding.

13:22.558 --> 13:24.758
How the fuck do you go about
dismantling one?

13:24.858 --> 13:27.657
- They don't tell you that, do they?
- Just relax.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.557
I'll take care of everything.

13:30.557 --> 13:32.357
I'm still your best man, OK?

13:32.457 --> 13:34.157
It's my duty, right?

13:41.356 --> 13:43.056
Do you need to stay tonight?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.156
No, I'll probablyjust head back to mine.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.956
All right, just thought
you might like the company.

13:54.856 --> 13:56.756
Mate.

15:09.352 --> 15:12.451
This is Emilia. Leave a message.

15:13.551 --> 15:15.251
Emilia? Hello?

15:15.351 --> 15:18.351
Er, Emilia,
it's Gavin Clunes from college.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.351
I've not seen you in for a while.

15:20.551 --> 15:23.751
I don't need to remind you
that your deadline was Thursday.

15:23.951 --> 15:25.751
Call me back if you can.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.850
She was lost, needed my help.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.950
And I'd let her down.

15:36.150 --> 15:39.350
A routine cultjob,

15:39.550 --> 15:42.150
and now the girl I was supposed to save
was dead.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.550
The Individual had gone to ground

15:44.750 --> 15:47.450
and Wormsnakes had given me up
to the Ministry.

15:56.749 --> 15:58.849
I knew I was a wanted man.

15:59.049 --> 16:01.349
But even I hadn't expected
that much attention.

16:41.947 --> 16:44.747
Well, let's see what all the fuss is about.

16:47.146 --> 16:50.646
Somebody upstairs had wanted me
brought in. And whoeverthey were...

16:52.346 --> 16:54.546
...they were good.

17:04.744 --> 17:06.244
Shit.

17:18.344 --> 17:21.344
Anywhere can feel like a prison
when you don't have any faith.

17:31.444 --> 17:34.244
The only thing that got me through
the endless night...

17:35.244 --> 17:36.944
...was to plan,

17:37.044 --> 17:38.844
stay focused...

17:40.743 --> 17:42.243
...stay sane.

17:47.543 --> 17:49.143
Then, out of nowhere,

17:49.243 --> 17:50.943
they came.

18:04.942 --> 18:06.642
Slowly now...

18:06.841 --> 18:08.341
Get up.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.041
Tarrant.

18:33.041 --> 18:36.040
The nearest I ever got
to the face behind the curtain.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
Nice to see you again, John.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.340
Yesterday, we received word

18:42.540 --> 18:45.440
that one of our stations in the South City
had been hit.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.339
Chemical attack of some kind.

18:49.139 --> 18:50.439
All operatives lost,

18:50.639 --> 18:53.539
as well as any hope of monitoring
the southern wall.

18:54.539 --> 18:56.239
It wasn't me.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.239
Quite.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.538
However, we do know who it was.

19:02.738 --> 19:05.938
Consequently, we have a proposition
to put to you...

19:06.938 --> 19:11.238
You lock me up for four years and now,
all of a sudden, you want to...

19:11.438 --> 19:12.839
Offer you a job.

19:13.039 --> 19:14.238
Interested?

19:14.438 --> 19:16.738
What could possibly interest me?

19:16.938 --> 19:18.438
Freedom, perhaps.

19:18.538 --> 19:21.438
The chance to settle an old score.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.038
Familiar faces have been turning up
in Meanwhile City,

19:27.137 --> 19:31.237
every one of them a fully-fledged,
paid-up member of...

19:32.037 --> 19:34.037
...Duplex Ride.

19:35.437 --> 19:36.837
That's right.

19:37.037 --> 19:39.837
The nasty little religion
that murdered your last client.

19:46.736 --> 19:49.636
"Life through the eyes
of the sole beholder.

19:49.736 --> 19:53.436
The world around him tailored
and designed for the one and only... "

19:53.636 --> 19:56.035
- The Individual.
- That's right.

19:56.135 --> 19:59.135
Seems like your old nemesis
is finally coming home to roost.

19:59.235 --> 20:01.735
We want to give you
a chance to make amends.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.535
For what?

20:04.435 --> 20:06.636
You're a man without religion, John,

20:06.736 --> 20:08.635
a man without direction.

20:09.635 --> 20:12.235
We want you to come to peace
with your inner self,

20:12.335 --> 20:15.335
embrace a belief, however small.

20:17.635 --> 20:19.435
How old was she, John?

20:20.335 --> 20:23.134
How old was the little girl
you failed to save?

20:23.334 --> 20:25.434
10? 11?

20:27.534 --> 20:28.934
Count yourself lucky

20:29.134 --> 20:32.834
that absolution is very much part
ofthis religion's dogma.

20:33.034 --> 20:35.933
The Individual is coming back
to Meanwhile City.

20:37.133 --> 20:38.133
So?

20:38.333 --> 20:41.233
Well, you'll be doing us all a service.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.033
You'll have the Ministry's permission,

20:44.133 --> 20:45.933
sectarian permission,

20:46.033 --> 20:48.032
to commit this sin.

20:48.232 --> 20:50.432
Can I assume you're going to cooperate?

20:54.832 --> 20:56.832
So what happens now?

20:56.932 --> 20:59.132
Good. No time like the present.

20:59.332 --> 21:02.932
Take him to the hospital,
get him dressed and field ready, please.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.732
Oh, and, John...

21:06.932 --> 21:09.732
You'll probably be needing this.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.524
She went out the back.

23:16.824 --> 23:18.824
You won't see her today.

23:19.624 --> 23:21.524
"Her"?

24:25.020 --> 24:28.520
My name is Emilia Bryant.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.520
And I'm a liar.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.520
Drowning in depression

24:33.720 --> 24:36.520
at the bottomless lake
of my fathomless mind,

24:36.620 --> 24:38.620
a mind that's lost its heart.

24:40.220 --> 24:41.720
Disappointing, isn't it?

24:44.520 --> 24:46.820
Come closer, beautiful girl.

24:47.020 --> 24:49.619
I want to fall into the depth of your eyes,

24:49.819 --> 24:53.519
kiss your lips as red as blood.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.919
We understand one another.

25:07.918 --> 25:10.818
Emergency services.
Which service do you require?

25:11.018 --> 25:12.218
Ambulance.

25:12.418 --> 25:15.518
74 Leonard Street, London EC2.

25:15.717 --> 25:16.817
Flat 3.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.717
OK. Can you tell me
what the problem is there?

25:20.817 --> 25:23.717
Suicide attempt. Hurry.

26:09.414 --> 26:12.214
Next stop, Meanwhile City Hospital.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.114
Not many people left this place
in better shape than they arrived.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.214
I knew why I was there.

26:19.414 --> 26:22.014
And I was running out oftime.

26:31.414 --> 26:32.614
Here.

26:33.814 --> 26:35.114
Get in!

26:42.613 --> 26:44.413
Oh, hello, dear.

26:46.413 --> 26:50.612
As Mr Tarrant probably explained,
we want to fix you up with a homing device.

26:50.812 --> 26:54.212
We don't want to lose track of you
on the streets, now, do we?

26:54.312 --> 26:56.912
Well, funnily enough,
he didn't mention it.

26:57.112 --> 26:59.812
I thought this was just a medical.

27:00.012 --> 27:01.412
Just a precaution.

27:01.512 --> 27:04.511
If you pop yourself on this chair,
I think we can do it with a local.

27:06.211 --> 27:08.111
Regulation for all clerics in the field.

27:10.211 --> 27:13.811
Come, now.
Not scared of a little procedure, are we?

28:03.108 --> 28:07.108
I needed to go to ground,
hit the safe house and make ready.

28:08.908 --> 28:11.408
I'd always intended
on dealing with The Individual

28:11.508 --> 28:13.708
in my own way.

28:23.507 --> 28:25.407
How long since the call?

28:25.607 --> 28:28.907
- 14, 15 minutes.
- Come on, love. Wake up now!

28:35.007 --> 28:37.006
Give her some oxygen.

28:41.706 --> 28:43.606
Who is she?

28:43.806 --> 28:47.606
Name - Emilia Bryant.
Next of kin - Margaret Bryant. Blood type A.

28:47.606 --> 28:49.806
Emilia, come on, wake up now.

28:50.005 --> 28:51.705
Wake up, love.

28:51.805 --> 28:53.005
Emilia?

28:53.205 --> 28:55.005
Emilia, can you hear me?

28:57.505 --> 28:59.305
Let's move her.

29:00.305 --> 29:03.105
OK, Steve, prep Thomas's.
Tell them we've got an OD.

29:03.305 --> 29:05.705
One, two, three...

29:31.503 --> 29:34.603
Young female, mid-twenties,
found unconscious on her bed.

29:34.803 --> 29:38.503
Left a suicide note, by the looks of it.
All the details are there for us.

29:38.603 --> 29:40.403
Baseline obs look pretty good.

29:40.603 --> 29:43.602
- But otherwise not much response.
- OK, one minute.

29:44.602 --> 29:47.002
- One minute.
- Put her in room six.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.102
- Are you OK?
- It's been a crazy week.

29:52.902 --> 29:54.302
Number six again.

30:05.502 --> 30:08.202
Today on Radio 4 with
John Humphreys and Edward Stone.

30:08.402 --> 30:10.401
Hello?

30:11.401 --> 30:12.601
Yes?

30:14.701 --> 30:16.201
Oh, yes?

30:19.801 --> 30:21.301
Oh, my God.

30:23.201 --> 30:25.500
No, no, no, he hasn't been here.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.600
What do you mean,
has he contacted me? Where is he?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.800
Um... yes.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.299
Well, you'll... you'll call me back.
You'll call me back when?

30:39.199 --> 30:40.499
Well...

30:40.599 --> 30:42.599
Well, of course.

30:47.599 --> 30:49.899
Yes. Yes, I will.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.799
I'm very sorry. Goodbye.

33:28.890 --> 33:30.590
No, I'm sorry.

33:33.089 --> 33:35.690
I tell you what,
these are the last names...

33:53.789 --> 33:55.389
Did you call my mother?

33:55.489 --> 33:56.589
Hm?

33:58.488 --> 34:00.288
Did you call my mother?

34:00.488 --> 34:01.788
Yes.

34:01.888 --> 34:03.788
The staff nurse spoke to her.

34:06.088 --> 34:08.188
Let me guess.

34:08.388 --> 34:10.288
She wanted to know if you were OK.

34:11.887 --> 34:13.587
But not enough to come down here.

34:13.786 --> 34:14.887
Right?

34:30.987 --> 34:32.387
I'm sorry.

34:32.587 --> 34:34.987
- Would you like me to...?
- No, no, no.

34:35.187 --> 34:37.587
That's all right. Please carry on.

34:41.886 --> 34:44.186
I look after a church myself.

34:45.485 --> 34:46.985
I'm a warden.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.886
Back in Cambridge.

34:55.685 --> 34:57.685
It never stops, does it?

34:58.785 --> 35:00.385
It's the same.

35:02.885 --> 35:03.885
Actually...

35:04.885 --> 35:06.884
I'm here looking for somebody.

35:08.284 --> 35:09.984
My son.

35:10.084 --> 35:11.684
Would you...?

35:15.884 --> 35:17.284
I don't know.

35:17.484 --> 35:19.583
I see so many here. Every day.

35:19.783 --> 35:21.383
I can imagine.

35:27.284 --> 35:28.184
What?

35:28.284 --> 35:29.684
What is it?

35:29.784 --> 35:31.284
He is lost.

35:32.683 --> 35:33.983
Yes, he is.

35:34.183 --> 35:36.183
That's why I'm looking for him.

35:41.183 --> 35:42.583
Could I...?

35:43.983 --> 35:44.983
Please.

35:47.282 --> 35:48.782
I'm sorry.

35:48.882 --> 35:50.882
I haven't seen this person.

35:52.482 --> 35:54.482
That's all right. Thank you, anyway.

36:03.981 --> 36:05.581
If you needed to find someone,

36:05.781 --> 36:08.981
the best place to start
was the Faith Registration Centre -

36:10.081 --> 36:12.280
Meanwhile's melting pot of the pious.

36:17.281 --> 36:19.781
Every creed, cult, religion and doctrine

36:19.981 --> 36:21.481
pass through these doors,

36:21.681 --> 36:24.681
all looking for the same sense
of belonging and hope.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.180
I just hoped that Wormsnakes
had managed to hold onto his job.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
Next!

36:44.479 --> 36:45.679
He's in there.

36:50.079 --> 36:51.979
Nothing had changed.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.478
This was still a living,
breathing testament to the insanity

36:55.678 --> 36:57.378
of the Ministry's grip on this city.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.978
Please be advised that queue-jumping...

37:04.178 --> 37:09.778
A free blessing
for every donation we receive.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.278
Hi, I'm Teri. How can I help?

37:12.378 --> 37:14.878
I'm looking for somebody
who works in the kitchen.

37:14.978 --> 37:17.778
Oh, OK. I just need you
to enter your faith for the record.

37:17.978 --> 37:19.777
- Why?
- For the register.

37:19.977 --> 37:21.577
What's your faith?

37:21.777 --> 37:23.177
What's yours?

37:23.277 --> 37:27.577
Well, at the moment, I'm with
some Seventh Day Manicurists.

37:29.177 --> 37:30.577
But I'm thinking of changing.

37:30.777 --> 37:34.276
The level of discussion isn't great
and we've nearly run out of colours.

37:35.176 --> 37:37.876
It's probably not your thing.
If you just want to sign in.

37:38.976 --> 37:41.376
Thank you. I've seen all I need to see.

37:41.576 --> 37:43.476
OK. Don't mention it and God bless you.

37:45.876 --> 37:47.875
Hi, I'm Teri. How can I help?

38:08.975 --> 38:10.975
You're not allowed to smoke in here.

38:13.274 --> 38:15.274
Do you think?

38:19.274 --> 38:21.274
I saw you come in. Last night.

38:22.974 --> 38:24.774
May I talk to you for a moment?

38:24.974 --> 38:26.373
I can...

38:27.473 --> 38:29.473
...buy you a hot drink.

38:31.473 --> 38:32.473
Please.

38:41.072 --> 38:43.072
We get many suicides.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.072
Oh.

38:48.372 --> 38:50.372
I heard the paramedics talking.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.371
So you know the whole story.

38:54.371 --> 38:56.671
My name is Pastor Bone.

38:56.771 --> 38:59.572
It means "bread of life".

38:59.672 --> 39:01.572
Look, Mr... whoever you are,

39:01.772 --> 39:04.072
- I appreciate...
- I knew someone once.

39:06.372 --> 39:09.871
She did what you tried to do last night.

39:11.171 --> 39:13.171
She was... successful.

39:14.271 --> 39:16.171
She started a chain of events like...

39:16.271 --> 39:17.371
dominoes.

39:17.571 --> 39:19.271
I'm sorry, but I really should...

39:19.471 --> 39:22.870
I'm just saying that it isn'tjust about
your family, your friends,

39:23.070 --> 39:24.570
the people you leave behind.

39:24.670 --> 39:27.470
It's about the people you haven't met yet.

39:30.970 --> 39:33.270
A person can stay inside themselves
for too long

39:33.369 --> 39:37.169
and end up blind, like not recognising
your own voice on tape or...

39:37.369 --> 39:38.969
It's an art project.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.269
- I'm sorry. I...
- Listen.

39:43.469 --> 39:44.369
I...

39:44.469 --> 39:46.669
I get to piss off my mother
and my tutors.

39:46.868 --> 39:49.468
I get to kill myself every month
without dying.

39:49.568 --> 39:51.269
I'm having a ball.

39:51.469 --> 39:52.669
OK?

39:56.469 --> 39:58.469
You know what, Mr Bone?

39:59.869 --> 40:02.668
You should get yourself a job
as a social worker here.

40:06.468 --> 40:07.568
Thank you.

40:07.768 --> 40:09.368
For the coffee.

40:37.366 --> 40:40.066
I followed Wormsnakes home
after his shift.

40:40.266 --> 40:43.865
Snakes' neighbourhood suited
his personality down to a T.

40:44.765 --> 40:46.266
Fractured. Infected.

40:46.466 --> 40:47.666
Forgotten.

40:48.666 --> 40:50.666
Meanwhile's slum quarter.

41:15.664 --> 41:16.664
Jesus Christ!

41:16.864 --> 41:18.664
Wormsnakes.

41:20.164 --> 41:22.163
Get the fuck out of my apartment now!

41:23.263 --> 41:25.063
Let's not make this difficult.

41:26.163 --> 41:28.063
What do you want from me?

41:28.263 --> 41:29.963
What do you want?

41:32.663 --> 41:34.262
You're crazy. Know that, yeah?

41:37.762 --> 41:39.763
Be polite. You owe me, remember?

41:39.963 --> 41:43.163
For every single day of my four years.

41:43.363 --> 41:44.963
My fucking nose!

41:46.663 --> 41:50.862
Now, then, the word on the street is
The Individual is coming to town.

41:51.962 --> 41:55.162
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, now, would you?

41:55.362 --> 41:56.962
No! No! I swear.

41:57.662 --> 41:59.162
Uhh...

42:00.162 --> 42:02.061
I don't believe you.

42:03.561 --> 42:05.661
I need you to do a little favour for me.

42:08.961 --> 42:12.061
I want you to tell The Individual
where he can find me.

42:12.261 --> 42:13.361
How do you know...

42:13.561 --> 42:15.460
How do you know he is gonna come
and find me?

42:15.560 --> 42:17.160
I found you, didn't I?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.960
I'm gonna be at this address.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.360
And rest assured, he'll find you.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.560
Just do yourjob.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.559
What little faith I have...

42:29.559 --> 42:31.259
...I have it in you.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.360
You're a lucky man, Snakes.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.760
You've got a stay of execution.

42:41.759 --> 42:43.059
Understand?

42:44.259 --> 42:46.259
I'll be waiting and watching.

42:49.259 --> 42:50.959
Nice to see you again.

42:52.959 --> 42:54.858
Fucking likewise, I'm sure.

42:54.958 --> 42:57.958
I knew he'd deliver my message
one way or another.

42:59.458 --> 43:01.058
Now all I had to do...

43:01.258 --> 43:02.658
was wait.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.957
So another in a long line of relationships
bites the dust.

43:08.957 --> 43:13.357
And after all this... experience,
the same thing happening again and again,

43:13.457 --> 43:15.357
I understand it all even less.

43:15.557 --> 43:16.857
Cheers.

43:17.057 --> 43:19.257
- Cheers.
- Hey. Hey. What did I say?

43:22.156 --> 43:25.256
- Spoilsport.
- Whatever the subject, let's change it.

43:26.356 --> 43:27.857
How about this?

43:28.857 --> 43:30.657
I think I saw Sally again.

43:30.857 --> 43:32.157
Yesterday.

43:32.357 --> 43:36.556
This again? Technically, that's not really
changing the subject, is it?

43:36.656 --> 43:39.356
- Who's Sally?
- Milo's childhood sweetheart.

43:40.356 --> 43:42.756
I think I saw her
around a couple of months ago.

43:42.956 --> 43:45.156
It felt like she was following me
or something.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.556
This time, it was closer.
I'm sure it was her.

43:47.756 --> 43:50.455
- Childhood sweetheart?
- When I was about seven.

43:50.555 --> 43:51.955
See what I mean?

43:52.155 --> 43:54.655
I think that's lovely.
See? Romance is not dead.

43:54.755 --> 43:57.055
Come on.
Enough of the romantic bullshit.

43:57.255 --> 44:00.155
- Thank you very much.
- Do you see what you're doing to me?

44:01.055 --> 44:03.054
Oh...

44:29.653 --> 44:33.453
I heard this story once
when I was a kid, or read it.

44:33.553 --> 44:35.253
It was about a storyteller

44:35.353 --> 44:40.153
who was so good at telling stories
that everything he made up became real.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.352
Which would be an awesome superpower.

44:42.452 --> 44:44.452
Exactly.

44:44.652 --> 44:47.252
So the storyteller creates
a world for himself

44:47.452 --> 44:51.052
where he's the king of the castle,
has a beautiful princess on his arm.

44:51.252 --> 44:53.952
- The sun's-always-shining kind of stuff.
- Yeah?

44:56.151 --> 44:58.151
And then, one day, he wakes up.

44:59.551 --> 45:00.951
He looks around.

45:01.151 --> 45:03.151
He kisses her on the cheek and...

45:04.251 --> 45:05.551
...legs it.

45:05.751 --> 45:06.951
Why?

45:07.851 --> 45:09.350
I don't know.

45:10.650 --> 45:13.650
Even though his life was perfect,
absolutely perfect,

45:13.750 --> 45:16.351
he had the feeling he should be
somewhere else.

45:16.551 --> 45:18.351
With someone else.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.650
Anyway, the princess wakes up
and he's gone.

45:24.650 --> 45:26.650
And that's it. I guess.

45:27.650 --> 45:29.750
Does that make any sense?

45:33.850 --> 45:34.950
No.

45:35.849 --> 45:37.849
I'm going to open another bottle.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.447
I take it that's how it ends.

46:26.247 --> 46:28.347
It ends when you want
to stop watching it.

46:28.547 --> 46:30.346
Well, that happens to be right now.

46:41.046 --> 46:42.345
That was real.

46:42.445 --> 46:43.745
Define "real".

46:43.945 --> 46:45.845
You called the ambulance.

46:46.045 --> 46:48.345
I had to. I'd have died, otherwise.

46:48.545 --> 46:50.745
I can't let you submit this, Emilia.

46:50.945 --> 46:52.845
- You know that.
- You're censoring me?

46:52.945 --> 46:55.145
This is way more extreme
than the last one.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.744
It's not finished.

46:58.344 --> 47:00.644
What happened
to your Following project?

47:00.844 --> 47:05.145
Two months following random strangers
around London with your video camera.

47:05.345 --> 47:08.645
- Now you're going to throw it all away?
- The last guy saw me.

47:09.744 --> 47:13.544
I even wore a wig to disguise myself
for a few days, but it didn't work.

47:15.044 --> 47:16.344
It's over.

47:16.544 --> 47:18.044
So is this.

47:23.143 --> 47:26.143
I suggest you stop wasting
the emergency services' time.

47:26.343 --> 47:29.243
- Come up with something more original.
- More original?

47:29.343 --> 47:33.343
Shock and bad taste doesn't necessarily
equate with originality.

47:33.543 --> 47:36.542
Like I said, it's not finished.

47:36.742 --> 47:38.742
And how does it finish, Emilia?

47:39.742 --> 47:41.042
With you dead?

47:41.142 --> 47:42.742
The college sued?

47:46.142 --> 47:47.642
I don't know.

47:48.642 --> 47:50.241
Well, I bloody well do.

47:50.941 --> 47:52.441
Bin this drivel.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.141
Get back on track.

47:54.341 --> 47:56.342
Or don't bother coming back.

48:19.740 --> 48:22.840
When you're lost,
you're willing to believe anything.

48:23.840 --> 48:28.340
In this city, every religion promised a
future, whether in this world or the next.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.139
All you had to pay them with
was your faith and trust

48:32.339 --> 48:35.639
and, despite the celebration,
the reverence and the prayer,

48:35.739 --> 48:38.239
everybody ends up
in the same human mess.

48:38.439 --> 48:39.439
Old.

48:39.639 --> 48:40.739
Sick.

48:40.939 --> 48:42.039
Unhappy.

48:42.139 --> 48:43.338
Dead.

48:45.838 --> 48:47.338
She'd be 16 now.

48:47.438 --> 48:48.938
A young woman.

48:49.138 --> 48:51.039
The Individual had robbed her of life

48:51.239 --> 48:52.539
and, tonight,

48:52.739 --> 48:54.939
I was going to relieve him of his.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.633
You asked me how this finished.

50:22.833 --> 50:24.333
I told the truth.

50:24.533 --> 50:26.133
I don't know.

50:27.633 --> 50:29.533
A broken doll.

50:29.733 --> 50:31.232
A hollow girl.

50:31.332 --> 50:33.332
Bereft at the loss of herfather.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.432
But part of me left when he did.

50:40.333 --> 50:43.732
Someone said, "It's about the people
you haven't met yet. "

50:44.632 --> 50:46.432
Like the people on my tapes.

50:47.432 --> 50:49.432
I'm not sure I like the sound of them.

50:51.432 --> 50:52.732
The truth is...

50:52.932 --> 50:55.032
I'm a little scared they might be like me.

50:58.231 --> 50:59.831
I'm sorry, Mr Clunes.

51:00.031 --> 51:02.031
That's the best I can do.

51:26.629 --> 51:28.229
Get me down!

51:46.029 --> 51:47.029
Hello.

51:48.129 --> 51:49.729
I was just... um...

51:50.728 --> 51:52.128
- Passing?
- Yeah.

51:53.128 --> 51:54.628
Sally.

51:54.828 --> 51:55.928
Wow.

51:56.128 --> 51:57.828
It must have been...

51:57.928 --> 51:59.928
- 20 years.
- 20 years, yeah.

52:00.128 --> 52:03.128
But... I saw you on the street
the other day.

52:03.228 --> 52:04.427
Oh.

52:05.227 --> 52:07.127
At least... I thought it was you.

52:07.327 --> 52:09.127
I got to thinking about you.

52:09.927 --> 52:11.527
Quite a lot, I guess.

52:12.527 --> 52:15.827
I just came to check the records.
I never thought you'd be working here.

52:16.827 --> 52:18.426
Check the records?

52:20.526 --> 52:23.226
Yeah, well, you know,
so I could try and contact you,

52:23.426 --> 52:25.326
write to you or something.

52:25.527 --> 52:27.827
Do you get a lunch hour?

52:29.127 --> 52:31.226
Can you spare a few minutes?

52:44.925 --> 52:46.325
Excuse me.

52:46.525 --> 52:48.825
Sorry. We're not really open yet.

52:49.025 --> 52:50.525
Er, yes, I know.

52:50.725 --> 52:52.125
I'm sorry, but...

52:52.325 --> 52:54.625
I was wondering if you could help me.

52:54.725 --> 52:56.725
I'm looking for someone.

52:59.924 --> 53:01.324
It's my son, you see.

53:02.024 --> 53:04.324
He used to come here
a few years ago and I...

53:04.524 --> 53:06.424
I just wondered if he'd been back.

53:06.524 --> 53:09.024
OK. Well, do you have a picture?
I can put it on the board.

53:09.224 --> 53:10.923
I do, actually.

53:11.023 --> 53:12.423
Erm...

53:12.623 --> 53:14.023
well, I only have this one.

53:14.223 --> 53:16.023
- It's OK. I can do a copy.
- Thank you.

53:21.324 --> 53:23.224
Do you recognise him?

53:23.324 --> 53:25.223
I don't know. Maybe.

53:26.223 --> 53:29.723
I couldn't say for sure.
He probably doesn't look like this any more.

53:31.723 --> 53:33.323
No, of course not.

53:35.123 --> 53:36.823
Look, I'm only part time.

53:37.623 --> 53:40.622
You could speak to Bill. He's been
here the longest. He'll be in later.

53:40.822 --> 53:42.322
Bill Wasnik.

53:43.422 --> 53:45.722
Why don't you
put your contact details on there?

53:45.922 --> 53:47.422
- Oh, yes.
- Do you have a pen?

53:47.622 --> 53:49.222
I do. Yes. Thank you.

53:58.321 --> 53:59.621
Great.

53:59.821 --> 54:01.321
Thanks.

54:32.419 --> 54:34.319
So when did you start teaching?

54:34.419 --> 54:36.019
- Pretty recently.
- Yeah?

54:37.919 --> 54:39.419
Suits you.

54:39.619 --> 54:40.919
Thank you.

54:41.019 --> 54:43.119
You look good with kids.

54:43.219 --> 54:45.218
You were always good with me.

54:46.318 --> 54:49.518
I know we were both kids at the time,
but you know what I mean.

54:49.718 --> 54:51.218
Yeah, I think so.

54:54.518 --> 54:56.018
How is your mum?

54:56.218 --> 54:57.018
OK.

54:57.218 --> 54:58.717
Still the same.

54:58.817 --> 55:00.617
Away with the fairies.

55:05.517 --> 55:07.518
When did you forget about me?

55:22.517 --> 55:23.617
- Hello.
- Anne.

55:23.817 --> 55:28.016
If you want to leave a message for Anne
or Martin, please speak afterthe tone.

55:39.415 --> 55:41.215
Well, I should get back.

55:42.215 --> 55:43.815
It's been really nice.

55:44.015 --> 55:45.915
Could I... see you again?

55:46.015 --> 55:47.115
Milo...

55:47.315 --> 55:49.215
We could go for a drink or something.

55:49.315 --> 55:53.314
- It's been so long, it's bizarre
luck you... - Yeah, but it's fate.

55:53.514 --> 55:56.114
Thought you didn't
believe in all that stuff.

55:56.314 --> 55:58.414
Look... I'm not taking no for an answer.

55:58.614 --> 56:00.514
Any time at all. Any day this week.

56:00.614 --> 56:01.915
OK. OK.

56:02.115 --> 56:03.815
How about Friday?

56:04.015 --> 56:05.814
- Friday.
- All right.

56:06.014 --> 56:07.914
There's a... There's a restaurant.

56:08.014 --> 56:10.314
The Tabernacle.
On the corner of Lennox Street.

56:10.514 --> 56:12.514
- Yeah. I know it.
- Yeah?

56:12.714 --> 56:13.914
Eight?

56:14.114 --> 56:15.714
OK. I'll be there.

56:15.814 --> 56:17.714
Can I get your number?

56:17.814 --> 56:20.013
Everything OK? Can I help?

56:20.113 --> 56:22.113
No, it's fine, thanks. We're fine.

56:22.213 --> 56:24.413
- Don't expect too much.
- I won't.

56:24.613 --> 56:25.513
Friday.

56:38.712 --> 56:40.312
Her name was Sarah

56:40.412 --> 56:42.412
and she was only 11 years old.

56:43.612 --> 56:46.011
To The Individual and his twisted faith,

56:46.211 --> 56:48.311
she was just another soul sacrificed

56:48.411 --> 56:51.511
and forgotten in the detritus
ofthis senseless world.

56:53.111 --> 56:57.212
One little soul,
who is now about to be avenged.

57:03.611 --> 57:07.311
I had to keep it together, stay focused.

57:08.911 --> 57:10.611
It's nearly time.

57:15.910 --> 57:17.210
Hi, Mum.

57:21.310 --> 57:23.410
You could have come sooner, you know.

57:24.610 --> 57:27.509
Might have seemed
a little bit too much like running away.

57:29.509 --> 57:32.109
Coming home is never like running away.

57:33.809 --> 57:35.609
What's happening with the flat?

57:35.809 --> 57:37.909
I might keep hold of it for a while longer,

57:38.109 --> 57:41.508
but I'll probably spend a couple of nights
at Dan and Laura's.

57:41.608 --> 57:43.308
How is young Dan?

57:43.508 --> 57:48.308
A little embarrassed at his abject failure
as best man. Other than that, he's OK.

57:48.408 --> 57:49.309
Bless.

57:49.509 --> 57:51.209
It wasn't his fault.

57:55.008 --> 57:57.008
I think you've had a lucky escape.

58:31.906 --> 58:33.705
Bring her over here, please.

58:34.705 --> 58:36.705
She's bicardic.

58:37.505 --> 58:38.905
Get me some atropine.

58:48.005 --> 58:49.605
We're losing her.

59:07.304 --> 59:09.104
Er... Bill Wasnik?

59:11.004 --> 59:12.204
Yeah.

59:13.203 --> 59:15.303
Something kind of funny
has happened, though.

59:15.503 --> 59:17.003
Oh?

59:17.203 --> 59:18.903
I bumped into an old flame.

59:19.103 --> 59:21.003
Oh, really? Who?

59:21.103 --> 59:25.103
Do you remember Sally? She used to
come round after school sometimes.

59:29.502 --> 59:30.402
Sally?

59:30.602 --> 59:31.902
Yeah. Sally.

59:32.102 --> 59:35.102
I saw her this morning,
round the corner, at Boston Park.

59:35.302 --> 59:37.303
Which is weird.
She's teaching there now.

59:38.603 --> 59:40.802
We had a chat
and we're going to hook up.

59:45.102 --> 59:46.202
Milo.

59:46.402 --> 59:47.702
What?

59:49.902 --> 59:51.702
Karen must have hurt you so much.

59:51.902 --> 59:54.001
What's Karen got to do with this?

59:55.601 --> 59:58.301
How did it feel, seeing Sally again?

59:59.901 --> 01:00:00.901
Well...

01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:03.301
Good, actually.

01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:04.701
Nice.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.900
Kind of put things in perspective.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.800
What are you doing?

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.899
I want to show you something.

01:00:33.399 --> 01:00:34.399
There.

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:37.099
What?

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.399
Sally.

01:00:38.499 --> 01:00:39.899
Where?

01:00:39.999 --> 01:00:41.199
Oh, Milo.

01:00:41.399 --> 01:00:43.299
What? I don't see her.

01:00:43.399 --> 01:00:47.598
When you were six,
she was in every photograph.

01:00:49.098 --> 01:00:51.198
What? What do you mean?

01:00:51.298 --> 01:00:53.198
After your father died,

01:00:53.398 --> 01:00:54.798
Sally turned up

01:00:54.998 --> 01:00:56.998
and kept you happy.

01:00:57.998 --> 01:00:59.498
I spoke to your teacher.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:03.197
She said it was normal for a child
of your age to have a friend like Sally.

01:01:03.397 --> 01:01:04.697
What? Sally wasn't...

01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:08.097
She appeared in our lives
right after your father died

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.997
and disappeared
when you started to forget him.

01:01:12.097 --> 01:01:15.696
No.

01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:18.696
She's turned up in your time of need.

01:01:20.396 --> 01:01:22.096
I think it's quite sweet.

01:01:22.296 --> 01:01:25.697
No, no, no. No, I'm not getting involved
in any spooky bullshit.

01:01:25.897 --> 01:01:28.196
I saw her today. I spoke to her.

01:01:32.396 --> 01:01:35.696
All I ever get from you
is a load of half-arsed astrology.

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:39.596
Whenever anything bad happens,
"Oh, well, it's meant to be. "

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:43.295
Well, I tell you, I saw this girl today.

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:44.595
I saw her!

01:01:44.795 --> 01:01:47.895
And if it's not Sally,
then it's somebody pretending to be her.

01:01:57.094 --> 01:01:58.094
Jesus.

01:02:05.994 --> 01:02:09.593
I think you just don't realise
how unhappy you've been.

01:02:11.593 --> 01:02:12.593
Milo.

01:02:16.393 --> 01:02:19.194
The world is full of people
sent here to help us.

01:02:19.294 --> 01:02:21.493
Most of the time, we just don't see them.

01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:26.193
Whatever it was she wanted to say to you,
you should listen.

01:02:26.293 --> 01:02:29.693
Do you know what you're saying?
Do you actually know what you're saying?

01:02:29.893 --> 01:02:31.093
Milo.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.192
What's happening?

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.792
You were a friend of David's?

01:02:44.992 --> 01:02:46.392
Not close.

01:02:46.592 --> 01:02:48.191
Army days.

01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:51.291
We was er... we was in Basra together.

01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:54.191
We met up again back here.

01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.191
Mostly at the centre.

01:02:57.791 --> 01:03:01.090
But er... I don't think Dave
would exactly count me as a mate.

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:09.690
I'm not proud of it, Mr Esser,
but I led the filth... straight to him.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.990
We was in a pub, down at the market.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:17.090
Anyhow, he started freaking out.

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.290
You know, banging on and on
about his dead sister.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.890
No, no. That's all right.

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:27.689
He was talking about Sarah.
What was he saying?

01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:31.389
He kept on asking me and asking me
how she died and I didn't know.

01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:35.389
An accident.

01:03:37.989 --> 01:03:41.088
Yeah, well, he got quite irate
about it all and... er...

01:03:41.288 --> 01:03:44.188
...luckily the Old Bill steamed in.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:48.288
They nicked him. They chased him
up on the bloody roof and nicked him.

01:03:48.388 --> 01:03:51.388
They told me...
They told me it was for Dave's own good.

01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:52.988
He needed help.

01:03:53.188 --> 01:03:55.687
He was a danger to the public
and they was right.

01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:56.987
Ta.

01:03:59.987 --> 01:04:03.887
Tips up here, right,
a couple of days ago, acting all weird.

01:04:04.087 --> 01:04:05.788
Asking about me.

01:04:05.988 --> 01:04:08.287
The creepy sod,
he follows me all the way home.

01:04:09.887 --> 01:04:12.887
I walk in and there he is,
sitting in my flat.

01:04:13.987 --> 01:04:15.987
Like fucking Batman.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:18.787
He breaks my fucking nose,

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:20.587
talks a load of shit at me

01:04:20.787 --> 01:04:22.286
and then buggers off.

01:04:22.486 --> 01:04:24.186
What was he saying?

01:04:29.686 --> 01:04:31.486
He gave me an address.

01:04:31.686 --> 01:04:33.186
An address?

01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:42.385
He said that someone was coming
to look him up.

01:04:45.185 --> 01:04:47.884
He didn't say anything about it
being his old man.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:48.984
Please?

01:04:50.384 --> 01:04:52.984
Bill, I'll leave the keys on my desk. OK?

01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:55.584
That's fine. Thanks, Teri. Good night.

01:04:58.884 --> 01:04:59.685
Look...

01:04:59.885 --> 01:05:02.484
Dave, he said he'd come back
and finish me off.

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:06.384
So, if it's you or the police
that finds him first,

01:05:06.584 --> 01:05:10.084
just make sure that he stays
the fucking hell away from me.

01:05:10.284 --> 01:05:11.784
Here.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.383
Who's Franklyn?

01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:25.083
That's the address. All right?

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:27.583
Myjob's done.

01:06:01.081 --> 01:06:03.081
Emilia?

01:06:04.281 --> 01:06:05.681
Are you all right?

01:06:05.881 --> 01:06:08.880
You didn't mention you were coming by.
Come and say hello.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.180
No, thanks. I need to speak to you.
It won't take long.

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.880
Darling, I'm in the middle of...

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.080
- What is it, sweetheart?
- I'll be in the study.

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.379
I'm so sorry. I...

01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.779
Please excuse me.

01:06:34.279 --> 01:06:37.178
What are you doing here?
You knew I had guests.

01:06:37.278 --> 01:06:39.778
- Please, Mother, sit down.
- I beg your pardon?

01:06:39.878 --> 01:06:42.478
The sooner you sit,
the sooner I'll be gone.

01:06:53.278 --> 01:06:55.178
Well?

01:06:57.178 --> 01:06:59.478
I want to talk about fairy tales.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.975
If a god is willing to prevent evil,
but not able,

01:07:31.175 --> 01:07:33.575
then he is not omnipotent.

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:37.475
If he is able but not willing,
then he must be malevolent.

01:07:38.575 --> 01:07:43.075
If he's neither able or willing,
then why call him a god?

01:07:47.575 --> 01:07:50.875
Why else do bad things happen
to good people?

01:07:54.275 --> 01:07:56.274
I...

01:07:57.474 --> 01:08:00.074
I always remembered it
as bedtime stories.

01:08:01.074 --> 01:08:03.174
But bad ones.

01:08:03.374 --> 01:08:06.374
Stories with horrible endings.

01:08:06.574 --> 01:08:09.573
- Emilia...
- Instead of "happy ever after",

01:08:09.773 --> 01:08:13.273
the Princess would wake up...

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:16.273
...and her Prince...

01:08:17.273 --> 01:08:19.673
...would have left her.

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:24.572
What do you want from me, Emilia?

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.772
I want you to admit...

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.171
...that you knew about it.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.971
That you remember.

01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:35.872
That you've had to live with it
all this time, just like I have.

01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:37.572
That's all.

01:08:39.272 --> 01:08:44.272
Is this what it's all been about?

01:08:44.471 --> 01:08:49.270
The way your father treated you?

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:52.671
I just wanted you to be on my side.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.370
He had a business trip.

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:11.270
Usually, I hated him going away,

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:14.370
but this one was a godsend.

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:18.669
The moment his foot was out of the door,
I packed everything up and took you away.

01:09:19.769 --> 01:09:21.769
Just like that.

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:26.169
I hoped we'd... we'd both forget,

01:09:27.469 --> 01:09:29.769
move on.

01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:36.469
Emilia?

01:09:55.968 --> 01:09:58.267
Thank you.

01:09:58.467 --> 01:10:01.967
I have to go now.
I have a project to finish.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:13.266
- Peter.
- Mr Tarrant.

01:10:13.466 --> 01:10:15.466
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:22.767
This is Frank Grant,
David's Military Welfare Officer.

01:10:22.866 --> 01:10:24.666
I hope you don't mind if he joins us.

01:10:24.866 --> 01:10:26.666
Mr Esser.

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:32.866
Peter, on the whole, we both felt it would
have been wiser if you'd stayed at home.

01:10:34.866 --> 01:10:39.265
When you find David...
what will happen?

01:10:39.365 --> 01:10:43.065
Well, obviously, he'll be returned
to this institution immediately.

01:10:44.265 --> 01:10:47.665
He was getting so much better.
The letter you sent...

01:10:47.865 --> 01:10:50.464
David's home visit
is a little redundant now.

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:57.464
As I told you, David took advantage
of his assessment hearing to escape.

01:10:58.864 --> 01:11:02.564
He was being fitted with a tag
when he went out of control.

01:11:03.963 --> 01:11:05.263
What?

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.063
What... what is it? What's happened?

01:11:09.263 --> 01:11:14.363
Mr Esser, your son assaulted
two hospital orderlies...

01:11:16.963 --> 01:11:19.963
...one ofwhom
died of his injuries this morning.

01:11:20.863 --> 01:11:23.963
We also have reason to believe

01:11:24.063 --> 01:11:27.163
there's a chance
he may still have his service weapon.

01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:30.262
Essentially, he's possibly armed.

01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:35.162
Are you ready to listen to us now, Peter?

01:12:33.859 --> 01:12:36.759
Mr Tarrant, if I...

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:38.958
If I talk to David...

01:12:40.658 --> 01:12:42.658
...talk some sense into him...

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:46.158
...would you at least reconsider?

01:12:49.058 --> 01:12:53.557
Peter, if you have any idea where David is,
you have to tell us.

01:12:53.757 --> 01:12:55.757
The police are involved now.

01:12:56.557 --> 01:13:00.057
I... I... I don't know where he is.

01:13:01.657 --> 01:13:04.857
Your daughter was killed
playing in the street outside your house

01:13:05.057 --> 01:13:08.057
just two weeks
before David came back from Iraq.

01:13:08.157 --> 01:13:11.357
What's Sarah got to do with it?
Why are you talking about this?

01:13:11.457 --> 01:13:13.557
We think it's key to David's condition.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:19.856
It was clear from his evaluation
that he holds an individual responsible.

01:13:20.056 --> 01:13:23.756
Now, you wouldn't happen to know
who that might be?

01:13:23.856 --> 01:13:25.656
You?

01:13:25.856 --> 01:13:28.256
God, maybe?

01:13:29.256 --> 01:13:33.155
It was God's will
that Sarah was taken from us.

01:13:33.255 --> 01:13:36.855
We spoke to Anne earlier today, Peter.

01:13:37.055 --> 01:13:40.355
She seemed to think
that you were fairly convinced

01:13:40.555 --> 01:13:42.755
of God's hand in finding David.

01:13:42.855 --> 01:13:45.754
- Your ex-wife thinks you're deluded.
- Frank!

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:49.054
What are you saying?
Why would she say that?

01:13:50.354 --> 01:13:52.954
I came here to help.

01:13:53.154 --> 01:13:55.654
To help bring my son back home.

01:13:55.854 --> 01:14:00.154
Peter, if he does in any way
hold you responsible,

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:02.354
however mistaken...

01:14:03.454 --> 01:14:06.654
...there's no telling what he might do,
if you approached him.

01:14:08.154 --> 01:14:11.053
We have been severely tested
as a family, Mr Tarrant.

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:15.953
But I have trust in God.

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:20.653
I... I should go back to Cambridge.

01:14:21.553 --> 01:14:26.052
I... I think you're right.
I... I should wait for him there.

01:14:26.952 --> 01:14:28.152
Thank you.

01:14:28.352 --> 01:14:30.752
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:34.052
Good evening.

01:14:34.152 --> 01:14:37.252
So, Wormsnakes told me
he delivered my message.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:40.251
I decided to give
the little traitor his life.

01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:45.251
In a way, I wanted tonight's assassination
to be unique.

01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:46.751
Pure.

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:51.450
It felt like the last pieces of the jigsaw
were falling into place.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:55.851
But don't get me wrong.
This wasn't fate.

01:14:58.251 --> 01:15:03.151
For every soul ofthis deluded population
who believed in fate's comic clockwork,

01:15:03.351 --> 01:15:07.150
they neglect to see the wear and tear
beneath the surface.

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.950
The teeth that grind into the cogs.

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:13.850
The damage that fate causes so many
in its selfish journey

01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:17.749
towards just one favourable consequence.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:23.649
The Individual had simply run out of luck,
and I was here to collect.

01:16:53.844 --> 01:16:56.744
- Hello?
- Hello. Yes. David? Hello?

01:16:56.844 --> 01:16:58.344
No. You've got the wrong...

01:17:02.244 --> 01:17:05.543
David? Is that you?

01:17:06.843 --> 01:17:12.443
Hello? David, please. We've got to talk.
I don't care what you've done.

01:17:15.443 --> 01:17:18.742
Listen, I'll be across the road,
in the restaurant.

01:17:20.442 --> 01:17:23.142
For fuck's sake.

01:17:56.741 --> 01:17:59.140
- Shit.
- Hello?

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.840
Yes?

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.740
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I've just moved in upstairs.

01:18:11.939 --> 01:18:13.939
Coming.

01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:21.839
Hello. John Preest.

01:18:22.039 --> 01:18:23.839
Upstairs?

01:18:23.939 --> 01:18:25.738
My buzzer doesn't seem to be working.

01:18:25.938 --> 01:18:27.639
You've moved in upstairs?

01:18:28.839 --> 01:18:32.539
I'm sorry to introduce myself like this,
but it's as good a time as any.

01:18:32.739 --> 01:18:35.039
Thanks,
but I was just doing something, and...

01:18:36.139 --> 01:18:38.639
I... am expecting someone.

01:18:39.438 --> 01:18:41.238
I heard your buzzer go.

01:18:41.338 --> 01:18:43.038
Yeah, the intercom's wired up wrong.

01:18:43.938 --> 01:18:46.738
A guyjust rang asking for David.

01:18:46.938 --> 01:18:49.638
He said he's across the road,
at the restaurant.

01:18:49.738 --> 01:18:52.137
- The restaurant?
- Yeah.

01:18:54.037 --> 01:18:56.437
- You're sure?
- Yeah, the restaurant.

01:18:57.737 --> 01:19:00.837
Now, excuse me. I have to go.
Good night.

01:20:06.133 --> 01:20:08.133
Hello?

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:09.433
Jesus.

01:20:09.633 --> 01:20:11.633
It's me again.

01:20:12.732 --> 01:20:14.732
You're not gonna believe this.

01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:49.831
- What are you doing?
- Please don't make a sound.

01:20:50.031 --> 01:20:51.831
It's better if you don't.

01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:55.530
- You hurt me.
- Stay quiet.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.130
Don't be afraid.

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:12.530
I have a simple job to do.
It'll be over soon.

01:21:27.729 --> 01:21:30.129
- What's your faith?
- What?

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:34.728
- Your religion. What is it?
- I'm not religious.

01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:43.328
How long have you been
in Meanwhile City?

01:21:45.928 --> 01:21:47.727
What?

01:21:56.727 --> 01:21:59.027
Hello.

01:21:59.227 --> 01:22:01.226
Well...

01:22:02.426 --> 01:22:04.727
Hello back.

01:22:15.826 --> 01:22:18.926
- Meanwhile City?
- Yes.

01:22:19.026 --> 01:22:21.626
- Where is that?
- Quiet.

01:22:26.226 --> 01:22:29.925
- This is London. Where is it you think...
- Will you shut up?

01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:34.025
- Just stay back.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:34.225 --> 01:22:36.225
- Stay there.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:43.724
I feel a bit stupid now.

01:22:43.924 --> 01:22:46.524
- Why?
- Why do you think?

01:22:46.724 --> 01:22:48.824
There's nothing to feel stupid about.

01:22:49.824 --> 01:22:52.224
You always knew, really.

01:22:52.324 --> 01:22:55.223
How's the wine?

01:22:55.323 --> 01:22:57.724
You want to make small talk now?

01:22:57.824 --> 01:23:00.324
If I'm going to have
an imaginary conversation,

01:23:00.524 --> 01:23:03.924
I'd like to think it might be
a bit more fucking interesting than this.

01:23:08.723 --> 01:23:11.323
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

01:23:11.523 --> 01:23:13.723
So, my mum was right?

01:23:13.923 --> 01:23:15.423
Kind of.

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:18.423
If you believe in something
strongly enough,

01:23:18.623 --> 01:23:20.722
who's to say if it's real or not?

01:23:20.922 --> 01:23:21.922
Amen.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:26.022
- I thought you were an atheist.
- Yeah, very funny.

01:23:26.222 --> 01:23:30.622
- So, what happens now?
- Time to tie up loose ends, I guess.

01:23:30.722 --> 01:23:32.822
Like what?

01:23:33.022 --> 01:23:35.021
It was me who told you that story.

01:23:35.221 --> 01:23:38.421
The one about the storyteller
and the princess.

01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:41.021
That's been bothering you. Right?

01:23:41.121 --> 01:23:44.421
Well, if it was you who told me,
then that means it must have...

01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:47.520
Come from you? Sure.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.821
Well, if that's true,
then why don't I understand what it means?

01:23:51.021 --> 01:23:53.021
You know.

01:23:54.421 --> 01:23:57.621
Go on. Try.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.120
The storyteller was...

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120
...so used to his fantasies that...

01:24:14.119 --> 01:24:17.619
...no matter how good his reality was,
it was never enough.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:20.019
Would never be enough.

01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:24.519
You see? The first step to recovery
is understanding the problem.

01:24:37.618 --> 01:24:38.418
No!

01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:40.018
Agh! No!

01:24:47.618 --> 01:24:49.118
What's happening here?

01:24:50.918 --> 01:24:53.318
- I have to go now.
- Why?

01:24:54.717 --> 01:24:58.617
Can't you feel it? It's nearly time.

01:25:24.615 --> 01:25:29.815
Life's too much of an adventure as it is
without making anything else up.

01:25:30.815 --> 01:25:32.815
I just wanted to let you know that
before I go.

01:25:33.015 --> 01:25:36.114
- Please. Please don't.
- Milo...

01:25:36.314 --> 01:25:37.914
You're such a romantic.

01:25:39.615 --> 01:25:41.615
Use it for somebody else.

01:25:46.715 --> 01:25:49.914
Sally, we can...

01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:53.014
No, we can't.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:56.014
Listen. I don't care.

01:25:57.114 --> 01:25:59.714
- I don't care.
- It's for the best.

01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:30.411
Mr Preest. Mr Preest!

01:26:33.312 --> 01:26:36.912
- What are you doing?
- Go, or I'll kill us both.

01:26:38.112 --> 01:26:41.012
If you really knew me,
you'd get out of here right now.

01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:42.611
See?

01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:58.810
David?

01:27:31.209 --> 01:27:34.409
Drop the gun.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:01.407
What was your name?

01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:05.806
Emilia.

01:28:07.806 --> 01:28:09.606
David.

01:28:11.606 --> 01:28:13.606
In this world my name is David.

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:24.506
I think it's time you left.

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.501
Will you be all right?

01:29:36.701 --> 01:29:38.701
I'll go and find some help.

01:30:02.899 --> 01:30:06.399
- Excuse me. Please...
- Sir, are you OK? Have you been hurt?

01:30:06.499 --> 01:30:08.700
- No, I'm fine.
- Well, hold on. We'll get to you.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.400
No, you don't understand.
Someone's been shot.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.500
- What? Where?
- Him.

01:30:34.698 --> 01:30:36.698
You're hurt.

01:34:38.785 --> 01:34:40.885
Fading World

01:34:52.784 --> 01:34:56.084
âª This land
âª Is ahead of its time

01:34:56.284 --> 01:35:00.583
âª Oh, but you know it's past its prime
in so many ways

01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:05.983
âª This land
âª Is a miserable rock

01:35:06.183 --> 01:35:08.383
âª Stuck like a foot at the end of a sock

01:35:08.483 --> 01:35:10.482
âª Full of razor blades

01:35:13.382 --> 01:35:17.082
âª Is mine
âª The right to defend at all

01:35:17.982 --> 01:35:22.182
âª Is mine
âª To fight to the end, I know

01:35:22.282 --> 01:35:27.581
âª My hand
âª Can hold back the seas no more

01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:29.581
âª But it's not from man

01:35:29.781 --> 01:35:32.982
âª That we need defending

01:35:33.182 --> 01:35:36.682
âª Cos you don't need your weapons now

01:35:36.882 --> 01:35:41.181
âª You've got to hold on to your world

01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:46.081
âª So, stop and put your weapons down

01:35:46.781 --> 01:35:51.580
âª You've got to hold on to your world

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.980
âª This fading world

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.979
âª This land
âª Has damaged the world

01:36:05.079 --> 01:36:08.879
âª How many times these bells have tolled
I've heard many tales

01:36:11.979 --> 01:36:14.979
âª This land
âª Is riddled with lies

01:36:15.079 --> 01:36:20.078
âª How many told how the seas
would rise with such heavy scales

01:36:22.078 --> 01:36:26.679
âª Is mine
âª To know what I've seen and done

01:36:26.879 --> 01:36:31.478
âª Is mine
âª The suffering and screams at home

01:36:31.678 --> 01:36:36.478
âª My hand
âª Can't find New Orleans at all

01:36:36.578 --> 01:36:41.878
âª This desperate land
that seems to be ending

01:36:41.978 --> 01:36:45.477
âª Cos you don't need your weapons now

01:36:45.677 --> 01:36:49.877
âª You've got to hold on to your world

01:36:52.077 --> 01:36:55.477
âª So, stop and put your weapons down

01:36:55.677 --> 01:36:59.876
âª You've got to hold on to your world

01:37:00.676 --> 01:37:02.676
âª This fading world

01:37:20.876 --> 01:37:25.075
âª This land

01:37:40.874 --> 01:37:45.074
âª Is mine
