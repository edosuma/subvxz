After everything you've done,
you owe her that much.

14:52.309 --> 14:56.522
I owe her more, but there's a difference
between what I should do

14:56.605 --> 14:58.649
and what I'm able to do.

14:59.233 --> 15:03.987
The queen... She has my family.
My wife, my children.

15:05.948 --> 15:09.785
Everything I've done,
I've done to keep them alive.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.788
I'm sorry you've had to suffer
because of it,

15:12.871 --> 15:15.040
but you know better than anyone

15:15.123 --> 15:19.920
when someone you love is in danger,
you'll do anything to save them.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.134
I do understand.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.639
Me, too.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.307
I also apparently understand.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.768
No one has to know
that you helped us, rabbit.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.020
The Red Queen would know!

15:37.104 --> 15:40.899
And even if you found another way
out of Wonderland, she'd blame me!

15:40.983 --> 15:43.986
It was my job to stay with you,
to be her ears,

15:44.069 --> 15:46.238
to tell her everything you were doing.

15:47.573 --> 15:52.619
What if we rescued them? Your family.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.288
We can all leave together.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.206
Well, you'd have to find them first.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.333
I've already searched
every place I can think of

15:58.417 --> 16:01.378
where the queen would hide them,
and failed miserably.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.132
All right.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.051
Maybe I can help.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.889
I might not know where the queen
stashed something important,

16:11.972 --> 16:14.183
but I do know where Anastasia might.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.644

It means it's a damn good thing
that we were here to help.

What about next time?

18:01.373 --> 18:04.918
-Next time I'll be more careful.
-And the time after that?

18:05.002 --> 18:08.672
What kind of life is this for Alice?
Always hunted, sleeping under trees.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.258
It's a life we chose. Together.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.220
Just because you chose it
doesn't make it right for you or her.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.432
I've known Alice
since she was a little girl.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.310
She always wanted a place to call home.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.896
I'm her home now. As she is mine.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.315
Yeah, uh...
Must you always speak in metaphor?

18:26.398 --> 18:29.484
It's the truth. You know,
we may not have a warm hearth

18:29.568 --> 18:33.155
or a roof to sleep under,
but our life together,

18:33.238 --> 18:35.240
it's better than we could have imagined.

18:35.574 --> 18:40.579
As I said, for now.
But we both know this can't go on forever.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.751
You know, I spent years
alone in that bottle.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.337

I should be alone once more?

18:49.213 --> 18:51.507
If my family were in danger,

18:51.590 --> 18:54.134
I would do whatever it took
to protect them.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.180
Perhaps the only way
to truly protect Alice

18:58.889 --> 19:00.807
is to let her go.

This doesn't make sense.
He should be here.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.645
-Anywhere else he might have gone?
-No.

31:36.897 --> 31:40.234
-Maybe he's left a note.
-What do you think I'm looking for?

31:40.317 --> 31:41.693
There's nothing here!

31:45.072 --> 31:46.740
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

31:46.823 --> 31:49.326
-I know what you're thinking.
-I'm not thinking anything.

31:49.409 --> 31:52.246
-You're thinking he's been captured.
-Never said that.

31:52.329 --> 31:54.623
You think he died trying to escape.

31:54.706 --> 31:57.084
Or do you think he didn't really escape
in the first place?

31:57.167 --> 32:01.129
I think he's not here, Alice,
which means we're running out of time.

32:01.213 --> 32:02.464
And options.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.509
Now the rabbit's outside.
If we're gonna leave Wonderland...

32:05.592 --> 32:07.928
We're not leaving without Cyrus.

32:11.265 --> 32:12.641
We're not.

32:15.561 --> 32:17.187
(SIGHS)

32:19.815 --> 32:22.067
-Cyrus?
-Alice, I'm sorry.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.486
-Cyrus!
-Alice?

32:24.570 --> 32:25.988
-(WHOOSHING)
-Cyrus!

32:26.446 --> 32:27.781
Alice!

32:32.744 --> 32:34.246
(BOTH LAUGHING)

32:34.329 --> 32:36.665
(GASPS) I thought I'd never see you again.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.751
Even in my dreams
I was afraid to imagine this moment

32:39.835 --> 32:41.753
and feared that it would never come true.

32:41.837 --> 32:44.464
But it's here. You're here.

32:44.548 --> 32:46.633
I'm here. It's over.

32:47.217 --> 32:48.218
(GASPS)

32:53.557 --> 32:54.975
Well, I wouldn't quite say "over."

32:56.560 --> 32:57.603
Hello, Alice.

32:59.062 --> 33:01.231
What the bloody hell is she doing here?

33:02.983 --> 33:04.193
She's here to help us.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.872
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:16.955 --> 33:20.751
She's going to help us?
You've got to be joking.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.003
No time for joking, darling.
You see that storm coming?

33:23.086 --> 33:25.464
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:25.547 --> 33:28.967
That is Jafar, and he's coming for us.
For all of us.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.636
She's telling the truth, Alice.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.638
Why would he be after you?
You're his partner.

33:32.721 --> 33:35.057
Was his partner. Yes, it's true,

33:35.140 --> 33:38.018
we used to work together,
but I am not like him.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.521
When it became clear that
he was no longer playing

33:40.604 --> 33:43.690
-by the rules of the game...
-Don't believe a word.

33:43.774 --> 33:46.276
-She knows how to lie, this one.
-(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:46.860 --> 33:48.695
(INHALES) We can argue all we like

33:48.779 --> 33:51.823
when we get out of Wonderland,
but for now, dig, bunny!

33:52.741 --> 33:54.451
I'm not going anywhere with her.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.203
-(THUNDER RUMBLING)
-We may not have a choice.

33:56.286 --> 33:58.956
What if Will's right?
What if this is an elaborate ruse?

33:59.039 --> 34:01.834
Alice, what more do you want me to do?
I brought you your bloody genie!

34:01.917 --> 34:03.669
You took him from me, too!

34:04.378 --> 34:06.505
Alice, you need to trust me.

34:06.588 --> 34:09.508
-I will never trust you!
-Alice.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.553
(ALICE SIGHS)

34:18.100 --> 34:19.852
Tell me why.

34:20.644 --> 34:23.188
Why you did all of this?

34:23.272 --> 34:27.109
Why you made an alliance
with a madman, and I'll go.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.902
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

34:28.986 --> 34:32.489
But I need a reason. I need something.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.370
I thought he could get me what I want.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.622
-And what was that?
-You've got everything.

34:41.164 --> 34:44.793
-What more could you need?
-You, Will.

34:44.877 --> 34:47.754
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

34:47.838 --> 34:49.423
I wanted you.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.218
-I want you back.
-More lies.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.804
No. I'm telling the truth now.
I'm telling the truth.

34:55.888 --> 34:58.807
You had me. All of me.

34:58.891 --> 35:02.686
My heart, my soul, my life,

35:03.145 --> 35:05.981
and you tossed me aside
like a piece of rubbish,

35:06.064 --> 35:07.608
all for a little red crown.

35:07.691 --> 35:08.859
I made a mistake.

35:08.942 --> 35:11.612
I see that now. Don't you see
that's why I've done all this?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.405
So Jafar can change the laws of magic

35:13.488 --> 35:16.658
so we can undo the mistake,
change the past. Will!

35:16.742 --> 35:17.993
Will, wait.

35:19.536 --> 35:21.914
I would give up my crown.
I would give up anything.

35:21.997 --> 35:27.127
Everything, just to go back
to a time when you loved me.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.214
Please, Will.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.675
I want you back.

35:35.260 --> 35:36.637
You'll never have me.

my apologies,

The genie's here. The bottle's here.

The wish is here. What do you think
Jafar's gonna do when he arrives, eh?

36:19.471 --> 36:20.973
We'll go,
and you'll have to answer to him.

36:21.056 --> 36:23.976
No, 'cause you're forgetting something.
I have the bottle.

36:24.059 --> 36:27.145
-Which I'll gladly relieve you of.
-Alice, there is no time to fight,

there's only time to die.
We need to leave.

We have to leave! Now please!
I'm telling the truth!

-I do.

back in the bottle.
