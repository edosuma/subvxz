Robin, La'gaan, Beetle, you're Gamma.

13:13.257 --> 13:15.533
Prep the Bio-Ship.
You're headed to New Orleans.

13:15.693 --> 13:17.764
Gamma always gets the soft gigs.

13:17.928 --> 13:20.499
Tim, you'll be running Gamma.

13:20.664 --> 13:23.668
Me? Dick, I've never led a squad before.

13:23.834 --> 13:27.111
Making this a good opportunity
to get your feet wet as field leader.

13:27.271 --> 13:29.751
Because it's Gamma
and you're not expecting trouble?

13:29.907 --> 13:32.319
Or because we're stretched thin
and you have no choice?

13:33.844 --> 13:35.380
Just don't die, okay?

13:37.214 --> 13:40.161
And no unnecessary risks to the squad.

I knew we got the soft gig.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.941

There's no Zeta-Tube here.
