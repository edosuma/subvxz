$26,340. You take it, you

00:28.568 --> 00:30.234
Give it to him, he lets you go.

00:30.269 --> 00:31.585
I don't belong to f-Bomb

00:32.936 --> 00:33.532
Anyone.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.267
He took the money?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.065
Yes, sir.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.700
I was completely fooled.

00:36.735 --> 00:38.618
How long did you know her?

00:38.653 --> 00:40.243
Uh, a little over a month.

00:40.278 --> 00:41.722
Said she could buy her way out

00:41.757 --> 00:44.129
If she had enough money to give

00:44.164 --> 00:46.066
To her pimp. I gave her $18,000.

00:46.101 --> 00:47.517
Did she give you a name?

00:47.552 --> 00:48.934
She told me her name was

00:48.969 --> 00:49.899
Candy.

00:49.934 --> 00:51.534

Get his helmet.

01:10.834 --> 01:12.234

01:12.269 --> 01:13.566
Make sure he did, Tommy.

01:13.601 --> 01:15.151
You can't blame Tommy. There

01:15.186 --> 01:16.701
Was nothing that he could have

01:16.736 --> 01:17.399
Done.

01:17.434 --> 01:18.399

Very bad thing, and he's gonna

Be in jail for a very long time,

01:55.895 --> 01:57.801
But nobody's gonna kill him, OK?

01:57.836 --> 01:59.032
OK.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.699
Good night.

02:00.734 --> 02:01.767

02:26.702 --> 02:28.684
Thing as limbo, OK? No limbo.

This 83rd birthday party. He's

07:23.436 --> 07:25.001
Just driving me nuts with it,

07:25.036 --> 07:26.502
You know what I mean? So I can't

07:26.537 --> 07:27.802
Afford to hire somebody, and,

07:27.837 --> 07:29.067
You know, you two get along, so

07:29.102 --> 07:29.632
I figured...

07:29.667 --> 07:30.717

07:30.752 --> 07:31.643
You know what? Let me tell

07:31.678 --> 07:32.905
You something. In a normal

07:32.940 --> 07:34.287
Family situation, you know,

07:34.322 --> 07:35.561
Somebody asking a sister-In-Law

07:35.596 --> 07:36.782
To help out with the paternal

07:36.817 --> 07:37.925
Grandfather would be considered,

07:37.960 --> 07:39.033
Like, you know, run of the mill

07:39.068 --> 07:39.799
Stuff.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.767
Yeah. Here's the thing. In a

07:41.802 --> 07:43.835
Normal family, a chick who

07:43.870 --> 07:45.352
Marries a cousin wouldn't be

07:45.387 --> 07:46.799
Considered a sister-In-Law,

07:46.834 --> 07:48.701
Number one, and when that cousin

07:48.736 --> 07:49.367
Dies...

07:50.634 --> 07:52.850
it does not signal open banging

07:52.885 --> 07:54.693
Season on said sister-In-Law.

07:54.728 --> 07:56.501
Hey, hey! That was a 2-Way

07:56.536 --> 07:57.334
Street, sister.

07:57.369 --> 07:58.601

07:59.400 --> 08:02.667
Hang on.

08:02.702 --> 08:03.499

08:03.534 --> 08:05.317
Yo, it's me. Yeah, look, I

List of demands for you.

08:08.453 --> 08:09.677
It took you long enough.

08:09.712 --> 08:11.089

08:11.124 --> 08:12.329
Bro? She hates your guts. I

09:41.719 --> 09:43.210
Guilty about pullin' that

09:43.245 --> 09:45.073

At school without there being

Something wrong?

17:01.534 --> 17:02.668
Something's wrong. Get in. We

17:02.703 --> 17:03.467
Gotta talk.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.384
Pretty cool lookin' thunderbird.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.534
This is about the condoms,

17:11.569 --> 17:12.651
Isn't it?

17:12.685 --> 17:13.699
What?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.134
The whole point of talking

17:15.169 --> 17:16.518
To a teenager about sex while

17:16.553 --> 17:17.792
You're in a moving vehicle is so

17:17.828 --> 17:19.034
That neither one of has to make

17:19.069 --> 17:19.699
Eye contact.

17:19.733 --> 17:20.833
Sorry. I got--I got ya.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.598
Sorry. Sorry.

17:21.634 --> 17:22.499
All right, look, I--I

17:22.534 --> 17:23.849
Purposely left the condoms in a

17:23.885 --> 17:25.376
Drawer that I know she checks.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.305
It was my way of telling her

17:27.339 --> 17:29.200
That I w, you know, sexually

17:29.235 --> 17:30.501
Active.

17:30.536 --> 17:31.733
You are?

17:31.768 --> 17:33.167
Well, what did you think I

17:33.202 --> 17:34.301
Was doin', sellin' them?

17:34.336 --> 17:35.401
I--I didn't--I--I wasn't

17:35.436 --> 17:36.566
Sure.

17:36.601 --> 17:37.467
No. I've been havin' sex for

17:37.502 --> 17:38.532
Months now.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.984
So you don't really need to

17:41.019 --> 17:43.401
Have the sex talk then, right?

17:43.436 --> 17:44.218
Eyes.

17:44.253 --> 17:44.965
Right.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.032
The sex talk? No.

17:46.067 --> 17:48.100
I got plenty of information

17:48.135 --> 17:49.200
From Mrs. Turbody.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.466
Mrs...?

17:50.501 --> 17:54.467
She's my science teacher.

17:54.502 --> 17:58.434
Oh. OK. Cool. Good. All

17:58.469 --> 17:59.165
Right.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.567
This girl that you're ha

18:02.602 --> 18:03.267
You know--

18:03.302 --> 18:03.968
Sex with?

18:04.003 --> 18:04.618
Yeah.

18:04.653 --> 18:05.199
Yeah.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.833
She seems pretty young. I

18:06.868 --> 18:07.366
Mean--

18:07.401 --> 18:08.566
Well, it--She looks a lot

18:08.601 --> 18:11.900
Younger than she is. Mean, she looks lik

18:11.935 --> 18:13.684
Well, she's 38, but, uh, she

18:13.719 --> 18:15.026
Looks like she could pass for--

18:15.061 --> 18:16.334
Wait, wait, wait--Whoa, whoa,

18:16.369 --> 18:17.199
Whoa. Who's 38?

18:17.234 --> 18:18.067
You're making eye contact

18:18.102 --> 18:18.633
Again.

18:18.668 --> 18:20.668
Sorry. Who's 38?

18:20.703 --> 18:22.085
Mrs. Turbody.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.432
Holy shit!

18:23.467 --> 18:24.534
Hey, hey, watch the road,

18:24.569 --> 18:25.567
Man!

18:28.900 --> 18:30.284
Let me get this straight.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.668
I'm bangin' my science

18:31.703 --> 18:32.366
Teacher.

18:32.401 --> 18:34.234
Mrs. Turbody, who's obviously

18:34.269 --> 18:34.999
Married.

18:35.034 --> 18:36.767
No, no. She's widowed,

18:36.802 --> 18:38.418
Actually. That's kinda how we

18:38.453 --> 18:39.843
Connected. Uh, you know, the

18:39.878 --> 18:41.339
Grieving process, the different

18:41.374 --> 18:42.800
Stages of it, blah, blah, blah.

18:42.835 --> 18:43.699
Blah,

18:43.734 --> 18:44.734
Yeah. I got that from you.

18:44.769 --> 18:45.734
Yeah, I know where you got it

18:45.769 --> 18:46.399
From, OK?

18:46.434 --> 18:47.467
What are you so mad about?

18:47.502 --> 18:49.151
I'm not--I'm not angry.

18:49.186 --> 18:51.593
I'm--I'm--I'm concerned, you

18:51.628 --> 18:54.000
Know? Gee, I--Are you OK?

18:54.035 --> 18:54.932
Yeah.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.134
I mean--I mean, mentally,

18:56.169 --> 18:57.301
You--You know, you all right?

18:57.336 --> 18:58.466
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.534
'Cause, you know, I--I've

19:07.636 --> 19:08.385

Serious stuff. I mean, this

19:18.419 --> 19:20.132
Could scar you for life.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.367
Yeah, I sure as hell hope so.

19:21.402 --> 19:23.032
No, I mean, you could

19:23.067 --> 19:24.384
Literally end up bein' my age

19:24.419 --> 19:25.693
And still have the--The mental

19:25.728 --> 19:26.967
Images from this, you know, in

19:27.002 --> 19:28.467
The front of your brain.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.334
Seriously?

19:30.369 --> 19:31.299
Yeah.

19:31.334 --> 19:33.967
Whoo! Ha ha! All right!

Talk to Mrs. Peabody.

19:39.002 --> 19:39.901
Turbody.

19:39.936 --> 19:40.765
Whatever.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.366
But I like her.

19:42.401 --> 19:44.501

19:44.536 --> 19:46.318
To like? What the hell? Where

19:46.353 --> 19:48.100
Was Mrs. Turbody when I was in

19:48.135 --> 19:49.334

19:49.369 --> 19:50.534

Hey, hi.

Oh, great. Thanks, rose.

20:50.234 --> 20:52.017
Yes? Come in.

20:52.052 --> 20:53.800
Mrs. Turbody?

20:53.835 --> 20:56.332
Yes.

20:56.367 --> 20:57.898
Oh, my God.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.299
How can I help you?

20:59.334 --> 21:01.301
I'm, uh--I'm here about my

21:01.336 --> 21:03.032
Godson, Damian Keefe?

21:03.067 --> 21:05.234
Oh, yes. He's a wonderful

21:05.269 --> 21:07.401
Student. Bit of a handful

21:07.436 --> 21:08.534
Sometimes, though.

21:08.569 --> 21:09.432
Mm-Hmm.

21:09.467 --> 21:10.867
He's not taking any of my

21:10.902 --> 21:11.933
Classes this semester.

21:11.968 --> 21:13.332
Oh.

21:13.367 --> 21:14.934
He's taking my daughter's

21:14.969 --> 21:16.501
Science class. She finds him to

21:16.536 --> 21:18.000
Be, apparently, very

21:18.035 --> 21:18.768
Entertaining.

21:18.803 --> 21:19.765
Hmm.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.933
Her classroom is one flight

21:20.968 --> 21:22.067
Up, end of the hall.

21:22.102 --> 21:23.132
OK, thank you.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.367
You're very welcome.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.299
OK.

21:29.334 --> 21:30.900
So let's do another one.

21:30.935 --> 21:32.032
Uh, excuse me?

21:32.067 --> 21:32.967
So that's the chemical

21:33.002 --> 21:33.666
Equation...

21:33.701 --> 21:35.567
I'm lookin' for Mrs. Turbody.

21:35.602 --> 21:37.717
Right here.

21:37.752 --> 21:40.043
You're, uh...

21:40.078 --> 21:42.299
no, no,y. Do you

21:42.334 --> 21:43.366
Want to ask me something?

21:43.401 --> 21:47.517
Um, I'm, uh, Damian Keefe's,

21:47.552 --> 21:50.443
Uh, godfather. That's who I am.

21:50.478 --> 21:52.489
You know what? Why don't you

21:52.524 --> 21:54.466
Take that and go in the other

21:54.501 --> 21:56.900
But I thought you said

21:56.935 --> 21:59.301
I could stay.

21:59.336 --> 22:01.633
Just go.

22:01.668 --> 22:05.000
So you're Damian's godfather,

22:05.035 --> 22:06.366
And...?

22:06.401 --> 22:09.851
And...and, quite frankly,

22:09.886 --> 22:12.876
Missy, I'm pretty disgusted by

22:12.911 --> 22:15.867
The, uh--The...what are you

22:15.902 --> 22:17.299
Writing down?

22:17.334 --> 22:20.133
I'll only discuss this off

22:20.168 --> 22:23.050
School grounds, over drinks in a

22:23.085 --> 22:26.393
Dark, very quiet saloon, Mr...

22:26.428 --> 22:29.701
uh, Tommy. Mr. Tommy, um...

22:29.736 --> 22:30.399
Mr. Tommy?

22:30.434 --> 22:33.150
Yes, Mr. Tommy Gavin.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.867
You're the firefighter.

22:35.902 --> 22:37.566
Right.

22:37.601 --> 22:39.234
He's told me about you.

22:39.269 --> 22:41.366
What did he say?

22:41.401 --> 22:43.184
About the pills and the booze

22:43.219 --> 22:44.967
And the affair you had with his

22:45.002 --> 22:45.699
Mother.

22:45.734 --> 22:47.867
OK. I can explain almost all

22:47.902 --> 22:49.001
Of that.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.100
Call me.

22:54.534 --> 22:56.200
Oh, God.

23:00.601 --> 23:02.199
Well?

23:02.234 --> 23:04.117
We got a situation here.

23:04.152 --> 23:06.576
What are you talkin' about?

23:06.611 --> 23:09.222
You gotta stop foolin' around

23:09.257 --> 23:11.078
Hook 'cause I gotta have some

23:11.113 --> 23:13.440
Time to figure this thing out.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.733
No way, man. I love her.

23:15.768 --> 23:18.833
You love her. You know, every

23:18.868 --> 23:21.017
Time you have, you know...

23:21.052 --> 23:22.926
sex. It called sex.

23:22.961 --> 23:24.765
I know what it'E

23:24.800 --> 23:25.767
If there are some cigarettes in

23:25.802 --> 23:26.984
That glove compartment. I could

23:27.019 --> 23:28.167
Have sworn I left some in here.

23:28.202 --> 23:30.765
Uh...no.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.467
Shit. Ugh! All right, here's

23:35.502 --> 23:40.099
The deal. You ever look, you

23:40.134 --> 23:42.634
Know, behind your mom's TV setthe home E

23:42.669 --> 23:43.868
System, all that stuff is?

23:43.903 --> 23:45.067
You ever look behind there?

23:45.102 --> 23:45.633
No.

23:45.668 --> 23:47.267
OK, if you did, you'd see

23:47.302 --> 23:48.951
That there's a whole, you know,

23:48.986 --> 23:50.560
Gaggle of wires back there and

23:50.595 --> 23:52.164
Connections and stuff, and

23:52.199 --> 23:53.666
There's inputs and there's

23:53.701 --> 23:55.234
Outputs, and it's kind of like

23:55.269 --> 23:56.768
Your interior pleasure center.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.633
Like your brain is wired

23:58.668 --> 24:00.534
Directly to your penis, OK? So,

24:00.569 --> 24:02.018
You know, you got all kinds of

24:02.053 --> 24:03.277
Inputs and outputs. If you put

24:03.312 --> 24:04.339
The wrong input into the wrong

24:04.374 --> 24:05.704
Output, next thing you know,

24:05.739 --> 24:06.969
Your brain is sendin' the wrong

24:07.004 --> 24:08.802
Signal to your dick, and you can

24:08.837 --> 24:10.285
Get completely screwed up, OK?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.544
So it's OK now when you're 18

24:11.579 --> 24:12.773
Years old, and you're bangin' a

24:12.808 --> 24:14.204
Hot, you know, 38-Year-Old Mrs.

24:14.239 --> 24:15.470
Turbody, but then, you know, you

24:15.505 --> 24:16.836
Could turn into a 45-Year-Old

24:16.871 --> 24:18.167
Man--My age--And, you know,

24:18.202 --> 24:18.985
All of a sudden,

24:19.020 --> 24:19.733
You want to bang

24:19.768 --> 24:22.267
70-Year-Old broads, OK? You want

24:22.302 --> 24:23.251
That? Huh?

24:23.286 --> 24:24.165
No.

24:24.200 --> 24:24.967
Huh? You ever see your

24:25.002 --> 24:25.601
Grandmother naked?

24:25.636 --> 24:26.566
Hell, no!

24:26.601 --> 24:27.634
OK, I'm talkin' about seein'

24:27.669 --> 24:28.633
Her naked wantin' to bang

24:28.668 --> 24:30.451
Her. You want that? Now, that's

24:30.486 --> 24:31.826
Completely screwed up. I'm late.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.014
Now you gotta come to my next

24:33.049 --> 24:34.141
Appointment with me. As far as

24:34.176 --> 24:35.405
Your mom's concerned, you are

24:35.440 --> 24:36.453
Sellin' these condoms in school,

24:36.488 --> 24:37.467
Just like you were sellin' those

24:37.502 --> 24:38.184
Drugs. Got it?

24:38.219 --> 24:39.076
Yeah, got it.

24:39.111 --> 24:39.898
All right.

24:39.933 --> 24:41.366
Wait. I can still think about

24:41.401 --> 24:42.800
Mrs. Turbody when I jerk off,

24:42.835 --> 24:45.399
Right?

24:45.434 --> 24:47.101
Let me ask you somethin'. You

24:47.136 --> 24:49.618
Call her Mrs. Turbody when, you

24:49.653 --> 24:52.100
Know, you're foolin' around?

24:52.135 --> 24:53.667
Yeah.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.165
Oh...

24:55.200 --> 24:55.932
what was that?

24:55.967 --> 24:57.034
That was me almost pukin'.

24:57.069 --> 24:58.034
You happy now?

25:40.500 --> 25:42.266
And it's been 3

25:42.301 --> 25:44.450
Months since I've been sober,

25:44.485 --> 25:46.576
And he's just waitin' for me to

25:46.611 --> 25:48.522
Fail! My dad, he's just waitin'

25:48.557 --> 25:50.434
For me to fail. It's just like

25:50.469 --> 25:51.999
He always says...

25:52.034 --> 25:53.967
wow. This place is really

25:54.002 --> 25:54.918
Full of freaks, huh?

25:54.953 --> 25:55.834
Shh, come on.

25:55.869 --> 25:57.532
Sorry.

25:57.567 --> 25:58.333
All I want to do is run

25:58.368 --> 26:02.934
Out and have 3 or 4 martinis injust to k

26:02.969 --> 26:04.434
What's up?

26:04.469 --> 26:05.598
Huh?

26:05.633 --> 26:06.832
What's up?

26:06.867 --> 26:08.633
Huh? No, I just quit smokin'.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.999
Cold turkey?

26:11.034 --> 26:12.399
What do you think?

26:12.434 --> 26:13.967
I'm gonna do it, I swear

26:14.002 --> 26:14.865
To God.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.934
Why? You got some on you?

26:15.969 --> 26:16.632
No.

26:16.667 --> 26:18.484
Huh? Hey, hey, what are you

26:18.519 --> 26:20.276
Doin'? When'd you start smokin'?

26:20.311 --> 26:22.034
I think you left a pack in my

26:22.069 --> 26:23.167
Mom's room about, uh...

26:23.202 --> 26:25.984
all right.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.767
Whoo! Ha ha!

26:33.767 --> 26:35.401
Holly, hold all my calls,

26:35.436 --> 26:36.167
Please.

26:41.967 --> 26:44.767
Hello, Ms. Jones. I'm your

26:44.802 --> 26:48.151
New temp, rex longley.

26:48.186 --> 26:51.465
Rex? That rhymes with

26:51.500 --> 26:56.401
Something. Tell me. How's your

26:56.436 --> 26:59.166
Dictation?

26:59.201 --> 27:01.417
You don't mind if I put my

27:01.452 --> 27:03.633
Foot on your desk, do you?

27:15.201 --> 27:16.900
So, uh, have you given any

27:16.935 --> 27:18.600
More thought to, you know, when

27:18.635 --> 27:20.167
We might, um...

27:20.202 --> 27:21.700
tell Tommy?

27:21.735 --> 27:22.932
Yeah.

27:22.967 --> 27:25.450
No. Look, Sean, I like you.

27:25.485 --> 27:27.243
You're a great guy, and I have a

27:27.278 --> 27:29.256
Ball when I'm out with you, and

27:29.291 --> 27:30.712
In the Sack, you're a blast. But

27:30.747 --> 27:32.134
I'm not lookin' for a serious

27:32.169 --> 27:32.865
Thing.

27:32.900 --> 27:33.967
Yeah. No, no. I know. I

27:34.002 --> 27:35.401
Just--I don't know, it feels

27:35.436 --> 27:37.335
Dirty, you know? Like we're...

27:37.370 --> 27:39.118
what, cheatin' on him? It's

27:39.153 --> 27:40.643
Funny, you know, 'cause every

27:40.678 --> 27:41.939
Guy I've ever banged who was a

27:41.974 --> 27:43.171
Friend of Tommy's has said that

27:43.206 --> 27:44.368
Exact same thing to me at one

27:44.403 --> 27:46.232
Y?Int or another.

27:46.267 --> 27:47.117
Yeah. It's like you're in

27:47.152 --> 27:47.967
Love with him, and I'm your

27:48.002 --> 27:48.899
Mistress.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.032
[Laughi, no,

27:51.067 --> 27:52.717
That's not...that's not it. I

27:52.752 --> 27:54.159
Just--You know, wait a second.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.567
How many of Tommy's friends have

27:55.602 --> 27:57.067
Oh, drop it.

27:57.102 --> 27:57.699
OK.

27:57.734 --> 27:58.565
Because once we get into

27:58.600 --> 28:00.001
Numbers of any kind, then you're

28:00.036 --> 28:01.498
Gonna start thinking and

28:01.533 --> 28:03.083
Worryin' and obsessin', and then

28:03.118 --> 28:04.633
You're not gonna be able to get

28:04.668 --> 28:05.468
It up.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.900
You want me to do that toe thing

28:08.935 --> 28:09.799
Later, right?

28:09.834 --> 28:10.884
Yeah, yeah! Of course.

28:10.919 --> 28:11.934
So shut up and drink.

28:11.969 --> 28:12.699
Right.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.267
Pancho! Hey, can, uh...can we

28:15.302 --> 28:18.467
Get 2--You know what? Make it 4.

28:18.502 --> 28:21.633
4 more, please. Thanks. So, uh,

28:21.668 --> 28:24.001
You quit smokin', right?

28:24.036 --> 28:24.932
Yes.

28:24.967 --> 28:26.633
Good, 'cause I'm gonna go out

28:26.668 --> 28:27.401
And have one.

28:27.436 --> 28:27.966
OK.

28:28.001 --> 28:29.667
No, stay! Good boy.

29:09.301 --> 29:12.700
Hey. What's goin' on?

29:12.735 --> 29:13.817
How you doin'?

29:13.852 --> 29:14.843
Dami?

29:14.878 --> 29:15.799
Johnny?

29:15.834 --> 29:16.565
What's up, dami?

29:16.600 --> 29:17.633
Hey, uh, why don't you sit

29:17.668 --> 29:18.617
Down and grab yourself a coke at

29:18.652 --> 29:19.526
The bar, all right? We got some

29:19.561 --> 29:20.401
Serious stuff we gotta talk

29:20.436 --> 29:20.999
About.

29:21.034 --> 29:22.401
Oh. Divorce shit, right?

29:22.436 --> 29:23.433
Oooh!

29:23.468 --> 29:24.699
Wise ass.

29:24.734 --> 29:25.932
I'll be over there.

29:25.967 --> 29:27.967
Ahem...so what's the story

29:28.002 --> 29:28.665
With this joint?

29:28.700 --> 29:29.800
This place was grandfathered

29:29.835 --> 29:31.068
In as a smoking joint before the

29:31.103 --> 29:32.318
Mayor got his ban in, you know?

29:32.353 --> 29:33.360
I figured you'd like it. You

29:33.395 --> 29:34.368
Could smoke your ass off.

29:34.403 --> 29:35.266
I just quit.

29:35.301 --> 29:36.334
Oh, funny thing. I just

29:36.369 --> 29:37.018
Started again.

29:37.053 --> 29:37.632
Really?

29:37.667 --> 29:38.401
Yeah, I got a lot of pressure

29:38.436 --> 29:39.166
At work, you know?

29:39.201 --> 29:39.967
What the hell is he doin'

29:40.002 --> 29:40.732
Smokin', huh?

29:40.767 --> 29:42.017
It's my fault, apparently.

29:42.052 --> 29:43.292
Yeah. What isn't these days?

29:43.327 --> 29:44.533
Tell me about it. So what do

29:44.568 --> 29:45.299
We got?

29:45.334 --> 29:46.433
So Janet's not gonna go the

29:46.468 --> 29:47.468
Lawyer route, so you don't have

29:47.503 --> 29:48.468
To waste any more of your money.

29:48.503 --> 29:49.402
Like I'd be gettin' my

29:49.437 --> 29:50.266
Regular fee anyway, huh?

29:50.301 --> 29:51.701
So instead, she figured in

29:51.736 --> 29:52.885
Normally what you would've been

29:52.920 --> 29:54.034
Spending if you had hired eddie

29:54.069 --> 29:54.834
Here to represent you.

29:54.869 --> 29:55.498
Yeah?

29:55.533 --> 29:56.400
Yeah. So, Tommy, look, she's

29:56.435 --> 29:57.484
Willing to let you keep the

29:57.519 --> 29:58.593
Apartment, all right? But she

29:58.628 --> 29:59.667
Wants all the kids' clothes,

29:59.702 --> 30:00.465
She wants all the kids'

30:00.500 --> 30:01.734
Furniture, she wants the plasma

30:01.769 --> 30:03.368
TV, and she wants the car,

30:03.403 --> 30:04.533
Obviously. All right?

30:04.568 --> 30:05.299
Uh-Huh.

30:05.334 --> 30:06.134
And she wants you to cover

30:06.169 --> 30:06.934
All of her expenses and the

30:06.969 --> 30:07.700
Costs for the girls.

30:07.735 --> 30:08.565
Uh-Huh.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.667
Look, Tommy, no matter

30:09.702 --> 30:10.701
How yolook at this, you know?

30:10.736 --> 30:12.001
By not goin' through divor

30:12.036 --> 30:13.401
Court, even with my family

30:13.436 --> 30:14.518
Discount, you're savin' a

30:14.553 --> 30:15.600
Shitload of cabbage here.

30:15.635 --> 30:16.598
That's right.

30:16.633 --> 30:17.934
You guys tell her I'm keepin'

30:17.969 --> 30:18.632
The plasma.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.017
That's a smart move.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.210
You know, she figured that'd be

30:21.245 --> 30:22.368
Your first reaction, so she

30:22.403 --> 30:23.134
Ready agreed to that.

30:23.169 --> 30:23.832
Really?

30:23.867 --> 30:25.817
Guess what? Tell her I'm,

30:25.852 --> 30:28.276
Uh...I'm keepin' the master

30:28.311 --> 30:30.700
Bedroom, too. All right?

30:30.735 --> 30:31.418
No?

30:31.453 --> 30:32.143
No.

30:32.178 --> 30:32.799
No?

30:32.834 --> 30:33.884
Look, Tommy, I told her you

30:33.919 --> 30:35.010
Were sick and tired of her not,

30:35.045 --> 30:36.256
You know, returning your calls

30:36.291 --> 30:37.746
Or even taking your calls, so

30:37.781 --> 30:39.340
She's agreed, once you've agreed

30:39.375 --> 30:40.900
To all this tonight, to give you

30:40.935 --> 30:41.732
A 10-Minute face to face

30:41.767 --> 30:43.200
Tomorrow morning, after the kids

30:43.235 --> 30:44.701
Go to school. All right, Tommy,

30:44.736 --> 30:45.935
I'll double check on a time, and

30:45.970 --> 30:47.135
I'll get back to you, all ri

30:47.170 --> 30:48.301
This is total bullshit, you

30:48.336 --> 30:48.999
Know.

30:49.034 --> 30:49.917
No one's more tired of bein'

30:49.952 --> 30:51.176
In the middle of this bullshit

30:51.211 --> 30:52.439
Than me. I drop the kids off at

30:52.474 --> 30:53.704
Your place, I pick 'em up every

30:53.739 --> 30:55.036
Goddamn Sunday night. Then I

30:55.071 --> 30:56.269
Gotta listen to her go on and on

30:56.304 --> 30:57.502
About, "how's the place look? Is

30:57.537 --> 30:58.785
Tommy sleepin' in his bed? How

30:58.820 --> 31:00.377
Does Tommy look? How does dad

31:00.412 --> 31:01.934
Look?" Blah blah friggin' blah!

31:01.969 --> 31:02.732
I'm sick of it.

31:02.767 --> 31:04.450
So she asks about me.

31:04.485 --> 31:06.134
I'm gonna kill him, man.

31:06.169 --> 31:06.999
Sorry.

31:07.034 --> 31:09.334
You know what? Just tell him

31:09.369 --> 31:10.166
About teddy, OK?

31:10.201 --> 31:11.667
All right. The D.A.'S office

31:11.702 --> 31:13.068
Tells me that if he pleads

31:13.103 --> 31:14.468
Guilty, because of extenuating

31:14.503 --> 31:15.834
Circumstances, that they're

31:15.869 --> 31:16.299
Gonna be willing--

31:16.334 --> 31:18.334
Hey, is she seein' someone?

31:18.369 --> 31:20.051
The point being, that you

31:20.086 --> 31:21.926
Need to back me up tomorrow with

31:21.961 --> 31:23.481
Teddy and tell him that this

31:23.516 --> 31:25.001
Whole food allergy slash

31:25.036 --> 31:25.865
Antidepressant--

31:25.900 --> 31:27.083
You tell her I'm seein'

31:27.118 --> 31:28.267
Someone, OK? I'm seein', um...

31:28.302 --> 31:29.134
I'm seein' a

31:29.169 --> 31:29.699
Tom!

31:29.734 --> 31:30.600
I can't take this anymore,

31:30.635 --> 31:31.584
Man. I can't take this.

31:31.619 --> 31:32.510
No, wait, a dancer. A

31:32.545 --> 31:33.366
Ballerina. I'm seein' a

31:33.401 --> 31:34.633
Ballerina. Girls like her hate

31:47.335 --> 31:49.034

31:49.069 --> 31:49.967
Mind, you know that?

32:05.401 --> 32:07.550

32:29.500 --> 32:30.767
Hey.

That's so sweet!

32:46.269 --> 32:47.032

32:47.067 --> 32:48.167
I hate to say it, but I'm

32:48.202 --> 32:48.865
Glad.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.200
Yeah. Me, too.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.465
So about my dad...

32:53.500 --> 32:55.717

32:55.752 --> 32:57.934
I would come over, like, 3 hours

32:57.969 --> 32:59.834
A day? Maybe come at, like,

32:59.869 --> 33:00.498
8:00?

33:00.533 --> 33:01.600
Perfect.

33:06.101 --> 33:07.932
You look good.

33:07.967 --> 33:10.267
You smell good's what I was

33:10.302 --> 33:11.099
Gonna say.

33:11.134 --> 33:11.917
Yeah, I know.

33:11.952 --> 33:12.726
All right.

33:12.761 --> 33:13.464
See ya.

33:13.499 --> 33:14.167
Yep.

33:33.967 --> 33:35.450
So, I leave you in charge,

33:35.485 --> 33:36.934
Now the kid's havin' sex, he's

33:36.969 --> 33:37.932
Smokin', drinkin'.

33:37.967 --> 33:39.301
Whoa, whoa. Who said anything

33:39.336 --> 33:40.166
About drinkin'?

33:40.201 --> 33:41.534
When he was sittin' at the

33:41.569 --> 33:42.651
Bar, he was drinkin', OK? You

33:42.686 --> 33:43.734
Didn't even check on him.

33:43.769 --> 33:44.333
He had a coke.

33:44.368 --> 33:45.950
<i>He had a rum and coke. The</i>

33:45.985 --> 33:47.498
Broad ordered it for him.

33:47.533 --> 33:51.001
Look, you know, when we were

33:51.036 --> 33:51.665
His age--

33:51.700 --> 33:52.666
No, I know. Either one of us

33:52.701 --> 33:53.934
Would have given our left ball

33:53.969 --> 33:55.167
To get blown by a nun, never

33:55.202 --> 33:57.099
Mind be bangin' one. I

33:57.134 --> 33:58.167
Understand. I guess I should be

33:58.202 --> 34:00.232
Proud of my boy.

34:00.267 --> 34:03.433
Yeah, well, I blame the

34:03.468 --> 34:04.567
System, you know what I mean? I

34:04.602 --> 34:05.598
Mean, they get these crazy

34:05.633 --> 34:06.600
Broads in there with these crazy

34:06.635 --> 34:07.468
Agendas. They should

34:07.503 --> 34:08.318
Really--They should run

34:08.353 --> 34:09.134
Background checks on these

34:09.168 --> 34:09.667
People.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.784
Really? That's funny 'cause I

34:11.819 --> 34:13.443
Blame you. Why do you blame me?

34:13.478 --> 34:14.639
'Cause I'm dead, all right?

34:14.674 --> 34:15.800
Who the hell else am I gonna

34:15.835 --> 34:18.699
Blame? Answer this.

34:18.735 --> 34:19.831
Yeah.

34:19.867 --> 34:20.967
Look, your meeting with,

34:21.002 --> 34:22.118
Uh, Janet's set for tomorrow

34:22.152 --> 34:23.234

For me. I appreciate it. And

34:41.136 --> 34:44.299
Thanks. John?

34:44.333 --> 34:46.634
Do me a favor then?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.934
Yeah, anything.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.067
Blow me.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.651
Ahem. Let he who is

35:03.686 --> 35:06.550
Without sin St

35:06.585 --> 35:08.248

35:08.283 --> 35:10.517
Wow. I didn't know Lou was a

35:10.552 --> 35:11.484
Pink floyd fan.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.617
It was green day, asshole.

35:24.851 --> 35:26.951
Wow. That's even more

35:26.986 --> 35:27.684
Impressive.

35:31.617 --> 35:32.584
Hey.

35:50.951 --> 35:52.649
How ya doin'?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.483
Look, I know that you know

35:54.518 --> 35:56.350
About the guy that I've been

35:56.385 --> 35:57.934
Seeing, but I don't think it's

35:57.969 --> 35:59.484
Any of your business, so don't

35:59.519 --> 36:01.317
Ask me any questions.

36:04.951 --> 36:07.349
Is he a chinaman?

36:07.384 --> 36:11.484
Don't screw this up for me.

36:11.519 --> 36:15.784
You came here to talk.

36:15.819 --> 36:17.118
Yeah.

36:24.784 --> 36:27.967
You know, I, uh...I've been over

36:28.002 --> 36:31.376
This in my head so many times in

36:31.411 --> 36:34.081
The last few months. What I did

36:34.116 --> 36:35.866
Was, I responded to what I--This

36:35.901 --> 36:37.575
Is what I do at work, by the

36:37.610 --> 36:39.047
Way. I responded to what I saw.

36:39.082 --> 36:40.383
I saw the way he was on the

36:40.418 --> 36:41.649
Ground, the way his wounds

36:41.684 --> 36:44.184
Looked, OK? I--The best thing to

36:44.219 --> 36:46.051
Do was to take him then, OK? I

36:46.086 --> 36:47.468
Spoke to the guys at the local

36:47.503 --> 36:48.943
Firehouse. They said it would

36:48.978 --> 36:50.181
Have taken at least 5 or 10

36:50.216 --> 36:51.733
Minutes in traffic for them

36:51.768 --> 36:53.176
To arrive, so I did the right

36:53.211 --> 36:55.247
Thing. I did my goddamn best

36:55.282 --> 36:57.200
Under the circumstances.

36:57.235 --> 36:59.118
It wasn't enough.

37:06.018 --> 37:08.667
OK, you came to me and asked

37:08.702 --> 37:10.860
To be taken back in. You asked

37:10.895 --> 37:12.856
Me for a second chance, OK? I

37:12.891 --> 37:14.537
Gave you what you asked for, all

37:14.572 --> 37:15.811
Right? If there's blood on my

37:15.846 --> 37:17.531
Hands, there's blood on your

37:17.566 --> 37:18.958
Hands, too. Till death do us

37:18.993 --> 37:20.350
Part. Remember that? Who said

37:20.385 --> 37:21.616
That? Huh?

37:21.651 --> 37:23.517
So I was psychic. Who knew?

37:39.917 --> 37:44.717
Put the rest on my tab. You know the

37:44.752 --> 37:46.484
To come out of this is that now

37:46.519 --> 37:48.651
I don't have to watch Connor

37:48.686 --> 37:50.784
Grow up and turn out exactly

37:50.819 --> 37:52.084
Like you.

38:03.118 --> 38:04.517
Get out of there! Find

38:04.552 --> 38:05.917
The one down the hall. Anybody

38:05.952 --> 38:08.384
Here?! Hello! Hello!

38:08.419 --> 38:10.716
Lou?

38:10.751 --> 38:12.217
Come on! What do you got,

38:12.252 --> 38:12.884
A problem?

38:19.450 --> 38:20.549
Ready?

38:20.584 --> 38:25.584
Yeah! FDNY! Anybody home?!

38:35.584 --> 38:37.550
Hey, Lou!

39:05.584 --> 39:06.849
There you go.

39:06.884 --> 39:10.617
Hey, sweetheart. Hey. Yeah.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.450
There you go. All right.

39:38.183 --> 39:39.183
Jesus! That was a bitch,

39:39.218 --> 39:39.716
Huh?

39:39.751 --> 39:40.450
I almost puked on the

39:40.485 --> 39:40.882
Third floor.

39:40.917 --> 39:41.884
That's that sausage and

39:41.919 --> 39:42.885
Pepper sandwich comin' back.

39:42.920 --> 39:43.885
No, it was that old b

39:43.920 --> 39:44.851
I saved. She shit her pants on

39:44.886 --> 39:45.549
The way down.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.384
That's why they make

39:46.419 --> 39:46.983
Depends.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.001
Jesus, it's cold for this

39:48.036 --> 39:48.943
Shit, huh? Should make a law

39:48.978 --> 39:49.851
That says you can only burn your

39:49.886 --> 39:50.782
House down in the summer.

39:50.817 --> 39:51.751
Wait, wait. What did you

39:51.786 --> 39:52.182
Say?

39:52.217 --> 39:53.034
I said it's too cold for

39:53.069 --> 39:53.851
This shit. They should make a

39:53.886 --> 39:54.482
Law that says...

39:54.517 --> 39:55.384
you just had...you just had a

39:55.419 --> 39:56.049
Cigarette, didn't you?

39:56.084 --> 39:57.051
What the hell are you talkin'

39:57.086 --> 39:57.682
About?

39:57.717 --> 39:58.567
You just had a cigarette.

39:58.602 --> 39:59.417
I did not. Why would you say

40:00.084 --> 40:00.849
I'll tell you why

40:00.884 --> 40:01.984
Garrity...because this nose, OK?

40:02.019 --> 40:03.484
Is the FDNY's version of a

40:03.519 --> 40:04.016
Connoisseur.

40:04.051 --> 40:04.816
It's true.

40:04.851 --> 40:06.617
It has smelled every possible

40:06.652 --> 40:09.034
Type of smoke that a nose can,

40:09.069 --> 40:10.993
OK? This nose, when it comes to

40:11.028 --> 40:14.222
Smoke, is the be all and the end

40:14.257 --> 40:17.417
All, and you have just smoked...

40:17.452 --> 40:19.083
a parliament.

40:19.118 --> 40:20.118
Oh, man, he's good.

40:20.153 --> 40:20.816
Holy shit.

40:20.851 --> 40:21.784
How didou know what brand

40:21.819 --> 40:22.482
It was?

40:22.517 --> 40:24.417
I saw the same box lyin' on

40:24.452 --> 40:25.382
The ground as he did.

40:25.417 --> 40:26.250
Hey, that's 50 bucks he's

40:26.285 --> 40:26.916
Gotta put in the kitty.

40:26.951 --> 40:28.267
50 this time, 100 the next

40:28.302 --> 40:29.584
Time. That's what the deal is.

40:29.619 --> 40:31.816
It's 100.

40:31.851 --> 40:33.217
I was just talkin' to her.

40:43.951 --> 40:45.684
Hey, man, she's gone.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.182
OK, come on.

40:47.217 --> 40:48.450
