00:12.200 --> 00:14.728
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.824 --> 00:18.376
Just hear me out.
You used up the public's goodwill with Sherry.

00:18.472 --> 00:21.928
They don't want to hear about your being involved
with someone else who's not trustworthy.

00:22.025 --> 00:24.712
You have got to respect the people
who voted for you.

00:24.808 --> 00:28.585
Her ex-husband clearly had his own agenda.
It shouldn't be difficult to prove he's a liar.

00:28.681 --> 00:32.872
Anne, it's me, Ted. I'm up in my office.
Come up and I'll explain everything.

00:32.969 --> 00:35.913
I have some documents
that'll prove your innocence.

00:36.008 --> 00:39.305
- Kim, it's me. Are you alone?
- "Where are you?"
Chappelle ordered you back here.

00:39.433 --> 00:43.112
I'm not coming back until I find your father.
I just found out where Hector Salazar is.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.032
A small town in northern Mexico
called Las Nieves.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.977
- I'm sure Jack's taking Ramon there now.
- You cannot go in there alone.

00:48.073 --> 00:49.897
Hector's gonna have
an army down there.

00:49.993 --> 00:52.809
Kim, I need to hear you promise me you're
not gonna tell anyone you talked to me.

00:52.906 --> 00:54.697
Be careful, Chase.

00:54.794 --> 00:58.409
- What are you doing, Jack?
- "Your brother tried to kill me on the plane!"

00:58.505 --> 01:01.066
That is not what we talked about!

01:02.185 --> 01:04.072
My brother.
I'm so glad to see you.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.442
What's going on?
I don't understand.

01:06.538 --> 01:09.450
I'll tell you in a minute.
I promise.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.906
Good job, Jack. Come.

01:13.002 --> 01:15.594
We have a lot of work to do.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.514
- Where's Chappelle?
- Interrogation 820.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.178
Let's go.

01:19.274 --> 01:21.610
Talk to me, you son of a bitch.
Almeida, what are you doing here?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.946
- Get him out of the room.
- " Why?"

01:26.858 --> 01:29.099
- He's in.
- What are you talking about?

01:29.194 --> 01:31.914
- Who's in?
- Jack. Gael and I have been working with Jack.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.218
We've been trying to get him back
undercover with the Salazars.

01:34.313 --> 01:36.938
- That signal means he's back in.
- I don't understand.

01:37.034 --> 01:40.138
Look. I'll explain everything.
Right now we gotta call the president.

01:42.762 --> 01:47.594
The following takes place
between 8.'00 p.m. And 9.'00 p.m.

01:47.754 --> 01:51.595
So, you're telling me that Bauer's
been playing a game with us all this time.

01:51.691 --> 01:53.547
It's no game, Ryan.

01:53.643 --> 01:56.267
But he's back under with the Salazars,
and they trust him again.

01:56.363 --> 01:58.731
That's what
we're counting on, yeah.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.603
I'm your boss, Tony.
You should have come to me first.

02:02.699 --> 02:06.860
Look, Ryan. You'll understand everything
once I've explained it to the president.

02:06.955 --> 02:10.826
After that, if you feel like I've acted
inappropriately, you can do what you gotta do.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.931
I will. Count on it.

02:15.371 --> 02:17.196
The president's coming on the line.

02:17.291 --> 02:20.588
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, Mr. Almeida.

02:20.716 --> 02:24.427
Mr. President, this is Tony Almeida,
Director of C.T.U., Los Angeles.

02:24.523 --> 02:27.979
- Mr. Almeida.
- "Thank you for taking my call, Mr. President."

02:28.076 --> 02:31.532
You're also on
with my chief of staff, Wayne Palmer.

02:31.628 --> 02:33.612
I was told
this is an urgent matter.

02:33.707 --> 02:35.532
Yes, sir, it is.
It's also fairly complex...

02:35.627 --> 02:38.251
so I'll try to keep it
as clear and concise as I can.

02:38.348 --> 02:39.980
Go on.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.957
Sir, everything that's happened today from
the infected body at Health Services...

02:43.052 --> 02:47.595
to Ramon Salazar's prison break
has been part of an elaborate sting operation.

02:47.692 --> 02:51.372
- Sting operation?
- "Yes, sir. Planned and executed by Jack Bauer..."

02:51.468 --> 02:53.677
Agent Gael Ortega and myself.

02:53.772 --> 02:55.308
Elaborate, Mr. Almeida.

02:55.404 --> 02:58.028
Jack Bauer wanted to fill you in
on the situation himself, sir.

02:58.124 --> 03:01.196
Jack Bauer is
a fugitive from the law.

03:01.292 --> 03:05.068
If you'll indulge me, sir,
there's a video file you should see.

03:05.165 --> 03:07.309
It's on a designated C.T.U. Server.

03:07.405 --> 03:11.884
You can access the file with
the pass code Delta-3-Delta-59.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.741
Mr. President...

03:17.837 --> 03:19.821
the fact that you're reviewing
this recording now means...

03:19.917 --> 03:23.116
that I have successfully completed
the first phase of a secret operation.

03:23.213 --> 03:25.036
Contrary to what you've
been led to believe...

03:25.133 --> 03:27.821
the Salazars are not in possession
of the Cordilla virus.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.573
The idea that they are
is a lie which I promoted deliberately...

03:30.670 --> 03:33.453
in order to achieve
a more important goal.

03:33.550 --> 03:36.653
Please, sir, let me explain.

03:36.749 --> 03:39.629
About a month ago, I learned from a contact
that a group of scientists from the Ukraine...

03:39.726 --> 03:42.606
were trying to sell a weaponized virus
on the open market.

03:42.702 --> 03:45.710
They were looking for a buyer
with cash and credibility.

03:45.806 --> 03:49.390
I only managed to get their interest when
I suggested the Salazars as potential buyers.

03:49.486 --> 03:52.046
As long as I could get
the Salazars to agree...

03:52.141 --> 03:54.638
C.T.U. Would seize the virus
as the sale took place.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.030
Our goal was to remove
the virus stockpile from the marketplace.

03:58.127 --> 04:00.398
Because, Mr. President,
it is without a doubt...

04:00.493 --> 04:04.013
the most lethal threat
that we have ever faced.

04:04.110 --> 04:08.143
But all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.

04:08.238 --> 04:10.127
And the only way
to gain their trust...

04:10.222 --> 04:12.429
was to break Ramon Salazar
out of prison.

04:12.526 --> 04:16.430
Mr. President,
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

04:16.527 --> 04:18.894
But I assure you,
it was a benign deception.

04:19.023 --> 04:22.959
And I assume complete
responsibility for my actions.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.583
Sir, if things went wrong,
you would have been exposed personally...

04:25.678 --> 04:27.503
legally and politically.

04:27.598 --> 04:30.223
And this was the only way
I could see to avoid that risk.

04:30.319 --> 04:32.463
But now it's time
for you to know the truth.

04:32.559 --> 04:35.695
And I'm asking you to allow
C.T.U. Director Almeida to coordinate...

04:35.790 --> 04:39.663
an interdiction with the military,
so we can take possession of this virus...

04:39.759 --> 04:41.583
and keep it from our enemies.

04:41.679 --> 04:44.016
Thank you, Mr. President.

04:46.383 --> 04:49.487
Mr. President?

04:49.583 --> 04:54.288
Keeping me in the dark on a matter
of national security is inexcusable.

04:54.383 --> 04:56.272
We were trying to protect you, sir.

04:56.367 --> 05:00.623
I know what you were trying to do,
and it was a mistake.

05:00.719 --> 05:04.367
And you and your colleagues will take
responsibility for it when this is over.

05:04.463 --> 05:07.056
- Yes, sir, I understand.
- Where's Bauer now?

05:07.152 --> 05:09.200
In northern Mexico.
He's setting up a meeting...

05:09.296 --> 05:12.337
between the Salazars and the Ukrainians
who are selling the virus.

05:12.432 --> 05:15.472
When is this meeting
expected to take place?

05:15.568 --> 05:18.864
In the next few hours, sir.
Mr. President...

05:18.960 --> 05:22.192
I'm requesting your permission
to activate the interdiction plan.

05:22.289 --> 05:26.192
Under the circumstances, I don't have
a choice but to say yes, Mr. Almeida.

05:26.287 --> 05:28.912
But even if this plan
works flawlessly...

05:29.008 --> 05:30.832
you haven't heard the last of it.

05:35.344 --> 05:37.712
I don't like decisions
being taken out of my hands.

05:37.808 --> 05:41.808
Well, David, some decisions you wanna
keep as far away from as you can.

05:41.904 --> 05:44.177
Not this decision.
It's too important.

05:44.273 --> 05:46.577
Jack Bauer had no right
to keep me out of the loop.

05:46.673 --> 05:50.353
I disagree.
Bauer protected you as he should have.

05:50.449 --> 05:53.424
Now when this is all over, you're probably
gonna have to punish him for form's sake.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.049
But while
you're punishing him, know this.

05:56.145 --> 05:58.097
He did do the right thing.

06:09.841 --> 06:12.402
Michelle.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.985
We need an extended network
using protocol four, all right?

06:16.081 --> 06:17.905
Thanks.

06:22.162 --> 06:26.034
I'm not so sure this is gonna
work out well for you, Almeida.

06:26.130 --> 06:29.778
Maybe not. But right now
I gotta help Jack get this virus.

06:29.873 --> 06:31.986
And I don't need you
looking over my shoulder, all right?

06:32.082 --> 06:35.571
You work for me.
You don't give orders; you take them.

06:35.666 --> 06:39.601
Yeah. Except the president put me
in charge of this particular operation.

06:39.698 --> 06:42.450
Now, if you object,
give him a call.

06:42.546 --> 06:45.074
I may be wrong, but I didn't get
the impression that he's in the mood...

06:45.170 --> 06:47.155
for any bureaucratic
squabbling today.

06:49.299 --> 06:53.778
Ryan, just let me
do my job, all right?

06:55.859 --> 06:57.907
Yeah, I'll be watching.

07:23.636 --> 07:25.780
Are you ready to listen, Ramon?

07:27.667 --> 07:29.491
All right.

07:29.587 --> 07:32.787
Tell me how the man
who betrayed us is now our friend.

07:34.356 --> 07:36.788
Bauer came to me
with an opportunity.

07:36.884 --> 07:38.740
- An opportunity?
- Yes.

07:38.836 --> 07:41.971
To make more money
than we have ever dreamed of.

07:44.244 --> 07:46.228
Bauer found out about a virus
that was coming in the market.

07:46.323 --> 07:48.148
These men who have it,
they are from the Ukraine.

07:48.244 --> 07:50.548
They're scientists.
All they want to do...

07:50.644 --> 07:52.980
is to make their money
and disappear.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.660
How much are they asking?

07:56.756 --> 07:59.316
A hundred million.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.653
Al Qaeda will pay us ten times as much.
North Koreans too.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.893
I made all the calls, Ramon.
I have the buyers all lined up.

08:03.989 --> 08:05.780
That's a billion dollars.

08:11.093 --> 08:13.140
How do you know
this virus is real?

08:13.237 --> 08:16.500
The Ukrainians
gave us a demonstration.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.924
Bauer delivered one of the bodies
to Health Services in L.A.

08:20.053 --> 08:22.581
He used it to scare the Americans
into letting you go.

08:22.677 --> 08:24.853
The scientists,
where are they now?

08:24.949 --> 08:26.837
They're not far from here.

08:26.934 --> 08:29.077
I'm supposed to call
their representative...

08:29.173 --> 08:31.605
a man named Michael Amador,
in the next hour.

08:34.197 --> 08:36.373
What's in it for you, Jack?

08:36.469 --> 08:38.134
$50 million.

08:38.230 --> 08:41.172
Ramon, we don't like each other.

08:41.269 --> 08:43.989
But it doesn't mean
we can't do business together.

08:44.085 --> 08:48.277
I need your capital,
and you need my access to the virus.

08:50.294 --> 08:53.589
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.462
And I am not that sure now.

08:57.558 --> 09:00.630
A few years ago, my wife
was killed because of my job.

09:00.726 --> 09:02.902
My daughter's never been
the same since.

09:02.998 --> 09:05.335
This last year? Well...

09:05.430 --> 09:07.349
you know what I went through
to bring you in.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.398
What did I get for it?

09:09.494 --> 09:14.102
A pat on the back?
In the end, a demotion and a heroin habit.

09:16.438 --> 09:19.190
I'm tired of putting
my ass on the line for nothing.

09:19.286 --> 09:22.999
I'm done putting
my ass on the line for nothing.

09:28.023 --> 09:30.102
If you don't want to
go through with it...

09:32.055 --> 09:34.551
blow him away.

09:34.647 --> 09:39.479
But just remember,
you're blowing away a billion dollars.

09:46.326 --> 09:48.439
Ramon, no!

09:48.535 --> 09:52.120
- Are you crazy?
- You are crazy for trusting him.

09:53.495 --> 09:55.382
- Give me the gun.
- No.

09:57.143 --> 09:59.031
Who are you to refuse me?

09:59.159 --> 10:01.112
I run our business, not you!

10:01.207 --> 10:04.504
If not for me... me...
you wouldn't even be here!

10:04.632 --> 10:06.456
Like I said...

10:08.343 --> 10:10.231
I have to call him
within an hour.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.160
These men are not gonna wait around.
There's too much at stake.

10:16.696 --> 10:19.224
You can either shoot me,
or let me make the call.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.432
But you'd better decide quickly.

10:35.736 --> 10:39.000
Jack's transponder pinpoints his location
somewhere east of Las Nieves...

10:39.097 --> 10:41.305
just south of the border.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.352
Satellite photos show
that it's some sort of ranch or farm.

10:48.952 --> 10:52.121
Our units will hold
a perimeter of 10 miles.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.041
All communication will be
on a designated frequency...

10:54.137 --> 10:56.696
and nobody makes a move
unless it goes through me first, all right?

10:56.792 --> 10:59.161
Chloe, I want you and Chase
to provide tactical assistance.

10:59.256 --> 11:02.105
- Where is Chase?
- "We're not sure."

11:02.201 --> 11:04.473
Chappelle ordered him back
over an hour ago.

11:04.569 --> 11:06.393
All right, let me know
when he gets back here.

11:06.489 --> 11:08.600
Now, let me make this
perfectly clear.

11:08.697 --> 11:10.777
For the next few hours,
all of our resources are dedicated...

11:10.872 --> 11:12.953
to helping Jack Bauer
intercept this virus.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.417
Any questions?

11:15.513 --> 11:17.562
All right,
let's get back to work.

11:26.490 --> 11:28.826
Tony.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.706
- I spoke to Chase.
- When?

11:31.803 --> 11:34.521
About an hour ago.
He is not coming back to C.T.U.

11:34.618 --> 11:36.922
What are you talking about?
Chappelle gave him a direct order.

11:37.017 --> 11:39.386
He ignored it.
He still doesn't really know what's going on.

11:39.514 --> 11:41.658
None of us did
until you spoke to the president.

11:41.755 --> 11:44.122
Chase still thinks
my father was captured by the Salazars.

11:44.218 --> 11:46.458
And he thinks he's going in
to rescue Jack.

11:46.554 --> 11:50.298
Yes. He knows about Las Nieves. He's on his
way there right now. Probably by plane.

11:50.394 --> 11:53.915
- How the hell did he find out about Las Nieves?
- He said he followed a lead.

11:54.011 --> 11:57.594
Damn it. If he goes in there, he's gonna blow
Jack's cover, and we're gonna lose this virus.

11:57.690 --> 11:59.514
- I know.
- All right. Maybe I can get a hold of him.

11:59.610 --> 12:02.075
Tony, you won't
be able to reach him.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.474
- Why not?
- He's gone dark.

12:25.371 --> 12:28.220
Hector thought
you might be hungry.

12:34.651 --> 12:37.467
Look at you.
You're pathetic.

12:37.564 --> 12:40.027
You're still a junkie, aren't you?

12:40.124 --> 12:44.572
It's the only real thing about you.

12:44.668 --> 12:48.443
It makes me sick to think
that I ever believed you.

12:48.572 --> 12:51.515
You said you'd take me away from here.
Remember?

12:52.796 --> 12:55.100
Do you remember, Jack?

12:56.637 --> 12:58.844
Yes, I remember.

12:58.939 --> 13:01.243
But there was one small thing
you forgot to mention.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.260
You were a cop.

13:03.356 --> 13:06.428
But even that wouldn't matter if you'd meant
half the things you said to me.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.541
I meant everything
I ever said to you.

13:08.636 --> 13:10.875
Do you think I am stupid?

13:10.972 --> 13:12.797
You were doing a job.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.876
My compliments.
You did it very well.

13:14.972 --> 13:18.044
But you know
the saddest thing, Jack?

13:18.141 --> 13:20.285
You couldn't even be true to that.

13:20.381 --> 13:22.845
You betrayed Hector and Ramon.

13:22.941 --> 13:26.557
You betrayed me.
And now you betray your own people.

13:26.653 --> 13:29.596
God knows there are times
when I despise Hector...

13:29.693 --> 13:31.581
but at least he is true to himself.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.334
He knows who he is. You?

13:34.429 --> 13:36.380
You're a man without a soul.

13:39.869 --> 13:42.430
Does Hector know about us?

13:42.525 --> 13:44.509
Do you think
I'd be alive if he did?

13:46.141 --> 13:48.669
You know where he is right now?

13:48.765 --> 13:50.941
He's with Ramon...

13:51.037 --> 13:53.245
deciding whether
you should live or die...

13:53.342 --> 13:56.862
while you sit here
shaking like a leaf.

14:02.557 --> 14:05.405
You need a fix, don't you?

14:05.502 --> 14:08.062
Well, there's plenty here, Jack.

14:08.158 --> 14:11.582
Want me to get you a fix?
Is that what you want?

14:11.678 --> 14:13.501
No.

14:16.126 --> 14:17.950
Jack.

14:18.046 --> 14:21.119
You were a man once.

14:21.214 --> 14:23.870
What happened to you?

14:42.558 --> 14:45.535
- All right, I'm sending his photo to you right now.
- "Okay."

14:45.631 --> 14:48.831
Now remember, Miguel,
this guy's acting on his own authority.

14:48.927 --> 14:50.910
Make sure you tell Gutierrez
that he's armed and dangerous.

14:51.006 --> 14:53.695
- Okay. He'll confirm with you.
- Yeah. All right, good.

15:46.209 --> 15:48.320
I just spoke to my contact
in Mexican Intelligence.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.624
He says he can get a man
to Las Nieves in 20 minutes...

15:50.720 --> 15:54.113
- an agent named Rafael Gutierrez.
- Won't local police be quicker?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.609
If we bring them in, we might as well
send a telegram to the Salazars...

15:56.736 --> 15:59.361
- that Chase is on his way.
- What about our Delta teams?

15:59.457 --> 16:01.473
No. It's gonna take them over an hour.
It'll be way too late.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.192
We're analyzing
the aerial map of Las Nieves.

16:04.289 --> 16:06.657
- There's only one landing strip.
- He won't use it.

16:06.752 --> 16:09.953
Landing strip's too exposed.
Especially if it's the only one.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.954
All right,
run a topographical overlay.

16:14.050 --> 16:16.225
Find the most likely
landing area besides the airfield.

16:19.841 --> 16:22.049
Yes, David?

16:22.146 --> 16:24.225
Have you seen or heard from Anne?

16:24.322 --> 16:26.913
- Not for some time. Why?
- I can't reach her.

16:27.009 --> 16:30.049
- Is this about your health?
- No. I'm concerned about her.

16:30.145 --> 16:32.450
She was pretty ripped up
after the debate.

16:32.545 --> 16:34.562
We're all pretty
ripped up here, David.

16:34.658 --> 16:37.122
Listen, this allegation
by Anne's ex-husband...

16:37.218 --> 16:39.042
is no small bump in the road.

16:39.137 --> 16:41.474
Now, I've been thinking about this,
and there may be no way...

16:41.569 --> 16:43.553
to defend ourselves
against Keeler's accusation...

16:43.650 --> 16:45.890
that Anne was involved
in something illegal.

16:45.986 --> 16:48.611
You have to do
better than that, Wayne.

16:48.706 --> 16:50.755
I know you like to
deal with things head-on...

16:50.851 --> 16:54.402
but I think the best course of action
for right now is to be evasive.

16:54.498 --> 16:56.770
So, if the press brings this up,
you make it clear...

16:56.866 --> 16:58.690
that you're not going to
answer any questions...

16:58.786 --> 17:01.443
that you're gonna wait
for all the facts to come in, as should they.

17:01.539 --> 17:05.314
Well, you may be right, but in the meantime,
I need you to find Anne.

17:05.442 --> 17:09.122
The reporters are gonna be chasing her,
and she's not up to this.

17:09.219 --> 17:11.555
I'll put Perry on it.

17:11.651 --> 17:15.396
Thank you.

17:33.059 --> 17:35.203
Hello, Anne.

17:35.299 --> 17:37.187
Thanks for coming.

17:43.843 --> 17:47.236
I just wanted to have a chance
to apologize face-to-face for what I did.

17:47.332 --> 17:50.020
I don't know what I was thinking.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.036
Where are the letters, Ted?

17:54.275 --> 17:56.163
They're right here.

18:07.684 --> 18:11.172
For God's sake, Anne.
It's not meant for you.

18:11.268 --> 18:13.093
Well, for whom then?

18:13.188 --> 18:14.916
Just take the letters and go.

18:15.013 --> 18:17.731
Ted, you're not thinking
about killing yourself.

18:17.828 --> 18:19.812
No, no. It's for self-defense.

18:19.908 --> 18:21.572
Don't lie to me.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.685
Look, you got
what you came for, so go.

18:23.781 --> 18:25.605
You don't need
to be here for this.

18:25.701 --> 18:29.093
Ted, at least talk to someone.

18:29.189 --> 18:31.364
I know some good doctors.

18:31.461 --> 18:34.757
High-priced phonies who are gonna talk me
out of what I should have done five years ago?

18:34.852 --> 18:37.093
No, thank you.

18:44.453 --> 18:46.277
I'm a failure, Anne.

18:46.373 --> 18:49.989
Everything I touch goes bad.
It's just the way it is.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.446
Don't shed any tears for me
because I don't deserve it.

18:53.541 --> 18:55.365
Just... Just go.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.478
Don't come any closer.

19:11.174 --> 19:13.189
- Let me call someone.
- No!

19:13.286 --> 19:15.590
- Please.
- Now, you're a great woman, Anne.

19:15.686 --> 19:17.639
Much better than I ever deserved.

19:17.734 --> 19:20.518
And I'm sorry I let you down,
but just get the hell outta here.

19:22.342 --> 19:24.998
I said go!

19:25.095 --> 19:29.670
Ted, it doesn't
have to be like this.

19:29.767 --> 19:33.446
No? How can it be?
Can we be 25 again?

19:34.630 --> 19:37.158
What you did was wrong.

19:37.255 --> 19:39.815
But you made it right.

19:39.911 --> 19:42.471
And that means something.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.455
That means you can start again.

19:46.182 --> 19:48.583
People do it all the time, Ted.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.815
Why not you?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.191
You're really something.

20:02.727 --> 20:04.615
I believe if I gave you
a few more minutes...

20:04.744 --> 20:07.687
you might actually be able
to talk me out of doing it.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.055
Ted.

20:20.711 --> 20:23.655
No!

20:41.352 --> 20:43.977
The president can expect
updates directly from me.

20:44.073 --> 20:45.896
- How often will you call in?
- Every 15 minutes.

20:45.992 --> 20:49.192
- I'll let him know.
- All right. We'll be in touch.

20:55.113 --> 20:57.448
You should be in the hospital.

20:59.016 --> 21:01.960
I'm fine.
What do you got?

21:02.057 --> 21:04.713
Briefing package on Las Nieves.

21:04.809 --> 21:08.553
Alternate landing sites that Chase
might use instead of the airstrip.

21:08.650 --> 21:11.048
Thanks.

21:14.569 --> 21:16.585
Is there something wrong?

21:16.681 --> 21:18.569
Just worried about you.
That's all.

21:20.586 --> 21:24.201
Uh-huh. What is it?

21:26.378 --> 21:28.841
- It's not the time.
- "Michelle."

21:30.633 --> 21:32.458
What is it?

21:35.081 --> 21:37.097
This whole thing that
you've been planning with Jack...

21:38.153 --> 21:41.994
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

21:42.122 --> 21:44.970
Jack planned it.
He wanted absolute secrecy, and I agreed.

21:45.066 --> 21:46.889
You don't have to explain.

21:46.986 --> 21:48.809
No, I wanna explain.
Listen to me.

21:49.866 --> 21:52.266
I trust you with my life.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.498
But this job is what it is.

22:07.754 --> 22:10.922
Jack said he came up with the plan
a month ago. Is that how long you've known?

22:11.978 --> 22:14.602
Something like that.
Yeah.

22:15.659 --> 22:17.547
I just...

22:17.675 --> 22:19.755
I had no "idea..."

22:19.851 --> 22:23.594
you were hiding
something from me.

22:25.131 --> 22:27.659
But that's my problem.

22:43.532 --> 22:45.356
Just got off the phone
with C.T.U.

22:45.452 --> 22:48.715
Bauer's near a place
called Las Nieves.

22:48.811 --> 22:51.019
Delta teams are scrambling now.

22:51.115 --> 22:54.316
When does C.T.U. expect
to intercept the virus from the Ukrainians?

22:54.412 --> 22:56.428
As soon as Bauer gives them a signal.

22:56.524 --> 22:59.819
Tony Almeida says he'll be giving us
an update every 15 minutes.

22:59.948 --> 23:02.156
- Good.
- This is Wayne Palmer.

23:02.252 --> 23:06.156
Yeah. Yeah, hang on.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.420
David, it's Anne.
She says it's important.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.756
- Hello, Anne?
- David, it's Ted.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.124
He just committed suicide.

23:18.220 --> 23:21.644
Oh, Anne. I-I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

23:21.741 --> 23:24.460
Not really, no.
I was, uh...

23:24.556 --> 23:26.765
I was with him when he did it.

23:26.860 --> 23:29.645
- What were you doing there?
- He asked to see me, David.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.525
He said that he was sorry and that
he wanted to make things right, and l...

23:32.620 --> 23:34.829
Did you call the police?

23:34.925 --> 23:37.292
- Yes. Yeah, they're here now.
- What can I do to help?

23:37.421 --> 23:41.261
Well, there's something I need to give you.
Something Ted wanted me to give you.

23:41.389 --> 23:43.021
What's that?

23:43.117 --> 23:45.837
It's letters that, um, exonerate me
from any connection...

23:45.933 --> 23:47.757
to the falsified research data.

23:47.853 --> 23:50.573
That's why I was here in the first place,
because he wanted to give them to me.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.733
- And you have these letters?
- Yes, I do.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.038
So, I'll be in the clear and...

23:57.133 --> 23:59.950
hopefully it puts an end
to the negative fallout for you as well.

24:00.045 --> 24:02.413
That's secondary
to your well-being.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.742
I'll be okay.

24:05.837 --> 24:07.789
I'll come over
as soon as I'm done here.

24:07.918 --> 24:09.934
Good. I'll see you then.

24:10.029 --> 24:11.854
Okay.

24:22.382 --> 24:24.878
Is everything all right?

24:24.974 --> 24:27.181
Ted Packard
just committed suicide.

24:27.278 --> 24:29.389
And he did it in front of Anne.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.847
My God, David.
I'm so sorry.

24:35.310 --> 24:38.254
Listen, I don't mean to...
I don't mean to sound callous...

24:38.350 --> 24:40.878
but what was
she doing with him?

24:40.975 --> 24:43.118
He wanted to give her letters...

24:43.215 --> 24:45.582
which apparently prove
she's innocent.

24:45.711 --> 24:47.535
You serious?

24:47.631 --> 24:49.646
She's gonna bring them over
in a little while.

24:51.599 --> 24:54.638
Well, I guess that's
some sort of silver lining. It...

24:56.239 --> 24:59.984
Listen, David. I know I've been
somewhat hard on Anne.

25:00.079 --> 25:02.446
But she cleaned up
her own mess...

25:02.543 --> 25:04.367
and I respect that.

25:04.463 --> 25:07.663
Maybe she's learning what it takes
to be in this game after all.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.407
Why do we even need Bauer?

25:19.503 --> 25:21.488
He made the first contact
with the Ukrainian scientists.

25:21.584 --> 25:23.888
- They want to deal with him. They trust him.
- You trust him too.

25:23.984 --> 25:26.447
The man who pretended to be our friend,
and then put me in prison.

25:26.543 --> 25:29.040
- And got you out again.
- He has an angle, Hector.

25:29.135 --> 25:31.119
- Count on it.
- Of course he does.

25:31.216 --> 25:33.328
$50 million is a big angle.

25:35.344 --> 25:38.416
You saw him. He's a shell.
There's nothing left.

25:38.512 --> 25:41.679
No future, no family,
and a habit he can't beat.

25:41.776 --> 25:45.040
He's not the same man
who fooled us before.

25:45.136 --> 25:47.600
You're so sure of that, huh?

25:47.697 --> 25:49.873
You know we have people
in the American agencies.

25:49.969 --> 25:52.464
In the military too.
All of them, every one of them...

25:52.560 --> 25:54.384
confirm the prison break was real!

25:54.480 --> 25:57.264
Bauer is a fugitive
from his own country.

25:57.361 --> 26:00.849
If they hadn't wanted you alive,
they would have killed him. That's a fact.

26:00.945 --> 26:05.328
So, if we go through with this,
what happens afterwards?

26:05.424 --> 26:08.208
We just forget what Bauer did to us
and let him walk away?

26:08.305 --> 26:11.057
Do you think I could forget
what he did to us?

26:11.153 --> 26:13.361
As soon as we have the virus...

26:13.457 --> 26:15.505
we kill him.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.904
Now, that's the first thing
you said that I like.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.905
Now, Bauer is clever.
He will expect it.

26:22.001 --> 26:24.530
What can he do alone, surrounded?

26:24.625 --> 26:27.026
Don't underestimate him.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.329
It's me who's been
underestimated, Ramon.

26:29.424 --> 26:31.985
But I will earn your respect...

26:32.081 --> 26:35.249
when we make more money in one day
than we've made in both of our lifetimes.

26:36.306 --> 26:38.418
But you don't have
all night to decide.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.329
This man Amador
is waiting for Bauer's call.

26:47.602 --> 26:49.458
Bring Bauer in.

26:49.554 --> 26:51.955
Right away, Ramon.

26:55.186 --> 26:57.842
What have you decided, Ramon?

26:57.938 --> 27:00.659
I'm not sure yet.

27:17.234 --> 27:19.890
I don't trust you,
and I never will.

27:21.042 --> 27:24.531
All I want right now
is to spill your blood.

27:24.626 --> 27:26.707
But I won't.
Not yet anyway.

27:26.803 --> 27:28.978
Out of respect for my little brother...

27:29.074 --> 27:31.923
I am willing to play this out
a little longer.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.827
So, make your call.

27:35.923 --> 27:39.251
Amador won't be at the number
he gave me for another 15 minutes.

27:39.380 --> 27:41.107
We'll wait.

27:41.203 --> 27:43.026
You won't be sorry.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.804
Tony, it's Rafael from Las Nieves.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.564
Will you patch it over here?

28:14.356 --> 28:17.172
- Yeah, Rafael.
- Yeah, I'm at the landing area now.

28:17.268 --> 28:19.091
There's no sign
of any incoming craft.

28:19.187 --> 28:20.980
What size team do you have?

28:21.076 --> 28:23.124
What team? It's just me.

28:23.220 --> 28:24.980
You gotta be kidding me.

28:25.076 --> 28:26.900
Look, this is a corrupt area.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.780
Salazar's got a lot of influence here.
We don't know how far it reaches.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.796
Miguel wanted me
to do this on my own.

28:31.924 --> 28:33.748
All right, well,
you're gonna have your hands full...

28:33.844 --> 28:35.797
'cause Chase is one of
our more capable agents.

28:35.924 --> 28:38.293
All right. How do you
want me to approach?

28:38.421 --> 28:41.845
Well, don't surprise him. Make sure
he knows you're working with C.T.U.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.389
Hang on. I hear something.

28:54.518 --> 28:57.045
Yeah, this must be him.

28:58.101 --> 29:00.501
It's a twin-engine prop
on approach.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.093
He's landing now.

29:12.405 --> 29:14.774
- Do you have the photo we sent you?
- "Yeah."

29:14.870 --> 29:17.238
Make sure it's him,
and be careful.

29:17.334 --> 29:20.469
- We'll keep this line open.
- Good.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.742
All right.
I'm moving in.

29:50.838 --> 29:54.135
All right, be careful.
He's not expecting company.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.663
Edmunds.

30:02.038 --> 30:04.439
Edmunds, I'm here to help.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.335
Edmunds.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.255
Edmunds!

30:16.504 --> 30:18.871
Edmunds.

30:22.903 --> 30:26.104
- Gutierrez, talk to me.
- He's not here.

30:26.199 --> 30:30.232
- "Plane's empty."
- He must have spotted you.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.783
Stand by.
I'll call you back.

30:33.879 --> 30:36.088
Yeah, all right.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.512
Edmunds.

30:46.168 --> 30:49.592
Edmunds. Edmunds.

30:55.129 --> 30:57.432
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Take it easy!

30:57.527 --> 30:59.512
Who the hell are you?

30:59.608 --> 31:01.688
My name is Rafael Gutierrez.

31:01.784 --> 31:04.505
Mexican Intelligence. Check my pocket.
My left pocket. Check it.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.224
Get on your knees. Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

31:07.321 --> 31:09.529
All right. All right.

31:12.408 --> 31:14.233
How do you know my name?

31:14.328 --> 31:16.473
Your boss sent me to find you.
Tony Almeida, C.T.U.

31:16.568 --> 31:18.393
His access code
is 3-Tango-664.

31:22.744 --> 31:24.664
Get up.

31:26.297 --> 31:29.113
- What does he want?
- He wants you to call him.

31:29.209 --> 31:31.034
I've got a phone right here.

31:31.129 --> 31:34.585
He says it's a matter
of life or death about Jack Bauer.

31:35.641 --> 31:37.465
Gimme the phone.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.058
Thank you.

31:49.754 --> 31:52.089
Almeida.

31:52.186 --> 31:54.009
- "It's Edmunds."
- Listen, Chase.

31:54.106 --> 31:58.107
- If you're trying to get me
to come back, you're wasting...

31:58.202 --> 31:59.865
Chase!

32:05.626 --> 32:08.570
Chase, what's going on?
Chase, can you hear me?

32:14.746 --> 32:17.530
- Tony, are you there?
- What's going on?

32:17.626 --> 32:20.891
The guy you sent is dead.
A sniper took him out.

32:20.987 --> 32:23.674
I'm being pursued.

32:32.923 --> 32:35.387
Chase!

32:40.154 --> 32:43.707
" Chase!"

32:51.451 --> 32:53.691
Chase!

33:24.796 --> 33:26.716
- Dr. Packard.
- I'm supposed to see the president.

33:26.844 --> 33:28.668
Follow me, ma'am.

33:33.853 --> 33:36.509
Come.

33:41.404 --> 33:43.996
Anne.

33:45.276 --> 33:47.517
- "How are you holding up?"
- I'm okay.

33:49.468 --> 33:51.740
Are those the letters?

34:04.925 --> 34:08.188
Oh, this is good, David.
This is very good.

34:08.284 --> 34:11.358
- "This clears up everything."
- Yes. Yes, it does.

34:11.453 --> 34:14.717
Once these get authenticated,
we'll take 'em to the press.

34:14.813 --> 34:18.556
You'll be off the hook,
and Keeler should be hoisted right up on it.

34:18.652 --> 34:21.022
Yeah, I thought you'd be pleased.

34:22.077 --> 34:24.318
"Anne, listen." Um...

34:27.806 --> 34:29.597
I'm sorry about Ted.

34:29.694 --> 34:31.870
I really am.

34:31.966 --> 34:34.943
And if there's
anything that I can do...

34:35.038 --> 34:37.661
anything at all...pleasejust...

34:37.759 --> 34:40.414
let me know.

34:40.509 --> 34:42.878
Thank you.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.879
Excuse me.

34:55.389 --> 34:57.310
- Anne.
- I'm all right, David.

34:57.439 --> 34:59.263
I'm gonna be all right. But...

35:00.766 --> 35:03.262
something came out of this.

35:03.358 --> 35:05.855
And it was suddenly so clear to me.

35:05.950 --> 35:09.214
What was clear?

35:09.311 --> 35:12.095
I don't know how to say this
except to just say it.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.134
I think we need to end things.

35:19.903 --> 35:23.711
After what's just happened...

35:23.839 --> 35:27.647
after what's been happening all day,
I can understand why you'd want some time apart.

35:27.775 --> 35:30.303
David, it's not about time apart.

35:30.399 --> 35:34.240
- Anne, don't do...
- And it's true, this day has been awful.

35:34.367 --> 35:39.296
But... it just confirms something
that I've been feeling for a while.

35:41.503 --> 35:44.256
I can't live in your world.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.840
The things that people
do to each other.

35:47.936 --> 35:49.824
The things they have to do
in order to survive.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.095
I just... I can't.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.272
That's exactly why I need you.

35:54.367 --> 35:57.857
You need someone
who can stand beside you.

35:57.952 --> 36:00.544
Not someone who stands back
and watches and...

36:00.640 --> 36:04.896
oh, maybe passes judgment on things
she doesn't really understand.

36:10.657 --> 36:12.480
I'm sorry.

36:16.768 --> 36:20.065
You are the finest man
I have ever known.

36:21.921 --> 36:24.289
And Wayne, God bless him...

36:24.417 --> 36:26.593
he's just what you need,
and I'm so glad you have him.

36:26.689 --> 36:29.920
But... it's not for me.

36:46.017 --> 36:47.842
Good-bye, David.

36:51.682 --> 36:53.281
Anne.

37:10.082 --> 37:13.027
- Hello.
- Michael, it's Jack Bauer. Can you hear me?

37:13.154 --> 37:15.875
I can hear you, Jack.
I'm glad you arrived safely.

37:15.970 --> 37:18.146
Where are you?

37:18.241 --> 37:20.418
You know I can't
tell you that, Jack.

37:20.514 --> 37:23.106
Okay, fine.
Then where do you wanna meet?

37:23.202 --> 37:25.762
I'll call you back in a few minutes.
Give me the number you're calling from.

37:25.859 --> 37:28.131
Okay, I'm on a satellite phone.
One second.

37:29.635 --> 37:32.162
The number's 34221.

37:32.258 --> 37:34.307
- You'll hear from me soon.
- Okay, good.

37:37.411 --> 37:40.259
- You better have your money prepared.
- Don't worry about that.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.019
He came in by plane
just south of the town.

37:50.116 --> 37:52.964
He was with a "federale"
that they killed.

37:53.091 --> 37:56.355
I know this man.
He's Bauer's partner!

37:56.451 --> 37:58.659
- Was he with anyone else?
- "No, just the" federale "and him."

37:58.755 --> 38:00.899
- What the hell are you doing here?
- " Hey, shut up!"

38:00.995 --> 38:03.844
If he's here, others will be here soon.
We gotta get outta here.

38:03.972 --> 38:07.715
Tomas, make sure everything is ready.
We're moving out of here now!

38:07.811 --> 38:10.211
I knew it.
Bauer's been lying to us all along.

38:10.339 --> 38:13.316
That's not true.
I had no idea he was coming down here.

38:13.411 --> 38:15.908
- You've been playing us for fools again.
- You're making a mistake.

38:16.004 --> 38:18.883
Hector, please.
We can still do this deal.

38:19.011 --> 38:21.636
Don't let your brother
piss away a billion dollars.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.556
Ramon, what if he's
telling the truth?

38:23.652 --> 38:26.660
You keep hearing what you wanna hear.
This is an act.

38:26.756 --> 38:29.060
- "It's all been an act."
- How do you know?

38:29.157 --> 38:34.371
Ramon, I swear to you, I'm not lying.
Please, let's do this deal.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.868
- "What the hell is going on here, Jack?"
- Shut up, Chase.

38:36.996 --> 38:39.300
You should never have
followed me down here.

38:39.397 --> 38:41.061
You with them?

38:41.156 --> 38:42.981
Yes, I'm with them.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.820
You say he's not with you?

38:50.917 --> 38:52.740
Yes, that's right.

38:54.501 --> 38:56.324
Then kill him.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.980
Kill your partner.

38:59.077 --> 39:01.796
You want me to kill him?
Fine, I'll kill him, Ramon.

39:01.893 --> 39:05.445
But we would be smarter to use him
for information and maybe even as a hostage.

39:05.541 --> 39:09.540
No more clever talk.
You keep saying you are on our side.

39:09.637 --> 39:12.037
Now prove it once and for all.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.285
Fine.

39:23.493 --> 39:26.150
You should never have come down here, Chase.
You should have listened to me.

39:47.621 --> 39:49.446
Very good, Jack.

39:49.542 --> 39:53.510
We'll take him with us.
Bauer's right.

39:53.607 --> 39:55.718
Let's find out what he knows.
Break him down.

39:55.815 --> 39:58.406
See if anyone came here with him.

40:02.663 --> 40:06.919
We'll go to a safe house,
and we'll wait for Amador's call.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.631
- "Jack."
- Shut up, Chase.

40:34.726 --> 40:36.583
You wanna get through this,
just shut up.

40:42.248 --> 40:44.744
Damn it.

40:55.272 --> 40:58.760
Tony, I don't know how but the transponder
in Jack's watch just went dead.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.672
- Did you try a reset?
- Yeah. Nothing.

41:01.768 --> 41:04.104
Damn it!

41:04.200 --> 41:08.040
By the time the assault teams are in position,
we'll have no idea where he is.
