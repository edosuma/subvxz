Tam'vitte...

00:12.212 --> 00:13.679
Rel mestal!

00:13.747 --> 00:15.612
Mestal te'iote senve.

Siote ven'suil.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.925
Tam'vitte,
me'iote sendaya Voyager.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.569
Federation Starship Voyager,

00:44.644 --> 00:47.078
if you can hear me,
please respond.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.371 --> 02:54.602
lf you can hear me,
please respond.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.801
Voyager, please respond.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.173
Come on, Voyager.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.939
l know you're there.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.271
Hello?

03:03.349 --> 03:05.840
Voyager?

03:05.919 --> 03:07.716
Are you receiving
this transmission?

03:07.787 --> 03:09.846
My designation is Mezoti.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.620
You sound a little young
to be working the com.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.183
l'm eight.

03:15.261 --> 03:18.492
l see. Are there any grownups
l could speak to?

03:18.565 --> 03:21.534
My species is 689, Norcadian.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.568
What species are you?

03:25.171 --> 03:27.731
That's a complicated question.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.898
Explain.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.738
l don't know how long
l can keep this channel open.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.802
l need you to patch me through
to Captain Janeway.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.275
l'll try, but my height
may be insufficient.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.629
Hello?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.031
Voyager?

03:59.973 --> 04:03.966
Mezoti, you are not authorized
to be in here.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.908
Are you going to report me
to the Captain?

04:06.012 --> 04:07.343
Considering this is

04:07.413 --> 04:10.871
your first offense,
a warning will suffice.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.381
What were my instructions?

04:15.455 --> 04:18.390
To wait in the Cargo Bay
until you returned.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.685
Why didn't you comply?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.726
You left the children
unsupervised.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.888
Lieutenant Torres required
my assistance in Engineering.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.896
l was gone for less
than ten minutes.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.900
We told her not to deviate
from your instructions.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.401
She wouldn't listen.

04:32.472 --> 04:33.905
When the Captain asked you

04:33.973 --> 04:35.406
to take charge
of these children,

04:35.475 --> 04:38.308
you assured her that
you could maintain order.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.608
Controlling them is
proving more difficult

04:40.680 --> 04:41.704
than l anticipated.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.749
They're highly unpredictable.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.477
Meditation helps
Vulcan children

04:45.551 --> 04:46.950
to control their emotions.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.112
You might consider...

04:48.187 --> 04:49.484
Mezoti!

04:49.555 --> 04:51.580
l'm trying to talk
to the woman.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.557
What woman?

04:54.627 --> 04:58.256
The one transmitting
from Spatial Grid 2369.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.829
She's made contact
with a small ship,

05:05.004 --> 05:07.029
approximately
three light- years from here.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.802
Alien vessel, this is
the Starship Voyager.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.104
Respond.

05:11.177 --> 05:15.409
Tuvok? That's you, isn't it?

05:15.481 --> 05:17.506
This is Lieutenant
Commander Tuvok.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.278
Sounds like
someone got promoted.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.217
l want to hear all about it,
but first

05:21.287 --> 05:22.879
l need to speak
to Captain Janeway.

05:29.028 --> 05:32.156
You're a sight for sore eyes,
Captain.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.596
You, too, Harry.

05:38.104 --> 05:41.267
l'm sorry, but do we know you?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.434
l'm Ensign Lyndsay Ballard.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.443
l was a member of your crew.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.947
Of course, l'm not surprised
you don't recognize me.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.449
l don't know who you are,
but l'm not amused.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.111
Ensign Ballard died almost...

05:54.187 --> 05:56.246
lt was on stardate 51563.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.756
l can't blame you
for being skeptical, Captain.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.419
But if you'd let me come aboard,
l can explain everything.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.098
We'll beam you to Sick Bay.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.262
l'm sure you'll want me
behind a level- 10 force field.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.101
No offense.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.162
None taken.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.765
l'm just glad to be home.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.037
Captain?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.480
What do you think?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.743
She seems to have
intimate knowledge

06:24.817 --> 06:27.149
of this ship and its crew.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.848
l think we should
find out who she is.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.891
Captain,
l'd like to come with you.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.893
l was very close to Lyndsay

06:34.994 --> 06:37.360
and if somehow it's her...

06:37.430 --> 06:39.227
l'll know.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.664
Harry and l were on our way
to a Class- M planet

06:45.772 --> 06:48.468
in the Vyntadi expanse,
to recover dilithium ore

06:48.541 --> 06:50.270
we'd detected
a few days earlier.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.709
When we landed, we
realized it was a trap

06:52.779 --> 06:54.269
set by a Hirogen hunting party.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.905
They'd reconfigured a power cell

06:55.982 --> 06:57.779
to give off
false dilithium readings.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.545
That's exactly what happened.

06:59.619 --> 07:00.483
Go on.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.987
Harry and l headed
back to the shuttle.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.823
We were ten feet away, when l
was hit with a neural disrupter.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.394
Harry said
my injury wasn't that bad.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.488
He always was a terrible liar.

07:12.565 --> 07:16.296
l tried to get Lyndsay back
to Voyager, but...

07:16.402 --> 07:18.836
she was already dead.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.497
We buried her in space.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.767
Go on with your story.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.707
l woke up on a ship,

07:24.777 --> 07:26.972
in a stasis chamber
surrounded by aliens.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.379
They told me they'd used their
technology to reanimate me.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.214
l didn't believe them
when they said l'd died,

07:33.286 --> 07:36.255
but they showed me visual scans
of my own corpse

07:36.322 --> 07:38.882
lying in the torpedo casing
l'd been buried in.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.425
The Kobali said
l'd been drifting for weeks.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.587
''Kobali''?

07:43.663 --> 07:45.824
lf you ever met them,
you'd remember.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.388
They look just like this.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.230
After the reanimation process,

07:49.335 --> 07:51.462
they spent months altering
my DNA.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.539
They were constantly
scanning me,

07:53.606 --> 07:54.538
injecting me...

07:54.607 --> 07:56.575
Just to make you look
like one of them?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.303
That's how they procreate.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.572
They salvage the dead
of other races.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.308
l was given a Kobali name
and placed with a family

08:03.382 --> 08:04.747
to help me acclimate.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.751
You were a prisoner.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.252
At first.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.825
l wanted to contact you
to tell you l was safe,

08:15.962 --> 08:18.123
but the Kobali wouldn't let me.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.633
They said you were part
of my kyn'steya...

08:21.701 --> 08:24.534
my...

08:24.637 --> 08:29.870
my past life, and that l
needed to forget you...

08:29.942 --> 08:31.273
all of you.

08:33.546 --> 08:36.174
So l spent two years
letting my new family

08:36.249 --> 08:37.773
think l'd accepted them.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.977
When l finally earned
their trust,

08:40.052 --> 08:44.352
l stole a shuttle
and started looking for Voyager.

08:44.423 --> 08:45.788
That was six months ago.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.883
They've been chasing me
ever since.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.121
ln spite of her appearance,

08:50.196 --> 08:53.290
l'm detecting traces
of human DNA.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.233
l've compared them
with the genetic samples

08:56.335 --> 08:58.064
from Ensign Ballard's file.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.831
They match.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.640
lt's certainly
a convincing story.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.802
But your Starfleet training
is telling you

09:05.912 --> 09:07.641
to consider
all the possibilities.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.011
Maybe l'm some sort
of hybrid clone

09:10.082 --> 09:13.984
or a telepath who accessed
Ensign Ballard's memory somehow.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.181
Believe me, l was suspicious
myself at first,

09:17.256 --> 09:19.087
but l am Lyndsay Ballard.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.925
Until we find evidence
to the contrary...

09:37.777 --> 09:39.108
welcome home.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.882
Captain, could you
give us a minute?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.917
Doctor.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.495
So it's really you.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.228
ln the flesh...

10:03.336 --> 10:05.304
so to speak.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.714
l've missed you, too.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.329
l know you're all
as eager as l am

10:32.398 --> 10:34.593
to welcome Ensign Ballard back.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.157
She's a fine officer

10:36.235 --> 10:38.465
who's shown a lot
of courage and determination

10:38.571 --> 10:39.765
over the past few years,

10:39.872 --> 10:41.635
and we're lucky to have
her with us again.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.437
So let's do everything we can
to make her feel at home.

10:44.510 --> 10:45.977
Tom and l have already
taken the liberty

10:46.112 --> 10:48.137
of removing Lyndsay's
personal effects from storage.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.704
And whenever you're ready,

10:49.782 --> 10:51.773
your old shift is waiting
for you in Engineering.

10:51.851 --> 10:52.977
Thanks, Lieutenant.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.145
Before we get ahead
of ourselves, let's not forget

10:55.221 --> 10:56.848
the Kobali are still out there.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.914
lt seems they want her back
as much as we want to keep her.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.459
We'll need to take precautions

11:01.560 --> 11:03.255
in case
they track her to Voyager.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.889
l've run preliminary scans
on the Kobali shuttle.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.795
l believe l can adapt
our systems

11:07.867 --> 11:09.459
to counter a possible attack.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.557
Very good.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.230
Well, if there's
no further business...

11:17.977 --> 11:20.639
Thank you for saying
those nice things about me.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.941
You seem surprised.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.516
To be honest, l never
thought you noticed me.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.483
My mistake.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.385
So, you still playing
the clarinet?

11:32.458 --> 11:35.120
Actually, l've taken up
the saxophone.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.684
Ambitious.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.559
l bet you're good at it.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.065
You always were my biggest fan.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.896
Please, no past tense.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.230
Sorry.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.894
This is a little strange for me.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.199
Really?

11:47.306 --> 11:50.207
lt's been a perfectly
normal day for me.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.542
Deck 2.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.442
lt just so happens
that hearing you

11:54.513 --> 11:56.708
play music again
is #26 on my list.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.306
List?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.079
Something l made up
to pass the time

12:00.152 --> 12:01.084
while l was away.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.212
l tried to think of
everything l would do

12:03.289 --> 12:04.654
if l got back to Voyager- -

12:04.724 --> 12:06.885
including some things l
wasn't able to accomplish

12:06.992 --> 12:08.254
the first time l was here.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.192
Like showing up
for duty shifts on time?

12:10.262 --> 12:12.628
That's #27.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.094
They're here.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.476
Ah.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.477
Why don't you and l
have a cup of tea

12:26.545 --> 12:27.807
while the children play?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.178
Thank you, but they require
my supervision.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.876
l like your braid.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.647
l could show you how to do it.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.914
Mezoti.

12:35.988 --> 12:38.252
Something wrong?

12:38.324 --> 12:41.088
l've allotted one hour
for recreational activity.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.685
There's no time
for irrelevant conversation.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.321
lt's not irrelevant.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.195
Adhering to our schedule
will allow us to use our time

12:48.300 --> 12:49.597
more efficiently.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.897
We'll be able
to participate in a wider...

12:52.004 --> 12:54.097
...Wider variety of activities.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.269
Fun will now commence.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.504
Green.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.013
Grid 313.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.750
Counter. Grid 10.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.059
They're cheating.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.392
How?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.092
Azan is using
his neural interface

13:21.167 --> 13:23.067
to share information.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.397
ls this true?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.099
You will exercise
Punishment Protocol 9- Alpha.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.651
lf they cannot participate,
neither will l.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.278
You are encouraging disorder.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.288
And you never let us do
what we want.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.751
You will exercise
Punishment Protocol 9- Alpha.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.127
No... l won't.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.401
There you go.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.670
l can't believe
you saved all this.

14:05.744 --> 14:08.611
Tuvok thought l should
recycle everything,

14:08.681 --> 14:11.673
but l just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.844
My skates and l thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.459
Do you know how long
it took me to fold those?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.058
Same old Harry.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.899
What's that supposed to mean?

14:33.038 --> 14:36.098
You're still sort of obsessive.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.369
l'm tidy.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.709
ls that why you used to request
baryon sweeps of your dorm room?

14:41.780 --> 14:44.510
When you live across the hall
from a slob...

14:44.583 --> 14:45.777
Hey.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.944
Show some respect for the dead.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.522
Did l say something wrong?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.789
lt's nothing.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.387
Just because l've been gone
for three years

14:59.465 --> 15:02.298
doesn't mean l can't
still read you like a book.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.337
l gave the eulogy
at your funeral.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.098
Oh?

15:11.944 --> 15:13.673
What'd you say?

15:15.414 --> 15:16.676
Come on.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.616
lt's everyone's fantasy
to hear their own eulogy.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.812
Absolutely not.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.956
lt's probably for the best.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.423
You always were
a terrible public speaker.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.358
Just hope you didn't
stutter too much.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.176
l told them you had
a favorite saying...

15:45.244 --> 15:46.609
something you got

15:46.679 --> 15:49.671
from an old Klingon battle cry.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.080
''Own the Day.''

15:52.151 --> 15:55.382
l said that you
always believed in...

15:55.454 --> 15:57.217
attacking each day...

15:57.289 --> 15:59.450
possessing it...

15:59.525 --> 16:01.322
and that that was

16:01.427 --> 16:04.021
what made you so much
fun to be around.

16:04.063 --> 16:07.157
ls that when everybody
burst into tears?

16:09.234 --> 16:11.168
l said that,
if you'd been there,

16:11.236 --> 16:14.694
you would have told
them to own that day,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.298
to attack it, make it their own

16:17.409 --> 16:19.707
and plan to do
the same thing tomorrow.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.613
Pretty strong stuff.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.447
You were a strong person.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.680
Not always.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.848
These last six months
haven't been easy.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.892
There were plenty of times
when l could have given up.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.517
But you didn't.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.562
You know why?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.629
You.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.964
l wanted to see you again.

16:47.806 --> 16:51.469
Hmm. Guess l won't be
needing this anymore.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.943
Sick Bay to Ensign Ballard.

16:56.048 --> 17:01.418
l've finished analyzing
your bio- scans.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.352
l'm on my way.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.820
My scans identified

17:04.890 --> 17:07.154
a genetic pathogen
in your bloodstream.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.491
lt appears to have converted
most of your human DNA

17:10.561 --> 17:12.587
into a Kobali protein structure.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.256
ls there any way to reverse it?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.324
The biochemical changes
have affected

17:16.402 --> 17:17.767
every system in your body.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.839
l'm afraid there isn't
enough of your original DNA left

17:20.906 --> 17:23.032
to make you human again.

17:23.142 --> 17:27.738
But l believe l can effect
some cosmetic changes.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.007
Are you saying

17:29.081 --> 17:31.106
you could make me
look like me again?

17:31.183 --> 17:33.014
Yes.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.679
The alternations would
literally be skin- deep

17:35.754 --> 17:37.722
and it may take
several treatments,

17:37.790 --> 17:40.156
but l've devised
an inaprovaline compound

17:40.225 --> 17:41.749
which should do the trick.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.294
Physiologically,
you'd still be Kobali

17:43.362 --> 17:44.852
with a multispheric brain,

17:44.930 --> 17:46.989
a binary cardiovascular
system...

17:47.066 --> 17:48.397
But l'd look human.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.661
Oh, yes.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.328
l've lived with this face
for long enough.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.370
Let's do it.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.669
Have a seat.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.902
You may experience
some dizziness.

17:57.976 --> 17:59.637
l'll hang on to Harry
for support,

17:59.711 --> 18:00.973
if he doesn't mind.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.411
That's what l'm here for.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.424
What?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.017
Something wrong?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.590
See for yourself.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.849
Here we are...

18:38.917 --> 18:41.715
one Jiballian Berry salad.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.082
l have been looking
forward to this

18:45.157 --> 18:47.557
for a very long time.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.059
lt was #6 on her list.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.255
There isn't much variety
in the Kobali diet.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.231
We ate the same gray
paste for three years.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.530
lt doesn't taste
the way l remember it.

19:02.574 --> 19:03.768
What's wrong? Too sweet?

19:03.842 --> 19:07.676
No offense, but it's got
sort of a metallic flavor.

19:13.118 --> 19:14.710
Seems fine to me.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.381
l guess my taste buds
are still Kobali.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.357
Can l get you something else?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.722
Thanks.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.057
But l need to take care of #16:

19:24.129 --> 19:25.926
Dazzle Lieutenant Torres.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.871
One minute early.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.873
There's a first time
for everything.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.137
An alignment error
has been cropping up

19:40.212 --> 19:41.577
in the dilithium matrix.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.445
We can't seem to figure
out what's causing it.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.677
l- l know that you're
still settling in,

19:46.752 --> 19:49.118
so l'll give you
a couple of days to...

19:49.188 --> 19:50.746
lt's a vyk'tiote.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.084
Excuse me?

19:52.157 --> 19:53.818
Oh, a Kobali word to describe

19:53.892 --> 19:55.655
a certain kind
of wave phenomenon.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.126
lt's hard to translate.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.130
Try me.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.599
Literally, it means
''crumpled dance.''

20:02.701 --> 20:07.297
All l need to do is vyq'tal
the qen'dioqe matrices,

20:07.406 --> 20:11.570
stabilize the per'cheya,
tez'tel se nenna...

20:11.643 --> 20:13.611
Cham'bioque!

20:15.414 --> 20:16.938
What?

20:17.082 --> 20:19.778
You were speaking Kobali.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.956
l didn't realize.

20:27.092 --> 20:28.354
l'm sorry.

20:28.427 --> 20:33.524
Well, whatever you did,
the alignment error is gone.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.964
Nice job.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.795
Thanks.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.433
l think there might be
a few... ''crumpled dances''

20:42.541 --> 20:44.338
in the warp core, too.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.274
Feel like taking a look?

20:52.918 --> 20:54.510
Any sign of the Kobali?

20:54.586 --> 20:55.848
None.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.355
The latest tactical reports
from Tuvok.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.890
Commander...

21:01.526 --> 21:03.892
l no longer wish
to serve as guardian

21:04.029 --> 21:05.462
to the Borg children.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.464
What's the problem?

21:07.532 --> 21:09.124
Their behavior is chaotic.

21:09.234 --> 21:13.227
My attempts to apply discipline
only result in further disorder.

21:13.338 --> 21:16.398
Well, kids and disorder
usually go hand- in- hand.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.237
Neelix issued
a similar warning

21:18.310 --> 21:20.301
prior to my taking
this assignment,

21:20.379 --> 21:22.939
which is why l devised
an activities schedule

21:23.048 --> 21:24.640
to promote focus and unity.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.617
0700 hours, the children
emerge from their alcoves.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.916
Nutrients are ingested
in the Mess Hall

21:29.988 --> 21:31.956
prior to proceeding
to the Science Lab

21:32.024 --> 21:33.048
to begin classes.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.559
At 1300 hours, nutrients
are consumed a second time

21:35.627 --> 21:37.151
before reporting
to the holodeck,

21:37.229 --> 21:39.720
where they're studying
comparative alien physiology.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.460
Doesn't sound like
there's much time for fun.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.966
On the contrary.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.468
l've scheduled
recreational activities.

21:46.538 --> 21:49.063
You can't always
schedule fun, Seven.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.540
Sometimes it needs
to be spontaneous.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.443
According to my research,
children require structure.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.378
l agree,
but not to this extreme.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.849
You're treating them like
they're still on a Borg cube.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.886
You're comparing me
to the collective?

22:02.020 --> 22:04.420
You have all four children
functioning as one.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.117
They do the same things together
at the same time.

22:07.192 --> 22:10.218
So that each child has
the same opportunities to learn.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.627
They're individuals.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.133
Maybe they're rebelling

22:16.234 --> 22:18.395
because you don't let them
express themselves.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.936
Then grant my request.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.168
Choose a more suitable
crew member to instruct them.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.503
Sorry, Seven.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.441
Permission denied.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.553
Well, l see you're finally
going to try my hockey program.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.952
Actually, l'm taking
Lyndsay skating.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.921
Oh. Mm. You two sure
have been spending

22:39.991 --> 22:41.424
a lot of time together lately.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.892
Don't start.

22:42.961 --> 22:44.155
Oh, now, let's see...

22:44.229 --> 22:45.662
for those of us keeping score,

22:45.731 --> 22:47.562
Harry Kim has fallen
for a hologram,

22:47.632 --> 22:50.328
a Borg, the wrong twin

22:50.435 --> 22:51.595
and now, the dearly departed.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.364
We're friends.

22:53.472 --> 22:54.939
- Ah.
- Just like before.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.635
Uh, all right,
maybe there was a time

22:58.710 --> 23:00.337
when l thought
of pursuing Lyndsay,

23:00.445 --> 23:01.673
but l closed the door on that

23:01.713 --> 23:03.340
when we both got assigned
to Voyager.

23:03.415 --> 23:04.746
Mm. Don't look now,

23:04.816 --> 23:07.011
but that door is creaking open.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.224
What do you think?

23:23.335 --> 23:25.860
Uh... you look great.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.030
Doctor thought l should stick
to my original color,

23:28.140 --> 23:29.402
but this seemed more exciting.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.237
Hair is one of my specialties,

23:31.309 --> 23:34.107
despite evidence
to the contrary.

23:34.179 --> 23:35.407
lt's just too bad

23:35.480 --> 23:37.311
that beneath
this beautiful red hair

23:37.382 --> 23:39.782
still lies the six- lobed
brain of a Kobali.

23:39.851 --> 23:42.718
Well, are you feeling human
enough for a little skating?

23:42.788 --> 23:45.951
l'd love to, but l
already have a date.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.353
Who with?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.688
The Captain.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.955
She's invited me
to her quarters for dinner.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.961
ln six years, l have
never been invited

23:53.098 --> 23:54.963
to the Captain's
quarters for dinner.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.728
Well, l'll give her
your regards.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.602
Oh, damn!

24:08.180 --> 24:09.272
Come in.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.875
Formal dress
wasn't required, Ensign.

24:14.019 --> 24:17.511
Well, l just... l figured
dinner with the Captain...

24:17.589 --> 24:19.056
l'd hardly call this dinner.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.615
My replicator decided
to liquefy the pot roast.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.888
lt looks fine to me.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.691
Stop trying
to get on my good side

24:25.764 --> 24:27.129
and grab a slice of bread.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.429
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.899
l hope you don't mind.

24:31.069 --> 24:32.297
Not at all.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.269
l lived on them at the Academy.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.899
So, how was your first day
back on the job?

24:37.075 --> 24:38.508
Pretty good, l think.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.341
Lieutenant Torres called
my work ''competent.''

24:41.413 --> 24:44.871
Trust me, that's high praise
coming from B'Elanna.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.381
Commander Tuvok finished
his analysis of your shuttle

24:51.456 --> 24:53.720
and presented me
with 37 different ways

24:53.792 --> 24:55.521
of repelling a Kobali attack.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.824
Did he include your pot roast?

24:58.997 --> 24:59.964
l'm sorry.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.623
l didn't mean...

25:01.666 --> 25:04.260
l can't believe
l just said that.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.564
Why? lt was funny.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.297
We're not on the Bridge,
Lyndsay.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.270
You have permission
to speak freely.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.366
Do you really mean that?

25:11.476 --> 25:14.104
l wouldn't
have said it otherwise.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.307
Then... there's something
l've wanted to ask you

25:17.382 --> 25:18.849
for a long time.

25:20.485 --> 25:22.817
Why me?

25:22.888 --> 25:24.879
l'm sorry?

25:24.990 --> 25:27.891
Why did you choose me
for that away mission?

25:27.959 --> 25:31.622
Well, l suppose l thought you
were best suited for the job.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.324
No, l wasn't.

25:34.399 --> 25:35.627
Dilithium extraction

25:35.700 --> 25:38.601
was always Lieutenant Torres'
specialty.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.900
And Tuvok had
far more experience

25:41.006 --> 25:42.701
conducting away missions,

25:42.774 --> 25:44.708
but you didn't send
either one of them.

25:44.776 --> 25:47.370
Was it because
they were closer to you?

25:49.414 --> 25:50.847
You blame me.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.146
No. No, that's not what l meant.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.515
- lt's okay, Lyndsay.
- No, it's not.

25:54.586 --> 25:55.848
l'm not offended.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.821
No, you d...
you don't understand.

25:59.524 --> 26:02.982
''Never harbor anger toward those
who brought you death,

26:03.094 --> 26:05.995
for they gave you the chance
to live again.''

26:06.031 --> 26:11.162
ln letting me die, Captain,
you gave me life.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.473
l'm sorry.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.303
Lyndsay...

26:17.375 --> 26:18.307
l'm sorry.

26:18.376 --> 26:19.502
l shouldn't have come.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.390
You're late.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.483
We expected you hours ago.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.492
For what?

26:36.561 --> 26:37.823
Your farewell party.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.693
You weren't supposed
to come back.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.356
You don't belong here anymore.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.900
Harry, what's going on?

26:43.001 --> 26:44.935
''Lyndsay Ballard, beloved friend

26:45.070 --> 26:46.833
and crewman''- - 
does that sound right?

26:46.938 --> 26:48.235
What?

26:48.306 --> 26:49.603
For your eulogy...

26:49.674 --> 26:51.164
does that sound okay?

26:51.276 --> 26:53.301
Harry, l'm not dead.

26:53.378 --> 26:56.313
Denial: one of the final stages.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.145
lt was illogical for you
to return.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.715
Please, l don't want to go.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.779
l couldn't save
you before, Lyndsay.

27:05.857 --> 27:08.155
What makes you think
l can save you now?

27:11.196 --> 27:15.257
Jen'to ka'siote... Jhet'leya.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.341
Come in.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.881
What's wrong?

27:33.018 --> 27:34.883
Bad day, l guess.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.887
B'Elanna told me
you did great in Engineering.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.820
l solved a simple problem.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.882
Didn't sound so simple to me.

27:42.027 --> 27:45.485
Any Kobali can discern
simple wave distortions.

27:45.563 --> 27:49.897
Even if B'Elanna was impressed,
the others were staring at me.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.434
l'm sure it was
just your imagination.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.369
And then, to make
matters worse,

27:54.439 --> 27:56.907
l started babbling
in front of the Captain.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.977
Oh. l used to get pretty
nervous around her, too.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.802
Yeah, don't worry.

28:02.914 --> 28:05.405
l'm sure she didn't
take it personally.

28:09.287 --> 28:10.515
Hey...

28:12.557 --> 28:14.525
l know this isn't easy...

28:16.461 --> 28:18.588
but l'll help you through this.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.827
You have always been
far too nice to me.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.437
Why is that?

28:31.342 --> 28:34.368
You really don't have
any idea, do you?

28:36.181 --> 28:37.978
Think about it.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.882
l rearranged my schedule
at the Academy

28:40.985 --> 28:43.647
just so we'd be
in the same classes.

28:43.722 --> 28:48.318
l let you teach me how to skate,
even though l hate the cold.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.053
l'm crazy about you.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.157
l have been
since the day we met.

28:56.267 --> 28:58.861
Why didn't you ever tell me?

29:01.439 --> 29:04.431
l was never good
at public speaking, remember?

29:07.445 --> 29:11.404
But l figure how often
do you get a second chance.

29:12.951 --> 29:17.354
Which is why l'd very much
like to kiss you now.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.450
''Own the Day.''

29:48.753 --> 29:51.221
Sorry.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.450
You are creating disorder.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.220
Seven will be angry.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.022
l don't care.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.900
They're cubes.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.469
l can see that.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.872
Precisely 1/1,000
the size of a Borg vessel.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.409
Well done.

30:14.913 --> 30:17.939
A 26- sided polyhedron,
composed of hexagons,

30:18.049 --> 30:20.711
octagons and squares.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.753
lmpressive.

30:28.092 --> 30:29.525
What's this?

30:29.594 --> 30:31.221
Can't you tell?

30:33.264 --> 30:35.061
lt's you.

30:35.133 --> 30:38.398
l don't see the resemblance.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.299
Look.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.133
Here's your ocular implant,

30:41.239 --> 30:42.501
your nose,

30:42.574 --> 30:43.905
your mouth...

30:43.975 --> 30:45.966
You were instructed to create
a geometric shape.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.339
l reminded her of that.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.175
She wouldn't comply.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.874
This was more fun.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.877
Don't you like it?

30:55.954 --> 30:58.514
lt is crude.

31:00.058 --> 31:04.518
However, it does demonstrate
ingenuity and individuality.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.587
She deviated
from your instructions.

31:06.664 --> 31:10.657
Aren't you going to implement
a punishment protocol?

31:12.570 --> 31:14.037
No.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.903
Resume your disorder.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.219
Lyndsay?

31:31.589 --> 31:33.557
They're coming.

31:39.597 --> 31:40.894
Red Alert.

31:40.965 --> 31:41.897
Raise shields.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.366
We are being hailed.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.561
On screen.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.771
l've come for Jhet'leya.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.637
lf you're referring
to Ensign Ballard,

31:50.708 --> 31:53.609
she's made it clear that she
doesn't want to go with you.

31:53.678 --> 31:55.145
She's my daughter.

31:56.681 --> 32:00.447
Please... l've come a long way.

32:00.518 --> 32:03.078
l only want to speak with her.

32:09.394 --> 32:11.055
You don't have
to see him, you know.

32:11.129 --> 32:12.391
They can't make you.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.863
l want to, Harry.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.367
lt's time to stop running.

32:20.471 --> 32:22.439
l appreciate this, Captain.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.804
l'm willing to oblige

32:23.875 --> 32:27.106
as long as you understand
that this meeting is over

32:27.178 --> 32:29.703
as soon as Ensign Ballard
says it is.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.683
What have they done to you?

32:33.751 --> 32:35.776
Given me my life back.

32:35.853 --> 32:38.048
You were so beautiful.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.451
lt's good to see you, Jhet'leya.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.189
My name is Lyndsay.

32:45.263 --> 32:48.460
Why did you leave us?

32:48.533 --> 32:50.933
l wanted to be
with my people again.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.002
These people?

32:52.136 --> 32:54.570
The same ones who set you
adrift in space?

32:54.639 --> 32:58.405
We jettisoned her body
in accordance with our customs.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.773
You abandoned her.

32:59.844 --> 33:02.745
You had no right
to tamper with her remains.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.043
We were acting in accordance
with our customs.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.311
You mutilated her.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.477
Ensign...

33:09.554 --> 33:11.112
The reanimation process

33:11.189 --> 33:14.249
usually results in
extensive memory loss,

33:14.325 --> 33:17.419
which makes the transition
less painful.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.293
Unfortunately, some remember

33:20.365 --> 33:22.663
their former lives
more than others.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.292
Jhet'leya, for example.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.563
l told you to call me...

33:26.671 --> 33:28.036
Lyndsay Ballard.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.368
She's dead.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.536
She has been for three years.

33:33.611 --> 33:36.102
Forgive me for being so blunt,

33:36.180 --> 33:40.480
but when we found her,
she was a lifeless corpse.

33:40.551 --> 33:45.215
We salvaged that raw material
to create a new person- -

33:45.289 --> 33:47.621
my daughter- - whom l love.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.421
l'm not your daughter.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.486
You may have altered
your appearance,

33:52.563 --> 33:55.464
but do you still think
like these people?

33:55.533 --> 33:59.333
Even now, the first words
that come into your head,

33:59.437 --> 34:01.837
are they in their language
or mine?

34:01.939 --> 34:04.840
l realize this place

34:04.876 --> 34:08.676
is familiar to you,
but it's not where you belong.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.315
Your sister misses you.

34:13.951 --> 34:14.975
Tynsia.

34:15.053 --> 34:19.353
She keeps asking
when you're coming home.

34:19.424 --> 34:22.085
What should l tell her?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.568
Tell her that her sister's dead.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.071
l'll escort you
to the transporter room.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.338
l won't give her up, Captain.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.438
She made her wishes clear.

34:44.514 --> 34:45.880
She's confused.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.214
Thanks to what you did to her.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.551
l don't want to fight you.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.851
Your ship is no match
for Voyager.

34:55.726 --> 35:00.891
Every life is precious
to my people, Captain.

35:00.965 --> 35:04.128
l won't be coming back alone.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.248
Midnight snack?

35:22.720 --> 35:25.086
Kobali cuisine at its finest.

35:27.125 --> 35:31.061
So l was giving
some thought to #32- -

35:31.129 --> 35:33.029
''Make Tuvok laugh.''

35:33.097 --> 35:35.725
He has this holo- program,
''The Temple of T'Panit.''

35:35.800 --> 35:37.233
l thought we might tweak it,

35:37.335 --> 35:40.498
so that instead of Vulcan
prayers, the monks recite

35:40.605 --> 35:42.402
Ferengi limericks.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.909
You're not laughing.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.378
Sorry.

35:50.448 --> 35:53.076
l can't stop thinking
about Q'ret.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.245
l can't believe he had the nerve
to call himself your father.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.651
l'll bet Professor Ballard

35:57.722 --> 35:59.883
would have had something
to say about that.

35:59.957 --> 36:02.323
Who?

36:02.426 --> 36:05.395
Your... dad.

36:05.429 --> 36:08.125
Doesn't he teach
at some university?

36:09.734 --> 36:11.429
l don't remember.

36:13.804 --> 36:16.773
l don't remember
anything about him.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.710
Let's get down to the holodeck.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.408
We've got some monks to tweak.

36:25.483 --> 36:26.745
Sure.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.385
What's wrong?

36:44.769 --> 36:47.636
Why did she start to
revert all of a sudden?

36:47.705 --> 36:49.263
Our old friend, the pathogen.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.773
lt's adapting
to counteract my treatments.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.504
lt's possible she'll suffer
occasional relapses

36:54.579 --> 36:55.944
for the rest of her life.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.878
You said you could
maintain my appearance.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.940
l can, but it looks like
l'll need to increase

37:00.017 --> 37:01.450
the frequency
of your treatments.

37:01.485 --> 37:03.385
You'll have to see me
at least twice a day.

37:03.421 --> 37:07.551
How am l supposed to do my job
if l'm in here all the time?

37:07.625 --> 37:09.820
How am l supposed
to do anything?

37:09.961 --> 37:10.985
Please try to underst...

37:11.062 --> 37:12.529
Stoi'gia!

37:12.597 --> 37:14.531
Net'staika pen'daeli shevaob!

37:17.835 --> 37:18.961
l'm sorry.

37:37.054 --> 37:38.214
Wow.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.786
This place sure is lived- in.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.794
lf you're here to lecture
me about cleanliness...

37:44.862 --> 37:48.992
l'm here to ask you
to stop the treatments.

37:49.066 --> 37:51.864
You know what happens if l do.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.436
You'll look Kobali again?

37:53.504 --> 37:54.630
So what?

37:56.707 --> 37:57.901
l thought you were cute bald.

38:00.177 --> 38:01.337
l don't care

38:01.412 --> 38:03.346
if you're human,
Kobali or Bolian.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.006
l just want you to be happy.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.714
l wouldn't fit in.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.379
Are you saying Tuvok
and Neelix don't fit in?

38:10.454 --> 38:11.580
That's different.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.647
They got to grow up
in their own cultures.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.919
They know where they
come from, who they are.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.551
Wherever they come from,

38:17.628 --> 38:20.722
they're part of this crew now,
just like you.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.356
Lyndsay was part of this crew.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.266
lf l stop the treatments,
l won't be Lyndsay anymore.

38:25.369 --> 38:27.667
You don't honestly believe that.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.240
Since the day l got back here,
l haven't felt right.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.303
First l thought it was Voyager.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.007
Things had changed so much,

38:38.082 --> 38:40.642
l thought if l just
gave myself more time

38:40.718 --> 38:43.312
l'd get used to it.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.651
But it's me.

38:45.723 --> 38:48.487
l've changed.

38:50.528 --> 38:55.124
And the more l try to deny it,
the more l feel like a ghost.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.305
l'm sorry, Harry...

39:05.376 --> 39:08.140
but l can't
keep fighting anymore.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.737
What about us?

39:12.450 --> 39:17.581
The girl you were in love with
died three years ago.

39:26.731 --> 39:29.256
Shields down to 48 percent.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.994
Target the lead ship's
weapons array.

39:31.102 --> 39:34.970
Life support's failing
on Decks 6 through 10.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.132
Reroute power to compensate.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.038
Shields at 20 percent.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.873
Hail them.
Tell them you'll surrender me.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.139
Don't listen to her, Captain.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.681
l appreciate the gesture,
Lyndsay,

39:44.749 --> 39:45.977
but l'm not giving you up.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.881
lt's not a gesture.
l want to go.

39:48.018 --> 39:49.383
l don't belong here.

39:49.453 --> 39:50.715
She's not well.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.016
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

39:52.089 --> 39:55.024
l know exactly what l'm saying.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.184
Shields at 13 percent.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.057
l'm detecting power

39:58.129 --> 40:00.188
fluctuations
in the lead vessel's warp drive.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.562
A polaron burst
could overload the core.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.225
That would destroy the ship.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.269
They're not leaving
us much choice.

40:06.337 --> 40:09.306
Whatever we do,
we have to do it fast.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.409
You're sure
this is what you want.

40:12.476 --> 40:16.537
Captain, l can fire
that polaron burst myself.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.740
Stand down, Ensign.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.680
We can't just let them take her!

40:21.585 --> 40:24.679
Even if you stop them,
l can't stay on Voyager.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.121
l don't want to lose you.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.659
You already did,
but at least this time,

40:29.727 --> 40:32.457
we've been given the chance
to say good- bye.

40:36.667 --> 40:40.967
Captain's Log, Stardate 53679.4.

40:41.138 --> 40:43.732
The Doctor has stopped
Ensign Ballard's treatments,

40:43.841 --> 40:45.138
and her Kobali physiology

40:45.209 --> 40:47.336
is already beginning
to reassert itself.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.902
All but one of us
have said our good- byes.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.094
Vien'ke debala, Jhet'leya.

41:06.163 --> 41:09.155
l taught myself
to say a few words in Kobali.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.167
That's very sweet of you,

41:11.268 --> 41:15.068
but you just told me
the comets are tiresome.

41:17.074 --> 41:19.941
Guess l better work
on my pronunciation.

41:20.077 --> 41:21.908
l'm sorry
you didn't get to finish

41:21.979 --> 41:23.276
everything on your list.

41:30.421 --> 41:33.049
l think l took care of
what really mattered.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.329
That's pretty.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.037
lt belonged to a friend of mine.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.544
Would you like it?

42:28.612 --> 42:31.410
Your friend wouldn't mind?

42:31.482 --> 42:32.949
l think she'd be happy

42:33.050 --> 42:36.577
knowing l gave it to someone
with such pretty hair.

42:38.756 --> 42:42.624
Seven's letting us go
to the holodeck by ourselves.

42:42.693 --> 42:45.685
She says we can run
any program we want.

42:45.763 --> 42:47.526
Do you want to come?

42:47.598 --> 42:51.056
Have you ever heard
of ''The Temple of T'Panit''?

42:52.703 --> 42:54.170
lt's a Vulcan program.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.365
Sounds boring.

42:56.473 --> 42:57.667
Don't worry.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.368
We'll make a few tweaks.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
