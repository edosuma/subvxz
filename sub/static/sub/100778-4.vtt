Okay.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.306
Pitch me on slate.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.477
So, we are moving forward
with <i>Every Dame Needs a Fella,</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:23.481
a comedy where Gene Tierney,
posing as a nun,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.650
tricks William Holden into marrying her.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.278
Gene Tierney.
She's got an ass on her, right?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.406
Then there's <i>Tippecanoe.</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:34.701
Humphrey Bogart plays future president
William Henry Harrison

00:34.784 --> 00:36.661
as he slaughters the Shawnee.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.579

00:38.705 --> 00:40.081
What's with the long face?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.875
These movies are embarrassing.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.085
They are not up to the standards
of this studio.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.170
I run the studio.

00:45.628 --> 00:49.257
Let me determine what
or what is not beneath the standards.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.593
These are good pictures. They're hits.
I like them.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.553
I don't mind making movies
that are popular.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.431
I do mind making movies that are idiotic.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.184
These movies are idiotic,
and you pay me to tell you that.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.771
Richard has a picture
that we are very excited about.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.900
It's about Peg Entwistle,

01:06.983 --> 01:09.569
the young actress who jumped off
the Hollywoodland sign.

01:09.652 --> 01:13.114
It's about fame and ambition
and what Hollywood does to people.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.824
Yeah, my daughter wants a test for that.

01:14.908 --> 01:19.662
Oh, Ace, imagine what it would be like
to see Claire win an Oscar?

01:19.746 --> 01:22.916
It would be terrible! Can you imagine that
girl running around town with an Oscar?

01:22.999 --> 01:24.459
I mean, she'd take it everywhere.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.670
She'll figure out a way
to turn it into a dining utensil.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.589
-No, no. I don't want it.
-Ace,

01:29.672 --> 01:31.633
you could win an Oscar with this picture.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.927
Dick, I just won two Oscars.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.512
Let me tell you something.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.222
After you've won eight Oscars,

01:37.305 --> 01:39.808
there's no thrill
to winning another Oscar.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.184
You know what the thrill is?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.770
Money. That's the thrill.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.689
This is what I want. Write it down.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.568
Tits, sword-and-sandal,

01:51.319 --> 01:54.989
and, uh, you can throw in, uh,
a picture with a boy and a dog.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.243
Uh, maybe the dog dies at the end.
Maybe the kid has to kill the dog.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.160
You figure it out.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.456
Ace, I will make all of those pictures
for you, but you got to give me <i>Peg.</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:07.293
-What's the budget?
-400,000, all in-house players.

02:07.752 --> 02:08.878
You got 75.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.131
Ace, we have to build
a Hollywoodland sign!

02:11.214 --> 02:13.299
So you have her jump off
the Hollywood Bowl!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.801
Seventy-five is all you get.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.970
Now, get out of here.
Let me finish my lunch.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.055
Oh, Ace.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.393
[Archie]<i> Raymond, I don't understand.</i>

02:23.476 --> 02:25.728
All the studio agreed to
was a screen test.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.981
So you expect me to overhaul my script,

02:28.064 --> 02:30.650
a script the studio was fine
with buying as-is.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.610
It wouldn't be a complete rewrite.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.112
Really just the--

02:34.195 --> 02:37.365
the main character's name,
from Peg to Meg.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.076
[Archie] Camille, I'm sure you're grand,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.453
but with you as the star
and me as the writer,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.164
it becomes a message picture,

02:44.622 --> 02:46.374
for colored folks, limited distribution.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.458
Now y'all know that.

02:48.042 --> 02:51.212
Now, I didn't come to Hollywood
to make those kinds of pictures.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.258
Just like I didn't set out
to play domestics.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.678
I wrote <i>Peg</i> to prove my writing
was not limited by my race.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.597
That I can write for anyone.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.892
That I can write about a white girl from
London who grew up in New York City--

03:03.975 --> 03:07.145
I think we're getting a little ahead
of ourselves. It's just a screen test.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.313
Stop saying that, Raymond.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.609
Even if no one outside the studio
sees my screen test,

03:12.692 --> 03:15.737
it's still proof that a woman of color
could carry a picture.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.491
Miss Stinson!

03:21.701 --> 03:22.535
I'm off.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.287
What are we telling Mrs. Amberg?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.372
You'll be at a distributors conference
in Fresno,

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
where they're testing out
a new movie format.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.085
Great, and, uh,
you got the hacienda I like?

03:31.169 --> 03:33.463
Yes, sir, and 100 roses in the bedroom,
like you asked.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.423
-You're a genius!
-Thank you.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.259

03:51.731 --> 03:54.317
Camille Washington,
I'm one of your contract players.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.945
-[Ace] And who's he?
-I wrote it.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.029
Wrote what?

03:58.905 --> 03:59.906
<i>Peg.</i>

04:11.251 --> 04:15.630
I just don't get the impression
this Rock Hudson is very good.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.924
I think we should give
the kid a shot.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.385
If he's terrible, I'll talk to Henry.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.136

04:22.595 --> 04:26.516
What the fuck kind of commie bullshit
are you trying to pull on me?

04:26.599 --> 04:31.229
And were you gonna clue me in
on your plans to sink the fucking studio?

04:31.312 --> 04:32.730
The script was a blind submission.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.067
Have either of you fuckwits
ever heard of the Hays Code?

04:36.150 --> 04:39.320
Ace, there is no deviant sexual behavior
in this picture.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.656
There's no interracial relationships.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.325
Repellent subject matter!

04:44.409 --> 04:46.452
Anti-national feeling!

04:46.536 --> 04:49.330
And then they're gonna throw us out
of every movie theater in the South

04:49.414 --> 04:50.540

04:50.623 --> 04:52.292
Ace, he's the writer.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.169
He isn't a face up on the screen.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.714
Never, in the history of Hollywood,

04:57.797 --> 05:00.550
has there ever been a motion picture

05:00.633 --> 05:04.804
made by a motion picture studio
for a mainstream audience

05:04.887 --> 05:07.432

05:07.807 --> 05:09.684
And I'm not gonna be the first!

05:09.767 --> 05:12.103
All right, look.
We're gonna tell this guy,

05:12.186 --> 05:15.773
"Thank you very much for your services,"
and we go find a new writer.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.109
This script does not need a rewrite.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.027
Fine,

05:19.235 --> 05:21.404
then we slap somebody else's name on it,

05:21.487 --> 05:24.407
we pay him to sit on the set
and nod approvingly

05:24.490 --> 05:26.826

05:26.909 --> 05:30.913

10:47.104 --> 10:49.106
Maybe it would be best if Claire...

10:49.190 --> 10:50.858
-uh, stepped--
-No, I want to hear it.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.070
Ace was, um...

10:55.488 --> 10:59.742
He was in Palm Springs for the weekend
engaging in some, um...

11:00.910 --> 11:04.038
-extracurricular activities.
-We're keeping it under wraps.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.456
-Who are you?
-Red Tettemer.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.707
Head of Publicity.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.209
No one can know about this.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.544
My reputation is at stake.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.838
-[Claire crying]
-So is my family's.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.176
[sighs]

11:19.929 --> 11:22.181
[crying quietly]

11:26.602 --> 11:28.229
There, there, darling.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.859
Is Daddy going to die?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.786
My screen test is on Friday.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.251
This is what I was worried about.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.546
Your father's on his death bed...

11:55.715 --> 11:59.260
and the thing that upsets you
is a screen test.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.097
This is what I wanted to spare you from.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.476
[Avis sighs]

12:20.948 --> 12:22.533
So what are we looking at here?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.326
Is he going to wake up?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.537
[Dick] We don't know yet.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.788
[sighs]

12:28.831 --> 12:30.040
Hello, Mrs. Amberg.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.669
Mr. Samuels.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.880
I'm Lon Silver, Ace's attorney.

12:35.963 --> 12:36.922
You're what?

12:37.423 --> 12:38.924
How have I never met you before?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.384
Well, you're meeting me now.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.345
Ace made for some very specific
arrangements

12:43.429 --> 12:45.055
in case of incapacitation,

12:45.139 --> 12:47.767
to ensure that everything would remain
business as usual.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.979
Mrs. Amberg, Ace has given you
durable power of attorney

12:52.062 --> 12:56.734
over all of his financial assets,
savings, real estate, and the studio.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.780
I, on the other hand, am in charge of all
decisions related to Ace's healthcare.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.074
[chuckles] I'm sorry,
but I think you have that backwards.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.368
Mmm. No, no, no. It's all right here.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.704
So, let me get this straight,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.290
Avis is now running the studio?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.252
Well, you'll still handle the day-to-day,
Dick, as you do now.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.880
Mrs. Amberg will oversee the finances,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.632
uh, payroll, budgets,

13:19.715 --> 13:22.092
giving the green light,
that sort of thing.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.260
Why would he do that?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.429
I don't know anything
about running a studio.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.058
I imagine Mr. Amberg felt that
moving Dick to the top spot

13:29.141 --> 13:31.310
would be seen as a kind of
changing of the guard.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.897
Your taking over as interim caretaker,
Mrs. Amberg,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.399
will better protect Ace's return
to the studio.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.611
So I'm expected to keep
Ace Studios running,

13:40.694 --> 13:44.365
produce a slate of films,
but I can't green-light a picture.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.616
That's right.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.577
Mrs. Amberg
will have sole green-light authority.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.960
Here's to a speedy recovery.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.467
[Dick] You're very talented,

14:03.551 --> 14:05.928
and you've written a wonderful script.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.972
-Thank you.
-But, unfortunately,

14:08.055 --> 14:10.224
Ace Amberg has recently

14:11.517 --> 14:13.143
become incapacitated.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.103
Oh.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.480
-[scoffs] I'm sorry to hear that.
-Well...

14:17.022 --> 14:21.902
before he became ill,
he became aware of your, um...

14:23.863 --> 14:24.780
race,

14:25.614 --> 14:26.699
and...

14:28.117 --> 14:29.618
now we need to replace you.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.998
<i>Peg</i> is still your movie.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.499
It's your...

14:36.750 --> 14:37.585
script.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.044
It's your voice.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.090
You're gonna get all your fees.
You'll be on set.

14:45.551 --> 14:49.430
But another writer's name
will be appearing in the credits.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.226
I'm sorry.
This is simply the way that it has to be.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.567
I appreciate you, Mr. Samuels,
just coming out and telling me all this.

15:02.318 --> 15:06.322
I'm guessing you didn't enjoy
having to do that.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.282
[Dick] Absolutely not.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.204
But...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.624
this is the world that we live in.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.208
Right.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.799
If Ace Amberg wants
to take my name off this picture...

15:28.844 --> 15:30.137
he can do it himself.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.056
Fair enough.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.141
As long as you're prepared
for the inevitable.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.482
Ain't nothing inevitable, Mr. Samuels.

Yeah, all we can do is show up,

16:56.932 --> 17:00.477
Now remember, this is the big
climactic scene, all right?

17:00.561 --> 17:04.023
You are the boyfriend
of a woman on the verge.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.359
She's about to end it all,
but you don't want that.

Urgent.

[shouting]
"Peg! I won't let you know I love you!"

17:35.345 --> 17:37.222
Sorry, that's... Hold on. That's not it.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.099
-I...
-[clears throat]

17:39.224 --> 17:40.893
All right, what is going on here?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.979
Did you go out drinking last night?
Were you out sucking dick?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.189
Because we talked about that.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.983
No, it's just...
There's a lot of you's and I's.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.485
The words are real similar. They--

17:49.568 --> 17:52.029
Well, frankly,
you should have this memorized by now.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.074
I'm sorry, I'm just really scared.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.367
When I think about the director

17:58.535 --> 18:00.037
sitting there watching,

18:01.663 --> 18:03.624
I keep picturing my stepdad

18:04.500 --> 18:06.293
telling me I'm nobody. Saying he's...

18:07.544 --> 18:09.129
gonna beat the shit out of me.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.758
I'm no psychologist
or whatever they call it,

18:12.841 --> 18:14.718
but if you came to this town

18:15.427 --> 18:17.930
so that your stepdad
would finally love you...

18:19.515 --> 18:21.016
The director ain't your daddy.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.310
He ain't your mommy.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.687
He is a friend.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.440
And he's there to guide you.

18:28.941 --> 18:29.775
Okay?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.486
-[Roy] Yeah.
-Okay.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.823
-Let's try it again.
-Yeah.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.953
[Roy breathing heavily]

18:42.287 --> 18:44.289
"Sam, what are you doing here?

18:44.498 --> 18:45.374
Leave me alone.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.876
This is my destiny. Mine and mine alone."

18:50.170 --> 18:51.421
Sorry, it's my line then?

19:04.810 --> 19:05.811
Hello, Jeanne.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.607
Avis, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.241
I was with Ace...

19:20.993 --> 19:22.411
in Palm Springs.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.165
We've been having an affair.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.334
For how long?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.752
Ten years.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.217
Ace always told me that he loved me
and that he was going to leave you,

19:37.301 --> 19:40.429
and he said that you were
having an affair with some guy

19:40.512 --> 19:43.390
who ran a gas station, so it was all okay.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.271
Do you love him?

19:50.564 --> 19:52.524
In the beginning, I believed I did.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.654
But after a while,
I realized that that was just a fantasy.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.326
If I tried to break it off,
then it would be over for me.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.205
So, I...

20:06.747 --> 20:07.581
I just...

20:08.290 --> 20:09.249
stayed.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.795
Avis, I know how you must feel.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.589
I know you hate me,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.425
but I am truly sorry.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.721
And I will be resigning from my contract.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.432
I'll be cleared out of here
by Monday morning.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.893
[Avis] Where will you go?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.561
I don't know.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.189
Television, probably.

20:32.814 --> 20:36.026
The Kraft Television Theatre
has expressed an interest in me.

20:37.903 --> 20:38.737
No.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.994
You're not going anywhere.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.666
And I can't be angry with you, Jeanne.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.000
If I were,

20:53.001 --> 20:54.127
I'd be a hypocrite.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.342
[voice tightening] Avis, thank you.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.640
[sighs]

21:07.391 --> 21:09.351
[Raymond] In this scene,
she's been drinking, right?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.394
But don't play it drunk,

21:10.477 --> 21:13.563
she has to drink at this point
just to feel normal, remember.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.986
"Oh, Sam, Sam, <i>Thirteen Women,</i>
isn't it wonderful?"

21:19.069 --> 21:21.154
[rapid knocking on door]

21:22.447 --> 21:23.699
Were you expecting somebody?

21:25.784 --> 21:26.618
Archie.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.788
They're taking my name off the script.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.582
-What?
-Yeah.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.793
Dick just told me.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.964
This film won't get made if they find out
a nigger wrote it.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.465
And I just sat there,

21:42.009 --> 21:46.096
taking it nice and civil 'cause
that's how we supposed to act.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.765
Well, you know what?

21:49.558 --> 21:53.270
I am finished with patience and civility!

21:53.353 --> 21:57.065
-Nobody's taking your name off anything.
-Fuck this studio head.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.152
Fuck these white people in charge!

22:00.235 --> 22:02.571
They don't play fair, so why should we?

22:02.654 --> 22:05.490
I felt like an Uncle Tom
even writing this goddamn script

22:05.574 --> 22:08.285
about this dumb-ass white girl.
That ain't my life!

22:09.453 --> 22:12.331
That ain't my story! That's <i>their</i> story!

22:12.414 --> 22:13.415
And then, still...

22:15.125 --> 22:16.293
it ain't good enough.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.669
Archie, listen to me.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.713
I'm not gonna let
any of that happen to you.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.048
You hear me?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.632
Camille...

22:24.676 --> 22:26.261
I want you to get this part.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.013
Go on and get it.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.350
Go on and get it. I'm sorry I fought you.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.227
I was fighting their fight.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.856
But now it's time to fight ours.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.401
-Okay?
-[Camille] Yeah.

22:45.822 --> 22:48.825
-Y'all was in the middle of something.
-[chuckles]

22:50.369 --> 22:51.828
[Archie] "Why, there you are.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.955
We were meant to meet for lunch at RKO."

22:54.581 --> 22:57.793
"Sam, Sam, <i>Thirteen Women,</i>
isn't it wonderful?"

22:57.876 --> 23:00.170
"But you finished filming it months ago."

23:00.253 --> 23:01.713
"Yes, I know, silly.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.716
But, the thought that it'll be
in the cinema soon...

23:04.800 --> 23:07.511
Me up there, on the silver screen.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.388
Well, I just had to read
the script again."

23:09.471 --> 23:12.474
I'm gonna stop you. Remember,
she's been drinking. She's loose.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.559
I thought you told me
not to play it like that.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.686
Yes, but I-- I mean she's...

23:16.770 --> 23:18.563
She's roiling with anxiety.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.982
The next scene, she's going to finish
a bottle of Scotch,

23:21.066 --> 23:23.068
race to the Hollywood sign
and jump off of it,

23:23.151 --> 23:25.445
so she has that inside of her.
Try it again.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.572
"I just had to read the script again,

23:27.656 --> 23:31.660
and this time, Hazel Cousins
simply jumped off the page.

23:31.743 --> 23:35.705
Wait, she's not a supporting role
at all really, she's in...

23:35.789 --> 23:38.917
I-- I counted 'em, 20-- 20 scenes.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.546
This film will really be the start
of something, Sam.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.049
At long last,
I'm going to be a movie star."

23:46.133 --> 23:48.009
-"Peg, have you been drinking?"
-"What?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.762
Well, just a little to take
the edge off because I got so excited."

23:50.846 --> 23:51.930
More emotion.

23:52.013 --> 23:56.810
"What? Well, just a little to take
the edge off because I got so excited."

23:56.893 --> 23:58.437
"Peg, I have some sorry news.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.565
I saw Mr. Selznick today.
He told me you've been cut from the film.

24:01.648 --> 24:05.444
You'll still be in two scenes, sure,
but it's a cameo now, Peg.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.820
You're barely in it at all."

24:06.903 --> 24:07.946
"And suddenly...

24:09.156 --> 24:10.782
everything goes dark again.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.536
All of my hopes and dreams

24:14.619 --> 24:17.289
lay in a heap of cut-up celluloid

24:17.372 --> 24:20.876
on the floor of an editing room
to be tossed into the trash bin.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.128
Lost.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.466
That's me, Sam.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.552
Lost and soon to be forgotten."

24:34.598 --> 24:37.267
I'll cry on the day.
I'm just not going to do it right now.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.477
That's not gonna work.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.520
If you can't bring the emotion
to the rehearsal,

24:40.604 --> 24:42.606
you're not gonna be able to
in front of the cameras.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.524
Well, maybe I'm not a crier, Raymond!

24:44.608 --> 24:47.110
Maybe I just can't manufacture
other people's emotions.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.279
This is your shot, Camille!

24:49.654 --> 24:53.408
This scene. You need to bring
every ounce of pain you've ever felt.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.160
Every rock that's been thrown at you,

24:55.243 --> 24:58.538
every word that has been spat in
your face, I need you to take that rage,

24:58.622 --> 25:00.749
that sadness, and put it into the scene!

25:01.166 --> 25:05.295
This is your chance to <i>really</i> act,
to <i>be</i> an actress!

25:07.839 --> 25:09.382
You know all about pain, don't you?

25:09.883 --> 25:12.052
Passing, every day of your life.

25:14.554 --> 25:15.597
Fucking jerk!

25:17.807 --> 25:21.394
How about you and I,
we rehearse the kissing scene?

25:26.775 --> 25:28.902
I'm sorry, I really want to, but, um...

25:31.446 --> 25:32.948
I'm trying to be a good person.

25:38.912 --> 25:39.746
Jack...

25:43.333 --> 25:44.960
You are a good person.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.879
Why do you have so many doubts about that?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.340
I'll see you at the screen test.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.722
[Jeanne] Thank you, dear.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.902
Miss Crandall, thank you so much
for agreeing to read for these tests.

26:10.986 --> 26:11.945
My pleasure.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.323
If I were 10 years younger,
I could be testing for the lead myself.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.993
It could have been
the picture that made me a star.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.620
You're not a star
because you didn't sign with me.

26:21.288 --> 26:25.875
That's right, Henry, because you're awful
and you treat your clients like dog shit.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.794
-[stage bell rings]
-[crewman] On the bell.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.421
Ready when you are, Mr. Ainsley.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.380
Rock.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.965
Right this way.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.552
So, Miss Crandall will be reading
this scene with you.

26:35.635 --> 26:38.930
This is the climactic scene
right before she jumps off.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.766
Should do it to her,
not right into the camera?

26:42.934 --> 26:43.768
That's right.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.312
This is the Hollywood sign.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.897
I'm sort of hanging off of it.
It's very, very high.

26:47.981 --> 26:48.982
Oh, boy.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.066
I see it.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.903
I haven't been this nervous since
Junior Durkin's first screen test.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.238
And you know what?

26:56.114 --> 26:56.990
He got the part.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.868
And so will you, kid. Just breathe.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.579
[both sighing heavily]

27:02.662 --> 27:03.872
[crewman] Roll camera.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.874
And... action.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.668
Sam, what are you doing here?

27:08.752 --> 27:09.669
Leave me alone.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.255
This is my destiny and mine alone.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.882
Peg, I won't let you do it!

27:14.132 --> 27:16.843
You know you love you, and you know
I won't let me throw it all away!

27:17.427 --> 27:18.345
And...

27:18.637 --> 27:20.597
Sorry, I screwed it up,
can I try it again?

27:20.680 --> 27:23.183
Cut. That's very good, Rock. Just relax.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.228
Peg, you won't let me do it!

27:27.687 --> 27:30.690
You know I love you,
and you know I won't let me throw--

27:31.399 --> 27:33.652
That's not right. Damn it, that...

27:34.361 --> 27:35.320
Right?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.782
Peg, I won't let <i>you</i> do it.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.117
You know I <i>know</i> you'll throw you away.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.495
Damn-- That's not right. I, uh--

27:44.204 --> 27:45.747
[Raymond] Rock, it's, um...

27:45.830 --> 27:48.249
[clears throat]
"Peg, I won't let you do it.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.878
You know I love you, and you know
I won't let you throw it all away."

27:51.961 --> 27:53.463
Yeah, I got it.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.257
[feigning distress]

27:59.427 --> 28:02.138
Sorry. I-- My-- my throat...
My throat's a little sore.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.139
I need some water.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.100
We need water. Get him water. Now.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.727
-[man] Water.
-Just a little bit.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.397
A glass of water
for a tall drink of water.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.399
[chuckles] You too.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.316
[Jeanne laughs]

28:15.485 --> 28:17.862
Peg, I won't let you do it! Shit!

28:17.946 --> 28:18.988
Sorry, one more time.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.490
-That was right.
-That was it.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.492
-Oh, are you serious?
-Yeah, you got this.

28:25.912 --> 28:26.996
[feigning distress]

28:27.622 --> 28:29.874
Peg, I won't let you do it.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.378
You know I love you and you know
I won't let you throw it all away.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.339
I can't, Sam.
I can't! I can't do it anymore!

28:40.593 --> 28:42.095
That was my line, darling.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.097
[stage door opens]

28:45.223 --> 28:47.142
-[stage door slams]
-[Raymond groans]

28:49.394 --> 28:51.104
[Raymond] All right, one more, Rock.

28:52.981 --> 28:53.982
I can't, Sam.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.610
[crying] I don't want any part
of this life anymore.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.530
And that includes you, Sam.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.866
Well, what did you tell me about
killing yourself?

29:03.324 --> 29:06.911
When all those Wall Street so-and-so's
lost their fortunes and ended it all,

29:07.746 --> 29:12.000
you told me, "Sam, they picked a long-term
solution to a short-term problem."

29:13.168 --> 29:15.754
-And that's what you're doing now, Peg!
-[screaming]

29:15.837 --> 29:18.840
No!

29:19.549 --> 29:21.009
[groans]

29:22.761 --> 29:24.012
[Raymond] And cut.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.431
-That's uh... That's all we need.
-[stage bell rings]

29:26.765 --> 29:28.808
Well, thank you so much
for the opportunity.

29:31.352 --> 29:32.187
Thank you.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.110
[stuttering]
I'm real sorry, Miss Crandall.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.112
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.156
Please, we've all been there.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.616
Come on.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.078
You got it right in the end,
and that's what really matters.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.095
How do you feel?

30:06.429 --> 30:08.723
Like I want to run away
and never come back.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.776
At the end,
he wants us to really cry, and...

30:21.986 --> 30:23.738
I've tried, I just can't.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.620
Here, uh...

30:32.413 --> 30:33.581
rub a little...

30:35.416 --> 30:37.544
VapoRub under your eyes.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.505
It's not a prank. It works.
But just use a tiny bit.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.715
We're ready for you, Miss Wood.

30:45.718 --> 30:48.388
Really, it, uh, gets the waterworks going.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.191
-[slate clacks]
-[Raymond] Action.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.695
This film will really be the start
of something, Sam.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.532
At long last,
I'm going to be a movie star.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.325
"Have you been drinking, Peg?"

31:09.409 --> 31:12.620
[chuckling] Just to take the edge off
because I got so excited.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.664
[reader] "I saw Mr. Selznick.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.833
He told me you've been cut from the film.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.919
You'll appear in two scenes, sure,
but it's a cameo now, Peg.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.713
You're barely in it at all."

31:30.430 --> 31:31.598
And suddenly it's...

31:32.473 --> 31:33.516
dark again.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.314
All my hopes and dreams...

31:46.112 --> 31:49.699
to be tossed into the trash bin. Lost.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.412
That's me, Sam. Lost.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.581
Lost and soon to be forgotten.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.002
Thank you so much, Mr. Ainsley.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.756
[Raymond] Cut.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.674
-[stage bell rings]
-Camille Washington.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.718
[crewman] All right,
you heard him. Set up.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.348
[Raymond] No.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.350
No, Camille. Camille, no.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.851
I'm not gonna let you cheat.

32:17.685 --> 32:18.978
[Camille sighs]

32:20.647 --> 32:22.190
Baby, I know you can do this.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.069
This is your shot
to make this role your own.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.072
But it's you who has to make that happen.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.075
Go get 'em.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.577
Okay, let's slate.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.040
Avis, I am so sorry.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.376
You have my deepest sympathies.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.087
-How did you find out?
-Through the grapevine.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.130
Don't worry, it's still very hush-hush.

32:46.923 --> 32:50.718
But, I am so excited about this <i>Peg</i> movie.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.597
You know, my client, Rock Hudson,
would be perfect for it.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.224
His acting is just...

32:57.600 --> 32:59.978
Honestly, he's like a Barrymore.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.400
Anyway, I cannot imagine the strain
you must be under right now,

33:05.483 --> 33:11.572
which is why I was very glad to be able
to take a little something off your plate.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.865
What, Henry?

33:14.367 --> 33:15.243
You don't know?

33:17.286 --> 33:18.162
Oh, dear.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.174
<i>Tattletale</i> <i>Magazine</i> is in possession
of some photographs

33:30.258 --> 33:33.344
of you leaving that gas station

33:34.303 --> 33:35.680
with various gentlemen.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.517
Now I, of course, bought back the photos.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.353
I would never want that to get out.

33:42.937 --> 33:43.938
What do you want?

33:44.981 --> 33:46.524
My client in the picture.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.777
I want you to cast Rock.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.577
You're a real snake, Henry.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.330
But you already know that.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.382

-[Raymond] Sixty-seven.

35:53.568 --> 35:54.485
I've seen enough.

35:56.070 --> 35:56.946
I like him.

35:57.780 --> 35:58.781
Let's cast him.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.992
Sixty-seven takes, Avis.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.994
I think he's right for the part.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.372
We tested other actors.
Can we at least watch one of them?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.963
<i>What did you tell me</i>
<i>about killing yourself?</i>

36:14.046 --> 36:17.884
<i>When all those Wall Street so-and-so's</i>
<i>lost their fortunes and ended it all,</i>

36:18.551 --> 36:22.305
<i>you said, "Sam, they picked a long-term</i>
<i>solution to a short-term problem."</i>

36:22.805 --> 36:24.807
<i>Well, that's what you're doing now, Peg.</i>

36:25.725 --> 36:27.393
<i>No!</i>

36:28.436 --> 36:29.270
He's good.

36:30.813 --> 36:31.647
Yes.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.441
Let's give it to him.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.484
What did I say?

36:35.943 --> 36:39.155
I have to go. I'm late for a luncheon
with Eleanor Roosevelt.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.782
Avis, what about Peg?
Who are we going to cast?

36:41.866 --> 36:43.868
Well, it's obvious,
we have to give it to Claire.

36:43.951 --> 36:45.411
She wasn't as good.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.914
Believe me,
casting her pains me more than anyone.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.498
She's my daughter. I can't stand her.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.416
Uh, Mrs. Amberg.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.585
Please tell your girlfriend...

36:53.419 --> 36:54.629
she was stunning.

36:55.546 --> 36:59.550
She gave an amazing screen test,
but she's not right for the part.

37:00.134 --> 37:03.554
Well, with a slight rewrite, she...
she might be right.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.306
She's a movie star.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.475
Don't make me into the bad guy here.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.604
What do you want me to say?
What's Ace going to say?

37:11.687 --> 37:12.688
Ace isn't here.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.775
This is your decision to make right now,
Avis.

37:16.108 --> 37:16.984
Exactly.

37:17.526 --> 37:21.072
And my decision is to not bankrupt
this studio, Dick.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.951
We will reap the whirlwind
if we cast that girl,

37:25.034 --> 37:27.203
and everyone in this room knows it.

37:27.703 --> 37:31.749
I am not about to take that risk
when we have a perfectly fine alternative,

37:31.832 --> 37:34.001
who's going to become
so goddamn unbearable

37:34.085 --> 37:35.586
-you have no idea.
-Avis...

37:35.962 --> 37:38.297
You don't keep
Eleanor Roosevelt waiting, Dick!

37:39.006 --> 37:40.091
[door slams]

37:41.259 --> 37:43.886
Josephine, call Jack Castello
into my office, please.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.054
[Josephine] Yes, sir.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.140
Well, Jack, you got the part.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.434
-Yes! Yes!
-[Ellen chuckling]

37:50.601 --> 37:51.769
Uh, sorry, thank you.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.980
Congratulations, kid,
you've proven me wrong.

37:54.063 --> 37:57.024
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Samuels.
I will not disappoint you.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.025
Thank you.

38:04.740 --> 38:05.950
I got the part.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.203
I got the part!

38:12.790 --> 38:13.958
So that's it.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.127
No notice?

38:16.210 --> 38:18.129
That's how you thank your old pal Ernie?

38:18.212 --> 38:20.214
Listen, Ern, you've been a big help,
you know that.

38:20.298 --> 38:24.176
But I have been having moral reservations.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.887
Oh, you have, have you?

38:28.764 --> 38:30.433
No prude like an old whore.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.811
You're just like the rest of them, Jack.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.398
Suddenly, you're all squeaky clean, huh?

38:38.065 --> 38:41.444
You know damn well deep down
you're just as seedy as the rest of us.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.072
So you can shove that halo all the way up
your ass as far as I'm concerned.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.741
[coughing] You're full of shit.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.785
[coughing heavily]

38:50.786 --> 38:52.121
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jack.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.583
I'm happy for you. It's just that...

38:57.877 --> 39:00.671
I thought I found my way out
of the game, too, you know?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.591
It was all bullshit!

39:04.050 --> 39:06.469
-What are you talking about, Ernie?
-Vivien Leigh.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.388
I was reading lines with her all night
at Cukor's.

39:09.472 --> 39:12.183
I try to give that to people.
Don't turn the light on!

39:12.266 --> 39:15.936
I was fool enough
to believe you were straight!

39:16.771 --> 39:19.273
Oh, Ernie. You are fantastic.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.776
So honest and unveneered.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.985
You should be acting.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.696
-What are you talking about?
-No, I'm serious.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.573
You should be in this production.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.076
She said I should be in the play.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.913
She was gonna set a meeting
with Tennessee Williams.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.123
He never called me.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.334
I had dreams too, you know.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.503
[chuckling] What am I talking--

39:40.878 --> 39:42.755
Congratulations, Jack. Here's--

39:42.838 --> 39:44.048
-Ernie...
-No, no, no.

39:44.131 --> 39:47.343
Here's 50 bucks to tide you over
until you start shooting, okay?

39:47.927 --> 39:51.972
Come back when you're a big star
and say hello, okay?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.350
Okay. Thanks, Ern.

39:56.936 --> 39:57.937
[Ernie coughs]

40:03.025 --> 40:06.278
I knew it when I saw you in that bar.
You were going places, kid.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.329
I knew it before they did.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.215
And so...

40:26.757 --> 40:29.760
it has very much lifted my spirits

40:30.052 --> 40:33.597
to see that over $3,000

40:33.681 --> 40:37.309
has been raised in a single afternoon.

40:38.936 --> 40:44.275
Thank you so much for your support,
and please enjoy your lunch.

40:45.025 --> 40:46.986
These fucking shoes.

40:47.069 --> 40:51.490
-Those heels are one inch.
-Well, that one inch is killing me.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.450
[Avis chuckles]

40:53.242 --> 40:54.368
How's Ace?

40:54.452 --> 40:57.037
He's out of commission
for a little while, actually.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.789
Probably just a virus.

40:59.540 --> 41:03.377
-He's at home resting comfortably.
-Who's running the studio?

41:03.836 --> 41:06.297
I am. Very much in name only.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.590
Oh, Avis,

41:08.132 --> 41:11.302
that is positively divine.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.512
What's it like?

41:14.096 --> 41:15.931
What movies are you working on?

41:16.182 --> 41:17.183
Well...

41:17.266 --> 41:20.895
we just did some screen tests
on a film about Peg Entwistle.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.482
Oh, yes, I remember when that happened.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.568
-Oh, that sounds gripping.
-Yes.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.488
But, well, I feel guilty.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.991
The girl we're going to give the lead to
wasn't the best.

41:34.074 --> 41:37.286
There was a girl that was far better,
but she's colored.

41:43.834 --> 41:44.668
What?

41:47.463 --> 41:48.964
[phone ringing]

41:49.423 --> 41:50.799
Office of Dick Samuels.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.844
Wait, who?

41:55.930 --> 41:57.181
She's coming now?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.642
[crowd chattering]

42:15.241 --> 42:17.910
-Eleanor, this is Dick Samuels.
-How do you do, Mrs. Roosevelt?

42:17.993 --> 42:19.703
-Ellen Kincaid.
-So wonderful to meet you.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.913
It's a pleasure.

42:20.996 --> 42:22.456
-Right this way.
-Thank you.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.542
[applause]

42:26.043 --> 42:29.964
These past few years I have been
traveling all over the country,

42:30.047 --> 42:34.009
and what I have seen going on
in the South

42:35.803 --> 42:39.807
has positively shaken
my faith in this country.

42:40.432 --> 42:43.227
Here I thought we fought a war

42:44.061 --> 42:45.271
for freedom,

42:46.146 --> 42:47.022
for...

42:47.731 --> 42:49.233
basic decency.

42:50.442 --> 42:53.862
Then, to see Jim Crow up close, those...

42:54.863 --> 42:57.157
the beatings and the lynchings.

42:58.409 --> 43:03.956
I have begun to realize that this country
is actually moving backwards.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.666
Now...

43:06.792 --> 43:08.877
I understand that...

43:10.296 --> 43:13.048
you have the opportunity

43:13.132 --> 43:17.761
to cast a girl of color
as the lead in one of your pictures.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.348
I am here to encourage you to do it.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.143
Mrs. Roosevelt...

43:26.437 --> 43:27.980
I couldn't agree more.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.482
Miss Kincaid?

43:32.318 --> 43:36.238
I wholeheartedly agree with Richard,
Mrs. Roosevelt.

43:36.322 --> 43:37.406
Okay, I'm sorry.

43:37.489 --> 43:42.453
While I greatly admire the bleeding hearts
of my dear colleagues here,

43:42.536 --> 43:45.539
if we cast this girl in the lead role,

43:45.623 --> 43:47.875
the picture will not run in the South.

43:48.834 --> 43:51.629
-Run it in the North.
-The picture will face a boycott.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.673
Production on our slate of films
will grind to a halt.

43:54.757 --> 43:58.177
This studio,
as well as everyone who works here,

43:58.260 --> 44:01.639
will become a target of the Ku Klux Klan.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.058
That's the long and short of it.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.060
That's why we just...

44:06.727 --> 44:07.770
We can't do it.

44:08.437 --> 44:10.064
Yes, it will be...

44:11.231 --> 44:12.483
a big to-do.

44:15.361 --> 44:18.906
Think about it, what it might mean to a...

44:21.367 --> 44:23.827
to a dirt poor

44:24.411 --> 44:26.747
little black girl living

44:27.623 --> 44:30.292
in a shanty in some...

44:31.293 --> 44:35.589
cotton town where she's told she's free,

44:35.673 --> 44:38.550
but really her life is no better

44:38.634 --> 44:40.719
than that of her grandparents,

44:41.387 --> 44:46.809
who were the owned property
of another human being.

44:47.976 --> 44:54.650
Think about her, what it would mean to...
to see herself up there on that screen.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.611
Vaunted, dignified...

44:59.738 --> 45:00.739
valued.

45:01.448 --> 45:05.661
My time in Washington taught me...

45:06.578 --> 45:07.705
[scoffs]

45:08.163 --> 45:09.373
...a lot of things.

45:09.998 --> 45:15.629
I used to believe that good government
could change the world.

45:15.713 --> 45:19.299
Well, I don't know that
I believe that anymore.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.843
However, what you do,

45:22.219 --> 45:23.345
the three of you,

45:24.638 --> 45:27.808
can change the world.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.564
[sniffles] Now, if you will excuse me,

45:35.065 --> 45:37.526
I'm meeting Hick for dinner at 5:00.

45:38.694 --> 45:39.945
[door opens]

45:40.404 --> 45:41.989
[Eleanor whispering] Thank you.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.870
So, what are you going to do?

45:59.506 --> 46:02.092
[big band music playing]
