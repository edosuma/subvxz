01:02.350 --> 01:06.980
How do you break something
you don't even use?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.990
<i>Hi, you've reached Frankie.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

01:15.070 --> 01:16.070
Hey, Frankie--

01:16.150 --> 01:17.910
<i>But in case you don't, in a moment or so,</i>

01:17.990 --> 01:20.080
<i>you're going to hear a beeping noise.</i>

01:21.370 --> 01:23.580
-OK--
<i>-That's your cue to record a message,</i>

01:23.660 --> 01:27.540
<i>which I will later play</i>
<i>and return at my leisure.</i>

01:27.620 --> 01:29.330
-Frankie--
<i>-Hola!</i>

01:29.420 --> 01:33.090
<i>Este es el tel√©fono del Frankie.</i>

01:33.170 --> 01:35.970
Oh, for the love of--

01:36.680 --> 01:39.050
Hey, girl. Um...

01:39.140 --> 01:41.720
I just--
I'm calling to see if you're up yet.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.310
And, uh, there's just one little thing
that I want to talk to you about.

01:45.390 --> 01:48.350
Don't worry,
it's not about the dishwasher.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.620
Jefferson Starship, Sol!

01:59.700 --> 02:03.950
-What are you doing here?
-I'm sorry. I was just...

02:04.040 --> 02:05.700
resting here.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.080
All night.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.210
You told him.

02:11.290 --> 02:14.340
I did. I did.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.340
Oh, God. What happened?

02:17.050 --> 02:18.970
Well, I slept on your patio.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.760
-Are you OK?
-No. It was terrible.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.220
He was so shocked. So hurt.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.640
And then so furious.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.940
Like he wanted to push me down the stairs.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.980
You told him at the top of the stairs?

02:32.060 --> 02:36.320
No, we were in the kitchen.
It's just the way he looked at me.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.070
What have I done?

02:44.030 --> 02:45.290
Oh.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.210
No.

02:48.290 --> 02:52.540
Damn my Christ-like capacity
for compassion.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.210
I'm sorry, Sol.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.470
-I am.
-I don't know what to do.

03:00.550 --> 03:04.510
Me neither.
It's a lot for 8:16 in the morning.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.100
Let's go inside.
We're gonna need some java.

03:09.180 --> 03:12.100
-What's in the mug?
-Butterscotch pudding.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.150
Well, Frankie, what happened this time?

03:21.240 --> 03:23.620
Were you trying to see
if you could fit in there?

03:23.700 --> 03:27.240
Or did you stand on the door to see
into the neighbor's outdoor shower?

03:27.330 --> 03:31.750
If you must know, I was very tired
and I forgot which way it opens from.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.250
But right now we have bigger fish to fry.

03:36.170 --> 03:37.340
I'm the fish.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.050
He spent the night on our patio.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.800
-I told Robert.
-You didn't.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.300
I had to.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.390
But he's barely over his heart attack.

03:45.470 --> 03:47.970
Trust me, if you'd been there
you would have done the same thing.

03:48.060 --> 03:51.940
I couldn't go one more minute
with that lie between us.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.060
So you just left him there alone?

03:54.150 --> 03:57.110
Well, he started shouting

03:57.190 --> 03:59.740
"get out, get out, get out."

03:59.820 --> 04:01.110
I didn't know what to do,

04:01.190 --> 04:05.320
so I started reciting this poem
I referenced in my vows.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.660
Oh, good Lord, no.

04:06.740 --> 04:12.120
"The varietals of orchids are as varied
as the varietals of my love."

04:12.210 --> 04:14.500
Sol, that was not a good poem.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.880
It was a very, very, very bad choice.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.260
I have to go back.
I have to at least check on him.

04:21.339 --> 04:25.640
No, not you. You can't.
He won't even let you in the door.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.640
-I have to do something.
-I'll go make sure he's OK.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.770
- For right now, you just stay here.
- Oh!

04:30.850 --> 04:35.440
Can I say that I'm concerned
about the "stay here" part?

04:35.520 --> 04:39.270
I hate to ask, but if you're going,
could you please get my wallet?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.150
I ran out without it.
It's right on the table in the foyer.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.360
Sure.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.740
It's salmon-colored raffia
woven in the shape of a tortoise.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.540
-I remember.
-It says "Chill Out" on it.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.210
-I remember.
-You're sure you're OK doing this?

04:53.290 --> 04:55.920
I've learned to live with
a very flexible definition of "OK."

04:59.340 --> 05:01.590
You just hug yourself for a second.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.130
I will be right back.

05:06.550 --> 05:09.760
- You can't leave me here with Sol.
- Take it easy.

05:09.850 --> 05:13.310
Once I know that Robert's still standing
and I've removed some sharp objects,

05:13.390 --> 05:15.690
I'll grab Sol's children's wallet
and come right home.

05:15.770 --> 05:19.690
I haven't seen Sol since
that karmic shit-storm at the hospital

05:19.770 --> 05:22.230
and now I'm supposed to hang out
with him in my kitchen?

05:22.320 --> 05:25.450
Once I get him his credit card,
he'll be the exclusive responsibility

05:25.530 --> 05:28.110
-of JW Marriott.
-But until then--

05:28.200 --> 05:32.540
You're gonna be fine, Frankie.
You can do this. Go paint.

05:32.620 --> 05:36.000
You love high school talent shows,
there's always one of those going on.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.790
-OK, I'll look.
-OK. First, fix my dishwasher.

05:45.170 --> 05:48.470
-I remember this thing was always--
-No, no, no.

05:48.550 --> 05:51.050
-I don't need you to do that.
-Frankie,

05:51.140 --> 05:53.430
I'll be out of here as soon as I can.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.600
In the meantime,
I was just trying to be useful.

05:56.730 --> 05:57.690
Can I make you some tea?

05:57.770 --> 06:00.770
Oh, well-- No, no. Leave it.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.480
-That's how Grace likes it.
-Are you OK?

06:03.570 --> 06:06.280
Well, no. I would actually like some tea.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.740
But if you make it,
then I'll decide that we also need toast,

06:09.820 --> 06:13.700
-which we will inevitably put jam on.
-I'm actually not very hungry, but--

06:13.790 --> 06:15.660
And if we're doing
a continental breakfast,

06:15.750 --> 06:17.750
the next thing you know,
we'll have <i> Parade</i> magazine out

06:17.830 --> 06:20.920
and we'll be laughing at those people
who want to know where Urkel went

06:21.000 --> 06:25.340
and I cannot dance
that toxic merengue with you again.

06:25.420 --> 06:28.800
-OK. I get it.
-I've got to get out of here.

06:50.030 --> 06:52.530
There you are.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.620
I brought you a croissant.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.960
Well, most of a croissant. I ate
some of it driving around looking for you.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.620
This is a big place.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.000
Oh, I didn't know you were coming over.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.090
I didn't either.
And I suddenly found myself in the car

07:06.170 --> 07:09.590
driving over to see my...
my special man-friend.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.010
I'm always happy to see you, but, uh,

07:12.090 --> 07:14.140
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

07:14.220 --> 07:16.060
What kind of something? Can I help?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.770
No, no. I've got it covered.

07:17.850 --> 07:21.190
What--
What's in there? Are you hiding something?

07:21.270 --> 07:22.940
Of course not.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.770
Well, then why won't you let me go in?

07:25.860 --> 07:29.820
Well, it's, um...
It's just a bad time.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.490
Why? Is this a meth lab?

07:33.030 --> 07:36.280
Are you building
a Japanese fighting robot?

07:37.080 --> 07:37.950
Is it a woman?

07:38.040 --> 07:40.290
Frankie, come on.

07:40.370 --> 07:44.540
Then just tell me the truth.
I can't take any more secrets and lies.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.130
All right. Come on.

07:49.130 --> 07:52.050
Come on. It's OK.

07:53.470 --> 07:54.510
Creepy.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.680
This is what I'm doing.

08:01.730 --> 08:05.110
Archery? You secretly run a summer camp?

08:05.900 --> 08:08.070
You steal from the rich
and give to the poor?

08:08.150 --> 08:11.110
That is a noble pursuit. But no.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.360
Then what am I looking at here?

08:14.450 --> 08:17.740
There's a boar who's been eating
my chickens and my melons

08:17.830 --> 08:19.580
and my bicycle pump.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.790
So you're gonna kill him?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.750
-That's the plan.
-Thank heaven. I thought, uh,

08:25.830 --> 08:29.130
maybe a farmer's daughter
might pop out of the hay.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.960
Wait a minute. You're hunting?

08:32.130 --> 08:36.340
No, this is horrible.
I have a huge problem with this.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.679
Exactly why I tried to keep it from you.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.390
Oh, yeah, that was really smart.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.600
Yeah.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.690
What can I do for you?

08:49.150 --> 08:50.570
Are you hungry?

08:51.610 --> 08:54.650
-Not really.
-You have to eat.

08:54.740 --> 08:57.700
Come on, Dad. Something healthy?

08:57.780 --> 09:01.290
Something greasy? Huh? Huh?

09:01.370 --> 09:02.790
The neighbors said we can
use their address

09:02.870 --> 09:05.290
for all the pizza places
that have blackballed Mom.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.710
It's OK, Bud.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.710
I had a banana.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.590
Dad, I'm so sorry.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.720
-Do you want to talk about it?
-I'm not sure I'm ready to.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.180
OK. Well, let's talk about that.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.220
I really appreciate your coming over,

09:22.310 --> 09:24.680
but there's really nothing
you can do for me.

09:24.770 --> 09:28.230
No, no, no,
I'm not leaving you hanging in that chair.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.070
This is the Lifetime movie
where I walk out the door

09:30.150 --> 09:32.400
thinking you're OK and then
you're Heather Locklear in a red dress

09:32.480 --> 09:34.190
stepping in front of a bus.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.920
-What was that?
-It's nothing, it's nothing.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.630
It's something. It's something
with the McCarthy divorce.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.460
But don't worry, I'm taking care of it.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.510
Wait, I thought they were going to settle.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.550
Little hiccup. She shot him.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.380
-What?
-Just in the foot.

09:58.470 --> 10:02.810
-OK? Don't worry about it.
-Oh, God, was he cheating?

10:02.890 --> 10:06.230
I know Robert doesn't have a gun,
but they're so easy to get.

10:06.310 --> 10:09.270
OK, you really should not be dealing
with acrimonious divorces right now.

10:09.350 --> 10:14.480
Oh, my God, work. I've got to prepare
the deposition for Monday.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.530
Dad. I got it.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.700
I'll take care of everything.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.330
That's right.
You just get in your chair. And swing.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.080
Knock things over.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.750
-Grace.
-Robert.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.590
-How are you?
-This isn't a good time.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.550
Well, I-I know.
I came to see if you were OK.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.760
How did you kno-- Of course.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.050
He's with Frankie. Where else would he be?

10:41.970 --> 10:44.350
-Is that all you have to say? Huh?
-What else is there?

10:44.430 --> 10:45.930
Unless you came here to gloat.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.390
Don't be shitty with me.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.810
I was actually worried
about how you were doing.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.690
How do you think I'm doing?

10:53.770 --> 10:56.860
Well, you know what, I have
a pretty good idea how you were doing.

10:56.940 --> 11:00.780
You think one night of betrayal is bad?
Try 20 years of, what,

11:00.860 --> 11:03.280
-two to three betrayals a week--
-I know! I get it, Grace.

11:03.370 --> 11:05.450
I do not have the moral high ground.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.330
Well, then why are you acting like you do?

11:07.410 --> 11:10.830
Because he knew I could forgive
almost anything but this, with her.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.630
Oh, get over yourself.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.210
Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.840
And married me 24 hours
after he did the stupid thing he did!

11:18.920 --> 11:22.010
He wanted to tell you,
but I wouldn't let him.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.800
Not before you went into surgery.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.020
-So you knew?
-Yes. Everyone did.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.640
Why-- What does it matter now?

11:33.270 --> 11:36.570
It doesn't anymore. It's over.

11:36.650 --> 11:40.070
Thank you very much for coming.
As you can see, I'm fine.

11:40.150 --> 11:44.780
Oh, there you go.
There's the Robert I know.

11:44.870 --> 11:49.330
Closed down, shut off, just like every
time we fought when we were married.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.750
This isn't that. I'm right and he's wrong.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.540
Oh, of course. You won the argument.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.840
You always do. You're a great lawyer.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.130
But every time you won with me,
you just proved

12:00.210 --> 12:03.430
you cared more about the argument
than you did about me.

12:03.510 --> 12:05.600
And I hated you for it.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.810
Robert,
this is the great love of your life.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.520
And you're just gonna throw it away?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.100
I didn't throw it away. He did.

12:14.600 --> 12:19.360
You have a chance to handle something
differently for once in your life.

12:20.570 --> 12:21.820
You might want to try it.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.030
You know, otherwise you're just gonna be
the same sulky,

12:24.110 --> 12:27.740
self-righteous block of marble
you were with me.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.500
I'm gonna leave you
to develop your sense of irony.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.170
Wait.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.920
What?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.970
He's gonna need his glasses too.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.520
And you're not gonna need this.

12:53.850 --> 12:57.110
Once again,
it's not a little rabbit named Fred.

12:57.190 --> 12:59.900
It's a boar in the woods
who's been terrorizing my farm.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.940
Allegedly.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.450
Look, Jacob, I get that you
have to do what you have to do.

13:04.530 --> 13:05.570
Thank you.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.460
You know I can see you.

13:22.550 --> 13:24.130
I can't help it.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.380
I'm a member of PETA.

13:26.470 --> 13:30.300
I own humane no-kill mosquito traps.

13:30.390 --> 13:33.430
I never wear pleather
for fear of glamorizing it.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.020
Well, for the record,
I don't like hunting either.

13:36.100 --> 13:40.690
But I can't exactly sit down
and draw up a peace accord with a boar.

13:40.770 --> 13:44.320
Have you tried? I mean,
animals are getting smarter every day.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.160
Instead of hunting, wouldn't you
like to go to a high school talent show?

13:49.240 --> 13:53.040
-I need a happy distraction.
-From what?

13:54.620 --> 13:58.330
Frankie, why did you
really come out here today?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.500
I dig you.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.260
I mean, that's before I found out
you were Ted Nugent.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.220
So what is it?

14:06.300 --> 14:10.850
You don't want to hear about the Chilean
soap opera that's become my life.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.100
Actually, I do.

14:12.180 --> 14:16.180
I'm your guy. I want to hear everything.

14:16.270 --> 14:20.270
Besides, my sister's coming to town
and I'll need to unload later.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.190
-I look forward to it.
-Yeah.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.860
-You hungry?
-Depends. What have you got?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.200
Hey, how's he doing?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.830
Well, the good news is I...
I got your wallet.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.340
Thank you. And the bad news?

14:45.420 --> 14:48.340
It may be a while
before you see the matching belt.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.340
Oy. What did he say?

14:50.430 --> 14:53.390
Not... Not much, actually.

14:54.010 --> 14:56.560
When do you think
he'll be ready to see me?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.600
Not today.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.360
Probably not tomorrow.
Certainly not the day after.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.280
I'm sorry,
I'm not very good at sugarcoating things.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.070
You have other fine qualities.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.990
That's a nice set-up you have there.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.280
Oh, I'm sorry. I borrowed your computer.

15:13.370 --> 15:17.700
I was gonna use Frankie's,
but it was fused shut with apple butter.

15:19.370 --> 15:20.870
Why did you come here, Sol?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.540
I had to. I didn't have my wallet.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.500
You could've called friends,
you could've gone to the boys.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.460
You could've gone anywhere.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.720
I was upset. It was late.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.260
And you came here,
to our house, to her house.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.220
This is the worst possible place
you could have come.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.680
For him and for Frankie.

15:45.310 --> 15:50.150
Sol, you don't walk out on your person,
then get kicked out by your new person,

15:50.240 --> 15:52.740
and come crawling back to your old person!

15:52.820 --> 15:54.320
It was just for the night.

15:54.410 --> 15:58.120
Even for a night.
It doesn't work that way.

15:58.870 --> 16:02.080
Amazingly, you managed to make
the man you cheated on

16:02.170 --> 16:04.540
even more angry with you
'cause you came here.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.750
You just can't--
You can't do these things, Sol.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.090
-This is why you irritate people.
-I irritate people?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.510
Yes!

16:14.590 --> 16:15.850
You're right.

16:16.930 --> 16:20.060
It was wrong of me
to drag both of you back into this.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.810
I never should have come here.

16:23.230 --> 16:26.440
I was looking for that safe place.
Frankie was always that for me.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.820
I guess, sometimes,
there is no safe place.

16:29.820 --> 16:33.860
"No one saves us but ourselves.
We ourselves must walk the path."

16:33.950 --> 16:36.700
-That's the Buddha.
-I'm pretty sure that's about death.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.580
I'm really not choosing quotes well today.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.870
I'm gonna go. Can I just use your computer
one more time to get a hotel?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.710
Of course.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.300
There's an alert here.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.170
Someone named Phil Milstein

16:52.260 --> 16:53.590
wants to be your friend.

16:53.670 --> 16:54.720
Ow!

16:55.680 --> 16:58.470
So what's going on with Sol?

16:58.550 --> 17:01.020
I don't want to mention his name
around you.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.230
Let's give him a different name.

17:04.310 --> 17:08.109
Paddy. Paddy told Robert about us.

17:08.190 --> 17:11.780
Robert kicked him out
and Paddy showed up at my place.

17:11.859 --> 17:15.400
So you're trying to get away from Paddy?

17:15.490 --> 17:18.240
Well, yeah.
I don't want to feel sorry for him.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.700
But you do.

17:19.780 --> 17:24.369
I don't know if I feel sorry for him
or if I just, you know...

17:24.460 --> 17:26.500
-feel sorry.
-For yourself?

17:26.579 --> 17:29.090
-No.
-Then for Robert.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.420
Why the hell would I feel sorry
for somebody

17:31.500 --> 17:33.840
who slept with my husband for 20 years?

17:34.470 --> 17:35.340
You tell me.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.430
I actually used to like Robert. We...

17:38.510 --> 17:42.180
We had some good times
making fun of Grace together.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.270
Like the time she got in trouble
with the lifeguards

17:45.350 --> 17:48.060
because she brought her own whistle
to the beach.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.560
Why would she do that?

17:49.650 --> 17:53.570
Because she was hypervigilant
about jellyfish.

17:54.740 --> 17:59.700
We got in some quality burns
at Grace's expense that day.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.280
Sounds to me like you miss him.

18:01.370 --> 18:04.450
What about this
are you not understanding, mister?

18:04.540 --> 18:08.420
Why would I miss Robert and why the hell
would I feel sorry for him?

18:08.500 --> 18:13.130
Because you know what it's like
to love Sol and lose him.

18:23.350 --> 18:24.970
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.980
How's Dad?

18:27.060 --> 18:30.020
Oy. When I left him,

18:30.100 --> 18:32.730
he was obsessing about
how Robert is going to shoot him.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.610
Well, it is so easy to get a gun.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.860
Don't get up. I'm good.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.740
-What's that?
-It's from the adoption agency.

18:44.830 --> 18:46.370
-What does it say?
-I don't know.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.540
-I haven't opened it yet.
-Why not?

18:48.620 --> 18:51.250
Because it's either
my birth mother's phone number,

18:51.330 --> 18:55.800
or-or very, very cold language
saying she never wants to meet me.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.300
Yeah, that's big.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.340
Could you open it?

19:02.390 --> 19:04.600
Uh, I really don't think so.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.680
I opened all
your college admissions letters.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.520
Those were foregone conclusions.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.060
Who's going to reject
a minority Model UN delegate

19:12.150 --> 19:15.900
whose "Cyrano" drew comparisons
to a young Derek Jacobi?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.490
-Georgetown.
-That was my reach.

19:17.570 --> 19:21.160
Look, if you don't want to open it,
don't open it.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.280
No, I do want to open it.
I just want you to open it first.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.370
I'm not opening it.
Stop asking me to do things.

19:26.450 --> 19:29.370
You know how important this is to me!
What's your deal today?

19:29.460 --> 19:32.380
My deal is our father who is a mess

19:32.460 --> 19:35.090
is camped out at the house
of our mother, of all people,

19:35.170 --> 19:37.420
and starting Monday,
I'm working in an office with,

19:37.510 --> 19:42.090
I guess, my now
soon-to-be-ex-stepfather-boss-uncle

19:42.180 --> 19:44.930
whose workload I've been carrying
because he had a stupid heart attack,

19:45.010 --> 19:48.310
and now I've got to deal with you
and whatever fresh catastrophe

19:48.390 --> 19:49.850
is awaiting us in here!

19:55.560 --> 19:59.400
Uh...

19:59.490 --> 20:02.450
That was some top of the line processing,
Jacob.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.410
-Not bad for a farmer.
-Hmm.

20:04.490 --> 20:06.490
I know my way in and around an emotion.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.000
You do. But let's not keep secrets
from each other, OK?

20:10.080 --> 20:12.500
Sorry. I won't do it again.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.050
Can we do that again?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.560
In the spirit of not keeping secrets...

20:29.890 --> 20:33.770
I hid your, um,
hunting tarp in the slop basin.

20:33.850 --> 20:36.360
And I threw the rope
in that field over there.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.860
But I don't have much of an arm.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.910
OK, bye.

20:46.990 --> 20:50.240
-I am going to go now.
-No! No. You're not going anywhere.

20:50.330 --> 20:52.540
Ten minutes ago,
you couldn't wait to get rid of me.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.040
Yeah, well, that was ten minutes ago.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.750
I need a girlfriend to talk to
and you're the only one here.

20:56.830 --> 20:59.710
-As flattering as that is--
-Wait, wait, wait.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.470
Tell me,
should I accept Phil's friend thing?

21:03.550 --> 21:06.550
What's the big deal?
I'm friends with our neighbor's cat.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.510
-Peachez with a "z."
-Well, this is Phil with a "Ph."

21:10.560 --> 21:12.100
Oh, God.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.270
Wow. That's Phil Milstein?

21:17.350 --> 21:21.320
-That's not what I was picturing.
-I know.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.570
He changed his profile picture.
He was a Rottweiler.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.030
I mean, you know, the picture.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.070
You're actually nervous, aren't you?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.620
I can see why.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.450
There's about ten people in the world
who can pull off that mustache

21:33.540 --> 21:34.830
and he's nine of them.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.250
Who is he?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.210
Just a... friend.

21:39.290 --> 21:40.960
A very handsome friend.

21:42.090 --> 21:44.760
And he's a contractor so he's strong.

21:45.590 --> 21:46.630
Wait a second.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.090
Was this the guy
who did your kitchen years ago?

21:49.180 --> 21:52.310
Yes. But that's all he did.

21:52.390 --> 21:56.560
-But there was something.
-There was something.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.230
Oh, I don't know.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.980
-What do I do? What do I do?
-Don't waste another second.

22:02.070 --> 22:06.070
Hit accept. If I've learned anything,
it's to not wait.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.860
I'm right here
if you need a bruised finger.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.030
-Ow.
-Oh, God.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.910
No, not "oh, God." Oh, good.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.790
-Oh, no!
-Not "oh, no!" Oh, yes.

22:16.870 --> 22:20.500
Oh, stop. Sol, come here.
He sent me a message. I need your help.

22:20.580 --> 22:23.380
You've got a lot of
conflicting feelings about me.

22:25.670 --> 22:28.630
Oh. Oh, wait. I got something.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.470
No, that's just a signed headshot

22:33.560 --> 22:35.810
-of CCH Pounder.
-Oh, my God.

22:35.890 --> 22:39.310
Miss Pounder.
I thought I lost you.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.310
I'm a <i> Shield</i> fan.
Seriously, she was that show.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.400
Let's put that right there.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.990
So, you want to talk about it?

22:49.070 --> 22:50.820
You mean when I lost my shit?

22:50.910 --> 22:52.740
Look, I get it.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.120
You're the only normal one in the family.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.290
And we rely on you a lot.

22:58.370 --> 23:00.750
But you don't have to be that guy.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.300
I like being that guy.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.710
I like when people lean on me.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.800
It's just I'm running out of shoulders.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.890
Yeah, and you have more shoulders
than anyone I know.

23:16.180 --> 23:19.180
-I got it.
-Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

23:19.270 --> 23:21.770
-Nope, the letter. I got the letter.
-Oh. You got the letter. Yeah.

23:21.850 --> 23:24.020
And a pepperoni.

23:24.110 --> 23:27.070
Let's not eat that.
Uh-- Let's eat it.

23:30.240 --> 23:33.120
Here... let me do it.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.070
No.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.040
I want to.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.410
Really?

23:40.460 --> 23:41.920
I think I got, like...

23:42.920 --> 23:45.040
one more shoulder for you.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.880
Thanks, brother.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.640
Ready?

24:05.020 --> 24:06.230
She wants to meet you.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.450
So he "hello'd" me
and I "hello'd" him back.

24:17.530 --> 24:18.580
Now what?

24:18.660 --> 24:21.660
You send him a message saying...

24:21.750 --> 24:24.960
"I have a glass of wine
and I'm in my bathing suit."

24:26.340 --> 24:28.420
So the conversation would go,
"Hello," "Hello,"

24:28.500 --> 24:30.840
"I have a glass of wine,
I'm in my bathing suit"?

24:30.920 --> 24:33.880
Well, you didn't like
my rumination on loneliness.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.350
-Well, it was depressing.
-Well, what do you have?

24:36.430 --> 24:39.310
Well, I was thinking something like,
"How's it going, Phil?"

24:39.390 --> 24:41.310
-Snore.
-I have to write something.

24:41.390 --> 24:44.650
It's been four minutes.
I don't want to be rude.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.480
Write "How's it going?"
but drop the second "G."

24:46.560 --> 24:49.400
That way, it sounds sexy and casual.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.070
"How's it goin'?"

24:51.150 --> 24:52.530
"How's it goin'?"

24:53.450 --> 24:54.950
I think it needs the "G."

24:55.990 --> 24:58.200
I'm out of here, Grace.
You're doing fine on your own.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.370
And I've got to go be...
on my own.

25:02.450 --> 25:05.040
Oh, it's gonna get better, Sol.
This is just the worst part.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.540
Thanks.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.010
Now I have to wait for his response.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.970
-Don't panic.
-Oh!

25:16.050 --> 25:18.350
He's probably feeling
all the same things you are.

25:18.430 --> 25:23.390
Just sitting there
with his ex-wife's new...

25:23.480 --> 25:27.810
lesbian... new wife.
Maybe not.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.240
Oh, for God sakes. What do you want?

25:41.330 --> 25:44.410
-I have something to say to you.
-I really don't want to hear it.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.370
Too bad, it's coming out.

25:51.130 --> 25:52.380
What?

25:53.210 --> 25:54.970
I owe you something.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.510
And I had been planning
on owing it forever.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.300
Instead, I'm gonna say it to your face.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.600
I'm not in the mood for this.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.640
I'm sorry.

26:06.390 --> 26:09.100
I'm so sorry, Robert.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.400
I know better than anyone

26:12.480 --> 26:15.110
what being cheated on feels like and I...

26:15.990 --> 26:18.160
I regret doing it to you.

26:20.740 --> 26:24.700
I appreciate your apology,
but it doesn't change anything.

26:25.660 --> 26:27.500
It wasn't all Sol's fault.

26:27.580 --> 26:30.330
-You should be mad at me, too.
-Oh, I am.

26:30.420 --> 26:33.920
Good. Because that night
didn't just happen to happen.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.170
I wanted it to.

26:37.260 --> 26:41.350
I needed to know for sure
if there was any hope,

26:41.430 --> 26:45.470
if there was any--
anything left between Sol and me.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.850
And now I know.

26:52.020 --> 26:55.400
Well, I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.780
What do you want me to say?

26:56.860 --> 26:59.740
I'm not telling you this to hurt you. I...

26:59.820 --> 27:03.580
I'm telling you that... Sol is gay.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.950
And he loves you.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.250
In a way he'd never love me.

27:10.290 --> 27:14.130
In a way he never... did love me.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.260
And he loved me a lot.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.010
I guess that's it.

27:24.350 --> 27:27.680
That's what I came to say.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.650
Frankie.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.400
I'm sorry, too.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.990
And I should have said it a long time ago.

27:42.110 --> 27:44.990
I apologize for causing you pain.

27:45.080 --> 27:49.910
And for all those years sneaking around
and being disrespectful to you.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.920
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.840
Thank you.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.930
Hello, boyfriend. Can I call you that?

28:43.010 --> 28:44.550
I'm OK.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.800
That's nice of you to call and check in.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.100
I like a boyfriend who does that.
