WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.671
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:03.704 --> 00:06.006
It's just off 41.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.141
What's off 41?

00:07.175 --> 00:08.709
Father Marcus.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.178
That's quite a rosary.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.080
MARCUS:
It's a gift from a friend.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.914
CHERRY:
Vocare Pulvere.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.016
Ceremony of ash.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.219
(squeaky gasping)

00:21.389 --> 00:24.092
What are their names,
Father Bennett?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.726
MARCUS:
We need to find Bennett...

00:25.759 --> 00:26.827
fast.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.861
Jim.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.098
I'm going to make a call
to your boss,

00:30.131 --> 00:31.865
and I'm going to see
how he feels

00:31.899 --> 00:34.068
about the whole "priests
committing adultery" thing.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.170
The Devil in My Daughter.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.073
What happened to you
in Georgetown?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.109
SALESMAN: Do you know what's
my favorite memory of you?

00:41.142 --> 00:43.077
This.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.113
My Regan MacNeil.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.280
It's coming for me, Father.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.948
I know it.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.918
You little stinkpot.

00:50.951 --> 00:51.985
(crack)

00:56.290 --> 00:58.292
(lively chatter in distance)

01:08.169 --> 01:09.970
ANGELA:
I was in my room, and...

01:10.003 --> 01:12.306
I heard a thumping sound.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.942
I came out
and looked around a-and...

01:14.975 --> 01:17.245
saw her down at the bottom
of the stairs.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.481
At first, I didn't even know
what I was looking at.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.151
How would you describe your
relationship with your mother?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.952
I loved her.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.421
LAWRENCE:
Timeline--

01:27.455 --> 01:32.160
daughter goes missing
under mysterious circumstances.

01:32.193 --> 01:35.629
Daughter next emerges from
a nunnery, except this time

01:35.663 --> 01:38.432
she has amnesia and can't
tell you where she's been.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.769
Do you have any idea what my
sister has just been through?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.671
She was in a hospital
six miles away from here.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.806
Sweetie, no, it's okay.
The man is just doing his job.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.508
Thank you,
Mrs. Rance.

01:47.541 --> 01:52.413
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around all these... facts.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.282
Well, the fact is
that my family has been

01:54.315 --> 01:56.517
through two unthinkable
tragedies.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.321
Well, more, if you count
my husband and-and Kat.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.755
The accident she had.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.291
And-and we're
not looking

02:03.324 --> 02:04.825
for special consideration
at all.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.027
It's-it's just...
a little compassion

02:07.060 --> 02:08.962
goes a long way.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.131
Would you...
would you mind?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.037
CASEY:
Last rights, priest?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.207
Giving up on the piglet so soon?

02:19.240 --> 02:22.343
TOMAS/MARCUS/MOTHER BERNADETTE:
But most of all because
they offend Thee, my God,

02:22.376 --> 02:24.712
who are all good and deserving
of all my love.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.848
MARCUS:
Angela, get back!
Return to the shadow, viper!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.783
You have no hold on this woman!

02:29.817 --> 02:31.719
MOTHER BERNADETTE:
Child of God, you are forgiven.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.022
All...

02:35.055 --> 02:36.890
this prattling.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.527
They just won't stop.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.395
CASEY/SALESMAN:
Sorry,

02:41.429 --> 02:43.331
Mommy, show is over.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.800
Time to give the people
what they want.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.901
Casey...

02:47.935 --> 02:50.170
(crackling)

02:50.204 --> 02:51.972
Casey, no!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.474
(gasps)

02:53.507 --> 02:56.510
Take me instead.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.711
(soft gasp)

02:57.745 --> 02:59.680
(faint whooshing)

03:07.288 --> 03:08.822
Ah...

03:08.856 --> 03:10.558
together again.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.395
What do you say?

03:14.428 --> 03:17.197
Let's give 'em a good show.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.032
(sobbing):
Casey. No!

03:19.066 --> 03:20.368
No!

03:20.401 --> 03:23.103
(quietly):
No, Casey.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.139
*
(indistinct chatter)

03:28.742 --> 03:30.644
(panting)

03:42.456 --> 03:45.293
We've taken enough of your time.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.461
Respectfully, sir, I still
have some more questions.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.896
No, you don't,
Detective.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.298
We're done here.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.799
What the hell's going on?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.166
Outside, Detective Lawrence.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.474
I'll see what I can do about
getting those protestors

04:00.508 --> 04:02.142
and news vans off your lawn.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.612
That's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.280
We'll be in touch.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.750
(lively chatter continues
outside)

04:09.783 --> 04:11.151
(exhales)

04:11.184 --> 04:12.986
(door closes)

04:13.020 --> 04:15.323
Let's go pick up your sister.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.461
*

04:50.324 --> 04:52.726
*

05:14.415 --> 05:16.384
Your room's not
ready yet, Casey.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.752
We'll share mine,
until we move.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.858
(gate creaks)

05:27.027 --> 05:28.829
(low growling nearby)

05:28.862 --> 05:30.864
(dogs barking, snarling)

05:36.203 --> 05:38.205
(low growling)

05:45.613 --> 05:47.347
(camera shutter clicking)

05:51.685 --> 05:53.987
Any sign of Bennett?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.990
He checked out last night
and left with a French cardinal.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.427
Probably Guillot,
Archbishop of Lyon.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.261
Forget the frog cardinal.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.863
Follow the money.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.765
Maria Walters.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.500
She's the slush mama

06:06.534 --> 06:08.402
of the slush funds.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.737
She's bankrolling
all this.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.138
(mechanical whirring)

06:14.207 --> 06:15.609
I know this man.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.011
LESTER: It's Brother Simon.
Fundraising chair.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.414
When I knew him
he was a counselor

06:20.448 --> 06:23.050
at a renewal center
for deviant priests.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.285
Sounds like a hell
of a place to recruit.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.722
He was watching me.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.724
Bennett knew...

06:30.758 --> 06:32.826
about this Brother Simon.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.730
(exhales)

06:36.764 --> 06:39.366
If Bennett was taken,
we have to assume

06:39.399 --> 06:42.936
that he was tortured
for information.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.806
Which means
they know about us...

06:45.839 --> 06:48.609
Mother Bernadette...

06:48.642 --> 06:50.578
possibly Tomas.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.045
So what's the plan, boss?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.313
Hitch up the trailer,

06:53.346 --> 06:55.716
get out of town,
both of you, tonight.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.817
What about you?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.655
HENRY:
Hey there, honey.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.857
Casey, you look well.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.461
ANGELA:
All right.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.663
There we go.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.801
HENRY:
We tried inviting Father Marcus,

07:13.834 --> 07:15.636
didn't we, Ange?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.605
ANGELA: Okay,
everybody, dig in.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.106
Don't let it get cold.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.774
Honey, let's say grace.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.344
HENRY: Kat, you
want to lead?

07:24.377 --> 07:26.079
Please.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.280
Bless us, O Lord

07:27.314 --> 07:29.917
for these Thy gifts which
we are about to receive.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.285
Amen.
And thank You...

07:32.319 --> 07:34.688
for bringing Casey
back home to us.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.625
And... let us
remember Chris,

07:37.658 --> 07:41.128
who was sweet
and funny, and...

07:41.161 --> 07:43.997
even though we decided
to call her Chris,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.199
I really wish
I had called her Grandma.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.435
I think she
would have liked that.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.470
Amen.
OTHERS: Amen.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.307
So, you're really
gonna leave Chicago?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.809
Uh, you have a plan?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.477
I know these people in Canada,

07:57.511 --> 07:59.312
actually, and there's a
few builders out there.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.614
I could consult.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.550
Or we could just stay
in Chicago.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.852
Mom, we packed up half
the house; it was your idea.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.219
We'll talk about it later.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.955
HENRY:
What about you,
Father Tomas, uh,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.157
you gonna take a break?
No, no, no. This...

08:10.190 --> 08:13.026
ordeal has clarified
some things for me.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.795
Renewed my commitment.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.498
Uh, my parish needs me, and...
I've neglected it.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.334
I guess we've monopolized you
these past few weeks.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.236
Well, look who's a regular
chatterbox tonight.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.972
I would like

08:25.005 --> 08:26.640
to make a toast

08:26.674 --> 08:28.141
to my whole family.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.677
To Henry...

08:29.710 --> 08:31.044
to Kat...

08:31.078 --> 08:33.280
and my sweet, sweet Casey.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.284
And to Grandma,
who died...

08:39.219 --> 08:41.722
...on our staircase.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.428
To Chris.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.163
To Chris.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.164
To Chris.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.532
To Mom.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.173
Hey, Henry.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.575
Father.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.276
Hey, come on in, sit down.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.312
Thank you. (sighs)

09:06.313 --> 09:07.915
How do you feel, Henry?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.618
How's... how's everything?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.119
(sighs):
Well...

09:12.152 --> 09:15.756
sometimes whole days go by,
and, um...

09:15.789 --> 09:17.557
you start to feel like,

09:17.591 --> 09:20.694
hey... maybe
I'm finally getting better,

09:20.728 --> 09:23.597
maybe I'm a human being again,
and then...

09:23.631 --> 09:25.365
(pops)

09:25.398 --> 09:27.367
...right back to potato land,

09:27.400 --> 09:29.569
as my darling daughter
would say.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.973
HENRY:
Angie, wow!

09:33.006 --> 09:35.075
You... going somewhere?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.144
The hotel.
Like this one says:

09:37.177 --> 09:39.079
"You neglect your duties
too long,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.814
everything falls to pieces."

09:40.848 --> 09:44.084
Apparently, I'm indispensable.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.753
Okay, when you
gonna be back?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.354
(door closes)

09:48.656 --> 09:49.657
Okay.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.091
(both chuckle)

09:51.124 --> 09:54.161
You know,
I don't think you know this,

09:54.194 --> 09:57.197
but... everything started here.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.400
You gave me a message.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.003
You told me where to
find Father Marcus.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.673
I did what, now?
You told me

10:05.706 --> 10:08.709
how to get to a place called...
St. Aquinas.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.516
God... spoke through you, Henry.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.858
Father...

10:24.892 --> 10:26.894
does this mean
anything to you?

10:28.729 --> 10:31.631
Uh, the number 162?
Yeah.

10:31.665 --> 10:35.002
Okay, ever since I woke up
from the accident,

10:35.035 --> 10:38.171
I've had this, uh...

10:38.205 --> 10:40.974
low-frequency sound
in my head.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.209
Mm-hmm.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.277
It's like being in a restaurant,

10:44.311 --> 10:48.315
and... everyone is yammering
away in the background.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.217
Except sometimes,

10:50.250 --> 10:53.220
sometimes it feels
like there's a pattern.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.488
Like, all at once,

10:55.522 --> 10:59.159
all those people start saying
the exact same thing

10:59.192 --> 11:01.261
at the exact same time.

11:02.329 --> 11:06.233
Are they talking to you
right now?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.335
It started a few days ago,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.337
over and over.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.240
162, 162.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.608
And I have no idea
what it means.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.684
(camera shutter clicking)

11:29.222 --> 11:31.191
CHERRY: Whole band's
here tonight.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.560
Wonder what they're up to.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.534
(shutter clicks)

11:43.470 --> 11:45.438
Cherry.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.374
Yeah, babe.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.876
Let's get out of here.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.911
The parade pauses.

11:50.944 --> 11:55.082
The driver slows
to a stop here.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.018
And the pig pops out
of the pigmobile.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.552
These men are ready?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.254
Oh, they're quite ready.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.289
Who do you think

12:02.322 --> 12:06.393
signed off on their exile
to St. Aquinas?

12:06.426 --> 12:09.396
That denier of angels,
Pope Sebastian.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.898
ANGELA:
Where are the popes

12:10.931 --> 12:14.935
who take advantage
of the office?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.905
Urban VI.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.407
Now, there was a pontiff.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.309
He actually
complained

12:22.342 --> 12:24.778
that he couldn't hear
enough screaming

12:24.812 --> 12:26.780
from those
who plotted against him

12:26.814 --> 12:29.582
while they were being flayed.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.385
Glad you could make it.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.621
A recent arrival
to Chicago.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.156
Angela Rance?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.657
No.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.492
Pazuzu.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.933
We thought you had left us
after your little spat with...

12:45.966 --> 12:47.734
Father Merrin, was it?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.269
Am I missing something?

12:49.302 --> 12:53.106
A little bird told me
about your plans for Sebastian.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.843
With the greatest of respect,

12:55.876 --> 13:00.180
I've spent six years planning
this welcoming.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.950
The honor is mine
and mine alone.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.953
Well, see, if you
really understood respect,

13:05.986 --> 13:09.189
you'd already be
where you belong.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.492
(men groaning)

13:31.311 --> 13:33.446
(pants)

13:33.480 --> 13:35.482
Lower.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.721
Lower.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.457
(grunts)

13:44.491 --> 13:45.725
(chuckles softly)

13:45.758 --> 13:48.628
No, no, no.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.064
Not you.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.073
Do you want to know
why you've never been chosen?

14:00.107 --> 14:02.342
Yes.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.011
It's your smell.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.847
The Firstborn are attracted
to power and potential.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.848
And

14:08.882 --> 14:11.985
you...
(inhales)

14:12.019 --> 14:14.988
desperation with notes of...

14:15.022 --> 14:16.189
mediocrity.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.591
You're never gonna
be one of us.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.094
(groans)
(grunts)

14:21.128 --> 14:23.096
All right.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.864
We need to
send a message

14:24.898 --> 14:27.968
to everyone
who's ever stood against us.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.371
Starting with these

14:31.404 --> 14:33.406
sanctimonious whores.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.379
(birds chirping)

14:40.580 --> 14:43.216
Excited for tonight's gala?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.686
I'm more excited about
His Holiness' arrival tomorrow.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.922
These things
can be a bit much.

14:48.956 --> 14:52.960
But really more of an
opportunity for our benefactors

14:52.993 --> 14:56.596
and the Friars of Ascension
to pat themselves on the back.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.598
What do you think
about St. Bridget's?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.900
Beautiful, very beautiful.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.569
You should see the rectory.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.471
Even I don't live that well.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.040
(both chuckle)

15:07.074 --> 15:10.477
What would you say
if I told you it could be yours?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.114
FATHER DENNIS:
Yes, uh...

15:14.147 --> 15:16.616
Father Dennis
is retiring,

15:16.649 --> 15:19.052
not altogether
voluntarily, between you

15:19.086 --> 15:21.921
and me, but it's time.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.424
He gets to go out
on a high note,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.759
and we get to install
a top prospect

15:26.793 --> 15:28.761
in one of our
finest parishes.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.630
What about St. Anthony's?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.299
Sadly...
(clears throat)

15:32.332 --> 15:35.635
that was another thing that
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.570
We're closing St. Anthony's.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.671
What?

15:38.705 --> 15:41.108
It's been hemorrhaging
money for years now.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.809
The congregation
has shrunk.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.578
Father, we've been
growing recently. I...

15:45.612 --> 15:46.980
I can't abandon
my parish.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.482
Your parishioners
will be absorbed

15:49.516 --> 15:51.318
into nearby
congregations.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.952
It happens all the time.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.322
Tomas, St. Anthony's

15:55.355 --> 15:58.992
will be shuttered, whether you
accept this promotion or not.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.493
And, believe me, it is

16:00.527 --> 16:02.329
a promotion.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.997
You don't want me here.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.332
Of course we do.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.008
(quietly):
I have sinned.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.309
I don't deserve
a promotion.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.344
I deserve to--

16:17.377 --> 16:19.979
Her husband dropped by
my office.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.349
I know all about it.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.788
Then you know I can't.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.123
It's a problem.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.125
I'm not saying it's not.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.128
And you will do your penance.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.798
But this transfer has been
in the works for a while now.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.334
We can handle
the husband

16:41.368 --> 16:42.535
on our side.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.871
Believe me,
we've dealt with far worse.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.075
But you have to handle the girl
on yours.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.646
If you want this, that is.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.884
And you do want
this, Tomas.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.223
Father Dennis.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.857
Ah, Bishop Egan.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.526
How are you?
Very good.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.761
Please, come.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.063
(sighs)

17:22.475 --> 17:24.444
(door opens in other room)

17:24.477 --> 17:27.080
(paper crinkling)

17:31.451 --> 17:33.353
Picking locks again.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.522
Security's pretty lax
around here.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.390
You might want to put that
on your to do list.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.729
The diocese is closing down
St. Anthony's.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.765
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.103
What did they offer you?

17:51.938 --> 17:55.775
I've been asked
to run St. Bridget's.

17:57.477 --> 18:01.114
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

18:01.148 --> 18:05.084
And I bet it makes
your friend Maria Walters happy.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.956
She's been a great friend
to this church.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.464
Mind your back
about this new gig.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.799
You're playing
the premiership now.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.568
And the higher you rise,
the more there are

18:21.601 --> 18:23.069
to conspire your fall.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.238
(chuckles softly)

18:25.272 --> 18:28.107
Are you going to see
His Holiness tomorrow?

18:28.141 --> 18:32.111
I might be able to get you
a good spot at the parade route.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.984
(phone beeping, buzzing)

18:47.327 --> 18:50.297
I ain't much into parades.
(chuckles softly)

18:53.032 --> 18:55.502
I'm gonna miss this place.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.244
(dogs barking in distance)

19:08.348 --> 19:09.549
Remember this one?

19:09.582 --> 19:10.983
I wore it to your confirmation,

19:11.017 --> 19:13.019
and another girl
had the same exact dress on.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.354
This is way too
short for me now.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.555
You should
try it.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.923
Okay.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.295
Case,

19:22.329 --> 19:24.664
don't make me whip out
the tickle monster.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.674
So, we're all walking on
eggshells around you, yeah?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.810
They treated me the same
way after the accident.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.814
Everyone's too afraid to ask
you what you want for dinner,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.383
if you want to go to a movie.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.684
(quietly):
Kat, please.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.918
I just...

19:45.952 --> 19:48.521
I don't feel like talking.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.056
Right.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.359
Rather just scroll
through Twitter all night.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.665
Casey.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.235
They had names.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.237
Families.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.905
Kids.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.907
He did that,

20:07.940 --> 20:09.409
not you.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.744
It was my body.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.746
And my hands.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.084
He made me watch.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.922
He thought it was funny.

20:22.955 --> 20:26.092
But you survived.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.095
Yeah, great.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.763
Now what?

20:30.797 --> 20:33.300
I don't know.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.906
We're gonna figure it out.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.843
I thought I told you...

20:45.312 --> 20:48.315
(sighs)
Damn it.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.934
God

21:07.967 --> 21:11.137
our Father,

21:11.170 --> 21:14.474
Your power brings us to birth,

21:14.507 --> 21:17.644
and by Your command
we return to dust.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.647
Lord, those who
die still live

21:20.680 --> 21:23.282
in Your presence.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.251
Their lives change,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.986
but do not end.

21:27.019 --> 21:30.657
I pray in hope for my family,
relatives, and friends

21:30.690 --> 21:33.660
and for all the dead
known only to You.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.963
Unite us together again
in one family,

21:36.996 --> 21:41.568
so that we may sing Your praise
forever and ever.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.114
Knock-knock.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.183
There you are.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.852
The sisters sent me out
to the garden.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.521
I've been looking

22:01.554 --> 22:04.056
all over the place
for you.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.195
Vow of silence, right.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.464
I brought you something.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.966
It's a token
of gratitude.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.168
What do you get a
bunch of nuns, right?

22:16.202 --> 22:19.739
Well, it was either this
or warm, woolen mittens.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.544
No?

22:27.547 --> 22:31.551
I wanted to thank you
for saving my little girl.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.020
Although, I must say

22:34.053 --> 22:36.856
you did waiver a bit,
didn't you?

22:38.357 --> 22:41.160
We should've killed you
when we had the chance.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.195
She speaks.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.533
I felt you the moment you walked
through these doors.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.169
I don't know how we missed it
the first time.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.939
Well, you were distracted.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.207
I tried to let it go,

22:55.241 --> 22:57.577
but I just knew
that I wouldn't

22:57.610 --> 22:59.111
be able to live with myself

22:59.145 --> 23:01.414
knowing that you
were still out there.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.082
Not after what
you did to me.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.586
All the suffering for nothing.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.756
In the end, you're just
a child throwing a tantrum.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.758
"Tantrum"?

23:11.791 --> 23:14.026
This is not a tantrum.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.895
This is a victory lap.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.932
(gurgling)

23:22.234 --> 23:24.604
(choking)

23:24.637 --> 23:27.740
(gurgling)

23:27.774 --> 23:29.776
(choking, gasping)

23:34.647 --> 23:36.115
Mmm.
(bones cracking)

24:02.942 --> 24:06.212
(dog barking in distance)

24:27.967 --> 24:31.370
ANGELA: They had to clip it
with bolt cutters to get it off.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.708
(clears her throat)

24:38.377 --> 24:40.613
Mom?

24:40.647 --> 24:44.316
What do you, um...

24:45.351 --> 24:48.387
What do you remember about...?

24:51.157 --> 24:53.125
Well...

24:53.159 --> 24:56.062
I remember what
it felt like.

24:56.095 --> 24:59.799
What did it feel
like for you?

24:59.832 --> 25:04.070
Like nothing about me
was mine anymore.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.940
Mmm, because he was
inside you, right?

25:09.742 --> 25:13.479
It's as deep as
anyone can get.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.848
It's so intimate,

25:15.882 --> 25:17.684
isn't it?

25:17.717 --> 25:19.351
No. That's...

25:19.385 --> 25:21.654
That's not how it was for me.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.255
Well, no, uh, I know,

25:23.289 --> 25:24.657
you had to say no.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.426
I mean, that's the game, right?

25:27.459 --> 25:30.496
But, at a certain point,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.999
you asked for it.

25:33.032 --> 25:37.604
So much shame
for enjoying it.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.371
And the dirty little secret is

25:39.405 --> 25:42.174
you fell in love with him.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.243
Then when he left,

25:44.276 --> 25:48.380
the loneliest feeling
in the world.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.550
But we've both
been through it,

25:51.584 --> 25:56.222
and now we have
each other, right?

25:57.123 --> 25:59.225
Did we pack
my art books?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.027
I'm sorry.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.630
We were just having
a little heart-to-heart.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.032
You okay, Case?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.033
Mom?

26:07.066 --> 26:09.068
Hmm?
You're bleeding.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.770
Hmm?

26:10.803 --> 26:13.606
Oh, it's nothing.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.708
(sighs)

26:15.742 --> 26:18.377
I love this blouse.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.246
Thank you.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.519
Mother Bernadette!

26:37.630 --> 26:39.666
(gasping):
Oh, God.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.401
(choir singing)

26:42.434 --> 26:44.771
*

26:48.540 --> 26:50.710
(indistinct chatter)

27:02.121 --> 27:04.256
You, of course,
recognize this young man,

27:04.290 --> 27:06.693
Father Tomas
of St. Anthony's.
Hi.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.928
And soon, we hope,
of St. Bridget's.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.097
It was wonderful what you did
for that poor girl.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.032
God did everything;
It was...

27:13.065 --> 27:15.101
You see what I mean?
The humility.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
(indistinct conversations)

27:17.203 --> 27:18.671
We have to show you the offices

27:18.705 --> 27:20.439
and wait until you see
the rectory here.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.274
Ah. I've heard it's very nice.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.044
You keep this up, Father, you're
gonna put me out of a job.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.779
Well, I'm happy doing mine.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.415
The mayor has told me she'd love
to have you doing that here.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.152
Well, I'm actually
a White Sox fan.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.353
I know...

27:34.386 --> 27:36.789
(glass clinking)

27:36.823 --> 27:39.191
I want to thank you all
for coming.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.961
It's no secret that our city

27:41.994 --> 27:44.296
has seen its share
of hardships lately.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.633
Innocent lives lost,
communities ripped apart,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.235
threats against
the church itself.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.839
But I've always believed
that in the darkest hour,

27:52.872 --> 27:54.974
a light shines brightest.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.576
There is no brighter light

27:57.609 --> 28:00.479
than His Holiness,
Pope Sebastian.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.750
For those who have given up,
he is God's hope.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.919
For those who struggle to find
purpose in their lives,

28:06.953 --> 28:09.155
he is God's reason.

28:09.188 --> 28:13.760
For those who feel beyond
salvation, he is God's love.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.495
For many of us
in the room tonight,

28:16.528 --> 28:18.264
he is the Church.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.900
May his visit bring joy

28:20.933 --> 28:25.171
and inspiration to a city
who so badly needs it.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.006
Thank you.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.708
(applause)

28:34.646 --> 28:37.183
HENRY:
I hate to bring this up, but we
should probably make a decision

28:37.216 --> 28:40.319
about a funeral for your mom.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.291
When's the last time
you touched me?

28:49.261 --> 28:52.198
Uh...

28:52.231 --> 28:54.767
It's been a while.
I don't know.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.904
It's been a long while.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.875
Take your pants off.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.111
(laughing):
What? Right now?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.379
Mm-hmm.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.415
Just like that, huh?
Take 'em off.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.651
Oh. Wow.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.486
Okay.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.123
This is kind of
out of the blue.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.092
Mm-hmm.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.560
Hi, Angela.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.896
Hello, Henry.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.932
(both laughing)

29:32.504 --> 29:34.506
Hey, Ange.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.978
(voice strangled):
Ange, what are you doing?

29:39.011 --> 29:40.179
(laughing)

29:40.212 --> 29:41.814
Ange.
(moaning)

29:42.849 --> 29:45.184
(choking):
Ange...

29:49.221 --> 29:52.458
What are you doing?

29:52.491 --> 29:54.126
Honey,
are you all right?

29:59.565 --> 30:01.567
(indistinct chatter)

30:05.504 --> 30:06.705
(engine starting)

30:13.412 --> 30:15.414
(doors closing)

30:22.154 --> 30:24.356
MAN (on TV):
Just about to release your next
record at the end of the week.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.025
WOMAN:
I am.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.693
MAN: Well, now, you didn't stop
by here tonight just to talk,
(door opens nearby)

30:27.726 --> 30:29.561
or do you actually have
something to promote?
(footsteps nearby)

30:29.595 --> 30:31.697
WOMAN: Well, you know,
I've been writing this record

30:31.730 --> 30:33.565
and recording it
for about a year now,

30:33.599 --> 30:35.567
and, um, just been trying
to figure out what...

30:37.436 --> 30:39.438
(dog barking in distance)

30:49.015 --> 30:51.017
(hinges creak quietly)

31:02.461 --> 31:04.463
*

31:25.217 --> 31:27.219
(gasps softly)

31:29.788 --> 31:31.557
(clears throat loudly)

31:33.625 --> 31:35.027
(hinges creaking)
Hey, Mom.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.462
What are you
still doing up?

31:36.495 --> 31:37.896
Shh.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.532
(whispers):
I don't want to wake her.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.369
I'm just savoring
what I have.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.105
Yeah, well, um, couch is
too lumpy to sleep on,

31:46.138 --> 31:48.407
so savor us tomorrow?

31:52.844 --> 31:54.947
Night, Mom.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.628
No, it's not a no,
it's a condition.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.063
My staff comes with me.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.764
And also, I want a bus.

32:12.798 --> 32:15.467
Wednesdays and Sundays,
we'll run it back and forth

32:15.501 --> 32:17.136
from St. Anthony's
to St. Bridget's.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.441
I know, but the parish at
St. Bridget's can afford it.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.943
I think it's going to be a good
thing for them to share a pew

32:24.977 --> 32:28.180
with the people from
a different tax bracket.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.285
I'll take care of that tonight.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.321
Good night, Bishop Egan.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.323
("Devil's Trill Sonata" playing)

32:39.125 --> 32:41.093
(footsteps)

32:41.127 --> 32:43.129
(humming along to music)

32:53.205 --> 32:54.540
Mmm.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.977
(knocking on door)

33:02.381 --> 33:04.383
*

33:18.997 --> 33:21.433
(grunting)

33:24.070 --> 33:25.737
(coughs)

33:26.772 --> 33:28.607
Stay down.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.913
Some people would call that
a very rude hello.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.550
(grunts)

33:38.584 --> 33:39.685
(grunting)

33:45.191 --> 33:47.259
Oh, are we sharing a soak?

33:47.293 --> 33:49.161
God's creature, water on
the earth, I cast out the echo

33:49.195 --> 33:51.063
of evil by the living God,
by the one true God,

33:51.097 --> 33:52.564
by the holy God,
through whom

33:52.598 --> 33:54.266
all things have their being.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.503
Did you kill them?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.505
Bennett? The Regos?

33:59.538 --> 34:00.839
The nuns?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.741
In their final moments,

34:02.774 --> 34:05.711
do you think cattle
blame the slaughterhouse?

34:05.744 --> 34:09.581
Or do they blame the Judas goat
that led them up the ramp?

34:09.615 --> 34:13.252
I didn't kill anyone, priest.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.221
You did.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.291
I received
a promotion today.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.729
It's everything
I've ever dreamed about.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.032
That's...

34:27.065 --> 34:29.101
that's great.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.403
But the whole time the bishop
was offering it to me,

34:31.437 --> 34:34.140
all I could think was...

34:34.173 --> 34:36.742
I don't deserve this.

34:38.610 --> 34:42.448
And I'm tired.

34:42.481 --> 34:45.751
I'm tired of not being the man
God wants me to be.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.920
I'm tired of...

34:48.954 --> 34:52.158
being disappointed every single
time I look in the mirror.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.097
We could have done this,
you know.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.302
I would have made your coffee

35:03.335 --> 35:06.004
just right every morning.

35:06.037 --> 35:09.708
You would've bought me the
same perfume every Christmas.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.148
It could've been so normal.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.553
I can't give you
what you want, Jessica.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.358
The life that you deserve,
I can't.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.160
I seduced
a priest.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.264
Exactly what kind of life
do I deserve?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.866
A long...

35:34.900 --> 35:36.835
and happy life.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.543
Please don't
write to me anymore.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.316
It'll be easier that way.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.524
(grunting)

35:58.557 --> 36:00.192
(burbling, water hissing)

36:01.227 --> 36:02.828
Did you kill them?

36:02.861 --> 36:05.697
I'll accept responsibility

36:05.731 --> 36:08.033
for the academics
in the trailer.

36:08.066 --> 36:11.036
But who do you think
massacred

36:11.069 --> 36:14.906
Sister Bernadette and her
whores of mercy this afternoon?

36:14.940 --> 36:18.244
That was Angela Rance.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.949
(burbling, water hissing)

36:26.117 --> 36:28.387
Did you lose your nerve, Father?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.856
Ipse Venit, He is coming.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.224
You're gonna kill the pope.

36:32.258 --> 36:35.694
Oh, you were
such a mess at Aquinas.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.896
(splashing, burbling)

36:45.937 --> 36:47.072
The parade--

36:47.105 --> 36:48.740
is that where
you're gonna do it?

36:48.774 --> 36:52.711
The sun breaks
over our fair city.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.914
God's faithful
crowd every street corner.

36:55.947 --> 36:59.685
The car stops, the door opens.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.587
And the whole world watches

37:01.620 --> 37:04.089
while a disgraced priest

37:04.122 --> 37:06.558
murders the living embodiment

37:06.592 --> 37:08.560
of Catholic hope.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.562
Rome's shame

37:10.596 --> 37:12.531
come full circle.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.267
And what if I kill you now?

37:15.301 --> 37:17.202
Then another will take my place.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.071
And the ponies
go round and round.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.073
(door bangs open)

37:22.107 --> 37:24.776
(grunting)

37:24.810 --> 37:26.778
(blows landing,
Marcus grunting)

37:26.812 --> 37:28.714
Would one of you be so kind

37:28.747 --> 37:31.517
as to pass me a towel?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.586
(hinges creaking)

37:46.097 --> 37:47.333
(quietly):
Dad?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.136
Hey, hon.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.806
(footsteps approaching)

37:54.840 --> 37:56.842
KAT (whispers):
You ready?

37:56.875 --> 37:57.909
Girls, what is this?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.311
We have to go.
Now.

37:59.345 --> 38:00.312
Without Mom?

38:00.346 --> 38:01.913
She's not Mom.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.315
I don't know
how it happened,

38:03.349 --> 38:05.451
but he left me
and went to her.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.986
I recognize him.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.688
I believe her, Dad.

38:09.721 --> 38:10.989
After everything
that's happened,

38:11.022 --> 38:12.358
I don't need any more proof.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.362
We have to leave this house now.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.199
Okay. Okay.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.640
Time for a family meeting.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.346
(dog barking in distance)

38:39.351 --> 38:41.720
I want to talk to Mom.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.455
You are talking to her.

38:43.489 --> 38:47.225
My mom doesn't have
three pupils.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.562
(gasps)

38:52.364 --> 38:54.265
Angie.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.504
You can
fight this.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.140
Casey got through it,
so can you.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.011
I'm not possessed, Henry.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.346
This is integration.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.016
She invited me in.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.184
Don't you understand?

39:13.218 --> 39:16.354
This is permanent.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.290
Why do you keep hurting us?
What do you even want?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.027
The only thing that we've

39:22.060 --> 39:25.931
ever wanted:
that which is rightfully ours.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.199
We were His

39:28.233 --> 39:29.501
first creations.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.503
Did you know that?

39:31.537 --> 39:33.705
We were loyal and perfect

39:33.739 --> 39:36.174
in every way.
And do you know what God did?

39:36.207 --> 39:38.209
God got bored.

39:38.243 --> 39:40.546
He got bored with
our perfection.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.549
So He created Man,

39:43.582 --> 39:47.052
mortal and ugly, and... and then

39:47.085 --> 39:50.055
He built them
a sandbox,

39:50.088 --> 39:52.223
and He filled it
with tangible

39:52.257 --> 39:54.960
and sensual delights.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.029
Delights that
we could never feel

39:58.063 --> 40:01.567
or taste or experience.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.901
He created paradise,

40:02.934 --> 40:04.402
and he
handed it over

40:04.436 --> 40:06.772
to a pack of primates
rutting in the dirt.

40:08.273 --> 40:11.477
Well, this world
was meant for us.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.345
And we're gonna take it back.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.249
Tara.

40:18.283 --> 40:21.052
Sorry, I got sucked in.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.420
Have you read this?

40:22.454 --> 40:24.556
She led such a life.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.324
Where did you get that?

40:26.357 --> 40:29.995
Oh. When Chris was here,
helping find Casey...

40:30.028 --> 40:31.930
I kind of asked her
for her autograph

40:31.963 --> 40:33.765
and she gave me
her own personal copy.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.767
No. No, the feather--

40:35.801 --> 40:37.603
where did you get that?

40:37.636 --> 40:39.638
In the book.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.543
Um, can I...

40:50.716 --> 40:53.084
162.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.353
"I knew then that the demon
would never rest,

40:55.386 --> 40:56.955
"never stop,

40:56.988 --> 40:59.457
"until it had taken Regan
for its own.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.860
"It would keep coming for her

41:01.893 --> 41:03.895
until the end of time."

41:12.303 --> 41:15.607
Did you know, we approached
His Holiness years ago,

41:15.641 --> 41:17.943
back when he was
still just a lowly

41:17.976 --> 41:19.811
Apostolic nuncio.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.813
We offered him a peek
behind the curtain,

41:21.847 --> 41:25.316
a chance to ascend
this mortal slog.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.052
And do you know
what he did?

41:27.085 --> 41:29.320
He turned his back on eternity,

41:29.354 --> 41:31.857
like a child.

41:34.359 --> 41:38.263
I wonder if you'll
make the same mistake.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.538
Vocare Pulvere.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.210
Tomorrow,
when we wake up,

41:52.243 --> 41:53.444
we can put all this behind us.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.514
Bundle up. Go downtown.

41:56.548 --> 41:57.783
We can wave at the pope.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.887
A little family outing.
Won't that be fun?

42:03.354 --> 42:06.191
But first... you have to learn

42:06.224 --> 42:08.760
that disobedience
has consequences.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.932
Which means that I'm gonna
have to hurt one of you.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.767
Just a little.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.202
Just so you remember.

42:20.806 --> 42:22.608
Did you kill Grandma?

42:24.409 --> 42:26.111
Oh, my God.

42:26.144 --> 42:29.414
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.050
That disrespectful
tone of voice.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.254
(gasps)

42:36.287 --> 42:38.056
(chokes)

42:38.089 --> 42:40.225
No!
Angela, stop! Let her go!

42:40.258 --> 42:42.393
Stop, please!

42:43.595 --> 42:46.397
Stop!
I need to hear it.

42:46.431 --> 42:48.566
I need to hear you say
you'll behave.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.902
We'll behave, I promise!
(gasping)

42:50.936 --> 42:52.370
Just please let her go!

42:52.403 --> 42:54.305
I don't believe you.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.573
HENRY:
Angela, stop it!

42:55.607 --> 42:56.875
(gasping)

42:56.908 --> 42:58.409
Angela!
Please!

42:58.443 --> 43:00.278
Angela, please,
we swore to you.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.648
Stop!
Stop it. Angie!

43:02.681 --> 43:04.315
You're killing her!

43:04.349 --> 43:05.751
Please, stop. Stop.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.352
(door bangs open)

43:09.454 --> 43:11.990
Get the hell away from them.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.361
