- From the moment we met...
<i>- We knew our lives</i>

00:03.864 --> 00:06.265
<i>would never be the same.</i>
He saved my life.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.032
<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:08.035 --> 00:10.135
We're destined...

00:10.137 --> 00:12.004
<i>But we know it</i>
<i>won't be easy.</i>

00:12.006 --> 00:14.673
Even though we have every
<i>reason to stay apart...</i>

00:14.675 --> 00:17.209
<i>We'll risk it all</i>
<i>to be together.</i>

00:17.211 --> 00:19.778
I am so in
love with you.

00:23.183 --> 00:25.451
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast:

00:25.453 --> 00:26.753
Who are they?

00:26.755 --> 00:28.321
Garnett and Newell.

00:28.323 --> 00:30.223
They're here to help catch
the vigilante.

00:30.225 --> 00:32.292
Okay, so Joe's hired assassins.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.726
I got in contact
with some people

00:33.728 --> 00:36.496
who will destroy this
thing once and for all.

00:36.498 --> 00:37.630
Muirfield?

00:37.632 --> 00:39.632
What if the only way
for all of us

00:39.634 --> 00:41.668
to be free
is to give them what they want?

00:41.670 --> 00:44.437
And what's that?
Me.

00:44.439 --> 00:46.506
I have a possible location
for our killer.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.642
So much for the plan,
we got to get out of here.

00:55.483 --> 00:57.517
How many times did I tell you,

00:57.519 --> 00:59.519
I needed him
brought to me

00:59.521 --> 01:01.321
before the rest
of the team got to him?

01:09.564 --> 01:11.764
No, no!

01:11.766 --> 01:13.232
No.

01:16.103 --> 01:17.670
Okay, it's okay.

01:17.672 --> 01:19.906
It's okay,
you're gonna be okay.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.281
He was about to attack me,
cuff him.

01:28.283 --> 01:30.750
Tess, Tess, you need to
put your gun down.

01:30.752 --> 01:32.051
He needs help.

01:32.053 --> 01:33.386
What is happening?

01:33.388 --> 01:34.654
He's changing.

01:34.656 --> 01:36.522
Okay, call an ambulance.

01:36.524 --> 01:38.391
No ambulance.

01:38.393 --> 01:40.326
Get my bag.

01:40.328 --> 01:41.761
Cat, stand back! Stop moving.
It's okay, I know him

01:41.763 --> 01:44.497
and he's not
going to hurt us, all right?

01:44.499 --> 01:46.165
Vincent, what do you need?
Vincent?

01:46.167 --> 01:47.433
The knife in the front pocket.

01:47.435 --> 01:49.235
Is that Vincent Zalanski
that you've been dating?

01:49.237 --> 01:50.329
That's the serial killer
we've been looking for?

01:50.330 --> 01:50.891
What do you need?

01:50.916 --> 01:52.539
You are not giving
him a knife right now!

01:52.540 --> 01:54.974
What do you need it for?
I'm gonna dig the bullet out.

01:54.976 --> 01:57.310
What?
Just give it here, give it to me.

01:57.312 --> 01:59.312
Catherine,
put the weapon down, now!

01:59.314 --> 02:02.582
Tess, he just needs to get
the bullet out.

02:02.584 --> 02:04.283
You're acting
as an accessory.

02:04.285 --> 02:06.619
Stand up, walk backwards
with your hands in the air.

02:06.621 --> 02:08.755
Do what she says.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.356
No, Tess, he is not a serial
killer, please.

02:10.358 --> 02:13.092
Precinct 125,
it's Vargas, I need backup.

02:13.094 --> 02:16.095
Do you copy, do you copy?
Please don't do this!

02:20.534 --> 02:24.170
Tess! Tess!

02:24.172 --> 02:25.538
Go get her.
She will tell everyone!

02:25.540 --> 02:28.141
Go! I'll be fine. Go!

02:28.143 --> 02:29.275
Go now!

02:34.314 --> 02:36.349
Tess, he's not a killer!

02:36.351 --> 02:38.151
Tess, wait!

02:44.525 --> 02:46.726
Tess, wait.

02:48.162 --> 02:49.429
Tess!

02:51.365 --> 02:53.433
Help!

02:54.702 --> 02:56.169
I'm sorry, please!

02:56.171 --> 02:57.236
Please, come on,
come on.

02:57.238 --> 02:58.371
Just wait, just wait.
Help!

02:58.373 --> 02:59.378
Help!
You got to listen to us, okay?

02:59.403 --> 03:00.609
Tess.
Get off.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.383
Tess, it's okay,
he's not gonna hurt you.

03:02.410 --> 03:03.743
How did you get here?

03:03.745 --> 03:05.178
I heal quickly, okay?

03:05.180 --> 03:06.646
He was an...
Help!

03:06.648 --> 03:08.181
Hey! Hey!
Help!

03:09.317 --> 03:11.417
Oh, my God, Vincent.

03:11.419 --> 03:12.485
Vincent, just...

03:12.487 --> 03:13.719
He...
There was an experiment.

03:13.721 --> 03:15.121
Vincent, he was a soldier,

03:15.123 --> 03:16.422
they changed his DNA,

03:16.424 --> 03:17.557
they turned him into this,

03:17.559 --> 03:18.524
and now they're
trying to kill him.

03:18.526 --> 03:19.659
Good!

03:19.661 --> 03:21.060
No one can know...

03:21.062 --> 03:22.795
What did you do?

03:22.797 --> 03:24.397
I didn't do anything.

03:24.399 --> 03:26.666
Hey.
JT?

03:26.668 --> 03:28.301
What, I didn't kill
her, it's a tranq gun.

03:28.303 --> 03:29.535
You tranqued her?

03:29.537 --> 03:32.338
He bought us
some time, okay?

03:37.511 --> 03:38.945
What do we do now?

03:53.804 --> 03:55.083
We're already
out of a home.

03:55.084 --> 03:57.436
I say we run,
head to Canada now.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.636
Just leave her here?
She's fine.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.104
She's not fine.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.067
You gave her the
same dosage you give Vincent.

04:02.068 --> 04:03.700
She's half his size.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.670
Okay, her vitals are
normal, she's okay.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.238
Can we not
worry about her

04:08.240 --> 04:10.540
and maybe worry about us?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.943
They're going to be
looking for her.

04:12.945 --> 04:15.545
No recent calls
and she hasn't texted anyone

04:15.547 --> 04:18.014
where she was headed
so we have a little time.

04:18.016 --> 04:19.583
And when she doesn't check back
with work?

04:19.584 --> 04:20.517
I'll send an e-mail
from her phone.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.084
And then what?

04:22.087 --> 04:23.920
We can't keep her here
indefinitely.

04:23.922 --> 04:25.522
We leave now,

04:25.524 --> 04:27.524
we get a head start
before she exposes us.

04:27.526 --> 04:31.628
Your precinct, the FBI, oh, and
Muirfield are all after us.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.430
JT, slow down, okay?

04:33.432 --> 04:35.098
No one is leaving yet.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.600
Catherine has
her whole life here,

04:36.602 --> 04:38.335
not to mention
her family.

04:38.337 --> 04:39.970
She stays here,
she goes to jail,

04:39.972 --> 04:41.104
how's that help her family?

04:41.106 --> 04:42.239
Maybe Tess needs

04:42.241 --> 04:44.408
a-a little time
to adjust to the shock

04:44.410 --> 04:45.976
of seeing me
like that, all right?

04:45.978 --> 04:48.311
You mean after the five years
of psychotherapy

04:48.313 --> 04:50.847
she's gonna need for
that simple adjustment?

04:50.849 --> 04:51.948
Okay, not to mention,
she's a cop.

04:51.950 --> 04:53.016
She sees things black and white.

04:53.018 --> 04:54.451
It's her job to find the person

04:54.453 --> 04:56.086
who killed her
boyfriend's brother, that's it.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.254
Catherine,
she's not just a cop,

04:57.256 --> 04:58.989
okay, she is your partner.

04:58.991 --> 05:00.924
Ex-partner.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.159
After spending four years in a
squad car with you,

05:02.161 --> 05:03.260
she cares about you, okay?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.562
And even though
this situation

05:05.564 --> 05:09.499
is a little gray,
a partner is a partner.

05:09.501 --> 05:11.234
Okay, before we put all
our faith in this

05:11.236 --> 05:13.336
charcoal partnership,

05:13.338 --> 05:16.223
I should probably mention that
her other BFF, Evan,

05:16.224 --> 05:17.958
is now on Muirfield's payroll.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.589
What?

05:18.614 --> 05:19.761
You really know
how to pick them.

05:19.762 --> 05:21.962
Okay, look,
a problem for another day.

05:21.964 --> 05:23.097
Look, given our options,

05:23.099 --> 05:24.598
I think you need to at least

05:24.600 --> 05:26.033
try and
convince her that

05:26.035 --> 05:27.868
she needs to protect us
in some way.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.969
In the meantime,

05:28.971 --> 05:30.971
we need to get
my DNA samples

05:30.973 --> 05:32.973
to the morgue so Muirfield's
new recruit

05:32.975 --> 05:35.142
can confirm
that one of the bodies

05:35.144 --> 05:37.678
in the warehouse, was,
in fact, me.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.781
I'm not leaving Tess.

05:40.783 --> 05:42.049
Fine, I'll do it.

05:44.152 --> 05:48.389
You're going to need this.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.761
What if I can't convince her?

05:53.763 --> 05:56.764
Then we run.

05:56.766 --> 05:58.999
<i>Anyone seen Vargas?</i>

05:59.001 --> 06:00.167
Not since yesterday.

06:00.169 --> 06:01.568
Guess she never got the memo we
caught the guy.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.203
It means she's
doing her damn job.

06:04.139 --> 06:06.073
What about Chandler?

06:06.075 --> 06:07.641
No, I haven't
seen her either.

06:07.643 --> 06:09.109
She's probably
celebrating the takedown.

06:09.111 --> 06:11.045
Yeah, congratulations, boss.

06:11.047 --> 06:12.413
Thanks, but why don't we wait

06:12.415 --> 06:14.348
for the DNA
results and the body.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.016
I'm surprised to hear you say
that, Joe.

06:16.018 --> 06:18.519
Considering I heard you just
called a press conference.

06:18.521 --> 06:20.054
Easy, Lowan.

06:20.056 --> 06:21.422
I'm not going to go in there
and say,

06:21.424 --> 06:23.424
"Got you suckers."

06:23.426 --> 06:25.492
But I got the AP, the <i>Post</i> and
the <i>Times</i> hounding me.

06:25.494 --> 06:26.693
Okay, I'm just trying to control
the rumor mill.

06:26.695 --> 06:28.062
How?

06:28.064 --> 06:29.630
All we know is
Detective Chandler

06:29.632 --> 06:31.698
talked to some
mystery CI at Rikers,

06:31.700 --> 06:33.534
who gave her the address of an
abandoned building.

06:33.536 --> 06:35.669
Which somebody exploded
the minute they found out

06:35.671 --> 06:37.004
we were descending.

06:37.006 --> 06:39.973
Seems like the actions
of a wanted man to me.

06:39.975 --> 06:41.809
Actually, it all
seems vague and convenient.

06:41.811 --> 06:43.811
What's going on, Gabe?

06:43.813 --> 06:45.579
This because we
didn't bring him in alive?

06:45.581 --> 06:46.847
I'm not sure we got him at all.

06:46.849 --> 06:47.915
But if we did, yeah.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.450
See, I'm the ADA.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.485
I prefer to put a
living human being on the stand.

06:51.487 --> 06:55.022
Well, you know I prefer to ask
a living human being

06:55.024 --> 06:56.957
why he killed my baby brother.

06:56.959 --> 07:01.428
See, in this job, I put
my personal agenda aside.

07:01.430 --> 07:02.763
But I get it,

07:02.765 --> 07:06.633
you want to be a tough
guy, save the city.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.936
Better than being the guy
with egg on his face

07:08.938 --> 07:11.038
because he implied
something and was wrong.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.308
Good luck
with that press conference.

07:19.447 --> 07:21.115
<i>I don't even know where</i>
<i>I should start.</i>

07:21.117 --> 07:23.784
Muirfield
or the vigilante stuff?

07:25.053 --> 07:28.622
Okay, maybe you should
start with you and Tess.

07:28.624 --> 07:30.057
There is no me and Tess.

07:30.059 --> 07:31.792
She saw me tampering
with evidence.

07:31.794 --> 07:33.760
She doesn't
believe a word I say.

07:33.762 --> 07:36.563
She's probably burnt
every picture of us,

07:36.565 --> 07:37.598
every birthday card.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.832
Okay, yes, you lied.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.135
And chased and drugged her.

07:41.137 --> 07:42.903
You didn't have a choice.

07:42.905 --> 07:44.905
Okay, I know you feel guilty
about the lying,

07:44.907 --> 07:46.607
but in all honesty,

07:46.609 --> 07:49.143
it wasn't your secret to tell
in the first place.

07:49.145 --> 07:52.846
I st-- I still lied.

07:52.848 --> 07:56.416
Even though I had
good reasons, it...

07:58.720 --> 08:00.988
I didn't have a gun to my head.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.323
I made a choice to lie to her

08:03.325 --> 08:06.026
and she is never going to
forgive me for that.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.630
Okay, our best shot at
convincing her

08:09.632 --> 08:11.098
is to appeal to her as a cop.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.767
Tess has this
amazing sense of justice.

08:13.769 --> 08:15.102
If I can show
her that every crime

08:15.104 --> 08:17.404
that you've
been involved in,

08:17.406 --> 08:19.573
it's been because you've been
trying to save someone, then...

08:19.575 --> 08:21.675
Catherine,
I've killed people, too.

08:21.677 --> 08:24.678
Okay, you said she's
black and white.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.914
But it has never been
with the intent to kill.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.750
It's always been with the intent
to protect.

08:29.752 --> 08:32.885
And sometimes, you have to use
the force necessary.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.721
That's not going to be
gray to her.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.123
That's what we do as cops.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.758
She's going to get that.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.193
What-what-what are you doing?

08:39.195 --> 08:40.494
Wh-where are you going?

08:40.496 --> 08:42.029
I've got to go build a case.

08:42.030 --> 08:44.063
She's not going to believe me,
so I have to get proof.

08:44.066 --> 08:48.001
And, I've got to e-mail work
and say that she's-- I'm--

08:48.003 --> 08:49.970
not feeling 100%.

08:56.811 --> 08:58.845
I came as soon
as I heard you got him.

08:58.847 --> 09:00.614
How did you...

09:00.616 --> 09:01.815
Word travels.

09:01.817 --> 09:04.084
You know,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.519
It was on Instagram?

09:05.521 --> 09:06.620
Kids today...

09:06.622 --> 09:08.655
Ah, I just figured...

09:08.657 --> 09:11.825
you know,
we were once partners in this.

09:11.827 --> 09:12.826
Uh, thought I'd come by
to see what this

09:12.828 --> 09:14.795
gnarly bastard looks like.
Oh!

09:14.797 --> 09:16.897
They all look pretty much
the same: burnt.

09:16.899 --> 09:19.499
So, great, uh, what can I do?

09:19.501 --> 09:22.803
You want me to man
the centrifuge?

09:22.805 --> 09:25.138
No, I've got the centrifuge
under control.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.207
Okay.

09:28.977 --> 09:30.944
Wait, uh,
before you turn it on

09:30.946 --> 09:32.913
I think we should pray.

09:32.915 --> 09:34.081
Or-or bet.
More fun.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.482
Come on.

09:35.484 --> 09:36.783
Let's see what
these suckers look like.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.952
I've got people
waiting for the results.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.487
Let them wait.

09:40.489 --> 09:41.855
For once, us
scientists have the power.

09:41.857 --> 09:43.156
Savor it.

09:43.158 --> 09:44.858
Let's see which body
is our creature,

09:44.860 --> 09:46.693
one, two, three or four?

09:46.695 --> 09:48.095
Just don't touch
the test tubes.

09:48.097 --> 09:49.529
Evan, hey.

09:49.531 --> 09:50.664
Hey.

09:50.666 --> 09:52.933
Uh, Detective Chandler.

09:52.935 --> 09:54.635
Professor Forbes.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.170
I'm, uh,
Dr. Marks' colleague.

09:57.172 --> 09:59.640
I'm just
so excited it's here.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.841
So, we got our guy?

10:00.843 --> 10:02.609
Uh, we're not sure yet.

10:02.611 --> 10:04.177
I've had
some interruptions.

10:04.179 --> 10:06.613
But, he wouldn't let
me near the test tubes.

10:06.615 --> 10:08.849
You don't have
to worry about him,

10:08.851 --> 10:11.752
he's a real rule follower.
That's not what I hear.

10:11.754 --> 10:12.853
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:12.855 --> 10:15.122
Sure.

10:15.124 --> 10:18.659
Don't touch anything.

10:20.962 --> 10:23.163
So, I know that you're
keeping a file on everything

10:23.165 --> 10:26.633
related to that and I was
wondering if I could take it?

10:26.635 --> 10:28.068
Just for the day?

10:28.070 --> 10:29.469
Cat, I'm not
planning to go ahead

10:29.471 --> 10:30.470
with any of the
cross-species aspect...

10:30.472 --> 10:33.073
No, no, neither am I.

10:33.075 --> 10:34.541
All everyone needs to know

10:34.543 --> 10:36.576
is whether the DNA matches
the previous cases.

10:36.578 --> 10:38.578
Yeah, I just want
to refresh my memory

10:38.580 --> 10:40.047
on all the details
of the crimes

10:40.049 --> 10:41.114
so I can write my report.

10:41.116 --> 10:43.450
Unless, there's
some other reason

10:43.452 --> 10:45.118
that you want
to hold onto it.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.787
Nope.

10:46.789 --> 10:48.155
Um, just, I need it back.

10:48.157 --> 10:49.890
Just for my
private research.

10:49.892 --> 10:50.957
Okay.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.259
<i>Chandler.</i>

10:52.261 --> 10:54.528
Joe, hey, yeah, just in a rush.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.562
Where the hell you been?

10:55.564 --> 10:56.563
Uh, working on the case.

10:56.565 --> 10:58.198
Ah, then you'll be prepped.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.766
For what?

10:59.768 --> 11:01.468
You know, this really
isn't the best time.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.403
Tell them that.

11:03.405 --> 11:05.005
Is the city safe?
Detective Chandler?

11:05.030 --> 11:06.052
Detective Chandler?

11:06.053 --> 11:08.387
Can you confirm that
you caught the vigilante?

11:08.388 --> 11:10.356
Do you have more detail
on the killing?

11:10.358 --> 11:12.258
- Detective Chandler?
- Lieutenant?

11:12.260 --> 11:13.726
Is it true that there were
multiple victims at the scene?

11:13.728 --> 11:16.328
Can you tell us anything else
about the killer?

11:22.609 --> 11:24.342
Here's some water.

11:24.344 --> 11:25.810
It's okay.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.378
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

11:27.380 --> 11:29.147
I just... I just want to talk.

11:30.516 --> 11:31.549
Well, we took your gun.

11:31.551 --> 11:33.551
Just... just
for now, okay?

11:33.553 --> 11:34.919
Just so no
one gets hurt.

11:34.921 --> 11:37.355
Cat. Where's Catherine?
She's gone

11:37.357 --> 11:39.257
to the precinct, all right,
but she is on her way back,

11:39.259 --> 11:40.658
and she will explain...

11:40.660 --> 11:43.060
Look, I told work
exactly where I was going.

11:43.062 --> 11:44.595
They'll find me.

11:44.597 --> 11:46.964
Do you remember Catherine

11:46.966 --> 11:49.634
trying to tell you about,
um, some experiments?

11:49.636 --> 11:51.836
Oh, yeah, well, while you were
assaulting me, I do.

11:51.838 --> 11:54.372
You can add that
to your rap sheet, by the way.

11:54.374 --> 11:56.440
You know, what she
didn't get to tell you

11:56.442 --> 11:57.808
is that...

11:59.512 --> 12:03.548
...the organization that made me
the way that you saw,

12:03.550 --> 12:07.151
um, know they screwed up.

12:07.153 --> 12:09.554
They killed my entire unit
just to cover this up,

12:09.556 --> 12:13.257
and they will do the same to me,
or anyone who knows about me.

12:13.259 --> 12:15.393
Okay, that's the reason
why she didn't tell you.

12:15.395 --> 12:16.794
Or maybe she didn't tell me

12:16.796 --> 12:18.496
'cause she was harboring
a serial killer.

12:18.498 --> 12:20.865
I'm not a serial...
What?

12:20.867 --> 12:22.833
You're just a killer
of a series of people?

12:22.835 --> 12:26.304
I had to let my whole family,
anyone who's ever known me,

12:26.306 --> 12:28.039
believe I'm dead,

12:28.041 --> 12:29.574
killed in battle

12:29.576 --> 12:31.209
in Afghanistan.

12:31.211 --> 12:34.946
All right, not telling you
was for your own safety.

12:34.948 --> 12:36.581
That is all.

12:36.583 --> 12:40.618
We found prints of a dead guy,

12:40.620 --> 12:43.421
a dead vet,
on an old crime scene.

12:43.423 --> 12:45.623
Murdered fashion editor.
That was you.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.425
I did some CPR on her.

12:47.427 --> 12:48.726
That was almost a year ago.

12:48.728 --> 12:50.962
She's been lying
to me since then?

12:50.964 --> 12:53.531
And it has been killing her,
okay? Believe me.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.200
She is only doing this to...

12:56.202 --> 12:58.502
What, protect me?
I got that. Thanks.

12:58.504 --> 13:01.539
And with friends like that,
who needs serial killers?

13:01.541 --> 13:03.374
Though, apparently,
she likes to date them.

13:03.376 --> 13:06.510
Maybe we should just wait
until Catherine gets back.

13:12.818 --> 13:15.086
I'll take that as a yes.

13:15.088 --> 13:18.356
<i>For Detective Chandler--</i>
<i>your big tip from Rikers--</i>

13:18.358 --> 13:20.391
did he tell you anything
about this killer?

13:20.393 --> 13:21.926
As I said before,
I'm not able

13:21.928 --> 13:23.728
to disclose any
details at this time.

13:23.730 --> 13:26.030
What about the informant?
Any information on that?

13:26.032 --> 13:28.232
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:28.234 --> 13:29.900
we've told you
everything we know.

13:29.902 --> 13:31.636
And although we
remain optimistic

13:31.638 --> 13:34.038
we've caught our guy, the
NYPD urges you to remain

13:34.040 --> 13:35.306
cautious and vigilant.

13:35.308 --> 13:36.407
We will update you

13:36.409 --> 13:37.441
with any new developments.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.576
Thank you very much.

13:39.812 --> 13:41.379
Detective Chandler?

13:41.381 --> 13:42.947
You were appropriately
vague up there.

13:42.949 --> 13:44.448
But off the record,

13:44.450 --> 13:46.550
uh, the questions
that reporter was asking--

13:46.552 --> 13:47.885
can you answer any of them?

13:47.887 --> 13:49.787
Some, but I
really need to go.

13:49.789 --> 13:51.555
Which ones?

13:51.557 --> 13:54.592
The ones that got us into the
warehouse and broke the case.

13:54.594 --> 13:55.993
You could have
been a lawyer.

13:55.995 --> 13:57.928
So you think
we got the right guy?

13:57.930 --> 13:59.397
Yes.
Right.

13:59.399 --> 14:00.865
It was your tip.
You're biased.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.266
What about Vargas?

14:02.268 --> 14:05.670
What about Vargas?
What's she think?

14:05.672 --> 14:08.406
I don't know. She's, uh... she's
not my partner anymore, so...

14:08.408 --> 14:10.508
So you're not worried about her?
Why would I be worried?

14:10.510 --> 14:12.176
Forensics
aren't in yet.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.545
There could still be
the killer out there,

14:14.547 --> 14:16.914
and far as we know, she was
following up on a lead.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.582
She e-mailed Joe. She said
she wasn't feeling well.

14:18.584 --> 14:20.351
Oh.
Yeah.

14:20.353 --> 14:21.852
Yeah. She's so sick,
she can't answer my phone calls.

14:21.854 --> 14:23.521
You know, I
think I'll send

14:23.523 --> 14:25.923
Garnett and Newell by her place,
just to make sure.

14:25.925 --> 14:27.792
Okay, you know what? I will go.

14:27.794 --> 14:29.527
Since you are worried, I'll go.

14:29.529 --> 14:31.329
Thought you had
someplace you had to be?

14:31.331 --> 14:33.397
You know, she was my partner,
and I've got a key.

14:33.399 --> 14:35.232
I'll come with.

14:35.234 --> 14:37.335
Uh, you don't...
you don't need to do that.

14:37.337 --> 14:39.503
I'm sure you have plenty
of things that...

14:39.505 --> 14:41.505
Oh, I do, but
nothing more important

14:41.507 --> 14:44.241
than making sure one of our
detectives is accounted for.

14:44.243 --> 14:45.576
You drive.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.846
Okay.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.421
Maybe she ditched us both.

14:57.423 --> 14:58.856
No, no.
She is coming.

14:58.858 --> 15:01.859
Look, I had faith in her, too.
Look where I ended up.

15:01.861 --> 15:04.862
So, what do you think she gets
out of this relationship?

15:04.864 --> 15:07.865
'Cause I mean,
it's not the great digs,

15:07.867 --> 15:09.633
and it's not career advancement.

15:09.635 --> 15:12.203
She's facing jail time.
So what am I missing?

15:12.205 --> 15:13.471
I don't know.

15:13.473 --> 15:17.375
You know, I tried
pushing her away.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.710
Oh. The hard-to-get thing?

15:19.712 --> 15:22.947
Yeah, it's appealing at first,
but you get past it.

15:22.949 --> 15:24.849
So what?

15:24.851 --> 15:27.685
You know, maybe
I'm not all that bad.

15:27.687 --> 15:31.222
Okay, look, maybe we
should use this time

15:31.224 --> 15:33.557
to get to know
each other.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.694
You know, you and I--
we actually...

15:36.696 --> 15:38.763
we have a lot in common.

15:39.698 --> 15:41.365
No, we do.

15:41.367 --> 15:43.200
Um, I'm-I'm from a family
of firefighters,

15:43.202 --> 15:45.669
and Catherine told me that
you're from a long line of cops.

15:45.671 --> 15:47.671
And you got a
lot of brothers.

15:47.673 --> 15:51.909
Yeah, uh... I-I, um, I had two.

15:51.911 --> 15:53.377
They, uh...

15:53.379 --> 15:55.246
they, uh...
they died in the Towers.

15:55.248 --> 15:56.814
You're playing
the sympathy card?

15:56.816 --> 16:00.251
No, I'm just playing the cards
I was dealt.

16:00.253 --> 16:03.154
You know, the other thing
that we got in common?

16:05.490 --> 16:08.626
We both care
about Catherine deeply.

16:08.628 --> 16:11.462
Look, I know
you're furious

16:11.464 --> 16:15.132
at her right now,
but look, here you are--

16:15.134 --> 16:18.135
yes, held against your will--
but, you know,

16:18.137 --> 16:20.171
you're still trying
to understand her,

16:20.173 --> 16:23.507
and understand the choice
she made in being with me.

16:23.509 --> 16:25.776
And I'm still at a loss.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.912
I know, um...

16:27.914 --> 16:31.916
but maybe
you could just try and...

16:31.918 --> 16:34.552
hear her out when, uh...

16:34.554 --> 16:36.720
when she explains this

16:36.722 --> 16:39.990
to you.

16:39.992 --> 16:42.793
You're hungry, huh?

16:42.795 --> 16:44.261
What?

16:44.263 --> 16:45.729
I can hear your stomach.

16:45.731 --> 16:47.932
I just... I can tell.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.901
Yeah, I guess I am.

16:50.903 --> 16:54.472
We, uh, got some granola
bars. You want one?

16:56.374 --> 16:59.844
Yeah, I'm pretty thirsty, too.

17:17.295 --> 17:20.865
Oh, God!
Listen, listen!

17:20.867 --> 17:22.366
It's okay.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.801
All right, we...
we could have run.

17:24.804 --> 17:26.604
We could have
been long gone.

17:26.606 --> 17:29.139
But Catherine refused
to leave you behind.

17:29.141 --> 17:30.708
I swear, you're going
to have to kill me

17:30.710 --> 17:32.776
before I let you keep me
trapped down here any longer!

17:32.778 --> 17:34.645
Look, you turn her in,

17:34.647 --> 17:37.448
you will completely destroy her.

17:37.450 --> 17:41.719
All right, her career,
her entire life.

17:41.721 --> 17:45.556
Listen, I am not asking you
to protect me,

17:45.558 --> 17:49.760
so before you do anything,
you need

17:49.762 --> 17:51.428
to talk to her.

17:51.651 --> 17:56.512
Tess, you're not just a cop,
okay?

17:56.513 --> 17:57.846
You are her friend.

17:58.306 --> 17:59.672
So please,

17:59.674 --> 18:03.075
find her and talk to her.

18:04.787 --> 18:07.154
Okay.

18:07.156 --> 18:11.058
I'm letting you go now.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.957
How long has it been?
It'll ding when it's ready.

18:36.176 --> 18:39.077
That was a buzz,
not a ding.

18:40.279 --> 18:42.781
Is that a...?

18:42.783 --> 18:44.616
No.
But speaking of,

18:44.618 --> 18:45.817
they're gonna be pretty angry

18:45.819 --> 18:47.452
if one of those bodies isn't...

18:47.454 --> 18:49.254
it, aren't they?
It's not who I'm worried about.

18:49.256 --> 18:50.877
It's not? So, then...?

18:50.902 --> 18:52.124
Remember that woman
I told you about?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.426
Oh, yeah, uh... Katie...?

18:54.428 --> 18:56.261
Catherine,
who walked in here before.

18:56.263 --> 18:58.296
That's who just texted me
for the result.

18:58.298 --> 19:01.499
She's actually the one that
broke the case, remember?

19:02.468 --> 19:04.402
Wait.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.605
You have a thing for her.
What?

19:06.607 --> 19:08.607
I mean, I knew you joined
the evil arches for her,

19:08.609 --> 19:11.099
but I didn't realize
it was because...

19:11.258 --> 19:13.258
Because she was in danger.

19:13.260 --> 19:15.727
Oh, dude, you should
<i>so</i> not go there.

19:15.729 --> 19:17.162
You work together.

19:17.164 --> 19:19.097
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

19:19.099 --> 19:21.199
Since when have you been
concerned about my love life?

19:21.201 --> 19:24.503
I'm not, I'm... concerned
about your <i>life</i> life.

19:25.773 --> 19:29.474
You know, now that
you're in the grips of..."M."

19:29.476 --> 19:33.679
But just curious-- what happens
if she doesn't reciprocate?

19:33.681 --> 19:34.846
There's nothing <i>to</i> reciprocate.

19:34.848 --> 19:36.348
It's just,

19:36.350 --> 19:37.616
you've done all this for her.

19:37.618 --> 19:38.917
I don't want you going
all postal.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.017
Oh, my God.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.598
There's no trace of her.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.235
What are you doing
with Tess' phone?

20:05.237 --> 20:06.503
Oh, I found it here.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.624
You've been doing this
long enough to know

20:07.692 --> 20:08.924
you find
a missing person's cell...

20:08.926 --> 20:10.960
She's not a missing person.

20:10.962 --> 20:13.896
You think foul play, you tell
your partner you have a lead.

20:13.898 --> 20:16.499
Oh, I didn't realize
you were my partner.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.601
I'm not,
but I am starting to think

20:18.603 --> 20:20.402
that you're hiding something.

20:20.404 --> 20:22.771
I'm starting to think
the same thing.

20:22.773 --> 20:25.541
An ADA going on a ride-along?

20:25.543 --> 20:27.343
That's uniform cop stuff.

20:27.345 --> 20:29.545
Why are you so focused
on Vargas?

20:29.547 --> 20:30.980
What's your agenda?

20:30.982 --> 20:34.517
I have a personal investment
in this particular case.

20:34.519 --> 20:37.820
Care to elaborate?
No.

20:37.822 --> 20:41.590
That's even vaguer than my
answers at the press conference.

20:41.592 --> 20:44.693
Thing is, my situation
with Tess-- it's personal, too,

20:44.695 --> 20:47.897
and it certainly doesn't
require the attention of an ADA.

20:47.899 --> 20:51.367
It's between me
and my best friend.

20:51.369 --> 20:53.102
Best friend? Really?

20:53.104 --> 20:55.804
I thought you said that
you weren't partners anymore.

20:55.806 --> 20:58.674
I was wrong.

21:00.578 --> 21:04.547
And apparently, so were you.

21:05.615 --> 21:07.983
Forensics are back.
We got our guy.

21:07.985 --> 21:09.518
There's no longer
a killer out there.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.853
Really?

21:10.855 --> 21:12.521
You seem disappointed.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.256
I am.

21:14.258 --> 21:16.392
I wanted to meet him
face-to-face.

21:16.394 --> 21:19.929
But, hey, at least we know
he hasn't hurt your best friend.

21:19.931 --> 21:22.598
I'll call a car service.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.700
I'll let you know
when I find her.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.612
Oh, my God.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.450
Tess.

21:41.452 --> 21:42.685
What are you doing here?

21:42.687 --> 21:44.887
I, um...
Were you in my apartment?

21:44.889 --> 21:48.390
Long story. I went to get some
files from the morgue, and...

21:48.392 --> 21:49.792
Oh, yeah, right.
Your monster boyfriend told me

21:49.794 --> 21:51.427
you're going to explain
everything away.

21:51.429 --> 21:53.562
Okay, obviously, I...
How you lied to me for a year,

21:53.564 --> 21:55.831
drugged me, held me hostage.

21:55.833 --> 21:58.002
I am sorry
that I left you down there.

21:58.027 --> 21:58.826
And for what?

21:58.827 --> 22:01.928
So you could hide out
with your sociopathic boyfriend?

22:01.930 --> 22:03.330
He is not a sociopath.

22:03.332 --> 22:04.364
Okay.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.199
Okay, look, I
am not proud

22:06.201 --> 22:10.937
of what I have done...
but these files, they are all

22:10.939 --> 22:12.772
cases that Vincent's
been involved in.

22:12.774 --> 22:14.107
I don't want to look
at cases...

22:14.109 --> 22:16.042
Tess, it goes all the way
back to my mother.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.378
He was there

22:18.380 --> 22:20.714
that night in the woods.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.015
That...

22:22.017 --> 22:26.019
beast I thought I saw then,
that was him.

22:27.622 --> 22:29.923
And that case we had
with the dead guy's prints...

22:29.925 --> 22:31.725
That one I figured out.

22:31.727 --> 22:33.226
He tried to save her.

22:33.228 --> 22:36.363
Just like he saved me and Evan.

22:36.365 --> 22:38.164
Every time he's been involved,

22:38.166 --> 22:41.434
it's been because he is trying
to do the right thing.

22:42.436 --> 22:44.437
Except he killed Joe's brother.

22:44.439 --> 22:46.406
Who was about to shoot Heather.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.975
Darius's prints
were on the gun.

22:48.977 --> 22:52.712
You know what?
You can prove that in court.

22:52.714 --> 22:54.347
You can't be judge and jury

22:54.349 --> 22:56.750
while Vincent goes out
and plays executioner.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.351
They are hunting him, Tess.

22:58.353 --> 23:00.920
That doesn't put you
above the law.

23:00.922 --> 23:05.191
I knew that you would see it
that way, and I get it.

23:05.193 --> 23:07.861
That's part of why
I never told you.

23:07.863 --> 23:09.329
Because...

23:09.331 --> 23:11.865
you are black and white,
and this...

23:11.867 --> 23:13.433
So this is <i>my</i> fault?
No.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.269
No.

23:16.271 --> 23:19.172
This is my fault.

23:19.174 --> 23:20.774
Especially

23:20.776 --> 23:22.676
leaving you alone
in those tunnels.

23:22.678 --> 23:23.878
That's what you're focused on?

23:23.879 --> 23:25.712
After seeing those
pictures of us

23:25.714 --> 23:29.049
in your apartment... yeah.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.018
Everything else,
it just seems like

23:32.020 --> 23:33.953
this impossible
situation,

23:33.955 --> 23:37.891
and I don't know what I would
have done differently, but...

23:37.893 --> 23:40.193
leaving my...

23:40.195 --> 23:42.362
leaving my best friend

23:42.364 --> 23:45.165
to wake up, scared

23:45.167 --> 23:46.966
and alone

23:46.968 --> 23:49.602
in a tunnel?

23:50.938 --> 23:53.206
I am so sorry.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.277
And after doing that, I...

23:57.279 --> 24:01.181
I can't believe that I have
to ask you to be my friend

24:01.183 --> 24:04.784
and... trust me that

24:04.786 --> 24:09.689
the person that I have
fallen in love with, he...

24:09.691 --> 24:11.791
he isn't a monster.

24:11.793 --> 24:14.060
He isn't.

24:14.062 --> 24:16.129
The world is
a better,

24:16.131 --> 24:20.033
safer place with him in it.

24:24.473 --> 24:27.006
Maybe for you.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.311
And I might have
pictures up, but...

24:31.313 --> 24:34.514
I can't be your friend,
not after what's happened.

24:36.217 --> 24:39.219
You <i>have</i> to turn Vincent in.

24:39.221 --> 24:40.787
Tess...
Look...

24:40.789 --> 24:43.089
your boyfriend asked me
not to ruin your life,

24:43.091 --> 24:45.024
and I won't.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.193
I'll cover for you.

24:47.195 --> 24:50.029
But only if you turn him in.

24:55.736 --> 24:58.004
Okay, I won't lie
to you anymore.

25:00.674 --> 25:03.443
I can't do that.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.882
Wow.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.421
I am so sorry.

25:15.423 --> 25:17.624
Yeah.

25:19.927 --> 25:21.561
Your phone.

25:45.219 --> 25:49.455
Hey, yeah, it's Vargas
calling for Joe.

25:52.693 --> 25:55.261
Well, I need Garnett and Newell
to come meet me.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.197
We caught the wrong guy.

26:21.252 --> 26:23.387
She was at the morgue
two and half hours ago,

26:23.389 --> 26:24.988
so where is she?
I don't know.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.490
She's probably still
talking to Tess, okay?

26:26.492 --> 26:29.126
She was supposed to talk
to her down here, with you.

26:29.128 --> 26:31.194
Okay, we've got to go.
Tess is turning us in.

26:31.196 --> 26:33.430
Wha...? Well,
did she talk to you?

26:33.432 --> 26:36.400
Great. D-Didn't she come and see you?
I knew it.

26:36.402 --> 26:38.135
Kind of.
It's not important right now.

26:38.137 --> 26:39.302
Did you show her
the files on me?

26:39.304 --> 26:40.971
You were right--
cop angle didn't work,

26:40.973 --> 26:42.339
but neither did
the friendship one.

26:42.341 --> 26:43.240
There's a shocker.

26:43.242 --> 26:44.775
Can't believe you

26:44.777 --> 26:46.410
let her go because you
didn't bother to show up!

26:46.412 --> 26:48.078
He doesn't know how
to make small talk.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.013
JT, it's not the time to point
fingers right now, okay?

26:50.015 --> 26:51.515
You're the only one
they're not looking for.

26:51.517 --> 26:53.817
Go get the car and meet us
at the northeast entrance.

26:53.819 --> 26:55.352
We'll meet you there.

26:55.354 --> 26:57.054
We finally convince
them you're dead,

26:57.056 --> 26:59.656
and now you two
screw it up.

27:05.763 --> 27:07.831
You afraid of the dark?

27:07.833 --> 27:09.833
You want me to
hold your hand?

27:09.835 --> 27:12.269
I'm more afraid of how
trigger-happy you two are.

27:12.271 --> 27:13.804
Listen, Chandler could be

27:13.806 --> 27:15.138
down here looking for this guy,

27:15.140 --> 27:17.708
so don't just shoot
at anything that moves.

27:17.710 --> 27:21.478
Vargas, for once try not
to be such a damn Girl Scout.

27:25.149 --> 27:27.851
Guys!

27:27.853 --> 27:30.053
Whoo!
What did I just say?

27:30.055 --> 27:32.489
Hope the rat doesn't
file a complaint.

27:32.491 --> 27:34.157
Yeah.

27:34.159 --> 27:35.859
What is that?

27:35.861 --> 27:37.794
Oh, you see something
that you like, Vargas?

27:37.796 --> 27:39.062
Never seen a
cattle prod before?

27:39.064 --> 27:40.864
No, I'm just surprised you
brought one down here.

27:40.866 --> 27:43.500
You told us the guy was dangerous;
we came prepared.

27:43.502 --> 27:47.304
Yeah, but I didn't say he
was some kind of animal.

27:48.172 --> 27:51.141
What? What do you guys know?

27:51.143 --> 27:53.466
Why don't you just leave
this to us, all right?

27:53.491 --> 27:54.496
No way.

27:54.749 --> 27:56.315
Not if Chandler's down here.

27:56.317 --> 27:58.918
Look, there's a little more
going on here than you know.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.152
What does that mean?

28:00.154 --> 28:01.554
Who are you guys?

28:01.556 --> 28:03.722
No one. Hang... back.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.858
I'm not hanging anywhere.

28:05.860 --> 28:08.460
You're not following
NYPD protocol.

28:29.182 --> 28:31.951
What the hell was that?
You're the one that shot her!

28:31.953 --> 28:33.467
Yeah, after you
started messing with her.

28:33.492 --> 28:34.254
Look, she's dead,

28:34.255 --> 28:36.655
so she's not reporting us.
Lowan knows we're down here--

28:36.657 --> 28:38.791
they find her body,
he'll cover for us.

28:49.036 --> 28:51.337
<i>What exactly</i>

28:51.339 --> 28:52.671
did Tess say?

28:52.673 --> 28:54.173
She said she's
turning us in.

28:54.175 --> 28:56.108
What, even you?
Yes.

28:58.011 --> 28:59.578
You're lying.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.547
Fine, Tess said
she'd cover for me

29:01.549 --> 29:03.649
<i>if</i> I turned you in, which...

29:03.651 --> 29:06.018
which I am obviously
not gonna do, so...

29:06.020 --> 29:07.820
They're after me, not you.

29:07.822 --> 29:11.056
Head back to Tess and tell her
that you will turn me in.

29:11.058 --> 29:12.558
What? No.
By that time

29:12.560 --> 29:13.926
I will be long gone.

29:13.928 --> 29:16.495
Catherine, she's
giving you a choice.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.865
Okay, she's willing
to protect you still.

29:18.866 --> 29:21.592
This way you will get your
friendship and your career back.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.156
You are not leaving me.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.930
I am the reason why we're
in this stupid situation.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.733
So am I.
If it wasn't for me, you and...

29:28.735 --> 29:31.302
you and JT would be
in the Yukon Territories

29:31.304 --> 29:33.304
by now. Vincent,

29:33.306 --> 29:35.406
this whole time you've
been saying that...

29:35.408 --> 29:37.308
partners need to be there

29:37.310 --> 29:38.343
for each other.

29:38.345 --> 29:40.445
You, you are my partner.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.612
Come on.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.548
I've already lost
one today,

29:43.550 --> 29:46.617
I will not
lose another.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.523
Someone's coming.
Come on.

30:07.773 --> 30:11.242
Help! Help!

30:12.644 --> 30:14.512
They're cops.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.718
Okay, I'm gonna draw them
out, and you sneak past, okay?

30:19.743 --> 30:20.519
Okay.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.587
There he is! There he is!

30:22.589 --> 30:25.590
Hey, we need him alive.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.201
Hey!

30:38.537 --> 30:39.704
Help!

31:32.592 --> 31:34.158
Can anyone hear me?!

31:38.430 --> 31:40.665
You okay?

31:46.839 --> 31:48.606
You?
