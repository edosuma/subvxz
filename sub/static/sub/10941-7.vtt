over at the Hudson racetrack

00:08.308 --> 00:10.309

00:10.377 --> 00:11.777

Hey!

00:53.884 --> 00:55.518
<i>You're new, right?
What's your name?</i>

00:55.586 --> 00:57.653
Uh, Ty.
Ty Borden.

00:57.721 --> 00:59.021
Ty. The new guy.

01:00.257 --> 01:02.925
I think you deserve
a real Hudson Track welcome,

reprobates,

01:08.865 --> 01:10.632
I'd like to welcome you.

01:10.699 --> 01:12.267
Oh!

01:12.335 --> 01:13.435
Nice reflexes!

01:14.637 --> 01:16.438
Sorry, man.
It's just...

01:16.506 --> 01:18.240
It's part of the initiation.

01:18.307 --> 01:19.674
No hard feelings?

01:21.010 --> 01:22.544
Yeah. Sure.

01:22.612 --> 01:23.612
Okay.

01:24.747 --> 01:25.880
See y'around!

01:30.852 --> 01:32.319
Stella Jablonski?

01:32.387 --> 01:34.087
Hey, I went to school
with this person!

01:34.156 --> 01:35.623
How can Stella Jablonski

01:35.690 --> 01:37.158
be the featured entrepreneur
of the month?

01:37.225 --> 01:38.992
Do you have any of
Mrs. Bell's jam?

01:39.060 --> 01:40.093
<i>"This 20 something dynamo...</i>

01:40.162 --> 01:41.195
Lou?!

01:41.263 --> 01:42.728
"...is the CEO
of Green Bundle,

01:42.796 --> 01:45.965
"the latest niche-market darling
to start small and local

01:46.033 --> 01:47.400
"and turn big
and successful."

01:47.468 --> 01:49.335
I just opened a new jar,
like, yesterday.

01:49.403 --> 01:50.470
This, from someone who had

01:50.538 --> 01:51.704
a lower grade point average than me,

01:55.709 --> 01:58.510
Is that a Lexus
she's driving?

01:58.578 --> 02:00.745
Well, maybe you should've
cheated off her tests.

02:03.816 --> 02:06.885
Jealousy is a terrible
thing, Lou.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.626
What's his name?

02:15.694 --> 02:17.395
Lightning Dexter.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.199
Got great bloodlines
and a lot of early wins,

02:21.266 --> 02:22.333
but then all of a sudden,

02:22.401 --> 02:24.034
he just started refusing
at the gate.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.936
Hmm... that's weird.

02:26.004 --> 02:28.972
I sent him to gate-school,
he was perfectly fine.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.040
I hope we get lucky
today.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.774
He's a nice lookin' horse.

02:31.842 --> 02:32.975
Easy, easy.

02:34.478 --> 02:36.213
Look out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:36.280 --> 02:37.714
Oh!

02:37.781 --> 02:38.715
Liam, you okay?

02:38.782 --> 02:40.917
<i>Hey, you all right?</i>

02:40.984 --> 02:43.019
Fine. I'm fine.

02:43.087 --> 02:45.755
Sorry, Lisa.
Can't pass him.

02:45.823 --> 02:46.788
I know.

02:48.491 --> 02:51.260
Ty, thank you,
you can take him in.

02:51.328 --> 02:52.294
No problem.

02:53.363 --> 02:55.997
I give up.
We've tried everything.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.435
Unless you'd like
to take him on.

02:59.502 --> 03:01.537
Lisa, I'm so overbooked
right now, I...

03:01.605 --> 03:02.970
Please?

03:03.038 --> 03:04.972
I've spent so much time
and money on this horse.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.708
Maybe if you just took...
I really wish I could.

03:06.775 --> 03:08.610
But Lou's got
this schedule going,

03:08.677 --> 03:10.311
and she'd kill me.

03:10.379 --> 03:11.713
All right.

03:11.780 --> 03:12.813
I'm gonna have
to sell him

03:12.881 --> 03:14.915
as a well-bred
pleasure horse.

03:14.983 --> 03:17.418
Makes me crazy
to do it!

03:17.486 --> 03:18.452
- I'm sorry, I am.
- No, it's okay, honey.

03:18.519 --> 03:19.586
don't worry about it.

03:19.654 --> 03:21.521
I'll see you
in a little bit.

03:28.796 --> 03:30.397
There you go.
Thanks.

03:36.836 --> 03:37.770
Hi there!

03:37.837 --> 03:39.104
Hi. Sorry.

03:40.540 --> 03:42.408
I'm, I'm lookin'
for the Bartlett family.

03:42.476 --> 03:43.576
I'm Lou Fleming,

03:43.644 --> 03:45.578
I'm Jack Bartlett's
granddaughter.

03:47.113 --> 03:49.749
Does Ty Borden
still work here?

03:53.386 --> 03:55.987
Oh, great. A new horse
has been dropped off.

03:56.054 --> 03:58.290
Hey,
we're back.

03:58.357 --> 03:59.457
I know, I know.

03:59.525 --> 04:00.992
New arrival.
I'm on it.

04:01.059 --> 04:01.993
<i>Uh, yeah, it's not that.</i>

04:02.060 --> 04:03.060

<i>So how long has it been
since he's even heard from her?</i>

05:04.319 --> 05:05.585
Well,
I don't know,

05:05.653 --> 05:06.753
we've never really
talked about it,

05:06.821 --> 05:08.322
but...

05:08.389 --> 05:12.591
It's got to have been
a while... like years.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.727
How could a mother possibly
let years go by

05:14.794 --> 05:15.928
without a word
to her child?

05:15.996 --> 05:18.464
It's...

05:18.531 --> 05:19.498
You should've seen her
sitting there

05:19.566 --> 05:20.499
waiting for him.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.434
She was so nervous,

05:22.502 --> 05:24.303
<i>she was shaking.</i>

05:25.973 --> 05:28.706
I kinda felt sorry for her.

05:28.774 --> 05:31.809
Oh hey, uh, this new horse,
kabuki, arrived.

05:31.878 --> 05:33.144
Can't be saddled.

05:36.349 --> 05:37.849
<i>Look at this place!</i>

05:37.917 --> 05:40.818
<i>It looks like a picture
in a calendar!</i>

05:40.887 --> 05:42.453
How did you find me?

05:42.521 --> 05:43.587
Your dad.

05:43.654 --> 05:46.590
He phoned me,
totally out of the blue.

05:46.657 --> 05:48.592
Heh. Typical Brad.

05:49.594 --> 05:51.896
He said he spent some time
with you out here.

05:53.331 --> 05:55.565
Oh yeah, he spent
some time all right!

05:55.633 --> 05:58.068
Blew in with a truckload
of sick horses,

05:58.136 --> 05:59.402
and then drove off
with a couple thousand dollars

05:59.469 --> 06:01.404
of my friends' money.

06:01.471 --> 06:05.775
Oh, they must be thrilled
to see me on their doorstep.

06:05.842 --> 06:07.443
First, your no good father
rips them off,

06:07.511 --> 06:09.345
and now your neglectful
mother shows up.

06:09.413 --> 06:11.314
Why are you here?

06:12.383 --> 06:15.183
To see you,

06:15.251 --> 06:16.318
and to let you know that

06:16.386 --> 06:17.852
I spent the last few months
in Toronto

06:17.921 --> 06:18.853
with my friend, susie.

06:18.922 --> 06:21.223
You remember Susie?

06:22.725 --> 06:25.360
Anyway, I got some help.

06:25.428 --> 06:29.197
Real, professional help,
and it was amazing.

06:29.265 --> 06:32.866
It was good for me,
it was really good.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.635
I left him, Ty.

06:37.472 --> 06:38.639
I left your step-father.

06:38.706 --> 06:39.941
Don't call him that.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.310
Wade was no kind
of father to me.

06:42.411 --> 06:43.411
Okay.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.280
I get it.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.984
Anyway, I'm going to Vancouver
in a week.

06:51.052 --> 06:52.819
I got a new job.

06:53.887 --> 06:56.389
I'm ready now,
I can handle it.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.791
And Hudson,
was on my way West,

06:58.859 --> 07:00.193
so, I thought...

07:03.129 --> 07:04.896
I wanted to spend
a few days,

07:05.898 --> 07:07.666
maybe hang out a bit.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.234
I don't know,
I, uh...

07:09.302 --> 07:12.938
I work three jobs,
so, I'm kinda busy.

07:17.510 --> 07:18.677
Uh, but I...

07:18.744 --> 07:20.578
I mean, I guess
I could find some...

07:20.645 --> 07:21.946
Some spare time.

07:24.716 --> 07:26.484
What?

07:26.585 --> 07:28.286
You.

07:28.354 --> 07:30.688
I can't stop
looking at you.

07:30.755 --> 07:33.591
Boy, you turned out
real good.

07:39.263 --> 07:41.965
So, I've got you
all fixed up here.

07:42.033 --> 07:44.567
Why don't you give
this fancy new bridle of yours

07:44.635 --> 07:45.969
some attention?

07:46.037 --> 07:46.970
Don't you wanna know

07:47.038 --> 07:49.006
what they're saying
to each other?

07:49.073 --> 07:50.540
No. No, I don't,

07:50.608 --> 07:52.108
and neither do you.

07:52.175 --> 07:55.111
Fine, act like
you don't care.

07:57.814 --> 07:59.581
Seems to me that you've been...

07:59.649 --> 08:02.485
On a bit of a spending frenzy
these days.

08:02.552 --> 08:05.021
IPods...
And fancy new tack.

08:05.088 --> 08:06.122
Must be mighty draining

08:06.189 --> 08:07.655
on that bank account
of yours.

08:07.723 --> 08:09.524
I don't have a bank account.

08:10.559 --> 08:11.826
I don't see the point!

08:11.894 --> 08:13.895
I mean, I get the cash,
and then I spend the cash.

08:13.962 --> 08:15.696
You ever heard
of a rainy day?

08:15.764 --> 08:17.698
I could see why you'd like
to have something set aside

08:17.766 --> 08:19.267
for your sunset years,
Jack,

08:19.335 --> 08:21.903
but I've got eons
of earning power ahead of me.

08:21.970 --> 08:22.970
Thanks.

08:24.906 --> 08:26.640
They're coming.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.946
See? You do care.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.222
<i>My God,
you are a genuine cowgirl!</i>

08:43.323 --> 08:44.323
Thanks.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.325
Does he bite?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.528
Not unless provoked.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.497
Do you mind if I say hi
to the other horses?

08:52.565 --> 08:53.498
Go for it.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.703
What's going on?

08:58.771 --> 08:59.771
What do you mean?

08:59.838 --> 09:01.139
Why is she here?

09:02.241 --> 09:03.308
To visit.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.509
Did you know
she was coming?

09:05.577 --> 09:07.144
Well,
I don't know, Ty,

09:07.212 --> 09:08.179
sometimes you don't
tell me things.

09:08.246 --> 09:09.246
No, I didn't.

09:10.648 --> 09:13.250
She just left her husband,
Wade.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.886
Wade. The guy...
The guy you almost...?

09:15.954 --> 09:17.988
Well, uh...

09:18.056 --> 09:19.390
She could've done that
before you ended up...

09:19.458 --> 09:22.092
Amy.

09:22.159 --> 09:24.327
She was messed up
at the time, okay?

09:24.395 --> 09:26.028
Ty, that's no excuse.

09:26.097 --> 09:27.530
What am I supposed to do?
Tell her to get lost?

09:27.598 --> 09:28.565
Uh...

09:36.940 --> 09:38.006
I can't.

09:40.276 --> 09:42.211
We could be a great team, Mrs.
Bell.

09:42.278 --> 09:44.846
You've got the product,
I've got the marketing skills.

09:44.914 --> 09:46.181
I mean, look,

09:46.249 --> 09:47.382
we already serve
your famous strawberry jam

09:47.450 --> 09:48.317
at the dude ranch,

09:48.384 --> 09:49.418
and everyone loves it.

09:49.486 --> 09:50.952
Grandpa,
he goes through any jar

09:51.020 --> 09:52.254
<i>he can get a hold of.</i>

09:52.322 --> 09:54.021
He does like my jam,
doesn't he?

09:54.089 --> 09:56.524
It'd be the perfect idea
to extend the Heartland brand.

09:56.592 --> 09:59.227
I mean, we start small
and local,

09:59.294 --> 10:00.661
well, I'm flattered, dear,
but...

10:00.729 --> 10:01.762
Hey, are you gonna enter

10:01.830 --> 10:03.397
this Women's Union
Jam-bor-ee?

10:03.465 --> 10:04.798
Heavens, no!

10:04.866 --> 10:07.034
Why not? I mean, uh...
Winning this blue ribbon

10:07.102 --> 10:08.136
would be a great
marketing tool.

10:08.203 --> 10:09.202
Why not try?

10:09.270 --> 10:11.904
Because it's not my idea
of fun.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.575
Do you mind
if I enter, then?

10:15.643 --> 10:17.144
With my recipe?

10:18.179 --> 10:19.412
Ah...I suppose,

10:20.814 --> 10:22.215
if you've got your heart
set on it.

10:22.283 --> 10:24.184
Thanks, Mrs. Bell!

10:25.252 --> 10:27.119
But be careful, dear.

10:27.187 --> 10:30.122
That jam-bor-ee is a nasty
bit of business.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.823
Okay,
I think I can handle

10:31.891 --> 10:34.059
a bunch of jam-making
grannies.

10:34.127 --> 10:35.127
Hmph!

10:36.763 --> 10:38.697
<i>This all is so good!</i>

10:38.765 --> 10:40.533
And thank you all
for inviting me.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.100
We're a pretty hospitable
bunch here.

10:43.169 --> 10:46.937
<i>Unless we're...
given a reason not to be.</i>

10:48.507 --> 10:51.075
<i>C'mon, everyone,
help yourselves.</i>

10:51.143 --> 10:53.844
So, Lily,
what are your plans?

10:53.912 --> 10:55.680
She's startin' a job
in Vancouver next week.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.447
It's no big deal.

10:57.765 --> 10:59.533
<i>It's just an office job.</i>

10:59.600 --> 11:01.301
But there's holidays
and benefits.

11:01.368 --> 11:03.570
Well, here's to holidays
and benefits.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.371
No, no.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.406
Thank you.

11:11.479 --> 11:13.712
I just wanna say somethin'.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.349
There's been many a time

11:17.417 --> 11:19.418
when I've wondered
where my boy was,

11:19.486 --> 11:21.186
and how he was doin'.

11:22.155 --> 11:24.423
But I never let myself hope
he'd be in a place like this,

11:24.491 --> 11:26.291
with such fine people.

11:29.362 --> 11:33.865
So, how long until you...
go back to Vancouver?

11:33.933 --> 11:35.567
I'm hopin' to
stay a few days.

11:35.634 --> 11:36.568
Where?

11:38.471 --> 11:40.572
<i>Well, I'm sure there's room
in one of the cabins.</i>

11:40.639 --> 11:41.639
Isn't there, Lou?

11:43.375 --> 11:44.742
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.977
Um, the couple from Montana
just left this morning.

11:47.044 --> 11:48.612
Oh! That's amazing.

11:50.682 --> 11:51.515
<i>No problem.</i>

11:57.188 --> 11:59.923
So, Amy, Ty tells me
you're quite the busy gal.

11:59.991 --> 12:02.091
A horse whisperer,
no less!

12:07.330 --> 12:08.664
Well, Ty working
with animals,

12:08.732 --> 12:09.932
that's no surprise.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.267
He was always crazy
about 'em.

12:12.335 --> 12:15.270
The two of us used to go
to the zoo every weekend.

12:15.338 --> 12:16.539
I suppose
I'm telling you stuff

12:16.607 --> 12:19.173
Ty's told you
a thousand times.

12:19.241 --> 12:22.644
Actually, Ty's hardly mentioned
anything about you at all.

12:26.048 --> 12:30.251
I guess it was me that liked
goin' the zoo so much.

12:31.988 --> 12:32.921
Ready to go?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.775
Wow!

12:55.843 --> 12:58.310
This is so beautiful here.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.112
You're in this one.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.584
Thank you.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.218
Oh my God!

13:08.521 --> 13:11.189
This is like something
out of a magazine!

13:11.257 --> 13:12.390
I'm gonna be afraid
to touch anything,

13:12.491 --> 13:13.559
I might mess it up.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.163
Okay, well, um...
I start work pretty early,

13:18.230 --> 13:21.366
so I probably won't see you
until uh...

13:22.400 --> 13:23.768
I'm sorry.

13:24.085 --> 13:26.253
I gotta stop doing that.

13:33.295 --> 13:35.129
Susie.
I'll call her back.

13:35.197 --> 13:36.396
Okay, um...

13:37.465 --> 13:39.398
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:39.466 --> 13:40.433
Ty?

13:43.603 --> 13:46.206
Are you embarrassed
by me?

13:46.273 --> 13:47.740
I'm not embarrassed.

13:48.475 --> 13:50.877
Not even if I drag out
some old baby pictures of you,

13:50.945 --> 13:53.779
and show 'em
to all your friends?

13:53.847 --> 13:55.613
Do you even have any
old baby pictures of me?

14:00.686 --> 14:01.619
Good night.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.550
<i>Hey, isn't that Lightning?
Lisa's horse?</i>

14:21.719 --> 14:22.687
Yeah, it was.

14:22.754 --> 14:24.788
I just bought us
a winning ticket,

14:24.855 --> 14:26.355
and you gotta help me
cash it.

14:26.423 --> 14:27.924
You're looking at the underdog
of the year.

14:27.992 --> 14:28.992
Lisa told me
she was selling him

14:29.060 --> 14:30.259
- as a pleasure horse.
- Yeah, well,

14:30.327 --> 14:31.895
she didn't believe
in this guy.

14:31.963 --> 14:32.896
But I do!

14:33.965 --> 14:35.065
And I believe in you.

14:35.132 --> 14:35.999
And I know if anybody
can fix him,

14:36.067 --> 14:37.067
you can.

14:37.134 --> 14:38.367
Dad, I can't.

14:38.435 --> 14:39.368
I can't!

14:39.436 --> 14:40.703
Why?

14:40.770 --> 14:42.805
Because! Lisa already asked me
to help her fix him,

14:42.872 --> 14:44.006
and I... said no!

14:44.074 --> 14:45.474
- I can't turn around and help you!
- No!

14:45.541 --> 14:46.642
Wait a sec, honey.

14:46.710 --> 14:47.643
C'mon.

14:49.112 --> 14:50.813
Look, I don't have
to tell you

14:50.880 --> 14:53.582
that things have been
a little tight for me lately,

14:53.650 --> 14:55.317
and one less horse
in Lisa's stable's

14:55.384 --> 14:57.184
not gonna make
any difference for her.

14:57.252 --> 14:58.720
It can make a world
of difference for me.

14:58.787 --> 14:59.954
For all of us.

15:00.022 --> 15:01.089
<i>You can do this.</i>

15:01.156 --> 15:02.757
Dad, I can't.

15:02.825 --> 15:04.358
Lisa's gonna understand.

15:04.426 --> 15:06.527
She's happy to see this guy
off her hands.

15:06.595 --> 15:08.229
Dad! Do you know
how many horses

15:08.296 --> 15:09.330
Lou has lined up
for me?

15:09.397 --> 15:11.599
And they come first.

15:11.666 --> 15:14.101
I understand that.

15:14.169 --> 15:17.471
If you could just...
just find some time.

15:17.539 --> 15:18.606
Come on, honey,

15:18.673 --> 15:21.007
this is gonna be
a lot of fun.

15:21.074 --> 15:22.875
Okay, I guess.

15:22.943 --> 15:23.809
<i>Amy?</i>

15:24.845 --> 15:26.779
Uh, call for you.

15:26.847 --> 15:28.014
A client.

15:29.783 --> 15:31.050
Thank you.

15:31.118 --> 15:32.118
Who's this?

15:32.186 --> 15:33.486
My new racehorse.

15:33.554 --> 15:35.754
Where do you get off
buying a racehorse?

15:35.821 --> 15:37.856
Too good a deal
to pass up, Jack.

15:37.923 --> 15:40.359
Anybody can see,
this guy's special.

15:40.426 --> 15:41.460
Well, if he was so special,

15:41.528 --> 15:42.861
the owner wouldn't have
sold him cheap.

15:42.928 --> 15:45.130
So they're either a crook
or an idiot.

15:45.198 --> 15:47.065
Well, I wouldn't call
Lisa a crook,

15:47.133 --> 15:48.567
or an idiot.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.737
Well, Lily, you know,
if you don't mind,

15:53.805 --> 15:55.339
I'm gonna put you to work
while you're out here.

15:55.407 --> 15:56.507
Suits me,

15:56.575 --> 15:57.308
as long as I can
keep testing.

15:57.376 --> 15:58.576
All right!

15:58.644 --> 16:00.811
So, uh...

16:00.879 --> 16:02.112
Darn, I thought I had
more of these.

16:02.181 --> 16:04.649
I'm gonna have to go to town
and grab some.

16:04.716 --> 16:05.650
But I'm supposed to keep
skimming this.

16:05.717 --> 16:06.717
Um...

16:06.785 --> 16:08.451
I'll go!
You skim.

16:08.519 --> 16:09.752
Really? Could you?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.854
Yeah! Absolutely.

16:11.922 --> 16:14.524
No.. put it away.
I'll get it.

16:14.592 --> 16:15.758
Thank you.

16:15.826 --> 16:16.759
Take the truck.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.178
So...

16:19.246 --> 16:22.348
Now, you sold Tim
a racehorse?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.382
I didn't sell him
a racehorse,

16:23.450 --> 16:25.183
I sold him
a bit of a headache.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.919
Well, headache or not,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.286
he thinks he's got
the next winner

16:28.354 --> 16:31.022
of the Kentucky derby.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.223
For that to happen,

16:32.291 --> 16:33.992
he would have to get
the horse into the gate,

16:34.060 --> 16:36.428
and Lightning absolutely
refuses to do that.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.264
Maybe, but seems
he's got Amy on board

16:39.332 --> 16:41.999
to fix that
particular problem.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.768
Amy's working with Lightning?!

16:43.836 --> 16:45.102
That's the plan.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.238
What?

16:48.306 --> 16:50.475
I asked her to work with him.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.577
She said she couldn't,
she didn't have time.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.611
Ah!

16:53.679 --> 16:57.046
You know what?
That's fine.

16:57.114 --> 16:59.315
I just...
that's fine.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.588
That'll be $15.83.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.321
So, Lou's really entering
the jam contest.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.358
Yeah, she is in full
competitive mode.

17:08.425 --> 17:09.960
This girl
from her old high school

17:10.027 --> 17:12.494
is the entrepreneur
of the month in this magazine,

17:12.561 --> 17:14.029
and Lou can't cope,

17:14.097 --> 17:16.164
so she talked Mrs. Bell
into helping.

17:16.232 --> 17:17.599
<i>Oh my God,
poor Mrs. Bell.</i>

17:18.768 --> 17:20.502
Oh, um...
I'm sorry,

17:20.569 --> 17:23.070
your credit card's
been declined...

17:23.138 --> 17:25.307
Really? I...

17:25.375 --> 17:26.407
You know what?

17:26.476 --> 17:27.642
Just pay it
next time you're in.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.778
I'm so sorry,
it must've expired.

17:30.846 --> 17:32.179
Thank you.

17:33.148 --> 17:34.716
<i>I'll grab that.</i>

17:34.783 --> 17:35.750
Thank you.

17:35.818 --> 17:36.751
Bye.

17:39.021 --> 17:41.322
Okay, be careful now.
He might kick or rear.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.590
Okay, okay.

17:47.161 --> 17:48.094
You're a good boy.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.601
Or he may do the unexpected.

17:56.303 --> 17:57.738
Well, um...

17:57.805 --> 18:00.006
At least you know he's not
afraid of confined spaces,

18:00.073 --> 18:01.541
- it's a start.
- That's a great start!

18:01.608 --> 18:03.108
Okay, we gotta keep
the ball rolling.

18:03.176 --> 18:05.177
We gotta get him to the track
and put him in a real gate.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.946
Dad, you said my client horses
came first.

18:07.014 --> 18:08.948
I gotta go work
with Kabuki.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.083
Yeah.
Oh no, yeah.

18:11.151 --> 18:13.218
You gotta...
you gotta do that.

18:13.286 --> 18:14.854
Just...
Don't take too long!

18:20.092 --> 18:21.192
It's good...

18:22.227 --> 18:23.261
But it's not great.

18:24.363 --> 18:25.897
Something's missing.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.600
I'm gonna call Mrs. Bell.

18:28.668 --> 18:30.101
Maybe it needs more sugar.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.735
No, it's not...

18:31.803 --> 18:33.203
It's... there's...

18:34.806 --> 18:35.940
Sometimes she can't hear
the phone;

18:36.007 --> 18:38.976
She can't hear very well.

18:39.044 --> 18:40.811
<i>You know,
i'm just gonna go</i>

18:40.879 --> 18:42.913
pick her up,
bring her back.

18:42.981 --> 18:44.381
You wanna come?

18:44.449 --> 18:45.549
No, I'm gonna stay.

18:45.617 --> 18:47.184
Ty said he'd be home
around now.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.819
Yeah, yeah, he should be
back from the track...

18:49.887 --> 18:51.353
Yup, any time now.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.889
The track...
the racetrack?

18:52.957 --> 18:54.223
Yeah.
In Hudson.

18:55.358 --> 18:57.259
I'll see you later.

19:01.665 --> 19:05.100
You weren't
straight up with Lisa!

19:05.167 --> 19:07.736
I wasn't straight up
with Lisa?

19:07.804 --> 19:09.304
<i>I was just doin' business,
Jack.</i>

19:09.371 --> 19:10.538
People buy and sell horses
every day.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.207
As soon as you start
dragging Amy

19:12.274 --> 19:13.341
into your little schemes,

19:13.409 --> 19:14.409
it turns into my business!

19:14.477 --> 19:15.911
I didn't drag Amy
into anything!

19:15.979 --> 19:18.313
She's got enough
on her plate!

19:18.380 --> 19:21.048
Well, let's let her
be the judge of that.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.851
Hey there, buddy.

19:23.919 --> 19:25.486
Remember me?

19:25.553 --> 19:26.887
Hey, Mrs. Bell!

19:26.955 --> 19:28.422
Oh, hello, Lou.

19:28.490 --> 19:30.591
So, you're Lou Fleming?

19:30.659 --> 19:32.226
Yes.

19:32.293 --> 19:34.428
Well, I'm glad we ran
into each other.

19:34.496 --> 19:36.029
I'm Pearl Arsenault
and this is...

19:36.097 --> 19:37.864
Uh, Florence Rook.

19:37.932 --> 19:40.900
Head of the Hudson
Women's Union.

19:40.968 --> 19:44.403
Oh! So you're in charge
of this year's jam-bor-ee!

19:46.040 --> 19:46.973
Yes.

19:49.043 --> 19:50.844
And we were just saying
to Sally here,

19:50.911 --> 19:52.477
<i>that, uh...</i>

19:52.545 --> 19:54.913
Well, I sincerely hope
that you're not thinking

19:54.981 --> 19:57.482
of entering her recipe.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.051
Oh! Well, yes.

19:59.119 --> 20:01.020
I am. Definitely.

20:01.087 --> 20:03.388
It's strictly against
regulation for anyone to enter

20:03.456 --> 20:06.892
using a recipe
that is not their own.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.559
It wouldn't be
a good idea

20:08.661 --> 20:10.327
to go down that road.

20:11.930 --> 20:12.930
Really?

20:12.998 --> 20:14.666
Well, uh...

20:14.733 --> 20:18.002
What if Mrs. Bell and I
entered as partners?

20:18.070 --> 20:21.105
Would that be against
the "Union" regulations?

20:22.641 --> 20:23.840
Would it?

20:23.908 --> 20:26.109
Well, well
no, I suppose not.

20:26.177 --> 20:27.477
Not... technically.

20:28.579 --> 20:30.380
Well, then,
we'll see you Saturday.

20:30.447 --> 20:32.515
Won't we,
Mrs. Bell?

20:37.288 --> 20:40.056
I'm afraid you've made
a mortal enemy, dear.

20:40.123 --> 20:41.924
You don't mess
with Pearl Arsenault.

20:43.026 --> 20:45.094
She wins every year.

20:45.696 --> 20:47.930
Maybe not every year.

20:49.265 --> 20:50.299
Are you in?

20:51.334 --> 20:52.702
Absolutely.

20:55.305 --> 20:57.137
Hey.
What's up?

20:57.206 --> 20:58.573
Where were you?

20:58.640 --> 20:59.574
Work.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.677
Really?

21:02.744 --> 21:04.778
Lou told me
you were at the track.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.714
Well, I was,
I mean, that's where I...

21:06.781 --> 21:09.149
You've got a great life
for yourself here, Ty.

21:09.218 --> 21:10.951
Don't throw it all away.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.052
What're you talking about?

21:12.153 --> 21:13.820
Don't you get it?

21:13.887 --> 21:15.188
This is exactly what happened.

21:15.256 --> 21:16.256
He would spend
every waking hour

21:16.324 --> 21:17.424
at the track.

21:17.491 --> 21:18.891
Gambling all the money
we ever made -

21:18.959 --> 21:20.193
- it wasn't much!
- Who?

21:20.261 --> 21:22.929
Wade.
And every time...

21:22.996 --> 21:25.232
<i>You cannot compare me
to him!</i>

21:26.066 --> 21:28.134
<i>The only reason
i'm at the track</i>

21:28.202 --> 21:29.435
<i>- is to earn money.
- I don't care!</i>

21:29.502 --> 21:30.969
I don't want you
anywhere near the place!

21:31.037 --> 21:33.839
No! You don't get
to do that!

21:33.906 --> 21:35.140
<i>You don't get to tell me
what you want,</i>

21:35.208 --> 21:37.042
or don't want me to do.

21:37.110 --> 21:38.644
You gave up that right
years ago!

21:46.084 --> 21:48.419
<i>She was like,
so totally embarrassed.</i>

21:48.487 --> 21:50.154
I felt so bad for her.

21:50.222 --> 21:51.623
Then it's probably best

21:51.690 --> 21:53.991
you keep this story
to yourself...

21:54.059 --> 21:55.326
For a change.

21:55.394 --> 21:57.262
I never wanna end up
in that situation, Jack.

21:57.329 --> 21:58.730
You were right,

21:58.797 --> 22:01.365
I need to some gold
for my golden years!

22:01.432 --> 22:03.967
Well, I think I can help you
on that score.

22:09.874 --> 22:12.442
This doesn't taste
the same.

22:12.510 --> 22:13.910
It's different somehow.

22:13.978 --> 22:15.445
You're right.

22:15.513 --> 22:16.746
It's good.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.381
But it isn't great.

22:21.818 --> 22:22.885
Okay, Amy,
just take it easy.

22:22.952 --> 22:23.852
You ready?

22:23.920 --> 22:24.987
Relax, Dad.

22:25.054 --> 22:26.255
I'm relaxed.

22:33.796 --> 22:35.530
Easy, easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:35.631 --> 22:37.799
Easy, easy, easy.

22:37.866 --> 22:39.367
Sorry.
Stupid cell.

22:43.272 --> 22:44.238
Lisa...

22:45.874 --> 22:47.575
<i>No! Lisa, wait!</i>

22:48.510 --> 22:49.209
Amy, hey!

22:51.780 --> 22:53.480
Lisa!

22:53.548 --> 22:55.248
<i>Lisa, please!</i>

22:55.317 --> 22:57.284
I'm, I'm so sorry.

22:57.352 --> 22:58.285
That your father
would do something like this

22:58.353 --> 23:00.587
does not surprise me.

23:00.655 --> 23:01.955
But I would expect
that you and I...

23:02.023 --> 23:04.557
could be straight
with each other.

23:09.114 --> 23:11.113
<i>I shouldn't
have yelled at her.</i>

23:11.114 --> 23:12.414
<i>I guess she's just worried.</i>

23:12.482 --> 23:14.850
Since when?

23:14.918 --> 23:16.317
Since yesterday?

23:16.385 --> 23:18.119
Ty, you're working three jobs
to pay for vet school,

23:18.187 --> 23:19.387
and she shows up

23:19.455 --> 23:20.756
and thinks she can
just order you around?

23:20.857 --> 23:21.957
I know,

23:22.025 --> 23:22.991
I tried to explain that
to her,

23:23.059 --> 23:24.292
but she didn't wanna listen.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.561
I'd be happy to tell her.

23:27.396 --> 23:28.463
She's my mom,

23:28.531 --> 23:29.531
how do you expect me
to feel about this?

23:29.565 --> 23:31.132
I know she's your mom, Ty.

23:31.199 --> 23:33.401
But all I see is a woman
who really hurt you.

23:33.468 --> 23:34.736
Look, Amy,

23:34.803 --> 23:35.770
you don't know what
she's been through,

23:35.838 --> 23:36.871
and you don't know her,
so...

23:36.939 --> 23:38.372
You're right,
I don't know her,

23:38.440 --> 23:39.473
and maybe you don't either.

23:40.976 --> 23:42.043
Wha...

23:42.110 --> 23:43.645
Whoa!

23:43.712 --> 23:44.846
Someone's in a mood.

23:44.914 --> 23:47.147
I'm not in a mood!
I'm just...

23:49.784 --> 23:52.853
I'm just mad...
at everything,

23:52.921 --> 23:53.988
and at myself.

23:56.224 --> 23:57.157
I'm sorry.

23:59.027 --> 24:01.294
Hey...

24:01.362 --> 24:02.762
What's up?

24:02.830 --> 24:04.398
Lisa hates me.

24:06.334 --> 24:08.535
I screwed up
really bad.

24:14.142 --> 24:16.343
<i>You got a minute?</i>

24:17.612 --> 24:19.446
I blew it,
with Ty.

24:22.516 --> 24:23.450
I actually thought
I had a right to tell him

24:23.517 --> 24:24.417
how to live his life.

24:24.485 --> 24:25.852
Smart, huh?

24:26.820 --> 24:30.056
When I haven't even been
a part of it.

24:30.124 --> 24:32.959
Okay, Lily.

24:33.027 --> 24:36.528
I've, uh, I've gotten
to know you a little bit...

24:36.596 --> 24:39.432
Over the last few days,
and...

24:39.499 --> 24:41.733
Well,
I'm just gonna ask ya.

24:42.735 --> 24:44.303
Why so many years?

24:46.406 --> 24:49.442
It went by um...
In kind of a haze.

24:52.245 --> 24:54.413
I know that sounds
like a complete cop out.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.348
Well, because it is.

24:57.450 --> 24:59.351
I want you
to level with me.

25:01.321 --> 25:02.821
Why didn't you ever
look him up?

25:02.888 --> 25:04.389
He's your son!

25:04.457 --> 25:05.824
Because I was afraid.

25:07.592 --> 25:08.993
Wade's got this...

25:09.061 --> 25:11.930
This real...
jealous streak,

25:11.997 --> 25:14.198
and... I knew that

25:14.266 --> 25:16.200
if he thought
I was seeing Ty,

25:16.268 --> 25:18.536
he would wanna hurt him.

25:18.603 --> 25:19.837
Maybe worse.

25:19.905 --> 25:21.372
So I stayed away.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.207
Sometimes I think
being taken from me

25:23.275 --> 25:24.241
was the best thing

25:24.309 --> 25:26.911
that could've ever happened
to Ty.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.316
My daughter died
a couple years ago,

25:32.384 --> 25:35.019
and I can't imagine
for the life of me

25:35.086 --> 25:39.289
that Amy or Lou are better off
without their mother.

25:43.394 --> 25:45.678
Do you think
it's too late?

25:48.048 --> 25:50.450
To be Ty's... mom again?

25:50.798 --> 25:52.050
Do you?

25:55.755 --> 25:57.189
Then I guess
it isn't.

25:57.257 --> 25:59.558
But you have to tell him
what you did.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.026
You owe him that.

26:06.366 --> 26:07.366
I don't get it.

26:07.434 --> 26:09.034
I mean my batch
just tastes...

26:09.102 --> 26:10.202
Different.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.370
It's probably best
we start from scratch.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.340
Mm! But I followed
your recipe exactly!

26:15.408 --> 26:16.874
Lou, dear,

26:16.942 --> 26:19.677
there's a little something
I left out of the recipe.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.481
A secret ingredient.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.515
You're kidding!

26:24.950 --> 26:26.184
I don't like to write it

26:26.251 --> 26:28.152
in the list
of ingredients.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.020
People will think
I'm an old lush.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.926
Good boy!

26:35.994 --> 26:37.395
That's better!
That's better!

26:37.463 --> 26:39.397
Kabuki's come
a long way!

26:39.465 --> 26:41.599
Yeah, he has.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.333
Okay.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.235
I talked to Lisa.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.472
She's really mad at me.
I...

26:48.539 --> 26:51.208
She's a little put out,
all right,

26:51.275 --> 26:53.743
but I'm blaming
your father for that.

26:53.811 --> 26:54.978
He should never have
put you in this position

26:55.045 --> 26:56.113
to begin with.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.714
Well, it's not
all his fault.

26:58.782 --> 27:00.683
I mean,
I should've just said no.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.086
I knew I didn't have time
for...

27:03.403 --> 27:05.037
For anything.

27:05.104 --> 27:07.039
I'm totally useless with Ty
and his mom.

27:07.106 --> 27:09.542
Well, you have spread
yourself mighty thin.

27:09.609 --> 27:11.176
If I could just
fix one thing,

27:11.244 --> 27:13.412
I would feel
a lot better.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.713
Well,

27:14.781 --> 27:18.216
if you can tell me
what kind of flowers say:

27:18.284 --> 27:21.787
"Sorry but my ex-son-in-law
is a jackass,"

27:23.423 --> 27:24.989
I would be real grateful.

27:26.225 --> 27:27.592
<i>Mallory, right?</i>

27:27.660 --> 27:28.593
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

27:28.661 --> 27:29.894
<i>Jack called.</i>

27:29.962 --> 27:31.462
He gave me a rough idea
of what you're looking for.

27:31.530 --> 27:33.765
I think you'll be very happy
with this student package.

27:33.832 --> 27:34.832
It gives you
a lot of...

27:34.900 --> 27:38.169
What have you got
in the way of RRSPs?

27:38.236 --> 27:39.136
If that's what
you're after,

27:39.204 --> 27:40.838
uh...

27:40.906 --> 27:43.107
This'll be
interesting to you.

27:43.175 --> 27:45.242
I think we need to talk
about your goals.

27:45.311 --> 27:46.977
Retiring at 30?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.814
Okay.
Let's get you started.

27:55.587 --> 27:57.821
Hi! Uh, is Lisa here?

27:57.889 --> 28:00.557
Oh, no, sorry.
She's not around.

28:00.625 --> 28:01.692
Can you just tell her

28:01.760 --> 28:03.526
that Amy wants to talk
to her?

28:03.594 --> 28:05.094
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

28:05.162 --> 28:07.731
Um, you rode Lightning,
right?

28:07.798 --> 28:10.567
Yeah, ever since
he came to Fairfield.

28:10.635 --> 28:13.737
Great horse,
until he started acting up.

28:13.804 --> 28:15.838
What do you think
made him start?

28:16.156 --> 28:17.123
I don't know.

28:17.190 --> 28:18.557
You know what
racehorses are like.

28:18.625 --> 28:21.460
They're moody,
temperamental.

28:21.528 --> 28:22.995
Could be any number
of things.

28:23.062 --> 28:24.497
Yeah.

28:24.564 --> 28:26.298
Um...it's weird,

28:26.366 --> 28:28.701
he has this thing
with phones.

28:28.768 --> 28:30.235
Um, I put mine on vibrate,

28:30.303 --> 28:33.071
and he still freaked out.

28:33.139 --> 28:35.273
He never did that with you,
did he?

28:35.341 --> 28:36.475
Well, for one thing,

28:36.542 --> 28:38.643
I'd never have my phone on me
when I'm riding.

28:42.047 --> 28:44.248
I'll, uh,
tell Lisa you stopped by.

28:44.316 --> 28:45.984
<i- >- - my: Okay.
am: Okay.

29:08.773 --> 29:11.207
Don't call,
I told you.

29:11.275 --> 29:14.945
I don't wanna hear it.
I want you to stop now!

29:18.450 --> 29:20.050
Hey.

29:20.117 --> 29:21.117
Hey.

29:22.119 --> 29:24.186
Who were you talking to?

29:24.254 --> 29:26.188
Susie. In Toronto.

29:28.258 --> 29:31.528
- Look, uh...
- Me first.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.163
I was completely
out of line.

29:34.231 --> 29:38.000
God, who am I to tell anybody
to do anything.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.668
I know why you said
what you did.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.036
No, Ty.

29:42.138 --> 29:45.107
I'm so...

29:45.424 --> 29:46.424
So sorry.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.163
It's okay, I...

29:51.230 --> 29:52.631
No, it's not okay.

29:56.468 --> 29:57.736
You know,
when your dad left,

29:57.803 --> 30:00.972
I... felt things spinning
out of control,

30:02.574 --> 30:03.642
and then I met Wade,

30:03.709 --> 30:04.542
and I thought
he was gonna help us

30:04.610 --> 30:07.245
put our lives back together.

30:07.312 --> 30:09.047
But what that man
did to you...

30:09.115 --> 30:10.148
And to you.

30:12.818 --> 30:14.719
When they took you away,

30:16.454 --> 30:19.724
things didn't get better,
they got worse,

30:22.828 --> 30:26.730
and I just couldn't bring
you back into that.

30:26.798 --> 30:29.933
But I was your mother
and I should've protected you.

30:32.269 --> 30:34.771
There's so many things
I wanna tell you.

30:34.839 --> 30:37.574
Mom, it...it's okay,
we have time.

30:41.512 --> 30:42.912
What's the matter?

30:46.050 --> 30:47.216
You called me "mom."

31:00.597 --> 31:02.163
Hey.

31:02.231 --> 31:03.732
Hey.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.068
How are things goin'
with your mom?

31:06.135 --> 31:08.103
Uh, better, I think.

31:09.271 --> 31:11.106
It's still a little weird,
but...

31:11.173 --> 31:12.808
It's better.

31:14.593 --> 31:17.829
I went to see Lisa, today,
about Lightning?

31:17.896 --> 31:20.631
She wasn't there, though,
just her jockey.

31:20.699 --> 31:21.732
Mm. Liam?

31:23.936 --> 31:25.602
I told him how
the horse freaked out

31:25.670 --> 31:27.538
when my phone
started vibrating,

31:27.605 --> 31:29.506
best he could
come up with was,

31:29.574 --> 31:31.474
"well, I never wear my phone
when I'm riding."

31:31.542 --> 31:34.044
Guy's a jerk.

31:34.112 --> 31:35.378
Big practical joker,
too.

31:35.446 --> 31:37.347
He did that whole,
uh, handshake trick on me,

31:37.415 --> 31:38.949
with the buzzer thing.

31:39.017 --> 31:40.383
Liam had a buzzer?

31:40.451 --> 31:42.853
Yeah, except it was more
like an electrical shock!

31:42.921 --> 31:45.055
Ty, I've heard about this.

31:45.123 --> 31:46.389
Jockeys zapping horses
with buzzers

31:46.457 --> 31:48.757
just to get them out
of the starting gate faster.

31:48.826 --> 31:50.126
This is illegal!

31:51.661 --> 31:52.695
Do you think Lisa knows
about this?

31:55.665 --> 31:58.000
Lisa!

32:02.539 --> 32:04.339
Lisa, are you in there?

32:11.480 --> 32:13.081
I don't think he'd leave it
laying around.

32:13.149 --> 32:15.317
Yeah, well, he showed it to you,
didn't he?

32:22.008 --> 32:23.292
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:29.144 --> 32:31.014
What were you two
doing in my trailer?

32:31.850 --> 32:34.219
We were just looking
for a buzzer.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.553
Yeah. I...

32:35.621 --> 32:37.255
I think the reason
that Lightning is refusing

32:37.322 --> 32:38.256
is 'cause someone
was shocking him

32:38.323 --> 32:39.824
to get him out
of the gate faster!

32:39.892 --> 32:41.292
Are you
accusing me?!

32:41.360 --> 32:42.260
<i>Lightning was fine</i>

32:42.327 --> 32:43.228
when we brought him
to Heartland;

32:43.295 --> 32:44.361
He went in the gate
no problem.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.495
And you said
that was the same

32:45.563 --> 32:46.597
<i>at gate school.</i>

32:46.664 --> 32:47.965
But at the track,

32:48.033 --> 32:49.200
my cell phone
started vibrating,

32:49.267 --> 32:50.367
and he went nuts!

32:50.435 --> 32:51.869
Yeah, 'cause horses
are sensitive

32:51.937 --> 32:53.370
to all kinds of vibration.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.040
Like the kind you get
from a buzzer?

32:56.108 --> 32:57.307
He shocked Ty
the other day.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.544
That's right.
Yeah, as a joke.

33:02.613 --> 33:03.546
I wouldn't do anything

33:03.614 --> 33:04.581
to harm
any of our horses.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.785
<i>Is that it?</i>

33:08.853 --> 33:10.253
Is that the proof?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.588
<i>Amy, honestly,</i>

33:11.655 --> 33:13.090
I don't know what to say
at this point.

33:19.329 --> 33:21.663
Amy, I just got off
the phone with Lisa!

33:21.732 --> 33:23.232
What were you thinking, Amy?

33:23.299 --> 33:24.566
<i>Going through her trailer?!</i>

33:24.634 --> 33:25.968
Lisa's jockey
was buzzing Lightning

33:26.036 --> 33:27.036
at the starting gate!

33:27.104 --> 33:28.938
You don't have any evidence
of that!

33:29.005 --> 33:30.005
Yes, I do!

33:30.073 --> 33:31.040
Lightning is the evidence!

33:31.108 --> 33:33.341
His behaviour
is the evidence!

33:33.409 --> 33:35.276
You know those early races
that he won?

33:35.344 --> 33:37.579
Liam probably buzzed him
just to get him moving.

33:38.614 --> 33:40.548
<i>But then, it backfired.</i>

33:40.616 --> 33:41.883
The horse expects the shock
and reacts,

33:41.951 --> 33:43.618
even when it doesn't happen!

33:43.686 --> 33:45.053
The only time he refused

33:45.121 --> 33:46.855
was when Liam rode him
to the starting gate and...

33:46.923 --> 33:48.622
And when
you rode him.

33:48.691 --> 33:50.391
Yeah, but that's 'cause
my cell phone buzzed!

33:50.458 --> 33:52.060
Only a horse that was already
super sensitive

33:52.127 --> 33:53.194
would react like that!

33:53.261 --> 33:54.261
<i>Okay!</i>

33:55.430 --> 33:58.199
Just let me think
about this.

34:00.569 --> 34:03.071
Dad, I should've never
helped you with Lightning

34:03.138 --> 34:04.471
after I told Lisa
I couldn't.

34:04.539 --> 34:05.706
Well,
you could've said "no."

34:05.774 --> 34:07.041
I can't,
not to you.

34:07.108 --> 34:09.208
Yeah, you can.
Just try it.

34:09.277 --> 34:10.878
"No, Dad!"
See?

34:10.945 --> 34:12.980
Dad,
it's not that easy!

34:14.549 --> 34:16.916
So...
How's Lightning doing?

34:16.984 --> 34:18.016
Dad!

34:18.085 --> 34:20.152
Just askin'.

34:22.656 --> 34:24.524
I'm almost finished
working with him.

34:24.591 --> 34:26.058
Good.

34:26.126 --> 34:27.860
Well, we should get him
back to the track.

34:30.797 --> 34:32.565
<i>Steady...
Easy, boy.</i>

34:32.666 --> 34:34.199
Good boy!

34:34.601 --> 34:35.635
<i>You know, the first time
I rode a horse</i>

34:35.702 --> 34:36.900
was on a school trip.

34:36.969 --> 34:38.803
Ha! He was a beautiful animal,

34:38.871 --> 34:40.272
not very well trained.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.774
I took the reins in my hands,
he galloped away with me.

34:45.545 --> 34:48.079
Do you wanna help me
with something?

34:48.148 --> 34:49.148
Do you have
a cell phone?

34:52.351 --> 34:53.518
Thank you.

34:56.455 --> 34:57.755
All right.

34:57.823 --> 34:59.690
Two seconds.

34:59.758 --> 35:00.725
Come're you!

35:01.727 --> 35:03.428
Far away!

35:03.496 --> 35:05.096
Okay, text me.

35:05.164 --> 35:06.331
What should I write?

35:06.398 --> 35:07.398
Whatever.

35:12.804 --> 35:14.438
Good boy!
There 'ya go!

35:15.607 --> 35:16.873
What're you doing?

35:16.941 --> 35:19.143
Well, every time it buzzes,
I give him a treat.

35:19.211 --> 35:20.978
It's positive reinforcement.

35:21.045 --> 35:24.214
So he actually looks forward
to a little buzz.

35:24.282 --> 35:26.216
Well, I know how that feels.

35:27.351 --> 35:28.818
I'm just kidding.

35:29.136 --> 35:31.103
Little addiction humour.

35:42.449 --> 35:43.416
Okay.

35:44.484 --> 35:45.785
I talked to Amy.

35:47.253 --> 35:49.888
I don't know this Liam
from Adam,

35:49.956 --> 35:52.090
but I do know about life
on the track.

35:52.158 --> 35:53.492
<i>I've seen plenty happen</i>

35:53.560 --> 35:56.195
<i>when folks think
nobody's watching.</i>

35:56.262 --> 35:57.596
Now, Amy knows horses,

35:57.664 --> 35:59.331
and I do believe
they tell her things

35:59.399 --> 36:02.100
that the rest of us
can't hear.

36:02.168 --> 36:04.836
<i>And what this horse
is telling her</i>

36:04.904 --> 36:07.071
is that your jockey
buzzed it.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.241
I don't think you should
get involved in this, Jack.

36:10.310 --> 36:11.276
I really don't!

36:11.344 --> 36:12.710
Believe me, I...

36:15.714 --> 36:17.114
Just...

36:17.182 --> 36:20.785
Just promise me
that you'll check him out.

36:24.590 --> 36:26.123
Hi, Mike!
Me again.

36:27.058 --> 36:29.025
I'm thinking about starting
an investment portfolio,

36:29.093 --> 36:30.761
<i>and I need some advice.</i>

36:30.828 --> 36:33.063
Yeah. I've been tracking
a mining stock

36:33.131 --> 36:34.431
<i>for the last 24 hours.</i>

36:34.499 --> 36:36.267
<i>It's down 17 cents!</i>

36:36.334 --> 36:37.334
Just one second,

36:37.402 --> 36:39.370
there's a call
on the other line.

36:41.473 --> 36:42.706
Heartland Equestrian
Connection.

36:42.774 --> 36:43.707
How can I help you?

36:45.626 --> 36:46.593
Um, Lily?

36:46.660 --> 36:48.728
She's right beside me.

36:48.796 --> 36:51.564
<i>But I'm on the other line.
Can she call you back?</i>

36:51.632 --> 36:53.099
Hello?

36:53.166 --> 36:54.901
Hello.

36:54.969 --> 36:55.902
Rude.

36:55.970 --> 36:57.370
Who was that?

36:57.437 --> 36:59.271
Some guy wanted
to talk to you.

37:01.608 --> 37:02.842
Are you okay?

37:04.478 --> 37:06.078
I feel a little off.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.146
Can you tell Lou

37:08.214 --> 37:09.915
that I won't make it
to the jam-bor-ee?

37:09.983 --> 37:10.983
Okay.

37:14.554 --> 37:15.921
Hi Mike,
sorry about that.

37:15.989 --> 37:19.090
As I was saying,
the markets are a bit unstable.

37:19.158 --> 37:20.425
Yeah, sure.
I can come in and talk.

37:22.428 --> 37:25.363
Hey, the mining stock
just went up 22 cents!

37:25.431 --> 37:27.933
Thanks a lot, Mike!
You're awesome!

37:28.000 --> 37:28.900
Okay, see you soon.

37:34.372 --> 37:35.540
Take one.

37:35.607 --> 37:38.943
Mrs. Bell's famous
strawberry jam.

37:39.010 --> 37:41.078
Heartland Preserves:
We're new this year.

37:42.147 --> 37:44.148
I'm sorry,

37:44.215 --> 37:46.684
but pamphlets advertising
your product

37:46.752 --> 37:48.852
are strictly
against regulations.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.989
Oh, did... did you mean
these regulations?

37:53.057 --> 37:54.124
Hmm...

37:54.191 --> 37:55.893
'Cause I could've sworn
I saw right here,

37:55.960 --> 37:59.029
under section 13,
paragraph nine,

37:59.096 --> 38:01.064
<i>that "first time participants
are permitted</i>"

38:01.132 --> 38:04.301
to distribute
introductory information."

38:04.368 --> 38:05.602
Hmm...

38:05.669 --> 38:09.338
Red and white gingham,
and a pretty ribbon.

38:09.407 --> 38:10.573
How quaint.

38:10.641 --> 38:13.276
Mm. I'm so glad
you think so.

38:15.613 --> 38:18.314
Uh, attention, everybody!

38:18.382 --> 38:19.516
Uh, attention!

38:20.717 --> 38:23.819
I would like to introduce
our judges...

38:24.721 --> 38:29.290
And our special guest judge,
Martin MacInnes!

38:31.394 --> 38:34.396
- Hello.
- So glad to see you.

38:34.464 --> 38:35.564
Oh!

38:35.631 --> 38:37.699
How wonderful to see you!

38:38.017 --> 38:39.550
We don't have a shot,
do we?

38:40.620 --> 38:42.587
Not a snowball's chance
in hell.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.366
Judge, for you.

38:56.434 --> 38:57.401
Ah!

38:58.936 --> 39:00.536
Thank you.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.205
Is she handing out swag bags?!

39:03.240 --> 39:06.175
That is against
regulations!

39:06.243 --> 39:07.210
I think.

39:08.613 --> 39:09.613
Damn, she's good.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.117
<i>Liam.</i>

39:14.184 --> 39:15.450
- Yeah?
- Can I speak to you, please?

39:15.518 --> 39:17.285
Yeah.

39:17.353 --> 39:19.755
I will not require
your services any longer.

39:19.823 --> 39:21.356
What?

39:21.424 --> 39:24.093
I found these in
your locker at Fairfield.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.193
Okay.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.664
You gotta understand
something.

39:28.732 --> 39:31.700
It was only for
his very first races -

39:31.767 --> 39:33.334
we needed an edge -

39:33.435 --> 39:34.368
and then I stopped.

39:34.436 --> 39:36.337
I swear, I had no idea

39:36.405 --> 39:37.706
that he'd react that way,
Ms. Stillman.

39:37.773 --> 39:39.774
I reported you
to the steward's office.

39:39.842 --> 39:42.010
You won't be welcome at Hudson
any time soon,

39:42.078 --> 39:44.378
or any other racetrack,
I certainly hope.

39:44.446 --> 39:47.281
You know what?
You're all the same.

39:47.348 --> 39:49.984
Everybody knows
what goes on here,

39:50.886 --> 39:53.988
and as long as you're winning,
you turn a blind eye.

39:54.056 --> 39:55.623
<i>But as soon as you need
a scapegoat...</i>

39:55.691 --> 39:57.725
I think you'd
better start packin'.

40:04.198 --> 40:05.699
<i>Mom? You okay?</i>

40:07.936 --> 40:08.936
Lou called,

40:09.003 --> 40:10.671
she said you weren't
feeling so well.

40:13.074 --> 40:14.608
I thought you said
you had a few more days.

40:14.676 --> 40:16.109
Nope.

40:16.177 --> 40:17.844
I'm heading out now.

40:18.879 --> 40:20.279
Thanks for telling me.

40:20.347 --> 40:21.313
Ty?!

40:23.717 --> 40:25.919
Ty, it's not
what it looks like!

40:25.986 --> 40:26.819
Then what does it look like?

40:26.887 --> 40:27.820
- Please, Ty.
- Come on,

40:27.888 --> 40:28.988
tell me
what it looks like!

40:29.056 --> 40:30.957
How about running away?
How's that?

40:31.025 --> 40:32.358
Running away, abandoning,
disappearing.

40:32.426 --> 40:33.693
No!

40:33.761 --> 40:35.928
You knew I was always
going back to Vancouver.

40:36.246 --> 40:38.080
Yeah.

40:38.148 --> 40:39.714
You know, you're exactly
the same as you used to be.

40:39.783 --> 40:40.916
You haven't changed
one bit.

40:40.984 --> 40:42.284
No!

40:42.351 --> 40:44.386
I am turning my life around.

40:44.453 --> 40:45.320
Really?

40:46.389 --> 40:48.590
That new job
you got lined up?

40:48.658 --> 40:50.592
Does that even exist?

40:50.660 --> 40:51.592
No.

40:53.028 --> 40:53.795
You didn't come
all the way out here

40:53.863 --> 40:55.696
just to see me,
did you?

40:55.765 --> 40:57.098
No.

40:57.166 --> 40:58.099
Not at first.

40:58.167 --> 40:59.634
Why are you here?

41:02.938 --> 41:05.173
I had nowhere else
to go.

41:06.275 --> 41:08.809
It's Wade.
He's found me.

41:15.776 --> 41:17.376
<i>There she is.</i>

41:19.613 --> 41:20.713
Look...

41:20.781 --> 41:21.814
Lisa,
I wanna apologize.

41:21.882 --> 41:22.882
Nope.

41:22.950 --> 41:24.717
It's my turn
to say I'm sorry.

41:24.785 --> 41:26.552
Found that
in Liam's locker.

41:26.653 --> 41:27.686
You were right.

41:27.754 --> 41:29.388
He admitted it.

41:29.455 --> 41:30.422
You're not a pleasure horse
after all,

41:30.490 --> 41:32.090
are you buddy?

41:32.158 --> 41:33.592
My loss.

41:33.660 --> 41:34.994
Come here.

41:37.330 --> 41:41.466
And the winner of
the first place blue ribbon

41:41.535 --> 41:43.034
<i>goes to...</i>

41:43.102 --> 41:44.369
Pearl Arsenault.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.642
<i>Congratulations, Pearl!</i>

41:52.778 --> 41:54.345
Well, that was a close one...

41:56.048 --> 41:57.281
Sort of.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.249
But I really loved
your jam.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.185
You know, I've never tasted
anything like it.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.020
It was the secret ingredient.

42:03.088 --> 42:05.289
Uh, I'm Martin.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.558
I manage
the Hudson Supermarket.

42:07.626 --> 42:08.659
I'm not sure
if you know,

42:08.727 --> 42:10.094
but I have a section
in my store

42:10.161 --> 42:11.328
dedicated to local products.

42:11.396 --> 42:13.430
Yeah, I do,
actually.

42:13.499 --> 42:15.031
Well, I'd love to carry
a few jars

42:15.099 --> 42:17.300
of your Heartland Preserve
on our shelves.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.002
Thank you.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.571
So you see, Lou,

42:20.638 --> 42:22.573
there is no sense
getting caught up

42:22.640 --> 42:24.207
in petty
competition squabbles!

42:24.308 --> 42:26.142
Hey, Pearl!

42:26.210 --> 42:28.645
Guess whose jam is hitting
a supermarket shelf near you?!

42:30.881 --> 42:32.782
That's right.
Heartland.

42:34.919 --> 42:36.385
Ready to do this?

42:40.925 --> 42:42.659
Whoa, whoa,
easy. Easy.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.226
<i>Okay. It's okay, boy.
It's okay.</i>

42:48.799 --> 42:49.665
All right.

42:51.100 --> 42:51.767
You ready, hon?

42:51.835 --> 42:52.835
Okay.

43:03.946 --> 43:04.913

43:29.938 --> 43:30.938
They'll find it.

43:31.005 --> 43:33.540
You don't have
to leave, Mom.

43:33.608 --> 43:35.007
If he finds out
I'm seeing you,

43:35.075 --> 43:36.041
God knows
what he'll do!

43:36.109 --> 43:37.910
I'm not a kid any more,
Mom.

43:37.978 --> 43:39.078
I can take care
of myself.

43:39.145 --> 43:40.112
And maybe if you stayed-

43:40.180 --> 43:41.647
you don't have
to protect me.

43:41.715 --> 43:44.249
Let me protect you
for once.

43:44.317 --> 43:45.284
Okay.

43:46.687 --> 43:48.320
If you gotta go,
then you're gonna need this.

43:51.491 --> 43:52.423
Ty, no.

43:52.492 --> 43:54.493
You worked too hard
for this.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.194
I want you
to have this.

43:56.261 --> 43:57.762
If you get settled
and you don't need it,

43:57.830 --> 43:58.797
you can always
send it back,

43:58.865 --> 44:00.665
okay?

44:00.733 --> 44:03.502
I promise you
I will send it back.
