00:05.385 --> 00:07.085
MAN (on video):
No! Aah!

00:07.087 --> 00:09.387
(goon laughing)

00:09.389 --> 00:11.389
Don't move.

00:11.391 --> 00:13.591
Shh.

00:16.628 --> 00:19.363
When your people do business
in my territory,

00:19.365 --> 00:22.633
makes me think
you don't respect me.

00:22.635 --> 00:26.204
It was a mistake, I swear.

00:26.206 --> 00:28.272
Maybe so...

00:28.274 --> 00:31.709
but mistakes have consequences.

00:31.711 --> 00:33.845
No, no! No! No, please!

00:33.847 --> 00:35.913
I'm begging you, no! No!

00:35.915 --> 00:37.548
Talk to the hand.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.350
(screams)

00:39.352 --> 00:42.520
(sighs) Think I'll skip
the ending this time.

00:42.522 --> 00:44.655
I just had breakfast.

00:44.657 --> 00:45.957
My point, exactly, Judge.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.592
Allowing the jury
to see this video

00:47.594 --> 00:49.060
would be grossly
prejudicial.

00:49.062 --> 00:50.561
I agree with the gross part.

00:50.563 --> 00:53.598
Maybe your client should stop
torturing the competition.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.901
It is exceedingly graphic
and disturbing, Counselor.

00:56.903 --> 00:58.669
Well, they don't call her
the Lioness for nothing.

00:58.671 --> 01:01.005
Ms. Chao is the most dangerous
human trafficker in New York.

01:01.007 --> 01:02.173
Allegedly.

01:02.175 --> 01:04.675
She smuggles desperate
immigrants into the country

01:04.677 --> 01:06.911
and then sells them
into sex slavery.

01:06.913 --> 01:08.713
We're all aware of the charges,
Ms. Reagan.

01:08.715 --> 01:11.315
Which includes assault
in the first degree,

01:11.317 --> 01:13.885
which this tape depicts
in spades.

01:13.887 --> 01:15.386
My client can not get
a fair trial

01:15.388 --> 01:17.388
if this tape is admitted,
Your Honor.

01:17.390 --> 01:19.223
The authenticity of this tape
is not in dispute,

01:19.225 --> 01:21.392
and its probative value
is obvious.

01:21.394 --> 01:23.161
I am concerned about
the sensational nature

01:23.163 --> 01:24.796
of the video.
Thank you.

01:24.798 --> 01:27.331
It speaks directly
to the heinous nature

01:27.333 --> 01:29.767
of the alleged crime,
Your Honor.

01:29.769 --> 01:31.569
And while potentially
prejudicial,

01:31.571 --> 01:34.138
its probative value
is undeniable.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.108
I'm gonna allow it
into evidence.

01:37.976 --> 01:39.477
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:39.479 --> 01:42.280
Due respect, Your Honor,
this is totally unfair.

01:42.282 --> 01:43.848
I'm sure the
one-handed gentleman

01:43.850 --> 01:46.484
in the video
felt the same way.

01:50.222 --> 01:52.456
FRANK: Excuse me.
Are you listening?

01:52.458 --> 01:54.058
I asked you to set up
a press conference.

01:54.096 --> 01:54.695
I heard.

01:54.707 --> 01:56.161
I would have thought
he'd be thrilled.

01:56.162 --> 01:57.995
Seeing as you spend
half your days

01:57.997 --> 01:59.297
trying to push him in there.

01:59.299 --> 02:00.431
And normally, I would be.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.365
Normally?

02:01.367 --> 02:02.867
I think we should take a beat.

02:02.869 --> 02:04.435
Oh, I see what he's doing.

02:04.437 --> 02:06.404
Who you got him on?
One of the morning shows?

02:06.406 --> 02:07.839
GARRETT: No.
- <i>Charlie Rose?</i>

02:07.841 --> 02:10.041
<i>Charlie Rose</i> would be a great
platform to roll this out.

02:10.043 --> 02:11.742
No. Not <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

02:11.744 --> 02:14.846
Not anybody.
You're sitting on something.

02:15.981 --> 02:19.550
The acting mayor,
she opposes the plan.

02:24.823 --> 02:28.659
Oh, come on, Garrett.
It's a gift to her.

02:28.661 --> 02:30.027
Apparently, she doesn't
see it that way.

02:30.029 --> 02:31.863
In what way does she see it?

02:31.865 --> 02:33.130
She thinks the cost of
retraining officers

02:33.132 --> 02:34.332
is prohibitive.

02:34.334 --> 02:35.800
Oh, please.
GORMLEY: How the hell would she know?

02:35.802 --> 02:39.036
Dutton was a dog catcher
till 15 minutes ago.

02:39.038 --> 02:41.472
Public advocate,
and she believes the program

02:41.474 --> 02:43.541
prioritizes targeting
street crime...

02:43.543 --> 02:45.209
And when's the last time
somebody got mugged

02:45.211 --> 02:46.777
on the street by Bernie Madoff?

02:46.779 --> 02:49.480
She's missing the whole point.

02:49.482 --> 02:53.150
We should cancel your morning
and schedule a face-to-face...

02:53.152 --> 02:56.487
I already sold that
and she's not buying.

like to discuss

03:08.201 --> 03:09.700
a plea in this matter.

03:09.702 --> 03:11.168
Imagine my surprise.

03:11.170 --> 03:13.170
Despite the judge's
unfortunate ruling,

03:13.172 --> 03:15.039
we still feel we
can prevail at trial.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.941
Yeah. Good luck with that.
That said,

03:16.943 --> 03:19.176
should a reasonable
plea arrangement...

03:19.178 --> 03:21.279
25 to life,
parole after 20.

03:21.281 --> 03:22.713
I believe

03:22.715 --> 03:24.482
I said "reasonable""
We have your client

03:24.484 --> 03:28.052
on felony sex trafficking
and compelling prostitution.

03:28.054 --> 03:30.054
And don't forget the hand thing.
ERIN: Right.

03:30.056 --> 03:32.089
The amputation video,
that puts the jury in my pocket.

03:32.091 --> 03:35.393
See, if Ms. Chao is
convicted on all charges,

03:35.395 --> 03:37.662
and the sentences run
consecutively,

03:37.664 --> 03:40.431
Ms. Chao will be an
extremely old sex trafficker

03:40.433 --> 03:42.266
by the time she gets out.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.972
12 years, parole after five.

03:47.974 --> 03:49.407
25, take it or leave it.

03:49.409 --> 03:52.510
I admire your strength.

03:52.512 --> 03:54.078
My competitors

03:54.080 --> 03:56.681
try to take advantage of
me because I'm a woman.

03:56.683 --> 03:58.416
They think it makes me weak.

03:58.418 --> 04:02.453
The female empowerment angle
would be a lot more compelling

04:02.455 --> 04:05.656
if you weren't selling girls
into sex slavery.

04:06.858 --> 04:10.361
You know, many people have tried
to take me down, Ms. Reagan.

04:12.064 --> 04:14.131
They've all lived
to regret it...

04:15.334 --> 04:17.134
...if they lived at all.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.603
It's a crime to threaten

04:19.605 --> 04:21.973
an officer of the court,
Ms. Chao.

04:21.975 --> 04:24.709
Just a little sisterly advice.

04:24.711 --> 04:27.545
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's not get sidetracked.

04:27.547 --> 04:28.713
We're talking
about a deal.

04:28.715 --> 04:29.981
Not anymore we're not.

04:29.983 --> 04:31.916
The offer is
officially rescinded.

04:31.918 --> 04:33.617
I'll see you in court.

What happened?

04:57.310 --> 05:00.144
Well, seems the judge

05:00.146 --> 05:02.446
took a header
off the roof.

05:02.448 --> 05:04.382
(exhales)

05:04.384 --> 05:05.516
On his own?

05:05.518 --> 05:06.817
Don't know yet.

05:06.819 --> 05:08.319
DANNY:
Yeah, who knows? I mean,

05:08.321 --> 05:10.154
maybe it was an accident
to suddenly fell.

05:10.156 --> 05:11.789
It wasn't.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.225
Chao Lin did this
to force a mistrial,

05:14.227 --> 05:16.327

Trajectory of the fall

suicide or accidental fall.

06:24.564 --> 06:26.697
Look, I'm the one that built
the case against Chao Lin.

06:26.699 --> 06:29.200
I know her operation
and all the players.

06:29.202 --> 06:31.235
Maybe he can help, Danny.

06:31.237 --> 06:33.270
No. I've worked with him before,
he's a pain in the ass.

06:33.272 --> 06:34.638
I think you're a pain
in the ass, too.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.908

Good. Whatever.

Where are the cops
in their investigation?

06:53.359 --> 06:56.160
No sign of foul play, but
it's only been a few hours.

06:56.162 --> 06:57.962
Something tells me Chao's lawyer
isn't the patient type.

06:57.964 --> 07:02.299
Already petitioned the chief
judge to declare a mistrial.

07:02.301 --> 07:05.636
And grant his client a new one
with a new judge.

07:05.638 --> 07:09.206
We have been chasing Chao
for over four years.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.842
She's already walked away
from two previous prosecutions.

07:11.844 --> 07:13.744
Judge Tessler's

07:13.746 --> 07:15.780
last ruling finally handed me

07:15.782 --> 07:18.482
the smoking gun I need
to nail her.

07:18.484 --> 07:21.018
And you think a new judge
might reverse that ruling.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.387
I'm not willing
to take that chance.

07:23.389 --> 07:24.922
You may not
have a choice.

07:24.924 --> 07:28.526
Unless Tessler's death can be
linked to Chao and her people,

07:28.528 --> 07:30.494
it's a long shot
to avoid a mistrial.

07:30.496 --> 07:31.729
I agree.

07:31.731 --> 07:33.097
Which is why we need to prove

07:33.099 --> 07:35.733
that Chao is responsible
for Tessler's death.

07:35.735 --> 07:37.201
So what's the game plan?

07:38.503 --> 07:41.539
Stall the chief judge until
we have the evidence we need

07:41.541 --> 07:44.341
to prosecute Chao for murder.
Okay.

07:45.544 --> 07:49.446
But this office relies on
the goodwill of the chief judge.

As long as we can frame
it that the beat cop

09:34.340 --> 09:37.275
is going to know your name

09:37.277 --> 09:38.943
That doesn't sell Mayor Dutton.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.144
Well, when was the last time

09:40.146 --> 09:43.181

09:43.183 --> 09:45.650
And I don't think we need her.

She's got great connections
on all the luxury floors,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.622
where she lives, but if you want
to get this passed,

09:51.624 --> 09:53.891
you need to come down
to the ground floor,

09:53.893 --> 09:57.028
where the city council lives.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.194

And I have the votes you need
to get this passed.

10:03.232 --> 10:04.531
She'll just veto it.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.433
She might, but then,

10:06.435 --> 10:10.637
we just might get all the votes
we need to override that veto.

10:10.639 --> 10:13.540
It's a really good plan, Frank,

10:13.542 --> 10:16.076
and I'm behind you all the way.

10:18.847 --> 10:21.081
(sighs)
(door closes)

10:23.751 --> 10:25.486
You say the judge
came up here all the time?

10:25.488 --> 10:26.887
Especially in
the warm weather.

10:26.889 --> 10:28.222
Liked to work up here.

10:28.224 --> 10:29.890
You see him
the day he died?

10:29.892 --> 10:32.126
No. I was working down
in the basement all day.

10:32.128 --> 10:34.428
Didn't know what happened till
I heard the sirens outside.

10:34.535 --> 10:36.401
Tessler have any enemies
around here?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.637
Not unless you count his wife.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.205
What? They didn't get along?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.407
She's a real piece of work.
Felt bad for the judge.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.943
When those two went at it,
the windows rattled.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.613
All right, thanks for your time.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.517
Sounds like we should
talk to the wife again.

10:51.541 --> 10:51.984
Oh.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.007
You come up with that all
by yourself, did you?

10:54.031 --> 10:54.787
Danny.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.955
- I'm just trying to help, okay?
- Look,

10:56.957 --> 10:59.324
I know the timing of the judge's
death seems suspicious,

10:59.326 --> 11:01.593
but I don't see any signs
of homicide here.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.161
No evidence at the scene,
no eyewitnesses,

11:03.163 --> 11:04.289
no surveillance videos.

11:04.313 --> 11:05.231
And he was in
a lousy marriage.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.499
Plus, taking antidepressants.
You do the math.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.201
Chao's people are smart.

11:09.203 --> 11:10.702
Anybody could have
pulled this off

11:10.704 --> 11:12.371
without leaving fingerprints.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.306
I'm telling you, it's them.

11:14.308 --> 11:16.141
Yeah, I think you're right.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.877
Maybe they floated over in a
blimp, lowered themselves down,

11:18.879 --> 11:21.680
threw the judge over the side of
the building, shimmied back up

11:21.682 --> 11:23.014
the rope, and floated away

11:23.016 --> 11:24.649
into the sunset back
to Chinatown, is that it?

11:24.651 --> 11:26.651
Keep running that mouth,
you're gonna go off the side

11:26.653 --> 11:28.138
of the roof the
same way the judge...

11:28.162 --> 11:29.122
I'm standing right here!

11:29.123 --> 11:30.181
You got a big mouth,
and you don't shut up!

11:30.205 --> 11:31.124
Come on! Hey!

11:31.125 --> 11:33.091
We have a case to work!

11:34.227 --> 11:36.528
Case of suicide.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.534
He's had a rough few months.

11:42.536 --> 11:46.138
Yeah, but he was a prick
way before that.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.506
(sighs)

11:56.015 --> 11:57.616
Sorry to interrupt.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.651
Oh, trust me,
this guy won't mind.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.319
Drank himself to death.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.921
Just look at this liver.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.702
Oh, I'll pass. Thanks.

12:03.726 --> 12:05.525
You didn't have to come
all the way down here, Erin.

12:05.526 --> 12:07.125
I could have filled you
in over the phone.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.493
I was in the neighborhood.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.695
Besides, it's been a while
since I've been in the pit.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.164
Well, it is glamorous.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.900
How long till
you put in your papers, Craig?

12:14.902 --> 12:18.670
I got seven months, 18 days,
and... oh, five hours.

12:18.672 --> 12:19.938
Well, you'll be missed.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.873
You're one of the best.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.575
It's too bad about Judge
Tessler. He was a good man.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.478
- Any updates on cause of death?
- Well,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.413
there's no trauma
outside of what you'd expect

12:28.415 --> 12:31.249
from the fall, and cops didn't
find any evidence of foul play.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.018
- Yet.
- Preliminary tests

12:33.020 --> 12:35.520
show that there is
antidepressants in his system,

12:35.522 --> 12:38.490
which correlates
for suicidal ideation.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.392
But not definitively?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.694
You're not trying to push me

12:42.696 --> 12:44.663
towards a homicide ruling,
are you?

12:44.665 --> 12:47.632
Absolutely not,
but it is a high-profile case,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.668
sitting judge and all.
Lot of eyeballs

12:49.670 --> 12:51.570
on this one.
If I was

12:51.572 --> 12:53.405
seven months, 18 days

12:53.407 --> 12:54.539
and five hours away

12:54.541 --> 12:56.107
from my pension,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.043
I'd want to get this one right.

13:15.626 --> 13:18.194
Ms. Chao, Detective Reagan.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.565
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.501
You sure you don't want
your attorney present for this?

13:24.503 --> 13:26.503
I have nothing to hide.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.504
DANNY:
Nice break for you,

13:27.506 --> 13:29.172
the judge buying it
the way he did.

13:29.174 --> 13:31.107
Must have been
a very troubled man.

13:31.109 --> 13:32.309
We have records

13:32.311 --> 13:34.411
of all your phone
calls and visits since

13:34.413 --> 13:36.279
you've been on the inside.
If you gave the order

13:36.281 --> 13:37.581
to whack the judge,

13:37.583 --> 13:39.082
we'll find out.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.918
If you have everything
you need, Detectives,

13:41.920 --> 13:43.253
why are you here?

13:43.255 --> 13:45.288
Well, we thought that we
would help you help yourself.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.991
See, if you did order
the hit on the judge,

13:47.993 --> 13:50.226
well, that's life in
prison without parole.

13:50.228 --> 13:52.028
You could make that
time easy on yourself,

13:52.030 --> 13:54.798
or you could make it hard
on yourself.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.299
Oh, I see.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.501
So, if I confess,

13:58.503 --> 14:02.072
you'll get me a nice little cell
out in the country

14:02.074 --> 14:04.307
with lace curtains
and a pretty view?

14:04.309 --> 14:06.576
You're very sure of yourself.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.311
But I wouldn't be too sure.

14:08.313 --> 14:11.848
I was in custody
when the judge dropped dead.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.216
So to speak.

14:13.218 --> 14:15.385
I'm afraid I can't help you.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.820
Okay.

14:21.392 --> 14:23.393
You said your name is Reagan?

14:23.395 --> 14:24.527
Yup.

14:24.529 --> 14:26.863
Just like the D.A.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.132
What an upstanding family.

14:29.134 --> 14:32.135
You must be so proud.

14:42.246 --> 14:46.349
Well, this is one hell
of a mess, Counselors.

14:46.351 --> 14:47.417
Yes, ma'am.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.585
I've read your motion

14:48.587 --> 14:50.020
for a new trial, Mr. Skolnick.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.656
It seemed the only option in
light of the current disruption.

14:52.658 --> 14:57.060
That disruption was one
of my finest jurists

14:57.062 --> 14:59.896
and a dear friend
for over 25 years.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.132
It is a tragedy.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.034
ERIN: Which your client
had means and motive

15:04.036 --> 15:05.235
to cause.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.337
There is zero evidence
that this was a homicide,

15:07.339 --> 15:10.173
and the judge-- rest in peace--
was on antidepressants.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.543
So am I, along with half
the population of New York City.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.878
My client is

15:14.880 --> 15:15.945
languishing in jail, Your Honor,

15:15.947 --> 15:18.048
and she has a right
to a speedy trial.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.216
The M.E. has classified
Tessler's cause of death

15:20.218 --> 15:23.586
as undetermined pending
police investigation.

15:23.588 --> 15:26.056
- And that investigation is ongoing.
- Yes.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.759
But Mr. Skolnick's
due process concerns have merit.

15:30.628 --> 15:31.961
So here's the deal.

15:31.963 --> 15:34.898
I'll need a couple of days
to review the case.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.868
When I'm done I'll rule
on Mr. Skolnick's motion

15:38.870 --> 15:41.771
whether or not a cause of death
has been established.

15:50.047 --> 15:52.782
Can I ask you something, boss?
Not to be out of line...

15:52.784 --> 15:54.784
Just ask it.
This is good news.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.886
Thomas says
she can get the votes

15:56.888 --> 15:59.022
behind a program
that means a lot to you.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.156
This is a legacy program.

16:00.158 --> 16:01.658
There a question in there, Sid?

16:01.660 --> 16:05.061
Well, how good does news
have to be for you

16:05.063 --> 16:07.330
for you to look like
you got good news?

16:07.332 --> 16:09.065
That's a good question.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.067
Wish I had a good answer.

16:11.069 --> 16:12.669
GARRETT:
Well,

16:12.671 --> 16:14.304
you called it.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.739
How far along?

16:15.741 --> 16:16.973
She's hired staff,

16:16.975 --> 16:19.191
and has some ongoing
discreet fund-raising.

16:19.192 --> 16:19.878
This is?

16:19.902 --> 16:21.802
Regina Thomas.
May be running for mayor.

16:21.816 --> 16:22.761
No maybe.

16:22.785 --> 16:25.081
So what?! She still wants
to back the plan, right?

16:25.684 --> 16:27.317
It's still the same good news.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.752
That's exactly right, Sid.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.855
That doesn't complicate it
to you?

16:31.857 --> 16:33.156
Only if you're bucking
for sainthood,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.191
but if you're trying to get
your program funded, no.

16:35.193 --> 16:37.393
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

16:37.395 --> 16:38.962
That's the difference
between you and everybody.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.063
What's that mean?

16:40.065 --> 16:41.297
That none of the million people

16:41.299 --> 16:43.600
who'd benefit from this program
would give a rat's ass

16:43.602 --> 16:45.335
how you got the money for it.

16:46.337 --> 16:49.038
You could be right.
- Thank you.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.509
But how could you leverage
you being right?

17:00.651 --> 17:03.453
Still the best damn brisket
sandwich in town.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.288
Especially
when you pick up the tab.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.656
You're welcome.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.625
And just what are you trying
to buy with it?

17:08.627 --> 17:11.795
Community policing is
very important to my boss.

17:11.797 --> 17:14.763
Mine, too, but she thinks
the new plan goes too far.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.233
Look, this is still a new
relationship, our bosses.

17:17.234 --> 17:19.469
Let's at least try to keep
this thing functional.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.404
Couldn't agree more.
Would you pass the pickles?

17:21.406 --> 17:26.209
Mm. If the mayor blinks
so early in her term,

17:26.211 --> 17:28.278
she'll look weak.
Or prudent for

17:28.280 --> 17:29.913
accepting the guidance
of her extremely popular

17:29.915 --> 17:32.215
and effective P.C.
- Sorry.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.251
Garrett, no can do.
The timing is wrong.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.922
I have it
from a very credible source

17:38.924 --> 17:43.193
that Speaker Thomas likes
the P.C.'s plan... a lot.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.961
Let me guess.

17:44.963 --> 17:49.165
Regina invited Frank
to a little veto-override party?

17:49.167 --> 17:52.602
I cannot confirm or deny.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.237
She's an opportunist
who would sell her own mother

17:54.239 --> 17:55.505
to get what she wants.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.440
Which, in this case,
is enhanced community policing.

17:57.442 --> 17:59.075
Regina couldn't give a rat's ass

17:59.077 --> 18:01.244
about cops playing patty-cake
with the locals.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.545
She wants to be mayor.

18:02.547 --> 18:05.782
And the P.C. wants this thing
passed anyway, anyhow.

18:05.784 --> 18:06.950
Even getting used

18:06.952 --> 18:08.718
to hand the acting mayor
a public defeat? Eh, no.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.720
I know him.
- I thought I did, too.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.623
He doesn't care how
this cake gets baked.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.725
He just wants to serve it up.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.961
I'm not kidding.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.435
Hey, how'd it go
with Tessler's wife?

18:25.437 --> 18:26.936
Well, the super was right

18:26.938 --> 18:28.104
about the judge's wife.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.607
She's a battle-ax,
but she's got a solid alibi,

18:30.609 --> 18:31.574
so that's that.

18:31.576 --> 18:33.509
Well, Erin bought us
a couple of days

18:33.511 --> 18:34.844
with the chief judge.
- Good.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.179
Though I'm not sure
what good it'll do.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.882
We still got nothing says
this was a homicide.

18:38.884 --> 18:40.149
Are you guys throwing in
the towel?

18:40.151 --> 18:41.784
That's not what she said.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.152
But if we're gonna find out
who killed the judge,

18:43.154 --> 18:45.288
we're gonna need
an eyewitness to the crime.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.589
Where the hell are we
supposed to find one?

18:46.591 --> 18:47.957
My guess,

18:47.959 --> 18:50.293
amongst the many windows looking
down at the judge's rooftop.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.662
That's a lot of damn windows.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.330
Well, unless you got
a better idea,

18:54.332 --> 18:56.065
I suggest we round up
some uniforms

18:56.067 --> 18:58.968
and get to knocking on doors--
that's if you can keep up.

19:05.109 --> 19:06.743
- We've been at it for hours.
- Yeah.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.544
And nobody's heard
or seen a damn thing.

19:08.546 --> 19:10.146
Erin wants to
pin this on Chao,

19:10.148 --> 19:12.315
but you can't turn this
into something it's not.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.850
Excuse me,

19:13.852 --> 19:15.985
miss... police.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.388
You mind if we ask you
a few questions?

19:18.390 --> 19:19.923
About the judge who died?

19:19.925 --> 19:22.492
Yeah, you know anything
about that?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.493
Sorry, I didn't see anything.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.460
Do you live here?

19:24.462 --> 19:25.595
Yeah.
Do you have a view

19:25.597 --> 19:27.397
out to the judge's rooftop?

19:27.399 --> 19:29.132
Yes. I saw the judge sitting
out there pretty often.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.767
What about the day
he died?

19:30.769 --> 19:32.435
Yeah, but I didn't see
what happened.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.437
He was just sitting out there
reading papers, like always.

19:34.439 --> 19:37.040
And you didn't see anyone else
out there on the roof?

19:37.042 --> 19:38.641
No, just the judge and
the building superintendent.

19:38.643 --> 19:42.245
The super...

19:42.247 --> 19:43.947
was out on the
roof as well?

19:43.949 --> 19:46.182
Yeah, Joe...

19:46.184 --> 19:47.417
Joe Wheeler?

19:47.419 --> 19:49.052
Yeah. Nice guy.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.386
Jump-started my car last winter.

19:50.388 --> 19:52.288
DANNY:
Uh-huh, that sounds like Joe.

19:52.290 --> 19:55.024
Okay, well, uh,
thank you for your time.

19:59.596 --> 20:01.931
The roof's a long way
from the basement.

20:01.933 --> 20:06.002
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.271
Why'd you lie
to us, Joe?

20:08.273 --> 20:09.639
I forgot.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.074
You forgot?
- I went up to the roof

20:11.076 --> 20:13.109
for a few minutes
to check some wiring.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.510
It was an honest mistake.

20:14.512 --> 20:15.845
An honest mistake?

20:15.847 --> 20:18.648
No, forgetting your keys,
that's an honest mistake.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.350
Homicide is not.

20:20.352 --> 20:23.152
I didn't kill Judge Tessler.
Well, we got

20:23.154 --> 20:26.322
an eyewitness says they saw you
throw him off the roof.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.326
I thought the neighbor said
she didn't see what happened.

20:30.328 --> 20:33.096
She did, but he
doesn't know that.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.697
(exhales)

20:36.000 --> 20:37.767
So, what?

20:37.769 --> 20:40.203
You're gonna
come clean now, Joe?

20:42.806 --> 20:45.274
(crying quietly, sniffling)

20:46.677 --> 20:49.012
He was trying to get me fired.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.581
The judge was trying
to get you fired? Why?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.500
He said I was stealing
petty cash from the building.

20:53.511 --> 20:55.324
Were you?

20:56.954 --> 20:59.255
I was gonna pay it back.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.356
My kid needed braces.

21:00.358 --> 21:02.892
Why would you kill a guy
over a few bucks?

21:04.928 --> 21:07.030
It was an accident.

21:08.365 --> 21:11.401
I went up there to work it out
with him; we got in an argument.

21:11.403 --> 21:15.238
Oh. Thought you went up there
to fix some wires.

21:16.707 --> 21:18.941
I guess I pushed him.

21:18.943 --> 21:20.209
You guess?

21:21.478 --> 21:24.947
I swear, Detective,
I didn't mean to kill him.

21:24.949 --> 21:27.450
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't.

21:30.154 --> 21:31.921

You're hiring campaign staff,
you're raising money.

Just because I'm thinking about

You bring home a steak,

you're sure as hell

I am backing your plan

They'll probably be sitting outside my

22:50.412 --> 22:52.212
and torches.
- Oh, please.

22:52.214 --> 22:54.381
Because the reality is,
nobody in that neighborhood

22:54.383 --> 22:56.850
wants more cops
in their business.

22:56.852 --> 22:57.784
The smart ones would.

23:04.359 --> 23:07.160
They're not there
anymore, Frank.

23:07.162 --> 23:09.896
The only ones left
are the real ones,

23:09.898 --> 23:13.299
and they don't think
of your cops as heroes.

I'm trying to help here,

Yes, I do.
- Okay.

23:32.421 --> 23:34.421
You're trying
to do something good.

23:34.423 --> 23:36.089
I'm trying to help.

23:36.091 --> 23:38.992
You're trying to stay

24:02.417 --> 24:03.077
Help with what?

24:03.101 --> 24:04.885
The added benefit
of an hourly update.

24:04.886 --> 24:06.920
- Exactly.
- HENRY: Come on, guys.

24:06.922 --> 24:09.656
She thought her defendant
had killed a sitting judge.

24:09.658 --> 24:11.591
I'd want all hands
on deck, too.

24:11.593 --> 24:12.197
Thank you, Pop.

Especially when you're dealing
with a monster like her.

JAMIE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How could she be a monster
if she hasn't been convicted

24:17.632 --> 24:18.998
of a monstrous crime?
FRANK: Right.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.099
Which she hasn't yet, right?

24:20.101 --> 24:21.501
Walks like a duck...

24:21.503 --> 24:22.669
"Alleged monster," okay?

24:22.671 --> 24:23.470
Okay.

24:23.472 --> 24:24.704
Okay, but how do you make

24:24.706 --> 24:27.574
that call on yourself?
What call?

24:27.576 --> 24:29.709
Whether some personal
investment is interfering

24:29.711 --> 24:31.744
with following protocol.

24:31.746 --> 24:35.114
I didn't cross a line,
if that's what you're saying.

24:35.116 --> 24:38.918
I hear things-- you went
to the M.E. to discuss the cause of death.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.753
I was checking in on the status

24:40.755 --> 24:42.355
of a case.
DANNY: Checking in on

24:42.357 --> 24:44.123
or leaning on?

24:44.125 --> 24:46.292
Checking in.
Right.

24:46.294 --> 24:49.195
What's going on here,
an inquisition?

24:49.197 --> 24:51.464
Has no one at this table
leaned in hard

24:51.466 --> 24:53.032
on something
that mattered to them?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.535
There is a difference, and I
think everyone here knows that.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.570
Yeah, including me.

24:57.572 --> 24:59.405
But sometimes the ends
justify the means?

24:59.407 --> 25:01.307
Don't look so surprised.

25:01.309 --> 25:03.343
I'm not surprised--
I'm sure there's been a time

25:03.345 --> 25:05.812
where you had to make the end
justify the means.

25:05.814 --> 25:07.013
What about you, Jamie?

25:07.015 --> 25:09.415
Let's just say some things
I regretted at the time,

25:09.417 --> 25:11.251

25:11.253 --> 25:14.053
Wow. Once a lawyer,
always a lawyer.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.555
Yeah? And how
about you, Gramps?

an end to income inequality.

How about you?

If there was a probability

25:33.909 --> 25:36.276
that doing
the so-called "right thing"

25:36.278 --> 25:38.545
might jeopardize
the safety of the public

25:38.547 --> 25:41.180
or my officers,
I think I could...

25:41.182 --> 25:44.183
come around to justifying
the means to the end.

25:44.185 --> 25:46.719
At any cost to you?

25:47.721 --> 25:50.290
I don't think
you can make that measurement

I was nine years old,

26:24.225 --> 26:25.758
when you stole my baseball cards

26:25.760 --> 26:26.859

who had been sold
into prostitution by Chao

26:37.272 --> 26:39.205
when she was 13.

26:41.008 --> 26:43.610
Thirteen.

of other girls like her,

26:46.581 --> 26:48.414

26:56.124 --> 26:58.524
I was sure
that Chao had done it.

Don't beat yourself up.
Tessler dying

27:00.228 --> 27:01.995
exactly when it's most
convenient to Chao,

27:01.997 --> 27:04.464
who has no issue threatening
public officials.

27:04.466 --> 27:07.200
Chao threatened Judge Tessler?

27:18.246 --> 27:20.513
The second time was
the other night.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.281
So you were threatened
more than once--

27:22.283 --> 27:23.523
is that what you're telling me?

27:24.485 --> 27:25.551
What happened?

27:25.553 --> 27:27.787
They followed me.

27:27.789 --> 27:29.922
Left Chao's calling card
on my windshield.

27:29.924 --> 27:31.524
And you didn't think to tell me?

27:31.526 --> 27:33.526
They're just trying to scare me
off the case, Danny.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.128
Did you at least tell
the court officer

27:35.130 --> 27:36.129
in your building?

27:36.131 --> 27:37.997
No, you didn't,

27:37.999 --> 27:40.667
because you didn't want
to be removed from the case.

27:40.669 --> 27:41.901
When did this happen?

27:41.903 --> 27:43.803
Thursday night.

27:43.805 --> 27:44.937
Thursday night?

27:44.939 --> 27:47.407
Thursday night is when
we brought Wheeler in

27:47.409 --> 27:48.908
for questioning.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.576
And Chao's people had
to know about that.

27:50.578 --> 27:51.611
So?

27:51.613 --> 27:53.413
So why would they risk
threatening you

27:53.415 --> 27:55.381
if Wheeler already confessed

27:55.383 --> 27:57.450
and Chao was in the clear?

27:57.452 --> 27:59.752
Because they didn't know
what Wheeler had told you.

27:59.754 --> 28:01.821
Yeah, because they had
something to hide

28:01.823 --> 28:03.790
about the judge's death.

28:07.761 --> 28:09.262
The ruling on the motion
for mistrial

28:09.264 --> 28:10.963

tomorrow morning.

28:10.965 --> 28:12.098
Well, you better stall it,

28:12.100 --> 28:13.700

28:18.872 --> 28:21.174
You got to try one
of these, boss.

28:21.176 --> 28:23.176

in the blanket.

Be quicker sticking your gun
in your mouth.

28:25.013 --> 28:26.713
(chuckles)
- You get the ones with the bacon?

28:26.715 --> 28:28.748
(mouth full):
What do you think?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.583
Miller floated a deal
from the mayor.

28:30.585 --> 28:31.884
And it floats?

28:31.886 --> 28:34.520
You agree to back away
from community policing.

28:34.522 --> 28:36.689
If/when Dutton wins
a special election,

28:36.691 --> 28:38.825
you stay on as P.C.

28:38.827 --> 28:40.526
If you shoot your puppy,

28:40.528 --> 28:42.395
then you can still
live in the house.

28:42.397 --> 28:43.896
Kinda.

28:43.898 --> 28:45.064
That's a deal?

28:45.066 --> 28:47.433
Speaker Thomas is our friend
in this.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.268
And, no, I never thought
I'd say that.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.604
Dutton knows the
speaker supports?

28:51.606 --> 28:53.372
- Yes.
- And she still throws this at us?

28:53.374 --> 28:54.273
Yes.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.075
If anything,
Thomas on your side

28:56.077 --> 28:57.276
made the mayor stand firmer.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.245
So it's Thomas or bust.
Looks that way.

28:59.247 --> 29:00.947
Got to hold your nose.

29:03.183 --> 29:06.419
Maybe I'd better have
one of those.

29:09.256 --> 29:10.957
DANNY: Why was Chao's gang
so worried about

29:10.959 --> 29:12.125
what you were
gonna tell us, Joe?

29:12.127 --> 29:13.326
I have no idea.
- Really?

29:13.328 --> 29:14.660
So you admit

29:14.662 --> 29:16.295
you know about Chao Lin?

29:16.297 --> 29:18.798
No, I mean, I read the papers.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.701
Huh. Yeah, well,
you know what I read?

29:21.703 --> 29:22.902
I read people.

29:22.904 --> 29:24.670
And I find it
really interesting

29:24.672 --> 29:26.139
that you had no criminal record,

29:26.141 --> 29:28.374
yet suddenly your job is
threatened, and you flip

29:28.376 --> 29:29.709
and throw a guy
off a roof.

29:29.711 --> 29:31.344
I told you, it was an accident.

29:31.346 --> 29:32.545
You told us.

29:34.014 --> 29:35.815
You know, on our job,
we work with

29:35.817 --> 29:37.216
some really bad people.

29:37.218 --> 29:38.251
Real hard cases

29:38.253 --> 29:40.853
who like to hurt people
for no reason

29:40.855 --> 29:43.256
and don't give a damn
about it when they do.

29:43.258 --> 29:44.423
But it's funny,

29:44.425 --> 29:46.626
I don't think that's the
type of guy that you are.

29:46.628 --> 29:49.862
We need to know what
really happened, Joe.

29:49.864 --> 29:53.199
Look, you guys don't understand.

29:53.201 --> 29:54.567
I've got a family.

29:54.569 --> 29:57.170
Oh, they got to you, is that it?

29:57.172 --> 30:00.239
They knew you had access to
the building and to the judge,

30:00.241 --> 30:01.407
so what happened?

30:01.409 --> 30:02.675
They offer to pay you,

30:02.677 --> 30:04.010
or did they threaten you?

30:04.012 --> 30:05.711
(exhales)
They threaten you

30:05.713 --> 30:07.146
and your family, Joe?
Is that it?

30:08.115 --> 30:10.283
That's it.
They threatened you.

30:11.451 --> 30:13.853
Yeah.
- (shuddering)

30:13.855 --> 30:17.290
These guys are animals.

30:17.292 --> 30:20.326
They will kill my wife
and my kids.

30:20.328 --> 30:23.062
We can help you,
but you got to work with us.

30:23.064 --> 30:24.764
And then we'll work
with the D.A.

30:24.766 --> 30:26.199
and get you a deal.

30:26.201 --> 30:28.367
This can turn out okay for you.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.503
You don't know these people.

30:31.839 --> 30:33.272
I am doing

30:33.274 --> 30:34.974
what I have to do,

30:34.976 --> 30:38.044
and I have got nothing else
to say.

30:55.344 --> 30:56.844
We just need a little
more time, Your Honor.

30:56.846 --> 30:59.079
The People
are stalling, Judge.

30:59.081 --> 31:01.782
I was very clear on
the timetable here, Counselor.

31:01.784 --> 31:02.750
I know.

31:02.752 --> 31:04.151
But we've been advised
by the police.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.686
They have a new lead
in this case.

31:05.688 --> 31:07.788
Care to share
with the rest of us?

31:07.790 --> 31:09.857
So you can share it
with your homicidal client?

31:09.859 --> 31:10.925
Not likely.

31:10.927 --> 31:12.426
We just need one more day
before you rule

31:12.428 --> 31:14.461
on this mistrial, Your Honor.

31:20.001 --> 31:22.536
You've got two hours.

31:24.272 --> 31:26.073
DANNY:
<i>Two hours?</i>

31:26.075 --> 31:27.408
That's it?

31:27.410 --> 31:30.010
That's cutting it pretty close,
don't you think?

31:30.779 --> 31:33.113
(sighs)
Okay. Fine.

31:33.115 --> 31:35.015
Yeah, I got it.

31:35.017 --> 31:37.184
Judge gave Erin two hours.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.719
Yeah. I put that together.

31:39.554 --> 31:41.021
This Jaw Long, you...

31:41.023 --> 31:42.756
you sure he's the
right guy to go see?

31:42.758 --> 31:44.024
He's Chao's number two.

31:44.026 --> 31:47.228
He's been running the gang
since Chao got pinched.

31:47.230 --> 31:48.230
Good.

31:50.432 --> 31:52.666
Look, I...

31:52.668 --> 31:54.702
know I've been a little
bit of a hard-ass...

31:54.704 --> 31:56.664
You've been a total hump.
That's what you've been.

31:58.540 --> 32:01.342
I'm just not used to having
a babysitter, okay?

32:01.344 --> 32:03.444
Yeah, well, you've been acting
like you need one.

32:03.446 --> 32:05.746
(sighs)

32:05.748 --> 32:10.084
Look, uh, me riding shotgun

32:10.086 --> 32:12.419
wasn't my call.

32:12.421 --> 32:13.721
Talk to your sister.

32:13.723 --> 32:14.989
Yeah, that's easier said
than done.

32:14.991 --> 32:17.591
Tell me about it.

32:44.019 --> 32:45.586
Thanks for meeting us.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.146
I always cooperate
with law enforcement.

32:47.147 --> 32:47.586
DANNY: Good.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.990
We're on the clock,
so let's cut to the chase.

32:49.992 --> 32:52.459
We know your guys
muscled Joe Wheeler

32:52.461 --> 32:53.414
into killing the judge.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.729
If you know that,
you should arrest me.

32:54.730 --> 32:56.397
Wheeler's too scared
to rat you out.

32:56.399 --> 32:57.431
Smart guy.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.799
DANNY:
Speaking of smart,

32:58.801 --> 32:59.800
we understand
you're getting tired

32:59.802 --> 33:01.368
of playing second fiddle
to Chao Lin,

33:01.370 --> 33:04.505
seeing as you're the real
brains of the operation here.

33:04.507 --> 33:07.775
Chao goes away,
makes your promotion permanent.

33:07.777 --> 33:12.646
You've been trying to put
the Lioness in a cage for years.

33:12.648 --> 33:13.981
She's too smart for you.

33:13.983 --> 33:16.283
Or maybe she's just
too smart for you.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.752
After all, she's still
the boss and you're not.

33:18.754 --> 33:22.756
But you guarantee the safety
of Joe Wheeler and his family

33:22.758 --> 33:25.993
if he testifies against Chao
Lin, then she goes bye-bye

33:25.995 --> 33:27.962
and now you're the boss.

33:30.098 --> 33:32.466
And what do you think
will happen to me

33:32.468 --> 33:34.201
if I help you take down Chao?

33:34.203 --> 33:36.370
No one would ever know.
You would know.

33:36.372 --> 33:37.805
And like Chao always says,

33:37.807 --> 33:40.874
never trust a cop.

33:42.177 --> 33:44.111
Look, we're running
out of time here.

33:44.113 --> 33:45.779
And I'm not making a deal
with you guys.

33:45.781 --> 33:47.715
Why are you so loyal
to Chao anyway?

33:47.717 --> 33:49.350
Remember what happened
to Mr. Yi?

33:49.352 --> 33:50.351
Who's Mr. Yi?

33:50.353 --> 33:52.119
That was Chao's last
number two guy.

33:52.121 --> 33:55.155
They found his head
on the West Side Highway.

33:55.157 --> 33:57.291
I remember that.
Poor Mr. Yi.

33:57.293 --> 34:00.127
Because he was being disloyal,
like you're asking me to be.

34:00.129 --> 34:01.495
DANNY: I'm sure
Chao Lin would find

34:01.497 --> 34:03.931
you even talking to us right now
to be disloyal.

34:03.933 --> 34:05.265
But then again,
you're not exactly

34:05.267 --> 34:06.600
a man of principle, are you?

34:06.602 --> 34:08.869
After all, you turn young girls
into hookers for a living.

34:08.871 --> 34:11.071
And cops lie for a living.

34:11.072 --> 34:13.107
Some.

34:17.178 --> 34:20.748
If I let Wheeler testify,
how do I know

34:20.750 --> 34:22.882
you won't come after me
for having a judge killed?

34:22.885 --> 34:24.217
I can tell you for a fact that

34:24.219 --> 34:26.453
the D.A. will not come
after you for the judge.

34:27.722 --> 34:29.422
And I promise you this cop

34:29.425 --> 34:31.592
does not lie.

34:33.228 --> 34:35.195
This is your shot to take over.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.498
DANNY: That is, if
you have the brains

34:37.500 --> 34:39.800
and the balls to take it.

34:42.737 --> 34:45.806
MONICA: You did everything
you could, Erin.

34:45.808 --> 34:47.775
Too bad it wasn't enough.

34:47.777 --> 34:48.909
Under the circumstances,

34:48.911 --> 34:53.213
it was a stretch
to deny Chao a mistrial.

34:53.215 --> 34:55.114
The circumstances
are exactly why

34:55.117 --> 34:56.183
she shouldn't have gotten one.

34:56.185 --> 34:59.486
Look, the facts haven't changed.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.056
There's no reason she won't be
convicted in the new trial.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.659
All the key rulings went our way
the last time.

35:05.661 --> 35:08.362
With a new judge,
it's a crapshoot.

35:08.364 --> 35:10.931
With a high-profile defendant,
it's always a crapshoot.

35:10.933 --> 35:12.533
If I have to work 24/7,

35:12.535 --> 35:14.468
this defendant
is not walking away.

35:14.470 --> 35:15.569
Hopefully not.

35:15.571 --> 35:19.006
But I'm afraid you won't be
the prosecutor.

35:19.008 --> 35:20.441
What are you talking about?

35:20.443 --> 35:23.143
I know you were threatened
by Chao's people, Erin.

35:23.145 --> 35:25.612
You should have come to me.

35:27.382 --> 35:30.084
I didn't want to compromise
the case.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.652
Luckily, you didn't.

35:31.654 --> 35:34.521
(sighs)

35:41.663 --> 35:43.397
You ratted me out to Monica.

35:43.399 --> 35:44.832
I did?

35:44.834 --> 35:46.166
That would be me.

35:46.168 --> 35:49.303
And you should've
reported it yourself.

35:49.305 --> 35:50.337
Yup. He's right.

35:50.339 --> 35:52.206
Well, it doesn't matter, anyway.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.540
She took me off the case.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.608
Sorry to hear that.

35:54.610 --> 35:57.044
A new prosecutor
starting from scratch

35:57.046 --> 35:58.579
against a shark like Skolnick...

35:58.581 --> 36:00.581
DANNY:
That's a raw deal, sis.

36:00.583 --> 36:02.516
But on the flip side,
now you get to focus your time

36:02.518 --> 36:04.384
and energy
on prosecuting Chao Lin

36:04.386 --> 36:05.666
for the murder of Judge Tessler.

36:06.488 --> 36:08.489
What the hell is this?

36:08.491 --> 36:10.324
Statement from Joe Wheeler.

36:10.326 --> 36:11.758
DANNY:
Yep.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.994
He admitted that Chao's crew
threatened to kill his family

36:13.996 --> 36:15.329
if he didn't whack the judge.

36:15.331 --> 36:18.465
ABETEMARCO: And the thugs who
muscled Wheeler will testify

36:18.467 --> 36:20.234
that Chao gave the order.

36:20.236 --> 36:23.537
Murder in the first,
aka life without parole.

36:23.539 --> 36:26.840
This is incredible.

36:26.842 --> 36:28.208
How did you guys pull this off?

36:28.210 --> 36:30.878
BOTH:
You don't want to know.

36:33.982 --> 36:36.917
Okay. Looks like
I'm buying drinks.

36:36.919 --> 36:38.252
Sounds good to me.

36:38.254 --> 36:39.486
DANNY:
You two go ahead, uh,

36:39.488 --> 36:42.456
I got to make a stop first.

36:42.458 --> 36:45.092
(Danny clears throat)

36:45.094 --> 36:46.493
Hey, Danny.

36:47.162 --> 36:49.062
Thanks.

37:03.311 --> 37:06.113
You sold me out,
you son of a bitch.

37:06.115 --> 37:07.247
We had a deal.

37:07.249 --> 37:08.615
Yeah, and I
honored the deal.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.384
I promised you
you wouldn't be implicated

37:10.386 --> 37:12.419
in the death of Judge Tessler,
and you weren't.

37:12.421 --> 37:13.453
It's not why you're here.

37:13.455 --> 37:14.588
What the hell is this?
- Oh, that.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.757
Yeah, well, that's because
you're under arrest

37:16.759 --> 37:20.260
for the attempted murder
of the ADA in your boss' case.

37:20.262 --> 37:21.562
You got to be kidding me.

37:21.564 --> 37:23.263
No. In fact,
we got you cold.

37:23.265 --> 37:24.431
Here.

37:28.069 --> 37:29.970
Ah, that doesn't
prove a damn thing.

37:29.972 --> 37:31.438
Now, just keep looking.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.874
Go ahead.

37:35.476 --> 37:37.878
See, that is
the same vehicle

37:37.880 --> 37:40.447
and license plate
40 seconds later.

37:40.449 --> 37:43.283
Oh, and that is you.

37:43.985 --> 37:45.018
Which proves a lot.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.687
We weren't trying
to kill her. Okay?

37:46.689 --> 37:48.055
We were sending a message.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.291
Right, I get it, but something
tells me her fellow prosecutors

37:51.293 --> 37:52.626
aren't gonna
see it that way.

37:52.628 --> 37:53.727
Hey, you set me up!

37:53.729 --> 37:55.495
Hey!

37:55.497 --> 37:56.863
That ADA is my sister.

37:57.699 --> 38:00.434
And when it comes to family,
sorry.

38:00.436 --> 38:02.402
All deals are off.

38:09.043 --> 38:11.178
I am not turning you down.

38:11.180 --> 38:14.214
I am simply passing on the ways
and means we discussed.

38:14.216 --> 38:15.415
What ways and means?

38:15.417 --> 38:17.317
I offered you help to get
money for your program.

38:17.319 --> 38:18.919
Yeah, and I appreciate that.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.487
I do.

38:20.489 --> 38:22.584
You remember civics class
back in the day?

38:22.608 --> 38:23.258
Yeah.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.458
The three branches
of government.

38:24.460 --> 38:25.492
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:25.494 --> 38:27.327
In this city, I'm judicial.

38:27.329 --> 38:29.363
You're legislative.
She's executive.

38:29.365 --> 38:31.698
Are you actually giving me
a civics lesson right now?

38:31.700 --> 38:36.036
Regina, we stood witness
when she was sworn in.

38:36.038 --> 38:40.607
That means you and I agreed to
uphold the duties of our offices

38:40.609 --> 38:43.677
under her administration.

38:43.679 --> 38:46.380
That's what I'm gonna do.

38:53.121 --> 38:57.224
I am going back to City Hall
to see the mayor

38:57.226 --> 39:00.294
to make one more push.

39:04.565 --> 39:08.201
It would be helpful
if you came with me.

39:08.203 --> 39:11.938
Why would I do that?

39:11.940 --> 39:15.742
Because one day
you may well be mayor

39:15.744 --> 39:18.011
and you sure as hell
are gonna want people

39:18.013 --> 39:20.047
to respect your office.

39:20.049 --> 39:22.683
Like karma?

39:22.685 --> 39:25.352
I don't believe in karma.
I'm Catholic.

39:27.422 --> 39:29.790
You coming?

39:32.226 --> 39:34.995
No, Frank.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.330
(sighs)

39:36.332 --> 39:38.799
Enjoy the furniture.
