WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:07.428
Wohh!

00:07.428 --> 00:09.050
Princess!

00:09.050 --> 00:11.512
Wow, you really miss Princess,
don't you?

00:11.512 --> 00:15.186
Why would you just bring that up
out of the blue?

00:15.186 --> 00:16.517
Because you just said...

00:16.517 --> 00:18.559
"Wohh!

00:18.559 --> 00:21.272
Princess!"

00:21.272 --> 00:22.563
I don't think so.

00:22.563 --> 00:23.694
There is no way I...

00:23.694 --> 00:25.276
wohh!

00:25.276 --> 00:26.947
Princess!

00:28.319 --> 00:30.411
I'm really sorry
that Princess's owner

00:30.411 --> 00:32.153
is keeping you guys
apart.

00:32.153 --> 00:33.494
I wish that
I could help,

00:33.494 --> 00:35.416
but Heather and I don't exactly
get along.

00:35.416 --> 00:37.328
It's okay.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.330
I have to accept that
we're never going to be together

00:39.330 --> 00:40.541
and move on.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.872
I can be strong.

00:41.872 --> 00:43.043
I can do it.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.545
Is that Princess?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.046
I miss you!

00:46.046 --> 00:48.259
Stan, you're leaning
a little far.

00:48.259 --> 00:50.511
I think I can see her
next door in her yard.

00:50.511 --> 00:52.973
I just need to
see around that--

00:52.973 --> 00:54.135
Stan!

00:54.135 --> 00:55.726
It's okay!

00:55.726 --> 00:56.937
Ellen broke my fall!

00:56.937 --> 00:58.889
Mom!

00:58.889 --> 01:02.523
It's okay, she's knocked out
so she can't hear me talk.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.125
Glad your mom's
all right.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.416
Better than all right.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.258
Her mild headache
gives her something

01:27.258 --> 01:28.259
to bravely overcome.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.510
She really needed this

01:29.510 --> 01:31.342
since the sympathy
had run dry from her

01:31.342 --> 01:33.053
a-crow-stole-my-mini-muffin
story.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.347
Thanks for getting me
out of the house.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.269
I guess I was kind of
losing it.

01:38.269 --> 01:40.641
Sure. And I'm glad
to be off the computer.

01:40.641 --> 01:42.022
I've been waiting
for more orders

01:42.022 --> 01:43.274
on my fashion website,

01:43.274 --> 01:44.985
but they've kind of
stopped.

01:44.985 --> 01:47.067
I've got to figure out a way
to get people interested

01:47.067 --> 01:48.439
in the clothes
I'm designing again.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.191
I like them.

01:50.191 --> 01:51.942
Of course, I think clothes are
good for people in general.

01:51.942 --> 01:54.195
Without the fur,
you're kind of nasty.

01:56.036 --> 01:57.408
Oh, there's Princess!

01:57.408 --> 01:58.829
How do I look?

01:58.829 --> 02:00.161
Oh, please tell me

02:00.161 --> 02:01.162
I have an attractive stream
of eye goop

02:01.162 --> 02:02.163
draining onto my cheek.

02:04.295 --> 02:05.706
Too bad Heather's with her.

02:05.706 --> 02:07.418
I don't care.
I'm going in.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.712
Princess,
I miss you so much.

02:11.712 --> 02:15.015
You get away from us,
you, yucky butt-sniffer.

02:15.015 --> 02:17.218
Disparage me
all you wish, madam,

02:17.218 --> 02:19.220
but to disparage
the time-honored art

02:19.220 --> 02:21.222
of butt-sniffing
is a step too far.

02:21.222 --> 02:23.143
A step too far, I say.

02:25.266 --> 02:27.438
Hey, you know,
you could be nice.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.069
I am being nice.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.271
And you might be
able to see that

02:30.271 --> 02:32.403
if you weren't so gross.

02:34.615 --> 02:36.036
That's right.

02:36.036 --> 02:38.279
I'm gross,
in an impressive way,

02:38.279 --> 02:39.580
like the gross
domestic product

02:39.580 --> 02:41.702
of a major
industrialized nation.

02:41.702 --> 02:44.285
I think that got her.

02:44.285 --> 02:46.207
She was signing Princess
up for a dog fashion show

02:46.207 --> 02:47.668
here at the park.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.050
I'm going to do it so I can be
close to Princess.

02:50.050 --> 02:52.002
But you're not really
a show dog.

02:52.002 --> 02:54.885
And I'm not a stunt dog either,
but I did just fine falling

02:54.885 --> 02:56.507
out of the window
onto your mother.

02:56.507 --> 02:58.299
Got it in one.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.304
STAN: I'm gonna get to hang out
with Princess.

03:03.304 --> 03:05.516
And be in a fashion show.

03:05.516 --> 03:07.608
I always wondered
what my life would be like

03:07.608 --> 03:08.809
if I were a model.

03:15.366 --> 03:16.907
Ahh!
What's that?!

03:16.907 --> 03:19.280
Relax, Mom, it's the text tone
on my phone.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.322
Oh, good, ever since
the dog fell on my head,

03:21.322 --> 03:23.083
I've been hearing bells.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.666
I was worried it had spread
into a bad case of the boings.

03:27.378 --> 03:29.089
There is no texting
at dinner, Tyler.

03:29.089 --> 03:30.251
You know the rule.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.133
Ooh, I got a text!

03:33.133 --> 03:34.465
Me, too!

03:34.465 --> 03:35.966
But you guys said
no texting at dinner.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.468
This is different.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.300
We don't have friends,
so it must be important.

03:41.101 --> 03:42.683
MAN: ( on message tone )
Tyler's awesome.

03:42.683 --> 03:45.306
Tyler, you changed
my text tone.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.398
I love it!

03:47.398 --> 03:49.310
Ah, it's a group text
from Nikki.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.442
She's sent it to
all of us.

03:51.442 --> 03:53.354
Tyler, why is your girlfriend
texting all of us?

03:53.354 --> 03:55.736
'Cause she's not coming back
from El Salvador.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.119
Their president has declared
her beauty a national treasure

03:59.119 --> 04:01.282
and asked her to stay
to increase tourism.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.365
Their new motto is,
"Come to El Salvador.

04:04.365 --> 04:05.326
We got Nikki."

04:06.667 --> 04:08.869
Well, we talked about it
and decided

04:08.869 --> 04:11.292
if she's not coming back,
we have to break up.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.374
And she's so busy
giving speeches,

04:13.374 --> 04:16.757
visiting hospitals,
posing for the new flag.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.549
Plus, you know,
I got a lot going on, too.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.881
Yes, you do.

04:20.881 --> 04:21.882
So much going on.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.013
No, you don't.

04:28.849 --> 04:31.392
So what do you think?

04:31.392 --> 04:33.063
For the fashion show.

04:33.063 --> 04:34.395
Robert helped me
pick it out.

04:34.395 --> 04:35.776
Where is Robert?

04:38.399 --> 04:41.662
Robert, I'm beginning
to question your motives.

04:43.073 --> 04:45.666
Stan, the fashion show
is for clothes.

04:45.666 --> 04:47.077
That's just a costume.

04:47.077 --> 04:48.869
Hey.

04:48.869 --> 04:50.831
Why don't I make the outfits
for you?

04:50.831 --> 04:52.373
I can wear
one of my designs

04:52.373 --> 04:53.874
as I'm walking you
down the runway

04:53.874 --> 04:55.756
and drum up a little business
for myself.

04:55.756 --> 05:00.260
As long as we can make it
about you, that'll be great.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.851
Are you still reading
that group text

05:10.851 --> 05:12.312
that Nikki sent out?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.695
The one that Nikki and Tyler
keep texting each other on,

05:14.695 --> 05:16.647
not realizing
it's being sent to all of us?

05:16.647 --> 05:18.359
That would be prying.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.111
A horrible and inappropriate
invasion of privacy.

05:21.111 --> 05:22.112
What's your favorite one?

05:22.112 --> 05:23.824
This one right here.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.446
Where he says,
"He's so sad they're apart

05:25.446 --> 05:28.449
because they go together
like frogs and green.

05:28.449 --> 05:30.911
Like armpits and tickles.

05:30.911 --> 05:33.454
Where does
he get his analogies?

05:33.454 --> 05:36.126
Technically they're right,
but they're just weird.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.219
Should we be doing this?

05:39.219 --> 05:41.091
This really is an intrusion.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.513
What choice do we have?

05:42.513 --> 05:44.134
I could read about his
most intimate thoughts

05:44.134 --> 05:45.305
on his Buddy
Bop account,

05:45.305 --> 05:47.347
but he won't accept
my bop request.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.139
No, you're right.

05:49.139 --> 05:50.971
We need to keep tabs on him
so we can help him.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.312
It's just good parenting.

05:52.312 --> 05:53.774
He does need supervision.

05:53.774 --> 05:56.687
He used the emoticon
that looked like this...

05:56.687 --> 05:58.108
when he clearly meant...

06:01.151 --> 06:02.322
Oh.

06:03.283 --> 06:05.155
Tyler says he's lonely,

06:05.155 --> 06:08.198
like a cricket
at a grasshopper party.

06:08.198 --> 06:10.541
Where does he
get these analogies?

06:10.541 --> 06:12.292
That is so sad.

06:12.292 --> 06:14.374
Poor little cricket.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.207
Okay, I'm starting to see
where he gets it.

06:22.172 --> 06:24.595
( laughing )

06:24.595 --> 06:27.598
STAN: I'm having so much fun,
I'm laughing in my brain.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.392
Stan, we have to get dressed
for the fashion show.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.144
Oh, please, not yet.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.016
Just five more minutes
of playing with Princess.

06:36.016 --> 06:37.397
The show's about to start.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.439
We have to get ready.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.940
Why are you
even here?

06:39.940 --> 06:41.321
You losers
can't beat us.

06:41.321 --> 06:43.323
We only buy dog clothes
from designers

06:43.323 --> 06:44.575
who are trending.

06:44.575 --> 06:48.028
Who?
Diane von Furstenbark?

06:48.028 --> 06:50.701
Giorgio Arf-mani?

06:52.332 --> 06:55.375
Yes.
And also Vera Wag.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.418
I don't know
what's worse,

06:58.418 --> 07:00.210
the fact that my joke
backfired,

07:00.210 --> 07:01.752
or that those things
exist.

07:03.844 --> 07:06.306
Thank you,
Bill and Gary.

07:06.306 --> 07:08.929
I'm not sure
which is which.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.853
And here's Heather
with Princess,

07:12.853 --> 07:15.686
again not sure
which is which,

07:15.686 --> 07:20.060
modeling the latest
from Tommy Hilfigrrrr.

07:21.231 --> 07:24.024
Whoa, that is a tough act
to follow.

07:24.024 --> 07:27.488
And finally, here's
Avery with Stan.

07:31.832 --> 07:34.244
That's right, you love it.

07:34.244 --> 07:37.377
Model poses. Pouty.

07:37.377 --> 07:38.999
Contemplative.

07:40.380 --> 07:43.674
Rebel that you just
got to have.

07:46.086 --> 07:47.798
Who were you wearing?

07:47.798 --> 07:49.219
Oh, I designed these
myself.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.851
I'm Avery Jennings.

07:50.851 --> 07:52.142
That doesn't make any sense.

07:52.142 --> 07:54.264
Where's the dog pun?

07:54.264 --> 07:56.476
Averr-y?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.018
Aha!

07:58.018 --> 08:00.400
I love it!

08:00.400 --> 08:03.944
Well, it looks like the judges
have made their decision

08:03.944 --> 08:05.566
and we don't even have
to bring those

08:05.566 --> 08:07.237
other losers back out.

08:08.408 --> 08:10.571
Our winner is

08:10.571 --> 08:14.374
Stan wearing
Averr-y Jennings!

08:14.374 --> 08:17.538
STAN: Ah, oh, this is
for you, Princess.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.879
My love.

08:18.879 --> 08:20.170
My muse.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.251
Oh, no.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.462
Where is she going?

08:22.462 --> 08:24.174
Princess!

08:25.215 --> 08:27.087
Stan, this is very weird.

08:27.087 --> 08:28.088
I did not make this.

08:28.088 --> 08:29.389
Where did this come from?

08:36.727 --> 08:39.940
Stan, I don't know
why you're so down.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.692
You got to spend time
with Princess today,

08:41.692 --> 08:43.233
like you wanted.

08:43.233 --> 08:44.775
You knew that
it wasn't gonna last.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.357
I'm a dog.
I don't think about the future.

08:47.357 --> 08:49.109
I have no concept of time.

08:49.109 --> 08:51.031
Is Julius Caesar
still proconsul?

08:52.282 --> 08:55.365
Stan, he's been dead
for 2,000 years.

08:55.365 --> 08:56.536
What?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.159
This day just
keeps getting worse.

08:59.159 --> 09:03.123
Well, at least you got to
spend time with Princess today.

09:03.123 --> 09:05.796
But after having that time,
I love her more than ever

09:05.796 --> 09:08.218
and being away from her
hurts more than ever.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.380
I wish I'd never even
done this.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.471
( doorbell ringing )

09:17.017 --> 09:18.478
A lot of people
liked the clothes

09:18.478 --> 09:20.390
you made
for your disgusting animal.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.272
So make clothes
for Princess.

09:22.272 --> 09:24.564
I don't get it,
but if it's trending, I do it.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.238
I haven't had non-Greek yogurt
in two years.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.031
So...

09:31.031 --> 09:33.153
you want me to make
clothes for your dog

09:33.153 --> 09:35.035
and you're not even
being nice to me?

09:35.035 --> 09:36.617
I am being nice.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.249
I didn't say ulchh
when I stepped into your house.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.411
Ulchh.

09:43.293 --> 09:45.375
And I don't just want
clothes for my dog.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.257
I want to sell them
to other people.

09:47.257 --> 09:50.971
I want to stupid work with you
in a stupid business.

09:50.971 --> 09:54.304
And why would I want
to work with you?

09:54.304 --> 09:55.425
I do my own thing.

09:55.425 --> 09:56.476
I don't need a partner.

09:56.476 --> 09:58.478
Especially
one who's so ulch.

09:58.478 --> 10:00.220
First, you're saying it
wrong.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.312
It's ulchh.

10:02.312 --> 10:05.565
Second, you don't have
connections and I do.

10:05.565 --> 10:06.987
You sew.
I sell.

10:06.987 --> 10:08.649
We make money.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.111
It's not like anyone's buying
your people clothes.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.402
How do you know that?

10:12.402 --> 10:14.034
I just saw them
and assumed.

10:15.195 --> 10:19.539
Well, I'm charmed
by your sales pitch...

10:20.791 --> 10:22.082
but I'm gonna say no.

10:22.082 --> 10:23.954
Fine.

10:23.954 --> 10:25.666
If you want to let opportunity
pass you by.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.210
I was just so nice to you
for no reason.

10:35.175 --> 10:36.636
Can you believe her?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.258
There's no way

10:38.258 --> 10:40.220
I'd want to work with her
on anything.

10:40.220 --> 10:44.314
Although, if you did,
I'd get to see Princess again.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.856
Which would be great.

10:45.856 --> 10:47.067
It's Heather.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.689
She's a human shark.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.271
She has six rows of teeth
and an old sailor's leg

10:51.271 --> 10:52.322
in her stomach.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.574
Avery, please.

10:54.574 --> 10:56.446
This means
so much to me.

10:56.446 --> 10:58.328
I never ask you
for help of any kind...

10:58.328 --> 10:59.950
You ask for help
all the time.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.661
You didn't let me finish.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.335
I never ask you for help of
any kind except all the time.

11:06.246 --> 11:07.918
Please, Avery.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.501
Okay, fine.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.714
You know, how much
your happiness means to me.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.465
Oh, thank you so much.

11:15.465 --> 11:16.927
I owe ya.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.468
I'm not making
any promises,

11:18.468 --> 11:21.471
but someone might be
finding a squirrel

11:21.471 --> 11:25.105
under her pillow
tonight.

11:32.482 --> 11:35.365
Are you dipping pizza
in chocolate fondue?

11:35.365 --> 11:38.909
You're way smarter than
anyone knows.

11:38.909 --> 11:40.450
Yep.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.532
I got me a warm bucket
of chocolate.

11:42.532 --> 11:44.244
There are only
a couple of words

11:44.244 --> 11:45.746
that come after
"warm bucket of"

11:45.746 --> 11:47.287
that are good
and this is one of them.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.331
Good thing I have
my emergency marshmallow

11:51.331 --> 11:54.094
in case of a marshmallow
emergency.

11:54.094 --> 11:55.255
Does that happen a lot?

11:55.255 --> 11:58.718
It only has to happen once.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.470
So how'd you get this?

12:00.470 --> 12:03.513
I caught Mom and Dad snooping
through my texts with Nikki.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.145
So we've been sending
each other fake texts

12:05.145 --> 12:06.436
about how sad I am

12:06.436 --> 12:08.268
so Mom and Dad
will buy me stuff.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.020
Watch this.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.732
He says, he wishes he could be
with Nikki in El Salvador.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.524
The only thing
that will take his mind off

12:14.524 --> 12:16.526
it is if he gets
a new BMX bike.

12:16.526 --> 12:18.158
I know how he feels.

12:18.158 --> 12:20.410
When Amy Garner broke up
with me in 8th grade,

12:20.410 --> 12:22.412
I tried to find
comfort in a pair of

12:22.412 --> 12:24.204
high top roller skates.

12:24.204 --> 12:28.038
But no matter how fast
I skated backwards,

12:28.038 --> 12:29.960
I couldn't turn back
the clock.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.833
Is this the same Amy Garner
you had lunch with last week?

12:40.380 --> 12:42.552
Hey, I want
a piece of this scam.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.344
No way.
This is my scam.

12:44.344 --> 12:46.016
Not if I tell
Mommy and Daddy.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.018
Of course,
I'll stay quiet

12:48.018 --> 12:50.230
if I get a new Stacy
Startles-A-Lot doll.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.352
You tap it on the shoulder
and it goes...

12:52.352 --> 12:53.984
( screaming )

12:55.946 --> 12:58.198
Chloe, you can't
blackmail me.

12:58.198 --> 13:00.360
Okay.
How about extortion?

13:00.360 --> 13:02.032
It'd be a shame
if something happened

13:02.032 --> 13:04.284
to this lovely
fondue set.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.248
He says he
can't be happy

13:08.248 --> 13:11.461
unless his sister gets
a Stacy Startles-A-Lot doll?

13:11.461 --> 13:14.414
He never cares
if anyone else is happy.

13:14.414 --> 13:16.716
He's playing us!

13:16.716 --> 13:18.298
What a betrayal!

13:18.298 --> 13:20.921
To take our spying on him
and turn it into something ugly.

13:22.262 --> 13:25.345
We need to give him
a taste of his own medicine.

13:25.345 --> 13:29.229
Hm, like with my great, great
uncle Cornelius Steincrotch.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.311
He kept rustling cattle
until the townsfolk

13:31.311 --> 13:32.482
taught him a thing or two.

13:32.482 --> 13:33.854
What did they do?

13:33.854 --> 13:34.935
They taught him
a thing or two.

13:34.935 --> 13:37.277
About bookkeeping.

13:37.277 --> 13:38.488
He went to work
at the general store

13:38.488 --> 13:39.649
and later became
an alderman.

13:46.206 --> 13:49.249
So you'll work with me
if our dogs can play together?

13:49.249 --> 13:50.410
That's the deal.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.791
Fine.

13:51.791 --> 13:54.254
STAN: Princess let's frolic.

13:54.254 --> 13:56.586
Where can I put my purse
where it won't get gross?

13:56.586 --> 14:01.341
It's couture, which is French
for "Daddy loves me."

14:03.513 --> 14:05.305
STAN: This is
the best frolicking ever.

14:05.305 --> 14:06.806
Eww.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.678
You're making the holes
for the tails so big.

14:08.678 --> 14:10.810
What kind of fat-tailed dogs
do you know?

14:13.023 --> 14:14.774
Whatever, Heather.
I don't even care.

14:14.774 --> 14:17.147
I'm just doing this so that
our dogs can play together.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.398
Well, you better care.

14:18.398 --> 14:19.900
These clothes
have to be popular.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.571
Because I'm popular.

14:21.571 --> 14:23.783
And your dog's tail
looks like a burrito.

14:25.405 --> 14:28.748
STAN: That's always been
my problem area.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.792
Gross.

14:32.792 --> 14:35.295
Gross.

14:35.295 --> 14:36.876
That's cute.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.338
Kidding.

14:38.338 --> 14:39.379
Gross.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.502
See, I'm funny.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.509
She has no taste
and she's really annoying,

14:49.509 --> 14:52.272
but her dog clothes
are gonna sell.

14:52.272 --> 14:55.145
Texting about
somebody else.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.396
How do you spell your name?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.287
Are you sure, Bennett?

15:07.287 --> 15:08.868
I mean, this seems
little extreme.

15:08.868 --> 15:11.081
Trust me.
We'll call Tyler's bluff

15:11.081 --> 15:12.582
and he'll learn his lesson.

15:12.582 --> 15:14.414
Okay, but we're gonna have to be
real smooth

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
so he doesn't catch on.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.249
Tyler, we have something
we need to confess.

15:21.211 --> 15:25.215
Son, we've been reading
your texts with Nikki.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.427
I'm outraged.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.100
Super,
super outraged!

15:30.100 --> 15:33.433
CHLOE: This is the worst acting
I've ever seen.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.267
Son, we're going to
make it up to you.

15:37.267 --> 15:39.269
We know
from reading your texts

15:39.269 --> 15:41.771
that if you can't be
with Nikki in El Salvador,

15:41.771 --> 15:44.114
the only thing
that will make you happy

15:44.114 --> 15:45.655
is a new BMX bike

15:45.655 --> 15:48.368
and a Stacy Startles-A-Lot doll
for your sister.

15:48.368 --> 15:50.280
I'm gonna startle that doll.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.072
I'm gonna startle her good.

15:53.243 --> 15:57.247
So, Tyler, we have decided
to get you...

15:57.247 --> 15:58.788
TYLER: A bike.
Yes!

15:58.788 --> 16:01.751
A ticket to El Salvador
to see Nikki!

16:01.751 --> 16:03.343
I'm gonna write
my name on her seat

16:03.343 --> 16:04.714
so everyone knows
she's mine.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.046
Wait, you said "Nikki?"

16:07.047 --> 16:08.258
Yep.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.140
That's what you texted
you wanted

16:10.140 --> 16:11.891
so it must be true.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.353
TYLER:
Nikki broke up with me!

16:13.353 --> 16:15.265
I can't go to El Salvador.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.767
But I also can't let them know
I was messing with them.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.939
Thank you, guys.

16:19.939 --> 16:21.101
That's great.

16:23.063 --> 16:25.735
CHLOE: Well, I guess I'll have
to startle something else.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.068
( screaming )

16:28.068 --> 16:29.909
Thank you, Mommy.

16:29.909 --> 16:31.321
That's great.

16:33.203 --> 16:36.376
Ellen, I thought Tyler would
confess and learn his lesson.

16:36.376 --> 16:37.827
ELLEN: This is
your fault, Bennett.

16:37.827 --> 16:39.879
You're blaming me
in your mind, aren't you?

16:39.879 --> 16:41.171
ELLEN: Yes, I am.

16:41.171 --> 16:43.123
No, we're in this together.

16:46.426 --> 16:48.888
Working with you
is so boring.

16:48.888 --> 16:51.261
There's no office gossip.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.682
I'll start it.

16:52.682 --> 16:55.055
You hear about that
boring girl I work with?

16:58.308 --> 16:59.349
You don't work with me.

16:59.349 --> 17:00.730
You just distract me

17:00.730 --> 17:03.603
until I sew the clothes
to my sleeve.

17:06.236 --> 17:08.027
That is
the worst gossip ever.

17:09.449 --> 17:11.281
I'm gonna
get some fresh air.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.652
It's so boring in here.

17:12.652 --> 17:14.534
I feel sorry
for that fern.

17:16.956 --> 17:20.750
Avery, I can see how much
this is eating you up inside.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.752
Just tell her off,
it's okay.

17:22.752 --> 17:23.963
No, I can't.

17:23.963 --> 17:25.255
She'll take Princess.

17:25.255 --> 17:26.296
But it's not working.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.797
With her insulting you,

17:27.797 --> 17:30.049
I'm not having
any fun with Princess.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.262
I need both my girls
to be happy.

17:32.262 --> 17:34.974
Stan, you can't give up
on Princess

17:34.974 --> 17:36.806
just because Heather's a jerk.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.438
I can put up with her.

17:38.438 --> 17:41.521
I'm just getting
something from my purse.

17:41.521 --> 17:45.185
Hard candy is very popular
with my mouth right now.

17:45.185 --> 17:46.446
Don't touch it.

17:46.446 --> 17:48.528
You may think lameness
isn't contagious,

17:48.528 --> 17:51.991
but one time, a nerd touched
my pencil, then I got a zit.

17:53.863 --> 17:55.785
STAN: I'm sorry, Princess.

17:55.785 --> 17:57.997
I just can't let my best friend
be treated like this.

17:59.789 --> 18:01.331
Hey!

18:01.331 --> 18:03.253
Your dog's got my purse!

18:03.253 --> 18:06.045
Where's your
polo mallet?

18:06.045 --> 18:07.417
What?

18:07.417 --> 18:08.418
We don't have
a polo mallet.

18:08.418 --> 18:11.881
Ugh, average people
are the worst.

18:11.881 --> 18:13.263
Do something!

18:13.263 --> 18:14.384
No.
Stop.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.385
Don't.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.059
That's it.
We're done.

18:20.059 --> 18:22.602
Keep your fat-tailed dog
away from Princess.

18:25.064 --> 18:28.278
Stan, you didn't have to
do that for me.

18:28.278 --> 18:29.399
Yeah, Avery.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.440
I did.

18:33.903 --> 18:35.695
Goodbye, Princess.

18:48.838 --> 18:51.010
Tyler, you can't
go to El Salvador.

18:51.010 --> 18:52.422
You're my fondue hook-up.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.424
Baby got to get her dip on.

18:55.845 --> 18:57.677
Well, I can't let
Mom and Dad know

18:57.677 --> 18:59.349
I was threatening
to go to El Salvador

18:59.349 --> 19:01.311
just to get a BMX bike.
But don't worry.

19:01.311 --> 19:04.143
There's no way they'll actually
let me get on the plane.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.317
There's no way he'll actually
get on the plane.

19:08.528 --> 19:10.400
Trust me.
He'll crack.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.531
Oh, he's gonna crack.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.323
Long before
That taxi gets here.

19:13.323 --> 19:14.694
( car honking )

19:14.694 --> 19:15.695
Unless they're early.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.989
There's no way they're gonna
let me get in that taxi.

19:19.989 --> 19:21.991
So the taxi is here.

19:23.373 --> 19:24.414
Guess...

19:24.414 --> 19:26.586
I'm gonna go...

19:26.586 --> 19:27.587
get in the taxi?

19:27.587 --> 19:29.459
Guess you are?

19:29.459 --> 19:31.501
Guess I am?

19:32.882 --> 19:34.464
TYLER: There's no way

19:34.464 --> 19:36.386
they're gonna let me
go to El Salvador.

19:36.386 --> 19:38.598
BENNETT: There's no way
he's gonna go to El Salvador.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.600
ELLEN: That's a really
nice color on Tyler.

19:42.141 --> 19:44.304
CHLOE: Why is no one talking?

19:45.515 --> 19:46.806
Okay, then...

19:48.107 --> 19:49.399
I'm going to El Salvador.

19:50.810 --> 19:54.524
Yes, son.
Off to El Salvador you go.

19:54.524 --> 19:58.318
Right.
Off to El Salvador.

19:58.318 --> 20:01.531
TYLER: They're gonna stop me
any second...

20:01.531 --> 20:04.123
any second...

20:04.123 --> 20:05.325
any second.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.380
What happened?

20:10.380 --> 20:13.423
I did not think
he would go this far, Ellen.

20:13.423 --> 20:15.675
I did not think
it would go this far, Nikki.

20:19.339 --> 20:21.971
( door bell rings )

20:21.971 --> 20:23.973
Stan, it's the doorbell.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.515
You usually
bark at the doorbell.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.977
You remember
the good old days, Avery?

20:27.977 --> 20:31.311
When I still had hope
and Caesar was still proconsul.

20:33.693 --> 20:36.356
Stan, eating a Caesar salad
out of the take out bag

20:36.356 --> 20:38.358
does not give you a strong
personal connection

20:38.358 --> 20:40.450
to any of the Caesars.

20:41.821 --> 20:45.745
So do you think Princess
is as sad as you are?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.287
I know she is.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.789
Then I think
I have a way to fix this.

20:54.173 --> 20:56.796
I got your text that you know
why my dog is sick.

20:56.796 --> 20:58.338
How did you even know
she's sick?

20:58.338 --> 20:59.469
What did you feed her?

20:59.469 --> 21:00.800
What did you do?

21:01.931 --> 21:03.433
Nothing.

21:03.433 --> 21:06.436
I know that she's sad
because she misses Stan.

21:06.436 --> 21:08.388
That's ridiculous.

21:09.889 --> 21:11.391
STAN: Princess!

21:11.391 --> 21:13.062
Yeah!

21:13.062 --> 21:15.064
Frolicking again.

21:16.396 --> 21:17.987
See?

21:17.987 --> 21:20.900
Princess is happy now
that she's back with Stan.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.242
You can't be such
a horrible person

21:23.242 --> 21:25.365
that you don't care
about your dog's happiness.

21:25.365 --> 21:28.037
Of course, I care about
her happiness.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.869
Why do you think
I bought her a car?

21:32.372 --> 21:34.874
How about we let our dogs
play together

21:34.874 --> 21:37.296
and you and I have nothing
to do with each other.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.379
Fine.
They can play together.

21:39.379 --> 21:41.220
But this will never last.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.592
Yes, it will.

21:43.763 --> 21:45.765
It's true love.

21:45.765 --> 21:48.888
You really need
to get a boyfriend.

21:51.230 --> 21:52.772
I would love to
disagree with you!

21:55.274 --> 21:58.027
STAN:
Princess and I are so happy.

21:58.027 --> 21:59.699
We've been seeing
so much of each other

21:59.699 --> 22:02.071
I don't really have time
for anything else.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.443
I promise, buddy.

22:03.443 --> 22:05.535
We'll play this weekend.

22:10.540 --> 22:15.334
So how was El Salvador?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.627
Nice.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.258
Yeah.
I've heard that.

22:19.258 --> 22:21.461
Guess I'll just unpack.

22:21.461 --> 22:23.302
Guess so.
Sounds good.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.846
Is everyone drinking
crazy water?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.307
He went to El Salvador!

22:28.307 --> 22:29.308
Talk about it!

22:30.680 --> 22:31.681
Ah!
