15:40.899 --> 15:43.231
What happened here?

15:43.318 --> 15:46.936
Hook. This is why he attacked you.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.362
(SCOFFS) To get you out of the store.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.026
What did he want?

15:56.665 --> 15:58.576
You have it, Mr. Smee?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.953
What is it, Captain?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.212
It's the end of the crocodile's hope.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.879
Now he's trapped here.

16:14.724 --> 16:19.468
Rumple! Rumple, stop it! Stop! Please.

16:19.563 --> 16:23.181
Belle, you're right.
I have to retrieve what's mine.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.683
Let me help you.

16:26.778 --> 16:27.938
This is my fight.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.485
And this is my fault.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.898
If Hook had never attacked me,
you never would have left the shop.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.154
How do you propose
that we get the shawl back?

16:35.829 --> 16:39.538
Have you dueled with a pirate before?
How exactly are you gonna help me?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.660
Well, I'm notjust going to sit here
and do nothing!

16:41.751 --> 16:44.003
No. You're going to go back
to the library,

16:44.087 --> 16:47.079
lock the door, and wait for me
to dispense with this problem.

16:47.174 --> 16:51.508
And if I don't? You will cast some spell
that gives me no choice?

16:51.595 --> 16:54.382
No. I trust you'll do as | wish,

16:54.472 --> 16:57.339
as you trust me to be a better man.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.516
Belle, please.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.970
Hook has maybe cost me the chance
of finding my son.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.097
I don't want to lose you, too.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.028
Here, look.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.822
I want you to take this,

17:13.950 --> 17:17.909
just in case Hook is stupid enough
to come after you again.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.578
Point this, pull this trigger,

17:20.665 --> 17:24.157
and the gun will do the rest for you,
all right?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.876
-All right?
-Yes, yes.

17:27.964 --> 17:28.953
Wait.

17:32.177 --> 17:37.137
Promise me that you going after Hook
is just about getting the shawl back.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.929
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

17:47.567 --> 17:48.727
Ahhh!

17:50.487 --> 17:52.853
The Yaoguai wasn't at the lake.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.196
Well, I'm sorry,
I must have misread that one.

-(GRUNT|NG)

17:57.994 --> 18:00.986

in the wrong direction on purpose.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.168
Let her go.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.666

18:33.530 --> 18:34.565
Go.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.785
I didn't expect to see you again.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.086
Thank you.

18:49.212 --> 18:52.796
I had to put up with brutes like them
when I served in the Emperor's army.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.040
Fools who think we have no business
holding a sword.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.254
I only wish there was someone there
to stand up for me. (GROANS SOFTLY)

setting soon. We need to move out.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.401
(STAMMERING)
What do you mean, we?

19:16.072 --> 19:20.611
You tracked the Yaoguai in a matter
of hours. It took me weeks.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.281
You track the beast, and I'll kill it.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.160
I'd be honored to help you.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.778
(CHUCKLES)

19:59.324 --> 20:01.781

And this is how you repay me?

20:24.516 --> 20:29.306
That object you stole from me,
I want it back.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.431
(STRAINED VOICE) I gave it to Hook.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.887
And where is he?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.016
I don't know.

20:34.234 --> 20:38.193
We met on a rooftop.
He didn't tell me anything.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.812
And why would he?

20:40.949 --> 20:44.362
Hook knows exactly
what you are, Mr. Smee.

Archie knew how much
Henry loves this dog.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.884
We decided he should have him.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.971
That is, if you're up
for taking care of him, Henry.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.475

Okay. Come on.
Come on, boy, come on.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.280
Let's go. Come on, boy.

All right, look, I know that there's a lot
to work out logistically, but...

24:19.792 --> 24:25.003
No, no, no. Oh. lthink giving Pongo
to Henry is a great idea.

24:27.216 --> 24:31.380

How are you going to kill the Yaoguai?

26:28.337 --> 26:30.248
I'm not.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.789
You are.

26:32.884 --> 26:36.593

26:36.679 --> 26:37.964
You have good instincts.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.216
You tracked down that beast
faster than I ever could.

26:40.308 --> 26:43.800
Tracking it and killing it
are not the same thing.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.971
There was once a time when people
didn't think that I had what it took either,

26:48.065 --> 26:49.475
but I proved them wrong.

26:49.567 --> 26:50.932
How?

26:51.027 --> 26:52.688
By showing them that I had
the warrior's spirit.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.437
Once I found something
worth fighting for,

26:56.574 --> 26:59.691
I fought for it with everything that I had.
I never gave up.

27:00.578 --> 27:04.662
Belle, the fate of my village
depends on you.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.370
Don't be afraid.

27:13.716 --> 27:18.210
I'm not afraid of you.
And I'm not leaving without that.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.091
Well, I admire your loyalty.
But helping Rumplestiltskin?

27:21.182 --> 27:23.594
I'm afraid you're fighting a lost cause.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.470
He needs that shawl to find his son.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.177
And what makes you think his son
wants to be found?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.979
Hmm? I'm doing that boy a favor.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.978
Have you not hurt Rumple enough?

27:33.069 --> 27:34.229
Oh.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.232
I've hurt him?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.154
You stole his wife.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.363
Tell me something, love.

27:43.496 --> 27:48.581
If a woman comes to you
and begs you to take her away,

27:50.586 --> 27:52.417
is that theft?

27:53.381 --> 27:54.871
Why would she leave him?

27:55.091 --> 27:57.207
Because he was a coward.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.175
And because she loved me.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.348
I should have burned this
the moment I acquired it.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.054
Why didn't you?

28:08.646 --> 28:10.682
Because she made it.

28:10.773 --> 28:15.938
I'm sorry she died. But vengeance?
Vengeance won't bring her back.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.770
Died?

28:18.865 --> 28:22.198
Like it was some kind of accident.
Is that what he told you?

28:22.285 --> 28:23.821
He didn't say.

28:23.911 --> 28:24.900
No, of course not.

28:24.996 --> 28:28.659
Of course he would leave out the most
important detail of her passing.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.582
And what would that be?

28:32.545 --> 28:34.877
He killed her.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.631
He ripped out her heart

28:39.719 --> 28:43.007
and he crushed it right in front of me.

28:43.431 --> 28:44.591
-No.
-Oh, yes.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.297
-No!
-Yes.

28:49.562 --> 28:54.898
He would do anything.
Anything to hold onto his power.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.772
Why do you think anyone
who's ever gotten close to him

28:58.863 --> 29:02.071
has either run away or been killed.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.652
Now what makes you think
you're any different?

29:07.747 --> 29:09.783
And tell me something, darling,

29:09.874 --> 29:13.082
why would you want to fight
for a man like that?

29:13.169 --> 29:17.663
Because I still see good in him.
Because I believe he's changed.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.835
Because his heart is true.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.043

32:58.561 --> 33:03.601
So she exiled me to this land.
And turned me into a monster.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.103
I tried to warn the villagers,

33:06.193 --> 33:08.104
but no one understood what I really was.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.740
I am forever in your debt.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.823
Please, tell me how I might repay you.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.659
My friend's hurt. She needs a doctor.

33:25.337 --> 33:29.751
As do you.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.798
I don't know.
The yard looks kind of small.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.464
Are you going to say that
about every house we look at?

34:58.555 --> 35:00.261
I grew up on a farm.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.884
This isn't about the houses, is it?

35:08.524 --> 35:10.515
We buried a friend this morning,
Mary Margaret.

35:10.609 --> 35:15.399
And it made me realize,
I don't want to die here.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.026
But our home, David?

35:18.117 --> 35:20.073
It doesn't exist anymore.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.993
The ogres are back. Cora's in power...

35:23.080 --> 35:27.119
Which is exactly why we need to return.
To make things right, to fight...

35:27.251 --> 35:31.415
I'm tired of fighting.
That's all we've ever done.

35:32.131 --> 35:36.465
We have a chance here,
a chance to be together.

No, they're blueprints.

36:07.958 --> 36:13.043
I had some ideas for what to do if David
and Mary Margaret move out. Look.

36:13.130 --> 36:16.122
You want to make
Mary Margaret's room an armory?

36:16.258 --> 36:21.343
Yeah, you know, for weapons and stuff.
To protect us. From Regina.

Henry, we were wrong.
Regina didn't do it.

37:00.511 --> 37:03.674

that's worth fighting for,

38:00.070 --> 38:01.935
