No.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.289
What happened to you
after her murder?

41:15.389 --> 41:17.291
I went in to the system.

41:17.391 --> 41:20.161
Youth halls, foster homes.

41:20.194 --> 41:22.763
So, the killer was never
caught, never punished.

41:22.863 --> 41:24.198
No.

41:24.298 --> 41:26.201
Detective, when you shot
and killed Mr. flores,

41:26.301 --> 41:28.403
weren't you, in effect,
avenging your mother's death?

41:28.503 --> 41:30.305
Belk: Objection.
You've got a lotof fucking nerve.

41:30.405 --> 41:34.742
I'm way ahead of you, Mr. belk.
Counselor, you know better.

41:34.842 --> 41:35.977
I apologize, your honor.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.313
Detective,
another outburst like that,

41:38.413 --> 41:40.316
and I'll hold you in contempt.

41:40.416 --> 41:43.386
I'm sorry, your honor.
It won't happen again.

41:43.486 --> 41:46.589
Strike that last question
and response from the record.

41:57.234 --> 41:59.269
How'd it go?

41:59.369 --> 42:00.304
Chandler ambushed me.

42:00.404 --> 42:01.805
Somebody slipped her
my file.

42:01.905 --> 42:03.907
Jesus.

42:04.007 --> 42:06.543
Golliher's ready for us.

42:06.643 --> 42:07.744
If you're up for it.

42:07.844 --> 42:09.079
After this bullshit,

42:09.214 --> 42:10.315
the morgue will be
a breath of fresh air.

42:10.415 --> 42:14.785
[ Camera shutters clicking ]

42:14.885 --> 42:17.955
Dr. golliher:
We recovered about 60%of the skeleton at the site.

42:18.055 --> 42:20.024
Given the shallow nature
of the grave,

42:20.124 --> 42:22.092
the rest of the remains
were no doubt

42:22.227 --> 42:22.960
scattered by animals
over the years.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.231
Is that enough? 60%?

42:25.264 --> 42:26.765
More than enough
in this case, detective.

42:26.865 --> 42:28.800
More than enough.
Tell us what you got, doc.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.903
Let's start
with the basics.

42:32.003 --> 42:33.672
Young male caucasoid.

42:33.772 --> 42:36.007
Comparison to maresh
growth standard indices

42:36.107 --> 42:38.477
puts his age
at approximately 10 years old.

42:38.577 --> 42:40.713
But this child
was a victim of severe,

42:40.813 --> 42:42.282
prolonged physical abuse.

42:42.382 --> 42:45.252
Victims of chronic abuse
often suffer growth disruption,

42:45.352 --> 42:47.987
abuse-related stunting
that skews age estimation.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.256
What you get is a skeleton

42:49.356 --> 42:51.324
that's smaller
than it should be.

42:51.424 --> 42:54.061
The long-limb bones are
shorter than one would expect.

42:54.161 --> 42:55.396
How old is he really?

42:55.496 --> 42:58.566
Uh, I would say --
best guess -- 12 or 13.

42:58.666 --> 43:00.067
Time of death?
We have the coin.

43:00.167 --> 43:01.702
Which gives us
the early parameter of 1989.

43:01.802 --> 43:03.937
So you think he's been
in the ground since then?

43:04.037 --> 43:05.105
25 years?

43:05.273 --> 43:06.574
Well, we have
surgical evidence

43:06.674 --> 43:09.744
that supports the estimation
of 18 to 24 years.

43:09.844 --> 43:11.145
Cause of death?

43:11.280 --> 43:13.415
Let's save cause of death
for last.

43:13.515 --> 43:14.849
Uh, but
before we get to that,

43:14.949 --> 43:16.451
I want to give you an idea

43:16.551 --> 43:18.186
of what this boy had to endure
during his short lifetime.

43:18.287 --> 43:21.323
All right.
Tell it your way, doc.

43:21.423 --> 43:23.292
Well, even
with partial remains,

43:23.358 --> 43:26.296
we have definitive proof
of tremendous skeletal trauma

43:26.329 --> 43:27.297
and chronic abuse.

43:27.363 --> 43:28.564
Bones heal themselves.

43:28.664 --> 43:30.500
Through the study
of bone regeneration,

43:30.600 --> 43:32.568
we can establish
a history of abuse.

43:32.668 --> 43:34.904
On these bones,
there are multiple lesions

43:35.004 --> 43:36.839
and different stages
of healing --

43:36.939 --> 43:38.442
fractures old and new.

43:38.542 --> 43:40.644
We only have two
of the four extremities,

43:40.744 --> 43:43.347
but both of them show
multiple instances of trauma.

43:43.447 --> 43:46.317
I counted
44 distinct locations

43:46.417 --> 43:48.919
indicating separate trauma
and various stages of healing.

43:49.019 --> 43:51.322
Jesus Christ.
44?

43:51.388 --> 43:52.589
And that's just the bones.

43:52.689 --> 43:54.959
The damage that
would have been inflicted

43:55.059 --> 43:56.894
on his vital organs
and tissue --

43:56.994 --> 43:58.530
it must have been
tremendous.

43:58.630 --> 44:01.032
Without a doubt, somebody
kicked the shit out of this kid

44:01.132 --> 44:04.168
on a daily basis.

44:04.336 --> 44:06.638
Let me show you something.

44:08.974 --> 44:12.511
The femur, the upper thigh.

44:12.611 --> 44:14.413
This line here
where the color changes

44:14.513 --> 44:15.514
is one of the lesions.

44:15.614 --> 44:16.649
This boy suffered
a powerful blow

44:16.749 --> 44:18.183
in the weeks before his death.

44:18.351 --> 44:20.118
It didn't break the bone,
but it damaged it.

44:20.218 --> 44:22.154
Would no doubt have caused
bruising and affected his walk.

44:22.254 --> 44:24.358
Somebody must have noticed.

44:24.391 --> 44:25.992
You would think.

44:26.092 --> 44:33.066
The right humerus shows two
separate and healed breaks --

44:33.166 --> 44:35.435
one spiral fracture, one bucket.

44:35.535 --> 44:37.236
Ah, spiral fracture
is the result

44:37.371 --> 44:39.139
of twisting the arm
with great force.

44:39.239 --> 44:40.708
Bucket fracture is a result

44:40.808 --> 44:44.244
from pulling the arm with
the same kind of violence.

44:44.379 --> 44:47.482
The ulna, the lower arm,

44:47.582 --> 44:51.619
shows a healed latitudinal
fracture, a parry fracture.

44:51.719 --> 44:54.255
The break caused
a slight deviation

44:54.390 --> 44:56.792
in the attitude of the bone.
You want to explain whatthat means to my partner?

44:56.892 --> 44:58.293
That means the bone

44:58.394 --> 44:59.695
was allowed to heal
in place after the injury.

44:59.795 --> 45:01.062
Nobody took him
to a doctor.

45:01.162 --> 45:02.398
Apparently not.

45:02.498 --> 45:04.533
It's a common accidental injury,

45:04.633 --> 45:06.267
but it can also be
a defensive one.

45:06.402 --> 45:07.770
Ward off a blow
with the forearm.

45:07.870 --> 45:09.872
Because of the lack
of medical attention,

45:09.972 --> 45:13.410
my supposition is that this was
not an accidental injury

45:13.443 --> 45:15.778
but, rather,
part of the abuse pattern.

45:15.878 --> 45:17.814
I got to take a leak.
