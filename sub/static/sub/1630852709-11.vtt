00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:41.041 --> 00:42.042


00:42.125 --> 00:45.920
Once a year,
Camp Splinterwood goes epic.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
They call it Splashageddon.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.134
It's the awesomest day of the summer.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.596
Chuck, get your swim cap and towel.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.014
Bomb, don't forget your shovel.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.599
Let's move it, slow pokes!

00:57.682 --> 01:01.561
What are we thinkin'? Sporty Chuck,
Casual Chuck, Bird-about-town Chuck?

01:01.644 --> 01:04.439
Oh, I'm gonna dig
the biggest sand hole ever!

01:04.522 --> 01:07.692
I'm gonna surf
on Terrence's belly flop waves!

01:07.776 --> 01:09.527
Waterslide! Waterslide!
Waterslide! Waterslide!

01:09.611 --> 01:10.528
-All right!

01:10.612 --> 01:12.572
Let's get our splash on!

01:12.655 --> 01:14.199
Cabin inspection!

01:16.451 --> 01:17.327
Filth!

01:18.369 --> 01:19.245
Disgusting!

01:19.329 --> 01:22.665
Hey, some people like pineapple on pizza!

01:22.749 --> 01:23.750
Ah…

01:26.669 --> 01:28.129
Is this laundry or rubbish?

01:28.213 --> 01:29.589
I'm not really into labels.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.133
I've never in my life seen such squalor!

01:32.217 --> 01:36.346
You three are forbidden to take part
in Splashageddon

01:36.429 --> 01:39.599
until this cabin is thoroughly cleaned,
scrubbed, and dusted!

01:39.682 --> 01:41.017
Aww…

01:41.100 --> 01:42.644
No wailing! I have spoken!

01:43.144 --> 01:47.941
Lynette, we both know
they're disgusting screw-ups…

01:49.317 --> 01:53.321
Why not let them go to Splashageddon
and they can clean up later?

01:53.404 --> 01:58.535
Or the four of you can stay here
and clean this cabin until it sparkles,

01:58.618 --> 02:00.662
and I mean sparkles!

02:00.745 --> 02:03.414
B-But I'm not even in this cabin!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.042
It's not fair!

02:09.546 --> 02:11.548
You're darn right it's not fair!

02:11.631 --> 02:14.843
I am not gonna stand for this injustice!

02:14.926 --> 02:17.095
I'm sure she's gone.
Let's just sneak out of here.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.435
You know, we could just clean the cabin
and then go to Splashageddon.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.565
Come on, Stella. Cleaning the cabin
would be admitting that Lynette is right

02:28.648 --> 02:31.192
and we're a bunch of lazy, no-good bums.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.319
But… isn't that what we are?

02:38.116 --> 02:41.035
That's it! We'll dig our way
to Splashageddon!

02:41.119 --> 02:44.122
We'll tunnel to the lake
and Lynette will never know we've left!

02:44.205 --> 02:46.916
Red! Red!
Red! Red! Red!

02:47.500 --> 02:49.002
Start diggin'!

02:49.085 --> 02:50.670
Bomb, legs please.

02:55.216 --> 02:59.345
Yeah, love the creativity, but this is
way more work than cleaning the cabin.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.639
Sometimes you gotta go with your gut.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.768
Well, my gut's telling me
this is not gonna end well.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.907
Okay. Time out. This is taking too long!

03:19.824 --> 03:22.577
I got it! Bomb, you should explode!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.454
Uh, okay! Here I go.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.877
Did-- Did I do it?

03:30.960 --> 03:34.130
Yeah, no. But that's okay
because I was just gonna-- Boo!

03:34.213 --> 03:36.883
Hey, come on, Red. That's not cool.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.093
Why don't you leave Bomb alone-- Boo!

03:40.845 --> 03:42.305
Sorry, everyone.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.350
Well, we gave it a shot.
Let's go back and clean the cabin.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no reason to admit defeat.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.271
We just need to use our heads.

03:50.355 --> 03:54.734
If there was ever a moment
I was meant for, it's this one!

03:58.529 --> 04:01.282
Oh, please.
Step aside.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.326
Hmm…

04:04.827 --> 04:05.745
-Whoa!
-Uhh!

04:10.250 --> 04:13.836
Stella, I like where your head's at…
literally. Come on!

04:13.920 --> 04:15.421
-Let's go!

04:19.550 --> 04:23.179
Okay, according to my calculations,
we should be there by now.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.639
What calculations?

04:24.722 --> 04:26.683
I calculate…

04:26.766 --> 04:27.642
Huh?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.437
Ah…

04:31.521 --> 04:32.438
Hmm…

04:32.522 --> 04:35.525
The familiar tangy essence
of decaying plant matter.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.777
A little gamey.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.487
Tastes like lake water!

04:45.910 --> 04:49.205
Oh, come on, boys.
No need for the adoration.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.916
We all know who got us to Splashageddon.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.878
Okay, okay, you were right
and I was wrong.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.012
I knew that water tasted familiar.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.681
Huh. That's weird. We seem
to be in the boys' bathroom.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.184
Uh, I don't think you're allowed
to be in here, Stella.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.478
Well, I'm not the one who led us here.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.522
I said we should clean the cabin.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.357
This is just a minor setback.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.109
I actually think
this is going pretty well.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.486
Listen to Red, Stella. He's never wrong.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.822
And even when he's wrong,
he's always right in the end.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.450
Yeah, Red always comes through.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.455
-Inappropriate!

05:41.132 --> 05:44.135
'Scuse me, stella. I'm wondering
if you'd like to purchase any items

05:44.218 --> 05:47.096
from our new line
of Red-themed merchandise?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.557
How about an "I Heart Red" foam finger?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.476
Or an autographed shirt?

05:51.559 --> 05:54.062
Or maybe Red-branded suntan lotion?

05:54.145 --> 05:55.688
-Ahh…

05:57.690 --> 06:00.735
You guys don't seriously think
this is gonna work, do you?

06:00.818 --> 06:03.821
I love Red, but he has no idea
what he's doing.

06:05.281 --> 06:09.077
B-B-But we always follow Red
when he doesn't know what he's doing!

06:09.160 --> 06:12.121
Just blindly put your trust in him.
That's how it works!

06:12.205 --> 06:15.750
Look, Red and me, we've been
best friends since we were hatchlings,

06:15.833 --> 06:18.419
but a stupid idea is a stupid idea,

06:18.503 --> 06:21.130
and I'm putting my foot down right now!

06:21.214 --> 06:23.591
-Uh-oh.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.052
-Stella!

06:28.930 --> 06:32.517
Stella, hold on! We'll be right down!

06:32.600 --> 06:33.976
Chuck, grab your towel!

06:36.521 --> 06:38.106
I'm coming!

06:43.653 --> 06:46.447
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

06:47.990 --> 06:52.245
Hey, check it out. I'm surfing lava!

06:53.454 --> 06:55.873
You are so lucky I'm an awesome surfer.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.501
Luck? Pfft. All part of the plan.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.670
Red! Red! Red! Red!

07:00.753 --> 07:02.380
Hey, you wanted to surf, right?

07:02.463 --> 07:03.673
Well, yeah.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.591
Weren't you just surfing back there?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.135
Sure. But--

07:07.218 --> 07:09.303
Come on, admit it, I got this!

07:09.387 --> 07:11.347
Yeah, we'll see about that.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.689
Yay, Red.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.399
Come on. Help me push.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.450
Where are we?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.841
Wha-wow!

07:46.924 --> 07:50.303
Nothing like a good scream
to clear out the lungs.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.849
The name is Rouge.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.350
What are you doing here?

07:56.434 --> 08:01.022
I'm on my way to Splashageddon,
but we got a little sidetracked.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.317
Whoa, that's a coincidence,
'cause that's where we're heading.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.819
Well, you made it, <i>mon ami</i>.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.863
Huh? You're right under the lake.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.533
How long have you been down here?

08:12.617 --> 08:17.955
Ooh, now let's see, um…
I'd say about 40 years or so.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.459
We fall into this mine shaft,
been stuck here ever since.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.296
Sure, it look bad, but I always
come through in the end.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.507
Boy, does that sound familiar.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.468
Eh, we'll be at the Splashageddon
any day now…

08:30.551 --> 08:33.471
soon as we can figure out
how to get out of here, eh?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.764
We? Who's we?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.601
My best friends in the whole world!
Eh? They believe in me!

08:38.684 --> 08:40.436
Ain't that right, <i>mes amis</i>?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.564
Buck, Flomb, Ella, say <i>bonjour.</i>

08:46.901 --> 08:49.612
Uh, you know how you said
this was a stupid idea?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.155
I think you might be right.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.075
Aha! So you admit it! Boom!

08:54.158 --> 08:56.702
Uh, I'm saying we're doomed.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.871
Ah, still taking the win.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.457
We're not doomed. Red'll save us.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.209
Yeah, Red's got this!

09:03.292 --> 09:05.962
Yeah. I totally don't got this.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.037
Aah!

09:47.253 --> 09:50.631
Guys, I'm really sorry I didn't get us
to Splashageddon.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.134
You should have listened to Stella
and not me.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.385
What are you talking about?

09:54.468 --> 09:57.221
Yeah, that was amazing. You're a genius!

09:57.305 --> 09:59.515
-I… I am?
-He is?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.059
Yeah, the way you made Bomb
panic and explode,

10:02.143 --> 10:06.105
causing the lake to drain us into
the most epic water slide of all time!

10:06.188 --> 10:08.983
Not to mention
all the great digging I got to do,

10:09.066 --> 10:11.193
and Stella got to surf lava!

10:12.737 --> 10:15.156
Well, this is a surprise!

10:15.239 --> 10:17.950
Everything's sparkling!

10:19.577 --> 10:23.289
Huh. Guess Chuck and Bomb are right.
You did come through in the end.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.458
Thanks, Stella.
Guess I am pretty awesome.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.002
-Red! Red! Red! Red! Red!
-Hmph!

10:29.462 --> 10:31.339
Whoo, ha ha ha!

10:31.422 --> 10:33.382
Yahoo!

10:35.384 --> 10:39.263
See? I told you we make it
to Splashageddon, <i>mes amis.</i>
