It's Kylie. How did I know
you wouldn't pick up?

Working out? Isn't it
a little early for that?

00:46.212 --> 00:49.047
Ah, warming up
with a morning jog,

a better man than me.

Uh, I was just calling

I know how much you love change.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.726
Why not take a trip outside
of your comfort zone,

I want to see something

flags and medals on the walls.

- General Cabot!

so it's just Henry now.
- You still heading up the
school board at Stone Creek?

having a two-star general

Makes them look legit.

So... when did you
get your marching papers?

Mortar shell blew.

Shrapnel flew,

very yogurt and granola.

Foster, example's important

and punctuality's
a part of the code.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.068

10:53.069 --> 10:55.320
the cadets here
the benefits of yoga.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.697
Studies show it helps

11:06.582 --> 11:08.166
Shall we?

Anyway, I'm sure you've

11:15.299 --> 11:17.509
Oh, you mean the General.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.011

you two served together.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.347
I suppose old habits
must die hard.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.058
- If they die at all.
- Right.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.810
Well, that's why
I was brought on here,

11:26.811 --> 11:29.813
to help make the Academy more
relevant to a new demographic.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.648
- What was wrong with
the old demographic?

11:31.649 --> 11:35.527
- Parents don't care about the
pomp and circumstance anymore.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.530
No offense. They just want
schools like Stone Creek

11:38.531 --> 11:40.365
to get their kids
into good colleges.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.700
- Well, I was brought in
to emphasize code of conduct,

11:42.701 --> 11:45.703
character development,
discipline. I mean,
look at this campus.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.789
It's the cadets' responsibility
to treat their institution

11:47.790 --> 11:49.874
with respect. And how
are they supposed to do that

11:49.875 --> 11:52.252
with their noses
buried in cellphones?

11:52.253 --> 11:55.630
On that subject, we're banning
electronic devices from campus.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.841
- Are you serious?

11:57.842 --> 12:01.261
You realize the students
do their homework online?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.805
Look, I don't necessarily
disagree with everything

12:03.806 --> 12:06.724
you're saying, but I also
don't see how your approach

12:06.725 --> 12:09.394

to turn this place around.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.314
- Do you have a better idea?
- Thank you, Colonel.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.275
That's the first time you've
asked me for my opinion.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.778
- Sorry, ma'am. You will find
I call 'em like I see 'em.

12:18.779 --> 12:22.240
- Well, it's very easy to walk
in here, pointing fingers.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.409
I've only had a few weeks to
settle in and you've had, what,

12:24.410 --> 12:27.245
a few hours? Meet the faculty.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.080
Get to know the cadets.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.916
Take a deeper look around
and then come to me with a plan

12:31.917 --> 12:34.961
we can actually discuss.
Got it, Colonel?

12:34.962 --> 12:37.672
- Yes, ma'am.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.176
- Great.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.514

unusual punishment

12:46.515 --> 12:48.433
that no one should
be subjected to.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.311
- It's not that bad. It's got
the four major food groups:

12:51.312 --> 12:54.272
beef, turkey, ham, cheese.
- Yeah, I'm not talking about

12:54.273 --> 12:56.357
your protein explosion.
I'm talking about

12:56.358 --> 12:58.860
your "my way or
the highway" attitude.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.862
Like it or not, Dad,
this woman is still your boss.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.822
- Technically, we're in charge
of two separate divisions.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.784
- Well, it sounds to me like
she's trying to work with you.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.661
- Right. By dismissing

13:08.662 --> 13:10.830
everything the
Academy represents.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.625
- You are so frustrating. Why do
you think you're the only person

13:13.626 --> 13:15.960
who knows how to do things?
- Maybe I am...

13:15.961 --> 13:18.338
- Maybe you're not!

13:18.339 --> 13:20.256
Can I make a suggestion?

13:20.257 --> 13:21.841
- Like me saying no
would make a difference.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.594
- Put the dimmer switch
on that personality of yours.

13:24.595 --> 13:28.973
Daddy, don't get me wrong.
I love you to bits.

13:28.974 --> 13:33.270
But you have a way of making
everyone the enemy sometimes.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.067
- I don't mean to.
- Well, look at you,

13:39.068 --> 13:41.986
taking baby steps.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.155
You could do that
more often, too.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.324
Smile?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.993
It's not a weakness to show
you have a softer side.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.496
- Well, I'll give you that.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.917
Your mom had a way of
getting me to lower my guard.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.585
- Well, now that she's gone,

13:57.586 --> 14:00.338
maybe you have to learn
how to do that for yourself.

14:00.339 --> 14:05.678
Or find someone new
to help you do it.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.602
And up goes that guard again.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.908
- Uh... standby colours.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.078
♪♪

14:46.176 --> 14:48.304
- Attention!

14:51.932 --> 14:54.309
Some of you look like
you just rolled out of bed.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.935
- No, sir.

14:55.936 --> 14:59.022
- Can somebody explain to me why
nobody's heart is in their duty?

14:59.023 --> 15:03.067
When I was your age, we had
to earn this privilege.
- When was that? Vietnam?

15:03.068 --> 15:06.029
- That's it, hero. Give me 20.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.948
- Sorry. I don't get
my allowance until Friday.

15:08.949 --> 15:12.661
- Push-ups! That's everybody,
on the ground. Let's go!

15:16.123 --> 15:19.585
Come on. Let's go, let's go!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.921
You can thank Cadet
Keller. Real push-ups.

15:23.922 --> 15:26.883
- Nothing like starting the day
with a little calisthenics.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.469
Is that it, Colonel Brennan?
- Something like that.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.596
The cadets and I are
just getting acquainted.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.598
- Good, because
some of these cadets

15:33.599 --> 15:36.017
are the Academy's
top scholars, like Emily

15:36.018 --> 15:39.771
and Jared. And Mason here
actually just skipped a grade.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.273
- The wise guy?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.108
Flat backs!

15:44.109 --> 15:46.611
Knees on the ground,
if you have to.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.406
Dean, it's traditional to refer
to cadets by their last name.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.575
- Oh, I don't know.
I find that so impersonal.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.412
Don't you? I'm actually trying
to get them to call me Caroline.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.290
I mean, that is my name.
Right, cadets?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.959
- OK, that's enough.
On your feet.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.464
Get to class, cadets.
Walk with me.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.678
Two things. First:
I would appreciate it

16:11.679 --> 16:13.554
if you didn't contradict me
in front of the cadets.

16:13.555 --> 16:18.142
And secondly: how far
can you walk in those?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.771
- Watch me.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.315
For enrollment to grow,
I plan on implementing

16:24.316 --> 16:26.651
progressive teaching methods
that worked at my last job:

16:26.652 --> 16:30.363
expanded learning tracks,
life skills courses,

16:30.364 --> 16:33.324
flipped classrooms...
- What's a flipped classroom?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.827
Never mind.
- We're not in the business

16:35.828 --> 16:38.621
of creating soldiers. We're
supposed to be shaping minds.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.998
- Precisely, and if you truly
understood the military model,

16:40.999 --> 16:43.334
you would see that discipline
fosters a great work ethic

16:43.335 --> 16:46.003
that carries over into every
aspect of a cadet's life.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.172
- And if I respectfully
disagree, what?

16:48.173 --> 16:50.049
Are you going to tell me
to drop and give you 20?

16:50.050 --> 16:52.719
- If I thought it would help.
- Look, I may not know much

16:52.720 --> 16:54.846
about the military,
but I do get kids.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.056
I know what keeps them
motivated to succeed.

16:57.057 --> 17:01.018
But I can't do it alone and
I also... can't climb this hill.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.731
- Now there's a word I hate:
"can't." It's the most overused

17:04.732 --> 17:07.233
word in the English language.
It's just another word for quit.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.027
- Is that so?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.529
You said, "I can't climb
this hill." Yes, you can.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.906
Do your feet hurt?
Sure, but you can climb.

17:13.906 --> 17:16.032
"Can't" suggests it's out
of your power. It's not.

17:16.034 --> 17:19.662
- Fine! How about this?
I'm not climbing this hill

17:19.663 --> 17:23.416
in these shoes.
- Better. That's a choice.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.797
- I really CAN'T stand that man.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.183
♪♪

18:12.591 --> 18:15.843
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.513
- Yes. Can you see
if Dean Foster's

18:18.514 --> 18:20.431
available for
a meeting after lunch?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.350
- You mean here,
in the war room?

18:22.351 --> 18:25.561
I mean, your office?

18:25.562 --> 18:27.815
- Dean's choice.

18:34.279 --> 18:39.535
- She says she can meet you out
on the quad, 1:30 to 1:45ish.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.207
"Ish" means
somewhere in between.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.295
- I am familiar with
the term. But tell me,

18:51.296 --> 18:53.214
at what point does
"ish" just become

18:53.215 --> 18:55.299
a blatant disregard
for a time commitment?

18:55.300 --> 18:58.303
- I'd give it
around a half hour.

19:00.138 --> 19:03.058
- Good to know.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.022
On time, I see.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.024
- Actually, I got here
a few minutes early,

19:12.025 --> 19:14.485
in case you were
planning to blitzkrieg.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.321
- Perfect. I love a walk
and talk. Only this time,

19:17.322 --> 19:20.408
it's not a competition.
I have a game plan

19:20.409 --> 19:23.077
I'd like to run by you.
- What's the catch?

19:23.078 --> 19:25.830
- There's no catch. We both
want the same thing, right?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.707
- Well, that depends.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.209
You sometimes seem
a little bit resistant

19:30.210 --> 19:34.297
to anybody's ideas but your own.
- Well, people can change.

19:34.298 --> 19:38.342
If they... want to.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.219
- Hopefully a little more easily

19:40.220 --> 19:43.347
than those words coming
out of your mouth.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.809
- So I've looked around and
my first impression still holds.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.686
We need to reembrace
conduct codes

19:48.687 --> 19:51.480
and enhance levels of respect
and confidence to up our game.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.524
- I'm glad to see
you're still sticking

19:53.525 --> 19:55.526
with your original opinion.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.361
You're consistent,
I'll give you that.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.615
- Ma'am, you gotta let me
finish. Which leads to
reinvigorating the school's

20:00.616 --> 20:02.617
junior ROTC program,
which parents love

20:02.618 --> 20:04.994
because of the financial
assistance. It appeals

20:04.995 --> 20:07.538
to graduates for college.
- Ambitious. Do not quote me

20:07.539 --> 20:10.374
on this, but I like
the way you think.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.335
- Well, it's not
flipping houses,

20:12.336 --> 20:14.295
but it's an idea
to put us on the map.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.255
- Flipped classrooms,
which simply means

20:16.256 --> 20:19.133
watching class lectures at home
and doing homework in class.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.177
- Doesn't that
make it classwork?

20:21.178 --> 20:24.180
- Listen. I happen to believe
that a more personal approach

20:24.181 --> 20:27.141
to learning can be just
as effective, if not more,

20:27.142 --> 20:29.685
than your take-no-
prisoners attitude.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.646
- Dean, you have
to understand in battle,

20:31.647 --> 20:33.731
an individual is only
as strong as his unit.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.733
- We are not
in battle right now.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.568
- We're always in battle, ma'am.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.612
And for the record,
your approach sounds like

20:39.613 --> 20:42.198
a coddling load of psychobabble.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.908
- Psychobabble?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.243
You know what, Colonel?
We're done here.

20:46.244 --> 20:49.080
And to think that I actually
complimented you on your ideas.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.332
- Idea. I had more, but you
didn't let me get to them.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.709
- Well, that's because the only
way you know how to share them

20:53.710 --> 20:55.670
is by barking them
out like orders.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.797
You know what? I guess
it's true what they say.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.507
Old soldiers never die...

20:59.508 --> 21:03.178
or know when to keep their
ears open and mouths shut.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.521
- The woman won't listen
to common sense.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.773
- She's not the enemy, Tom.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.943
You need to find
a middle ground with her.

21:18.944 --> 21:23.198
- Yeah, well, preferably
in a different zip code.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.368
- There's something
you ought to know.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.663
I hate bringing it up,
'cause it might not even happen,

21:30.664 --> 21:32.665
but it might get you to
start thinking differently

21:32.666 --> 21:35.418
about your approach. There's
talk that Bremner College

21:35.419 --> 21:38.963
is going to buy the Academy
and tear it down to build
a dormitory complex.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.756
- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

21:40.757 --> 21:44.385
- You're gonna let that happen?
- No one's letting anything
happen. But at the end

21:44.386 --> 21:46.345
of the day, my ranking
means nothing to a bunch of

21:46.346 --> 21:49.557
30-something board members who
only salute to the bottom line.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.267
- What do I do?

21:51.268 --> 21:54.311
- Convince them the place
is worth keeping.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.647
Increasing enrollment
would be a great start,

21:56.648 --> 21:58.566
but you need to do it quickly.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.486
- Why do I feel like the
captain of a sinking ship?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.658
- So by giving cadets a choice

22:07.659 --> 22:09.618
of watching lectures
at their leisure,

22:09.619 --> 22:12.538
in-class time can be
devoted to exercises,

22:12.539 --> 22:14.749
projects or discussions.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.876
Yes, Pete? Do you
have something to add?

22:16.877 --> 22:20.379
- Caroline, while I do think
some of your ideas are bold,

22:20.380 --> 22:23.257
I'm not sure any of this is
going to be the fix you need

22:23.258 --> 22:26.260
to turn this academy around.
- I agree. Look.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.596
The scholastics program
can always be improved,

22:28.597 --> 22:30.556
but that's not what's
ailing this academy.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.059
- So what do you think
the problem is, Jennifer?

22:33.060 --> 22:35.770
- Well, it seems like
no one really cares anymore.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.064
- Everyone's been getting away
with doing a little less

22:38.065 --> 22:40.733
and a little less
and it starts to snowball.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.069
- It wasn't always that way.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.030
When I started here, there
was a pride in the Academy

22:46.031 --> 22:49.033
and everything
it stood for: duty,

22:49.034 --> 22:53.370
honour, courage.
- Yes, we've heard.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.914
And now?

22:54.915 --> 22:57.166
- It doesn't take
a mathematician to figure

22:57.167 --> 23:00.002
our current class
sizes won't translate

23:00.003 --> 23:02.421
into a sustainable business.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.215
- Look. With all the cutbacks
and the rumours that the school

23:04.216 --> 23:06.217
is going under, we all
figure that the Academy's

23:06.218 --> 23:10.054
days are numbered.
- And you're all OK with that?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.056
Sorry, just curious.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.974
- No, none of us want this place

23:13.975 --> 23:17.979
to go out with a whimper,
but what can we do?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.609

23:23.610 --> 23:25.946

First untucked shirts,

Do you mind explaining
this to me, hero?

the covers over it!

23:56.476 --> 23:58.602
- You consider this made?

23:58.603 --> 24:00.813
You should be able to bounce
a quarter off this thing.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.692
- I told you, I don't get
my allowance until Friday.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.196
- I'll show you how
to properly make a bed.

24:09.197 --> 24:12.701
Watch me and do what I do.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.206
You actually have no idea why
this is important, do you?

24:19.207 --> 24:24.503
It's about order, consistency,
attention to detail.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.714
- If you say so, sir.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.509
- Get your coat.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.722
- Wait. You're not going to make
me do push-ups again, are you?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.765
- Actually...

24:36.766 --> 24:39.351
I need your help.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.854
I'm trying to find out
what you and the other cadets

24:41.855 --> 24:43.772
think about the Academy.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.983
So you'll have permission
to speak freely.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.862
- Exactly how freely?

24:50.488 --> 24:53.782
Personally, I think
most cadets see Stone Creek

24:53.783 --> 24:55.826
as a place for parents
to send their slackers.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.953
- I beg your pardon?
- Kids with disciplinary

24:57.954 --> 25:00.915
problems. You know, hoping the
Academy will straighten 'em out.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.834
- I see.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.378
Anybody I might know
that fits that description?

25:06.379 --> 25:09.590
- No, sir. None that
I know of personally.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.759
- OK.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.178
Tell me, cadet. When was
the last time the school

25:14.179 --> 25:17.140
had an honours ceremony?
- What's that?

25:18.516 --> 25:21.435
- It's a ceremony that honours
cadets who have demonstrated

25:21.436 --> 25:25.272
exemplary performance.
It features elaborate drills,

25:25.273 --> 25:27.066
parades, dress formals...

25:27.067 --> 25:29.860
when I was a cadet, the backbone
of any military academy.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.363
- I don't know. Guess they
phased that stuff out

25:32.364 --> 25:34.949
after you went here
back in the 60s.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.451
- I appreciate
your honesty, cadet,

25:37.452 --> 25:40.663
but it was actually the mid-80s.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.833
Permission to speak
freely is now revoked.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.057
- You know, watching yoga
is only half as much fun

26:00.058 --> 26:02.559
as practicing it.
- How did you know I was here?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.771
- Because whenever you're
around me, a 21-gun salute

26:05.772 --> 26:07.983
goes off in my head.

26:09.693 --> 26:13.655
Great job, cadets.
I'll see you same time tomorrow.

26:16.032 --> 26:19.243
- If you're up for the
challenge, I thought maybe...

26:19.244 --> 26:20.995
maybe we could try this again.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.914
- Should I get my boxing
gloves now, or...?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.874
- You might be
surprised to hear this,

26:25.875 --> 26:28.211
but I'm actually easygoing.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.715
- About an easygoing
as an avalanche.

26:32.716 --> 26:36.427
- Try me.
- OK.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.929
So you really think
what's ailing this academy

26:38.930 --> 26:41.765
could be solved with
your military approach?

26:41.766 --> 26:44.143
- I did, but you were right

26:44.144 --> 26:47.604
to ask me to take
a deeper look around.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.524
What?
- You just said I was right.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.319
Forgive me for basking
in a little glory.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.488
- Well, don't bask too long.

26:56.489 --> 26:59.241
The board is talking
about closing the Academy.

26:59.242 --> 27:02.369
- So the rumours are true.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.788
How much time do we have?
- We'll finish the school year

27:04.789 --> 27:07.666
for sure, but the deal
could be sealed before that,

27:07.667 --> 27:11.086
which is why you and I have
to find a way to work together.

27:11.087 --> 27:14.298
- Agreed. As long as you promise

27:14.299 --> 27:16.675
to not bark out ideas
like I'm your subordinate.

27:16.676 --> 27:20.054
- Roger that. I just ask
that you keep an open mind

27:20.055 --> 27:22.222
about a more
traditional approach.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.600
- I'm Zen with that.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.352
- Really?

27:26.353 --> 27:28.812
- Why do you look so surprised?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.814
- Well, you might not be aware,

27:30.815 --> 27:32.941
but you can
be tough to work with.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.820
- Me?

27:38.073 --> 27:41.284
♪♪

27:59.886 --> 28:01.971
♪♪

28:32.710 --> 28:35.379
Good morning, Mel.
- Morning, Caroline.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.715
Coffee's just brewed.
- Oh, thank you.

28:38.716 --> 28:42.177
I suspect today's going
to be one of those days,

28:42.178 --> 28:44.930
so do me a favour
and supersize me.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.391
- Oh, if you're hungry,

28:47.392 --> 28:49.935
I made something
different today.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.937
Egg white sausage cupcakes.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.731
I'm hoping to find
a fan with the Colonel.

28:54.732 --> 28:57.985
- Ooh. All protein, low-fat.
I bet you've got a winner.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.446
Uh, hi. I'm Kylie.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.907
- You're Tom's daughter.
So glad to meet you.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.493
- Wow, he lets you call him Tom!

29:06.494 --> 29:10.038
- Not exactly. We've yet
to broker a treaty on names.

29:10.039 --> 29:12.458
Trying to
pick my battles wisely.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.253
- Smart. I think I was 9 before
he even let me call him Dad.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.130
- What?

29:18.131 --> 29:22.051
- Just kidding.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.440
- So sir, is it true?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.442
You were in the Gulf War?

29:38.443 --> 29:41.612
- One of the many places
I was deployed, yes.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.616
- I heard you were the youngest
lieutenant in Operation
Desert Shield.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.160
And stayed right through
the invasion of Kuwait?

29:48.161 --> 29:50.120
That had to be epic, huh?

29:50.121 --> 29:52.831
- I wouldn't say epic, but...
definitely an experience.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.751
Where'd you learn all this?
- There's this thing called

29:55.752 --> 29:58.128
the internet... sir.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.088
- Well, why are you
asking me questions?

30:00.089 --> 30:02.132
If you read it on the internet,
it must be true, right?

30:02.133 --> 30:04.343
- I meant no disrespect, sir.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.803
I was just curious
after our discussion.

30:06.804 --> 30:10.307
See, I did some
research on Stone Creek.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.643
- OK.
- Did you know two generals

30:12.644 --> 30:15.312
from World War II were former
graduates of the Academy?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.648
One of them even served on
the board before he took over

30:17.649 --> 30:19.441
the superintendent
post at Westpoint.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.818
- Didn't realize you
were such a history buff.

30:21.819 --> 30:24.279
- What was this place
like when you went here?

30:24.280 --> 30:26.824
- You mean during
the War of 1812?

30:28.868 --> 30:33.664
There was great pride
in being a Stone Creek cadet.

30:33.665 --> 30:38.418
We felt like we were a part of
something bigger than ourselves,

30:38.419 --> 30:40.379
that we could
accomplish anything

30:40.380 --> 30:43.840
if we set our mind to it.
- So do you think

30:43.841 --> 30:46.426
you can bring this place back
to the way it used to be?

30:46.427 --> 30:48.387
- I wouldn't
be here if I didn't.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.181
- That's cool.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.433
I mean, I'd like
to see that happen.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.519
- Really? That's
quite a turnaround

30:55.520 --> 30:57.896
from our earlier conversation.
Why the sudden change of heart?

30:57.897 --> 31:01.858
- Well, after that growth spurt
I've been waiting on kicks in,

31:01.859 --> 31:04.945
I was thinking about joining
the Air Force one day.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.822
- Really?

31:06.823 --> 31:10.200
Pretty impressive.
Future fly boy, eh?

31:10.201 --> 31:12.578
That's about the
toughest ticket in town.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.123
- Do you think I have
what it takes, sir?

31:19.085 --> 31:21.837
- My dad always said,
"You can attain

31:21.838 --> 31:24.631
anything you want in life
through perseverance."

31:24.632 --> 31:28.051
- You really believe that?
- I really do.

31:28.052 --> 31:32.390
You just need
the proper inspiration.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.061
Well, if you don't
want to get a tardy,

31:38.062 --> 31:40.397
you better hightail
it to class, hero.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.733
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.986
- Mm-hmm.

31:50.908 --> 31:53.952
- I didn't realize the Colonel
actually attended the Academy,

31:53.953 --> 31:58.624
but I'd recognize that
steely-eyed glare anywhere.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.585
- Oh, my goodness.
Look how cute he was.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.463
- I know! That's a picture

32:04.464 --> 32:07.090
of him with my mom.
That'd be on the night

32:07.091 --> 32:08.967
he finally mustered
the courage to ask her out.

32:08.968 --> 32:12.137
- Aw!
- You know, you look like her.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.764
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.892
- I miss hearing people say
that. It's hard to believe

32:16.893 --> 32:19.603
it's been almost three years
since she passed away.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.605
- Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.149
- Oh...
- I had no idea

32:24.150 --> 32:26.610
the Colonel was a widower.

32:26.611 --> 32:30.030
- So to what do
we owe the surprise?

32:30.031 --> 32:32.449
I thought you were studying
at Bremner College.

32:32.450 --> 32:36.119
- Uh, yeah. Yeah...

32:36.120 --> 32:39.206
Don't tell my dad,
but I took the day off.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.667
I think I'm having
a case of the June blues.

32:41.668 --> 32:45.128
- Look, Kylie, feel free to call
me and vent, if you like.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.963
Before I got
into administration,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.132
I spent four years
as a career counsellor.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.385
- Oh, really? So is that helping

32:51.386 --> 32:53.345
when it comes to butting
heads with my dad?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.681
- It's a day-by-day situation.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.517
- Sometimes, minute-by-minute.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.729
I thought I heard your voice.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.525
What's going on in here?
- Oh, didn't you get the memo?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.568
It's Bring Your
Daughter to Work Day.

33:08.569 --> 33:13.073
- Um, Kylie, I'm afraid you
picked sort of a bad time.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.283
We're kind of in the throes
of it here. I've got a big

33:15.284 --> 33:17.994
strategy meeting with the boss.
- Oh, I prefer the term

33:17.995 --> 33:20.789
"superior officer."
- Yeah, no, I totally

33:20.790 --> 33:23.875
understand. I just came by
to say hi, see your office...

33:23.876 --> 33:26.712
- Oh, I can show it to you.
It's not very fancy, though.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.131
The Colonel here
doesn't like to decorate.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.926
- OK, let's go!
- OK, let's go.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.222
I like her.

33:37.223 --> 33:40.600
- Kylie is a lovely girl.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.811
You should be very proud.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.105
- Well, I can't take all the
credit. Her mother did most

33:45.106 --> 33:47.691
of the heavy lifting.
- I think Kylie would disagree.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.820
You can tell just by
the way she looks at you.

33:54.782 --> 33:59.202
- Um, well, you ready
to start brainstorming?

33:59.203 --> 34:02.290
- Let's get this party started.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.714
I think the key
to increasing enrollment

34:10.715 --> 34:13.382
is raising morale internally,
but also changing

34:13.384 --> 34:15.302
the community's
perception of the Academy.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.053
- I couldn't agree more,
but the question is

34:17.054 --> 34:19.097
how do we accomplish that
in the shortest amount of time?

34:19.098 --> 34:21.641
- Well, that's our challenge,
which got me thinking

34:21.641 --> 34:23.685
about the homecoming dance.
- Well, that might stir

34:23.686 --> 34:25.896
some interest among cadets, but
I doubt it'll blip on the radar

34:25.897 --> 34:29.274
with the board members.
- You didn't let me finish.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.943
Hey. Hey.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.154
- Beg your pardon.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.699
That's military speak for,
"I'm sorry. Please continue."

34:37.699 --> 34:41.578
- Thank you. This year,
the Academy turns 100,

34:41.579 --> 34:43.496
which got me thinking,

34:43.498 --> 34:46.081
why don't we host
a huge centennial benefit

34:46.083 --> 34:49.960
at Scholar Hall instead?
- Ah, gotcha.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.088
Bring out some alumni,
get a lot of free press.

34:52.089 --> 34:54.257
- Let's make it a celebration
that honours the school

34:54.257 --> 34:58.011
as well as the community. And
let's give the board a reason

34:58.012 --> 35:01.264
not to tear the Academy down.
- I like it.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.434
- You like it,
but you don't love it?

35:04.435 --> 35:06.561
- Don't get me wrong. I like
where you're headed. I just...

35:06.562 --> 35:08.271
I don't think
it goes far enough.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.609
- I'm sensing a "yet"
in my future.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.284
I get it. This is all
very impressive.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.203
- Honours ceremonies
are the lifeblood

35:23.204 --> 35:26.206
of any military academy.
And it's not just handing out

35:26.207 --> 35:29.251
ribbons and commendations,
it's what's behind them.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.169
- And what's that?
- Pride.

35:31.170 --> 35:34.089
Something this academy
is obviously sorely lacking.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.675
I mean, a centennial celebration
doesn't mean anything

35:36.676 --> 35:38.844
if there's nothing
behind it to celebrate.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.555
Remember, perception is reality.

35:41.556 --> 35:45.100
- And so is the bottom line.
I imagine this all comes

35:45.101 --> 35:47.727
with a pretty hefty
price tag. And remember,

35:47.728 --> 35:49.813
our goal is to find a way
to increase enrollment.

35:49.814 --> 35:53.275
- Exactly. And this...
this is the key.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.318
You don't know what
it feels like to earn

35:55.319 --> 35:58.363
the Dean's Superior
Leadership Award.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.908
- But you do.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.662
- The honours ceremony's
a culmination of academics

36:05.663 --> 36:10.041
and discipline. This, this will
give our cadets and the faculty

36:10.042 --> 36:12.419
something to believe in.
Work hard, earn the honour,

36:12.420 --> 36:14.379
the rest will follow.
I'm telling you,

36:14.380 --> 36:16.339
if we can pull this off,
every parent out there

36:16.340 --> 36:18.508
will be dying to send
their kid to Stone Creek.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.344
- I feel your passion
and I agree with you.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.638
This could all be so incredible.

36:23.639 --> 36:27.018
- I'm sensing a "but"
in my future.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.776
- Uh, oh. Somebody
doesn't look happy.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.195
- How am I supposed to save
a school when there's not enough

36:39.196 --> 36:42.073
money in the budget
to afford a pencil eraser?

36:42.074 --> 36:45.243
- Well, hopefully,
it's nothing a little beef stew

36:45.244 --> 36:48.705
won't take the edge off.
- What's going on?

36:48.706 --> 36:51.875
Why are you trying to butter
me up with my favourite meal?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.877
You are not
switching majors again.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.546
- OK, will you relax?
Maybe I just wanted

36:56.547 --> 37:00.259
a little father-daughter time.

37:05.306 --> 37:08.351
- Well, then, why are there
three plates at the table?

37:22.907 --> 37:25.533
Dean Foster.
- Hi.

37:25.534 --> 37:28.245
- Oh, come in.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.624
- Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.335
- Are you kidding?
I welcomed a hot meal

37:35.336 --> 37:38.713
after the cold shoulder
I got this afternoon.

37:38.714 --> 37:41.091
- It wasn't that cold and
it wasn't directed at you.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.426
I'm just frustrated
with the situation.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.221
- I know. Welcome to my anxiety.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.516
Speaking of which, this bottle
is not going to open itself,

37:49.517 --> 37:51.977
Colonel.
- Tom.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.979
That's your name!
You might as well start

37:53.980 --> 37:56.773
letting people use it.
You'll have to forgive

37:56.774 --> 37:58.775
my father. He's not
used to entertaining.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.528
Or mixing business
with pleasure. Actually,

38:01.529 --> 38:05.408
he hasn't really figured
out the pleasure part yet.
- Would you like to come in?

38:08.911 --> 38:12.330
- I like what you haven't
done with the place.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.001
- I know. I guess it's the
offshoot of living in barracks

38:16.002 --> 38:18.878
for so long. I tend
to keep things sparse.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.464
Old habits die hard.
- I heard.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.175
If they die at all.

38:24.176 --> 38:27.595
At least you didn't paint
the outside camouflage.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.806
- Oh, no.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.225
I have to go back
to campus. My roommate,

38:32.226 --> 38:34.811
she's locked herself
out of our dorm.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.147
I'm so sorry. You know what?

38:37.148 --> 38:41.943
You guys eat, I'll go,
I'll come back as soon as I can.

38:41.944 --> 38:44.487
- Wait. You can't
leave me here with her.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.656
What do you expect me to do?

38:46.657 --> 38:49.701
- I don't know!
Listen to your guest?

38:49.702 --> 38:52.537
That wine isn't pouring itself.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.457
Bye, Caroline.
- Bye!

38:55.458 --> 38:58.043
Have fun!

38:58.044 --> 39:01.047
Just be charming, will ya?

39:04.508 --> 39:08.303
- So I take it my idea to
revive the honours ceremony

39:08.304 --> 39:10.555
is off the table.

39:10.556 --> 39:14.517
- No, it could still be on it,

39:14.518 --> 39:17.938
if only you had one.

39:19.899 --> 39:23.026
No, it's all about
weighing our options

39:23.027 --> 39:24.944
and deciding on the
best course of action.

39:24.945 --> 39:28.531
- But because you're the dean,
it's ultimately your decision.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.950
- That's true.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.535
But remember, we said
that we would work together.

39:32.536 --> 39:36.164
I know you're from a world
of leaders and followers,

39:36.165 --> 39:38.083
but for me, there needs to be

39:38.084 --> 39:40.460
a yin and yang in order
to create harmony.

39:40.461 --> 39:43.004
- I see. Right brain
versus left brain.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.465
But which one of us
has the right brain?

39:45.466 --> 39:47.635
- Time will tell.

39:49.136 --> 39:51.054
- What made you decide
to be an English major?

39:51.055 --> 39:55.558
I imagined you having
hippie artist parents

39:55.559 --> 39:58.770
who encouraged you
to chase rainbows.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.231
- Not exactly.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.566
You know the photo of that guy

40:03.567 --> 40:06.861
sticking daisies into rifles
of national guardsmen in protest

40:06.862 --> 40:09.072
of the Vietnam War?
- Yeah, the guy in the sweater.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.907
Don't tell me that was your dad?

40:10.908 --> 40:13.243
- No! No, but my dad was there

40:13.244 --> 40:16.121
the day that that photo was
taken. And that inspired him

40:16.122 --> 40:19.249
to become a war
photo journalist.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.000
And my mother
was a schoolteacher.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.045
My father respected the men
who fought for our country

40:24.046 --> 40:26.172
as well as the citizens
who objected to it.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.925
- Sounds like a very
brave and wise man.

40:28.926 --> 40:32.554
- Yeah, I wish I got
to know him a little better,

40:32.555 --> 40:35.473
but he died over Hanoi
when I was two years old.

40:35.474 --> 40:37.767
- Oh, sorry.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.270
- It's silly, really.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.441
How is it I manage to miss
a man I barely remember?

40:44.442 --> 40:47.735
- Some scars run
deeper than others.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.529
I think

40:49.530 --> 40:53.325
maybe they serve to remind us
how much the people meant to us.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.290
- Kylie told me.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.751
I'm very sorry
to hear about your wife.

41:10.759 --> 41:13.471
I'm curious.

41:16.515 --> 41:20.059
What's with the F. Scott
Fitzgerald quotation?

41:20.060 --> 41:23.563
He is a true
literary hero of mine.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.940
- Just the notion that we never
stop pursuing our goals,

41:25.941 --> 41:27.901
no matter what
life throws at us.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.736
- Nothing's impossible
till you say it is.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.781
- Now you're
speaking my language.
- Tom, I have been speaking it

41:33.782 --> 41:35.825
all along.

41:35.826 --> 41:39.787
I can't believe
I just called you Tom.

41:39.788 --> 41:42.707
Is that OK?

41:42.708 --> 41:45.210
- It's fine. Hooah.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.670
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, that's a...

41:47.671 --> 41:49.797
military expression.
It comes from an acronym:

41:49.798 --> 41:52.842
heard, understood,
acknowledged. HUA.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.345
- OK. So it's a good thing?

41:55.346 --> 41:58.349
- Yeah, it's a very good thing.

42:01.810 --> 42:06.440
- To never giving up.
- To never giving up.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.367
- Forward march!

42:34.134 --> 42:36.135
Come on, guys.
You heard the Colonel.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.179
This is supposed
to be an honour.

42:38.180 --> 42:42.684
- Alright, Emily.
Let's see some enthusiasm.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.812
- Standby!

42:46.772 --> 42:48.816
Colours!

43:01.870 --> 43:03.998
- Melanie?

43:05.916 --> 43:07.959
- Yes.
- Kylie called. This must

43:07.960 --> 43:10.670
be for the Colonel, no?
- Actually, she wanted

43:10.671 --> 43:13.715
to talk to you. I guess
she wants to take you up

43:13.716 --> 43:17.593
on your guidance
counsellor offer.
- Aw.

43:17.594 --> 43:19.679
- Before you go, I know the
Colonel wants to speak with you.

43:19.680 --> 43:23.641
- You know what? I just really
need to clear my mind first.

43:23.642 --> 43:26.352
- You already had your one
yoga class this afternoon.

43:26.353 --> 43:28.688
- Oh, no. There is not
a downward dog deep enough

43:28.689 --> 43:32.567
to clear what I have
off my mind. Tell you what.

43:32.568 --> 43:36.904
Tell Tom he can meet me
here later, if he wants.

43:36.905 --> 43:39.408
Thank you.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.454
- "Tom"?

43:44.455 --> 43:47.082
♪♪

44:18.697 --> 44:21.158
- Sleeves, cadet.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.707
Melanie, do you have any
idea where Dean Foster is?

44:29.708 --> 44:32.210
- As a matter of fact,
I do. She said

44:32.211 --> 44:36.964
you should meet her there
anytime after 1800 hours.

44:36.965 --> 44:39.926
That's 6:00.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.179
- I'm well aware.

44:55.901 --> 44:57.902
Since when do you play pool?

44:57.903 --> 45:00.697
- Since when do you ask?

45:02.366 --> 45:04.867
I picked up the game in college.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.661
Sometimes, I even
got lucky enough

45:06.662 --> 45:08.704
to win a little weekend funny
money playing pool at the decks.

45:08.705 --> 45:11.707
- Funny money?
30 years in the service,

45:11.708 --> 45:14.502
I've played a little myself.
- Really?

45:14.503 --> 45:17.964
Maybe you should break.
- You sure?

45:17.965 --> 45:21.135
- Be my guest.

45:31.228 --> 45:34.731
- Don't judge. I've got a bum
shoulder from a war injury.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.569
- I might know a pose or two
that would stretch that out,

45:39.570 --> 45:43.030
if you were willing
to open your mind to yoga.

45:43.031 --> 45:45.658
Corner pocket.

45:45.659 --> 45:49.078
- Maybe you're right. But what
about opening your mind?

45:49.079 --> 45:51.497
- To what?
- Your belief that my way

45:51.498 --> 45:54.459
of turning the Academy around
means teaching all the cadets

45:54.460 --> 45:57.670
to be mini soldiers.
That's not what it's about.

45:57.671 --> 46:00.673
- OK, enlighten me.

46:00.674 --> 46:03.259
Side pocket.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.137
- The Academy was built
on a military model

46:06.138 --> 46:08.431
because it teaches
self-discipline, confidence,

46:08.432 --> 46:10.767
leadership skills.
- Great! But what about things

46:10.768 --> 46:13.728
like individuality,
self-expression, creativity?

46:13.729 --> 46:15.605
- One doesn't
preclude the other.

46:15.606 --> 46:17.815
If a cadet will
pay attention to details

46:17.816 --> 46:20.860
like shining his shoes or making
sure his bed is squared away,

46:20.861 --> 46:23.946
he'll also go the extra mile
to redo that math equation

46:23.947 --> 46:25.948
or reread that
Shakespearian sonnet

46:25.949 --> 46:29.369
to make sure he understands it.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.793
What? Nothing?

46:37.794 --> 46:40.922
- I never thought about it
that way before, Tom.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.175
You're right.

46:44.968 --> 46:47.929
Now it's your turn
to bask in the glory.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.847
Feels good, doesn't it?

46:49.848 --> 46:52.183
- Feel better if it would
revive the honours ceremony.

46:52.184 --> 46:55.478
If I had 60 grand in
the budget for dress uniforms.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.480
- I'm afraid that kitty is dry.

46:57.481 --> 46:59.565
I barely scrounged up
enough funds

46:59.566 --> 47:02.611
to cover the
expense of the gala.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.323
- So it's impossible?
- Nothing's impossible.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.910
What ever happened to all that
stuff about "never give up"

47:10.911 --> 47:13.497
and "a soldier is born ready"?

47:14.998 --> 47:16.916
- Why do I feel
like I'm being taken?

47:16.917 --> 47:19.335
- We haven't betted anything
yet. Come on, soldier.

47:19.336 --> 47:22.213
Put your thinking cap on.
- We have to change the culture

47:22.214 --> 47:24.924
and a renewed sense of pride
would improve academics,

47:24.925 --> 47:28.302
the perception of the community
and thus, donations.

47:28.303 --> 47:30.179
- Everyone loves a cause.

47:30.180 --> 47:33.016
- Especially one
worth fighting for.

47:36.645 --> 47:39.146
Change the whole
perception of the Academy

47:39.147 --> 47:41.023
and up goes enrollment.
- I love it!

47:41.024 --> 47:43.859
Now the only question is whether
I can manage to raise the money

47:43.860 --> 47:47.196
for the gala and you can
whip the cadets into shape

47:47.197 --> 47:49.198
in time for a true
honours ceremony.

47:49.199 --> 47:52.034
- Wait, seriously?
We can do both?

47:52.035 --> 47:56.080
We have a deal?
- Sure...

47:56.081 --> 47:59.041
if I can sink this shot.

47:59.042 --> 48:03.045
- Wait! I am not staking
the future of the Academy

48:03.046 --> 48:05.548
on one shot.
- You expect me

48:05.549 --> 48:09.177
to have faith in you.
How about a little faith in me?

48:11.096 --> 48:13.890
- Fine. Take the shot.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.403
Did it go in?

48:28.280 --> 48:31.199
- Hooyah.

48:34.953 --> 48:37.288
- Well, I have to admit,
I haven't been hustled like that

48:37.289 --> 48:40.417
in a long time, Caroline.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.753
What?

48:43.754 --> 48:47.007
- That's the first time
you've called me Caroline.

48:48.508 --> 48:52.219
- Is that OK?
- It's better than Dean Foster.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.347
Or ma'am.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.265
- OK. Well, Caroline,

48:56.266 --> 48:59.143
I've been meaning
to say that dinner

48:59.144 --> 49:01.145
the other night was fun.

49:01.146 --> 49:03.981
I mean, I had a good time.

49:03.982 --> 49:07.443
I haven't felt
like that in a while.

49:07.444 --> 49:10.279
- I had a nice time too.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.281
- Well, good, then maybe
we should do it again.

49:12.282 --> 49:14.659
I mean, if you're
up for the idea.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.328
- Are you asking me
out on a date?

49:17.329 --> 49:18.996
- I guess I am.

49:18.997 --> 49:23.376
I'm sorry, it's been a quarter
century since I asked a girl out

49:23.377 --> 49:25.044
and I'm a little rusty.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.922
But yes, I would like
for us to go out on a date,

49:27.923 --> 49:31.801
a real date,
and see what happens.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.636
- What do you think
is gonna happen?

49:33.637 --> 49:37.139
- I'm not sure, but it cannot
be more awkward than
it is right now.

49:37.140 --> 49:40.267
- One can hope.

49:40.268 --> 49:43.062
Yes, Tom.

49:43.063 --> 49:45.314
It's a date.
- Hooah.

49:45.315 --> 49:48.275
- Hooyah.
- No, I said simply hooah.

49:48.276 --> 49:50.945
- That's what I said.
- No, you said "hooyah."

49:50.946 --> 49:52.655
Said it that way earlier too.
- No, I didn't!

49:52.656 --> 49:56.409
- Just say it for me again.
- Hooyah.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.746
There. I said it
right that time.

50:07.587 --> 50:10.548
- Six! Seven! Eight! Nine!

50:10.549 --> 50:13.802
Come on, Keller! Pick it up!

50:19.266 --> 50:22.144
Cadets! Fall in!

50:24.312 --> 50:26.690
Move, move, move!

50:29.192 --> 50:32.903
Colonel Brennan, sir.
- Mac.

50:32.904 --> 50:35.532
- Attention!

50:37.659 --> 50:41.078
- So cadets, I know
that Sergeant McAllister

50:41.079 --> 50:44.248
has informed you of our plan
to revive the honours ceremony

50:44.249 --> 50:46.417
here at Stone Creek.

50:46.418 --> 50:49.587
Formulating the plan
is the easy part.

50:49.588 --> 50:53.716
Executing it will
require diligence,

50:53.717 --> 50:58.262
persistence, determination.

50:58.263 --> 51:01.807
And we only have a short
time to reach our goal,

51:01.808 --> 51:03.809
so the Sergeant and
I are going to push you

51:03.810 --> 51:05.686
to master some elaborate drills

51:05.687 --> 51:07.563
that you'll need
for the ceremony.

51:07.564 --> 51:11.358
I'll also be assigning ranks,
including Battalion Commander.

51:11.359 --> 51:13.569
- That's why I recommend
you all be at your best!

51:13.570 --> 51:17.199
Cadets! Fall out!

51:25.290 --> 51:28.125
- Colonel, sir. If possible,

51:28.126 --> 51:31.003
I would like to be considered
for rank of Battalion Commander.

51:31.004 --> 51:33.506
- That's a lot
of responsibility.

51:33.507 --> 51:37.760
A position typically assigned
to seniors. You really think
you're up for the challenge?

51:37.761 --> 51:40.763
- Yes, sir. I just want
a chance to prove what I can do.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.015
- A big change from the young
man with the untucked shirt

51:43.016 --> 51:45.392
and the attitude.
- People can change, sir.

51:45.393 --> 51:48.855
They just need
the proper... inspiration.

51:50.607 --> 51:54.653
- Tell you what. I will
take it under advisement.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.532
- Thank you, sir.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.702
♪♪

52:33.900 --> 52:37.319
- Yes, $3000 is very generous

52:37.320 --> 52:40.322
and will go a long way, but...

52:40.323 --> 52:43.367
$5000 would go even further.

52:43.368 --> 52:45.870
I understand.

52:45.871 --> 52:49.039
No, thank you so much
for your generosity.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.334
Bye.

53:00.552 --> 53:02.678
Kylie, hi! Come on in.

53:02.679 --> 53:05.014
Lovely day.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.016
- Are you sure now's
a good time to talk?

53:07.017 --> 53:08.976
I know you're in the thick

Are you still thinking
about dropping out of school?

53:23.366 --> 53:26.410

Have you met my father?

53:43.219 --> 53:46.889
On a good day,
he's listening-challenged.

Whitman Industrial Group

01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:22.644
- Ah, not much to talk about.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:27.190
I reacted, she reacted
and stormed out.

01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:29.442
- Well...

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:32.987
maybe Kylie taking
an academic leave

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:35.198
isn't the worst
thing on the planet.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:38.535
- Did you know about this?

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:41.454
- Well, we spoke about it,

01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:44.250
but I told her to talk to you.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:49.754
- Why didn't you just convince
her to run off to some commune

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.798
and sing Kumbaya?
- Wait a minute.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.843
You don't think
I talked her into this?
- No, of course not.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.304
I'm sure it's my fault. If I
weren't so rigid and regimented,

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.098
she might find me
more approachable.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.517
- Hey, hey, hey. If you would
stop beating yourself up

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:05.270
for a minute, maybe I can
help you out with this.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:08.356
- Just... I'm sorry.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.151
Just stop.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:13.987
I can't do this right now.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.739
- "Can't"?

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.244
I thought you struck that
word from your vocabulary.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.263
♪♪

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.643
- Sir.
- Morning, cadets.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.809
- Present arms!

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:39.154
- At ease, cadets.

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:43.077
- We've been up half the night.
Pretty impressive, huh, sir?

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.830
- With your permission, sir, I'd
like to take the cadets outside

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:51.292
to drill before class starts.
- Carry on, cadet.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:54.380
- Fall in!

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:16.152
- I'm proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:26.243
- Working!

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.247
- How did you do it? How'd
you come up with the money

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.249
for the uniforms?
- Don't ask questions

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.586
you don't want answers to.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.671
I fronted the money
for the uniforms

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.215
with the school budget
I set aside for the gala.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:43.845
I guess the formal term would
be misappropriation of funds.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.139
- Caroline, you shouldn't have.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.224
- I wasn't about to
disappoint those cadets.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:52.187
Or let them parade themselves
out in their student uniforms.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.813
They earned this.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.773
- Well, I'm not about
to leave you hanging.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:58.359
Do you have any ideas where we
can find the money for the gala?

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.279
- That's my problem,
remember? Your job was

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.825
to whip the cadets into shape.
- You don't want my help?

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.579
Look, if this
is about last night,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.333
I... I'm sorry.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:17.670
I was in a bad place and I might
have directed some of it at you.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:20.381
- Might have?

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.133
I can only imagine
how Kylie must feel.

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:26.095
Have you thought about how you
plan on fixing things with her?

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.847
- Ball's in her court.

01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:29.891
I just know I'm not about
to sit around and watch her make

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.977
the biggest mistake of her life.
- No, you're gonna stand here

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:35.229
with your arms crossed,
feeling justified.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:38.274
- Don't tell me
you agree with her.
- It's not about agreeing.

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:40.818
Right or wrong, this is about
Kylie needing you now.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:44.739
You once told me
people can change.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.243
Maybe now is the
time to show it.

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.247
- Why is it these don't pop in

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.458
like the picture on
the side of the printer?

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.836
I don't understand.

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:05.259
Oh. Well, of course
for you it works.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.512
Thanks, Colonel.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:10.139
Caroline's resume.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.476
I know. I mean,
I'm not supposed to know,

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:15.520
but I know.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:18.606
It's sad, you know?

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:21.818
- I do.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.362
- Uh, sorry, pal.
Your dean already called

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.156
and hit me up for a donation.
I'll tell you what I told her.

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:29.993
Charity begins at home.
- I'm not looking

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:31.744
for a donation.
I'm looking for an investment.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:34.288
- Come again?
- Do you have any idea

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.791
how many parents and community
members are going to come out

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.002
and help us celebrate
the Stone Creek centennial?

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.629
I just think it's a shame that
when the whole town comes out

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.840
on Saturday, the name
they're going to see plastered

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.009
on every program and every
banner is McGinty's Grill.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:50.096
- McGinty's? That place is
a town over, in Lewiston Falls.

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:52.640
- I know. Just think what that's
going to say to your loyal

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.726
patrons in Stone Creek.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.812
- Hold on there, soldier.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.981
- Colonel, that's
incredible news.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:03.985
Are you sure you don't want
to tell Caroline yourself?

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:06.070
- No, I'll leave that
to you, if you don't mind.

01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:08.448
- OK.
- I have something else

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:09.991
I have to take care of.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:13.036
- Well, looks like
you can scratch food

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.997
and catering off the list.
The Colonel just got

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.541
Callahan's to cater
the entire affair.

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:20.418
- What? The whole thing?

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.296
- He must be pretty
persuasive, that Colonel.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.465
- I'll say.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:28.968
That just came for you.
The Colonel had it sent over.

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:32.847
- If he thinks he's going
to have me spinning rifles,

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.309

You were right. I do try

But last night,

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.906
I started to realize that
it is not getting me anywhere.

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:21.539
I guess it's like...

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:26.252
how I shut down every time
you mention your mom.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.838
I suppose somewhere in my head,
I think if I don't talk

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.299
about it, then I won't feel

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.552
the pain of her
not being there anymore.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:37.556
But when you told me you were
dropping out of college...

01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:41.684
all I could think of was,

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:45.730
what would your mom say?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.692
What would she do?

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.696
But that's not what
came out of my mouth.

01:14:53.697 --> 01:14:55.656
All I could think of was...

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:59.578
I just wanted
to put life on hold.

01:15:00.954 --> 01:15:05.667

what's right for you...

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:10.756

You've made us all proud,

And I mean it this time.

abroad for a year

but yesterday
was very unlike you.

I think she's really
good for you, Dad.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.996

interrupting anything.

Hibbert, from McAdden

in Connecticut.
- Nice to meet you.

01:22:19.809 --> 01:22:21.644
- You too.
- He's heard about all

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.146

done here at the Academy.

likes to share credit,

01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:28.233

to turn this place around.

01:22:28.234 --> 01:22:32.112

be lucky to get her.

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.031

us when things wrap up here.

Senator Whitman?

01:22:49.172 --> 01:22:51.632
Class of '64.
- Ah, nice to meet you.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:54.009
Welcome back.
- Dean Foster was kind enough

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:58.555
to pay a visit to
the Senator and make
a plea on Stone Creek's behalf.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.474
- She asked me to push through
legislation to have Stone Creek

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.310
declared a historical landmark.

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.813
- Some things are more
valuable than money.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.399
- Based on what
I've seen here today,

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.859
I'm making it my mission
to see that happen.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.821
- So with the Academy
a historical landmark,

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.824
it can't be destroyed
or altered in any way?

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.827
- That's right.
- Thank you, Senator!

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.329
- I'm sure the board won't
be pleased about this,

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.498
but I'll make a strong bet
that this will translate

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:27.209
into job security for you both.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.087
That is, if you want it.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:32.840
- I do.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.425
- I do too.

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:38.887
- Great news. The Stone Creek
Academy server is down

01:23:38.888 --> 01:23:42.349
because there's been
so many hits over enrollment.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.059
Same thing
with the office voicemail.

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.148
I wouldn't be surprised if the
waiting list was full by spring!

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.693
- Can I hear a hooah?
- Hooah!

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.946
- Hooah!

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:00.534
- Hooah.

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.619
- Perfect.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.080
- I've been practicing.

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:08.542
- Senator, sir, thank you.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:11.086
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.008

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:23.891
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.394
- You are pretty amazing,
you know that?

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:30.230
- So I've been told.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:33.233
You're not so bad yourself.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.236
- Glad you decided
to stick around.

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.113
- Well, to tell you the truth,

01:24:38.114 --> 01:24:41.284
I haven't been able to shake
that quote I gave you.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:46.288
"Never give up on something
you can't go a day

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:49.042
without thinking about."

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.253
- Permission to
kiss you, Caroline?

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:57.549
- I thought you'd
never ask, Tom.
