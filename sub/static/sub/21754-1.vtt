00:31.642 --> 00:33.731
Okay, it's time to go to bed.

00:34.111 --> 00:37.235
When is Dad coming home? I want
to show him what I learned today.

00:37.315 --> 00:40.771
No, I already let you stay up
too late, I lost track of time.

00:41.075 --> 00:44.247
Plus, I don't know when your dad's
gonna be home. So, come on.

00:44.697 --> 00:47.745
I want you to be asleep
by the time Uncle Danny gets here.

00:47.825 --> 00:49.870
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

01:39.610 --> 01:41.254
Danny?

04:25.342 --> 04:28.588
- How did you sleep?
- Not great.

04:33.283 --> 04:35.162
I hate this brand.

04:36.687 --> 04:38.542
I'm sorry.

04:38.622 --> 04:40.500
I'll learn to like it.

04:56.006 --> 04:58.887
Sam, honey, it's time to wake up.

05:02.846 --> 05:04.624
Did you sleep well?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.162
What day is it?

05:10.087 --> 05:11.665
Saturday.

05:15.092 --> 05:16.921
Can I go swimming?

05:17.454 --> 05:20.919
I don't know. Let's wait and see
what the weather's gonna do.

05:22.199 --> 05:26.046
Why don't you come down in a bit?
I'll have breakfast ready soon.

05:59.535 --> 06:01.548
Vera, I'll fix it.

06:05.842 --> 06:08.105
Maybe Uncle Danny could fix it?

06:09.229 --> 06:11.291
He is a plumber, isn't he?

06:36.373 --> 06:39.987
Hey, Dad, I think you need
to teach me how to shave.

06:42.112 --> 06:44.790
You're not gonna have to worry
about that for a long time.

06:52.755 --> 06:56.758
- It fell.
- You're gonna be all sticky.

07:06.587 --> 07:09.115
There's still some in your nose.

07:50.918 --> 07:52.435
Sam!

07:52.515 --> 07:54.405
What are you doing?

07:55.185 --> 07:57.464
Where did you get this?

07:57.955 --> 07:59.909
I found it.

07:59.989 --> 08:01.568
Where?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.805
Hey, you can cut yourself with this thing.

08:06.629 --> 08:08.509
I'm sorry, Mom.

08:10.633 --> 08:13.691
It's okay, I just...
I don't want you getting hurt.

08:13.771 --> 08:15.648
Give me this.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.929
Where did this come from?

08:52.776 --> 08:55.999
Sam was just playing with it.
He can get hurt.

08:56.079 --> 08:58.001
Where did he get it?

08:58.081 --> 08:59.890
You tell me.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.038
Well, it isn't mine. It's probably...

09:02.118 --> 09:05.966
We can't have things like this
in the house, it's not safe.

09:08.098 --> 09:09.970
Let him be a kid.

09:11.528 --> 09:14.454
Ray, don't.

10:17.895 --> 10:20.317
Did Uncle Danny come by today?

10:20.897 --> 10:23.086
No, why?

10:23.166 --> 10:27.590
I thought I saw him. Didn't know
if he came by to fix the faucet.

10:29.270 --> 10:32.295
No. It was probably your imagination.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.418
It was in full swing today.

10:35.545 --> 10:38.769
Okay, sleep well. If you need me,
I'll be in the other room.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.704
I'm fine, Mom.

10:41.184 --> 10:43.630
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

11:49.786 --> 11:51.364
Sam?

11:54.691 --> 11:56.236
Sam?

12:09.372 --> 12:11.662
Hey, Mom, I'm making breakfast.

12:12.142 --> 12:13.897
Pancakes!

12:14.777 --> 12:16.366
Sam.

12:17.046 --> 12:19.186
You have lost your mind.

12:19.816 --> 12:21.703
Can I help?

12:22.083 --> 12:24.530
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

12:25.923 --> 12:29.001
Well, we're gonna take this. Just be careful.

12:38.468 --> 12:40.313
It's great.

13:36.026 --> 13:39.839
- I'm trying, I really am.
- There's nothing we can do.

13:41.498 --> 13:43.481
I'm going to fix this.

13:44.801 --> 13:46.381
How?

13:47.792 --> 13:49.839
I don't know yet.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.695
There'll be nothing to fix once he knows.

13:52.775 --> 13:55.013
He doesn't need to know.

13:55.093 --> 13:58.137
He's smart. He already knows.

13:58.548 --> 14:02.371
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing. Now go play.

14:02.451 --> 14:04.725
Well, is today Sunday?

14:05.655 --> 14:07.510
Yes, honey.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.646
Why aren't we going to church?

14:09.726 --> 14:12.234
We'd be late. We'll go next week.

14:12.314 --> 14:14.784
Can I go to Uncle Danny's and swim?

14:14.864 --> 14:18.155
- Not today.
- Why not? It's sunny.

14:18.235 --> 14:20.623
Sam, listen to your mother.

14:20.703 --> 14:24.327
Honey, the pool is too deep.
You haven't been swimming that well.

14:24.407 --> 14:27.020
That's not true, I've been fine before.

14:30.213 --> 14:33.225
Go play, and I'll be
downstairs in a bit, okay?

14:33.305 --> 14:37.340
Dad, do you wanna build another spaceship?

14:38.220 --> 14:41.069
Not right now, buddy,
I've got some work to do.

16:20.923 --> 16:22.424
Mom?

16:23.141 --> 16:24.914
Yes, honey?

16:24.994 --> 16:27.274
Are you and Dad getting a divorce?

16:28.966 --> 16:30.477
Sam.

16:34.937 --> 16:37.950
I don't want you to worry
about something like that.

16:40.577 --> 16:42.655
But are you?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.536
Things are just a little tough right now.

16:47.016 --> 16:49.862
But don't worry, please?

16:51.988 --> 16:55.613
We're gonna be all right.
I'll make sure of it.

16:56.093 --> 16:57.937
Trust me.

16:58.995 --> 17:00.757
You do trust me, don't you?

17:00.837 --> 17:03.876
Well, yeah, of course, Mom.

17:06.868 --> 17:10.517
You can go work on your puzzle.
I'm gonna finish the dishes.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.902
Hey, Mom?

17:20.281 --> 17:22.329
Did you do that section?

17:25.021 --> 17:27.834
I didn't. Your dad must have done it.

17:52.514 --> 17:54.537
This painting is ugly.

17:55.317 --> 17:57.330
I can't stand looking at it.

18:04.534 --> 18:06.383
Any progress?

18:06.663 --> 18:08.541
Not really.

18:15.237 --> 18:18.785
I don't know how much longer
I can keep lying to Sam.

18:27.517 --> 18:30.762
I'm gonna try to take a nap.

20:06.883 --> 20:08.461
Mom?

22:05.033 --> 22:06.377
Sam!

22:09.071 --> 22:11.590
Sam! Sam!

22:13.643 --> 22:15.738
- Mom! Mom!
- What?

22:15.818 --> 22:18.368
- Look, the girl!
- Honey, there's nothing.

22:18.448 --> 22:20.569
- But she was there.
- It's okay.

22:20.649 --> 22:23.260
Mom! Mom!

22:23.340 --> 22:25.517
- Who are you?
- Mom!

22:26.687 --> 22:28.778
- No, it's okay. No, it's okay.
- The man!

22:28.858 --> 22:32.281
It's okay. He was just a dream.

22:32.361 --> 22:34.851
You had some really
bad nightmares last night.

22:34.931 --> 22:38.610
- But... no.
- Yeah, you had us up worried.

22:40.269 --> 22:44.317
You have to give your imagination
a break before you go to bed.

22:47.777 --> 22:50.066
Do I have to go to school?

22:50.146 --> 22:52.792
It's summer, remember?

22:55.985 --> 22:58.464
Okay, yeah.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.572
You come on down whenever you're ready, okay?

23:42.965 --> 23:45.821
Will you tell your dad
breakfast is getting cold?

23:45.901 --> 23:47.446
Okay.

24:16.298 --> 24:19.778
Dad? Da... are you okay?

24:21.320 --> 24:23.525
Yes, Sam, I'm fine.

24:24.405 --> 24:27.727
Mom wanted me to make sure
you knew breakfast was getting cold.

24:28.577 --> 24:30.396
All right, I'll head down.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.708
I'm tired of this house!

27:30.426 --> 27:32.238
Just a minute.

28:03.059 --> 28:05.481
I'm sorry I scared you earlier.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.950
I didn't mean to.

28:08.830 --> 28:12.315
It's okay. It's just a glass.

28:14.135 --> 28:17.393
I tried to fix the faucet.

28:17.473 --> 28:20.020
I couldn't get the dripping to stop.

28:22.044 --> 28:23.922
It's just a sink.

28:29.218 --> 28:31.903
Sam and I can't continue like this.

28:35.557 --> 28:37.436
I can fix it.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.606
It's not worth fixing.

30:12.154 --> 30:14.033
Not tonight, John.

30:27.837 --> 30:29.682
Get out.

31:20.422 --> 31:22.234
Get out!

31:23.159 --> 31:26.638
Mom! Dad! Help!

31:27.729 --> 31:30.375
- Sam!
- Help!

31:30.967 --> 31:33.779
- Sam!
- Mom!

31:42.544 --> 31:45.377
Get... out!

31:48.517 --> 31:50.362
Get out!

32:08.904 --> 32:10.909
What day is it?

32:12.508 --> 32:14.031
Saturday.

32:15.244 --> 32:17.689
Do I have band practice today?

32:19.381 --> 32:21.393
Not till after the summer.

32:23.452 --> 32:25.942
This is the longest summer ever.

32:27.122 --> 32:29.111
I know.

32:29.191 --> 32:31.337
<i>He doesn't remember anything?</i>

32:33.482 --> 32:35.736
He thinks it's another nightmare.

32:38.867 --> 32:40.712
I'm sorry.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.549
For what?

32:46.342 --> 32:48.420
Not knowing how to fix this.

33:45.901 --> 33:49.181
- Did you get tired of the puzzle?
- No.

37:43.505 --> 37:44.893
What's up, Sam?

37:44.973 --> 37:46.848
- Guess what?
- What?

37:46.928 --> 37:49.530
I found my trumpet.

37:49.610 --> 37:50.932
That's great, Sam.

37:51.012 --> 37:54.470
I forgot that I never got to show you
the song that I learned.

37:54.550 --> 37:56.802
I've been forgetting a lot of things lately.

37:56.882 --> 38:00.311
I guess I'm getting old
like you and Uncle Danny.

38:00.621 --> 38:04.469
- We're not that old.
- Come on, you're only like 40.

38:05.694 --> 38:07.505
Can I show you?

38:12.167 --> 38:14.011
Not right now, son.

38:28.049 --> 38:31.707
Hey, Mom? Do you know who Julie is?

38:32.387 --> 38:34.579
- Who?
- Julie.

38:34.659 --> 38:37.068
She's the girl from my dreams.

38:39.127 --> 38:41.482
It's just a dream, honey.

38:41.562 --> 38:43.785
Well, Dad will know. I'll just ask him.

38:43.865 --> 38:45.594
Wait, wait, why would Dad know?

38:47.102 --> 38:49.114
Because he has a picture of her.

38:51.072 --> 38:52.603
Where?

39:02.818 --> 39:04.662
What are you doing?

39:06.654 --> 39:08.466
Why do you have these?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.503
I'm trying to figure this out.

39:18.467 --> 39:20.278
What did I do?

39:27.142 --> 39:29.520
Sam doesn't need to see these.

41:28.663 --> 41:30.175
Sam.

41:50.185 --> 41:53.832
Vera. Vera.

41:55.390 --> 41:57.802
I think she's... she's here.

41:58.927 --> 42:01.773
Good, the others will come.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.354
These items have a strong
connection between worlds...

42:06.434 --> 42:08.913
...and allow us to shorten the gap.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.660
Don't be afraid.

42:12.740 --> 42:15.113
They're mostly gentle spirits.

42:15.193 --> 42:17.288
They won't harm you.

42:18.579 --> 42:21.236
Vera. Ray.

42:21.316 --> 42:22.838
Sam.

42:23.218 --> 42:25.875
We have come to help.

42:27.255 --> 42:29.077
Why are they here?

42:29.257 --> 42:31.746
Souls that are lost become stuck...

42:31.826 --> 42:35.050
...between the living world
and the afterlife.

42:35.130 --> 42:37.008
A purgatory.

42:37.833 --> 42:39.385
Why?

42:40.035 --> 42:42.924
Something is unresolved in life.

42:43.532 --> 42:46.823
Souls can be forced to resolve them in death.

42:47.543 --> 42:48.960
So they're always here?

42:49.040 --> 42:51.306
Stop asking questions.
Can we just get this over with?

42:51.386 --> 42:56.137
Their astral bodies are now
confined in a parallel reality...

42:56.217 --> 42:59.497
...that often connects
with the world of the living.

43:00.956 --> 43:03.478
The connections between worlds
grows stronger...

43:03.558 --> 43:06.056
...unless we break that connection.

43:20.608 --> 43:22.553
They're all here.

43:25.313 --> 43:30.606
I'm here to help set your
lost souls free from this house.

43:31.186 --> 43:32.941
Will they be in pain?

43:33.021 --> 43:35.526
They're dead they can not be hurt.

43:35.606 --> 43:37.251
Really?

43:42.462 --> 43:45.753
Your time on Earth has passed...

43:45.833 --> 43:49.891
...your physical body's returned to dust...

43:50.271 --> 43:53.328
...it's time your souls continued on.

43:53.908 --> 43:55.536
Be cleansed.

43:57.545 --> 44:01.967
In a moment, your soul's atoning will begin.

44:02.650 --> 44:04.529
You'll be set free.

44:07.087 --> 44:10.935
And you'll no longer
be aware of their presence.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.834
Where will they go?

45:01.142 --> 45:03.088
What are you saying?

45:26.467 --> 45:28.045
Dad.

45:31.739 --> 45:33.714
What are you saying?

45:46.357 --> 45:50.367
May you find yourself
in the hands of eternity...

45:51.993 --> 45:55.506
...and be separated from your personal hell.

46:16.384 --> 46:17.963
Sam!

46:19.387 --> 46:20.908
Honey!

46:21.188 --> 46:24.011
- Honey, everything's gonna be okay.
- Those weren't ghosts.

46:24.091 --> 46:27.983
- It's okay.
- Dad, Mom said they were dreams.

46:29.163 --> 46:32.957
- I was just trying to protect you.
- Dad, Mom lied and said I was dreaming.

46:33.037 --> 46:36.088
- No, honey, you don't understand.
- Dad.

46:41.876 --> 46:44.132
Come on. Come on.

46:44.212 --> 46:46.090
Don't get used to this.

47:14.209 --> 47:15.571
So I'm dead?

47:18.146 --> 47:22.039
- Yes.
- Are you and Dad, too?

47:24.152 --> 47:25.536
Yup.

47:26.687 --> 47:28.499
How did I die?

47:32.327 --> 47:34.404
In your sleep.

47:35.696 --> 47:37.286
Why?

47:38.266 --> 47:40.077
I don't know.

47:42.603 --> 47:44.481
How long ago?

47:45.173 --> 47:47.918
I really... I really don't know, no.

47:57.652 --> 48:00.895
So, if I'm dead...

48:00.975 --> 48:02.999
...why do I still need to eat?

48:06.727 --> 48:11.599
I don't know, but we still feel and...

48:12.733 --> 48:14.579
...and get hurt.

48:16.604 --> 48:18.649
We get hungry.

48:23.611 --> 48:27.303
But I'm gonna make sure
that you never hurt again.

48:28.483 --> 48:31.038
You can't protect me from dying.

48:31.118 --> 48:33.197
You didn't before.

48:38.526 --> 48:40.351
<i>So we can't leave?</i>

48:42.062 --> 48:43.618
No.

48:43.998 --> 48:46.077
You tried pulling really hard?

48:47.902 --> 48:51.426
I've tried every window and door...

48:51.506 --> 48:53.350
...believe me.

48:54.274 --> 48:56.236
I'm gonna give it a shot.

49:08.323 --> 49:09.967
See?

49:14.729 --> 49:16.884
Maybe Dad should try.

49:16.964 --> 49:19.397
He's stronger than both of us.

49:20.768 --> 49:23.815
Does this mean I don't have to go to school?

49:25.606 --> 49:30.487
No, I don't guess so, but I should
probably start home schooling you.

49:32.079 --> 49:34.398
So what do we do now?

49:38.018 --> 49:39.560
We wait.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.965
For what?

49:43.123 --> 49:44.695
We don't know.

49:47.862 --> 49:49.940
I'm sure Dad will figure it out.

49:51.258 --> 49:54.021
Maybe that psychic lady did something.

49:54.101 --> 49:56.146
I'm gonna go try the back door.

50:09.049 --> 50:11.706
Do you really think that woman did anything?

50:11.786 --> 50:13.609
I don't know.

50:14.289 --> 50:16.301
Nothing feels different.

50:18.058 --> 50:19.914
Sam's different.

50:19.994 --> 50:22.873
He's taking it a lot better
than I thought he would.

50:24.732 --> 50:26.577
Well, I'm not.

51:13.764 --> 51:15.987
Can Dad tuck me in tonight?

51:16.417 --> 51:18.953
But I always tuck you in.

51:19.033 --> 51:20.898
I want Dad to do it.

51:22.322 --> 51:24.579
Sam, what's up?

51:25.609 --> 51:27.688
I want you to tuck me in.

51:49.183 --> 51:52.240
Go to bed, bud. I'm sure you're tired.

51:54.094 --> 51:58.163
So now that we're ghosts, do we have powers?

51:59.026 --> 52:01.071
Not that I'm aware of.

52:03.598 --> 52:05.420
Are you stronger?

52:05.850 --> 52:08.690
No, I wish I were.

52:09.570 --> 52:13.784
Dad, will you and Mom
ever be like you were before?

52:18.312 --> 52:20.237
I don't know, Sam.

52:20.547 --> 52:22.592
Let me know if I can help.

52:24.669 --> 52:26.480
Good night, Sam.

52:30.290 --> 52:32.136
How's Sam?

52:34.428 --> 52:36.273
He's a tough kid.

52:37.531 --> 52:40.945
I couldn't do anything about it,
he should know that.

52:42.670 --> 52:44.482
He just needs time.

52:47.442 --> 52:49.253
I'm just so tired.

52:52.012 --> 52:54.035
Well, maybe you can rest now.

52:54.855 --> 52:56.537
Things can change.

52:56.617 --> 52:59.263
Things have already changed so much.

53:01.021 --> 53:02.865
What if...

53:03.479 --> 53:06.887
...what if this is God's way
of giving us a second chance?

53:08.846 --> 53:10.986
God doesn't exist, Ray.

53:12.466 --> 53:15.079
We'd be somewhere other than here if he did.

53:15.970 --> 53:18.859
Or we're here for a reason.

53:19.889 --> 53:21.780
We can start over.

53:23.110 --> 53:25.363
Maybe this is our way out.

53:28.683 --> 53:31.345
I just want Sam to be happy again.

53:34.521 --> 53:36.333
He can be.

55:31.571 --> 55:34.749
Hey, we didn't mean to wake you.

55:34.829 --> 55:38.436
No, I slept really well.
I didn't need to sleep any longer.

55:39.183 --> 55:41.679
I was just showing Dad what I learned.

55:42.149 --> 55:44.028
Hope you like it.

56:20.586 --> 56:21.541
Ray.

56:21.621 --> 56:24.681
I'm sorry, babe. I didn't...
I didn't mean to scare you.

56:28.825 --> 56:33.270
I don't know why you fool with the makeup
anyway, you're already so beautiful.

56:33.350 --> 56:34.515
Really?

56:35.035 --> 56:36.816
I'm serious.

56:40.574 --> 56:43.053
These aren't even my colors, anyway.

56:44.779 --> 56:46.656
It looks fine.

56:51.151 --> 56:53.463
I'll give you some privacy.

57:23.783 --> 57:26.827
Sam, you wanna help me
put together another puzzle?

57:27.587 --> 57:29.644
Who's gonna be first to get a corner?

57:29.724 --> 57:32.579
- I'll find one first.
- What's the bet?

57:33.059 --> 57:35.215
Got one. No bet.

57:35.295 --> 57:38.152
I think we picked a puzzle
with way too many pieces, buddy.

57:38.232 --> 57:40.851
Probably should have bet you.

01:01:45.412 --> 01:01:47.291
Who's there?

01:01:54.721 --> 01:01:56.744
You don't have to be scared.

01:01:57.524 --> 01:01:59.369
I'm not a mean ghost.

01:02:51.577 --> 01:02:55.259
- That's impressive, Sam.
- Well, I didn't...

01:02:59.953 --> 01:03:02.695
I didn't do a very good job.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.170
Yeah, well, dinner will be ready in a bit.

01:03:31.451 --> 01:03:33.680
So, what do you want to eat?

01:03:34.654 --> 01:03:37.164
All we have are frozen dinners.

01:03:37.424 --> 01:03:39.048
That's fine.

01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:43.574
Wish they had better taste in groceries.

01:03:47.166 --> 01:03:49.212
<i>Are there more people like us?</i>

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:55.194
- What do you mean?
- Ghosts? Good ghosts.

01:03:55.274 --> 01:03:57.553
I'm sure we're not the only ones.

01:03:58.912 --> 01:04:01.001
Are they here, too?

01:04:01.481 --> 01:04:03.403
I don't think so.

01:04:03.483 --> 01:04:05.773
This is kind of our little spot...

01:04:06.503 --> 01:04:08.524
...for now at least.

01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:10.611
Why?

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:13.775
I was just thinking that...

01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:16.013
...maybe they knew the way out.

01:04:16.963 --> 01:04:19.519
What if that's the only answer?

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:21.255
I'll figure it out.

01:04:21.435 --> 01:04:23.069
How?

01:04:24.404 --> 01:04:26.456
Your dad and I are working on it.

01:04:27.707 --> 01:04:29.629
Can I help?

01:04:29.709 --> 01:04:31.665
I don't want you having to worry about it.

01:04:31.745 --> 01:04:35.955
I'm not worrying, Mom,
I just... just want to help.

01:05:25.699 --> 01:05:27.243
Hello?

01:05:29.168 --> 01:05:30.680
Hello?

01:05:32.939 --> 01:05:34.518
Vanessa.

01:05:49.055 --> 01:05:50.867
Are you there?

01:05:55.529 --> 01:05:57.374
Are you still here?

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.449
I need to ask you a question.

01:06:26.493 --> 01:06:28.505
How do we get out of here?

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:39.015
Why can't I tell them about you?

01:07:15.675 --> 01:07:17.521
I just wanna help.

01:08:02.155 --> 01:08:06.413
I wish that family would invest
in a dishwasher that works.

01:08:06.893 --> 01:08:08.716
Then we'd be in heaven.

01:08:09.796 --> 01:08:11.841
I guess we're not missing much.

01:08:19.606 --> 01:08:21.082
Do you...

01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:24.011
...do you think there's a hell?

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:30.225
I don't know what I believe.

01:08:39.358 --> 01:08:42.171
You don't think we're
getting out of this, do you?

01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:45.675
I don't know, Vera.

01:08:56.274 --> 01:08:58.698
Do you remember when we first got married?

01:08:59.478 --> 01:09:01.358
We were so broke.

01:09:03.783 --> 01:09:07.331
We'd take bets on how long we could
make a bottle of shampoo last.

01:09:11.357 --> 01:09:13.979
We'd go to every pot luck at church...

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.939
...to save on groceries.

01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:21.933
I thought we'd never get out of that rut.

01:09:22.736 --> 01:09:24.680
But we did.

01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:27.651
We pushed through.

01:09:29.876 --> 01:09:32.118
Made a better life for Sam.

01:09:41.154 --> 01:09:44.200
Maybe that's how we get out.

01:09:46.426 --> 01:09:48.705
We have to resolve this.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:52.408
Make it work.

01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:56.179
For Sam.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.882
For Sam.

01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:25.018
Mom, Dad.

01:10:25.098 --> 01:10:27.119
What is it, honey?

01:10:28.301 --> 01:10:30.780
There's someone in my room.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.260
Who?

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.996
He said he wanted to play with me.

01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:39.959
- I thought he could help.
- Who?

01:10:40.579 --> 01:10:42.429
He said his name was...

01:10:45.685 --> 01:10:47.260
- Sam!
- Sam!

01:10:48.121 --> 01:10:51.511
- Sam!
- Sam, what's happening?

01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:53.557
Sam!

01:10:56.395 --> 01:10:58.131
Sam!

01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:00.854
Sam! Sam, what's happening?

01:11:00.934 --> 01:11:02.810
Sam!

01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:07.015
Sam!

01:11:07.907 --> 01:11:10.964
When's Dad coming home?
I wanna show him what I learned today.

01:11:11.044 --> 01:11:14.728
No, I already let you stay up too late.
I lost track of time.

01:11:14.808 --> 01:11:17.974
Plus, I don't know when your dad's
gonna be home. So, come on.

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:21.575
I want you to be asleep
by the time Uncle Danny gets here.

01:11:21.655 --> 01:11:23.732
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

01:11:33.066 --> 01:11:35.879
Yes, Sam.

01:12:02.195 --> 01:12:03.708
No!

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:08.077
Sam!

01:12:17.744 --> 01:12:19.392
Ray?

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:25.994
What are you doing?

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:34.248
Yes, Sam.

01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:36.906
Yes, Sam.

01:12:52.311 --> 01:12:54.200
- Ray.
- What the hell, Vera?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.935
- Ray.
- Who did you tell?

01:12:56.015 --> 01:12:59.295
- No one, I didn't tell anyone.
- That's a lie.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:03.109
No, I... I told my brother,
that is it, I promise.

01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:05.745
You're gonna make me lose everything.

01:13:05.925 --> 01:13:08.907
No, this is not my fault.

01:13:08.987 --> 01:13:11.350
She is 16, Ray.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.308
How could you?

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:22.978
- So, what are you gonna do, just leave?
- What do you expect me to do?

01:13:23.058 --> 01:13:25.892
I've put up with this long enough,
and I'm not gonna put up with it anymore.

01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:29.243
- Not... not with her.
- No one is gonna find out.

01:13:30.283 --> 01:13:31.971
You're drunk.

01:13:32.051 --> 01:13:36.139
Okay, just... we'll just talk
about it when you're sober.

01:13:36.389 --> 01:13:38.444
Oh, no, you're gonna forget about this now.

01:13:38.524 --> 01:13:41.127
No, I can't, I can't.

01:13:41.207 --> 01:13:45.318
- Shut your mouth.
- No, Ray. You know this isn't right.

01:13:45.398 --> 01:13:48.507
- Shut up!
- I'm leaving with Sam.

01:13:50.703 --> 01:13:52.581
Does he know?

01:13:55.874 --> 01:13:57.163
Not yet.

01:13:57.243 --> 01:13:58.798
- You can't tell him.
- Let me go.

01:13:58.878 --> 01:14:01.511
- Promise me you won't tell...
- Let me go!

01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:31.084
Yes, Sam.

01:14:41.487 --> 01:14:43.032
No!

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:49.516
No!

01:14:50.096 --> 01:14:51.615
Yes.

01:15:03.409 --> 01:15:05.164
Vanessa?

01:15:05.244 --> 01:15:07.146
Hey, Ray.

01:15:08.347 --> 01:15:10.369
What are you doing here?

01:15:10.449 --> 01:15:12.261
I miss you.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.699
You need to leave.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.270
Just one more time.

01:15:23.326 --> 01:15:27.148
No, no. You gotta leave me alone.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:30.713
Come on, Ray.

01:15:32.438 --> 01:15:34.450
I know you missed me, too.

01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:40.869
Let's do it again.
Like that night in the rain.

01:15:53.526 --> 01:15:55.103
No.

01:15:55.795 --> 01:15:57.883
Please, Ray?

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.353
Let me go.

01:16:00.433 --> 01:16:03.526
- Come on!
- Let me go.

01:16:38.254 --> 01:16:41.050
- Are you okay?
- Mom! Dad did it.

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.796
Get away from us.

01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:44.863
- Sam.
- Go away!

01:16:44.943 --> 01:16:47.733
- Sam.
- We don't deserve this.

01:16:47.813 --> 01:16:50.563
- What do you want me to do?
- Get out!

01:16:52.218 --> 01:16:54.684
- Get out!
- Vera.

01:16:55.354 --> 01:16:56.932
Vera.

01:16:57.956 --> 01:16:59.802
Go away.

01:17:01.267 --> 01:17:02.783
No.

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:07.910
- Listen...
- No, no, not anymore.

01:17:12.969 --> 01:17:15.002
It wasn't the real me.

01:17:15.809 --> 01:17:17.836
Yes, it was.

01:17:19.979 --> 01:17:22.069
It wasn't the me I wanted.

01:17:23.049 --> 01:17:25.128
It doesn't matter, you did it.

01:17:27.954 --> 01:17:30.009
I don't know why I did it.

01:17:30.589 --> 01:17:32.635
Yes, you do.

01:17:33.993 --> 01:17:38.321
I was scared. I didn't...
I didn't know any other way out.

01:17:39.031 --> 01:17:41.443
I didn't know what to do, I...

01:17:45.371 --> 01:17:49.011
- It was hell.
- It was hell for us.

01:17:54.113 --> 01:17:55.711
I'm sorry.

01:17:58.852 --> 01:18:00.663
For what?

01:18:03.489 --> 01:18:05.368
For everything.

01:18:07.526 --> 01:18:09.538
You and Sam deserve more.

01:18:12.866 --> 01:18:16.045
I'm sorry for taking you and Sam with me.

01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:32.695
I know it's worthless...

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.325
...I just wanna fix it, I really do.

01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:43.772
I can't do that without you and Sam.

01:18:51.019 --> 01:18:52.846
It's our only way out.

01:19:24.904 --> 01:19:26.216
Sam.

01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:31.253
Sam, please, look at me.

01:19:32.611 --> 01:19:34.468
Look at me.

01:19:35.348 --> 01:19:37.160
Vera, give him to me.

01:19:39.352 --> 01:19:41.240
No, Ray.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.376
He's my son!

01:19:43.456 --> 01:19:45.268
He was your son.

01:19:46.925 --> 01:19:48.462
Sam, I'm sorry.

01:19:49.862 --> 01:19:51.584
Stay away from us.

01:19:51.674 --> 01:19:54.921
- Let him go!
- Leave us alone.

01:19:55.501 --> 01:19:58.624
- We have to stay together.
- It's over, Ray.

01:19:58.704 --> 01:20:01.717
- Give him to me!
- Go to hell!

01:20:02.909 --> 01:20:05.583
Vera! Vera! Please!

01:20:09.998 --> 01:20:11.510
Vera.

01:20:22.094 --> 01:20:23.939
Vera, let me in!

01:22:18.377 --> 01:22:21.400
If something is unresolved in life...

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:25.428
...souls can be forced
to resolve them in death.

01:22:26.052 --> 01:22:27.540
Yes.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.671
Those connections between worlds grow
stronger unless we break that connection.

01:22:32.891 --> 01:22:34.436
Vera!

01:25:16.622 --> 01:25:18.133
Ray?

01:25:32.204 --> 01:25:34.016
He's gone?

01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:38.987
It's just us now.

01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:45.578
