WEBVTT

01:08.819 --> 01:11.489
- What do you want?
- Been

01:12.948 --> 01:15.326
All I got is piss-warm Change.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.952
That's my brand.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.640
This is damn good.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.770
I'd say this is the best beer
I've ever had.

01:44.355 --> 01:45.564
Actually...

01:45.856 --> 01:47.024
Need anything there?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.527
I'm just glad to be alive right now.

01:50.528 --> 01:53.364
I was up a few towns away.
You know Saragosa?

01:53.906 --> 01:57.326
I was at a bar there.
Not unlike this one, they serve beer.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.370
Not as good as this, but close.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.791
And I saw something
you wouldn't believe.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.211
I'm sitting there by myself.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.879
Now, this bar...

02:10.214 --> 02:11.715
...was full of lowlifes.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.930
I mean,
not like this place here.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.682
No, I mean bad.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.684
Like they were up to no good.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.896
I'm all by myself.
I like it that way.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.858
Meanwhile, things are going on.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.237
Under-the-table kinds of things.
Not too obvious...

02:33.612 --> 02:35.322
...but not too secret either.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.576
So...

02:39.410 --> 02:41.495
...I'm sitting there...

02:43.539 --> 02:45.624
...and in walks...

02:45.916 --> 02:49.211
<i>...the biggest Mexican
I have ever seen...</i>

02:49.420 --> 02:51.255
<i>...like he owns the place.</i>

02:51.547 --> 02:54.466
<i>Nobody knew what
to make of him or think of him.</i>

02:55.050 --> 02:57.469
<i>But there he was, and in he walked.</i>

02:58.262 --> 02:59.763
He was dark too.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.434
I don't mean dark-skinned.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.436
This was different.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.272
It was as if he was always
walking in a shadow.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.941
<i>Every step he took
towards the light...</i>

03:11.108 --> 03:14.778
<i>...just when you thought his face
would be revealed, it wasn't.</i>

03:15.279 --> 03:18.741
It was as if the lights dimmed
just for him.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.668
So this guy...

03:31.378 --> 03:33.088
<i>...takes a seat at the bar...</i>

03:33.297 --> 03:35.633
<i>...orders a soda, sits back,
says nothing.</i>

03:35.925 --> 03:37.176
He ordered a soda pop?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.803
I wasn't interested in his drink.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.514
I was interested in what he carried.

03:43.641 --> 03:46.769
<i>Some sort of a suitcase,
kind of heavy.</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:50.022
<i>And he sat that thing beside him
as if it were his girl.</i>

03:52.900 --> 03:55.194
Then, all of a sudden,
the bastard spoke.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.782
<i>You know he was talking business
because he upset the bartender.</i>

03:59.990 --> 04:02.034
Especially when he mentioned...

04:02.826 --> 04:04.787
He said something like:

04:06.497 --> 04:08.332
"Bitch" or...

04:09.124 --> 04:10.167
..."Bucho."

04:16.548 --> 04:18.175
That's what it was.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.677
Bucho!

04:22.680 --> 04:24.932
<i>He pissed off the bartender plenty.</i>

04:25.182 --> 04:27.685
<i>Some of those unsavory characters...</i>

04:27.935 --> 04:31.730
...not like these boys, but real scum,
they got pissed too.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.693
Started pulling guns and knives.
Starting some shit.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.528
<i>Now, the stranger...</i>

04:37.778 --> 04:39.446
...bolts off of the barstool.

04:39.655 --> 04:43.158
He dives into the middle of the room
with his case. Dives right in.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.037
I don't know what he does there, but
in two shakes the suitcase is open...

04:47.204 --> 04:51.375
...and he's pulled out the biggest hand
cannon I've ever fucking seen.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.481
That was just the beginning.

05:15.566 --> 05:19.486
You just stood there?
You didn't run for cover or join in'?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.905
I was frozen stiff.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.408
All I could do was watch this...

05:28.579 --> 05:30.414
...thing tear the place apart.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.874
<i>It was amazing.</i>

05:35.419 --> 05:37.755
Cutthroat scumbags
were coming forward...

05:37.921 --> 05:40.924
...and dying much-deserved deaths.
Don't get me wrong...

05:41.091 --> 05:45.012
...this was no class-act group
like you got here. Not at all.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.723
No, these guys were world-class turds.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.601
I'm sorry, but they got
what they deserved.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.603
It was Judgment Night in that place.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.400
<i>He grabs one of these guys...</i>

05:58.609 --> 06:00.319
...the only guy still breathing.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.821
<i>He starts getting
information out of him.</i>

06:03.030 --> 06:04.656
<i>And I knew by the whispering...</i>

06:04.948 --> 06:07.117
<i>...this guy was giving up the goods.</i>

06:07.409 --> 06:10.079
Spilling his guts.
Confessing the world.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.164
He told that stranger everything.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.958
Everything?

06:20.964 --> 06:24.343
Can I get a cleaner mug?
This one's dirty.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.346
Fuck you.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.557
It's the cleanest one I got.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.609
So anyway...

06:41.485 --> 06:42.653
...without warning...

06:42.861 --> 06:44.696
...without any hint or preview...

06:45.197 --> 06:46.865
...the stranger whips around...

06:47.157 --> 06:49.952
...and he sees me.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.995
You saw his face?

06:52.663 --> 06:53.997
His face?

06:54.331 --> 06:55.332
No.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.210
His eyes.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.522
<i>And he didn't do anything to you?</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:21.358
<i>Not really. He turned
to the guy on the floor.</i>

07:24.111 --> 07:25.696
<i>Stranger shot him...</i>

07:26.864 --> 07:30.325
<i>...walked over to the bartender,
paid and left.</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:32.661
The bartender lived?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.668
The bartender never gets killed.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.046
But...

07:44.006 --> 07:45.757
...as he neared the door...

07:52.389 --> 07:55.184
No, man, the bartender got it
worse than anybody.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.774
Here. It's on the house...

08:04.443 --> 08:06.069
...if you remember his face.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.698
Thanks, but no thanks.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.242
I'm clearing out of here.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.952
Because I think...

08:14.912 --> 08:16.288
...he's headed this way.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.751
Thank you, boys!

08:20.918 --> 08:22.377
Y'all take care!

09:55.095 --> 09:56.138
Bitch.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.521
Get back.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.066
Stay back.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.320
Please!

12:10.522 --> 12:11.815
Who is it?

12:12.315 --> 12:14.401
It's your only friend.

12:20.991 --> 12:24.119
Don't you think you're being
a little too cautious?

12:31.626 --> 12:35.005
One day you'll lay too hard on that
and blow your brains out.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.426
What do you want?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.307
He's there.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.353
I mentioned his name
and they freaked.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.522
Bucho's there?

12:53.064 --> 12:56.359
One second they weren't
listening to a word I said...

12:56.651 --> 12:59.696
...but when I mentioned him,
they listened.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.202
And suddenly they got very interested
in who you were.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.748
So I laid the story down
nice and thick.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.708
How thick?

13:12.167 --> 13:13.210
Pretty thick.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.545
You were the biggest Mexican
I'd ever seen.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.755
Wonderful.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.216
I exaggerated, but they bought it.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.843
They're shitting bricks right now,
I promise.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.053
Where do I go?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.850
Tarasco Bar's a good start.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.729
Don't turn it into a bloodbath
like last time.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.189
That wasn't my fault.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.525
- Of course not.
- They started it.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.693
Whatever. Just remember...

13:38.902 --> 13:42.239
...Bucho has plenty of thugs,
but without them, he's dead.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.282
Save your bullets.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.201
Suddenly...

13:46.910 --> 13:48.286
...you're my big brother.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.040
I do feel some responsibility for you.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.588
What happens when he's dead?

14:01.550 --> 14:03.093
When Bucho's dead...

14:06.638 --> 14:08.014
...it's over.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.810
He's the last one.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.438
End of payback. Eye for an eye.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.941
You finally going to be satisfied?

14:19.109 --> 14:20.443
I think so.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.779
I hope so.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.619
I don't have the stomach
for this anymore.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.664
You never did.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.959
Neither did you.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.269
I just called the Oro Verde Bar
in Saragosa.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.399
There was no answer.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.361
Let me know if you hear anything.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.114
Okay. Bye.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.244
I want a close lookout
on all operations.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.248
That means double and triple
checking, even our regular customers.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.542
<i>- I'll</i> handle it.
- By the way...

16:40.709 --> 16:43.712
...where's my car? Is it finished?
How long must I wait?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.255
I sent it back.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.550
Again? I could have built the thing
myself by now.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.052
- And what's this?
-It's my sister's nephew.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.556
He needs work, so he wanted to
show you his fighting abilities.

16:54.806 --> 16:58.435
You call this an audition,
fighting against Pipon?

16:58.935 --> 17:02.647
If he can't beat Cristos,
I'm not interested. Get in there.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.775
Hey, Pipon. Get out!

17:23.918 --> 17:26.004
He doesn't look special so far.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.883
Kick his ass!

18:06.294 --> 18:08.004
That's more like it.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.844
He'll never dance again.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.982
- So much for Cristos.
- Told you.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.027
Listen. This is what I want you to do.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.073
Take extra men and place them
around the Tarasco and La Azteca.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.201
These Colombians wonder
if I can handle the extra volume.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.286
They're watching us enough as it is.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.038
- Hey.
- What?

18:42.330 --> 18:43.873
And him?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.587
Cast that leg up.
And welcome to the family.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.860
How much in dollars?

20:02.452 --> 20:03.620
$18,000.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.456
Fuck.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.794
Should we pay him...or kill him?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.172
More for us...

20:15.632 --> 20:17.300
I have a house payment.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.469
Kill 'em.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.188
Excuse me.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.773
But...

20:31.981 --> 20:33.650
...I used to work in a bar...

20:33.816 --> 20:36.486
...so I know what it's like
to wait on people.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.822
And I want to tell you
that the service here...

20:40.114 --> 20:42.659
...needs immediate improvement.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.328
What do you mean?

20:45.787 --> 20:47.038
What do I mean?

20:47.956 --> 20:49.165
Our waiter...

20:50.583 --> 20:51.626
...where is he?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.422
Don't tell me
he's still in the bathroom.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.469
He never came back to see if we
wanted anything else.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.805
He never brought us our check.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.684
We wanted our check so we could
get the hell out of here.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.688
Here.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.731
This should be sufficient.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.359
And don't be expecting a tip.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.697
If you don't treat me good,
I won't ask you out.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.950
And your beer tastes like piss.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.744
- We know!
- Because we piss in it!

21:27.203 --> 21:28.871
That's not all!

21:31.708 --> 21:34.669
Bad beer, bad service.
Don't they know not to come in?

21:44.846 --> 21:46.973
<i>Two cervezas.</i>

21:47.515 --> 21:48.725
These are for you.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.069
Just a minute.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.545
I wanted to see the guitar.

23:03.633 --> 23:04.926
Do you play?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.136
Yes, do you?

23:07.595 --> 23:08.971
A little bit.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.307
Play something.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.102
Not right now.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.480
This is my father's,
but he doesn't play anymore.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.023
No?

23:19.482 --> 23:23.778
There's not much work for a mariachi.
Now he just watches TV.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.698
I'm sorry to hear that.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.159
He was never that good anyway.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.829
Not as good as I'll be. Listen.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.504
Loosen your fingers a bit.

23:47.677 --> 23:48.970
Like this.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.727
You know what I mean?

23:58.020 --> 23:59.105
Loosen them up.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.316
How do you do that?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.152
All right.

24:05.695 --> 24:06.821
Give me this.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.831
Forget this hand, okay?
You want to get faster.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.167
Here's the secret.

24:24.505 --> 24:25.631
Got it?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.049
Good.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.719
Practice this...

24:31.721 --> 24:32.930
...every day.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.435
All day.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.314
Next time...

24:42.064 --> 24:44.066
...I'll show you how to play a tune...

24:44.358 --> 24:46.152
...using what you've learned.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.240
Practice.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.601
This reminds me of a joke.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.772
This guy comes into a bar...

25:23.105 --> 25:25.107
...walks to the bartender and says...

25:25.399 --> 25:27.777
..."Bartender, I got a bet for you.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.738
I'll bet you $300 that I can piss...

25:30.947 --> 25:32.949
...into that glass over there...

25:33.199 --> 25:34.617
...and not spill a drop."

25:36.077 --> 25:39.205
The bartender looks at the glass.
It's 10 feet away.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.456
He says...

25:40.748 --> 25:42.959
..."You're telling me
you'll bet me $300...

25:43.251 --> 25:45.211
...that you can piss,
standing here...

25:45.419 --> 25:48.506
...into that glass,
and not spill a single drop?"

25:49.715 --> 25:51.509
Customer looks up and says:

25:52.260 --> 25:53.511
"That's right."

25:53.970 --> 25:56.138
Bartender says, "You've got a bet."

25:56.347 --> 25:58.641
The guy goes, "Okay, here we go."

25:59.267 --> 26:00.977
Pulls out his thing.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.895
He's thinking about the glass.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.940
He's thinking about the glass.
Thinking about his dick.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.860
Dick, glass, dick, glass,
dick, glass, dick, glass.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.321
Then he lets it rip.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.741
He pisses all over the place.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.493
He pisses on the bar.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.955
He pisses on the stools,
on the floor, the phone.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.124
On the bartender!

26:23.666 --> 26:27.461
He's pissing everywhere
except the fucking glass!

26:27.670 --> 26:30.214
Right? Okay. So bartender...

26:30.381 --> 26:33.467
...he's laughing.
He's $300 richer. He's like:

26:34.385 --> 26:35.845
Piss dripping off his face.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.347
He says, "You fucking idiot, man!

26:38.556 --> 26:41.309
You got it in everything
except the glass!

26:42.018 --> 26:45.021
You owe me $300, puta."

26:46.355 --> 26:49.150
Guy goes, "Excuse me
just one little second."

26:49.358 --> 26:50.860
Goes in the back of the bar.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.821
There's a couple of guys
playing pool.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.364
He walks over to them.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.575
Comes back to the bar.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.328
Goes, "Here you go. $300."

27:01.287 --> 27:02.538
The bartender's like:

27:02.830 --> 27:05.875
"Why are you so happy?
You just lost $300, idiot!"

27:06.292 --> 27:08.711
The guy says,
"See those guys there?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.548
I just bet them $500 apiece...

27:13.799 --> 27:15.718
...that I could piss on your bar...

27:16.010 --> 27:19.221
...your ﬂoor, your phone,
and piss on you...

27:20.056 --> 27:23.517
...and not only would you not
be mad about it...

27:23.726 --> 27:25.394
...you'd be happy"

27:34.070 --> 27:35.529
That's funny shit, huh?

27:36.405 --> 27:38.866
"You'd be happy about it!"

27:44.205 --> 27:45.331
Guess what?

27:49.752 --> 27:51.045
He didn't check out.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.006
You...

27:54.965 --> 27:57.093
...you checked out just fine.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.098
Well, I knew I would because...

28:02.390 --> 28:03.641
...me and Bucco...

28:03.933 --> 28:05.184
-...we go way back.
- Bucho.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.894
Him too.

28:10.481 --> 28:11.649
And this guy...

28:11.941 --> 28:14.485
- I just met him today.
- Go on in.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.112
Good work, by the way.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.571
- Good work.
- Go in.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.491
Nice to see you cross the I's
and dot the T's here.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.451
It's cool, ése, cool.

28:22.868 --> 28:23.953
Lead the way.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.331
In there?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.793
Fucking disgusting.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.192
What do you want?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.321
I'm just looking for work.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.364
There's no work here.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.658
I see.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.666
Is there something to drink?

29:52.875 --> 29:54.668
Is there something in the case?

29:54.877 --> 29:56.212
Yeah.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.588
What?

29:58.088 --> 29:59.381
MY guitar.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.389
Sure you don't want to hear me play
before you say there's no work?

30:08.015 --> 30:10.476
We just want to see
what's in the case.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.228
If it's like you say...

30:12.728 --> 30:14.063
...drink all you want.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.735
But I told you already.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.279
I'm a musician.
This is my guitar.

30:22.571 --> 30:23.572
Don't touch it!

30:24.073 --> 30:25.491
Get him away!

30:33.624 --> 30:34.667
Hurry.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.586
How you doing?

30:40.089 --> 30:41.549
What is it?

30:41.715 --> 30:42.800
It's a guitar.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.430
It's a guitar.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.518
We heard about a case full of guns.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.436
I know.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.813
Just had to make sure.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.398
I understand.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.153
It's him!

31:05.447 --> 31:06.615
Well, yes.

31:06.824 --> 31:07.866
It's me.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.537
I'm not against you, so keep it down.

31:11.787 --> 31:12.788
Keep it down.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.625
I'm just looking for a man who calls--

31:18.794 --> 31:20.296
Not yet.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.785
What the fuck's going on?!

31:54.705 --> 31:55.956
Is that going on now?

32:37.373 --> 32:38.540
Watch him!

32:38.874 --> 32:40.376
What the fuck's going on?

32:50.219 --> 32:51.387
Friends of yours?

32:52.680 --> 32:56.392
I swear I have no fucking idea
what the hell's going on!

33:10.072 --> 33:11.573
Shit!

33:57.119 --> 33:58.620
You missed me!

34:26.815 --> 34:28.150
Get up.

34:30.611 --> 34:31.820
Come here.

34:35.157 --> 34:39.161
I'm looking for a man
who calls himself "Bucho."

34:40.662 --> 34:41.663
That's all.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.375
But you had to do it the hard way.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.133
Listen to me.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.886
I don't want to kill you.

34:56.887 --> 35:00.015
I just want you to take me to him.
Understand?

35:11.026 --> 35:13.362
Tried to shoot me in the back, huh?!

35:22.162 --> 35:23.205
Fucked

35:58.574 --> 36:00.033
If you want to go...

36:00.701 --> 36:02.411
<i>“SQ</i>

36:03.579 --> 36:05.080
If you're going to stay...

36:06.707 --> 36:07.749
...relax.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.768
Fuck you!

39:47.761 --> 39:49.137
The money's still in back.

39:49.346 --> 39:50.764
So's the pickup.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.684
Pick-up Guy's lying on the ﬂoor
with 3 bullets in his head.

39:54.935 --> 39:57.479
- Tavo must have shot him.
- Where's Tavo?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.147
Tavo's outside.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.567
- Where?
- Two blocks up.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.153
Tell him to get his ass over here!

40:05.362 --> 40:07.989
- I want to know what happened!
- He's dead.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.317
I'll tell you, boss...

40:45.318 --> 40:47.863
...whoever it was didn't
come for the money.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.364
No.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.324
They came for me.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.330
You've heard stories of the man
with a guitar case full of weapons.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.665
Bucho.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.377
Those are stories.
That's all they are, stories.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.880
I cannot believe it.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.180
Can't you see we are fucking closed?!

41:16.224 --> 41:17.559
We need to find him.

41:17.726 --> 41:20.020
You said the Colombians
are watching.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.771
So we move quickly.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.899
He's probably left town.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.234
He knows I'm here now.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.570
He's not going anywhere.

41:40.207 --> 41:41.541
Where am I?

41:42.209 --> 41:43.543
Bookstore.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.962
Bookstore-cafe.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.595
What the hell did you give me?

41:53.887 --> 41:55.263
Painkillers.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.681
I'm operating.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.190
Where is everybody?

42:05.732 --> 42:07.943
I closed early
so no one would come around.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.196
No one would come around anyway.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.325
- Why?
- Nobody reads.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.793
Is it yours? All those...

42:25.001 --> 42:26.253
.“books?

42:27.337 --> 42:28.588
It's mine.

42:28.797 --> 42:30.799
My parents passed away.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.718
They left me the building
and some money.

42:33.969 --> 42:35.512
I have an apartment upstairs.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.767
Why a bookstore?

42:40.976 --> 42:43.311
This town never had a bookstore.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.606
So I get this bright idea.

42:49.484 --> 42:52.028
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

42:55.323 --> 42:56.783
Why a bookstore, huh?

42:57.617 --> 42:59.953
All right. Isn't there a hospital?

43:00.161 --> 43:03.456
Trust me. You don't want
to go to a hospital here.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.962
You'll never find work in this town.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.757
- What?
- The guitar.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.843
Nobody hires musicians around here.

43:16.678 --> 43:17.846
I know.

43:20.390 --> 43:22.183
I use it to pick up girls.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.019
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:28.523 --> 43:30.191
Oh, come on!

43:38.533 --> 43:40.076
- You see this?
- I see it.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.246
That one had your name on it.

43:43.413 --> 43:45.123
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.335
You don't even know my name.

43:48.710 --> 43:52.047
That's right. I don't know your name.

43:53.673 --> 43:54.883
You smoke?

43:57.510 --> 43:58.553
Nope.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.520
Thanks.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.732
It's the least I can do for you,
after saving my life.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.568
Have a couple more.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.862
- What is it?
- Painkillers.

44:19.449 --> 44:20.742
Hot water.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.078
Shit!

44:23.912 --> 44:24.954
What're you doing?

44:25.121 --> 44:26.414
- Sorry.
- You're crazy.

44:26.623 --> 44:29.334
Relax. Here, this is the cold water.

44:35.715 --> 44:36.841
Better?

44:38.343 --> 44:39.552
Let's stitch you up.

45:07.956 --> 45:09.249
Get out of here!

46:21.196 --> 46:22.530
No.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.036
I know who you are.

46:28.203 --> 46:29.370
Really?

46:31.247 --> 46:34.167
You're that guy you always
hear stories about.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.378
You kill drug dealers.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.380
Do you know Bucho?

46:40.840 --> 46:43.968
I hope you don't think
you can take Bucho alone.

46:44.219 --> 46:46.387
- You know him?
- Yeah.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.350
I have a few friends I can call.

46:50.558 --> 46:51.726
They owe me a favor.

46:53.561 --> 46:54.854
Don't complain.

46:55.188 --> 46:58.858
That would be straight if you hadn't
been moving so much.

46:59.567 --> 47:00.860
That one's worse.

47:01.069 --> 47:02.403
Who did that one?

47:02.779 --> 47:04.781
I did, a long time ago.

47:12.205 --> 47:14.541
I don't want to know what that is.

47:18.586 --> 47:21.756
Saved my life more than once.

47:23.508 --> 47:24.551
You can have it.

47:25.093 --> 47:27.971
No, thanks.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.764
No, I'm okay.

47:33.101 --> 47:34.394
Will you help me?

47:39.107 --> 47:41.109
I don't think I can help you.

47:41.276 --> 47:42.318
Okay.

47:43.069 --> 47:45.446
I must leave my things here
for a few minutes.

47:46.114 --> 47:48.449
Oh, okay.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.286
- I can trust you, right?
- Yeah.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.038
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.290
All right.

47:55.456 --> 47:56.958
Where're you going?

47:57.125 --> 47:59.127
I have to go to church.

47:59.752 --> 48:00.795
What for?

48:01.087 --> 48:02.797
Confess my sins.

48:03.298 --> 48:05.967
- I'm a sinner.
- I know.

48:12.599 --> 48:13.933
Did I thank you?

48:14.475 --> 48:15.977
No, you didn't.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.771
Okay.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.106
I Will.

48:37.957 --> 48:40.627
Bucho, what do you think?

48:41.669 --> 48:43.129
Bulletproof windows...

48:43.338 --> 48:44.672
...sidings...

48:44.964 --> 48:46.007
...the hood.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.344
Just what you asked for.

48:52.805 --> 48:53.848
Listen...

48:54.515 --> 48:57.894
...there are no more pickups today,
except one in Hidalgo.

48:58.186 --> 48:59.395
Stay away from there.

48:59.687 --> 49:03.483
The rest of the town is game.
Take this car and find him!

49:03.733 --> 49:06.903
<i>- I'll</i> take my truck.
- Take the car. That's why I got it.

49:07.195 --> 49:08.863
If you see a stranger...

49:09.155 --> 49:12.033
...kill him. I can't take
any more chances.

49:17.205 --> 49:18.706
The sunroof's bulletproof.

49:18.915 --> 49:21.834
Works as a shield
when shooting out the top.

49:22.043 --> 49:23.503
Look at this guy.

49:29.384 --> 49:32.053
It works. Now go and get him.

49:34.764 --> 49:38.768
I want you to take her.
You'll need all the help you can get.

49:53.658 --> 49:54.701
You too.

50:23.813 --> 50:27.108
Bless me, Father, for I have
just killed quite a few men.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.818
No shit.

50:29.736 --> 50:32.947
From what I hear, you cleaned out
the entire Tarasco Bar.

50:33.197 --> 50:36.701
Nice job. Every hit man
in Coahuila's looking for you.

50:36.951 --> 50:38.411
Things got out of hand.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.788
I said no more bloodbaths.

50:41.080 --> 50:44.000
I told you. Bucho's the last one.

50:45.209 --> 50:46.252
Then I'm finished.

50:46.461 --> 50:49.922
No, I'm finished.
They killed the woman you loved.

50:50.131 --> 50:51.966
Then they shot through your hand.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.218
Two points. Wake up!

50:54.469 --> 50:56.929
There is no payback for that.

50:58.347 --> 51:00.641
Walk away.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.226
Trust me...

51:02.393 --> 51:05.813
...this is one you won't
want to see through to the end.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.108
What do you mean?

51:09.817 --> 51:13.654
I've done some checking, and Bucho
is not someone to mess with.

51:13.863 --> 51:14.947
Trust me.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.742
I cannot leave without Bucho.

51:17.992 --> 51:20.870
You don't expect to live much longer?
Fine. I do.

51:21.162 --> 51:22.622
If you need any more help...

51:22.830 --> 51:23.998
...don't call me.

51:24.165 --> 51:26.667
Call Campa and Quino.
They're crazy.

51:26.959 --> 51:29.170
I should be able to count on you!

51:29.462 --> 51:31.130
Those days are gone.

51:31.547 --> 51:33.508
Just wait! Come on!

51:33.800 --> 51:36.010
Good luck. Don't get shot.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.639
Did you want confession?

51:43.267 --> 51:46.187
Maybe later, Father.
Because where I am going...

51:46.479 --> 51:48.564
...I'd just have to come right back.

52:04.372 --> 52:05.581
Hello.

52:11.838 --> 52:13.214
Yeah.

52:15.675 --> 52:17.051
Look...

52:18.427 --> 52:21.347
...I didn't call about it before
because“.

52:22.223 --> 52:23.432
...I could handle it.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.062
Yes, he's got no place to go.

52:28.896 --> 52:30.857
I got my men on him right now.

52:32.441 --> 52:34.235
You brought someone in?!

52:34.527 --> 52:36.404
How long has he been here?

52:36.904 --> 52:38.573
Who is he?

52:40.074 --> 52:43.077
What are you talking about?
We can handle it.

52:43.578 --> 52:46.122
Someone like that will
just tear the place up...

52:46.414 --> 52:48.374
...will make a lot of noise.

52:51.586 --> 52:53.421
What does your guy look like?

52:56.215 --> 52:59.594
I've got to know, or the wrong people
might get killed.

53:00.094 --> 53:04.223
Next time I'll call sooner,
but I knew I could handle this--

53:04.432 --> 53:06.017
Hello? Hello?

53:06.183 --> 53:07.268
Shit!

53:10.897 --> 53:13.441
What's the number
to the phone in my car?

53:15.401 --> 53:18.237
Fuckheads, what's the number
to my car phone?!

53:18.613 --> 53:19.739
Number!

53:22.950 --> 53:24.619
It's in your car, boss.

53:43.387 --> 53:47.183
What's the fucking number
to the phone in my car?

53:52.647 --> 53:54.065
Fuck.

53:56.692 --> 54:00.488
- What are you doing? Get away.
- You can't go away like this.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.657
I need you.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.826
I dreamt about her again.

54:06.035 --> 54:07.203
So what!

54:09.914 --> 54:11.707
- Listen to me! Shit!
- What?

54:13.709 --> 54:14.919
You are right.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.463
You are right.

54:19.632 --> 54:20.841
Maybe I should quit.

54:21.300 --> 54:25.012
Now you're talking some sense,
because let me tell you...

54:25.304 --> 54:28.182
...you keep this up
and it'll be over real quick.

55:07.388 --> 55:09.056
Get in!

55:15.896 --> 55:17.148
Watch it!

55:26.365 --> 55:28.576
Where is he? We got to kill him.

56:19.210 --> 56:21.462
It's me again.

56:21.629 --> 56:25.466
The man you sent in--
What does he look like?

56:26.092 --> 56:29.303
Just so that I know.
So my people don't get confused.

56:30.596 --> 56:33.140
Dark hair, dark skin.
I figured that.

56:33.474 --> 56:35.309
Can I have a few more details?

56:36.143 --> 56:37.478
Tattoo on his chest.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.982
Tattoo of a woman on his chest.

56:42.191 --> 56:43.984
What else?

56:44.527 --> 56:45.653
AW Weapons'?

56:45.903 --> 56:47.530
Throwing knives.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.449
And...?

56:51.492 --> 56:55.663
And pay-phone money so he can
call you with progress reports.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.165
Yes, okay.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.167
That should do it, thanks.

57:00.960 --> 57:02.294
Yeah.

57:02.503 --> 57:04.380
We'll stay out of his way.

57:05.005 --> 57:06.215
Yeah, thank you.

57:10.219 --> 57:11.262
Fuck!

57:11.512 --> 57:15.641
This is what I was talking about.
Our own people are watching us.

57:15.850 --> 57:18.435
He's been here since this morning,
checking on us.

57:19.562 --> 57:20.980
Bastards.

57:21.147 --> 57:22.356
Go find him.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.025
Go and find who?
There's no one else.

57:25.234 --> 57:29.363
He is claimed as a Colombian.
They won't admit they're after you.

57:29.864 --> 57:33.951
There's someone else out there.
And I want to find him now.

57:34.201 --> 57:35.536
Who else is there?

57:35.870 --> 57:37.204
The guitar player?

57:37.413 --> 57:38.873
The guy is a myth.

57:39.206 --> 57:42.209
- A myth.
- You are not a believer.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.545
That will be your downfall.

57:44.753 --> 57:47.590
I'm going with you.
I can't leave this up to you.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.260
Now my ass is on the line.

58:08.569 --> 58:11.739
Manito. Why aren't you practicing?

58:12.239 --> 58:14.950
I told you, man.
Every day, all day.

58:15.826 --> 58:17.453
I can't play this guitar.

58:19.205 --> 58:20.247
Come on.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.749
Where are you going?

58:22.082 --> 58:23.959
Rm going to get my guitar.

58:24.585 --> 58:25.753
I'll wait here.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.630
It's right over there.

58:28.631 --> 58:29.924
What's over there?

58:30.090 --> 58:33.260
My guitar. I want to show you
I've been practicing.

58:43.270 --> 58:44.480
Stupid kid.

59:13.133 --> 59:16.011
Stay there.
No one else is supposed to be here.

59:21.642 --> 59:23.310
See? Here it comes.

59:39.868 --> 59:42.288
See? Now this one I can play.

59:52.715 --> 59:54.216
Don't even think about it.

59:56.010 --> 59:57.177
Give me the guitar.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.805
The guitar!

1:00:02.683 --> 1:00:04.143
Go away.

1:00:11.900 --> 1:00:13.068
Shit.

1:00:23.537 --> 1:00:25.456
This your father's guitar?

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:29.460
Is this why he doesn't work now?

1:00:29.710 --> 1:00:31.712
They switch guitars every few days.

1:00:31.879 --> 1:00:33.213
What do you get?

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:36.925
My father doesn't have to work.
He watches TV.

1:00:37.134 --> 1:00:38.635
He says they hide it all over.

1:00:38.844 --> 1:00:41.597
Ladies with baby carriages,
the church...

1:00:41.889 --> 1:00:43.932
...bookstores. Ask Carolina.

1:00:44.141 --> 1:00:46.435
She'll tell you.
She does the same thing.

1:01:04.286 --> 1:01:05.746
What? Jesus.

1:01:05.996 --> 1:01:07.915
- What did you tell him?!
- Who?

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:10.918
- You work for him, right?
- I work for nobody.

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:13.003
I want to know what you said!

1:01:13.253 --> 1:01:14.671
- Nothing.
- Nothing?!

1:01:14.922 --> 1:01:17.966
- What are you talking about?!
- You said I was at church!

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:21.095
- I haven't said anything to anybody!
- Look at me now!

1:01:21.387 --> 1:01:22.679
You're protecting him!

1:01:22.930 --> 1:01:23.931
- I'm not!
- You are!

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:27.101
If I was, I would've
told him you were here!

1:01:27.434 --> 1:01:30.270
- You don't want him dead!
- I want no one dead!

1:01:30.437 --> 1:01:32.648
You should see
killing him is not the answer.

1:01:32.815 --> 1:01:34.525
See? You know what I see?

1:01:34.775 --> 1:01:36.985
I see you are no better than he is.

1:01:38.821 --> 1:01:40.406
The same shit!

1:01:47.413 --> 1:01:48.664
Anybody can be bought.

1:01:48.956 --> 1:01:50.290
Not anybody.

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:51.834
You're so good, huh?

1:01:52.126 --> 1:01:54.420
You see this bookstore? It's mine.

1:01:54.628 --> 1:01:56.964
Somebody comes
and drops something off.

1:01:57.214 --> 1:01:59.049
- A couple of days later...
- How much?

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:00.926
...somebody else comes
to pick it up.

1:02:01.093 --> 1:02:02.136
I rent space!

1:02:02.302 --> 1:02:04.138
- That's all I do.
- How much?!

1:02:04.304 --> 1:02:07.307
- The back room.
- How much does he pay you?

1:02:11.645 --> 1:02:15.357
- Fifty thousand dollars a year.
- Fifty thousand dollars.

1:02:18.277 --> 1:02:19.319
Cash.

1:02:29.163 --> 1:02:32.207
Look at you. You're a mess again.
Come here.

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:43.177
On the counter.

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:51.977
I didn't open this place
just to see it fail.

1:02:52.186 --> 1:02:54.897
It wasn't making any money.
I would've had to close.

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:58.775
One day, Bucho walks in
with a suitcase full of money...

1:02:59.026 --> 1:03:01.528
...and says to me,
"Carolina, take this...

1:03:01.737 --> 1:03:03.530
...and go about your business...

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:06.742
...and I will give you $50,000 a year."

1:03:11.079 --> 1:03:13.415
They've done it with
a lot of people here.

1:03:13.624 --> 1:03:16.043
They use our business as fronts.

1:03:16.627 --> 1:03:19.713
I used some of the money
to keep this place open.

1:03:19.922 --> 1:03:22.216
And I stashed the rest, thinking...

1:03:22.549 --> 1:03:23.926
...if some day...

1:03:24.218 --> 1:03:26.637
...things got really bad here...

1:03:26.887 --> 1:03:28.931
...I'd have the money to leave.

1:03:29.765 --> 1:03:31.308
But I can't leave.

1:03:32.267 --> 1:03:34.937
Because once you're in,
you can't get out.

1:03:35.229 --> 1:03:37.898
The closest thing I had to a brother...

1:03:38.398 --> 1:03:40.067
...was just killed.

1:03:41.068 --> 1:03:43.612
I cannot stop what it is I have to do.

1:03:44.404 --> 1:03:45.614
I cannot

1:03:48.033 --> 1:03:49.701
Damn it!

1:03:58.252 --> 1:03:59.920
Do you need some help?

1:04:00.128 --> 1:04:02.422
No. I was trying to move my...

1:04:03.048 --> 1:04:04.550
...my cash register.

1:04:05.425 --> 1:04:07.094
I needed a new one anyway.

1:04:16.603 --> 1:04:18.063
So...

1:04:18.772 --> 1:04:20.107
...what brings you here?

1:04:20.649 --> 1:04:23.193
I don't come around much anymore,
do I?

1:04:25.279 --> 1:04:26.572
No.

1:04:28.115 --> 1:04:29.449
How've you been?

1:04:29.783 --> 1:04:31.118
Been okay.

1:04:31.577 --> 1:04:32.703
Business?

1:04:32.953 --> 1:04:34.621
Business is good.

1:04:36.623 --> 1:04:38.458
About as good as it can be.

1:04:40.127 --> 1:04:42.629
I told you, bookstores...

1:04:44.965 --> 1:04:46.383
Not in this town.

1:04:47.342 --> 1:04:48.635
And you?

1:04:53.307 --> 1:04:57.185
I'm looking for someone
that's threatening our business.

1:04:57.394 --> 1:04:59.813
You may have heard
about the bar today.

1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:02.608
Oh, yeah. There was a shooting.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:06.028
Have you seen anyone around
that may look--

1:05:06.278 --> 1:05:07.738
Suspicious?

1:05:13.827 --> 1:05:14.995
No.

1:05:18.498 --> 1:05:19.708
Fuck.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.754
The guy I'm looking for
is obviously dangerous...

1:05:26.340 --> 1:05:29.009
...so I'm not asking you
to confront him...

1:05:30.177 --> 1:05:32.346
...but if you see him...

1:05:34.848 --> 1:05:36.350
...will you call me?

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:38.518
Sure.

1:05:42.230 --> 1:05:43.273
I mean...

1:05:52.157 --> 1:05:54.785
...we can't have any more shootings.

1:05:56.745 --> 1:05:57.954
No.

1:06:04.544 --> 1:06:06.213
But I haven't seen him.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.304
You...

1:06:14.554 --> 1:06:16.098
...wouldn't lie to me...

1:06:16.390 --> 1:06:19.559
...would you, Carolina?

1:06:24.189 --> 1:06:25.232
No.

1:06:30.070 --> 1:06:31.905
That's some mess you've got.

1:06:33.281 --> 1:06:34.700
Yeah.

1:06:38.245 --> 1:06:39.579
I better clean it up.

1:06:41.581 --> 1:06:43.709
Thank you for the coffee. Call me.

1:06:43.959 --> 1:06:45.293
Yes...

1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:48.088
...if I see him...

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:50.674
...I'll be sure to call you.

1:06:53.969 --> 1:06:55.429
<i>Call me.</i>

1:07:01.435 --> 1:07:02.686
Was that him?

1:07:02.894 --> 1:07:06.231
You're not doing anything to him here
or we'll both be killed.

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:08.608
And I don't want to die over this.

1:07:10.193 --> 1:07:11.987
Stay away from the window.

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:08.752
This one's not so bad.

1:08:13.173 --> 1:08:15.550
Actually, it's almost straight.

1:08:18.011 --> 1:08:19.763
Why didn't you tell him...

1:08:20.013 --> 1:08:21.473
...I was here?

1:08:23.850 --> 1:08:25.060
I don't know.

1:08:27.187 --> 1:08:29.856
I know you think
he's a terrible person.

1:08:31.566 --> 1:08:33.151
Honey, he is.

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:36.530
He is.

1:08:37.864 --> 1:08:39.533
Not really.

1:08:40.158 --> 1:08:41.868
He's got a good side to him.

1:08:42.035 --> 1:08:44.788
And that's the only thing
that can save him.

1:08:46.581 --> 1:08:47.916
Yeah.

1:08:50.669 --> 1:08:51.878
What is this?

1:08:52.712 --> 1:08:54.381
That was for you.

1:08:54.714 --> 1:08:56.383
It was for me?

1:08:56.675 --> 1:08:58.426
It's not for me anymore?

1:08:59.594 --> 1:09:01.388
Okay, you can have it.

1:09:05.433 --> 1:09:08.728
I didn't get you a case,
since you already have one.

1:09:08.937 --> 1:09:10.897
It's beautiful. Thank you.

1:09:11.189 --> 1:09:12.691
And I was thinking maybe...

1:09:12.899 --> 1:09:16.903
...you can clear out the guns
and put this in instead.

1:09:18.405 --> 1:09:19.447
Maybe.

1:09:20.574 --> 1:09:22.951
- Play something.
- No.

1:09:23.243 --> 1:09:25.078
Come on, let me help you.

1:09:28.582 --> 1:09:30.083
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful.

1:09:30.584 --> 1:09:31.751
It's okay.

1:09:32.419 --> 1:09:34.588
No, I can't play anymore.

1:09:35.130 --> 1:09:38.258
- Why?
- Well, look at my hand. it's...

1:09:39.759 --> 1:09:42.721
- I can't.
- We can improvise.

1:09:42.929 --> 1:09:45.432
-Improvise?
- Yeah.

1:09:47.392 --> 1:09:48.476
Do you play?

1:09:50.645 --> 1:09:51.938
A little.

1:09:53.648 --> 1:09:54.774
All right.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:01.573
That's not even a note.

1:10:02.449 --> 1:10:04.159
Let me show you.

1:10:04.451 --> 1:10:06.494
Put these fingers over here.

1:10:06.870 --> 1:10:08.079
Like this?

1:10:08.788 --> 1:10:10.624
Good. That's nice.

1:10:10.916 --> 1:10:12.083
Let me see.

1:10:27.599 --> 1:10:29.142
All right.

1:12:31.139 --> 1:12:32.223
Memo...

1:12:32.724 --> 1:12:34.225
...he's in the bookstore.

1:12:34.768 --> 1:12:36.269
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

1:12:38.063 --> 1:12:42.233
Check it out anyway. If he's in there,
and she's hiding him...

1:12:42.442 --> 1:12:43.777
...kill them both.

1:12:44.110 --> 1:12:46.029
Make it look like an accident.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.074
It's a bookstore.

1:12:49.282 --> 1:12:50.784
Burn it down.

1:15:05.376 --> 1:15:06.586
Move!

1:15:09.088 --> 1:15:11.382
Come on! Hurry!

1:15:11.925 --> 1:15:14.177
- Take this!
- Do what?

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:17.180
Take this!
Come on, move.

1:15:18.097 --> 1:15:19.098
Come on!

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:21.559
- What!
- I must get my purse!

1:15:21.768 --> 1:15:22.810
Fuck it!

1:15:25.438 --> 1:15:27.690
Wait! Wait!

1:15:28.483 --> 1:15:29.776
Here.

1:15:32.779 --> 1:15:34.280
You look great.

1:15:35.615 --> 1:15:36.741
Thank you.

1:15:38.493 --> 1:15:39.577
Where're we going?

1:15:39.786 --> 1:15:41.287
Downstairs, out the front.

1:15:41.496 --> 1:15:42.538
Take this.

1:15:49.837 --> 1:15:51.339
Jesus Christ!

1:15:53.549 --> 1:15:56.719
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?!

1:15:58.221 --> 1:15:59.722
Get out of here!

1:16:10.149 --> 1:16:11.234
Let's go!

1:16:44.309 --> 1:16:46.144
Go! Go! Go!

1:17:09.709 --> 1:17:10.793
You Okay?

1:17:43.076 --> 1:17:45.078
I'm sorry, Carolina.

1:17:46.746 --> 1:17:48.247
I'm sorry.

1:17:56.964 --> 1:17:59.258
- That's him.
- What?

1:18:01.719 --> 1:18:02.929
That's Bucho?

1:18:15.942 --> 1:18:18.152
I can shoot him from here.

1:18:21.364 --> 1:18:22.448
Motherfucker.

1:18:46.681 --> 1:18:47.765
What?

1:18:54.021 --> 1:18:55.815
What are you doing?

1:18:55.982 --> 1:18:57.984
Shoot him. Shoot him!

1:19:00.194 --> 1:19:02.155
My whole life was in there.

1:19:06.826 --> 1:19:08.286
Can't you see?

1:19:08.494 --> 1:19:10.997
Can't you see? He's going to kill me.

1:19:11.164 --> 1:19:12.331
Come on!

1:19:13.541 --> 1:19:14.584
Damn!

1:19:19.464 --> 1:19:20.882
Hey.

1:19:21.132 --> 1:19:24.552
What's wrong?
You had the perfect chance!

1:19:24.719 --> 1:19:27.555
What's the matter?
Why didn't you shoot him?

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:36.272
Come on.

1:19:36.731 --> 1:19:37.815
Come on.

1:19:39.358 --> 1:19:40.443
Come on!

1:19:51.704 --> 1:19:53.206
Wait a minute!

1:20:03.591 --> 1:20:04.967
It's one thing...

1:20:05.176 --> 1:20:08.471
...if you can't find someone
running around the city...

1:20:09.055 --> 1:20:11.182
...hiding anyplace he chooses.

1:20:11.766 --> 1:20:13.559
I can understand that.

1:20:13.768 --> 1:20:16.354
Now what I can't understand is...

1:20:16.687 --> 1:20:20.358
...how can you let him get away
when you knew where he was?

1:20:21.234 --> 1:20:22.568
You drive around town...

1:20:22.735 --> 1:20:25.154
...you see someone you don't know,
shoot them.

1:20:25.321 --> 1:20:26.906
How hard is that?

1:20:38.584 --> 1:20:39.919
Look over there.

1:20:42.922 --> 1:20:43.923
I don't know him.

1:20:45.132 --> 1:20:46.801
Never seen him before.

1:20:47.677 --> 1:20:49.554
<i>A QM“!</i>

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:51.305
It must be him.

1:20:54.642 --> 1:20:56.602
Now, how hard is that?

1:20:59.522 --> 1:21:01.274
It's that easy.

1:21:08.739 --> 1:21:11.284
Look! Who are those guys?

1:21:11.534 --> 1:21:13.160
I've never seen them.

1:21:20.293 --> 1:21:21.836
Now, how hard is that?

1:21:25.590 --> 1:21:26.841
Bang!

1:21:27.008 --> 1:21:29.969
Can you handle that?
Or I got to do everything myself?

1:21:30.136 --> 1:21:31.304
I'll handle it.

1:21:32.972 --> 1:21:34.640
Bet your ass you will.

1:21:35.057 --> 1:21:37.935
Take my car!
That's what I bought it for!

1:21:39.770 --> 1:21:40.980
Stay here.

1:21:41.147 --> 1:21:43.691
I need someone competent
guarding this place!

1:21:46.319 --> 1:21:47.445
Hurry UP!

1:22:17.892 --> 1:22:20.227
I wasn't always like this.

1:22:21.354 --> 1:22:23.022
I can see that.

1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:33.824
I was a musician.

1:22:35.034 --> 1:22:36.369
Were you any good?

1:22:36.911 --> 1:22:38.371
I was okay.

1:22:42.375 --> 1:22:44.126
They shot my hand.

1:22:46.212 --> 1:22:47.254
You know...

1:22:48.547 --> 1:22:51.884
...it's easier to pull the trigger
than play guitar.

1:22:54.053 --> 1:22:56.722
Easier to destroy than to create.

1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:03.646
They killed the woman I loved.

1:23:07.650 --> 1:23:09.360
They ruined my life.

1:23:13.531 --> 1:23:16.075
Bucho's men were responsible for it.

1:23:25.459 --> 1:23:28.170
Why didn't you kill Bucho?

1:23:28.796 --> 1:23:29.922
All right...

1:23:31.966 --> 1:23:33.426
...here's the plan:

1:23:35.928 --> 1:23:39.223
You can still get away
without me having to kill him.

1:23:40.725 --> 1:23:41.809
You have money.

1:23:42.101 --> 1:23:43.477
There is no money.

1:23:44.603 --> 1:23:46.939
- What?
-It's gone.

1:23:47.106 --> 1:23:49.483
I had it hidden in the books.

1:23:49.942 --> 1:23:51.110
It burned.

1:23:51.444 --> 1:23:52.945
Oh, shit.

1:23:54.196 --> 1:23:56.741
I have nothing. Nothing.

1:23:56.949 --> 1:23:58.117
Oh, great.

1:23:58.576 --> 1:23:59.785
Shit!

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:08.294
What about calling your friends?

1:24:10.254 --> 1:24:11.464
Campa.

1:24:13.007 --> 1:24:14.133
Quino.

1:24:15.843 --> 1:24:17.428
They'd destroy the city.

1:24:17.636 --> 1:24:20.306
Bucho would still get away. Forget it.

1:24:33.319 --> 1:24:35.613
It may not matter to you...

1:24:37.323 --> 1:24:40.659
...but he'll follow me everywhere I go
until I'm dead.

1:24:41.535 --> 1:24:42.995
It does matter to me.

1:25:07.144 --> 1:25:08.270
Campa?

1:25:09.772 --> 1:25:11.190
Is Quino there?

1:25:14.026 --> 1:25:17.154
How fast can the two of you
get to Santa Cecilia?

1:25:17.363 --> 1:25:18.823
I'll be looking for you.

1:25:19.532 --> 1:25:20.574
Thanks.

1:25:22.701 --> 1:25:23.744
Campa...

1:25:25.162 --> 1:25:26.664
...bring your guitars.

1:26:00.239 --> 1:26:01.907
Give me the strength...

1:26:02.366 --> 1:26:04.034
...to be what I was.

1:26:06.078 --> 1:26:08.247
And forgive me for what I am.

1:27:33.999 --> 1:27:35.626
Back together again, eh?

1:27:35.793 --> 1:27:37.378
Yeah.

1:27:40.130 --> 1:27:41.298
Let's Ma)'-

1:30:40.227 --> 1:30:41.311
Cover yourself!

1:30:46.024 --> 1:30:47.359
Fuck!

1:32:40.305 --> 1:32:42.766
I'm not sure this is the place.

1:32:43.308 --> 1:32:45.018
This is the place.

1:32:53.652 --> 1:32:55.279
I'm going with you.

1:33:26.810 --> 1:33:27.853
<i>Manito.</i>

1:33:30.355 --> 1:33:32.357
What are you doing here?

1:33:34.151 --> 1:33:37.195
I thought I was looking
for the devil himself.

1:33:39.489 --> 1:33:43.035
And all this time
it was my own brother.

1:33:47.039 --> 1:33:49.333
I didn't know it was you.

1:33:49.833 --> 1:33:52.044
I only found out this morning.

1:34:01.219 --> 1:34:03.722
I ought to kill you right now.

1:34:04.348 --> 1:34:05.891
You disgraced me.

1:34:06.183 --> 1:34:08.560
We always knew
you were up to no good.

1:34:08.810 --> 1:34:10.395
Never thought you'd go this far.

1:34:10.562 --> 1:34:12.856
So my little brother comes here...

1:34:13.065 --> 1:34:14.316
...to teach me a lesson.

1:34:14.566 --> 1:34:16.735
Show me what's right from wrong.

1:34:17.736 --> 1:34:19.571
You are a guitar player.

1:34:19.863 --> 1:34:23.408
What are you doing killing my men,
ruining my business?!

1:34:23.700 --> 1:34:25.535
They killed the woman I loved.

1:34:25.744 --> 1:34:28.080
You killed them! What do you want?

1:34:28.580 --> 1:34:30.707
I don't set out to kill innocent people.

1:34:30.916 --> 1:34:32.751
You just buy innocent people.

1:34:33.251 --> 1:34:34.586
You don't kill them...

1:34:34.836 --> 1:34:36.713
...until you have no use for them.

1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:40.759
Isn't she the woman you love now?

1:34:40.967 --> 1:34:42.928
When we take away something...

1:34:43.136 --> 1:34:44.763
...we replace it.

1:34:45.263 --> 1:34:47.391
She's a real piece of work.

1:34:47.599 --> 1:34:49.393
Trust me. I know.

1:34:49.601 --> 1:34:50.894
Sorry about the bookstore.

1:34:51.061 --> 1:34:53.105
I always said
it would go up in smoke.

1:34:53.772 --> 1:34:56.525
Had I known it was my brother
you were fucking...

1:34:56.691 --> 1:34:59.111
-...I'd have acted differently.
- Cesar...

1:35:00.445 --> 1:35:02.864
...I've learned to read the eyes of men.

1:35:03.073 --> 1:35:04.866
What do you read in mine?

1:35:05.617 --> 1:35:07.452
Defeat, brother.

1:35:08.286 --> 1:35:10.997
Defeat? Look at you.

1:35:11.748 --> 1:35:13.750
You came here to kill me.

1:35:14.126 --> 1:35:16.294
Papa wouldn't be proud
of you anymore.

1:35:16.586 --> 1:35:18.797
<i>You were his little guitarrista.</i>

1:35:19.005 --> 1:35:20.465
His little mariachi.

1:35:21.299 --> 1:35:22.467
And now...

1:35:22.676 --> 1:35:24.970
...just a piece of shit like me!

1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:28.181
You want to kill me'?

1:35:28.473 --> 1:35:29.808
Let me tell you something.

1:35:30.100 --> 1:35:31.893
You have already killed me.

1:35:32.978 --> 1:35:34.896
Put your hands up, manito.

1:35:37.315 --> 1:35:38.400
Let's go.

1:35:38.608 --> 1:35:39.651
Put them up!

1:35:42.779 --> 1:35:44.322
I'm sorry.

1:35:44.489 --> 1:35:47.784
But I can't have you acting heroic
when I punish Carolina...

1:35:47.993 --> 1:35:49.202
...for betraying me.

1:35:49.453 --> 1:35:51.663
But let me do this
and we'll be even.

1:35:52.122 --> 1:35:53.915
Clean slate.

1:35:54.332 --> 1:35:56.418
You killed my men. Okay.

1:35:56.626 --> 1:35:57.794
What's done is done.

1:35:58.295 --> 1:35:59.963
I'm finished anyway.

1:36:00.172 --> 1:36:01.465
But now...

1:36:02.466 --> 1:36:03.842
...I kill Carolina.

1:36:05.802 --> 1:36:07.846
And you get to watch.

1:36:17.564 --> 1:36:18.857
Goodbye, Carolina.

1:36:28.033 --> 1:36:29.868
<i>Everyone I've killed...</i>

1:36:31.536 --> 1:36:33.371
...was someone's father...

1:36:34.706 --> 1:36:36.458
...someone's son...

1:36:39.252 --> 1:36:41.046
...someone's brother.

1:36:54.226 --> 1:36:55.268
Practice.

1:37:12.619 --> 1:37:13.995
Where are you going?

1:37:17.290 --> 1:37:18.625
I don't know.

1:37:36.434 --> 1:37:37.644
Carolina?

1:37:39.729 --> 1:37:41.022
Did I thank you?

1:37:43.108 --> 1:37:44.109
No.

1:37:47.279 --> 1:37:48.446
I Will.

1:38:30.614 --> 1:38:31.823
So...

1:38:32.324 --> 1:38:34.659
I want you to thank me right now.

1:38:55.805 --> 1:38:57.015
Thank you.

1:39:24.376 --> 1:39:26.044
Just in case.

1:39:27.712 --> 1:39:30.048
It's a long ride to the next town.
