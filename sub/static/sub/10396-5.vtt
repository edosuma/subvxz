WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:09.642
And vacation over as he... we
headed home to our regular

00:09.643 --> 00:14.047
beds, our daily lives of school
and homework and ordinary

00:14.048 --> 00:14.282
things.

00:14.283 --> 00:18.651
Maybe my little brother, maybe I

00:18.652 --> 00:20.387
would wake up and look out the

00:20.388 --> 00:25.892
window at the night sky and
suddenly it would fill with

00:25.893 --> 00:30.463
stars and golden mist, and we'd

00:30.464 --> 00:32.732
pretend for a second we were

00:32.732 --> 00:36.836
somehow deep inside the milky

00:36.837 --> 00:44.611
way, a million winking lights,

00:44.612 --> 00:49.182
but we knew where
we really were.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.683
We were almost home.

01:35.963 --> 01:41.968
O enchanted land of my
childhood, a cultural petry dish

01:41.969 --> 01:45.705
from which regularly
issues forth greatness.

01:45.706 --> 01:50.477
New Jersey, in case you didn't
know it, has got beaches,

01:50.478 --> 01:52.212
beautiful beaches, and they're

01:52.213 --> 01:57.350
not all crawling with raging
trolls with reality shows.

01:57.351 --> 02:01.921
I grew up summering on those
beaches and they're awesome.

02:01.922 --> 02:09.196
Jersey's got farmland,
beautiful bedroom communities.

02:09.197 --> 02:14.667
Even the refineries, the endless

02:14.668 --> 02:19.906
clover leaves of turnpikes and

02:19.907 --> 02:21.708
expressways somehow beautiful.

02:21.709 --> 02:29.709
To know Jersey is to love her.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.689
Ft. Lee, you may
have heard of it.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.459
Some of governor Christie's

02:39.460 --> 02:43.129
minions allegedly conspired
to jam up traffic a few days.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.198
It's a town with a joky history

02:45.199 --> 02:51.204
of corruption, it's also
where my beloved Hiram's is.

02:51.205 --> 02:54.707
Opened since 1932 and unchanged

02:54.708 --> 02:56.643
since, my dad started bringing

02:56.644 --> 02:58.545
me and my younger brother here

02:58.546 --> 03:01.147
in the 50s and they
still honor tradition.

03:01.148 --> 03:06.553
Sometimes I just the
need that old flavor.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.121
It seems like a chew food.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.991
Basically my dad
would take me here.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.927
It is a great point of pride and

03:14.928 --> 03:16.229
satisfaction and I've convinced

03:16.230 --> 03:20.400
my daughter this is the
finest hot dogs in the land.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.067
She gets very excited to come

03:21.068 --> 03:25.171
out here, which makes me happy.

03:25.172 --> 03:25.639
Thank you.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.306
Thank you.

03:26.307 --> 03:26.839
This is heat.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.343
The toothpicks are
just like 1958.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.246
Some things just
shouldn't change.

03:33.247 --> 03:38.851
My dad used to love relishing
that I loved this stuff.

03:38.852 --> 03:45.592
Look at that beauty.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.959
Oh, yeah.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.365
I come here to feed my soul, the

03:52.366 --> 03:55.602
cultural wellspring
that's new Jersey.

03:55.603 --> 04:00.473
It's the antidote to
every other place.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.608
The place is perfect.

04:01.609 --> 04:07.947
The dogs are amazing.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.017
There are not a lot of people in

04:11.018 --> 04:19.017
this world courageous
enough to not change.

04:24.298 --> 04:29.469
Down the shore, yeah, we
actually talk like that.

04:29.470 --> 04:34.173
It was what we did,
go down the shore.

04:34.174 --> 04:37.377
Not just our family from Bergen

04:37.378 --> 04:41.213
county near the bridge, but
families and working-class

04:41.214 --> 04:44.984
families from all over who
packed up the kids in the

04:44.985 --> 04:52.158
station wagon for the
intermable trip to long island.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.993
There was always drama.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.430
Once we were over the bridge,

04:57.431 --> 04:59.332
the excitement would ratchet up.

04:59.333 --> 05:06.506
Ship bottom, then surf city,
love ladies, ticking off the

05:06.507 --> 05:14.013
town names until finally,
finally, Barnegat light.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.114
New.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.416
These are all new.

05:16.417 --> 05:16.949
That's original.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.018
Yeah, definitely.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.521
I think I know who lived
there at one point.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.922
That's definitely old school.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.223
Let's face it.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.593
It's been how many years?

05:26.594 --> 05:30.029
40... 400, I think.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.564
Jesus, we're old.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.700
The lighthouse.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.736
Definitely remember going
to that lighthouse a lot.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.206
Definitely the good old days.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.541
I want some fried clam strips.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.208
Absolutely.

05:42.209 --> 05:45.812
Our options are limited,
shall we say, but holy crap.

05:45.813 --> 05:50.417
This place is filling up.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.420
I think it's because
it's the only place.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.121
Who lives out here year round?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.056
We're about to see every
single one of them.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.326
Let's be honest.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.762
When we came here in the sum
summers, I was the bad one.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.730
Yes, yes.

06:03.731 --> 06:08.300
Your recollection is correct.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.770
I didn't smoke dope for
the first time here.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.906
I was looking for dope, but as a

06:13.907 --> 06:15.508
12-year-old it was
hard to come by.

06:15.509 --> 06:22.081
I remember you vaguely walking
off with some sort of

06:22.082 --> 06:22.349
cute girl.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.850
First kiss.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.451
This is good.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.852
It is good.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.021
I realize now I
hitchhiked regularly.

06:29.022 --> 06:29.922
Yeah.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.024
Mom, dad, I'm going to go to

06:32.025 --> 06:38.330
ship bottom tonight
with some friends.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.331
How are you getting there?

06:39.332 --> 06:39.633
Hitchhiking.

06:39.633 --> 06:39.833
Okay.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.634
Have fun.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.537
That's how you got places here.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.673
Summertime.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.941
You know that sound?

06:48.942 --> 06:54.180
Just out of the water, eared
pressed up against the beach

06:54.181 --> 07:00.853
blanket, the squeak of bare
feet on sand nearby, classics

07:00.854 --> 07:04.457
illustrated comics waited
for me back at the house.

07:04.458 --> 07:10.129
I'd play with my little plastic
army men in the dunes and

07:10.130 --> 07:12.131
there's a smell of beach
grass in the dunes.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.467
You remember it?

07:14.468 --> 07:15.468
I still crave it.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.036
I love it.

07:17.037 --> 07:21.841
And on special occasions
clams in drawn butter.

07:21.842 --> 07:26.412
I remember this place with
nothing but fondness.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.247
I can't remember a
single bad memory here.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.350
People you knew from
last year we were here.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.185
The parents didn't
need to be with you.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.355
Have a campfire on
the beach at night.

07:36.356 --> 07:43.329
All this stuff they wouldn't
let you do at home.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.831
The beach would look different.

07:44.832 --> 07:48.768
For a couple of days, the beach

07:48.769 --> 07:51.270
would be this weird foamy surf.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.238
Now we're talking.

07:52.239 --> 07:56.509
Or there would be the jelly
fish delivery sometimes.

07:56.510 --> 08:03.182
Infestation of
jelly fish, right.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.919
I try to block that out.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.522
Love the clam strips.

08:09.523 --> 08:09.957
These are great.

08:09.958 --> 08:10.790
These are awesome.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.692
So far, so great.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.293
I'm happy.

08:14.294 --> 08:18.965
Battered piece of fish with
some good tartar sauce.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.201
What were your
favorite activities?

08:22.202 --> 08:25.304
Building a campfire
on the beach.

08:25.305 --> 08:29.375
Firecrackers on the beach.

08:29.376 --> 08:33.212
I have some firecrackers
in your car, by the way.

08:33.212 --> 08:33.547
Just saying.

08:33.548 --> 08:37.216
Set them off at the casino.

08:37.217 --> 08:37.760
Perfect.

08:45.292 --> 08:45.792
♪

08:51.464 --> 08:53.465
It was paradise.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.234
America's first dream vacation.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.236
The beach as far as America was

08:57.237 --> 08:58.337
concerned, meaning bathing suits

08:58.338 --> 09:03.342
and swimming in the surf, was
pretty much invented here.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.277
Atlantic city, rich or working

09:05.278 --> 09:06.445
class, it was here for you.

09:06.446 --> 09:10.282
Back then you dressed up
to walk the boardwalk.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.954
It was capitalism at its
purist and most assertive.

09:14.955 --> 09:20.793
It was a Democratic dream
designed from the beginning for

09:20.794 --> 09:21.594
everybody.

09:21.595 --> 09:28.768
Flashy, utilitarian, upright,
deeply, unapologetically,

09:28.769 --> 09:29.002
corrupt.

09:29.003 --> 09:32.538
In many ways its story a perfect

09:32.539 --> 09:36.175
reflection of changing times.

09:36.176 --> 09:43.349
Established in 1912, the second

09:43.350 --> 09:49.889
floor had curtained alcoves
and a separate lady's lounge.

09:49.890 --> 09:54.026
Vicky's dad was the chief
photographer for Atlantic city

09:54.027 --> 09:56.863
from the 1930s to the 1960s.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.499
He saw it all and by
extension so did Vicky.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.835
What was it like here as a kid?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.737
It was fantastic.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.805
Walking down the boardwalk in

10:05.806 --> 10:10.910
the summertime was like
walking a carnival at midway.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.080
There was still
remnants of the 20s.

10:14.081 --> 10:14.847
Yeah.

10:14.848 --> 10:20.052
Handle bar mustaches,
Victorian graphic art and

10:20.053 --> 10:21.387
illustration was still very much

10:21.388 --> 10:24.924
in evidence, even in my
time here in the early 60s.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.158
The boardwalk was over six miles

10:26.159 --> 10:30.529
of amusements, entertainments,
parades, and pageants.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.565
A never-ending carnival.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.835
Every place you went down the

10:35.836 --> 10:36.903
boardwalk was something else to

10:36.904 --> 10:38.771
see and all the stores were mom

10:38.772 --> 10:40.439
and pop stores, all very unique.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.074
Yes.

10:42.075 --> 10:46.746
The world famous steel pier,

10:46.747 --> 10:50.182
amusement arcades,
salt water Taffy.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.118
I loved the joke shops.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.020
The joke shops.

10:54.021 --> 11:00.126
It was a wonderland of
juvenile delinquency.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.796
It was just something very
sinister and forbidden.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.632
The menu has changed
somewhat since the original.

11:06.633 --> 11:12.438
For me, a very tasty pretzel

11:12.439 --> 11:17.744
crusted swordfish
over lump crab meat.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.146
For Vicky, pan-seared scallops.

11:20.147 --> 11:24.717
Times were not good.

11:24.718 --> 11:29.221
It was largely empty, but it
was a magnificent structure.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.824
You and I like the nostalgia.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.760
The people who like coney island

11:33.761 --> 11:36.062
like it, but I don't know
about the young people.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.899
Beautiful buildings are
beautiful buildings.

11:39.900 --> 11:44.070
A beautiful view is a
beautiful view forever.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.404
There's no other place with this

11:45.405 --> 11:47.907
kind of history and legitimacy.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.242
This place has deep
romantic allure.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.343
I agree with you.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.145
I believe in the
transition that's coming.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.982
I really, really do
with all my heart.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.250
Hundreds of businesses
used to be here.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.453
It's not a matter of, gee, that

12:01.454 --> 12:03.289
would be great if
that happened again.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.492
It is inevitable that
it will happen again.

12:06.493 --> 12:11.297
Atlantic city can be chic easy

12:11.298 --> 12:14.500
because the bones of the
city are beautiful.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.269
I'm glad you feel that way.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.272
A beautiful old restaurant
with really great food is much

12:20.273 --> 12:28.273
more interesting than a
glass box with good food.

12:46.399 --> 12:51.003
The names of Atlantic city
streets were imprinted on

12:51.004 --> 12:56.175
generations of Americas who
grew up playing monopoly.

12:56.176 --> 13:00.312
You see history, the ebb and
flow of America's hopes and

13:00.313 --> 13:06.152
dreams played out in the
buildings and homes you see as

13:06.153 --> 13:09.021
you pass by.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.390
Cheap takeout, the
footprints of a lost world.

13:11.391 --> 13:16.395
The riviera of the northeast
still there if you look in

13:16.396 --> 13:16.663
between.

13:16.664 --> 13:20.499
With jet travel in Miami and an

13:20.500 --> 13:23.102
expanded highway system,
things declined as they do.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.839
But a few visionary geniuses
presented a solution, a cure

13:26.840 --> 13:30.009
that would overnight make
everybody well, make Atlantic

13:30.010 --> 13:33.913
city shiny and new and
prosperous again.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.014
Men like Donald Trump.

13:35.015 --> 13:41.420
I think it's going to be
really very beneficial to

13:41.421 --> 13:42.354
everybody.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.857
We look forward to operating the

13:44.858 --> 13:47.526
Taj Mahal for many
years to come.

13:47.527 --> 13:51.630
They rushed to Atlantic city
eager to tap into what was

13:51.631 --> 13:59.631
assured to be a never-ending
gusher of prosperity, casino

14:00.073 --> 14:00.373
gambling.

14:00.374 --> 14:04.410
When casino gambling was sold

14:04.411 --> 14:06.045
to New Jersey and to Atlantic

14:06.046 --> 14:13.152
city as the cure-all,
did it change anything?

14:13.153 --> 14:15.554
Do you think it helped?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.322
No, I don't.

14:16.323 --> 14:20.259
Brian Donohue is with 20
years experience focusing on

14:20.260 --> 14:21.994
south Jersey.

14:21.995 --> 14:27.766
Dock's oyster house, an
establishment that survived

14:27.767 --> 14:31.003
prohibition, two world wars,

14:31.004 --> 14:33.305
numerous declines, and rebirths.

14:33.306 --> 14:39.645
Still here, still great, a
symbol of what Atlantic city

14:39.646 --> 14:44.783
was, should be, and
should be again.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.252
It was seen as an easy answer.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.521
It sure sounded
like a good idea.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.258
They were going to bring 12

14:52.259 --> 14:54.460
casinos here and bring everybody
up from the top down.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.527
It hasn't worked.

14:55.528 --> 14:59.431
When you're left with
just 12 casinos...

14:59.432 --> 15:04.937
If you're looking for an example
of lemming like lurch of

15:04.938 --> 15:07.273
cliff face from which to tumble,

15:07.274 --> 15:12.644
look no further than this
$2.4 million goat rodeo.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.315
It opened in 2012 and closed
less than two years later.

15:16.316 --> 15:23.455
The most expensive casino
in en engine history.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.158
What were they thinking?

15:26.159 --> 15:28.460
Short-term money at a time

15:28.461 --> 15:32.298
when other casinos were opening
all over the east coast.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.966
It's nuts.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.467
It's economics 101.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.470
Casinos, by design, neglect

15:38.471 --> 15:44.810
the city's assets, salt air,
a walk by the glorious north

15:44.811 --> 15:48.747
Atlantic, the classic
attractions, the restaurants.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.316
This is what it is going to

15:50.317 --> 15:51.984
take for Atlantic
city to come back.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.519
It's going to be
places like this.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.853
Celebrate the ghosts.

15:54.854 --> 15:59.425
Some nice crab cakes at dock's,
a big freaking lobster

15:59.426 --> 16:05.331
stuffed with crab imperial,
plum sou souffle.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.666
Those things are bad for
business, the business of taking

16:07.667 --> 16:08.001
your money.

16:08.002 --> 16:10.402
Thank you so much.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.572
That'll work.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.740
That's good.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.874
I don't want to sound like I'm

16:15.875 --> 16:18.677
down on Atlantic city, because I

16:18.678 --> 16:26.678
see it as an incredibly almost
ludicrously hopeful place.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.723
Whatever is left should be hung

16:31.724 --> 16:36.962
onto because it is
going to come around.

16:36.963 --> 16:43.402
There's nothing funny about
losing all your money, yet

16:43.403 --> 16:51.403
casinos are steady employers
of that most hard-working

16:51.778 --> 16:52.644
entertainer.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.414
It's so much money to live here.

16:55.415 --> 16:59.085
I drove three exits on
the Jersey turnpike.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.753
It was $7.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.923
If you drive a whole New Jersey

17:04.924 --> 17:06.392
turnpike, when you get to the

17:06.393 --> 17:09.328
end you have to
give them your car.

17:09.329 --> 17:13.632
I'm going to tell you
something that I don't tell

17:13.633 --> 17:15.733
people right away.

17:15.734 --> 17:19.171
I'm vegan.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.638
I do cheat a little.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.406
I eat veal.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.473
It's so tender.

17:22.474 --> 17:28.414
How do they get it like that?

17:28.415 --> 17:32.518
I'm very sentimental about
Jersey Italian, particularly

17:32.519 --> 17:33.952
spaghetti and meatballs.

17:33.953 --> 17:38.924
I've eaten here at least five

17:38.925 --> 17:43.095
to ten times and I've
never had a bad meal.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.597
I wouldn't get the meatballs.

17:45.598 --> 17:50.602
Proud long-time residents
of New Jersey.

17:50.603 --> 17:56.942
I've lived here for nine years,
but have only been proud

17:56.943 --> 17:57.344
for the last two.

17:57.345 --> 17:59.778
One was the first time you
played Atlantic city?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.847
There was a club at the sands.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.382
Many times I would get paid on

18:03.383 --> 18:04.816
Thursday and then I would lose

18:04.817 --> 18:08.654
it all and then I'd
have to work for free.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.055
There's no worse feeling.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.124
Oh, I know that feeling.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.461
Have you ever watched a
couple in Atlantic city?

18:15.462 --> 18:16.328
Hold this money.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.131
Don't give it back to
me no matter what I do.

18:19.132 --> 18:23.735
An hour later, give
me my god damn money.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.637
You better give me my money.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.974
You're the reason I'm losing,
touching my arm when I'm

18:28.975 --> 18:30.742
shooting craps.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.545
Is there a specifically
Jersey sense of humor?

18:33.546 --> 18:36.982
Yes, I love Jersey
audiences now so much.

18:36.983 --> 18:41.086
I have never one time said
anything where people in the

18:41.087 --> 18:43.322
audience have said, ahhh.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.690
They never get offended.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.692
I have my trigger words.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.561
As a white woman, the
word I don't like is no.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.832
I don't hear it that often,
but when I do huh-uh.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.235
Here's the deal with Jersey.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.938
People land up north and
they drive up the turnpike.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.207
Refineries.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.741
That's New Jersey.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.744
How sick is it that I
think it's beautiful?

19:05.745 --> 19:12.618
More horses per capita
than any other state.

19:12.619 --> 19:20.619
I worked for an
embroidery company.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.429
I swear to god.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.031
I'll call her right now.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.200
Will people ever come across

19:28.201 --> 19:31.136
the bridge and the tunnel
in the other direction?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.404
No.

19:32.405 --> 19:32.605
No?

19:32.605 --> 19:32.805
Okay.

19:32.806 --> 19:35.707
I did not have to
think about that.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.310
Let's go out to a
club in Jersey.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.212
It's all relative.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.215
A 6-year-old person is going I'm

19:43.216 --> 19:45.384
getting the [ Muted
] out of this city.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.553
There's your answer.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.554
Never going to be you.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.556
Where does hipness stop?

19:50.557 --> 19:53.292
Hipness is overrated.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.727
Yeah, it is overrated.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.062
I love living here.

19:57.063 --> 20:01.166
Pine valley, the best golf
course in the country.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.569
Trump... trump, I'm not a fan.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.671
Who is?

20:05.672 --> 20:13.672
Every minute that he walks,
the man has a certain... it's

20:19.286 --> 20:21.820
like if you have
a disfigurement.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.789
That's too much to ask
of me in trump's case.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.923
I want to screen.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.693
Do you know why he puts his
names on the building?

20:27.694 --> 20:31.930
So the banks know which
ones to take back.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.299
At least he's a humble guy.

20:33.300 --> 20:33.800
Jesus.

20:51.784 --> 20:57.689
There are few American cities,
places where things have

20:57.690 --> 21:02.461
gone as disastrously wrong
as Camden, New Jersey.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.364
It's like a poster child for

21:05.365 --> 21:07.065
everything a city can screw up.

21:07.066 --> 21:13.405
Once a manufacturing power
house, home to the New York

21:13.406 --> 21:18.744
shipbuilding company,
a company town.

21:18.745 --> 21:23.214
About 80,000 people
live here today.

21:23.215 --> 21:30.088
That's the same number of
people employed in its heyday.

21:30.089 --> 21:33.659
The entire police force
replaced by the state.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.994
More than 1/3 of city residents

21:35.995 --> 21:40.566
live below the poverty line.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.067
Voter turnout not good.

21:41.068 --> 21:43.335
If there's any place one can be

21:43.336 --> 21:44.570
forgiven for just throwing your

21:44.571 --> 21:49.775
hands up in the air and
giving up, it's here, but no.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.878
Cities with serious problems

21:52.879 --> 21:56.682
need extraordinary people and
Tawanda Jones is clearly an

21:56.683 --> 21:57.683
extraordinary person.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.852
When you give, especially to

22:00.853 --> 22:04.623
someone who is really in need,

22:04.624 --> 22:08.760
you know, I feel... it
makes me feel complete.

22:08.761 --> 22:12.364
Her late grandfather Walter

22:12.365 --> 22:17.302
green Jr. was a
former military man.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.471
He was just like the protector.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.874
If you need anything, you go to Mr.
Dynamite.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.876
That was his nickname.

22:24.877 --> 22:30.416
When Tawanda was 15, she was
asked to lead a local drill

22:30.417 --> 22:31.383
team.

22:31.384 --> 22:35.053
Unfortunately, it soon
lost his funding.

22:35.054 --> 22:43.054
Walter purchased uniforms and
drums to get it its start.

22:46.132 --> 22:49.401
Today CSS, the Camden
sophisticated sisters drill

22:49.402 --> 22:54.440
team, which includes the
distinguished brothers in taps,

22:54.441 --> 22:56.942
the almighty percussion sound,

22:56.943 --> 23:00.946
have over 320 participants.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.014
Good job, babies.

23:03.015 --> 23:03.749
Good job.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.084
Clap it up for yourself.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.321
Clap it up.

23:10.322 --> 23:15.761
We meet at stalwart
Tony and Ruth steaks.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.297
What was Camden like back
in the good ole days?

23:19.298 --> 23:19.965
Oh, my god.

23:19.966 --> 23:27.966
It was so different when...
Coming up when I was younger.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.941
That sense of community
was strong back then.

23:29.942 --> 23:34.780
You were talking about your
childhood as if it was a real

23:34.781 --> 23:39.451
long time ago.

23:39.452 --> 23:39.985
What the hell went wrong?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.521
People can blame it on the

23:42.522 --> 23:44.490
politics, but I think
that's too easy.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.657
Know what your child is doing.

23:45.658 --> 23:51.563
You're putting it
principally on the parents.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.163
Absolutely.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.865
This is tasty.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.568
This is delicious.

23:56.569 --> 24:00.405
So the conventional wisdom
seems to be get out of Camden.

24:00.406 --> 24:01.707
Why are you still here?

24:01.708 --> 24:04.342
Because the need is
still in Camden.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.712
If every decent person leaves

24:06.713 --> 24:09.515
Camden, then we never a chance.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.749
In order to be a part of the

24:10.750 --> 24:14.686
program, they have to maintain
a C average or better.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.922
It's all about the academics.

24:16.923 --> 24:21.026
It's all about
nurturing these kids.

24:21.027 --> 24:27.766
What's right, what's wrong.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.034
They believe this.

24:29.035 --> 24:33.204
They say it so much
until it is embedded.

24:33.205 --> 24:41.205
Tawanda has helped support it
with financial assistance.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.182
Surprisingly with a group of a

24:44.183 --> 24:52.183
national profile no lasting
support from official

24:52.291 --> 24:54.392
organizations public or private.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.861
Yet she perseveres.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.029
We've been under
Bridges, everything.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.965
Over 28 years, we've
been outside.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.301
Their safety is the most
important to me, but it's been a

25:03.302 --> 25:04.202
blessing and a curse.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.872
You'll have the corner boys come

25:06.873 --> 25:08.607
up and ask you are you having

25:08.608 --> 25:12.578
practice outside today,
today is not a good day.

25:12.579 --> 25:12.879
Okay.

25:12.879 --> 25:13.145
All right.

25:13.146 --> 25:14.112
Thank you very much.

25:14.113 --> 25:14.780
That's nice.

25:14.781 --> 25:15.947
I appreciate it.

25:15.948 --> 25:16.548
Trust me.

25:16.549 --> 25:19.885
How do you keep the
kids off the corner?

25:19.886 --> 25:21.452
I'm quite aware that times

25:21.453 --> 25:23.388
are hard, but I just try to show

25:23.389 --> 25:25.223
them an alternative route.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.059
There's so much more
out there than this.

25:28.060 --> 25:32.397
Some call me major pain,
but it's all out of love.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.265
They need to discipline in life

25:34.266 --> 25:36.568
to go to work, to go to school.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.571
They're doing it
because it's fun.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.238
Right.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.172
But it's hard.

25:41.173 --> 25:41.973
Yeah.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.341
You're asking people to do a

25:43.342 --> 25:44.610
hard thing and they're doing it.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.111
Yeah.

25:45.112 --> 25:49.748
And I got to ask, I'm going
to guess in the years that

25:49.749 --> 25:53.084
you've been doing this you've

25:53.085 --> 25:55.754
had to have had your
heartbroken many times.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.455
You've had to see kids that

25:57.456 --> 25:59.257
you've really believed in fall

25:59.258 --> 26:02.127
by the wayside and
I'm guessing a lot.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.161
How do you go on?

26:03.162 --> 26:06.164
We have a lot of sad stories,

26:06.165 --> 26:08.767
but our good outweighs the bad.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.002
I keep going just
for that reason.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.271
You know, before I was a little

26:13.272 --> 26:17.275
hard on myself and I used to

26:17.276 --> 26:20.111
think that I could save all the

26:20.112 --> 26:23.448
kids, I know that's
not the case.

26:23.449 --> 26:27.452
I just do the best
that I can do.

26:27.453 --> 26:31.790
And I just pray the next kid
doesn't fall by the wayside.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.225
How do you not become cynical?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.461
Do you harden your heart?

26:36.462 --> 26:42.300
No, actually I have to
replenish myself or I'm not

26:42.301 --> 26:46.071
going to be good to
them or my own family.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.205
These kids are
precious cargo to me.

26:47.206 --> 26:51.677
Some of them have the
responsibility of a

26:51.678 --> 26:52.144
30-something-year-old.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.345
They're holding
down their homes.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.848
25 years down the road, what

26:56.849 --> 26:58.083
do you think Camden
is going to be like?

26:58.084 --> 26:59.651
I'm praying that it turns

26:59.652 --> 27:04.589
into the Camden that I remember,

27:04.590 --> 27:05.824
and I know that I'm helping our

27:05.825 --> 27:08.059
future leaders to become
a part of that change.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.494
There's no doubt in my mind that

27:09.495 --> 27:11.262
there's going to be
a positive Camden.

27:11.263 --> 27:11.731
No doubt.

27:11.732 --> 27:13.031
You're going to say?

27:13.032 --> 27:15.333
I'm not going anywhere.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.235

27:17.236 --> 27:23.408
I'm not leaving.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.111
Yeah, I know.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.412
Philadelphia is
right over there.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.448
Right across the Ben
Franklin bridge.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.118
The center of the Cheesesteak

27:33.119 --> 27:36.121
universe, but what if it isn't?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.422
They're better than that.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.190
They're bigger than that.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.961
And the best Cheesesteak in the

27:42.962 --> 27:45.964
area might well come
from new Jersey.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.534
Donkey's opened by Leon
Lucas 71 years ago.

27:49.535 --> 27:53.705
A heavyweight contender in the

27:53.706 --> 28:01.706
Olympics in boxing he was known

28:02.281 --> 28:07.118
in his time of the
Calvary as the donkey.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.387
This is what they do here.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.323
Behold the Jersey Cheesesteak.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.325
Pleasure to meet you.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.929
So this is the best
Cheesesteak in south Jersey,

28:17.930 --> 28:19.297
unless I'm mistaken?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.799
New Jersey.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.802
New Jersey, period?

28:23.803 --> 28:24.937
Yeah.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.072
Is there a difference?

28:27.073 --> 28:34.813
We do ours on a round
Poppy seed roll.

28:34.814 --> 28:35.914
It's round.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.750
It's got steak, spices, browned

28:38.751 --> 28:40.018
onions, real American cheese,

28:40.019 --> 28:42.520
such as it is, and
a Poppy seed roll.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.089
Fantastic.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.157
Thank you, sir.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.495
Hot pepper.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.196
A little bit?

28:51.197 --> 28:53.331
I drove a long way for this.

28:53.332 --> 28:57.302
Thinking about it the whole way.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.939
Man, this should be like
national landmark right away.

29:00.940 --> 29:04.709
This sandwich is
unbelievably good.

29:04.710 --> 29:04.977

29:13.352 --> 29:13.985
Wow?

29:13.986 --> 29:16.687
That's treason.

I am actually.

men come and go.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.471
outsized their dreams, how badly

39:00.472 --> 39:04.609

sea will outlast us.

39:08.079 --> 39:12.082

edges, when necessary it will

completely oblivious to

metaphor here.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.366
I hate sweets.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.769
But I'm a sucker for nostalgia.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.170
You can't go back.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.638
I can't go back.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.207
How I wouldn't, even if I could.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.478
I sure don't want to ever
have to be a teenager again.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.812
But those tastes and smells of

40:14.813 --> 40:17.482
childhood, they work still.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.317
You're telling me you were not
a big saltwater Taffy fan.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.319
I remember it was hard to chew.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.488
You had braces, remember?

40:23.489 --> 40:25.456
This was probably
problematic for it.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.558
I can't remember having
braces at that point.

40:27.559 --> 40:31.496
These have a
mystical hold on me.

40:31.497 --> 40:33.030
Even the color of the wrapper

40:33.031 --> 40:35.032
has this weird, you know, like

40:35.033 --> 40:38.336
there should be music
playing in the background.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.074
Molasses, I remember that.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.210
Getting a bunch of those.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.211
I don't know why.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.080
Certain flavors really resonate.

40:50.081 --> 40:55.820
The peanut, I know exactly
what that tastes like.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.489
I remember the vanilla
really powerfully.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.824
I'm not even a vanilla guy.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.227
I'm more of a chocolate guy.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.995
I think I remember pink ones.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.432
They must have had strawberry.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.868
Winter green I remember.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.437
Licorice sounds good.

41:13.438 --> 41:14.438
Peppermints.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.707
Keep these in the car.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.374
Cookies and creme.

41:17.375 --> 41:20.778
Does it melt?

41:20.779 --> 41:22.046
That's a lot of Taffy.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.448
Yeah.

41:24.449 --> 41:25.883
This stuff isn't bad for you.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.251
Eat as much as you want.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.786
Is it gluten free?

41:28.787 --> 41:30.020
It's all natural.

41:30.021 --> 41:38.021
That's what I thought.

41:47.305 --> 41:50.474
Atlantic city will never die.

41:50.475 --> 41:55.212
Good is indeed good forever.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.616
And Atlantic city
will be great again.

41:58.617 --> 42:06.617
Asbury park, Camden,
all of my home state.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.795
I'm convinced when the tide has

42:10.796 --> 42:12.563
come and washed all the greed

42:12.564 --> 42:19.103
heads away, we'll
once again be magic.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.073
I hope I'm there to see it.
