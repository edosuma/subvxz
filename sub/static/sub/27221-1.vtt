Australia is...

06:51.950 --> 06:52.950

06:54.040 --> 06:54.870
Well...

06:55.040 --> 06:55.750
Do I really need to

06:55.870 --> 06:56.620
say it out loud?...

06:56.790 --> 06:57.500
for you to open your eyes

06:57.700 --> 06:58.080

four.. five.. months?

07:00.450 --> 07:01.250
and not a single action

07:01.330 --> 07:02.000
has been taken by the

07:02.120 --> 07:03.120
COPs or the government?

07:03.410 --> 07:04.410
Students are the cash cows

07:04.580 --> 07:05.330
in this economy...

07:05.500 --> 07:06.200
So Mr. Sharma...

07:06.370 --> 07:07.370
I take that as a yes...

07:07.620 --> 07:08.620
you feel this country

07:08.870 --> 07:09.870
is racist?...

07:10.370 --> 07:11.370
Yes...

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
I... I do

07:12.910 --> 07:13.910

07:14.000 --> 07:14.700

07:23.450 --> 07:24.450
So in your opinion..

our dear friend Jaydeep,

09:11.290 --> 09:12.000
is not the first Indian attack

tomorrow it could be him

09:13.750 --> 09:14.500
or myself..

09:14.750 --> 09:15.750
and people like her..

09:16.450 --> 09:17.620
still won’t call it racism

09:17.750 --> 09:18.370
Ahh..

09:18.620 --> 09:19.910
That’s a very strong statement,

09:20.250 --> 09:21.250
Mr. Sharma..

09:21.830 --> 09:23.120
These could just as easily be

but actually,

we are the ones working for them!..

09:38.200 --> 09:39.500

09:39.790 --> 09:40.790
It’s just another form of

09:41.040 --> 09:42.040
exploitation.

09:42.330 --> 09:43.330
What do you mean by that?

09:43.540 --> 09:44.120
Well..

09:44.330 --> 09:45.120
students are drawn here

09:45.290 --> 09:46.290
in the name of education.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
It’s an open secret,

09:47.750 --> 09:48.750
these Indian students have

09:49.040 --> 09:50.000
big loans to pay off,

09:50.250 --> 09:51.250
very easy motive to

09:51.450 --> 09:52.540
skin us for more work and

09:52.790 --> 09:53.700
pay us little or nothing

09:54.000 --> 09:54.870
Exactly..

09:55.290 --> 09:56.290
Now you’re talking..

09:56.870 --> 09:58.580
Mr Sharma, I’m here to report

09:58.950 --> 10:00.370
on this side of the story

10:00.700 --> 10:01.700
Oohh..

10:02.910 --> 10:03.910
look Maria,

10:04.410 --> 10:05.410
the authorities

10:05.660 --> 10:06.660
have to take responsibility

10:07.290 --> 10:08.290
and immediate action

10:08.540 --> 10:09.540
Well, I agree!..

10:09.910 --> 10:10.790
I completely agree

10:10.910 --> 10:11.200
but..

10:11.370 --> 10:12.040
hang on.. hang on.

10:12.200 --> 10:12.830
but I do have a couple of more

10:13.000 --> 10:13.620
questions?..

10:13.830 --> 10:14.450
ooh..!

10:16.370 --> 10:16.910
Aah...

10:17.080 --> 10:17.790
I’m sorry Maria,

10:17.910 --> 10:18.500
but we’ll have to wrap

10:18.660 --> 10:19.200

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Umm..

11:41.370 --> 11:42.700
After I finished my

11:43.000 --> 11:43.700
Masters in India,

11:43.870 --> 11:44.450
I was..

11:44.660 --> 11:45.450
really lucky to get a

11:45.700 --> 11:46.370
scholarship here

11:46.700 --> 11:47.700
A scholarship?

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Congratulations!..

11:49.290 --> 11:50.080
You must have extremely

11:50.290 --> 11:51.290
proud parents, right?

11:52.040 --> 11:53.040
What do they do?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.160
They were both teachers..

11:56.620 --> 11:57.790
they’re retired now.

11:57.950 --> 11:58.950
The reason I,

11:59.160 --> 12:00.700
wanted to meet with you today

12:01.500 --> 12:02.910
is because I’m doing research

12:03.040 --> 12:04.080
on the recent violence against

12:04.250 --> 12:05.830
Indian students for "The Truth’,

12:06.080 --> 12:06.910
my newspaper..

12:07.160 --> 12:07.750
Ohh yeah..

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
you, mentioned that..

12:09.200 --> 12:10.000
That’s right,

12:10.330 --> 12:11.120
Can I ask?

12:12.040 --> 12:13.040
have you experienced

12:13.290 --> 12:14.660
any discrimination so far?

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
Discrimination?

12:22.330 --> 12:23.080
Umm..

12:36.410 --> 12:38.120
one of the deprived caste

12:38.450 --> 12:40.000

12:40.950 --> 12:41.830
yes...

12:42.040 --> 12:42.870
I am...

12:43.120 --> 12:44.790
an untouchable.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.200
In the Indian caste system,

12:47.450 --> 12:48.660
it is important to remember

12:48.870 --> 12:49.870
your caste.

12:50.200 --> 12:50.950
So,

12:51.250 --> 12:52.790
the society can fit you.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.330
This practice

12:54.660 --> 12:56.120
exists from ancient time

12:56.410 --> 12:57.580
to the modern

12:57.870 --> 12:59.290

12:59.620 --> 13:01.250

13:02.000 --> 13:02.830

13:03.080 --> 13:04.080
of Gujurat state.

13:04.290 --> 13:05.540
Me and my wife...

13:05.790 --> 13:07.410
are the only two people

13:07.660 --> 13:08.540
from 'Tundel',

13:08.790 --> 13:10.410
who made it through education

13:10.620 --> 13:11.620
and got a government job

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
as a teacher.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120

13:26.450 --> 13:28.000

13:28.370 --> 13:29.830
then we are punished.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.330
In the year 1965,

13:32.830 --> 13:34.540
it was my father

13:34.830 --> 13:36.330
and a few brave soul

13:36.620 --> 13:37.750
who encouraged me

13:38.040 --> 13:39.040
to stand my ground

13:39.200 --> 13:39.910
to say...

13:40.160 --> 13:41.160
enough!

13:41.750 --> 13:43.450
There was no turning back

13:43.660 --> 13:44.660

for the truth.. so,

21:39.660 --> 21:40.660
No offence but

21:41.870 --> 21:42.830

21:43.120 --> 21:44.450
admit their crimes to each other

21:44.620 --> 21:45.540
let alone an..

21:45.750 --> 21:46.410
outsider.

21:47.160 --> 21:47.450
It,

21:47.660 --> 21:48.700

It’s more than obvious

Jaydeep,

26:40.330 --> 26:41.950
the majority of Australians

26:42.250 --> 26:42.950
find this violence

26:43.330 --> 26:44.330
very disturbing.

26:44.790 --> 26:45.790
I’m inclined to think that

these attacks aren’t

How do you know?

26:50.540 --> 26:51.580
Have you ever been in a
