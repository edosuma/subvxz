you're not allowed

I feel extra guilty

the full truth.

-I didn't wanna tell anybody.
-You're scaring me.

08:26.542 --> 08:30.626
James bumped my nose one week
after I got the cast off.

08:30.626 --> 08:33.459
How? What do you mean,
he bumped your nose?

08:33.459 --> 08:37.501
He went in really quick
and really fast for a kiss.

08:37.501 --> 08:38.709
-In pain and in shock--
-What kind of kiss is this?

08:38.709 --> 08:42.292
That doesn't make sense to me.

08:42.292 --> 08:44.501
-He went in so hard.
-No--

08:44.501 --> 08:47.125
Has anybody hit you?

08:47.125 --> 08:48.834
-Hit me?
-Yes.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.667
-Like physically like a punch?
-Yes.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.125
-No. No.
-Okay, so it--

08:53.125 --> 08:54.626
And I wanna get that out
of your head...

08:54.626 --> 08:56.209
-Okay. Well--
-...because that did not happen.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.918
I know it doesn't look...great,

08:58.918 --> 09:03.083
but James created
a reputation for himself.

09:03.083 --> 09:06.042
He's had a history
of blowing up on people.

09:06.042 --> 09:09.000
You're a ----ing lying slut,
and you ----ed everybody at SUR.

I didn't want people
to jump to conclusions.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.792
James' whole family was there.
They saw it. They can testify.

09:20.792 --> 09:24.125
Okay, I believe you.
I believe you. I believe you.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.000
I looked at James' mom,
and I said, "Is it okay?"

09:26.000 --> 09:27.751
And she said,

09:27.751 --> 09:29.834
"It looks like your nose
is touching your cheek."

09:29.834 --> 09:33.959
James flipped out.
He flipped out.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.876
He knew he ----ed up. He felt
so guilty in that moment

09:36.876 --> 09:38.959
that he, like, took that anger
out on his mom.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.459
It was horrible.

09:40.459 --> 09:42.667
Well, because she said
it didn't look okay?

09:42.667 --> 09:43.292
Mm-hmm.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.918
This gives me cause for concern

09:45.918 --> 09:49.584
because again,
it's James' raging.

09:49.584 --> 09:52.709
And I think for the most part,
there's been so much improvement

09:52.709 --> 09:56.042
because of his sobriety,
but he's not there yet, clearly.

09:56.042 --> 09:59.125
Well, I wish you'd told me this
before I spoke to my friend.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.459
I feel like a bloody idiot
sitting there,

10:00.459 --> 10:03.083

"She took the Band-Aid off,

10:03.083 --> 10:04.667
and the nose is going
at this angle,"

10:04.667 --> 10:06.000
when now you tell me
something different.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.459
You believe the reason that
your nose is going to your left

10:10.459 --> 10:13.042
is because he bumped it?

10:13.042 --> 10:14.584
I think so.

10:14.584 --> 10:17.959
Okay, let's just go

a big deal."

41:38.584 --> 41:40.125
I'm going to start ----ing...

41:40.125 --> 41:42.083
Aah!

41:42.083 --> 41:44.250
Raquel's out of that round,
so now we're gonna continue.

41:44.250 --> 41:45.834
Let's see
how far we keep going.

41:45.834 --> 41:46.626
-All right. Cypress Hill.
-All right, uh...

41:46.626 --> 41:48.501
[mocking voice]
Ooh, Cypress Hill.

41:48.501 --> 41:50.375
-Oh.
-Kid Cudi.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.000
-Lil Yachty.
-Sorry you guys are so dumb,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.584
you can't figure it out.
I don't know.

41:53.584 --> 41:55.000
-[gasps] We are not dumb.
-Sorry, babe.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.501
Yeah, I don't ----ing
need this. It's fine.

41:58.501 --> 42:00.125
-No, Raquel!
-No!

42:00.125 --> 42:01.584
-Raquel.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:01.584 --> 42:03.459
-Raquel, no!
-You can't call us dumb.

42:03.459 --> 42:05.876
Well, sorry, but you were just
making fun of the whole fact

42:05.876 --> 42:07.959
that I said "Cypress Hill"
and carried on the game.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.334
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Actually--

42:09.334 --> 42:11.542
-No, we're okay.
-Chill, dude.

42:11.542 --> 42:14.042
James, come on, man.

42:14.042 --> 42:17.083
We're not stupid.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

42:17.083 --> 42:19.876
Was that a bit much?

42:19.876 --> 42:22.459
♪♪♪

42:22.459 --> 42:25.667
Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:25.667 --> 42:27.501
Right now, Greg--
we haven't really been able

42:27.501 --> 42:29.292
to fully sell him on it.

42:29.292 --> 42:31.709
He's, like, "Listen, guys,
if you can't sell this to me,

42:31.709 --> 42:33.417
like, I can't move forward
with you."

42:33.417 --> 42:34.709
-What?
-He's getting to that point.

42:34.709 --> 42:36.334
Our mission statement is what
are we trying to accomplish

42:36.334 --> 42:37.542
and how are we gonna
accomplish it?

42:37.542 --> 42:40.000
It's like a what is this place?
What do you do there?

42:40.000 --> 42:41.042
What's it good for?

42:41.042 --> 42:43.417
You can switch places
with them right now.

42:43.417 --> 42:45.209
I've heard, obviously,
from Katie

42:45.209 --> 42:48.542
that you have a lot
of pent-up issues with me.

42:48.542 --> 42:52.209
You decided to be
a mean girl ----ing bitch.

42:52.209 --> 42:54.125
What if I went
and botched my nose?

42:54.125 --> 42:56.000
I would wanna make sure
that you were okay.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.209
[bleep] that. No, you wouldn't.
You wouldn't ----ing end up

42:57.209 --> 42:59.542
---ing probably leaving me
eventually.

42:59.542 --> 43:03.542
Is that what you would do to me?
