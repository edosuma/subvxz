WEBVTT

00:04.270 --> 00:05.604
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:08.507
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:12.044
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:16.482
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:18.217
To save herself and her people,

00:18.219 --> 00:21.520
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.156
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:25.791
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:28.027
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:31.130
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:37.403
If mary weds my son,
and it causes his death,

00:37.405 --> 00:38.804
As you predicted,

00:38.806 --> 00:40.739
This castle will see violence

00:40.741 --> 00:44.143
Within its walls
like none before.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.577
What if you were legitimized?

00:45.579 --> 00:48.247
You're talking about changing
the line of succession,

00:48.249 --> 00:49.748
And that's the sort of talk

00:49.750 --> 00:52.317
That gets bastards
and mistresses beheaded.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.753
Whatever has been between
us, believe me now,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.755
That I love my son.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.625
I would go into hell for him.
How far will you go?

00:59.627 --> 01:01.727
It seems that we will go
into hell together then.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.595
Mary:
<i>Why did you come back?</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.164
<i>You didn't know</i>
<i>the gold was poisoned.</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:07.266
<i>It was one man against ten.</i>

01:07.268 --> 01:09.435
Why would you do
something so stupid?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.370
Because I love you.
What?

01:11.372 --> 01:13.705
Because it's pretty obvious now
that for us to stay sane,

01:13.707 --> 01:15.407
We need to be together.

01:22.549 --> 01:25.350
It's morning.
I know.

01:25.352 --> 01:28.654
Oh.
If the servants are gossiping
about your unmade bed,

01:28.656 --> 01:32.591
It is too late to rectify
the situation.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.827
(laughing)

01:36.763 --> 01:39.364
Do you think
we're being too reckless?

01:39.366 --> 01:40.799
I'm yours.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.235
You're mine.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.804
I hope you're pregnant.
Francis!

01:45.806 --> 01:47.239
It would force
the wedding sooner.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.707
How could my
father argue it?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.442
You don't think
what we're doing is wrong?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.678
As we are not wed yet?

01:52.680 --> 01:57.716
After we rule for
a great long while,

01:57.718 --> 02:00.119
And we leave France and
scotland to our children,

02:00.121 --> 02:05.224
And our grandchildren and
our great grandchildren,

02:05.226 --> 02:07.659
And we meet our maker,

02:07.661 --> 02:09.228
You can ask
him yourself.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.662
(laughing)

02:10.664 --> 02:13.532
(knocking)
(gasps)

02:13.534 --> 02:14.833
(clearing his throat)

02:14.835 --> 02:16.568
Forgive me, but
there's word for you...

02:16.570 --> 02:18.804
From the holy see.
The pope?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.806
The cardinal from the vatican
is in the throne room.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.774
(sighs)

02:26.312 --> 02:27.779
(laughs)

02:27.781 --> 02:29.381
(laughing)

02:29.383 --> 02:32.751
Or you could ask him now.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.721
As the word
of god is back at court.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.355
(laughter)

02:40.560 --> 02:43.428
You can be honest.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.764
I'd gladly trade pain
for respect.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.666
Aren't you in enough pain?

02:47.668 --> 02:50.269
Aren't I, seeing
you like this?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.738
You've barely been by my side.
You need to rest.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.307
'cause you've been
with her.
(sighs)

02:55.309 --> 02:56.875
Kenna, please.
I hear the rumors.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.443
I ask the servants.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.412
Diane's been seen
in your room.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.247
She gives me counsel.
She's my friend.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.349
Can we please
forget about diane?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.318
Can you? Henry.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.786
(sighs)

03:07.788 --> 03:09.354
Henry, please
look at me.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.956
Tell me the truth.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.658
Tell me that you love me.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.428
I can't let her go.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.465
I'm sorry. You wanted honesty.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.269
I came back to the
horrors of this attack.

03:24.271 --> 03:28.440
A stranger with an old vendetta
who came to destroy my line.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.610
They came for your sons, but
they attacked me because of my

03:31.612 --> 03:33.979
Association to you.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.315
Because you made me
your mistress.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.483
I nearly died because of you,

03:38.485 --> 03:42.287
And you choose this moment
to tell me that you want her?

03:42.289 --> 03:46.291
I don't know if she's a habit,
or a crutch, but I need her.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.994
I've given you everything.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.396
My virtue.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.365
I'm... I'm destroyed.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.801
Oh, that's simply not true.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.269
Kenna, when we
started this,

03:57.271 --> 03:59.338
You knew I had a
wife and a mistress.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.340
Perhaps it was overreaching
on both our parts

04:01.342 --> 04:03.408
To assume that I
was capable of...

04:03.410 --> 04:05.777
Exclusivity.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.413
So, this is it?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.816
You're through with me?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.485
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.954
We   <i>ca</i>continue.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.993
But if you ask me again to
choose between you and diane,

04:20.995 --> 04:23.462
I'll choose diane.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.401
(bell tolling)

04:37.477 --> 04:39.645
Does the cardinal's visit

04:39.647 --> 04:41.313
Have anything to do with you?

04:41.315 --> 04:43.315
With your plans for me?
No.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.683
I would know in advance,

04:44.685 --> 04:46.585
And the communications
have taken place

04:46.587 --> 04:48.520
In the utmost secrecy.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.455
Legitimization
takes time.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.457
I don't want my brother's job.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.493
Even if the job gets
you the woman you want?

04:54.495 --> 04:55.927
(door closes)

04:55.929 --> 04:57.362
Your majesty.
Your majesty.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.765
She may care

04:59.767 --> 05:02.668
For francis, but mary will
wed the next king of France.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.438
That's no way to win a woman.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.474
It worked for him.
Why not you?

05:16.516 --> 05:18.950
God bless us all.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.423
There is news sent to us
by cardinal tesson,

05:24.425 --> 05:25.724
The papal emissary.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.958
In England,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.427
The tudor queen is dying.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.095
Tesson:
While she has not named

05:30.097 --> 05:31.530
Her successor...

05:31.532 --> 05:32.864
Henry:
Many suspect, and believe,

05:32.866 --> 05:35.500
The rightful heir
to the english throne

05:35.502 --> 05:36.735
Is you, mary stuart.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.638
(applause)

05:44.944 --> 05:48.347
The second England's queen
dies, you will make your claim.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.614
Your marriage to my son
will strengthen that claim,

05:49.616 --> 05:51.083
As it will show the world

05:51.085 --> 05:52.651
That you have the might
of France at your side.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.587
France fulfills its
promise to scotland

05:55.589 --> 05:57.422
And to you.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.359
It's time
you and francis are wed.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.662
(quietly):
No, you can't do that.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.468
We must celebrate.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.570
It's god's will.

06:19.612 --> 06:20.746
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

06:20.748 --> 06:22.013
It's god's will.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.749
(applause)

06:28.621 --> 06:30.922
Am I understanding
this right?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.592
That a new condition of the
alliance, of our marriage,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.427
Is that I deliver
England to you?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.396
My father wants it.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.097
The vatican's support makes him
think he can get it.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.500
Elizabeth has
support, as well.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.603
Armies she's been
gathering for years.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.072
You realize what laying claim
to England could cost me?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.474
Yes, I do.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.777
It could cost you your head.

07:03.623 --> 07:07.559
Henry:
When the english queen dies,
so does henry the viii's line.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.795
You are his next relation
by blood.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.130
Elizabeth is
henry the viii's daughter.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.633
By anne boleyn.
Her parents' marriage

07:14.635 --> 07:16.868
Was never recognized by the
catholic church. She's...

07:16.870 --> 07:18.670
Illegitimate.
Her claim is weak, at best.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.039
In god's eyes,
she doesn't even exist.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.708
How convenient
god has this opinion,

07:23.710 --> 07:25.477
As elizabeth happens
to be protestant.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.678
The pope doesn't want

07:26.680 --> 07:27.946
To lose a nation
to protestantism.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.181
Can you blame him?

07:29.183 --> 07:31.049
A scottish queen
on the english throne?

07:31.051 --> 07:34.219
A daughter born
of one of henry's wives,

07:34.221 --> 07:35.554
Dismissed?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.856
There will be uprisings.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.624
Wars.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.526
Catholics against protestants,
neighbor against neighbor.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.795
England against scotland.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.197
And elizabeth against mary.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.199
Have you thought
about that?

07:47.201 --> 07:50.168
They say she's very cunning,
and that she has many followers.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.237
And she's always perceived mary
as a threat.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.705
She will come after you,

07:53.707 --> 07:54.873
Whether you've reached

07:54.875 --> 07:56.141
For the crown or not.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.009
As for strife,
civil wars, England

07:58.011 --> 07:59.678
Will never be weaker.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.580
What better time to strike?

08:01.582 --> 08:05.650
If they push back,
if there are wars, we will win.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.952
You hate them.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.525
England tore into my
country for half a century.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.161
They spilled french blood
on french soil.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.930
Yes... I hate them.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.932
You can make them ours.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.135
Together, you will some day rule
half of europe.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.572
England, scotland and France.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.708
Don't let fear keep you
from greatness.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.612
This is your destiny.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.984
I want my son married

08:38.986 --> 08:42.854
To England's next queen,
because <i>I</i> want England.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.257
Cost me England,

08:45.259 --> 08:47.659
And I will kill you.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.095
Are we clear?

08:53.933 --> 08:56.635
I know. It's over.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.637
Did the vatican
tell you?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.705
They don't need to.
There's no way

09:00.707 --> 09:02.674
The church can support
a bastard's claim

09:02.676 --> 09:04.209
To the throne in France

09:04.211 --> 09:06.177
When it's crushing a
bastard's claim in England.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.747
I'm sorry.
I'm not.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.782
It was wrong of me to
dangle her in front of you,

09:10.784 --> 09:13.018
To play with
your feelings.
Don't.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.587
You can't want her...

09:15.589 --> 09:18.590
Even in secret,
even in your heart.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.092
Francis will see
your desire for her.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.794
You told me yourself,
he already has.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.296
He forbade me from her.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.764
And what effect did that have?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.699
You and francis-- you talk

09:27.701 --> 09:29.668
As if mary's a cool glass
of water,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.636
And I'm a man dying of thirst.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.138
And it's only our talk
that makes you thirsty?

09:33.140 --> 09:37.042
Do you know why I warn
you, why francis has?

09:37.044 --> 09:40.278
Because there's a thirst
inside her, as well,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.113
For you.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.783
Keep your distance
from her.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.985
No one is worth dying for.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.792
You there,
are these diane's chambers?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.795
Yes, my lady, but she's
not in at the moment.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.630
Well, tell her

09:58.632 --> 10:02.367
That the king's mistress
would very much like a meeting.

10:04.904 --> 10:08.106
My lady, I'm glad
to have found you alone.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.241
Do I know you?

10:10.243 --> 10:14.145
I'm father ronissi, and you,

10:14.147 --> 10:17.015
As I just heard,
are the king's mistress.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.984
How do you do,
madame de poitiers?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.652
You're younger
than I imagined.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.120
I'm the priest

10:22.122 --> 10:23.989
Who has been answering
your letters.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.725
To the vatican?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.326
About your son, sebastian.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.729
Sebastian?
Of course
you would

10:30.731 --> 10:34.199
Want him recognized,
but you must realize,

10:34.201 --> 10:36.868
With the pope's blessing of mary
and francis's wedding,

10:36.870 --> 10:41.306
His desire to service
the faithful of England...

10:41.308 --> 10:43.875
That your efforts must stop.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.746
Mine... And the king's?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.147
The king is completely unaware,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.950
As you'd requested.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.820
I hope you understand.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.023
I'm beginning to.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.759
I mean... Of course.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.061
Thank you.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.102
Are you breathing
easier now?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.738
I still don't want to
go back to the castle.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.774
They'll want answers.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.410
My father didn't pose
our marriage as a question,

11:18.412 --> 11:20.245
But I will.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.313
Do you want this?

11:22.315 --> 11:25.950
I want <i>you,</i>
<i>but I'm afraid.</i>

11:25.952 --> 11:28.219
I don't want
to start a war.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.221
And what if my
efforts fail?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.991
What if no one supports
my claim in England?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.293
Every catholic will.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.429
I know you want time
to sort this out,

11:37.431 --> 11:40.165
To assess what France
and the vatican can offer.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.934
And maybe we have time
before the english queen dies,

11:42.936 --> 11:45.136
Before you have
to stake your claim.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.706
But we are a separate issue.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.908
And this is our chance,
right now, to be together,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.277
Without anyone or anything
standing in our way.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.845
What are you saying?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.880
Marry me.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.817
And we'll figure out

11:58.819 --> 11:59.984
What you should do
with England later.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.786
You mean trick your father,

12:01.788 --> 12:03.988
The king of France, into
believing that I agree with him?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.057
Yes.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.892
(laughs)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.728
We should deceive him.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.396
It's for a very good cause.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.431
About England?

12:13.433 --> 12:17.035
I'll pressure you,
and listen to you,

12:17.037 --> 12:18.503
And argue with you,

12:18.505 --> 12:22.207
And love you
until the day I die.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.776
Together, we'll decide
what is right,

12:24.778 --> 12:26.745
As husband and wife.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.249
Marry me.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.517
Say yes.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.385
(laughs)

12:34.387 --> 12:36.154
Yes. Yes!

12:39.859 --> 12:42.293
(laughs)

12:42.295 --> 12:44.529
(giggling)

12:44.531 --> 12:47.198
♪

13:04.383 --> 13:06.885
(bird singing)

13:22.902 --> 13:24.502
I am sorry, your...
Your majesty.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.005
Lady kenna said
you would be expecting her?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.373
I need a
moment alone.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.874
It would be in both
of our interests

13:29.876 --> 13:32.911
For you to
hear me out.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.313
Oh, god, you look terrible.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.348
I feel for you,

13:37.350 --> 13:39.584
But if this is about henry,
you can't imagine

13:39.586 --> 13:41.820
How little he interests me
at the moment.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.155
It's also
about your son.
Mm.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.826
I can save him
immeasurable pain.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.427
Go.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.833
Is this about the wedding?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.101
The wedding? No,
it's about diane.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.003
Oh. Get out.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.905
Why do you allow her
to live here?

14:00.907 --> 14:02.907
Why do you agree to coexist?

14:02.909 --> 14:06.444
She means nothing to me,
not anymore.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.580
Why, when she took what's yours,
what's now mine?

14:08.582 --> 14:11.449
What does she
have over him?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.550
And why shouldn't
we use information

14:12.552 --> 14:14.018
That I have over her?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.987
Go on.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.457
I think diane plans
to have bash legitimized.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.559
Behind your back,
behind henry's.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.127
It could cost France
everything.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.496
How do you know this?

14:25.498 --> 14:28.099
I was on my way to her room
to confront her.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.267
To say what?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.636
I don't know.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.638
Beg her to give me
a chance, I suppose.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.908
Oh, dear lord,
you really are a child.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.176
I was mistaken for her.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.111
That's when I learned
of her efforts

14:40.113 --> 14:42.013
To have him recognized
by the church.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.448
What else
could that mean?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.649
Her plans have come to naught.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.150
That's what
the emissary told me.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.987
He adores bash,

14:48.989 --> 14:51.623
And obviously, he loves diane.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.893
But he won't like this news,
not now.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.361
Now with England in play.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.563
(laughs)

14:58.565 --> 15:01.366
She's rattling the line
of succession,

15:01.368 --> 15:04.903
Just when France needs
to look very secure.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.906
And undermining
existing rulers?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.374
Well, some might call that
treason.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.242
She could be
executed for this.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.480
Would that take care
of your diane problem?

15:15.482 --> 15:16.681
No, that's not what I want.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.349
And yet, you could live with it.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.387
Ah.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.923
Go.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.559
I'll see what I can do
with this information,

15:28.561 --> 15:31.629
And how it might benefit me.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.564
(door opens)

15:33.566 --> 15:36.000
Hmm. Very good.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.272
Greer:
<i>We're so happy for you.</i>

15:41.274 --> 15:43.074
(laughs)

15:43.076 --> 15:44.475
Lola, what about you?

15:44.477 --> 15:45.710
I'm pleased.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.946
I-I just...
I want you to be safe.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.447
I want you to be sure.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.115
England's an enormous risk.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.951
Are you taking that risk

15:52.953 --> 15:55.620
For us, your people,
or for the man you love?

15:55.622 --> 15:58.723
My duty is to scotland,
and soon, to France.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.960
I will make the decision
that my conscience dictates.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.494
Francis knows that.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.996
But the king's orders...

16:04.998 --> 16:06.998
What the king doesn't know
won't hurt him.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.968
Greer:
He'd defy his father for you?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.736
For us, for his people.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.671
He's a good man.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.207
I'm going to marry him
tomorrow night.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.576
Greer:
Tomorrow?!
Wh...

16:18.578 --> 16:22.613
But what... What
will you wear?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.549
Aylee:
Well... Well,
what about your mother?

16:24.551 --> 16:25.717
She won't be here.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.185
Well, I have all of you.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.619
You're my real family.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.355
Mary, come.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.224
Let's try different
things with your hair.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.060
Up or down? What do you think?

16:36.062 --> 16:38.262
Depends on the veil.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.698
(giggling)

16:46.538 --> 16:49.107
My son doesn't believe
that the future can be seen.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.709
He thinks it's his and mary's
to control.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.745
I've tried to drive her away.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.614
I've tried
to destroy her reputation,

16:56.616 --> 16:57.782
His love for her.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.217
I've terrorized her.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.551
Nostradamus:
Don't do this.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.753
She is an innocent.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.755
No, she's his equal
in every way.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.690
He loves her, she loves him.

17:05.692 --> 17:10.328
What more could I want
for my son except his survival?

17:10.330 --> 17:11.629
There is another way.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.066
Except to remove the very source
of the problem.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.135
Francis will know,

17:17.137 --> 17:19.170
No matter how you
hide your treachery.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.638
He will never
forgive you.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.073
He can hate me
for the rest of his life.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.341
God willing, it's a long life.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.743
If francis won't
listen, tell her.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.546
Tell mary the truth.
Tell her everything.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.814
What, so she can tell others?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.382
The court, the king?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.151
So we can burn for your
dark magic, as heretics?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.752
And for what, nostradamus?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.321
The chance of
changing her own fate.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.824
Of saving the man she loves.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.225
And if I can't convince her?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.729
Then there is no
saving her, is there?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.799
From the content...

17:47.801 --> 17:50.435
Of the bottle in your bag.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.172
But if you kill mary,
we will burn anyway.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.774
In the fires of hell
for all eternity.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.119
(birds singing)

18:10.122 --> 18:12.323
(sighs)

18:12.325 --> 18:14.826
(door opens)

18:18.464 --> 18:21.132
What do you want?

18:22.501 --> 18:24.802
You and I have been
through a great deal together.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.105
I've come to respect you.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.840
Do you think
I'm a stupid woman?

18:28.842 --> 18:30.808
Easily fooled?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.510
No.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.812
And what about nostradamus?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.115
I know that he's told you
about your future.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.516
Do you believe him?

18:38.518 --> 18:41.385
I believe his words have weight,

18:41.387 --> 18:43.454
That he has certain insights.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.822
What does any of this matter?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.858
Nostradamus believes

18:46.860 --> 18:50.161
That some day you will be
the cause of francis's death.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.264
That your marriage
seals this fate.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.734
He's seen the future.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.636
If you wed my son,
it is very dark.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.872
This is madness.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.407
Everything you've
done to drive me away

19:03.409 --> 19:06.811
Has been based on...
On some glimpse of-of a future?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.312
A future that no one can know.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.382
No one except him.
What nostradamus sees

19:11.384 --> 19:14.485
Comes to pass,
I can assure you over the years.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.922
Brutal storms, newborns dying.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.424
Love and war, treachery.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.392
This is mere superstition.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.660
Henry would call it worse.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.328
If you tell the king

19:24.330 --> 19:25.796
What I've done,
and why I've done it,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.632
He'd have grounds
for my beheading.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.434
He'd have nostradamus killed
without a second thought.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.904
I give you a very powerful
weapon against me,

19:32.906 --> 19:35.640
Because I trust
you won't use it.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.341
Instead, you'll do
what needs to be done.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.609
And what is that?

19:38.611 --> 19:39.844
Walk away from this marriage,

19:39.846 --> 19:41.579
From francis.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.916
A man I love, an alliance
that my country needs.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.318
He will die if you marry him.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.955
I know that I'm asking you
to sacrifice,

19:50.957 --> 19:51.923
But if you believe, at all...

19:51.925 --> 19:53.291
I don't.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.759
I don't believe
any of it.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.228
Be very sure of that.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.298
Think about anything
nostradamus has ever told you,

20:00.300 --> 20:01.933
Anything he's ever predicted.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.434
Has it come to pass?

20:03.436 --> 20:07.205
Have you told francis
about this?

20:07.207 --> 20:07.939
He won't believe me.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.373
He deserves at the very least

20:09.375 --> 20:10.641
To know what you believe.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.243
Oh. Is that really why

20:12.245 --> 20:13.778
You would share the prophecy
with him?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.513
Or is it so he could talk you
out of your fears?

20:15.515 --> 20:16.814
Because he will.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.350
Is it so he can
choose his own fate?

20:19.352 --> 20:22.787
Because you know
he'd risk his life for you.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.323
He loves you,
and you love him,

20:25.325 --> 20:27.658
But that love must make you
strong, not weak.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.261
Please don't let it kill him,
I beg of you.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.269
What did you see?
Of francis?

20:38.271 --> 20:39.604
What would make you believe?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.241
And you must believe a little,

20:43.243 --> 20:45.910
Or you'd have run straight
to francis, or to the king.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.381
You told me once

20:50.383 --> 20:52.950
That the lion would fight the
dragon in a field of poppies.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.486
There was truth in that.
Yes, I did.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.256
But that's not
your real question.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.324
Ask it.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.029
Can the future I see for you
and francis be changed?

21:09.568 --> 21:12.036
Yes, it can.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.408
By any other means
than letting him go?
No.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.045
All images of francis's death
are tied to your union.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.283
You will be blamed for the death
of the queen's firstborn.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.419
You will blame yourself,
most of all.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.821
I see francis,

21:30.823 --> 21:33.491
Barely older than he is now,

21:33.493 --> 21:35.593
Cold to your touch.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.329
You are wed
but childless.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.930
Alone at this court.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.332
Without a friend
to comfort you.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.668
Stop. You're cruel.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.037
Do you think I want
to see these things?

21:46.039 --> 21:49.006
Do you think I want to tell
a mother her son will die?

21:49.008 --> 21:53.377
So much sacrifice,
so much slaughter.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.381
One among you, a girl, dead
in a day's time. Do you think...

21:57.383 --> 21:58.649
What do you mean one among us?

21:58.651 --> 21:59.850
Kenna.
Don't listen.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.852
This is meant to scare me,
not you.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.054
You said one among us.

22:03.056 --> 22:04.355
A girl.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.357
Yes. A girl.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.026
I see your ladies,

22:09.028 --> 22:12.330
Circled around.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.432
I don't know who.

22:14.434 --> 22:18.369
But one among you will die
before the next frost melts.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.573
You said that some fates
could be changed.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.108
Not this one.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.785
None of us will die.
It's nonsense.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.454
Nostradamus said I'd fall
in love with a man

22:36.456 --> 22:38.789
With a white mark on his
face. That never happened.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.725
Have you fallen
in love at all?

22:40.727 --> 22:43.427
You disappear for hours.
Where do you go?

22:43.429 --> 22:45.129
He said I'd never
go home again.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.765
It haunts me still.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.967
Greer:
That was his intention.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.802
Nostradamus likes
to scare people.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.437
He's the queen's watchdog.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.905
Well, we can't trust her.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.442
Maybe this is her last attempt
to keep you from francis.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.679
Or she was trying to keep me
from francis to save his life.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.682
I don't know if there's any
truth to this prophecy, but...

23:04.684 --> 23:07.852
The queen and nostradamus seem
to believe what he's saying.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.420
What do you believe?

23:09.422 --> 23:11.021
You said you couldn't sleep
for days after you saw

23:11.023 --> 23:12.523
Tomas' banner unfurl.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.426
And it was a dragon,
as nostradamus predicted.

23:15.428 --> 23:20.030
The lion and the dragon will
fight on a field of poppies.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.400
The lion being
the english

23:22.402 --> 23:25.035
That tomas' soldiers
sailed off to confront.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.771
Sailors. On the sea.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.939
So where was his field
of poppies?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.941
You're right.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.878
But tomas fought
his real battle,

23:33.880 --> 23:36.080
The one he fought himself,
in the forest.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.149
There were poppies
everywhere at that time,

23:38.151 --> 23:39.717
All through the woods.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.419
Where tomas was slain.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.421
By francis.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.722
And bash.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.957
Bash:
<i>You know how tomas died.</i>

23:46.959 --> 23:49.093
And, yes, there were poppies
there. In full bloom.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.461
That's an odd thing to remember.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.463
The mind focuses
on small things

23:52.465 --> 23:55.199
When faced with the larger
horror of taking a life.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.202
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.971
To tell the truth, I-I'm
probably just looking

24:00.973 --> 24:02.807
For connections
that aren't there.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.209
To what end?

24:05.211 --> 24:07.711
Did nostradamus tell you
something you hope is true?

24:07.713 --> 24:10.214
No.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.185
I've known him many years.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.487
He's right more than he's wrong.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.489
And when he's wrong,
I often wonder if we...

24:18.491 --> 24:19.957
Misinterpreted what he said,
and he's too cautious

24:19.959 --> 24:22.493
To argue otherwise.

24:22.495 --> 24:25.529
Tomas' symbol was,
in fact, the dragon.

24:25.531 --> 24:28.499
Self-important but self-chosen.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.968
And the lion was the english,
of course.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.170
As I said,
tomas chose his own symbol.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.638
That's what
we bastard-born do,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.974
As technically
we belong to no one.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.044
Allowing me...

24:40.046 --> 24:42.480
To choose the lion
for myself.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.251
Is this the sword
you fought tomas with?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.586
A fight to the death.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.054
In a field of poppies.

24:54.526 --> 24:59.563

(diane gasps)

25:55.154 --> 25:57.655
Dear diane. Henry will
be back shortly

25:57.657 --> 26:00.157
With your glass
of port, your apples

26:00.159 --> 26:02.660
And salted biscuits.
It's such a lovely routine

26:02.662 --> 26:05.262
The way he insists
on taking care of you himself.

26:05.264 --> 26:09.066
What is it you want?
I didn't think
I wanted anything from you.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.135
I didn't think it was possible.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.571
As you have become
such a certainty.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.573
And here's another:
Henry strays

26:15.575 --> 26:17.775
From you to a young girl

26:17.777 --> 26:20.578
And then gets bored
and returns to you.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.212
I don't know how you do it.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.583
Because I love him for who
he is, not what he can give me.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.585
No, I meant I don't know
how you can put up with it.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.653
I put up with you,

26:29.655 --> 26:31.989
The public humiliation,
because at least, in private,

26:31.991 --> 26:34.325
I don't have him grinding
on top of me.

26:34.327 --> 26:37.695
Perhaps I'm saving us both
some discomfort.

26:39.764 --> 26:40.998
Get dressed.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.733
And go.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.301
I know about the legitimization.

26:44.303 --> 26:48.339
Don't bother trying
to deny it.

26:48.341 --> 26:51.342
I have ties with the vatican
who can confirm it,

26:51.344 --> 26:54.078
But... Do you know
how I learned?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.679
Kenna.

26:55.681 --> 26:58.682
She was mistaken for you.
In your younger years.

26:58.684 --> 27:01.685
She was very badly beaten
and she looked terrible.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.855
You won't look so good yourself
if word of this

27:04.857 --> 27:06.924
Leaks out.
You love your son, too.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.692
You would do anything for him.

27:08.694 --> 27:11.695
Yes. I would.

27:11.697 --> 27:14.865
But this I'm doing for myself.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.034
Because I'm anxious of late.

27:17.036 --> 27:20.204
You could say that my son's
wedding has me unnerved.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.874
Because you can't control
his future wife. A queen.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.944
I've given her
some counsel.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.647
I am eager
to see if she takes it.

27:30.715 --> 27:32.049
Look at us.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.417
We're talking like old friends.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.653
We've known each other
for a long time.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.288
This acquaintance is about
to be terminated.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.426
Disappear.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.728
Make up <i>any</i>

27:44.730 --> 27:46.764
Excuse, but do not come back.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.400
If you do, I'll tell henry
what you've done.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.735
He'd understand. He adores bash.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.370
(chuckles)

27:53.372 --> 27:57.675
He might have understood
if your timing had been better.

27:57.677 --> 28:02.446
Henry's fondness for anyone is
eclipsed by his love of power.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.982
He wants England,

28:04.984 --> 28:09.687
And he's getting it
when francis marries mary.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.056
Well...

28:12.058 --> 28:17.161
You could say, suddenly, francis
may be his favorite son.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.763
And you may be executed
for treason.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.365
Bash never
wanted this.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.701
If sebastian died
because of your words,

28:23.703 --> 28:25.302
Henry would never forgive you.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.204
He would find a way
to kill you.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.873
Which is why I'm letting you
leave his bed, our castle,

28:29.875 --> 28:31.308
With your life.

28:31.310 --> 28:35.212
But there is something

28:35.214 --> 28:37.214
I want to share with you first.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.749
Something
you can share

28:38.751 --> 28:41.452
With kenna.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.388
You want me to poison her.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.823
Why?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.158
There are two things
I can't abide,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.761
Betrayal and stupidity,

28:50.763 --> 28:52.730
And kenna's guilty of both.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.399
One can be tempered,
the other can never be remedied.

28:55.401 --> 28:59.069
Oh, she wants
what she wants,

28:59.071 --> 29:03.807
And she will go
and get it at any cost.

29:03.809 --> 29:07.511
Her desire for the king
may yet cost you your life.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.447
And there's one other person
who stands in her way.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.482
Who is that?

29:11.484 --> 29:13.350
Oh. Wait, I know.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.953
His wife. Me.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.455
And when she crosses me--
and she will--

29:18.457 --> 29:20.491
She will be dead anyway.

29:20.493 --> 29:23.093
All I'm asking

29:23.095 --> 29:26.096
Is that you take
this one thing off of my plate.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.333
Why must I always be the one
with blood on my hands?

29:29.335 --> 29:31.468
(sniffles)
mmm.

29:31.470 --> 29:35.806
Oh, it's sage. It's very nice.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.075
These are my terms.

29:46.017 --> 29:48.452
(sighs)

29:54.459 --> 29:56.493
(bell tolling)

29:56.495 --> 29:58.562
Good morning.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.065
(door opens)

30:02.067 --> 30:04.334
Morning.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.336
Hello.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.573
Aylee, would you pass me that,
please?

30:09.575 --> 30:11.542
Mmm.

30:11.544 --> 30:14.211
It smells nice.
What is it?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.513
It's a brew of lemon and honey.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.915
And a herb.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.550
It smells floral, to me.

30:19.552 --> 30:22.386
It's supposed to soothe
and heal.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.021
You can have it if you'd like.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.255
It's quite good.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.424
Uh, would you hold this?

30:27.426 --> 30:29.226
My family sent me these.

30:29.228 --> 30:33.197
As gifts to be worn on the day
mary would be wed.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.264
(scoffs)

30:34.266 --> 30:36.200
Oh...
You're so modest.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.102
Sometimes I forget your family
owns half of scotland.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.971
Only the lower half.

30:42.907 --> 30:45.542
They're yours to keep.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.879
Aylee, thank you.

30:48.881 --> 30:52.950
Do you think the wedding will
still happen though?

30:52.952 --> 30:54.585
I know mary talked to bash.

30:54.587 --> 30:57.554
Nostradamus' prediction
about tomas' death was true.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.523
I think that's open
to interpretation.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.426
(groans)
my head is pounding
with the stress.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.128
Of whether there'll be a wedding
or what you should wear?

31:05.130 --> 31:07.998
The only magic
I believe in is love.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.566
She should marry him.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.635
To the power of love.

31:14.138 --> 31:17.875
I want you to know...

31:17.877 --> 31:19.443
Whatever happens,
that I love you.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.512
(chuckles)
what's going to happen?

31:22.514 --> 31:25.048
We're getting married
tonight.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.220
I know you're scared.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.090
Talk to me.
If it's about England...
It's not politics.

31:34.525 --> 31:35.626
It's us.
We already have so much.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.228
To ask for more...

31:38.230 --> 31:41.131
Do you think we're testing fate?

31:44.035 --> 31:47.337
(girl wheezes, coughs)

31:47.339 --> 31:48.906
Testing fate how?

31:48.908 --> 31:51.041
By believing
we can have everything

31:51.043 --> 31:52.910
We ever wanted.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.945
Perhaps that privilege
is reserved for gods,

31:54.947 --> 31:56.380
Not queens and kings.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.682
Perhaps there is
a terrible price to pay.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.620
(wheezing)

32:05.924 --> 32:08.158
(coughing)

32:08.160 --> 32:11.028
(wheezing)

32:13.097 --> 32:17.334
We've devoted our lives
to our nations.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.671
We're still taking an enormous
risk for our countries,

32:20.673 --> 32:24.007
Whether we lay a claim
to England or...

32:24.009 --> 32:27.010
Defy my father and the vatican,

32:27.012 --> 32:28.946
For what we think is right

32:28.948 --> 32:31.415
For our people.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.251
I like that word, "we."

32:34.253 --> 32:35.686
And "our."

32:37.956 --> 32:40.991
(wheezing)

32:40.993 --> 32:43.360
(coughing)

32:43.362 --> 32:46.029
(wheezing)

32:47.665 --> 32:50.634
(coughs)

32:50.636 --> 32:53.637
(wheezing)

32:53.639 --> 32:54.638
(screams)

32:54.640 --> 32:57.107
(thudding)
(shattering)

32:57.109 --> 33:00.444
You've been alone in your
struggles your entire life.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.112
That's over now.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.115
I would die for you.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.587
Woman (screams):
Guards!

33:10.589 --> 33:12.089
Lola:
Your majesty,

33:12.091 --> 33:14.257
Come this way.

33:16.227 --> 33:17.594
They found her
like this.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.996
They came to us,
looking for you.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.065
Aylee.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.700
He said I'd never go home again.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.302
Aylee, no...

33:25.304 --> 33:28.572
Aylee:
Too much blood...

33:28.574 --> 33:30.474
Shed for you.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.311
(sniffles)

33:34.313 --> 33:37.047
You... We-we must...

33:39.617 --> 33:42.686
..Go home now.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.223
(sobbing)

33:52.463 --> 33:54.464
Aylee:
<i>Yes.</i>

33:54.466 --> 33:55.665
To the power of love.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.800
And friendship.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.109
(crying)

34:20.691 --> 34:22.492
But one among you will die.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.194
You are sent from hell.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.396
You are the devil!

34:26.398 --> 34:28.665
No.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.068
Oh, no. Please.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.136
(crying)

34:42.313 --> 34:44.681
Diane:
<i>The queen knows of my plan</i>
<i>to legitimize you.</i>

34:44.683 --> 34:47.317
Catherine has sworn
to keep our secret, in trade,

34:47.319 --> 34:48.452
But she can't be trusted.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.153
In trade for what?

34:50.155 --> 34:51.321
Nothing I can't live with.

35:03.201 --> 35:07.104
She can't control me or you
if she can't catch us.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.605
I will find henry again,

35:08.607 --> 35:10.240
Outside the castle walls.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.309
Even if she tells him
what I've done,

35:12.311 --> 35:13.410
I will make him understand.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.513
When he travels,
I will come to him.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.449
I will win him over.
I always do.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.285
Mary will be wed to francis,
England will be in his grip

35:22.287 --> 35:24.254
And none of this will matter.

35:24.256 --> 35:27.424
We will be back
in his good graces, protected.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.759
Forgive me if I don't choose
to run away with my mother

35:29.761 --> 35:32.129
And stay in the shadows
while you seduce my father

35:32.131 --> 35:33.430
Into giving a damn about us.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.265
Then go on your own.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.467
Just swear you will leave today.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.504
You are my son.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.243
Go.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.478
Save yourself.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.721
She was poisoned.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.726
Am I supposed to
suspect the queen?

36:02.728 --> 36:07.197
When I know the effects
of this poison.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.833
The blackening,

36:09.835 --> 36:12.435
The smell of violets.

36:12.437 --> 36:16.506
This is new poison.
Mine, not catherine's.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.411
Have you been watching me?

36:22.647 --> 36:27.450
Do you know
where I keep the key?

36:27.452 --> 36:31.288
One never knows
when you're close, do they?

36:33.591 --> 36:35.458
Why did you kill her?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.594
Mary had to believe
your prophecy.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.596
Or she would have wed francis.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.364
And the queen
would have killed her.

36:41.366 --> 36:44.601
You see mary as a victim.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.536
You think you have a bond

36:46.538 --> 36:49.372
Because you see yourself
as fate's victim, too.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.875
But she is a beautiful queen,

36:51.877 --> 36:55.579
And you...

36:55.581 --> 36:59.216
No! No! No!
...You are a monster.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.850
No! No!

37:00.852 --> 37:02.786
She is a victim!

37:02.788 --> 37:06.823
This girl is your victim!

37:06.825 --> 37:08.325
Look.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.793
Look at what you've done

37:09.795 --> 37:13.330
To a child of god!
You, who are nothing!

37:13.332 --> 37:14.497
You brought this on yourself.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.499
(screams)
no!

37:16.501 --> 37:18.501
(crying):
No! No! No.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.871
No. No. No...

37:21.873 --> 37:23.473
What about your duty
to scotland?

37:23.475 --> 37:24.975
What about
the alliance?

37:24.977 --> 37:26.376
I'll find a new one.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.478
This one has cost us
too much already.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.013
You have to tell francis why.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.514
I can't. The queen is right.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.450
He'll just... Talk me out of it.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.751
But maybe there's
some explanation...

37:34.753 --> 37:36.987
For nostradamus' gift?

37:36.989 --> 37:38.788
I believe in it.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.825
For aylee's death?

37:41.827 --> 37:45.629
Maybe. Whatever it is,
she's still dead.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.364
I can't risk it.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.700
I can't risk
losing anyone else I love.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.337
Come with me.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.007
We can't.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.510
She stands a better chance
of getting away

38:00.512 --> 38:01.945
On her own.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.847
And you're right.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.449
If francis knows,
he will stop you.

38:08.352 --> 38:09.719
(sniffles)

38:09.721 --> 38:12.022
I'll send for you when I can.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.923
We'll go home.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.425
To scotland.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.735
As queen of scotland,
I have made a decision.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.871
I lay no claim
to the english throne.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.806
There are too
many lives at stake,

38:29.808 --> 38:32.309
And I have a duty to those
who would die for me,

38:32.311 --> 38:34.644
Who believe that I
would die for them,

38:34.646 --> 38:36.880
Regardless
of my personal happiness.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.715
I know your terms.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.717
I know this will cost me
the man I love.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.053
Mary, no...
You're risking everything.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.055
Everything you've spent
your life waiting for.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.324
I know.
You're walking away
from England,

38:47.326 --> 38:49.793
From more power
than you could ever imagine.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.729
I'm walking away from France.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.731
Mary...

38:54.733 --> 38:55.799
You're frightened.

38:55.801 --> 38:58.401
Now is the time for courage!

38:58.403 --> 39:00.603
I don't understand.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.806
Please don't.
I've made up my mind.
Without telling me?

39:02.808 --> 39:05.642
I told you I was afraid.
I told you I wasn't sure

39:05.644 --> 39:07.477
If this was the right choice
for my country.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.878
What does that have to
do with marrying me?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.481
I told you,
I have no terms.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.350
I only want you.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.919
I can't trust that.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.521
I don't believe you.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.724
Your loyalty is to France.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.026
You have always told me so.
Have you not heard a
word that I've said?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.561
I love you.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.030
Love is irrelevant
to people like us,

39:27.032 --> 39:29.966
A privilege we do not share.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.369
You told me that.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.371
I remember it all.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.873
Every word,

39:36.875 --> 39:40.143
Every moment,
for the rest of my life...

39:40.145 --> 39:41.911
I love you.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.015
But I won't let
other people die for me.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.585
That is your fate.
As a ruler.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.886
Not if I can help it.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.522
You're not thinking clearly.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.425
You're upset, about aylee.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.861
You can't make decisions
now, but I can,

39:57.863 --> 39:59.796
And I'm never going
to let you go.

39:59.798 --> 40:03.400
All I ever wanted was you.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.735
Then we will
work this out.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.937
Wait for me while I talk
to my father before he goes

40:07.939 --> 40:11.074
Screaming to the vatican and
this... This gets out of hand.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.910
