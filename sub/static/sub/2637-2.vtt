WEBVTT

00:01.851 --> 00:04.046
Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.482
Does it have peanut oil?

00:05.655 --> 00:06.679
I'm not sure.

00:06.856 --> 00:10.792
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.157
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

00:14.698 --> 00:17.394
- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

00:17.567 --> 00:18.898
Here we go.

00:19.069 --> 00:22.197
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

00:22.372 --> 00:26.103
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

00:26.276 --> 00:28.471
...which then goes into their mouth.

00:28.645 --> 00:31.170
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

00:32.682 --> 00:33.979
I'll get it.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.812
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.277
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.514
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.123
You're not swelling, Howard.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.624
No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.560
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

00:49.399 --> 00:52.163
So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

00:52.335 --> 00:54.098
you know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...

00:54.270 --> 00:56.602
...people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

00:56.773 --> 01:01.767
So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

01:02.746 --> 01:05.271
yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

01:06.683 --> 01:07.707
yeah.

01:07.884 --> 01:09.784
I was wondering
if you could help me out-

01:09.953 --> 01:12.080
- Yes.
- Oh.

01:12.255 --> 01:14.587
Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

01:14.758 --> 01:17.090
...and I may not be here, so, oh-

01:18.061 --> 01:19.392
Hello.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.690
I'm sorry?

01:24.868 --> 01:28.201
Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

01:28.371 --> 01:30.965
- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.

01:31.541 --> 01:33.236
yeah, I probably won't.

01:34.310 --> 01:35.334
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.207
Hey, Raj.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.512
Still not talking to me, huh?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.742
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

01:42.919 --> 01:45.683
- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.346
Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

01:48.825 --> 01:51.487
- There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
- yeah.

01:51.661 --> 01:55.256
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

01:55.431 --> 01:57.729
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.

01:57.901 --> 01:59.528
Thank you.

02:00.904 --> 02:02.098
- Penny, wait.
- yeah?

02:03.473 --> 02:04.838
Um...

02:05.408 --> 02:07.069
If you don't have any other plans...

02:07.243 --> 02:10.406
...do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

02:10.580 --> 02:13.378
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

02:13.817 --> 02:16.684
you're kidding, right?

02:16.853 --> 02:19.549
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

02:19.722 --> 02:21.019
...and Superman catches her.

02:21.191 --> 02:23.625
- Which one was that?
- One.

02:24.194 --> 02:27.630
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

02:27.797 --> 02:29.526
yes, I know, men can't fly.

02:29.699 --> 02:31.189
No, let's assume that they can.

02:33.036 --> 02:34.264
Lois Lane is falling.

02:34.437 --> 02:36.905
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.133
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

02:40.310 --> 02:42.039
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

02:42.212 --> 02:44.646
...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

02:44.814 --> 02:47.749
...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

02:49.085 --> 02:52.452
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

02:52.622 --> 02:54.351
In what space, sir? In what space?

02:54.524 --> 02:55.923
She's 2 feet above the ground.

02:56.559 --> 02:59.119
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

02:59.295 --> 03:01.627
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't-

03:01.798 --> 03:05.564
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

03:05.735 --> 03:08.067
...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

03:08.238 --> 03:09.637
Are you listening to yourself?

03:09.806 --> 03:11.967
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

03:12.141 --> 03:14.405
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

03:14.577 --> 03:16.704
...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun-

03:16.880 --> 03:18.745
How does he fly at night?

03:18.915 --> 03:21.042
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

03:21.217 --> 03:24.243
...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

03:25.588 --> 03:27.317
I'm just gonna go wash up.

03:27.490 --> 03:29.355
I have 2600 comic books in there.

03:29.525 --> 03:33.086
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

03:33.263 --> 03:35.493
Challenge accepted.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.767
We're locked out.

03:39.936 --> 03:42.097
Also, the pretty girl left.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.463 --> 04:08.589
Okay.

04:08.765 --> 04:12.030
Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna-

04:12.201 --> 04:14.726
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

04:16.204 --> 04:19.935
- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.076
Why not?

04:22.245 --> 04:23.837
Well, we don't have a dolly...

04:24.013 --> 04:27.744
...or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.581
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

04:30.753 --> 04:33.085
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

04:33.256 --> 04:35.781
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.655
It's just a matter- I don't have this!
I do not have this!

04:39.595 --> 04:42.359
Archimedes would be so proud.

04:48.104 --> 04:49.867
Do you have any ideas?

04:50.039 --> 04:53.133
Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

04:54.644 --> 04:58.239
Easy. Easy.

05:00.783 --> 05:04.082
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

05:04.253 --> 05:07.711
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

05:07.890 --> 05:09.755
...call it 30 degrees, so about half.

05:09.926 --> 05:11.826
Exactly half.

05:13.029 --> 05:14.394
Exactly half.

05:15.698 --> 05:17.689
Let's push.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.059
Okay.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.296
See, it's moving. This is easy.

05:23.473 --> 05:24.906
It's all in the math.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.506
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

05:31.014 --> 05:32.982
Oh, okay.

05:34.650 --> 05:38.245
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.255
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

05:47.497 --> 05:49.397
You do understand
that our efforts here...

05:49.565 --> 05:54.025
...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

05:54.537 --> 05:57.097
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.332
yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.934
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

06:03.946 --> 06:07.279
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.047
Almost there.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.085
Almost there.

06:13.256 --> 06:14.917
- Almost there.
No, we're not.

06:15.091 --> 06:17.286
- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.

06:18.494 --> 06:19.859
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

06:20.029 --> 06:22.497
Oh, God, my fingers!

06:24.167 --> 06:26.226
- you okay?
- No, it hurt-

06:26.402 --> 06:29.633
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.673
So Penny is a little messy.

06:32.842 --> 06:34.503
A little messy?

06:34.677 --> 06:37.578
The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

06:37.747 --> 06:38.873
This is chaos.

06:39.048 --> 06:41.016
Excuse me.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.481
Explain to me a system...

06:42.652 --> 06:45.815
...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

06:45.988 --> 06:47.956
I'm just inferring that this as a couch...

06:48.124 --> 06:52.060
...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

06:52.929 --> 06:56.262
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

06:56.432 --> 06:58.900
...organize and label
the entire world around them?

06:59.769 --> 07:01.396
No.

07:02.371 --> 07:03.565
Well, they don't.

07:03.739 --> 07:05.206
Hard as it may be to believe...

07:05.374 --> 07:09.868
...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

07:10.413 --> 07:13.644
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.079
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.923
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

07:23.092 --> 07:24.992
Sheldon, this is not your home.

07:25.161 --> 07:28.722
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

07:30.633 --> 07:34.000
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

07:34.170 --> 07:35.364
Because it was immaculate.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.529
I mean, you open that man's closet...

07:37.707 --> 07:43.009
...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

07:43.579 --> 07:47.379
- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.347
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.612
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

07:51.787 --> 07:54.017
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

07:54.190 --> 07:55.350
- No.
- No?

07:55.525 --> 07:59.188
- No.
- No.

07:59.362 --> 08:01.330
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.

08:01.497 --> 08:03.556
Thank you again.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.233
Penny?

08:07.403 --> 08:10.270
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.071
I'm here for you.

08:14.710 --> 08:16.541
What's he talking about?

08:17.947 --> 08:19.278
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

08:19.448 --> 08:20.847
yeah, he didn't tell it right.

08:32.361 --> 08:34.056
Sheldon?

08:45.841 --> 08:47.604
Sheldon?

08:50.346 --> 08:51.973
Hello?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.264
- Sheldon?
- Shh!

09:17.240 --> 09:18.935
Penny's sleeping.

09:21.277 --> 09:22.471
Are you insane?

09:22.645 --> 09:26.240
You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

09:26.415 --> 09:27.439
I had no choice.

09:27.617 --> 09:31.109
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

09:31.287 --> 09:33.551
...and outside our living room
was that hallway...

09:33.723 --> 09:37.022
...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

09:38.294 --> 09:40.194
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

09:40.363 --> 09:43.196
...there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

09:43.599 --> 09:46.124
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

09:46.769 --> 09:49.067
No, no. you gave me an explanation.

09:49.238 --> 09:52.571
It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

09:53.209 --> 09:56.042
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

09:56.212 --> 09:58.077
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

10:01.417 --> 10:04.215
you might want to speak
in a lower register.

10:04.587 --> 10:06.054
What?

10:06.222 --> 10:09.680
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

10:09.859 --> 10:11.986
...so that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

10:12.161 --> 10:16.222
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.495
That's ridiculous!

10:21.904 --> 10:26.307
No, that's ridiculous.

10:28.744 --> 10:30.541
Fine.

10:31.814 --> 10:34.612
I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

10:34.784 --> 10:37.776
- I'm not leaving until I'm done.
- Oh, no.

10:41.324 --> 10:45.124
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.592
Oh, what the hell.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.507
Good morning.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.233
Morning.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.743
I have to say I slept splendidly.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.111
Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

11:08.284 --> 11:09.342
I'm not surprised.

11:09.518 --> 11:11.281
A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

11:11.454 --> 11:14.252
...is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.784
Sarcasm?

11:16.959 --> 11:18.119
you think?

11:18.861 --> 11:21.421
Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

11:21.597 --> 11:24.395
...but the end result
will be a measurable enhancement...

11:24.567 --> 11:26.296
...to Penny's quality of life.

11:26.469 --> 11:29.961
You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

11:30.139 --> 11:33.074
- you don't think that crosses a line?
- yes.

11:33.242 --> 11:34.709
For God's sake, Sheldon...

11:34.877 --> 11:38.643
...do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

11:38.814 --> 11:41.681
you have a sarcasm sign?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.977
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

11:46.555 --> 11:47.579
you want some cereal?

11:47.757 --> 11:51.215
I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.658
Hello, Honey Puffs.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.888
Son of a bitch!

11:56.832 --> 11:58.697
Penny's up.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.894
PENNy:
you sick, geeky bastards!

12:02.838 --> 12:04.863
How did she know it was us?

12:05.941 --> 12:08.466
I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

12:08.644 --> 12:10.339
...for her bedroom closet.

12:10.513 --> 12:11.537
PENNy:
Leonard?

12:11.714 --> 12:12.806
This is gonna be bad.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.110
Goodbye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.917
you came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

12:19.088 --> 12:20.248
yes, but only to clean.

12:20.423 --> 12:23.915
Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

12:24.093 --> 12:26.254
Give me back my key.

12:27.196 --> 12:28.220
I'm very, very sorry.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.661
Do you understand how creepy this is?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.858
yes, we discussed it at length last night.

12:33.035 --> 12:35.560
In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

12:35.738 --> 12:38.707
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

12:38.874 --> 12:42.469
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

12:45.147 --> 12:46.944
The throat doctor.

12:48.117 --> 12:51.553
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

12:52.288 --> 12:53.448
Depending on the depth...

12:53.622 --> 12:58.855
...that's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

13:05.568 --> 13:07.365
Oh.

13:08.137 --> 13:09.627
- God!
- Okay, look. No, Penny-

13:09.805 --> 13:12.672
I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...

13:12.842 --> 13:16.039
...when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

13:16.212 --> 13:17.770
...maybe we can talk about this.

13:17.947 --> 13:20.381
- Stay away from me.
- Sure. That's another way to go.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.574
Penny, Penny, hold on.

13:22.751 --> 13:24.116
Just to clarify...

13:24.286 --> 13:28.154
...because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

13:28.324 --> 13:32.283
Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...

13:32.461 --> 13:37.023
...or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?

13:43.305 --> 13:45.535
Well, that was a little non-responsive.

13:45.975 --> 13:49.240
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

13:54.049 --> 13:55.573
What's funny?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.719
That wasn't sarcasm?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.747
- No!
- Whoo.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.221
Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

14:06.395 --> 14:10.195
I have a Master's and two Ph. Ds,
I should not have to do this.

14:10.566 --> 14:11.999
What?

14:12.167 --> 14:14.465
I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

14:14.637 --> 14:16.468
I take full responsibility.

14:16.639 --> 14:19.233
I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

14:19.408 --> 14:25.506
...who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

14:37.393 --> 14:39.520
I did what I could.

14:43.699 --> 14:45.394
Hey, Raj.

14:50.105 --> 14:53.836
Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

14:54.009 --> 14:55.670
...but I'm really upset about it.

14:55.844 --> 14:59.007
I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

14:59.181 --> 15:01.979
Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.415
RAJESH
She's standing very close to me.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.012
Oh, my. She does smell good.

15:07.189 --> 15:09.521
What is that? Vanilla?

15:09.692 --> 15:10.716
you know?

15:10.893 --> 15:14.090
Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

15:14.263 --> 15:16.060
Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

15:16.231 --> 15:20.861
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.094
What was I saying?

15:23.272 --> 15:24.899
She's so chatty.

15:26.041 --> 15:29.670
Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.710
We'd have
the same cultural background...

15:31.880 --> 15:35.372
...and my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.

15:35.551 --> 15:36.984
It's obvious they meant well.

15:37.152 --> 15:39.211
I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said...

15:39.388 --> 15:41.720
...I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.

15:46.462 --> 15:49.863
I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

15:50.032 --> 15:53.024
...doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.533
Right?

15:54.703 --> 15:57.570
She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.974
That's exactly what I thought.

16:01.143 --> 16:03.475
Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

16:04.980 --> 16:08.006
Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.

16:21.263 --> 16:24.426
Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

16:26.635 --> 16:28.159
It's fine. you win.

16:29.938 --> 16:31.098
What's his problem?

16:31.607 --> 16:34.269
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

16:35.778 --> 16:37.803
Been there.

16:39.615 --> 16:40.775
Hello.

16:40.949 --> 16:44.385
Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

16:44.887 --> 16:45.945
Really? you?

16:46.121 --> 16:48.316
Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?

16:48.657 --> 16:51.524
Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

16:51.994 --> 16:54.019
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

16:54.196 --> 16:55.663
Well, she was upset at first...

16:55.831 --> 16:59.289
...but probably
because her sister shot somebody.

17:00.703 --> 17:04.537
Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

17:04.707 --> 17:08.006
She hugged you? How did she hug you?

17:15.884 --> 17:18.318
Is that her perfume I smell?

17:19.688 --> 17:21.656
Intoxicating, isn't it?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.802
- Hi.
- Oh.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.501
What's going on?

17:43.512 --> 17:44.740
Uh...

17:44.913 --> 17:46.881
Here's the thing:

17:50.919 --> 17:56.949
"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

17:57.126 --> 17:59.390
...so too I regret my participation
in what was...

17:59.561 --> 18:02.325
...at the very least, an error in judgment.

18:03.365 --> 18:05.526
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

18:05.701 --> 18:07.965
...is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

18:08.137 --> 18:11.868
Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

18:12.040 --> 18:16.340
...even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.674
Another example,
from the field of Ebola research-"

18:20.849 --> 18:22.373
Leonard.

18:22.551 --> 18:24.143
yeah?

18:26.488 --> 18:28.251
We're okay.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.041
Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.476
- One package Philips head screws?
- Check.

18:52.648 --> 18:54.616
Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

18:54.783 --> 18:56.978
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

18:57.152 --> 18:59.712
I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.721
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering-

19:02.891 --> 19:03.983
Considering what?

19:04.159 --> 19:06.992
How great this place looks?

19:07.362 --> 19:09.762
- Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
- What?

19:09.932 --> 19:12.457
These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

19:12.634 --> 19:15.432
...of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

19:15.604 --> 19:18.437
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

19:19.808 --> 19:22.868
- It looked pretty good in the store.
- It is an inefficient design.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.637
For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

19:24.813 --> 19:26.838
...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

19:27.015 --> 19:29.643
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

19:29.818 --> 19:34.084
Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.190
- Good point. How will you cool it?
- Guys, I got this.

19:37.359 --> 19:39.520
- Hang on, Penny.
- How about fans?

19:39.695 --> 19:43.096
- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.790
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

19:45.968 --> 19:47.458
Run some quarter-inch PVC-

19:47.636 --> 19:49.467
Guys, this is actually really simple.

19:50.205 --> 19:51.797
Hold on, honey, men at work.

19:54.209 --> 19:57.645
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

19:57.813 --> 20:01.271
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

20:01.450 --> 20:04.385
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

20:04.553 --> 20:08.216
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.656
Oh, I've got it.

20:15.697 --> 20:20.430
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

20:20.602 --> 20:22.763
- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.

20:22.938 --> 20:26.499
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

20:26.675 --> 20:29.473
- Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.408
- Done.
- Got it.

20:34.283 --> 20:36.581
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
