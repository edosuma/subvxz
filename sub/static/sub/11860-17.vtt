00:10.166 --> 00:13.083
(children)
'Daddy!'

00:13.166 --> 00:15.709
(children)
'Daddy, please come.'

00:20.834 --> 00:22.709
God! Oh, God!

00:30.375 --> 00:31.500
No.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.583
How did a father not go back
inside and get his own boys
out?

01:18.667 --> 01:19.625
I don't know.

01:19.709 --> 01:21.000
A man would die to save his own.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.417
Lil, it's Nick.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.125
Uh..

01:43.208 --> 01:45.667
I broke down on. I'm, uh..

01:45.750 --> 01:48.875
...on Conshohocken near Belmont.

01:48.959 --> 01:50.959
Pretty messed up.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.500
Lil, I think
I may have killed somebody.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.208
Oh, crap.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.583
Department vehicle
signed out by Detective
Vera.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.834
- Gone before I got here.
- Stop writing, will you?

02:14.917 --> 02:16.375
Sorry, Detective. Got to fill
out an accident report on
all..

02:16.458 --> 02:19.417
I said, stop...writing.

02:22.792 --> 02:23.875
Look, uh..

02:23.959 --> 02:25.417
Look, do me
a favor, can you, uh..

02:25.500 --> 02:28.083
...just make it a car stop?

02:28.166 --> 02:29.917
No accident?

02:32.250 --> 02:33.959
Right. Sure.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.208
Okay, go ahead.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.166
I got it from here.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.125
Thanks.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.625
Scotty...it's me.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.458
We got a problem.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.709
[sighing]
Damn, Nick.

03:24.792 --> 03:27.750
[phone beeps off]
Is there any
blood?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.166
A little on the airbag.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.667
Yeah, it looks like
he just hit the sign.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.417
[sighing]
No animals down on the
road.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.000
You hear anything on the radio?

03:35.083 --> 03:36.041
Not yet.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.375
What about that uniform?

03:37.458 --> 03:39.000
Nick was gone when
he arrived on the scene

03:39.083 --> 03:40.583
and I told him it's on me.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.000
But why ditch the car?

03:44.083 --> 03:46.291
Trying to duck a DUI?

03:46.375 --> 03:49.250
Message he left was
a whole lot worse than that.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.625
You think he was serious?

03:50.709 --> 03:52.291
I called him back five times

03:52.375 --> 03:54.125
and he won't answer his cell.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.875
I'll get it towed to my guy

03:57.959 --> 04:01.125
have him...clean it up.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.041
What the boss don't know
can't hurt him, you know?

04:04.125 --> 04:05.709
He's got enough problems.

04:05.792 --> 04:06.917
Well, at least till
we figure out

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
what the hell's going on.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.166
- Will or Kat know?
- No.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.583
Figured it's
bad enough I got you

04:12.667 --> 04:15.375
on the hook for this now, too.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.542
It's Nick, Lil.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.625
I mean, they'd want to know.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.458
I'll have them
swing by his place.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.667
(Lilly)
'See if he turns up.'

04:28.709 --> 04:30.458
The guy's a mess.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.500
[glass breaking]
Yeah, he's been for a while
now.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.458
Schmitty's is up the road.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.875
He's probably
headed home from the bar.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.375
Big guy with a voice, right?

04:40.458 --> 04:41.583
He in some kind of trouble?

04:41.667 --> 04:42.875
What kind of
condition was he
in?

04:42.959 --> 04:44.125
Whoa, just so you know

04:44.208 --> 04:45.709
I didn't serve him
more than three.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.917
Guy tops it off in
the parking lot, that's on
him.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.208
Not trying to jam you up.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.542
Just tell us when he left.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.375
About an hour ago,
wits about him.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.125
I'll cut off anybody,
cop or no cop.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.375
Yeah. Yeah, we got that.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.083
Sounds like
he's become a
regular.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.709
Every night this week,
knocking back the Manhattans.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.667
He get into it
with anyone at the bar?

05:01.750 --> 05:04.041
Not tonight. Keeps to himself,
regulars know he's a cop.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.667
Wait. What do you mean,
not tonight?

05:05.750 --> 05:07.875
Last week, some idiot came
in here shooting his mouth
off.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.333
Me and Big Mac tossed him
before it got out of hand.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.542
And this idiot got a name?

05:11.625 --> 05:12.625
(Lilly)
What'd he look
like?

05:12.709 --> 05:14.792
I don't know. Just some guy.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.291
White, medium build,
maybe thirties.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.917
So what was it about?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.583
Not sure, the guy was sure

05:19.667 --> 05:21.291
busted up about something.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.500
(male #1)
'You happy with
yourself, detective?'

05:22.583 --> 05:23.834
I thought
you should know.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it, buddy, okay?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.291
I tried to tell you
but you wouldn't listen!

05:27.375 --> 05:29.875
My brother's gone,
and that's on you now.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.542
Know what, jackass?
I told you to hit the
bricks.

05:31.625 --> 05:32.625
You're nothing but a drunk bum.

05:32.709 --> 05:33.709
Mac, get him out of here.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.250
How can you live with yourself?

05:35.333 --> 05:36.375
You need to calm down.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.000
- Come on!
- Just relax, man.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.792
Just calm down. Just relax.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.333
I'm alright.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.041
I don't know
what the guy's beef was.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.458
Something about his brother.

05:49.542 --> 05:52.709
He blamed Vera,
felt he wronged him somehow?

05:52.792 --> 05:54.917
(Bartender)
'Cop never bothered nobody,
so I gave the guy the boot.'

05:55.000 --> 05:56.917
- Nick ever here with anybody?
- Nah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.875
Mostly just drinks alone.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.417
Last couple nights
in here looking over

06:00.500 --> 06:02.125
'some old file photos.'

06:02.208 --> 06:04.625
Photos? What, like,
crime scene photos?

06:04.709 --> 06:05.834
I don't know.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.125
They were dark,
hard to make out.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.166
Like something burnt up.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.583
(bartender)
'Honestly, his line of
work.'

06:11.667 --> 06:13.875
I didn't want to ask.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.625
Key still works.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.959
Whoa.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.959
(Kat)
'Clearly the maid don't.'

06:19.041 --> 06:20.959
(Will)
'God, just when
you think you know a guy.'

06:21.041 --> 06:22.834
Oscar needs a Felix.

06:24.208 --> 06:25.500
(Will)
'Oh.'

06:25.583 --> 06:27.750
Told me he
passed his
physical.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.125
Dude's a time bomb.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.667
(Will)
'It's worse than I thought.'

06:35.750 --> 06:37.875
- What was her name again?
- Julie.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.625
Split up years ago.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.333
Booze and pills
definitely do not mix

06:41.417 --> 06:43.500
with photos of the ex.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.959
- What do you got?
- 'It's a crime scene
photo.'

06:49.041 --> 06:51.875
Something I saw Nick
looking at a few weeks back.

06:56.458 --> 07:00.458
[knocking on desk]
Hmm? What the hell?

07:00.542 --> 07:02.458
Can't you see
I'm taking a table
nap?

07:02.542 --> 07:03.750
(Kat)
Been a lot of those lately.

07:03.834 --> 07:06.375
What do you got?

07:06.458 --> 07:07.875
Some other case.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.375
Arson photo.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.959
Didn't recognize
it at the time.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.500
"J.D. Billingsley, 11/06."

07:17.583 --> 07:19.500
But why bring home
a four-year-old arson case?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.333
Might have something to
do with the guy at the
bar.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.500
- 'You remember this case?'
- No.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.750
But the fire marshal would.

07:26.834 --> 07:30.834
Billingsley.
Oh, yeah, I remember.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.458
Double homicide,
arson, couple years back.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.709
You worked that
with Nick,
right?

07:34.792 --> 07:36.667
Yeah, that's right.
What's going on?

07:36.750 --> 07:37.834
He contact you?

07:37.917 --> 07:39.583
Any reason
the case might come up?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.125
No. Any reason it should?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.208
Tell us
about the arson case,
Ray.

07:43.291 --> 07:46.208
Was a house over in Kensington.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.041
Incendiary,
pretty open and shut.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.208
J.D. Billingsley?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.041
Joe Don Billingsley.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.500
Lit up his own place,
middle of the night.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.917
It was a double homicide?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
His own two boys.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.834
Drunk bastard had
custody for the weekend.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.959
Looks like
a bomb went
off.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.375
Flashover.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.792
Simultaneous ignition
of all combustible material.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.041
Flashover.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.166
Smoke and gas layer

08:14.250 --> 08:15.959
got trapped at the ceiling.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.834
At 1,100 degrees, the
whole room burst into flames.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.875
Father said he was
asleep on the
couch.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.208
Yeah, he
also said he couldn't get

08:25.291 --> 08:26.917
to the kids' room down the hall.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.583
Yeah, ran
into a wall of
flame.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.625
With no burns on his bare feet?

08:31.709 --> 08:33.083
Thought he
ran out the front
door.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.417
Yeah, just let in more
oxygen, fed the beast.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.166
Did you see the
crazed glass back
there?

08:38.250 --> 08:39.834
Puddle configurations?

08:39.917 --> 08:41.417
Multiple points of origin.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.709
Burn marks on the
baseboards and
walls.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.083
Yeah, all
the way down the hall.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.583
Seen hundreds of these.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.375
(Ray)
'Most of them do it
for the insurance.'

08:49.458 --> 08:52.709
- No. This place was a
rental.
- 'Whatever.'

08:52.792 --> 08:54.333
Fire this
hot don't occur without

08:54.417 --> 08:57.083
the use of an accelerant.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.709
What, lighter fluid?

08:58.792 --> 09:01.709
Butane, propane,
maybe gasoline.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.375
Same result.

09:03.458 --> 09:07.125
(Ray)
'Got your pour patterns
on the floor right there.'

09:09.458 --> 09:10.875
Under the beds.

09:12.166 --> 09:15.166
Son of a bitch
burned his own kids
up.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.458
Then ran out of the house.

09:19.166 --> 09:22.125
Three and five, those boys.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.917
That one just about
tore everybody up.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.291
Including Nick?

09:25.375 --> 09:27.417
Nick was going
through a divorce at the time.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.917
Rubbed him pretty raw.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.542
Sick bastard killed
his kids just to spite his ex.

09:32.625 --> 09:33.667
Nick put him away?

09:33.750 --> 09:34.959
Billingsley got life.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.834
He's lucky he
didn't get the needle.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.250
He didn't have the
decency to take his own life.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.041
Any reason Nick would
be looking into that case
again?

09:42.125 --> 09:43.709
Never said nothing to me.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.000
(Scotty)
You remember
if this Joe Don had a
brother?

09:46.083 --> 09:47.208
Maybe at the trial?

09:47.291 --> 09:48.500
I'm sorry, I don't.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.083
Is everything okay?

09:50.166 --> 09:51.709
(Lilly)
'Well, you hear from him, Ray'

09:51.792 --> 09:53.291
let us know.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.542
(Kat)
Joe Don Billingsley,
convicted in '08.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.834
Arson, double homicide.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.375
Doing life up in Rockford.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.041
Was. Till he caught a
shiv last week in the
yard.

10:07.125 --> 10:09.333
Bled out.
Old Joe Don's gone.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.709
Could be the guy
Nick meant, got
killed?

10:11.792 --> 10:13.208
A loudmouth
at the bar blamed Nick

10:13.291 --> 10:14.375
for his brother's death.

10:14.458 --> 10:15.750
(Will)
'Younger brother, Travis.'

10:15.834 --> 10:18.166
Popped twice for
DUI, resisting arrest.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.041
Well, now he's stalking Nick.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.166
He was fired
from his last job at Costco.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.291
We're trying to track
down a new work address.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.834
(Scotty)
Travis.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.709
Looks dumb enough
to go after a cop.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.834
Morning, Lieutenant.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.709
Something wrong
with the air upstairs, Pat?

10:44.792 --> 10:47.709
You know where
Detective Vera is, John?

10:49.458 --> 10:50.542
I guess I'm about to find out.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.375
Don't jerk me around.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.417
I know all about
the abandoned department vehicle

10:54.500 --> 10:55.959
(Pat)
'out on Conshohocken Road.'

10:56.041 --> 10:56.875
Okay.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.291
I also know that one of your

10:58.375 --> 11:00.500
detectives had it
towed to a private garage.

11:00.583 --> 11:01.709
One of my detectives?

11:01.792 --> 11:03.208
(Pat)
'Can't say I blame them.'

11:03.291 --> 11:05.375
Damaged vehicle,
reeking of Kentucky sour mash.

11:05.458 --> 11:06.458
Alright, get to it, Pat.

11:06.542 --> 11:07.667
That's a $35,000 vehicle

11:07.750 --> 11:09.166
that belongs to the department.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.709
(Pat)
'And I would like
to get it back'

11:10.792 --> 11:13.250
before the
commissioner gets wind of
this.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.709
Good as new.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.250
I'll get right on it.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.166
As for Detective Vera,
I would suggest

11:20.250 --> 11:21.417
you find out where he is

11:21.500 --> 11:23.208
and just what
the hell is going on

11:23.291 --> 11:24.750
before the end
of the working day.

11:24.834 --> 11:27.083
Oh, I'll get
to the bottom of
it.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.041
Put your house in order, John

11:34.125 --> 11:36.375
or I'll do it for you.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.333
(Scotty)
Travis Billingsley.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.834
Detective Valens and Rush.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.166
That supposed
to impress me?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.583
Supposed to jog your memory.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.291
Last time you saw
Detective Nick Vera.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.625
Why? Something happened to him?

11:53.709 --> 11:54.709
Asked you a question, pal.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.125
How you know Detective Vera?

11:56.208 --> 11:57.917
Oh, so now
I'm supposed to help the
police?

11:59.875 --> 12:02.041
How's that
for an impression, jackass?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.625
In case
you need my badge number.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.333
(Lilly)
This ain't a
courtesy call,
Travis.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.625
You got into a bar fight
with Detective Vera last week.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.125
That wasn't a fight.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.625
Just tracked him down
to let him know what he
did.

12:11.709 --> 12:12.667
Yeah, what'd he do?

12:12.750 --> 12:13.750
He put my brother away.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.041
Got him killed.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.625
Yeah, real sorry
they don't look kindly

12:16.709 --> 12:18.542
on scumbags who burn up
their own kids in prison.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.041
My brother wasn't a monster.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.375
Joe Don didn't do it.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.959
Right, buddy.
Nobody in jail did it, right?

12:24.041 --> 12:25.291
I had proof.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.709
I tried for months
to get Detective
Vera

12:26.792 --> 12:28.166
to take another
look at the case

12:28.250 --> 12:29.458
but he wouldn't listen.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.792
Detective, Detective Vera,
can I talk to you?

12:34.875 --> 12:36.083
It's about my brother.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.458
What's the name, buddy?

12:37.542 --> 12:40.542
- Travis Billingsley.
- Billingsley?

12:40.625 --> 12:42.917
(Travis)
'Called five times
about my brother, Joe Don.'

12:43.000 --> 12:45.834
He's doing
life up in Rockford for arson.

12:45.917 --> 12:46.917
Yeah, 'course. I remember.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.083
I just need you to hear me out

12:48.166 --> 12:49.583
'cause the DA won't and that

12:49.667 --> 12:51.166
court-appointed lawyer my
brother had was a joke--

12:51.250 --> 12:52.709
Well, it's a little late, pal.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.250
- He confessed.
- That's not true.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.166
Yeah. Check
the trial
transcripts.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.208
He admitted he did it when he

12:58.291 --> 13:00.417
was in lockup awaiting trial.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.083
- Game over.
- 'That's just it, he
didn't.'

13:02.166 --> 13:04.458
Check out the record
on that cellblock snitch.

13:04.542 --> 13:07.291
Inmate the DA put
on the stand was a liar.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.125
My brother would never
admit to setting that fire

13:09.208 --> 13:10.917
'cause he didn't do it.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.333
Everybody's
innocent
in the can.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.583
But he never confessed
to you, did he, detective?

13:18.667 --> 13:21.125
Just asking you to take a look.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.542
Yeah, sure.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.792
I'll take a look.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.917
He didn't give a rat's ass.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.917
That cellblock snitch has
given false testimony
before.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.208
Cody Blanchard lied when he
said my brother confessed.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.458
How do you know?

13:37.542 --> 13:38.875
'Cause he done it
three times
before.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.166
That's how come
they kept letting him
out.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.041
So, he's a serial snitch.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.250
That don't mean he lied.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.208
Another guy
he did it to got
freed

13:45.291 --> 13:47.000
after he
recanted his
testimony.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.500
That the only reason
you tracked Nick down?

13:49.583 --> 13:50.875
Let him know that?

13:50.959 --> 13:52.250
Wouldn't you?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.500
Lying SOB snitch
sealed my brother's
fate

13:56.583 --> 13:57.917
and got rewarded for it.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.375
And now it's too late.

14:04.792 --> 14:05.750
(Kat)
'Called Frackville.'

14:05.834 --> 14:07.291
Found out Nick went to visit

14:07.375 --> 14:09.792
Billingsley's old cellblock
snitch a few days ago.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.583
Already landed back
in the can?

14:11.667 --> 14:12.750
Thieving drug fiend.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.834
Old habits die hard.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.875
(John)
'Anybody here seen Nick?'

14:19.625 --> 14:21.125
Not yet, boss.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.750
Don't know.
He's got plenty of
time.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.166
Maybe he
took a sick
day.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.750
So that's how we're
gonna play this,
huh?

14:26.834 --> 14:28.542
- What's that, boss?
- 'Oh, cut the BS.'

14:28.625 --> 14:30.333
I know that Nick is
missing, along with his car.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.583
(John)
'This whole mess has
already blown upstairs.'

14:32.667 --> 14:34.333
'As much
you want to protect Nick'

14:34.417 --> 14:36.917
all of you might want to start
thinking about your own badges.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.250
Look, we
got no idea where Nick went

14:40.333 --> 14:41.583
(Kat)
'but we're on it.'

14:41.667 --> 14:43.625
[muttering]
Alright, look.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.333
Think it's got
something to do with a guy

14:45.417 --> 14:48.375
Nick put away on an arson case
four years ago.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.625
Got killed
in prison last week.

14:49.709 --> 14:50.834
(John)
'Billingsley.'

14:50.917 --> 14:51.959
What does
this got to do
with

14:52.041 --> 14:53.500
Nick cracking up his car?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.125
Don't know, but it's
the last case he was working
on.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.583
That's it?

14:58.291 --> 15:01.125
(John)
Is there anything else I
need to get in front of
here?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.417
Nick's in bad shape, boss.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.125
Something I don't know, Kat.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.917
It's not physical, John.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.542
His head's not right.
We're worried about him.

15:15.458 --> 15:16.792
Alright, talk to ADA Bell.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.583
See what he knows about
the Billingsley case.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.917
Rush and Valens
went to pay Billingsley's

15:20.000 --> 15:21.125
old cellmate a visit.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.250
(Will)
They're trying to track down

15:22.333 --> 15:24.041
his ex, see if he talked to her.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.583
I'll reach out
to Boyle over in
Feds.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.583
See if we can get
a location on his cell
phone.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.834
- We'll find him, boss.
- We'd better..

15:29.917 --> 15:32.000
Before he does
any more harm.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.083
Especially to himself.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.750
(Will)
'Hey, Julie.'

15:38.834 --> 15:40.250
What's going on?

15:40.333 --> 15:41.625
Is this about Nick?

15:41.709 --> 15:43.583
Have you seen him?

15:43.667 --> 15:45.000
He stopped by this morning.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.750
He didn't look
so good. Is he okay?

15:46.834 --> 15:48.083
Just showed up at your door?

15:48.166 --> 15:49.375
Really kind of threw me.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.500
I-I hadn't seen him
since the divorce

15:51.583 --> 15:53.875
and we never really
talked after that.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.625
- What'd he want?
- I don't know.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.875
But it looked like he
had something on his mind.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.542
I was trying
to get my kids ready.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.959
Hey, Jules.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.166
Nick.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.458
Uh..

16:09.542 --> 16:11.375
Thanks. If only
I had time to read it.

16:11.458 --> 16:14.417
What are you doing here?

16:14.500 --> 16:17.875
I don't know. Uh..

16:17.959 --> 16:20.709
Just felt like I
needed to see
you.

16:20.792 --> 16:21.959
How've you been doing?

16:22.041 --> 16:24.417
You really should
have called. I..

16:26.583 --> 16:27.709
Is something wrong?

16:27.792 --> 16:29.750
No. Uh, sorry.

16:29.834 --> 16:30.917
You're right.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.959
I was just
getting my son ready for
school.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.208
Your son?

16:37.709 --> 16:39.875
I know you got remarried. I..

16:39.959 --> 16:42.375
Clint. He just
started preschool.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.500
Clint. Wow.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.083
[toddler
crying]
I like that.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.417
I also have
a two-year-old daughter.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.291
That would be
what you hear yelling
upstairs.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.250
Mommy, I
can't find my other shoe.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.917
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.500
And we
can talk for a minute.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.917
(Julie)
'Okay, now you go
find the other one'

17:01.000 --> 17:02.333
'and I'll
find your jacket'

17:02.417 --> 17:03.583
and tell your sister
I'll be right there.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.125
(Clint)
'Okay, mommy.'

17:11.625 --> 17:13.417
Never really
had a chance to talk.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.625
Figured it
must be important, but..

17:15.709 --> 17:17.166
Didn't say
where he was headed?

17:17.250 --> 17:19.542
Never got that far.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.417
It looked like
he'd been up all night

17:21.500 --> 17:23.250
like he was working a case.

17:25.208 --> 17:26.542
Is he okay?

17:26.625 --> 17:28.667
We don't know,
but if you hear from him
again

17:28.750 --> 17:30.291
make sure to give us a call.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.291
What up, Squirrel?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.917
Figure you got to
watch your back in
here

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
with a
nickname like
that.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.000
Yeah, yeah. Everybody's got

17:41.083 --> 17:42.291
to watch their back in here.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.834
Just better at it than most.

17:43.917 --> 17:46.208
Well, it helps to have
friends in the DA's office.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.625
(Lilly)
'Got the parole board to cut'

17:47.709 --> 17:49.792
you loose early
three different
times.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.083
Yeah. I'm just keeping
my eyes and my ears open.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.792
Waiting for a nut
to fall from a tree.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.792
Unfortunately,
that
nasty meth habit

17:55.875 --> 17:57.125
keeps landing
you back in
here.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.625
Yeah, well, that's a..

17:58.709 --> 18:01.125
That's just
a temporary situation.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.625
Now what can I do for you?

18:03.709 --> 18:07.500
Why did Detective Vera
recently come to see
you?

18:07.583 --> 18:10.250
Philly Homicide, ain't you?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.083
You guys don't talk?

18:12.166 --> 18:13.500
Was it about
the Billingsley case?

18:13.583 --> 18:16.583
Billingsley.
Man, that's ancient history.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.000
Yeah. So was Joe Don.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.709
Caught a shiv
up in Rockford last
week.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.542
Yeah, I heard about
that from your partner.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.917
Hard row to hoe for a baby
killer inside these walls.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.583
So, what did Detective Vera
want to know about Joe Don?

18:26.667 --> 18:29.000
Oh, man, I mean,
what is it with this case?

18:29.083 --> 18:30.166
I already testified to the DA.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.917
Ain't the
question we asked
you.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.917
Aah!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.667
Te-tell me again
what's in it for me.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.333
(Lilly)
'Oh, we don't tell
the last homicidal'

18:39.417 --> 18:42.834
maniac you flipped on
it was you who gave him
up.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.333
What kind of cops are you?

18:44.417 --> 18:46.583
The kind that don't care
about you. Detective
Vera!

18:46.667 --> 18:48.959
- Why'd he come talk to you?
- No disrespect, Detective.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.500
It don't have
to be like this, okay?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.166
I tried to play
ball with your guy

18:52.250 --> 18:54.375
but he just
took it the wrong way.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.709
You testified that Joe
Don told you he did it.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.291
- Burned his house down.
- That's right.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.709
That what I told the DA,
detective, on the record.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.667
While he was
awaiting
trial in county
lockup.

19:03.750 --> 19:04.709
Damn right.

19:04.792 --> 19:05.792
He said that if he couldn't

19:05.875 --> 19:07.041
have custody of them kids

19:07.125 --> 19:08.542
then that bitch
couldn't, either.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.792
And that's why
he set that house on fire.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.208
Joe Don said this
to you even though

19:12.291 --> 19:13.917
he never confessed
to me or anybody
else?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.125
We were on the same
cellblock, detective.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.208
Yeah, but he
didn't have a
cellmate.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.208
When exactly did he
tell you he did it?

19:21.291 --> 19:23.250
When I was
walking by his cell.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.375
What, through the food slot?

19:24.458 --> 19:25.834
Yeah, that's right.

19:25.917 --> 19:29.083
He said he lit
that bitch up with gasoline.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.083
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.417
He said because he wanted
custody of those kids,
right?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.750
- That's what he said.
- Both of them?

19:35.834 --> 19:36.917
The boy and the girl?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.041
Yeah, that's
right, both of them.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.750
A little girl, too.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.083
Hmm.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.709
Joe Don
didn't have a little girl.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.417
He just had two boys.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.417
Look, man!

19:49.500 --> 19:50.792
I just told that DA, detective

19:50.875 --> 19:52.083
what he wanted to hear

19:52.166 --> 19:54.083
just like I'm telling you.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.625
What's that?

19:55.709 --> 19:58.125
(Cody)
What do you want me
to say? He did it?

19:58.208 --> 19:59.166
Then he did it.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.417
Whatever you want me to say.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.583
You just give
me the right information

20:01.667 --> 20:02.875
before I take the stand

20:02.959 --> 20:05.709
and I'll say
it right, don't you worry.

20:05.792 --> 20:08.709
A man is dead
because of your lying
ass.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.917
Because of me?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.208
I thought it was you
who put him in here.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.291
(Cody)
'Hey! Hey!'

20:16.375 --> 20:18.417
I don't get it.
I played the game.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.125
I fed you and the DA
what you need and-and-and

20:21.208 --> 20:22.291
this, this is the thanks I get?

20:22.375 --> 20:23.542
Yeah, the thanks.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.625
Well, that cop
had a screw loose, no?

20:24.709 --> 20:26.166
The truth is, Joe Don didn't say

20:26.250 --> 20:28.834
any of that BS to you
about offing his kids,
right?

20:30.083 --> 20:31.750
Difference does it make?

20:31.834 --> 20:33.083
(Cody)
'I mean, if he didn't do
that'

20:33.166 --> 20:35.208
then he
did something else, right?

20:36.208 --> 20:37.542
I mean, we all did it in here.

20:37.625 --> 20:38.875
(Lilly)
The difference
is

20:38.959 --> 20:40.291
he's dead, Squirrel.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.166
Yeah, well,
I wasn't glad to hear

20:42.250 --> 20:46.083
that Joe Don got stuck, but,
uh, huh, that man was twisted.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.750
Oh, yeah.
And he was in denial, too.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.208
What are you talking about?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.834
Oh, he would cry
himself to sleep every night.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.709
Just crying about them kids.

20:54.792 --> 20:55.917
Yeah, then he would write

20:56.000 --> 20:59.333
letters to
some crackpot scientist.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.333
What scientist?
How do you know?

21:01.417 --> 21:03.041
A little C.O. bird told me.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.375
He's working on his appeal.

21:04.458 --> 21:07.208
You know, thought
he could get him out.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.667
What's a name worth to you?

21:08.750 --> 21:12.709
Worth keeping your acorns
out of a vice, Squirrel.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.583
This is Joe Don
Billingsley's old house.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.750
FBI tracks Nick's
phone to this
location.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.083
Yeah. Why
would he come back here?

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000
Who you calling?

21:26.083 --> 21:27.542
Nick.

21:43.458 --> 21:44.750
It's his.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.125
Last call an hour ago to me.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.500
Home phone.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.583
Why wouldn't he
just call your cell?

21:53.667 --> 21:56.625
(Will)
'I don't know.'

21:56.709 --> 21:59.041
(female #1)
'You have one unheard message.'

21:59.125 --> 22:00.542
[phone beeping]
Left a voicemail.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.709
(Nick over voicemail)
'Hey, man, uh, it's Nick.'

22:02.792 --> 22:05.875
'I just wanted
to tell you, uh, it's been'

22:05.959 --> 22:07.542
'great working with you.'

22:07.625 --> 22:10.125
(Nick)
'You've always been
a-a...a good friend to me.'

22:11.667 --> 22:13.208
'I think
I still owe you 50 bucks.'

22:13.291 --> 22:16.542
'Anyways, um...that's about it.'

22:17.500 --> 22:19.083
'Sorry about the whole mess.'

22:26.291 --> 22:27.959
(Scotty)
Hey, boss.

22:28.041 --> 22:31.583
Next time you two get the
instinct to protect me,
don't.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.083
Where are we on Nick?

22:34.166 --> 22:36.458
(Scotty)
'Running down
a list of calls, messages'

22:36.542 --> 22:38.417
anyone who talked to Nick
in the past 24.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.125
(Lilly)
'Yeah, there was a
recent call on his cell'

22:40.208 --> 22:43.375
to Jeannette Peterson,
Billingsley's ex-wife.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.041
(Scotty)
'Miller and
Jeffries are headed over'

22:45.125 --> 22:46.041
to talk to her now.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.250
Also, calls to a Goran Petrovic

22:48.333 --> 22:49.458
a professor over at Temple.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.208
One yesterday
and one last week.

22:51.291 --> 22:53.333
(Scotty)
Correspondence
records at Rockford

22:53.417 --> 22:55.250
show Billingsley
wrote multiple letters

22:55.333 --> 22:56.792
(Scotty)
'to the same Dr. Petrovic.'

22:56.875 --> 22:59.000
- What kind of professor?
- Chemical engineering.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.625
Also worked for multiple

23:00.709 --> 23:03.792
companies that served
private military suppliers.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.291
Hit the campus.
Pay the doc a
visit.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.625
You talk
to Criminal
Intelligence?

23:06.709 --> 23:08.083
Oh, yeah, we got teams

23:08.166 --> 23:09.834
of plainclothes cops
trying to track him down.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.792
Alright, tell
them no paper
trail.

23:11.875 --> 23:14.083
(Lilly)
I just said find him, bring
him in, no questions asked.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, don't take "no"
for an answer from
Nick.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.250
And, Scotty,
get that damn car
back.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.250
(Goran)
'Used to design
all sorts of nasty'

23:26.333 --> 23:28.917
explosives
with military applications.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.542
Lucrative, yes.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.417
But also insane.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.083
I prefer teaching.

23:34.166 --> 23:37.250
Detective Vera asked you to
review the JD Billingsley
case?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.291
Given that he was

23:38.375 --> 23:39.750
the original investigator

23:39.834 --> 23:42.333
and seemed quite
desperate, yes, I took a
look.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.750
Well, the fire marshal
determined that it was arson.

23:44.834 --> 23:47.125
Which frankly,
I found stunning.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.250
Though I shouldn't anymore.

23:48.333 --> 23:49.250
Why's that?

23:49.333 --> 23:50.959
Most fire marshals only have

23:51.041 --> 23:52.792
high school degree and certified

23:52.875 --> 23:55.834
after one 40-hour
course in fire
investigation.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.291
(Lilly)
Ray Crawford's been on the job

23:57.375 --> 24:00.000
30 years, he's done
hundreds of arson cases.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.750
Instincts and
experience is no
substitute

24:02.834 --> 24:04.083
for scientific method.

24:04.166 --> 24:07.083
And this finding
completely ignores
it.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.542
What did
you tell Detective Vera?

24:08.625 --> 24:11.000
I told him the truth.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.750
From the photos,
it appears that the
fire

24:12.834 --> 24:15.375
reached upwards
of 1,800
degrees.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.542
- Flashover from the
accelerant.
- Not necessarily.

24:17.625 --> 24:20.250
The temperature is
affected mostly by
ventilation.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.750
But what about the burn patterns

24:21.834 --> 24:24.375
and the...the puddle
configuration under the bed?

24:24.458 --> 24:27.792
The effects of flashover can
look like evidence of arson

24:27.875 --> 24:30.583
(Goran)
'but these
burn patterns aren't
indicative'

24:30.667 --> 24:32.959
of an accelerant.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.208
So how did the fire start?

24:34.291 --> 24:35.458
(Goran)
That's hard to
tell.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.709
From these pictures

24:36.792 --> 24:38.750
'it appears that
the point of origin'

24:38.834 --> 24:40.792
'was most likely the kitchen.'

24:42.291 --> 24:44.458
But you can't say
for sure what caused it?

24:44.542 --> 24:45.583
(Goran)
Not for
certain.

24:45.667 --> 24:46.583
Which why I'm baffled

24:46.667 --> 24:48.333
by the fire marshal's finding.

24:48.417 --> 24:50.125
Oh, Crawford's
been at it a long time.

24:50.208 --> 24:51.417
He learned from the old timers.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.166
Might explain
why it's based on,
uh

24:53.250 --> 24:55.000
junk science
and old wives'
tales.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.542
Yeah, but Joe Don, he escaped

24:56.625 --> 24:57.625
with no burns on his feet.

24:57.709 --> 24:58.709
How's that possible?

24:58.792 --> 25:00.542
Because fire burns upward.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.291
And one that reaches flashover

25:02.375 --> 25:04.250
is the next hottest
thing
to hell.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.583
And unless you're
confronted
with that type of heat

25:06.667 --> 25:09.750
you just can't understand
it,
detective.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.667
You're right. I don't.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.208
He left his kids inside.

25:13.291 --> 25:14.500
As soon as he went outside

25:14.583 --> 25:15.542
to find another way in

25:15.625 --> 25:18.417
he just let in more oxygen.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.291
Fed the beast.

25:20.375 --> 25:24.375
Even a fireman wouldn't
go
back into this blast
furnace.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.166
So what you're saying is..

25:28.250 --> 25:31.041
...it's possible Joe Don
was telling me the truth?

25:31.125 --> 25:33.750
I see no evidence of arson.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.750
That's good. Right?

25:38.917 --> 25:40.834
If he wasn't already dead.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.667
Seemed to take
the news pretty
hard.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.208
You think the fire
started in the kitchen.

25:48.291 --> 25:49.667
Older house like that

25:49.750 --> 25:52.291
nine times
out of ten, it's faulty
wiring.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.709
Yeah, but there's
no way to tell for sure.

25:54.792 --> 25:56.750
Usually, there'd
be some prior
issues

25:56.834 --> 25:59.709
with overloaded
circuits, browning
outlets.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.458
But you'd have to ask
somebody who lived in the home.

26:02.542 --> 26:03.792
(Jeannette)
'Joe Don getting killed'

26:03.875 --> 26:07.875
all these detectives
coming round here again.

26:07.959 --> 26:09.750
It's like the
nightmare never
ends.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.500
Detective Vera
came by here?

26:11.583 --> 26:12.458
Yesterday.

26:12.542 --> 26:13.875
Asking me all those questions

26:13.959 --> 26:15.667
about things
I'd rather not
relive.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.083
Going over your statement.

26:17.166 --> 26:21.667
I didn't care to
but I trust Detective
Vera.

26:21.750 --> 26:25.041
Joe Don was pretty
upset when I moved
out.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.625
He lost his job.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.000
Drinking too much.

26:28.083 --> 26:31.083
He just.. He wasn't
the same man I
married.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.417
I filed for separation

26:32.500 --> 26:37.083
and...then he...
he found out I was
dating.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.667
He threaten you or the kids?

26:38.750 --> 26:41.959
He said some
pretty...terrible
things.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.333
But, um..

26:48.375 --> 26:51.500
...I couldn't deny
the boys their
father.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.375
(Jeannette)
You know, when
they told me
that

26:53.458 --> 26:55.542
he set the house on fire

26:55.625 --> 26:58.083
I couldn't believe it.

26:58.166 --> 26:59.542
You know..

27:01.166 --> 27:05.792
...nobody should
experience a loss like
that.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.709
Jeannette, did
Detective Vera

27:07.792 --> 27:10.333
ask you anything
else about the house?

27:10.417 --> 27:15.041
He kept asking about
when I lived in the
house.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.166
About the kitchen.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.875
He said he'd never let
another man raise his boys.

27:20.959 --> 27:22.709
I lost everything.

27:22.792 --> 27:25.458
Jeannette, I need to ask
you
about the time before you
left

27:25.542 --> 27:27.000
when you
still lived in the
house.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.917
Do you remember
any electrical
problems

27:29.000 --> 27:30.333
with the lights
or the outlets?

27:30.417 --> 27:32.542
What problems
didn't the house have?

27:32.625 --> 27:34.834
Lights were always
flickering on and off.

27:34.917 --> 27:36.125
Did you tell your landlord?

27:36.208 --> 27:37.875
Cheap bastard
never fixed anything.

27:37.959 --> 27:40.542
Do you remember any problems
with the wiring in the
kitchen?

27:40.625 --> 27:41.834
The switches
or the
outlets?

27:41.917 --> 27:44.625
Why are you asking me this?

27:44.709 --> 27:46.917
He's dead, my kids are gone.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.625
- It's important.
- Why?

27:52.500 --> 27:55.333
I don't know how
to say this but..

27:55.417 --> 27:57.709
...it's possible Joe
Don
didn't set that fire.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.375
You must be joking.

28:03.458 --> 28:05.792
You're the one
who told me he did it.

28:05.875 --> 28:08.000
The police,
the fire department

28:08.083 --> 28:10.250
the lawyers,
it has to be true!

28:10.333 --> 28:11.583
I'm not so sure anymore.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.542
Well, I don't
have any doubt, detective.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.208
You tell me how a man

28:15.291 --> 28:18.917
doesn't run back in
there to save his own sons.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.583
The neighbors,
they saw him on the street

28:21.667 --> 28:23.750
while my babies burned up.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.583
How could
he not go back in there?

28:25.667 --> 28:26.875
Tell me that!

28:28.458 --> 28:30.917
Those were your kids,
would you stand
outside

28:31.041 --> 28:33.709
while they burned alive?

28:33.792 --> 28:37.000
Jeannette, what was wrong
with the wiring in the house?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.208
You know, every time
you'd plug in the toaster

28:39.291 --> 28:41.250
the fridge would go out.

28:41.333 --> 28:42.417
In the kitchen?

28:42.500 --> 28:45.083
One time
the outlet melted
down.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.583
I lost a bunch
of breast milk.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.125
Joe Don finally
called
an electrician

28:48.208 --> 28:50.667
and the landlord
got all upset about
it.

28:50.750 --> 28:51.792
The landlord?

28:51.875 --> 28:53.333
Bela.

28:53.417 --> 28:55.000
He only wanted to use
his handyman

28:55.083 --> 28:56.792
to fix everything
on the cheap.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.125
Look, I-I don't understand

28:58.208 --> 29:00.291
why you keep asking me
about the house.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.792
Should talk
to insurance
company.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.583
I'm still trying to
get them to pay up.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.083
Oh, that's got to be
rough on you, Bela.

29:05.166 --> 29:08.875
Yeah, I should not
have rented to that
family.

29:08.959 --> 29:10.667
(Bela)
Now, that man was
alcoholic.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.500
It's always bad when man
of house cannot hold on to
job.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.959
Understand that house
had a lot of electrical
issues.

29:17.041 --> 29:19.125
Issues? No issues.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.667
You cannot put blame
on me for what happened.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.333
Oh, we didn't say that, Bela.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.792
Maybe we should talk
to your handyman.

29:25.875 --> 29:28.667
Why you detectives
keep harassing me?

29:28.750 --> 29:31.667
(Lilly)
So what happened when Joe Don
hired his own electrician?

29:31.750 --> 29:33.917
Oh, that stupid
waste of money.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You know how much
electrician charges per
hour?

29:36.083 --> 29:38.458
Yeah, sounded
like you needed one.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.125
Joe Don was problem tenant.

29:41.208 --> 29:44.250
Always overloading
circuits, clogging up
pipes

29:44.333 --> 29:46.625
asking for more time
before paying rent,
always!

29:46.709 --> 29:49.667
No, the way we heard it, your
handyman couldn't fix
anything.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.500
(Scotty)
There's old wiring,
lights flickering

29:51.583 --> 29:53.458
browning outlets,
and you send over

29:53.542 --> 29:55.000
a guy who can't
screw in a light bulb.

29:55.083 --> 29:56.625
That's ridiculous.

29:56.709 --> 29:58.291
Jorge is very good handyman.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.542
I know him personally.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.041
Joe Don's ex told us
a kitchen outlet melted.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.375
He told them just

30:03.458 --> 30:06.125
"plug it into the bottom".
That your idea?

30:11.333 --> 30:12.917
I am not negligent.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.625
I have lawyers
who can prove
this.

30:15.709 --> 30:17.375
Yeah, sure you do.

30:17.458 --> 30:20.458
Look, I manage three
apartment buildings.

30:20.542 --> 30:23.000
People always
want something for
nothing.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.291
Never mind
if it's a fire hazard.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.667
I did not start that fire.

30:30.709 --> 30:32.291
This is not my fault.

30:32.375 --> 30:36.291
Oh, yeah, it...
It's nobody's fault.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.333
Hey, call just came in.

30:39.417 --> 30:40.834
Got a jumper
at 12th and Ridge.

30:40.917 --> 30:43.834
It's two blocks up
from Nick's place.

30:58.959 --> 31:00.709
White male,
40s, heavyset.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.291
- No ID?
- Nada.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.250
Face is
messed up from the swan dive.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.125
(uniform cop)
'Six stories up.'

31:06.208 --> 31:08.125
Lil.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.959
That ain't him.

31:24.667 --> 31:25.792
It's good you got
that department
vehicle

31:25.875 --> 31:27.458
back in
serviceable
condition.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.625
Any such luck
with your detective?

31:29.709 --> 31:31.625
No.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.709
Hey, that's too bad.

31:34.709 --> 31:35.959
Do what you've got to do.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.208
You know, John

31:43.291 --> 31:44.792
(Pat)
'I know you think I hate
you.'

31:44.875 --> 31:46.917
That I'm after you because
of what you did to my son

31:47.000 --> 31:48.041
15 years ago.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.750
- Pat--
- No, let me finish.

31:52.959 --> 31:54.959
I know Matt was a screw up.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.333
Wife and I,
we tried everything.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.125
Rehab, kicked
him out of the house.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.208
More rehab, none of it worked.

32:00.291 --> 32:01.667
Now, this
is none of my business.

32:01.750 --> 32:04.125
No, it was everybody's
business. That was the problem.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.625
Everybody in
this whole damn department

32:05.709 --> 32:06.750
knew that he was my son.

32:06.834 --> 32:08.166
(Pat)
'So every time he got
arrested'

32:08.250 --> 32:10.208
'he got a pass, skated
by, and Matt knew it.'

32:10.291 --> 32:12.959
He counted on it.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.375
Till you finally locked him up.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.166
- I don't need to hear this.
- No, you do.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.792
I had to, Pat!
It was his fourth time!

32:20.458 --> 32:24.041
It took my kid a long time
to get straightened out,
John.

32:24.125 --> 32:27.333
(Pat)
'Getting a job
is tough with a record.'

32:27.417 --> 32:29.000
But, finally, he did it.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.875
He even got married.

32:32.834 --> 32:35.792
Last month..

32:35.875 --> 32:38.667
...he actually
gave me a grandson.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.709
I heard. Congratulations.

32:42.792 --> 32:46.875
Which is right about when I
finally admitted to myself

32:46.959 --> 32:48.542
that getting locked
up was the best thing

32:48.625 --> 32:50.875
that ever happened to my son.

32:52.458 --> 32:55.834
Which, I guess, is my
roundabout way of saying

32:55.917 --> 32:57.041
you were right.

32:58.542 --> 32:59.917
So, I'm going to
return the favor.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.083
Pat, it was a long time ago.

33:01.166 --> 33:05.375
When or if you
get your detective back

33:05.458 --> 33:07.583
I expect you to do the same.

33:10.083 --> 33:11.375
- Nick?
- 'Take him off line.'

33:11.458 --> 33:12.875
'Send him
to psych services.'

33:12.959 --> 33:15.792
If that doesn't work,
take away his badge.

33:16.959 --> 33:18.208
(Pat)
'Take care of it, John.'

33:18.291 --> 33:20.041
I realize now
it's the only way.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.083
Yeah, okay, thanks.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.417
That was the fire station.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.041
Said Nick was
just there 15 minutes
ago.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.792
- Got into it with Crawford.
- Fight?

33:30.875 --> 33:32.125
Said it got pretty
heated
until some

33:32.208 --> 33:33.583
firemen jumped
in and Nick took
off.

33:33.667 --> 33:34.917
Alright, call Lil and Scotty.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.166
See if they can catch up to him.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.417
The balls
on that guy coming in
here

33:38.500 --> 33:40.583
going at me how I do my job!

33:40.667 --> 33:42.083
Who the hell's he think he is?

33:42.166 --> 33:44.166
- Calm down, Ray.
- 'Don't tell me to calm
down!'

33:44.250 --> 33:46.458
How would you like it
some fireman marches

33:46.542 --> 33:49.667
into the PPD, saying
you messed up a case?

33:49.750 --> 33:51.333
He came at you
about Billingsley?

33:51.417 --> 33:53.542
Whatever! Son of a bitch!

33:53.625 --> 33:55.917
This about half hour ago?
He on foot?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.625
Hell if I know. Couple of the
guys tossed him out on his
ear.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.250
He's lucky
I didn't break his
jaw!

34:00.333 --> 34:02.583
Yeah, alright, alright.
Just tell us what
happened.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.917
I've been a fire marshal
before he was a beat cop.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.875
Don't tell me
what's arson and what
ain't.

34:10.375 --> 34:11.959
Take a look
at the file, Ray.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.667
There were electrical
problems in the house.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.458
No residue of
a petroleum-based accelerant.

34:15.542 --> 34:17.625
You're out
of your freaking
mind.

34:17.709 --> 34:18.709
Just take a look
at the file, please.

34:18.792 --> 34:20.208
I've heard about enough.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.250
Get the hell out of here.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.542
I don't think he did it, Ray.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.667
I don't really care
what you think.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.041
I know it's arson

34:26.125 --> 34:28.417
just like you know
a murder when you see it.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.959
He never gave it up!
That never bothered
you?

34:30.041 --> 34:31.750
What are you talking about?

34:31.834 --> 34:34.000
Forty eight hours in the box,
I never got him to give it up.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.417
He always
maintained his
innocence.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.458
That don't bother you?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.458
No, that's between him and God.

34:39.542 --> 34:40.792
I went on
what you told me,
Ray.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.041
That it had to be arson.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.709
Wh-what are you saying,
that I'm wrong, Nick?

34:43.792 --> 34:46.125
- That this is all on me?
- No, no, I'm not saying
that.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.792
Don't forget, you took
the witness statements.

34:48.875 --> 34:51.667
You testified on the
stand to his state of mind.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.500
- Ain't denying that.
- The guy was a drunk!

34:54.583 --> 34:55.959
He's a terrible husband!

34:56.041 --> 34:57.959
Pissed off at
his wife, at the world.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.166
Been there.
All those things,
myself.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.834
It doesn't mean
that he killed his
kids.

35:01.917 --> 35:03.667
Oh, cry me a river.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.917
Joe Don Billingsley
didn't deserve what
happened!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.125
He didn't deserve to die!

35:07.208 --> 35:10.000
Boo-hoo! Live with it.

35:10.083 --> 35:11.250
We gotta
make this right
somehow.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.834
There is nothing to fix!

35:12.917 --> 35:15.333
Guy's dead and gone.

35:15.417 --> 35:18.500
His ex-wife still thinks
that he killed her kids.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.333
His own parents think that
he killed their grandkids!

35:21.417 --> 35:23.625
Guess what? So do I.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.917
And that's
the way it's gonna stay.

35:26.000 --> 35:26.959
Hey!

35:27.041 --> 35:28.375
You do what you got to do!

35:28.458 --> 35:29.750
I know what I got to do!

35:29.834 --> 35:31.959
I know what I got to do!

35:32.041 --> 35:34.792
Nobody comes in here and
talks to me like that.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.709
He said something
about Joe Don's parents.

35:36.792 --> 35:37.709
Making it right?

35:37.792 --> 35:38.875
I don't know what he's gonna

35:38.959 --> 35:42.375
do and frankly, I don't care.

35:42.458 --> 35:45.083
So why wouldn't you look
at the evidence again,
Ray?

35:46.500 --> 35:50.000
You seriously entertaining
reopening this case?

35:51.083 --> 35:53.667
Get the hell out of my house.

36:12.458 --> 36:15.083
(Lilly)
'Nick! Get in.'

36:28.166 --> 36:30.458
Joe Don's
parents' house,
huh?

36:30.542 --> 36:32.917
Been out here what?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.834
An hour?

36:36.834 --> 36:38.917
Just trying to figure out
what to say.

36:41.208 --> 36:44.250
You had a busy 48 hours.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.959
You had us all worried.

36:47.041 --> 36:48.875
Have I been fired yet?

36:48.959 --> 36:51.125
Maybe the boss can
pull some strings.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.542
For both of us.

36:53.625 --> 36:54.667
You?

36:54.750 --> 36:57.125
Considering I covered up a DUI.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.542
Sorry about that.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.792
You're a good cop, Nick..

37:06.875 --> 37:09.667
...but you need help.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.834
I saw my my ex-wife Julie.

37:13.792 --> 37:15.291
She's got two kids.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.125
I always thought
that that'd be me.

37:19.208 --> 37:20.667
No, it's never too late.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.250
I'm happy for her.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.125
Back when they caught this case

37:28.208 --> 37:32.834
it's all I
wanted was a kid, a family.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.041
And then when I saw
that burnt-out
bedroom..

37:36.125 --> 37:37.458
And the kids..

37:37.542 --> 37:39.166
Yeah.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.667
'Yeah, I sat down in the box'

37:40.750 --> 37:41.834
across from this man

37:41.917 --> 37:44.792
this father that had

37:44.875 --> 37:46.291
had burned his kids alive

37:46.375 --> 37:49.625
and I couldn't believe
someone could do that.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.041
Did he?

37:53.125 --> 37:55.542
I went at him
day and night,
Lil.

37:55.625 --> 37:58.583
I knew something
wasn't right in my
gut.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.792
I kept looking for that
one thing in his story

38:00.875 --> 38:04.792
that one slip
that just lets
you..

38:04.875 --> 38:06.083
...lets you know he's a liar.

38:06.166 --> 38:09.125
Just needed one slip.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.542
But he never did.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.250
I didn't need a
statement to get a conviction.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.500
I had everything.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.917
I was just so sure
he'd done it.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.667
And you weren't
the only one,
Nick.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.834
Firemen call it the "beast".

38:28.750 --> 38:30.834
Flashover.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.500
It only got hotter
when he went outside

38:32.583 --> 38:36.041
trying to find another
way back to get his
kids.

38:36.125 --> 38:37.208
But he couldn't.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.542
I just couldn't get
my head around that.

38:39.625 --> 38:40.792
What that was like?

38:40.875 --> 38:42.917
I thought for sure
he'd set that fire.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.333
And he tried to tell me,
and I couldn't hear it.

38:47.417 --> 38:48.375
He tried to tell you what?

38:48.458 --> 38:50.875
That he wasn't a killer.

38:50.959 --> 38:52.125
He was just afraid.

38:52.208 --> 38:53.625
Afraid for his own life.

38:53.709 --> 38:58.458
And for that,
I couldn't forgive
him.

38:58.542 --> 39:00.417
It was you, Joe Don.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.667
You started that fire
you burned up those kids.

39:02.750 --> 39:05.500
No, I could never do that.

39:05.583 --> 39:07.917
I would never hurt them.
I loved my boys.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.583
Really? Then how could you just
leave them in there to die?

39:10.667 --> 39:14.750
I just...the fire,
it was everywhere.

39:14.834 --> 39:17.583
It was so hot.
You have no idea.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.000
(Nick)
'You're right, I don't.'

39:19.083 --> 39:20.625
You had plenty of time
to go in there and get them
out.

39:20.709 --> 39:26.583
No, I thought I could,
but it happened so fast and..

39:26.667 --> 39:30.083
...and then I was on fire.

39:30.166 --> 39:33.667
'The fire,
it was, it was everywhere.'

39:33.750 --> 39:38.875
- And the heat, my God..
- Help me believe you.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.959
[pounding on table]
'How does a father
not go back inside'

39:41.041 --> 39:42.166
and get his own boys out?

39:42.250 --> 39:43.583
I don't know.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.125
You see, a man, a man would do

39:45.208 --> 39:48.083
anything to save his own.

39:48.166 --> 39:49.333
I tried.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.709
I really tried.

39:59.375 --> 40:00.792
I don't believe you.

40:00.875 --> 40:02.625
You're a liar.
You're a damn liar.

40:02.709 --> 40:04.208
[slamming]
How could you just stand by

40:04.291 --> 40:05.375
and let that happen?

40:05.458 --> 40:09.125
Help me understand that,
okay?

40:09.208 --> 40:13.125
- How?
- I don't know, alright?

40:13.208 --> 40:16.333
I just..

40:16.417 --> 40:19.041
...couldn't.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.166
I don't know.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.917
I mistook cowardice for guilt.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.417
It's an honest mistake, Nick.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.542
One that can't be made right.

40:39.083 --> 40:42.083
(Lilly)
'Well, look,
we'll talk to the DA.'

40:42.166 --> 40:44.917
We'll try to clear his name.

40:46.542 --> 40:48.333
Okay?

40:51.959 --> 40:54.375
First, I gotta do this.

41:12.917 --> 41:14.750
Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley,
I'm Detective Vera.

41:14.834 --> 41:16.583
I know who you are.

41:18.291 --> 41:19.750
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:19.834 --> 41:21.834
What do you want?

41:24.125 --> 41:25.709
There's been
some new evidence in the case

41:25.792 --> 41:27.375
and I know it will
never bring your son back

41:27.458 --> 41:28.875
but I want you to know

41:28.959 --> 41:31.166
I'm going to do everything
I can to clear his name.
