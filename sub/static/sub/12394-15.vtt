00:32.100 --> 00:34.193
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

TO BE LATE

03:08.750 --> 03:10.286

BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TWEETING.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.873

03:33.910 --> 03:35.798
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, LASSIE,

03:35.840 --> 03:36.647
THIS CAN'T BE YOUR SISTER.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.023
THE NAME IS BURTON,

IT WAS GONNA BE

04:36.870 --> 04:38.701
WHEN YOU HEARD

04:38.740 --> 04:40.901
SOME GUY GOT KILLED

CAN I DO THAT AGAIN?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.985

MY NAME IS GEMMA KRAEMER,

04:59.060 --> 05:01.790
AND THAT TRAINER
WAS MY FIANCE.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.697

AS A CUB.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.834
HE LOVED IT.
HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO IT.

05:10.870 --> 05:14.078
AND NOW THIS HAPPENS?
THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.577

LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW A DETECTIVE SURVEYS

05:33.800 --> 05:35.119
A CRIME SCENE.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.766
THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC METHOD
TO IT, AN ORDER.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.767
- LULU?

05:39.800 --> 05:41.791
- OH, IT'S SHORT FOR LEWIS.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.467
HE GAVE ME THE NICKNAME
WHEN I WAS A KID

05:43.510 --> 05:44.568
BECAUSE I WAS A TOMBOY.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.634
A LATE BLOOMER.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.831
- BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.336
- STOP IT.
STOP IT.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.109
- WOW. WHAT MUST IT BE LIKE
TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE

05:55.150 --> 05:57.618
TO WORK ALONGSIDE MY BROTHER
EVERY DAY?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.811
ISN'T HE AMAZING?
- YOU'RE AMAZING.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.748
THE WAY YOU PRESS
THAT RECORD BUTTON AND WHATNOT.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.781
- HE USED TO RUN HURDLES
IN HIGH SCHOOL

06:03.830 --> 06:04.751
UNTIL HE STRAINED
HIS GROIN.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.894
- YOU KNOW, GUS HERE
DOESN'T HAVE A GROIN.

06:06.930 --> 06:07.919
AND THAT'S A TRUE STORY.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.099
- OH.
- LULU!

06:10.130 --> 06:11.620
- WHY?

06:11.670 --> 06:12.739
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE BEING
SUPER CREEPY.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.862
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.891
SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.567
OUR TRAINER COMES
IN THE ENCLOSURE AFTER HOURS.

06:17.610 --> 06:18.565
HE STARTLES THE BEAR.

06:18.610 --> 06:19.929
BASED ON THE BLOOD SPLATTER,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.800
THE FIRST STRIKE IS HERE.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.807
THEN HE WAS KNOCKED
OVER THESE ROCKS,

06:22.850 --> 06:24.772
DRAGGED TO THIS POINT HERE.

06:24.810 --> 06:28.871
HE WAS ATTACKED AGAIN.
EVENTUALLY, HE ROLLED DOWN HERE,

06:28.920 --> 06:31.844
COMING TO A STOP,
WHERE HE EXPIRES

06:31.890 --> 06:34.415
ON THE STAIRS.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.729
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT SURE
HE DIDN'T JUST FALL.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.829
SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.656
- OKAY, LU,

06:41.700 --> 06:42.667
I'M GONNA BRING YOU
THE GOOD STUFF.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.521
I'M GONNA SAY,
"THE BEAR DID IT. CASE CLOSED."

06:45.570 --> 06:46.832
AT THAT POINT, YOU'RE
PROBABLY GONNA WANT TO COME IN

06:46.870 --> 06:51.739
NICE AND CLOSE
TO MY FACE, OKAY?

06:51.770 --> 06:55.570
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.168
- WAIT!

06:57.210 --> 07:00.919
WAIT.
I'M HAVING A THOUGHT.

07:00.950 --> 07:04.442
IT'S MORE OF A REVELATION.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.582
GAH !

07:05.620 --> 07:09.784
THAT POLAR BEAR
DID NOT COMMIT MURDER.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.659
IT WAS FRAMED.

THAT POLAR BEAR WAS FRAMED,

07:38.120 --> 07:40.179
WAS THAT A JOKE?

07:40.220 --> 07:41.687
- NOPE, NOT A JOKE.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.546
WHEN HE GETS OUT OF THE SHOWER.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.182
HE LIKES TO BE SWADDLED
AND BURPED.

08:11.220 --> 08:15.554
I BELIEVE THEY CALL THAT
BABYISM.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.182
- HE'S CRAZY.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.199
BE CAREFUL.
IT CAN GET HAIRY IN HERE.

08:20.230 --> 08:21.720
- OKAY.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.299
WOW, THAT REALLY IS
A DEAD BODY.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.831
IS IT WEIRD FOR YOU GUYS

08:27.870 --> 08:28.939
TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH A CORPSE?

08:28.970 --> 08:30.130
GUS?

08:30.170 --> 08:32.707
- OH, I'M FINE OVER HERE

08:32.740 --> 08:34.298
WITH THE BEAKERS AND WHATNOT.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.171
- JUST SO I CAN FINISH
THE PAPERWORK,

08:36.210 --> 08:37.177
TELL ME
THE BEAR KILLED THIS GUY.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.098
- IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION,

08:39.150 --> 08:41.539
THIS WAS DEFINITELY
A BEAR ATTACK.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.410
- THANK YOU.

08:42.450 --> 08:43.542
- CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
FOR THE CAMERA?

08:43.590 --> 08:44.682
- WHOA, WHOA, WHAT DO YOU--

08:44.720 --> 08:46.039
WAIT, DON'T DON'T.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.183
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT THE BEAR
DID NOT KILL THIS MAN?

08:48.220 --> 08:50.780
- ABSOLUTELY. SURE.
- WHAT? WHICH IS IT?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.229
- SORRY.
I'M A PEOPLE PLEASER.

08:52.260 --> 08:56.253
YOUNG LADY, WHAT MEDIA OUTLET
WERE YOU FROM AGAIN?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.768
- OH, IT'S
FOR MY GRADUATE THESIS FILM.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.267
- WILL IT BE ENTERED
IN ANY FESTIVALS

09:00.300 --> 09:03.701
IN THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE,
SPECIFICALLY THE PHILIPPINES?

09:03.740 --> 09:05.002
- MAYBE.
- OH, MY GOD.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.634
THIS IS GONNA BE IN FESTIVALS?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.274
- MAY WE GET ON WITH THE BODY,
PLEASE?

09:10.310 --> 09:12.847
- [distorted voice]
BROKEN BONES, CHECK.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.849
LACERATIONS, CHECK.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.189
CLAW MARKS, CHECK.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.585
- WHAT IS THAT VOICE?

09:19.620 --> 09:21.258
- I'M DISTORTING IT
FOR LEGAL REASONS.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.349
- THAT IS A PROCESS DONE
IN EDITING.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.221
- REALLY?
SEE, NOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT

09:25.260 --> 09:27.751
PEOPLE DID THNT'J THEMSELVES.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.620
- WELL, I'LL BE.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.796
HERE'S SOMETHING FUN.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.196
LET IT BE NOTED
THAT THE VICTIM'S LARYNX

09:33.240 --> 09:34.332
WAS CRUSHED.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.769
- HE WAS CHOKED?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.337
- POLAR BEARS
HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS NOW?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.359
NO.
AND WHAT ABOUT MOTIVE?

09:39.410 --> 09:40.206
YOU CAN'T CONVICT
WITHOUT MOTIVE.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.276
- I HAVE MOTIVE.
THE BEAR WENT BEAR.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.277
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
- NOT TRYING TO.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.141
- STOP HATING ON BEARS.
- IF THEY STOP FIRST.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.340
- COME ON, GUYS,
THIS BEAR

09:46.380 --> 09:47.813
IS GOING TO BE EUTHANIZED
FOR NO REASON.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.841
- UH, WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE ZOO.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.881
- O'HARA, STOP MAKING UP THINGS
TO GET ON CAMERA.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.218
- NOW.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.693
- OH.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.925
- SO, MR. BANTING,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.325
- THE POLAR BEAR BROKE OUT
OF THE CAGE.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.224
- AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED?

10:05.270 --> 10:07.966
HE JUST BOUGHT SOME COTTON CANDY
AND WALKED OUT OF THE ZOO?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.763
- WELL, BY THE TIME
MY TEAM REALIZED IT WAS MISSING,

10:09.810 --> 10:12.631
IT GOT TOO BIG OF A HEAD START.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.635
- WELL, I GUESS WE KNOW
WHAT THE BEAR WOULD DO

10:13.680 --> 10:17.104
FOR A KLONDIKE BAR.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.675
I JUST FELT LIKE MY CHARACTER
NEEDED A JOKE.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.369
- UH, WHAT IS THAT?

10:21.420 --> 10:22.648
- OH, THIS A RING-TAILED LEMUR.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.714
HE'S BEEN ACTING OUT,

10:23.750 --> 10:25.342
EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION,
VERY NEEDY.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.312
HENCE
THE ONE-ON-ONE ATTENTION.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.749
- DID YOU SEE ANY COCA-COLAS
OR A SLED?

10:29.790 --> 10:32.281
I BELIEVE THIS MIGHT BE
WHAT HE'S USING FOR NOURISHMENT,

10:32.330 --> 10:33.297
TRANSPORTATION.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.854
AND DID ANYONE SEE
A RED SCARF

10:34.900 --> 10:38.324
OR HEAR THE SOUND,
"WHEE!"?

10:38.370 --> 10:41.032
- THAT POLAR BEAR
WAS OUR MAIN ATTRACTION.

10:41.070 --> 10:44.267
COME ON, DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH
THOSE JUDGMENTAL EYES, TOBIAS.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.164
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
- I GOT BEAR TRACKS.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.336
HEADING NORTHWEST.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.677
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

10:48.710 --> 10:49.779
I WANT A HARD TARGET SEARCH

10:49.810 --> 10:50.777
ON THIS KILLER BEAR.

10:50.810 --> 10:51.845
WE'RE GONNA HUNT
THIS THING DOWN,

10:51.880 --> 10:53.916
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND IT.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.718
- LET'S GO.
- GO WHERE?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.286
- WHY ARE YOU HARASSING
THE LEMUR?

11:00.320 --> 11:01.287
- HE STARTED IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

11:01.320 --> 11:04.118
THERE'S AN INNOCENT BEAR
LOOSE IN SANTA BARBARA.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.320
WE NEED TO FIND IT.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.225
- IF THERE'S A LOOSE BEAR
RUNNING AROUND IN SANTA BARBARA,

11:07.260 --> 11:09.797
I'M NOT IN SANTA BARBARA.

11:14.470 --> 11:17.359
- YOU EVER KNOW A POLAR BEAR
THAT TRIED TO FORCE ITSELF

11:17.410 --> 11:18.934
INTO ITS CAGE?

11:18.970 --> 11:21.438
- NO, SHAWN, BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW ANY POLAR BEARS.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.230
AND NEITHER YOU DO.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.168
- SURE, THE FENCE
WAS PUSHED OUT,

11:24.210 --> 11:27.418
BUT THE HINGES BROKE INWARD,
AND THAT TELLS THE REAL STORY.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.488
- FREE THE BEAR!
FREE THE BEAR!

11:36.520 --> 11:38.021
FREE THE BEAR!

11:39.530 --> 11:41.828
- THAT BEAR DEFINITELY HAD HELP.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.090
AND I HAVE A DECENT IDEA
WHO'S BEHIND IT.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.825
- I'M OUT.
YOU GOT THIS ALONE.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.394
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.499
I DON'T EVEN LIKE BEARS
IN FABLES, SHAWN.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.360
GOLDILOCKS
WAS A CRAZY BLONDE SHORTY

11:51.410 --> 11:52.934
FOR GOING UP IN THAT HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.278
- DON'T SAY SHORTY.
- SHORTY.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.402
- YOU'RE GOING TO THE BUNNY DEN,
AREN'T YOU?

11:56.440 --> 11:57.998
- DON'T BE MAKING THAT
YOUR BUSINESS.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.108
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.276
- I'M DEEP IN THE STREETS,
SHAWN.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.345
- YOU'RE ON A WOODED PATH
TO NOWHERE.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.938
- JUST DON'T LIKE BEARS, SHAWN.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.088
- YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO BUY MY VAN, ARE YOU?

12:21.140 --> 12:22.869
- LOOK, I'M A PSYCHIC.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.003
I'M FILTHY GOOD.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.439
I HAVE AN APPETITE
FOR THE TRUTH.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.779
SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.402
WHERE IS THE BEAR?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.906
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BEAR.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.110
THE BEAR IS SAFE.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.277
I'M THE ONE THAT'S TRYING
TO KEEP IT

12:35.320 --> 12:36.412
FROM GETTING EUTHANIZED.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.338
- OH, THIS IS GREAT NEWS.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.358
THAT MEANS WE'RE PLAYING
FOR THE SAME TEAM.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.812
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE THE SAME.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.782
EXCEPT I SHOWER OCCASIONALLY.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.320
AND I WORKED
AT AN ARBY'S ONCE.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.327
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

12:46.360 --> 12:48.294
I'M NOT JUST SOME RANDOM
TREE HUGGER, ALL RIGHT?

12:48.330 --> 12:50.366
DON'T TRY TO PUT ME
IN YOUR LITTLE BOX.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.163
HERE'S ONE I BET
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.360
I MAKE MY OWN BATH SALTS.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.367
- SURPRISING.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.368
- I MAKE PEOPLE SMELL
LIKE PLUMS AND SUNSHINE.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.367
YEAH, I DO THAT.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.401
- CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

12:59.440 --> 13:02.978
- UH, LET'S SEE.

13:03.010 --> 13:06.047
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL HAVE THE BEEF DIP.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.374
I'M JUST KIDDING.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.050
SHE TOOK THAT SO SERIOUSLY.
- LISTEN TO ME.

13:13.090 --> 13:15.513
THAT BEAR IS INNOCENT.
YOU GOT ME?

13:15.560 --> 13:16.925
THAT BEAR DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.928
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.099
- AND I MEANT IT.
GIVEN TIME, I WILL PROVE IT.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.927
I WILL FIND THE KILLER.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.165
BUT THINK ABOUT THIS, DUDE,

13:25.200 --> 13:26.394
I FOUND YOU PRETTY EASILY.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.864
WHICH MEANS THE HEAD OF THE
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

13:28.900 --> 13:30.265
AND A BUNCH
OF ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS

13:30.310 --> 13:32.039
AREN'T FAR BEHIND.
- IT'S JUST--

13:32.070 --> 13:35.437
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLACES
TO TAKE A POLAR BEAR

13:35.480 --> 13:38.574
IN THIS CITY.
- BUT YOU'RE IN LUCK.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.874
YOU SEE,
POLAR BEAR RELOCATION

13:40.920 --> 13:43.514
JUST HAPPENS
TO BE MY SPECIALTY, JACK.

13:43.550 --> 13:46.383
THAT AND MARZIPAN SUGAR
SCULPTING.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.150
SO YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE BEAR IS,

13:49.190 --> 13:52.580
I WILL HELP YOU,
AND I WILL HELP THE BEAR.

13:52.630 --> 13:55.155
AND I WILL SCULPT YOU A SWAN

13:55.200 --> 13:56.292
MADE ENTIRELY OF MOLASSES.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.060
- I WANT A TURTLE.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.988
- DONE.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.400
- [mutters to himself]

14:06.440 --> 14:08.431
THERE IT IS.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.618
YEAH.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.629
- [roars]

14:42.040 --> 14:43.473
- [roars]

14:43.510 --> 14:47.947
- DUDE, DUDE, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING HERE.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.277
- I DON'T THINK YOU DO,
SHAWN.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.685
- GUS, I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.211
THIS IS MACLEOD SINCLAIRE.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.319
HE IS AN ACT IVIST,
AND HE KNOWS BEARS.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.349
EVEN THE ONES
THAT ARE BAD NEWS.

14:56.390 --> 14:59.154
IN FACT, HE LIVED
AMONGST THEM AT YELLOWSTONE,

14:59.190 --> 15:01.420
AND HE HAS
A SIGNED DAN HAGGERTY 8X10.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.098
SO YOU KNOW
WE'RE IN GOOD HANDS HERE.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.597
- UNLESS YOU TELL ME
HE HAS SUPER POWERS,

15:04.630 --> 15:07.235
AND ONE OF THEM BEING
STRONGER THAN A BEAR...

15:07.270 --> 15:08.567
- GUS, SEE THAT WIRE?

15:08.600 --> 15:11.433
THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS AN ELECTRIC FENCE.

15:11.470 --> 15:15.474
AND THE BEAR IS TRAINED
NOT TO CROSS IT.

15:15.510 --> 15:16.670
- IT'S NOT
A REAL ELECTRIC FENCE.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.644
IT'S JUST THERE
TO FOOL THE BEAR.

15:20.450 --> 15:23.010
[crash]

15:23.050 --> 15:25.189
- HOW DID THAT MAKE SENSE
TO SAY ALOUD?

15:25.220 --> 15:27.279
DUDE.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.311
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE UPTIGHT ONE HERE,

15:29.360 --> 15:32.181
BUT WE SIMPLY CANNOT KEEP A BEAR
IN THE PSYCH OFFICE,

15:32.230 --> 15:34.448
HELD IN BY A PIECE
OF KITE STRING.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.353
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, HUH?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.220
TAKE IT FOR A STROLL
ON THE BOARDWALK?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.294
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT HIDDEN.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.490
MAN, LASSIE IS OUT THERE

15:39.530 --> 15:41.589
WITH EVERY AVAILABLE SOURCE
OF MANPOWER HUNTING IT DOWN.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.562
- HE'S HUNTING IT
BECAUSE IT KILLS THINGS, SHAWN.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.237
- YOU KNOW WHO KILLS THINGS?

15:45.270 --> 15:46.259
ZOOS.

15:46.310 --> 15:47.436
ZOOS KILL THINGS.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.277
MIND IF I GET
ON MY SOAPBOX HERE?

15:49.310 --> 15:50.504
- I'D PREFER YOU GET
IN THE SOAPBOX.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.074
- I SHOWERED YESTERDAY.

15:52.110 --> 15:53.543
- YOU REALIZE THAT'S THE DAY
BEFORE TODAY.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.673
- LOOK, THE POINT IS, OKAY,

15:55.720 --> 15:58.484
IS THAT KEEPING ANIMALS
IN FAKE ROCK HABITATS

15:58.520 --> 16:00.317
WITH PLASTIC KIDDIE POOLS
IS CRIMINAL.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.715
ANYONE THAT HAD ANY HEART,
ANY COMPASSION AT ALL,

16:02.760 --> 16:04.728
WOULD SHUT DOWN ALL 2005,
ESPECIALLY ONE THAT WOULD KEEP

16:04.760 --> 16:07.251
A POLAR BEAR
IN THOSE CONDITIONS.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.598
ANIMALS WERE NOT MEANT
TO BE IN CAPTIVITY.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.029
- OR IN MY OFFICE.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.298
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

16:12.330 --> 16:13.638
I DON'T FEEL
ONE OUNCE OF SYMPATHY

16:13.670 --> 16:15.433
FOR THAT TRAINER, MAN.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.233
YOU ASK ME,
HE HAD IT COMING.

16:17.270 --> 16:18.339
OH, YEAH.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.736
- WILL YOU EXCUSE US
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT, MACLEOD?

16:20.780 --> 16:23.271
- SURE.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.278
- ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.441
WHO HAD A DEATH WISH
FOR OUR VICTIM?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.789
- OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE TOTALLY
AIDING AND ABETTING A MURDERER.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.048
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING,
SHAWN.

16:33.090 --> 16:34.284
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT

16:34.320 --> 16:35.514
THE WORLD'S LARGEST
TERRESTRIAL PREDATOR

16:35.560 --> 16:37.482
INTO OUR KITCHENETTE.
- WELL, EITHER WAY,

16:37.530 --> 16:38.428
WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE
SO WE CAN PROVE IT.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.257
- I AGREE.
- AND WE NEED TO TAKE THE BEAR.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.426
- I DO NOT AGREE, SHAWN.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.394
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- MACLEOD!

16:43.430 --> 16:45.193
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT A COFFEE RUN, MAN?

16:45.230 --> 16:46.322
I'M BUYING.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.689
- IS IT ORGANIC?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.368
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.809
THIS BEAR SPENT THE NIGHT
SOMEWHERE,

16:51.840 --> 16:53.478
AND IT'S PROBABLY HUNGRY BY NOW.

16:53.510 --> 16:56.070
THERE ARE MORE RESTAURANTS
AND DUMPSTERS PER SQUARE FOOT

16:56.110 --> 16:58.203
IN THIS AREA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
IN THE CITY.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.514
WE WILL COVER EVERY ALLEYWAY,
EVERY BACK WAY,

17:00.550 --> 17:03.644
EVERY ROOFTOP
UNTIL WE FIND IT.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.510
THIS BEAR WILL NOT ESCAPE ME.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.778
LET'S GO.
FAN OUT.

17:06.820 --> 17:10.483
GET IT.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.656
- ARE WE SERIOUSLY DOING THIS?

17:11.690 --> 17:13.499
- LOOK, I CALLED BENIHANA,

17:13.530 --> 17:15.521
AND MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN,
THEY COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE

17:15.560 --> 17:17.699
A TABLE FOR TWO
PLUS AN 800-POUND POLAR BEAR.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.789
WE NEED TO START THINKING
LIKE A BEAR.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.060
- I'M NOT GONNA MAUL
AN INNOCENT HIKER, SHAWN.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.102
- HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO CRABBY MEL'S.

17:24.140 --> 17:26.665
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?
- UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT, A COKE?

17:26.710 --> 17:29.599
CAN WE HAVE TWO COKES,
A LARGE FRY,

17:29.640 --> 17:34.270
AND 128 CRABBY MEL
FISH SANDWICHES.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.776
TARTAR SAUCE,
NO BUNS.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.788
- SHAWN.
- WHAT?

17:37.820 --> 17:39.515
WE NEED TO PAY A VISIT
TO THE TRAINER'S HOUSE.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.256
WHOEVER WANTED HIM DEAD
MAY HAVE LEFT A TRAIL.

17:41.290 --> 17:42.848
OR A PICNIC BASKET.

17:42.890 --> 17:45.757
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER
ASKING LASSITER TO GET A KEY?

17:45.790 --> 17:47.519
- IT'S MUCH, MUCH EASIER
THIS WAY.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.629
- FOR WHO?
- YOU KNOW

17:48.660 --> 17:49.695
YOU HAVE A BETTER EQUILIBRIUM

17:49.730 --> 17:52.267
WITH THOSE STAUNCH
BIRTHING HIPS.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.562
- HURRY UP
BEFORE THE NEIGHBORS SEE US

17:53.600 --> 17:54.635
AND SOMEONE CALLS THE COPS.

17:54.670 --> 17:55.864
- I NEED CLOSER.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.367
- AAGH!

18:01.280 --> 18:02.770
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
ANYTHING YET?

18:02.810 --> 18:05.506
- I DID FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.711
I REALLY ENJOY BEING LIFTED.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.445
- EXCUSE ME.
CAN I HELP YOU?

18:09.480 --> 18:11.687
- UH, YES.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.518
HAVE YOU SEEN ANOTHER SET
OF GUYS THAT LOOK LIKE US?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.551
WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST TRACK
OF OUR CHICKEN FIGHT.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.657
- THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.521
I AM NOT EVEN REMOTELY JOKING.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.596
IF ANY OF YOU
HAVE SEEN THIS BEAR,

18:23.630 --> 18:24.767
YOU BETTER TELL ME NOW.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.688
YOU MAY THINK
IT'S A BIG, FLUFFY TOY,

18:26.730 --> 18:29.460
BUT I ASSURE YOU
THIS IS NO TEDDY BEAR.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.707
THIS CREATURE WILL KILL YOU.

18:31.740 --> 18:35.403
MOST OF YOU,
IT COULD SWALLOW YOU WHOLE.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.601
YOU, TINY,
YOU WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.242
WHAT, YOU THINK
YOUR BUDDIES ARE GONNA HELP YOU

18:39.280 --> 18:40.508
WHEN YOU'RE SCREAMING

18:40.550 --> 18:41.869
AND A BEAR'S RIPPING
YOUR FACE OFF? NO.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.547
YOU LIKE HAVING ARMS?
HUH?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.717
THOSE WOULD BE APPETIZERS
FOR THIS THING.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.785
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.811
YOU THINK I'M JOKING?

18:48.860 --> 18:51.158
- JUST LOOK FOR STUFF, GUS.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.589
- LIKE WHAT?

18:52.630 --> 18:53.699
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.699
ANYTHING THAT SEEMS SUSPICIOUS.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.324
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.190
THIS IS SOMETHING.
- WHAT IS IT?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.696
- A COPY
OF AN INSURANCE POLICY.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.264
- THE TRAINER'S LIFE INSURANCE?

19:04.310 --> 19:05.459
- NOPE. THE BEAR'S.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.637
AND IT'S WORTH MORE DEAD
THAN ALIVE.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.739
PAYOUT IS $2 MILLION.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.577
- THAT WOULD MAKE THE TRAINER
A RICH MAN.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.840
- NO, IT WOULD MAKE
C. LEE BANTING A RICH MAN.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.541
HE TOOK OUT THE POLICY.
- THAT POLAR BEAR

19:15.580 --> 19:17.548
WAS OUR MAIN ATTRACTION.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.581
- C. LEE BANTING,
THE ZOO DIRECTOR?

19:19.620 --> 19:20.882
SO WHY DOES THE TRAINER
HAVE A COPY?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.512
- I'M GUESSING
HE MADE HIMSELF ONE

19:22.560 --> 19:24.551
BECAUSE HE WAS SUSPICIOUS
OF BANTING'S INTENTIONS.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.251
- SO YOU THINK BANTING
IS OUR NEW MURDERER?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.225
- WELL, WE KNOW THE ZOO'S
LOSING MONEY PAW OVER FIST.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.899
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATION
TO SEE THIS POOR BEAR DEAD.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.660
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.190
- LUNCH?

19:36.240 --> 19:37.537
DAD,

19:37.570 --> 19:38.605
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU'RE COMING HOME

19:38.640 --> 19:40.528
FOR LUNCH TODAY?
- NO.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.536
SADLY, I AM NOT.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.549
- REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD ME
YOU CAUGHT THAT 40-POUND SALMON,

19:45.580 --> 19:47.639
IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE YOU
A YEAR TO EAT IT?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.545
IS THERE ANY OF THAT LEFT?

19:49.580 --> 19:51.514
- SHAWN, WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
INTERESTED IN MY SALMON?

19:51.550 --> 19:52.812
[knock at door]

19:52.850 --> 19:53.851
- GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.687
- SHAWN.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.224
- JULES.
- WHERE'S THE BEAR, SHAWN?

20:00.260 --> 20:03.468
- WHAT WOULD POSSIBLY MAKE YOU
BELIEVE I HAVE ANY IDEA

20:03.500 --> 20:05.889
WHERE THIS BEAR IS?
- OH, WELL, UM, FIRST OFF,

20:05.930 --> 20:08.296
SOMEONE CALLED IN A TIP
ABOUT A TINY BLUE CAR

20:08.340 --> 20:10.763
DRIVING AN ENORMOUS TRAILER
DOWN MARIPOSA.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.562
SECONDLY,
I'M DATING YOU,

20:12.610 --> 20:13.702
AND I KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE LYING,

20:13.740 --> 20:14.672
AND, THIRD, THERE ARE, LIKE,

20:14.710 --> 20:17.247
300 PACKETS OF TARTAR SAUCE
ON THE DOORSTEP.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.372
- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.275
I'M GONNA START WATCHING
MY CHOLESTEROL.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.618
- [gaSPSJ
- HELLO, BEAR.

20:23.650 --> 20:24.981
HELLO, POLAR BEAR.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.352
OH, YOU WANT
SOME MORE FISH SANDWICHES?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.489
- OH, MY GOD.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.521
I'M DOING THIS
TO PROTECT YOU.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.653
- FROM THE BEAR? NO.
IT'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.997
- NO, FROM YOURSELF.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.588
SHAWN, YOU ARE NOT THINKING
STRAIGHT.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.723
YOU HAVE STOLEN A BEAR
WHO IS A PRIME SUSPECT

20:39.770 --> 20:40.862
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.595
- THAT'S JUST THE THING.
IT'S NOT.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.767
GUS AND I ARE ON
TO SEVERAL REAL SUSPECT S.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.835
HUMAN PERSONS
THAT HAD GOOD REASONS

20:46.870 --> 20:47.905
FOR WANTING THAT TRAINER DEAD.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.931
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IF YOU GO TO PRISON, SHAWN,

20:49.980 --> 20:51.572
I WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU.

20:51.610 --> 20:52.770
- YOU WON'T HAVE TO.
I'LL ESCAPE.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.641
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.944
AND BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT CALL,

20:56.980 --> 20:59.016
WILL YOU WAIT
EIGHT MORE SECONDS?

20:59.050 --> 21:03.419
NOW, JULES, PLEASE,

21:03.460 --> 21:05.928
LOOK AT THAT POLAR BEAR.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.655
LOOK AT IT
RIGHT IN THE EYE.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.966
YOU TELL ME
THAT IT'S A MURDERER.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.749
[gunshot]

21:35.860 --> 21:38.021
- NICE SHOT.

21:51.410 --> 21:55.403
- I'M HERE TO SEE MY CLIENT.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.846
- THIS BEAR IS SCHEDULED
TO BE EXECUTED, SHAWN.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.074
IT'S LIKE IT'S ON DEATH ROW.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.008
- WHICH MAKES ME SUSAN SARANDON,

22:05.050 --> 22:06.381
YOU ROBERT PROSKY,

22:06.420 --> 22:07.785
AND THE BEAR SEAN PENN.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.118
NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT THE BEAR
PLAYING HARVEY MILK.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.479
- I WOULD WATCH THAT MOVIE.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.758
- IT WOULD BE
A VERY DIFFERENT FILM

22:12.790 --> 22:16.499
FROM THE ORIGINAL, BUT I THINK
IT'D BE PRETTY EMOTIONAL STILL.

22:16.530 --> 22:17.997
- WHERE DID YOU EVEN--

22:18.030 --> 22:19.122
- I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.

22:19.170 --> 22:20.899
I CAME RIGHT AWAY.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.862
- SO YOU REALLY DO CARE
FOR THIS BEAR, HUH?

22:22.900 --> 22:26.438
- [weeps]

22:26.470 --> 22:28.131
- PLEASE DON'T.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.102
PLEASE DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE--
AS A FAVOR...

22:30.140 --> 22:33.473
[sighs]

22:33.520 --> 22:35.670
I'M THE CREAM
IN A CRYING SANDWICH.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.609
- I CARE SO MUCH

22:38.650 --> 22:39.582
ABOUT ALL TH ESE CREATURES.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.111
I WOULD NEVER RISK THIS BEAR
BEING PUT DOWN

22:42.160 --> 22:43.559
JUST TO CLOSE THE ZOO.

22:43.590 --> 22:44.852
- HEY, MAN,
WE MAY HAVE JUMPED THE GUN

22:44.890 --> 22:47.029
ACCUSING YOU
OF KILLING THE TRAINER.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.823
SORRY.
- THAT'S COOL, MAN.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.920
ACTUALLY, NO, THAT'S NOT COOL.
THAT'S NOT COOL.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.097
WHO WOULD BE COOL WITH THAT?
THAT'S HOMICIDE.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.631
- HEY, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

22:56.670 --> 22:57.967
WE HAVE A NEW SUSPECT.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.466
- REALLY?

22:59.510 --> 23:01.774
WHO IS IT?
- ALL RIGHT, SPOILER ALERT.

23:01.810 --> 23:05.507
C. LEE BANTING,
THE ZOO DIRECTOR.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.177
DUDE, YOU WERE TOTALLY RIGHT
ABOUT ZOOS.

23:07.210 --> 23:08.973
THE ANIMALS SPOKE TO ME, MAN.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.715
A DEPRESSED LEMUR TOLD ME

23:10.750 --> 23:13.412
ABOUT AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT
BANTING TOOK OUT ON THE BEAR.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.609
- SHAWN.
- YEAH?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.548
- I LOOKED INTO THAT.

23:16.590 --> 23:18.478
THEY ONLY GET MONEY
IF THE BEAR DIES ACCIDENTALLY.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.498
THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING
IF THE BEAR IS EUTHANIZED

23:20.530 --> 23:21.895
FOR KILLING SOMEONE.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.488
- HMM.

23:23.530 --> 23:24.861
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG BUZZ KILL.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.492
IT'S THE ONLY THEORY
WE REALLY HAD.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.862
- THIS IS SO IRONIC.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.460
I MEAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

23:31.510 --> 23:33.501
OF THIS AMAZING CREATURE,
AND LOOK AT IT.

23:33.540 --> 23:34.905
IT'S RELYING ON YOU AND I
TO SAVE IT, SHAWN.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.168
- WE FAILED, I GUESS.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.747
- NO.
NO.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.873
TAKE THAT COLLAR OFF OF HER.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.478
IF SHE'S GONNA DIE,

23:42.520 --> 23:44.408
THEN LET HER LEAVE THIS WORLD
THE WAY SHE CAME IN.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.951
- GUS.
- WHAT?

23:47.990 --> 23:49.457
- IT'S NOT A REGULAR COLLAR,
MAN.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.526
LOOK AT IT.
- THAT'S A HEART MONITOR.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.458
SEE, SHE'S GOT
A SLIGHT HEART MURMUR.

23:52.490 --> 23:53.752
THEY LIKE TO MONITOR

23:53.800 --> 23:55.597
HER VITAL SIGNS
AT ALL TIMES.

23:55.630 --> 23:58.997
- WHOA, WHERE--WHERE--WHERE--
WHERE DO THESE RESULTS GO?

23:59.030 --> 24:02.830
- THEY'RE TRANSMITTED WIRELESSLY
TO SOME NEARBY COMPUTER.

24:02.870 --> 24:07.034
PROBABLY IT'S RIGHT HERE
AT THE ZOO.

24:08.810 --> 24:11.244
- I THINK I KNOW A WAY
TO SAVE THIS BEAR.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.840
WE NEED TO GET THAT INFO
AND GET TO THE PERSON

24:13.880 --> 24:15.916
WHO CAN GRANT US
A STAY OF EXECUTION.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.508
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,

24:17.550 --> 24:19.609
THIS IS CODY BLAIR,
VENTURA COUNTY DIRECTOR

24:19.650 --> 24:20.912
OF ANIMAL CONTROL.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.712
YOU BETTER HAVE
SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL FOR HIM.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.988
HE'S TRAVELED A LONG WAY
FOR THIS.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.818
- THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MR. BLAIR.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.623
PLEASE, SIR.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.094
LET ME START BY SAYING THAT
THIS IS A HUGE HONOR FOR ME.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.199
- CUT THE CRAP, SON.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.198
I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ASKING

24:35.240 --> 24:37.629
FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION,
AS YOU PUT IT,

24:37.670 --> 24:38.830
FOR A POLAR BEAR.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.735
THIS IS HIGHLY UNORTHODOX.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.532
- I CAN ASSURE YOU
YOU WILL NOT FEEL

24:42.580 --> 24:43.877
THAT WAY
AFTER I PROVE TO YOU

24:43.910 --> 24:46.674
THAT THIS BEAR
DID NOT KILL ITS TRAINER.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.177
YOU CAN ENTER THAT
ONTO THE RECORD.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.642
- SPENCER,
THIS ISN'T A COURTROOM.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.079
THERE ARE NO RECORDS.
- PERMISSION TO TREAT

24:51.120 --> 24:52.144
THIS MAN AS A HOSTILE WITNESS?

24:52.190 --> 24:53.612
- NO.
- QUICK SIDEBAR?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.218
- ABSOLUTELY NO.
- SHOULD WE POLL THE JURY?

24:55.260 --> 24:57.216
- NEGATIVE.
- MAY I TRY ON YOUR ROBE, JUDGE?

24:57.260 --> 24:58.227
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.284
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.298
I HAVE TESTIMONY
FROM A KEY WITNESS

25:01.330 --> 25:03.150
IN THE FORM
OF VIDEO FOOTAGE

25:03.200 --> 25:04.224
IF YOU WOULD JUST INDULGE ME

25:04.270 --> 25:05.362
FOR A FEW MORE MOMENTS.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.860
THIS FOOTAGE, ACTUALLY, COURTESY
OF MISS LAUREN LASSITER.

25:11.070 --> 25:13.163
- YOU'RE HELPING HIM NOW?

25:13.210 --> 25:14.302
- HERE WE GO.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.604
- OH, NO, NO,
I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.540
THOUGH THE RESULTS
WERE PREVIOUSLY INCONCLUSIVE,

25:18.580 --> 25:20.639
I CAN NOW ESTABLISH
TIME OF DEATH

25:20.680 --> 25:25.140
OF THE TRAINER TO BE
BETWEEN 11:30 PM. AND 3:30 AM.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.543
- WHY IS THIS RELEVANT?

25:26.590 --> 25:29.218
- I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU ASKED.

25:29.260 --> 25:31.558
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT

25:31.590 --> 25:35.890
THESE PAPERS
AS EXHIBIT "A".

25:35.930 --> 25:37.727
- NO EXHIBITS HERE.
STOP SAYING THAT.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.567
WHAT ARE THEY?

25:39.600 --> 25:42.637
- THOSE ARE EKG READOUTS
OF THE BEAR'S VITALS.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.604
- WHAT DO THEY SAY,
MR. SPENCER?

25:44.640 --> 25:46.062
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU, SIR.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.998
A BUNCH OF SQUIGGLY LINES
TO ME.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.271
BUT, BUT...

25:51.310 --> 25:52.971
I HAVE AN EXPERT WITNESS.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.078
[sliding chair]

25:56.750 --> 25:58.741
I PRESENT GUSJAY GUPTA.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.054
- WHAT MAKES HIM AN EXPERT?

26:01.090 --> 26:02.717
- I WORK
IN THE MEDICAL FIELD.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.022
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR?

26:04.060 --> 26:06.255
- I GO TO GUSJAY
FOR ALL MY MEDICAL NEEDS

26:06.290 --> 26:07.359
AND PROCEDURES.

26:07.390 --> 26:09.199
HE REMOVED
BOTH OF MY APPENDIXES.

26:09.230 --> 26:10.663
NOW TELL US

26:10.700 --> 26:12.327
WHAT THE RESULTS ARE
FROM THE HOURS

26:12.370 --> 26:14.861
OF 11:30 PM.
TO 3:30 AM.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.969
ON THE NIGHT
OF THE MURDER.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.638
- IT IS A SLEEPING HEART RATE.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.865
INACT IVE.
- WHAT? INACT IVE?

26:19.910 --> 26:21.332
YOU MEAN IT IS NOT
THE HEART RATE

26:21.380 --> 26:23.974
OF A MAMMAL MURDERING
ITS LIFELONG CARETAKER?

26:26.650 --> 26:28.641
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
THE DEFENSE RESTS.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.772
WHOO!
LITERALLY.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.640
I'M EXHAUSTED.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.386
SHOULD WE ALL NAP?
- LAUREN?

26:34.420 --> 26:36.854
- WELL, MR. SPENCER,

26:36.890 --> 26:40.929
I AM INCLINED TO GRANT YOU
YOUR STAY OF EXECUTION.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.927
LOOK, NOW I'M SAYING IT.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.325
BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.363
IF YOU DON'T COME UP
WITH CONCRETE EVIDENCE

26:46.400 --> 26:50.029
OF ANOTHER SUSPECT
WITHIN 12 HOURS, I WILL PROCEED

26:50.070 --> 26:52.265
WITH THE EUTHANIZATION
OF THIS BEAR.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.631
- UNDERSTOOD.
- SWEET.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.102
- WE DID IT.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.676
- SO STRONG.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.644
- SO I COME OVER HERE
TO THE EVIDENCE CAGE--

27:03.690 --> 27:06.011
HELLO, FRANKLIN.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.018
I TAKE OUT ONE OF THESE.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.325
AN E.R.F.,
EVIDENCE REQUISITION FORM.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.657
NOT THE BLUE ONE.
THE BEIGE ONE.

27:12.690 --> 27:14.226
THE BLUE ONE'S
FOR OUT-OF-STATE--

27:14.260 --> 27:16.091
- I'M SORRY. CUT.
- CUT?

27:16.130 --> 27:17.119
YOU CAN'T SAY CUT.
THIS IS HAPPENING NOW.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.367
THIS IS REAL LIFE.
COME ON. LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.368
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS IS A BIT DRY.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.039
- DRY?

27:24.070 --> 27:26.265
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE DIRECTING ME NOW.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.232
- DO YOU ALWAYS DISCOUNT A LEAD

27:28.280 --> 27:29.372
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME UP
WITH IT?

27:29.410 --> 27:30.968
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:31.010 --> 27:32.739
- I MEAN, LOOK AT SHAWN AND GUS.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.419
MAYBE THEIR METHODS ARE ODD,
PERHAPS EVEN DISTURBING,

27:35.450 --> 27:38.681
BUT THEY'RE NOT ABOUT OBJECTS
AND PAPERS.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.086
THEY'RE ABOUT PEOPLE
AND EMOTIONS.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.815
AND RIGHT NOW
THEY ARE AT THE TRAINER'S HOUSE,

27:42.860 --> 27:44.327
PROBABLY SENSING SOMETHING,

27:44.360 --> 27:45.827
AND YOU JUST DISMISS IT.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.920
- HERE YOU GO.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.292
- OKAY.
MAYBE THIS IS A LITTLE DRIER

27:54.340 --> 27:55.796
THAN YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE,

27:55.840 --> 27:58.434
AND MAYBE MY LIFE
ISN'T AS EXCITING,

27:58.470 --> 28:02.304
BUT I CAN SOLVE THIS CASE.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.376
EVERYTHING I NEED TO DO IT
IS RIGHT HERE

28:04.410 --> 28:05.399
IN THIS BOX.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.202
- THAT BOX?

28:07.250 --> 28:11.118
- I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.243
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.315
I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.
YOU NEED ACTION.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.282
AND YOU NEED MOVEMENT.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.457
WATCH THIS.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.355
I TAKE THE BOX,

28:20.390 --> 28:21.493
AND I GO BACK TO MY DESK,

28:21.530 --> 28:23.350
WHERE I METICULOUSLY GO
THROUGH EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE

28:23.400 --> 28:24.958
WE HAVE,
EVERY FIBER,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.399
EVERY FINGERPRINT,

28:26.430 --> 28:28.762
EVERY PHOTOGRAPH, EVERYTHING
COLLECTED FROM THE TRASH.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.267
AND THEN I WILL FIND
THE ANSWER.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.460
AND IF I DON'T FIND THE ANSWER,

28:31.510 --> 28:35.879
I WILL LOOK AGAIN, BECAUSE
THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS IN THE BOX.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.001
GOT IT.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.361
- NOTHING LIKE THIS
EVER HAPPENS AROUND HERE.

29:06.410 --> 29:07.399
NOT ON THIS BLOCK ANYWAY.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.329
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MURDER.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.348
- I HAVE A QUESTION.
WHEN YOU FIRST MOVED

29:12.380 --> 29:14.314
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
WERE YOU HARASSED A LOT

29:14.350 --> 29:15.419
ON ACCOUNT OF BEING
SO FAMOUS?

29:15.450 --> 29:18.180
- WHAT?
- OH, YOU'RE NOT SETH ROGEN?

29:18.220 --> 29:19.847
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.084
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO MIGHT
HAVE HAD IT OUT FOR HIM?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.417
- GOSH, I DIDN'T KNOW HIM
ALL THAT WELL.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.428
I DON'T THINK
HE HAD ANY ENEMIES.

29:24.460 --> 29:27.429
UM, WELL,
THIS IS A BIT OF A REACH,

29:27.460 --> 29:30.918
BUT DID YOU KNOW
HE HAD A FIANCEE?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.426
- SURE. WE MET HER
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.938
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO SPEAK OUT OF TURN

29:34.970 --> 29:37.393
OR BE UN-NEIGHBORLY,

29:37.440 --> 29:38.805
BUT OUR HOUSES
ARE KIND OF CLOSE TOGETHER,

29:38.840 --> 29:40.137
AND I WOULD HEAR THEM ARGUE.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.172
- WELL, WHO DOESN'T ARGUE?
- ME.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.472
I HAVE A POLICY.

29:43.510 --> 29:45.000
I NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.439
- IT GOT HEATED.
- HOW HEATED?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.175
- PRETTY HEATED. ESPECIALLY
THE NIGHT OF HIS DEATH.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.312
THE COPS ASKED ME,

29:50.350 --> 29:51.146
BUT I DIDN'T WANT

29:51.190 --> 29:52.418
TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ANYONE,
SO...

29:52.450 --> 29:53.485
- IT'S TIME TO MAKE TROUBLE.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.283
SLOPPY TROUBLE.
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.959
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE,
UM...

29:57.990 --> 29:59.389
"WHEN ARE YOU GONNA END IT
WITH HER?

29:59.430 --> 30:01.193
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS EMBARRASSES ME?"

30:01.230 --> 30:01.992
STUFF LIKE THAT.

30:02.030 --> 30:05.420
I-I THINK
HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.290
- DID YOU EVER SEE THE WOMAN
COME OUT THE HOUSE

30:07.330 --> 30:08.433
OR ID. A CAR?

30:08.470 --> 30:10.199
- HE LOVED THAT BEAR.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.299
HE DEVOTED HIS WHOLE LIFE
TO IT.

30:12.340 --> 30:16.231
- LAUREN, I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET SOME B-ROLL.

30:17.410 --> 30:18.240
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE PICTURE

30:18.280 --> 30:20.100
OF THE FIANCEE
IN THE TRAINER'S HOUSE.

30:20.150 --> 30:21.845
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
A LITTLE BIT ODD?

30:21.880 --> 30:23.108
- MM-HMM.
- HE WAS DEFINITELY HAVING

30:23.150 --> 30:24.412
AN AFFAIR, BUT THE WOMAN
WAS VERY, VERY LARGE

30:24.450 --> 30:26.145
AND VERY, VERY HEAW.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.919
- HE WAS A CHUBBY CHASER?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.484
- WHAT?
SERIOUSLY?

30:29.520 --> 30:32.080
THE OTHER WOMAN
WAS THE POLAR BEAR.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.451
- OH.
- YEAH, THE FIANCEE WAS JEALOUS

30:34.500 --> 30:35.558
OF THE BEAR.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.467
SHE KNEW HE WAS NEVER GONNA GIVE
THE BEAR UP FOR HER.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.367
THE NIGHT IT GOT HEATED?

30:41.400 --> 30:44.369
WE NEED TO GET
TO THAT FIANCEE'S HOUSE.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.329
ZACK AND MIRI
MAKE A PORNO?

30:48.380 --> 30:49.574
GOOD-BYE, SETH.

30:53.080 --> 30:57.312
[buzzing]

30:57.350 --> 30:58.510
- WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN THIS HAPPENS?

30:58.550 --> 31:01.485
- WELL, THE GOAL
IS TO GET BUZZED IN, RIGHT?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.080
SO I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO USE
THE PIZZA DELIVERY ROUTINE.

31:04.130 --> 31:07.258
GUS HAS HAD MUCH MORE SUCCESS
WITH STRIPPER-GRAMS.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.190
HIS STAGE NAME
IS ORIGINAL G-STRING,

31:09.230 --> 31:12.324
A.K.A. CROWD-PLEAZAH.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.361
YOU'RE UP, STRING.
DO YOUR THING.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.367
- WHAT?

31:15.400 --> 31:16.537
- COME ON, SMACK IT.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.037
- I'M NOT SMACKING ANYTHING,
SHAWN.

31:18.070 --> 31:19.401
- WILL YOU FLIP IT?
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

31:19.440 --> 31:20.976
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
YOU BETTER--

31:21.010 --> 31:22.307
YOU BETTER RUB IT DOWN
OR SOMETHING.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.399
YOU'VE GOT AN AUDIENCE.
[door buzzes]

31:28.420 --> 31:32.083
- WELL, LULU, THIS IS WHAT WE
IN THE BUSINESS

31:32.120 --> 31:36.113
LIKE TO CALL
A COLLAR.

31:37.290 --> 31:39.326
BEAT YOU TO IT, BOYS.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.294
- [softly] I HAVE TO GO.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.262
- I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.930
- YOU KNOW, A LESSER COP
MIGHT HAVE LOOKED

31:54.980 --> 31:56.709
AT A SHREDDED SHIRT
FOUND IN THE TRASH

31:56.740 --> 31:58.048
AT THE TRAINER'S HOUSE
WITH TRACES OF BLOOD ON IT

31:58.080 --> 31:59.547
AND THOUGHT,
"NO BIG DEAL."

31:59.580 --> 32:02.378
THE GUY JUST PROBABLY CUT
HIMSELF SHAVING, THREW IT OUT.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.638
BUT I'M NOT YOUR AVERAGE COP.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.419
ARE YOU SNIFFING MY SISTER?

32:08.220 --> 32:11.986
SEE, I LOOKED AT THE LABEL
ON THE SHIRT.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.998
SMALL.
WASN'T HIS.

32:14.030 --> 32:14.849
IT WAS HERS.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.151
I SENT IT OUT,
HAD THE BLOOD ANALYZED,

32:16.200 --> 32:17.656
AND, LO AND BEHOLD,

32:17.700 --> 32:20.396
DIRECT MATCH
TO OUR VICTIM'S BLOOD TYPE.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.068
- IMPRESSIVE.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.067
- SURE IT IS.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.965
BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE

32:25.010 --> 32:27.308
IS GETTING A CONFESSION
OUT OF HER.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.639
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A MURDERER CRUMBLE?

32:30.680 --> 32:34.013
- NO, BUTI HAVE SEEN MANY
A COOKIE DO THAT VERY THING.

32:34.050 --> 32:36.644
AFTER ALL, IT IS THEIR WAY.

32:36.680 --> 32:41.083
- YOU FOUGHT
WITH YOUR INTENDED

32:41.120 --> 32:43.088
THE NIGHT OF HIS DEATH,
DIDN'T YOU, MS. KRAEMER?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.259
- WE ARGUED, YES.

32:45.290 --> 32:46.257
- I'M GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.484
I THINK YOU KILLED

32:47.530 --> 32:50.988
YOUR FIANCE--FIANCE--FI--

32:51.030 --> 32:53.498
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.088
I THINK YOU MURDERED
YOUR LOVER.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.493
LOVER? EW.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.768
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
I CAN DO IT BETTER.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.506
JUST START OVER AG--

32:59.540 --> 33:01.076
LET ME KNOW
WHEN I'M OUT OF FRAME, OKAY?

33:01.110 --> 33:02.771
AM I GOOD HERE?

33:02.810 --> 33:05.347
O'HARA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

33:05.380 --> 33:08.508
- I'M NOT SURE.

33:08.550 --> 33:11.348
- OKAY, START AGAIN.
READY?

33:11.390 --> 33:14.655
AND...
YOU KILLED THE TRAINER,

33:14.690 --> 33:17.011
THEN YOU DRAGGED HIS BODY
INTO THE CAR

33:17.060 --> 33:19.381
AND DISPOSED OF IT
IN THE POLAR BEAR HABITAT.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.250
THEN YOU HASTILY RETURNED
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME

33:21.300 --> 33:22.653
AND DISPOSED OF THAT SHIRT,

33:22.700 --> 33:25.294
BUT YOU DIDN'T NOTICE THE TRACES
OF BLOOD ON IT, DID YOU?

33:25.330 --> 33:28.299
WELL, I DID.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.035
- WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO?
KISS HER?

33:30.070 --> 33:32.038
- SHE DRAGGED HIM?

33:32.070 --> 33:33.503
- THAT SMALL PERSON
DRAGGED SOMEBODY?

33:33.540 --> 33:35.076
- NO WAY.

33:35.110 --> 33:38.375
QUESTION FROM THE VIEWING ROOM:
MISS KRAEMER,

33:38.410 --> 33:39.479
WHAT IS YOUR BLOOD TYPE?

33:39.510 --> 33:40.738
- O NEGATIVE.

33:40.780 --> 33:46.685
- AND WHAT IS THE BLOOD TYPE
OF THE VICTIM?

33:46.720 --> 33:49.609
- O NEGATIVE.
- OH, IS IT?

33:51.430 --> 33:53.227
LASSIE, ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT THE BLOOD

33:53.260 --> 33:54.727
ON MISS KRAEMER'S SHIRT
IS HER OWN?

33:54.760 --> 33:56.819
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
SPENCER, I KNOW

33:56.860 --> 33:59.067
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO--
[tapplng]

33:59.100 --> 34:01.762
I AM GONNA SEND
THAT SHIRT OUT,

34:01.800 --> 34:03.688
HAVE THE DNA ANALYZED,

34:03.740 --> 34:05.332
AND PROVE THAT IT WAS
THE TRAINER'S BLOOD.

34:06.510 --> 34:09.308
- OW!

34:09.340 --> 34:11.672
- YOU'RE MAKING FACES AT ME
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

34:11.710 --> 34:12.540
- NO NEED FOR THAT.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.468
MISS KRAEMER,
DO YOU GARDEN BY CHANCE?

34:14.520 --> 34:15.817
-IDO.

34:15.850 --> 34:17.715
ROSES.
AT THE HOUSE.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.115
- THAT SOUNDS NICE.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.481
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND
AS TO ROLL UP

34:20.520 --> 34:23.455
YOUR RIGHT SLEEVE, PLEASE?

34:23.490 --> 34:24.650
OOH.
LOOK AT THAT.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.749
LASSIE, IF YOU LINE UP
THE SLEEVE

34:26.790 --> 34:29.122
WITH MISS KRAEMER'S ARM,
I THINK YOU WILL FIND

34:29.160 --> 34:30.718
THAT THE BLOOD SPOTS
MATCH PERFECT LY.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.794
- CRAP.
- IT'S OKAY, LASSIE.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.705
I'VE GOT YOUR BOX OF TOYS
IN HERE.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.765
YOU CAN TRY AGAIN.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.277
MAYBE YOU WANT TO PIN THE MURDER
ON THIS STAPLER HERE.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.801
- CAN YOU JUST STOP,
YOU KNOW?

34:46.880 --> 34:48.768
- NOW, LAUREN,
PLEASE REMEMBER,

34:48.820 --> 34:50.845
IF ANYONE EVER MAKES A MOVIE

34:50.880 --> 34:52.381
OUT OF YOUR DOCUMENTARY,

34:52.420 --> 34:55.412
I WOULD LIKE TO BE PLAYED
BY CILLIAN MURPHY,

34:55.460 --> 34:58.156
BECAUSE IT'S UNEXPECT ED.
IT'S ODD.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.124
PEOPLE WILL TALK.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.493
OBVIOUSLY, STONEY JACKSON
WILL PLAY GUS.

35:03.530 --> 35:06.294
FWUSH FINKEL
WILL PLAY MY FATHER.

35:06.330 --> 35:07.820
NOW HE'S PROBABLY GONNA WANT
TO DO A LISP,

35:07.870 --> 35:10.566
BUT...
THAT ACTUALLY FEELS RIGHT TO ME.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.465
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:12.510 --> 35:14.808
- I AM ERASING ALL THE FOOTAGE
OF MY BROTHER

35:14.840 --> 35:15.909
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.908
IT'S JUST EMBARRASSING.
- WHAT?

35:17.940 --> 35:19.669
NO.

35:19.710 --> 35:23.476
OH, LOOK HOW ADORABLE LASSIE IS
AT THAT SIZE.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.738
- HE'S TINY.
- I JUST WANT TO PICK HIM UP.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.746
JUST PICK HIM UP
AND PUT HIM IN MY BREAST POCKET.

35:27.790 --> 35:28.814
- LASSIE ON YOUR BREAST.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.351
- RIGHT ON MY BREAST.
JUST KEEP HIM RIGHT HERE.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.722
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.251
THIS IS NOT THE CARLTON
THAT I KNOW.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.790
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID,

35:37.830 --> 35:39.366
I ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO HIM.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.595
HE WAS
LIKE THIS MYTHICAL FIGURE,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.859
BUT WATCHING HIM
THROUGH MY LENS

35:44.910 --> 35:46.309
AND SEEING YOU GUYS
ONE-UP HIM,

35:46.340 --> 35:49.377
I REALIZED HE ISN'T MYTHICAL
AT ALL, IS HE?

35:49.410 --> 35:52.800
HE'S JUST FOOLISH.

35:52.850 --> 35:56.741
- WELL, I MEAN,
HE'S NOT--HE'S NOT ALWAYS...

35:58.320 --> 35:59.719
WHOA, WHOA, STOP RIGHT THERE,
LAUREN.

36:05.390 --> 36:06.687
WILL YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A SECOND?

36:06.730 --> 36:07.856
GUS, COME WITH ME.

36:07.890 --> 36:10.757
- I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND.
- NO, NO, I NEED YOU NOW.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.994
- I SAID I'LL BE THERE
IN A SECOND.

36:12.030 --> 36:14.260
- I JUST HAD A BREAKTHROUGH.
- JUST GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES.

36:14.300 --> 36:15.437
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

36:15.470 --> 36:18.234
[overlapping arguing]

36:19.340 --> 36:21.274
- I DON'T CARE.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.619
- JUST WHAT I THOUGHT.

36:37.660 --> 36:42.324
- THANK YOU
FOR BEING HERE FOR ME.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.896
YOU'RE VERY KIND.

36:43.930 --> 36:46.763
- OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

36:57.410 --> 37:00.800
- WOW.
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

37:00.850 --> 37:04.581
- THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.781
- YOU'RE--YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

37:06.820 --> 37:07.844
- THANK YOU.

37:07.890 --> 37:10.859
- ARE YOU DATING ANYONE?

37:10.890 --> 37:13.984
- [yelp5]

37:14.030 --> 37:15.622
- LAUREN, GOOD NEWS!

37:15.660 --> 37:17.651
I JUST HAD A MAJOR PSYCHIC VIBE.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.292
GATHER EVERYONE,
INCLUDING YOUR BROTHER.

37:19.330 --> 37:21.389
WE'RE GOING
TO THE TRAINER'S HOUSE.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.829
- OKAY.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.864
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING
VERY STRONG.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.730
RIGHT HERE.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.305
YES.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.408
RIGHT IN HERE.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.577
RIGHT ALONG HERE.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.612
THIS FENCE...

37:37.650 --> 37:38.719
WAS MOVED.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.741
I'M ALSO GETTING
JUDY SHEINDLIN.

37:40.790 --> 37:45.386
IT WAS A CASE, SMALL,
AND THEN...

37:45.430 --> 37:47.386
EVERYTHING GETS FUZZY.

37:47.430 --> 37:50.399
CASE, JUDGE JUDY,

37:50.430 --> 37:52.364
I'M SORRY, LINE.
LINE, PLEASE.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.492
- WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH HIM?

37:53.530 --> 37:54.861
- IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER
YOUR LINES.

37:54.900 --> 37:55.889
- NOBODY HAS ANY LINES.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.660
- WHAT, NOBODY'S ON BOOK?
LAUREN?

37:59.710 --> 38:01.837
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.
THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO ME.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.734
I SWEAR.

38:03.780 --> 38:04.769
ALL RIGHT, FENCE,

38:04.810 --> 38:06.448
WHAT DO WE KNOW?
FENCE, CASE.

38:06.480 --> 38:10.712
THERE WAS A CASE.
THE FENCE WAS PART OF THE CASE.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.388
NO ONE REMEMBERS THIS?
- HOLY CRAP.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.978
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.351
I SOLVED IT.
- YOU DID?

38:15.390 --> 38:16.812
- YEAH, IT'S ALL
IN THE EVIDENCE.

38:16.860 --> 38:17.986
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE,
SPENCER.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.681
- THANKS, LASSIE. I DON'T--

38:19.730 --> 38:21.755
- THANK YOU, BUDDY.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.988
READY?

38:26.030 --> 38:28.828
[sniffs, then clears throat]

38:28.870 --> 38:30.758
SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT ANIMALS--

38:30.800 --> 38:33.598
THEY'RE FILTHY,
THEY'RE INFERIOR TO MAN--

38:33.640 --> 38:36.734
BUT THE ONE THING THEY HAVE
OVER THE HUMAN SPECIES--

38:36.780 --> 38:38.975
ANIMALS ARE NOT PETTY.

38:39.010 --> 38:40.671
HUMANS, ON THE OTHER HAND,

38:40.710 --> 38:42.814
WELL,
WE JUST CAN'T HELP OURSELVES.

38:42.850 --> 38:46.741
THIS WHOLE CASE CAME DOWN
TO A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED DISPUTE

38:46.790 --> 38:49.088
BETWEEN TWO NEIGHBORS.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.350
A SMALL CLAIMS CASE WAS FILED
AGAINST JASPER ZANE

38:51.390 --> 38:53.426
BY YOU,
RITCH RENAUD.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.791
PSST.

38:54.830 --> 38:55.626
IT WAS THE TOP DOCUMENT

38:55.660 --> 38:58.367
IN MY NEATLY-STACKED BOX
OF EVIDENCE.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.298
MUST HAVE PUT IT THERE
SUBCONSCIOUSLY.

38:59.330 --> 39:01.890
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED HERE, RITCH.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.135
YOU SUED YOUR NEIGHBOR
OVER YOUR PROPERTY LINE,

39:04.170 --> 39:08.004
DIVIDED BY THIS FENCE,
WHICH USED TO BE HERE

39:08.040 --> 39:09.905
AND YOU MOVED HERE.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.840
YOU MURDERED YOUR NEIGHBOR

39:11.880 --> 39:13.700
OVER TWO FEET.

39:13.750 --> 39:14.842
YOU'RE AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.142
- LIKE BELUSHI AND AYKROYD.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.772
- YES, IN TRADING PLACES.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.811
- NEIGHBORS.
- I GAVE IT A SHOT.

39:19.850 --> 39:21.386
- KNOW THE FEELING.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.819
- YOU ARGUED THAT NIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:22.860 --> 39:23.918
THINGS GOT HEATED,
OUT OF CONTROL.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.985
YOU CHOKED HIM.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.166
- WITH YOUR OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.690
- UNNECESSARY DETAIL.

39:33.730 --> 39:34.833
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM.

39:34.870 --> 39:35.894
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.430
BUT SUDDENLY
YOU HAD TO COVER IT UP.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.404
SO YOU DROVE HIS BODY
TO THE ZOO,

39:39.440 --> 39:42.079
YOU DUMPED IT IN THE PIT,

39:42.110 --> 39:44.101
AND YOU TRIED TO PIN IT
ON THE POLAR BEAR.

39:44.140 --> 39:47.849
YOU, SIR, DISGUST ME.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.575
AND YOU'RE THE WORST NEIGHBOR
IN AMERICA.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.818
DETECTIVE O'HARA,

39:52.850 --> 39:54.078
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DO THE HONORS?

39:54.120 --> 39:56.782
- OKAY.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.929
OH.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.825
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES,
FORGET IT.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.695
- VERY IMPRESSIVE,
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.799
- PLEASE.
CALL ME CARLTON.

40:10.840 --> 40:15.800
- I WILL.
I WAS JUST DOING A BIT.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.474
- I KNOW WHAT A BIT IS.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.818
- LASSIE,

40:23.850 --> 40:24.817
THANKS FOR HAVING MY BACK, MAN.

40:24.850 --> 40:26.841
- OH, HEY,
NO WORRIES.

40:26.890 --> 40:29.484
YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE
EVENTUALLY.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.987
AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT
FOR REALIZING

40:31.020 --> 40:32.681
IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT SOLVING CRIMES.

40:32.730 --> 40:36.154
I MEAN, THESE KIND OF SPEECHES,
THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN SORT

40:36.200 --> 40:37.622
OF DELIVERY
AND GRAVITAS

40:37.660 --> 40:39.696
THAT YOU MAY JUST NOT
BE CAPABLE OF.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.733
THIS IS FOR A MOVIE,
AFTER ALL.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.074
- HE DID GOOD, DIDN'T HE?
- HE DID OKAY.

40:51.110 --> 40:54.876
- OH, COME ON, HE'S GOT
HIS OWN CERTAIN KIND OF CHARM.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.774
- NO, HE REALLY DOESN'T.

40:56.820 --> 40:57.741
- I THINK HE FOUND SOMETHING
OUT THERE.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.179
- I DIDN'T SEE IT.

40:59.220 --> 41:00.482
- THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE YOU WERE BUSY LOOKING

41:00.520 --> 41:02.078
AT HIS SISTER.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.155
WHAT?

41:06.560 --> 41:09.757
- YOU KNOW WHAT, UM,
MAYBE IF YOU JUST DON'T TELL ME

41:09.800 --> 41:11.927
THAT THE CAMERA'S ON,

41:11.970 --> 41:14.564
THEN MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.659
- HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN FRIENDS?

41:16.700 --> 41:17.962
- WOW.
- FOREVER.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.228
SINCE WE WERE BABIES.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.670
- WHEN WE WERE NOT?
- WE POOPED TOGETHER.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.109
- WELL...
- NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

41:23.140 --> 41:26.541
- SHAWN WILL GO BALD.
IT'S GENETICS.

41:26.580 --> 41:27.945
HE DOESN'T REALIZE IT NOW,

41:27.980 --> 41:30.175
BUT IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.949
I JUST PRAY
THAT I'M ALIVE TO SEE IT.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.140
- IT'S ALMOST
LIKE THERE'S A VULCAN--

41:34.190 --> 41:36.158
WE CAN FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

41:36.190 --> 41:37.680
- RIGHT.
- FOR EXAMPLE,

41:37.720 --> 41:39.153
AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE,

41:39.190 --> 41:42.557
WE'RE GONNA JUMP
IN THE BLUEBERRY AND...

41:42.600 --> 41:45.569
- HOW COULD YOU SAY I DIDN'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO YOU AS A KID?

41:45.600 --> 41:47.591
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.234
WHAT OTHER HIGH SCHOOL BOY
WOULD STAY UP

41:49.270 --> 41:50.589
READING TO THEIR LITTLE SISTER?

41:50.640 --> 41:53.632
- UH, YOU READ ME
MY MIRANDA RIGHTS.

41:53.670 --> 41:54.705
- I SET IT UP.

41:54.740 --> 41:56.207
AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE,
WE'RE GONNA JUMP...

41:56.240 --> 41:57.207
- THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE OFF?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.275
- SCRATCH THIS.
FORGET THAT.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.744
- IT'S OFF?

42:00.780 --> 42:03.613
IT'S ON, ISN'T IT?

42:03.650 --> 42:05.208
I CAN SEE THE RED LIGHT.
IT'S ON.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.741
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE GUS AND I
WILL BE IN 50 YEARS.

42:07.790 --> 42:12.159
BUT...
MAYBE IN SPACE.

42:12.190 --> 42:15.227
IF MAN EVER FIGURES OUT
HOW TO TRAVEL THAT FAR.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.751
- MAN DOES TRAVEL IN SPACE.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.598
- [laughs]
HE'S A SWEET KID.

42:20.630 --> 42:21.733
I THINK I'LL KEEP HIM.

42:21.770 --> 42:24.603
- [roars]
