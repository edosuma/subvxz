00:01.318 --> 00:04.253
<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

00:07.158 --> 00:08.524
Suspect at 12:00.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.496
Going in.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.033
Freeze!

00:18.102 --> 00:19.535
Miss, do you have any idea
how fast you were just eating?

00:19.603 --> 00:21.170
I hope not too fast.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.504
What's going on, girls?

00:22.573 --> 00:24.206
I'm going to the police station today

00:24.275 --> 00:25.441
to spend the day with Daniel.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.242
I'm gonna learn how to be a cop.

00:27.311 --> 00:29.778
I know that you have
career day today, honey.

00:29.847 --> 00:31.480
But maybe let your sister

00:31.549 --> 00:32.715
eat her breakfast in peace.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.982
Yes, ma'am.

00:34.051 --> 00:36.151
You have the right
to finish your breakfast.

00:41.559 --> 00:42.991
Morning, Sal.

00:45.429 --> 00:47.096
Sal?

00:47.164 --> 00:48.464
Sal?

00:48.532 --> 00:49.832
- Sal?!
- What?!

00:49.900 --> 00:50.999
Oh...

00:51.068 --> 00:52.301
Uh... Did you sleep here?

00:52.369 --> 00:54.103
No.

00:54.171 --> 00:55.804
I just woke up early,

00:55.873 --> 00:57.506
and because...

00:57.575 --> 01:01.009
of Anika's breakthrough last night,

01:01.078 --> 01:03.178
I decided, take all the faces

01:03.247 --> 01:04.446
I could find in Amsterdam

01:04.515 --> 01:05.814
and put them in the database

01:05.883 --> 01:07.483
of a facial tracking program

01:07.551 --> 01:10.052
and run your composition
drawing over it with

01:10.121 --> 01:13.522
and without the mustache.

01:13.591 --> 01:14.690
Yeah?

01:14.759 --> 01:17.926
So far I haven't gotten any matches.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.962
Still just a fake, nameless policeman.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.864
All right, well,
I mean, we have the mask,

01:21.932 --> 01:23.932
we have the video, we have the face.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.268
I mean, surely that's enough
to prove that Erik's innocent.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.137
Right, I mean, that's enough.

01:28.205 --> 01:29.905
But Daniel's off the case.

01:31.909 --> 01:34.009
Maybe we can just pass it on to Simone.

01:35.446 --> 01:37.312
Guys, breakfast.

01:37.381 --> 01:39.248
All right, coming.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.749
Take your time.

01:43.287 --> 01:46.088
I'm gonna be
the best cop assistant ever.

01:46.157 --> 01:47.723
I thought you said you
wanted to be an astronaut.

01:47.792 --> 01:49.224
And a forest ranger.

01:49.293 --> 01:50.459
And a race car driver.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.027
And a relative.

01:52.096 --> 01:53.195
Sworn guardian of

01:53.264 --> 01:54.863
the "Really Cool Shiny Things" vault.

01:54.932 --> 01:56.532
Yeah, I'm gonna be all those
things when I grow up.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.302
So, a super space police race
ranger relative it is then.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.271
Mm-hmm.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.772
I already know what I wanna be.

02:03.841 --> 02:04.840
Hmm?

02:04.909 --> 02:05.908
I wanna be Kate.

02:05.976 --> 02:07.009
Aw...

02:07.077 --> 02:08.509
Or a mermaid.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.014
Good morning, guys.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.383
Ah, my assistant for the day.

02:15.686 --> 02:16.852
That's me!

02:16.921 --> 02:18.453
Your chariot awaits.

02:18.522 --> 02:20.022
Bye, guys.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.690
- See you later.
- Bye.

02:21.759 --> 02:23.025
You need your jacket, all right?

02:23.093 --> 02:24.059
Yeah.

02:26.163 --> 02:27.462
Daniel.

02:27.531 --> 02:30.632
Uh, I know you're off the case,

02:30.701 --> 02:32.434
but what if we had enough evidence

02:32.503 --> 02:34.002
to prove that Erik's innocent?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.504
Could I give it to you?

02:35.573 --> 02:36.672
I wish I could take it,

02:36.740 --> 02:39.007
but Simon is watching me like a hawk.

02:40.678 --> 02:42.978
I mean, you could come
to the station yourself

02:43.047 --> 02:44.479
and hand it over to him if you like.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.781
In fact, you can all come.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.850
Really? That would be awesome.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.484
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.

02:51.121 --> 02:53.422
This is so awesome.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.523
All right, guys,

02:54.592 --> 02:55.724
can you please put on your seat belts?

02:55.793 --> 02:57.092
Can you turn on the siren?

02:57.161 --> 02:58.193
No, sorry.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.328
But please just put on your...

02:59.396 --> 03:00.829
I can turn on the siren!

03:03.334 --> 03:05.300
No, Anika, that's not
what a siren sounds like.

03:05.369 --> 03:06.368
It's more like...

03:07.771 --> 03:09.705
Uh, no, Sal, I'm an expert. Trust me.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.841
The sirens go like this...

03:12.910 --> 03:14.076
Guys, quiet!

03:16.213 --> 03:18.213
A siren actually sounds like...

03:24.521 --> 03:25.621
Right.

03:25.689 --> 03:27.422
I was told you have evidence

03:27.491 --> 03:28.590
to clear your father's name.

03:28.659 --> 03:29.691
We do.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.693
And this evidence also points

03:31.762 --> 03:32.861
to the real culprit

03:32.930 --> 03:34.263
who supposedly framed your father.

03:34.331 --> 03:36.531
Absolutely.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.668
All right. Let's see this evidence.

03:39.737 --> 03:42.004
All right, so these are pictures

03:42.072 --> 03:43.538
from the actual footage of the robbery.

03:43.607 --> 03:44.640
Right.

03:44.708 --> 03:47.342
Now, this man wore this mask

03:47.411 --> 03:48.844
to make it look like he was Erik.

03:48.913 --> 03:51.013
This man is the real robber

03:51.081 --> 03:52.281
who tried to frame our father.

03:52.349 --> 03:53.615
Does he have a name?

03:53.684 --> 03:54.950
Uh...

03:57.721 --> 04:00.088
Have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.625
Please tell me you did not
take a party mask,

04:03.694 --> 04:04.927
draw a guy with a mustache

04:04.995 --> 04:06.261
and altered some video footage

04:06.330 --> 04:07.729
just to clear your father's name.

04:07.798 --> 04:08.897
Well, he's innocent.

04:08.966 --> 04:09.965
I'm sorry, guys.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.068
I'll tell you what...

04:13.137 --> 04:14.603
you seem like good kids.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.139
Let's have forensics
take a look at it, hmm?

04:18.242 --> 04:20.676
And we'll get back to you.

04:20.744 --> 04:21.843
All right.

04:28.619 --> 04:30.519
Well, that was productive.

04:30.587 --> 04:31.586
I don't know.

04:31.655 --> 04:32.955
Maybe the police will find the guy.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.123
I think we have a better chance
of the thief showing up

04:35.192 --> 04:38.260
at our house with a written confession.

04:38.329 --> 04:40.662
So how's our facial recognition going?

04:42.433 --> 04:44.700
Still no matches.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.736
Wait.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.371
There's a message from Apoll0.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.273
Receiving Apoll0's message.

04:52.576 --> 04:53.709
Who?

04:53.777 --> 04:55.610
You know, the person
who's been helping us.

04:55.679 --> 04:57.879
I am at the patio.

04:57.948 --> 04:59.147
Open the door.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.282
Outside.

05:00.351 --> 05:01.950
Finally get to see who it is.

05:08.659 --> 05:09.992
Down here.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:20.854 --> 05:22.554
Apoll0?

05:22.623 --> 05:23.955
Nice to meet you.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.363
Some of my classmates are
visiting a bakery today

05:31.432 --> 05:32.531
or a dentist.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.565
You know, those type of things.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.600
But that's way too boring for me.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.202
I want an adventure.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.805
And plus, I'd make a really good

05:39.873 --> 05:40.906
police detective one day.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.507
Here you go, Anika.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.444
Hot chocolate for you and coffee for me.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.778
Thank you.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.613
You know, it's not
easy being a good detective.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.049
Aren't you guys supposed to be working?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.185
Yeah, I was just explaining to my sister

05:53.253 --> 05:55.454
- that it's hard to be a good detective.
- Yes.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.090
It's a very important but difficult job.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.925
You gotta stay focused.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.161
And be able to stay super quiet.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.597
And always pay attention.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.833
I've got this.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.234
I'm really good at this.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.936
I always pay attention.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.337
Anika, that's my...

06:19.012 --> 06:20.679
- Ahh!
- Coffee.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.582
What did you do?

06:23.650 --> 06:24.983
I'm sorry, I thought it was my...

06:25.052 --> 06:26.184
Ahh!

06:45.606 --> 06:47.239
Hey, Simon.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.707
Something wrong?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.609
You just threw that evidence away.

06:50.677 --> 06:51.710
I thought you were
taking it to forensics.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.645
Come on, this isn't evidence.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.946
It's a party mask.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.649
A drawing, some fuzzy computer images.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.684
And I told you you were off this case.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.653
You... you can't...

07:01.722 --> 07:04.422
Well, I absolutely can.
And I'll tell you what,

07:04.491 --> 07:06.558
you're working
the supermarket case today.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.426
I... I thought...

07:08.495 --> 07:10.395
Well, you thought wrong.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.998
Your father's case is
open, shut, and done.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.332
Don't let it cloud your judgment,

07:14.401 --> 07:16.301
or you'll be out of here.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.903
Just be happy that your father

07:17.971 --> 07:19.604
can wait for his trial at home.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.488
You okay, partner?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.259
Let's solve the supermarket case

07:41.328 --> 07:43.094
and show this guy who he's dealing with.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.333
So, you're Apoll0?

07:48.402 --> 07:49.835
I am in a secret location,

07:49.903 --> 07:53.705
but it is nice to finally meet
you guys in some form.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.674
Wha... I'd shake your hand,

07:55.742 --> 07:57.442
but you only have wheels.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.078
Yeah, it's nice
to meet you, Apoll0.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.179
We could use all the help we can get

08:01.248 --> 08:02.280
to figure out who this hacker is.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.282
That is why I am here.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.152
I came here because I know
where to find the hacker

08:07.221 --> 08:09.421
that has been spying on you.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.289
Wait, you know where the hacker is?

08:11.358 --> 08:12.557
Sort of.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.160
If you guys drop me off
at a certain place,

08:15.229 --> 08:17.429
I can figure out where he might be.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.930
And what certain place is that?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.800
The classified,
top-secret server room

08:21.869 --> 08:24.069
of the Telecom Company.

08:27.241 --> 08:29.708
This building is where
the Telecom Company

08:29.776 --> 08:31.409
stores all their data traffic.

08:31.478 --> 08:35.246
If I can get inside, I can find
who has been spying on you.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.082
How are we supposed to get you in there?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.385
I have an idea.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.687
I need a cake box.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.959
So, earlier today,

08:48.028 --> 08:49.594
the owner of this supermarket

08:49.663 --> 08:51.563
reported that a lot of money
went missing

08:51.632 --> 08:53.331
from a hidden safe.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.733
We're gonna go in and see

08:54.801 --> 08:56.668
if we can find anything suspicious.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.236
Anika...

08:58.305 --> 09:00.472
this is my first case without Simone,

09:00.540 --> 09:03.341
so please just watch, listen,

09:03.410 --> 09:04.609
and stay by my side, all right?

09:04.678 --> 09:05.877
Got it.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.881
Here, why don't you
take a lot of pictures?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.683
Cool.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.551
No, of the crime scene

09:13.620 --> 09:15.487
and of anything that you think
might look suspicious.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.588
Right.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.689
You ready?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.699
Just drop me
off at the third floor.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.235
- Yep.
- It's like a classic guys' movie.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.603
Let's go.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.917
Can I help you?

09:45.986 --> 09:48.553
Uh, hi.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.956
It's our, um, mom's birthday,

09:51.024 --> 09:52.057
and she works here.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.692
And we wanted to give her this cake.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.193
I'll make sure that she gets it.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.529
No-no-no, um...

09:57.597 --> 10:00.065
We wanted to give it to her in person.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.667
Uh... all right.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.169
You guys can go up.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.271
But make it quick. What floor?

10:06.340 --> 10:07.639
Oh, the third floor.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.609
But the third floor is
restricted access.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.845
Well, what he means is,

10:13.914 --> 10:15.847
she works on the fourth floor now

10:15.916 --> 10:17.615
and she used to work on the third floor.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.386
All right.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.221
Fourth floor it is.

10:24.691 --> 10:25.991
Hold on.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.592
Someone will escort you.

10:36.253 --> 10:37.585
So the safe is always locked

10:37.654 --> 10:39.120
with a timer and a number code.

10:39.189 --> 10:40.355
But this morning, when I came in,

10:40.424 --> 10:42.557
the safe was open
and the money was missing.

10:42.626 --> 10:44.192
And what time was that?

10:44.261 --> 10:47.162
Uh, around 8:00, I guess.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.030
The money must have been
stolen somewhere

10:49.099 --> 10:51.132
between 7:00 and 7:30...

10:51.201 --> 10:53.768
...because at that time,
the alarm system was turned off.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.337
But I was in the front of the store,

10:55.405 --> 10:56.671
and they must have
come in through the back.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.239
'Cause, look, it's broken.

10:58.308 --> 11:00.108
Same with the security camera.

11:00.177 --> 11:01.843
You take your time here, okay?

11:01.912 --> 11:04.179
Okay, thanks.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.281
Oh, one more thing.

11:06.350 --> 11:08.083
I found this glove.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.652
Thanks. This might be useful.

11:16.793 --> 11:18.727
Anika, do you have
the evidence bag I gave you?

11:18.795 --> 11:19.828
Mm-hmm.

11:35.512 --> 11:37.412
Fourth floor.

11:37.481 --> 11:38.680
Here we go.

11:44.654 --> 11:46.154
What flavor is that cake?

11:46.223 --> 11:47.288
Three.

11:47.357 --> 11:49.524
Uh, it's a three-flavored cake.

11:49.593 --> 11:52.560
Uh, red velvet, vanilla, red velvet.

12:04.007 --> 12:05.006
Why did you do that?

12:05.075 --> 12:06.408
Um, it was stuck.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.042
Yeah, but I think I fixed it.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.080
Oh, did you hear that?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.449
- What?
- Sounded like a cable snapping.

12:14.518 --> 12:16.284
Yeah, I think it was over there.

12:19.222 --> 12:20.288
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.400
Red hair in the bag.

12:32.469 --> 12:35.003
Now, let's ask the caf� owner
next door some questions.

12:38.141 --> 12:39.607
I don't think I can help you.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.142
We're getting ready for the brunch rush.

12:41.211 --> 12:44.279
Oh, we do a great brunch.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.816
Scrambled eggs, coffee,
freshly baked rolls.

12:47.884 --> 12:50.852
Ooh, and French toast.
How could I ever forget that?

12:50.921 --> 12:52.320
Did you see anything suspicious?

12:52.389 --> 12:55.323
Anything, even the smallest
details can help.

12:55.392 --> 12:58.226
No, and I'm always very focused.

12:58.295 --> 13:00.028
Croissants... plain and chocolate.

13:00.096 --> 13:01.196
Yeah, thank you!

13:01.264 --> 13:02.530
But we have to go.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.567
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, you know what?

13:05.635 --> 13:08.169
I did see something strange.

13:08.238 --> 13:11.706
This morning, when I was
next door at the supermarket,

13:11.775 --> 13:15.677
there was a guy, sturdy
and red curly hair.

13:15.745 --> 13:18.746
He was walking around
the back of the supermarket,

13:18.815 --> 13:20.615
which is weird because the entrance

13:20.684 --> 13:21.950
is in the front.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.885
Now, I don't know if that's useful.

13:23.954 --> 13:26.287
It is. Thank you.

13:26.356 --> 13:28.490
- Oh, and one more thing.
- Yeah?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.458
We have quiche.

13:30.527 --> 13:31.759
Great, thanks.

13:31.828 --> 13:33.094
We'll have to come back one morning.

13:33.163 --> 13:34.929
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.238
Good, I'm glad you called.
I wanted to speak to you.

13:43.306 --> 13:45.340
Of course, this is urgent.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.108
So it's true the Hunters found out

13:47.177 --> 13:49.143
that the security images
have been tampered with?

13:49.212 --> 13:51.412
Yes, but don't worry.
We're doing everything we can

13:51.481 --> 13:53.256
to close this case
as soon as possible.

13:53.263 --> 13:53.854
Good.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.417
You still have eyes on them, right?

13:56.486 --> 13:57.619
As we speak.

14:00.824 --> 14:03.124
You've got to see this.

14:09.132 --> 14:10.465
Fourth floor.

14:15.238 --> 14:16.571
Apoll0, are you there?

14:17.908 --> 14:19.574
Locating server room.

14:25.849 --> 14:29.417
These kids came to give
their mother a cake.

14:29.486 --> 14:31.185
What's the name again?

14:31.254 --> 14:33.821
Uh...

14:33.890 --> 14:34.889
Ka... Ka...

14:34.958 --> 14:36.558
You don't know your mother's name?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.326
It's Sh...

14:38.395 --> 14:40.028
- Nicole.
- Felicia.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.362
- Nicole Felicia.
- Felicia Nicole.

14:46.002 --> 14:47.969
Oh, I forgot the cake.

14:48.038 --> 14:49.571
Yeah, we need a...

14:49.639 --> 14:50.838
We have to come back again.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.574
Okay, let's go.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.645
I think I got it.

14:57.714 --> 15:00.148
Downloading data.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.249
Downloading.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.586
Downloading.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.087
Out, out!

15:09.359 --> 15:10.692
Change of plans, Apoll0.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.360
You need to find another way out.

15:12.429 --> 15:14.529
Downloading.

15:14.598 --> 15:15.930
Downloading.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.100
Downloaded all the files.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.102
I am gonna find an alternative route.

15:24.574 --> 15:25.773
I found an exit.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.342
Are you guys ready?

15:27.410 --> 15:29.243
I am gonna jump out the window.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.214
- He's jumping.
- She's jumping.

15:33.283 --> 15:35.016
Well, it's jumping.

15:35.085 --> 15:36.884
He, she, it, I don't care!

15:36.953 --> 15:37.986
It's jumping!

15:39.155 --> 15:40.388
Where?!

15:42.792 --> 15:44.626
Through that window.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.111
Oops.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.699
So, what'd you write down?

16:07.767 --> 16:10.902
Let's see. Um...

16:10.970 --> 16:12.570
That the cafe also serves breakfast.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.672
They have coffee, pancakes,
French toast...

16:14.741 --> 16:16.874
And do you think that will
help us solve the case?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.210
No.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.713
Don't worry about it.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.915
That's why, normally,
detectives work in pairs.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.616
So that one person can catch

16:25.685 --> 16:27.018
what the other person might have missed.

16:27.087 --> 16:30.355
Now, the owner did tell us
one very important thing.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.790
That she saw a guy with red hair.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.426
Yes, and what did we find on the glove?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.728
A red hair.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.196
Well done.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.098
Celebration selfie!

16:44.070 --> 16:46.204
You think you'll be able to fix it?

16:46.272 --> 16:47.839
Let's hope for the best.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.173
Screwdriver.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.244
Pliers.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.449
Cupcake.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.789
I think... it just might make it.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.565
Apoll0, can you hear us?

17:22.942 --> 17:24.242
Hello, Apoll0?

17:30.917 --> 17:32.383
Apoll0, can you hear us?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.263
None of these guys have red hair.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.601
Can I help with something?

17:50.670 --> 17:53.070
Solving a case always takes some time.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.273
Also, I want to score
some points with Simon,

17:55.341 --> 17:58.176
so it'd really help if
I solve it by myself.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.179
Daniel, Simon's asking for you.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.680
He wants to know how far you've gotten

18:02.749 --> 18:04.549
with your new case.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.950
Wait here for me.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.791
Nope. No.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.305
Oh, that is actually a decent picture.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.739
That... Yeesh!

18:28.808 --> 18:30.041
Not my best angle.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.442
Delete.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.878
Wait.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.284
Daniel, I think I found something.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.452
Really?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.890
Who is there?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.429
That could be him.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.830
Anika!

18:54.167 --> 18:56.067
It's amazing!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.768
You may be a little clumsy sometimes,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.770
but you are the best
assistant in the world.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.073
- Really?
- Yes, really. I'm so proud of you.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.316
Can you hear us?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.818
Yes.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.722
Apoll0, I'm sorry
I didn't catch you there.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.990
I said yes.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.492
No, I meant like
I didn't catch you there

19:21.561 --> 19:23.528
back at the Telecom Company.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.996
That's okay.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.465
Were you able to recover
the photos from my hard drive?

19:27.534 --> 19:30.001
- Yep.
- Great.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.169
Now grant me access to your system.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.341
Give me a few minutes.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.877
I'll have the hacker's location
in no time.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.279
That's great.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.648
But you will have to go on
without me from here.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.082
Will you be okay?

19:45.151 --> 19:46.584
Um, yeah.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.885
I'm still safe at home.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.520
Oh...

19:49.589 --> 19:50.821
All right, yeah.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.057
I... I like to think that
you're actually in there,

19:53.126 --> 19:54.992
like some sort of miniature driver.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.460
Yeah, me too.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.795
So did you get the address?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.096
Give me a second.

19:59.165 --> 20:02.600
And... yes.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.101
Got it.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.673
abandoned train depot.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.808
- I will send it to your phone.
- Okay.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.076
Yep, got it.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.644
Let's go find that hacker.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.383
You should take a look at this.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.888
- What is this?
- That is a photo of our main suspect.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.122
The main suspect?

20:26.492 --> 20:27.692
That's a strong lead.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.827
Surprisingly well done, Daniel.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.699
Oh, wait, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.702
Please make sure that
your brothers and sisters

20:37.770 --> 20:40.071
keep their noses out of
your father's case.

20:40.139 --> 20:43.808
I mean, they're interfering
with our investigation.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.076
You need to take care of it.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.244
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.746
Yeah, we have to go.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.348
So thank you, Mr. Simon.
Today was very educational.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.916
But we have to go now. So let's go.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.084
Thanks.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.419
What was that?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.254
Tess sent me a message.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.656
They found the hacker.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.958
Let's go.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.797
The hacker hideout should
be around here somewhere.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.402
Hm, are you sure
this is the place?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.571
Sal, you're a computer whizz.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.539
Imagine yourself behind a computer.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.642
Where would your perfect spot be?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.910
Well, it would have to be
near the edge of the train

21:19.979 --> 21:21.879
for a better connection.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.015
Out of view for privacy.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.683
And, uh...

21:25.752 --> 21:27.952
Oh, and finally, it would have to be

21:28.021 --> 21:29.754
dark and quiet, and, and...

21:29.822 --> 21:31.055
Like this?

21:32.492 --> 21:33.524
Exactly.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.925
Careful, guys.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.061
We don't know what we might run into.
