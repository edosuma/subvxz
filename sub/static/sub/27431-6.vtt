WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.836
- Previously on Gotham...
- Everybody,

00:03.087 --> 00:05.507
raise your glasses
to the killer

00:05.673 --> 00:07.675
of Jeremiah Valeska.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.010
(cheering)

00:09.177 --> 00:10.678
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.096
Get out of here, Barbara.

00:21.439 --> 00:22.315
(gunshon

00:26.110 --> 00:26.778
Eduardo?

00:26.945 --> 00:28.321
Nice shot, right?

00:30.073 --> 00:31.533
Tell me what you did!

00:31.699 --> 00:33.368
I put a chip in your brain.

00:33.535 --> 00:34.410
Better talk, now.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.079
A contract came along.

00:36.246 --> 00:38.081
A contract from who?

00:38.248 --> 00:39.332
(beeps)

00:39.499 --> 00:42.085
Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

00:42.252 --> 00:43.419
Walker was behind this?

00:43.586 --> 00:45.296
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

00:49.926 --> 00:51.386
-(gasps)
- Ouch.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.054
Stitches still sore, huh?

00:53.221 --> 00:56.057
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

00:56.224 --> 00:58.643
into my flesh at least once.

00:58.935 --> 00:59.644
(beeps)

00:59.811 --> 01:00.937
You know Jim Gordon.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.146
You know this city.

01:02.564 --> 01:03.940
Find him. And kill him.

01:10.405 --> 01:12.365
(panting)

01:40.893 --> 01:42.604
(gunfire)

01:45.565 --> 01:46.816
(grunts)

01:48.693 --> 01:51.863
Your chances of survival
are astronomically low, James.

01:54.324 --> 01:56.659
Continuing to run
is ill-advised.

02:13.426 --> 02:14.927
(door opens)

02:37.283 --> 02:38.451
(thudding)

02:44.916 --> 02:46.793
(whirring)

02:55.301 --> 02:57.345
<i>IS'</i>

03:03.518 --> 03:05.687
Hope you're well rested, Edward.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.981
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

03:11.693 --> 03:12.402
(sighs)

03:12.568 --> 03:14.904
Edward?
(chuckles)

03:16.322 --> 03:17.615
(sniffing)

03:17.865 --> 03:20.326
Edward, what is it?

03:21.494 --> 03:23.162
Is someone down there, boy?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.249
(Edward whimpers)

03:26.833 --> 03:28.376
MAGPIE:

03:34.465 --> 03:36.676
Ooh, pretty, Pretty-

03:36.843 --> 03:39.929
I'll call you Charlotte.
(giggles)

03:40.096 --> 03:43.349
Ooh, you're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

03:44.142 --> 03:46.018
Oswald Cobblepot.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.896
But I'm guessing
you already knew that.

03:57.447 --> 03:58.448
Stop!

04:03.995 --> 04:06.706
Penguin. Didn't think
you'd miss a couple things.

04:06.873 --> 04:08.666
Couple things go missing
all the time.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.668
How did you know
about this place?

04:11.294 --> 04:13.004
All of the thieves I used
are dead.

04:13.171 --> 04:14.422
YEP, yep-

04:15.131 --> 04:16.339
Was on a job.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.091
Someone got there first.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.761
Followed them
back here.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.803
Saw you. Bang, bang.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.308
Then you know what is in store.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.145
I do hope whatever you came
here for was worth your life.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.483
(both laugh)

04:33.900 --> 04:34.984
The Russifer Diamond.

04:35.151 --> 04:38.863
Not Russifer. Charlotte.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.032
What's in your other hand?

04:44.160 --> 04:46.120
Wait, how did you...

04:50.708 --> 04:51.459
(groans)

04:51.626 --> 04:52.752
Bye-bye.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.341
(panting)

05:03.137 --> 05:06.474
Who the hell was that?

05:08.184 --> 05:10.978
(grunts)
Oh, God...

05:11.145 --> 05:12.730
Oh!
(pa"“"9)

05:13.022 --> 05:15.483
Oh, God. It happened
again, didn't it?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.026
What did I do?

05:17.193 --> 05:18.653
You tried to kill me.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.656
Oh. Is that all?

05:22.031 --> 05:23.533
I need answers, Ed.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.868
I know Walker gave the orders
to destroy Haven

05:26.035 --> 05:27.662
and the supply helicopter.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.372
What is she planning next?

05:29.539 --> 05:30.540
I don't know.

05:32.083 --> 05:35.503
Jim, I don't remember anything
once I go under.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.630
You're bleeding.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.761
You have to let me go.
I'm not responsible for this.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.097
That chip in your head
could be evidence.

05:46.472 --> 05:47.974
So unless you want me
to rip it out,

05:48.474 --> 05:50.560
- you're coming with me. - Okay.

05:50.726 --> 05:51.561
(grunts)

05:51.727 --> 05:53.604
(gunfire in distance)

05:57.275 --> 05:59.235
(indistinct chatter)

06:03.823 --> 06:04.574
ALFRED:
Bruce.

06:04.991 --> 06:05.825
There you are.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.662
So, go on, then.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.123
How'd it go with Selina?

06:13.291 --> 06:13.958
Oh, dear.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.669
Well, I am sorry, Master Bruce,
but perhaps it's for the best.

06:16.836 --> 06:19.881
Maybe. That's not why I called
you here. You see this?

06:20.214 --> 06:22.550
Yeah, I know, right?
Looks like Captain Gordon's

06:22.717 --> 06:25.094
finally getting the help
this city so desperately needs.

06:25.595 --> 06:26.637
Is he?

06:27.138 --> 06:29.140
What the people desperately
need is food and medicine.

06:29.307 --> 06:30.516
Not just more guns.

06:32.852 --> 06:33.769
What is it?

06:34.645 --> 06:35.855
No, it's just this unit.

06:36.022 --> 06:38.107
Their motto is "Born of Blood."

06:42.236 --> 06:43.362
You know them?

06:43.779 --> 06:44.655
Yeah, by reputation only.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.282
They're a horrible bunch
of bastards.

06:46.616 --> 06:49.452
They specialize in military
coups, assassinations.

06:49.619 --> 06:50.912
They're certainly
not the vanguard

06:51.078 --> 06:53.247
for humanitarian relief.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.292
Excuse me.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.170
When's the supply
shipment gonna be here?

06:59.670 --> 07:00.630
Suppfies?

07:00.796 --> 07:02.465
These people are
desperate for food,

07:03.215 --> 07:04.926
clean water, medicine.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.219
Oh, yeah. It's on its way.

07:09.305 --> 07:10.598
Where's Captain Gordon?

07:13.726 --> 07:15.186
We lost sight of Gordon.

07:15.353 --> 07:18.022
But don't worry. Eduardo's out
there looking for him right now.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.025
Unless you know
where we might find him?

07:21.776 --> 07:23.778
Logically, he'd come here.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.489
Unless there's some
reason he can't.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.325
Tell you what, kiddo.

07:30.201 --> 07:31.953
I'm gonna find you and your
friend a quiet place in the back

07:32.119 --> 07:32.954
where you can
wait for Gordon.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.080
Ah, don't you worry
about it, mate.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.665
We'll just catch up
with him later.

07:35.831 --> 07:36.999
I insist.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.268
We need to find Jim.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.605
So the government is behind
Haven and the supply helicopter,

07:59.772 --> 08:01.983
and they did it with a chip
in this one's head?

08:02.233 --> 08:03.275
Is that really
the craziest thing

08:03.442 --> 08:04.360
you've ever heard, Barbara?

08:04.735 --> 08:05.695
Bruce hit me up on the radio

08:05.861 --> 08:07.154
a little while ago,
looking for you.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.073
Said things are amiss
in the GCPD.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.993
I'll reach out, see if we
can meet up somewhere safe.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.245
Can you pull in some of your
people, see if they can help?

08:14.412 --> 08:16.414
No. I need them
guarding my territory.

08:17.081 --> 08:17.832
But you have me.

08:18.040 --> 08:18.749
And me.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.418
I don't trust you.

08:21.002 --> 08:22.378
With or without
that chip in your head.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.546
Jim.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.882
They used me as a pawn
to murder innocent people.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.135
They messed with my brain.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.637
The thing that I want
is revenge.

08:32.138 --> 08:35.099
How do I know that chip
can't be reactivated?

08:36.058 --> 08:37.268
Well, when you found
me at Strange's lab,

08:37.434 --> 08:39.645
he was fixing it after a...

08:40.479 --> 08:41.897
car battery mishap--

08:42.063 --> 08:44.650
I-it's safe to say
that I think you shorted it out.

08:45.776 --> 08:46.694
Let me look at that.

08:47.153 --> 08:48.821
- What?
- Your neck.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.704
That's gonna need stitches.
I have a first aid kit.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.874
I need to keep moving.
Just name your fee.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.500
Can't I just want to help?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.836
Not you, not usually.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.047
Friend of mine just
tried to kill me.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.590
I don't want anyone else
waiting for an excuse

09:07.757 --> 09:09.800
- to stab me in the back.
- I gave you Gerry the Jerkwad,

09:09.967 --> 09:11.552
and I'm letting you
hide out in my club.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.138
If I wanted to betray you,
I would have done it earlier.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.890
So, where's that first aid kit?

09:18.601 --> 09:20.561
Gonna make myself useful.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.689
What's it gonna take
for you to trust me?

09:24.732 --> 09:28.527
After everything you've done,
I honestly don't know.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.072
EDUARDO:
I'd listen to her, Jim.

09:33.532 --> 09:37.161
I hear trust is in short supply.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.378
EDUARDO: You forget your
PSYOPS training, Jim?

09:46.629 --> 09:49.507
Lesson one: when a person
is in trouble,

09:49.799 --> 09:51.425
they go to a familiar place.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.137
Your ex-fiancée's bar was
just a stone's throw away,

09:55.346 --> 09:58.099
so it's nice to finally
meet you, Barbara.

09:58.516 --> 09:59.517
Screw you.

09:59.809 --> 10:00.559
Hmm.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.522
It seems
you've lost your tail.

10:05.523 --> 10:06.899
You mean the psychopath

10:07.066 --> 10:08.442
you ordered to kill me?

10:09.443 --> 10:11.028
You had your chance.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.989
It could have been
like old times, buddy.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.574
You, me, together,

10:16.117 --> 10:18.452
making the world a better place.

10:18.911 --> 10:21.789
- By murdering civilians?
- Civilians?

10:22.248 --> 10:25.251
This hellhole is infested
with criminals and terrorists.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.837
Sometimes you just have
to clean house, you know?

10:28.129 --> 10:29.296
I won't let you.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.132
It's not your call, Jim.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.842
(guns clicking)

10:33.342 --> 10:34.760
I'm not dead yet.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.141
James Gordon,
I've been ordered to kill you.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.852
Well, looks like you haven't
lost that tail after all.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.653
(straining):
If I die,

10:53.571 --> 10:56.115
you'll never get the evidence!

10:56.907 --> 10:58.409
Stand down.

11:03.372 --> 11:08.294
I have evidence that you
and Walker are behind Haven.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.006
If I die, it gets out
to the entire country.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.466
It's time to make a deal.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.969
You don't have any evidence.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.263
Is that a risk
you're willing to take?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.600
It is.

11:23.017 --> 11:25.311
Nygma, kill them both.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.543
(bell tolling in distance)

11:54.924 --> 11:56.300
(screaming)

11:59.929 --> 12:01.222
(door closes)

12:10.147 --> 12:11.106
Bad time?

12:13.609 --> 12:15.319
(sighs) What
do you want?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.285
Depends.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.620
What did they want?

12:25.579 --> 12:28.123
Oh. A shot at me.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.834
I killed Jeremiah Valeska.

12:31.669 --> 12:32.836
(laughs softly)

12:33.254 --> 12:34.755
So the rumors are true.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.548
Yeah.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.802
And now, every scumbag in town
wants to take me down

12:39.969 --> 12:41.637
to make a name
for themselves.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.683
So I got to find a new squat.

12:48.477 --> 12:52.398
How about, in exchange
for helping me find someone,

12:53.315 --> 12:55.359
I let you crash in my citadel?

12:55.734 --> 12:57.444
It's seen better days, but...

12:57.820 --> 12:59.571
flaughsy
...then again, right?

12:59.905 --> 13:00.781
Who?

13:01.407 --> 13:03.951
A miscreant I caught in the act
of stealing from me.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.161
She was going to replace
the stolen item

13:06.328 --> 13:10.082
with an exact replica,
except the replica was a bomb.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.418
- (chuckles)
- Ring any bells?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.169
White hair, feathered collar,

13:14.336 --> 13:16.046
kind of of resembles
a goth chicken?

13:16.297 --> 13:17.464
You do know her.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.216
(chuckles)

13:19.675 --> 13:21.593
She goes by the name Magpie.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.430
What'd she steal?

13:25.514 --> 13:26.807
The Russifer Diamond.

13:27.725 --> 13:31.186
What makes you think
I would help you

13:32.271 --> 13:33.522
after you
killed Tabitha

13:33.689 --> 13:35.149
in cold blood?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.235
Because you believe
in an eye for an eye.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.530
Hard as it may be to swallow,

13:42.031 --> 13:45.034
Tabitha made her bed
when she killed my mother.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.664
Tell you what.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.751
I will help you

13:54.877 --> 13:57.838
if I get to keep the diamond.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.842
Flaughs)

14:02.009 --> 14:03.302
What?

14:06.638 --> 14:07.890
Not a chance.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.310
Ha, ha, ha.
Then you'll never find her.

14:11.977 --> 14:16.398
And every person in Gotham
will think it's okay

14:16.565 --> 14:18.359
to steal from Penguin.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.028
Is that what you want?

14:23.781 --> 14:25.074
You know me too well.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.451
Fine.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.287
Good.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.122
- What happened?
- EDUARDO: I want every soldier

14:32.289 --> 14:33.957
in the field looking
for Jim Gordon.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.585
Sir, we maxed out
the holding cells.

14:36.794 --> 14:39.171
We may need to keep men here
to control the overflow.

14:40.381 --> 14:42.216
Ethan, Sumiko.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.426
We're moving to phase two.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.556
(grunts)

14:49.723 --> 14:50.933
What in the hell's going on?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.310
Listen up.

14:53.811 --> 14:55.646
I am not here to play nice.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.440
I am not here
to hold anyone's hand.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.110
I am here on a simple mission.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.906
Any questions about the nature
of that mission?

15:06.240 --> 15:09.576
Are you insane?
You can't just execute people.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.203
Do not question me.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.205
This is the mission.
If you don't like it,

15:13.372 --> 15:15.165
you'll be locked up,
you'll remain locked up,

15:15.332 --> 15:17.000
until we purge
the criminal element

15:17.167 --> 15:18.627
from the streets of Gotham.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.797
Sir, Secretary Walker's
on the radio.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.257
(cell door closes)

15:24.758 --> 15:26.927
We've moved on to phase two,
but we've lost track

15:27.094 --> 15:28.679
of Gordon and Nygma.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.848
I think Gordon found a way
to fry the chip.

15:31.807 --> 15:32.724
WALKER:
We can't have Nygma

15:32.891 --> 15:35.060
in the wind with all that
evidence in his head.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.271
Just trust me.
Once we find them...

15:37.438 --> 15:38.605
Don't bother.

15:38.897 --> 15:42.818
I have an idea that will bring
Jim Gordon and Nygma to us.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.697
Thanks for getting
everyone here.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.615
And for the Wayne R and D.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.743
Are you sure about including
Barbara Kean and Ed Nygma?

15:52.494 --> 15:54.288
War makes
for strange bedfellows.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.415
It's good to have
a friend nearby, Bruce.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.917
Ow! Would you be careful?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.836
If you'll stop moving,
this will go a lot faster.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.629
NYGMA: Well, if you would be
more careful, I wouldn't potato

16:02.796 --> 16:04.673
all the long legs
from the hidden spoon.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.092
What just happened?

16:07.426 --> 16:09.636
I believe the chip is installed
against his speech center.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.805
Huh. Do it again.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.600
The human brain is not
a plaything, Ms. Kean.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.228
Please don't habituate
the curtain rod.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.688
(chuckles)

16:20.022 --> 16:22.691
And... ah.

16:23.442 --> 16:24.193
Stay.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.489
There. How does that feel?

16:28.822 --> 16:29.781
(grunts)

16:30.949 --> 16:32.659
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.621
Oh, God.
Thank you, Lucius.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.707
LUCIUS: So what exactly
are we looking for?

16:39.124 --> 16:42.002
Anything tying Walker or Eduardo
to the destruction of Haven.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.046
Why would Walker
kill all those people?

16:44.338 --> 16:46.089
That's what we
have to find out.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.383
Oh, yes.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.180
It appears the chip
retains an audio log

16:53.347 --> 16:56.058
of every verbal communication
with Nygma while he was under.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.685
There's some damage, but...

16:58.852 --> 17:00.562
if the command to attack
Haven is still here,

17:00.729 --> 17:01.730
I can trace it back
to the computer

17:01.897 --> 17:02.856
from which it originated.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.316
It has to be Walker.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.611
They won't be able to sweep
this under the rug anymore.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.659
Are you out there, Jim?

17:16.286 --> 17:17.496
What do you want?

17:19.373 --> 17:21.083
We have someone here...

17:21.791 --> 17:23.919
...who wants
to say hello.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.592
THOMPKINS:
J-Jim? What's happening?

17:33.053 --> 17:33.887
Lee?

17:39.643 --> 17:40.936
We found the Queen
of the Narrows

17:41.103 --> 17:44.189
in a run-down hidey-hole
on the north side. Tell me,

17:44.523 --> 17:47.568
how many ex-fiancées
do you have, anyway?

17:47.901 --> 17:49.444
Leave her out of this.
She's not involved.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.406
Ah, but she's a criminal,
and all criminals in Gotham

17:52.573 --> 17:54.324
are now under a death sentence.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.953
But what happens next
is up to you.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.746
A trade, perhaps.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.292
Lee Thompkins for Ed Nygma.

18:05.294 --> 18:06.461
Fine.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.757
Good. Bring Nygma
to the GCPD now.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.551
No, we meet at Haven.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.803
I want you to see
the carnage you've caused.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.597
Always so emotional.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.724
That's not how wars
are won, Jim.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.601
Those are my terms.
Take it or leave it.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.769
(radio crackles)

18:23.395 --> 18:26.398
Okay. I'll play your game.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.402
What are you doing?

18:30.694 --> 18:32.446
He's never gonna
let you walk out of there.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.616
I don't recall volunteering
as a trading chit!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.826
He doesn't want Ed.
He wants the chip.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.078
So I'll give him
the chip. Bruce,

18:40.495 --> 18:42.331
do you have any contacts
in the mainland press?

18:42.497 --> 18:43.498
Several.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.834
What would it take to broadcast
the information from the chip

18:46.001 --> 18:48.086
- to the mainland?
- A transmitter, which I have,

18:48.253 --> 18:50.505
and a very large antenna,
which I do not.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.760
I know where there's an antenna
in the Green Zone,

18:54.926 --> 18:55.969
but you're not gonna like it.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.971
The roof of the GCPD.

19:03.852 --> 19:04.770
(whispering):
Lee.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.360
- Harvey.
- Where the hell have you been?

19:11.526 --> 19:12.736
You've been gone for months.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.154
I don't know.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.658
I can't remember anything.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.242
What happened to me?

19:19.493 --> 19:22.371
I don't know.
We're gonna figure it out.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.705
I promise.

19:24.039 --> 19:24.998
Let's go.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.877
BULLOCK:
It's gonna be okay.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.176
(beeping, clicking)

19:36.343 --> 19:37.678
GORDON (over radio):
Eduardo just arrived.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.222
He brought backup,
like we expected. Time to move.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.348
Copy that.

19:42.391 --> 19:43.266
Let's go.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.527
(birds squawking)

19:57.572 --> 19:58.240
THOMPKINS:
Jim!

19:58.657 --> 20:00.158
Who are these people?

20:00.575 --> 20:02.494
I'm gonna get you
out of here, Lee.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.996
I'm not sure that's true, Jim.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.416
It seems you forgot
to bring someone.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.335
It's hard to make a swap
when you have nothing to trade.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.339
We both know this
is really what you want.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.134
Proof that you and Walker
are responsible

20:17.300 --> 20:18.677
for the destruction of Haven

20:18.927 --> 20:21.012
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

20:25.809 --> 20:26.977
Now let her go.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.439
Let me guess, you made a copy

20:30.605 --> 20:33.108
so you can do this little bit
of theatrics for me.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.860
I expected more from you, Jim.

20:35.277 --> 20:39.239
Three soldiers against one man
without a gun.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.285
You sure you brought
enough help?

20:43.827 --> 20:45.078
I don't need any help.

20:46.455 --> 20:49.040
Is that why you sent Nygma
to do your dirty work?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.918
So he could pick up your slack
like I used to?

20:52.085 --> 20:55.547
Still dining out on pulling me
from that burning truck.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.091
I carried more
than my fair share.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.760
I was always the first man in.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.928
Your recklessness
got people killed.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.097
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.140
Ramirez?

21:05.599 --> 21:06.266
No.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.350
Johnson.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.769
Bolton.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.687
Their deaths were not on me.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.064
Yeah.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.066
Put a bullet in my mouth

21:15.233 --> 21:16.443
and shut me up.

21:18.570 --> 21:19.529
No.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.532
Not a bullet.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.035
But I am gonna shut your mouth.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.204
Once and for all.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.289
Come try.

21:32.167 --> 21:35.003
(creaking)

21:35.712 --> 21:36.588
You sure this
is the place?

21:36.755 --> 21:37.714
Yep.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.300
This is the place.

21:53.855 --> 21:54.898
Stop her!

21:56.900 --> 21:59.110
Ouchie. You're quick.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.409
I know you?

22:07.118 --> 22:09.329
- Doubt it.
- Uh-huh.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.791
You killed Jeremiah.
You're famous.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.168
(laughs)
Not so scary.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.586
I could be famous.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.380
You want a shot at me, too?

22:18.547 --> 22:21.758
Unfortunately, you won't
have the opportunity.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.343
Careful.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.178
This is my workshop

22:25.554 --> 22:27.222
where I make my boom-booms.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.141
Anything here, boom, boom.
Then more boom

22:30.308 --> 22:32.269
and more boom,
then the whole room...

22:32.435 --> 22:35.814
- Boom, boom. We get it.
- You're bluffing.

22:35.981 --> 22:36.815
Catch.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.359
Ooh! No, no!

22:41.987 --> 22:45.031
- (watch ticking)
- MAGPIE: Whoops!

22:45.198 --> 22:48.201
(laughs) That watch
must have been an original,

22:48.410 --> 22:50.620
but other stuff
in there, boom, boom.

22:50.996 --> 22:52.205
Good luck.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.551
We tie our
shoelaces together,

23:04.718 --> 23:06.636
then we lasso the keys
off the desk.

23:06.803 --> 23:10.265
And then what, Roy Rogers, huh?
They surrender in awe?

23:10.599 --> 23:13.101
No harebrained scheme is
gonna get us out of here.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.645
Hello!

23:16.938 --> 23:18.815
Hope you don't mind, I...

23:19.399 --> 23:22.485
borrowed some cop stuff
from the garage.

23:22.736 --> 23:24.946
Oh, boy, you can
put your guns down.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.866
Kevlar in this thing
is designed to withstand a blast

23:28.074 --> 23:30.368
that can tear down a building
twice this size.

23:30.869 --> 23:31.536
What is that?

23:33.413 --> 23:34.915
Is it not obvious?

23:35.165 --> 23:36.541
It's a bomb!

23:37.000 --> 23:39.252
Okay.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.130
Let's play a game.

23:45.467 --> 23:48.345
- Clear out.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.306
If anyone leaves this building,
this thing blows.

23:52.682 --> 23:56.353
You gomers messed with
the wrong super genius,

23:56.561 --> 23:58.730
and now it's time
for a little payback.

23:58.897 --> 24:01.066
Nygma, you're a son of a bitch!

24:02.484 --> 24:04.569
Oh, not now, Bullock.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.572
The body count at Haven
wasn't big enough for you, huh?

24:07.739 --> 24:08.740
Shut up!

24:09.783 --> 24:10.951
What's your game?

24:11.117 --> 24:12.911
The only way
to deactivate this bomb

24:13.453 --> 24:16.289
is to put a four-digit code
on the keypad there.

24:16.581 --> 24:17.832
What's the code?

24:18.541 --> 24:19.876
(clears throat)

24:21.419 --> 24:25.799
The pallid beach mouse
can give birth every four weeks.

24:27.133 --> 24:27.842
Assuming we start

24:28.009 --> 24:29.094
with two mice,

24:29.260 --> 24:33.056
and that the size
of an average litter is 12 mice,

24:33.515 --> 24:36.810
and that they are equally
split male to female,

24:37.310 --> 24:39.771
how many pallid beach mice

24:39.938 --> 24:43.692
would we have
at the end of one year?

24:46.903 --> 24:50.115
The answer to that question
is the code.

24:51.574 --> 24:52.701
Oh, I almost forgot.

24:52.867 --> 24:56.246
- You have two minutes.
- (beeps)

24:56.621 --> 24:59.332
After that,
everyone in here goes splat.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.460
Except for me, of course.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.923
(panting)

25:18.518 --> 25:19.561
I'm in position.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.773
Copy. Plug the recorder
to the transmitter.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.692
Next, you'll connect
the transmitter to the radio.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.777
There should be a black box
at the base of the antenna.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.529
Let me know
when you get it open.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.700
- Nygma's bomb ploy won't last forever.
- We just have to

25:33.867 --> 25:35.076
wait for the exhaust
fans to come to

25:35.243 --> 25:37.120
a complete stop before
you can use the gas.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.096
What are you doing?

25:55.555 --> 25:57.432
(grunting and groaning)

26:02.353 --> 26:03.855
(both grunting)

26:10.070 --> 26:12.238
(both groaning)

26:12.572 --> 26:16.576
You want to take responsibility
for people dying?

26:17.243 --> 26:18.620
Look around.

26:19.537 --> 26:20.663
This is all on you.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.207
What the hell does that mean?

26:22.624 --> 26:23.917
Walker spent months

26:24.209 --> 26:26.628
trying to convince
her superiors that Gotham

26:26.836 --> 26:28.546
was overrun by criminals.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.216
We were this close
to being sent in

26:32.008 --> 26:34.135
when you set up Haven.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.055
The fact that
one man was able

26:37.222 --> 26:38.973
to safely house
and rescue hundreds

26:39.140 --> 26:41.267
of innocent civilians
showed the military higher-ups

26:41.392 --> 26:43.478
that the criminal element
of Gotham

26:43.645 --> 26:46.356
must not be so big
and scary after all.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.943
They were ready
to send in relief,

26:51.194 --> 26:52.904
so it had to come down.

26:54.239 --> 26:57.367
Why? What the hell
does she want?

26:57.909 --> 27:00.495
They were innocent
people, children.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.581
They were an acceptable loss
for the mission.

27:04.624 --> 27:05.834
What mission, damn it?

27:13.091 --> 27:14.259
Flaughs)

27:21.641 --> 27:22.767
That's enough.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.437
(grunts)

27:26.604 --> 27:29.482
Take her out back and shoot her.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.279
He doesn't need to see this.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.158
It's my gift to you,

27:38.491 --> 27:39.742
a small mercy.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.335
You never should have
brought her into this, Eduardo.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.378
(groans)

28:04.267 --> 28:06.227
Can we speed things along,
please, Mr. Fox?

28:06.394 --> 28:07.979
The exhaust fans
have to wind down

28:08.146 --> 28:09.522
before they can
change directions.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.775
If you throw the canisters in
now, the gas will blow outside.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.819
Bruce, status?

28:16.863 --> 28:17.780
One second.

28:25.622 --> 28:27.540
I'm here. The box is open.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.292
LUCIUS: Two dark green wires
right in front.

28:29.459 --> 28:32.086
Attach those to the transmitter.
The message will send.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.803
(whirring, beeping)

28:41.471 --> 28:42.555
It's done.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.103
One minute left.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.689
Everybody hear that?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.776
One minute before
this thing explodes.

28:56.361 --> 28:57.320
I know the answer.

28:58.363 --> 29:01.574
Uh... (chuckles) Nope,
don't think you do, Bullock.

29:01.741 --> 29:04.661
My high school zoology class is
still rattling around up here.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.371
High school was
a long time ago,

29:06.537 --> 29:09.165
so let's just take
the full minute, shall we?

29:09.666 --> 29:10.750
Really think about it.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.043
I don't need to.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.004
The pallid beach mouse
is extinct.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.217
It disappeared
in 1959.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.428
The number you'll have at
the end of the year is zero.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.013
The number is zero.

29:24.555 --> 29:25.515
Trust me on this.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.684
I got in trouble. I had to
write an essay about it.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.143
I swear to God.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.486
Oh, dear.

29:45.994 --> 29:49.330
(indistinct chatter)

29:54.836 --> 29:55.795
(groans)

29:57.797 --> 29:59.090
I got a math problem for you.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.508
- Count these bullets.
- (inhales)

30:18.985 --> 30:19.652
Yes!

30:20.153 --> 30:21.779
- (grunts)
- You want to know why

30:21.946 --> 30:24.824
Ramirez and the rest
didn't make it out?

30:26.826 --> 30:28.578
After your tour
of duty was up,

30:28.911 --> 30:30.538
we were caught
behind enemy lines,

30:30.830 --> 30:32.540
taken to the darkest
hell on Earth...

30:34.667 --> 30:35.960
Pefia Duro.

30:36.419 --> 30:37.295
Have you heard of it?

30:37.462 --> 30:40.673
Prison? I didn't know.

30:41.549 --> 30:42.884
No one did,

30:43.885 --> 30:47.388
'cause it's where we were
left to die by our government.

30:48.431 --> 30:50.266
I was the only one
that survived.

30:50.767 --> 30:51.601
Walker...

30:52.185 --> 30:53.644
Walker, she found me
in that place.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.188
She pulled me out.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.315
She gave me a
new purpose.

30:57.690 --> 30:58.775
She made you her killer.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.110
No, no, Jim.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.738
She's the killer.

31:04.197 --> 31:06.449
And you have no idea.

31:21.964 --> 31:24.592
. Lee?

31:43.653 --> 31:47.156
You and your stupid revenge.

31:47.698 --> 31:50.410
The diamond isn't even worth
anything in Gotham anyway.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.039
Unless...

31:58.459 --> 32:01.921
The diamond is worth
something on the mainland.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.674
And I bet you have

32:05.466 --> 32:08.469
way more where that came from.

32:12.807 --> 32:13.933
You're leaving Gotham.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.481
Congratulations,
you're a genius.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.442
Why?

32:23.693 --> 32:25.486
"Alexander the Great

32:25.862 --> 32:28.030
"then looked upon his land

32:28.573 --> 32:29.824
"and wept.

32:30.074 --> 32:33.202
For there was nothing left
to conquer."

32:36.247 --> 32:38.207
I've done all I can in Gotham.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.335
Some things twice.
(chuckles lightly)

32:43.004 --> 32:45.089
There's nothing left
for me here anymore.

32:47.508 --> 32:48.718
I want in.

32:50.845 --> 32:53.806
I can't even walk
around the city

32:53.973 --> 32:56.267
without some lowlife
trying to take me out.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.394
Just so he can
up his cred.

32:59.103 --> 33:01.856
I don't want to be the person
who killed Jeremiah Valeska.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.776
I just want to be myself.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.281
And I can't do that
in Gotham anymore.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.493
My heart weeps for you.

33:15.328 --> 33:16.454
But no.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.292
- What if I could get us out of here?
- (Oswald laughs)

33:21.459 --> 33:23.252
You do that, I will cut you in.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.545
50-50.

33:25.046 --> 33:28.966
Ten percent,
and I won't murder you

33:29.133 --> 33:31.594
- once we reach the mainland.
- Deal.

33:33.304 --> 33:34.472
Selina, wait!

33:38.851 --> 33:44.190
She said, "Anything in the room
could be a bomb."

33:44.440 --> 33:46.317
Not the room itself.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.736
Did you know that
the whole time?

33:49.111 --> 33:50.154
Just thought of it.

33:51.656 --> 33:52.323
We should hurry before

33:52.490 --> 33:53.783
she gets away with
all our stuff.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.076
Don't worry.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.620
She won't get far.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.667
Alvarez, take Lee
to my office.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.001
Be right there.

34:04.961 --> 34:06.712
I got to be honest
with you, man.

34:07.296 --> 34:08.922
I don't know how many more
of these close calls

34:09.090 --> 34:10.382
this old heart can take.

34:10.550 --> 34:11.801
We were able to transmit
the audio logs,

34:12.051 --> 34:13.469
but until I hear back
from my contacts,

34:13.636 --> 34:14.844
I won't know
if they received them.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.304
Well, if they did,

34:16.639 --> 34:18.014
probably have
a lot of questions.

34:19.016 --> 34:19.850
We'll spend the night
and help out.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.978
Alfred, can you go back to the
apartment and grab what you can?

34:22.143 --> 34:23.521
Certainly,
Master Bruce.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.606
Thanks, Bruce.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.485
The next time I
get a short straw,

34:30.652 --> 34:31.987
I'm just gonna
walk into traffic.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.614
Where has Lee been
this whole time?

34:35.824 --> 34:36.867
I don't know.

34:37.493 --> 34:38.619
I'm not gonna
wait around

34:38.786 --> 34:40.830
to watch their
touching reunion.

34:49.964 --> 34:51.882
What is happening here?

34:53.217 --> 34:54.802
I don't know where to start.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.680
When I didn't hear from you,

34:58.389 --> 35:00.349
I'd hoped you'd
gotten out of Gotham.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.894
The last thing
that I remember

35:04.645 --> 35:07.106
is Jeremiah destroying
the bridges.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.150
That was over
three months ago.

35:09.317 --> 35:11.694
Three months?
Oh, my God.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.404
You don't remember anything?

35:14.196 --> 35:15.698
I'm trying, and...

35:17.366 --> 35:19.368
Right before the bridges
came down,

35:20.077 --> 35:21.621
you said you were
leaving the city.

35:22.538 --> 35:23.205
Why didn't you?

35:23.539 --> 35:24.290
I don't know, Jim.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.125
None of this
is making any sense.

35:28.711 --> 35:30.087
We're still cut off.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.673
There's no help.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.884
It's been hard.

35:36.844 --> 35:38.721
Actually, that's not true.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.140
It's been hell.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.643
People needed hope,

35:43.809 --> 35:45.561
so I put on a
brave face.

35:46.687 --> 35:48.147
Pretended I knew
what to do.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.025
But you know me, Lee.

35:51.942 --> 35:52.902
I'm just a cop.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.908
And now I'm really lost.

36:00.034 --> 36:01.285
Hey, it's okay.

36:01.452 --> 36:03.162
(distant siren)

36:03.704 --> 36:05.623
We're here now.

36:06.540 --> 36:10.044
We'll just try to put
the pieces back together again.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.296
Maybe we can help each other.

36:15.299 --> 36:16.967
Let's start with my memory.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.472
I went back
to the Narrows.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.266
I saw Ed.

36:25.142 --> 36:27.269
We fought. We...

36:29.021 --> 36:30.022
Oh.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.149
He stabbed me.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.027
- What? - Wait, let me remember.

36:35.486 --> 36:36.904
I stabbed him.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.157
There was
so much blood.

36:42.243 --> 36:45.663
Then I was... (exhales)

36:45.830 --> 36:47.289
somewhere...

36:48.999 --> 36:50.543
A hospital, maybe?

37:11.522 --> 37:14.400
- (scoffs)
' (man groans)

37:15.568 --> 37:18.571
Eduardo. (clicks tongue)

37:18.738 --> 37:20.406
So much potential,

37:20.573 --> 37:22.908
but not quite up
to the task.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.285
- (beeping)
- Walker.

37:24.452 --> 37:25.828
(case opens)

37:26.120 --> 37:27.121
HOW?

37:27.747 --> 37:29.081
We've been burned.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.083
The press have
recordings of me

37:31.250 --> 37:33.669
instructing Nygma
to take down Haven.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.255
I thought I might
accomplish my task

37:36.422 --> 37:38.466
without setting foot
in this foul city,

37:38.632 --> 37:41.093
but that's not to be.

37:43.179 --> 37:45.848
- You won't die yet, my warrior.
- (groaning)

37:46.682 --> 37:49.185
There is so much more
for you to do.

37:49.727 --> 37:52.521
Professor Strange will have you
fixed up in no time.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.066
(device beeps, clicks)

37:56.609 --> 37:57.943
(respirator powers up)

38:01.030 --> 38:02.573
(sharp inhale)

38:02.740 --> 38:04.742
(distorted):
Jim Gordon.

38:05.493 --> 38:07.328
Don't worry
about Gordon.

38:07.912 --> 38:09.872
Nygma was never alone.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.375
There was a
second operative.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.088
(sharp inhale)

38:19.089 --> 38:20.007
You Okay?

38:20.424 --> 38:21.342
You cold?

38:24.470 --> 38:25.805
(brief whir)

38:26.722 --> 38:28.599
The hospitals were
all out of commission.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.935
Just the one clinic
in the green zone.

38:36.899 --> 38:37.566
Lee?

38:37.942 --> 38:39.401
Time to die, Jim Gordon.

38:40.653 --> 38:42.071
(Jim grunting)

38:43.989 --> 38:46.742
(both grunting)

38:51.288 --> 38:54.124
- (electricity crackles)
- (exhales)

39:03.884 --> 39:05.970
(owls hooting)

39:12.184 --> 39:14.353
(faint clanging)

39:21.485 --> 39:23.445
(leaves rustling)

39:29.869 --> 39:31.829
<i>IS'</i>

39:44.341 --> 39:46.468
- (grunts, groans)
- Ah...

39:46.635 --> 39:47.803
(thud)

39:51.223 --> 39:54.059
Wanted: one butler.

39:55.311 --> 39:57.271
Military background a plus.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.773
References required.

40:00.983 --> 40:04.069
Yes, Mr. Pennyworth.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.989
I have a job for you.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.117
(distant foghorn)

40:14.371 --> 40:15.497
(rapid gasping)

40:15.706 --> 40:17.124
SELINA: Well, you weren't
lying when you said

40:17.207 --> 40:18.417
she wouldn't get far.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.127
(dog panting)

40:21.337 --> 40:24.590
Pretty crown's...
(chuckles) booby-trapped.

40:25.215 --> 40:26.592
Ouch.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.469
Ouch, indeed.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.721
I couldn't have you
coming back here

40:30.888 --> 40:32.973
and making off with
all of my belongings.

40:33.641 --> 40:36.226
Our belongings.

40:36.852 --> 40:39.730
Cut my wings, let me go?

40:42.191 --> 40:43.192
Bang,bang.

40:44.526 --> 40:45.319
- What the hell?
- (dog whines)

40:45.486 --> 40:48.072
The buckshot in her gut
wasn't enough punishment?

40:48.530 --> 40:50.032
Just a little reminder
of what happens

40:50.199 --> 40:52.034
when people try
to steal from me.

40:52.201 --> 40:55.037
(shuddering breath)
Good to know.

40:57.539 --> 40:58.582
Partner.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.751
(sirens wailing)

41:03.712 --> 41:05.255
BULLOCK:
So Lee has a chip, too?

41:05.798 --> 41:07.925
GORDON: I don't know how,
but it seems that way.

41:08.509 --> 41:09.927
Walker must have
been holding onto her

41:10.094 --> 41:11.929
as some sort of
plan B this whole time.

41:12.096 --> 41:14.890
Three months? That's a hell
of a long game she's playing.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.935
Which means she probably has
other tricks up her sleeve.

41:18.519 --> 41:19.520
(moans)

41:20.771 --> 41:21.730
Hey.

41:24.358 --> 41:25.442
(grunts)

41:25.776 --> 41:27.444
- Welcome back.
- Oh, hell.

41:27.611 --> 41:29.321
This is gonna keep happening.

41:30.698 --> 41:32.032
What's wrong with me?

41:33.283 --> 41:35.411
The good news is, I think
I can actually answer that.

41:35.828 --> 41:37.538
- (exhales)
- (door opens)

41:37.705 --> 41:38.580
BARBARA:
Jim.

41:39.915 --> 41:41.041
I need to talk to you.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.168
Now is not a good
time, Barbara.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.505
Don't you remember the good time
we had the other night?

41:46.672 --> 41:48.173
- Over there?
- Say what?

41:48.465 --> 41:49.842
You need to leave now.

41:50.467 --> 41:51.927
I'm pregnant.

41:55.139 --> 41:56.515
Good to see you, Lee.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.600
Long time.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.110
Congratulations?

42:11.613 --> 42:12.948
(buoy bell dinging)

42:14.408 --> 42:15.451
(labored breathing)

42:18.787 --> 42:19.830
You.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.207
You're supposed
to be dead, mate.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.877
Sorry to disappoint.

42:26.170 --> 42:28.255
You hurt my boy...

42:29.131 --> 42:31.341
and I will bite your face off.

42:31.508 --> 42:33.510
(manic giggling)

42:33.677 --> 42:35.512
(laughing):
Yeah. Yeah.

42:36.472 --> 42:40.350
Ah... Bruce will be
along shortly.

42:41.101 --> 42:42.644
In the meantime...

42:45.731 --> 42:47.524
This place is in desperate need

42:47.691 --> 42:50.277
of some good, old-fashioned
butlering.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.116
How did you even find a way off
the bloody island anyway?

42:56.492 --> 42:59.495
How? One if by land,

42:59.828 --> 43:01.038
two if by sea,

43:01.497 --> 43:04.249
three if by digging
a tunnel under the river.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.211
But enough questions.

43:10.464 --> 43:12.758
Today is the big day.
