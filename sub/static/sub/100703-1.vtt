WEBVTT

00:38.552 --> 00:39.887
Ya know Ousmane Dembélé?

00:39.928 --> 00:42.014
I got fifty on Mbappé.

00:42.056 --> 00:43.182
What's up?

00:45.184 --> 00:47.102
Gonna watch the game?

00:47.645 --> 00:49.897
Bet you five that Mbappé scores.

00:51.815 --> 00:52.858
You're crazy.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.277
Double score. Bet you five bucks!

01:06.330 --> 01:09.124
Go the Blues, go the Blues!

04:39.168 --> 04:40.586
I like your hairdo,

04:40.961 --> 04:42.129
real nice.

04:43.756 --> 04:47.468
You use engine oil
or it's naturally greasy?

04:50.304 --> 04:51.138
Know what?

04:51.305 --> 04:53.390
Let's call new guy "Greaser".

04:55.225 --> 04:56.852
Dig it. Approved!

04:58.062 --> 04:59.438
Not a big fan.

05:04.735 --> 05:06.070
Greetings gents.

05:07.112 --> 05:08.405
Go France!

05:08.781 --> 05:09.740
Fuck off!

05:13.410 --> 05:14.745
Greaser, listen up.

05:14.787 --> 05:17.831
We're in the Bosquets, you heard of it?

05:18.207 --> 05:21.835
Before it was inaccessible to us.
A prime drug spot.

05:21.877 --> 05:24.838
There was hash, coke, then heroin.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.215
It ruined the hood.

05:26.256 --> 05:27.633
All the OGs died.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.595
Then the M. bros cleaned things up.

05:32.137 --> 05:33.180
Muslim Brotherhood?

05:33.639 --> 05:34.807
Yeah, the SCU.

05:36.225 --> 05:38.310
As in Street Crime Unit?

05:38.352 --> 05:40.020
Smack Combat Unit.

05:40.312 --> 05:42.147
That's what we call them.

05:42.815 --> 05:44.984
Prostitution is the new plague,

05:45.025 --> 05:46.568
run by Nigerians.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.738
They rent flats for 400 euros.

05:51.573 --> 05:55.494
Hookers turn tricks
for 10 to 20 euros.

05:56.161 --> 05:57.871
Blowjobs are 2 euros.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.334
Got 2 euros?

06:18.309 --> 06:19.852
What's up prick face?

06:19.893 --> 06:21.437
How's Bert and Ernie?

06:21.478 --> 06:23.063
Can't complain.

06:23.105 --> 06:25.316
I left a mess at your house.

06:25.357 --> 06:28.819
Your wife's face broke the armrest...

06:28.861 --> 06:30.195
You fool.

06:31.071 --> 06:32.114
You good?

06:34.783 --> 06:36.744
You didn't pick the winning team.

06:36.785 --> 06:39.872
You're working
with the two biggest clowns.

06:40.372 --> 06:41.373
My advice,

06:42.082 --> 06:44.710
do night shifts,
join the elite force.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.545
Know why you ride nights?

06:47.796 --> 06:48.964
You know?

06:49.006 --> 06:50.549
Cuz you the ugliest.

06:51.008 --> 06:52.635
Know who else rides?

06:55.846 --> 06:58.682
Don't bother calling me!

06:58.724 --> 07:01.185
You keep him. He drives me crazy...

07:01.644 --> 07:03.520
He drives me crazy, get it?

07:03.771 --> 07:06.023
If you had kids, you'd get it.

07:06.065 --> 07:08.484
I keep telling him, over and over.

07:08.525 --> 07:11.320
He messes up, he's on his own now!

07:11.362 --> 07:12.780
What did he do now?

07:13.530 --> 07:15.491
Stole a bag full of hens.

07:17.409 --> 07:18.619
Live chickens?

07:18.661 --> 07:19.662
That's right.

07:19.703 --> 07:23.040
From a gypsy who turned his garage
into a chicken coop.

07:23.332 --> 07:24.708
To sell or eat?

07:25.376 --> 07:26.961
What do I know?

07:27.378 --> 07:29.088
He doesn't care about anything.

07:29.129 --> 07:30.422
You hear me?

07:40.140 --> 07:41.517
Set yourself up over there.

07:43.644 --> 07:45.479
Nice pig collection.

07:48.065 --> 07:51.151
"Pink Pig", that's his nickname
and he's proud of it.

07:51.193 --> 07:52.778
100% swine!

08:00.744 --> 08:02.705
So, not gonna miss the cows?

08:03.455 --> 08:04.581
What?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.084
- The cows.
- No, why?

08:07.543 --> 08:09.253
You from the countryside?

08:10.546 --> 08:12.298
No, not gonna miss it.

08:13.173 --> 08:14.800
New beginnings for you.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.344
You never served with the SCU?

08:18.595 --> 08:21.473
I was a first responder,
then trained with the SCU.

08:26.353 --> 08:28.187
So why did you come here?

08:28.563 --> 08:31.358
My ex, also a cop,
was transferred.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.903
She has custody of our son
and I want see him more,

08:34.944 --> 08:36.488
so I followed her.

08:36.530 --> 08:37.573
That's why.

08:39.783 --> 08:41.118
Don't start!

08:44.079 --> 08:45.372
My favorite read.

08:49.251 --> 08:50.085
<i>Shit life</i>

08:51.211 --> 08:53.047
The backstreet boys!

08:54.506 --> 08:55.841
The matriarch.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.509
Corporal Ruiz.

08:57.551 --> 08:59.762
Captain Chandier, pleasure.

08:59.803 --> 09:01.847
- Treating you well?
- Great.

09:02.139 --> 09:03.182
Perfect.

09:03.223 --> 09:06.226
35ọC forecast for today.
Apply sunscreen.

09:07.227 --> 09:08.312
Well, well.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.398
Family's growing.

09:12.524 --> 09:15.444
30ọC, people would be on the streets,

09:15.486 --> 09:17.613
hanging out, it'd be chaos.

09:17.655 --> 09:20.115
But 35ọC is perfect, they stay in...

09:20.574 --> 09:21.909
and rest.

09:23.285 --> 09:24.912
Smooth.

09:26.789 --> 09:28.082
You shave?

09:29.458 --> 09:30.876
I kept my baby skin.

09:32.294 --> 09:34.421
I'm jealous.

09:34.463 --> 09:37.883
Let's enjoy the victory
while everyone's happy.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.427
Corporal, see me in my office.

09:41.220 --> 09:44.515
France is on its cloud nine.
Chris, come too.

09:49.812 --> 09:52.648
Chris is your unit sergeant.

09:53.065 --> 09:55.859
He has solid field experience.

09:55.901 --> 09:57.361
He's...

09:58.278 --> 10:00.072
Let's see...

10:00.114 --> 10:03.075
What would you say?
Sharp, reactive?

10:04.118 --> 10:06.161
Goes overboard sometimes?

10:07.329 --> 10:09.832
You can't be shy around here.

10:10.374 --> 10:14.670
Know that I don't approve
of inappropriate behavior.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.089
- Understood?
- Absolutely.

10:17.131 --> 10:17.965
Good.

10:18.382 --> 10:21.885
I appeal to your sense of duty,
Corporal Ruiz.

10:21.927 --> 10:24.680
Your team spirit. Solidarity.

10:24.722 --> 10:26.724
No solidarity, no team.

10:27.558 --> 10:29.518
No team, we are alone.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.145
Alone against...

10:33.480 --> 10:35.733
What would you say, Chris?

10:36.734 --> 10:38.027
The brutality of our world.

10:39.737 --> 10:42.114
I couldn't have said it better.

10:43.574 --> 10:45.492
Dismissed.

10:46.201 --> 10:47.286
Greaser,

10:47.328 --> 10:49.663
sit in the back.
Eyes open, mouth shut.

10:49.705 --> 10:51.540
Can we lose the nickname?

10:51.582 --> 10:53.917
Greaser. Told you to zip it.

11:24.365 --> 11:26.200
Beat it! You stink.

11:26.241 --> 11:27.660
Watch your mouth.

11:27.701 --> 11:28.494
Sorry, Pop.

11:28.535 --> 11:30.079
Out of bed now!

11:30.120 --> 11:31.538
I'm on vacation!

11:31.580 --> 11:34.750
Don't argue, vacation or not.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.168
Get up now.

11:51.517 --> 11:53.143
Watch it. Riot Police.

11:57.564 --> 11:59.316
Running away from us?

11:59.358 --> 12:02.069
Young brothers, little food for thought.

12:02.903 --> 12:03.988
Right?

12:04.029 --> 12:07.116
Success now and beyond depends on Allah

12:07.157 --> 12:09.076
and Mohammed's path.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.036
We, Muslim Brothers,

12:11.078 --> 12:13.163
are here to talk. <i>Bismilah.</i>

12:13.414 --> 12:16.291
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i> young brothers.
Y'all okay?

12:17.251 --> 12:21.964
We came today to discuss complaints
regarding your behavior.

12:22.339 --> 12:26.552
At the mosque,
your neighbors complain about you.

12:26.885 --> 12:29.763
In Islam, one's behavior
is very important.

12:30.681 --> 12:33.392
Towards yourselves, your elders, us,

12:33.809 --> 12:37.062
your parents, and your neighbors.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.856
Especially your neighbors.

12:38.897 --> 12:41.108
You must respect your elders,

12:41.150 --> 12:43.694
and most of all mothers and fathers.

12:44.361 --> 12:45.404
Understood?

12:45.446 --> 12:46.238
Yes.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.573
We can count on you?

12:48.324 --> 12:50.159
After the prayer, <i>inshallah,</i>

12:50.200 --> 12:52.411
join us at the mosque for a snack.

12:52.453 --> 12:55.873
Cake, candies, soft drinks...

12:55.914 --> 12:57.458
and a little class.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.377
Does that work for you guys?

13:00.419 --> 13:01.670
Are we good?

13:02.963 --> 13:04.298
Alright little brothers.

14:12.491 --> 14:14.576
See the guy at the bus stop?

14:14.618 --> 14:15.494
That one.

14:16.912 --> 14:18.789
Looks normal, right?

14:20.040 --> 14:21.875
He's a threat to national security.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.253
His beard used to be that long.

14:25.671 --> 14:27.923
Spent three years in Syria
beheading people.

14:29.591 --> 14:31.969
A Quran and an AK on him at all times.

14:35.139 --> 14:36.932
See that guy with the cap?

14:38.058 --> 14:39.935
Don't stare! You crazy?

14:39.977 --> 14:42.479
He threw his chatty wife
out the window.

14:43.605 --> 14:45.566
Thankfully she survived.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.988
Illegals over there.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.032
So cholera, typhus...

14:54.408 --> 14:56.535
Always wear gloves.
You never know.

14:58.162 --> 15:00.748
One of the boys caught tetanus
while frisking.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.750
You fucking with me?

15:04.752 --> 15:06.128
Greaser...

15:07.671 --> 15:08.922
Fun cultural fact.

15:09.423 --> 15:11.508
Know why the school's called
Victor Hugo?

15:12.551 --> 15:14.595
He wrote <i>Les Misérables</i> here.

15:16.221 --> 15:18.724
We got a brain on board.

15:21.352 --> 15:22.603
You read the novel?

15:22.645 --> 15:24.563
I saw it on the town's website.

15:26.398 --> 15:28.984
Things haven't changed much.

15:30.027 --> 15:32.780
Except that Gavroche is now "Gavaracha".

15:33.155 --> 15:34.782
"Gavaracha, come herr."

15:35.240 --> 15:36.325
"Right now."

15:37.743 --> 15:39.745
Cosette is now "Coozette".

15:39.787 --> 15:41.872
Her mom works at the post office.

15:41.914 --> 15:44.041
Always tired...

15:44.625 --> 15:45.918
She works too much.

15:46.835 --> 15:48.170
Coozette...

15:54.176 --> 15:55.469
Check out Owl.

15:56.637 --> 15:58.305
What up, scoundrels?

15:58.347 --> 15:59.974
Owl, they let you out?

16:00.015 --> 16:01.850
It was about time.

16:01.892 --> 16:03.143
How long were you in?

16:03.185 --> 16:04.436
Four years.

16:05.479 --> 16:07.231
We put you in, remember?

16:07.272 --> 16:10.651
Can't forget your face,
I don't like it.

16:10.693 --> 16:12.736
No choice. Just doing our job.

16:13.237 --> 16:14.738
Can't change job?

16:14.780 --> 16:16.824
No. You pretty in that suit.

16:16.865 --> 16:18.659
Looking for a job.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.828
Really? What kind of job?

16:20.869 --> 16:23.539
Landscaping, trimming, pruning...

16:23.580 --> 16:24.373
Okay.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.041
- It rhymes.
- Right.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.461
- You still rap?
- Always, but no trap.

16:29.503 --> 16:31.839
Give us some bars, old school.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.466
<i>Pull trigger, tension bigger</i>

16:34.508 --> 16:36.385
<i>Check my take, state mistake</i>

16:36.427 --> 16:38.971
<i>Politics reprobate, riots create</i>

16:39.596 --> 16:43.392
<i>Misdemeanor at stake
Just the son of an expatriate</i>

16:43.434 --> 16:46.478
<i>State won't renovate
my building, district</i>

16:46.520 --> 16:49.440
<i>Change my ways if that's all it takes</i>

16:49.481 --> 16:50.524
District 93.

16:50.566 --> 16:52.401
- Sounds nice.
- Not bad?

16:52.443 --> 16:55.487
- Wise words you speak.
- Right.

16:56.405 --> 16:58.699
You still need to get a job though.

16:58.741 --> 16:59.532
Of course.

16:59.575 --> 17:01.409
- Your rap is...
- The bomb!

17:03.078 --> 17:05.122
You alright, Owl. Good luck.

17:05.163 --> 17:06.457
Same to you.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.834
Wow, it got to him.

17:08.876 --> 17:10.168
Prison killed him.

17:10.210 --> 17:11.712
An old client.

17:12.545 --> 17:15.173
50 bucks I collar him within six months.

17:34.610 --> 17:35.986
I'll buy you a drink.

17:36.028 --> 17:38.155
Hey, Kirikou!

17:41.742 --> 17:42.701
He keeps at it!

17:42.743 --> 17:44.328
He wants to go to the ER.

17:44.370 --> 17:46.163
He's headed there.

17:46.205 --> 17:49.249
He will, his head's about to bleed.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.710
I forgot to tell you.

17:51.752 --> 17:53.128
When I was back home,

17:53.170 --> 17:56.131
with my family, in my village...

17:56.173 --> 17:57.925
I was falling asleep.

17:57.967 --> 18:01.720
I heard a noise,
a guy tried to steal a scooter.

18:01.762 --> 18:04.974
- No scooters in the bush.
- Of course there are!

18:05.015 --> 18:06.517
Come on, shut up.

18:06.558 --> 18:09.728
Some guys grabbed him.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.689
I was in shock.
They held him down.

18:11.730 --> 18:14.400
Tied him up and set him on fire.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.526
Traumatizing.

18:15.567 --> 18:16.944
Come on...

18:17.861 --> 18:19.029
Swear to Allah.

18:20.489 --> 18:22.116
They burned him alive.

18:22.157 --> 18:24.618
You know how dust blows away?

18:24.660 --> 18:26.036
Same with his ashes.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.623
Crazy dangerous over there.

18:29.665 --> 18:32.459
You get caught stealing, you die.

18:37.798 --> 18:39.008
Told ya so!

18:39.591 --> 18:40.426
What's up?

18:41.135 --> 18:43.262
- How you boys doing?
- Good.

18:43.929 --> 18:46.098
Looking nice.
What can I get you?

18:48.934 --> 18:50.102
Tortillas...

18:50.144 --> 18:53.397
1 panini, 2 grilled cheeses, 2 cokes

18:53.439 --> 18:55.733
- 1 hamburger.
- 1 snickers.

18:55.774 --> 18:57.735
- 2 corns.
- Wait.

18:57.776 --> 18:59.194
That's a big order.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.489
How much you got?

19:02.531 --> 19:03.741
12 euros.

19:03.782 --> 19:05.034
- How much?
- 12 euros.

19:05.075 --> 19:07.578
Not gonna happen.
Go away.

19:07.953 --> 19:09.747
We played sport, we're hungry.

19:11.332 --> 19:12.666
Out of here, scram.

19:14.627 --> 19:17.129
- Come on, Uncle.
- No good.

19:18.672 --> 19:19.632
Goodbye.

19:25.679 --> 19:29.141
<i>Join the circus
and watch international talents.</i>

19:29.183 --> 19:32.645
<i>Acrobats, jugglers, wild animals...</i>

19:32.686 --> 19:35.064
Maybe they'll hire you as a clown.

19:36.190 --> 19:37.524
You're a funny guy.

19:40.402 --> 19:41.737
Look at that.

19:42.988 --> 19:44.615
Let's inspect them.

19:45.366 --> 19:46.659
What did they do?

19:46.700 --> 19:48.952
Wake up, fellows! I smell smoke.

19:48.994 --> 19:50.037
Gwada, U-turn.

19:50.704 --> 19:53.666
<i>Let's palpate...</i>

19:54.083 --> 19:56.251
<i>I'll frisk you</i>

19:57.044 --> 19:59.463
<i>With passion</i>

20:00.798 --> 20:02.132
Gun it.

20:03.634 --> 20:05.260
Let's pop Greaser's cherry.

20:26.031 --> 20:27.241
Hello ladies.

20:28.534 --> 20:29.743
Police check.

20:31.286 --> 20:32.329
What you doing?

20:32.371 --> 20:33.497
Waiting for the bus.

20:33.539 --> 20:34.832
- What?
- Waiting for the bus.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.293
Really?

20:41.672 --> 20:42.840
That yours?

20:50.347 --> 20:51.432
How old are you?

20:51.682 --> 20:52.725
Fifteen.

20:52.766 --> 20:53.934
Fifteen?

20:53.976 --> 20:55.519
And you already smoke?

20:59.523 --> 21:00.691
Smells like hash.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.653
Where'd you hide it?

21:05.070 --> 21:05.988
You have no right!

21:06.363 --> 21:08.157
I do what I want. Where is it?

21:08.198 --> 21:09.074
You have no right!

21:09.116 --> 21:12.494
State of emergency,
I can stick a finger up your ass.

21:12.536 --> 21:13.787
- Sir.
- Shut up!

21:13.829 --> 21:14.747
You have no right.

21:14.788 --> 21:17.541
- Want me to arrest you?
- You have no right!

21:17.583 --> 21:19.126
- Leave it.
- I'll handle it.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.130
Where's it from?
Want me to keep looking?

21:23.797 --> 21:24.632
What's that?

21:24.673 --> 21:26.050
You're breaking the law.

21:26.091 --> 21:27.051
Stop filming!

21:30.095 --> 21:31.305
Happy now?

21:31.805 --> 21:32.640
Bitch!

21:33.599 --> 21:34.892
Beat it!

21:34.933 --> 21:36.393
Quit smoking. It's bad for you.

22:08.759 --> 22:09.551
Buzz!

22:09.593 --> 22:11.178
Get your ass over here.

22:14.348 --> 22:16.141
You filmed me in my room?

22:16.183 --> 22:17.059
No, I swear.

22:17.101 --> 22:19.061
It wasn't your drone at my window?

22:19.645 --> 22:21.563
Didn't know you were home.

22:21.605 --> 22:23.399
Give me your phone.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.359
Give it! Hurry, Buzz!

22:29.989 --> 22:31.657
You filmed all the girls?

22:33.325 --> 22:35.411
You're a real pervert.

22:35.452 --> 22:36.412
I'm shocked.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.627
Oh shit, he filmed Salimata!

22:44.420 --> 22:46.922
That hoe, check it out.

22:46.964 --> 22:48.382
She's pathetic.

22:48.424 --> 22:50.592
Send it to me.
I'll put her on blast.

22:50.634 --> 22:51.593
Me too.

22:51.635 --> 22:53.178
What a hoe!

22:53.595 --> 22:56.181
If you ever try to film me,

22:56.432 --> 22:57.641
I'll fuck you up.

22:58.183 --> 22:59.184
You'd better not.

22:59.226 --> 23:00.811
Send me this video

23:00.853 --> 23:03.022
and delete the others, got it?

23:04.189 --> 23:05.524
What you doing tomorrow?

23:05.566 --> 23:06.400
Nothing.

23:07.192 --> 23:08.027
Nothing.

23:08.485 --> 23:10.696
We got a basketball game at ten.

23:11.113 --> 23:12.823
- Can you come?
- Sure.

23:12.865 --> 23:14.158
You gonna film the game.

23:14.199 --> 23:15.034
Okay.

23:15.075 --> 23:16.243
- Speak up.
- Okay.

23:16.285 --> 23:17.536
Counting on you.

23:17.578 --> 23:19.163
You'd better be there, Buzz.

23:19.997 --> 23:21.415
- Got it?
- Yes.

23:22.333 --> 23:23.500
Let's go, girls.

23:42.436 --> 23:43.562
Jojo. My buddy.

23:44.647 --> 23:45.814
The boys in blue!

23:45.856 --> 23:47.232
- What up?
- Chilling.

23:47.274 --> 23:48.567
What's good with y'all?

23:48.609 --> 23:50.277
Grilling under the sun.

23:50.319 --> 23:51.195
For us?

23:51.236 --> 23:52.112
Want a steak?

23:52.821 --> 23:53.781
Tell me.

23:53.822 --> 23:55.824
We're good. Already ate.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.494
- Okay.
- Be safe now.

23:59.662 --> 24:00.996
Same to you.

24:01.038 --> 24:02.206
Later, Jojo.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.793
Fellas, almost done!

24:09.254 --> 24:10.673
What's with the vests?

24:10.965 --> 24:12.967
They work for the mayor.

24:13.717 --> 24:16.720
When elevators break down,
they bring up groceries

24:16.762 --> 24:19.807
with fishing lines, like in prison.

24:21.475 --> 24:22.434
Anyway...

24:22.768 --> 24:24.603
It's good the mayor does that.

24:25.187 --> 24:26.981
We gotta pay him a visit.

24:27.022 --> 24:27.856
That prick?

24:30.067 --> 24:31.318
Why is he a prick?

24:31.777 --> 24:33.112
The mayor's a prick?

24:33.821 --> 24:35.656
That retard you just saw?

24:36.156 --> 24:37.574
He's the mayor's brother.

24:38.951 --> 24:40.035
The mayor's black?

24:40.452 --> 24:41.453
Yup.

24:42.997 --> 24:44.456
Our very own Obama.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.627
You spoke to the Paki?

24:48.669 --> 24:50.254
Yup, all good.

24:50.296 --> 24:52.214
Starting to bust my balls.

24:52.256 --> 24:53.340
He's alright.

24:53.382 --> 24:57.011
Last time I saw him,
he was talking slick.

24:57.052 --> 24:59.763
And the new fruit vendor.

24:59.805 --> 25:00.973
The new guy?

25:01.015 --> 25:02.349
He's a softie.

25:02.391 --> 25:03.225
Good.

25:03.642 --> 25:05.102
He'll get the Ballon d'Or.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.147
The young Mbappé?

25:09.189 --> 25:11.150
No. Modric will get it.

25:12.735 --> 25:14.069
Not certain.

25:14.528 --> 25:16.238
Mbappé...

25:16.780 --> 25:18.699
He's in another galaxy.

25:20.117 --> 25:21.160
He's a mirage.

25:21.744 --> 25:23.287
See that, all fake.

25:24.204 --> 25:25.331
Knock-offs...

25:27.333 --> 25:29.418
- I can prove it's not.
- Real fake, then?

25:29.460 --> 25:30.919
This one's not bad.

25:31.337 --> 25:32.838
Partial fake.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.673
Half fake, half real?

25:34.715 --> 25:36.467
- I have invoices.
- Really?

25:36.508 --> 25:37.718
How much?

25:37.760 --> 25:39.303
35 euros.

25:39.345 --> 25:41.305
Word? Can I borrow money?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.557
You extended your stand?

25:44.600 --> 25:46.477
Thanks, have a nice day.

25:47.311 --> 25:48.812
How much? 9 yards?

25:51.315 --> 25:54.318
Come on ladies, take advantage.

25:54.902 --> 25:56.362
Everything's on sale.

25:56.403 --> 25:57.863
Here's 22.

25:57.905 --> 26:01.075
For real, an ice cream truck
would be great.

26:01.116 --> 26:02.743
Instant success.

26:03.369 --> 26:06.830
For people here, not 5,
but 1-euro ice creams.

26:07.247 --> 26:08.540
Plus our tax.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.794
Kids would like that.

26:12.169 --> 26:14.588
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

26:15.089 --> 26:16.173
Went well today?

26:16.215 --> 26:18.342
Aside from Amar acting out.

26:18.384 --> 26:20.636
Gonna take care of that guy.

26:20.678 --> 26:22.471
Let him act a fool.

26:23.597 --> 26:25.683
- Alright, brothers.
- Peace.

26:27.476 --> 26:29.144
Look who's coming.

26:29.186 --> 26:33.190
Can't stand that ugly motherfucker.

26:34.149 --> 26:36.193
Mr Mayor, how are things?

26:36.235 --> 26:37.611
Not good, brother.

26:38.070 --> 26:41.907
If Amar keeps busting my balls,
gonna kick him out.

26:42.449 --> 26:43.367
What did he do?

26:43.409 --> 26:46.870
I keep telling him.
He takes up too much room.

26:47.454 --> 26:48.622
Want me to talk to him?

26:48.664 --> 26:51.458
Up to you.
Or I'll handle it my way.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.626
Handle what?

26:53.002 --> 26:55.004
That's our job, not yours.

26:55.045 --> 26:56.588
Talk to him, please.

26:56.630 --> 26:59.425
Handle your detergent,
fake jerseys and watermelons.

26:59.466 --> 27:01.510
Fall back.

27:01.552 --> 27:03.429
Not gonna introduce us?

27:04.596 --> 27:06.557
- Introduce yourself.
- Gentlemen.

27:07.933 --> 27:08.767
Hello.

27:09.143 --> 27:10.769
Go on, don't be shy.

27:11.145 --> 27:12.146
Hello.

27:13.272 --> 27:14.732
What's your name?

27:15.190 --> 27:16.567
Corporal Ruiz.

27:17.526 --> 27:19.695
- Nice to meet you, Ruiz.
- Pleasure.

27:20.738 --> 27:23.324
Don't look at me. He's talking to you.

27:23.365 --> 27:25.826
Leave the new guy alone.

27:25.868 --> 27:27.911
He won't last long.

27:27.953 --> 27:30.789
You checked for what I asked for?
That thing?

27:31.206 --> 27:33.417
Seeing my cousin later.

27:33.459 --> 27:35.252
I don't want fake shit.

27:35.294 --> 27:38.505
When did I ever give you fake shit?

27:39.089 --> 27:40.924
In its original box. For my wife.

27:41.884 --> 27:43.886
"Ever give you fake shit?"

27:44.178 --> 27:45.220
Shut your trap!

27:45.471 --> 27:46.805
Have a nice day.

27:46.847 --> 27:47.848
Gentlemen.

27:48.766 --> 27:49.975
Red Power Ranger!

27:50.017 --> 27:51.393
Where are the others?

27:52.811 --> 27:54.772
That bum ass.

27:55.189 --> 27:57.441
Matter of time before I fuck'm up.

27:57.483 --> 28:00.444
That's what he wants.
Don't fall for it.

28:00.486 --> 28:04.323
Don't say that.
I'm just supposed to stand here?

28:04.365 --> 28:05.699
Who do you think I am?

28:07.159 --> 28:08.118
Seriously?

28:08.160 --> 28:09.912
He treats me like shit.

28:09.953 --> 28:11.997
You a career counselor now?

28:12.039 --> 28:13.666
Just do your job!

28:25.219 --> 28:26.428
Amar,

28:26.470 --> 28:27.471
my friend!

28:28.305 --> 28:29.306
What's up?

28:33.060 --> 28:35.729
You know what's up,
you're gonna lose your stand

28:36.063 --> 28:37.439
if you keep spreading out.

28:37.898 --> 28:39.149
What are we gonna do?

28:39.900 --> 28:42.653
Like Miss France,
all I want is world peace.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.572
No beef. How can we solve this?

28:45.614 --> 28:48.492
I pay for every inch,
this thug wants more.

28:48.909 --> 28:50.536
You know the drill.

28:50.577 --> 28:52.871
I haven't even made 20,
he wants 50.

28:53.414 --> 28:54.540
Who's the crook?

28:54.581 --> 28:55.958
<i>Fucking queers!</i>

28:56.000 --> 28:58.252
<i>Will bleed you to death!</i>

28:58.294 --> 28:59.253
<i>Give him back!</i>

28:59.670 --> 29:02.506
<i>If not, gonna crucify you!</i>

29:02.548 --> 29:04.633
<i>Gonna crucify y'all faggots!</i>

29:05.718 --> 29:06.969
Let's go.

29:07.720 --> 29:08.762
This way.

29:11.098 --> 29:12.141
<i>...cut your balls.</i>

29:12.182 --> 29:14.393
<i>Break your legs, motherfuckers!</i>

29:14.893 --> 29:16.228
<i>Bitches!</i>

29:16.270 --> 29:19.898
<i>Gonna burn your faggot hood!</i>

29:20.232 --> 29:23.569
Whoever stole Johnny,
gonna eat shit

29:23.610 --> 29:26.530
and the brain of its corpse.

29:26.572 --> 29:30.034
Something happens to him,
he doesn't come back

29:30.075 --> 29:32.119
we'll kill you, dead faggots!

29:32.161 --> 29:33.329
Eat your brains!

29:33.370 --> 29:35.539
Cut your balls off,
eat your ancestors.

29:35.873 --> 29:37.291
Look around.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.918
Put him in the truck first.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.587
What does he look like?

29:41.629 --> 29:43.964
He had a black jersey.

29:44.256 --> 29:45.799
Can't see him anymore.

29:45.841 --> 29:47.426
They're all black here.

29:47.468 --> 29:50.095
Spot him and I bust his head open!

29:50.137 --> 29:51.096
That isn't him?

29:51.138 --> 29:52.181
Nah.

29:52.222 --> 29:54.266
All black in this shit hood.

29:54.642 --> 29:56.644
Do a U-turn at the next block.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.193
Gypsies. Never a good sign.

30:10.741 --> 30:12.368
Wrong highway exit.

30:12.409 --> 30:14.870
Mayor, they look suspect.

30:14.912 --> 30:15.913
What's going on?

30:21.627 --> 30:23.045
Hey guys. What's up?

30:23.087 --> 30:26.465
Yeah, all good.
Just gonna have a chat.

30:26.507 --> 30:28.133
Got a few questions.

30:29.051 --> 30:30.803
What's with the sticks?

30:30.844 --> 30:33.681
Gimme a sec.
I've come for my Johnny.

30:33.722 --> 30:35.599
What d'you mean, gypsy?

30:35.641 --> 30:37.184
Calm down, I'll explain.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.352
I'm calm, man.

30:38.394 --> 30:41.855
They came to my circus
and swiped my Johnny.

30:41.897 --> 30:43.399
What you talking about?

30:43.440 --> 30:44.775
Kidnapped my Johnny.

30:45.401 --> 30:46.944
They swiped him.

30:46.986 --> 30:48.904
I bottle fed him. He like a son.

30:49.488 --> 30:50.948
He's in the projects.

30:50.990 --> 30:52.783
Look for him, here, there.

30:52.825 --> 30:54.326
I don't get it.

30:54.368 --> 30:56.620
- Not here to start shit.
- Me neither.

30:56.662 --> 30:58.205
Do I know your Johnny?

30:58.247 --> 30:59.415
Don't need to.

30:59.456 --> 31:01.000
But I don't know him!

31:01.041 --> 31:02.626
Gonna fuck them up!

31:02.918 --> 31:04.628
Burn them to a crisp!

31:04.670 --> 31:06.547
Calm down, gypsy!

31:06.588 --> 31:07.381
Find him!

31:07.423 --> 31:09.216
- You know him?
- The singer?

31:09.258 --> 31:10.092
He's dead.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.177
One of your guys took him.

31:12.428 --> 31:14.096
You know Johnny?

31:14.888 --> 31:16.098
It's him!

31:16.140 --> 31:18.767
It's you!

31:18.809 --> 31:20.561
Who? I'ma fuck you up.

31:20.602 --> 31:22.021
Go for it.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.358
You're gonna find him!

31:27.234 --> 31:28.944
Where are the Gypsy Kings?

31:31.113 --> 31:32.740
There, on the left.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.575
Do a U-turn.

31:35.659 --> 31:36.827
Well done, Greaser.

31:45.878 --> 31:47.630
We need backup.

31:47.671 --> 31:49.006
We'll handle it.

31:49.048 --> 31:49.965
Calm down.

31:53.927 --> 31:54.928
What's happening?

31:54.970 --> 31:56.930
Back up. Back up!

31:56.972 --> 31:59.099
Back up. Back up!

32:03.520 --> 32:06.023
Calm down!
What's going on?

32:06.440 --> 32:08.233
Good you're here.

32:08.275 --> 32:10.277
You're gonna settle the score.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.529
- Calm down.
- They swiped my Johnny.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.990
They came and stole him.

32:15.032 --> 32:17.826
They kidnapped one of your guys?

32:19.078 --> 32:20.704
Johnny's my lion cub.

32:22.581 --> 32:24.166
I want him back.

32:25.084 --> 32:26.543
Someone stole a lion?

32:28.128 --> 32:30.214
They stole my lion cub.

32:30.255 --> 32:32.841
Who saw what?
You saw something?

32:32.883 --> 32:35.219
He saw. Come here Chino.

32:35.719 --> 32:38.180
A little nigga took the lion
to the projects!

32:38.764 --> 32:40.432
I'll make him fuck his ancestors!

32:40.474 --> 32:42.142
I'll cut off his legs!

32:42.184 --> 32:43.644
- What?
- Calm down.

32:43.686 --> 32:45.020
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

32:45.062 --> 32:45.896
A lil' nigga.

32:46.230 --> 32:47.773
I got it!

32:47.815 --> 32:49.024
Black jersey.

32:49.066 --> 32:49.858
Calm down!

32:49.900 --> 32:50.985
He crazy?

32:51.443 --> 32:52.236
Mayor.

32:52.277 --> 32:54.571
You got 24 hours to find him.

32:54.613 --> 32:56.865
Or I'll be back with a shotgun.

32:56.907 --> 32:58.867
- You old cunt!
- Shut up!

32:59.493 --> 33:00.828
Step back, step back.

33:06.959 --> 33:08.085
Get back.

33:10.587 --> 33:12.131
Son of a bitch.

33:17.052 --> 33:18.304
Step away!

33:20.597 --> 33:23.475
Zorro, take your boys and go.

33:23.517 --> 33:25.436
Let's go.

33:26.061 --> 33:27.104
Slut!

33:29.273 --> 33:30.190
All good.

33:30.232 --> 33:31.567
We'll bring him back.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.360
We'll find him.

33:35.154 --> 33:36.322
Man up, pussy!

33:36.697 --> 33:38.907
I'll take care of it. Go now.

33:42.244 --> 33:43.370
Motherfucker!

33:43.412 --> 33:44.288
Let them bark.

33:44.330 --> 33:46.165
You serious?

33:46.206 --> 33:48.334
Our parents are watching.

33:48.375 --> 33:51.045
- You crazy?
- Let's go into your office.

33:51.295 --> 33:53.922
Thought it was his son, not a lion!

33:53.964 --> 33:57.134
Some real drama.
You fucking serious?

33:57.176 --> 33:58.510
What's up with that?

33:58.552 --> 34:00.304
If they come back,

34:00.346 --> 34:02.806
bullets will fly.

34:02.848 --> 34:03.932
You hear me?

34:03.974 --> 34:06.685
I'll take care of them. Calm down.

34:06.727 --> 34:08.187
Now, do me a favor.

34:08.228 --> 34:10.230
Scope around and find the lion.

34:10.272 --> 34:12.608
- What do I get out of it?
- What do you get?

34:12.650 --> 34:15.694
Them not returning, guns blazing.

34:15.736 --> 34:17.488
Mothers mourning.

34:17.529 --> 34:18.864
Bullshit.

34:18.906 --> 34:21.116
Control the kids. It's your job!

34:21.158 --> 34:22.368
Shut your mouth.

34:22.409 --> 34:23.577
You threatening me?

34:23.619 --> 34:25.329
C'mon, calm down.

34:25.371 --> 34:26.872
Shut the fuck up.

34:26.914 --> 34:28.457
- Calm down.
- Asshole.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.210
No fucks given.

34:31.251 --> 34:33.671
Seriously, I don't give a fuck.

34:33.712 --> 34:35.422
They can come back.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.883
Burn down the block. I don't care.

34:37.925 --> 34:40.761
City hall will pay me
to calm the kids.

34:40.803 --> 34:41.762
Cry me a river.

34:41.804 --> 34:43.055
Knock it off!

34:43.097 --> 34:44.765
'The fuck you talking about?

34:45.474 --> 34:46.308
Seriously.

34:46.850 --> 34:48.185
Do as I say.

34:51.730 --> 34:53.107
Alright, you got it.

34:53.607 --> 34:54.566
Only cuz it's you.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.235
Counting on you.

34:56.652 --> 34:57.444
We're out.

34:57.486 --> 34:58.737
Bozo.

34:58.779 --> 35:02.074
What do you want?
What you looking at?

35:02.116 --> 35:02.992
Wanna suck it?

35:03.033 --> 35:03.993
Beat it!

35:04.034 --> 35:05.995
Ladies, enjoy your day.

35:06.578 --> 35:07.746
Asshole.

35:11.417 --> 35:12.501
Mayor.

35:12.543 --> 35:13.877
Macha.

35:13.919 --> 35:15.379
See how they treat us?

35:15.421 --> 35:16.630
Too confident.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.382
It's over.

35:18.424 --> 35:20.426
They need us
more than we need them.

35:21.468 --> 35:23.512
Fuck their stupid lion.

35:27.599 --> 35:28.809
We're not animal control.

35:28.851 --> 35:29.977
Who cares?

35:30.519 --> 35:32.229
Tase him and it's a done deal.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.481
So where do we start?

35:35.858 --> 35:38.485
Start with Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat.

35:40.195 --> 35:41.113
Why?

35:41.530 --> 35:42.990
They're dummies.

35:43.032 --> 35:45.826
They can't help bragging
on social media.

35:56.211 --> 35:57.338
Greaser!

35:57.630 --> 35:58.881
Quit wanking.

35:59.173 --> 36:00.007
You shy?

36:01.425 --> 36:02.259
Not really.

36:03.677 --> 36:04.720
First mission.

36:05.262 --> 36:06.722
You walk in there.

36:07.097 --> 36:09.600
Greet everyone politely,

36:09.975 --> 36:11.518
and ask for Salah.

36:12.353 --> 36:13.145
Okay?

36:13.187 --> 36:15.356
He knows everything and everyone.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.650
See if he saw a kid with a mini-lion.

36:19.151 --> 36:20.277
Get it Greaser?

36:21.820 --> 36:23.280
They won't bite.

36:35.459 --> 36:36.835
His armband.

36:53.894 --> 36:55.145
Gentlemen.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.443
I was hoping to speak to Salah.

37:01.694 --> 37:02.695
Is he around?

37:07.491 --> 37:08.367
Anyone?

37:15.916 --> 37:16.875
Hello.

37:20.421 --> 37:21.630
My colleagues...

37:27.094 --> 37:29.930
They thought you could help us
regarding a theft.

37:33.642 --> 37:36.395
What information
are your colleagues seeking?

37:39.148 --> 37:42.401
A lion cub was stolen from a circus.

37:42.443 --> 37:45.070
The circus owners...

37:45.529 --> 37:47.239
want to get it back.

37:48.782 --> 37:52.202
They suspect a local kid,
an individual of African descent.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.044
Maybe you, or someone here

38:01.045 --> 38:02.713
heard or saw

38:03.005 --> 38:05.132
something related to the lion.

38:10.763 --> 38:12.973
Does a lion belong in a circus?

38:15.309 --> 38:17.936
In Islam, this majestic animal

38:17.978 --> 38:19.897
embodies force and power.

38:20.356 --> 38:23.192
Man shouldn't cage such a wise creature.

38:27.488 --> 38:28.947
Agreed but...

38:31.325 --> 38:34.161
It'd be best to return it to its owner.

38:34.203 --> 38:36.205
A lion cub is vulnerable.

38:36.497 --> 38:38.707
It needs to be cared for and fed.

38:38.749 --> 38:41.126
Since when do men need to feed lions?

38:41.168 --> 38:42.962
Don't they hunt on their own?

38:43.003 --> 38:44.046
Feed themselves?

38:45.422 --> 38:47.925
Men create unnatural constraints.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.219
That is servitude.

38:51.971 --> 38:54.223
What does a lion say when it roars?

38:56.850 --> 38:58.143
O Allah!

38:59.770 --> 39:03.023
May he who is benevolent
be protected from my claws.

39:16.662 --> 39:17.955
Eat in peace.

39:19.248 --> 39:20.791
On the house.

39:48.485 --> 39:49.695
Greaser.

39:53.115 --> 39:54.074
So?

39:54.450 --> 39:55.659
Very funny.

39:56.910 --> 39:58.912
So I got a free kebab.

40:03.417 --> 40:04.627
Who's Salah?

40:05.210 --> 40:08.547
An ex-thug who grew a beard.
He calls the shots.

40:09.214 --> 40:11.133
We got a lot of dirt on him.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.718
He was a big fish.

40:15.054 --> 40:16.305
You learn anything?

40:17.514 --> 40:18.974
Absolutely nothing.

40:23.854 --> 40:26.106
Issa, what you doing here?

40:27.983 --> 40:29.109
What's that?

40:29.610 --> 40:31.737
Your dad doesn't want you
to come home.

40:32.446 --> 40:33.822
Where you gonna go?

40:36.784 --> 40:38.118
What did Mom say?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.162
She's tired of arguing with him.

40:41.163 --> 40:42.915
She wants you to come home.

40:42.956 --> 40:43.999
Really?

40:44.249 --> 40:45.084
Yeah.

40:46.168 --> 40:47.378
What's in there?

40:50.047 --> 40:52.967
You crazy! Don't bring that back home!

40:53.008 --> 40:54.551
I'm talking to you.

40:54.593 --> 40:55.552
Issa!

40:58.222 --> 40:59.598
Is he aggressive?

40:59.640 --> 41:00.683
Can I pat him?

41:01.225 --> 41:02.810
Aw, so cute.

41:03.185 --> 41:04.812
Let me take a picture.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.439
Hurry, before he wriggles.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.238
Let's go.

41:14.279 --> 41:15.823
What you gonna do with him?

41:15.864 --> 41:16.699
Come.

41:31.797 --> 41:33.882
Let's check with the kids from B5,

41:34.133 --> 41:35.592
maybe they got intel.

41:37.594 --> 41:39.096
SCU style, Greaser.

41:42.933 --> 41:43.976
Slow down.

41:46.603 --> 41:47.438
Here they are.

41:54.486 --> 41:55.863
Watch out! Cops!

41:55.904 --> 41:57.489
Stop! Where you going?

41:58.782 --> 42:00.326
Don't move!

42:00.367 --> 42:01.535
Where you going?

42:02.786 --> 42:03.787
Why you running?

42:03.829 --> 42:05.873
Gents, hands out your pockets.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.584
Are my hands in my pockets?

42:08.626 --> 42:09.752
I'm talking to you.

42:10.586 --> 42:11.879
Come on, hurry up!

42:14.632 --> 42:16.425
Blondie, stay there.

42:16.467 --> 42:17.551
Why you running?

42:17.593 --> 42:18.594
Don't move.

42:18.636 --> 42:20.346
Greaser, watch him.

42:21.263 --> 42:22.890
Hello, police check.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.517
I'm going to frisk you now.

42:25.559 --> 42:27.144
Any sharp items on you?

42:28.187 --> 42:29.688
Any illicit items?

42:29.980 --> 42:31.398
- I'm talking to you!
- No.

42:31.440 --> 42:32.858
Glad to hear you.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.984
Are we done?

42:34.318 --> 42:37.237
Was I disrespectful to you? No.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.574
Lots of lighters.

42:43.619 --> 42:44.953
This yours?

42:44.995 --> 42:45.788
Yeah.

42:45.829 --> 42:47.164
You pay for the bus?

42:50.584 --> 42:53.295
I'm not done frisking, stand still!

42:54.088 --> 42:55.506
Where's the lion?

42:55.547 --> 42:57.049
What lion?

42:57.091 --> 42:59.093
We need it back. Where is it?

42:59.134 --> 43:00.094
No lion.

43:00.135 --> 43:01.303
Go fuck yourself!

43:01.762 --> 43:03.389
Down a notch.

43:04.264 --> 43:06.892
- What did you say?
- Fuck yourself!

43:07.393 --> 43:10.354
You're only fifteen so shut the fuck up!

43:12.064 --> 43:13.148
What's happening?

43:13.649 --> 43:15.734
What's wrong with you?

43:15.776 --> 43:18.320
Get back in here! I already told you!

43:18.362 --> 43:20.531
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

43:20.572 --> 43:23.117
- Harassing us every day?
- Sorry.

43:23.158 --> 43:25.411
Enough, down a notch!

43:25.452 --> 43:26.578
This is my home!

43:26.620 --> 43:27.871
Let's go.

43:27.913 --> 43:29.957
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Not accepted.

43:29.999 --> 43:31.458
You out of your mind?

43:32.668 --> 43:35.045
You harass our kids and apologize?

43:35.087 --> 43:36.839
He shouldn't run when he sees us.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.590
Why hit him?

43:39.300 --> 43:40.342
Why?

43:43.595 --> 43:44.513
Congrats.

43:44.555 --> 43:46.682
You get told off and apologize.

43:47.349 --> 43:49.018
You in customer service?

43:49.059 --> 43:50.394
Can't we be polite?

43:50.436 --> 43:53.230
Then work as a butler in a palace.

43:53.689 --> 43:55.524
Any luster or gildings here?

43:55.816 --> 43:57.443
Never sorry, always right.

43:57.484 --> 44:00.571
Take that dumb armband off.
It's obvious we're cops.

44:18.005 --> 44:18.964
Got him!

44:21.550 --> 44:22.676
From this morning.

44:23.677 --> 44:25.012
Little Issa.

44:25.846 --> 44:27.348
Bingo. Let's go!

44:56.543 --> 44:57.836
Police!

44:59.213 --> 45:00.464
Open up, ma'am.

45:02.967 --> 45:03.926
What do you want?

45:03.968 --> 45:05.511
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, sir.

45:05.552 --> 45:06.971
- Looking for Issa.
- Not here.

45:07.554 --> 45:09.390
- Where is he?
- Out and about.

45:09.431 --> 45:11.225
- Where?
- I don't know.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.185
Don't you monitor him?

45:13.227 --> 45:15.437
Sir, Issa is not here.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.272
Stop!

45:17.314 --> 45:18.857
Let me look inside.

45:18.899 --> 45:21.068
Stop or I'll call the real police.

45:21.110 --> 45:23.320
I am the real police, ma'am.

45:23.362 --> 45:25.114
You need a search warrant.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.448
I don't need one.

45:26.490 --> 45:28.575
I know my rights. You do.

45:28.617 --> 45:30.619
Where's your husband?

45:30.661 --> 45:31.578
He's not here.

45:31.620 --> 45:34.039
He was at the precinct this morning.

45:34.081 --> 45:35.457
No warrant, no access.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.293
I got this... Ma'am.

45:37.584 --> 45:39.586
Last time Issa misbehaved,

45:39.628 --> 45:42.798
the judge issued a warrant, remember?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.259
We searched your home
for two hours.

45:45.759 --> 45:47.553
Want to do that again?

45:47.594 --> 45:48.429
We agree?

45:48.554 --> 45:52.308
Let us in.
If Issa's not here, we leave.

45:55.978 --> 45:58.564
I don't understand.
Speak French, ma'am.

45:58.605 --> 46:01.650
What is she saying?
I don't understand.

46:03.694 --> 46:04.987
Okay. I'll be back.

46:11.618 --> 46:12.870
Damn.

46:12.911 --> 46:15.873
No clue where her kid is.
She won't let us in.

46:16.248 --> 46:18.417
She's right.
We don't have a warrant.

46:19.168 --> 46:21.003
You'll never be SCU at heart.

46:21.712 --> 46:24.173
Because I don't act like a cowboy?

46:25.215 --> 46:27.426
You don't get it. It's not an act.

46:31.972 --> 46:33.724
- Hello kids.
- Hello.

46:34.183 --> 46:35.267
Where's Issa?

46:35.309 --> 46:36.602
Dunno.

46:36.644 --> 46:38.062
- Really?
- Yes.

46:39.605 --> 46:41.065
Hi real cop.

46:41.106 --> 46:43.776
That's my other son Issaka, not Issa.

46:43.817 --> 46:46.111
Okay. Can I check?

46:46.153 --> 46:47.363
Yes, you can.

47:01.043 --> 47:02.836
We all take turns.

47:04.296 --> 47:05.422
It's our tontine.

47:08.133 --> 47:09.885
- Apologies.
- You're welcome.

47:11.053 --> 47:13.180
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, bye.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.183
Ma'am, don't let your son stray...

47:16.225 --> 47:17.935
Or he'll sail away.

47:17.977 --> 47:19.061
Can't come in.

47:20.062 --> 47:21.480
What were they doing?

47:22.147 --> 47:25.234
A tontine,
a way to borrow without interest.

47:25.275 --> 47:27.653
Everyone pools money,

47:27.695 --> 47:30.614
and one person takes it
for a major expense,

47:30.656 --> 47:32.574
like paying for a wedding

47:33.117 --> 47:35.661
or a trip back home to see family.

47:37.204 --> 47:38.706
Let's check the soccer field.

47:45.129 --> 47:46.046
Issa!

47:49.800 --> 47:50.801
He's there.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.886
Green pants, grey shirt.

47:54.013 --> 47:55.431
Let's cuff him and jet.

48:13.365 --> 48:14.491
Come here!

48:18.037 --> 48:19.163
We did nothing.

48:28.005 --> 48:29.173
Get back!

48:33.218 --> 48:34.678
Rascals!

48:35.179 --> 48:36.555
Get out of here!

48:37.973 --> 48:38.766
Let go!

48:38.807 --> 48:39.975
Give me your hand.

48:40.517 --> 48:41.435
Scram!

48:41.477 --> 48:43.062
Beat it, rascals.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.652
Run, run!

48:51.236 --> 48:52.529
Get away, Issa.

48:54.615 --> 48:55.908
Get back here!

49:02.498 --> 49:04.208
Go home, fool.

49:05.584 --> 49:06.961
Stop right there!

49:20.849 --> 49:22.059
Fuck!

49:48.919 --> 49:49.962
Stop!

49:50.754 --> 49:51.922
Don't move!

49:52.256 --> 49:54.174
On the ground. Hands up!

49:54.216 --> 49:56.593
Making me run? Lil' fag!

49:56.635 --> 49:57.594
Fuck!

49:59.179 --> 50:00.389
Where's the lion?

50:00.431 --> 50:01.724
In the basement.

50:01.765 --> 50:02.850
Which one?

50:02.891 --> 50:03.892
It ran away.

50:03.934 --> 50:06.270
Shitbird! Don't mess with me.

50:06.312 --> 50:08.314
- Where is it?
- It ran away.

50:08.355 --> 50:09.857
Where did it go?

50:09.898 --> 50:11.317
Where is it?

50:11.358 --> 50:12.359
Let me go.

50:13.068 --> 50:15.446
Get up! Shitbird!

50:15.487 --> 50:16.739
Back up!

50:16.780 --> 50:18.407
Greaser!
Take care of him.

50:18.949 --> 50:20.617
Come here.

50:22.411 --> 50:23.287
Scram.

50:30.794 --> 50:32.713
Let him go! He did nothing!

50:34.673 --> 50:35.924
Beat it, faggot!

50:37.468 --> 50:38.552
Get outta here!

50:38.927 --> 50:39.720
Move!

50:39.762 --> 50:41.013
Get away!

50:43.474 --> 50:44.433
Scram!

50:46.560 --> 50:47.561
Let him go!

50:48.437 --> 50:50.397
Move or I'll shoot!

51:32.523 --> 51:33.357
Don't move!

51:50.124 --> 51:50.958
Give it!

51:53.585 --> 51:54.420
Fuck...

52:14.440 --> 52:15.357
Fuck!

52:15.399 --> 52:16.692
It's filming us!

52:28.954 --> 52:30.164
Fuck!

52:34.376 --> 52:36.462
What do we do? Fuck!

52:37.212 --> 52:38.464
He's still breathing.

52:39.798 --> 52:40.799
What you doing?

52:40.841 --> 52:41.675
Calling help.

52:42.051 --> 52:45.012
You stupid?
And tell'm what? We shot a kid?

52:48.849 --> 52:50.351
He needs to go to the ER.

52:50.392 --> 52:52.686
Him later. First, the drone.

52:53.145 --> 52:56.315
The drone?
The kid's unconscious!

52:56.357 --> 52:58.359
Gwada, me,

52:58.400 --> 52:59.985
you, the team.

53:00.653 --> 53:01.862
That's the priority.

53:01.904 --> 53:03.989
If the video gets out, we're done!

53:04.031 --> 53:06.325
Now do what I say. Let's go!

53:10.621 --> 53:12.081
Get in the car!

53:39.650 --> 53:40.693
Fuck...

53:52.663 --> 53:54.456
We're really messing up here.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.254
I'm talking to you, fool!

54:10.848 --> 54:12.433
The cops screwed up.

54:12.891 --> 54:15.352
Pink Pig and his unit.

54:15.394 --> 54:16.812
What now?

54:16.854 --> 54:18.689
We were playing soccer

54:18.731 --> 54:20.649
and they grabbed Issa.

54:20.899 --> 54:23.694
I don't care if they got Issa.

54:23.736 --> 54:25.654
He always fucking up.

54:25.696 --> 54:26.989
He did nothing.

54:27.031 --> 54:28.615
Right, always innocent.

54:28.657 --> 54:29.491
Now, scram.

54:30.075 --> 54:31.118
Beat it.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.786
They flash-balled him.

54:32.828 --> 54:33.829
He might be dead.

54:34.079 --> 54:35.039
You serious?

54:35.622 --> 54:37.082
- Who was there?
- Us.

54:37.124 --> 54:38.876
A drone filmed it all.

54:40.044 --> 54:42.087
- A drone?
- Yup. Filmed it all.

54:42.379 --> 54:43.589
You sure about that?

54:44.173 --> 54:45.716
You know who was filming?

54:46.967 --> 54:48.344
Is that the truth?

54:49.345 --> 54:50.763
Step into the office.

54:52.806 --> 54:54.016
You hungry?

54:54.058 --> 54:54.892
Yup.

55:05.402 --> 55:06.570
Greaser.

55:06.612 --> 55:08.989
Watch him. We'll be back in five.

55:21.543 --> 55:22.836
Is Stingy in?

55:31.178 --> 55:32.137
Where is he?

55:33.055 --> 55:35.265
In the back. I'll go get him.

55:47.569 --> 55:49.071
Chris is here.

55:49.113 --> 55:50.739
With his partners.

56:01.709 --> 56:04.169
Bruh, what's with the screw face?

56:04.211 --> 56:05.546
What's up?

56:06.463 --> 56:07.631
Got a situation.

56:07.673 --> 56:08.799
What happened?

56:09.758 --> 56:11.385
What situation?

56:13.012 --> 56:15.097
- Can we talk here?
- Shoot.

56:15.973 --> 56:17.725
Our last patrol turned sour.

56:18.475 --> 56:19.852
Kids kept pushing us.

56:19.893 --> 56:22.354
A kid got flash-balled in the face.

56:22.396 --> 56:24.148
Bro, that's bad news.

56:24.189 --> 56:25.899
Y'all fucked up, which kid?

56:25.941 --> 56:26.942
Little Issa.

56:26.984 --> 56:28.277
Is he okay?

56:28.527 --> 56:30.988
He's a bit asleep. He'll be okay.

56:31.905 --> 56:34.867
That's not the issue.
A drone filmed us.

56:35.326 --> 56:37.119
You know who has one?

56:37.161 --> 56:39.121
I have no idea.

56:39.163 --> 56:41.874
I need that video or I'm in deep shit.

56:42.458 --> 56:43.584
Make some calls.

56:43.917 --> 56:45.878
- Gotta find him.
- On it.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.171
Go for it.

57:28.253 --> 57:29.463
So?

57:30.381 --> 57:31.465
He's not there.

57:33.550 --> 57:35.386
Where does Buzz hang out?

57:35.970 --> 57:37.972
No idea.
Either the pit...

57:38.013 --> 57:39.515
or the soccer field.

57:39.556 --> 57:40.808
Gotta go check.

57:41.266 --> 57:43.727
Tell our guys to spot the SCU's car.

57:44.103 --> 57:45.646
It's a grey Peugeot.

57:45.688 --> 57:47.147
Trail them.

58:18.178 --> 58:19.722
Gotta straighten you up.

58:20.180 --> 58:21.307
Sorry.

58:21.348 --> 58:22.850
Hold on. Upright.

58:25.519 --> 58:26.812
Little forward.

58:26.854 --> 58:29.523
Sorry, I can't uncuff you.
Need the keys.

58:31.066 --> 58:32.192
It's gonna be okay.

58:33.068 --> 58:34.111
Can you hear me?

58:38.449 --> 58:39.533
Stay still.

58:42.953 --> 58:44.288
Just relax.

58:44.330 --> 58:45.456
You'll be okay.

58:49.126 --> 58:50.127
I know...

58:57.009 --> 58:58.177
Fuck.

59:12.524 --> 59:13.651
Where were you?

59:16.945 --> 59:18.197
At the pharmacy.

59:19.114 --> 59:20.658
How is he? He wake up?

59:20.699 --> 59:23.035
Yeah. Still faint. Uncuff him.

59:23.077 --> 59:24.703
Got a tip on the drone.

59:25.371 --> 59:26.538
Uncuff him.

59:36.006 --> 59:37.341
What you doing?

59:37.383 --> 59:38.759
- He stays here.
- What?

59:38.801 --> 59:39.969
He stays here.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.011
With them?

59:41.720 --> 59:42.721
Let's go.

59:44.974 --> 59:46.475
He must go to the ER.

59:46.517 --> 59:48.519
Not gonna lug him around.
Hop in.

59:49.019 --> 59:50.854
He's safe here.

1:00:04.284 --> 1:00:05.327
Don't move!

1:00:05.953 --> 1:00:06.787
Stay there!

1:00:07.162 --> 1:00:08.247
Don't move!

1:00:08.914 --> 1:00:09.999
Open the door!

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:13.419
Grab the drone. Meet downstairs.

1:00:37.609 --> 1:00:39.320
The memory card's gone.

1:00:41.822 --> 1:00:43.198
He's got the card.

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.992
Hear me? Don't lose him.

1:01:12.061 --> 1:01:13.854
I lost the shitbird.

1:01:14.938 --> 1:01:16.065
Meet at the shops.

1:01:19.652 --> 1:01:21.987
He didn't just vanish...

1:01:24.281 --> 1:01:26.075
He must've cut through B11.

1:01:35.376 --> 1:01:37.628
Is the kid safe with those guys?

1:01:38.087 --> 1:01:39.254
Don't worry.

1:02:02.903 --> 1:02:04.154
Is Salah here?

1:02:04.530 --> 1:02:05.948
Salah?

1:02:05.990 --> 1:02:07.366
A kid wants to see you.

1:02:09.201 --> 1:02:10.411
I'm in trouble.

1:02:10.452 --> 1:02:12.496
Cops looking for me. Help me.

1:02:12.538 --> 1:02:13.622
What happened?

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:17.501
Take a deep breath.

1:02:17.918 --> 1:02:19.336
Come, sit down.

1:02:21.922 --> 1:02:23.215
Calm down.

1:02:29.430 --> 1:02:30.306
Hello?

1:02:33.684 --> 1:02:34.518
What?

1:02:36.937 --> 1:02:37.855
Right.

1:02:37.896 --> 1:02:39.189
What's up?

1:02:39.231 --> 1:02:40.983
They find the kid? It's good?

1:02:41.567 --> 1:02:42.985
He went to Salah's.

1:02:44.987 --> 1:02:46.488
Not him. Goddamn!

1:02:46.530 --> 1:02:47.865
Let's go.

1:02:49.199 --> 1:02:50.367
Fucking hell.

1:02:50.409 --> 1:02:51.994
Him of all people.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.418
He can't be far.

1:03:03.047 --> 1:03:04.089
Why are they here?

1:03:08.510 --> 1:03:10.304
The kid's there. Let's go!

1:03:10.346 --> 1:03:11.847
- Let's go!
- Wait.

1:03:11.889 --> 1:03:14.183
For what? He's there.

1:03:14.224 --> 1:03:16.685
Calling Stingy. How else will we get it?

1:03:19.647 --> 1:03:21.774
This is gonna cost us a lot.

1:03:30.324 --> 1:03:31.450
Buzz.

1:03:31.492 --> 1:03:32.868
Alright bro?

1:03:36.288 --> 1:03:38.499
You got something I want.

1:03:41.293 --> 1:03:44.004
We could ruin the SCU with that video.

1:03:48.133 --> 1:03:49.385
Don't worry.

1:04:08.696 --> 1:04:11.490
If we're clever, we can blackmail them.

1:04:12.574 --> 1:04:16.120
And get whatever we want
from these assholes.

1:04:19.415 --> 1:04:21.375
Dark thoughts as always.

1:04:26.005 --> 1:04:27.298
Watch it, Salah.

1:04:28.799 --> 1:04:30.175
Don't try to play me.

1:04:31.385 --> 1:04:33.554
I could really ruin your life.

1:04:37.349 --> 1:04:39.560
A dog barks when he can't bite.

1:04:39.601 --> 1:04:41.228
Phony wiseman.

1:04:41.270 --> 1:04:43.063
Just give us the video.

1:04:43.772 --> 1:04:44.648
Salah,

1:04:45.399 --> 1:04:47.192
we're here to make things right.

1:04:47.234 --> 1:04:49.987
I don't want that to happen
to my little brother.

1:04:50.863 --> 1:04:52.573
They all know us here.

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:58.329
We're good people.
Right, Buzz? Tell him.

1:05:12.801 --> 1:05:14.303
- You good?
- You?

1:05:14.345 --> 1:05:15.679
Let's cut to the chase.

1:05:16.013 --> 1:05:17.222
What do you want?

1:05:17.848 --> 1:05:19.808
What do you need? A hookup?

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:23.812
This doesn't even concern you.

1:05:24.396 --> 1:05:27.232
Give the video to Chris,
and we're all happy.

1:05:27.274 --> 1:05:28.776
That's why you're here?

1:05:29.068 --> 1:05:30.527
Business as usual?

1:05:30.569 --> 1:05:31.403
What you think?

1:05:31.987 --> 1:05:33.864
You brainwash these kids.

1:05:34.281 --> 1:05:37.034
It'll start a riot.
Bad for business.

1:05:37.076 --> 1:05:38.118
What do you want?

1:05:38.702 --> 1:05:40.162
Go sell your poison.

1:05:40.204 --> 1:05:42.206
That's what you call it now?

1:05:42.748 --> 1:05:46.085
Pretend to be an Imam.
I know your true colors.

1:05:46.377 --> 1:05:48.671
Robin Hood, my ass.

1:05:49.129 --> 1:05:51.465
Brothers not here to eat,

1:05:52.341 --> 1:05:54.051
I suggest you leave.

1:05:59.264 --> 1:06:00.265
Lost cause.

1:06:06.563 --> 1:06:07.982
Who d'you think you are?

1:06:09.525 --> 1:06:10.943
The new sheriff in town?

1:06:12.277 --> 1:06:14.822
One call and you're a terror suspect.

1:06:15.322 --> 1:06:17.032
This shit eatery folds.

1:06:18.492 --> 1:06:20.661
Your dead-end mosque for retards.

1:06:21.161 --> 1:06:21.996
Finished.

1:06:22.997 --> 1:06:24.540
I'll arrest you tomorrow,

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:28.002
in front of your wife and kid. Get it?

1:06:32.256 --> 1:06:33.090
Come with me.

1:06:36.260 --> 1:06:37.469
Let him go!

1:06:37.511 --> 1:06:38.679
Your hands!

1:06:41.473 --> 1:06:42.558
Stop!

1:06:43.892 --> 1:06:45.811
Hands behind your back!

1:06:45.853 --> 1:06:46.687
Chris!

1:06:47.062 --> 1:06:48.105
Let go!

1:06:48.814 --> 1:06:50.816
- Taking it too far!
- Breaking my balls?

1:06:55.821 --> 1:06:56.864
What?

1:06:58.198 --> 1:06:59.658
I am the Law!

1:07:01.535 --> 1:07:02.411
What?

1:07:03.078 --> 1:07:04.079
What you gonna do?

1:07:04.747 --> 1:07:07.207
Can we talk, Salah?

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:12.630
Come with me.

1:07:31.815 --> 1:07:33.942
The kid that stole the lion,

1:07:34.568 --> 1:07:37.863
we tried to stop him
but his friends cornered us.

1:07:38.364 --> 1:07:39.865
It happened so fast.

1:07:40.532 --> 1:07:44.119
No harm was intended.
The flash-ball fired involuntarily.

1:07:44.495 --> 1:07:46.914
I swear, believe me.

1:07:46.955 --> 1:07:48.207
Involuntarily?

1:07:49.083 --> 1:07:50.668
What are you saying?

1:07:52.461 --> 1:07:53.420
It was an accident?

1:07:55.214 --> 1:07:56.423
Not your fault?

1:07:57.299 --> 1:07:58.509
As usual.

1:07:58.968 --> 1:08:01.261
You don't know
how to use your weapons?

1:08:01.929 --> 1:08:03.263
Bad luck?

1:08:03.681 --> 1:08:05.265
That's not what I'm saying.

1:08:05.724 --> 1:08:08.435
If the video gets out,
this place will burn.

1:08:08.936 --> 1:08:13.482
What if voicing anger
was the only way to be heard?

1:08:15.192 --> 1:08:17.527
Who did their anger serve in 2005?

1:08:18.070 --> 1:08:19.238
No one.

1:08:19.278 --> 1:08:20.780
They burned cars,

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:23.408
destroyed bus shelters. What's left?

1:08:24.368 --> 1:08:25.327
A bare pole?

1:08:25.744 --> 1:08:27.955
Not a bench to sit on. Nothing.

1:08:28.330 --> 1:08:29.832
It backfired.

1:08:30.915 --> 1:08:33.085
Worst thing is that no one cares.

1:09:04.533 --> 1:09:05.868
Let me handle it.

1:09:08.287 --> 1:09:09.371
How's the kid?

1:09:10.622 --> 1:09:12.331
He'll pull through.

1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.084
- Sure?
- He'll be okay.

1:09:22.592 --> 1:09:24.344
I want to trust you.

1:09:27.389 --> 1:09:29.683
But you won't avoid their rage.

1:10:35.749 --> 1:10:38.419
<i>Attention units. This is not a joke.</i>

1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:41.255
<i>A lion cub has been spotted
at the community garden.</i>

1:10:41.839 --> 1:10:44.300
SCU responding, close by. On our way.

1:11:07.156 --> 1:11:08.407
Pharaoh. Let's go.

1:11:10.326 --> 1:11:11.618
Well done, kiddo.

1:11:15.289 --> 1:11:16.123
Zorro.

1:11:16.874 --> 1:11:18.292
Look who's here.

1:11:18.334 --> 1:11:20.044
Gave you my word.

1:11:20.085 --> 1:11:21.712
He brought my little man.

1:11:23.505 --> 1:11:24.632
My Johnny.

1:11:25.257 --> 1:11:26.258
My Johnny.

1:11:27.092 --> 1:11:28.177
Is that Daddy?

1:11:28.218 --> 1:11:29.678
Come here, my boy.

1:11:30.888 --> 1:11:32.264
There...

1:11:32.890 --> 1:11:33.849
Careful.

1:11:36.435 --> 1:11:37.561
Attaboy!

1:11:37.811 --> 1:11:38.646
Happy?

1:11:39.188 --> 1:11:40.814
Happy to be home?

1:11:47.946 --> 1:11:50.491
I brought you the thief to apologize.

1:11:50.532 --> 1:11:51.367
Say sorry.

1:11:51.742 --> 1:11:52.910
Sorry.

1:11:52.951 --> 1:11:55.829
What happened buddy? You fall?

1:11:55.871 --> 1:11:57.373
He slipped.

1:11:57.414 --> 1:11:59.083
What a slide!

1:11:59.124 --> 1:12:01.001
Come here, let's talk.

1:12:01.794 --> 1:12:05.047
You can't do that.
We come here to perform.

1:12:05.089 --> 1:12:07.925
We bring the circus. Animals.

1:12:07.967 --> 1:12:10.970
You steal from us. Can't do that.

1:12:11.011 --> 1:12:13.180
I don't steal in your hood.

1:12:13.222 --> 1:12:14.848
Here, go in there.

1:12:19.061 --> 1:12:20.479
Zorro! What you doing?

1:12:20.521 --> 1:12:21.814
Stop playing!

1:12:25.567 --> 1:12:26.944
He's not happy.

1:12:26.986 --> 1:12:28.362
Enough with the jokes!

1:12:29.446 --> 1:12:30.322
Let him out!

1:12:31.657 --> 1:12:32.616
Let him out!

1:12:32.658 --> 1:12:33.575
Let the kid out!

1:12:35.327 --> 1:12:36.954
Let the kid out or else...

1:12:43.085 --> 1:12:44.712
'The fuck away from me.

1:12:48.799 --> 1:12:50.134
He pissed himself.

1:12:51.802 --> 1:12:54.013
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

1:12:54.054 --> 1:12:55.180
Don't believe you!

1:12:57.683 --> 1:12:59.143
Let the kid out.

1:12:59.184 --> 1:13:00.269
Let him out!

1:13:00.311 --> 1:13:01.395
It's a joke...

1:13:01.437 --> 1:13:04.064
A joke? Let him out!

1:13:04.106 --> 1:13:06.692
It's okay. Don't be scared.

1:13:06.734 --> 1:13:08.027
It's a joke.

1:13:08.652 --> 1:13:09.820
Put the piece away.

1:13:10.529 --> 1:13:12.156
Just a joke.

1:13:12.906 --> 1:13:14.116
Sure it is.

1:13:15.492 --> 1:13:17.870
- You a real schmuck.
- No, you are.

1:13:17.911 --> 1:13:20.205
All good. Go home now.

1:13:22.791 --> 1:13:24.376
Go fuck yourself!

1:13:58.160 --> 1:13:59.578
Come here little man.

1:14:05.084 --> 1:14:06.085
You okay?

1:14:07.002 --> 1:14:08.545
Doesn't hurt anymore?

1:14:09.505 --> 1:14:10.422
Let's see.

1:14:11.173 --> 1:14:12.508
Just a bit red.

1:14:14.009 --> 1:14:15.302
You'll be fine.

1:14:21.266 --> 1:14:22.476
Listen up.

1:14:25.479 --> 1:14:26.855
How did this happen?

1:14:30.401 --> 1:14:33.362
If anyone asks, what will you say?

1:14:34.989 --> 1:14:36.448
What's the answer?

1:14:37.908 --> 1:14:39.576
You fell on the ground.

1:14:40.452 --> 1:14:41.286
Know why?

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:47.334
Because Issa won't stop
messing up. Right?

1:14:47.876 --> 1:14:49.753
So bad things happen.

1:14:52.506 --> 1:14:54.425
It's your fault, understood?

1:14:55.050 --> 1:14:57.177
You did this to yourself. Look at me.

1:14:57.511 --> 1:14:58.929
You did this to yourself.

1:15:00.723 --> 1:15:02.266
Say it.

1:15:03.726 --> 1:15:04.977
What happened?

1:15:07.187 --> 1:15:08.480
I can't hear you.

1:15:08.522 --> 1:15:10.107
I fell over.

1:15:10.733 --> 1:15:12.609
Good. Who's fault?

1:15:13.068 --> 1:15:14.778
My fault.

1:15:15.112 --> 1:15:15.946
Good.

1:15:16.613 --> 1:15:19.241
That's enough.
He gets it. Let him go.

1:15:20.743 --> 1:15:21.869
Beat it. Go home.

1:15:22.745 --> 1:15:23.996
He gets it.

1:15:25.289 --> 1:15:26.373
'Fuck out of here.

1:15:33.964 --> 1:15:36.342
- What's your problem?
- Leave him alone.

1:15:36.717 --> 1:15:38.093
I don't like your tone.

1:15:38.135 --> 1:15:39.094
Really?

1:15:40.554 --> 1:15:41.889
He gave you the video?

1:15:43.057 --> 1:15:44.016
Yes or no?

1:15:44.058 --> 1:15:45.476
- I got it.
- Hand it over.

1:15:46.435 --> 1:15:47.770
No, fuck you.

1:15:47.811 --> 1:15:49.772
- Hands off!
- What did you say?

1:15:49.813 --> 1:15:51.398
Easy. Easy.

1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:53.400
The video stays in my pocket.

1:15:53.442 --> 1:15:55.819
No one will see it, but I'm keeping it.

1:15:57.112 --> 1:15:58.489
I'm okay with that.

1:15:58.530 --> 1:15:59.782
Okay with what?

1:15:59.823 --> 1:16:01.283
How is this okay?

1:16:02.034 --> 1:16:03.911
You're under my command!

1:16:03.952 --> 1:16:05.954
Not anymore. That's over.

1:16:05.996 --> 1:16:07.790
- Come again, fuckface.
- Back off!

1:16:09.667 --> 1:16:11.001
Some attitude.

1:16:11.293 --> 1:16:13.712
I read your file. You're a cocksucker.

1:16:15.589 --> 1:16:18.634
I'm head of this unit
cuz no one rides me.

1:16:18.676 --> 1:16:19.927
Back off!

1:16:19.969 --> 1:16:20.970
Chris!

1:16:21.887 --> 1:16:23.097
What's going on?

1:16:23.138 --> 1:16:25.683
Look at his face. He's a fucking rat.

1:16:26.517 --> 1:16:29.395
Eager to report us to internal affairs.

1:16:31.897 --> 1:16:32.940
Know what?

1:16:33.565 --> 1:16:35.234
I didn't shoot a kid.

1:16:35.275 --> 1:16:36.485
Shut up.

1:16:38.696 --> 1:16:39.613
I'll handle it.

1:16:40.698 --> 1:16:44.076
Even if you get the video,
it won't stop him from talking.

1:16:46.662 --> 1:16:47.871
I'm warning you.

1:16:48.497 --> 1:16:51.542
You leak it,
the entire force will be against you.

1:16:52.501 --> 1:16:53.794
Think about it.

1:18:32.101 --> 1:18:33.143
You okay?

1:18:34.269 --> 1:18:35.396
I'm okay.

1:18:36.188 --> 1:18:37.773
I'm good. Already ate.

1:18:38.649 --> 1:18:40.067
Already had a bite.

1:18:40.651 --> 1:18:43.737
Not hungry. I'm tired, Mom.
Gonna go to bed.

1:18:44.196 --> 1:18:45.614
That's good.

1:18:48.409 --> 1:18:50.911
Dad, she won't let me play.

1:18:50.953 --> 1:18:52.496
Bonnie, let her play.

1:18:53.455 --> 1:18:54.790
Give me a go.

1:18:54.832 --> 1:18:56.667
I'll just finish this game.

1:18:57.001 --> 1:18:58.544
Put them to bed, please.

1:18:59.378 --> 1:19:01.213
Girls. Go to bed.

1:19:01.255 --> 1:19:02.631
Give it to me.

1:19:03.966 --> 1:19:05.801
Go to bed now.

1:19:05.843 --> 1:19:07.553
I'll hurt your barbie.

1:19:07.594 --> 1:19:08.887
Bonnie, stop that!

1:19:09.388 --> 1:19:10.723
Right now!

1:19:10.764 --> 1:19:12.099
I was playing.

1:19:12.725 --> 1:19:13.851
Go to bed, now.

1:19:14.685 --> 1:19:15.602
Lylan.

1:19:16.729 --> 1:19:17.604
Go to bed.

1:19:21.734 --> 1:19:23.152
Quit stomping.

1:19:23.193 --> 1:19:24.278
Whatever.

1:19:44.048 --> 1:19:45.257
I'm okay.

1:20:58.497 --> 1:21:00.082
My boy, how are you?

1:21:02.001 --> 1:21:03.335
How was school?

1:21:05.004 --> 1:21:06.171
What did you do?

1:22:09.985 --> 1:22:11.195
Want a drink?

1:22:17.076 --> 1:22:19.203
Sparkling water, please.

1:22:28.921 --> 1:22:29.838
You okay?

1:22:31.090 --> 1:22:32.257
You?

1:22:32.299 --> 1:22:33.300
I'm okay.

1:22:38.305 --> 1:22:39.348
Thanks.

1:22:44.228 --> 1:22:45.938
Were you able to unwind?

1:22:49.066 --> 1:22:50.067
And you?

1:22:52.194 --> 1:22:53.070
Yeah.

1:22:57.574 --> 1:23:00.244
Called my son.
Did a few things.

1:23:02.371 --> 1:23:03.664
He's okay?

1:23:04.623 --> 1:23:05.582
Yeah.

1:23:07.459 --> 1:23:09.169
You don't have kids, do you?

1:23:11.588 --> 1:23:12.756
Not yet.

1:23:14.008 --> 1:23:15.467
It's a good feeling.

1:23:20.180 --> 1:23:21.223
So.

1:23:27.104 --> 1:23:29.064
I know how a flash-ball trigger works.

1:23:29.857 --> 1:23:31.817
You can't fire by accident.

1:23:35.612 --> 1:23:37.614
That's not what I told Salah but...

1:23:38.532 --> 1:23:40.200
What happened?

1:23:46.707 --> 1:23:49.001
I dunno why. I fucked up.

1:23:51.587 --> 1:23:54.089
I saw it coming.
I've been stressed out...

1:23:56.050 --> 1:23:58.927
With all those kids screaming...

1:24:03.349 --> 1:24:04.850
I just lost it.

1:24:08.646 --> 1:24:11.357
I lost my temper. Just lost it.

1:24:15.152 --> 1:24:17.446
It was their fault? You serious?

1:24:18.822 --> 1:24:20.741
We were ambushed by kids.

1:24:21.158 --> 1:24:22.701
You shot at close range.

1:24:22.743 --> 1:24:24.620
He was handcuffed.
Could've died.

1:24:24.870 --> 1:24:26.580
I'm sorry for little Issa.

1:24:27.039 --> 1:24:28.082
Really?

1:24:29.667 --> 1:24:30.918
Sorry for what?

1:24:33.170 --> 1:24:34.755
You told him you were sorry?

1:24:35.881 --> 1:24:38.842
Like Chris says, never say sorry.

1:24:42.262 --> 1:24:43.555
Listen...

1:24:44.306 --> 1:24:47.643
This was the worst day of my life
teamed up with you

1:24:47.685 --> 1:24:49.019
and that dimwit Chris.

1:24:50.145 --> 1:24:52.648
All you do is screw up.

1:24:56.235 --> 1:24:58.612
You just arrived
and you're lecturing us?

1:25:02.157 --> 1:25:03.993
We have to act this way.

1:25:04.034 --> 1:25:06.203
You saw the night unit?

1:25:06.495 --> 1:25:09.915
All Rambo-ed up.
We're the only ones respected.

1:25:13.419 --> 1:25:14.753
Respect?

1:25:15.462 --> 1:25:17.298
People around here just fear you.

1:25:17.339 --> 1:25:18.757
I grew up here.

1:25:20.509 --> 1:25:23.095
We've been working
these streets 10 years.

1:25:24.972 --> 1:25:26.515
This is our life.

1:25:47.870 --> 1:25:48.954
Know what?

1:25:55.961 --> 1:25:56.795
Keep it.

1:25:59.089 --> 1:26:00.466
Do what you gotta do.

1:26:38.170 --> 1:26:39.672
Let's get Haroona.

1:26:40.923 --> 1:26:42.800
Get Boodlal.

1:26:44.468 --> 1:26:45.594
Get Yussuf.

1:27:03.070 --> 1:27:04.029
Cops!

1:27:06.031 --> 1:27:06.991
Hide!

1:27:23.757 --> 1:27:24.842
Yo, bugs.

1:27:24.883 --> 1:27:26.051
It's Pink Pig.

1:27:26.093 --> 1:27:26.927
Come here.

1:27:27.594 --> 1:27:28.679
What's going on?

1:27:28.721 --> 1:27:30.222
Just hanging.

1:27:30.681 --> 1:27:32.349
No Club Med today?

1:27:35.019 --> 1:27:36.437
Do the Pink Pig.

1:27:38.105 --> 1:27:39.064
Go play.

1:27:52.911 --> 1:27:53.954
Beat it!

1:28:00.252 --> 1:28:01.587
Drive off!

1:28:29.948 --> 1:28:30.783
There!

1:28:47.299 --> 1:28:48.842
Out of my way!

1:28:52.721 --> 1:28:54.098
Stop right there!

1:29:02.064 --> 1:29:03.649
Let them have their fun.

1:29:04.525 --> 1:29:05.901
Move!

1:29:06.402 --> 1:29:07.695
Piss off!

1:29:08.529 --> 1:29:09.530
Get out!

1:29:11.365 --> 1:29:13.409
Retard, watch your mom cry.

1:29:59.747 --> 1:30:01.665
There are kids trailing us.

1:30:05.210 --> 1:30:06.337
What are they doing?

1:30:08.297 --> 1:30:10.007
Looking for a spanking?

1:30:40.496 --> 1:30:41.830
What do they want?

1:30:53.467 --> 1:30:54.802
Son of a bitch!

1:31:04.269 --> 1:31:05.729
Block the elevator!

1:31:06.438 --> 1:31:07.898
We need backup.

1:31:07.940 --> 1:31:09.566
Three gremlins. We got this.

1:31:09.608 --> 1:31:10.776
Out of service.

1:31:11.777 --> 1:31:13.153
Call backup.

1:31:13.821 --> 1:31:17.116
SCU to HQ, we need backup.

1:31:30.296 --> 1:31:31.255
<i>Location?</i>

1:31:31.297 --> 1:31:32.589
Fuck, wait...

1:31:34.633 --> 1:31:37.011
<i>This is HQ, your location?</i>

1:31:40.681 --> 1:31:42.725
<i>What is your location, SCU?</i>

1:31:46.395 --> 1:31:48.814
- 7 Picasso street.
- <i>Say that again.</i>

1:32:44.662 --> 1:32:46.246
Come here, asshole!

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:53.087
Motherfuck you!

1:33:12.815 --> 1:33:13.983
Beat it!

1:33:25.369 --> 1:33:26.370
Motherfuck you!

1:33:45.931 --> 1:33:47.308
Scram, asshole!

1:33:47.933 --> 1:33:49.768
Stay there!

1:33:49.810 --> 1:33:52.062
Let go, asshole!

1:33:52.313 --> 1:33:54.106
Motherfucker, let him go!

1:34:21.425 --> 1:34:22.593
Get back!

1:34:23.594 --> 1:34:24.762
What's going on?

1:34:25.471 --> 1:34:26.889
What's the problem?

1:34:26.930 --> 1:34:28.474
What's going on?

1:34:28.515 --> 1:34:30.809
Move! Get out of my way!

1:34:31.101 --> 1:34:32.102
Beat it!

1:34:33.479 --> 1:34:35.064
Tough guys, now?

1:34:35.481 --> 1:34:36.607
What's wrong?

1:34:38.192 --> 1:34:39.943
Who gave you permission?

1:34:41.570 --> 1:34:42.696
What's wrong?

1:34:43.447 --> 1:34:44.573
You tough?

1:34:49.244 --> 1:34:51.914
What's your fucking problem?

1:34:52.206 --> 1:34:54.375
What are you trying to do?

1:34:55.209 --> 1:34:56.919
Driving me crazy,

1:34:57.878 --> 1:35:00.881
who gave you permission, fuckers?

1:35:00.923 --> 1:35:02.383
Who told you?

1:35:02.841 --> 1:35:05.010
What's wrong with you?

1:35:05.803 --> 1:35:07.221
You tough now?

1:35:07.262 --> 1:35:08.514
Assholes!

1:35:08.555 --> 1:35:09.807
Scram!

1:35:10.432 --> 1:35:11.392
What do you want?

1:35:17.731 --> 1:35:19.900
Motherfuck you, son of a bitch!

1:35:32.746 --> 1:35:33.831
Mortar!

1:35:56.895 --> 1:35:57.730
Fuck!

1:36:01.317 --> 1:36:02.401
Fucking bitches!

1:36:03.527 --> 1:36:05.446
- Chris, you okay?
- My eye!

1:36:13.537 --> 1:36:15.414
Fucking bugs!

1:36:17.958 --> 1:36:19.668
Piss me off!

1:36:57.873 --> 1:36:58.707
Move away!

1:37:08.550 --> 1:37:09.551
Come...

1:37:32.366 --> 1:37:33.909
Motherfuckers!

1:37:48.007 --> 1:37:49.174
Open up! Open!

1:37:50.259 --> 1:37:51.760
Is there someone there?

1:37:51.802 --> 1:37:53.095
Please open up! Help!

1:37:53.971 --> 1:37:55.222
Help!

1:38:00.352 --> 1:38:01.520
Help!

1:38:04.815 --> 1:38:06.442
Please open up!

1:38:06.483 --> 1:38:08.902
I beg you! Please!

1:38:17.369 --> 1:38:18.996
Don't do it, Issa! Please!

1:38:19.038 --> 1:38:20.039
Put it down!

1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:21.999
Listen, Issa! Put it down!

1:38:23.709 --> 1:38:25.252
Listen to me!

1:38:28.005 --> 1:38:29.131
Step back!

1:39:35.030 --> 1:39:38.659
<i>"Remember this, my friends,</i>

1:39:38.701 --> 1:39:43.205
<i>there are no such things
as bad plants or bad men,</i>

1:39:43.247 --> 1:39:48.085
<i>there are only bad cultivators."</i>
