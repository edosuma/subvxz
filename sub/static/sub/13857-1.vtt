00:49.760 --> 00:51.693
Shit.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.200
Sam.

00:58.202 --> 01:00.869
Sam, wake up.

01:00.871 --> 01:02.170
What's wrong?

01:03.974 --> 01:05.907
Fuck.

01:05.909 --> 01:07.743
What'd you do, Tiger?

01:07.745 --> 01:11.113
- When did we crash?
- You tell us, asshole.

01:11.115 --> 01:13.682
I guess I fell asleep.

01:13.684 --> 01:14.716
Yeah...

01:14.718 --> 01:16.585
with the engine running.

01:18.589 --> 01:21.156
Fully charged.

01:21.158 --> 01:22.324
Did you kill the battery too?

01:22.326 --> 01:24.026
You hear the radio?

01:28.832 --> 01:32.601
There's a skating rink
about 11 miles from here.

01:32.603 --> 01:34.102
Big parking lot.

01:34.104 --> 01:36.938
Ice skating
or rollerskating?

01:36.940 --> 01:38.040
Just says they're open.

01:38.042 --> 01:38.974
Why?

01:38.976 --> 01:40.842
Hockey players whoop more ass.

01:40.844 --> 01:43.211
I don't know, dude. I've seen some
pretty bad-ass roller skaters.

01:43.213 --> 01:44.880
At 7:00 AM?

01:44.882 --> 01:47.149
All right,
I'll come with.

03:29.019 --> 03:31.019
- Sam?
- Tad.

03:31.021 --> 03:32.654
Awesome.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.288
Hey, I work nights, but I'll catch
up with you guys for breakfast.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.491
- Okay.
- I'm in 2-R up the stairs.

03:36.493 --> 03:39.161
Just crash wherever.
Uh, park in the side lot.

03:39.163 --> 03:41.129
Rear doors tight to the walls
so no one steals your shit.

03:41.131 --> 03:42.364
All right.

03:42.366 --> 03:44.032
Yeah?

04:01.451 --> 04:03.785
These all have mushrooms.

04:03.787 --> 04:05.187
This dude's legit.

04:06.356 --> 04:08.456
Why? 'Cause he wakes up
at 5:00 in the morning

04:08.458 --> 04:10.058
to put jizz in his hair?

04:10.060 --> 04:11.293
Mm...

04:11.295 --> 04:13.361
No. He's true.

04:18.435 --> 04:19.968
Ree-Ree.

04:22.472 --> 04:24.139
Who you callin'?

04:24.141 --> 04:25.774
Is that your business?

04:25.776 --> 04:27.309
I get the bills.

04:27.311 --> 04:29.110
I'm going to bed.

04:29.112 --> 04:30.846
We're gonna drink.

Mornin'.

04:59.042 --> 05:01.009
Hello.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.931
You were the first
to fall asleep?

05:13.357 --> 05:16.925
Okay, I'm with the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.

05:16.927 --> 05:18.526
Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.

05:18.528 --> 05:22.163
Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.

05:22.165 --> 05:23.398
Not for the zine?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.033
I'll do
a print version for that,

05:25.035 --> 05:26.835
but this will run
on our college station.

05:26.837 --> 05:27.936
Uh, if that's cool.

05:27.938 --> 05:28.904
Yeah.

05:28.906 --> 05:31.539
So, you guys working
on anything new?

05:31.541 --> 05:33.074
Mm, yeah. A few songs.

05:33.076 --> 05:34.943
Maybe enough for,
like, a seven inch.

05:34.945 --> 05:36.544
Sweet. Will you
actually press one?

05:36.546 --> 05:38.013
Yeah, if we can afford it.

05:38.015 --> 05:39.915
Yeah, no, I really dig
the analog style.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.283
Uh, which brings
me to the fact

05:41.285 --> 05:42.951
you guys are hard to find.

05:42.953 --> 05:44.619
Why no social media presence?

05:44.621 --> 05:47.055
That's because
booking more shows,

05:47.057 --> 05:48.957
selling more records
would blow.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.091
It's not hard rock.

05:50.093 --> 05:52.494
No one wants to starve, but...

05:53.864 --> 05:57.465
when you take it all virtual,
you lose...

05:57.467 --> 05:59.301
the texture.

05:59.303 --> 06:02.971
- What do you mean "texture"?
- Just... you gotta be there.

06:02.973 --> 06:05.507
The music is for effect.

06:05.509 --> 06:08.376
It's time and aggression...

06:08.378 --> 06:09.878
Technical wizardry.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.013
And it's shared live...

06:12.015 --> 06:14.382
and then it's over.

06:14.384 --> 06:18.253
The energy can't last.

06:18.255 --> 06:20.021
Unless you're Iggy Pop.

06:20.023 --> 06:21.589
Yeah, well good for him,
but I don't think I wanna

06:21.591 --> 06:24.459
be in my 70's still listening
to Minor Threat.

06:24.461 --> 06:26.895
- But Tiger does.
- I won't live to be 70, so...

06:28.031 --> 06:29.597
Okay, so, uh,
this is a good seg

06:29.599 --> 06:30.932
into one of my traditions.

06:30.934 --> 06:33.902
Uh, for each of you,
name your desert island band.

06:33.904 --> 06:35.437
Only one?

06:36.540 --> 06:38.540
If I were to
say Black Sabbath,

06:38.542 --> 06:40.942
would I get
Ozzy and Dio?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.311
No caveats.
Just name the band.

06:43.313 --> 06:44.412
Okay.

06:45.983 --> 06:47.215
Misfits.

06:47.217 --> 06:48.950
No, The Damned.

06:48.952 --> 06:50.452
- Um...
- Oh, fuck it. Misfits.

06:50.454 --> 06:52.387
- Poison Idea.
- Cro-Mags.

06:52.389 --> 06:54.055
That's a good one also.

06:54.057 --> 06:55.557
Why don't you say
something, dude?

06:55.559 --> 06:58.026
What about Steely Dan?

06:58.028 --> 07:00.495
- Hm. No, Candlebox.
- He's a juggalo.

07:00.497 --> 07:04.265
- Uh... uh...
- Britney Spears?

07:05.202 --> 07:07.002
Hey... hey, you...
you... you're gonna

07:07.004 --> 07:08.703
edit this, right?
I can chop it up a bit.

07:08.705 --> 07:11.706
- Oh, you should let it go raw, man.
- Um, when is this gonna air?

07:11.708 --> 07:13.575
Like, maybe we should
plug the show?

07:13.577 --> 07:15.710
Yeah. Um...

07:18.382 --> 07:21.149
My last show at The Muni Center
didn't end well.

07:21.151 --> 07:25.020
Uh, lots of vomit,
some fecal matter.

07:25.022 --> 07:27.255
County commissioner got wind
and pulled my permit.

07:27.257 --> 07:29.657
You guys were
already en route.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.027
No, you gotta
give us a kill fee.

07:32.029 --> 07:35.296
- We went 90 miles out of our way.
- I've got a backup lined up.

07:35.298 --> 07:37.499
Um, lunch,
50% cut on the door,

07:37.501 --> 07:39.167
and you guys would headline.

07:40.237 --> 07:42.003

- Christ.
- Now easy there, jiu-jitsu.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.861
Yeah. We don't wanna
go to jail, too.

08:41.097 --> 08:43.798
I think you just ended this tour.
Fuck yes. Let's call it.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.602
All right, so we'd
have to beeline to DC.

08:47.604 --> 08:49.037
We have enough
for one tank.

08:49.039 --> 08:50.338
We'd have to siphon
the rest of the way.

08:50.340 --> 08:51.339
That's not a problem.

08:51.341 --> 08:53.241
We got rice and beans.

08:53.243 --> 08:55.743
We can head up north.
Take the 80 all the way.

08:55.745 --> 08:57.245
What the fuck
you doing, man?

08:57.247 --> 08:59.347
Let me call my cousin.

08:59.349 --> 09:00.782
I can get you guys
a solid gig.

09:00.784 --> 09:02.317
Where? Here?

09:02.319 --> 09:03.351
Scene is dead.

09:03.353 --> 09:05.433
You'd have to dip
down closer to Portland.

09:10.827 --> 09:13.328
I say we just gank his vinyl.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.366
All right, so all set.

09:18.368 --> 09:20.502
Uh, matinée tomorrow.

09:20.504 --> 09:22.403
Door's at 1:00,
you guys are on at 3:00.

09:22.405 --> 09:24.239
- I texted the addy.
- How much?

09:24.241 --> 09:25.640
Uh, $350.

09:25.642 --> 09:27.142
Minus your tab.

09:27.144 --> 09:30.612
And, um, just so you know,
it's mostly boots and braces down there.

09:30.614 --> 09:32.113
Skins? There's some
at every show.

09:32.115 --> 09:33.848
What? D.M.S.? Sharp?

09:33.850 --> 09:36.317
Uh, right-wing,
or technically ultra-left,

09:36.319 --> 09:37.852
but not affiliated.

09:37.854 --> 09:40.321
- And your cousin's cool?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:40.323 --> 09:42.657
Uh, don't talk politics,
but stick with Daniel.

09:42.659 --> 09:45.160
I'd tag along, but he and his
girl are coming here to crash.

09:45.162 --> 09:46.194
Gotta vacuum and shit.

09:46.196 --> 09:48.296
So they're not,
like, burning crosses

09:48.298 --> 09:50.298
or anything, right?
Like, we just play rock?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.133
Uh, I'd play
your earlier stuff.

09:52.135 --> 09:53.801
Heavier stuff.

09:55.205 --> 09:58.873
I usually keep the originals,
but since this one never happened...

09:58.875 --> 10:00.508
Can I still
run that interview?

10:00.510 --> 10:01.743
Yeah.

10:01.745 --> 10:03.178
What station is it on?

10:03.180 --> 10:04.779
Uh, FM 85.5.

10:04.781 --> 10:06.347
Breakfast With Champions.

10:06.349 --> 10:07.749
- Thanks.
- Yo, Tadpole...

10:07.751 --> 10:10.185
I'm sorry I almost
obliterated you, man.

10:11.488 --> 10:12.587
Not a problem.

10:14.624 --> 10:15.790
Take it easy.

10:27.904 --> 10:29.871
At least the dude can draw.

10:34.678 --> 10:36.344
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

10:44.688 --> 10:45.820
Yo, Pat...

10:47.624 --> 10:49.905
you know, there's something
I've never told people...

10:51.761 --> 10:53.628
or anyone,
for that matter.

10:55.198 --> 10:56.431
What?

11:02.672 --> 11:04.772
Was that real? Ew!

11:04.774 --> 11:05.940
Open your window.

11:05.942 --> 11:07.382
Good.

12:26.923 --> 12:28.456
You Tad's friends?

12:28.458 --> 12:29.590
Uh, he sent us.

12:29.592 --> 12:30.992
Are you Cousin Dan?

12:30.994 --> 12:32.593
Daniel.

12:32.595 --> 12:33.945
You guys look hammered.

12:33.946 --> 12:35.296
One night at Tad's
will do that to you.

12:35.298 --> 12:36.731
And if your girl's
gonna be crashing...

12:36.733 --> 12:38.266
Don't mention that.

12:38.268 --> 12:40.435
- Okay, I was just...
- Yeah, no worries whatsoever.

12:40.437 --> 12:42.637

it him and me and her. Yeah.

19:12.962 --> 19:14.061
Yes.

19:14.063 --> 19:15.830
Yes, ma'am.

19:18.835 --> 19:20.067
Did you call Darcy?

19:20.069 --> 19:22.770
He's on his way.
He knows about that...

19:22.772 --> 19:24.739
not this.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.707
- You can't keep us here, man. You gotta let us go.
- We're not keeping you.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.142
You're just staying.

19:29.879 --> 19:31.712
You're up.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

19:31.714 --> 19:32.813

19:33.916 --> 19:35.683
Everyone, just relax.

19:35.685 --> 19:37.118
Cops are coming.

19:44.026 --> 19:46.227
- See how easy that is?
- Motherfucker!

19:46.229 --> 19:48.696
Look what you did!
Amber, chill the fuck out!

19:48.698 --> 19:50.898
Yes. Please.

19:55.271 --> 19:56.470
- Darcy here?
- Not yet.

19:56.472 --> 19:58.272
I need $600 cash.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.374
You just signed out $350.

20:00.376 --> 20:02.243
Somebody's dead.

20:05.348 --> 20:07.114
Still gotta keep the books.

20:12.989 --> 20:14.789
What else do you need?

20:14.791 --> 20:16.490
A true believer.

20:16.492 --> 20:18.259
How 'bout two?

20:26.936 --> 20:28.869
Maybe she's not dead.

20:28.871 --> 20:29.970
I'm just saying.

20:29.972 --> 20:31.906
Like, there's not
a lot of blood.

20:31.908 --> 20:34.909
You know, so, like,
maybe she's just...

20:34.911 --> 20:36.811
and who are we
to say that she's...

20:36.813 --> 20:37.845
Oh, shit!

20:42.118 --> 20:43.150
Come on, man.

20:43.152 --> 20:46.153
What are you doing?

20:46.155 --> 20:48.255
The fuck, man?

20:48.257 --> 20:50.024
There it is.

20:50.026 --> 20:51.559
Oh, my God.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.834
We gotta go.
We gotta fucking go right now.

20:59.836 --> 21:01.535
Now we didn't see shit.

21:03.005 --> 21:05.039
We... we...
we were so drunk.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.842
All right, just wait, okay?

21:07.844 --> 21:10.477
Cops are on the way.

21:10.479 --> 21:12.079
Above and beyond, gentlemen.

21:12.081 --> 21:14.348
You need me to do it?

21:14.350 --> 21:17.284
- Nope.
- Won't even be the first time.

21:18.521 --> 21:20.221
Hurry up.

21:20.223 --> 21:22.103
Go.

21:24.994 --> 21:26.460
All right, that's it.

21:27.463 --> 21:29.930
Okay, let me see it.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.999
The knife.

21:32.001 --> 21:33.901
It's an inch too short
for felony possession,

21:33.903 --> 21:36.103
so you don't have to worry
about the...

21:36.105 --> 21:37.538
Actually, give me
that money back.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.839
What?

21:38.841 --> 21:39.940
It's like vouchers
and shit.

21:39.942 --> 21:41.822
We'll hold it for you.
Come on.

21:44.146 --> 21:46.106
If you do any time,
we'll double it.

21:55.291 --> 21:56.423
Now talk to 'em.

22:02.832 --> 22:04.231
- You the victim?
- Yes, officer.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.366
Kneel down.

22:05.368 --> 22:07.168
Both of you,
ankles crossed.

22:11.007 --> 22:12.439
That's the owner.

22:12.441 --> 22:14.642
I called him too.

22:16.479 --> 22:19.847
All right, let's give them
some room to work, folks.

22:19.849 --> 22:21.382
Are you the owner?

22:21.384 --> 22:23.183
Yes, ma'am.

22:46.075 --> 22:48.042
Cowcatcher, clear out.

22:48.044 --> 22:50.277
Hey, where are the cops?

22:50.279 --> 22:53.113
- Get your stuff, man.
- What about us?

22:53.115 --> 22:54.348
What are you doing?

22:54.350 --> 22:57.451
We're sorting it out.
Just hang tight, Amber.

23:08.264 --> 23:10.164
Your set was pretty good.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.033
What?

23:16.572 --> 23:20.341
What was the name
of your second to last song?

23:21.944 --> 23:23.077
Uh...

23:25.214 --> 23:26.981
To... Toxic Evolution.

23:29.518 --> 23:31.151
It's fucking hard, man.

23:32.421 --> 23:35.522
That's the one
I did her to.

23:48.404 --> 23:51.505
All right, he's got
six bullets...

23:51.507 --> 23:53.407
- For real?
- ...if we all go at once...

23:53.409 --> 23:55.275
- Guys, hold off a sec.
- For what?

23:55.277 --> 23:57.478
- We haven't done anything!
- It doesn't matter.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.948
Okay.
They're called cartridges.

24:00.950 --> 24:04.284
The bullet is the part
that enters your brain

24:04.286 --> 24:06.553
if you keep talking shit.

24:06.555 --> 24:10.657
And this gun only has
five cartridges, not six,

24:10.659 --> 24:14.695
'cause they're big as fuck
and only five fit the cylinder.

24:16.098 --> 24:21.035
So, please shut the fuck up
and don't test me.

24:21.037 --> 24:22.436
Reece, you're making it worse.

24:22.438 --> 24:25.706
We sit and we wait.

24:25.708 --> 24:27.408
And we die?

24:27.410 --> 24:30.110
Not if you sit
and you wait.

24:30.112 --> 24:33.047
It's just the one
to 911 at 3:45

24:33.049 --> 24:35.689
and then mine was at 3:47.
You called?

24:36.252 --> 24:38.152
- 911 called back and I answered.
- Be clear.

24:38.154 --> 24:40.721
Who else knows besides...
You said Daniel's cousin?

24:40.723 --> 24:42.173
Tad.

24:42.174 --> 24:43.624
There was a text from him
last night with our address,

24:43.626 --> 24:44.691
but he doesn't know anything.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.494
Except who they are,
where they are...

24:47.496 --> 24:50.464
maybe where
they're supposed to be next.

24:50.466 --> 24:51.832
Fuck.

24:53.135 --> 24:54.435
Check emails.

24:54.437 --> 24:56.637
They played their set
to the crowd.

24:56.639 --> 24:58.639
Then we'll assume
the wide world knows

24:58.641 --> 25:00.741
and they'll be tracking that.

25:00.743 --> 25:02.176
Give it to me.

25:02.178 --> 25:03.544
I was trying to
buy some time

25:03.546 --> 25:05.279
and contain this
until we could...

25:05.281 --> 25:07.014
Contain?

25:07.016 --> 25:08.348
It was pretty rapid fire.

25:08.350 --> 25:13.120
I appreciate your initiative
and we all love Werm.

25:13.122 --> 25:14.421
He's a brother.

25:14.423 --> 25:17.091
And you might have
visited him in prison.

25:18.327 --> 25:19.693
Makes a difference.

25:20.796 --> 25:23.297
Now we're all
in the stew

25:23.299 --> 25:25.699
for an impulsive act,

25:25.701 --> 25:28.202
for a selfish act,

25:28.204 --> 25:31.071
under my roof.

25:31.073 --> 25:33.373
You see a way
out of this?

25:33.375 --> 25:35.742
For them?

25:35.744 --> 25:37.111
No.

25:37.113 --> 25:38.512
We still have to find one.

25:42.284 --> 25:45.352
Okay. This is good.

25:47.656 --> 25:50.107
No guns.

25:50.108 --> 25:52.559
You have a "No trespassing" sign
posted at the residence?

25:52.561 --> 25:54.161
We got
"Beware of dogs."

25:54.163 --> 25:55.462
That's better.

26:01.504 --> 26:03.604
Does anyone even
know we're in here?

26:03.606 --> 26:06.440
No one who cares. Tad?

26:10.446 --> 26:13.280
- I think we go.
- I think we go too.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.084
The next person that moves...

26:17.086 --> 26:19.086
Everyone okay?

26:19.088 --> 26:21.121
Just about.

26:21.123 --> 26:22.422
Gabe?

26:22.424 --> 26:23.524
- Yeah. Open up.
- No!

26:23.526 --> 26:24.825
- Where are the cops?
- Okay...

26:24.827 --> 26:26.093
do you want
me to open the door,

26:26.095 --> 26:28.228
or do you want me to blow
your fucking head off?

26:28.230 --> 26:31.231
- Back the fuck off!
- What's going on?

26:31.233 --> 26:32.332
They're trying to run at me!

26:32.334 --> 26:33.500
Do not shoot them!

26:33.501 --> 26:34.667
You know what?
That's on them.

26:34.670 --> 26:35.669
Where are the cops?

26:35.671 --> 26:37.271
Give them the gun!

26:37.273 --> 26:39.473
Say again?

26:39.475 --> 26:41.141
It's over!

26:41.143 --> 26:42.543
Give them the gun.

26:42.545 --> 26:44.811
Okay, I told you they just
tried to run at me...

26:44.813 --> 26:46.380
Then take the bullets out!

26:46.382 --> 26:47.581
Just hand it over now!

26:47.583 --> 26:49.550
Do not shoot them!

26:49.552 --> 26:50.918
Is Darcy here?

26:52.421 --> 26:54.154
- He is.
- I am.

26:54.156 --> 26:58.525
Gentlemen, I'm the owner.
Okay, why the fuck didn't you just tell me?

26:58.527 --> 26:59.893
Truly sorry about this.

26:59.895 --> 27:01.895
Playing catch-up here myself.

27:01.897 --> 27:03.597
They're playing
a fucking show.

27:03.599 --> 27:05.766
Uh...

27:05.768 --> 27:08.368
thank you, but...

27:08.370 --> 27:10.170
we open the door
for the police,

27:10.172 --> 27:12.506
or we keep the bullets.

27:12.508 --> 27:15.342
Uh, the cartridges.

27:15.344 --> 27:16.610
I've got no problem with that.

27:16.612 --> 27:18.745
Okay, I handed them the gun.

27:18.747 --> 27:20.514
I'm gonna head out now.
No, you're not.

27:20.516 --> 27:22.366
- Let him open the door.
- Hang on.

27:22.367 --> 27:24.217
- No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun...
- Nobody is...

27:24.220 --> 27:27.154
letting me do anything.
I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?

27:27.156 --> 27:28.488
- So how are we doing?
- He's right.

27:28.490 --> 27:30.390
Pat, do the math.

27:30.392 --> 27:34.428
- Where are the police?
- It takes a while out here.

27:34.430 --> 27:37.698
- Stay back.
- Just want to make sure that no one else gets hurt

27:37.700 --> 27:39.733
in the meantime.

27:39.734 --> 27:42.694
Okay, I gave you the damn gun...

27:43.405 --> 27:45.872
Tiger!

27:48.944 --> 27:50.377
- Get him down!
- Justin?

27:50.379 --> 27:51.645
Get him down!

27:54.350 --> 27:56.070
What's happening?

28:01.724 --> 28:02.723
Shh!

28:02.725 --> 28:04.258
Justin?

28:04.260 --> 28:06.893
Shouldn't have locked the door.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.328
Shit. Sam!

28:12.801 --> 28:13.801
Get the bullets!

28:18.507 --> 28:19.923
All right, load the gun.

28:19.924 --> 28:21.340
- How's it going in there?
- Not good!

28:21.343 --> 28:24.778
Fine, but we would rather
wait for the police!

28:24.780 --> 28:26.313
Justin?

28:26.315 --> 28:27.955
He's fine...

28:29.485 --> 28:30.884
but he's gonna wait too!

28:34.390 --> 28:35.722
Understood, gentlemen.

28:36.892 --> 28:37.892
Hold tight.

28:40.229 --> 28:41.762
You think they know?

28:41.764 --> 28:43.597
I think they're
smarter than you!

28:43.599 --> 28:44.665
Darcy...

28:45.768 --> 28:46.800
Man.

28:49.638 --> 28:50.638
I apologize.

28:53.876 --> 28:56.637
We'll do it here.
Stage it up the road. Okay.

29:04.386 --> 29:07.387
- Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?
- So in a tournament,

29:07.389 --> 29:11.291
I snap his arm or he taps out
and we all go get burgers.

29:11.293 --> 29:12.859
- Snap it.
- Come on.

29:12.861 --> 29:14.411
Look, we've got the gun.

29:14.412 --> 29:15.962
Why don't we just let him...
Wait, wait. I don't want it.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.631
All right? I don't...
I don't feel good with it.

29:17.633 --> 29:18.932
Who wants it?

29:18.934 --> 29:19.866
- Not me.
- Hm?

29:19.868 --> 29:21.735
- No. I can't shoot.
- I can.

29:21.737 --> 29:22.903
No, not you.

29:22.905 --> 29:24.838
- Then fucking keep it.
- Keep it, Sam.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.273
I'll take it
when I'm up.

29:26.275 --> 29:27.507
When I let go...

29:27.509 --> 29:28.909
what are you gonna do?

29:30.012 --> 29:31.545
Butt-fuck everyone
in the room.

29:32.915 --> 29:35.716
You're gonna sit
criss-cross applesauce.

29:36.952 --> 29:37.951
Say it.

29:37.953 --> 29:41.088
I'm gonna sit
criss-cross apple sau...

29:43.759 --> 29:45.058
Nice.

29:45.060 --> 29:46.460
Now lean against the chair.

29:48.630 --> 29:50.864
Hey, is there another
way out of here?

29:50.866 --> 29:52.099
No.

29:53.936 --> 29:56.336
You fed 'em yet today?

29:56.338 --> 29:57.604
It doesn't matter.

29:57.606 --> 29:59.005
They're professionals.

29:59.007 --> 30:00.774
You might lose
a couple by morning

30:00.776 --> 30:01.942
Maybe a bunch.

30:01.944 --> 30:03.577
Like I said, they're pros.

30:03.579 --> 30:05.445
They earn.

30:05.447 --> 30:07.013
You'll be compensated.

30:07.015 --> 30:09.716
Christ. How many people
are on that list?

30:13.956 --> 30:15.555
It's 1,200 for a prospect,

30:15.557 --> 30:17.557
two for a bait dog.

30:17.559 --> 30:19.860
No studs, no champs
unless you wanna pay

30:19.862 --> 30:21.712
20 grand a head.

30:21.713 --> 30:23.563
This might cost you
your livelihood, Clark.

30:23.565 --> 30:26.466
As long as it doesn't
cost me mine, you're covered.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.935
There are gonna be cops,
so clean up the residence.

30:29.938 --> 30:31.972
Maybe leave a roach
in an ashtray.

30:31.974 --> 30:35.509
Put Daniel on that door
and bring the van around.

30:35.511 --> 30:36.810
Shit.

30:36.812 --> 30:38.011
The keys.

30:39.014 --> 30:40.847
They're with them,
I guess.

30:40.849 --> 30:42.048
I don't know.
We need them.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.050
I got a ton
of shit to do.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.452
Go on.

30:45.454 --> 30:47.687
This is a fire hazard.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.894
I wouldn't put
Daniel on the door.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.062
Fine. Plenty to do.

30:57.566 --> 30:58.598
Where's Daniel?

30:58.600 --> 31:00.440
He stepped out.
I'm covering.

31:02.771 --> 31:03.970
Everything okay?

31:10.779 --> 31:12.946
Meet me
at the utility shed.

31:23.892 --> 31:25.859
This a new ride?

31:25.861 --> 31:26.993
Yeah.

31:26.995 --> 31:28.662
Just turning it over.

31:28.664 --> 31:29.796
I think it's getting choked.

31:29.798 --> 31:30.764
Wrong filter.

31:30.766 --> 31:32.699
- She's a beaut.
- What's up?

31:32.701 --> 31:34.167
Need some
of the squad.

31:34.169 --> 31:35.635
Red laces only.

31:35.637 --> 31:37.537
- Tonight?
- Now.

31:37.539 --> 31:38.672
The list.

31:41.443 --> 31:42.609
This is everybody
who knows?

31:42.611 --> 31:43.977
Yeah. Including the band.

31:43.979 --> 31:45.078
Knows what?

31:45.080 --> 31:46.513
Manageable.

31:46.515 --> 31:49.483
From here on out,
not a single name gets added

31:49.485 --> 31:50.951
unless they have red laces.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.652
There's 80 people in there.

31:52.654 --> 31:54.588
You plus four.

31:54.590 --> 31:57.691
Give Gabe the keys
in case we have to play valet.

31:59.561 --> 32:00.961
We're losing light.

32:03.732 --> 32:05.572
- You got it?
- Yeah.

32:08.103 --> 32:09.169
Whoa, watch out!

32:09.171 --> 32:10.570
That could be asbestos.

32:10.572 --> 32:12.639
- It's not asbestos.
- You don't have a phone, do you?

32:12.641 --> 32:14.174
They took it.

32:16.111 --> 32:19.212
Hers too.
I'm gonna search her, okay?

32:24.219 --> 32:26.653
Careful. That one
could be a live wire.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.455
It's a speaker wire.

32:42.004 --> 32:44.004
What'd you find?

32:44.006 --> 32:45.446
Uh...

32:47.976 --> 32:49.242
<i>"Fleisch Wolf"?</i>

32:49.244 --> 32:51.611
Uh... <i>fleisch</i> means...

32:51.613 --> 32:52.946
uh, flesh.

32:52.948 --> 32:54.514
Or meat.

32:54.516 --> 32:56.116
Like a <i>fleisch</i> salad.
It's German.

32:56.118 --> 32:58.218
So "Meat Wolf"?

32:58.220 --> 32:59.660
Yeah.

33:02.624 --> 33:04.090
This shit's solid.

33:04.092 --> 33:06.012
- Great.
- There's nothing here.

33:08.797 --> 33:11.798
Okay. Empty out your pockets.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.920
Come search me, faggot.

33:13.969 --> 33:15.001
Just shoot him.

33:16.672 --> 33:17.971
Come on.

33:19.508 --> 33:20.840
Can I get up?

33:20.842 --> 33:22.482
On the chair.

33:23.812 --> 33:25.612
Slowly. Slowly.

33:43.599 --> 33:45.599
Turn 'em out.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.270
Come on, man.
Other one.

33:55.177 --> 33:56.209
Oh fuck.

33:56.211 --> 33:58.244
Good call.

33:58.246 --> 33:59.913
Turn it out,
for fuck's sake.

34:01.717 --> 34:02.949
What is that?
Give that to me.

34:02.951 --> 34:04.851
Hand it over!

34:04.853 --> 34:06.086
Oops.

34:06.088 --> 34:07.787
Wait, was that a phone?

34:07.789 --> 34:10.223
Oh, shit. Point it... point it at the door.

34:10.225 --> 34:12.626
- Point the gun at the door.
- Maybe it's the police. It's a raid.

34:12.628 --> 34:14.293
- Are you serious?
- Shh!

34:14.295 --> 34:15.960
- Fuck off, Ilsa!
- Yo, quiet, okay? Justin, don't move.

34:15.964 --> 34:17.297
- Point the gun...
- Nobody move.

34:17.299 --> 34:19.132
- Now if we get all behind...
- Nobody talk!

34:19.134 --> 34:20.233
Careful now.

34:34.882 --> 34:36.081
Smoke this.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.453
Deal.

34:40.722 --> 34:44.090
And if the cherry does
something that you don't like...

34:44.092 --> 34:45.692
shoot.

34:46.695 --> 34:48.415
Thank you, Amber.

34:51.733 --> 34:53.199
Get comfortable.

35:02.277 --> 35:04.110
Pretty smart for a Nazi.

35:04.112 --> 35:05.792
I'm not a Nazi.

35:06.882 --> 35:09.442
How do you fall
for this shit?

35:10.385 --> 35:13.353
Let's just say the people who
were gonna hurt me weren't white.

35:13.355 --> 35:15.121
Any of them women?

35:15.123 --> 35:17.257
It's a problem
where I grew up.

35:17.259 --> 35:19.359
- Guys.
- What about tonight?

35:19.361 --> 35:21.094
I think we got a white people
- Reece: Guys! Shh.

35:21.096 --> 35:22.736
Oh, fuck you.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.350
It looks like we tripped our main.

35:44.352 --> 35:46.953
Our back-up gennie is fired up,
but we're gonna to have to

35:46.955 --> 35:49.189
call it a day
and do some troubleshooting.

35:49.191 --> 35:51.124
We'll try again on Sunday.

35:51.126 --> 35:52.325
No door charge.

35:52.327 --> 35:55.261
Hell, free drinks from 2:00 to 4:00.

36:10.045 --> 36:14.080
Those of you attending the racial
advocacy workshop on Wednesday,

36:14.082 --> 36:16.816
assume it's on
unless you hear otherwise.

36:16.818 --> 36:18.418
And remember...

36:19.888 --> 36:22.222
this is a movement,
not a party.

36:22.224 --> 36:23.389
All right.

36:23.391 --> 36:25.492
Stay safe!
Godspeed.

36:28.096 --> 36:29.429
Who hasn't smoked yet?

36:32.801 --> 36:34.881
All right, you guys are
gonna come with me.

36:52.721 --> 36:54.601
You're not
worried they'll talk?

36:55.390 --> 36:57.023
They've got priorities.

37:00.929 --> 37:04.464
Tell them the party is on us if
they hole up for a couple of days.

37:04.466 --> 37:06.800
Put this fire out first.

37:06.802 --> 37:08.134
Grove Street?

37:08.136 --> 37:11.905
My dope nigger stamps
in case one of these meat-heads

37:11.907 --> 37:13.940
gets booked
for possession.

37:13.942 --> 37:16.009
All right.

37:16.011 --> 37:18.144
Let's get y'all
somewhere safe.

37:30.525 --> 37:32.392
Treasure?

37:32.394 --> 37:35.028
Daylight. Underneath.

37:36.898 --> 37:39.432
They're moving our gear.

37:41.536 --> 37:43.403
- Yes?
- Gentlemen?

37:43.405 --> 37:45.338
We're loading you out.

37:45.340 --> 37:47.307
Are there cops here?

37:47.309 --> 37:50.510
They've come and gone.
It got a little complicated.

37:50.512 --> 37:52.545
We're so fucked.

37:52.547 --> 37:55.315
Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

37:55.317 --> 37:59.352
Can you hear me
if I speak at this volume?

37:59.354 --> 38:00.520
- Yeah.
- Yes.

38:00.522 --> 38:01.888
Good.

38:01.890 --> 38:02.889
Um...

38:02.891 --> 38:06.059
and can we please
elect just one voice?

38:09.865 --> 38:10.997
Yes.

38:10.999 --> 38:14.033
Okay. Now, you're trapped.

38:14.035 --> 38:15.835
That's not a threat.
It's a fact.

38:15.837 --> 38:17.871
Well, we have a loaded gun.

38:17.873 --> 38:19.439
That's also just a fact.

38:19.441 --> 38:22.342
Oh, we have plenty
more guns on hand.

38:22.344 --> 38:25.011
We just want you out.

38:25.013 --> 38:26.346
Not harmed.

38:27.382 --> 38:31.885
Now, the firearm you have
is not registered.

38:31.887 --> 38:35.955
I wanted it out of the picture
before the authorities arrived,

38:35.957 --> 38:37.924
but you refused,
so here we are.

38:37.926 --> 38:39.292
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

38:39.294 --> 38:41.928
Here we are.

38:41.930 --> 38:45.031
Oh, I do apologize for
my associates. They panicked.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.433
- Yeah, no shit! Man, we're...
- Listen! Listen!

38:49.204 --> 38:51.471
No one is trying
to wipe the slate clean.

38:52.874 --> 38:56.910
Whatever you saw or did
is no longer my concern.

38:56.912 --> 38:59.112
You tell whoever you want
whatever you want.

38:59.114 --> 39:03.516
All I ask is that you
understand you were held here

39:03.518 --> 39:07.487
for your own safety
before you were released.

39:11.626 --> 39:12.926
Okay.

39:14.095 --> 39:16.262
Yes. Thank you.

39:16.264 --> 39:18.398
But just...

39:18.400 --> 39:21.601
just to be clear...

39:21.603 --> 39:23.202
the police are coming back?

39:23.204 --> 39:25.071
They've come and gone.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.573
Well, that's what
concerns us, man!

39:27.575 --> 39:30.710
I just want that gun
out of the picture.

39:36.051 --> 39:37.383
Okay.

39:38.553 --> 39:40.954
- Careful, man.
- Sorry.

39:40.956 --> 39:43.189
- What do we do?
- We dig through the fucking floor.

39:43.191 --> 39:44.791
While we just wait?

39:44.792 --> 39:46.392
They could shoot us at any time.
Yeah, but they haven't.

39:46.394 --> 39:48.027
How do we even know
that they have guns?

39:48.029 --> 39:50.129
They have guns.
No question.

39:50.131 --> 39:51.597
We're gonna trust you?

39:51.599 --> 39:55.501
- We've got zero leverage.
- Ask for a phone...

39:55.503 --> 39:58.004
for the gun.
All right.

39:58.006 --> 40:00.640
- What about him?
- Yeah, I mean, the minute we give it up,

40:00.642 --> 40:02.962
what if he just, like, attacks?
Then I'll wrap him up.

40:04.346 --> 40:05.278
Okay.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.580
So we see what they think?
Mmhmm.

40:10.251 --> 40:11.985
All right.

40:11.987 --> 40:17.223
Uh, we'll give you
the gun for a cell phone.

40:17.225 --> 40:18.658
Sorry, no.

40:18.660 --> 40:22.495
- Okay, well, how about a registered firearm?
- Funny.

40:22.497 --> 40:25.131
Justin, you alive and well?

40:25.133 --> 40:27.633
- I'm alive.
- Okay, good.

40:27.635 --> 40:32.472
Gentlemen, I hope
you appreciate the situation.

40:32.474 --> 40:36.509
Things have gone south,
no doubt.

40:36.511 --> 40:41.180
But you know if you don't
hand over that gun,

40:41.182 --> 40:43.583
it won't end well.

40:43.585 --> 40:45.385
You see...

40:45.387 --> 40:49.188
for all I know, I...
I come to my place of business

40:49.190 --> 40:51.224
and there is
an out of town band

40:51.226 --> 40:53.726
locked in a room
with an unregistered firearm.

40:53.728 --> 40:56.295
- Oh, come on!
- And somebody's hurt inside there

40:56.297 --> 40:59.365
and maybe there's
a hostage, too!

41:00.702 --> 41:02.235
So what do I do?

41:03.738 --> 41:07.006
Am I within my rights
to intervene?

41:07.008 --> 41:09.642
Should I kick down the door
and start shooting?

41:09.644 --> 41:12.345
Or...

41:12.347 --> 41:16.649
can we just remove
the guns from the equation?

41:16.651 --> 41:18.751
These are my questions.

41:18.753 --> 41:21.421
You've got
30 seconds to answer.

41:21.423 --> 41:24.624
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

41:24.626 --> 41:27.560
Great. Anyone got
any smart ideas?

41:27.562 --> 41:29.462
Justin, get on the floor.

41:31.499 --> 41:34.133
Get on the fuckin' floor
right now. Go.

41:36.571 --> 41:39.038
All right. Sam,
come around here.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.574
- Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me.
- Okay.

41:41.576 --> 41:43.456
- You got it?
- Got it.

41:44.045 --> 41:45.778
Okay. Nice and easy.

41:45.780 --> 41:48.081
Play nice,
and I'll be nice.

41:48.083 --> 41:49.449
Please.

41:49.451 --> 41:51.001
Don't do anything.

41:51.002 --> 41:52.552
- This is fuckin' retarded.
- No one's saying it isn't,

41:52.554 --> 41:55.121
but we either hand over the gun
or we open fire with it.

41:55.123 --> 41:58.191
- I vote for that.
- You don't have a vote, okay?

41:58.193 --> 42:00.226
I mean we're taking
chances either way, so...

42:00.228 --> 42:01.461
So we're fuckin' dead, guys.

42:01.463 --> 42:03.362
At least this way,
we find out

42:03.364 --> 42:05.565
if all we're doing now
is buying time.

42:05.567 --> 42:07.066
- For them.
- Amen.

42:07.068 --> 42:09.235
At this point,
I'm just fucking curious.

42:13.274 --> 42:17.543
Okay...
we'll give you the gun.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.380
But we're gonna
keep the ammo.

42:21.382 --> 42:23.816
Fine. Safer for everyone.

42:25.253 --> 42:27.053
All right, let's move
this fucking couch.

42:27.055 --> 42:28.495
Okay.

42:40.602 --> 42:43.469
All right, keep still.

42:46.841 --> 42:48.741
Okay, stand back!

42:48.743 --> 42:50.423
You've got it.

42:55.083 --> 42:56.616
Here we go.

43:04.692 --> 43:06.092
May I approach?

43:06.094 --> 43:07.460
No!

43:07.462 --> 43:09.462
No. I'm gonna throw it.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.898
Careful. It was a gift.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.773
- They're killing us!
- Keep the gun!

43:23.478 --> 43:25.378
Get the fuck off of me!

43:25.380 --> 43:27.813
Okay, okay!

43:27.815 --> 43:30.249
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

43:38.693 --> 43:40.560
Fuck you!

43:42.163 --> 43:44.163
Oh, my God!

43:44.165 --> 43:45.831
Keep it up! Pull it up!

43:45.833 --> 43:47.333
Oh fuck.

43:49.137 --> 43:50.937
Yo, help me
move the couch.

43:54.509 --> 43:55.408
Help me move it!

43:55.410 --> 43:57.510
Oh, shit!

44:00.315 --> 44:02.582
This will be over soon, gentlemen.

44:09.524 --> 44:11.624
I'll fuckin' crush you.

44:21.536 --> 44:23.296
Get the box cutter!

44:25.406 --> 44:27.273
Get the fucking box cutter
out of his hand!

44:33.648 --> 44:35.815
- Tell me when he's out!
- Okay!

44:35.817 --> 44:37.950
Pat! Pat!

44:37.952 --> 44:39.485
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

44:39.487 --> 44:40.686
Shush! Shush!

44:40.688 --> 44:41.854
Shush!

44:43.358 --> 44:45.658
He's out. He's out!

44:48.896 --> 44:50.630
Oh, fuck.

44:50.632 --> 44:53.833
Put pressure on it!
Put pressure!

44:53.835 --> 44:55.368
I know, I know, I know.

44:55.370 --> 44:57.637
Just breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

44:57.639 --> 44:59.939
He's not out!

44:59.941 --> 45:00.973
He's not out!

45:03.911 --> 45:05.444
You got this?

45:26.301 --> 45:28.334
How long does it take...

45:28.336 --> 45:31.404
until we know... for sure?

45:35.310 --> 45:37.443
What the...

45:37.445 --> 45:38.511
Oh, Jesus.

45:43.418 --> 45:44.750
Oh, Jesus.

45:54.529 --> 45:56.495
Any and all firearms,

45:56.497 --> 45:58.698
Clark will handle it
from here on.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.299
He give you an E.T.A.?

46:00.301 --> 46:01.934
You said no calls.

46:01.936 --> 46:03.636
Right. Good.

46:03.638 --> 46:05.304
Phones too.
What happened in there?

46:05.306 --> 46:07.106
Set Neal up for tomorrow

46:07.107 --> 46:08.907
New drywall, pour a floor.
Tell him we had a leak.

46:08.910 --> 46:11.310
Door with a frame, too.
What happened?

46:11.312 --> 46:13.646
Uh, a bit of
a maelstrom tonight.

46:13.648 --> 46:16.415
Visiting band hurt
one of ours.

46:16.417 --> 46:17.650
Who?

46:17.652 --> 46:19.352
Emily.

46:19.354 --> 46:21.287
Maybe Big Justin, too.

46:21.289 --> 46:22.421
What the fuck
are we doing then?

46:22.423 --> 46:24.490
Let's get in there.

46:24.492 --> 46:28.294
We're not coming apart
is what we are doing.

46:28.296 --> 46:33.332
We're saving questions until this
pig fuck is transferred off-site.

46:33.334 --> 46:35.835
Darcy.

46:35.837 --> 46:39.905
Okay. Last chance
if anyone needs to take a leak.

47:12.340 --> 47:14.340
I lost the gun.

47:14.342 --> 47:16.942
You held on longer
than I would have.

47:20.915 --> 47:22.381
Hey.

47:22.383 --> 47:23.916
I'm going.

47:23.918 --> 47:28.020
There's no air shaft,
there's no sewer system...

47:28.022 --> 47:30.456
no nothing.

47:31.626 --> 47:33.266
There it is.

47:37.665 --> 47:38.964
What time is it?

47:38.966 --> 47:40.466
It's not daylight.

47:40.468 --> 47:41.967
It's something.

47:41.969 --> 47:43.669
Out the way.

48:10.498 --> 48:12.198
Oh, fuck.

48:14.602 --> 48:16.235
Look for a door.

48:21.576 --> 48:23.256
Just let me know.

48:25.546 --> 48:26.546
Hey...

48:27.949 --> 48:31.484
I'm sorry
about your friend.

48:36.657 --> 48:38.958
Shit!

48:41.929 --> 48:43.696
Okay, move.

48:43.698 --> 48:45.178
Fuck!

48:57.745 --> 48:58.944
Is there a lock?

48:58.946 --> 49:01.847
Other side, maybe.

49:01.849 --> 49:03.849
We're burning time.

49:03.851 --> 49:05.084
Wait, but...

49:05.086 --> 49:07.119
Look! There's...
there's ventilation!

49:07.121 --> 49:08.654
Six inch ducts.
Good luck.

49:08.656 --> 49:10.456
Shouldn't we look around more?

49:10.458 --> 49:11.824
We just did!

49:11.826 --> 49:14.159
Go. Go, go. Push.

49:22.069 --> 49:23.836
Heroin.

49:23.838 --> 49:27.840
It's not about her or us.

49:30.645 --> 49:32.545
It's a... it's
a big ass bunker.

49:32.547 --> 49:34.246
- Give me your hand.
- Big ass dead end.

49:34.248 --> 49:35.748
Give it to me.
Hold it up, up, up.

49:35.750 --> 49:37.082
All right. Look away, look away.

49:37.084 --> 49:38.584
Maybe we can use this
to our advantage.

49:38.586 --> 49:40.186
We're done.

49:40.922 --> 49:43.456
I'm done.

49:43.457 --> 49:45.991
Okay? You can close the door behind
me if you want to strategize.

49:45.993 --> 49:48.694
- We're not ready!
- What do you think they're doing out there?

49:48.696 --> 49:50.629
- That's just it. We don't know.
- We fucking know

49:50.631 --> 49:52.031
they mean us harm!

49:52.033 --> 49:54.033
It's just that if have guns,

49:54.035 --> 49:55.834
okay, why haven't
they mowed us down already?

49:55.836 --> 49:57.836
We can't just go missing.

49:57.838 --> 49:59.505
They need us found.

49:59.507 --> 50:01.273
All right.
Grab some shit

50:01.275 --> 50:02.274
and get ready to run.

50:02.276 --> 50:03.642
Then we die.

50:03.644 --> 50:05.744
Yeah, but the longer we wait,

50:05.746 --> 50:07.246
the surer that is.

50:09.083 --> 50:10.950
- Tiger, you ready?
- Yeah, almost, man.

50:10.952 --> 50:14.353
We can't take it so seriously.

50:17.658 --> 50:20.526
We gotta...

50:20.528 --> 50:23.929
treat this like paintball.

50:25.733 --> 50:26.765
What?

50:28.536 --> 50:30.135
Rick Silva...

50:32.607 --> 50:37.676
helped organize the paintball
for Skate-o's bachelor party.

50:37.678 --> 50:41.914
And we were short a few players
to book the whole field,

50:41.916 --> 50:47.586
so they paired us up
with these ex-Marines.

50:47.588 --> 50:51.256
And the first few rounds,
these guys just...

50:51.258 --> 50:54.760
tore us to shreds.

50:54.762 --> 50:57.963
I mean, zero casualties
on their side.

50:57.965 --> 51:01.066
And I just cowered
behind these trees

51:01.068 --> 51:03.035
till I got shot.

51:03.037 --> 51:05.337
Covered in paint. But Rick...

51:05.339 --> 51:07.239
Tiger, you done?

51:09.577 --> 51:11.276
Okay.

51:11.278 --> 51:12.778
Pat, you're done, too.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.179
I'm sorry, man.
We gotta go.

51:14.181 --> 51:15.848
That's okay.

51:15.850 --> 51:17.883
- Was that a pep talk?
- Ready?

51:21.656 --> 51:23.856
Now we won't all live, but...

51:25.292 --> 51:27.393
I don't know.
Maybe we won't all die.

51:32.066 --> 51:35.634
- Here.
- No, I'm just gonna run.

51:35.636 --> 51:37.196
I got it.

51:38.839 --> 51:41.974
All right, fuck it.
Simon and Garfunkel.

51:44.111 --> 51:45.911
Desert island band.

51:48.082 --> 51:49.314
Prince.

51:52.086 --> 51:53.686
I, uh...

51:55.156 --> 51:57.256
- I'm still the Misfits.
- True school, man.

51:57.258 --> 51:58.891
Are we going?

52:00.995 --> 52:02.435
Yeah.

52:08.235 --> 52:12.871
Madonna and... Slayer.

52:14.942 --> 52:17.076
Here we go.

52:17.078 --> 52:18.177
Watch it!

52:21.782 --> 52:23.115
What the fuck?

52:24.652 --> 52:25.951
They're letting us out.

52:25.953 --> 52:27.186
How many exits are there?

52:27.188 --> 52:30.089
Uh, the main, the back,
maybe the kitchen.

52:30.091 --> 52:31.423
I always...
What about windows?

52:31.425 --> 52:32.858
See for yourselves.

52:34.361 --> 52:35.427
Fuck.

52:35.429 --> 52:36.762
Quiet.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.200
Oh, shit.

52:41.202 --> 52:43.035
Should we hide?

52:43.037 --> 52:45.104
Uh, whatever you want, man.

52:53.013 --> 52:54.747
We... we should split up.

52:54.749 --> 52:56.215
Totally.

53:05.392 --> 53:07.259
What the fuck?

53:07.261 --> 53:08.827
Tiger!

53:11.332 --> 53:13.966
Tiger!

53:18.139 --> 53:19.371
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

53:24.178 --> 53:25.344
Shit.

53:29.316 --> 53:30.916
Oh, shit!

53:34.488 --> 53:36.388
Save it.

53:36.390 --> 53:38.457
Oh, shit.

54:15.996 --> 54:17.896
<i>Fass! Fass!</i>

54:19.300 --> 54:21.500
<i>Voran! Fass!</i>

54:21.502 --> 54:22.835
<i>Fass!</i>

55:06.280 --> 55:07.512
Hey.

55:22.396 --> 55:24.396
They're everywhere!

55:24.398 --> 55:26.198
Where's Reece?

55:28.502 --> 55:30.022
It's us.

55:35.876 --> 55:38.010
Come on. Move.

55:40.214 --> 55:41.446
Sam, look.

55:45.252 --> 55:46.551
<i>Fleisch Wolf.</i>

55:46.553 --> 55:48.287
It's a song.

55:49.857 --> 55:51.590
It means "Meat Grinder."

55:53.494 --> 55:55.594
Up! Up!

55:55.596 --> 55:57.562
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

55:57.564 --> 55:59.064
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

55:59.066 --> 56:00.899
You're retiring him?

56:00.901 --> 56:02.935
He's worked up.

56:02.937 --> 56:04.202
Send in another.

56:04.204 --> 56:05.304
Send two.
Finish it.

56:05.306 --> 56:07.406
Kill that feedback first.

56:07.408 --> 56:10.642
And if I send in two fight dogs,
what do you think they'll do?

56:10.644 --> 56:12.611
Send me in there.
I'll finish up.

56:12.613 --> 56:14.212
Just give me the rules.

56:14.214 --> 56:15.580
All right.

56:17.584 --> 56:19.451
Blades only.

56:19.453 --> 56:21.453
Sloppy is fine.

56:21.455 --> 56:22.487
Try not to hit the bone.

56:22.489 --> 56:24.222
Okay.

56:24.224 --> 56:25.891
Take Jonathan.

56:25.893 --> 56:27.259
Brute squad.

56:27.261 --> 56:29.141
Keep him caged
until we tag out.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.666
He breathing?

56:41.342 --> 56:43.175
A little bit, yeah.

56:43.177 --> 56:45.410
Let him bleed.

56:45.412 --> 56:48.347
Later is better
for time of death.

56:48.349 --> 56:49.448
Keys?

56:49.450 --> 56:51.416
No.

57:23.684 --> 57:25.484
They're coming.

57:28.022 --> 57:29.554
I can't do this.

57:36.163 --> 57:37.562
Get back!

57:37.564 --> 57:39.698
No!

57:39.700 --> 57:41.166
Where's Emily?

57:47.274 --> 57:49.674
What the fuck
are you doing?

57:49.676 --> 57:51.143
Hey!

57:53.547 --> 57:55.147
Which one did it?

57:55.149 --> 57:56.648
- Werm did it.
- Bullshit.

57:56.650 --> 57:57.749
Which one?

57:57.751 --> 57:59.651
What did they tell you?

58:01.121 --> 58:03.522
What? You want to know?

58:03.524 --> 58:06.224
You want him to know?

58:06.226 --> 58:07.626
Know what?

58:07.628 --> 58:11.396
Werm found out
that she was leaving...

58:11.398 --> 58:14.466
but she didn't say
that it was with you.

58:16.336 --> 58:17.769
"Meat Grinder."

58:19.673 --> 58:22.607
That song was their cue.

58:24.178 --> 58:25.544
You should go.

58:35.289 --> 58:36.889
Here we go.

58:38.158 --> 58:39.724
This is taking too long.

58:42.162 --> 58:43.495
Gabe?

58:45.632 --> 58:48.733
You didn't want Daniel
on door duty.

58:48.735 --> 58:50.202
Why?

58:51.472 --> 58:54.739
Nothing concrete, he and...

58:54.741 --> 58:56.675
and Emily...

59:27.274 --> 59:29.374
Little lovebirds.

59:50.731 --> 59:52.230
Recognize this?

59:54.134 --> 59:55.133
No, sir.

59:55.135 --> 59:56.835
Of course not.
You were still handing out

59:56.837 --> 59:59.371
leaflets when these boys
made their bones.

59:59.373 --> 01:00:01.239
It's from last Easter.

01:00:01.241 --> 01:00:04.709
Supposed to disappear
after the boot party.

01:00:05.812 --> 01:00:07.579
He just started talking.

01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:09.347
Amber's alive
saying Werm did it.

01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:10.448
Never mind that.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.417
You...

01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:18.456
Werm saved us all.

01:00:25.866 --> 01:00:27.566
Sam?

01:00:30.437 --> 01:00:32.470
It's okay.

01:00:32.472 --> 01:00:36.141
I mean,
it's not okay.

01:00:36.143 --> 01:00:38.643
- You didn't know either?
- He's with us.

01:00:38.645 --> 01:00:39.744
Not where.

01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:41.386
We gotta split.

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:48.653
This has a wider duct, I think.

01:00:48.655 --> 01:00:51.590
We're not gonna
fit through there.

01:00:51.592 --> 01:00:53.291
Oh!

01:00:53.293 --> 01:00:55.794
Daniel, um, he can help.

01:00:55.796 --> 01:00:57.195
Why?

01:00:57.197 --> 01:00:58.797
Who's he?

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:01.700
A traitor. If they don't
already know, they know now.

01:01:01.702 --> 01:01:03.401
I can get us out of here.

01:01:03.403 --> 01:01:05.337
Wow. A conspiracy.

01:01:05.339 --> 01:01:07.339
No, just a cluster-fuck.

01:01:14.281 --> 01:01:17.349
There is still blades
and fangs for the visitors,

01:01:17.351 --> 01:01:19.451
but we are getting
lean on time.

01:01:19.453 --> 01:01:22.520
Now, if you have
to shoot, shoot once.

01:01:22.522 --> 01:01:24.756
If more than once,
keep it a tight grouping

01:01:24.758 --> 01:01:27.192
'cause you'll be digging
the slugs out yourself.

01:01:27.194 --> 01:01:29.154
As for Daniel and Amber,
they can...

01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:36.034
What did we forget?

01:01:45.812 --> 01:01:48.780
There's a river on two sides.
The quarry's on another.

01:01:48.782 --> 01:01:51.916
We can parallel the main road back,
go for help.

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:53.918
Well, how do we get
past the door?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.654
I know something you don't.

01:01:55.656 --> 01:01:57.455
Good. What?

01:01:57.457 --> 01:01:59.291
I know where we keep...

01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:02.427
Too slow.

01:02:36.963 --> 01:02:38.930
Should we go?

01:02:38.932 --> 01:02:40.432
Now?

01:02:40.434 --> 01:02:41.900
We have the gun.

01:02:41.902 --> 01:02:43.768
I guess.

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.303
Yes.

01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:46.671
Yes!

01:02:46.673 --> 01:02:48.773
Give me two.

01:03:11.298 --> 01:03:13.298
Easy! Not her!

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.899
Don't fire!

01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:16.000
<i>Fass! Fass!</i>

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:17.035
<i>Fass!</i>

01:03:18.605 --> 01:03:19.738
Go!

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.872
Sam!

01:03:21.975 --> 01:03:23.041
Sam!

01:03:32.519 --> 01:03:34.753
We're never getting out.

01:03:40.093 --> 01:03:41.593
Fuck.

01:04:03.683 --> 01:04:05.950
You know, I'm lucky.

01:04:05.952 --> 01:04:09.120
I guessed at least
they were gonna shoot me.

01:04:20.133 --> 01:04:21.833
Three'll do, gentlemen.

01:04:21.835 --> 01:04:23.401
The fourth can disappear.

01:04:23.403 --> 01:04:24.836
It's time to start
the clean-up.

01:04:24.838 --> 01:04:27.405
I'm gonna need
a push broom.

01:04:27.407 --> 01:04:30.375
This is supposed to
have happened already.

01:04:30.377 --> 01:04:32.217
- Time to sprint.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:33.513 --> 01:04:35.113
Well done.

01:04:36.149 --> 01:04:37.215
Thank him.

01:04:39.519 --> 01:04:43.154
Nearly got away
from me. Us.

01:04:48.795 --> 01:04:51.129
Shouldn't we be panicking?

01:04:55.402 --> 01:04:57.101
I'm hungry.

01:05:04.611 --> 01:05:07.712
I can't die here with you.

01:05:09.449 --> 01:05:11.115
So don't.

01:05:13.186 --> 01:05:16.721
You know, feel free just to...

01:05:20.927 --> 01:05:23.628
Hey, I want the rest
of your pep talk.

01:05:25.131 --> 01:05:27.866
Oh, no.
It no longer applies.

01:05:27.868 --> 01:05:30.134
Oh, come on.

01:05:30.136 --> 01:05:32.237
I'm curious.

01:05:33.673 --> 01:05:36.708
It was paintballing...

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:39.043
you were cowering...

01:05:41.915 --> 01:05:44.048
Yeah, Rick Silva.

01:05:45.986 --> 01:05:51.689
We were getting slaughtered
by these legit Iraq vets.

01:05:51.691 --> 01:05:53.558
It totally applies.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.863
Full camo, thousand-dollar
automatic paintball guns.

01:06:00.467 --> 01:06:05.737
They knew real war
and they played real war.

01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:10.975
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.

01:06:10.977 --> 01:06:15.013
Just wiped us all out.

01:06:17.751 --> 01:06:22.153
So Rick gets fed up
and says, "Fuck it."

01:06:22.155 --> 01:06:25.690
Didn't care
about getting shot.

01:06:25.692 --> 01:06:28.760
Didn't care about taking cover.

01:06:29.996 --> 01:06:31.796
It was hopeless, man.

01:06:34.267 --> 01:06:39.837
So the last match,
the whistle blows,

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:44.008
and he just
tears out there,

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:50.748
full jackass, in...
in sneakers and cut-offs

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:55.119
and he... wipes out
their whole team.

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:59.524
Doesn't stop.

01:06:59.526 --> 01:07:05.897
Just keeps running
and laughing and shooting...

01:07:08.001 --> 01:07:10.668
until they're all dead.

01:07:14.207 --> 01:07:16.140
Pretend dead.

01:07:17.577 --> 01:07:20.745
And we're up
against real guns.

01:07:20.747 --> 01:07:22.180
Yeah.

01:07:24.651 --> 01:07:29.120
Either way,
we can't play real war.

01:07:55.281 --> 01:07:57.215
Let's pretend.

01:08:14.267 --> 01:08:15.400
For you.

01:08:17.303 --> 01:08:19.737
We're just mopping up tonight.

01:08:19.738 --> 01:08:21.673
You already earned these.

01:08:25.278 --> 01:08:28.279
Maybe push Neal,
depending on the mess,

01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:30.180
to start looking
for a new house band.

01:08:30.183 --> 01:08:32.950
We've really gotta get
back to a routine.

01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:34.919
You think Cowcatcher's
gonna talk?

01:08:34.921 --> 01:08:37.788
I'm more worried
about their habits.

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:41.359
Really have to stay away
from that nigger dope.

01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:44.362
There's a bad batch
doing the rounds.

01:08:53.707 --> 01:08:55.173
We're good to go.

01:08:58.278 --> 01:09:00.879
We're set.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.840
This all hinges on nothing
having happened here.

01:09:06.019 --> 01:09:07.059
Now, let's be clear.

01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:12.423
This should keep him alive
for another hour.

01:09:12.425 --> 01:09:14.692
I would consider it
a personal favor

01:09:14.694 --> 01:09:16.613
if he dies with meat
in his teeth.

01:09:18.965 --> 01:09:21.198
Come on. Come on.

01:09:24.304 --> 01:09:25.970
Bite command is <i>"fass."</i>

01:09:27.407 --> 01:09:29.040
It's all you'll need.

01:09:36.249 --> 01:09:39.716
Disregard. Just shoot
who is left.

01:09:39.719 --> 01:09:41.452
They don't have to
be accounted for.

01:09:41.453 --> 01:09:44.087
Forensics is
no longer a concern.

01:09:45.959 --> 01:09:49.127
We call this in late,
all is for naught.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.700
You guys got
any 12 gauge?

01:09:55.702 --> 01:09:57.769
Not in the office.
Try the bar.

01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:59.904
- How many shots you have left?
- Three.

01:09:59.906 --> 01:10:01.105
So you have one extra.

01:10:15.421 --> 01:10:16.988
No shells.

01:10:20.426 --> 01:10:23.187
Behind the bar.
Better get started.

01:10:36.276 --> 01:10:37.809
Shit!

01:10:39.112 --> 01:10:40.792
Easy! Easy!

01:10:43.082 --> 01:10:44.282
Easy!

01:10:44.284 --> 01:10:46.084
No buckshot!

01:11:07.373 --> 01:11:08.773
What's happening?

01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:10.808
Dog freaked.
And turn this shit off!

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:12.510
I tried! It's not coming
from our mixer.

01:11:12.512 --> 01:11:14.145
Go! We got this.

01:11:14.147 --> 01:11:16.914
And don't tell Darcy.
Or Clark.

01:11:20.787 --> 01:11:22.347
We going?
Yeah.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:26.240
Hey!

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:28.291
Down there, you dip-shit fashion
punk clown motherfuckers!

01:11:28.294 --> 01:11:29.861
- Turn around!
<i>- Shazbot!</i>

01:11:29.863 --> 01:11:31.896
What? What...
Who is that?

01:11:31.898 --> 01:11:33.898
Odin himself.

01:12:01.194 --> 01:12:02.560
Give me the shotgun.

01:12:02.562 --> 01:12:04.061
No, I got the shotgun.

01:12:04.063 --> 01:12:06.497
Then you go down
this fucking hole.

01:12:09.068 --> 01:12:10.167
Three shots?

01:12:10.169 --> 01:12:12.153
Yeah.

01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:14.138
You hear me fire twice,
you come down no matter what.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.140
- This is a trap.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:12:16.142 --> 01:12:17.408
You wanna go tell Darcy?

01:12:22.882 --> 01:12:24.582
He's gonna be pissed.

01:12:28.354 --> 01:12:30.221
Watch my back.

01:12:55.281 --> 01:12:57.014
Fuck this.

01:12:59.185 --> 01:13:00.618
Get Gabe, man!

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.386
We need two down here
and one up there.

01:13:02.388 --> 01:13:05.122
Who's got the nine?
I think Alan does, but I'm not sure-

01:13:05.124 --> 01:13:07.625
Oh, fuck! Block it!

01:13:09.329 --> 01:13:10.809
Pat!

01:13:11.998 --> 01:13:13.464
He's got three shots left!

01:13:13.466 --> 01:13:14.999
Bitch.

01:13:25.378 --> 01:13:27.078
Gabe!

01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:36.287
Amber!

01:13:36.289 --> 01:13:37.555
Yeah?

01:13:37.557 --> 01:13:39.357
Uh...

01:13:40.593 --> 01:13:42.026
never mind!

01:13:50.403 --> 01:13:52.136
Two shots left!

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.114
Nice fuckin' try!

01:14:05.418 --> 01:14:07.118
Go fuck yourself!

01:14:13.326 --> 01:14:15.526
Shit. Shit.

01:14:40.119 --> 01:14:41.352
Oh, shit!

01:14:43.723 --> 01:14:44.755
Pat!

01:14:44.757 --> 01:14:46.557
One shot left!

01:14:52.565 --> 01:14:54.131
Fuck.

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.307
Zero.

01:15:10.483 --> 01:15:11.483
Oh, shit!

01:15:17.457 --> 01:15:18.823
Get off of me!

01:15:56.095 --> 01:15:57.428
Got him.

01:15:59.432 --> 01:16:00.831
Totally.

01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:05.736
Flabbergasted that motherfucker.

01:16:26.325 --> 01:16:28.259
If I had any idea...

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:34.806
Anymore dogs?

01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:38.802
People?

01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:40.437
No. Not here.

01:16:40.439 --> 01:16:43.641
They're... up the road.

01:16:56.856 --> 01:16:58.589
I don't want to go to jail.

01:17:36.862 --> 01:17:39.930
Does anyone know
how to hotwire a car?

01:17:39.932 --> 01:17:41.298
No.

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.634
I'd stay off
the road anyway.

01:18:00.786 --> 01:18:02.453
Are you gonna shoot me?

01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:05.422
Where's Werm?

01:18:06.559 --> 01:18:09.493
- We sent him home...
- Stay quiet till we're out.

01:18:33.452 --> 01:18:35.492
It's the residents.

01:18:36.856 --> 01:18:38.289
What are they doing?

01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:40.691
Something you don't
want to see.

01:18:42.862 --> 01:18:45.663
We can call the cops
when we get to the orchard.

01:18:50.336 --> 01:18:52.436
Did you see them die?

01:18:53.906 --> 01:18:55.939
Two.

01:18:55.941 --> 01:18:57.574
Not the third.

01:19:01.614 --> 01:19:03.781
I think I'm going.

01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:07.651
You can call the cops
when you get there.

01:19:07.653 --> 01:19:10.521
If you disappear,
I'll find you.

01:19:10.523 --> 01:19:11.789
I will.

01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:17.961
I promise.

01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:21.932
You should go, too.

01:19:23.369 --> 01:19:25.102
Just hedge our bets.

01:19:26.605 --> 01:19:29.473
You got three rounds...

01:19:29.475 --> 01:19:32.376
and I've seen
you pump a shotgun.

01:19:32.378 --> 01:19:34.578
Fair enough.

01:19:49.929 --> 01:19:51.528
Do you believe him?

01:19:52.965 --> 01:19:55.065
Shh.

01:20:07.513 --> 01:20:08.946
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

01:20:12.051 --> 01:20:13.083
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:21.024
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

01:20:21.026 --> 01:20:22.993
<i>Nimm futter!
Nimm futter!</i>

01:20:24.029 --> 01:20:25.829
- Jesus.
<i>- Nimm futter!</i>

01:20:27.366 --> 01:20:29.466
That ought to be enough.

01:20:29.468 --> 01:20:31.502
<i>Lass es! Lass es!</i>

01:20:31.504 --> 01:20:32.736
<i>Lass es!</i>

01:20:32.738 --> 01:20:34.905
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

01:20:34.907 --> 01:20:36.173
<i>Aus. Aus.</i>

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:42.579
Wipe it down!

01:20:45.851 --> 01:20:47.718
Do you think they'd
leave the engine on?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.788
Yeah. It'll run
the gauge down too.

01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:52.990
Let's call this in.

01:20:55.494 --> 01:20:57.027
<i>Aus. Aus.</i>

01:20:57.029 --> 01:20:58.429
You got the dog?

01:20:59.899 --> 01:21:00.899
I got the dog.

01:21:04.937 --> 01:21:06.503
Tie him up.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.107
Give me your gun.

01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:11.875
I don't have one.

01:21:11.877 --> 01:21:14.678
I'll shoot you either way
if you don't hand me one.

01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:23.220
Throw it.

01:22:40.232 --> 01:22:41.965
They're making it our fault.

01:22:44.236 --> 01:22:46.904
You were trespassing.

01:22:53.779 --> 01:22:56.013
It looks fishy to me.

01:22:56.015 --> 01:22:58.582
The cloth is
to make it seal.

01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:00.284
I wouldn't do it like that.

01:23:01.687 --> 01:23:02.719
They got my gun.

01:23:02.721 --> 01:23:04.481
- Shut up.
- Listen...

01:23:19.505 --> 01:23:21.805
So we're doing that?

01:23:21.807 --> 01:23:24.141
Why else would
we walk up here?

01:23:26.645 --> 01:23:29.245
I don't know.
And I was gonna...

01:23:30.616 --> 01:23:32.583
ruin the crime scene.

01:23:33.986 --> 01:23:35.018
Oh.

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:37.854
I thought we'd leave a new one.

01:23:53.305 --> 01:23:55.038
This...

01:23:56.642 --> 01:23:58.308
is a nightmare.

01:24:00.079 --> 01:24:01.345
For us all.

01:24:02.815 --> 01:24:07.150
Tell me those stupid fucking
words are his last.

01:24:15.661 --> 01:24:17.227
Do you have a phone?

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.100
It's funny.

01:24:24.803 --> 01:24:27.070
You were so scary at night.

01:25:34.306 --> 01:25:36.940
We need the police.

01:25:57.763 --> 01:25:59.830
<i>Okay, I'm the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.</i>

01:25:59.832 --> 01:26:01.698
<i>Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.</i>

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:05.068
<i>Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.</i>

01:26:11.076 --> 01:26:12.442
<i>Yeah, if we can afford it.</i>

01:26:12.444 --> 01:26:14.911
<i>Yeah, no, I really dig
the analogue style.</i>

01:26:14.913 --> 01:26:17.414
<i>Uh, which brings me to the fact
that you guys are hard to find.</i>

01:27:09.835 --> 01:27:11.368
I know what it is.

01:27:15.507 --> 01:27:17.407
What what is?

01:27:22.514 --> 01:27:25.148
My desert island band.

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:33.356
