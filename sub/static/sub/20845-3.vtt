WEBVTT

00:00.187 --> 00:03.122
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.319 --> 00:05.156
You know, being back
here at my mom's house

00:05.157 --> 00:07.258
brings back a lot of memories.

00:07.259 --> 00:10.428
Most of 'em bad.

00:10.429 --> 00:12.096
But good ones, too.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.265
Like here, I called
this my happy chair.

00:14.266 --> 00:16.100
This the one place in the house

00:16.101 --> 00:17.468
my dad never beat me.

00:19.171 --> 00:22.139
Mm, it is comfy.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.208
You know, I can see why Mom

00:24.209 --> 00:26.343
never wants to come down
to South Carolina with us.

00:26.345 --> 00:28.412
You know there's not a single
picture of her in this house.

00:28.413 --> 00:29.847
Well, I'm sure there's
a picture of your mama

00:29.848 --> 00:31.282
up in here somewhere.

00:31.283 --> 00:32.415
Dad, Grandma has a picture

00:32.417 --> 00:36.287
of you alone on your wedding day.

00:36.288 --> 00:40.424
Well, see, that's because
your mama and your grandmother

00:40.425 --> 00:42.793
always had a very tense relationship.

00:42.794 --> 00:44.462
Yeah, Daddy, why they never got along?

00:44.463 --> 00:47.131
Well, your grandmother always wanted me

00:47.132 --> 00:50.134
to marry a lighter skinned woman.

00:50.135 --> 00:52.136
She tried to like your mama,
but she always thought

00:52.137 --> 00:53.571
she was just a little too dark.

00:54.539 --> 00:56.440
Dad, that's crazy.
I'm sure Grandma doesn't care

00:56.441 --> 00:57.642
what color skin Mom has.

00:57.643 --> 00:58.809
Yes, she does.

00:59.811 --> 01:02.113
See, your grandma came through
a very turbulent time

01:02.114 --> 01:06.150
in history and to her,
lighter skin meant less pain,

01:06.151 --> 01:07.251
less suffering.

01:08.086 --> 01:09.487
She always thought if
I could marry lighter,

01:09.488 --> 01:11.322
that you boys would have a easier time

01:11.323 --> 01:13.290
to make it in the world.

01:13.291 --> 01:18.262
You see, kids, sometimes racism
stems from a place of love.

01:22.668 --> 01:24.835
You know something, Daddy,
I've always said this to myself:

01:24.836 --> 01:27.705
I was just three shades away
from greatness.

01:30.175 --> 01:31.842
There she is.

01:31.843 --> 01:33.811
Aw, look at my boys.

01:33.812 --> 01:36.714
It's like three Snicker
bars came to life.

01:39.484 --> 01:41.519
Was that a comment
about our complexion?

01:41.520 --> 01:42.720
Absolutely.

01:43.588 --> 01:45.656
Okay, gather around.

01:45.657 --> 01:48.359
I got some important news
I need to share with you.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.294
Joe, you might want
to sit down for this.

01:50.295 --> 01:51.862
Mom, what is it? Is everything okay?

01:51.863 --> 01:53.497
Honey, sit down.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.868
Okay, there's no easy way to say this,

01:57.869 --> 01:59.603
so I'm just gonna come
out and tell you.

01:59.604 --> 02:02.606
I've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

02:02.607 --> 02:05.342
Wait. That's your news?

02:05.343 --> 02:07.678
Well, I'm sorry to have to
break it to you this way.

02:07.679 --> 02:11.248
Uh, Mom, we've known
about this for six months.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:21.226 --> 02:23.294
Wait, you mean I told you this already?

02:23.295 --> 02:24.528
Yes.

02:24.529 --> 02:26.035
For real?

02:29.234 --> 02:31.769
This news is even sadder
the second time around.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.907
Grandma, how have you been feeling?

02:36.908 --> 02:38.976
Well, it's been a struggle,

02:38.977 --> 02:40.978
but I'm feeling better
now that I've decided

02:40.979 --> 02:43.247
to take matters into my own hands

02:43.248 --> 02:46.283
and end my life myself.

02:47.853 --> 02:49.386
- Mom.
- Oh, I'm sorry,

02:49.387 --> 02:51.522
have I... did I tell you
that news already, too?

02:53.525 --> 02:57.428
No, you didn't tell us that news.

02:57.429 --> 02:59.763
Good, then that's the news
I wanted to tell you.

03:01.566 --> 03:03.801

03:17.458 --> 03:21.645
Mom, saying you're gonna
end your own life is crazy.

03:21.646 --> 03:23.035
Maybe you're having a bad day.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.938
I-I-I know Alzheimer's is-is hard,

03:25.939 --> 03:28.132
but-but have you been
getting out the house enough?

03:28.133 --> 03:30.243
I mean, have you been
seeing your friends?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.778
Maybe we need to spruce this
place up, get you some plants

03:32.779 --> 03:34.280
or-or a dog.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.884
Dad, I don't... I don't think a dog's

03:37.885 --> 03:40.219
a great idea,
considering her condition.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.388
You know, you got to...

03:42.389 --> 03:44.757
take it out, feed it,

03:44.758 --> 03:47.159
remember that you have it.

03:48.829 --> 03:53.699
Joe, I'm confused all the time
and I'm scared,

03:53.700 --> 03:55.601
scared of what's coming.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.703
I'm losing who I am.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.805
But, Ma, you used to be so active.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.274
You had all those hobbies.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.675
Oh, I didn't like that stuff,

04:02.676 --> 04:03.843
I just wanted to get out the house

04:03.844 --> 04:05.444
to keep your father from beating me.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.612
Trust me,

04:07.614 --> 04:11.417
every woman in a pottery class
is crying out for help.

04:13.253 --> 04:18.357
Mom, maybe you could move up
to North Carolina with us.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.526
We'll take care of you,
make you feel comfortable,

04:20.527 --> 04:23.396
cook for you, help you get
to your-your appointments.

04:23.397 --> 04:27.266
Joe, I got to make this
decision while I still can.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.636
The other day, I was staring at a
photo of me hugging some woman

04:30.637 --> 04:32.438
I didn't even recognize.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.308
I had to read the inscription
on the back to find out that

04:35.309 --> 04:39.545
that woman was my best
friend for 40 years.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.116
Grandma, that's the
saddest thing I ever heard.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.519
Oh, don't feel sad for me.
I had a good life.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.088
Especially growing up
a poor black woman

04:49.089 --> 04:51.123
who lived through Jim Crow.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.659
I mean, just not being
raped or killed by the Klan,

04:53.660 --> 04:56.996
I'd say I did all right for myself.

04:57.965 --> 05:02.068
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.303
But I need you, Grandma.
And I love you.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.939
Look, you always been there for me.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.375
You know, and you give me
money at all my birthdays.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.746
I know this is kind
of embarrassing to admit,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.881
but... you don't know how many times

05:15.882 --> 05:18.217
that $15 saved my ass.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.622
Mom, I'm calling your doctor
first thing in the morning

05:23.623 --> 05:25.006
and I'm getting him to up your meds.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.760
All that medication does
is make me more confused

05:27.761 --> 05:29.929
- and sick to my stomach.
- But, Ma,

05:29.930 --> 05:32.531
you can still live another
five or ten years with this.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.166
I'm making a choice, Joe:

05:34.167 --> 05:38.604
to go out the way I
want to, with dignity.

05:38.605 --> 05:42.708
Now, I've saved enough pain
medication to get the job done.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.845
And I have everything I
need to do this tonight.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.613
Tonight?

05:47.614 --> 05:49.015
Tonight?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.284
And you're just telling us this?

05:52.285 --> 05:54.420
Well, I didn't want you to
have to carry it around

05:54.421 --> 05:55.955
and I didn't want to worry you.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.724
And I thought I had
told you this last week.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.594
No, no, no.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.662
This isn't happening at all,
let alone tonight.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.432
Mom, you go to get this
nonsense out of your head.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.534
Joe, I know it's hard, honey,

06:08.535 --> 06:10.036
and I know it's a lot,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.204
but I'm serious about ending my life

06:12.205 --> 06:14.073
and I need your blessing.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.341
Uh-oh.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.643
Snickerdoodles are ready.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.619
Man...

06:26.620 --> 06:28.354
if I'd have known Grandma
was gonna kill herself,

06:28.355 --> 06:30.990
I would have wore a different outfit.

06:34.361 --> 06:37.797
We got to get these
thoughts out of her head.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.532
I don't know, Dad.

06:39.533 --> 06:43.069
I mean, I don't want Grandma to
go through with this either,

06:43.070 --> 06:46.172
but think about it like this:
Grandma wants to go out on top.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.008
I mean, wouldn't you have rather
seen Michael Jordan retire

06:49.009 --> 06:51.944
after hitting that three-pointer
against the Jazz in '98

06:51.945 --> 06:54.013
instead of seeing this
dude way past his prime

06:54.014 --> 06:56.081
in a Wizards jersey?

06:58.819 --> 07:02.988
Don't make Grandma
play for the Wizards.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.759
Why did we let Mike do that to himself?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.762
- Was our greed too much?
- Huh?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.565
Did our eyes get bigger
and more lustful

07:12.566 --> 07:15.468
than our stomachs can handle?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.635
Did we?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.637
Answer me, please.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.543
I mean, maybe she's making
the right decision.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.712
Look, she is an adult,
and we're gonna have to

07:26.713 --> 07:28.647
just respect her
judgment on this, right?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.516
Are you crazy?

07:30.517 --> 07:31.884
This woman is suffering

07:31.885 --> 07:33.486
from a brain disease.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.854
She is the last person on Earth

07:34.855 --> 07:38.390
whose judgment we
need to start trusting.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.126
I don't even trust her
to use the oven right now.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.363
I mean,

07:44.364 --> 07:46.432
yeah, I'm not eating those cookies.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.270
Look, she couldn't even
remember her best friend

07:51.271 --> 07:52.833
she'd known for years.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.373
So you mean to tell me she
gonna know the difference

07:54.374 --> 07:56.942
between suicide pills and brown sugar?

07:56.943 --> 07:59.345
Come on, y'all.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.180
I don't know, I just
don't think it's right

08:01.181 --> 08:03.082
to say that she's out of her mind.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.117
She seems to know exactly
what she wants to do.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.785
Well, this is easy for you to accept

08:06.786 --> 08:08.754
because you only see an old lady.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.456
But that's my mother.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.915
Now, how would you feel if this
was happening to your mother?

08:12.916 --> 08:15.828
Nah, we couldn't let her do that.

08:17.731 --> 08:21.634
But, Dad...

08:21.635 --> 08:25.070
if you ever wanted to kill yourself,

08:25.071 --> 08:27.806
I would respect your decision.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.181
We're talking about suicide.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.881
You do realize how wrong that is

08:36.883 --> 08:38.717
morally, legally...

08:38.717 --> 08:40.885
it even says so in the Bible.

08:40.886 --> 08:43.389
Daddy, that's not a fact.
I mean, you know,

08:43.390 --> 08:45.658
the Bible got a lot of
hidden loopholes, you know?

08:47.260 --> 08:48.827
You know, you just got
to skim through it,

08:48.828 --> 08:50.529
and you got to accept
it like one of those

08:50.530 --> 08:52.631
Apple user agreements.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.333
I am sure glad your mama's not here

08:58.334 --> 08:59.238
to see any of this.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.940
It doesn't matter
if it's biblically wrong

09:00.941 --> 09:02.641
or legally wrong, what matters is

09:02.642 --> 09:04.843
what's best for Grandma,
let's not forget that.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.412
So you're really gonna
be able to sleep at night

09:06.413 --> 09:09.114
knowing you stood by and
watched someone that you love

09:09.115 --> 09:10.282
take their own life?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.583
Well, what's the other option?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.519
Forcing her to live a
life against her will?

09:13.520 --> 09:16.322
You're damn straight!
I've been doing that for years!

09:18.425 --> 09:20.693
Dad, I get it.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.161
I know this is hard.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.462
I know it's really, really tough,

09:23.463 --> 09:25.130
but a lot of families
have to go through

09:25.131 --> 09:27.166
making a decision to pull the plug.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.868
Yeah, but this is not
no pull-the-plug situation.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.971
This is pulling the plug out the wall

09:31.972 --> 09:34.973
and strangling her with the cord.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.509
Okay, here they are, your favorites,

09:37.510 --> 09:40.079
my snickerdoodle cookies.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.215
Okay, let's start talking game plan

09:43.216 --> 09:44.883
for how we gonna kill me.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.685
Wait...

09:53.526 --> 09:56.695
There is no game plan
because this isn't happening.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.697
I'm in this all by myself?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.532
No, Grandma, you're not. I'm with you.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.800
Yeah, me, too.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.141
I don't want to see you suffer.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.637
Has this whole family
lost its damn mind?

10:05.639 --> 10:10.476
Well, Jerrod, I guess you gonna
have to be my pillow man.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.678
What's a pillow man?

10:12.679 --> 10:15.848
Well, in case the pills
only do half the job,

10:15.849 --> 10:19.385
I need somebody I trust
standing over me with a pillow,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.854
ready to finish the deed.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.792
That can't be a real thing, can it?

10:27.594 --> 10:29.662
Well, Grandma,

10:29.663 --> 10:32.231
you got a pillow preference? Um...

10:36.169 --> 10:38.771
Do you want to do Bless This House

10:38.772 --> 10:41.507
or Faith Love Hope? Which one?

10:41.508 --> 10:43.208
Let's let the pillow man decide.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.476
I'm not deciding which uplifting pillow

10:44.477 --> 10:47.146
to kill my grandmother with.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.381
But if you had to choose?

10:51.584 --> 10:53.118
Faith Love Hope.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.254
My man.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.022
I can't believe I'm
saying this, Jerrod,

10:57.023 --> 10:59.391
but I'm not gonna stand here
and let you kill my mama.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.361
I know it's one of these. Ha!

11:02.362 --> 11:03.996
I got the pills!

11:03.997 --> 11:05.931
Ain't nobody dying on my watch.

11:05.932 --> 11:10.803
What you think about that, you
two little black-ass Kevorkians?

11:19.664 --> 11:20.739
Dad.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.735
You got some nerve coming up in here

11:22.736 --> 11:25.816
after you threatening to
kill my mama. Murderer!

11:27.914 --> 11:29.787
Dad, stop yelling.

11:29.788 --> 11:31.593
You're embarrassing us in
front of people at Wendy's,

11:31.594 --> 11:33.252
which is really hard to do.

11:33.253 --> 11:34.854
Why did you follow me?

11:34.855 --> 11:36.488
I wanted to see if you were okay.

11:36.489 --> 11:38.791
I guess I got so caught
up in how Grandma felt

11:38.792 --> 11:40.993
I forgot to see how you felt.

11:40.994 --> 11:43.062
You know, when I was a kid,

11:43.063 --> 11:45.598
my daddy used to come home drunk,

11:45.599 --> 11:47.099
ready to beat the hell out of me,

11:47.100 --> 11:49.068
and my mama would do whatever it took

11:49.069 --> 11:50.836
to keep that from happening.

11:51.905 --> 11:53.639
She saved my life.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.474
My daddy was a big man.

11:55.475 --> 11:59.311
But she'd put herself between
us and took that beating.

11:59.312 --> 12:03.682
She rescued me when I was
at my most vulnerable.

12:03.683 --> 12:05.651
And now that she's at
her most vulnerable,

12:05.652 --> 12:08.053
all I want to do...

12:08.054 --> 12:10.656
is save her, but she won't let me.

12:11.524 --> 12:14.393
Dad, this...

12:14.394 --> 12:18.264
this isn't a problem that
you can save her from.

12:18.265 --> 12:21.267
Yes, I can, long as I got these pills.

12:21.268 --> 12:24.303
Look, it doesn't matter
that you have the pills.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.105
She's determined to do this, you know.

12:26.106 --> 12:27.306
Sh-She'll just find another way.

12:27.307 --> 12:28.707
She'll jump off a bridge

12:28.708 --> 12:31.143
or walk in front of a
truck or sit in a car...

12:31.144 --> 12:34.079
I got it. Okay.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.082
You were right about something, okay?

12:37.083 --> 12:38.951
I am a little removed.

12:38.952 --> 12:42.087
It is harder to lose a mother
than it is a grandmother.

12:42.088 --> 12:45.257
But maybe, maybe that's
what you need right now, Dad...

12:45.258 --> 12:47.259
someone who can be a little objective.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.662
All right? And what I see is a woman

12:49.663 --> 12:52.865
who is determined to do
this with or without you.

12:54.701 --> 12:56.902
I don't know if I can walk around

12:56.903 --> 13:00.005
knowing I let my mama die like that.

13:01.641 --> 13:03.008
But, Dad,

13:03.009 --> 13:05.611
the only other option
that you have is knowing

13:05.612 --> 13:07.746
that you're walking around without...

13:07.747 --> 13:10.883
ever having the chance to say good-bye.

13:12.285 --> 13:15.654
Man, that's some heavy
stuff right there.

13:21.761 --> 13:24.069
Took you long enough.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.497
Look, do you know how
hard it is to entertain

13:25.498 --> 13:27.466
a suicidal grandmother?

13:27.467 --> 13:29.335
Especially on an empty stomach.

13:29.336 --> 13:31.203
I'm sorry, Bobby. Next
time I'll try and get Dad

13:31.204 --> 13:33.405
to accept his mom's death faster.

13:33.406 --> 13:35.274
See that you do.

13:39.612 --> 13:42.715
Hey. I knew you'd come back.

13:42.716 --> 13:45.017
Sorry I left.

13:45.018 --> 13:47.986
But I was just trying to protect you

13:47.988 --> 13:50.089
the way you always protected me.

13:50.924 --> 13:53.525
You are protecting me,

13:53.526 --> 13:54.960
by letting me do this

13:54.961 --> 13:57.863
and being here to hold my hand.

13:57.864 --> 13:59.732
Well, I don't know if
I'm as strong as you are,

13:59.733 --> 14:00.866
but I'll do my best.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.401
I love you, baby.

14:02.402 --> 14:04.970
And I'm so proud of the
man you've become.

14:04.971 --> 14:07.339
Look how you raised your boys.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.676
You're a so much better
father than the one you had.

14:10.677 --> 14:12.144
Thank you, Mom.

14:13.413 --> 14:16.648
Of course now, the bar
wasn't raised that high.

14:18.518 --> 14:23.389
All you had to do was not
beat your entire family.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.791
So good job, son.

14:32.232 --> 14:35.601
Now, baby, you don't have
to be here while I take these.

14:35.602 --> 14:37.669
No, I want to be here.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.932
All right, boys, come on in.

15:08.401 --> 15:10.836
Hey, Grandma. How are you feeling?

15:10.837 --> 15:12.037
Anything we can get you?

15:12.038 --> 15:14.173
I'm okay, sweetheart.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.075
Man.

15:16.076 --> 15:20.045
This could very well be our
last moments with our grandma.

15:20.046 --> 15:23.682
Bobby, these are definitely our
last moments with our grandma.

15:25.919 --> 15:28.687
Look, Grandma, there's something
that I've been meaning

15:28.688 --> 15:32.191
to get off my chest for,
like, 20 years, and I just...

15:32.192 --> 15:34.893
I guess I'll just tell you now.

15:34.894 --> 15:38.130
When I was eight, I stole
ten dollars from your purse

15:38.131 --> 15:40.099
to go to the ice cream truck.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.700
I'm so sorry, Grandma.

15:41.701 --> 15:43.535
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.

15:43.536 --> 15:48.273
All you got to do is
give me my money back...

15:52.445 --> 15:54.546
...and we'll be even-steven.

15:59.119 --> 16:01.019
Oh.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.355
Oh, oh, you're serious.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.162
I mean, all I got is this 20.

16:10.163 --> 16:12.497
Inflation.

16:14.134 --> 16:16.969
Man, you'll get that back in a minute.

16:22.342 --> 16:25.010
Grandma, there's... I don't know,

16:25.011 --> 16:27.179
there's so much I want
to say to you right now,

16:27.180 --> 16:29.815
I don't know where to begin,
I mean, last words are tough.

16:29.816 --> 16:33.018
I really want to make sure I
say the right thing to you.

16:33.019 --> 16:35.587
Now, baby, don't put too much on this.

16:35.588 --> 16:38.724
We've had a lot of great
times over the years.

16:38.725 --> 16:40.759
And there's nothing we need to say now

16:40.760 --> 16:42.961
that we haven't said already.

16:42.962 --> 16:45.197
We just want to make
this special for you.

16:45.198 --> 16:46.765
Okay, I'll tell you what.

16:46.766 --> 16:48.534
I didn't eat dinner,

16:48.535 --> 16:50.836
and that Wendy's is
smelling pretty good.

16:50.837 --> 16:52.771
So why don't you hand me a burger,

16:52.772 --> 16:56.508
and we'll just let that be our
last great moment together?

16:56.509 --> 16:59.711
Of course, Grandma, anything you want.

16:59.712 --> 17:01.213
Oh, shoot.

17:01.214 --> 17:03.382
It got cheese on it.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.551
That's okay.

17:06.553 --> 17:09.186
You know, Mom, we could
always take the cheese off.

17:09.189 --> 17:11.190
No, baby, you can still
taste the cheese.

17:11.191 --> 17:13.392
Cheese is overpowering.

17:13.393 --> 17:15.093
Eh, that's okay.

17:15.094 --> 17:18.030
I'll just die hungry.

17:19.232 --> 17:21.400
Look at my boys.

17:21.401 --> 17:22.667
I love you,

17:22.669 --> 17:26.104
little licorice sticks.

17:30.109 --> 17:34.012
I mean, these candies just keep
getting darker and darker.

17:36.382 --> 17:38.383
- We love you, Mom.
- Yeah.

17:38.384 --> 17:40.986
I love you very much.

17:43.056 --> 17:46.325
We love you, Grandma.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.995
Yeah, I love you, Grandma.

17:55.835 --> 17:57.903
Is she gone?

17:57.904 --> 18:00.872
Yeah, I think so.

18:00.873 --> 18:02.507
No, I'm still here.

18:02.508 --> 18:04.609
Oh.

18:12.585 --> 18:15.320
I thought I was going out,
but I guess not.

18:15.321 --> 18:18.624
Well, well, can we get you anything?

18:18.625 --> 18:20.392
Do me a favor.

18:20.393 --> 18:24.463
Put on American Ninja Warrior.

18:24.464 --> 18:28.734
I want to watch that as
the angels whisk me away.

18:28.735 --> 18:31.036
I don't think that should
be your last show.

18:31.037 --> 18:32.437
Y-You know, it should be
something more epic,

18:32.438 --> 18:35.307
like, uh, Empire.

18:35.308 --> 18:37.342
Have you watched Empire before?

18:37.343 --> 18:38.944
No, I haven't seen it.

18:38.945 --> 18:41.313
But I've been meaning
to check that out.

18:41.314 --> 18:44.750
Put on the first episode.

18:44.751 --> 18:46.118
Grandma...

18:46.119 --> 18:48.120
I don't think this is the time

18:48.121 --> 18:51.823
for you to be starting a new series.

18:54.827 --> 18:58.864
I mean, they're in their third season,

18:58.865 --> 19:00.866
and you're, you know...

19:00.867 --> 19:03.535
killing yourself.

19:05.038 --> 19:06.505
Well, Grandma, I got one more question,

19:06.506 --> 19:08.607
since you're not dead yet.

19:09.676 --> 19:12.110
Did you really wish
our mom was light-skinned?

19:12.111 --> 19:14.813
Bobby, don't bring that up now.

19:14.814 --> 19:17.382
I was just trying
to look out for y'all.

19:18.518 --> 19:21.019
But don't worry, Bobby,
when we meet Jesus,

19:21.020 --> 19:22.688
we're all one.

19:22.689 --> 19:25.457
Jesus doesn't see color.

19:25.458 --> 19:29.227
So what color do you think Jesus is?

19:29.228 --> 19:31.196
Well, I don't really think he's white,

19:31.197 --> 19:34.199
but I don't really think
he's black, either.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.636
So you're saying Jesus look like Drake?

19:40.973 --> 19:43.041
Yeah, yeah, that works.

19:43.042 --> 19:45.110
I was thinking more
Derek Jeter, though.

19:45.111 --> 19:47.646
No, see, you crazy, man.

19:47.647 --> 19:50.816
I-I, Jesus is more, like,
handsome and angelic,

19:50.817 --> 19:54.586
like... Jared Leto.

19:54.587 --> 19:57.522
She's with Him now.

19:57.523 --> 19:59.024
No matter what he look like.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.225
Hmm.

20:13.050 --> 20:15.217
Dad. Dad, you know I can drive.

20:15.586 --> 20:17.787
Shut up! I need to be in control.

20:17.788 --> 20:19.956
Are you scared, Jerrod?

20:19.957 --> 20:21.824
Hell yeah, I'm scared,
he's crying and driving.

20:21.825 --> 20:23.793
Jerrod, turn on the radio.

20:23.794 --> 20:26.295
I need to drown out my thoughts.

20:28.031 --> 20:30.399
â™ª Because you know
I'm all about that bass... â™ª

20:30.400 --> 20:32.068
Oh, man.

20:32.069 --> 20:35.771
Now, this is gonna be your
grandma's death song.

20:35.772 --> 20:38.608
Every time I hear it,
I'm gonna think of her.

20:38.609 --> 20:39.976
"All About That Bass"?

20:39.977 --> 20:42.745
Your grandma was all about that bass.

20:42.746 --> 20:44.580
About that bass.

20:44.581 --> 20:48.284
No treble at all.

20:48.285 --> 20:51.954
Dad, Dad, you're going
85 miles per hour.

20:51.955 --> 20:53.990
Your grandma was 85.

20:53.991 --> 20:57.727
I will now only drive 85

20:57.728 --> 21:00.663
in the memory of your grandma.

21:00.664 --> 21:03.099
This is for you, Mama!
