00:07.500 --> 00:10.000
You in there.
Open up!

00:14.000 --> 00:14.980
Where is she?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.980
Where is she?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.980
Police. K Division.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.980
See! Now, where is she?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
..She not here.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Move!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.980
Oi! You buggers!

02:59.000 --> 03:02.980
Oh, you buggers. Hey,
it's either peace or a clattering.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.980
Yours to say which.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Don't let them out!

03:19.000 --> 03:20.980
Sergeant Artherton sends
his apologies, sir.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.980
Wonders if we might see our way
clear of joining him downstairs.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Billy club, if you please,
Sergeant Drake.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Service!

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Move out of the way.
Get out of the way!

03:50.000 --> 03:52.980
Reid! Again? How the hell is
a man supposed to work

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
amid such an uproar?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Inner peace, Captain.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.980
Are you just going to stand there,
are you?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Marriage, Drake...

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
perhaps it's slackened you.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.980
Inspector, that is
the third time this month.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.980
H Division is overwhelmed, sir.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.980
Artherton... All respect
for badge and uniform is lost.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.980
We must have order, sir,
and therefore must have more men.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.980
Artherton... That or a Gatling gun.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.980
Artherton... I know not which
costs less.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.980
Artherton, it is in hand.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.980
Hmm, it's been that way
a while now, sir.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.980
The facts remain - we have neither
the funds, nor the reputation.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.980
Inspector Reid. Yes?

04:42.000 --> 04:42.980
Rumpus up on Chicksand.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.980
A man lies impaled
on iron railings there.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.980
Then send him to hospital, man.
Or the morgue.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.980
Sir, it is a copper...

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
and he lives yet.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.980
He's a copper! A stuck pig.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.980
Hold that mob back!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.980
Leave that man where he lies!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.980
Stand aside. Back, damn you!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.980
If we take him from the rail,
he's going to bleed out in seconds.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.980
A pig on a stick!

05:05.000 --> 05:07.980
Maurice? Maurice Linklater?!

05:08.000 --> 05:08.980
You fetch an ironmonger
and hacksaw.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.980
You know him? Now!

05:11.000 --> 05:12.980
Yes. Detective Sergeant,
K Division.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.980
K? What is it puts a Limehouse man
on a spike in Whitechapel?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.980
Linklater, hold fast,
we shall see you right.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.980
That's it. Jackson - morphine.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.980
By your budgeting?
I got laudanum.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, God.

05:29.000 --> 05:29.980
All right, we've got you.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.980
All right, sir.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.980
We're going to need a foot
or two still in him,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.980
so you're going to saw right here -
clean and quick.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.980
More juice, give him more juice!

05:39.000 --> 05:40.980
That was all I had and that was
enough to drown a bear.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.980
Sergeant, you are to travel with him.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.980
On arrival at the hospital, they are
to understand he is a policeman.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.980
Insist on Mr Treves. If he is not
in surgery within the hour,

05:49.000 --> 05:49.980
I shall have heads!

05:50.000 --> 05:50.980
Yes, sir.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.980
Hold still, Maurice. Hold still.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.980
Morphine.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Get it analysed, get certain.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Not the girl she once was.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.980
At least she profits, however.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
A tart then?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Little sign of a struggle
before he went through the glass.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
When the rail lanced him...

06:44.000 --> 06:45.980
..the wound was direct,
almost perpendicular -

06:46.000 --> 06:48.980
back through front.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.980
It went through clean.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.980
Fell down straight.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.980
And he is, I would say,
approaching 200 pounds,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
so we must assume that he was...

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
..projected by more than one man.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Unless he flew.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.980
One hour more, they'd have
lit a fire,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.980
used that rail for a spit
and ate him.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.980
A policeman so violently humiliated,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.980
a street thronging to celebrate -
a culprit must be found.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.980
And a meaty correction delivered

07:30.000 --> 07:32.980
so that this multitude may
see it swift and clear.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.980
I'm here with you, Maurice.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.980
Bennet Drake?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.980
Is that you? Yes, it is, brother.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.980
Then I must be in the shit.
What happened back there, Maurice?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.980
Passing Christchurch now, ain't we?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.980
We are. You remember that verger?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.980
Verger?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.980
Ackford, yeah.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.980
Took us a week to fill that barrel.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Sold him piss for apple cider, eh?

08:03.000 --> 08:03.980
We're none of us the boys we were.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.980
I'm asking again,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.980
what befell you, brother?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
These streets.

08:14.000 --> 08:14.980
The sufferings felt here,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
as nothing to what comes.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
It will fall...

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
..like the Red Sea.
Like the Red Sea, Bennie.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.980
Right, hold him steady.
Take the brace.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Hold still, sir.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.980
I want that man scrubbed
and prepared now, Jarvis. Mr Treves.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.980
Inspector. My thanks.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.980
A man of your skill -
this man is lucky.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.980
- We shall see about that.
- More, by Christ.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
That morphine barely touched him.
Another dose, then the chloroform.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.980
As we travelled here,
and it made no sense, sir,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.980
but he spoke of something coming,

09:09.000 --> 09:10.980
like a wave of suffering.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.980
His meaning?

09:13.000 --> 09:13.980
He spoke no more of it.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Leastwise nothing that
might be made sense of.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.980
But he was frighted, sir,
and earnest in that fright.

09:23.000 --> 09:23.980
We must hope he lives.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.980
There is no man better to save him
than this man Treves, here.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.980
First appendicectomy
this country has seen,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.980
performed right here at his hands,
June '88.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
This is Treves, eh? Mm-hm.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.980
Hmm, he's very good.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Inspector, your American
will extinguish his cheroot
this moment.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Hey!

09:52.000 --> 09:53.980
Treves.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.980
Mr American?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.980
That man's sternum,
is that a bruise, there?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.980
It is.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.980
It's about the size of a fist,
you might say?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.980
I might.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You observe any other trauma
on the body?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.980
Aside from the self-evident,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.980
historical shattering of the patella
and upper thigh, here,

10:12.000 --> 10:13.980
some infection, pock-marking.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.980
Prior needling, most like
for management of this knee's pain.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.980
Now, may I continue?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah, knock yourself out.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
You described those rooms, who
we might imagine the tenant to be?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I was...getting there. Erm...

10:34.000 --> 10:36.980
Well, we questioned whether
Maurice, here,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.980
went there with his badge out or
with something else altogether.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.980
You'll let me through, God damn it!

10:44.000 --> 10:45.980
Maurice, do you live?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.980
Inspector Shine, you will remove
yourself and Sergeant Barton

10:49.000 --> 10:50.980
from my operating theatre

10:51.000 --> 10:52.980
or I shall remove
your nose from your face.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Are we understood?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Inspector.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
We need to talk, Edmund.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.980
If it was a case that brought him
to Whitechapel and this woman...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.980
Who's to say it was not?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.980
..then I would have the file,
Jedediah.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.980
File? Hmm. You think it only
H Division that faces down mayhem?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.980
That we at Limehouse do nought
but dunk biscuits in our tea?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.980
Besides, as you know,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.980
we lack your taste
for clerical work, Inspector.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.980
This crime, a policeman,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.980
we must be seen to be remorseless
in our pursuit of it.

11:29.000 --> 11:29.980
Then I am ideal.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.980
While you take your hand-lens
and your great brains

11:33.000 --> 11:35.980
and apply it to
whatever chimes in those rooms,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.980
I shall pull up every paving stone
from Chicksand to Pennyfields.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.980
Wherever this Chinky miss hides,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.980
she will be found and rattled for
the truth of it

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
till her teeth drop out.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.980
May I speak with him, Treves?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.980
You may not and must not.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.980
Most like he will still die.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.980
But what little chance
he has of surviving,

11:56.000 --> 11:56.980
it's only rest that will secure it,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.980
rest and peace.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Am I understood, inspectors?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.980
All that we need from the rooms
on Chicksand shall now

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
have been returned to Leman Street.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.980
Good day to you, Mr Merrick.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.980
Good day to you, Inspector.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.980
No-one never told you
it's rude to stare?

12:23.000 --> 12:23.980
Reid knows the Elephant Man?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.980
That's Mr Merrick to you.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.980
On rare occasion, he may travel
and leave the city for a while.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.980
When he does, the men at H Division
provide escort.

12:33.000 --> 12:33.980
Good day, sir.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Good...good day to you.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.980
Mr Merrick.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.980
He's a friend of yours, Reid?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.980
I wouldn't say that.
I admire him, though.

12:44.000 --> 12:44.980
His life, the suffering,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.980
forced to wear without
what others hide within

12:47.000 --> 12:50.980
and yet I have never known him less
than courteous, considerate, hopeful.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.980
The two of you back to Leman Street,
make a start.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.980
Where are you going?

12:55.000 --> 12:55.980
If that woman was indeed tart,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.980
there is but one individual who
I would trust help me identify her.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
So, I go to take tea with your wife.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.980
The day a girl like that
goes unnoticed here, well,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.980
I shall be seeking
other employment, myself.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.980
And yet she refused your entreaties?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.980
Indeed.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.980
Two years past,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.980
recently disembarked
from a Hong Kong steamer,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.980
she turned her pretty nose up
and assured me

13:30.000 --> 13:31.980
she had no call to demean herself,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.980
so I quite took offence, Inspector.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.980
I'm sure.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.980
She travelled beneath
the moniker Blush -

13:40.000 --> 13:41.980
Blush Pang.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.980
Beautiful.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.980
And she made no hint, then,
of how it was

13:46.000 --> 13:47.980
she expected to support herself?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.980
None. Although she clearly lacked
the sufficient low self-esteem

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
to send herself to
a sweatshop or scullery.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.980
But, Inspector, I had no doubt
of her ability to do so.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Support herself, that is.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Before you go...

14:12.000 --> 14:13.980
Charity, will you fetch
Mr Reid's shirts?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.980
You will let me know if
there is anything else you require -

14:17.000 --> 14:19.980
some fruit, a chop for your larder.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh, I manage quite well, thank you.
Of course.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Thank you, sir.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.980
This, madam...this remains...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.980
Between ourselves.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
He knows nothing.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.980
Blush Pang - the girl's name.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.980
No bawd, I am told.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.980
Then those funds raised how?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.980
He confers with his kinsman.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
(Quiet, sh.)

15:23.000 --> 15:24.980
Miss Pang's morphine.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.980
Getting it analysed,
getting certain.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.980
The station house
is a pit of filth, Reid.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.980
Fine, I shall add rat-catcher
to the roll of staff

15:33.000 --> 15:34.980
Sergeant Artherton craves, shall I?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.980
Does he offer anything else,
beyond complaint?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.980
Oh, he does.
Our surgeon has a theory.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Indeed? Let's hear it, then.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.980
Drake's friend Linklater,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.980
the distance flown from window
to rail,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.980
we've assumed more
than one assailant. We have.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.980
And yet the lack
of disturbance in the room,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.980
absence of other recent trauma
to the body,

15:55.000 --> 15:55.980
as we've discussed,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.980
he's not the stripe of man
to go down without a struggle.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.980
He is not. And so?

16:00.000 --> 16:00.980
Ten years past,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.980
I spent a winter crewing
sea-draggers out of San Francisco.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.980
It's a hard life, I wouldn't
commend it to anyone.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.980
Even you, Drake.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Get to it, Captain. I am, Reid.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Frisco...

16:14.000 --> 16:17.980
..shitty weather, ugly women

16:18.000 --> 16:19.980
and working the Pacific Railroad.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.980
Celestials.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.980
Chinamen.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.980
And one such I knew.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.980
He was a monk, they said,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.980
though he drank and whored like
a man running from God,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.980
not the reverse.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.980
This monk, he had
a particular way of raising funds -

16:35.000 --> 16:35.980
circus tricks, in the main.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.980
But one night, I saw him
do things with his body

16:38.000 --> 16:39.980
that ought not to be done -

16:40.000 --> 16:41.980
bricks broken
on the back of his neck,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.980
timber cleaved in two

16:45.000 --> 16:46.980
with one blow of his fist,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
men struck...

16:50.000 --> 16:50.980
..here,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.980
knocked clean off their toes,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
thrown two, three yards.

16:57.000 --> 16:57.980
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.980
And the only mark on
Sergeant Linklater's body

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
was a circular bruise to the sternum.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.980
You ever punch a man
clean off his feet, Sergeant?

17:10.000 --> 17:10.980
With respect, sir, if I had,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.980
I wouldn't be here coppering
my life away, would I?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.980
So you suggest, then, that
there may be one such man here,

17:20.000 --> 17:20.980
now, among us?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.980
If so, what took him
to Miss Pang's rooms

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
to throw your friend from her window?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.980
Gaming chit for Chinese dominoes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.980
Is this how she profits?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.980
Do you know any oriental
gaming houses, Sergeant?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.980
A man does not have to search far.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.980
There's only two streets of China
in this city.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
They both fall within the beat
of your man Linklater.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.980
These men are collected on
the docksides of Hong Kong, Macau,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
waged sleepless on
British India steamships.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.980
They are 200 now, their number
grows with every docking.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.980
Why do they not go home?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.980
It's the same the world over,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.980
the Chinatowns of Manila,
Frisco, San Diego,

21:05.000 --> 21:05.980
they can't.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.980
They are worked and abandoned.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.980
No promise of return,
no knowledge of how to survive here.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
It is a purgatory,
which grows by increment.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.980
Lost men gather here and find
what they can.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Whilst others profit.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Stand aside, H Division.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.980
Men of Whitechapel.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.980
Come for dominoes, have we?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.980
The rooms Linklater was thrown from,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.980
the woman there goes
by the name of Blush Pang.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Evidence collected there
brings us here.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.980
Of those interviewed, we are told
this is the work of but...

22:00.000 --> 22:00.980
one man.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Reid!

22:07.000 --> 22:09.980
Edmund, this is a K Division case.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Then best you listen
to my American, Jedediah.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.980
Look at him, slumped in his shorts.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.980
You think him caught
getting his jollifications?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Of a kind.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.980
Pockmarks. Same manner found
on your sergeant.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.980
And your point?

22:33.000 --> 22:33.980
This here had a taste,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.980
it's the same as taken from
the woman Pang's apartments.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.980
This needling, you think
morphine-mania joins the two men?

22:42.000 --> 22:42.980
No.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.980
No!

22:45.000 --> 22:46.980
Besides, no law is broke.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.980
He may freely take morphine
for the pain of that knee,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.980
allow himself respite so as
to go about his work untroubled,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.980
such as protecting
this woman from an attacker.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.980
Whichever, Sergeant.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.980
But now, this man becomes relevant.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
So who is he?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.980
This...German. "Florian Janker?"

23:06.000 --> 23:07.980
That a language you know, Edmund?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.980
No. But this, "Barmen",

23:11.000 --> 23:12.980
it is a town in Germany.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.980
And this, "60"...

23:15.000 --> 23:15.980
Birthday gift?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.980
He look 60 to you, Captain?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Not a day over 35.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Got something here,
caught in his spinal column.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Cut with such venom,
the blade sheared.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Is that Chinese? Show me.

23:42.000 --> 23:42.980
I know that sign.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.980
The Three Harmonies Society,
or Triads.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.980
That's some special purpose
knowledge there, Chief.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.980
Ten years Hong Kong Police.
Were you not, Jedediah?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.980
This action here,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
it is a land grab.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.980
One clan hoping
to place influence over another.

23:59.000 --> 23:59.980
Whatever his motivations,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.980
it is this which Sergeant Linklater
found himself amidst,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.980
this which laid claim
to our German, here.

24:07.000 --> 24:07.980
This is not China.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.980
No, Edmund, it is London.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.980
And this here - nothing but
our chickens come home to roost.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.980
London is our Empire's heart

24:16.000 --> 24:17.980
but the East End, its arsehole.

24:18.000 --> 24:18.980
Its sins,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.980
committed out in
the subjugated world yonder,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
they are shat out right here.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I shall turn this town over, Edmund.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.980
No matter my Sergeant's sins -
whoever did this,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
I shall dig them out
and see to their pacifying.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
You men can see yourselves home,
I'm sure.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.980
No, no, no, do not disturb for me.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
You concentrate.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.980
You do not wish your wife
to fetch your dinner for you?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.980
Fetched me own for many a year now,
you know.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I am stuck in my ways.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Come here.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.980
Where did you learn such skill?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I learn it now, didn't I?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Then you master it fast.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.980
Something tugs at you, Bennet.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Does it not?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.980
It's an old friend of mine,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.980
one I have not seen
for too many years.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.980
Police, he is,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.980
and lies now, near death,
at the London.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
He was attacked. But...

26:41.000 --> 26:42.980
..there are those who believe

26:43.000 --> 26:45.980
Maurice bound in some way
to his attacker,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
a way that does him no credit.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I have no old friends close to me...

26:55.000 --> 26:58.980
..no-one to remember me as I was,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
before Long Susan found me.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Only you, Bennet.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You make me what I am now.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
If you wish to go help your friend...

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
..you do so.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.980
Whitechapel
is not Chinatown. No, it's worse.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.980
At the very least,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.980
those men know what they want most
out of this life. And that is?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.980
To leave this place, goddamn it.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
You and me...

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
..we got the funds.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.980
One mile from here, there are ships
that could deliver us to Shanghai,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Siam, Mandalay!

27:47.000 --> 27:48.980
All our enemies are dead and gone,
darling.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.980
There's no call to hide any longer.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.980
However, these corridors have
come to feel like home, now. Home?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.980
What the hell is home?
Home is a brickwork anchor.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.980
What about Reid?
You would just leave him?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.980
He's welcome to tag along.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.980
What and leave this place?

28:06.000 --> 28:06.980
He would stop breathing.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.980
Then screw him.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.980
It's you and me, darling,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
it's the dream that joined us.
Remember?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Of course I remember.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I'd sit with him a whiles.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Maurice?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Hello?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
What've you been about, Maurice?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.980
Oh, Mr Merrick, my apologies.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I didn't...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.980
You have been out walking, sir?

30:07.000 --> 30:11.980
The hospital garden is
a little more peaceful at this hour.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.980
And you?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.980
I...I visit a friend, sir.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.980
Mr Linklater?

30:19.000 --> 30:23.980
Mr Treves says
that there is hope for him.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Of a kind, sir... Yes.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Good night. Good night.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.980
Sir.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I found this in
Sergeant Linklater's personals.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's a cargo docket.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
300 pounds of raw tar opium.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.980
Hong Kong to London

31:04.000 --> 31:05.980
and a name here - Pang.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
For collection by Maurice Linklater.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.980
Sergeant, opium is not
yet contraband.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.980
If your friend...
Friendship is trust, sir,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and I do trust him no longer.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.980
So are we to assume her
his taskmaster?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.980
Taking orders from a woman?

31:27.000 --> 31:27.980
He's not the breed of man for that.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.980
What breed is he?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.980
The kind to co-ordinate
this trade himself?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.980
That's not the Maurice I know.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
He is a follower, not a captain.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Miss Pang's opium.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Oh, Maurice.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Fighter policeman.

33:33.000 --> 33:33.980
Wait!

33:34.000 --> 33:35.980
What is it you want? Where is she?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.980
Blush? I know not. I seek her also.

33:38.000 --> 33:38.980
You lie.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.980
The man you work for, who has
her order this opium, he keeps her.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.980
I work for no-one,
I work for no-one, unlike you, sir,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.980
here on order of
the Three Harmonies Society

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
to steal Blush Pang's trade.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.980
I'm here to take my sister home...

33:54.000 --> 33:58.980
Sister?..to restore honour
to her mother and father.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.980
Where do you hide her? Wait!

34:00.000 --> 34:01.980
One man is murdered by your hand,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.980
another is sure to go that way soon.
Would you add another?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.980
One dead British policeman -
one less evil in this world.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.980
It was a policeman who stole her,
many years ago.

34:11.000 --> 34:11.980
A British policeman?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.980
In Hong Kong? My sister,
where is she?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.980
Your sister was brought here
to trade opium.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.980
The man you hunt, the man
that brought your sister here,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
is not this man.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.980
Are you well?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
I'm all right, sir.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You heard that, Sergeant?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.980
Inspector Jedediah Shine -

35:05.000 --> 35:07.980
ten years Hong Kong Police
before he landed at Limehouse.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.980
A man so respected.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
And so eager to blind me
to the truth.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.980
I begin to wonder

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
if we should not do what we can
to obscure ourselves.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
The man...

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
..is a suet pudding.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
He who wrecked The Pearl last night,
however...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
..it is your brother come
to find you, is it not?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
What does he want here?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
He may kill you.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.980
Then it is all gravy.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.980
For I would surely die
without you...

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
my dear.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Had a bill in the post, have we?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.980
Duggan, you cannot do this.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Do you forget, Miss Hart?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
You, your life here...

37:08.000 --> 37:10.980
..every success you might measure,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.980
none of it...none of it
would have come to pass

37:14.000 --> 37:15.980
without my generosity.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.980
As your landlord and benefactor,
I can do what I like,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
because I own you.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And what a pretty parcel to own.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.980
Ah, Mr Reid, news for you.
The Kraut you sent word for...

37:32.000 --> 37:33.980
Yes?..some kind of chemist.

37:34.000 --> 37:34.980
Chemist?! Indeed.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.980
I passed the communication
to Captain Jackson.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
He seemed quite taken with it, sir.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.980
Florian Janker - Bayer Laboratories,
murdered March '88.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Only suspect is Johan Carsten,
aged 31 at the time.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.980
So this must be Carsten?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.980
Says here he worked at
Bayer Laboratories also.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.980
He's a chemist,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
not accomplished
but a chemist nonetheless.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.980
My friend here got me curious.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.980
The one you treated
to Miss Pang's morphine?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
If it was morphine.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.980
He's been...testy.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.980
More so than you might expect.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.980
Imagine Drake, here,
with a rash on his conkers -

38:23.000 --> 38:24.980
that but worse.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.980
Had me confounded

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
until that man.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.980
A chemist found,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.980
cut down whilst
in the company of a woman,

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Blush Pang...

38:38.000 --> 38:40.980
..his thighs puckered
with signs of this substance.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
The same substance we believe
Maurice Linklater may have taken.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.980
And you...

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
have reverse-engineered it.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.980
I have. And so what is it?

38:53.000 --> 38:53.980
Syringe, please.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
Let's find out why people are
killing each other over this juice.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
And some privacy.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.980
Can you say it?
(Can you say it?)

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Can you say it? (Can you say it?)

40:04.000 --> 40:06.980
(I can. I can.)

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
(Then say it.)

40:21.000 --> 40:22.980
Jackson!

40:23.000 --> 40:26.980
You listen to me,
you listen good.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.980
Morphine...

40:29.000 --> 40:31.980
takes the body with
tenfold the power of opium.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
This stuff...

40:37.000 --> 40:37.980
..stronger still.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
It comes up in you like lava.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
Nothing for it but to surrender.
But that step taken...

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Think of a cold morning...

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
..ice on the inside
of your window...

40:55.000 --> 40:58.980
..you're warm in your bed
with a woman clasped beside you,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
no call to ever move more.

41:09.000 --> 41:09.980
Drink your coffee!

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Drink it!

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
A man might have that, now,
whenever he wished for it.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.980
It is life
stripped of all judgment.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.980
No pain, no hunger,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.980
no sorrow, no tomorrow.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.980
Qualities much in demand hereabout.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.980
Morphine is dear, however.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.980
The cost of such a narcotic
must be likewise.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.980
Not if it were cooked from
the source, from the tar itself.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.980
Tar that is sat waiting
for Maurice Linklater to collect it.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.980
And no law yet made is broke.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.980
Jedediah Shine's lackeys
may set up stall

41:46.000 --> 41:47.980
outside this station house,
should they choose.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.980
What Linklater spoke to you of in
the carriage, a wave of suffering...

41:51.000 --> 41:52.980
Falling like the red sea.

41:53.000 --> 41:53.980
Reid, this gear gets sold cheap,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.980
the men and women of this quarter

41:56.000 --> 41:58.980
are going to grind their children
for bread to find spending for it.

41:59.000 --> 41:59.980
No. Not here,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.980
not whilst I breathe.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Linklater must talk to us.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.980
Jackson, this...this juice.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.980
Is it really so simple to make?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Even you might do so, Drake.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Then make some more.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.980
Sergeant Linklater
is to be left in peace, Mr Reid,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
as you well know.

42:38.000 --> 42:38.980
Do you know, Sergeant,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.980
when we first plucked you
from that pike on Chicksand Street,

42:43.000 --> 42:43.980
I thought, above all,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.980
that the sanctity of this force
must be protected.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.980
Because, to those who wish
to live in peace hereabout,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
we must be their buttress
to that aim.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.980
We found a powdered substance

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
on the dressing table of a woman
named Pang...

43:02.000 --> 43:05.980
..discovered its nature
and made our own,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
here.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.980
I beg you, sir, give it to me.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.980
One or two questions answered

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
and I shall.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Stay here, get it all.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.980
Now, this is what I know already -

43:43.000 --> 43:44.980
this narcotic for which you clamour

43:45.000 --> 43:47.980
is about to be launched
onto our streets.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.980
Do I have it right, Sergeant?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.980
You do, sir.
Now, please, let me have it!

43:53.000 --> 43:56.980
No, not yet. The woman,
Blush, Blush Pang,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.980
she supplies the opium
dens on your watch?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.980
And then the German, Carsten,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.980
the chemist landed in your
hands. What was it he sold you?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.980
A promised relief to the
pain in your knee?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.980
He spoke of a laboratory
where he worked.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.980
Of what he himself had helped
to make. A drug, like morphine,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.980
which they wished to develop.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.980
To be named heroin, sir.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.980
And he made this heroin
for you and Miss Pang?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
The narcotic, where is it cooked?

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
Benny, for all the years we have
known each other - take pity on me.

44:37.000 --> 44:37.980
No, Maurice.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.980
You spoke of that suffering,

44:40.000 --> 44:40.980
knew the part you played in it.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.980
You had this coming.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Now, you do what you can to make
amends, and you speak.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.980
Benny! And your commander, Sergeant,
you name him.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
And all his crimes.

44:54.000 --> 44:54.980
Benny, you've no idea...

44:55.000 --> 44:57.980
Come, Sergeant Drake, we waste too
much time. No! No!

44:58.000 --> 45:00.980
Return, I'll tell you,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
I'll tell you everything.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.980
The cookhouse, where is it cooked?

45:07.000 --> 45:07.980
Chicksand. Chicksand!?

45:08.000 --> 45:08.980
Where we found you?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.980
Where?! The ginnels beneath,
dug into the earth.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.980
Now, the commander.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.980
List his crimes
so I may bring him down.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.980
It is not as if we do not know
of his corruption.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.980
So you speak and make amends,
Sergeant.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.980
We just need to hear the words.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.980
Only say it, Sergeant, say it.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Juice first.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Juice first.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.980
Now, confirm it.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Confirm it.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.980
Confirm it! Maurice!

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Confirm it! Confirm it, damn you!

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Inspector Reid!

46:11.000 --> 46:12.980
You ignore my explicit instructions.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.980
This man is to be left in peace.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.980
This man bears great responsibility
for the future welfare

46:17.000 --> 46:18.980
of this parish, Mr Treves.

46:19.000 --> 46:19.980
I must have his knowledge!

46:20.000 --> 46:22.980
And I must do all that I can
to ensure his survival.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.980
Out, Inspector!

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
This moment!

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
All of it, get rid of it, all right.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.980
H Division. Now, you got a cookhouse
here,

46:55.000 --> 46:56.980
you're going to tell me where it is!

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
You're going to tell me
where it is now!

47:10.000 --> 47:12.980
Don't tell me you don't
know anything... Sergeant!

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Over here, boys!

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Nobody move!

47:25.000 --> 47:27.980
No law is broken here.
This is a legitimate business.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.980
You are set on bringing

47:29.000 --> 47:31.980
a special kind of hell to these
streets, Miss Pang...

47:32.000 --> 47:32.980
My streets!

47:33.000 --> 47:36.980
And here, my word is law.
Get her in irons.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.980
She is not for you to take.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.980
She is for me to return back
to where she belongs.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I don't think so, my friend.
Not this time.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
The hammer is cocked, friend.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.980
Quick as you are, brass is quicker.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.980
What is it you believe?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.980
That even if you fight your way 6,000
miles from here to Hong Kong,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.980
that you might there make of her
the innocent she once was?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
There she will see China.
She will know who she is.

49:10.000 --> 49:10.980
China itself is changing

49:11.000 --> 49:12.980
and is corrupted by this country
here.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.980
A corruption that cannot now be
reversed. As with her.

49:16.000 --> 49:16.980
For she now is London.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
And her heart,
I suspect, as black as soot.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.980
Well, Inspector.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.980
Now, as ever, the great Edmund Reid
is one step ahead of his rivals.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.980
What work you have done
for your people.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.980
This narcotic, this creeping evil

49:43.000 --> 49:44.980
which otherwise would have broken
lives.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.980
You are owed great thanks. My thanks
also for delivering these two to me.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.980
In particular, this murdering
pyjama-fighter.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.980
Cuffs, sir.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Thank you, Constable.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Jedediah.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.980
If you want him, you fight him.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
You are in Whitechapel now.
My streets, my laws.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.980
If you have it in you?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
You take him.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Be my guest.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Wish me to fight
for your entertainment, do you?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Quite the Roman Emperor, ain't you?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.980
I am Jedediah Shine,

50:46.000 --> 50:49.980
ten years undefeated
in all divisional competition.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.980
No man yet found
drinks his tea blacker.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.980
Know you only as my family's curse.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.980
I know you do.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.980
Word has it you are quite some tiger
when your tail is pulled.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
What say I give it a tug?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.980
She was just a child
and you stole her.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
That girl. She was never a child.

52:24.000 --> 52:24.980
Take them.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.980
You arrest her on what charge?
She protected an officer.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.980
Whatever I choose. Murder?
The theft of a boiled sweet?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.980
I care not. But you will not see
her again, Jedediah.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Not this young and lovely,
leastwise.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.980
Do not think your wider corruption

52:48.000 --> 52:50.980
and avarice is obscured to me,
Inspector.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.980
Or to the wider world in due course.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.980
Sergeant Linklater, a man covered
in guilt and so close to death,

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
he will ask for his grace
one hour or the next.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Inspector.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.980
I hear you've been getting
loquacious.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
What was I to do, Inspector?

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
I shake at how vulnerable
you have become.

54:11.000 --> 54:18.000
And what else you might reveal
to men such as Edmund Reid...

54:19.000 --> 54:21.980
..if denied your comfort.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Jedediah, I swear on my life,
I am your loyal soldier.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
I know it, sir.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
Which is why I ask you...

54:43.000 --> 54:43.980
..one last service.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Name it.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.980
Well, you are to incriminate

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
that inspector for me.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.980
That is a mighty dose, Jedediah.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.980
And you a mighty man,

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Maurice Linklater.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Clumsy bugger...

56:02.000 --> 56:04.980
I know it painful, Sergeant,
but it cannot be helped.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Good men may go bad.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Although I am yet to see
a bad man go good.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.980
The world is unjust in that way.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Indeed.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.980
My brothers, you do not send word
for me to join you for a glass?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.980
A more sensitive soul
might take insult.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
You have some brass coming in here.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Do you not notice, Jedediah,
that you are watched?

56:45.000 --> 56:46.980
That the people of this quarter
follow all that you do.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.980
And they are right to follow me,
Edmund.

56:51.000 --> 56:51.980
I lead well.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.980
No. You lead with venality,
lies, corruption.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.980
And you are a fine one to speak,
Edmund Upright.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.980
Pure as the driven, are you not?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.980
I make no claims for myself.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Then how is a man to know you?

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
By your actions alone?

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Oh.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Word has not reached you?

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
My sergeant has succumbed
this night.

57:23.000 --> 57:23.980
From his injuries?

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
Mr Treves is yet to decide. But...

57:28.000 --> 57:31.980
..there is word, Edmund, that you
were come upon in my man's rooms.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
A syringe...

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
..a dose of narcotics administered
to Sergeant Linklater.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.980
I do not credit it myself.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
But Mr Treves...

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
..he is a stickler for that version
of the truth.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Ta-ta, old cock.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.980
How do, Mr Merrick?

58:13.000 --> 58:13.980
Why the long face?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
You are a disgrace to badge
and uniform.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.980
Talk of the wolf.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.980
You will not bring your Leman
Street ways to this hospital again.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.980
But... No, sir!

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Re-enforcements.

58:27.305 --> 58:33.867
