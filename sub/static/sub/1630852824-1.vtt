00:58.643 --> 01:00.578
Close it up one time. Open.

01:01.779 --> 01:03.280
- Too tight?
- Mm-mm.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.147
Turn. Close.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.420
- Grip it. It's good?
- Mm-hm.

01:31.075 --> 01:32.309
One, two.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.410
One, two

01:33.443 --> 01:34.712
Again.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.713
Now go under.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.214
Yeah!

01:37.247 --> 01:39.984
Yeah, ready? Slip, slip.
Yeah. Again.

01:40.018 --> 01:41.653
Sh, sh!
One up, one down.

01:41.686 --> 01:42.887
- Push, push!
- Good!

01:42.920 --> 01:44.321
- Push, push!
- One more time.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.057
- Push, push!
- Ready? One, two, three. Under.

01:46.090 --> 01:47.491
Yeah.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:50.028 --> 01:51.261
Break.

01:51.294 --> 01:52.597
Double it.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.317
<i>Boxing fans,</i>

02:14.351 --> 02:17.521
<i>make some noise!</i>

03:03.500 --> 03:04.736
Jane.

03:38.703 --> 03:39.771
Be right with you.

03:43.574 --> 03:44.675
Anything else?

03:44.709 --> 03:46.244
Asked for diet.
This is regular.

03:46.276 --> 03:48.112
You didn't bring me extra lemons
for the water.

03:48.146 --> 03:50.081
- Sorry.
- Don't expect a tip.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.916
- You serious?
- Yep.

03:52.382 --> 03:54.619
Kaylee, would you please
clean up station number ten.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.787
People are waiting.

04:19.110 --> 04:20.711
Kaylee, if you want food,

04:20.745 --> 04:23.047
just, uh, tell the kitchen at
the beginning of your shift.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.151
- Okay?
- Sorry.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.288
There's no reason to be sorry,
just let them know next time.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.033
Can I help you?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.902
Are you K.O. Uppeshau,
the boxer?

04:47.504 --> 04:49.406
- Yeah.
- You're my favorite fighter.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.309
How come I never see you
fight anymore?

04:53.311 --> 04:54.377
Got a bad back.

04:54.812 --> 04:56.513
Oh, I... I didn't know that.

04:58.616 --> 04:59.917
Can I get a selfie real quick?

05:00.450 --> 05:01.518
Yeah, sure.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.692
Thank you so much.

05:38.856 --> 05:40.124
You been sleepin' with
the blade?

05:41.359 --> 05:42.693
- Yeah.
- Good.

05:43.861 --> 05:45.062
Got all the money, right?

05:45.763 --> 05:46.898
Yeah.

05:47.565 --> 05:49.432
Let's hope this motherfucker
got some news.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.117
You got it?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.776
This is Lisa.
She recruits for The Bird.

07:07.144 --> 07:08.446
Go ahead. Show 'em.

07:11.315 --> 07:12.950
This was posted
a week ago.

07:21.792 --> 07:22.860
Is it her?

07:26.864 --> 07:27.965
Yeah, it's her.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.137
The fuck this shit even mean?

07:33.204 --> 07:36.073
NTV means "Native."
"Off The Boat" is underage.

07:36.107 --> 07:39.343
The umbrella means no condoms,
and HH is for half hour.

07:41.012 --> 07:42.246
Tell 'em how it works.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.749
I find girls and
bring 'em to the motel.

07:45.449 --> 07:46.484
If there's native girls,

07:46.516 --> 07:48.019
we set 'em up with
this guy, Bobby.

07:48.352 --> 07:49.754
I think he posted this.

07:50.321 --> 07:52.256
And Lisa is bringing

07:52.289 --> 07:53.924
a new batch of girls
over tomorrow.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.061
Bobby's supposed to show up.

07:57.795 --> 07:59.697
We can plug you in
with this batch.

08:00.398 --> 08:02.600
Listen, Kaylee. If you want to
go through with this,

08:02.633 --> 08:04.368
you have to be all in
and play the part.

08:05.036 --> 08:06.237
And once you're there,

08:06.470 --> 08:07.571
you're on your own.

08:11.308 --> 08:13.077
Just tell me where to be
and I'll be there.

08:43.073 --> 08:44.408
Go!

08:45.242 --> 08:47.645
Good. Break the... break the...
break the grip, break the grip.

08:47.678 --> 08:50.247
Get your hips out.
Break it. Break the grip.

08:50.281 --> 08:51.582
Good. Good.

08:52.683 --> 08:54.985
All right, shoe.
Good sprawl.

08:59.023 --> 09:00.424
Oh, watch it, watch it.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.993
Guillotine, guillotine.

09:03.394 --> 09:06.063
Good. Good.

09:06.097 --> 09:07.198
[grunting

09:07.231 --> 09:08.299
Great.

09:10.234 --> 09:11.936
Don't give him your back.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.604
All right, try to get your
shoulders to the ground,

09:13.637 --> 09:14.738
try to get your shoulders.

09:15.372 --> 09:16.941
Tap.

09:17.274 --> 09:19.578
Tap. Tap.

09:20.444 --> 09:22.079
He got you.
Fuckin' tap.

09:22.613 --> 09:24.482
Tap! Tap!

09:28.285 --> 09:29.487
She's gonna hurt herself.

09:30.788 --> 09:32.256
What's goin' on
with you, K.O.?

09:32.723 --> 09:34.425
We've gone over this,
like, a hundred times.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.694
Anything could happen out there,
man, you gotta be ready.

09:37.061 --> 09:38.629
Sorry.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.698
Don't fuckin' apologize,
let's just get it together.

09:40.898 --> 09:42.333
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

09:42.766 --> 09:43.968
Let's go, get up.

09:45.336 --> 09:46.770
Get up. Come on. Ready?

09:48.172 --> 09:49.273
Go!

09:53.477 --> 09:55.212
This dude got
a lot of weight on you.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.148
You gotta be ready for
this type of size and power.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.282
A'ight?

09:58.315 --> 10:00.017
This is about survival.
Let's go.

10:02.086 --> 10:03.888
Let's go, K.O.
Come on!

10:10.127 --> 10:11.996
From your mid-section.
Turn the hip.

10:12.997 --> 10:15.600
Yep. Good. That's it, throw.
Yep. Good, good.

10:15.634 --> 10:16.667
Go ahead, go ahead.

10:19.770 --> 10:21.105
Come on,
you're lookin' good, you're good.

10:21.138 --> 10:22.973
Let's go, K.O.
Let's go, K.O.

10:27.845 --> 10:29.213
Good, there you go.

10:29.446 --> 10:30.848
Yeah, get back up high.

10:31.315 --> 10:33.250
Lift your head.

10:37.454 --> 10:39.256
Come on, deep breath,
deep breath, deep breath.

10:40.858 --> 10:43.294
Get it together.
Get up, come on. Good.

10:44.563 --> 10:45.863
Let's go,
work behind that.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.164
Hands up high.
There you go.

10:49.366 --> 10:50.868
That's what I want,
right there.

10:51.202 --> 10:53.837
Yep. Come on, come on.
Keep punchin'.

10:53.871 --> 10:55.873
Keep touchin'.
Get him off of you.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.341
Get him the fuck off of you.

10:58.008 --> 10:59.843
Come on.
Pull it together.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.851
Come on.
Get the fuck up.

11:09.353 --> 11:10.921
Pull yourself up.

11:11.222 --> 11:12.389
Hey, get the fuck up!

11:17.995 --> 11:19.063
Get up, K.O.!

11:38.515 --> 11:39.817
You need a ride back?

11:40.517 --> 11:42.319
No. I'll take the bus.

11:45.889 --> 11:46.924
What?

11:49.293 --> 11:50.761
You got somethin' to say,
say it.

11:51.596 --> 11:53.831
I mean, look,
it's been, like, two years.

11:53.864 --> 11:55.099
Two fuckin' years, K.O.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.268
That could have been anybody
in that ad, man,

11:57.301 --> 11:58.402
we just goin'.

12:00.605 --> 12:02.873
I love her like
a sister, too, but...

12:02.906 --> 12:04.408
I mean, I don't...
I don't think it's her.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.746
I'm sorry, I'm just...

12:08.445 --> 12:10.014
I'm just trying to
keep it a buck, man.

12:10.481 --> 12:12.082
But I know you already got
your mind made up.

12:23.127 --> 12:24.161
What?

12:25.929 --> 12:27.131
You're worried about me.

12:28.566 --> 12:29.800
You love me that much.

12:30.769 --> 12:32.704
Can't picture life without me.

12:32.936 --> 12:33.971
Fuck outta here.

12:34.773 --> 12:36.273
Thank you, Brick.

12:37.941 --> 12:39.209
You ain't gotta thank me.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.278
Yo, for real, though.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.180
- Be safe out there.
- All right.

13:09.173 --> 13:10.474
She's flappin'.

13:10.775 --> 13:12.042
Like a trout.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.349
Flailing her arms.

13:21.118 --> 13:23.520
I'm lookin' around for
a branch or somethin'.

13:25.856 --> 13:27.391
But there ain't nothin' around.

13:31.663 --> 13:34.231
I'm just
screamin' at her.

13:35.332 --> 13:37.167
But she doesn't get any closer.

13:42.973 --> 13:45.577
She's been swimmin' in
that river for 12 years.

13:52.149 --> 13:53.917
I tell myself she's dead.

13:55.986 --> 13:58.122
But she keeps
swimming on back to me.

14:02.694 --> 14:04.395
I used to hate those dreams.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.065
But now I look forward to them.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.270
To remind me she's
still out there swimming.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.142
Ain't nothin' I can do but wait.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.412
Thank you, Awan.

14:22.413 --> 14:25.048
I know how difficult it is
to talk about, but...

14:26.785 --> 14:27.951
that's why we're here, right?

14:29.219 --> 14:30.555
Be there for each other.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.057
Who else wants to check in?

14:40.732 --> 14:41.965
Coleman?

14:47.104 --> 14:48.238
I'm angry.

14:49.808 --> 14:52.075
Okay.
What are you angry about?

14:53.076 --> 14:54.178
No closure.

14:55.412 --> 14:56.480
No help.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.051
It was my responsibility
to keep her safe,

15:01.084 --> 15:02.352
and I failed to do so.

15:04.722 --> 15:06.190
If your daughter
was here right now,

15:06.223 --> 15:07.291
what would you
say to her?

15:08.258 --> 15:09.993
Oh, I'd take her in my arms...

15:17.968 --> 15:19.303
Fuck this. I'm sorry.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.456
Listen, um...

15:41.124 --> 15:42.594
Why don't we call it
a wrap for today

15:42.627 --> 15:44.495
and we'll meet back here
same time next week?

15:45.329 --> 15:46.463
Yeah?

15:47.866 --> 15:48.967
Thank you, everyone.

16:16.828 --> 16:17.929
You want coffee?

16:19.463 --> 16:21.064
No, I'm good. Thanks.

16:34.478 --> 16:35.580
Sit.

16:44.689 --> 16:46.123
Are you fighting again?

16:47.391 --> 16:48.458
Yeah.

16:49.359 --> 16:50.695
Any fights comin' up?

16:50.995 --> 16:53.731
Yeah. I'm gonna be gone
for a little while, so...

16:54.197 --> 16:55.633
I just wanted to stop by.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.243
So, how's Megan?

17:11.181 --> 17:12.249
What?

17:13.282 --> 17:15.285
We broke up two years ago, Ma.

17:15.954 --> 17:17.287
You know that.

17:18.690 --> 17:19.991
Forgot. I'm sorry.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.559
Oh, yeah?

17:22.224 --> 17:24.028
Look, I told you
the last time I saw you,

17:24.061 --> 17:26.030
I'm not giving you any money
until I know you're clean.

17:26.064 --> 17:27.732
I didn't come here
for money, Ma.

17:46.084 --> 17:48.118
That was the last pow wow
we went to together.

17:49.453 --> 17:50.688
Some days I keep it on
the desk,

17:50.722 --> 17:52.023
some days I put it in
the drawer.

17:59.931 --> 18:02.299
I just fuckin' wish
you would say it.

18:04.301 --> 18:05.369
Say what?

18:08.740 --> 18:10.440
Just say you wish it was me.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.177
Put the picture back, Kaylee.

18:14.277 --> 18:17.147
Not a day goes by where I don't
think about this little girl.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.650
I'm not gonna do this
with you, Kaylee,

18:18.683 --> 18:20.317
I'm not gonna play
this little game with you.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.886
I'm not leavin' here...

18:21.919 --> 18:24.154
- until you say it.
- I'm not gonna say it!

18:24.187 --> 18:27.290
You wish it was me
on that wall, missin'.

18:28.593 --> 18:30.862
And not your precious Weeta.

18:32.529 --> 18:33.965
You're over here

18:33.998 --> 18:36.668
praising and grievin'
everybody else's loved ones,

18:36.868 --> 18:38.468
you got one sittin'
right in front of you,

18:38.502 --> 18:40.203
you won't even
fuckin' acknowledge me.

19:07.999 --> 19:09.199
Goodbye, Ma.

19:30.121 --> 19:33.091
<i>On Saturday...
On this Saturday, this weekend,</i>

19:33.124 --> 19:35.193
<i>my sister's got
a big fight goin' on,</i>

19:35.225 --> 19:36.694
<i>so you are gonna be there.</i>

19:36.728 --> 19:38.629
<i>And who's gonna
be there ringside?</i>

19:38.663 --> 19:41.766
<i>I'm gonna be
supporting her on the side.</i>

19:41.799 --> 19:43.201
<i>Yep.</i>

19:43.233 --> 19:44.702
<i>Yep. And you know
I can't be there</i>

19:44.736 --> 19:46.104
<i>and can't win
without my baby sis.</i>

19:46.137 --> 19:47.672
<i>You think I'm gonna win?</i>

19:47.705 --> 19:50.007
- <i>Yeah, of course you are.</i>
- <i>You better say yes.</i>

19:50.041 --> 19:51.876
<i>Where again? When?
Tell the people.</i>

19:51.909 --> 19:53.878
- <i>Tell the people.</i>
- <i>Saturday, this weekend.</i>

19:53.911 --> 19:55.512
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Be there.</i>

19:55.545 --> 19:57.280
<i>Or else I'm gonna send her after you.</i>

19:57.314 --> 19:59.316
- <i>I will. I will.</i>
- <i>She's the rough one.</i>

20:05.823 --> 20:06.991
<i>Weeta.</i>

20:08.126 --> 20:09.292
Come here.

20:09.961 --> 20:12.130
I gotta spar a few rounds.
Just a little bit longer.

20:12.930 --> 20:14.932
I thought you said we were
leaving soon.

20:14.966 --> 20:17.400
<i>A little while longer.
We'll get some food afterward.</i>

20:17.434 --> 20:19.170
<i>That's okay. You got
your big fight comin' up.</i>

20:19.637 --> 20:21.172
- I'll walk.
- You sure?

20:21.572 --> 20:22.607
Yeah.

20:27.645 --> 20:28.946
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

20:29.080 --> 20:31.149
Don't leave like that.
Give big sis a kiss.

20:35.787 --> 20:37.521
- Text me when you get home.
- Okay.

23:46.476 --> 23:48.179
Sorry about that, ladies.

23:50.414 --> 23:51.548
Okay.

24:13.938 --> 24:14.972
How old are you?

24:15.806 --> 24:16.874
Twenty-nine.

24:18.843 --> 24:20.745
What, are you bringing me
grandmas now, Lisa?

24:21.045 --> 24:22.213
She's cute.

24:23.481 --> 24:24.849
Eh...

24:26.984 --> 24:28.185
I guess you're right.

24:30.388 --> 24:32.522
Huh. Like your cheek piercings.

24:33.991 --> 24:35.826
All right, uh...

24:36.160 --> 24:37.527
you all chill here for now.

24:38.528 --> 24:39.864
Relax.

24:40.031 --> 24:42.199
You. Come with me.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.936
All right, guys, relax.
Just make yourself at home.

25:03.654 --> 25:05.222
Hey, cheek piercings.

25:06.023 --> 25:07.091
You're up.

25:21.372 --> 25:23.707
Take a seat. Relax.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.222
So, Lisa tells me
that you're native.

25:38.789 --> 25:39.890
Yeah.

25:42.426 --> 25:43.794
You're not full, though, right?

25:44.795 --> 25:46.931
- No.
- I didn't think so.

25:48.132 --> 25:50.668
What's your mix?
Asian? Black?

25:51.602 --> 25:52.670
Cape Verdean.

25:53.237 --> 25:55.005
- Cape what?
- Cape Verdean.

25:55.473 --> 25:57.508
- Cape Verdean?
- Yeah.

25:59.110 --> 26:00.611
Where's that?

26:00.711 --> 26:04.281
It's a cluster of islands
off the west coast of Africa.

26:04.982 --> 26:06.183
That's a pretty cool mix.

26:14.959 --> 26:16.827
Your mom from there? Dad?

26:17.995 --> 26:20.498
- Dad.
- That's cool.

26:22.733 --> 26:24.368
Oh! I'm clean.

26:25.402 --> 26:26.437
Well, good for you.

26:28.139 --> 26:29.206
Give me your arm.

26:35.079 --> 26:36.213
I'm not askin'.

26:50.828 --> 26:52.029
All right, clinch your fist.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.131
Yeah.

27:06.677 --> 27:07.745
All right.

27:10.014 --> 27:12.249
Shh... shh.

27:13.652 --> 27:14.885
Relax.

27:15.853 --> 27:17.888
Relax. Almost done.

27:20.124 --> 27:21.759
There you go.

27:24.028 --> 27:25.896
You're all good. Okay?

27:27.231 --> 27:28.499
You good?

27:29.533 --> 27:30.734
You're good.

27:31.335 --> 27:32.703
You see?

27:36.740 --> 27:38.209
Pretty good shit, huh?

27:40.177 --> 27:41.712
All right, get up.

27:49.987 --> 27:52.189
Take your clothes off.
Over there.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.480
Hm. You're jacked.

28:17.014 --> 28:18.650
I like your tattoos.

28:21.252 --> 28:23.053
All right, just look at me.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.356
There you go.

28:25.389 --> 28:26.457
Pout your lip.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.662
Good.

28:31.228 --> 28:33.130
Okay. Turn around.

28:34.898 --> 28:36.433
So, you got any siblings?

28:38.135 --> 28:39.503
Yeah.

28:39.536 --> 28:41.005
Look over your shoulder.

28:42.039 --> 28:43.507
Brother? Sister?

28:43.941 --> 28:45.809
- Sister.
- Oh, yeah?

28:46.310 --> 28:47.511
Older? Younger?

28:49.113 --> 28:50.180
Younger.

28:51.650 --> 28:52.816
Is she hot?

28:53.817 --> 28:55.185
Take some selfies.

29:03.927 --> 29:05.262
Get any work done?

29:07.431 --> 29:09.668
- No.
- Tits real? Ass real?

29:10.968 --> 29:12.870
- Yeah.
- You clean?

29:13.003 --> 29:14.972
Yeah.

29:15.306 --> 29:17.041
Okay. Come here.

29:18.842 --> 29:21.945
I got a guy who likes
Native girls.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.148
You're gonna meet him tonight.

29:26.785 --> 29:28.052
Go over there.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.292
Bend over.

29:39.196 --> 29:40.665
Yeah, good, just like that.

29:42.099 --> 29:43.167
Okay.

29:44.134 --> 29:45.369
Spread your legs.

29:47.438 --> 29:48.673
Okay, good, yeah.

29:49.808 --> 29:51.875
Yeah, just stay like that
for me.

29:53.611 --> 29:55.212
Yeah, just stay like that.

29:57.314 --> 29:58.382
Yeah.

29:59.784 --> 30:01.553
Just like that.

30:03.822 --> 30:05.557
Yeah, just like that.

31:45.790 --> 31:48.626
More to the left.
That's it, that's it.

32:12.316 --> 32:13.517
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.487
This is her.

32:18.489 --> 32:20.190
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.002
I'm Bobby. Nice to meet you.

32:32.837 --> 32:34.204
Nice to meet you, too.

32:34.939 --> 32:36.106
Warm enough in here for you?

32:36.139 --> 32:37.709
I can turn the heat up
if you like.

32:38.710 --> 32:40.110
No, I'm good. Thank you.

32:40.143 --> 32:42.546
You good? Okay.

32:43.781 --> 32:46.149
Put your seatbelt on, please.

33:15.479 --> 33:16.681
You okay?

33:17.715 --> 33:19.182
Yeah. Yep.

33:21.251 --> 33:22.519
Almost there.

33:24.187 --> 33:26.423
I got a special spot I like.
It's coming.

33:27.992 --> 33:29.059
Okay?

33:29.426 --> 33:31.094
Okay.

34:26.050 --> 34:27.250
You want to get high?

34:28.753 --> 34:30.722
No, I'm good. Thank you.

34:30.755 --> 34:32.090
You mind if I do?

34:33.123 --> 34:35.092
- No, do your thing.
- Thank you.

34:41.065 --> 34:42.331
What's that?

34:44.301 --> 34:45.770
On your eye?

34:46.804 --> 34:48.106
Someone rough with you?

34:49.505 --> 34:50.641
Yeah.

34:51.576 --> 34:52.677
Sorry to hear that.

34:56.648 --> 34:58.281
I love this song.

36:17.294 --> 36:18.863
<i>Get up, K.O.!</i>

37:39.177 --> 37:40.611
Come on.

37:46.117 --> 37:47.151
It's okay.

37:58.029 --> 37:59.329
It's just water.

38:01.531 --> 38:02.633
Okay?

38:26.057 --> 38:28.559
Did you really think you could
trust a pimp and her whores?

38:32.163 --> 38:34.065
Corrupt ex-cop turned P.I.?

38:37.902 --> 38:39.203
You're smarter than that.

38:43.341 --> 38:44.374
She's gone.

38:45.910 --> 38:47.544
You're never gonna
see her again.

38:51.582 --> 38:54.051
Nobody's looking
because nobody cares.

38:59.891 --> 39:01.292
You can speak.

39:03.361 --> 39:04.427
Fuck you.

39:05.495 --> 39:06.564
It's okay.

39:18.709 --> 39:20.077
What's your mother's name?

39:22.046 --> 39:23.281
It's Jaya, right?

39:31.188 --> 39:32.556
Be back in a couple of hours.

41:19.397 --> 41:20.498
Fuck.

42:53.991 --> 42:56.293
- Hey, Dad.
- Where is he?

42:57.061 --> 42:58.129
In the basement.

43:40.471 --> 43:42.006
Find the girl first.

43:43.841 --> 43:45.743
Then come back
and take care of this.

43:59.523 --> 44:01.859
All right, she's been
on foot for about an hour or so.

44:01.892 --> 44:03.394
She can't have got
too far, okay?

44:03.794 --> 44:04.929
You head towards the river,

44:04.962 --> 44:06.463
and you head toward
the interstate,

44:06.497 --> 44:07.932
and then loop back around.

44:17.341 --> 44:19.276
You fucked this up!

44:19.310 --> 44:20.978
Kid, get up!
Get up!

44:21.011 --> 44:23.113
I'm always cleaning up
your shit!

44:23.147 --> 44:24.815
Now, get the fuck outta here!

44:24.848 --> 44:26.050
Go!

44:26.817 --> 44:27.885
Go!

46:06.517 --> 46:08.118
Fuck!

46:34.779 --> 46:35.913
Oh!

46:45.022 --> 46:46.323
I'm not hungry.

46:46.624 --> 46:47.726
Give it to Junior.

46:51.128 --> 46:52.196
Thanks, Mom.

47:03.742 --> 47:05.342
Thought you weren't
working overnight.

47:05.643 --> 47:06.778
Yeah, something came up.

47:07.579 --> 47:08.680
Thank you.

47:09.246 --> 47:12.049
Eww. Puddle of yolk.

47:23.595 --> 47:25.730
Okay, you finish those eggs
and be ready for school

47:25.764 --> 47:28.065
- in, like, 10 to 15.
- Okay, Dad.

47:28.867 --> 47:30.033
Good man.

49:18.943 --> 49:20.244
Junior, you ready?

50:58.308 --> 50:59.777
Little man.

50:59.978 --> 51:01.079
Hey.

51:03.246 --> 51:04.314
It's gonna be okay.

51:05.049 --> 51:06.084
Where is she?

51:15.258 --> 51:16.594
Where's my sister?

51:27.605 --> 51:29.473
Junior.

51:29.674 --> 51:32.076
Hey. Nothing's gonna happen...

51:32.110 --> 51:34.177
Fuck! Ahh!

51:35.680 --> 51:38.382
Fuck you!

51:56.533 --> 51:58.468
I'll cut this shit off if
you don't tell me somethin'.

52:02.472 --> 52:03.641
Did you hear me?

52:03.675 --> 52:05.409
I said I'll cut
her fuckin' ear off.

52:44.882 --> 52:46.450
You're gonna fuckin' talk.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.816
You gonna tell me somethin'?

53:41.538 --> 53:42.607
Talk!

54:16.073 --> 54:17.141
Where is she?

54:18.810 --> 54:20.211
You're never gonna find her.

55:12.129 --> 55:13.197
Shit.

55:14.497 --> 55:15.700
Oh, fuck.

57:58.462 --> 58:00.364
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

58:02.233 --> 58:03.667
You're gonna give me answers.

58:05.636 --> 58:07.038
And if you don't...

58:08.973 --> 58:10.041
I'm gonna hurt your son.

58:28.592 --> 58:30.094
Have you seen this girl before?

58:32.830 --> 58:35.266
- No.
- Don't fuckin' lie to me, really look.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.134
I haven't seen her before.

58:47.344 --> 58:48.412
Who's this?

58:49.346 --> 58:50.848
His father, Willie.

58:50.881 --> 58:52.083
What does he do?

58:54.618 --> 58:56.120
He's a businessman.

58:57.388 --> 58:59.090
He owns a bunch of land
along the lake.

59:03.294 --> 59:04.829
You know what this
piece of shit does, right?

59:10.234 --> 59:12.736
If I were you,
I'd walk away.

59:20.611 --> 59:21.912
He do that to you?

59:22.947 --> 59:24.081
What do you think?

01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:05.723
<i>Yo, man, what the fuck?</i>

01:00:05.756 --> 01:00:07.525
<i>I've been tryin' to
hit you up all day.</i>

01:00:07.559 --> 01:00:09.326
<i>Next batch is ready
to go out.</i>

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.061
<i>4:30 at The Yards.</i>

01:00:11.095 --> 01:00:12.696
<i>Hit me back, man.
Later.</i>

01:00:14.665 --> 01:00:16.066
What's The Yards?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.502
It's a train yard his father
owns near the lake.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:21.672
It's where they
send the girls north.

01:02:05.976 --> 01:02:07.077
Don't move.

01:02:07.646 --> 01:02:09.913
Go to the back.
Let's go.

01:02:14.285 --> 01:02:15.352
Keep goin'.

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:25.262
Open it.

01:02:31.135 --> 01:02:32.202
Come on.

01:02:43.648 --> 01:02:44.848
Where are they?

01:02:46.483 --> 01:02:47.619
The warehouse.

01:02:48.952 --> 01:02:50.622
Drop your phone
and give me your keys.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.123
Get in. Go.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.166
Keep goin'. Back.

01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:55.747
Weeta?

01:05:29.948 --> 01:05:31.649
What the fuck?
Who opened...

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:34.051
Fuck.

01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:36.019
Get outta here, girls. Go!

01:06:06.684 --> 01:06:07.752
Fuck!

01:06:17.227 --> 01:06:18.328
Oh, God.

01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:22.734
Turn over.

01:06:23.534 --> 01:06:25.068
I said turn over.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:33.343
Please. I'm sorry.

01:06:33.845 --> 01:06:35.212
Help me. Please.

01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.714
Tell me where my sister is.

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:41.084
Please.

01:06:43.888 --> 01:06:45.023
Please.

01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:49.059
Please.

01:06:49.192 --> 01:06:50.294
I'm sorry.

01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:52.362
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.968
Please.

01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:00.605
Don't leave me.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.943
Let me go. Please.

01:07:06.243 --> 01:07:07.477
I'm sorry.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.948
Please.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.228
Get up.

01:07:26.731 --> 01:07:28.900
Get up. You're taking me
to his father.

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:04.167
Is that it?

01:08:04.802 --> 01:08:06.604
- Yeah.
- Pull over here.

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:22.987
He got security?

01:08:24.287 --> 01:08:25.957
Just a guard at the front.

01:09:55.512 --> 01:09:57.380
All right. Come on.

01:10:32.216 --> 01:10:33.316
Where's Willie?

01:10:33.885 --> 01:10:35.753
He's in the library
having dinner.

01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:43.661
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

01:10:43.995 --> 01:10:45.096
Okay.

01:11:44.789 --> 01:11:46.224
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

01:12:00.238 --> 01:12:01.739
Look at me, Linda.

01:12:03.975 --> 01:12:05.209
You need to toughen up.

01:12:06.043 --> 01:12:09.213
You can't keep coming here
every time Bobby acts out.

01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:12.549
Remember.

01:12:13.217 --> 01:12:16.287
We accepted you into this family
as one of us.

01:12:19.156 --> 01:12:20.558
What is this?

01:13:02.266 --> 01:13:04.101
Junior.

01:13:04.402 --> 01:13:06.469
Junior. Junior!

01:13:13.577 --> 01:13:14.946
Turn around slowly.

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:39.003
Do you know who I am?

01:13:41.572 --> 01:13:42.640
Yes.

01:13:45.076 --> 01:13:46.444
You're looking for your sister.

01:13:49.413 --> 01:13:50.547
Where is she?

01:13:53.451 --> 01:13:54.517
Where's Weeta?

01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:01.625
You think I remember
their names?

01:14:06.964 --> 01:14:08.632
I killed your son,
motherfucker.

01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:11.235
Bobby's dead.

01:14:13.671 --> 01:14:14.905
Want to tell me somethin' now?

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:14.959
Five minute warning for K.O.

01:16:15.726 --> 01:16:18.028
- Mama K.O.
- Hey, Brick. How you doin'?

01:16:18.329 --> 01:16:19.830
Come on in.
She's back here.

01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:21.932
Bring your arm back.

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:23.033
Hold it.

01:16:28.506 --> 01:16:29.608
Hey, Ma.

01:16:31.142 --> 01:16:32.209
Hey.

01:16:36.514 --> 01:16:37.948
Thought you said
you weren't comin'.

01:16:41.018 --> 01:16:42.052
Changed my mind.

01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:46.591
It's your first fight
in a long time,

01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:47.992
you know, so...

01:16:50.027 --> 01:16:52.062
Well, thanks. For comin'.

01:16:54.431 --> 01:16:55.499
You're welcome.

01:16:57.501 --> 01:17:00.070
- Miss Uppeshau.
- Yeah.

01:17:00.104 --> 01:17:02.072
You know I hate doin' this,
but we gotta get ready.

01:17:02.439 --> 01:17:04.375
Right. I understand.

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:09.146
All right, look, focus.

01:17:09.313 --> 01:17:10.381
Focus up.

01:17:11.115 --> 01:17:12.216
This is your comeback.

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:13.585
Come on, let's go.

01:17:13.984 --> 01:17:16.020
Keep touchin'.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.489
Little touches.
Just get loose.

01:17:23.027 --> 01:17:24.528
Yep. Step back.

01:17:24.862 --> 01:17:26.363
Jab. One, two.

01:17:26.397 --> 01:17:27.698
One, two.

01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:29.200
Yeah.

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:31.168
Now go under. Yep.

01:17:31.468 --> 01:17:32.870
Yep. Ready?

01:17:32.903 --> 01:17:34.171
One, two, three. Under.

01:17:35.873 --> 01:17:38.475
Yep. Yep. Break.

01:17:38.509 --> 01:17:40.411
Double it.
