WEBVTT

00:20.292 --> 00:21.818
All right, Dad, spill it.

00:21.918 --> 00:23.275
What are we doing here?

00:23.375 --> 00:23.899
VICTOR:
What?

00:23.999 --> 00:25.899
Can't a father spend
a little quality time
with his daughter?

00:25.999 --> 00:27.899
Especially after
all the time
we've been apart?

00:27.999 --> 00:30.109
All right,
I take after you, okay?

00:30.209 --> 00:31.734
I've inherited
all your tricks,

00:31.834 --> 00:33.484
especially your fine art
of fibbing.

00:33.584 --> 00:36.150
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:36.250 --> 00:36.899
(<i>laughing</i>)

00:36.999 --> 00:39.899
Tell me a little bit more
about this Leo fellow anyway.

00:39.999 --> 00:40.899
How did he and Piper meet?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.484
Oh, it was a couple
of years ago at the house.

00:43.584 --> 00:45.234
He was our handyman.

00:45.334 --> 00:47.484
Piper's marrying
a handyman?

00:47.584 --> 00:50.899
Well, no, he isn't really
a handyman.

00:50.999 --> 00:51.692
Wait, you do know...

00:51.792 --> 00:53.150
All I know is he's
a nice enough guy

00:53.250 --> 00:54.942
who seems to know
the big bad secret.

00:55.042 --> 00:55.900
Trust me,
it's a lot better

00:56.000 --> 00:57.942
for a mortal to know
he's marrying a witch

00:58.042 --> 00:59.900
before the wedding
instead of after.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.899
Wish I'd had that.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.899
Mortal... right.

01:03.999 --> 01:06.899
(<i>loud banging</i>)

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
What?

01:11.417 --> 01:12.899
It's nothing.

01:12.999 --> 01:15.899
I guess that's why
they call it a ghost town, huh?

01:15.999 --> 01:16.776
What do you mean?

01:16.876 --> 01:18.109
Did you actually see something?

01:18.209 --> 01:19.692
What do <i>you</i> mean?

01:19.792 --> 01:22.918
I mean, like a premonition,
whatever you call it.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.359
All right, I confess.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.609
I... I brought you out here

01:25.709 --> 01:29.359
hoping maybe you could give me
a little bit of your help.

01:29.459 --> 01:31.192
I just didn't know how to ask.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.067
Magical help? Dad...

01:32.167 --> 01:33.317
Well, this place
seemed like

01:33.417 --> 01:34.651
such a good investment.

01:34.751 --> 01:35.245
Too good, actually.

01:35.255 --> 01:37.818
Made me think that
all the stories were true.

01:37.918 --> 01:39.859
I'm biting: what stories?

01:39.959 --> 01:41.526
Ghost stories.

01:41.626 --> 01:42.776
Something's been
keeping people

01:42.876 --> 01:45.900
from investing and razing
this place for over 100 years.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.192
So what: You want me to do a
little supernatural inspection?

01:49.292 --> 01:50.204
Well, yeah,
I thought you could do

01:50.214 --> 01:51.037
a little feng shui on the place

01:51.047 --> 01:52.609
and maybe see
if there's anything

01:52.709 --> 01:53.150
going on.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.484
Okay, first of all,
I don't do feng shui.

01:55.584 --> 01:58.734
And secondly, I can't always get
a premonition when I want to.

01:58.834 --> 02:00.025
(<i>distant voices</i>)

02:00.125 --> 02:02.899
Okay, now I definitely
heard that.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.109
Heard what?

02:04.209 --> 02:06.792
(<i>metallic clanging
 and glass breaking</i>)

02:07.417 --> 02:09.999
Okay, you didn't
hear that?

02:12.626 --> 02:14.899
You're a dead man, Bo.

02:14.999 --> 02:16.083
Can you see them?

02:17.542 --> 02:18.709
See who?

02:19.999 --> 02:20.899
PHOEBE:
Hey...

02:20.999 --> 02:21.899
hey! What's going on?

02:21.999 --> 02:24.067
Nobody crosses Mr. Sutter.

02:24.167 --> 02:25.667
(<i>grunting</i>)

02:30.876 --> 02:31.900
Whoo-hoo!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.692
Run, Geronimo!
(<i>gunshot</i>)

02:33.792 --> 02:34.818
(<i>gasping</i>)
Phoebe!

02:34.918 --> 02:36.275
(<i>gunshot</i>)

02:36.375 --> 02:38.109
Phoebe, what's going on?

02:38.209 --> 02:39.692
Sweetheart,

02:39.792 --> 02:41.167
you're bleeding.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.899
I wouldn't buy the place,
Dad.

02:44.999 --> 02:48.626
Really, really bad feng shui.

03:59.375 --> 04:01.609
Uh, wait a minute.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.067
We have one too many
place settings.

04:03.167 --> 04:04.609
No, we don't.

04:04.709 --> 04:10.359
Okay, uh... you, me, Leo,
Phoebe, Dad.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.359
That's five.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.651
We have six.

04:12.751 --> 04:13.442
So?

04:13.542 --> 04:15.900
So who is
the sixth for?

04:16.000 --> 04:21.442
Mmm, maybe, um... Mom.

04:21.541 --> 04:22.609
What, it's... it's my wedding!

04:22.709 --> 04:26.234
At least she can be here
in spirit, if nothing else.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.292
Yes, she can be.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.359
Wow, looks great.
When do we eat?

04:31.459 --> 04:34.234
Leo, can't you see
we're having
a sister moment?

04:34.334 --> 04:36.275
Oh sorry.
Do you want me to go?

04:36.375 --> 04:37.109
No, I want you to help.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.234
This is your rehearsal
dinner, too, you know.

04:39.334 --> 04:40.692
PRUE:
So, Leo,

04:40.792 --> 04:41.651
you nervous?

04:41.751 --> 04:42.899
I mean only one more week
before...

04:42.999 --> 04:44.734
(<i>humming "The Wedding March"</i>)

04:44.834 --> 04:45.621
Uh, well, as long
as no demons

04:45.631 --> 04:48.275
come bursting through that door
until then, I'm fine.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.292
VICTOR:
Prue? Piper?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.025
You had to jinx it.

04:54.125 --> 04:57.025
Hey...

04:57.125 --> 04:58.025
Phoebe, what happened?

04:58.125 --> 05:00.067
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm fine.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.484
I just need an aspirin.

05:01.584 --> 05:02.526
Dad...

05:02.626 --> 05:03.359
I don't know what happened.

05:03.459 --> 05:04.370
One minute we were
just walking around.

05:04.380 --> 05:06.042
The next thing I know
she's bleeding.

05:06.292 --> 05:07.442
I got into a bar brawl.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.567
Well, actually,

05:08.667 --> 05:09.899
I didn't; two cowboys did.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.899
Bo and some other guy,
I didn't catch his name.

05:11.999 --> 05:12.734
But I think he's the bad guy

05:12.834 --> 05:14.275
'cause he was wearing
the black hat.

05:14.375 --> 05:14.734
Oh...

05:14.834 --> 05:16.667
and they were transparent.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.484
She must have hit her head.

05:18.584 --> 05:19.442
PHOEBE:
Uh-huh.

05:19.542 --> 05:19.994
Sweetheart, I never

05:20.004 --> 05:21.734
would have taken you there
if I had any idea.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.818
It's fine, Dad, really.
Don't worry about it.

05:23.918 --> 05:25.275
Here, let me take care
of that.

05:25.375 --> 05:25.899
No...

05:25.999 --> 05:27.275
I'm all right.

05:27.375 --> 05:27.899
Um... Dad...

05:27.999 --> 05:29.899
why don't you go to the porch

05:29.999 --> 05:30.899
and get those town files?

05:30.999 --> 05:34.484
You know, maybe there's
something in them that
could actually help us.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.417
All right.

05:40.999 --> 05:43.900
Dad doesn't know that Leo
is a whitelighter!

05:44.000 --> 05:44.651
What?
What?

05:44.751 --> 05:47.692
Well, I've been meaning
to tell him,

05:47.792 --> 05:48.776
but considering
Mom had

05:48.876 --> 05:50.234
an affair with her whitelighter,

05:50.334 --> 05:52.567
I didn't think he'd really be
receptive to the idea.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.359
Piper, he's gonna kill me
when he finds out.

05:55.459 --> 05:56.818
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

05:56.918 --> 05:58.417
You're already dead.

05:59.334 --> 06:01.442
Just a lot of investment stuff.
Background info.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.025
I don't see how it's gonna help
you find out what happened.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.899
Well, you're the one
that called it a ghost town.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.818
And since Bo fell through me
and I ended up

06:09.918 --> 06:12.609
with the same split lip
that he had.

06:12.709 --> 06:13.899
Sounds like a ghost to me.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.942
It can't be.
Ghosts don't bleed.

06:16.042 --> 06:16.651
(<i>grunts</i>)

06:16.751 --> 06:18.692
I mean, so I've read
in books.

06:18.792 --> 06:19.401
(<i>chuckles</i>)

06:19.501 --> 06:20.067
Obviously it's not

06:20.167 --> 06:21.192
my area of expertise.

06:21.292 --> 06:22.751
(<i>chuckles</i>)

06:23.042 --> 06:23.567
Mine, either.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.526
What do you say
we let the supernatural stuff

06:26.626 --> 06:28.567
to the pros and go grab a bite?

06:28.667 --> 06:30.734
I don't know,
Mr. Bennett.

06:30.834 --> 06:31.692
Oh...

06:31.792 --> 06:33.734
"Victor," please. It's time
you call me Victor, son.

06:33.834 --> 06:34.484
Come on.

06:34.584 --> 06:35.899
I'm fine.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.526
Go ahead.

06:37.626 --> 06:40.192
(<i>Prue chuckles</i>)

06:40.292 --> 06:41.899
Great, now I'm dead.

06:41.999 --> 06:44.442
All right, why don't we
just focus on Phoebe

06:44.542 --> 06:46.401
and try to figure out
what happened?

06:46.501 --> 06:47.484
I'll get the book.

06:47.584 --> 06:48.025
I'll get it.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.999
Maybe a drink.

06:51.584 --> 06:52.067
Ow!

06:52.167 --> 06:55.359
So, Phoebe says
you're a handyman.

06:55.459 --> 06:59.401
Oh? Uh, actually, no,
I'm, uh, I'm a doctor.

06:59.501 --> 07:01.567
I mean, not a doctor
doctor per se.

07:01.667 --> 07:02.120
More of like

07:02.130 --> 07:04.526
a counselor doctor.
I guide people.

07:04.626 --> 07:05.567
You make good money?

07:05.667 --> 07:07.651
Uh, honestly, no.

07:07.751 --> 07:08.942
It's more of a calling.

07:09.042 --> 07:10.417
Mm.

07:10.959 --> 07:13.609
Leo, I think
it's time to come clean.

07:13.709 --> 07:14.359
You do?

07:14.459 --> 07:18.150
Yeah. I need to talk to you
about something man-to-man.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.234
Man to man?

07:19.334 --> 07:22.401
Well, from one mortal
to another.

07:22.501 --> 07:23.442
Leo,

07:23.542 --> 07:26.983
it's not easy
being married to a witch.

07:27.083 --> 07:27.442
No.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.317
That's why my marriage
to Piper's mother

07:29.417 --> 07:29.899
didn't work out.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.899
It wasn't because
I didn't love her.

07:31.999 --> 07:34.442
It's because I wasn't prepared
for what was to come.

07:34.542 --> 07:38.776
Well, I think I'm prepared, sir.
I mean, Victor.

07:38.876 --> 07:39.621
Oh, don't get me wrong, Leo.

07:39.631 --> 07:42.526
I want this marriage to succeed.
That's why I'm warning you.

07:42.626 --> 07:44.899
But there are dangers
out there

07:44.999 --> 07:46.818
worse than demons and warlocks.

07:46.918 --> 07:49.067
You do know about them,
don't you?

07:49.167 --> 07:49.899
Well, yeah, sure.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.317
Well, the dangers
I'm talking about

07:51.417 --> 07:53.484
you're not even gonna see
coming.

07:53.584 --> 07:56.442
The thing I'm talking about
will just sneak up on you

07:56.542 --> 08:00.526
and destroy your marriage
if you're not careful.

08:00.626 --> 08:01.109
Leo,

08:01.209 --> 08:04.542
do you know what
a whitelighter is?

08:06.751 --> 08:09.125
Uh...

08:12.999 --> 08:13.900
Whoa!

08:14.000 --> 08:14.734
What?

08:14.834 --> 08:16.983
Look, I have a huge bruise.

08:17.083 --> 08:17.942
Oh.

08:18.042 --> 08:19.234
Ow!

08:19.334 --> 08:20.317
All right.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.859
Well, you must have
gotten that the same way

08:22.959 --> 08:24.899
that you got the split lip
from Bo.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.484
I don't get it.

08:25.584 --> 08:28.192
He gets beat up
and I get his symptoms?

08:28.292 --> 08:28.904
How is that possible?

08:29.004 --> 08:30.859
I wish I knew what
I was looking for.

08:30.959 --> 08:34.109
I mean, if they're not ghosts,
then what are they?

08:34.208 --> 08:34.859
Well, whatever it is,

08:34.958 --> 08:36.775
it's got something to do
with the history of that town.

08:36.876 --> 08:38.899
You said that they were dressed
like cowboys, right?

08:38.999 --> 08:41.899
Yeah. Real cowboys,
right out of the Old West.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.317
The outlaw said
something

08:43.417 --> 08:45.899
to Bo about a guy named Sutter.
Look him up.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.567
Maybe he's a demon.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.401
Wait a minute.

08:48.501 --> 08:49.899
Did you find something?

08:49.999 --> 08:51.567
It's more of what
I'm not finding.

08:51.667 --> 08:55.317
All right, nothing is dated past
April 25, 1873.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.359
The, the maps,
the land grants,

08:57.459 --> 08:58.072
death certificates,

08:58.172 --> 09:00.275
It's almost like time
just stopped.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.567
What do you mean stopped?

09:01.667 --> 09:02.526
Like everybody just died?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.899
No, like stopped moving forward,
literally.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.484
It wouldn't be the first time
we've come across a time loop.

09:07.584 --> 09:09.609
Nah, we vanquished
that demon.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.959
Wait a minute.

09:12.999 --> 09:14.442
Well, maybe it's not a demon.

09:14.542 --> 09:14.995
Maybe it's a curse.

09:15.005 --> 09:18.899
"Certain spiritual traditions
believe that a great evil

09:18.999 --> 09:21.150
"or a great injustice
can be cursed

09:21.250 --> 09:23.567
into a time loop until righted."

09:23.667 --> 09:27.899
So that's probably why
this is happening to me.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.942
Our job is to right the wrong.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.401
Yeah, well, we better do it

09:31.501 --> 09:33.734
before your symptoms
get any worse.

09:33.834 --> 09:34.899
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

09:34.999 --> 09:37.250
I'll get that.

09:41.584 --> 09:43.484
Hey, Prue, long time.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.209
Is Phoebe home?

09:46.918 --> 09:47.899
What the...?

09:47.999 --> 09:49.025
PHOEBE:
Cole?! What?!

09:49.125 --> 09:50.899
Phoebe, hi.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.734
Oh, whoo.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.275
These are for you.

09:54.375 --> 09:55.359
What the hell

09:55.459 --> 09:55.994
are you doing here?

09:56.004 --> 09:56.983
Do you have some kind
of a death wish?

09:57.083 --> 09:58.526
Well, I told Phoebe last week

09:58.626 --> 09:59.899
I wasn't giving up on her,

09:59.999 --> 10:00.899
and I-I meant it.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.692
PIPER:
You talked to Phoebe?

10:02.792 --> 10:03.818
He talked to you?

10:03.918 --> 10:04.401
Uh-huh.

10:04.501 --> 10:05.692
You said
that he was alive.

10:05.792 --> 10:07.484
You never said
that he was back.

10:07.584 --> 10:08.818
It didn't matter.

10:08.918 --> 10:09.900
Because as I told him,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.150
I don't want anything
to do with him anymore.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.900
Oh, well, in that case...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:15.000 --> 10:15.776
I just set that table.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.899
We don't have time
to buy a new one
before dinner.

10:17.999 --> 10:20.067
I'm not gonna use my powers
against you anyway.

10:20.167 --> 10:23.609
In fact, I'm never gonna use
them again,

10:23.709 --> 10:24.899
ever.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.067
Keeps me from being evil.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.442
No, you will
always be evil.
You're a demon.

10:28.542 --> 10:33.083
Half demon. My human half can
suppress it if...

10:33.667 --> 10:34.609
Phoebe, you're hurt.

10:34.709 --> 10:35.899
What happened?
You know what, Cole?

10:35.999 --> 10:37.918
It's none of your business.

10:38.042 --> 10:39.899
So why don't you do yourself

10:39.999 --> 10:41.526
a favor and just get...

10:41.626 --> 10:42.317
(<i>gunshot</i>)

10:42.417 --> 10:43.942
(<i>grunts</i>)

10:44.042 --> 10:46.292
(<i>gasps</i>)

10:48.501 --> 10:49.542
Phoebe?

10:49.999 --> 10:51.542
(<i>gasps</i>)

10:54.209 --> 10:55.584
Phoebe, what happened?

10:57.876 --> 11:01.626
I think... I've been shot!

11:09.459 --> 11:11.192
The thing is,
they can warp into

11:11.292 --> 11:14.317
their charges lives any
time of the day or night...

11:14.417 --> 11:15.959
Refill?

11:16.999 --> 11:19.859
...without us mortals
even knowing about it.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.859
You can't trust the
whitelighters, Leo.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.692
They're sneaky
little bastards.

11:23.792 --> 11:24.983
Really?

11:25.083 --> 11:25.818
Look, Piper says that

11:25.918 --> 11:27.275
they're really,
really good guys,

11:27.375 --> 11:28.359
more of, like,
guardian angels.

11:28.459 --> 11:31.859
That's the party line, Leo,
but don't believe it.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.899
You can't trust 'em.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.150
They have this tendency

11:34.250 --> 11:35.651
to fall in love
with their charges.

11:35.751 --> 11:38.442
Before you know it,
they've stolen your wife.

11:38.542 --> 11:39.899
The girls' mother, Patty,

11:39.999 --> 11:41.192
she fell for her whitelighter.

11:41.292 --> 11:43.609
Oh, I thought that happened
after you two separated.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.275
Oh, he was putting
the moves on her

11:45.375 --> 11:47.999
long before
we split up, believe me.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.899
And, you know,
we never had a chance

11:49.999 --> 11:52.401
to get back together
because of him, and, um...

11:52.501 --> 11:55.999
you know, then she died.

11:58.167 --> 11:58.859
Look,

11:58.959 --> 12:01.918
my point is,
if you want to...

12:03.000 --> 12:03.900
Uh-oh.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.125
What?

12:05.542 --> 12:08.818
Uh.... I have to go. Now.

12:08.918 --> 12:09.567
Go?
Yeah...

12:09.667 --> 12:11.651
and I don't think
you're gonna like

12:11.751 --> 12:13.999
the way I have to go, either.

12:24.999 --> 12:26.609
What the hell are
you doing here?

12:26.709 --> 12:27.900
PRUE:
Forget about him, Leo.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.025
Phoebe's been shot.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.275
Shot? How did that happen?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.899
There's no time
to explain.

12:31.999 --> 12:33.375
Can you heal her?

12:36.751 --> 12:37.776
Where's Dad?

12:37.876 --> 12:39.626
Seething, probably.

12:42.876 --> 12:45.192
What's the matter, Leo?
Why isn't it working?

12:45.292 --> 12:46.109
I don't know.

12:46.209 --> 12:49.150
Phoebe, you gotta tell me
exactly how this happened.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.983
Uh... I don't....

12:52.083 --> 12:53.776
I don't really know.

12:53.876 --> 12:58.275
I had a... a premonition and...

12:58.375 --> 12:59.526
I <i>felt</i>

12:59.626 --> 13:01.526
Bo get shot and then

13:01.626 --> 13:02.942
I came out of it.

13:03.042 --> 13:03.899
Leo, can you heal her?

13:03.999 --> 13:07.899
No. Because Phoebe wasn't
the one that was shot. Bo was.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.899
PIPER:
What are you
talking about?

13:09.999 --> 13:10.496
She's bleeding.

13:10.506 --> 13:13.192
LEO:
I know, but it's more
like a psychic echo.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.120
Phoebe is linked to Bo somehow.

13:14.130 --> 13:16.983
Whatever he feels, whatever
happens to him, happens to her.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.900
COLE:
Which means Bo must
be magical, too.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.709
They only way they can be linked
is through their magic.

13:23.459 --> 13:24.275
I agree.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.484
We have to find Bo. Heal <i>him.</i>

13:26.584 --> 13:27.899
It's the only way.

13:27.999 --> 13:29.899
Well, he's been cursed
into a time loop,

13:29.999 --> 13:31.109
along with the rest of the town,

13:31.209 --> 13:33.401
and we don't know
how to get there,

13:33.501 --> 13:34.899
let alone where "there" is.

13:34.999 --> 13:36.275
Well, it's gotta be
a parallel plane

13:36.375 --> 13:37.818
existing in the same
physical space

13:37.918 --> 13:39.359
as the town.
You know, I
don't think

13:39.459 --> 13:42.459
that we need
any demonic input right now.

13:43.626 --> 13:46.626
If I can help
save Phoebe's life...

13:47.042 --> 13:49.125
...you sure as hell do.

13:49.792 --> 13:50.942
We're listening.

13:51.042 --> 13:51.609
Look, I move

13:51.709 --> 13:52.899
through different
planes all the time.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.275
It's how I've been
hiding from the Source.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.899
It shouldn't be any
problem to shimmer into

13:55.999 --> 13:58.899
Bo's plane, bring him back
here so you can heal him.

13:58.999 --> 13:59.401
You said

13:59.501 --> 14:01.109
you don't use
your powers anymore.

14:01.209 --> 14:04.167
Shimmering isn't a lethal power.

14:04.334 --> 14:07.609
Why don't you just
take Leo with you

14:07.709 --> 14:10.025
and you can heal Bo there?

14:10.125 --> 14:10.899
LEO:
I can't.

14:10.999 --> 14:13.292
I'm not allowed
to work with a demon.

14:14.042 --> 14:15.317
Fine. I'll go.

14:15.417 --> 14:16.109
Prue.

14:16.209 --> 14:17.734
I'm not gonna
leave this up to him.

14:17.834 --> 14:18.899
PIPER:
Well, okay,

14:18.999 --> 14:19.900
what if something goes wrong

14:20.000 --> 14:21.442
and you get stuck
in the time loop

14:21.542 --> 14:23.025
and you don't get back
before midnight?

14:23.125 --> 14:25.899
It's not the time loop
I'm worried about.

14:25.999 --> 14:26.942
Look, why don't
you and Leo

14:27.042 --> 14:29.899
go to the town and see if
you can find anything there

14:29.999 --> 14:31.734
to help break the curse.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.899
You, you hang in there, okay?

14:33.999 --> 14:38.083
Play nice, you two.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.899
Gotta hold my hand.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.959
This already sucks.

14:45.876 --> 14:46.859
(<i>door slams</i>)

14:46.959 --> 14:47.401
VICTOR:
Leo!

14:47.501 --> 14:48.899
You lying little

14:48.999 --> 14:50.359
piece of...
Okay! Dad!

14:50.459 --> 14:51.150
Not now.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.275
Stay with Phoebe.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.209
We'll be back.

14:57.209 --> 14:58.317
(<i>stammers</i>)

14:58.417 --> 15:02.459
Well, don't get mad at me.
I've been shot.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.692
Oh, wow.

15:07.792 --> 15:08.899
It worked.

15:08.999 --> 15:09.370
You doubted me?

15:09.380 --> 15:11.899
Yeah, well, for all I knew
you were gonna...

15:11.999 --> 15:12.899
(<i>cawing</i>)

15:12.999 --> 15:15.192
(<i>shrieks</i>)

15:15.292 --> 15:15.983
Okay.

15:16.083 --> 15:16.900
(<i>panting</i>)

15:17.000 --> 15:18.899
Welcome to the Wild,
Wild West.

15:18.999 --> 15:22.275
All right, just,
just so we're clear.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.609
I'm in charge here.
You're just my ride.

15:24.709 --> 15:25.899
Fine with me.

15:25.999 --> 15:26.899
What's your plan?

15:26.999 --> 15:28.192
Find Bo, lay low.

15:28.292 --> 15:29.609
That's a plan?

15:29.709 --> 15:31.776
Yeah. You got
a better one?

15:31.876 --> 15:32.692
Maybe,

15:32.792 --> 15:34.899
but... first I think
we better find something

15:34.999 --> 15:38.275
a little less
conspicuous to wear.

15:38.375 --> 15:41.899
Fine. Agreed.
Any ideas?

15:41.999 --> 15:43.192
MAN:
Okay.

15:43.292 --> 15:44.234
Look out.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.150
Make room.

15:45.250 --> 15:49.292
Yeah. Nothing you're
gonna like, though.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
GAMBLER:
I'll raise you a dollar.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.526
I still think you
should have worn

15:58.626 --> 16:01.025
that pretty little red
dress drying on the line.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.484
Yeah, that was a
prostitute's dress,

16:02.584 --> 16:04.899
not exactly the kind of
impression I wanted to make.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.899
At least I'm not wearing
some dead guy's clothes.

16:06.999 --> 16:07.746
I thought you'd be pleased.

16:07.756 --> 16:09.899
At least I'm playing
the role of a good guy.

16:09.999 --> 16:10.454
Yeah, right.

16:10.464 --> 16:13.292
Just fact-finding, okay?
No getting involved.

16:15.959 --> 16:16.899
What'll it be?

16:16.999 --> 16:18.109
Hi. Moonshine.

16:18.209 --> 16:18.942
A what?

16:19.042 --> 16:19.899
She means, uh...

16:19.999 --> 16:21.983
whiskey. Make it two.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.150
Leave the bottle.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.859
You watch too many
old movies.

16:24.959 --> 16:27.484
And you'd be confusing
me with Phoebe.

16:27.584 --> 16:29.818
Mm-mm. Not a chance.

16:29.918 --> 16:31.125
Passing through?

16:32.042 --> 16:32.484
Maybe.

16:32.584 --> 16:36.192
Maybe if you're not,
you ought to consider it.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.942
Things are getting pretty
dangerous around here.

16:39.042 --> 16:40.983
Friendly advice.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.899
Wet your whistle,
get back on your horses

16:43.999 --> 16:46.609
and move on as fast as you can.

16:46.709 --> 16:47.899
Hi.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.609
What am I, a potted plant?

16:50.709 --> 16:51.899
Talk to me.
What's so dangerous?

16:51.999 --> 16:55.526
It's nothing to concern your
pretty little head about.

16:55.626 --> 16:57.899
Okay, now, that's
condescending.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.150
Lay low,
remember?

16:59.250 --> 16:59.942
Fine.

17:00.042 --> 17:00.899
You were saying?

17:00.999 --> 17:02.150
There's some trouble

17:02.250 --> 17:04.898
between a powerful
man in town...

17:04.999 --> 17:05.776
Sutter?

17:05.876 --> 17:07.275
How do you know about Sutter?

17:07.375 --> 17:09.233
This pretty little
head knows a lot.

17:09.334 --> 17:12.526
So why don't you talk
to both of us now?

17:12.626 --> 17:13.442
Tell us what's going on.

17:13.541 --> 17:14.898
GAMBLER:
All right, I'll raise.

17:14.999 --> 17:18.442
One of Sutter's men
just got killed,

17:18.541 --> 17:21.791
and now there's going
to be hell to pay.

18:08.792 --> 18:10.999
Where is he?

18:11.501 --> 18:13.150
Just so you know,
I've already

18:13.250 --> 18:14.692
taken the liberty

18:14.792 --> 18:17.651
to print up the evening edition,

18:17.751 --> 18:20.234
just so you know
how serious this is.

18:20.334 --> 18:24.459
All the news
that's fit to print.

18:33.292 --> 18:36.526
You know where your little
brother's hiding out, don't you?

18:36.626 --> 18:39.709
Even if I did,
I'd never tell <i>you.</i>

18:41.167 --> 18:44.417
I'm not afraid
of you, Mr. Sutter.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.275
Well, if you were
smart, you'd be.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.692
Of course...

18:48.792 --> 18:51.542
your kind are not, are they?

18:52.292 --> 18:52.983
Hold it.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.999
The plan is to
not get involved.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.942
I-I-I haven't seen
Bo, Mr. Sutter.

19:00.042 --> 19:02.876
I swear. Not since
he took off.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.234
You know, you lie
to me again, Cal,

19:13.334 --> 19:15.999
and I'll do worse than this.

19:23.417 --> 19:24.037
PRUE:
What the hell

19:24.047 --> 19:25.150
is wrong with you people?

19:25.250 --> 19:27.150
Well, well, well.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.942
What have we got here.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.626
Uh... Prue?

19:32.125 --> 19:34.109
Lady, I don't know who you are,

19:34.209 --> 19:35.899
or where you come from...

19:35.999 --> 19:36.899
(<i>moaning</i>)

19:36.999 --> 19:37.899
but you obviously don't have

19:37.999 --> 19:40.150
the slightest idea
who you're dealing with.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.709
Oh, please, what a clichÃ©.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.484
I usually
don't hit women,

19:48.584 --> 19:50.776
but seeing as you're
dressed like a man,

19:50.876 --> 19:53.334
I imagine I can
make an exception.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.526
Don't.

20:01.626 --> 20:01.983
SUTTER:
No.

20:02.083 --> 20:05.083
Deal with these two later.

20:05.918 --> 20:07.876
After we take care of Bo.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.567
This ain't over.

20:14.667 --> 20:15.899
You and me,

20:15.999 --> 20:19.375
we have a score to settle.

20:24.999 --> 20:28.876
One of you know
where he's at.

20:32.626 --> 20:33.900
And if you don't tell me,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.876
I'm gonna burn this town
to the ground looking for him.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.359
So much for
laying low.

20:47.459 --> 20:48.999
Yeah.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.025
Sutter's in tight
with the railroads.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.526
He came here a
couple of months ago

20:56.626 --> 20:57.900
promising to bring
the tracks through

20:58.000 --> 21:00.442
and make it more than
just an old mining town.

21:00.542 --> 21:01.692
In exchange for what?

21:01.792 --> 21:02.899
A piece of everything:

21:02.999 --> 21:04.442
mines, the bank,
the newspaper.

21:04.542 --> 21:06.192
When folks started
resisting,

21:06.292 --> 21:06.900
his boys took over.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.859
First everybody
stood up to them,

21:08.959 --> 21:11.317
but after they
killed the sheriff...

21:11.417 --> 21:11.899
Cowards.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.899
Why is Sutter
after your brother?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.734
Because Bo wouldn't
back down.

21:15.834 --> 21:16.204
He kept on fighting,

21:16.214 --> 21:18.692
trying to get everybody
to take back the town.

21:18.792 --> 21:19.899
He sounds like a brave man.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.734
He is. Too bad
the others aren't.

21:21.834 --> 21:22.999
Isabel.

21:23.626 --> 21:24.734
We know that Bo is injured.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.626
We know that he's been shot.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.417
We can help you,
but you have to trust us.

21:30.209 --> 21:31.999
I do.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.542
Bo said you'd come.

21:38.584 --> 21:39.484
How's that again?

21:39.584 --> 21:41.692
Bo. He saw it in
one of his dreams.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.442
He said that two
strangers would come,

21:44.542 --> 21:47.109
so... um... I knew.

21:47.209 --> 21:48.567
All right,
so wait a second.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.776
Bo has dreams
about the future?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.818
Yeah. He has the gift.

21:52.918 --> 21:54.150
He inherited it
from our father,

21:54.250 --> 21:57.776
who was a great medicine man.
His name was Soaring Crow.

21:57.876 --> 21:58.526
Was?

21:58.626 --> 21:59.370
He died when we were young.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.150
When we moved here,
my mother wouldn't allow Bo

22:02.250 --> 22:02.942
to talk about his gift.

22:03.042 --> 22:05.609
She knew that magic
was considered evil

22:05.709 --> 22:06.983
in the white man's world.

22:07.083 --> 22:07.899
Yeah, I know
what it's like

22:07.999 --> 22:10.234
to have a gift that
you have to keep a secret.

22:10.334 --> 22:11.734
Yeah, and live
in a place where

22:11.834 --> 22:13.692
you have to hide
half of who you are.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.109
Come. I'll take you to Bo.

22:16.209 --> 22:16.942
Come.

22:17.042 --> 22:18.609
Where did you
get the horses?

22:18.709 --> 22:21.125
I told you. I was
expecting you.

Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

22:28.751 --> 22:32.359
You know, I still say we
eliminate the threat first.

22:32.459 --> 22:33.234
Kill Sutter.

22:33.334 --> 22:35.734
Probably break the curse anyway.

22:35.834 --> 22:36.899
Yeah, well,
we don't know that,

22:36.999 --> 22:38.942
which is why we need
to get to Bo first.

22:39.042 --> 22:40.317
You know, Cole,
if you want

22:40.417 --> 22:41.900
to try your hand at being good,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.292
your first instinct
shouldn't be to kill.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.359
(<i>cawing</i>)

23:05.459 --> 23:05.899
I don't know

23:05.999 --> 23:08.818
what we're supposed
to be looking for.
Yuck!

23:08.918 --> 23:09.746
Well, we gotta
keep looking,

23:09.756 --> 23:12.192
find something
that might help us
break the curse.

23:12.292 --> 23:12.734
Like what?

23:12.834 --> 23:15.234
There's nothing here
but spiders and lizards

23:15.334 --> 23:17.025
and that stupid
old crow.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.899
Oh, come on.
Let's keep looking.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.899
After all, we've got a rehearsal
dinner to get back to.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.942
There's not gonna be
a rehearsal dinner
or a wedding

23:24.042 --> 23:26.501
if we don't find
a way to save Phoebe.

23:28.999 --> 23:29.442
What is it?

23:29.542 --> 23:33.025
Phoebe said Bo got
in a fight in the bar, right?

23:33.125 --> 23:34.651
So that would be the saloon.

23:34.751 --> 23:36.192
Makes sense. It's a Western.

23:36.292 --> 23:39.651
So it's always the saloon.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.734
that they don't have
until midnight.

24:25.834 --> 24:28.959
Which means neither does Phoebe.

24:37.999 --> 24:40.584
Here you go.
Drink up.

deep inside of you.

I...

25:32.834 --> 25:36.375
I can't explain it.

25:37.626 --> 25:39.899
Your sisters are not
gonna let that happen.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
I am not gonna let that happen.

How is she?

25:49.083 --> 25:51.542
She's gonna be fine.

Okay, we have
to hurry.

25:53.626 --> 25:54.900

Bo dies at sundown.

Except I don't think
Prue knows that.

But we have an idea
how to let her know.

25:58.501 --> 26:00.025
Phoebe, if you're getting

maybe you he can get one
from you.

26:01.918 --> 26:03.484
I don't understand.

26:03.584 --> 26:05.192
Phoebe, if you can
will yourself

26:05.292 --> 26:07.651
to get a premonition
about Bo's death,

26:07.751 --> 26:09.109
he might be able
to see it, too.

26:09.209 --> 26:10.899
And then he can
tell Prue and Cole

26:10.999 --> 26:12.359
that they don't have
as much time

26:12.459 --> 26:13.899
as they think they do.

26:13.999 --> 26:16.734
But I thought you said you
couldn't always get premonitions

26:16.834 --> 26:17.899
when you wanted.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.899
I can't.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
You can try.

26:37.751 --> 26:39.275
Any idea what
we should say to him?

26:39.375 --> 26:41.526
We are not gonna say anything.

26:41.626 --> 26:42.859
I'll do the talking.

You know, it wouldn't kill you
to be nice to me.

26:46.959 --> 26:47.859
Really?

26:47.959 --> 26:48.899
It's funny that
you should say that

considering how many times
you actually tried to kill me.

26:52.626 --> 26:54.275
That's all in the past, Prue.

26:54.375 --> 26:55.275
(<i>chuckles</i>)

26:55.375 --> 26:55.859
Right.

26:55.959 --> 26:57.899
After all this
is done,

26:57.999 --> 26:59.859
you need to leave us alone.

26:59.959 --> 27:00.899
Otherwise,
we'll have to do

27:00.999 --> 27:02.899
to you what we should have done
in the first place,

27:02.999 --> 27:03.899
which is vanquish you.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.776
Then that's what
you're gonna have to do

27:05.876 --> 27:10.792
because it's the only way you're
gonna keep me away from Phoebe.

27:12.334 --> 27:15.317
Are you guys
ready to go in?

27:15.417 --> 27:18.442
Uh... something wrong?

No, nothing
that I can't handle.

They've come to help.

27:59.292 --> 28:02.334
Just like in your vision,
remember?

28:02.542 --> 28:05.083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:05.999 --> 28:07.109
Bo, I told them.

28:07.209 --> 28:09.983
Too much, apparently.

28:10.083 --> 28:12.401
We don't need your help.

28:12.501 --> 28:13.942
Just leave now.

28:14.042 --> 28:15.899
Bo, my sister gets visions, too.

28:15.999 --> 28:18.192
And she had one of you getting
shot, all right?

28:18.292 --> 28:19.776
We're here to help you.

28:19.876 --> 28:21.125
And help her.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.359
It's a trick.

28:23.459 --> 28:24.899
Sutter sent you!

28:24.999 --> 28:25.899
I know he did!

28:25.999 --> 28:28.375
No! They stood up to Sutter.

28:28.709 --> 28:30.584
You should have seen it.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.250
Just get out of here!

28:33.999 --> 28:35.734
We're not going anywhere.

28:35.834 --> 28:37.317
I know that look.

28:37.417 --> 28:40.042
Sutter's got it, too.

You're evil!

28:41.999 --> 28:43.567
I can sense it.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.401
All right, then just

28:45.501 --> 28:47.792
look at me.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.899
You can't say the same thing
about me, can you?

28:50.999 --> 28:53.899
Bo, this isn't just
about you, all right?

28:53.999 --> 28:56.692
My sister will die, too;
this whole town will

28:56.792 --> 28:58.375
if you don't let us help you.

28:58.999 --> 29:01.818
They think that something
Sutter is going to do to you

29:01.918 --> 29:02.579
will trigger a curse--

29:02.589 --> 29:06.667
the kind that father
used to speak about.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.818
If we show you that
we have gifts, too,

29:13.918 --> 29:15.334
will you trust us then?

29:16.626 --> 29:17.899
Show him.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.899
Show him what?

29:18.999 --> 29:22.375
Your gift. Show him your gift.

29:42.751 --> 29:44.359
This better
be good.

29:44.459 --> 29:46.999
We couldn't find him, boss.

29:48.959 --> 29:49.899
Now you listen to me

29:49.999 --> 29:52.401
and you listen
real good.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.150
Bo's giving the townsfolk ideas

29:54.250 --> 29:57.167
and I don't want 'em
getting ideas.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.234
No one knows where he's at.

29:59.334 --> 30:00.442
And if they do,

30:00.542 --> 30:01.899
they ain't talking.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.876
Well, you make 'em talk!

30:04.626 --> 30:06.734
This town is mine!

30:06.834 --> 30:08.192
And it's going to stay mine.

30:08.292 --> 30:10.983
When that railroad
comes through,

30:11.083 --> 30:12.899
mark my words, it will,

30:12.999 --> 30:15.609
when I'm selling
this land,

30:15.709 --> 30:17.609
that land is gonna be worth more

30:17.709 --> 30:21.234
than any you three
are capable of imagining.

30:21.334 --> 30:23.751
(<i>door opens</i>)

30:25.042 --> 30:29.609

to tell me, Cal.

30:29.709 --> 30:32.459
I know where Bo is hiding.

30:32.999 --> 30:33.942
Well, finally,

30:34.042 --> 30:38.876
someone knows
what's good for 'em.

30:40.334 --> 30:41.983
All right.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.150
The first thing that we need

30:43.250 --> 30:45.792
to do is get that bullet
out of you.

30:48.459 --> 30:50.959
This is gonna hurt.

31:05.918 --> 31:09.751
SUTTER:
I warned you, you half-breed!

31:12.792 --> 31:13.999
No!

31:17.999 --> 31:20.417
(<i>screeches</i>)

31:26.209 --> 31:28.417
I believe you.

31:35.918 --> 31:38.609
(<i>sobbing hysterically</i>)

31:38.709 --> 31:39.899
It's okay. You're okay.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.859
Take a deep breath.

31:40.959 --> 31:45.709
I saw. I saw
what they're gonna do to Bo!

31:46.667 --> 31:48.042
It was horrible!

31:48.584 --> 31:50.109
You think he saw it, too?

31:50.209 --> 31:52.484
I know he did!

31:52.584 --> 31:53.734
I felt it!

31:53.834 --> 31:55.150
And when he did,

31:55.250 --> 31:58.442
they didn't help him,

31:58.542 --> 32:01.025
They didn't do anything.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.359
So what do we do now?

32:02.459 --> 32:04.983
There's nothing else we can do
but wait.

32:05.083 --> 32:06.692
It's up to Prue
and Cole.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.401
And you call yourself
their guardian angel?

32:08.501 --> 32:09.899
What the hell good
is a whitelighter

32:09.999 --> 32:11.317
if all you can do
is stand there

32:11.417 --> 32:12.734
and watch my daughter die?!

32:12.834 --> 32:13.776
No, Dad, please don't!

32:13.876 --> 32:15.275
You're not helping.

32:15.375 --> 32:15.899
And he is?!

32:15.999 --> 32:16.900
Why don't you do something?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.067
Isn't that your job?

32:18.167 --> 32:20.150
You know, I am doing something.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.899
I am trusting your other
daughter Prue.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.192
You know, I know
that you feel helpless.

32:24.292 --> 32:24.899
We all do.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.067
But Prue is not gonna
let Phoebe die,

32:26.167 --> 32:26.942
and neither is Cole.

32:27.042 --> 32:29.692
Oh, so now I have to trust
a demon?

32:29.792 --> 32:33.109
As much as I hate to say this,
Cole loves Phoebe.

32:33.209 --> 32:36.025
He took a huge risk
to come here and try

32:36.125 --> 32:36.942
and prove himself to her,

32:37.042 --> 32:40.918
and he will do whatever it takes
to save her life.

32:43.709 --> 32:44.442
He's right.

32:44.542 --> 32:45.899
How can you be so sure?

32:45.999 --> 32:53.125
Because he loves me
as much as I love him.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.250
(<i>horse whinnies</i>)

33:13.334 --> 33:14.818
You learn fast.

33:14.918 --> 33:15.484
Thanks.

33:15.584 --> 33:17.459
I have a few gifts, too.

33:18.999 --> 33:21.899
Sutter's men just showed up.
We better get Bo out of here.

33:21.999 --> 33:22.899
What... how did they find us?

33:22.999 --> 33:24.401
We must have been followed.

33:24.501 --> 33:24.994
I'll shimmer him

33:25.004 --> 33:26.983
back to Leo,
then come back for you two.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.401
No.

33:28.501 --> 33:29.692
What do you mean no?

33:29.792 --> 33:30.899
He dies, Phoebe dies.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.317
Taking Bo out of here

33:32.417 --> 33:33.899
will not break
the time loop.

33:33.999 --> 33:35.192
It'll save Phoebe.

33:35.292 --> 33:38.359
Well, there's more
than just Phoebe's life

33:38.459 --> 33:40.459
on the line here, Cole.

33:40.834 --> 33:43.401
We have to break
the curse by sundown.

33:43.501 --> 33:44.609
Otherwise
this entire town

33:44.709 --> 33:47.918
is doomed to repeat the same day
over and over again.

33:48.375 --> 33:49.692
Are you seriously telling me

33:49.792 --> 33:50.899
that you're willing to sacrifice

33:50.999 --> 33:53.692
your sister's life for a town
full of cowards?

33:53.792 --> 33:54.245
What I'm saying to you

33:54.255 --> 33:56.859
is that there is a greater good
at stake here.

33:56.959 --> 33:57.899
One that I can't just

33:57.999 --> 34:01.192
walk away from, and one that you
shouldn't walk away from.

34:01.292 --> 34:02.900
if you truly expect to be good.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.109
(<i>guns cocking</i>)

34:06.209 --> 34:07.120
SLADE:
We know you're in there, Bo.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.067
Come on out with your hands up
and nobody gets hurt.

34:10.167 --> 34:13.275
What's it gonna be, Bo?

34:13.375 --> 34:15.899
All right,
how do we break the curse?

34:15.998 --> 34:18.899
I don't know, but I do know it
hinges on keeping Bo alive.

34:18.998 --> 34:19.983
BO:
No, it doesn't.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.692
The curse isn't about me,

34:23.792 --> 34:25.751
or about Sutter.

34:26.708 --> 34:27.983
It's about them.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.734
The townspeople
who stood there

34:29.833 --> 34:31.067
and watched me die.

34:31.167 --> 34:35.192
The only way is for me
to give myself up.

34:35.292 --> 34:35.900
No!

34:36.000 --> 34:37.899
It's okay, Isabel.

34:37.998 --> 34:39.542
Have faith.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.317
They'll kill you.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.609
Maybe.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.442
This curse came from

34:46.542 --> 34:47.983
my father's people.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.942
I understand that now.

34:50.042 --> 34:51.609
It's meant to heal,

34:51.708 --> 34:55.067
to teach the townspeople
to act without shame.

34:55.167 --> 34:56.983
I have to give
them that chance.

34:57.083 --> 35:00.999
Helping them to save you,
saves themselves.

35:40.999 --> 35:46.417
I want you all to see what
happens when people cross me.

35:53.042 --> 35:54.859
Bo... no.

35:54.959 --> 35:55.899
Don't.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
He knows what he's doing.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.999
(<i>screams</i>)

36:18.834 --> 36:20.899
What's the matter, boy?

36:20.999 --> 36:24.042
You too stupid to scream?

36:39.375 --> 36:43.250
I want you to beg for mercy!

36:44.876 --> 36:47.317
(<i>sobbing</i>)

36:47.417 --> 36:50.109
What are you people doing?

36:50.209 --> 36:51.859
Look at him!

36:51.959 --> 36:55.899
All right, he has the courage
to fight Sutter for all of you!

36:55.999 --> 36:58.942
You can't just stand there
and watch him die!

36:59.042 --> 37:00.899
You have
to do something!

37:00.999 --> 37:02.484
You can take him down!

37:02.584 --> 37:04.776
COLE:
Sutter can't take
all of you out.

37:04.876 --> 37:07.542
You need to do what's right!

37:08.626 --> 37:11.567
PRUE:
You cannot just stand by
and let this happen.

37:11.667 --> 37:12.859
Stand up to him!

37:12.959 --> 37:13.899
Don't be scared!

No!

Nobody crosses me.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.542
(<i>gun cocking</i>)

37:39.375 --> 37:44.584
I think you just ought
to leave Bo alone, Sutter!

37:44.999 --> 37:48.459
You just signed
your own death certificate.

37:48.959 --> 37:49.899
(<i>gun cocking</i>)

37:49.999 --> 37:50.899
You want to kill Bo,

37:50.999 --> 37:54.651
you're gonna have
to kill me, too.

37:54.751 --> 37:56.317
We're with you, Cal.

37:56.417 --> 37:58.651
You heard him, Sutter!

37:58.751 --> 38:00.692
We got you now.

38:00.792 --> 38:01.192
Are you okay?

38:01.292 --> 38:02.651
CAL:
Let her go Sutter!

38:02.751 --> 38:03.204
Leave her alone!

38:03.214 --> 38:06.234
Anybody comes after me
and she's dead.

38:06.334 --> 38:08.234
Now can we do something?

38:08.334 --> 38:09.667
Oh, yeah.

38:17.501 --> 38:19.709
Bo... Bo...

(<i>gunshot</i>)

38:34.417 --> 38:36.918
(<i>horse whinnying</i>)

39:05.959 --> 39:09.942
I don't think Sutter's
going to be a problem anymore.

39:10.042 --> 39:11.401
What about the curse?

39:11.501 --> 39:13.692
It's a beautiful sunset,
isn't it?

39:13.792 --> 39:17.150
I don't think there's
been one quite like it

39:17.250 --> 39:18.526
in 128 years.

39:18.626 --> 39:20.292
(<i>gunshot</i>)

39:21.999 --> 39:25.167
Looks like you're
out of bullets.

39:25.999 --> 39:27.899
(<i>chuckles</i>)

39:27.999 --> 39:30.899
I'm gonna enjoy this.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.859
See you in hell.

39:32.959 --> 39:35.417
Been there, done that.

39:40.584 --> 39:42.125
(<i>screaming</i>)

39:43.999 --> 39:46.999
(<i>laughing</i>)

39:47.834 --> 39:51.999
Like I said, once a demon,
always a demon.

40:00.959 --> 40:01.859
So, where are they?

40:01.959 --> 40:04.983
I don't know unless
they didn't make it out.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.999
Don't even say it.
Don't even think it.

40:09.584 --> 40:11.025
Ew!

40:11.125 --> 40:11.899
Finally.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.899
What took you so long?
We've been worried sick.

40:13.999 --> 40:17.459
Sorry, we have a few, uh...
loose ends to tie up.

40:17.834 --> 40:18.818
Are you okay?

40:18.918 --> 40:20.109
I'm great.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.401
Thank you--

40:21.501 --> 40:23.375
both of you.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.275
And the time loop?

40:26.375 --> 40:27.442
Broken.

40:27.542 --> 40:30.651
They will never have
to live that horror again.

40:30.751 --> 40:32.899
So then, where are they?

40:32.999 --> 40:35.609
I don't know, probably
living out their lives

40:35.709 --> 40:36.899
in a parallel plane, I guess.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.609
LEO:
Don't think about it
too much, Victor.

40:39.709 --> 40:40.900
It'll just give
you a headache.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.609
Okay, uh... anybody up
for a rehearsal dinner?

40:44.709 --> 40:47.083
Absolutely,
I'm starving.

40:50.834 --> 40:53.067
Well I guess
I should be going.

40:53.167 --> 40:56.959
Yeah, that would probably be
a good idea.

41:02.999 --> 41:05.709
You're not going anywhere.

41:06.999 --> 41:10.959
Phoebe, I don't want
to cause any trouble.

41:22.042 --> 41:26.042
You're staying.
And that's that.

41:27.626 --> 41:31.209
All right then, shall we?

41:32.292 --> 41:34.417
Yeah.

41:40.542 --> 41:44.999
