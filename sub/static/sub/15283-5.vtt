[Dog barking]

02:57.170 --> 02:58.937
What can I get you?

02:59.005 --> 03:01.106
I'll take a brownie.

03:01.174 --> 03:03.942
No, the big one
in the corner.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.548
Dessert
for breakfast?

03:09.615 --> 03:11.083
Must be
special occasion.

03:11.150 --> 03:14.119
I just got
some good news.

03:14.187 --> 03:15.420
Care to share?

03:17.023 --> 03:18.457
Nope, don't want
to jinx it.

03:18.524 --> 03:21.626
Ok. I can
understand that.

03:21.694 --> 03:23.295
Congratulations.

03:23.363 --> 03:25.297
My mom always says
to make time

03:25.365 --> 03:28.066
to celebrate
the little victories.

03:28.134 --> 03:29.301
I like that.

03:29.369 --> 03:30.969
Maybe I should take
your mother's advice

03:31.037 --> 03:32.637
and get something
sweet with my coffee.

03:32.705 --> 03:35.807
Oh, yeah?
What are you celebrating?

03:35.875 --> 03:38.210
I'll think
of something.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.178
They must
love you here.

03:40.246 --> 03:42.781
What do you mean?

03:42.849 --> 03:45.050
You throw out
your first cup of coffee

03:45.118 --> 03:47.052
and then you
get back in line for more.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.154
So, either you love
paying for bad coffee,

03:49.222 --> 03:53.191
or you did all that
just to talk to me.

03:58.331 --> 03:59.598
You got me.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.236
Have a nice day, Derek.

04:09.042 --> 04:10.642
So wait,
she knew your name?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.878
I don't know how I could
forget a face like hers.

04:12.945 --> 04:15.280
You've been with so many girls that
you can't remember all their names?

04:15.348 --> 04:16.748
Oh, come on,
are you surprised?

04:16.815 --> 04:19.051
This has never
happened to me before.

04:19.118 --> 04:21.119
It hasn't happened
to me before either.

04:21.187 --> 04:22.387
Well, it can't
happen to you.

04:22.455 --> 04:23.955
You have
an eidetic memory.

04:24.023 --> 04:25.991
Besides, you only got
one name to remember.

04:26.059 --> 04:27.459
[Laughter]

04:27.527 --> 04:29.594
Ok. Six victims have
been killed

04:29.662 --> 04:31.596
in a series of
burglar/homicides

04:31.664 --> 04:33.765
all over central
California.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.102
In order... Bakersfield,
Fresno, Chico

04:37.170 --> 04:41.440
and, two nights ago, Alan and
Brenda Paisley in Sacramento.

04:41.507 --> 04:43.575
Big area.
Are we sure it's the same unsub?

04:43.643 --> 04:45.377
His DNA was found
in all the homes.

04:45.445 --> 04:47.779
They hadn't connected it because
he crossed jurisdictional lines.

04:47.847 --> 04:52.017
The head of the Sacramento Field Office
has established a multi-agency task force

04:52.085 --> 04:53.285
and he wants us
to run point.

04:53.353 --> 04:55.287
Looks like we got a lot of
investigators on this one.

04:55.355 --> 04:57.189
We'll streamline it
if we need to.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.891
You should know that
they've already named him

04:59.959 --> 05:01.526
the ""Highway 99 Killer."

05:01.594 --> 05:03.228
We'll deal with that
when we get there.

05:03.296 --> 05:06.031
He targets 1 to
2-person households.

05:06.099 --> 05:08.233
He kills the victims
while they sleep.

05:08.301 --> 05:11.036
Blunt force trauma with
objects found at the home.

05:11.104 --> 05:13.271
Multiple bashes
to the head.

05:13.339 --> 05:14.654
After he kills the victims,

05:14.655 --> 05:16.408
he ransacks the
homes for valuables.

05:16.476 --> 05:18.877
Which is not unusual for a
nighttime burglary-homicide.

05:18.945 --> 05:22.414
What's unique about this unsub
is that after he kills them,

05:22.482 --> 05:25.150
apparently he sits down
to dinner in their homes.

05:25.218 --> 05:27.285
They found his DNA all
over the food and the table.

05:27.353 --> 05:29.287
Are these burglaries
that turned into homicides

05:29.355 --> 05:31.656
or homicides that
turned into burglaries?

05:31.724 --> 05:32.730
Between the two offenses,

05:32.731 --> 05:34.459
it seems the primary
motivation is homicide.

05:34.527 --> 05:37.029
Otherwise, he would have just
stolen the items and fled.

05:37.096 --> 05:38.864
But he stays
there for hours.

05:38.931 --> 05:40.732
He eats their food,
he tries on their clothes,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.201
he showers,
he even sleeps in their beds.

05:43.269 --> 05:45.771
It's like Goldilocks
became a serial killer.

05:45.838 --> 05:49.541
They've got plenty of DNA,
but they found no fingerprints.

05:49.609 --> 05:51.843
He doesn't take their cars.
So, how does he get there?

05:51.911 --> 05:54.746
No witness reports of
strange cars on the street.

05:54.814 --> 05:57.816
No prints, no gun, no noise,
no car, no witnesses.

05:57.884 --> 05:59.718
This all adds up to
prior experience.

05:59.786 --> 06:01.153
There's a record
on him somewhere.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.422
And until we find it,
he's moved on to another town.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.324
Which could be anywhere.

06:06.392 --> 06:07.392
[Train whistle]

06:52.183 --> 06:53.683
"Plenty sits still.

06:53.751 --> 06:56.219
Hunger is a wanderer."

06:56.287 --> 06:57.754
Zulu proverb.

06:57.788 --> 07:01.124
So, four homes
in about five weeks.

07:01.192 --> 07:04.127
The first one at the beginning
of September in Bakersfield.

07:04.195 --> 07:06.396
Then Fresno a week later.

07:06.464 --> 07:08.031
Chico eight days after that.

07:08.099 --> 07:09.366
Then he changes direction,

07:09.433 --> 07:13.036
heads south to Sacramento
at the end of September.

07:13.104 --> 07:15.538
These crime scenes are
spread out over 400 miles.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.674
I mean, how many serial
killers move around like that?

07:17.742 --> 07:19.209
Not many.
Of the ones who do,

07:19.276 --> 07:21.511
we categorize them
into two subgroups.

07:21.579 --> 07:23.380
In one model,
he's an itinerant homeless person,

07:23.447 --> 07:24.814
someone who's
been displaced.

07:24.882 --> 07:26.850
With the second type, their
occupation allows them to travel.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.418
He could be killing
while on business.

07:28.486 --> 07:29.886
A truck driver
make sense?

07:29.954 --> 07:32.021
Long-haul truck driver Bruce
Mendenhall shot his victims

07:32.089 --> 07:35.392
and disposed of their bodies at truck stops,
across at least 4 different states.

07:35.459 --> 07:37.761
But Mendenhall targeted
mostly high-risk victims.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.229
Prostitutes and
hitchhikers,

07:39.296 --> 07:40.830
he picked up right
off the highway.

07:40.898 --> 07:43.199
A truck driver's "M.O.,"
he'd use his rig for getaway.

07:43.234 --> 07:45.502
Somebody would have noticed a tractor
trailer parked in the neighborhood.

07:45.569 --> 07:47.437
How about someone
in corporate sales?

07:47.505 --> 07:48.838
They still travel.

07:48.906 --> 07:50.006
Or computer
professionals.

07:50.074 --> 07:51.608
They travel to
install software.

07:51.675 --> 07:52.842
Or someone in
real estate.

07:52.910 --> 07:54.144
Like a land
assessor.

07:54.211 --> 07:56.146
They just discovered
a new murder.

07:56.213 --> 07:57.747
In Modesto.

07:57.815 --> 07:59.416
He went south again.

07:59.483 --> 08:02.018
Right, when we land, Reid, JJ and I
will go to task force headquarters.

08:02.086 --> 08:03.920
The 3 of you...
Modesto.

08:03.988 --> 08:06.156
We're going to log
some miles on this one.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.760
I'm Agent Liman.

08:10.828 --> 08:11.761
Hi, Agent Jareau.

08:11.829 --> 08:13.596
These are Agents
Hotchner and Reid.

08:13.664 --> 08:16.166
We reserved
this room for you.

08:21.372 --> 08:24.107
Who named him this?

08:24.175 --> 08:26.009
I did.

08:26.077 --> 08:28.545
I'm gonna go get
started on that memo.

08:28.612 --> 08:30.213
I'm gonna help you.

08:30.281 --> 08:32.215
I figured he's on Highway 99,

08:32.283 --> 08:33.582
why not call him
the "Highway 99 Killer"?

08:33.650 --> 08:36.885
I got C.H.P. to beef up
presence all over Highway 99,

08:36.953 --> 08:40.056
hang on, slow down.
We're going to distribute a memo

08:40.124 --> 08:42.225
to all the investigators,
retracting the name.

08:42.293 --> 08:44.027
I don't understand.

08:44.095 --> 08:45.995
Gary Ridgeway,
the Green River Killer,

08:46.063 --> 08:47.437
was burying the
bodies of his victims

08:47.438 --> 08:48.631
in the remote woods outside Seattle.

08:48.699 --> 08:50.300
Investigators never
thought to look there

08:50.368 --> 08:52.869
because they were too busy only
looking in the Green River area.

08:52.937 --> 08:55.138
All due respect, we're not
finding bodies in remote woods.

08:55.206 --> 08:58.174
These are five homes in cities
connected by one major highway.

08:58.242 --> 09:01.111
But by calling him this, you
are detrimentally influencing

09:01.178 --> 09:03.279
the investigation. And you're
establishing a relationship

09:03.347 --> 09:06.182
in the minds of the investigators
with only this highway.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.586
Point taken. Fire number one
put out. Anything else, sir?

09:09.653 --> 09:11.521
Are these people all
involved in the investigation?

09:11.589 --> 09:12.522
Yes, they are.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.424
That's too many.
What?

09:14.492 --> 09:16.760
It's our experience in task
force situations

09:16.827 --> 09:19.496
that excessive personnel
can be counterproductive.

09:19.563 --> 09:21.097
These people have
come from far away.

09:21.165 --> 09:22.565
They've been on the
case long before you.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.868
I understand that, but in
order to function effectively

09:24.935 --> 09:26.503
this task force needs
a focused headquarters

09:26.570 --> 09:29.339
free from the congestion
of auxiliary personnel.

09:29.407 --> 09:33.543
These officers will be much
more helpful in their hometowns.

09:33.611 --> 09:34.811
Are we in agreement?

09:34.879 --> 09:38.281
I'll start sending people home.
Thank you.

09:46.791 --> 09:49.426
All right,
listen up, guys.

09:49.493 --> 09:50.693
How'd he take it?

09:50.761 --> 09:52.429
He'll get over it.

10:16.987 --> 10:17.987
I'm Detective Daniels.

10:18.055 --> 10:20.824
How are you doing?
Agent Morgan.

10:20.891 --> 10:23.960
Agent Rossi.
Agent Prentice.

10:24.028 --> 10:25.228
This way.

10:28.466 --> 10:29.733
You see something?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.235
It's what I don't see.
What I don't hear.

10:32.303 --> 10:33.703
There's no dogs barking.

10:33.771 --> 10:35.972
No sign for an alarm system.
No system.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.574
They have
outdoor lights.

10:37.641 --> 10:39.075
Neighbors said
they weren't on.

10:39.143 --> 10:41.044
This house has the three basic
things that a burglar looks for.

10:41.112 --> 10:43.580
No dog, no alarm
and definitely no lights.

10:43.647 --> 10:47.684
Tells us the unsub's patient enough
to find a house that's vulnerable.

10:47.752 --> 10:48.885
There's
the neighbor.

10:48.953 --> 10:50.887
I'll talk to her.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.328
Nail polish remover?

10:58.396 --> 10:59.396
I think so.

11:00.731 --> 11:01.931
He get under
the sink?

11:01.999 --> 11:03.066
How'd you know?

11:03.134 --> 11:04.467
I've seen this kind
of thing before

11:04.535 --> 11:07.070
with burglaries when the
criminal is a substance abuser.

11:07.138 --> 11:08.772
Oftentimes they huff
household cleaners,

11:08.839 --> 11:10.373
just so
they can get high.

11:10.441 --> 11:12.008
What was
his point of entry?

11:12.076 --> 11:14.077
Laundry room through
an unlocked window.

11:14.145 --> 11:16.413
Explains where he found
the murder weapon.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.149
Serious overkill.
He's killing with rage.

11:19.216 --> 11:21.051
How does a man
with such rage calm himself

11:21.118 --> 11:22.185
down enough
to make coffee and eggs?

11:22.253 --> 11:23.853
He's disorganized,

11:23.921 --> 11:25.522
picks an opportunistic weapon
at a crime scene,

11:25.589 --> 11:26.990
strikes with rage...

11:27.058 --> 11:30.093
organized enough though,
to follow a ritual after he kills.

11:30.161 --> 11:31.661
Cools off. Cleans up,

11:31.729 --> 11:34.164
goes through
their things, eats.

11:34.231 --> 11:37.701
Intense rage followed by a long period
of calmness spent inside the house.

11:37.768 --> 11:38.802
Is that unusual?

11:38.869 --> 11:40.437
Very.

11:40.504 --> 11:43.106
Can you explain
what he does with his clothes?

11:43.174 --> 11:44.541
His clothes?

11:46.210 --> 11:47.610
Did you happen
to notice any strangers

11:47.678 --> 11:48.878
in the neighborhood
last night?

11:48.946 --> 11:51.614
No. Nothing like this has
ever happened around here.

11:51.682 --> 11:54.751
When was the last time you spoke
to or heard from the Sullivans?

11:54.819 --> 11:57.420
I saw Larry this morning
on the balcony

11:57.488 --> 11:58.788
when I went out
to get the paper.

11:58.856 --> 12:00.356
And what time was that?

12:00.424 --> 12:01.958
About 5:30 am.

12:03.794 --> 12:06.963
Mrs. Nelson, are you sure you
saw someone up there this morning?

12:07.031 --> 12:09.833
Well, it was still dark out,
but yes, I'm sure.

12:09.900 --> 12:10.934
Why?

12:11.001 --> 12:14.104
Your neighbors died
around 1:00 am.

12:15.539 --> 12:16.973
When we found
the deceased,

12:17.041 --> 12:19.008
the shirt was placed
over his chest.

12:19.076 --> 12:20.744
The pants over his legs.

12:20.811 --> 12:22.312
This is the first time
we're hearing this.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.614
Look at his clothes, Rossi,
the dirt stain.

12:24.682 --> 12:26.483
Why would
he cover up the body?

12:26.550 --> 12:29.786
He wears their clean clothes,
sleeps in their nice bed,

12:29.854 --> 12:32.756
and then puts his dirty clothes
on the male victim's body.

12:32.823 --> 12:35.091
This might be some
form of transference.

12:35.159 --> 12:36.926
Transfer of what?

12:36.994 --> 12:39.596
By symbolically dressing
Mr. Sullivan in his clothes,

12:39.663 --> 12:41.765
he's equalizing
their status.

12:41.832 --> 12:45.668
Mr. Sullivan has all these
things and he doesn't.

12:45.736 --> 12:48.038
This guys got a problem
with his station in life.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.206
He can't bring himself
up on his own,

12:50.274 --> 12:52.709
so he makes himself feel
better by destroying others

12:52.743 --> 12:53.943
and living
their lives.

12:54.011 --> 12:55.612
That might be
why he stays so long.

12:55.679 --> 12:57.514
He needs that time just
so he can feel at home.

12:57.581 --> 13:00.583
And pretends
this is all his.

13:00.651 --> 13:02.385
He's playing out
his fantasy.

13:02.453 --> 13:05.321
Given this behavior, the dirty
clothes, the cheap drug choice,

13:05.389 --> 13:07.490
I'd say we're looking
for someone who's homeless.

13:07.558 --> 13:10.326
How does a homeless man move
about the state like this?

13:10.394 --> 13:11.327
I have one idea.

13:11.395 --> 13:12.462
Yeah?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.497
Reid, are you in
front of a map?

13:14.565 --> 13:16.132
Yeah, I am now.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.668
I think I know how the
unsub's getting around.

13:18.736 --> 13:22.072
Do you see tracks linking
Bakersfield to Sacramento?

13:23.441 --> 13:25.208

13:54.538 --> 13:55.472
[Slap]

15:03.470 --> 15:06.706
The guy we're looking for is
using freight trains to get around.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.241
He targets homes
within a mile of the tracks.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.977
Bulls and 'bos don't
usually cross paths.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.579
Bulls and 'bos?

15:13.647 --> 15:15.281
They call
rail cops bulls.

15:15.349 --> 15:18.517
We call them 'bos,
as in hobos.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.986
You're saying you rarely
see hobos around here?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.855
I see them plenty.
But to tell you the truth,

15:22.923 --> 15:25.191
I'm nothing more
than an armed scarecrow.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.327
They see me coming,
they get the hell away.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.297
Their biggest problem
is with each other.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.765
You mean
turf disputes?

15:32.833 --> 15:37.003
You get two of them in one
boxcar, it usually gets ugly.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.171
So, if a 'bo jumps off one
of these trains in a new town,

15:39.239 --> 15:40.740
is there someplace
he goes first?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.541
The jungle.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.276
That's what
they call the camps.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.747
Local one's a couple
of hundred yards that way.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.583
Do you happen to have
a vending machine in here?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.952
Yeah.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.887
Where are you?
I'm just off Highway 99,

15:54.955 --> 15:58.624
the whole drive up from Modesto,
all I see are crops.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.559
Just rows and rows
of crops.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.162
Farmlands. You can't see
that from standard road maps.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.830
The railway track
runs parallel

16:04.898 --> 16:06.799
to highway 99
most of the way.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.769
I think I'm seeing
a lot of what the unsub saw.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.871
Most of central California
is one big valley,

16:11.938 --> 16:14.540
a flat basin completely surrounded
by mountain ranges on all sides,

16:14.608 --> 16:17.977
supported by rivers, lakes and aqueducts.
It's ideal for farming.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.545
Well, I don't know what
it gets us, but I think

16:19.613 --> 16:21.380
we should at least factor
it into the conversation.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.548
I agree.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.055

central California.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.456

unsolved homicides

16:30.524 --> 16:32.391
that involved nighttime
burglaries in homes

16:32.459 --> 16:34.193
within a mile
of train tracks.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.228
Oh, you think
there's more?

16:36.296 --> 16:37.730
I don't know.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.566
Let's get started.

16:40.634 --> 16:42.134
I'd just like to reiterate

16:42.202 --> 16:44.437
that this unsub is not
getting around on Highway 99.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.907
His travel is linked in close
proximity to railway lines.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.108
He's targeted
5 homes

16:49.176 --> 16:50.943
and killed 8 people
in 6 weeks.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.278
We're looking
for a male,

16:52.346 --> 16:55.114
indigent transient between
the ages of 25 and 45.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.950
He's fit enough for the physical
demands of train hopping,

16:58.018 --> 16:59.719
or "catching out"
as they call it.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.721
He'll be bruised from
jumping on and off trains.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.955
And he might also be beat up

17:03.023 --> 17:05.391
from just defending himself
in any kind of turf wars.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.426
He may look homeless, but he's taking
clothing from his victims' homes.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.762
So he'll be the only transient
on the tracks in clean clothing.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.131
The trains and
the rail yards are his home.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.665
And when he gets
tired of these,

17:13.733 --> 17:16.569
he chooses
a house to make his own.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.838
He'll have a pronounced
red, dry rash

17:18.905 --> 17:20.506
around his mouth and nose,

17:20.574 --> 17:23.041
what's commonly referred
to as a "sniffer's rash."

17:23.109 --> 17:24.276
How do we know that?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.810
He takes
household cleaners.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.015
And we believe he's abusing
them as psychoactive inhalants.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.450
Nail polish remover,
glue, paint thinner,

17:31.518 --> 17:34.620
lighter fluid, whatever is
the cheapest high available.

17:34.688 --> 17:36.956
They're referred
to as "tollyheads"

17:37.024 --> 17:38.958
because they derive a
high from sniffing toluene,

17:39.026 --> 17:40.359
a chemical solvent.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.329
Once inhaled, the effects
are felt instantaneously.

17:43.397 --> 17:46.232
We believe he's living out
a fantasy in these homes.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.101
The fantasy is that it is
his house for the night.

17:49.169 --> 17:52.538
He spends hours enjoying the
comforts of his victims' homes.

17:52.606 --> 17:54.140
Upon leaving,
he takes clothing,

17:54.207 --> 17:56.676
money, jewelry,
and small electronics.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.878
If you get close to him,
you won't miss him.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.815
He will smell like a combination
of human filth and paint thinner.

trains from city to city.

kills them while they're sleeping.

it's funny?

and strengthen muscle.

in three more cities.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.760
How did I miss this?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.129
Small towns don't always
link their evidence up

21:03.196 --> 21:05.031
to state or national
DNA databases.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.500
It can happen when unsubs
cross jurisdictional lines.

giving us a way
to track migrants.

24:51.430 --> 24:54.399
So, I called the camps
and they're busy faxing me

24:54.466 --> 24:55.400
the lists I requested.

24:55.467 --> 24:56.734
All right.
Well, we need to see

24:56.802 --> 24:57.935
if any of these farm
workers traveled

24:58.003 --> 24:59.504
the same route
as our unsub.

25:03.609 --> 25:04.542
Remember this one?

25:04.610 --> 25:06.477
Yeah. Safe camp.

25:06.545 --> 25:08.146
How do you know
what all these signs mean?

25:08.213 --> 25:09.547
We had a little help.

25:09.615 --> 25:11.783
Rossi, safe water.

25:11.850 --> 25:13.384
When it's not dry.

25:13.452 --> 25:14.719
Here's another one.

25:14.787 --> 25:16.554
Oh, yeah, the train.

25:16.622 --> 25:18.790
Catch you out here.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.561
This is Mildred
Younce's address.

25:23.629 --> 25:26.230
Ok.

25:26.298 --> 25:28.066
The CAT means
friendly old lady.

25:28.133 --> 25:30.935
The "THE" means she trades
food or shelter for work.

25:31.003 --> 25:32.370
At 718 Maple.

25:32.438 --> 25:34.072
So whoever knows this code

25:34.139 --> 25:36.441
knew Mildred Younce opened
up her house to strangers?

25:36.508 --> 25:37.809
If you wanted
the house to yourself,

25:37.876 --> 25:39.143
the only thing
standing in your way

25:39.211 --> 25:40.511
is a defenseless
little old lady.

25:40.579 --> 25:42.313
[Cell phone rings]

25:42.381 --> 25:43.514
Yeah, JJ. Go ahead.

25:43.582 --> 25:45.616
Hey, Morgan,
there's an apple farm

25:45.684 --> 25:47.952
about three miles away from
Mildred Younce's house.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.320
Yeah. We saw it
on the way over here.

25:49.388 --> 25:50.588
Can you and Rossi go there

25:50.656 --> 25:52.457
and see if they kept
employment records?

25:52.524 --> 25:54.659
Hotch wants a list of people
who worked there

25:54.727 --> 25:56.427
the few days before
Mildred was killed.

25:56.495 --> 25:57.662
All right.
We're on our way.

26:00.899 --> 26:02.600
Hey, update
from headquarters.

26:02.668 --> 26:06.671
Rossi and Morgan are on their
way to that farm in Tehachapi.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.006
I found a representative

26:08.073 --> 26:10.208
from the local housing
authority, Cesar Jimenez.

26:10.275 --> 26:11.476
He's expecting you.

26:11.543 --> 26:12.977
Press release
went out to the media

26:13.045 --> 26:14.879
with a photo
from the pawn shop.

26:14.947 --> 26:16.814
And I'm waiting
to hear back from Garcia

26:16.882 --> 26:19.017
about tracking migrants
who may have traveled

26:19.084 --> 26:20.385
the same route as our unsub.

26:20.452 --> 26:21.519
JJ, what are we
going to do without you

26:21.587 --> 26:23.154
when you go
on maternity leave?

26:23.222 --> 26:25.623
You think I'd just
leave you hanging?

26:25.691 --> 26:27.258
Does that mean
you have a plan?

26:27.326 --> 26:28.393
I don't know.
You'll see.

26:32.097 --> 26:33.931
[Beeping]

26:40.205 --> 26:41.205
[Speaking Spanish]

26:52.551 --> 26:54.085

26:54.153 --> 26:56.087
Hi. Cesar
from the Housing Authority.

26:56.155 --> 26:57.622
These are Agents
Printiss and Reid.

26:57.690 --> 26:59.157
Good morning.
Good morning.

26:59.224 --> 27:00.992
Thank you
for meeting us here.

27:01.060 --> 27:03.394
Does this man look
familiar to you?

27:04.830 --> 27:05.963
Hard to tell.

27:06.031 --> 27:07.799
Have you had any
complaints in the camps?

27:07.866 --> 27:09.634
This man would show
disruptive behavior.

27:09.702 --> 27:11.436
He might be stealing things
from other workers,

27:11.503 --> 27:12.637
starting fights.

27:12.705 --> 27:14.472
He sniffs chemicals
to get high.

27:14.540 --> 27:18.042
Well, our facilities have
a zero tolerance policy.

27:18.110 --> 27:20.611
No drinking, no drugs,
certainly no violence.

27:20.679 --> 27:24.515
Anyone who cannot follow these
rules would be kicked out.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.718
Have you kicked
anyone out recently?

27:26.785 --> 27:29.420
The camps in this area
are at full capacity.

27:29.488 --> 27:31.289
We have to turn people away.

27:31.357 --> 27:33.124
Thank you.

27:33.192 --> 27:35.259
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

27:39.098 --> 27:42.033
If he's pawning the
jewelry he's stealing

27:42.101 --> 27:45.036
to get money, why is he
still working in the fields?

27:45.104 --> 27:46.204
Here's another question.

27:46.271 --> 27:47.839
Why is he circling
the farm towns at all?

27:47.906 --> 27:51.442
There are over 140,000 miles
of tracks in this country.

27:51.510 --> 27:52.577
He could go anywhere.

27:52.644 --> 27:54.078
But he's still
in California.

27:54.146 --> 27:55.546
Something's
keeping him here.

27:55.614 --> 27:57.115
What is it?

27:58.217 --> 27:59.217
[Chatter in background]

28:25.844 --> 28:27.478
Ok, mini-lesson.

28:27.546 --> 28:29.347
Migrants travel and
work in these groups

28:29.415 --> 28:31.082
and the groups
are called cuadrillas.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.550
Now, I have found
one such cuadrilla

28:32.618 --> 28:34.752
that was in Chico at
the same time as our unsub.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.487
And then I checked
and they were

28:36.555 --> 28:38.489
in Sacramento and
Modesto and Vacaville

28:38.557 --> 28:39.924
at the same time
as our unsub as well.

28:39.992 --> 28:41.225
What about
the first town?

28:41.293 --> 28:42.560
I got employment records

28:42.628 --> 28:43.695
from the apple farm
in Tehachapi.

28:43.762 --> 28:46.364
This cuadrilla last
worked there two days

28:46.432 --> 28:48.266
before Mildred Younce
was killed.

28:48.334 --> 28:50.134
Now, here's the whammy.

28:50.202 --> 28:53.571
An Armando Salinas checked in
with this group in Tehachapi.

28:53.639 --> 28:54.939
But then,
he falls off the map.

28:55.007 --> 28:56.808
There's no sign of him
in any of the camps.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.242
Interesting.

28:58.310 --> 29:00.078
Double whammy. Customs and
immigration have a rap sheet

29:00.145 --> 29:02.313
on him for theft
and assault

29:02.381 --> 29:04.282
and he's wanted in
connection to some burglaries.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.084
There's the record
we've been looking for.

29:06.151 --> 29:07.585
Triple whammy.

29:07.653 --> 29:10.555
His fingerprints were one of 17
found at Mildred Younce's house.

29:10.622 --> 29:13.091
Get us his photo and get JJ
to get it out to the media.

29:13.158 --> 29:14.292
We're going to need
the public's help.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.094
Sending you his mug.

29:16.161 --> 29:17.829
The group that he's
been following,

29:17.896 --> 29:19.630
they checked into Lockeford
early this morning.

29:19.698 --> 29:20.832
That's not
far from you.

Let them go.

30:25.564 --> 30:27.165
We're sorry
to interrupt your evening.

30:27.232 --> 30:28.866
But we've come here
because we need your help.

31:15.595 --> 31:16.595
[Speaking Spanish]
Yeah, why don't you just...

31:30.309 --> 31:33.645
he likes to know
where I'm going.

31:33.713 --> 31:36.381
Why does he have
to follow you?

31:36.449 --> 31:37.649
Why isn't he
with you anymore?

31:37.717 --> 31:40.185
He's not a good worker.

31:40.253 --> 31:43.922
He got us fired
from a big job.

31:43.990 --> 31:47.492
My cuadrilla
wanted him gone.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.827
So you kicked him out?

31:48.895 --> 31:50.328
<i>Si.</i>

31:50.396 --> 31:53.231
Your brother has been
following you ever since.

31:53.299 --> 31:57.135
Burglarizing homes and
killing people in every city.

31:59.038 --> 32:02.140
Is that where
he gets the money from?

32:02.208 --> 32:03.408
What do you mean?

32:03.476 --> 32:06.111
He's been leaving me
money at the camps.

32:06.179 --> 32:08.380
Does he know you're in
Lockeford right now?

32:09.482 --> 32:13.452
I found this
at the camp today.

32:13.519 --> 32:15.420
Just--
<i>un momento.</i>

32:17.690 --> 32:20.459
The killings
started in Tehachapi.

32:20.526 --> 32:22.761
I think his brother rejecting
him must have been a stressor.

32:22.829 --> 32:25.163
Morgan and Rossi made it here,
they're with rail security.

32:25.231 --> 32:26.965
Hotch and Liman are
patrolling neighborhoods.

32:27.033 --> 32:28.300
Ok. I think it's time
to get these guys going.

32:28.368 --> 32:30.102
Excuse me. Could we have
your attention, please?

32:30.169 --> 32:31.136
Everybody?

32:31.204 --> 32:33.572
This is
Armando Ruis Salinas.

32:33.639 --> 32:36.274
He is 38 years old,
a Mexican national.

32:36.342 --> 32:38.176
We believe he is
currently in the vicinity

32:38.244 --> 32:40.612
of Lockeford and
its outlying towns.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.215
He'll only target homes
within a mile of train tracks.

32:43.282 --> 32:44.616
You'll be assigned
search quadrants.

32:44.684 --> 32:46.084
Think the way
a burglar would.

32:46.152 --> 32:49.254
Pay close attention to houses
that have no exterior lights on,

32:49.322 --> 32:52.090
no security alarm signs
or barking dogs nearby.

Let's go.

33:08.307 --> 33:10.509
Are you surprised the police
are looking for him?

33:11.511 --> 33:14.246
He's my half-brother.

33:14.313 --> 33:18.850
I wasn't around for him
when he was young.

33:18.918 --> 33:22.754
He's been in trouble
all his life.

33:22.822 --> 33:25.957
Was in jail in Mexico.

33:26.025 --> 33:32.664
I thought if he came to work
with me, he would change.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.574
I'm grateful to work.

33:42.642 --> 33:44.910
But Armando hated work.

33:44.977 --> 33:47.346
Hated the camps.

33:47.413 --> 33:54.386
Always complained he never
had a nice bed to sleep on.

33:54.454 --> 33:56.688
What if he's already
inside a house?

33:56.756 --> 33:58.990
Then we'll find more
bodies in the morning.

34:31.958 --> 34:36.395
When he was a kid,
he slept on the floor.

34:36.462 --> 34:42.234
In jail,
he slept on the floor.

34:42.301 --> 34:50.208
All he ever talked about was
having a house of his own.

34:50.275 --> 34:54.579

extremely dangerous.

39:53.513 --> 39:54.646
And Agent Morgan.

39:54.714 --> 39:56.214
Nice to see you again.

39:56.282 --> 39:59.518
Nice to see you, too.
So this must be the good news.

39:59.585 --> 40:01.753
This would be my brownie.

40:01.821 --> 40:03.455
You two have met?

40:03.523 --> 40:05.390
Briefly.

40:06.993 --> 40:09.294
Well, Agent Todd comes to us

40:09.362 --> 40:11.863
from 7 years
at counter-terrorism.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.799
I'm really looking
forward to working

40:13.866 --> 40:15.100
with the behavioral
analysis unit.

40:15.168 --> 40:16.601
We're starting
her training now.

40:16.669 --> 40:18.003
You're training
her right now?

40:18.071 --> 40:20.706
Well, we're kinda
running out of time.

40:20.773 --> 40:22.908
So...let me introduce you
to the rest of the team.

40:22.975 --> 40:25.444
Yeah. I'll see you
all in the field...

40:25.511 --> 40:26.845
team.

40:26.913 --> 40:28.280
We're looking
forward to it.

40:29.982 --> 40:34.119
So, is there anything
you want to tell us?

40:34.187 --> 40:36.121
Nope.

40:36.189 --> 40:37.122
Your forehead's
sweating.

40:37.190 --> 40:38.757
No, it's not.

40:38.825 --> 40:40.125
Oh, he's avoiding
eye contact.

40:40.193 --> 40:42.294
His blink rate
just sped up.

40:42.362 --> 40:45.263
You know, guys, I don't think I
want that burger too much anymore.

40:45.331 --> 40:46.898
Ah, come on.
You can't run from us.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.900
Oh, watch me.
Ohh. Ha ha!
