01:04.364 --> 01:06.565
They're so competitive,
I was just really excited

-about the fact--
-Are you talking about...

01:08.435 --> 01:10.302
Are you... are you talking about
Leonardo DiCaprio

-is always trying to win?
-Yeah, I'm just excited

01:11.738 --> 01:13.171
that he won,
because he actually,

01:13.174 --> 01:14.573
-was...
-Well, he fought a bear.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.075
-That's for you.
-Thanks.

[Edward] How?

01:44.171 --> 01:46.472
[June] I don't know.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.341
Oh, my god, I didn't think
he was ever gonna die.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.812
You know,
he's not immortal, June.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.315
I know, I'm not...
[sighs]

01:56.317 --> 01:58.650
I'm just saying, it's like,
he was so, you know.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.589
Like he was an alien
or something, and like...

02:03.591 --> 02:05.157
We don't know
a lot about aliens.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.525
Maybe they don't die, you know.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.531

-Cancer.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.599
Ugh.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.435
[June sighs deeply]

02:16.437 --> 02:19.438
Mm. Damn, it's hard
to make a joke about cancer.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.884
What? Hey, I got one. Ready?

02:31.886 --> 02:33.919
What does...
what does David Bowie do

02:33.921 --> 02:35.254
after going to the gym?

02:36.423 --> 02:37.973
God.

02:37.974 --> 02:39.524
I mean, it's like
a light has gone out,

02:39.527 --> 02:41.544
and you don't even see it.

02:41.545 --> 02:43.562
[June] I don't understand
how I can see it so clearly.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.430
And it's like
you can't see it at all.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.001
-[blows air]
-Stop!

02:49.002 --> 02:51.536
You're not taking
things seriously. I'm serious.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.572
[Edward] Hey, June,
we didn't know David Bowie.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.507
All right?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.342
Hate to break it to you.
We didn't know him.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.579
I made a list.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.482
[Edward] A list? Of what?

03:03.484 --> 03:06.285
Of things
that we need to work on.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.953
[Edward] Wait, is this...

03:07.955 --> 03:09.555
This is about your birthday?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.609
[June] Yeah.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.260
Of course,
that's what this is about.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.907
Time is running out.

03:16.908 --> 03:18.553
What if I don't become
the person

03:18.554 --> 03:20.199
that I'm supposed to be
before it does?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.817
We got plenty of time.

03:21.818 --> 03:23.434
No, we have less time
that you think we do.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.138
Okay.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.906
Uh, one, I think
that other couples

03:27.908 --> 03:29.942
are a lot happier than us.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.610
Oh, shit.
We're really doing this.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.911
Okay, uh...

03:32.913 --> 03:35.981
All right, well,
I, I think that, um,

03:35.983 --> 03:38.217
you're a lot happier
than you think you are.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.719
-[scoffs]
-You're just always seeing

03:39.720 --> 03:41.220
-the negatives.
-Two, uh, nothing has changed.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.921
I bring up, um, my feelings

03:42.923 --> 03:44.840
and like, things that bother me,
and when I tell them to you,

03:44.841 --> 03:46.758
then we just have the same fight
every time, all the time.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.360
Yeah, that's correct.
That's right.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.662
Because I'm me, and you're you.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.464
You make jokes about everything.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.801
And I, I need to take things
seriously sometimes.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.638
Well, that's really boring.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.374
Honey, I like some of the jokes,

04:02.376 --> 04:06.345
I just... I need to be
serious sometimes, too.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.384
You look so cute right now.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.685
No, sto-- Oh, no.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.321
Uh, four... Four.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.524
[June]
Uh, what about the future?

04:18.524 --> 04:20.726
Um, I wanna think about,
uh, family and children.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.127
-[Edward] Okay, all right.
-And all that normal...

04:22.128 --> 04:23.527
All right, I get it.
All right, stop, stop, stop.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.030
Like, I'm...

04:25.032 --> 04:26.398
Whoa. All right,
well, you know what,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.367
that terrifies me, okay?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.269
And you know that,
but like, I'm in.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.587
Like I'm ride or die with you,

04:31.588 --> 04:32.904
-you know what I mean?
-Great you're in.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.221
-That's great.
-But, like,

04:34.222 --> 04:35.538
you're just gonna have to, like,
drag me through that part.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.376
I don't wanna drag you
through anything, okay?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.644
I want a partner.

04:38.646 --> 04:42.281
What does all of this
have to do with David Bowie?

04:42.283 --> 04:44.516
I just feel like,
you just don't understand.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.840
That's who I am, June.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.163
You don't understand
why he was so important.

04:47.164 --> 04:48.486
Do you want me
to be somebody else?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.621
No.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.424
You just... You don't...

04:52.426 --> 04:53.692
You don't compromise.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.427
What? I do compromise.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.862
And what about
taking care of us?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.296
-I do it all the time.
-[June] You know, I, I...

04:58.299 --> 05:00.332
I provide things.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.401
You didn't buy this house, June.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.703
[Edward] You got it
because somebody else died.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.472
You know, you should take stock
in things too.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.640
I do. I take stock all the time.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.042
When I'm hurt, when I'm hurting,

05:10.044 --> 05:12.194
when you hurt my feelings,

05:12.195 --> 05:14.345
you never ever do
a grand gesture.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.447
Like a... what?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.482
A grand gesture?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.651
Yeah. Yeah, it's like,
when I'm hurt,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.353
then you would apologize

05:21.355 --> 05:23.322
and then you would
do something nice for me.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.059
I do nice things for you.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.727
I know that.
That's not what I'm saying.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.596
I'm saying that times like now,
when I'm upset,

05:31.598 --> 05:34.099
now would be a time
when you would do

05:34.101 --> 05:35.667
-a nice thing for me.
-Like what?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.569
I can't tell you what to do,

05:37.570 --> 05:39.470
because then you're gonna
do that exact thing

05:39.473 --> 05:41.340
and then I'm just gonna
be disappointed

05:41.342 --> 05:43.775
-that I have to hand feed you
-[chuckling]

05:43.777 --> 05:46.411
every little thing.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.381
How am I supposed
to know otherwise?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.984
You're just supposed to know.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.586
Honey, that's how we know
if we're compatible or not.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.754
[Edward] Hey.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.859
We're compatible.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.394
-Don't do that.
-We're compatible.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.363
[June] I'm not talking
about compatible

06:04.365 --> 06:05.397
-like that.
-[Edward] Mm.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.865
[chuckling]

06:08.135 --> 06:09.735
-We're compatible.
-Stop it!

06:09.737 --> 06:11.403
[laughs]

06:13.407 --> 06:15.474
-[Edward] We're compatible!
-Okay!

06:17.745 --> 06:19.711
[June] How do you even
know anyway?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.646
How do you even know
that we're compatible?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.515
[clattering]

06:26.620 --> 06:29.188
I just do.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.757
Okay, well, I don't, okay?
I don't know that.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.960
And that is why
I need the grand gesture.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.670
[clatters, thuds]

06:50.811 --> 06:53.812
[Edward] Uh, can you
just give me an example?

06:55.516 --> 06:58.917
I won't do that one, I'll just
do something like it, I promise.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.954
No. See, that's exactly
what I'm saying. I just...

07:02.956 --> 07:06.558
I need you to be able to,
like, read my mind sometimes.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.529
I just...
I, I can't do that, June.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.765
Well, that's what I need.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.151
Sorry.

07:16.152 --> 07:17.835
That's what I need,
and you can't give it to me.

And now, David Bowie is dead.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.507

Don't, don't, don't.

<i> We are at number 17.</i>

10:20.087 --> 10:22.053
<i> Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</i>

10:22.055 --> 10:23.889
Why are we watching this?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.724
[Jean] <i> ...five hurricanes</i>
<i> in the past three weeks,</i>

10:25.726 --> 10:27.726
<i> and it's still poppin'.</i>

10:27.728 --> 10:28.793
[Jean] <i> With the shoreline...</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:30.695
[June laughs]

10:30.697 --> 10:32.897
I took all the monitors down.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.034
Wait.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.103
You still have service
with those things down.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.170
I always thought
it was all connected.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.106
Oh, no. Two companies.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.407
Read all the manuals.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.842
Oh, oh.

10:43.844 --> 10:48.113
<i> We promise you won't find</i>
<i> any old millennials</i>

10:48.115 --> 10:49.748
<i> bothering you</i>
<i> at the clubs anymore.</i>

10:49.750 --> 10:50.815
<i> State of the art...</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:52.050
Oh, shut your mouth.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.019
[both laugh]

10:54.021 --> 10:57.055
-Who raised you?
-[laughing]

10:57.057 --> 11:00.358
Eat my fucking shorts.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.161
-Fool.
-[Sam] Screw yourself.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.614
[Jean Duncan]
<i> ...without pesky distractions,</i>

11:08.068 --> 11:09.234
<i> on eternal youth.</i>

11:10.937 --> 11:12.437
What about Fiji?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.122
Or Iceland?

11:14.123 --> 11:15.806
We could take the hyper loop
to Mexico.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.042
We could have tacos.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.943
Mm.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.446
What if we left earlier?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.381
[Sam] Get ourselves
a few extra days

11:23.383 --> 11:25.684
before you hit the big six-oh.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.887
[sighs]
I haven't packed.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.021
-[chair creaks]
-[groans]

11:30.023 --> 11:31.856
I never get used to that.

[device chimes]

11:34.961 --> 11:36.428
[beeping]

11:36.430 --> 11:38.897
Can you look at 29 across?

11:38.899 --> 11:40.932
Tell me what you think.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.966
From my experience, the answer
is always ...

11:42.969 --> 11:45.003
[scoffs]
Well, not this time.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.706
[sighs]

11:47.707 --> 11:49.207
I can't remember
anything anymore.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.710
You don't have to remember
anything, you got me.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.944
[June] Yeah, but it just...

11:54.448 --> 11:57.115
Things just slip away, you know?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.117
-[device chimes]
-Memories.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.753
There's not enough room.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.922
Push things out
like episodes of sitcoms.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.493
You know what, they say you're
supposed to live in the present,

12:08.495 --> 12:09.828
but how do ya...

12:11.498 --> 12:14.099
How do you hold on
to the present?

12:15.001 --> 12:17.035
I can't hold on to anything.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.106
I can't climb into it, Sam.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.876
It just slips
right through my fingers.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.745
[Sam] Breathe, honey.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.979
[Sam sighs]

12:27.981 --> 12:29.914
We gotta get away, we have to.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.253
I'm not as good as you.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.357
Let me take care of you.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.801
<i>¶ And they're giving me blooms ¶</i>

-Good morning.
-[Sam] <i> Can you go</i>

13:35.949 --> 13:37.515

13:39.185 --> 13:40.852

<i> for her garden?</i>

13:42.055 --> 13:43.888
I'm doing fine, Dad.
How are you?

13:45.826 --> 13:46.958
[Laura] <i> Dad?</i>

13:47.260 --> 13:48.893
<i> Dad?</i>

13:50.163 --> 13:51.996
<i> Yeah, I'll do those things.</i>

13:52.833 --> 13:54.365

14:06.947 --> 14:08.580
Thank you
for the flowers, honey.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.449
[Laura] No problem.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.317
Who's gonna appreciate them
once they're planted though?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.384
[clatters]

14:13.386 --> 14:15.854
[June] Oh. You never know.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.255
[Laura chuckles]

14:17.257 --> 14:19.290
It's all so romantic.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.327
You, Dad,
finally getting out of here.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.064
Oh, yeah. Very romantic.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.132
[Laura chuckling]

14:28.134 --> 14:30.101
You know,
I might be joining you soon.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.136
I thought I saw a wrinkle
the other day.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.606
Also, I'm getting jowly,
have you seen my jowls?

14:34.608 --> 14:37.108
Ooh, they better
lock you up for sure.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.276
[groans]

14:39.012 --> 14:40.144
[June sighs]

14:40.881 --> 14:42.580
[June] No.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.949
You have at least 30 more years

14:44.951 --> 14:47.285
-of civic productivity.
-[Laura snickers]

14:48.188 --> 14:49.921
[June] Here, take your pick.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.623
[Laura] Oh.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.658
[June] Here you go.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.594
What kinda jobs
are you looking for?

14:56.596 --> 14:59.364
Anything the employment office
assigns me.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.299
[Laura] I think
I can do a lot of things.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.936
I applied to be one
of those dog walkers.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.421
[June] Oh.

15:06.422 --> 15:07.905
They still don't trust machines
to do that.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.674
Lots of fresh air.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.441
Yeah, I just, I don't know
what the right fit is.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.413
I feel like
once I find the right job,

15:15.415 --> 15:17.749
everything will come together.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.084
I don't know if I ever
figured out what was right.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.087
You may not.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.323
Are you serious?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.326
I didn't even know
that was possible.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.527
[June] Oh, it's possible.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.196
Better to find

15:32.198 --> 15:34.032
what works for you
in that moment.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.166
And then,

15:35.168 --> 15:36.301
commit.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.203
I just don't want
to contribute to anything

15:39.205 --> 15:41.072
that could be harmful.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.209
There are too many cons
to every job.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.179
[Laura] Sometimes I'm so jealous
you guys get to just leave.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.024
Honey, I can't go.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.161
Because...

16:06.700 --> 16:08.399
Because Edward might come back.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.140
Usually, when they leave,

16:16.743 --> 16:18.176
they don't come back.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.344
[June] No, but, it's...

16:21.681 --> 16:25.083
You see,
it's the way he, he left.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.453
You understand me?
The way he left.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.456
He could come back.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.224
Anytime.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.428
[June] I remember...

16:37.430 --> 16:40.098
he told me I was quicker
than anyone else, once.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.302
That's a good one.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.237
[both chuckle]

16:47.741 --> 16:49.307
I remember jokes. I remember...

16:50.076 --> 16:51.409
his moles.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.281
I remember getting butterflies.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.150
You ever get butterflies?

17:01.287 --> 17:02.553
Uh, no.

maybe it's a break-in.

Okay, got it.
Stay where you are.

June? June!

[June] I'm here.

20:38.954 --> 20:40.504
[Sam] Yeah, I think
you better see this.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.639
[June] Is it safe?

Honestly, I'm, I'm not sure,

20:44.510 --> 20:46.711
but... I, I think
you better see this.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.383
[Sam] Excuse me.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.452
Hello?

20:57.624 --> 20:58.789
You there?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.396
He's alive.

Hey, hey, hey.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.767
Hey, whoa, whoa.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.568
[Sam] Where's the room with
the least amount of valuables?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.505
Put him in the bedroom.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.519
Edward.
[laughs]

22:37.623 --> 22:39.390
That was Edward?

22:44.831 --> 22:46.931
[humming]

22:51.404 --> 22:52.570
So...

22:53.406 --> 22:55.873
Let's say, he's your Edward,

22:55.875 --> 22:59.910
he then travelled through time
for you?

23:05.151 --> 23:07.885
This is unbelievable.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.554
How is he still young?

23:10.556 --> 23:12.823
[June] What if it's a wormhole?

23:12.825 --> 23:15.559
Then it's a rift in time
and space.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.529
So for him, it's one second,

23:18.531 --> 23:20.865
and for me, it's 24 years.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.668
Okay, so...

23:26.172 --> 23:27.772
[Sam blows air]

23:29.675 --> 23:32.410
What are our next steps?

23:33.679 --> 23:35.746
I don't know.
We ask him some questions?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.782
Questions. So...

23:38.885 --> 23:40.785
-We get to...
-[cork pops]

23:41.954 --> 23:43.621
know this fella.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.190
We figure out why he's here

23:46.192 --> 23:47.958
and then he disappears.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.595
I don't know if he disappears.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.465
Or if we want him to.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.735
[sighs]

23:57.737 --> 23:59.603
I mean, I woke up.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.572
And he was here.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.441
I've been thinking
about him for decades.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.209
Why now?

24:05.210 --> 24:06.976
Can you make
other things appear?

24:06.979 --> 24:08.646
[clicks tongue]

24:08.648 --> 24:10.714
Now you sound crazy.

24:10.716 --> 24:11.882
Oh, yeah.
I want an ice cream sundae,

24:11.884 --> 24:13.451
so I'm just gonna go boom.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.785
I don't think
you're a wizard, June.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.654
-However, you did say...
-[shushes]

24:16.656 --> 24:18.722
...you thought of him.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.224
And he appeared.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.859
I'm always thinking of him.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.496
Maybe I am a wizard.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.533
I mean, he must know something.

24:29.535 --> 24:30.968
Like, where he came from.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.972
[June] Unlock door.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.607
[door lock clicks]

24:37.677 --> 24:38.976
[door opens]

24:45.551 --> 24:46.851
Wake up.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.887
-Wake up!
-[Edward gasps]

24:55.895 --> 24:57.528
Where were you?

24:58.197 --> 24:59.897
[June] Where were you?

25:04.036 --> 25:05.636
Where am I?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.973
Where's June?
Where's all my stuff?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.710
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm...

25:12.712 --> 25:15.513
-I'm, I'm sorry, I just, I...
-Edward.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.715
Do you know, do you know,
do you know me?

25:17.717 --> 25:19.367
Huh?

25:19.368 --> 25:21.018
[Edward] I don't understand,
I don't know I got here.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.220
I was just...

25:23.222 --> 25:26.724
I think I'm having some sort
of a high-grade panic episode.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.792
And I, um...
[inhales deeply]

25:28.794 --> 25:30.928
[Edward] I don't know
where I came from. It's just...

25:31.531 --> 25:33.031
It...

25:33.032 --> 25:34.532
Sir, I don't know
how I ended up here.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.033
I was just in my house
with my girlfriend, and...

25:36.035 --> 25:37.935
And, um...
[pants]

25:39.272 --> 25:40.871
[Edward]
Maybe I should just, um...

25:40.873 --> 25:42.273
I, I, I should call the police.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.442
You know,
they might be able to help

25:44.443 --> 25:46.610
-if you just let me--
-You need to stay here.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.679
Until you have
some answers for me.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.583
-[June] Lock doors.
-[lock clicks]

25:53.753 --> 25:55.019

26:02.595 --> 26:04.662
He didn't recognize me.

[June] Yeah?

[Edward] I don't know
what's going on.

-Wait.

Oh.

Oh, you're stuck.

Uh, hello?

29:32.772 --> 29:34.037
Hello?

29:34.039 --> 29:35.906
Uh, I'm upstairs.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.777
Fuck. Uh, I'm Laura,

29:39.779 --> 29:41.211
your neighbor, can you hear me?

29:41.213 --> 29:44.081
[neighbor] Oh, shit, uh, hey.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.217
-I can hear you.
-Hey, there's a bird stuck.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.153
Can you help us?

29:49.155 --> 29:50.538
[neighbor] I see the bird.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.922
I'm not quite sure
what to do here.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.557
What can you see up there?

29:53.559 --> 29:56.193
Yeah, um, I think
the bird's wing is too big

29:56.195 --> 29:58.829
to fit through the opening.

29:58.831 --> 30:02.933
But I can't tell if it's injured
or stunned.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.168
[neighbor] Yeah.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.936
That's what I see too.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.505
It could have hit its head.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.141
Well, maybe if I,
maybe if I push its wing.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.844
-Ah.
-[neighbor] Uh, it can...

30:13.846 --> 30:15.979
Okay, just don't hurt it.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.098
-[neighbor grunting]
-[Laura clicks tongue]

30:18.099 --> 30:20.216
[neighbor] Its tiny legs,
I'm afraid I'll break them.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.820
Maybe you should be
pushing, uh, down,

30:22.822 --> 30:24.154
instead of me pushing up?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.090
Um...

30:28.093 --> 30:30.227
Okay, will you catch her?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.229
[neighbor]
Oh, it's a her now? Okay.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.998
Uh, uh, uh, wait, hold on.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.234
[Laura] We'll get you
out of this though, okay?

-Got it.
-[sighs]

30:50.850 --> 30:52.950
This never happened
at my old place.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.887
We had bugs, but not birds.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.389
Yeah, the hole
is news to me too.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.260
Did you leave your window open?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.862
No screens.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.165
How long you been here?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.366
A few weeks.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.103
It didn't really seem
like a place

31:13.105 --> 31:15.239
that you go
and ask someone for sugar.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.341
[chuckles]
Moving down in the world?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.377
[bird chirping]

31:22.081 --> 31:25.015
I was never really into birds.

31:25.017 --> 31:28.352
My dad's kinda girlfriend
is obsessed with her birdbath.

31:28.354 --> 31:32.155
Well, not the birdbath itself,
but the birds in the birdbath.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.291
She would have
really loved this girl.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.459
Or guy, I guess.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.898
Oh, don't tell.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.133
Don't tell what,
that you have a friend?

31:43.135 --> 31:44.668
Ah, well. No.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.204
Don't tell that she's in hiding.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.440
Now that I've said that part,
don't tell that part to anybody.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.642
-Oh, okay.
-[Laura] I mean,

31:51.644 --> 31:53.166
she's not really in hiding.

31:53.167 --> 31:54.689
I mean, she's technically
totally fine to be there.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.212
It's just it's gonna be
her 60th birthday

31:56.215 --> 31:58.181
in a few days, so...

31:58.183 --> 32:01.285
Oh, my god.
Why do I even open my mouth?

32:01.287 --> 32:03.086
We've been through
war together, today.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.321
You, you can trust me.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.926
Well, I guess you don't know
her first name or anything.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.060
[chuckles]

32:10.062 --> 32:13.363
[neighbor] Do you hang out
with her a lot?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.999
Yeah, every few days.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.201
Most of my friends
have moved out of town

32:18.203 --> 32:20.037
to start their families, so...

32:21.240 --> 32:23.473
I don't think
I know anyone over 45.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.077
Really?

32:27.079 --> 32:29.680
You know, Charles Darwin didn't
write <i> Origin of the Species</i>

32:29.682 --> 32:31.114
'til his early 50s.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.551
Well, we can't all be Darwin.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.487
No.
[laughs]

32:39.959 --> 32:43.060
So, she's hiding out,

32:43.062 --> 32:44.494
but she's not really hiding out

32:44.496 --> 32:47.297
because she's not yet 60.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.399
[neighbor]
So, how do you see her?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.103
I just go and I check on her.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.372
She lives in the hills.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.476
She doesn't believe
in the program.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.147
Neither do I.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.049
I mean, they don't get
to go outdoors.

33:06.051 --> 33:09.453
They don't get to socialize
with other ages.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.722
And all the medications
they take, I mean,

33:11.724 --> 33:14.124
a simple hike
could save a lot of money.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.692
Did you know that in the 1990s,

33:15.694 --> 33:18.228
they let them just
walk around all the time?

33:18.230 --> 33:19.696
[Laura] Like, even people
in their 80's.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.466
Just walking around.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.434
I mean, what do you get
with the program anyway?

33:24.436 --> 33:27.537
Just cell block housing
and regulated meals?

33:27.539 --> 33:29.206
Have you seen inside?

33:29.475 --> 33:32.009
No, but, um...

33:32.011 --> 33:34.277
my friend Christina had to drop
her great aunt there,

33:34.279 --> 33:36.213
and she told me how dark it was.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.148
And how catatonic
everyone looked.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.254
[neighbor] Bird's probably
not supposed to be here either.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.157
We're criminals already.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.292
Harboring a known fugitive bird.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.462
Bird's a secret.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.170
[both chuckle]

34:03.142 --> 34:04.441
Joint custody?

34:06.478 --> 34:07.611
Okay.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.257
Hey, man, I gotta talk to June.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.092
Not right now.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.061
We just need
to get some supplies.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.331
Hey, what's with you?
I'm not dangerous,

34:28.333 --> 34:30.132
you don't got to supervise me.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.668
[scoffs]
We don't know that.

34:33.539 --> 34:34.670
I know that.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.672
I don't know you.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.511
June, she knows me.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.480
June knew you.
[sighs]

34:43.482 --> 34:45.449
[stammering]
Let's...

34:45.451 --> 34:47.484
just give her some space, okay?

34:48.120 --> 34:49.351
We'll be back.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.355
[sighs]

34:52.357 --> 34:54.190

34:55.793 --> 34:58.195

grab me that jacket?

-Thank you very much.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.267
The one on the hook.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.303
Thanks.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.172
[sighs deeply]

35:09.842 --> 35:11.241
Um...

35:12.444 --> 35:14.578
So, she always
have something to say?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.613
Can't shut her up.

35:16.615 --> 35:21.518
[Sam] Though she did share
a great meatball recipe with me.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.354
I'm just saying,
she's not 100 percent evil.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.280
Where are you guys going?

We're not together, together.

all this time.

Everyone has their theories.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.240
Your parents thought
you were gallivanting off.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.442
My parents.
Wait, where are my parents?

36:19.444 --> 36:20.911
[Sam] I don't know.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.779
But they're over 60,
right? So...

36:24.416 --> 36:25.649
I may have some idea.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.252
What happens after 60?

36:28.253 --> 36:30.854
[automated voice]
<i> The Newton Company</i>

36:30.855 --> 36:33.456

36:42.668 --> 36:44.267
Wait.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.569
Is that why I'm here?

36:47.306 --> 36:48.505
It...

36:50.742 --> 36:52.442
Where'd you go,

36:52.444 --> 36:53.577
when you left?

36:55.914 --> 36:57.714
It only felt like a few seconds.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.107
You ever had that feeling

37:01.108 --> 37:02.864
when you're intensely
concentrating on something,

37:02.865 --> 37:04.621
and all of a sudden
you just snap out of it,

37:04.623 --> 37:07.224
and you realize
how much time's gone by?

37:10.362 --> 37:11.494
No.

37:26.278 --> 37:28.778
You put this in your ear.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.480
[sighs deeply]

37:33.485 --> 37:34.618
Other way.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.386
I got it.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.527
All right, so, how do I dial?

37:44.529 --> 37:46.079
[Sam] You remember
her full name?

37:46.080 --> 37:47.630
-Yeah.
-Then you just say it out loud.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.133
And if it's a common one,

37:49.134 --> 37:50.634
there's often
a few follow up questions.

37:50.636 --> 37:51.801
Okay.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.773
A lot of things have gotten
worse, but this is...

Okay.

[Sam] Edward can't come with us,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.972
He has to stay here.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.842
Our plan...

40:45.844 --> 40:49.179
was to leave tomorrow

through the...

41:23.248 --> 41:24.481
wormhole?

41:24.483 --> 41:25.682
It was a fight.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.750
[Edward] A fight?

41:28.687 --> 41:30.287
Was it a fight?

41:30.288 --> 41:31.888
[chuckling]
Yes, it was a fight.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.756
Yeah, you know, I,
I think I would,

41:33.758 --> 41:36.593
I'd call it more like
a disagreement.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.262
I was telling him,
very methodically,

41:39.264 --> 41:41.798
may I just remind you,

41:41.800 --> 41:44.934
of all the things that were
wrong in our relationship.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.970
Ahh.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.874
Yeah. Tell me more.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.877
I don't know. I felt like
we were travelling

41:53.879 --> 41:55.912
at different speeds sometimes.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.947
And I think...

41:57.949 --> 42:00.783
you needed to make a joke
out of everything.

42:00.785 --> 42:03.720
I mean, it was a great joke.
[chuckles]

42:03.722 --> 42:06.923
Yeah, but, your timing,
it's just horrific.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.224
Bad timing.

-What does David Bowie do--
-Okay, see?

See what I'm saying? Here we go.

42:13.497 --> 42:15.230
[Edward] Okay, so the joke
I was trying to tell that day--

42:15.233 --> 42:17.016
[June] No.

42:17.017 --> 42:18.800
What does David Bowie do
after the gym?

42:18.803 --> 42:20.069
[June] Oh, my god.
See what I'm saying?

42:20.539 --> 42:23.306
This...

42:23.307 --> 42:26.074
is the joke he travelled
through time and space to tell?

42:26.077 --> 42:27.577
This is it.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.078
Yeah, well, I didn't know
the circumstances

42:29.080 --> 42:30.813
when I originally told it.

42:32.751 --> 42:34.617
This is so weird.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.255
It's getting better.

-I'm sorry. Who, who's Laura?
-My daughter.

believe us.

Well, as long as the timing

Laura doesn't need to know.

What are their names?

51:30.488 --> 51:32.004
You know, that makes sense,

51:32.005 --> 51:33.521
'cause, uh, they'd be
all grown up now.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.227
Mm-hm.

51:41.499 --> 51:43.332
No, yeah, yeah.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.801
No, I get it.
That's a, that's a lot to be.

51:45.803 --> 51:47.503
You know, a mom
and a wife, and...

51:47.505 --> 51:49.371
you have kids, and...

51:51.175 --> 51:53.375
What about your, your,
um, your family?

51:53.377 --> 51:54.844
Your mom and dad?

51:54.846 --> 51:56.378
Do you still talk to them?

51:59.851 --> 52:01.317
Oh.

52:05.156 --> 52:06.222
Okay.

52:06.224 --> 52:08.741
Right, no. Yeah.

52:08.742 --> 52:11.259
Of course. You know,
I understand that that is, um...

52:11.262 --> 52:13.462
It's a difficult thing
to deal with, and, uh...

52:18.269 --> 52:20.402
Hey, uh, where are
you guys, uh, based at?

52:20.404 --> 52:22.538
Are you still living
in the same place? Up on...

52:24.408 --> 52:26.442
That's really far.
You guys moved?

52:29.680 --> 52:31.280
Right.

52:32.450 --> 52:33.682
No, that's...

52:34.418 --> 52:35.751
that's really good.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.625
Do you need anything?

52:44.529 --> 52:46.562
Do, do you need anything?

52:46.564 --> 52:49.498
I just, I know that that's
a weird thing to ask you,

52:49.500 --> 52:52.168
but if there's anything
I can do to help,

52:52.170 --> 52:54.436
um, I would love to...

52:55.173 --> 52:56.605
No, I can call you back.

52:59.944 --> 53:01.627
I just, I could...

53:01.628 --> 53:03.311
I could call you,
and then, you could...

53:06.651 --> 53:07.783
Listen.

53:10.321 --> 53:12.454
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

53:12.456 --> 53:14.723
I just, I just want you to know
that wherever he is...

53:16.427 --> 53:17.760
he's okay.

53:21.499 --> 53:22.631
You too.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.402
Okay, you too.

53:35.346 --> 53:36.512
[sighs]

53:43.321 --> 53:45.254
[June] I like your hair down.

53:45.957 --> 53:47.356
No.

53:47.358 --> 53:48.524
[June] No?

53:50.228 --> 53:52.628
[sighs]
I don't know how this happened.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.396
[June] How what happened?

53:54.398 --> 53:56.465
[sighs]
It's just my hair,

53:56.467 --> 53:58.234
it's thinning.

53:58.636 --> 54:00.369
Let me see.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.773
[June] Oh, that's not bad.

54:05.776 --> 54:08.377
No one my age has this.

54:09.513 --> 54:12.615
[groans]
I don't know, I just feel manly,

54:12.617 --> 54:14.950
and like, gross.

54:14.952 --> 54:18.354
Nobody else sees that, but you.

54:18.356 --> 54:20.990
Yeah, but I know it's there.
[sniffles]

54:20.992 --> 54:23.626
And I know that most women
have, like, 50 years

54:23.628 --> 54:25.461
before their hair falls out,

54:25.463 --> 54:28.030
or thins, or balds.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.699
Ugh. I just hate
that word, "balds."

54:33.037 --> 54:34.637
See this?

54:34.639 --> 54:35.971
[Laura] Uh-huh.

54:35.973 --> 54:39.041
I wear either a Band-Aid
or a sweater,

54:39.043 --> 54:41.277
or both. Every day.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.580
-Why?
-Birthmark.

54:44.582 --> 54:46.615
-A birthmark?
-Yes.

54:46.617 --> 54:49.551
Okay, I have literal death
on my head.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.537
So...

54:51.538 --> 54:53.288
-[June] Don't be ridiculous.
-[scoffs]

54:53.291 --> 54:56.492
A ponytail is a perfectly normal
thing to wear on your head.

54:56.494 --> 55:00.529
Consider 40 summers
of long-sleeved shirts.

55:00.531 --> 55:02.498
-Seriously.
-[chuckles]

55:02.499 --> 55:04.466
And dozens of excuses
at the ready

55:04.468 --> 55:08.504
as to why I am wearing a bandage
on my arm at the beach.

55:08.506 --> 55:10.439
[sniffles]
Yeah, okay.

55:10.441 --> 55:12.041
[June] Yeah?

55:12.043 --> 55:14.376
You know how much
I love Bowie, right?

55:14.578 --> 55:16.095
Mm-hm.

55:16.096 --> 55:17.613
Okay, he was all about flaws.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.548
The guy had a weird eye.

55:19.550 --> 55:22.785
He had, I mean, messed up teeth.

55:22.787 --> 55:24.553
-[chuckles]
-Yeah?

55:24.555 --> 55:26.622
Totally badass.

55:26.624 --> 55:29.425
I mean, yeah, he was.

55:31.028 --> 55:34.330
Then again, he didn't have
a birthmark, did he?

55:34.332 --> 55:35.831
He also wasn't balding.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.401
-And he got his teeth fixed.
-Yes.

55:39.403 --> 55:41.437
-Didn't he?
-Yeah.

55:41.438 --> 55:43.472
-So what am I talking about?
-I don't know. Forget him.

55:45.609 --> 55:46.642
[chuckles]

55:48.045 --> 55:50.879
Give me help with the... yeah.
Oh, my god.

55:53.584 --> 55:54.717
Hm.

55:58.889 --> 56:01.490
[approaching footsteps]

56:01.492 --> 56:03.525
[June] Sam! Over here.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.528
Hey.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.497
You're looking good.

56:08.499 --> 56:09.765
Right on pace.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.500
[scoffs]
Sure.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.136
Come over here.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.904
I don't want you to miss this.

56:17.408 --> 56:18.907
[sighs deeply]

56:30.621 --> 56:34.790
That bird is the only one
that comes out at night.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.924
[sighs]

56:39.397 --> 56:41.430
I think it's hiding.

56:48.873 --> 56:50.973
I don't wanna leave without you.

59:17.955 --> 59:19.087
I got one.

59:23.794 --> 59:24.927
Okay.

59:28.299 --> 59:30.332
[neighbor] These things
just kick right in, right?

59:30.334 --> 59:32.301

-[Laura] I think so.

59:32.303 --> 59:34.770
Okay, yeah.

59:34.772 --> 59:36.972
[Edward] So you guys are going
to Mexico?

59:37.741 --> 59:38.941
But...

59:39.577 --> 59:41.276
I just got here.

[Edward grunts]

59:46.584 --> 59:47.716
[sighs]

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:05.701
[June] Do you think...

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.137
'cause you came here,

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.943
could we go back there?

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.015
[warbling]

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.918

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:25.954
if it closes
and I don't come back?

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:31.326
From everything I've seen
in this place...

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:32.894
it would be better if you don't.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:35.163
-Right?
-Yeah.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.099
Let's go.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:38.667
Okay.

[Edward grunting]

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.748
-[Edward] We're compatible!
-Okay!

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.918
How do you even know anyway?

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.987
[both groan]

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.705

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:19.675
I just do.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.209
[young June] Okay.
Well, I don't. Okay?

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.978
I don't know that.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.214
And that is why I need
the grand gesture.

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.895
[Edward] Uh...

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:42.698
Can you just give me an example?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.068
I won't do that one. I'll just
do something like it. I promise.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.170
[young June] No, see that's
exactly what I'm saying.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:50.238
I just...

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.109
I need you to be able to like,
read my mind sometimes.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:56.912
[Edward] I just, I can't,
I can't do that, June.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.714
[young June] Well, like,
that's what I need.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:00.782
And you can't give it to me.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:02.718
And now, David Bowie is dead.
[sobs]

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.120
[Edward] Oh, please, please,
don't, don't, don't.

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:09.257

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.160
What?

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:14.096
What?

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:18.233
Edward!

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.036
[gloomy music]

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.820
[young June] Edward!

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:06.915
June?

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.851
[sighs]

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.189
Oh, my god. Here she is.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:25.267
Edward. Edward! Oh, my god!

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:28.203
Holy crap! What was that?
Did you see that?

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.071
[Edward] Yeah. Hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.339
I'm back, I'm here, and...

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.408
I'm sorry.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.011
I'm so sorry.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:39.515
[June] Oh.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.817
Oh, hello, new person
in my living room.

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.084
Hi there.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:47.355
-I'm... Who are you?
-[Edward] Uh, she's...

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.891
Uh, she's an old friend.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.297
What? I mean, what...
I mean, what...

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.165
What was that?
Was I hallucinating?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.202
Um, no. It's a really
long story.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:02.137
Uh, I promise
I'll tell you later.

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:05.140
Tell me about it later?
Tell me now, you dick.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.576
[chuckles]

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:11.379
[Edward] Uh, what happened
is, uh...

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.082
I met... Uh, we...

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:18.320
-We--
-I'm sorry I'm intruding.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:20.989
[June] You have a very
lovely home.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:27.229
Is that a jewelry kit?

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:31.233
[June] You know
we really need to...

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.335
I mean, can we do this
another time with your friend?

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.603
-I don't...
-[Edward] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.404
[June] Gosh, this is lovely.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.473
So, you make jewelry then?

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:42.577
Uh, yeah, um...

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.613
Yeah I started just
a couple of weeks ago,

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.248
actually just, um...

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.383
collecting different charms
and things.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.019
I thought maybe I'd,
I don't know,

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.287
make a bracelet or something.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.488
Sure.
[chuckles]

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:57.425
Where do you find these,
these charms?

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:00.662
Um, different places.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:04.432
You know, um, estate sales
are good, uh...

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.434
-Garage sales.
-Mm.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.409
Where did you find this one?

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.512
This one, um...

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.382
Uh, this one, um,

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:22.284
-this funny old man...
-Ah.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.352
-...just down the street.
-Sure.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.021
-[young June] Yeah.
-Oh.

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:29.457
Oh.
[sighs]

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:32.260
You know, uh...

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.297
I saw it happen.

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:38.133
I just happened to be
on my way over.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:41.403
You... you saw him disappear?

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.104
-[June] I did.
-[gasps]

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.040
[chuckles]

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.943
I mean, what, like,
what was that, right?

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.244
-Like what?
-[June] Well...

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.380
I think when David Bowie died,

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:54.349
the universe broke.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.356
That's exactly right.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.458
Yeah.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.260
[young June]
It makes perfect sense.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:08.730
And I wasn't hallucinating.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.298
I don't think so.

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:16.371
The world did feel really
different when he died.

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:17.973
I told you.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:20.976
-I told him.
-[chuckles]

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.111
I bet.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.446
Well...

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:27.349
I should, I should go.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.537
Goodbye, Edward.

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:04.019
Gosh, you're so pretty.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.392
Take care.

We're moving.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:32.147
I mean, I can't, I can't...

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:34.616
-[laughing]
-[June] Oh, my god.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:53.668
Hey.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:07.615

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.418

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.225
[Sam] Come on, little fella.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.495
Could be a girl bird.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.430
Little fella-ette.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.238
Do you remember
being a teenager?

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:34.642
Not really.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.481
I remember the cars.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.484
I do.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:49.691
I remember the first time
I sat next to a boy.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.392
Like this.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.265
<i>[June]We sat next to each other</i>
<i> at a movie.</i>

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.236
<i> It was the first date</i>
<i> I ever went on.</i>

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.439
He was looking at the screen,

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:08.843
with almost his entire fist
in his mouth,

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.478
picking his teeth.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.180
[chuckles]
I remember popcorn.

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:16.216
And I couldn't imagine...

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.154
<i> that he thought about me.</i>

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.291
[June] <i> That he wanted me.</i>

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.760
<i> That...</i>

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:31.198
<i> He had any intentions at all</i>

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:32.433
<i> about me.</i>

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.578
How did it all work out?

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.688
We're not together,
Edward and me.

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:59.260
Oh.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.597
Why not?

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:05.600
He ruined my life.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:11.773
[chuckles]

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:15.910
Not his fault, really.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:17.545
David Bowie's fault.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:20.481
[chuckles]

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.753
I believe you.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.674
[sighs]

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.555
Well, I guess I...

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.523
better pack.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:06.527
-Hmm?
-[chuckles]

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:08.830
Yeah, we'll pack soon.

Yeah.
