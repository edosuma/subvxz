[Star] Now that Seahorse is in
prison for Queennapping Eclipsa,

00:04.911 --> 00:06.791
Ponyhead thinks
he's hot again.

00:06.791 --> 00:08.461
But he's in jail.

00:08.461 --> 00:09.621
They're never
going to see each other!

-Hey! Glossaryck!

00:12.541 --> 00:13.661
Glossaryck!

00:13.661 --> 00:15.121
What?!

00:15.121 --> 00:16.331
What are you doing?!

00:16.331 --> 00:19.661
Uh, shopping for antiques.

00:19.661 --> 00:22.001
No, you're not!
This stuff is mine!

00:22.001 --> 00:23.961
This is my secrets closet.

00:23.961 --> 00:25.791
You don't get
to shop in here!

00:25.791 --> 00:28.581
Ohhh! Oh, I get it.

00:28.581 --> 00:30.621
You-- You think
that I'm the only person

00:30.621 --> 00:32.751
who takes things
out of your closet.

00:32.751 --> 00:34.331
[laughing]

00:34.331 --> 00:36.331
[laughing harder]

00:36.331 --> 00:38.751
What are you talking about?

[laughing]

00:43.411 --> 00:44.461
[gasp]

00:46.621 --> 00:48.041
Oh, no!

00:49.751 --> 00:51.121
The book piece
is missing!

00:51.121 --> 00:53.161
Who would need--

00:53.161 --> 00:55.081
[gasp] Eclipsa!

01:08.701 --> 01:10.001
Whoop!

01:23.291 --> 01:24.831
[gasp]

01:38.041 --> 01:39.291
[laughs]

01:39.291 --> 01:40.701
Oh, you.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.751
What took you so long?

01:42.751 --> 01:45.291
I had to find the perfect box
for your gift.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.871
Oh, no, no, wait!

01:46.871 --> 01:49.331
I'm taking you
to a secret place.

01:50.331 --> 01:51.461

[scraping]

01:57.291 --> 01:59.121
Globgor, dear.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.501
Oh! Yeah, of course.

02:02.501 --> 02:04.291
Ha ha!

02:04.291 --> 02:06.161
Whoop!

02:06.161 --> 02:08.161
Oh, I like
your earrings.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.161
Thank you. They're new.

02:11.701 --> 02:14.661
Wow. It's so peaceful
out today.

02:14.661 --> 02:16.541
I know.

02:16.541 --> 02:18.751
No unsuspecting fishermen,

02:18.751 --> 02:20.701
no beefy loggers.

02:20.701 --> 02:23.251
I don't even hear
any miners.

02:23.251 --> 02:24.911
Too bad.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.831
I used to get so many rubies
stuck in my teeth.

02:27.831 --> 02:31.371
[laughing] If I'd kept eating
those miners, I'd be rich!

02:31.371 --> 02:33.161
Ha ha ha!

02:33.161 --> 02:35.501
It's a joke!
It's a joke!

02:35.501 --> 02:37.161
'Cause I'd never eat
another Mewman,

02:37.161 --> 02:39.751
even if it made me rich!
Hee hee!

02:39.751 --> 02:42.461
Uh, that was
a terrible joke.

02:42.461 --> 02:45.041
But you are
a very good vegetarian.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.701
Yeah. Well,
it took me a while
to get the hang of it.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.701
You thought leeks
were the same as leeches.

02:50.701 --> 02:52.461
I mean, they
still sound the same.

02:52.461 --> 02:54.791
I mean, leeks, leech.
Leeks, leech, you know?

02:54.791 --> 02:57.661
And you thought potatoes
were a type of rock!

02:57.661 --> 02:59.791
It's a miracle you said
yes to a second date.

02:59.791 --> 03:03.461
Well, by then,
I'd made up my mind anyway.

03:03.461 --> 03:04.541
[bump]

03:06.461 --> 03:07.501
My Lady.

03:07.501 --> 03:09.041
Don't call me that.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.831
Can we do
the shoulder thing?

03:12.791 --> 03:13.961
Whoaaa!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.831
Wheee!

03:15.831 --> 03:17.251
Ha ha ha!

03:19.751 --> 03:21.541
So exhilarating!

03:21.541 --> 03:22.751
Okay, my turn!

03:22.751 --> 03:24.831
Oh, all right.

03:24.831 --> 03:28.621
[both]
One, two, three!

03:33.791 --> 03:35.621
Yeah!

03:35.621 --> 03:36.751
Whoo!

03:39.411 --> 03:41.791
Ahh! How'd you know
that was there?

03:41.791 --> 03:43.961

Wait. Where is everything?

05:07.461 --> 05:10.541
I had a picnic basket
and a lawn blanket.

05:10.541 --> 05:13.331
I made salads
and lemonade!

05:13.331 --> 05:15.541
Who--
Who would've done this?

05:15.541 --> 05:17.371
I bet it was those miners.

Greedy little buggers!

Come out!

Oh, dear.

Ha! You thought
it was a miner, huh?

It's beautiful.

05:59.791 --> 06:03.041
Yeah.
Too bad it's not real.

06:03.961 --> 06:06.161
How long have you known?

06:06.161 --> 06:09.041
Well, I mean, this place
is usually crawling
with Mewmans.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.661
Where are the Mewmans?

06:10.661 --> 06:12.961
And then there's that.

06:12.961 --> 06:15.961
[heroic fanfare]

06:15.961 --> 06:18.411
What... is it?

06:18.411 --> 06:21.461
That's Bananahat Musclewhale.

06:21.461 --> 06:24.581
I'm afraid
I don't know who that is.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.251
[Globgor]
Bananahat Musclewhale
was the last crusader

06:26.251 --> 06:28.661
against the evil tyranny
of Lord Rygax,

06:28.661 --> 06:30.961
Wizard Overlord
of the kingdom.

06:30.961 --> 06:33.541
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

06:33.541 --> 06:35.041
Lord Rygax?

06:35.041 --> 06:36.251
Yeah, but listen.

06:36.251 --> 06:37.661
Bananahat Musclewhale
was unprepared

06:37.661 --> 06:39.121
for the Enchanted Skaddlings

06:39.121 --> 06:42.081
that Rygax mind-controlled
to do his bidding,

06:42.081 --> 06:44.751
and Bananahat fell
to their awesome powers,

06:44.751 --> 06:48.961
leaving Lord Rygax to run
the kingdom into darkness...

06:48.961 --> 06:50.581
forever.

06:50.581 --> 06:53.371
I missed this part
of Mewni history.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.871
This isn't Mewni history.

06:54.871 --> 06:56.251
It's from my mind!

06:56.251 --> 06:58.621
I created Bananahat
when I was a little boy.

06:58.621 --> 07:00.831
Oh. Makes sense.

07:00.831 --> 07:06.081
Wait. Are we
in my mind right now?

07:06.081 --> 07:07.411
Yes.

07:07.411 --> 07:08.501
Ohh!

07:08.501 --> 07:09.961
That's creepy, boo!

07:09.961 --> 07:11.911
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

07:11.911 --> 07:14.001
Well, I am, but I don't
wanna be in my mind!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.291
I mean, where's my body?

07:16.291 --> 07:20.041
Your body is still
trapped inside of one
of Rhombulus' crystals.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.251
Bummer.

07:21.251 --> 07:23.001
Then where are you?

07:23.001 --> 07:27.041
Well, I'm free, basically.

07:27.041 --> 07:29.411
So how'd you get in here?

07:29.411 --> 07:30.911
I used a spell.

07:30.911 --> 07:33.121
And, uh, Meteora?

07:33.121 --> 07:35.041
She's wonderful!

07:35.041 --> 07:38.081
She has my eyes
and your beautiful fangs,

07:38.081 --> 07:40.331
and she just learned
how to crawl on the ceiling!

07:40.331 --> 07:42.251
That's adorable!

07:42.251 --> 07:45.251
It's less adorable
when she vomits
from up there.

07:45.251 --> 07:47.041
That's my girl!

07:47.041 --> 07:49.081
I wish I could see her.

07:49.081 --> 07:50.081
You can.

07:50.081 --> 07:51.201
What do you mean?

07:51.201 --> 07:53.001
Mm!

07:53.001 --> 07:55.501
My mother created a spell
that'll break your crystal,

07:55.501 --> 07:57.121
and I've done
all of the steps,

07:57.121 --> 07:58.621
except for the last.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.621
All that's left is for me
to pull the ribbon

08:02.621 --> 08:05.371
from the beak of this rooster
to make it crow.

08:05.371 --> 08:07.291
Then you'll be set free.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.161
You're so weird.

08:09.161 --> 08:11.581
Are you ready
to see your daughter?

08:11.581 --> 08:14.081
Of course!
But I don't know.

08:14.081 --> 08:17.201
I mean, don't the Mewmans
still hate me?

08:17.201 --> 08:19.661
You're... controversial.

08:19.661 --> 08:21.291
Even if the people
let me come back,

08:21.291 --> 08:23.121
they'd just be waiting
for me to mess up.

08:23.121 --> 08:26.161
And maybe I'm still
not over what happened.

08:26.161 --> 08:28.541
Maybe I'd prove them
right somehow.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.251
I want you with us.

08:30.251 --> 08:31.961
Can you tell me
without a doubt

08:31.961 --> 08:34.161
that the kingdom
is ready for me?

08:34.161 --> 08:36.661
[sigh] I don't know.

08:36.661 --> 08:39.161
When the kingdom is ready,
you'll know.

08:39.161 --> 08:41.911
Then maybe
I'll be ready, too?

08:41.911 --> 08:44.041
I hate it
when you're right.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.121
[sigh]

09:04.121 --> 09:06.911
So looks like
the book is back.

09:06.911 --> 09:08.961
Oh! You got
Glossaryck's silkworms

09:08.961 --> 09:10.291
sliming it back together!

09:10.291 --> 09:11.871
And what do ya know?

09:11.871 --> 09:14.291
It's turned to that
Crystal Pulverizing Spell.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.911
Star, I can explain.

09:15.911 --> 09:17.081
So when's he coming out?

09:17.081 --> 09:20.161
He's not. He's not ready.

09:20.161 --> 09:22.201
The kingdom isn't ready.

09:22.201 --> 09:24.001
Yeah, no doi!

09:24.001 --> 09:26.251
You stole that piece
of the book from my closet.

09:26.251 --> 09:27.871
Yes.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.251
[sigh] How did you
even know it was there?

09:30.251 --> 09:33.541
I may have gone
inside your mind.

09:33.541 --> 09:36.751
That is...
so creepy, Eclipsa.

09:36.751 --> 09:39.121
Yes, people
keep saying that.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.121
Is there any way
you can forgive me?

09:41.121 --> 09:44.661
Are you seriously worried
about what I think?

09:44.661 --> 09:48.291
Eclipsa, why don't
you ever worry about
what your people think?

09:48.291 --> 09:51.871
My people? They haven't even
given me a proper coronation.

09:51.871 --> 09:53.251
That's your excuse?

09:53.251 --> 09:54.331
Okay, fine.

09:54.331 --> 09:55.831
I'll give you a coronation.

09:55.831 --> 09:56.831
What?

09:56.831 --> 09:58.201
Yup. That's right.

09:58.201 --> 09:59.581
Then they'll
have to accept you,

09:59.581 --> 10:01.501
and you will
have to lead them.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.081
Maybe then you'll think twice

10:03.081 --> 10:05.001
before you get up to
all this witchy stuff again.

10:05.001 --> 10:06.371
[sigh]

10:06.371 --> 10:09.251
Yes, I suppose you're right.

10:09.251 --> 10:11.371
I know what it's like to miss
someone when...

10:11.371 --> 10:13.371
when you love them.

10:13.371 --> 10:15.291
You do crazy things.

10:16.751 --> 10:19.251
All right.
