00:00.102 --> 00:01.701
Previously on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:01.726 --> 00:04.226
I just got some <i>really</i> bad news.

00:04.251 --> 00:05.951
Is it medical in nature?

00:05.976 --> 00:08.276
Just... don't say a thing to Evan, okay?

00:08.301 --> 00:09.501
Please...

00:09.526 --> 00:10.826
I'm pregnant.

00:10.951 --> 00:12.651
You're going to be a father.

00:12.702 --> 00:16.171
I promised myself that
this disease would die with me.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.640
I gotta figure out my next move.

00:18.642 --> 00:20.775
- Dad...
- What?

00:20.777 --> 00:23.745
You're going to prison.

Whoa! You missed a ball.

00:48.071 --> 00:50.171
- Go get it.
- Ready, here it comes.

00:50.173 --> 00:53.174
[Chatter, laughter]

00:56.546 --> 00:58.513
- First day?
- Me?

00:58.515 --> 01:00.482
- Yeah.
- No.

01:00.484 --> 01:02.017
I'm an old-timer.

01:02.019 --> 01:04.185
Oh, yeah, I'm hardened.

01:04.187 --> 01:05.519
- Oh, hardened?
- Hardened.

01:05.522 --> 01:06.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06.757 --> 01:08.056
Then why have I been here eight months

01:08.058 --> 01:09.591
I've never seen you once?

01:11.594 --> 01:13.895
All right, so... maybe I'm new.

01:13.897 --> 01:15.830
Don't tell anybody, okay?

01:15.832 --> 01:18.033
You know, technically,
I should not be here.

01:18.035 --> 01:19.901
Oh, yeah. No, me neither.

01:19.903 --> 01:21.603
I totally didn't do anything wrong.

01:21.605 --> 01:22.804
- There you go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.806 --> 01:25.941
Eddie R. Lawson.

01:25.943 --> 01:28.076
- I'm Shaw.
- Shaw?

01:28.078 --> 01:29.411
What kind of name is Shaw?

01:29.413 --> 01:32.213
What kind of name is Eddie, Eddie?

01:32.215 --> 01:33.682
It's like talking to my sons.

01:33.684 --> 01:35.150
They must be good-looking sons.

01:35.152 --> 01:36.918
I wanna tell you.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.154
So...

01:39.156 --> 01:42.624
do you have any advice
on how to survive in the clank?

01:42.626 --> 01:45.727
[Whistle] Move it along.

01:45.729 --> 01:48.930
- For starters...
- Form a line at the flagpole!

01:48.932 --> 01:50.298
- ...don't call it the clank.
- Yeah.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.668
- Let's go, let's go!
- Keep to yourself.

01:53.670 --> 01:58.206
If somebody's in trouble,
not your problem.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.609
Make a line at the flagpole, let's go!

02:00.611 --> 02:02.711
[Sighs]

02:02.713 --> 02:04.379
Well, maybe you could introduce me

02:04.381 --> 02:06.615
to some of your friends.

02:06.617 --> 02:08.650
- Friends?
- Yeah.

02:08.651 --> 02:11.219
Why would I make friends here?

02:11.221 --> 02:14.222
They're all a bunch of criminals.

02:22.565 --> 02:24.766
You sure you don't wanna
report who did that to you?

02:24.768 --> 02:27.135
I told you, man. I slipped in my cell.

02:27.137 --> 02:29.771
We'll miss you around here.

02:29.773 --> 02:32.007
Don't know what the guards
are gonna do for tech support.

02:32.009 --> 02:35.410
Well, they'll call India,
like everyone else.

02:35.412 --> 02:38.279
Don't worry, I'll still
take your calls, Bill.

02:38.281 --> 02:41.383
Good luck, Shaw. Not that you'll need it.

02:54.096 --> 02:55.263
Are you all right?

02:59.068 --> 03:01.069
Do you know where the nearest church is?

03:01.071 --> 03:03.638
When did you find religion?

03:03.640 --> 03:06.274
It found me.

03:06.276 --> 03:08.777
Baptists are a couple miles that way.

03:08.779 --> 03:11.246
But your first stop ought to be a hospital,

03:11.248 --> 03:15.884
- you don't look so hot.
- I'm good.

03:15.886 --> 03:17.786
I just need to get to Austin.

03:17.788 --> 03:20.622
- Got a girl there?
- Yeah, I do.

03:20.624 --> 03:25.427
Listen, there's a guy in there
who might be in danger of...

03:25.429 --> 03:27.529
- of slipping.
- Let me guess.

03:27.531 --> 03:29.931
- Your buddy Lawson.
- Keep an eye on him.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.733
I'll make it up to you next time

03:31.735 --> 03:34.736
spyware hijacks your homepage.

03:42.611 --> 03:45.747
So I just had a thought.

03:45.749 --> 03:48.249
What if dad won't see us?

03:48.251 --> 03:50.585
I mean, he did ask us not to come, right?

03:50.587 --> 03:53.955
- Yeah.
- Maybe he can't see us.

03:53.957 --> 03:55.256
What if he's in solitary?

03:55.258 --> 03:57.058
Evan, we have to be
the adults here, okay?

03:57.060 --> 03:58.426
And not just today.

03:58.428 --> 04:00.428
If things go well at
the parole hearing on Monday,

04:00.430 --> 04:02.330
we'll have to start
being the adults every day.

04:02.332 --> 04:04.199
What do you mean by "the adults"?

04:04.201 --> 04:07.302
- Dad being in prison...
- Correctional institution!

04:07.304 --> 04:09.404
Whatever. It's been hard for us.

04:09.406 --> 04:11.239
But being out might be hard for him.

04:11.241 --> 04:13.341
I mean, once we vouch for him,
it'll be our job

04:13.343 --> 04:14.776
to get him back to the Hamptons, and...

04:14.778 --> 04:15.544
Here you go.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.011
...keep him on the straight and narrow.

04:17.012 --> 04:20.014
Straight and narrow. Got it.

04:32.828 --> 04:35.130
Well, it ain't exactly <i>Oz</i>, that's for sure.

04:35.132 --> 04:38.233
New faces! Don't think we met.

04:38.235 --> 04:40.001
It's our first visit to the prison.

04:40.003 --> 04:43.104
- Oh, correctional institution.
- I told you... I told him that.

04:43.106 --> 04:44.873
Hank Lawson, and my brother Evan.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.374
Oh, Lawson's boys.

04:46.376 --> 04:47.909
You must've come for
your dad's parole hearing.

04:47.911 --> 04:50.411
Yes, we did. And we are totally ready

04:50.413 --> 04:52.514
to keep him on the straight and
narrow, if you know what I mean.

04:52.516 --> 04:53.815
Not to say that you
haven't rehabilitated him,

04:53.817 --> 04:55.283
'cause I'm sure you guys...

04:55.285 --> 04:57.852
Once he got the jitters
out, he did okay here.

04:57.854 --> 04:59.921
So he'll have your support
on the parole board?

04:59.923 --> 05:01.422
Oh, I don't sit on the board.

05:01.424 --> 05:03.057
But your dad has a shot.

05:03.059 --> 05:05.393
Long as his alternative
custody is going smoothly.

05:05.395 --> 05:07.028
That's where most of them blow it.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.464
Uh, I'm sorry, alternative custody?

05:09.466 --> 05:11.099
Home detention program.

05:11.101 --> 05:12.834
Qualified with good behavior.

05:12.836 --> 05:15.303
Gets to sleep in a house, work a real job.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.504
Been out three weeks.

05:16.506 --> 05:18.540
Been out three... home detention?

05:18.542 --> 05:20.008
At whose home?

05:20.010 --> 05:21.442
Well, he found a sponsor in Palm Beach.

05:21.444 --> 05:24.212
Okay, and where is he working?

05:24.214 --> 05:26.114
Well, his lawyer will know more.

05:26.116 --> 05:28.850
Excuse me, fellas. Nice meeting you.

05:28.852 --> 05:30.451
Yeah.

05:30.453 --> 05:32.587
That's funny, dad never
mentioned home detention.

05:32.589 --> 05:34.022
No, he sure didn't.

05:34.024 --> 05:36.324
He said, "I don't want you
to see me like this."

05:36.326 --> 05:39.127
And I'll bet he doesn't.

That's quite a story.

06:23.489 --> 06:25.489
I don't know whether to say
"tmi" or "tell me more."

06:25.491 --> 06:27.157

06:27.159 --> 06:29.960
All right. We'll see you soon, Nola.

06:29.962 --> 06:31.261
Great.

06:31.263 --> 06:34.264
[Laughing] Oh, my God.

06:38.903 --> 06:41.572
So just 'cause we're
in Florida doesn't mean

06:41.574 --> 06:44.975
that you have to drive
like an old lady, you know.

06:44.977 --> 06:46.410
I don't know why you're so upset,

06:46.412 --> 06:48.078
you said we'd have to be the adults.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.914
Yeah, I just didn't think
we'd have to start so soon.

06:50.916 --> 06:52.583
Okay, so what did dad's lawyer say?

06:52.585 --> 06:55.385
She said he's busing tables at
a place outside Palm Beach.

06:55.387 --> 06:57.087
- What?
- She's gonna meet us there.

06:57.089 --> 07:00.858
And her name is Nola 'cause
she was conceived in New Orleans

07:00.860 --> 07:04.828
- during Mardi Gras.
- Okay.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.064
I noticed you were
getting a little flirty there.

07:07.066 --> 07:08.899
That was not flirty.

07:08.901 --> 07:11.168
- That was chatty.
- Okay.

07:11.170 --> 07:13.203
- All right.
- I'm taken.

07:13.205 --> 07:14.838
I'm very taken.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.709
- I am very, very...
- Evan.

07:18.711 --> 07:20.711
Okay, are you sitting down?

07:20.713 --> 07:22.546
All right, I wanted to tell
you and dad at the same time,

07:22.548 --> 07:24.848
but since you insist...

07:24.850 --> 07:26.517
I got some pretty big news, okay?

07:26.519 --> 07:30.053
Okay.

07:30.055 --> 07:33.690
I'm gonna propose to Paige.

07:33.692 --> 07:39.530
And I wanna use mom's ring.

07:39.532 --> 07:41.331
That's great, Evan.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.801
No, I... I... I... I think that's great.

07:43.803 --> 07:45.936
Really? 'Cause you kinda

07:45.938 --> 07:48.372
took your time
coming up with the word there.

07:48.374 --> 07:51.308
No, look, look, I'm not
saying don't propose, you know?

07:51.310 --> 07:53.177
I'm just saying...

07:53.179 --> 07:56.380
before you give her mom's ring,
make sure you really know her.

07:56.382 --> 07:57.881
You know, be fully bonded.

07:57.883 --> 07:59.950
I think I know her pretty well.

07:59.952 --> 08:03.086
I mean... her dad shot me in the ass.

08:03.088 --> 08:04.588
That's pretty bonding.

08:04.590 --> 08:06.723
Look, I'm just trying to help, okay?

08:06.725 --> 08:09.059
Yeah, maybe I wasn't
looking for your help, doctor,

08:09.061 --> 08:11.929
I was more looking for
your support as my brother.

08:11.931 --> 08:14.865
But...

08:14.867 --> 08:16.767
And would you please drive faster?

08:16.769 --> 08:19.770
Boats are passing us.

08:38.056 --> 08:40.057
Can I help you with that, Dr. Caseras?

08:40.058 --> 08:42.025
I'm sorry for intruding so early.

08:42.027 --> 08:43.927
Oh, Hank said that you might stop by.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.897
I just wanna check the positioning.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.538
Everything looks fine.

08:54.540 --> 08:57.074
So I heard you're in charge for a few days.

08:57.076 --> 08:59.576
- How does it feel?
- Oh, it's no big deal.

08:59.578 --> 09:02.045
Hank is available by phone.

09:04.315 --> 09:06.683
- Quite a healthy baby.
- Yes.

09:06.685 --> 09:08.919
I'd hope for a natural delivery,

09:08.921 --> 09:10.354
but if this baby gets any bigger,

09:10.356 --> 09:12.456
I may have to run to Hamptons Heritage

09:12.458 --> 09:13.924
and beg for them to induce.

09:13.926 --> 09:16.293
- Hamptons Heritage...
- It's a good hospital.

09:16.295 --> 09:18.395
It is. I just imagined that

09:18.397 --> 09:21.431
Boris would prefer a state-of-the-art suite

09:21.433 --> 09:23.834
with a world-class O.B.

09:23.836 --> 09:25.402
He did.

09:25.404 --> 09:27.170
And I ignored his preference.

09:27.172 --> 09:30.340
Just like he ignored embracing his baby.

09:30.342 --> 09:33.076
Looks like we're going to
be a simple, traditional family.

09:33.078 --> 09:34.711
Is there really such a thing?

09:34.713 --> 09:38.181
By the way, Boris doesn't
know the sex of the baby.

09:38.183 --> 09:40.684
I would appreciate your
discretion when you see him.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.552
How did you know that I was seeing Boris?

09:42.554 --> 09:45.055
Well, even though we are barely speaking,

09:45.057 --> 09:46.556
I am still aware of his schedule.

09:46.558 --> 09:49.760
In fact, I'm so glad that
you're checking up on him.

09:49.762 --> 09:53.797
I hear him pacing at all hours, and...

09:53.799 --> 09:57.067
the stress is hard on him,
and it worries me.

10:07.879 --> 10:10.514
Hey. You must be Nola?

10:10.516 --> 10:12.482
- Mm, I am.
- Good.

10:12.484 --> 10:14.384
Just so you know, we spoke
on the phone earlier.

10:14.386 --> 10:16.086
- Mm-hmm.
- I was being chatty,

10:16.088 --> 10:18.655
- and not flirty.
- Imagine my relief.

10:18.657 --> 10:21.224
Sorry about the mess. Tight schedule.

10:21.226 --> 10:26.129
So... as you know, your dad
scored a spot in home detention.

10:26.131 --> 10:28.031
Yeah, what does that mean exactly?

10:28.033 --> 10:31.635
Uh, it means he is subject
to electronic monitoring,

10:31.637 --> 10:34.805
and is required to remain
at home outside of working hours

10:34.807 --> 10:38.342
and certain pre-approved events,
medical appointments,

10:38.344 --> 10:40.243
religious activities... that sort of thing.

10:40.245 --> 10:42.446
Hey, what's the "R" for in Eddie R.?

10:42.448 --> 10:45.082
Oh, it doesn't stand
for anything, actually.

10:45.084 --> 10:47.617
So he works here? Our dad?

10:47.619 --> 10:50.654
Um, I don't know, what does he look like?

10:50.656 --> 10:52.889
Aren't you his lawyer?

10:52.891 --> 10:55.559
His, and 172 other inmates.

10:55.561 --> 10:57.060
Can't get to know them all personally.

10:57.062 --> 10:58.762
- Right.
- Ugh!

10:58.764 --> 11:00.831
These are good. You should order.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.466
- Oh.
- Excuse me!

11:02.468 --> 11:04.468
Hi, is there an Eddie Lawson working here?

22:51.202 --> 22:53.770
That could be a seizure focus
or it could be nothing.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.304
And I still wanna see his blood work.

22:55.306 --> 22:57.340
So how do you have access to this clinic?

22:57.342 --> 23:00.043
Oh, the man who sponsored me built it.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.844
As a matter of fact, he built
the entire development.

23:01.846 --> 23:03.179
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.348
The guy who sponsors your home detention?

23:05.350 --> 23:07.183
Wow. I mean, who is he?

23:07.185 --> 23:10.286
Oh, uh, Ted Roth.
Yeah, he's a local big shot.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.889
He vouched for me
with the Bureau of Prisons.

23:12.891 --> 23:16.225
And then if I check-in at
his place by curfew,

23:16.227 --> 23:17.860
everybody's happy.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.296
Well, does he live nearby,
'cause we'd love to meet him.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.065
- Mm.
- Oh, you will, you will.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.833
Probably at the hearing.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.268
You know, but Ted is golfing.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.604
And you never disturb Ted
when he's golfing.

23:28.606 --> 23:31.641
Oh, yeah, you never...
how did you meet this guy?

23:31.643 --> 23:33.609
Ted? I've known Ted forever.

23:33.611 --> 23:36.746
- Huh.
- Hey, it's reverend Phil.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.081
He wants to know if you're coming.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.049
- Of course I am.
- Thanks.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.784
He's also got a few questions for you.

23:41.786 --> 23:44.187
- Okay.
- Uh, reverend Phil?

23:44.189 --> 23:46.689
Yeah, Shaw's being baptized later today.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.859
He wants to make his faith legit.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.829
- You'll excuse me, boys.
- Sure, sure.

23:55.032 --> 23:56.499
You thinking what I'm thinking?

23:56.501 --> 23:57.767
Not usually.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.635
Dad and Shaw Morgan,
that was already weird.

23:59.637 --> 24:02.038
Now there's some mysterious
big-shot sponsor guy?

24:02.040 --> 24:04.574
Oh, and reverend Phil's on the phone.

24:04.576 --> 24:05.808
Something's up.

24:05.810 --> 24:09.112
Wow, I was thinking
what you were thinking.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.414
I'm gonna try to find this Ted Roth guy.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.715
See if he's legit.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.250
Maybe figure out what kind impression

24:14.252 --> 24:16.252
- he'll make at dad's hearing.
- Okay.

24:16.254 --> 24:17.887
But if he is credible, don't come off like

24:17.889 --> 24:19.455
the family's pressuring him. Be discreet.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.724
You're talking to
Evan R. Lawson right now, okay?

24:21.726 --> 24:23.126
Discretion's my middle name.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.495
So that's what the "R" stands for.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.731
[Knocking] Marissa.

24:28.733 --> 24:32.001
- Everything all right?
- I'm having contractions.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.337
But I don't wanna be one
of those first-time mothers

24:34.339 --> 24:35.838
that goes running to the hospital too soon.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.841
Come on in. Let's take a look.

24:44.982 --> 24:47.250
- Ah, thank you.
- There we go.

24:47.252 --> 24:51.487
I'm not even dilated, am I?

24:51.489 --> 24:53.356
Quite the opposite.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.825
You're having this baby now.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.393
Uh, should we call Boris?

24:57.395 --> 25:00.229
Uh, yes, but we probably shouldn't wait.

25:00.231 --> 25:01.564
Well, let me get the obstetrics.

25:01.566 --> 25:04.167
Yes, ke... go, go, yes, yes.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.334
Oh.

25:05.336 --> 25:08.905
[Speaking Romanian]

25:08.907 --> 25:12.041
Yeah?

25:12.043 --> 25:14.410
[Whispers] [Speaking German]

25:14.412 --> 25:16.279
[Whispers]

25:16.281 --> 25:22.251
[Speaking Romanian]
<i>...If we could interrupt for a moment...</i>

25:26.723 --> 25:28.491
<i>Nein!</i>

25:28.493 --> 25:32.094
[Speaking German]

25:34.415 --> 25:36.517
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.385
Marissa, you're doing great.

25:38.387 --> 25:39.787
Doing great, just keep blowing.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.723
Keep blowing, keep blowing. [Pants]

25:42.725 --> 25:43.824
Okay, you can push now.

25:43.826 --> 25:46.326
[Grunts]

25:46.328 --> 25:47.394
I'll call Dr. Jamison.

25:47.396 --> 25:50.164
[Groaning] It's too late.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.266
I'll have the car brought around then.

25:52.268 --> 25:54.802
No, we can't transport
her now, the baby's crowning.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.970
It's further than that.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.006
[Yelling in spanish]

25:59.008 --> 26:00.774
Nice work, Marissa, that was the head.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.142
Oh. [Groans]

26:02.144 --> 26:03.911
[Inhales, holds breath] Okay, wait, wait.

26:03.913 --> 26:05.813
Don't push now. Try not to push okay?

26:05.815 --> 26:07.347
- Nuchal cord?
- Mm-hmm.

26:07.349 --> 26:08.782
What? What does that mean?

26:08.784 --> 26:10.017
That the cord, it's around the neck.

26:10.019 --> 26:11.819
Okay, Marissa, just try to relax.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.520
- You're doing great.
- Well, cut it then.

26:13.522 --> 26:15.022
- No.
- Cut it for God's sake.

26:15.024 --> 26:17.257
- No, I need it intact.
- Don't listen to her.

26:17.259 --> 26:18.792
- Cut it!
- Sh!

26:18.794 --> 26:22.029
We have to be calm in this situation.

26:22.031 --> 26:25.699
It's only looped once. I think I can...

26:25.701 --> 26:27.634
[Sighs] Okay, I got it, I got it.

26:27.636 --> 26:31.338
[Panting]

26:31.340 --> 26:33.674
Okay.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.876
All right, Marissa,
you ready for the shoulders?

26:35.878 --> 26:37.778
[Groans]

26:37.780 --> 26:40.013
Go on then, push. I've got you.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.448
[Groans] Right, right, right.

26:41.450 --> 26:44.051
[Moans] Great! You did it!

26:44.053 --> 26:46.486
[Moans] Oh, you did it,

26:46.488 --> 26:48.522
you have a beautiful baby boy.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.159
[Baby whimpers, cries] A boy.

26:52.161 --> 26:55.362
[Whimpers] - Baby.
- A boy.

26:55.364 --> 26:58.398
[Cries] [Laughing]

26:58.400 --> 26:59.666
[Baby crying]

26:59.668 --> 27:02.669
- Yellow sweater.
- Thanks.

27:05.506 --> 27:08.809
You play by the rules
or you play with someone else.

27:08.811 --> 27:10.811
You don't repair divots off the green.

27:10.813 --> 27:12.512
He's right.

27:12.514 --> 27:15.048
- That is the rule.
- Thank you.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.851
Hard to blame them,
cheating's their only hope.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.086
[Laughing]

27:19.088 --> 27:22.389
Nonetheless, they must be stopped, right?

27:22.391 --> 27:25.759
- Hey, aren't you Ted Roth?
- Guilty.

27:25.761 --> 27:27.694
The guy who's sponsoring Eddie R. Lawson?

27:31.299 --> 27:35.702
Excuse me.

27:35.704 --> 27:37.871
Keep your voice down!

27:37.873 --> 27:39.439
Why?

27:39.441 --> 27:43.677
Okay, I don't know which one
of my neighbors is your client,

27:43.679 --> 27:46.146
but you tell them they don't have to worry

27:46.148 --> 27:48.715
that an ex-con is going
to lower their property value.

27:48.717 --> 27:51.652
Lawson is just visiting,
he's not moving in.

27:51.654 --> 27:52.986
But he is getting out of prison.

27:52.988 --> 27:54.788
Well, maybe, maybe not.

27:54.790 --> 27:57.524
He can still do himself
in, he usually does.

27:57.526 --> 27:59.893
But that's just my opinion.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.662
Right, but you're his sponsor.

28:01.664 --> 28:04.765
So is that the opinion
you give the parole board?

28:07.068 --> 28:08.769
Listen...

28:08.771 --> 28:13.040
you just tell your client

28:13.042 --> 28:17.577
that come Monday, Lawson is vacating.

28:17.579 --> 28:19.880
- Yeah, but I...
- Try to be a good citizen,

28:19.882 --> 28:21.715
help those down on their luck.

28:21.717 --> 28:26.286
I spent many years
building up my reputation.

28:26.288 --> 28:30.624
I'm not going to let
someone I hardly know ruin it.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.427
- You understand?
- Yeah.

28:33.429 --> 28:37.164
Good for you.

28:37.166 --> 28:40.033
- Nice to meet you.
- You know it.

28:40.035 --> 28:42.436
All right, what'd
you have on the last hole?

28:42.438 --> 28:45.205
[Whimpers]

28:45.207 --> 28:46.673
[Cries] [Giggles]

28:46.675 --> 28:48.575
How beautiful is that?

28:48.577 --> 28:51.578
And it'll keep him warm.

28:54.082 --> 28:56.383
Is the anti-coagulant mixing?

28:56.385 --> 28:58.585
Yes, doctor.

28:58.587 --> 29:01.388
[Whimpers, cries]

29:01.390 --> 29:04.124
- Divya.
- Hm?

29:04.126 --> 29:06.460
Does he look all right to you?

29:06.462 --> 29:09.863
- Is he breathing?
- What's wrong?

29:09.865 --> 29:12.065
He seems a little lethargic.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.978
I'm going to clear a little moisture.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.113
Is he in distress?

29:26.115 --> 29:28.215
No. No, he'll be fine.

29:31.052 --> 29:32.853
Jill, get me oxygen.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.755
- Where is it?
- Tall cabinet.

29:34.757 --> 29:36.123
- Okay.
- Help her.

29:37.925 --> 29:40.227
- Is he getting dusky?
- Not yet.

29:41.496 --> 29:43.063
No, no, no, that won't work.

29:43.065 --> 29:44.631
If he has tachypnea, he needs C-pap.

29:44.633 --> 29:48.735
I am going to use blow-by.
It should help.

29:48.737 --> 29:50.704
Will you hold this?

29:57.078 --> 29:59.379
Relax, son.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.382
Deep breaths.

30:05.019 --> 30:07.621
Is he going to be okay?

30:07.623 --> 30:09.689
I think it's just transient tachypnea.

30:09.691 --> 30:10.724
Wet lungs.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.727
We will alert the hospital.

30:18.366 --> 30:21.768
Are you ready?

30:21.770 --> 30:23.670
So why did he need you here?

30:23.672 --> 30:25.972
Well, I'm shooting the baptism, for one.

30:25.974 --> 30:27.674
Oh. [Water splashes]

30:27.676 --> 30:28.942
Eddie R. Fellini over here.

30:28.944 --> 30:31.211
Yeah.

30:31.213 --> 30:35.215
And he needed me because
he started doubting himself.

30:35.217 --> 30:39.453
- Got it!
- Which is not like Shaw at all.

30:39.455 --> 30:41.154
So you think he's changed.

30:41.156 --> 30:43.023
Yeah, it's like he's lost.

30:43.025 --> 30:44.758
In prison, he was so confident.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.827
You know that he helped me get through.

30:46.829 --> 30:48.128
He was my only friend.

30:48.130 --> 30:49.896
At first, I thought "I like him"

30:49.898 --> 30:51.665
"because he reminds me of you and Evan."

30:51.667 --> 30:54.101
And then I thought, "no, I like him"

30:54.103 --> 30:56.470
"because he reminds me
of myself at his age."

30:56.472 --> 30:58.772
Confident, cocky, ambitious...

30:58.774 --> 31:00.774
Missing the point.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.309
- Dad.
- Yeah?

31:02.311 --> 31:04.211
Why didn't you mention your parole hearing?

31:04.213 --> 31:06.446
Because I wanted to
get the parole on my own.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.515
- You know, earn your respect.
- How's that working out?

31:08.517 --> 31:11.585
Well, if you had stayed home
like I had asked.

31:11.587 --> 31:13.253
- Oh, so this is our fault?
- Well, no, no, no.

31:13.255 --> 31:14.821
I didn't mean it exactly like that.

31:14.823 --> 31:17.257
Look, I've got something
very big to share with you boys

31:17.259 --> 31:19.025
when the time is right.

31:19.027 --> 31:22.496
So let me just get Shaw
to his kid, me to my hearing,

31:22.498 --> 31:25.098
- and then we'll talk.
- Wait, Shaw is a father?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.366
Oh, yeah.

31:26.368 --> 31:28.068
He's got an adorable daughter named Gina,

31:28.070 --> 31:29.636
but he doesn't know her very well.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.738
Because her mother thinks
he's a bad influence.

31:31.740 --> 31:34.107
But I think ever since he's got his faith,

31:34.109 --> 31:35.775
he can turn that around.

31:35.777 --> 31:37.144
That's why he's going to Austin,

31:37.146 --> 31:38.778
to be with his kid.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.680
So you're helping Shaw be a dad.

31:40.682 --> 31:43.049
Well, you and Evan
helped me get a second chance.

31:43.051 --> 31:44.918
So I thought I would help him get his.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.955
Hey!

31:48.957 --> 31:50.690
Congratulations.

31:50.692 --> 31:52.893
How do you feel?

31:52.895 --> 31:55.562
I don't know.

31:55.564 --> 31:58.532
Maybe I wasn't under long enough.

32:02.236 --> 32:06.173
You know...

32:06.175 --> 32:08.742
- maybe I could swim there.
- Swim where?

32:08.744 --> 32:11.978
Shaw, Shaw. Can I see your tattoo?

32:11.980 --> 32:13.313
You like it?

32:13.315 --> 32:15.815
Hard-core geeks need street cred.

32:15.817 --> 32:17.951
Looks like a rash underneath.

32:17.953 --> 32:20.687
Could be a sign of infection or hep C.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.923
I'll push the clinic for your test results.

32:22.925 --> 32:26.226
- Yeah, you do that.
- Shaw.

32:26.228 --> 32:29.029
Talk to me. Do you have abdominal pain?

32:29.031 --> 32:31.331
Listen to me, I wanna do another exam,

32:31.333 --> 32:32.666
and I think you need to rest.

32:32.668 --> 32:34.301
Oh, please listen to Hank.

32:34.303 --> 32:36.403
Look, he shouldn't be left alone.

32:36.405 --> 32:38.939
Yeah, but if I miss my curfew

32:38.941 --> 32:41.308
my ankle bracelet's
gonna give me an earful.

32:41.310 --> 32:42.809
Don't worry, until we get some answers

32:42.811 --> 32:44.511
I'm not going anywhere.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.569
Shaw's asleep?

32:52.571 --> 32:53.870
Seriously?

32:53.872 --> 32:55.472
No, I'm lying. Yeah, he's asle...

32:55.474 --> 32:56.739
you know, you don't have to do that.

32:56.741 --> 32:59.609
Oh, sorry.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.377
But thank you for asking.

33:01.379 --> 33:04.013
I love that you're so supportive of me,

33:04.015 --> 33:06.149
unlike some people I know.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.885
I can't say, he's right here.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.520
I love you too.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.523
Bye.

33:15.659 --> 33:18.194
- So that was Paige.
- Mm-hmm.

33:18.196 --> 33:22.131
Offering to fly down because
she can tell how upset I am.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.100
- She could tell, Hank.
- You told her dad's parole

33:24.102 --> 33:26.102
was in jeopardy and
she just sussed that out?

33:26.104 --> 33:28.171
Ooh, you're being sarcastic.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.873
You're defending someone
who doesn't need it.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.442
- Paige is great.
- But?

33:32.444 --> 33:34.077
Come on, there's always a but.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.945
But as much as I care about her...

33:35.947 --> 33:38.014
I care more about you.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.149
Then why can't you just be happy for me?

33:40.151 --> 33:42.852
I don't get it, why can't you just say

33:42.854 --> 33:46.556
"Congratulations, Evan,
here's to you and Paige"?

33:46.558 --> 33:49.025
Here's to you and Paige.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.260
What the hell was that?

33:50.262 --> 33:51.761
- I...
- That doesn't count!

33:51.763 --> 33:53.897
You don't mean that.
You don't even have a beer!

33:53.899 --> 33:55.665
I mean it. I mean it.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.901
But a couple of weeks ago, you
were convinced Paige dumped you

33:57.903 --> 34:00.069
because she hadn't returned
a couple of texts.

34:00.071 --> 34:02.238
That's just not a sign

34:02.240 --> 34:03.940
that you're secure in this relationship.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.775
I'm very secure in this relationship.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.344
Paige is very secure
in this relationship.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.679
You're the only one who isn't
secure in this relationship.

34:10.681 --> 34:14.751
You're not even in the relationship!

34:14.753 --> 34:16.819
[Sighs]

34:16.821 --> 34:19.922
What the... you're naked!

34:19.925 --> 34:21.157
You're naked!

34:21.159 --> 34:23.693
It's a hot tub. And you're a doctor,

34:23.695 --> 34:25.495
shouldn't the human body
be routine by now?

34:25.496 --> 34:27.563
Not yours. [Scoffs]

34:29.065 --> 34:31.400
- Your hunting accident.
- What about it?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.304
Were you just checking out my ass?

34:34.306 --> 34:37.040
Shaw doesn't have a rash on his back.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.975
They're scars.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.376
He was shot.

34:40.378 --> 34:42.145
You totally were just checking my ass out.

34:43.847 --> 34:45.148
Now it's awkward!

34:48.518 --> 34:51.187
So you were shot... as a kid?

34:51.188 --> 34:54.556
Goofing around with my cousin.

34:54.559 --> 34:55.792
It really hurt.

34:55.793 --> 34:59.362
My ass doesn't look that bad, right?

34:59.364 --> 35:02.332
Can you turn around for me, please?

35:06.704 --> 35:09.272
Okay, now, um... [Sighs]

35:09.274 --> 35:14.277
flex your foot for me.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.681
Can you pull your toes up?

35:18.683 --> 35:22.118
Okay, you didn't just
stumble off the porch.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.554
You literally tripped over your own feet

35:24.556 --> 35:26.589
because you lost neuromuscular control.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.291
It's called drop foot.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.827
Now when you said you got so
mad you couldn't see straight,

35:30.829 --> 35:33.029
were you experiencing tunnel vision?

35:33.031 --> 35:35.598
Yes.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.633
Maybe.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.668
[Door opens]

35:38.670 --> 35:39.736
How is he?

35:39.738 --> 35:42.772
- Hey.
- How are you?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.807
Hank pulled me from the water.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.943
I pulled you out of bed.

35:46.945 --> 35:50.780
Water.

35:50.782 --> 35:51.981
Bed.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.750
Why is he being this way?

35:53.752 --> 35:56.653
Well, disorientation is
a symptom of lead poisoning.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.187
He's got lead poisoning?

35:58.189 --> 35:59.622
He was shot when he was younger.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.457
Maybe not all of the pellets were removed.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.760
- Film'll be up in a sec.
- Thank you.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.062
[Clears throat] If I'm right...

36:06.064 --> 36:08.398
his X-ray will show us where the lead is.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.633
Yeah, but why now?
He was shot so long ago.

36:10.635 --> 36:13.136
Yeah, Shaw. When you
were beat up in prison,

36:13.138 --> 36:15.304
did they hit or kick your back?

36:15.306 --> 36:17.140
Yeah, so?

36:17.142 --> 36:19.676
No, so it's possible a pellet

36:19.678 --> 36:22.845
that had been encapsulated
in fibrous tissue was broken,

36:22.847 --> 36:25.281
and is now leeching lead
into your bloodstream.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.785
[Beeps]

36:28.787 --> 36:30.586
Or dozens of pellets.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.523
Holy crap.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.391
Dude, you're a walking arsenal.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.693
We need to get you to a hospital.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.394
No, no. No, stay away from me!

36:38.396 --> 36:39.896
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, easy.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.631
It's not the poison!

36:41.633 --> 36:44.167
I saw a light!

36:44.169 --> 36:46.002
I had a vision and it was real!

36:46.004 --> 36:47.403
- Of course it was...
- Get back!

36:47.405 --> 36:50.006
Stop, listen, volatility
is part of the poisoning.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.542
Just give him some space, okay?

36:52.544 --> 36:55.445
Shaw, I'm not saying it wasn't a vision.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.614
Lead toxicity doesn't
typically cause auras.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.551
You see, it doesn't change the meaning of

37:01.553 --> 37:04.687
what happened to you. Please.

37:04.689 --> 37:08.491
But...

37:08.493 --> 37:12.962
It could explain your other symptoms.

37:12.964 --> 37:16.899
Now let me help you.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.102
I just wanna see my little girl.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.636
I know.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.105
Let's call an ambulance

37:22.107 --> 37:26.476
and get you back on track to do that.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.411
Okay.

37:30.547 --> 37:33.015
The baby's had no
repeated episodes of T.T.N.,

37:33.017 --> 37:34.851
- but keep oxygen standing by.
- Okay.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.987
And alert the neo-natal I.C.U.
to have an apnea monitor ready.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.789
Hank made arrangements
for the cord blood.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.257
I'll deliver it
first thing in the morning.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.925
My driver will take you now.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.462
Or now. Now's good.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.231
That blood can prove invaluable.

37:48.233 --> 37:51.234
Should our son... someday need it.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.440
[Whimpers] Hi.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.779
Okay.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.748
Well, we'll see you at Hamptons Heritage.

38:10.187 --> 38:11.788
- Easy...
- Got it?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.323
- Got it.
- Sir.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.392
I realize that my reaction earlier

38:16.394 --> 38:18.895
to your elevated blood
pressure was overzealous,

38:18.897 --> 38:20.363
- but...
- Miss Katdare...

38:20.365 --> 38:23.366
today is not a day you need
to defend your professionalism.

38:25.502 --> 38:27.403
Thank you.

38:27.405 --> 38:29.005
You say "thank you?"

38:29.007 --> 38:32.942
No.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.945
Let's go.

38:50.327 --> 38:52.595
I got it. He's in.

38:52.597 --> 38:55.631
Okay.

39:02.172 --> 39:03.573
He's mentally altered,

39:03.575 --> 39:05.241
but the chelation will reverse that.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.475
Yeah, but Hank, you saved his life.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.010
Yeah, that's great, maybe now we can

39:08.012 --> 39:09.512
- focus on yours, dad.
- Yeah.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.515
Uh-oh.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.219
You're supposed to be in the house.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.654
- That's his sponsor.
- Oh.

39:18.656 --> 39:20.857
Hank? Evan?

39:20.859 --> 39:23.192
I'm sorry, you know us?

39:23.194 --> 39:25.061
No. Thanks to him, I don't.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.697
Oh, that's rich, dad.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.533
I'm sorry, what did you just call him?

39:30.535 --> 39:33.536
Boys, meet Ted Roth, your grandfather.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.238
What?

39:35.240 --> 39:36.739
You said your father was dead.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.074
Well, dead to me.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.709
I told you I had something
big to share with you.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.344
- Yeah.
- Wait a sec, wait.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.045
So you're not my dad's sponsor?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.680
I'm that too.

39:44.682 --> 39:46.582
Why did you say you were an attorney?

39:46.584 --> 39:48.751
I didn't. You said that.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.888
Oh. The apple doesn't fall too far.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.023
You know what, Evan is a very good boy.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.325
See, this is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.761
One false move, he writes you off.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.731
I'm not the one who
held a grudge for 40 years!

40:01.733 --> 40:03.332
No, you're the one who threw me out.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.401
I'm the one who extended
the olive branch.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.769
Olive branch!

40:06.771 --> 40:09.205
More like a "get out of jail free" branch!

40:09.207 --> 40:11.240
Guys, guys, as heartwarming as this is...

40:11.242 --> 40:12.675
Wait, how did you get Lawson from Roth?

40:12.677 --> 40:14.076
That's what the "R" stands for.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.778
Bingo.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.581
Hey! Hey, have you seen the patient?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.383
Shaw? You guys just took him away.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.485
He jumped out of the ambulance
when we stopped at the gate.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.719
Who's Shaw?

40:23.721 --> 40:24.954
Well, he's not in his right mind.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.522
- Could he have gone home?
- Who's Shaw?

40:26.524 --> 40:28.758
- He wanted to swim to Austin.
- That sounds well-thought out.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.126
Okay, look, the beach, let's go.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.929
Move over, dad. I'll drive.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.264
- Everybody in?
- Let's go, go, go...

40:35.266 --> 40:37.099
Who is Shaw?

40:43.099 --> 40:45.534
Okay, Evan... You head east.

40:45.536 --> 40:46.935
- Yep.
- I'll try west.

40:46.937 --> 40:49.304
Dad, comb this area, make sure...
[Ankle bracelet beeps]

40:49.306 --> 40:50.906
- Uh, damn.
- Your charm bracelet.

40:50.908 --> 40:52.507
All right, dad, go be where you need to be.

40:52.509 --> 40:54.876
You're past curfew. You're
gonna screw your parole.

40:54.878 --> 40:56.111
Well, then screw it.

40:56.113 --> 40:57.612
There's a man missing with lead poisoning.

40:57.614 --> 40:59.047
He's disoriented.

40:59.049 --> 41:00.515
He could be heading
towards a seizure or coma.

41:00.517 --> 41:02.484
- Welcome to Florida.
- Guys!

41:02.486 --> 41:05.487
Over here. [Bracelet continues beeps]

41:08.891 --> 41:11.493
- Are these his?
- Well, I don't know, maybe.

41:11.495 --> 41:13.662
Shaw! Shaw!

41:13.664 --> 41:15.263
- Dad, dad...
Both: - You can't swim!

41:15.265 --> 41:16.565
- Come on.
- Shaw!

41:16.567 --> 41:19.568
- Shaw!
- Shaw!

41:29.545 --> 41:31.113
Hi, I need to get the number

41:31.115 --> 41:33.482
to the Long Island
blood bank in West Islip.

41:33.484 --> 41:35.350
I already phoned them, Ms. Casey.

41:35.352 --> 41:37.119
They are staying open for us.

41:37.121 --> 41:38.820
Thanks.

41:38.822 --> 41:41.823
No, not you. Never mind.

41:44.293 --> 41:47.028
Would you care for a drink?

41:47.030 --> 41:49.998
Well, I don't know. What you got?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.134
Only the best.

41:52.136 --> 41:56.671
Oh, yes, you do.

41:56.673 --> 41:58.340
Yeah, maybe after...
