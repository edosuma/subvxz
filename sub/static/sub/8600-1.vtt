01:46.106 --> 01:48.190
Please God, help me.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.359
Please God, help me.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.808
Oh, you're already back,
John?

02:22.976 --> 02:25.769
Oh-oh. What did our
boys break this time?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.355
John!

02:47.709 --> 02:50.043
Let's go in my office.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.848
John, the reason I called you here...
take a seat will you?

03:09.772 --> 03:13.150
Reverend Beaumont dropped by
a little while ago.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.404
He said your daughter is living
in his church. Since when?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.949
Since Tuesday.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.413
This is very awkward.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.791
He gave me this.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.878
She signed it.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.309
- Is there a problem, Boss?
- Shh.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.916
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October

04:11.459 --> 04:14.920
the 14th, 1990.
State your full name.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.505
- John Gray.
- And your occupation.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.091
Auto mechanic.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.719
Okay, well you already know me,
I already know you so...

04:22.887 --> 04:26.848
...why don't we not play any games and you
can start by telling me why you're here.

04:27.016 --> 04:30.852
Well I'm... I'm really confused
and I've been thinking about...

04:31.020 --> 04:34.856
I've been thinking about this
all night. And I've been praying.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.484
- Does that help? Praying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.363
But I don't know, you see.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.241
Part of me says it's impossible.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.620
I... I don't remember anything.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.081
It's just impossible.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.419
All right, well then
what is the other part say?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.548
Some things are obvious.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.470
Such as?

05:05.847 --> 05:09.391
First of all I'm completely sure
about one thing.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.686
Angela never lies.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.815
She'd never do that.
Her mother was just like her, a saint.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.110
And I don't know. Little details
like not hugging or kissing me.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.946
So she's...
she's been avoiding you?

05:23.114 --> 05:24.656
Yeah.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.701
And then... also the...

05:27.869 --> 05:29.411
John.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.331
Cut the shit,
take your hat off first of all.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.291
- What?
- Take your hat off.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.046
Why do you think she
was avoiding you, John?

05:45.261 --> 05:46.803
Cause I did it.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.308
I did it.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.068
He admits it, but he doesn't remember
doing it? I don't get it.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.905
He's just stalling for time. I need to talk
to the girl as soon as possible.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.282
Reverend says she
doesn't want to see anybody.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.535
Well I don't care about the Reverend,
right. We need a psychologist.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.954
- A psychologist?
- We need a good one.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.041
Lean on him until he breaks. Do your thing.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.876
It's child abuse, Chief.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.221
Mrs. Gray.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.725
I'll make you some tea, okay?

07:18.479 --> 07:19.896
Mrs. Gray.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.732
Did you know?

07:25.695 --> 07:28.155
The Reverend called me and told me.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.949
But I...

07:32.910 --> 07:34.995
I talked to my son, and...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.748
he flew into a rage. He denied everything.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.878
Reverend, please...
I need to see her.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.797
We've already discussed that, Rose.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.675
She'd rather stay at the church.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.846
Mrs. Gray. You think it would all right if
I went, took a look at Angela's room?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.599
- It's upstairs.
- Thank you.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.980
It's the last door.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.983
- What?
- It's the last door.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.994
Hey Bruce.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.746
This isn't right, we
need a warrant.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.666
She gave us permission. Are you asleep?
Where's the son?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.836
Roy? He left two years ago.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.257
Where'd he go?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.303
You don't know?

09:57.930 --> 10:02.309
You're friends with the family and
you don't know where he went?

10:03.978 --> 10:07.147
They've suffered a lot,
I wouldn't bring that up.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.940
Mrs. Gray.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.819
Have you heard from your grandson?

10:13.613 --> 10:18.783
Not really. He calls sometimes
to say he's okay.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.869
But...

10:21.037 --> 10:24.998
Why did he leave? You think
he was running from his father?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.752
I asked my son last night.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.462
And what did he say?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.380
He took my hand...

10:33.591 --> 10:35.133
And...

10:36.344 --> 10:37.886
we prayed.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.355
It's not an urban legend.
The Satanists are living among us.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.358
Like any religious group,
they worship their lord,

10:51.525 --> 10:55.945
the Devil, and perform horrible rituals.
The question we should ask ourselves...

10:56.113 --> 10:58.823
How can you listen to this right now.
Can I turn it off?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.201
No, turn it off.
It's your car.

11:04.413 --> 11:09.167
John... I knew he had problems
but molesting his daughter?

11:10.378 --> 11:12.379
- I can't believe it.
- Why not?

11:12.546 --> 11:15.173
Because you both go to the same church?

11:16.759 --> 11:20.970
What if? I mean what if...
...it was a caress.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.764
A show of affection?

11:24.558 --> 11:27.519
His daughter exaggerated it.
She's kind of difficult.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.854
Really?
That's not what I hear.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.982
- Said she's a little shy.
- I saw her grow up, Bruce.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.445
You've seen that house,
you've seen the way that they live.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.614
On top of that,
she lost her mom.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.034
She's had a pretty shitty life.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.203
Maybe she just...

11:46.372 --> 11:49.290
wanted to get away from it all.
I don't know.

11:49.458 --> 11:53.545
Well still, I mean you really think
a seventeen year old girl is going to...

11:53.713 --> 11:58.258
...put her dad in prison just because
she wants to change her life?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.552
We can't rule that out.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.513
Right?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.349
Yeah right, can't rule it out.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.775
The boy calls his grandmother from a bar.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.236
Trace one of those calls damn it.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.197
Don't call me again until you find him.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.533
Well?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.120
Well umm..

12:28.372 --> 12:32.167
- His mental state appears to be normal.
- I already told you that.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.794
Big question is, why the sudden amnesia?

12:34.962 --> 12:38.089
No one's going to believe him.
Bruce. Mr. Raines is here.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.341
Don't think he's after anything.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.509
What?

12:41.677 --> 12:43.803
If he doesn't want a lawyer, then he isn't

12:43.971 --> 12:46.598
- trying to protect himself, right?
- I don't understand.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.725
- Bruce!
- Yeah, I'm right here.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.437
Say that again, professor, will ya.
I'm a bit of a dummy sometimes.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.356
I don't think what John is doing
is a strategy,

12:55.524 --> 12:58.651
on the contrary I think
he's trying to cooperate.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.530
He keeps saying: I think I did it.
But speaks like he wasn't there.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.949
And to a certain
extent, he wasn't.

13:06.035 --> 13:10.246
See this is a man who has spent years
trying to stop drinking.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.875
And he does it by giving in to faith
which is an explosive combination.

13:14.043 --> 13:18.379
Because on the one hand,
he goes too far, does awful things.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.927
On the other hand he can't live
with the awful things he's done. So now...

13:24.094 --> 13:26.513
...he can't find them in his head.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.435
- He can't find them?
- He's repressed them.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.562
The memories are behind some doors.

13:34.730 --> 13:39.317
It's not that difficult to find a key
and free them. Provoke a regression.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.238
Look, I'm not an expert.
But, I don't know.

13:43.405 --> 13:47.033
- This all seems a little...
- It seems a little strange, doesn't it?

13:47.201 --> 13:52.705
I suppose umm... I often tell my students
that the mind is a whole universe.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.792
I read an article about this.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.004
Regressive hypnosis has made
great progress, gentlemen.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.799
Anyway, I hope you didn't...

14:03.425 --> 14:07.345
...interrupt my classes,
to discuss these topics with me.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.099
Or did you?

14:15.604 --> 14:18.273
I've been very confused ever since.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.985
My father ordered me
not to tell anyone.

14:22.403 --> 14:26.239
He said, be a good girl and the Lord
will watch over you.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.117
But I know this is wrong.

14:29.618 --> 14:33.746
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him.

14:34.748 --> 14:38.084
I'm scared,
I don't know if I should.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.421
Okay. John, again.
Concentrate

14:41.589 --> 14:46.134
on the first sentence. Last year
my father started coming into my room.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.388
Last year...

14:51.473 --> 14:55.727
Remember what I said, John,
let the pendulum clear your mind.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.645
Look through it.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.610
This is no use.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.904
How long are we going to keep doing this?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.740
Just one more time.
Let yourself go.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.745
I want you to relax every muscle
in your body.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.663
Third sentence.

15:17.374 --> 15:22.003
My father ordered me not to tell anyone.
He said, be a good girl

15:22.171 --> 15:24.172
and the Lord will
watch over you.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.634
...and the Lord will watch over you.
Yes, I said that.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.761
I said that to her plenty of times.
But...

15:29.929 --> 15:32.597
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.601
Your daughter wrote this. Right?
You realize that?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.605
It's her handwriting, John.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.983
You yourself said, your
daughter never lies.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.778
No, she would never lie.
She would never lie to me.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.405
Well she must be, and
if you don't remember it...

15:49.573 --> 15:52.408
Oh God! God please...

15:52.993 --> 15:55.536
- Oh God help me I...
- John.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.790
John.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.836
Behind the pendulum...

16:05.673 --> 16:07.590
Right behind...

16:17.142 --> 16:19.936
Oh wait, wait-wait-wait.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.313
I think I see something.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.274
Okay, John. Tell us what you see.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.696
I see... is it my house?
And I'm moving.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.908
Jesus. Jesus it's just like I was there.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.871
Just read it again, please.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.793
Last year, my father
started coming into my room.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.880
I've been very confused ever since.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.343
He touches me and
forces me to have sex with him.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.221
I see her.
She's sitting there on the bed.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.893
I'm on top of her, Jesus!

17:01.729 --> 17:04.105
- God no!
- What are you doing to her?

17:05.523 --> 17:07.608
I tied her hands to the
headboard.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.527
You're tying her?
Can you see the rope?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.363
Yeah... Yeah it's a rope.
It's a black rope.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.407
Why is it black? Is it some type of ritual?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.454
Hold on. Hold on. Now he's...
I'm tying her feet!

17:19.954 --> 17:23.124
Wait, wait. You said "he".
Where are you watching this from?

17:23.291 --> 17:26.627
I'm right there,
I'm standing right there by the bed.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.759
- Are you seeing yourself?
- I guess. It has to be me, right?

17:32.926 --> 17:35.386
No, that's somebody else.
Focus on the face.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.139
Why! Then why aren't I stopping it?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.308
What the hell am I doing there!

17:40.476 --> 17:42.935
Somebody you let in,
somebody you must know.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.271
Why aren't I stopping
it! Jesus!

17:45.439 --> 17:48.191
- Angela!
- A face, John. It's someone you know.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.486
I don't know who it is!
It could be anybody!

17:51.653 --> 17:53.988
Who has been in your
house in the last year?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.324
- You know who it is, John...
- Detective...

18:00.496 --> 18:03.748
I guess... I'm holding a camera...

18:05.667 --> 18:07.752
I'm taking pictures!

18:08.170 --> 18:11.380
Hold on just a second...
I see... I think I see.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.219
It's George!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.012
George Nesbitt?

18:18.180 --> 18:20.473
- Okay...
- George Nesbitt?

18:26.188 --> 18:27.647
Hey George!

18:30.150 --> 18:31.734
Hey George.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.447
Hey Bruce. How'd it go with John?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.074
Where you doing?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.159
Where do you think?
My shift is over.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.083
Is there a problem?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.878
Your name came up.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.681
My name?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.351
What'd he say?

19:05.727 --> 19:10.690
You tell me, huh George.
You tell me.

19:13.318 --> 19:17.280
What if I told you I just looked at all the
photos. Would you tell me you did it then?

19:17.447 --> 19:20.533
- We have the photos.
- If you showed me.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.621
Oh I get it...

19:30.627 --> 19:33.838
Wait a minute, no. I'm not sure...
This is all really weird.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.009
Five minutes ago I would have
never believed it. Now I wanna kill you.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.887
- Give me your gun.
- Bruce, take it easy okay.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.139
I am taking it easy.
Give me your gun.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.849
What photos...

19:45.267 --> 19:47.560
Now you don't know what
I'm talking about huh?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.228
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

19:56.069 --> 19:59.989
Oh please. Give me a break,
you assaulted him without saying a word.

20:00.157 --> 20:04.160
I would never do that Katie,
and you know that. You know he's lying.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.121
That's enough.
Nesbitt is my client now.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.624
And that whole thing
about the photos,

20:09.791 --> 20:14.503
if you had them, you'd already
have shown them to me, don't you think?

20:15.339 --> 20:17.715
So who's the one lying here, Bruce?

20:19.676 --> 20:22.595
Without saying a word...
Do you hear this bull shit, Chief?

20:22.763 --> 20:26.140
We need to talk to the girl.
If she identifies him.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.351
Just hold your horses.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.437
Sometimes I wish I was like you, Bruce.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.147
For me this is all...

20:34.775 --> 20:36.734
Nesbitt was one of our own.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.364
Just remember that, okay.
Take your psychologist.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.074
Thanks Chief.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.245
We're leaving.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.937
You suspected Nesbitt
before John said his name, why?

21:13.105 --> 21:17.316
There was something off about him.
I am a Detective, Professor.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.944
I see. Nevertheless,

21:21.697 --> 21:24.615
But please do not interfere
with my therapy again.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.244
You and your people can ask him
anything you like. But after that...

21:28.412 --> 21:29.996
...it's my turn.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.152
Oh hey. Hello Angela.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.073
My name's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Please, have a seat.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.582
We actually met before once
in your father's workshop.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.002
You wouldn't remember,
you were... smaller.

22:19.421 --> 22:25.217
We just want to have a little chat. This is
Professor Raines. He's our psychologist.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.597
Angela, do you want me to stay?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.565
We're just going to ask
you a few questions.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.275
I'm not crazy.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.903
No, of course not.

22:47.199 --> 22:51.035
The reason I'm asking
so many questions is because...

22:53.205 --> 22:55.831
We know there was
someone else in the room.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.334
Your father told us.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.044
But why?

23:02.631 --> 23:04.090
Why did he say that?

23:04.257 --> 23:07.134
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.928
I don't want to go on
with this.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.389
Angela. These people hurt you.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.141
And they could hurt
someone else.

23:14.309 --> 23:18.270
Your father said something about a ritual?
What's all that about?

23:25.695 --> 23:29.073
Would you like to write it down?
Sometimes that helps.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.543
Alone.
I want to do it alone.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.795
Okay.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.469
She was always sad.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.889
Like she was shutting herself in.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.060
It was in one of our seminars.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.480
...stay away from me
Satan, I have Jesus.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.608
She just started crying all of a sudden.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.861
Then I realized...

24:07.279 --> 24:10.823
It was like, like God
had spoken to me.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.868
I'd prefer to call that intuition,
Reverend.

24:14.035 --> 24:17.955
Call it whatever you want.
But I knew it was her father.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.835
And that it had happened
more than once.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.413
Angela?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.542
These things they did to you?

25:03.710 --> 25:06.253
When they summoned the Devil.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.258
Who else was there with your father?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.094
Could you please tell me?
His name?

25:40.497 --> 25:42.039
You did great.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.221
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about Satanism.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.932
Are you a man of faith?

26:00.850 --> 26:03.269
I'm afraid I'm in no mood
to answer that question.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.689
Agnostic. You want to believe,
but you can't.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.192
Don't worry.
I went through that phase myself.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.167
I got a hold of a copy.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.093
You branded her with an inverted cross.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.898
Now I'm starting to understand
why you came to us.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.526
It wasn't to get over
your wife's death.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.574
It was to desecrate our church.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.410
Well Reverend,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.163
I...

27:05.290 --> 27:07.916
You don't know what I'm talking about.

27:08.501 --> 27:12.546
You don't remember
the insults, or the torture?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.715
Or the excrement or...

27:18.053 --> 27:22.389
Okay John...
Just do us all a favour.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.392
Try.

27:40.825 --> 27:44.119
...as part of a ritual
involving black magic.

27:44.287 --> 27:49.041
One of his accomplices could even belong
to the Hoyer Police Department.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.585
And tonight,
don't miss our special segment...

27:51.753 --> 27:54.421
Wonderful. That's what
I call not causing a panic.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.633
...keep the people of
this city in suspense.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.828
- Hello?
- It's Cleveland, turn on the TV.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.122
Yeah, all right.
What channel?

28:31.334 --> 28:33.293
Yeah. Give me a second.

28:40.844 --> 28:44.888
We used to consider Satanic ritual abuse
something from the middle ages,

28:45.056 --> 28:46.640
or literary fantasy.

28:47.308 --> 28:52.354
But in the last few years,
books like this one have opened our eyes.

28:53.314 --> 28:57.860
They branded his sign
on my back, said that I was his slave.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.322
They made me attend
their ceremonies for 15 years.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.742
One time I even saw
them sacrifice...

29:04.909 --> 29:06.493
Yeah right I'll see you tomorrow.

29:06.661 --> 29:11.123
Maybe it's easier to think people
aren't capable of doing things like this.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.792
It's very sad.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.361
No! No! I don't want to!

29:57.754 --> 30:03.467
Okay, Angela says that
Nesbitt branded this...

30:04.052 --> 30:06.470
...on her stomach with a knife.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.349
John just corroborated it.
That's not all.

30:11.309 --> 30:15.103
Now he remembers something about
a black cat and someone wearing a hood.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.524
You can imagine what
I'm talking about.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.778
Satanic Ritual Abuse.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.781
How long will you detain
George without any proof?

30:25.949 --> 30:29.201
He's a cop, we can detain him
as long as necessary.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.747
Tom. Find this book.
Get everybody a copy.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.376
- Everybody?
- S. Cooper, she was on TV last night.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.087
- Can I make photocopies?
- Just a copy Tom.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.048
We're poor... I had to say it.

30:43.842 --> 30:48.262
Boss, I actually read that book.
But it seemed like a pile of trash to me.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.765
Baby sacrifices and snuff movies? Come on.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.892
The FBI would be
all over something like that.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.769
Really? What do you
know about it?

30:55.937 --> 30:57.896
Have you even
bothered to call the FBI?

30:59.607 --> 31:00.607
No, but...

31:00.775 --> 31:03.861
This case is a little bit more complicated

31:04.028 --> 31:06.697
than taking a stroll
and handing out parking tickets.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.450
We have to be on-point.
No mistakes.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.619
Even if it's just this one time.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.830
What's that mean,
just this one time.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.416
Okay, okay. Enough! Enough!

31:18.001 --> 31:20.252
Go on, get the job done.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.054
I thought this was a quiet town.

31:31.472 --> 31:34.266
Keep thinking of my granddaughters, Jesus.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.855
You don't look too good.
You sleepin'?

31:40.940 --> 31:43.650
I just get the feeling
with this case...

31:44.319 --> 31:46.653
- What?
- I don't know.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.865
That look in your eyes scares me.

31:50.033 --> 31:55.537
It's a part of something bigger.
You know much bigger.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.293
Charlie, how many times
did I say, knock first.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.879
- Sorry Chief. Ahh, we found him.
- Who?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.132
John's son. Roy.
He lives in Pittsburgh.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.760
Okay. Where the hell is Tom?

32:09.928 --> 32:14.723
Ask him, if our department
can afford two plane tickets to Pittsburgh.

32:28.905 --> 32:33.992
- Your father told us.
- Why? Why did he say that?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.995
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.832
- I don't want to go on with this.
- Angela, these people hurt you.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.878
Do you make your wife listen to this
over and over again?

32:46.381 --> 32:52.135
- We're separated.
- Well now you know why.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.954
Hey Roy.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.876
- A ritual?
- Yeah.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.047
- It's a great story.
- Does it surprise you?

33:29.215 --> 33:31.425
My father worships the devil?

33:32.176 --> 33:35.387
What would you think?
Good girl.

33:36.055 --> 33:39.850
Is that why you ran away?
To get away from him?

33:40.018 --> 33:43.603
- Why don't you ask him.
- I did. That's why I'm here.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.732
What about your mother?
Was she good to you?

33:47.358 --> 33:51.028
Yeah. When she left us.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.240
She killed herself... Did you know that?

33:55.408 --> 33:59.494
I just know what it said in the report -
a car accident. A lapse at the wheel.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.414
My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.

34:03.374 --> 34:07.169
He's a drunk, you know,
it's probably not in the report.

34:07.336 --> 34:12.174
He got us all involved in that Evangelical
stuff, like that would make things better.

34:12.341 --> 34:16.636
Why don't you tell us about that.
What was he like when he drank?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.639
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.895
Why don't you tell me
what he did to you and Angela.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.440
Just forget it, okay.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.734
I understand how these things
might be difficult...

34:30.902 --> 34:33.360
They're things that didn't happen!

34:34.322 --> 34:38.742
If they didn't happen, then why
do you need to raise your voice to say it.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.661
You've been through something
very traumatic.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.870
It's quite normal for the
mechanisms in the brain...

34:44.956 --> 34:46.666
Are you deaf! Huh?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.835
All right, take it easy okay.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.880
Sit down. We're just talking.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.386
Roy, I'm a police officer.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.014
I'm going to tell you
what I'm looking at.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.768
I'm looking at a young man.
Who doesn't speak to his sister.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.063
Doesn't speak to his father.
And is living in an abandoned building.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.107
What's wrong with you?

35:10.274 --> 35:13.819
You need to stop fighting everybody
and find the real enemy,

35:13.986 --> 35:16.863
the person who made you feel
exactly like him.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.407
A loser.

35:23.913 --> 35:27.249
I have a very simple
proposition for you, Roy.

35:27.416 --> 35:32.003
Let's go back to your bedroom, search your
adolescence, even your childhood.

35:32.588 --> 35:37.425
Review all those moments
that were... weird.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.971
Weird? What do you mean weird?

35:41.139 --> 35:44.307
We're looking for someone in a hood, Roy.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.243
I hear voices.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.455
Where?

36:09.876 --> 36:12.627
Behind the door.
Whispering.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.299
Which door are you talking about.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.511
It's my old room.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.015
It's opening.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.810
I... I see them.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.980
Wearing hoods.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.192
Can you see your father?

36:36.068 --> 36:39.237
I don't know.
I can't make out their faces.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.698
Why not? Make up, maybe?

36:42.700 --> 36:46.328
Yeah... they look like... witches.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.830
What are they doing?

36:52.501 --> 36:54.586
Come on, you know.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.088
I don't know...

36:57.256 --> 37:01.509
It's not what you think Roy.
It's what you don't want to think.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.478
I don't know...

37:15.524 --> 37:17.359
I can't stop...

37:26.786 --> 37:28.703
Something doesn't fit.

37:29.538 --> 37:33.250
In his vision, Roy saw himself as a child.
Yes?

37:33.960 --> 37:37.212
And the other sister says the abuse
began only last year.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.757
Yeah but see, for me that's the
typical progressive revelation.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.969
For me, what doesn't fit is
he said there was six

37:44.428 --> 37:48.848
people in his room. How do you get six
people in and out of that room without...

37:49.016 --> 37:50.141
The grandmother.

37:50.309 --> 37:53.603
And she had John when she was
barely sixteen years old.

37:53.771 --> 37:59.234
Everybody knew she was into some bad stuff,
I see no reason for us to rule her out.

37:59.735 --> 38:02.028
Of course I should have realized.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.700
Some of us can use
our heads too, Professor.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.602
- What is the meaning of all this!
- Mrs. Gray!

38:34.770 --> 38:37.480
- You already searched the house yesterday.
- Rose. Rose.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.400
- Today they're destroying it!
- You need to stay calm.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.194
- Nobody has explained anything to me.
- Rose! Rose! Listen to me!

38:43.571 --> 38:46.323
None of this is necessary. All right.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.951
I'll talk to Brody and right now we'll
get these men out of your house.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.579
Yeah? Well then why don't you?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.959
You know where the photographs are.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.004
I talked to Roy and he told us.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.720
- You're lying!
- You are lying!

39:10.723 --> 39:13.058
My Grandson didn't...

39:24.528 --> 39:26.321
She's been drinking.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.115
How you doin' boss?

39:31.702 --> 39:34.954
Listen, Brody and I are
going bowling later.

39:35.664 --> 39:38.792
You should join us.
Gonna blow off some steam.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.503
What?

39:42.546 --> 39:44.589
You need to disconnect, Boss.

39:46.842 --> 39:50.762
Yeah, no thanks boys.
Don't you disconnect too much all right?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.643
Are you a police officer?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.353
Yes.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.442
Did you sexually abuse Angela Gray?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.612
No.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.744
- Is today Friday?
- Yes.

40:16.497 --> 40:19.666
- Did you sexually abuse Roy Gray.
- No.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.212
An FBI report.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.757
I hate it when you're always right.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.427
This could be huge Bruce.

40:31.011 --> 40:32.804
A cult of Satanists.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.893
They've suspected it for seven years.
Ever since the book came out.

40:43.190 --> 40:48.361
They shelved it last month,
can you believe it? I mean, take a look.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.032
Rumours about rituals everywhere,
like they're connected.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.952
But not a shred of evidence what-so-ever.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.203
We'll find the proof.

40:57.746 --> 41:01.541
Kate just called me,
if we don't find something,

41:01.917 --> 41:05.336
- we're going to have to release him.
- What? Nesbitt?

41:05.504 --> 41:06.838
It's the law, Bruce.

41:07.006 --> 41:11.509
You mean that this guy is part of a
Satanic cult and we're going to let him go?

41:11.677 --> 41:13.261
Do you know any pornographic
pictures of Angela Gray?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.722
- No.
- You're lying!

41:19.602 --> 41:20.935
Kenner speaking.

41:21.562 --> 41:25.190
All we tried to do was
lift her shirt and she panicked.

41:30.321 --> 41:35.617
Hey Angela, it's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Will you open the door?

41:51.342 --> 41:54.302
Listen, Doctor just wants to
inspect your mark.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.305
What's the problem?

41:59.808 --> 42:02.560
- Would you prefer if it was a female?
- It's not that.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.479
What is it?

42:05.981 --> 42:07.607
Tell me, what is it?

42:11.695 --> 42:15.823
If I show it to you, they'll kill me

42:20.955 --> 42:26.876
You listen to me. Right now it's incredibly
important that you tell us everything.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.379
We think that your grandmother...

42:30.923 --> 42:34.842
Come on there were more
people there, with painted faces.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.803
Why won't you confirm it?

42:38.013 --> 42:39.806
The Devil is on their side.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.683
The Devil doesn't exist.

42:44.019 --> 42:47.522
There's good people, okay.
And there's bad people.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.362
And unfortunately these
people are real scum.

42:54.780 --> 42:58.199
But good people, like you,
are stronger than they are.

42:58.367 --> 43:01.327
Yes you are.
People say that you're shy.

43:02.371 --> 43:07.875
But I don't see that.
I see someone who is incredibly brave.

43:10.170 --> 43:16.384
Someone who has been through living
hell and made it stop, all by yourself.

43:18.178 --> 43:22.682
Now you just need to take
one more step, okay, and trust me.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.604
Now they'll kill you too.

44:28.082 --> 44:30.958
...their headlights woke me up.

44:32.419 --> 44:36.297
I saw them get out of the cars,
and they were wearing robes.

44:39.259 --> 44:41.803
They were headed for my
Dad's workshop.

44:44.890 --> 44:48.184
After a while I heard
a knock at the door.

44:50.020 --> 44:53.606
They were going to break it down
like the other times.

44:54.274 --> 44:55.900
So I opened it.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.860
Who were they?

45:00.781 --> 45:05.660
It was my Grandmother,
dressed like them.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.205
She took me downstairs.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.670
She had this weird smile on her face.

45:15.838 --> 45:20.216
- Like...
- Like she was drugged.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.803
Yeah.

45:25.681 --> 45:29.892
I saw that we were headed
for my Dad's workshop.

45:33.981 --> 45:37.859
I could hear chanting and...

45:41.655 --> 45:43.531
...squealing inside.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.084
It was a black mass.

46:01.049 --> 46:04.677
I know they were
doing stuff in the corners.

46:06.054 --> 46:08.806
Like fornicating.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.392
Torture.

46:14.354 --> 46:17.148
There was blood, everywhere.

46:24.156 --> 46:26.365
There was a woman with a pitcher.

46:27.618 --> 46:32.371
She said, this isn't happening.
It's all a dream.

46:34.625 --> 46:39.212
But there was like this altar.

46:40.297 --> 46:43.841
And my Grandmother's:
"look at your Dad."

46:44.676 --> 46:48.721
"It's his big night."

46:54.102 --> 46:57.730
Then... they brought out a baby.

47:05.405 --> 47:07.949
...and they each brought out a knife.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.952
And they started stabbing it!

47:11.537 --> 47:14.080
And they started eating it!

47:14.706 --> 47:17.166
I know they did this
to other mothers of the sect.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.753
They burned the remains and
buried them on my dad's property!

47:20.921 --> 47:22.630
Please find them!

47:22.798 --> 47:24.549
They got to be there.

47:35.477 --> 47:37.979
...can't alter the bottom.
Okay. So just the grass...

47:38.146 --> 47:40.466
- How long is it going to take?
- ...two or three inches...

47:40.607 --> 47:43.109
Okay, it's very big.
We got to do it in sections.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.570
- How long?
- We got to locate places where ditches...

47:45.737 --> 47:48.457
- How long is it going to take?
- I don't know, Bruce, maybe a month!

47:48.615 --> 47:51.158
You're all about not making any mistakes.
What are you doing? You come down here...

47:51.326 --> 47:53.953
We don't have a month, Farrell!

47:54.121 --> 47:57.373
Do you have any idea
what we are up against!

47:57.541 --> 48:01.711
No, why would I? Why would I, Bruce?
You're the one with all the answers. Right?

48:01.879 --> 48:04.088
You're right. You're right, okay.

48:04.590 --> 48:09.343
Give this a listen. I already have it
memorized. Okay. Knock yourself out.

48:12.764 --> 48:15.308
- What about the FBI?
- It's not going to lift a finger...

48:15.475 --> 48:18.477
...until we have some hard evidence.
So we are on our own.

48:18.645 --> 48:21.731
We got another call.
About twenty people in dark clothes.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.233
- Somebody heard "weird music."
- Send someone over.

48:24.776 --> 48:26.569
It's probably those Goth's again.

48:26.737 --> 48:29.363
- Who do we send, Chief? Everybody's here.
- Find someone, Tom!

48:29.531 --> 48:34.410
Call the D.A. and tell him we can't
keep this up. And shut that damn door.

48:35.662 --> 48:38.247
All right. Professor Raines?

48:39.416 --> 48:42.543
Well John is responding well to therapy.

48:42.711 --> 48:46.589
But he hasn't been able to identify
any of the faces that he's sees.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.592
- You think he's trying to buy time?
- No, no. I don't think so.

48:50.135 --> 48:54.096
You know Chief, I don't think he's telling
us everything. Let me talk to him a bit.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.973
Work him, try to get
something out of him.

48:56.141 --> 48:59.310
You don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your mouth closed.

49:00.228 --> 49:03.773
Angela, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

49:04.858 --> 49:06.567
I was looking for you.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.653
All right. Well...

49:14.534 --> 49:16.327
Please. Sit down.

49:25.003 --> 49:28.255
- You're not going to believe me.
- What happened?

49:29.841 --> 49:31.384
I think they were following me.

49:31.927 --> 49:35.096
- Just now as I was leaving the bookstore.
- Well who was?

49:35.263 --> 49:37.682
I don't know who they are. But...

49:39.142 --> 49:42.895
I could feel 'em mixed in with
everyone on the street. Just...

49:43.438 --> 49:44.981
Watching me.

49:47.109 --> 49:50.069
- You don't believe me.
- It's not that, Angela.

49:50.237 --> 49:52.405
Please. Sit down.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.157
Half the city is in shock right now.

49:56.243 --> 49:59.453
I went to your father's
workshop the other day.

50:00.956 --> 50:04.792
And I saw everything.
I was terrified.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.379
It was just suggestion.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.467
My mother was followed.

50:14.636 --> 50:17.054
She told me just before the accident.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.642
Your brother told us.

50:23.979 --> 50:26.814
- I should get your statement.
- I don't want to burden anyone.

50:26.982 --> 50:30.026
You're not a burden.
All right, it's my job to protect you.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.778
Let me go get my recorder,
and I'll be right back.

50:55.218 --> 50:56.761
You okay?

51:08.273 --> 51:11.067
- Thank you but I...
- It's to protect you.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.864
All right. I appreciate it.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.576
My Dad said you were a jerk.

51:21.411 --> 51:24.038
That you always complained
when he fixed your car.

51:24.206 --> 51:26.957
Sometimes I get pissed off
when people don't do their job well.

51:27.626 --> 51:30.753
I'm not exactly what you
might call a nice guy. You know?

51:30.921 --> 51:32.129
Yes you are.

51:34.424 --> 51:35.966
To me, at least.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.140
- Good night.
- Good night.

51:46.019 --> 51:48.395
And hey, hey. Thank you.

52:22.931 --> 52:25.808
This happened today?
What time?

52:25.976 --> 52:28.894
Around three o'clock.
Between Main and Timothy.

52:43.702 --> 52:47.163
And what exactly did
your mother tell you?

52:47.664 --> 52:50.207
It was one of their tactics.

52:50.917 --> 52:54.336
They blend in with people on the
street and start staring at someone.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.046
What for?

52:57.465 --> 53:00.968
- It's a death threat.
- How did she know?

53:02.596 --> 53:04.388
She never said.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.766
But she died right after.

53:09.686 --> 53:13.814
Sometimes they'd call in the
middle of the night and hang up.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.983
That's a warning.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.443
A warning?

53:17.611 --> 53:18.903
Yeah, it's like...

53:20.572 --> 53:23.449
An invitation. To be one of them.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.161
Shh...

56:25.924 --> 56:29.593
So much depravity.
So much evil.

56:30.303 --> 56:31.970
How...

56:32.514 --> 56:36.517
How does he fool us? Just when
I thought my life was back on track,

56:37.185 --> 56:40.771
my mother and I away
from temptation from the Devil.

56:41.648 --> 56:44.066
That's right when I was closest to him.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.443
You don't know, John?

56:47.946 --> 56:49.905
- You really don't know?
- Bruce.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.574
You had no idea what you were getting into?

56:53.576 --> 56:58.247
There's no Devil, John.
There's only you. You're the Devil.

56:58.957 --> 57:02.584
What about your wife?
You ready to confess to killing her?

57:02.752 --> 57:06.422
- No... I didn't... It was an accident.
- Bull shit!

57:06.798 --> 57:10.050
The threats, the anonymous phone calls.
People stalking her.

57:10.218 --> 57:12.428
You didn't know anything about that.

57:12.595 --> 57:16.348
Quit praying and drawing things
and give me names!

57:18.059 --> 57:20.727
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- What are you talking about?

57:20.895 --> 57:23.522
This case is affecting everyone.
And you as well.

57:23.690 --> 57:25.566
No need to play the tough guy.

57:25.733 --> 57:31.155
Half the cops on this case are dragging ass
because I put one of our own behind bars.

57:31.656 --> 57:35.659
The other half are complete idiots
to begin with. That's what's affecting me.

57:35.827 --> 57:38.245
What about the nightmares?

57:40.248 --> 57:43.417
Are you going to tell me
you're the only one not having any?

57:43.585 --> 57:45.169
No, no I'm having them.

57:45.336 --> 57:48.172
Luckily we all have you
to take care of us Professor.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.720
Angela.

57:57.432 --> 58:02.478
Clear something up for me and...
these gentlemen.

58:05.315 --> 58:08.609
Why did you let the Reverend
tell me what your father did.

58:08.776 --> 58:12.279
Why? If you already
knew I was involved?

58:16.784 --> 58:18.994
Because you don't
remember, Grandma.

58:21.664 --> 58:24.416
I thought I was going crazy.

58:24.918 --> 58:28.587
Because you'd walk around as if...

58:30.215 --> 58:31.840
everything was normal.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.887
But then I realized...

58:40.058 --> 58:41.266
That's a lie!

58:41.434 --> 58:43.685
Hey. Rose. Rose.

58:43.853 --> 58:47.814
I want to talk to my grandson!
Talk to Roy! He knows me!

58:47.982 --> 58:50.442
He knows that I would
never do such a thing.

58:50.610 --> 58:55.531
Listen Rose, it's your own son that's
telling us, Rose. You understand that?

58:56.241 --> 58:58.534
Take another look
at John's drawings

58:58.701 --> 59:01.620
- and see if there's something...
- I don't kill babies!

59:01.788 --> 59:02.788
I know who I am.

59:02.956 --> 59:06.041
I think you and I
should go on with the therapy.

59:07.335 --> 59:11.129
You just don't...
just don't remember.

59:11.506 --> 59:16.468
- I know who I am!
- I know who I am!

59:18.304 --> 59:21.181
I think I better take you home.

59:23.184 --> 59:25.102
Come Rose.

59:26.521 --> 59:28.397
You will pay for this!

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:25.662
You were right.
This case is getting to me.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.292
Since we've had
absolutely no progress.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.129
Nothing. This is impossible.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:37.507
There are too many pieces here.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:44.473
John blocked his memories
because they defied his morality.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:50.479
And his son Roy is a defence mechanism.
All right, very well. But now Rose.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.732
You're the one that said
the mind is a whole universe.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.151
Oh God I say that crap sometimes.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:05.077
What about from a
non-scientific standpoint?

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:10.082
Non-scientific.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.670
What are you implying -
that we were all possessed by the Devil?

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.089
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.067
It wasn't you, Rose.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.404
It was his will.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.616
And he is the one we're up against.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:02:00.382
You can't be too careful. The men and women
who have sworn to serve Satan

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.885
will do anything to spread
the fear among us.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.513
No one can...

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.476
Yeah Chief, I'm watching it.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:17.858
Who is this?

01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:22.904
Hello?

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.451
Hello?

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:31.329
...I saw them kill
all kinds of animals.

01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:35.375
One time I even saw them sacrifice...

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.211
...a baby.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:42.507
I know they took photos
and videotaped it.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:55.270
We recall the case
in Jordan, Minnesota.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.981
And the case of Paul Ingram,
in Olympia, Washington.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.275
Who was accused of
being a Satanist.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.779
This could mean that
Satanic activity has branched out.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.991
Creating a network that is
terrifying as it is invisible.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.286
We asked Professor Jennings,
an expert in Demonology

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:15.081
to explain to us, what exactly we're up
against when we talk about Satan.

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:19.044
Well that's the problem.
We think we live in modern times,

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:22.589
protected in our homes,
with alarms and our modern cars.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.466
But it's the eternal battle.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.428
The Devil will do everything
to make us forget that he exists.

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:32.766
It's easier to fall into his trap when you
don't suspect his existence.

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:37.312
Do you believe
the Devil is a real entity...

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.439
Lacy?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.782
Lacy?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.665
Lacy?

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.545
Lacy?

01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:05.173
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:10.512
Lacy?

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:15.350
Kitty-kitty-kitty.
Come on kitty.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:19.980
What's wrong with you?

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:22.566
You silly cat.
Come out of there.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.110
Come on will you.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.405
Come on Lacy.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.406
Oh God in heaven, hallowed be thy name!
Thy kingdom come...

01:05:15.369 --> 01:05:17.537
You filthy liar!

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:21.416
We know what you did! You killed a baby!

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.835
Fucking bitch!

01:05:29.216 --> 01:05:31.468
You're a filthy liar!

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:35.931
You know what you did!
You killed a baby!

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.895
Whore! Whore!

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:06.628
Did you look at that window?

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.089
Looks like she was trying to get away.

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:11.132
See, what did I tell you, man.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.426
The somebody pushed her.
And the house is clean.

01:06:13.594 --> 01:06:15.637
You know exactly what I said.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.722
What's going on, Charlie?

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:22.727
Boss, I never really believe
in this sort of stuff.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.604
But?

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.941
But I'm starting to think this won't help.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.612
Those people are just flesh and bone.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.240
I'm not talking about people, Boss.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:53.133
We're waiting for her to confess.
So right now she'll stay in the hospital.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:56.678
- I feel like this is all my fault.
- No, God...

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:01.433
It's true. I've ruined their lives, Bruce.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.644
- Please don't say that again.
- You don't understand.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.022
I know I should hate them.

01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:10.608
But they're my family.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.159
I talk to her every day.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.038
She left us.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.332
All of us.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.252
Despite everything my Dad
put her through.

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:37.135
You don't believe, do you?
In praying.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.349
I believe in you, Angela. I do.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:46.352
I really do.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.280
You're all I've got, Bruce.

01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:10.001
- Sorry.
- Angela, I'm sorry.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:16.341
- I've never...
- Now listen.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.763
Listen, forgive me, okay.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.814
What are you doing, Bruce?

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.399
What are you doing?

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.841
Roy...

01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:01.136
Oh Roy.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:09.144
Grandma, what happened?

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.897
They hounded me.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:21.029
So I wouldn't tell,
what I did to you.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:25.743
Grandma, you never did anything to me.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.871
You were always good to
me.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.165
Accepted me as I am.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:33.877
Horrible things.

01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:36.462
Horrible things...

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.300
I know that now.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.685
Don't talk to her anymore.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.645
- You're making her crazy.
- What happened?

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:56.399
- You really think she saw the Devil?
- Roy.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:59.235
She suffered a
spontaneous regression.

01:09:59.403 --> 01:10:02.197
Now we need to separate
the real from the imagined.

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.365
She started drinking again,
she's delirious.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.326
- Roy.
- You're a fraud.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.206
Just like him.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:13.499
You think I don't remember?

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:17.003
Always preaching, sticking your nose into
other people's lives,

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:20.048
like you did with mine!
You and your fucking church!

01:10:21.258 --> 01:10:23.843
I'm very sorry you feel that way, Roy.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:28.139
Will you at least come
and see your sister?

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.979
I should go.

01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:39.984
I got a better idea.
Why don't all of your just go.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.737
Leave us alone.

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:59.170
He's only trying to protect Rose.
We have to talk to him again.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.881
You don't know what
you're up against.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:05.510
Don't you see it?
He's with them now.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.304
And I don't think even he knows it.

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.474
- All of this is Satan's work.
- Oh come on.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.601
I'm talking about evil.

01:11:14.561 --> 01:11:18.606
- Evil itself.
- Evil itself? Listen, Reverend.

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:23.695
No. The Devil will do
the same thing to you.

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:28.616
As he's doing to John's family.
He'll find a way to confuse you.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.994
To tempt you.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.752
I've already handed out
quite a few at the station.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.505
- You did what?
- It can't do any harm.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.349
Good night.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.771
- Why don't you just admit it?
- Admit what?

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:00.940
That you're scared to death.

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.569
You're not using your head anymore.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:07.405
Raines...

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:44.942
And what exactly did
your mother tell you?

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:47.653
It was one of their tactics.

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:51.199
They blend in with people on the street
and start staring at someone.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.909
What for?

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.829
It's a death threat.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.892
Hello?

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.107
Hello?

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:27.819
Listen I am sick...

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:51.342
Sometimes they'd call
in the middle of the night and hang up.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.302
That's a warning.

01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:56.347
- A warning?
- Yeah, it's like...

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.936
an invitation to be one of them.

01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:10.736
Bruce?

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.657
Are you all right?

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.957
- Where am I...
- Shh...

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.837
Tell them he's ready.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.719
Nesbitt...

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.390
- This can't be real.
- Of course it's not real.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.851
- You're in custody.
- It's not happening, Bruce.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:44.228
- This is a dream.
- Come on.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.524
Walk slowly.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.821
Hold him,
he's still a bit dizzy.

01:14:56.533 --> 01:15:00.286
- Watch your step, Bruce.
- What are you all doing in my house?

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.622
- Let him through.
- Get out of my house.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.707
Make way. Make way.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.460
- Get out of my house!
- This is not your house.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.182
You're dreaming, Bruce.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.937
This isn't real.

01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.278
Give him the knife.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.187
No! No!

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.399
No! No!

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.367
Don't cry sweetheart.

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:26.998
It's only a dream.
Our secret recipe.

01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:31.127
Go on. Drink.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:34.839
I'm not one of you!

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:40.553
I'm not one of you!
I'm not one of you!

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:20.009
Come on Lady.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.523
Tough luck.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.951
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.207
Come on.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.434
Morning.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:27.326
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here!

01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:29.662
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus Christ, Bruce!

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.997
This man is under arrest! Get off me!

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:35.501
Who authorized his release!
Get the fuck off me!

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.422
He came here to pick up his stuff.

01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:42.508
They released him
yesterday afternoon.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.552
I tried to call you
but you never answered.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.806
- But why! Why did you release him?
- He passed the polygraph twice.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:51.183
- Polygraph...
- We had no choice.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.019
- That's the deal we had with his lawyer...
- What deal?

01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:56.856
I know he's lying, Chief! I know it.

01:18:57.023 --> 01:19:00.943
Bruce, relax. Relax okay.
He'll never work here again.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.739
Look. Look.
May I? It's not just the test.

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.658
We got back the results
of Angela's medical report.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:11.412
And the mark's superficial, it was recent,
it was probably self-inflicted.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.248
- I saw... I saw...
- Oh for Christ's sake. You're not a doctor.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.501
- But I saw...
- You saw wrong.

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:20.004
It's typical in trauma victims to want to

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.799
strengthen their testimony
by adding little details.

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.926
Do we know who signed this report?

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:29.138
- Bruce.
- No, they already be among us!

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.474
I don't believe any of it.

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:36.020
I got my hands full with these guys.
Please, don't let all this get to you.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.022
- Not to you.
- What...

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:41.484
You said you were being
watched on the street today.

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:46.363
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror recently?

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:55.331
Why don't you just go home and
forget about the case for a few days.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.625
Something's happening to you.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:41.877
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October the fourteenth, 1990.

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:45.256
- State your full name.
- John Gray.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:59.728
- ...hugging or kissing me...
- So she's been avoiding you?

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:02.439
Yeah. And also...

01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:06.735
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your hat off.

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:24.044
Yeah and then also...

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:27.339
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your hat...

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.762
Shit.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.373
- She's been avoiding you?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.375
And then also the...

01:22:03.543 --> 01:22:06.086
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your...

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:10.716
You were making a list of things
that were obvious and I cut you off.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.719
What was it you were going to say?
What made you feel guilty.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.974
Well I think it had to
do with my son, Roy.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:24.521
He's umm...
Just saying the word makes me sick.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.649
What word?

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:29.068
He's a sodomite.

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.195
He's a what?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.113
That's why I kicked him out.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.741
That means he's gay?

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:40.079
No... well at church we
call them sodomites.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:44.959
Those are sins that people
always learn from some pervert.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.545
And then when Angela
started accusing me,

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:55.135
I... I saw it clearly. It was me.
I was the pervert.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.221
Wait a second.

01:22:59.432 --> 01:23:03.894
Are you telling me that you're taking the
blame for sexually abusing your daughter

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:05.771
- because your son is gay?
- Yeah.

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.650
John, and you waited
to tell me that until now!

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.027
- Why... Why are you angry?
- Now you tell me!

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:14.989
- Why are you so angry?
- Oh God, John!

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:18.158
- I'm only trying to help you.
- Bullshit you're trying to help me!

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.202
- Are you playing games with me?
- No sir!

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.496
Hey look at me,
are you playing games!

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.915
No, I never lied to you. sir!

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.297
You don't think I want to put an end
to all of this? I'd do anything, Bruce.

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:36.593
Anything to pay for what I've done.

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:45.394
To my children.
And I don't know what else to do.

01:25:38.758 --> 01:25:40.175
Move.

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:44.388
You never rest, do you?

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.807
I have a question.
Just need a simple yes or no answer.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.518
Please just for a second
can you just listen to me...

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.854
Can these dogs please shut up!

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.317
Look at this, please.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:00.487
You see this picture?

01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:05.701
I thought I knew her, I was sure that
I knew her but it's an advertisement.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:09.580
Obviously. It's been up
all over town. It's a drawing.

01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:14.877
Right? But ever since the case began, I've
been thinking about her. I put her there.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:17.504
I don't know her.
She's not even real.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:22.009
What if the regressions
are the same thing.

01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:27.014
They're not memories.
They're fantasies.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.516
- They're induced fantasies.
- Induced by who?

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:35.022
By us. By the therapy.
By police, by the media.

01:26:36.065 --> 01:26:39.234
We bombard them with
the same thing over and over.

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:42.070
And their imagination
just does the rest.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:47.284
We're not freeing their memories.
This is a nightmare produced by all of us.

01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:54.291
- Collective hysteria.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:01.381
It doesn't make sense.
What about Nesbitt?

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:04.676
You know he's guilty or
are you doubting that now?

01:27:04.844 --> 01:27:06.845
No. No. George Nesbitt
is guilty, but maybe...

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.805
- Maybe what?
- I don't know.

01:27:08.973 --> 01:27:10.849
Stop clutching at straws.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:14.728
I'm not clutching at straws.
I'm trying to find the truth.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.980
You're demolishing my work!

01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:19.191
- Okay, all right...
- This is science.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:22.319
- This is science!
- I'm starting to use my head again!

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:25.864
Goodbye Professor.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.712
Nesbitt, what did you do?

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.092
What did you do.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.412
Drop that! Get over there!

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.082
Let me see your faces!
Both of you, let me see your faces!

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.342
You had it coming.

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.635
For ruining his life you bastard.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:16.266
His life? They just let him go!

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:21.188
- What you came over here to celebrate?
- What am I supposed to do now, huh?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:23.732
- What about my career?
- Your career...

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:28.028
Fine. Yeah I made some mistakes.
But I shouldn't have to pay for all this!

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:32.407
You got what you wanted. Two stooges for
your bull shit case! You'll get a medal!

01:29:32.575 --> 01:29:34.993
All right, listen to me right now.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.829
I'm not going to report this.

01:29:37.997 --> 01:29:41.917
This stays between us.
Just tell me what you know, Nesbitt!

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:44.086
- Tell you what?
- What you kept from us.

01:29:44.253 --> 01:29:46.254
What only you know about it.

01:29:51.302 --> 01:29:52.302
Only me?

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:56.139
I told you that day in the car.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.142
Am I right?

01:30:23.334 --> 01:30:24.876
I need to speak with Angela.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:29.756
- What happened?
- I've solved the case.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.135
We've got them all.

01:30:34.011 --> 01:30:35.554
I'll get her.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:45.480
Hello, Angela.

01:30:47.483 --> 01:30:49.025
Did you really?

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.779
Nesbitt gave us all the names.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:57.200
Yeah I know, I know.
I know. Sit down. Sit down.

01:30:57.577 --> 01:30:59.119
You'll be fine.

01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:06.126
Angela. I know something
terrible happened to you.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:11.756
And I understand why maybe you
didn't want to tell me this until now.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.054
Nesbitt said they got you pregnant.

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:25.562
Did they want you to have
a baby for the sect?

01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:31.401
Angela. Don't hold
anything back. Tell us everything.

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:38.116
He also told us...

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:43.288
...that there was a ceremony
where they gave you an abortion.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:55.800
Please tell me they didn't...

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.596
Put a foetus...

01:32:15.738 --> 01:32:16.738
Angela.

01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.001
What is the meaning of this?

01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:31.795
What's the meaning of it?

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:37.050
It means I made it all up.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.555
- Why are you lying?
- Angela.

01:32:42.473 --> 01:32:46.184
You have been playing us
from the start, all right. Was it you?

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:48.937
- You were the one calling my house?
- I didn't call anyone.

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:50.897
You were calling my house.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.275
You know what
Nesbitt really told me?

01:32:53.442 --> 01:32:57.571
He told me that you hate your family.

01:32:57.905 --> 01:33:00.407
That you think they're all
a bunch of drunk losers.

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:04.452
And that your mother killed herself
because she couldn't take it anymore.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.246
That's a lie.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:10.083
You really opened up to George. And then
you guys were sleeping together, right.

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:13.169
I mean, when he told you
he would never run away with a minor...

01:33:13.337 --> 01:33:16.881
And you saw that your life was going to be
like your mothers, you wanted to change it.

01:33:17.049 --> 01:33:19.342
Why were you crying
that day at the seminar?

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:22.387
I already told you why,
her father raped her.

01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:26.099
No. Can I talk to you for a second.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:30.395
- What are you doing?
- Just come, speak with me for one second.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:34.566
Next time you hear
the voice of God, don't call us.

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:36.610
Are you out of your mind!

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:39.696
Open this door right now! Mr. Kenner!

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:41.384
You just told us
what we wanted to hear

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.534
while getting rid of your family.
Isn't that right Angela?

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:48.747
Then you went too far,
and now you can't stop. Isn't that right?

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:57.047
Who's going to believe you, Bruce?

01:33:58.382 --> 01:34:02.385
Especially when I tell everyone
what you did in the cemetery.

01:34:03.262 --> 01:34:05.305
In front of my mother's grave.

01:34:12.104 --> 01:34:15.023
You just offended someone
who loved you very much.

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.443
I offended you?

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.529
You think I care?

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:24.199
I was talking about your mother.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.460
Get out of my church.

01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:39.631
You were right, Reverend.

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:41.591
Get out!

01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:44.719
It does exist. Evil itself.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:55.021
Now the police have no leads. Which is very
common in cases of Satanic Ritual abuse.

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:58.525
But that begs the question,
where's the proof?

01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:02.362
The Devil knows where the proof is.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:06.282
He's the one guiding and
helping his henchmen conceal it.

01:35:07.493 --> 01:35:10.120
To make us believe
that he doesn't exist.

01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:15.792
I saw what they did! They killed
babies and sometimes they ate them.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.504
Then they'd burn the remains
and bury them on my Dad's property.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.589
They said they would kill me.

01:35:21.757 --> 01:35:25.927
I chose to speak out about this
so the people would know the truth.

01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:28.763
This is so much bigger
than what it seems.

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.643
I only hope that people realize
the enormous danger we're in.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:39.357
People need to believe us.
Believe us.

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:45.822
That's the scariest part.
We believed it.

01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:52.537
Hey, you did good.

01:35:58.669 --> 01:36:00.211
Let's go.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.039
Angela must've read it.

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:40.627
Or else she saw one of those shows
she's doing interviews on now.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:42.545
Doesn't matter, it's all trash.

01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:46.800
The rest is just outbreaks of panic
like the one we had here.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:49.594
The FBI had already filed all this.

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:56.684
But... I don't get it. What about my
visions, and my mothers and Roy's?

01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:58.394
They all match,
how is that possible?

01:36:58.562 --> 01:37:01.147
You saw what we made you believe,
and we believed what you saw.

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:06.861
We just went around in a circle. The
tortures, the photographs, the sacrifices.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.572
We all just made it up.

01:37:13.744 --> 01:37:16.955
I spoke with the D.A.
All right, now listen.

01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:20.542
Nobody wants to take
the blame for this mess, okay.

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:23.127
They're going to want you
to confess to child molestation,

01:37:23.295 --> 01:37:25.839
but you can't do it
because they don't have a case.

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:30.468
The only one who should
be worried right now is Angela.

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:34.013
No you just...
Leave Angela alone.

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:38.852
Please leave her alone.
First you said I was the Devil. Remember?

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:56.828
All those years, drinkin'
and destroying myself

01:37:57.913 --> 01:38:03.167
and not taking care
of my family until Emily...

01:38:03.335 --> 01:38:06.588
John. You have to stop punishing yourself.

01:38:06.922 --> 01:38:09.424
Emily gave up.
My wife gave up.

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:15.305
And Angela never complained.
She never said anything.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.974
All this hate now.

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.936
It's my fault.

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:29.152
- I'm the one that made her into this.
- I am the one who failed you.

01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:35.074
Don't you see? From the beginning,
I couldn't see what was happening.

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:38.578
I thought that this case...

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.540
That I was the only one...

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.586
I was so stupid, John.

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:52.508
Please. Please, you have to at least
let me help you get out of here.

01:38:56.931 --> 01:39:01.392
- You really want to help me?
- Yes.

01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:05.897
Then you tell the D.A.
that I plead guilty.

01:39:06.065 --> 01:39:08.858
No. John, you'll get
a minimum of five years.

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:14.447
I don't care, doesn't matter. As long as
you leave Angela alone. Don't go after her.

01:39:17.826 --> 01:39:21.204
She'll realize I'm doing this for her,
to protect her.

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.706
And that way, maybe...

01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:28.336
Maybe one day she'll hate me less.

01:39:30.381 --> 01:39:33.132
And that's all I want, see?
