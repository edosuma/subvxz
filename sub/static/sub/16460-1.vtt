01:23.200 --> 01:26.829
My name is Boy,
and welcome to my interesting world.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.325
My favourite person
is Michael Jackson.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.000
He is the best singer and dancer
in the world.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.640
Last month he put out a record
called 'Thriller'.

01:35.675 --> 01:37.125
It sold a gazillion copies

01:37.160 --> 01:40.640
and now he lives in a castle
with a snake and a monkey.

01:40.675 --> 01:43.957
He is so famous that you can
even see him in the stars.

01:43.992 --> 01:47.240
I live in a white house
with my nanny and my cousins...

01:47.275 --> 01:51.840
Hucks, Kiko, Miria, Chay and Kelly.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.405
I have a pet goat called Leaf.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.960
I also have a six-year-old brother
called Rocky.

01:57.995 --> 02:01.077
Loser!

02:01.112 --> 02:04.816
He thinks he's got powers.

02:08.555 --> 02:10.972
He doesn't.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.389
Bye-bye.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.960
Yesterday
my nan went away to a funeral.

02:18.995 --> 02:22.120
While she's gone
I'm in charge of the house.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.765
I go to Raukokore School.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.040
I have many favourite subjects,

02:30.075 --> 02:32.040
including art...

02:33.080 --> 02:35.445
...social study...

02:35.480 --> 02:37.285
...and Michael Jackson.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.196
My friends are Dallas
and her sister Dynasty.

02:40.231 --> 02:43.073
They also have a sister
called Falcon Crest.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.380
Dynasty is the only girl
around here with a job.

02:47.415 --> 02:50.680
She does after-school gardening work
for her dad.

02:50.715 --> 02:53.720
Aunty Gracey is my mum's sister.

02:53.755 --> 02:55.960
She has lots of jobs.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.405
She's the tennis coach,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.560
the mailman, the school bus driver

03:02.595 --> 03:04.485
and she runs the local shop.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.200
Aunty, can I have
a free iceblock, please?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.565
My real name is Alamein.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.360
I'm named after my dad
and he's named after some place

03:14.395 --> 03:17.120
where the Maori battalion
fought during World War II.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.565
Dad's brothers and sisters

03:18.600 --> 03:22.229
are Faenza, Tunisia, Libya
and Michael Jackson.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.620
My dad's not here right now.
He's a busy man.

03:26.655 --> 03:29.920
He's a master carver,
deep-sea treasure diver,

03:29.955 --> 03:32.365
the captain of the rugby team

03:32.400 --> 03:36.120
and he holds the record for punching
out the most people with one hand.

03:36.155 --> 03:40.989
When he comes home he's taking me
to see Michael Jackson live.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.991
The end.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.285
Thank you, Boy.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.788
Tane, your turn. Get up there.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.845
My name is Tane...

03:56.880 --> 03:59.605
Young man, you're a liar.
Your dad's not overseas.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.640
- He's in jail for robbery.
- Shut up, Kingi. You don't know.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.680
Yes, he's in the same cell block
as my dad.

04:04.715 --> 04:06.365
Not anymore. He escaped.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.040
- How?
- He dug a hole underneath the fence.

04:09.075 --> 04:10.640
- With what?
- A spoon.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.485
What about the guards?

04:14.520 --> 04:16.995
- Aarggh!
- He wasted them.

04:17.029 --> 04:19.471
- With the spoon.
- Aarggh!

04:25.600 --> 04:28.920
- Bullshit.
- Shut up, Kingi, you don't know.

04:31.252 --> 04:34.326
Look at me.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.456
Look at me. Look at me.

04:37.491 --> 04:40.551
Look at me. Look at me.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.800
Look at me. Look at me.

05:08.835 --> 05:10.285
Look at me.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.485
Go and talk to her, bro.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.600
A man needs to tell a woman
how he feels.

05:14.635 --> 05:16.485
I don't want to talk to her.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.400
Tane would. He'd probably
French kiss her too.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.000
You French kiss
all the girls, eh, bro?

05:21.035 --> 05:22.205
Pretty much.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.520
Not all the girls.

05:23.555 --> 05:24.765
Well, here's my trick.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.605
I tell the girls that
I'm afraid of undies

05:26.640 --> 05:29.280
and when they want me to go away,
they show me their undies.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.157
Act cool. Act cool. Here she comes.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.555
Go do something.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.439
Hey, Chardonnay, want to see
some Michael Jackson dance moves?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.788
He did those moves at the Grammys.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.440
Al, the boy's afraid of undies.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.600
Nits, nits, nits, nits, nits.

06:33.635 --> 06:35.365
Who here has had nits?

06:35.400 --> 06:37.789
Oi, shut up.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.360
Now, who knows what disease
this sheep has got?

06:42.395 --> 06:44.085
AIDS.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.805
Not AIDS, you dork.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.260
Yes, because it looks like Murray
and he's got AIDS.

06:49.295 --> 06:52.680
Don't be stupid.
Kids can't get AIDS... only gays.

06:52.715 --> 06:54.320
He's a gay.
He goes out with Boy.

06:54.355 --> 06:55.485
Shut up, Kingi.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.240
Ohh! What are you gonna do?
Get your brother on me or something?

06:58.275 --> 07:01.165
That picture looks like
Kingi's undies

07:01.200 --> 07:04.200
when he shat his pants
on sports day, remember?

07:04.235 --> 07:05.837
- Fuck up, Boy.
- You fuck up.

07:05.872 --> 07:07.440
- You fuck up.
- You fuck up.

07:07.475 --> 07:08.605
- Fuck up.
- Hey!

07:08.640 --> 07:11.359
Both of you fuck up
or I'll send you to the principal!

07:15.720 --> 07:17.920
Now, who's heard of the plague?

07:17.955 --> 07:20.240
You. Your mum had it.

07:20.275 --> 07:21.832
Fuck you!

07:24.520 --> 07:26.205
Hey, you bloody kids, cut it out!

07:26.240 --> 07:29.400
- Simon says touch your nose.
- Move your bloody arse.

07:29.435 --> 07:32.710
Now get all your crayons.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.474
School's finished!

07:43.120 --> 07:44.155
Oi.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.485
You alright, Boy?

07:47.520 --> 07:48.925
You want to talk about it?

07:48.960 --> 07:52.360
He made fun of my mum.
He's a dickhead.

07:52.395 --> 07:53.965
It's just words, Boy.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.960
People call me a dumb honky
all the time.

07:55.995 --> 07:57.405
I don't go around punching them out.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.320
- Why not?
- Because they're usually children.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.325
That was a good speech you did.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.600
Looks like we might have an orator
on our hands, eh?

08:05.635 --> 08:07.765
What's that?

08:07.800 --> 08:10.245
Oh, yeah, my dad was good at that.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.120
Yeah, I went to school with him.
Yeah, he was a good student.

08:13.155 --> 08:15.873
Like you, full of potential.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.605
Finish to the end here
and go home, eh?

08:20.640 --> 08:25.840
Hey, Mr. Langston,
what does that word mean...

08:25.875 --> 08:27.159
'potential'?

08:29.080 --> 08:32.480
Ah, it's 3:30, mate... I'm off duty.

08:32.515 --> 08:34.436
You have a good holiday, eh.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.560
Touch my brother again
and I'll kick both your nuts off.

08:50.595 --> 08:53.600
Then you'll have none. OK?

08:53.635 --> 08:56.592
- OK?
- OK.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.908
Oh, man.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.960
This one has all got magic powers,

09:42.995 --> 09:45.637
this fella can jump real high,

09:45.672 --> 09:48.256
this fella can run real fast,

09:48.291 --> 09:50.805
this fella can blow things up

09:50.840 --> 09:52.831
and this fella can turn invisible.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.240
Rocky, you have to come home.

10:01.275 --> 10:04.005
But I'm drawing.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.680
Hurry up, fool.
I got better things to do than this.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.445
Finish it off later.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.760
Bloody hell, you're a nuisance.
Making me walk all the way down here.

10:14.795 --> 10:16.239
Bye, Mum.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.560
I want you to stop hanging around
down there. It's creepy.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.880
And stop being so weird.

10:39.915 --> 10:42.377
Hurry up, egg.

10:42.412 --> 10:44.805
Bloody egg.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.440
What are you? An egg.

10:47.475 --> 10:48.845
Rotten egg.

10:48.880 --> 10:53.760
Scrambled egg. Boiled egg.
Poached egg.

10:53.795 --> 10:55.273
Bloody hell.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.405
Crayfish again.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.005
So if you fellas live in the middle,

11:33.040 --> 11:34.960
may as well stay home
because no bloody good anywhere else.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.080
What do you want to do, eh, Leaf?

11:41.115 --> 11:43.525
We might as well just stay here, eh?

11:43.560 --> 11:48.720
Oh, man, had a massive day
at school today.

11:48.755 --> 11:52.077
There was a big-ass rumble at school.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.136
Most of the children were involved.

11:55.171 --> 11:58.160
I wasn't, because I'm a good boy.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.045
I don't like fighting, eh.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.840
Far, lots of things happened,
but what else?

12:03.875 --> 12:07.565
Oh, yeah.
I seen my girlfriend, Chardonnay.

12:07.600 --> 12:12.640
She invited me back to her house
and we had McDonald's to eat.

12:12.675 --> 12:14.485
It was yum.

12:14.520 --> 12:20.160
Why do you like to eat
other people's rubbish, eh, Leaf?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.592
Storm's coming.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.760
Who are you?

13:13.795 --> 13:15.685
Boy.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.860
What boy?

13:16.895 --> 13:18.807
Alamein.

13:18.842 --> 13:20.901
Alamein.

13:20.936 --> 13:22.925
Yeah.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.560
Alright, I'm your dad.

13:26.595 --> 13:29.565
Oh! Hey, Dad.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.085
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.080
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

13:34.115 --> 13:35.845
How's it been going?

13:35.880 --> 13:37.520
Good. How's it been going with you?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.677
Good.

13:39.712 --> 13:41.765
Now, where's Mum?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.880
My mum, you know, your nanny?

13:43.915 --> 13:45.877
Oh, she's not here at the moment.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.840
She's at a tangi down Wellington.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.845
Someone passed away.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.075
- When's she getting back?
- Sometime next week.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.670
Rocky, come over here. Meet Dad.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.645
Dad, this is Rocky.
Rocky, this is Dad.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.800
Yeah, how are you, Rocky?
Good to see you, man.

14:11.835 --> 14:13.245
Too much.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.320
Say hello, egg.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.325
Hello, egg.

14:20.075 --> 14:21.565
That's Kelly.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.120
Yeah, niece, I'm your uncle...
Alamein.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.588
Oh, great. Another one.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.925
Well, these are my mates
Juju and Chuppa.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.190
- How are you doing?
- They're basically your uncles.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.718
So, you guys want a cup of tea?

14:46.320 --> 14:49.835
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, a cup of tea sounds good.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.031
So, you fellas want to come inside?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.005
Yeah.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.525
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.391
Yeah, let's do that.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.520
Seen 'E.T.' yet, the movie?

15:19.555 --> 15:21.680
No. What's it about?

15:21.715 --> 15:23.045
Spaceman.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.840
Oh, space kid, really.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.565
He gets trapped on Earth

15:26.600 --> 15:29.672
and him and this kid fly around
everywhere on a bicycle.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.917
I seen it four times.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.398
Nice house, bro.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.160
- It's a shithole.
- Oh, yeah.

15:42.195 --> 15:43.645
Oh, I don't know, bro.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.080
These old houses are made of
native timber... expensive stuff.

15:47.115 --> 15:49.325
Not many people know that, eh?

15:49.360 --> 15:53.120
I mean, these door handles
are made of copper. Yeah, yeah.

15:53.155 --> 15:54.765
Yeah, if I was a thief,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.240
the first thing I'd do
is I'd take all the copper

15:57.275 --> 15:59.874
and I'd melt it down
in a furnace or a fire

15:59.909 --> 16:02.473
and then sell it
to a copper dealer, eh.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.200
Alright then, I guess
it's time for presents.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.040
Go on, boys, go get them presents.

16:12.075 --> 16:14.165
What presents?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.270
- The stuff from the car.
- Oh, yeah.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.632
I might go give them a hand.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.000
Hey, real milk!

16:42.035 --> 16:44.798
A new TV!

16:47.320 --> 16:48.765
Eh?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.234
Oh, thank you.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.700
- Here, you can have the rest.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.

17:43.735 --> 17:46.800
Now, don't go burning your eyes out
or anything.

17:46.835 --> 17:48.165
Share them with him too.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.800
- You know this used to be my room?
- Yeah.

17:52.835 --> 17:54.645
Oh, well, you can still use it.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.160
I'll sleep in the garage
with my mates.

17:57.195 --> 17:58.718
Not a problem.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.640
Wow, look at that mop of hair
you've got.

18:03.675 --> 18:06.253
I should cut your hair one day.

18:06.288 --> 18:08.832
Make you look like this fella.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.111
I've seen 'Thriller' 10 times.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.273
I did that.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.400
Don't get into the Nazi stuff.

18:28.435 --> 18:29.485
Night.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.080
Night, Dad.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.300
- How long is he here for?
- Don't know.

18:35.335 --> 18:37.960
But we're leaving with him
when he goes.

18:37.995 --> 18:39.645
Why?

18:39.680 --> 18:42.240
Because that's the way
families work, egg.

18:42.275 --> 18:43.760
Is he the same as before?

18:43.795 --> 18:45.085
Yeah, better.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.480
Do you think he remembers me?

18:48.515 --> 18:50.725
Yeah, of course, man.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.085
- From when I was being born?
- Yep.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.878
- I don't remember it.
- No, of course you don't.

18:55.913 --> 18:58.637
You were just a little baby
and you still are.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.580
What was she like?

19:03.615 --> 19:05.605
Not this again.

19:05.640 --> 19:09.040
Well, she was pretty.
She was a good singer.

19:09.075 --> 19:11.917
And her and Dad were always laughing.

19:11.952 --> 19:14.725
- How did they meet?
- At the beach.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.320
She was swimming and Dad
saved her from drowning.

19:18.355 --> 19:20.477
And then he did a carving of her.

19:20.512 --> 19:22.956
And then they had babies... us.

19:22.991 --> 19:25.365
And he can do heaps of cool stuff.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.920
He can dance as good
as Michael Jackson.

19:27.955 --> 19:30.285
And once, when he was a soldier,

19:30.320 --> 19:32.445
all these commies
pinned him down to the ground,

19:32.480 --> 19:36.200
so he leapt out of his foxhole
and just did this meanest haka

19:36.235 --> 19:39.005
and all them commies got scared
and ran away.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.720
- And was he a soldier?
- Hell, yeah! He's a war hero.

19:43.755 --> 19:47.034
He's even got a green beret.

19:47.069 --> 19:50.313
- What's that?
- A type of hat.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.365
Shh. Look. Look.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.790
There's that mental fella.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.680
Hey, weirdo!

20:02.715 --> 20:04.525
Hey!

20:04.560 --> 20:05.725
Come on, Rocky, get him.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.637
- Aarggh!
- Get out of here, you weirdo.

20:09.760 --> 20:13.080
- Did you get him, Rocky?
- No.

20:13.115 --> 20:14.957
Typical, egg.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.915
Not too hard.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.398
What's the Crazy Horses?

20:59.960 --> 21:03.480
It's my gang. I'm the president
and founding member.

21:03.515 --> 21:06.199
Yeah. Crazy Horses.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.645
That's our sign.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.720
It would've been that,
but it was taken.

21:10.755 --> 21:12.337
We're renegades.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.919
What's those?

21:15.560 --> 21:18.313
Someone who lives outside the law,
but they're still cool.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.565
Like the A-Team or the Hulk.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.273
Gee, even these samurais...
they're the meanest renegades.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.440
- Hey, whose is this mean carving?
- Oh, mine.

21:28.475 --> 21:31.637
Yeah. Looks just like E.T.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.920
It's based on one of yours,
but it ain't finished yet.

21:35.955 --> 21:38.437
Yeah, I know,
'cause you ain't done the eyes.

21:38.472 --> 21:40.920
That's the last thing you do...
them eyes.

21:40.955 --> 21:42.445
Do you still carve?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.835
Nup. I ain't got time for that.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.877
I'm a busy man.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.965
Mmm.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.325
Oh, Rocky!

22:01.360 --> 22:03.032
Hey, where you skating off to?

22:05.800 --> 22:07.392
What's that supposed to mean?

22:14.640 --> 22:16.517
What's wrong with him?

22:19.160 --> 22:21.160
You want to go for a ride in my car?

22:21.195 --> 22:22.817
Yeah.

22:22.852 --> 22:24.385
Cool.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.919
Let's go.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.393
Far!

23:05.680 --> 23:07.432
Phwoar! Mean car.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.685
Hey, Uncle.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.615
Who's this, then?

23:13.650 --> 23:15.510
Mouldy Smith.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.678
Well, see you at home, then, eh?

23:26.840 --> 23:29.005
What? Are you going? Can I come?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.840
Oh, I'm busy. I've got
a few things to take care of.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.880
You hang out here
with your mates, man.

23:33.915 --> 23:35.925
Dukes of Hazard.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.118
Hmph!

24:03.760 --> 24:05.520
So he finally came home, eh?

24:05.555 --> 24:07.257
How long's he here for?

24:07.292 --> 24:08.960
Don't know. Not long.

24:08.995 --> 24:10.445
That'd be right.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.659
Has he been to see your mum yet?

24:12.694 --> 24:14.839
- Nah, not yet.
- Fucking typical!

24:16.320 --> 24:18.440
Hey, Aunty,
can I have an iceblock, please?

24:18.475 --> 24:19.885
No!

24:19.920 --> 24:22.400
- Oh, it's not fair.
- Get a job, man.

24:22.435 --> 24:24.560
Oh, there's none left.

24:24.595 --> 24:26.232
You got them all!

24:41.240 --> 24:44.236
- Boy, can I have a go with one?
- Can't.

24:44.271 --> 24:47.232
Saving them for a special occasion.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.360
Hey, was that your dad?

24:53.395 --> 24:54.885
Yep.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.717
Oh, he's got a premo car.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.605
How long's he staying for?

25:10.640 --> 25:13.840
Not long. But we're gonna be
moving pretty soon.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.285
Where to?

25:15.320 --> 25:18.800
Don't know. Probably just cruise
around in his mean-ass car.

25:18.835 --> 25:21.005
Hey, you guys,
I just did a massive shit in there.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.918
- You should go and check it out.
- Oh, yeah. I'll check that out!

25:25.320 --> 25:28.405
- Don't touch, Falcon.
- I want the lollies.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.560
They're lollies for adults,
not for children, Falcon. Pest!

25:31.595 --> 25:33.685
Wow! What a mean one, Dally.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.756
Alright, we're finished. Let's go.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.839
Tip!

26:04.320 --> 26:07.560
Hey, weirdo, do you live here?

26:07.595 --> 26:09.565
Shh!

26:09.600 --> 26:12.400
Why do we have to whisper?

26:12.435 --> 26:15.200
Because it's dangerous on the river.

26:15.235 --> 26:16.792
Sorry.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.520
I live here with my mum.

26:20.555 --> 26:22.436
My mum's dead.

26:22.471 --> 26:24.317
I killed her.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.956
Do you have any friends?

26:32.880 --> 26:35.660
- Do you have a brother?
- No.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.167
I've got a brother. He's cool.

26:38.202 --> 26:40.640
He's hanging out with our dad.

26:40.675 --> 26:43.640
- What's he like?
- Loud.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.640
Sorry. I think I did that.

26:55.675 --> 26:56.845
Hey?

26:56.880 --> 27:00.800
I think I made you fall over. Sorry.

27:00.835 --> 27:04.720
I have to watch out for my powers.

27:04.755 --> 27:06.165
They're too dangerous.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.714
My brother says
that's how my mum died.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.640
'Cause of my powers were too strong

27:12.675 --> 27:14.471
when I was getting born.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.760
You gotta use them to do good, eh?

27:17.795 --> 27:20.035
Just like in the comic books.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.200
What are we looking for?

27:26.235 --> 27:27.838
Anything.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.005
Quick! Here they come.
Here come the cops!

27:33.040 --> 27:35.840
Quick! Quick! Here! Here!
Alright. Where am I? Here. Here.

27:35.875 --> 27:37.285
Dig.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.360
- Forget it, man.
- Something here. It's right here.

27:39.395 --> 27:40.920
That's where it is.

27:40.955 --> 27:42.365
Not there.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.200
So, I mean... I would've...
I would've run further than that.

27:45.235 --> 27:47.885
- I thought you knew, man.
- I do.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.365
It's a certain number of steps
from the post.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.720
I just can't remember
the exact number of steps...

27:52.755 --> 27:54.485
...or the post.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.640
If we're digging here,
why didn't you draw a map?

27:56.675 --> 27:58.657
I was in a hurry.
Cops were right behind me.

27:58.692 --> 28:00.706
I don't have time
to start drawing maps.

28:00.741 --> 28:02.685
Let's just get a tractor
and dig it up, man.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.320
Yeah, if I want to dig holes all
day, I would've stayed in jail.

28:05.355 --> 28:07.920
You know what... I'm fucking sick
of this shit from you pricks.

28:07.955 --> 28:09.405
I'm making history here.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.160
They're gonna write about me.
You can say, "I was part of that."

28:12.195 --> 28:14.640
Want to be part of it or not?
If not, piss off.

28:14.675 --> 28:16.720
- Yeah, I want to be part of it.
- Hey, Dad.

28:16.755 --> 28:18.657
Hey, Uncle!

28:18.692 --> 28:20.525
- Wave.
- Hey.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.160
What are you looking for?

28:22.195 --> 28:23.816
Something.

28:23.851 --> 28:25.438
What? Worms?

28:26.800 --> 28:28.279
Treasure.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.560
We're looking for a package, OK?
It’s about this big.

28:32.595 --> 28:34.835
Yep. Covered in plastic.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.120
When you find it...

28:42.880 --> 28:45.840
Hey, Dad. Do you know
what 'potential' means?

28:45.875 --> 28:47.497
- What?
- Mr. Langston says it.

28:47.532 --> 28:49.120
Oi! Cut it out, you pricks!

28:49.155 --> 28:50.917
Quit pissing around.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.400
Dad, what are you gonna do
with the money?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.737
I don't know. What do you reckon?

28:58.772 --> 29:01.040
You should buy a big-ass house.

29:01.075 --> 29:02.485
Mmm. Maybe I should.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.360
Maybe I should buy me a dolphin too,
ride around on him all day.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.477
You can have one too. And Rocky.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.560
Yeah, all three of us on dolphins...

29:09.595 --> 29:11.457
...that go anywhere...

29:11.492 --> 29:13.320
...do what we want...

29:13.355 --> 29:15.038
...be anyone.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.359
Dad...

29:19.360 --> 29:21.078
...look at this.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.360
Oi! Where'd you get this?
Give it here.

29:24.395 --> 29:26.257
- Oh.
- Where'd you get it?

29:26.292 --> 29:28.626
- Oh, I found it.
- Where?

29:28.661 --> 29:30.925
On the side of the road.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.040
Hey, you make sure
you find any more of this,

29:33.075 --> 29:34.553
you bring it straight to me, eh?

29:38.800 --> 29:40.995
Straight to me. OK?

29:44.080 --> 29:46.720
Boy! Quick!
Nan's on the phone!

29:46.755 --> 29:48.217
Keep digging!

29:48.252 --> 29:49.679
Where's he going?

29:55.160 --> 29:58.240
It’s not really a gang.
There's only three of them.

29:58.275 --> 29:59.365
Hey!

29:59.400 --> 30:01.400
Mum, it's me... Alamein.

30:01.435 --> 30:03.177
I'm good. I'm home.

30:03.212 --> 30:04.885
Well, how are you?

30:04.920 --> 30:06.885
Yeah, I got you a present.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.151
It's a type of oven.
Only rich people have them.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.515
Uh, when you getting home?
There's all these kids here.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.760
Yeah, we're getting on great.

30:16.795 --> 30:18.432
Hey, um...

30:19.800 --> 30:21.920
Uh, do you think
I could borrow some money?

30:21.955 --> 30:23.956
I'm just a bit broke at the moment.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.925
Oh, it's not fair, man.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.951
These kids get more than we ever got.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.000
Oh, I know it's not a competition.

30:32.035 --> 30:33.480
Never said it was.

30:33.515 --> 30:34.605
Eh?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.437
No, you grow up!

30:37.920 --> 30:40.070
I will spend more time
with those boys.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.839
Quality time.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.565
Eh, look at the skin under here.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.125
Black as night.
You must be part African.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.596
Shit. Everyone will think
Michael Jackson moved to town.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.999
Aarggh!

31:47.360 --> 31:48.859
You! Yeah, you.

31:48.894 --> 31:50.359
You stay there.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.351
Is your name Holden? Is it? Yeah?

31:58.480 --> 32:02.758
Picking on my son, are you?
Want me to pick on you?

32:05.480 --> 32:09.920
Man, I mean, E.T. is one of
the ugliest buggers I've ever seen...

32:09.955 --> 32:12.565
big googly eyes, long neck.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.593
But you know what... on his home
planet, he probably looks normal.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.429
Hey, what's that kid doing out here?

32:29.320 --> 32:31.325
Rocky...

32:31.360 --> 32:32.839
...what are you up to?

32:35.280 --> 32:37.430
Does he actually know how to speak?

32:38.720 --> 32:41.712
Rocky, what are you doing, egg?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.085
Playing.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.829
Well, Rocky, come on, man. We're
going to go to the beach. Come with us.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.560
Hurry up, you egg!

32:53.595 --> 32:55.039
Come on.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.165
Cool.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.714
This is good, what we're doing.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.312
Quality time.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.085
Ah, it's nice here.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.554
I like the waves. They're romantic.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.880
Did you and Mum meet here?

33:28.915 --> 33:30.325
Nah.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.917
We met at school
when we were kids.

33:32.952 --> 33:35.475
Even then, I knew she was the one.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.005
Why? You got a girlfriend?

33:39.040 --> 33:42.460
Oh, there's this girl
that really likes me a lot.

33:42.495 --> 33:45.880
But I don't know if I wanna,
you know, get involved.

33:45.915 --> 33:47.325
Mmm. Mmm.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.400
Well, don't get her pregnant.
That's all.

33:49.435 --> 33:51.245
- Hey?
- It’s the number one rule.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.960
Hey, you can show her your dick,
feel her tit.

33:53.995 --> 33:56.165
I'd be happy
if you just got a hickey.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.480
But don't have a kid, 'cause I don't
want to be a koro just yet.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.445
A hickey!

34:01.480 --> 34:03.880
Well, she ain't gonna touch you
looking like that, man.

34:03.915 --> 34:06.394
You want to dress up a little,
like me.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.679
Can I be on the Crazy Horses
one day?

34:11.159 --> 34:13.280
Oh, you're a bit young, man.

34:13.315 --> 34:15.364
It's more of an adult's game

34:15.400 --> 34:18.120
and we don't muck around
with toys and games.

34:18.155 --> 34:20.076
Maybe when you're older.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.525
Come on. Gear up.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.551
We're going over the top.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.120
Let's get 'em, man!

34:30.155 --> 34:33.085
- Charge!
- Charge!

34:33.120 --> 34:36.078
Move, move, move, move, move!

34:49.440 --> 34:50.793
Ohh!

34:58.415 --> 35:00.480
It’s buried treasure.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.005
What?

35:02.040 --> 35:03.976
Buried treasure, man.

35:04.011 --> 35:05.912
Like a pirate's treasure.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.525
Like gold?

35:09.560 --> 35:12.485
Yeah, but better... money.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.040
- How much?
- About a million dollars.

35:15.075 --> 35:16.697
What happens if we find it?

35:16.732 --> 35:18.285
Then we're out of here!

35:18.320 --> 35:22.600
Buy a house in the city,
buy a big car,

35:22.635 --> 35:24.485
buy some dolphins.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.800
Probably dress up
in tuxedos all the time too.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.925
I don't wanna go to the city.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.420
I bet ya
there's even a swimming pool.

35:32.455 --> 35:34.845
- I can swim in the sea.
- Go on, then.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.200
Meanwhile, me and Dad will be
relaxing in our swimming pool,

35:38.235 --> 35:41.005
riding dolphins
and drinking cocktails.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.112
And you'd better not tell anyone
or I'll knock your bloody block off.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.965
This party's dead.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.840
It's not a party, egg.
It's a get-together.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.805
There's a difference.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.360
Rightio. If it was a party,
you'd know about it.

36:12.395 --> 36:14.476
Whatever.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.820
Rocky...

36:18.855 --> 36:20.125
Oh, see ya.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.680
Hey, you having a good time?

36:22.715 --> 36:24.159
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:25.480 --> 36:27.948
Yeah, your haircut seems to be
a bit of a hit.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.360
- Hey, you want a little sip of beer?
- Yeah.

36:32.395 --> 36:33.952
Little one.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.600
Good?

36:36.635 --> 36:38.045
Yep.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.038
11, eh? That's pretty young
for your first sip.

36:42.680 --> 36:46.600
Oh, if you find any more of that
stuff, bring it to me, eh?

36:46.635 --> 36:48.079
OK.

36:50.360 --> 36:53.989
And can you stop calling me "Dad"?

36:55.400 --> 36:58.358
It sounds weird. Besides,
we're more like bros, you and me.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.079
- Then what shall I call you?
- I don't know. What do you reckon?

37:05.120 --> 37:07.793
- Alamein?
- Maybe.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.780
What about 'Shogun'? I like that.

37:12.815 --> 37:16.040
- What's Shogun?
- Samurai master.

37:16.075 --> 37:17.725
Like a commander.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.760
- He rules the samurais.
- Like ariki.

37:20.795 --> 37:22.520
Yeah, but he's a samurai.

37:22.555 --> 37:23.999
Samurais are better.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.485
Shogun.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.317
Yeah. Oh, that sounds good!

37:31.640 --> 37:33.205
So what should we call me?

37:33.240 --> 37:36.038
I don't know. 'Little shogun'?
That'd be funny.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.279
Hey, Boy.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.925
Oh, hi, Al.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.605
Hey, boys!

37:52.640 --> 37:54.480
Come in. Come in.
Here, have a seat.

37:54.515 --> 37:56.320
- Go on. Sit down.
- Thank you, Uncle.

37:56.355 --> 37:59.056
Nah, nah, nah. Call me Shogun.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.113
This is a party!

38:10.280 --> 38:13.440
Oi, why aren't you out there
making friends?

38:13.475 --> 38:15.005
We don't know no-one, man.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.120
"Don't know no-one, man."

38:17.155 --> 38:19.120
Hey, learn how to speak!

38:22.160 --> 38:25.205
Boy, you didn't make dinner.
We're hungry!

38:25.240 --> 38:27.879
Do I look like your bloody mother?
Make your own.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.599
Piss off, will ya?
I'm sick of you kids hassling me.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.720
Chill out, man.
Chill out, man. It's a party.

38:39.755 --> 38:41.165
- Eh?
- Chill out.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.918
Oh, too slow, you old man.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.039
Hey! Come over here.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.240
Here's a real man, right here.
This is a real man.

38:53.275 --> 38:55.125
Not like you two eggs.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.720
Hey, my son. My best friend.

38:57.755 --> 38:59.165
My main man.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.285
And my other main man.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.180
Who's this? Three main men.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.187
Who's that? The three main men.

39:05.222 --> 39:07.160
Who's that? The two egg men.

39:07.195 --> 39:08.957
Look at you, man.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.355
Oh, come... come on, man!

39:18.560 --> 39:20.994
Oh, man. I wish he was my dad.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.885
I'm gonna be a Crazy Horse too.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.600
Shogun.
What's my name? Shogun.

39:26.635 --> 39:28.272
I'm a shogun!

39:29.760 --> 39:31.239
I'm a shogun!

40:18.040 --> 40:19.917
Piss off, man.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.640
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Chardonnay.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.085
It's Boy speaking.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.077
I was just wondering
if you would like

40:28.112 --> 40:30.035
to come for a ride
in my dad's cool car.

40:34.115 --> 40:35.559
Whoo!

40:46.280 --> 40:47.759
Fetch!

40:53.800 --> 40:55.518
I'm bored.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.753
Hey.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.999
Well...

41:08.080 --> 41:10.960
...you can see my dick, but I ain't
allowed to get you pregnant.

41:10.995 --> 41:12.712
You fucking arsehole.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.396
Look, I got a hickey.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.516
- Man!
- Yeah.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.360
- Dig! Dig!
- That's the way, bro!

41:59.395 --> 42:01.485
Good boy. That's it. That's the one.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.000
Find my shit so I can
get the hell out of here.

42:04.035 --> 42:05.479
Good slave, Boy!

42:06.480 --> 42:09.040
- Not a fucking slave.
- Sorry, bro.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.920
I wasn't really expecting a hickey.

42:12.955 --> 42:15.857
Well, what? It just came.

42:15.892 --> 42:18.725
It's on my neck... happened.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.000
So you go to punch me
and then I block it?

42:21.035 --> 42:21.965
Yep.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.245
Aarggh! Fuck!

42:24.280 --> 42:26.271
- You alright, mate?
- Not now!

42:34.600 --> 42:36.238
Is that it?

43:13.240 --> 43:15.445
Stop moving.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.472
- Just hold still, bro.
- It's just hot.

43:20.560 --> 43:23.805
Far. Mean-as tatts.

43:23.840 --> 43:28.200
Yep. And now it's your turn.

43:28.235 --> 43:29.765
What?

43:29.800 --> 43:32.680
Don't worry, man,
you'll get the kids' version.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.560
Know why I pulled you over, miss?

43:59.120 --> 44:02.860
- Probably can't even drive, anyway.
- As if you can, egg.

44:02.895 --> 44:06.600
- Far, what happened to your head?
- It’s a <i>haircut.</i>

44:06.635 --> 44:10.640
- It's the latest style.
- It's late alright.

44:10.675 --> 44:12.845
Alright, come on in, then.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.360
Phew! This car smells like marijuana.

44:16.395 --> 44:17.805
You shouldn't smoke it.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.320
You'll end up like all the rest
of them dopeheads around here...

44:20.355 --> 44:22.897
laughing at nothing
and crying at everything.

44:22.932 --> 44:25.440
Where you been, anyway?
Ain't seen you in ages.

44:25.475 --> 44:28.405
Hanging with the old man.

44:28.440 --> 44:31.640
- So, who are you here with?
- My mum. She's playing the pokies.

44:31.675 --> 44:33.440
She win anything?

44:33.475 --> 44:34.605
Nuh.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.280
But she reckons it's better to risk
your money on something big,

44:37.315 --> 44:40.829
be real poor, instead of sitting
around being a bit poor.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.220
Far, you've been missing out
on all the fun.

44:45.255 --> 44:47.360
We pushed Murray
off the wharf yesterday.

44:47.395 --> 44:50.005
Ain't got time for that kids' stuff.

44:50.040 --> 44:53.316
I'm working.
Trying to get out of this dump.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.045
When you guys leaving?

44:57.080 --> 44:59.956
Don't know.
When my dad's free, I guess.

44:59.991 --> 45:02.833
- But he's a busy man.
- They always are.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.445
Oh, well, looks like we lost.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.040
- How do you know?
- 'Cause we're going home.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.232
See ya... dopehead.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.110
Weirdo, do you feel sleepy yet?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.436
No.

45:30.360 --> 45:34.160
My powers must be stink.

45:34.195 --> 45:37.960
Maybe power don't work on everyone.

45:37.995 --> 45:39.518
Well, who, then?

45:43.360 --> 45:46.760
Please, Mum, I just need a little
bit of money till I find my money.

45:46.795 --> 45:49.000
I can't wait for you.
I've got places to be.

45:49.035 --> 45:50.957
And don't expect me
to take them kids.

45:50.992 --> 45:52.880
They're too young
to be Crazy Horses.

45:52.915 --> 45:57.045
My gang. Me and my two mates.

45:57.080 --> 45:59.320
But that's not the point.
We're renegades.

45:59.355 --> 46:01.645
Strictly no kids allowed.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.840
Well, yeah, well, you obviously know
nothing about gangs,

46:03.875 --> 46:05.397
so this conversation's over, OK?

46:05.432 --> 46:06.920
I won't be here when you get home.

46:06.955 --> 46:07.909
Fuckin' hell!

46:22.720 --> 46:27.000
Shogun! Shogun!

46:27.035 --> 46:28.797
Take me with you!

46:34.920 --> 46:36.512
Shogun!

46:43.200 --> 46:45.000
Mate, where'd he go?

46:45.035 --> 46:46.765
Is he coming back?

46:46.800 --> 46:49.633
I don't wanna live here.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
- Can I have a go?
- Nope.

47:03.875 --> 47:05.805
You need muscle to do this.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.040
And anyway, this is a man's work.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.845
You're not a man.

47:10.880 --> 47:14.320
Technically, I am. And you're not.

47:14.355 --> 47:16.151
Go on, piss off.

48:25.320 --> 48:32.485
820. 840. 860. 880.

48:32.520 --> 48:36.240
Bloody hell, Leaf! We're rich!

48:36.275 --> 48:38.151
We're bloomin' rich.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.200
You've got some potential too.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.960
We're rich.

48:51.995 --> 48:54.085
Whoo! We're rich!

48:54.120 --> 48:59.765
"Potential. Not now ma... ni... fest,

48:59.800 --> 49:07.753
"or showing signs of ex... is... tence
or activity."

49:10.040 --> 49:11.519
What the hell?

49:41.520 --> 49:43.158
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

49:44.680 --> 49:47.274
I'll take these.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.760
Now, how many iceblocks
can I get for $5, eh?

49:56.795 --> 49:59.558
$5 in the real world
or Monopoly Land?

50:03.320 --> 50:06.000
- Thanks, Boy.
- Don't call me that anymore.

50:06.035 --> 50:08.840
- What, "Boy"?
- Yeah. I don't like it.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.405
Well, what about Fonzie?

50:10.440 --> 50:14.565
Just call me Little Shogun.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.260
- Thanks, Little Shogun.
- Thanks, Little Shogun.

50:17.295 --> 50:19.907
- Thanks, Little Shogun.
- Thanks, Little Fonzie.

50:19.942 --> 50:22.520
No, you look like Michael Jackson
in that jacket.

50:22.555 --> 50:24.960
Yeah, bro.
Scored it from the old man.

50:24.995 --> 50:26.485
There's Holden and Chardonnay.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.360
They're going out now. They've been
French kissing and everything.

50:29.395 --> 50:32.680
Yeah, they've been pashing
at the beach, on a horse,

50:32.715 --> 50:34.125
at the back of the shop.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.196
I heard they were pashing
at the dump too.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.245
So? Pashing's for kids.

50:39.280 --> 50:43.240
Anyway, I'm not here for long.
I'm gonna be moving soon.

50:43.275 --> 50:44.685
Hey, Boy.

50:44.720 --> 50:48.080
Well, well, well,
look at this cheeky fella.

50:48.115 --> 50:49.640
Far, you got your patch already.

50:49.675 --> 50:51.605
Tsk, of course, of course.

50:51.640 --> 50:55.040
Shogun says I have to drink a gumboot
full of beer before I can get one.

50:55.075 --> 50:57.080
He doesn't want you
in our gang no more.

50:57.115 --> 50:59.365
- You pissed him off.
- What did I do?

50:59.400 --> 51:03.160
I don't know, but don't come back
to the clubhouse or he'll kill you.

51:03.195 --> 51:05.960
How's Char-don-nay?

51:05.995 --> 51:07.085
She's cool.

51:07.120 --> 51:09.920
I know she is,
'cause I already rooted her.

51:09.955 --> 51:12.720
- What? Bull.
- Straight up. In my dad's car.

51:12.755 --> 51:15.125
Far, she was good!

51:15.160 --> 51:17.080
You're lying.
I'm gonna ask her, then?

51:17.115 --> 51:19.657
Go on, then. She's a liar, anyway.

51:19.692 --> 51:22.165
And if I see her round my pad again,

51:22.200 --> 51:27.194
I'm gonna make you drink a gumboot
full of knuckles and sandwiches, boy.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.839
Oh, shit.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.799
Boy!

51:38.840 --> 51:40.805
It’s Big Shogun.

51:40.840 --> 51:44.196
Shogun, you came back.
Look, look what I found.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.965
Take it off!

51:48.000 --> 51:50.468
Take it off. Take... it... off!

51:51.680 --> 51:53.300
Who said you could steal my jacket?

51:53.335 --> 51:54.885
- Nobody.
- That's right... nobody.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.680
Now, where'd you get
that iceblock, hey?

51:56.715 --> 51:58.717
Where'd you get the money
for that iceblock?

51:58.752 --> 52:00.720
Answer me.
Where did you get that iceblock from?

52:00.755 --> 52:02.645
Alamein!

52:02.680 --> 52:05.005
What the hell is your problem, bro?

52:05.040 --> 52:07.165
What's wrong with you?
I'm teaching him a lesson.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.120
What? He's fine. You're the one
who needs to sort it out, bro!

52:10.155 --> 52:11.680
He needs to learn
about not stealing!

52:11.715 --> 52:13.697
You are such a frickin' egg.

52:13.732 --> 52:15.645
Oh, you are. You're a major egg.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.485
What the hell
did she see in you, eh?

52:17.520 --> 52:20.140
- Ah, shut your face.
- Still a bloody nuisance!

52:20.175 --> 52:22.760
I know you are, said you are.
What am I?

52:25.360 --> 52:27.920
Out of my way, you!

52:40.840 --> 52:43.280
- Are you right, Boy?
- Don't worry about it, bro.

52:43.315 --> 52:44.759
Want my iceblock?

54:41.360 --> 54:44.205
Sorry about today, B.

54:44.240 --> 54:47.120
I'm under a lot of stress
at the moment.

54:47.155 --> 54:48.565
Got a lot going on, you know?

54:48.600 --> 54:50.720
People trying to bring me down
and shit.

54:50.755 --> 54:53.393
The government, mainly, and others.

54:54.440 --> 54:58.000
And I'm getting frustrated,
you know, I can't find my shit.

54:58.035 --> 55:00.880
I'm sorry I am like I am sometimes.

55:00.915 --> 55:02.325
I get angry.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.800
A bit like the Hulk. He gets angry.

55:05.835 --> 55:07.725
He's usually helping people,

55:07.760 --> 55:10.480
but sometimes he loses control,
but he's not a bad guy.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.710
Mainly he's a good guy.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.998
Think you can handle having
The Incredible Hulk for a dad?

55:18.240 --> 55:19.992
Yep.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.590
I love you. See ya.

55:30.600 --> 55:33.520
- All good, bro?
- Yeah, bro. Good.

55:33.555 --> 55:36.512
Far.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.645
LEAF!

57:03.680 --> 57:06.513
Eh?

57:09.320 --> 57:10.958
Where are the doorknobs?

57:20.160 --> 57:23.630
- Al, stop cooking the doorknobs.
- Shush.

57:31.520 --> 57:33.620
Ooh, I'm telling.

57:33.655 --> 57:35.720
What's going on in here?

57:35.755 --> 57:37.437
What's that smell?

57:37.472 --> 57:39.120
- Doorknobs.
- Bacon.

57:39.155 --> 57:40.565
Bacon?

57:40.600 --> 57:43.600
Even though he's hideous as,
he's still got some cool powers.

57:43.635 --> 57:45.757
He's got the light in his stomach.

57:45.792 --> 57:47.845
I don't really know what it's for,

57:47.880 --> 57:51.260
but when he's happy,
shit, it gets bright as!

57:51.295 --> 57:54.640
And the best thing about him
is his finger.

57:54.675 --> 57:56.765
And it can heal all wounds,

57:56.800 --> 58:02.320
be it a gash or cut on your neck,
heartache.

58:02.355 --> 58:03.885
Hey, Shogun.

58:03.920 --> 58:07.117
Well, he'll fix that up, no problem.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.765
Find anything yet?

58:09.800 --> 58:12.680
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're just digging
for fun now, eh, Rocky?

58:17.840 --> 58:20.160
- Hey, um, Shogun?
- Yeah?

58:20.195 --> 58:22.445
- What if it's gone?
- Hmm?

58:22.480 --> 58:25.360
The, um, treasure.
What if someone's taken it?

58:25.395 --> 58:27.954
Who? WHO?

58:29.120 --> 58:32.240
- Who? Man, I'll fuckin' kill them.
- I don't know.

58:32.275 --> 58:34.800
Where's my money?!

58:36.600 --> 58:38.397
Fuck.

58:40.360 --> 58:42.040
It's not fair, man.

58:42.075 --> 58:44.156
It's not fair!

58:45.280 --> 58:50.520
It’s OK, Shogun. We can find it.

58:50.555 --> 58:52.351
We just need some time.

58:53.680 --> 58:56.069
No more time, mate.

59:43.160 --> 59:44.765
Come on, boys, come on.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.500
Come on, man, fuckin' hurry up.

59:46.535 --> 59:48.200
Go, man! They're coming behind you.

59:48.235 --> 59:50.156
Come on!

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.157
Boy! Fuckin' move your black arse!

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.405
Horses!

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.000
Come on, boys, let's bag these up.

01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:11.805
How many bags we gonna use?

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.600
As many as it takes, mate.
Whole lot.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.515
Give us a go.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.999
Come on, then.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.840
Oh, what are you doing here?

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:40.085
I'm allowed. He's my dad too.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.100
So? You should have stayed at home.

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:46.247
- But I wanna get to know them.
- Why?

01:00:46.282 --> 01:00:49.325
Because he's here. I'm like him.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.920
I'm like him more than you.
Me and him have the most potential.

01:00:52.955 --> 01:00:54.485
What's that?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.779
If you don't know it,
you ain't got it.

01:00:57.814 --> 01:01:01.038
That's what makes me cool
and you an egg.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.285
How did you get it?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.996
You get it when you're born.
It's too late for you. Sorry.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.231
Yeah.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.835
Ka-ching!

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.400
- Just fuck him up, bro.
- Yeah, I wanna fuck him up.

01:02:00.435 --> 01:02:02.038
There's the fuckin' pricks, there.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.954
Did you miss me, cousin?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.080
- What are you looking at?
- You ripped me off.

01:02:12.115 --> 01:02:13.837
Don't know what
you're talking about, man.

01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:15.560
You know what you did.
I want my fuckin' weed.

01:02:15.595 --> 01:02:16.549
Hit him.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.279
- Have a beer, man.
- I don't want your fucking beer, man.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.925
That was cool.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.680
Hey, I mean, that's what
it's all about, eh, boys?

01:03:11.715 --> 01:03:14.365
What's what all about?
We got our arses kicked.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.160
What fight were you in, man?
We landed some good hits.

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.120
Like when you smashed
his boot with your nose?

01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:21.885
Oh, yeah, focus on the negative, then.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.620
Eh, Boy, you saw,
it was a good fight, eh?

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:27.320
Go on, tell them,
who won that fight, Boy?

01:03:27.355 --> 01:03:28.685
I don't know.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.760
What do you mean you don't know?
What do you know? Nothing.

01:03:31.795 --> 01:03:34.577
We'll get more members. Hundreds.

01:03:34.612 --> 01:03:37.360
We'll come back, smash them all.

01:03:37.395 --> 01:03:38.565
More members?

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.860
The three of us couldn't smash
anyone. This gang's all shit.

01:03:41.895 --> 01:03:44.667
Yeah? You're out of the gang.
I don't want you in the gang.

01:03:44.702 --> 01:03:47.440
Then there'd only be you.
That's not really a gang, bro.

01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:49.257
That's all I need... me.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.005
I am the Crazy Horses.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.240
I'm the Shogun.
I'm all alone on this planet.

01:03:54.275 --> 01:03:55.525
Shit, man, I'm E.T.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.840
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- You keep your eyes on me, alright?

01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.760
Everybody blaming me
for some shit that...

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.239
Look out!

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.805
What the fuck was that?

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.885
- Fuck, bro.
- It was a dog, wasn't it?

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.760
- You nearly fucking killed us.
- What was that?

01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:15.600
- I don't know.
- I think it was a dog.

01:04:15.635 --> 01:04:17.272
It wasn't a dog.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.320
Boy, you stop right there
and get back in this car.

01:04:22.355 --> 01:04:24.245
It's just a stupid dog, man.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.300
Oh, come on, someone's
just let a dog out

01:04:26.335 --> 01:04:28.307
and it got on the road
and nearly killed us.

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.280
- It was your dangerous driving, man.
- You shut up.

01:04:30.315 --> 01:04:33.405
Now, come on, man,
get back in the car, eh?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.400
Shit, we got to go. We got to pack,
man. We're leaving tomorrow.

01:04:37.435 --> 01:04:39.645
Yeah, we're going to the city.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.925
You're first in
when we get there too.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.238
I'm taking you to see
Michael Jackson... live.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.718
Come on, man.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.471
I knew, it was just a stupid dog.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.519
It's OK, Leaf. It's OK.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.596
It'll be alright, Leaf.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.071
Are we going to the city now?

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.829
Oi...

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.400
...what do you both think
you're doing?

01:07:38.435 --> 01:07:39.645
- We're doing nothing.
- Eh?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.365
- Taking my fucking stash?
- We're just cleaning up.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.359
- Eh? You stealing from me?
- Oh, you know, it was Chup, man.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.045
Shut up!

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.520
It wasn't me, man.
I said it was Chup.

01:07:50.555 --> 01:07:52.000
After all I did for you!

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:55.880
- Hey?
- It was Chup.

01:07:55.915 --> 01:07:56.845
Oh!

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.885
Piss me off, bro!

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.605
Come on, get inside. Hurry.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.829
Fuck you, Alamein,
and your Crazy Horses gang!

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.671
Stop!

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.832
Fucking...

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.620
Fucking bastards!

01:08:27.654 --> 01:08:29.439
Fucking thieves!

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.965
Boy! Boy!

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.309
You've got to come home.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.395
Sorry for what I did to Mum.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.005
Don't touch him.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.920
Where were you, man?
I needed you today.

01:12:15.955 --> 01:12:17.148
I needed you.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.630
That's your treasure.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.397
My goat ate it.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.674
What the fuck...

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.240
You little shit.

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:42.639
Aarggh! Ow!

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.112
Oi. Come on, stop it.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.560
I don't remember you!
You weren't there.

01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:56.497
You weren't there when he was born.

01:12:56.532 --> 01:12:58.400
You weren't there when she died!

01:12:58.435 --> 01:12:59.925
Calm down, man, I mean it.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.080
- Where were you?
- That's enough. Stop it!

01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:03.559
- Where were you?!
- Stop it!

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.480
That's enough, man, OK?

01:13:08.515 --> 01:13:10.630
OK?

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.833
I thought I was like you... but I'm not.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.549
I don't have any potential.

01:15:19.395 --> 01:15:20.554
Nan!

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.032
Nanny!

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.680
- Did he really go to Japan?
- Yeah, he's training to be a samurai.

01:15:50.715 --> 01:15:52.445
They don't just let
anyone in either.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.233
You got to be one of them
true professionals.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.920
Boy.

01:16:02.955 --> 01:16:05.005
Hey, Rocky.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.400
Murray.

01:16:08.435 --> 01:16:10.565
Tane.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.280
- So, what you guys been up to?
- Just out muddy.

01:16:13.315 --> 01:16:14.765
We're self-employed now.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.633
- What's your job?
- Chucking mud at those cows.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.351
How was Japan?

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:11.521
