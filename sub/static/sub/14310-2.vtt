Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.179 --> 00:12.099
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.119 --> 00:15.130
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.030
They were good.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.179
[theme music]

00:22.170 --> 00:24.219
Then there was Gargamel.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.019
The evil wizard.
He was bad.

00:28.039 --> 00:30.089
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.060
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.079 --> 00:36.170
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

00:38.189 --> 00:39.189
Unh!

00:39.210 --> 00:41.159
Ohhh, I'll get you!

00:41.179 --> 00:44.229
I'll find your village some day.
You'll be sorry..

00:45.009 --> 00:47.070
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.090 --> 00:51.109
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.170
And if you were good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.189 --> 00:57.070
of the Smurfs.

What is it?

01:14.060 --> 01:17.019
- Is it food?
- It's a surprise.

01:25.210 --> 01:29.109
I should have known
he'd smurf me.

01:29.129 --> 01:33.009
Hey, Hefty,
I brought you a surprise.

01:34.109 --> 01:38.039
I guarantee you'll get
a big bang out of it.

those silly jokes.'

How can a smurf get any sleep
with you around, Jokey?

Were you ever scared!
I really smurfed you that time.

Hold it. Hold it
a minute, Lazy.

04:55.110 --> 04:58.220
I just smurfed
something delicious.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.100
This is going to be
smurfier than I thought.

He tricked Lazy, too, I bet.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.050
Well, I say we give Jokey
a taste of his own medicine.

05:42.069 --> 05:44.019
Yeah, a big taste!

10:56.139 --> 10:58.090
Are you alright, Jokey?

10:58.110 --> 11:01.110
Yeah, just get ready
to climb out of here.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.090
With Gargamel standing there?

11:03.110 --> 11:05.159
This is no time
for jokes, Jokey.

11:05.179 --> 11:08.120
But this time
the joke's on Gargamel.

(Gargamel)
'Oh, how I hate them!'

12:03.169 --> 12:06.129
'Mmm, I'll get
those miserable smurfs'

12:06.149 --> 12:09.230
'if it's the last thing
I ever do!'

12:10.009 --> 12:12.149
And it may be.

12:12.169 --> 12:14.190
[explosion]

12:14.210 --> 12:16.230
(Gargamel)
'Oh!'

12:17.159 --> 12:19.110
[all laughing]

12:21.080 --> 12:25.190
So you see, Brainy, for once,
Jokey's pranks really paid off.

12:25.210 --> 12:29.100
Yeah. Ha ha. He really
burned Gargamel up.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.139
But does this end
justify the means?

12:32.159 --> 12:36.169
Are practical jokes
ever really a means to a Smurf?

12:36.190 --> 12:41.019
Perhaps, and I only say perhaps,
there is a proper time

12:41.039 --> 12:44.080
and a place
for those kinds of jokes.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.029
(Jokey)
'Hey, Brainy!'

12:50.000 --> 12:51.200
[laughs]

12:51.220 --> 12:53.120
[explosion]

12:53.139 --> 12:55.090
That's not funny.

12:58.049 --> 13:00.080
[theme music]
