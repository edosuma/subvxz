00:01.861 --> 00:04.550
Your sister is suffering
from Japanese encephalitis.

00:04.645 --> 00:07.046
- How serious is it?
- One in four do not recover.

00:07.082 --> 00:08.614
Your age has never mattered to me.

00:08.683 --> 00:09.648
I like you,

00:09.684 --> 00:11.484
<i>and you like me.</i>

00:11.519 --> 00:14.653
You're the first person
I ever fell in love with,

00:14.689 --> 00:17.490
but this relationship isn't right.

00:17.525 --> 00:19.492
We decided to move to London.

00:20.595 --> 00:21.861
What is all of this?

00:27.468 --> 00:29.468
You broke up with me.

00:34.575 --> 00:36.442
(heavy breathing)

00:36.477 --> 00:37.443
(screams)

00:38.546 --> 00:39.512
(screams)

00:40.815 --> 00:41.881
Someone!

00:41.916 --> 00:42.848
(gasps)

00:47.955 --> 00:48.921
(click)

00:52.960 --> 00:54.460
Oh!

00:54.495 --> 00:57.763
- I'm sorry, did the light wake you?
- No, it's fine.

00:57.799 --> 00:58.798
Is everything okay?

00:58.833 --> 01:01.767
Yeah, I'm just gonna go
meet Travis on campus.

01:01.803 --> 01:05.671
We're gonna <i> carpe</i> some <i>
diem</i> over breakfast burritos.

01:05.671 --> 01:06.704
This early?

01:06.739 --> 01:08.639
Hm, tell me about it.

01:08.674 --> 01:10.574
Oh, he better watch out.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.676
I am this close to
leaving him for my pillow.

01:20.553 --> 01:23.621
<i>♪ I step into the light ♪</i>

01:23.656 --> 01:26.557
<i>- ♪ And you fall ♪</i>
- Hey, Luca.

01:26.592 --> 01:28.592
<i>♪ To your knees ♪</i>

01:28.628 --> 01:30.461
What can I get for you?

01:31.564 --> 01:33.464
Blueberry muffin, please.

01:33.499 --> 01:34.598
$2.75.

01:34.634 --> 01:39.437
We, uh, still on for our
usual study session tomorrow?

01:39.472 --> 01:41.539
You know, with as much
schoolwork as we're doing,

01:41.574 --> 01:43.574
we really ought to be acing this class.

01:43.609 --> 01:45.576
(scoffs) Agreed.

01:45.611 --> 01:49.413
I think it's time to tell my family

01:49.449 --> 01:51.549
- we're in a relationship.
- I'm in. Tell 'em.

01:51.584 --> 01:52.550
Well, it's not that easy.

01:52.585 --> 01:54.418
I want them to get to know you a little

01:54.454 --> 01:56.454
before I drop the bomb
so that way they see

01:56.522 --> 01:57.822
what I see, not just

01:57.857 --> 01:59.457
a guy half her age.

01:59.492 --> 02:01.459
You say the word, I will
commence a charm offensive.

02:01.494 --> 02:03.427
And I will find a way

02:03.463 --> 02:05.362
for us all to spend some time together.

02:06.466 --> 02:07.798
Uh, well, I gotta go.

02:07.834 --> 02:08.833
Uh, Stats quiz.

02:08.868 --> 02:09.834
Mm.

02:09.869 --> 02:11.769
You know, it's too
bad we're in public...

02:11.804 --> 02:13.437
otherwise, I'd be able to hold you close

02:13.473 --> 02:15.406
and softly kiss you goodbye.

02:15.441 --> 02:17.408
That sounds like a really
good kiss I'm missing.

02:17.443 --> 02:18.776
It is.

02:21.414 --> 02:22.379
Ah.

02:22.415 --> 02:23.747
<i>(vocalizing)</i>

02:30.790 --> 02:32.690
Hey! Mary Beth!

02:32.725 --> 02:34.692
Oh, Bay, hey.

02:34.727 --> 02:36.694
Uh, how long have you been back?

02:36.729 --> 02:38.696
A few days.

02:38.731 --> 02:40.664
Um, it's good to see you.

02:41.801 --> 02:44.568
Uh, so how was China?

02:44.604 --> 02:45.636
It was great!

02:45.671 --> 02:47.571
Travis, how's he?

02:48.708 --> 02:49.707
He's good.

02:49.742 --> 02:51.709
Listen, I was gonna call you.

02:51.744 --> 02:53.544
Your birthday is tomorrow, right?

02:53.579 --> 02:54.578
We should do something.

02:54.614 --> 02:56.614
Thanks, but I have plans.

02:56.649 --> 02:57.681
Of course you do.

02:59.552 --> 03:01.585
Well, it's nice to see you.

03:01.621 --> 03:04.122
Hey, look, I'll...

03:04.557 --> 03:06.423
You have every right to be mad at me,

03:06.429 --> 03:08.429
and email is not the best
way to tell someone that

03:08.464 --> 03:09.430
you're dating her ex-boyfriend.

03:09.465 --> 03:11.398
It's just I didn't want to say anything

03:11.434 --> 03:12.733
until I knew it was
gonna turn into something

03:12.768 --> 03:15.369
- and it all happened kind of fast...
- You don't need to explain.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.371
The thing is is that I knew
him years before you did

03:17.406 --> 03:18.472
and you've been broken up for months...

03:18.508 --> 03:19.473
Bay, seriously, just stop.

03:19.509 --> 03:20.508
It's fine.

03:20.543 --> 03:23.344
It's whatever. It happened.

03:23.379 --> 03:24.478
Let's just move on.

- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:37.483 --> 03:40.383
I got an exercise ball,

03:40.419 --> 03:42.385
play mats, sorting blocks.

03:42.421 --> 03:43.420
I got the whole deal,

03:43.489 --> 03:45.522
plus I have a trunk full of diapers.

03:45.557 --> 03:47.524
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

03:47.559 --> 03:50.360
I have so much to do
before they get here.

03:50.395 --> 03:51.795
What's with the Jello?

03:51.830 --> 03:53.430
Lily asked me to make it.

03:53.465 --> 03:56.466
Playing with different textures
helps babies with Down syndrome

03:56.502 --> 03:58.435
develop feeling sensations
and motor skills.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.303
Sounds like she knows her stuff.

04:00.339 --> 04:01.471
Well, it's her full-time job now.

04:01.507 --> 04:02.739
Yeah, it's a good thing

04:02.774 --> 04:05.342
old DJ T.K. is making the big bucks

04:05.377 --> 04:06.376
so she can stay-at-home.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.311
I just want to give
her a break this week.

04:08.347 --> 04:11.281
I remember how hard it is
to be a stay-at-home mom.

04:11.316 --> 04:12.449
You know what, it's gonna
be great for all of us

04:12.484 --> 04:14.451
to have that little
ray of sunshine around.

04:14.486 --> 04:15.485
Especially for Daphne.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.454
Have you noticed the
storm cloud over her head?

04:17.488 --> 04:20.757
Yeah, she was pretty shaken up
by the response to her article.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.392
I saw her on campus yesterday

04:22.427 --> 04:24.294
eating lunch by herself.

04:24.329 --> 04:25.395
Where's that Mingo guy?

04:25.430 --> 04:27.497
He's dating someone
else, and you know what?

04:27.533 --> 04:29.766
He's pretty much the one
that got her into this mess.

04:29.801 --> 04:31.368
Wait a second.

04:31.403 --> 04:34.304
He dropped the grenade
and then waltzed off?

04:34.339 --> 04:35.438
Typical of a Shimingo.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.341
- John.
- Well, I'm just saying, good riddance.

04:38.377 --> 04:40.343
She needs a guy with some character.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.379
Since when do you want a guy
in your daughter's life anyway?

04:42.414 --> 04:43.480
Remember how you freaked out

04:43.515 --> 04:45.382
when Bay wanted to move in with Travis?

04:45.417 --> 04:47.350
I'm not talking about
an arranged marriage.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.352
I'm talking about someone to
take her mind off of things.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.387
Throwing a guy at your daughter

04:50.422 --> 04:51.788
is not gonna solve all her problems.

04:53.392 --> 04:54.357
It couldn't hurt.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.393
I broke the girl code.

04:56.428 --> 05:00.363
Thou shalt not date any guy
thy friend has already dated.

05:00.399 --> 05:02.465
Since when do we honor the girl code?

05:02.501 --> 05:04.434
First there was Liam,

05:04.469 --> 05:06.269
then Noah,

05:06.305 --> 05:07.470
now we've both dated Travis.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.372
Okay, that's a good point.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.408
But it's different with Mary Beth.

05:11.443 --> 05:13.310
She was in love with him.

05:13.345 --> 05:14.477
She even lost her v-card to him.

05:14.513 --> 05:16.746
Yeah, but she broke up with him.

05:16.782 --> 05:19.316
I think that voids
the girl code contract.

05:19.351 --> 05:21.418
Well, I still feel terrible.

05:21.453 --> 05:22.452
It's Mary Beth.

05:22.487 --> 05:24.454
I thought that we would
be friends forever.

05:26.491 --> 05:28.425
Well, it's not like you
were trying to hurt her.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.361
Sometimes these things just...

05:31.396 --> 05:32.495
happen in friendships.

05:32.531 --> 05:36.299
There's, like, a... pause for a while.

05:37.502 --> 05:39.469
I'm sure eventually she'll forgive you.

05:39.504 --> 05:41.404
Are we talking about me and Mary Beth

05:41.440 --> 05:43.340
or you and Iris?

05:44.776 --> 05:46.776
Just give her some space.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.445
That's what I'm doing.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.413
Well...

05:50.449 --> 05:51.748
it's Mary Beth's birthday,

05:51.783 --> 05:55.385
and I found this vintage
ukulele on Craigslist.

05:55.420 --> 05:58.655
I'm gonna paint this
on it and drop it off.

06:00.692 --> 06:02.292
'Cause she loves spiders.

06:02.327 --> 06:04.561
It's... it's a long story.

06:04.596 --> 06:05.629
Nice.

06:05.664 --> 06:07.264
- (groans)
- What's wrong?

06:07.299 --> 06:08.698
Oh, it's my stomach.
It's been a bit off today.

06:08.734 --> 06:11.568
Hey, do you have any more
of that ginger root stuff?

06:11.603 --> 06:12.569
Not on me.

06:12.604 --> 06:13.570
On the right or the left?

06:13.605 --> 06:14.704
Kind of all over.

06:14.740 --> 06:15.705
For how long?

06:15.741 --> 06:17.641
I don't know, since yesterday?

06:17.676 --> 06:18.808
Why didn't you say anything?

06:18.844 --> 06:22.579
It was probably that breakfast
that I had with Travis.

06:22.614 --> 06:26.583
I kinda knew that a
lukewarm shrimp burrito

06:26.618 --> 06:27.584
was a bad idea.

06:27.619 --> 06:29.586
(doorbell)

06:29.621 --> 06:30.587
What?

06:30.622 --> 06:31.554
Doorbell.

06:33.558 --> 06:35.492
What the hey!

06:35.527 --> 06:36.626
Both: Surprise!

06:36.662 --> 06:39.529
You guys weren't supposed
to be here till tonight!

06:39.564 --> 06:41.531
Hey! No, we took an early
flight from New York.

06:41.566 --> 06:43.500
We wanted to surprise you!

06:43.535 --> 06:45.435
- Hi!
- What's up, sisters?

06:45.470 --> 06:48.405
- Hey!
- This one didn't sleep a wink on the plane.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.373
- All: Aw!
- I should actually get him down for a nap.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.474
Oh, come on! You just got here!

06:51.510 --> 06:53.343
I know, but if he catches up now,

06:53.378 --> 06:54.511
we can do therapy later, can't we?

06:54.546 --> 06:56.413
He can probably take
a break for one day.

06:56.448 --> 06:58.315
Well, consistency's important.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.382
Of course it is.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.383
Can I get him down?

07:00.419 --> 07:01.418
You two look exhausted.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.253
Oh, honestly, I've got a whole system.

07:03.288 --> 07:04.287
He'll be out in a snap.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.355
Oh, well, we set you up

07:05.390 --> 07:07.424
in my old room, so let's go up there.

07:07.459 --> 07:09.292
- Yes.
- Yup, we've got everything you need.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.696
- Ah.
- Oh, my gosh, he's so good!

07:12.731 --> 07:14.297
- I'm so glad you're here!
- You hungry?

07:14.333 --> 07:15.298
- Starving.
- Come on.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.367
Music to my ears! Let's go.

07:17.402 --> 07:18.735
(laughter)

07:18.770 --> 07:21.738
Oh, look! It's so beautiful!

07:21.773 --> 07:23.306
Thank you!

07:23.342 --> 07:25.742
When did you guys go to Rome?

07:25.777 --> 07:28.311
Aw, man, this promoter's
got me playing gigs,

07:28.347 --> 07:29.379
like, all over Europe.

07:29.414 --> 07:31.314
Um, Berlin, Paris,

07:31.350 --> 07:33.350
- Madrid...
- I can't believe that

07:33.385 --> 07:35.352
you made it to Paris before me!

07:35.387 --> 07:37.387
He's working so much. We barely see him.

07:37.422 --> 07:40.724
- Ah, you got grandpa a soccer jersey. Nice.
- Toby: Oh, man,

07:40.759 --> 07:42.625
the games there are nuts.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.761
I mean, you think that Americans
take their sports seriously.

07:44.796 --> 07:47.297
When you come and visit, we'll go.

07:47.332 --> 07:48.331
I got season tickets.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.633
He's got season tickets, the big man.

07:50.669 --> 07:51.735
Kathryn: Uh-huh! Mm.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.737
And we do have one more present.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.606
Yes, we do.

07:56.641 --> 07:57.774
Uh...

07:57.809 --> 07:59.776
we have a little announcement.

07:59.811 --> 08:01.244
Mm-hmm.

08:03.582 --> 08:05.548
- (all gasp)
- You're getting married?!

08:05.584 --> 08:07.517
(cheering, laughter)

08:11.623 --> 08:13.656
That's all right for you.

08:13.692 --> 08:15.525
- Toby: Thank you.
- Wonderful.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.527
So, are you guys getting
married in London?

08:17.562 --> 08:18.561
It's so beautiful in the spring.

08:18.597 --> 08:21.464
Well, you better tell them the rest.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.499
Uh...

08:22.534 --> 08:25.568
we are getting married...

08:25.604 --> 08:26.569
tonight.

08:26.605 --> 08:28.605
- All: What?
- Right here. In the living room.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.639
We didn't want to wait any longer

08:29.674 --> 08:31.608
and I've never wanted
a big wedding anyway.

08:31.643 --> 08:34.443
And we're gonna have a <i> chuppah</i> with...

08:34.479 --> 08:35.477
because Lily is Jewish, of course.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.613
- Nothing fancy.
-What... what's a <i> chuppah?</i>

08:36.648 --> 08:39.515
It's like a canopy that
couples stand under.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.618
Um, it symbolizes a home
they're gonna make together.

08:41.653 --> 08:45.588
Or in our case, the home
we've already made together.

08:45.624 --> 08:47.788
- I love it, I love it.
- What about your parents?

08:47.789 --> 08:48.610
Shouldn't they be here?

08:48.627 --> 08:49.793
I'm gonna hook them up on the webcam

08:49.828 --> 08:51.594
and then do, like, a separate
ceremony when we get home.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.397
I know this is, like,
really short notice,

08:54.433 --> 08:55.565
but is everybody cool with this?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.301
Are you kidding? We're having a wedding!

08:58.336 --> 08:59.469
(cheers and applause)

08:59.504 --> 09:02.272
- Yes!
- Oh, my gosh!

09:06.466 --> 09:07.565
And...

09:07.600 --> 09:08.599
(click)

09:08.635 --> 09:10.501
you are now officially ordained.

09:10.537 --> 09:11.536
Bless you, my son.

09:11.571 --> 09:13.404
- (chuckles)
- Hey!

09:13.439 --> 09:14.839
How come she gets to be the minister?

09:14.874 --> 09:16.407
It's 'cause of my felony, right?

09:16.442 --> 09:17.642
I will remind you that

09:17.677 --> 09:20.378
I am the one who took the bullet
for Reverend Daphne over there.

09:20.413 --> 09:21.579
Relax, okay?

09:21.614 --> 09:23.548
You: my best man.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.417
Aw, I'm touched.

09:26.452 --> 09:27.818
Hey, let's, uh, ditch the minister

09:27.854 --> 09:29.453
and hit the strip club.

09:29.489 --> 09:31.489
Uh, rain check. I gotta get
Lily's bouquet at the Flower Mart.

09:31.524 --> 09:32.890
Oh, I can get the flowers.

09:32.926 --> 09:35.393
I have to go to campus to drop
this off for Mary Beth anyway.

09:35.428 --> 09:37.828
See? Living up to the title already.

09:37.864 --> 09:38.863
(door opens)

09:38.898 --> 09:40.798
- (door closes)
- Oh, I just realized I have

09:40.833 --> 09:42.800
the perfect thing to wear.

09:42.835 --> 09:44.769
- Prom tux!
- Prom tux!

09:45.872 --> 09:48.873
Okay, it's not there.

09:48.908 --> 09:50.841
Ooh. I...

09:50.877 --> 09:51.809
think I pulled something.

09:51.844 --> 09:53.444
Stomach ache, neck pain.

09:53.479 --> 09:55.746
That's exactly what
happened to you in China.

09:55.782 --> 09:57.815
Uh, not so loud, deaf girl.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.074

10:09.829 --> 10:10.761
(sighs)

10:19.739 --> 10:21.706
Now, I gotta go.

10:21.741 --> 10:22.740
See you later.

10:28.781 --> 10:29.747
(door opens)

10:31.851 --> 10:35.263
(door closes)

10:44.631 --> 10:45.596
Hi.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.599
I don't think we've officially met.

10:49.702 --> 10:50.801
- Luca Barahona.
- Hey, Luca.

10:50.837 --> 10:52.570
John Kennish.

10:52.605 --> 10:53.704
I've seen you around here.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.673
You and Regina sure
do hit the books a lot.

10:57.644 --> 10:59.577
Is that a Fire Magic?

10:59.612 --> 11:01.512
You know your grills.

11:01.547 --> 11:04.482
Best barbecue in K.C.
gets made on that bad boy.

11:04.517 --> 11:06.651
Best barbecue I ever had
was when I was stationed

11:06.686 --> 11:08.552
overseas on the Fourth of July.

11:08.588 --> 11:10.688
We built a grill out
of a bombed-out truck.

11:10.723 --> 11:13.524
When men are motivated by steak,

11:13.559 --> 11:15.426
nothing will stand in their way.

11:15.461 --> 11:17.461
We stockpiled condiments
from the dining hall

11:17.497 --> 11:18.629
for a month to make the sauce.

11:18.665 --> 11:21.465
You see some action over there?

11:21.501 --> 11:22.633
I was a 68-Whiskey in Afghanistan.

11:24.470 --> 11:25.536
Uh, a combat medic.

11:25.571 --> 11:27.538
- Huh.
- (door opens)

11:27.573 --> 11:28.506
Takes a lot of character.

11:30.643 --> 11:33.511
You know, my daughter,
Daphne, is pre-med.

11:33.546 --> 11:34.879
You two might have a lot in common.

11:34.914 --> 11:37.515
Hey, Luca, didn't you get my text?

11:37.550 --> 11:38.616
No.

11:38.651 --> 11:39.583
What's up?

11:39.619 --> 11:41.519
Something just came up with the family.

11:41.554 --> 11:42.520
We have to reschedule.

11:42.555 --> 11:43.554
- Oh.
- No, wait a second.

11:43.589 --> 11:44.555
Luca's already here.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.457
Why doesn't he stay?

11:46.492 --> 11:47.458
For the wedding?

11:47.493 --> 11:48.559
Yeah. Toby and Lily said

11:48.594 --> 11:49.927
they wanted to keep things casual.

11:49.962 --> 11:52.496
Travis is coming. I say
the more the merrier.

11:55.835 --> 11:58.869
Well, if it's cool with you...

11:58.905 --> 11:59.870
I'd love to.

11:59.906 --> 12:01.739
- Sure.
- Great!

12:01.774 --> 12:02.873
So we got a little decorating to do.

12:02.909 --> 12:04.475
Hope you don't mind earning your supper.

12:04.510 --> 12:05.876
- Happy to help.
- Great.

12:05.912 --> 12:06.877
So, I'll go find Daphne

12:06.913 --> 12:08.846
and get you two started
in the living room.

12:09.882 --> 12:11.415

Oh, I miss singing with you.

12:42.815 --> 12:44.582
Oh, me too.

12:45.785 --> 12:46.817
He loves music.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.686
He's just like you

12:48.721 --> 12:49.820
when you were a baby.

12:52.658 --> 12:55.626
Yeah, I play him my stuff
and he just lights up.

12:55.661 --> 12:56.627
Aw.

12:56.662 --> 12:58.028
I'm so proud of you, honey.

12:58.064 --> 13:00.664
- It seems like you're doing really good over there.
- (footsteps)

13:00.700 --> 13:02.566
- Thanks.
- Hey!

13:02.602 --> 13:03.768
- Kathryn: Hi!
- Toby: Hey!

13:03.803 --> 13:06.504
- Lily: Hey!
- So I built an obstacle course upstairs.

13:06.539 --> 13:07.705
There are pillows everywhere!

13:07.740 --> 13:09.607
Oh, that's for gross motor exercises.

13:09.642 --> 13:11.475
We're doing fine motor today.

13:11.511 --> 13:12.643
Aren't we?

13:12.678 --> 13:13.677
Right.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.679
It's okay. I'll get him. Come on.

13:15.715 --> 13:17.648
Whoa!

13:17.683 --> 13:19.617
- Yes!
- (phone chimes)

13:22.588 --> 13:23.587
He's always on that thing.

13:23.623 --> 13:25.423
I gotta make a quick work call.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.458
We're on vacation. Can it wait?

13:27.493 --> 13:29.560
I'll be up in two minutes.

13:29.595 --> 13:31.495
I am so excited to see

13:31.531 --> 13:32.630
- what you can do, Carlton!
- Show her! Show her!

13:32.665 --> 13:34.498
- Come on! Come on, show me!
- Yes!

13:36.536 --> 13:37.902
Hi!

13:39.906 --> 13:42.540
Hey. What's the line on Arsenal?

13:42.575 --> 13:43.574
Yeah. Okay.

13:43.609 --> 13:45.576
Put me down for the same as last time.

13:45.611 --> 13:47.511
Yeah, ten grand.

13:52.552 --> 13:53.884
<i>(muffled rock music playing)</i>

13:57.557 --> 13:58.823
(doorknob turns)

14:00.526 --> 14:02.827
- Bay.
- I know, you have plans.

14:02.862 --> 14:05.396
But I just wanted to come
by and say happy birthday

14:05.431 --> 14:06.730
and give you this.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.433
Thanks.

14:09.469 --> 14:12.436
Look, it's gonna be awkward for a while.

14:12.472 --> 14:14.405
I realize that, but...

14:14.440 --> 14:15.873
I just hope we can
move past it eventually

14:15.908 --> 14:19.810
because I really care about
you and I value our friendship.

14:19.846 --> 14:22.713
Thank you. Um, can I
just call you later?

14:22.748 --> 14:23.781
It's not a great time right now.

14:23.816 --> 14:25.883
Voice: Hey, it's your
birthday! I'm paying!

14:25.918 --> 14:27.685
Come on.

14:33.826 --> 14:34.892
What's going on?

14:38.831 --> 14:40.631
Are you two friends?

14:44.871 --> 14:47.671
Oh, my god...

14:47.707 --> 14:48.772
Mary Beth: Bay, I can explain.

14:54.341 --> 14:56.578
- Bay, wait!
- I cannot believe

14:56.654 --> 14:58.250
that I was beating myself up

14:58.259 --> 15:00.927
over breaking the girl code
when you blew it to smithereens!

15:00.962 --> 15:02.929
Well, wait a second, a
lot happened the last year.

15:02.964 --> 15:04.230
- You were in China.
- Yeah, with Travis.

15:04.265 --> 15:05.298
Is that what this is about? Revenge?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.100
No, of course not!

15:07.135 --> 15:09.268
You never even liked Tank!

15:09.304 --> 15:11.204
You just thought he
was a stupid frat boy!

15:11.207 --> 15:13.240
The dogfight party, did
you forget about that?

15:13.276 --> 15:15.743
Of course I didn't forget,
but he quit after that,

15:15.779 --> 15:17.044
which I respected.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.179
Because I told him to!

15:18.214 --> 15:20.047
Well, can you just let me explain?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.216
Okay. Fine. Explain.

15:22.251 --> 15:24.251
What amazing story is
there to rationalize this?

15:25.975 --> 15:28.109
I walked into a cafe one night to study,

15:28.144 --> 15:29.944
and when I looked up,

15:29.979 --> 15:31.112
the guy taking my order was Tank,

15:31.147 --> 15:33.014
and my first thought was,

15:33.049 --> 15:34.982
"I need to get out of here!"

15:35.018 --> 15:36.917
But then we started talking.

15:36.953 --> 15:39.053
About you, actually, and
how you were doing, and...

15:39.088 --> 15:40.955
How could you...

15:40.990 --> 15:43.057
be with him after what he did?

15:43.092 --> 15:45.092
You always said you don't
know what happened that night,

15:45.128 --> 15:47.028
that you might have said
yes and you didn't remember.

15:47.063 --> 15:48.963
I know what I said.

15:48.998 --> 15:51.098
But you are not allowed to forgive him

15:51.134 --> 15:52.366
for something that happened to me.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.337
You're right.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.874
And if I were you, I'd probably
feel the exact same way.

16:01.310 --> 16:03.911
In a million years, I never thought that

16:03.946 --> 16:05.246
he and I would end up together.

16:07.350 --> 16:09.850
- But sometimes, life happens.
- (scoffs)

16:09.886 --> 16:11.886
And when you started dating Travis,

16:11.921 --> 16:13.220
it hurt me for a long time.

16:14.290 --> 16:16.223
But I had to accept it.

16:16.259 --> 16:17.892
And I really hope
that eventually you can

16:17.927 --> 16:18.959
accept this too.

16:18.995 --> 16:20.261
I can't.

16:20.296 --> 16:21.896
And the fact that
you're comparing the two

16:21.931 --> 16:23.898
is kind of infuriating.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.900
I know that he's not a bad guy.

16:27.303 --> 16:30.237
But any time I see him
or even hear his name,

16:30.273 --> 16:32.339
it just... it brings
all of that up again.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.277
And I'm sorry.

16:36.312 --> 16:39.146
I want us to work this out.

16:39.182 --> 16:40.181
I miss you.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.284
- What can I do?
- You can break up with him.

16:46.289 --> 16:47.421
Bay...

16:47.457 --> 16:50.291
Then I hope you two get married
and stay together forever.

16:50.326 --> 16:52.159
Maybe then it'll be worth it.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.199
- He loves the colors.
- Uh-huh.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.266
We're just teaching him shapes.

16:59.302 --> 17:01.068
What's this?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.236
It's a triangle!

17:02.271 --> 17:03.270
Oh. (chuckles)

17:03.306 --> 17:06.040
He's actually really
far along for his age.

17:06.075 --> 17:07.074
I think he's just a bit distracted.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.076
New environment, new people.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.112
It's usually just the two of us.

17:13.082 --> 17:14.147
So, Toby's gone a lot?

17:14.183 --> 17:16.083
Yeah. I've got my mum

17:16.118 --> 17:17.084
and I have met a few families

17:17.119 --> 17:18.152
with children with Down syndrome.

17:18.186 --> 17:21.188
Community's important,
but I bet it's not the same

17:21.223 --> 17:23.124
as having Toby around, huh?

17:24.227 --> 17:26.026
Look, I don't want to complain.

17:26.061 --> 17:28.162
He works so hard and
it's his dream come true.

17:28.196 --> 17:31.065
Plus, it is really nice not
to have to worry about money.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.100
Isn't it?

17:33.136 --> 17:37.037
I'm sure that's all true,
but if you need more from him,

17:37.073 --> 17:39.073
it's okay to ask.

17:39.108 --> 17:41.142
You count too.

17:46.015 --> 17:47.014
Excuse me. Sorry.

17:51.921 --> 17:54.355
John: Yeah, she put up a
triple-double against Finley

17:54.390 --> 17:57.958
her junior year that was amazing!

17:58.027 --> 17:58.959
Uh, sweetie?

18:01.030 --> 18:02.296
Sorry. What?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.931
Oh, no, I'm just realizing

18:03.966 --> 18:05.866
how much you and Luca have in common.

18:05.902 --> 18:07.935
Um, did you know he played
basketball in high school

18:07.970 --> 18:09.937
before he went into the military?

18:09.972 --> 18:11.906
And he's also a medic.

18:11.941 --> 18:13.307
Uh, yeah.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.942
I think Regina mentioned that.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.877
Well, I'm sure he could
tell you some stories.

18:16.913 --> 18:18.112
(John claps)

18:18.147 --> 18:20.347
Anyway, I'm gonna let you
two world travelers get to it.

18:20.383 --> 18:22.883
This old dinosaur is
gonna check on the ribs.

18:22.919 --> 18:25.186
(chuckles) See how
they're doing, you know?

18:30.226 --> 18:31.859
So, um...

18:31.894 --> 18:33.260
what made you wanna become a medic?

18:34.330 --> 18:37.264
Well, actually, I wanted to be a sniper.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.867
I changed my mind during basic training.

18:39.902 --> 18:41.235
What happened?

18:41.270 --> 18:42.269
Well...

18:42.305 --> 18:44.238
a bunch of us were hanging out,

18:44.273 --> 18:46.307
you know, kicking back,
playing video games,

18:46.342 --> 18:49.243
when by buddy, Ricky,
falls out of his chair

18:49.278 --> 18:51.178
and hits his head, and when he got up,

18:51.214 --> 18:52.346
he was slurring his words.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.315
And all the guys were
laughing, thinking he was just,

18:54.350 --> 18:56.217
you know, wasted,

18:56.252 --> 18:57.318
but something didn't sit right with me.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.153
I took him to the hospital.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.056
Turns out, grade three concussion.

19:02.091 --> 19:03.257
Yeah.

19:03.292 --> 19:05.159
Doctor said if I hadn't brought him in,

19:05.194 --> 19:07.161
he would've had brain damage.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.063
Maybe even died.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.199
From then on, I knew
what I wanted to do.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.134
I didn't want my brothers getting hurt

19:14.170 --> 19:16.136
because somebody wasn't listening.

19:16.172 --> 19:18.005
(shudders)

19:18.040 --> 19:19.073
Hey.

19:20.209 --> 19:22.042
Are you okay?

19:22.078 --> 19:25.045
She tried to tell me,
but I didn't listen.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.047
I completely ignored her.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.084
It's the most important
thing you can do,

19:30.119 --> 19:31.185
and... and I blew it.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.153
I... I totally blew it.

19:33.189 --> 19:34.989
Let's... let's get you some air.

19:39.562 --> 19:41.493
Luca: How long have you
been having the nightmares?

19:42.275 --> 19:44.275
They started right after it happened.

19:45.412 --> 19:47.245
They went away for a while,

19:47.280 --> 19:49.380
but now they're back.

19:49.416 --> 19:51.282
You know, I've seen
what you're talking about

19:51.318 --> 19:53.318
with soldiers coming out of combat.

19:53.353 --> 19:56.387
It could be a form of
post-traumatic stress disorder.

19:56.423 --> 19:58.389
But I wasn't in combat.

19:59.426 --> 20:01.259
The way you described what happened

20:01.294 --> 20:04.262
with how you almost lost her,

20:04.297 --> 20:06.197
you went through
serious trauma that day.

20:06.232 --> 20:09.300
Well, even if that's true, why now?

20:09.336 --> 20:10.401
This happened 10 months ago.

20:10.437 --> 20:13.271
Lots of things could trigger it.

20:13.306 --> 20:16.641
Um, sounds, smells, any kind of stress.

20:21.414 --> 20:24.682
I got in this big fight with
one of my best friends last week.

20:27.287 --> 20:29.654
I don't know if she's ever
gonna talk to me again.

20:32.659 --> 20:34.325
You almost lost your sister

20:34.361 --> 20:36.227
and now you've lost a friend.

20:37.364 --> 20:38.630
Makes sense.

20:41.301 --> 20:42.300
So, what do I do?

20:42.335 --> 20:43.668
Exactly what you're doing.

20:45.271 --> 20:46.571
You keep talking.

20:50.744 --> 20:53.511
John, have you seen Daphne and Luca?

20:53.546 --> 20:54.712
Yeah, yeah. Come here.

20:54.748 --> 20:56.481
Check it out.

20:57.617 --> 20:58.683
Uh-huh.

20:58.718 --> 21:00.652
So long, Shimingo.

21:02.522 --> 21:03.488
(chuckles)

21:04.557 --> 21:06.624
- John?
- Yeah?

21:06.660 --> 21:08.526
Luca's already with someone.

21:08.731 --> 21:10.698
What?

21:10.733 --> 21:11.799
Are you sure?

21:11.835 --> 21:13.701
Trust me.

21:15.738 --> 21:16.737
Are you kidding?

21:16.773 --> 21:19.774
Why is it men your age
can date women way younger

21:19.809 --> 21:21.776
and no one bats an eye,
but when it's a woman,

21:21.811 --> 21:23.578
it's like she's robbing a daycare?

21:23.613 --> 21:24.712
Okay. Point taken.

21:28.585 --> 21:29.617
(chuckles) Damn!

21:31.621 --> 21:32.620
Yeah, sorry. (clears throat)

21:32.655 --> 21:34.722
Luca seems like a great boy.

21:34.757 --> 21:37.491
Man. I'm sorry.

21:38.561 --> 21:39.627
Why didn't you just tell us?

21:39.662 --> 21:42.597
Because I knew you'd
react the way you just did.

21:42.632 --> 21:45.700
And I want the girls to
get to know him first.

21:47.537 --> 21:49.470
And truth is...

21:49.505 --> 21:51.572
maybe I'm still trying
to wrap my head around it.

21:51.608 --> 21:53.641
Hey, I say if it makes
you happy, go for it.

21:53.676 --> 21:55.643
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:55.678 --> 21:57.578
Maybe it's not traditional, but please,

21:57.614 --> 21:59.447
when has our family
ever been traditional?

22:01.451 --> 22:02.450
Thank you.

22:04.487 --> 22:05.453
Yeah.

22:15.531 --> 22:16.464
(door opens)

22:31.414 --> 22:32.413
She's dating Tank.

22:36.970 --> 22:39.420
I... I guess they ran into each other

22:39.455 --> 22:40.755
while we were away.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.757
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
where are you going?

22:43.860 --> 22:45.426
It's not gonna change anything.

22:45.627 --> 22:47.705
Travis, come on.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.775
Do we really have the
right to be judging

22:49.811 --> 22:52.377
who your ex-girlfriend is dating?

22:56.784 --> 22:58.584
Announcer: <i>Rogers on the screen,</i>

22:58.620 --> 22:59.752

23:09.631 --> 23:10.596
(door closes)

23:10.632 --> 23:12.565
I thought you said you had to work.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.734
I was till one minute ago.

23:16.638 --> 23:17.737
I'm doing everything I can

23:17.772 --> 23:19.605
to make sure our son stays on track,

23:19.641 --> 23:20.773
plus getting ready for our wedding,

23:20.808 --> 23:22.708
and you're in here
watching a football match.

23:22.744 --> 23:24.677
It was literally 30 seconds

23:24.712 --> 23:25.711
of checking a score.

23:25.747 --> 23:27.580
We barely see you.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.649
You're always gone, and when you
are home, you're on your phone.

23:29.684 --> 23:31.550
Do you think I like working this much?

23:31.586 --> 23:32.585
I'm busting my ass

23:32.620 --> 23:33.719
because somebody's
gotta keep the lights on.

23:33.755 --> 23:35.488
I'd rather sit in the dark

23:35.523 --> 23:36.622
if it means my son having a father.

23:36.658 --> 23:38.658
Hey, I am a great dad.

23:38.693 --> 23:41.494
Yeah, sure you are, when
it comes to the fun stuff.

23:41.529 --> 23:43.462
When it comes to the
work, you disappear.

23:43.498 --> 23:45.531
- Because you won't let me do anything!
- Because you do it wrong!

23:45.566 --> 23:47.566
Which is why I stopped
asking in the first place!

23:47.602 --> 23:50.436
And... and why do I even
have to ask permission

23:50.471 --> 23:51.504
to hang out with my own son?

23:51.539 --> 23:53.406
Because he needs consistency.

23:54.575 --> 23:56.442
If I hear that word one more time...

23:56.477 --> 23:57.510
My god!

23:58.579 --> 24:00.346
Lily, you're a momzilla.

24:00.381 --> 24:01.447
You know that, right?

24:01.482 --> 24:02.448
Excuse me?

24:02.483 --> 24:03.482
Everyone sees it!

24:03.518 --> 24:05.551
Stomping over anyone
who gets in your way?

24:05.586 --> 24:08.454
Crash, crash, watch
out, here comes momzilla!

24:10.391 --> 24:11.357
(knocking)

24:11.392 --> 24:14.327
Hey, you two, we're ready to start!

24:14.362 --> 24:15.394
Lily, we have your parents all set up.

24:15.430 --> 24:16.495
Great. We'll be right there.

24:23.404 --> 24:25.371
Maybe we should postpone
this a day or two.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.375
Everyone's put a lot of time
into getting everything ready.

24:29.410 --> 24:31.377
Carlton's awake and my
mum and dad are waiting.

24:31.412 --> 24:32.411
So, what?

24:32.447 --> 24:34.480
So, we're not canceling.

24:34.515 --> 24:35.748
I'll see you out there.

24:37.785 --> 24:40.353
(door opens, closes)

24:53.720 --> 24:54.540
Whoa, calm down.

24:57.612 --> 24:58.304
What'd he say?

24:59.740 --> 25:00.606
Nothing. Forget it.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.679
You're accusing me

25:06.714 --> 25:09.582
of being into Tank when
you and I were dating?

25:09.617 --> 25:10.716
- Seriously?
- Okay, listen,

25:10.752 --> 25:11.684
I know this is strange,

25:11.719 --> 25:13.619
but you two went through a lot together.

25:13.654 --> 25:15.689
You had a really nice thing.
Don't crap on it all now.

25:17.394 --> 25:18.624
Can we try to be mature about this?

25:18.659 --> 25:20.559
Tank: This really has
nothing to do with you.

25:20.595 --> 25:21.694
I understand why Bay is mad,

25:21.729 --> 25:23.629
but you have no right.

25:23.664 --> 25:24.697
You are a complete hypocrite.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.565
You didn't consult me

25:26.601 --> 25:28.601
when you started dating my friend.

25:28.636 --> 25:31.537
You don't get to tell me who I can date.

25:39.547 --> 25:40.513
What did he say?

25:45.653 --> 25:47.620
Look, we knew this was coming.

25:50.525 --> 25:53.459
It's a thousand times worse
than I thought it would be.

25:54.695 --> 25:56.629
May we have the rings please?

25:56.664 --> 25:58.431
<i>(classical music playing)</i>

26:12.513 --> 26:14.580
Toby and Lily have asked

26:14.615 --> 26:16.515
to say a few words in lieu of vows.

26:18.453 --> 26:19.452
(shutter clicks)

26:20.521 --> 26:21.487
Lily...

26:23.558 --> 26:27.426
playing my music way
too loud one night...

26:28.496 --> 26:32.298
turned out to be the
best decision of my life

26:32.333 --> 26:34.300
because it led to you

26:34.335 --> 26:37.369
storming in and demanding...

26:39.407 --> 26:40.372
rightfully...

26:41.409 --> 26:42.775
that I turn it down.

26:44.345 --> 26:46.745
So much has happened since then,

26:46.781 --> 26:50.716
including creating a family together.

26:50.751 --> 26:54.420
We've already been through
a lifetime of experiences,

26:54.455 --> 26:56.422
and I can't wait

26:56.457 --> 26:59.291
to go through the rest
of my life with you.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.359
Really?

27:00.394 --> 27:02.628
Even though I'm a raging momzilla

27:02.663 --> 27:03.696
that stomps over everyone?

27:06.334 --> 27:07.700
- Lily.
- Well, is it a secret?

27:07.735 --> 27:10.336
'Cause according to you,
the whole world sees it.

27:10.371 --> 27:12.338
- Maybe we should talk about this in private.
- No, it's fine.

27:12.373 --> 27:13.706
Actually, can we speed
this up a little bit?

27:13.741 --> 27:15.608
Can we just skip to the "I do's"?

27:15.643 --> 27:16.609
Yep, sure.

27:16.644 --> 27:17.710
Um... uh...

27:17.745 --> 27:19.712
- Toby, do you take...
- He does.

27:19.747 --> 27:21.647
I do.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.616
- Lily, do you take...
- I do.

27:23.651 --> 27:24.650
Okay.

27:24.685 --> 27:28.587
Um, well, then by the power vested in me

27:28.623 --> 27:31.724
by the state of Kansas
and GetOrdainedNow.com,

27:31.759 --> 27:34.627
I pronounce you husband and wife.

27:36.564 --> 27:37.696
You may kiss the bride?

27:54.075 --> 27:55.040
Hi.

27:57.078 --> 27:59.144
Well, we wanted to go non-traditional.

28:00.181 --> 28:01.980
Think we succeeded.

28:04.085 --> 28:06.085
I am controlling.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.986
I nag you all the time

28:08.055 --> 28:09.154
and I don't let you do enough with him.

28:09.190 --> 28:10.222
No.

28:10.257 --> 28:13.125
- You are doing an amazing job.
- The truth is...

28:13.160 --> 28:15.027
I'm jealous.

28:15.062 --> 28:18.063
You get to go to work,
go on all these adventures

28:18.099 --> 28:20.032
and meet all these
people, then you come home,

28:20.067 --> 28:22.000
you play with him for an
hour, and then you go to bed.

28:22.036 --> 28:23.135
You're right.

28:23.170 --> 28:26.004
You do all this gut work,
I mean, day in and day out.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.073
- Bottles, the diapers, the meals...
- No, it's not just that.

28:28.109 --> 28:30.142
It's just... it's just frustrating

28:30.177 --> 28:32.978
trying to teach him to
do the simplest of things,

28:33.013 --> 28:33.979
and he can't get it.

28:34.014 --> 28:35.013
I know.

28:35.049 --> 28:37.116
Most days I wouldn't
change a molecule of him.

28:37.151 --> 28:39.051
Yeah, but sometimes you
just want him to get it

28:39.086 --> 28:41.120
just... a bit quicker.

28:42.189 --> 28:43.122
I know.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.926
I love him so much.

28:48.996 --> 28:51.063
I adore him. He's my everything.

28:51.098 --> 28:52.064
He's part of me.

28:55.136 --> 28:57.002
But...

28:57.037 --> 28:58.904
I don't know if I've got

28:58.939 --> 29:01.006
what it takes to be
a stay-at-home mom.

29:01.041 --> 29:02.107
Oh.

29:02.143 --> 29:04.076
Okay, hey, let's talk about that.

29:04.111 --> 29:06.044
Does that make me a terrible mother?

29:06.080 --> 29:07.913
Of course not.

29:07.948 --> 29:10.048
No dad would ever wonder
that about himself.

29:12.019 --> 29:13.886
I know I made you move to London

29:13.921 --> 29:14.987
and now you're living your dream,

29:15.022 --> 29:16.088
and... and earning all this money,

29:16.123 --> 29:18.857
which I am so grateful for...

29:19.994 --> 29:20.926
What?

29:26.066 --> 29:29.902
So you remember how I
told you about that, uh...

29:29.937 --> 29:31.937
little gambling problem
I had in high school?

29:33.941 --> 29:34.973
Oh, Toby...

29:35.009 --> 29:36.842
You know how it is in London.

29:36.877 --> 29:39.011
You... you bet on what the
weather is gonna be like,

29:39.046 --> 29:41.046
what color tie the Prime
Minister's gonna wear...

29:42.983 --> 29:43.982
How much have you lost?

29:47.922 --> 29:50.856
It's, uh, why I've been working so much.

29:50.891 --> 29:51.990
Trying to make it all back.

29:53.894 --> 29:55.961
It started off as
just a few little bets,

29:55.996 --> 29:57.362
you know, to blow off some steam.

29:57.398 --> 29:58.964
What do you mean?

30:01.368 --> 30:04.336
I... I don't spend nearly as much time

30:04.371 --> 30:08.006
with Carlton as you, so I
have no reason to complain.

30:09.343 --> 30:10.976
But...

30:11.011 --> 30:14.346
you know, I'm always worried about...

30:14.381 --> 30:18.917
whether or not his heart
is gonna be okay, or...

30:18.953 --> 30:20.953
you know, if he's gonna get bullied

30:20.988 --> 30:23.255
on the playground when he's ten...

30:24.959 --> 30:26.992
or who's gonna take care
of him when we're gone.

30:31.365 --> 30:33.899
Yeah, well, I worry about
all those things too.

30:42.276 --> 30:43.375
We're gonna get you some help.

30:44.979 --> 30:45.944
Yeah.

30:52.987 --> 30:55.220
Thanks for not yelling at me.

30:56.357 --> 30:58.857
No, I only yell in the
middle of wedding ceremonies

30:58.893 --> 31:00.325
with our entire family watching.

31:02.263 --> 31:04.162
(both chuckle)

31:08.369 --> 31:09.868
Can I kiss my bride now?

31:24.218 --> 31:25.884
That was an interesting wedding.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.153
Mm, definitely one for the books.

31:29.290 --> 31:30.322
And John wasn't kidding.

31:30.357 --> 31:32.190
These are the best ribs I've ever had.

31:32.226 --> 31:33.325
Don't let him hear you say that.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.193
(chuckles)

31:36.330 --> 31:39.164
So you and Daphne seem
to have a lot in common.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.334
Wait...

31:42.369 --> 31:44.102
are you jealous?

31:45.172 --> 31:46.271
Of course not.

31:46.307 --> 31:48.340
Just wondering what you
guys were talking about.

31:48.375 --> 31:51.109
Mostly she was telling
me what happened in China.

31:51.145 --> 31:53.211
Sounds like she saw some
pretty rough stuff over there.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.113
You mean at the clinic?

31:55.149 --> 31:57.282
I mean having her sister
almost die in front of her.

31:57.318 --> 31:59.051
What?

32:00.220 --> 32:02.254
H... honestly, it...
it wasn't that serious!

32:02.289 --> 32:05.057
It was like a glorified flu.

32:05.092 --> 32:08.060
Japanese encephalitis
sounds very serious.

32:08.095 --> 32:09.227
Why didn't you tell us?

32:09.299 --> 32:11.265
We knew that you would freak out

32:11.301 --> 32:13.101
and make us come home!

32:13.136 --> 32:14.202
Yeah, you got that right.

32:14.237 --> 32:16.204
I would've had you on the
first flight out of Beijing.

32:16.239 --> 32:18.072
It's over now.

32:18.108 --> 32:19.207
We've put it behind us.

32:23.279 --> 32:25.246
Honey, what's wrong?

32:27.283 --> 32:29.250
You were feeling sick that morning.

32:31.321 --> 32:33.254
You told me that you didn't want to go,

32:33.289 --> 32:36.124
but I pushed you to do the hike

32:36.159 --> 32:39.127
because I was sure you'd
love it once we got started.

32:39.162 --> 32:41.262
But I didn't listen to you.

32:41.297 --> 32:44.132
That's a doctor's job,
to listen to her patients,

32:44.167 --> 32:46.134
and I didn't do it.

32:46.169 --> 32:47.168
Daphne, it's okay.

32:47.203 --> 32:48.202
No, it's not.

32:48.238 --> 32:51.105
I thought you were gonna die that night.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.109
And all I could think about was...

32:55.145 --> 32:58.079
calling everyone to
tell them what happened

32:58.114 --> 33:01.983
and how it was all my fault.

33:02.018 --> 33:03.317
(sobs)

33:03.353 --> 33:04.875
- Oh, honey...
- No. Guys, guys, guys, just let...

33:04.876 --> 33:05.822
let me talk to her.

33:13.997 --> 33:17.999
Ling said that you carried me

33:18.034 --> 33:19.100
for, like, three miles...

33:20.270 --> 33:24.939
which pretty much means I
have Supergirl for a sister.

33:27.143 --> 33:28.943
I never thought about

33:28.978 --> 33:31.079
how hard it must have been for you.

33:32.148 --> 33:35.083
I think what happened
with Iris kind of...

33:36.152 --> 33:38.019
brought it all back up, you know?

33:39.089 --> 33:40.922
Daphne, I'm really sorry.

33:42.092 --> 33:44.058
So, uh, how'd it go with Mary Beth?

33:45.128 --> 33:47.128
You are not gonna believe this.

33:47.163 --> 33:48.396
Tank.

33:48.431 --> 33:49.997
How did you know?

33:55.038 --> 33:56.337
What are you doing here?

33:56.372 --> 33:58.906
Bay, you know I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have a good reason.

33:58.942 --> 34:00.041
You're trespassing. I'll call the cops.

34:00.076 --> 34:01.976
Hey, Supergirl,

34:02.011 --> 34:05.046
thank you, but I can handle this.

34:05.081 --> 34:06.881
Okay, but I'm not leaving.

34:06.916 --> 34:08.014
What is it?

34:08.051 --> 34:10.885
There's something you
don't know about Mary Beth.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.018
She came into my
restaurant and we just...

34:12.054 --> 34:15.322
I already heard all of that.

34:15.358 --> 34:17.925
She took pity on you
because you needed a friend.

34:17.960 --> 34:18.993
Yeah, I did.

34:19.027 --> 34:20.360
But so did she.

34:20.396 --> 34:22.362
- Because of Travis?
- No.

34:22.398 --> 34:23.965
Her mom's not doing so good.

34:25.034 --> 34:26.367
She's had a really rough year.

34:28.338 --> 34:29.370
Okay.

34:31.940 --> 34:32.907
Thank you for telling me.

34:36.346 --> 34:39.380
I know Mary Beth told you,
but I had to tell you myself.

34:39.415 --> 34:41.282
None of this was planned.

34:41.317 --> 34:42.949
Okay? It just happened.

34:45.989 --> 34:47.955
The last thing I'd ever
want to do is hurt you...

34:49.391 --> 34:51.391
more than I already have.

35:02.806 --> 35:05.225
I should have told you about China.

35:05.471 --> 35:10.307
Oh, I'm just glad you
finally got it out.

35:10.342 --> 35:13.277
Well, I have Luca to thank for that.

35:16.048 --> 35:17.414
Okay, here it goes.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.018
Luca and I are together.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.420
What do you mean?

35:26.492 --> 35:28.292
Oh, wow.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.359
I should have told you earlier,

35:29.395 --> 35:31.295
but my last relationship
was such a mess,

35:31.330 --> 35:32.996
that I wanted to make
sure that it was something

35:33.032 --> 35:35.299
before I said anything, and now it is,

35:35.334 --> 35:37.334
and I told you as soon as I realized,

35:37.369 --> 35:39.002
and I'm gonna tell Bay
as soon as I see her.

35:39.038 --> 35:41.338
Mom, he's a good guy

35:41.373 --> 35:43.407
who just got me through something big,

35:43.442 --> 35:47.344
and if you're happy, then I'm happy,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.212
and I'm sure Bay will be too.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.481
Wow.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.450
Everybody is handling this

35:53.485 --> 35:55.285
much better than I thought they would.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.386
(chuckles)

35:56.422 --> 35:58.221
Wait...

35:58.257 --> 36:00.324
he doesn't have a
crazy ex-wife, does he?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.225
(laughs)

36:02.261 --> 36:04.194
No, he does not!

36:04.229 --> 36:05.195
(both laugh)

36:06.332 --> 36:08.265
Mary Beth: I blew off my mom that night.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.366
I was supposed to have dinner,

36:09.401 --> 36:11.301
but I just didn't feel like going out...

36:13.372 --> 36:15.238
and then I got the
call from the hospital.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.141
"Your mother's had a stroke."

36:19.311 --> 36:20.277
Oh, no.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.413
A neighbor found her.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.248
Thank God.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.219
But it should have been me.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.355
I should have been there.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.257
- Can't blame yourself.
- But I can.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.326
You know, if I hadn't been so selfish,

36:36.362 --> 36:39.162
if I had just gone over...

36:39.198 --> 36:41.164
I would have been
there when it happened.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.135
I would have gotten her
to the hospital sooner.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.137
How is she doing now?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.140
She's working her way back.

36:51.343 --> 36:54.211
But we finally got her
out of the wheelchair

36:54.246 --> 36:56.113
for a little bit last week.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.181
I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.

37:00.119 --> 37:01.184
You were in China.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.224
With your ex-boyfriend.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.195
I was so...

37:12.231 --> 37:14.097
wrapped up in my own guilt

37:14.133 --> 37:16.199
that I wasn't really talking to anyone

37:16.235 --> 37:18.101
until I ran into Tank.

37:19.171 --> 37:21.204
He knows what it's like

37:21.240 --> 37:24.207
to obsessively wish you could go back

37:24.243 --> 37:26.076
and change one night of your life.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.279
He helped me through it.

37:31.150 --> 37:33.150
He's a good friend.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.317
I remember.

37:34.353 --> 37:38.255
By the time it started
turning into something else...

37:41.160 --> 37:43.193
he wasn't that guy anymore.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.228
I thought you were mad
about me and Travis.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.264
When I first ran into you, I was.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.232
Until I got your email,

37:49.268 --> 37:51.101
I still thought there was a chance

37:51.136 --> 37:52.235
he and I could get
back together someday.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.038
Honestly...

37:56.175 --> 37:58.141
I'm in a good relationship.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.146
So, I'm dating Travis...

38:04.216 --> 38:06.049
and you're with Tank.

38:07.186 --> 38:08.218
What does that mean for us?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.254
I don't know.

38:15.194 --> 38:16.193
Me neither.

38:18.097 --> 38:19.229
John: But don't tell her I told you.

38:19.264 --> 38:22.065
You gotta act like it's a surprise.

38:22.101 --> 38:23.066
It's unreal!

38:23.102 --> 38:25.102
- What is he, like, 25?
- Uh-oh...

38:25.137 --> 38:27.304
do I gotta worry you're gonna
trade me in for a new model?

38:27.339 --> 38:29.272
I'm pretty happy with the old one.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.273
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.274
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.076
Hey.

38:33.112 --> 38:34.211
Uh, can we talk to
you guys for a second?

38:34.246 --> 38:35.245
Sure. What's up?

38:35.280 --> 38:38.115
I'm sorry about making
a scene at the wedding.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.316
Oh, that's okay.

38:39.351 --> 38:42.085
It's been a stressful
year for both of you.

38:42.121 --> 38:44.087
You have a baby with special needs

38:44.123 --> 38:46.056
and you moved to another country.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.224
That's a lot for anyone to handle.

38:47.259 --> 38:50.060
Yeah, we've been
thinking the same thing,

38:50.095 --> 38:53.263
um, which is why we wanted to ask

38:53.298 --> 38:55.198
how you guys felt about us staying

38:55.234 --> 38:58.101
in the guest room a
little longer than a week.

38:59.238 --> 39:00.203
You're staying?

39:00.239 --> 39:03.106
We called Melody to see if my old job

39:03.142 --> 39:04.207
at the deaf program was still available,

39:04.243 --> 39:06.176
and turns out it is.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.178
Toby: I'm gonna cut back on DJing

39:08.213 --> 39:12.082
and we're gonna take
care of Carlton together.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.116
So, you're coming home!

39:13.152 --> 39:14.251
Kathryn: And I want you to know

39:14.286 --> 39:17.053
we'll be here for you all the way.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.188
(Carlton crying)

39:18.223 --> 39:21.091
Oh, I'll get him.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.226
I mean, if that's okay with you.

39:23.262 --> 39:25.162
Actually, that would be brilliant.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.197
Hey, you know what? I
think I'll come with.

39:27.266 --> 39:29.065
Work on my diaper skills.

39:29.101 --> 39:30.233
(all laugh)

39:30.269 --> 39:31.234
Lily: Thanks.

39:32.271 --> 39:34.104
- John: Here you go.
- Thanks.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.105
You bet.

39:37.109 --> 39:38.274
- Well...
- (chuckles)

39:38.318 --> 39:39.217
<i>L'chaim.</i>

39:42.056 --> 39:44.189
She was in so much pain

39:44.224 --> 39:48.093
and I wasn't there for her.

39:51.732 --> 39:55.200
So much happened while we were in China.

39:55.235 --> 39:57.169
To Mary Beth, to Emmett.

39:59.273 --> 40:03.175
I'm just saying maybe
we stayed too long.

40:09.183 --> 40:11.283
Thanks, but, uh...

40:11.318 --> 40:13.151
I... I have to work.

40:13.187 --> 40:17.089
Yeah. N... Noelle, uh, has this,

40:17.124 --> 40:19.124
uh, bachelor party coming in

40:19.159 --> 40:23.028
and, uh, she needs all hands on deck.

40:28.235 --> 40:29.134
I won't.
