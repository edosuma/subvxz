00:13.026 --> 00:15.794
Wow, Joffrey sure is
getting big.

00:15.862 --> 00:17.128
Big or fat?

00:17.196 --> 00:18.829
I say fat, but Michael says big.

00:18.896 --> 00:20.329
Either way, it's a problem.

00:20.397 --> 00:21.831
Michael?
Oh, I've been seeing a guy

00:21.899 --> 00:23.765
from yoga class
for the past couple weeks.

00:23.832 --> 00:25.133
We're actually going out
again tonight.

00:25.201 --> 00:27.101
It's nothing serious yet.

00:27.169 --> 00:30.505
He's a smart, handsome doctor.
He's great with kids.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.341
Child molesters
are great with kids.

00:32.409 --> 00:34.779
What are you saying, Ryan?
Do you want me to stop dating?

00:34.847 --> 00:36.214
No, of course not.

00:36.281 --> 00:37.949
Look at that.

00:38.017 --> 00:39.750
I'm surprised the little fat-ass
missed a morsel.

00:39.818 --> 00:42.052
So do you want me to
call you a cab or...?

00:42.120 --> 00:43.153
Breakfast?

00:43.220 --> 00:46.589
Uh, yeah, I've kind of got

00:46.656 --> 00:48.658
a bunch of errands
to run today, so...

00:48.726 --> 00:50.362
Ah, shit, my homeboy
just saw me.

00:50.429 --> 00:52.330
I better go say hi.

00:52.398 --> 00:54.199
KRISTEN: Where the hell did
I put those baby wipes?

00:54.266 --> 00:55.366
WILFRED:
Hey!

00:55.434 --> 00:56.567
J-Murda!

00:56.635 --> 00:58.136
What's up, little man?

00:58.203 --> 00:59.471
Still shitting whenever?

00:59.538 --> 01:01.407
Nice!

01:01.474 --> 01:02.775
Is she gone yet?

01:04.411 --> 01:06.545
Oh, geez.

01:06.613 --> 01:10.083
Hey, sorry about that.

01:10.150 --> 01:12.085
KRISTEN: I've been thinking
a lot about who should be

01:12.153 --> 01:14.721
Joffrey's legal guardian,
and I'm leaning towards Dad.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.990
Dad?
Yeah, Ryan, despite what you think,

01:17.058 --> 01:18.425
Dad is not that bad.

01:18.493 --> 01:19.659
He has been generously
supporting me

01:19.727 --> 01:21.428
while I look for a new job.

01:21.496 --> 01:23.431
He's... he's just a great
role model for Joffrey.

01:23.498 --> 01:26.467
He's successful,
he's reliable, he's thin.

01:26.535 --> 01:28.837
He's also controlling
and manipulative.

01:28.904 --> 01:30.973
Why not me?

01:31.040 --> 01:33.208
Honestly, I'm the only guy
in your life

01:33.276 --> 01:34.556
who's really looking out
for you.

01:34.578 --> 01:36.045
You actually want this?

01:36.113 --> 01:39.149
Of course. I love Joffrey.

01:39.217 --> 01:42.219
Okay, well, I guess I'll keep
thinking about it, then.

01:42.287 --> 01:44.555
But so you know,
it's a huge responsibility.

01:44.623 --> 01:46.457
Can you honestly look me
in the eye

01:46.525 --> 01:48.165
and tell me
you've got your shit together?

01:52.731 --> 01:54.599
I'm good. I swear.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.569
Ryan, check out this
Internet site I found.

01:57.637 --> 01:59.505
It's for people who just want

01:59.572 --> 02:02.241
to have raunchy, demented sex,
no strings attached.

02:02.309 --> 02:04.811
"Stuffed-Animal-Store.com"?

02:04.878 --> 02:06.612
WILFRED: Look at the expression
on that slut's face.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.448
I bet she gives insane trunk.

02:08.514 --> 02:10.416
Ah, dude,

02:10.484 --> 02:11.951
check the horn on that freak.

02:12.019 --> 02:13.620
Wouldn't mind sitting on that.

02:13.688 --> 02:15.322
What's going on with you today?

02:15.390 --> 02:17.458
I thought you and Bear
were married.

02:17.525 --> 02:20.595
We were, but married life's
not really for me.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.197
I'm like a tumbleweed,
a rolling stone.

02:23.265 --> 02:26.000
Or a freight train
that can't stay on the tracks,

02:26.068 --> 02:28.103
and it's, like,
going off a cliff

02:28.171 --> 02:30.105
with, like,
250 passengers on board,

02:30.173 --> 02:31.807
and a lot of them
die on impact,

02:31.874 --> 02:34.109
but there's like,
ten that survive,

02:34.177 --> 02:35.878
and they're trapped.

02:35.946 --> 02:39.181
And there's this one guy,
he's so in shock,

02:39.249 --> 02:42.885
he's laughing maniacally,
and the flames are closing in,

02:42.953 --> 02:46.423
and everyone's, like, sobbing
and holding each other,

02:46.491 --> 02:47.924
but it's the laughter

02:47.992 --> 02:51.428
that's the most
disturbing thing of all.

02:51.496 --> 02:55.599
And there's this one lady...

02:55.667 --> 02:58.702
and her eye
is just, like... out.

03:01.072 --> 03:03.640
The point is, I'm single again.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.810
Want to come out tonight
and get some strange?

03:05.877 --> 03:07.645
I'm not really in the mood.

03:07.713 --> 03:09.080
You never are.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.581
I should've called Joffrey.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.350
I mean, that guy's my <i>dawg!</i>

03:12.418 --> 03:14.319
I mean, you go out
with him, you just know

03:14.386 --> 03:16.454
he's leaving the club with two
tiny little handfuls of ass.

03:16.522 --> 03:18.356
I'm just worried about Kristen.

03:18.424 --> 03:20.225
Ever since she became a mom,

03:20.293 --> 03:22.527
she's been making
some questionable choices,

03:22.595 --> 03:25.764
like letting a guy she barely
knows hang around her baby,

03:25.831 --> 03:28.633
choosing my dad to be
the legal guardian.

03:28.701 --> 03:31.904
I think I need to be more
involved in her life.

03:31.972 --> 03:34.440
You and your sister have
a messed up relationship.

03:34.508 --> 03:38.011
It's like you get off
on sabotaging each other's lives

03:38.078 --> 03:40.947
and then miraculously being
there to pick up the pieces.

03:41.015 --> 03:42.916
Come on.
I would never stand in the way

03:42.984 --> 03:44.184
of my sister's happiness.

03:44.252 --> 03:46.086
Even if it means she won't need

03:46.154 --> 03:47.874
little brother's shoulder
to cry on anymore?

03:47.888 --> 03:49.589
God, why am I listening
to sibling advice

03:49.657 --> 03:51.357
from a guy who ate his
own sister's ears?

03:51.425 --> 03:53.727
Ear.

03:56.263 --> 03:58.298
Ryan, have you seen

03:58.366 --> 04:00.967
my <i>We Bought a Zoo</i>
Criterion Collection?

04:01.035 --> 04:02.902
What do you mean,
suck your dick?

04:02.970 --> 04:04.438
Bear?

04:04.506 --> 04:07.307
Was that you just talking?

04:07.375 --> 04:09.843
Okay, first of all, holy shit,

04:09.911 --> 04:12.012
that was a spot-on
Ryan impression.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.582
Second, what the hell
are you doing here?

04:14.650 --> 04:15.917
It's over between us.

04:15.984 --> 04:17.185
(knocking)

04:17.252 --> 04:18.587
Must be the pizza.

04:19.889 --> 04:21.123
Kristen.
Where have you been?

04:21.190 --> 04:22.658
I tried calling you,
like, six times!

04:22.726 --> 04:24.293
My babysitter canceled
at the last second,

04:24.361 --> 04:26.629
so I really need you
to help me out, okay?

04:26.697 --> 04:28.798
You know, since you're
the only guy in my life

04:28.866 --> 04:30.266
who's really
looking out for me?

04:30.334 --> 04:32.168
Plus, you know,
it'll give you a chance

04:32.236 --> 04:34.537
to see what it'd be like
to be his guardian.

04:34.605 --> 04:35.938
Of course, yeah.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.107
WILFRED:
Yeah... boy!

04:38.175 --> 04:40.310
Joffrey's in the house!

04:40.378 --> 04:43.280
J-Money, what's popping?!

04:43.348 --> 04:44.615
(knocking)

04:44.683 --> 04:45.850
KRISTEN:
Oh, that's Michael.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.484
You wanted to meet him, right?

04:47.552 --> 04:48.752
(Joffrey fussing)

04:48.820 --> 04:50.120
Yeah, I know.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.625
Hey.
Michael, this is my brother, Ryan.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.527
Oh, hey, Ryan. Michael.
Hey.

04:56.595 --> 04:57.995
Did you have trouble
finding the house?

04:58.063 --> 04:59.830
No, I got a GPS thing
in my car.

04:59.898 --> 05:01.465
Couldn't wait two minutes, right?
(Joffrey crying)

05:01.532 --> 05:02.732
I-I've got him.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.135
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

05:05.202 --> 05:06.436
Uncle Ryan's here.

05:06.504 --> 05:07.737
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

05:07.805 --> 05:09.072
It'll be fine.

05:09.139 --> 05:11.240
(high-pitched):
Hi there, Joffrey!

05:11.308 --> 05:12.876
I'm Mr. Bear.

05:12.944 --> 05:14.744
Would you like to be my friend?

05:14.812 --> 05:16.713
I'd like to be your friend.

05:16.781 --> 05:18.215
(makes kissing sound)

05:18.283 --> 05:19.750
Seems like you're not
the only one

05:19.818 --> 05:21.419
who can do spot-on
impressions, eh, Bear?

05:21.453 --> 05:23.687
Told you he was good.
Okay, I'm just gonna go

05:23.755 --> 05:24.788
to the bathroom,
and then we'll leave.

05:24.856 --> 05:26.056
Okay.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.728
So...

05:32.796 --> 05:35.597
where are you planning
on taking my sister tonight?

05:35.665 --> 05:37.199
Oh, there's this, uh,
little Italian restaurant

05:37.267 --> 05:38.400
I've been wanting to try.
Gennaro's?

05:38.467 --> 05:40.568
Oh, cool, cool.

05:42.438 --> 05:44.038
Is that your Honda out there?

05:44.106 --> 05:45.572
Yeah.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.674
Huh.
Not exactly the kind of car

05:47.742 --> 05:49.642
you'd expect a doctor to drive.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.277
I'm not really a car guy, so...

05:51.345 --> 05:52.578
(phone rings)
Oh.

05:55.782 --> 05:58.650
Sorry, I've got to take this
outside, if you don't mind.

05:58.718 --> 06:00.985
WILFRED: So, Joffs, I
was thinking tonight

06:01.052 --> 06:02.586
the two of us can go out

06:02.654 --> 06:04.254
and maybe try heroin
for the first time.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.189
(Joffrey cooing)
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:06.256 --> 06:08.190
I didn't realize
you two were talking.

06:08.258 --> 06:10.559
No, I think it's great
that you two are talking.

06:10.627 --> 06:12.061
You're a great listener,
and, uh...

06:12.129 --> 06:13.762
and Bear could use
a friend right now.

06:13.830 --> 06:15.897
So three cold ones, then, yeah?

06:21.403 --> 06:23.771
Where's Michael?
Outside on the phone.

06:23.838 --> 06:25.706
Well, what do you think?

06:25.773 --> 06:28.107
He seems great.
Right?

06:28.175 --> 06:29.642
And just so you know,
if tonight goes

06:29.710 --> 06:31.410
how I expect it to,
there will be plenty

06:31.478 --> 06:32.578
of opportunities
for you to babysit.

06:32.646 --> 06:33.513
(chuckling):
Okay.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.248
Like, a lot.

06:35.316 --> 06:37.550
Like, overnight.
Oh. Oh, I get it.

06:37.618 --> 06:39.252
Okay. Well, call me
if you need anything.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.820
Okay.
I won't need a thing.

06:40.888 --> 06:42.289
Oh, uh, Kristen?

06:42.356 --> 06:44.124
Thanks for trusting
me with Joffrey.

06:44.192 --> 06:46.326
It'll be nice to spend
some alone time with him.

06:48.463 --> 06:49.730
Good night.

06:51.499 --> 06:53.400
What the hell?

06:53.468 --> 06:54.901
Ah.

06:54.969 --> 06:58.005
No, I get it.

06:58.072 --> 07:00.340
We're divorced now,
so you're fair game.

07:00.408 --> 07:01.742
I'm cool with that.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.978
You two have fun.

07:08.616 --> 07:10.484
(Joffrey crying)

07:12.543 --> 07:15.279
Look at them. Flaunting it
in front of my face.

07:15.346 --> 07:17.281
Yeah, I hope you
used protection.

07:17.349 --> 07:20.217
I wouldn't like for you
to catch Bear's semen ants.

07:20.285 --> 07:22.185
Semen ants?

07:22.253 --> 07:24.521
That's the technical name
for the colony of ants

07:24.589 --> 07:26.023
living inside Bear
that sustains itself

07:26.091 --> 07:28.025
from the nutrients
obtained from my semen.

07:28.092 --> 07:30.727
Okay, I'm ending this line
of conversation right now.

07:30.795 --> 07:32.629
Oh. Well, see, that's the
thing about semen ants.

07:32.697 --> 07:34.331
No one wants to talk about it.

07:34.399 --> 07:36.266
So how do we ever educate
anyone about this epidemic?

07:36.334 --> 07:38.101
You know, Obama has semen ants.

07:38.169 --> 07:39.849
He rarely talks about it,
but he's got 'em.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.974
(Joffrey coos)

07:44.042 --> 07:45.576
Are you gonna try
and Google it?

07:45.643 --> 07:47.544
Yeah, you won't find it
on the normal Internet,

07:47.612 --> 07:49.179
but it's all over the deep Web.

07:49.247 --> 07:50.780
I'm not looking up
Obama's semen ants.

07:50.848 --> 07:52.148
I'm checking Facebook

07:52.216 --> 07:54.484
to see if Kristen
is friends with Michael.

07:54.551 --> 07:56.185
There was something
off about him.

07:56.253 --> 07:57.787
Good idea.

07:57.854 --> 07:59.889
Find out what you can
so we can expose him.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.791
You know, if it wasn't
for that Michael guy,

08:01.859 --> 08:03.159
Bear wouldn't have
even been introduced

08:03.227 --> 08:04.661
to that backstabbing
Bro Code violator!

08:04.729 --> 08:06.563
(Wilfred chuckles)

08:06.631 --> 08:08.699
What do you mean,
Joffrey makes love to you

08:08.766 --> 08:11.134
the way you deserve
to be made love to,

08:11.202 --> 08:14.705
gently and tenderly, but at the
same time firmly and forceful?

08:14.772 --> 08:16.673
(scoffing laugh):
Oh, really?

08:16.741 --> 08:19.110
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

08:19.178 --> 08:23.414
Okay, on the count of three,
let's both say our penis sizes.

08:23.481 --> 08:24.982
One, two, three...

08:25.050 --> 08:26.650
Tiny!

08:26.718 --> 08:29.053
Wait, did you just say,
"Thick as a brick"?

08:32.991 --> 08:34.825
(whistles appreciatively)

08:34.893 --> 08:37.160
She's not even
Facebook friends with him.

08:37.229 --> 08:38.729
How well could she know him?

08:38.797 --> 08:40.464
I mean, she's Facebook friends

08:40.532 --> 08:41.899
with her high school
krump instructor.

08:41.967 --> 08:43.433
Maybe we're wasting our time.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.738
I mean, maybe Kristen
has found a perfect guy.

08:46.806 --> 08:48.373
He's tall,
good-looking, smart,

08:48.441 --> 08:51.009
has the fresh scent
of a woman's nether regions,

08:51.077 --> 08:52.510
he's got GPS...

08:52.578 --> 08:54.379
Wait-- the scent of what?

08:54.446 --> 08:56.247
A woman's nether regions.

08:56.315 --> 08:58.382
Was the scent Kristen's?

08:58.450 --> 09:00.418
No, no, way less pumpkiny.

09:00.485 --> 09:04.022
And also, it was very fresh,
like no more than an hour old.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.658
Wilfred, that means
he fooled around

09:06.726 --> 09:10.128
with someone before
he picked up my sister.

09:10.195 --> 09:12.197
If we could find...

09:14.233 --> 09:15.901
You're making this up,
aren't you?

09:15.968 --> 09:17.635
And why would I do that?

09:17.703 --> 09:19.383
Because, if she breaks it off
with Michael,

09:19.438 --> 09:20.839
then she won't need me
to babysit,

09:20.906 --> 09:22.040
which means
Joffrey won't be around

09:22.107 --> 09:23.741
to steal Bear away from you.

09:23.809 --> 09:25.810
I'm telling you, that guy
reeked of nether regions.

09:25.878 --> 09:28.113
And if there's one thing
I never lie about,

09:28.180 --> 09:29.580
it's guys reeking
of nether regions!

09:31.417 --> 09:33.619
Wilfred, have you seen
the bottle

09:33.687 --> 09:35.588
with Kristen's breast milk?

09:35.656 --> 09:37.456
Ah...

09:37.524 --> 09:39.726
Well, well, well,

09:39.793 --> 09:42.028
without his precious
energy drink,

09:42.096 --> 09:44.497
it looks like baby Joffrey
won't have the strength

09:44.565 --> 09:46.900
to jackhammer Bear
for a whole hour again tonight.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.669
Right in front of me, too. Rude.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.275
Turn down this alley.

09:55.343 --> 09:57.076
There's a shortcut to the CVS.

09:57.144 --> 09:59.212
How do I know what kind
of formula to buy?

09:59.280 --> 10:00.880
Why don't you ask Kristen?

10:00.948 --> 10:02.749
Because I don't
feel like explaining

10:02.817 --> 10:04.851
that the dog drank
her breast milk.

10:04.919 --> 10:06.252
I'm supposed to be proving

10:06.320 --> 10:07.720
that I can be
responsible, remember?

10:07.788 --> 10:08.988
Turn left here.

10:09.056 --> 10:10.557
(tires squeal)

10:10.625 --> 10:13.493
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

10:13.561 --> 10:16.596
Wait-- I don't see a CVS.

10:16.664 --> 10:18.498
There's a liquor store...

10:18.566 --> 10:20.267
Gennaro's?

10:20.334 --> 10:21.635
Wilfred!

10:21.703 --> 10:23.437
What are you doing?!

10:25.306 --> 10:26.707
(hushed):
Wilfred!

10:28.109 --> 10:30.443
Is this Michael's car?

10:30.511 --> 10:31.945
I sure hope so.

10:32.012 --> 10:33.112
Wilfred!

10:35.115 --> 10:37.050
You get out of there!

10:37.118 --> 10:38.885
What if someone sees us?

10:40.822 --> 10:43.056
Hello, Michael McDerry.

10:43.124 --> 10:44.924
You got his name?
Uh-huh.

10:48.228 --> 10:50.729
Uh, check the GPS.
The last address.

10:50.797 --> 10:53.499
I like the way you think, mate.

10:53.566 --> 10:55.200
Hurry!

10:57.537 --> 10:59.237
Another woman's name.

10:59.305 --> 11:00.939
See, I told you
I wasn't bullshitting.

11:01.006 --> 11:03.374
He was with
this non-pumpkiny Gloria chick

11:03.442 --> 11:05.209
just before he came
to pick up Kristen.

11:05.277 --> 11:07.979
All we have to do now
is go to her house and...

11:08.046 --> 11:09.580
Oh, my God.

11:09.648 --> 11:11.949
What?
Is there something else?

11:12.017 --> 11:14.552
His middle name is Paul.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.954
So?

11:16.022 --> 11:17.222
Don't you see what this means?

11:17.289 --> 11:18.189
Paul?

11:18.257 --> 11:20.691
Paul the Ball?

11:20.759 --> 11:23.060
(laughing):
Oh, man.

11:23.128 --> 11:25.162
We are gonna rip
on this guy so bad.

11:25.230 --> 11:26.530
(laughing)

11:26.598 --> 11:27.832
Paul the Ball.

11:27.899 --> 11:28.966
Come on.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.188
"Responsible Insurance"?
This is so weird.

11:39.308 --> 11:40.875
What, is he hooking up
with his insurance agent?

11:40.943 --> 11:42.243
Well, look.

11:42.311 --> 11:43.776
I think we have
all the evidence we need.

11:43.896 --> 11:45.680
I say we go back to Gennaro's,

11:45.747 --> 11:47.415
maybe split an appetizer,

11:47.483 --> 11:50.251
definitely try the cannelloni
with walnuts and fried sage--

11:50.319 --> 11:52.020
it's all anyone's
talking about on Yelp--

11:52.087 --> 11:54.755
then stab Michael's face
three or four dozen times.

11:54.823 --> 11:56.491
But it's not enough
evidence, Wilfred.

11:56.558 --> 11:57.792
Ryan, I'm telling you.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.061
Him, his GPS,
his steering wheel,

12:00.129 --> 12:02.830
all smacking of the fresh scent
of nether regions.

12:02.898 --> 12:04.332
Oh, will you stop
saying "nether regions"?

12:04.399 --> 12:06.467
No one calls it that.
It's weird.

12:06.535 --> 12:08.569
I'm just using
the clinical term.

12:12.641 --> 12:14.643
Is everything okay out here?

12:14.711 --> 12:16.612
Sorry. I was just
looking for someone.

12:16.679 --> 12:18.180
Who were you looking for?

12:19.482 --> 12:21.951
Someone named...
Gloria.

12:24.454 --> 12:26.155
Come inside.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.627
Now...

12:32.695 --> 12:34.095
who am I speaking to?

12:34.163 --> 12:35.363
No real names.

12:35.431 --> 12:36.598
Say Shabazzleford.

12:36.665 --> 12:38.667
Sha... Dave.

12:38.734 --> 12:40.435
Mmm...

12:40.503 --> 12:43.305
Will Gloria be joining us?

12:44.507 --> 12:46.375
I am Gloria.

12:48.611 --> 12:50.879
So, Dave...

12:52.716 --> 12:54.717
...who should we thank
for this referral?

12:54.784 --> 12:57.019
(sniffing)

12:57.087 --> 12:58.187
It's not her, Dave.

12:59.323 --> 13:00.556
(sighs)

13:00.624 --> 13:02.058
I'm sorry.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.961
I-I think I've
made a mistake.

13:05.028 --> 13:06.128
I-I should really leave.

13:06.196 --> 13:07.329
Who told you about us, Dave?

13:09.032 --> 13:10.499
Oh, there's no need
to be nervous.

13:12.869 --> 13:14.904
Michael.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.307
Michael McDerry.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.042
Oh...

13:19.109 --> 13:21.144
Well, why didn't you say so?

13:21.211 --> 13:23.980
Michael's a really good
friend of the agency's.

13:24.048 --> 13:25.081
Come on.
(clicks tongue)

13:25.149 --> 13:26.249
Follow.

13:28.286 --> 13:30.487
♪ ♪

13:32.357 --> 13:33.724
Whoa.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.726
You know what this place is.

13:35.794 --> 13:38.428
The nether regions have got
to be here somewhere.

13:38.496 --> 13:39.863
I'll find them.

13:39.931 --> 13:41.931
(chimes)

13:45.736 --> 13:47.603
By the way, Dave,

13:47.671 --> 13:50.539
I feel like I need
to be candid with you:

13:50.607 --> 13:53.776
We absolutely forbid
the involvement of children.

13:53.843 --> 13:56.011
But I am more than happy

13:56.079 --> 13:57.513
to watch over the baby

13:57.581 --> 13:58.981
while you and your dog

13:59.049 --> 14:00.850
realize your very own
unique, special fantasy.

14:00.851 --> 14:02.351
No...
So you just let me know

14:02.419 --> 14:04.153
when you see something
you like, okay?

14:04.221 --> 14:06.389
(chuckles)

14:09.894 --> 14:11.028
She's here.

14:11.095 --> 14:12.662
Are you sure?
Positive.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.064
Are you chewing gum?

14:14.131 --> 14:16.633
No. Dogs can't
chew gum, Ryan.

14:16.701 --> 14:17.668
(phone ringing)

14:17.735 --> 14:18.969
Shit.

14:19.037 --> 14:21.305
Kristen. How's dinner?

14:21.372 --> 14:22.673
KRISTEN:
Ryan, where the hell are you?

14:22.741 --> 14:25.043
Where is Joffrey?
Is Joffrey okay?

14:25.110 --> 14:27.412
R-Ryan?

14:27.479 --> 14:28.980
Ryan!

14:30.916 --> 14:32.617
Oh... Hey, guys.

14:32.685 --> 14:35.386
Uh, sorry to scare
you like that.

14:35.454 --> 14:37.989
How come you're back so early?

14:38.057 --> 14:39.891
Someone broke
into Michael's car.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.659
Oh...

14:41.727 --> 14:42.994
Oh, God.

14:43.062 --> 14:44.563
You took Joffrey out
without his hat?

14:44.630 --> 14:45.864
He could've gotten pneumonia.

14:45.932 --> 14:47.332
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about it..

14:47.400 --> 14:48.633
I actually did think about it,

14:48.701 --> 14:50.135
but I wanted Joffrey
to catch pneumonia,

14:50.202 --> 14:51.903
'cause, well...
dude's a dick.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.210
That was so
irresponsible, Ryan.

14:53.239 --> 14:54.573
It is pretty cold out there.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.141
Really?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.476
You're the last person

14:57.543 --> 14:59.311
that should be passing
judgment on anyone.

14:59.379 --> 15:00.479
Excuse me?
I know what you've been doing

15:00.547 --> 15:01.647
at Gloria's.

15:01.715 --> 15:03.582
What?
Who's Gloria?

15:03.650 --> 15:06.018
Yeah, Michael, who is Gloria?

15:06.085 --> 15:08.554
She's just, um...
You know what?

15:08.622 --> 15:10.656
I'd rather not talk about her.
Oh, because you don't want

15:10.724 --> 15:12.125
to tell Kristen
about the illegal brothel

15:12.192 --> 15:13.693
that you've been frequenting?

15:13.761 --> 15:15.762
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

15:15.830 --> 15:17.830
but Michael
was with a prostitute

15:17.898 --> 15:19.866
right before he picked you up
for your date tonight.

15:19.934 --> 15:21.267
Ryan, what the hell
are you talking about?

15:21.335 --> 15:22.635
Are you insane?

15:22.703 --> 15:23.570
MICHAEL:
No, it's...

15:23.638 --> 15:25.171
it's true.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.074
But-but it's not what you think.

15:28.142 --> 15:30.243
The prostitute was a patient.

15:30.311 --> 15:31.845
Patient?

15:31.912 --> 15:33.880
Michael's a gynecologist, Ryan.

15:33.948 --> 15:35.382
Yeah, I do pro bono work

15:35.449 --> 15:36.783
for an organization
called Safety First.

15:36.851 --> 15:38.118
Most of the women are illegals.

15:38.186 --> 15:39.620
They're scared, uneducated,

15:39.687 --> 15:41.288
and they don't have access
to health insurance.

15:41.356 --> 15:44.359
So I perform free
blood work, Pap smears.

15:44.426 --> 15:46.628
In fact, earlier tonight,

15:46.695 --> 15:48.129
I had to make
an emergency visit

15:48.197 --> 15:49.677
because one of the women
was suffering

15:49.699 --> 15:51.260
from an infection
of the nether regions.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.569
You know, I have to say,
the fact that

15:53.637 --> 15:55.838
you snooped around
and secretly gathered

15:55.905 --> 15:57.185
all of this information
about me,

15:57.206 --> 15:58.840
it makes me very uncomfortable.

15:58.908 --> 16:00.108
Michael, I hope you
know I had nothing...

16:00.176 --> 16:01.257
I-I think I'd better leave.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.214
Well, Ryan, you were right.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.916
I guess I was letting
a crazy person

16:08.983 --> 16:10.818
hang around Joffrey: you.

16:10.885 --> 16:11.919
No...
You can obviously forget

16:11.986 --> 16:13.520
about the legal guardianship.

16:13.587 --> 16:15.255
Kristen, wait.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.623
Oh, my God.

16:16.690 --> 16:20.293
Are those... ants?

16:20.361 --> 16:23.396
Not just any ants.

16:23.464 --> 16:24.698
KRISTEN: Ugh!
(door closes)

16:30.659 --> 16:33.199
Oh, you love Joffrey now?
Look at his hairline!

16:33.319 --> 16:35.086
It's only gonna get worse.

16:35.154 --> 16:36.888
You tattooed his name

16:36.955 --> 16:38.689
on the inside of
your lower lip?!

16:38.757 --> 16:40.758
Gah!

16:40.826 --> 16:43.828
If I can't have
you, no one will!

16:43.895 --> 16:45.096
(grunts)

16:45.163 --> 16:46.564
Just let it happen.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.432
Into the light.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.367
Shh...

16:52.104 --> 16:53.271
Oh, hey, Ryan. What's up?

16:53.338 --> 16:54.572
"What's up?"

16:54.640 --> 16:56.040
Thanks to your little
love triangle,

16:56.107 --> 16:57.375
my sister isn't speaking to me.

16:57.442 --> 16:59.611
Hey, I'm a victim here, too.

16:59.678 --> 17:01.919
If Bear hadn't messed around
with one of my best friends,

17:01.947 --> 17:02.914
none of this would've happened.

17:02.982 --> 17:05.150
Nobody messed around
with anybody.

17:05.217 --> 17:07.484
Bear is a stuffed animal,
and Joffrey is a baby.

17:07.553 --> 17:10.589
The relationship between Bear
and Joffrey is very real.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.424
And he's not a baby
where it counts!

17:12.492 --> 17:14.894
Okay. You want
to play this game?

17:14.962 --> 17:17.096
You say you want Bear
to meet someone else,

17:17.164 --> 17:18.631
but the second Bear
actually does,

17:18.699 --> 17:20.200
you freak out

17:20.267 --> 17:22.269
and start interfering
and sabotaging.

17:22.336 --> 17:24.369
You talking about me and Bear
or you and Kristen?

17:24.438 --> 17:26.306
What?

17:28.042 --> 17:29.777
(chuckling):
Ryan...

17:29.844 --> 17:31.645
we're a crazy pair.

17:31.713 --> 17:34.014
Sometimes, when you think
you're looking out for...

17:34.082 --> 17:35.249
Jesus!

17:35.317 --> 17:38.352
Why won't you...

17:38.420 --> 17:41.588
die?!

17:45.193 --> 17:46.493
Ryan, aren't you
going to introduce me

17:46.561 --> 17:47.494
to your new friend?

17:47.562 --> 17:49.029
This bear is for Joffrey.

17:49.097 --> 17:50.831
(laughs)

17:50.899 --> 17:52.666
What's up,
Responsible Insurance?

17:52.734 --> 17:54.468
(laughing)
Huh?

17:54.536 --> 17:56.337
Oh, you know, from earlier.

17:56.404 --> 17:58.873
The insurance company we went
to, and then in the back room

17:58.940 --> 18:00.608
they were running
the prostitution ring?

18:00.675 --> 18:02.843
And since you're offering
the new bear to Joffrey,

18:02.911 --> 18:06.113
you're sort of running
your own quasi-prostitution...

18:06.181 --> 18:07.314
Whatever.
You don't get it.

18:07.382 --> 18:09.117
No, I get it.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.954
What are you doing here?

18:13.022 --> 18:15.323
(high-pitched voice):
Hi, Kristen.

18:15.391 --> 18:18.426
Your brother Ryan sent me over
to say he's sorry.

18:19.796 --> 18:21.463
Can we talk?

18:21.531 --> 18:23.451
Only if you promise
never to do that voice again.

18:25.101 --> 18:26.935
Maybe on some level,

18:27.003 --> 18:29.405
I'm worried that if you find
happiness with someone,

18:29.472 --> 18:31.073
you won't need me anymore.

18:31.141 --> 18:32.775
Ryan, you're my brother.

18:32.843 --> 18:35.111
I'll always need you.
And so will Joffrey.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.659
You know, in case
you haven't noticed,

18:36.714 --> 18:38.915
you're not the only one
who needs to feel needed.

18:38.983 --> 18:41.184
I guess we both have some issues
we have to work out.

18:43.688 --> 18:46.757
And then I said, "What's up,
Responsible Insurance?"

18:46.825 --> 18:48.860
(chuckles)
Exactly!

18:48.927 --> 18:50.561
Thank you!

18:50.629 --> 18:52.549
Would it help if I called
Michael and apologized?

18:52.563 --> 18:54.931
Nah, don't bother. I doubt it
would've worked out anyway.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.100
He drives a Honda.
And he's so pale.

18:57.167 --> 18:59.602
Anyway, that's the last time
I let Dad set me up.

18:59.669 --> 19:01.103
Dad?

19:01.171 --> 19:02.504
You said you met him at yoga.

19:02.572 --> 19:04.640
Well, yeah, well, I lied.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.908
I figured you'd freak out
if you knew Dad was involved.

19:06.976 --> 19:08.376
But here is the truth, Ryan:

19:08.444 --> 19:10.178
Dad met a wonderful guy,

19:10.246 --> 19:12.380
and he thought he'd be perfect
for his daughter.

19:12.448 --> 19:14.516
And I know you think Dad's
always up to something,

19:14.584 --> 19:16.718
but it's not true.
He isn't out to get you.

19:16.786 --> 19:17.953
In fact, he was the one

19:18.020 --> 19:19.381
who convinced me
to let you babysit

19:19.389 --> 19:21.189
when he had to cancel
at the last minute.

19:21.257 --> 19:23.625
Dad was the original
babysitter?

19:23.693 --> 19:24.993
Yeah. Why?

19:36.307 --> 19:38.274
MAN:
Well, this is a surprise.

19:38.342 --> 19:39.843
Let me be clear:

19:39.910 --> 19:42.011
I'm not calling to say hello
or to catch up.

19:42.079 --> 19:43.647
I just have one thing to say.

19:43.714 --> 19:45.382
All right, well...

19:45.450 --> 19:47.490
This is a strange way
to open our first conversation

19:47.552 --> 19:49.686
in over a year, Ryan,
but go ahead.

19:49.754 --> 19:50.954
I know what you did.

19:51.022 --> 19:52.189
Okay.

19:52.256 --> 19:53.456
What did I do?

19:53.524 --> 19:55.492
Setting Kristen up with Michael,

19:55.560 --> 19:57.193
offering to babysit,

19:57.261 --> 19:58.962
canceling at the last minute

19:59.030 --> 20:00.898
and advising her to call me.

20:00.965 --> 20:03.400
You knew I'd screw things up
with Kristen.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.469
You wanted me to,

20:05.537 --> 20:08.038
so that she'd give you the legal
guardianship, and not me.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.308
It was a giant manipulation.

20:13.311 --> 20:16.814
Do you realize
how crazy that sounds?

20:16.882 --> 20:20.318
I'm not the bad guy, Ryan.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.087
Just stay out of my life.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.422
Ryan, wait.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.928
It was good
to hear your voice, son.
