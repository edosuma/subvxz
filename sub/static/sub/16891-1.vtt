00:02.901 --> 00:04.133
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me:

00:04.133 --> 00:05.901
Told you he'd be back.
Listen, kid,

00:05.901 --> 00:07.968
this job is balls out
or no balls at all.

00:07.968 --> 00:09.801
Yes. Balls to the wall.
Got it.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.334
All right. Go get them.

00:11.334 --> 00:13.033
Come on, guys! We gotta go!

00:17.300 --> 00:23.167
Okay, you have got to stop
beating yourself up about this.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.334
I really appreciate
what you've been doing

00:25.334 --> 00:27.234
for the both of us.
Don't mention it.

00:27.234 --> 00:29.067
Those things I said
about hating you...

00:29.067 --> 00:31.000
No, no. No, no. Listen.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.467
Forget about that. I know.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.100
You don't hate me. You don't
blame me. I blame myself.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.467
No, you shouldn't.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.400
I talked him into being
a firefighter.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.567
Yeah, did he wanna do it? Yeah,
but, you know,

00:40.567 --> 00:42.067
I pushed him in that direction.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.634
You promise the world to
your children and your wife,

00:44.634 --> 00:46.901
and then you spend
half of your waking hours

00:46.901 --> 00:49.033
spoon feeding
your brain-damaged godson

00:49.033 --> 00:52.501
and giving emotional support
to your ex-girlfriend.

00:52.501 --> 00:54.901
I'm guessing she wasn't
the designated driver.

00:54.901 --> 00:56.601
She reminds you
of your daughter.

00:56.601 --> 00:58.100
I get it, okay, Tommy?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.934
But this is here,
and this is now.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.234
You're drinking too much.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.467
I'm trying to explain
something to you here.

01:03.467 --> 01:04.534
Let's get a drink.

01:04.534 --> 01:06.934
Dad! Ohh!

01:06.934 --> 01:08.200
Dad!

01:08.200 --> 01:10.567
Go to hell.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.667
You may have saved
our daughter.

01:13.667 --> 01:17.367
Yeah.
Hey, do you want to, um...

01:17.367 --> 01:18.934
Yeah.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.167
Tonight?

01:20.167 --> 01:22.267
Might as well strike
while the iron's hot.

02:32.601 --> 02:33.801
Hey!

02:35.367 --> 02:37.501
What are you doing?

02:37.501 --> 02:39.534
Nothing. I tripped.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.634
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

02:41.634 --> 02:43.701
Yeah.
Did he talk?

02:43.701 --> 02:45.701
What?
I mean, did he do anything?

02:45.701 --> 02:47.334
No.
Oh, okay, no.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.968
I know. It's totally insane.
It's just that, you know,

02:49.968 --> 02:51.834
whenever I leave here
without him,

02:51.834 --> 02:54.167
I always feel like,
you know, um,

02:54.167 --> 02:56.701
something's gonna happen
when I'm out of here.

02:56.701 --> 02:59.100
I mean, obviously
I know you're gonna call me

02:59.100 --> 03:03.067
if he talks or walks
or something, but I don't know.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.701
I get really panicky,
you know,

03:04.701 --> 03:07.167
when I'm on my way home
and I'm coming up the block,

03:07.167 --> 03:09.801
I'm walking in the building,
coming up the elevator.

03:09.801 --> 03:12.000
I feel like I'll walk in,
you'll be like,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.901
"he just talked," or something.
I don't know. Did he talk?

03:14.901 --> 03:17.300
What?
Did he talk?

03:17.300 --> 03:18.834
No.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.501
I know. Duh.
It's just... Sorry.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.334
Are you all right?

03:23.334 --> 03:27.434
Yeah. Just... I'm gonna
clean this stuff up.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.934
<i>* On another day</i>
<i>C'mon, c'mon *</i>

03:48.934 --> 03:52.701
<i>* With these ropes tied tight</i>
<i>Can we do no wrong? *</i>

03:52.701 --> 03:55.534

04:29.367 --> 04:32.300
Yes. Yes, certainly.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.801
The truth is as your age
increases, so do the risks.

04:35.801 --> 04:38.467
At age 40, the chances
of Down Syndrome occurring

04:38.467 --> 04:40.601
are one in 109.

04:40.601 --> 04:45.567
At age 43, that risk
increases to one in 53.

04:45.567 --> 04:50.434
Having said that, you have
a healthy two-year-old at home.

04:50.434 --> 04:52.767
You take good care of yourself.

04:52.767 --> 04:56.467
All your key blood
and physical numbers are good.

04:56.467 --> 05:00.734
It's a chance you should
really think about taking.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.934
You'll have to come in
for further tests

05:02.934 --> 05:04.634
and checkups all along the way,

05:04.634 --> 05:07.033
and I would expect that
any little doubt or pain

05:07.033 --> 05:09.534
or ache is something
you pay rapt attention to,

05:11.334 --> 05:14.267
but you've gotta make
your mind up.

05:14.267 --> 05:16.601
You gotta be certain.

05:16.601 --> 05:18.801
You've discussed this
with your husband,

05:18.801 --> 05:21.267
the decision
whether to go ahead or not?

05:22.501 --> 05:24.501
No. I haven't.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.033
It's complicated.

05:29.033 --> 05:32.033
So is the pregnancy.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.567
When were you gonna tell me?

05:51.567 --> 05:54.400
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

06:00.734 --> 06:02.067
I wasn't.

06:37.634 --> 06:39.667
How'd you find out?

06:41.601 --> 06:43.634
The <i>Blame</i> book.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.934
Yeah.
You know, sometimes I read.

06:48.934 --> 06:52.734
Sometimes I see books
in the house,

06:52.734 --> 06:56.267
and I peruse them.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.701
You read the <i>Blame</i> book?

07:02.334 --> 07:05.100
I thought there might be
a picture of me in it.

07:08.901 --> 07:12.100
I was pulling out
the Johnny Unitas book.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.934
Johnny Unitas was...

07:13.934 --> 07:16.767
Yeah, about how to play
professional football.

07:16.767 --> 07:17.934
Yeah.

07:17.934 --> 07:21.167
Yeah, I know. I read it
when Connor was 8.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.868
He wanted to play quarterback.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.934
I thought he just had a natural,
uh...

07:25.934 --> 07:26.968
Spiral?

07:26.968 --> 07:30.834
Nope. That was me.
Chapter four.

07:37.133 --> 07:41.667
Listen,
I wanna have this kid.

07:43.033 --> 07:45.200
What?

07:50.300 --> 07:53.634
The only way
that I will have this kid

07:53.634 --> 07:57.234
is if you promise to be
a normal, close-to-home dad.

07:57.234 --> 08:02.033
Okay? Teach him or her
how to play football, okay?

08:02.033 --> 08:04.400
And teach them
right from wrong.

08:07.334 --> 08:09.968
Normal.

08:09.968 --> 08:13.100
We are way beyond

08:13.100 --> 08:17.467
goddamn normal at this point.

08:17.467 --> 08:21.300
All of that shit disappeared

08:21.300 --> 08:23.501
after those planes
hit those towers,

08:23.501 --> 08:27.133
after Jimmy died, after you...

08:27.133 --> 08:30.067
not in so many words,
but after you told me

08:30.067 --> 08:33.801
to get over it and grow up.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.567
That's not fair.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.366
Okay?

08:37.366 --> 08:41.734
I got news for you.
There's no getting over it.

08:41.734 --> 08:44.133
Normal...

08:44.133 --> 08:49.133
Normal is dead and buried
underneath Ground Zero.

08:51.501 --> 08:55.734
I'm just trying to make sense
outta what's left above ground.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.300
Get out.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.267
Get out.

09:11.267 --> 09:14.033
No. I'm not... That...

09:15.667 --> 09:19.501
Wait. What are you...?
Ah, Jesus Christ. Get ba...

09:20.634 --> 09:22.100
Unbelievable.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.667
Honey, get in the car.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.567
It's absolutely freezing
out here.

09:30.767 --> 09:32.367
Get in the car.

09:34.267 --> 09:36.133
Now.

09:44.267 --> 09:45.901
Jesus.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.167
Honey.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.434
Hey.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.901
Honey.

09:58.133 --> 10:00.467
What are you...? Hey. Hey.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.968
Hey.

10:01.968 --> 10:04.234
Jesus. Stop the car.
Now, okay...

10:04.234 --> 10:06.467
Get off the car!

10:06.467 --> 10:07.634
Get off the car!

10:07.634 --> 10:10.968
I... Jesus Chri... Hey!

10:10.968 --> 10:12.734
What is wrong with you?
Get off!

10:12.734 --> 10:13.968
Aw, shit.

10:13.968 --> 10:17.067
I'm... What are you...
Are you goddamn crazy?

10:17.067 --> 10:19.167
Tommy, this is
a professional building.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.567
People are watching. Get off.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.434
All right, goddamn it.
Pull over now.

10:23.434 --> 10:25.200
Tommy, get off the car.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.767
Stop the car.
Okay.

10:26.767 --> 10:31.734
I... What are you...? No.
No, no, no. Ahh. I'm sorry.

10:31.734 --> 10:33.734
I'm sorry. Ahh.

10:39.467 --> 10:41.634
Jesus Christ.

10:44.534 --> 10:46.634
Oh, my God.

10:48.968 --> 10:52.467
Oh, my God.
Um, is that my purse?

10:52.467 --> 10:55.701
Uh, yes. Uh, you left it
in my, uh... Here.

10:55.701 --> 10:57.067
Thanks.

10:57.067 --> 10:58.467
Are you okay?

10:58.467 --> 10:59.968
Yeah.

10:59.968 --> 11:02.934
I'm sorry.
This is my husband Tommy.

11:02.934 --> 11:05.267
Hi. Ow.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.801
Hi.

11:07.801 --> 11:11.100
Let's get in the car, honey.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.300
Yes.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.000
Nice... Nice...

11:15.000 --> 11:17.467
Nice... You, too.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.567
I'm back.

11:27.567 --> 11:28.601
Hey.

11:28.601 --> 11:29.901
Hey.

11:29.901 --> 11:32.567
Ugh...

11:32.567 --> 11:34.767
All right.

11:34.767 --> 11:35.801
Hey.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.801
Did you get the crudités?

11:37.801 --> 11:40.667
That's the broccoli,
cauliflower, and carrot thing?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.934
Yes. I got it.

11:42.934 --> 11:44.634
And the vinaigrette?

11:44.634 --> 11:46.100
That's the Paul Newman thing?

11:46.100 --> 11:48.033
With Paul Newman's face
on the bottle.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.167
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I got it.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.167
What about the extra virgin
olive oil?

11:51.167 --> 11:53.033
Is that with
Rachael Ray's face on it?

11:53.033 --> 11:54.501
- Yes.
- Got it.

11:54.501 --> 11:56.167
Applesauce?

11:56.167 --> 11:57.734
Who's face was on that?

11:57.734 --> 11:59.334
No one's.

11:59.334 --> 12:00.834
Oh, shit.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.701
Oh, come on.

12:02.701 --> 12:05.934
Tommy, that's Damian's favorite
to have with the lamb.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.367
I'll just unload this shit, and
I'll go back down and get it.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.133
Why can't they have somebody's
face on the applesauce,

12:12.133 --> 12:15.200
like, isn't Gwyneth Paltrow's
kid named after an apple?

12:15.200 --> 12:18.868
I think all the food
should have famous faces on it

12:18.868 --> 12:21.033
so, you know, you can
keep track of it, like,

12:21.033 --> 12:24.267
you know, Gwyneth Paltrow
on the applesauce

12:24.267 --> 12:28.400
and George Lopez on beans.
Nicolas Cage on canned hams.

12:29.868 --> 12:32.801
It's funny, right?
Because he's so over the...

12:32.801 --> 12:34.400
Mm-hm.

12:36.734 --> 12:39.033
I know.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.667
Don't. Don't.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.234
What was that?

12:43.234 --> 12:45.567
What?

12:45.567 --> 12:47.534
What are you laughing at?

12:47.534 --> 12:48.634
What you just said.

12:48.634 --> 12:52.801
Yeah, about, um,
Nick Nolte.

12:52.801 --> 12:54.033
Nicolas Cage.

12:54.033 --> 12:55.634
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

12:55.634 --> 12:57.467
Uh-huh.

12:58.701 --> 13:02.434
Mm-hm.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.601
What's the, uh,
what's with the whispering?

13:06.434 --> 13:07.901
I can't. I can't. Okay.

13:07.901 --> 13:09.567
Listen,

13:09.567 --> 13:14.033
you have really great legs.

13:15.868 --> 13:17.968
- Really?
- Yes, really.

13:17.968 --> 13:20.901
And they are...

13:20.901 --> 13:24.100
They're just, kind of, um...

13:24.100 --> 13:26.734
What?
Girly.

13:26.734 --> 13:28.434
What?

13:28.434 --> 13:30.968
I don't have girl legs.
What are you talking about?

13:30.968 --> 13:34.868
But they also look...
They look great on a man.

13:34.868 --> 13:36.100
Uh-huh.
Yes.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.968
I've been around
long enough to know

13:37.968 --> 13:40.467
that's not what you girls...

13:40.467 --> 13:43.601
You didn't start talking about
my legs just all of a sudden.

13:43.601 --> 13:46.267
You had to be talking
about something else.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.501
What?
I'm sorry, sweetheart. What?

13:51.501 --> 13:54.801
What?
Were you talking about my...?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.634
Oh!
Get over yourself, Tommy.

13:56.634 --> 13:58.501
Come on!
I mean, seriously.

13:58.501 --> 14:00.434
We did not talk
about your penis.

14:00.434 --> 14:01.534
Did we?
No.

14:01.534 --> 14:03.434
All right.
No penis.

14:03.434 --> 14:05.033
Today.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.133
Gonna get the applesauce now.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.868
Don't go! Don't go away mad!

14:13.868 --> 14:16.267
Just go away!

14:18.801 --> 14:20.367
All right.

14:20.367 --> 14:25.434
Ah, it's official. I am losing
my goddamn mind, okay?

14:25.434 --> 14:27.834
Thirteen days without a fire?
It's ridiculous.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.901
We have to do garbage jobs,
frozen pipes.

14:29.901 --> 14:32.133
I just came... I went upstairs.
I read the last

14:32.133 --> 14:34.000
old <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
I could read.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.601
I tried to jerk off
to Megan Fox

14:35.601 --> 14:38.534
on the cover of a <i>Maxim</i> magazine
that had a coffee stain on it.

14:38.534 --> 14:40.033
You sure that was coffee?

14:40.033 --> 14:41.334
I'm serious, Lou.

14:41.334 --> 14:42.901
Gonna take those magazines,

14:42.901 --> 14:45.501
light them on fire so we have
something to put out.

14:45.501 --> 14:46.901
Shh!
Come on. Do you mind?

14:46.901 --> 14:48.534
They're watching
<i>Jersey Shore.</i>

14:48.534 --> 14:50.067
This show is racist, man.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.767
It makes Italians
look like we're

14:51.767 --> 14:54.133
stupid idiots with perfectly
chiseled bodies,

14:54.133 --> 14:56.467
fake tans, and gay haircuts.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.467
I don't have a gay haircut,
guys.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.934
You think this shit is racist?

15:01.934 --> 15:04.100
What about <i>Flavor of Love</i>
with Flavor Flav?

15:04.100 --> 15:06.567
Walking around with
his gold fronts in his mouth,

15:06.567 --> 15:08.534
big clock
around his skinny-ass neck,

15:08.534 --> 15:11.701
popping champagne bottles, bunch
of loudmouthed chicken heads

15:11.701 --> 15:13.534
screaming and fighting
each other,

15:13.534 --> 15:15.934
trying to marry him
because he used to be famous.

15:15.934 --> 15:19.300
Is that true representation
of the folks in my community?

15:20.801 --> 15:22.801
Don't answer that question,
all right?

15:22.801 --> 15:23.934
This show is racist.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.033
Give me that remote.

15:25.033 --> 15:27.567
No, no, no. Come on, man.
Bullshit.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

15:29.467 --> 15:32.167
Guys, seriously.
I'm missing the show.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.300
Give me the thing.
Knock it off!

15:34.300 --> 15:35.934
What's the matter
with you guys?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.267
Ain't a playground.
It's a firehouse.

15:38.267 --> 15:39.634
Hey, listen.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.467
How many times
I gotta tell you guys?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.868
Replace the toilet paper roll
when it's out.

15:43.868 --> 15:46.234
I had to duck walk down
to the storage closet

15:46.234 --> 15:48.300
and back. Now I got a rash.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.701
Chief, you've had a rash
since I've known you.

15:50.701 --> 15:53.167
Yeah, now my rash
has a rash, Lou.

15:53.167 --> 15:56.033
My crotch is like a goddamn
Republican landslide.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.567
Wanna see a fire you
can put out? Here. Put this out.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.634
- Whoa!
- Chill out, man.

16:00.634 --> 16:02.400
Quit your bitching.
Pipe down.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.133
- Sit. Food's ready.
- Yeah!

16:04.133 --> 16:05.334
Finally. Come on.

16:05.334 --> 16:08.300
Mikey, grab some plates
will you, please?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.300
Goddamn it.

16:14.501 --> 16:15.634
You need a hand?

16:15.634 --> 16:18.400
Nah. Nah, man. I'm good. Thanks.

16:24.868 --> 16:26.000
What about you?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.767
What about me, what?

16:27.767 --> 16:29.033
I mean, come on, man.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.100
You're looming over me
like a dark cloud.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.701
Aw, shit. My bad, son.

16:32.701 --> 16:37.501
Just bored, you know.
I was just bored.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.334
Trouble with the vag?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.434
The vagina. Your girl.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.501
Ah, shit, nah, son.

16:46.501 --> 16:49.767
Everything's... Everything...
No trouble there.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.868
Maybe. A little.

16:53.334 --> 16:56.634
All right, well,
let me be the judge of that.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.567
Judge vagina. Lay it out.

16:58.567 --> 17:02.834
Heh, okay, Judge vagina.

17:03.968 --> 17:05.534
Oh.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.000
You know, when you can...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.200
And then there's like
this little...

17:21.200 --> 17:23.567
Uh, and there's a
feeling right there.

17:23.567 --> 17:24.666
Yeah.

17:24.666 --> 17:27.733
Then when it gets in this...

17:27.733 --> 17:30.167
Crazy. Ah, shit.

17:30.167 --> 17:31.968
I wanna marry Colleen.

17:42.634 --> 17:43.767
Do it.

17:43.767 --> 17:44.934
Do it?

17:44.934 --> 17:47.734
Pop the question.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.868
Pop the what? Do it?
Pop the question?

17:49.868 --> 17:52.067
Yeah.
Coming from Mr. America's

17:52.067 --> 17:53.567
most wanted with the girls?

17:53.567 --> 17:55.701
Uh, hey, now,
order in the court. Listen.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.267
Let's be real, okay?
It's me.

17:58.267 --> 18:00.100
You came to me
to ask me whether or not

18:00.100 --> 18:02.334
you should marry this girl
probably because

18:02.334 --> 18:04.501
everybody in this house
knows I'm a playboy

18:04.501 --> 18:06.767
and you thought I was gonna
talk you out of it.

18:06.767 --> 18:09.167
What that says to me
is you really love this girl,

18:09.167 --> 18:11.100
you want to marry her,
and that's cool.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.267
It's that your nuts are crawled
up somewhere behind your pelvis,

18:14.267 --> 18:16.801
and you can't work up the nerve
to pop the question.

18:16.801 --> 18:19.834
I mean, I tell you what, Shawn.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.934
I seen the way
this girl looks at you.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.467
She loves you.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.667
She'll say yes.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.200
All you gotta do is, you know,

18:26.200 --> 18:29.367
man up and ask. That's it.

18:29.367 --> 18:30.868
Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Wait. Wait.

18:30.868 --> 18:34.300
What happened to Franco,
Mr. Pussy Man?

18:34.300 --> 18:36.167
Mr. Pussy Man.
I mean, Mr., you know,

18:36.167 --> 18:37.734
"I hit the skins and scram,

18:37.734 --> 18:39.033
and I'm in, and I'm out."

18:39.033 --> 18:41.501
What happened to all that?
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn,

18:41.501 --> 18:43.667
I may hound-dog my way
around the boroughs,

18:43.667 --> 18:47.033
but I still remember what it
feels like to love a girl,

18:47.033 --> 18:49.501
you know, to have somebody
that's in your corner,

18:49.501 --> 18:51.801
make you feel like
you can do anything,

18:51.801 --> 18:54.234
you know, maybe
scratch your big peanut head

18:54.234 --> 18:55.701
while you watch TV

18:55.701 --> 18:57.868
and just be sweet
for no good goddamn reason

18:57.868 --> 19:00.634
other than that
she's crazy about you.

19:00.634 --> 19:01.968
Man, I get it.

19:01.968 --> 19:04.534
And I tell you what,
I ain't pulling none of that

19:04.534 --> 19:06.934
out at the club scalping
pussies in the V.I.P.,

19:06.934 --> 19:12.334
but you, you got real love
standing right in front of you,

19:12.334 --> 19:14.167
and I don't know, man.
I envy you.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.634
I do got that standing right
in front of me, don't I?

19:18.634 --> 19:21.834
Yeah, like a Fifth Avenue bus
bearing down on your black ass,

19:21.834 --> 19:23.467
you sure as hell do.

19:23.467 --> 19:24.701
Damn.

19:24.701 --> 19:27.167
I guess there's not much trouble
there after all.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.501
Nah, I wouldn't say that.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.267
I mean, it's not my kind of
trouble. It's not fun trouble.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.701
It's just trouble
of a different kind.

19:36.701 --> 19:38.133
Good luck, Romeo.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.968
You know, um,
you may need this.

19:41.968 --> 19:43.567
Comes in handy.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.334
Shit.

19:51.033 --> 19:52.834
Hey, honey, I'm home.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.868
I thought we could take
the kids to the, uh...

19:58.834 --> 20:00.334
Hi.
Hi.

20:01.901 --> 20:07.667
Did I just enter my apartment
or another dimension? What's...

20:07.667 --> 20:09.534
Janet had
a doctor's appointment,

20:09.534 --> 20:11.667
and Damian is
at physical therapy,

20:11.667 --> 20:13.467
so I offered to make lunch

20:13.467 --> 20:15.567
before Shawn
takes the kids to the museum.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.033
Okay.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.000
Where's Colleen?
At work.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.067
Oh, she got a job?
Yeah, at the bar.

20:22.067 --> 20:23.501
Whose idea was that?

20:23.501 --> 20:25.667
I don't know.
Janet seemed fine with it.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.801
Well, I'm not fine with it.

20:26.801 --> 20:28.501
Well, then
get your ass down there.

20:28.501 --> 20:30.601
You're her sponsor.
Go figure it out.

20:30.601 --> 20:33.534
Well, I will,

20:33.534 --> 20:36.667
just as soon as I help
Katy with her, uh, homework.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.801
I already did,
and the baby is fed

20:38.801 --> 20:41.434
and changed and now is napping.

20:41.434 --> 20:43.667
Auntie Sheila, can I...

20:43.667 --> 20:45.300
Thank you.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.534
Hi, Dad.

20:49.534 --> 20:51.567
Hi.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.167
When did...? What...?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.300
Okay, what's happening?

20:58.300 --> 20:59.367
What, with the sandwich?

20:59.367 --> 21:01.968
No, no, no,
with you and Janet.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.000
What's...? What is this?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.434
Oh. What? We bonded.

21:05.901 --> 21:09.267
Don't, she's like the sister
that I never had.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.467
Really? Okay,
sweetheart,

21:10.467 --> 21:12.367
I'm pretty sure
if you had a sister,

21:12.367 --> 21:13.968
you'd have drowned her
in the bathtub

21:13.968 --> 21:15.567
by the time she was age 6.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.100
If she was prettier than me,

21:17.100 --> 21:18.868
she wouldn't have made it
outta the womb.

21:18.868 --> 21:21.634
Hah! I'm serious.

21:21.634 --> 21:23.968
Is this like
a frenemy thing?

21:23.968 --> 21:26.067
Are you gonna be like
best friends with her and...

21:28.767 --> 21:30.868
You're not thinking of
taking that baby, are you?

21:32.300 --> 21:35.834
Boy, you kidnap one kid, and
then everybody automatic... No!

21:35.834 --> 21:37.934
Tommy, don't be so naive.

21:37.934 --> 21:41.367
All right? Janet and I
have been at war,

21:41.367 --> 21:44.234
and we have been entrenched
against each other,

21:44.234 --> 21:48.434
but now we are
entrenched together.

21:48.434 --> 21:49.634
Against me.

21:49.634 --> 21:53.834
No, not against you,
for each other.

21:53.834 --> 21:54.834
Do you know what I mean?

21:54.834 --> 21:56.501
Against the world
and tragedy

21:56.501 --> 21:58.868
and bad and hurt
and ugly.

21:58.868 --> 21:59.868
Mm-hm.
Listen.

21:59.868 --> 22:01.267
You guys have
the brotherhood,

22:01.267 --> 22:03.701
so we have the motherhood.

22:03.701 --> 22:04.968
Oh, really?
How about that?

22:04.968 --> 22:05.968
Mm-hm.

22:05.968 --> 22:08.400
Which reminds me,

22:08.400 --> 22:10.934
I, um... I wouldn't try
to make any attempts

22:10.934 --> 22:12.734
at getting intimate
with Janet,

22:12.734 --> 22:14.868
because she's not feeling
very sexy right now.

22:14.868 --> 22:15.868
What?

22:15.868 --> 22:18.567
She's anxious about checkups

22:18.567 --> 22:20.901
and dangers and Colleen
and blah, blah, blah.

22:20.901 --> 22:22.734
So, um, basically
the bottom line is

22:22.734 --> 22:25.000
that your dick's flying solo
for the next six months.

22:26.534 --> 22:29.434
Okay, I know
she did not say that.

22:29.434 --> 22:31.334
Ye... I'm interpreting,
all right?

22:31.334 --> 22:32.667
She and I talked,

22:32.667 --> 22:35.067
and now I'm reading between
the lines for you.

22:35.067 --> 22:37.033
All right? It's called
empathy and sympathy.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.601
You ever heard of that?
I don't know.

22:38.601 --> 22:40.767
Use it. Improve your marriage.

22:40.767 --> 22:42.968
Look, I am. I'm really
trying to help you, okay?

22:42.968 --> 22:44.701
She doesn't need to
be pressured.

22:44.701 --> 22:48.167
She needs love and support
and tenderness,

22:48.167 --> 22:51.501
not a walking hard-on
with a fire helmet.

22:52.567 --> 22:54.534
Which reminds me,
we need jelly,

22:54.534 --> 22:55.467
so put that on the list.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.367
She did not say,

22:58.367 --> 23:00.434
"Walking hard-on
with a fire helmet."

23:00.434 --> 23:02.968
No, yeah, she did.
Those were her exact words.

23:02.968 --> 23:05.133
Okay, this is bullshit.
I know it's bullshit,

23:05.133 --> 23:07.834
because whenever she's pregnant,
she likes to have a lot of sex.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.167
It's one of her things.

23:09.167 --> 23:12.868
Oh? Well, see,
her things now, ahem,

23:12.868 --> 23:16.033
are amniocentesis
and extreme nausea

23:16.033 --> 23:18.868
and heavy spotting and
little bit of anal leakage.

23:18.868 --> 23:20.067
It's not about your pee-pee.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.501
Uh, you're probably right.

23:24.501 --> 23:25.701
It's not,

23:25.701 --> 23:26.801
especially when the words

23:26.801 --> 23:29.767
spotting and leakage
are involved.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.601
What else are you adding
to the list?

23:31.601 --> 23:33.000
Hand lotion.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.334
No, you have some already.

23:34.334 --> 23:36.234
Think I'm gonna need
my own private bottle.

23:38.367 --> 23:39.634
Ew!
Yeah.

23:39.634 --> 23:40.834
Well, you're the one who said

23:40.834 --> 23:42.934
my dick was gonna be
flying solo.

23:42.934 --> 23:45.067
I did not tell you
to foam the runway.

23:46.868 --> 23:48.067
Ew.

23:48.067 --> 23:49.067
Go see Colleen.

23:49.067 --> 23:50.901
Oh, I'm going
to see Colleen.

23:50.901 --> 23:53.801
I am going to see Colleen
right...

23:53.801 --> 23:58.901
Hi. How...
How was your sandwich?

24:11.534 --> 24:13.567
Hey.
What the hell you doing?

24:13.567 --> 24:15.033
What's it look like?
I'm working.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.834
Oh, by the way,
I own the joint.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.367
Yeah. Right. Right.

24:18.367 --> 24:19.400
You own this joint?

24:19.400 --> 24:20.901
Yeah. Somebody at Eddie's
law firm

24:20.901 --> 24:22.667
found out he didn't
have a liquor license

24:22.667 --> 24:24.267
and threatened
to have him disbarred

24:24.267 --> 24:27.200
if he didn't dump the joint,
so me and Mick took over.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.300
You and Mickey own the bar?

24:29.300 --> 24:31.033
Yeah.
Cash on the barrel.

24:31.033 --> 24:32.501
Me and Mick,
50-50.

24:32.501 --> 24:34.701
And I still got the shotgun
under the bar,

24:34.701 --> 24:37.367
so someone tries to
take the place away from me,

24:37.367 --> 24:40.067
I'm gonna give them a shot
on the house, buckshot.

24:40.067 --> 24:41.601
You guys,

24:41.601 --> 24:43.100
do you think
it's a really good idea

24:43.100 --> 24:44.501
for two alkies
to own a bar?

24:44.501 --> 24:46.701
There wasn't another
hobby you guys could take up?

24:46.701 --> 24:48.100
Uh, I can't fight
fires anymore.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.200
I gotta do something
to keep my life interesting.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.667
You know, try yoga,
Pilates, goddamn Facebook.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.868
I can't do that stuff,
because I'm a heterosexual,

24:56.868 --> 24:59.200
a heavily armed
heterosexual.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.801
Yeah. Wouldn't know it
by that shirt.

25:00.801 --> 25:02.234
There she is.
Hey, honey.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.534
Hey. Hey, grab your shit.
We're going home.

25:04.534 --> 25:05.734
What do you mean she's going?

25:05.734 --> 25:06.834
She's going home.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.000
She's got three hours left.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.567
Her shift is over, all right?

25:09.567 --> 25:11.067
Listen, it's a
brilliant system?

25:11.067 --> 25:13.601
Oh, really?
All AA all the time,

25:13.601 --> 25:15.033
day and night.
Uh-huh.

25:15.033 --> 25:17.434
Hey, it's no sense in denying
that the booze is out there.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.934
The entire staff
is in the program.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.834
Everybody watches out
for everybody else.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.667
Nobody skims off the top.
Nobody drinks up the inventory.

25:23.667 --> 25:24.968
Whole place is on the
up and up.

25:24.968 --> 25:26.133
Mm-hm.
Besides,

25:26.133 --> 25:27.901
Colleen's sponsor
can keep an eye on her.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.000
Okay, that's impossible.
I'm her sponsor.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.400
No, no. I'm her sponsor.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.033
No, no, no.
I'm her sponsor.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.501
I said I'm her sponsor!

25:34.501 --> 25:35.801
Hey, keep your voice down.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.067
Dad, no, okay, it's him.
He's my sponsor now.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.067
Give me one good reason
he shouldn't be.

25:41.267 --> 25:42.868
I'll give you
a million good reasons,

25:42.868 --> 25:44.834
but here's number one:
I'm your father, okay?

25:44.834 --> 25:46.367
I said a good reason.

25:48.367 --> 25:49.567
Listen, little girl.

25:49.567 --> 25:51.601
I'm the one
who got you sober, okay, so...

25:51.601 --> 25:52.634
Dad. What?

25:52.634 --> 25:53.868
You did your part, okay?

25:53.868 --> 25:55.667
You got me to see
what I was doing to myself,

25:55.667 --> 25:57.667
but I gotta take
the wheels now.

25:57.667 --> 26:01.133
You can't be my father
and my sponsor.

26:01.133 --> 26:03.267
You have a hard enough time
with the father part.

26:03.267 --> 26:04.200
Ouch.

26:06.801 --> 26:09.501
Okay, just for
your information,

26:09.501 --> 26:11.200
one of the reasons
I came down here today

26:11.200 --> 26:14.167
was because I wanted... I wanted
to take you to a meeting, okay?

26:14.167 --> 26:16.067
So that... What?
Okay. Well, don't worry,

26:16.067 --> 26:17.767
because we have one here
after closing.

26:17.767 --> 26:19.200
What?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.067
Yeah. The whole staff
sticks around for it.

26:21.067 --> 26:23.434
Some of the best meetings
I've ever been to happen here.

26:23.434 --> 26:24.801
We all know each other.

26:24.801 --> 26:27.100
Plus, since we get to see
on a minute-by-minute basis

26:27.100 --> 26:29.968
just how stupid everyone gets
even after a couple of drinks,

26:29.968 --> 26:32.601
it's like a constant reminder
of how lucky we are to be sober.

26:32.601 --> 26:34.267
Plus, you know,
people tip like crazy

26:34.267 --> 26:36.534
when they're shitfaced.
I made 300 bucks last night.

26:36.534 --> 26:38.234
Well, maybe I'll just
come down later,

26:38.234 --> 26:40.400
and join you guys...
No.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.901
I'm sorry, Dad, but
it's for employees only.

26:44.901 --> 26:46.801
Plus, I don't know.
I feel kind of weird

26:46.801 --> 26:48.567
being in meetings with you.
What?

26:48.567 --> 26:51.367
No offense. I just,
I can't really open up

26:51.367 --> 26:53.734
like I can with these guys,
heh.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.234
Okay.

26:59.234 --> 27:01.400
AA meetings in a bar.
Great idea.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.601
I'd like to stay, but I can't,

27:02.601 --> 27:04.601
because I've got a Gamblers
Anonymous meeting

27:04.601 --> 27:07.367
over at the Borgata,
okay?

27:07.367 --> 27:10.100
Call me when she starts
drinking, assholes.

27:38.901 --> 27:40.100
Hi, baby.

27:41.167 --> 27:42.100
Hey.

27:43.167 --> 27:45.300
Hey. Oh, you
got everything?

27:45.300 --> 27:47.167
I got everything.
Great.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.801
Kids asleep?
Yep.

27:51.267 --> 27:53.100
Look, we have to decide

27:53.100 --> 27:55.367
if we wanna know if the baby's
a boy or a girl or not.

27:55.367 --> 27:59.300
Honey, it's up to you.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.868
What?
Yeah.

28:03.501 --> 28:05.601
Really?
It's up to you.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.133
Because with
the other three kids,

28:07.133 --> 28:08.501
we got in huge fights
over this,

28:08.501 --> 28:11.167
because you always wanna know,
and I don't wanna know.

28:11.167 --> 28:14.000
And then with Katy,
you snuck behind my back

28:14.000 --> 28:15.200
to find out
what sex she was.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.834
Well, I knew, but this time,
it's different.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.968
It's completely up to you.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.467
Okay. Great.

28:26.267 --> 28:31.067
And I gotta say, honey,
you look gorgeous right now.

28:32.701 --> 28:34.567
You always look good
when you're pregnant,

28:34.567 --> 28:38.534
but this time around,
you just look stunning.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.934
Thanks. I mean, you're just...

28:43.067 --> 28:44.200
you're glowing.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.400
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:49.133 --> 28:50.434
Hmm.

28:51.801 --> 28:53.400
Tommy...

28:53.400 --> 28:55.934
Shh.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.467
I know.

28:59.300 --> 29:03.267
Okay?
It's, it's all right.

29:03.267 --> 29:04.200
What's all right?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.200
I've been watching you,
I've been listening to you.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.467
I've been reading
between the lines,

29:12.734 --> 29:16.467
and, uh, don't worry.
It's okay.

29:17.534 --> 29:18.767
What's okay?

29:18.767 --> 29:21.734
If you don't wanna make love

29:21.734 --> 29:24.534
because you're worried,

29:24.534 --> 29:26.801
you know, during this
particular pregnancy. Don't.

29:26.801 --> 29:29.100
It's okay. I understand.

29:30.701 --> 29:32.667
You do?
Mm-hm.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.100
You just sensed that?

29:36.868 --> 29:38.567
Sensed it. Yeah.

29:39.901 --> 29:42.868
Wow.
Hmm.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.801
Okay.

29:44.801 --> 29:46.067
All right.
Thanks.

29:46.067 --> 29:47.501
You're welcome.

29:53.467 --> 29:55.234
Everything's gonna be fine.

29:55.234 --> 29:57.167
I checked on Colleen
down at her job.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.968
She's doing fine.
Okay.

29:58.968 --> 30:02.467
Everybody's in good hands.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.667
Just like our baby.

30:03.667 --> 30:04.667
That's right.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.100
Yeah.

30:07.467 --> 30:11.434
Oh, Tommy Gavin, you are
really full of surprises.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.567
I know.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.734
I mean,
you've, you've changed.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.567
I guess so.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.167
I like it.

30:22.701 --> 30:23.701
Hmm.

30:24.868 --> 30:27.267
I guess I'm not
just a, uh,

30:30.267 --> 30:33.100
walking hard-on.

30:38.801 --> 30:40.467
What's wrong?

30:41.567 --> 30:43.100
Did you talk to
Sheila today?

30:47.434 --> 30:48.834
Yeah. That's where
I got the list

30:48.834 --> 30:50.901
of the, the stuff to...

30:50.901 --> 30:52.501
She gave me
the shopping list.

30:52.501 --> 30:53.968
Yeah, and she told you
I called you

30:53.968 --> 30:56.000
a walking hard-on
in a fire helmet.

31:00.534 --> 31:02.100
Okay.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.734
She told me a lot of stuff.

31:03.734 --> 31:05.334
She told me the stuff to buy

31:05.334 --> 31:08.834
and she told me that
you needed tenderness and caring

31:08.834 --> 31:10.267
and, and another thing.

31:10.267 --> 31:11.467
Sympathy.
Yes.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.033
I thought that you had changed.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.667
I really was believing
what you said.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.300
I'm changing. I'm changing.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.200
I'm... I'm like
an amoeba right now.

31:19.200 --> 31:23.234
I'm just... I'm gonna,
I'm gonna be tender,

31:23.234 --> 31:26.367
and I am,
am I not being caring?

31:26.367 --> 31:27.767
And I'm gonna do
the other thing.

31:27.767 --> 31:29.767
Showing sympathy.
Yes.

31:29.767 --> 31:32.033
Okay, I don't know why
I'm forgetting that...

31:32.033 --> 31:34.367
This is real stuff,
honey.

31:36.567 --> 31:38.033
Okay.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.767
Okay. So, what about the sex?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.501
Well,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.234
I'm game if you are.

31:46.234 --> 31:50.067
Of the baby.
Oh, right.

31:50.067 --> 31:53.501
No, I'm fine with that.
Whatever. Whatever you want.

31:53.501 --> 31:54.667
Totally what you want.

31:54.667 --> 31:58.367
Okay.
And what about sex?

31:59.567 --> 32:03.801
Hey, hey, I can,
I can go four months.

32:03.801 --> 32:05.100
Six.

32:06.567 --> 32:09.167
Six months.
I can do six months.

32:11.234 --> 32:13.234
Yeah?
Yeah.

32:14.467 --> 32:15.868
Thank you.

32:17.534 --> 32:19.133
All right.

32:19.133 --> 32:21.067
Okay, now scoot.

32:21.067 --> 32:22.534
Why?

32:22.534 --> 32:25.801
Tommy, I'm getting so big,
and it is so hard to sleep now.

32:25.801 --> 32:26.968
But if you aren't in the bed,

32:26.968 --> 32:28.334
I'm gonna be
more comfortable.

32:28.334 --> 32:29.801
I really need to
sleep tonight.

32:31.434 --> 32:33.000
Sure. All right, thanks.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.167
And you have, uh, Wyatt
duty tonight. Okay.

32:35.167 --> 32:38.300
He wakes up in the middle
of the night, he's all yours.

32:38.300 --> 32:39.801
You got it.
Oh!

32:39.801 --> 32:41.167
Hand lotion.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.167
I just ran out.

32:42.167 --> 32:43.100
Oh!

32:44.467 --> 32:48.167
Well, I just,
wasn't on the list.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.234
Just, um, kind of
sensed it.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.834
Good night.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.300
Good night.

32:55.601 --> 32:57.400
Good night, baby.

33:13.734 --> 33:16.000
Hey, Col.
Hey, Boo. What's up?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.601
Not much.
Uh, I need to talk to you.

33:18.601 --> 33:21.200
Okay. Come on.
Let's go.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.400
Hey, baby, what
about our shots?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.767
In a minute,
douche bag.

33:25.767 --> 33:28.801
Baby? Did you just
call my girl "Baby"?

33:28.801 --> 33:30.901
First of all,
she's not a baby, all right?

33:30.901 --> 33:31.968
She's a lady.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.000
Second of all,
when you address the lady,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.434
you use courtesy and some
goddamn respect, all right?

33:36.434 --> 33:37.767
Third of all, will you...
Aah!

33:39.701 --> 33:40.634
Jeez.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.133
Um, Col, do you think
it's a good idea

33:53.133 --> 33:54.934
that you're working around
all this booze

33:54.934 --> 33:56.934
and these knucklehead guys
that are out there?

33:56.934 --> 33:57.968
I mean, come on.

33:57.968 --> 34:00.100
Okay, don't worry
about the booze.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.100
I've got Mickey and Teddy here,
so it's a total support system.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.634
Plus, I'm making, like,
300 bucks a night in tips.

34:05.634 --> 34:07.734
Oh. What about the guys
checking out your ass

34:07.734 --> 34:09.501
and calling you baby?

34:09.501 --> 34:13.400
Uh, you might wanna worry about
those guys just a little bit.

34:14.967 --> 34:16.701
I'm just kidding.

34:16.701 --> 34:21.434
Okay, babe, they're just
a bunch of drunken fools.

34:22.766 --> 34:24.300
You know what?

34:24.300 --> 34:27.833
On the subject of fools,
uh...

34:29.734 --> 34:31.734
Shawn, what did you do?

34:33.234 --> 34:37.033
Uh, it ain't what I did,
it's what I'm about to do.

34:45.033 --> 34:47.601
Col, will you marry me?

34:48.801 --> 34:49.734
Yes.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.567
Yes?
Yes.

34:53.567 --> 34:54.868
Yes.

34:54.868 --> 34:57.300
Does that surprise you
or scare you?

34:57.300 --> 35:01.801
Uh, heh, fifty-fifty. It's...

35:01.801 --> 35:05.968
Okay, um, do you want some
time to think it over or...

35:08.200 --> 35:10.000
No. No,
I don't need any time.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.834
I'm done with the thinking,
all right?

35:11.834 --> 35:13.334
It's time for Shawn
to start doing,

35:13.334 --> 35:15.200
and that's what
we're doing. Come on.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.467
Okay. Ha, ha.
Here you go, girl. Let's see.

35:17.467 --> 35:19.334
Oh, my God.
Ha, ha!

35:19.334 --> 35:21.033
Oh, okay.
Get up here.

35:22.934 --> 35:25.367
Oh, I'm so happy.
Me too.

35:25.367 --> 35:28.267
I am gonna make
the best wife ever.

35:29.934 --> 35:31.901
I mean,
not at first maybe,

35:31.901 --> 35:36.501
but, but eventually
I'm sure I'll be great at it.

35:36.501 --> 35:40.200
I mean, how hard
can it be, right?

35:40.200 --> 35:41.634
Right. Right.

35:41.634 --> 35:44.100
I mean, you know,
these things take time to be...

35:44.100 --> 35:45.868
Listen, I'm gonna
let you get back to work

35:45.868 --> 35:47.334
because, you gotta
get out there,

35:47.334 --> 35:49.434
make those tips, baby.
We got a wedding to pay for.

35:49.434 --> 35:50.667
I know. Oh, my God.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.367
I love you.
I love you too.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.133
Okay, bye.

36:19.634 --> 36:21.300
There goes the bride.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.067
Hey. Hey.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.467
Where is she?

36:43.467 --> 36:44.868
She's in the storage room.

36:44.868 --> 36:46.133
Yeah, Tom, I don't know.

36:46.133 --> 36:47.701
We got this system going,
and it's...

36:47.701 --> 36:49.501
It's working beautifully.
Like a charm.

36:49.501 --> 36:52.000
I don't know what happened.
Hey. Hey.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.067
You two assholes have done
enough damage as it is, okay?

36:56.434 --> 36:58.767
I'm gonna go
get my little girl.

36:58.767 --> 37:00.367
I'm gonna take her
out the back door,

37:00.367 --> 37:02.701
try to preserve whatever
dignity she's got left,

37:02.701 --> 37:06.601
and then sometime soon,
I'm gonna come back here,

37:08.367 --> 37:10.467
and then I'll deal
with the two of you

37:10.467 --> 37:15.200
in a manner
that's just and fitting.

37:19.634 --> 37:21.868
Just and fitting.

37:21.868 --> 37:24.000
What do you suppose
that means?

37:24.000 --> 37:28.634
It's gonna be fitting,
but it ain't gonna be just.

38:33.734 --> 38:36.133
Attaboy.

38:36.133 --> 38:38.300
Can't take this shit
without a shot.

38:39.667 --> 38:41.901
Amen to that.

38:41.901 --> 38:43.701
Amen to that.

38:43.701 --> 38:47.634
My kid, another one
on the way, plus Sheila.

38:47.634 --> 38:50.767
You got a full house,
brother, full goddamn house.

38:52.133 --> 38:53.634
Nerves are gonna fray,

38:53.634 --> 38:57.701
you don't got some kind of
release valve, you know.

38:59.634 --> 39:01.334
You deserve this, Tom. Go ahead.

39:01.334 --> 39:02.534
Go for it.

39:02.534 --> 39:04.834
Seriously, after
all you've been through,

39:04.834 --> 39:07.334
me, the whole Damian thing.

39:07.334 --> 39:10.067
And by the way, I think you're
doing a great job with that.

39:10.067 --> 39:13.234
Seriously. I mean, I know you
blame yourself, but don't.

39:13.234 --> 39:14.968
You're doing great.
Honestly.

39:16.234 --> 39:19.801
Hey, Tommy,
look how peaceful she is.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.334
She sleeps deep, Tom.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.601
You should be doing the same.

39:24.601 --> 39:27.100
You got the tenth anniversary
coming up.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.667
Ten years on.

39:28.667 --> 39:32.834
Ten years of grief
and anguish and blame.

39:32.834 --> 39:36.667
Wanna face that empty-handed?
Shit.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.801
I was alive, if I made it
through and you didn't,

39:38.801 --> 39:40.167
if that was Damian
laying there

39:40.167 --> 39:42.267
passed out on the floor
like that,

39:42.267 --> 39:44.567
you can bet your ass
I'd have a jar of Jameson

39:44.567 --> 39:45.834
jammed in my good hand.

39:45.834 --> 39:48.200
Bet your balls on that.

39:48.200 --> 39:52.300
After the war, lived my life
with a bottle in one paw

39:52.300 --> 39:54.567
and a goddamn ax
in the other.

39:54.567 --> 39:57.767
Only way to keep
the Nazi demons down.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.934
Get a good glow on.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.434
Sit back and relax.

40:41.567 --> 40:45.601
Hey, Tom. Tom. Tom.

40:45.601 --> 40:48.200
Last call everybody.

40:50.634 --> 40:51.801
Sweet Jesus!

40:58.934 --> 41:01.534
You know, this actually
is kind of fitting.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.734
I'm gonna go
get my daughter now.

41:15.567 --> 41:17.400
Party's over, assholes.
