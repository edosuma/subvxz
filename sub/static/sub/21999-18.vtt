00:31.460 --> 00:34.184
It should last you about
six months, give or take.

00:42.104 --> 00:44.238
What's going on?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.606
NNothing, kiddo.

00:45.608 --> 00:47.808
It's just one of the tires.

01:14.336 --> 01:16.222
Morning, Officer.

01:16.224 --> 01:17.638
Saw you working on your tire.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.673
Thought maybe I could help.

01:21.042 --> 01:22.508
Wow, that's really nice.

01:22.510 --> 01:24.877
Um, II'm already halfway done.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.250
You okay?

01:31.019 --> 01:32.885
Yeah.

01:32.887 --> 01:34.988
Since you have that mini spare
on, mind the wind.

01:34.990 --> 01:37.290
Yeah, will do.

01:37.292 --> 01:39.459
Thanks, Officer.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.001
Ma'am, what is this?

01:48.003 --> 01:49.569
What's in these little vials?

01:49.571 --> 01:51.771
It's medicine.

01:51.773 --> 01:54.874
What kind of medicine?

01:54.876 --> 01:56.976
<i>Lord, hear our prayer.</i>

01:56.978 --> 02:00.947
Let us pray for Nicholas Allen,
who still battles with leukemia.

02:00.949 --> 02:03.116
Lord, hear our prayer.

02:03.118 --> 02:04.851
Let us pray for Mary Sims,

02:04.853 --> 02:07.787
who is still recovering
from a difficult heart surgery.

02:07.789 --> 02:09.489
Lord, hear our prayer.

02:09.491 --> 02:12.892
And for anyone experiencing
any health challenges,

02:12.894 --> 02:14.127
let us pray.

02:14.129 --> 02:17.096
Lord, hear our prayer.

02:20.068 --> 02:22.702
I was out to your mother's grave

02:22.704 --> 02:24.370
not two weeks ago.

02:25.507 --> 02:27.407
I knew it was you.

02:27.409 --> 02:30.176
Mrs. Allen, so good to see you.

02:31.134 --> 02:34.047
I haven't been
in that church in eight years.

02:34.049 --> 02:37.650
After my hip replacement,
I started going to St. Mary's.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.552
It's closer to my apartment.

02:39.554 --> 02:41.454
Makes sense.

02:41.456 --> 02:44.273
I miss your mother so.

02:45.460 --> 02:49.295
Best office manager ever.

02:50.237 --> 02:53.633
Well, she always said you were
the best paralegal ever.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.803
I need a lawyer, Benny.

02:56.805 --> 02:59.939
A really good criminal lawyer.

02:59.941 --> 03:03.242
Not a real estate attorney like
your mother and I worked for,

03:03.244 --> 03:08.014
not a paper pusher, a criminal attorney.

03:09.214 --> 03:11.718
Someone like you.

03:12.175 --> 03:14.303
<i>It's an oil.</i>

03:14.305 --> 03:15.822
Made from marijuana.

03:15.824 --> 03:18.091
No, no, no.

03:18.093 --> 03:19.258
You can't get high from it.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.494
Doesn't affect the brain that way.

03:21.496 --> 03:23.715
It's typically used for pain or nausea.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.498
It's legal in New York, right?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.632
With a prescription.

03:26.634 --> 03:28.368
So this friend of yours's daughter,

03:28.370 --> 03:30.303
she lives in Virginia?

03:30.305 --> 03:33.072
Which is why she was arrested.

03:33.530 --> 03:36.743
You have to be a resident of New York

03:36.745 --> 03:39.212
to get a prescription
to purchase it here.

03:39.214 --> 03:40.793
Right. So how much did she have?

03:40.795 --> 03:43.583
Couple hundred vials.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.753
Way to bury the lede.

03:46.755 --> 03:49.489
Yeah, I know. It sounds like a lot.

03:49.491 --> 03:51.624
Well, it sounds like a lot
because it is a lot.

03:51.626 --> 03:53.626
What, was she selling them
out of the trunk of her car

03:53.628 --> 03:54.794
at the local flea market?

03:56.297 --> 03:58.664
Problem is, your friend's
daughter knew it was illegal,

03:58.666 --> 04:01.434
and she did it anyway,
not for one or two vials.

04:01.436 --> 04:03.803
Well, the way her mom explains it,

04:03.805 --> 04:08.040
she only buys it twice a year,
so she gets a really big supply.

04:08.042 --> 04:09.642
And you know...

04:09.644 --> 04:11.277
The thing is, if she lived in New York,

04:11.279 --> 04:13.679
we wouldn't even be
having this conversation.

04:13.681 --> 04:16.182
She would get it monthly, legally.

04:16.184 --> 04:18.184
You know better than I do,
it's completely irrelevant.

04:18.185 --> 04:20.987
If she wants to buy this stuff,
if she needs to buy this stuff,

04:20.988 --> 04:22.622
she should move
to a place where it's legal

04:22.624 --> 04:24.690
so she's not knowingly breaking the law.

04:24.692 --> 04:26.025
Come on, it's a Class C felony,

04:26.027 --> 04:28.428
so it's only a year, minimum sentence.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.530
We've pled out harsher charges than that.

04:30.532 --> 04:31.664
Bull...

04:31.666 --> 04:33.099
Look.

04:33.101 --> 04:35.501
I don't really ask for a lot of favors.

04:35.503 --> 04:36.736
She's being held

04:36.738 --> 04:39.172
at the Woodbury police station jail,

04:39.174 --> 04:40.440
and is being released in the morning.

04:40.442 --> 04:42.008
I'm gonna run down there tomorrow,

04:42.010 --> 04:44.777
meet her at the D.A.'s office,
where hopefully,

04:44.779 --> 04:46.679
I can negotiate a deal.

04:48.383 --> 04:50.883
I think it would make a big
difference if you were there.

04:53.221 --> 04:54.587
Wait here, please.

04:57.325 --> 05:01.260
Thank you both, for jumping into
the fray on such short notice.

05:01.262 --> 05:04.030
Your mom, my mom.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.567
This is Dr. Jason Bull, by the way.

05:07.569 --> 05:09.502
I don't have a mom in this fight,

05:09.504 --> 05:11.737
but, it's a pleasure to meet you.

05:11.739 --> 05:12.805
What kind of doctor?

05:12.807 --> 05:14.040
Psychologist.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.575
Dr. Laura Allen.

05:15.577 --> 05:16.909
Primary care physician.

05:18.913 --> 05:20.379
So, Doctor, just curious,

05:20.381 --> 05:24.817
what is it, exactly,
you use all this CBD oil for?

05:24.819 --> 05:26.486
Pain management.

05:26.488 --> 05:28.354
Headaches, mostly.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.664
Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:31.666 --> 05:32.942
Come on in.

05:32.944 --> 05:34.160
All right.

05:41.569 --> 05:43.903
Dr. Allen.

05:43.905 --> 05:47.406
I am Assistant United States
Attorney Sylvia Banner.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.909
These two gentlemen your counsel?

05:49.911 --> 05:54.714
Benjamin Colón, attorney;
Dr. Jason Bull, trial scientist.

05:54.716 --> 05:56.082
I'm sorry.

05:56.084 --> 05:58.251
II think there might
be some mistake here.

05:58.253 --> 06:00.152
I was under the impression
that we were meeting.

06:00.154 --> 06:03.556
District Attorney "Morris Frank"?

06:03.558 --> 06:04.724
From the city of Woodbury?

06:04.726 --> 06:07.693
There was a slight miscommunication.

06:07.695 --> 06:12.198
D.A. Frank was kind enough
to lend us his office.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.233
This is now a federal matter.

06:14.235 --> 06:16.102
- Federal matter?
- WWait, wait.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.337
We're talking about
a couple hundred vials

06:18.339 --> 06:21.507
of nonpsychoactive CBD oil

06:21.509 --> 06:24.143
for her personal use; I mean,

06:24.145 --> 06:26.546
doesn't the federal government
have better things to do?

06:26.995 --> 06:29.415
Actually, we don't.

06:29.831 --> 06:31.717
And it's 1,800 vials.

06:32.250 --> 06:36.155
1,800 vials that we believe

06:36.157 --> 06:38.491
were intended for sale
to no less than 27 other people

06:38.493 --> 06:39.859
in the state of Virginia.

06:39.861 --> 06:42.929
And this would not be the first
time that Dr. Allen smuggled

06:42.931 --> 06:45.197
controlled substances across state lines.

06:45.199 --> 06:47.099
TThey're for my patients.

06:47.101 --> 06:49.669
I sell them to my patients
for exactly what it costs me.

06:49.671 --> 06:51.904
You have the right to remain silent.
Dr. Allen, you are being charged

06:51.906 --> 06:54.173
with 27 counts of possession

06:54.175 --> 06:56.309
of a controlled substance
with intent to distribute

06:56.311 --> 06:57.843
in violation of federal law.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.545
In addition, you are being charged

06:59.547 --> 07:01.948
with violating interstate commerce rules,

07:01.950 --> 07:03.783
which strictly forbid the transportation

07:03.785 --> 07:05.751
across state lines
of controlled substances

07:05.753 --> 07:07.553
by persons without license to do so.

07:07.555 --> 07:10.389
Mr. Colón, please,
you have to call my mom.

07:10.391 --> 07:12.458
Don't say another word,
Dr. Allen, and don't worry,

07:12.460 --> 07:14.493
I'll make that call.

07:16.698 --> 07:22.708
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

07:29.386 --> 07:30.619
She broke the law, folks.

07:30.621 --> 07:31.853
It's the bottom line.

07:31.855 --> 07:35.157
So what we need to do
is get a jury that understands

07:35.159 --> 07:37.559
that it's not something she chose to do.

07:37.561 --> 07:39.628
She had no choice.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.030
But she did. You know that.
She had a choice.

07:42.032 --> 07:43.532
Did she?

07:44.506 --> 07:45.767
I don't think so.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.800
We are going to argue that Laura had

07:48.825 --> 07:50.817
a professional responsibility

07:50.818 --> 07:53.052
to give her patients
the best care possible.

07:53.054 --> 07:55.154
Even if it meant breaking the law.

07:55.156 --> 07:58.557
So what kind of jurors
are we looking for?

07:58.559 --> 08:02.928
What we're looking for are
jurors who are professionals.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.663
Professionals who feel a sense of duty

08:04.665 --> 08:07.900
to do their absolute best.

08:07.902 --> 08:12.238
<i>Teachers, firefighters,
emergency room doctors.</i>

08:12.240 --> 08:15.507
<i>People who relate to Laura
because, in their line of work,</i>

08:15.509 --> 08:18.611
<i>they, too, go above and beyond.</i>

08:18.613 --> 08:22.181
Do we have any teachers with us today?

08:22.183 --> 08:24.758
All right, and,
what grade do you teach?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.462
I teach ninth grade biology; I also coach

08:26.464 --> 08:27.906
the girls' basketball team.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.589
She's been at her current school
for almost 20 years.

08:30.591 --> 08:31.757
It's quite a stint.

08:31.759 --> 08:34.927
Let's say you were offered the same job

08:34.929 --> 08:37.263
at a different school,
but double the pay.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.364
Would you take it?

08:38.366 --> 08:39.465
Would I take it?

08:39.467 --> 08:40.532
I don't think so.

08:40.534 --> 08:42.268
I mean, I would never leave my girls.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.803
You can't buy what coaching
my team gives me.

08:47.344 --> 08:50.347
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

08:52.098 --> 08:56.849
What we want are jurors
who posses deontological ethics.

08:56.851 --> 08:58.384
One more time, for those of us

08:58.386 --> 09:01.020
who don't read the dictionary for fun.

09:01.022 --> 09:03.255
People who are committed
to doing their absolute best

09:03.257 --> 09:05.691
for the people who depend on them,

09:05.693 --> 09:08.594
no matter what the consequences.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.996
And what do you do for a living?

09:10.998 --> 09:12.031
II'm a county clerk.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.432
Okay.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.800
Do you like your job?

09:14.802 --> 09:16.302
I love my job.

09:16.304 --> 09:18.270
- And, how are your hours?
- You mean,

09:18.272 --> 09:19.705
when am I supposed to be there by,

09:19.707 --> 09:20.973
or when do I actually show up?

09:20.975 --> 09:22.074
Okay.

09:23.477 --> 09:25.511
Let's start with when
you're supposed to be there.

09:25.513 --> 09:26.712
9:00.

09:26.714 --> 09:28.213
And when do you usually show up?

09:28.215 --> 09:29.581
Between 7:30 and 8:00.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.550
Now, what's that about?

09:31.552 --> 09:33.786
Is the commute easier
if you get an early start?

09:33.788 --> 09:36.956
No, it's just about making
sure everything's really ready,

09:36.958 --> 09:40.225
so when people come in at 9:00,
I'm prepared to help them,

09:40.227 --> 09:43.796
and they don't have to wait
any longer than necessary.

09:47.268 --> 09:50.135
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

09:54.475 --> 09:55.874
All right.

09:57.311 --> 10:00.145
Do you believe in the rule of law?

10:00.147 --> 10:01.246
Sure do.

10:01.248 --> 10:02.848
And as a county clerk,

10:02.850 --> 10:05.818
isn't part of your job issuing permits?

10:05.820 --> 10:06.852
Among other things.

10:06.854 --> 10:09.455
So if somebody comes in,
they want a permit,

10:09.457 --> 10:12.491
they want to build a 12foot
wall in front of their house,

10:12.493 --> 10:16.428
but the code says walls
can only be eight feet.

10:16.430 --> 10:17.663
What do you do?

10:17.665 --> 10:19.765
I'd have to deny the permit.

10:19.767 --> 10:21.000
Because...?

10:21.002 --> 10:22.167
That's the law.

10:22.169 --> 10:24.837
No matter what time you get into work.

10:24.839 --> 10:27.172
No matter what time I come into work.

10:28.109 --> 10:30.909
This juror is also acceptable

10:30.911 --> 10:32.344
to the prosecution,

10:32.346 --> 10:34.079
Your Honor.

10:34.081 --> 10:36.015
We have our jury.

10:37.818 --> 10:40.019
Doctor?

10:42.723 --> 10:45.724
So, what's your thesis here?

10:45.726 --> 10:47.426
That people who love their jobs

10:47.428 --> 10:52.231
will look the other way
when a citizen breaks the law?

10:52.233 --> 10:55.601
Well, as long as you're asking,
what's <i> your</i> thesis here?

10:55.603 --> 10:59.705
Yes, she broke the law in
Virginia, but not in New York.

10:59.707 --> 11:00.939
And to what end?

11:00.941 --> 11:03.509
So that people in pain
could experience some relief?

11:03.511 --> 11:05.677
Thank goodness you're here
to make sure that evildoers

11:05.679 --> 11:08.213
like Dr. Allen
don't get away with anything.

11:09.023 --> 11:10.723
Excuse me.

11:11.648 --> 11:13.318
What was that all about?

11:13.320 --> 11:15.054
Just wishing each other luck.

11:15.056 --> 11:16.388
Mom!

11:17.118 --> 11:19.224
Nick.

11:20.694 --> 11:23.228
Mom. What are you doing here?

11:23.230 --> 11:25.330
Sorry. Dr. Bull,

11:25.332 --> 11:27.466
this is my mom.

11:27.468 --> 11:29.535
And this is my son, Nicholas.

11:29.537 --> 11:31.336
So, is it Nicholas,

11:31.338 --> 11:34.006
Nicky, Nick, or... Dude?

11:34.008 --> 11:35.874
Nick.

11:37.278 --> 11:39.478
But I kind of like Dude.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.413
Then Dude it shall be.

11:41.415 --> 11:43.482
And you can call me Dr. Bull.

11:44.019 --> 11:46.485
I think we had aa good day.

11:46.487 --> 11:47.920
Great day.

11:47.922 --> 11:49.955
More great days to come.

11:49.957 --> 11:52.424
Okay. Then we should get out of here...

11:52.426 --> 11:54.560
Yeah... while the getting's good.

11:57.465 --> 11:59.798
How sick do you think he is?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.066
Well...

12:01.068 --> 12:03.535
they were praying for him at church.

12:03.537 --> 12:04.803
Excuse me?

12:04.805 --> 12:06.171
Yeah.

12:06.173 --> 12:08.240
Priest said a prayer for him during Mass.

12:08.242 --> 12:10.375
I mean, it... flew right past me,

12:10.377 --> 12:12.611
but.. he said it was leukemia.

12:12.613 --> 12:14.613
Of course.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.950
That's how she found out
about the CBD oil:

12:17.952 --> 12:19.618
Her son's cancer.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.290
Yeah, but why wouldn't she
be honest about that?

12:22.291 --> 12:24.291
Well, I'm guessing she
didn't want us to know

12:24.293 --> 12:27.394
she's using CBD oil on a minor.

12:34.919 --> 12:37.142
As a Doctor of Pharmacology

12:37.167 --> 12:39.868
at the largest teaching
hospital on the East Coast,

12:39.870 --> 12:42.074
what is your opinion

12:42.076 --> 12:45.473
on CBD oil as a treatment option?

12:45.915 --> 12:48.754
At this time, the federal
government classifies it

12:48.756 --> 12:50.774
as a Schedule I drug,

12:50.776 --> 12:53.448
which means it has
no medical benefit whatsoever.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.950
I think that says it all.

12:54.952 --> 12:56.518
So I am curious.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.520
Based on your medical expertise,

12:58.522 --> 13:01.990
would you recommend
CBD oil as a treatment

13:01.992 --> 13:04.363
- for MS?
- No.

13:04.365 --> 13:07.170
- What about Parkinson's disease?
- No.

13:07.172 --> 13:10.966
And would you recommend
it as a treatment for...

13:10.968 --> 13:14.069
an adult suffering from leukemia?

13:14.071 --> 13:15.370
No, I would not.

13:15.372 --> 13:18.873
And based on your medical expertise,

13:18.875 --> 13:21.762
how would you characterize the choice

13:21.764 --> 13:24.702
to treat a child's leukemia

13:24.704 --> 13:26.748
with CBD oil?

13:26.750 --> 13:30.585
I would characterize it as reckless...

13:30.788 --> 13:33.989
unsound, unsafe, dangerous...

13:34.402 --> 13:35.958
and, while I'm not a lawyer,

13:35.960 --> 13:38.827
I would venture to say
almost certainly criminal.

13:38.829 --> 13:40.162
Objection, Your Honor.

13:40.164 --> 13:42.731
The man is guessing.
And he's not a lawyer.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.934
His opinion as to the criminality

13:44.936 --> 13:48.304
of this hypothetical example
is just that, an opinion.

13:48.306 --> 13:51.774
Objection sustained. Jury will
disregard Dr. Yates's opinion

13:51.776 --> 13:54.376
with regard to criminality.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.245
But they won't, will they?

13:56.247 --> 13:57.780
Not a chance.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.181
I have no more questions,

13:59.183 --> 14:01.083
- Your Honor.
- We'll resume

14:01.085 --> 14:02.918
hearing testimony tomorrow.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.954
This court is adjourned.

14:06.424 --> 14:07.623
How red is it over there?

14:07.625 --> 14:09.158
You know the Red Sea?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.160
You know that reindeer Rudolph's nose?

14:11.162 --> 14:13.696
You know when they roll out
the red carpet?

14:14.565 --> 14:16.098
I'm not following you.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.780
Yeah, it's red.
You're a little slow today.

14:20.438 --> 14:22.638
So, what are you doing after court?

14:22.640 --> 14:24.640
We need to have an honest conversation.

14:24.642 --> 14:26.942
<i>You can see where the other side's going.</i>

14:26.944 --> 14:28.944
They're getting ready
to use your son against you

14:28.946 --> 14:30.112
like a baseball bat.

14:30.114 --> 14:32.147
The fact that he has leukemia.

14:32.149 --> 14:34.016
The fact that you're
treating him with CBD oil.

14:34.018 --> 14:35.317
That's what's going on, isn't it?

14:35.319 --> 14:37.240
You're saying that as
if it's a bad thing.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.506
Well, that is, according
to their expert today...

14:39.508 --> 14:42.825
Please. That supposed expert was wrong.

14:42.827 --> 14:45.027
The oil has been
a huge help with every...

14:45.029 --> 14:46.629
It doesn't matter whether
he's wrong about that.

14:46.631 --> 14:47.796
What he's right about,

14:47.798 --> 14:50.599
or at least will be
as far as the jury's concerned,

14:50.601 --> 14:54.336
is that when you're giving
this oil to your adult patients,

14:54.338 --> 14:56.439
they are capable of making a decision

14:56.441 --> 14:57.873
about whether or not
they want to take it.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.475
But when you're giving it to a child...

14:59.477 --> 15:01.310
<i>My</i> child.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.096
My child.

15:06.389 --> 15:08.417
I'm not a monster.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.819
I know.

15:10.821 --> 15:13.989
And that is why you're here... today.

15:15.893 --> 15:17.567
We're here to arm you.

15:18.401 --> 15:21.430
The defense calls Dr. Laura Allen.

15:24.535 --> 15:28.037
My son was diagnosed
with leukemia two years ago.

15:28.039 --> 15:30.455
He immediately started chemotherapy.

15:31.215 --> 15:33.315
At first the side effects were tolerable.

15:33.511 --> 15:37.946
A little nausea, some vomiting
once or twice a week.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.750
Then it was every day.

15:41.752 --> 15:45.721
And then it was every day,
three, four times a day.

15:46.557 --> 15:49.591
He lost 20 pounds that first month.

15:50.391 --> 15:52.561
We tried everything
to alleviate his misery,

15:52.563 --> 15:54.430
but nothing worked.

15:54.719 --> 15:56.852
He was so weak.

15:57.735 --> 15:59.301
If he could...

16:00.109 --> 16:02.571
if he could get out of bed
and make it to the bathroom,

16:02.573 --> 16:04.206
it was a good day.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.407
And there were not a lot of good days.

16:08.546 --> 16:11.579
Then I walked into his room
one night to check on him,

16:11.581 --> 16:13.482
and he was sitting on his bed,

16:13.484 --> 16:16.125
holding a plastic bag over his head.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.022
I don't know where he got the idea...

16:20.024 --> 16:23.659
he still won't tell me... but I
knew what he was trying to do.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.996
I stopped the chemo the next day.

16:30.634 --> 16:32.668
But... I'm a doctor,

16:32.670 --> 16:35.270
and I knew stopping the
chemo wasn't the answer.

16:35.272 --> 16:38.398
We were gonna have to resume the
treatment again at some point.

16:39.774 --> 16:42.311
I honestly didn't know what to do.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.947
Then I read about CBD oil.

16:44.949 --> 16:46.682
So I drove to New York,

16:46.684 --> 16:48.684
wrote myself a bogus prescription,

16:48.686 --> 16:50.619
and I bought one vial.

16:50.621 --> 16:53.155
I gave Nicholas one dropperful,

16:53.157 --> 16:56.191
and within two hours,
he stopped throwing up.

16:56.707 --> 16:58.660
Over the course of the next two weeks,

16:58.662 --> 17:02.598
he put on five pounds,
and he was up and out of bed.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.007
He even had some friends over to play.

17:05.368 --> 17:07.770
My baby was living his life again

17:07.771 --> 17:10.262
instead of just waiting to die.

17:12.910 --> 17:15.911
So why not... move to New York

17:15.913 --> 17:18.280
or another state where it's legal?

17:18.281 --> 17:20.482
I thought about that.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.654
But after seeing how much
CBD oil helped my son,

17:25.656 --> 17:29.892
it occurred to me it might
also help some of my patients.

17:29.894 --> 17:32.910
And how do you abandon
people at that point?

17:33.364 --> 17:36.899
You show them something
that works, and then...

17:36.901 --> 17:38.867
you just leave?

17:38.869 --> 17:40.334
You just...

17:41.627 --> 17:43.671
you just take it away from them?

17:47.079 --> 17:50.404
I know we brought her here
to prepare her to testify...

17:50.406 --> 17:55.050
but I don't know how you
improve on what she just did.

18:04.428 --> 18:08.330
I know you were hoping to avoid
telling this part of the story.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.866
And I know...

18:10.868 --> 18:13.202
it feels private and personal,

18:13.204 --> 18:16.412
and it half belongs to your son,
but I need you...

18:17.074 --> 18:19.290
to make your peace with it...

18:20.211 --> 18:24.003
because when it comes time
to defend you...

18:25.254 --> 18:27.924
it may be the only option we have.

18:35.860 --> 18:38.392
Think Nick'll still be up
when you get home?

18:38.996 --> 18:40.895
I hope so.

18:43.439 --> 18:44.766
Thanks for the ride.

18:44.768 --> 18:46.768
You're on my way.

18:46.770 --> 18:48.670
No, I'm not.

18:48.672 --> 18:50.706
Benny told me where you live.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.156
You live downtown.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.743
They have bars where you live?

18:54.745 --> 18:57.880
- Of course.
- Then you're on my way.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.999
Does somebody have a problem?

19:02.486 --> 19:04.168
With what?

19:04.488 --> 19:06.088
Drinking?

19:06.090 --> 19:07.672
Nah, I drink fine.

19:10.925 --> 19:12.394
I'll make you a deal.

19:12.927 --> 19:15.497
Come in the house with me,
say hi to my mom...

19:15.499 --> 19:17.599
and Nick, if he's up...

19:18.015 --> 19:20.102
and I'll make both of us a drink.

19:20.685 --> 19:23.105
Though I'm not sure what
kind of liquor my mom has.

19:23.107 --> 19:24.973
Why would you do that?

19:24.975 --> 19:26.909
'Cause I want to keep an eye on you.

19:26.911 --> 19:30.736
I need you in court tomorrow,
preferably not hungover.

19:35.005 --> 19:37.138
Hi, Mom! Nick!

19:37.354 --> 19:39.035
Mom, it's the middle of winter.

19:39.037 --> 19:40.756
I don't know what to tell you.

19:40.758 --> 19:43.392
First he's cold, then he's hot,
then he's cold, then he's hot.

19:43.394 --> 19:44.993
Get over here.

19:44.995 --> 19:46.395
Come here.

19:46.397 --> 19:48.530
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

19:48.532 --> 19:50.265
Yeah, well, you were the one
sitting around in your underwear

19:50.267 --> 19:52.801
like some kind of a nudist,
and I'm embarrassing you?

19:52.803 --> 19:54.303
Maybe I should come back another time.

19:54.305 --> 19:55.771
No. No.

20:07.952 --> 20:10.089
- Can I help you?
- Dr. Laura Allen?

20:10.091 --> 20:12.187
I'm with New York City
Children's Services,

20:12.189 --> 20:14.456
and we have an order
to remove Nicholas Allen

20:14.458 --> 20:15.757
from this residence.

20:15.759 --> 20:18.527
Remove Nicholas?
What are you talking about?

20:19.328 --> 20:22.531
They're taking him over to
Sacred Heart Hospital for observation.

20:22.533 --> 20:24.569
Put him under a 24hour hold.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.854
Mom? What's going on?

20:26.856 --> 20:28.099
Stay where you are.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.772
- No one's taking my son anywhere.
- So, who called you?

20:30.774 --> 20:32.674
Obviously, someone filed a complaint.

20:32.676 --> 20:34.209
I'm sorry.
I'm forbidden by law to tell you

20:34.211 --> 20:35.859
- who initiated this action.
- It wouldn't happen

20:35.861 --> 20:38.013
to be the assistant United
States attorney, would it?

20:38.782 --> 20:40.248
Fine. No names.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.050
I'm part of Dr. Allen's legal team.

20:42.052 --> 20:45.809
Can you tell me what this
anonymous source alleges?

20:45.811 --> 20:48.056
All I know is that a minor
named Nicholas Allen

20:48.058 --> 20:50.048
is supposedly being denied
proper medical care

20:50.050 --> 20:51.660
and that his life is in imminent danger

20:51.662 --> 20:53.261
and illegal drugs are involved.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.307
This is a nightmare.

20:55.332 --> 20:56.665
I'm sorry, but I need
you to surrender him

20:56.667 --> 20:58.233
to this officer, ma'am.

20:58.235 --> 20:59.534
No.

20:59.536 --> 21:01.531
Laura, we don't have a choice.

21:01.533 --> 21:04.335
You better knock me down.
You better mace me.

21:04.337 --> 21:06.701
You better take me to prison,
because that's the only way

21:06.703 --> 21:08.610
- you're getting to my little boy.
- No! Mom!

21:08.612 --> 21:09.878
Don't let them take me!

21:09.880 --> 21:11.747
It's okay. Okay, I'm calling for backup.

21:11.749 --> 21:13.782
Don't do that. Wait a second.

21:13.784 --> 21:15.341
Listen.

21:16.353 --> 21:19.921
We will take him in my car.
We're taking him.

21:19.923 --> 21:21.657
You can follow us or we'll follow you.

21:21.659 --> 21:23.058
But we're taking him.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.927
His mother and I are
taking him to the hospital.

21:25.929 --> 21:27.696
Right, Dr. Allen?

21:27.698 --> 21:29.164
That's what you want, right?

21:29.166 --> 21:30.699
You want him to go to the hospital?

21:30.701 --> 21:34.002
Nowhere on this paper does
it say we can't take him there

21:34.004 --> 21:36.338
and you can't stay with him there.

21:40.444 --> 21:43.145
Mom, pack Nicky a bag.

21:54.097 --> 21:57.465
Dr. Allen, it's almost 11:00 at night

21:57.467 --> 21:59.333
and we both need to be in court tomorrow.

22:02.138 --> 22:04.223
I know you want to be near your son.

22:04.807 --> 22:09.110
But... they're never
gonna let that happen,

22:09.112 --> 22:12.947
not for at least another 22 hours.

22:14.784 --> 22:16.717
What do you say we get out of here?

22:17.132 --> 22:19.780
You can go. I'm just gonna sit here.

22:27.329 --> 22:29.563
You want me to get someone from my office

22:29.565 --> 22:31.091
to come and sit with you?

22:31.964 --> 22:33.501
I don't want you sitting alone.

22:33.503 --> 22:37.004
I asked the doctor
what if he sees something,

22:37.006 --> 22:39.039
something he doesn't agree with,

22:39.041 --> 22:40.508
something that, in his mind,

22:40.510 --> 22:43.210
indicates that Nick's not
getting the care that he needs?

22:43.212 --> 22:44.847
What happens then?

22:45.313 --> 22:46.539
And?

22:49.252 --> 22:52.653
And he said they'd probably
put him in foster care.

22:52.655 --> 22:55.122
You know I wouldn't let that happen,

22:55.124 --> 22:56.957
at least not without a fight.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.865
I'm on trial for trying to make
my dying son feel better.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.803
How screwed up is that?

23:06.805 --> 23:08.303
So do I believe that if they want

23:08.305 --> 23:10.604
to take my son away from me, they will?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.291
You're damn right I do.

23:19.882 --> 23:22.931
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being difficult.

23:22.933 --> 23:24.785
I'm sorry for being dramatic.

23:24.787 --> 23:26.387
You can go.

23:26.389 --> 23:27.988
I'll be fine.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.323
I'll see you in the morning.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.258
I'm happy to call someone.

23:31.260 --> 23:34.563
No. I want to be alone...

23:35.331 --> 23:37.066
with him...

23:38.067 --> 23:40.236
or at least near him.

23:42.071 --> 23:44.205
15, 20 more minutes,
I'll be leaving, too.

23:44.207 --> 23:45.606
Honestly.

23:47.376 --> 23:50.477
Will you call me or text me
when you get home?

23:51.205 --> 23:52.846
No.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.291
I'm a grownup.

23:55.818 --> 23:57.518
I'll see you in the morning.

24:21.444 --> 24:22.743
Your Honor.

24:22.745 --> 24:25.879
We have been sitting here and waiting

24:25.881 --> 24:28.182
for almost an hour and 15 minutes.

24:28.184 --> 24:30.384
Do we know if the defendant is planning

24:30.386 --> 24:32.720
on deigning us with her presence or not?

24:32.722 --> 24:34.989
Gentlemen, what do we know?

24:34.991 --> 24:38.794
Your Honor, she is on her way.

24:39.528 --> 24:42.029
Please tell me she's on her way.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.440
Where the hell are you?

24:53.442 --> 24:55.276
Nicholas is gone.

24:55.278 --> 24:56.477
What?

24:56.479 --> 24:57.978
He ran away.

24:57.980 --> 24:59.913
I came to the hospital to try to see him

24:59.915 --> 25:02.182
before court this morning and
when I got here, he was gone.

25:02.184 --> 25:03.884
No one even knew he was missing.

25:03.886 --> 25:06.487
I'm in my car. I'ml'm looking for him.

25:06.489 --> 25:07.855
Laura, I need you to listen to me.

25:07.857 --> 25:09.657
I'll get my team to find Nicholas, okay?

25:09.659 --> 25:12.726
What I need you to do right now
is come to court and testify.

25:13.537 --> 25:15.095
Laura?

25:15.097 --> 25:16.997
Laura.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.002
Counselor, it's time to move on.

25:22.004 --> 25:23.971
Your Honor, I just got off the phone

25:23.973 --> 25:26.106
with Dr. Allen. Turns
out her son is missing

25:26.108 --> 25:27.059
from the hospital.

25:27.061 --> 25:28.601
She's out looking for him.
If we could just take...

25:28.603 --> 25:30.661
No, we can't "just."

25:30.662 --> 25:33.797
You and your client have
exhausted this court's patience.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.246
I'm issuing a warrant
for Dr. Allen's arrest.

25:36.248 --> 25:37.667
Call a witness, any witness

25:37.669 --> 25:39.569
and stretch out their testimony
as long as you can.

25:39.571 --> 25:40.998
I'll be back.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.739
Yeah?

25:50.115 --> 25:52.082
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.385
I heard them talking about chemo
last night and it scared me.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.751
So I waited till the sun
came up, put on my clothes

25:57.753 --> 25:59.084
and just walked out.

25:59.086 --> 26:01.992
I thought I could make it
to the courthouse to find Mom,

26:01.994 --> 26:03.526
but I got so tired.

26:03.528 --> 26:05.762
I picked him up at a park nearby.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.797
This nice lady let me use her phone.

26:07.799 --> 26:10.245
Sorry to interrupt.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.343
We haven't met. You the dad?

26:12.345 --> 26:14.638
Um, Dr. Jason Bull.
I'm part of the legal team.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.725
Forgive me. Dr. Kulkarni.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.610
Want the good news
or you want the good news?

26:21.713 --> 26:23.680
After a full evaluation,
I'm in complete support

26:23.682 --> 26:27.425
of your treatment regimen,
including the CBD oil.

26:27.427 --> 26:30.186
- That's great.
- Yeah. Honestly, I...

26:30.188 --> 26:33.490
I couldn't have advised a better
treatment plan than yours.

26:33.492 --> 26:36.087
I do want Nicholas to stay
with us one more night, though.

26:36.089 --> 26:37.560
That little trip to the park

26:37.562 --> 26:38.862
dehydrated you just a little bit.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.497
Want to give him some fluids.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.165
What about Child Services?

26:42.167 --> 26:44.701
I'll have my report in the next hour.

26:44.703 --> 26:48.371
My guess is that Nicholas will be
able to go home with you tomorrow.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.809
Thank you, Doctor.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.383
Thank you, Doctor.

26:54.385 --> 26:57.513
Anybody have any questions,
I'll be around.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.884
Forgive me, Doctor.

27:01.886 --> 27:06.522
If I needed you
to testify about the efficacy

27:06.524 --> 27:08.257
of Dr. Allen's treatment,
would you be willing?

27:08.259 --> 27:10.460
Of course. Schedule permitting.

27:10.988 --> 27:12.862
Thank you.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.834
We have to handle one other thing.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.469
What's that?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.604
There is a warrant out for your arrest.

27:21.606 --> 27:24.373
<i>She felt she had no choice
but to go and find</i>

27:24.375 --> 27:25.975
her son since the people
who were supposed

27:25.977 --> 27:28.544
to be responsible for him
clearly weren't up to the task.

27:28.546 --> 27:29.912
How can you fault a parent

27:29.914 --> 27:31.547
convinced that her son was in danger

27:31.549 --> 27:34.250
for doing what any parent
would do in this situation?

27:34.252 --> 27:38.120
Dr. Bull, your client
is charged with a serious crime

27:38.122 --> 27:41.457
that could see her spend
20 years in a federal prison.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.359
She was out on bail

27:43.361 --> 27:45.394
and due in court this morning.

27:45.396 --> 27:47.630
Neither she nor you made any effort

27:47.632 --> 27:48.965
to communicate with this court

27:48.967 --> 27:51.400
in any way to seek its permission

27:51.402 --> 27:53.769
to search for her son.

27:54.615 --> 27:56.639
I'm revoking your bail.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.074
And remanding you

27:58.076 --> 28:00.543
to the jail here in
the federal courthouse

28:00.545 --> 28:01.811
until the completion

28:01.813 --> 28:03.464
- of your hearing.
- But Your Honor...

28:03.466 --> 28:05.672
Your Honor, my son's in the hospital.
He's waiting for me.

28:05.674 --> 28:08.017
Well, someone will just
have to explain to him

28:08.019 --> 28:10.186
what happens when people flaunt the law.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.424
See you in court tomorrow morning.

28:31.112 --> 28:33.579
8:00 a.m., everybody's
here just as you asked.

28:33.581 --> 28:36.048
Car downstairs to take
Benny and me to court?

28:36.050 --> 28:37.350
Last I checked.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.819
Let's do this.

28:39.821 --> 28:41.621
Marissa,

28:41.623 --> 28:43.923
where are we with the mirror jurors?

28:44.581 --> 28:47.334
Three green and nine red.

28:48.429 --> 28:50.263
Okay. Chunk.

28:50.265 --> 28:53.766
I need you to prep Dr. Kulkarni. Okay?

28:53.768 --> 28:56.903
Now, he's due to go on the stand
later this afternoon

28:56.905 --> 28:59.605
and he is a busy guy and he
is gonna resist this notion,

28:59.607 --> 29:01.747
but go to the hospital if you have to.

29:01.749 --> 29:04.510
Do it in the hall between
surgeries. I don't care.

29:04.512 --> 29:07.217
It's a tall order, but I'm a tall man.

29:07.219 --> 29:08.772
Yes, you are.

29:09.651 --> 29:10.983
Danny.

29:10.985 --> 29:12.618
Let's try and round up as many

29:12.620 --> 29:14.108
of Laura's 27 patients as we can.

29:14.110 --> 29:16.255
Get them into Manhattan
and I want you to march them

29:16.257 --> 29:18.424
into that courtroom and
force that judge, that jury

29:18.426 --> 29:20.560
and even that tightass
federal prosecutor

29:20.562 --> 29:23.347
to see whose quality of life
it is they are monkeying with.

29:23.349 --> 29:25.080
I'll do the best I can.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.801
Cable.

29:29.496 --> 29:32.972
I need you to really
drill down on that jury,

29:32.974 --> 29:34.874
just check for any sweet spots
we might've missed

29:34.876 --> 29:37.109
because everybody gets sick.

29:37.111 --> 29:40.646
Everybody has a doctor
and there has got to be a way

29:40.648 --> 29:42.849
to reach these people
we're not tapping into.

29:42.851 --> 29:43.983
I'm on it.

29:43.985 --> 29:45.909
<i>Dr. Kulkarni,</i>

29:46.418 --> 29:50.319
how long have you been
a boardcertified oncologist?

29:50.321 --> 29:51.552
17 years.

29:51.554 --> 29:53.263
And at the behest

29:53.265 --> 29:55.661
of the City of New York's
Child Services Bureau,

29:55.663 --> 29:59.031
you have thoroughly examined
Dr. Allen's son, Nicholas.

29:59.033 --> 30:00.041
I have.

30:00.043 --> 30:01.567
And how would you characterize

30:01.569 --> 30:03.002
the level of care he's been receiving?

30:03.004 --> 30:04.604
Outstanding.

30:04.606 --> 30:06.706
Even though that care has included

30:06.708 --> 30:08.341
the administration of CBD oil?

30:08.343 --> 30:09.809
Yes, absolutely.

30:09.811 --> 30:11.815
Isn't it true that doctors,

30:11.817 --> 30:15.076
real dedicated doctors, are often torn

30:15.078 --> 30:19.764
between doing what's required
and doing what they know

30:19.766 --> 30:21.687
to be the best thing for their patients?

30:21.689 --> 30:25.691
Like, the insurance will say
a doctor can only do "X"

30:25.693 --> 30:29.362
when he or she knows that they
really need to do "Y," too.

30:29.364 --> 30:30.796
Objection.

30:30.798 --> 30:33.380
The defense is asking the
witness to speculate.

30:33.405 --> 30:34.901
Sustained.

30:34.903 --> 30:36.565
Okay. Letlet me ask this
differently, Your Honor.

30:36.567 --> 30:39.305
II'd like to try
and be of some help here.

30:39.307 --> 30:42.875
Maymay I tell you about
something that happened to me?

30:43.742 --> 30:45.044
Your Honor?

30:45.046 --> 30:46.379
Nice move.

30:46.381 --> 30:48.450
Chunk, you really prepped this guy.

30:48.452 --> 30:51.384
You ain't seen nothing yet.

30:52.453 --> 30:54.553
When I was 20 years old,

30:54.555 --> 30:58.157
my mother fell sick
with esophageal cancer.

30:58.159 --> 31:02.428
It's a particularly painful
cancer of the throat.

31:02.430 --> 31:05.464
For several months, she was
in and out of the hospital.

31:05.466 --> 31:08.668
And finally, they sent her home

31:08.670 --> 31:11.470
because there just wasn't
anything for them to do for her.

31:11.472 --> 31:13.673
This was before med school.

31:13.675 --> 31:16.208
I was going to local colleges,
living at home.

31:16.210 --> 31:21.781
And at night, I'd sit in my room
and I'd hear my mother

31:22.447 --> 31:25.351
either labor for breath

31:25.353 --> 31:27.386
or moan in pain.

31:27.388 --> 31:31.223
I mentioned this to a friend
of mine at school

31:31.225 --> 31:33.726
and as it turned out,
her dad was a doctor.

31:33.728 --> 31:38.088
So, came, saw my mother,
spent some time with her

31:38.633 --> 31:42.759
and he told me he was gonna
give her something for the pain.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.762
That something turned out to be morphine.

31:46.174 --> 31:47.606
It's a tricky drug.

31:47.608 --> 31:49.008
Given in the right amount,

31:49.010 --> 31:52.019
it can do amazing things, but, um...

31:52.914 --> 31:55.731
give too much and the patient dies.

31:56.918 --> 31:59.418
In my mother's case, it did just
what it was supposed to do.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.787
The moaning stopped.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.991
The labored breath became
less and less pronounced.

32:04.993 --> 32:06.790
She slept a lot,

32:06.792 --> 32:09.411
but always with a smile on her face.

32:09.413 --> 32:11.630
For the first time in two years,

32:11.632 --> 32:14.916
she was experiencing something
like peace.

32:15.937 --> 32:20.706
Two days later, I walked into her room

32:20.708 --> 32:22.674
to tell her I was going to school.

32:24.012 --> 32:25.945
She wasn't breathing.

32:25.947 --> 32:29.264
She had died during the night.

32:29.951 --> 32:31.725
Her pain gone.

32:34.235 --> 32:37.236
The smile still there.

32:37.392 --> 32:40.593
Now... was the doctor

32:40.595 --> 32:42.194
at fault?

32:42.730 --> 32:44.997
Did he give her too much morphine?

32:44.999 --> 32:46.665
We'll never know.

32:46.667 --> 32:49.201
But I think he gave her what she needed:

32:49.701 --> 32:51.137
Mercy.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.139
No one talks about it,

32:53.141 --> 32:55.141
but doctors face these choices

32:55.143 --> 32:56.642
every day.

32:56.644 --> 32:59.260
But if they truly care
about their patients...

32:59.262 --> 33:00.746
Objection.

33:00.748 --> 33:02.014
Overruled.

33:02.631 --> 33:04.083
We have seven,

33:04.085 --> 33:05.017
she has five.

33:05.019 --> 33:06.318
<i>Dr. Kulkarni,</i>

33:06.320 --> 33:09.755
you actually prescribe the same CBD oil

33:09.757 --> 33:12.525
to some of your patients
as Dr. Allen does, don't you?

33:12.527 --> 33:14.827
- I do.
- So let me ask you something.

33:14.829 --> 33:17.196
Hypothetically speaking,
how far would you go

33:17.198 --> 33:20.032
if you lived in a state
where your ill patients

33:20.034 --> 33:22.268
couldn't get the CBD oil they needed

33:22.270 --> 33:24.203
to relieve their suffering?

33:24.205 --> 33:26.772
That <i> you</i> needed to relieve
your child's suffering?

33:26.774 --> 33:29.008
I would hope that
I would have the courage

33:29.010 --> 33:30.676
to go to hell and back.

33:30.678 --> 33:32.545
Just as Dr. Allen did.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.116
For those of you keeping score,

33:37.118 --> 33:40.219
we are staring
at eight green and four red.

33:40.221 --> 33:42.594
And how far away are our surprise guests?

33:42.596 --> 33:45.224
They should be coming through
the door any second now.

33:50.798 --> 33:54.433
I, apologize for
the disruption, Your Honor.

33:54.435 --> 33:56.402
But these are 13

33:56.404 --> 33:59.638
of the 27 patients that Dr. Allen

33:59.640 --> 34:02.575
has been treating with the CBD oil.

34:02.577 --> 34:04.643
They...

34:04.645 --> 34:06.879
came into the city today,

34:06.881 --> 34:09.882
at a moment's notice, in
hopes that we could put them

34:09.884 --> 34:11.545
on the witness list,

34:11.547 --> 34:13.786
and allow them to tell the jury

34:13.788 --> 34:16.655
how Dr. Allen has done

34:16.657 --> 34:20.426
nothing but make their
treatments more bearable

34:20.428 --> 34:22.331
and their lives more livable.

34:22.333 --> 34:25.364
Objection! Your Honor, this is the first

34:25.366 --> 34:28.634
that the prosecution has heard
about these witnesses.

34:28.636 --> 34:30.603
I would like to request a recess

34:30.605 --> 34:32.138
for the day...

34:32.139 --> 34:34.806
so that I could possibly vet the list.

34:34.809 --> 34:36.775
- Someone's getting nervous.
- Your Honor,

34:36.777 --> 34:38.878
I can't guarantee
I can get all these people back

34:38.880 --> 34:40.810
- if we recess today.
- I love a good fight.

34:40.812 --> 34:44.683
If counsel for both sides
will approach the bench.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.520
This is good.

34:47.522 --> 34:49.404
This is good for us.

34:50.056 --> 34:53.049
Yeah.

34:54.409 --> 34:57.047
The witness is dismissed.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.931
This court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

35:02.403 --> 35:04.336
I'll catch up with both of you later.

35:04.338 --> 35:06.539
There's something I have to do.

35:11.045 --> 35:14.046
Of all the gin joints in all the world...

35:14.048 --> 35:16.015
within three blocks of the courthouse...

35:16.017 --> 35:17.783
I walk into yours.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.587
Hey. I like the color of her drink.

35:21.589 --> 35:23.104
I'll have one of those.

35:25.346 --> 35:27.626
I think you and I have
something to talk about.

35:27.628 --> 35:29.361
Really?

35:29.864 --> 35:31.597
You into women's volleyball?

35:33.601 --> 35:36.220
The jury's swinging my way; You know it,

35:36.245 --> 35:37.811
and I know it.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.070
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

35:40.095 --> 35:42.095
Humor me for a second.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.321
'Cause if I'm right... and this
is what I do for a living...

35:45.832 --> 35:47.680
the game is pretty much over.

35:47.682 --> 35:50.382
I mean, maybe you
squeak by with a mistrial,

35:50.384 --> 35:52.718
but is that really
a risk you want to take?

35:54.288 --> 35:56.255
- What?
- I'ml'm just trying

35:56.257 --> 35:58.090
to figure out how you got that...

35:58.092 --> 36:00.626
gigantic head of yours
through that teenytiny door.

36:02.096 --> 36:04.797
Wow. She smiles,

36:04.799 --> 36:07.066
she jokes.

36:07.068 --> 36:09.201
She's full of surprises.

36:09.203 --> 36:11.370
So, how about this?

36:11.372 --> 36:13.505
You reduce the charges
to straight possession,

36:13.507 --> 36:16.008
my client will plead
guilty to a misdemeanor

36:16.010 --> 36:18.744
and do... four years probation.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.614
She still has a fighting chance
of keeping her medical license,

36:21.616 --> 36:23.649
and you get the conviction you want,

36:23.651 --> 36:25.784
and everybody wins.

36:26.293 --> 36:28.153
No.

36:28.155 --> 36:29.788
No?

36:29.790 --> 36:31.090
No.

36:32.026 --> 36:34.360
Even though you're not gonna win?

36:34.362 --> 36:37.363
Even though I <i> may</i> not win.

36:42.637 --> 36:44.236
So, what's your end game here?

36:44.238 --> 36:46.171
You get a kick
out of tearing families apart?

36:46.173 --> 36:48.140
I know it was you
who called Child Services.

36:48.142 --> 36:50.676
I never tried to hide that.

36:51.196 --> 36:52.811
You ever had a child?

36:56.550 --> 36:58.817
Are we... are we going there?

36:59.639 --> 37:01.840
I'vel've never had a child, so...

37:02.023 --> 37:04.056
I would never be able to understand

37:04.058 --> 37:06.158
what your client is going through?

37:06.160 --> 37:09.261
That is simpleminded.

37:09.263 --> 37:10.896
Even for you.

37:11.379 --> 37:13.866
And whatwhat about you?
How many children

37:13.868 --> 37:15.334
do you have, Dr. Bull?

37:15.336 --> 37:17.836
Only a man with a name like "Bull"

37:17.838 --> 37:21.707
could equate fertility with empathy.

37:26.514 --> 37:29.615
One... but just for an inkling. A second.

37:32.019 --> 37:35.220
My exwife had a miscarriage.

37:38.259 --> 37:39.658
You're right.

37:39.660 --> 37:42.394
I withdraw the question. Forgive me.

37:44.465 --> 37:45.864
Look...

37:45.866 --> 37:49.835
it is my job to help the courts
adjudicate these cases.

37:49.837 --> 37:53.305
And once they do, the system takes over.

37:53.307 --> 37:55.074
It's very simple.

37:55.076 --> 37:57.242
It's not personal, Dr. Bull.

37:57.244 --> 37:58.544
It's my job.

37:58.546 --> 37:59.745
It's just my job.

38:00.512 --> 38:01.613
Your job.

38:01.615 --> 38:03.148
Not your agenda?

38:03.150 --> 38:05.284
You think I have an agenda?

38:05.286 --> 38:07.753
Well, why else would you choose
to take the case?

38:07.755 --> 38:09.755
I chose this case because nobody else

38:09.757 --> 38:11.323
in my department would take it.

38:11.325 --> 38:13.692
They all sympathize with your client.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.195
Truth is, so do I.

38:17.998 --> 38:19.698
But...

38:19.700 --> 38:21.667
just like her, I took an oath,

38:21.669 --> 38:24.703
and just like her, I have
a professional responsibility.

38:24.705 --> 38:27.306
Mine is to uphold the law.

38:29.810 --> 38:32.878
And when your beliefs
don't align with the law?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.045
Look...

38:34.682 --> 38:37.082
the reality is...

38:37.084 --> 38:39.885
our beliefs don't matter...

38:39.887 --> 38:41.920
because it's not up to us

38:41.922 --> 38:44.639
to decide what happens to Dr. Allen.

38:45.259 --> 38:46.959
I do my job.

38:46.961 --> 38:48.810
You do your job.

38:50.431 --> 38:53.399
The system does the rest.

39:04.245 --> 39:05.911
So, what did she say?

39:05.913 --> 39:07.613
She doesn't want to play.

39:09.038 --> 39:11.083
Is there any good news?

39:11.085 --> 39:13.285
Well, we do have eight jurors
on our side...

39:13.287 --> 39:16.155
we just need to move those other four.

39:16.157 --> 39:17.523
Well, it's gonna be tough.

39:17.525 --> 39:20.292
I did some focus group work
with them tonight,

39:20.294 --> 39:22.261
and they're having
a really difficult time

39:22.263 --> 39:24.997
reconciling the fact that while
they sympathize with Laura,

39:24.999 --> 39:27.433
she knowingly broke the law.

39:30.137 --> 39:33.305
Then our job is to reconcile
those feelings for them.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.442
We need to empower them,
we need to tell them that...

39:36.444 --> 39:39.178
in so many words,
their feelings about this case

39:39.180 --> 39:42.548
matter <i> more</i> than the law.

39:42.550 --> 39:45.117
- That each and...
<i>- That each and...</i>

39:45.119 --> 39:46.652
<i>- every one of you...</i>
- every one of you

39:46.654 --> 39:48.220
sitting here in front of me,

39:48.222 --> 39:50.422
your opinion matters.

39:52.359 --> 39:54.693
Your opinion matters.

39:54.695 --> 39:56.795
Your opinion matters,

39:56.797 --> 39:58.964
your opinion matters,

39:58.966 --> 40:00.799
and your opinion matters.

40:01.841 --> 40:03.869
Now, II can tell you my opinion.

40:03.871 --> 40:06.672
I believe Ms. Allen did the right thing.

40:07.508 --> 40:10.542
She did the most... responsible,

40:10.544 --> 40:12.511
loving and kind thing

40:12.513 --> 40:15.080
for her patients
and for her son. I mean...

40:15.082 --> 40:16.448
think about it.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.817
How could she have done any less?

40:19.987 --> 40:22.403
But... you know what?

40:23.824 --> 40:25.865
My opinion doesn't matter.

40:26.741 --> 40:29.283
For that matter,
the prosecution's opinion

40:29.285 --> 40:30.912
doesn't matter.

40:31.913 --> 40:35.100
Now, the prosecution would like
for you to think otherwise.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.503
The prosecution would like
for you to <i> think</i>

40:37.505 --> 40:39.972
that your opinion doesn't matter at all.

40:39.974 --> 40:43.308
That the law is the law, and
everything else is irrelevant.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.576
But, you know,

40:44.578 --> 40:47.045
let's talk about the law for a second.

40:47.047 --> 40:50.215
You know, it's different in
New York than it is in Virginia.

40:50.217 --> 40:52.751
And according to the federal government,

40:52.753 --> 40:55.387
the law in New York and 41 other states

40:55.389 --> 40:58.439
is in violation of the law of the land.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.193
So what <i> is</i> the law of the land

41:01.195 --> 41:03.529
if the states can't agree with it?

41:04.298 --> 41:06.298
So...

41:06.300 --> 41:10.577
clearly, the law is not as cutanddried.

41:11.744 --> 41:13.972
Clearly, that's why we need your help,

41:13.974 --> 41:16.416
why we need your opinion.

41:16.944 --> 41:19.411
Now, I believe we've proven

41:19.413 --> 41:22.714
that the only thing my client did

41:22.716 --> 41:26.785
was do her job to the
absolute best of her ability.

41:26.787 --> 41:30.255
Be a mother to the absolute best
of her ability.

41:30.680 --> 41:34.587
To administer mercy whenever
she saw the opportunity.

41:34.589 --> 41:37.312
Now, if you think that's a crime,
then you know how to vote.

41:38.699 --> 41:40.523
But if you're like me...

41:41.858 --> 41:43.402
you know, you think that's something

41:43.404 --> 41:45.938
that should be encouraged
in our society...

41:45.940 --> 41:49.074
I just ask that you do one thing
today, and that's just...

41:49.574 --> 41:52.660
do for Laura what she would do for you.

41:54.081 --> 41:56.039
Show her the best care possible.

41:56.617 --> 41:57.957
Thank you.

42:00.082 --> 42:02.487
<i>Has the jury</i> reached a verdict?

42:02.489 --> 42:04.172
We have, Your Honor.

42:04.758 --> 42:06.693
We the jury find the defendant,

42:06.695 --> 42:08.176
Laura Allen...

42:08.968 --> 42:10.429
not guilty.

42:32.119 --> 42:34.386
Yes.

42:36.991 --> 42:40.959
For someone who just lost,
you don't seem terribly upset.

42:40.961 --> 42:43.028
How can I be upset?

42:43.030 --> 42:44.630
The system worked.

42:44.632 --> 42:47.799
It was the outcome
that the people wanted.

42:47.801 --> 42:50.435
At least all the people here.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.137
And that's how it's supposed to be.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.774
I did my part, you did yours.

42:56.224 --> 42:58.143
Justice was served.

43:01.682 --> 43:03.715
Well, she's a tough one.

43:03.717 --> 43:05.317
Yeah.

43:05.319 --> 43:07.402
You could tell she was out for blood.

43:08.122 --> 43:09.588
You think so?

43:09.590 --> 43:12.857
Without a doubt.

44:40.314 --> 44:43.181
It's kinda like paying more
for... gourmet chicken nuggets.

I don't want to do that.

Target - dog food.

45:25.425 --> 45:26.525
Target - dog...

45:26.560 --> 45:27.971
Remember to find that photo from Orlando,

45:27.995 --> 45:29.728
fix these brakes,

45:29.763 --> 45:30.328
figure out how to make

45:30.364 --> 45:31.263
an exploding glitter cake

45:31.298 --> 45:31.930

45:31.965 --> 45:33.064
Stupid lights..

45:35.269 --> 45:36.968
The sky looks amazing.

45:37.004 --> 45:38.303
I look amazing.

45:38.338 --> 45:39.571
I should take a selfie.

45:40.908 --> 45:42.073
Hey, buddy.

45:42.109 --> 45:44.810
Are you gonna wake me
up for my 9am meeting?

45:44.845 --> 45:45.845
No way.

45:47.514 --> 45:48.180
Hey Google.

45:48.215 --> 45:50.515
<i>Hi, what can I do for you.</i>

47:03.657 --> 47:05.123
This is Pride.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.491
Deputy Director Sanchez here.

47:06.493 --> 47:07.759
We got a situation.

47:07.761 --> 47:09.461
Do I need to move to a secure phone?

47:09.463 --> 47:11.997
No time. A lieutenant commander
was killed.

47:11.999 --> 47:13.665
I need you to report to Belle Chasse

47:13.667 --> 47:16.001
for immediate transport to South America.

47:16.003 --> 47:17.969
Shouldn't the Southeast
Field Office be handling that?

47:17.971 --> 47:19.771
You've been personally requested.

47:19.773 --> 47:21.473
You're authorized to bring
two agents with you.

47:21.475 --> 47:23.275
No one else.

47:23.277 --> 47:24.943
Well, all right. Who's...

47:24.945 --> 47:26.611
Who requested me? Who's the victim?

47:26.613 --> 47:27.812
It's classified.

47:27.814 --> 47:29.347
You'll be read in on arrival.

47:29.349 --> 47:31.416
You've got 90 minutes until wheels up.

47:31.418 --> 47:33.251

47:45.666 --> 47:46.998
Hello?

47:47.000 --> 47:48.733
Sebastian, sorry to wake you.

47:48.735 --> 47:50.201
Is everything okay?

47:50.203 --> 47:52.003
No, eeveryone's fine. Listen.

47:52.005 --> 47:56.574
Need to call Sonja,
pack your bag and your gear.

47:56.576 --> 47:58.009
We're headed to South America.

47:58.011 --> 48:00.779
South America? Belle Chasse in 90.

48:02.582 --> 48:03.815
Hey, sorry I'm late.

48:03.817 --> 48:06.251
Sebastian, what the hell?

48:06.253 --> 48:07.419
I know. I know. I overpacked.

48:07.421 --> 48:09.354
II get travel anxiety.

48:09.356 --> 48:12.357
Hello. Forgot one.

48:12.359 --> 48:14.059
Okay. Where's Sonja?

48:14.061 --> 48:16.027
Is she okay?

48:16.029 --> 48:17.562
Yeah. She had a prior engagement.

48:17.564 --> 48:19.030
It's 3:15 in the morning.

48:19.032 --> 48:20.398
What kind of prior engagement...?

48:20.400 --> 48:21.466
It's for tomorrow morning.

48:21.468 --> 48:22.801
That's all I can say.

48:22.803 --> 48:24.636
What do you mean that's all you can say?

48:26.640 --> 48:28.807
I wanted Sonja here for a reason.

48:31.178 --> 48:32.477
Ready for you, sir.

48:35.382 --> 48:37.549
Come on. We got a plane to catch.

48:42.356 --> 48:44.923
God.

49:07.914 --> 49:11.082
Special Agent Pride,
I'm Colonel Stanley Parker,

49:11.084 --> 49:13.218
commanding officer here at Camp Apache.

49:13.220 --> 49:15.587
Special Agent Gregorio,
Forensic Agent Lund.

49:15.589 --> 49:17.022
Where is "here," Colonel?

49:17.024 --> 49:18.223
Triple Frontier.

49:18.225 --> 49:20.358
Most dangerous place in South America.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.994
Didn't know we had a base in the
Frontier. Officially, we don't.

49:22.996 --> 49:24.896
I'll fill you in on the move.
It's not secure

49:24.898 --> 49:26.831
to stay in this area too long.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.600
Wait, wait. Not secure?

49:28.602 --> 49:30.869
Why? 'Cause... 'cause of, like, snipers?

49:32.305 --> 49:34.305
Come on, Sebastian.

49:34.307 --> 49:36.374
It's snipers. Okay, that's fine.

49:36.376 --> 49:38.576
Knew I should have packed camo.

49:38.578 --> 49:41.579
The Triple Frontier
is the triborder junction

49:41.581 --> 49:43.448
of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil.

49:43.450 --> 49:44.783
No law. No government.

49:44.785 --> 49:46.418
Breeding ground for organized crime,

49:46.420 --> 49:47.752
militias and cartels.

49:47.754 --> 49:49.487
Our mission is drug interdiction.

49:49.489 --> 49:52.290
A JSOC task force comprised
of Green Berets, Navy SEALs

49:52.292 --> 49:54.092
and various alphabet agencies.

49:57.097 --> 49:58.630
A lot of military resources

49:58.632 --> 50:00.632
to be thrown at some drug dealers.

50:00.634 --> 50:04.869
We're not hunting down street
pushers, Special Agent Lund.

50:04.871 --> 50:07.472
Our target's the most wanted man
in the Southern Hemisphere.

50:07.474 --> 50:09.307
You're after Sergio Rivera?

50:09.309 --> 50:10.742
Heavyweight champion of drug lords.

50:10.744 --> 50:12.544
Unified half a dozen cartels to become

50:12.546 --> 50:14.646
one of the biggest players
in the trafficking world.

50:14.648 --> 50:16.448
Until his lieutenants staged a coup.

50:16.450 --> 50:17.649
Tried to kill him.

50:17.651 --> 50:19.217
He went into hiding.

50:19.219 --> 50:22.353
For the past two years
nobody could find him.

50:23.990 --> 50:25.557
Until last night.

50:25.559 --> 50:27.926
You found him?

50:27.928 --> 50:30.395
We knew he was somewhere in the frontier.

50:30.397 --> 50:32.464
Confirmed his location a few days ago.

50:32.466 --> 50:35.467
Sent in a unit to extract him...
alive, if possible.

50:35.469 --> 50:37.569
Walked right into an ambush.

50:37.571 --> 50:39.737
Rivera was wounded.

50:39.739 --> 50:41.906
Unit leader was KIA.

50:41.908 --> 50:44.742
I'm sorry, Colonel.

50:44.744 --> 50:47.579
But where does NCIS fit in?

50:47.581 --> 50:50.615
Dead officer is Lieutenant
Commander Daryll Watkins.

50:50.617 --> 50:52.450
Lieutenant Comman...

50:55.856 --> 50:58.423
I know Daryll.

50:58.425 --> 51:00.358
From a lifetime ago.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.961
That why you requested me?

51:02.963 --> 51:04.796
I didn't request you, Agent Pride,

51:04.798 --> 51:07.031
Commander Watkins did.

51:09.469 --> 51:11.870
I've got Rivera. We've been compromised.

51:11.872 --> 51:13.438
They were waiting for us.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.039
If something happens to me,

51:15.041 --> 51:17.375
contact Dwayne Pride in NCIS.

51:17.377 --> 51:19.644
Tell him we have a mole.

51:19.646 --> 51:21.713
Come on.
