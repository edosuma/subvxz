18:04.972 --> 18:06.090
So...

18:06.090 --> 18:07.103
So what's Paige gonna think

18:07.103 --> 18:08.449
about the fact that I might have more kids

18:08.449 --> 18:09.780
than an NBA player?

18:10.288 --> 18:12.660
Why 13 years later are you
suddenly worried about this?

18:12.660 --> 18:13.935
Because I totally forgot about it.

18:13.935 --> 18:15.895
Then Paige got pregnant. It just hit me.

18:15.895 --> 18:16.985
Paige is pregnant?

18:16.985 --> 18:18.314
No, she was pregnant. Now she's not.

18:18.314 --> 18:18.993
That's not the point.

18:18.993 --> 18:20.833
The point is we're trying,
and Paige doesn't know

18:20.833 --> 18:22.795
that our baby, whenever it comes,

18:22.795 --> 18:24.379
might have hundreds and
hundreds of siblings.

18:24.379 --> 18:25.738
Okay, okay, it doesn't work like that.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.347
Would you please fill me
in on Paige's pregnancy?

18:28.688 --> 18:30.464
She was pregnant.

18:31.493 --> 18:33.541
And then she wasn't.

18:33.541 --> 18:35.558
That's really helpful. Thank you.

18:35.558 --> 18:37.885
After it ended, did she go see her doctor?

18:37.885 --> 18:38.663
How is she?

18:38.663 --> 18:40.600
Her doctor is out of town for the week.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.034
Didn't seem like waiting was a big deal.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.116
Why, is waiting a big deal?

18:43.116 --> 18:44.118
No, no, I'm sure she's fine.

18:44.118 --> 18:45.463
But you okay if I give her a call?

18:45.463 --> 18:46.974
- Of course.
- Okay.

18:46.974 --> 18:47.826
One more thing,

18:47.826 --> 18:49.281
donating your sperm?

18:49.281 --> 18:50.318
What were you thinking?

18:50.318 --> 18:52.218
There are easier ways to make money.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.694
Name one.

18:57.684 --> 18:59.248
That's a fair point.

19:05.307 --> 19:07.754
Oh, thank you for coming so quickly.

19:07.754 --> 19:09.392
Come on, Gretl, up.

19:09.392 --> 19:10.570
I'm Caroline Koch.

19:10.570 --> 19:11.468
I'm Dr. Sacani.

19:11.468 --> 19:13.454
This is Divya. You said it was an emergency?

19:13.454 --> 19:15.023
My tongue died.

19:15.244 --> 19:17.808
Oh, uh, is it feeling numb

19:17.808 --> 19:19.031
or painful?

19:19.031 --> 19:20.497
So much worse than that.

19:20.497 --> 19:22.941
And the scariest thing is
I know why it happened.

19:22.941 --> 19:23.764
Oh, you do?

19:23.764 --> 19:24.426
Yeah.

19:24.426 --> 19:26.229
While Gunther and I don't have children,

19:26.229 --> 19:27.428
we do have our babies,

19:27.428 --> 19:29.686
and like any good mama I love my babies.

19:29.686 --> 19:32.392
And I show them this love with
lots of kisses and cuddles.

19:32.392 --> 19:34.315
But yesterday after I kissed Gretl,

19:34.315 --> 19:36.763
I realized she had dragged a
dead squirrel into the house.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.733
Actually, it was half a
squirrel, the wrong half.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.367
You look so familiar.

19:40.367 --> 19:43.166
Anyway, after I noticed the dead rodent,

19:43.166 --> 19:45.663
I immediately became
nauseous because I realized

19:45.663 --> 19:48.140
that whatever poison this vermin passed on

19:48.140 --> 19:50.040
to sweet Gretl, Gretl then passed on to me.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.248
How long do I have?

19:51.248 --> 19:53.094
Uh, may we see your tongue?

19:54.178 --> 19:56.080
Mrs. Koch, you're not going to die.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.702
Uh, well, eventually obviously.

19:57.702 --> 19:59.341
But did you take Pepto-Bismol

19:59.341 --> 20:00.475
when you became nauseous?

20:00.475 --> 20:01.657
How did you know that?

20:01.657 --> 20:03.512
Your discolored tongue is called by bismuth,

20:03.512 --> 20:05.083
an ingredient in Pepto-Bismol.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.847
The bismuth can combine
with sulfur in one's saliva

20:07.895 --> 20:09.854
to produce that type of discoloration,

20:09.854 --> 20:11.996
but that is all it is, an ugly tongue.

20:11.996 --> 20:14.226
And the discoloration
will go away on its own.

20:14.226 --> 20:16.359
Ah, thank you.

20:16.386 --> 20:19.322
Imagine the irony if Gunther outlived me.

20:19.322 --> 20:23.402
His tongue died years ago,
but that's not a problem.

20:24.415 --> 20:26.721
Okay, nice to meet you.

20:26.721 --> 20:27.932
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:27.932 --> 20:29.046
Don't go just yet.

20:29.046 --> 20:30.834
There is something else that is killing me.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.297
Divya, where do I know you from?

20:33.297 --> 20:35.622
Blackstone? Watermill Spa?

20:36.090 --> 20:40.109
Oh, you are "Socialite
Mom Who Abandoned Baby."

20:40.109 --> 20:42.023
You attacked that police officer.

20:42.023 --> 20:42.965
That's not what happened.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.380
How could you know that?

20:44.380 --> 20:48.412
Oh, honey, you are splashed
all over DansPapers.com.

20:50.057 --> 20:52.227
- Hey, excuse me.
- Sorry, ma'am.

20:52.227 --> 20:54.639
You'll have to take this up
with Child Protective Services.

20:54.639 --> 20:56.324
Child Protect... what?

20:56.324 --> 20:58.439
Hey, just... Hey, get...

20:58.439 --> 21:00.118
Get your hands off of me!

21:00.118 --> 21:01.619
Ma'am, you're under arrest.

21:03.311 --> 21:04.730
[sighs]

21:10.265 --> 21:11.987
More than half of all first pregnancies

21:11.987 --> 21:14.563
result in miscarriages
soon after conception.

21:14.563 --> 21:16.848
Usually the mother never
knows she was pregnant.

21:16.982 --> 21:20.517
But since at-home tests detect
pregnancy earlier than ever,

21:20.517 --> 21:22.098
women are finding out that they're pregnant

21:22.098 --> 21:23.815
before the miscarriage occurs,

21:23.850 --> 21:26.069
which is what I think happened.

21:26.082 --> 21:27.780
Do you think it'll happen again?

21:27.780 --> 21:28.962
I don't know.

21:28.962 --> 21:31.032
But your ultrasound looks fine.

21:32.038 --> 21:33.675
Okay.

21:37.303 --> 21:38.676
Hey.

21:38.687 --> 21:40.519
Are you okay?

21:41.398 --> 21:43.309
I am sad.

21:43.709 --> 21:46.160
And I'm scared

21:46.160 --> 21:49.015
that I might not be able to have a baby.

21:49.015 --> 21:51.844
I don't know anything about
my birth mother or father

21:51.844 --> 21:54.391
or their medical history.

21:54.886 --> 21:57.364
I can see why that would make you anxious.

21:57.699 --> 22:00.307
You know, you could get genetic testing.

22:00.535 --> 22:02.085
I mean, it may help answer

22:02.085 --> 22:03.891
whether or not you can have a baby.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.694
The thing is,

22:06.858 --> 22:09.274
I think I'm afraid to find out.

22:17.095 --> 22:18.655
So you ready for this?

22:18.655 --> 22:20.859
Well, I'm not sure about that.

22:20.859 --> 22:22.624

23:01.416 --> 23:02.734
Well, you know what?

23:02.734 --> 23:04.403
You should try the site I used.

23:04.403 --> 23:06.466
Yeah, don't need a picture to start.

23:06.512 --> 23:09.372
It's all about connecting you to
people based on who you are,

23:09.372 --> 23:10.768
not what you look like.

23:10.768 --> 23:11.950
That sounds more my style.

23:11.950 --> 23:12.712

23:12.712 --> 23:15.545
after you find a personality
match for your profile,

23:15.545 --> 23:17.172
then you can trade pictures.

23:17.172 --> 23:19.645
Yeah, I don't have a profile yet either.

23:20.664 --> 23:22.481
- Really?
- Really.

23:22.481 --> 23:23.912
You are really not good at this.

23:23.912 --> 23:25.368
Not good, no.

23:25.368 --> 23:26.840
Okay.

23:27.366 --> 23:30.847
So there are certain attributes

23:30.847 --> 23:32.252
you can use on your profile

23:32.252 --> 23:34.977
that are gonna attract
a high volume of women.

23:34.977 --> 23:35.693
Okay.

23:35.693 --> 23:37.916

23:37.916 --> 23:39.473

you don't play guitar or have any tattoos?

23:50.809 --> 23:52.702
I'll let you know when she finds out.

23:52.702 --> 23:53.801

- Yeah.

37:18.241 --> 37:19.989
Eat up, Big Daddy.

37:19.989 --> 37:21.776
You're gonna need your strength.

37:21.776 --> 37:23.561
[chuckles]

37:28.425 --> 37:30.780
So they're gonna put a
mesh tube inside your aorta

37:30.780 --> 37:31.601
to hold it open,

37:31.601 --> 37:33.194
which means you will be the proud owner

37:33.194 --> 37:34.414
of a stent graft.

37:34.414 --> 37:36.021
While that sounds like a ton of fun,

37:36.021 --> 37:38.652
um, I'm gonna have to miss the race?

37:38.652 --> 37:40.756
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

37:40.756 --> 37:42.926
And while there's no cure for Takayasu's,

37:42.926 --> 37:45.519
with annual check-ups you
should return to normal.

37:45.519 --> 37:47.443
Which means you'll make next year's race.

37:47.443 --> 37:49.840
Although by then, I may be out-swimming you.

37:49.879 --> 37:50.862
Ah.

37:50.862 --> 37:52.757
You know, I am a pretty good coach.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.103
More than you know.

37:54.103 --> 37:55.312
I have a date tonight,

37:55.312 --> 37:56.538
thanks to your advice.

37:56.538 --> 37:57.653
Nice.

37:57.653 --> 37:58.873
She a fan of <i> Homeland?</i>

37:58.873 --> 38:00.201
She's a fan of the New York Mets.

38:00.201 --> 38:01.626
MetsFan86.

38:01.626 --> 38:04.347
We are gonna listen to the game
tonight against the Phillies.

38:04.347 --> 38:05.147
Her idea.

38:05.147 --> 38:06.239
- Man, that's old-school.
- Yeah.

38:06.239 --> 38:07.754
Good taste in baseball teams.

38:07.754 --> 38:09.219
That could be love.

38:09.648 --> 38:11.462
Speaking of which,

38:11.923 --> 38:13.007
how'd it go with Jane?

38:13.007 --> 38:14.425
She's on her way right now.

38:14.425 --> 38:18.355
Uh, I don't know if I should
be more excited or terrified.

38:18.355 --> 38:19.976
Maybe both.

38:19.976 --> 38:21.832
Eh, that's a good point.

38:22.569 --> 38:25.332
Hey, when she gets here,

38:25.332 --> 38:27.493
you think I should, like, play it cool

38:27.493 --> 38:31.732
or maybe, uh, open up,
show her I'm vulnerable?

38:31.920 --> 38:33.924
How 'bout you just be yourself?

38:33.960 --> 38:34.834
Eh.

38:34.865 --> 38:35.695
And if that doesn't work,

38:35.695 --> 38:37.327
maybe get some guitar lessons and a tattoo.

38:37.327 --> 38:39.260
[chuckles] Yeah.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.101
Good advice.

39:05.264 --> 39:06.442
Oh.

39:06.476 --> 39:08.168
You're HamptDoc17?

39:08.168 --> 39:10.586
You're MetsFan86?

39:10.586 --> 39:11.867
It's fate.

39:11.867 --> 39:13.158
Yeah.

39:13.661 --> 39:14.907
How are you feeling?

39:14.944 --> 39:18.244
A million times better,
thanks to HamptDoc17.

39:18.275 --> 39:21.443
Imagine if I ended up with HamptDoc12.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.032
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

39:27.746 --> 39:31.099
Look, I know I didn't exactly
impress the other night.

39:31.624 --> 39:33.259
I'm sorry

39:33.259 --> 39:35.118
and a little mortified.

39:35.656 --> 39:38.511
And the worst part is
you're a really nice guy.

39:40.557 --> 39:42.596
Can you give me a second chance?

39:45.861 --> 39:47.312
Yeah.

39:47.347 --> 39:48.937
Sure, I can.

39:49.613 --> 39:50.809
Great.

39:53.687 --> 39:54.691
Nice spread.

39:54.691 --> 39:55.902
Yeah.

39:55.902 --> 39:59.112
My God, what a beautiful night, huh?

39:59.112 --> 40:00.896
Ah, it is.

40:02.991 --> 40:05.725
So have you always been a Mets fan or...

40:06.212 --> 40:07.952
Oh, pssh.

40:07.952 --> 40:09.513
No, I don't really follow baseball.

40:09.513 --> 40:10.705
My roommate told me to put that in there

40:10.705 --> 40:12.483
'cause she said I'd get a lot of hits.

40:12.483 --> 40:13.331
Oh.

40:13.331 --> 40:14.781
And here I am.

40:14.781 --> 40:16.293
Shot?

40:16.621 --> 40:18.288
[chuckles]

40:18.763 --> 40:20.998
Yeah, sure.

40:20.998 --> 40:21.917
Whoo!

40:24.753 --> 40:27.246
Yeah, there were some wonderful
candidates in Philadelphia.

40:27.282 --> 40:28.592
I winnowed out the ones I like less,

40:28.592 --> 40:30.725
but hopefully we can get

40:30.758 --> 40:32.366
the Center for Rare and Orphan Diseases...

40:32.366 --> 40:34.721
um, the lab fully staffed
by the end of the month.

40:34.721 --> 40:35.708
That's great.

40:35.708 --> 40:36.666
Yes, and with more manpower,

40:36.666 --> 40:39.039
we'll be able to genetically
engineer new models,

40:39.039 --> 40:40.736
from construct creation to microinjection,

40:40.736 --> 40:42.513
to evaluation and characterization.

40:42.513 --> 40:43.464
[cell phone beeps]

40:44.307 --> 40:45.743
Thank you.

40:45.743 --> 40:47.166
I'll be right back.

40:48.498 --> 40:50.456
This is very important, Sashi.

40:50.456 --> 40:52.040
Because when only a small population

40:52.040 --> 40:54.335
is afflicted by a disease,
the funding can be limited.

40:54.335 --> 40:56.649
But we'll be able to accelerate
research and development

40:56.689 --> 40:59.828
of new treatments by
building preclinical models,

40:59.828 --> 41:03.200
not only for ourselves but
for global entities as well.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.796
[softly] Come here. Come here.

41:07.180 --> 41:08.482
What's the matter?

41:08.482 --> 41:10.268
That was my attorney.

41:10.268 --> 41:14.546
Rafa's lawyers, they saw
that video of me online.

41:14.936 --> 41:17.568
They pulled the custody agreement.

41:18.567 --> 41:19.955
They think they have a case against me

41:19.977 --> 41:21.557
as an unfit mother.
