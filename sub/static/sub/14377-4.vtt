13:16.166 --> 13:18.133
I'm back!

13:18.166 --> 13:22.150
Dee Dee, get your stupid
imaginary friend
out of my life!

13:22.183 --> 13:25.333
Gosh, Dexter,
why don't you just
imagine him away?

13:25.366 --> 13:27.250
Just imagine him away?

13:27.283 --> 13:29.000
That's it!

13:29.033 --> 13:30.416
Koosalagoopagoop...

13:30.450 --> 13:33.000
I imagine you away!

13:33.033 --> 13:35.416
Away! Away! Away!

13:35.450 --> 13:38.216
Bye-bye, Dee Dee.
Bye-bye, Dexter.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.200
You'll never see me
again.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.366
Dexter!

13:41.400 --> 13:43.166
What have I done?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.250
Koosy!

14:14.250 --> 14:15.416
Dexter, what's that?

14:15.450 --> 14:17.200
Where?

14:17.233 --> 14:19.183
Very funny.

14:19.216 --> 14:21.033
I'm sorry.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.283
Dexter, what's that?

14:23.316 --> 14:25.033
Where?

14:25.066 --> 14:27.033
Will you cut it out?

14:27.066 --> 14:29.183
Ok.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.300
Dexter! What's that?!

14:31.333 --> 14:33.050
Oh, no.

14:33.083 --> 14:36.300
I'm not falling
for that again.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.333
[Claws snapping]

15:17.033 --> 15:19.083
Hmm.

15:19.116 --> 15:20.100
Ahh!

15:20.133 --> 15:21.350
Yes!

15:21.383 --> 15:25.266
It may have taken many hours
into the early morning,

15:25.300 --> 15:27.333
but that<i>is</i>
the equation!

15:29.116 --> 15:33.033
Ha ha ha! When I think
of all the fools

15:33.066 --> 15:35.383
when I unleash
the power of--

15:37.133 --> 15:40.266
[thinking]
It seems that in my quest
for ultimate knowledge,

15:40.300 --> 15:43.316
I have overlooked
my homework.

15:43.350 --> 15:45.316
[Yawn]

15:45.350 --> 15:48.050
This assignment
does not seem hard.

15:48.083 --> 15:51.216
Shouldn't take me
more than a minute.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.050
But first a little break,

15:54.083 --> 15:55.216
and then the homework.

15:55.250 --> 16:00.083
I'll just rest my eyes
for a...Few...

16:00.116 --> 16:01.333
Moments.

16:01.366 --> 16:03.116

Hey, puppet pal clem,

16:10.016 --> 16:12.033
where do people keep
their money?

16:12.066 --> 16:13.366
Second man: Duh.
Don't know.

is awake at this hour?

16:26.383 --> 16:28.250

My homework. Must wash.

16:33.183 --> 16:35.033
My homework. Breakfast.

16:35.066 --> 16:37.450
I have never been late
for school.

16:37.483 --> 16:41.350
My perfect record
will be tarnished...

16:41.383 --> 16:44.116
Unless there is a way!

16:44.150 --> 16:47.283
This is incredibly
dangerous.

16:47.316 --> 16:49.283
However...

16:49.316 --> 16:51.283
What is science...

16:51.316 --> 16:54.183
Without the risk?

16:55.483 --> 16:58.433
My time-expansion helmet

16:58.466 --> 17:02.066
will turn 30 seconds
into 30 minutes

17:02.100 --> 17:03.250
and give me plenty of time

17:03.283 --> 17:06.150
to complete
my morning tasks.

20:01.083 --> 20:04.383
Foolish Dee Dee.
The school bus will
be here any second,

20:04.416 --> 20:06.416
and she is still
not ready.

20:08.316 --> 20:11.033
My 30 minutes
are almost up!

20:11.066 --> 20:12.466
Must finish homework.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.266

20:16.300 --> 20:19.116

The bus!

21:02.283 --> 21:06.083
I have missed the bus.

21:06.116 --> 21:09.100
I have become...Tardy.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.266
My spotless record...

21:11.300 --> 21:14.100
A lifetime
of perfection--

21:14.133 --> 21:17.266
destroyed!
