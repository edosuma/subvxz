WEBVTT

00:56.143 --> 00:59.581
HMM. I GOT
YOUR COFFEE.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.715
ARE WE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS?

01:03.759 --> 01:05.848
I'M LATE. TRAFFIC'S
ALREADY A MESS.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.458
DAVID, COME ON.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.026
HAVE YOU SEEN MY KEYS?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.680
THEY'RE IN YOUR HAND.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.249
I--
STOP.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.035
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.472
UM, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE HOME.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.952
DON'T WAIT UP.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.369
HELLO, SIR. HI.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.805
HEY.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.200
UH, WHEN DO THE BANDAGES
COME OFF?

01:53.243 --> 01:55.376
THE DOC SAYS A WEEK.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.204
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

01:57.247 --> 01:59.597
GOOD. I'M GOOD.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.342
I THINK HE'S BEEN HERE
ALL WEEKEND.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.220
SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.483
SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.
WHY DIDN'T I SEE IT?

02:17.702 --> 02:20.705
HOW MUCH SLEEP HAVE YOU
GOTTEN SINCE WE GOT BACK?

02:20.749 --> 02:22.098
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.317
IT WAS RIGHT THERE,
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.535
NONE OF US DID.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.323
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

02:29.366 --> 02:31.281
FINE.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.031
NOT YOU, TOO.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.033
YOU'RE TIRED OF
PEOPLE ASKING YOU

02:44.076 --> 02:45.513
HOW YOU'RE DOING?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.473
YES, I AM.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.302
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

02:52.346 --> 02:56.045
IT'S AN OPEN INVESTIGATION.
THAT'S ALL.

02:56.088 --> 02:59.222
WE LOST THE FIRST TIME, BUT
WE'LL GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.484
YES, WE WILL.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.399
THIS TEAM DOESN'T
TAKE CARE OF ME.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.707
I TAKE CARE OF THEM.
THAT'S MY JOB.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.145
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU DO THAT JOB SO WELL,

03:09.189 --> 03:11.582
WE WANT TO BE THERE
FOR YOU WHEN WE CAN.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.544
YOU WENT THROUGH
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
OUT THERE,

03:16.587 --> 03:18.633
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP IT
BOTTLED UP.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.548
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.942
SO, DAVE, THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE QUESTION,

03:23.986 --> 03:27.163
AND IT'S NOT
"HOW ARE YOU DOING?"

03:27.207 --> 03:29.383
IT'S, WHO DO YOU
TRUST ENOUGH

03:29.426 --> 03:32.647
TO SAY "I'M NOT
DOING SO GOOD"?

03:41.351 --> 03:43.092
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:45.529 --> 03:48.489
I GOT SENT HOME BY
THE PRINCIPAL.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.536
YOU READY TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.488
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER:
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.450
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.886
I'M HERE.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.934
I'M HERE.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.068
THANKS.

05:31.069 --> 05:35.335
AH. IT'S PORTIA.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.511
SO HOW IS
MY SOON-TO-BE

05:37.554 --> 05:39.121
STEPDAUGHTER DOING?

05:39.164 --> 05:41.689
SHE LIKES TO SHARE
QUOTES WITH ME.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.343
HERE'S TODAY'S.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.910
STEPHEN KING WROTE,

05:45.954 --> 05:50.524
"THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
ARE THE HARDEST TO SAY."

05:50.567 --> 05:55.485
HOW WEIRDLY APPROPRIATE.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.836
COME ON.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.230
WE ARE GETTING MARRIED
IN 3 WEEKS.

06:01.273 --> 06:04.015
AND IF WE WANT THIS TO WORK,

06:04.059 --> 06:06.453
YOU HAVE TO LET ME IN.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.416
IT STARTED WHEN WE
GOT CALLED IN

06:13.460 --> 06:14.852
ON A SINGLE.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.419
A SINGLE HOMICIDE

06:16.463 --> 06:18.247
IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.684
THAT IS, FIREFIGHTERS
RESPONDED TO A HOUSE FIRE

06:20.728 --> 06:22.207
IN THE GREEN HILLS
NEIGHBORHOOD

06:22.251 --> 06:23.818
AND WERE ABLE
TO PUT OUT THE FIRE

06:23.861 --> 06:25.559
BEFORE IT DESTROYED
EVERYTHING,

06:25.602 --> 06:28.953
BUT THEY DISCOVERED THE BODY
OF MONICA FEINSTEIN,

06:28.997 --> 06:30.912
WITH A COMPLETE FACE LIFT.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.348
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE KIND THAT YOU NEED

06:32.392 --> 06:33.567
A WEEKEND AND A BOTTLE OF
ASPIRIN TO GET OVER.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.438
I'M TALKING CHEEK TO CHEEK,
NECK TO NOGGIN.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.833
HER WHOLE FACE WAS LIFTED,
LIKE, REMOVED FROM HER--

06:38.876 --> 06:40.443
LEWIS: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, BURNS ON THE BODY

06:40.487 --> 06:42.619
WERE LIMITED
TO THE LEGS AND FEET,

06:42.663 --> 06:45.622
BUT KNIFE MARKS WENT
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO THE SKULL.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.841
POSSIBLY SYMBOLIC.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.277
WERE THE CUTS
POSTMORTEM?

06:48.320 --> 06:49.713
THEY WERE. CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS STRANGULATION.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.976
SO THE FACE IS
A TROPHY.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.978
HE TOOK IT WITH HIM
TO RELIVE WHAT HE DID.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.589
REID: AS WITH
JEFFREY DAHMER,

06:55.632 --> 06:56.590
KILLERS OFTEN COLLECT
BODY PARTS

06:56.633 --> 06:58.156
TO COMBAT A FEELING
OF INADEQUACY.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.681
THEY SEE THE TROPHY
AS AN EXTENSION OF
THEIR OWN IDENTITY,

07:00.724 --> 07:02.291
SOMETHING THEY'D RATHER DIE
THAN GIVE UP.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.814
HOW DID THE UNSUB
SET THE FIRE?

07:03.858 --> 07:08.079
GARCIA: FIREFIGHTERS SOURCED
THE FLAMES TO A LIT STOVE

07:08.123 --> 07:11.169
AND THEN DISCOVERED EVIDENCE
OF CORRODED GAS PIPES.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.867
THE GAS PIPES ARE MADE OF
GALVANIZED STEEL,

07:12.910 --> 07:15.478
AND THE HOUSE IS ONLY
A FEW YEARS OLD.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.088
THE UNSUB COULD'VE USED
SULFURIC ACID

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
TO MIMIC THE EFFECTS
OF CORROSION.

07:18.699 --> 07:19.874
YEAH, HE'S GONE TO
GREAT LENGTHS

07:19.917 --> 07:21.484
TO MAKE THE FIRE
LOOK LIKE
AN ACCIDENT.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
NO FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.488
BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN
WOULD BE A PERFECT WAY
TO COVER YOUR TRACKS.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.490
THE SOPHISTICATION SUGGESTS
THIS ISN'T HIS FIRST,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.013
AND HE'S PROBABLY
PLANNING MORE.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.667
WHEELS UP IN 20.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.454
DID YOU FIND ANY OTHER
VICTIMS?

07:34.497 --> 07:36.020
NOT ON THE FIRST SWEEP.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.633
SO WE DISCUSSED
WHAT WE KNEW

07:39.676 --> 07:41.286
ON OUR WAY
TO NASHVILLE.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.639
MONICA FEINSTEIN, 52.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.684
TAUGHT PRESCHOOL,
VOLUNTEERED IN
A SOUP KITCHEN.

07:47.728 --> 07:48.946
SINGLE MOM, ADULT SON.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.731
ABOUT AS LOW-RISK A LIFESTYLE
AS YOU CAN GET.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.254
PRENTISS: AND THERE'S
NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY,

07:52.297 --> 07:54.648
SO, THE UNSUB WAS EITHER
SOMEONE SHE KNEW

07:54.691 --> 07:56.040
OR DIDN'T SEE AS A THREAT.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.607
HE SETS THE FIRE TO
DESTROY THE EVIDENCE,

07:57.651 --> 07:59.000
BUT HE COULD ALSO BE
SETTING IT

07:59.043 --> 08:00.218
TO HIDE HIS OWN SHAME
OR DISGUST

08:00.262 --> 08:01.524
FOR HAVING TAKEN
THE FACE.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.699
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE,

08:02.743 --> 08:03.961
BUT EVEN IF IT WAS
A TROPHY,

08:04.005 --> 08:05.746
HE MIGHT'VE
HATED HIMSELF
FOR WANTING IT.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.617
ROSSI: MOST UNSUBS HAVE
A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP

08:07.661 --> 08:08.966
WITH THEIR COMPULSIONS.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.925
WHICH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE
EROTOPHONOPHILIA.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.927
KRYSTALL:
EROTOPHONO-WHAT?

08:12.970 --> 08:15.538
IT'S A $10 WORD
FOR LUST MURDER.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.540
IT INVOLVES THE MUTILATION
OF BODY PARTS

08:17.584 --> 08:19.324
THE UNSUB FINDS MOST
ATTRACTIVE.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.153
NOW, IT COULD BE FEET
OR KNEECAPS,

08:22.197 --> 08:24.939
BUT IT'S USUALLY
BREASTS OR GENITAL--

08:24.982 --> 08:26.506
OK, GOT IT. GOT IT.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.724
YOU ASKED.
OK, WELL,

08:27.768 --> 08:28.943
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE
SHOULD HAVE

08:28.986 --> 08:30.161
A SAFE WORD
OR SOMETHING.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.728
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST TELL ME

08:31.772 --> 08:34.383
WHEN TO LEAVE SOMETHING
TO THE IMAGINATION.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.559
DEAL. OK.

08:36.603 --> 08:41.303
SO IN THIS CASE,
IT WAS THE FACE. WHY?

08:41.346 --> 08:44.785
THAT'S THE QUESTION
WE PURSUED WHEN WE LANDED.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.835
SIMMONS: ACCORDING
TO THE AUTOPSY,

08:51.879 --> 08:54.751
THE CUTS ON MONICA
WERE ROUGH
AND IMPRECISE.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.971
BUT HE HAD
ALREADY STRANGLED HER.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.668
HE HAD THE TIME AND CONTROL
TO DO WHAT HE WANTS.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.843
HE HAD NO REASON TO RUSH.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.845
BASED ON HIS SKILL
AND ORGANIZATION,

09:01.889 --> 09:03.543
IT'S NOT INEXPERIENCE.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.153
IT COULD BE THAT
HE LOSES CONTROL

09:05.196 --> 09:06.850
BECAUSE HE'S OBTAINED
GRATIFICATION.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.591
A DOPAMINE RUSH
IS SIMILAR
TO DRUG ADDICTION,

09:08.635 --> 09:11.463
WHERE A FEELING OF
EUPHORIA SUSPENDS
FINE MOTOR SKILLS.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.987
PRENTISS: MONICA FEINSTEIN
HAS A GROWN SON?

09:13.030 --> 09:15.772
YEAH, CARL,
AGE 19. HE GOES TO
TENNESSEE TECH.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.295
PRENTISS:
LET'S BRING HIM IN.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.645
IF THE UNSUB WAS SOMEBODY
MONICA KNEW,

09:18.688 --> 09:20.908
HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE US A SUSPECT.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.524
YEAH. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO DID THIS.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.223
HIS NAME'S MAC.
HE, UH--

09:32.267 --> 09:34.008
HE WAS DATING MY MOM.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.836
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM?

09:35.879 --> 09:37.838
DORKY, BORING.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.841
HE ALWAYS WORE
THESE, UH--

09:40.884 --> 09:43.321
THESE
WOOL SWEATERS.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.888
HE NEVER
STAYED OVER.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.673
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO PROTECT

09:46.716 --> 09:48.326
MY MOTHER'S VIRTUE.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.807
THE KIND OF GUY THAT
WOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY

09:50.851 --> 09:52.635
TO APPEAR NONTHREATENING?

09:52.679 --> 09:53.984
YEAH.

09:54.028 --> 09:57.248
YOU WENT RIGHT AFTER HIM
AS YOUR MOTHER'S KILLER.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.033
HOW COME?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.643
BECAUSE YESTERDAY

10:00.687 --> 10:03.472
I CAME HOME TO HELP
MY MOM AROUND THE HOUSE.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.256
MAC: DON'T WORRY,
HONEY.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.258
I'LL BE HOME SOON.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.522
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
BYE.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.352
HEY, WHO'S THAT?
HUH?

10:14.396 --> 10:17.660
OH, HO. HEY! CARL,
I WAS--I WAS JUST--

10:17.704 --> 10:20.794
CARL: NO, NO. WHO,
UH, WHO WAS THAT?

10:20.837 --> 10:23.144
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

10:23.187 --> 10:25.625
NO. HE JUST SAID
"I LOVE YOU"

10:25.668 --> 10:26.974
TO SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.062
UH...

10:29.846 --> 10:31.282
YEAH, MY MOM.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.937
OH, YEAH? YOU CALL
YOUR MOTHER "HONEY"?

10:33.981 --> 10:35.417
YEAH, I DO.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.853
MONICA:
HE DOES.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.813
I'VE HEARD HIM.
HE CHECKS ON HER
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.511
OK, HAVE YOU
EVER MET HIS MOTHER?

10:42.554 --> 10:43.991
NO, I HAVEN'T,
BUT--

10:44.034 --> 10:45.732
HEY, LET'S CLEAR THE AIR

10:45.775 --> 10:49.431
AND ADDRESS WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON HERE, YEAH?

10:49.474 --> 10:52.652
YOU'RE BEING PROTECTIVE
OF YOUR MOM. HEH!

10:52.695 --> 10:54.131
AND AS YOU SHOULD,
BECAUSE SHE IS

10:54.175 --> 10:56.830
AN INCREDIBLY
SPECIAL WOMAN.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.396
BUT I WANT TO--

10:58.440 --> 11:00.094
I WANT TO PROVE TO YOU
HOW PURE MY INTENTIONS
ARE WITH HER,

11:00.137 --> 11:01.748
BECAUSE I KNOW
THIS HAS BEEN FAST.

11:01.791 --> 11:06.143
UM, I'VE BEEN WAITING
MY WHOLE LIFE FOR YOU...

11:08.102 --> 11:10.365
AND I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
ANY LONGER.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.236
WHAT?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.498
WHAT?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.025
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

11:18.068 --> 11:20.157
OH, OF COURSE
I WILL.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.508
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.945
I LOVE IT.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.729
CARL, VOICE-OVER: I COULDN'T
STAND WATCHING HER

11:26.773 --> 11:29.689
MAKE SUCH AN AWFUL DECISION
LIKE THAT, SO I LEFT.

11:29.732 --> 11:33.040
HE MUST'VE KILLED HER
AS SOON AS I WAS GONE.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.695
YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF MAC?

11:37.958 --> 11:43.485
MY MOM, SHE POSTED A LOT
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

11:43.528 --> 11:46.706
HERE'S ALL HIS
CONTACT INFO.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.273
ALVEZ: PAUL MacINTYRE,
AKA "MAC."

11:49.317 --> 11:52.059
HE DATED MONICA TWO MONTHS
BEFORE HE PROPOSED TO HER.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.843
AND THE ADDRESS HE GAVE HER
WAS A FAKE,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.063
AND THE PHONE NUMBER THAT HE
GAVE TO HER WAS

11:56.106 --> 11:57.847
FOR A BURNER THAT'S NOW
BEEN DISCONNECTED.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.240
REID: YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE
AN UNSUB WHO TARGETS

11:59.283 --> 12:00.981
A LONELY HEARTS
VICTIMOLOGY--

12:01.024 --> 12:03.940
MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN
WHO ARE EMOTIONALLY
SUSCEPTIBLE TO HIS CHARISMA.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.377
JAREAU: AND HE
TAKES HIS CHARM
AND HARM SEDUCTION

12:06.421 --> 12:07.944
ALL THE WAY UP
TO THE PROPOSAL

12:07.988 --> 12:08.989
AND KILLS THEM.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.774
PRENTISS: GARCIA,
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.950
OK, I RAN THIS PHOTO
OF MR. MacINTYRE

12:13.994 --> 12:15.822
THROUGH FACIAL RECOGNITION,

12:15.865 --> 12:17.562
AND I'M TELLING YOU WITH
MY FULL CONFIDENCE

12:17.606 --> 12:18.825
HE DOES NOT EXIST.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.609
AND I WANT TO BE REALLY
CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.176
I'M NOT SAYING HE
COVERED HIS TRACKS.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.526
I'M SAYING THIS GUY IS
A STONE-COLD APPARITION.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.180
IS THERE ANYTHING
IN THE CREATION OF
THE FALSE IDENTITY

12:26.223 --> 12:27.790
WE CAN TRACK?

12:27.834 --> 12:31.098
OK. ACCORDING TO HIS
FAUX DATING PROFILE,

12:31.141 --> 12:32.882
HE VALUES FAMILY
AND SERVING THE HOMELESS,

12:32.926 --> 12:34.231
WHICH WOULD BE REALLY
CUTE IF, YOU KNOW,

12:34.275 --> 12:36.712
HE DIDN'T CUT HER FACE OFF
AND BURN HER HOUSE DOWN.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.105
HELPING THE HOMELESS WAS

12:38.148 --> 12:39.846
EXACTLY WHAT MONICA
WAS INTERESTED IN.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.544
THE UNSUB WAS CREATING
A PERSONA TAILOR-MADE

12:42.587 --> 12:44.111
TO GET HER GUARD DOWN.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
WHAT ABOUT
FINANCIAL RECORDS?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.984
GARCIA: OH, THIS IS WHERE
THINGS GET REALLY NASTY.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.334
ACTUALLY, THE PART ABOUT
THE FACE IS THE NASTY THING,

12:50.378 --> 12:53.207
BUT I'M SENDING YOU
THE SPECIFICS ON THIS.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.992
SHORTLY BEFORE DATING
MONICA, THE UNSUB OPENED

12:56.036 --> 12:57.820
A BANK ACCOUNT USING
THIS FAKE IDENTITY.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.213
HE USED IT AS A FENCE
TO CREATE

12:59.256 --> 13:01.041
AN UNTRACEABLE
OFFSHORE ACCOUNT.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.695
HE WAS DRAINING MONICA'S
MONEY THE WHOLE TIME
THEY WERE DATING.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.828
GARCIA: AND THEN THE
LOW-DOWN, LYING SLEAZEBALL

13:05.872 --> 13:07.090
CLOSED SAID ACCOUNT.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.439
AND WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

13:08.483 --> 13:09.919
DON'T WE, MY PRETTIES?

13:09.963 --> 13:10.920
HE'S A CON MAN.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.009
LEWIS: YEAH, BUT CON MEN
RESORT TO VIOLENCE

13:13.053 --> 13:14.358
ONLY OUT OF NECESSITY.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.838
IF HE HAD A FALSE IDENTITY,

13:15.882 --> 13:17.057
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER
JUST TO SKIP TOWN

13:17.100 --> 13:18.580
THAN MURDER MONICA.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.712
MAYBE AFTER THE PROPOSAL,
MONICA DISCOVERED HE

13:20.756 --> 13:21.975
WASN'T WHO HE SAID HE WAS,

13:22.018 --> 13:24.847
AND THEN HE KILLED HER TO
PROTECT HIS ANONYMITY.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.980
BUT THEN WHY GO
TO THESE LENGTHS?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.329
WHY START THE FIRE?

13:28.372 --> 13:30.853
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHY CUT OFF THE FACE?

13:30.897 --> 13:34.378
I WAS WONDERING
THAT, TOO.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.163
I MEAN, I'VE MET MY
SHARE OF CON MEN

13:36.206 --> 13:38.861
DEALING BLACKJACK
IN VEGAS,

13:38.905 --> 13:40.820
BUT ALL THEY CARE
ABOUT IS THE SCORE.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.822
EXACTLY. HIS RITUAL
DIDN'T MATCH

13:42.865 --> 13:44.562
WHAT A TYPICAL GRIFTER
WOULD DO.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.390
SO WHY GO THROUGH
ALL THAT STUFF

13:46.434 --> 13:48.175
WITH THE FACE
AND THE FIRE?

13:48.218 --> 13:49.393
WE WEREN'T SURE.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.917
AND WHILE WE WERE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.614
HE'D ALREADY LEFT THE STATE...

13:54.834 --> 13:57.010
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER: AND DID WHAT
EVERY CON MAN DOES

13:57.053 --> 13:58.881
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE RUN.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.493
HE STARTED OVER.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.063
HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:50.106 --> 14:51.368
WOMAN: TURN TO THE LEFT.

14:51.412 --> 14:54.067
NOW TO THE RIGHT.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.633
IT'S GREAT.
THEY'RE ALL GREAT.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.026
I ALSO LIKE THE TAN ONE
AND THE NAVY ONE.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.724
YOU ARE LITERALLY NO HELP.

15:02.466 --> 15:06.079
OHH. I'M SORRY
I'M LATE, HONEY.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.950
MEETING IN
NASHVILLE WENT LONG.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.778
DIDN'T GET ON
THE ROAD TILL 1:00.

15:09.821 --> 15:10.779
AW.

15:10.822 --> 15:14.000
HEY.
HEY.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.178
CHATTY GAL.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.137
SHE'LL GET USED
TO THIS.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.965
I LOVE THIS.
OH, THIS?

15:23.009 --> 15:24.271
MM-HMM.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.186
SOMETHING I JUST
THREW ON.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.535
YOU KNOW WHAT I
WAS THINKING.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.972
MAYBE WE'D TRY THAT
NEW ITALIAN SPOT

15:30.016 --> 15:31.234
UNLESS YOU'RE
TOO TIRED.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.932
NONSENSE.
NO?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.281
JUST LET ME SETTLE IN
FOR A SECOND, HUH?

15:34.324 --> 15:36.283
OK.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.286
MM.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.500
OH, BE STILL.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.502
YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T
BE SO BAD IF YOU

16:21.545 --> 16:23.591
HAD CLEANED IT PROPERLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.636
YOU BIG BABY.

16:27.464 --> 16:31.338
SO...LET'S REVIEW.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.427
ON THE ONE HAND,
YOU HAVE

16:33.470 --> 16:35.298
A CASANOVA
CON ARTIST

16:35.342 --> 16:37.213
SWEEPING A MIDDLE-AGED
WOMAN OFF HER FEET

16:37.257 --> 16:39.041
WHILE EMPTYING HER
BANK ACCOUNTS.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.565
AND ON THE OTHER, WE HAD
A KILLER CARVING FACES OFF.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.568
YOU SAID THERE WERE
NO OTHER CASES.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.789
NOT AT FIRST UNTIL
PRENTISS REALIZED

16:47.832 --> 16:50.052
WE WERE LOOKING IN
THE WRONG PLACE.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.749
WE DIDN'T TAKE HIS
FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE

16:51.793 --> 16:53.055
INTO ACCOUNT.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.274
IT'S THE ARSON.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.102
AND THAT'S THE ELEMENT
WE OVERLOOKED

16:56.145 --> 16:57.538
FOR PREVIOUS MURDERS.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.756
BAE, HIT ME.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.716
PRENTISS: GARCIA, LOOK
INTO ACCIDENTAL FIRES

17:01.759 --> 17:03.500
IN TENNESSEE,
WHERE A MIDDLE-AGED
WOMAN WAS KILLED.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.111
HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA TASK ME

17:05.154 --> 17:08.114
WITH SOMETHING
BONE-CRUSHINGLY BLEAK
AND DEPRESSING.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.812
ACCIDENTS--MIDDLE-AGED.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.509
LIMIT THE SEARCH TO
WOMEN IN THEIR 50s

17:12.553 --> 17:14.120
WHO WERE DATING
A YOUNGER MAN.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.470
ENTERING COUGARVILLE. RAWR.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.472
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME
A HOT MINUTE

17:18.515 --> 17:21.214
TO HACK AND SLASH THROUGH
ALL THIS SOCIAL MEDIA.

17:21.257 --> 17:24.347
2, 3, 4, 5, 7 HITS,
STILL COUNTING.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.088
CON ARTISTS TYPICALLY
TARGET SOMEONE

17:26.132 --> 17:27.655
WITH A VOID
IN THEIR LIFE.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.092
SO WHAT MADE MONICA
AN OPTIMAL TARGET?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.833
HER SON LEFT FOR COLLEGE
LAST YEAR.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.487
SHE WAS LIVING ALONE.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.445
GARCIA, OF THOSE 7 WOMEN,
HOW MANY OF THEM HAD

17:35.489 --> 17:37.882
CHILDREN WHO MOVED OUT JUST
BEFORE THEY WERE KILLED?

17:37.926 --> 17:40.929
PUTTING ON MY
EMPTY NESTER FILTER.

17:42.496 --> 17:46.500
BOOM. CLARISSA CARNEY,
AGE 54.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.242
DIED IN A FIRE IN MEMPHIS
5 MONTHS AGO,

17:49.285 --> 17:52.419
TWO ADULT CHILDREN--
CLARE AND DAMIAN CARNEY.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.116
OK, LET'S BRING
THOSE KIDS IN HERE

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
AND SEE IF THEY
RECOGNIZE OUR UNSUB.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.511
CLARE: THAT'S HIM.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.861
HE DON'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.123
MOM CALLED HIM MIKE.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.431
SHE SAID HE WAS A GODSEND
AFTER OUR DAD DIED.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.389
A GODSEND. HOW EXACTLY?

18:06.433 --> 18:07.651
CLARE: HE WAS INTERESTED
IN ALL THE SAME THINGS

18:07.695 --> 18:09.088
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.480
TOOK HER ON TRIPS.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.481
WHICH SHE LOVED.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.179
BOUGHT HER ALL
KINDS OF GIFTS.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.919
NOTICE ANYTHING
STRANGE ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP?

18:14.963 --> 18:19.489
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
WHEN THEY GOT ENGAGED.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.100
IT WAS A LITTLE FAST.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.451
CLARE: AND THEN
HE DISAPPEARED
JUST AS FAST.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.626
HE PROPOSED,

18:25.669 --> 18:27.149
AND THEN
THE NEXT DAY,
THE FIRE HAPPENED.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.846
HE DIDN'T EVEN COME
TO THE FUNERAL.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.849
ALVEZ: DID HE HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR MOM'S BANK ACCOUNTS?

18:34.025 --> 18:35.853
NO. WHY?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.203
ARE YOU SURE?

18:37.246 --> 18:40.031
HE DIDN'T TRY TAKING
ANY MONEY FROM YOUR MOM?

18:40.075 --> 18:43.948
NO. IN FACT,
WE WERE SURPRISED

18:43.992 --> 18:46.429
AT HOW MUCH SHE LEFT US
IN THE WILL.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.127
IT WAS OVER
7 FIGURES.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.131
YOU SAID YOU HAD
A PICTURE OF HIM?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.135
SHE EMAILED THIS TO US

18:56.178 --> 18:58.137
WHEN THEY TOOK
A TRIP TO CHICAGO.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.356
ROSSI: WE LEARNED A LOT
FROM THE PHOTO.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.490
KRYSTALL: HE'S OLDER
IN THIS PICTURE.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.448
BEARD, DIFFERENT GLASSES,
DIFFERENT HAIR COLOR,

19:05.492 --> 19:07.276
DIFFERENT EYE COLOR,
WHICH MEANS HE'S

19:07.320 --> 19:09.191
WEARING COLORED CONTACTS.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.193
CON MEN KNOW HOW
TO CHANGE THEIR LOOK.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.499
WELL, NOT TO THIS LENGTH.

19:12.542 --> 19:15.110
TAKE A LOOK AT HIS
FIRST IDENTITY AGAIN

19:15.154 --> 19:16.459
WHEN HE WAS MAC.

19:16.503 --> 19:17.504
OK.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.419
IMAGINE SOMETHING WITH ME.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.899
IT'S NOT GONNA BE GROSS
OR SCARY, IS IT?

19:21.943 --> 19:24.772
NO. JUST CLOSE
YOUR EYES, LISTEN,

19:24.815 --> 19:27.296
AND PUT YOURSELF THERE.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.215
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER: CON MEN
ARE CREATURES OF HABIT,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.086
WHICH IS A NICE WAY OF
SAYING THEY'RE

19:35.130 --> 19:36.871
FUNDAMENTALLY LAZY.

19:36.914 --> 19:40.266
LIKE MOST PSYCHOPATHS,
THEY GET BORED EASILY.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.659
THEY CHANGE JUST ENOUGH
ABOUT THEIR APPEARANCE

19:42.703 --> 19:44.487
TO KEEP THEIR CON ALIVE.

19:44.531 --> 19:48.491
THIS GUY DID MORE THAN JUST
CHANGE HIS CLOTHES AND HAIR.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.493
BASED ON OUR INTERVIEWS,
WE LEARNED THAT HE

19:50.537 --> 19:52.887
ALTERED HIS MANNERISMS,
HIS BODY LANGUAGE,

19:52.930 --> 19:54.889
EVEN HIS ACCENT.

19:54.932 --> 19:57.108
YOU ARE SO DARN
BEAUTIFUL.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.851
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF,
MISTER. HA HA...

20:00.895 --> 20:02.505
OH, MY GOD.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.552
MAN: ♪ I SAID, WOW!

20:05.595 --> 20:10.121
♪ I SAID,
WOW ♪

20:13.777 --> 20:16.737
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER: NOW, A MAN
WHO CAN CHANGE THAT MUCH.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.305
HOW DO YOU THINK HE WOULD FEEL
ABOUT HIMSELF?

20:26.529 --> 20:29.445
SHH.

20:29.489 --> 20:33.449
HA HA! MM. MM.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.718
KRYSTALL, VOICE-OVER:
LIKE HE HAD NO IDENTITY...

20:45.592 --> 20:48.116
LIKE HE HAD
NO FACE.

20:51.337 --> 20:55.297
THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW
IT WAS TIME TO DELIVER
THE PROFILE.

20:55.341 --> 20:59.345
THE UNSUB WE'RE DEALING WITH
THINKS HE'S A CON MAN,

20:59.388 --> 21:03.349
BUT A CON MAN WOULDN'T LEAVE
MONEY IN THE BANK LIKE HE
DID WITH CLARISSA CARNEY.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.742
REID: THIS MAN IS
A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST
AND MISOGYNIST

21:05.786 --> 21:08.354
WHO FUNDAMENTALLY HATES
THE WOMEN HE TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.747
HE CAN'T REVEAL WHO HE
TRULY IS TO THEM,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.967
SO AT THE MOMENT
OF THEIR GREATEST
HAPPINESS,

21:13.010 --> 21:15.578
HE DESTROYS IT
AND TAKES THEIR FACE.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.755
NOW, A HATRED THIS SEVERE,
WHERE RAGE TRUMPS MONEY,

21:18.799 --> 21:21.192
INDICATES THAT OUR UNSUB HAS
A DAMAGED RELATIONSHIP

21:21.236 --> 21:24.848
WITH THE PRIMARY
FEMALE FIGURE IN HIS LIFE,
MOST LIKELY HIS MOTHER.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.372
WAIT. WHY HIS MOTHER?

21:26.415 --> 21:28.287
COULDN'T HE JUST BE SOME GUY
WITH A BROKEN HEART?

21:28.330 --> 21:30.289
SOMETHING MUST HAVE
HAPPENED DURING
HIS FORMATIVE YEARS

21:30.332 --> 21:32.334
TO PRODUCE THIS LEVEL
OF VIOLENCE.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.858
HE'S BEEN NURSING THIS ANGER
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:34.902 --> 21:38.297
THE TIME HE SPENDS
WITH HIS MARKS IS
OUR BEST LEAD RIGHT NOW,

21:38.340 --> 21:40.647
AND ALTHOUGH HE GOES
TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO HIDE HIS FACE,

21:40.690 --> 21:43.867
HE PROBABLY USES ALL
OR PART OF THE SAME
COVER STORY IN HIS CON.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.869
AND THE DETAILS
HE RECYCLES MIGHT

21:45.913 --> 21:47.480
BE HELPFUL TO
OUR INVESTIGATION.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.482
THERE MIGHT BE
SOME BREAD CRUMBS
IN THERE

21:49.525 --> 21:51.484
THAT HELP LEAD US
TO WHERE HE IS NOW.

21:51.527 --> 21:54.661
OR, MORE LIKELY,
THEY'LL TELL US WHO HE
WAS TO BEGIN WITH.

21:54.704 --> 21:58.578
KRYSTALL: OK, I KNOW
THIS PART FROM DEALING CARDS.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.798
EVERY BLUFF HAS
A TELL,

22:01.842 --> 22:05.759
AND THAT TELL IS
THE TRUTH SEEPING OUT.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.761
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.763
A CON MAN KEEPS
HIS STORY STRAIGHT

22:09.806 --> 22:12.156
BY DRAWING
FROM HIS OWN LIFE.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.986
BUT TO GET
THOSE DETAILS, WE NEEDED
TO FIND MORE VICTIMS.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.597
DID YOU FIND THEM?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.991
GARCIA DID, ONCE SHE
EXPANDED HER SEARCH
BEYOND STATE LINES.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.559
BUT AS WE WERE PULLING
THOSE FAMILIES,

22:23.603 --> 22:26.954
HE'D ALREADY MOVED ON
TO ANOTHER TARGET.

22:26.997 --> 22:31.741
OK, YOU TWO ARE JUST
THE CUTEST TEAM EVER.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.787
CAREFUL NOW.YES, MA'AM.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.794
DON'T LEAVE ME
HANGING.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.407
OK.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.410
TELL ME, WHAT DO I
HAVE TO DO TO GET
ON YOUR GOOD SIDE?

22:48.454 --> 22:50.760
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU COULD MAYBE EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO ME.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.414
WHAT?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.547
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
WITH HER?

22:54.590 --> 22:57.637
WELL, UH...

22:57.680 --> 23:00.466
HONESTLY, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.

23:00.509 --> 23:04.513
IT'S EARLY.
WE--WE JUST STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.299
LOOK...

23:08.343 --> 23:11.346
JUST DON'T
HURT HER, OK?

23:20.921 --> 23:23.532
KRYSTALL: HE DID
HURT HER, DIDN'T HE?

23:24.881 --> 23:26.492
YEAH.

23:28.494 --> 23:32.062
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED? I MEAN,
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

23:32.106 --> 23:35.022
WE GATHERED THAT
FROM INTERVIEWS
AFTER THE FACT.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.024
AND AS WE BROUGHT IN
THE FAMILIES,

23:37.067 --> 23:39.766
WE DRILLED DOWN ON
THE UNSUB'S BACK STORY,

23:39.809 --> 23:42.159
AND THAT'S HOW WE FOUND
A PATTERN.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.771
HE TOLD MY MOM HE WORKED
FOR A HIGH-POWERED
CONSULTANT FIRM

23:44.814 --> 23:46.773
AND TRAVELED ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.775
AND WHAT ABOUT WHERE
HE WAS FROM?

23:48.818 --> 23:50.777
DID HE EVER TELL YOU THAT?YEAH.

23:50.820 --> 23:54.781
HE SAID HE WAS FROM
ABERDEEN, MISSISSIPPI,
HIS HOMETOWN.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.261
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
ABERDEEN, MISSISSIPPI.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.917
HE TOLD A STORY ABOUT
HIS DAUGHTER. I THINK
HER NAME WAS GRACE.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.270
GRACE.
YEAH, SHE, UM,

24:06.314 --> 24:09.883
SHE WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD,
BACK IN ABERDEEN.

24:09.926 --> 24:13.626
YEAH, HE SAID
THAT GRACE DROWNED
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.019
YEAH, DROWNED
IN THE BATHTUB.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.022
AND THAT IT WAS
HIS MOTHER'S FAULT.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.634
CARL:
SHE LEFT GRACE ALONE.

24:21.677 --> 24:24.593
GRACE BUMPED HER HEAD
IN THE BATH AND DROWNED.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.596
YEAH, HE NEVER FORGAVE
HER AFTER THAT.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.991
PRENTISS:
SO LET'S ASSUME THAT PART
OF THE UNSUB'S STORY IS TRUE.

24:31.034 --> 24:34.473
LETTING HIS DAUGHTER DIE
COULD BE THE SOURCE OF
HIS RAGE TOWARD HIS MOTHER.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.693
WE PROFILED SOMETHING
IN HIS MORE FORMATIVE
YEARS, THOUGH.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.652
YOU KNOW, THE DROWNING
COULD BE THE CULMINATION
OF THE MOTHER'S

24:39.695 --> 24:41.697
LIFELONG NEGLECT
TOWARDS THE UNSUB.

24:41.741 --> 24:45.832
WELL, MOST GRANDMOTHERS
WOULD WATCH THEIR GRANDCHILD
LIKE A HAWK IN THE BATHTUB.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.834
YOU KNOW,
AS CONFIDENCE GAMES
GO, HIS STORY IS

24:47.877 --> 24:49.836
BOTH UTILITARIAN
AND ELEGANT;

24:49.879 --> 24:51.925
DROWNING GARNERS
INSTANT SYMPATHY
FROM HIS VICTIMS.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.317
HOW BIG IS ABERDEEN?

24:53.361 --> 24:55.058
IT'S ABOUT
5,000 RESIDENTS.
WHY?

24:55.102 --> 24:57.757
TOWN THAT SMALL,
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD

24:57.800 --> 24:59.976
TO FIND A RECORD OF
A TRAGEDY THAT BIG.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.762
ROSSI: BUT IN THIS
PARTICULAR INSTANCE, IT WAS.

25:02.805 --> 25:03.763
PRENTISS, ON PHONE:
ANY LUCK?

25:03.806 --> 25:04.764
SADLY, I TELL YOU NO.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.417
ABERDEEN IS A LITTLE
TOO SMALL.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.941
THE POLICE HAVEN'T
DIGITIZED THE RECORDS YET,

25:07.984 --> 25:09.812
LET ALONE ANYTHING
FROM THE EARLY AUGHTS.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.814
WE'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THEM BY HAND.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.337
I'LL SEND LUKE AND MATT.

25:13.381 --> 25:16.123
KRYSTALL: SO YOU DID
AND THAT'S HOW YOU
CAUGHT HIM, RIGHT?

25:18.168 --> 25:20.170
WHAT?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.565
DAVID, WHAT IS IT?

25:23.609 --> 25:26.568
WE WERE CLOSING IN
ON HIM,

25:26.612 --> 25:28.962
BUT THE WOMAN
HE WAS WITH--

25:29.005 --> 25:31.007
MARY...

25:32.618 --> 25:35.011
SHE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.579
MARY, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

25:37.623 --> 25:39.581
TO DESERVE A MEAL
THIS EXTRAORDINARY.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.930
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

25:40.974 --> 25:44.586
WELL, I WANTED TONIGHT
TO BE SPECIAL.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.110
SPECIAL?

25:47.154 --> 25:49.112
MM-HMM.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.115
LISTEN, BILL, UH,

25:52.159 --> 25:54.640
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.822
WHAT'S THAT?

26:02.865 --> 26:05.433
IT'S HAWAIIAN KOA WOOD.

26:05.476 --> 26:08.044
MARY: IT REMINDED ME
OF WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU
ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO KAUAI.

26:08.088 --> 26:12.440
WELL, I'VE BEEN SAVING UP
POINTS AND PAID SICK DAYS,

26:12.483 --> 26:17.314
ENOUGH FOR US
TO GO ON A MODEST
BUT EXTENDED HONEYMOON.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.145
HONEYMOON?

26:29.457 --> 26:32.199
I KNEW THAT YOU WERE
THE MAN I WANTED

26:32.242 --> 26:35.637
TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH
THE MOMENT WE MET.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.772
AND I KNOW THIS ISN'T
HOW IT'S DONE, BUT,

26:39.815 --> 26:41.774
BILL,

26:41.817 --> 26:44.385
WOULD YOU BE MY HUSBAND?

26:59.792 --> 27:01.184
MARY: OH.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.724
I LOVE HAWAII.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.380
NO!

27:30.997 --> 27:33.477
THAT POOR MOTHER
AND DAUGHTER.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.958
WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.311
YOU SAID YOU WERE
CLOSING IN ON HIM, AND...

27:41.355 --> 27:45.315
THE PATH WENT THROUGH
ABERDEEN, MISSISSIPPI.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.535
MATT AND LUKE WENT
DOWN THERE.

27:47.578 --> 27:51.974
ROSSI: IN AN ACCIDENTAL DEATH
LIKE THAT, WITNESSES CERTAINLY
WIND UP IN A POLICE REPORT.

27:52.018 --> 27:56.587
SO THEY LOOKED FOR SMALLER,
PETTY CRIMES HE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN BUSTED FOR.

27:58.198 --> 28:02.550
THEY SEARCHED
ARREST RECORDS FOR FRAUD.

28:02.593 --> 28:06.162
INSTEAD, FOUND ONE FOR BIGAMY.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.816
WHOA.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.210
OF COURSE.

28:10.253 --> 28:12.821
HE PROPOSED
WITH EVERY CRIME.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.780
I MEAN, HE'D LEAVE
A TRAIL.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.173
EXCEPT IT WASN'T
HIS RECORD.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.872
IT WAS
THE UNSUB'S MOTHER.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.833
ROBERTA LYNCH, 62.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.270
STARTING IN THE LATE SEVENTIES,
SHE HOPPED FROM SUITOR
TO SUITOR,

28:27.314 --> 28:29.664
GETTING THEM TO MARRY HER
AND THEN TAKING THEM
FOR ALL THEY'RE WORTH.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.840
AN ARREST IN 1991 REVEALED
SHE HAD A SON, EVERETT,

28:31.884 --> 28:34.147
WHO WAS PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE
TO THE CON SHE WAS BUSTED FOR.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.931
HAVING A CON WOMAN
FOR A MOTHER WOULD
HAVE INSTILLED

28:35.975 --> 28:38.325
THE NARCISSISM
AND MISOGYNY
THAT WE PROFILED.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.415
OK, THE PATH TO FINDING HIM
IS THROUGH HIS MOTHER.
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

28:41.458 --> 28:43.417
SOUTH MISSISSIPPI
STATE PRISON. SHE'S
DOING 25 TO LIFE

28:43.460 --> 28:45.114
FOR KILLING A BOYFRIEND
IN A DOMESTIC DISPUTE.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.813
SOUNDS LIKE THAT RUNS
IN THE FAMILY, ALSO.

28:47.856 --> 28:51.077
KRYSTALL:
I IMAGINE A CON WOMAN

28:51.120 --> 28:53.906
WOULD BE
PRETTY TIGHT-LIPPED.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.299
THAT WAS
OUR ASSUMPTION, TOO,

28:56.343 --> 29:00.347
BUT SHE WASN'T QUITE
WHAT WE EXPECTED.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.312
WE APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING
TO US, MRS. LYNCH.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.966
OH.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.928
MY DEGENERATE LAWYER
IS WHO TALKED ME INTO
THAT PLEA DEAL.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.321
NOW I'M STUCK
IN THIS BOX

29:18.365 --> 29:23.326
UNTIL I'LL BE...
SPORTIN' DEPENDS
UNDERNEATH THE JUMPSUIT.

29:25.111 --> 29:28.331
BUT IT ALSO MEANS
THAT I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.900
OH.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.426
SORRY. SO WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, BROWN EYES?

29:36.470 --> 29:38.428
MRS. LYNCH, WE, UH--

29:38.472 --> 29:41.431
OH, PLEASE.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.478
YOU GOT TO CALL
ME BOBBIE. HMM?

29:46.480 --> 29:49.831
BUT NOT YOU.
NOPE.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.834
YOU CALL ME
MS. LYNCH

29:52.878 --> 29:57.186
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A BAD, BAD BOY.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.842
I, UH, DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO THAT.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.802
HA! STILL GOT IT.

30:03.845 --> 30:04.977
BOBBIE,

30:05.020 --> 30:07.370
WE'RE HERE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT EVERETT.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.677
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.505
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

30:11.548 --> 30:15.117
THAT KID'S BEEN
IN THE WIND
SINCE HE WAS...

30:15.161 --> 30:18.120
22 OR...

30:18.164 --> 30:21.515
AND HE'S NEVER
REACHED OUT. HEH!

30:21.558 --> 30:25.127
HE NEVER EVEN CAME
TO VISIT ME.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.521
YOU TELL ME,
WHAT KIND OF SON

30:27.564 --> 30:30.132
TREATS HIS MAMA
THAT WAY?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.526
ESPECIALLY AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT I
TAUGHT HIM.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.354
WHAT DID YOU TEACH HIM?

30:34.397 --> 30:36.356
WELL, HE WAS
MY LITTLE SOLDIER.

30:36.399 --> 30:40.229
HE WAS...
MY PARTNER IN CRIME.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.971
WE WERE JUST
A COUPLE OF
ROLLING STONES,

30:43.015 --> 30:45.365
MAKING
OUR WAY ACROSS
THE BIBLE BELT.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.758
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR CONS, RIGHT?

30:49.804 --> 30:52.241
THAT'S RIGHT, MUSCLES.

30:52.285 --> 30:56.985
SEE, I WOULD FIND
SOME GULLIBLE SCHMO...

30:59.379 --> 31:04.253
AND I'D TELL HIM
HOW WE...

31:04.297 --> 31:08.997
I WAS THROWN OUT
ON THE STREET
WITH MY POOR KID.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.958
YOU KNOW, NOTHING
OPENS UP DOORS

31:13.001 --> 31:15.612
LIKE A BLUBBERING
7-YEAR-OLD,
I TELL YA. HA!

31:15.656 --> 31:18.398
THEY WOULD FALL ASS
OVER ELBOWS, JUST--

31:18.441 --> 31:22.271
AND THEN,
PRETTY SOON...

31:22.315 --> 31:23.925
THEY'D GET DOWN
ON ONE KNEE

31:23.969 --> 31:27.189
AND I WOULD JUST
TAKE 'EM FOR EVERY
LAST NICKEL.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.757
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.324
WHAT?

31:33.369 --> 31:36.329
WE'D LAUGH.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.941
OH, MY, WE WOULD
LAUGH SO MUCH JUST

31:39.985 --> 31:43.423
ABOUT THESE POOR,
HELPLESS CHUMPS. HA!

31:43.466 --> 31:45.816
WHERE DO YOU THINK EVERETT
MIGHT BE RIGHT NOW?

31:45.860 --> 31:48.428
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT NO IDEA.

31:48.471 --> 31:52.780
BUT--HEH!--GIVEN
THAT THE FEDS ARE
LOOKIN' FOR HIM,

31:52.823 --> 31:56.566
I SURMISE THAT HE'S
STILL RUNNIN' CONS,

31:56.610 --> 31:58.525
AND GUESS WHAT.

31:58.568 --> 32:01.093
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
CATCH HIM

32:01.136 --> 32:03.051
'CAUSE I TAUGHT HIM
EVERYTHING I KNOW,

32:03.095 --> 32:05.053
EVERYTHING,
AND THAT IS ENOUGH
TO KEEP HIM

32:05.097 --> 32:08.317
ALWAYS JUST OUT
OF YOUR REACH.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.929
HE'S KILLING
HIS MARKS NOW.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.540
ALVEZ: BUT WE THINK
HE'S DOING IT

32:13.583 --> 32:16.151
BECAUSE HE CAN'T
KILL YOU...

32:16.195 --> 32:19.154
AFTER WHAT YOU DID
TO GRACE.

32:19.198 --> 32:22.201
GRACE?YEAH, YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

32:22.244 --> 32:25.160
THE ONE YOU LET DROWN,
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING HER?

32:35.518 --> 32:39.914
TOOK AWAY MY UTENSILS,
JUST 'CAUSE I SHIVVED SOME
PRETTY BITCH LAST SUMMER.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.399
FORGIVE ME, AGENTS,
BUT...

32:46.442 --> 32:50.011
I THINK THAT I'VE
ANSWERED ENOUGH
OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.709
JAREAU: THE DETAIL
ABOUT THE DROWNING HIT
A NERVE WITH ROBERTA.

32:52.753 --> 32:56.452
WHICH SUGGESTS THERE'S
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF TRUTH
TO EVERETT'S BACK STORY.

32:56.496 --> 32:59.455
NOW, HE PUTS HIMSELF
IN THE SUBMISSIVE ROLE

32:59.499 --> 33:02.545
THAT HE AND HIS MOTHER
WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
IN HER CONS.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.547
SO EVERY TIME HE
GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE
WITH HIS VICTIMS,

33:04.591 --> 33:06.332
HE HEARS
HIS MOTHER'S LAUGHTER
RINGING IN HIS EARS.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.030
ROBERTA SAID
THAT SHE TAUGHT EVERETT
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.032
WHAT IF THERE'S
A PATTERN IN THAT?

33:11.076 --> 33:12.381
PRENTISS:
WHAT KIND OF PATTERN?

33:12.425 --> 33:14.340
FOLLOWING
HER TRAIL, MAYBE,
GOING TO THE CITIES

33:14.383 --> 33:17.691
WHERE HER CON WORKED,
THINKING HE CAN WORK
THE SAME MAGIC.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.693
HEY, ROSSI'S RIGHT.
ALL 3 OF EVERETT'S KILLS

33:19.736 --> 33:22.304
HAPPENED IN CITIES WHERE
HIS MOM CONNED A MAN:

33:22.348 --> 33:25.220
BIRMINGHAM, MEMPHIS,
NASHVILLE.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.875
HE'S EVEN MIRRORING
THE ORDER IN WHICH HIS
MOTHER VISITED EACH CITY.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.008
WHERE DID ROBERTA GO
AFTER NASHVILLE?
LITTLE ROCK.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.271
WELL, THAT'S GOT TO BE
WHERE HE IS NOW.

33:35.752 --> 33:38.320
I WAS GETTING LONELY.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

33:38.364 --> 33:40.540
WE THINK OUR UNSUB'S
NEXT TARGET LIVES
IN LITTLE ROCK.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.542
I NEED YOU
TO ASSEMBLE A POOL
OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS

33:42.585 --> 33:44.935
BASED ON OUR
VICTIMOLOGY--WOMEN
ROUGHLY 50 YEARS OLD,

33:44.979 --> 33:48.548
RECENT EMPTY-NESTERS.NO BOUT A DOUBT IT.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.724
JAREAU: LIMIT
YOUR SEARCH TO WOMEN
ON DATING WEBSITES,

33:50.767 --> 33:52.943
SPECIFICALLY THOSE
INTERESTED IN
GETTING MARRIED.

33:52.987 --> 33:56.817
OK, WOMEN IN LITTLE ROCK
LOOKING FOR...A LITTLE ROCK.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.862
PRENTISS: SEND US
THEIR DATING PROFILES
AND SOCIAL MEDIA.

33:58.906 --> 34:01.474
WE'LL WORK IT ON OUR END.YEAH, YEAH.

34:01.517 --> 34:05.173
KRYSTALL: THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN A LONG LIST
OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS.

34:05.217 --> 34:09.090
ROSSI: REID DOES HAVE A KNACK
OF FINDING THE BLACK CAT
IN THE COAL MINE.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.136
GOT HIM.

34:15.531 --> 34:19.187
AND THAT'S HOW YOU
CAUGHT HIM, FINALLY.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.582
NO, IT IS HOW WE
FOUND HIM,

34:22.625 --> 34:25.585
BUT WHAT WE
DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT
THE UNSUB'S MOTHER

34:25.628 --> 34:28.544
MADE A PHONE CALL
FROM THE PRISON
AFTER WE LEFT.

34:28.588 --> 34:29.545
TO HER SON.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.156
TO HER LAWYER,

34:31.199 --> 34:33.158
AND SINCE
THAT'S PRIVILEGED,
WE DON'T KNOW

34:33.201 --> 34:36.770
EXACTLY WHAT SHE
SAID, BUT WE CAN
HAZARD A GUESS.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.772
YOU TELL
THAT ROTTEN BASTARD

34:38.815 --> 34:42.384
THAT THE FBI IS
ON HIS ASS,

34:42.428 --> 34:44.778
AND HOW DARE HE,

34:44.821 --> 34:49.826
HOW DARE HE BRING
MY GRANDDAUGHTER
INTO HIS...

34:51.437 --> 34:53.874
AND THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.876
HE DID WHAT HE DID

34:55.919 --> 34:59.880
TO--TO POOR LITTLE GRACIE.
THAT'S NOT ON ME.

34:59.923 --> 35:03.492
ROSSI: BECAUSE OF THAT, WE LOST
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.929
SHE SAID WHAT?

35:08.149 --> 35:10.108
OK.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.633
I'M GONNA NEED
TO IMPROVISE
A LITTLE BIT,

35:13.676 --> 35:15.417
OK?

35:17.027 --> 35:19.639
SO HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.907
SO YOU WERE WALKING
INTO A TRAP.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.476
I...

35:30.519 --> 35:33.696
I CAN'T LEAVE
THIS NEXT PART TO
THE IMAGINATION.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.743
IT'S OK. JUST--
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.101
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER:
WE UNDERESTIMATED.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.801
KRYSTALL: UNDERESTIMATED WHAT?

36:01.550 --> 36:03.944
ROSSI: HOW MANY WOMEN HE KILLED.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.963
SO...

36:25.183 --> 36:27.489
WITH THOSE FIRST
3 VICTIMS...

36:27.533 --> 36:30.492
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER: WE WERE
BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.495
ONCE WE WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE,
WE HEARD HER SCREAMING.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.410
HELP! HELP ME!
UPSTAIRS.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.195
WE NEED TO CLEAR
THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.718
I'M WITH YOU. GO.KRYSTALL: WHO, THE MOTHER?

36:38.761 --> 36:41.938
ROSSI: THE DAUGHTER.PLEASE, YOU GOT TO HELP ME!

36:41.982 --> 36:43.984
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.247
HE TOOK HER!
YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!

36:46.291 --> 36:48.206
REID: NO SIGN OF HIM
OR MARY. LEWIS IS
WITH ROSSI AND SIMMONS.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.990
WHERE DID HE TAKE
YOUR MOM?

36:50.033 --> 36:51.992
THERE'S A BARN
IN THE WOODS OUT BACK!

36:52.035 --> 36:55.038
ROSSI, CHECK THE WOODS
BEHIND THE HOUSE.
LOOK FOR A BARN.

37:07.181 --> 37:08.530
WE GOT YOU.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.753
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THE FACES ARE HIS TROPHIES.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.755
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM
BEHIND IF--

37:15.798 --> 37:18.018
HE KNEW WE WERE COMING.PLEASE!

37:18.061 --> 37:19.976
YOU HAVE TO FIND HER!

37:20.020 --> 37:22.544
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE GONNA
FIND YOUR MOM. ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

37:22.588 --> 37:25.155
GRACE. I'M GRACE. PLEASE!
HE'S GONNA KILL HER!

37:25.199 --> 37:26.896
GRACE?

37:28.028 --> 37:30.509
DADDY!

37:32.337 --> 37:34.295
OH, MY GOD.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.341
SHE WAS HIS DAUGHTER?

37:36.384 --> 37:38.343
YES.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.997
MARY CULLEN DID HAVE
A COLLEGE-AGE DAUGHTER,

37:41.041 --> 37:43.043
BUT SHE WAS AT COLLEGE.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.828
GRACE NEVER DROWNED?
NO.

37:45.872 --> 37:49.876
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST
TIME HE BROUGHT HER IN
ON ONE OF HIS CONS.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.924
WE DIDN'T SEE IT,

37:54.968 --> 37:57.971
AND IT ALMOST GOT US
ALL KILLED.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.151
SIMMONS: FIND OUT WHERE
HE'S SHOOTING FROM!

38:11.941 --> 38:14.640
ROSSI: TAKE THE OTHER SIDE.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FLANK
HIM FROM BEHIND.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.076
YEAH.

39:03.428 --> 39:07.040
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER:
MY LAST THOUGHT WAS,
"DON'T BLACK OUT.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.695
IF YOU BLACK OUT,
YOU'RE DEAD."

39:14.700 --> 39:16.702
AND THEN I BLACKED OUT.

39:21.271 --> 39:25.232
WE SAVED MARY,
WE ARRESTED GRACE,

39:25.275 --> 39:27.582
BUT HE GOT AWAY.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.237
YOU'LL CATCH HIM.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.066
EXCEPT THIS GUY,
HE'S A CHAMELEON.

39:33.109 --> 39:37.287
HE COULD WALK UP TO ME
WITH A GUN IN HIS HAND AND
I'D NEVER SEE HIM COMING.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.246
THAT'S WHERE THIS
CAME FROM.

39:41.291 --> 39:45.252
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER:
HE LEFT ME A REMINDER
OF WHAT HE COULD DO.

39:45.295 --> 39:48.168
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN
MY FACE IF HE WANTED.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.170
HE DIDN'T.

39:50.213 --> 39:54.740
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU
LOSE ON THIS JOB.

39:54.783 --> 39:59.179
I GET IT, BUT THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME

39:59.222 --> 40:02.182
THAT I WAS BEATEN BY
SOMEONE YOUNGER, FASTER,

40:02.225 --> 40:04.358
STRONGER THAN I AM.

40:05.968 --> 40:10.320
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S
BEEN BOTHERING ME
ABOUT THIS CASE...

40:11.931 --> 40:14.281
THAT MAYBE I'M...

40:14.324 --> 40:17.893
JUST NOT AS GOOD
AS I ONCE WAS.

40:17.937 --> 40:22.898
MAYBE I'M A HALF A STEP
SLOWER, MAYBE...

40:22.942 --> 40:26.902
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BE OUT THERE

40:26.946 --> 40:30.340
BECAUSE NEXT TIME...

40:31.951 --> 40:34.954
NEXT TIME,
I WON'T WAKE UP.

40:36.390 --> 40:38.697
YOU LEFT
SOMETHING OUT.

40:38.740 --> 40:41.700
YOU DIDN'T SAY SMARTER

40:41.743 --> 40:44.703
BECAUSE HE ISN'T,

40:44.746 --> 40:47.488
AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
GONNA CATCH HIM

40:47.532 --> 40:50.491
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU
ALWAYS CATCH 'EM.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.581
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT LOST.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.455
HE LOST, TOO.

41:00.283 --> 41:03.591
AND EVEN I KNOW

41:03.635 --> 41:06.594
WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO NEXT.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.210
THANK YOU

41:14.254 --> 41:16.430
FOR LISTENING...

41:18.040 --> 41:20.390
FOR...

41:20.434 --> 41:23.437
FOR BEING HERE.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.052
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

41:30.096 --> 41:32.098
NO.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.320
I'VE GOT TO DO
THIS ONE ON MY OWN.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.522
LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
