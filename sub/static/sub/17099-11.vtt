00:54.192 --> 00:57.024
Horace, dearest, lunch is ready.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.115
Where are you?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.991
Would you like me to bring it to you?

01:02.111 --> 01:04.348
Horace?

01:15.606 --> 01:19.637
Oh, there you are. Are you napping?

01:21.468 --> 01:24.990
Wake up, Horace. I've
brought you your lunch.

01:25.110 --> 01:27.007
Horace?

01:27.220 --> 01:28.875
Horace?

01:29.547 --> 01:32.592
Horace! Oh!

01:37.278 --> 01:38.592
As you know,

01:38.618 --> 01:41.547
Inspector Brackenreid
has joined Mr. Pendrick

01:41.565 --> 01:45.078
in his quest to recover
a scientific formulation

01:45.092 --> 01:48.278
that could be of great
benefit to mankind.

01:48.314 --> 01:51.546
- Have we had word from them yet, sir?
- I received a postcard

01:51.561 --> 01:54.764
only yesterday from the Port of Havana.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.207
Apparently they're bound for Panama.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.904
He didn't go into great detail,

01:59.939 --> 02:03.642
but it's clear that his absence
will be of some duration.

02:03.762 --> 02:06.878
Accordingly, I have been appointed

02:06.913 --> 02:10.047
Acting Inspector until his return.

02:10.258 --> 02:11.693
To that end...

02:12.039 --> 02:14.752
Then do we refer to you
as Inspector or Detective?

02:14.788 --> 02:16.754
Or Acting Inspector?

02:16.790 --> 02:18.856
That would just sound silly, Henry.

02:18.892 --> 02:20.670
Why would it sound
silly? It's what he is.

02:20.698 --> 02:23.863
- Acting Ins...
- We can just stay with Detective.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.780
Please. Now, back to what I was saying.

02:26.793 --> 02:28.949
During the Inspector's absence,

02:28.953 --> 02:31.664
I will be making some organizational...

02:31.664 --> 02:33.119
changes...

02:34.199 --> 02:38.156
that I believe will make our operations

02:39.044 --> 02:41.037
run more effectively,

02:41.950 --> 02:44.732
starting with our filing system.

02:46.311 --> 02:48.867
But we can discuss that another time.

02:49.716 --> 02:51.904
Talk amongst yourselves.

02:56.024 --> 02:59.089
- Detective Watts.
- Ah, Detective.

03:00.515 --> 03:03.743
- Actually, it's Acting Inspector for the moment.
- Oh.

03:04.196 --> 03:06.955
Will you be wanting this office
then? I'm happy to take yours.

03:07.504 --> 03:11.327
- No, I'll be keeping my office. Thank you.
- Good, good.

03:11.339 --> 03:14.175
I prefer this one. Separate
entrance. Very handy.

03:17.443 --> 03:20.116
- Detective Watts...
- I was asked to vacate Station One.

03:20.236 --> 03:22.053
Personality issue.

03:22.104 --> 03:23.877
Mine, I suppose.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.035
Then I heard that by happy coincidence

03:26.058 --> 03:27.870
this space was available.

03:28.051 --> 03:29.513
Excuse me, sir.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.285
There's been a murder.

03:40.891 --> 03:42.556
Oh, my Horace.

03:42.676 --> 03:44.391
My dearest, dearest,

03:44.878 --> 03:48.680
my best and only companion.
The love of my life.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.104
How can this be?

03:52.616 --> 03:54.615
My Horace is dead.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.348
He's been murdered!

04:00.490 --> 04:01.796
Oh.

04:09.147 --> 04:12.392
Mrs. Frizzle, I understand
the death of your dog,

04:12.438 --> 04:14.646
must be a terrible loss.

04:15.751 --> 04:17.824
I offer you my condolences.

04:17.869 --> 04:19.863
He was my closest family.

04:21.108 --> 04:25.006
Nonetheless, it isn't
really within the purview of

04:25.034 --> 04:29.605
the Toronto Constabulary to
attend to the death of dogs.

04:29.633 --> 04:32.199
Is it possible your dog
died of natural causes?

04:32.250 --> 04:34.017
Absolutely not.

04:34.051 --> 04:35.830
He had just been thoroughly examined

04:35.835 --> 04:37.819
by the finest vet in the country.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.826
Right. Did Horace have
any enemies you know of?

04:40.837 --> 04:43.663
- George...
- The Toronto Dog Show is in two days.

04:44.303 --> 04:46.580
The owners of the dogs
nipping at Horace's heels

04:46.602 --> 04:49.802
for the championship would all have
loved to see him out of the running.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.017
Sir, that sounds like motive.

04:52.397 --> 04:54.011
Everyone knew that Horace

04:54.039 --> 04:56.755
was the odds-on favourite
to win Best Dog In Show.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.447
And the next stop was
the show of shows...

04:59.476 --> 05:02.681
Westminster at Madison Square
Garden in New York City.

05:02.738 --> 05:05.185
Excuse me.

05:06.103 --> 05:07.683
Hello.

05:08.430 --> 05:09.919
Yes, it is.

05:10.673 --> 05:12.496
I can't believe it.

05:12.757 --> 05:15.277
It's just so appallingly horrendous.

05:15.498 --> 05:16.597
George,

05:16.717 --> 05:19.258
this is not a murder. This is...

05:19.763 --> 05:22.318
- canicide.
- Exactly, sir.

05:22.341 --> 05:24.068
Like homicide or suicide.

05:24.079 --> 05:25.507
An unlawful killing.

05:25.524 --> 05:28.476
But there is no law against
the killing of an animal.

05:28.510 --> 05:31.626
You know that. Now, stay with her

05:31.699 --> 05:34.639
- and help her bury the dog.
- Bury him?

05:35.177 --> 05:36.859
Without a funeral?

05:40.003 --> 05:43.644
My caller wishes to
speak with you, Detective.

05:43.650 --> 05:44.760
With me?

05:46.963 --> 05:48.708
Detective Murdoch.

05:51.902 --> 05:53.510
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.849
No, I understand.

06:04.537 --> 06:05.902
George,

06:06.022 --> 06:08.275
see that the body

06:08.309 --> 06:10.625
is transported to the morgue.

06:10.857 --> 06:12.557
And find out everything you can

06:12.596 --> 06:15.497
- about the other competitors.
- Sir.

06:28.094 --> 06:29.378
You there.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.730
Ah, Detective Watts.

06:33.429 --> 06:36.471
Constable George Crabtree. We
worked together some time ago.

06:36.698 --> 06:39.258
Oh yes... eager fellow, weren't you?

06:39.558 --> 06:41.965
What does the Detective
have you working on today?

06:42.005 --> 06:44.707
Actually, I'm trying to
ascertain the killer of a dog.

06:44.741 --> 06:47.267
- A dog?
- A very important dog, mind you.

06:47.312 --> 06:51.028
And you're all engaged on this... case?

06:52.172 --> 06:54.644
You there. Can you read and write?

06:54.688 --> 06:56.288
Of course.

06:56.317 --> 06:59.393
Your demeanour suggested that might
not be the case. Do you have a name?

06:59.421 --> 07:02.570
- Does my demeanour suggest that I don't?
- Ho-ho.

07:02.593 --> 07:05.125
Very good. Backbone. Wit.

07:05.714 --> 07:07.385
With me, Constable.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.234
- Have you seen this?
- _

07:18.259 --> 07:19.726
I have.

07:20.525 --> 07:24.722
We should not be wasting valuable
police resources on a dog,

07:24.935 --> 07:26.731
regardless of its relationship

07:26.748 --> 07:29.143
to the sister-in-law of the Mayor.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.324
People like dogs, William.

07:31.913 --> 07:35.411
Now we add a little peroxide
of manganese to the solution.

07:40.649 --> 07:42.122
Eureka.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.867
The cause of death was
strychnine poisoning.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.956
So it appears you do
have a murder to solve.

07:48.841 --> 07:51.552
Canicide is not murder, Ms. James.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.540
Only humans can be murdered.

07:53.574 --> 07:57.074
Be that as it may, we also found
veronal in the dog's intestines.

07:57.194 --> 07:58.598
Meaning?

07:58.634 --> 08:01.355
Death by strychnine can be very painful.

08:01.475 --> 08:03.304
The veronal would have
eased the symptoms.

08:03.321 --> 08:05.121
As if the poisoner was attempting

08:05.138 --> 08:07.325
to minimize the dog's suffering.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.071
Maybe the dog killer
was also a dog lover.

08:10.258 --> 08:12.648
It's been suggested that
this may have been motivated

08:12.654 --> 08:14.670
by a dog competition.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.862
A rival dog owner, perhaps.

08:17.118 --> 08:20.294
I imagine the stud fees of a
champion must be quite high.

08:20.736 --> 08:22.922
Dogs were bred for a function.

08:23.042 --> 08:25.279
Not to be household pets

08:25.313 --> 08:27.510
or show animals of the rich.

08:27.782 --> 08:30.977
People of all classes
own dogs as pets, William.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.111
I believe they can be very beneficial

08:33.232 --> 08:35.900
to the health and
well-being of their owners.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.145
Hm.

08:37.563 --> 08:39.433
Have you anything else to report?

08:39.606 --> 08:42.270
Yes. In examining the
dog's stomach contents,

08:42.282 --> 08:45.193
we found a barely digested
piece of beef steak.

08:45.204 --> 08:47.345
Yes, I believe it was filet mignon.

08:47.547 --> 08:50.831
Filet mig... for a dog?

08:50.951 --> 08:52.703
That is ridiculous.

08:52.913 --> 08:55.439
- Do you have any idea what that would cost?
- Yes,

08:55.955 --> 08:58.509
but it does taste good.

08:58.629 --> 09:01.862
Anyway, that's all the
information we have for you.

09:01.879 --> 09:05.465
We have to finish up. The dog's
been requested for the funeral.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.229
I imagine you'll be attending.

09:13.994 --> 09:16.741
Thank you. I appreciate it.

09:19.516 --> 09:21.130
What have you, George?

09:21.147 --> 09:25.893
Sir. It's a who's who of the
Toronto canine competitive society.

09:26.955 --> 09:29.383
This is Sebastien Melrose.

09:29.419 --> 09:31.940
His dog, Kaiser, once
took Best in Breed.

09:31.976 --> 09:34.368
He also has some of second
and third place finishes

09:34.387 --> 09:35.678
in group categories.

09:36.828 --> 09:38.554
This gentleman is Buck Christopher,

09:38.595 --> 09:41.925
he's a sheep farmer, sir. He
just started showing his dog Duke.

09:42.045 --> 09:44.536
Some people question Duke's pedigree,

09:44.545 --> 09:47.236
but he's already charmed his
way into a couple of ribbons.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.129
Oh.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.095
Isn't that Ruth Newsome?

09:51.390 --> 09:53.576
Yes, sir. And her dog,

09:53.611 --> 09:55.119
who she's named Roger,

09:55.239 --> 09:56.776
after her late brother.

09:56.794 --> 09:59.214
Something of an unusual tribute.

09:59.744 --> 10:01.450
Thank you, dear friends,

10:01.486 --> 10:03.219
for being here

10:03.441 --> 10:06.254
on this unbearably sorrowful occasion.

10:07.328 --> 10:10.391
Horace Frizzel was my
beautiful, beautiful boy.

10:11.628 --> 10:14.116
Among his peers, he was a champion.

10:14.551 --> 10:16.766
And in every ring he entered,

10:17.174 --> 10:20.168
he would carry his one
hundred and fifty pounds

10:20.204 --> 10:22.637
with ease and grace.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.530
Now, Miss Newsome and Roger

10:26.543 --> 10:29.353
are new to the scene, sir, but they've
already picked up a couple of ribbons

10:29.380 --> 10:32.266
and are considered a real
threat by the other owners.

10:32.778 --> 10:35.727
... we won at Westminster
in New York City.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.627
George, which of these
dogs is likely to become

10:38.672 --> 10:41.263
- the new champion now?
- Sir, they're all strong entries,

10:41.286 --> 10:43.185
but the lead contender is not here.

10:43.627 --> 10:45.617
- Where is he?
- She.

10:45.876 --> 10:50.433
Pistachio, sir. A Labrador
Retriever of unequalled perfection.

10:50.438 --> 10:53.152
Or so I'm told. Her owner
is Beaumont Stoddard.

10:53.197 --> 10:57.193
I pray that his killer
will be found and punished.

10:57.963 --> 11:00.083
What more can be said

11:00.203 --> 11:02.490
of a creature so beautiful

11:02.884 --> 11:04.438
and noble...

11:06.079 --> 11:07.497
... and beloved?

11:09.541 --> 11:11.530
Actually sir, he's just arrived.

11:11.593 --> 11:13.139
Is that Beaumont Stoddard?

11:13.157 --> 11:16.505
The man walking Pistachio is
the trainer, Michael Dubois.

11:16.536 --> 11:18.376
Stoddard is the man just behind.

11:18.621 --> 11:20.488
- Good
- night, sweet prince,

11:20.669 --> 11:24.597
and may flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

11:28.612 --> 11:31.471
How dare you!

11:31.506 --> 11:34.444
I've come to pay my
respects to a great animal.

11:34.471 --> 11:36.597
- That you've killed!
- George.

11:36.717 --> 11:38.514
I understand you're grieving.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.986
Get out!

11:44.481 --> 11:46.053
Come, Pistachio.

11:47.630 --> 11:49.188
You too, Dubois.

11:49.223 --> 11:51.223
We know when we're not welcome.

11:58.346 --> 12:00.975
Beaumont Stoddard couldn't
stand the fact that

12:00.979 --> 12:04.541
Horace bested Pistachio
in every category.

12:04.661 --> 12:07.374
Surely some of the other
contenders felt the same way.

12:07.818 --> 12:10.881
- None who could have done this.
- How can you be sure?

12:11.434 --> 12:13.854
I have given this a lot of thought.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.915
Now, Kaiser is a great competitor,

12:17.098 --> 12:19.658
but his owner, Sebastien
Melrose, is a friend of mine.

12:19.676 --> 12:21.488
He never would have done such a thing.

12:21.534 --> 12:24.316
And what of the Basset Hound?

12:24.588 --> 12:26.011
Duke?

12:26.314 --> 12:28.299
That hound is an imposter.

12:28.419 --> 12:31.072
And his owner, Buck
Christopher, is a simpleton.

12:31.439 --> 12:36.110
He lacks the sophistication
to perpetrate a dog murder.

12:36.469 --> 12:38.689
- Ruth Newsome?
- Hmm...

12:39.065 --> 12:41.081
Roger has potential,

12:41.090 --> 12:43.874
but Ruth herself is
an ineffectual nitwit.

12:43.910 --> 12:44.891
No,

12:45.095 --> 12:46.962
Stoddard is the murderer.

12:47.297 --> 12:50.088
And now that terrible
man stands first in line

12:50.107 --> 12:51.751
to win the competition.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.426
What do you notice?

12:56.985 --> 12:59.002
They're all from different years,

12:59.672 --> 13:03.039
- but they describe similar circumstances.
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.159 --> 13:04.639
Read this one.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.227
"Maybelline. If you're
reading this, please come home.

13:10.258 --> 13:12.338
Your children miss you
and I've changed my ways."

13:12.356 --> 13:13.846
How many are like that?

13:15.409 --> 13:17.240
There's four from this year alone.

13:17.281 --> 13:19.339
Last year, six. Before that, four.

13:19.411 --> 13:20.834
Three in 1900.

13:21.813 --> 13:23.366
Women are leaving their families.

13:23.389 --> 13:27.263
A reasonable conclusion.
Except, look at 1899.

13:28.142 --> 13:30.833
No such advertisement. 1898, none.

13:30.883 --> 13:33.194
1897, none.

13:33.491 --> 13:35.749
You grasp the implications, Constable.

13:36.329 --> 13:38.273
- Indeed.
- A woman leaves her family,

13:38.309 --> 13:41.309
she goes somewhere else. To
her parents. To her sister.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.492
Word gets back, no need
to place an advertisement.

13:43.515 --> 13:45.998
But these woman have vanished.

13:46.396 --> 13:47.856
Kidnapped? Murdered?

13:47.924 --> 13:49.836
All I know is women are going missing.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.240
There's more every year.

13:51.820 --> 13:54.054
And it all began in 1900.

13:54.725 --> 13:56.878
And you'd like me to help you find them?

13:56.909 --> 13:58.024
Oh no.

13:58.047 --> 14:01.590
I want you to take notes.
I tend to lose mine.

14:03.035 --> 14:07.175
Or you could rejoin your
colleagues on their dog case.

14:07.996 --> 14:10.403
- I'll get my pen.
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.164 --> 14:40.356
Mr. Stoddard, a word?

14:40.401 --> 14:42.314
What can I do for you, Detective?

14:42.552 --> 14:45.690
I understand Mrs.
Frizzle's dog was poisoned.

14:45.713 --> 14:48.205
Yes, and Edith is convinced I did it.

14:48.324 --> 14:51.053
Frankly, with her for an
owner, it's entirely possible

14:51.065 --> 14:53.325
the poor creature took his own life.

14:54.548 --> 14:58.484
Do you know of any reason why she
would suspect you in particular?

14:58.530 --> 15:00.863
She's labouring under
the delusion that her dog

15:00.880 --> 15:02.597
stood in the way of my victory,

15:02.614 --> 15:06.007
when it's obvious that
Pistachio is the superior animal.

15:06.127 --> 15:09.207
That's not the way the judges saw it.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.936
That was last year,
before I hired Mr. Dubois.

15:25.534 --> 15:27.573
You believe it to be
strychnine poisoning?

15:27.618 --> 15:30.529
Given the symptoms you've
described, there seems little doubt.

15:31.215 --> 15:35.055
Although vomiting after
strychnine poisoning

15:35.073 --> 15:36.982
would be unusual, wouldn't it?

15:37.220 --> 15:39.072
I'll take the sample back to Miss James,

15:39.083 --> 15:41.518
- get her to analyze it at the morgue.
- Thank you.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.724
It was you. You did this!

15:44.844 --> 15:46.672
- Mr. Stoddard.
- I'll kill you.

15:46.729 --> 15:49.521
- I will kill you!
- Mr. Stoddard, that is quite enough.

15:49.538 --> 15:51.452
You are coming with me.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.795
This is an outrage! She is
the one who should be in here.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.897
I've done nothing wrong.

16:01.932 --> 16:04.229
You uttered a death
threat, Mr. Stoddard.

16:04.268 --> 16:08.003
- Where's Pistachio?
- She's been entrusted to the constabulary.

16:08.324 --> 16:11.807
You'd better take good care.
She has a tendency to wander.

16:16.044 --> 16:18.729
- Good girl, Pistachio.
- George.

16:18.740 --> 16:21.899
You and Henry will
need to mind the... dog

16:21.952 --> 16:25.587
- while Mr. Stoddard is in custody.
- Sir, when will that be?

16:26.002 --> 16:28.423
Once he's had a chance to calm down.

16:30.414 --> 16:32.577
She's taken a real shine to you, sir.

16:32.611 --> 16:35.919
You know, they say that a dog
can sense a true dog lover.

16:37.783 --> 16:39.584
Well, they are wrong.

16:39.704 --> 16:42.110
Shoo. Shoo.

16:48.114 --> 16:50.832
I think Pistachio might need
to take care of some business.

16:53.364 --> 16:55.732
- Where are we going, sir?
- Here.

16:57.396 --> 16:59.345
- Are these the missing women?
- Yes.

16:59.362 --> 17:01.174
With whatever details I've learned.

17:01.294 --> 17:03.400
What does this say?

17:04.159 --> 17:06.425
Lynn Clark, 40s, new to Toronto.

17:06.462 --> 17:08.271
You assured me that you could read.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.718
Those are all my notes, by
the way, so don't lose them.

17:13.636 --> 17:16.670
I've decided the best way to
approach this is to concentrate

17:16.704 --> 17:19.270
on one missing woman at
a time, starting with...

17:19.298 --> 17:21.762
Natalie Sykes. Twenty-six years old.

17:21.801 --> 17:23.789
Her family hasn't heard
from her since the fire.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.874
- Why her, sir?
- She's first on the list.

17:28.372 --> 17:30.541
Oh, right. That makes sense.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.668
My aunt Primrose and
Azalea are big dog lovers.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.741
I bet they never had any
of the breeds they have

17:35.758 --> 17:38.791
- at these high class dog shows.
- No, they're all mongrels.

17:38.826 --> 17:42.362
But it's said that mongrels
are not only smarter,

17:42.397 --> 17:44.628
but healthier than these purebreds.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.112
What is it?

17:46.502 --> 17:48.660
We might as well take a break.

17:49.464 --> 17:51.103
Oh.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.939
You thirsty, Pistachio? Come on.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.882
Come on, Pistachio.

18:00.378 --> 18:03.346
- That should be him there, sir.
- Mr. Harding?

18:04.138 --> 18:05.730
Who wants to know?

18:06.024 --> 18:08.086
It's my understanding
a Miss Natalie Sykes

18:08.092 --> 18:11.242
- lived across the hall from you earlier this year.
- For a time.

18:11.593 --> 18:13.479
When was the last time you saw her?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.460
- Early May.
- May?

18:15.466 --> 18:17.092
That was after the fire.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.850
Did you not know she was
reported missing in mid-April?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.288
She didn't look missing to me.

18:21.408 --> 18:23.463
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

18:23.894 --> 18:26.499
- Church.
- Church?

18:27.116 --> 18:28.583
Saint Stephen-in-the-Fields.

18:28.634 --> 18:30.219
That's where she was
heading when I last saw her.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.249
And weren't you concerned when
she didn't return from church?

18:33.470 --> 18:35.203
It was not my business.

18:37.847 --> 18:39.977
You said you read, Jackson.

18:40.027 --> 18:42.384
- Sir.
- Do you know the works of Karl Marx?

18:42.440 --> 18:45.777
- Can't say that I do.
- He said the more industry grows,

18:45.788 --> 18:48.031
the quicker it destroys community.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.257
He may be right.

18:54.352 --> 18:56.344
Do you think the Detective
will make us do more work

18:56.345 --> 18:57.682
than the Inspector did?

18:57.802 --> 19:00.479
He may implement some efficient systems.

19:00.689 --> 19:03.124
- So we may do less?
- Give it back!

19:03.141 --> 19:05.141
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.287
- What's the trouble here?
- Thank you.

19:07.627 --> 19:10.996
This barkeep has stolen my travel
journal, and it's irreplaceable.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.877
Travel journal? Where
are you travelling from?

19:13.103 --> 19:16.105
All across the country. I'm a historian,

19:16.292 --> 19:18.574
telling the true tale of this great land

19:18.603 --> 19:20.642
as her iconic birthday fast approaches.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.037
- Canada is having a birthday?
- Oh yes. Look at this.

19:25.646 --> 19:29.288
This is from an eleven-year-old
girl in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia.

19:29.362 --> 19:30.976
And this...

19:31.724 --> 19:34.352
a celebratory birthday
song from Newfoundland.

19:35.122 --> 19:38.073
- Newfoundland is not a part of Canada.
- Oh, it will be.

19:38.129 --> 19:40.299
Oh, really? When exactly
will this transpire?

19:40.310 --> 19:42.587
George... his irreplaceable book.

19:42.707 --> 19:45.504
When did you last see this book?
I'm sure it didn't just disappear.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.135
Well, I was sitting right here.

19:47.192 --> 19:49.639
I turned to admire that
lovely dog you have over there,

19:49.653 --> 19:51.020
who's no longer here, by the way.

19:51.071 --> 19:53.597
I turned back and
there was me book, gone.

19:54.096 --> 19:55.721
Pistachio!

20:03.826 --> 20:06.127
Why else was Edith at the dog show?

20:06.149 --> 20:09.137
It was revenge. An eye for an
eye. It's as simple as that.

20:09.315 --> 20:11.383
By poisoning your trainer?

20:11.503 --> 20:13.847
- My trainer?
- Mr. Dubois.

20:14.017 --> 20:17.416
Good God. I'd hardly be this
upset if she was after Dubois.

20:18.005 --> 20:19.648
After Horace was poisoned,

20:19.682 --> 20:21.398
Dubois wasn't taking any chances.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.794
He was eating Pistachio's food?

20:23.828 --> 20:26.184
It was his idea. He's very dedicated.

20:26.589 --> 20:29.338
- So the dog was the intended victim.
- Of course.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.073
That's why I find it so appalling.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.484
A self-confessed dog lover.

20:33.943 --> 20:36.897
Mrs. Frizzle did not
try to poison your dog.

20:36.933 --> 20:38.631
How do you know?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.864
The poison that was used was strychnine,

20:40.893 --> 20:42.835
the same that was used on Horace.

20:43.175 --> 20:46.822
I'm sure she sees it as ironic justice.

20:46.942 --> 20:49.683
She was never told
that it was strychnine.

20:49.803 --> 20:51.966
The same poison used in the same manner

20:51.989 --> 20:53.761
would suggest the same poisoner.

20:54.101 --> 20:56.079
Unless you believe that Mrs. Frizzel

20:56.107 --> 20:58.543
- poisoned her own dog...
- Who then?

20:59.818 --> 21:02.123
Who had access to your dog's food?

21:02.724 --> 21:04.848
Dubois buys meat from the local butcher

21:04.876 --> 21:06.655
who holds the highest standards.

21:06.689 --> 21:08.054
And where was it kept?

21:08.099 --> 21:09.878
In a crockery pot in the stall.

21:09.923 --> 21:11.786
Was it ever left unattended?

21:14.035 --> 21:16.119
During Pistachio's training run.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.881
Anybody could've had access.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.336
What time was that?

21:19.807 --> 21:21.414
Three o'clock, thereabouts.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.760
- George?
- Sir, I hate to tell you this...

21:25.797 --> 21:27.262
- Where's Pistachio?
- Well...

21:27.280 --> 21:28.654
Well, what? Where is she?

21:28.672 --> 21:30.584
We were breaking up
a disturbance at a bar

21:30.616 --> 21:32.551
- and we turned around...
- You jackasses!

21:32.569 --> 21:34.735
I told you she has a tendency to wander!

21:34.855 --> 21:37.781
- We'll find your dog, Mr. Stoddard.
- You are all useless.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.944
I'll find my dog and
the poisoner by myself.

21:44.455 --> 21:45.877
Sorry, sir.

21:46.190 --> 21:49.034
Get Constable Jackson
and get out there looking.

21:49.069 --> 21:51.328
- Jackson's not here, sir.
- Where is he?

21:51.501 --> 21:52.652
Detective Watts

21:52.688 --> 21:54.994
needed some help with a case.
Jackson's been working with him.

21:55.216 --> 21:56.452
Has he, now?

21:56.741 --> 21:59.007
Well, get other Constables
to help you look.

21:59.075 --> 22:02.419
- And don't come back without that dog!
- Sir.

22:03.248 --> 22:06.034
- Pistachio!
- Pistachio!

22:08.622 --> 22:10.004
Pistachio!

22:10.566 --> 22:12.101
Pistachio!

22:14.213 --> 22:15.927
Pistachio!

22:17.738 --> 22:19.872
Have you seen a golden retriever?

22:27.360 --> 22:29.934
I'm sorry. I didn't notice anyone

22:29.942 --> 22:32.743
at Pistachio's stall besides Mr. Dubois.

22:32.945 --> 22:35.539
And where were you during
Pistachio's training run?

22:36.278 --> 22:38.710
I was here with Kaiser all afternoon.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.554
Can anyone confirm this?

22:41.697 --> 22:42.952
I can.

22:43.509 --> 22:46.355
I was in the next stall
clipping Duke's toenails.

22:49.042 --> 22:51.427
- Miss Newsome.
- Oh, did you see Roger's run?

22:51.887 --> 22:53.629
- Yes...
- Isn't he something?

22:53.811 --> 22:56.653
My dear brother would be so proud.

22:57.068 --> 22:59.851
Indeed. Miss Newsome, I must ask,

23:00.047 --> 23:01.986
where were you at three o'clock?

23:02.262 --> 23:04.139
I was around here somewhere.

23:04.469 --> 23:07.568
I'm afraid I'll need you to
be more specific than that.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.576
Oh. Well, alright.

23:09.825 --> 23:13.309
- Three o'clock, I was with...
- Pistachio!

23:13.323 --> 23:15.289
No. Not Pistachio.

23:15.321 --> 23:17.763
Pistachio! Come back here!

23:28.529 --> 23:31.990
Do you have any idea of
the trouble you have caused,

23:32.207 --> 23:33.993
you unruly mutt?

23:35.130 --> 23:37.490
Half of Station House Number
Four is looking for you.

23:38.995 --> 23:40.123
Let's go.

23:40.799 --> 23:42.045
Stop that.

23:42.928 --> 23:45.438
Let go.

23:47.165 --> 23:48.583
What is it?

23:55.589 --> 23:56.830
Come.

24:00.328 --> 24:02.467
Pistachio, there's nothing out here.

24:12.092 --> 24:13.347
Oh...

24:15.055 --> 24:16.276
Good dog.

24:20.891 --> 24:22.635
When they body was brought in,

24:22.649 --> 24:25.445
the temperature had fallen
no more than seven degrees.

24:25.453 --> 24:27.641
Rigor mortis hadn't fully set in yet,

24:27.967 --> 24:32.149
so I'd estimate he died no more than
an hour before you discovered him.

24:32.382 --> 24:35.400
So shortly before I
arrived at the arena.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.777
Were you able to identify
the weapon that was used?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.407
The wound appears to be inflicted

24:40.429 --> 24:42.870
by a curved blade
about four inches long.

24:49.169 --> 24:51.644
As in a pair of grooming scissors.

24:54.713 --> 24:57.247
These are the only scissors in your kit?

24:57.477 --> 24:58.915
Yes.

24:59.782 --> 25:01.420
I distinctly recall seeing

25:01.433 --> 25:04.152
a pair of curved ones in
your possession yesterday.

25:05.619 --> 25:07.089
They seem to have gone missing.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.226
I see.

25:10.973 --> 25:12.514
And where were you between the hours

25:12.525 --> 25:14.858
of five and six PM last evening?

25:14.978 --> 25:17.615
I would have been on
my way to the arena with

25:17.735 --> 25:18.781
Kaiser.

25:19.122 --> 25:22.302
You blame Beaumont Stoddard
for the death of your dog.

25:22.329 --> 25:23.471
I do.

25:23.883 --> 25:25.057
I see.

25:25.809 --> 25:28.522
And you've brought none of the
grooming items as I requested.

25:28.536 --> 25:30.217
They were all buried with Horace,

25:30.249 --> 25:32.133
along with his favourite toys.

25:32.816 --> 25:35.396
I would never use those
things on another dog.

25:35.719 --> 25:38.019
Horace cannot be replaced.

25:39.111 --> 25:40.588
And where were you between the hours

25:40.616 --> 25:42.606
of five and six PM last evening?

25:42.767 --> 25:44.616
I was at Horace's graveside.

25:44.634 --> 25:47.112
My servants can confirm my whereabouts.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.304
How do you explain the fact

25:52.308 --> 25:55.069
that there are no scissors
in your grooming kit?

25:55.105 --> 25:57.143
I leave Duke's hair natural.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.975
I never use scissors at all. I just...

26:01.039 --> 26:03.906
brush him for the shine.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.954
Ooh! Here they are.

26:34.508 --> 26:37.597
So Ruth Newsome's scissors
were not the murder weapon, sir?

26:37.606 --> 26:40.554
Not unless she did a very
good job of cleaning them.

26:40.873 --> 26:43.874
- Ah, Detective Watts, a word.
- Of course.

26:43.994 --> 26:46.465
I agreed to let you work out
of Station House Number Four,

26:46.486 --> 26:49.282
- but there are limits.
- Have I done something to...

26:49.318 --> 26:52.022
It is not proper protocol
for you to commandeer

26:52.022 --> 26:54.511
one of my Constables without
checking with me first.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.405
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overstep...
- Next time, ask.

26:57.807 --> 27:00.277
- Mm-hmm.
- Sir.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.602
I'm wondering what to do with
Pistachio, now that her owner's dead.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.254
Can't her handler take her?

27:06.869 --> 27:10.042
I understand Mr. Dubois is still
recovering from his recent poisoning.

27:10.918 --> 27:13.541
Right. Then perhaps she could
stay with you for the night?

27:13.762 --> 27:16.951
Sir, I'd love to, but my
landlord no longer allows animals.

27:16.962 --> 27:19.465
Well then, I'm sure one of
the other owners can keep her

27:19.476 --> 27:21.414
until Mr. Dubois can reclaim her.

27:21.448 --> 27:23.809
Sir, one of the other owners
is likely the poisoner.

27:23.831 --> 27:25.502
We can hardly take that chance.

27:26.544 --> 27:27.941
Right.

27:28.061 --> 27:29.466
What are you suggesting?

27:30.330 --> 27:33.231
I believe your hotel allows pets, sir.

27:34.576 --> 27:37.130
They may. I do not.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.324
All right, I suppose
I'll stay here with her.

27:40.550 --> 27:41.615
Here?

27:41.683 --> 27:43.875
I'll bunk down in one
of the cells, I suppose.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.863
Very well.

27:46.072 --> 27:48.012
I won't get much sleep tonight, sir.

27:48.132 --> 27:50.247
I may not be at my best tomorrow.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.252
George.

28:00.394 --> 28:02.759
This way. This way.

28:05.123 --> 28:07.870
Pardon me. Pardon me. This way.

28:12.598 --> 28:15.158
Terribly sorry. This way.

28:18.991 --> 28:22.344
Oh, what a delight.
I've always wanted a dog.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.239
It's for one night only. Let's be clear.

28:25.261 --> 28:28.098
Mr. Dubois is released from
the hospital tomorrow morning.

28:28.110 --> 28:31.615
Oh. What a clever good girl you are!

28:32.039 --> 28:35.097
Hardly clever.

28:35.165 --> 28:37.426
Julia, Julia, if the dog
chews through the socks,

28:37.437 --> 28:39.233
they'll be no use to me anymore.

28:39.663 --> 28:42.744
- I'll buy you another pair.
- That's hardly the point.

28:43.758 --> 28:45.231
Be nice, William.

28:45.304 --> 28:47.467
Pistachio's been very
helpful to you so far.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.399
She may even help you
find your murderer.

28:49.750 --> 28:52.633
I think you overestimate
this dog's intelligence.

28:56.626 --> 28:58.947
I believe she wants you
to take her for a walk.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.216
No. Absolutely not.

29:18.547 --> 29:21.096
You know, I haven't
really stopped to think

29:21.130 --> 29:23.086
how this must be affecting you.

29:23.424 --> 29:25.202
Eh, Pistachio?

29:27.054 --> 29:29.710
Who do you think killed
your Mr. Stoddard?

29:45.756 --> 29:47.415
Hello.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.012
Well, you seem a lot calmer.

29:52.819 --> 29:55.045
Well, the walk was pleasant enough.

29:55.459 --> 29:58.081
But let's make one
thing perfectly clear:

29:58.370 --> 30:00.478
under no circumstances

30:00.598 --> 30:04.153
is that dog to be
allowed in that bedroom.

30:05.145 --> 30:06.651
No.

30:06.889 --> 30:10.084
You, Pistachio, will sleep

30:10.310 --> 30:12.712
on this bed.

30:12.832 --> 30:15.815
You lie down here.

30:17.356 --> 30:19.208
Come.

30:40.568 --> 30:42.629
Alright. We know the murder weapon to be

30:42.658 --> 30:44.963
a curved pair of grooming scissors,

30:44.997 --> 30:48.356
and three of our suspects have
been unable to produce theirs.

30:48.476 --> 30:52.039
Mr. Melrose claims that he has lost his.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.761
Mr. Christopher denies
ever owning a pair,

30:54.773 --> 30:57.513
and Mrs. Frizzel claims
that she's buried hers.

30:57.633 --> 30:59.513
She was probably telling the truth, sir.

30:59.564 --> 31:02.604
We dug up the dog Horace;
these were buried with him.

31:03.142 --> 31:05.311
- Oh.
- And the other contestants

31:05.345 --> 31:07.961
claim that Mr. Christopher took
pride in not cutting Duke's hair.

31:07.962 --> 31:10.900
- Bragged about it, in fact.
- Leaving Mr. Melrose with

31:10.929 --> 31:13.913
no scissors and no explanation
as to where they have gone.

31:13.930 --> 31:17.280
And sir, with Horace out
of the way, his dog Kaiser

31:17.316 --> 31:19.123
could possibly leap right to the top

31:19.151 --> 31:21.128
of the podium.

31:21.139 --> 31:22.403
Pistachio!

31:24.883 --> 31:27.557
- Why would she do that, sir?
- I have no idea.

31:27.593 --> 31:29.792
- What did you just say?
- I said...

31:30.247 --> 31:31.793
Kaiser could

31:31.838 --> 31:34.410
- leap to the...
- Pistachio!

31:37.077 --> 31:39.847
- Well-trained animal, sir.
- Detective,

31:39.898 --> 31:42.096
would you mind if I borrowed
Constable Jackson again?

31:42.107 --> 31:44.848
I'm sure he would leap at the chance.

31:45.092 --> 31:46.954
Alright, George. That's enough.

31:47.074 --> 31:49.853
Take this dog, and these.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.356
Come on, Pistachio.

31:53.291 --> 31:55.562
Detective, this case of yours...

31:55.573 --> 31:57.460
Cases, actually. Plural.

31:57.873 --> 32:01.289
- You believe there to be a connection?
- I don't know.

32:02.065 --> 32:04.659
You've of course considered
that these may be people

32:04.698 --> 32:06.686
- who don't wish to be found.
- I have.

32:06.698 --> 32:09.180
But I'm not sure I believe
that to be the case.

32:09.496 --> 32:11.405
Still, with no new evidence...

32:11.433 --> 32:13.030
That is what I am endeavouring to find.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.216
And as far as I'm concerned,
finding a missing person

32:15.239 --> 32:17.731
is of equal importance
to solving a murder.

32:17.737 --> 32:20.500
Are you saying you would rather
I didn't squander your resources?

32:20.557 --> 32:23.411
No, no. As long as you understand that

32:23.876 --> 32:25.981
there may not be a solution.

32:26.396 --> 32:28.627
I don't expect any of this to end well.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.252
But with murder, there is certainty.

32:31.288 --> 32:33.742
Without certainty, there's hope and...

32:34.224 --> 32:35.384
Well,

32:35.504 --> 32:37.316
hope can be a terrible thing.

32:39.116 --> 32:41.597
- Doctor.
- Detective Watts.

32:42.724 --> 32:44.231
William. I have something.

32:44.259 --> 32:46.474
When we further investigated
Mr. Stoddard's body,

32:46.485 --> 32:49.651
we discovered this in the
coagulated blood around his wound.

32:49.696 --> 32:51.090
A hair?

32:51.316 --> 32:52.749
The hair of a dog.

32:52.869 --> 32:55.315
And I believe I know
which dog it belongs to.

32:58.974 --> 33:01.081
Now, be careful with those.

33:02.318 --> 33:04.508
- Henry Higgins!
- Hello, Miss Newsome.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.830
How perfectly wonderful
to see you again!

33:06.859 --> 33:09.775
- I knew you'd come around.
- It's not like that.

33:09.895 --> 33:11.593
You don't have to play
shy with me, Henry.

33:11.604 --> 33:13.480
Come along. Perhaps we could
share a martini cocktail.

33:13.531 --> 33:15.615
It's not a social call.

33:15.735 --> 33:18.181
Oh. Then what did you
want to talk to me about?

33:18.793 --> 33:20.234
Ruth Newsome,

33:20.526 --> 33:21.620
you're wanted for questioning

33:21.620 --> 33:23.266
in the murder of Beaumont Stoddard.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.279
A strand of your dog's hair was found

33:29.284 --> 33:31.160
in Mr. Stoddard's wound.

33:31.183 --> 33:32.891
How do you explain that?

33:33.321 --> 33:34.916
I really can't say.

33:35.333 --> 33:38.476
I believe your grooming
scissors to be the murder weapon.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.996
You don't believe I
could do something so

33:41.260 --> 33:42.569
horrible?

33:42.814 --> 33:45.428
Yesterday, you showed
me a pair of scissors

33:45.442 --> 33:47.707
that were not unlike the ones used.

33:47.827 --> 33:51.129
Did you procure a second
pair to cover your tracks?

33:51.249 --> 33:52.620
Oh.

33:53.377 --> 33:55.080
Oh, this is rather embarrassing.

33:55.130 --> 33:58.864
I dropped my pair somewhere in the arena

33:58.891 --> 34:01.066
and Roger was in desperate
need of a little trim.

34:01.088 --> 34:02.398
I searched everywhere
but I couldn't find them,

34:02.402 --> 34:03.780
so I borrowed Sebastien's.

34:03.798 --> 34:06.558
I completely forgot that they
weren't mine when I brought them in.

34:06.617 --> 34:09.291
I hope I haven't caused
you boys too much trouble.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.496
Excuse me.

34:17.949 --> 34:21.385
Henry, please ask Mr.
Melrose if the scissors

34:21.407 --> 34:24.837
that Miss Newsome
surrendered are indeed his.

34:25.027 --> 34:27.878
Sir, I think Miss Newsome
may be telling the truth.

34:28.422 --> 34:30.859
She's not the sharpest tack in the box.

34:32.226 --> 34:36.297
Well, the case remains that her
scissors killed Mr. Stoddard.

34:37.556 --> 34:39.553
Are we really gonna charge her?

34:39.893 --> 34:42.156
She doesn't seem capable
of stabbing anyone.

34:47.062 --> 34:49.378
Miss Newsome, you're free to go.

34:49.391 --> 34:52.146
Oh, thank you. There's just
enough time for Roger and I

34:52.155 --> 34:53.963
to get ready for the
competition tonight.

34:54.083 --> 34:57.806
Now please remember, a
killer is still at large.

34:57.926 --> 34:59.740
Be mindful of your dog,

34:59.803 --> 35:01.756
and also of yourself.

35:01.876 --> 35:04.644
Perhaps Constable Higgins
could accompany me home?

35:05.802 --> 35:07.347
Absolutely.

35:08.244 --> 35:09.500
Come on.

35:10.388 --> 35:12.522
- Let's go.
- Uh...

35:13.940 --> 35:15.689
Do you remember Miss Sykes?

35:16.047 --> 35:18.871
She was one of a dozen or so homeless

35:18.885 --> 35:20.737
who stayed here after the fire.

35:21.689 --> 35:23.588
Did you know that she'd
been reported missing?

35:23.610 --> 35:24.969
That she had a family that was

35:24.987 --> 35:26.604
desperately seeking her out?

35:26.613 --> 35:28.688
- I had no idea.
- She's still missing.

35:28.869 --> 35:30.383
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:30.410 --> 35:32.104
When was the last time you saw her?

35:32.224 --> 35:34.216
Sometime mid-May.

35:34.270 --> 35:35.820
- Where was this?
- On the street.

35:35.847 --> 35:37.538
She was walking with a woman.

35:37.601 --> 35:38.675
What woman?

35:38.702 --> 35:40.284
I don't know her name,

35:40.537 --> 35:43.351
- but I'd seen her before in the church.
- Describe her?

35:43.868 --> 35:45.169
Tall,

35:45.215 --> 35:47.887
maybe in her forties.

35:48.435 --> 35:49.669
Blonde?

35:50.366 --> 35:51.422
Yes.

35:52.849 --> 35:55.250
Thank you. Would you
mind coming to the station

35:55.255 --> 35:57.402
- to assist with a sketch?
- Certainly,

35:57.683 --> 35:59.228
after Mass.

36:00.176 --> 36:01.734
My notes. Where are they?

36:01.752 --> 36:03.714
Sir, I transcribed them.

36:03.834 --> 36:05.041
Brilliant.

36:05.358 --> 36:06.931
Let me see here.

36:09.256 --> 36:11.303
Lynn Clark. Last seen in the company

36:11.317 --> 36:14.606
of a tall blonde woman
in her middle years.

36:14.726 --> 36:17.370
- We have our first suspect, Jackson.
- And it's a woman.

36:17.860 --> 36:20.827
Sugar and spice and everything nice.

36:21.172 --> 36:24.371
- Excuse me, sir?
- I always wondered how they came up with that.

36:24.491 --> 36:26.143
Never believed it myself.

36:29.936 --> 36:32.908
So Ruth Newsome took
Mr. Melrose's scissors

36:32.940 --> 36:35.677
without asking, which is
why he didn't have them

36:35.686 --> 36:37.155
and didn't know where they were.

36:37.275 --> 36:40.086
And a hair from Miss Newsome's
dog was found in the wound,

36:40.458 --> 36:42.479
making her actual scissors

36:42.506 --> 36:44.287
almost certainly the murder weapon.

36:44.541 --> 36:46.294
Somebody else could have picked them up.

36:48.673 --> 36:52.044
Perhaps Mr. Stoddard
discovered who the poisoner was,

36:52.250 --> 36:54.644
confronted him,
threatened to expose him.

36:54.672 --> 36:57.902
The poisoner then followed Mr. Stoddard,

36:58.142 --> 37:00.390
picked up Miss Newsome's scissors,

37:00.440 --> 37:03.404
once they were out of
the arena, stabbed him.

37:03.524 --> 37:06.140
So that would mean the dog poisoner

37:06.260 --> 37:07.598
and Stoddard's murderer

37:07.621 --> 37:09.343
- are one and the same.
- Exactly.

37:12.442 --> 37:15.403
Pistachio looks to have made
herself quite comfortable.

37:15.439 --> 37:18.422
Mr. Dubois. Glad to see
you've made a full recovery.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.162
Well, not full, but

37:20.282 --> 37:22.422
hopefully well enough
to keep up with Pistachio

37:22.440 --> 37:24.162
on the course tonight.

37:24.282 --> 37:25.603
Pistachio, come!

37:32.604 --> 37:36.339
Oh, we won't be needing any
of those items. Just the leash.

37:37.612 --> 37:39.773
Oh, right.

37:40.131 --> 37:41.798
Have you determined

37:41.821 --> 37:44.630
- who poisoned Pistachio's food?
- Not yet.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.706
And Mr. Stoddard's murder?

37:47.227 --> 37:49.017
Unsolved, unfortunately.

37:49.546 --> 37:51.585
Well, Godspeed,

37:51.621 --> 37:55.175
and thank you for taking such
good care of her, Detective.

37:55.702 --> 37:57.773
It was no trouble at all.

37:59.912 --> 38:01.720
Take care, Pistachio.

38:02.128 --> 38:03.854
You be a good dog now.

38:03.974 --> 38:05.585
She always is.

38:05.925 --> 38:08.553
Thank you again. And good-day to you.

38:08.673 --> 38:10.910
Good luck with the competition tonight.

38:23.963 --> 38:25.087
Sir.

38:25.780 --> 38:27.978
You must be a little sad to see her go.

38:29.177 --> 38:30.465
Not in the least.

38:30.497 --> 38:32.540
Now that she's back
in proper hands, we can

38:32.803 --> 38:35.603
concentrate on more important things.

38:37.914 --> 38:40.994
Right. There are two
possibilities, George.

38:41.323 --> 38:43.720
The killer and the poisoner
are one and the same,

38:43.720 --> 38:45.324
or they are not.

38:45.559 --> 38:47.734
But either way, we know for certain

38:47.739 --> 38:49.173
that both of these crimes are connected

38:49.178 --> 38:50.695
to this competition.

38:50.770 --> 38:52.713
Well, Pistachio and Kaiser

38:52.740 --> 38:55.200
are the two main contenders
for Best Dog In Show,

38:55.218 --> 38:58.064
with Roger and Duke
following closely behind.

38:58.405 --> 39:00.705
Maybe the perpetrator will
make another attempt today.

39:03.433 --> 39:06.441
And now to the bulldogs,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:18.172 --> 39:21.534
Particularly handsome group
this year, as you can see.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.779
Beautiful breed.

39:29.214 --> 39:31.764
You are distracting the dogs, Detective.

39:31.777 --> 39:34.673
This area is designated
as a calming area for dogs

39:34.695 --> 39:37.921
- and handlers only.
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Dubois,

39:37.935 --> 39:39.829
but it is necessary that I be here.

39:39.851 --> 39:43.345
- I'm on police business.
- Nonetheless. Come.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.632
Thank you to the bulldogs.

39:48.654 --> 39:51.030
And now we have the hounds.

39:52.054 --> 39:53.598
First up is Duke,

39:53.718 --> 39:55.193
a three-year-old Basset Hound.

39:55.229 --> 39:56.806
Weighs in at sixty pounds,

39:56.824 --> 39:58.895
height at shoulder fourteen inches.

39:59.015 --> 40:01.714
Owner and handler Buck Christopher.

40:13.272 --> 40:14.953
What in the blazes?!

40:14.984 --> 40:16.045
What are you doing?

40:16.126 --> 40:18.985
I was returning this
undercoat rake I had borrowed.

40:19.293 --> 40:21.124
With permission.

40:24.558 --> 40:26.575
- Julia.
- William.

40:27.064 --> 40:30.126
Miss James made a discovery that
could have some bearing on this case.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.566
- What is it?
- She analyzed Mr. Dubois's stomach emissions

40:33.580 --> 40:36.040
and found that, along with a
minuscule amount of strychnine,

40:36.058 --> 40:38.232
there was a large quantity of ipecac.

40:38.613 --> 40:40.896
- Ipecac.
- Yes, it's an emetic.

40:41.096 --> 40:42.808
It would have caused
the vomiting, ensuring

40:42.835 --> 40:45.544
that he didn't die from
the strychnine he consumed.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.769
So what you're saying is...

40:47.800 --> 40:49.930
Mr. Dubois was never actually in danger.

40:50.224 --> 40:52.879
He was trying to throw
suspicion off of himself.

40:52.916 --> 40:55.571
Thank you to the hounds.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.583
Mr. Dubois, stop right there!

40:59.071 --> 41:00.432
It was you!

41:00.552 --> 41:02.639
You poisoned Mrs. Frizzel's dog.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.575
- I did no such thing.
- I believe you did.

41:06.024 --> 41:08.373
And I also believe you
killed Mr. Stoddard.

41:08.493 --> 41:11.053
- You have no proof of that.
- I have enough.

41:11.112 --> 41:13.024
- Oh, my goodness!
- Mr. Dubois.

41:13.196 --> 41:15.158
- Stand back.
- Let her go.

41:15.278 --> 41:17.676
- You're coming with me.
- I don't think so.

41:18.927 --> 41:21.636
Pistachio! Leap!

41:28.886 --> 41:32.193
You stay.

41:37.014 --> 41:38.006
Good girl.

41:49.861 --> 41:51.315
Sit.

41:53.014 --> 41:55.216
Mr. Dubois killed Horace,

41:55.412 --> 41:58.058
motivated simply by a desire to win.

41:58.117 --> 41:59.840
But why kill Mr. Stoddard?

42:00.334 --> 42:03.890
Mr. Stoddard discovered who was
responsible for the poisonings.

42:04.010 --> 42:07.746
As competitive as he was, he
believed in playing by the rules.

42:07.905 --> 42:09.808
He confronted Mr. Dubois,

42:09.813 --> 42:11.358
threatened to expose him

42:11.576 --> 42:12.844
and was killed for it.

42:13.755 --> 42:16.514
It's a shame Pistachio
won't get to compete,

42:16.559 --> 42:19.060
after all her training and hard work.

42:22.291 --> 42:23.645
Oh no.

42:24.158 --> 42:27.428
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

42:28.012 --> 42:29.694
No.

42:33.103 --> 42:35.590
Owner Miss Ruth Newsome

42:35.710 --> 42:41.343
and her very distinguished American
Staffordshire Terrier, Roger.

42:42.391 --> 42:45.127
Looking fine, Miss Newsome.

42:45.247 --> 42:47.460
Of course the dog will need a new home.

42:47.675 --> 42:51.215
It just, it seems a little soon.

42:51.288 --> 42:53.072
- I know.
- Mr. Sebastien Melrose

42:53.118 --> 42:56.171
and his English Setter, Kaiser.

42:57.615 --> 43:00.465
But do remember that Mr. Dubois

43:00.505 --> 43:03.501
is the villain in all
of this, not Pistachio.

43:03.621 --> 43:06.860
And finally, Pistachio,
the Labrador Retriever,

43:06.877 --> 43:08.621
squired by novice trainer

43:08.649 --> 43:12.082
- Detective William Murdoch.
- Oh!!

43:26.536 --> 43:27.856
Sir.

43:27.919 --> 43:29.414
Still looking for your travel journal?

43:29.454 --> 43:31.691
Well, the trail has gone cold,

43:32.070 --> 43:34.019
but I am not one to give up.

43:38.329 --> 43:40.459
The CN Tower.

43:40.646 --> 43:42.442
Looks like a spaceship on a stick.

43:42.488 --> 43:44.974
Once the world's tallest
free-standing structure

43:44.974 --> 43:46.758
built right here at Front and John.

43:46.826 --> 43:49.279
You, my friend, have
a vivid imagination.

43:49.399 --> 43:52.481
I didn't dream this stuff up.
Now I must stay the course.

43:52.485 --> 43:54.303
Canada is turning one hundred and fifty

43:54.365 --> 43:57.123
and I am not gonna miss the party.

44:00.018 --> 44:01.196
Did he say Canada's turning

44:01.219 --> 44:03.043
- one hundred and fifty?
- He did.

44:04.305 --> 44:10.358
