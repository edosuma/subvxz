00:20.200 --> 00:22.120
Another one.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.240
Perhaps the ancestors used it
for astronomical calculation.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.320
The settlement must be nearby.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.240
(thud)

00:57.480 --> 00:59.480
- Chevron four locked.
- Report.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.960
Sir, we've just got our first hit
with the cold-address program. P2X-416.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.240
Prepare the MALP.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.120
We must leave, Nyan.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.320
Nyan, you'll drown!

01:40.160 --> 01:42.480
It doesn't feel like water.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.040
What's up?

02:00.200 --> 02:04.320
Cold-dialling program made
a positive hit on P2X-416.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.760
I wonder why.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.360
Locals must have found the Stargate
since the computer last dialled.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.440
See, that's what I don't understand.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.320
- How does a computer know to do that?
- It doesn't, sir.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.480
I created the software to redial
cartouche Stargate addresses...

02:19.640 --> 02:23.720
..that hadn't connected the first time.
This is our first hit.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.800
Oh.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.200
Receiving MALP telemetry... now.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.040
Nyan, what is it?

02:41.200 --> 02:43.120
I don't know.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.560
Can you, uh... Can you follow him?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.280
Hello, Nyan.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.360
Don't be afraid.
My name is Daniel Jackson.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.160
- Are you a mechanical life form?
- No.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.320
I'm communicating with you
through that device.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.520
- From where?
- From anotherplanet.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.520
- It's a trick. We must report this, Nyan.
- No, not yet.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.280
Why?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.960
Sir, request permission to visit P2X-416.

03:27.120 --> 03:31.000
- Wait a minute.
- Jack, they're obviously intelligent.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.160
Judging from their clothes and tools,
they are close to our level of technology.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.160
And has anyone seen a DHD
in this transmission?

03:45.080 --> 03:47.000
He's right.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.600
Take a naqahdah reactor with you so you
can power up the gate and dial manually.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.480
All right.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.240
Mallin, I think we've found the gateway.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.640
There is no gateway.
That is Optrican legend.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.240
Well then, how do you explain this?

04:15.320 --> 04:18.040
This could be very dangerous, Nyan.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.760
Do you realise what this would mean?

04:26.200 --> 04:29.720
It would mean we were wrong
and the Optricans were right.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.080
Nyan, is it all right if we visit you?

04:32.240 --> 04:33.600
- No.
- Yes.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.200
OK, we'll be with you shortly.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.000
Try to stay close to that mechanical
device I'm speaking through.

04:40.160 --> 04:45.320
And try to avoid that big splash that
you saw before. It's kinda dangerous.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.720
We will be waiting here
to welcome you, Daniel.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.680
Mallin, come back!

04:51.840 --> 04:55.360
If you tell them, they might
kill whoever comes through!

04:55.520 --> 04:57.440
Mallin!

06:27.920 --> 06:30.160
Hello, Nyan.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.720
You're human.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.120
Yes.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.920
I'm Daniel Jackson,
the person you were talking to before.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.440
This is Major Carter,
Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.040
We're from a planet called Earth.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.120
You all right?

06:49.280 --> 06:51.320
Then the legend is true.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.720
What legend is that?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.800
The Optricans believe humans
were brought here by aliens,...

06:58.960 --> 07:01.080
..who travelled through a gateway.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.120
But during the Upheaval it was buried

07:03.280 --> 07:05.520
and they could no longer come through.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.240
What was the Upheaval?

07:07.400 --> 07:10.720
A period of violent earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions...

07:10.880 --> 07:14.480
..covering most of this continent,
about 2,000 years ago.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.760
If the Stargate's been buried for that long,
how did you know where to look for it?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.680
I was not looking for it.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.360
I was hoping to find a primitive settlement
that was here before the Upheaval.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.400
I was hoping to prove
the Bedrosian theory.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.680
What's that?

07:30.840 --> 07:35.200
That human life was created on Bedrosia,
without a gateway.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.400
- So this country is called Bedrosia?
- This continent.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.920
And then who are the Optricans?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.800
A rival continent.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.600
Rival, as in... what?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.560
We believe we were
created on this continent.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.400
The Optricans believe that
their holy gateway is on this continent.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.760
Therefore we've been at war for decades.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.640
OK. Carter, you wanna make sure
the reactor's all hooked up, just in case?

08:02.800 --> 08:06.160
Mind if I ask how close
to the front lines we might be?

08:06.320 --> 08:09.160
A great distance.
There's no need for concern.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.360
Mm-hm.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.360
(aircraft approach)

08:26.480 --> 08:28.200
O'Neill!

08:31.720 --> 08:33.400
(Nyan) Oh, no. No!

08:33.559 --> 08:36.679
- Come. We have to hide.
- You said they weren't around here.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.600
Those are not Optrican.
They're my people - Bedrosian.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.080
- Good guys?
- Good is not the word I would use...

08:43.240 --> 08:45.240
..to describe the ones that approach.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.160
- We must run. Now.
- OK. Carter, dial it up!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.560
We need five minutes
to be operational, sir.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.560
This way. Quickly!

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
Screw it. Let's go. Come on.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.360
Would you believe... we come in peace?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.280
Got a commanding officer around here?

10:01.320 --> 10:03.040
Wow. Tough crowd.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.720
What happened to Nyan?

10:06.880 --> 10:10.160
I'd imagine he's savin'
his own butt right about now.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.640
(twig snaps)

10:34.520 --> 10:36.440
(footsteps)

11:01.520 --> 11:03.440
Mallin!

11:08.400 --> 11:11.080
- You said there were aliens here.
- Yes, sir.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.600
- They came through the gateway.
- No, they didn't.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.520
It's a trick. A contrivance.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.320
Perhaps, but one of those aliens,
named Daniel,...

11:21.480 --> 11:25.960
..he talked to Nyan through that machine
that came through the circle.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.080
The shuttlecraft will take you to my base.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.160
We will question you
on this matter further.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.120
Either this Nyan fired at my craft,
or another Optrican is out there.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.200
- Either way, I want them found.
- Yes, sir.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.040
OK, that's a needle.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.640
Ow!

12:18.640 --> 12:21.480
- Which of you is Daniel?
- I'm in command.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.680
Colonel Jack O'Neill here.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.200
I'm unfamiliar with
that Optrican designation.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.920
We're not Optrican.
We're from another planet.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.640
We travelled through the Stargate.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.960
This type of psychological warfare,...

12:35.120 --> 12:39.280
..simulating the Optrican gateway fallacy
to undermine our most basic beliefs,...

12:39.440 --> 12:43.560
- ..will not work.
- Yeah, I know that it's hard to believe.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.320
So why not let us show you
how the Stargate works?

12:47.440 --> 12:52.960
If you're still not convinced, we'll just
take our stuff and go. Fair enough?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.400
Erect a quarantine field.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.080
Hey!

13:17.400 --> 13:19.760
State your purpose.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.240
Nyan.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.280
(growls)

13:29.840 --> 13:31.560
(shuttlecraft engine)

13:33.640 --> 13:37.200
- We have to get away from here.
- Where are my friends?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.320
Captured.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.560
- I will not leave my friends.
- We can't get to them.

13:42.720 --> 13:48.200
Rigar set up a quarantine field, and as
soon as he finds the soldier you killed...

14:04.720 --> 14:06.400
You're blind!

14:26.360 --> 14:29.560
- They were starting to dig here.
- Finish for them.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.040
I wanna know what's in there.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.800
I have the results from the blood analysis.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.120
There's 98% correspondence.
They are definitely human.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.040
But none of them match
the Bedrosian Central Registry.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.360
Then that proves they're Optrican.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.720
Does it not?

15:00.280 --> 15:02.440
Say what you were thinking.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.640
What if they're telling the truth? What if it
is a gateway and the Optricans are right?

15:06.800 --> 15:09.120
- No! It's a lie.
- But how can you be sure?

15:09.280 --> 15:14.320
I am sure because we have not spent our
lives praying to a god who does not exist.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.840
And many of our people have not died
fighting a meaningless war.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.080
I won't accept that.

15:20.240 --> 15:24.280
I've studied the book of Nefertum
word for word, cover to cover.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.480
- It is the truth.
- What if it's not?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.560
It is the truth.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.880
We began here.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.840
That device is a fabrication,
to fake the Optrican gateway myth.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.360
- To what end?
- To sow the seeds of doubt among us.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.840
To create dissension from within.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.440
I will not allow our people to have
their faith attacked in such a cynical way.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.840
What do you wanna do?

15:56.200 --> 15:59.840
We will not allow the events that
have transpired to leave this place.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.080
Then we must find this Nyan
and the fourth... Optrican.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.760
Yes. And we'll find out what we can
from the three we have in custody.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.560
Then we will dispose of them.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.680
Yes, sir.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.600
We come here for shelter.
We also store supplies here.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.120
- Are you injured in addition to your eyes?
- I will be fine.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.320
You could sit here.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.040
Here.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.720
It's water.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.960
It's amazing how one discovery
can change everything.

16:57.120 --> 17:02.640
I've been searching for proof that we were
created on this continent by Nefertum.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.520
Nefertum?

17:05.319 --> 17:07.560
The Blue Lotus Blossom of Ra.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.599
He's represented in our texts
by a blue lotus blossom.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.079
But what is "Ra"?
And how do you know about Nefertum?

17:16.520 --> 17:20.440
Nefertum was an under-System Lord
to the one named Ra,...

17:20.599 --> 17:22.720
..with whom I did battle.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.319
I don't understand.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.040
Nefertum was and is
the creator of all of us.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.520
- He created this planet and this continent.
- Correction:

17:32.680 --> 17:36.200
..Nefertum was an alien who
most likely brought you as slaves...

17:36.360 --> 17:38.320
..many thousands of years ago.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.400
That is what the Optricans say.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.560
Then they are correct.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.440
Oh, dear Nefertum, this is blasphemy.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.480
But if it is true,
then it could change everything.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.480
I must show my colleagues
at the academy.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.720
Can you be certain they will believe you?

17:57.880 --> 18:02.080
They are scientists. They will realise
they are wrong when shown the evidence.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.840
Your military has
the Stargate in its command.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.720
Not the gateway. You.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.320
- You are the proof.
- I will not be the proof!

18:11.480 --> 18:15.400
And I will not allow my friends
to be imprisoned as they are.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.560
You must help me rescue them.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.160
- Let me see.
- Do not!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.400
You could have a serious injury.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.240
I will be fine.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.200
I have something to help.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.320
- I'll bring it back with the other supplies.
- Nyan...

18:34.480 --> 18:36.160
Nyan!

19:01.960 --> 19:03.880
All right!

19:04.960 --> 19:06.880
That hurts.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.360
Well, this day just keeps
getting better and better(!)

19:15.480 --> 19:17.200
Yeah.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.880
(rocks crumble)

20:07.160 --> 20:09.520
- We should talk.
- Yes.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.680
Let us talk about your friend in the woods.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.280
I have no friends,
in the woods or otherwise.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.360
We're not spies.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.520
We're peaceful explorers.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.160
We travelled through
what you call your gateway.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.400
Fine, the Stargate, then.
But that's what we came through.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.360
- All four of you?
- All three of us.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.000
It is impossible to go to other planets,
much less through a circle of stone.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.280
The Stargate isn't made of regular stone.

20:38.440 --> 20:43.080
Given enough power, a wormhole forms
that allows us to travel to other worlds.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.440
- Wormhole?
- Giant worms. Huge.

20:47.800 --> 20:52.240
"Wormhole" is just an expression.
It has nothing to do with worms.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.760
It's a tunnel through space.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.840
How was this illusion of water
created that was described?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.640
You're right in that it is an illusion.
It's not water.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.360
- Then what is it?
- Magic.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.160
An event horizon, made up of
quantum particles that form a wormhole.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.040
An alien race, the Goa'uld,...

21:10.840 --> 21:15.760
..used the Stargate to transport
humans from Earth to other planets,...

21:16.520 --> 21:19.120
..which is how your people
came to be on Bedrosia.

21:24.200 --> 21:29.120
My people began on Bedrosia, as did
yours. We were all created by Nefertum.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.360
Nefertum?

21:31.520 --> 21:36.640
Son of Sakmet? Blue Lotus Blossom?
That's who you believe created you?

21:36.800 --> 21:39.040
- Yes.
- Well, he must have been a Goa'uld.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.000
A what?

21:41.160 --> 21:45.640
An alien. He must have transported
your people through the Stargate...

21:53.080 --> 21:55.000
Optrican fallacy!

21:56.280 --> 21:58.480
Return them to the prison tent.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.800
What are you doing?

22:08.920 --> 22:11.640
- You're an alien.
- Come no further.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.000
- Daniel said you were all human.
- Speak of it no more.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.240
- What are you?
- As I have said,...

22:24.000 --> 22:26.120
..speak of it no more.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.200
I did not believe you would return.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.720
You are the most important thing
that has ever happened to my planet,...

22:39.880 --> 22:43.120
..although I have not yet decided
if it is a good thing or bad.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.960
I've brought something for your eyes.

22:47.120 --> 22:52.600
It is a healing device that, among other
things, can regenerate the visual nerves.

22:52.760 --> 22:56.120
It will help most of your sight
return within a day.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.520
Of course, it was designed for humans,
so how you will respond...

22:59.680 --> 23:03.680
I have no need for it.
My sight will return on its own.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.680
Because you're an alien?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.440
The others are human.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.640
I am a Jaffa.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.920
And I possess within me
a symbiote that accelerates healing.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.240
Forgive me, but you do not
appear to be healing at all.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.960
My symbiote was severely damaged
by my own staff-weapon blast.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.240
It must first heal itself.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.400
- How long will that take?
- It could be days.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.080
Might it not die itself?

23:42.280 --> 23:44.200
It is possible.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.560
And if that happens?

23:51.720 --> 23:53.640
Then I too will die.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.000
Problem?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.640
Move!

24:28.720 --> 24:30.440
Explain.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.640
- Explain!
- I can't.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.080
There is a fourth! He did this!

24:38.920 --> 24:42.240
No, there isn't.
I don't know how this man was killed.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.840
Explain this.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.560
What do your people
intend to do with my friends?

25:01.720 --> 25:05.440
They are evidence that everything
my people believe in is wrong.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.440
That everything
the enemy believes is right.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.640
And that is not an easy thing
for military minds to digest.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.120
Then they will kill my friends,...

25:14.280 --> 25:18.080
..destroy the Stargate
and deny this event ever occurred.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.560
Probably.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.480
We must soon depart.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.360
- To do what?
- Rescue them.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.440
- You're still blind.
- I will manage.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.040
- Nyan!
- You will?

25:41.240 --> 25:43.840
I will not be part of a suicide mission.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.680
This device only works within 30 hours.
Do you want my help or not?

25:48.840 --> 25:53.360
You wish to use me to further your
scientific aspirations, do you not?

25:55.320 --> 26:00.440
- You are proof my theories are wrong.
- You would be better off if I were dead.

26:02.680 --> 26:06.040
Teal'c, I'm a scientist.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.360
If I find evidence my theories are wrong,
it's as exciting as if they were correct.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.160
Scientific advance in either direction
is still an advance.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.720
You sound like Daniel Jackson.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.960
Do what you can.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.360
The pain is the nerve regenerating.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.400
Only a moment.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.960
When I was out, I went to a place
where I could see Rigar's camp.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.040
Your friends are still there. Rigar's men
have dug up a smaller device...

26:50.200 --> 26:53.320
- ..that looks related to the gateway.
- The DHD.

26:54.360 --> 26:58.480
Perhaps circumstances
have become more favourable.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.400
There.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.400
There! I see a light there!

27:12.360 --> 27:15.880
Yes. Good. Then it works on your kind.

27:16.040 --> 27:19.920
- But I can only see a faint light.
- That was only the first treatment.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.320
We'll do it as many times as necessary.
There's no guarantee, but it should help.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.040
- Then do it.
- We must wait between treatments,...

27:28.200 --> 27:30.920
..or we will do damage rather than good.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.920
Daniel, are you OK?

27:56.760 --> 28:00.480
Hey, Rigar, you know that
"we come in peace" business?

28:01.320 --> 28:02.960
Bite me.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.000
You have one last chance.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.760
I don't know how that man was killed.
We are not Optrican spies.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.320
Is there another of your people out there?

28:21.480 --> 28:24.800
I don't know how that man was killed.
We are not...

28:27.240 --> 28:30.640
- There is not another one of us out there!
- What's he look like?

28:30.800 --> 28:34.320
- Turn it off! You'll kill him!
- No, you will kill him.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.200
- (door opens)
- Commander Rigar!

29:34.840 --> 29:36.880
Chevron seven locked.
Wormhole engaged.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.280
Ready to transmit signal, sir.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.200
SG-1 ...

29:55.680 --> 29:58.000
This is General Hammond. Come in.

29:59.400 --> 30:03.400
I repeat: SG-1, this is
General Hammond. Come in.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.720
- It is a gateway.
- This is not the gateway. It is a trick!

30:10.960 --> 30:12.880
Rigar, sir!

30:13.320 --> 30:15.440
SG-1, please respond.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.640
SG-1, please come in.

30:22.920 --> 30:26.320
- Who is this?
- This is General Hammond of the SGC.

30:26.480 --> 30:29.840
- With whom am I speaking?
- (Rigar) The one who holds yourpeople.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.720
- I want to speak with Colonel O'Neill now.
- You will speak with me.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.560
Almost there.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.720
Our objective is to free
O'Neill and the others,...

30:50.880 --> 30:54.240
..who will lay down cover fire
to let one of them dial the Stargate.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.760
Getting inside the camp is a problem. The
field is only penetrable by shuttlecraft.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.840
An obstacle easily overcome.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.080
My vision is improved. Thank you, Nyan.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.040
You may use this to defend yourself.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.880
- I've never used a weapon before.
- I am confident you will learn quickly.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.240
We must depart.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.080
Tell me... How does this trick work?
ls it some sort of projection?

31:44.440 --> 31:47.080
I assure you, what you are seeing is real.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.320
Now please let me speak
to Colonel O'Neill.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.800
Try to pull up the MALP.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.640
From where do you broadcast? Are you
in Optrica, or within Bedrosian borders?

32:01.200 --> 32:04.480
Once mypeople are returned,
I will be happy to discuss...

32:04.640 --> 32:07.360
..an exchange of information with you.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.720
See if you can get a clear
line of sight on O'Neill.

32:17.840 --> 32:22.840
You will send the plans for this device
and the coordinates of your position.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.520
When you have exposed your fraud, I will
consider sparing your operatives' lives.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.880
You will return mypeople immediately.
Is that clear?

32:55.400 --> 32:57.800
Do we understand each other?

33:01.560 --> 33:06.680
I assure you, if you attempt
any sort of rescue, I will kill your people.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.880
- We've lost all MALP telemetry, sir.
- Shut it down.

33:27.480 --> 33:32.520
Call in a transport shuttle. I want
them moved to a more secure facility.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.040
Put them away until it gets here.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.840
Are you sure I should
be the one to do this?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.760
You will perform well. I am certain.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.000
Stun, don't kill.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.640
Transport shuttle
will be here in a moment, sir.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.360
I will accompany the prisoners to base.
You will remain here to guard the ring.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.360
(shuttlecraft)

35:28.080 --> 35:29.680
Help me! Help me!

35:31.200 --> 35:33.520
He's out there, in the forest!

35:34.200 --> 35:35.760
- Who is out there?
- The alien.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.200
He killed the soldier
and he tried to kill me.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.400
But I got away and I came here.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.640
Take the shuttlecraft! Find him!

35:47.280 --> 35:49.200
Put him under guard!

35:54.080 --> 35:56.760
- Tell them to launch. Now!
- Yes, sir.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.080
Why haven't you launched this craft?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.320
Nyan!

36:40.680 --> 36:42.840
Hit the side button to shoot long range.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.920
- Where's Teal'c?
- He's outside.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.320
Daniel, dial us up. We'll lay down cover.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.080
- Unidentified traveller.
- Close the iris.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.800
I'm not receiving a GDO code, sir.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.920
- It's SG-1 , sir.
- Open the iris.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.080
Go!

38:09.200 --> 38:10.920
Carter! Go!

38:16.040 --> 38:19.440
- Nyan, can you cover me?
- I will.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.680
Teal'c!

38:35.920 --> 38:37.640
Look a little rough there, Teal'c.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.720
We gotta go.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.320
All right? Go!

39:01.320 --> 39:03.800
- Teal'c!
- He's coming with us, O'Neill.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.000
(alarm)

39:14.160 --> 39:17.560
- General Hammond, he's a friend.
- Stand down!

39:17.720 --> 39:19.640
A little help here!

39:40.280 --> 39:44.200
Well, Teal'c, all I can say is that
Junior is a resilient little guy.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.600
Who is Junior?

39:46.760 --> 39:49.400
It is the name Colonel O'Neill
has given my symbiote.

39:49.560 --> 39:53.560
- So how are you feeling?
- Greatly improved, thank you.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.800
Here's some good news. The air force
has agreed to get you refugee status.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.480
Which means you can stay here
on Earth... with us... if you'd like.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
What would I do here?

40:05.600 --> 40:08.960
We've got a little job for you,
Nyan, if you're interested.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.960
I have a backlog of artefacts
from previous missions...

40:12.120 --> 40:14.680
..and I could really use
a research assistant.

40:14.800 --> 40:19.520
It'd also be a great way to learn
about the history of your ancestors.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.880
But, for now, you both need to rest.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.200
And we'll leave you to that.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
Thank you, Teal'c.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.320
You have saved my life,
as well as the lives of my friends.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.800
It is I who should thank you.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.920
I wish I could have shown you
to the science community.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.960
They would have been fascinated.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.960
Perhaps one day the situation
on your planet will improve...

41:01.120 --> 41:03.440
..and you will get that opportunity.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.440
