I'm pro-bullying, but...

00:03.546 --> 00:05.715
- At what point does
the anti-bullying campaign

00:05.840 --> 00:07.425
just start bullying
the cool kids? Right.

00:07.550 --> 00:08.593

That's what I'm saying.

00:08.718 --> 00:09.760
- Yeah.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.640

It's closing,

00:28.487 --> 00:30.740
so I tried to rescue my koi fish
friends from their pond,

00:30.865 --> 00:33.326
but something's gone
really wrong.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.536
I gotta give 'em
mouth-to-gill.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.954

Did P.F. die?

00:37.079 --> 00:39.123
Oh, man.
He was, like, an old dude.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.292
I hope one of the other Changs
takes it over.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.960
Maybe Michael?
- Oh, cool, yeah.

Oh.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.306
Why are you killing
my friends?

Wait.

I'm not surprised.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.159
I always had Alice pegged
as a size queen.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.786

she's always

04:03.911 --> 04:05.871

at me like...

04:05.996 --> 04:07.289
- Mm-mm, what?

04:07.414 --> 04:08.624
- 'Cause size queens,
they can smell

04:08.749 --> 04:10.334

a mile away, baby.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.837

- Yeah, especially
from miles away.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.631

she's not gonna let us

'Cause the water boy took away
her deep dickin'.

04:25.808 --> 04:29.061
So all I've gotta do is
give her my dick deep,

such a K-word.

I was joking.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.922

I picked you?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.508
'Cause you and I,
we got the same problem.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.176
- You have a big one too?
- No-no.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.179
No, no, no, no,
upwards of four times smaller.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.932
It's, like, the size
of a little LEGO man.

for my mop.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.523
And I embrace that.
It's fine.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.026
And you, you have
this crazy huge dong.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.987
You could tie it
in a knot twice,

16:27.112 --> 16:29.155
and it would still be longer
than what I've got.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.782
- Yeah.
- That's you, man.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.075
- I guess
I always believed

16:32.200 --> 16:33.410
that I was meant
for something more

16:33.535 --> 16:35.078
than just
my big package.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.913
- You're not,
and that's a stupid attitude.

but a walking, talking penis.

right?

16:40.292 --> 16:41.334
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.378
There's a little blind spot
over there, though.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.796
- You know what?
It might actually be better

16:44.921 --> 16:46.923
'cause the shadows will, like,
play off our abs and stuff.

Yeah, a little shadow play.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.970
I'll look pretty cut
when I'm knocking you out.

Are you kidding?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.307
We better empty
our pockets, man.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.976

I don't wanna break my phone.
