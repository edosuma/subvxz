02:01.496 --> 02:03.749
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.377
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.922
Come on' what is that?
Where's the love?

02:10.047 --> 02:12.007
How are you feeling?

02:12.174 --> 02:15.093
I guess you're feeling like shit'
right about now.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.428
You can't...

02:16.720 --> 02:18.722
You can't move too good, huh?

02:18.889 --> 02:22.017
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

02:22.184 --> 02:24.394
Wait' wait, wait' wait!
What is this?

02:26.438 --> 02:28.106
Oh' fuck!

02:28.273 --> 02:31.527
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.029
Hold on' check this out.

02:39.284 --> 02:43.247
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

02:43.539 --> 02:46.583
I must be the motherfucking genius of sick!

02:46.750 --> 02:52.589
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep?
That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.

02:52.756 --> 02:57.803
You knocked this dude out pretty good!
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son.

02:58.053 --> 03:01.139
Maybe you
don't understand what just happened.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.268
I just fucking killed you.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.397
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

03:08.730 --> 03:11.567
This shit here I gave you!
This is some...

03:11.775 --> 03:15.779
high-tech' sci-fi,
Chinese synthetic bullshit!

03:15.946 --> 03:19.116
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

03:19.283 --> 03:23.787
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

03:23.954 --> 03:26.832
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me it's binded.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.961
Yeah' you got yourself about an hour' max.
Tick-tock.

03:31.336 --> 03:35.340
Yeah, baby... sexy...
Oh' it's been real.

03:35.507 --> 03:40.095
This shit's been real. You should've thought
twice before you whacked Don Kim.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.142
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

03:45.309 --> 03:46.977
I thought so.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.190
Now' you have yourself a nice death.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.611
Asshole!

04:01.825 --> 04:04.536
You like that' huh?
Home run!

05:02.010 --> 05:05.848
What do you think you're doing?
You can't just walk on my car!

05:06.014 --> 05:09.601
What do you think you're doing'
motherfucker' walking on my car?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.963
<i>It's Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.</i>

05:38.463 --> 05:42.801
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

05:42.968 --> 05:46.722
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:51.476
Get a cell phone' honey.
Please?

05:55.647 --> 05:57.441
Come on.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.942
Come on.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.739
Dr' Miles office' may I help you?
- Yeah' let me speak to him.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.451
<i>I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
May I take a message?</i>

06:07.659 --> 06:10.245
Where is he?
- I beg your pardon' sir?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.247
Where the fuck is he?

06:12.414 --> 06:13.832
No... yeah!

06:17.753 --> 06:19.129
Wow!

06:23.133 --> 06:24.843
Where you from?

06:25.469 --> 06:28.430
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.808
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to page him?</i>

06:31.975 --> 06:33.352
Yeah, fine.

06:33.477 --> 06:37.481
Please let the doctor know
that Chev Chelios is a dead man,

06:37.648 --> 06:42.027
if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

06:42.194 --> 06:45.781
<i>Yeah' D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.</i>

06:45.948 --> 06:47.866
Thank you.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.744
Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

07:32.911 --> 07:36.874
What's up' Chev?
- I said' where were you last night?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.084
I...

07:48.260 --> 07:50.929
<i>Well, want to know what I was doing?
- What?</i>

07:51.221 --> 07:53.223
Getting killed' you plum.
- What?

07:53.515 --> 07:57.227
Yeah' you heard me.
Ricky fuckin' Verona...

07:57.394 --> 07:59.354
<i>Ricky Verona?
- Who'd a thought...</i>

07:59.521 --> 08:03.025
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

08:03.233 --> 08:07.196
<i>I mean, it's inconceivable. Yet, here we are.
- Where are we?</i>

08:07.362 --> 08:12.868
I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen to me.
Put the word out I'm looking for Verona.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.288
<i>Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I...</i>

08:16.455 --> 08:20.125
I'm gonna get that little fucker
if it's the last thing I do.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.629
It may actually be the last thing I do.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.714
You understand?
- Ricky Verona.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.424
<i>You copy?
- Yeah.</i>

08:27.758 --> 08:29.801
Find him!

08:55.786 --> 08:57.913
Hey, man!

08:59.122 --> 09:02.668
What the fuck you doing? Where am I going?
- Fuck you!

09:02.835 --> 09:05.462
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

09:05.629 --> 09:07.756
Yo, Chevy...
- Where's Verona?

09:07.923 --> 09:09.466
Talk!
- What about?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.469
Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

09:12.636 --> 09:14.263
Don't tell me to calm down!

09:14.471 --> 09:16.640
Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

09:16.807 --> 09:21.937
Hey, there's a white nigger with a gun
up in here! Just be still' motherfuckers!

09:22.104 --> 09:26.275
You see that?
I'm trying to help you here' man.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.985
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.154
Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.866
You don't know, but you're gonna tell me.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.536
Or I'm gonna
blow your brains into the fuckin' toilet!

09:38.871 --> 09:40.539
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

09:41.498 --> 09:44.835
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

09:45.002 --> 09:48.630
The white man is...
The white man is cool!

09:51.133 --> 09:53.051
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.014
Now look, Chevy
came here to discuss something.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.559
We gonna discuss
this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?

10:01.018 --> 10:04.897
You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

10:05.022 --> 10:08.734
Okay' I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

10:08.901 --> 10:12.738
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me!

10:12.905 --> 10:15.490
Easy! Easy! Easy!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.869
All right?
Things are beginning to clarify.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.206
See how that works' D?
Discussion leads to clarity.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.666
That's what I was telling you before.

10:24.833 --> 10:29.338
Look' you're operating under a false
pretence. Ricky and I did not pull...

10:29.505 --> 10:33.217
the Anselmo job together.
Ricky fucked me on the Anselmo job.

10:33.509 --> 10:37.262
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.432
Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.061
So, you see' I don't know where Verona is.
If I did,

10:44.228 --> 10:47.940
I'd probably be there right now'
beating the Gucci off his ass.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.026
All right.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.947
All right.

10:55.197 --> 10:59.409
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.920
Shit' dude.
What's wrong with you?

11:11.922 --> 11:14.091
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

11:14.925 --> 11:19.763
Well' obviously. You've made that point
abundantly clear to all of us here' today.

11:20.389 --> 11:24.434
How can I help you?
- Just give me some coke. You got any coke?

11:25.310 --> 11:28.146
Now you're just going to
come in here and insult me?

11:28.313 --> 11:31.066
I know you got coke.
- You think every brother's carrying?

11:31.233 --> 11:32.901
Come on, I don't have time!

11:33.944 --> 11:36.613
Just give me something.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.324
I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.160
No, I'm really fucking dying!

11:42.661 --> 11:44.955
Look, if I don't find Ricky Verona...

11:47.666 --> 11:49.585
May I please have some coke?

11:50.669 --> 11:55.299
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
- That's right.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.972
Well?

12:03.140 --> 12:07.644
What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.484
That's enough.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.953
What' you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

12:27.122 --> 12:29.208
Oh' God!

12:29.500 --> 12:31.502
Chevy...

12:31.668 --> 12:33.128
What the...

12:33.295 --> 12:37.716
Oh' that's good. That's good.
- That's good' right?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.139
Why you looking for Verona' anyway?

12:53.524 --> 12:56.527
Some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.738
This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

13:00.239 --> 13:04.076
I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course' I pulled the trigger.

13:04.243 --> 13:07.162
Why wouldn't I pull the fuckin' trigger?

13:08.914 --> 13:13.335
Whoa... Yo, Chelios, you good?

13:13.710 --> 13:16.088
This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.382
I know what I have to do.

13:20.342 --> 13:24.596
Well, shit.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

13:25.097 --> 13:28.517
What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.269
What?

13:32.229 --> 13:35.065
Shit!
- There he goes again.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.944
Who wants white meat?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.413
You ain't got shit, motherfucker!

13:49.580 --> 13:52.749
Put that fuckin' twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

13:56.295 --> 13:58.797
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

14:05.220 --> 14:07.556
<i>Doc?
- What's up, Doc?</i>

14:07.764 --> 14:10.726
You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

14:10.893 --> 14:13.312
<i>What the fuck you doing?
- Coming for you.</i>

14:13.478 --> 14:15.564
Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.150
I'll be waiting,
but you won't make it.

14:18.567 --> 14:24.156
You should know that I'm all about hooking up
with that mystery girl, you've been banging.

14:24.323 --> 14:30.454
<i>Soon as you're underground. I forgot
to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left.</i>

14:30.621 --> 14:35.334
What' and then you're gonna rape my
grandmother? Bla' bla' fuckin' bla.

14:35.501 --> 14:40.422
You listen to me. What do you think Carlito
will do when he finds out what you did?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.508
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

14:42.758 --> 14:44.676
<i>Driver, pull over!
- Fuck!</i>

14:44.801 --> 14:47.012
Great.

14:47.179 --> 14:51.808
<i>You talking about Carlito?
Because me and Carlito, we're boys now.</i>

14:51.975 --> 14:53.101
We're tight.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.480
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

14:56.688 --> 15:01.527
That's snappy. But I did you pretty good,
didn't I Chelios?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.153
<i>Admit it.
- We'll see.</i>

15:03.320 --> 15:04.655
<i>Pull over!</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:12.329
Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.458
Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.127
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?
Jesus Christ.</i>

15:19.294 --> 15:23.674
Sorry' Chevy' I just got the message.
- Okay. Forget it. Listen, I'm dying!

15:23.841 --> 15:26.385
I've been poisoned
with some Chinese synthetic shit.

15:27.177 --> 15:30.138
<i>What?
- You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

15:30.305 --> 15:33.559
<i>What are your symptoms?
- It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

15:33.725 --> 15:35.686
<i>Stuck in tar.
- Blurred vision?</i>

15:36.019 --> 15:37.688
<i>Yeah.
- Dizzy?</i>

15:37.855 --> 15:40.065
<i>Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?</i>

15:40.232 --> 15:42.568
Not really.
I feel good' right now.

15:43.360 --> 15:48.073
What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall' cops chasing me.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.418
The adrenaline is what's keeping you alive.

16:00.544 --> 16:04.673
<i>Having a little trouble hearing you.
- You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

16:08.343 --> 16:09.386
Explain.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.015
If I'm right'
they gave you the Beijing cocktail.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.018
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

16:18.729 --> 16:22.024
<i>It works on the adrenal gland,
blocks it's receptors.</i>

16:24.902 --> 16:29.781
<i>The only thing you can do to slow it down,
is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.</i>

16:32.034 --> 16:34.119
Meaning' if you stop' you die.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.370
Hang on.

16:38.624 --> 16:39.958
<i>Jesus! What...</i>

16:40.125 --> 16:42.127
<i>Are you there?
Are you okay?</i>

16:44.379 --> 16:48.258
<i>What'd you say' Doc?
- If you stop, you die!</i>

16:52.095 --> 16:56.141
That's what I'm trying to do.
Keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.895
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

17:01.396 --> 17:05.651
Every time I slow down'
it's like my veins start to rust.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.445
<i>Did you take anything?
- Couple grams of coke.</i>

17:09.613 --> 17:12.616
<i>That's a start.
I'll be in L.A. In an hour.</i>

17:12.782 --> 17:16.912
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Do not stop moving!</i>

17:22.459 --> 17:25.253
Taxi! Yo' yo' yo!

17:28.924 --> 17:30.634
Go!
- Where we go?

17:30.801 --> 17:33.470
Just drive!

17:36.348 --> 17:39.017
Would you mind...
- Where you want to go' man?

17:39.184 --> 17:41.186
Right.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.152
Oh' shit!
- Go right!

17:49.319 --> 17:51.989
Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

18:04.042 --> 18:05.544
Crank the music.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.176
Crank it!

18:14.511 --> 18:17.848
<i>But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart</i>

18:18.015 --> 18:21.810
<i>I just don't think he'd understand</i>

18:21.977 --> 18:25.856
<i>And if you tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

18:26.064 --> 18:30.319
<i>It might blow up and kill this man</i>

18:37.534 --> 18:39.077
Pull over' pull over.

18:40.829 --> 18:45.709
Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.341
Hey' buddy!

18:55.552 --> 18:58.013
You move' you die.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.475
<i>Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called...
- Fuck!</i>

19:56.238 --> 19:57.447
Where to' man?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.784
Beverly Hills.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.898
Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.734
What a surprise.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.905
Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.908
Word travels fast.

21:23.867 --> 21:28.038
Well' then you know what happened.
- You amaze me, my friend.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.582
Well, what can I say?

21:30.749 --> 21:33.919
Carlito' I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

21:34.086 --> 21:39.091
No' not much.
- Yeah, we...

21:40.092 --> 21:42.594
We've gotta find an antidote, or something.

21:44.346 --> 21:48.183
What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you...

21:48.350 --> 21:50.435
It's that Chinese shit.

21:50.602 --> 21:54.940
There is no antidote.
I wish there was something I could do.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.568
What, that's it?
- Honestly,

21:58.443 --> 22:01.071
you should be dead already.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.240
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

22:03.407 --> 22:05.117
We give that shit to horses.

22:05.534 --> 22:09.121
I don't fucking believe this.
- I'm sorry.

22:09.288 --> 22:12.374
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

22:15.043 --> 22:19.047
What do you expect me to do?
- Find that punk Verona,

22:19.214 --> 22:23.802
and his whole fucking crew'
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

22:25.596 --> 22:29.975
What is this?
What' are you boys now or something?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.977
Verona?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.771
That's a small time punk.

22:36.064 --> 22:39.610
Not to say that this isn't an opportunity.
- Opportunity?

22:40.152 --> 22:42.988
Everyone knows
the love I have for you' Chev.

22:43.155 --> 22:47.075
But maybe this
makes up for the Don Kim hit which was...

22:47.242 --> 22:50.162
perhaps ill-advised.
- Fuckin' Ill-advised?

22:52.623 --> 22:56.168
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.670
Well' that's outstanding' Carlito.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.758
Glad to know my death
can be of some use to you.

23:03.467 --> 23:06.929
Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

23:07.095 --> 23:11.600
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day' brother!

23:13.644 --> 23:15.812
Are you disrespecting me?

23:17.981 --> 23:20.150
Is that what you're doing?

23:27.533 --> 23:30.452
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.234
You're not getting in my cab' wet!

24:02.401 --> 24:07.823
I just gave you $200 to wait for 3 minutes.
- You're not getting in my car' no way!

24:09.074 --> 24:10.909
Yeah' you're right.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.539
Al-Qaeda!
Al-Qaeda!

24:17.875 --> 24:20.252
I love America!
I love Bush!

24:21.211 --> 24:22.588
I Voted Bush!

24:39.521 --> 24:41.899
Yeah.
- Hey' Chev. My flight's delayed.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.443
<i>Shit!
- It's all right. Relax.</i>

24:44.776 --> 24:49.740
I mean' don't relax. That shit they
gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.

24:50.073 --> 24:55.746
<i>Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your
body to make a chemical called ephedrine.</i>

24:56.580 --> 24:59.583
<i>They introduced an inhibitor to your system.
- Fuck!</i>

24:59.750 --> 25:03.795
<i>You've got to massively
increase the ephedrine level in your body,</i>

25:03.962 --> 25:06.632
<i>to force out the inhibitors.
Go to a hospital.</i>

25:06.798 --> 25:09.301
Get epinephrine' an artificial adrenaline.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.638
<i>It comes in 10-milligram syringes.</i>

25:12.888 --> 25:16.600
A 5th of an injection will do.
It's potent, so don't overdo it.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.770
Chevy? Did you get that?

25:21.271 --> 25:24.566
<i>Did you get that?
- Yeah, epi-something.</i>

25:25.817 --> 25:27.569
Okay' okay. I've gotta go.

25:27.945 --> 25:31.740
<i>Now, I'll call you when I get there.</i>

25:31.907 --> 25:34.827
<i>Yeah?
- Chev.</i>

25:34.952 --> 25:35.994
Yeah?

25:36.286 --> 25:37.788
Chev?
- What?

25:38.664 --> 25:40.666
<i>Hello?</i>

25:42.751 --> 25:43.961
Come on!

25:44.127 --> 25:45.504
Mother!

25:47.798 --> 25:49.675
<i>Chev?
- Yes' fuck?</i>

25:50.300 --> 25:54.096
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

25:54.263 --> 25:55.973
The Prince.
- Yeah.

25:56.139 --> 26:00.352
I was just down here getting a taco'
and he walked in' 2 minutes ago.

26:04.815 --> 26:08.193
Where are you' now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

26:08.360 --> 26:12.447
Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.723
Is he in there, now?

26:37.890 --> 26:40.225
Did anyone go in with him?

26:44.188 --> 26:45.981
Right' wait here.

27:59.221 --> 28:05.102
How'd you like that one' tough guy?
How frickin' awesome was that' huh?

28:08.772 --> 28:09.773
Well, well.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.944
You feel like talking?
Where's your fuckin' brother?

28:14.736 --> 28:17.614
Doing your mother like a whore, you bitch!

28:18.490 --> 28:23.245
Nice. I wonder
how many steaks I could carve out of you.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.289
You died' motherfucker!

28:40.637 --> 28:42.806
Yeah' wanna fuck with me' ese?

28:43.015 --> 28:46.018
What, you rolling pin mighty good?

28:46.351 --> 28:49.688
What the hell you think you doing, huh?

28:52.149 --> 28:55.027
What,
you want to dance with me' motherfucker?

28:56.320 --> 28:59.823
I'll fuck you up!
Come on!

29:13.670 --> 29:16.965
Jesus!
Nothing's easy.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.553
Wanna hold hands?

29:41.365 --> 29:43.826
<i>Hey, talk to me' bro.
- Hey, Ricky.</i>

29:44.159 --> 29:46.578
<i>You in the mood for sucking me off?</i>

29:46.745 --> 29:50.040
<i>Maybe let me lick your ass or something?</i>

29:50.207 --> 29:52.918
<i>Who is this?
Shit! Chelios?</i>

29:53.085 --> 29:56.088
<i>Is this fucking Chelios?
- That's right, bro.</i>

29:56.213 --> 30:00.717
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone.
I'm sure you have it all figured out.</i>

30:00.884 --> 30:05.889
Looks like you should've
cut me up when you had the chance.

30:07.015 --> 30:13.188
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.
You experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

30:13.522 --> 30:15.691
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

30:15.858 --> 30:20.237
<i>You know, I kind of like that shit you put in
me. Gonna give me some more?</i>

30:20.696 --> 30:24.616
Well' I'm... I'm...
- I know, I know. Hey...

30:25.200 --> 30:26.535
What's this?

30:30.706 --> 30:34.960
A necklace! You guys
really are faggots, aren't you?

30:35.127 --> 30:40.757
You motherfucker! My grandfather gave
that medallion to my father and then he...

30:40.924 --> 30:42.301
Fuck!

30:43.468 --> 30:48.473
Fuck you, man! Shove that thing up your ass!
- No thanks.

30:48.932 --> 30:54.438
You know' I believe I'll hang on to it.
You'll have to come find me' after all.

30:55.314 --> 30:59.276
Fucked up that you killed your own brother.
- You...

31:04.114 --> 31:08.785
What's that shit?
Epi... 10 milligrams?

31:09.286 --> 31:10.746
Good work, Kaylo.

31:32.142 --> 31:35.145
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

31:35.312 --> 31:38.357
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

31:42.444 --> 31:45.697
Asshole!
- No need to push.

31:45.989 --> 31:50.160
I'm looking for
something that starts with "E".

31:50.327 --> 31:51.453
England?

31:52.329 --> 31:55.666
Very funny. No.
Some kind of artificial adrenaline.

31:58.001 --> 32:02.172
Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

32:03.048 --> 32:06.218
Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.720
I love you. Epinephrine.

32:09.346 --> 32:12.516
I can't give you epinephrine.
- Why?

32:13.308 --> 32:15.018
Just a minute.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.896
Oi! What do you mean...

32:18.021 --> 32:20.065
What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.150
Miserable bitch!
What?

32:22.359 --> 32:27.739
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.087
Hey!

32:48.760 --> 32:51.763
Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

33:56.078 --> 33:58.997
This room's clear.

34:23.480 --> 34:27.442
<i>Could anyone
speaking Korean please come to ER?</i>

34:27.609 --> 34:29.527
<i>Anyone speaking Korean...</i>

34:35.617 --> 34:37.828
Yo, yo, yo!

34:37.995 --> 34:39.705
Yo!

34:39.871 --> 34:41.165
Stop!

34:43.167 --> 34:45.335
Stop!

34:46.210 --> 34:47.337
Jerk-off!

34:56.221 --> 34:58.307
Coming through!

35:00.684 --> 35:04.354
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine.

35:07.024 --> 35:10.194
Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

35:12.154 --> 35:16.241
I'm having a bad day.
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this cart!

35:16.825 --> 35:18.243
You all right?

35:18.494 --> 35:20.329
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

35:20.496 --> 35:22.998
Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.417
Get back!
- Take it easy!

35:25.584 --> 35:30.589
Do you understand fucking English?
- Yes' I just don't know which draw it's in.

35:30.756 --> 35:31.840
Look!

35:32.049 --> 35:36.345
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is' man!

35:36.512 --> 35:39.723
What is this, a rest home?
- What are you doing back there?

35:39.890 --> 35:41.266
Hurry up!

35:41.433 --> 35:44.186
Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

35:44.394 --> 35:48.941
I don't know if I have it. Give me a second!
- Put the weapon down!

35:49.107 --> 35:51.610
What the fuck!
Where the fuck is it?

35:52.736 --> 35:55.280
My heart!
- What?

35:55.447 --> 35:57.616
My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

35:57.783 --> 36:00.536
Drop your weapon' now!

36:02.955 --> 36:06.375
What do you think you're doing? This is...
- Shut up! You!

36:06.542 --> 36:09.628
Gimme the epinephrine?

36:11.755 --> 36:14.424
Don't even think about it!

36:14.633 --> 36:19.596
Albuterol... Flortab... Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

36:21.431 --> 36:23.100
Here you go.
- Gimme that.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.103
Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

36:26.270 --> 36:28.772
...all right? Just be quiet.

36:29.064 --> 36:31.984
Juice me.

36:32.109 --> 36:34.945
Juice?

36:35.112 --> 36:36.780
Do it.

36:36.947 --> 36:38.157
All right.
- Come on!

36:39.449 --> 36:41.493
I haven't got all day.

36:42.119 --> 36:46.248
Okay, I need both of them to...
Give them to me.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.669
One.

36:51.295 --> 36:53.505
Two. Clear!

36:57.009 --> 36:58.427
Get the fuck back!

37:00.679 --> 37:02.181
Get out!

37:51.730 --> 37:55.359
How much of this stuff did he say to take?

38:48.537 --> 38:50.622
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

38:51.039 --> 38:52.791
<i>Did you get the stuff?
- Got it.</i>

38:52.958 --> 38:54.418
Did you take it?
- Yup.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.545
<i>You took the whole thing.
- Yup.</i>

38:56.712 --> 38:59.923
I said one 5th. The shit's gonna kill you.
- Right.

39:00.090 --> 39:01.550
<i>Chest on fire?
- Check.</i>

39:01.717 --> 39:03.093
<i>But you're cold.
- Check.</i>

39:03.260 --> 39:07.431
And you've got a steel hard on, don't you?
- Let me check.

39:08.056 --> 39:10.601
Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

39:10.767 --> 39:14.730
Urinary sphincter's so tight'
you couldn't piss to save your life.

39:14.897 --> 39:16.398
Urinary sphincter' check!

39:17.608 --> 39:20.611
<i>Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.</i>

39:20.777 --> 39:25.782
<i>Get some grass. That shit'll be out of
your system in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

39:26.116 --> 39:30.329
This is costing me a fortune.
I'll call you in 20 minutes when we land.

39:30.496 --> 39:31.955
<i>Copy.
- Hey, Chevy?</i>

39:32.289 --> 39:36.126
You're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.

39:36.418 --> 39:37.586
Copy, out.

39:39.004 --> 39:40.839
Some medical emergency.

39:42.299 --> 39:46.428
<i>Police have declined to name
the man they say is still at large,</i>

39:46.595 --> 39:49.264
<i>on a citywide rampage
that has left one man dead,</i>

39:49.473 --> 39:53.769
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds
of thousands of dollars of damage...</i>

39:53.936 --> 39:58.482
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.
The suspect is a professional killer...</i>

39:58.649 --> 40:01.652
<i>with ties to organized crime
and a long police record.</i>

40:02.027 --> 40:04.947
<i>He is considered armed and highly dangerous.</i>

40:05.113 --> 40:08.826
<i>We now continue with regularly
scheduled programming,</i>

40:08.992 --> 40:13.997
<i>but stay tuned for continuing coverage
of this bizarre story, as it unfolds.</i>

40:14.456 --> 40:19.044
<i>What your saying is that next to olives,
onions, lemons and limes...</i>

40:34.309 --> 40:37.229
Oh' shit!
Take it easy.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.856
Get back, pig!

40:39.189 --> 40:41.483
I... just give me the...

40:41.650 --> 40:44.069
Come on, then.
Let's see you run, piggy.

40:44.236 --> 40:45.529
Come on' piggy.

40:46.155 --> 40:48.699
Give me the gun.
Let's talk this over.

40:48.866 --> 40:53.078
Yeah' you want it?
There.

42:24.962 --> 42:28.340
Honey, let's go. Come on.
- Be careful.

42:30.634 --> 42:34.304
All right.
I'm gonna get some help' all right?

42:35.514 --> 42:36.807
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:36.974 --> 42:40.811
<i>Hey, did you try to call?
- You've been home all day?</i>

42:42.521 --> 42:47.151
I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great' Eve.

42:47.317 --> 42:48.986
Super great.

42:49.153 --> 42:52.156
<i>You all rested, now?
Glad to hear it.</i>

42:53.115 --> 42:56.285
Listen' I've been fatally poisoned.

42:56.451 --> 42:59.621
A psychopath's on his way over
to torture and kill you,

42:59.788 --> 43:04.668
but don't get out of bed' I'll be
over in a flash. Could you fry up a waffle?

43:04.835 --> 43:10.340
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
- Right, you'll be there. Okay.

43:10.966 --> 43:12.009
Bye.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.775
So, let's go get the bitch!

44:24.081 --> 44:26.124
I hate you.

44:31.755 --> 44:33.799
Second.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.927
Come on!

44:37.094 --> 44:40.889
Come on, please!

44:42.266 --> 44:46.144
All right' all right. Jesus!

44:47.604 --> 44:49.565
Oh my God!

44:53.110 --> 44:56.488
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

44:56.905 --> 44:58.157
It's gross.

45:01.577 --> 45:04.830
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

45:05.497 --> 45:06.748
Yes!

45:08.333 --> 45:12.296
You haven't watched TV today' right?
- No' why?

45:12.462 --> 45:16.008
Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be a freak.

45:16.175 --> 45:17.676
Get dressed.

45:17.843 --> 45:22.306
Actually, can you change the clock on the
microwave? I never changed it back.

45:22.472 --> 45:24.766
What?
- The microwave.

45:24.975 --> 45:29.479
Change the clock. The daylight
savings time, I never changed it back.

45:29.646 --> 45:32.483
The microwave?
- Yes.

45:32.649 --> 45:36.820
Listen' I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

45:36.987 --> 45:41.700
That's sweet! You okay?
You look like you're on drugs or something.

45:42.826 --> 45:44.828
You love me' yeah?

45:46.163 --> 45:48.457
Yes.

45:48.624 --> 45:52.503
Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

45:52.669 --> 45:58.008
I need you to put some clothes on
and come with me, right now.

45:58.175 --> 46:01.178
No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

46:01.345 --> 46:03.514
Okay. All right.

46:22.324 --> 46:24.201
Shit's wearing off.

46:25.035 --> 46:29.832
The waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
- Great.

46:31.375 --> 46:33.210
Great.

46:55.607 --> 46:58.277
You're so stressed out.
Want some pot?

46:59.236 --> 47:01.071
Yeah! No!

47:03.574 --> 47:06.076
Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

47:06.243 --> 47:10.873
Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

47:11.456 --> 47:13.458
What the...

47:13.917 --> 47:17.546
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

47:19.798 --> 47:20.799
Can we just...

47:20.841 --> 47:21.842
Fine.

47:33.687 --> 47:36.482
Parked out the back.
- Oh.

47:37.316 --> 47:40.360
Darn! That... thing.
- What thing?

47:40.527 --> 47:43.363
The waffle thing.
I gotta turn it off.

47:58.504 --> 47:59.713
Hello?

48:00.714 --> 48:02.341
Hello?

48:08.222 --> 48:10.182
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

48:13.018 --> 48:14.520
God' I hate that.

48:17.523 --> 48:20.400
Do you want to burn the building down?

48:29.201 --> 48:31.328
Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

48:31.745 --> 48:34.164
Nice one. Chev?

48:34.331 --> 48:36.917
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.545
I swear to God' Chev.

48:40.671 --> 48:44.007
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

48:48.178 --> 48:51.014
My hand cream!
That's where you went.

49:00.023 --> 49:02.901
Chev? Can I have some help, here?

49:07.614 --> 49:11.785
Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

49:41.607 --> 49:43.567
You're embarrassing me.

49:43.984 --> 49:47.070
I didn't have
a lot of time to pick this out.

49:51.283 --> 49:53.785
So' why are we here?

50:11.303 --> 50:15.599
This isn't gonna be...
This isn't gonna be easy' as they say.

50:18.685 --> 50:19.978
Oh, fucker.

50:20.145 --> 50:23.649
All right' here it is.
- Sorry.

50:28.445 --> 50:31.782
I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

50:31.949 --> 50:34.201
That was a lie.

50:34.326 --> 50:36.203
Actually...

50:38.997 --> 50:40.874
I kill people.

50:41.542 --> 50:46.171
Professional hitman. I freelance
for a major West Coast crime syndicate.

50:46.672 --> 50:50.551
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit' nothing special.

50:51.885 --> 50:56.056
<i>The Triads, from Hong Kong,
had been moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

50:56.807 --> 51:01.061
<i>My target was
the number 1 man in Los Angeles, Don Kim.</i>

51:09.903 --> 51:11.738
Well?

51:12.364 --> 51:14.575
What are you waiting for?

51:15.159 --> 51:22.332
<i>Then, this insane idea comes through the back
of my head, like a.45 slug at close range.</i>

51:24.251 --> 51:26.753
Congratulations.

51:27.421 --> 51:31.383
Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

51:33.010 --> 51:37.097
100 grand wants you dead.
So' sooner or later it's gonna happen'

51:37.264 --> 51:39.766
but I'm not doing it.

51:40.392 --> 51:42.269
I see.

51:42.895 --> 51:47.900
Instead you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town. Disappear.

51:48.066 --> 51:51.361
I don't care where you go or what you do'

51:51.528 --> 51:56.450
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

51:56.909 --> 51:59.119
48 hours?

52:00.537 --> 52:03.081
Or, if you prefer,
we can do it the other way.

52:04.750 --> 52:08.587
The way where I go to work'
and you meet Buddha.

52:23.393 --> 52:26.313
You see?
I quit.

52:26.438 --> 52:29.650
I quit the business' for you.

52:31.568 --> 52:34.112
For me?
- Yeah.

52:34.279 --> 52:37.658
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

52:37.825 --> 52:40.994
We get on a plane'
leave this shit' never come back.

52:41.912 --> 52:45.582
Pretty crazy, huh?
- You are so weird.

52:47.668 --> 52:51.004
Are we going on a trip?
- Well...

52:52.464 --> 52:56.927
I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me...

52:57.344 --> 53:00.681
Please! Wait' please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

53:00.806 --> 53:04.685
Chinese poison?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

53:04.810 --> 53:07.437
If you're leaving me'
then tell me the truth!

53:07.771 --> 53:10.023
Oh' right.
You think it sounds crazy.

53:10.190 --> 53:13.819
How do you think I feel?
I have to live this shit!

53:15.320 --> 53:17.823
Chev? Chev?

53:20.159 --> 53:21.660
What's wrong?

53:24.329 --> 53:26.999
Wait a minute' you trust me?
- No.

53:27.666 --> 53:30.169
Make love to me.
- What?

53:30.669 --> 53:34.673
I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

53:34.840 --> 53:38.969
Take your clothes off.
- No!

53:39.344 --> 53:40.345
No!

53:40.846 --> 53:44.308
You said you wanted to be more spontaneous.
- You're crazy!

53:44.474 --> 53:47.311
You're an adrenaline junkie with no soul!

53:47.811 --> 53:50.898
Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

53:54.568 --> 53:58.822
I'm sorry.
Oh my God' are you okay?

53:58.989 --> 54:00.699
Are you okay?

54:05.370 --> 54:07.831
No! No!

54:09.208 --> 54:10.250
Shit!

54:13.003 --> 54:15.506
Get off!

54:25.599 --> 54:27.684
You filthy animal!

54:28.393 --> 54:32.064
Take me right here' in front of everyone!

54:32.272 --> 54:35.400
That's it!

54:35.567 --> 54:37.569
Come on! Do it!

54:37.736 --> 54:39.696
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

54:39.863 --> 54:41.615
Come on!
- I'm trying!

54:43.534 --> 54:47.037
Oh' God!
Now you can't get it up?

54:47.746 --> 54:50.958
Come on' get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

54:59.424 --> 55:01.552
Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

55:15.232 --> 55:17.234
I'm alive! I'm alive!

55:17.442 --> 55:19.945
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

55:21.113 --> 55:24.116
Oh' my God! Wow!

55:27.828 --> 55:31.832
Oh, my God! Yes!

55:34.126 --> 55:36.962
Yeah?
- What are you doing?

55:37.462 --> 55:39.923
<i>I've got Verona.
- Kaylo?</i>

55:40.465 --> 55:42.843
<i>I've got Verona, man.</i>

55:44.761 --> 55:47.181
What?
- No shit?

55:47.514 --> 55:51.018
<i>Where are you?
- Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

55:51.185 --> 55:55.105
What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

55:55.856 --> 56:00.819
Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

56:00.986 --> 56:05.449
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it?
- Yeah' Chev.

56:06.492 --> 56:09.495
Honey, I gotta go.
Please understand.

56:09.828 --> 56:12.831
No, Chev, I do not understand!

56:13.207 --> 56:15.334
Oh, baby!

56:16.335 --> 56:17.794
I'll call you!

56:20.964 --> 56:22.549
What are you looking at?

56:35.145 --> 56:38.524
Hey man' what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

56:39.024 --> 56:44.738
Right' just step on it' all right?
- You're won't die in my cab, crackhead.

56:45.030 --> 56:46.740
I got something for you.

56:51.662 --> 56:53.247
Take this Haitian shit.

56:53.539 --> 56:58.168
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

57:01.588 --> 57:06.009
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

57:06.260 --> 57:09.555
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

57:10.889 --> 57:13.433
Now look at you.

57:16.562 --> 57:19.565
What the hell.

57:28.866 --> 57:30.909
Yeah.

57:31.743 --> 57:35.956
It tastes like ass.

57:37.040 --> 57:40.043
That's right' devil. You wait.

58:14.745 --> 58:16.747
Shut the fuck up!
- No!

58:16.955 --> 58:19.249
No!
- Shut the fuck up!

58:27.674 --> 58:30.928
Whoop, there it is!
Fuck him!

58:37.643 --> 58:38.852
We're here.

58:45.150 --> 58:49.822
What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you' it's hardcore.

58:55.869 --> 58:59.206
It'll be $5.55.

59:01.375 --> 59:06.213
It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

59:12.052 --> 59:13.554
This is fucked.

59:16.014 --> 59:17.224
Where's he going?

59:22.479 --> 59:27.234
Yeah' okay. How the fuck you
going to call me' talking shit?

59:27.359 --> 59:31.363
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at...

59:31.530 --> 59:34.074
Fucking call me talking shit!

59:36.994 --> 59:39.746
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

59:41.874 --> 59:44.918
I'm out here,
doing what I do. I'm a rooftop mother...

59:45.711 --> 59:47.713
Hey, Chevy!
What's up' dog?

59:47.880 --> 59:50.215
Everything okay?
You chillin'? You good?

59:50.382 --> 59:53.051
What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

59:53.218 --> 59:57.222
What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually' I thought a helicopter...

59:57.389 --> 59:58.891
What is this?
- What?

59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.435
You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:05.731
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:10.277
Okay' ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean' "ding"?

01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:12.946
What do you mean, "ding"?

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:20.746
Where is that motherfucker?

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:22.581
Chev.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:28.462
What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.590
Oh' you mean like this?

01:00:33.759 --> 01:00:38.472
Now you tell me where that
little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:41.308
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:43.977
What?

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:48.816
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:52.110
You've totally lost your shit, dog.

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:56.406
You're all over TV. Destroying property,
making unauthorized hits...

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:01.745
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

01:01:01.912 --> 01:01:04.748
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look'

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:07.668
don't worry'
we'll take care of Verona.

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:13.006
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice' dark' quiet place and...

01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:14.842
just die.

01:01:21.974 --> 01:01:26.353
Just die. You think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.613
Maybe you're right.

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:41.618
We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:45.038
We all got to die sometime.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:48.125
So' I'll just die.

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:54.214
What the...

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.744
Of all the fuckin'...
- You got shot!

01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:25.245
Mother...

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:28.749
Jesus!
Eve, move!

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.601
You' asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

01:02:47.726 --> 01:02:50.854
My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

01:04:19.485 --> 01:04:21.528
Oh' God!

01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:26.533
I had to see if you were telling the truth.

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:31.038
Come on.

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.540
No, wait!

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:40.714
Now, come on.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.469
Oh' God!

01:04:48.055 --> 01:04:49.306
Oh, dammit!

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.976
I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:57.147
Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.654
Come! Come!
- My stuff!

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:07.324
All my stuff!

01:05:36.854 --> 01:05:39.273
You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:45.028
No, I mean...
that you would give it all up for me.

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:47.197
Yeah.

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:51.869
And the other part?
- The poison's true' too.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.081
Then... that means...

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:58.041
Pretty much, Eve.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.591
How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:12.556
So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

01:06:16.935 --> 01:06:18.270
What are you doing?

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:20.814
This'll get you going.
- What?

01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:24.943
Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:30.115
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:36.121
You like that?
- Stay down!

01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:41.960
Motherfuck!

01:06:45.464 --> 01:06:48.967
Jesus! Yeah, that's it' baby.
Just a little more.

01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:56.016
Stay down, Eve.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:07.361
Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

01:07:08.445 --> 01:07:10.197
Oh my God!

01:07:14.535 --> 01:07:16.453
Just a touch...

01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:21.792
What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.128
I don't think so.

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:26.880
Jesus! Fuck!

01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:11.341
Are they really...

01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:14.052
They're dead.

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:17.555
How do you...
How can you do that?

01:08:19.558 --> 01:08:22.560
I told you, baby. I quit.

01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:31.361
Where are you going?
- Stay there, honey.

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:36.241
Jesus! Fuck!
- Chev!

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:40.037
Asshole!

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:13.111
I can't feel my leg.

01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:26.124
Shit!
I've been trying to call you for a half hour.

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:28.794
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office.</i>

01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:31.921
<i>Can you make it over here?
- Sure' why not?</i>

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:41.473
Chocolate' what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?

01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:44.600
Snacks.

01:09:58.991 --> 01:10:00.993
I hate television.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.995
I owe you again, Doc.

01:10:03.162 --> 01:10:07.040
Chevy' you're my best customer.

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:11.545
What is this stuff?
- Synthetic epinephrine...

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:15.883
diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

01:10:16.967 --> 01:10:21.388
Well, I got a little meth in there' too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

01:10:25.309 --> 01:10:27.227
Wait a minute.
I'm not better?

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.063
No' you're not better.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:35.861
You're in such shit shape' it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.

01:10:36.028 --> 01:10:39.239
You should be in a fucking medical journal.

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:50.083
So, what are you going to do?
- The solution acts as a competing inhibitor.

01:10:50.334 --> 01:10:53.086
It's pushing
the poison out of your receptors'

01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:56.715
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:58.050
Then what?

01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:01.053
Then you're fucked.

01:11:03.055 --> 01:11:07.559
I can put you on life support
and string this out for a few days.

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:11.396
But you're going to
go into a comma at some point.

01:11:11.563 --> 01:11:13.440
Does she know?

01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:22.407
Why don't I load you up with something,
and you can go out in a beautiful dream.

01:11:24.535 --> 01:11:26.411
A dream.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.458
Can I do that for you?

01:11:33.043 --> 01:11:37.422
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:39.800
What do you want?

01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:42.761
One hour.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:48.142
I want one hour.

01:11:57.151 --> 01:11:58.819
Give me a fuckin' break.

01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:09.329
<i>So, the wild rampage that began 9am in
L.A. Continues. The suspect, still at large.</i>

01:12:10.956 --> 01:12:13.667
We didn't give him
enough of the Chinese shit.

01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:17.004
You think?

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:23.510
Dude, it's him!

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:29.433
<i>What's up' corpse?
- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.438
<i>Thought you might be interested in a deal.
- Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

01:12:34.605 --> 01:12:36.690
Don't you worry about what I am.

01:12:37.024 --> 01:12:42.112
<i>Listen, I want the antidote.
- Oh, the antidote?</i>

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:46.116
<i>That's right, the antidote.
- What you prepared to give me?</i>

01:12:46.283 --> 01:12:51.622
How about the jewelry I got off that
faggot brother of yours' you cocksucker?

01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:55.792
<i>Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis.
- Okay.</i>

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.878
<i>You like the deal?
- Whatever!</i>

01:12:58.003 --> 01:13:00.631
Be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes.

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:02.549
<i>You know the spot?
- Yeah.</i>

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:06.553
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the
thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.140
Look' I said I said I'd fuckin' be...
Fuck!

01:13:10.849 --> 01:13:13.352
See you later, sunshine.
...turn that shit off.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.521
Dammit! Fuck!

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.489
Yo' it's Verona.
You won't believe this call I just got.

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:42.881
<i>It's gonna be all right, baby.</i>

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:46.093
<i>But you said...
- No, no.</i>

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.928
<i>Things have changed.</i>

01:13:48.095 --> 01:13:52.724
<i>There's an antidote. I can
make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.</i>

01:13:53.684 --> 01:13:56.728
<i>I'm scared.
- Of course.</i>

01:13:57.396 --> 01:14:00.107
<i>You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.</i>

01:14:01.233 --> 01:14:03.235
Promise?

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:05.571
I promise.

01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:17.935
What's happening' bro?

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:42.376
<i>Where did I go wrong?
- You fuckin' just say something?</i>

01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:44.795
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

01:15:47.339 --> 01:15:51.134
<i>Mom?
- I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.</i>

01:15:51.301 --> 01:15:53.303
<i>You never call, you never write.</i>

01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:56.807
<i>I haven't seen you
since you ran out at 16.</i>

01:15:56.974 --> 01:16:01.061
Yeah, yeah. Right' Mom.
With you popping Valium like tic tacs'

01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:06.567
boning a new asshole every 2 weeks, why
wouldn't I stick around with fun like that?

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:13.407
<i>Please' I haven't got time for this.
- You got no time, period.</i>

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:17.202
<i>Orlando?
- You're a persistent motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

01:16:17.369 --> 01:16:19.997
<i>I give you that.
- This is weird.</i>

01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:24.209
<i>I know this is weird,
but this has got to stop sometimes...</i>

01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:29.339
<i>They pop you and you keep getting up?</i>

01:16:30.007 --> 01:16:34.553
<i>I'm the terminator.
- You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.556
You know, I just don't get it.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:40.726
Why didn't you just cut me up
when you had the chance?

01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:43.228
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.
Look at you.</i>

01:16:43.437 --> 01:16:49.776
<i>Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies...
- Adrenaline junkie, addicted to violence...</i>

01:16:50.569 --> 01:16:54.072
<i>Probably spends every day
of his life looking for the big rush.</i>

01:16:54.239 --> 01:17:00.120
<i>Carving up a guy, while he screams in
his own blood and excrement, would be like...</i>

01:17:00.245 --> 01:17:03.373
<i>like a gift.
A warriors death.</i>

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:07.211
<i>Hell, you'd probably get off on it.</i>

01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:10.923
What' did you rehearse this?
- No' no.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:16.929
<i>This was the best way for a guy like you.
Slow ticking clock, winding down.</i>

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:20.974
<i>Inevitable, non-negotiable, until...
- Who the hell are you?</i>

01:17:25.062 --> 01:17:28.649
<i>I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Better late than never.</i>

01:17:29.316 --> 01:17:31.401
<i>You know you're gonna die up there.</i>

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:35.906
Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:50.462
Some pills' Doc.

01:18:06.645 --> 01:18:09.940
Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:18.782
Hold up.

01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:23.495
Give me the piece.

01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:46.059
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:49.146
What a fucking nightmare you are.

01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:50.814
No shit.

01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:52.524
Sit down.

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:56.653
Whoa! Wait a minute.
You pat him down, again.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:59.239
I know he's carrying something.

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:04.495
Let me see it.

01:19:07.998 --> 01:19:09.583
Motherfucker.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:12.669
Clever.
What is this, an insulin pump?

01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:14.046
Basically.

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.089
What the fuck is insulin?

01:19:17.257 --> 01:19:18.425
Ephedrine' right?

01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:22.429
Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:28.852
Found a new master' little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:33.899
You'll be a bitch when Carlito
hires you for half what he paid me.

01:19:34.066 --> 01:19:35.442
That's enough.

01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:39.446
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

01:19:39.613 --> 01:19:42.032
I'm nobody's little bitch!

01:19:42.199 --> 01:19:44.034
You fuckin' hear me?

01:19:44.201 --> 01:19:46.912
He'll pay what I tell him to pay!
- Enough!

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:48.622
Sit down!

01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:56.296
It's been a long fucking day.

01:19:56.463 --> 01:20:00.300
In the end' you have to admit'
it all works out quite nicely.

01:20:00.425 --> 01:20:03.804
Don Kim gets his bullet,
thanks to you,

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:07.432
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.

01:20:08.559 --> 01:20:13.063
Please understand' it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:17.943
That what I think it is?

01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:22.573
It's the Chinese shit.

01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:25.617
Hold him down.

01:20:27.786 --> 01:20:30.289
Not so fast, motherfucker!

01:20:31.456 --> 01:20:33.792
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

01:20:36.295 --> 01:20:37.963
Whatever, psycho.

01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:44.428
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over'
my friend.

01:20:52.352 --> 01:20:54.480
Our Father' who art in...
- Shut up!

01:20:54.646 --> 01:20:57.691
So, this is how it is.

01:20:59.485 --> 01:21:03.530
It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:29.723
<i>Police have moved
to surround the Hotel Lint,</i>

01:21:29.848 --> 01:21:32.518
<i>where the madman
behind today's mayhem...</i>

01:21:32.684 --> 01:21:36.063
<i>is holed up
and making a desperate last stand.</i>

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:39.566
<i>Officials have confirmed
gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

01:21:39.733 --> 01:21:45.072
<i>Our news chopper will bring live,
uncensored coverage from above the hotel.</i>

01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:52.204
<i>Again, this coverage is uncensored, so any
small children present should leave the room.</i>

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.387
Get me out of here, now!

01:22:17.729 --> 01:22:19.565
I'll kill you' Chelios!

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.441
Too late!

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:29.741
Look out!

01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:32.202
Thanks' boss.

01:23:52.825 --> 01:23:56.036
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

01:24:02.334 --> 01:24:03.877
Present from Kaylo.

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:14.513
Now what?
Now you say shit!

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.181
Where the fuck were you?

01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:18.892
Who's the bitch' now?

01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:28.402
No, no! You fly' motherfucker!

01:24:30.028 --> 01:24:31.697
Motherfuckin' fly!

01:25:21.455 --> 01:25:22.539
You're dead!

01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.792
Oh my God!

01:25:39.389 --> 01:25:41.308
You're dead' motherfucker!

01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:14.341
I told you I'd kill you' you little bitch!

01:26:37.156 --> 01:26:40.325
<i>Hey, its Eve.
I'm glad you called but I'm not here.</i>

01:26:40.492 --> 01:26:45.122
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

01:26:45.289 --> 01:26:49.209
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

01:26:49.835 --> 01:26:51.837
Hey' doll...

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:56.800
Looks like I let you down' again.

01:26:57.468 --> 01:27:02.055
<i>Seems like all my life
I've just been going... going...</i>

01:27:02.848 --> 01:27:04.516
<i>going...</i>

01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:09.521
I wish I'd taken more time to
stop and smell the roses' so to speak.

01:27:11.648 --> 01:27:15.903
Well' I guess it's too late for that now.

01:27:19.531 --> 01:27:24.369
You're the greatest' baby.
