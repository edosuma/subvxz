00:02.212 --> 00:04.304
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

00:04.305 --> 00:09.898
...he has lost the race. President Conrad
Dalton will be a one term president.

00:09.899 --> 00:11.556
- Run as an independent.
- What?

00:11.625 --> 00:14.628
Okay, my computer is officially
possessed. It keeps crashing.

00:14.629 --> 00:17.109
I'll take it to the White House,
see if Oliver Shaw can fix it.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.832
Someone was hacked into the webcam.

00:18.833 --> 00:22.201
You should take this to the
FBI for further examination.

00:23.937 --> 00:25.497
I said we shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

00:25.521 --> 00:26.673
ELIZABETH: Like it was

00:26.674 --> 00:29.508
a concerted, organized
effort to get the computer?

00:30.210 --> 00:31.578
Where'd these come from?

00:31.579 --> 00:32.646
I have no idea.

00:32.647 --> 00:35.181
ELIZABETH: Someone is
stalking our kids.

emergency horns honking)

01:00.970 --> 01:02.409
HENRY: <i>Have you seen the latest</i>

01:02.410 --> 01:04.678
Hizb Al-Shahid video?

01:04.679 --> 01:06.346
Musée Du Tuareg?

01:06.347 --> 01:07.748
Algeria?

01:07.749 --> 01:09.616
HENRY: Only a matter of
time before they reach

01:09.617 --> 01:11.818
the Monastery of St. Gabriel in Djanet.

01:11.819 --> 01:13.220
It was built in the sixth century.

01:13.221 --> 01:15.088
It survived for 1,500 years.

01:15.089 --> 01:16.990
There are these statues

01:16.991 --> 01:20.427
of the apostles carved right
out of the walls of the nave.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.529
They are breathtaking.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.830
And these...

01:26.934 --> 01:29.002
There's got to be something we can do.

01:29.003 --> 01:33.473
State has a... a program to
try and protect UNESCO sites,

01:33.474 --> 01:35.542
but there's barely any funding.

01:35.543 --> 01:38.078
But, uh, Jay has the program
portfolio in his office.

01:38.079 --> 01:39.546
You can talk to him.

01:39.547 --> 01:41.515
Wait, Jay has the portfolio?

01:41.516 --> 01:45.151
That's great. Maybe you can
paper-cut them into submission.

01:47.054 --> 01:49.188
(sighs)

01:57.464 --> 02:00.500
For the record, I really
do care about this.

02:00.501 --> 02:03.370
(sighs) Even if I'm...

02:03.371 --> 02:07.740
redirecting some of my anger
because of why we're here.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.243
Sorry to keep you waiting.

02:10.244 --> 02:12.613
I just wanted to personally
make sure that the Bureau

02:12.614 --> 02:15.238
is linked in directly
with Diplomatic Security,

02:15.239 --> 02:17.384
so there won't be any
communications glitches.

02:17.385 --> 02:19.085
Thank you.

02:20.821 --> 02:23.657
Any new threat information
will be immediately relayed

02:23.658 --> 02:26.893
to your security detail and
that of your children.

02:26.894 --> 02:28.895
They'll each have two agents, 24/7.

02:28.896 --> 02:30.330
Kids are gonna love that.

02:30.331 --> 02:32.532
Make me the bad cop if you want.

02:32.533 --> 02:33.900
It's not a choice.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.736
Until we figure out
who's threatening them,

02:35.737 --> 02:37.237
it's a national security matter.

02:37.238 --> 02:39.239
How long do you think it'll take?

02:39.240 --> 02:41.141
Anonymous stalking cases

02:41.142 --> 02:44.611
are always the hardest
ones to game out.

02:44.612 --> 02:47.614
But, uh, listen, I'm a dad, too.

02:47.615 --> 02:49.182
Three girls.

02:49.183 --> 02:51.184
So I promise you, we'll keep at it

02:51.185 --> 02:53.053
till we find the sons of bitches.

02:53.054 --> 02:54.688
- Thanks, Keith. - Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:54.689 --> 02:56.223
- You bet.
- Thanks.

02:56.224 --> 02:59.693
Oh, and, uh, we'll also
need all of your devices.

02:59.694 --> 03:02.596
Phones, tablets, laptops.

03:02.597 --> 03:05.198
We need to make sure
they're not compromised.

03:05.199 --> 03:07.367
HENRY: Wow.

03:07.368 --> 03:09.069
ELIZABETH (sighs): Yeah.

03:09.070 --> 03:11.905
Well, are we sure we need to
tell the kids about this?

03:11.906 --> 03:13.573
HENRY: I don't know.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.375
Maybe we should soft-pedal it.

03:15.376 --> 03:17.844
I'm all for the soft pedal.

03:17.845 --> 03:20.480
- You sure you're good with that?
- You mean ethically?

03:20.481 --> 03:22.716
Well, you're the religion professor.

03:22.717 --> 03:24.985
Well, if it means we
don't terrify our kids,

03:24.986 --> 03:27.254
then I'm happy to be off the clock.

03:27.255 --> 03:30.557
Good. What exactly do we tell them?

03:30.558 --> 03:33.093
"Routine security escalation"?

03:33.094 --> 03:36.059
That's what Diplomatic
Security told us.

03:36.060 --> 03:38.227
With the upcoming
election and all that.

03:38.228 --> 03:39.862
Yeah, but you're not VP anymore.

03:39.863 --> 03:42.069
But she's still got a pretty big job.

03:42.070 --> 03:43.459
So is that why you
guys were out all night?

03:43.460 --> 03:44.190
HENRY: Partly.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.458
- What was the other part?
- Look, it's no big deal.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.827
Yeah, we'll each have a pair
of goons following us around?

03:48.828 --> 03:50.228
They're not goons;
they're the same folks

03:50.229 --> 03:51.396
that follow Mom everyplace.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.298
They just are expanding their domain.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.133
Just temporarily.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.701
Very convincing, Mom.

03:56.702 --> 03:58.503
Hashtag CIA training fail.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.739
Okay, hashtag over hashtag jokes.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.841
Well, if you need me,

04:02.842 --> 04:07.045
I guess you can just,
uh, call my bodyguard.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.614
- Ooh, maybe I'll have a cute one.
- (laughs) Okay.

04:09.615 --> 04:11.917
- Bye, girls.
- Love you, guys. Bye.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.119
HENRY: Jace, still need your phone.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.656
You realize your obfuscation
is an insult to my intelligence?

04:17.656 --> 04:18.822
Noted.

04:18.824 --> 04:20.524
And, look, I get it if you don't want

04:20.526 --> 04:24.061
to worry the girls, but I...
I got it, okay?

04:30.268 --> 04:31.403
(sighs)

04:31.404 --> 04:33.238
Good luck cracking the security code.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.272
- Hey!
- Jason! Jace!

04:37.509 --> 04:40.611
You're the one that
wanted to go for three.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.186
Good morning, everybody.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.088
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Madam Secretary.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.191
Your Algeria remarks are
waiting for you on your desk.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.526
Oh, thanks, Matt.

04:54.527 --> 04:57.295
I'm sure they're
appropriately momentous.

04:57.296 --> 04:59.264
Quite a healthy dollop

04:59.265 --> 05:00.432
of momentousness, ma'am,

05:00.433 --> 05:03.969
with a soupçon of historic
and extraordinary.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.470
It's a big win, ma'am.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.639
I'll say. The peaceful
transfer of power

05:07.640 --> 05:09.507
from a brutal dictator
to a popular moderate

05:09.508 --> 05:11.409
promising free elections.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.179
All while keeping a
roiling insurgency at bay

05:14.180 --> 05:16.948
as Hizb Al-Shahid terrorists
set up shop in the south.

05:16.949 --> 05:17.866
(paper bounces)

05:17.867 --> 05:20.485
DAISY: Hoping the headlines
are a tad snappier than that.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.486
JAY: I'm just saying,

05:21.487 --> 05:23.355
you don't see that every day.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.657
Ambassador Curtis
deserves all the credit.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.293
I just let him do his thing,
given his relationship

05:28.294 --> 05:29.561
with President Haddad.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.429
And where-where is Nadine?

05:31.430 --> 05:33.798
She is on the phone
in her office, ma'am.

05:33.799 --> 05:35.834
She waved me off like a thirsty fan boy

05:35.835 --> 05:37.469
when I tried to wrangle her.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.871
Does feel 20% less austere in here.

05:39.872 --> 05:40.872
(whistles)

05:40.873 --> 05:41.673
Hey.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.208
Okay, is everything

05:43.209 --> 05:45.089
on schedule for President
Haddad to go to Malta?

05:45.113 --> 05:48.847
Ambassador Curtis will depart
for Algiers this morning.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.082
He'll meet with Haddad to sign
the transfer of power accord,

05:51.083 --> 05:52.243
then they'll fly to Valletta,

05:52.244 --> 05:53.684
at which time Professor Kamel Arkoun

05:53.708 --> 05:55.320
will be sworn in as the new president.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.389
Seeds of democracy sown.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.824
Well, let's hope they get plenty of...

05:59.825 --> 06:01.459
- Sun.
- Yes, and...

06:01.460 --> 06:02.827
Moisture.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.030
- And love.
- Okay.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.133
Uh, actually, Jay, um, Henry
might be calling you about

06:08.134 --> 06:10.435
an ancient monastery in Djanet
that he's concerned about.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.404
Does he know he should
also be concerned

06:12.405 --> 06:14.406
about our lack of budget
to actually do anything...

06:14.407 --> 06:17.309
Madam Secretary, Ambassador
Curtis is on his way

06:17.310 --> 06:19.110
to the White House to resign.

06:19.111 --> 06:21.980
I thought he was on his
way to the airport

06:21.981 --> 06:23.281
to save Algeria.

06:23.282 --> 06:26.051
Yes, well, apparently, he's
more of a party loyalist

06:26.052 --> 06:27.585
than anyone realized,

06:27.586 --> 06:28.920
and he's furious with Dalton

06:28.921 --> 06:31.281
- for declaring as an independent.
- Where did you get this?

06:31.305 --> 06:32.891
His chief of staff is an old friend.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.532
Ma'am, President Haddad
made it clear that

06:34.556 --> 06:36.828
Ambassador Curtis is the only
reason he trusts this deal.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.130
I am aware. Blake, motorcade, please.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.998
Yeah.

06:44.269 --> 06:46.171
Russell. What the hell?

06:46.172 --> 06:48.039
It's called party loyalty.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.542
If you ever belonged to one,
maybe you'd understand.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.677
Here I thought loyalty
to country was enough.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.779
Yeah. I stalled his
car at security gate,

06:54.780 --> 06:56.514
but Roy Curtis is no shrinking violet.

06:56.515 --> 06:57.849
I'm well aware.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.785
Listen, I'm sorry about this
business with your family.

07:00.786 --> 07:02.719
Thank you. I...

07:04.923 --> 07:07.459
- Get the hell out of my way, Russell.
- Roy.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.727
What a delightful surprise.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.161
President knows I'm coming.

07:10.162 --> 07:12.831
Ah, sadly, he had to
step in to a briefing.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.300
Oh, he stepped in it, all right.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.602
If he wants to blow me off,
then you can just

07:17.603 --> 07:19.738
give him this.

07:19.739 --> 07:23.308
Why don't we wait for the
president in my office.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.409
I'll bust out the civet coffee.

07:27.112 --> 07:28.546
Fine.

07:28.547 --> 07:30.881
But caffeine just makes me angrier.

07:38.723 --> 07:39.724
Henry.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.393
(chuckles) Welcome to the Pentagon.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.428
Hey, pal. They kick you
out of the White House

07:43.429 --> 07:44.529
for drinking the president's coffee?

07:44.530 --> 07:46.464
- Hey, that just happened once...
- Oh, right.

07:46.465 --> 07:47.932
...and, uh, I needed the elbow room

07:47.933 --> 07:49.401
to take down terrorist networks.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.802
Black Dog Station. Ruff.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.837
I can clear you for an access badge.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.339
Takes five minutes.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.840
Set you up with a desk.

07:55.841 --> 07:58.543
How about I buy you lunch instead?

07:58.544 --> 08:01.479
Memory serves, a touch of cream.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.415
Isn't that right, Roy?

08:03.416 --> 08:06.717
Charm just looks creepy
on you, Russell.

08:07.452 --> 08:08.987
ELIZABETH: What can we do

08:08.988 --> 08:10.321
for you, Roy?

08:10.322 --> 08:11.856
We share the same goals.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.458
We want to make this right.

08:13.459 --> 08:14.793
CURTIS: First rule of diplomacy:

08:14.794 --> 08:16.361
gain trust.

08:16.362 --> 08:18.930
I know your playbook, ma'am.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.398
I wrote it.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.766
And here we go.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.935
Ah.

08:23.936 --> 08:24.969
Thank you.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.205
CURTIS: Mmm.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.575
Madam Secretary, do you know
why civet coffee isn't bitter?

08:30.576 --> 08:31.943
No, I don't.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.145
Th-The beans are gnawed on

08:34.145 --> 08:37.682
and digested by little
animals called civets,

08:37.683 --> 08:41.186
but the bean's core is too
hard to digest fully,

08:41.187 --> 08:43.488
so eventually they poop it out.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.889
Farmers gather them.

08:44.890 --> 08:48.059
Because the bitter outside
is already eaten away,

08:48.060 --> 08:50.428
they don't need to be roasted too long,

08:50.429 --> 08:52.730
preserving the natural sugar...

08:52.731 --> 08:54.731
and complexity.

08:56.668 --> 09:00.171
I always thought it was a
good metaphor for what I do...

09:00.172 --> 09:03.308
getting foreign leaders to eat
a plate of crap and like it.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.009
(chuckles)

09:05.010 --> 09:07.312
But I don't like eating it myself,

09:07.313 --> 09:09.214
especially from my own president.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.749
And I've been a party loyalist

09:11.750 --> 09:14.686
for over 40 years, and
I intend to die one.

09:14.687 --> 09:18.156
Dalton running as an independent
is the biggest case of

09:18.157 --> 09:20.158
traitorism I've ever seen,

09:20.159 --> 09:22.060
and I simply won't be a part of it.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.829
Your job as a foreign service
officer is apolitical.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.599
It's unethical for you
to let politics unravel

09:27.600 --> 09:29.968
a vital deal that you
brokered on behalf of the...

09:29.969 --> 09:32.437
You're damn right I
did, no thanks to you!

09:32.438 --> 09:34.405
And Dalton.

09:34.406 --> 09:37.876
And your new namby-pamby
softball vision

09:37.877 --> 09:40.144
of foreign policy!

09:40.145 --> 09:42.380
You think I sat in a circle with Haddad

09:42.381 --> 09:44.349
and made friendship bracelets?

09:44.350 --> 09:47.318
I got in his face; I told him
he'd lose a civil war,

09:47.319 --> 09:50.321
get captured by an angry mob

09:50.322 --> 09:52.423
that'd yank out his fingernails,
cut off his nuts,

09:52.424 --> 09:54.192
and hang him in the Place de l'Emir!

09:54.193 --> 09:56.895
It was your finest moment.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.531
You are the only person
in the diplomatic corps

09:59.532 --> 10:03.101
with the skill,
connections and intelligence

10:03.102 --> 10:05.103
to have made it happen.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.106
Now you're appealing to
my well-documented ego.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.787
Well, then let's just
stick with the facts:

10:09.811 --> 10:12.410
you <i>are</i> the linchpin of
the deal with Haddad.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.480
Without you, hundreds of
thousands of lives will be lost.

10:15.481 --> 10:18.216
You have a beef with Dalton,
you want to give him

10:18.217 --> 10:20.919
a piece of your mind, Russell
can put that on the books.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.955
But do it after you deliver
Haddad out of Algeria.

10:26.558 --> 10:28.126
JOSE: <i>I think you're right.</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:30.762
It's end times for the monastery.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.764
Unless we do something about it.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.767
There's no "we" in antiquities.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.969
I hunt terrorists, not tchotchkes.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.138
I don't see why they should
be mutually exclusive.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.873
How many times have these groups used

10:41.874 --> 10:43.741
the destruction of heretical artifacts

10:43.742 --> 10:45.710
as propaganda to recruit fighters?

10:45.711 --> 10:47.445
It happened in Afghanistan

10:47.446 --> 10:50.048
when the Taliban destroyed
the Buddhas of Bamiyan.

10:50.049 --> 10:54.485
And in Syria, ISIS blew up
the ancient ruins of Palmyra.

10:54.486 --> 10:57.789
And now Hizb Al-Shahid is using
the same tactic in Algeria.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.258
So you think preserving the monastery

11:00.259 --> 11:01.726
could help slow the momentum?

11:01.727 --> 11:04.461
I think it's a piece
of the puzzle, yeah.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.432
What do you want from me?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.768
Money.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.971
State has a working group,
but it's underfunded.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.206
If you could convince your higher-ups

11:15.207 --> 11:17.809
to reprogram part of the budget,

11:17.810 --> 11:19.644
we could do a joint operation.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.646
Save the monastery, save Algeria.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.615
You sure this isn't

11:23.616 --> 11:26.117
just a religion professor
doing everything he can

11:26.118 --> 11:28.119
to rescue an old church?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.022
Look, if you're asking me if I
have an emotional stake in this,

11:31.023 --> 11:33.091
the answer is: you're damn right I do.

11:33.092 --> 11:36.327
But I also firmly believe
that by saving it,

11:36.328 --> 11:39.163
we could disrupt HS
in southern Algeria.

11:39.164 --> 11:42.365
Which is what Black Dog
Station is all about, isn't it?

11:45.236 --> 11:47.505
CURTIS: Off to Algiers I go!

11:47.506 --> 11:49.340
Like a dutiful servant.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.609
MARY: Sounds like Tuesday.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.445
Well, yeah, but last Tuesday

11:54.446 --> 11:57.982
I wasn't working for
President Turncoat Dalton

11:57.983 --> 12:02.020
and his little Iago-esque
puppet master Elizabeth McCord.

12:02.021 --> 12:03.454
I thought you liked her.

12:03.455 --> 12:05.556
Oh, she had me fooled, too.

12:05.557 --> 12:08.393
Yeah, with her realpolitik.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.195
But she's just a blonde Yoko Ono,

12:11.196 --> 12:14.899
making an administration
over in her Kumbaya,

12:14.900 --> 12:16.467
peace-on-Earth

12:16.468 --> 12:17.635
baloney.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.837
You know when we'll have
peace on Earth, Mary?

12:19.838 --> 12:22.240
After we nuke ourselves
to kingdom come, dear.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.542
That's right. And until then,

12:24.543 --> 12:28.046
the only meaningful diplomacy is...
(chuckles)

12:28.047 --> 12:30.915
is achieved when our adversaries

12:30.916 --> 12:33.418
begin to feel their own mortality.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.552
Feet to the fire.

12:39.891 --> 12:42.859
I said feet to the fire, darling.

12:43.561 --> 12:45.562
(thump)

12:56.708 --> 12:58.276
(elevator bell dings)

12:58.277 --> 13:00.011
Good afternoon, Madam Secretary.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.713
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.274
Well, I received an interesting message

13:03.298 --> 13:07.018
from Agent Santangelo at the FBI.

13:07.019 --> 13:10.221
Um... what did he say?

13:10.222 --> 13:14.057
Uh, Th-they need to know
the code for Jason's phone.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.062
- (sighs)
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.465
Why does the FBI have
Jason's phone, ma'am?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.834
He didn't do anything, Blake.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.155
No. No, no, no. Of-of course not.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.170
Why can't the FBI just crack the code?

13:26.171 --> 13:28.673
I mean, isn't that what they do? Wha...

13:28.674 --> 13:31.442
- Oh, that doesn't look good.
- No.

13:31.443 --> 13:34.477
Ma'am, the president urgently
needs you at the White House.

13:36.214 --> 13:39.282
The excitement never ends.

13:40.418 --> 13:43.488
His wife Mary said he
was ranting about us

13:43.489 --> 13:45.389
right before he collapsed.

13:45.390 --> 13:48.526
DALTON: Well, at least he
died doing what he loved.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.096
He was a good man, and his death
should be mourned properly,

13:52.097 --> 13:53.331
but, uh...

13:53.332 --> 13:55.666
But right now we need
to save our Algeria deal.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.335
Well, Haddad's already intimating

13:57.336 --> 14:00.104
that we had Curtis killed
to spike the deal.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.106
That makes no sense.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.642
Haddad has a tenuous
relationship with sense.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.611
All he knows is power.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.579
And it sure sounds
like he's looking for

14:08.580 --> 14:09.881
an excuse to maintain it.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.917
If he does, it'll be civil war.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.852
And beyond the suffering
of the Algerian people,

14:14.853 --> 14:17.255
the world can't afford another Syria

14:17.256 --> 14:18.756
right on Europe's doorstep.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.459
We have no choice but to
try and salvage this deal.

14:23.628 --> 14:24.595
(sighs)

14:24.596 --> 14:27.197
I'll go to Algiers.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.737
And how exactly do you plan to
make President Haddad trust you?

14:32.738 --> 14:35.273
The man's impulsive, paranoid,

14:35.274 --> 14:36.607
unstable.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.676
Sounds like a teenager.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.778
I deal with those every day.

14:40.779 --> 14:44.115
You can't send a brutal
dictator to his room.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.516
I don't have to.

14:45.517 --> 14:48.151
Just to exile.

14:49.821 --> 14:51.988
What if he won't go?

15:00.832 --> 15:08.006
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by

15:13.446 --> 15:15.213
(elevator bell dings)

15:15.696 --> 15:16.697
Henry.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.766
- Good to see you.
- Jay.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.668
I know what you're thinking.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.737
State doesn't have the resources
to save the monastery.

15:23.738 --> 15:27.007
Religious scholar,
Marine pilot and psychic.

15:27.008 --> 15:30.210
Well... I've got two words for you:

15:30.211 --> 15:31.946
counterterrorism funding.

15:31.947 --> 15:33.814
JAY: <i>And this is a done deal?</i>

15:33.815 --> 15:35.249
Money's already been reprogrammed

15:35.250 --> 15:37.084
to an Ongoing Operations account.

15:37.085 --> 15:39.587
It's ingenious bureaucratic jujitsu,

15:39.588 --> 15:42.289
but I don't think any amount of
money can save the monastery.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.425
Look, I'm aware that the
instability in the middle

15:44.426 --> 15:47.528
of the country has left the
south under the control of HS.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.630
Exactly. So even if we muster up

15:49.631 --> 15:51.031
sufficient force protection,
it's too dangerous

15:51.032 --> 15:53.334
to leave boots on the ground
for an extended period.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.703
I figured as much, but
here's what we <i>can</i> do.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.771
We can send in a UNESCO recovery team

15:57.772 --> 16:00.307
to remove the statues of the apostles.

16:00.308 --> 16:02.776
They're the most famous
feature of the site,

16:02.777 --> 16:05.112
carved right into the nave walls.

16:05.113 --> 16:08.515
But they could be detached
with a masonry saw.

16:08.516 --> 16:12.752
It's not ideal, but... it's
better than losing them forever.

16:13.921 --> 16:16.624
(sighs): Okay. Okay.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.926
We'll need permission from
the Algerian government.

16:18.927 --> 16:21.161
And the UNESCO team will
need a security force.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.097
Which we can now afford.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.531
I'll get into it.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.833
Thanks, Jay.

16:27.835 --> 16:29.103
(knocking)

16:29.104 --> 16:30.304
Hey.

16:30.305 --> 16:31.805
Hi.

16:31.806 --> 16:35.042
Jay give you our sad budget sitch?

16:35.043 --> 16:36.777
Yeah, but we're trying something.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.445
Well, that's good.

16:38.446 --> 16:42.182
So, are you cool with
the Justice Department

16:42.183 --> 16:43.917
subpoenaing our son?

16:43.918 --> 16:47.421
So, the FBI can't crack his phone code?

16:47.422 --> 16:48.789
Bingo.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.792
I'd talk to him, but I have to
go stop a bloody civil war.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.595
I'll put the screws to him.
He'll be begging for his mommy.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.664
Perfect. I'll be in Algeria.

16:56.665 --> 16:58.766
(chuckles) Ah, see how that works?

16:58.767 --> 17:00.934
You know, I don't know
who's got the tougher job,

17:00.935 --> 17:03.537
but I'll take a brutal
dictator any day.

17:03.538 --> 17:06.073
Oh, look at us...
functioning moderately well.

17:06.074 --> 17:08.809
(chuckles) Just keep lowering that bar.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.010
HENRY: <i>All clear, girls.</i>

17:11.545 --> 17:13.814
Thanks for your cooperation.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.784
Thank God. I felt like I
was missing a limb all day.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.919
You might want reflect
on that just a little.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.220
No, I'm good.

17:20.221 --> 17:21.855
Since when do we have so many devices?

17:21.856 --> 17:24.023
Since when did we give up our
Fourth Amendment rights?

17:24.025 --> 17:25.959
Here we go.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.127
The Fourth Amendment protects against

17:27.127 --> 17:28.762
"unreasonable" searches and seizures.

17:28.763 --> 17:30.631
Exactly. It's unreasonable if
there isn't probable cause.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.032
How do you know there isn't?

17:32.033 --> 17:33.467
That's the point, dummy.

17:33.468 --> 17:35.736
We don't know because the
<i>Stasi</i> here won't tell us.

17:35.737 --> 17:37.337
All right, that's enough, Jason.

17:37.338 --> 17:39.707
I need the security code to your phone.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.809
And I'm not gonna ask you twice.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.710
You can ask as many times
as you want; I'm not giving it.

17:45.446 --> 17:47.681
Okay, you're grounded for a month.

17:47.682 --> 17:50.482
- What?! Dad... Dad, are you serious?!
- Unless you want to go for two.

17:50.506 --> 17:51.618
You want to go for two?

17:51.619 --> 17:53.220
- Dad...
- Give me the code.

17:53.221 --> 17:54.701
Dad, you of all people should respect

17:54.725 --> 17:56.223
that I'm taking a principled stand.

17:56.224 --> 17:58.058
I mean, isn't that what all your
heroes did, like Thomas Becket

17:58.059 --> 18:00.294
- or St. Sebastian or Gandhi? Hey, hey.
- Really, dude?

18:00.295 --> 18:02.162
At least someone in this
family still has integrity.

18:02.163 --> 18:04.198
You know the only reason you're
taking such a "principled stand"

18:04.199 --> 18:05.432
is because you want to keep hiding

18:05.433 --> 18:06.900
your secret Instagram
account from Mom and Dad.

18:06.901 --> 18:08.068
I'm gonna kill you! You know that?

18:08.069 --> 18:09.903
- You are so dead!
- Is that true? Is that true?!

18:09.904 --> 18:11.805
- Yes. But that's not the point.
- Okay, we'll deal with that later.

18:11.806 --> 18:13.240
- The point... I...
- But for now,

18:13.241 --> 18:14.941
give me the code.

18:16.143 --> 18:17.877
(sighs)

18:19.146 --> 18:21.482
Fine. Take it.

18:21.483 --> 18:24.123
Take the Constitution while you're
at it. (chalk clatters on floor)

18:24.124 --> 18:26.258
Give me up to the thought
police and torture me

18:26.259 --> 18:29.088
till I'm saluting a
portrait of Big Brother.

18:30.157 --> 18:32.525
♪

18:35.262 --> 18:37.798
(Elizabeth groans)

18:37.799 --> 18:39.166
Oh.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.268
I don't understand.

18:41.269 --> 18:43.604
We gave him the drinking talk.

18:43.605 --> 18:46.639
HENRY: Apparently, it didn't take.

18:47.407 --> 18:49.676
Nadine's making a face.

18:49.677 --> 18:51.845
Maybe...

18:51.846 --> 18:54.213
we needed more than one talk.

18:57.818 --> 19:01.188
Now Blake is pointedly
avoiding eye contact.

19:01.189 --> 19:02.222
Well...

19:02.223 --> 19:04.124
he's already grounded for a month.

19:04.125 --> 19:07.361
We can wait till you get home
to give him the <i>big</i> talking to.

19:07.362 --> 19:08.595
Okay.

19:08.596 --> 19:10.364
I'm afraid to say anything else,

19:10.365 --> 19:13.000
lest the mime troupe weighs in again.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.768
AGENT MATT: Excuse me, Madam Secretary?

19:14.769 --> 19:16.703
There's been a change of plans.

19:16.704 --> 19:19.740
Henry, I got to go.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.743
Thank you for dealing
with our delinquent.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.911
Be safe.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.212
Love you.

19:25.213 --> 19:27.815
Yeah.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.716
- What's up, Matt?
- Algerian DGSP

19:29.717 --> 19:31.957
just informed us that instead
of the Presidential Palace,

19:31.981 --> 19:33.720
President Haddad would like to meet you

19:33.721 --> 19:35.621
at the Ministry of Defense.

19:38.325 --> 19:40.861
It's unusual, ma'am.

19:40.862 --> 19:43.997
But... so is President Haddad.

19:43.998 --> 19:46.500
It sounds like a power play.

19:46.501 --> 19:48.235
Yeah.

19:48.236 --> 19:51.138
How are we feeling about it
from a security standpoint?

19:51.139 --> 19:53.473
It's acceptable, ma'am.

19:53.474 --> 19:55.408
Our new route is being cleared.

19:57.678 --> 19:59.845
Okay, then.

20:05.519 --> 20:07.788
President Haddad.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.223
Good morning.

20:09.224 --> 20:12.626
Thank you so much for meeting with me.

20:12.627 --> 20:14.695
Madam, uh...

20:14.696 --> 20:17.965
I was expecting my friend, Roy Curtis.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.534
President Dalton sends his condolences.

20:20.535 --> 20:22.469
We mourn his loss along with you.

20:22.470 --> 20:23.903
Do you?

20:25.038 --> 20:28.609
Or are you just here to push me out?

20:28.610 --> 20:32.613
I'm here to express our
most profound respect

20:32.614 --> 20:34.214
for your bold, selfless

20:34.215 --> 20:37.249
and historic leadership of Algeria.

20:38.852 --> 20:40.988
Madam, allow me

20:40.989 --> 20:45.292
to introduce, uh,
General Mourad Cherat.

20:45.293 --> 20:47.494
My chief of staff of the military.

20:47.495 --> 20:49.930
We have known each other
since we were boys.

20:49.931 --> 20:52.633
We were, uh, lab partners

20:52.634 --> 20:54.935
in biology class.

20:54.936 --> 20:57.537
Dissected mice together.

20:57.538 --> 20:59.439
General Cherat, good to meet you.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.974
Secretary McCord.

21:00.975 --> 21:03.142
And, um...

21:05.746 --> 21:07.714
The rest of them do not matter.

21:07.715 --> 21:08.916
Coffee?

21:08.917 --> 21:11.585
Y-Yes, thank you. That's...

21:11.586 --> 21:12.552
Please.

21:12.553 --> 21:14.821
Uh, is Professor Arkoun on his way?

21:14.822 --> 21:17.189
Is Roy Curtis on his way?

21:18.892 --> 21:20.527
ELIZABETH: <i>Mr. President,</i>

21:20.528 --> 21:25.631
we... deeply regret
Ambassador Curtis's passing.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.368
He was murdered by your government.

21:28.369 --> 21:32.439
I know about your CIA's
targeted killings.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.242
Roy... was more than a friend.

21:35.243 --> 21:36.576
He was a brother.

21:36.577 --> 21:40.781
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.

21:40.782 --> 21:42.215
Can you check on

21:42.216 --> 21:43.150
Arkoun's status?

21:43.151 --> 21:44.618
Professor Arkoun

21:44.619 --> 21:47.286
will not be joining us.

21:48.455 --> 21:54.261
Mr. President, uh, with respect,
Arkoun has to be here

21:54.262 --> 21:58.031
to sign the accord for
the transfer of power.

21:58.032 --> 21:59.967
The man is a traitor.

21:59.968 --> 22:03.502
He confessed to his crimes
against the state this morning.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.931
_

22:11.812 --> 22:13.380
Now you can see

22:13.381 --> 22:17.584
why the distinguished
professor cannot be joining us.

22:17.585 --> 22:19.353
Mr. President, if you let this happen,

22:19.354 --> 22:21.355
it will lead to your ouster and death.

22:21.356 --> 22:24.391
That is exactly what you were
trying to avoid by making

22:24.392 --> 22:26.259
the agreement to abdicate
in the first place.

22:26.260 --> 22:30.130
Madam, do you think I am a fool?

22:30.131 --> 22:33.967
If I get on your plane, you
will take me to The Hague.

22:33.968 --> 22:35.402
That is not...

22:35.403 --> 22:37.471
You never had any intention
of honoring our deal!

22:37.472 --> 22:41.408
We fully intend to honor it and
take you to Malta as agreed.

22:41.409 --> 22:43.276
Now, for your own safety

22:43.277 --> 22:46.346
and the good of your people,
do not let this happen.

22:46.347 --> 22:49.116
You must leave Algeria.

22:49.117 --> 22:52.351
I <i>am</i> Algeria.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.440
_

22:54.441 --> 22:56.890
ELIZABETH: Don't do this. Don't do...

22:56.891 --> 22:59.091
(thump, Arkoun grunts)

23:00.293 --> 23:03.430
And tell Dalton no deal.

23:03.431 --> 23:05.499
And Haddad will never

23:05.500 --> 23:08.300
leave Algeria!

23:17.934 --> 23:19.427
ELIZABETH: It was a setup,

23:19.428 --> 23:20.895
intended to weaken our resolve.

23:20.896 --> 23:22.363
DALTON: And now the one man

23:22.364 --> 23:24.532
who can unify the country is dead.

23:24.533 --> 23:27.135
Mr. President, our satellites
are showing Algeria's military

23:27.136 --> 23:29.104
mobilizing to move on

23:29.105 --> 23:31.106
the insurgents' stronghold of Tindouf.

23:31.107 --> 23:33.041
Where there are 10,000 rebels

23:33.042 --> 23:35.443
and 40,000 civilians who'll be no match

23:35.444 --> 23:37.011
for Haddad's tank brigade.

23:37.012 --> 23:39.047
That's right. It'll be a massacre, sir.

23:39.048 --> 23:41.583
ELIZABETH: How long until
they reach Tindouf, Ellen?

23:41.584 --> 23:43.051
About 48 hours.

23:43.052 --> 23:45.920
Well, then that's how long
we have to draw up plans

23:45.921 --> 23:47.388
to stop him.

23:47.389 --> 23:50.125
You want to strike a nation
that poses no immediate threat

23:50.126 --> 23:51.426
to the United States?

23:51.427 --> 23:53.695
Russell, just two days ago,

23:53.696 --> 23:56.865
you were saying that we can't
afford another failed state

23:56.866 --> 23:58.133
this close to Europe.

23:58.134 --> 24:01.035
I'll take a failed state
over an even worse debacle

24:01.036 --> 24:02.003
of our making.

24:02.004 --> 24:03.364
(chuckles): What the hell happened

24:03.388 --> 24:06.007
to your new era of
principled foreign policy?

24:06.008 --> 24:07.275
There is nothing unprincipled

24:07.276 --> 24:09.244
about trying to save 50,000 lives.

24:09.245 --> 24:13.435
And I never said anything
about outright pacifism.

24:13.436 --> 24:14.996
And what about the
hundreds of thousands

24:15.020 --> 24:17.153
who are gonna die when
the rebels move on Algiers?

24:17.154 --> 24:19.223
Which will inevitably
embolden Hizb Al-Shahid

24:19.224 --> 24:22.259
to move up from the south,
leaving a failed state anyway.

24:22.260 --> 24:23.108
Remember Libya?

24:23.109 --> 24:25.354
Haven't we all seen this movie
too many times already?

24:25.355 --> 24:27.190
This is exactly the kind of thinking

24:27.191 --> 24:28.357
that Haddad is counting on.

24:28.358 --> 24:29.491
And the next thing you know,

24:29.492 --> 24:31.683
we're in a ground war
in an election year.

24:31.684 --> 24:32.965
Are you telling me we can't keep

24:33.130 --> 24:34.530
the world safe in an election year?

24:34.531 --> 24:37.366
No, I'm telling you the last
thing our country needs

24:37.367 --> 24:39.634
is a North African sequel to Iraq.

24:40.836 --> 24:43.972
Look, you heard what
Curtis said about Haddad.

24:43.973 --> 24:46.174
And based on what I've just seen,

24:46.175 --> 24:50.178
a show of strength is our only
hope of changing his mind

24:50.179 --> 24:51.547
and avoiding a war.

24:51.548 --> 24:53.815
That's a hell of a gamble,
counting on a madman

24:53.816 --> 24:56.218
- to change his mind.
- All right.

24:56.219 --> 25:00.055
Obviously, there are no easy solutions.

25:00.056 --> 25:02.391
But I'm more sympathetic
to Bess's view.

25:02.392 --> 25:04.059
The world really can't afford

25:04.060 --> 25:06.428
another Mediterranean
nation falling apart.

25:06.429 --> 25:08.530
Now, we can't move unilaterally, so...

25:08.531 --> 25:12.067
let's reach out to NATO and our
other allies in the region,

25:12.068 --> 25:14.269
see if we can build a coalition.

25:14.270 --> 25:15.971
Yes, sir.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.473
NEWSMAN: <i>Military sources
tell us that President Haddad</i>

25:18.474 --> 25:21.009
has followed up this execution
with a new ground offensive

25:21.010 --> 25:22.611
- in rebel-held territory.
- Hey.

25:22.612 --> 25:23.732
JAY: Elizabeth's in the air.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.408
- Already cleared Algerian airspace.
- I talked to her. Thanks.

25:26.409 --> 25:28.277
Hell of a thing.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.139
Yeah. Look, I know the political

25:30.140 --> 25:31.907
and logistical part of
this is a nightmare,

25:31.908 --> 25:35.010
but it doesn't mean we have
to give up on the monastery.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.246
The Algerians already did that for us.

25:37.247 --> 25:38.414
What? What do you mean?

25:38.415 --> 25:40.149
Their military officially
pulled the plug.

25:40.150 --> 25:43.319
Diverted all resources to the
impending fight in Tindouf.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.521
Without their security guarantees,

25:45.522 --> 25:48.590
UNESCO won't send
the archeological team.

25:49.325 --> 25:51.460
I'm sorry, Henry.

25:51.461 --> 25:54.430
(chuckles) You know...

25:54.431 --> 25:56.365
people often say that Napoleon's army

25:56.366 --> 25:59.301
shot off the Sphinx's
nose as target practice.

25:59.302 --> 26:00.642
But it's apocryphal.

26:00.808 --> 26:03.986
Yeah, Napoleon stole a lot of artifacts

26:03.987 --> 26:05.354
on his way through Giza,

26:05.355 --> 26:07.823
but he also purposely kept the Sphinx

26:07.824 --> 26:09.892
and the pyramids intact.

26:09.893 --> 26:12.127
He even hired artists to sketch them

26:12.128 --> 26:14.630
so the people of France could
marvel at their grandeur.

26:14.631 --> 26:19.668
Protecting the world's
treasures matters.

26:19.669 --> 26:22.069
Even during war.

26:23.972 --> 26:25.707
What...

26:25.708 --> 26:27.742
What can we do?

26:29.244 --> 26:31.346
Okay, what if there were elements

26:31.347 --> 26:32.448
in the Algerian military

26:32.449 --> 26:35.217
who were amenable to
back-channel negotiations?

26:35.218 --> 26:37.619
My colleague, Jose Campos at DIA,

26:37.620 --> 26:40.089
- is invested in this.
- We're literally...

26:40.090 --> 26:41.857
He could... he could
facilitate the process.

26:41.858 --> 26:45.293
...literally gearing up for
war with Algeria as we speak.

26:47.596 --> 26:50.232
(chuckles softly) But yeah.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.533
I guess we can take a shot.

26:54.103 --> 26:56.872
Not at the Sphinx's nose.

26:56.873 --> 26:59.308
We'll take a shot.

26:59.309 --> 27:01.743
MATT: Look at him.

27:01.744 --> 27:05.647
The guy negotiated peace in
every corner of the planet,

27:05.648 --> 27:07.716
was revered by his peers.

27:07.717 --> 27:08.817
For what?

27:08.818 --> 27:11.286
Country. Humanity.

27:11.287 --> 27:14.623
Yeah, I guess.

27:14.624 --> 27:16.291
I hate death.

27:16.292 --> 27:18.026
So, how you guys doing?

27:18.027 --> 27:20.329
You mean after seeing a man hanged?

27:20.330 --> 27:23.297
As well as can be expected, I guess.

27:24.701 --> 27:26.034
MATT: Oh, man.

27:26.035 --> 27:29.104
Who invited Jessica Rabbit?

27:29.105 --> 27:30.639
NADINE: Algeria did.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.341
That's Salima Tengour.

27:32.342 --> 27:35.177
She's their official
representative to the funeral.

27:35.178 --> 27:38.013
I-I'm surprised that
they're even allowed one.

27:38.014 --> 27:40.315
Well, we tend to give a bit of leeway

27:40.316 --> 27:41.783
when it comes to paying respects.

27:41.784 --> 27:44.052
Isn't she President Haddad's mistress?

27:44.053 --> 27:48.157
And also his Minister
of Internal Affairs.

27:48.158 --> 27:49.625
Oh, God.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.994
Haddad has 11 wives.
Why does he need a mistress?

27:51.995 --> 27:54.228
Have you met men?

27:59.301 --> 28:00.802
Welcome back, Bess.

28:00.803 --> 28:03.772
How is our coalition coming together?

28:03.773 --> 28:07.776
I'm expecting commitments
from all of NATO and...

28:07.777 --> 28:11.013
Tunisia, Morocco and
Saudi Arabia by morning.

28:11.014 --> 28:12.614
Giving us plenty of
time to start hitting

28:12.638 --> 28:14.983
Haddad's tank columns by the afternoon,

28:14.984 --> 28:16.785
before they reach Tindouf.

28:16.786 --> 28:20.421
Good. I want to bring in as
many countries as possible.

28:21.890 --> 28:24.693
Mary. Sorry to be talking shop.

28:24.694 --> 28:25.894
No need to apologize.

28:25.895 --> 28:27.029
Roy wouldn't have it

28:27.030 --> 28:28.297
any other way.

28:28.298 --> 28:29.464
Hello, Jonathan.

28:29.465 --> 28:31.800
SALIMA: Mr. President.

28:31.801 --> 28:33.368
Madam Secretary.

28:33.369 --> 28:35.237
And dear Mrs. Curtis.

28:35.238 --> 28:36.672
Allow me to convey

28:36.673 --> 28:38.640
the People's Democratic
Republic of Algeria's

28:38.641 --> 28:41.076
and His Excellency
President Aman Haddad's

28:41.077 --> 28:43.312
deepest and most profound sympathies

28:43.313 --> 28:45.981
on the loss of his
beloved friend, Roy Curtis.

28:45.982 --> 28:48.050
Thank you.

28:48.051 --> 28:49.751
Thank you, Minister.

28:49.752 --> 28:53.088
And please tell the president
there is still time to talk.

28:53.089 --> 28:55.023
I think we can all agree that

28:55.024 --> 28:57.059
that would be the best way to honor

28:57.060 --> 28:59.194
Ambassador Curtis's memory.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.163
SALIMA: Indeed, Mr. President.

29:01.164 --> 29:03.398
In fact, His Excellency
asked me to pass along word

29:03.399 --> 29:06.467
that he would welcome
such communication.

29:10.392 --> 29:15.244
After careful consideration, uh,
I'm willing to enact the reforms

29:15.245 --> 29:17.312
that the insurgents have demanded.

29:17.313 --> 29:19.081
Well, I am glad to hear that.

29:19.082 --> 29:20.916
Now, you need to call off your troops

29:20.917 --> 29:22.951
and get on a plane to Malta.

29:22.952 --> 29:24.886
No. No.

29:24.887 --> 29:27.356
Who will lead if I'm gone?

29:27.357 --> 29:29.625
Well, you murdered

29:29.626 --> 29:31.793
the one man everyone agreed on.

29:31.794 --> 29:33.954
But we will cobble together
a provisional government...

29:33.978 --> 29:34.963
Nonsense.

29:34.964 --> 29:38.367
Algeria needs a leader.

29:38.368 --> 29:40.235
I will call for elections.

29:40.236 --> 29:44.072
My people should have
the chance to choose me.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.807
Do I really need to remind you

29:45.808 --> 29:47.442
that at the beginning of negotiations,

29:47.443 --> 29:49.411
the insurgency demanded

29:49.412 --> 29:51.079
your head?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.180
There is no chance

29:52.181 --> 29:54.383
that they will accept
you staying in power.

29:54.384 --> 29:56.818
Now, you need to get
on that plane to Malta.

29:56.819 --> 30:00.322
That is the only deal
that is available to you.

30:00.323 --> 30:02.224
Fine.

30:02.225 --> 30:05.894
But I hate talking like this.

30:05.895 --> 30:07.863
Come back to Algiers,

30:07.864 --> 30:11.667
and, uh, we can discuss
all these options.

30:11.668 --> 30:13.568
I'm always willing to talk.

30:13.569 --> 30:16.672
But given when just happened
when I came to Algiers, no.

30:16.673 --> 30:19.074
I'm-I'm not coming back.

30:19.075 --> 30:21.276
But I am willing to meet
with you in Geneva.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.544
Impossible.

30:22.545 --> 30:26.981
I cannot leave my people
during such a difficult time.

30:29.151 --> 30:31.519
We have nothing left to discuss.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.282
HENRY: <i>Hey.</i>

30:39.283 --> 30:41.295
(sighs)

30:42.998 --> 30:44.766
Are we really doing this?

30:44.767 --> 30:46.535
He gets home in an hour.

30:46.536 --> 30:47.769
(sighs)

30:47.770 --> 30:49.504
He'll never know what hit him.

30:49.505 --> 30:51.105
Welcome home.

30:52.641 --> 30:54.710
Oh, you've always been

30:54.711 --> 30:58.613
such a fantastic welcoming committee.

30:58.614 --> 31:00.615
Keep welcoming me on
the couch, will you?

31:00.616 --> 31:02.451
Sure you can be away from the office?

31:02.452 --> 31:05.187
I know. You'd think I'd have more to do

31:05.188 --> 31:07.389
in the lead-up to war,

31:07.390 --> 31:10.859
but it's mostly DoD at this point.

31:10.860 --> 31:14.162
Speaking of war, we're in agreement.

31:14.163 --> 31:16.832
Jason's grounded for two months, yeah?

31:16.833 --> 31:18.934
Toast. Make him cry.

31:18.935 --> 31:20.869
(chuckles)

31:20.870 --> 31:23.405
But am I...?

31:23.406 --> 31:26.341
Am I crazy for thinking
that it could be worse?

31:26.342 --> 31:28.110
With a mysterious stalker out there

31:28.111 --> 31:30.212
- and the country on the brink of war?
- (chuckles)

31:30.213 --> 31:31.812
There's a chance you're not crazy.

31:33.548 --> 31:35.650
I'm sorry about that monastery.

31:35.651 --> 31:37.285
Mm.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.756
Jay said that you fought the
good fight right up to the end.

31:40.757 --> 31:43.658
Yeah, we came so close to
saving at least some of it.

31:43.659 --> 31:45.594
We even got the head of
the Algerian military

31:45.595 --> 31:47.596
to agree to let our UNESCO team in,

31:47.597 --> 31:49.164
but then UNESCO decided it wasn't safe,

31:49.165 --> 31:50.485
- so they pulled the plug.
- Wait.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.201
What head of the
Algerian military? What?

31:53.202 --> 31:56.171
The general. Um...

31:56.172 --> 31:57.406
Cherat.

31:57.407 --> 32:00.976
You spoke to General Cherat?

32:00.977 --> 32:04.745
Not me personally, but he
was cooperating with DoD.

32:06.114 --> 32:07.449
You're sure?

32:07.450 --> 32:09.818
He-he's working with the U.S.?

32:09.819 --> 32:12.419
Oh... yeah.

32:14.022 --> 32:14.956
(line ringing)

32:14.957 --> 32:17.592
(chuckles): No, wait.

32:17.593 --> 32:19.194
- Blake.
- BLAKE: Yes, ma'am?

32:19.195 --> 32:20.996
Come on. (stammers) Listen, Blake.

32:20.997 --> 32:22.731
Will you, um...

32:22.732 --> 32:24.800
You tell President Haddad
I'll meet with him

32:24.801 --> 32:26.535
in Algiers first thing in the morning.

32:26.536 --> 32:30.205
And get me DIA's military
leadership profile

32:30.206 --> 32:31.840
- on General Cherat.
- Yes, ma'am.

32:31.841 --> 32:33.375
I am really sorry.

32:33.376 --> 32:36.378
I'm playing the Algerian card again,

32:36.379 --> 32:40.081
so you're gonna have to kick
Jason's ass all on your own.

32:40.082 --> 32:41.316
Just wait a minute.

32:41.317 --> 32:43.185
I don't like you going to a country

32:43.186 --> 32:44.852
that's preparing for war.

32:45.954 --> 32:48.222
I know.

32:56.360 --> 32:56.965
WOMAN: <i>Okay.</i>

32:56.966 --> 33:01.335
So for this next proof,
we have a non-isosceles...

33:08.577 --> 33:10.245
What the hell is this?

33:10.246 --> 33:11.346
MPD. Stand aside.

33:11.347 --> 33:12.714
Whoa, whoa. Diplomatic security...

33:12.715 --> 33:15.075
- Report of a kid with a gun!
- Where are you getting this?!

33:15.099 --> 33:16.218
(students gasp)

33:16.219 --> 33:17.486
- Jason McCord!
- GIRL: Oh, my God!

33:17.487 --> 33:18.687
- Hands!
- (students clamoring)

33:18.688 --> 33:19.822
Hands! Show me your hands!

33:19.823 --> 33:21.289
Hey! Hey! Hey!

33:21.290 --> 33:23.824
(clamoring, screaming continues)

33:25.760 --> 33:27.295
Hey! (shouts)

33:27.296 --> 33:28.996
Okay, okay! Fine! Wait!

33:33.132 --> 33:35.400
(tires screech)

33:38.164 --> 33:39.566
Did you talk to him?

33:39.567 --> 33:41.134
No, but I spoke with Metro police.

33:41.135 --> 33:42.368
He's fine. Nobody got hurt.

33:42.369 --> 33:43.403
Oh, thank God.

33:43.404 --> 33:45.205
I thought you were
on your way to Algiers.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.086
Well, I-I was on the
tarmac when I got the call.

33:47.087 --> 33:48.727
But I turned it around.
Where is he, Todd?

33:48.751 --> 33:50.552
Madam Secretary,
Alex is with him inside.

33:50.553 --> 33:52.212
How the hell did this happen?

33:52.213 --> 33:55.982
FBI is into it, Dr. McCord,
but it looks like a prank.

33:55.983 --> 33:58.084
Metro police received an urgent call

33:58.085 --> 34:00.553
from the school's main
office that Jason had a gun

34:00.554 --> 34:02.622
and was threatening to
shoot up his classroom.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.857
It looks like the school's
phone system was hacked.

34:06.893 --> 34:08.862
- Oh, Jason.
- Mom.

34:08.862 --> 34:10.897
I'm so sorry. Okay, okay.

34:10.898 --> 34:12.818
- At least they didn't shoot me, huh?
- Hey, pal.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.067
- Oh, God.
- It was just a...

34:14.068 --> 34:16.569
- sick, disgusting prank.
- That must have been terrifying.

34:16.570 --> 34:17.971
- You okay?
- So, what?

34:17.972 --> 34:19.606
Does this have anything to do

34:19.607 --> 34:21.241
with why I have security guys now?

34:21.242 --> 34:22.542
Possibly. We don't know.

34:22.543 --> 34:23.983
We're gonna get to the bottom of it.

34:24.007 --> 34:25.245
Yeah, soon.

34:25.246 --> 34:26.946
You sound really confident.

34:26.947 --> 34:28.685
Okay, come on. Get your stuff.

34:28.686 --> 34:29.886
I'll take him home.
You don't worry about

34:29.887 --> 34:31.206
a thing when you're on your trip.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.248
Well, that won't be a problem,
'cause I'm not going.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.091
Babe, we're fine.

34:34.092 --> 34:35.492
Where are you supposed to be going?

34:35.516 --> 34:39.174
Algeria, but somebody else
can go in my place.

34:41.130 --> 34:44.433
(chuckles) Okay, this is so
much worse than I thought.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.168
HENRY: <i>You're scaring him.</i>

34:46.170 --> 34:47.971
ELIZABETH: Well, maybe
he should be scared.

34:47.972 --> 34:49.692
HENRY: Seriously, I will
lock the whole gang

34:49.693 --> 34:51.858
- in the house till you get back.
- I don't understand. An hour ago,

34:51.859 --> 34:53.710
you were trying to
convince me not to go.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.212
I still don't want you to go,

34:55.213 --> 34:57.147
but I trust that you need to.

34:57.148 --> 34:58.815
Don't aphorize me.

34:58.816 --> 35:01.951
I got this. Go stop a war.

35:02.619 --> 35:05.388
ELIZABETH: Hey, Matt.

35:05.389 --> 35:07.090
Uh, change of plans.

35:07.091 --> 35:08.992
Instead of going to the
Presidential Palace,

35:08.993 --> 35:12.162
I want to visit the
Ministry of Defense.

35:12.163 --> 35:14.531
I'll clear it through Algerian DGSP.

35:14.532 --> 35:16.266
Actually, no.

35:16.267 --> 35:18.735
I want to keep the circle tight.

35:18.736 --> 35:21.738
Just you and me and anyone else
you need to alert on our team.

35:21.739 --> 35:23.173
- Okay?
- Ma'am,

35:23.174 --> 35:25.776
I can't guarantee that local security

35:25.777 --> 35:27.711
and surveillance won't stop us.

35:27.712 --> 35:29.446
Understood.

35:29.447 --> 35:32.015
But it's important.

35:32.016 --> 35:33.784
Yes, ma'am.

35:33.785 --> 35:36.085
(gate creaks)

35:40.857 --> 35:43.827
Secretary McCord, you are
keeping the president waiting.

35:43.828 --> 35:46.563
I-I didn't come to see
President Haddad.

35:46.564 --> 35:48.297
I came for you.

35:49.566 --> 35:52.035
We have nothing to discuss.

35:52.036 --> 35:55.438
W-Why did you engage
with the U.S. military

35:55.439 --> 35:58.708
in saving St. Gabriel's Monastery?

35:58.709 --> 36:01.378
Whatever I did to try
to save the monastery,

36:01.379 --> 36:03.880
it was a failure.

36:03.881 --> 36:08.018
Hizb Al-Shahid militants
destroyed it this morning.

36:08.019 --> 36:09.586
(sighs)

36:09.587 --> 36:12.054
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:14.124 --> 36:17.327
But the fact that you tried to save it

36:17.328 --> 36:19.963
tells me that you cherish your country.

36:19.964 --> 36:22.532
And I just recently learned

36:22.533 --> 36:25.035
that when you took
leadership of the military,

36:25.036 --> 36:29.339
you enacted reforms to prevent
abuses against the public,

36:29.340 --> 36:32.776
which tells me that you care
about the Algerian people.

36:32.777 --> 36:36.378
Certainly more than
your president does.

36:40.417 --> 36:42.953
What do you want?

36:42.954 --> 36:46.790
In less than an hour,
U.S. and French fighter jets

36:46.791 --> 36:48.925
will decimate your tank columns.

36:48.926 --> 36:51.328
Then the insurgency
will march on Algiers,

36:51.329 --> 36:55.298
and it's anybody's bet whether
you or Haddad will survive.

36:55.299 --> 36:56.733
But there is one guarantee.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.902
It'll be a long, drawn-out conflict

36:58.903 --> 37:00.670
that will rip your country to shreds.

37:00.671 --> 37:03.740
Our forces are stronger than you think.

37:03.741 --> 37:06.041
No. Listen to me.

37:07.711 --> 37:10.747
I convinced the insurgency
to accept a truce

37:10.748 --> 37:13.316
with you as the interim
leader, as long as you enact

37:13.317 --> 37:16.152
the reforms already agreed upon.

37:16.153 --> 37:18.387
What about Haddad?

37:20.190 --> 37:22.259
You'll transport him to The Hague,

37:22.260 --> 37:26.462
where he will be tried by the
International Criminal Court.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.101
This is treason.

37:31.102 --> 37:34.580
This is how you save your country.

37:34.581 --> 37:35.305
(gate creaks open)

HADDAD: Madam McCord!

37:38.276 --> 37:40.410
How dare you sneak

37:40.411 --> 37:42.379
around my country!

37:42.380 --> 37:44.147
What is this all about?

37:44.148 --> 37:48.317
I demand to know what is going on.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.502
Through the nave.

40:09.503 --> 40:11.871
There's a statue of Matthew
on the back wall,

but that's not the same
statue they showed before;

40:13.856 --> 40:15.074
- that's a fake.
- Come on.

40:15.075 --> 40:17.243
You can really tell that
this pixilated image

40:17.244 --> 40:20.046
of a 1,500-year-old statue is a fake?

40:20.047 --> 40:21.327
I don't have to. Check this out.

40:21.351 --> 40:25.084
This is the same shot after
the dust has cleared.

See that?

40:26.353 --> 40:28.254
- That's rebar.

40:28.255 --> 40:30.189
until 1,000 years after
the monastery was built.

40:30.190 --> 40:33.959
HS wants us to think they
destroyed the statues,

40:33.960 --> 40:35.227
but they didn't.

40:35.228 --> 40:38.297
Terrorist groups have a
history of looting museums

40:38.298 --> 40:40.178
and selling their treasures
on the black market.

40:40.179 --> 40:41.145
Makes for a substantial,

40:41.146 --> 40:43.502
albeit nefarious, revenue stream.

40:43.503 --> 40:45.838
And you think Hizb Al-Shahid
is getting into that business?

40:45.839 --> 40:46.839
I know they are.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.041
This is a back door.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.476
We can take them down from the inside.

40:52.945 --> 40:55.980
I think you just signed up for
Black Dog Station, Henry.

Hi, babe.

41:03.857 --> 41:05.524
War averted.

41:05.525 --> 41:06.991
Yeah.

41:08.094 --> 41:09.095
Yeah.

41:09.096 --> 41:10.696
Nicely done.

41:10.697 --> 41:12.698
Thank you.

41:12.699 --> 41:14.233

(whispers): how's Jason holding up?

41:16.770 --> 41:19.238
He's playing a lot of Xbox.

41:19.239 --> 41:20.940
(laughs)

41:20.941 --> 41:22.575
Great.

41:22.576 --> 41:25.443
Family coping tradition is born.

41:26.479 --> 41:27.480
Yeah.

41:27.481 --> 41:29.281
(sighs)

41:29.282 --> 41:32.218
We need to talk.

41:32.219 --> 41:34.586
Yeah, I'm getting that.

41:36.489 --> 41:38.157
Director Doherty came by

41:38.158 --> 41:39.959
to catch us up on the investigation.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.594
As we suspected,

41:41.595 --> 41:44.029
the spoofed 911 call
from the school office

41:44.030 --> 41:45.498
was completely untraceable.

41:45.499 --> 41:49.767
Okay, get to the "need to talk" part.

41:52.771 --> 41:55.908
Agents found a note in Jason's locker.

41:55.909 --> 41:57.775
Here's a copy of it.

42:00.746 --> 42:02.981
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

42:06.051 --> 42:08.154
What about the-the
school security cameras?

42:08.155 --> 42:09.755
They were hacked.

42:09.756 --> 42:12.390
Turned off an hour
before the SWAT call.

42:15.594 --> 42:18.130
What... what the hell is going on?

42:18.131 --> 42:20.299
Is, uh, is this about my job?

42:20.300 --> 42:23.201
Why are they focusing
on the kids? Wh...

42:24.837 --> 42:26.739
What do they want from us, Henry?

42:26.740 --> 42:29.074
I'm racking my brain.

42:29.075 --> 42:30.676
What are we gonna do? I...

42:30.677 --> 42:32.744
I don't know.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.614
Jason is right.

42:35.615 --> 42:37.983
We've got to tell the kids.

42:37.984 --> 42:39.817
All of it.

42:41.554 --> 42:43.421
Oh, my God.
