00:02.934 --> 00:08.132
Lilly, why do you read that
tabloid trash? They're nothing but lies.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.803
-''Hannah Montana looks fabulous.''
-With the occasional glimmer of truth.

00:12.294 --> 00:14.330
You didn't let me finish.

00:14.454 --> 00:17.332
''Too bad she's really a guy.''

00:17.374 --> 00:21.083
-You've got to be kidding.
-l can't believe you didn't tell me.

00:21.134 --> 00:25.491
You slept over at my house.
You borrowed my bras.

00:25.534 --> 00:32.052
Hey, l look good in the moustache.
Oh, yeah, l would definitely date me.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.487
Me, too.

00:36.534 --> 00:39.002
-Awkward.
-Awkward.

00:40.294 --> 00:43.684
-Oh, oh!
-Let me guess.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.294
lt's another article about Jake Ryan,
isn't it?

00:46.454 --> 00:50.083
lt says his movie is done
and he's back in town for the premiere.

00:50.254 --> 00:52.051
Big whoop!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.846
l don't need some guy who kisses me

00:53.894 --> 00:57.409
knowing he's about to leave for
six months to do some stupid movie.

00:57.454 --> 00:59.445
Jake could fall out of the sky
wearing a tuxedo

00:59.494 --> 01:01.803
and l wouldn't care.

01:03.774 --> 01:06.971
-Miley?
-l'm serious.

01:07.014 --> 01:09.926
He could come down,
giving me a dozen roses,

01:09.974 --> 01:14.843
and it would make no difference.
Zero. Zilch. El zippo.

01:15.014 --> 01:19.724
What if he got down on his knees
and begged you to take him back?

01:19.774 --> 01:22.163
Like that's ever gonna happen.

01:24.374 --> 01:29.050
Sorry, it's only one rose.
But l did bring chocolates.

01:31.574 --> 01:34.771
Not just chocolates,
chocolates from the sky.

01:37.094 --> 01:40.564
Jake, l don't know what to say.

01:40.614 --> 01:43.845
So, l guess l'll just show you how l feel.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

Thanks.

02:59.734 --> 03:04.808
Gee, another basket from Jake.
What a surprise!

03:14.294 --> 03:15.522
l agree, Mile.

03:15.574 --> 03:18.884
Either date this boy Jake
or tell him to send a workout tape,

03:18.934 --> 03:22.643
because l'm about one muffin away
from my easy-fit jeans.

03:22.814 --> 03:27.092
l got two words for you, willpower.

03:27.934 --> 03:31.847
l got two words for you, mini jellies.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.687
l'm so weak.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.364
Look who was waiting in the driveway.

03:44.814 --> 03:46.884
You can almost hear him say,

03:46.934 --> 03:50.449
''Miley, take me back.
Give me one more chance.''

03:51.694 --> 03:54.049
Oh, l'll give you something.

03:54.094 --> 03:58.167
Not the chocolate chip ones.
Use the bran, nobody eats those.

03:59.414 --> 04:02.486
Oh, my dad does.
He calls them ''nature's broom.''

04:03.654 --> 04:05.963
Peanut butter balls.

04:06.054 --> 04:09.046
Hello, guys, this jerk hurt me

04:09.094 --> 04:11.972
and he's not gonna win me back
with peanut butter balls.

04:12.014 --> 04:15.131
Okay, you're right, darling.
l'm getting rid of everything.

04:16.853 --> 04:21.689
And l'll start by grilling up these
perfectly marbled T-bones.

04:22.214 --> 04:25.411
-Medium rare, please.
-Got it.

04:25.734 --> 04:29.204
Come on, Miley, the poor guy has done
just about everything a girl could want.

04:29.254 --> 04:31.927
What more could he do?

04:36.934 --> 04:39.448
Yeah, Miley, what else can l do?

04:46.214 --> 04:50.332
You're never gonna stop, are you?

04:50.614 --> 04:54.527
Miley, you've dumped stuff on me
and you've yelled at me.

04:54.574 --> 04:57.293
The one thing you haven't done
is tell me that you don't care about me.

04:57.494 --> 05:01.123
-Tell me that, and l'll go away.
-No, you can't.

05:02.454 --> 05:06.970
He's so... And you're...
l mean, come on.

05:08.774 --> 05:12.084
l know l kissed you and then left,
and l'm sorry.

05:12.134 --> 05:14.011
But l never stopped thinking about you.

05:14.054 --> 05:19.003
Oh, he never stopped,
and now, l mean, come on.

05:21.174 --> 05:23.404
-l'll just go help with the steaks.
-You do that.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.684
Come on, Jakers.

05:27.254 --> 05:31.247
Okay, l never stopped thinking
about you, either.

05:31.374 --> 05:35.049
-Then you'll give me another chance?
-How about we start with tonight?

05:39.854 --> 05:42.846
Slight problem.
Tonight's my movie premiere.

05:42.894 --> 05:46.204
Oh, that's okay. l mean, it's a little more
public than l wanted. But...

05:46.254 --> 05:49.007
No, no, no. See, the thing is...

05:49.054 --> 05:52.285
You already have a date, don't you?

05:52.334 --> 05:56.771
lt's not a real date, okay?
lt's with my co-star, okay?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.328
We just have to pretend
that we're dating for the press,

05:59.374 --> 06:01.569
you know, a kiss or two,
but it doesn't mean anything.

06:01.614 --> 06:04.128
Nothing you say ever means anything.

06:04.174 --> 06:05.926
You're the same jerk
you were six months ago,

06:05.974 --> 06:09.762
except now you're a jerk
with a headache.

06:09.814 --> 06:12.453
l don't have a...

06:12.494 --> 06:14.689
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

06:23.254 --> 06:25.609
l'm so hot.

06:25.654 --> 06:28.532
Yes, you are.

06:29.214 --> 06:33.492
-Could l get a bottle of water?
-Yes, you are.

06:35.134 --> 06:38.604
Can. l mean, yes, you can.

06:41.294 --> 06:44.650
Oh, sorry, Rico just tripled his price
to three bucks.

06:44.694 --> 06:46.924
But that's all l have,
and as l said before,

06:46.974 --> 06:50.284
l'm so, so hot.

06:50.374 --> 06:52.330
Don't go anywhere.

06:58.454 --> 07:01.810
Okay, l've taken care of me.

07:01.934 --> 07:05.893
Now, you.
You can have the employee discount.

07:11.934 --> 07:14.448
-You're fired.
-What are you talking about?

07:14.494 --> 07:17.770
Nice work, Natasha.
Go buy yourself something pretty.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.688
No, no, wait. Come back.

07:20.734 --> 07:23.726
l'm willing to look past this
and start anew.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.810
You ripped me off.

07:25.854 --> 07:28.652
Me? You're the one ripping people off.

07:28.694 --> 07:32.243
Three bucks for a bottle of water?
That's stealing.

07:32.294 --> 07:34.728
That's America.

07:35.134 --> 07:38.046
You want to give stuff away?
Open your own shack.

07:38.094 --> 07:42.645
You can call it lHOF.
lnternational House of Failure.

07:42.734 --> 07:46.613
Oh, well, maybe l will.
But instead l'll call it

07:46.654 --> 07:50.090
lnternational House
of Reasonably-Priced Water,

07:50.134 --> 07:54.889
and Fries and Stuff. lHORPWAFAS.

07:55.334 --> 07:58.883
Yeah, hear the name
and tremble, Rico.

07:58.934 --> 08:01.402
lHORPWAFAS.

08:05.414 --> 08:07.689
l'm Brian Winters,
and the stars are all out

08:07.734 --> 08:11.363
for the premiere of <i>Teen Gladiators</i>
<i>and the Sword of Fire.</i>

08:11.894 --> 08:15.364
And here are the Teen Gladiators,
Jake Ryan and Marissa Hughes

08:15.414 --> 08:19.043
coming over to talk to me,
Brian Winters.

08:19.094 --> 08:21.164
So, Jake, l don't know what's bigger,

08:21.214 --> 08:23.933
the buzz about this movie,
or the buzz about you two.

08:23.974 --> 08:28.126
<i>Oh, well, thanks, Brian. We're both</i>
<i>really excited about this movie.</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:31.484
-<i>Aren't we, honey?</i>
-<i>We sure are, Jakey.</i>

08:31.654 --> 08:34.373
We sure are, Jakey.

08:34.414 --> 08:38.566
Look at her.
Draped over him like drapes.

08:40.534 --> 08:46.245
Cheap, clingy drapes. lt's disgusting.

08:46.374 --> 08:48.604
Sure is.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.804
How can you guys
keep eating that stuff?

08:50.854 --> 08:54.813
That's Jake's steak,
the stake he drove through my heart.

08:55.014 --> 08:57.847
The good news is, it cuts like butter.

08:58.614 --> 09:00.047
Dad?

09:00.214 --> 09:03.524
l'm sorry, darling,
but you're better off without him.

09:03.574 --> 09:07.328
lf he's gonna choose her over you,
he obviously has no taste.

09:07.374 --> 09:11.492
Except in meat. This filet is fantastic.

09:16.214 --> 09:19.968
Look at him. All kissy with Marissy.

09:20.014 --> 09:22.767
''lt's only pretend.
lt doesn't mean anything.''

09:22.814 --> 09:27.046
Yeah, right, l was on your Tv show,
bub. You're not that good an actor.

09:28.174 --> 09:31.962
So, Jake, tell me, when did you
first know you were in love?

09:32.014 --> 09:33.447
Well, l know it sounds hokey,

09:33.494 --> 09:35.883
but the minute l looked into
Miley's eyes...

09:35.934 --> 09:41.247
-Miley?
-Oh, sorry. l meant Marissa.

09:50.094 --> 09:51.846
What?

09:52.654 --> 09:54.963
Did he just say...

09:59.054 --> 10:02.410
Girls hate the name flub.
Trust me, been there done that.

10:02.454 --> 10:05.844
But we all make mistakes, right, Jake?

10:06.334 --> 10:10.566
Yeah, and l'm in the middle
of a big one right now.

10:10.814 --> 10:13.612
Marissa's a good friend.

10:13.654 --> 10:18.648
The truth is, l'm in love with
a girl named Miley Stewart.

10:23.614 --> 10:27.527
But l blew it. That's the difference
between movies and real life.

10:27.574 --> 10:31.487
ln real life, you don't always
get a happy ending.

10:33.974 --> 10:36.010
<i>l'm in love with</i>
<i>a girl named Miley Stewart.</i>

10:38.214 --> 10:40.284
<i>l'm in love with</i>
<i>a girl named Miley Stewart.</i>

10:42.574 --> 10:44.087
<i>l'm in love with</i>
<i>a girl named Miley Stewart.</i>

10:44.254 --> 10:47.644
Mile, you're gonna break it.

10:47.694 --> 10:50.527
l don't care.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.048
Hey, Gladiator.

11:02.534 --> 11:03.887
Miley?

11:08.174 --> 11:10.734
Who says real life
doesn't have happy endings?

11:23.894 --> 11:25.612
This is so cool.

11:25.654 --> 11:28.885
l'm used to Hannah being famous,
but now Miley is, too.

11:28.934 --> 11:31.528
Your life is totally gonna change.

11:32.494 --> 11:36.646
lt is not. Other than having
the best boyfriend ever,

11:36.694 --> 11:40.050
my Miley life is gonna stay
exactly the same.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.931
Hi. Hi.

11:43.814 --> 11:46.009
Ashley, are you lost?

11:47.254 --> 11:51.930
You are so funny.
l've always loved that about you.

11:52.374 --> 11:54.524
Mean girl say what?

11:56.934 --> 11:59.926
Stop it. You are a delight.

12:00.134 --> 12:03.012
We're gonna be such great friends.

12:03.414 --> 12:07.089
Lilly, l love what you've done
with your hair.

12:07.134 --> 12:09.329
l'm wearing a hat.

12:09.574 --> 12:13.931
Hi. Hi. What are you doing here?
You said you were going to the mall.

12:13.974 --> 12:15.566
And you said
you were getting a manicure.

12:15.614 --> 12:18.208
Yeah, l am, with my new BFF.

12:18.254 --> 12:21.405
You mean, my new BFF.

12:29.254 --> 12:31.529
All your beach needs
at reasonable prices.

12:32.654 --> 12:35.248
l got Mylar balloons,

12:35.294 --> 12:37.250
and day-old bran muffins.

12:38.094 --> 12:41.291
Oh, come on, everybody.
They're ''nature's broom.''

12:42.334 --> 12:43.813
Hey, Jackson. How is it going?

12:43.854 --> 12:48.132
Dude, l don't get it. Rico rips people
off, and he still gets all the business.

12:48.174 --> 12:51.644
Well, maybe because at Rico's
you get over-priced hotdogs, right?

12:51.694 --> 12:55.050
And here you get
half-priced food poisoning.

12:55.374 --> 12:59.731
l mean, seriously, Jackson,
this relish stinks.

12:59.774 --> 13:03.084
-That's mayonnaise.
-Okay.

13:03.134 --> 13:06.683
Okay, so, maybe the shack
doesn't have ''refrigeration,''

13:06.734 --> 13:09.123
and the food isn't always ''edible,''

13:09.174 --> 13:11.893
and maybe we do have a little bit of
a ''bug problem.''

13:12.414 --> 13:17.010
But the shack's got character,
and like me, it's here to stay.

13:20.294 --> 13:21.443
l can fix this.

13:21.494 --> 13:26.249
Yeah, you got nacho cheese
all over my mom's homemade jerky.

13:26.294 --> 13:29.366
How will l live with the guilt?

13:29.414 --> 13:32.451
l was supposed to take this
to the precinct for the other cops,

13:32.494 --> 13:35.213
but now you've got the meat
with the cheese, it's not kosher.

13:35.254 --> 13:39.532
Oh, Detective Schwartz is gonna
go all <i>meshuggeneh.</i>

13:41.134 --> 13:43.204
Dude, l don't wanna tell you
how to run your shack,

13:43.254 --> 13:47.770
but this only works for like
really short people.

13:47.814 --> 13:50.408
-Not now, Todd.
-Hey, what's this?

13:50.454 --> 13:54.367
Well, it was
my mom's homemade jerky.

13:54.414 --> 13:56.132
Covered in cheese?

14:00.534 --> 14:02.092
How is it?

14:14.974 --> 14:16.202
<i>l'm the man who had the cheese</i>

14:16.254 --> 14:17.687
<i>l'm the man who had the jerky</i>

14:17.734 --> 14:18.769
<i>We put 'em both together</i>

14:18.814 --> 14:20.213
<i>And dude, it really worky</i>

14:20.254 --> 14:21.573
-<i>cheese jerky!</i>
-<i>cheese jerky!</i>

14:21.614 --> 14:22.808
-<i>Say what?</i>
-<i>Say what?</i>

14:22.854 --> 14:24.048
-<i>cheese jerky!</i>
-<i>cheese jerky!</i>

14:24.094 --> 14:25.607
-<i>Say what?</i>
-<i>Say what?</i>

14:25.654 --> 14:28.122
<i>Mozzarella moose</i>
<i>Swiss ham and Gouda turkey!</i>

14:28.174 --> 14:30.529
<i>Just one taste, it'll drive you berzerky!</i>

14:30.574 --> 14:31.768
<i>cheese jerky!</i>

14:31.814 --> 14:33.088
-<i>Say what?</i>
-<i>Say what?</i>

14:33.134 --> 14:35.648
<i>And it's all freaky, freaky, freaky, fresh!</i>

14:35.694 --> 14:38.606
Sizzling Stewart with Smokin' Oken
Enterprises, patent pending.

14:41.534 --> 14:42.728
Cheese jerky?

14:42.774 --> 14:44.446
That's the dumbest thing
l've ever heard.

14:44.494 --> 14:46.644
Maybe, but it's delicious.

14:47.934 --> 14:49.811
Just try it.

14:53.934 --> 14:58.325
-You don't like it?
-lt's delicious, and it's not mine.

14:59.614 --> 15:00.842
Yet.

15:06.854 --> 15:09.687
You see those sparkly stars in a line?

15:09.734 --> 15:11.611
That's Orion's Belt.

15:11.694 --> 15:14.083
And that star just to the right
of the belt,

15:14.134 --> 15:17.410
that's my new favourite.
lt's named Miley.

15:17.454 --> 15:22.369
-Shut up. lt is not.
-lt is now.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.331
Here's your certificate to prove it.

15:26.374 --> 15:28.490
You named a star after me?

15:28.534 --> 15:31.287
lt was either that or a half a mile
of lnterstate <i>5</i>.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.410
Miley, l've never felt so close
to anyone before,

15:37.454 --> 15:39.445
and l don't want there to be any secrets
between us,

15:39.494 --> 15:43.612
so l'm gonna tell you something
that l've never told anyone before.

15:44.814 --> 15:48.727
Please don't have a hairy back.
Please don't have a hairy back.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.484
My real name is Leslie.

15:58.134 --> 16:02.127
Leslie, right. That's good.
Seriously, what's the secret?

16:03.454 --> 16:05.206
That is the secret.

16:07.094 --> 16:09.562
And l love that name.

16:09.614 --> 16:13.323
l had a hamster named Leslie once,
until l figured out it was a boy.

16:15.374 --> 16:17.171
Go ahead. Make fun.

16:17.214 --> 16:22.572
No, no, l'm sorry. l'm actually touched
that you trust me so much.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.333
l do, and l can't tell you
how great it feels

16:25.374 --> 16:27.126
that l don't have to hide part of my life
from you,

16:27.174 --> 16:30.689
because l know
that you'd never do that to me.

16:31.214 --> 16:34.729
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

16:35.414 --> 16:37.644
Now we know everything
about each other.

16:37.734 --> 16:40.851
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

16:40.894 --> 16:43.408
There are no secrets between us.

16:43.454 --> 16:46.173
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

16:47.814 --> 16:50.487
That star didn't set you back too much,
did it?

16:55.534 --> 16:58.890
-Well...
-So...

17:05.334 --> 17:07.165
Dad?

17:07.214 --> 17:11.445
Don't you think the light would be
much better in the house?

17:11.694 --> 17:13.605
Oh, don't worry about me, darling.

17:13.654 --> 17:17.442
l can see everything
l need to see, right here.

17:19.773 --> 17:22.891
All right.
l'm gonna read <i>Family circus</i> now,

17:22.934 --> 17:25.653
so it should take about two seconds.

17:25.814 --> 17:28.328
Ready?

17:28.574 --> 17:31.213
One. Two. Good night, Jake.

17:33.254 --> 17:35.688
Good night, sir.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.853
Oh, honey, don't be mad at me.
l gave you two seconds.

17:43.894 --> 17:47.728
lt's not my fault the boy's got slow lips.

17:48.334 --> 17:54.091
lt's not that. Daddy, tonight Jake
was totally honest with me,

17:54.134 --> 17:58.571
and because of the Hannah secret,
l couldn't be the same with him.

17:58.774 --> 18:01.686
And when he asked me out
for tomorrow night,

18:01.734 --> 18:03.087
l had to lie to him again,

18:03.134 --> 18:06.331
because Hannah is reading to
that second grade class tomorrow.

18:06.374 --> 18:07.773
What kind of relationship will it be

18:07.814 --> 18:10.851
if l have to lie to him
about half of my life?

18:12.134 --> 18:15.012
Well, you could always tell him
the truth.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.726
What?

18:16.774 --> 18:18.844
Or not.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.529
Honey, l know it's a tough decision,
but l'm sure you'll make the right one.

18:22.574 --> 18:23.973
No, l won't.

18:24.014 --> 18:26.733
l'm 1 4.
l'm almost guaranteed to mess this up.

18:26.774 --> 18:30.164
You're the adult.
You're supposed to tell me what to do.

18:30.694 --> 18:34.846
What kind of a father would l be if
l just ordered you around all the time?

18:34.894 --> 18:37.249
A normal one.

18:37.374 --> 18:39.763
l swear, you are no help at all.

18:42.174 --> 18:46.008
What? Even when l don't say
something, l say something wrong.

18:47.614 --> 18:49.525
Well, at least they're off the porch.

18:55.734 --> 19:02.003
''And so all the animals
on Honest lsland were saved.

19:02.054 --> 19:08.368
''All because Trudy, the truthful turtle,

19:08.414 --> 19:14.853
''promised she would
never tell another lie.''

19:14.894 --> 19:17.328
Thank you, Hannah. Class?

19:17.374 --> 19:21.287
Thank you, Hannah Montana.

19:21.414 --> 19:24.212
Does anyone have questions
about honesty for Miss Montana?

19:24.254 --> 19:27.087
Or we could read another book.

19:27.134 --> 19:31.924
How about <i>Frankie, the Fibbing Frog?</i>

19:31.974 --> 19:33.373
Sweet niblets.

19:35.054 --> 19:38.444
-Samantha.
-Hannah, have you ever lied?

19:39.094 --> 19:42.325
Good question. Any more questions?

19:44.254 --> 19:45.323
Yes, sweetie.

19:45.374 --> 19:48.093
Why won't you answer
Samantha's question?

19:48.294 --> 19:53.049
Listen, sometimes life
gets complicated,

19:53.094 --> 19:58.487
and people get put into situations
that are complicated.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.893
Miss Montana, l'm sure

19:59.934 --> 20:02.494
you're not suggesting
to a class of second-graders

20:02.534 --> 20:06.447
-that lying is ever okay?
-No, no, no, of course not.

20:06.534 --> 20:11.050
lt's just that sometimes you have to.

20:12.734 --> 20:15.407
Hannah Montana's a liar.

20:17.254 --> 20:19.609
No, no, of course not. Listen, listen.

20:19.654 --> 20:21.884
lt's just that, you know, well...

20:21.934 --> 20:25.483
Superman doesn't tell Lois Lane
that he's Clark Kent,

20:25.534 --> 20:28.094
but it doesn't mean he doesn't love her.

20:28.134 --> 20:31.604
-Superman's a liar?
-What?

20:31.654 --> 20:33.610
No, no, no, never mind. He isn't real.

20:33.654 --> 20:37.647
-Superman isn't real?
-What?

20:37.734 --> 20:42.410
Okay, come on. Okay, how many
of your parents have told you

20:42.454 --> 20:44.843
that you're gonna be president
some day?

20:44.894 --> 20:49.251
Well, see? Think about it.
Not all of you can be president.

20:49.294 --> 20:52.730
Odds are none of you will be president.

20:56.854 --> 21:00.369
Well, it's just that... l was... l'm gonna...

21:01.774 --> 21:07.326
Who wants free CDs?
Free CDs, everyone.

21:14.614 --> 21:17.606
Hey, Miley, got your call. What's up?

21:18.294 --> 21:25.166
Jake, you were totally honest with me,
and l have a secret, too.

21:25.774 --> 21:28.004
And l'm not sure
how you're gonna take it.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.887
Oh, come on, how bad can it be?

21:30.934 --> 21:33.050
You're not married, are you?

21:33.774 --> 21:38.973
No, l'm not married,
and neither is Hannah Montana.

21:39.374 --> 21:41.251
What?

21:48.334 --> 21:50.165
l'm Hannah Montana.
