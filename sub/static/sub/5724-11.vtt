<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:08.714 --> 00:10.213
I want to build
a nightclub.

00:10.265 --> 00:12.382
Come on, man.
We can do this.

00:12.418 --> 00:14.634
The Lockhart brothers
back in business.

00:14.686 --> 00:16.553
I was just wondering
if you could tell me

00:16.605 --> 00:18.722
what the last day to drop
this class is.

00:18.724 --> 00:20.857
Tomorrow, actually,
the halfway mark.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.559
<i>If your plan is to go
to med school,</i>

00:22.611 --> 00:24.478
<i>I really encourage you
to continue.</i>

00:24.530 --> 00:26.363
<i>The longer you wait,
the harder it may be</i>

00:26.398 --> 00:27.397
<i>to jump back in.</i>

00:27.399 --> 00:28.765
What are you doing?

00:28.801 --> 00:31.067
I am sending an email
to my accountant

00:31.120 --> 00:33.770
and telling him to send you
$50,000.

00:33.806 --> 00:36.006
- Are you insane?
- It's not a loan.

00:36.041 --> 00:37.491
It's a gift, okay?

00:37.543 --> 00:39.075
No, I don't want to take
any more money off you.

00:39.128 --> 00:40.577
Well, the sooner you and Helen
get divorced,

00:40.629 --> 00:42.279
<i>the happier
everyone will be.</i>

00:42.314 --> 00:44.681
- The Lobster Roll.
- What about it?

00:44.716 --> 00:47.117
I want to buy it with you.

00:47.152 --> 00:49.219
I know you've got
your own cash,

00:49.254 --> 00:51.521
'cause I know what you
sold your house for, okay?

00:51.557 --> 00:53.089
Is this your daughter?

00:53.142 --> 00:54.891
- Yeah, uh, Gigi, I think...
- She's beautiful.

00:54.927 --> 00:56.426
Everybody says she
looks like Alison,

00:56.478 --> 00:58.261
but to me, she looks like
her daddy.

00:58.313 --> 01:01.465
You know what?
She does to me too.

02:27.853 --> 02:32.439
And did the defendant's
threat become physical?

02:32.491 --> 02:36.192
Noah threw my brother
on the ground.

02:36.245 --> 02:39.529
He started hitting him
over and over again.

02:39.581 --> 02:43.366
Then he... he started
choking Scotty.

02:43.368 --> 02:44.834
He couldn't breathe.

02:44.870 --> 02:47.037
If I didn't jump in,
I don't know...

02:47.039 --> 02:49.039
You feared for your
brother's life, didn't you?

02:49.091 --> 02:50.540
Yes.

02:50.542 --> 02:52.509
- Objection. Leading.
- Sustained.

02:52.544 --> 02:54.477
I'll refrain.

02:54.513 --> 02:58.148
Scott had impregnated
Mr. Solloway's teenage daughter.

02:58.183 --> 03:00.050
In that moment,
did you think that Mr. Solloway

03:00.085 --> 03:01.585
was capable
of killing your brother?

03:01.620 --> 03:02.586
Objection!

03:02.621 --> 03:05.622
Sustained.
Ms. Klass, please.

03:06.692 --> 03:08.124
No further questions.

03:12.698 --> 03:16.232
Mr. Lockhart,

03:16.285 --> 03:19.069
I only have
one question for you.

03:19.121 --> 03:21.321
Do you hate Noah Solloway?

03:21.373 --> 03:23.239
Excuse me?

03:25.127 --> 03:28.078
Would you mind telling
the jury

03:28.130 --> 03:31.331
what you feel when you look
at the defendant?

03:32.584 --> 03:36.186
I feel nothing.

03:36.221 --> 03:40.307
Noah Solloway had an affair
with your wife, did he not?

03:41.593 --> 03:43.093
With my ex-wife.

03:43.095 --> 03:45.595
And then to add insult
to injury,

03:45.597 --> 03:48.014
he destroyed
your family's reputation

03:48.066 --> 03:50.100
and their livelihood
in his novel.

03:50.152 --> 03:53.103
Is there no part of you
that hopes that this trial

03:53.155 --> 03:55.939
will serve as an opportunity
to punish him for that...

03:55.941 --> 03:57.607
Objection.

03:57.609 --> 03:59.526
...and not for
what he's actually accused of?

03:59.578 --> 04:01.277
Sustained.
Counselor...

04:05.283 --> 04:06.783
No further questions.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.716
_

04:27.339 --> 04:29.055
I'm nervous
about meeting your mom later.

04:29.107 --> 04:30.890
What if she doesn't like me?

04:30.942 --> 04:32.726
She probably won't.

04:34.646 --> 04:36.730
I'm her kid.
She can barely stand me.

04:36.782 --> 04:38.314
Well, give me some tips.

04:38.316 --> 04:41.901
How can I make
a good impression?

04:41.953 --> 04:43.653
All right, here's how
it's gonna go.

04:43.705 --> 04:45.321
You're gonna walk in.

04:45.374 --> 04:46.990
She's not gonna ask you
to take off your shoes,

04:47.042 --> 04:48.658
but you should take off
your shoes.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.827
Then she's gonna offer you
some lemonade.

04:50.879 --> 04:52.462
It's gonna taste like shit,

04:52.497 --> 04:53.963
'cause she never puts
enough sugar into it,

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
but try not to scrunch up
your face.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.001
And then she's gonna tell you
that we're cursed.

04:58.053 --> 05:00.136
So maybe don't mention
the fibroids.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.337
Right.

05:05.811 --> 05:08.178
- Fuck.
- Your boss?

05:08.230 --> 05:09.846
Yeah.

05:09.898 --> 05:11.147
Stephanie?

05:13.185 --> 05:15.485
Stephanie.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.187
I-I can't...

05:17.239 --> 05:18.488
Thank you.

05:18.523 --> 05:20.523
Hold on.
I-I can't hear you.

05:20.575 --> 05:22.859
You're breaking up.

05:22.911 --> 05:26.112
We're just pulling over.

05:26.164 --> 05:29.249
Okay, now, explain
to me the problem.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.619
Just have Lillian
bag the meat

05:32.671 --> 05:35.922
and put it into the alley
before it starts to smell.

05:38.877 --> 05:41.544
It's in...
it's in the basement.

05:46.384 --> 05:49.185
Yes, just go down there,
and it's right there.

05:49.221 --> 05:50.553
It's the first one.

06:47.329 --> 06:49.779
45 minutes and no calls
from Stephanie.

06:52.617 --> 06:55.618
Think that's got to be
some kind of record.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.621
Well, one day,
I'm gonna own my own restaurant

06:58.623 --> 07:01.674
so I don't have to deal
with anybody else's bullshit.

07:14.306 --> 07:16.689
What kind of place
would you want to open?

07:18.810 --> 07:21.277
Nothing fancy.

07:21.313 --> 07:23.980
Someplace
that means something

07:24.015 --> 07:25.982
to people that go there.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.160
I'm gonna take a bath.

07:49.241 --> 07:51.674
- Where you going?
- There's no soap.

07:51.676 --> 07:52.976
Hold on,
I'll get it for you.

07:53.011 --> 07:54.177
Relax.

07:57.182 --> 07:58.598
Excuse me?

07:58.650 --> 08:00.149
Uh,
we don't have soap here.

08:00.185 --> 08:01.551
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

08:01.586 --> 08:03.686
<i>I thought I restocked
that room.</i>

08:03.738 --> 08:06.022
Here you go.

08:06.074 --> 08:08.274
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:08.326 --> 08:10.777
Mom?

08:10.829 --> 08:12.445
Cole?

08:12.497 --> 08:14.447
Hello.

08:14.499 --> 08:17.033
You're Cherry?

08:17.035 --> 08:18.334
I'm so sorry.

08:18.370 --> 08:21.871
Mom, this is my fiancée,
Luisa.

08:21.923 --> 08:24.340
Very nice to meet you.

08:24.376 --> 08:27.543
Yeah, very nice
to meet you too.

08:27.596 --> 08:29.212
E'

08:29.214 --> 08:32.682
I didn't know that you were
working here.

08:32.717 --> 08:34.851
Well, I mean,
now you know.

08:39.724 --> 08:41.557
Does the room need
anything else?

08:41.610 --> 08:44.059
- No, the room's fine.
- Okay.

08:46.564 --> 08:49.315
- We'll see you later.
- Yes.

08:51.903 --> 08:54.037
Housekeeping.

08:56.908 --> 08:59.792
Housekeeping.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.255
I haven't looked
at these in years.

09:12.257 --> 09:15.925
This is on the day
that we were married.

09:15.961 --> 09:18.561
Oh, wow.

09:18.596 --> 09:20.063
You look so beautiful.

09:20.098 --> 09:21.764
Oh, thanks.

09:21.816 --> 09:23.433
Where did you
find all these?

09:23.435 --> 09:25.568
I found them when I was
cleaning out the breakfront

09:25.603 --> 09:28.271
right before I sold it.

09:28.323 --> 09:30.440
You sold Cora's breakfront?

09:30.492 --> 09:32.608
I didn't have a choice,
Cole.

09:38.283 --> 09:41.951
You look just like
your father, Cole.

09:42.003 --> 09:43.619
Yeah? You think?

09:43.672 --> 09:45.955
Yeah.

09:45.957 --> 09:48.691
People always tell me that,
but I don't see it.

09:51.513 --> 09:53.129
Now, that crusty old
son of a bitch

09:53.131 --> 09:54.597
is my grandfather Silas.

09:58.803 --> 10:01.437
Is, um, that the ranch
behind you?

10:01.473 --> 10:04.474
We were married
at the very top of that hill,

10:04.526 --> 10:07.410
October 2nd, 1974.

10:07.445 --> 10:09.445
I'm sorry that we didn't
manage to hang on to it

10:09.481 --> 10:12.315
a little while longer
for your sake, dear.

10:12.317 --> 10:14.117
What do you mean,
for my sake?

10:14.152 --> 10:17.987
Oh, so that you guys
could get married there too.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.656
But isn't that where
you and Alison got married?

10:20.692 --> 10:21.958
Mm-hmm.

10:21.993 --> 10:23.760
Then I'm glad it's gone.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.578
Excuse me?

10:25.630 --> 10:27.997
Well, I just... I just think
it's time for us

10:27.999 --> 10:30.333
to make our own traditions.

10:30.335 --> 10:31.918
We told Miranda we were
gonna meet her soon,

10:31.970 --> 10:33.970
so I think we should
get going, yeah?

10:39.677 --> 10:42.178
Oh.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.680
The prodigal son returns.

10:45.984 --> 10:48.484
Jesus Christ, Scott,
you look like shit.

10:50.572 --> 10:51.988
You don't.

10:52.023 --> 10:53.356
Your brother hasn't
been feeling very well...

10:53.408 --> 10:56.125
I feel great, Mom.

10:56.161 --> 10:59.162
Anyway, I was... I was just
heading out myself.

10:59.197 --> 11:00.279
I got a busy day ahead.

11:00.331 --> 11:01.364
Where you going, baby?

11:01.416 --> 11:03.032
I'm going to meet my investor.

11:03.068 --> 11:05.334
I don't know if you heard,
but the Lobster Roll

11:05.370 --> 11:06.869
is in foreclosure,
and I managed

11:06.921 --> 11:08.404
to save up a little
bit of money, so...

11:08.440 --> 11:10.840
You saved up some money?
How'd you do that?

11:10.875 --> 11:15.511
Well, I sold my truck,
sold my boat, um...

11:15.547 --> 11:16.679
Mom helped out.

11:16.714 --> 11:18.181
We sold off
most of the antiques.

11:18.216 --> 11:20.850
And, you know, I just got
to convince my guy

11:20.885 --> 11:22.485
that we are good to go,
and tomorrow,

11:22.520 --> 11:23.469
we take the plunge.

11:23.521 --> 11:25.054
So, hey, cheers to that.

11:25.106 --> 11:26.889
Ow! Fuck me!
God! God!

11:26.941 --> 11:28.691
- Are you all right?
- Jesus Christ, I'm fine.

11:28.726 --> 11:31.644
Okay? Thanks, Mom.
I'm just a little amped, okay?

11:31.696 --> 11:33.729
- Yeah, I can see that.
- I'll get some ice.

11:36.801 --> 11:38.534
Sorry about that.

11:38.570 --> 11:40.336
How much money do you have?

11:40.371 --> 11:43.206
I got about 37K, man.

11:43.241 --> 11:46.209
37K...

11:46.244 --> 11:48.044
What do you think that place
is gonna go for,

11:48.079 --> 11:49.078
a couple million?

11:49.130 --> 11:50.680
Yeah.

11:50.715 --> 11:52.331
So you have 37 grand,
and this investor's

11:52.383 --> 11:54.117
just gonna cover you
for the rest.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.919
Look, man, if you want in
on this, it's not too late.

11:56.921 --> 12:00.590
No, I want you to do something
good with that money.

12:00.625 --> 12:03.059
I think you need
to go to rehab, Scott.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.685
Get... get the fuck off me.

12:12.737 --> 12:16.772
You know what?
Just go fuck yourself, okay?

12:16.774 --> 12:18.858
Who knows, maybe we'll see you
in another couple years.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.943
We'll have a fucking good time.

12:32.340 --> 12:33.923
You gave him money?

12:33.958 --> 12:37.894
Cole, we haven't seen you
in a while.

12:37.929 --> 12:39.795
You don't get to just
walk on in here

12:39.848 --> 12:41.297
and tell everyone
what's wrong with them.

12:41.299 --> 12:42.882
That's not what I'm doing.

12:42.934 --> 12:45.034
I'm gonna freshen up,
and then we should go.

12:55.647 --> 12:58.314
Yes, we have got to go
with chocolate, right?

12:58.316 --> 13:00.066
- That we can agree on.
- Yes, absolutely, yes.

13:00.118 --> 13:01.817
Okay, good, 'cause otherwise
the wedding's off.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.236
The wedding's off?

13:03.288 --> 13:05.154
Please tell me he's joking.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.658
- Hello, lovely.
- Hi, Margaret.

13:08.660 --> 13:11.827
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.579
Margaret, um, this is Cole.

13:13.631 --> 13:15.414
Congratulations, Cole.
Nice to meet you.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.466
Thank you.
It's nice to meet you too.

13:17.502 --> 13:19.969
- <i>Adorable.</i>
- And the mother.

13:20.004 --> 13:22.088
- This is my mother, Cherry.
- Hello.

13:22.140 --> 13:24.340
It's a pleasure.
Margaret Butler.

13:24.342 --> 13:26.142
Please excuse my sweatiness.

13:26.177 --> 13:28.144
I've lost my mind
and started spinning.

13:29.347 --> 13:31.113
Come on, everybody,
sit down.

13:31.149 --> 13:35.017
Mi casa es su casa,
as Miranda would say.

13:35.019 --> 13:37.320
Well, have you picked
a weekend?

13:37.355 --> 13:40.489
I want to tell the landscaper
so he can put some plants out.

13:40.525 --> 13:41.991
Uh...

13:43.194 --> 13:44.944
Haven't you asked them?

13:44.996 --> 13:47.530
Asked them what?

13:51.586 --> 13:52.952
I'm sorry, what'd she say?

13:53.004 --> 13:54.503
I would love to have
the wedding here.

13:54.539 --> 13:56.372
I'll pay for everything.

13:56.374 --> 13:58.307
That's... I don't think...

13:58.343 --> 14:00.209
It's the least I can do.

14:00.261 --> 14:03.713
Your mother has taken care of
this house and us for 30 years,

14:03.715 --> 14:05.715
and now the place
is basically empty.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.550
I know, that's very generous,
but...

14:23.701 --> 14:25.868
I think there may have just
been a misunderstanding here.

14:25.903 --> 14:28.571
I'm sorry.
I don't want to upset anyone.

14:28.623 --> 14:30.039
It's just an offer,
sweetheart.

14:30.074 --> 14:31.657
- I know.
- You can take it or leave it.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.075
Right, and we really
appreciate it.

14:33.127 --> 14:34.410
Yes, we do.

14:34.462 --> 14:36.412
But this is a Lockhart-Leon
wedding,

14:36.414 --> 14:39.582
and we'd like to do it
ourselves.

14:39.634 --> 14:42.084
Did you say Lockhart?

14:42.136 --> 14:44.754
As in the Lockhart Ranch,
the brothers?

14:44.789 --> 14:46.889
That's right.

14:46.924 --> 14:49.959
I trust you're not the one who
impregnated my granddaughter.

14:49.994 --> 14:51.560
Oh, my God.

14:51.596 --> 14:54.463
- That's my brother, Scott.
- I see.

14:54.499 --> 14:58.734
So you must be the one who
pulled a gun on Noah Solloway.

14:59.937 --> 15:00.936
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

15:03.308 --> 15:04.940
Miranda, pleasure.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.776
We'll see you soon.
Hasta luego.

15:06.828 --> 15:08.194
You're leaving?

15:08.246 --> 15:09.779
It was wonderful to meet you.

15:09.781 --> 15:11.947
Hold on.

15:11.949 --> 15:15.618
I understand you might not want
to have the wedding here,

15:15.620 --> 15:17.953
but please know
that you're welcome to.

15:18.006 --> 15:21.040
That's very generous of you.
Thank you.

15:21.092 --> 15:25.044
I've come to a time in my life
when I understand that...

15:25.096 --> 15:29.265
...a little forgiveness
goes a long way.

15:33.204 --> 15:34.603
We could just elope.

15:34.639 --> 15:36.505
I don't want to elope.

15:36.541 --> 15:38.240
It could be nice,
a quick little road trip

15:38.276 --> 15:39.342
out to Vegas...

15:39.377 --> 15:41.177
Vegas? No!

15:41.212 --> 15:43.813
We could hitch the trailer up
to the back of my car.

15:43.848 --> 15:46.515
That's great.

15:46.551 --> 15:49.402
Any other ideas?

15:49.454 --> 15:52.822
I do have one other idea.

15:52.824 --> 15:54.490
What about the Lobster Roll?

15:54.542 --> 15:55.658
For our wedding?

15:55.710 --> 15:57.093
Yeah.

15:57.128 --> 15:58.327
Didn't you see it
this morning?

15:58.379 --> 16:00.296
It's, like, falling down.

16:00.331 --> 16:01.414
It's in foreclosure.

16:01.466 --> 16:03.833
What if we bought it?

16:03.885 --> 16:07.503
What if we fixed it up?

16:07.555 --> 16:10.256
Are you serious?

16:10.308 --> 16:12.925
Yeah, yeah, I think I am.

16:12.977 --> 16:15.177
I mean, look,
Scotty is in a very dark place,

16:15.229 --> 16:16.345
but he's right about this.

16:16.347 --> 16:18.013
It's a fucking great investment.

16:18.015 --> 16:19.348
You can't get
into or out of Montauk

16:19.400 --> 16:21.434
without driving
right past that place.

16:21.486 --> 16:23.519
- I know that, but...
- I mean, just think about it.

16:23.521 --> 16:25.988
New menu, new space,
keep what's always

16:26.023 --> 16:27.857
made that place great,
but make it your own,

16:27.909 --> 16:29.525
make it our own.

16:29.577 --> 16:32.161
- Cole...
- It's tempting, right?

16:32.196 --> 16:33.863
We have our own place.

16:33.915 --> 16:35.998
We can move back out here.
We can work for ourselves.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.367
No more crazy Stephanie.

16:38.419 --> 16:41.871
Yeah, but we'll have
crazy Scotty instead.

16:41.873 --> 16:46.709
Well, I don't think
we could do it with him.

16:46.711 --> 16:48.878
- No?
- No.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.348
Not in the condition
that he's in.

16:52.383 --> 16:53.849
And he's completely
full of shit.

16:53.885 --> 16:56.185
He has nowhere near
that kind of money.

16:56.220 --> 16:57.386
And we do?

17:00.558 --> 17:03.159
Well, yeah, kind of.

17:03.194 --> 17:05.227
What do you mean?

17:05.229 --> 17:07.396
My money from Alison's house.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.984
But I thought you didn't
want to touch that money.

17:13.037 --> 17:16.238
I don't,
but I would for this.

17:19.544 --> 17:21.827
Is it enough?

17:21.878 --> 17:26.832
Um, I think it's, like,
half enough.

17:26.884 --> 17:28.751
Cole, I don't want to get
a loan from the bank.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.085
I promised myself,
I didn't want to

17:30.121 --> 17:31.454
get in debt in this country.

17:31.489 --> 17:33.956
I don't want to get
a loan either.

17:33.991 --> 17:36.592
Okay,
so how's it gonna work?

17:36.627 --> 17:39.261
Do you know people
with lots of money?

17:40.965 --> 17:43.132
I thought
we could ask Alison.

17:45.436 --> 17:47.736
Look, I'm pretty sure she still
has her share of the money,

17:47.772 --> 17:50.606
and I bet that she'd be willing
to go in on this with us.

17:50.658 --> 17:52.708
To buy the restaurant?

17:52.743 --> 17:54.577
You, me, and your ex?

17:54.612 --> 17:57.530
Yes.

17:57.582 --> 17:59.281
Alison cheated on you, Cole.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.200
I know.

18:01.252 --> 18:02.785
Look, I'll admit I haven't
worked through

18:02.837 --> 18:04.787
all the details yet,
and I know that sounds crazy,

18:04.789 --> 18:06.755
but... but I mean...

18:09.427 --> 18:11.527
I'd rather go to Vegas.

18:15.683 --> 18:18.634
If what's holding you back
from this is the fear

18:18.686 --> 18:20.886
that it might lead to me
getting back together

18:20.938 --> 18:23.939
with my ex-wife,
who cheated on me,

18:23.975 --> 18:27.476
that's not ever going
to happen.

18:27.478 --> 18:31.146
You have my word.

18:31.148 --> 18:34.567
What if I say no?

18:34.619 --> 18:37.820
What do you mean?

18:37.822 --> 18:41.574
Is the wedding gonna be off?

18:41.626 --> 18:43.158
No.

18:44.996 --> 18:46.962
Of course not.

18:46.998 --> 18:50.916
If you say no,
that's the end of it.

18:50.968 --> 18:54.253
I will do whatever you want.

18:54.305 --> 18:55.921
We can get married
wherever you want,

18:55.973 --> 18:57.640
and we can live
wherever you want.

19:03.231 --> 19:05.180
This could be a dream
come true

19:05.233 --> 19:06.599
or the worst idea ever.

19:06.651 --> 19:08.350
I can't decide.

19:11.689 --> 19:14.490
<i>A 1.3 million.
I have 1.3 million.</i>

19:14.525 --> 19:17.526
<i>1.4 million, 1.4 million?
1.4 million is bid.</i>

19:17.528 --> 19:19.361
<i>Do I have 1.5 million?</i>

19:31.208 --> 19:33.042
Can I give you a ride
to the train station?

19:33.094 --> 19:36.045
Uh... no.

19:36.097 --> 19:38.047
I'm gonna go swing by
and take a look

19:38.099 --> 19:39.848
at our new...

19:41.552 --> 19:43.552
Holy fuck!

19:43.588 --> 19:45.638
You are my hero.

19:45.690 --> 19:46.889
What are you doing?

19:46.941 --> 19:49.358
And you, you motherfucker!

19:49.393 --> 19:50.726
God damn it!

19:50.778 --> 19:52.478
Oh, God, I was gonna
stay away.

19:52.530 --> 19:55.064
I was... especially after
my guy stood me up yesterday,

19:55.099 --> 19:56.565
I was definitely gonna
stay away,

19:56.617 --> 19:58.567
but I guess I'm a fucking
masochist, huh?

19:58.619 --> 20:01.904
So I just... I had to see
what Manhattan douche bag

20:01.906 --> 20:05.908
was gonna steal my dream,
and goddamn if it wasn't you.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.242
Oh, God!

20:07.295 --> 20:08.994
I was watching you
from the back.

20:09.046 --> 20:11.580
You were raising your hand
like a motherfucking baller.

20:11.582 --> 20:13.916
And, Jesus, man,
you came through.

20:13.968 --> 20:16.085
You always do.
You always come through.

20:16.087 --> 20:17.419
Are you feeling okay, Scotty?

20:17.421 --> 20:19.004
Oh, yeah, I'm fucking happy.

20:19.056 --> 20:20.506
I'm just happy.

20:20.558 --> 20:22.257
God, you're not gonna
regret this, okay?

20:22.259 --> 20:23.759
You are not gonna
regret this.

20:23.761 --> 20:25.761
- What's that?
- About 37 grand, give or take.

20:25.813 --> 20:27.346
Like, I don't know what the
percentages work out to, but...

20:27.398 --> 20:28.564
I don't want your money.

20:28.599 --> 20:30.349
I don't want it.

20:30.401 --> 20:31.934
What do you mean,
you don't want it?

20:31.936 --> 20:33.268
Here, take it, take it, please.

20:33.321 --> 20:35.104
- I don't want it.
- No, come on...

20:35.106 --> 20:37.606
I'm not going into business
with you like this, okay?

20:37.608 --> 20:40.109
I'm not looking for an even
split or anything.

20:40.111 --> 20:43.612
The answer's no!
Scott, the answer's no.

20:43.664 --> 20:45.948
No, uh-uh.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.249
Now wait a second, okay?

20:47.284 --> 20:50.119
'Cause this was my idea.

20:50.121 --> 20:53.539
I told you about this.
I told you <i>both</i> about this.

20:53.591 --> 20:55.624
Take that money and do
something useful with it, okay?

20:55.676 --> 20:56.959
You can't do this to me, Cole.

20:56.961 --> 20:59.795
You... you cannot do this to me.

20:59.797 --> 21:03.265
Everything I've wanted in my
life, <i>you</i> take away from me.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.968
Huh? First it was Luisa; now
it's the fucking Lobster Roll.

21:05.970 --> 21:08.270
This was my idea!
This was my shot!

21:08.305 --> 21:10.356
Scotty,
you're a fucking junkie!

21:13.477 --> 21:16.311
All right, I'm the junkie!
I'm the fuckup!

21:16.364 --> 21:19.281
I'm the loser.
But her, her...

21:19.316 --> 21:20.683
her, you trust?

21:20.718 --> 21:22.484
You are so fucking blind.

21:22.486 --> 21:24.319
You can't see what is right
in front of you!

21:24.321 --> 21:26.789
She's fucking pathological!

21:26.824 --> 21:29.658
God damn it, Cole,
I could tell you something

21:29.660 --> 21:32.211
that would blow up
your entire fucking life.

21:34.498 --> 21:36.498
- Couldn't I?
- Fuck you, Scott.

21:36.550 --> 21:39.301
Huh? Couldn't I?

21:39.336 --> 21:42.087
But what you're gonna do
is, you're fucking

21:42.139 --> 21:44.006
going to cut me in!

21:56.737 --> 22:00.222
Scott, hey, hey.

22:00.257 --> 22:02.357
I'm sorry.

22:02.359 --> 22:05.160
I'm sorry, Scotty.
I'm sorry.

22:05.196 --> 22:07.496
You all right?
Hey, bud, hey.

22:07.531 --> 22:09.248
It's gonna be okay, all right?

22:15.089 --> 22:17.539
Just take it, please.
Just fucking take it.

22:17.541 --> 22:20.209
All right.
Hey, hey, man.

22:22.847 --> 22:26.215
Scott, Scott,
I'll bring you in, okay?

22:26.267 --> 22:28.584
I will bring you in.
I promise.

22:30.688 --> 22:33.522
You just got to go someplace
that's gonna give you some help.

22:33.557 --> 22:35.557
Okay?
I will drive you there myself.

22:35.559 --> 22:37.476
Just please promise me
you will do that.

22:37.528 --> 22:39.228
You have got to clean up.

22:41.949 --> 22:45.400
If I go...

22:45.402 --> 22:48.737
If I go,
you... you bring me in?

22:49.740 --> 22:51.740
Yeah.

22:51.742 --> 22:54.576
I promise, okay?

22:56.080 --> 22:59.248
But you got to get cleaned up,
okay?

23:01.585 --> 23:04.720
No more of this.

23:14.431 --> 23:18.567
Hey, what were you
gonna tell me?

23:18.602 --> 23:20.102
What was it that you were
gonna tell me

23:20.154 --> 23:22.154
that could fuck up
my entire life?

23:41.242 --> 23:45.072
_

24:15.993 --> 24:17.459
Oh, God.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.076
- Knock knock.
- What time is it?

25:41.128 --> 25:43.211
It's time for me to shower.

25:45.749 --> 25:47.249
Who's awake?

25:47.251 --> 25:48.917
Uh, everybody.

25:48.919 --> 25:52.087
I put on some more coffee
for you.

25:52.089 --> 25:53.472
Thanks.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.735
Noah?

26:06.770 --> 26:07.936
Noah?

26:09.239 --> 26:10.939
Noah!

26:12.276 --> 26:14.743
I called you, like,
three times.

26:14.778 --> 26:17.112
Sorry, didn't hear.

26:18.949 --> 26:22.367
Look, uh, do you have
any time to talk this morning?

26:22.419 --> 26:25.921
Uh, well, not really.

26:25.956 --> 26:27.456
I really want to finish
this section

26:27.458 --> 26:29.374
before I see Harry today.

26:29.426 --> 26:31.293
Maybe when the kids
leave for school?

26:31.345 --> 26:32.961
I just need some time with you.

26:32.963 --> 26:34.963
How about tonight?
Let's have a date night.

26:34.965 --> 26:36.631
It'll be nice.

26:36.633 --> 26:39.301
<i>Dad, Joanie spilled my juice!</i>

26:39.303 --> 26:42.604
Okay, we'll do it tonight, yeah?

26:42.639 --> 26:44.473
<i>Ow! Dad!</i>

26:44.475 --> 26:46.475
<i>Dad, Stacey hit me!</i>

26:46.527 --> 26:49.561
Hey, it's your final today,
isn't it?

26:49.613 --> 26:50.979
Yeah.

26:53.984 --> 26:57.452
Don't be nervous.
You'll be great.

26:57.488 --> 26:58.453
<i>Dad!</i>

26:58.489 --> 27:00.489
Coming.

27:00.491 --> 27:04.326
So when do you think I might be
able to see some pages?

27:04.328 --> 27:05.494
I don't know, Harry.

27:05.496 --> 27:06.995
I've still got a ton
of research.

27:06.997 --> 27:08.630
Well, I would love
to get something

27:08.665 --> 27:10.265
in the stores by Christmas.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.967
Are you out of your mind?

27:12.002 --> 27:14.636
Oh, okay,
how about Valentine's Day?

27:14.671 --> 27:16.138
It's not that kind of book.

27:16.173 --> 27:18.473
But there is a certain
optimal window of time

27:18.509 --> 27:20.092
for follow-up, okay?

27:20.144 --> 27:22.177
If we get your second book
in the stores this year,

27:22.229 --> 27:25.847
that would be ideal.

27:25.849 --> 27:29.351
Are you sleeping at all?

27:29.353 --> 27:32.854
Let me just... let me tell you
a little about

27:32.856 --> 27:36.324
my schedule right now, okay?

27:36.360 --> 27:38.226
I've got 15 needy students

27:38.262 --> 27:40.529
whose finals have to be
evaluated by next week.

27:40.581 --> 27:42.697
My baby's still not
sleeping through the night.

27:42.699 --> 27:44.866
Alison is studying
for her MCATs.

27:44.868 --> 27:47.536
My other four children,
one of whom is still

27:47.588 --> 27:49.538
not speaking to me,
so I spend about an hour

27:49.590 --> 27:51.873
every day writing letters
of apology to her,

27:51.925 --> 27:53.625
which she never returns.

27:53.677 --> 27:56.128
I get up at 4:30 in the morning
to write on the toilet

27:56.180 --> 27:59.214
because Alison has turned my
office into a fucking nursery.

27:59.266 --> 28:01.316
Okay, okay, I hear you, man.

28:01.351 --> 28:04.319
You know, we need to get you
out of town.

28:04.354 --> 28:06.354
You know what, I got a friend
on the board of Yaddo.

28:06.390 --> 28:07.722
I will call her today.

28:07.775 --> 28:09.157
We can have you up there
by the end of this week.

28:09.193 --> 28:11.026
You can stay there
as long as you like.

28:11.061 --> 28:14.362
- As long as it takes.
- I can't go to Yaddo.

28:14.398 --> 28:16.231
What about Yvonne?

28:16.283 --> 28:18.316
I'm sure she would love
to have you back in Cold Spring.

28:18.368 --> 28:19.668
Didn't you hear anything
I just said

28:19.703 --> 28:21.770
about Alison and the kids?

28:21.805 --> 28:24.656
Surely, Helen can take the
older ones for a little while.

28:24.708 --> 28:26.908
Alison can handle Joanie.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.543
Why wouldn't that work?

28:28.579 --> 28:30.545
Because I can't.
I can't do that to her.

28:30.581 --> 28:31.880
These tests
are really important.

28:31.915 --> 28:33.248
If she doesn't ace them,

28:33.300 --> 28:34.332
she's not going
to school anywhere,

28:34.384 --> 28:35.333
least of all the city.

28:35.385 --> 28:37.052
Okay.

28:37.087 --> 28:39.588
I didn't realize that Alison
wanted to be a doctor.

28:39.590 --> 28:43.058
Yeah, it's her lifelong dream.

28:43.093 --> 28:45.794
That's surprising,
for some reason.

28:45.829 --> 28:48.730
Why?

28:48.765 --> 28:49.898
I don't know.

28:49.933 --> 28:51.433
I guess it shouldn't.

28:51.435 --> 28:53.235
Some people just write
slowly, Harry.

28:53.270 --> 28:54.736
Do you know how long it took
Charles Frasier

28:54.771 --> 28:55.937
to write <i>Cold Mountain?</i>

28:55.989 --> 28:58.356
- Ten years.
- Right, ten years.

28:58.408 --> 28:59.908
And that was a good book.

28:59.943 --> 29:01.693
Right, then took him
another ten years

29:01.745 --> 29:04.029
to write the second book.

29:04.081 --> 29:08.283
- He wrote another one?
- Exactly.

29:08.285 --> 29:10.785
People have a very short
memory, Noah,

29:10.838 --> 29:12.587
and I just want to keep you
relevant

29:12.623 --> 29:15.757
for a little while longer.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.592
You know what,
I got an idea.

29:17.628 --> 29:19.127
Since you don't have
as much time now

29:19.179 --> 29:21.046
as you would like,
why don't you

29:21.098 --> 29:24.049
put the Omar Bradley idea
aside for a little while

29:24.101 --> 29:27.135
and concentrate on something
less ambitious?

29:28.522 --> 29:29.804
Like what?

29:29.857 --> 29:32.390
Like <i>Ascent.</i>

29:32.442 --> 29:33.942
<i>Ascent?</i>

29:33.977 --> 29:36.228
- It's a sequel.
- No.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.014
I don't think people are done
with Daniel Tapper's journey.

29:39.049 --> 29:41.116
What happens to him
after he kills Lana?

29:41.151 --> 29:42.317
Is he punished for the crime?

29:42.369 --> 29:44.819
Does he get away with it?

29:44.821 --> 29:46.488
You wrote <i>Descent</i> in under
three months, right?

29:46.540 --> 29:48.456
So you knock another one out
in the series...

29:48.492 --> 29:49.908
Series?

29:49.960 --> 29:51.159
Yes, and we keep your name
on the best seller list,

29:51.211 --> 29:53.628
and we buy you some time
to write your opus

29:53.664 --> 29:55.163
when you're ready.

29:55.165 --> 29:57.165
What kind of writer
do you think I am, Harry?

29:57.167 --> 29:59.868
- An excellent one.
- Like Danielle Steel?

29:59.903 --> 30:03.805
How about John Le Carré?

30:03.840 --> 30:06.007
No, <i>Descent...</i>
it was an anomaly.

30:06.009 --> 30:08.143
I mean, it poured out of me
because it had to.

30:08.178 --> 30:11.813
But I'm not... I'm not
a pulp novelist.

30:11.848 --> 30:14.182
This is not
my first rodeo, Noah.

30:14.234 --> 30:17.319
I have seen writers do exactly
what you're doing, right?

30:17.354 --> 30:19.387
They write one
smashing success,

30:19.423 --> 30:21.022
and then they get scared
that they're gonna be

30:21.024 --> 30:23.358
ghettoized as populists,
so they take a decade

30:23.360 --> 30:24.943
to write the second book,
and by that time,

30:24.995 --> 30:29.464
nobody remembers
who they are or why we cared.

30:29.499 --> 30:32.067
Just consider
the possibility that maybe

30:32.102 --> 30:35.537
you wrote <i>Descent</i> so quickly
and so brilliantly

30:35.539 --> 30:38.873
because that actually
is the writer that you are.

30:38.875 --> 30:42.010
And this attempt to follow
Omar Bradley to Paris

30:42.045 --> 30:46.298
is perhaps your ego speaking...

30:46.350 --> 30:48.116
and not your heart.

30:50.053 --> 30:53.722
- How was everything?
- It was great.

30:53.724 --> 30:57.225
Can I get you two
anything else?

30:57.277 --> 30:58.727
No, I'm done.

31:10.073 --> 31:11.439
Excuse me.

31:11.475 --> 31:13.658
Are you coming out
of the biochemistry final?

31:13.710 --> 31:15.577
Yeah, man.
I got killed.

31:15.579 --> 31:18.496
Sorry to hear that.
Which classroom is it?

31:18.548 --> 31:19.914
That one,
through those doors.

31:19.967 --> 31:21.082
Thanks.

31:28.225 --> 31:29.591
Can I help you?

31:29.626 --> 31:31.092
Yeah, is this biochem?

31:31.128 --> 31:33.395
Was. Torture's over.

31:33.430 --> 31:35.297
I'm looking for Alison Bailey.

31:35.332 --> 31:36.564
She's a student.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.235
Yeah, I know Alison,
my runaway nurse.

31:40.270 --> 31:41.603
Runaway?

31:41.638 --> 31:44.906
Alison dropped
six, seven weeks ago,

31:44.941 --> 31:47.742
before the midterm.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.077
Sorry, that's impossible.

31:49.112 --> 31:52.614
She was headed to class
this morning.

31:52.666 --> 31:54.749
Fun starts again
in September.

31:54.785 --> 31:57.702
Tell her, uh,
she's welcome back.

31:57.754 --> 31:59.204
Have a good summer, man.

32:03.844 --> 32:05.210
Ali?

32:18.608 --> 32:19.974
Alison?

32:26.149 --> 32:28.566
- Hi, Dad!
- Hey.

32:28.618 --> 32:29.818
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey.

32:31.538 --> 32:33.071
Have you seen Alison?

32:33.123 --> 32:35.824
No, I was here alone
with Joanie this morning.

32:35.876 --> 32:37.742
Then I left to get the kids.

32:37.794 --> 32:39.327
Something wrong?

32:39.379 --> 32:41.880
- You heard from her?
- Nothing at all.

32:52.642 --> 32:54.759
What the fuck?

33:14.081 --> 33:16.331
Hey, man, don't kill
the messenger.

33:16.366 --> 33:18.166
Where is she?

33:18.201 --> 33:20.034
Right now, no idea.

33:22.672 --> 33:24.472
Where did you take
that picture?

33:24.508 --> 33:27.976
Town hall this morning.

33:28.011 --> 33:30.311
Auction for the Roll.

33:30.347 --> 33:33.381
- The... the...
- Yeah, the Lobster Roll.

33:33.417 --> 33:37.685
Which I lost today
to Cole and Alison.

33:37.721 --> 33:40.488
- What?
- Yeah.

33:40.524 --> 33:44.225
Funny, I had a feeling
she hadn't told you.

33:44.261 --> 33:45.927
I have a sixth sense
about that girl.

33:45.962 --> 33:47.862
I always have.

33:47.898 --> 33:51.599
You're telling me
that Cole and Alison...

33:51.635 --> 33:55.236
Placed a bid, bought the Roll
right out from fucking under me.

33:58.608 --> 34:02.544
Fucking hurricane puts me
at least 100 Gs in the hole.

34:02.579 --> 34:05.380
Then I had to get a second
mortgage to cover my...

34:08.135 --> 34:10.752
My father's heart surgery.

34:10.804 --> 34:12.920
But do they fucking care?

34:12.922 --> 34:15.639
No, of course not.
I mean, why should they?

34:17.928 --> 34:20.478
It's not like we've known
each other for 30 years.

34:24.266 --> 34:26.266
Okay.

34:26.319 --> 34:28.770
Here's my question for you.

34:28.772 --> 34:31.688
Reason I got in touch.

34:31.741 --> 34:35.143
Whose money did she use
to make that down payment?

34:35.178 --> 34:36.777
'Cause if it's yours,
you can just call the bank

34:36.830 --> 34:38.446
and void the check, right?

34:38.498 --> 34:40.782
No, we don't have
a joint account.

34:40.833 --> 34:43.083
If she wrote a check,
it's her money.

34:43.119 --> 34:44.619
What kind of married people
don't share

34:44.621 --> 34:46.588
a fucking bank account?

34:46.623 --> 34:47.705
We're not married.

34:47.757 --> 34:48.922
I thought you had a kid
together.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.123
We do.

34:50.177 --> 34:51.208
Oh.

34:51.261 --> 34:53.428
Another?

34:53.463 --> 34:55.096
Yeah, another, both of us.

34:58.301 --> 34:59.767
Come on.

35:07.277 --> 35:08.476
Thank you.

35:17.954 --> 35:21.322
I don't understand why
she'd do something like that

35:21.358 --> 35:22.323
without telling me.

35:22.325 --> 35:24.242
Really? Really?

35:24.294 --> 35:26.661
You don't?

35:26.696 --> 35:29.664
After all this time,
do you still not know her?

35:33.970 --> 35:36.254
You know what you are, Solloway?
You're a tourist.

35:36.306 --> 35:40.008
You're just a fucking tourist.

35:40.060 --> 35:44.512
You drive through this place.
You think it's so charming.

35:46.900 --> 35:50.518
You fall in love it it,
and you want a piece of it.

35:52.989 --> 35:54.789
You think,

35:54.824 --> 35:57.559
"Oh, she's so beautiful.

35:59.429 --> 36:01.462
She's so sad, though.

36:01.498 --> 36:04.365
I can save her.
I can take away her pain.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.835
I can make her see that
life's worth living again."

36:07.871 --> 36:10.338
Wait, I get you.
I get you, man.

36:10.373 --> 36:13.541
I was standing just
where you stood once.

36:13.593 --> 36:14.959
Of course, I was only 18

36:15.011 --> 36:17.845
and she didn't even
have that child yet.

36:20.250 --> 36:23.217
But I got a little secret
for you.

36:23.219 --> 36:25.603
That whole wounded bird thing?

36:28.024 --> 36:31.059
It's an act.

36:31.111 --> 36:33.611
Wasn't Gabriel's death
that broke her heart.

36:35.732 --> 36:40.068
She never fucking had one.

37:06.596 --> 37:08.930
How the fuck did you
find the place?

37:08.932 --> 37:10.848
You sent me a link
when you bought it.

37:10.900 --> 37:13.735
It's still in my phone.

37:13.770 --> 37:16.437
Come on up.

37:16.489 --> 37:18.106
Wow.

37:18.108 --> 37:20.441
This is spectacular, Max.

37:20.493 --> 37:23.277
Thanks, buddy.
I appreciate it.

37:23.330 --> 37:25.913
So what brings you out here
in the middle of the week?

37:25.949 --> 37:27.415
Where are all those children?

37:27.450 --> 37:29.117
Uh, they're with Helen.

37:29.119 --> 37:30.785
Joanie's with the nanny.

37:32.455 --> 37:35.039
I'm looking for Alison.

37:35.091 --> 37:37.959
Looking for her?
What do you mean?

37:38.011 --> 37:39.761
I've lost her.

37:41.297 --> 37:42.964
She's gone.

37:43.016 --> 37:44.465
What?

37:44.517 --> 37:47.552
Yeah, evidently she, uh...

37:47.604 --> 37:49.637
she's bought the Lobster Roll.

37:49.639 --> 37:51.222
She bought the Lobster Roll?

37:51.274 --> 37:52.573
With her ex-husband.

37:52.609 --> 37:54.676
With her... wait, what?

37:54.711 --> 37:56.060
Yeah.

37:56.112 --> 37:57.979
Now she's not answering
her phone.

38:00.450 --> 38:04.068
Wow, that's, um...

38:04.120 --> 38:07.488
wow.

38:07.490 --> 38:10.742
Is that all you have to say?

38:10.794 --> 38:13.244
Give me a second here,
Solloway.

38:13.296 --> 38:16.464
I'm, uh... processing.

38:18.385 --> 38:21.502
Do you think maybe she's...

38:21.504 --> 38:23.971
she's an evil person
or something?

38:24.007 --> 38:27.475
What? No.
Why would you say that?

38:27.510 --> 38:29.177
Because I can't understand
how anyone

38:29.179 --> 38:31.846
could behave like this.

38:31.848 --> 38:35.850
Noah, you've... have you ever
been left before?

38:35.902 --> 38:37.652
Have you ever been dumped?

38:42.025 --> 38:44.358
No.

38:44.411 --> 38:47.028
I have.

38:47.030 --> 38:49.831
Many times, and I can tell you
from personal experience

38:49.866 --> 38:52.166
that people leave for lots
of different reasons.

38:52.202 --> 38:54.368
It's not... it's not just because
they're bad and you're good

38:54.421 --> 38:56.504
or you're bad and they're good.

38:56.539 --> 38:58.790
Sometimes people are just
going through something

38:58.842 --> 39:01.626
and you can't be a part
of it.

39:01.678 --> 39:04.011
Max, no offense, I'm not here
for your general theory

39:04.047 --> 39:05.213
about love.

39:05.265 --> 39:07.098
Well, what are you doing here?

39:09.385 --> 39:12.220
I don't know.

39:12.272 --> 39:14.722
Noah...

39:14.724 --> 39:17.058
...can I say something
you might not want to hear?

39:19.896 --> 39:22.480
When we were younger,
you'd wash up on my front door.

39:22.532 --> 39:25.399
I would've just seen you
the night before or something.

39:25.401 --> 39:29.370
Your troubles, they were just
a part of the...

39:29.405 --> 39:31.489
...scrum of our lives.

39:31.541 --> 39:35.710
We had everything in between...
school, career, friends.

39:35.745 --> 39:38.913
I'd see you, what,
three times a week?

39:38.965 --> 39:43.334
But now, Noah,
I got to be honest, um,

39:43.386 --> 39:47.922
it feels like it's only
the washing-up part,

39:47.957 --> 39:50.758
like there is no in-between.

39:50.810 --> 39:53.261
- Okay, do you want me to leave?
- No, I don't.

39:53.263 --> 39:55.179
I want you to unload whatever
you got on your chest,

39:55.231 --> 39:57.682
and then I want you to fucking
call me in a couple days

39:57.734 --> 40:01.936
and invite me to dinner,
ask me how I am.

40:03.656 --> 40:04.856
I'm sorry, Max.

40:04.908 --> 40:07.775
I guess I was embarrassed.

40:07.777 --> 40:10.044
Last time I saw you was...

40:10.079 --> 40:13.030
That party was a low point,
yeah.

40:13.082 --> 40:16.083
I should've called you.
I'm sorry I'm a dick.

40:16.119 --> 40:19.754
How are you?

40:19.789 --> 40:23.090
I'm good.

40:23.126 --> 40:25.543
Yeah, hey, thanks for asking.

40:25.595 --> 40:28.429
Been spending a lot of time
out here just...

40:28.464 --> 40:30.665
...being alone, man.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.800
It's really
sort of revelatory.

40:32.802 --> 40:35.970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:36.022 --> 40:37.471
I wouldn't know.

40:41.444 --> 40:44.645
So... Alison.

40:44.647 --> 40:46.397
Tell me.

40:46.449 --> 40:49.066
So all this time, I thought
she was getting her post-bac

40:49.118 --> 40:52.069
so she could go to medical
school, and I was paying for it

40:52.121 --> 40:53.487
because I thought
it might make her happy,

40:53.489 --> 40:54.906
and it turns out
it's all bullshit.

40:54.958 --> 40:58.292
She quit her course
six weeks ago.

40:58.328 --> 40:59.861
What has she been doing
since then?

40:59.896 --> 41:02.330
I have no fucking idea.

41:02.332 --> 41:04.665
What are you gonna do now?

41:04.717 --> 41:06.500
What, you mean when she
finally makes it home?

41:06.502 --> 41:08.169
If she makes it home?
I don't know.

41:08.171 --> 41:12.506
I can't...
I can't trust her.

41:12.508 --> 41:13.674
How do you have
a relationship

41:13.676 --> 41:15.593
with someone you can't trust?

41:15.645 --> 41:17.595
Well, I mean, it can't come
as a total surprise, right?

41:17.647 --> 41:19.680
I mean, the relationship
did start as an affair.

41:19.716 --> 41:21.449
So?

41:21.484 --> 41:23.317
So I'm just saying maybe
we could've seen this coming.

41:23.353 --> 41:24.602
We have a child together.

41:24.654 --> 41:27.688
I know. I know.

41:27.690 --> 41:30.825
You could always
go back to Helen.

41:30.860 --> 41:32.894
She still loves you.
I'm certain of that.

41:32.929 --> 41:35.796
No, she doesn't.

41:35.832 --> 41:39.500
She has a new boyfriend.
She's bananas about him.

41:41.754 --> 41:44.038
Who is he?

41:44.090 --> 41:48.626
He's the doctor
who operated on Martin.

41:48.678 --> 41:51.462
You're kidding me.

41:51.514 --> 41:52.847
I wish I was.

41:56.219 --> 41:59.687
What's he like?

41:59.722 --> 42:02.223
I don't know.
I'm not fucking him.

42:05.862 --> 42:07.561
What do you think
she sees in him?

42:11.234 --> 42:14.235
Besides the fact he's
a perfect-looking surgeon?

42:15.905 --> 42:17.905
I mean...

42:17.907 --> 42:20.207
do you think she's in love?

42:22.078 --> 42:23.744
Why do you care, Max?

42:30.053 --> 42:32.586
Why do you care, Max?

42:45.652 --> 42:49.270
Did you...

42:49.322 --> 42:51.105
did you fuck my wife?

42:56.329 --> 42:57.361
Your ex-wife.

42:57.413 --> 42:59.380
Did you fuck my fucking wife?

43:10.293 --> 43:12.126
It's Waterford Crystal,
no big deal.

43:18.851 --> 43:20.134
I love her, Noah.

43:23.473 --> 43:24.638
I always have.

43:26.943 --> 43:28.442
I know I shouldn't
have done it,

43:28.478 --> 43:31.729
but I thought, when you left,
I thought maybe

43:31.781 --> 43:35.282
this was what was supposed
to happen all along.

43:35.318 --> 43:37.401
Maybe...

43:37.453 --> 43:42.289
...all these years
of being your third wheel

43:42.325 --> 43:45.026
were leading to this,
to my chance.

43:45.061 --> 43:48.162
What?
What?

43:48.214 --> 43:50.464
What, so this...
our whole friendship

43:50.500 --> 43:52.666
has been about
some kind of competition

43:52.668 --> 43:54.602
with you playing
the long game?

43:54.637 --> 43:56.921
No.

43:56.973 --> 43:58.472
What, waiting in the wings

43:58.508 --> 44:00.141
till I show
a moment of weakness?

44:00.176 --> 44:01.509
A moment of weakness?

44:01.511 --> 44:03.644
Come in and steal
my fucking wife?

44:03.679 --> 44:05.646
She's not your wife!

44:05.681 --> 44:07.681
You left.

44:07.683 --> 44:08.849
Twice.

44:08.851 --> 44:10.551
She took you back.
You did it again.

44:10.586 --> 44:12.987
You didn't want
to fucking be there, Noah.

44:13.022 --> 44:16.524
And you would tell anyone
who would fucking listen.

44:16.526 --> 44:18.993
She knew it.
I knew it.

44:19.028 --> 44:20.694
Hell, your kids
probably knew it,

44:20.696 --> 44:23.781
but you had no appreciation
for what you had.

44:23.833 --> 44:27.451
All you wanted,
all you've ever wanted is more.

44:27.503 --> 44:29.904
I wanted her.

44:29.939 --> 44:34.041
That's it.
That's all I ever wanted.

44:34.043 --> 44:35.709
So when you
kicked her to the curb

44:35.711 --> 44:38.512
like a piece of trash,
I thought this was my chance

44:38.548 --> 44:42.016
to make her happy because
I knew that I could devote

44:42.051 --> 44:45.186
my whole self to her
in a way that you never would.

44:50.610 --> 44:53.394
But she didn't want me,
man.

44:53.446 --> 44:55.529
She still wanted you.

44:55.565 --> 44:57.064
After everything
you put her through,

44:57.066 --> 44:58.065
I mean, what is it?

44:58.067 --> 44:59.533
I don't understand.

45:02.705 --> 45:05.322
I fought so hard
my whole life for everyone

45:05.374 --> 45:08.242
who's ever loved me,

45:08.294 --> 45:10.211
fought for every bit
of intimacy.

45:10.246 --> 45:12.713
My wife
barely tolerated me.

45:12.748 --> 45:14.782
My children
still don't speak to me.

45:17.053 --> 45:21.388
But you, man, you...

45:21.424 --> 45:24.091
everybody just lets you go,

45:24.143 --> 45:28.562
no matter how hard
you try to blow it up.

45:28.598 --> 45:32.099
I don't get it.

45:32.101 --> 45:35.102
What do you have
that I don't?

45:38.324 --> 45:40.241
- I'm sorry about the glass.
- Don't leave like that, man.

45:40.276 --> 45:42.376
Don't leave like this.
Just say something.

45:42.411 --> 45:43.611
What do you want me to say?

45:43.613 --> 45:46.914
Say that you understand.

45:46.949 --> 45:49.533
Well, I don't.
Sorry.

45:49.585 --> 45:52.536
You say you're my friend,
but you're just jealous of me.

45:52.588 --> 45:55.789
That's not friendship, Max.

45:55.791 --> 45:57.291
Of course it is.

45:57.293 --> 46:00.794
What are you
fucking talking about?

46:00.847 --> 46:03.764
How many times have I bailed
your ass out over the years,

46:03.799 --> 46:04.965
given you a place to crash?

46:05.017 --> 46:06.467
How much money
have I lent you?

46:06.519 --> 46:09.386
I did that
because I love you.

46:09.438 --> 46:13.140
Max...

46:13.192 --> 46:15.893
...your problem is,
you think you can buy people.

46:15.945 --> 46:17.511
You think people
have a price.

46:17.547 --> 46:20.681
And you can tell yourself
any story you want,

46:20.716 --> 46:24.818
but you paid me $50,000
so you could fuck my wife.

46:24.871 --> 46:26.787
That's what happened.

46:31.661 --> 46:33.327
The reason
nobody loves you, Max,

46:33.379 --> 46:36.130
is because without your money,
you're...

46:36.165 --> 46:37.331
you're invisible.

46:37.383 --> 46:39.133
You're fucking nothing.

48:04.754 --> 48:07.087
First of all, I'm sorry,

48:07.139 --> 48:10.924
but please don't be mad.

48:10.926 --> 48:13.727
I'm not mad.

48:13.763 --> 48:18.015
I mean, I was mad
about six hours ago.

48:18.067 --> 48:21.435
Now I'm just really tired.

48:21.487 --> 48:25.439
So what's going on, Alison?

48:25.491 --> 48:27.441
I bought this place.

48:27.493 --> 48:31.111
I heard.
With Cole.

48:31.113 --> 48:32.346
Who told you?

48:34.617 --> 48:39.119
Look, anyway, I've decided
this is what I want to do

48:39.171 --> 48:40.954
with the money from the house.

48:43.626 --> 48:44.925
Okay.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.393
And I couldn't afford it
on my own,

48:46.429 --> 48:48.879
so Cole and I decided
to go in together

48:48.931 --> 48:50.631
as business partners.

48:50.633 --> 48:52.466
- Business partners?
- Yes.

48:54.804 --> 48:57.054
And you thought it was
totally okay to make

48:57.106 --> 49:00.441
such a life-changing decision
without even asking me?

49:04.980 --> 49:06.947
Now I see why your first
marriage fell apart.

49:11.620 --> 49:13.737
Look, I tried talking to you
this morning about it,

49:13.789 --> 49:15.322
but you seemed so distracted,
and...

49:15.358 --> 49:17.624
Are you serious?

49:17.660 --> 49:19.026
You mean while you were
in the shower?

49:19.061 --> 49:20.828
Look, it happened
really quickly.

49:20.880 --> 49:22.996
Cole called me up last night,
and there just wasn't time

49:23.049 --> 49:24.498
to have a conversation
about it.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.834
I had to decide quickly.

49:29.338 --> 49:32.923
Alison, I've been trying

49:32.975 --> 49:34.842
really, really hard
this year

49:34.894 --> 49:38.512
to understand you,
to understand...

49:38.514 --> 49:40.147
...you're from
a different world.

49:40.182 --> 49:43.317
You're... you've been through
different experiences.

49:43.352 --> 49:45.519
You're different,
and I need to accept that,

49:45.571 --> 49:49.857
but this isn't gonna work
if you can't communicate

49:49.909 --> 49:52.693
or compromise.

49:52.695 --> 49:54.695
You can't just
do anything you want

49:54.697 --> 49:56.280
without even
at least talking to me.

49:56.332 --> 49:57.948
I was afraid you'd say no.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.200
Well, I probably would have.

50:00.252 --> 50:02.202
Most men would think that you
going into business

50:02.254 --> 50:04.505
with your ex-husband,
who, if you remember correctly,

50:04.540 --> 50:07.708
wants to kill me,
is not a good fucking idea.

50:09.545 --> 50:12.045
I'm sorry,

50:12.047 --> 50:13.847
but this
is what I want to do.

50:26.395 --> 50:29.062
When were you gonna tell me
about dropping out of school?

50:32.785 --> 50:35.569
Now?

50:35.571 --> 50:37.404
I'm sorry.

50:37.406 --> 50:41.992
I guess I was embarrassed
because I couldn't handle it.

50:42.044 --> 50:44.661
It was too hard.

50:44.713 --> 50:46.880
Look, look,
this could be good for us.

50:46.916 --> 50:48.665
- For us?
- Yes.

50:48.717 --> 50:50.417
It's a good investment...
a great one, actually.

50:50.469 --> 50:53.170
This restaurant is right
at the entrance to town.

50:53.222 --> 50:56.089
Every summer,
they mint money here.

50:56.091 --> 50:58.509
I could keep us going
off the profits.

50:58.561 --> 50:59.893
You wouldn't have
to teach anymore.

50:59.929 --> 51:01.512
You could take as long
as you wanted

51:01.564 --> 51:02.563
to write your next book.

51:02.598 --> 51:03.764
No, no, no.

51:03.799 --> 51:05.766
- Why not?
- Because...

51:09.238 --> 51:12.739
Do you love me?

51:12.775 --> 51:13.974
Of course I do.

51:14.009 --> 51:16.276
Then don't do this.

51:16.278 --> 51:18.278
For me.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.248
I really don't want you
to do it, okay?

51:21.283 --> 51:22.950
I'll figure out
something for us.

51:22.952 --> 51:24.952
I'll... things are okay
at the moment.

51:25.004 --> 51:27.621
I'll write another book,
quickly, if I need to,

51:27.673 --> 51:29.756
but just not this.

51:33.128 --> 51:36.296
- It's already done.
- Back out.

51:36.332 --> 51:37.764
I...

51:49.695 --> 51:51.812
Are you fucking him again?

51:51.814 --> 51:54.281
I knew you'd ask that.

51:54.316 --> 51:58.652
- Well, are you?
- No. No, I'm not.

51:58.704 --> 51:59.953
Do you believe me?

52:02.992 --> 52:04.958
You have to trust me, Noah.

52:07.062 --> 52:09.830
I want to do this for myself.

52:09.832 --> 52:11.431
I don't want to be a doctor.

52:11.467 --> 52:14.084
No? You don't?
'Cause you told me that...

52:14.136 --> 52:17.271
I know, but it wasn't right.
It's not for me.

52:17.306 --> 52:19.172
Look, you're so lucky.

52:19.225 --> 52:21.475
You know exactly what you
want to do with your life.

52:21.510 --> 52:23.310
I don't.

52:23.345 --> 52:26.313
I just know
I want to do something.

52:26.348 --> 52:29.149
I don't just want to be
your wife or Joanie's mother.

52:29.184 --> 52:31.351
I know, that's why we decided
you'd go back to school.

52:31.403 --> 52:35.188
I spent the last six weeks
walking around the city.

52:35.241 --> 52:37.991
I've crossed the Brooklyn
Bridge, like, 50 times

52:38.027 --> 52:41.528
trying to find an insight
into myself, trying to...

52:41.564 --> 52:42.696
Okay, okay.

52:47.586 --> 52:49.736
So what did you figure out?

52:53.008 --> 52:55.042
Just that I miss home.

52:57.880 --> 53:01.148
Look, this is who I am, Noah.

53:01.183 --> 53:05.385
I don't belong at those
fancy book parties.

53:05.387 --> 53:08.138
I'm just a girl from Montauk.

53:08.190 --> 53:09.556
This is my home.

53:09.558 --> 53:13.026
This is where I belong.

53:21.370 --> 53:25.205
So I mean, how does this work?
You gonna move back out here?

53:25.240 --> 53:26.873
I don't know.

53:26.909 --> 53:28.241
You taking Joanie with you?

53:28.294 --> 53:30.944
I thought maybe we could
split our time.

53:30.980 --> 53:32.346
What about my other kids?

53:32.381 --> 53:33.997
I mean, they're gonna
split their time?

53:34.049 --> 53:35.749
- They're in school.
- I don't know, Noah.

53:35.801 --> 53:37.584
I don't know how it's all
gonna work out.

53:37.586 --> 53:40.087
I just...

53:40.089 --> 53:44.758
I just hoped we could
figure it out together.

53:54.670 --> 53:57.404
Can we, please?

54:03.679 --> 54:04.945
<i>May we approach, Your Honor?</i>

54:04.980 --> 54:06.613
You may.

54:11.120 --> 54:14.538
Your Honor, I have a motion
to amend my witness list.

54:14.590 --> 54:16.623
I'm sorry, we've been
in preparation for months,

54:16.625 --> 54:18.925
and you're just coming forward
with this now?

54:18.961 --> 54:21.461
Witness just contacted
the DA's office last evening

54:21.513 --> 54:24.464
with information
about the defendant's car.

54:24.466 --> 54:26.967
Is this witness
a car mechanic?

54:26.969 --> 54:28.468
You wish he were, Jon.

54:28.470 --> 54:30.270
Here's a summation
of his statement.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.161
- And what time was it?
- About 10:30 p.m.

54:54.213 --> 54:56.296
I'd been feeling
under the weather,

54:56.331 --> 54:57.998
decided to turn in early.

54:58.050 --> 55:00.801
I got into bed, and that's
when I heard something.

55:00.836 --> 55:03.003
What did you hear?

55:03.055 --> 55:05.005
I heard a car.

55:05.007 --> 55:08.475
And then the god-awful
motion-sensitive lights

55:08.510 --> 55:11.678
went on in the drive,
so I got up,

55:11.730 --> 55:13.680
went to the window.

55:13.716 --> 55:17.350
And whose car was it?

55:17.403 --> 55:19.052
Noah Solloway.

55:21.356 --> 55:24.691
Did he call or ring the bell?

55:24.693 --> 55:27.060
No, the house lights were out.

55:27.096 --> 55:28.662
My car was in the shop.

55:28.697 --> 55:30.113
It's my vacation residence,

55:30.165 --> 55:35.001
so I think he assumed
I wasn't home.

55:35.037 --> 55:37.204
Objection. Conjecture.

55:37.239 --> 55:39.239
Stay with what you witnessed.

55:41.677 --> 55:43.243
I got up,
threw on some jeans.

55:43.278 --> 55:45.712
I thought he was maybe
there for a drink,

55:45.748 --> 55:48.682
but that wasn't the case.

55:48.717 --> 55:52.886
Then I heard the hose
in the front go on,

55:52.921 --> 55:54.921
so I went back
to the windows.

55:54.957 --> 55:57.390
And what did you see?

55:57.443 --> 55:59.826
Noah hosing off
the front of his car.

55:59.862 --> 56:01.928
Are you sure
it was Mr. Solloway?

56:01.964 --> 56:04.231
Yeah, I'm sure.

56:04.233 --> 56:06.867
The floodlights
were pretty bright,

56:06.902 --> 56:11.471
and we've been friends
for almost 30 years.

56:12.908 --> 56:15.075
It was him.

56:15.077 --> 56:17.327
And then what happened?

56:17.379 --> 56:19.412
Nothing, he finished
what he was doing,

56:19.414 --> 56:22.415
got back into his car,
and he drove away.

56:22.417 --> 56:25.919
After he was gone, did you
investigate the driveway?

56:28.590 --> 56:30.724
I did.

56:30.759 --> 56:34.261
What did you find?

56:34.313 --> 56:35.595
I found blood.

56:39.434 --> 56:41.101
No further questions.

56:43.772 --> 56:47.407
Order!
Quiet in the court!
