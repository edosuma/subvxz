MAN:
<i>What gives, buttercup?</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:10.642
How come
you didn't order anything?

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
I wasn't that hungry.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.246
What have I always said?

00:15.582 --> 00:17.416
BOTH:
Ice cream

makes everything better.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.519
(chuckles)

00:20.554 --> 00:22.521
It's true. It's true.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.258
(chuckles)

00:26.293 --> 00:28.560
I really liked him.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.795
I know.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.696
Clearly, the boy's an idiot.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.131
(chuckles) Papa.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.200
You know how many times I...

00:35.235 --> 00:37.302
I had to ask
your grandmother out

00:37.337 --> 00:39.571
before she agreed to a date?

00:39.606 --> 00:41.273
Huh.
17.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.276
(chuckles) Okay, well, nowadays,
they call that stalking.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.410
(chuckles) Well,

00:45.445 --> 00:47.179
63 years married.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.581
I must have done
something right.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.383
I'm just saying

00:51.418 --> 00:53.819
that if this young man

00:53.854 --> 00:56.288
really wanted
a serious relationship with you,

00:56.323 --> 00:59.691
he would have fought for you.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.525
You deserve better.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.127
Thanks, Papa.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.570
You guys okay?
Hey, get out of here.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.572
Get out of here.
He won't get out of the way.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.640
Get out. Hey!
(bursts of gunfire)

01:15.675 --> 01:17.209
Back! Stay down!

01:17.244 --> 01:19.578
Get out.
- Go. Go.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.612
Go, go, go, go.

Yeah.
Uh-huh. (chuckles)

Let's see about that. Come here.
You like that? (laughs)

03:42.489 --> 03:44.656
No? Like that...

03:44.691 --> 03:47.325

03:51.498 --> 03:53.031
STEVE:
What have we got here?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.432
Well, there was a stickup
at a credit union

03:54.467 --> 03:55.767
five blocks from here.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.436
Second bank job in
a week, by the way.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.938
The perps were making
their getaway,

03:59.973 --> 04:02.374
ate this stop sign,
T-boned this car here.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.875
After that,

04:03.910 --> 04:05.777
they carjacked
the nearest motorist

04:05.812 --> 04:07.512
and fled the scene.
Chin's over there

04:07.547 --> 04:09.281
talking to the lady who
was driving this car.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.683
She was treated
for minor injuries,

04:11.718 --> 04:14.853
but, uh, she had her
grandfather in the car, man.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.421
He wasn't so lucky.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.789
Paramedics declared him
dead on the scene

04:20.026 --> 04:21.726
Hey, there's something
you guys should know

04:21.761 --> 04:23.528
about the accident victim.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.699
Excuse me, guys.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.034
Can you give me
a second, please?

04:29.069 --> 04:31.503
Thank you. Thanks.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.571
Hey, Amanda.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.840
Hey.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.009
My name's
Commander Steve McGarrett.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.313
I wanted to say I'm really sorry
for your loss.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.615
Your grandfather

04:43.650 --> 04:45.717
was a true hero.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.319
I'm sorry.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.422
My grandfather-- the man
I'm actually named after--

04:50.457 --> 04:52.557
he served on the<i> Arizona,</i> too.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.392
Unfortunately...

04:54.427 --> 04:56.995
he didn't make it
off the ship that day.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.334
I was upset about breaking up
with my boyfriend,

05:02.369 --> 05:05.370
so he offered to take me
for ice cream.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.105
I feel so stupid...

05:07.140 --> 05:09.474
Wait a minute. This is...
This is not your fault.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.608
You understand me?

05:10.643 --> 05:14.045
He survived
Pearl Harbor, World War II

05:14.080 --> 05:16.715
and two bouts of cancer...

05:16.750 --> 05:18.917
just to die like this.

Oh. (sniffs)

06:16.843 --> 06:18.777
Looks to me
like it's part of a bone.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.445
Okay. So?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.913
Well, so if it's human,

06:21.948 --> 06:24.716
it could mean this site was once
a heiau or burial ground.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.451
Well, that seems
like all the more reason

06:26.486 --> 06:27.786
not to do anything about it.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.421
I'm sorry?

06:29.456 --> 06:31.156
This whole island
is a burial ground.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.091
If we stopped construction
every time a bone turned up,

06:33.126 --> 06:34.426
nothing would ever get built.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.428
I understand,

06:36.463 --> 06:39.431
but aren't we required
to report it?

06:39.466 --> 06:41.065
You're not hearing me.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.535
Something like this could
shut us down for months.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.803
All because 20 years ago,

06:44.838 --> 06:47.439
some guy decided to bury
his dog in the backyard.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.174
We're permitted.
We've broken ground.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.742
So drop this.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.177
Yes, sir.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.820
LEONARD:
<i>When the first bomb hit,</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:04.522
it kicked a huge swell

07:04.557 --> 07:06.758
over the portside of the ship,

07:06.793 --> 07:08.760
throwing men overboard.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.062
My first thought was that, uh,

07:11.097 --> 07:12.931
we'd been torpedoed.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.466
Since I was a member

07:14.501 --> 07:17.602
of the fire team,
I raced below deck,

07:17.637 --> 07:20.071
took my station
next to Gun Four.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.874
That's the only reason
I'm still here.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.677
The next bomb hit
on the other side of the ship.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.545
I was far enough away
from the blast

07:27.580 --> 07:29.714
to survive.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.484
Where'd you get this?

07:32.519 --> 07:33.718
It's from a documentary

07:33.753 --> 07:36.187
commemorating
the 75th anniversary

07:36.222 --> 07:38.156
of Pearl Harbor.
I reached out to the filmmaker,

07:38.191 --> 07:40.558
and he hit me back
and forwarded me

07:40.593 --> 07:41.793
Patterson's full interview.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.795
You guys got something there?
Uh, yeah.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.896
No match on the blood,

07:44.931 --> 07:46.798
but Chin's got the security
footage from the bank

07:46.833 --> 07:48.733
cued up and ready to go.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.876
GROVER: These guys were in
and out of this place

07:57.911 --> 07:58.977
in under a minute.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.078
They were smart, too.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.079
They knew
the police response times,

08:01.114 --> 08:03.014
and they only went after
the cash in the drawers.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.616
What'd they get?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.084
Just under $12,000.
I guess that's not bad

08:06.119 --> 08:07.285
for 60 seconds.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.521
Yeah. But the weird thing is
the two banks they hit this week

08:09.556 --> 08:11.155
were both military
credit unions.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.824
Yeah, I don't know
if that's a coincidence.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.225
Chin, play it back again.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.794
All right, check this out.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.062
They're all packing

08:18.097 --> 08:19.030
M4 carbine rifles, right?

08:19.065 --> 08:22.166
That's standard issue
for U.S. infantry. Okay?

08:22.201 --> 08:23.868
Look at the way they stacked up

08:23.903 --> 08:24.969
before they breached
the security of this room.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.171
It's basic
close quarter training.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.774
GROVER:
So they're probably soldiers.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.043
The U.S. military keeps
a database of DNA samples

08:32.078 --> 08:34.646
in case they ever have to identify remains.
All right. I'll reach out

08:34.681 --> 08:36.648
and have them run the blood
we collected from the scene.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.950
All right.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.852
Pulled the property records

08:40.887 --> 08:43.021
but didn't find much.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.291
Was hoping maybe
you could dig deeper?

08:46.326 --> 08:47.225
See if there's anything

08:47.261 --> 08:50.061
that would explain
why bones would be there.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.830
Sure, I suppose
I could do that.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.732
I'm sensing a "but."

08:54.767 --> 08:57.669
Well, as you no doubt heard,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
I finally got my shield.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.606
Oh, no, actually,
I hadn't heard that.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.342
But congrats, Jer.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.810
That's awesome, man.

09:05.845 --> 09:06.945
Thanks.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.114
Anyway, I'm not sure how I feel

09:10.149 --> 09:12.216
about keeping this from
my fellow Five-O team members.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.687
Look, I know how hard you worked

09:15.722 --> 09:16.821
to get that badge.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.856
Which is why you
more than anyone

09:18.891 --> 09:22.093
should understand why I want
to keep this quiet for now.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.363
It took me months
to land this job.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.966
You know,
I'm finally making money

09:28.001 --> 09:30.168
and contributing again.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.036
But if I tell Kono about this,

09:32.071 --> 09:33.771
she'll have to get involved.

09:33.806 --> 09:37.108
They'll shut the site down,
and, you know, not just me

09:37.143 --> 09:40.244
but dozens of guys
could lose their jobs.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.914
All for what could very well
turn out to be nothing.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.918
Okay.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.786
I'll see what I can find out.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.288
But if you really
want to know for sure

09:50.323 --> 09:52.256
what we're dealing with,

09:52.291 --> 09:54.859
you should try to get your hands
on another bone fragment.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.093
Could you get it analyzed?

09:56.129 --> 10:00.098
Sure. Then Noelani could tell us
if it's an animal or human.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
Not to mention how old it is.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.268
It's the only way
to get a definitive answer.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.944
Looks like
they were expecting us.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.013
Windows are all boarded up,
so we can't get a visual.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.748
Okay, well, looks like
he's alone, though.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.150
Thermal shows only one
heat signature inside.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.352
All right, guys, listen up.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.655
DNA from our car crash
led us to this man.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.890
Nicholas Rider.
Up until ten months ago,

10:25.925 --> 10:28.292
he was a private security
contractor in Afghanistan.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.762

the property was originally

24:40.612 --> 24:41.845
Now, in order
to secure permits,

24:41.880 --> 24:43.814
the original builder
had to conduct

24:43.849 --> 24:45.682
an exhaustive
geological survey,

24:45.717 --> 24:47.017
which had to be
signed off

24:47.052 --> 24:49.653
by the Department
of Historic Preservation.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.522
They confirmed that
the property had never

24:51.557 --> 24:53.257
been the site of a heiau
or burial ground.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.559
Well, hold on.

24:55.594 --> 24:58.128
If... If the survey was
conducted in the early '90s...

24:58.163 --> 24:59.563
Yeah, the means
the bone you found is

24:59.598 --> 25:01.064
only 25 to 30 years old.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.934
Which isn't a big deal
if it belonged to an animal.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.270
But it's a major deal
if it was human.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.005
Exactly.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.139
If it makes you feel
any better,

25:09.174 --> 25:11.108
I looked into
the previous owners,

25:11.143 --> 25:13.710
and none of them come across
as the murdering type.

25:13.745 --> 25:15.779
I mean, there's no
criminal record,

25:15.814 --> 25:16.980
no glaring red flags.

25:17.015 --> 25:21.018
What about other people who
had access to the property?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.020
Like the original developer,

25:23.055 --> 25:26.189
or any realtors who
handled the transactions.

25:26.224 --> 25:29.626
That information should
all be in public records.

25:29.661 --> 25:30.928
Let me see what
I can find out.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.163
(phone ringing)

25:35.367 --> 25:37.535
I'll be right back.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.737
Hey.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.105
KONO (over phone):
Hi yourself.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.607
I missed you this morning.

25:43.642 --> 25:44.841
Yeah, I had to get
an early start.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.243
I-I didn't want
to wake you.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.178
I would have been okay
with that.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.646
How's work?

25:49.681 --> 25:52.649
Uh, good, yeah.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.785
They sent me on a supply run.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.320
Looks like I won't
be around for lunch.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.322
Oh, thank goodness,
because I have officially

25:58.357 --> 26:00.057
run out of sandwich ideas.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.858
Plus, I didn't want you
to think

26:01.893 --> 26:03.126
that I'm coming
to check up on you.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.662
Yeah? Very funny.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.331
Look, I got to run.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.332
Talk to you later?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.200
Sounds good.
Love you.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.202
Love you, too.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.241
Hey, Adam?

26:19.878 --> 26:21.845
Okay, check this out.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.014
The realtor who originally
sold the property

26:24.049 --> 26:26.249
in the '90s was this guy,

26:26.284 --> 26:28.285
Daniel Nesmith.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.220
I ran his name,
and it turns out

26:30.255 --> 26:32.089
his wife Julie went missing
around the same time

26:32.124 --> 26:33.890
that the property was sold.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.226
Okay, that can't be
a coincidence.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.861
Probably not,
considering the fact

26:37.896 --> 26:40.230
that she never turned up.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.999
So was Nesmith ever charged?

26:42.034 --> 26:44.267
No. HPD turned up evidence

26:44.302 --> 26:46.003
that he was having
an affair.

26:46.038 --> 26:46.804
But when they
questioned him,

26:46.839 --> 26:48.338
he said his wife
had packed her bags

26:48.373 --> 26:50.173
and walked out
on him one day.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.675
And without a body,
they couldn't

26:51.710 --> 26:54.711
continue the investigation
as a murder.

26:54.746 --> 26:55.879
The cops probably
didn't think to

26:55.914 --> 26:57.848
search all of Nesmith's
property listings.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.117
No, 'cause burying
a body somewhere like that

27:00.152 --> 27:01.118
just doesn't make
any sense.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.655
Well, it does if you get
the body in the ground

27:04.690 --> 27:06.923
right before the
foundation is poured.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.326
And you don't consider
that the house will be

27:09.361 --> 27:11.328
torn down 20 years later.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.231
I think it's time
we notified Five-O.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.767
Yeah. No, you're right.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.403
Uh, first thing
tomorrow morning,

27:19.438 --> 27:20.971
I'll tell Kono.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.172
Tomorrow?

27:22.207 --> 27:24.441
How about sooner?
Like right now, maybe?

27:24.476 --> 27:28.412
Because it's still
just a theory.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.116
And I have an idea
how we can prove it.

27:34.352 --> 27:36.019
I got your text.
What's going on?

27:36.054 --> 27:37.921
Yeah, so I pulled
the security footage

27:37.956 --> 27:39.122
from the credit
union that Campbell

27:39.157 --> 27:42.459
visited today--
check this out.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.994
What, he likes
the reading material?

27:44.029 --> 27:45.996
DANNY: Doesn't look like
he's casing the joint.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.064
Who's this guy?

27:47.099 --> 27:48.298
CHIN:
That's the bank manager.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.400
I reached out to him,
and apparently

27:50.435 --> 27:52.035
he came in asking
for an extension

27:52.070 --> 27:53.203
on a lien payment.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.205
And the thing is,
the extension

27:55.240 --> 27:58.442
he was looking for is for
a property he doesn't own.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.877
Who owns it?

28:03.815 --> 28:07.017
WOMAN:<i> Noah was three years old</i>
<i>when his dad was killed.</i>

28:07.052 --> 28:10.187
And I was worried
that I couldn't be

28:10.222 --> 28:12.889
both a mom and
a dad for him.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.792
But now he has these three
amazing father figures

28:15.827 --> 28:16.893
in his life.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.829
Right. And Lee Campbell,

28:18.864 --> 28:21.732
he's, um, he's been
taking care of you,

28:21.767 --> 28:22.933
helping with the mortgage?

28:22.968 --> 28:24.000
Um, yeah.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.936
The bills really
got on top of me,

28:25.971 --> 28:28.205
and then the bank
threatened to foreclose.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.908
When I told Lee, he offered
to speak to the bank for me.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.443
He did more
than that, right?

28:33.478 --> 28:35.912
Taking care of the lien,
don't you think?

28:35.947 --> 28:37.447
$24,000 to date.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.382
What?

28:39.417 --> 28:41.051
No, that doesn't sound right.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.953
I can assure you it is.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.822
Detective, why don't
you go ahead and

28:45.857 --> 28:47.057
tell me why you're
really here.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.527
Okay, um...

28:50.562 --> 28:53.830
I-I believe that, uh,
in wanting to help you,

28:53.865 --> 28:56.199
these guys, they may
have crossed a line.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.400
What are you talking about?

28:57.435 --> 29:00.070
Uh, we have reason to believe
that Lee Campbell, Nick Rider,

29:00.105 --> 29:02.339
Chris Davis,
and Bobby Mullin

29:02.374 --> 29:04.541
have robbed, recently,
two... two banks.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.511
No, that's impossible.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.546
This is exactly like what
happened in Afghanistan--

29:09.581 --> 29:11.314
they're being railroaded
for no good reason.

29:11.349 --> 29:16.052
Uh, no, Mrs. Warren.
Uh, Nicholas Rider's DNA

29:16.087 --> 29:17.354
was found at a crime scene.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.890
We went to arrest him,
and he opened fire,

29:19.925 --> 29:22.259
wounding four SWAT guys
pretty bad.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.495
We had no choice
but to engage, and, um...

29:25.530 --> 29:27.865
uh, I'm sorry,
but he's-he's dead.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.401
Oh, my God.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.337
Look, we don't think
that you are responsible

29:34.372 --> 29:36.273
in any way for any of this,

29:36.308 --> 29:37.440
but we think that
you can help us.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.042
Detective, I think
you should leave.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.311
Mrs. Warren...
- Get out.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.548
Thank you for the tea

29:44.583 --> 29:45.849
and your time. I'm...

29:45.884 --> 29:48.151
I'm sorry.
I'll let myself out.

29:48.186 --> 29:51.054
DANNY:
<i>That house belongs to the widow</i>

29:51.089 --> 29:54.157
<i>of a guy named Mason Warren,</i>
<i>who was killed in Afghanistan,</i>

29:54.192 --> 29:56.326
June 2015, by
a suicide bomber.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.461
Then his buddies,
led by Lee Campbell,

29:58.496 --> 30:01.031
went on their little
killing spree-- right?

30:01.066 --> 30:03.867
Why? - That was revenge
for the death of his boy.

30:03.902 --> 30:04.734
That's correct.
Revenge.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.536
And now, the reason
that this same crew

30:06.571 --> 30:08.271
is robbing banks is
to make sure that

30:08.306 --> 30:10.106
this widow does not
lose her home.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.142
That's why Campbell
went to the bank today,

30:12.177 --> 30:14.010
tried to get the bank manager
to extend the foreclosure time.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.545
The guy said no.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.415
If they don't come up with
$17,000 in the next 24 hours,

30:18.450 --> 30:20.417
this widow
and her little boy

30:20.452 --> 30:21.952
lose this house
to the bank.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.020
That's not gonna happen.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.855
Lee Campbell will make
sure that doesn't happen.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.324
His honor is at stake.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.859
No matter how much
heat we put on him,

30:28.894 --> 30:30.360
He ain't gonna stop.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.362
(doorbell rings)

30:32.397 --> 30:34.531
Can I help you?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.399
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Nesmith.

30:36.434 --> 30:38.435
Uh, my name is
Adam Noshimuri,

30:38.470 --> 30:40.136
and I work on
a construction crew.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.538
We're building a house

30:41.573 --> 30:42.939
at a property you
sold a while back.

30:42.974 --> 30:45.141
It's over on
Wanaao Road, in Kailua.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.943
Vaguely remember.

30:46.978 --> 30:48.612
That was a long time ago.
- Yeah.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.180
I understand.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.916
Well, we were demoing
the original house,

30:52.951 --> 30:54.918
and I came across
some boxes in the attic.

30:54.953 --> 30:58.054
You know, old photos
and keepsakes and such.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.522
I was hoping maybe
you could help me

30:59.557 --> 31:02.425
track down the owner so
the stuff could be returned.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.928
Look, tell you what,

31:04.963 --> 31:06.997
here's my business card.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.266
Call me tomorrow morning
when I'm in the office,

31:09.301 --> 31:11.334
and I'll try to find the
contact information for you.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.470
Great. If you could just
dig that up for me,

31:13.505 --> 31:16.039
it would be much appreciated.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.375

35:21.686 --> 35:23.820
(horn blaring)

35:28.226 --> 35:29.325
Mullin is hit!

35:29.360 --> 35:30.627
All right, I'm moving.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.395
I'm moving!
- Move!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.446
I'm out, I'm out.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.282
I'm good. Get out of here!

36:10.868 --> 36:11.768
(grunts)

36:25.283 --> 36:26.249
All right.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.670
So, look, Amanda,
I know, uh,

38:27.705 --> 38:29.372
it's not gonna bring
your grandfather back,

38:29.407 --> 38:31.607
but I figured at least now
you can go to sleep

38:31.642 --> 38:34.344
knowing these guys are not
gonna hurt anybody else.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.045
Yeah.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.014
Thanks for keeping
your promise.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.382
Of course.
(elevator bell dings)

38:44.455 --> 38:47.090
It's too bad
you never got to meet him.

38:47.125 --> 38:50.026
Think you two would have
really gotten along.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.362
I'm sure.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.933
Take care of yourself, okay?

38:56.968 --> 38:58.702
(softly):
Okay.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.140
Hey.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.341
We just heard from Danny.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.777
He talked to the bank about
Kiana Warren's foreclosure.

39:07.812 --> 39:08.911
How'd he do?

39:08.946 --> 39:10.145
Well, it took
a little persuading,

39:10.181 --> 39:12.515
but given the circumstances,
how the whole thing went down,

39:12.550 --> 39:14.050
I think they're gonna
do right by her.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.052
Really? - JERRY: Yeah and once
they forgive the late fees,

39:16.087 --> 39:16.853
put her
on a payment plan,

39:16.888 --> 39:18.054
she should be able
to keep the house.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.455
That's fantastic news.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.623
Go, Danny.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.592
Good for him.
- Adam?

39:22.627 --> 39:23.526
STEVE:
Hey, buddy.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.161
Hey. How you doing, Steve?
How you doing?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.629
All right.
- Yeah.

39:26.664 --> 39:27.497
Good to see you.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.631
You, too.
- Hey, guys.

39:28.666 --> 39:29.632
KONO: Wha--
what's going on?

39:29.667 --> 39:30.600
You don't have
to be at work?

39:32.804 --> 39:35.905
(smacks lips)
Um, can we talk for a minute?

39:35.940 --> 39:38.541
Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:40.511 --> 39:41.978
There. Right there.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.599
Oh, my God.

(indistinct radio transmission)

40:19.884 --> 40:21.651
Hey, let's call the DPP,

40:21.686 --> 40:23.019
have them suspend
the building permit.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.587
I want everyone
cleared out of here

40:24.622 --> 40:25.788
and let's tape off the scene.

40:25.823 --> 40:27.723
Wait, hold on.
You're shutting us down?

40:27.758 --> 40:29.692
Yeah, you're lucky
that's all I'm doing.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.728
I could charge you with
obstruction of justice.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.102
I don't get it.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.472
Adam, why didn't
you tell me?

40:45.009 --> 40:47.844
I don't know, I...

40:47.879 --> 40:50.046
(sighs)

40:50.081 --> 40:52.482
I guess I just didn't want
to let you down.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.455
You could never let me down.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.660
Just don't ever
lie to me again.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.596
