00:06.000 --> 00:10.280
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:10.360 --> 00:12.480
<i>Yet another blocked player says goodbye.</i>

00:12.560 --> 00:14.400
<i>But before going offline...</i>

00:16.360 --> 00:17.240
Renan?

00:20.880 --> 00:23.480
Whoa, this apartment
is different from mine.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.960
Anybody home?

00:30.200 --> 00:31.080
Renan?

00:31.600 --> 00:34.040
What's up, dude?

00:34.640 --> 00:36.920
-How are you?
-I'm Ana.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.280
No, you're not.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.320
-Do you want a piece of cake?
-No, thanks.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.040
Dude, let's sit down and talk.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.680
-Dude...
-What do you mean you're Ana?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.400
Luma is tired of being ghosted.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
Yeah...

00:54.200 --> 00:57.040
It doesn't look like he's coming.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.640
I guess I'll cook a meal just for one.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.880
Ana is my best friend.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.120
She's the most popular person I know.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.320
So, I decided to be Ana.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.840
-Who makes you feel uneasy?
-Marina.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.680
I tried to get closer to her, but I think
she's distancing herself from me.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.320
I think she's the only one
who suspects that I'm no good.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.040
Luma and JP are the strongest players.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
What should they do?
Kick out the strong ones.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.880
I'd rather be with you in the final

01:23.960 --> 01:25.640
because you're still weak.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.360
I was weak until you arrived.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.560
When you arrived, I became stronger.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.080
There's nothing
I could've done differently.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.920
I was being myself.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.520
-Thanks for visiting.
-No problem.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.160
-We'll meet again out there.
-Nice.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.760
Maybe I needed more time

01:39.840 --> 01:43.080
to be able to blend in more
with the other players.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.480
Wow, he smells good, like bubblegum.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.440
Now it smells like bubblegum in here.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.760
Good night, Circle.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.480
The time has come for Renan
to go to the blocking drawer.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.520
<i>And the players who are not</i>
<i>in the drawer can relax.</i>

02:02.600 --> 02:04.480
When you go to bed

02:04.560 --> 02:07.160
after becoming influencer,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.640
you sleep so well.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.760
<i>May the new day be great.</i>

02:20.280 --> 02:24.120
And to start the day, let's just say...

02:24.200 --> 02:27.880
-Good morning, Circle!
-Good morning, Circle!

02:27.960 --> 02:29.280
Hello.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.840
Good morning.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.400
<i>Ana looks like Dumaresq's bread today.</i>

02:34.480 --> 02:36.160
All musty and moldy.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.640
-"Update your status."
-"Update your status!"

02:42.520 --> 02:45.240
I wanna let them know
that Renan came to visit me.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.720
Circle, update my status.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.320
Renan left the game, comma,
but has entered my life.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.560
What a man! Exclamation mark.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.720
His touches! Exclamation mark.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.720
#LuckyAtCardsUnluckyInLove.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.680
So, Renan visited Ana!

03:03.480 --> 03:04.320
No.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.320
Yes.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.840
"Renan left the game..." Marcel, wake up.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.280
Lucas, she's just kidding!

03:10.640 --> 03:12.560
<i>Wonder Twin powers, disagree.</i>

03:12.640 --> 03:14.200
Circle, message.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.560
I know my worth, and I know my grit.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.680
I don't get outshone in <i>The Circle.</i>

03:20.160 --> 03:22.160
I give my all, body and soul.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.640
#LetsGoToTheFinal.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.560
NEWSFEED

03:27.640 --> 03:30.480
Wow, I nailed it. Poetic, isn't it?

03:30.560 --> 03:32.320
What would you say after reading that?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.440
"Wow, Marina is wonderful."

03:35.880 --> 03:38.040
Are you losing your mind, Marina?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.080
My God, I saved her,

03:40.160 --> 03:42.000
and she criticizes what I said.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.280
Honey, when I said your glow dimmed,

03:44.640 --> 03:47.600
it's because around here,
I don't see your light shining, okay?

03:47.680 --> 03:49.840
Dumaresq didn't like my status.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.640
This is going to start a war.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.760
You can't do this. This is heartless.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.880
Not liking a person's status is heartless.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.760
Dumaresq must be like,
"Who does she think she is, honey?"

04:02.600 --> 04:05.160
Duma, this is me, dude. The real me.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.360
Wow, so ungrateful.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.400
<i>The vibe couldn't get any worse.</i>

04:11.240 --> 04:12.080
<i>I mean...</i>

04:12.160 --> 04:15.680
"Renan left a message."

04:17.520 --> 04:18.600
Oh, my God.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.360
What if he's not Renan?

04:20.440 --> 04:21.800
I'm gonna laugh.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.480
Let's go.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.560
<i>What's up, guys? I'm Renan.</i>

04:27.640 --> 04:30.320
The same Renan you saw there.
I lied just a bit.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.520
<i>I'm actually 30.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:33.080
<i>I tried to be a bit younger</i>

04:33.520 --> 04:36.360
<i>because I thought it'd be easier</i>
<i>to get along with you all.</i>

04:36.440 --> 04:37.600
<i>I think it didn't work.</i>

04:38.200 --> 04:40.800
I'm hard, Brazil.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.720
I'm hard. I couldn't help it.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.240
I know this is a very political game.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.560
<i>Everybody is trying to play the good guy.</i>

04:48.640 --> 04:51.880
You guys are too worried
about earning brownie points. Careful.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.760
He didn't talk about me.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.520
Thanks for the tip, Renan.
All the best to you, okay, cutie?

04:58.120 --> 05:00.000
When I get out, call me.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.560
Luma doesn't care about brownie points.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.480
Of course she does.
Everybody wants to earn brownie points.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.960
-Is Luma trying to butter them up?
-A little.

05:08.040 --> 05:12.160
<i>After that tip, I can't wait to see</i>
<i>who will have the guts to talk</i>

05:12.240 --> 05:14.360
<i>without the "on the fence" filter.</i>

05:14.440 --> 05:16.920
I really need to talk to Dumaresq.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.960
I need to know how he feels about me.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.040
Why does he think
my light is dimmed in <i>The Circle?</i>

05:23.120 --> 05:24.000
So...

05:24.400 --> 05:27.760
Circle, open private chat with Dumaresq.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.520
Good morning, Marina, baby!

05:31.600 --> 05:34.600
Okay, I'm dying to know
what you want to talk about

05:34.680 --> 05:38.160
because I have
a lot to talk about with you.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.440
Circle, message.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.360
Good morning, Dumaresq!

05:43.440 --> 05:47.400
I've been thinking a lot
about that explanation you gave,

05:47.920 --> 05:51.960
and I'd like to know
if I disappointed you at any point.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.080
Send.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.680
Did I block you, honey? Or did I save you?

05:57.760 --> 06:01.480
We have a very long history
here in <i>The Circle.</i>

06:02.120 --> 06:06.200
There's no way this friendship
has ended out of the blue.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.240
Circle, message.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.840
When I said, quote, "start over," unquote,

06:13.320 --> 06:16.000
I wanted to bring back that old Marina,

06:16.080 --> 06:19.760
who was cheerful and talkative.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.800
Send.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.040
He said this for real.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.240

06:25.320 --> 06:28.120
I've lost two people
who were very dear to me.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.920
I didn't want to feel
like I lost you as well.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.160
Send.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.120
Exactly.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.360
Me saving you
and saying that I'm on your side,

06:36.440 --> 06:40.480
that I want you to start over,
that you need to shine brighter,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.160
is the same as saying, "Look,

06:42.720 --> 06:46.200
come with me, stick with me,
we are in this together, Marina."

06:46.280 --> 06:48.160

07:13.000 --> 07:18.120
we are in the final stretch, girl!

07:18.520 --> 07:21.440
Yeah, girl. We're in the final stretch.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.040
THE LAST BOMB

07:36.440 --> 07:37.920
"The last bomb."

07:38.000 --> 07:41.280
Prepare the grenade, JP.
Pull that pin. Hold it.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.800
What is this about?

07:48.760 --> 07:52.080
"You can ask a question to any player,

07:52.160 --> 07:53.880
and they won't know it was you."

07:54.240 --> 07:56.680
That's what I wanted. I love drama.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.120
Wait, but they'll ask me questions, too.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.320
"You are in Anonymous Mode."

08:02.400 --> 08:04.640
Let's go. Circle, message.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.440
Marina, who do you think
made that painting

representing you? And why?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.720

-Whoa there!

08:23.400 --> 08:27.240
The question everybody wanted to ask.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.320
She's gonna say it was me, for sure.

Dumaresq asked that.

Does she think she's on vacation here?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.560
Mr. Anonymous,
I know you asked me to be serious,

11:03.640 --> 11:05.720
Oops, I have to give a serious answer.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.400

11:26.920 --> 11:29.200
She's hot and then cold.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.160
Everything is a joke to her,
even when she blocks someone.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.320
Circle, message. Wow, Ana.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.960
How can such an open-minded person

11:39.040 --> 11:41.680
focus on something so shallow like looks?

11:41.760 --> 11:42.880
Circle, send.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.720
Damn!

11:47.800 --> 11:50.040
I gotta stop
trying to be funny all the time.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.120
I gotta be serious at some point.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.640
This will hurt me.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.480
"You are in Anonymous Mode."
Go, message.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.680
Dumaresq, why didn't you like

12:02.760 --> 12:05.560
Marina's status? Question mark.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.880
Do you think she wasn't grateful?
Question mark.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.040
-Send.
-Send.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.160
This person really nailed it.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.160
Circle, message.

12:19.240 --> 12:25.040
I didn't like Marina's status
because I didn't understand the message.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.960
"Marina and I have talked,
and it's all sorted out now."

12:29.040 --> 12:30.520
Damn, girl...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.840
So, they have been talking, huh?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.480
That person tried to add fuel to a fire
that has already been put out.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.520
A fire that is no longer burning.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.800
Circle, message.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.160
I'm positive Dumaresq knows

12:45.240 --> 12:47.800
that I'm very grateful that he saved me.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.080
Send.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.400
Very nice, Marina, baby!

12:52.480 --> 12:54.400
If only Luma could comment...

12:54.480 --> 12:55.520
She doesn't want to.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.120
In your face.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.160
<i>If this game didn't make you look bad,</i>
<i>you're truly blessed.</i>

13:08.240 --> 13:09.920
ALERT!

13:09.960 --> 13:12.000
-For God's sake!
-Alert.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.560
I'm treating myself right now!

13:15.920 --> 13:18.000
Even at the gym, Circle?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.560
It can't be the ratings.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.840
You wanna bet?

13:21.120 --> 13:22.520
Put it up on the screen.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.840
IT'S TIME FOR THE RATINGS

13:25.760 --> 13:29.240
Jesus, take the wheel!
Because I wanna be number one.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.560
Final stretch, Dumaresq. Focus.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.520
Could this be it? Could it?

13:35.880 --> 13:38.480
Circle, open ratings.

13:39.040 --> 13:39.960
RATINGS

13:40.040 --> 13:42.080
Okay, I have to be strategic.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.240
I'll put Ray in first place
for obvious reasons.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.560
Ray...

13:47.160 --> 13:48.960
is very weak in the game right now.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.480
Third place goes to Ray

13:51.800 --> 13:54.280
because she's part
of the North-Northeast Alliance.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.200
And Luma also believes
she can count on her.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.440
The second place is hers.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.640
My rare jewel, Luma.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.640
Even if she's not who she says she is,

14:06.720 --> 14:08.960
I really like the way she takes a stand.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.880
And in fifth place,

14:10.960 --> 14:12.920
I'll put Ana.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.480
I really like Ana, but...

14:15.840 --> 14:20.240
she's not able to leave the jokes aside.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.960
<i>The Circle</i> is much more than jokes
and stand-up comedy.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.960
Shall we? Shall we play?

14:26.040 --> 14:29.320
Circle, in fourth place, Dumaresq.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.000
He didn't save me,
so I better be careful, right?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.280
In first place,

14:34.120 --> 14:35.520
Dumaresq.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.000
I'll always have him on my side.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.840
Look, I might fall,

14:40.200 --> 14:44.120
but Dumaresq will always want
to see me at the top.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.520
In third place,

14:47.440 --> 14:49.280
I'd like to put Marina.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.400
To prove to her that she can do better.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.360
Circle, fourth place...

14:54.760 --> 14:55.640
Marina.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.520
Between all the other options,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.400
she's the one
I have the least connection with.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.720
She's suspicious of me about the painting.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.600
I don't know what she thinks about me.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.560
In first place, JP.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.840
Because JP is on Luma's side,

15:12.400 --> 15:14.680
and we have evidence that he defends her.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.280
Circle, send my ratings.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.840
"Ratings complete."

15:23.200 --> 15:25.400
This rating is too big of a risk for me.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.840
If I remain at the bottom, dude,

15:28.320 --> 15:31.240
I'll block myself
because I can't do it anymore.

15:31.320 --> 15:36.080
<i>Do you guys realize that this rating</i>
<i>will determine the finalists?</i>

15:42.480 --> 15:44.760
It'll grow. Get bigger, little cake.

15:45.280 --> 15:49.040
I've noticed they are thinking
that I joke too much.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.160
So, now it's time to show
Ana's human side,

15:53.240 --> 15:56.320
that Ana who also has
a bit of drama in her life.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.640
Circle, please...

15:58.720 --> 16:03.600
open chat with Dumaresq, JP, and Luma.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.240
"Ana has invited you to a group chat."

16:09.760 --> 16:11.520
What is this group, Miss Ana?

16:13.160 --> 16:16.720
Luma, JP, and I?
Who doesn't want to hang out with us?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.040
Circle, message.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.840
Hieee! With a bunch of E's.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.280
I decided to create this group chat
because I wanna tell you some things.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.040
Circle, send.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.080
Will she gossip about the others?

16:29.160 --> 16:32.200
You never know when she's kidding
or being serious.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.680
Circle, message.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.440
One, dash, Luma...

16:35.520 --> 16:37.280
I'd like to get closer to you...

16:37.760 --> 16:41.480
"...because you're the only player
I didn't get close to."

16:41.560 --> 16:43.280
"Two, Dumaresq,

16:43.360 --> 16:46.720
I'll never forget what you did for me."

16:47.080 --> 16:49.840
Girl, she created a group chat
to compliment

16:50.320 --> 16:52.480
the most influential players.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.360
Girl...

16:54.720 --> 16:56.040
That's cool, right?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.880
"Cool," Lucas?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.880
Don't be soft!

16:59.960 --> 17:02.760
She's only doing this
because we're the strongest in the game.

17:02.840 --> 17:06.200
For the final strike, I need to talk to JP

17:06.280 --> 17:09.520
and finish it off with a sad story.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.960
Circle, message.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.160
Three, dash,

17:12.240 --> 17:16.200
JP, I apologize again
for mentioning you as a rival.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.520
I have to put a heart for him, too.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.920
Circle, add the red heart emoji. Send.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.160
Perfect. The first part is done.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.720
As a wise man once said, Conga,

17:27.800 --> 17:30.600
"There's a grain of truth in every joke."

17:31.480 --> 17:33.960
Circle, message. Ana,

17:34.040 --> 17:36.040
you reap what you sow.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.120
I hope I can sow good things from you.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.160
Send.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.960
He's throwing shade at her.
"Hey Ana, I helped you. Now what?"

17:45.760 --> 17:48.120
"I hope I can sow good things from you."

17:49.160 --> 17:50.000
It was him, then.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.640
He wants me to stop with the jokes.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.800
He asked that question.
I started in the game...

17:57.600 --> 18:00.240
as the funny one.
He's actually trying to help me.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.400
It's time...

18:03.160 --> 18:05.120
for me to add my drama.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.160
And I won't joke about it.
I'll hold it back.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.960
Circle, message.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.160
That anonymous question
asked me to be serious.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.120
"And JP said that judging
other people's looks is shallow."

18:18.880 --> 18:21.320
I'm a woman, have been obese all my life.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.200
"I was adopted
and have been through a lot in this life

18:24.280 --> 18:26.840
until I became the person
I'm proud to be today."

18:30.560 --> 18:34.120
She said all that stuff, but just wanted
to talk about a sad story of her life.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.480
She's selling herself.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.600
Now it's the second part of the strike.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.120
Circle, message.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.240
Maybe humor has become a shield for me.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.720
I promise I'll continue being playful,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.280
but I'll be a bit serious, too.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.920
Circle, send.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.720
I want you to continue being playful,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.000
but honey, enough is enough.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.360
Are they crying? Is anybody sad about it?

18:58.720 --> 19:01.640
Is anybody...? I hope so.
I hope somebody shed a tear.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.880
Circle, message.

19:05.960 --> 19:11.040
Ana, we all have our pains and stories.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.520
"You became this woman

19:12.600 --> 19:15.360
not only because of all that,
but because you're strong, too.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.880
This is a game for strong people.
Welcome back." Exactly.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.320
Luma will say
she's also been through that.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.040
Wasn't Luma too skinny?

19:24.440 --> 19:27.840
Too skinny. Nowadays,
she comes across as a Valley Girl.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.760
She had to wear a plastic bag
over her shoes so they wouldn't get dirty.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.960
-Really?
-Yes.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.400
Circle, message.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.720
Ana, I totally get it.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.640
I was bullied for being too skinny

19:40.720 --> 19:44.440
and for being a teacher's daughter
in an upper-class school.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.040
But don't let that shield
hide who you are.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.040
Send.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.000
Now everybody is whining?

19:51.640 --> 19:54.280
If so, if I start telling my story...

19:54.880 --> 19:56.800
Oh, honey, there will be tears.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.360
I wanted to cause a commotion,
I wanted people running around the house.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.760
"Poor girl!" But no...

20:03.400 --> 20:06.120
They were like, "Oh, well.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.880
That sucks, Ana."

20:07.960 --> 20:09.400
Circle, message.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.680
"Anyway, guys.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.120
We are whining too much
and getting too philosophical.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.200
LOL.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.800
But this talk was great.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.800
I love these opportunities
when we get to know each other better.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.720
Circle, send!

20:23.600 --> 20:25.640
Ugh, they're so difficult!

20:26.240 --> 20:27.640
Circle, message.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.720
I knew I could count on you all.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.960
"Thank you for having an open heart
and for the serious talk. Kisses."

20:33.480 --> 20:35.200
Yes, you can count on us,

20:35.280 --> 20:37.480
you can vent, you can do anything,

20:37.560 --> 20:38.840
but in the game, honey...

20:39.280 --> 20:40.960
<i>The Circle </i>is only ours.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.040
I wanted to be in that group,
to be part of that clique.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.360
Now I think I have a chance.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.080
I really hope that was an honest talk,

20:49.160 --> 20:52.760
not just a strategy,

20:52.840 --> 20:56.800
since we're very likely
to become influencers.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.840
<i>Great talk, Ana.</i>
<i>Only silence would've beaten it.</i>

21:03.880 --> 21:07.800
<i>These players are closer than ever</i>
<i>to the 300,000 reais.</i>

21:07.880 --> 21:09.920
<i>The show must go on.</i>

21:10.320 --> 21:11.160
ALERT!

21:11.600 --> 21:13.000
-Alert!
-Alert!

21:13.080 --> 21:14.960
Alert!

21:15.040 --> 21:17.080
-Who could it be?
-It's time.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.880
I'm ready, Circle.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
"The rating results are in."

21:23.000 --> 21:24.960
Lord, help me!

21:25.040 --> 21:27.200
Gosh, I don't wanna look.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.560
God Almighty!

21:29.640 --> 21:30.960
I'm scared, I swear.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.800
Please, I'm asking
for at least second place

21:34.880 --> 21:36.680
because fifth is bullshit.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
6TH

21:40.000 --> 21:42.760
Sixth and last place!

21:42.840 --> 21:44.040
Stressful moment.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.040
I liked it, I'm not gonna lie.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.440
I got down to sixth?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.920
Damn, dude.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.920
I wasn't expecting that.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.400
When Luma got here, remember?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.200
Marina was at the top.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.400
-She got involved in drama.
-It's like Mother says,

22:08.480 --> 22:11.800
"Show me your friends,
and I will tell you who you are."

22:12.920 --> 22:14.520
5TH

22:14.640 --> 22:16.280
Ray could be in fifth place.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.640
I just wanna be first place.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.600
When I get nervous, I start wiping things.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.760
Wow, they are plotting.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
I knew it.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.120
So far, I'm just Funny Ana.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.720
This fifth place is for you
to wake up a little.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.560
There's a time for jokes

22:36.640 --> 22:38.440
and a time to be serious.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.200
You gotta know how to balance things.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.720
But hey, so what?
It's not the sixth place.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.680
4TH

22:47.760 --> 22:49.240
Now, in fourth place,

22:49.880 --> 22:51.320
I don't think Ray can escape.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.720
It'll be Ray. And it's your fault,
Miss Marina and Miss Ray.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.680
You're putting them at the top,
and they're placing you at the bottom.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.600
Wake up, both of you.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.680
Whoa!

23:08.960 --> 23:10.600
Luma is worse than Ray?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.600
I'm on your side,

23:12.680 --> 23:14.360
I believe JP is on your side,

23:14.440 --> 23:16.200
now be careful with the other players.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.920
Luma's got JP, Ray, and Dumaresq.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.880
I think there are too many votes
going towards JP, okay?

23:21.960 --> 23:23.880
JP has to go down in the ranking.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.080
My God, I'm top three!

23:26.760 --> 23:28.800
Damn, that's a big responsibility!

23:30.840 --> 23:34.200
<i>This will determine</i>
<i>the last influencers of the game.</i>

23:34.280 --> 23:36.080
<i>Place your bets.</i>

23:39.320 --> 23:42.920
I don't want to be third. I just don't.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.840
I'm getting butterflies in my stomach.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.320
I'm having goosebumps every second.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.960
No!

23:58.920 --> 24:01.840
<i>He's an influencer again, yeah</i>

24:01.920 --> 24:03.480
Thank you, Lord!

24:04.640 --> 24:06.760
We're influencers again, Congão!

24:06.840 --> 24:08.280
What are you after four wins?

24:08.680 --> 24:11.680
Hold on. Champion, two-times champion,
three-times champion...

24:13.240 --> 24:15.960
-Fourth-times?
<i>-"Four-times" champion!</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:17.960
I'm so mad!

24:18.440 --> 24:19.680
1ST, 2ND

24:20.280 --> 24:22.320
It's time. First and second place.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.560
Nice! First place!

24:29.640 --> 24:31.160
Raise your hand, Congão!

24:31.240 --> 24:34.920
<i>The influencer dance</i>

24:38.000 --> 24:42.280
Seriously, how are these people
letting JP fool them?

24:42.360 --> 24:45.120
Somebody block this guy,
for the love of God.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.400
Luma: JP.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.040
Ray: JP.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.360
-And he's using...
-Dumaresq: JP.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.120
...the alliance for that.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.880
It's over!

24:57.320 --> 24:58.800
Oh, my God!

24:59.080 --> 25:01.760
<i>It's hard being popular, right, JP?</i>

25:07.440 --> 25:09.480
ALERT!

25:11.800 --> 25:12.880
-Alert.
-Alert.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.400
"As the most popular players,
JP and Dumaresq..."

25:17.480 --> 25:21.200
"...are now <i>The Circle</i> influencers."

25:21.280 --> 25:24.280
It seems like I'm reading
the same thing from the last ratings.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.600
"The influencers must decide..."

25:27.680 --> 25:30.000
"...who they will block from <i>The Circle."</i>

25:31.600 --> 25:32.720
Oh, my God.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.360
What would be their reason to block me?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.520
The jokes.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.320
-"JP and Dumaresq..."
-"...please go to the Blue Room..."

25:41.400 --> 25:43.600
"...to make your decision."

25:43.680 --> 25:46.760
JP can go to the Blue Room
with his eyes closed.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.760
Dumaresq, too.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.600
May we make the best decision.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.040
Let's decide.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.120
<i>Whoever survives this</i>
<i>will be in the final, just so you know.</i>

26:02.200 --> 26:04.920
<i>-You guys better use this Blue Room!</i>
-Let's go.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.840
Hi! Home sweet home!

26:14.360 --> 26:15.200
Blue Room.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.520
I love so much being here.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.320
I'll try to make a fair decision,
the right decision.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.640
It won't be easy.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.920
Circle, message.

26:30.000 --> 26:30.960
Brother,

26:31.280 --> 26:34.280
first of all, I'd like to say
I'm extremely happy and honored

26:34.360 --> 26:37.200
to be able to share this podium
with you once more.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.080
Unfortunately,
we have a huge responsibility

26:40.160 --> 26:42.280
to decide the fate of someone else.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.680
Circle, send.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.280
We have to decide between four people.

26:48.360 --> 26:49.920
Now it's starting to dawn on me.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.440
Circle, message.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.800
Whoever is in the game at this point

26:54.880 --> 26:56.720
only deserves to stay

26:56.800 --> 26:59.440
if they show themselves to be worthy.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.640
Send.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.080
Will he have any opinions about Luma?

27:07.160 --> 27:09.120
Some issue I might not know about?

27:09.600 --> 27:10.680
Circle, message.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.640
I don't see any negative aspects in Luma.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.280
I like the way she takes a stand,

27:14.360 --> 27:17.040
always showing herself
to be a very upright and fair person.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.720
Do you have anything
to say about her? Send.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.040
Of course I do, JP. Do you think
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut now?

27:25.120 --> 27:26.960
Circle, message.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.720
Luma changed the way we play the game

27:30.800 --> 27:32.600
here in <i>The Circle.</i>

27:32.920 --> 27:36.000
With her honest and open attitude,

27:36.080 --> 27:37.600
everything became different.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.680
Send it, Circle.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.640
Damn, bro, we really do think alike.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.240
It's amazing.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.200
Circle, message.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.800
One of the reasons I'm here

27:50.880 --> 27:53.440
is because Marina trusts me.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.040
"From my point of view,
our goal is to remain influencers.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.240
That way, we will protect
our interests. Got it?"

28:02.200 --> 28:03.840
Circle, message.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.440
Yes, I got it. Then will you save Marina?

28:06.520 --> 28:08.880
Whatever you decide, I'll agree with.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.440
Circle, send.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.760
"Whatever you decide, I'll agree with."
Don't even start, JP.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.840
You keep writing
these complicated messages.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.320
And now you only say
that you agree to whatever I want?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.320
Circle, message.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.640
Regarding Ana,

28:26.720 --> 28:30.240
she doesn't take things seriously
when she has to.

28:30.680 --> 28:31.520
Send.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.080
I like her,

28:34.160 --> 28:36.880
but that didn't look good for her.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.000
Circle, message.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.960
My friend, what about Ray?

28:43.600 --> 28:45.240
I'm a bit suspicious of Ray.

28:45.720 --> 28:46.800
Circle, message.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.880
In the rivals game, she picked me

28:48.960 --> 28:52.160
and said she would win over me
because her strategy is better.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.520
I got that stuck in my head.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.240
Thinking emoji. Send.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.200
Ray has been surprising me.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.320
Circle, message.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.800
I need to keep my eye on her.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.960
Send.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.600
So, it's between Ana and Ray.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.040
Send.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.040
AT-RISK CHAT
ANA, LUMA, MARINA, RAY

29:21.920 --> 29:24.640
Lord have mercy. My heart is racing.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.240
What about you, girls? Question mark.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.560
Send.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.720
You heart isn't racing.
You know they'll save you.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.400
Circle, message.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.600
I gotta admit that I think

29:36.680 --> 29:38.480
I'll be blocked.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.880
"A mix of emotions. I really wanna stay.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.960
#SheFightsInTheHouse."

29:43.040 --> 29:44.960
Ugh, so nerve-wracking.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.600
Circle, message.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.200
Marina,

29:48.280 --> 29:50.520
we're all thinking the same thing.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.200
But a woman should have been
at the top... Ellipsis.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.280
Send.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.560
Exactly, Ana. Our fate

29:58.640 --> 30:00.560
is in the hands of two boys.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.000
Circle, message.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.320
Ana, tell me about it.

30:03.720 --> 30:04.960
With every passing day,

30:05.040 --> 30:09.240
I feel worse about the fact
that I'm going down in the ratings.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.680
I'd like to understand why.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.640
Send.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.640
Circle, message.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.680
Marina, it is too complicated
to understand why.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.200
We're nervous, too.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.520
It's a very hard moment.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.280
"#IWannaCry."

30:22.360 --> 30:25.400
Yeah, girl. Me, too. But I'm holding it.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.480
Let me think about a sentence.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.120
A catchphrase.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.520
Circle, message.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.440
The important thing is...

30:34.800 --> 30:37.400
we are strong women...

30:39.400 --> 30:42.120
and we can handle the pressure!

30:42.480 --> 30:44.040
Exclamation mark.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.360
That's it. I'm getting the hang
of this game.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.360
The spirit of the game is catchphrases.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.440
We're strong women, we're girl power...

30:52.520 --> 30:53.680
What about the game?

30:53.760 --> 30:55.520
Is Ana not afraid of getting blocked?

30:56.040 --> 30:57.160
Because Luma is.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.720
If we women were more united,

31:00.800 --> 31:03.680
things would have been so much easier.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.000
Now I just have to lay down
and wait for my death.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.200
Circle, message.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.200
Do you want to give them the news

31:19.560 --> 31:21.120
or do you want me to do it?

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
Send.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.840
ALERT!

31:27.920 --> 31:28.760
Oh, my God.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
-Alert.
-Alert.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.840
-Oh God.
-Oh, my God!

31:35.200 --> 31:36.840
I'm already alert. Let's go.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.680
Go, Duma. Give them the news.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.040
-"The influencers..."
-"...have made..."

31:44.120 --> 31:45.400
"...their decision."

31:45.480 --> 31:48.160
Yes, okay. I got it.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.600
I really hope they show me
some love and compassion.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.000
I think either one of them

31:54.080 --> 31:55.600
can save me,

31:55.680 --> 31:58.280
but I also think either one can block me.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.240
-"All players..."
-"...must go to the Circle Chat."

32:04.320 --> 32:05.320
It's time!

32:05.400 --> 32:07.520
Circle, open chat.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.400
CIRCLE CHAT

32:09.520 --> 32:11.240
Circle, message.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.560
Shit, if Dumaresq
is the one giving the news,

32:13.640 --> 32:15.960
it's because they're blocking Ray.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.280
Because if they were blocking Marina,

32:18.360 --> 32:20.560
JP would be the one telling the news.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.560
Being with a friend
while making this decision

32:24.640 --> 32:26.880
makes everything flow better.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.640
"But..." They're friends, huh?

32:28.960 --> 32:32.360
"But even so, it's extremely complicated."

32:32.440 --> 32:34.560
Dumaresq, it's really hard
to understand you

32:34.640 --> 32:36.760
because to me, you were not...

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
at all friends with JP.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.880
I don't know what happened.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.560
Wait until you're out of here
to call him friend.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.080
Circle, message.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.760
This woman is
the living proof of strength.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.800
Here, she showed us the value of love,

32:54.400 --> 32:57.440
be it self-love or love for others.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.040
Send.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.360
I love Dumaresq's messages

33:02.440 --> 33:05.040
because he always leaves
something in the air.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.640
Oh, my God. What does he mean?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.440
It's either me or Ana.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.560
Okay. I don't think it's me.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.920
Now I feel better.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.200
He didn't really say anything.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.520
Hurry, Dumaresq. For the love of God.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.720
Circle, message.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.000
Oh God, he's gonna say it.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.680
And the blocked person...

33:28.600 --> 33:29.440
is...

33:33.680 --> 33:35.440
Gosh, what a dramatic pause.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.200
I don't like it.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.840
Oh, my God.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.640
The blocked person is Ana!

34:10.480 --> 34:11.400
Ana!

34:14.400 --> 34:16.160
Ugh, this sucks!

34:21.640 --> 34:23.960
Oh, my God!

34:26.240 --> 34:29.480
They defended whoever has been
with them from the get-go.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.560
I'm a stranger to all of them.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.640
<i>Yeah, it looks like joking around</i>
<i>has its limits.</i>

34:48.560 --> 34:49.480
Got it.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.200
"Before leaving,

34:53.920 --> 34:59.360
Ana can meet one player in person."

34:59.960 --> 35:03.520
Ana, boo, I've already prepared
mimosas for us, okay?

35:04.160 --> 35:06.880
Who will it be? Who will Ana choose

35:06.960 --> 35:08.880
to talk to, huh?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.960
I don't think it'll be Luma at all.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.480
It's been a while since I had guests.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.120
Ana, my princess,
if you want to come over...

35:16.720 --> 35:18.920
you'll find dinner already served.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.920
"Ana is on her way
to one of the apartments." Hide!

35:29.720 --> 35:31.320
If I was Ana...

35:32.040 --> 35:33.480
I would visit me.

35:36.440 --> 35:40.160
Ana, please pick me.
I'm here drinking for both of us.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.720
Ana?

35:56.920 --> 35:58.720
FULL OF COLORS
EMPTY WORDS

36:00.440 --> 36:02.320
Seek knowledge.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.160
Oh, my God!

36:08.680 --> 36:12.000
I'm shook!

36:12.080 --> 36:14.280
Do the dishes.
It's the least you could've done.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.720
Won't you do them for me,
since you just got here?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.240
Oh, my God!

36:19.320 --> 36:21.080
It's so nice to meet you.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.400
I'm speechless, bitch!

36:24.480 --> 36:25.400
Tell me about it.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.160
Tell me about it... Girl!

36:28.240 --> 36:31.000
-I'm Ana. Nice to meet you.
-Why are you Ana?

36:31.080 --> 36:34.400
My name is Raf, actually.
And Ana is my best friend.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.760
-Can I sit down?
-Of course, sit.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.040
Tell me everything.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.840
-Everything?
-That's why I came.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
I felt like Ana,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.760
this character you've created
with that context of feminism,

36:46.840 --> 36:49.800
I don't think any of it was very relevant.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.800
I think that you stood out
with the humorous context.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.320
But you made a mistake
by exaggerating too much.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.040
I think your attitude
was even a little desperate.

36:58.120 --> 37:02.400
You created a group chat
right before the rating...

37:02.480 --> 37:04.040
I meant to create it before that!

37:04.120 --> 37:07.600
Yeah! And since you knew JP, Luma, and I

37:07.680 --> 37:10.880
have been influencers for a while now,

37:10.960 --> 37:13.200
what I thought was,
"Wow, she's desperate."

37:13.280 --> 37:14.800
I was obviously desperate.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.880
But then, out of nowhere,
you started telling a sad story.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.640
You also mentioned the humor,

37:20.720 --> 37:22.560
that it might have been too much.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.280
Yes, but that's what kept me in
through three eliminations.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.680
-Definitely.
-Otherwise, I would be out.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.520
You're very smart.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.280
-I wanted to have fun.
-You're quick.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.360
-I knew I wanted to do that.
-And handsome.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.960
That's what I wanted.
I made an impact in the game.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.080
Otherwise, I would have stayed
one night and then left.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.080
I didn't want that.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.240
If I were to join right now,
I'd do everything all over again.

37:44.320 --> 37:48.120
To get as far as I got was already hard
for someone joining at that point.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.600
Looks like the young gay is doing
a good job, don't you think?

37:51.680 --> 37:54.320
I think you're doing a great job.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.600
I love what you represent,
I love the things you say.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
You're a bit annoying
talking about energy.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.840
Like the others... But that's all right.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.760
Because I think you guys got

38:03.840 --> 38:06.840
that formula down with the catchphrases

38:06.920 --> 38:08.680
and the command sentences.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.800
I even said, "I'd never drink beer
with those three together."

38:12.880 --> 38:14.480
Do you think I'm like that?

38:14.560 --> 38:18.760
I'm wonderful drinking beer.
You would've paid for my beer.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.800
It's because I don't drink beer,
but the pizza is on me.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.040
Girl, give me a hug.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.000
I really wanted you to come over.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.880
I painted you with love.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.920
Obviously, I hated getting blocked,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.320
but I think they played well
by making this decision

38:32.400 --> 38:36.400
because they knew I had potential
to rise to the top, too.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.840
I was standing in their way.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.200
It was a good game. For real.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.040
You're playing well.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.120
-Should I root for you?
-Please?

38:46.400 --> 38:47.720
-Okay.
-The pizza is on me.

38:47.800 --> 38:48.720
Nice!

38:49.240 --> 38:52.480
They saved the ones
they can easily kick to the curb.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.360
With my catchphrases and empty words,

38:55.440 --> 38:58.040
I'm on my way to the final.
And where are you going, girl?

38:58.120 --> 38:59.360
You're going home.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.720
This is so sad.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.760
Alone at the bar.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.000
Classic.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.320
But it's okay.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.200
More for me.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.480
Right?

39:12.560 --> 39:14.280
And then, Ana, baby,

39:14.360 --> 39:16.720
we can settle this over
at the São Cristóvão Fair.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.560
No worries, okay?

39:19.040 --> 39:20.160
Everything's alright.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.960
Excuse me.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.760
<i>I think there's time for a last drink</i>
<i>before something else happens.</i>

39:35.040 --> 39:37.480
ALERT!

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
-Alert!
-Alert!

39:38.640 --> 39:40.120
Imagine if it's another rating.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.280
No...

39:45.680 --> 39:48.440
Oh, my God. I'm scared. What's that about?

39:49.960 --> 39:51.120
Turn it off!

39:52.000 --> 39:53.480
I don't want it anymore!

39:54.560 --> 39:55.840
That's not possible.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.360
Holy cow.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.680
I have given up hope.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.400
It's not possible.

40:08.560 --> 40:12.840
"Congratulations,
you are the finalists of <i>The Circle!"</i>

40:14.480 --> 40:16.040
No way!

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
Awesome!

40:18.920 --> 40:21.960
Whoa, nice!

40:29.160 --> 40:31.680
I'm in the final!

40:31.760 --> 40:34.640
This is so cool!

40:34.720 --> 40:36.760
Holy shit!

40:38.360 --> 40:40.200
She's a finalist, man!

40:40.280 --> 40:41.560
Road to victory!

40:44.480 --> 40:49.760
"Go to your door and get the items
that are waiting for you."

40:54.200 --> 40:58.240
Luma is a finalist!

41:00.640 --> 41:02.360
Look at this, girl!

41:02.440 --> 41:04.000
Can we open the box?

41:04.720 --> 41:07.720
Oh, there's <i>brigadeiro</i> in here!

41:11.520 --> 41:12.760
Guys, I want it!

41:12.840 --> 41:15.840
Damn, I've never seen anything so me!

41:18.960 --> 41:20.440
Luma!

41:22.240 --> 41:24.840
Hurrah, <i>The Circle!</i>

41:24.920 --> 41:27.280
A toast to myself, right, Circle?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.680
And to myself, because I deserve it!

41:43.040 --> 41:43.880
Music incoming.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.800
Party time!

42:26.920 --> 42:28.920
<i>What about the party? Is it over?</i>

42:29.600 --> 42:31.360
<i>What will we have for the after-party?</i>

42:33.680 --> 42:34.920
Here it comes!

42:35.000 --> 42:37.560
"You have received a special message."

42:38.840 --> 42:41.040
What is this about?

42:41.720 --> 42:44.560
Oh, my God. My heart is racing.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.680
Is it a video from the other players?

42:47.760 --> 42:48.640
Who could it be?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.720
They're coming over!

42:53.800 --> 42:55.960
Is it from family or from <i>The Circle?</i>

42:56.320 --> 42:58.800
I can't handle these kinds of things.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.480
<i>Hi, Lucas. Hi, Marcel.</i>

43:11.920 --> 43:13.480
<i>We miss you so much.</i>

43:13.560 --> 43:16.200
<i>We're rooting for you,</i>
<i>we know you're capable,</i>

43:16.280 --> 43:18.600
<i>and God will light your path.</i>

43:21.120 --> 43:23.320
It didn't even start, man.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.720
<i>Hey, babies. How are you?</i>

43:25.800 --> 43:27.920
<i>We miss you so, so much.</i>

43:28.320 --> 43:33.360
<i>We're waiting for you here.</i>
<i>Dad will prepare a delicious barbecue.</i>

43:33.720 --> 43:34.920
<i>Kisses.</i>

43:35.000 --> 43:37.400
<i>God bless you, okay, my loves?</i>

43:37.480 --> 43:38.880
<i>We miss you dearly.</i>

43:39.320 --> 43:41.840
<i>-Kisses.</i>
<i>-Kisses, babies.</i>

43:42.120 --> 43:45.000
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.040
It feels like we are reborn in <i>The Circle.</i>

43:52.120 --> 43:54.800
Everything we're experiencing
has to do with them.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.920
We imitate Mom, we imitate Dad.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.400
They're everything.
Everything we do, it's for them.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.360
Carol, my cousin.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.520
Oh, my God!

44:10.920 --> 44:13.160
So awesome.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.320
<i>Hey, cousin.</i>

44:15.400 --> 44:16.920
<i>I miss you, honey.</i>

44:17.760 --> 44:19.920
<i>I'm here to tell you</i>
<i>that I'm cheering you on.</i>

44:20.000 --> 44:22.120
<i>I'm sure you'll show</i>

44:22.840 --> 44:25.320
<i>that you aren't just a beautiful person</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

44:25.400 --> 44:28.360
<i>People will see your real beauty.</i>

44:28.440 --> 44:32.280
<i>I'm sure you'll come out of there</i>
<i>a lot stronger than when you went in.</i>

44:32.360 --> 44:36.280
<i>I'm here rooting for you.</i>
<i>I love you. We're together, always.</i>

44:36.360 --> 44:38.240
<i>All the best for you.</i>

44:38.560 --> 44:39.440
<i>Big kiss.</i>

44:39.520 --> 44:41.000
<i>From your cousin, who loves you.</i>

44:43.880 --> 44:45.600
Oh, my God!

44:51.480 --> 44:52.840
Beautiful message. Thank you.

44:53.320 --> 44:54.920
Thank you.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.720
<i>It's your mom here. I'm rooting for you.</i>

45:03.800 --> 45:06.160
My mom!

45:07.760 --> 45:10.640
<i>What I want from you is strength, courage,</i>

45:10.720 --> 45:13.840
<i>everything... grit...</i>
<i>Everything you love to do the most.</i>

45:13.920 --> 45:15.480
<i>Go after your goal.</i>

45:15.560 --> 45:17.840
<i>I know you can. You can do it.</i>

45:17.920 --> 45:20.640
<i>Show them who you are,</i>
<i>the strength you have.</i>

45:20.720 --> 45:22.600
<i>It's all that I wish for you.</i>

45:22.680 --> 45:24.360
<i>From your mom, who loves you so much.</i>

45:24.440 --> 45:28.040
Best mother in the world.
I love you. I miss you very much.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.480
I am only here for you, man!

45:36.800 --> 45:39.040
Oh, my God!

45:42.000 --> 45:43.320
It's my sister.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.960
<i>Hi, Rafa, baby!</i>

45:45.040 --> 45:47.440
<i>We're here praying, cheering.</i>

45:47.800 --> 45:50.840
<i>Despite our misunderstandings</i>
<i>here at home,</i>

45:51.480 --> 45:54.520
<i>we are proud of you</i>
<i>for always being positive</i>

45:54.600 --> 45:56.000
<i>in every situation.</i>

45:56.080 --> 45:59.400
<i>And your biggest fan</i>
<i>is high up there. Mommy.</i>

45:59.480 --> 46:02.400
<i>I'm sure she's watching, super happy.</i>

46:02.480 --> 46:05.760
<i>Keep the focus, keep being positive.</i>
<i>Everything's going to work out.</i>

46:05.840 --> 46:08.440
<i>I love you. Kisses.</i>

46:11.720 --> 46:13.400
She's my older sister.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.040
We grew up together.

46:16.400 --> 46:20.400
And four years ago, my mother passed away.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.480
It was, no doubt,
the hardest moment of our lives

46:24.560 --> 46:26.160
that we had to face...

46:27.280 --> 46:28.360
together.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.480
<i>Hi, my beautiful daughter.</i>

46:48.760 --> 46:51.280
It's my mommy!

46:51.360 --> 46:54.960
<i>Honey, look where you are right now.</i>

46:55.040 --> 46:57.280
<i>And you're not there for nothing.</i>

46:57.360 --> 47:00.200
<i>You're right where you wanted to be.</i>

47:00.280 --> 47:01.240
<i>That's nice, dear.</i>

47:01.320 --> 47:03.200
<i>I'm really happy for you.</i>

47:04.360 --> 47:08.040
<i>My heart is breaking a little.</i>
<i>I really miss you.</i>

47:08.400 --> 47:11.040
<i>But Mommy is really glad</i>
<i>that you're there,</i>

47:11.120 --> 47:12.600
<i>right where you wanted to be.</i>

47:13.240 --> 47:14.720
<i>A big kiss.</i>

47:15.720 --> 47:17.640
Oh, mom!

47:19.320 --> 47:21.680
Nothing better than a mother's affection.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.680
I missed that.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.200
Circle, I want to tell you something.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.440
I'm very happy. Very happy indeed.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.600
Now I have to focus on winning.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.640
Luma is truth,

47:35.000 --> 47:36.520
Luma is energy...

47:36.600 --> 47:39.840
Luma is Lucas's stories,
Marcel's stories...

47:39.920 --> 47:41.760
Luma is, in short,

47:41.840 --> 47:44.760
the best that Marcel and I
can do together.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.840
I'm here as my real self,

47:47.160 --> 47:48.320
in my essence.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.040
I don't regret anything.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.840
I would do it all over again.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.480
Now my goal is to take...

47:55.960 --> 47:57.880
the prize.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.840
I won't get out of here...

48:01.400 --> 48:03.080
And no one can get you out of there!

48:03.160 --> 48:04.760
And no one can get me out of here.

48:05.080 --> 48:06.120
Thank you so much.
