14:11.851 --> 14:14.895
But Cialis or Viagra, sometimes both...

14:15.479 --> 14:18.399
Doc Ron here, he's my pusher.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.277
If you ever need a hard-on,
this is my card.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.073
[men laugh]

14:27.199 --> 14:29.118
Thank you. Thank you so much, Ron.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.079
Get about a 10-, 15-minute semi.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.789
I'm okay with a semi.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.249
Can you still come?

14:35.457 --> 14:36.876
- Can you still...
- Yes.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.669
Excuse me - orgasm. Yeah?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.754
If you count... dust.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.716
That's terrible!

14:43.799 --> 14:46.343
The last time that my wife got frisky,

14:46.969 --> 14:52.349
we were in bed and she starts
stroking my chest and my stomach

14:52.433 --> 14:55.728
and she slid her hand lower under my ass

14:56.103 --> 14:58.105
and, all of a sudden, she stops

14:58.480 --> 15:00.482
and I'm like, "Why are you stopping?"

15:00.816 --> 15:03.569
And she says, "I found the remote."

15:15.831 --> 15:17.207
You guys hear about Katz?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.752
- Murray Katz?
- Stroke.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.922
Yeah, they ran him down
to Cedars this morning.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.883
- How is he?
- I'm gonna guess... not good.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.552
- And Darlene Lipshaw.
- The tango dancer?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.512
She's a good dancer.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.764
Well, she <i>was.</i>

15:32.014 --> 15:33.933
Fell in the shower, broke her hip.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.559
Anything else?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.811
- And her nose.
- [groans]

15:38.145 --> 15:41.273
Well, I want to thank you
for bringing us the good news.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.867
That was Johnny Sunshine.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.638
Not good.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.600
[Sunshine] Hear about Saul Fischer?
He won $5 at canasta,

16:58.976 --> 17:01.228
went to bed, woke up dead.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.188
Marty Freeman had a knee replacement.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.108
And then they found a tumor on his spine.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.233
That it?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.819
That's not enough for you?

18:04.458 --> 18:08.087
You know, I don’t think I ever knew
that you play the piano.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.219
I'm not there yet, Buddy.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.564
It's... a new season.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.858
Embrace it.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.121
George Burns. He was 100 years old.
He never retired.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.833
Rickles. He couldn’t walk,
but he was still killing ’em.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.127
I'd rather go down working.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.629
[chuckles]

18:51.713 --> 18:52.881
You're not working.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.225
Do you have any idea how hot
old comedians are right now?

19:03.559 --> 19:04.559
What?

19:05.727 --> 19:07.521
There’s a lot of love for the old-timers.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.569
- Are you smoking grass?
- Mmhmm.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.364
- I have a card.
- Since when do you smoke pot?

19:19.366 --> 19:22.536
Since 1965, when The Beatles started.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.955
A pot-smoking podiatrist.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.836
- Want some?
- Not my thing.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.880
You never tried it, did you?

19:36.341 --> 19:38.135
Of course I've tried it!

19:39.386 --> 19:41.226
- It's just not my thing.
- You never tried it.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.639
- I tried it.
- You never tried it.

19:43.932 --> 19:47.394
Oh, God,
you're the most tragically unhip person.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.814
- Like you're hip!
- I am. I am pretty hip.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.150
Hip people do not say they're hip.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.617
And just because I don't act
like a jazz musician doesn't mean I'm not.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.280
Jazz musician?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.532
That's your frame of reference?

20:01.867 --> 20:05.412
That is the most unhip statement
I have ever heard.

20:07.748 --> 20:12.169
Look... can we just talk about this,
just hypothetically?

20:13.462 --> 20:14.755
Talk about what?

20:17.257 --> 20:19.635
Are you telling me you don't miss it?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.179
You could have been big.

20:22.888 --> 20:23.888
I am big.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.849
It's the jokes that got small.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.352
You see? That's funny.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.481
I'm a funny guy, you know?
I used to crack up my patients.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.360
- You had a gift.
- I was just another comic.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.778
I barely had an act.

20:38.028 --> 20:41.365
You... had a personality and you still do.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.659
And, by the way, you're in great shape.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.580
I retired, Al, 50 years ago!

20:48.664 --> 20:50.916
What a great comeback story!

20:50.999 --> 20:54.086
Yeah, from bunions to Broadway!

20:55.045 --> 20:58.840
See, you just can't help but be funny.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.425
I'm a funny guy, okay!

21:00.509 --> 21:04.263
Why not let me get you a few gigs?
Just a few, test the waters.

21:05.222 --> 21:08.392
Because I'm not a comedian, Al.
I'm not!

21:08.976 --> 21:09.977
Not any more.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.853
Come on, what do you have to lose?

21:14.064 --> 21:15.774
Buddy?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.821
Go slip her that mushy semi.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.739
[Buddy laughs]

21:39.756 --> 21:41.758
[man] Oh, boy, here we go!

21:41.883 --> 21:44.428
Here comes the Doomsday report.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.305
- Did you hear about Buddy?
- Huh?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.140
Did you hear about Buddy?

21:48.307 --> 21:51.393
- How is he?
- Not good.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.498
Jesus, Buddy.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.378
Her name was Gayle Johnson and...

22:19.546 --> 22:21.006
she was wonderful.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.135
We fell asleep watching <i>Law and Order.</i>

22:28.555 --> 22:29.931
She never woke up.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.936
I am so sorry.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.856
Couldn't take losing
another woman I loved.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.525
So...

22:42.194 --> 22:44.196
I pretended I didn't love her.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.077
Would it have killed me
to say that I loved her?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.038
I'm sure she knew.

22:53.163 --> 22:57.209
She was the only thing
that made this place... bearable.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.752
That's not true.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.253
You love it here.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.338
I hate it.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.592
What about all the shows...

23:05.675 --> 23:08.345
Tone deaf singers and puppet shows.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.768
I'm really not ready to die.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.978
You're not gonna die.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.277
Let's do it.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.031
Just like in the old days.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.284
Let's get out of here and put me to work.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.082
Are you serious?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.503
I'm serious as cancer.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.901
I'm gonna book you in Vegas.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.446
We'll play Chicago and New York and...

24:08.280 --> 24:11.867
Buddy, I'm gonna book you
on the fucking Tonight Show.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.092
I got doughnuts and coffee.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.336
- Did you tell your son?
- You call your granddaughter?

24:35.182 --> 24:36.433
Okay, hit it!

24:44.733 --> 24:47.068
$10 they won’t make it to Glendale.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.626
So, do you even have an act?

25:03.668 --> 25:04.878
I never had an act.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.963
I got 50 years of jokes.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.226
Uhh.. Woah... You missed the exit!

25:20.143 --> 25:21.853
Aren't we going to Vegas?

25:22.312 --> 25:25.440
- Practically.
- What do you mean, "practically"?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.276
Vegas is oversaturated.
I got us something better.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.030
You couldn't book me in Vegas.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.532
Of course I could.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.951
It's your first gig in a long time.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.828
Let's stay under the radar
while you get your chops back.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.206
So, where am I playing?

25:41.581 --> 25:42.958
It's a little off-Strip.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.710
Look at that - practically Vegas.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.338
You are out of your mind.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.133
Oh, I need some mascara.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.093
What?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.096
You know, some mascara.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.642
Hi there. We're playing the Kickapoo Room.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.894
Do I check in here?

26:03.061 --> 26:06.481
Kickapoo Room? That's at the Palace,
about a mile down the road.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.681
- It's about a mile...
- I heard.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.613
It's called paying your dues.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.533
[comedian] <i>Am I the only one
that gets a rush of adrenaline</i>

26:16.616 --> 26:19.536
when the radio DJ cuts his dismount

26:19.619 --> 26:22.080
a little too close
to the song's beginning?

26:22.163 --> 26:24.833
"You're listening to 90.1 The Patch

26:24.916 --> 26:27.794
and we're having
such a smooth time here today."

26:27.877 --> 26:29.796
You gotta get out of there, Mike!

26:29.879 --> 26:33.008
Tracey Chapman's nipping at your heels,
buddy!

26:33.258 --> 26:34.634
Show us your tits, sweetie.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.973
I went to theater school
and I caught the bug in high school

26:40.056 --> 26:42.809
and by "the bug,"
I mean narcissistic personality disorder.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.894
- But...
- No, you mean AIDS.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.730
Oh, for the love of God!

26:47.355 --> 26:49.649
I bet you can fit that microphone
in your mouth, boy.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.485
- You nervous?
- No!

26:52.569 --> 26:54.946
What have I got to be nervous about?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.366
- Hey, I found mascara.
- Oh, that's great!

26:58.450 --> 26:59.451
Great!

27:00.535 --> 27:01.535
What's it for?

27:02.120 --> 27:04.122
I told you - don't ask.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.001
I don't think I can connect with you.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.754
I think in order to connect,
I'd have to unread a lot of things.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.468
All right! Well, I'm gonna go
wade into a river Virginia Woolf-style.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.054
Good luck at your next book burning, sir.
Thank you so much.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.555
I've been Paula Poundstone.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.400
Have a great night and give it up
for your next poor son of a bitch...

27:23.642 --> 27:25.769
Buddy Green!

27:27.729 --> 27:30.440
It’s not worth it.
Just get in your car and keep driving.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.210
Thank you.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.422
Oh, wow!

27:55.006 --> 27:57.008
[Buddy laughs]

27:57.717 --> 27:58.968
Okay.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.055
Here's the deal.

28:02.138 --> 28:06.267
I have not been on a stage in about...

28:07.394 --> 28:09.396
50 years.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.023
No joke!

28:13.066 --> 28:15.527
I used to do this for a living

28:15.610 --> 28:19.531
and I just decided to come back
and do it for the laughs.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.864
No one's laughing!

28:27.747 --> 28:31.418
Okay.
So, I've been getting into online dating

28:32.419 --> 28:38.425
and I actually found
a really nice gal online...

28:39.467 --> 28:40.802
at the Souplantation.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.058
'Cause old people like to eat soup.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.768
Ha Ha.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.776
I am getting old.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.319
[man] So is your act.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.990
It was nice of the meth lab
to let you out to see the show.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.036
And, by the way, nice mullet.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.040
Who does your hair? NASCAR?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.713
All right, I should leave him alone.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.924
Poor guy hasn't gotten laid
since he made parole.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.135
[audience laughs]

29:22.886 --> 29:26.639
And I can talk.
I haven't had sex since Watergate.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.267
I'm just kidding.

29:29.726 --> 29:30.977
My wife loved sex, though.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.773
Her favorite position
was the missionary position.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.609
That's where she's in bed, on her back

29:37.984 --> 29:39.068
and I'm in Africa.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.539
You were a hit!

29:53.208 --> 29:54.876
I pummeled at the Palace.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.086
I was the Rickles of the reservation.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.963
This is great. You know,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.382
we're cutting our teeth
on these little podunk towns,

30:01.466 --> 30:03.343
but by the time we get to New York City,

30:03.802 --> 30:04.928
you're gonna be in top form.

30:05.011 --> 30:08.598
Hey, have you heard
from Carson's people yet?

30:08.681 --> 30:10.725
Buddy, you're two hosts behind.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.479
- Fallon.
- We're trading calls.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.981
It's Vic Lardo.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.558
He used to book for Letterman.

30:20.151 --> 30:24.614
An old friend. He owes me big-time,
you know, so...

30:25.240 --> 30:27.826
Anyway, they know the situation
and they're interested.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.285
Beyond interested.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.873
Just trying to figure out the dates.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.835
Boy, that would be great.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.716
You're a real pothead, aren't you?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.676
It's medicine.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.971
It helps me relax.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.600
So, where in San Diego are we playing?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.896
It's a little south of the city.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.690
A great club.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.652
You call your granddaughter?

31:04.821 --> 31:06.781
No, I'll call her tomorrow. I'm tired.

31:07.615 --> 31:08.616
You call your son?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.743
No, not yet.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.955
I'll call him tomorrow. I'm too tired.

31:17.917 --> 31:18.917
Hey, Al?

31:19.586 --> 31:20.628
Yeah, Buddy?

31:23.214 --> 31:24.214
Thanks.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.766
It's what I do.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.235
[Buddy] You know, I met Arty Wise once
in the Catskills.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.945
He gave me a compliment.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.363
[Al] He liked your act?

31:47.447 --> 31:48.615
No, he liked my suit.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.992
He didn't say anything about my act!

31:52.619 --> 31:55.371
Oh, man. He was my last client.

31:56.789 --> 32:00.293
He retired at the peak of his career.
You know, I still get calls for him.

32:00.668 --> 32:03.755
Oh, that must have really pissed you off
when he retired.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.965
Ah, not at all, really.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.469
You know what your problem is?

32:09.761 --> 32:15.016
- Never trust a guy who starts with that.
- You are filled with resentment.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.142
All built-up...

32:16.225 --> 32:18.728
I am being psychoanalyzed
by a foot doctor.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.649
Like one of those cans of peanut brittle
with the snakes all scrunched up inside.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.692
Someone comes up
and asks for some peanut brittle,

32:24.817 --> 32:27.695
and they open it up
and Al snakes everywhere.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.156
I don’t know
what the fuck you’re talking about.

32:32.575 --> 32:33.576
Anyway...

32:34.535 --> 32:36.913
you ever notice how old people eat,
you know?

32:36.996 --> 32:37.996
No.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.125
No, wait, it's more like this.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.921
That's exactly...
That's right. It's like this.

32:56.933 --> 32:57.933
Hello!

33:00.853 --> 33:04.691
[Buddy] You know,
we passed San Diego 20 minutes ago.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.109
Where is this club?

33:06.192 --> 33:07.652
Just a little south of here.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.621
[Buddy] This is Tijuana.

33:18.871 --> 33:19.872
[Al] It's a tourist town.

33:19.956 --> 33:23.459
- It's Tijuana!
- You don't think they have nightclubs?

33:23.543 --> 33:25.628
I know they have nightclubs in Tijuana!

33:25.712 --> 33:29.799
I saw a broad fuck a <i>burro</i> once
in a nightclub in Tijuana.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.969
There's no <i>burro </i> fucking in this,
I promise.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.469
It's legit, seriously.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.473
Legit! Do you read a newspaper?

33:37.557 --> 33:40.018
Tijuana is practically
a suburb of San Diego.

33:41.185 --> 33:44.105
My son lives in the suburbs, okay?

33:44.188 --> 33:46.774
In the suburbs, they have Olive Gardens!

34:07.170 --> 34:09.297
Thank you. It's great to be here.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.924
[interprets to Spanish]

34:13.342 --> 34:18.181
I actually live
in the Los Angeles section of Mexico.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.649
He got that laugh.
I didn't get that laugh. Wait a minute.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.987
All right, listen, thank you very much.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.906
I think I can do this by myself.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.364
Okay? I appreciate it.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.331
See? We understand each other.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.792
We have a lot in common.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.128
I grew up in a bad neighborhood, too.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.759
South side of Chicago.
Very tough neighborhood.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.511
But like Tijuana,

34:56.803 --> 34:59.222
it's a really wonderful place
to grow up...

34:59.847 --> 35:00.847
if you're a bullet.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.854
Things are getting pretty bad
for you guys up in the States.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.441
<i>I smoke marijuana
and my dealer is Mexican.</i>

35:10.525 --> 35:13.361
<i>I called him the other day
and he brought a couple of ounces of weed</i>

35:13.444 --> 35:16.489
<i>and I asked him if he had any papers
and he ran away!</i>

35:16.656 --> 35:18.658
[audience laughs and applauds]

35:22.245 --> 35:23.245
You did it again!

35:24.330 --> 35:26.499
In Tijuana! Who'd-a-thunk?

35:26.582 --> 35:28.292
I know! It's like...

35:29.544 --> 35:30.878
Hey, Americans!

35:31.337 --> 35:35.424
Hey, where do you go
to have a good time in this town?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.679
[Al] Don't we get a telephone call?

35:43.891 --> 35:47.436
[Al speaking Spanish]

35:49.272 --> 35:51.023
We've got a sick man here.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.025
How are you doing, Buddy?

35:53.818 --> 35:56.571
You never drink the water.
Everyone knows that.

35:58.739 --> 35:59.739
What?

35:59.782 --> 36:01.117
<i>Soborno.</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:03.161
What's <i>soborno?</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:04.327
Bribe.

36:05.788 --> 36:06.788
Nationality?

36:08.583 --> 36:09.792
What do you think?

36:16.757 --> 36:18.509
[water running]

36:51.918 --> 36:53.002
You drink the Pepto?

36:54.253 --> 36:55.796
Yeah.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.880
That's good.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.424
I just need sleep.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.593
You'll sleep well tonight in Tucson.

37:02.845 --> 37:03.846
You can do it.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.390
Okay.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.144
- Okay.
- Great.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.563
Let's ride!

37:31.499 --> 37:33.834
[woman] <i> All the way from Los Angeles,</i>

37:33.918 --> 37:37.004
let's give a big hand for Buddy Green!

37:38.214 --> 37:40.216
[audience cheers]

37:42.468 --> 37:43.468
Hi.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.180
Well, there go my Asian jokes.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.934
But I'm gonna tell you,
I don't like ethnic jokes.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.311
I really don't. Now, there is a fine line.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.189
For instance, when I first came up here,
I'll tell you,

37:55.356 --> 37:57.024
and I don't think this is racist,

37:57.650 --> 37:59.568
when I first came up here,
I looked out at you

37:59.652 --> 38:00.695
and I got a little hungry.

38:33.352 --> 38:36.063
[Al]Vic! Calling you from sunny Tucson.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.649
Yeah, beautiful town.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.861
Oh, yeah,
they’re taking great care of us.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.070
Beautiful hotels!

38:46.032 --> 38:48.034
Yeah, slowly but surely.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.703
We'll be in Chicago by next Friday.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.207
Oh, the response has been terrific.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.711
Well, I mean, it's a great story.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.504
You'd be crazy not to jump on it.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.633
Oh, I really appreciate it, Vic.
I'm gonna owe you big-time.

39:06.677 --> 39:11.515
Oh, so we're looking at
about another ten days on the road.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.979
Sure. Are you kidding?
Those dates would be perfect.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.025
Did you talk to Fallon directly?

39:22.860 --> 39:23.860
Oh.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.780
No, of course not, yeah.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.158
But you told them the whole story,
right?

39:30.993 --> 39:32.536
Well, they've got to be moved.

39:34.163 --> 39:37.083
Yeah. Yes, it's a hell of a story, Vic.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.945
- What?
- Oh, no!

40:06.028 --> 40:07.028
What...

40:07.071 --> 40:08.071
Holy shit!

40:08.406 --> 40:09.532
What did you do?

40:09.615 --> 40:10.866
Doing this stuff again!

40:13.202 --> 40:14.202
Oh, God!

40:14.870 --> 40:15.870
I... You...

40:17.873 --> 40:19.834
It's okay. They're gonna... There he goes.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.420
- We're good.
- [Buddy groans]

40:22.586 --> 40:25.506
You just threw away an ounce
of top-shelf indica.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.700
Hey!

40:53.325 --> 40:54.952
What? What happened?

40:56.036 --> 40:57.037
You fell asleep.

40:59.623 --> 41:00.624
What time is it?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.883
Let me ask you a question.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.179
Is it gonna be like this
all the way to New York?

41:13.262 --> 41:14.930
Because I need some rest.

41:15.222 --> 41:17.057
Okay. We have Lubbock tonight,

41:17.141 --> 41:19.226
and then you’ll have the whole day
to rest in Kansas.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.062
Ooh, a whole day! Ooh, in Kansas!

41:23.230 --> 41:25.649
You know,
you've been very irritable since Tijuana.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.487
[Buddy] It's one state over!

41:29.570 --> 41:31.197
[Al] It's completely out of the way.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.450
Now, I can't score weed in Texas.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.994
It's a police state.
I gotta go to Colorado.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.788
Willie Nelson doesn't have a problem
scoring in Texas.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.207
Willie Nelson gets a day off!

41:41.290 --> 41:43.292
Willie Nelson tours all the time.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.585
I've got news for you.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.086
This is not a tour.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.088
This is a death march.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.300
- I need my weed, Al.
- Okay!

41:51.842 --> 41:53.552
I will buy pot for you.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.138
I will buy you a brick of Maui Whoopee.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.643
Would you just stop eating
those fucking potato chips?

42:02.102 --> 42:03.229
Thank you, Al.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.942
[man] <i>All right, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

42:08.025 --> 42:12.863
This next comic has got me all excited.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.616
So, let's give
a great big old Lubbock, Texas welcome

42:15.741 --> 42:18.536
for Mr Buddy Greenberg!

42:19.328 --> 42:20.621
Show 'em what you got!

42:22.957 --> 42:24.959
It's Buddy Green.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.627
Drop the "berg."

42:34.927 --> 42:36.011
Evening, fellas!

42:36.262 --> 42:37.471
You boys from around here?

42:38.055 --> 42:39.723
Al Hart, from Los Angeles.

42:40.307 --> 42:43.310
Would any of you gentlemen know
where I could procure...

42:43.644 --> 42:46.564
you know, a small amount of marijuana?

42:46.647 --> 42:49.066
[Buddy] <i>The last time that I was in Texas,</i>

42:49.149 --> 42:53.320
the men brought their horses
in and left their wives tied up outside.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.458
Hey! What's up?

43:07.835 --> 43:08.669
How's it hanging?

43:08.752 --> 43:12.423
Listen,
you look like some pretty cool dudes.

43:12.506 --> 43:16.927
I'm just looking to score
a little bit of Mary Jane,

43:17.011 --> 43:18.470
you know, some wacky weed.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.180
Pot.

43:21.473 --> 43:22.473
Well?

43:23.726 --> 43:24.726
And stay in school!

43:25.394 --> 43:27.271
[Buddy] <i>I think Texas gets a bad rap.</i>

43:27.563 --> 43:29.398
I'm always defending Texas.

43:29.481 --> 43:34.570
I mean, I don"t think that you guys
would just execute any black person.

44:04.475 --> 44:09.271
Did you hear about the cowboy
who wore brown paper bags for clothing?

44:09.855 --> 44:11.440
He got picked up for rustling.

44:22.534 --> 44:25.245
- Maybe this'll cheer you up.
- Oww.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.664
- What?
- Sorry.

44:27.414 --> 44:28.707
Are you kidding?

44:30.626 --> 44:32.294
Where'd you get this?

44:33.712 --> 44:35.798
I got it from a jazz musician.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.133
Yeah, right!

44:39.968 --> 44:40.968
Thanks.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.429
- Thanks, man.
- Wait a minute.

44:43.389 --> 44:44.389
It's Jeannie.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.640
Your granddaughter.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.770
- What do I do?
- Answer it.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.314
Isn't it a little late?

44:52.398 --> 44:54.483
It's true. That's true. It's very late.

44:54.566 --> 44:57.027
- It's too late to be calling.
- What if it's an emergency?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.738
You're the only emergency possible
and you're alive.

44:59.822 --> 45:01.824
Yep. She can leave a message.

45:02.908 --> 45:05.661
Well, I got a good feeling about Kansas.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.291
Hey, Buddy... I never asked you.

45:13.627 --> 45:14.753
Why did you quit?

45:17.548 --> 45:18.548
Well...

45:19.550 --> 45:20.968
I had a house in the Hills.

45:21.927 --> 45:25.097
I had a swimming pool.
I had a brand-new Jaguar every two years.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.808
I had a wife, who gave me a son,

45:28.392 --> 45:30.185
who gave me three grandchildren.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.856
So, what the fuck did I quit?

46:40.839 --> 46:45.594
<i>"There were only three things standing
between me and Yasgur's Farm that summer.</i>

46:45.677 --> 46:48.806
<i>Two of those hurdles
were not having a car or money.</i>

46:49.389 --> 46:53.310
<i>That wouldn’t stop me
from seeing Janis Joplin at Woodstock.</i>

46:53.393 --> 46:57.272
<i>It was the third obstacle
that was the most difficult.</i>

46:58.190 --> 46:59.483
<i>I was 12.</i>

47:01.151 --> 47:03.529
So, this girl from Overland Park

47:03.612 --> 47:05.823
did what any typical seventh grader
would do.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.282
She tried to hitchhike.

47:07.366 --> 47:11.119
My thumb was out no more than five minutes
before the car pulled up,

47:11.203 --> 47:15.123
which was a 1965 Buick Special.

47:15.207 --> 47:20.170
Coincidentally, the same car
that my father drove,

47:20.254 --> 47:24.633
which wasn't really a coincidence
because it was my father.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.428
I never made it to Woodstock

47:28.512 --> 47:32.474
and I spent those last days of summer
locked in my bedroom,

47:32.891 --> 47:37.145
dreaming of Janis,
who would be dead the following year."

47:38.981 --> 47:40.983
Well, that's the end of the chapter.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.152
Thank you.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.413
Oh, thank you!

48:00.544 --> 48:03.672
Oh, that's so sweet! Thank you.

48:19.479 --> 48:21.023
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:21.106 --> 48:23.150
- MInd if I...
- Please.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.074
I liked your reading.

48:31.158 --> 48:35.287
Oh, thanks. It's a work in progress,
like my life.

48:36.622 --> 48:39.291
I'm Al, by the way.
Al Hart from Los Angeles.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.919
- Doris Lovejoy from...
- Overland Park?

48:42.002 --> 48:43.211
- Yeah!
- Lovejoy...

48:43.295 --> 48:45.297
Lovejoy - is that your stage name?

48:46.006 --> 48:47.758
No. I'm an eighth Pawnee.

48:47.841 --> 48:49.801
- Oh, the Pawnee Lovejoys.
- Yeah!

48:51.136 --> 48:55.015
So, Al Hart from Los Angeles,
what brings you to Kansas City?

48:55.557 --> 48:56.808
I'm on tour.

48:57.643 --> 48:59.853
I knew you were a rock star.

49:00.437 --> 49:02.147
More like Elvis's grandfather.

49:08.195 --> 49:11.031
Say, I'm not usually this forward.

49:12.032 --> 49:14.618
Doris, would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow?

49:15.577 --> 49:18.038
I don't know, Al. That is just so forward.

49:18.747 --> 49:19.747
You're right.

49:20.290 --> 49:22.376
How about... just soup?

49:27.631 --> 49:28.966
So, do you want my number?

49:29.466 --> 49:31.718
<i>You can have more time
to practice your putting</i>

49:31.802 --> 49:35.305
<i>with the Potty Putter,
the amazing new toilet time golf game</i>

49:35.389 --> 49:38.183
<i>that lets you practice your putting...
on the potty!</i>

49:38.350 --> 49:40.852
<i>Your Potty Putter
comes with its own putting green,</i>

49:40.978 --> 49:44.398
<i>made of the same professional carpet
found at miniature golf courses.</i>

49:44.481 --> 49:48.193
<i>Now, practice your putting every time
you take care of your other business.</i>

49:48.318 --> 49:51.655
<i>Just aim and shoot the ball into the cup.</i>

49:51.863 --> 49:56.576
<i>Just think of all that extra practice,
all only 19.99.</i>

49:56.660 --> 49:59.705
<i>Let your imagination soar
with a Potty Putter.</i>

50:00.539 --> 50:01.832
<i>Don't touch that dial!</i>

50:02.374 --> 50:06.003
<i>Coming up next, the champagne sounds
of The Lawrence Welk Show.</i>

50:06.128 --> 50:09.297
<i>And now, here's your host, Lawrence Welk.</i>

50:11.258 --> 50:13.135
[Doris] Arty Wise?

50:13.218 --> 50:17.097
I adore him!
I used to watch him on Ed Sullivan.

50:17.305 --> 50:19.683
I even went to Vegas to see him once.

50:20.600 --> 50:23.895
Those are my racist family relics.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.398
I painted my family heirlooms.

50:27.232 --> 50:29.484
So, what was he like?

50:30.193 --> 50:31.193
Arty?

50:32.195 --> 50:33.195
He was a mensch.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.033
Stayed with me to the end.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.585
<i>You've reached Al Hart
at Al Hart Management.</i>

50:46.668 --> 50:49.880
<i>Please leave a message at the beep
and we'll get right back to you.</i>

50:55.302 --> 50:58.513
So, what about you?
What were you doing back in the day?

50:58.722 --> 51:03.351
I was probably booking Pat Henry
for Sinatra at the Fontainebleu.

51:03.477 --> 51:04.311
Wow!

51:04.394 --> 51:05.812
You are so hip.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.274
To be honest, I never even smoked pot.

51:09.357 --> 51:10.776
How is that even possible?

51:11.443 --> 51:13.153
I don't like to lose control.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.239
All right, take a hit. There you go.
Oh, wow!

51:16.323 --> 51:18.283
That's it, okay. Hold it in.

51:18.366 --> 51:19.366
[blows]

51:20.535 --> 51:22.370
That was a good hit!

51:22.454 --> 51:24.289
I might as well suck on a muffler.

51:24.664 --> 51:26.958
One more like that
and you'll be good to go.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.252
Here you go.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.837
That's good. Wonderful...

51:32.047 --> 51:34.966
Oh, my God.
I know someone who's gonna love you.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.887
[Doris] I was an art teacher
before I retired.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.932
I used to paint, but now I do these.

51:43.975 --> 51:45.018
[Al] They're magnificent.

51:45.852 --> 51:46.852
Thank you.

51:47.437 --> 51:48.438
No, really.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.067
These are like... Rodin meets Larry Flynt.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.236
[Doris laughs]

51:54.444 --> 51:57.864
I just think it's wonderful
that you guys are doing this.

51:58.156 --> 52:01.076
It must be so exciting
to be back on the road again.

52:02.619 --> 52:06.373
But why did he quit
right before Ed Sullivan?

52:06.748 --> 52:09.042
You would think
he'd want to go out with a bang.

52:10.585 --> 52:11.837
That's a good question.

52:12.295 --> 52:13.295
I don't know.

52:13.755 --> 52:16.299
See what happens when you lose control?

52:17.300 --> 52:19.970
Hey, where are you?

52:20.220 --> 52:21.471
We're supposed to have dinner.

52:21.763 --> 52:22.848
<i>Listen, Buddy,</i>

52:22.931 --> 52:25.308
you mind eating on your own tonight?

52:26.852 --> 52:28.562
Why? What's going on?

52:28.728 --> 52:31.189
<i>It's a long story.</i>

52:31.773 --> 52:33.024
I kind of met someone.

52:33.733 --> 52:34.943
It's crazy!

52:35.026 --> 52:36.111
Hold on.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.238
[woman moaning]

52:39.698 --> 52:40.532
She came.

52:40.615 --> 52:41.950
I'll explain later.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.744
Maybe you can just order from room service
or something. What do you think?

52:45.787 --> 52:49.541
Sure. I'll have them send up a filet
and a crack pipe.

53:14.941 --> 53:18.820
- I'm feeling a little strange, Doris.
- Yeah.

53:20.530 --> 53:21.907
How y'all doing tonight?

53:28.205 --> 53:29.915
[Al] Ah, I'm stuffed.

53:33.043 --> 53:34.961
I love barbecue.

53:35.837 --> 53:37.339
Look at the stars.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.383
Oh, wow!

53:40.675 --> 53:42.219
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.805
Sometimes in special moments,

53:46.139 --> 53:50.060
I just like to feel the ground.
You should try it.

53:52.187 --> 53:54.564
I never take my shoes off on a first date.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.608
Is this a date?

53:57.484 --> 53:58.485
I don't know.

53:59.569 --> 54:00.737
- Well...
- Is it?

54:00.820 --> 54:03.990
Whatever it is,
it's a pretty special moment.

54:04.699 --> 54:05.784
Don't you think?

54:09.621 --> 54:10.621
Yeah.

54:38.858 --> 54:39.859
That's very nice.

54:56.126 --> 54:56.960
Where am I?

54:57.127 --> 54:58.712
[audience laughs]

54:59.004 --> 55:00.255
Oh, you find that funny?

55:00.714 --> 55:03.800
An old man is lost
and you find that funny?

55:08.096 --> 55:09.222
I discovered him.

55:11.474 --> 55:12.474
Twice.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.762
[Al and Buddy singing]

56:00.732 --> 56:01.732
Okay!

56:22.170 --> 56:24.923
So, what's your plan?

56:25.840 --> 56:27.342
Or are you winging it?

56:27.842 --> 56:28.842
What do you mean?

56:29.427 --> 56:30.762
I mean the girl.

56:31.846 --> 56:32.889
What are you doing?

56:33.765 --> 56:34.765
I don't know.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.436
In all my years,
I've never picked up a girl on the road.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.980
Is she gonna go all the way
to New York with us?

56:41.606 --> 56:42.690
Would you mind if she did?

56:42.774 --> 56:45.026
I don't mind. It's your life.

56:45.110 --> 56:46.110
You see?

56:46.861 --> 56:47.861
You do mind.

56:47.904 --> 56:50.784
There are just certain things
I might have wanted to talk to you about...

56:50.865 --> 56:51.950
What certain things?

56:52.117 --> 56:54.702
Stuff to... talk about.

56:55.286 --> 56:56.287
So, we talk.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.958
Forget it. To hell with me!

57:00.250 --> 57:05.338
Okay, Slim Jims, Cheetos,
pork rinds, cookies!

57:06.673 --> 57:07.673
Hello.

57:08.174 --> 57:09.174
Hi!

57:11.261 --> 57:12.261
Hi!

57:32.282 --> 57:33.825
That's the Palmer House.

57:33.908 --> 57:35.493
I booked you in the Empire Room.

57:35.577 --> 57:37.871
- Remember you were opening for Al Hirt?
- Bobby Hackett.

57:37.954 --> 57:39.247
Bullshit!

57:42.709 --> 57:44.127
Mister Kelly's was right there.

57:44.210 --> 57:46.129
You played on a bill
with Barbra Streisand.

57:46.212 --> 57:47.755
She was probably 19 years old.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.090
I tried to bang her.

57:49.591 --> 57:52.886
Back there, that was the Gate of Horn.
You opened for Peter, Paul and Mary there.

57:52.969 --> 57:53.970
The Kingston Trio.

57:54.053 --> 57:57.056
[Al] All those great clubs - gone.

57:57.515 --> 57:59.184
Where the hell do people go now?

58:31.257 --> 58:33.009
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.220
Why aren't you in there with her?

58:36.095 --> 58:36.971
I don't know.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.933
- Isn't that the point?
- We never discussed it.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.018
I'm out of practice,
I don't know what I'm doing.

58:42.101 --> 58:44.771
Isn't it obvious that she wants you

58:44.854 --> 58:46.934
- to spend the night with her?
- You don't know that.

58:46.981 --> 58:49.150
Well, why the hell else would she be here?

58:49.234 --> 58:52.070
- I don't want to be presumptious, okay?
- Oh, God!

58:52.153 --> 58:53.738
You are so nuts!

58:53.821 --> 58:56.157
Hey, guys,
you want to keep it down out here?

58:56.241 --> 58:58.535
- What's going on?
- Don't worry, get back in the room.

58:58.618 --> 59:01.704
You think you're hot shit
'cause you're in <i>Jerry Springer!</i>

59:01.788 --> 59:03.623
- Loser!
- What if she says no?

59:04.666 --> 59:05.917
I can't take the rejection.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.253
Then you can spend the night
in here with me.

59:08.336 --> 59:09.379
You ask her.

59:09.462 --> 59:11.714
Just ask her where I'm sleeping,
that's all.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.841
Don't... Hey, no.

59:13.967 --> 59:16.386
I'm sorry, I don't want to know.

59:17.136 --> 59:18.763
Look, Al...

59:19.264 --> 59:24.394
she's a free love hippie spirit
who went to Woodstock.

59:24.727 --> 59:27.021
If you don't go in there, I will.

59:31.776 --> 59:32.819
I gotta take this.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.323
Vic! How are you?

59:37.907 --> 59:39.325
I've been waiting for your call.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.077
[laughs]

59:41.327 --> 59:42.745
Yeah. So, what's the latest?

59:59.637 --> 01:00:00.763
[Doris] I'm so sorry.

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:03.057
[Al] Who am I kidding?

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.269
You can't just get somebody
on The Tonight Show.

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.773
Well,
look at all that you've accomplished.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.943
I would say you've been a great success.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.740
I think it's wonderful
that you're doing what you love,

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:23.369
but what about
when you can't do it anymore?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.127
I will never play canasta!

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:35.214
I will not take the short bus
to the mall ever again!

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:40.094
All I know how to do is work.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:44.223
I don't know who I am without it.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:53.483
You know what I do when I have
a really hard decision to make?

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:55.442
Mushrooms.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:56.986
Shrooms?

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.823
Jesus Christ! I'm falling for a pusher.

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.825
It's a beautiful night, Al,

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.203
and only good things happen
when we let go.

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:09.957
Uh... Okay.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:42.115
[Buddy] I am thinking about a song.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.199
What?

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.662
I'm thinking about
bringing a song into the act.

01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:50.665
I think it will be a great thing
for The Tonight Show.

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:52.624
I don't like it.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.336
- Why not?
- I don't like when comedians sing.

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:57.171
I hate musicals.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.425
When somebody just breaks out into song
for no damn reason...

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.635
[Al sings a note]

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.178
That makes me sad.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:05.680
I love musicals.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.224
How are you feeling, Buddy?

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:10.476
Like a chaperone on prom night.

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:17.775
Oh, my gosh, look at you guys!

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:20.111
Wow, what an entrance!

01:02:20.194 --> 01:02:21.320
Hey, Jimbo!

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.656
Al Hart. How are you?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.867
Never better, man.
I want you to meet somebody.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.076
Buddy Green.

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:32.623
- Wow, what an honor!
- Oh, thank you.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.209
I heard you took a few years off,
like your entire career?

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.044
[laughs] Yeah, a few.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:39.255
You look fantastic, Jimbo.
Did you lose weight?

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:41.424
- I put on 75 pounds.
- Oh, that's what I mean.

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:44.260
You look good for a fat guy.
Your clothes are very stylish, though.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:46.679
- I bought these at Goodwill.
- Stylish in 1985.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.847
How's your beautiful wife?

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.098
She left me two years ago.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.057
Ah, good riddance.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.517
- Never liked her.
- Hey!

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.019
Are you stealing my bit?

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.563
Wait a minute. <i>The Agents </i> is your bit?
I thought it was Al's.

01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:57.857
Al wouldn't know funny if it blew him.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.025
I think he's hilarious.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.486
For a manager, but <i>as </i> a manager...

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.362
He booked you here.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.739
He <i>drove </i> us here.

01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:06.741
- He's a terrible driver.
- He drove from LA!

01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:07.867
Like a pilot.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:11.871
- All right.
- Jimbo, I want you to meet Doris.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:12.954
Doris, Jimbo.

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:14.414
I'm the mascot!

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:18.669
Look at you. You're beautiful!
You're a two knuckler.

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:21.087
What's a two knuckler?

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.173
[all laugh]

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:25.760
All right, here,
let me show you your dressing room.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.452
- Come on. We'll be back out soon.
- Yeah, we'll be right in.

01:03:29.013 --> 01:03:30.598
I'm starting to feel a little tingly.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.644
God, you look good!
That's a beautiful dress.

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.314
I don't know, I feel...

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.943
Look at the colors, even at night!

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.279
It's good.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.241
I feel footloose and fancy free.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.451
Grandpa!

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.626
How strong is this shit?

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.087
I don't think you're hallucinating yet.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.088
- Hey!
- Jeannie!

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.047
Hi!

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.257
What are you doing here?

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.177
- This is Charlie Green. It's Buddy's son.
- Hi.

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:11.596
Is this real?

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:13.641
- This is Charlie Green?
- Yeah.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:14.724
This is real?

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:20.022
I remember you
when you were just a small girl.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.276
I'm kidding you, Charlie.
Your dad talks about you a lot.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.527
Is he okay?

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.028
He's in top form.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.781
He just went in if you want to,
you know...

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:31.343
- Okay, I'm gonna go in.
- Okay.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.077
- Excuse me, my dad is inside.
- Okay.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:35.830
You've grown into a fine young man,
Charlie.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.124
Okay. All right.

01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:40.917
A little uptight, huh?

01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:43.921
He's upset. You never called.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:46.090
- I didn't call?
- You know you didn't call.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:48.134
- I could have sworn we just talked.
- Grandpa!

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.636
I've heard so many lovely things
about you.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.388
Oh, thank you.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.058
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm Doris.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.602
I met Doris in Kansas.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.728
Not bad, huh?

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:02.106
Grandpa's still got game.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:03.523
Grandpa...

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.734
Can we talk for a sec?

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:08.863
Sure, you two talk.
I'm gonna go pet the horse.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.322
Okay.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.950
His name is Lincoln, as in Abraham.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.034
No relation.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.121
It's really good to see you, kid.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.708
It's good to see you, Dad.

01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:23.669
But what the hell are you doing?

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:26.130
I'm on tour.

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:28.966
Since when does my father,

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.721
Dr Edward Green, podiatrist, go on tour?

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.682
You know, nobody ever asked their parents:

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:39.685
"What did you do
before you were a parent?"

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:42.730
This is what I did, Charlie.

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:45.775
I do not understand.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.069
I was a comic.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.948
And I could have been maybe big,
maybe not.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:56.077
But I didn't stick around long enough
to find out.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.621
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:00.998
Are you losing your mind, too?

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.291
I had a cousin, Murray.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:08.923
He left his wife and kids and he moved
in with a man named Little Leo.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:14.220
Nobody ever asked Murray, "What did you do
before you were a parent?"

01:06:15.846 --> 01:06:17.139
Are you gay, too, Dad?

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:19.934
No.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:22.687
I'm a closeted comedian.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.398
[Al] That life isn't for me, sweetheart.

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:27.149
I felt like an inmate.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.026
So, you drag Buddy into this?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.195
I didn't drag him anywhere. He came.

01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:32.697
This was his idea.

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:37.076
Maybe I put the idea in his head,
but it was his decision.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.078
He shouldn’t be exerting himself.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:42.206
Exerting? The guy was humping every night
back at the home!

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:43.916
Lucky bastard!

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.419
Okay. Grandpa, this is dangerous!

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:50.256
How is it dangerous?
I mean, he’s in better shape than me.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.259
You don't know, do you?

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.388
Why are you so upset? Why?

01:06:57.638 --> 01:07:00.182
Really?
None of this makes any sense to you?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.350
Okay, hey!

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:04.353
You were missing. Vanished.

01:07:04.937 --> 01:07:08.482
And now I find you living some secret life
as Rodney Dangerfield,

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.944
and I'm just supposed to be thrilled
that you suddenly found yourself at 80?

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:13.653
Yes.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.033
Charlie, I know what I’m doing

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:19.076
I'm a grown man.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:22.955
You're also a sick man.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:27.376
Why do you even bring that up?
What does that have to do with anything?

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:28.836
I feel fine.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:33.758
Oh, my God...

01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.094
It's pancreatic.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.929
Oh, Jesus!

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:43.100
That's... the worst kind. I...

01:07:43.517 --> 01:07:45.728
Charlie thinks
that this trip could kill him.

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:49.065
I don’t know
how to process this right now.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.484
Grandpa, are you all right?

01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:53.526
Here. Are you Okay?

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.738
It's just the shrooms.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.572
How bad is he?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.283
It's terminal.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.827
What do you mean, "shrooms"?

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:13.839
When I was a kid, my friends always used
to want to eat dinner at our house.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.929
I couldn’t understand it
because Mom wasn’t that great a cook.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.598
But almost every day,

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.102
someone would ask, “Hey, Charlie,
can I come over for dinner?”

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.438
For a second, I thought I was popular.

01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:32.483
You cracked those kids up.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.528
You were always
the funniest dad in the world.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.988
You didn't give up a career.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:41.200
You just... found a different audience.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.162
I want my kids to have that experience
while they can.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.038
They deserve to laugh like that.

01:08:47.997 --> 01:08:49.750
They haven't heard them all yet.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.551
Hey...

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.682
Oh, Jesus, come on!

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.475
Don't be so dramatic.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.228
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.442
Charlie, I've had a great life.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:19.529
I didn't live it exactly the way
I thought I would,

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:23.826
but at least let me die the way I want.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.957
I should have known.
All that pot he smokes...

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:32.917
He calls it his medicine.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.214
Al, he’s all settled.
I’m gonna get you to the table.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:38.881
Mascot?

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.011
How's everybody doing?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.724
He's making a comeback, actually,
after 50 years.

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:49.560
50. That's 5-0, folks.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.813
I am serious as a heart attack.
I hope he doesn't have one.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:57.318
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the stage

01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:59.028

01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:11.956

What?

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:06.580
Vic didn't come through. I'm sorry.

01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:11.460
Look, we did it.
We played all the way to Chicago.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.545
Let's go back and celebrate.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.631
What the fuck is this?

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:19.926
Do you think that I give a shit
about The Tonight Show?

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:22.888
That was your idea, anyway!

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.766
I'm going to New York!

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:26.933
It's finished, Buddy.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:32.314
It's time to... you know, retire.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:43.742
You drag me through the dregs
of third-rate nightclubs

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.661
so I can shit my guts out,

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:49.414
almost get lynched in Lubbock
with that kooky broad

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:54.961
and now you're telling me...
that <i>I've </i> got to quit?

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:59.007
- Maybe that is why Max Becker fired you.
- That's bullshit.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:02.886
Maybe that is why
Max Becker is doing the Colbert show

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:06.556
and you are trying to drag me
back to that fucking home.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.016
That's bullshit and you know it!

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.395
Becker's playing Colbert. Well, fuck him.
And fuck you.

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:13.146
Fuck <i>me?</i>

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.107
You're the one who's quitting.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.776
Oh, really?
You want to talk about quitting?

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.319
You fucked me over, Buddy.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.239
- Oh, here we go.
- You almost killed my career.

01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:24.449
You let me holding my dick,
just like Arty.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.411
- I should have anticipated this.
- Just like Becker.

01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:29.496
- You all quit on me, Buddy.
- [Buddy mumbles]

01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:32.082
My whole life, I never quit on one soul.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:33.917
Until now.

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.677
I know you're sick, Buddy.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.054
Jeannie told me, yeah.

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.766
Motherfucker...

01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:53.103
Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:56.690
I was gonna tell you after Kansas.

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.068
But that's when
you brought the girl along.

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:02.112
Christ, sucking...

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.159

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.409
I...

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:16.835
I could have... two more months
or maybe a year.

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:20.172
Fucking doctors can't make up their minds.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.677
It's like the guy whose doctor tells him,
"You've got six months to live."

01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:30.849
And the guy says, "I can't pay the bill."

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:35.729
And the doctor says,
"Okay, I'll give you another six months."

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:41.193
I don't regret the choices I've made, Al.

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:43.235
But...

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.323
If we quit now...

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:50.160
that will be the only thing...

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:55.832
this dying man will truly regret.

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.714
Way to fucking milk that disease!

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.056
Hold it!

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:13.642

That's a touching story, Al.

I really feel for the guy.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.437
He should have a shot.

I'm sure.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.534
But not in my slot!

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:00.790
You got a lot of years ahead of you, Max.

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:02.876
Not to mention...

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:06.504
and I'm not trying to play the guilt card,
but you kind of owe me one.

I'm sorry, refresh my memory.

- That was...
- Look, Max,

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.271
I didn't come here looking for an apology
or a handout.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:29.069
I came to appeal... to you...
as a human being.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:32.447
I'm not a human being. I'm a comedian!

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:35.283
A comedian
with serious fucking money troubles!

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.828
Look, do I feel bad that I left you?

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.289
Sure.
Likewise, I feel bad for your friend.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:42.790
But...

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:45.669
But too fucking bad!

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:50.882
I got two mortgages I can't afford,
I got two ex-wives,

I get on Colbert and my quote skyrockets.

I'm sorry your friend's gonna die,
but he had his shot.

01:23:13.446 --> 01:23:17.117

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:31.047

I call it a <i>soborno.</i>

So, tell me... how much do you need?

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:43.309
I think you should go.

01:23:55.530 --> 01:24:00.702
The first comic I ever booked
got paid 50 bucks.

01:24:01.619 --> 01:24:03.288
My take was $5.

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:06.124
That was in 1963.

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:14.007
And that $5 is still sitting at the bottom
of a big, fat, useless bank account

01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:18.928
with a million more fives
that never bought me a scrap of joy

01:24:19.262 --> 01:24:20.847
without the ability to earn it.

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:26.352
You see, I'm one of those guys
who didn't work to live.

I live to work.

01:24:32.942 --> 01:24:34.235
Now, I don't work.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:37.489
Which means I have
to figure out how to live.

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:43.286
So, I don't have
a fucking life right now, Max.

01:24:43.953 --> 01:24:45.121
But I need one.

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:47.874
And you're gonna give it to me.

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.044
So, I'll ask one more time.

I used to tell a lot of cheap jokes,
but I am done.

I'm done with cheap jokes.

Jokes are easy. People email jokes

you know exactly what I'm talking about

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:55.306
Did you ever see an old person
in a restaurant not send the meal back?

01:29:56.557 --> 01:30:00.144
"Give me a perfect frigging meal.
I am about to die."

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.399
<i>So, that's why I don't tell jokes anymore.</i>

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:06.901
<i>It's a waste of time.</i>

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:10.613
<i>Life is a big enough joke.</i>

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.930
<i>And that's why we need funny people.</i>

01:30:36.722 --> 01:30:40.643
Not just on TV, but at work, at home...

01:30:41.644 --> 01:30:43.020
at the doctor's office.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:49.735
It took me 50 years to figure that out
and I still can't use the remote.

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:54.490
One more thing.
Ed Sullivan - if you're watching,

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:55.950
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.285
I'll see you soon.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:44.999
[Sunshine] <i>Gentlemen, I am well aware
of the unpleasant news</i>

01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:46.584
<i>that I've brought you in the past.</i>

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:50.213
<i>But I tell you something.
Nothing - and I mean nothing -</i>

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:51.631
<i>could prepare me for this one.</i>

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:54.884
Did you hear about Al?

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:59.305
<i>Apparently, he lost everything.</i>

01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:02.850
<i>Forced to move into
some old folks' home in the Midwest.</i>

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:07.355
<i>Can you imagine being sent
to a place like that?</i>

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:13.903
<i>If I could stand up,</i>

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:16.030
I'd hang myself.
