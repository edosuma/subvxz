00:22.401 --> 00:24.528
<i>E</i> arthquake!

00:31.109 --> 00:34.977
...is a dance, and apparently you know it.

01:50.522 --> 01:53.082
- <i>E</i> xceptional buns, Geoffrey.
- Thank you, sir.

01:53.158 --> 01:55.718
Y es, I think he's been doing
the StairMaster.

01:56.695 --> 01:58.993
Where's your mother?
Her breakfast is getting cold.

01:59.064 --> 02:00.361
She's not eating.

02:00.432 --> 02:02.593
Not until she can fit
into her old wedding gown.

02:02.668 --> 02:04.329
That's ridiculous.

02:04.569 --> 02:08.300
Y ou wouldn't expect me to fit into
a pair of pants I wore 25 years ago.

02:08.473 --> 02:10.770
Or 25 days ago, for that matter.

02:12.544 --> 02:14.910
Y ou know,
she has nothing to worry about.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.039
She's as beautiful as the day I married her.

02:17.115 --> 02:19.709
Which is why I'm going to
renew our vows this Saturday.

02:20.252 --> 02:22.447
That is so romantic.

02:22.788 --> 02:25.552
I wish I could find a guy
to lie to me like that.

02:26.358 --> 02:28.553
Sir, about Saturday's menu...

02:28.794 --> 02:31.456
shall I prepare the same meal
you had at your wedding?

02:31.530 --> 02:35.261
G, how's he supposed to remember
what he had for dinner 25 years ago?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.530
Well, we started out
with some chicken pot pie...

02:39.004 --> 02:41.472
and some delicious coleslaw.

02:41.740 --> 02:46.234
And then there was some really, really
great baked beans, with, what, molasses.

02:46.511 --> 02:50.413
And for dessert, we had a big huge chunk
of chocolate devil's food cake.

02:54.986 --> 02:56.419
I'm guessing.

02:57.189 --> 02:59.987
If only that power could be used for good.

03:01.159 --> 03:04.185
Maybe I'll go upstairs
to try to cheer up your mother.

03:04.596 --> 03:06.154
I'm so fat!

03:07.365 --> 03:09.993
On second thought,
I'll call her from the car.

03:13.271 --> 03:14.863
Good, he's gone.

03:15.907 --> 03:19.035
Great, now we can finish working
on their anniversary surprise.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.635
I hope they like this photo album.

03:20.712 --> 03:23.840
What's not to like?
We got some great family pictures.

03:24.549 --> 03:26.710
Look, here's me at the beach.

03:27.319 --> 03:29.480
And here's me in my carriage.

03:31.323 --> 03:33.883
Look, and here's me at the park.

03:34.426 --> 03:36.986
I knew we should have gotten them
those Ginsu knives.

03:37.062 --> 03:38.757
This stuff is so boring.

03:38.830 --> 03:42.197
Carlton's right. Nothing exciting
ever happens to our family.

03:42.901 --> 03:45.802
Well, that's right, y'all,
and that's why I came out here...

03:45.871 --> 03:47.668
'cause you people really need help.

03:59.584 --> 04:04.248
Carlton Banks is wearing an elegant,
yet masculine cotton-silk combination...

04:04.689 --> 04:06.680
designed by Will St. LeCarlton.

04:07.793 --> 04:10.353
Six, seven, eight and contract, hut.

04:11.563 --> 04:13.656
Five and six and seven, eight.

04:17.969 --> 04:21.200
Fingers open. Spread 'em out and look.

04:22.072 --> 04:24.303
Contract, release, hut...

04:24.509 --> 04:25.999
and up and ten...

04:26.144 --> 04:30.308
and pose, hut, repeat.
Five and six and seven, eight, hut.

04:54.306 --> 04:55.500
Say...

04:56.241 --> 04:58.971
is that Philip Banks or Blair Underwood?

05:18.129 --> 05:20.120
What do you think of this one, Dad?

05:20.198 --> 05:22.758
I look like Little Richard, attorney at law.

05:24.369 --> 05:26.030
Dinner is served.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.000
A-wop-bop-a-Ioo-bop, a-Iop-bam-boom.

05:37.015 --> 05:40.974
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the star of <i>Heidi Comes To Har/em.</i>

05:42.921 --> 05:45.890
Mom, if you make me
go to school like this...

05:45.957 --> 05:48.425
I'm going to write a book when I grow up.

05:50.996 --> 05:52.759
Welcome to the Briny Deep...

05:52.831 --> 05:55.026
where none of our prices
are ever too steep.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.159
We've got fresh fish,
you can look in our tank.

05:57.235 --> 06:00.295
To get to the bathroom,
make a left at the plank. Follow me.

06:03.241 --> 06:06.699
Look, I know everyone gets
a little silly around mid-terms...

06:07.279 --> 06:10.271
- but not at the dinner table.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

06:11.449 --> 06:13.713
Will Smith is the scum of the earth.

06:14.052 --> 06:15.280
Hilary!

06:20.191 --> 06:23.319
However, Will Smith
is the pinnacle of manliness.

06:33.505 --> 06:34.699
Hilary!

06:39.611 --> 06:41.340
What's with Hilary?

06:44.115 --> 06:46.447
Hilary! Hilary! Hilary!

06:46.851 --> 06:48.375
Stop it! Stop it!

06:49.487 --> 06:51.717
Y our Montrose vase...

06:51.823 --> 06:55.554
attracts dust like a magnet!

06:55.627 --> 06:56.787
G, listen.

06:58.530 --> 07:00.088
Problem solved.

07:00.498 --> 07:02.125
Okay, G, listen.

07:02.467 --> 07:07.029
Philip, I have $1,000 with your name on it.

07:07.372 --> 07:10.705
Do the family a favor,
get Viv some cooking lessons.

07:10.775 --> 07:12.242
Y ou!

07:13.211 --> 07:16.977
And, Miss Ashley,
how does a Mercedes sound?

07:17.349 --> 07:18.611
Vroom, vroom?

07:18.817 --> 07:21.047
Very clever. I'll get you two.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.083
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

07:26.257 --> 07:27.781
Nice try.

07:29.861 --> 07:32.125
In case you hadn't figured it out...

07:33.231 --> 07:34.459
I quit!

07:42.273 --> 07:44.935
For a long time, it gave me nightmares.

07:46.444 --> 07:49.174
Having to witness an injustice like that.

07:51.316 --> 07:55.116
It was a constant reminder
of how unfair this world can be.

07:57.689 --> 08:00.214
I can still hear them taunting him.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.894
"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids."

08:16.241 --> 08:19.404
How come they just
couldn't give him some cereal?

08:19.844 --> 08:24.781
<i>Hi, /'m Phi/ip Banks,</i>
<i>and /'m running for superior court judge.</i>

08:33.258 --> 08:35.158
What the hell is that?

08:35.894 --> 08:38.124
That was our New y ear's <i>E</i> ve party.

08:38.196 --> 08:40.756
Uncle Phil, you know,
I just put in a couple of home movies...

08:40.832 --> 08:44.097
you know, to show your human side.
It gets better, check it out.

08:44.536 --> 08:47.994
<i>And if you put me on the Bench,</i>
<i>/'// take a rea/ bite out of crime.</i>

08:48.073 --> 08:50.439
<i>Bite. Bite. Bite.</i>

08:55.380 --> 08:57.211
<i>Vote for Phi/ip Banks.</i>

08:57.282 --> 09:00.979
<i>Phi/ip Banks. Phi/ip Banks. Phi/ip Banks.</i>

09:15.366 --> 09:18.392
Where's the family room?
Man, I'm going to kill Carlton.

09:18.470 --> 09:21.200
Kill him? I want to know
the name of his decorator.

09:37.055 --> 09:40.115
- No, I'm sorry.
- What do you two think you're doing?

09:41.426 --> 09:43.553
I was trying to get up to my room.

09:46.164 --> 09:49.099
- Tom, what was you doing?
- I was trying to be in the video.

09:52.770 --> 09:57.332
Look, a Donna Karan suit,
right in the middle of the kitchen floor.

09:58.710 --> 09:59.870
What color?

10:02.046 --> 10:04.071
Y ou gotta come out to see that.

10:04.849 --> 10:06.680
Sorry, Will, it won't work.

10:09.554 --> 10:12.352
Look, G, she won't listen to me, man.
I give up.

10:16.227 --> 10:18.787
I think it's time
you came out of the closet.

10:20.498 --> 10:21.692
Let me.

10:23.234 --> 10:24.326
Sonny...

10:24.402 --> 10:28.896
what you do in the privacy of the bedroom
is nobody's business but yours.

10:29.741 --> 10:32.107
Just be true to yourself.

10:34.212 --> 10:35.611
He'll come around.

11:02.273 --> 11:03.740
Take it off!

11:04.108 --> 11:05.666
Put it on!

11:07.679 --> 11:10.876
Carlton Banks,
you put your clothes on this minute.

11:10.982 --> 11:12.142
Mommy!

11:17.722 --> 11:18.780
Wow!

11:19.791 --> 11:21.918
Will, check out the talent.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.362
She's cool. She's hot. She's...

11:26.431 --> 11:28.331
y our baby sister, man!

11:36.074 --> 11:40.033
Carlton's log. <i>E</i> arth date 1992.

11:40.912 --> 11:42.311
It's 6:00 a.m.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.905
Up with the dawn,
the small band of brave souls...

11:44.983 --> 11:47.349
prepare to pile into their Mercedes.

11:47.885 --> 11:50.979
Destination: Adventure.

11:53.758 --> 11:57.091
Hey, I didn't know
Mom was a ventriloquist.

11:57.362 --> 12:00.661
Look at that funny-Iooking
little dummy on her knee.

12:01.232 --> 12:03.029
Ashley, that's Carlton.

12:08.339 --> 12:09.670
Uncle Phil, what's up?

12:09.741 --> 12:11.936
- Where is it?
- Geoffrey took it, I swear!

12:12.010 --> 12:14.672
Oh, my God,
your Aunt Vivian's going to kill me.

12:14.746 --> 12:18.273
Uncle Phil, look, you're winning a lot
of points with this second wedding thing.

12:18.349 --> 12:20.579
I'm sure whatever it is, she can handle it.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.552
I lost my wedding ring.

12:24.489 --> 12:27.083
So, where shall we scatter the ashes?

12:37.068 --> 12:40.469
I cannot believe I wore that ring
every day for 25 years...

12:40.538 --> 12:42.403
and the day before my anniversary,
I lose it.

12:42.473 --> 12:43.599
Okay, now, just think.

12:43.675 --> 12:47.509
Maybe it will help if you remember
what you were doing when you lost it.

12:47.578 --> 12:48.977
I was eating.

12:49.914 --> 12:51.711
That narrows it down.

12:55.086 --> 12:56.519
Hey, what up, J?

12:57.655 --> 12:58.952
Greetings, all.

12:59.090 --> 13:02.526
I guess my invitation to the wedding rerun
was misplaced.

13:02.593 --> 13:04.823
But I thought I'd come by anyway.

13:05.363 --> 13:07.991
I'm guessing the bride
won't be wearing white.

13:09.300 --> 13:12.235
Jazz, the ceremony
isn't till tomorrow, man.

13:12.370 --> 13:14.463
Then I'll be spending the night.

13:15.406 --> 13:18.569
I hear the pool house
has a delightful northern exposure.

13:18.976 --> 13:22.070
Hilary, woman, draw me a bath.

13:23.648 --> 13:25.775
I wouldn't draw you a cartoon.

13:25.850 --> 13:28.410
- That's it. That's it. I'm out of here.
- Wait.

13:28.519 --> 13:29.986
Jazz, come here, man.

13:30.054 --> 13:32.955
Look, this is not the right time
to mess with Uncle Phil.

13:33.024 --> 13:35.254
He lost something really important.

13:35.326 --> 13:37.191
Geoffrey took it. I swear.

13:38.496 --> 13:42.489
Look, kids, you look down here.
I'm going to look for the ring upstairs.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.695
Give it up, big guy,
we've already looked everywhere.

13:45.903 --> 13:47.928
I'll give $100 to the first one who finds it.

13:48.005 --> 13:49.563
Now you're talking.

13:54.679 --> 13:56.044
My family.

13:57.315 --> 14:00.478
Can't live with 'em,
can't turn your back on 'em.

14:12.663 --> 14:14.392
Ouch! Oh, my eye!

14:15.199 --> 14:16.928
Will, are you okay?

14:18.169 --> 14:19.966
Here's your question.

14:20.405 --> 14:24.671
If your partner could name
only one person as his best friend...

14:25.176 --> 14:27.337
who would that special person be?

14:27.412 --> 14:30.438
Now, you have until the buzzer sounds
to think about it.

15:01.979 --> 15:04.209
Time is up.
All right, Carlton, let's hear your answer.

15:04.282 --> 15:08.446
Well, Bob, let's back it up for a moment
and define this thing called friendship.

15:08.519 --> 15:10.714
Y ou see, the ancient Mayans...

15:12.490 --> 15:14.185
Carlton, your time is up.

15:14.258 --> 15:17.318
Okay, Tyriq, who is Jazz's best friend?

15:18.629 --> 15:21.120
I'm sorry, Bob, this is a bad time.

16:39.510 --> 16:41.944
- Goodnight, Will.
- Y ou're grounded.

16:57.929 --> 17:01.365
All right, all right, all right.
<i>E</i> verybody out, come on.

17:04.635 --> 17:08.537
Look, the next step is
full-scale psychological warfare, right?

17:08.638 --> 17:11.574
Y ou gotta act like you got this tic, right?

17:11.776 --> 17:15.940
Like the army did this experiment on you,
right, that just went terribly wrong.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.310
Y ou're like, back up! Back up!

17:18.382 --> 17:21.282
Mind your business, that's all.
Mind your business.

17:22.987 --> 17:24.079
Okay.

17:24.755 --> 17:26.586
Back up! Back up!

17:27.458 --> 17:30.586
Mind your business, that's all,
just mind your business.

17:32.029 --> 17:34.623
I work all day trying
to keep this house nice for you.

17:34.699 --> 17:37.566
I cook and clean
and work my fingers to the bone.

17:37.635 --> 17:39.432
And this is the thanks I get?

17:39.537 --> 17:41.903
Well, I bust my hump at school all day...

17:41.973 --> 17:45.773
and you just sit around here watching
soap operas and eating bonbons.

17:46.777 --> 17:49.268
Well, excuse me for having a little fun.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.576
Maybe it's because
you never take me out anymore.

17:54.085 --> 17:57.714
Well, maybe I would
if you fixed yourself up a little bit.

17:59.323 --> 18:00.688
Wait a minute.

18:01.258 --> 18:03.453
We sound like an old married couple.

18:04.295 --> 18:05.819
So now I'm old.

18:08.633 --> 18:11.124
And I gave you the best years of my life.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.198
Look, I'm sorry.

19:27.044 --> 19:28.409
I'm hungry.

19:28.579 --> 19:30.809
Don't you have any more breath mints?

19:30.881 --> 19:33.611
No, you ate them all
without offering me one.

19:33.684 --> 19:37.279
- Can't have my toothpick, either.
- Did I ask you?

19:38.155 --> 19:40.385
Look, baby, why don't you
just look in the freezer...

19:40.458 --> 19:41.925
and see if there's something in there?

19:41.992 --> 19:44.392
- Would you look?
- Why don't you look?

19:44.462 --> 19:46.555
I thought you liked doing things for me.

19:46.630 --> 19:49.190
Y es, I did till you ate all my breath mints.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.968
Forget it, I don't need you
to do anything for me.

19:58.008 --> 19:59.498
Could you open this?

20:00.144 --> 20:02.271
Thought you ain't need me
to do nothing for you.

20:02.346 --> 20:03.836
Just open it.

20:04.682 --> 20:07.150
- What's the magic word?
- Now.

20:11.722 --> 20:12.916
Guess again.

20:16.627 --> 20:18.060
Here, look, I can't open this thing.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.427
I thought you're supposed to be
the big man.

20:20.498 --> 20:23.194
Look, you're the one who's hungry.
Use your fingernails.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.963
Look. Here.

20:27.371 --> 20:29.100
Knock yourself out.

20:44.088 --> 20:45.988
Any luck with the ring, Dad?

20:46.056 --> 20:48.752
No, but don't worry about it,
I figured it out.

20:48.959 --> 20:52.019
In the middle of the ceremony,
I'll fake a heart attack.

20:52.496 --> 20:54.964
Come on, Uncle Phil,
it didn't work on your wedding night...

20:55.032 --> 20:56.727
and it ain't going to work now.

20:59.103 --> 21:01.071
Here comes Hilary. Places.

21:05.876 --> 21:08.037
She looks so beautiful.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.511
Thank you.

21:10.614 --> 21:14.277
Not you. Mom.
Look, she fit into her wedding dress.

21:16.754 --> 21:19.222
<i>E</i> verybody, duck.
I think she's about to blow.

21:19.290 --> 21:20.382
Jazz!

21:24.862 --> 21:28.821
We're gathered here today
to renew the vows of holy matrimony...

21:29.466 --> 21:31.457
which is commended...

21:32.803 --> 21:35.567
- I didn't know you were so sentimental.
- I'm not.

21:36.574 --> 21:41.068
It's just, always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

21:42.947 --> 21:46.747
Vivian Banks, do you take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

21:47.952 --> 21:49.613
With all my heart.

21:49.720 --> 21:53.713
And do you, Philip Banks, take this
woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?

21:53.791 --> 21:55.782
- No, I don't.
- What?

21:56.560 --> 21:59.051
I take her for much more than that.

21:59.463 --> 22:00.987
For my lover...

22:01.298 --> 22:02.959
my life companion...

22:03.734 --> 22:05.463
my very best friend.

22:05.970 --> 22:07.198
Oh, Philip.

22:07.771 --> 22:09.261
May I have the ring, please?

22:09.340 --> 22:12.673
- Here it is, Daddy.
- I got one for you right here, buddy.

22:18.582 --> 22:20.550
Thanks, kids, but...

22:21.118 --> 22:24.281
Look, Vivian,
there's something I have to tell you.

22:24.355 --> 22:26.755
I lost my wedding ring.

22:27.358 --> 22:29.019
Y ou mean this one?

22:29.526 --> 22:30.550
Y ou found it!

22:30.628 --> 22:33.028
Y eah, I took it to have it inscribed.
See, look.

22:33.564 --> 22:35.964
"To a hundred years more."

22:36.967 --> 22:38.764
Now you may kiss the bride.

22:39.305 --> 22:45.218
