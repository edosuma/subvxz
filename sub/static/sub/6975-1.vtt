03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
What is this?!

03:19.100 --> 03:20.500
Excuse me.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.700
Can somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

03:24.700 --> 03:26.700
We're collecting material.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.400
For?

03:28.400 --> 03:31.900
For anything that might be
pertinent to the manhunt.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.900
What manhunt?
Manhunt for who?

03:35.900 --> 03:38.300
You're kidding, right?

03:38.800 --> 03:43.100
Look, there's nothing. If you're looking
for Mulder, you're wasting your time.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.900
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not the man to talk to.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.700
Well, then whose stupid idea is this?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.700
Yeah, well, somebody might have
had the courtesy to tell me.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.800
There are agents tearing apart
Mulder's office...

03:56.800 --> 03:58.600
...who say they're part of
an FBI manhunt.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.600
I know. I heard.
Believe me, this is not my idea.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.800
I just found out about it myself.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.000
They're not going to find Mulder this way.
You know that and I know that.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.600
I told you last night, I will find him.
I'm going to do that.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.300
Okay?

04:12.300 --> 04:14.500
Now, I want you just to cool out.
I don't want you doing...

04:14.500 --> 04:18.500
- ...anything to upset your pregnancy.
- Look, I don't understand.

04:18.500 --> 04:23.100
You are the Assistant Director.
Who is going over your head on this?

04:23.100 --> 04:26.100
Our brand-new deputy director.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.100
A.D. Skinner, Agent Scully.
Thanks for getting right over.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.700
I don't want to lose any time.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.100
We have one of our own missing...

04:48.100 --> 04:52.600
...and the only acceptable outcome is
that we find him safe and alive.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.000
- I'm sure the two of you agree.
- That goes without saying, sir.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.600
Good.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.600
This comes at a stressful time,
with my new appointment.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.600
But I'm thankful for your
cooperation in the hunt for Mulder.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.300
Our cooperation?

05:10.300 --> 05:13.700
With due respect,
there aren't two people better qualified...

05:13.700 --> 05:16.200
...to be directing this action, sir.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.300
Right now, you and A.D. Skinner
are the two primary witnesses...

05:19.300 --> 05:21.000
...to Mulder's disappearance.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.600
I want your statement taken asap.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.200
You make us out to be suspects, sir.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.500
Taken by who?

05:29.500 --> 05:33.700
My task force leader on this,
Special Agent John Doggett.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.500
He's waiting to hear from you now.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.300
One more thing.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.600
Anything leaves this building...

05:52.600 --> 05:56.400
...about aliens or alien abductions...

05:56.400 --> 06:00.200
...or any other nonsense that might cast
the Bureau in a ridiculous light, ...

06:00.200 --> 06:03.200
...hey, you can forget about
looking for Agent Mulder.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.800
You'll both be looking
for new jobs.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.700
That's all.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.500
I don't believe this.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.900
This isn't about finding Mulder--
this is about Kersh covering the FBI's ass.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.900
Why do I get the feeling they'd be
happy if we never found him at all?

06:31.200 --> 06:35.300
Look... I saw what I saw.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.200
I have to make a statement in there.
I'm not going to tell them it didn't happen.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.100
Well, you heard Kersh.
They don't want the truth.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.200
You give them the truth,
and they'll hang you with it.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.700
They can hang me with a lie, too.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.100
I'm not going to sell Mulder out.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.400
What good are you to Mulder...

06:56.400 --> 07:01.300
...if you give them the power
to ruin your career?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.700
We will find him.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.000
Assistant Director,
you can come on back with me.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.400
Agent Scully, I'll ask you to please
wait on the wall until we call you.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.100
Water?

08:10.900 --> 08:13.500
It could be a wait.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.100
Thank you.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.500
- Weren't you his partner? Mulder?
- Yes.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.700
I guess nobody's beyond
suspicion on this thing.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.200
Why are they talking to you?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.900
Me? I knew Mulder back a bit.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.700
They're developing a working
profile-- character background.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.000
I'd say they have all the character
profile they need on him.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.900
Certainly his reputation.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.600
I doubt we agents ever really truly
know each other even our partners.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.600
Not at the end of the day.

08:55.600 --> 09:01.600
Their real lives, their friends, girlfriends,
deeply personal things, issues.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.800
I think I know Mulder as
much as anybody.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.200
Yeah, probably so.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.300
I always took the rumors
with a grain of salt.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.600
- What rumors are those?
- Well, you know.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.500
Well, that, from the beginning he never
felt a real trust with you, ...

09:24.500 --> 09:27.200
...that you were ambitious.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.500
Where'd that come from?

09:30.100 --> 09:34.700
There are women here at the Bureau
that he would confide in.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.900
I don't know if you knew that or not.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
No.

09:41.900 --> 09:46.300
- When was this?
- I don't know, it's just talk.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.500
So, what do you think happened?

09:54.500 --> 09:58.700
To Mulder?
What's your theory?

10:00.600 --> 10:04.100
What's my theory?

10:06.800 --> 10:11.100
My theory is you don't
know Mulder at all.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.300
You never did.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.000
"John Doggett."

10:24.900 --> 10:28.600
Kersh's task force leader.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.200
You might have just
introduced yourself.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.200
Well, I was getting around to it.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.800
Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.400
<i>Hi, this is Margaret Scully.
Please leave a message.</i>

12:35.400 --> 12:38.200
Mom, it's Dana. I, uh...

12:38.200 --> 12:41.000
I'm sorry I haven't called you
in a while. I've been...

12:41.000 --> 12:44.700
...busy with work and, um,
with something ...

12:44.700 --> 12:48.800
...else that I should probably
tell you about in person.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.600
I mean, I don't even know if
you're in town or...

12:52.600 --> 12:55.200
...if you're checking your messages.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.900
But, um...

12:57.900 --> 13:02.200
But I really need to see you
and talk to you.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.800
There's a lot of stuff that's going on
with me right now and, um...

13:06.800 --> 13:10.300
...and I just really need to talk.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.600
Mom?

13:37.800 --> 13:41.400
<i>- John Doggett.
- You stay out of my business!</i>

13:41.800 --> 13:44.900
- What? Who is this?
- You better have a court order!

13:44.900 --> 13:49.000
<i>- For what? Who is this?
- How many phones are you tapping?</i>

13:49.000 --> 13:51.800
<i>How many agents are you
doing surveillance on?</i>

13:51.800 --> 13:53.700
Is this Agent Scully?

13:53.700 --> 13:57.400
Thank you. You just answered
all my questions.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.400
Stop there! Right there!

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
Now come on through the
window nice and easy.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.600
Okay, I'm coming.
It's me, your landlord.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.100
I started fixing the
antennae on the roof, and...

15:01.100 --> 15:05.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Coeben.
I'm sorry. There was a man.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.800
There was someone in the building.
Did you see anyone?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.200
Yeah, yeah, you know him,
he works with you.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.100
Tall guy-- brown hair.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.000
Who?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.500
- You don't mean Mulder?
- Yeah, Mulder.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.600
Mulder?

15:27.500 --> 15:30.100
Are you in here?

18:26.500 --> 18:29.900
- It took some serious voodoo.
- Major satellite hacking.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.300
- But we got your data.
- What am I looking at?

18:32.300 --> 18:36.500
You're seeing real-time images right
off the JPL Topex Poseidon.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.000
We're wired right into the dish.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.900
We're not able to find raw data
with UFO activity on it.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.700
But Langly was able to hack into
the data storage here...

18:44.700 --> 18:47.000
...and pull up something
just as tasty.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
You're looking at UFO activity in the
Pacific Northwest just prior to Mulder's abduction.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.100
All these markers correspond with
reported alien abductions.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.000
- It's a regular shopping spree.
- So Mulder's abduction...

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Was a UFO whistle stop on the
way to the next pickup.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.200
Where? Where's the UFO activity
after Mulder's abduction?

19:05.200 --> 19:08.100
Like we said, we can't tell.
Not from the data we're pulling down.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.400
Look, if we can figure out where
that ship was going, ...

19:10.400 --> 19:15.400
...where it was gonna be,
we've got a chance to find Mulder.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.200
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

19:27.400 --> 19:32.400
- You fly, Agent Doggett?
- Flying is for birds and baseballs. USMC, sir.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.400
In Vietnam we used to fly night
sorties ten feet above the treetops.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.700
Before night vision,
before fly-by-wire.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.600
600 miles an hour and all we had
was an idiot gauge and our wits.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.800
Guys used to say they only knew their
altitude by the smell of the V.C. rice pots.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.200
You've come a long way, sir.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.400
Using all the same instincts.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.200
What can I do for you, Agent?

19:59.200 --> 20:04.300
This task force-- the search for Mulder,
I'm running it, right?

20:04.300 --> 20:07.700
- You're the man in charge.
- No one else is involved?

20:07.700 --> 20:10.700
Someone out there acting under
orders from another office?

20:10.700 --> 20:15.600
I think I'd know, Agent.
What prompts the question?

20:15.600 --> 20:20.100
My idiot gauge. My wits.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.800
You got a chance to shine here, John.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.700
Stand in the spotlight.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.700
Show them all you're an ace.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.400
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.400
- I came by to feed Mulder's fish.
- And then you got tired and decided...

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
...to take a nap.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.500
You've got a way about you,
Agent Doggett.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
That might have worked with the NYPD...

21:16.500 --> 21:20.500
...but you're talking to a fellow FBI agent
now and I'd appreciate some respect.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.200
Respect like you showed me
over the phone?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.500
Give a little, get a little, Agent Scully.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.300
Who ambushed me with the phony chitchat
about Mulder and then...

21:28.300 --> 21:31.000
- ...put a wiretap on my phone?
- That's B.S.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And now you're following me.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.400
I just came by to feed the fish.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.000
What do you want to get on me,
Agent Doggett?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
What is it you hope to find?

21:48.400 --> 21:51.000
I'm just trying to find Mulder.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.700
You wouldn't know where to look.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.900
It's in the desk, middle drawer.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.500
I know the answer, Agent Scully.

22:06.500 --> 22:10.200
- I don't even know the question.
- What happened to Mulder?

22:10.200 --> 22:15.700
I know what you're gonna say or not
because you think I'm the big bad wolf.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.200
Do you really believe it?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.500
You think by talking in circles,
I'm just going to get dizzy and...

22:19.500 --> 22:22.100
...and blurt it out--
this so-called answer?

22:22.100 --> 22:26.600
- That he was abducted by aliens?
- You said it. I didn't.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.300
I guess I just find it hard
to swallow that a scientist, ...

22:29.300 --> 22:32.600
...a serious person, could buy that.

22:34.700 --> 22:38.700
Ever see an alien, Agent Scully?

22:39.700 --> 22:42.900
You want me to go on record?

22:43.600 --> 22:46.900
I will go on record to say this:

22:46.900 --> 22:50.200
that I have seen things
that I cannot explain.

22:50.200 --> 22:54.200
I have observed phenomena
that I cannot deny.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.100
And that as a scientist and
a serious person...

22:57.100 --> 22:59.800
...it is a badge of honor not
to dismiss these things...

22:59.800 --> 23:02.900
...because someone thinks
they're B.S.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.400
So you think he was abducted?

23:07.900 --> 23:12.700
- I'm just trying to find him.
- Then what are you doing here?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.300
Trying to figure these out.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.600
I found them in his desk there.

23:18.600 --> 23:22.000
Car rental receipts on
Agent Mulder's Visa.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.600
Four consecutive weekends in May.
Same mileage each trip--

23:25.600 --> 23:29.300
370 miles, 375 miles...

23:29.300 --> 23:31.800
Where was he going?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.800
I don't know.

23:36.400 --> 23:41.700
Like I said, maybe you really
didn't know your partner.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.000
John Doggett.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.000
Agent Mulder at the FBI?

24:12.100 --> 24:15.100
Assistant Director, follow me.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.000
- What's going on?  What is this?
- Mr. Skinner, right this way, please.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.500
You can talk with Agent
Scully after we're done.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
Have a seat.

24:37.300 --> 24:41.200
Assistant Director, someone came into this office
after hours and removed some material.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.000
Files. We don't know exactly
what just yet.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.400
Who?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.300
The office here is secured by a pass-card lock...

24:52.300 --> 24:56.700
...and whoever came in last night used
the pass-card belonging to Agent Mulder.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.600
You think Agent Mulder took the files?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.800
We're wondering about
Agent Mulder's state of mind.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.800
In your statement,
you said prior to his disappearance...

25:05.800 --> 25:10.100
...Agent Mulder had felt
threatened by the FBI.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.400
No, that's not what I said.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.900
I said he felt the X-Files were
threatened by budget cutting.

25:15.900 --> 25:21.800
Is there anything you're not telling us
about Agent Mulder or his attitude?

25:21.800 --> 25:26.200
Do you think he'd ever
retaliate against the FBI?

25:28.700 --> 25:34.500
- Agent Mulder was only after the truth.
- As are we, Assistant Director.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.300
Agent Scully tells us
she was home last night.

25:40.300 --> 25:45.700
We see from your phone log,
you were here until at least after 10:00.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.100
You think I came in here last night
using Agent Mulder's pass-card?

26:09.100 --> 26:11.600
You were the last person to
see Mulder.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.500
You and Agent Scully.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.000
Skinner is telling the truth.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.800
I believe him.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.200
That still doesn't tell us who
used Mulder's card to get in there.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.300
You think it was Mulder?

26:43.300 --> 26:45.900
I showed you those car
rental receipts.

26:45.900 --> 26:50.500
Well, now I find Agent Mulder's Visa was used
two days ago in Raleigh, North Carolina.

26:50.500 --> 26:55.400
Two days ago?
By who? For what?

26:55.400 --> 27:01.000
Flowers. Automatic debit to
a mortuary there.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.600
Mulder's mother is buried
in Raleigh.

27:08.600 --> 27:13.100
That's the reason he was
going every weekend.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.500
It's one reason.

28:31.900 --> 28:35.400
I don't know what to think.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.700
I don't believe it, Dana.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.700
All right.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.000
I got some light on this.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.800
Maybe you can help me out here,
Agent Scully.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.700
What is it?

28:52.700 --> 28:56.800
Agent Mulder's medical records--
recent stuff, over the last year.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.800
Did you know about a medical
condition? Either of you?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.700
No.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.900
A year ago, Agent Mulder was
hospitalized. Ring a bell?

29:07.900 --> 29:09.900
Something to do with his brain?

29:09.900 --> 29:13.900
- His temporal lobe.
- An undiagnosable condition, it says.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.100
Irregular brain activity.

29:16.100 --> 29:19.500
All right, but he recovered.
There was a full recovery.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.600
Was there?

29:23.800 --> 29:26.700
You know Mulder; he would've
told us if there was anything.

29:26.700 --> 29:29.200
Would he?

29:29.200 --> 29:33.600
Would he tell you about this?
About his headstone?

29:35.800 --> 29:38.800
Mulder was dying.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.500
- What?
- It's all right here.

29:41.500 --> 29:47.500
For a year, he was going to doctors.
There's a clear record of his decline.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.800
How well did you really know him?

29:54.400 --> 29:59.000
- How far would Mulder go?
- How far would he go for what?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.300
The truth-- his truth.

30:01.300 --> 30:06.600
Whatever it was he was trying to prove,
how bad did he need to prove it?

30:06.600 --> 30:10.100
- It was his whole life.
- What are you trying to say?

30:10.100 --> 30:14.000
That Agent Mulder found himself
in a place none of us want to go.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.100
Life-threatened, work-threatened,
and all for naught.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.600
Nothing proven.

30:19.600 --> 30:25.000
The effort in vain.
No mark left.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.700
Unless he rolled the dice,
took one big last chance to make it.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.200
You think that Mulder was here?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.500
That he broke in to
steal those files?

30:40.500 --> 30:43.000
Broke into your apartment;
stole your computer.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.300
Took his own computer.
Gathering it up.

30:47.300 --> 30:51.400
To what?
To prove it?

30:51.400 --> 30:55.400
Or cover it up.
Create doubt.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.100
I get Mulder, I get him.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.600
I understand obsession,
believe me.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.900
But the question is:
how far would he go?

31:03.900 --> 31:08.600
I mean, so far as to stage his
own disappearance?

31:12.600 --> 31:15.700
I know what I saw.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.100
I not going to sit here
and listen to this.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.800
I watched it happen.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.500
Agent Mulder?!

31:48.900 --> 31:52.300
Please don't report that.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.400
Don't know what good it
would do me.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.600
Doesn't help me find Mulder.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.500
No, it's not good enough.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.300
These are records of
microburst activity.

32:25.300 --> 32:28.300
What we read is UFO activity
since Mulder's abduction.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.500
- I think this is a waste of time.
- No, it's not. Just look at them.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.700
I'm looking, and what I'm seeing is
activity all over the southwestern states.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.400
That's right.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.000
Mulder disappeared in the
Pacific Northwest.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
And if Mulder is on that ship,
this is where he is now.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.600
Here?
In the Arizona desert?

32:49.600 --> 32:52.600
This is what we have.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.700
Okay. Say this is true...

33:01.700 --> 33:05.700
Then how do we even
begin to start finding him?

33:14.900 --> 33:19.800
Maybe with whoever it is they're
looking to abduct next.

33:20.200 --> 33:24.500
- Hey, we're only trying to help.
- We're only trying to find Mulder.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.900
That's it.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.200
- It just came to me.
- What?

33:34.200 --> 33:37.400
What you saw,
why they took Mulder, ...

33:37.400 --> 33:40.800
...why they're in Arizona now--
it all makes sense.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.700
<i>Why do people refuse to believe
in aliens and UFOs...</i>

33:44.700 --> 33:49.400
<i>...after all these years of sightings
and eyewitness accounts?</i>

33:51.200 --> 33:54.000
<i>- Why?
- Because there's no real proof.</i>

33:54.000 --> 33:57.600
Because, maybe, if there are aliens
they're simply going around...

33:57.600 --> 34:01.900
...and they're... and they're removing
all of the evidence before it becomes proof.

34:01.900 --> 34:06.700
<i>This isn't Mulder who's going around
and collecting this stuff. It's them.</i>

34:06.700 --> 34:08.500
<i>Then why Arizona?</i>

34:08.500 --> 34:12.300
Because they are looking to find that
which is not in my computer...

34:12.300 --> 34:16.699
...or Mulder's computer or in the files
that were removed from the FBI.

34:16.699 --> 34:20.800
They are looking to find the whereabouts
of good, hard proof.

34:20.800 --> 34:24.600
<i>That in this case exists in a person, ...</i>

34:24.600 --> 34:28.800
<i>...in a boy named Gibson Praise.</i>

34:52.300 --> 34:55.100
This photograph's a few years old
but take a good look because...

34:55.100 --> 34:59.100
...the objective in this case
has been reframed.

34:59.100 --> 35:02.000
Subject's name is Gibson Andrew Praise.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.500
A child prodigy, pint-sized chess
champion who Mulder and Scully...

35:06.500 --> 35:12.400
...first investigated in 1997 after
a failed attempt on the boy's life.

35:12.400 --> 35:17.900
His files were the ones we now believe
were stolen from this office.

35:17.900 --> 35:21.800
In his investigation Agent Mulder
came to believe the boy...

35:21.800 --> 35:25.700
...was experiencing abnormal
brain activity.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.500
Unexplained activity.

35:28.500 --> 35:33.400
In his field notes here he says
Gibson Praise could, and I quote:

35:33.400 --> 35:37.000
"read people's thoughts."

35:37.000 --> 35:39.200
Agent Mulder went so far in one
report to claim...

35:39.200 --> 35:44.100
...that the boy may have
alien physiology.

35:44.500 --> 35:49.500
Agent Mulder may be looking for the boy
who was last seen in Arizona.

35:49.500 --> 35:55.100
So maybe to find Mulder we first have
to look for Gibson Praise.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.400
Let's go, people!
Let's move!

36:01.300 --> 36:03.000
How do you want this handled?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.800
I want you to put that
on every TV station, ...

36:04.800 --> 36:09.400
...post office, and fax machine
in Arizona and the southwest.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.000
I want to make that face famous.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.500
You better?

37:20.500 --> 37:23.600
I need some navigation.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.500
How to start looking for a 12-year-old kid
in the middle of the Arizona desert.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.400
Well, there aren't a whole
lot of choices.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.700
We got a turn off coming up in five miles.
I take it or keep going straight?

37:38.700 --> 37:40.900
Gibson Praise was last seen here...

37:40.900 --> 37:44.900
...at a power plant about
60 miles outside of Phoenix.

37:44.900 --> 37:50.300
But all the satellite data shows activity
here about 100 miles to the north.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.300
What's out there?

37:52.300 --> 37:55.600
Well, according to this map...

37:55.600 --> 37:58.600
...a whole lot of nothing.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.200
<i>This is Special Agent Crane
calling for task force leader.</i>

38:23.200 --> 38:24.500
Yeah, this is John Doggett.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.700
<i>Just confirmed a location
on this kid.</i>

38:26.700 --> 38:30.100
He's at a school for the deaf
in a place called Flemingtown.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.400
<i>Little dot on the map about
90 miles from where I am now.</i>

38:33.400 --> 38:35.300
I just talked to the school
principal there.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.000
- Is the kid in school now?
- Yeah, he lives at the school.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.300
All right, have the principal
take him out of class and...

38:40.300 --> 38:43.100
...put him someplace where he can
keep an eye on him until we arrive.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.000
Got it. Gonna take me an hour,
an hour and 15 to get there.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.400
All right, well, I'm going to see
if I can cut some time off that.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.300
It's a school 20 minutes from here.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.800
Yes, sir, in his science class.

39:43.200 --> 39:47.200
Is it important enough to take
him away from his studies?

39:47.200 --> 39:50.300
I'll go and get him
right now.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.800
FLEMINGTOWN
School for the Deaf

41:13.100 --> 41:14.400
Where's the boy?

41:14.400 --> 41:17.700
You're just going to have to slow down and
explain a few things to us before we let you...

41:17.700 --> 41:20.800
- Is he down there?
- He's in my office.

41:24.800 --> 41:28.000
Hi. Um ... we're looking for a
boy named Gibson Praise.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.700
- Now who are you?
- Kid went out the window.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.300
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?!

41:33.300 --> 41:35.500
Trying to find Mulder.

41:40.500 --> 41:43.000
Kid's on the move.
Spread out!

41:44.500 --> 41:49.500
The kid's on the loose!
You have the photo! Move!

42:45.300 --> 42:47.600
Let me go!

42:48.200 --> 42:49.800
Let me go!

42:49.800 --> 42:52.300
Let the boy go!

42:53.400 --> 42:56.400
Let him go, Mulder!

43:01.000 --> 43:04.900
