00:02.209 --> 00:04.336
When you ask for the doggy bag
in a restaurant...

00:05.913 --> 00:07.244
...there's a sense of failure.

00:07.415 --> 00:11.181
People always whisper it
to the waiter, "Excuse me...

00:11.419 --> 00:15.116
...l'm sorry, you're gonna have
to give me the doggy bag.

00:15.289 --> 00:17.189
I couldn't make it."

00:17.658 --> 00:20.092
It is embarrassing because
a doggy bag means either...

00:20.261 --> 00:22.729
...you were at a restaurant
when you're not hungry...

00:22.897 --> 00:27.800
...or you've chosen the stupidest
way to get dog food that there is.

00:27.969 --> 00:30.335
How about the doggy bag
on a date?

00:30.504 --> 00:32.028
That's a good move for a guy, huh?

00:32.206 --> 00:35.573
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you
ask for the doggy bag on a date...

00:35.743 --> 00:39.008
...you might as well have them
just wrap up your genitals too.

00:39.180 --> 00:42.172
You're not gonna be needing
those for a while either.

00:53.661 --> 00:56.357
- Is that bothering you?
- No. Not at all.

00:57.965 --> 00:59.262
It's the BMW.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.458
Oh, could you please hurry?

01:02.303 --> 01:03.930
"Please hurry."

01:04.105 --> 01:06.300
Look at you.
Look what you've become.

01:06.474 --> 01:09.136
What? What have I become?
I haven't become anything.

01:09.310 --> 01:11.005
Oh, Carl can't wait a few...

01:11.178 --> 01:13.669
...more minutes?
- I don't want to keep him waiting.

01:13.848 --> 01:17.045
- He'll like you more.
- That's impossible.

01:17.418 --> 01:19.852
Stan, why do you have to
pick your teeth at the table?

01:20.021 --> 01:22.717
- Leave me alone.
- It's disgusting.

01:22.923 --> 01:26.051
Yeah, I'm gonna get married
real soon.

01:26.227 --> 01:29.162
- So where am I dropping you?
- His place.

01:29.764 --> 01:31.891
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner...

01:32.066 --> 01:33.590
...then drop you at his apartment.

01:33.768 --> 01:36.328
And he gets the rest of my chicken.

01:37.672 --> 01:39.503
So is tonight the night?

01:39.674 --> 01:41.039
You never know.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.267
Baby doll.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.776
Thank you, brother.

02:03.264 --> 02:04.822
What, do you smell something?

02:04.999 --> 02:07.900
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

02:08.068 --> 02:10.469
- Of course I smell something.
- What is it?

02:11.972 --> 02:13.940
I think its BO.

02:15.543 --> 02:16.908
What?

02:17.912 --> 02:21.143
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.

02:21.849 --> 02:24.818
It can't be. Nobody has BO like this.

02:24.985 --> 02:28.318
Jerry, its BO.

02:28.489 --> 02:30.582
But the whole car smells.

02:30.758 --> 02:33.318
- So?
- So when somebody has BO...

02:33.494 --> 02:35.826
...the O usually stays with the B.

02:35.996 --> 02:37.930
Once the B leaves,
the O goes with it.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.740
Oh, my God.

02:52.113 --> 02:55.139
- I can't believe you ski.
- I'm a great skier.

02:55.316 --> 02:56.613
Yeah, what else?

02:56.784 --> 02:59.753
Let's see. I ski, I fish...

02:59.920 --> 03:01.581
...I pillage, I plunder.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.091
- You pillage and plunder?
- When I travel.

03:06.260 --> 03:09.593
See, finally, finally I get
to meet a man...

03:09.764 --> 03:13.495
...who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.

03:25.546 --> 03:28.447
- It should only take a second.
- Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.

03:35.022 --> 03:37.252
Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.

03:37.424 --> 03:39.824
A lesbian sighting.

03:39.994 --> 03:41.552
My lucky day.

03:41.729 --> 03:45.062
They're so fascinating. Why is that?

03:45.232 --> 03:47.325
Because they don't want us.

03:48.035 --> 03:50.003
You gotta respect that.

03:50.638 --> 03:52.230
Oh, my God.

03:52.406 --> 03:55.534
It's Susan! But what do I do?

03:55.943 --> 03:57.638
George?

03:58.479 --> 04:01.607
- Susan. Hi.
- Hi.

04:01.882 --> 04:03.941
Oh, boy.

04:04.585 --> 04:05.984
What are you doing here?

04:06.153 --> 04:08.348
- Renting a video.
- Right.

04:08.522 --> 04:09.784
What do you got there?

04:09.957 --> 04:12.585
Oh, some... some stupid movie.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.092
This is Mona.

04:15.863 --> 04:17.387
Hi.

04:18.565 --> 04:21.329
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes. Well...

04:21.502 --> 04:24.232
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

04:28.175 --> 04:30.507
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yes.

04:30.678 --> 04:32.839
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.

04:33.013 --> 04:35.880
And you didn't expect me to be
holding hands with a woman.

04:36.350 --> 04:38.875
Oh, please. Me?

04:39.053 --> 04:41.283
Come on, that's great.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.889
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.

04:44.058 --> 04:46.049
I've always encouraged
experimentation.

04:46.227 --> 04:50.254
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?

04:50.431 --> 04:53.127
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Of course you do.

04:54.001 --> 04:58.199
It's just, you know,
I never knew that...

04:58.372 --> 05:00.567
- I like women?
- There you go.

05:01.775 --> 05:04.972
So how long has this
been going on?

05:06.046 --> 05:07.775
Since you and I broke up.

05:10.985 --> 05:15.081
So after me, you...

05:15.256 --> 05:16.883
...went that way?

05:17.858 --> 05:19.655
Yeah.

05:19.827 --> 05:23.160
I think that's fantastic. Good for you.

05:23.330 --> 05:25.628
Nice. That's very nice.

05:31.138 --> 05:32.901
- So, what do you got there?
- I don't...

05:33.974 --> 05:37.102
- Rochelle, Rochelle.
- Yeah.

05:37.278 --> 05:41.078
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.

05:41.248 --> 05:43.716
- A lot of nudity in that, huh?
- No, no, just a tiny bit.

05:43.884 --> 05:45.374
It's not even frontal nudity.

05:45.552 --> 05:48.282
It's "sidal" nudity.

05:48.689 --> 05:50.281
Next.

05:50.591 --> 05:52.183
- That's me.
- Good seeing you, George.

05:52.359 --> 05:53.826
Yes, good to see you too.

05:53.994 --> 05:55.586
And good luck with...

05:55.763 --> 05:57.754
With the whole thing there.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.532
What are you returning?

06:03.904 --> 06:05.132
Rochelle, Rochelle.

06:05.306 --> 06:07.433
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange...

06:07.608 --> 06:10.133
...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:10.444 --> 06:13.072
That'll be $3.49.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.942
Three forty-nine? It says $ 1.49.

06:15.115 --> 06:17.845
You didn't rewind it. There's
a $2 charge for not rewinding.

06:18.018 --> 06:19.781
But there's no signs here.

06:19.954 --> 06:22.821
- This is an outrage.
- Don't give him any money for that.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.891
It'll cost you less to keep it
another day, rewind it...

06:26.060 --> 06:29.723
...and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

06:30.397 --> 06:32.831
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.729
I'm gonna watch it again.

06:35.069 --> 06:36.764
How could that hurt?

06:38.472 --> 06:41.635
So this morning I go down
to the garage to check the car out.

06:41.809 --> 06:44.778
I figure by this time,
the odor molecules have had...

06:44.945 --> 06:48.039
...at least 12 hours to "de-smellify."
- Right.

06:48.215 --> 06:50.445
I open the car door...

06:50.617 --> 06:53.108
...like a punch in the face...

06:53.620 --> 06:55.144
...the stench hits me.

06:55.322 --> 06:58.519
It's almost as if it had gained strength
throughout the night.

06:58.692 --> 07:01.855
You know, I can think of at least
six known offensive odors...

07:02.029 --> 07:05.055
...that I would rather smell
than what's living in your car.

07:05.232 --> 07:07.325
- What about skunk?
- I don't mind skunk.

07:07.501 --> 07:10.095
- Horse manure?
- I love horse manure.

07:12.206 --> 07:14.333
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

07:14.508 --> 07:16.100
In fact, I went to the car wash...

07:16.276 --> 07:19.939
...they want $250 to detail it
and get the smell out.

07:20.647 --> 07:23.172
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.

07:23.350 --> 07:26.217
I'm driving to that restaurant,
and demand they pay for it.

07:26.387 --> 07:28.116
Absolutely.

07:29.023 --> 07:31.856
Listen, let me ask you something.

07:32.126 --> 07:36.290
When you're with a guy and he
tells you he has to get up early...

07:36.463 --> 07:39.227
...what does that mean?
- It means he's lying.

07:42.736 --> 07:46.433
- Why, is that what he told you?
- Yeah. Last night.

07:46.607 --> 07:49.576
Oh, come on. Men have to
get up early sometime.

07:49.743 --> 07:51.802
No. Never.

07:51.979 --> 07:55.938
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on
the street early in the morning.

07:56.116 --> 07:58.311
Well, sometimes we do
have to get up early...

07:58.485 --> 08:00.476
...but a man will always
trade sleep for sex.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.555
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

08:04.992 --> 08:06.459
Anything's possible.

08:10.197 --> 08:11.664
Yeah.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.199
- What's the matter with you?
- Steinbrenner!

08:15.369 --> 08:17.269
- He's ruining my life.
- Oh, yes.

08:17.438 --> 08:20.134
- Steinbrenner.
- I can't take another season with him.

08:20.307 --> 08:22.400
He just traded away
their best prospects...

08:22.576 --> 08:26.068
...just like he did with Buhner,
McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.

08:26.246 --> 08:27.770
I know the list.

08:28.615 --> 08:30.583
What's that smell?

08:30.751 --> 08:32.446
What...? What smell?

08:35.289 --> 08:36.916
You stink.

08:39.259 --> 08:41.250
- What do you mean, I stink?
- You stink.

08:41.428 --> 08:43.760
- Why don't you take a shower.
- I showered.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.763
Oh, wait a second.

08:45.933 --> 08:48.595
Since I showered, I've been in the car.

08:48.769 --> 08:51.397
- So?
- Don't you see what's happening?

08:51.572 --> 08:54.200
It's attached itself to me. It's alive.

08:54.374 --> 08:57.901
If it's attached itself to you...

08:58.212 --> 08:59.873
Oh, my God.

09:00.047 --> 09:04.143
That's why Carl said he had to
get up early, because I stink.

09:04.485 --> 09:07.147
Jerry, he thinks I have BO. Me.

09:08.388 --> 09:10.117
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.258
- It's George.
- I'm coming right down.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.257
- All right, what happened?
- What happened?

09:14.428 --> 09:16.658
My car stinks is what happened.

09:16.830 --> 09:20.163
And it's destroying the lives
of everyone in its path.

09:24.271 --> 09:26.796
- This is BO?
- Yes.

09:26.974 --> 09:28.965
- This is unbelievable BO.
- I know.

09:29.143 --> 09:31.941
At the car wash, the guy told me
in 38 years in the business...

09:32.112 --> 09:34.740
...he's never smelled anything like it.

09:34.915 --> 09:37.884
So let me ask you, do you think
I could've done this?

09:38.051 --> 09:40.178
No, no. It's the valet guy.

09:40.354 --> 09:43.414
No, no. I mean, driven Susan
to lesbianism.

09:43.590 --> 09:45.683
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

09:45.859 --> 09:48.453
What if her experience with me
drove her to it.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.824
Suicide, maybe. Not lesbianism.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.761
The woman she was
"lesbianing" with...

09:52.933 --> 09:55.834
...Susan told me she's never
been with a guy.

09:56.803 --> 10:00.933
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO. It's BBO.

10:01.108 --> 10:03.906
There should be a BO squad
that patrols the city...

10:04.077 --> 10:07.410
...to sniff them out, strip them down
and wash them with a soapy brush.

10:07.581 --> 10:12.985
The funny thing is, somehow
I find her more appealing now.

10:13.187 --> 10:15.655
Like, if I knew she was
a lesbian when we went out...

10:15.822 --> 10:18.120
...I never would've
broken up with her.

10:18.292 --> 10:19.782
Let me see if I understand this.

10:21.828 --> 10:23.591
On second thought...

10:27.234 --> 10:29.600
Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.

10:29.770 --> 10:31.203
No, thank you. Go back.

10:31.371 --> 10:32.668
No, go back.

10:32.839 --> 10:34.636
No, back, back.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.777
Go back. I got it. I'll park it.

10:37.945 --> 10:40.709
I'll park it. Go back. You go back.

10:40.881 --> 10:43.941
Sorry. Thank you.
Thank you, no.

10:44.117 --> 10:47.211
What do you mean "stunk up"?

10:47.387 --> 10:49.014
I mean the car stinks.

10:49.189 --> 10:50.451
George, does the car stink?

10:50.624 --> 10:52.114
- Stinks.
- Stinks.

10:52.292 --> 10:54.556
Well, perhaps you're the one
who has the odor.

10:54.728 --> 10:56.753
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.

10:56.930 --> 11:00.058
- Really? Well, I can smell you now.
- That's from the car.

11:00.234 --> 11:03.067
Maybe you stunk up the car,
rather than the car stinking up you.

11:03.237 --> 11:05.797
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.265
Thank you very much.

11:08.442 --> 11:11.240
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.

11:11.411 --> 11:13.845
I don't have time to smell cars.

11:14.014 --> 11:15.743
Forget about smelling the car.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.907
Smell the valet. Go to the source.

11:18.085 --> 11:20.815
- You gotta smell the car.
- I'm a busy man.

11:20.988 --> 11:22.319
Come on. One whiff.

11:23.991 --> 11:25.686
All right. One whiff.

11:31.999 --> 11:34.263
All right. I give up. I admit it, it stinks.

11:34.434 --> 11:35.662
Now could you let me out?

11:35.836 --> 11:39.067
- Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
- Yes, $50. I'll give you $50.

11:39.239 --> 11:42.436
- Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
- Whatever you want.

11:42.609 --> 11:45.407
- I'll give you whatever you want!
- I want half, 125.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.776
Yes! Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!

11:48.949 --> 11:51.110
- All right.
- Let me out of here!

11:53.453 --> 11:55.353
- Oh, my God.
- What?

11:55.522 --> 11:58.616
The video. Someone stole
the video right out of the car.

11:58.792 --> 12:01.818
- Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
- Well, you left the window open.

12:01.995 --> 12:03.326
We had to air out the car.

12:03.497 --> 12:06.261
- You should pay for it.
- I'm not paying for that.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.424
They already got my $ 7.

12:08.602 --> 12:12.402
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

12:14.508 --> 12:20.743
- The valet had such bad BO?
- Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.

12:20.914 --> 12:25.146
The O went from the valet's B
to the car to me.

12:25.319 --> 12:29.722
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.

12:32.092 --> 12:34.993
But I showered,
and I shampooed. So...

12:35.162 --> 12:38.029
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.496
- What?
- It's still there.

12:42.669 --> 12:45.229
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed. I rinsed.

12:45.405 --> 12:47.396
- I repeated.
- It's still there. I smelled it.

12:47.574 --> 12:49.508
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.

12:49.676 --> 12:50.938
- No. No.
- No, here, just...

12:51.111 --> 12:52.738
Please!

12:54.281 --> 12:55.612
Which movie was that again?

12:55.782 --> 12:57.306
Rochelle, Rochelle.

12:57.484 --> 12:59.008
George.

12:59.186 --> 13:00.619
Hey. Thanks for meeting me here.

13:00.787 --> 13:04.382
- Yeah, I don't have much time.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you...

13:04.658 --> 13:06.785
...I was a little concerned that...

13:06.960 --> 13:11.260
...perhaps I was responsible
in some way for your...

13:11.765 --> 13:13.926
...metamorphosis.

13:15.869 --> 13:18.030
That'll be $98.

13:18.205 --> 13:19.797
What $98?

13:19.973 --> 13:21.372
That's what I said, $98.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.739
How could that piece
of crap cost $98?

13:24.911 --> 13:26.902
- George, I really have...
- Do you believe this?

13:27.080 --> 13:29.275
Ninety-eight dollars!

13:31.551 --> 13:32.779
Do you have any cash?

13:32.953 --> 13:34.818
I guess.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.957
I need, like, 35. Thanks.

13:38.492 --> 13:40.619
So was it me?

13:40.794 --> 13:44.730
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Is that what
you wanted to talk to me about?

13:44.898 --> 13:46.263
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

13:46.433 --> 13:49.664
- Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, sure.

13:49.903 --> 13:52.303
- I gotta go.
- Listen.

13:52.472 --> 13:54.269
Let me ask you something:

13:55.175 --> 13:58.542
If you and Mona were ever
to dance...

13:58.812 --> 14:01.610
...how do you decide who leads?

14:01.982 --> 14:04.246
I mean, do you take turns?

14:04.418 --> 14:07.251
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?

14:07.788 --> 14:09.016
You're an idiot.

14:10.991 --> 14:14.119
Why? That's a legitimate
sociological question.

14:14.294 --> 14:15.522
- I'll see you.
- But...

14:15.695 --> 14:18.220
Oh, and George, by the way...

14:18.398 --> 14:21.663
...you stink. You need a bath.

14:21.835 --> 14:23.962
It's not me! It's the car!

14:29.142 --> 14:30.973
I didn't think I'd come.

14:31.144 --> 14:32.771
I knew you would.

14:33.580 --> 14:36.242
- Oh, Mona.
- Oh, Kramer.

14:40.821 --> 14:43.381
You can give it the executive
treatment. That includes...

14:43.557 --> 14:46.253
...complete deionization
of the entire vehicle.

14:46.426 --> 14:50.624
Where we spray everything
with Ozium-D, let it deionize...

14:50.797 --> 14:54.062
...vacuum the spray out
with a deionizing machine.

14:54.234 --> 14:56.293
Hit it with high-pressure
compressed air...

14:56.470 --> 14:59.303
...and wet-dry vac it to extract
the remaining liquids.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.534
And we top it off with
one of our seven air fresheners.

15:02.709 --> 15:07.476
In your case, I would recommend
the jasmine or the potpourri.

15:08.715 --> 15:10.342
Let's do it.

15:12.919 --> 15:14.784
The first thing that we're gonna do...

15:14.955 --> 15:18.152
...is flush the follicles
with the five essential oils.

15:18.758 --> 15:22.319
Then we put you under a vapor
machine, and then a heated cap.

15:22.496 --> 15:24.930
Then we shampoo and shampoo...

15:25.098 --> 15:26.588
...and condition and condition.

15:27.701 --> 15:29.896
Then we saturate the hair...

15:30.070 --> 15:31.594
...in diluted vinegar.

15:31.771 --> 15:36.538
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work...

15:36.710 --> 15:39.110
...we have one last resort.

15:39.279 --> 15:40.712
Tomato sauce.

15:42.516 --> 15:44.643
Tomato sauce?

16:00.967 --> 16:02.730
Thanks a lot.

16:13.313 --> 16:14.905
Wait a minute.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.207
It still smells.

16:17.384 --> 16:19.318
It still smells!

16:22.188 --> 16:24.281
It still smells.

16:26.059 --> 16:27.651
It still smells.

16:27.827 --> 16:31.422
- How could it still smell after all that?
- I don't know.

16:31.598 --> 16:34.658
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.961
- You're selling the car?
- You don't understand...

16:37.137 --> 16:39.605
...what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful...

16:39.773 --> 16:41.434
...than anything you can imagine.

16:41.641 --> 16:45.168
Even Superman would be helpless
against this kind of stench.

16:46.212 --> 16:48.112
And I'll take anything I can get for it.

16:48.281 --> 16:49.612
Maybe I'll buy it.

16:51.351 --> 16:52.613
Are you crazy?

16:52.786 --> 16:54.720
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?

16:54.888 --> 16:58.415
This isn't just an odor. You need
a priest to get rid of this thing.

16:59.459 --> 17:02.326
- I still smell.
- You see?

17:02.495 --> 17:06.431
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence. It's the beast.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.325
All right, let me smell you.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.333
Kramer. Kramer!

17:11.503 --> 17:14.701
- What's that? What's going on?
- Kramer open up, I know you're there!

17:14.874 --> 17:16.501
- Susan.
- Kramer!

17:16.675 --> 17:19.304
- What is going on?
- You know what's going on?

17:19.479 --> 17:21.674
First, he vomits on me.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.646
Then he burns down
my father's cabin.

17:24.818 --> 17:27.150
And now he's taken
Mona away from me.

17:27.319 --> 17:30.050
- He stole your girlfriend?
- Yes.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.056
She's in love with him.

17:35.195 --> 17:36.560
Amazing.

17:36.730 --> 17:39.221
I drive them to lesbianism,
he brings them back.

17:49.275 --> 17:50.503
Hello.

17:50.677 --> 17:53.077
- She still there?
- No. She left.

17:53.246 --> 17:57.012
- What is going on? What did you do?
- I don't know, I didn't do anything.

17:57.183 --> 18:01.517
I was in the video store, and I was
practicing my golf swing, you know.

18:01.688 --> 18:03.679
You know, with a broom, and...

18:03.857 --> 18:07.884
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing,
and she told me...

18:08.061 --> 18:12.725
...that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.

18:12.899 --> 18:16.198
She's a golf teacher. So I went
to a lesson, and, you know...

18:16.369 --> 18:18.929
...something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.

18:19.105 --> 18:23.041
I've struck gold! I've already taken
six strokes off my game.

18:24.878 --> 18:27.745
That's the least of what
you've accomplished.

18:28.448 --> 18:31.315
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?

18:31.518 --> 18:32.746
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

18:32.919 --> 18:35.888
Wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.

18:36.056 --> 18:40.516
This woman has never been
with a man her entire life.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.129
I'm Kramer.

18:47.734 --> 18:50.066
Look, I know what you're
going through.

18:50.236 --> 18:52.796
Women. Who knows what they want?

18:54.441 --> 18:56.409
I just don't know what
she sees in Kramer.

18:56.576 --> 19:00.945
Listen, you're beautiful. You're
intelligent. You'll meet other girls.

19:02.148 --> 19:04.378
- You think so?
- Yes, I know so.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.644
You happen to be
a very eligible lesbian.

19:08.588 --> 19:11.887
- You're very sweet.
- Hey, I know what I'm talking about.

19:12.058 --> 19:14.925
But I gotta be honest with you,
I gotta tell you...

19:15.328 --> 19:18.559
...ever since I saw you holding hands
with that woman...

19:18.898 --> 19:20.661
...I can't get you out of my mind.

19:21.267 --> 19:22.666
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:22.836 --> 19:25.396
You're just so hip.

19:26.773 --> 19:28.138
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:28.308 --> 19:32.472
It's Allison. I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.

19:36.015 --> 19:37.676
George?

19:38.718 --> 19:40.913
Allison. Hi.

19:41.087 --> 19:43.749
- Oh, my God. How are you?
- Good.

19:43.923 --> 19:46.448
You know, you owe me $50.

19:46.626 --> 19:49.186
Fifty dollars, right. Right.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.798
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

19:52.966 --> 19:54.866
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

19:55.935 --> 19:59.632
That's a beautiful vest.

20:00.206 --> 20:01.537
Thank you.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.543
I don't understand it. I was with her
last night at my apartment.

20:10.717 --> 20:12.150
It was very romantic.

20:12.318 --> 20:15.981
With that fake wood wallpaper, the
atmosphere is fabulous in there now.

20:16.156 --> 20:17.487
It's like a ski lodge.

20:17.657 --> 20:19.591
- What year did you say this was?
- Ninety.

20:19.759 --> 20:23.092
We're on the couch. I moved to hug
her, next she tells me she's leaving...

20:23.263 --> 20:25.060
...she's got to get up early.

20:25.231 --> 20:27.893
- That's strange.
- How many miles you got on this?

20:28.067 --> 20:29.295
Twenty-three thousand.

20:29.469 --> 20:30.993
And I was looking good too.

20:31.171 --> 20:33.537
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.

20:34.207 --> 20:36.641
Wait a second. My jacket.

20:36.810 --> 20:39.370
I wore that in the car. The beast.

20:41.247 --> 20:43.408
- This wicked funk.
- What?

20:44.017 --> 20:45.917
I can't sell this car.

20:48.188 --> 20:51.248
This thing.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.415
It's got to be stopped.

20:53.593 --> 20:56.528
- So, what do you want to do?
- Sauce me.

21:41.574 --> 21:43.599
Why do we need BO?

21:43.977 --> 21:45.672
What is the function of it?

21:45.845 --> 21:48.973
Everything in nature has a reason,
has a purpose, except BO.

21:49.148 --> 21:51.810
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good...

21:51.985 --> 21:55.113
...hard work, exercise,
you smell very bad.

21:55.288 --> 21:58.689
This is the way the human being
is designed. You move, you stink.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.286
Why can't our bodies help us?

22:02.462 --> 22:06.592
Why can't sweat smell good?
lt'd be a different world, wouldn't it?

22:06.966 --> 22:09.799
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper, put it in a vase.

22:09.969 --> 22:13.461
Go down to the drug store, pick up
some odorant and perspirant.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.871
Probably have a dirty sock hanging
from the rearview mirror of your car.

22:17.043 --> 22:19.409
Then on a special night,
maybe a little underwear...

22:19.579 --> 22:21.274
...coming out of your breast pocket.

22:21.447 --> 22:23.938
Just to show her that she's important.
