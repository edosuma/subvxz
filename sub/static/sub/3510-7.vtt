WEBVTT

00:04.030 --> 00:06.763
This is outrageous, sir.

00:06.764 --> 00:09.922
Y-you are nothing but a
well-dressed loan shark.

00:09.923 --> 00:11.635
Ms. Rodgers, I assure you,

00:11.636 --> 00:13.912
this is a very competitive interest rate...

00:14.543 --> 00:16.488
...considering your financial history.

00:16.489 --> 00:18.156
However, if your son cosigns--

00:18.157 --> 00:19.362
- Yes.
- No, no, no, no.

00:19.363 --> 00:20.672
This is my loan, not his,

00:20.673 --> 00:23.473
to pay for repairs to my
acting studio, not his.

00:23.474 --> 00:25.740
If you just let me cosign the loan,

00:25.741 --> 00:27.083
or I could just give you the money.

00:27.084 --> 00:29.520
Richard, I'm a businesswoman now.

00:29.521 --> 00:31.549
I do not want your money.
I do not want your signature.

00:31.550 --> 00:32.439
Thank you very much.

00:32.441 --> 00:33.713
It's the principle.

00:33.714 --> 00:35.004
No, Ms. Rodgers,

00:35.005 --> 00:36.424
it's the interest.

00:36.425 --> 00:39.070
And I've just lost mine. Excuse me.

00:40.056 --> 00:42.446
I have $1 million...

00:42.447 --> 00:45.025
Into this now, so...

00:47.956 --> 00:49.373
What do you want, Castle?

00:49.374 --> 00:51.038
Tell me you need me.

00:51.809 --> 00:52.925
Excuse me?

00:52.926 --> 00:54.092
I'm stuck at a bank,

00:54.093 --> 00:56.633
helping my mother get a
loan from my banker.

00:56.634 --> 00:58.300
Please tell me that there's
a murder somewhere

00:58.301 --> 00:59.548
we could be solving.

00:59.549 --> 01:00.220
Uh, sorry,

01:00.221 --> 01:01.923
there is no dead body,
just a lot of paperwork,

01:01.924 --> 01:04.655
which welcome you to come
and do your share for once.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.174
I wonder if it's worse being here or

01:06.175 --> 01:07.606
being there doing paperwork.

01:07.607 --> 01:09.864
You know how can we be partners
when I'm chasing down bad guys,

01:09.865 --> 01:12.622
and as soon as there are paperwork,
I'm on an solo mission?

01:14.331 --> 01:15.382
What?

01:22.315 --> 01:26.218
I think this bank is about to be robbed.

01:26.664 --> 01:28.603
Really? Are you that bored?

01:31.577 --> 01:34.362
There's a man and a woman here

01:34.683 --> 01:36.512
dressed in scrubs,

01:36.890 --> 01:40.758
and both of them have suspicious
bulges in their jackets.

01:41.599 --> 01:43.093
Castle, I think your writer's imagination

01:43.094 --> 01:44.870
is getting away with you.

01:47.157 --> 01:49.160
Everybody, get down on the floor!

01:49.161 --> 01:51.233
It's not my imagination.

01:51.234 --> 01:53.337
It's definitely not my imagination.

01:54.954 --> 01:56.404
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move, move.

01:56.405 --> 01:58.794
Oh my God!

01:58.795 --> 01:59.817
Castle, what's happening?

01:59.818 --> 02:00.952
Oh, my God.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.649
On the floor! Get down! Move, move.

02:02.650 --> 02:03.443
Ok, ok.

02:05.489 --> 02:06.384
Where are you?

02:06.385 --> 02:08.554
I'm at the New Amsterdam
Bank & Trust on Lex.

02:08.555 --> 02:10.066
Esposito, there's a 10-30,

02:10.067 --> 02:11.909
New Amsterdam Bank & Trust on Lex.

02:11.910 --> 02:12.967
Call dispatch.

02:12.968 --> 02:15.591
10-30? Since when we are
handling bank-robbery cause?

02:15.592 --> 02:16.994
Castle's there.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.112
Slide up your cell phones. Now!

02:19.113 --> 02:22.054
- Cell phones.
- Hurry up, now, come on!

02:22.286 --> 02:24.823
Yo, you get that one? Slide that up here.

02:24.988 --> 02:26.603
I said slide up your mobiles!

02:26.604 --> 02:29.909
- Move away from your stations.
- Slide 'em up. Come on.

02:29.944 --> 02:32.746
I'm hiding behind a desk with my mother,

02:32.911 --> 02:34.606
but I can see everything.

02:35.827 --> 02:36.961
They're wearing doctor scrubs.

02:36.962 --> 02:39.100
One of them is emptying the cash drawers.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.392
You, bank manager... move over here.

02:41.393 --> 02:44.082
Another one is going for the bank manager.

02:45.637 --> 02:47.425
He's getting manager's key.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.740
He's going to the back of bank.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.091
We got squad cars en route.

02:54.092 --> 02:55.516
Castle, I need you to
listen very carefully.

02:55.517 --> 02:56.672
How many are there?

02:56.673 --> 02:59.923
There are three.

03:02.497 --> 03:04.062
Make that four.

03:04.193 --> 03:06.871
So you're the hero I'm
gonna make an example of.

03:09.025 --> 03:10.605
Sorry. Your friend can't talk right now.

03:10.606 --> 03:13.145
I wouldn't worry about him.
I'd worry about yourself.

03:13.146 --> 03:14.924
I've got squad cars on their way.

03:14.925 --> 03:15.654
Are you a cop?

03:15.655 --> 03:16.567
You called a cop?

03:16.568 --> 03:19.775
No. We were already on line
when you guys came in.

03:19.776 --> 03:21.931
Listen to me. So far, nobody has been hurt

03:21.932 --> 03:23.670
and nothing has been stolen.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.598
So if you just leave the
same way that you came in,

03:26.599 --> 03:28.170
you can just disappear.

03:28.225 --> 03:30.355
You gonna promise not to come look for me?

03:30.922 --> 03:33.425
I don't look. I hunt.

03:33.426 --> 03:35.895
And trust me, you don't want that.

03:36.261 --> 03:37.339
So leave now,

03:37.340 --> 03:39.446
and this will just be a
quirky little article

03:39.447 --> 03:41.570
in the Metro section.

03:43.931 --> 03:45.104
Sorry, sweetheart.

03:45.105 --> 03:47.088
I'd rather make the front page.

03:48.776 --> 03:49.981
Let's go.

03:50.124 --> 03:51.546
Dr. Howser, Dr. Quinn,

03:51.547 --> 03:53.191
cops are gonna be here
sooner than we thought.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.872
Now kiss the floor, like the others.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.854
Come on. You, too. Get down.

03:57.018 --> 03:58.528
Dr. Huxtable, let's go.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.779
Bank cameras are down.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.621
Memory drives are destroyed.

04:05.275 --> 04:06.435
Cops!

04:06.436 --> 04:08.901
All right, doctors, we trained for this.

04:08.902 --> 04:10.299
You know what to do.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.263
Looks like we're all gonna get
to know each other a lot better.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:39.394 --> 04:41.485
I want SWAT analysis, sitrep,

04:41.486 --> 04:43.527
building blueprints, five minutes.

04:44.179 --> 04:44.820
Who are you?

04:44.821 --> 04:46.281
Detective Kate Beckett, Homicide.

04:46.282 --> 04:47.576
I'll be sure to call if someone dies.

04:47.577 --> 04:48.814
Meanwhile, I need you to step outside...

04:48.815 --> 04:51.403
No, sir. My partner is in that bank.

04:51.404 --> 04:52.822
Wait. We got a cop in there?

04:53.073 --> 04:54.579
He's a civilian investigator.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.888
He and I were on the phone
when they took over the bank.

04:56.889 --> 04:58.371
He said that there's
four suspects in there.

04:58.372 --> 05:00.312
They're dressed up in doctor scrubs.

05:00.313 --> 05:01.126
Anything else you can tell me?

05:01.127 --> 05:03.128
Yeah, I spoke with one of the suspects.

05:03.129 --> 05:04.776
Then what was his demeanor?

05:05.088 --> 05:07.450
Calm, actually. Very calm.

05:08.240 --> 05:08.909
Thanks for the intel.

05:08.910 --> 05:11.182
We'll do everything we can to
get your partner out safe.

05:11.183 --> 05:12.738
Okay, so what's our next move?

05:12.739 --> 05:15.840
Well, your next move is
to leave my command post.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.608
You want to help your partner,

05:17.609 --> 05:19.148
let me do my job.

05:20.836 --> 05:22.206
I need a line to that bank.

05:22.207 --> 05:23.063
I want to talk to this guy.

05:23.064 --> 05:24.422
Yes, sir.

05:24.679 --> 05:26.609
You miss your cue, detective.

05:36.534 --> 05:37.752
All right.

05:37.753 --> 05:40.302
I'm gonna make this real simple.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.314
You move...

05:43.102 --> 05:44.537
You die.

05:44.807 --> 05:46.102
Got it?

05:51.584 --> 05:52.946
Is anyone hurt?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.044
All right.

05:56.396 --> 05:57.881
Stay relaxed.

05:58.056 --> 05:59.568
Do as they say.

05:59.773 --> 06:01.309
We'll get through this.

06:01.437 --> 06:03.054
The cops will get us out.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.055
What did you find out?

06:10.056 --> 06:12.022
That our services aren't needed.

06:14.811 --> 06:16.913
Espo, do you still have buddies in E.S.U.?

06:16.914 --> 06:17.640
Of course.

06:17.641 --> 06:19.094
Good. I want to know what they know.

06:19.095 --> 06:20.463
And let's get ahold of major crimes,

06:20.464 --> 06:22.933
find out if there are any other
rubberies with similar M.O.s.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.196
The more we know about these guys,

06:24.197 --> 06:25.753
the more leverage we got.

06:25.754 --> 06:27.189
Detective Beckett.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.712
Captain Peterson would like a word.

06:33.986 --> 06:36.295
Tell me, what were you thinking?

06:36.296 --> 06:38.195
I was just trying to help out, sir.

06:38.494 --> 06:40.353
What, by charming the bank robber?

06:40.354 --> 06:42.045
- What?
- We get him on the horn,

06:42.046 --> 06:43.280
but before I can get two words out,

06:43.281 --> 06:45.442
he says, and I quote, "I will only talk

06:45.443 --> 06:48.541
to the lady cop the one
with the bedroom voice."

06:48.542 --> 06:50.427
Yeah. You wanted in?

06:50.519 --> 06:51.291
Well, you're in.

06:51.292 --> 06:51.892
No, sir.

06:51.893 --> 06:55.077
I don't have any training
in hostage negotiations.

06:55.078 --> 06:56.993
Well, I don't have time
to give you a seminar,

06:56.994 --> 06:57.960
so think of it like this--

06:57.961 --> 06:59.584
You do the opposite of what ever

06:59.585 --> 07:01.061
homicide training tells you, okay?

07:01.062 --> 07:02.366
So don't yell, don't bully,

07:02.367 --> 07:03.596
don't--don't threaten him in any way.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.581
It's all about keeping them calm.

07:06.252 --> 07:07.797
Detective...

07:07.798 --> 07:09.003
You up for this?

07:09.374 --> 07:11.325
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

07:11.326 --> 07:12.991
Now it's important to keep him talking.

07:12.992 --> 07:14.113
You gotta build a rapport.

07:14.114 --> 07:17.464
As long as he's busy talking,
he's not busy hurting hostages.

07:17.465 --> 07:18.318
- Okay.
- Okay?

07:22.444 --> 07:23.232
Who's this?

07:23.233 --> 07:24.589
This is detective Kate Beckett.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.191
I understand that you
wanted to speak with me.

07:26.192 --> 07:27.421
Yeah, I don't like that other guy.

07:27.422 --> 07:29.184
Yeah, me neither.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.725
You said to build a rapport.

07:34.667 --> 07:35.695
So what's your name?

07:35.696 --> 07:37.616
You can call me Trapper John.

07:38.005 --> 07:40.405
A "MASH" fan? It's nice.

07:40.406 --> 07:41.713
So how you doin'?

07:41.714 --> 07:43.160
Anything I can do to help?

07:43.161 --> 07:45.368
Oh, Kate, Kate, Kate,

07:45.546 --> 07:47.949
you're running that idiot's
playbook, aren't you?

07:48.417 --> 07:50.841
What did captain confidence tell you,

07:50.842 --> 07:52.251
keep me calm,

07:53.010 --> 07:54.033
build a rapport,

07:54.557 --> 07:55.565
extract information.

07:56.702 --> 07:58.008
Here's how it's gonna work--

07:58.009 --> 08:00.996
You lie to me, I kill hostages.

08:00.997 --> 08:04.236
You jerk me around, I kill hostages.

08:04.422 --> 08:08.489
If you storm the bank, I kill hostages.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.017
And, Kate...

08:13.048 --> 08:15.383
I'll start with your boyfriend.

08:36.023 --> 08:37.160
Well, we learned one thing.

08:37.162 --> 08:38.067
What's that?

08:38.068 --> 08:39.111
He's not a punk who just woke up

08:39.111 --> 08:40.597
and decided to rob a bank.

08:40.599 --> 08:43.282
He knows what he's doing.
He knows our playbook.

08:43.283 --> 08:44.644
This guy's a pro.

08:44.761 --> 08:46.919
S.W.A.T tap into the, uh,
camera the bank yet?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.271
Stil working on it, sir.

08:48.272 --> 08:51.351
Also there's a Susan Craig from
the bank's main branch on line 4.

08:51.352 --> 08:52.566
Sir, what do you want me to do?

08:52.656 --> 08:54.625
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry?

08:55.072 --> 08:56.144
It's not a homicide, detective.

08:56.145 --> 08:57.548
Not about moving forward

08:57.616 --> 08:58.611
or digging for the next clue.

08:58.612 --> 09:01.412
Here sometimes, no move is the best move.

09:01.413 --> 09:03.304
Let Trapper John think about things

09:03.305 --> 09:05.195
and we'll call him back.

09:28.588 --> 09:30.375
This is your fault, you know?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.862
He called the cops.

09:35.312 --> 09:36.699
I saw him.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.198
If it wasn't for this guy,

09:38.199 --> 09:40.050
the bank robbers would've come and gone,

09:40.051 --> 09:40.889
we'd all be outta here.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.651
No. No, the cops were coming anyway.

09:43.652 --> 09:45.381
The bank robbers, they screwed up.

09:45.382 --> 09:47.421
They pulled the bottom bills
from the cash drawer.

09:47.422 --> 09:50.781
Which automatically triggers
the silence alarm, ok?

09:50.782 --> 09:52.624
No one's fault.

09:57.662 --> 09:59.089
Simone,

09:59.113 --> 10:00.825
how far along are you?

10:01.063 --> 10:02.163
32 weeks.

10:02.865 --> 10:04.400
Holding a pregnant woman hostage?

10:04.401 --> 10:05.677
They should let you go.

10:05.678 --> 10:07.393
Lady, they're not letting her go.

10:07.394 --> 10:09.389
They're not letting any of us go.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.374
I've seen this movie before.
I know how it ends.

10:12.375 --> 10:13.335
All of us dead.

10:13.336 --> 10:15.731
We are not gonna die.

10:15.897 --> 10:17.569
We gonna be fine.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.672
I work with the police, and my
partner's gonna get us out.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.788
Dr. Huxtable.

10:30.911 --> 10:32.240
Mr. Davenport,

10:32.241 --> 10:33.795
what's behind those doors back there?

10:33.796 --> 10:35.975
Restroom, break rooms, security room,

10:35.976 --> 10:38.021
and the safety deposit boxes.

10:38.022 --> 10:40.373
I saw them take a key
from around your neck.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.220
What does it open?

10:41.221 --> 10:44.583
Yeah, that's my security key
for the safety deposit boxes.

10:45.497 --> 10:47.905
Something is going on here.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.761
Why does he keep going back there

10:49.762 --> 10:52.472
when there's a vault full
of cash up there untouched.

10:52.473 --> 10:54.468
Richard, I know that look.

10:54.469 --> 10:56.698
Please, curiosity kill the cat.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.237
Something weird is going on here.

10:58.238 --> 11:00.249
We need to figure it out what it is.

11:01.255 --> 11:04.126
And I know exactly what to do.

11:04.406 --> 11:05.829
Don't worry, mother.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.892
I saw this work on "Die Hard".

11:07.893 --> 11:09.226
Oh, great.

11:11.163 --> 11:12.033
Uh, Mr. Howser.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.560
Excuse me, Dr. Howser.

11:13.561 --> 11:14.551
You got a death wish?

11:14.552 --> 11:16.257
No, just a small bladder.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.472
And, uh, unfortunately,

11:17.473 --> 11:19.744
it looike we're gonna be here for a while.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.505
So unless you like it messy,

11:21.506 --> 11:23.759
now might be a good time

11:23.760 --> 11:25.841
to start arranging some restroom runs.

11:28.953 --> 11:30.060
Thank you.

11:44.685 --> 11:46.605
So... why Doogie Howser?

11:46.855 --> 11:50.188
I mean, there's so many cool
TV doctors you could pick--

11:50.286 --> 11:52.202
Dr. House, Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Phil.

11:52.203 --> 11:53.485
Shut up.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.659
Anything?

11:57.660 --> 11:58.878
All bad news.

11:58.879 --> 12:01.399
E.S.U. can't get eyes or ears inside.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.787
Bank cameras are disable,

12:02.788 --> 12:04.637
the walls are too thick
to drill from outside.

12:04.638 --> 12:06.362
So what if E.S.U. storms the bank?

12:06.363 --> 12:08.063
That'll be going in blind.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.991
And in your experience, in this scenario

12:11.992 --> 12:14.502
what are the hostages' chance of survival?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.622
Hey, um, I'm sorry about before--

12:31.623 --> 12:32.430
Oh, please.

12:32.431 --> 12:33.819
- It's--
- It's the job.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.639
- Yeah.
- Actually, I'm a fan.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.148
"A Midsummer Night's Dream,"

12:37.149 --> 12:38.552
- you played Titania...
- Oh, my goodness.

12:38.553 --> 12:39.700
In Shakespeare in the Park.

12:39.701 --> 12:41.275
That was in the '80s.

12:41.276 --> 12:43.519
How could you possibly remember that?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.583
Oh, you're unforgettable.

12:46.385 --> 12:47.642
If I have to die,

12:47.643 --> 12:50.157
I'm glad I'm going with
someone who knows my work.

12:50.158 --> 12:51.394
Thank you.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.038
All right. Who else needs the loo?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.222
I'll go.

13:05.332 --> 13:06.801
Did you learn anything?

13:06.883 --> 13:07.678
Two things.

13:07.679 --> 13:11.394
Firstly, the restrooms here
at the bank are quite lovely,

13:11.395 --> 13:12.616
excepting for the lack of windows

13:12.617 --> 13:14.015
or any other means of escape.

13:14.652 --> 13:16.458
Second, and more importantly,

13:16.482 --> 13:17.647
I was right.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.082
Something odd is going on.

13:20.083 --> 13:23.150
I saw Trapper John in the
safe deposit box room,

13:23.151 --> 13:23.934
he pulled out a box

13:23.935 --> 13:26.820
and he was removing letters and photos.

13:26.821 --> 13:29.428
And he didn't break in, either.
He used both keys.

13:29.429 --> 13:30.446
Well, one's my manager's key.

13:30.447 --> 13:32.828
The other one must be owner's key.

13:32.829 --> 13:34.959
Is this a very strange
time for Trapper John

13:34.960 --> 13:36.874
to get something from his safe deposit box.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.112
Well, I'm assuming the box isn't his.

13:39.215 --> 13:41.648
These guys set off the alarm on purpose.

13:41.649 --> 13:44.683
They wanted this hostage stand up.

13:44.786 --> 13:45.853
I mean, come on. Look at these guys.

13:45.854 --> 13:47.042
They're professionals, right?

13:47.043 --> 13:48.002
They know better than to take

13:48.003 --> 13:49.534
the bottom bills from the cash draw.

13:49.535 --> 13:50.736
But why?

13:53.555 --> 13:54.751
Time.

13:54.753 --> 13:57.356
Safe deposit box keys don't
have numbers on them.

13:57.357 --> 13:58.925
So if it's not his key,

13:58.926 --> 14:01.579
he'd have to try every lock
until he got to the right box,

14:01.580 --> 14:02.729
and that would take time.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.365
Okay, Mr. Davenport,

14:04.953 --> 14:06.303
the--the box he pulled

14:06.304 --> 14:07.324
was on the north wall.

14:07.325 --> 14:10.559
It was four columns over, three boxes down.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.162
That would be box...

14:13.163 --> 14:14.520
120.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.148
Okay.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.580
We figure out whose box that is,

14:17.581 --> 14:19.696
we can figure out what these
people are really up to.

14:19.697 --> 14:20.553
Yeah, well, I don't think

14:20.554 --> 14:22.874
they're gonna let us use the computer.

14:24.282 --> 14:26.265
Maybe we won't have to.

14:26.555 --> 14:28.363
Mother, the bracelet I gave
you for your birthday.

14:28.364 --> 14:30.737
Oh, no. I love this bracelet.

14:32.411 --> 14:33.867
All right.

14:37.447 --> 14:38.455
Captain, it's him.

14:38.456 --> 14:39.215
Remember the strategy.

14:39.216 --> 14:40.428
Yeah.

14:44.663 --> 14:46.297
Hey. How's it going?

14:46.329 --> 14:47.863
So far, so good.

14:48.319 --> 14:50.430
Yeah, and how are the hostages?

14:50.431 --> 14:53.421
Pretty concerned about the
pregnant bank teller Simone.

14:53.422 --> 14:54.630
It's kind of a stressful situation.

14:54.631 --> 14:55.950
You might wanna get her out of there.

14:55.951 --> 14:57.471
No, no, no, Kate.

14:57.486 --> 15:00.631
You gotta give before you can receive.

15:01.772 --> 15:03.567
Okay. What would you like?

15:04.214 --> 15:05.190
A bus...

15:05.191 --> 15:06.413
With tinted windows,

15:06.414 --> 15:07.721
that'll take me, my partners,

15:07.722 --> 15:09.733
and my hostages to teter boro airport.

15:09.734 --> 15:10.870
There, you're gonna have a plane waiting

15:10.871 --> 15:14.292
to take to the foreign country
of my choosing, now you do that,

15:14.387 --> 15:16.298
I give you the knocked up bank teller.

15:16.299 --> 15:17.730
Once we land in paradise,

15:17.731 --> 15:18.922
I'll release the rest hostages.

15:18.923 --> 15:19.485
And, Kate...

15:21.348 --> 15:23.038
You got three hours.

15:24.093 --> 15:25.459
All right, Monfriez, find me a bus

15:25.460 --> 15:26.771
with tinted windows and get it over here.

15:26.772 --> 15:28.947
Wait a minute. You're actually
giving him what he wants?

15:28.948 --> 15:30.716
Of course not. The only way that
guy is leaving the building

15:30.717 --> 15:32.910
is either in handcuffs or a body bag.

15:33.061 --> 15:33.883
But if it comes to it,

15:33.884 --> 15:36.384
I can use that bus to lure the robbers out

15:36.385 --> 15:38.058
and have snipers take 'em out.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.368
What the...

15:43.910 --> 15:44.957
You see that?

15:44.958 --> 15:45.960
Yeah.

15:53.775 --> 15:55.208
That's Morse code.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.376
Stop, Richard.

16:04.926 --> 16:05.961
Clear.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.758
Uh, S-D-B-1-2-0,

16:11.759 --> 16:13.845
over and over again.
What do you think it means?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.613
Someone's initials or a code.

16:15.614 --> 16:19.871
- Same day bank.
- Save decimal--

16:19.872 --> 16:21.037
Wait. Wait, sa--

16:21.038 --> 16:23.429
Um, could be, uh... safe.
Safe?

16:23.430 --> 16:26.428
S-D-B. Safe deposit box.

16:26.429 --> 16:29.034
Safe deposit box 120. That's it.

16:29.035 --> 16:30.033
Really? What would a safe deposit box

16:30.034 --> 16:31.129
have to do with anything?

16:31.130 --> 16:32.577
I don't know, but if
Castle when to the trouble

16:32.578 --> 16:34.458
of sending that message,
it means something.

16:34.459 --> 16:35.738
How do you know it's him?

16:35.739 --> 16:37.878
Trust me, it's him.

16:38.004 --> 16:40.783
Safe deposit box number 120
belongs to a married couple,

16:40.784 --> 16:42.242
Agnes & Gideon Fields.

16:42.243 --> 16:43.537
Anything special about the box?

16:43.538 --> 16:46.725
No, just that bank record show
they both access it monthly.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.892
I'll get my team to check it out.

16:49.146 --> 16:50.164
Richard...

16:50.842 --> 16:53.660
Be innocent, be innocent.

16:54.465 --> 16:55.979
You're indicating.

17:00.338 --> 17:03.797
See? Even a layman can spot
an uninspired performance.

17:04.330 --> 17:05.684
Yes, mother.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.301
When I was coming back,

17:19.303 --> 17:22.319
I-I got a glimpse inside
their--their duffle bag.

17:22.470 --> 17:23.813
There were white bricks

17:23.814 --> 17:26.518
with wires and timers attached to it.

17:26.519 --> 17:28.646
I-I think it could be C-4.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.398
C-4? Are you sure?

17:30.399 --> 17:32.211
Yeah. They're gonna blow us all up.

17:32.212 --> 17:34.740
- Calm down. Just calm...
- How could I supposed to calm down?

17:35.935 --> 17:37.067
We all have families.

17:37.068 --> 17:38.678
Now, calm down.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.287
What's your name?

17:42.404 --> 17:45.585
- Sal. Sal Martino.
- Okay.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.990
You got a wife, Sal, kids?

17:47.991 --> 17:50.256
Yeah. I have a son.

17:50.542 --> 17:51.696
What's his name?

17:52.767 --> 17:53.800
Connor.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.213
I bet the only thing you can think about

17:56.214 --> 17:58.072
is seeing him again. Am I right?

17:58.599 --> 18:00.037
You have no idea.

18:00.038 --> 18:00.992
Good.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.473
So you just keep thinking on that.

18:03.998 --> 18:06.760
You think about how you gonna
see Connor again real soon.

18:07.023 --> 18:09.401
Because I'm gonna figur out ways
to get all of us out of here.

18:09.402 --> 18:10.717
I promise.

18:13.556 --> 18:14.646
I need some air.

18:14.981 --> 18:17.011
Damn. Why is there no air in this place?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.298
What the hell is going on here?

18:19.672 --> 18:21.135
I thought this was about
a safe deposit box.

18:21.136 --> 18:22.631
Why would they need C-4?

18:22.632 --> 18:25.781
Maybe they don't want anyone to
know what they stole from that box

18:25.782 --> 18:29.385
and the C-4 is to make sure
that no one ever does.

18:32.902 --> 18:34.877
Agnes and Gideon Fields, open up, please.

18:34.878 --> 18:35.973
This is NYPD.

18:35.974 --> 18:36.655
This doesn't make any sense.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.427
What could the old couple's
safety deposit box

18:38.428 --> 18:40.750
have to do what's going on in that bank?

18:41.084 --> 18:42.334
Maybe everything.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.880
The bank said that Agnes and Gideon

18:43.881 --> 18:46.182
were accessing their box
once a month, right?

18:46.183 --> 18:47.969
I just got a text from the precinct.

18:48.022 --> 18:49.446
Gideon Fields died four years ago.

18:49.447 --> 18:51.890
So whoever's accessing that box wasn't him.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.279
Agnes, this is the NYPD.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.530
Open up, please.

18:57.376 --> 18:58.136
The radio's on.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't go there.

18:59.712 --> 19:01.556
We--we don't have a warrant.
We don't have probable cause.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.606
Bro, Castle's life depends on this.

19:04.620 --> 19:05.734
Did you just hear that?

19:05.972 --> 19:08.275
I think I just heard someone
yell out "Help, police!"

19:08.276 --> 19:10.569
"Help, police!"
There it is again.

19:11.631 --> 19:13.416
NYPD! Agnes!

19:23.486 --> 19:24.569
Yeah.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.449
It's Agnes.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.040
What the hell is going on?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.793
Looks like the owner of
our safety deposit box

19:35.794 --> 19:37.684
has been dead maybe a week.

19:38.107 --> 19:40.473
Ligature marks on her neck
indicate strangulation.

19:40.474 --> 19:42.082
What'd you find at the crime scene?

19:42.083 --> 19:43.415
The place is trashed.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.951
The killer was looking for something.

19:44.952 --> 19:47.739
There's a broken key chain
necklace on the body,

19:47.832 --> 19:48.841
but there's no key.

19:48.842 --> 19:51.591
Ok, that might be where she kept
the key for the safe deposit box.

19:51.592 --> 19:52.511
I don't get it

19:52.512 --> 19:54.603
this is a little old retired librarian.

19:54.604 --> 19:56.539
What could possibly be
in her safe deposit box

19:56.540 --> 19:58.067
that would be worth doing all this.

19:58.068 --> 20:00.243
Nazi gold, cold fusion,

20:00.244 --> 20:01.659
map to Atlantis.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.835
Hey, Castle Jr.,

20:02.836 --> 20:04.932
could you maybe start
thinking like a cop, please?

20:04.933 --> 20:05.996
I am.

20:05.997 --> 20:06.691
Are you?

20:06.692 --> 20:08.051
It had to have been something huge,

20:08.052 --> 20:10.126
that was worth killing her over, right?

20:10.525 --> 20:12.855
Hey, super cop,

20:12.957 --> 20:14.055
check it out.

20:15.060 --> 20:17.107
- What is it?
- It's a bug.

20:17.108 --> 20:18.270
It's not from a spy shop, either.

20:18.271 --> 20:19.741
This looks professional.

20:19.742 --> 20:20.869
Listen, I need you to dig up

20:20.870 --> 20:23.352
everything you can on Agnes Fields.
I gotta go.

20:26.119 --> 20:27.077
They're here, aren't they?

20:27.078 --> 20:28.042
My dad and my gramma...

20:28.043 --> 20:29.162
- I know they were coming to this bank...
- Alexis

20:29.163 --> 20:30.137
and no one's answering their phones,

20:30.138 --> 20:30.889
and my dad always takes my phone.

20:30.890 --> 20:34.838
- And you're here.
- Listen, everything is gonna be fine, ok?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.670
But they are inside that bank.

20:40.127 --> 20:41.200
What is it?

20:42.294 --> 20:43.837
I need to get over to those windows

20:43.838 --> 20:46.109
to get a message to Beckett about the C-4.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.741
Oh, come on, Richard.

20:47.742 --> 20:49.477
Please. It is too dangerous.

20:49.478 --> 20:51.942
We are hostages. Behave accordingly.

20:51.943 --> 20:52.960
Please.

20:58.494 --> 20:59.961
Don't, Richard...

21:00.590 --> 21:02.552
Uh, Dr. Quinn.

21:03.326 --> 21:04.409
What's your problem?

21:04.410 --> 21:06.930
Uh, it's just, where I come from, 
Dr. Quinn,

21:06.931 --> 21:09.837
we don't make pregnant
women sit on hard floors.

21:09.979 --> 21:12.901
Is it all right if I get some
cushions from the sofa for her?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.636
Make it fast, pretty boy.

21:17.370 --> 21:18.380
Thanks.

21:25.155 --> 21:26.114
Stop!

21:26.115 --> 21:27.508
Oh! Right there!

21:27.509 --> 21:29.614
Stop or I'm going to shoot.

21:29.666 --> 21:31.482
Air. Air.

21:31.483 --> 21:32.479
- Hey! I said stop!
- I need air.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.680
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I need...

21:33.681 --> 21:35.503
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Air.

21:35.504 --> 21:36.664
Sal, stop.

21:37.977 --> 21:39.001
On the floor.

21:39.002 --> 21:40.129
Don't! Don't shoot!

21:42.626 --> 21:44.788
Easy! Easy! Don't shoot!

21:45.442 --> 21:47.117
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

21:47.562 --> 21:48.954
He's having a seizure.

21:48.955 --> 21:51.984
Sal, easy, easy.

21:53.766 --> 21:55.761
Great, epilepsy.

21:55.926 --> 21:57.014
This guy needs help.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.121
Then help him.

21:58.703 --> 21:59.710
Hey, look, Dr. Quinn,

21:59.711 --> 22:01.611
the man just had a grand mal seizure.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.035
So unless you realy are a medicine woman

22:03.036 --> 22:04.646
he needs a hospital now.

22:06.981 --> 22:09.207
Get Trapper John. Move!

22:10.490 --> 22:11.249
Perfect.

22:11.250 --> 22:14.909
The fake doctor calls in another
fake doctor for a consult.

22:16.243 --> 22:17.257
What am I supposed to do?

22:17.258 --> 22:19.220
Nothing. We're doing everything we can.

22:19.698 --> 22:21.284
You don't understand. They're all I've got.

22:21.327 --> 22:22.414
Do you here me? They're all I've got.

22:22.511 --> 22:24.644
Alexis, listen to me, I promise you,

22:24.912 --> 22:26.563
they are gonna be okay.

22:27.664 --> 22:28.658
They better.

22:29.915 --> 22:30.893
Beckett.

22:31.258 --> 22:32.437
Incoming call.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.656
Ok, I'm gonna go. Stay with her.

22:44.286 --> 22:46.144
Hey, it's Ash. I'll hit you back.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.990
Ash, I know you're busy, but I need you.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.384
My dad, he's...

22:52.902 --> 22:54.222
You've got to call me back right away,

22:54.223 --> 22:55.624
as soon as you get this.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.107
I really need you.

22:57.449 --> 22:58.267
Beckett.

22:58.268 --> 23:01.548
Look, Kate, one of the hostages just
had a epileptic fit and passed out,

23:01.549 --> 23:02.563
and normally, I wouldn't care,

23:02.564 --> 23:03.870
but it's starting to upset
the other hostages,

23:03.871 --> 23:05.364
and I don't want anyone
trying to be a hero.

23:05.365 --> 23:07.091
So, here's the deal.

23:07.092 --> 23:09.275
You're gonna send in one
paramedic to getting in

23:09.276 --> 23:11.107
in exchange for this generosity.

23:11.108 --> 23:13.247
You're gonna have my bus
right outside in 20.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.348
That's not enough time.

23:15.349 --> 23:16.475
But it is for me.

23:16.476 --> 23:17.604
Take this guy now,

23:17.605 --> 23:19.292
and get my bus outside in 20.

23:19.293 --> 23:21.239
Or I'll start popping hostages.

23:23.956 --> 23:25.582
How soon till we get that bus?

23:25.677 --> 23:26.852
35 minutes.

23:26.853 --> 23:27.979
You're gonna have to ask for more time.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.478
He's not gonna go for it.

23:29.581 --> 23:30.643
Then we're gonna storm the bank.

23:30.644 --> 23:32.421
We can't storm the bank.

23:32.422 --> 23:34.421
We don't know where anybody is in there.

23:34.422 --> 23:36.781
If we go in there, hostages
are just gonna get killed.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.266
Listen, if we're gonna save any of them,

23:38.267 --> 23:39.611
we have no other choice.

23:39.612 --> 23:40.774
Maybe we do.

23:41.324 --> 23:44.423
We could use this sick
hostage to our advantage.

23:44.876 --> 23:46.385
Instead of sending in a paramedic,

23:46.386 --> 23:48.282
we send in a cop with tactical training.

23:48.283 --> 23:49.650
The cop gets intel

23:49.651 --> 23:52.100
for when S.W.A.T.
goes in to breach the bank.

23:52.338 --> 23:54.076
I'm guessing you have a cop in mind.

24:07.378 --> 24:08.412
Search her.

24:18.994 --> 24:20.020
She's clear.

24:20.277 --> 24:21.065
Make it quick.

24:29.627 --> 24:30.661
How's he doing?

24:31.018 --> 24:31.972
Not good.

24:33.186 --> 24:34.673
His name's Sal Martino.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.938
He has epilepsy.

24:35.939 --> 24:37.988
I think the seizure was prone by stress.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.246
Hey, Sal. Hey, buddy.

24:41.676 --> 24:42.694
How you doing?

24:42.922 --> 24:44.530
Sal, listen to me, I want you to know

24:44.531 --> 24:46.306
that there are people out
there care about you,

24:46.307 --> 24:47.676
so just keep breathing.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.906
I promise you

24:50.441 --> 24:51.835
I'll get you outta here.

24:57.102 --> 24:59.277
Don't talk about it. Be about it.

24:59.278 --> 25:00.432
And you...

25:00.574 --> 25:03.174
Help get him on that gurney. Now!

25:03.175 --> 25:04.081
Sal, you ready?

25:04.082 --> 25:04.987
We're gonna get you up
on the count of three.

25:04.988 --> 25:06.569
One, two, three.

25:06.894 --> 25:07.872
Okay, buddy.

25:08.390 --> 25:10.182
Easy buddy. Okay.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.124
You're all right.

25:20.003 --> 25:21.084
Okay.

25:47.239 --> 25:50.389
Your dad's okay. They're both... okay.

25:50.787 --> 25:51.677
What's wrong?

25:51.678 --> 25:53.805
Alexis, I need you to go
behind that yellow line now.

25:53.806 --> 25:55.298
- You got it.
- Take her behind line.

25:56.168 --> 25:57.523
- Hey.
- Hey, Ashley, my father...

25:57.524 --> 25:58.659
- Wait, what?
- Can you hear me?

25:58.660 --> 25:59.531
I'll call you later.

25:59.532 --> 26:00.794
No, you can't call me later.

26:00.795 --> 26:01.632
Of course I can.

26:01.633 --> 26:04.722
Ashley, I can't hear.
What? Ashley I can't...

26:05.408 --> 26:07.550
- There's C-4 in the bank?
- I didn't see any,

26:07.551 --> 26:09.832
but if Castle says it's
in there it's in there.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.288
Well, that means the breach
is out of the question.

26:11.289 --> 26:13.571
I'm not gonna send my
boys into a bomb fight.

26:13.633 --> 26:15.620
We're gonna have to take
these guys out on the bus.

26:15.978 --> 26:17.643
That bus is still 20 minutes out.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.883
His deadline is in five.

26:18.884 --> 26:20.673
He's gonna starting killing hostages.

26:20.674 --> 26:22.475
Well, we have to buy more time.

26:26.370 --> 26:27.401
Where's my bus?

26:27.402 --> 26:30.081
The bus is on its way.
It'll be there in 20 minutes.

26:30.082 --> 26:31.817
The hostages will be dead in two.

26:31.818 --> 26:32.322
No.

26:32.323 --> 26:34.424
Nobody needs to die.

26:34.425 --> 26:35.944
Okay? It's coming. It's just--

26:35.945 --> 26:38.533
- It's stuck in traffic.
- We have rules, Kate.

26:38.534 --> 26:39.695
I said I won't kill anyone,

26:39.696 --> 26:40.731
you said you gave me a bus.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.134
I live up to mine at the end of the deal.

26:42.135 --> 26:43.781
And I'm gonna live up to mine, I just...

26:43.782 --> 26:45.760
I warned you not to jerk me around.

26:46.054 --> 26:47.477
Now I was clear about the consequences.

26:47.478 --> 26:49.407
Do I need to approve how serious I am?
Is that it?

26:49.408 --> 26:51.903
Okay, I think we both just
need to take a breath

26:51.904 --> 26:52.943
and we can talk about--

26:52.944 --> 26:54.153
I'm done talking!

26:55.592 --> 26:56.886
What was that?

26:57.436 --> 26:58.859
A warning shot, Kate.

26:58.860 --> 27:00.454
The next one's for the kill.

27:00.663 --> 27:02.439
- Don't you touch him, you son of a bitch!
- Davenport, hold her back!

27:02.440 --> 27:04.530
- Keep your hands off!
- I got this.

27:04.896 --> 27:07.133
I'm gonna make a pretty red
stains at your boyfriend, Kate.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.167
I got my gun to his throat

27:08.168 --> 27:10.242
and I'm gonna paint a Jackson
Pollock with his insides.

27:10.357 --> 27:11.229
You need to calm him down--

27:11.230 --> 27:12.608
Listen to me, jackass.

27:12.609 --> 27:13.938
I do not control traffic,

27:13.939 --> 27:15.639
so you're gonna have to give me 20 minutes.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.759
- Now you got one minute, Kate.
- No.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.659
I've got 20.

27:20.313 --> 27:21.635
Do you hear me?

27:22.154 --> 27:23.291
20.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.438
Because if you pull that trigger,

27:25.439 --> 27:28.303
I will walk through those
doors and personally

27:28.304 --> 27:30.466
put a bullet through your skull.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.410
Okay, Kate.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.193
You got 20 more minutes.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.410
Well, that's one way to negotiate.

27:49.536 --> 27:51.378
Your girlfriend is a hellcat.

27:51.857 --> 27:53.625
Yeah, well, she's not my girlfriend.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.665
She too much woman for you?

27:58.072 --> 27:59.999
So why are you guys robbing this bank?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.138
Sutton's law.

28:01.664 --> 28:04.423
When asked why he robbed banks,
Willie Sutton famously replied,

28:04.424 --> 28:06.057
"Because that's where the money is."

28:10.848 --> 28:12.814
Except Willie Sutton never said that.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.135
It was a reporter who made up that quote.

28:15.136 --> 28:17.385
You see, writers-- we're really good.

28:17.386 --> 28:19.879
Alternate reality to the fake narrative.

28:20.213 --> 28:22.792
And the story I see you guys spinning here

28:23.414 --> 28:25.368
is really not about stealing money.

28:25.886 --> 28:26.943
Is that so?

28:26.944 --> 28:28.810
You and your crew don't wear gloves.

28:28.926 --> 28:31.476
Obviously you're not worried
about fingerprints,

28:31.477 --> 28:33.048
which means you're not in the system.

28:33.062 --> 28:34.593
And those accents?

28:35.263 --> 28:36.466
You're mercs,

28:36.784 --> 28:38.679
which means you're just
want to get on that bus.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.295
So... what was in that box?

28:41.296 --> 28:42.559
Why the C-4?

28:42.560 --> 28:45.738
And what are you really gonna do with us?

28:48.263 --> 28:49.554
Oh, I like you.

28:50.477 --> 28:52.282
That's why I'm gonna kill you last.

28:54.486 --> 28:55.585
Trapper John.

28:58.006 --> 28:59.320
We're good to go.

29:00.598 --> 29:01.557
All right.

29:01.558 --> 29:02.693
Everybody, on your feet.

29:02.694 --> 29:04.400
Let's go. Up, up, up, up.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.568
What are you gonna do?

29:07.309 --> 29:10.520
You're clever.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

29:15.439 --> 29:17.845
We still got 18 minutes.
I want everybody in position.

29:17.846 --> 29:20.094
S.W.A.T. can rendezvous
with the bus here on 49th.

29:20.095 --> 29:21.101
They can load there.

29:21.102 --> 29:23.392
I want snipers here, here, and here.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.525
Get Roman on the horn.

29:24.526 --> 29:26.400
Why he didn't ask for something?

29:26.535 --> 29:27.521
What?

29:28.638 --> 29:29.819
Sir...

29:29.946 --> 29:31.465
He gave me 20 minutes,

29:31.466 --> 29:34.228
and he didn't ask for anything in return.

29:34.295 --> 29:35.830
If he wanted to maintain control,

29:35.831 --> 29:37.485
he would've asked for something.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.845
I mean, this is all way to easy.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.029
Take the win, detective.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.597
No, sir. Something is going on.

29:42.598 --> 29:44.825
We are just not asking
right questions. I mean,

29:44.886 --> 29:47.333
why would he bring C-4 to a bank robbery?

29:47.334 --> 29:50.426
What does Agnes Fields' murder
have to do with any of this?

29:50.800 --> 29:52.659
Captain, I get sergent Roman.

29:54.610 --> 29:56.155
Yeah, Roman.

30:02.523 --> 30:05.310
Mother, I find I'm no longer satisfied

30:05.311 --> 30:07.101
with the customer service
at this establishment.

30:07.102 --> 30:09.071
I think we should take
our business elsewhere.

30:10.271 --> 30:12.118
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

30:12.119 --> 30:13.379
Forgive me for dragging you into this. I--

30:13.380 --> 30:15.393
It's okay. It's okay.

30:15.882 --> 30:16.978
Okay.

30:17.162 --> 30:18.369
I love you, mother.

30:19.176 --> 30:20.897
Right back at you, kiddo.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.258
Did you find anything on Agnes?

30:24.259 --> 30:25.942
We've gone over phone and financials

30:25.943 --> 30:26.968
and talked to friends and neighbours.

30:26.969 --> 30:28.169
Nothing sticks out.

30:28.170 --> 30:30.615
What about Agnes's safety deposit box?

30:30.616 --> 30:33.013
Somebody was pretending
to be her dead husband

30:33.014 --> 30:34.482
and accesses since monthly.

30:34.483 --> 30:35.140
Any leads?

30:35.141 --> 30:36.157
Nothing so far.

30:36.158 --> 30:37.042
Relatives?

30:37.043 --> 30:40.478
Uh, Agnes really didn't
have any relatives left.

30:40.479 --> 30:43.029
Her husband's dead, her
daughter and grandson

30:43.030 --> 30:44.829
died in a boating accident over a year ago.

30:44.830 --> 30:46.648
Her only surviving relative
is a former son-in-law--

30:46.649 --> 30:47.459
Ron Brandt.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.038
We left him a message, we
never heard him, Beckett.

30:49.039 --> 30:51.976
Look, we don't have time to
wait for a return phone calls,

30:51.977 --> 30:53.661
so find him.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.114
Castle!

31:21.472 --> 31:22.666
Castle!

31:23.700 --> 31:24.825
Castle!

31:24.932 --> 31:26.012
Beckett.

31:33.549 --> 31:34.617
They're here!

31:35.643 --> 31:36.608
I told you.

31:36.609 --> 31:38.470
Oh, my God.

31:44.378 --> 31:45.801
Here we go, ready?

31:45.942 --> 31:46.921
Ok.

31:48.853 --> 31:49.920
How are you?

31:53.368 --> 31:55.442
He's not the only one here, you know?

31:57.088 --> 31:58.434
Oh, I'm so...

32:00.678 --> 32:02.251
I'm so sorry, Martha.

32:02.494 --> 32:04.712
Excuse me. How you doing?

32:04.713 --> 32:05.943
My ears are...

32:07.498 --> 32:08.480
Everybody account for?

32:08.481 --> 32:10.351
We're all here. We're all okay.

32:10.352 --> 32:11.660
So what happended to the robbers?

32:11.661 --> 32:12.498
They are dead.

32:12.499 --> 32:13.608
They blew themselves up.

32:13.609 --> 32:14.364
What?

32:14.365 --> 32:17.429
Apparently, the C-4 was
part of the exit strategy.

32:17.475 --> 32:19.671
They blasted a hole straight
through the bottom of wall.

32:19.672 --> 32:22.815
And opened a ceiling on the
abandoned subway station below.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.022
Smart plan if they didn't screw it up.

32:25.221 --> 32:27.488
They must have triggered the
explosion before they took cover,

32:27.489 --> 32:29.067
and then they killed themselves.

32:29.749 --> 32:30.830
That's not possible.

32:30.831 --> 32:32.672
C-4, it's a very stable exclusive.

32:32.673 --> 32:33.680
It wouldn't go off accidentally.

32:33.681 --> 32:35.685
These guys were not dime-store bandits.

32:35.686 --> 32:37.798
They were trained, they
were military precision.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.156
They won't set off a explosion prematurely.

32:40.339 --> 32:41.011
Really?

32:41.012 --> 32:43.619
I got an assortment of body
parts that tells me they did.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.552
Let's get outta here.

33:35.525 --> 33:36.210
Is everybody okay?

33:36.300 --> 33:37.261
Yeah, they're fine.

33:37.262 --> 33:38.636
They just need a minute.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.274
We heard all the suspects are dead.

33:40.654 --> 33:42.031
Guys, none of this makes any sense.

33:42.032 --> 33:44.038
An old lady is killed for
her safe deposit box key,

33:44.039 --> 33:46.544
which her dead husband
accesses every month?

33:46.545 --> 33:47.699
And then this?

33:48.423 --> 33:50.099
There's something that we're missing.

33:50.714 --> 33:53.754
What were you saying about Agnes
Fields's last surviving relative?

33:53.755 --> 33:55.957
Her former son-in-law-- Ron Brandt.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.998
We left a message, but he does
a lot of bussiness overseas,

33:57.999 --> 33:59.747
so he may not even be in the country.

34:00.078 --> 34:02.061
He's listed at a penthouse
on the Upper East Side.

34:02.062 --> 34:02.672
So we can go check--

34:02.673 --> 34:05.136
Wait, that's-- that the son-in-law.

34:05.137 --> 34:06.293
Yeah, why?

34:06.867 --> 34:08.167
He is one of the hostages.

34:08.168 --> 34:09.967
He was having a seizure and...

34:11.264 --> 34:12.399
Oh, God.

34:15.733 --> 34:17.938
This is detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

34:17.940 --> 34:20.610
I'm checking in on a patient that
came in from a bank robbery.

34:20.612 --> 34:22.251
His name is Sal Martino.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.187
What?

34:26.188 --> 34:27.199
He did?

34:29.777 --> 34:31.728
He checked himself out
against medical advice.

34:31.728 --> 34:32.628
He's gone.

34:32.629 --> 34:35.717
It was him.
He orchestrated this whole thing.

34:36.476 --> 34:37.984
It turns out, Ron Brandt runs a company

34:37.985 --> 34:39.312
that supplies military contractors

34:39.313 --> 34:41.525
with special operational
forces from around the world.

34:41.525 --> 34:44.556
Ok, he uses his military connection to hire

34:44.558 --> 34:46.216
that team of mercenaries in the bank,

34:46.217 --> 34:49.473
and then to avoid loose ends,
Ron rigs the C-4 to blow early.

34:49.474 --> 34:50.639
Talk about cold blooded.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.261
And he did all of this
just for the contents

34:52.262 --> 34:54.359
of Agnes' safety deposit box?

34:54.360 --> 34:57.188
Castle, you said that there were
photos and letters in that, right?

34:57.189 --> 35:00.008
Yeah, trapper John must
have given them to Ron

35:00.009 --> 35:01.552
when he was being escorted
back from the restroom.

35:01.553 --> 35:03.810
Because right after that, he
faked a seizure and was let go.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.197
But why? I mean, what was so special

35:05.198 --> 35:07.619
about his former mother-in-law's
safety deposit box.

35:08.013 --> 35:09.279
Former mother-in-law?

35:09.280 --> 35:12.572
Yeah. Ron was married to
Agnes' daughter Tanya.

35:12.573 --> 35:13.819
Both her and her son Connor were killed

35:13.820 --> 35:15.544
in a boating accident about a year ago.

35:15.545 --> 35:17.159
No, no, Ron spoke about Connor,

35:17.160 --> 35:19.055
and he did not speak
about like he was dead.

35:19.056 --> 35:20.414
Connor is still alive.

35:20.415 --> 35:21.330
Well, I don't know what
to tell you, Castle.

35:21.331 --> 35:22.834
It says right here, Connor dead.

35:22.835 --> 35:23.994
I'm not so sure about that.

35:23.995 --> 35:26.239
It turns out neither his
wife Tanya nor Connor's body

35:26.240 --> 35:27.580
was ever recovered.

35:27.909 --> 35:29.352
Why would the wife fake their deaths?

35:29.353 --> 35:31.192
Domestic abuse.

35:31.219 --> 35:32.957
However, Ron had the connections

35:32.958 --> 35:34.873
and the wealth to avoid prosecution.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.653
So the system failed her.

35:37.187 --> 35:38.911
She and Connor couldn't escape Ron's abuse,

35:38.912 --> 35:40.840
so she faked their deaths and disappeared.

35:40.841 --> 35:41.455
Yeah, but to disappear,

35:41.456 --> 35:43.219
she had to walk away
from her former life...

35:43.220 --> 35:45.361
Sever ties with everything and
everyone she ever knew...

35:45.362 --> 35:48.161
Except she couldn't, especially
with her mother Agnes.

35:48.162 --> 35:50.265
Which is what the safety
deposit box was for.

35:50.266 --> 35:51.393
It means the communication.

35:51.394 --> 35:54.979
It's like a cold war drop box
in some John Le Carre novel,

35:54.980 --> 35:59.190
only Tanya wouldn't be able
to risk making the drops.

35:59.315 --> 36:00.993
So who would make the drops for her?

36:01.181 --> 36:04.580
Our mystery man who was posing
as Agnes' dead husband.

36:04.581 --> 36:05.649
He was Tanya's middleman.

36:05.650 --> 36:08.042
Okay, so Tanya sends the photos
and the letters to the middleman,

36:08.043 --> 36:11.007
then the middleman puts them in
the safety deposit box for Agnes.

36:11.495 --> 36:12.720
The box serves as a mailbox.

36:12.721 --> 36:13.932
Only it's better than a mailbox

36:13.933 --> 36:15.421
cause it's locked up in bank.

36:15.422 --> 36:17.377
Ron must have suspected
that they fade their deaths

36:17.378 --> 36:18.909
and that's when he bugged Agnes' home.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.314
When Ron found out about the box,

36:20.315 --> 36:21.658
he killed Agnes for the key.

36:21.659 --> 36:22.844
Right, and with the clock ticking,

36:22.845 --> 36:24.383
he hired that crew to
stage the bank robbery

36:24.384 --> 36:25.875
to get to the box with that key.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.581
You know, those photos and letters will say

36:27.582 --> 36:30.127
exactly where his wife and son are hidng.

36:30.128 --> 36:31.376
He's on his way there now,

36:31.377 --> 36:33.436
and we know what he's gonna
do once he gets there.

36:33.511 --> 36:35.768
He's gonna kidnap his
son and kill his wife.

36:43.861 --> 36:44.980
Identifying the middleman

36:44.981 --> 36:47.414
is the only way we're gonna be
able to find Tanya and Connor,

36:47.415 --> 36:48.571
so what do we know?

36:48.572 --> 36:50.694
He passed for Agnes' late husband.

36:50.695 --> 36:53.057
And it'd have to be someone
that Ron wouldn't suspect.

36:53.058 --> 36:55.443
That rules out friends,
neighbors and coworkers.

36:55.543 --> 36:56.543
It must be the private
person that they trusted.

36:56.835 --> 36:58.150
But the man could been paid.

36:58.151 --> 36:59.762
Maybe we could track their payments.

36:59.763 --> 37:02.832
You know, they're probably
smart enough to pay in cash.

37:02.876 --> 37:04.267
Which is untraceable.

37:04.268 --> 37:05.761
Unless, if paying by check

37:05.762 --> 37:07.829
wouldn't have thrown up any red flags.

37:07.830 --> 37:11.086
At the time of Connor and
Tanya's supposed death,

37:11.087 --> 37:14.442
she was making monthly tithe checks 
to St. Abigail's church.

37:14.443 --> 37:16.107
And who better fits this
profile than a priest?

37:16.108 --> 37:18.728
And I know which one we
should speak to first.

37:19.642 --> 37:22.023
The priest who officiated their funeral...

37:22.139 --> 37:23.571
Father Sean McCaskey.

37:24.081 --> 37:25.677
Father McCaskey, I'm
detective Kate Beckett.

37:25.678 --> 37:26.776
This is Richard Castle.

37:26.777 --> 37:30.152
We need to know where Tanya
and Connor Brandt are hiding.

37:30.189 --> 37:32.003
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:32.203 --> 37:35.475
Tanya and Connor have been
dead for over a year.

37:35.642 --> 37:36.969
Father, you don't understand.

37:36.970 --> 37:38.981
Agnes Fields has been murdered.

37:38.982 --> 37:41.151
Ron Brandt has the contents
of her safe deposit box.

37:41.152 --> 37:42.676
He's on his way to them now.

37:42.712 --> 37:43.749
What?

37:44.254 --> 37:45.669
How could this happen?

37:46.167 --> 37:49.079
That box was there to protect them.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.858
It didn't, father, but we can.

37:50.859 --> 37:52.310
We need to know their address.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.429
Of course.

37:53.457 --> 37:56.220
14 Cascadilla Street, Ithaca.

37:56.221 --> 37:57.978
Ithaca? That's only four hours away.

37:57.979 --> 37:59.351
Ron could already be there right now.

37:59.352 --> 38:00.804
- Thanks.
- Yes.

38:06.722 --> 38:07.622
Honey.

38:07.623 --> 38:08.687
I'm home.

38:14.304 --> 38:15.361
Stay back.

38:16.224 --> 38:16.927
I will kill you.

38:16.928 --> 38:20.133
Now, Tanya, is this any way
to greet your husband?

38:24.198 --> 38:26.257
Oh, no, honey. You bumped your head.

38:36.000 --> 38:36.998
There's my boy.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.000
Did you miss your daddy?

38:38.001 --> 38:39.999
Come on. Come on.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.208
Man, what the hell is taking so long?

38:41.209 --> 38:43.000
I can't believe they still got us on hold.

38:43.001 --> 38:45.999
Beckett, if he gets ahold of that kid...

38:46.000 --> 38:47.999
No! Mommy!

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
No, no, no, no.

38:49.001 --> 38:50.999
Please don't take him! Please.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Aah! Not in front of him, please!

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Baby.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.200
Why would I kill you?

39:01.444 --> 39:03.305
I want you to live and long, long life

39:03.306 --> 39:05.999
with the knowledge that you're
never gonna see Connor again.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.021
Now it's my turn to disappear.

39:08.271 --> 39:09.998
But unlike you, I know how to hide.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.000
- No!
- Come on, Connor. Come on. Come on.

39:11.001 --> 39:13.999
Connor! Connor!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.999
I got you. I got you. I got you.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Police! Don't move!

39:17.001 --> 39:18.181
Right there.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Think real hard about your next move.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.799
What?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.614
Okay. Thanks.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.002
- They found them.
- Yes.

39:33.174 --> 39:35.469
Tanya's gonna need a few
stitches, but Connor's okay.

39:35.470 --> 39:36.500
Come on. Let's go pick 'em up.

39:36.501 --> 39:37.468
Ithaca?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.999
Even as a hostage,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.380
I help you solve murders.

39:45.623 --> 39:47.000
Beckett, I think...

39:47.385 --> 39:49.000
I think you have the perfect partner.

39:49.490 --> 39:51.779
Yeah, except he doesn't
like doing paperwork.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Touche.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.000
So... old haunt?

39:55.378 --> 39:56.370
I'll buy you a drink.

39:57.000 --> 39:57.748
No.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
But I'll do you one better.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.999
Oh, Kate!

40:05.000 --> 40:06.999
Oh, darling, you can join us.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.999
Oh, you great, beautiful creature,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
come in.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.999
Oh, wow, Martha.

40:13.000 --> 40:13.999
You...

40:14.000 --> 40:15.999
You really...

40:16.000 --> 40:17.999
- outdid yourself.
- I did.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.999
Facing death demands celebrating life.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.999
Tonight we feast.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Where's Alexis?

40:23.001 --> 40:24.999
Oh, she's, uh...

40:25.000 --> 40:26.890
- Excuse me one minute.
- Yeah.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.000
- So yes?
- Please.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.999
Ash, it's not about today.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.999
It's about the last 100 days.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.999
You're never here for me.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.613
Just because you're in California

40:37.614 --> 40:39.000
doesn't mean I should
have to hold my breath,

40:39.001 --> 40:40.998
cross my fingers, and wish upon a star

40:40.999 --> 40:42.000
just to get a text from you.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, more excuses.

40:46.909 --> 40:49.617
Ash, I just can't do this anymore.

40:51.000 --> 40:51.769
We're done.

41:00.000 --> 41:00.781
You okay?

41:02.792 --> 41:03.464
No.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But ask me again tomorrow.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.882
Alexis, darling,

41:11.883 --> 41:14.880
help me with the duck
l'orange, s'il vous plait.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.443
Ah, thank you.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.999
And I didn't get a chance
to properly thank you

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
for saving my life.

41:24.001 --> 41:25.999
Oh, there's no need, Castle.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.534
We're partners. It's what we do.

41:27.535 --> 41:28.000
Yes.

41:28.001 --> 41:30.000
Some of us more than others, of course.

41:30.001 --> 41:32.000
Wait. What is that supposed to mean?

41:32.001 --> 41:34.999
Only that this is the eighth
time you've saved my life,

41:35.000 --> 41:35.998
and I've saved your life nine times.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.164
Okay, first of all,

41:37.165 --> 41:39.498
I can't even believe that
you're keeping score.

41:39.499 --> 41:41.999
And secondly, there is no way
that you've saved my life

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
more than I have yours.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.440
Nine? Please.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Well, let's review, shall we?

41:46.001 --> 41:48.999
The first time, I
distracted that mad gunman

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
with the champagne bottle.

41:50.001 --> 41:52.733
And, yes, that was a save.
Even you admitted it.

41:52.734 --> 41:55.999
Second time, the, um, serial killer

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
who put a bomb in your kitchen
while you were taking a shower.

41:58.001 --> 42:00.000
- I had to brave hellish flames...
- Sit, sit.

42:00.001 --> 42:01.999
To pull you out of your bathtub.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.923
I won't be forgetting that anytime soon.
