00:05.277 --> 00:07.043
Going to the
finals is ‐‐

00:26.665 --> 00:30.000
the competition just got a lot
tougher.

00:30.000 --> 00:44.082
The competition just got a lot
tougher.

00:44.082 --> 00:47.986
>> This is the most incredible
thing I've seen in one of these

00:47.986 --> 00:49.521
shows.
>> Absolutely magical.

00:49.521 --> 01:00.000
The world knows you could win
this.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.565
The world knows you could win
this.

01:00.565 --> 01:09.474
Simon cowell could
die.

01:09.474 --> 01:12.044
Live from
Hollywood, it's "America's got

01:12.044 --> 01:19.084
talent," the semifinals.
Here's your host, Nick Cannon.

01:42.007 --> 01:43.909
Hollywood, let me hear
you!

01:43.909 --> 01:48.747
This is "America's got talent,"

01:48.747 --> 01:50.515
and this week the math is
simple.

01:50.515 --> 01:53.718
There are just five spots left
in next week's finals.

01:53.718 --> 01:58.023
And tonight, 11 acts are going
to try to prove they deserve one

01:58.023 --> 02:00.000
of those spots.
Each week the challenge gets

02:00.000 --> 02:00.592
of those spots.
Each week the challenge gets

02:00.592 --> 02:02.727
tougher and tougher for the acts
that survive.

02:02.727 --> 02:06.164
And this is the biggest mountain
they've had to climb yet.

02:06.164 --> 02:10.235
We are in for an electrifying
night.

02:10.235 --> 02:13.171
Right now, we've got four
electrifying people.

02:13.171 --> 02:15.674
Give it up for the "America's
got talent" judges.

02:15.674 --> 02:22.981
So who's got what it takes to

02:22.981 --> 02:25.817
get to the finals?
There's only one way to find

02:25.817 --> 02:27.352
out.
Let's get to it.

02:27.352 --> 02:30.000
Here we go.
First up, a singer who was the

02:30.000 --> 02:32.057
here we go.
First up, a singer who was the

02:32.057 --> 02:36.361
golden buzzer pick of Louie
tomlinson.

02:36.361 --> 02:42.601
She's here to try to make it to
the finals to make Louie proud.

02:42.601 --> 02:46.471
From Baltimore, Maryland, here
is jayna brown.

02:46.471 --> 02:49.541
>> Music has always been a part
of me, my whole life.

02:49.541 --> 02:53.979
It feels like I'm floating or
flying.

02:53.979 --> 02:57.382
It's been tough on me and my
mom.

02:57.382 --> 02:58.783
We didn't really have a place to
stay.

02:58.783 --> 03:00.000
But now we're living with my
grandmother, and I got accepted

03:00.000 --> 03:04.222
but now we're living with my
grandmother, and I got accepted

03:04.222 --> 03:05.757
into a performing arts high
school.

03:05.757 --> 03:10.428
So things are really looking up.
I used to be kind of shy.

03:10.428 --> 03:14.900
I was like that girl who like
sat by herself during lunch, you

03:14.900 --> 03:16.768
know.
But "America's got talent" has

03:16.768 --> 03:23.909
brought me out of my shell.
If someone had told me a year

03:23.909 --> 03:27.212
ago that I would be performing
in the semifinals of "America's

03:27.212 --> 03:30.000
got talent," I would be like,
you're crazy.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.919
Got talent," I would be like,
you're crazy.

03:33.919 --> 03:36.454
It would be so amazing to win
"America's got talent," not just

03:36.454 --> 03:41.126
for me, but I would get the
opportunity to buy my mom a

03:41.126 --> 03:43.295
house.
I can now see this bright future

03:43.295 --> 03:45.564
ahead for myself.
And I am not ready to let this

03:45.564 --> 03:59.077
dream go.

Simon cowell.

06:20.218 --> 06:22.354
Can I be honest with
you?

06:22.354 --> 06:28.193
It wasn't great.
>> What?

06:28.193 --> 06:30.000
It was incredible.
That's how excited I am.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.901
It was incredible.
That's how excited I am.

06:36.901 --> 06:44.509
That was your best performance
by a clear mile.

06:44.509 --> 06:48.913
And what a contestant, what a
performance in the semifinal the

06:48.913 --> 06:52.384
week before the final.
This is the performance I

06:52.384 --> 06:56.154
genuinely believe you'll be
remembered for.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.391
Congratulations.
>> Thank you so much.

07:05.764 --> 07:09.667
you sound beautiful, you are so
above that pay scale as far as

07:09.667 --> 07:13.138
your talent goes.
I'll tell you go, you just set

07:13.138 --> 07:17.242
the bar for tonight.
And you set it high.

07:17.242 --> 07:23.848
- You've got a vote.
- Mel b.

07:23.848 --> 07:26.551
That was a really big
song to take on.

07:26.551 --> 07:30.000
But you have a big voice to be
able to do that.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.725
But you have a big voice to be
able to do that.

07:33.725 --> 07:37.162
Your vibrato, your delivery was
on point.

07:37.162 --> 07:40.031
- I love that.

07:40.031 --> 07:44.836
I love you, you
continue to rise, rise, rise.

07:44.836 --> 07:48.006
Every time we see you, you're
getting better and better.

07:48.006 --> 07:50.708
You have so much depth, so much
soul, love you.

07:50.708 --> 07:55.780

>> you're like a real life Harry
Potter, aren't you?

08:17.936 --> 08:23.208
>> Oh, my god.
>> You are my favorite variety

08:23.208 --> 08:27.378
act in this whole competition.
>> I think you're fantastic.

08:27.378 --> 08:30.000

you can mix it up.

08:33.117 --> 08:37.129
>> I think you are fantastic,
you totally blew my mind.

08:50.646 --> 08:52.814
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

08:52.814 --> 08:57.286
This is the semifinals tonight,
11 acts fighting for a place in

08:57.286 --> 09:01.023
next week's finals.
Follow your favorite acts,

09:01.023 --> 09:03.859
they'll be tweeting as they go
throughout the show, and so will

09:03.859 --> 09:07.362

Howie never stops tweeting.

09:07.362 --> 09:10.599
Find out what he thinks about
the acts and the other judges.

09:10.599 --> 09:12.122
Go ahead, get involved.

Taking the stage next are the

09:13.669 --> 09:16.238
youngest contestants left in the
competition.

09:16.238 --> 09:20.742
They're kind of a normal brother
and sister, but when they're

09:20.742 --> 09:24.379
performing, they're sensational
magicians.

09:24.379 --> 09:31.286
From destin, Florida, here's
kadan Bart rockett.

09:31.286 --> 09:37.159
>> We have to come up with an
idea for the finals.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.762
>> How about revenge?
>> Sounds good.

09:40.762 --> 09:42.122
>> There's a lot of magicians in
the competition.

09:42.122 --> 09:45.167
>> There's a lot of magicians in
the competition.

09:45.167 --> 09:51.640
Steven brundage is really good.
I feel like the saying two minds

09:51.640 --> 09:56.278
are better than one is true.
This round, we're going to try

09:56.278 --> 10:01.383
and work together.
>> Ow.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.852
>> Creating magic is a complex
process.

10:03.852 --> 10:05.487
It's going to be right here.
>> Right there.

10:05.487 --> 10:08.390
>> Right here.
>> We're having to work on our

10:08.390 --> 10:10.058
teamwork skills.
>> Did you get it?

10:10.058 --> 10:12.122
>> No, I didn't.
>> Rabbit?

10:12.122 --> 10:15.297
>> No, I didn't.
>> Rabbit?

10:15.297 --> 10:18.033
>> I thought you were supposed
to get the rabbit.

10:18.033 --> 10:22.704
>> She's very annoying.
>> Lunch is ready.

10:22.704 --> 10:30.245
>> We want to be the youngest
kids ever to have a magic show.

10:30.245 --> 10:34.149
The kadan and Brooklyn show.
>> I think it should be called

10:34.149 --> 10:37.886
Brooklyn and kadan show.
It should be alphabetical.

10:37.886 --> 10:40.055
>> How about we do the biggest
part of the act?

10:40.055 --> 10:42.122
>> Which is me, exactly.

10:42.122 --> 10:49.297
>> Which is me, exactly.

10:49.297 --> 10:53.368
>> Ever since we've been on
"America's got talent," all of

10:53.368 --> 10:56.672
our friends have wanted to be on
television too.

10:56.672 --> 11:03.879
Tonight they'll get the chance.
America, say hello to Ms. mcgill

One, two, three.
You chose Rebecca.

11:31.673 --> 11:35.577
This is a trick we taught Harry
Potter how to do.

11:35.577 --> 11:39.014
Ready, set, go.

11:39.014 --> 11:41.717

They're all going to be jealous

11:44.720 --> 11:50.258

come.

11:50.258 --> 11:51.326

13:43.772 --> 13:46.708
Great job, guys.
Howie, talk to them.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.845
Can I just say, this
whole idea, the concept of you

13:49.845 --> 13:53.081
is amazing.
The reason people like magic,

13:53.081 --> 13:57.385
even as an adult, it makes us
feel like a kid again.

13:57.385 --> 14:02.357
You put magic that makes you
feel like a kid, done by kids.

14:02.357 --> 14:04.926
It's amazing.
I think America will love it and

14:04.926 --> 14:08.697
hopefully they'll vote for it.
>> Thank you.

14:08.697 --> 14:12.122
I've got to be honest,
it wasn't the stickest of

14:12.122 --> 14:13.435
I've got to be honest,
it wasn't the stickest of

14:13.435 --> 14:15.904
performances.
Nevertheless, you made your

14:15.904 --> 14:18.240
whole entire class and your
teacher appear.

14:18.240 --> 14:23.411
What I liked, even though the
house was kind of falling apart

14:23.411 --> 14:31.853
a bit, you pushed your hands up
and carried on, that's true

14:31.853 --> 14:33.355
- professionalism.
- I think the two of you

14:33.355 --> 14:37.659
are the coolest kids, I'm sure
your teacher agrees that you

14:37.659 --> 14:41.963
deserve an "a" plus for this
performance.

14:41.963 --> 14:42.122
- >> Thank you.
- Simon.

14:42.122 --> 14:44.733
- >> Thank you.
- Simon.

14:44.733 --> 14:48.403
I don't know what Mel
was talking about, you made ten

14:48.403 --> 14:53.241
people appear out of a house
from nowhere.

14:53.241 --> 14:56.745
I also want to say something.
You know what, you two are so

14:56.745 --> 15:01.116
funny, and you've turned into
this great double act, you've

15:01.116 --> 15:03.985
got fantastic showmanship.
I thought it was actually your

15:03.985 --> 15:08.657
best trick, not trick, it's
magic, we've had from you so

15:08.657 --> 15:09.591
far.
Congratulations.

15:09.591 --> 15:12.122
- >> Thank you very much.
- All right, guys.

15:12.122 --> 15:12.427
- >> Thank you very much.
- All right, guys.

15:12.427 --> 15:15.964
This time you worked together.
You guys weren't attacking each

15:15.964 --> 15:17.699
other.
Can you get used to that or will

15:17.699 --> 15:24.873
it be back to sibling rivalry?
>> I think we'll get used to

15:24.873 --> 15:26.408
that.
There are some more people I'm

15:26.408 --> 15:30.779
going against, like you with the
shoes.

15:30.779 --> 15:32.580
>> I think yours are way cooler
than mine.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.450
Do you want to see these two in
the finals?

15:35.450 --> 15:37.218
Get to voting, America.

15:54.703 --> 15:58.540

The pressure is on for her and

the pressure is on for the crew
that has to get this stage

16:04.879 --> 16:08.483

Semifinals when we return.

at?

16:30.421 --> 16:34.492
Welcome back to "America's got
the semifinals.

16:34.492 --> 16:43.001
What are you pointing at?
The town of kemp in Texas only

16:43.001 --> 16:46.070
has a population of a few
hundred people, but one of them

16:46.070 --> 16:48.006
sings country.
Tonight her singing could get

16:48.006 --> 16:50.475
her a spot in the final.
Stop it!

16:50.475 --> 16:51.247
Here is kadie Lynn.

16:51.247 --> 16:57.315
here is kadie Lynn.
>> Making it to the semifinals

16:57.315 --> 16:59.617
is beyond my dreams that I could
have hoped for.

16:59.617 --> 17:03.755
To know that I have is
absolutely amazing.

17:03.755 --> 17:05.790
"America's got talent" doesn't
just mean a lot to me.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.660
It means a lot to my parents
too.

17:08.660 --> 17:14.932
They see how I'm accomplishing
all my dreams, it makes them

17:14.932 --> 17:21.247

17:21.247 --> 17:23.107
- happy to see how happy I am.

17:23.107 --> 17:25.610

Congratulations.

17:25.610 --> 17:29.480
>> When she sings, she sings
from her heart.

17:29.480 --> 17:35.253
>> You're our shining star.
>> My parents didn't adopt me

17:35.253 --> 17:38.790
until they were in their 50s.
Knowing that, I try to spend as

17:38.790 --> 17:42.527
much time as I can with them
because I never know what might

17:42.527 --> 17:44.796
happen.
>> We're so proud of you.

17:44.796 --> 17:48.266

realize that time is short.

17:48.266 --> 17:51.247
And you better grab it.
And appreciate it.

17:51.247 --> 17:52.704
And you better grab it.

tonight is actually one of my

17:55.840 --> 17:59.043
mom's favorite songs.
I've been practicing so much for

this next round, because I
really want to make it to the

Such a beautiful job.

- You were nervous, when

20:20.918 --> 20:21.247
you took that deep breath, I was
like, oh, my god, she's actually

20:21.247 --> 20:24.822
you took that deep breath, I was

20:24.822 --> 20:26.390

Throughout the whole of that

20:26.390 --> 20:28.125
performance you were strong and
confident.

20:28.125 --> 20:32.830
That takes a lot at 12 years old
in this part of the competition,

20:32.830 --> 20:35.766
to ooze that amount of
confidence.

20:35.766 --> 20:39.537
I urge everyone to vote for you
because you're our only country

20:39.537 --> 20:42.406
singer.
Pick up that phone and vote for

20:42.406 --> 20:44.275
her, everybody.
>> Thank you.

20:44.275 --> 20:48.212
- Heidi.
- I feel like you sang

20:48.212 --> 20:51.148
that so beautifully, so poised,
I have to remember that you're

20:51.148 --> 20:51.247
only 12 years old.
And your parents must be so

20:51.247 --> 20:53.384
only 12 years old.
And your parents must be so

20:53.384 --> 20:57.588
proud of you, will done.
>> Thank you so much.

20:57.588 --> 21:00.358
- Simon.
- Kadie, I am blown away

21:00.358 --> 21:03.694
by the fact that we've seen,
what is it, three performances

21:03.694 --> 21:07.865
so far, average age about 11 or
12, come out and just nail it on

21:07.865 --> 21:10.501
the semifinal.
And you just did the same thing.

21:10.501 --> 21:15.940
Perfect choice of song.
A lot better, by the way, than

21:15.940 --> 21:20.411
the performance you did before
where I thought the track

21:20.411 --> 21:21.247
swamped you.
Your voice particularly at the

21:21.247 --> 21:23.080
swamped you.
Your voice particularly at the

21:23.080 --> 21:25.283
end was really good.
Congratulations.

21:25.283 --> 21:28.753
- >> Thank you so much.
- Howie.

21:28.753 --> 21:31.222
This is the toughest
competition this year I have

21:31.222 --> 21:34.759
ever seen in the singing.
So it's going to be up to

21:34.759 --> 21:36.594
America to choose to see whether
you stay in.

21:36.594 --> 21:38.229
It's up to America.
You did all you can do.

21:38.229 --> 21:42.867
America, you vote.

Coming up, a crazy
juggling act when includes Simon

22:02.019 --> 22:03.588
cowell.
He's starting to get a little

22:03.588 --> 22:05.957
nervous.
And a truly innovative artist

22:05.957 --> 22:10.266
will be trying to win your vote.
It's Viktor kee, when we return.

22:24.098 --> 22:28.736
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

22:28.736 --> 22:30.738
Now, tonight 11 acts are taking
the stage.

22:30.738 --> 22:33.641
But the competition is fierce.
There's only five spots open in

22:33.641 --> 22:38.045
next week's finals.
So next tonight we've got a

22:38.045 --> 22:41.949
juggler who is taking the art
form to a whole new level.

22:41.949 --> 22:47.188
He is Viktor kee.
>> I grew up in Ukraine, during

22:47.188 --> 22:47.436
Soviet union times, right before
the system collapsed.

22:47.436 --> 22:53.060
Soviet union times, right before
the system collapsed.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.830
My father unfortunately left our
family when I was five years

22:55.830 --> 22:57.932
old.
It was at that time when I met

22:57.932 --> 23:04.205
my juggling teacher, Alex, who
treated me like his own kid.

23:04.205 --> 23:08.543
He became like a father to me.
He made me dream.

23:08.543 --> 23:11.946
He made me believe that there is
a bright future.

23:11.946 --> 23:17.418
He made me confident that I can
be different.

23:17.418 --> 23:17.436
The tragedy is that he passed
away before I got to the big

23:17.436 --> 23:22.056
the tragedy is that he passed
away before I got to the big

23:22.056 --> 23:24.859
stage.
I feel like I lost my father a

23:24.859 --> 23:26.394
second time.
Everything I have now, he left

23:26.394 --> 23:36.437
- it for me.
- I think you are

23:36.437 --> 23:42.643
probably the best juggler in the
world.

23:42.643 --> 23:46.113
>> Although he never saw me
perform on the big stage,

23:46.113 --> 23:47.436
tonight in some sense he will.
I want to make him proud

23:47.436 --> 23:50.051
tonight in some sense he will.
I want to make him proud

23:50.051 --> 23:52.820
tonight.
To make the semifinals would be

23:52.820 --> 23:57.191
a dream come true.
Tonight, I would like to share

23:57.191 --> 24:07.969
that with the audience.

26:23.471 --> 26:33.314
Viktor kee!
Truly amazing, Viktor.

26:33.314 --> 26:36.283
Wow.
Heidi, you're standing up,

26:36.283 --> 26:37.852
you're clapping, you're
cheering.

26:37.852 --> 26:44.258
- Talk to him.
- Viktor, everybody

26:44.258 --> 26:47.436
knows how of I like you and your
balls, I can watch it all day

26:47.436 --> 26:49.163
knows how of I like you and your
balls, I can watch it all day

26:49.163 --> 26:51.198
long.
To me, you're unbelievable.

26:51.198 --> 26:54.535
I remember you all season long
and for years to come, I think

26:54.535 --> 26:55.903
you're very special.
>> Thank you so much.

26:55.903 --> 27:01.108
- I love you too.
- Viktor, what you just

27:01.108 --> 27:04.912
demonstrated is what it takes to
be in my opinion a star, which

27:04.912 --> 27:10.451
is that you only have balls, but
you came out and you did

27:10.451 --> 27:14.221
something incredible each time.
It's a show, it's an

27:14.221 --> 27:17.158
imagination, it's different,
it's memorable.

27:17.158 --> 27:17.436
In my opinion, again, your best
performance you've saved until

27:17.436 --> 27:22.696
in my opinion, again, your best
performance you've saved until

27:22.696 --> 27:25.733
the semifinal.
You are a very unique person who

27:25.733 --> 27:30.004
has worked hard enough in my
opinion to deserve a place in

27:30.004 --> 27:37.411
the final next week.
>> Simon, to hear it from you,

27:37.411 --> 27:39.947
- thank you.
- You take juggling to

27:39.947 --> 27:44.852
another level, you are the
baryshnikov of jugglers.

27:44.852 --> 27:47.436
I love everything you do.
I stopped working out, I'm just

27:47.436 --> 27:50.558
I love everything you do.
I stopped working out, I'm just

27:50.558 --> 27:57.064

myself, because of you, young

27:57.064 --> 27:59.967
- man.
- You're so slick.

27:59.967 --> 28:04.338
I want to make sure people vote
for you to make sure you're back

28:04.338 --> 28:09.043
next week.
I can't even get my words out.

28:09.043 --> 28:12.146
- You're amazing.
- Viktor, good luck

29:05.065 --> 29:09.003
Here are four singers who have
overcome a lot of tough

29:09.003 --> 29:10.571
obstacles.
Can they keep the dream alive

29:10.571 --> 29:16.410

nothing you couldn't do.
Growing up in the city of

29:31.191 --> 29:33.394
louisville, you find quickly
that's not reality.

29:33.394 --> 29:36.130
>> When I was seven, I was in
foster care.

29:36.130 --> 29:41.635
And my mother was in prison.
I was allowed a weekly visit

29:41.635 --> 29:45.806
with my mother at this facility.
She brought a radio, it was a

29:45.806 --> 29:49.643
blue radio, I'll never forget.
She gave it to me.

29:49.643 --> 29:54.032
That's what I would listen to.
I remember just using music to

29:54.032 --> 29:54.181
that's what I would listen to.
I remember just using music to

29:54.181 --> 29:57.084
escape.
I have a sense of accomplishment

29:57.084 --> 29:59.253
right now.
If I could talk to the

29:59.253 --> 30:02.790
six‐year‐old me, I would tell
him one day all of this will be

30:02.790 --> 30:06.794
in the past and you'll look back
on this and it will help you.

30:06.794 --> 30:09.997
If I could tell that 6‐year‐old
that, it would be something,

30:09.997 --> 30:16.971
something special.

Wow.
Mr. Simon cowell talks to these

33:41.074 --> 33:45.345
- gentlemen.
- That was a stunning

33:45.345 --> 33:47.214
performance, stunning song
choice.

33:47.214 --> 33:51.351
The difference between where you
were before with kind of the

33:51.351 --> 33:54.032
karaoke record, now a song I
think you would actually make as

Perfect, great lyric.

33:58.926 --> 34:02.462
Everything you've done so far to
me means you deserve a place in

34:06.166 --> 34:08.602
Impressive.
Mr. mandel.

In the package it
said you were talking to your

34:12.606 --> 34:15.842
6‐year‐old self.
I want to talk to your

34:15.842 --> 34:18.912
6‐year‐old selves, all of you
guys.

34:18.912 --> 34:21.582
I want to tell you kids, you
made it.

34:21.582 --> 34:24.032
You should be proud.
I'm proud of you.

You should be proud.
I'm proud of you.

34:25.319 --> 34:29.122
You're inspirational, wonderful,
talented, always surprising.

34:29.122 --> 34:31.725
I agree with Simon, you've got
to vote, people.

34:31.725 --> 34:42.102
- They've got to be in the finals.
- Mel b.

34:42.102 --> 34:44.771
Let me just tell you,
from the first note you were in

34:44.771 --> 34:47.674
it to win it just now.
Where can you go from here?

34:47.674 --> 34:52.846
You started off so big and it
just got bigger and more

34:52.846 --> 34:54.032
beautiful.
You put boyz ii men to shame.

34:54.032 --> 34:56.483
Beautiful.
You put boyz ii men to shame.

34:56.483 --> 35:00.153
You are amazing.
Amazing.

35:00.153 --> 35:02.489
- Heidi?
- I really like you

35:02.489 --> 35:06.593
guys, you always come prepared.
I can feel that.

35:06.593 --> 35:11.431
You rehearse and rehearse.
Your song was a surprise, when I

35:11.431 --> 35:15.035
love.
Well done again.

35:15.035 --> 35:17.671
Simon says they deserve
a spot in the finals.

35:17.671 --> 35:18.672
America, do you agree?

35:37.257 --> 35:44.131
- >> Go have your say.
- Coming up.

35:44.131 --> 35:48.935
We are going to go where no
juggler has gone before.

35:48.935 --> 35:53.974
>> There's one judge we haven't
used yet.

35:53.974 --> 35:54.032
>> Mel b, any color you want.
>> Red.

35:54.032 --> 35:56.476
>> Mel b, any color you want.
>> Red.

35:56.476 --> 36:02.149
>> Right there on the bottom.
>> The one color you're thinking

36:02.149 --> 36:03.250
about is going to be the color
blue.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.687
>> He is right.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.287
Welcome back to

36:18.287 --> 36:20.791
"America's got talent."
We're live from Hollywood.

36:20.791 --> 36:26.997
Next up, the judges' wild card.
They have promised to put Simon

36:26.997 --> 36:32.669
cowell in their act.
The judges are excited.

36:32.669 --> 36:35.505
Simon, do you have any idea
what's going on?

36:35.505 --> 36:39.367
Why is everyone
cheering?

36:39.367 --> 36:39.376
Why is everyone
cheering?

36:39.376 --> 36:41.979
- We're so excited.
- My favorite part of

36:41.979 --> 36:46.016
- the show.
- Not to get you worried

36:46.016 --> 36:50.921
or concern, but I saw a whole
bunch of medics on the side of

36:50.921 --> 36:53.056
the stage.
Let's get to it.

36:53.056 --> 36:59.963
Let's see what they've got.
Here is the passing zone.

36:59.963 --> 37:03.634
- Simon, who is the wild card?
- I didn't choose it.

37:03.634 --> 37:07.971
Three of us agreed.
There was one act this season

37:07.971 --> 37:09.367
that tortured three out of four
judges.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.975
That tortured three out of four
judges.

37:11.975 --> 37:19.249
Passing zone is the act.
>> All season long Simon has

37:19.249 --> 37:22.285
been sitting behind his desk,
laughing and having a grand old

37:22.285 --> 37:28.158
time at the other judges'
expense.

37:28.158 --> 37:32.863
>> Guess what?

37:32.863 --> 37:37.134
It's Simon's turn.
>> Last time we were on, Simon

37:37.134 --> 37:38.869
said he wants more risk of
death.

37:38.869 --> 37:39.367
>> You know what, Simon,
sometimes dreams do come true.

37:39.367 --> 37:42.806
>> You know what, Simon,
sometimes dreams do come true.

37:42.806 --> 37:46.777
>> We have been working around
the clock, getting ready for

37:46.777 --> 37:51.882
this performance.
It's gone perfectly.

37:51.882 --> 37:54.251
Almost no mistakes.
>> Right.

37:54.251 --> 37:57.821
>> There was a mistake or two
along the way.

37:57.821 --> 38:01.191
>> If you're nitpicking.
>> We've nailed it now, finally.

38:01.191 --> 38:08.765
>> Yeah.
>> The other three judges,

38:08.765 --> 38:09.367
they're going to love this.
Sorry, Simon.

38:09.367 --> 38:12.569
They're going to love this.
Sorry, Simon.

38:12.569 --> 38:21.478
>> Thank you so much.

38:21.478 --> 38:24.715
>> Thank you, everybody.
>> Wow, that's too much.

38:24.715 --> 38:27.884
Thank you, folks.
This is amazing.

38:27.884 --> 38:29.753
>> Yes.
They're so beautiful.

38:29.753 --> 38:34.891
Let's not waste any time.
Simon, please, come up onto the

38:34.891 --> 38:37.394
stage.
Let's hear it for him.

38:37.394 --> 38:39.367
>> Give Simon a big round of
applause.

38:39.367 --> 38:40.864
>> Give Simon a big round of
applause.

38:40.864 --> 38:45.602
>> This is going to be fun.
>> Oh, my gosh.

38:45.602 --> 38:48.238
Simon, come on up here.
Watch your step.

38:48.238 --> 38:52.042
Welcome to the show.
>> Thanks for joining us, Simon.

38:52.042 --> 38:54.578
You are about to be a star of
the show.

38:54.578 --> 38:58.515
>> Just stand right there, a
little step forward, if you

38:58.515 --> 39:00.016
would.
Your part is very simple.

39:00.016 --> 39:04.488
All you have to do is put your
hands at your sides, head up

39:04.488 --> 39:06.790
straight.
>> You don't move, and nobody

39:06.790 --> 39:09.367
gets hurt.
>> Oh, my gosh.

39:09.367 --> 39:09.793
Gets hurt.
>> Oh, my gosh.

39:09.793 --> 39:13.864
>> Simon, you're going to see
flaming torches in front of your

39:13.864 --> 39:14.865
face.
>> That's right.

39:14.865 --> 39:18.802
>> Do not move backwards,
they're behind your face too.

39:18.802 --> 39:22.973
>> One at a time.
You talk, then you talk.

39:22.973 --> 39:26.376
>> All right.
This is going to be awesome,

39:26.376 --> 39:28.378
Simon.
>> Whoa, hold on.

39:28.378 --> 39:32.849
No, I got it, I'm fine.
I'm good, I'm good.

39:32.849 --> 39:34.017
>> John!
>> What?

39:34.017 --> 39:37.487
>> You dropped a torch.
>> I know, it just slipped out

39:37.487 --> 39:39.322
of my hands.
>> It doesn't matter.

39:39.322 --> 39:39.367
>> We weren't even juggling yet.
>> Come on, you know what

39:39.367 --> 39:43.360
>> we weren't even juggling yet.
>> Come on, you know what

39:43.360 --> 39:49.366
happens when you drop a to any.
>> Okay, just do it.

39:49.366 --> 39:52.836
>> How many shows is this going
to take you?

39:52.836 --> 39:55.372
I'm sorry, Simon.
>> It's old shirt.

39:55.372 --> 39:57.407
>> It's not that old.
Here we go.

39:57.407 --> 40:00.744
>> Hold still, face the front.
>> Are you nervous?

40:00.744 --> 40:04.281
>> Oh, no.
>> I wasn't really talk to you

40:04.281 --> 40:07.918
on that one.
>> Yes, I am, I'm very nervous.

40:07.918 --> 40:09.367
>> Can we just get on with it?
>> The important thing is,

40:09.367 --> 40:11.788
>> can we just get on with it?
>> The important thing is,

40:11.788 --> 40:14.057
Simon, we don't want you to be
uncomfortable or nervous.

40:14.057 --> 40:16.326
>> Not at all.
>> We want you to feel at home.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.595
We asked the other judges what
your house looks like.

40:18.595 --> 40:25.769
>> And they created a set right
here onstage that looks like

40:25.769 --> 40:31.341
your house.
Let's see how they did.

40:38.782 --> 40:39.367
>> That is beautiful.
>> That's so nice.

40:39.367 --> 40:41.918
>> That is beautiful.
>> That's so nice.

40:41.918 --> 40:44.454
>> Amazing.
>> It's so warm.

40:44.454 --> 40:46.656
>> It's how I pictured it.
All right.

40:46.656 --> 41:00.103
You know what, these are six to
somebody torchs.

41:00.103 --> 41:06.576
We're going to add plate
spinning and we'll have 15

41:06.576 --> 41:09.367
torches instead of six.
>> It's a little dangerous, but

41:09.367 --> 41:10.313
torches instead of six.
>> It's a little dangerous, but

41:10.313 --> 41:13.950
we have this for your
protection.

41:13.950 --> 41:19.189
>> The Kevorkian headgear.
>> Look straight ahead, Simon,

41:19.189 --> 41:21.892
if you would.
>> Oh, my gosh, it makes him

41:21.892 --> 41:25.562
look good.
>> Simon, we need you to hold

41:25.562 --> 41:28.164
one of these ordinary sticks.
>> Just ordinary sticks.

41:28.164 --> 41:32.035
>> In each hand, just like that.
Those will be for the plates to

41:32.035 --> 41:34.304
spin on.
>> This is how you're going to

41:34.304 --> 41:39.367
handle the torches.
>> Tighten that thing down.

41:39.367 --> 41:41.378
Handle the torches.
>> Tighten that thing down.

41:41.378 --> 41:46.283
>> Head up, chin down.
Chin forward just a little bit.

41:46.283 --> 41:49.853
There you go.
>> Nice and steady.

41:49.853 --> 41:53.256
>> Is that on tight now?
>> If you hold your head

41:53.256 --> 41:58.995
perfectly, you can pick up
wi‐fi.

41:58.995 --> 42:02.465

>> Can we get on with it?

42:02.465 --> 42:04.000
>> Chin down.
Okay.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.503
Right there is perfect.
Right there.

Perfect.
Nice and steady.

Perfect.
Nice and steady.

42:12.742 --> 42:16.279
risk of death.
>> No, I didn't.

I wanted to make a wish.

I really did.
That was great.

43:49.906 --> 43:54.844
I think that you guys are funny,
I think that you're agile.

43:54.844 --> 43:57.313
I think you're really skilled at
what you do.

43:57.313 --> 44:00.583

44:33.583 --> 44:35.418

Not you, sorry.

44:35.418 --> 44:39.122
I haven't laughed like this in

happens.

46:34.892 --> 46:42.600
From grand rapids, Ohio, al kiss alal alal
calysta bevier.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.371
>> I was laying in a hospital
bed, thinking will I make it?

46:47.371 --> 46:49.046
I wasn't the only kid in the
hospital getting chemo.

46:49.046 --> 46:50.742
I wasn't the only kid in the
hospital getting chemo.

46:50.742 --> 46:54.445
There's tons of other kids.
I ended up kind of being

46:54.445 --> 47:01.319
friends, but a lot of the kids I
had met in the hospital, they

47:01.319 --> 47:04.856
didn't make it.
I was one of the lucky ones who

47:04.856 --> 47:16.868
actually got out.
It's kind of hard.

47:16.868 --> 47:19.046
Now I'm celebrating my year
remission.

47:19.046 --> 47:23.574
Now I'm celebrating my year
remission.

47:23.574 --> 47:27.545
I didn't want to just walk out
of the hospital and go back to

47:27.545 --> 47:30.314
my life.
I want to be there for those

47:30.314 --> 47:32.016
kids.
I know the thoughts that are

47:32.016 --> 47:35.419
going through their head.
Am I going to get to grow up?

47:35.419 --> 47:38.990
I want to show them that you can
get through it and keep

47:38.990 --> 47:45.163
fighting.
In my darkest days I dreamt of

47:45.163 --> 47:49.046
doing this.
And to be on the semifinals on

47:49.046 --> 47:52.336
doing this.
And to be on the semifinals on

47:52.336 --> 48:00.778

that's my moment right now.

every time you perform, I want

I love the fact that you've been

50:39.303 --> 50:42.273
brave enough to share everything
with us over the last few

50:42.273 --> 50:43.975
months.
I think you're a fantastic

50:43.975 --> 50:46.911
singer.
That lyric meant a lot.

50:54.618 --> 50:58.189
- Howie.
- You know the song,

50:58.189 --> 51:03.194
the lyric, and the package that
preceded it, seemed to speak a

51:03.194 --> 51:05.129
lot deeper than what we just
watched.

51:05.129 --> 51:08.699
People come to Hollywood and
come on this stage to make it.

51:08.699 --> 51:11.002
And you said you didn't know if
you were going to make it.

51:11.002 --> 51:14.071
Making it means so much more
than becoming a star, than

51:14.071 --> 51:16.273
winning this contest.
It means living.

51:16.273 --> 51:19.046
You are a great example of

First of all, you are a
beautiful girl with a beautiful

That was a big song to take on,

51:42.700 --> 51:45.836
the production and everything.
You did hold your own.

51:45.836 --> 51:48.205

finals.

52:19.046 --> 52:20.571
finals.
If you want your favorite to 75,

you have to vote.
You can do it by phone or

Still to come, an illusionist

52:35.252 --> 52:39.356
attempts mind‐blowing magic with
rubik's cubes.

52:39.356 --> 52:40.337
And a pop singer has one song to
convince you to let him into the

52:40.337 --> 52:41.849

Stay right there.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.882
Welcome back to
"America's got talent," live

53:03.882 --> 53:07.886
from Hollywood.
Now, this next contestant uses

53:07.886 --> 53:11.389
rubik's cubes in his act.
And you will not believe what he

53:11.389 --> 53:15.326
can do with them.
He is Steven brundage.

53:15.326 --> 53:19.664
>> I've always been obsessed
with solving puzzles, figuring

53:19.664 --> 53:23.001
things out.
For me, solving problems is like

53:23.001 --> 53:24.772
navigating a maze in my mind.
When I was a little kid, I had

53:24.772 --> 53:26.104
navigating a maze in my mind.
When I was a little kid, I had

53:26.104 --> 53:28.773
this fire truck that I would
take apart and put back

53:28.773 --> 53:30.642
together.
I would do that over and over

53:30.642 --> 53:32.844
again.
As I got Orlando, I looked for

53:32.844 --> 53:35.413
puzzles and problems that were
more complex and intricate and

53:35.413 --> 53:44.189
harder to solve.
I started to do crossword

53:44.189 --> 53:50.128
puzzles, sodoku.
There are more ways you can mix

53:50.128 --> 53:53.598
up a rubik's cube than atoms in
the universe.

53:53.598 --> 53:54.772
It was the ultimate puzzle for
me.

53:54.772 --> 53:55.433
It was the ultimate puzzle for
me.

53:55.433 --> 54:00.338
What I'm doing tonight is
something I've never done

54:00.338 --> 54:02.540
before.
Every time it's been one or two

54:02.540 --> 54:04.842
cubes.
This time it's over 200.

54:04.842 --> 54:07.312
The biggest trick attempted with
rubik's cubes.

54:07.312 --> 54:09.948
When I started this competition,
it was hundreds of thousands of

54:09.948 --> 54:11.349
people.
Now it's down to 22.

54:11.349 --> 54:15.186
The more I move forward in the
competition, the more I want it.

54:15.186 --> 54:24.772
I'm one move away from making my
dreams come true.

54:24.772 --> 54:27.165
I'm one move away from making my
dreams come true.

54:27.165 --> 54:30.235
>> Thank you.
As a small child I could never

54:30.235 --> 54:35.640
imagine this tiny cube of colors
could lead me to the greatest

54:35.640 --> 54:38.643
stage on earth and the biggest
honor of my life, the semifinals

54:38.643 --> 54:40.678
of "America's got talent."
Tonight we're going to attempt

54:40.678 --> 54:43.381
something bigger than I've ever
done before.

54:43.381 --> 54:47.118
We have a giant tower of rubik's
cubes right here.

54:47.118 --> 54:51.189
We have over 204 rubik's cubes
stacked up.

54:51.189 --> 54:54.772
There's more ways to mix up this
tower than atoms in the known

54:54.772 --> 54:55.627
there's more ways to mix up this
tower than atoms in the known

54:55.627 --> 55:01.132
universe.
I want you to watch close.

55:01.132 --> 55:03.568
Any of
instead of doing something giant

55:03.568 --> 55:06.838
tonight, I thought we would
begin with everything started.

55:06.838 --> 55:11.676
Me and a single rubik's cube.
Simon, can you help me out?

55:11.676 --> 55:17.181
Here is my question, Simon.
Is that cube still mixed up?

55:17.181 --> 55:20.885
Absolutely.
>> We're going to mix it up,

55:20.885 --> 55:24.772
from completely mixed up, to
completely solved.

55:24.772 --> 55:27.625
From completely mixed up, to
completely solved.

55:27.625 --> 55:31.162
How did you do that?
>> This time we'll step it up

55:31.162 --> 55:35.033
just a bit.
We're going to do it one‐handed

55:35.033 --> 55:38.703
but twice as hard.
Howie, you'll catch it, both

55:38.703 --> 55:44.175
hands out, Howie.
Is that cube still mixed up?

55:44.175 --> 55:49.447
Yes, it is.
>> One handed behind the back

55:49.447 --> 55:54.772
- when Howie catches it.
- Oh, my god.

55:54.772 --> 55:55.953
- When Howie catches it.
- Oh, my god.

55:55.953 --> 55:59.557
That's amazing.
>> Hold on to these two.

55:59.557 --> 56:02.093
Mel and Heidi, I have two cubes
for you.

56:02.093 --> 56:10.068
Nick Cannon, join me I don't
know onstage, please.

56:10.068 --> 56:12.804
Nick, we have a deck of
celebrity cards.

56:12.804 --> 56:16.107
We have tom Hanks.
We have snoop dogg.

56:16.107 --> 56:20.044
Justin bieber, et cetera.
Beyonce.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.146
Emma stone.
You can see all the cards are

56:22.146 --> 56:24.772
completely different.
Nick, I want you to use your

56:24.772 --> 56:24.949
completely different.
Nick, I want you to use your

56:24.949 --> 56:26.284
intuition.
Whenever you get a feeling, I

56:26.284 --> 56:29.053
want you to stop on any card you
want.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.589
We'll deal them down in a pile
here.

56:31.589 --> 56:33.424
Say stop whenever you want.
>> Stop.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.826
>> Perfect.
Take that card.

56:34.826 --> 56:36.961
don't look at it yet.
Very important.

56:36.961 --> 56:43.501
If you stopped on the card
earlier, we would have got lady

56:43.501 --> 56:44.402
gaga
gaga.

56:44.402 --> 56:46.871
>> Nice.
>> One card later, we would have

56:46.871 --> 56:49.207
gotten the rock.
All the cards are completely

56:49.207 --> 56:51.809
different.
Hold your card close to your

56:51.809 --> 56:54.772
heart.
Judges, start mixing your cubes.

56:54.772 --> 56:55.046
Heart.
Judges, start mixing your cubes.

56:55.046 --> 56:58.649
Nick, you'll tell each judge to
stop in any order you want.

56:58.649 --> 57:03.788
If I took your cubes back with
my hand, you would accuse me of

57:03.788 --> 57:07.692
cube slight of hand.
I have an antique cube slight of

57:07.692 --> 57:10.628
hand device over here.
Nick, get started.

57:10.628 --> 57:14.399
>> Okay.
Mel.

57:14.399 --> 57:16.334
- Yes.
- Stop.

57:16.334 --> 57:19.937
>> Perfect, take it back.
Next one?

57:19.937 --> 57:24.442
Simon.
>> Thank you so much, Simon.

57:24.442 --> 57:24.772
Heidi.
>> Face down, perfect.

57:24.772 --> 57:27.078
Heidi.
>> Face down, perfect.

57:27.078 --> 57:30.415
- Last but not least.
- Howie, stop.

57:30.415 --> 57:33.851
>> Perfect.
All four cubes mixed up by the

57:33.851 --> 57:36.220
judges.
Nick, join me back by the tower

57:36.220 --> 57:39.524
of cubes.
Nick, we have one, two, three,

57:39.524 --> 57:42.627
and four.
We'll choose a hole.

57:42.627 --> 57:45.329
>> This one.
>> Place it right in.

57:45.329 --> 57:49.667
- We have one, three, and four.
- The bottom one.

57:49.667 --> 57:52.036
>> Which one?
There's two.

57:52.036 --> 57:54.772
Perfect.
One and four, which one do you

57:54.772 --> 57:54.972
perfect.
One and four, which one do you

57:54.972 --> 57:56.574
- want?
- Up top.

57:56.574 --> 58:01.746
>> Last but not least, the last
down in the corner near you.

58:01.746 --> 58:04.415
You decided everything, you
chose which holes, you told the

58:04.415 --> 58:09.854
celebrity to stop, Nick, I want
you to name your celebrity out

58:09.854 --> 58:15.726
- loud so everyone could hear you.
- Brad pitt.

58:15.726 --> 58:19.597
>> Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you Brad pitt.

58:19.597 --> 58:24.772
Wow.

58:24.772 --> 58:28.072
Wow.

58:28.072 --> 58:30.308
That's pretty
impressive.

58:30.308 --> 58:34.812
I have no idea how you did that.
Steven brundage.

58:34.812 --> 58:36.414
- Heidi.
- Yes.

58:36.414 --> 58:40.451
- It looks like me.
- Talk to him.

58:40.451 --> 58:43.354
I am so impressed in
so many ways.

58:43.354 --> 58:46.324
Your enthusiasm.
I feel like you are a really

58:46.324 --> 58:49.527
nice guy, but what I love the
most is how you come up with so

58:49.527 --> 58:53.798
many new and creative ways of
doing magic with your rubik's

58:53.798 --> 58:54.772
cube.
All done.

58:54.772 --> 58:55.500
Cube.
All done.

58:55.500 --> 58:58.236
- >> Thank you.
- Simon.

58:58.236 --> 59:02.173
Steven, you've made
the boring fascinating.

59:02.173 --> 59:05.042
I honestly think you are the
most improved contestant we've

59:05.042 --> 59:07.979
seen on this show so far.
I genuinely do.

59:07.979 --> 59:12.617
And all I can say is, thank you
to the American public for

59:12.617 --> 59:15.620
bringing you back.
Because we hadn't brought you

59:15.620 --> 59:17.755
into the finals.
And I think based on that we're

59:17.755 --> 59:20.858
going to see you next week.
Congratulations.

59:20.858 --> 59:24.772
- >> Thank you, Simon.
- Mr. Howie mandel.

59:24.772 --> 59:24.896
- >> Thank you, Simon.
- Mr. Howie mandel.

59:24.896 --> 59:27.798
I'm just thrilled
that Brad pitt looks like me.

59:27.798 --> 59:32.403
That looks more like me than
Brad pitt.

59:32.403 --> 59:34.405
It looks like Brad
pitt.

59:34.405 --> 59:36.340
And that's what I
love about it.

59:36.340 --> 59:41.746
That looks more like me than
Brad pitt.

59:41.746 --> 59:54.772
But in real life you
don't look like Brad pitt.

59:54.772 --> 1:00:01.465
But in real life you
don't look like Brad pitt.

1:00:01.465 --> 1:00:05.236
After the break, the
incredible clairvoyants get deep

1:00:05.236 --> 1:00:12.009
inside the judges' heads.
And a young contorsionist who

1:00:12.009 --> 1:00:14.679
will blow your mind.
The judges are going crazy as

1:00:14.679 --> 1:00:16.512
always.
Stay right there.

1:00:32.430 --> 1:00:34.415
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

1:00:34.415 --> 1:00:37.985
And tomorrow night, we'll get
the results of tonight's vote.

1:00:37.985 --> 1:00:40.922
Only five acts will go into the
finals.

1:00:40.922 --> 1:00:43.925
That means a lot of pressure and
a lot of nerves for the

1:00:43.925 --> 1:00:46.828
contestants as we find out who's
in and who's out.

1:00:46.828 --> 1:00:52.033
We've also got an exclusive
performance up on the stage, the

1:00:52.033 --> 1:00:55.222
sensational andra day will be
here, joined by dance super

1:00:55.222 --> 1:00:56.304
sensational andra day will be
here, joined by dance super

1:00:56.304 --> 1:01:00.575
stars blue journey, all tomorrow
night at 9:00, 8:00 central.

1:01:00.575 --> 1:01:03.244
Make sure year here.
Most of us have a pretty good

1:01:03.244 --> 1:01:06.013
idea where our arms and legs are
supposed to be.

1:01:06.013 --> 1:01:12.386
But this young contortionist can
twist and turn her body into

1:01:12.386 --> 1:01:16.591
ways that will blow your mind.
Will she get into the final?

1:01:16.591 --> 1:01:19.694
From cypress, California, here's
Sofie dossi.

1:01:19.694 --> 1:01:23.531
>> I was very different from all
the girls, most of my friends

1:01:23.531 --> 1:01:25.222
were shopping at the mall, going
to movies, going to the beach.

1:01:25.222 --> 1:01:26.000
Were shopping at the mall, going
to movies, going to the beach.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.173
I love all those too, but hand
bouncing and contortionist is my

1:01:32.173 --> 1:01:34.442
favorite.
I've always wanted to be a

1:01:34.442 --> 1:01:37.845
performer since I was little.
I used to put on a show for my

1:01:37.845 --> 1:01:44.385
parents called the Sofie show.
I would make tickets that would

1:01:44.385 --> 1:01:47.555
sell for a cent.
When I first started contortion,

1:01:47.555 --> 1:01:52.693
I totally needed a trainer.
I've never felt I needed a

1:01:52.693 --> 1:01:55.222
coach.
For me it comes naturally.

1:01:55.222 --> 1:01:56.097
Coach.
For me it comes naturally.

1:01:56.097 --> 1:01:58.533
Contortion is a beautiful art,
just like dance.

1:01:58.533 --> 1:02:01.402
People always ask me, does it
hurt.

1:02:01.402 --> 1:02:05.673
No, it doesn't hurt.
It actually just sort of

1:02:05.673 --> 1:02:11.112
happens.
I feel like I'm going to doing

1:02:11.112 --> 1:02:13.948
something completely different.
The farther you get into the

1:02:13.948 --> 1:02:18.386
competition, the harder it is to
impress the judges, because you

1:02:18.386 --> 1:02:21.022
have to keep stepping up your
game.

1:02:21.022 --> 1:02:25.222
My mom always told me to be 100%
100%.

1:02:25.222 --> 1:02:28.796
My mom always told me to be 100%
100%.

1:02:28.796 --> 1:02:36.103

made it this far.

Wow.
Amazing.

- Simon, what did you think?
- What do I think?

1:05:45.092 --> 1:05:49.096
I'll tell you what I think.
I was thinking about tonight,

1:05:49.096 --> 1:05:52.666
which is I've seen so many
performances this evening which

1:05:52.666 --> 1:05:55.222
comes from people's imagination,
people who aren't professionals,

1:05:55.222 --> 1:05:56.904
comes from people's imagination,
people who aren't professionals,

1:05:56.904 --> 1:06:01.208
you have used this ability
tonight to put on a show.

1:06:01.208 --> 1:06:05.079
It feels to me like I'm not
watching a talent competition.

1:06:05.079 --> 1:06:09.750
It feels like I'm watching the
Olympics, it was that good.

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:12.853
- >> Thank you so much.
- Honest to god, I'm so

1:06:12.853 --> 1:06:18.159
impressed with what you've done,
so impressed with your

1:06:18.159 --> 1:06:21.262
showmanship, the fact that you
want to do well with this.

1:06:21.262 --> 1:06:25.222
It was incredible.
>> Thank you so much.

1:06:25.222 --> 1:06:29.069
It was incredible.
>> Thank you so much.

1:06:29.069 --> 1:06:32.773
- Howie.
- I don't know if

1:06:32.773 --> 1:06:36.977
people can tell how you did it
over these glass disco balls, it

1:06:36.977 --> 1:06:40.080
was so dangerous, I was so
thrilled.

1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:42.516
- Vote, people.
- Mel b.

1:06:42.516 --> 1:06:46.053
I almost want everybody
at home to be here watching it

1:06:46.053 --> 1:06:48.689
live, when you're inches away
from us.

1:06:48.689 --> 1:06:51.659
It was to dramatic.
You're doing this just with your

1:06:51.659 --> 1:06:53.360
body.
It's so powerful.

1:06:53.360 --> 1:06:55.222
Shut up!
It's so powerful.

1:06:55.222 --> 1:06:56.063
Shut up!
It's so powerful.

1:06:56.063 --> 1:07:00.201
You are incredible, young lady.
By far the best performance of

1:07:00.201 --> 1:07:04.205
tonight for me.
It has to be.

1:07:04.205 --> 1:07:06.240
- Heidi.
- I love that you

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:10.110
changed it up a little bit, left
the Bow and arrow at home, and

1:07:10.110 --> 1:07:12.079
you focused a little bit more on
your contortion.

1:07:12.079 --> 1:07:16.283
We forget really how dangerous
it is, when you go up there,

1:07:16.283 --> 1:07:19.220
just hanging by your neck,
because it looks so beautiful

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:25.222
- and easy the way you do it.
- Awesome job, Sofie,

1:07:25.222 --> 1:07:25.392

- Awesome job, Sofie,

1:07:25.392 --> 1:07:27.828

People, Sofie needs you.

1:07:27.828 --> 1:07:30.865
We've got all kinds of ways for
you to get your votes in.

1:07:30.865 --> 1:07:33.500
There's no excuse.
Get online, use the app or grab

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:36.070
the phone.
However you do it, use your

1:07:36.070 --> 1:07:38.472

Remember, there are only five

1:07:38.472 --> 1:07:40.808
spots open in the finals, so
make sure your favorite makes

1:07:40.808 --> 1:07:42.643

1:08:02.730 --> 1:08:05.545
You can sing, you look good, you
have everything.

1:08:17.481 --> 1:08:20.951
Oh, yeah, welcome back.

1:08:20.951 --> 1:08:24.055
The semifinals.
Next up, an act that's left

1:08:24.055 --> 1:08:27.591
everyone totally bewildered
every time they've taken the

1:08:27.591 --> 1:08:28.926
stage.
Tonight they're hoping to leave

1:08:28.926 --> 1:08:38.335
you speechless all over again.
Here's the clairvoyants.

1:08:38.335 --> 1:08:40.219
>> A 60‐year‐old house at the
edge of the woods.

1:08:40.219 --> 1:08:41.505
>> A 60‐year‐old house at the
edge of the woods.

1:08:41.505 --> 1:08:48.179
>> In the woods we found a book.
>> When we opened it, our whole

1:08:48.179 --> 1:08:56.921
world changed.
It was about clairvoyancy.

1:08:56.921 --> 1:09:01.659
Our minds can connect as one.
The mind is like a forest.

1:09:01.659 --> 1:09:04.862
There are light areas but also
dark areas that we know nothing

1:09:04.862 --> 1:09:07.131
about.
>> We go to the hidden areas of

1:09:07.131 --> 1:09:10.219
the mind, places most people
fear to go.

1:09:10.219 --> 1:09:10.668
The mind, places most people
fear to go.

1:09:10.668 --> 1:09:16.006
>> In the hidden places of the
human mind, we have so much

1:09:16.006 --> 1:09:21.812
power.
And that's what we tap into.

1:09:21.812 --> 1:09:28.018
Our act always involved objects
that the audience was holding.

1:09:28.018 --> 1:09:30.421
>> 2017.
>> Yes.

1:09:30.421 --> 1:09:34.191
>> What?
>> But this time, for the

1:09:34.191 --> 1:09:38.662
semifinals, we'll tap into part
of the mind that they didn't

1:09:38.662 --> 1:09:40.219
even know existed.
Tonight we'll bring the mystery

1:09:40.219 --> 1:09:41.565
even know existed.
Tonight we'll bring the mystery

1:09:41.565 --> 1:09:53.177
of the woods to the stage of
"America's got talent."

1:09:53.177 --> 1:09:58.315
We'll bring you back in time to
an age before the Internet, when

1:09:58.315 --> 1:10:02.286
people went to clairvoyants to
get answers.

1:10:02.286 --> 1:10:05.189
>> We'll explore your most
intimate side.

1:10:05.189 --> 1:10:10.219
No worries, we won't reveal the
embarrassing moments, Howie, but

1:10:10.219 --> 1:10:10.261
no worries, we won't reveal the
embarrassing moments, Howie, but

1:10:10.261 --> 1:10:14.198
we'll start with you.
>> Howie, I want you to think of

1:10:14.198 --> 1:10:20.070
a question you always wanted to
ask Simon but you never did.

1:10:20.070 --> 1:10:24.608
Okay.
>> Now is your chance.

1:10:24.608 --> 1:10:27.511
Write down the question and make
sure no one else and no camera

1:10:27.511 --> 1:10:31.248
can see it.
Mel b, I would like you to think

1:10:31.248 --> 1:10:34.351
of a special person, someone you
haven't seen for a very long

1:10:34.351 --> 1:10:40.219
time, someone we could not know.
Focus on their initials and

1:10:40.219 --> 1:10:40.357
time, someone we could not know.
Focus on their initials and

1:10:40.357 --> 1:10:44.695
write them down.
Heidi, excuse me for getting

1:10:44.695 --> 1:10:47.298
slightly intimate.
I would like you to remember a

1:10:47.298 --> 1:10:53.804
kiss you once received and focus
on the location.

1:10:53.804 --> 1:10:58.776
Write the location down, where
you were at the time.

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:02.880
Fold the paper together and hold
on to them.

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:05.182
>> Simon, please step up and
join me.

1:11:05.182 --> 1:11:10.219
Again?

1:11:10.219 --> 1:11:10.454
Again?

1:11:10.454 --> 1:11:15.960
>> Now, imagine you walk down
the streets of London together

1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:20.731
with your family and friends.
Close your eyes now.

1:11:20.731 --> 1:11:24.702
You want to remember this time
for the rest of your life.

1:11:24.702 --> 1:11:27.671
So you look at big Ben, and the
hands on the clock are

1:11:27.671 --> 1:11:31.976
indicating a very specific time.
It's not on the hour, but what

1:11:31.976 --> 1:11:36.881
time do you see, Simon?
Name the hours and minutes now.

1:11:36.881 --> 1:11:40.219
Four minutes past
seven.

1:11:40.219 --> 1:11:41.018
Four minutes past
seven.

1:11:41.018 --> 1:11:44.555
- >> Which is 7:04 in America.
- Correct.

1:11:44.555 --> 1:11:47.424
Can I go?
>> No.

1:11:47.424 --> 1:11:50.928
>> Because, Simon, you imagined
yourself walking in London, but

1:11:50.928 --> 1:11:53.530
you were not alone.
We were with you.

1:11:53.530 --> 1:12:00.671
And we all saw the to ourwer, and we
all saw the clock, and indeed it

1:12:00.671 --> 1:12:04.575
said 7:04.
I know, you would not believe

1:12:04.575 --> 1:12:06.477
me.
That's why we set the clock

1:12:06.477 --> 1:12:10.219
before we started at exactly
7:04.

1:12:10.219 --> 1:12:13.384
Before we started at exactly
7:04.

1:12:13.384 --> 1:12:16.053
Keep this as a souvenir.

1:12:16.053 --> 1:12:21.058
Stand up, take your folded
pieces of paper as we

1:12:21.058 --> 1:12:23.827
demonstrate how things were done
150 years ago.

1:12:23.827 --> 1:12:29.199
Come with me.
>> Let's gather around the

1:12:29.199 --> 1:12:30.734
table.
Things may get slightly more

1:12:30.734 --> 1:12:34.071
intense now, but don't worry,
you can trust us.

1:12:34.071 --> 1:12:37.408
Simon, Heidi, you're here.
You just need to keep an open

1:12:37.408 --> 1:12:38.342
mind.
Maybe we can go to some

1:12:38.342 --> 1:12:40.219
interesting places together.
>> Howie, hand me your question.

1:12:40.219 --> 1:12:47.818
Interesting places together.
>> Howie, hand me your question.

1:12:47.818 --> 1:12:56.427
I will try to send your
question.

1:12:56.427 --> 1:13:00.397
>> You asked for a raise; Is
that correct?

1:13:00.397 --> 1:13:02.800
I asked Simon for a
raise.

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:07.204
>> Simon, now it's your time,
you can answer the question as

1:13:07.204 --> 1:13:09.139
- you wish.
- No.

1:13:09.139 --> 1:13:10.219
>> That was fast.
Heidi, give me your paper.

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:12.676
>> That was fast.
Heidi, give me your paper.

1:13:12.676 --> 1:13:18.382
This time I just feed to touch.
Give me your right hand.

1:13:18.382 --> 1:13:22.186
>> And give me your left hand.
I sense a rush of emotion, such

1:13:22.186 --> 1:13:24.989
joy.
Heidi, you're high up in the

1:13:24.989 --> 1:13:27.925
air, in an airplane; Is that
correct?

1:13:27.925 --> 1:13:29.994
It is correct.
>> What a beautiful memory,

1:13:29.994 --> 1:13:34.999
thank you, Heidi.
>> Please take Mel b's paper.

1:13:34.999 --> 1:13:38.402
There is a fire burning deep
within you, so I want you to

1:13:38.402 --> 1:13:40.219
burn her paper.
>> Okay, we can try this.

1:13:40.219 --> 1:13:46.777
Burn her paper.
>> Okay, we can try this.

1:13:46.777 --> 1:13:50.314
don't try this at home.
But I want you all to look into

1:13:50.314 --> 1:13:52.149
the candle.
Look into the flame of the

1:13:52.149 --> 1:14:00.357
candle.
Mel b, you're thinking of

1:14:00.357 --> 1:14:04.461
someone we could not know,
someone who influenced you when

1:14:04.461 --> 1:14:06.363
you were younger.
What is the first initial?

1:14:06.363 --> 1:14:10.219
>> I'm getting an "I."
>> The second initial?

1:14:10.219 --> 1:14:11.368
>> I'm getting an "I."
>> The second initial?

1:14:11.368 --> 1:14:19.510
>> The second is a "w" ‐‐ no,
it's a "b."

1:14:19.510 --> 1:14:22.946
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1:14:22.946 --> 1:14:27.051
>> Is it possible it's your
grandmother?

1:14:27.051 --> 1:14:29.953
Yes.
>> I wrote something down before

1:14:29.953 --> 1:14:32.523
the show started and put it in a
special place.

1:14:32.523 --> 1:14:34.591
>> Open your right hand like
this.

1:14:34.591 --> 1:14:38.762
I don't want to touch the
pendant at all.

1:14:38.762 --> 1:14:40.219
Tell us the first name you're
thinking of.

1:14:40.219 --> 1:14:44.134
Tell us the first name you're
thinking of.

1:14:44.134 --> 1:14:47.104
Iris.
>> Unfold the paper and let us

1:14:47.104 --> 1:14:55.479
- know what's written in there.
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

1:14:55.479 --> 1:14:58.515
Iris.
You are kidding me.

1:14:58.515 --> 1:15:03.353
That's my grandma.
>> Thank you so much.

1:15:03.353 --> 1:15:10.219
That was pretty spooky.

1:15:10.219 --> 1:15:16.500
That was pretty spooky.

1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:21.805
The clairvoyants.
Howie, was that real?

1:15:21.805 --> 1:15:24.274
This is amazing.
It's scary.

1:15:24.274 --> 1:15:27.511
It's weird.
I swear to everybody at home, we

1:15:27.511 --> 1:15:29.947
had no part of this.
And for me, this was my favorite

1:15:29.947 --> 1:15:32.549
moment of the night.
You've got to vote.

1:15:32.549 --> 1:15:35.119
You've got to put them in the
finals.

1:15:35.119 --> 1:15:38.822
This is beyond human.
>> Thank you, Howie.

1:15:38.822 --> 1:15:40.219
- Thank you.
- Mel b, you seem a

1:15:40.219 --> 1:15:42.326
- thank you.
- Mel b, you seem a

1:15:42.326 --> 1:15:46.663
- little spooked right now.
- I am so freaked out.

1:15:46.663 --> 1:15:50.801
I haven't seen my grandma, she
lives in the Caribbean, for nine

1:15:50.801 --> 1:15:54.204
years.
She was the first person that

1:15:54.204 --> 1:15:56.707
popped into my head.
The fact that you got the name

1:15:56.707 --> 1:15:59.476
right, the initials, that is
mind blowing.

1:15:59.476 --> 1:16:03.514
I'm really scared.
Amazing.

1:16:03.514 --> 1:16:06.817
- Heidi?
- I don't think we need

1:16:06.817 --> 1:16:08.785
a clairvoyant to know you're
going to be there next week in

1:16:08.785 --> 1:16:10.219
the finale.
>> We would love to.

1:16:10.219 --> 1:16:12.923
The finale.
>> We would love to.

1:16:12.923 --> 1:16:15.926
You amazed us all
season and you did it again

1:16:15.926 --> 1:16:17.728
today.
>> Thank you so much.

1:16:17.728 --> 1:16:23.400
- Simon.
- It's like being in a

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:25.369
ghost movie with you two,
genuinely.

1:16:25.369 --> 1:16:28.305
We were so close, we could see
everything happening in front of

1:16:28.305 --> 1:16:29.239
us.
There were no tricks.

1:16:29.239 --> 1:16:31.542
You obviously have special
powers.

1:16:31.542 --> 1:16:35.445
God only knows what you could do
if you make the final.

1:16:35.445 --> 1:16:40.219
And again, where I applaud you
is that it's more than your

1:16:40.219 --> 1:16:40.284
and again, where I applaud you
is that it's more than your

1:16:40.284 --> 1:16:42.819
powers.
It's the fact that you put on

1:16:42.819 --> 1:16:47.324
this really delicious creepy
show.

1:16:47.324 --> 1:16:50.194
And everything we've seen, I'm
with these three, I think the

1:16:50.194 --> 1:16:52.563
final just wouldn't be the same
without you, and you probably

1:16:52.563 --> 1:16:55.899
know that already.
>> Thank you so much.

1:16:55.899 --> 1:16:58.835
- Thank you.
- Deliciously creepy.

1:16:58.835 --> 1:17:02.105
So if you guys were to make it
to the finals, how would you use

1:17:02.105 --> 1:17:05.609
your powers?
>> Next time I think we'll try

1:17:05.609 --> 1:17:07.711
to amaze and entertain all of
America.

1:17:07.711 --> 1:17:10.219
>> And step it up, of course.
We try.

1:17:10.219 --> 1:17:11.148
>> And step it up, of course.
We try.

1:17:11.148 --> 1:17:25.062
Good luck tonight,
awesome job.

1:17:25.062 --> 1:17:28.165
Get online, pick up the
phone, use the app, they need

1:17:28.165 --> 1:17:30.067
you.
Coming up, the last act of the

1:17:30.067 --> 1:17:32.035
week.
In a couple of minutes, the

1:17:32.035 --> 1:17:33.237
pressure will be on singer Brian
Justin crum.

1:17:33.237 --> 1:17:35.767
We'll be right back.

1:17:46.039 --> 1:17:48.562
Welcome to "America's

1:17:48.562 --> 1:17:52.499
the semifinals.
We're one week away from finding

1:17:52.499 --> 1:17:56.369
out who's going to win the best
prize on the planet.

1:17:56.369 --> 1:18:00.774
First you win $1 million, then
you get to headline a show in

1:18:00.774 --> 1:18:02.442
the entertainment capital of the
world, las Vegas.

1:18:02.442 --> 1:18:06.947
This year the show will be at
planet Hollywood resort and

1:18:06.947 --> 1:18:10.723
casino on October 27th, 28th,
and 29th.

1:18:10.723 --> 1:18:11.251
Casino on October 27th, 28th,
and 29th.

1:18:11.251 --> 1:18:18.225
Head over to nbc.Com/agtlive for
tickets and everything else you

1:18:18.225 --> 1:18:20.126
need to know.
Can we keep it going?

1:18:20.126 --> 1:18:23.730
The last act of the semifinals.
Last time out this singer got a

1:18:23.730 --> 1:18:25.565
standing ovation from our
judges.

1:18:25.565 --> 1:18:27.801
Tonight he needs a vote from all
over America.

1:18:27.801 --> 1:18:32.372
From los Angeles, California,
here is Brian Justin crum.

1:18:32.372 --> 1:18:36.109
>> Moving to l. A., everyone
comes with the biggest dreams.

1:18:36.109 --> 1:18:38.912
Only one in a million are going
to make it.

1:18:38.912 --> 1:18:40.723
I've always hoped that I could
be one of those people.

1:18:40.723 --> 1:18:44.718
I've always hoped that I could
be one of those people.

1:18:44.718 --> 1:18:48.355
I've really been doing whatever
I can to make money, make ends

1:18:48.355 --> 1:18:50.891
meet.
I've driven for a car service.

1:18:50.891 --> 1:18:53.026
I was driving people to a big
audition.

1:18:53.026 --> 1:18:54.928
I was chauffeuring people to
their dream.

1:18:54.928 --> 1:18:59.499
And it was really hard for me to
not have that for myself.

1:18:59.499 --> 1:19:03.837
I got to a place a few different
times where I thought maybe this

1:19:03.837 --> 1:19:06.673
isn't going to happen for me.
It took everything inside of me

1:19:06.673 --> 1:19:10.410
to say no, to trust that this is
where I'm supposed to be.

1:19:10.410 --> 1:19:10.723
And this is what I'm meant to
do.

1:19:10.723 --> 1:19:12.679
And this is what I'm meant to
do.

1:19:12.679 --> 1:19:16.783
You spend years and years
fighting and trying so hard to

1:19:16.783 --> 1:19:23.089
make your dreams happen, and
then in one night, it's all

1:19:23.089 --> 1:19:27.661
- changed.
- This is why these

1:19:27.661 --> 1:19:31.131
shows exist, to give people like
you an opportunity.

1:19:31.131 --> 1:19:34.567
>> The only thing that makes me
feel alive.

1:19:34.567 --> 1:19:39.339
I want to win this so bad.
I need to win this.

1:19:39.339 --> 1:19:40.723
I'm going to do everything that
I can to make it happen.

1:19:40.723 --> 1:19:47.881
I'm going to do everything that
I can to make it happen.

The whole building on their
feet, including Mel b.

1:22:21.534 --> 1:22:24.237
- Talk to him.
- When Beyonce came on in

1:22:24.237 --> 1:22:30.477
the vmas, nobody else mattered.
Nobody else mattered right now.

1:22:30.477 --> 1:22:34.147
That was incredible.
Perfection from start to end.

I feel every note.
You fill up this whole room.

- Amazing.
- Heidi.

1:22:45.191 --> 1:22:49.696
I agree with you, Mel.
It was such a passionate and

1:22:49.696 --> 1:22:51.965
intense performance.
Vote for him, because you have

1:22:51.965 --> 1:22:54.767
to be here next week.
You have to.

1:22:54.767 --> 1:22:59.873
- Simon cowell.
- I didn't think it was

1:22:59.873 --> 1:23:02.375
perfect.
I liked the start of the track,

1:23:02.375 --> 1:23:04.878
to be honest with you.
I thought your found your pace

1:23:04.878 --> 1:23:07.413
in the midway.
I thought the second half of the

1:23:07.413 --> 1:23:10.723
performance was exceptional.
Again, what's so impressive but

1:23:10.723 --> 1:23:13.653
performance was exceptional.
Again, what's so impressive but

1:23:13.653 --> 1:23:16.289
about you is you were this shy
thing I remember at the

1:23:16.289 --> 1:23:17.891
audition.
Obviously you got a bit beaten

1:23:17.891 --> 1:23:21.127
up in the music industry, like
you said in your film, is it

1:23:21.127 --> 1:23:24.464
your time.
I do believe it's your time now,

1:23:24.464 --> 1:23:26.566
Brian.
I think you've found it, and

1:23:26.566 --> 1:23:28.735
you've turned into more than a
singer.

1:23:28.735 --> 1:23:33.139
You've turned into a performer.
You've got your confidence.

1:23:33.139 --> 1:23:36.776
I have a feeling America is
going to get behind you and

1:23:36.776 --> 1:23:39.212
we're going to see you in the
finals next week.

1:23:39.212 --> 1:23:40.723
Howie?

1:23:40.723 --> 1:23:43.816
Howie?

1:23:43.816 --> 1:23:46.452
I believe in
everything my cohorts have said

1:23:46.452 --> 1:23:48.321
here.
I believe that you are ruling

1:23:48.321 --> 1:23:51.457
the world tonight.
I believe ‐‐ this is the tough

1:23:51.457 --> 1:23:53.560
part.
The tough part is 11 people

1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:57.030
performed tonight, only five can
go through.

1:23:57.030 --> 1:23:58.831
You can't take it for granted,
America.

1:23:58.831 --> 1:24:02.135
This was truly the strongest,
best performance of the night.

1:24:02.135 --> 1:24:05.838
You owned it.
There was no nerves.

1:24:05.838 --> 1:24:10.723
But this is when America has the
responsibility, only five out of

1:24:10.723 --> 1:24:11.077
but this is when America has the
responsibility, only five out of

1:24:11.077 --> 1:24:14.047
- 11 went through.
- We know.

1:24:14.047 --> 1:24:15.949
But we've got to
drive that home.

1:24:15.949 --> 1:24:20.153
You were the best tonight.
What a way to end the show.

1:24:20.153 --> 1:24:21.688
- Wow.
- How does it feel?

1:24:21.688 --> 1:24:23.423
>> Amazing.
I love you guys.

1:24:23.423 --> 1:24:27.493
Thank you guys so much.
America, thank you, vote for me!

1:24:27.493 --> 1:24:30.697
Good luck tonight.
This is what we're going to do.

1:24:30.697 --> 1:24:35.268
The acts have done all they can.
Now it's over to you, America.

1:24:35.268 --> 1:24:38.338
Keep voting and make sure your
favorites are in the finals.

1:24:38.338 --> 1:24:40.723
You've got until 7:00 a. M.
Eastern tomorrow night.

1:24:40.723 --> 1:24:40.940
You've got until 7:00 a. M.
Eastern tomorrow night.

1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:46.112
We'll find out who will be
fighting for $1 million in next

1:24:46.112 --> 1:24:48.248
week's finals.
Blue's journey will be here.

1:24:48.248 --> 1:24:51.951
It all starts at 9:00, 8:00
central.

1:24:51.951 --> 1:24:55.955
don't move, because coming up
right now is Henry winkler,

1:24:55.955 --> 1:25:00.260
Terry bradshaw, and George
foreman on their crazy

1:25:00.260 --> 1:25:02.629
adventure, "better late than
never."

1:25:02.629 --> 1:25:04.399
Good night, America.
