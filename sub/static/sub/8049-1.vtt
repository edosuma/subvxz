03:10.180 --> 03:11.680
Good morning.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.510
Good morning, Doctor.

03:13.930 --> 03:17.850
Mr. Rane, would you like one last look 
at your face before I proceed?

03:18.190 --> 03:20.270
I never live in the past.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.650
No, thank you.

03:25.690 --> 03:28.070
I have to give you something for the pain.

03:28.150 --> 03:29.820
There will be no pain.

03:32.410 --> 03:33.410
Proceed.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.350
Scalpel.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.880
All right. You know the drill. 
Be very careful.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.079
This is Charles Rane we're dealing with.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.790
-Where is he? 
 -Plastic Surgery. Third floor.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.459
He keeps changing his face.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.130
If we blow this, 
 we won't get another chance.

04:24.210 --> 04:25.500
Move out!

04:29.210 --> 04:30.710
What time is it?

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
What?

04:32.130 --> 04:34.510
I want you to tell me what time it is.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.230
Twelve o'clock.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.070
Get down!

05:08.920 --> 05:10.500
Move it out there!

05:12.260 --> 05:13.810
Stairs! Other way!

05:47.290 --> 05:49.460
Don't move! Freeze! Don't move!

05:51.130 --> 05:52.880
Charles Rane, FBI.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.100
You're under arrest.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.000
Enjoy the flight.

06:41.220 --> 06:42.810
-There you go. 
 -Thanks.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.180
You're welcome.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.640
Listen up! Shut up! Sit!

06:50.020 --> 06:54.160
Do as I say and nobody gets hurt. 
 You have the keys to the flight deck?

06:54.230 --> 06:57.160
We're going to move there, nice and slow.

06:57.570 --> 06:59.570
Don't make me use this.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.500
Nice and slow.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.750
There you go.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.750
Real nice.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.800
Real nice.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.600
Turn it off.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.890
May I ask you what you were doing?

07:27.980 --> 07:30.850
I was improvising 
 on your security techniques.

07:31.690 --> 07:34.190
That's cute. That's real cute, Miss...?

07:34.270 --> 07:36.860
Slayton, but my friends call me Marti.

07:37.030 --> 07:38.530
Well. See...

07:39.110 --> 07:43.280
...if this had been a real gun, that 
 Angie Dickinson bullshit you just pulled...

07:43.370 --> 07:44.950
...would've got your head blown off.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.450
And endangered the lives 
 of all the other passengers.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.370
I was trying to save lives.

07:49.830 --> 07:53.830
The next time a man holds a gun 
 to your head on a crowded plane...

07:53.960 --> 07:55.540
...you follow instructions.

07:55.630 --> 07:59.420
You do exactly what he tells you to do. 
 Do you understand?

08:00.010 --> 08:01.640
This is why I gave up my afternoon?

08:01.720 --> 08:04.970
So a former security specialist 
 can tell me how to obey a hijacker?

08:05.060 --> 08:07.640
First of all, I'm not a "former" anything.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.100
Second of all, I like what I do.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.730
I get the chance to meet people like you.

08:12.850 --> 08:17.270
I know we got a lot of information 
 to think about, so class dismissed.

08:17.690 --> 08:20.070
We'll hijack you again next week.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.910
-What the hell are you doing here? 
 -I'm doing fine. How're you?

08:26.990 --> 08:28.120
What's wrong with your foot?

08:28.620 --> 08:31.210
I appreciate you throwing some business 
 my way...

08:31.290 --> 08:33.669
...but you have no right to interfere 
 with my class.

08:33.750 --> 08:37.090
Look around. 
 This is an airline training facility.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.919
This is not the Secret Service. Calm down.

08:40.010 --> 08:42.049
Now you're telling me my job, too?

08:42.130 --> 08:43.880
What she did was wrong. Period.

08:43.970 --> 08:47.390
There was a time you'd have let her know 
 without blowing your cool.

08:47.470 --> 08:50.180
It just dawned on me. 
 She kind of reminds me of Lisa.

08:50.270 --> 08:51.480
She looks nothing like Lisa.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.020
I didn't say she looked like her, 
 I said she reminded me of her.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.270
-We gotta talk. 
 -I'm not interested in coming back.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.190
-Did I ask you to? 
 -You were about to.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.370
Don't tell me teaching security techniques 
 to bodyguards...

09:02.450 --> 09:05.460
...night watchmen and flight attendants 
 is what you want to do.

09:05.530 --> 09:07.000
It's a job, Sly. I like it.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.450
Ramsey wants me to hire 
 the best person available...

09:09.540 --> 09:12.250
...to head up the counter-terrorism unit. 
 That'd be you.

09:12.330 --> 09:13.910
I don't want that responsibility.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.840
I don't wanna be so good-looking, 
 but I deal with the hand that's dealt me.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.210
Nobody can do the job better than you.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.470
I knew you'd start this shit again. 
 Give me my check.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.720
-You want me to stop? 
 -Yes.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.730
Just say, "Yes, I'll take the job." I'll stop.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.560
Dammit, Sly. Give it a rest.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.220
No, you give it a rest.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.890
This isn't about a job. This is about you.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.940
Nobody knows better than I do 
 how much Lisa meant to you...

09:37.020 --> 09:38.900
...but you gotta stop blaming yourself.

09:38.980 --> 09:42.650
You gotta get off the sidelines 
 and back into this game!

09:43.240 --> 09:47.160
I set up a lunch tomorrow with Ramsey 
 at 12:00 at The Oxford.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.990
I hope you'll be there.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.500
I really do.

10:07.510 --> 10:08.980
Hey, pretty boy!

10:11.010 --> 10:13.220
Who's that pretty-assed white girl?

10:13.310 --> 10:14.730
What's her name?

10:29.370 --> 10:31.120
Attorney Phillips.

10:32.660 --> 10:35.510
Have you found out 
 where they intend to take me?

10:35.910 --> 10:38.680
Los Angeles. But they won't say when.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.750
It'll happen quickly.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.590
Notify my people. 
 They'll know what to do.

10:44.090 --> 10:45.920
California has a death penalty.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.090
It's a progressive state.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.680
I'll have to visit it sometime.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.100
The Feds' witness can prove 
 you're responsible...

10:53.180 --> 10:55.390
...for two airline bombings in the past year.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.240
I'm responsible for twice that amount.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.530
I'm afraid the most we can hope for 
 is that I claim insanity for you.

11:05.110 --> 11:08.950
Given your childhood history, 
 we should be able to make that stick.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.200
Never mention my childhood.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.290
Have I made myself clear?

11:18.120 --> 11:21.790
It is the nature of man to confuse genius 
 with insanity.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.130
Now...

11:26.590 --> 11:28.390
...repeat after me.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.970
Charles Rane...

11:34.220 --> 11:35.640
...is not...

11:35.970 --> 11:37.360
...insane.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.480
"Charles Rane...

11:43.020 --> 11:44.740
"...is not insane."

11:48.070 --> 11:49.280
Again.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.910
"Charles Rane...

11:52.780 --> 11:54.500
"...is not insane."

11:57.000 --> 11:58.330
Continue.

11:59.000 --> 11:59.960
"Charles...

12:00.670 --> 12:02.380
"...Rane is not...

12:03.590 --> 12:04.920
<i>"...insane. "</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:16.850
<i>Put some of this on the fire. Okay?</i>

12:16.930 --> 12:18.020
<i>Kiss.</i>

12:20.100 --> 12:21.440
<i>Fine ass.</i>

12:29.110 --> 12:30.530
<i>Merry Christmas, motherfucker!</i>

12:30.610 --> 12:32.610
<i>Open the register. Give me the money!</i>

12:32.700 --> 12:35.870
<i>Shut up! Give it to me now!</i> 
 <i>Open the register! Now!</i>

12:36.160 --> 12:37.580
<i>Freeze! Drop it!</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:44.050
<i>Get back or I'll blow this bitch's head off!</i> 
 <i>Get back!</i>

12:44.460 --> 12:47.170
<i>Get the fuck back! Put the gun down!</i>

12:47.630 --> 12:49.380
<i>Put the fucking gun down!</i>

12:50.880 --> 12:53.050
<i>All right. I'm putting it down.</i>

12:53.180 --> 12:55.140
<i>You just stay cool, all right.</i>

12:56.810 --> 13:00.060
<i>You're gonna be all right, baby.</i> 
 <i>I'm not gonna try and stop you.</i>

13:00.140 --> 13:03.150
<i>You shouldn't have tried to stop me</i> 
 <i>the first time.</i>

13:10.990 --> 13:12.540
<i>Oh, my God! Lisa!</i>

13:15.410 --> 13:16.570
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

13:16.740 --> 13:19.910
<i>It's going to be all right. It's not too bad.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.370
<i>Oh, what have I done?</i>

14:37.410 --> 14:38.790
What do you know?

14:38.870 --> 14:40.160
Here he is.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.490
-John Cutter, Stuart Ramsey. 
 -Pleasure.

14:43.580 --> 14:47.330
Nice to meet you. 
 Mr. Delvecchio said you might not come.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.580
Well, Mr. Delvecchio was wrong.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.180
Let's have a seat.

14:51.670 --> 14:55.810
Do you know how many airlines 
 have been hijacked in the last three years?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.630
-No. 
 -Twenty-seven.

14:58.340 --> 15:02.820
Almost every commercial airline in 
 the world has had to cope with terrorism.

15:03.430 --> 15:04.720
All except one.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.480
The Israelis have never been fucked with.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.770
They never let them on the plane.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.110
Do you have any thoughts on this?

15:12.190 --> 15:16.610
Unequivocally, without a doubt, 
 John is the best guy I ever worked with.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.120
The annual meeting of our stockholders 
 is next week in Los Angeles.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.450
I'd like to fly out a couple days early, 
 have a brief vacation...

15:26.540 --> 15:28.870
...before I introduce you as...

15:29.370 --> 15:31.130
...our new vice-president.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.380
That is assuming you still want the job.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.550
I'll drink to that.

15:46.810 --> 15:50.770
When you meet this board of directors, 
 you should think of something really...

15:50.850 --> 15:53.730
...impressive to say to start things off.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.150
Maybe I'll ask them to fire you.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.830
Actually, this isn't a good time to start 
 with new plans.

15:59.910 --> 16:02.490
Just be yourself: dignified and charming.

16:03.990 --> 16:05.870
Sorry, sir. You'll have to go back through.

16:05.950 --> 16:08.160
Are you carrying any metal objects?

16:08.250 --> 16:11.420
Ever notice how the real suspicious ones 
 never have any trouble?

16:11.500 --> 16:14.210
Right. That's how they get on the plane.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.170
Oh, man.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.340
Sorry, I'm gonna have to check you myself.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.850
It's that metal plate in his head. 
 An old war wound.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.430
You can go with your friend now.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.890
Thank you.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.480
You're welcome.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.440
Real quick. How do you do that?

16:36.780 --> 16:39.190
Before you get on the plane, 
 how do you do that?

16:39.280 --> 16:42.530
-It's a black thing. 
 - I understand black things.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.070
That's what I admire about you.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.660
Even though you were being hit on 
 by an absolutely beautiful woman...

16:48.750 --> 16:51.460
...you are determined to maintain 
 your vow of chastity.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.210
You'd make a hell of a Republican.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.880
It is not necessary for you to walk me 
 to the plane.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.500
It's the least I can do. We're brothers.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.090
Have a nice flight.

17:00.170 --> 17:02.850
I have no idea why I am so nice to you.

17:02.970 --> 17:04.599
Look, you got me here.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.720
Are you satisfied? Now go.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.099
Come on. Don't give me that sad-ass, 
 puppy dog look.

17:11.180 --> 17:14.650
I'm not. I'm giving you the grateful, 
 deeply moved, Italian-American...

17:14.730 --> 17:17.490
...religiously-inspired look. 
 There's a difference.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.400
Why?

17:18.480 --> 17:22.240
Even though you won't admit it, 
 we both know you made the right decision.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.000
I'm only taking this job 
 to make your life miserable.

17:25.069 --> 17:26.630
-Is that right? 
 -Yes.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.160
This is where I get back at you.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.750
Speaking of which...

17:30.910 --> 17:32.500
...have I got a surprise for you.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.960
No. No surprises. What is it?

17:35.170 --> 17:36.250
Lips are sealed.

17:36.330 --> 17:39.260
-Your lips could be busted. What is it? 
 -Listen to this.

17:39.340 --> 17:43.640
When you get to Los Angeles call me, 
 because I want to hear all about it.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.550
Hey, are you listening to me?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.190
Have a pleasant trip.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.260
Sly, you don't understand....

17:51.560 --> 17:53.600
Have a nice flight, Mr. Cutter.

18:49.870 --> 18:51.530
FBI. Thank you.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.090
Mr. Forget?

19:10.180 --> 19:12.100
"Forget." It's French.

19:12.430 --> 19:16.230
<i>Monsieur</i> Forget, you'll be in seat 5-C. 
 That's the aisle seat.

19:16.390 --> 19:17.980
On the left. Thanks.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.530
Norman, it is not polite to stare.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.260
May I take your coat, sir? Thank you.

19:56.430 --> 20:00.490
Any truth to the rumor that men in L.A. 
 actually talk without cue cards?

20:00.650 --> 20:04.150
They talk a lot, but whether or not 
 they say anything is another matter.

20:04.230 --> 20:07.240
- I take it this is your first trip to L.A.? 
 -It is.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.610
I'm Sabrina Ritchie. How do you do?

20:10.110 --> 20:12.880
Marti Slayton. Sabrina, 
 what a beautiful name.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.960
It is a thing most wondrous 
 to be flattered by one of your peers.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.000
I love the accent, too.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.410
Between us, I've been trying to lose it 
 for years.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.750
It makes me sound cold and heartless.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.840
Now that you mention it....

20:26.510 --> 20:29.010
Always trust your first impression.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.880
I have a feeling this'll be 
 a very interesting flight.

20:31.970 --> 20:33.640
I certainly hope so.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.640
You taken the head count yet?

20:37.140 --> 20:40.270
My fingers are beginning to point 
 as we speak.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.350
Champagne, madam?

21:06.460 --> 21:09.420
Behave yourself. You won't get any toys 
 in prison.

21:09.510 --> 21:14.340
I never had any toys. My father believed 
 they would warp my sense of values.

21:14.510 --> 21:16.510
Is your father still alive?

21:17.680 --> 21:18.850
Died...

21:19.020 --> 21:20.520
...violently.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.520
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight....

21:30.240 --> 21:31.990
54, 55, 56, 57....

21:36.160 --> 21:37.540
58, 59....

21:49.880 --> 21:53.340
-Can I get you anything? 
 -Nothing right now, thanks.

21:56.220 --> 21:59.100
Looks like I just found my next ex-wife.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.690
Make sure all carry-on items are secured 
 beneath your seats...

22:10.780 --> 22:13.620
...or properly stored 
 in an overhead compartment.

22:15.110 --> 22:19.080
I'm Marti. If I can do anything 
 to make your trip more comfortable...

22:19.280 --> 22:22.130
...please feel free to ask for my assistance.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.340
Who needs assistance this early?

22:31.590 --> 22:32.710
John Cutter.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.220
He's a security specialist for the airlines.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.630
Security?

22:37.260 --> 22:39.100
I feel safe already.

23:44.700 --> 23:45.870
Menu, sir?

23:49.170 --> 23:50.550
Menu, sir?

23:51.710 --> 23:53.510
Pardon me, Stewardess?

23:55.550 --> 23:58.480
Is that man with the handcuffs dangerous?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.310
There's nothing to worry about.

24:01.390 --> 24:03.930
Right now, he's as safe 
 as this handsome little boy.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.850
-What's your name? 
 -Norman.

24:06.020 --> 24:09.060
If he tries to do something bad, 
 I'll shoot him.

24:09.190 --> 24:10.910
What if he shoots back?

24:11.020 --> 24:15.490
I also have a secret decoder ring 
 that protects me from bullets and spiders...

24:15.650 --> 24:17.150
...but I left it at home.

24:17.240 --> 24:20.200
Don't worry, I've got mine 
 and I'll save all of us.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.950
Give me a smile, I might get you a soda. 
 If that's all right with your mom.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.590
-Sure. 
 -Orange?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.290
You got it.

24:27.910 --> 24:29.000
Thank you.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.560
Excuse me, Stewardess, 
 I've had the light on for a while.

24:38.630 --> 24:42.180
Flight attendant. If you go to your seat, 
 I'll bring you your peanuts.

24:42.260 --> 24:44.350
All I want is an aspirin.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.430
Here you go.

24:48.310 --> 24:49.690
Hey, look...

24:50.440 --> 24:54.360
...maybe I was a little hard on you in class 
 but that was for your own good.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.610
Is this the way you apologize?

24:57.030 --> 24:59.030
This is gonna be a long flight.

24:59.110 --> 25:00.690
You've got that right.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.860
Excuse me. Excuse me.

25:05.450 --> 25:07.620
Maybe you can just do me a favor?

25:07.700 --> 25:09.040
This ought to be good.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.800
I'm not all that comfortable on planes.

25:11.870 --> 25:14.420
There are extra pillows 
 in the overhead compartment.

25:14.500 --> 25:18.460
When anything moves faster than 
 I can walk, I'd rather be behind the wheel.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.130
Who'd have guessed you're a control freak?

25:21.220 --> 25:25.050
-You won't make this easy, will you? 
 -How can I make your trip more pleasant?

25:25.140 --> 25:29.100
I just want you to check on me 
 from time to time. That's it.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.230
Take your seat and I'll see what I can do.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.150
Champagne with your dinners?

25:41.240 --> 25:45.740
Not on duty, but I'll have some 
 tomato juice and I'll have the chicken.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.990
How appropriate.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.910
I'll have the steak.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.010
Keep the champagne on ice. 
We'll celebrate later.

25:59.590 --> 26:03.340
Sir, this is Mrs. Edwards. 
She's a frequent air traveler.

26:04.260 --> 26:08.680
When I told her about you, she said 
she'd help you feel more comfortable.

26:08.930 --> 26:11.180
It's a real honor to meet you.

26:12.350 --> 26:15.520
I take this flight once a month. 
I have grandchildren in Van Nuys.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.110
That's just outside of Los Angeles.

26:18.190 --> 26:21.440
Maybe not just outside, but hell, 
 Los Angeles is so spread out...

26:21.530 --> 26:25.950
...who's to know where it begins and ends, 
 what's inside and outside.

26:27.030 --> 26:30.530
Wait till I tell everyone 
I sat next to you on the plane.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.790
I watch your show all the time.

26:32.870 --> 26:34.910
-My show? 
 Never miss it.

26:37.630 --> 26:42.420
And I love it when you do those jokes 
 about, "Things that make you go 'hmmm."'

26:50.220 --> 26:53.390
-Robert. 
 -<i>I need a special service in first class.</i>

26:53.890 --> 26:55.480
I'll send it right up.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.750
I just loved it when you told off Madonna.

27:12.830 --> 27:15.840
Who is she to tell you how 
 to wear your hair?

27:16.750 --> 27:19.590
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

27:19.670 --> 27:22.170
I'll probably be in there a long time.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.170
Oh, I'm that way, too.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.430
I don't need this.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.430
I don't need this at all.

27:37.270 --> 27:39.020
Do you know the time?

27:39.190 --> 27:41.950
Why? You got someplace you got to go?

27:51.620 --> 27:53.780
How do you like your sirloin, sir?

27:53.990 --> 27:55.240
Bloody.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.300
Everybody, sit down! 
 Be quiet and you won't get hurt!

28:19.310 --> 28:20.560
Who's in charge?

28:20.650 --> 28:21.520
I am.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.820
Once again. Who's in charge?

28:25.070 --> 28:26.150
You are.

28:26.230 --> 28:27.360
Excellent.

28:27.690 --> 28:30.710
Quiet! Quiet! Sit your ass down! 
 Sit down!

28:32.410 --> 28:34.040
What the hell is that?

28:36.660 --> 28:39.670
Sit down, shut up or be killed! 
 Your choice.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.210
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:41.290 --> 28:44.790
<i>...I'm afraid your in-flight</i> 
 <i>entertainment program has been canceled.</i>

28:44.880 --> 28:47.590
<i>The weapons being carried</i> 
 <i>by my staff are real.</i>

28:47.710 --> 28:49.270
So is their desire to use them...

28:49.340 --> 28:50.590
<i>...if provoked.</i>

28:50.680 --> 28:54.550
I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary 
 in order to achieve my goal.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.680
<i>If you do as instructed,</i> 
 <i>you will not be harmed.</i>

28:57.890 --> 29:00.650
<i>If you disobey or interfere</i> 
 <i>with their activities...</i>

29:00.730 --> 29:02.560
...you will be shot.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.650
Oh, man.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.130
All right, all right.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.630
This is your idea of a surprise?

29:26.630 --> 29:29.260
Very funny, Sly. You better be there.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.460
No, no, no. This can't be happening. 
 Not now.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.250
First this Arsenio shit, then this.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.020
Come on, come on.

30:16.300 --> 30:19.720
Hello. I got an emergency. 
 My name is John Cutter.

30:24.140 --> 30:26.060
I need Sly Delvecchio.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.770
I don't know how to spell his name. 
 D-E-L-vecchio.

30:30.320 --> 30:34.200
-Gary's compiled those numbers and-- 
 -There's a call for you.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.400
Excuse me.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.340
-Who is it? 
 -John Cutter.

30:39.410 --> 30:40.620
Great.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.160
Shit.

30:45.290 --> 30:46.290
Cutter?

30:48.960 --> 30:50.880
You! Back to your seat.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.760
Please don't shoot me! I don't want to die!

30:53.840 --> 30:55.970
I said, back to your seat!

30:56.760 --> 30:59.050
They've taken over the plane!

31:00.680 --> 31:03.690
Get everybody up here 
 for an emergency meeting, now!

31:03.810 --> 31:05.810
They've taken over the plane!

31:21.830 --> 31:23.660
How many? How many?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.330
Let's say hello to your friends.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.010
All right, freeze!

31:30.090 --> 31:31.960
Drop the fucking gun, or your friend dies.

31:32.050 --> 31:33.510
I have no friends.

31:34.050 --> 31:36.760
His name's John Cutter. 
 He's airline security.

31:36.840 --> 31:40.930
I'm sure your superiors would not like you 
 to do anything rash...

31:41.010 --> 31:44.430
...and risk the lives 
 of all these wonderful people.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.180
Stand up! Move!

31:52.860 --> 31:56.780
Airline personnel assume a certain risk. 
 It's part of the job.

31:57.030 --> 31:58.700
But these passengers...

31:58.780 --> 32:00.280
...they're so innocent.

32:00.370 --> 32:01.780
What do you want?

32:02.530 --> 32:07.010
I have what I want. I have control 
 of the plane and everything on it.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.670
Must I prove that to you?

32:11.290 --> 32:12.500
Sir...

32:13.090 --> 32:15.380
...tell Mr. Cutter your name.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.590
Douglas.

32:18.090 --> 32:19.680
Cutter, meet Douglas.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.050
Let him go.

32:21.220 --> 32:23.760
Do you have any children, Douglas?

32:24.220 --> 32:25.610
A daughter.

32:26.730 --> 32:28.230
A family man.

32:28.810 --> 32:30.900
He has a daughter who loves him.

32:31.190 --> 32:34.360
And she, until your interference, 
 had a father.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.630
Drop the fucking gun.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.670
I loathe incompetence.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.630
Elevator!

33:16.360 --> 33:18.440
Who are you? What're you doing?

33:18.610 --> 33:20.250
There's always someone here.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.950
I just get paid to send food upstairs. 
 Give me a break.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.120
All right. Look, we got a hijack situation 
 upstairs, okay?

33:28.580 --> 33:30.830
I need your help. Anything.

33:32.670 --> 33:36.800
I'm not risking my life. 
 You'll have to fight terrorists on your own.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.380
Give me a knife or a screwdriver.

33:45.010 --> 33:48.140
I think we should do exactly 
 what Mr. Rane wants.

34:06.700 --> 34:07.740
Come on!

34:17.500 --> 34:18.920
You got to go.

34:23.929 --> 34:27.219
See if you can find something 
 to tie him up with.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.889
Notify the Feds and alert Radar. 
 Don't let the plane out of our sight!

34:31.980 --> 34:34.650
Let me know the minute 
 you contact the pilot.

34:34.730 --> 34:37.100
Notify ATC about our situation.

34:37.190 --> 34:41.940
I want a complete passenger list. 
 I want it five minutes ago! Get to work!

35:03.340 --> 35:06.220
-So what's the plan? 
 -Make it to the avionics compartment.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.470
Once there I can override the controls 
 and bring the plane down.

35:09.550 --> 35:11.720
What? This is a jumbo jet!

35:11.850 --> 35:14.560
I know, but we don't have any choice.

35:18.730 --> 35:21.440
Correct me if I'm wrong, 
 but wasn't it you who said...

35:21.530 --> 35:23.570
...to do exactly as the terrorists tell you?

35:23.650 --> 35:25.120
He's not just a terrorist.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.530
-How you gonna bring the plane down? 
 -I'll empty the fuel.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.660
Are you out of your mind? 
 We could all crash!

35:32.740 --> 35:34.790
-Exactly. 
 -No! I won't let you do this!

35:34.870 --> 35:37.290
It's too dangerous! You're certifiable!

35:37.370 --> 35:39.670
Damn it, Lisa! I don't have time 
 for this shit!

35:39.750 --> 35:42.960
That man is one of the most dangerous 
 terrorists in the world.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.460
He has killed two people.

35:44.550 --> 35:49.180
He will kill everybody else on this 
 fucking plane if I don't bring him down.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.600
Look, I need your help.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.470
Please.

35:55.850 --> 35:57.730
Tell me you're good at this.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.780
I'm the best.

36:02.610 --> 36:04.020
Then do it.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.830
Charles Rane, the sophisticated 
 British aristocrat...

36:16.910 --> 36:19.210
...known internationally 
 as "The Rane of Terror."

36:19.290 --> 36:21.630
He's linked to bombings 
 in London and Ireland...

36:21.710 --> 36:25.050
...but because of his ties 
 to the Middle East, he's been untouchable.

36:25.130 --> 36:28.840
Judging from the fact he killed his father, 
 he was a sick kid, too.

36:28.930 --> 36:30.590
What his old man did to him...

36:30.680 --> 36:34.260
...didn't exactly qualify him 
 for "father of the year" honors.

36:34.810 --> 36:37.520
You let the Feds put a terrorist 
 on one of my planes?

36:37.600 --> 36:40.700
-They didn't notify me. Here's his file. 
 -They can do that?

36:40.770 --> 36:43.870
The FBI shows up at the last minute, 
 takes what seats they need....

36:43.940 --> 36:46.070
They don't have to notify us. 
 They're the FBI!

36:46.150 --> 36:50.540
Jesus Christ. You'd think they'd put 
 an airline hijacker on a bus or a train.

36:50.610 --> 36:53.030
Why were they taking him to Los Angeles?

36:53.120 --> 36:56.870
He was supposed to stand trial 
 for the Trans Pacific bombing last year.

36:56.950 --> 36:58.950
Guess he had different plans.

36:59.330 --> 37:01.000
He will have to change them again.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.000
Why is that?

37:02.080 --> 37:03.720
Cutter is on that plane.

37:24.360 --> 37:25.770
What's the problem?

37:25.860 --> 37:29.360
We're losing fuel. One way or another, 
 we're going down.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.540
Then you'd better make preparations 
 to land.

37:34.490 --> 37:36.410
Why are we going back there?

37:36.490 --> 37:39.290
-It's easier to jump off from the rear. 
 -What?

37:39.450 --> 37:42.300
It's easier to jump off the plane 
 from the rear.

37:49.010 --> 37:51.630
The plane's losing altitude. 
 I think they're preparing to land.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.760
-Where is it? 
 -Outside Lake Lucille, Louisiana.

37:54.930 --> 37:59.150
The airfield there may not be large enough, 
 but it may be their only choice.

37:59.850 --> 38:03.060
-How fast can we get a chopper there? 
 -A chopper? Why?

38:03.190 --> 38:04.820
I want you there as quickly as possible.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.730
You mean on a helicopter?

38:06.820 --> 38:10.070
I don't want the FBI or some country local 
 talking to the press...

38:10.150 --> 38:12.110
...about what's affecting this airline.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.360
Get out there and keep me informed.

38:25.790 --> 38:29.460
<i>Atlantic International Flight 163.</i> 
 <i>We're declaring an emergency.</i>

38:29.550 --> 38:31.960
Request immediate authorization to land.

38:32.050 --> 38:36.190
Negative, 163. We're not a commercial 
 airport. Suggest you re-route.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.140
Suggestion refused.

38:38.510 --> 38:42.390
Repeat, 163. We're not equipped 
 to handle an aircraft your size.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.020
-It's too dangerous-- 
 -<i>Shut up and listen.</i>

38:45.230 --> 38:49.110
It is too dangerous for you. 
 See that the runway is cleared.

38:50.690 --> 38:53.490
Call Atlantic International. 
 See what the hell is going on.

38:53.570 --> 38:55.860
Call the hospital, too, just in case.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.020
Who's Lisa?

39:19.390 --> 39:20.390
What?

39:20.560 --> 39:23.680
Lisa. You called me Lisa 
 in the avionics compartment.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.650
She was my wife.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.110
"Was?"

39:31.110 --> 39:33.900
She was with me when I tried 
 to stop a robbery.

39:34.990 --> 39:36.280
I lived.

39:39.740 --> 39:41.130
I'm sorry.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.170
Plan not working out...

39:54.260 --> 39:56.090
<i>...the way you wanted, asshole?</i>

39:56.170 --> 39:59.140
Don't flatter yourself. 
 You prevented nothing.

39:59.510 --> 40:02.140
Although it seems 
 I may have underestimated you.

40:02.220 --> 40:04.600
<i>Dumping the fuel was quite ingenious.</i>

40:04.980 --> 40:08.520
<i>At least Mr. Douglas's body</i> 
 <i>won't have so far to fall then.</i>

40:09.480 --> 40:12.820
Maybe Vincent could hitch a ride with him 
 on his way down.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.190
You know, Charlie, 
 I'm a little surprised at you.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.070
Didn't your father teach you never 
 to send a boy to do a man's job?

40:19.990 --> 40:21.460
Speaking of boys...

40:21.870 --> 40:25.620
...our stewardess friend must be feeling 
 particularly unsatisfied.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.160
Charlie, you ever play roulette?

40:28.330 --> 40:29.580
On occasion.

40:29.670 --> 40:31.830
<i>Let me give you a word of advice:</i>

40:33.250 --> 40:34.810
Always bet on black.

40:40.470 --> 40:42.470
<i>Mr. Delvecchio, are you okay?</i>

40:42.640 --> 40:44.970
Could you please close the door?

40:45.310 --> 40:46.810
The door is closed.

40:46.890 --> 40:50.810
Do you want us to fly higher? 
 It might be a little smoother up there.

40:53.110 --> 40:54.580
This is fine.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.480
This is fine.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.510
You better buckle up. 
 The landing's gonna be rough.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.820
Let me give you a hand.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.750
Biggest damn Cessna I ever saw!

41:52.040 --> 41:54.800
Get somebody out to the runway. 
 I'll be in the tower.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.040
Patrick, just do something.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.390
<i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>

42:02.470 --> 42:04.760
<i>Brace yourselves for a short-field landing.</i>

42:04.850 --> 42:08.850
<i>Flight attendants, take your positions</i> 
 <i>for an emergency landing.</i>

42:44.800 --> 42:48.760
All Right, Listen up, The tower's going to 
 need as much assistance as they can get.

42:49.430 --> 42:53.310
You communicate with the airline staff, I 
 will coordinate rescue activities on the ground.

42:53.390 --> 42:55.310
How do we get down there?

42:55.400 --> 42:58.070
We step out. Gravity'll do the rest.

43:02.070 --> 43:03.990
As soon as it stops, we jump.

43:31.930 --> 43:34.780
<i>Mr. Delvecchio,</i> 
 <i>I've got Mr. Ramsey on the line.</i>

43:36.230 --> 43:39.320
I guess we can't tell him I stepped out, 
 now, can we?

43:40.110 --> 43:41.770
Put him through.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.030
<i>I just had an idea about how to use Cutter.</i>

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
"Use?"

43:48.240 --> 43:50.830
If this works out you're to tell the press...

43:50.910 --> 43:54.910
...we had a security agent on the plane 
 as part of our anti-terrorist plan.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.010
If it doesn't work out, 
 don't tell them about Cutter.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.080
I'll handle that. Understand?

44:00.670 --> 44:02.140
<i>Do you understand?</i>

44:02.880 --> 44:04.050
Yes, sir.

44:04.550 --> 44:05.880
Yes, sir.

44:13.810 --> 44:16.350
I had such wonderful plans for us.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.730
If she disobeys, kill her.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.190
Let me go!

44:30.820 --> 44:33.240
On the ground! Face down! Do it, now!

44:33.450 --> 44:34.920
I'm security for the airlines.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.580
Yeah, and I'm governor of Louisiana! 
 Get your ass on the ground.

44:39.670 --> 44:41.920
I'm already on the ground, asshole.

44:48.180 --> 44:49.730
You're making a mistake.

44:49.800 --> 44:54.020
I'm John Cutter. I'm airline security. 
 The plane's been hijacked.

44:59.270 --> 45:00.990
-Get the door. 
 -Damn it!

45:01.060 --> 45:05.200
The people on the plane are hostages. 
 There are hostages on the plane!

45:07.780 --> 45:10.710
This is Chief Leonard Biggs, 
 Lake Lucille Police Department.

45:10.780 --> 45:13.070
Tell me what you want, 
 I'll tell you what I can do.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.240
<i>I want this plane fully fueled.</i>

45:15.410 --> 45:19.250
If I do not see a fuel truck in position 
 in the next five minutes...

45:19.330 --> 45:22.210
...you'll be responsible 
 for a great many deaths.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.430
I'm not fully authorized 
 to grant any demands at this time.

45:25.500 --> 45:30.130
Look out your window toward the plane, 
 just in front of the landing gear.

45:38.480 --> 45:42.980
I've just executed five passengers. 
 I'll execute five more every three minutes...

45:43.060 --> 45:46.570
...until you find me someone authorized 
 to meet my demands.

45:47.530 --> 45:49.530
Look, I want to help...

45:50.240 --> 45:53.740
...but how do I know you won't kill 
 the passengers anyway?

45:53.950 --> 45:55.450
Get the truck near the plane.

45:55.530 --> 45:59.540
As soon as the fuel begins to flow, 
 I'll release half of the passengers.

45:59.700 --> 46:03.670
You will be responsible 
 for saving 100 lives all by yourself.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.600
I'll make some calls.

46:06.670 --> 46:09.350
While you're on the phone, 
 I'll be killing more passengers.

46:09.420 --> 46:10.810
Let me know when I should stop.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.550
Now, wait, wait!

46:13.590 --> 46:15.470
<i>Do we have an agreement?</i>

46:18.270 --> 46:19.730
Fuel is on its way.

46:21.230 --> 46:22.810
Check and mate.

46:23.980 --> 46:25.780
Shouldn't we wait for the FBI?

46:25.860 --> 46:28.780
Hell, no. I'm in charge until they get here.

46:28.980 --> 46:32.080
You heard that man. I just saved 100 lives.

46:32.400 --> 46:36.240
Let them damn federal boys see 
 if they can do better than that.

46:42.290 --> 46:44.040
-Mr. Ramsey? 
 -Yeah?

46:45.290 --> 46:48.420
Just got this on Rane. 
 You're not going to like it.

46:49.630 --> 46:51.710
Two years ago, 
 Interpol thought they had him.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.260
Remember the bombings in London, 
 the three train stations?

46:55.840 --> 46:58.640
Rane did it. He killed over 60 people.

46:59.890 --> 47:02.020
Just to create a distraction.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.680
"Distraction?"

47:03.770 --> 47:07.440
This guy's got a habit of blowing things up 
 just to cover his escape.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.110
We've got over 200 passengers 
 on that plane.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.940
What do you think he wants?

47:12.030 --> 47:14.320
Obvious, isn't it? 
 The guy is facing the chair.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.120
He'll do whatever it takes to escape.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.700
I wouldn't be surprised 
 if he blew up the plane...

47:18.780 --> 47:21.410
...and then just disappeared in the flames.

47:40.970 --> 47:43.730
Shut up! Would you get him? He's strong.

47:43.850 --> 47:45.980
-There's four of them on the plane. 
 -Shut up!

47:46.060 --> 47:48.740
We caught him by the plane. 
 He tried to attack us.

47:48.810 --> 47:51.610
If I had tried to attack, 
 I wouldn't be the one bleeding.

47:51.690 --> 47:54.240
What were you doing out on that airfield?

47:54.320 --> 47:58.240
My name is John Cutter. I'm head 
 of security for Atlantic International.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.490
I was a passenger on the plane 
 before it was hijacked.

48:00.580 --> 48:03.340
Head of security. Ain't that a pickle?

48:03.580 --> 48:06.370
You won't mind me saying Mr. Cutter, 
 you ain't done too good a job.

48:06.540 --> 48:08.120
What is that fuel tank doing out there?

48:08.210 --> 48:10.500
I'm negotiating the release 
 of 100 passengers.

48:10.590 --> 48:12.300
No! You can't trust him!

48:12.420 --> 48:16.340
They're more valuable to him on the plane. 
 He won't let them off.

48:16.430 --> 48:17.630
He needs fuel.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.190
He wouldn't trade the hostages!

48:19.260 --> 48:22.110
Don't you worry your ass 
 about what he needs!

48:22.390 --> 48:24.110
He wants to talk to you.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.480
This is Chief Biggs. 
 The fuel is on its way like I promised.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.330
<i>I, in turn, shall fulfill my end of the bargain.</i>

48:33.400 --> 48:37.320
Chief, one of my men betrayed me 
 and escaped from the plane.

48:38.410 --> 48:39.870
Is that a fact?

48:39.950 --> 48:42.490
<i>A black man. Very smooth and convincing.</i>

48:42.620 --> 48:45.790
I would prefer to deal with him directly 
 for his cowardice...

48:45.870 --> 48:49.420
...but should you find it necessary 
 to inflict harm upon him...

48:49.500 --> 48:51.750
... I will not hold you liable.

48:56.260 --> 48:58.510
The man in the plane says you're one 
 of his.

48:58.590 --> 49:02.680
People say they saw Elvis in a mall. 
 You gonna believe that shit, too?

49:02.760 --> 49:04.350
Look, he's a murderer!

49:04.640 --> 49:06.680
Let me see some identification.

49:10.810 --> 49:13.980
Doesn't say head of security. 
 Says you're an instructor.

49:14.070 --> 49:17.190
I'm former head of security 
 for Atlantic International.

49:17.860 --> 49:21.360
Put yourself in my place. 
 What would you do if you were me?

49:22.870 --> 49:24.340
Kill myself.

49:36.800 --> 49:41.130
Wait one hour before resuming the flight. 
 That'll give me sufficient time to escape.

49:41.220 --> 49:44.010
Once the plane is back up, 
 proceed with the original plan.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.300
Let me go with you.

49:45.390 --> 49:48.320
I need you to stay here 
 and carry out my instructions.

49:48.390 --> 49:52.900
-What if they deny us clearance? 
 -Start killing passengers until they do.

50:33.980 --> 50:35.360
Go on, move it!

50:35.610 --> 50:37.940
Get going, don't stop! Come on!

50:44.280 --> 50:48.670
What the hell is wrong with those people? 
 They'll trample each other to death!

50:58.300 --> 51:00.920
It's a trick! You gotta listen to me.

51:01.300 --> 51:03.880
I've had just about all the advice 
 from you I'll take.

51:03.970 --> 51:05.630
Haul his ass downstairs.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.760
If he gets cute, shoot him!

51:08.640 --> 51:09.890
In the leg.

51:10.060 --> 51:12.060
He might be telling the truth.

51:13.140 --> 51:16.190
Do me a favor, honey. 
 Fix me a cup of that special coffee.

51:16.270 --> 51:18.150
Maybe a couple of Bufferin.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.200
Dammit, you're making a mistake!

51:20.280 --> 51:23.400
Shut up, boy! You ain't said shit 
 I want to hear!

51:47.840 --> 51:49.140
Hold it!

52:16.670 --> 52:18.470
Chief, prisoner got away.

52:18.540 --> 52:19.540
No shit.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.250
Call for backup. I want somebody 
 from every sheriff's office around.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.880
He's headed toward the fairground. 
 Want us to go?

52:25.970 --> 52:29.140
Why? So he can get more practice 
 whipping your dumb ass?

52:29.220 --> 52:33.720
Take some men, and keep your damn guns 
 holstered, unless you have no choice.

52:34.180 --> 52:35.140
Go!

52:40.560 --> 52:42.310
Come on! Come on!

52:47.900 --> 52:51.990
That won't be necessary, Vincent. 
 I'll take care of Mr. Cutter.

52:54.750 --> 52:56.210
Secure transportation.

52:56.290 --> 52:59.920
Meet us at the other side 
 of the fairground in ten minutes.

53:16.890 --> 53:21.030
-Chief Biggs? Dwight Henderson, FBI. 
 -Leonard Biggs, Lake Lucille Police.

53:21.100 --> 53:24.440
I need a concise report on the status 
 of this operation.

53:24.610 --> 53:26.110
Make yourself comfortable.

53:26.190 --> 53:30.530
That airplane and my blood pressure 
 ain't going a damn bit higher than it is.

54:57.530 --> 54:58.530
Damn!

55:05.000 --> 55:06.800
<i>Flight 163, do you read me?</i>

55:07.040 --> 55:09.300
Flight 163, come in, please.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.920
Flight 163, do you read me?

55:12.010 --> 55:15.430
Save your breath. They ain't gonna answer 
 you till they're darn ready.

55:15.510 --> 55:19.510
All we can do is sit and wait to hear 
 from them or our men in the field.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.680
Just hope that Cutter fella 
 was telling the truth.

55:23.390 --> 55:25.350
-John Cutter? 
 -You know him?

55:25.520 --> 55:26.940
What happened to him?

55:27.020 --> 55:28.940
He said he was on that plane.

55:29.020 --> 55:32.320
Beat up my men, headed towards 
 the fairgrounds. We'll catch him.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.250
I hope you got a good 
 early-retirement plan.

55:36.030 --> 55:39.530
Take Dean, Peale and Christopher. 
 Get over to the fairgrounds.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.580
You better see to it 
 your men don't harm Cutter.

55:42.660 --> 55:46.330
Because if he's hurt, I'll press charges 
 against you myself.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.200
Move!

58:54.600 --> 58:56.110
Freeze! Don't move!

58:56.230 --> 58:58.360
FBI! You're under arrest!

58:59.860 --> 59:01.190
Let him go!

59:07.700 --> 59:12.500
There's another one. Five feet 10 inches, 
 he's got a tan jacket and blue, navy pants.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.290
Check around.

59:57.540 --> 59:59.130
Watch yourself!

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:03.920
Get him out.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.480
Dwight Henderson, FBI.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.850
-Heard a great deal about you. 
 -Pleasure's mutual.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:12.180
-You all right, man? 
 -I'm fine.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.810
What is wrong with you? 
 That's your idea of a surprise?

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.060
You fucking put me on a plane 
 with a terrorist?

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:20.160
Relax, nobody knew. 
 The FBI didn't notify us!

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:25.240
Those two agents you murdered 
 on the plane were friends of mine.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.120
Thanks for telling me. I do enjoy knowing 
 the people whose lives I've touched.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.660
That's enough! You're gonna help us 
 or I'll rip your goddamn throat out!

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:34.700
Come on.

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.120
While you're considering organ donations...

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:41.680
...it might be wise to spare some thought 
 for the passengers on board.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.470
If I'm not released, you'll be clearing up 
 their remains for quite some time.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.380
What are you talking about, asshole?

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:52.890
My colleagues have instructions 
 to start killing passengers in 20 minutes.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:56.390
Get this piece of shit inside.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.900
I'll station some of my men 
 behind the plane with tear gas and masks.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.910
Two agents will escort Rane 
 up the boarding stairs.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.900
You're just gonna let him back 
 on the plane?

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:11.240
-So he'll think. 
 -How are your sharpshooters?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.580
-The best. 
 -They won't get a second chance.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.080
They won't need it.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.660
Sharpshooters?

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.750
What about Rane's people that are still 
 on the airplane?

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.590
Just be patient.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.130
I'm the only one who knows who they are. 
 I can be wired.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.840
I can signal to Henderson's men 
 when it's safe to shoot.

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:34.010
We take out Rane first. 
 Then will you have time for the tear gas?

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.110
My men'll go up the stairs 
 when the first shots are fired.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.770
We'll already have the door secured.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.610
This sounds too crazy, John. It's....

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.690
Too much can go wrong.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.830
Goddamn it, Sly! Listen!

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:49.950
I saw him take a passenger on that plane. 
 He asked about his family...

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:53.370
...then blew his brains out 
 all over the goddamn floor.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.620
The longer we wait, 
 the more people will be sacrificed.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.370
Fine.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.680
All right. I'll go tell Rane. 
 I'll make it look like he negotiated it.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.090
No.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.640
Let me tell him.

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:12.050
Alone.

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:17.930
Sure.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.610
John?

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:26.820
You okay?

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.490
I'm all right.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:15.200
Mr. Cutter, how kind of you 
 to pay me a visit.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.240
You've been a worthy adversary.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.120
It's a shame we won't be seeing 
 much more of each other.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.920
Let me tell you something.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.420
If anybody else gets hurt on that plane...

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.560
...it'll take more than a prison cell 
 to keep me from ripping your nuts off!

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.840
I'd come to expect more from you 
 than cheap vulgarities.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.510
You and I both know I will never see 
 the inside of a prison.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.100
The notion of good over evil 
 will not allow you to sit idly by...

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.350
...and watch the needless death 
 of your fellow citizens.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.820
You know, you got a good point. 
 Maybe I should just kill you right here.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.190
You wouldn't take advantage 
 of a helpless man, would you?

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.070
It's never stopped you.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.030
That's the American way, isn't it...

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.240
...brother?

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:02.040
You should know. 
 You're used to being taken advantage of.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.010
I want them off the plane.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.830
We share the same hunger. 
 We're both killers. I know the breed.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.020
I'm sick of your shit!

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:16.970
You need the passengers. 
 I want the plane.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.810
Put me back on board 
 and the passengers will be released.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.680
-Right. I'm supposed to trust you? 
 -Trust your instincts.

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.530
My instincts are to wax your ass 
 all over this floor.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.230
Those are your emotions acting 
 without the benefit of intellect.

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.150
The passengers' lives are in your hands.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.400
Don't fail them.

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:39.700
Sit down!

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.590
Why are you keeping us here?

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.760
What do you want? 
 For God's sake, let us go!

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:03.390
It's all right.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.180
Don't give him a reason to hurt you. 
 That's exactly what they want.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.100
Just try and remain calm.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.350
There we go.

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.940
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.240
All right?

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.540
<i>Flight 163, this is Daddy.</i>

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.200
I will be rejoining you shortly.

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.750
If I'm not safely on board 
 within five minutes...

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:33.880
...you are to continue 
 as previously instructed.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.510
Gentlemen, I'm ready to leave 
 your lovely little town.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.720
This is Cutter. Everybody in position?

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:25.350
Target is well within range. 
 Awaiting your command.

01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:28.970
That's a 10-4. Nobody does anything 
 till I say, "go."

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.790
All right! All units stand by.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.970
Now! Take him!

01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:10.890
Take him!

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.130
-How is it? 
 -It's okay.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:38.090
-Okay, good. 
 -It's all right.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.930
Get this plane off the ground! Move!

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.460
Move around!

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.310
Biggs, drive!

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.640
-Where? 
 -Follow the fucking plane!

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.729
Go!

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:37.810
Go!

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:44.029
<i>I hope you enjoyed your stopover.</i>

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:47.200
<i>We'll now continue with the remainder</i> 
 <i>of the flight.</i>

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:51.240
If you don't want to wear your seat belts, 
 you don't have to.

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:54.590
What do we do when we catch it?

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.250
-You'll watch me sneak on the plane. 
 -What?

01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:01.210
I knew you were crazy the minute 
 I laid eyes on your ass.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:05.010
I thought all you biscuit-eating boys 
 knew how to drive!

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:06.920
Was that just bullshit?

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:09.760
I ain't had a challenge like that 
 since high school.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:12.180
I didn't know you went to high school.

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:14.560
This better be covered 
 by the health insurance.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.180
It's under the section on mental illness.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.569
Bring it close to the landing gear!

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:27.319
I need a gun!

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.359
You need your head examined!

01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:32.380
Keep this in good condition. It's my wife's.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.080
Bring your ass back alive, do you hear me?

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.180
Miss the opportunity to get back at you? 
 No way!

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:40.800
Let's do it!

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:57.350
I got a bad feeling about this. 
 I got a bad feeling about this one.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.350
Oh, man!

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.120
Flight Control, this is Lake Lucille. 
 We have a hijacked aircraft.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.080
I want every radar station 
 in the Southeast following the plane.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.840
They're on it already. 
 Do you read me, Approach Control?

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:29.220
Mr. Forget, it's time 
 to make the proper arrangements.

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:47.150
Your friend, Mr. Cutter, 
 has left you in a rather precarious position.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.030
Pour me a drink.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.820
What do you want?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.830
Anything wet.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:10.010
Did you enjoy yourself down there 
 in the lower galley?

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.550
You and your friend in that tight, 
 little place?

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.680
Tell me, Marti.

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:21.600
Did the hero get into your...

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:23.810
...tight, little place?

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.620
You're repulsive!

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.610
You'll change your mind 
 once we get to know each other.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.530
You'll have to kill me first.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.030
No, Marti...

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.410
...I'm going to kill you during.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.270
It's almost time. What the hell 
 is taking Forget so long?

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.600
Maybe he's having difficulty 
 finding the trunk.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.850
Idiot.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.870
Who're you?

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:49.120
Cutter. John Cutter.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.040
Chill out. I'm the good guy.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.040
-Where are they? 
 -In the back.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.800
Can you turn the plane around 
 and land at the airfield we just left?

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.130
I did it once.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.380
Do it again.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.640
You got it.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.900
Center, Atlantic International 163 with you.

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.740
Something's wrong. Check the flight crew.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.370
Why did you turn the plane?

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.660
We were told to head back.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.420
-By whom? 
 -By me.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.760
What a waste.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.220
Keep that on her. If she moves, 
 throw her out the window.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.890
Need help?

01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:47.220
No, there's only one left.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.930
He's all mine.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120
Open it.

01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:57.290
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.600
<i>Control Tower, this is John Cutter,</i> 
 <i>Line 163, do you read me?</i>

01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:41.360
Yes, what's your status?

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.740
Single at the moment...

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.530
...but I'm working on it.

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:49.540
Cutter, this is Henderson. 
 Have you disabled Rane?

01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:51.670
You're damn skippy.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.780
All right, Cutter!

01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:55.340
<i>Hey, Biggs...</i>

01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:57.460
...how you doing? Is this you?

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:59.120
In the flesh.

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:01.210
That's a revolting thought.

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.360
Hey, there. Have you seen John Cutter?

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.900
Last time I saw him, 
 he was with a flight attendant.

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.320
Okay, thanks.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.210
Tell Ramsey I'm taking a vacation.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.380
Done!

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:29.270
And I want a raise.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.760
Done.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.300
-Ready to go? 
 -Where do you want to go?

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:34.890
Any place but here.

01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:38.190
What about these reporters?

01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:40.390
What should I do about them?

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.560
John, this isn't my bag!

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.580
Are you a representative of the airline?

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:08.050
Yes, and I'm pleased to report 
 that our special anti-terrorist program...

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.130
...which was enacted 
 under my supervision...

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.260
...was an extraordinary success.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:14.980
What's your name?

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.680
Sly Delvecchio.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.570
You all riding or walking?

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.680
Walk!

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:25.600
Five miles to town.

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:27.610
No, thanks.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.610
Did you happen to see my wife's gun?

01:20:32.690 --> 01:20:34.080
Good night.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.830
Good night, Biggs.
