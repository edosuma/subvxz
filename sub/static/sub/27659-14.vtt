WEBVTT

00:05.668 --> 00:07.870
So you guys are gonna tie up
the only microwave

00:07.913 --> 00:10.220
for 20 minutes
to make a frozen lasagna?

00:10.264 --> 00:11.613
- Ballsy.
- You ignorant loser.

00:11.656 --> 00:14.442
First of all, it's not
just a frozen lasagna,

00:14.485 --> 00:16.008
it's a Mama Magglione's.

00:16.052 --> 00:18.924
Second of all, it's gonna
take 21 1/2 minutes.

00:18.968 --> 00:21.579
The box says 20, but we know
better than the box.

00:21.623 --> 00:23.755
You see, this microwave
is a KitchenPro Max.

00:23.799 --> 00:25.583
- Bit of a lightweight.
- It's only 1.2 kilowatts.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.281
- Fine for popcorn.
- But we're talking about

00:27.324 --> 00:28.412
a Mama Magglione's here.

00:28.456 --> 00:29.500
Takes a lot to get mama hot.

00:29.544 --> 00:31.154
She's a real size-queen.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.514
Well, that started out fun,

00:32.515 --> 00:34.897
and here we are at our normal
ending place: disgusting.

00:34.940 --> 00:35.941
Uh-oh.
Guys!

00:35.985 --> 00:37.639
We have a major problem here.

00:37.682 --> 00:40.685
- No garlic bread.
- Okay, we need to stay calm. Let's think.

00:40.729 --> 00:42.774
The garlic bread needs
to go in the toaster oven

00:42.775 --> 00:44.334
with eight minutes
left on the lasagna.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.721
Maybe we could run down to the
corner store and make it in time.

00:46.722 --> 00:49.024
That just gives us 12 minutes
to go to a place and come back.

00:49.025 --> 00:51.348
- Mama Magglione.
- We have to go now!

00:51.392 --> 00:54.177
Okay, well,
good luck with that, weirdos.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.570
Stupid piece of crap.

00:56.397 --> 00:57.746
Rosa, come on.

00:57.789 --> 00:59.313
You can't break a mouse in half.

00:59.356 --> 01:00.883
Oh, wow, you did.

01:00.884 --> 01:02.559
Scary. You really earn your rep.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.956
Stupid internet. The network's been
down all morning, and my girlfriend...

01:04.986 --> 01:06.916
- Jocelyn.
- Right. She's leaving town for two weeks.

01:07.021 --> 01:09.514
Oh, is Jocelyn leaving town?
Where is Jocelyn going?

01:09.515 --> 01:10.820
Dude, you forgot
her name one time.

01:10.864 --> 01:12.828
It's not a big deal. You don't have
to keep proving you remember it.

01:12.853 --> 01:14.389
That's not
what's happening here.

01:14.433 --> 01:15.564
I'm just saying it a lot,

01:15.608 --> 01:16.591
because she's
so important to me.

01:16.592 --> 01:17.680
- Okay, what's her last name?
- Uh-oh.

01:17.723 --> 01:19.044
- Mm-hmm. It's Pryce.
- Right.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.054
She's leaving town
for two weeks.

01:20.055 --> 01:21.593
I want to send flowers
to her hotel room.

01:21.594 --> 01:24.031
Aww, that's sweet.
I wish Amy would send me flowers.

01:24.075 --> 01:27.208
Why is it taking Holt and this I.T.
guy so long to fix the internet?

01:27.252 --> 01:29.167
One Police Plaza sent him
an hour ago.

01:30.255 --> 01:32.160
Huh.
Why does Holt look so worried?

01:32.161 --> 01:33.229
What are you talking about?

01:33.230 --> 01:34.666
He looks exactly
like he always does.

01:34.709 --> 01:37.774
To you, perhaps, but I finally
learned how to read his emotions.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.211
His lips are slightly pursed,

01:39.255 --> 01:40.897
and he's blinking at
eight-second intervals

01:40.898 --> 01:42.169
as opposed to his normal 10.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.389
Oh, my God.

01:43.432 --> 01:44.564
He's having a meltdown.

01:44.607 --> 01:45.826
"Meltdown" seems excessive.

01:45.869 --> 01:48.002
Yeah, it's a meltdown.
Mark my words.

01:48.045 --> 01:49.438
Hey, there, Captain.
Everything okay?

01:49.482 --> 01:50.570
No, I'm having a meltdown.

01:50.613 --> 01:51.561
Props. That was amazing.

01:51.562 --> 01:53.464
- Thanks. It was a lot of work.
- This is Sergeant Knox.

01:53.465 --> 01:54.304
From Cyber Operations.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.551
He's discovered the reason
for our network issues.

01:56.552 --> 01:58.423
A hacker is attempting
to break into our servers.

01:58.467 --> 01:59.978
Not all of them.
Just the LACMI server.

01:59.979 --> 02:01.918
- Well, that's good.
- No, Captain Holt's nostril

02:01.919 --> 02:03.668
- just twitched. It's bad.
- It's devastating.

02:03.668 --> 02:04.583
- Props again.
- Thanks, again.

02:04.584 --> 02:06.175
The LACMI server holds
clearance-protected

02:06.176 --> 02:08.895
information, including the
names of our undercover agents.

02:08.898 --> 02:10.987
If it's compromised, people
could lose their lives.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.641
Okay, but isn't
the server secure?

02:12.684 --> 02:14.686
Yes, but the hacker's
already used an ARP

02:14.730 --> 02:16.775
to resolve the host name
with the DNS server.

02:16.819 --> 02:19.038
Uh-huh. ARP. DNS. Totally
following what you're saying.

02:19.082 --> 02:20.692
Right now, they're trying
to get root access

02:20.736 --> 02:22.751
by connecting the OSI network
to the data-link.

02:22.752 --> 02:24.667
You know, I'm a bit
of a computer nerd myself,

02:24.711 --> 02:27.108
but could you, maybe dumb it
down a bit for my friends here?

02:27.109 --> 02:28.062
They're almost
through our defenses.

02:28.105 --> 02:30.717
If we can't stop them, they'll
be inside of our server in...

02:32.197 --> 02:34.199
19 minutes.

02:34.242 --> 02:36.853
Mama Magglione.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.269 --> 02:59.894
A countdown clock, green text
on a black background:

02:59.895 --> 03:01.765
we are in full-on
action-movie mode.

03:01.809 --> 03:04.084
Now all I need is my
no-nonsense captain to tell me

03:04.085 --> 03:06.056
to focus,
because time is running out.

03:06.057 --> 03:06.894
- Peralta.
- Yes?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.088
You have something in your teeth.
It's, uh, quite off-putting.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.394
What? No.
"Time is running out."

03:10.438 --> 03:11.961
I fed you your line.

03:12.005 --> 03:13.702
No one ever has something
in their teeth in a movie.

03:13.746 --> 03:15.356
Watch a movie, stupid Holt.
Damn it,

03:15.399 --> 03:16.879
I tried to remove
the server from the chain,

03:16.923 --> 03:18.054
but the hacker
blocked the protocol.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.201
Why don't you just unplug it?

03:19.201 --> 03:21.133
That's what I do any time
I'm having computer trouble.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.246
And also I code a lot.
Java, mainframe.

03:23.247 --> 03:24.126
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

03:24.127 --> 03:26.390
The NYPD servers have
internal backup batteries.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.522
Even if we unplug them, they'll
stay on for another two hours.

03:28.566 --> 03:30.350
As a captain, I have an
override code I can use

03:30.394 --> 03:32.614
to wipe the servers clean
so there'd be no information

03:32.657 --> 03:35.660
for the hackers to steal,
but there's one problem, Jake.

03:35.704 --> 03:37.096
- Yes, sir?
- You still have something

03:37.140 --> 03:38.620
in your teeth.
You tried to get rid of it,

03:38.663 --> 03:40.027
but it's made it
much more prominent.

03:40.029 --> 03:42.005
Why would you stop everything
just to tell me that?

03:42.006 --> 03:43.834
It's very distracting.
Anyway, I can't use

03:43.878 --> 03:46.010
my override code,
because doing so would delete

03:46.054 --> 03:48.012
the entire evidence
tracking database.

03:48.056 --> 03:50.188
The NYPD only backs up
that information

03:50.232 --> 03:51.842
at the precinct level
twice a year.

03:51.886 --> 03:53.812
We would lose four months
of evidence.

03:53.813 --> 03:55.641
So what you're saying
is that every perp

03:55.684 --> 03:57.251
awaiting trial would walk free?

03:57.294 --> 03:59.558
Exactly, and we have
hundreds of open cases.

03:59.601 --> 04:01.995
Wiping the servers
is not an option.

04:02.038 --> 04:04.536
The only solution
is to track down the hacker.

04:04.537 --> 04:06.146
How? It could be anywhere
in the world...

04:06.147 --> 04:08.192
Osaka, Berlin, Macau, Stockholm.

04:08.236 --> 04:09.670
Are you guys just gonna
keep letting me list cities

04:09.671 --> 04:11.586
- I've lived in?
- Wait, the LACMI server

04:11.629 --> 04:14.415
isn't wired to the internet.
It's supposed to be offline.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.807
How are they accessing it?

04:15.851 --> 04:17.444
They must be going
through a physical AP.

04:17.445 --> 04:20.142
Again, these guys don't get
computers like you and I,

04:20.187 --> 04:21.623
- So...
- It's not a remote connection.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.993
The hacker's inside the building.

04:24.558 --> 04:25.288
Let's mobilize.

04:25.289 --> 04:28.065
Nobody in or out of the
building without authorization.

04:28.066 --> 04:29.642
Check every inch of every floor.

04:30.391 --> 04:31.723
- And, Jake.
- Oh, let me guess.

04:31.724 --> 04:34.276
It's on another tooth now.
Is it somehow on my face?

04:34.277 --> 04:36.409
No, what I was
going to say is, we only have

04:36.453 --> 04:38.629
15 minutes left.
You need to focus,

04:38.673 --> 04:40.631
because time is running out.

04:40.675 --> 04:41.806
Oh, yeah.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.634
That's what the F
I'm talking about.

04:43.678 --> 04:44.983
Thank you, sir.

04:45.027 --> 04:46.858
What's all this?

04:46.859 --> 04:48.987
Drunken brawl broke out
between to sororities.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.728
We're keeping
the Lambda Nus up here,

04:50.772 --> 04:52.730
and the Kappa Gamma Kappas
are in holding on two.

04:52.774 --> 04:54.776
- They're all so mean.
- They're kids, Boyle.

04:54.819 --> 04:56.061
I'm sure they're just scared.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.153
Yeah, we're just scared kids.
Can we please go home now?

04:59.154 --> 05:00.982
I'm sorry, we have
to process you, but I promise

05:01.025 --> 05:02.318
we'll go as fast as we can.

05:02.319 --> 05:04.221
I hope you get shot
in the line of duty.

05:04.224 --> 05:05.703
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

05:05.747 --> 05:07.053
Brush it off, Sarge,
we've got an emergency.

05:07.096 --> 05:08.226
There's a hacker
in the building.

05:08.227 --> 05:10.374
Look for anyone you don't
recognize using a computer,

05:10.376 --> 05:11.185
or plugged in to a port.

05:11.188 --> 05:12.762
I initiated lockdown protocol.

05:12.763 --> 05:15.062
I'll search the fourth floor.
Peralta, Diaz,

05:15.105 --> 05:16.629
start on one, work your way up.

05:16.672 --> 05:18.518
Jeffords,
take Boyle, start on three,

05:18.519 --> 05:19.414
- work your way down.
- On it.

05:19.457 --> 05:20.720
I'll grab the keys
to the first floor.

05:20.948 --> 05:22.341
Smart.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.901
Ames, I love you,
but I can't talk right now.

05:24.902 --> 05:26.938
I just got an alert that
the Nine-Nine is on lockdown.

05:26.939 --> 05:27.673
I'm on my way.

05:27.674 --> 05:28.745
Wait, aren't you at the dentist?

05:28.746 --> 05:31.009
Yeah, I left. It's fine.
It's a new hygienist,

05:31.010 --> 05:33.327
and to be honest,
her scraping technique was a joke.

05:33.328 --> 05:35.281
We have 14 minutes
to find a hacker.

05:35.282 --> 05:36.306
You're not gonna
get back in time.

05:36.307 --> 05:37.704
But everybody else is there, right?

05:37.705 --> 05:40.285
I mean, it seems weird to have
this big thing happen without me.

05:40.286 --> 05:41.405
We talked about this, Amy.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.321
You have an unhealthy fear
of missing out on work.

05:43.322 --> 05:45.063
- You have FOMOW.
- This isn't FOMOW.

05:45.106 --> 05:46.804
It's not like
I'm freaking out or anything.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.459
Out of my way, you old bitch!
This cab is mine.

05:50.503 --> 05:53.645
I'll be there in 10 minutes. I love you.
Don't solve it without me.

05:53.646 --> 05:54.864
I got the keys.
Let's go.

05:55.952 --> 05:58.587
- Jocelyn.
- Jocelyn Pryce, hey.

05:58.588 --> 06:00.367
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the airport?

06:00.368 --> 06:03.100
Yeah, uh, I wanted to stop
and see you on the way there.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.103
- I think we need to talk.
- Why? Is something wrong?

06:05.146 --> 06:07.932
I should've done this last
night, but I chickened out.

06:07.975 --> 06:09.760
We need to break up.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.327
Ugh.
Mama Magglione.

06:14.725 --> 06:15.522
You want to break up?

06:15.523 --> 06:16.959
But I just met
your college friends.

06:17.003 --> 06:18.932
Are you telling me I had
to talk to Matt for nothing?

06:18.933 --> 06:20.108
- Rosa.
- I thought you liked Matt.

06:20.151 --> 06:22.730
Matt is a nightmare. He kept saying
"hashtag tell me about it."

06:22.731 --> 06:24.006
We should really get going.

06:24.007 --> 06:25.778
Listen, I just don't understand
why this is happening.

06:25.779 --> 06:29.981
Look, I love being with you,
but how often am I actually with you?

06:29.983 --> 06:31.681
- We're together every night.
- Unless you're at work,

06:31.724 --> 06:35.380
or doing work, or thinking about work.
It's like you never have time for me.

06:35.424 --> 06:37.077
I'm sorry, but Rosa
doesn't have time for you.

06:37.121 --> 06:38.601
We have a really
important work thing.

06:38.644 --> 06:40.255
That was bad.
Let me try rephrasing it.

06:40.298 --> 06:42.605
You are not as important
as Rosa's job.

06:42.648 --> 06:43.642
Oh, wow.
That was way worse.

06:43.643 --> 06:45.079
Look, we just have to take
care of this one thing.

06:45.122 --> 06:48.062
It's an emergency. Then I'll be right
back and we can talk about this.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.112
I really have
to get to the airport.

06:49.155 --> 06:51.481
- Please.
- Okay, fine.

06:51.482 --> 06:53.820
But I'm leaving in 10 minutes.

06:53.822 --> 06:56.825
Okay, just wait
in the break room.

06:56.869 --> 06:59.089
Don't sit on the couch.
It's full of farts.

07:00.687 --> 07:01.644
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

07:01.645 --> 07:02.868
I love being dumped.
It's super great.

07:02.870 --> 07:03.990
I think you're being sarcastic,

07:03.991 --> 07:07.125
but it's hard to tell with your
voice the way it always is.

07:07.168 --> 07:09.573
We just checked the third
floor. We didn't find anyone.

07:09.574 --> 07:11.446
- We're on our way to one.
- You didn't even start yet?

07:11.489 --> 07:12.719
Rosa took a long
time getting ready.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.183
You know how ladies be preppin'.

07:14.224 --> 07:17.514
Ow! I was just covering up the
truth so it wouldn't be awkward.

07:17.588 --> 07:19.448
Ooh, did something
awkward happen?

07:19.449 --> 07:21.722
I can probably relate.
Dish, bish.

07:21.725 --> 07:22.948
Rosa got dumped out of the blue

07:22.949 --> 07:24.472
because she cares so much
about her job and doesn't spend

07:24.516 --> 07:25.691
enough time with Jocelyn.

07:25.734 --> 07:27.258
Ow! There's no winning
with you.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.007
Oh, so you got dumped,
and you didn't see it coming.

07:30.008 --> 07:33.069
Oh, brother,
you are in Boyle Country.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.680
Here's what you're
gonna want to do.

07:34.723 --> 07:36.334
- Come on, Boyle.
- Beg her to take you back,

07:36.377 --> 07:39.076
and don't be afraid to cry.
I'm talking tears and snot.

07:40.599 --> 07:41.814
Quinn, did you get the alert?

07:41.815 --> 07:44.426
Yeah, but I haven't seen
anyone unusual down here.

07:44.470 --> 07:47.068
I mean, other than 1,000
Kappa Gamma Kappas.

07:47.069 --> 07:48.869
At least you didn't
have to deal with Lambda Nus.

07:48.870 --> 07:50.045
Those girls are savages.

07:50.088 --> 07:51.829
Right? We're the victims here.

07:51.873 --> 07:54.397
We have a nighttime event, and
if we don't make our blowouts,

07:54.440 --> 07:55.833
then we'll all look disgusting,

07:55.877 --> 07:58.053
and nobody will give
any money to the kids,

07:58.096 --> 08:00.098
or dogs, or whatever
the charity is.

08:00.142 --> 08:02.797
It's to buy shoes for poor
people so they can get jobs.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.450
- Yeah.
- We'll do our best,

08:04.494 --> 08:06.104
but it's possible
you're gonna miss your event.

08:06.148 --> 08:08.803
That's too bad, 'cause you
could use some decent shoes.

08:08.846 --> 08:10.369
What? Terry got
these at Aldo.

08:10.413 --> 08:12.719
- Was it buy one, get one?
- No, it wasn't.

08:12.763 --> 08:14.678
It was a three-for-one
Labor Day doorbuster.

08:14.721 --> 08:15.940
- Makes sense.
- Come on.

08:17.383 --> 08:18.474
Nobody on the fourth floor.

08:18.475 --> 08:20.133
Three is clear.
We're finishing up two.

08:20.135 --> 08:22.964
I gotta get out of here before
the sorority girls notice my tie.

08:23.008 --> 08:24.966
Just regroup in my office.

08:28.110 --> 08:29.765
- Go for Hitch.
- Hitchcock, damn it.

08:29.766 --> 08:31.775
I meant to call Peralta.
We're in the middle of a crisis.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.057
- Oh, no. Is it the lasagna?
- The what?

08:34.058 --> 08:35.592
Don't play dumb with me, Raymond.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.073
What's wrong with the lasagna?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.727
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

08:38.770 --> 08:39.975
What is it?
What's wrong with the lasagna?

08:39.976 --> 08:41.904
- Is it bubbling over?
- He won't tell me.

08:41.947 --> 08:44.006
Captain,
give us the damned information.

08:44.009 --> 08:45.333
Is it bubbling over?

08:45.334 --> 08:47.292
I don't have time
for these shenanigans.

08:47.336 --> 08:49.732
- What's the problem?
- He wouldn't say.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.082
Oh, no.
Then it must be bad.

08:51.126 --> 08:52.954
Call Jake.
He'll tell us the truth.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.840
- Hitchcock?
- Give it to us straight, man.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.304
- What's going on?
- Uh, just searching

08:59.305 --> 09:00.805
- the first floor.
- Searching the first floor?

09:00.806 --> 09:02.220
Why is the lasagna
on the first floor?

09:02.221 --> 09:03.745
Why is the lasagna
on the first floor?

09:03.788 --> 09:05.915
What? Are you talking about?
The lasagna is fine.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.875
Oh, thank God.
He says it's fine.

09:07.918 --> 09:10.024
Oh, you're a saint, Jakey.
I love you.

09:10.024 --> 09:12.678
Okay. Holt's texting me.
Love you, too.

09:14.593 --> 09:17.640
- Rosa! We gotta go up to Holt's.
- Is this not done yet? Ugh.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.812
Jocelyn leaves in eight minutes, and
I don't want things to end like this.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.034
Wow.
Way to be vulnerable.

09:22.077 --> 09:23.383
I thought for sure
you'd write her off

09:23.426 --> 09:24.927
the second she said
she wanted to break up.

09:24.928 --> 09:26.081
Yeah, I did.
She's dead to me.

09:26.143 --> 09:28.134
Wait? Then why are you so anxious
to get back up and talk to her?

09:28.136 --> 09:29.137
Because I have a plan.

09:29.181 --> 09:31.314
I'm gonna beg her to stay, change
whatever it is I need to change,

09:31.315 --> 09:32.829
then once our relationship
is stronger than ever,

09:32.830 --> 09:34.005
I'm gonna dump her ass so quick.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.659
It's gonna be brutal.

09:36.164 --> 09:37.775
Okay, I'm gonna try
and put this nicely.

09:37.818 --> 09:39.385
That is psychotic.

09:39.429 --> 09:40.908
Okay, maybe not psychotic,
but it's like something

09:40.952 --> 09:42.475
the lady
from "Killing Eve" would do.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.303
Not Sandra Oh, Villanelle.
You know, the crazy one

09:44.346 --> 09:45.783
who stabs everyone
with her hairpin.

09:45.826 --> 09:47.349
But... have you still
not watched "Killing Eve"?

09:47.401 --> 09:48.490
I've told you about it
so many times.

09:48.491 --> 09:49.666
Look, I've never lost a breakup,

09:49.709 --> 09:51.227
and I'm not starting now.
I'm 12-0.

09:51.228 --> 09:52.404
I'm always the dumper,
never the dumpee.

09:52.447 --> 09:55.102
I just don't think every breakup
has a winner and a loser.

09:55.145 --> 09:56.582
Sounds like somebody
who's lost all his breakups.

09:56.625 --> 09:57.912
Not all.

09:57.914 --> 10:01.048
- Maybe like half, max. Just...
- being generous.

10:02.221 --> 10:02.881
Hey, Ames.

10:02.882 --> 10:04.753
Cab was too slow.
Decided to walk.

10:04.797 --> 10:05.977
It's nice to take
a little stroll.

10:05.978 --> 10:07.556
You're clearly running
at full speed.

10:07.559 --> 10:09.555
- Whatever. How's it going there?
- Not great.

10:09.556 --> 10:10.422
We still haven't found the hacker.

10:10.423 --> 10:12.418
Oh, super.
I mean... oh, no.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.033
- Is Amy FOMOWing?
- Of course not.

10:14.034 --> 10:15.645
Big time.

10:15.688 --> 10:17.168
Okay, I gotta go, babe.
We're headed to Holt.

10:17.211 --> 10:18.474
Don't you dare hang up on me!

10:18.517 --> 10:19.488
I am part of this.

10:19.489 --> 10:21.766
Rosa, this is dumb.
I'm just gonna go.

10:21.768 --> 10:24.292
No, no, no. You promised me more
time. I still have seven minutes.

10:24.336 --> 10:27.053
I really don't want to miss my flight,
and I cannot physically stand

10:27.054 --> 10:28.259
the way that room
smells anymore.

10:28.260 --> 10:28.996
Just breathe through your mouth.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.829
Please, just stay here.
I'll be right back.

10:31.873 --> 10:33.484
We searched everywhere.

10:33.486 --> 10:35.772
No hacker.
Maybe he camouflaged himself.

10:35.837 --> 10:37.591
Maybe he's a real-life
Peeta Mellark, out there

10:37.634 --> 10:39.419
- looking like a river rock.
- I hate to say it,

10:39.462 --> 10:40.660
but maybe it's time we start thinking

10:40.661 --> 10:43.510
- about erasing the server.
- No, not until the last possible minute.

10:43.553 --> 10:44.438
What else can you do?

10:44.439 --> 10:45.503
I've been trying to pinpoint him.

10:45.504 --> 10:47.289
I've been making my way
through the server sockets,

10:47.332 --> 10:49.322
trying to determine which port
he's plugged into.

10:49.323 --> 10:51.368
What's going on?
I can't hear anything.

10:51.412 --> 10:52.718
Turn me around.
I'm missing everything.

10:52.761 --> 10:55.333
Part of the team.
What's up, team?

10:55.336 --> 10:57.903
Is Sergeant Santiago
suffering from FOMOW?

10:57.947 --> 10:59.688
No.

10:59.731 --> 11:01.124
What's happening?

11:01.168 --> 11:02.952
I think the hacker just
opened the holding cell.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.174
Mama Magglione.

11:10.314 --> 11:11.881
Oh, no.
They're running free.

11:11.883 --> 11:14.037
Everyone, cover up
your worst physical attributes.

11:14.038 --> 11:16.017
It's no use.
They could always find new ones.

11:16.018 --> 11:18.249
Why would the hacker
open the holding cell?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.688
Maybe he's trying
to create a distraction.

11:19.689 --> 11:21.546
I think he can see that I'm
closing in on his location.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.244
Then keep doing that.
The rest of you,

11:23.288 --> 11:24.550
get them back into holding.

11:24.594 --> 11:26.552
Oh, come on.
Get down from there.

11:26.596 --> 11:28.728
Do you know who my father is?
He's in business.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.817
That's where you actually
make money at your job.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.645
I make money.
I make good money.

11:32.689 --> 11:35.460
That can't be true. Otherwise,
you wouldn't still have that chin.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.608
What? Nobody ever said
anything about my chin?

11:37.610 --> 11:39.755
Boyle, is something wrong
with Terry's chin?

11:39.756 --> 11:41.880
- I don't want to get involved.
- Oh, my God. It's true.

11:41.881 --> 11:44.036
How is she running so fast
in those shoes?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.561
She's too drunk
to feel any pain.

11:48.128 --> 11:49.826
- Open up.
- No.

11:49.869 --> 11:52.132
You are trapped in a very
small room, and we can see you.

11:52.176 --> 11:53.264
What's your plan here?

11:53.307 --> 11:55.527
Shut up, I'm trying to think.

11:55.571 --> 11:56.876
If you come in here,

11:56.920 --> 11:59.183
I'll bite you with this
weird mouth thing.

11:59.226 --> 12:01.577
That is a staple remover,
and it's shocking you don't know that.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.404
Sorry, I'm not a secretary.

12:03.448 --> 12:04.710
I don't have time for this.

12:04.754 --> 12:06.277
My girlfriend leaves in three minutes.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.714
- You are ruining my life.
- You're ruining my life.

12:08.758 --> 12:11.891
I missed my Drybar appointment
without calling to cancel first.

12:11.935 --> 12:13.719
They keep record
of those things.

12:13.763 --> 12:16.113
Oh, my God, neither of your
lives are being ruined.

12:16.156 --> 12:18.133
I told you I'm not on board
with your psycho plan

12:18.134 --> 12:18.960
to destroy your girlfriend.

12:18.963 --> 12:22.880
I'm not gonna destroy her.
I actually want her back.

12:22.923 --> 12:24.403
I really love her, Jake.

12:24.447 --> 12:27.143
What? Rosa, then why'd you say all
that stuff about winning the breakup?

12:27.144 --> 12:29.063
Because it's weak and
humiliating to love someone.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.954
I lied to make myself
feel strong and normal.

12:30.955 --> 12:33.887
Right, that's definitely what came
across, how normal you were being.

12:35.257 --> 12:36.215
Don't let her go.

12:36.218 --> 12:38.307
You guys, I used to have
this boyfriend, Jason,

12:38.350 --> 12:41.538
then we broke up 'cause
I got drunk at Spring Fling

12:41.539 --> 12:44.977
and passed out in a bush, and
he took too long to find me,

12:45.028 --> 12:46.263
and now he's gone and it's like,

12:46.264 --> 12:48.807
there's no one to find me
when I pass out in a bush.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.809
I'm not sure
that totally applies here.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.811
No, she's right.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.030
I can't let Jocelyn go.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.379
Can you handle this without me?

12:55.422 --> 12:56.946
Yeah, it's under control.

12:56.989 --> 13:01.864
Go get Jocelyn back.
Jocelyn Pryce.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.824
Do you need to use a phone
to make a call?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.260
Gross, I don't know
any phone numbers.

13:08.044 --> 13:09.697
Where the hell did Jocelyn go?

13:09.741 --> 13:12.222
Elevator.
Tears and snot.

13:15.007 --> 13:16.400
Where are you going?
I still have one minute left.

13:16.443 --> 13:18.837
I'm leaving because
it's clearer to me than ever

13:18.881 --> 13:21.057
that your job is more important
to you than I am.

13:21.448 --> 13:22.885
That's not true!

13:22.928 --> 13:24.538
Sorry, ma'am, I can't
let anyone in or out.

13:24.582 --> 13:26.410
She's with me.

13:27.411 --> 13:29.282
You don't even apologize
blow me off.

13:29.326 --> 13:31.719
You just text
"Double homicide TTYL".

13:31.763 --> 13:33.199
Sometimes I add
those little heart emojis.

13:33.243 --> 13:35.854
You know how uncomfortable
that is for me.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.508
I'm sorry.
My job is hard.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.466
Yeah, it is, and it's
important, and you help people,

13:39.510 --> 13:41.207
but I need more.

13:42.078 --> 13:43.296
I promise I'll try.

13:43.340 --> 13:44.431
Honestly, I just don't
see it changing.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.563
Move, move, move!

13:45.607 --> 13:47.815
Oh, no, why are you outside?

13:47.816 --> 13:49.041
Is it over?
Did we catch the hacker?

13:49.044 --> 13:50.524
No, I have a personal thing
that's more important to me.

13:50.567 --> 13:55.747
Oh, yeah, work-life balance.
I have that, too.

13:56.486 --> 13:58.750
- Sorry, I can't...
- Andrew, it's me!

13:59.576 --> 14:00.795
Come on, come on, come on.

14:02.188 --> 14:03.319
Got it.

14:03.363 --> 14:04.364
What?

14:05.626 --> 14:06.627
- Time check.
- Five minutes, ten seconds.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.107
- It's over.
- Don't say that.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.499
We'll never get the garlic
bread toasted in time.

14:09.543 --> 14:10.892
- We can, and we will.
- How?

14:10.936 --> 14:12.154
We'll set the oven to 500.

14:12.198 --> 14:13.547
Are you insane?
It'll burn.

14:13.590 --> 14:14.853
We'll wrap it in foil.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.202
The foil will stick
to the cheese.

14:16.245 --> 14:19.031
That's a risk
we'll have to take.

14:19.727 --> 14:21.076
Move it.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.599
- Hey, you made it.
- Yeah.

14:22.643 --> 14:24.688
We finally got all the
Lambda Nus back into holding.

14:24.732 --> 14:26.125
Who are the Lambda Nus?

14:26.168 --> 14:27.604
Doesn't matter.
I'll read your notes later.

14:27.648 --> 14:28.997
I didn't take any notes.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.043
What the hell, Jake?
Do you even love me?

14:31.086 --> 14:32.522
Says the woman who
never once sent me flowers.

14:32.566 --> 14:34.829
Never mind, uh, we still
haven't found the hacker,

14:34.873 --> 14:36.135
but the cyber guy
is getting close.

14:36.178 --> 14:37.353
Okay, let's check in with Holt.

14:37.397 --> 14:39.007
Hold on to him, girl.

14:39.051 --> 14:41.705
He seems pretty sweet, and you
guys are like both sevens.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.098
Oh, come on.

14:43.142 --> 14:44.273
We only have two minutes left.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.840
I'm telling you,
I can't find him.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.060
Captain, maybe it's time
to face reality.

14:48.103 --> 14:49.452
We have to erase the servers.

14:49.496 --> 14:50.845
I'll initiate
the sequence for you.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.194
It just needs your passcode.

14:52.238 --> 14:54.544
Perhaps you're right.
How depressing.

14:54.588 --> 14:57.286
I never would've thought that
typing an intricate sequence

14:57.330 --> 15:00.022
of numbers from memory
would bring such sadness.

15:00.023 --> 15:01.590
Hi, I'm Sergeant Santiago.

15:01.633 --> 15:03.635
I'm sure these guys have
told you all about me already.

15:03.679 --> 15:06.370
Long story short, nothing
happens around here without me.

15:06.371 --> 15:07.981
What is that?

15:08.025 --> 15:09.678
We just got an NOS ping
from the first floor.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.811
The hacker is in room 103.

15:12.856 --> 15:14.901
Mama Magglione.

15:16.204 --> 15:18.698
Go, go!
Room 103!

15:18.701 --> 15:20.138
What are we gonna do?

15:20.181 --> 15:21.886
It's still frozen in the middle!

15:21.888 --> 15:23.194
Well, then turn up the temp.

15:23.237 --> 15:25.109
It's already at 500.
It's maxed out.

15:25.152 --> 15:26.850
Then set the motherf****
to broil!

15:26.893 --> 15:28.025
Okay!
Geez.

15:28.658 --> 15:30.545
I thought you said you searched
the entire first floor.

15:30.546 --> 15:32.567
I did. I even checked
the ceiling for clingers.

15:32.569 --> 15:33.689
Hey, who's that guy from Cyber?

15:33.690 --> 15:35.431
Sergeant Knox. We've been
talking computers all day.

15:35.474 --> 15:37.171
Pretty technical stuff.
I kept up.

15:37.215 --> 15:39.565
His face is really familiar.
I can't place him.

15:47.094 --> 15:48.225
It's empty.

15:48.226 --> 15:49.705
And there's nothing plugged
in to the internet port.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.098
But Knox said he got a NOS ping.

15:51.142 --> 15:54.060
I mean, NOSes don't just
ping themselves, guys.

15:54.063 --> 15:55.891
Jake, stop.
You're not fooling anybody.

15:55.935 --> 15:57.153
You don't anything
about computers.

15:57.197 --> 15:59.808
Oh, my God.

15:59.852 --> 16:01.462
You're right.
I'm not fooling anybody.

16:01.506 --> 16:03.295
I was fooled, Jakey.
You're my computer boy.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.880
No, no, no. I don't know anything
about computers. None of us do.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.361
And Knox could tell that.

16:08.405 --> 16:09.797
So he knew that
we wouldn't catch on

16:09.841 --> 16:11.277
if he just made stuff up.

16:11.321 --> 16:12.931
What if the reason
we can't find the hacker

16:12.974 --> 16:14.689
is because there is no hacker?

16:14.690 --> 16:16.183
Why would Knox lie about that?

16:16.185 --> 16:18.622
What if he doesn't actually care
what's on the LACMI servers?

16:18.666 --> 16:21.555
Maybe his real goal is to just trick
Holt into erasing all the servers.

16:21.556 --> 16:23.689
He might just be trying
to delete some evidence.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.430
So you think he's a criminal.

16:25.473 --> 16:27.432
Oh, my God.
We have to go right now.

16:27.475 --> 16:28.955
I know how I know Knox.

16:28.999 --> 16:32.017
He's the guy from the security
footage in the Avery Street murder.

16:32.019 --> 16:32.411
Are you sure?

16:32.413 --> 16:34.612
Yes, he shaved his beard,
but it's definitely him.

16:35.450 --> 16:36.684
- We have less than a minute.
- Call Holt.

16:36.686 --> 16:38.819
Knox is right next to him.
He'll hear everything.

16:38.862 --> 16:39.820
Here, I'll text him.

16:39.863 --> 16:40.995
I don't get it.

16:41.038 --> 16:42.475
Holt was about to erase
the servers.

16:42.518 --> 16:43.476
If that's what Knox wanted,

16:43.519 --> 16:44.651
why did he stop him

16:44.694 --> 16:46.174
and say the hacker
was in room 103?

16:46.217 --> 16:49.917
I don't know. Maybe to get rid of us.
No, to get rid of you.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.440
The second you showed up
in Holt's office,

16:51.484 --> 16:53.747
he sent us away
and the holding cell doors,

16:53.790 --> 16:56.010
they opened when I walked in
with Amy on my phone.

16:56.053 --> 16:58.273
He must've known
that she would recognize him.

16:58.316 --> 17:00.014
Why is this taking
so long to send?

17:02.843 --> 17:04.060
What's going on?

17:04.105 --> 17:05.540
We're running out of time here.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.542
Uh, sorry, it's uh...
From my husband, Kevin.

17:07.587 --> 17:09.196
Well, all due respect, but
you don't have time for that.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.729
You've got 15 seconds before
the hacker is inside the server.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.079
Uh, yes, uh... it's just that
Kevin just texted me some

17:14.124 --> 17:16.675
hot goss about our favorite
reality TV star.

17:16.678 --> 17:19.246
10 seconds.
Your agents' lives are at stake.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.141
- Eight, seven...
- Oh, I understand.

17:21.142 --> 17:23.971
I just have to find out
about the hot goss.

17:24.015 --> 17:27.410
"How certain are you?
Sincerely, Raymond Holt."

17:27.453 --> 17:30.326
"100 percent, sincerely"...

17:30.369 --> 17:32.806
Why am I doing that part?
Send.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.373
Okay, it said delivered.

17:35.069 --> 17:36.810
Make way, make way.

17:37.637 --> 17:39.378
Peralta, Santiago,
you'll be happy to know

17:39.422 --> 17:40.945
that I did not erase the server.

17:40.988 --> 17:41.865
Oh, thank God.

17:41.867 --> 17:45.936
But sad to know that Knox caught on
and is now holding me at gunpoint.

17:45.942 --> 17:46.900
Why not lead with that?

17:46.943 --> 17:48.423
Nobody has to get hurt.

17:48.467 --> 17:53.036
Just put your guns down,
and put your hands in the air.

17:55.343 --> 17:57.171
Hey! I said
put your guns down,

17:57.214 --> 17:58.259
and get your hands in the air.

17:58.302 --> 17:59.652
The bread, it's gonna burn.

17:59.695 --> 18:01.175
Guys, do what he says.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.698
I'll buy you all
the garlic bread you want.

18:02.742 --> 18:04.700
We're gonna hold you
to that, Sarge.

18:04.744 --> 18:07.964
Knox, you're pointing a gun
at an NYPD captain.

18:08.008 --> 18:09.009
Have you really thought
this through?

18:09.052 --> 18:10.314
This is not my fault.

18:10.358 --> 18:11.794
You were supposed to be
at the dentist.

18:11.838 --> 18:14.014
What?
How did you...

18:14.057 --> 18:15.015
You called me.

18:15.058 --> 18:16.451
He called me.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.192
He said he had a tip
for the officer in charge

18:18.235 --> 18:20.368
of the Avery murder.
I said I could meet any time

18:20.412 --> 18:21.935
except for this morning
because of the dentist.

18:21.978 --> 18:23.197
I had it all planned out.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.503
Guess you didn't count
on my FOMOW.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.584
Yeah, that's right.
It's crippling.

18:26.585 --> 18:28.634
Oh, picking a weird time,
but I'm glad you're finally owning it.

18:28.635 --> 18:29.475
Here's what's gonna happen.

18:29.478 --> 18:32.045
The captain and I are gonna
walk out of here real slow.

18:32.089 --> 18:33.612
No one's gonna move a muscle.

18:33.656 --> 18:35.745
Everyone's gonna be okay.

18:35.788 --> 18:37.050
Now we're just gonna move.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.819
He's down. He's down.
We got him.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.038
Jeffords, get him into holding.

18:46.082 --> 18:49.738
With pleasure.
You're about to have a really bad day.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.072
Give me that.

18:54.063 --> 18:56.152
Look at his pants, ladies.

18:56.189 --> 18:57.407
They're relaxed fit.

18:57.451 --> 18:59.714
Uh-oh.
Is that a braided belt?

19:00.933 --> 19:02.499
Whoa, what happened?

19:02.543 --> 19:04.110
You know what, forget it.
I'll just read Amy's notes.

19:04.153 --> 19:05.677
Why aren't you guys
on your way to the airport?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.766
Oh, I'm gonna miss my flight,
but it's worth it.

19:07.809 --> 19:10.333
It means a lot that Rosa bailed
on all this just for me.

19:10.377 --> 19:13.206
- Aww.
- You did what, Diaz?

19:13.249 --> 19:15.643
Now, sir, I told her
it was okay.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.037
If you're gonna be mad
at anyone, be mad at me.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.038
Okay, I am mad at you.

19:19.081 --> 19:20.561
What?
No.

19:20.605 --> 19:22.128
I didn't think you
were really gonna be mad.

19:22.171 --> 19:24.609
That's... that backfired.
Be mad at Rosa.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.220
Worst morning ever.

19:27.263 --> 19:30.136
Yeah, it was stressful,
but we got the guy.

19:30.179 --> 19:31.528
Surprised you two
are taking it so hard.

19:31.572 --> 19:34.314
We were talking about our lunch,
you self-absorbed son-of-a-bitch.

19:34.357 --> 19:35.707
- Come on.
- Look at this bread.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.882
It's completely inedible.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.362
There's not even any soft parts
in the middle we can pull out.

19:39.406 --> 19:40.330
Title of your sex tape?

19:40.331 --> 19:42.500
We cooked that lasagna for nothing.
Nothing!

19:42.501 --> 19:47.148
Okay. But have you ever considered
eating lasagna with no garlic bread?

19:47.255 --> 19:49.039
We've...

19:49.083 --> 19:50.650
Never done that before.

19:51.476 --> 19:53.000
I guess maybe
we could give it a try.

19:53.043 --> 19:54.566
What do you think, Hitchcock?

19:55.306 --> 19:58.057
What the hell. I had a feeling
something crazy was gonna happen today.

19:58.058 --> 19:59.407
There you go.

19:59.450 --> 20:01.409
It's almost ready.

20:02.453 --> 20:04.542
Mama Magglione.

20:17.164 --> 20:18.905
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
