00:00.210 --> 00:02.446
_

00:02.449 --> 00:04.182
We're just so happy that you're here

00:04.184 --> 00:05.383
to help take care of Nicky.

00:05.385 --> 00:07.051
 Un cochon.

00:07.053 --> 00:09.420
I-I-I don't see the point of
getting a nanny from Haiti

00:09.422 --> 00:10.855
who doesn't speak English.

00:10.857 --> 00:12.991
We need to look at
cutting back on staff.

00:12.993 --> 00:15.159
Cut back on more staff.

00:15.161 --> 00:16.894
What am I supposed to be doing?

00:16.896 --> 00:20.999
Those people are our responsibility.

00:21.001 --> 00:23.001
I don't want all of this

00:23.003 --> 00:24.402
to come between us.

00:24.404 --> 00:26.404
How come you never say
anything during group?

00:26.406 --> 00:27.839
Just don't have nothing to say.

00:27.841 --> 00:29.073
I'm pregnant again.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.675
And I'm not gonna keep it.

00:30.677 --> 00:32.409
The judge will grant the abortion

00:32.412 --> 00:34.212
if you're under 20 weeks.

00:37.917 --> 00:39.617
Just in case.

00:39.619 --> 00:41.019
My son.

00:41.021 --> 00:42.053
You killed him.

00:45.383 --> 00:46.815
Tell us about the farm.

00:52.065 --> 00:55.466
Why you care so much about the farm?

00:55.468 --> 00:58.770
Tell us about the workers,
their conditions, housing.

00:58.772 --> 01:00.304
My brother is dead!

01:02.108 --> 01:03.141
Somebody killed him.

01:03.143 --> 01:05.009
You don't give a damn about that?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.160 --> 01:22.493
People die all the time on that farm.

01:25.698 --> 01:27.732
Nobody cares.

01:29.836 --> 01:32.837
Women get raped regular.

01:33.740 --> 01:34.839
The workers...

01:34.841 --> 01:37.308
Sometimes we got like 15 or 20 of them

01:37.310 --> 01:39.944
living in a trailer, no air.

01:39.946 --> 01:41.846
Everybody knows they're firetraps.

01:41.848 --> 01:43.314
Farm owners know. That's why they...

01:43.316 --> 01:45.516
They make us house them off property.

01:49.355 --> 01:50.521
So if anything happens,

01:50.523 --> 01:52.156
they don't have to
take any of the blame.

01:52.158 --> 01:54.792
It's all set up so the
people up top don't get dirty.

01:57.730 --> 02:00.631
Tell me about the river.

02:00.633 --> 02:05.236
Diego, tell me about the river.

02:05.238 --> 02:07.572
Did your brother kill Teo Salazar?

02:08.473 --> 02:11.375
Did your brother put
his body in the river?

02:20.153 --> 02:23.020
We put a lot of bodies in that river.

02:53.686 --> 02:55.553
So, how does it work?

02:55.555 --> 02:59.357
Customers buy tokens online.

02:59.359 --> 03:03.094
There's a flat fee for
them to log on to the site.

03:03.096 --> 03:07.398
And they like what you're
doing, they'll tip you.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.819
It's all about earning tips.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.702
All right?

03:11.704 --> 03:14.739
They get off just talking,
talking's all you need.

03:16.276 --> 03:17.675
They want other stuff...

03:19.445 --> 03:22.280
it's just what you what you
want to do to get tipped.

03:24.884 --> 03:27.585
- You over 18?
- Yeah.

03:27.587 --> 03:29.687
Okay.

03:29.689 --> 03:32.023
- Good to go.
- Then you're all good.

03:32.025 --> 03:35.426
- Yeah, we could.
- Okay.

03:35.428 --> 03:38.596
I got to get...

03:39.599 --> 03:41.732
Is he cool?

03:41.734 --> 03:43.568
Everett?

03:43.570 --> 03:45.503
He's real cool.

03:45.505 --> 03:47.371
Pays on time.

03:47.373 --> 03:50.508
Soon as you make your tips, he pays.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.144
Have to help out around the house,

03:53.146 --> 03:57.415
do, uh, chores and stuff,
but that's about it.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.116
Doesn't want any nonsense.

03:59.118 --> 04:00.618
Just wants money.

04:02.388 --> 04:05.456
It's not like that hoin' you did before.

04:05.458 --> 04:08.259
It's like having a
regular arrangement...

04:08.261 --> 04:12.830
Log on, do your thing, log off.

04:14.701 --> 04:17.834
Just sayin', you want to make money...

04:24.043 --> 04:25.943
You don't do it like this.

04:28.047 --> 04:30.214
You can't go name by name.

04:32.919 --> 04:35.119
The cuts we have to make,

04:35.121 --> 04:37.555
we've got to do them wholesale.

04:38.758 --> 04:41.826
We've got to cut departments.

04:41.828 --> 04:44.462
We've got to cut entire shifts.

05:36.215 --> 05:38.849
Oh, my.

06:31.655 --> 06:33.379
You guys take care of him right?

06:33.382 --> 06:35.957
You better share!

06:38.310 --> 06:39.375

Ça va, aller.

07:49.581 --> 07:50.547
Bien.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.487
Mom, why don't we teach Gabrielle English?

08:11.489 --> 08:14.623
Because I want Gabrielle
to teach you French.

08:14.625 --> 08:18.027
Gabrielle, tell... tell Nicky
a little bit about your family.

08:18.029 --> 08:19.362

08:29.718 --> 08:31.136
_

08:31.511 --> 08:32.938
_

08:33.077 --> 08:35.510
Yves. Oh, so she has a son in Haiti.

08:35.513 --> 08:37.513
His name's Yves.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.787
_

08:57.944 --> 09:00.665
_

09:00.874 --> 09:02.830
_

09:02.901 --> 09:04.567
Je...

09:04.627 --> 09:06.629

09:09.299 --> 09:10.592

09:10.925 --> 09:12.510
_

09:13.967 --> 09:15.886
_

09:21.392 --> 09:24.960
Same game every time.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.842
Yeah. I'm telling you, right?

09:44.649 --> 09:46.749
Just going up to the room real quick.

09:47.885 --> 09:49.452
Uh, I would like a room.

09:49.454 --> 09:52.321
Okay. I just need a
credit card to secure the room

09:52.323 --> 09:53.823
and to cover any incidentals.

09:53.825 --> 09:55.191
Yeah.

09:57.762 --> 10:00.062
- There you go.
- Okay.

10:30.862 --> 10:31.994
Hello.

10:31.996 --> 10:34.296
What are you doing?

10:34.298 --> 10:37.133
H-How did you find me?

10:37.135 --> 10:38.501
What... What is it
that you think you're...

10:38.503 --> 10:40.803
Who told you? Who told you
where I'm a... where I'm at?

10:40.805 --> 10:41.937
Nobody told me.

10:41.939 --> 10:43.172
You checked in with the credit card.

10:43.174 --> 10:44.874
But why the hell are
you staying at a hotel?

10:44.876 --> 10:47.576
What... What is with...
With all the food?

10:47.578 --> 10:49.278
I left you a note.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.280
I couldn't understand the note.

10:51.282 --> 10:54.550
Well... it was very
clear what I was saying.

10:54.552 --> 10:55.818
Okay, you need to breathe.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.087
I mean, what the hell does that mean?

10:58.089 --> 11:03.726
Well, I-I need to
figure some things out,

11:03.728 --> 11:06.862
separate from you,
separate from the family.

11:06.864 --> 11:08.330
I don't understand what I did.

11:08.332 --> 11:10.833
No. You didn't do anything.

11:10.835 --> 11:13.869
- Then come home. Just come home.
- No, you didn't do anything.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.074
Hello?

11:19.076 --> 11:20.209
Hello, Jeanette?

11:20.211 --> 11:21.577
Just come home.

11:34.871 --> 11:36.759
- I'll meet you there.
- All right. Sounds good.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.394
Uh, I need to check out.

11:38.396 --> 11:40.496
Was there something wrong with the room?

11:40.498 --> 11:43.933
- Just get the car...
- I c... I can't stay here.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.106
Oh, yeah, well, I guess we will.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.774
Please consider adoption.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.676
There are so many families who
are looking for a child to love.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.978
If it's an option for
you, please call us at this number.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.948
- We'll do everything we can to help.
- We're happy to talk if you choose to.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.654
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.462
Uh-huh. So you'll...

12:44.464 --> 12:46.197
Yeah, so you'll...

12:46.199 --> 12:48.233
Okay. I found the
right room. Sorry about that.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.668
Oh, no problem.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.337
Thank you.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.750
_

13:20.100 --> 13:22.133
I don't want to do this.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.102
You don't want to... do...

13:26.673 --> 13:28.806
I don't want to do this.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.810
If you have the baby,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.846
how are you gonna take care of it?

13:36.616 --> 13:41.019
What are you gonna do
for food, for... clothes?

13:42.189 --> 13:44.055
I have the right to have a baby.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.391
I'm not saying you don't have the right.

13:46.393 --> 13:51.329
I'm just asking, how
are you gonna provide?

13:51.331 --> 13:56.301
If you go past 20 weeks,
you can't have the abortion.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.037
It's not your business what I do.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.743
It's not.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.189
If you want me to take
you to the shelter, I will.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.999
_

14:28.046 --> 14:30.286
_

14:30.286 --> 14:31.746
_

14:32.455 --> 14:33.530
_

14:34.107 --> 14:36.007
Hmm?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.243
Ok...

14:38.245 --> 14:40.578
Okay. _

14:40.887 --> 14:44.293
_

14:44.296 --> 14:45.965
_

14:46.419 --> 14:48.019
Okay.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.170
- Uh...
- Is there a problem?

15:06.172 --> 15:08.673
Well, it... it asks for work history.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.308
What if I don't have a history?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.476
None?

15:11.478 --> 15:15.380
Oh, I've been a housewife
for 23, 24 years and...

15:15.382 --> 15:17.749
You can put "housewife."

15:17.751 --> 15:20.418
- No shame in that.
- Well, I could...

15:20.420 --> 15:23.121
I could put down... I mean,
I-I would do a lot for Carson.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.589
Looking... Looking after a house

15:24.591 --> 15:27.592
and a husband, it is a full-time job.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.428
I know that from personal experience.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.596
Um...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.165
And...

15:37.170 --> 15:38.803
Oh, well, "pay stubs."

15:38.805 --> 15:41.839
Leave that blank.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.942
Just put your bank information.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.615
Well, it's, um...

15:50.617 --> 15:52.784
It's a joint account.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.218
I-It's just to establish

15:54.220 --> 15:55.820
a credit history for
the rental agreement.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.089
No, my husband and I, we're...

15:58.091 --> 15:59.857
Well, I-I...

15:59.859 --> 16:03.728
I need some time away,
and I'm not sure he,

16:03.730 --> 16:08.032
uh... he understands that yet.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.003
If you don't have some
kind of a personal account,

16:12.005 --> 16:14.238
you're not gonna be able to rent a room.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.941
Well, I ne...

16:16.943 --> 16:19.344
I need someplace to stay.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.412
If your husband is...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.014
Is he abusive to you?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.782
- There are shelters that you can...
- No, it's not...

16:24.784 --> 16:27.719
It... It's not like that.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.854
- No.
- Well...

16:29.856 --> 16:31.289
maybe you just want to work it out.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.557
My husband and me,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.093
we have all kinds of
things we have to deal with,

16:35.095 --> 16:39.330
but, uh, sometimes you just
have to deal with things.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.736
I don't want to start a battle.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.271
I-I don't want to fight
about money or anything.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.273
I just want enough
from Carson to live on.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.442
You want a settlement?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.244
No. No.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.980
We've been married for...
Oh, goodness, forever.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.883
We... We share everything.

16:58.885 --> 16:59.884
You want a divorce?

16:59.886 --> 17:01.352
No.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.622
I don't want a divorce.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.058
I want...

17:10.329 --> 17:12.930
24 years.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.769
You want a temporary separation?

17:17.771 --> 17:20.438
Mm...

17:25.178 --> 17:26.844
Yeah.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.146
Now, with a separation,

17:28.147 --> 17:31.649
your husband isn't required
to give you any support.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.752
- 24 years? How is he not required?
- Mrs. Hesby.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.288
Now, you can't file for divorce
until you and your husband

17:37.290 --> 17:40.091
have had a full year
of formal separation.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.427
That's the law in North Carolina.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.395
And if you formally separate,

17:44.397 --> 17:47.532
you can file for
post-separation support.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.307
But it could take three to
four months to get a hearing.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.043
Would you like to start the
process of formal separation?

18:02.916 --> 18:07.018
I'd be willing to do the
work on a contingency basis.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.487
I wouldn't bill you until
you settle with your husband.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.888
Oh, my.

18:22.273 --> 18:24.829
Nous ne serons sortis
que quelques heures.

18:24.831 --> 18:27.165
Sinon, je t'enverrai un text...

18:27.167 --> 18:30.566
Let's go, please.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.336
You gonna be good tonight, yeah?

18:32.338 --> 18:33.404
Clair, let's go.

18:33.406 --> 18:35.006
Okay. Okay.

18:35.008 --> 18:38.276
Oh, bonsoir.

18:57.931 --> 19:00.298
How long this thing
supposed to be tonight?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.320
- Just a couple hours.
- Okay.

19:02.323 --> 19:03.835
Well, you know, I don't want to be

19:03.837 --> 19:05.303
closing up the place, as usual.

19:07.574 --> 19:09.807
It will only be a couple hours.

19:09.809 --> 19:12.243
Okay, good.

19:12.245 --> 19:15.546
You didn't say good night to
Nicky when we left tonight.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.400
Well, I just think you needed...

19:42.909 --> 19:46.310
Well, you're doing good, too. I mean...

19:46.312 --> 19:49.147
Maybe she'll come back.

19:50.884 --> 19:54.285
People who've spent most
of their lives being exploited,

19:54.287 --> 19:57.889
it is very easy to
return to exploitation.

19:57.891 --> 20:00.525
I mean, even while being exploited,

20:00.527 --> 20:02.193
for a lot of the victims,

20:02.195 --> 20:07.231
it's like they have some
false sense of liberation.

20:07.233 --> 20:11.102
People who've been abused
most of their lives,

20:11.104 --> 20:13.171
they're led to believe

20:13.173 --> 20:17.141
that there's at least a
benefit to their circumstances.

20:17.143 --> 20:20.478
O-our organization has
partnered with Polaris.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.181
They're a nonprofit NGO...

20:23.183 --> 20:26.951
Established to combat
modern-day slavery

20:26.953 --> 20:28.319
and human trafficking.

20:32.525 --> 20:35.092
- Let me get another one.
- Sure. These.

20:35.094 --> 20:36.527
Thank you.

20:36.529 --> 20:39.363
- All right!
- You came!

20:39.365 --> 20:41.566
- I did.
- So good to see you.

20:41.568 --> 20:42.934
Good to see you, too.

20:42.936 --> 20:44.635
Modern-day slavery.

20:44.637 --> 20:47.572
In the rest of the
world, it's called a job.

20:47.574 --> 20:48.973
Drinking alone,

20:48.975 --> 20:50.875
or just drinking?

20:50.877 --> 20:52.643
Oh, uh, I got another 40 minutes to kill

20:52.645 --> 20:54.745
while my wife makes
friends with everybody here.

20:54.747 --> 20:56.031
Mm.

20:56.034 --> 20:58.716
Getting divorced added an extra
three hours back into my day.

20:58.718 --> 21:00.751
Yeah. I'll take you.

21:00.753 --> 21:01.886
Brent Welch.

21:01.888 --> 21:03.120
Uh, Nick Coates.

21:03.122 --> 21:04.755
- Coates?
- Mm-hmm.

21:04.757 --> 21:07.892
You, uh... You related
to the furniture company?

21:07.894 --> 21:09.627
Yeah, that's mine.

21:09.629 --> 21:11.195
No lie?

21:11.197 --> 21:13.231
"America's most comfortable furniture."

21:13.233 --> 21:15.099
I used to have a bunch of your stuff.

21:15.101 --> 21:16.400
Used to, huh?

21:16.402 --> 21:17.702
Wife took 'em.

21:17.704 --> 21:20.371
Put it in the settlement.
That's how good your stuff was.

21:20.373 --> 21:22.406
Mm.

21:22.408 --> 21:24.408
Was.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.111
And that's for damn sure.

21:27.113 --> 21:32.350
Eh... outsourcing,
yeah, it forced my hand.

21:32.352 --> 21:36.354
Regulators, uh, unions' taxes...

21:37.790 --> 21:39.790
I spent the last six years bleeding jobs

21:39.792 --> 21:41.659
to the other side of the planet.

21:41.661 --> 21:44.695
The minute you start talking
about trying to turn a profit,

21:44.697 --> 21:47.131
you... everybody accuses
you of corporate greed.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.233
Hell if they'll ever have
a night like this for us.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.237
Now... Now, to give you an idea

21:53.239 --> 21:55.406
of the numbers that
they're dealing with,

21:55.408 --> 22:00.977
21,000 calls came in to their
hotline last year nationwide.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.614
5,500 of those cases,

22:03.616 --> 22:07.251
they were identified
as human trafficking.

22:07.253 --> 22:11.589
75% of those involve sex trafficking,

22:11.591 --> 22:14.358
and a third of those involve minors.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.194
My daughter lives with her mother.

22:17.196 --> 22:19.363
No matter if she wants me
to pay for every damn thing

22:19.365 --> 22:21.299
she can right-click online.

22:21.301 --> 22:22.900
When she talks to me at all,

22:22.902 --> 22:25.636
she's riding me about
white male privilege.

22:25.638 --> 22:27.638
The myth of white male privilege.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.006
You got kids, Nick?

22:29.008 --> 22:30.541
Mm-hmm. One.

22:30.543 --> 22:32.076
He's five.

22:32.078 --> 22:33.678
Oh, that's great!

22:33.680 --> 22:35.313
Yeah, my, uh... My wife...

22:36.749 --> 22:38.849
Running around here somewhere.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.553
Anyway, she... She had her baby,

22:42.555 --> 22:44.422
and then, she, uh..

22:44.424 --> 22:46.791
Basically left the business.

22:46.793 --> 22:48.426
Should have another
platter for your bag.

22:48.428 --> 22:50.161
My wife never worked.

22:50.163 --> 22:51.395
It's beneath her.

22:51.397 --> 22:53.264
She's "Old South."

22:53.266 --> 22:54.432
Yeah. Do you want in?

22:55.468 --> 22:57.368
Yeah, wouldn't that be something?

22:57.370 --> 22:59.403
Yeah, you just...

22:59.405 --> 23:03.374
You just drop out and kick back at home.

23:03.376 --> 23:04.642
Okay.

23:04.644 --> 23:09.880
I should be able to retire
by the time I'm 89, 90.

23:16.189 --> 23:18.990
It's our burden except
we don't get a hashtag.

23:20.259 --> 23:22.626
Yeah, he's just starting.

23:22.628 --> 23:24.228
Yeah.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.396
Good to meet you.

23:25.398 --> 23:27.765
- Got her signals crossed.
- You're right.

23:30.436 --> 23:33.237
- Great to see you.
- So, how about...

23:35.108 --> 23:36.974
Oh. Hello.

23:36.976 --> 23:38.075
Hi.

23:38.077 --> 23:40.211
Thank you so much for your presentation.

23:40.213 --> 23:41.846
Oh. Thank you.

23:41.848 --> 23:46.017
I just... appreciate having the
chance to talk about the issue.

23:46.019 --> 23:47.351
Clair Coates.

23:47.353 --> 23:49.086
Kimar... Kamar... Kimara.

23:49.088 --> 23:50.121
- Kimara.
- Kimara.

23:50.123 --> 23:51.455
Yeah, nice to meet you, Clair.

23:51.457 --> 23:52.757
Nice to meet you.

23:52.759 --> 23:54.658
- Do you mind if I take a little seat?
- Oh, please.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.961
- Not at all, not at all.
- Thank you.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.264
You know...

24:00.266 --> 24:03.100
I was curious, what
you were talking about,

24:03.102 --> 24:05.236
about people being exploited.

24:05.238 --> 24:08.172
- Mm.
- It's not like it was...

24:08.174 --> 24:10.508
I mean, in... Like it was.

24:10.510 --> 24:13.244
I me... They have a choice.

24:13.246 --> 24:14.745
Mm-hmm.

24:14.747 --> 24:19.083
Um, uh, now, they don't
always have a choice.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.752
If your choice is between

24:21.754 --> 24:23.687
starving and selling yourself,

24:23.689 --> 24:25.289
what do you do?

24:25.291 --> 24:28.793
If your choice is between getting beaten

24:28.795 --> 24:32.363
or listening to what
your abuser tells you...

24:32.365 --> 24:35.099
dying or living...

24:35.101 --> 24:38.069
We're the ones that have the choice

24:38.071 --> 24:40.671
because we actually can do something.

24:40.673 --> 24:43.374
But I do. I see your...

24:45.945 --> 24:49.046
Yeah, I know. This,
um, can be depressing.

24:49.048 --> 24:51.115
Oh, no, no! No, my nanny... I th...

24:51.117 --> 24:53.584
I thought my nanny had texted,
'cause she's home with my son.

24:53.586 --> 24:54.685
She's new.

24:54.687 --> 24:55.953
Oh.

24:55.955 --> 24:57.354
How old is he?

24:57.356 --> 24:59.123
Nicky. He's five. He's five.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.891
It's... It's a great age.

25:00.893 --> 25:03.027
It's so great. Do you have children?

25:03.029 --> 25:05.329
No. No, no kids.

25:05.331 --> 25:07.565
Well, Nicky's my miracle baby.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.066
How so?

25:09.068 --> 25:11.469
I could not get pregnant.

25:11.471 --> 25:13.003
I tried for years...

25:13.005 --> 25:14.738
Third opinion, fourth.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.774
They told me I had to adopt.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.075
I just kept trying.

25:18.077 --> 25:21.512
I found a fertility clinic in Charlotte.

25:21.514 --> 25:22.913
Expensive.

25:22.915 --> 25:24.181
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

25:24.183 --> 25:27.384
It took nine IVF procedures
to conceive Nicky.

25:27.386 --> 25:28.586
Wow. That many?

25:28.588 --> 25:30.721
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:30.723 --> 25:33.958
It cost. It really did. It cost.

25:35.128 --> 25:37.461
But it was... It was worth every penny.

25:39.332 --> 25:41.499
Uh, you know, I'd like
to make a donation.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.901
I would like to make it
in the name of my son.

25:43.903 --> 25:46.670
Oh. Well, that... That's
much appreciated, Clair.

25:46.672 --> 25:48.572
What is the name of your organization?

25:48.574 --> 25:50.541
Project Open Road.

25:50.543 --> 25:52.009
Project Open Road?

25:52.011 --> 25:53.110
Yeah.

25:53.112 --> 25:54.612
Open road.

25:56.516 --> 25:59.517
Uh, well, you are doing...

25:59.519 --> 26:01.285
You're doing important work.

26:01.287 --> 26:03.220
Yeah, we like to think that we are.

26:03.222 --> 26:04.522
Well...

26:04.524 --> 26:05.956
Here to tell you you are.

26:05.958 --> 26:06.957
Mm.

26:06.959 --> 26:07.992
God bless.

26:07.994 --> 26:09.660
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

26:09.662 --> 26:12.696
Bye-bye now.

26:14.167 --> 26:17.134
Right.

26:17.136 --> 26:19.069
Looking good!

26:19.071 --> 26:21.605
I know, right? Thank you.

26:28.047 --> 26:29.513
- Yeah.
- Well, that was nice.

26:29.515 --> 26:31.315
Well, the drinks were overpriced.

26:31.317 --> 26:33.751
- Oh, it's a fundraiser.
- And watered down.

26:33.753 --> 26:35.757
Well, I think it's
nice getting together.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.454
- Take care, okay?
- Thanks, guys.

26:37.456 --> 26:41.225
Um, now aren't you glad
I hired Gabrielle, right,

26:41.227 --> 26:43.027
so we didn't have to
scramble for a sitter?

26:43.029 --> 26:44.995
Yeah, because it's
impossible to find a sitter

26:44.997 --> 26:47.064
unless you fly one in
from another country.

26:48.301 --> 26:49.934
I made a donation.

26:49.936 --> 26:51.902
What kind of donation?

26:51.904 --> 26:52.937
In Nicky's name.

26:52.939 --> 26:54.338
What kind of donation?

26:54.340 --> 26:56.073
$5,000.

26:56.075 --> 26:58.175
Are you... Are you kidding me, Clair?

26:58.177 --> 26:59.677
Well, it's a tax deduction.

26:59.679 --> 27:01.779
Y-You're an... You're an
accountant, for God's sake.

27:01.781 --> 27:03.047
You know that a business,

27:03.049 --> 27:04.882
i-it has to show a profit to...

27:04.884 --> 27:06.951
To take a write-off, don't you?

27:06.953 --> 27:08.719
What do you mean, to show you a profit?

27:08.721 --> 27:10.621
It's... It's just... It's not 
he best time, all right?

27:10.623 --> 27:12.156
If you need help with
accounting, I can help.

27:12.158 --> 27:13.567
No, the... the... What's
happening with the business

27:13.569 --> 27:15.292
is about more than creative bookkeeping.

27:15.294 --> 27:16.894
Wh... What's happening
with the business?

27:16.896 --> 27:18.562
It's, uh, what's going on
with any business.

27:18.564 --> 27:19.997
W-We need to compete.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.232
Is it bad?

27:21.234 --> 27:22.566
No, it's not bad.

27:22.568 --> 27:24.902
It's just... It's...
It's not a good time.

27:26.539 --> 27:28.172
Well, if you need help, I can help.

27:28.174 --> 27:29.340
- Uh, how?
- I...

27:29.342 --> 27:31.242
H-H-How are you gonna
help? What are you gonna do?

27:31.244 --> 27:33.043
What are you, gonna wave
a magic wand, Clair...

27:33.045 --> 27:34.378
Is that what you're
gonna do? And fix it?

27:34.380 --> 27:35.913
Y-You had your miracle baby, so, what,

27:35.915 --> 27:37.548
now you're capable of
miracles, is that it?

27:37.550 --> 27:38.682
You know, I hear you telling

27:38.684 --> 27:40.084
your silly little miracle-baby story

27:40.086 --> 27:41.185
to anybody who's gonna listen,

27:41.187 --> 27:42.319
and I'm gonna tell you something.

27:42.321 --> 27:45.155
You... It makes you like a
fool. You look like a damn fool.

27:45.157 --> 27:46.423
Well, it's... It's heartwarming

27:46.425 --> 27:47.725
how you've taken to fatherhood.

27:47.727 --> 27:49.026
Oh, is it really heartwar...

27:49.028 --> 27:50.928
Well, I'm killing myself seven
days a week in that office.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.263
What the hell are you doing?

27:52.265 --> 27:53.998
Huh, what are you doing all day, Clair?

27:54.000 --> 27:54.864
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

27:54.866 --> 27:57.534
We hired a nanny so you can
just sit around and write checks.

27:57.536 --> 27:59.536
I hired a nanny so there'd
be somebody else in the house

27:59.538 --> 28:01.472
to help take care of our son.

28:48.416 --> 28:50.583
- Hey, Kimara.
- Hey.

28:50.585 --> 28:52.719
Uh, I can't let you
in. It's after curfew.

28:52.721 --> 28:55.388
Oh, I know. I just came to
drop something by for Shae.

28:55.390 --> 28:57.056
Shae?

28:57.058 --> 28:58.791
She's not here.

28:58.793 --> 29:01.060
But it's... past curfew.

29:01.062 --> 29:03.162
Yeah, she checked out a couple hours ago.

29:03.164 --> 29:04.731
Checked out and went where?

29:04.733 --> 29:06.899
Didn't say nothing. Just left.

29:06.901 --> 29:08.668
She's not at the shelter.

29:08.670 --> 29:11.871
I understand, but I can't spare anyone.

29:11.873 --> 29:13.906
I did for you.

29:13.908 --> 29:15.575
I g... I-I tried to get her to

29:15.577 --> 29:17.877
testify against her pimp for you.

29:17.879 --> 29:19.912
You did your job.

29:19.914 --> 29:22.315
Then do your job and find her.

29:22.317 --> 29:23.916
With who?

29:23.918 --> 29:26.319
My whole staff got shifted.

29:26.321 --> 29:28.755
Now the D.A. is doubling down on

29:28.757 --> 29:30.923
abuses in the local ag business.

29:30.925 --> 29:33.159
Shae is 17. She's a minor.

29:33.161 --> 29:35.728
There are minors on the farms, too.

29:35.730 --> 29:39.732
There's... There's forced labor,
there's rape, there's murder.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.834
Sex trafficking takes a
back seat to all of that.

29:41.836 --> 29:43.369
And I've got a missing child.

29:43.371 --> 29:44.837
That's my priority.

29:46.241 --> 29:50.309
Look, the D.A. decides
which cases to build.

29:50.311 --> 29:52.578
He doesn't ask what I want to chase.

29:52.580 --> 29:57.250
I just do what they tell me to do.

30:13.468 --> 30:16.269
All right. Come see?

30:23.812 --> 30:25.578
What's a good name to use?

30:25.580 --> 30:28.147
Uh, Brandy.

30:28.149 --> 30:29.982
Brandy?

30:31.019 --> 30:34.387
Come on, that sounds like an alcoholic.

30:34.389 --> 30:36.456
Do "Cassi."

30:36.458 --> 30:37.590
Who's Cassi?

30:37.592 --> 30:39.058
I don't know.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.994
Just sounds like some girl
I'd like to have sex with.

30:54.342 --> 30:56.008
You doing okay?

31:00.949 --> 31:04.050
There's food in the freezer.

31:04.052 --> 31:06.552
I'm getting by.

31:07.689 --> 31:09.789
Did you plan all this?

31:09.791 --> 31:11.991
No. I don't want to argue.

31:11.993 --> 31:13.659
I don't want to argue,

31:13.661 --> 31:15.995
but I'm not the one who walked out.

31:15.997 --> 31:19.899
I'm not the one who decided

31:19.901 --> 31:23.903
that leaving a bunch of
food behind was gonna...

31:23.905 --> 31:26.606
I...

31:26.608 --> 31:31.711
I don't understand what is going on.

31:31.713 --> 31:35.948
This all because I wouldn't
let you help those people?

31:38.953 --> 31:41.053
They died, and you don't care.

31:41.055 --> 31:44.056
If you... if you want to
help, we can go to a shelter.

31:44.058 --> 31:45.725
We could...

31:45.727 --> 31:49.529
I want...

31:49.531 --> 31:53.132
Can you...

31:56.804 --> 31:58.905
I...

32:04.846 --> 32:07.079
I need some money, Carson.

32:07.081 --> 32:08.614
To live on.

32:08.616 --> 32:10.750
For the time being.

32:17.496 --> 32:19.859
Well, what's the time being?

32:23.331 --> 32:26.599
I just want to be on my own.

32:28.002 --> 32:32.672
If you want to be in
our own, be on your own.

32:32.674 --> 32:35.575
Did I ever treat you badly?
Did I ever cheat on you?

32:35.577 --> 32:38.010
Do you even understand why I left you?

32:38.012 --> 32:39.345
I gave you everything I had.

32:39.347 --> 32:41.714
- I don't have anything.
- Geez.

32:41.716 --> 32:44.817
I don't... I don't have
anything that's mine.

32:46.148 --> 32:47.954
Oh, is that... Is that the problem?

32:47.956 --> 32:49.422
I treated you too good?

32:49.424 --> 32:52.224
I was... I was too
good a husband to you?

32:52.226 --> 32:54.660
People died, and you denied it.

32:54.662 --> 32:57.597
I tried to do right, and you stopped me.

32:57.599 --> 32:59.665
You sat across from your sister...

32:59.667 --> 33:01.467
My father is dying. Our father is dying.

33:01.469 --> 33:03.803
And treated me like a stranger.

33:03.805 --> 33:05.871
That's what hurts the most.

33:14.782 --> 33:16.616
We should've had kids.

33:19.053 --> 33:22.121
We didn't want children.

33:22.123 --> 33:25.891
We should've... should've
given ourselves something.

33:27.562 --> 33:31.263
Something so that our
lives weren't just about us.

33:31.265 --> 33:32.798
And we... We... we did.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.234
We let ourselves get too selfish.

33:35.236 --> 33:37.670
- Stop it.
- It was all about the farm.

33:37.672 --> 33:40.873
And I don't know that the
farm's gonna be around much more.

33:42.677 --> 33:44.744
We got police coming by every day now.

33:44.746 --> 33:47.747
We got Spanish-speaking investigators

33:47.749 --> 33:49.815
coming by to talk to workers.

33:49.817 --> 33:53.252
They're looking to pin this on somebody.

33:54.656 --> 33:57.623
This nonsense.

33:57.625 --> 34:00.026
Nonsense?

34:00.028 --> 34:02.194
You and JD.

34:03.765 --> 34:06.732
You stirred this up,

34:06.734 --> 34:09.135
and now you want to walk away

34:09.137 --> 34:11.469
and leave me and Laurie
Ann holding the bag.

34:11.472 --> 34:15.675
Then send me an address,

34:15.677 --> 34:19.210
and I'll write you monthly allowances

34:19.213 --> 34:22.014
until you get over yourself.

34:24.619 --> 34:26.585
I don't want a handout.

34:26.587 --> 34:28.219
I want what's owed me.

34:28.222 --> 34:29.455
Owed?

34:29.456 --> 34:31.690
For what?

34:33.860 --> 34:35.428
It's...

34:36.563 --> 34:40.900
If this is about who owes who,

34:40.902 --> 34:44.203
the judge can sort that out.

35:17.238 --> 35:19.572
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:25.546 --> 35:27.213
I left him.

35:27.215 --> 35:30.483
I... I left Carson.

35:33.254 --> 35:36.355
Can I stay with you and the girls?

35:41.629 --> 35:43.395
Come on in.

35:45.466 --> 35:48.467
Okay.

35:49.504 --> 35:51.537
Oh.

36:03.114 --> 36:06.015
Les mains en bas. Tape, tape.

36:08.987 --> 36:10.319
Okay, très biens.

36:10.321 --> 36:11.721
Maintenant la chanson.

36:11.723 --> 36:14.290

36:14.292 --> 36:17.093

36:30.664 --> 36:32.531

36:32.577 --> 36:34.910
You okay?

36:37.348 --> 36:38.848

_

36:59.963 --> 37:02.178
_

37:16.954 --> 37:18.587
So, I need lay-off notices

37:18.589 --> 37:20.356
for Burlington and Charlotte to go out.

37:20.358 --> 37:22.625
I'll get them out today.

37:22.627 --> 37:25.561
Make sure that HR at
both plants understands

37:25.563 --> 37:27.827
that we can't offer a
severance package... none.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.763
Yeah.

37:29.765 --> 37:33.534
Uh, now, should we plan on
any pushback from the union?

37:33.536 --> 37:35.502
They'll picket the shuttered plants.

37:35.504 --> 37:38.739
Week or so of that, they'll
get bored and go home.

37:38.741 --> 37:40.808
Hm.

37:40.810 --> 37:42.743
You're doing the right thing.

37:42.752 --> 37:44.685
Hm.

37:48.117 --> 37:50.951
The right thing.

38:00.062 --> 38:02.229
Hello.

38:02.231 --> 38:04.732
I need help.

38:07.370 --> 38:10.537
Who am I speaking with?

38:10.539 --> 38:12.773
Vanessa.

38:12.775 --> 38:16.009
Vanessa, this is Kimara.

38:16.011 --> 38:18.545
Talk to me. What's going on?

38:18.547 --> 38:21.982
My john's in the other room.

38:21.984 --> 38:23.884
He hit me.

38:23.886 --> 38:26.019
I'm bleeding.

38:26.021 --> 38:27.654
Is he threatening you now?

38:27.656 --> 38:30.224
I think he's passed out, but
I'm afraid to go out there.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.226
Kimara, the phone's dying.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.995
Okay, okay. Did you call 911?

38:34.997 --> 38:36.430
They won't come.

38:36.432 --> 38:38.532
I don't want to do this.

38:38.534 --> 38:40.134
I don't want to do this anymore.

38:40.136 --> 38:41.769
I want to go home.

38:41.771 --> 38:42.903
All right, all right.

38:42.905 --> 38:44.671
Well, where are you?

38:44.673 --> 38:45.939
A motel.

38:45.941 --> 38:49.410
Okay, look, I... I want you
to look around the bathroom

38:49.412 --> 38:52.513
and try to find something
with the motel's name on it.

38:52.515 --> 38:54.848
Pine Ridge.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.252
- Kimara?
- Yeah?

38:58.254 --> 38:59.953
- Are you there?
- I'm... I'm here.

38:59.955 --> 39:01.889
I'm gonna stay on the phone with you.

39:01.891 --> 39:03.490
I'm scared.

39:03.492 --> 39:05.325
I know you are.

39:06.662 --> 39:08.595
Kimara, the phone's dying.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.030
Okay.

39:10.032 --> 39:11.665
- All right, listen.
- It's dying.

39:11.667 --> 39:12.933
When I get to the parking lot,

39:12.935 --> 39:15.102
I'm gonna honk my horn three times.

39:16.071 --> 39:18.439
Vanessa.

39:18.514 --> 39:20.311
Vanessa.

40:06.922 --> 40:08.655
Hey!

40:08.657 --> 40:11.258
Hey, you're not done!

40:11.260 --> 40:12.459
Keep moving. Keep moving, come on.

40:12.461 --> 40:13.794
Come on, get in the car.

40:13.796 --> 40:16.029
What'd you say?
