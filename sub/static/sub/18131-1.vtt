Yo, man. Come on!

00:43.585 --> 00:45.086
Eighteen to party,
21 to drink.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.088
Have your IDs ready,
ladies.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
Eighteen to party,
21 to drink.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.040
Oh, my God.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.461

01:26.837 --> 01:28.671

01:28.881 --> 01:31.549
Now where are all my sexy
Sagittarian ladies at?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.052
Man, where your dollars?
Where your dollars at?

01:35.512 --> 01:36.929
Man, she doin' it, y'all.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.181
Chill, chill.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.474

01:39.558 --> 01:41.851
Oh, come on, baby,
I'm not going to bite.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.270
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.040
Come on now. Let's go.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.750
Yeah, it's your girl K-Sty.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.627
You know you're rocking
with your girl K-Sty.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.920
We're live at the Catnip Lounge.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.805
Give it up for your girl Maine.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.890
Maine's in the building.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.812
Come on, we're late. Huh?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.396
I gotta go.
Hold on a minute.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.232
- Why you trippin'?
- What?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.859
I gotta go. Why are you trippin'?
I'm gonna get in trouble.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.903
Let me dance with shortie right
quick and then I'll be ready.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.071
What?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.033
Stop pulling on my clothes, yo.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.117
Sorry.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.423
- How many numbers you get?
- One?

02:54.758 --> 02:57.593
I could've gotten more
but your moms was holdin' me up.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.845
That's messed up.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.638
How many you get?
How many you get?

03:00.764 --> 03:02.306
Oh. Let me see.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.978
Tonya, Denise, Shelley...

03:07.104 --> 03:09.021
Oh, wait, that's an old
one, I could delete that one.

03:09.773 --> 03:10.773
So, Tonya...

03:10.858 --> 03:12.275
Hold up. Liar.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.360
Ain't Shelley that chick
from your math class?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.279
Give me!
Denise?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.156
Yo, hold up, these are your
damn study group numbers, yo.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.533
Why you frontin', huh?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.285
I don't see you
with no list of numbers.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.203
I'm not the one looking
for a girlfriend, man.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.705
You the one still a virgin!

03:26.665 --> 03:28.291
Trying to help your ass,
you know what I'm saying?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.543
I don't know what you waitin' on.
Shit.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.880
Still kickin' that quiet
shit from sixth grade, nigga.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.923
I don't need to press,
I gets plenty. You feel me?

03:36.008 --> 03:38.676
Wah-wah. Look, I get more
pussy than your daddy, nigga.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.846
What?
Okay, you got me with that one.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.890
- You got me with that one.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.600
You need to pop
that damn cherry, yo.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.767
Shut up.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.394
That's what you need to do.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.904
- Quit playing.
- Your stop.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.030
Huh?

03:59.156 --> 04:00.573
Your stop.
Time to get off.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.825
Nah, I'm gonna roll with
you a few more stops, a'ight?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.702
Why are you gonna go all
the way up to come back down?

04:04.828 --> 04:05.912
Make sure you get home safe.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.121
I don't need your protection.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.040
You ain't big, nigga, get off.
Hey, yo!

04:09.166 --> 04:10.374
That's a'ight, man.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.876
Yo, yo, yo.
Next stop.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.169
- A'ight?
- Would you get off the bus?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.254
Yo, what you pushin' me for?
Why're you beastin'?

04:15.339 --> 04:17.632
I'm not beastin'.
Just get off!

04:18.050 --> 04:19.382
Tsk.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.849
You got a problem.
Yo, call me.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.726
I'll call you. Bye.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.783
- You're late.
- Be quiet.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.368
- Where you been this late?
- Movies.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.287
Movies ended at midnight.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.289
- Shut up.
- Don't push me.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.124
I know what stays open
past midnight.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.139
Good for you.
Go to sleep.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.025
Goodnight, Lee.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.069
Lee?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.472
Nice to know you still live here.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.557
What are you doing home
so late, anyway?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.310
Lost track of time.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.812
You know what time
your curfew is.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.064
Where were you?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.648
Movies.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.400
The movie ended at midnight

06:41.485 --> 06:42.735
and your curfew's
at 12:30.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.653
I lost track of time.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.826
Well, at least you were cute.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.245
I like that shirt.
Where'd you get that from?

06:53.297 --> 06:54.413
Angel.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.706
It's old.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.084
Really compliments
your figure.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.252
You know, maybe we can go
shopping. I saw one just like it...

07:00.337 --> 07:01.837
Goodnight, Ma.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.538
You know what?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.218
I don't like that young lady
that you run around with.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.344
Yeah, okay!

07:08.470 --> 07:10.805
Yeah, okay!
And tie up your head.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.057
It's your head.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.518
- And wash your face, too!
- I don't have makeup on.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.685
Wash your face, anyway!

07:16.812 --> 07:18.187
Mom, I'm seventeen years old.
Can you please...

07:18.313 --> 07:20.397
You need to watch your tone!

07:23.068 --> 07:24.693
It's your skin.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.879
All right, as I promised, people,

08:24.963 --> 08:27.298
these will be graded
on a curve.

08:27.464 --> 08:30.509
So, you're not going to get
a whole lot of help unfortunately

08:30.561 --> 08:35.794
because the highest score
on the test was a 98.

08:35.818 --> 08:37.390
- Very good job. - This wasn't
even in the study guide...

08:37.475 --> 08:39.058
Guys, I gave you all the answers

08:39.144 --> 08:40.929
and the questions
on the review sheets.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.272
It was on the test.
I didn't say that.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.400
Y'all have a good lunch.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

08:46.452 --> 08:47.943
Study, people.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.591
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.718
How you doing?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.178
Talk to me.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.599
You eat that shit?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.851
I do. I don't know
about what you eatin'.

09:21.101 --> 09:23.062
Tastes good.
You should try it.

09:23.146 --> 09:26.106
Yeah, listen, hummus will keep me
alive longer than that.

09:27.065 --> 09:29.151
So, where's the new stuff?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.528
Here you go.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.209
Hmm.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.020
Do you see the one
in the back?

09:49.044 --> 09:50.846
I'm gonna... I'll
probably do that in class.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.348
Hmm.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.523
So?

10:07.941 --> 10:08.941
So what?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.150
So what'd you think?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.610
Yeah, they're okay.

10:11.695 --> 10:12.820
Okay?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.281
Well, they're lovely.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.465
I mean, of course
your descriptiveness

10:18.489 --> 10:21.524
and your use of alliteration
are beautiful and all, but

10:21.621 --> 10:23.030
you know that.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.873
But I don't know, is it your best?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.041
No.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.294
I thought it was good.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.337
They're okay. Not great.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.549
I think you can go deeper.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.806
I'm not able to take your call.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.558
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

10:42.610 --> 10:43.976
Peace.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.241
Hey, this is Lee, I'm not able
to take your call...

10:59.326 --> 11:00.909
How's it coming?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.411
It's good.

11:12.285 --> 11:13.819
Let me know if you need me.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.263
I don't see why we can't just
watch TV like usual.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.431
Shut up.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.600
- You shut up!
- Girls!

11:27.604 --> 11:29.563
I was expecting a call.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.611
Hello?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.447
Yeah.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.949
It's your father's night off.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.618
Straighten up.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.710
So, Homecoming got moved up this year.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.447
It's actually going to be in September
instead of October.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.089
Really?

11:55.141 --> 11:57.124
Yeah, which means that I can actually
go to the Autumn Ball

11:57.168 --> 11:58.276
and the Homecoming Dance.

11:58.328 --> 11:59.249
Who're you going to go with?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.720
I don't know, uh, maybe Derek,
if he asks me.

12:01.805 --> 12:02.794
Or maybe Parrish.

12:02.846 --> 12:05.140
But I know for Homecoming that I
definitely want to go with Craig.

12:06.724 --> 12:08.977
And who are you going
to go with, Lee?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.562
I'm not going.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.065
What do you mean, you're not going?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.233
It's your junior year!

12:14.317 --> 12:15.401
Leave her alone, Audrey.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.403
If she doesn't want to go,
she doesn't have to go.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.072
But she's a junior. She's not going
to have any memories!

12:20.156 --> 12:21.869
I don't like all those boys buzzing
around my daughters.

12:21.921 --> 12:23.807
- Nobody's buzzing around Alike.
- That's right.

12:23.831 --> 12:25.219
And it better stay that way.

12:25.243 --> 12:26.662
Matter of fact, I'm not
sure if I'm gonna let you go.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.456
Dad!

12:28.508 --> 12:30.124
Shut up!

12:31.459 --> 12:33.480
So what are
your memories, Mother?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.254
I got plenty of memories.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.755
Like?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.508
I'm just saying, share with us.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.759
Did you go to prom?

12:40.844 --> 12:42.094
Yes, I went to prom.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.887
Who'd you go with?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.598
Are you comfortable
with this?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.726
I'm fine.
She asked you.

12:48.778 --> 12:50.519
Did you have sex at prom?

12:50.603 --> 12:51.895
Hey, hey, hey!

12:51.980 --> 12:53.814
Relax.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.108
I'm definitely having sex at prom.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.568
Oh, my God!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.278
No, you're definitely not going
to prom.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.655
You're not having sex
for ten more years, so...

13:02.323 --> 13:03.407
Ten years?

13:03.491 --> 13:04.783
At least.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.577
That's like 25!

13:06.661 --> 13:07.619
Exactly.
That's early for me.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.871
That's an inappropriate question.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.582
Is that how old you were
when you first had sex?

13:11.666 --> 13:12.791
That's how old you'll be
when you find out.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.710
This isn't dinner conversation.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.503
- Okay.
- Guys...

13:26.097 --> 13:28.557
Oh. Oh, my God.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.935
That's just embarrassing, girl.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.145
You ain't got no range either!

13:33.229 --> 13:35.022
Well, at least I hit
the backboard, damn.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.360
Help!
I'm getting mugged!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.364
Girl. Come on, what's the score?

13:44.782 --> 13:45.908
One up.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.075
- One?
- Yup.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.745
Girl, I got at least three.
Definitely three, come on.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.246
You trying to cheat me, too?

13:53.917 --> 13:55.167
Help me!

14:37.001 --> 14:38.877
Hey! Hey, hey.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.504
Mind if I sit here?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.047
Sure, go ahead.
Help yourself.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.966
Oh, thank you.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.260
What you got there?
You been shopping?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.345
- Mmm-mmm.
- Just some yogurt.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.639
Some vanilla yogurt.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.599
No, I mean in the bag.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.519
What do you got in the bag?
That big red thing?

14:55.603 --> 14:56.812
Oh...

14:56.938 --> 14:58.855
I don't know
where my mind is.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.315
- That's okay.
- Um...

15:00.400 --> 15:01.900
Yeah, let me...
Let me show it to you.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.777
Okay.
Can I get your opinion?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.321
Oh.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.532
That's really nice.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.438
Isn't that cute?

15:09.490 --> 15:11.618
Yeah!
Is that for your daughter?

15:11.828 --> 15:13.579
Yeah, yeah.
It's for Alike.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.455
Oh, the youngest one.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.374
No, the oldest one.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.418
Oh, the other one.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.837
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.590
Why, you think it's too young?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.800
Oh, no! For some reason
the youngest one

15:26.884 --> 15:28.927
just popped into my
head first, that's all.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.763
Oh, but I think it'll be fine.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.181
Oh, it's really nice.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.516
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.643
And you know what, it'll
compliment her figure.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.645
- You see, that's what I thought.
- Yeah.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.759
For some reason Lee just doesn't like
anything I pick out for her anymore.

15:42.015 --> 15:43.375
Oh, girl, please.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.535
My oldest has banned me from
buying her any more clothes.

15:46.861 --> 15:49.114
I just get her gift cards now.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.699
Trust me,
we're both happier for it.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.701
- She needs to go on a diet.
- Anyway...

15:55.246 --> 15:56.872
- Hey, Brenda!
- Hey!

15:57.332 --> 15:59.374
Audrey, you got
me a present!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.667
No, I didn't.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.002
What y'all in here talking about?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.920
None of your damn business.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.255
Let me know
how it goes, okay?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.798
Okay, I will.
Hey, Bren...

16:06.883 --> 16:08.800
This is the article
I was telling you about.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.552
- Oh, no.
- Is that her?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.679
I told you!
Look how big she done got!

16:12.764 --> 16:15.682
Oh, my gosh. That's a shame!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.517
Isn't that crazy?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.703
So, it was, like, seven of us.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.331
Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara...

16:39.415 --> 16:40.832
Tamara Marks?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.042
Hell, no. Fat Tamara.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.461
Oh, I was about to say.
Tamara Marks is a...

16:44.587 --> 16:46.171
Uh, I can't stand her.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.590
Anyway, it was all of us,
and oh, Laura.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.716
You know that girl
from the restaurant?

16:49.801 --> 16:51.344
She was there with
one of her friends.

16:51.368 --> 16:52.484
The gay chick?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.680
Y'all be hanging out like that?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.839
Anyway,
there's a couple of them.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.976
She's mad cool though, so she
come out with us every now and...

17:00.061 --> 17:01.670
Man, y'all be doing it
big on the weekends.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.921
Let me know!

17:02.945 --> 17:04.647
- I told your butt to come.
- But anyway...

17:04.732 --> 17:07.483
Yo, some of them AGs
are kinda cute.

17:07.536 --> 17:10.237
I'm not saying I would,
but I'll holla.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.946
I don't know about all that.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.781
Yo, isn't that one
of them over there?

17:14.826 --> 17:17.493
What's her name?
Amika? Alisha?

17:17.578 --> 17:18.869
Alike.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.079
Yeah, Alike.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.332
She's cute, too.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.501
I don't be looking at them like that.

17:24.585 --> 17:28.255
Look, I'm not gay, but if I
was gay, I might talk to her!

17:28.339 --> 17:29.631
She's in the middle anyway.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.135
Yeah, I know, if she was
just a little bit harder...

17:34.137 --> 17:35.846
What's up, ladies?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.348
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what's up?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.558
- What's going on?
- Hey.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.976
What's good?
What's good with that party?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.185
What's good with this hat?

17:44.837 --> 17:46.668
- Don't play me.
- Yo!

17:46.899 --> 17:49.495
Oh, Mika, you act like
you bi or something.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.295
I like girls.
I love boys.

17:53.319 --> 17:54.354
I can't tell!

17:54.378 --> 17:55.509
Whatever!

17:56.438 --> 17:57.285
So what do you think?

17:57.309 --> 17:58.726
Watch out, it's slippery.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.996
I already told you
what I think.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.497
But you know her.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.795
I know of her, but I don't
"know her" know her.

18:04.847 --> 18:07.009
Okay, you know her friend.
Can you hook us up?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.630
Yo, put that stack
over there.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.340
Um...

18:13.217 --> 18:14.426
Yo, pass me that rice.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.552
Are you listening?

18:15.678 --> 18:16.887
Yeah, I'm listening, man!

18:17.013 --> 18:18.273
All I'm saying is that...

18:18.643 --> 18:21.277
I don't think you should be
putting yourself out there like that.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.226
Especially if you don't
know she like you like that.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.352
She does.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.278
She does?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.740
How do you know she does?

18:36.866 --> 18:38.411
I just know she does.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.038
Hmm. We'll see.

18:46.165 --> 18:47.876
What are you doing?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.503
Thought I felt a drop
of pig shit.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.713
Shut...
Shut the fuck up!

18:52.048 --> 18:54.013
All I know is I've
been trying to get you

18:54.050 --> 18:56.534
to talk to chicks for
the longest in the club.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.090
I don't want to holla
at girls at the club.

18:59.114 --> 19:00.431
Obviously.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.395
So, why are you so
pressed about this one?

19:05.728 --> 19:07.902
I wanted to ask you
something else, too.

19:07.926 --> 19:09.359
What?

19:09.383 --> 19:10.972
I need you to get something for me.

19:11.567 --> 19:17.239
What?

19:17.279 --> 19:19.241
Just for my image.

19:21.576 --> 19:22.828
What?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.121
You trying to strap, yo?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.207
Oh, my God, yo!

19:27.291 --> 19:28.375
What are you going through?

19:28.459 --> 19:29.626
By next Friday, please.

19:29.752 --> 19:30.794
Next Friday?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.420
- Please.
- All right.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.964
Okay, whatever.
I mean...

19:34.090 --> 19:36.299
Oh, my God, yo!

19:36.425 --> 19:37.968
She better be cute
for this, yo.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.929
That's all I know,
she better be cute.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.682
I think it looks natural.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.686
I'm serious, I mean,
it doesn't look that bad.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.062
I can't believe you.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.230
What?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.649
Laura, this looks stupid!
It doesn't look right!

19:52.775 --> 19:54.025
Well, first of all,
it's not supposed

19:54.110 --> 19:55.944
to be over your
underwear like that.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.404
I'm not putting this thing
next to my skin.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.614
It already pinches!
It's supposed to fit like that.

19:59.866 --> 20:00.949
They didn't have brown?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.325
I didn't have time for all of that!

20:02.410 --> 20:04.202
And plus the brown ones
are too big for you anyway.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.412
It's not funny!

20:05.496 --> 20:06.663
Here, you gotta take it back.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.956
I can't take it back.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.291
No, here's the receipt!

20:09.375 --> 20:10.458
Yo, I'm not going back in there.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.252
One time was
embarrassing enough. No.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.461
You grown!
So what?

20:13.546 --> 20:16.339
What if someone see me in
there? No, I'm not going back!

20:16.424 --> 20:18.258
Then where's my change?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.759
Lee, where'd you put my makeup.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.511
Ooh, I'm telling.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.680
Hey! Hey, get off of me!

20:23.764 --> 20:25.390
Stop! Stop!

20:25.474 --> 20:27.100
Get off of me
with that thing, geez!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.268
Be quiet!
Okay. Be quiet!

20:28.394 --> 20:29.686
- I'm telling you got that!
- You can't tell.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.271
- I'm telling!
- Shut up!

20:31.355 --> 20:32.480
Gosh, it looks nasty!

20:32.565 --> 20:33.648
See, I told you so!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.567
Yeah, whatever. Where's my
makeup case? I know you've got it.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.818
I just borrowed it.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.904
Okay, well, give it back!

20:39.447 --> 20:40.655
Take it.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.990
Promise you won't tell.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.158
Just give it back!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.326
Promise you won't tell.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.077
All right!
All right, all right, all right.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.495
All right, I won't tell. Okay?

20:50.291 --> 20:51.374
Geez.

20:53.876 --> 20:54.792
I'm still telling.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.187
Telling what?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.469
She took my makeup again!

20:57.673 --> 20:59.382
Lee, please stop with the...

20:59.467 --> 21:00.310
Oh, hello, Laura.

21:00.501 --> 21:02.191
I didn't see you
standing over there.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.487
Hello, Mrs. Freeman.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.007
How's your mother?

21:05.031 --> 21:06.605
I haven't spoken to her in a while.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.642
She's fine.

21:08.726 --> 21:09.809
I hope so.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.103
And I was glad to hear that your
sister finally got back on her feet.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.688
- Mom! Mom!
- She's good, she's good.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.687
No, I don't think so.

21:24.711 --> 21:26.269
We leave this door open.

21:26.293 --> 21:28.165
Let a little fresh air
circulate in here.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.706
I was just about to leave anyway,
so...

21:31.791 --> 21:33.124
Mom?

21:35.503 --> 21:36.753
Just try it.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.822
Chill, you just got to get used to it.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.595
Stop touching it like that.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.846
People gonna think
you got something.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.598
The string hurts.
I'm going to take it off.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.266
- You're not going to take it off.
- I'm going to take it off.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.851
- Where you gonna take it
off at? - In the bathroom.

21:51.936 --> 21:52.978
Then where are
you going to put it?

21:53.062 --> 21:54.771
You going to walk around the
club with a dick in your hand?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.606
I mean, chill, man, you're
straight blowing me right now, yo.

21:56.691 --> 21:57.774
- Then I'm out.
- No, you're not!

21:57.858 --> 21:58.942
You're about to
go through with this.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.151
You're the one that wanted
to meet her, not me.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.319
Okay, then come on then,
let's go.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.821
All right, man, chill.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.280
Hey.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.574
Where are my AGs at?
Where are my butches at?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.493
Throw your hands in
the air. Let's get it.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.256
You all right?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.718
Yeah, um, I think there's a spring
in the cushion or something.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.180
You wanna switch seats?

22:29.265 --> 22:30.765
Nah, I'm good.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.769
And you don't wanna dance?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.272
Hey, yo, we gonna go dance,
a'ight?

22:38.733 --> 22:40.316
Nah, I'm not really feeling the music.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.656
Well, look, you don't mind, right,

22:46.741 --> 22:48.283
if I go dance
with somebody else?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.076
Nah, do your thing.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.538
If you change your mind, we...

22:53.622 --> 22:55.373
Nah, it's cool.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.860
Turn that mess off!

24:06.362 --> 24:07.821
Sharonda!

24:07.905 --> 24:10.031
Sharonda, stop lollygagging!

24:10.658 --> 24:12.742
Lee! Are you ready?

24:12.827 --> 24:13.910
Yup.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.456
I said off.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.835
And I thought you said
you were ready?

24:21.919 --> 24:23.002
I am ready.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.615
You're not going
to church in that!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.007
What's wrong with this?

24:26.215 --> 24:27.632
Where's that blouse I bought you?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.175
What's wrong with this?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.469
Dad!

24:31.554 --> 24:32.846
Do what your mom says.

24:33.139 --> 24:33.952
Are you hungry?

24:34.193 --> 24:35.620
Here, let me heat this up for you.

24:35.644 --> 24:36.474
- That's okay. - Oh, it tastes
so much better.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.642
- Just leave it.
- Dad...

24:37.726 --> 24:39.477
- Lee!
- Leave me out of it.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.645
Now go get changed.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.230
Dad, what's wrong
with this outfit?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.398
- Nothing.
- See.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.649
I'm not going to
argue with you.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.234
- Do what she says.
- Dad!

24:47.695 --> 24:49.362
And put on a skirt!

24:52.615 --> 24:54.159
Give me a beer, please.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.493
It's Sunday morning.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.829
It goes with the spaghetti.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.163
Too much lip gloss.

25:11.926 --> 25:13.594
Did you talk to her?

25:13.646 --> 25:15.263
Sharonda's fine.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.265
- I'm talking about Lee.
- Alike.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.683
And I don't see that
there's a problem.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.103
I'm tired of this whole
tomboy thing she's been doing.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.271
And Laura.

25:23.938 --> 25:25.523
You said that you were
going to handle it.

25:25.608 --> 25:26.691
Mmm-hmm.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.776
She needs
a male point of view!

25:28.861 --> 25:30.904
I said okay, damn it.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.315
Do you have to work tonight?

25:36.367 --> 25:39.913
To put food on the table
and clothes on our backs, no.

25:39.997 --> 25:43.583
To go out to restaurants and keep
designer sneakers in the closet, yes.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.251
Are you forever gonna be mad?

25:45.753 --> 25:48.004
Are you forever gonna be happy?

25:48.505 --> 25:51.090
You made that decision
a long time ago.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.135
We both made sacrifices.

25:57.972 --> 25:59.974
You look beautiful, baby.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.392
Tuck your blouse in.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.311
- This isn't me.
- Tuck it in.

26:03.437 --> 26:04.938
Leave it out.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.440
I think it's fine out.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.487
Are you coming with us?

26:12.539 --> 26:14.113
Nope. Sleep.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.157
We could do a later service.
Maybe the one o'clock.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.117
- I said no!
- I'm ready!

26:18.661 --> 26:20.495
Sharonda, Alike, you look beautiful.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.956
Everybody looks beautiful, okay?

26:34.468 --> 26:35.510
Well, fine then.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.387
- Stop hitting me.
- Put this one in then.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.972
- "God's love"? I don't think so.
- Put it in.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.139
- Stop!
- Put in that one.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.225
- Audrey, hey!
- Hi!

26:42.351 --> 26:44.060
- How're you doing, girl?
- All right.

26:46.397 --> 26:47.563
- I'm not touching you.
- Stop!

26:47.690 --> 26:49.899
I'm not touching you!
Sharonda, stop!

26:50.025 --> 26:51.067
Ouch!

26:51.193 --> 26:53.319
- Lee, there's somebody I want
you to meet. - That's just mean.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.697
Huh? Here's somebody
I want you to meet.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.282
Oh, hi.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.618
Get down out of the car
and come speak!

27:04.123 --> 27:05.707
- What's wrong with you?
- All right, Mom.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.375
You'll have to excuse my daughter.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.835
She's been feeling rude lately.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.378
Oh, don't worry about it.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.994
I understand how it is.

27:12.046 --> 27:14.799
Hormones, you know.
It's just a phase.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.594
Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary,
one of my coworkers,

27:18.721 --> 27:20.054
and her daughter Bina.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.306
Hi.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.642
And that's my youngest
daughter Sharonda.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.894
- Hey.
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.808
Lee, Bina goes to your school.

27:31.539 --> 27:32.485
Cool.

27:32.509 --> 27:35.820
Yeah, I think I've seen you around,
um, Mrs. Alvarado's class?

27:35.904 --> 27:37.322
AP English?

27:37.406 --> 27:38.573
Yup.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.659
Well, now that we're all
acquainted with one another,

27:41.744 --> 27:42.827
let's not be strangers.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.330
Oh, no, no, we won't.
Right, honey?

27:46.457 --> 27:48.949
Bina, I think you two even go
to school the same way.

27:49.001 --> 27:49.941
Oh! Well, you know,

27:49.964 --> 27:52.378
there's something to be said
about safety in numbers, right?

27:52.463 --> 27:53.755
- Yup.
- Yeah.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.675
Well, you know,
we need to be pushing off.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.719
I'll call you about
the VBS workbooks.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.387
- All righty. - All righty.
- Take care. - All right?

28:01.472 --> 28:02.930
Great. Come on, honey. Bye!

28:03.015 --> 28:04.223
So, where you wanna go?

28:04.308 --> 28:05.641
Um, I want to get those pancakes.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.856
Oops.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.399
You're funny.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.526
I don't know
what your problem is.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.736
Mom, can you put this in please?

28:16.820 --> 28:18.905
I don't know what you think
this is going to change.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.616
I know God doesn't make mistakes.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.702
I know that.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.622
Now, you may not like Bina,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.656
but you're going to be spending
a whole lot less time

28:29.680 --> 28:30.666
with that Laura
person.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.293
- Mom, can you just put this
in? - I can guarantee you that.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.087
No, shh, be quiet,
I'm not putting anything in.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.547
I'm going to listen to what I want
to listen to for a change.

28:41.552 --> 28:43.304
Look, I just don't like lying
to my mother, that's all.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.181
So then don't,
she doesn't have to know.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.308
Yes, she does.
She asks me every day!

28:47.393 --> 28:48.893
So, then, tell her yeah.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.104
No! I don't want to lie
just to cover for you.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.438
So don't!

28:52.523 --> 28:56.651
Look, Alike, or Lee or whatever
it is you want to be called,

28:56.735 --> 28:59.036
I'm really not trying to hang
out with you either, okay,

28:59.060 --> 29:00.767
but I'm not about
to take an L for it.

29:00.791 --> 29:01.866
So just stop dodging me!

29:01.890 --> 29:03.291
Let's just go to school
together and then...

29:03.325 --> 29:05.896
Then it's over with, we don't have to
hang out with each other after that.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.716
You know what, whatever!

29:07.740 --> 29:08.996
She asks me again
I'm gonna tell her,

29:09.081 --> 29:10.164
and then she's gonna
tell your mother,

29:10.249 --> 29:12.291
and then it's whatever for you.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.920
Hey!
Hey, look, I'm sorry!

29:18.549 --> 29:20.133
Look, I'm sorry!

29:22.386 --> 29:24.429
Hello, I said I'm sorry!

29:24.763 --> 29:26.848
Yeah, you sorry your
mother's about to bug out.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.183
No, for real, I'm sorry.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.145
I didn't mean to be
that way, it's just...

29:33.105 --> 29:35.606
Okay, look, I am concerned
my mom will find out,

29:35.691 --> 29:37.400
- but it's...
- But...

29:37.818 --> 29:39.777
It's not like that,
it's just that she's...

29:40.487 --> 29:42.029
Look, if you knew my mother,
you'd understand.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.614
- She's...
- Overprotective?

29:44.992 --> 29:46.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know, I've seen her.

29:46.869 --> 29:50.872
I see what she's like, but lots
of people's parents are like that.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.415
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.501
Yeah, but not like mine.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.962
- Anyway... - Anyway, like
I said, let's just walk.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.968
Thank you so much
for bringing that.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.428
No problem.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.221
You done studying yet?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.681
No.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.224
Did you start studying yet?

30:10.726 --> 30:13.895
I'm on chapter nine.
Now, stop.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.285
Get them fucking cards
out of here.

30:18.309 --> 30:19.841
No, we gonna study these words.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.152
- I ain't studying.
- We can play 'em like Tonk.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.154
We can play Spades with
these vocabulary cards.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.097
Get outta here, yo.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.079
I'm about to deal you in.
I'm gonna deal you in.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.700
So, listen, I'm gonna work
some more hours so we could...

30:27.784 --> 30:29.994
"Listless, apathetic, having no
interest in anything." That's yours.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.412
Listen! I have a job.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.247
I'll work some more hours.
I don't need school.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.479
"Clandestine, secret,
hidden, undercover." Not you.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.878
Annoying, you annoying me.
Like, really.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.671
- "Turbulent, violently disturbed...
- Come on, yo.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.508
"... agitated, unruly."
That's yours.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.777
Anyway, how much
we paid him last time?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.234
Six twenty-five.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.809
So, that's another 275
for the rest of the month.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.937
Electric?

30:55.979 --> 30:57.146
Half.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.106
Phone?

30:59.566 --> 31:01.025
Let it ride.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.057
Gas?

31:02.109 --> 31:03.736
How much is it?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.238
Eighty-five.

31:05.739 --> 31:06.906
Half.

31:07.281 --> 31:08.783
No, mmm-mmm.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.160
Let it ride.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.788
I could get some more hours.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.997
No.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.751
You know what you need to do.

31:18.775 --> 31:21.187
Nah, Candy, I can't just dip
out on you like that, man.

31:21.211 --> 31:23.672
Please, I was doing just fine
before you moved in, remember?

31:24.258 --> 31:26.604
You working was only
supposed to be temporary.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.020
Remember that?

31:28.044 --> 31:29.878
I'm only gonna work
for a little bit.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.140
- Ma would've wanted you
to be done with... - Who?

31:33.267 --> 31:34.350
Who?

31:35.102 --> 31:36.978
Yo, don't even...
Just... Just stop.

31:37.104 --> 31:38.354
Mom would have wanted
you to be done by now.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.981
Look, I'll get the money
orders in the morning.

31:42.276 --> 31:43.943
I'll look into it.

31:48.699 --> 31:50.116
The next test is coming up soon.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.159
I said I'll look into it.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.413
Without them and
their courageous efforts,

31:55.465 --> 31:57.331
we wouldn't have been
able to pull this off.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.335
Look, it's on again.
Check it out, Free.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.838
Channel Five
and Channel Two.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.705
Look who's big time.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.916
Oh, yeah, but my brother
looked clean though.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.529
Yeah, you look like, you
look like, uh, that guy on TV.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.682
Oh, yeah...

32:20.355 --> 32:22.680
There's been more of that since
they opened up that new club

32:22.692 --> 32:24.301
'cross the way.

32:24.325 --> 32:25.693
Excuse me, Miss?

32:26.361 --> 32:27.445
Miss?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.822
On certain Fridays they
got this, you know...

32:29.948 --> 32:31.949
- ... special party going on.
- Miss?

32:33.201 --> 32:35.036
Or should I say, "Sir"?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.371
Sir?
Sir?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.207
- Hello?
- Chill out, Sock.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.126
Hey, my man,
you hear me talking to you?

32:42.419 --> 32:43.492
Hey.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.963
- Mind your business.
- Hey!

32:47.215 --> 32:48.633
And a pack of Kool.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.260
Say, I've been trying
to get your attention.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.928
Do you go by sir or miss?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.796
- Will that be all, ma'am?
- Yeah.

32:55.848 --> 32:59.101
Look, I just had a simple
question I wanted to ask.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.561
$67.05.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.765
See, I just wanna know,
how does pussy taste?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.839
You know, I just want to know
if you go with women for the taste

33:09.821 --> 33:13.157
or is it because you too dry,
crusty, and ugly,

33:13.742 --> 33:15.816
so don't no man want you?

33:19.998 --> 33:23.145
I can't lie.
The pussy do taste good.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.002
Oh, yeah?

33:25.337 --> 33:27.004
Maybe you should try it sometime.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.508
Or better yet, ask your wife
how much she like me.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.010
Fuckin' bulldagger!

33:33.553 --> 33:35.096
- He-she dyke!
- Yeah.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.557
Hey, ask yo' wife!

33:38.684 --> 33:39.809
She told you.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.769
She ain't tell me shit!

33:42.437 --> 33:44.355
What the fuck y'all
niggas are laughing for!

33:44.439 --> 33:45.648
Oh, shut up, man!

33:45.732 --> 33:48.025
Your big mouth got you
in trouble as usual.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.443
Thought you was my friend, Mack.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.778
Oh, man!

33:51.530 --> 33:54.031
But I guess I didn't expect you
to defend me, Free.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.325
- Way your daughter's running
around here bull-dyke. - Say what?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.786

34:00.580 --> 34:02.957
What? He don't know what
he talking about, man.

34:03.009 --> 34:05.334
He ain't moved outside
of a two mile radius

34:05.419 --> 34:07.670
of where he crawled
out his mama's pussy.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.422

34:09.505 --> 34:11.590
Yeah, well, get your

Man, fuck y'all!

34:17.389 --> 34:19.223

34:19.639 --> 34:23.226
Don't pay him no mind.
He just talking trash.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.692

34:29.775 --> 34:32.235
Yes, you was.
Yo, Candy, I'm home yo.

You coulda called a nigga.

34:48.590 --> 34:51.147
My bad, she's got me hanging out

34:51.170 --> 34:52.790

- Well, is she making you?

34:52.975 --> 34:54.831
I mean, you a grown-ass woman, bruh!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.857
Uh... I don't know

35:10.567 --> 35:12.651
That's hot, yo,
you should rock that.

35:13.904 --> 35:15.941
I was thinking maybe we
could do something different.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.908
Different like what?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.452
I don't know.
Like, maybe...

35:21.536 --> 35:23.204
check out an open mic or something.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.207
Open mic? Nah, man, there's
plenty of chicks at the piers.

35:26.259 --> 35:28.626
You just gotta be more confident.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.463
I mean I haven't even wore
this, you could rock that.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.298
If you want.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.127
But I understand if you
got better things to do.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.587
No. I'm down.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.723
- I don't want you getting all
hemmed up. - No, seriously.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.183
I'm down for whatever.

35:45.894 --> 35:46.977
Real?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.312
Promise.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.815
A'ight.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.818
I'ma take Saturday
off at work,

35:53.985 --> 35:55.861
it's going to be on and
poppin', you feel me?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.738
It's gonna be mad tight.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.075
We goin' get that punani, yo.
Feel me?

36:01.660 --> 36:05.204
- They look fake.
- No, I think they're happy.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.415
Now, that looks fake.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.693
You should wear your hair
down more often.

36:14.756 --> 36:15.923
Your father likes it up.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.885
It looks nice down.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.763
Maybe.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.598
Give this back
to Bina's mom

36:24.683 --> 36:26.392
when you go over there
tomorrow night.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.602
Saturday night?

36:28.728 --> 36:31.021
- We talked about this.
- No, we didn't!

36:31.231 --> 36:33.774
- Lee.
- I had plans this weekend!

36:34.109 --> 36:35.776
Well, you don't have
to go to Bina's.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.279
You can stay here with
me on Saturday night.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.114
God!

36:42.991 --> 36:44.410
Come on.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.584
So you like Destiny's Kids?

36:48.706 --> 36:50.082
Mmm-mmm.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.750
JP?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.117
Nope.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.420
What about Fiddy?

36:54.962 --> 36:57.965
No, I don't like any
of that commercial bullshit.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.675
Okay, so who do you like?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.428
Just some underground stuff.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.513
None of that crap
they play on the radio.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.349
Okay, like who?

37:09.978 --> 37:11.855
You know, people you
probably never heard of.

37:11.879 --> 37:13.049
Conscious stuff.

37:13.073 --> 37:14.415
Okay, like who?

37:14.691 --> 37:18.763
Like Trees, Black Circle, Far Front.

37:18.787 --> 37:21.030
Far Front?
Girl, I know Far Front.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.198
- Really?
- Yeah!

37:24.117 --> 37:27.953
What about, um,
Trade, or BRawls?

37:28.330 --> 37:30.831
Or what about, um, Mama Dobia?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.501
Uh-oh. What do you know
about Mama Bodia?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.045
Let me find out.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.172
See.
You don't even know me.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.426
Oh, hi, Audrey.
Yes, she's here.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.511
Yeah, yeah.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.639
No, no, I understand.

37:47.097 --> 37:48.349
Sure.

37:48.891 --> 37:50.517
Not a problem.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.148
- What about rock?
- It's cool.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.692
All right, I'm out.
Wait, oh, hey, wait, hey.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.819
You gotta check this out.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.260
Wow.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.730
Hello!

38:37.315 --> 38:39.233
Hey. You look nice.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.487
Oh, um, is Lee home?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.526
No, she's not.
She's out with a friend.

38:45.723 --> 38:46.566
Oh, do you know what time
she'll be back?

38:46.567 --> 38:47.354
She won't be back.

38:47.406 --> 38:48.909
She's out with a friend
the entire evening.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.828
- Oh, 'cause, we was gonna...
- You take care.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.454
Goodnight.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.167
The love is gone
but the memory lingers...

38:58.586 --> 39:00.421
Yo, this shit is hot.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.924
Oh, don't you gotta go?

39:04.509 --> 39:06.260
It's cool, I'll...
I'll cover for you.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.005
Nah, I wanna stay.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.854
Hey, this is Lee, I'm not able
to take your call.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.606
Please leave a message at
the sound of the tone. Peace.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.775
Hey, yo, where you at, Lee?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.987
Yo, hit me up when you get here,
a'ight?

39:25.113 --> 39:26.280
A'ight?

39:31.661 --> 39:34.163
- Come on, man, let's go, man.
- A'ight, yo.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.123
- What happened? - She didn't
fucking show up, man.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.992
Well, you stressing
that shit too much.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.093
Uh, Mrs. Alvarado's trying to get
me to check out one of these places.

40:16.122 --> 40:19.333
Oh, hell, no.
This is for old people.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.669
You know what, I'll write
down some places for you.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.433
And maybe you can read
some of my stuff, too?

40:26.591 --> 40:27.981
Definitely.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.654
Yo, y'all remember when
we used to come out here

40:50.913 --> 40:52.074
all night?

40:52.098 --> 40:53.789
Shit, used to.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.162
You staying with your sister now, huh?

40:57.247 --> 40:58.413
Yeah.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.916
- Lucky as hell, man.
- Think?

41:26.151 --> 41:29.069
My sister be home by six,
so, you gotta be out by then.

41:29.362 --> 41:30.850
A'ight, good-looking.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.907
Yeah, there's some lunch meat
in the fridge if you want some.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.702
- I appreciate you.
- Yeah.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.333
Okay, easy, easy.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.523
Watch the right hand side,
watch the right.

42:26.547 --> 42:27.419
I am!

42:28.463 --> 42:30.047
Okay.
Oh, careful of the curb!

42:30.131 --> 42:32.090
All right.
Okay.

42:32.467 --> 42:33.800
Good, good.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.346
See.

42:37.596 --> 42:38.637
I did it.

42:39.028 --> 42:41.078
Can I drive back home?
Please?

42:41.102 --> 42:42.514
Uh, I don't know
about all that girl.

42:42.566 --> 42:43.926
- You're shaky. You're shaky.
- Please?

42:43.950 --> 42:45.771
Here, here, get us some chips
and we'll think about it.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.357
- Come...
- Give me some time to consider.

42:52.654 --> 42:53.862
Careful.

42:57.991 --> 42:59.282
Hey, Mack!

43:00.203 --> 43:01.328
- Hey there.
- Hey, Mr. Ferguson.

43:01.454 --> 43:02.788
- How you doing?
- I'm good, how you doing?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.332
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Thanks.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.669
Yeah, I see where Alike been
running you around again, huh?

43:08.795 --> 43:09.836
Oh, little bit, little bit,

43:09.963 --> 43:11.088
but you know, I still got it, though.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.965
Yeah, I remember that
crossover you used to have.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.091
You got to come out
there with us

43:14.175 --> 43:17.302
so I can show her
what it's like in the fifties.

43:22.350 --> 43:23.850
Get in the car.

43:24.185 --> 43:27.562
Wait, I'm driving! You said
I could... Get in the car.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.124
Look, um...

43:48.041 --> 43:50.711
You know you're daddy's girl, right?

43:59.053 --> 44:01.305
"A butterfly, briefly suffocated

44:01.389 --> 44:03.473
"on the mucus of its own change,

44:03.558 --> 44:05.851
"imprisoned by the
membranous chaff

44:05.935 --> 44:08.228
"of its own
underdeveloped wings

44:08.563 --> 44:10.147
"and cramped in the darkness

44:10.231 --> 44:13.150
"of the too tight cocoon
of its own creation,

44:13.568 --> 44:16.320
"pauses, thinking death inevitable,

44:16.654 --> 44:20.157
"prepares to die in the absolute
solitude of swollen husk.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.743
"A crack appears,

44:23.411 --> 44:26.788
"a thin, jagged light connecting
the inner to the outer world,

44:27.582 --> 44:31.293
"a butterfly, briefly paralyzed
by the imminence of death,

44:32.170 --> 44:34.421
"discovers life is possible."

44:36.923 --> 44:38.884
Comments? Critiques?

44:38.968 --> 44:40.924
Julie, tell me what you think.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.058
I like how
she described the butterfly.

44:43.430 --> 44:44.639
I could almost see her...

44:46.768 --> 44:48.685
I liked your story though.
It was tight.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.062
Yeah, which one?
The one about the...

44:50.146 --> 44:52.439
Karma. About how
things come back to you.

44:52.774 --> 44:53.815
That one, it was tight.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.818
- For real? - Yeah.
- Thanks.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.213
I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

44:59.447 --> 45:00.792
I liked yours, too.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.094
Why?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.652
Why wasn't
I gonna say anything,

45:03.676 --> 45:05.702
- or why did I like it?
- No, why did you like it?

45:05.787 --> 45:08.789
I don't know, it just...
It felt real.

45:11.376 --> 45:12.709
Okay.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.046
Didn't you have
a different shirt on earlier?

45:16.130 --> 45:17.255
What?

45:17.340 --> 45:18.673
Nothin'.

45:19.008 --> 45:21.635
- No, say what you're gonna say.
- Nothin'.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.133
Yeah, I had on a different shirt.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.746
That's cool.

45:30.812 --> 45:32.995
So how come you weren't going
to say anything about it?

45:33.189 --> 45:35.148
- About your shirt?
- About the poem.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.984
- 'Cause you're moody.
- Moody?

45:38.008 --> 45:40.126
- And quiet.
- I'm not moody!

45:40.150 --> 45:41.516
Yeah, right!

45:45.576 --> 45:47.524
- What?
- This is me.

45:47.829 --> 45:50.444
Hey, it's not so bad when
there's a little conversation!

45:51.165 --> 45:52.740
You wanna come up?

46:09.392 --> 46:10.628
Who gave you this?

46:11.018 --> 46:13.546
- The bear? My dad.
- No, this.

46:15.648 --> 46:17.970
Girl, my stupid
ex-boyfriend gave me that.

46:17.994 --> 46:19.540
Oh, cute.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.883
Not really. But I guess
it was at the time.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.130
So this is the artist
I was telling you about.

46:28.227 --> 46:30.695
Her stuff is like...
I don't know, dense.

46:32.563 --> 46:34.742
Yeah, this is straight.
You burn me a copy?

46:34.766 --> 46:35.876
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Good. Thanks.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.295
I got some other stuff
for you, too.

46:38.379 --> 46:39.546
Cool.

46:42.717 --> 46:43.717
So who do you hang out with?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.939
'Cause I never really see you
with anybody.

46:50.557 --> 46:52.434
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for it to come out like that.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.810
I was just curious 'cause...

46:54.186 --> 46:55.770
I don't really like anybody
that goes there either.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.065
No, my, my friend Laura
used to go there.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.366
Not now, but she's coming back.

47:01.612 --> 47:02.569
Cool.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.750
'Cause I was gonna say,
I'm going to this house party

47:04.774 --> 47:06.740
and, you know, you can come
if you want to.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.658
They play like this kind of music.

47:12.413 --> 47:13.580
Sure.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.665
How am I supposed to dress?

47:15.750 --> 47:18.043
You don't gotta dress.
You just come however.

47:18.127 --> 47:19.961
Come as you are.

47:20.421 --> 47:21.588
Okay.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.342
Can I see?

47:26.260 --> 47:28.951
It's... it's mostly old stuff,
though.

47:30.014 --> 47:32.807
Oh, this is the one
that you did earlier.

47:32.892 --> 47:34.142
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.020
It's nice.

47:43.277 --> 47:44.319
Here you go.

47:46.656 --> 47:49.074
- Take it.
- You play too much!

47:49.158 --> 47:51.451
- Just take it.
- Thank you.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.370
You're welcome.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.874
So, what's so private?

47:58.125 --> 48:00.335
Nothing. It's just my writings.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.069
Why'd you do that for?

48:26.487 --> 48:27.904
I'm sorry.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.407
- I thought...
- No, I'm sorry,

48:31.492 --> 48:33.076
I just gotta go.

48:34.579 --> 48:36.079
But I thought that...

48:36.247 --> 48:37.581
I'm sorry.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.250
We gonna get y'all on the board,
God damn it!

48:40.585 --> 48:41.668
Okay.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.670
Let's play, keep it rolling,
keep it rolling!

48:43.754 --> 48:45.391
Ain't giving you
no stupid-ass hand.

48:45.619 --> 48:46.916
You gonna get that?

48:46.940 --> 48:48.508
- Yeah, I got it. There you go.
- Cut that!

48:50.678 --> 48:52.178
Come on, bring it out. Bring it out.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.513
Ooh!

48:53.889 --> 48:55.724
We went in
the hole one time.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.434
Y'all went in the hole twice!
Yo, wassup.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.437
Yo, whaddup, Lee!
Yo, what you got, Ty?

49:00.688 --> 49:02.188
Pick 'em up! Nasty!

49:05.443 --> 49:08.194
Oh! We goin' to eight!
We goin' to eight!

49:09.530 --> 49:10.905
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

49:11.032 --> 49:13.158
Yo, I'm busy right now.
I'm doing something.

49:13.784 --> 49:17.120
Holdup, holdup!
That was my jack! I cut! I cut!

49:18.789 --> 49:20.624
Laura, I really need to talk to you.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.626
- Laura, I really need...
- Yo, man.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.836
I told you I'm fucking busy! Shit!

49:25.963 --> 49:28.715
Nah. Nah, nah.
I'm busy.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.556
- Goodnight.
- Get home safe!

49:36.682 --> 49:38.808
Yo... I thought that was your girl.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.518
- Mind yo business!
- I'm her girl!

49:40.603 --> 49:42.187
Exactly. Exactly.
This will...

49:42.355 --> 49:45.523
You go ahead. That's
what I'm talking about.

49:45.608 --> 49:46.733
Y'all niggas don't know.

49:47.318 --> 49:50.070
You know, boo.
Get the fuck outta here, yo!

50:04.377 --> 50:05.460
Dad!

50:11.133 --> 50:13.259
Come on, now, you know
that's not what I want.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.109
That's not what I'm saying!

50:16.972 --> 50:18.118
Lis... Listen to me.

50:18.919 --> 50:20.307
Are you going to listen to me?

50:20.331 --> 50:21.629
Dad?

50:22.853 --> 50:24.347
Listen, I gotta go.

50:24.647 --> 50:27.411
I gotta go, my daughter's...
My daughter's up!

50:27.525 --> 50:29.275
- Dad?
- Talk to you later, bye.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.112
- Who was that?
- What you doing up?

50:33.197 --> 50:34.948
Just wanted to talk.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.384
Dad, the plate!

50:43.082 --> 50:44.540
Don't trash the plate.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.877
- Aren't you hungry?
- No.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.505
- Ate already.
- You ate at work?

50:50.881 --> 50:52.882
- Grabbed some takeout.
- Oh, where?

50:54.051 --> 50:55.593
Why you asking me so many
goddamn questions, girl?

50:55.678 --> 50:57.721
What's wrong with you?
You don't question me.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.682
Sorry.

51:02.268 --> 51:03.643
Hold up, Alike.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.021
Come on back. Look.

51:07.148 --> 51:08.356
I got patties.

51:10.818 --> 51:12.819
- Beef?
- And chicken. Come on.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.203
Listen, um...

51:23.247 --> 51:25.114
Your mom was worried
that uh...

51:31.172 --> 51:33.406
She's been wanting me
to ask you...

51:34.049 --> 51:35.425
that, uh...

51:38.679 --> 51:40.263
How's school?

51:40.431 --> 51:41.931
Straight As?

51:43.559 --> 51:44.642
Probably.

51:44.809 --> 51:47.437
That's right.
Wanna sip?

51:51.358 --> 51:53.109
I said a sip! A sip!

52:00.034 --> 52:01.075
What's on your mind?

52:02.870 --> 52:04.120
Nothin'.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.460
What if...

52:11.545 --> 52:15.256
What if say...
somebody liked you?

52:15.800 --> 52:17.926
They like you?
Or they "like you" like you?

52:18.052 --> 52:19.719
They "like you"
like you.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.137
Uh-huh.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.724
They haven't said anything yet but...

52:24.809 --> 52:27.644
But what if...
All right, what if the person

52:27.937 --> 52:29.896
is kind of
like a friend,

52:30.147 --> 52:31.856
but you know they like
you more than that?

52:32.274 --> 52:34.984
Well, I think that's the
best way, to start as friends.

52:38.155 --> 52:41.324
What if...
What if the person is...

52:43.369 --> 52:44.994
- What if the person...
- What's his name?

52:45.079 --> 52:47.622
What grade is he in? I'm gonna
look his ass up in the system.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.375
Wait till I tell your mama.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.001
She'll be so goddamn happy.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.089
Yeah.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.471
Say, uh...

53:04.098 --> 53:07.141
There's this new, uh, women's club

53:08.018 --> 53:10.228
up there by the liquor store.

53:11.730 --> 53:12.814
Do you...

53:13.774 --> 53:17.132
Have you... You haven't heard
anything about it, right?

53:17.987 --> 53:21.819
Called the Kitty Litter,
Cat Box, something like that?

53:23.033 --> 53:25.201
Nah, never even heard of it.

53:25.995 --> 53:27.036
Good.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.746
'Cause it's a...

53:29.498 --> 53:31.332
that's a rough neighborhood.

53:31.542 --> 53:33.626
You know that, right?
I had a case over there.

53:34.420 --> 53:36.212
You wanna be careful.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.172
Stay away from that element.

53:38.299 --> 53:40.300
In case it ever comes up.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.302
I'll be careful.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.469
Good.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.471
I know you will.

53:49.727 --> 53:51.268
Dad, when you were
on the phone earlier...

53:51.562 --> 53:53.062
- Uh-huh.
- It sounded like...

53:54.940 --> 53:56.024
I mean...

53:56.901 --> 53:59.068
I guess you're headed
back to work, huh?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.320
Yup.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.073
- Your mama still up?
- Probably.

54:05.576 --> 54:06.910
Tell her I had to work.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.623
Love you.

54:40.736 --> 54:42.028
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.616
I'm real sorry about
the other day.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.454
- It's cool.
- Things have been crazy.

54:52.456 --> 54:54.745
But look,
I'm really sorry I bugged out.

54:54.769 --> 54:58.139
It's just, I didn't know that
you... I wasn't expecting that.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.507
First kiss?

55:02.675 --> 55:04.008
It's cool.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.470
You still comin' at the party?

55:07.554 --> 55:11.218
Um... I don't know. I need
to try to catch up with Laura.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.393
Oh, okay.

55:13.560 --> 55:17.230
No, but I do wanna hang, but
I mean, maybe we could do both.

55:17.398 --> 55:18.564
Cool.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.069
Uh, do you want to
spend the night?

55:24.530 --> 55:27.258
You know, maybe avoid
that whole curfew thing?

56:10.117 --> 56:11.405
Oh, you're home?

56:13.037 --> 56:14.120
Hey.

56:15.622 --> 56:17.540
I must have dozed off.

56:18.292 --> 56:20.293
- How long you been in?
- Hour.

56:22.421 --> 56:23.796
Did you see the plate over there?

56:24.548 --> 56:25.965
This is fine.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.698
Why don't you come sit
over here? There's room.

56:30.722 --> 56:33.139
- You could see the TV better.
- This is fine.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.224
Thank you.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.061
Just alike.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.479
Say what?

56:39.646 --> 56:42.774
You and your daughter.
Did you talk to Lee yet?

56:43.233 --> 56:46.110
- I told you she's still...
- I talked to Alike.

56:46.945 --> 56:48.154
You did?

56:48.280 --> 56:50.656
Everything's fine,
like I told you.

56:50.949 --> 56:53.522
Matter of fact,
she's got a boyfriend.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.032
A boyfriend?

56:55.060 --> 56:56.833
Just give her some space.

56:57.122 --> 56:58.247
Space?

56:59.249 --> 57:02.085
She's never around as it is.
And you're just like her!

57:02.628 --> 57:04.170
Creeping in all hours
of the night.

57:04.296 --> 57:06.346
Running around like you
got something to hide.

57:06.370 --> 57:07.393
Both of you!

57:07.417 --> 57:09.681
And acting like
I'm the big bad witch!

57:09.843 --> 57:11.312
What about me, huh?

57:11.336 --> 57:13.374
I'm here alone by myself all the time.

57:13.398 --> 57:15.688
And Sharonda's getting older
and she's starting to go out,

57:15.712 --> 57:17.934
and pretty soon... - I don't
have anything to hide.

57:18.519 --> 57:20.978
Look, I told you.
I talked to Alike.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.272
- Everything's fine.
- Did you ask her?

57:23.357 --> 57:25.441
No, because I don't have to.

57:26.650 --> 57:28.694
Besides, I would know, okay?

57:28.821 --> 57:30.738
I know my daughter better than
anyone else. "Your daughter."

57:30.864 --> 57:33.199
- Suddenly she's your daughter?
- And I'm telling you, she's fine.

57:33.251 --> 57:35.535
Well, I guess then I just shouldn't
say anything else about this!

57:35.619 --> 57:37.703
That's your damn problem. You're
too much of a damn worrywart.

57:37.830 --> 57:39.578
Well, let's hope
you're right, detective.

57:39.602 --> 57:41.250
Will you shut the fuck up?

57:42.376 --> 57:44.043
An hour? Really?

57:44.545 --> 57:46.504
I'm not your damn dumb
floozy on the street

57:46.588 --> 57:48.805
and you will not
talk to me like that!

57:49.383 --> 57:51.175
Dammit, Audrey,
you're making a scene!

57:51.385 --> 57:53.094
I'm not making a scene.
You're the one making a scene!

57:53.220 --> 57:55.388
You're all paranoid and sick!
You're never here!

58:09.570 --> 58:11.571
I know you're not scared.

58:12.364 --> 58:13.573
I'm not.

58:20.289 --> 58:21.914
- Lee...
- Hmm?

58:23.625 --> 58:25.905
I hope you know
it doesn't matter to me.

58:30.757 --> 58:31.695
I know.

58:50.402 --> 58:52.403
# And she ran like blood

58:54.072 --> 58:58.409
# Through the corridors
of your mind

58:59.244 --> 59:01.287
# Into a brand new future

59:03.123 --> 59:08.628
# One without the likes of you

59:49.002 --> 59:51.170
You are mad fun to hang
out with, I have to say.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.259
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

59:56.343 --> 59:57.677
Whatever!

59:57.844 --> 59:59.720
I'm just playing. About...
About six months ago.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:04.308
What's good?
What's up?

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.185
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.857
So what do you think?
She's cool, right?

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.361
She's hot, right?
I told you!

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.905
Right? I told you! It was
so... Yo, I'm right here.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:20.700
Oh, my bad!

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:21.951
I thought you were
right beside me.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.995
No. Anyway, I was thinking
next weekend

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:27.186
the three of us, we
could, you know, go out.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.266
I'm sorry about all the drama.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:32.545
- Nah, it's cool. I mean,
I should have... - No.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.755
- You know.
- What I'm saying is...

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.717
I probably overreacted.
I mean...

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:42.171
But then, I don't know, seeing
the two of you together...

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.116
I'm glad you're finally
happy though.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.661
Come on, man, you know
you're my best friend.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.487
I'm not, no one's ever...

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:54.363
You don't have
to say anything, yo.

01:00:54.387 --> 01:00:57.069
I just want to get this
off my chest, all right?

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.572
I'm glad she makes you happy.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.574
I'm happy for you.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.285
A'ight?

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:07.079
'Cause I love you.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.756
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.300
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- So...

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.093
Wait! Laura.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:25.473
- Come on, let's go, I know some...
- Laura!

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.308
What up, boo?

01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:30.102
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:39.612
- I'm not sleeping.
- Yes, you are.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.782
Are there any more brownies left?

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:44.617
Nope.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.626
- What?
- Nothing.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.299
- What?
- Nothing!

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.326
What's wrong?

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.018
This is...

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:57.022
I never...

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.193
I'm sorry, I'm trippin'.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.196
It's okay.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.720
We don't have to.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:05.818
Oh.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.858
I thought you went out
for something.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.051
How you been?

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.701
You know me and Candy
doing real good.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.966
We might even get a bigger place.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.297
She workin' at the hospital now.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.464
You'd be real proud.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.051
She might even get her RN.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.721
How's... How's pops?

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.434
You look good.
You look real good.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.939
You know, we miss you
and everything.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:46.317
I don't, I don't want to
take too much of your time

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.444
or anything like that.
I just...

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:51.155
I got my... I'm getting
my stuff together, too.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.364
You know?

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.491
So I did it.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.369
I got my GED.

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.415
Nah, nah, I did it!
I got my GED!

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.687
- Good morning.
- Hey.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.816
You're up already.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:29.693
Actually, it's after one o'clock.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.784
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:38.661
I'm just trying to clean up,
that's all.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.622
- Okay, let me help you then.
- No, it's all right, I got it.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.709
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.092
Look, um, last night was...

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.775
It was amazing, and thank you.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.364
Last night was just playing around,
all right?

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.063
Look, we can slow things down.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.190
People don't have to know
that we're together.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.485
Together? Whoa.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:13.987
No, uh-uh.

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:17.883
Look, if you don't want to
call it that, that's fine,

01:07:17.907 --> 01:07:19.752
but don't act
like nothing happened.

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:22.138
I'm not like "gay" gay,
I'm just...

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.425
I'm just...

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.908
You know, I'm just doing
my thing, that's all.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.897
I'm just, I'm not ready
for all of this, okay?

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:33.969
Excuse me.

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:02.870
Hey, Lee, Lee!
Hold up.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.414
What?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.251
You don't have to tell anybody,
okay?

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.661
Where in the hell have you been?

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.412
You hear me talking to you?

01:08:46.915 --> 01:08:49.541
- You left Bina hours ago!
- I am not Dad!

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:52.822
I'm not your husband, so
stop coming at me like I am!

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.608
I'm not your companion
and I'm not your friend!

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.720
You made that abundantly clear!

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:58.890
I'm your daughter!

01:08:59.341 --> 01:09:01.082
And I have my own shit
to deal with!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.584
You must have lost your damn mind!

01:09:03.608 --> 01:09:05.808
You wait till your father gets home!

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.772
I would be something
else if it wasn't for you!

01:09:43.796 --> 01:09:46.825
I'd be a lawyer maybe! Oh,
you wouldn't be shit because

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.642
I made you!
I made you!

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:49.810
You couldn't even
get a damn B...

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.060
Always thinking about yourself!

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.979
...on a test until I helped
you! We'd have more money!

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:55.315
We'd have a damn brownstone instead
of living in the basement of one!

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.401
You the one who's making a scene!
Doing all this paranoid shit!

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:58.527
- You're never here!
- I'm not paranoid.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:09:59.695
I can't take this shit anymore!

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:00.863
Will you stop saying that!

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.948
- It's the truth!
- Audrey, stop it!

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.325
Alike, go back to bed.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:07.160
- You have a slut on the side!
- Nothing's going on!

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.656
- I can't take this shit
anymore! - You are paranoid!

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.406
Alike, baby, go back to your room!

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:13.318
- Lee, no, no, no, no, no.
- Go upstairs.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:14.878
Don't leave me, please!
No, No!

01:10:14.902 --> 01:10:17.158
- Go in my room and lock
the door. - Keep me company, please?

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.382
Do not come
out the room!

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.759
Go upstairs in my room
and lock the door. Please!

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:23.927
I'm not paranoid!

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:25.554
You are paranoid!
All you do is break!

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:27.681
All you do is break!
When do I see you?

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:30.469
When do the kids see you? I
just need to get outta here!

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:31.670
You don't want to face the facts!

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.395
You don't wanna face the facts!
No dammit, that's not true!

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.938
It is true! Look, would
you stop saying that?

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.607
It is true!
Audrey, stop it!

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:38.275
Alike go back to bed.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.485
Your daughter is turning into a
damn man right before your eyes

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.237
and you can't even see it!
No, you take that back!

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:44.740
Shut the fuck up about that,
Audrey! Mom, Dad, stop! Please!

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:45.991
Tell him!

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.000
Tell him where you hang out!

01:10:48.024 --> 01:10:49.912
- Tell him about your butch-ass
girlfriend! - She isn't my girlfriend!

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.163
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.206
Alike, please, just go back
to your room, baby.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.833
- Tell him! Tell him!
- Tell me what?

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.461
- Tell him you're a nasty ass dyke!
- No! No! No!

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.464
Alike, you tell your mama
that's not true!

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:03.967
Baby, tell her!

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.512
- You see! You see!
- Will you shut the hell up?

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.222
- You tell her.
- Dad.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.934
You tell your mother
that's not true.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.102
- You already know.
- No, I don't know.

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:17.105
- You tell your mama it's just
a phase. - It's not a phase!

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.774
See, you should
have done something!

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.233
- You should have done something!
- What's wrong with you?

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.693
- There's nothing wrong with me!
- This is your fault!

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.654
Shut the hell up! Lemme
talk! If you had been here!

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:25.822
Yeah. I'm gay!

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.951
You say it again.
Say it again!

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.575
I'm a lesbian! Yeah, I'm a dyke!

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.892
Audrey! Audrey!

01:11:32.916 --> 01:11:34.721
Get off! Get off!

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:40.545
Audrey! No, you're not!
You get off of me!

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.756
Come on! You cheater!
You get off me!

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.341
- Get off of me!
- Come on, we gotta go!

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:10.570
Okay.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:26.044
Would you care to say grace?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.134
Heavenly Father,

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.762
we thank you for this food.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:39.057
We pray for your continued blessing.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.477
We pray...

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.107
We thank...
Amen.

01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.276
- Amen.
- This food should be delicious.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.486
I got the recipe from a magazine.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.114
And I made your green
beans that you like so much.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.700
Sharonda, could you
pass me the green beans?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.454
This is yummy.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.293
Dad, you know where she is.

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.403
Yo, Lee.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:02.767
Where's Mom?

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:05.625
She...

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.147
Your mother couldn't make it.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.072
You remember our old place?

01:16:16.946 --> 01:16:18.823
Way out in Queens?

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:24.356
It was our first apartment.
We were so proud.

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:27.582
It had all those trees around it.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.935
In October, the whole block
would be covered with leaves.

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:32.296
You remember?

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.676
Couldn't have been
more than two years old.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.780
When that wind would blow,

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.097
those leaves would come
rushing down the street at us.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.349
You thought they were alive.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.978
You'd get so scared.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:51.690
You'd cry and scream
and beg for us to pick you up.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.612
I would try and tell you,
"They're only leaves, baby,"

01:16:57.697 --> 01:16:59.197
and make you stay
on the ground,

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.825
but your mother
would always pick you up.

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.498
She always picked you up.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.778
Remember how we used to race
to the phone when it rang?

01:17:17.802 --> 01:17:20.828
I've been accepted into
an early college program.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:23.992
It starts in the spring.
It's in Berkeley.

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:27.058
It's a 10-week writing workshop.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:31.782
Boot camp, then I could
start summer semester.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.400
We can talk about that, okay?

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.485
I need you to meet
with my guidance counselor,

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.530
so you could sign the paperwork,
so I can graduate early.

01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:43.575
I'm sorry, all right?

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.161
I'm sorry I let her hurt you.

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:48.246
I just need to know if you'll
sign the paperwork. Yes or no?

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:50.206
- Can you forgive me?
- Yes or no?

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:54.252
You can always come back home.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:55.795
Things are going to be
different, I promise you.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.088
Dad...

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:00.842
I'm not runnin'.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.720
I'm choosin'.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.060
I'm not going back home.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:16.900
I know.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.208
And you could tell Mom
she was right.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.204
God doesn't make mistakes.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.748
You should tell her yourself.

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:46.304
Mom.

01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:53.144
Lee.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.563
Alike.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.900
How have you been?

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.277
Fine.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:04.072
Did Dad tell you?

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.242
Yeah. He told me.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.288
How you been?

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:17.270
I sure hope you've been
keeping yourself safe.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.266
I love you, Mom.

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.821
I said I love you.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.711
I'll be praying for you.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:14.184
"Heartbreak opens
onto the sunrise

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:19.564
