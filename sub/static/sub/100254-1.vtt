WEBVTT

01:03.009 --> 01:05.173
<i>Let's
welcome Mr. Bruce Lee</i>

01:05.175 --> 01:08.073
<i>from Jan Fan
Kung Fu Studio.</i>

01:54.943 --> 01:55.842
Mr. Ip.

01:57.642 --> 01:59.842
Your x-ray result shows
that your tumor is malignant.

02:02.642 --> 02:04.473
Even though it is still
at an early stage,

02:04.475 --> 02:06.340
the cancer cells
are spreading rapidly

02:06.342 --> 02:09.674
for it to be controlled
by standard medication.

02:09.675 --> 02:11.409
Nowadays, hospitals
offer chemotherapy.

02:12.409 --> 02:14.807
It can control cancer cells.

02:14.809 --> 02:16.075
You should think about it.

02:18.075 --> 02:19.776
First, you must quit smoking.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.409
Don't smoke anymore.

02:31.442 --> 02:35.709
MRS. IP, CHEUNG WING-SING

03:01.676 --> 03:03.542
THIRD FLOOR

03:05.009 --> 03:06.307
No.

03:06.309 --> 03:07.442
Turn your stance more.

03:08.943 --> 03:10.907
Rotate your torso.

03:10.909 --> 03:12.709
That's right.

03:17.142 --> 03:18.409
Yeah!

03:21.108 --> 03:22.373
No. Come on, man.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.041
- That's not right.
- What?

03:24.043 --> 03:26.507
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, chill, chill. Relax.

03:26.509 --> 03:27.776
I'm just tryin' to share
my thoughts.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.607
Does anybody know
what he's saying?

03:31.609 --> 03:32.842
No.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.907
No more shows for you.

03:35.909 --> 03:37.607
- Relax, we're kung fu brothers.
- Leave.

03:37.609 --> 03:38.840
- It's fine.
- Just listen to me.

03:38.842 --> 03:40.540
- Calm down, man. Easy, easy.
- I don't understand you.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.073
- Just leave.
- Just listen to me!

03:42.075 --> 03:43.340
- What's wrong with you?
- Are you nuts?

03:43.342 --> 03:45.106
Do you want me to beat you up?

03:45.108 --> 03:46.340
- Get lost!
- Don't push me.

03:46.342 --> 03:48.275
- I said get lost!
- I said don't push me!

03:49.043 --> 03:50.707
Here to challenge us?

03:50.709 --> 03:51.974
Okay.

04:04.242 --> 04:05.342
Hmm?

04:10.976 --> 04:12.907
- Master.
- Master.

04:12.909 --> 04:13.974
Grandmaster!

04:13.976 --> 04:15.240
Yes!

04:15.242 --> 04:17.406
I'm so happy to see you! Woohoo!

04:17.409 --> 04:18.774
- Why is he so excited?
- Huh?

04:20.142 --> 04:21.206
I'm a student of Bruce Lee.

04:21.208 --> 04:22.407
My name's Billy.

04:22.409 --> 04:23.676
I have something for you.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.140
Sifu wants you to come to the
Karate tournament in the US

04:30.142 --> 04:31.442
which takes place next month.

04:32.909 --> 04:35.440
Here, this is a plane ticket
for you he prepared.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.907
And this book, he wrote it.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.208
He wants you to have it.

04:39.943 --> 04:41.409
- Bruce.
- Bruce?

04:42.043 --> 04:43.173
Bruce Lee?

04:43.175 --> 04:44.240
He is good?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.373
He's doin' fine.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.740
He has a Kung Fu school
in Seattle.

04:46.742 --> 04:49.142
And I'm from his newly
opened one in San Francisco.

04:52.909 --> 04:54.108
Billy.

04:55.776 --> 04:57.142
Tell Bruce...

04:58.275 --> 04:59.776
maybe I have no time.

05:00.776 --> 05:03.108
- Thank you.
- Oh.

05:05.342 --> 05:07.142
Thank you.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.742
What is going on?

05:28.309 --> 05:30.309
- Give this to Grandmaster.
- Hey!

05:31.208 --> 05:34.173
What is it?

05:34.175 --> 05:35.709
Give me back
my comic book.

05:43.275 --> 05:44.742
Give it back.

05:51.409 --> 05:53.307
Mr. Ip.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.275
This is Ip Ching's
expulsion letter.

05:57.442 --> 06:00.342
We can't keep him
in our school anymore.

06:01.576 --> 06:03.041
Headmaster.

06:03.043 --> 06:05.307
Can you give Ip Ching
one more chance?

06:05.309 --> 06:08.007
I promise he will behave.

06:08.009 --> 06:09.774
Please give him another chance.

06:09.776 --> 06:11.540
Let him stay.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.707
It's not his first time
getting into a fight.

06:13.709 --> 06:16.874
Last time
was already his last chance.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.640
Since he is so sportive,

06:18.642 --> 06:21.375
it may be better for him
to study abroad.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.106
It's not serious.
They're just minor cuts.

06:31.108 --> 06:32.542
But be careful next time.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.007
Thank you, doctor.

06:35.009 --> 06:36.776
The nurse will patch you up.

06:38.842 --> 06:40.106
Where is your family?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.309
Doctor.

06:42.275 --> 06:44.041
Master Ip.

06:44.043 --> 06:45.774
It has been a while.

06:45.776 --> 06:48.273
I am Ming, Ms Luk's son.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.907
Your kung fu studio used to be
on our rooftop.

06:50.909 --> 06:52.073
Oh.

06:52.075 --> 06:53.707
My mom sent me
to study in America

06:53.709 --> 06:55.707
since I was too naughty.

06:55.709 --> 06:56.574
I just came back.

06:56.576 --> 06:58.740
I work in this hospital now.

06:58.742 --> 07:01.707
It's really something
to be abroad on your own.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.106
Not really.

07:03.108 --> 07:04.173
Master Ip.

07:04.175 --> 07:06.574
Ching is fine, don't worry.

07:06.576 --> 07:08.309
- See you later.
- Thank you.

07:42.075 --> 07:43.275
Answer the door, Ching.

07:58.442 --> 08:01.375
- Master Ip.
- Hi, Bob. Please come in.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.106
What's the matter?

08:04.108 --> 08:05.473
America is so far away.

08:05.475 --> 08:07.574
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

08:07.576 --> 08:11.407
I am going to San Francisco
to look for a school for Ching.

08:11.409 --> 08:14.774
Good idea. Mr. Ba also sent
his son there recently.

08:14.776 --> 08:15.840
One can earn much more

08:15.842 --> 08:17.041
after studying overseas..

08:17.043 --> 08:19.240
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

08:19.242 --> 08:21.642
- Have some tea.
- Don't bother.

08:23.542 --> 08:24.475
Ching.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.774
- Greet your elder.
- He did, he nodded.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.142
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.

08:32.676 --> 08:34.774
- Bob.
- Yes?

08:34.775 --> 08:39.206
Can you please come to check
on Ching while I'm away?

08:39.207 --> 08:40.941
Not a problem.

08:40.943 --> 08:42.106
While I'm in America,

08:42.107 --> 08:45.707
I will phone home at 10:00 p.m.
Hong Kong time every day.

08:45.709 --> 08:46.707
Okay.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.609
You don't have to call.
I won't answer it.

08:50.842 --> 08:51.740
Don't worry.

08:51.742 --> 08:54.307
I will be here on time
to make him answer the call.

08:54.309 --> 08:56.507
Right, don't be too soft
on your son.

08:56.509 --> 08:59.840
- You're spoiling him.
- No, I have to.

08:59.842 --> 09:01.140
I want to send him abroad

09:01.142 --> 09:03.473
so that he'll have
a chance to experience

09:03.475 --> 09:06.340
- how it is to be independent.
- That's right.

09:06.342 --> 09:08.073
I won't go.

09:08.075 --> 09:09.542
If you want to go,
go by yourself.

09:11.075 --> 09:13.941
If you have something to say,
come here and say it, okay?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.707
There's no way
I'm going to America.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.140
You can't make me.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.607
I have told you many times.

09:21.609 --> 09:23.607
I don't like studying at all.

09:23.609 --> 09:25.073
I'm not cut out for it anyway.

09:25.075 --> 09:27.007
What can you do
if you don't study?

09:27.009 --> 09:28.307
I can teach martial arts.

09:28.309 --> 09:29.807
I like kung fu.

09:29.809 --> 09:31.275
Who'll let you teach
martial arts?

09:32.075 --> 09:33.574
Why can't I?

09:33.576 --> 09:35.540
Aren't you doing it yourself?

09:35.542 --> 09:37.206
Why don't you tell your students

09:37.208 --> 09:38.273
it's useless to learn
martial arts?

09:38.275 --> 09:39.874
- Enough.
- If nobody learned martial arts,

09:39.876 --> 09:40.974
you'd be starving already.

09:40.976 --> 09:42.307
You don't practice
what you preach.

09:42.309 --> 09:44.206
You always think that I'm wrong.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.041
Someone took my comic book,
it's my fault.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.640
He failed, it's my fault.

09:47.642 --> 09:48.874
- I want to teach kung fu.
- Enough.

09:48.876 --> 09:49.840
It's also my fault.

09:49.842 --> 09:51.874
You are always right
and I am always wrong.

09:51.876 --> 09:53.307
You are never supportive of me.

09:53.309 --> 09:54.974
If Mom was still alive,
she would have...

09:54.976 --> 09:56.507
Don't.

09:56.509 --> 09:58.440
Get out.

09:58.442 --> 10:00.507
Get out!

10:00.509 --> 10:01.442
Shut up.

10:04.609 --> 10:05.740
Hey.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.709
He's still a kid.
Be patient with him.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.509
Don't be angry.

10:18.542 --> 10:20.007
Bob.

10:20.009 --> 10:21.475
I'll leave it to you.

10:22.108 --> 10:23.208
Please sit down.

10:46.309 --> 10:47.373
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen,</i>

10:47.375 --> 10:49.340
<i>we are approaching
San Francisco Airport</i>

10:49.342 --> 10:51.475
<i>where the local time
is 11:15 a.m.</i>

11:01.809 --> 11:04.807
Passengers for flight
43EI to Miami

11:04.809 --> 11:07.574
<i>and stops at Atlanta
and Toronto.</i>

11:07.576 --> 11:10.507
<i>The departure gate has
been changed to Gate 21...</i>

11:10.509 --> 11:11.475
Mr. Ip.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.507
- Mr. Ip, it has been many years.
- Yes.

11:14.509 --> 11:16.540
- Are you tired from the flight?
- I'm all right.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.340
My car is outside. Let's go.

11:18.342 --> 11:19.507
Let me carry this.

11:19.509 --> 11:20.576
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

11:30.442 --> 11:33.373
It has been nearly
eight years since we last met.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.507
<i>That's about right.</i>

11:35.509 --> 11:36.507
- <i>Hey, Gun.</i>
- Huh?

11:36.509 --> 11:38.507
Why did you move
to America?

11:38.509 --> 11:39.840
<i>It wasn't my plan.</i>

11:39.842 --> 11:42.340
My newspaper office sent me
here for the US and Canada edition.

11:42.342 --> 11:43.941
There are more Chinese residents
here now.

11:43.943 --> 11:46.707
Many people send
their children here to study.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.540
It's the right time
for Ching to come.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.807
Is the recommendation letter
for school admission

11:50.809 --> 11:52.674
from the Chinese Benevolent
Association ready?

11:52.676 --> 11:54.073
I contacted them.

11:54.075 --> 11:56.707
Mr. Wan, the chairman,
would like to meet you first.

11:56.709 --> 11:59.509
Once we arrive at Chinatown,
we'll head to the association.

12:03.842 --> 12:06.208
CHINATOWN

12:22.409 --> 12:24.407
- It's not long enough.
- It's not?

12:24.409 --> 12:26.007
Has Mr. Wan
been here for long?

12:26.009 --> 12:29.674
Ah, his family
has been here for generations.

12:29.676 --> 12:33.273
His grandfather came here
during the Gold Rush.

12:33.275 --> 12:34.842
He really does care
for the compatriots.

12:48.009 --> 12:49.108
Let's go.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.407
Mr. Gwai.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.740
- Hello, Mr. Gwai.
- Mr. Leung.

12:59.742 --> 13:01.674
- Hello.
- This is Master Ip.

13:01.676 --> 13:03.240
- Hello, Mr. Gwai.
- A pleasure to meet you.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.340
Has Mr. Wan arrived?

13:04.342 --> 13:05.974
- Master Ip.
- He's here.

13:05.976 --> 13:07.206
Master Law.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.373
It has been a long time.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.941
- Yes.
- It's really me.

13:09.943 --> 13:11.007
I didn't know you moved here.

13:11.009 --> 13:13.507
I've been here with my family
for a few years already.

13:13.509 --> 13:16.607
So are you visiting
to prepare to move here as well?

13:16.609 --> 13:18.774
Master Law, Mr. Ip
is not moving here.

13:18.776 --> 13:20.073
Shall we sit and talk?

13:20.075 --> 13:22.108
- Sure. After you.
- After you.

13:24.642 --> 13:26.307
Masters, allow me
to introduce you.

13:26.309 --> 13:27.409
This is Master Ip Man.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.242
Hello, fellow masters.

13:37.342 --> 13:38.941
Take a seat.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.208
Sit.

13:42.242 --> 13:44.307
Let me introduce everyone.

13:44.309 --> 13:47.542
They are all kung fu masters
from Chinatown.

13:48.509 --> 13:51.142
Master Lau of Choy Li Fut.

13:52.208 --> 13:54.874
Master Chen of Eagle Claw.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.206
Master Han of White Crane.

13:57.208 --> 13:59.974
Master Chiu
of Seven-Star Mantis.

13:59.976 --> 14:02.607
Master Chiang of Xing Yi.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.173
Master Lui
of Eight Trigrams Palm.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.607
Master Tam of Tam's Kick.

14:07.609 --> 14:09.974
As for me, let's spare
the introduction.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.373
We are old friends.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.574
Last but not least,

14:12.576 --> 14:14.140
Chairman of the
Chinese Benevolent Association,

14:14.142 --> 14:16.576
Master Wan of Tai Chi.

14:22.809 --> 14:24.206
Master Wan.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.574
Thank you so much for your help.

14:26.576 --> 14:27.907
Master Ip.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.175
Don't thank me just yet.

14:30.242 --> 14:31.542
I've heard so much about you.

14:33.142 --> 14:36.007
You're here
at just the right time.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.073
I'd like to ask Master Ip
a favor.

14:39.075 --> 14:40.175
How can I help?

14:42.275 --> 14:44.640
Here in San Francisco's
Chinatown,

14:44.642 --> 14:46.840
there is
a long-established rule.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.640
All kung fu studios

14:48.642 --> 14:51.206
should only accept
Chinese students.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.507
Your apprentice, Bruce Lee,

14:53.509 --> 14:55.473
not only accepted
Western students,

14:55.475 --> 14:58.807
but he even published a book

14:58.809 --> 15:02.442
to explain Chinese martial arts
in English.

15:11.108 --> 15:12.874
Since Master Ip is here,

15:12.876 --> 15:16.175
why don't you help us
solve this issue first?

15:19.342 --> 15:21.007
Does he think

15:21.009 --> 15:23.175
he can be the spokesperson
of Chinese martial arts?

15:24.509 --> 15:28.375
Your apprentice is too arrogant.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.874
He even said

15:30.876 --> 15:33.206
he would compete
in the karate tournament.

15:33.208 --> 15:36.140
He is provoking us.

15:36.142 --> 15:37.941
He is clearly provoking us.

15:37.943 --> 15:39.275
Exactly.

15:44.309 --> 15:45.676
I have read this book.

15:47.142 --> 15:48.242
It's well written.

15:49.609 --> 15:52.208
What's wrong with teaching
Western students?

15:55.275 --> 15:56.440
Master Ip.

15:56.442 --> 15:59.674
Have you heard of the story
of Mr. Dong Guo?

15:59.676 --> 16:03.075
A wolf
was sieged by a hunter.

16:04.075 --> 16:05.840
Mr. Dong Guo saw this.

16:05.842 --> 16:10.840
He saved the wolf
and put the wolf in his bag.

16:10.842 --> 16:14.175
Once the hunter left,
the first thing the wolf did

16:15.275 --> 16:18.208
was to eat Mr. Dong Guo alive.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.774
Animals are animals.

16:20.776 --> 16:23.075
They won't be grateful.

16:24.809 --> 16:29.340
I will use one
of your Cantonese sayings.

16:29.342 --> 16:32.674
"You offer them rice,
then they betray you."

16:32.676 --> 16:35.776
That's a bit dramatic.

16:38.709 --> 16:39.709
Master Ip.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.941
We're strangers
in a foreign land.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.740
You don't live here.

16:47.742 --> 16:48.742
You won't understand.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.809
How about this?

16:52.108 --> 16:53.809
Drink this cup of tea...

16:54.976 --> 16:56.607
and you are one of us.

16:56.609 --> 16:59.442
I'll write the letter for you.

17:16.909 --> 17:17.809
Fellow masters.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.205
Mr. Wan.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.240
You might have
misunderstood Bruce.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.941
In fact, Bruce just wants
Chinese martial arts

17:26.943 --> 17:28.440
to have a wider following.

17:28.442 --> 17:29.742
I think it's a wonderful thing.

17:32.776 --> 17:36.041
Marching to a different beat
to make a name for oneself.

17:36.043 --> 17:39.440
Like student, like master.

17:39.442 --> 17:41.540
Do you two have what it takes

17:41.542 --> 17:44.242
to be the exemplars
of Chinese martial arts?

18:12.342 --> 18:13.774
It's going to break.

18:13.776 --> 18:15.941
Mr. Ip, let's forget
about it, shall we?

18:26.809 --> 18:27.842
Sorry to bother you.

18:28.976 --> 18:30.142
Excuse me.

18:34.442 --> 18:35.807
Excuse us, everyone.

18:35.809 --> 18:37.208
Mr. Wan, excuse us.

18:54.108 --> 18:56.307
- Thank you.
- Mr. Ip.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.740
I am sorry about what happened.

18:57.742 --> 18:59.742
- I didn't expect that.
- It's not your fault.

19:00.976 --> 19:02.340
- Gun.
- Hmm?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.640
Is the recommendation letter
essential

19:03.642 --> 19:05.740
for meeting
the school principal?

19:05.742 --> 19:07.340
Yes.

19:07.342 --> 19:09.507
After all, we are immigrants.

19:09.509 --> 19:13.273
Schools here only acknowledge
reputable people.

19:13.275 --> 19:15.540
- A recommendation is a must.
- Mm-hm.

19:15.542 --> 19:16.440
Don't worry.

19:16.442 --> 19:17.674
I have some American friends.

19:17.676 --> 19:19.041
I'll ask them
to write the letter.

19:19.043 --> 19:20.273
- Okay.
- I won't keep you.

19:20.275 --> 19:21.373
Get some rest.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.442
- Let me walk you out.
- Sure.

19:24.309 --> 19:25.407
Take care.

19:25.409 --> 19:27.142
- Bye, Mr. Ip.
- Thank you for your help.

19:46.842 --> 19:49.507
Operator.
Where would you like to call?

19:49.509 --> 19:51.340
Hong Kong.

19:51.342 --> 19:56.307
"Eight, four, two,
six, three, nine."

19:56.309 --> 19:57.742
<i>Okay,
one moment.</i>

20:00.342 --> 20:02.941
Hello! Hello!
Hello, Master Ip!

20:02.943 --> 20:04.106
<i>It's me, Bob!</i>

20:04.108 --> 20:06.041
I can hear you, Bob.
Loud and clear.

20:06.043 --> 20:07.140
Really?

20:07.142 --> 20:08.373
How are things over there?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.073
I heard the air
is fresher there.

20:10.075 --> 20:11.240
It's a huge country.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.175
It's so vast that you can't
even see the buildings across you.

20:15.842 --> 20:16.742
Not exactly.

20:17.742 --> 20:20.206
Right. Is Ching there?

20:20.208 --> 20:22.106
Can you put him on the phone?

20:22.108 --> 20:24.108
Ching. Come take the call.

20:28.943 --> 20:30.807
Hurry up.

20:30.809 --> 20:32.576
Long-distance calls cost a lot.

20:36.108 --> 20:38.407
He won't answer.

20:38.409 --> 20:39.507
That's how they are.

20:39.509 --> 20:41.941
Defiance is the trademark
of youth.

20:41.943 --> 20:44.507
Listen, this is important.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.840
<i>My wife heard that there
are some meds</i>

20:46.842 --> 20:48.740
that are only sold in the US
and not in Hong Kong.

20:48.742 --> 20:50.941
Can you help me
get some just in case?

20:50.943 --> 20:52.041
No problem.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.974
Please write them down.

20:53.976 --> 20:54.941
<i>It's in English.</i>

20:54.943 --> 20:56.807
<i>I will spell it out slowly.
Write them down.</i>

20:56.809 --> 20:58.273
The first one is...

20:58.275 --> 21:03.809
"L-I-U-Q-I-D..."

21:08.776 --> 21:09.676
Dad.

21:10.943 --> 21:12.240
Why are you late again?

21:12.242 --> 21:13.574
I am exhausted today.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.273
I just finished
all the assignments.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.440
I took a nap before I came.

21:18.442 --> 21:20.340
You're not exhausted
when practicing cheerleading,

21:20.342 --> 21:22.740
but you are when it comes
to martial arts, huh?

21:22.742 --> 21:24.642
You don't get tired
of doing what you like.

21:26.342 --> 21:28.108
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

21:28.742 --> 21:30.206
Come.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.208
Brush knees and twist steps.

21:36.108 --> 21:38.375
Part the horse's mane.

21:46.876 --> 21:48.206
Sink the shoulders.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.640
Drop the elbows.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.676
Round form.

21:52.009 --> 21:54.475
See how terrible your moves are.

21:55.776 --> 21:57.707
Look at yourself.

21:57.709 --> 22:00.206
How can you join
the Mid-Autumn Festival?

22:00.208 --> 22:02.175
How can you go on stage?

22:05.309 --> 22:08.108
God, this is so tedious.

22:12.075 --> 22:13.507
How many times have I told you?

22:13.509 --> 22:16.609
In here,
you have to speak Chinese.

22:19.242 --> 22:21.640
Hi, Mr. Wright.
How are you?

22:21.642 --> 22:23.507
I thought I was gonna be
speaking with your boss.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.874
Actually, it's not
my boss who send me.

22:26.876 --> 22:29.607
I have something perhaps
you can help me with.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.275
Okay, what
can I do for you?

22:32.342 --> 22:34.807
This is my friend, Ip Man.

22:34.809 --> 22:36.173
How do you do?

22:36.175 --> 22:38.140
He is looking for a school
for his son

22:38.142 --> 22:39.874
to attend in America.

22:39.876 --> 22:42.307
So maybe you can help him

22:42.309 --> 22:44.774
by writing
a recommendation letter.

22:44.776 --> 22:46.642
Can I have a minute
with you, please?

22:50.676 --> 22:56.173
Mr. Leung, nowadays, many people
fancy comin' over here

22:56.175 --> 22:57.907
to try and find a better life.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.407
Your luck is your ability.

23:00.409 --> 23:02.073
And you achieve
because you choose

23:02.075 --> 23:03.774
to work with a great boss.

23:03.776 --> 23:05.173
But your friend here...

23:05.175 --> 23:07.007
He is a Chinese kung fu master.

23:07.009 --> 23:11.041
Look, I don't really
know you that well.

23:11.043 --> 23:12.907
I certainly don't know him.

23:12.909 --> 23:16.407
How do I know that he isn't
some kind of fugitive

23:16.409 --> 23:18.340
just like all of the other
illegal aliens

23:18.342 --> 23:21.206
that get deported every day
from Chinatown?

23:21.208 --> 23:22.674
I think you're
being biased.

23:22.676 --> 23:25.674
Not all Chinese
are criminals, Mr. Wright.

23:25.676 --> 23:27.540
Listen, sonny.

23:27.542 --> 23:31.206
The only reason that you're
standing here on my property

23:31.208 --> 23:35.140
wasting my valuable time
is because of your boss.

23:35.142 --> 23:37.874
I'm only doing this
for the sake of my friend.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.409
Not you. You understand?

23:45.309 --> 23:47.907
Mr. Ip. I am sorry.

23:47.909 --> 23:48.809
Don't worry.

23:52.075 --> 23:55.373
- We'll find a way.
- Mm.

24:21.342 --> 24:24.206
Great stuff, man. Really good.

24:24.208 --> 24:25.540
I love that swing kick.

24:25.542 --> 24:26.842
- Here, let me.
- This is crazy.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.373
This match is fixed.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.642
Just a gook dance.

24:52.175 --> 24:53.309
Phonies.

25:11.742 --> 25:12.642
Woo!

25:32.542 --> 25:33.542
Enjoy.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.740
Congratulations, Bruce.

25:36.742 --> 25:39.140
Your performance tonight
was fantastic.

25:39.142 --> 25:40.407
Thank you, Master.

25:40.409 --> 25:42.073
Thank you for inviting me
to America.

25:42.075 --> 25:44.440
You are welcome.

25:44.442 --> 25:49.576
Actually, I'm also here to try
to find a school for Ching.

25:50.876 --> 25:52.106
You know,

25:52.108 --> 25:54.540
a recommendation letter is
needed for school application.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.907
So, do you mean

25:56.909 --> 25:59.375
those folks from the association
refused to write you a letter?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.974
I have a student
who is a lawyer.

26:03.976 --> 26:05.674
He should be able to help.

26:05.676 --> 26:06.774
Don't worry.

26:06.776 --> 26:08.540
- Thank you.
- Mm.

26:08.542 --> 26:09.607
- Master.
- Hey.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.707
- Master.
- Over here.

26:10.709 --> 26:12.507
- Master.
- They're my students.

26:12.509 --> 26:15.140
- Grandmaster, how you doing?
- Hartman, come and sit.

26:15.142 --> 26:16.373
Hey. Hello.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.073
- Amazing.
- Hello.

26:18.075 --> 26:19.507
- Master.
- Grandmaster.

26:19.509 --> 26:22.206
This is Hartman.
He's one of a kind.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.774
He's a Marine Staff Sergeant.

26:24.776 --> 26:26.574
He's very much
into Chinese martial arts.

26:26.576 --> 26:28.907
He always tells me he wants to
introduce Chinese martial arts

26:28.909 --> 26:30.106
to the Marines.

26:30.108 --> 26:34.273
In America, most people don't
know about Chinese martial arts.

26:34.275 --> 26:35.707
I have practiced
Wing Chun for a while.

26:35.709 --> 26:38.307
Its centerline theory
for both attack and defense

26:38.309 --> 26:39.540
is useful for combat.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.507
I'd recommend it to my officer.

26:41.509 --> 26:42.840
What do you think, Grandmaster?

26:42.842 --> 26:43.907
Great idea.

26:45.475 --> 26:47.840
Hey, yo, kung fu man!

26:47.842 --> 26:49.106
I saw you
at the tournament tonight.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.709
I think your stuff is bullshit.

26:51.642 --> 26:53.340
I don't buy it.

26:54.943 --> 26:56.106
What's up, man?

26:56.108 --> 26:58.173
- You wanna try it?
- Hartman.

26:58.175 --> 26:59.807
Let's take it outside.

27:01.043 --> 27:02.307
I'll kick your ass, man.

27:02.309 --> 27:03.542
I'll kick your ass too.

27:04.909 --> 27:06.776
- Let's take 'em out here.
- I'll take you outside.

27:07.576 --> 27:08.807
Master.

27:08.809 --> 27:10.642
This happens all the time.
I'll be right back.

27:31.142 --> 27:33.342
Mm, mm, mm!

27:34.108 --> 27:35.576
Hmph.

27:54.475 --> 27:55.409
You.

28:15.142 --> 28:16.840
The door won't fight back.

28:16.842 --> 28:18.208
But I will

30:56.909 --> 30:58.542
Uh...

31:42.709 --> 31:43.540
<i>Master.</i>

31:43.542 --> 31:45.941
Here's the recommendation letter
<i>prepared by my student.</i>

31:45.943 --> 31:46.809
<i>It should be okay.</i>

31:56.242 --> 31:57.473
How do you do?

31:57.475 --> 31:59.740
- Hi. How are you today?
- It's very good.

31:59.742 --> 32:02.842
I have a appointment
with the principal.

32:05.108 --> 32:07.073
- "Mr. Ip Man," right?
- Yes.

32:07.075 --> 32:09.273
Do you have all
the required documents?

32:09.275 --> 32:10.807
- Yes.
- Okay.

32:10.809 --> 32:11.742
Follow me, please.

32:18.075 --> 32:20.574
Is everybody okay?

32:20.576 --> 32:23.106
If anybody needs any help,
just let me know.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.240
Mr. Spencer.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.574
You, sir. Fire away.

32:26.576 --> 32:28.340
The principal
is very busy today.

32:28.342 --> 32:30.574
She's in a meeting.
So would you mind waiting?

32:30.576 --> 32:33.409
- Yes. No problem.
- Okay.

32:39.576 --> 32:43.507
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

32:43.509 --> 32:47.307
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

32:47.309 --> 32:50.941
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

32:50.943 --> 32:54.840
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

32:54.842 --> 32:58.707
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

32:58.709 --> 33:02.574
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:02.576 --> 33:06.440
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:06.442 --> 33:10.440
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:10.442 --> 33:14.340
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:14.342 --> 33:18.173
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:18.175 --> 33:20.208
And good job, girls!

33:22.809 --> 33:26.874
Okay, the contest is over.
I have made my decision.

33:26.876 --> 33:28.740
Yonah, you will be
the new cheerleader

33:28.742 --> 33:31.574
for away games starting
this mid-semester.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.240
Well done.

33:33.242 --> 33:35.206
She doesn't deserve it.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.540
What?

33:36.542 --> 33:39.674
She changed the routine
all on her own.

33:39.676 --> 33:41.073
She cheated.

33:41.075 --> 33:43.874
- Ah...
- She should be disqualified.

33:43.876 --> 33:45.173
Okay, I don't remember saying

33:45.175 --> 33:47.206
that improvisation
wasn't allowed.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.007
Since I haven't finalized
the routines,

33:49.009 --> 33:51.707
anyone's input is welcomed.

33:51.709 --> 33:54.240
Yonah's... her, her move
was amazing.

33:54.242 --> 33:56.140
And so is she.

33:56.142 --> 33:57.740
We all have the same goals.

33:57.742 --> 34:00.707
Why don't we try
to work together?

34:00.709 --> 34:01.840
Well done.

34:01.842 --> 34:03.507
Class dismissed.

34:15.375 --> 34:18.340
Mr. Ip, I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

34:18.342 --> 34:19.473
- No problem.
- I was stuck

34:19.475 --> 34:21.306
in a very important meeting.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.175
- No problem.
- Come, please.

34:24.442 --> 34:27.340
This lawyer
who wrote the letter,

34:27.342 --> 34:29.041
is he your lawyer?

34:29.043 --> 34:31.172
Actually, he is my student.

34:31.175 --> 34:32.440
Student.

34:32.442 --> 34:34.806
So you're a teacher too?

34:34.809 --> 34:36.242
I am a teacher.

34:37.175 --> 34:39.373
I teach Chinese kung fu.

34:39.375 --> 34:40.742
Chinese martial art.

34:41.943 --> 34:43.774
Like a gymnast?

34:43.775 --> 34:45.440
Yes, something like that.

34:45.442 --> 34:48.674
Well, as you already know,

34:48.676 --> 34:52.507
this is an exclusive
private school.

34:52.509 --> 34:56.840
I can accept this letter
as a referral.

34:56.842 --> 34:59.407
But you still need to get
a recommendation

34:59.409 --> 35:02.407
from the Chinese Benevolent
Association

35:02.409 --> 35:07.242
as they act as guarantors
for late school payment.

35:08.175 --> 35:09.475
- However...
- I understand.

35:11.342 --> 35:14.507
If you can donate $10,000
to our school,

35:14.509 --> 35:18.607
to be one of our sponsoring
board of directors,

35:18.609 --> 35:21.173
we can waive
the recommendation letter

35:21.175 --> 35:22.842
and accept your son right away.

35:36.309 --> 35:37.442
Speak of the devil.

35:39.509 --> 35:40.509
Bitch!

35:44.642 --> 35:45.941
Showtime.

35:45.943 --> 35:49.240
You think you look
so great out there.

35:49.242 --> 35:51.507
You look like
a little yellow monkey.

35:51.509 --> 35:53.007
We're not gonna
follow your lead.

35:53.009 --> 35:57.307
In America, people like you
follow. They don't lead.

35:57.309 --> 35:59.206
What do you want?
Just leave me alone.

35:59.208 --> 36:02.407
If you're not happy,
then go back to Asia,

36:02.409 --> 36:05.840
This has been our land
for generations.

36:05.842 --> 36:08.507
What do you people want from us?

36:08.509 --> 36:11.373
Now I know why they call you
a stupid blonde.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.340
America has always
had immigrants.

36:13.342 --> 36:15.874
The Indians
are the only real Americans.

36:15.876 --> 36:19.442
Your ancestors
stole their land, paleface.

36:21.242 --> 36:23.373
What did you just say to me?

36:42.742 --> 36:43.776
She's the one.

36:44.876 --> 36:45.776
Grab her.

36:55.142 --> 36:57.707
Get her there.

36:57.709 --> 37:01.874
I dare you to stay
in cheerleading.

37:01.876 --> 37:05.340
- Go at her! Come on, hit her!
- You've got your long hair.

37:05.342 --> 37:07.173
You think you can beat me?

37:07.175 --> 37:09.941
You could never beat me!

37:18.842 --> 37:21.273
- Oh, god!
- You, come back here!

37:21.275 --> 37:22.809
Go, go!

37:25.375 --> 37:27.674
Come back here!
Where are you going?

37:27.676 --> 37:28.842
Get her, man!

37:36.842 --> 37:40.840
I'm gonna cut all of your hair
since you got lice anyway.

37:40.842 --> 37:42.540
Get that good.

37:51.709 --> 37:53.208
Ah!

38:00.475 --> 38:03.574
- Ah!
- Get her! Get her!

38:03.576 --> 38:05.073
Close the door!
Close the door!

38:05.075 --> 38:06.509
Smash it! Smash it!

38:15.375 --> 38:17.440
Stay out of this, old man.

38:17.442 --> 38:19.974
Oh, you want some too?

38:33.943 --> 38:35.242
Stop! No.

38:36.909 --> 38:38.409
No...

38:44.909 --> 38:46.707
No! No more! No! I'm sorry.

38:46.709 --> 38:48.342
- I can't anymore.
- Let's take off.

38:57.475 --> 39:00.173
I am Yonah.
What's your name, sir?

39:00.175 --> 39:02.542
You can call me
Mr. Ip, Yonah.

39:07.108 --> 39:08.941
Mr. Ip, can you
hold this for me?

39:08.943 --> 39:09.842
Mm-hm.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.273
Mr. Ip, please take a look
from behind.

39:22.275 --> 39:25.142
Please help me cut it
if it's not neat.

39:36.976 --> 39:38.809
- Done.
- Thank you.

39:43.876 --> 39:47.007
Mr. Ip, are you okay?
You were slammed by the gate.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.142
- I'm okay.
- Let me take a look.

39:48.842 --> 39:50.106
Whoa!

39:50.108 --> 39:52.273
I am really fine.

39:52.275 --> 39:53.974
I have some herbal ointment
at home.

39:53.976 --> 39:55.774
It works like magic.

39:55.776 --> 39:58.073
About what happened
at school today,

39:58.075 --> 39:59.807
does it happen often?

39:59.809 --> 40:01.106
It's not the first time.

40:01.108 --> 40:02.409
But I am not afraid of them.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.206
- Does your family know?
- Yes.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.307
My dad always asks me
to put up with it.

40:08.309 --> 40:09.707
He is very strict.

40:09.709 --> 40:12.373
Mr. Ip, why were you
in our school?

40:12.375 --> 40:14.974
I was there to apply for my son.

40:14.976 --> 40:16.373
Then you must have met my dad.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.442
He is the Chairman of the
Chinese Benevolent Association.

40:19.676 --> 40:21.440
I have met your dad.

40:21.442 --> 40:23.373
He must have given you
the letter, then.

40:23.375 --> 40:26.273
Mr. Ip, when will your son come?

40:26.275 --> 40:28.073
He'll have a hard time
getting used to life here.

40:28.075 --> 40:29.175
I can help out.

40:30.542 --> 40:32.707
Actually, your dad didn't help
with the letter.

40:32.709 --> 40:35.273
How come?
You are not a foreigner.

40:35.275 --> 40:37.674
Does your dad have an opinion
against them?

40:37.676 --> 40:38.574
Yes.

40:38.576 --> 40:42.273
He always says that they
are very bad to the Chinese.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.240
They only discriminate
and bully us.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.440
It has always been like that

40:46.442 --> 40:47.874
since he came here
with Grandpa as a kid.

40:47.876 --> 40:50.740
The way the Chinese are treated
here has always been unfair.

40:50.742 --> 40:53.007
That's why he founded the
Chinese Benevolent Association

40:53.009 --> 40:54.542
to protect us Chinese.

41:00.943 --> 41:02.108
Sweetheart.

41:02.776 --> 41:03.709
What's happened?

41:05.909 --> 41:07.440
Oh, my god!

41:07.442 --> 41:08.576
What happened?

41:10.009 --> 41:12.674
This Chinese girl.

41:12.676 --> 41:14.842
I need you
to come home right now.

41:16.108 --> 41:17.709
Becky's been attacked.

41:18.909 --> 41:21.275
I wish you weren't away
on this business trip.

41:22.142 --> 41:23.842
We need you here.

41:24.909 --> 41:26.576
Come home now, okay?

41:43.208 --> 41:44.309
Dad.

41:45.108 --> 41:47.206
This is my friend, Mr. Ip.

41:47.208 --> 41:50.240
You always say Chinese people
should help each other out.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.309
So please write him
a recommendation letter.

42:03.108 --> 42:04.208
Come over here.

42:11.342 --> 42:12.576
Did you get into a fight again?

42:14.142 --> 42:15.574
No.

42:15.576 --> 42:16.475
Yonah.

42:17.776 --> 42:20.375
You know how I hate liars.

42:21.275 --> 42:22.609
I will ask you one more time.

42:23.442 --> 42:24.542
Did you get into a fight?

42:25.742 --> 42:26.674
No.

42:26.676 --> 42:29.041
- Hey!
- They were jealous of me!

42:29.043 --> 42:30.206
Because I was made leader,

42:30.208 --> 42:32.240
they cut my hair
and had people beat me up.

42:32.242 --> 42:34.106
How can I put up with it?

42:34.108 --> 42:35.073
You want me to put up with it.

42:35.075 --> 42:37.073
Then what's the point
of practicing martial arts?

42:37.075 --> 42:39.907
- Shut your mouth!
- Mr. Wan.

42:39.909 --> 42:41.473
Your daughter was bullied.

42:41.475 --> 42:43.208
It's not wrong
to defend herself.

42:47.709 --> 42:49.407
Master Ip.

42:49.409 --> 42:50.542
As I've told you before,

42:52.509 --> 42:55.742
you don't understand
since you don't live here.

42:56.842 --> 42:57.742
Let me tell you.

42:59.609 --> 43:00.709
We live here.

43:02.275 --> 43:03.809
This is our home.

43:05.742 --> 43:09.340
Those people keep trying
to get rid of us.

43:09.342 --> 43:11.542
They even want
to get rid of Chinatown.

43:12.776 --> 43:14.373
Don't you understand?

43:14.375 --> 43:15.974
Have you tried
to get out of Chinatown

43:15.976 --> 43:19.275
to communicate with them
directly, to fight for a change?

43:25.108 --> 43:26.309
Are you preaching me now?

43:30.642 --> 43:31.542
Yonah.

43:32.943 --> 43:33.842
You can change too.

43:39.909 --> 43:40.809
Ip Man.

43:44.676 --> 43:47.609
If you want your letter,
don't use my daughter.

43:48.676 --> 43:50.475
Show me what you've got.

43:51.342 --> 43:52.509
Let's have a match.

45:13.075 --> 45:14.140
What happened?

45:14.142 --> 45:15.409
Old wound?

46:57.175 --> 46:59.106
Yonah! Yonah!

46:59.108 --> 47:01.509
- Are you all right?
- Dad, I am fine.

47:18.976 --> 47:20.442
Yonah. Yonah!

47:21.642 --> 47:22.709
Yonah.

47:23.876 --> 47:25.307
Dad.

47:26.609 --> 47:27.509
I am here.

47:28.242 --> 47:29.342
I am fine.

47:38.242 --> 47:41.409
ALL CHINESE ARE ONE BIG FAMILY

47:42.009 --> 47:44.041
Ip Man.

47:44.043 --> 47:46.373
It looks like we'll have to wait
until the Mid-Autumn Festival

47:46.375 --> 47:47.776
to decide who's the winner.

47:51.442 --> 47:54.842
Winning or losing,
does it really matter?

47:56.475 --> 47:59.206
Shouldn't we use
Chinese martial arts

47:59.208 --> 48:01.742
to change the biases against us?

48:07.776 --> 48:10.208
I brought Yonah back
because I wanted to protect her.

48:13.976 --> 48:15.208
I'm not here for the letter.

48:41.709 --> 48:44.106
You are always right
and I am always wrong.

48:44.108 --> 48:45.707
You are never supportive of me.

48:45.709 --> 48:46.607
If Mom was still alive,

48:46.609 --> 48:48.242
she would have...

49:15.475 --> 49:16.874
- Hello?
- <i>US Trunk Line.</i>

49:16.876 --> 49:19.106
Yes, collect call, please.

49:19.108 --> 49:21.240
Hey, hey, hey, Master Ip.

49:21.242 --> 49:22.576
- Bob.
- <i>Yes.</i>

49:23.809 --> 49:24.740
Where's Ching?

49:24.742 --> 49:27.240
He went out to buy
some late-night snacks.

49:27.242 --> 49:29.407
Right, how are things
getting on with you?

49:29.409 --> 49:30.709
<i>Is it going well?</i>

49:31.208 --> 49:32.375
Mm...

49:33.409 --> 49:35.073
There's a bit of a hiccup.

49:35.075 --> 49:37.440
It might take a few more days
before I can return.

49:37.442 --> 49:41.140
Back in a few days?
That's very good.

49:41.142 --> 49:43.974
Good luck. Be safe.

49:43.976 --> 49:45.309
Thanks a lot.

49:47.509 --> 49:49.576
- Bye bye.
- <i>Okay, bye bye.</i>

50:01.776 --> 50:04.707
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:04.709 --> 50:07.674
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:07.676 --> 50:10.674
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:10.676 --> 50:13.440
- To the left, right!
- To the left, right!

50:13.442 --> 50:16.707
- To the left, right!
- To the left, right!

50:16.709 --> 50:19.740
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:19.742 --> 50:23.273
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:23.275 --> 50:25.840
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:25.842 --> 50:28.774
- Left, right!
- Left, right!

50:28.776 --> 50:31.407
Pick up the pace, devil dogs!

50:31.409 --> 50:33.140
You are warriors.

50:33.142 --> 50:35.140
You are killing machines.

50:35.142 --> 50:37.206
Earn it like you got a pair.

50:37.208 --> 50:39.206
Kick that bag, boy!

50:39.208 --> 50:41.407
Wear that EGA with pride!

50:41.409 --> 50:44.173
Get the banana
out of the tailpipe!

50:44.175 --> 50:46.407
Move it! Move it! Move it!

50:46.409 --> 50:48.407
You gotta earn it, devil dog!

50:48.409 --> 50:49.941
Move it! Move it! Move it!

50:52.842 --> 50:54.208
Move!

50:59.709 --> 51:01.440
I surrender, sensei!

51:01.442 --> 51:03.407
What did you just say?

51:03.409 --> 51:06.473
Did I just hear you say
that you surrender?

51:06.475 --> 51:07.540
Did I?

51:07.542 --> 51:09.941
You know what
our motto is, recruit!

51:09.943 --> 51:12.373
Trained to kill! Ready to die!

51:12.375 --> 51:14.907
Do you understand the meaning
of those words?

51:14.909 --> 51:18.273
- It's hurting me, sir!
- Oh, it's hurting you, is it?

51:18.275 --> 51:20.640
Hurting you. You know,
this is the problem.

51:20.642 --> 51:23.507
You know there is a rumor
going around this base,

51:23.509 --> 51:25.307
people saying that I'm racist.

51:25.309 --> 51:26.874
I'm not racist.

51:26.876 --> 51:29.707
See, I don't hate you
because you're colored.

51:29.709 --> 51:32.974
I hate you because
you're a cowardly colored!

51:34.576 --> 51:38.142
- Get off the mat!
- You, Jackson. You're next.

51:41.642 --> 51:45.640
Staff Sergeant Hartman,
do you mind explaining to me

51:45.642 --> 51:49.409
what exactly
this contraption is?

51:50.309 --> 51:51.774
It's a Wing Chun dummy.

51:51.776 --> 51:55.041
A kung fu training aid, like
a punching bag, if you will,

51:55.043 --> 51:57.140
but for Chinese martial arts.

51:58.943 --> 52:00.874
Let me ask you something.

52:00.876 --> 52:03.473
Did you fall out of your crib
this morning

52:03.475 --> 52:04.941
and bang your little head?

52:04.943 --> 52:07.106
Where the hell
do you think you are?

52:07.108 --> 52:08.774
Does this look like a museum

52:08.776 --> 52:13.106
for preserving your ancient
Chinese heritage?

52:13.108 --> 52:16.073
Wing Chun is improvising
and adapting,

52:16.075 --> 52:17.674
just like a Marine.

52:17.676 --> 52:19.206
I've been practicing
for months now,

52:19.208 --> 52:21.640
and I find it practical
for real combat.

52:21.642 --> 52:24.407
I'm certain the practicing it
will be beneficial

52:24.409 --> 52:26.173
for Marines on the battleground.

52:26.175 --> 52:27.907
Oh, you're certain, are you?

52:27.909 --> 52:31.240
So this kung fu bullshit's gonna
allow us to kill our enemies?

52:31.242 --> 52:32.840
Is that what you're
trying to say?

52:32.842 --> 52:34.440
Outstanding, Staff Sergeant.

52:34.442 --> 52:36.273
You're a goddamn genius.

52:36.275 --> 52:39.173
Get this thing off my base now.

52:39.175 --> 52:41.342
You know nothing
of Chinese kung fu.

52:42.842 --> 52:44.175
Zero!

52:49.208 --> 52:51.173
All right,
Staff Sergeant Hartman,

52:51.175 --> 52:53.607
I'm gonna allow you
to prove those words.

52:53.609 --> 52:56.307
If you can defeat Colin
in a fair fight,

52:56.309 --> 52:57.473
then I'll consider,

52:57.475 --> 52:59.707
maybe allowing
your wooden girlfriend

52:59.709 --> 53:01.007
to stay on the base.

53:01.009 --> 53:02.442
Is that understood?

53:30.409 --> 53:32.342
Come on, Colin. Smack him up.

53:49.142 --> 53:52.140
Outstanding work.

53:52.142 --> 53:54.206
Very nice.

53:54.208 --> 53:56.041
You see this, men?

53:56.043 --> 53:59.440
Now this is karate.

53:59.442 --> 54:02.574
Your Chinese kung fu is only
good for folding laundry.

54:02.576 --> 54:06.842
It stays where it belongs and
that is the hell off my base.

54:08.509 --> 54:12.540
Now, because of
the Staff Sergeant's stupidity,

54:12.542 --> 54:16.041
all you Chinese will run
an extra 30 laps today.

54:16.043 --> 54:21.774
And the Staff Sergeant himself
will run an extra 30 after that.

54:21.776 --> 54:23.108
Are we clear?

54:25.142 --> 54:26.442
Good.

54:28.043 --> 54:29.375
Carry on.

54:35.175 --> 54:37.907
One, two, three, four!

54:37.909 --> 54:40.407
One, two, three, four!

54:40.409 --> 54:42.941
One, two, three, four!

54:42.943 --> 54:45.440
One, two, three, four!

54:45.442 --> 54:49.507
Left and right and <i>lei ho!</i>

54:49.509 --> 54:51.874
Left and right and <i>lei ho!</i>

54:51.876 --> 54:53.607
Left and right and <i>lei ho!</i>

55:09.375 --> 55:10.974
Mr. Ip.

55:10.976 --> 55:13.142
- I have great news for you.
- What's up, Yonah?

55:18.409 --> 55:19.475
Mm.

55:24.409 --> 55:25.375
Mm?

55:35.043 --> 55:36.540
Did you forge the signature?

55:36.542 --> 55:39.206
Don't worry, it looks
the same as Dad's.

55:39.208 --> 55:40.609
I am sure no one will notice.

55:42.375 --> 55:44.807
I don't understand what you kids
are thinking nowadays.

55:44.809 --> 55:48.106
You guys act without
thinking about the consequences.

55:48.108 --> 55:51.409
What are you doing?
It took me a lot of effort.

55:58.909 --> 56:02.707
Did it cross your mind that
your dad would be very upset?

56:02.709 --> 56:05.674
I don't care. He doesn't care
if I'm happy anyway.

56:05.676 --> 56:07.106
Why do you say that?

56:07.108 --> 56:08.874
I think he cares about you.

56:08.876 --> 56:10.240
He only cares about himself.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.507
He always pushes me
to practice Tai Chi

56:11.509 --> 56:13.240
and to perform
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

56:13.242 --> 56:14.840
Just because he likes it.

56:14.842 --> 56:15.742
But I don't.

56:20.709 --> 56:23.874
If you don't like Tai Chi,
just tell him.

56:23.876 --> 56:26.407
I did. He wouldn't listen.

56:26.409 --> 56:28.106
In his eyes,
everything I do is wrong.

56:28.108 --> 56:30.574
I fight back when I'm
being bullied, it's my fault.

56:30.576 --> 56:32.874
I like cheerleading and dancing,
it's my fault.

56:32.876 --> 56:35.941
I am always wrong.
He never supports me.

56:35.943 --> 56:37.842
I don't believe
that's how other dads are like.

56:38.742 --> 56:39.642
At the very least,

56:40.342 --> 56:41.676
you are not, Mr. Ip.

56:59.842 --> 57:05.242
Is cheerleading your passion?

57:09.142 --> 57:10.540
Not really.

57:10.542 --> 57:13.273
I do it because I like it.

57:13.275 --> 57:14.640
Mr. Ip, you are
so good at fighting.

57:14.642 --> 57:16.309
Isn't it because
you like martial arts?

57:19.842 --> 57:23.240
Ah! At the Mid-Autumn Festival,

57:23.242 --> 57:25.574
why don't you do
your cheerleading dance?

57:25.576 --> 57:28.240
Right, why haven't I
thought about that?

57:28.242 --> 57:29.874
That's a great idea.

57:29.876 --> 57:31.375
Mr. Ip, will you come?

57:32.075 --> 57:33.473
Sure.

57:33.475 --> 57:34.809
Great.

57:36.108 --> 57:38.375
- Now go to school.
- Okay.

57:42.776 --> 57:43.842
Off you go.

57:47.442 --> 57:48.709
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

58:05.375 --> 58:06.674
You finally decided
to come back, then,

58:06.676 --> 58:07.574
Andrew, thank you.

58:07.576 --> 58:09.440
I was in Washington DC,
Gabrielle.

58:09.442 --> 58:10.840
I came back as soon as I could.
How's Becky?

58:10.842 --> 58:13.607
She was almost disfigured
by a Chinese girl at school.

58:13.609 --> 58:14.774
And I don't
understand the grounds

58:14.776 --> 58:17.674
they let a Chinese student
in anyway.

58:17.676 --> 58:19.574
What do you intend
to do about it?

58:19.576 --> 58:21.842
What are the INS going to do
about those Chinese savages?

58:23.108 --> 58:25.409
Get rid of them. Send them home!

58:28.242 --> 58:30.140
Becky, honey, who...
who did this to you?

58:30.142 --> 58:32.574
Yonah Wan.

58:32.576 --> 58:33.874
She's the daughter
of the Chairman

58:33.876 --> 58:37.475
of the Chinese
"Benelovent" Association,

58:38.142 --> 58:39.640
or so she claims.

58:39.642 --> 58:40.676
Chinatown.

58:44.375 --> 58:45.742
I'll handle this.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.173
Really impressive.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.574
- So this is Chinese kung fu?
- Yes, sir.

59:07.576 --> 59:10.007
It's really amazing.
I mean really amazing.

59:10.009 --> 59:11.507
Thank you, sir.

59:11.509 --> 59:13.674
This brochure has
a brief introduction

59:13.676 --> 59:16.108
and here is the transcript
that I've prepared.

59:17.043 --> 59:17.941
Actually, sir,

59:17.943 --> 59:20.206
there's a martial arts event
taking place in Chinatown

59:20.208 --> 59:21.373
during the Full Moon Festival.

59:21.375 --> 59:22.473
With your permission,

59:22.475 --> 59:24.273
I'd like to go film it
and do some more research

59:24.275 --> 59:26.273
so that we may further
investigate this matter.

59:26.275 --> 59:27.774
- Chinatown?
- Yes, sir.

59:27.776 --> 59:28.807
Granted.

59:28.809 --> 59:30.307
Just don't make this
a waste of my time.

59:30.309 --> 59:32.473
- Definitely not, sir.
- All right.

59:32.475 --> 59:34.108
Come in.

59:37.509 --> 59:38.640
Sir.

59:38.642 --> 59:41.140
Please excuse
the Staff Sergeant's intrusion.

59:41.142 --> 59:42.907
What the hell
are you doing here?

59:42.909 --> 59:45.007
My job, as a Marine.

59:45.009 --> 59:46.273
So that's all right.

59:46.275 --> 59:48.373
So let's start
to explore the idea

59:48.375 --> 59:50.707
of incorporating Chinese kung fu

59:50.709 --> 59:52.907
into our hand to hand
combat training.

59:52.909 --> 59:54.540
Now, Staff Sergeant Hartman

59:54.542 --> 59:58.307
is gonna go to Chinatown
for research.

59:58.309 --> 59:59.373
I'd like you to start learning

59:59.375 --> 01:00:01.574
something from this handbook.

01:00:01.576 --> 01:00:02.742
Here, take it.

01:00:06.576 --> 01:00:09.475
- Gentlemen, that's all.
- Sir.

01:00:27.475 --> 01:00:29.240
Fix your base, recruit.

01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:33.809
You have no power, Mr. Creese.

01:00:35.142 --> 01:00:36.275
Instructor!

01:00:37.409 --> 01:00:38.442
A word.

01:00:41.142 --> 01:00:42.475
Bow.

01:00:44.609 --> 01:00:45.507
Gunny?

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:47.574
You know there is not a doubt
in my mind

01:00:47.576 --> 01:00:51.373
that karate is the best form of
hand to hand combat. Bar none.

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:53.640
But do you know what that
backstabbing son of a bitch

01:00:53.642 --> 01:00:55.974
- Hartman's gone and done?
- Tell me.

01:00:55.976 --> 01:00:59.707
Convinced our commanding officer
that his bullshit kung fu

01:00:59.709 --> 01:01:02.073
is more effective
than our karate training.

01:01:03.475 --> 01:01:05.440
I'm gonna need you to right
that wrong, Colin.

01:01:05.442 --> 01:01:06.707
You just let me show
those people

01:01:06.709 --> 01:01:08.774
the meaning
of real combat karate

01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:11.941
and I'll shut those
kung fu charlatans up for good.

01:01:11.943 --> 01:01:14.442
- Good, man.
- Gunny.

01:01:16.709 --> 01:01:18.309
Continue.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:22.007
Move!

01:01:42.842 --> 01:01:44.108
- Good.
- Good.

01:01:49.842 --> 01:01:50.776
- Good.
- Good.

01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:05.106
Grandmaster.

01:02:05.108 --> 01:02:06.676
More! More!

01:02:10.075 --> 01:02:12.173
Oh! Mm!

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:13.642
I loved it!

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.907
Mr. Ip, you are late.

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:27.674
I saved you a seat
next to the masters over there.

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:30.140
No worries.
I'll stay where I am.

01:02:30.142 --> 01:02:32.807
But the view is better there.

01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:36.442
How about you go back
and get ready to perform, okay?

01:02:36.909 --> 01:02:38.774
Go on.

01:02:38.776 --> 01:02:40.375
All right. I'll go, then.

01:02:42.742 --> 01:02:44.707
- Mr. Gwai.
- Uh.

01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:45.707
Huh?

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:47.140
That's how you're dressed
for stage?

01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:48.373
Yes.

01:02:48.375 --> 01:02:50.407
Where's your dad?
Didn't you come with your dad?

01:02:50.409 --> 01:02:52.140
No, I came first.
I didn't see him.

01:02:52.142 --> 01:02:53.842
- Maybe he will show up later.
- Ah.

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:19.108
TO MASTER IP

01:03:27.342 --> 01:03:29.709
Mr. Wan Zhong Hua.

01:03:32.043 --> 01:03:33.073
We're the United States
Department

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.707
of Immigration and Customs.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.640
We're here to take you
under custody for questioning

01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:38.507
regarding the presence
of illegal aliens

01:03:38.509 --> 01:03:41.309
residing in Chinatown.

01:03:48.776 --> 01:03:49.776
Go.

01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:51.809
Go.

01:03:54.943 --> 01:03:56.509
Go.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:03:58.542
Go.

01:04:01.409 --> 01:04:03.607
- Good.
- Good.

01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:04.674
Good.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.473
Good.

01:04:07.475 --> 01:04:09.206
- They're my students.
- Good.

01:04:19.043 --> 01:04:20.807
When did we invite
these white people to perform?

01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:21.709
I don't know.

01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:25.576
- Who are they?
- Who invited them?

01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:32.309
Get down from there!

01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:35.275
Scram!

01:04:35.943 --> 01:04:37.173
Get lost!

01:04:37.175 --> 01:04:39.409
- Get down!
- Leave!

01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:44.640
Hey, Chinaman!

01:04:44.642 --> 01:04:47.574
You wanna try to break
these bricks with your kung fu?

01:04:47.576 --> 01:04:48.475
Huh?

01:04:50.976 --> 01:04:52.075
Cowards.

01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:00.509
- Go away.
- Go away.

01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:02.809
Scram!

01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:22.509
I'll go and look for your dad.

01:05:24.342 --> 01:05:26.840
My name is Colin Frater.

01:05:26.842 --> 01:05:29.375
Fourth Dan black belt
in Kyokutan Karate.

01:05:30.475 --> 01:05:32.807
And I'm here to show you
yellow bitches

01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:35.507
the taste of real combat.

01:05:35.509 --> 01:05:39.640
Fight me with your
hokey-pokey kung fu.

01:05:39.642 --> 01:05:40.640
I dare you.

01:05:40.642 --> 01:05:43.607
- What are you talking about?
- Get down!

01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:45.007
Screw you!

01:05:45.009 --> 01:05:46.309
I will fight you now!

01:05:47.976 --> 01:05:49.340
- Eh, eh.
- Huh?

01:05:49.342 --> 01:05:51.774
Mr. Gwai, what happened
to Mr. Wan?

01:05:51.776 --> 01:05:53.240
What do you mean by that?

01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:55.507
I just saw
some immigration officers

01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:58.206
- take Mr. Wan into a car.
- Huh?

01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.473
Let's make it quick.

01:05:59.475 --> 01:06:01.307
You understand
I will go all out?

01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:03.607
You are begging to be killed.

01:06:03.609 --> 01:06:05.842
- Come on, then.
- I won't hold back either.

01:06:13.576 --> 01:06:15.073
- Master Law.
- Master Law.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:16.640
Are you okay?

01:06:16.642 --> 01:06:17.776
- Master Law.
- Master Law.

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:23.273
Bullshit, why is the stage
so small?

01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:25.507
- Be careful.
- Help me.

01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:27.974
- Who's next?
- Freaking yankee!

01:06:27.976 --> 01:06:29.307
- I'm in.
- Good.

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:30.640
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:06:30.642 --> 01:06:32.309
- Go!
- Master!

01:06:37.108 --> 01:06:38.208
Master!

01:06:50.776 --> 01:06:52.907
- Be careful!
- Master!

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.540
- Master!
- Master!

01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.273
- Master.
- Master.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:06:59.473
- Master.
- Master.

01:06:59.475 --> 01:07:01.709
- Master Chiu.
- Master Chiu, are you okay?

01:07:02.576 --> 01:07:04.342
Help him first.

01:07:14.509 --> 01:07:16.242
Lady, I'll show you no mercy.

01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:19.340
Don't hold back.

01:07:19.342 --> 01:07:21.208
Mind yourself first.

01:07:32.275 --> 01:07:33.340
- Master Chiang.
- Master Chiang.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:34.574
- Master Chiang.
- Master!

01:07:34.576 --> 01:07:37.142
- Beat him, Master Chiang.
- Beat him!

01:07:51.342 --> 01:07:53.676
- Get up!
- Master!

01:07:57.976 --> 01:07:59.842
- Master!
- You can do it!

01:08:13.642 --> 01:08:14.542
Enough.

01:08:20.442 --> 01:08:22.041
- Bravo!
- Master Ip, bravo.

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:24.173
- Bravo!
- Master Ip, bravo!

01:08:24.175 --> 01:08:25.573
Come on, Mr. Ip!

01:08:25.576 --> 01:08:28.273
- Master Ip!
- Master Ip!

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.307
- Master Ip!
- Master Ip!

01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:30.509
All the best, Master Ip!

01:09:56.842 --> 01:09:58.108
Great, Master Ip!

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:05.542
Yes! Yes!

01:10:07.909 --> 01:10:09.440
Sensei.

01:10:09.442 --> 01:10:10.941
- Help him out.
- Sensei.

01:10:10.943 --> 01:10:12.676
All right, here we go.

01:10:15.842 --> 01:10:17.540
Mr. Ip, that was fantastic!

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:18.907
Mr. Ip, you are the best!

01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:20.740
The best!

01:10:20.742 --> 01:10:23.206
That was amazing!
The most amazing Mr. Ip!

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.240
Woo! Woohoo! Woo!

01:10:26.242 --> 01:10:28.242
Yonah! Yonah!

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.674
I have bad news. Ms San told me

01:10:31.676 --> 01:10:34.407
your dad was taken
by the immigration officers.

01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:36.373
- Huh?
- I'll drive you there.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.542
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:46.907
We've reopened the
cases involving the CBA.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.640
We suspect that these Chinamen

01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:51.974
have identities
that are fraudulent

01:10:51.976 --> 01:10:53.540
and that you've helped them

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:57.340
by writing falsified letters
of referral from the USA,

01:10:57.342 --> 01:11:01.275
making you an accomplice
of these illegal aliens.

01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:03.740
This is a setup!

01:11:03.742 --> 01:11:04.842
Would you know?

01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:11.707
I'm going to arrest
every single person

01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:14.974
in the CBA tonight.

01:11:14.976 --> 01:11:21.309
You and the CBA
will be gone for good.

01:11:29.509 --> 01:11:32.206
He has a broken rib
but he will be okay.

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.740
Chinese kung fu my ass.

01:11:33.742 --> 01:11:35.742
I'll shut them down
in my own way.

01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:46.941
The Full Moon
event has concluded.

01:11:46.943 --> 01:11:48.173
Those Chinamen must be back

01:11:48.175 --> 01:11:51.340
at the Chinese
Benevolent Association.

01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:54.206
Thirty minutes to CBA.
Bring them all in.

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:56.240
Call the wives, boys.

01:11:56.242 --> 01:11:57.807
We're staying late.

01:11:57.809 --> 01:11:59.273
We're going to Chinatown,

01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:01.874
arresting every Chinamen
in the CBA.

01:12:01.876 --> 01:12:03.907
This operation
makes no sense, sir.

01:12:03.909 --> 01:12:05.242
Shut up, do-good marshal.

01:12:06.142 --> 01:12:07.442
Do as you're told.

01:12:15.442 --> 01:12:17.440
Mr. Ip.

01:12:17.442 --> 01:12:20.507
Excuse me. Anybody here?
I need some help.

01:12:20.509 --> 01:12:22.609
- What now?
- Let me check it out.

01:12:24.576 --> 01:12:26.440
Whoa, it's way past office
hours. You can't be here.

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.106
My father, Wan Zhong Hua
has been taken by mistake.

01:12:29.108 --> 01:12:30.640
I need to see him right now.

01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:32.007
- Billy.
- I can't let you in.

01:12:32.009 --> 01:12:33.874
- Grandmaster.
- Billy.

01:12:33.876 --> 01:12:35.707
- Can you help us?
- I wish I could.

01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:39.307
Her father, Mr. Wan Zhong Hua,
what happened?

01:12:39.309 --> 01:12:41.874
I have no idea, sir.
But please take my advice.

01:12:41.876 --> 01:12:44.707
Stay away from the Chinese
Benevolent Association tonight.

01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:45.807
Tonight, don't go there.

01:12:45.809 --> 01:12:48.407
All right? We're gonna raid
that place tonight.

01:12:48.409 --> 01:12:51.275
I gotta go. But remember,
don't go there.

01:13:07.442 --> 01:13:08.407
Masters.

01:13:08.409 --> 01:13:10.941
Who incited those karate guys
to come here?

01:13:10.943 --> 01:13:12.907
They made a scene for no reason.

01:13:12.909 --> 01:13:15.007
It must be Bruce Lee.

01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:16.607
He dragged us into this.

01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:19.307
Don't make
false assumptions.

01:13:19.309 --> 01:13:20.874
His master helped us.

01:13:25.142 --> 01:13:26.674
Hello.

01:13:26.676 --> 01:13:29.007
Master Law, leave
the CBA right now.

01:13:29.009 --> 01:13:30.607
<i>The immigration</i>

01:13:30.609 --> 01:13:31.609
- <i>is coming to make arrests.</i>
- Who are you?

01:13:34.642 --> 01:13:38.740
- Is that you?
- What are you saying?

01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:40.440
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:13:40.442 --> 01:13:42.142
Hello?

01:13:42.676 --> 01:13:43.676
Bad news.

01:14:01.309 --> 01:14:02.907
Is that it?

01:14:02.909 --> 01:14:04.974
Is this your Chinese kung fu?

01:14:04.976 --> 01:14:06.041
Huh?

01:14:06.043 --> 01:14:07.907
What about this guy?

01:14:07.909 --> 01:14:10.140
Your chairman, hey! Where is he?

01:14:10.142 --> 01:14:11.640
I don't know!

01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:13.574
You tell me
or I'm gonna break your arm.

01:14:13.576 --> 01:14:15.106
Ah!

01:14:15.108 --> 01:14:16.774
Ah!

01:14:16.776 --> 01:14:19.607
INS. Immigration.

01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:20.842
Good boy.

01:14:32.909 --> 01:14:34.142
What happened?

01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:35.642
Master Law.

01:14:37.676 --> 01:14:38.874
Master Ip.

01:14:38.876 --> 01:14:41.407
A yankee just showed up
and attacked everyone

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:42.907
like he was coming for revenge.

01:14:42.909 --> 01:14:45.642
Mr. Ip, the immigration
officers will be here soon.

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:01.574
They're gone.

01:15:01.576 --> 01:15:03.007
Check in back.

01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:05.073
All right, guys,
let's get a sweep.

01:15:05.075 --> 01:15:07.542
Looking for any clues that
might tell us where they went.

01:15:30.242 --> 01:15:31.707
Officer.

01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:34.640
I'm looking for a Chinaman
by the name of Wan Zhong Hua.

01:15:34.642 --> 01:15:36.473
Where is he?

01:15:36.475 --> 01:15:38.242
Uh, what do you want with him?

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:41.240
I'm Gunnery Sergeant
Barton Geddes,

01:15:41.242 --> 01:15:43.373
Second Battalion, Fifth Marines.

01:15:43.375 --> 01:15:47.540
One of my men was assaulted
in Chinatown tonight.

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:50.073
Wan Zhong Hua is the chairman

01:15:50.075 --> 01:15:51.473
of the Chinese
Benevolent Association.

01:15:51.475 --> 01:15:53.776
I need him back
on my base tonight.

01:15:56.142 --> 01:15:57.807
This man made me look bad.

01:15:57.809 --> 01:15:58.842
It's personal.

01:16:00.108 --> 01:16:01.540
So why don't you cooperate

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:03.140
or things are gonna get
pretty bad for you too.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:04.674
Do you understand?

01:16:04.676 --> 01:16:05.807
So go and get him

01:16:05.809 --> 01:16:07.776
and I'll worry
about the repercussions.

01:16:10.742 --> 01:16:11.676
Follow me.

01:16:21.609 --> 01:16:24.242
You're now officially in the
custody of the US Marines.

01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:26.607
Just don't let him stay
in the country

01:16:26.609 --> 01:16:27.674
when you're done
with him, all right?

01:16:27.676 --> 01:16:30.275
My karate coach was defeated
in a fight tonight

01:16:31.142 --> 01:16:32.776
by Chinese kung fu.

01:16:34.876 --> 01:16:37.073
Since you're the representative
of Chinese kung fu,

01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:39.075
I'm holding you
personally accountable.

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:42.206
These Chinamen right here,

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:44.941
I just crushed all of them.

01:16:44.943 --> 01:16:47.041
You're the only one left.

01:16:47.043 --> 01:16:48.574
I need to fight you.

01:16:48.576 --> 01:16:49.540
Dad.

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:51.273
What are you
doing here? Get out of here!

01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:53.173
You're Becky's father, right?

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:55.273
Listen, it's all my fault.

01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:57.173
It's nothing to do
with my father.

01:16:57.175 --> 01:16:58.874
I'm sorry.

01:16:58.876 --> 01:17:00.407
I beg you.

01:17:00.409 --> 01:17:02.273
Please let my papa go.

01:17:02.275 --> 01:17:04.108
Please. Please.

01:17:04.742 --> 01:17:05.676
Yonah.

01:17:07.475 --> 01:17:08.542
Get up!

01:17:10.509 --> 01:17:11.409
Yonah!

01:17:15.943 --> 01:17:17.842
Get up!

01:17:19.909 --> 01:17:21.742
Don't kneel to these people.

01:17:30.776 --> 01:17:31.776
You are right.

01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:36.609
If you can't take it anymore,
then just don't.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:52.676
I will fight you.

01:17:55.943 --> 01:17:56.842
Let's go.

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:00.742
Dad, don't.

01:18:11.142 --> 01:18:12.242
Bruce.

01:18:13.175 --> 01:18:14.275
Master.

01:18:22.776 --> 01:18:25.840
I want all recruits in the
PT Gauntlet straight away.

01:18:25.842 --> 01:18:26.740
Aye-aye, Gunny.

01:18:26.742 --> 01:18:29.642
Especially
Staff Sergeant Hartman.

01:18:31.475 --> 01:18:33.840
Reveille! Reveille!

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.874
Get your asses on the line!

01:18:35.876 --> 01:18:38.106
Move it! Move it! Move it!

01:18:38.108 --> 01:18:39.941
Out! Out! Out!

01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:41.640
Good!

01:18:41.642 --> 01:18:44.540
Move your asses, Marines!
Move it!

01:18:44.542 --> 01:18:47.874
Move that ass!
Double time! Double time!

01:18:47.876 --> 01:18:49.007
Left hand, left knee.

01:18:49.009 --> 01:18:51.007
Right hand, right knee.
Aye, sir.

01:18:51.009 --> 01:18:53.874
Sit down! Sit down! Move it!

01:18:53.876 --> 01:18:56.340
I try to be a fair man.

01:18:56.342 --> 01:18:58.473
So since
Staff Sergeant Hartman

01:18:58.475 --> 01:19:01.907
so desperately wants his
Chinese kung fu

01:19:01.909 --> 01:19:04.607
to be part of our curriculum,

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:07.674
I'm happy to give up
my rack time

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.874
and give a Chinese
representative

01:19:09.876 --> 01:19:11.173
the chance to prove

01:19:11.175 --> 01:19:16.776
their kung fu is actually useful
in a real combat situation.

01:19:18.742 --> 01:19:19.774
Master Wan.

01:19:19.776 --> 01:19:21.807
You don't have to accept
his challenge.

01:19:21.809 --> 01:19:22.742
I have to.

01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:27.242
If I back down,
I'm no longer Chinese.

01:19:33.976 --> 01:19:35.240
No rules.

01:19:35.242 --> 01:19:36.676
Fight till you drop.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:41.140
Make sure you get
all these on film.

01:19:41.142 --> 01:19:42.275
Sir, yes, sir!

01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:09.208
Master Wan, stop!

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.509
You know what I just realized?

01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:50.275
You and your daughter look
a hell of a lot alike...

01:22:52.809 --> 01:22:54.275
when you beg.

01:22:57.676 --> 01:22:58.809
Enough!

01:23:08.009 --> 01:23:09.676
Uh...

01:23:15.776 --> 01:23:17.073
Master Wan.

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:18.007
Master Wan.

01:23:18.009 --> 01:23:21.206
Don't you think
I deserve a round of applause?

01:23:35.075 --> 01:23:38.774
Those white people
always pick on our Chinatown.

01:23:38.776 --> 01:23:41.407
They made a scene tonight
at the association.

01:23:41.409 --> 01:23:43.307
They are getting way
out of line.

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:44.740
That's right.

01:23:44.742 --> 01:23:48.073
It's not the first time
the immigration officers came.

01:23:48.075 --> 01:23:50.142
They harassed us for no reason.

01:23:50.842 --> 01:23:52.507
Yes.

01:23:52.509 --> 01:23:56.140
My grandfather came here
as a hard labor worker.

01:23:56.142 --> 01:23:57.974
He helped them
build the railway.

01:23:57.976 --> 01:24:02.540
He helped the Americans connect
the east coast with the west.

01:24:02.542 --> 01:24:05.273
It's all thanks
to Chinese labor.

01:24:05.275 --> 01:24:06.740
Yet the American government

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:09.707
was never willing to acknowledge
our contribution.

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:12.407
They keep trying to kick us out
with all sorts of excuses.

01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:14.540
The white guys are too arrogant.

01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:16.275
There's no equality here.

01:24:16.943 --> 01:24:18.574
Bruce.

01:24:18.576 --> 01:24:20.373
- We were too...
- Hey.

01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:21.774
It's no big deal.

01:24:21.776 --> 01:24:23.774
I didn't take it to heart.
Don't worry.

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.507
Master Ip.

01:24:26.509 --> 01:24:28.640
- Thank you very much...
- Hey.

01:24:28.642 --> 01:24:29.807
Not at all.

01:24:29.809 --> 01:24:31.507
All of us are Chinese.

01:24:31.509 --> 01:24:33.507
We should help each other out.

01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:34.774
That has always
been my belief.

01:24:34.776 --> 01:24:36.340
Chinese people must help
each other out.

01:24:36.342 --> 01:24:37.907
Right? Right?

01:24:37.909 --> 01:24:38.807
- Yes.
- Spot on.

01:24:38.809 --> 01:24:40.273
- Master Law is right.
- He's right.

01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:43.275
Okay.

01:24:49.043 --> 01:24:51.540
- Hello.
- <i>Master.</i>

01:24:51.542 --> 01:24:52.974
At the Mid-Autumn
Festival tonight,

01:24:52.976 --> 01:24:53.907
the masters in Chinatown

01:24:53.909 --> 01:24:55.509
had a conflict
with people from the army.

01:24:56.642 --> 01:24:58.073
Master Wan is...

01:24:58.075 --> 01:24:59.740
He is severely injured.

01:24:59.742 --> 01:25:01.108
<i>He's now at the hospital.</i>

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:23.073
Little prick, you're
not answering the phone again!

01:26:23.075 --> 01:26:24.842
- Hello.
- Bob.

01:26:26.108 --> 01:26:27.340
Where is Ching?

01:26:27.342 --> 01:26:29.540
He is practicing
with the wooden dummy.

01:26:34.876 --> 01:26:37.842
Master Ip, long-distance
calls are expensive.

01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:41.475
Bob.

01:26:48.909 --> 01:26:50.108
I have cancer.

01:26:56.175 --> 01:26:58.874
Are you serious?

01:26:58.876 --> 01:27:01.175
Actually, the reason
I hurried to America...

01:27:03.776 --> 01:27:08.240
is to have a look here
and see if it's right for Ching.

01:27:08.242 --> 01:27:09.509
Please let me talk to him.

01:27:10.876 --> 01:27:11.776
Hold on.

01:27:14.509 --> 01:27:16.108
Your dad
is asking for you.

01:27:16.909 --> 01:27:17.842
Answer the phone.

01:27:18.842 --> 01:27:20.073
I won't take his call.

01:27:20.075 --> 01:27:21.142
<i>No way!</i>

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.874
Listen to me.

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:29.275
I will only say it once.

01:27:30.043 --> 01:27:31.509
Your dad has cancer.

01:27:34.742 --> 01:27:36.776
He went to America
just to find you a school.

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:54.576
- <i>Dad.</i>
- Ching.

01:28:01.108 --> 01:28:04.542
It was my fault
for hitting you last time.

01:28:07.642 --> 01:28:09.507
I am sorry.

01:28:09.509 --> 01:28:11.175
I know
you like martial arts.

01:28:12.043 --> 01:28:13.475
I will teach you when I'm back.

01:28:16.676 --> 01:28:17.576
Dad.

01:28:18.809 --> 01:28:20.242
<i>When will
you be home?</i>

01:28:22.642 --> 01:28:24.609
I still have something
to take care of.

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:29.409
Once it's done,
I will be right back.

01:28:33.242 --> 01:28:34.309
<i>Bye bye.</i>

01:29:01.342 --> 01:29:02.709
Take me to the boot camp.

01:29:10.876 --> 01:29:13.273
Mr. Ip, don't go.

01:29:13.275 --> 01:29:14.776
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:27.473
I'm a martial artist.

01:29:27.475 --> 01:29:30.809
In the face of injustice,
I must stand up and fight.

01:29:32.309 --> 01:29:34.242
That was why
we took up martial arts.

01:29:35.208 --> 01:29:38.273
This is something I want to do.

01:29:38.275 --> 01:29:40.375
Just like you want
to do cheerleading.

01:29:56.943 --> 01:29:59.907
If you're lucky enough
to come to America,

01:29:59.909 --> 01:30:01.640
<i>set foot on our soil,</i>

01:30:01.642 --> 01:30:05.674
then you ought to learn
everything about my culture.

01:30:05.676 --> 01:30:09.073
Consider yourselves incredibly
honored to be here.

01:30:09.075 --> 01:30:10.842
Incredibly honored!

01:30:12.075 --> 01:30:13.874
<i>'Cause America</i>

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:17.473
<i>is the greatest and most
powerful country on earth.</i>

01:30:17.475 --> 01:30:19.874
<i>Land of supremacy,</i>

01:30:19.876 --> 01:30:24.108
<i>and that
is an undisputable fact.</i>

01:30:25.876 --> 01:30:27.173
Is that understood?

01:30:27.175 --> 01:30:29.206
<i>Sir, yes, sir!</i>

01:30:33.375 --> 01:30:34.907
<i>But last night,</i>

01:30:34.909 --> 01:30:38.407
<i>I had the unfortunate
but necessary task</i>

01:30:38.409 --> 01:30:41.173
of demonstrating how
an inferior race

01:30:41.175 --> 01:30:44.307
can and should be defeated.

01:30:44.309 --> 01:30:48.842
I'm sure you will all agree the
<i>results were quite definitive.</i>

01:30:51.009 --> 01:30:53.640
So don't even think about
bringing your filthy cultures

01:30:53.642 --> 01:30:56.106
to my Marine corp again,
is that understood?

01:30:56.108 --> 01:30:57.776
Sir, yes, sir!

01:31:00.009 --> 01:31:01.442
Racist asshole!

01:31:02.242 --> 01:31:03.776
Look around you.

01:31:05.776 --> 01:31:07.409
We are the culture.

01:31:08.776 --> 01:31:11.442
Your supremacy
is pure hatred and bigotry.

01:31:12.442 --> 01:31:15.208
This, this is Master Ip Man.

01:31:19.275 --> 01:31:21.440
He defeated Colin last night.

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:25.309
And he's here to kick your ass!

01:31:27.576 --> 01:31:29.173
No rules.

01:31:29.175 --> 01:31:30.809
You fight till you drop.

01:33:33.809 --> 01:33:35.240
Is that it?

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:37.576
Huh? Is that all you've got?

01:33:41.009 --> 01:33:42.676
You see this?

01:33:46.275 --> 01:33:48.607
You're nothing but another
little yellow chink!

01:33:48.609 --> 01:33:49.642
Come on!

01:33:56.776 --> 01:33:58.509
Let's go!

01:34:00.609 --> 01:34:02.342
That's it.

01:35:46.475 --> 01:35:49.340
Take the Gunnery Sergeant
to Sick Bay.

01:35:49.342 --> 01:35:52.342
- Johnson! Harris!
- Move! Move! Move!

01:36:44.475 --> 01:36:46.576
ALL CHINESE ARE ONE BIG FAMILY

01:36:48.642 --> 01:36:50.273
Master Ip.

01:36:50.275 --> 01:36:53.840
This letter is a bit late.

01:36:53.842 --> 01:36:55.842
I am sorry
to have kept you waiting.

01:37:00.043 --> 01:37:01.473
I appreciate it.

01:37:01.475 --> 01:37:02.676
Hey...

01:37:03.642 --> 01:37:05.073
Right.

01:37:05.075 --> 01:37:07.475
When will you
and your son come here?

01:37:14.242 --> 01:37:15.842
Actually, the grass
is not really greener

01:37:17.043 --> 01:37:18.375
on the other side of the fence.

01:37:27.909 --> 01:37:29.607
Mr. Ip.

01:37:29.609 --> 01:37:32.574
I bought all the medicine
you asked for.

01:37:32.576 --> 01:37:34.840
I even got you
candies and chocolate.

01:37:34.842 --> 01:37:36.407
This is my favorite chocolate.

01:37:36.409 --> 01:37:38.206
Your son will love it too.

01:37:38.208 --> 01:37:39.407
Thank you.

01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:41.874
You're so thoughtful.

01:38:04.676 --> 01:38:06.073
Dad.

01:38:18.609 --> 01:38:20.407
<i>I have
thought it through.</i>

01:38:20.409 --> 01:38:21.475
<i>I don't want to
go to America.</i>

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.609
<i>I really like
martial arts.</i>

01:38:25.842 --> 01:38:26.709
<i>Dad.</i>

01:38:27.309 --> 01:38:28.509
<i>Teach me.</i>

01:38:29.976 --> 01:38:31.108
Okay.

01:38:33.142 --> 01:38:34.842
Self-confidence
is the most important thing,

01:38:35.842 --> 01:38:37.142
no matter where you are.

01:39:11.075 --> 01:39:12.175
Ching.

01:39:13.909 --> 01:39:15.275
I will demonstrate once.

01:39:16.943 --> 01:39:17.842
Film it.
