00:00.461 --> 00:03.401
Kids, there's more than one
story of I met your mother.

00:03.590 --> 00:05.409
You know the short version,

00:05.410 --> 00:07.288
the thing with your mom's
yellow umbrella.

00:07.289 --> 00:08.850
But there's a bigger story.

00:08.851 --> 00:10.981
The story of how I became
who I had to become

00:10.982 --> 00:12.804
before I could meet her.

00:12.805 --> 00:15.414
And that story begins here.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.725
...dary!

00:16.726 --> 00:18.287
Legendary!

00:18.288 --> 00:20.663
Dude, I am so excited
that you're single again.

00:20.664 --> 00:23.136
We are going to conquer
New York City.

00:23.137 --> 00:25.303
I already have a girl
from work lined up for you.

00:25.304 --> 00:27.064
Right boob bigger
than the left boob,

00:27.065 --> 00:28.952
which some choose to look
at as bra half empty,

00:28.953 --> 00:31.793
I choose to look
at as bra half full.

00:31.794 --> 00:32.977
I don't know.

00:32.978 --> 00:34.773
Robin and I broke up
two weeks ago.

00:34.774 --> 00:37.476
I'm... I'm not ready.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.344
When will you be ready?

00:39.345 --> 00:40.689
It was a good question.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.228
After a big relationship ends,

00:42.229 --> 00:43.680
you need some time
to recuperate.

00:43.681 --> 00:45.337
Robin took a trip to Argentina,

00:45.338 --> 00:47.532
and I went through
my usual routine.

00:47.533 --> 00:49.105
I grew my breakup beard.

00:49.106 --> 00:51.098
Ted Mosby, suit up,
'cause here's the plan.

00:51.099 --> 00:52.590
There's a Miss Nassau
County pageant.

00:52.591 --> 00:53.598
We'll pretend to be judges

00:53.599 --> 00:56.526
and, yes, our votes
are for sale.

00:56.527 --> 00:58.530
I'm not ready.

00:58.531 --> 00:59.746
I repainted the apartment.

00:59.747 --> 01:02.043
Finish Line of a women's 10K.

01:02.044 --> 01:03.903
Salty girls on
an endorphin high

01:03.904 --> 01:06.420
who just want to lie down.

01:06.421 --> 01:09.078
Yeah.
I'm not ready.

01:09.079 --> 01:11.388
And the truth is,
I was doing really good.

01:11.389 --> 01:13.704
Female acrobats
from Montreal.

01:13.705 --> 01:14.382
Hmm.

01:14.383 --> 01:15.674
Super flexible.
We are going to get

01:15.675 --> 01:17.423
Cirque de So-Laid.

01:17.424 --> 01:19.112
What up?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.162
Barney, come on,
we've covered this.

01:20.163 --> 01:20.955
Robin!

01:20.956 --> 01:22.087
Hey, guys.

01:22.088 --> 01:25.838
I just got in last night.

01:25.990 --> 01:28.461
Um, uh, this is Gael.

01:28.462 --> 01:30.321
Hola.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.002
Okay, I'm ready.

01:33.106 --> 01:36.864
Subsfactory presents:
How I Met Your Mother

01:36.954 --> 01:40.110
Season 3 Episode 1
"Wait For It"

01:40.135 --> 01:44.227
Synch by: redman

01:46.901 --> 01:48.535
I just can't believe her.

01:48.536 --> 01:50.367
We have this totally
amicable split,

01:50.368 --> 01:51.491
everything's cool.

01:51.492 --> 01:53.938
And she comes back
from vacation withthatguy?

01:53.939 --> 01:55.329
You know what she's doing?

01:55.330 --> 01:56.645
She's trying to win the breakup.

01:56.646 --> 02:00.378
What do you mean "win the
breakup," old-timey inventor?

02:00.379 --> 02:02.591
What our 21st president,
Chester A. Arthur,

02:02.592 --> 02:04.246
is trying to say is that

02:04.247 --> 02:06.673
in every breakup there are
winners and a losers.

02:06.674 --> 02:08.610
It's not a
competition.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.545
Now, your 80-day
balloon race around the world,

02:10.547 --> 02:13.206
that was a competion.

02:13.207 --> 02:14.795
That's my wife.

02:14.796 --> 02:16.594
Of course it's
a competition, Lil.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.467
How else do you explain...
what's his name?

02:19.468 --> 02:22.423
Gael.

02:22.424 --> 02:25.162
I'm sorry, Gayle?

02:25.163 --> 02:27.280
Gael.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.634
Kyle?

02:29.635 --> 02:32.115
Gael.

02:32.116 --> 02:35.566
Girl?

02:35.663 --> 02:38.113
It's pronounced "guy-el. "

02:38.114 --> 02:39.730
It means "joyful. "

02:39.731 --> 02:42.286
That is why I live
my life by bringing joy,

02:42.287 --> 02:46.199
good energy
and happiness to others.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.053
Especially those
less fortunate that I.

02:49.054 --> 02:51.507
I'm sorry, so it's Gayle?

02:51.508 --> 02:53.366
What a jerk.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.607
I don't go
to your stupid country

02:54.608 --> 02:57.555
and try to seduce women
with my sexy accent.

02:57.556 --> 03:01.021
That's a great point,
Persian nightclub owner.

03:01.022 --> 03:03.944
Oh, and he's a masseuse.

03:03.945 --> 03:07.417
With a massage,
everything is connected.

03:07.418 --> 03:11.012
I can touch your foot,
cleanse your kidney.

03:11.013 --> 03:12.805
I can touch
your earlobe,

03:12.806 --> 03:15.495
and slow your heartbeat.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.994
One time, I used warm water
to make a guy pee.

03:17.995 --> 03:20.418
Of course, I didn't
make a career out of it.

03:20.419 --> 03:21.985
Career?

03:21.986 --> 03:23.638
Such an American idea.

03:23.639 --> 03:26.979
My career is living.
Windsurfing.

03:26.980 --> 03:29.327
Making love.

03:29.328 --> 03:32.246
Sometimes at the same time.

03:32.247 --> 03:33.012
How?

03:33.013 --> 03:36.464
How would one do that exactly?

03:36.465 --> 03:38.746
Seriously, don't giggle.
Tell me.

03:38.747 --> 03:39.789
Not possible.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.262
You cannot have sex
on a windsurfing board.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.400
How do you know?
Glad you asked, Lily.

03:44.401 --> 03:47.197
I have crafted a list
of every vehicle...

03:47.198 --> 03:48.949
land-based, aquatic
and airborne...

03:48.950 --> 03:51.369
in which/on which it's
possible to have sex.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.292
And of those 33 vehicles,

03:53.293 --> 03:56.478
I have had sex in/on 31.

03:56.479 --> 03:59.391
Windsurfing board,
not on the list, not possible.

03:59.392 --> 04:01.620
Oh, P.S., in order
to hit 33, all I need is

04:01.621 --> 04:05.027
bobsled and the Apollo 11
space capsule.

04:05.028 --> 04:08.246
To get that last one, you'd have
to break into the Smithsonian.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.310
This conversation
never happened.

04:10.311 --> 04:14.028
All right, you're suited up,
I'm bearded down.

04:14.029 --> 04:15.168
Let's get out there
and win this thing.

04:15.169 --> 04:16.380
Yes!

04:16.380 --> 04:18.716
You guys, have fun
on your double date.

04:18.718 --> 04:21.423
Oh, for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry, there was a lull.

04:21.423 --> 04:23.562
And then we fell asleep
on the beach

04:23.563 --> 04:24.873
while counting the stars.

04:24.874 --> 04:29.134
Do you want to have
dinner with me? Uh, us?

04:29.177 --> 04:30.549
There was no lull.

04:30.550 --> 04:32.206
You just think
he's incredibly hot.

04:32.207 --> 04:33.773
No, I don't!

04:33.774 --> 04:36.735
Not incredibly.

04:36.736 --> 04:38.863
It's a little hard to believe
how hot he is.

04:38.864 --> 04:39.673
But, I mean,

04:39.674 --> 04:40.845
she's serious
about him.

04:40.846 --> 04:43.352
The girl never marries
the hot guy.

04:43.353 --> 04:44.727
Well, you did.

04:44.728 --> 04:47.346
I'm one of the lucky few.

04:47.347 --> 04:49.368
Lily, Ted is our best friend,

04:49.369 --> 04:50.572
so let's get something straight:

04:50.573 --> 04:53.175
Male Gayle is not hot.

04:53.176 --> 04:55.074
He's not our friend.
Don't even look at him.

04:55.075 --> 04:57.458
Just... no eye contact.

04:57.459 --> 04:58.960
So that night,
as Lily and Marshall

04:58.961 --> 05:00.490
did their best to hate Gael...

05:00.491 --> 05:03.395
Hey, Robin. Gael.

05:03.396 --> 05:05.616
...Robin pulled me aside
to check in.

05:05.617 --> 05:07.528
Now, I'm sure
she meant the best,

05:07.529 --> 05:09.606
but she said the worst.

05:09.607 --> 05:11.303
I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

05:11.304 --> 05:14.076
"I just want to make sure
you're okay with this"?

05:14.077 --> 05:15.619
Damn it! I can't
believe she's the one

05:15.620 --> 05:16.780
that gets to say that.

05:16.781 --> 05:18.400
She's winning, isn't she?

05:18.401 --> 05:19.494
Not for long.

05:19.495 --> 05:22.630
Okay, pep talk.
Take a knee.

05:22.631 --> 05:23.960
Ted, tonight we're going to get

05:23.961 --> 05:26.809
you someone way hotter
than Robin.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.711
Okay, Robin's a ten.

05:28.712 --> 05:30.389
Fine, we'll get you a 12.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.622
Or, you know...

05:32.623 --> 05:34.477
two sixes.

05:34.478 --> 05:36.289
Failing that, four threes.

05:36.290 --> 05:38.166
And break glass
in case of emergency,

05:38.167 --> 05:40.009
we'll go to Staten Island,
I'll get you 12 ones.

05:40.010 --> 05:44.240
Ted, my boy,
I am going to re-teach you...

05:45.043 --> 05:48.443
Amy.
Ted.

05:49.543 --> 05:52.893
Barney.

05:54.066 --> 05:56.131
Ted, we are back!

05:56.132 --> 05:59.269
Up here.

05:59.270 --> 06:01.161
Up high.

06:01.162 --> 06:04.852
Fivin' it up
five-style!

06:05.703 --> 06:07.267
I'm sorry this is
all so weird.

06:07.268 --> 06:08.906
Weird, why would it be weird?

06:08.907 --> 06:10.437
Because you used
to date our best friend

06:10.438 --> 06:12.600
or because my wife thinks

06:12.601 --> 06:14.551
your new boyfriend
is incredibly hot?

06:14.552 --> 06:16.550
I do not! Shut up!

06:16.551 --> 06:19.987
Oh, my God!

06:19.988 --> 06:21.470
I just hope Ted's okay.

06:21.471 --> 06:22.659
Hmm.

06:22.660 --> 06:25.642
I hate to see you so tense.

06:25.643 --> 06:28.456
I mean, we had a really
clean break up, you know?

06:28.457 --> 06:29.961
We really acted like adults,

06:29.962 --> 06:33.682
so the last thing... oh!

06:36.756 --> 06:39.556
Gael, are you a properly
licensed massage therapist?

06:39.557 --> 06:40.973
What?
Are you legally

06:40.974 --> 06:43.758
certified by some type
of governing entity?

06:43.759 --> 06:46.243
I train for three years at
an institute in Buenos Aires.

06:46.244 --> 06:48.436
I have a card.
I can show you.

06:48.437 --> 06:49.960
Is the card laminated?

06:49.961 --> 06:51.375
What do you mean "laminated"?

06:51.376 --> 06:53.625
Covered in protective plastic.

06:53.626 --> 06:56.117
Oh, yes.
Damn it.

06:56.118 --> 06:58.619
He checks out.

06:58.620 --> 07:03.627
Ted. Ted.

07:03.628 --> 07:06.857
What?!

07:06.858 --> 07:08.354
Let's bail, this
place is dead.

07:08.355 --> 07:09.219
Yeah, you're right.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.651
We're both totally striking out.

07:10.652 --> 07:12.026
Exactly, plus,

07:12.027 --> 07:14.343
we're on a tight schedule.
I've got this entire evening

07:14.344 --> 07:16.637
perfectly planned
out... spoiler alert:

07:16.638 --> 07:18.166
our last stop is
an after hours club

07:18.167 --> 07:20.771
so after hours, it's
three days from now.

07:20.772 --> 07:22.871
What up.

07:22.872 --> 07:23.859
Are you blind?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.907
I'm making out with a 12.
I am winning.

07:25.908 --> 07:27.670
Yeah, but I didn't get to help.

07:27.671 --> 07:28.900
So you're saying
you want me to throw away

07:28.901 --> 07:32.171
a super hot girl just because
you didn't help me get her?

07:32.172 --> 07:34.002
Apology accepted.
Let's go.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.517
Who's the suit?

07:35.518 --> 07:37.642
This is Barney.
Barney, Amy.

07:37.643 --> 07:39.016
I'm not gonna remember that.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.145
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

07:40.146 --> 07:41.953
random chick from
earlier tonight,

07:41.954 --> 07:43.892
as you shall
henceforth be known,

07:43.893 --> 07:45.630
Ted and I have a
schedule to keep.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.532
Oh, well, you can check off
8:54, dress up like a dork

07:48.533 --> 07:50.276
and bother the cool kids.

07:50.277 --> 07:52.063
Beat it, nerd.

07:52.064 --> 07:53.647
Wow. Wow.

07:53.648 --> 07:55.408
Great stuff, Tommy Lee.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.368
See, what you don't
understand is

07:56.369 --> 07:58.261
I'm Ted's wingman.

07:58.262 --> 08:00.174
It's a sacred bond,
much stronger than any...

08:00.175 --> 08:03.066
They're making out again.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.709
Massage therapist.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.588
And you know what, "Gayle"?

08:07.589 --> 08:11.920
Your piece of chicken
looks a little tense to me.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.816
Oh, oh, does that
feel good, Mr. Chicken?

08:14.817 --> 08:16.041
Well, guess what?

08:16.042 --> 08:18.538
I didn't wash my hands.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.809
Got him.

08:21.810 --> 08:23.256
Lily!

08:23.257 --> 08:25.341
We carry so much
ancient emotion

08:25.342 --> 08:27.149
in our neck
and shoulders.

08:27.150 --> 08:29.774
Things we should have
let go of years ago.

08:29.775 --> 08:33.345
I forgive you, Mom.

08:34.102 --> 08:36.261
Lily, we are Ted's
best friends.

08:36.263 --> 08:38.243
Our job is to hate that guy.

08:38.244 --> 08:40.432
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was doing.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.749
I was just building him up
so a few minutes later,

08:43.750 --> 08:47.620
I could totally cut him down.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.684
Weren't you wearing a bra?

08:52.685 --> 08:53.464
The night was going great.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.436
Amy was cool and dangerous.

08:55.437 --> 08:57.089
She found a friend for Barney.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.669
She even paid for drinks...

08:58.670 --> 09:01.067
sort of.

09:01.068 --> 09:02.294
They know us here.

09:02.295 --> 09:03.498
You're gonna get
us in trouble.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.484
Tell me something.

09:04.485 --> 09:05.972
Do you ask your tailor
to leave extra room

09:05.973 --> 09:09.993
in the crotch
for your huge vagina?

09:10.859 --> 09:14.489
You... your vagina...

09:15.908 --> 09:17.267
Ted, this chick is crazy.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.720
We're leaving.
Good idea.

09:18.721 --> 09:19.993
Let's all go back
to my place.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.408
Your place?
Thanks but no thanks,

09:22.409 --> 09:25.037
1994 Courtney Love.

09:25.038 --> 09:28.283
I have a hot tub.

09:28.284 --> 09:32.304
Okay, this is
actually pretty nice.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.588
I like your tatts.

09:35.589 --> 09:37.582
Thanks, you can play
with them if you want.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.103
They're a hundred
percent real.

09:40.104 --> 09:44.184
No, your tatts... toos,
your tattoos.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.734
Thanks.

09:46.735 --> 09:47.770
You should get one.

09:47.771 --> 09:50.911
Wrong. Ted has a classic,
clean-cut look

09:50.912 --> 09:54.974
that never goes out of style
season after season, burn.

09:54.975 --> 09:57.800
Yeah? Well, I think he
would look hot with some ink.

09:57.801 --> 09:59.634
No, he wouldn't.
Yes, he would.

09:59.635 --> 10:00.879
No, he wouldn't.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.197
Yuh-huh.
Nuh-uh.

10:03.198 --> 10:05.072
I'm ready to do anything
you want by the way.

10:05.073 --> 10:08.673
Anything. Right now.

10:09.039 --> 10:11.539
Ted, who are you gonna side
with on this tattoo thing?

10:11.540 --> 10:14.198
I think I'd look
way hot with some ink.

10:14.199 --> 10:17.829
Yeah, you would.
Yeah.

10:17.899 --> 10:19.649
Oh, my God!
Tyler?

10:19.650 --> 10:20.918
Mommy! Daddy!

10:20.919 --> 10:22.696
She's back!

10:22.697 --> 10:27.257
Damn it, they're supposed
to be in the Hamptons. Run!

10:28.625 --> 10:31.149
Sorry. I used to nanny

10:31.150 --> 10:32.823
for those jerks
before they fired me.

10:32.824 --> 10:34.529
So unfair.
Unfair?

10:34.530 --> 10:36.341
I wouldn't let you take care
of the imaginary kids

10:36.342 --> 10:38.923
I make up to score
with single moms.

10:38.924 --> 10:39.600
That's it, Ted.

10:39.601 --> 10:43.111
We're going home.

10:43.258 --> 10:45.303
Ted?

10:45.304 --> 10:47.226
Ted, you okay?

10:47.227 --> 10:49.403
Hello, Ted.
Robin and I are about to make

10:49.404 --> 10:52.198
fantastic aquatic sex
on this windsurfing board.

10:52.199 --> 10:56.699
And I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

10:58.666 --> 11:00.319
Okay, how do we do this?

11:00.320 --> 11:03.386
I think your leg
goes up, up...

11:03.387 --> 11:05.735
Okay, how about if I, um...

11:05.736 --> 11:06.501
No, mine...

11:06.502 --> 11:08.047
I'm okay.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.810
In fact, here's
how okay I am.

11:10.811 --> 11:11.829
I'm getting a tattoo.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.620
You're not getting
a tattoo, it's not you.

11:14.621 --> 11:18.731
Ted, you are heading
down a dark path.

11:18.877 --> 11:21.934
That dark path
is my driveway.

11:21.935 --> 11:23.168
But you need a plan

11:23.169 --> 11:25.076
and you need a wingman!

11:25.077 --> 11:28.887
This is so going
in my blog!

11:30.388 --> 11:33.898
Want to have sex?

11:34.140 --> 11:37.086
Okay.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.082
And underneath,

11:38.083 --> 11:40.319
it should
say, "I win. "

11:40.320 --> 11:42.538
And then it should have
flames coming out the bottom.

11:42.539 --> 11:44.042
Fire!

11:44.043 --> 11:46.211
We should start a fire.

11:46.212 --> 11:48.552
After this maybe.

11:48.553 --> 11:50.474
Oh, man, this is
going to be legend.

11:50.475 --> 11:51.695
Wait for it.

11:51.696 --> 11:53.196
And that's all I rember.

11:53.197 --> 11:57.487
The next morning,
I woke up alone back home.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:16.386 --> 12:17.843
Hey, buddy, how
was your night?

12:17.844 --> 12:20.292
You know,
it was great.

12:20.293 --> 12:22.921
I met this crazy girl,
I almost got a tattoo.

12:22.922 --> 12:24.294
Don't worry.

12:24.295 --> 12:26.128
I didn't, but it was...

12:26.129 --> 12:27.701
It was amazing.

12:27.702 --> 12:32.232
I think it's safe to say,
I am winning this breakup.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.813
Look.

12:34.814 --> 12:36.157
Oh, my God.

12:36.158 --> 12:37.140
What?

12:37.141 --> 12:37.997
Nothing.

12:37.998 --> 12:39.517
This J. Crew catalog.

12:39.518 --> 12:43.808
Who brings two Golden
Retrievers in a canoe?

12:44.812 --> 12:45.765
We got to
call Barney.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.703
Way ahead of you.

12:48.704 --> 12:50.268
Hey, guys, what's
the big emergency?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.773
Oh, and B the W:

12:51.774 --> 12:53.439
I am never speaking
to Ted again.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.804
Mm.
Really? Never?

12:54.805 --> 12:58.758
Not even if, say,
butterflies flew out of his ass?

12:58.759 --> 13:01.584
What?

13:01.585 --> 13:02.737
Ted?
Could you grab me

13:02.738 --> 13:06.488
the fondue pot?

13:06.917 --> 13:10.534
He has no idea.

13:10.535 --> 13:14.185
And up we go.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.495
Thank you.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.538
What?

13:19.539 --> 13:20.454
Ted?
Mm?

13:20.455 --> 13:23.769
I came here
this morning because...

13:23.770 --> 13:25.894
I want to apologize.

13:25.895 --> 13:27.207
Apology accepted, Barney.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.291
As you can see, I do
just fine on my own.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.616
I don't need a baby-sitter.

13:31.617 --> 13:33.005
See, all this time,

13:33.006 --> 13:34.725
I thought you need
a wingman to fly,

13:34.726 --> 13:36.917
but the truth is, you...

13:36.918 --> 13:38.336
you've got your
own wings now.

13:38.337 --> 13:39.668
Mm.

13:39.669 --> 13:43.070
Since you and Robin split,
you've been gestating.

13:43.071 --> 13:46.701
Growing in your coon.

13:46.805 --> 13:48.263
And last night...

13:48.264 --> 13:51.618
...you burst out of
that cocoon like a...

13:51.619 --> 13:54.611
like a majestic, uh...

13:54.612 --> 13:57.401
Gosh, what is it that
comes out of a cocoon?

13:57.402 --> 13:59.684
I was always
bad at science.

13:59.685 --> 14:02.012
He's going to say it!

14:02.013 --> 14:05.557
A butterfly?

14:05.558 --> 14:06.416
What?

14:06.417 --> 14:08.654
Nothing, buddy.

14:08.655 --> 14:12.495
Ow! Why did that hurt so...?

14:15.260 --> 14:18.431
Oh, my God!

14:18.432 --> 14:20.744
I have a tattoo!

14:20.745 --> 14:21.947
Oh, that's not a tattoo.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.250
That, dear boy,
is a tramp stamp.

14:25.251 --> 14:26.511
A tramp stamp.

14:26.512 --> 14:28.346
You know, a ho tag.

14:28.347 --> 14:29.962
Ass antlers.

14:29.963 --> 14:32.510
A Panama City license plate.

14:32.511 --> 14:34.449
And suddenly,
it all came back to me.

14:34.450 --> 14:35.934
...dary!

14:35.935 --> 14:39.420
Legendary!

14:39.421 --> 14:42.832
Man, I am so winning
this breakup.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.551
Mm. I just broke up

14:44.552 --> 14:46.028
with my boyfriend Steve.

14:46.029 --> 14:47.608
He was totally annoying.
He was, like,

14:47.609 --> 14:49.514
"I think you're the one,
I want to marry you. "

14:49.515 --> 14:52.005
What a wuss.

14:52.006 --> 14:52.605
Do you think

14:52.606 --> 14:53.970
exes can be friends?

14:53.971 --> 14:55.327
Yeah, sure.

14:55.328 --> 14:59.031
I mean, we're still friends,
right, Steve?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.413
Hey, your
name is Steve.

15:01.414 --> 15:02.006
And her

15:02.007 --> 15:04.332
ex-boyfriend's name is Steve.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.532
What are the odds of that...?

15:06.533 --> 15:09.983
Wait.

15:10.551 --> 15:12.157
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:12.158 --> 15:14.336
Give me this.

15:14.337 --> 15:16.309
Oh, yeah, that'll
get it out.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.678
Maybe you should
try club soda.

15:18.679 --> 15:19.835
Ow. Damn it, it really hurts.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.746
I need, like,

15:20.747 --> 15:22.102
some ointment
or something.

15:22.103 --> 15:23.389
What's this?

15:23.390 --> 15:26.990
Spanish massage oil.

15:27.278 --> 15:30.878
Spanish massage oil?

15:32.173 --> 15:36.073
What happened here last night?

15:36.247 --> 15:39.877
Last night got weird.

16:06.064 --> 16:08.656
Feel the emotions release.

16:08.657 --> 16:13.247
Think I just got over
being chunky in the ninth grade.

16:13.553 --> 16:16.422
You're beautiful.

16:16.423 --> 16:20.173
I am beautiful.

16:20.361 --> 16:23.991
Experience your food.

16:27.772 --> 16:31.472
Try the mango.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.991
Okay, that's enough
of the fruit.

16:35.992 --> 16:37.340
We're sorry, Ted.

16:37.341 --> 16:38.682
It'll never happen again.

16:38.683 --> 16:39.761
It meant
nothing to us.

16:39.762 --> 16:42.173
It just felt really,
really, really good.

16:42.174 --> 16:44.666
Oh! I can't even look
at you two right now.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.967
Ted...

16:49.500 --> 16:53.130
He got a tramp stamp.

17:01.261 --> 17:03.856
All right, first of all,
this isn't one of those,

17:03.857 --> 17:06.499
"I came all the way over here
because I want you back" things.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.714
There'll be no startling
confession of love,

17:08.714 --> 17:10.529
no sweet indie rock
song that swells up

17:10.530 --> 17:12.689
just as we're about to kiss,
none of that crap. Got it?

17:12.690 --> 17:13.874
Okay.
Good.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.671
Now, here's the thing.

17:15.672 --> 17:17.130
It sucks that you came
back from Argentina

17:17.131 --> 17:18.891
with someone as
awesome as Gael.

17:18.892 --> 17:20.920
And I know I have no
right to be upset at you.

17:20.921 --> 17:22.928
We're broken up, life
goes on, whatever.

17:22.929 --> 17:24.718
But you know what?
We-We never did this.

17:24.719 --> 17:26.297
We-We had this
polite breakup

17:26.298 --> 17:27.959
with no irrational
yelling, and...

17:27.960 --> 17:29.110
and that's just wrong!

17:29.111 --> 17:31.798
So, I'm going to yell
irrationally for a little while,

17:31.799 --> 17:33.125
and you're just going
to have to stand there

17:33.126 --> 17:34.533
and deal with it, okay?

17:34.534 --> 17:35.853
If you feel like
you need to do that, then...

17:35.854 --> 17:37.251
I think I do!

17:37.252 --> 17:38.641
I really think I do!

17:38.642 --> 17:42.212
So now I'm yelling!

17:42.618 --> 17:44.039
You shaved.
I did!

17:44.040 --> 17:45.645
I liked the beard.
I liked it, too, but it

17:45.646 --> 17:47.020
was getting kind of hot!

17:47.021 --> 17:47.989
Maybe in the winter,

17:47.990 --> 17:51.650
I'll grow it back out!

17:52.019 --> 17:54.135
Okay, I'm done.

17:54.136 --> 17:57.134
I know it was weird
showing up with Gael.

17:57.135 --> 18:00.227
I'm sorry.

18:00.228 --> 18:03.353
Look, us breaking up...
it was the right thing.

18:03.354 --> 18:05.519
But it took some time to
get over you, you know?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.526
I- I'm still
getting over you.

18:07.527 --> 18:08.537
But you? You were over it

18:08.538 --> 18:09.827
the minute they started
the in-flight movie.

18:09.828 --> 18:11.152
Over it?!

18:11.153 --> 18:12.536
My first three days
in Argentina,

18:12.537 --> 18:14.851
I cried my eyes out.

18:14.852 --> 18:15.725
I missed you

18:15.726 --> 18:17.201
so much.

18:17.202 --> 18:19.790
I wanted to go
and prove how adventurous I am,

18:19.791 --> 18:23.164
but the truth is...
it was really lonely.

18:23.165 --> 18:26.634
And that's why Gael happened.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.868
You weren't trying
to win the breakup?

18:28.869 --> 18:32.679
I was trying to survive it.

18:33.157 --> 18:34.373
Okay.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.125
No.

18:35.126 --> 18:37.373
See, look, that
all sounds good, and

18:37.374 --> 18:39.891
we'll still be friends
and move on, but...

18:39.892 --> 18:41.839
did he have to be so hot?

18:41.840 --> 18:43.044
The guy's
an Adonis.

18:43.045 --> 18:44.185
He's not an Adonis.

18:44.186 --> 18:46.593
He's the Cadillac
of rebound guys.

18:46.594 --> 18:48.621
Marshall has a
crush on him!

18:48.622 --> 18:49.418
The guy's perfect.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.236
He's not perfect.

18:50.237 --> 18:51.436
Oh, come on.

18:51.437 --> 18:55.419
He's hot, he wind surfs,
he massages things.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.299
Name one way I'm
better than that guy.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.611
You're bigger.

18:59.612 --> 19:00.750
Don't patronize
me. If anything,

19:00.751 --> 19:02.146
he may even be a
little bit taller.

19:02.147 --> 19:05.897
No. Ted... you're bigger.

19:06.455 --> 19:08.879
I win!

19:08.880 --> 19:10.059
Kids, I can't remember exactly

19:10.060 --> 19:13.129
what helped me get through
the whole Robin-Gael incident.

19:13.130 --> 19:16.302
I'm sure that it was something
profound and meaningful,

19:16.303 --> 19:19.198
and not at all macho and petty,

19:19.199 --> 19:22.069
but after that,
I was back on my feet.

19:22.070 --> 19:25.321
And what followed was a new era
in my life,a crazy time

19:25.322 --> 19:27.635
unlike anything
that came before.

19:27.636 --> 19:29.560
It's funny looking back
at those days,

19:29.561 --> 19:33.539
knowing now exactly
what I was heading towards.

19:33.540 --> 19:37.470
And what was heading
towards me.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.387
Go for Barney.

19:46.388 --> 19:48.607
Hey, man, it's Marshall.

19:48.608 --> 19:49.963
Check your e-mail.

19:49.964 --> 19:51.696
Sent you something.

19:51.697 --> 19:52.627
What is it?

19:52.628 --> 19:54.376
Just a new Web site.

19:54.377 --> 19:57.947
Slapcountdown. com.

19:59.973 --> 20:02.212
What does this mean?

20:02.213 --> 20:04.650
M- Marshall?

20:04.651 --> 20:08.101
Ma...

20:11.870 --> 20:14.409
No.

00:01.534 --> 00:03.000
And that story begins here.
