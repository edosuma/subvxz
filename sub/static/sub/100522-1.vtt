[SIZZLING]

01:18.612 --> 01:21.080
I did something really bad.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.585
Are you gonna tell me
or do you want me to guess?

01:26.587 --> 01:29.488
Did I ever mention
Marnie sleeps in the nude?

01:29.490 --> 01:30.622
Not to me.
Every night

01:30.624 --> 01:34.226
she climbs into bed naked,
just to go to sleep.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.360
Audra never sleeps naked.

01:35.362 --> 01:38.597
No. Audra's only naked
when she absolutely has to be.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.267
In the shower. Or if I take
her clothes off during sex.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.504
You wanna talk about that
or hear the bad thing I did?

01:45.506 --> 01:46.572
I wanna hear the bad thing.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.774
You went off on a tangent
about your wife.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.576
I piggybacked it.
Not a tangent.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.610
It's related.
All right.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.212
It shouldn't come
as any surprise

01:53.214 --> 01:57.816
that your sex life takes a major
hit once you start your family.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.817
Since my kids were born,

01:58.819 --> 02:01.520
we've had sex
maybe a dozen times.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.387
Your oldest is 11.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.456
I know how old
my fucking kids are.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.625
Maybe it's two dozen,
maybe three dozen.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.527
Even so, three dozen times
in 11 years.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.530
Roughly 3.3 times a year?
Stop doing the math.

02:11.532 --> 02:15.801
What's important is that Marnie
has zero interest in fucking me.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.302
Do you try to get her
in the mood?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.705
Dude, I'm so fed up
at this point.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.374
It'd be one thing
if she got fat after the kids.

02:22.376 --> 02:26.378
Maybe I wouldn't wanna bang her
so much, but she looks great.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.914

the elliptical machine.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.450

to ride my dick.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.918
Or the desire.
Yeah.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.021
That's why I'm trying
to enjoy the sex with Audra now

02:36.023 --> 02:37.956
while we're trying
to get pregnant.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.024
Yeah. Well, enjoy it

02:39.026 --> 02:41.894
because we used to have sex
seven nights a week.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.696
You guys strike me
as a once-a-week couple,

02:44.698 --> 02:45.864
so when Audra gets pregnant,

02:45.866 --> 02:49.668
next time you're getting laid
is when the kids go to college.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.336
I got pregnant
with my first boyfriend,

02:51.338 --> 02:54.673
junior year of high school.
So you know it's not you.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.074
Noel has shitty sperm.

02:56.076 --> 03:01.180
Not necessarily. Maybe Greg
had super-sperm. I don't know.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.348
You got pregnant
and you had an abortion.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.184
No, I didn't get an abortion.

03:05.186 --> 03:09.188
Before I got the nerve to
tell my parents, I miscarried.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.622
Okay, well, that's lucky.

03:10.624 --> 03:14.159
You didn't have a baby
junior year in high school?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.394
Dude, you dodged a bullet.

03:15.396 --> 03:19.164
Greg offered to marry me at 17.
My life would have been over.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.633
Oh, he would've been
a terrible husband, father.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.469
Noel, on the other hand,
is a wonderful husband

03:24.471 --> 03:25.370
who'd be an amazing dad.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.674
If he didn't have shitty sperm.
We don't know that.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.343
How would he feel if he knew
you'd been pregnant?

03:31.345 --> 03:33.278
Not great. That was information

03:33.280 --> 03:36.181
that was supposed to stay
locked in the vault.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.750
Couples need secrets.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.487
Tell me the bad thing
you did, huh?

03:42.990 --> 03:47.459
Last night, I make a move,
she shuts me down, per usual.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.860
Rolls over, goes to sleep.

03:48.862 --> 03:53.799
Now, I'm laying there
with an angry, purple hard-on,

03:53.801 --> 03:55.033
and I just start jerking,

03:55.035 --> 03:57.536
right there in the bed,
right next to her.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.472
Wow.
I'm frustrated.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.040
I'm resentful.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.143

about her under my breath.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.813
She doesn't wake up?
No, very heavy sleeper.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.481
So around when
I'm about to blow,

04:09.483 --> 04:13.752
I get up on my knees
and I unload all over her tits.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.488
Oh, God.
I just hovered there, right?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.923
Just looking at her.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.958
With a big smile on my face.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.027
Then I got up,
went to the bathroom,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.562
I got a damp washcloth,

04:23.564 --> 04:27.633
gave her a little kiss on
the forehead, cleaned her up.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.668
And she has no idea it happened.

I'm not sure.
I didn't think

45:37.836 --> 45:40.470

with a woman, so...

45:40.472 --> 45:42.538

two plus one equals three.

Or one plus one plus one
equals three.

Yeah. It is the math
that gets you to three.

I mean, potentially,

I didn't coax Audra
into bed when we were 19.

46:40.431 --> 46:44.667
Right.
No, I-- I kissed her, and...

46:44.669 --> 46:46.836
she hesitated because
she's cautious by nature,

46:46.838 --> 46:51.774
but ultimately she wanted it as
much as I did, so it happened.

46:51.776 --> 46:55.077
So if you're into this,

out the window the first second.

to have a threesome with us?

a certain logic in that, yeah.

Okay.

49:41.245 --> 49:44.447
On one hand, I would say,
let's not get dramatic.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.248
And on the other hand,
I would say,

49:46.250 --> 49:48.651
that's the exact
same reaction I had

49:48.653 --> 49:50.319
when you told me
you slept with her.

49:50.321 --> 49:53.622
It was like I didn't
know you for a second.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.124

49:55.126 --> 49:57.626
it wasn't
that outrageous a thing.

to please than you.

one part of sex.
