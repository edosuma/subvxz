00:32.865 --> 00:33.342
Whoa!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.998
Hello, boils and ghouls.

00:36.171 --> 00:37.787
I am the crypt-keeper,

00:38.013 --> 00:41.985
or should I say master of scare-i-monies?

00:45.085 --> 00:46.163
Priceless, sir.

00:46.191 --> 00:48.368
You made the word "ceremonies" frightening.

00:48.432 --> 00:49.794
I know what I did.

00:50.515 --> 00:52.034
Hey, can we get going here?

00:52.597 --> 00:55.130
Listening to you two is more torture than the torture.

00:59.933 --> 01:01.974
Actually, no, this is worse.

01:02.267 --> 01:05.034
Although the right nipple spike seems a little dull.

01:05.321 --> 01:06.151
ha, ha

01:06.219 --> 01:07.882
Oh, yeah.

01:07.957 --> 01:09.422
Oh, that's barbaric.

01:12.316 --> 01:13.500
Whoa, look at that!

01:13.515 --> 01:14.691
My blood's a genius.

01:14.736 --> 01:16.120
Fancy Roman numerals

01:16.125 --> 01:16.893
and everything.

01:25.146 --> 01:26.422
married to the blob

01:32.587 --> 01:33.182
Look!

01:33.215 --> 01:35.140
A shooting star!

01:35.215 --> 01:36.433
Hey, that's great.

01:36.478 --> 01:37.462
Let's look at it after.

01:40.345 --> 01:41.661
Whoa!

01:43.137 --> 01:43.951
That almost tore

01:43.956 --> 01:44.763
my head off.

01:44.777 --> 01:46.563
Oh, you always find an excuse

01:46.565 --> 01:47.593
not to make out.

01:52.408 --> 01:53.920
Whoo! A space marshmallow.

01:54.098 --> 01:54.720
hï¿½

01:54.807 --> 01:56.460
Where do you think you're going?

01:59.795 --> 02:01.070
Dad, no!

02:01.075 --> 02:02.362
It could teach us the secret

02:02.378 --> 02:04.252
of interstellar travel.

02:04.335 --> 02:05.472
If he's so smart, how come

02:05.475 --> 02:06.721
he can't stay out of my mouth?

02:14.097 --> 02:14.661
How could you

02:14.666 --> 02:15.840
eat that goo?

02:15.918 --> 02:16.382
You don't know

02:16.386 --> 02:18.223
what galaxy it's from.

02:18.367 --> 02:20.642
Marge, I ate it. It's over.

02:20.948 --> 02:22.573
Whoa. Oh, no, you don't.

02:31.838 --> 02:33.041
If I can keep down Arby's,

02:33.046 --> 02:34.170
I can keep down you.

02:44.168 --> 02:47.133
Must eat, then poop,

02:47.138 --> 02:49.012
then eat some more,

02:49.015 --> 02:51.480
then eat while pooping.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.381
Still hungry.

02:59.397 --> 03:00.323
Dad?

03:01.356 --> 03:03.751
Son, let me have a lick at you.

03:07.758 --> 03:08.861
Homer!

03:09.527 --> 03:10.173
You won't eat

03:10.176 --> 03:11.360
my stuffed peppers,

03:11.397 --> 03:12.970
but you'll eat our son?

03:12.977 --> 03:14.343
Nag, nag, nag.

03:19.177 --> 03:20.321
Is that the cat?

03:20.377 --> 03:22.402
Uh, no, just gas.

03:22.548 --> 03:24.712
Food. Ooh. Food.

03:28.677 --> 03:29.241
Ooh!

03:30.036 --> 03:30.663
Ooh!

03:32.716 --> 03:34.281
Ooh, teenagers.

03:37.168 --> 03:38.172
No, today's teens

03:38.177 --> 03:38.981
have enough problems

03:39.008 --> 03:40.082
without me eating them.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.922
Barbeque sauce fight!

03:43.978 --> 03:45.581
Oh, I gotcha!

03:48.076 --> 03:49.360
The flames are sealing

03:49.365 --> 03:50.571
in my juices.

03:50.637 --> 03:52.563
I'll savor you.

03:55.497 --> 03:56.620
Mmm.

03:56.717 --> 03:58.471
Extra-virgin.

04:02.545 --> 04:04.420
Tell my friends I died

04:04.437 --> 04:06.103
kissing a girl!

04:06.126 --> 04:06.511
No.

04:09.777 --> 04:13.662
Ooh.  Beer-battered Germans.

04:21.646 --> 04:23.492
What did we Germans ever do

04:23.528 --> 04:24.651
to deserve this?

04:25.158 --> 04:27.173
Oh, right.

04:27.525 --> 04:30.261
Must eat more fat people.

04:30.426 --> 04:32.050
Thank God I'm in America.

04:32.118 --> 04:34.942
I like big guts and I cannot lie

04:34.958 --> 04:36.720
Double chins with the chafing thighs

04:36.738 --> 04:38.660
When a dude walks in with the hanging jowls

04:38.668 --> 04:41.372
My stomach starts to growl--I'm gettin' hungry

04:41.376 --> 04:43.750
So I masticate,chomping on the overweight

04:43.758 --> 04:46.050
I eat fat people for days

04:46.055 --> 04:47.962
Like potato chips by Lay's

04:47.966 --> 04:49.862
Try to eat just one,but it can't be done

04:49.868 --> 04:51.252
I've got to eat a ton

04:51.255 --> 04:52.582
Baby likes fat

04:54.746 --> 04:56.670
Baby likes fat.

04:57.578 --> 05:00.462
I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.

05:06.625 --> 05:09.800
It's blob rule on the streets of Springfield.

05:09.838 --> 05:11.881
And to make matters worse,we're also being attacked

05:11.916 --> 05:13.931
by a 50-foot Lenny.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.242
Everyone's paying attention to Homer.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.601
I still like you.

05:17.825 --> 05:19.252
Thanks, Invisible Carl.

05:21.686 --> 05:23.392
Mmm. Mmm.

05:23.596 --> 05:24.610
Mmm.

05:25.077 --> 05:26.452
Hi-de-ho, Bloborino.

05:27.017 --> 05:28.363
Eh. Mm.

05:28.695 --> 05:29.430
Homer?

05:29.445 --> 05:30.061
Hmm?

05:30.456 --> 05:31.042
I need to

05:31.047 --> 05:31.962
talk to you.

05:32.406 --> 05:33.990
Dr. Phil McGraw!

05:34.135 --> 05:37.410
You've got a weight problem,and you know it.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.322
You're right.

05:38.687 --> 05:41.152
Starting tomorrow,no bread before dinner.

05:41.197 --> 05:44.832
Homer, don't sell me an outhouse and tell me it's the Taj Mahal.

05:44.907 --> 05:46.620
Yeah, Homer,stop doing that.

05:46.767 --> 05:49.640
It's time to open up a can of honesty.

05:49.727 --> 05:52.293
You're thinking about eating me right now,

05:52.298 --> 05:53.270
aren't you?

05:53.995 --> 05:54.780
aren't you?

05:55.768 --> 05:58.743
That's ridiculous,talking fudge.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.513
Homer, your family's here.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.763
And you got to help me help them

06:02.778 --> 06:04.660
help you help me help you.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.590
Marge, I missed you.

06:06.738 --> 06:09.553
All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.402
I have to be honest with you:

06:13.406 --> 06:16.323
I can't lovea 4,000-ton cannibal.

06:16.387 --> 06:18.760
What  happened to "for betteror for worse?!"

06:18.878 --> 06:20.693
Dad, you're eating Dr. Phil.

06:21.807 --> 06:22.803
It's amazing.

06:23.138 --> 06:25.330
He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.

06:27.115 --> 06:29.450
Food does not equal love!

06:31.415 --> 06:34.481
Marge, to keep you in my life,I'd do anything.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.641
There must be some way to turn myblem

06:36.648 --> 06:38.673
into a positive for the community.

06:39.017 --> 06:41.251
H mm...Hmm...

06:41.488 --> 06:42.812
In you go, boys.

06:42.817 --> 06:46.313
We've got everything--warm beds, square meals,

06:46.465 --> 06:48.043
homeless women.

06:49.986 --> 06:52.431
I got a bad feeling about this, Blue.

06:56.957 --> 06:58.240
Get in there.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.902
Nice to be indoors, isn't it?

07:08.766 --> 07:11.563
You gotta know when to golem

07:12.278 --> 07:13.703
Finally, I'd like to announce

07:13.717 --> 07:15.860
that starting Monday,this show will be

07:15.873 --> 07:18.204
broadcast in HDTV.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.464
Here's how I'll look.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.551
Heh?

07:22.239 --> 07:25.062
That's right: look at your hero!

07:27.346 --> 07:28.513
Good night, everybody.

07:28.596 --> 07:30.043
Aren't you coming, Bart?

07:30.167 --> 07:32.150
Nah, I'm gonna go backstage and complain.

07:32.156 --> 07:35.442
This Krusty Brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face.

07:35.866 --> 07:36.572
Oh!

07:36.576 --> 07:39.162
You already showed me before!

07:40.688 --> 07:43.152
Whoa, Krusty's prop room.

07:47.117 --> 07:48.641
Cool! It's that clown car

07:48.647 --> 07:50.283
all those midgets drowned in.

07:51.518 --> 07:53.062
Wha..?

07:56.396 --> 07:58.280
Hey, kid.This ain't a museum.

07:58.426 --> 07:59.980
That's a museum.

08:00.145 --> 08:01.930
For kids, $49 bucks.

08:02.188 --> 08:04.633
Krusty, what's that monster?

08:04.925 --> 08:07.733
It's the Golem of Prague.

08:09.147 --> 08:11.663
Legendary defender of the Jewish people,

08:11.757 --> 08:14.531
like Alan Dershowitz, but with a conscience.

08:15.098 --> 08:17.123
I kid Alan. We're friends.

08:17.178 --> 08:19.751
Anyway,back in the 1600s...

08:20.655 --> 08:23.193
a rabbi created this magic creature out

08:23.198 --> 08:24.810
of humble clay.

08:28.558 --> 08:30.263
The golem would perform any task

08:30.266 --> 08:31.902
that was written on a scroll

08:31.948 --> 08:33.702
and placed in its mouth.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.303
Now he works for me.

08:50.058 --> 08:52.463
Sohe wife says,"I don't have to pay for it.

08:52.557 --> 08:54.081
I put it on my charge plate."

08:54.167 --> 08:55.443
You suck, clown!

08:55.506 --> 08:57.091
You made my lady cry!

09:05.086 --> 09:08.500
"Come to my house at midnight."

09:12.988 --> 09:14.500
Now if you'll excuse me,

09:14.508 --> 09:17.913
I have to rehearse my "Desperate Houseflies" sketch.

09:18.348 --> 09:19.510
Buzz, buzz.

09:19.645 --> 09:23.123
Ooh, here comesthat sexy young garbageman.

09:25.987 --> 09:27.740
I'm gonna needa shoebox full of blow

09:27.745 --> 09:28.932
to get through this dreck.

09:44.068 --> 09:45.013
Bart,

09:45.217 --> 09:47.291
there's something I have to tell you

09:47.296 --> 09:48.592
father to son.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.691
I passed out on your turtle and killed it.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.151
Someday you'll thank me.

09:54.057 --> 09:55.200
Hey, Milhouse.

09:57.435 --> 09:58.630
It worked!

09:58.758 --> 10:00.050
Now, there's something I've wanted

10:00.056 --> 10:01.413
to do for a long time.

10:06.636 --> 10:07.910
Can't you read my writing?

10:07.916 --> 10:09.981
I didn't say kick Homer's "walls".

10:10.375 --> 10:11.282
What's goin' on?

10:11.687 --> 10:13.161
Ow!That's better.

10:18.946 --> 10:19.851
Yo, Simpson.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.062
Give us your lunch money.

10:21.105 --> 10:23.261
Mmm... I don't think so.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.851
In fact, why don't you give me

10:25.865 --> 10:27.122
your lunch money?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.233
Well, who's gonna make us? That golem?

10:29.237 --> 10:30.783
No, my go-

10:31.235 --> 10:32.172
Yes, him.

10:42.406 --> 10:44.813
Finally, someone who does whatever I say.

10:44.817 --> 10:45.482
Hey, Bart,

10:45.488 --> 10:47.263
I shaved my head like you told me.

10:47.545 --> 10:48.322
Get lost.

10:48.336 --> 10:49.413
Yes, Master

10:53.417 --> 10:54.211
Bart.

10:54.268 --> 10:57.260
Did your mystical
Jewish monsterbeat up those bullies?

10:57.317 --> 10:59.010
Oh, it's always the Jews' fault.

10:59.417 --> 11:03.210
Well I think your golem doesn't like
hurting people and I'll prove it.

11:04.917 --> 11:05.913
"Speak."

11:14.106 --> 11:15.260
Finally, I can talk!

11:15.467 --> 11:16.660
This is the voice I've got?

11:16.868 --> 11:19.661
Sounds like I should be selling
egg creams in Brighton Beach.

11:21.315 --> 11:23.310
That's what we call Jewish humor.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.911
You don't have to understand
it'cause the words sound funny.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.412
Meshuggeneh. Hilarious.

11:29.017 --> 11:30.663
Hello? Huh?

11:30.916 --> 11:32.242
It's funny, believe me.

11:33.418 --> 11:35.062
Do you feel bad
about what you did?

11:35.116 --> 11:36.363
Of course I feel bad.

11:36.368 --> 11:39.263
My stomach feels like it's hosting
the Chabad telethon

11:39.266 --> 11:41.863
and Norm Crosby's going long.

11:46.168 --> 11:48.960
"Kill the czar"?
Now that's an old one.

11:51.115 --> 11:52.473
Hey, boy, where's your mud buddy?

11:52.477 --> 11:55.060
I have a little job for him.

11:59.115 --> 12:01.811
Oh, he was driving me crazy,
so I sent him on an errand.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.362
Skinner! Just let him kill you already.

12:08.617 --> 12:10.580
That's the man I wastelling you about.

12:15.327 --> 12:16.323
Skinner!

12:16.525 --> 12:18.591
I wish we'd been closer.

12:18.816 --> 12:20.161
Get him out of here, Willie.

12:20.268 --> 12:22.910
You'll make better mulch
than you did a man.

12:23.015 --> 12:25.663
I may be bifurcated,
but I still have feelings.

12:26.867 --> 12:30.392
I feel so guilty. I've mangled
and maimed 37 people

12:30.397 --> 12:33.211
and I told a telemarketer
I was busy when I wasn't.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.510
I'm not a good man.

12:34.715 --> 12:36.711
He sure is neurotic for a monster.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.413
The cure to any man's problems
is a good relationship.

12:41.765 --> 12:44.813
Yeah, get him a woman.
That'll end his misery.

12:49.416 --> 12:52.113
Ow, ow!
This hurts so much.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.513
Just write a scroll asking him to stop.

12:54.515 --> 12:55.510
Writing's for nerds.

12:58.316 --> 12:59.461
You got a surprise for me?

12:59.666 --> 13:03.061
The surprise would be if I found
some good live theater in this town.

13:03.168 --> 13:07.413
Then people could have some drinks,
watch Fiddler. Very nice.

13:07.517 --> 13:08.910
Will you shut up.

13:20.316 --> 13:22.010
Is she for me?

13:22.117 --> 13:23.611
Hanukkah came early this year,

13:24.015 --> 13:25.362
which it sometimes does.

13:33.797 --> 13:36.810
Hello, everybody.

13:39.415 --> 13:41.013
Ugh! What's with this outfit?

13:41.015 --> 13:44.010
It looks like a lion ate
a parrot and then threw up.

13:46.715 --> 13:49.263
- Well, back to the drawing board.
- No!

13:49.268 --> 13:51.451
What are you? Nuts?
She was made for me.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.612
I now pronounce you monster
and whatever you are.

13:55.915 --> 13:56.911
Shayna punim.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.513
Not so fast.

14:00.516 --> 14:03.211
You're wanted for the
murder of Seymour Skinner.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.061
Oh, come on, Chief.

14:05.317 --> 14:08.610
We've got a lat kebar downstairs.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.412
Latkes? What the hell are those?

14:10.468 --> 14:12.760
- They're pan-fried...
- Case dismissed.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.760
Wonderful!

14:17.415 --> 14:19.760
Gloomy Sunday

14:19.766 --> 14:23.891
With shadows I spend it all

14:24.295 --> 14:31.380
My heart and I have decided
to end it all...

14:32.116 --> 14:32.783
I don't get it.

14:32.786 --> 14:35.112
What's so "Great" about this Depression?

14:35.116 --> 14:37.563
Well, I like how everything's sepia-toned.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.413
Makes  me feel all nostalgic.

14:39.465 --> 14:43.440
I never thought it would come to this
when I fought in the first World War.

14:43.546 --> 14:45.750
First World War?
Why you keep callin' it that?

14:45.855 --> 14:47.832
Oh, you'll see.

14:53.048 --> 14:55.841
We interrupt this dance music
from the Meridian Room

14:55.847 --> 14:58.063
in Capital City's
fabulous Hotel Hitler

14:58.065 --> 14:59.642
to bring you a special bulletin.

14:59.646 --> 15:01.413
Hey, I'm not done dancing.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.710
This bulletin better swing.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.431
Reports are coming in
of giant metal cylin landing

15:06.435 --> 15:08.263
on the outskirts
of major American cities.

15:09.318 --> 15:10.313
Cylinders?

15:10.617 --> 15:12.510
Astronomers say
the ominous capsules

15:12.515 --> 15:14.631
originated from Earth's
closest neighbor.

15:15.075 --> 15:17.411
- Flanders?
- Mars.

15:18.865 --> 15:20.263
So,  it's a war of the worlds.

15:22.015 --> 15:23.763
Good thing we got the sun on our side.

15:26.568 --> 15:28.612
Go ahead and hide, you coward.

15:29.915 --> 15:31.813
I'm in the small town
of Grover's Mill.

15:31.817 --> 15:34.213
where a crowd has gathered
around one of the strange

15:34.217 --> 15:35.313
Martian cylinders.

15:35.615 --> 15:37.762
It's opening.
A tentacle is emerging.

15:39.865 --> 15:40.912
Settle down, children.

15:40.915 --> 15:43.232
Have a cigarette to calm your nerves.

15:45.218 --> 15:46.213
Oh, my stars.

15:46.215 --> 15:48.310
It's firing a beam
of pure energy.

15:48.916 --> 15:50.613
It's burning people alive.

15:53.617 --> 15:54.661
Okay, boys, we're under attack.

15:54.666 --> 15:57.240
Let's drive 'em out of town
the way we did with the Irish.

15:57.287 --> 15:58.840
Hey, I'm Irish.

16:00.518 --> 16:01.513
Oh, wait, I'm Polish.

16:04.117 --> 16:05.673
The devastation is incredible.

16:05.677 --> 16:08.310
They're grinding up the
bodies of human beings.

16:09.617 --> 16:11.582
Now they're riding horses in the rain.

16:12.917 --> 16:16.261
Now they're playing the xylophone
while bowling near an airport

16:21.295 --> 16:22.812
Now, before we all die,

16:22.915 --> 16:26.262
one last selection from the Nathan Newley Orchestra.

16:26.508 --> 16:31.432
I'm  young and healthy
And you've got charms...

16:32.596 --> 16:35.493
Gee, Mr. Welles,
this sure is a swell show

16:35.496 --> 16:36.573
you're puttin' on for the folks.

16:36.805 --> 16:39.712
Well, I just hope our saucy lile radio prank

16:39.717 --> 16:42.862
will give these "folks," as
you call them, a giggle, a gasp,

16:42.866 --> 16:45.910
and provide a good lead-in
for Misters Amos and Andy.

16:50.068 --> 16:51.362
Burn everything.

16:51.568 --> 16:54.513
You know, Homer,
we haven't actually seen these aliens.

16:54.518 --> 16:56.331
That's alien talk.

16:57.206 --> 17:00.011
"Big Band Stu," says 23 Skidoo.

17:01.566 --> 17:03.060
We have nothing to fear

17:03.465 --> 17:07.160
but the aliens and their vastly
superior killing technology.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.613
Boys, we have to assume our guns are useless.

17:09.615 --> 17:10.560
Throw 'em in the lake.

17:12.516 --> 17:13.761
Good. Now, the police car.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.530
Wait, did you get my sweater
out of the front seat?

17:20.537 --> 17:21.531
Uh, yeah.

17:21.536 --> 17:24.310
- Well, where is it?
- I'll go get it.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.772
Wait, I have an idea.

17:30.966 --> 17:35.883
The Martians are only killing humans,
so we should pretend to be animals.

17:36.165 --> 17:37.182
Ingenious.

17:37.688 --> 17:41.712
Everyone, remove your
clothes and wallow in filth.

18:02.065 --> 18:03.690
What is everyone doing?

18:03.695 --> 18:05.510
We're out smarting the Martians.

18:07.066 --> 18:07.861
Martians?

18:07.865 --> 18:10.463
You do know that radio
broadcast was a hoax?

18:11.276 --> 18:15.062
Yeah, it was an Orson Welles radio play
of War of the Worlds.

18:15.468 --> 18:16.462
See.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.911
I'm proud of what I achieved
during my rioting.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.791
It was either kill himor kill no one.

18:29.865 --> 18:31.543
Foolish Earthlings.

18:31.547 --> 18:34.031
Now is the perfect time to strike.

18:34.138 --> 18:35.903
They'll thin kit's another hoax.

18:47.265 --> 18:50.212
Dad, a flying saucer
blew up that statue.

18:50.315 --> 18:52.612
Lisa, that was just a radio show.

18:52.815 --> 18:53.810
Uh, Paw.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.861
Please, you must believe me,
this is no hoax.

19:00.865 --> 19:02.312
This is a real invasion.

19:02.316 --> 19:05.111
Oh, yeah? Why don't I just
punch you in the nose, Bud?

19:06.415 --> 19:07.413
"Nosebud."

19:08.518 --> 19:10.730
Chief, you've got
to alert the military.

19:10.738 --> 19:11.933
Fine, fine,
I'll do it right now.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.092
- US Army. What's the threat?
- Uh, we've been invaded...

19:17.195 --> 19:19.280
by a pompous, radio ham.

19:20.068 --> 19:22.401
How's it feel when the
hoax is on the other foot?

19:22.407 --> 19:24.763
I must admit it's unpleasant.

19:27.358 --> 19:29.561
You fool.
You've doomed us all.

19:29.665 --> 19:31.773
Eh, tell it to the Great
Gildersleeve.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.211
Well, they didn'teat the skin.

19:39.215 --> 19:40.861
That's...that's healthy.

19:51.338 --> 19:52.830
Colonel Kang, your report.

19:52.838 --> 19:54.411
Uh, well...

19:54.415 --> 19:56.913
The Earthlings continue
to resent our presence.

19:58.316 --> 20:00.860
You said we'd be greeted as liberators.

20:01.365 --> 20:02.361
Don't worry.

20:02.365 --> 20:05.191
We still have the people's
hearts and minds.

20:05.598 --> 20:06.591
I don't know.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.113
I'm starting to think
"Operation: Enduring Occupation"

20:10.116 --> 20:13.171
- was a bad idea.
- We had to invade.

20:13.177 --> 20:16.710
They were working on weapons of mass disintegration.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.312
Sure they were.

20:24.275 --> 20:33.461
I don't want to set the world on fire

20:33.867 --> 20:40.193
I just want to start a flame in your heart.
