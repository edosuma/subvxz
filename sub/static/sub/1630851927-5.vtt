Previously on "Yellowstone"...

00:10.241 --> 00:11.413
- Who's this?

00:11.482 --> 00:13.000
- That's the man
hired to kill us.

00:13.068 --> 00:14.586
- Hired by who?

00:14.655 --> 00:16.655
- You need to ask your brother
for his prison records.

00:16.724 --> 00:20.586
If he resists in any way,
then we have our answer.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.931
- Oh, my God.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.586
- Schwartz & Meyer runs
half the land

00:24.655 --> 00:27.034
on the north side
of the Yellowstone.

You're a corporate raider.

00:28.517 --> 00:30.551
Come and raid
for Market Equities.

00:30.620 --> 00:34.137
- You have controlling interest
of Schwartz & Meyer now.

00:34.206 --> 00:36.000
- You want a piece
of Schwartz & Meyer.

00:36.068 --> 00:37.172
- I want your piece.

00:37.241 --> 00:38.551
You give me that, I'm yours.

00:39.724 --> 00:41.655
- Get up and dance, old man.
[grunts]

00:41.724 --> 00:42.965
- Stop it!

00:43.034 --> 00:44.517
- What's the rule
about fighting, Lloyd?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.551
- God damn you for making me
do this.

00:49.068 --> 00:50.862
- He's never gonna
get better staying here.

00:50.931 --> 00:52.724
- I was thinking we can go up
and stay at your father's place

00:52.793 --> 00:55.620
for a while until we can find
another place close to here.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.620

to do to find happiness?

- Could've done without the
anatomy lesson, but that's okay.

02:44.344 --> 02:46.034
I'll work that shit
out in therapy.

02:47.655 --> 02:49.896
- Well, Beth...

02:49.896 --> 02:52.689
That's a risk you take when
you sneak into a man's bedroom

02:52.689 --> 02:55.000
in the middle of the night.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.103
- Don't I know it.

02:57.689 --> 02:59.862
- And a drink.
Oof!

03:01.310 --> 03:05.793
This news must be
real good or real bad.

03:06.793 --> 03:08.068
- In my 37 years,

03:08.068 --> 03:10.448
I've only spent the night
here alone once.

03:12.137 --> 03:13.724
You know, houses,
they don't make noises

03:13.724 --> 03:16.137
when they're full of people
but when they're empty...

03:16.137 --> 03:20.448
Man, they moan and they creak
and they shift in place.

03:20.448 --> 03:22.896
I thought the house was going
to tear itself out

03:22.896 --> 03:24.379
from the foundation
and walk away.

03:25.793 --> 03:29.965
So, I figured that I would
just spend the night

03:29.965 --> 03:32.068
and make sure it doesn't walk
away with you.

03:33.206 --> 03:34.862
- I don't uh...

03:34.862 --> 03:38.172
I don't mind an empty house.
- Mm.

03:38.172 --> 03:39.965
Liar.

03:39.965 --> 03:40.965
- I'll, uh...

03:43.689 --> 03:45.620
I'll get your room ready.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.206
- Oh, my room's
ready enough, Dad.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.103
- You ready to turn in?

03:50.103 --> 03:51.137
- You kidding?

03:52.620 --> 03:54.241
I'm five away from sleep.

03:54.241 --> 03:55.758
Look, I can go downstairs.

03:55.758 --> 03:58.034
- No, no, honey.
No, you're...

- "The Solace of Open Spaces."

04:30.103 --> 04:33.413
"To be tough is to be fragile.

04:33.413 --> 04:36.586
To be tender is
to be truly fierce."

04:36.586 --> 04:38.931
- "True solace is finding none.

04:38.931 --> 04:41.724
Which is to say,
it's everywhere."

04:42.793 --> 04:46.793
- Yeah.
Not sure I believe that.

04:46.793 --> 04:50.000
- It's true, Beth.
Can't be found.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.551
Lord knows I've looked.

04:52.724 --> 04:56.586
No... Solace...
must be discovered.

04:58.551 --> 04:59.896
- Discovered how?

05:03.275 --> 05:06.931
I need an example, 'cause, um...

05:06.931 --> 05:08.448
Well, I've looked
everywhere, too.

05:14.103 --> 05:15.275
- [sighs]

05:17.000 --> 05:21.068
I spent all evening on
the porch staring at mountains,

05:21.068 --> 05:23.620
listening to birds...

05:23.620 --> 05:26.241
Heart still empty.

05:26.241 --> 05:28.172
I take a shower
to wash it away like dirt

05:28.172 --> 05:31.068
but you can't wash lonely off.

05:31.068 --> 05:33.551
So, I surrender to it.

05:35.482 --> 05:38.896
Best I can do
is sleep through the lonely,

05:38.896 --> 05:40.068
if I can sleep at all.

05:42.379 --> 05:48.103
Then I walk in here
and I discover you.

05:49.931 --> 05:51.068
Now my heart's full.

05:53.931 --> 05:55.793
I sure hope you
outlive me, Beth.

05:55.793 --> 05:59.896
I'm not sure I could tolerate
the world without you in it.

Well, I guess tomorrow's
my lucky day, then.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.965
Good night, baby girl.

06:29.103 --> 06:30.103

07:55.517 --> 07:56.689
- We both do.

07:58.586 --> 08:01.793
- Find us a house to rent.

08:01.793 --> 08:04.413
We're done living with
fathers for a little while.

08:06.551 --> 08:08.000
- [sighs]

08:08.000 --> 08:10.620
I feel better already.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.793
In my soul.

08:13.482 --> 08:14.827
- That's all that matters.

- Is he okay?

09:01.206 --> 09:03.034
- Well...

09:03.034 --> 09:05.275
He's a boy who was forced
to do what men do.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.724
These days, most men
won't even do it.

09:08.724 --> 09:14.103
because society has taught
them that they are sheep.

09:14.103 --> 09:17.206
And when wolves come
you must not fight them.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.137
You must call a shepherd.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.206
So, he feels guilt
for doing something

09:24.206 --> 09:26.172
he should be praised for.

09:27.862 --> 09:31.310
A few more sweats, then Mo
will take him up on the hill.

09:33.068 --> 09:34.689
Then when he comes down,

09:34.689 --> 09:36.241
he won't think of
himself as a killer.

09:37.793 --> 09:39.310
He'll think of
himself as a warrior.

09:41.137 --> 09:42.448
Like you.

09:45.137 --> 09:46.379
- I'm hardly a warrior.

09:48.275 --> 09:49.586
- How much guilt do you feel?

09:51.241 --> 09:53.862
- My only regret is that
I didn't kill him myself.

09:53.862 --> 09:57.586
- [chuckles]

09:57.586 --> 09:58.620
- That's a warrior's regret.

10:00.137 --> 10:01.965
[music]

10:21.241 --> 10:23.206
- Give that horse
to Mia today, Lloyd.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.344
Pull that new bay
from the mare corral.

10:25.344 --> 10:27.034
She needs ridin'.

10:27.034 --> 10:28.965

I ain't riding a fucking mare.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.310
- Then you'll walk.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.620
And take that boy and show him
how to saddle a horse.

10:40.758 --> 10:41.896

- Horn, pommel,

10:58.620 --> 11:01.827
skirt, seat, rigging.

11:03.275 --> 11:06.517
- Cinch, latigo,

11:06.517 --> 11:07.724
stirrup...

11:09.655 --> 11:11.344
D rings.

11:11.344 --> 11:13.068
Back billet.

D rings, back billet.

11:19.068 --> 11:20.517

11:33.724 --> 11:34.862
Okay, go.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.793
Okay, reach under her
and grab that cinch.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.310
- Cinch.

11:44.310 --> 11:48.413
- Okay, latigo goes
through your D-ring.

11:48.413 --> 11:51.896
Back up and through.

11:51.896 --> 11:54.275
Back through that D-ring again.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.758
Pull it up snug.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.827
Good, now the same thing
on the back cinch.

12:05.482 --> 12:06.862

12:06.862 --> 12:09.206
Now this is your latigo keeper.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.586
It's got the name of
the saddlemaker right on it.

Can you read?

12:12.689 --> 12:13.724
- Yeah.

12:13.724 --> 12:16.724
- Okay. I ride a Sterling.

12:16.724 --> 12:20.275
Mister Dutton, he rides
a Dale Harwood or a Don Rich.

12:20.275 --> 12:23.034
And Rip, he rides
an Andy Maschke.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.896
- What do the others ride?

12:24.896 --> 12:28.965
- Don't matter.
They saddle their own horses.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.965
- Lloyd, when you're
done with that,

12:30.965 --> 12:33.103
start moving them panels
into the arena.

state prison warden

12:57.655 --> 12:59.241
on the line for me, please?

12:59.241 --> 13:01.379
- Of course.
[beep]

13:06.172 --> 13:08.172
Sir, Warden Jeffries
is on line one.

13:12.241 --> 13:13.689
- How are you, sir?

13:16.482 --> 13:18.344
Does he have
a public defender or counsel?

Attorney General Dutton
for Richard Scott.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.724
Mr. Scott, I need to interview
your client Terrell Riggins

13:42.724 --> 13:43.931
in regards to his involvement

13:43.931 --> 13:46.137
in the John Dutton
attempted murder.

13:47.862 --> 13:49.206
That won't be necessary.

13:51.275 --> 13:52.965
Because I'm offering
him immunity.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.586
- Shit!

14:05.586 --> 14:07.379
What the fuck is that?

14:07.379 --> 14:08.896
- That's a centipede.

14:08.896 --> 14:10.103
It get you?

14:12.241 --> 14:14.103
- Uh, yeah.
It got me.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.620
- Most people in Texas
don't sleep on the ground.

14:19.172 --> 14:20.724
I brought you some breakfast.

14:23.172 --> 14:26.586
- [grunts]

14:33.448 --> 14:34.482
You got a fork?

14:36.517 --> 14:38.034
- Make a sandwich out of it.

14:41.137 --> 14:43.103
Who are you?

14:43.103 --> 14:45.724
- I'm Jimmy.
I'm the new cowboy.

14:45.724 --> 14:48.068
- [chuckles]

14:48.068 --> 14:50.689
You're not a cowboy.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.758
- What makes you say that?

14:52.758 --> 14:55.896
- I can see it in your eyes.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.448
You're somebody somebody
told to come here

14:58.448 --> 15:00.758
so we can make
a cowboy out of you.

15:02.517 --> 15:03.931
- Something like that.

15:05.206 --> 15:09.586
- It's the most glorious
work you can do

15:09.586 --> 15:11.379
that nobody ever sees.

15:13.034 --> 15:15.275
Takes every inch of you.

15:16.862 --> 15:20.827
You're gonna risk your life
and your horse's life.

15:20.827 --> 15:26.724
And nobody's knows
if you won or if you lost.

15:26.724 --> 15:29.862
It's art...

15:29.862 --> 15:33.758
without an audience
'til the day you die.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.827
And then after you're dead,

15:37.827 --> 15:39.586
you don't have an
audience either.

15:39.586 --> 15:42.793
You just...[pfft]
You're just...you're just gone.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.689
Now, you gotta want this life.

15:50.034 --> 15:53.793
You've got to want it
all the way to your bones.

15:56.586 --> 15:59.482
And if you don't...

15:59.482 --> 16:02.931
it can be absolute
hell on earth.

16:07.103 --> 16:08.551
- I don't know what I want.

16:10.931 --> 16:13.310
- There's a few of us
old goats hanging around.

16:13.310 --> 16:15.827
We'll make sure
you don't starve.

16:15.827 --> 16:19.758
Oh, and quit sleeping
on the ground.

16:19.758 --> 16:23.827
Find yourself
a bench or something.

16:23.827 --> 16:27.965
Otherwise you'll find yourself
cozied up next to a rattlesnake.

16:31.206 --> 16:34.137
- Bench. Got it.
[clears throat]

16:42.827 --> 16:46.241
[music]

16:56.482 --> 16:58.137
- Got me something saddled?

16:58.137 --> 16:59.620
- We're just going to gather
two-year olds.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.724
Hell, we'll be back in
a half an hour.

17:00.724 --> 17:02.551
That's when all the fun starts.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.620
- Well, I ain't breaking no
colts, for crying out loud.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.655
This is the only fun
I get today.

17:07.655 --> 17:10.551
- Boy, let's see
what you've learnt.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.620
Saddle Blaze for Mister Dutton.

17:12.620 --> 17:13.793
- It's already saddled.

17:13.793 --> 17:15.379
- Well, go on and get him.

17:16.517 --> 17:18.275
- Still "boy", huh?

17:18.275 --> 17:21.275
- Yeah, he ain't gonna be around
long enough to name, sir.

17:21.275 --> 17:23.241
- Yeah, well, if he's that bad
at shoveling shit,

17:23.241 --> 17:26.413
I damn sure don't want
him saddling my horse.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.689
- [chuckles]

17:27.689 --> 17:29.551
He can shovel shit
with the best of them,

17:29.551 --> 17:31.448
but he got on the wrong side
of your daughter, though.

17:31.448 --> 17:32.448
- Hmm.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.724
- All right.
- Check your cinch.

17:38.862 --> 17:41.862
- Handsome little sucker,
aren't you?

17:41.862 --> 17:45.655
I bet that's the cause
behind every problem you got.

17:45.655 --> 17:48.482
If I was you I'd find
a way to get ugly.

17:48.482 --> 17:50.137
- Ugly?
- And how.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.827
- Why ugly?

17:51.827 --> 17:55.724
Handsome's the only thing
I got going for me.

more deputies

18:24.551 --> 18:27.068

in Livingston?

18:27.068 --> 18:28.689
Some sort of protest.

18:35.034 --> 18:36.586
Everybody back up.

18:36.586 --> 18:39.862

to a government building.

19:10.137 --> 19:11.551
- You tell me.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.482
They just showed up pouring
blood on themselves

19:12.482 --> 19:13.793
and throwing rocks and shit.

19:13.793 --> 19:15.068
I don't even know what
the fuck they want.

19:15.068 --> 19:16.344

19:16.344 --> 19:17.482
they want the fucking
shit show, Kayce.

19:17.482 --> 19:18.896
And you just gave it to them.

goddamn gun in your holster.

- Sir.

Buckskin filly and dun Colt.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.448
And Walker, you're red rhone.

20:16.586 --> 20:18.241

20:18.241 --> 20:19.827
- I'm working it out.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.310
- Yeah, I see that.
So can the whole ranch.

20:22.310 --> 20:25.034
- Well, they need
to see it, sir.

20:25.034 --> 20:27.620
- I don't want to hear about the
wildfire that got away from you.

20:27.620 --> 20:28.724
Just the one you put out.

20:28.724 --> 20:30.172
- Yessir.

20:30.172 --> 20:32.655
- Whatever he did,
don't forget who he is to you.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.724
To both of us.

20:34.724 --> 20:37.724
- Who he is to us, sir,

20:37.724 --> 20:39.551
is the reason why
he's still walking.

20:47.103 --> 20:50.068
There's what?

20:50.068 --> 20:51.068
Oh, jeez.

20:51.068 --> 20:54.000
All right.
I'm on my way.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.689
Ryan.

20:58.827 --> 21:00.827
Let's go work for the state.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.379
- What happened?

21:02.379 --> 21:03.689
- I don't even know
how to explain it.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.689
[booing, shouting]

21:27.965 --> 21:29.758
- Son, if I spent
a week thinking of ways

21:29.758 --> 21:33.068
to fuck up my day, I could not
have come up with this.

21:33.068 --> 21:35.241
- Where's EMS?

21:35.241 --> 21:36.517
- It ain't blood.

21:36.517 --> 21:37.758
It's paint, I think.

21:37.758 --> 21:40.034
They, uh, poured it
on themselves.

21:40.034 --> 21:43.620
- Poured it on themselves?
- Yep.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.724
- You ever seen anything
like this before?

21:45.724 --> 21:47.413
- Not since my bachelor party.

21:49.655 --> 21:51.655
- Why would you do that?

21:51.655 --> 21:54.103
- Ryan, Ryan,
don't talk to them.

21:57.448 --> 21:58.965
- Was this all by the book?

21:58.965 --> 22:01.827
- 100%, Kayce was assaulted
and rushed by the crowd,

22:01.827 --> 22:04.655
he used justified force
to subdue his assailant.

22:04.655 --> 22:06.103
Hendon came to his aide,

22:06.103 --> 22:07.379
they controlled the crowd
until we got here.

22:10.206 --> 22:11.689
- You got video to back that up?

22:11.689 --> 22:13.241
- Oh, there's
no shortage of video, John.

22:13.241 --> 22:16.241
I'm sure the whole world's
watching this shit as we speak.

22:16.241 --> 22:18.034
- Who's the ring leader
of this circus?

22:18.034 --> 22:19.689
- One on the left, blonde hair.

22:19.689 --> 22:21.448
She's been arrested
in Berkeley, Houston,

22:21.448 --> 22:22.758
Portland, St. Louis...

22:22.758 --> 22:24.586
Disturbing the peace,
failure to disperse.

22:24.586 --> 22:26.655
All dismissed.

22:26.655 --> 22:27.655
- What's her name?

22:27.655 --> 22:30.551
- Summer Higgins.

22:30.551 --> 22:33.379
[shouting]

22:36.551 --> 22:37.965
- You Summer?

22:37.965 --> 22:40.241
- You must be the big boss.

22:40.241 --> 22:41.620
- I'm the retired big boss.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.275
You can see how
that's working out for me.

22:45.241 --> 22:48.137
I can get them blankets
to cover up if they'd like.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.034
- Our bodies are our protest.

22:51.034 --> 22:54.896
They don't want to cover up,
though I can see it bothers you.

22:54.896 --> 22:56.655
Men objectify our breasts,

22:56.655 --> 22:59.034
and then brainwash the world
into thinking

22:59.034 --> 23:01.103
that they should be hidden
to make up for your jealousy

23:01.103 --> 23:03.620
or lack of impulse control,

23:03.620 --> 23:06.103
which is ironic because nature
didn't make them for you.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.172
Nature made them
to feed children,

23:08.172 --> 23:09.689
not your toxic male fantasies.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.241
- I see.

23:11.241 --> 23:12.344
- But that's not why we're here.

23:12.344 --> 23:13.862
- You don't say.

23:13.862 --> 23:15.551
- We're protesting the existence

23:15.551 --> 23:17.655
of a state-sponsored
police force

23:17.655 --> 23:20.310
that protects industrialized
animal farming

23:20.310 --> 23:23.068
and the mass murder of millions
of animals every year.

23:24.344 --> 23:27.172
- You ever plow a field, Summer?

23:27.172 --> 23:28.551
To plant the quinoa or sorghum

23:28.551 --> 23:31.965
or whatever the hell
it is you eat?

23:31.965 --> 23:34.241
You kill everything on
the ground and under it:

23:34.241 --> 23:36.931
you kill every snake,
every frog,

23:36.931 --> 23:39.827
every mouse, mole,
vole, worm, quail...

23:39.827 --> 23:42.931
You kill them all.

23:42.931 --> 23:46.206
So, I guess the only
real question is:

23:46.206 --> 23:47.827
how cute does an animal
have to be

23:47.827 --> 23:49.689
before you care if
it dies to feed you?

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
- What the hell are these people
doing all the way out here?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.103
- Of all the places, doesn't
seem too random, does it.

24:06.655 --> 24:07.689
- What do you want to do, Kayce?

24:11.206 --> 24:12.413
- Press charges.

24:12.413 --> 24:13.931
- That's what they want, John.

24:13.931 --> 24:15.275
I mean, they want to see
this on the goddamn news.

24:15.275 --> 24:16.827
- It's already on the news.

24:16.827 --> 24:18.310
Let them stare five years
in the face

24:18.310 --> 24:21.137
and see how many more
protests they want to plan.

24:23.551 --> 24:25.068
- Okay, all right.

24:26.758 --> 24:29.655
Officer.
Let's get her up.

24:31.965 --> 24:33.620
You're under arrest
for aggravated battery

24:33.620 --> 24:34.862
of a peace officer.

24:34.862 --> 24:36.379
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:36.379 --> 24:37.758
Let's go.

24:37.758 --> 24:40.000
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

24:40.000 --> 24:41.586
in a court of law.

24:41.586 --> 24:43.620
If you don't have a lawyer,
one will be appointed to you.

29:01.068 --> 29:03.137
- Don't know why
everyone calls it morning.

29:03.137 --> 29:06.068
Four a.m. is night time
any way you slice it.

29:07.724 --> 29:10.620
- Yeah, suppose you're right.

29:10.620 --> 29:11.551
Good night.

29:20.965 --> 29:22.620
- What are you doing
out here, babe?

29:24.758 --> 29:27.103
- I'm just kind of tired
of sleeping in that trailer.

29:30.379 --> 29:34.620
Want to sleep out here under the
stars while the weather's good.

29:34.620 --> 29:35.793
If that's all right with you.

29:37.689 --> 29:40.758
- I don't think so.
- No?

29:41.793 --> 29:43.241
- No.

29:43.241 --> 29:47.172
- Why no? You'd rather
sleep in that little box?

29:47.172 --> 29:49.620
- Oh, we can stay out here.

29:51.413 --> 29:53.068
But you're not gettin'
any sleep.

29:53.068 --> 29:54.034
[music]

30:30.137 --> 30:31.862
- [scoffs]

30:42.655 --> 30:45.241
- Eggs over easy, Kayce?

30:45.241 --> 30:47.034
- Yessir, thank you.

30:47.034 --> 30:48.034
- You're welcome.

30:48.034 --> 30:50.724
- Okay, look at this one.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.827
It's in Prior, it's halfway
between here and Bozeman.

30:53.827 --> 30:56.172
It's forty acres.
The house is nice.

30:56.172 --> 30:59.206
I could teach at the rez, get
Tate back with his friends.

31:00.965 --> 31:02.482
- Hey, Dad.

31:02.482 --> 31:04.758
- Hey, buddy.
How you feeling?

31:04.758 --> 31:06.206
- Hungry.

31:06.206 --> 31:09.103
- Four days in a sweat lodge
will do that to you.

31:09.103 --> 31:11.413
- Boy, you ain't lying, Grandpa.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.000
- House looks nice.

31:24.448 --> 31:26.413
- Yeah, I think so too.

31:26.413 --> 31:27.862
- Here you go, Kayce.
- All right.

31:30.551 --> 31:32.103
Grandpa: Okay.

31:42.827 --> 31:43.896
- Not hungry?

31:43.896 --> 31:44.896
- Mm-mm.

31:44.896 --> 31:46.931
I'm intermittent fasting.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.551
- What's that mean?

31:51.551 --> 31:53.758
- Uh, nothing but coffee
and cigarettes 'til noon,

31:53.758 --> 31:55.689
and then I can eat
what the fuck I want

31:55.689 --> 31:58.275
until I start drinking at six.

31:58.275 --> 32:01.344
- I'd like to meet the doctor
who came up with that diet.

32:01.344 --> 32:03.827
- I've adapted it a bit
to suit my lifestyle.

32:05.413 --> 32:06.896
- What are you working on today?

32:06.896 --> 32:10.275
- I got a few irons cooking.

32:10.275 --> 32:12.137
[music]

32:12.137 --> 32:13.103
- What irons?

32:15.896 --> 32:20.517
- I'd rather ask for forgiveness
than permission on these, Daddy.

32:20.517 --> 32:21.827
If you don't mind.

32:21.827 --> 32:24.689
- I do mind.
What irons?

32:28.896 --> 32:31.206
- I'm taking the job
at Market Equities.

32:35.275 --> 32:36.620
- So take the job, then what?

32:39.724 --> 32:40.896
Tell me how that helps us.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.586
- It helps us when I run it
into the fucking ground.

32:49.655 --> 32:50.896
What are you doing today?

32:53.758 --> 32:56.241
- Battling my conscience.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.448
- Mmm.

32:59.379 --> 33:01.620
Well, I'd offer advice, Dad,

33:01.620 --> 33:06.413
but I've never been
in that situation.

33:06.413 --> 33:08.000
[chuckles]

33:08.000 --> 33:09.034
I gotta go.

33:10.896 --> 33:12.551
Love you.
- Mmm.

33:14.896 --> 33:16.482
- Off to ruin a life.

33:17.482 --> 33:19.724
- Okay, honey.

33:19.724 --> 33:24.137
[music]

33:30.068 --> 33:31.068
Fuck it.

33:40.965 --> 33:42.655
[keys jingle]

33:47.068 --> 33:48.827
- You made bail.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.137
- How'd I do that?

33:52.068 --> 33:56.931
[music]

34:10.965 --> 34:11.931
Why'd you bail me out?

34:13.413 --> 34:16.517
- You believe what
you're doing is right.

34:16.517 --> 34:18.965
I disagree but I...

34:18.965 --> 34:20.655
I respect it.

34:20.655 --> 34:22.413
- I can't pay you back.

34:22.413 --> 34:25.000
- Not asking you to.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.655
- You're gonna ask
me something though.

34:28.310 --> 34:32.379
- I'd like to...
I'd like to show you my ranch.

34:34.241 --> 34:35.413
- You think
a tour of your ranch

34:35.413 --> 34:37.965
is gonna change what I believe?

34:37.965 --> 34:40.344
- No, but it might help
you understand me better.

34:40.344 --> 34:44.586
Might help me
understand you, too.

34:44.586 --> 34:47.379
- Surely you can appreciate
that virtually every fiber

34:47.379 --> 34:50.103
of my being is screaming
at me to not get in the pickup

34:50.103 --> 34:52.275
with the charming,
white male in his 50s,

34:52.275 --> 34:55.724
who I don't
know from fucking Adam.

34:55.724 --> 34:58.172
- Charming and in my 50s, huh.

34:58.172 --> 34:59.758
I'm starting to like
you better already.

34:59.758 --> 35:02.137
But I see your point.

35:04.206 --> 35:05.586
It's naive of me.

35:11.586 --> 35:13.965
Don't throw any
more rocks at my son, okay?

35:25.103 --> 35:27.172
- Do I have your word
you're not gonna attack me

35:27.172 --> 35:29.689
and kill me and leave me
in the middle of a forest?

35:32.034 --> 35:34.551
- If my plan was doing all that
I'm probably willing

35:34.551 --> 35:36.413
to break my word.

35:38.551 --> 35:40.137
- I'm going to trust you.

35:40.137 --> 35:41.344
- Good.

35:42.655 --> 35:44.482
I'm gonna trust you, too.

35:44.482 --> 35:45.551
Get in.

35:52.724 --> 35:54.275
[engine starts]

35:57.551 --> 35:59.172
[door buzzes]

35:59.172 --> 36:01.344
[music]

36:14.655 --> 36:15.758
- Full immunity.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.379
- Okay, ask away.

36:23.896 --> 36:25.137
Terrell, you can answer
his questions

36:25.137 --> 36:27.310
without fear of prosecution.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.310
- No matter what I say?

36:29.310 --> 36:32.068
- No matter what you say.
You are a State's Witness.

36:34.137 --> 36:36.206
- What about in here?

36:36.206 --> 36:37.793
Ain't no immunity for a snitch.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.172
- You'll be put
into protective custody.

36:42.172 --> 36:43.862
With good behavior,
we can move you to

36:43.862 --> 36:46.413
a medium security facility
that is significantly

36:46.413 --> 36:47.862
more comfortable
than this place.

36:51.103 --> 36:52.000
- Fire away.

36:57.344 --> 36:58.448
- Do you know this man?

37:04.206 --> 37:07.241
Did this man hire
you to facilitate

37:07.241 --> 37:10.310
the murder attempt
on the Dutton family?

37:10.310 --> 37:12.172
[music]

37:24.862 --> 37:25.896
[knocking]

37:30.793 --> 37:31.896
- Can I help you?

37:40.137 --> 37:42.275
- It's like driving
through a different century.

37:43.965 --> 37:48.517
Are you even aware of the strain
the rest of the world is under?

37:48.517 --> 37:50.034
- I'm aware of the strain here.

37:52.206 --> 37:54.275
- I don't know how much
longer we'll last.

37:54.275 --> 37:56.793
As a people, you know?

37:56.793 --> 37:58.103
I don't think
the planet's going

37:58.103 --> 38:00.551
to tolerate us much longer.

38:00.551 --> 38:03.793
- That's because people
have stopped living with it,

38:03.793 --> 38:06.724
and started living on it.

38:06.724 --> 38:08.413
But you're right.

38:08.413 --> 38:12.896
There will come a time when
Earth sheds us like dead skin.

38:12.896 --> 38:15.000
And it will be our own fault.

38:19.034 --> 38:20.931
- I'm surprised you can
see that from here.

38:24.448 --> 38:26.137
- You can see it
from anywhere, Summer.

38:28.482 --> 38:30.172
It's impossible to miss.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.344
Gayle: Can you accommodate
300 people?

38:46.344 --> 38:48.379
- It's the largest
ranch in Montana.

38:48.379 --> 38:50.482
We can accommodate Denmark.

38:50.482 --> 38:52.275
- The bride is thinking
that during the day

38:52.275 --> 38:54.344
maybe offer trail rides
or hay rides...

38:54.344 --> 38:57.103
- Hay rides at a wedding?

38:57.103 --> 38:58.931
What? They want to fucking
bob for apples

38:58.931 --> 39:01.655
and have sack races too, Gayle?

39:01.655 --> 39:03.413
- They're from New York, Beth.
- Ah.

39:03.413 --> 39:05.793
- They want the ranch
experience.

39:05.793 --> 39:08.000
- Well, I'm just offering
the ranch.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.896
If they want the ranch
experience, price doubles.

39:11.896 --> 39:13.172
- Won't be a problem.

39:13.172 --> 39:15.172
Can you lock
that July 28th date?

39:15.172 --> 39:16.965
- You send me a deposit,
it's all yours.

39:17.965 --> 39:19.482
Gonna lose you.
Gotta go.

39:19.482 --> 39:22.206
[music]

39:22.206 --> 39:24.448
[tires screech]

39:24.448 --> 39:26.655
[ding]

39:28.241 --> 39:29.931
[office phone ringing]

39:29.931 --> 39:31.137
- May I help you?

39:32.344 --> 39:33.310
Excuse me.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Ma'am?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.310
Excuse me.

39:37.310 --> 39:38.827
Excuse me!

39:41.862 --> 39:43.517
I called security.

39:43.517 --> 39:45.241
- That's fine.

39:45.241 --> 39:46.206
Close the door, please.

39:52.206 --> 39:53.413
What do you want, Beth?

39:54.586 --> 39:55.965
- That's my seat.

39:55.965 --> 39:58.517
- Your seat?
- Mm-hmm.

39:58.517 --> 39:59.655
That's right, Bobby.

40:01.034 --> 40:02.862
You're sitting in my seat.

40:02.862 --> 40:04.172
[laughs]

40:04.172 --> 40:07.448
Man, I drove seven hours
just to tell you that.

40:10.965 --> 40:12.862
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:12.862 --> 40:14.689
- I am the new president
of Market Equity's

40:14.689 --> 40:16.896
Montana division.

40:16.896 --> 40:19.931
I oversee all new development.

40:19.931 --> 40:23.586
- Oh. That must be quite
the salary they're paying you.

40:23.586 --> 40:25.379
Congratulations.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.034
- Mm-mm.

40:27.034 --> 40:29.482
No salary, Bob.

40:29.482 --> 40:31.206
No stock options.

40:31.206 --> 40:34.724
No percentage of profit.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.724
I wonder if you can guess

40:37.724 --> 40:40.310
what would entice me
to take a job

40:40.310 --> 40:44.172
doing exactly what my family
have been fighting against

40:44.172 --> 40:45.551
for a century.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.206
- Their interest
in Schwartz and Meyer.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.896
- Their controlling
interest, Bob.

40:58.551 --> 41:01.758
Yeah.
You bet on the wrong horse.

41:09.172 --> 41:10.241
You are fired.

41:17.206 --> 41:18.758
You're fired too,
you nosy bitch.

41:20.172 --> 41:23.172
All this shit,
it's moving to Montana.

41:24.965 --> 41:28.000
[music]

41:59.206 --> 42:01.275
- Hard day at the office?

42:01.275 --> 42:02.758
- Yeah, you could say that.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.241
- That's the problem
with secrets.

42:08.241 --> 42:09.689
They don't stay secret forever.

42:11.793 --> 42:12.931
- No. They don't.

42:14.862 --> 42:16.379
- Care to tell me yours?

42:18.724 --> 42:19.896
- You first.

42:28.620 --> 42:29.689
- You did it.

42:32.068 --> 42:33.137
You got away from him.

42:34.344 --> 42:37.034
You got the job you deserve.

42:37.034 --> 42:39.793
You did everything
you said you would do.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.896
Now, I keep my word.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.551
[baby babbles]

42:53.965 --> 42:55.206
Meet your son.

43:11.827 --> 43:15.862
- Come to think Mr. George,
enjoyed them.

43:15.862 --> 43:17.586
He's been quite
a bunk rider,

43:17.586 --> 43:21.586
and, uh, he got to see
a lot of bunk riding

43:21.586 --> 43:24.655
with Salty Chief.

43:24.655 --> 43:29.137
And I never knew
what that was.

43:29.137 --> 43:32.137
They were powerful horses

43:32.137 --> 43:36.000
if you're off by yourself
in the big country.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.551
You didn't want to get
off of one of 'em.

43:38.551 --> 43:40.103
- No, no, you can't
get back on.

43:40.103 --> 43:42.241
[laughing]

43:42.241 --> 43:44.413
They're liable to go back
to the barn without ya.

43:44.413 --> 43:49.482
- Yeah. Mr. George
appreciated the fact

43:49.482 --> 43:52.137
that they had a little
fire in them.

43:52.137 --> 43:54.931
- Yeah, well, I like them to
have a little bit of fire,

43:54.931 --> 43:59.379
but doggone, you don't want
to have a rodeo every day.

43:59.379 --> 44:01.137
- No.
- [laughs]

44:01.137 --> 44:06.172
- He rode that little
paint blue horse

44:06.172 --> 44:09.379
that he'd bought off
of a foreman

44:09.379 --> 44:11.413
that joined the ranch here

44:11.413 --> 44:14.448
that was sure enough
a little cutting horse.

44:14.448 --> 44:16.758
And, uh...

44:16.758 --> 44:19.586
he worked her a lot.

44:19.586 --> 44:21.896
[music]

44:26.344 --> 44:28.206
- You ready?

44:28.206 --> 44:29.206
- Ready for what?

44:29.206 --> 44:30.965
- Ready for work.

44:30.965 --> 44:32.448
Grab your bag, ol' boy.
Let's go.

44:36.482 --> 44:39.517
Hope you soaked up some
of what you heard in there.

44:39.517 --> 44:41.448
- Soaked up some of what?

44:41.448 --> 44:44.206
- There's three gods in Texas:

44:44.206 --> 44:48.068
the Almighty himself,
Buster Welch, and George Strait.

44:48.068 --> 44:50.103
You just met one of them.

44:51.482 --> 44:53.068
- That's not George Strait.

44:54.551 --> 44:57.241
- I hope the Good Lord
gave you a big dick, Jimmie,

44:57.241 --> 44:59.103
'cause he sure
shorted you on brains.

45:01.206 --> 45:02.310
Can you ride?

45:02.310 --> 45:03.896
- Yeah, I can ride.

45:03.896 --> 45:05.862
