00:01.168 --> 00:03.504
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.754 --> 00:05.840
- <i>Phil Coulson is dying.</i>
- Can we cure this?

00:06.007 --> 00:08.592
The tissue is already dead.
There is no cure for that.

00:08.843 --> 00:11.178
Ruby, when they resurface,
I'll put an end to all of this.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.681
This entire S.H.I.E.L.D. chapter
will be over.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.352
<i>Your work was incomplete.</i>

00:19.270 --> 00:22.148
At least the beacon will do
what it's supposed to do.

00:23.607 --> 00:27.236
I think that when the monoliths exploded,
they tore open a fear dimension.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.947
<i>And I was hoping there was enough
gravitonium to stitch together</i>

00:30.114 --> 00:31.240
<i>the tear in space-time.</i>

00:34.452 --> 00:37.830
Deke Shaw could possibly be an LMD.
I ran a genetic profile to see

00:37.997 --> 00:40.750
- if he was biologically linked to anyone.
- And it came up with a match?

00:40.958 --> 00:41.959
No.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.794
It came up with two.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.183
Have you heard of Thorazine, Alex?

00:59.685 --> 01:02.104
I only mention it because that's
what they're proposing for you.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.814
High dose.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.693
Much more aggressive treatment than
what you're taking in the mornings now.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.820
And I'm the one holding them back.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.906
Because I feel for you.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.493
I don't think
that you're a violent person.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.245
A few outbursts don't define you.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.083
But you need to open up about the trauma
that led you here.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.376
Starting with your father's abuse.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.170
And then torture

01:26.337 --> 01:27.797
at the hands of Mr Ward.

01:28.839 --> 01:29.965
Then S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.426
I remember everything.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.429
That's a start.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.849
But we need to drill down
on how that makes you feel.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.393
Show them some improvement.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.106
So they don't drug you to the point
where thoughts are hard to come by.

01:45.856 --> 01:46.857
Okay?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.278
So... we can start anywhere.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.449
April.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.244
Okay. What happened in April?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.333
April...

02:05.876 --> 02:07.878
your daughter, just turned three.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.507
- I never spoke about...
- Six weeks ago,

02:11.715 --> 02:14.260
during our Tuesday session,
it was raining.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.387
<i>You always prop the window open
with a pen.</i>

02:16.554 --> 02:17.721
<i>Your wife called</i>

02:17.888 --> 02:19.390
<i>and you answered after one ring.</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:21.976
Tight leash, huh?

02:22.977 --> 02:27.148
You stepped outside to talk.
The door is not as thick as you think.

02:28.274 --> 02:31.777
April had a fever... 103.2.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.113
All those kids at the parties,

02:34.363 --> 02:36.866
a lot of germs.
You said you'd be home early.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.202
513 Elm Drive, right?

02:41.453 --> 02:42.538
You know where I live?

02:42.872 --> 02:44.498
<i>You should really be
more careful.</i>

02:44.790 --> 02:46.959
You never know what someone might do
with that information.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.675
I told you. I remember everything.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.054
I'd like that Thorazine now, please.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.195
Everything is stabilising,
back in normal range. Bit of good news.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.487
How's the pain?

03:16.447 --> 03:18.490
Nothing I can't handle. Thank you.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.994
- Well, how's this? You okay?
- It's fine.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.204
Good, okay.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.790
Well...
...you need to stay warm.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.711
- Can I get you anything to eat?
- Mack, enough.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.714
Seriously, if I had arms,
I would strangle you right now.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.384
How's the patient?

03:37.635 --> 03:39.261
- Cranky.
- How are you feeling?

03:40.512 --> 03:43.390
The same way I was feeling before
you knew anything was wrong with me.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.893
Thank you for asking,
but please, stop asking.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.396
Fitz is gonna do the best prosthetics work
he's ever done for you,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.190
but it may take some time.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.444
We don't have the materials he needs here,
but we're gonna find a way to get them.

03:55.778 --> 03:58.572
In the meantime, I need you
to focus on resting and healing.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.077
- Sitting still isn't my strong suit.
- I know. But he'll make it worth the wait.

04:03.494 --> 04:07.414
See? People can't even tell
the difference, and honestly,

04:07.623 --> 04:08.874
this one's way more fun.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.876
- He's always adding...
- Does it feel the same?

04:14.546 --> 04:15.589
Actually, no.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.801
It doesn't feel at all,
but you get used to it.

04:20.261 --> 04:23.138
How are you gonna feel about
dating someone with robot parts?

04:24.682 --> 04:26.308
Those aren't the parts that matter.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.478
- Mack!
- What? Oh, no. Come on.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.438
That's not what I meant.
What I meant was,

04:31.605 --> 04:35.192
that the thing I hate about robots
is that they have no heart, no soul.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.820
Those are the parts that matter.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.990
Nice save. And sweet.

04:41.991 --> 04:44.076
Okay, you can be annoying again.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.078
It's my turn now.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.872
Time to break up this party.
You need rest.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.668
- I need a beer.
- I'll see what I can do about that.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.587
In the meantime,
you listen to the doc, all right?

05:04.305 --> 05:07.141
We need to get out of here
and get Fitz what he needs to fix her.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.685
I know, Mack. But it's one of many
pressing concerns.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.146
- I was just coming to see you.
- Tidings of comfort and joy?

05:12.396 --> 05:13.647
Warnings of doom and gloom.

05:13.856 --> 05:17.276
The, uh, gravitonium device that we used
to seal the Rift is barely strong enough.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.361
It's duct tape on the Hoover Dam.
It's not gonna hold.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.113
How much time
before the dam starts leaking?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.115
Well, uh,
it's hard to calculate that precisely,

05:23.282 --> 05:26.869
but based on the increased frequency
of transient electromagnetic waves...

05:28.203 --> 05:31.081
I'd say that our days are numbered.
S... Sorry. That was insensitive.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.500
No. It wasn't. It's part of life.
We're all gonna die.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.668
Right now, we need to make sure

05:34.835 --> 05:36.295
it doesn't happen
to the entire planet all at once.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.048
Right, so we need more gravitonium
to seal the Rift for good, right?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.091
Yeah, but that's something
we haven't seen on this side of the future

05:41.258 --> 05:42.634
in a long time. Sir...

05:43.927 --> 05:46.305
I really think that
we should have everybody on this.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.599
- We do.
- Let's not forget about Yo-Yo.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.225
She can't help until we help her.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.811
Daisy's hoping we can tackle both problems
with one solution.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.689
Cybertek.

05:56.148 --> 05:59.276
The last time anyone saw gravitonium
in this timeline was at Cybertek's lab,

05:59.443 --> 06:01.862
which happens to be the same company
that built Deathlok's leg.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.739
- Now we're talking.
- Cybertek was dissolved.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.576
Quinn's vanished, Raina's dead,
gravitonium is still MIA.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.244
Yeah. But we found the names
of the scientists

06:09.411 --> 06:11.997
- who worked under Ian Quinn. So...
- Who's Ian Quinn?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.083
Rich guy, bad guy.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.962
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm not part of the club?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.924
I'm sorry, I'll just go get my things
and I'll go grab a cheeseburger.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.759
Have a seat, Deke. I invited him.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.677
He's seen more gravitonium
than any of us.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.638
He may have some insight that we don't.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.725
Okay. So, this is Quinn's gravitonium guy,
Dr Joseph Getty.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.394
Also dead. We chased that lead.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.937
Right,
but here's where it gets interesting.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.898
All of Cybertek's scientists are now dead,
within the past two years,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.442
and all of their death certificates
were signed by one man...

06:41.610 --> 06:43.237
Murray Jacobson.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.947
What, so you think it's a cover-up?
They're still alive?

06:45.114 --> 06:47.199
Yeah, it smells like it.
But this photo is all I could find on him.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.575
You ran facial recognition?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.954
I did, and I found his mug associated
with multiple aliases,

06:52.204 --> 06:56.625
the most recent being Lewis Casalino,
a real-estate agent in Baton Rouge.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.127
We need to talk to him.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.754
So, we're going outside?

07:00.921 --> 07:04.133
Yeah, they're kind of sparing no expense
looking for you guys.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.302
We'll leave under cover of night.
It's a risk we have to take.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.098
If he can help us find Dr Getty,
we may get a lead on gravitonium.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.725
- Yeah. I'm going with you.
- I thought you grounded yourself?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.353
Yeah, I can't really destroy the world
without my powers, so...

07:16.520 --> 07:20.065
- I can take care of myself.
- I know. I just want some fresh air.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.569
Great. Well, fresh air for all of us.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.112
- Have a seat, Deke.
- Okay.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.323
I need you to stay here.
See if you can help Fitz.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.286
What... No. Come... I'm not a babysitter.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.999
Do you've any idea how high my IQ is?
Actually, neither do I.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.418
Nobody actually cared about that
in the future.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.254
Intelligence was measured
by how long you can survive.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.881
Then be smart and stay here.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.931
Hello.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.060
Hey!

09:20.644 --> 09:21.728
What is this place?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.319
Hey!

09:30.362 --> 09:31.488
Where are we?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.456
Lewis Casalino?

09:42.291 --> 09:46.253
AKA Murray Jacobson, William Pratt,
Gene Klein, Marion Cobretti...

09:58.307 --> 09:59.808
He's armed and he's coming your way.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.787
- Show yourself or I'll drop you.
- Drop the gun. We just wanna talk.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.540
- You heard him. Drop the gun.
- Listen, Lady Cakes,

10:23.749 --> 10:28.211
I take orders from two people,
no one and not you.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.131
Candy Man?

10:33.884 --> 10:34.968
Mack Hammer?

10:37.095 --> 10:40.766
Well, I'll be damned. Do I owe you money?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.434
Hey, it's probably
the other way around, brother.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.606
- Ha! It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.904
There he is.

10:54.071 --> 10:57.783
Tony "Candy Man" Caine. We were roommates
freshmen year at the Academy.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.242
Why'd they call you Candy Man?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.578
You know, Tony was the kind of guy
who could get you anything.

11:01.912 --> 11:05.582
Fake IDs, backstage passes,
test answers.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.503
What did I get for all my troubles?
Booted from the Academy.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.879
Well, you also never went to class.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.633
Yeah, well, I really wasn't the books
and tests kinda guy. That was Mack.

11:14.925 --> 11:18.970
Never missed a class, never broke a rule.
They called us the Saint and the Sinner.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.348
Wait, could we get back
to Mack Hammer, please?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.975
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He made the mistake of telling us

11:24.142 --> 11:26.478
that he was obsessed with MC Hammer
in high school.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.480
- Okay.
- Wait. Where is your picture?

11:29.106 --> 11:30.649
- Oh, my, my.
- Don't.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.820
- Can't. I can't un-see that, Mack.
- All right, this does not leave the plane.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.614
Guys, guys, I'm guessing
you didn't track me down to relive

11:37.823 --> 11:40.575
- good memories and awesome haircuts.
- You're right.

11:41.243 --> 11:44.830
We're looking for a Cybertek scientist
named Joseph Getty.

11:45.080 --> 11:49.042
- And why would I know him?
- You signed his death certificate.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.712
If he's still alive,
he may have valuable information for us.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.589
It could help us keep the world
from shattering into a billion pieces.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.386
Uh... Okay.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.015
You guys ever hear of Project Paperclip?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.727
Secret program to recruit Nazi scientists

12:06.893 --> 12:08.353
- after World War Two.
- Yeah.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.814
And the exact same thing happened
with Hydra.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.817
For those worthy of a second chance,
it was my job

12:13.984 --> 12:17.738
to give them new identities, new lives,
erase the old ones.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.116
- So, you know where he is.
- We need to talk to him, Tony.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.953
Well, if the Mack Hammer's willing
to break the rules,

12:25.120 --> 12:26.621
this has got to be bad.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.914
Doomsday bad.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.667
Following the rules
is no longer an option.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.546
Look what I found in storage.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.091
Baseball, right?

12:39.384 --> 12:42.804
Everybody have really big hands?
'Cause this is crazy.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.306
There's another one if you wanna play.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.099
I'm monitoring
a highly volatile situation.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.395
Well, yeah, I'm trying to help.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.939
You don't have to be such a cranky old man
about it.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.275
If you're stuck on a problem,
you should take a break.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.278
My mum used to tell me about this guy
named Albert Einstein.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.989
He says that play is the highest form
of research.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.241
I'm not gonna play catch with you.
I've got stuff to...

13:03.658 --> 13:04.743
Okay?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.538
Well, why don't I stay here and stare
at the numbers for a little while.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.458
You can go visit Mrs Fitz.
You guys just got married,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.126
all the grown-ups are gone,
I bet she's just dying

13:13.293 --> 13:14.503
for a little post-wedding yee-haw.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.087
Okay, do you know what, Einstein?
You're right.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.049
I need a break, so let's play ball.
Let's play ball, come on.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.594
Okay, toss me the ball. We'll play fetch.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.721
Ready?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.726
Damn, it's happening again.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.190
We are experiencing another Anomaly Flare.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.692
<i>If you see something
that doesn't belong here...</i>

13:38.401 --> 13:39.486
<i>it's not real.</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:41.321
<i>Kill it by any means necessary.</i>

13:47.577 --> 13:49.287
Hey. What happened?

13:49.496 --> 13:53.291
- Are you okay?
- I woke up. I forgot I didn't have arms.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.628
- Okay. Let's just get you back up then.
- Please...

13:57.212 --> 13:58.255
leave me alone.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.676
I just wanna sit here.

14:10.225 --> 14:14.020
I wanna be with Mack forever
and I wanna have children with him.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.188
And you will.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.442
- This doesn't change anything.
- Look at me.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.029
What I saw...

14:24.698 --> 14:25.740
what I heard...

14:26.616 --> 14:27.784
it's all happening.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.248
- There's no future but the one we saw.
- No, that's not true. Hey.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.585
We can change it.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.504
We will change it.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.674
No.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.510
Nothing's gonna change it.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.305
You're different, man.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.308
Wow, you hated violence.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.228
Now look at this.
You got this shotgun axe thing,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.480
you're one of America's most wanted.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.817
I mean, it's badass and everything,
don't get me wrong.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.029
But, dude, what happened?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.074
There are a lot of dark things
going on in this world

15:08.241 --> 15:10.201
that people should never have to see.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.332
I won't let the people I love
get hurt by it.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.585
Not anymore.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.463
So that's why you're asking
about the Deathlok program?

15:22.797 --> 15:24.841
I'm sorry, man. It's a dead end.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.472
I know Cybertek coerced a lot of people,
but I'm still not sure

15:30.639 --> 15:32.766
how I feel about a bunch
of their scientists

15:33.016 --> 15:34.809
getting clean slates and walking among us.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.355
What if one of them
has the key to saving you?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.320
You were hoping Cybertek could solve
more than two problems.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.822
I am not gonna be the next John Garrett.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.824
- The answer's no.
- Okay, just hear me out for a second.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.702
Cybertek had a whole team of people
whose only job was to keep Garrett alive.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.120
What if one of them
could do the same for you?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.374
- Absolutely not. That's an order.
- If there's a chance to save your life,

15:57.582 --> 15:59.334
- why not try?
- Because...

15:59.751 --> 16:02.963
I already had one unnatural life extension
and I don't want another.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.048
You both have to accept that.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.181
- Not gonna happen.
- Not a chance.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.685
He was our shield when we needed it,
and like it or not,

16:17.352 --> 16:18.561
we're gonna be his.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.783
Come on in, join the party.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.162
You can talk.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.164
When I feel like it.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.085
What is this place?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.340
A safe house.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.469
- Why are you here?
- I live here.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.722
Why am I here?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.851
You'll get all of your questions answered
when you get them answered.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.937
From who?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.522
Mother.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.195
What?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.531
You still have that scar?

17:14.159 --> 17:15.910
The one you got when you were a kid.

17:17.787 --> 17:18.829
How did you know?

17:20.498 --> 17:21.708
We used to play together.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.377
Ruby, right?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.253
I don't remember you.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.883
You hit your head on the kitchen counter.
That's how you got it.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.470
- I remember the floor...
- Black and white checkers.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.139
I was supposed to be watching you
so, I got blamed.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.767
My father beat me in front of you...

17:40.185 --> 17:41.269
and your mother.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.564
I wanna see her.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.399
Now.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.623
Oh, this can't be good.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.126
Did they find me?
Do I have to relocate again?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.879
Everything's okay.
This isn't an official visit.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.924
I just need you to help me find something.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.926
What?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.303
Gravitonium.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.473
It's okay. He's an old friend of mine.
You can trust him.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.058
He's one of the good guys.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.434
I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.814
No, no, no. They're the bad guys now.
I can't be seen talking to a criminal.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.607
Says the guy who used to work for Hydra.

18:27.982 --> 18:31.903
Listen, he had to work for 'em.
They were threatening to kill his family.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.823
I'm sorry.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.909
Look, I still regret everything
I did for them.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.078
But I'm paying for my sins.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.164
Saving the world will pay for them all.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.547
- What do you need to know?
- What happened to the gravitonium?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.759
They put it on a cargo ship,

18:55.176 --> 18:58.263
the <i>Principia,</i> to transport it
to a facility in the Pacific, but...

18:59.514 --> 19:01.516
- never made it.
- Why? What happened?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.977
It sank during a thunderstorm.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.480
If you want gravitonium,
you're gonna have to reach five miles down

19:07.647 --> 19:08.815
into the ocean to get it.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.486
We're looking in an area
that they already searched.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.738
There's nothing there.
I expanded the search range

19:15.905 --> 19:18.158
a hundred miles in every direction
from the coordinates

19:18.324 --> 19:21.786
which it last made contact.
Bathymetric maps don't show anything,

19:22.328 --> 19:26.791
sonar doesn't pick up any deviations.
So, maybe they were hijacked by pirates.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.251
<i>He said it went down in a storm.</i>

19:28.459 --> 19:31.004
Did you ever consider he might be lying?
He was Hydra.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.923
<i>Mack believes him. Keep looking.</i>

19:38.970 --> 19:40.430
Look at all that water.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.937
Hey, you should get some rest.
You haven't slept all night.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.522
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just...

19:50.356 --> 19:52.817
I don't know where else to look.
And even if we do find it,

19:52.984 --> 19:54.319
I don't know how we salvage it
from that depth.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.737
How deep?

19:56.946 --> 19:59.407
- Five miles where we're looking.
- Five miles?

19:59.991 --> 20:01.701
Are you serious?
What's it like down there?

20:01.868 --> 20:02.994
- It's cold.
- Dark.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.622
So, did you guys go visit?
Like on holiday?

20:05.872 --> 20:08.458
- Do they have hotels, or is that...?
- Okay, you know what? Just go.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.920
Please, please just go,
because you are giving me a headache.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.006
I'm sorry that
I have never seen an ocean before.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.884
Where I was born,
you guys already blew up the planet,

20:18.051 --> 20:20.094
so, thank you very much for your service.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.142
He never stops.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.102
It's like somebody let Scrappy-Doo
in here.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.146
Yeah, but you can't be so hard on him.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.150
We both know what it's like
to be pulled into a strange world.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.612
Plus, he has exquisite taste
in wedding rings.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.451
Can you believe that we're married?

20:44.118 --> 20:47.121
- Wife?
- I cannot, husband.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.874
Do you think we'll ever get used to it,
husband?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.502
No, I do not, wife.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.840
Hey, I was thinking,
we should hyphenate our last name, yeah?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.009
Uh...

21:00.343 --> 21:04.055
Yeah. Of course.
Mr and Mrs Simmons-Fitz.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.807
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.101
- Just rolls right off the tongue.
- Yeah, right off.

21:18.653 --> 21:19.654
Let her go...

21:21.155 --> 21:22.407
or they will kill you.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.909
Why am I here?

21:25.493 --> 21:28.788
They wanted to chemically lobotomise you,
so I had you transferred.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.581
Maybe that's what I wanted.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.678
It's good to see you, Werner,
after all these years.

21:45.596 --> 21:46.723
It's Alex.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.474
Alex Braun.

21:49.183 --> 21:52.937
I don't want anything to do with my father
or his name. Or Hydra.

21:55.690 --> 21:58.776
Hydra.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.778
Such a boy's club.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.199
So much testosterone.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.454
If you're not Hydra,
why were you always visiting my father?

22:10.538 --> 22:12.498
Oh, we had overlapping interests
back then.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.711
But I hated his guts,
if we're being honest.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.465
I can use you, Alex.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.968
I know what you can do,
'cause I've read your S.H.I.E.L.D. file...

22:25.219 --> 22:26.679
your psych evaluations...

22:28.264 --> 22:29.766
I pieced it all together.

22:32.185 --> 22:35.396
S.H.I.E.L.D. zapped your brain
when you were in the memory enhancer.

22:35.897 --> 22:39.609
Something was bound to happen.
I mean, how much do you remember?

22:39.776 --> 22:42.945
What you mean is how much
do I remember that my father said,

22:43.196 --> 22:46.699
- or did or wrote down.
- It's valuable information.

22:48.743 --> 22:52.330
And your father is one of the reasons
that Hydra went off the rails.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.333
See, what I'm building here
is something new,

22:55.875 --> 22:58.836
a better future for you.
For you and for Ruby.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.589
Can you help me do that, Alex?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.052
Go to hell!

23:08.888 --> 23:10.723
I am so sorry you feel that way.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.893
Kill me. I don't care.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.449
I'm not gonna kill you, Alex.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.829
Tomorrow morning, they'll take you
wherever it is you wanna go.

23:36.374 --> 23:37.542
You're free. Go.

23:41.504 --> 23:42.713
It's my gift to you.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.974
Gain his trust...

23:54.475 --> 23:55.476
his love...

23:56.477 --> 24:00.231
whatever it is you need to do to get
inside his head. We need that information.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.108
Uh. Ruby...

24:03.484 --> 24:04.861
stick to the books this time.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.697
Don't you go off the rails.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.136
Oh, my God.

24:33.181 --> 24:35.892
I have got to meet the chef
that invented these.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.602
<i>Deke.</i>

24:42.064 --> 24:43.357
Who's there?

24:52.033 --> 24:54.368
- Mum?
- There you are, sweetie.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.955
- I have been looking all over for you.
- You're not...

24:58.873 --> 25:01.751
- Not real. Not real.
- Put that down.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.669
You'll cut yourself.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.718
Are you getting enough to eat here?

25:15.389 --> 25:16.849
I see you're making some friends.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.478
- I don't know if I'd call them friends.
- You like them.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.313
I can tell.

25:24.273 --> 25:28.319
- Some, maybe.
- That Daisy girl is cute.

25:28.903 --> 25:33.449
- Mum. No, she's not. Stop it.
- Remember, sweetie...

25:34.325 --> 25:36.494
the steps you take don't need to be big,

25:36.661 --> 25:37.995
- they just need to take you...
- Just need to take you...

25:38.162 --> 25:39.539
- ...in the right direction.
- ...in the right direction.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.291
You always used to say that.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.461
And my mum said it to me.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.797
So, what are you saying?
You're saying that I...

25:47.964 --> 25:49.257
You should walk away.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.594
You know what happens
when you care about someone.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.807
No!

26:11.988 --> 26:13.906
- Deke?
- Oh.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.702
You okay?

26:18.411 --> 26:19.662
You look like you've had a fright.

26:20.329 --> 26:24.292
I just saw
another one of those fear things.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.377
I need a Zima.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.880
You shouldn't be alone.
Come back to Control. Fitz didn't mean...

26:30.047 --> 26:31.340
Fitz thinks I'm an idiot!

26:31.966 --> 26:34.343
Like I don't know up from down.
Well, tell him I'm sorry

26:34.510 --> 26:37.179
that I was born in a place
that doesn't have oceans or air, or...

26:38.139 --> 26:40.558
You know, and technically,
there is no up and down in space,

26:40.725 --> 26:43.060
it's all the same thing.
So, you can tell him to take all that

26:43.311 --> 26:45.938
science mumbo-jumbo and shove it up...

26:48.774 --> 26:49.775
Wait.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.195
It's all the same thing.

26:56.741 --> 26:57.825
Hey!

26:58.242 --> 26:59.994
You need to look up in the sky!

27:00.369 --> 27:05.207
Our ships float and sink, they don't fly.
I'm sorry, Deke, but those are spaceships.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.753
But what if this ship can fly.
It was carrying gravitonium

27:08.919 --> 27:10.921
during a storm.
If it got hit by lightning...

27:11.088 --> 27:13.215
- It could've charged the gravitonium.
- And generated a gravity field

27:13.382 --> 27:14.800
around the entire ship.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.388
Okay. Well, if it rose up
into the atmosphere,

27:19.555 --> 27:21.432
it would've been tossed about
by air currents all these years.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.142
- It could be anywhere.
- Yes, so we need to analyse

27:23.309 --> 27:26.729
wind and weather patterns, air currents,
starting from the night it disappeared,

27:26.896 --> 27:31.150
- and try and build a workable algorithm.
- Yeah. That. Let's do all that.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.367
Anything?

27:40.034 --> 27:41.035
Yeah.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.788
- More clouds.
- We're looking for a needle in a haystack.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.547
Or a flying boat.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.550
You gotta be kidding me.

27:58.094 --> 27:59.970
Holy moly!

28:02.056 --> 28:03.891
You guys see stuff like this all the time?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.226
Mm-hm. Pretty much.

28:05.393 --> 28:06.435
- Yeah.
- Yep.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.277
Oh!

28:16.237 --> 28:17.738
Get... Get away!

28:28.749 --> 28:29.959
I heard screaming.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.631
I don't just remember words and facts.

28:38.676 --> 28:39.677
I remember pain.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.681
Every beating I've ever taken.

28:44.807 --> 28:45.808
Like it's new.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.770
Over and over.

28:53.441 --> 28:54.442
Well, that...

28:56.068 --> 28:57.862
has gotta suck.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.870
I never knew my father...

29:08.748 --> 29:09.874
but my mother...

29:11.250 --> 29:12.418
she is a tyrant.

29:14.879 --> 29:18.048
Keeps me locked up here
and makes me do things that...

29:18.799 --> 29:20.050
I don't wanna do.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.139
She's using me to get to you.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.103
Everything I did, ignoring you...

29:32.354 --> 29:33.564
letting you touch me...

29:34.732 --> 29:36.025
taking me hostage...

29:38.569 --> 29:39.779
that was all planned.

29:42.198 --> 29:45.701
The grand seduction
of Werner Von Strucker.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.288
Gain his trust...

29:50.498 --> 29:52.082
by any means necessary.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.046
You made the right decision.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.133
She doesn't care about you. Or me.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.094
She only wants what's in your head.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.306
But whatever she's planning,

30:07.473 --> 30:10.351
it's not gonna be any different
than Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:12.770 --> 30:13.854
Unless...

30:16.065 --> 30:17.066
Unless what?

30:18.400 --> 30:20.194
It doesn't have to be her team.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.365
It could be our team...

30:27.618 --> 30:29.829
only she wouldn't know
until it was too late.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.747
I don't wanna be a part of any team.

30:32.915 --> 30:36.836
- I just wanna go somewhere far away.
- With all of those bad memories?

30:38.504 --> 30:42.675
Maybe the key is to bury them under...

30:43.342 --> 30:45.928
newer, happier memories.

30:54.395 --> 30:55.771
If you're not here tomorrow...

30:59.942 --> 31:01.193
I'll understand.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.407
But if you are...

31:25.259 --> 31:26.385
<i>Davis has us in hover mode.</i>

31:26.552 --> 31:27.970
<i>You sure you don't need me down there?</i>

31:28.137 --> 31:30.222
We need someone on the thing
that's actually supposed to be in the air

31:30.389 --> 31:31.807
in case the bottom drops out on us.

31:32.016 --> 31:34.852
And I trust you way more than Davis
to fly that crazy rescue.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.896
I hear you and don't disagree.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.607
<i>Hey, Coulson,
don't forget to breathe your oxygen.</i>

31:39.773 --> 31:41.692
<i>Five minutes without it,
you'll get really loopy.</i>

31:42.568 --> 31:45.571
Okay. Cameras on.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.198
- May, Fitz, you reading this?
- Copy that.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.534
- Crystal clear.
- Yeah. Copy that. Looking good.

31:51.035 --> 31:54.038
<i>Gotta admit, it's kinda cool.
Walking around on a ship</i>

31:54.204 --> 31:57.583
<i>- 25,000 feet up in the sky.
- Fitz, how is this even possible?</i>

31:57.750 --> 32:01.420
When the gravitonium was supercharged,
most likely by a lightning strike,

32:01.587 --> 32:03.547
it created an applied gravity field
on the ship.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.215
Same way the Gravity Puck works.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.718
That means there's gotta be gravitonium
there somewhere.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.512
<i>Well, deck one is clear.</i>

32:20.481 --> 32:21.982
I think we found the crew.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.030
That looks like severe hypoxia.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.992
Just keep moving.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.638
We're in the engine room.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.974
Looks like someone's been here before us.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.069
Coulson.

33:07.778 --> 33:08.862
Where's the gravitonium?

33:09.446 --> 33:11.532
<i>Whoever they were,
they didn't go home empty-handed.</i>

33:13.993 --> 33:16.412
What's keeping the ship in the air
if there's no gravitonium?

33:17.454 --> 33:18.580
It's not possible.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.835
- Guys, get down here!
- What is it?

33:30.509 --> 33:31.552
Gravitonium.

33:32.761 --> 33:33.929
Not all of it though.

33:34.972 --> 33:36.765
It's about the size of a softball.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.351
Must've got separated from the rest.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.563
Okay, well, it might be enough
for the air, but there's a problem.

33:42.730 --> 33:45.649
<i>- There is always a problem.</i>
- You can't touch it or move it.

33:45.816 --> 33:48.193
It's generating the gravity field
that's keeping you in the air.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.655
<i>- We're not gonna leave it here.</i>
- Is there a plastic box anywhere?

33:53.991 --> 33:56.285
- Yeah. We got something. Why?
<i>- Okay. Listen to me.</i>

33:56.452 --> 33:59.538
<i>If you can box it up without touching it,
you might be able to get it off the ship.</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:01.165
- Might?
<i>- You got about 90 seconds</i>

34:01.331 --> 34:02.416
<i>before the gravity field dissipates.</i>

34:02.624 --> 34:04.418
After that,
real gravity is gonna take over

34:04.585 --> 34:06.336
and the ship's gonna fall out of the sky.

34:06.712 --> 34:07.963
Should be enough time.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.049
All right.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.306
Hey, Mack Hammer?

34:18.306 --> 34:19.308
Can't touch this.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.143
- Now is not the time.
- Sorry. Couldn't resist.

34:32.446 --> 34:33.447
Clock's ticking.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.991
Let's go before this floating ship drops
miles into the ocean.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.623
I'm on a mission
with the two things I fear most,

34:43.206 --> 34:44.666
drowning and heights.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.380
No, make that three things.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.138
- What are those things?
- One of Hale's flying monkeys.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.473
There's another one.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.228
<i>They've got us flanked.</i>

35:06.396 --> 35:07.523
Mack!

35:11.443 --> 35:13.862
They need to get off that ship.
They don't have much time.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.834
You've got less than a minute.
Get the hell out of that ship!

35:27.000 --> 35:28.168
<i>Working on it.</i>

35:31.588 --> 35:32.798
Oh.

35:38.846 --> 35:39.847
Mack, run for it.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.432
Go to the Module.
I'll take care of these guys.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.601
- We gotta get out!
- We don't have time for this.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.854
Go! I know what I'm doing.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.190
It's hammer time.

36:01.285 --> 36:04.037
This is not the Mack
I used to know.

36:08.292 --> 36:11.253
I'm on my way in.
And I'm bringing a couple of guests.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.435
- General Hale?
- What is it?

36:26.935 --> 36:29.563
Some of the old Sleeper Mechs
recently came back online.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.481
Which ones?

36:31.732 --> 36:34.234
The ones you left on the <i>Principia</i>
in case anyone found 'em.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.611
We should have blown that
out of the sky

36:35.777 --> 36:37.487
- when we had the chance.
- No, it's too risky.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.199
We don't know enough
about the gravitonium.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.992
It could've responded
like a nuclear reactor

36:42.159 --> 36:45.579
- and set the ozone on fire.
- Well, now someone knows about it. Who?

36:46.330 --> 36:47.372
S.H.I.E.L.D.

36:49.124 --> 36:53.337
You know, I wouldn't have believed
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.633
Thanks again for your help, Mr Caine.
Sorry we had to drag you along.

36:57.799 --> 37:02.429
I got to see a flying boat
and a robot fight. Best day ever.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.264
We'll have someone take you home
in a Quinjet when you're ready.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.974
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

37:07.768 --> 37:09.811
Good to see you again, Tony. Take care.

37:10.062 --> 37:13.523
Good to see you too, Mack.
And hey, about that Deathlok program,

37:13.690 --> 37:15.567
your friends were asking about it too.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.987
So, I'm gonna do some diggin'.
See what else I can find.

37:19.529 --> 37:22.324
- Anything, no matter how small.
- You got it.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.087
I'm sorry about yesterday.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.549
I don't know who that was.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.971
No need to apologise.
Recovery takes a toll.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.889
Physically and emotionally.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.979
I'm just trying to not lose faith.

37:55.649 --> 37:56.858
We're gonna change things.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.569
That's the spirit.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.827
Oh, I'm just holding onto that thing
in case of emergency.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.788
But don't beat yourself up
while you're trying to heal.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.581
Go slow.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.251
The steps you take
don't need to be big,

38:14.459 --> 38:16.420
they just need to take you
in the right direction.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.676
Oh, can we help you with something?

38:25.721 --> 38:28.307
What's wrong, Deke?
Did you see another ghost from your past?

38:29.141 --> 38:30.767
No, it wasn't a ghost. I...

38:39.401 --> 38:41.111
I saw you standing there, and...

38:44.323 --> 38:45.407
How are you?

38:46.867 --> 38:50.704
Would... I...
And, um, they're... they're...

38:51.621 --> 38:54.041
They're back.
That's what I came to tell you.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.003
Okay.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.684
What?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.522
Nothing. Is that a new sweater?

39:22.110 --> 39:23.904
- Yo-Yo.
- Hey, you're up.

39:26.823 --> 39:27.991
One ball of gravitonium.

39:28.950 --> 39:29.951
Thank you.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.747
Deke, are you coming?
Or is this another play day?

39:34.623 --> 39:38.418
- Yeah, after you, Grandpa.
- I think they're growing on each other.

39:38.752 --> 39:41.171
I just hope there's enough gravitonium
for them to work with.

39:41.505 --> 39:43.256
And I think it's safe to say
General Hale has the rest.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.967
I'm starting to think she's more
than just an overzealous general.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.177
I think you're right.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.307
Guess what I got you?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.185
I don't know. I'm stumped.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.188
Oh, so we're doing those jokes now?
No. No more of that.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.649
Or I won't share these with you.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.443
That's right, I got you somethin' else.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.119
Arms.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.948
I thought about what you said.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.285
You're right...

40:54.202 --> 40:55.370
the future's ours.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.377
Then you should see who else we've got.

41:12.429 --> 41:14.473
One of your father's old experiments.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.934
But I don't need to tell you that.

41:19.728 --> 41:20.979
You remember everything.

41:37.954 --> 41:38.997
Nice work.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.625
How did you convince him to stay?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.586
I told him the truth.
