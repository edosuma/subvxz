00:00.341 --> 00:03.284
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.485 --> 00:07.046
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.116 --> 00:09.443
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.511 --> 00:12.009
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.074 --> 00:14.340
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.407 --> 00:16.505
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.573 --> 00:19.740
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.808 --> 00:22.385
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.453 --> 00:23.990
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.057 --> 00:25.624
Should we shoot them?

00:25.692 --> 00:28.190
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.258 --> 00:30.591
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.658 --> 00:33.056
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.124 --> 00:35.291
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.358 --> 00:37.791
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.859 --> 00:39.463
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.572 --> 00:48.405
<i>For a spy, the first step</i>
<i>after identifying your enemy</i>

00:48.473 --> 00:51.206
<i>and finding</i>
<i>his base of operations</i>

00:51.274 --> 00:53.708
<i>is listening in</i>
<i>on his communications.</i>

00:53.775 --> 00:56.078
<i>This can be as simple</i>
<i>as planting a bug in his phone</i>

00:56.146 --> 00:57.846
<i>or as complex as breaking into</i>

00:57.914 --> 00:59.950
<i>a military-grade</i>
<i>encrypted radio.</i>

01:00.017 --> 01:02.318
<i>Higher security</i>
<i>makes the job harder,</i>

01:02.386 --> 01:04.354
<i>but it comes</i>
<i>with a silver lining --</i>

01:04.421 --> 01:05.921
<i>the tougher the security,</i>

01:05.989 --> 01:08.624
<i>the more valuable the</i>
<i>information it's protecting.</i>

01:08.691 --> 01:10.158
<i>If you can break in,</i>

01:10.226 --> 01:12.159
<i>you can be pretty sure</i>
<i>it's going to be worth it.</i>

01:12.227 --> 01:13.560
Michael, I'm not sure

01:13.628 --> 01:15.795
we're gonna be
able to pull this off.

01:15.862 --> 01:18.697
Anson's using a radio
the NSA itself can't crack.

01:18.764 --> 01:20.632
I don't want to just
give up.

01:20.699 --> 01:22.400
Well,
I'm not giving up.

01:22.467 --> 01:24.901
I'm just pointing out,
there's no way that I can see

01:24.969 --> 01:27.503
to plant a listening device
in his apartment or radio.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.771
We'll have to use the building
across the street --

01:29.839 --> 01:31.205
the security firm.

01:31.273 --> 01:33.507
He's piggybacking
on their communications array.

01:33.575 --> 01:36.078
We get in there, get to
the cell log on the server...

01:36.145 --> 01:37.746
Break into
a defense contractor?

01:37.814 --> 01:40.048
I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

01:40.116 --> 01:42.184
You already destroyed
CIA records.

01:42.252 --> 01:44.621
Just how far are you
willing to go for this?

01:44.689 --> 01:47.157
All the way.

01:54.132 --> 01:57.467
<i>In any secure facility,</i>
<i>the biggest vulnerabilities</i>

01:57.535 --> 02:00.370
<i>tend to be</i>
<i>at the lowest salary levels.</i>

02:00.438 --> 02:02.939
<i>A company that will spend</i>
<i>tens of thousands of dollars</i>

02:03.007 --> 02:04.441
<i>checking out senior staff</i>

02:04.508 --> 02:06.877
<i>will often hire</i>
<i>janitors and window washers</i>

02:06.945 --> 02:09.714
<i>for 9 bucks an hour</i>
<i>after a 20-minute interview.</i>

02:09.781 --> 02:12.050
<i>Getting hired</i>
<i>is usually not too difficult,</i>

02:12.117 --> 02:15.119
<i>and it's even easier</i>
<i>to pay someone a couple grand</i>

02:15.187 --> 02:17.187
<i>to hand over a uniform</i>
<i>and leave town.</i>

02:19.090 --> 02:21.192
All right. This'll do.

02:21.259 --> 02:23.060
The computer's connected
to the server,

02:23.128 --> 02:25.429
and it looks like
no one's in there.

02:25.497 --> 02:27.531
- Stop fiddling. You look fine.
- Please.

02:27.599 --> 02:29.933
A burlap sack
would be an improvement.

02:30.001 --> 02:32.969
You know, for $2,000,
I want a uniform that fits.

02:33.037 --> 02:34.204
Well, the next time
I bribe the guys

02:34.272 --> 02:37.574
at, um, Rise & Shine
Window Washers,

02:37.641 --> 02:38.808
I'll get
an extra-extra-small.

02:40.345 --> 02:44.247
Fi, this charge
looks a little big.

02:44.315 --> 02:45.548
It's supposed to look like
an accident.

02:45.616 --> 02:48.350
You really want to argue
at 300 feet in the air?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.119
You know, a "Thank you"
would be nice, Michael.

02:51.187 --> 02:53.154
All right.
How about this?

02:53.222 --> 02:55.324
Dinner. You and me.
Saturday night.

02:55.391 --> 02:56.491
There you go.

02:56.559 --> 02:59.128
Except we're busy.
Your mom called.

02:59.195 --> 03:01.163
She really wants
another double date with Benny.

03:01.231 --> 03:02.631
I think they're
getting serious.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.300
Do we really have to talk
about that right now?

03:04.368 --> 03:06.035
You can't
avoid it forever.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.503
I can try.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.793 --> 03:33.161
45 seconds. Go.

03:33.229 --> 03:34.996
It's just a simple
records search.

03:35.064 --> 03:36.597
44 seconds
is more than enough.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.604
How about 10 seconds?

03:42.672 --> 03:44.539
Almost done.

03:47.443 --> 03:49.211
Done.

03:56.353 --> 03:58.354
Put your hands up!

03:58.421 --> 04:01.224
Oh, God! Oh, God!
We almost died.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.325
Who are you two?

04:02.393 --> 04:03.393
We work for...

04:03.460 --> 04:04.827
Rise & Shine
Window Washers.

04:04.895 --> 04:07.063
If we weren't clipped in
to those harnesses,

04:07.131 --> 04:08.998
we'd be dead.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.800
I can't
believe we held on that long!

04:12.670 --> 04:14.037
Look, secure the area.

04:14.105 --> 04:16.640
I'm gonna take a statement
from these two.

04:16.707 --> 04:19.543
And again,
please accept my apologies.

04:19.611 --> 04:22.745
I'm just glad
no one was killed.

04:22.813 --> 04:24.981
Does the company have
your phone numbers?

04:25.049 --> 04:26.549
I mean, it's such
an odd incident.

04:26.617 --> 04:28.084
We may want to follow up, make
sure everything's all right.

04:28.152 --> 04:29.286
Don't you think
all the lawyers

04:29.353 --> 04:30.420
will do all the talking
from now on?

04:30.488 --> 04:31.955
Lawyers?

04:32.023 --> 04:34.725
You're not, uh...you're not
thinking of suing us?

04:34.793 --> 04:36.560
Well, I'm actually
<i>thinking</i> about it, yeah.

04:36.628 --> 04:37.962
I mean --

04:38.029 --> 04:39.596
but security guards
aren't normally named

04:39.664 --> 04:41.165
- in lawsuits, are they?
- I don't know.

04:44.502 --> 04:45.969
Hmm.

04:46.037 --> 04:49.839
Well, you two can go.
Get some rest. Feel better.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.576
I am hungry.

04:53.644 --> 04:55.182
Lunch?

04:55.183 --> 04:58.183

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:07.320 --> 05:09.321
So, Anson
was calling here?

05:09.388 --> 05:11.789
- Well, that's odd.
- Why?

05:11.857 --> 05:14.058
Well, most calls around here
are to, uh,

05:14.126 --> 05:16.094
invite widows
to early-bird dinners.

05:16.162 --> 05:18.963
This area's better known
for retirees, not super-spies.

05:19.031 --> 05:22.066
Here we go.
Someone's home.

05:25.971 --> 05:27.338
Oh, my God.

05:27.406 --> 05:28.539
Wait a second.
Is that...

05:28.607 --> 05:29.907
Benny.

05:29.974 --> 05:31.675
As in, your mother's
boyfriend, Benny.

05:34.011 --> 05:36.179
I believe it is.
That son of a bitch!

05:36.247 --> 05:37.647
Hold on, Fi.
Hold on.

05:37.715 --> 05:39.415
Benny could be
working for Anson,

05:39.483 --> 05:41.650
but Anson could just as easily
be spying on Benny.

05:44.087 --> 05:45.890
Either way,
we have to tell Madeline.

05:45.891 --> 05:48.652
No, not yet. Not until we know
exactly what's going on here.

05:49.092 --> 05:50.493
Just...

05:50.560 --> 05:52.996
I have a meeting
with Pearce.

05:53.064 --> 05:55.933
This is gonna take a while.
I need to grab a cab.

05:56.001 --> 05:57.101
Let me guess.

05:57.169 --> 05:58.937
You want me to stay here,
watch Benny,

05:59.004 --> 06:00.438
see what he's up to --
fine.

06:00.506 --> 06:01.773
When the time comes,

06:01.841 --> 06:03.876
your mother's gonna hear
about this from <i>you.</i>

06:15.920 --> 06:19.656
Well, look who's
two minutes early.

06:19.724 --> 06:22.325
I aim to please.
You sounded tense on the phone.

06:22.393 --> 06:23.860
We've got a job
for you.

06:23.928 --> 06:26.362
We intercepted some calls
placed by a weapons engineer,

06:26.430 --> 06:27.630
William Resnik.

06:27.698 --> 06:29.266
He was ordering
high-end guidance chips

06:29.334 --> 06:32.336
to be delivered to a Liberian
chemical company upstate.

06:32.404 --> 06:33.972
Last I checked,
the Liberians

06:34.040 --> 06:35.774
were too busy
shooting each other

06:35.842 --> 06:37.275
to set up
chemical companies.

06:37.343 --> 06:38.610
Last <i>I</i> checked,

06:38.678 --> 06:40.413
chemical companies
don't need guidance chips.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.016
This guy's been off the grid
for a while,

06:43.083 --> 06:45.818
so there's more than a little
concern he's gone rogue.

06:45.886 --> 06:47.320
Let me guess.

06:47.388 --> 06:50.957
You think the best option
is sending in the burned spy.

06:51.024 --> 06:53.258
Actually, no.
It's a Liberian company.

06:53.326 --> 06:56.162
You spent a lot of time
in that part of the world.

06:56.229 --> 06:58.431
There's too big of a risk that
someone will know your face.

06:58.498 --> 07:01.401
The Agency wants you to run
the op with Sam and Jesse,

07:01.468 --> 07:03.302
send <i>them</i> into
the chemical plant

07:03.370 --> 07:06.405
to figure out who Resnik's
working for and what he's doing.

07:06.473 --> 07:09.742
Sam has powerful detractors
at the CIA.

07:09.809 --> 07:12.578
He could stand
to mend some fences.

07:12.646 --> 07:16.015
And it wouldn't hurt you to look
like a team player, either.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.884
You know me --
team player all the way.

07:31.098 --> 07:33.733
So, Mike, that
was one hell of a drive.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.134
What are we
looking at?

07:35.202 --> 07:36.803
It's a chemical-research
facility,

07:36.870 --> 07:38.037
closed two years ago.

07:38.105 --> 07:39.839
Half-dozen guys
with A.K.s.

07:39.906 --> 07:41.307
Not something you
expect to see out here.

07:41.374 --> 07:43.509
It's a lot of activity
for a closed shop.

07:43.577 --> 07:46.378
Lights came back on a month ago.
Liberian company leased it.

07:46.446 --> 07:48.514
Trucks have been dropping off
guidance equipment

07:48.582 --> 07:49.982
and long-range-missile
components

07:50.050 --> 07:51.383
for the last few days.

07:51.451 --> 07:53.052
- According to who?
- Pearce?

07:53.120 --> 07:55.287
The Agency thinks
a weapons engineer,

07:55.355 --> 07:56.855
William Resnik,
went rogue.

07:56.923 --> 07:58.790
It certainly sounds like he's
building a missile in there.

07:58.858 --> 08:00.892
So what? Pearce wants you
to go in and see what's up?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.961
Not me. You guys.

08:03.028 --> 08:05.430
There's a good chance
the target knows my face.

08:05.498 --> 08:07.832
Okay. You kind of
buried the lead there, Mike.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.402
You know, the last time
I did a favor for the CIA,

08:10.469 --> 08:12.004
there were a few...
Hiccups.

08:12.072 --> 08:14.306
I know, Sam, but we're all
on the same team this time.

08:14.374 --> 08:15.541
Resnik made a purchase

08:15.609 --> 08:17.110
from a black-market
chip manufacturer.

08:17.177 --> 08:18.478
The CIA squeezed them.

08:18.545 --> 08:20.580
You guys are gonna get
swapped in as the tech guys.

08:20.648 --> 08:23.717
Pearce put together our cover
before she asked if we would do it?

08:23.785 --> 08:25.753
She was counting on you guys
saying yes.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.554
Not loving
how this went down, Mike,

08:27.622 --> 08:30.124
but I'm not gonna pass up
a chance to bag a traitor.

08:30.191 --> 08:32.659
Yeah, someone's got to
babysit Sam. I'm in.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.461
Thanks.

08:34.529 --> 08:38.265
<i>One of the few businesses</i>
<i>that still make house calls</i>

08:38.332 --> 08:40.701
<i>is black-market</i>
<i>technology vendors.</i>

08:40.768 --> 08:42.135
Get out of the car now.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.970
<i>When someone's paying</i>
<i>a lot of cash</i>

08:44.038 --> 08:46.306
<i>for illegal</i>
<i>weapons-systems components,</i>

08:46.373 --> 08:48.175
<i>they expect full service.</i>

08:48.242 --> 08:50.044
<i>And when your customer</i>
<i>will settle any issues</i>

08:50.112 --> 08:51.345
<i>with a bullet to the head,</i>

08:51.413 --> 08:52.780
<i>it's a good idea</i>
<i>to show up in person.</i>

08:52.848 --> 08:54.782
Brought the materials
you ordered.

08:54.850 --> 08:57.685
You can go. The balance will be
wired into your account.

08:57.753 --> 09:00.823
Don't -- sir. Please. This is
delicate high-end product.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.059
Now, I can't guarantee
performance

09:03.126 --> 09:05.595
unless my tech and I
oversee the install.

09:05.662 --> 09:07.329
Don't worry.
We got an expert inside.

09:07.397 --> 09:09.999
Question -- what sort of seating
is your expert using?

09:11.235 --> 09:13.636
Seating. As in,
what the chip sits in.

09:13.704 --> 09:15.638
I got the
48-hexa-bit X-95s.

09:15.706 --> 09:17.774
If he's expecting the 128s,
he may as well toss the chip,

09:17.842 --> 09:19.676
jam in a piece of salami,
and hope for the best.

09:19.744 --> 09:21.078
Okay. Seriously.

09:24.115 --> 09:26.049
- Hands up.
- Hands what?

09:26.117 --> 09:27.851
Hands up!
Hands up. Okay.

09:27.919 --> 09:29.386
Oh, hey. Hello.

09:29.454 --> 09:31.622
Hey. Nothing there.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.057
Follow me.

09:57.216 --> 09:59.617
Go on inside.
Lab's in there.

10:11.998 --> 10:15.934
Uh, you see how those guards
are keeping an eye on that guy?

10:16.002 --> 10:17.936
Jesse, I don't think we're
dealing with a rogue scientist.

10:18.004 --> 10:19.437
I think we're dealing
with a hostage.

10:22.441 --> 10:23.709
Okay. I guess extraction's
out of the question.

10:23.776 --> 10:25.077
We're just a tad bit
out-muscled.

10:25.144 --> 10:26.478
Yeah, but we can't just

10:26.546 --> 10:28.447
drop these chips off
and leave the poor bastard.

10:28.515 --> 10:29.915
We got to get ourselves
invited back in.

10:29.983 --> 10:31.350
How the hell
do we do that?

10:31.417 --> 10:33.185
I got an idea.

10:35.789 --> 10:37.656
Hey. I got
your guidance chips.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.725
What happened
to Arnie?

10:39.793 --> 10:43.195
Arnie's working a job
up in Boca. We're your guys.

10:43.263 --> 10:44.697
Okay. Let's see
what we got going here.

10:44.765 --> 10:47.266
Put that down! Don't touch that!

10:47.334 --> 10:48.935
Hey. Knuckleheads.

10:49.002 --> 10:50.736
We know you're building
a missile, okay?

10:50.804 --> 10:53.406
I didn't bring guidance chips
for a Cuisinart.

10:53.474 --> 10:54.474
It's like I told
your buddy outside --

10:54.542 --> 10:56.275
I got to check
the seating here,

10:56.343 --> 10:58.545
but I can't do it
through a tarp.

10:58.612 --> 10:59.712
Easy.

10:59.780 --> 11:00.880
Hey, buddy, pal,
I need to see

11:00.948 --> 11:02.749
the, uh, power supply
you're working with.

11:02.817 --> 11:05.385
Oh, yeah. It's just in the back,
over here.

11:05.453 --> 11:07.821
We're with the CIA.
We're here to help.

11:07.889 --> 11:09.723
We don't have a lot of time.
Tell me what's going on.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.091
- No, no.
- You have to leave.

11:11.159 --> 11:13.361
Hey, listen to me. You
want to survive, you will talk.

11:13.428 --> 11:14.695
You're not gonna get
another chance.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.205
Don't worry
about the guards.

11:23.273 --> 11:25.507
They're busy watching
my friend over there.

11:25.575 --> 11:27.108
His name is Joseph Kamba.

11:27.176 --> 11:29.977
He's a lunatic. He's, like,
some sort of warlord.

11:30.045 --> 11:32.913
He's having me build a missile.
It's a nasty one.

11:32.981 --> 11:34.781
Listen -- I can't escape.

11:34.849 --> 11:38.351
He has my daughter,
and I don't know where she is.

11:38.419 --> 11:40.286
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.088
Oh, Jesus.

11:42.156 --> 11:43.789
All right, we'll deal with that.
We'll deal with that.

11:43.857 --> 11:44.957
First we got to
convince these guys

11:45.025 --> 11:46.092
to let us back in here
after we leave,

11:46.160 --> 11:47.060
and we cannot
do that alone.

11:48.863 --> 11:51.932
You need to play along, okay?
Can you do that?

11:51.999 --> 11:53.166
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.670
Damn it. I knew it.

11:56.738 --> 11:58.940
I knew it.
We don't have the right specs.

11:59.007 --> 12:01.943
Is there a problem?

12:02.011 --> 12:03.612
Perhaps I can be
of assistance.

12:06.449 --> 12:07.949
Yes, sir.
There is a problem.

12:08.017 --> 12:09.518
The housings
in your missile

12:09.585 --> 12:11.386
don't fit the chips
that we brought.

12:11.453 --> 12:13.821
Well...
That is unfortunate.

12:15.757 --> 12:17.725
Care to offer
an explanation?

12:17.792 --> 12:21.194
Well,
it's not like, uh...

12:21.262 --> 12:23.963
All this stuff comes from --
from Radioshack, you know.

12:24.031 --> 12:25.465
T-the suppliers we're using,

12:25.532 --> 12:27.200
t-they change the housings
and components all the time.

12:27.268 --> 12:30.237
I never know when it's gonna
happen. Nobody -- nobody knows.

12:30.305 --> 12:31.606
I thought I made it clear

12:31.673 --> 12:33.541
there were to be no mistakes,
Mr. Resnik.

12:35.077 --> 12:38.914
Perhaps a reminder
is in order.

12:38.981 --> 12:41.917
Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
It's an easy fix.

12:41.985 --> 12:43.219
We can get you
the right chips tomorrow.

12:43.286 --> 12:44.687
We've got a batch
of L-21s coming in.

12:44.755 --> 12:45.888
One quick mod,
it'll fit your platform.

12:45.956 --> 12:47.690
This is --
this is no one's fault.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.358
Okay? You didn't
need to do that.

12:49.426 --> 12:51.326
I'll tell you
what I <i>need.</i>

12:51.394 --> 12:55.363
I need the guidance chips
I paid for, and I need them now.

12:55.431 --> 12:57.332
Look, no one's telling you
not to be upset.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.733
You should be upset.

12:58.801 --> 13:01.302
But the thing is, look,
if we don't get this right,

13:01.370 --> 13:02.803
you might as well
<i>throw</i> the missile,

13:02.871 --> 13:05.672
'cause it's gonna be
a lot more accurate.

13:05.740 --> 13:08.275
Very well.

13:08.343 --> 13:10.444
We will make
a new arrangement.

13:10.512 --> 13:14.215
You bring my chips here
tomorrow, and we trade.

13:14.283 --> 13:17.585
My chips...
for your friend.

13:17.653 --> 13:21.156
What? No. No way.
That's not how I do business.

13:21.224 --> 13:22.692
Oh?

13:22.759 --> 13:24.293
It is <i>exactly</i>
how <i>I</i> do business.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.754
Having Jesse in there is bad.
Very bad.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.659
This Kamba guy's
a first-class monster,

13:42.660 --> 13:44.394
even by sub-saharan African
standards.

13:44.462 --> 13:45.695
Yeah, I know.
I read the file.

13:45.763 --> 13:47.330
That's why I've got to
get back in there right now.

13:47.398 --> 13:48.431
Sam, slow down.

13:48.498 --> 13:49.865
If we try
to break Jesse out

13:49.933 --> 13:51.867
before we get Resnik's girl,
she's dead.

13:51.935 --> 13:53.068
I don't disagree.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.736
But we can't leave Jesse
in there forever

13:54.804 --> 13:56.438
while we're hunting
this Resnik girl down.

13:56.505 --> 13:57.672
She could be anywhere.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.073
Uh, actually,
I think we have a lead.

13:59.141 --> 14:00.942
The company that leased
the chemical plant

14:01.010 --> 14:03.278
also rented an estate
over in Cutler Bay.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.146
Fine. I'll check out
Cutler Bay.

14:05.213 --> 14:07.515
Sam, you get ready
to pull Jesse and Resnik out.

14:07.582 --> 14:08.817
And one other thing --
the CIA wants

14:08.884 --> 14:10.085
the specs
for Resnik's missile.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.853
Is that a joke?

14:11.921 --> 14:13.656
This is a new missile design.
Those specs are considered --

14:13.723 --> 14:16.291
don't you dare say
"mission critical," lady.

14:16.359 --> 14:18.794
Jesse and Resnik
are top priority.

14:18.862 --> 14:20.829
I want him
out of there, too.

14:20.897 --> 14:22.364
Look, Mike,
getting him out of there

14:22.432 --> 14:23.766
is gonna be
easier said than done.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.134
That psycho's got
about a dozen guys

14:25.202 --> 14:27.003
strolling around
with AK-47s.

14:27.070 --> 14:30.172
Then we need to figure out a way
to get our guns past the guards.

14:34.778 --> 14:36.879
<i>Spies are</i>
<i>surprisingly good recyclers.</i>

14:36.947 --> 14:38.981
<i>The ability to repurpose items</i>
<i>in the field</i>

14:39.049 --> 14:41.918
<i>can often mean the difference</i>
<i>between life and death.</i>

14:41.985 --> 14:45.121
<i>A broken eyepiece</i>
<i>from a microscope</i>

14:45.189 --> 14:47.857
<i>can make the perfect disguise</i>
<i>for a rifle sight.</i>

14:47.925 --> 14:49.859
<i>And a computer</i>
<i>with a fried motherboard</i>

14:49.927 --> 14:53.262
<i>can house the magazine</i>
<i>of an M-4 rifle.</i>

14:54.097 --> 14:57.800
<i>It's not exactly separating</i>
<i>your bottles and cans,</i>

14:57.868 --> 15:00.503
<i>but it'll keep trash</i>
<i>out of the landfill</i>

15:00.570 --> 15:02.905
<i>and possibly</i>
<i>keep you out of the morgue.</i>

15:13.851 --> 15:15.218
What's up, Fi?

15:15.285 --> 15:17.386
It's Benny.
And it's not good.

15:17.454 --> 15:19.455
I've tailed him
for a couple of hours,

15:19.522 --> 15:21.490
and he's definitely
acting suspicious,

15:21.557 --> 15:23.625
showing signs
that he's been trained.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.060
And I've got the pictures
to prove it.

15:26.128 --> 15:28.429
Okay. I'll go talk to my mom.
But Fi --

15:28.497 --> 15:30.431
let me guess.
Another favor.

15:30.499 --> 15:33.733
Not for me. For the CIA.
A girl's been kidnapped.

15:33.801 --> 15:35.268
Pearce thinks
they tracked her down.

15:35.336 --> 15:37.470
I'm gonna text you the address.
See if she's in there.

15:37.538 --> 15:39.672
So I'm just watching,
not kicking down any doors?

15:39.740 --> 15:41.374
No door-kicking.

15:41.442 --> 15:44.677
Fine. But, Michael,
go talk to your mom.

15:44.745 --> 15:46.145
Right now.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.452
Whatever you're here for,
Michael, it can wait.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.987
Benny's on his way over.

15:54.055 --> 15:55.990
He's gonna take me
to the movies.

15:56.057 --> 16:00.428
Actually, mom...
It's about Benny.

16:01.897 --> 16:03.999
About Benny?
What's wrong?

16:04.066 --> 16:07.202
The man who's
blackmailing me, Anson...

16:07.269 --> 16:10.272
He's using Benny
to spy on you...

16:10.339 --> 16:11.272
and us.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.407
What?!

16:12.475 --> 16:15.510
Michael,
don't be ridiculous.

16:15.578 --> 16:19.381
I'm not being ridiculous.
It's true, mother.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.483
We traced a phone call.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.352
You're serious.

16:25.756 --> 16:27.690
No way.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.659
Benny isn't like that.

16:29.726 --> 16:31.260
He's not a spy.

16:31.328 --> 16:33.062
You're right, mom.
He's not.

16:33.130 --> 16:35.131
He's not
a trained operative.

16:35.199 --> 16:37.734
But Anson is teaching him
some tricks --

16:37.802 --> 16:39.937
how to spot a tail,

16:40.004 --> 16:43.340
not parking
in the same space twice...

16:43.408 --> 16:44.541
Um...

16:44.609 --> 16:46.009
No. See, I, uh...

16:46.077 --> 16:48.845
I told Benny a lot of those
crazy things that you had me do.

16:48.913 --> 16:51.147
That's probably
why he's acting like this.

16:51.215 --> 16:54.084
Mom, he's acting like an asset
who's being run by a spy.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.387
I have to bug his place
this afternoon,

16:58.455 --> 16:59.989
so keep him
at the movies.

17:00.057 --> 17:00.957
Just act normal.

17:03.393 --> 17:05.027
You make it sound
so easy.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.429
It is, Ma.

17:06.496 --> 17:07.896
It's easy for you.

17:09.532 --> 17:11.401
Ever occur to you
maybe you're wrong?

17:11.468 --> 17:13.536
I'm not wrong.

17:16.974 --> 17:20.411
I know this hurts you, but
you have to trust me on this.

17:23.082 --> 17:24.648
No.

17:24.717 --> 17:26.184
Not on this one.

17:26.252 --> 17:30.088
I'll find out the truth
my own way.

17:31.357 --> 17:33.257
And if you're right...

17:33.325 --> 17:35.092
I'll plant the bug
myself.

17:37.695 --> 17:40.596
But if you're wrong...

17:40.664 --> 17:43.900
Hi.
Hey! Benny, hi!

17:43.967 --> 17:45.501
Oh, they're beautiful.

17:45.569 --> 17:47.136
For a beautiful woman.

17:47.204 --> 17:48.805
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.873 --> 17:50.307
Hello, Michael.

17:50.374 --> 17:52.142
Good to see you, Benny.
How you doing?

17:52.210 --> 17:53.744
Hey, listen.
You want to join us?

17:53.812 --> 17:55.612
I'm not normally a fan
of romantic movies,

17:55.680 --> 17:57.681
but I promised your mom
that I would take her.

17:57.749 --> 17:59.416
Thanks for the invite,
but I have to go...

17:59.484 --> 18:00.651
Do something.

18:00.719 --> 18:03.922
Oh. That sounds mysterious.
What is it?

18:03.989 --> 18:05.457
It's me, always working.

18:05.524 --> 18:07.558
Okay.

18:07.626 --> 18:08.726
Have fun, you two.

18:08.794 --> 18:09.860
You about ready?

18:09.928 --> 18:11.895
Yeah, I just have to
put these in water.

18:11.963 --> 18:12.996
Okay.

18:20.205 --> 18:22.606
Ooh, a thermal imaging
camera. Very nice.

18:22.674 --> 18:24.641
Michael, it's not
my birthday for months.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.943
Cute. Pearce
hooked us up with them.

18:27.011 --> 18:28.879
I have to give them back.

18:28.946 --> 18:30.947
Any sign
of Resnik's daughter?

18:31.015 --> 18:32.816
No. I've been here for hours.
Nobody's come in or out.

18:32.884 --> 18:34.451
The far-right window
is covered, though.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.253
I'm guessing that's
where they're keeping her.

18:36.321 --> 18:38.555
One way to find out
for sure.

18:38.623 --> 18:42.325
It's a little hard to tell,
but I'd say we're looking at...

18:42.393 --> 18:44.996
Five heat signatures inside,
all static.

18:45.063 --> 18:47.765
One seated in the far-right room
on the second floor.

18:47.833 --> 18:51.736
Well, I'll go
kick the hornets' nest.

19:11.057 --> 19:13.825
Hello.

19:13.893 --> 19:16.528
I'm Joyce,
your new neighbor.

19:17.964 --> 19:19.798
I baked you
some brownies.

19:19.866 --> 19:21.500
There you go.

19:22.969 --> 19:26.572
Bon appétit.

19:28.241 --> 19:30.209
Either those boys are having
a linebacker slumber party

19:30.277 --> 19:31.410
or they're
guarding someone.

19:31.478 --> 19:32.378
Four moved
the moment you rang the bell.

19:32.446 --> 19:34.781
One stayed still,

19:34.849 --> 19:36.616
tucked in the upstairs room,
away from the window.

19:36.684 --> 19:38.018
My guess, that's Sophie.

19:38.086 --> 19:39.620
You sure we just can't
go in there and grab her?

19:39.688 --> 19:40.955
Fi, they got Jesse.

19:41.023 --> 19:43.591
We pull her out now,
they'll know something's wrong.

19:43.659 --> 19:45.593
Jesse could get killed.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.061
I'm gonna let Sam know

19:47.129 --> 19:49.597
it's time to get back
into the shark tank.

19:56.270 --> 19:57.904
<i>Whether you're smuggling</i>

19:57.971 --> 20:00.640
<i>drugs to sell</i>
<i>or weapons to save a friend,</i>

20:00.707 --> 20:03.008
<i>you can't just</i>
<i>hide contraband and pray.</i>

20:03.076 --> 20:06.244
<i>You have to be able to talk</i>
<i>your way through an inspection.</i>

20:06.312 --> 20:07.913
Okay, just like
I promised.

20:07.981 --> 20:09.915
Fresh batch of L-21s
with adapters.

20:09.983 --> 20:11.884
All set to go.

20:11.952 --> 20:13.786
<i>The key is to keep cool</i>
<i>and keep talking.</i>

20:13.854 --> 20:15.454
<i>The more</i>
<i>they're listening to you,</i>

20:15.521 --> 20:17.990
<i>the less they're looking at</i>
<i>whatever it is you're carrying.</i>

20:18.058 --> 20:20.993
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
we got a missile to build

20:21.061 --> 20:22.861
and, you know, testing these
chips is gonna take a while,

20:22.929 --> 20:24.530
so if you could just
open the gate,

20:24.598 --> 20:26.398
I can drive up
and unload everything.

20:26.466 --> 20:28.400
I have a rule.
No one drives in.

20:28.467 --> 20:31.169
No vehicles
on the property.

20:31.237 --> 20:33.104
Hey, you know.

20:33.172 --> 20:35.039
I'm all for reducing
carbon emissions,

20:35.107 --> 20:36.841
but you got to see
what I got back here.

20:39.311 --> 20:41.478
I mean, that is a lot
of equipment to lug around,

20:41.546 --> 20:42.546
so if we can just, uh...

20:42.614 --> 20:44.181
I'm afraid not.

20:44.248 --> 20:47.084
It may seem strange to you,
but in my country,

20:47.151 --> 20:49.287
a truck is just
a weapon on wheels.

20:49.354 --> 20:51.723
You want something,
you carry it in.

20:51.791 --> 20:53.859
Sir, let's
be reasonable here.

20:53.927 --> 20:55.661
Reasonable.

20:55.729 --> 20:57.963
Another thing
about my country.

20:58.031 --> 20:59.765
Reasonable men die.

20:59.833 --> 21:03.069
The ones who survive
are cautious men...

21:03.137 --> 21:04.504
Like me.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.607
What is all this?

21:07.674 --> 21:10.076
Oh, microscopes,
lenses, processors.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.544
You know, I mean,
what am I gonna do --

21:11.612 --> 21:12.445
kill you
with a microscope?

21:16.716 --> 21:19.384
Bring some men
to carry the equipment.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.618
Yeah, boss.

21:23.356 --> 21:26.090
Yeah, listen --
I hate to be a broken record,

21:26.158 --> 21:29.896
but are you sure
about this no-car policy?

21:29.963 --> 21:31.197
I mean,
we're just gonna have to

21:31.265 --> 21:32.632
haul all this stuff
back out when we're done.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.268
He said no.
Okay, fine. Whatever.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.903
Can you give us a minute?
We got work to do.

21:44.879 --> 21:46.480
How you guys doing?

21:46.548 --> 21:47.648
Oh, it's not
the nicest place

21:47.716 --> 21:48.816
I've ever stayed,
but we're fine.

21:48.883 --> 21:50.250
Just please,
please tell me

21:50.318 --> 21:51.452
you got some big-ass,
bad-ass guns in those cases.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.755
At most,
I got half an M-4.

21:53.822 --> 21:55.757
The rest is in the truck
outside the gate.

21:55.825 --> 21:57.893
This is a disaster.
You said you were gonna help.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.795
I can't delay
the missile anymore.

21:59.862 --> 22:00.962
You know,
he's getting impatient.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.698
I understand that,
but right now

22:02.765 --> 22:04.433
the focus
is getting you out of here.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.602
Yeah? How? With what?
You don't have any guns.

22:06.669 --> 22:09.272
You think Joseph's gonna let you
back in here a third time?

22:09.339 --> 22:14.077
That's why you need to give him
a reason to let us stay here.

22:14.145 --> 22:16.346
Why in the world
would he do that?

22:18.016 --> 22:19.584
If you were injured,
we'd have to.

22:19.651 --> 22:22.286
I'm sorry. What?
What he's saying is,

22:22.354 --> 22:24.355
if you couldn't do the work yourself,
you would need us to stay.

22:24.423 --> 22:25.957
Therefore, he would
need us to stay,

22:26.025 --> 22:28.125
if he wants the job
finished.

22:29.728 --> 22:32.062
If you just burn your hand
or something, you know?

22:32.130 --> 22:34.064
Just bad enough
to sideline you.

22:34.131 --> 22:37.633
If we get pushed out those
doors, you are on your own.

22:37.701 --> 22:39.402
You really want to bet
your daughter's life

22:39.469 --> 22:40.736
on Joseph
just letting you go

22:40.804 --> 22:42.371
after you hand him
the missile?

22:43.873 --> 22:45.407
You can do this.

23:06.264 --> 23:09.433
What do you mean
the burner malfunctioned?!

23:09.501 --> 23:10.667
Is this some kind of game
you're playing at?

23:10.735 --> 23:11.969
Is that what this is?

23:12.036 --> 23:13.570
A game? Look at his hand.
It was an accident.

23:13.638 --> 23:15.773
Just calm down.

23:15.841 --> 23:18.343
Do not tell me
to calm down!

23:18.410 --> 23:19.711
I'm just saying
there's a solution.

23:19.778 --> 23:22.414
I'm thinking the solution here
is three graves.

23:22.481 --> 23:23.949
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just listen, okay?

23:24.016 --> 23:25.016
Listen.
You want your missile.

23:25.084 --> 23:26.184
You want your missile,
right?

23:26.252 --> 23:27.886
We know the equipment
in that lab.

23:27.954 --> 23:29.988
He doesn't need his hands.
We'll be his hands.

23:30.056 --> 23:31.289
You're looking at the best
chip guy in the business.

23:31.357 --> 23:33.458
And I know a thing or two
about missile assembly.

23:33.526 --> 23:36.060
Please.

23:38.964 --> 23:41.164
Please.
We can do this.

23:41.232 --> 23:44.001
All right, then.

23:44.068 --> 23:47.271
I let them be your hands.

23:47.339 --> 23:49.374
And you guarantee
no more delays.

23:49.441 --> 23:50.942
We have a deal?

23:51.010 --> 23:53.645
Absolutely.
We have a deal.

23:53.713 --> 23:55.481
Fine. We shake on it.

24:05.393 --> 24:07.293
I suggest
you get to work.

24:15.335 --> 24:16.869
Okay, Mike.
Here's the deal.

24:17.221 --> 24:18.407
We couldn't
get the guns in.

24:18.408 --> 24:19.996
And without the guns,
we can't make a move,

24:19.997 --> 24:22.232
so we're in a tight spot
here, no joke.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.633
There might be
another way,

24:23.701 --> 24:25.502
but it's gonna take
some doing on your part.

24:25.569 --> 24:26.803
I'm all ears, brother.

24:26.871 --> 24:28.505
The north side of the plant,
near the tanker --

24:28.572 --> 24:31.741
I'm gonna bury two M-4s
20 feet from the fence.

24:31.809 --> 24:33.609
You just figure a way
to get there.

24:33.677 --> 24:35.712
I'm on it.
Thanks, Mike.

24:35.780 --> 24:39.249
Okay. We're all set here.
Co2 levels have been adjusted.

24:39.317 --> 24:42.186
Looks like we're gonna
get the guns after all.

24:42.253 --> 24:46.090
But we're gonna have to convince
Joseph to move the fence first.

24:46.158 --> 24:47.992
What? Why?

24:48.060 --> 24:49.594
Because that's where
the guns are gonna be.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.696
Okay, that's crazy.

24:51.764 --> 24:53.632
No, no, no. That can work.
That can work.

24:53.699 --> 24:55.567
We tweak the electronics
on the missile,

24:55.635 --> 24:57.202
blame it
on the electric fence.

24:57.270 --> 25:01.239
Okay. All right.
Let's do it. Let's do it.

25:04.177 --> 25:05.944
It should be me
in there, fi.

25:06.012 --> 25:08.680
Yeah, well, it isn't.
You're doing everything you can.

25:08.747 --> 25:10.314
The rest, I'm afraid,
is on them.

25:16.455 --> 25:18.056
Nice.

25:18.124 --> 25:19.558
You could walk
right over these

25:19.626 --> 25:21.360
and not even know
they're there.

25:21.427 --> 25:22.895
<i>There is a fine art</i>

25:22.962 --> 25:25.464
<i>to making an electrical</i>
<i>malfunction look spectacular</i>

25:25.531 --> 25:27.599
<i>and yet not do any real damage,</i>

25:27.667 --> 25:30.602
<i>especially when you're</i>
<i>dealing with a deadly missile.</i>

25:30.670 --> 25:31.737
Just up to the I-O bridge,
right?

25:31.805 --> 25:34.039
I got it. Yeah.

25:34.107 --> 25:36.742
Okay, now. Be careful.

25:36.810 --> 25:38.978
I'm just saying --
you're touching the warhead

25:39.045 --> 25:40.179
to the guidance chips now.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.413
So, one mistake
and it's lights-out.

25:41.481 --> 25:42.914
You know, I'm actually
already on top of that.

25:42.982 --> 25:44.749
Okay.

25:44.817 --> 25:47.653
<i>The trick is to overload</i>
<i>a non-explosive component,</i>

25:47.720 --> 25:49.121
<i>like the motherboard.</i>

25:49.188 --> 25:51.724
<i>Replacing resistors</i>
<i>with plain copper wire</i>

25:51.792 --> 25:54.760
<i>will amplify the current,</i>
<i>overload the circuit,</i>

25:54.828 --> 25:56.229
<i>and result in some impressive</i>

25:56.297 --> 25:59.466
<i>but relatively harmless</i>
<i>fireworks.</i>

25:59.533 --> 26:00.800
Okay, are we ready?

26:00.868 --> 26:02.435
We'll know for sure
in a minute.

26:02.503 --> 26:04.804
All right. Tell your boss
it's testing time.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.707
They're ready.

26:09.043 --> 26:10.777
Okay. Here we go.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.115
Okay. Show me progress.

26:15.183 --> 26:17.651
Well, the guidance chips
are state-of-the-art,

26:17.719 --> 26:19.686
with special environmental
modification software

26:19.754 --> 26:21.155
to make sure --

26:21.222 --> 26:23.557
All I care about is whether
or not I have a working missile

26:23.625 --> 26:25.926
that will reach Monrovia
from the Sierra Leone border.

26:25.994 --> 26:29.063
I'll let the target worry
about how it works.

26:29.131 --> 26:32.300
All right. Guys,
turn on the guidance system.

26:34.203 --> 26:36.371
Whoa! Whoa.

26:36.439 --> 26:38.173
What is happening?!
What is this?!

26:38.240 --> 26:39.173
Must be
an electrical problem.

26:39.241 --> 26:40.541
Oh,
the circuits are fried.

26:40.609 --> 26:41.842
We're getting some sort
of interference. I don't know.

26:41.910 --> 26:44.444
I said no more delays!
Yeah, we heard you!

26:44.512 --> 26:45.846
We heard you. What?
You think we're crazy?!

26:45.913 --> 26:47.380
You think we want to get shot?!
Come on! Please.

26:47.448 --> 26:49.015
Just, we'll go outside,
we'll run some tests,

26:49.083 --> 26:50.250
we'll figure out
what's going on.

26:51.786 --> 26:53.286
All right.

26:53.354 --> 26:54.421
You...

26:54.488 --> 26:55.622
And you.

26:55.690 --> 26:56.956
Let's go.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.996
Yeah. No, it's definitely
the electrified fence.

27:03.064 --> 27:05.500
- Is it? How convenient.
- What?

27:05.567 --> 27:08.002
Y-yeah, t-the -- the fence
is too close to the building,

27:08.070 --> 27:09.805
so it's, um --
it's causing a power surge.

27:09.872 --> 27:11.640
It fried a capacitor already.
It'll do it again.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.742
Y-you want your missile?

27:14.810 --> 27:17.011
You're gonna have to
take down the fence.

27:17.079 --> 27:19.480
You think
I am a child?

27:19.548 --> 27:21.049
Do you think
I will tear down this fence

27:21.116 --> 27:22.484
because of your lies?!

27:22.551 --> 27:25.053
Okay. Listen. Listen.
Okay. How about this?

27:25.121 --> 27:26.421
How about this?
Just <i>move</i> the fence.

27:26.488 --> 27:27.655
Just move it back
past the tree line.

27:27.723 --> 27:29.223
That'll solve the problem.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.492
You keep your fence,
you get your missile,

27:31.560 --> 27:32.626
we go home,
everybody wins.

27:42.338 --> 27:44.973
Fine.
We'll move it.

27:48.879 --> 27:50.813
<i>There's nothing quite like</i>

27:50.881 --> 27:53.082
<i>searching the home</i>
<i>of someone you care about</i>

27:53.150 --> 27:54.784
<i>for evidence</i>
<i>they've betrayed you.</i>

27:54.851 --> 27:57.119
<i>It's something spies</i>
<i>have to do regularly,</i>

27:57.187 --> 27:59.021
<i>even with the people</i>
<i>they love the most.</i>

28:01.992 --> 28:05.828
<i>It's never easy searching for</i>
<i>something as hard as you can</i>

28:05.896 --> 28:08.431
<i>and praying</i>
<i>you find nothing at all.</i>

28:44.201 --> 28:46.002
- Maddy.
- Hey.

28:46.069 --> 28:47.637
What are you doing here?

28:47.705 --> 28:50.873
What do you think
I'm doing here? Surprising you.

28:50.941 --> 28:52.875
Well...

28:52.943 --> 28:54.210
How'd you get in?

28:54.278 --> 28:55.345
Benny...

28:55.413 --> 28:56.780
I mean, come on.

28:56.848 --> 28:58.482
I've stayed over
a few times.

28:58.550 --> 29:00.250
That fake rock of yours
doesn't fool anybody.

29:00.318 --> 29:02.019
Well, why wouldn't you just --

29:02.087 --> 29:04.022
Why wouldn't I just
make dinner for my boyfriend?

29:04.089 --> 29:05.923
Salmon. Your favorite.

29:07.860 --> 29:10.862
And for dessert,
pecan pie.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.697
Pecan pie?

29:12.765 --> 29:14.299
Ooh.

29:14.367 --> 29:15.734
You know me too well,
Mad.

29:15.802 --> 29:18.336
Better every day, Benny.

29:19.705 --> 29:21.139
Oh.
I left wine in the car.

29:21.207 --> 29:23.976
And, uh -- would you get it?
And I'll set the table.

29:24.043 --> 29:26.262
Okay. You're gonna have
to remind me to leave

29:26.263 --> 29:27.212
the house more often.

29:27.213 --> 29:28.380
Oh.

29:30.316 --> 29:31.983
Okay?

29:32.051 --> 29:32.984
Mm-hmm.

29:33.052 --> 29:33.952
All right.

30:01.615 --> 30:04.417
That back door is all glass.

30:04.484 --> 30:06.352
If you punch in hard,
you should be able

30:06.420 --> 30:09.055
to get the attention of all
the guards on the first floor.

30:09.123 --> 30:11.425
I'll be fine, Michael.
Just get up the stairs fast.

30:11.492 --> 30:12.826
Get Sophie out of there.

30:13.927 --> 30:15.362
Let me check
their position.

30:15.429 --> 30:18.431
We'll move as soon
as we hear from Sam.

30:21.902 --> 30:23.002
Fi, we got a problem.

30:28.574 --> 30:30.975
They're not in there.

30:35.348 --> 30:37.349
So, they moved the fence.
Now what?

30:37.417 --> 30:38.784
I'm gonna run the gauge
along it,

30:38.852 --> 30:40.453
and when I get to the guns,
I'm gonna need a distraction.

30:40.521 --> 30:41.821
Well, these guys
seem pretty tense.

30:41.889 --> 30:43.723
Shouldn't be too hard
to get their attention.

30:43.791 --> 30:45.224
I'm gonna take out
the guys near me,

30:45.292 --> 30:47.828
and I'll get the guns before
they know what's happening.

30:47.895 --> 30:49.963
Oh, wait. Check it out.

30:50.031 --> 30:52.400
I thought Joseph
wasn't letting any vehicles in.

30:54.470 --> 30:56.404
He wasn't.
Something's up.

30:59.642 --> 31:01.843
Sir, we need to check
the fence.

31:01.911 --> 31:03.645
That can wait.
I want to show you something.

31:08.584 --> 31:10.218
Sophie. Sophie!

31:10.285 --> 31:11.586
Did they hurt you?

31:11.654 --> 31:13.855
No. Daddy,
I just want to go home.

31:15.224 --> 31:17.192
What the hell
is she doing here?

31:17.260 --> 31:20.096
Well, in my experience,
a father always works harder

31:20.163 --> 31:22.398
when he knows he's working
for his family.

31:22.466 --> 31:25.268
Tell me something.

31:25.335 --> 31:27.304
Do you love
your daughter?

31:27.371 --> 31:29.339
Do you
want to keep her safe?

31:32.710 --> 31:36.680
Please.
She's just a child, okay?

31:36.747 --> 31:39.649
- Please.
- Do your job.

31:39.717 --> 31:42.752
No more delays
and excuses.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.755
Show me...

31:48.624 --> 31:54.229
...What a father will do
to keep his daughter safe.

31:54.297 --> 31:55.264
Hmm?

31:58.802 --> 32:02.605
You have two hours.
Get them inside.

32:12.241 --> 32:14.441
There's nothing else I can do.
I don't have a choice, okay.

32:14.443 --> 32:15.844
I need to just
finish it for him.

32:15.912 --> 32:17.346
Look, I can't
presume to know

32:17.413 --> 32:19.214
what you're going through
as a father,

32:19.282 --> 32:22.184
but handing a completed missile
over to Joseph is a bad idea.

32:22.252 --> 32:23.953
I'm done
listening to you.

32:24.021 --> 32:26.289
He has my daughter.
I have to finish.

32:26.357 --> 32:28.091
Okay. What's gonna happen then,
huh? Think about it.

32:30.561 --> 32:31.995
Seriously, man,
he's not gonna spring you

32:32.063 --> 32:33.430
just so you can go
tell the world what he did.

32:33.497 --> 32:36.031
Best case, we all
get to go to Liberia

32:36.099 --> 32:38.234
and make more missiles
for him.

32:38.302 --> 32:39.702
What's the worst case?

32:39.770 --> 32:43.139
He decides he only needs
one missile, and he kills us.

32:43.207 --> 32:45.442
Okay. What the hell
do you propose?

32:45.509 --> 32:48.845
I'm working on it.
Keep busy and stay cool.

32:48.913 --> 32:51.314
All right.
Who cut this tail fin?!

32:51.381 --> 32:55.351
It's 3/8 of an inch too wide!
Come on, guys!

33:05.227 --> 33:06.895
Sam, listen.
We don't have much time.

33:06.962 --> 33:09.364
They moved Sophie.

33:09.432 --> 33:11.266
Chances are,
they brought her to the plant.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.601
Fi and Pearce are scouting
the perimeter now.

33:13.669 --> 33:14.844
Well, they can stop looking,
'cause Kamba's got her.

33:15.937 --> 33:17.138
So she's still alive?

33:17.205 --> 33:18.706
Yeah, for now.
But Mike, look.

33:18.773 --> 33:19.907
Joseph's
in a killing mood.

33:19.975 --> 33:21.275
He's paranoid
about the delays,

33:21.343 --> 33:23.210
and he brought the girl in
to motivate Resnik.

33:23.278 --> 33:25.079
Sam, listen.
There <i>might</i> be a way out.

33:25.147 --> 33:26.714
Do you think
you can convince him

33:26.782 --> 33:28.149
the delays
aren't an accident --

33:28.217 --> 33:30.151
that one of his own men
has betrayed him?

33:30.219 --> 33:31.453
Like a sabotage play?

33:31.521 --> 33:33.789
Kind of a divide-and-conquer
type thing?

33:33.856 --> 33:35.257
I can tell the story,
Mike,

33:35.325 --> 33:37.226
but I don't think
I can back it up from here.

33:37.294 --> 33:39.162
Remember Ukraine, '97.

33:39.229 --> 33:41.598
You think
that could work here?

33:41.665 --> 33:43.333
Yeah.
Is 10 minutes enough time?

33:43.400 --> 33:46.936
I guess it'll have to be.
Okay. Thanks, brother.

33:48.739 --> 33:50.740
What's going on?
We got a plan?

33:50.808 --> 33:54.043
Yeah. 10 minutes from now,
don't be near any gas pipes.

33:54.111 --> 33:56.478
Mike's gonna put on a little
show for our friend Kamba.

33:56.546 --> 33:57.880
I'm gonna go
meet with him now.

33:57.947 --> 33:59.915
Okay.
What can we do?

33:59.982 --> 34:01.149
Is this thing
about ready?

34:01.217 --> 34:02.751
Well, we have to solder
a few more leads.

34:02.819 --> 34:05.687
Good. Arm it.
Make sure it's ready to blow.

34:05.755 --> 34:10.192
You -- guard guy.
I got to talk to your boss now.

34:10.260 --> 34:12.696
<i>An electrified fence</i>
<i>can't protect</i>

34:12.764 --> 34:15.933
<i>against someone</i>
<i>who has no need to breach it.</i>

34:16.001 --> 34:17.501
<i>When you have</i>
<i>a network of gas pipes</i>

34:17.569 --> 34:19.136
<i>that run across</i>
<i>property lines,</i>

34:19.204 --> 34:22.539
<i>a well-placed block of C-4</i>
<i>on a gas main outside the fence</i>

34:22.607 --> 34:24.741
<i>can cause</i>
<i>an explosive chain reaction</i>

34:24.809 --> 34:27.244
<i>inside whatever compound</i>
<i>that fence is protecting.</i>

34:33.351 --> 34:35.786
Was I unclear
in my instructions?

34:35.853 --> 34:38.188
No, sir.
You were perfectly clear.

34:38.255 --> 34:40.324
We, um...

34:40.391 --> 34:42.292
We need to talk alone.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.795
Oh, do we?

34:44.862 --> 34:47.630
Sir, I know that I'm
risking my life coming here,

34:47.699 --> 34:49.400
but I have no reason
to lie.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.268
I just need
a moment of your time.

34:53.206 --> 34:55.873
Out. Everybody, now.

35:01.915 --> 35:04.116
Sir, we got to talk
about these delays.

35:04.184 --> 35:07.452
Now, I know it's something
that you might not want to hear,

35:07.520 --> 35:10.789
but somebody is working against
us, someone on the inside.

35:10.857 --> 35:13.992
From the inside?
You mean one of my men?

35:14.059 --> 35:15.359
Yes, sir.

35:15.427 --> 35:17.495
I don't know who or why,
but it's the only explanation,

35:17.563 --> 35:19.163
'cause your men
are the only ones with access.

35:21.066 --> 35:23.368
Tell me something.

35:23.435 --> 35:28.874
Why would one of my men
board a boat in Liberia,

35:28.941 --> 35:31.076
cross an ocean,
help me build this place,

35:31.144 --> 35:32.144
and then betray me?

35:32.211 --> 35:33.345
I don't know, sir.

35:33.413 --> 35:35.514
I'm just saying,
things are going wrong,

35:35.581 --> 35:37.248
and I don't think
it's all accidents.

35:37.316 --> 35:38.750
One of your men is --

35:38.818 --> 35:41.452
You worry about the missile.
I'll worry about my men.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.756
There is no sabotage here,
just incompetence!

35:47.926 --> 35:49.226
Sir, what's going on?!

35:49.294 --> 35:51.329
The gas lines!
Somebody blew the gas lines!

35:53.265 --> 35:54.565
Sir, you've
got to believe me.

35:54.633 --> 35:57.001
Whoever's behind this
is making their move right now.

35:57.069 --> 35:58.169
How do I know
it wasn't you?

35:58.237 --> 36:00.905
Me?! How the hell
could it be me?

36:00.973 --> 36:02.139
- I'm stuck in the lab.
- Aah!

36:07.312 --> 36:09.413
So it's just coincidence
that all this happened

36:09.480 --> 36:11.248
when you and your friend
arrived here?

36:11.316 --> 36:13.417
My friend and I
are here to do a job for money.

36:13.484 --> 36:15.285
It doesn't get done,
we don't get paid,

36:15.353 --> 36:16.753
'cause we don't work
for free.

36:16.821 --> 36:19.690
So maybe...

36:19.757 --> 36:22.325
It's Resnik.

36:22.393 --> 36:25.461
Sir, please, the last thing
you want to do right now

36:25.529 --> 36:27.263
is kill the only reason
why that guy

36:27.331 --> 36:29.298
is still building a missile
for you.

36:29.366 --> 36:32.334
So please, sir, let's just
try and salvage this situation.

36:32.402 --> 36:36.371
But we need to go now,
before the cops get here.

36:36.439 --> 36:37.905
Fine.

36:37.973 --> 36:40.508
We'll take her.

36:54.757 --> 36:57.026
Why are you
still standing there?

36:57.093 --> 36:58.327
Go put out
that fire now.

36:58.395 --> 36:59.461
But you said --

36:59.529 --> 37:01.163
and now I am saying go.
Now, go!

37:02.799 --> 37:07.570
So, do you have a plan
to get the missile out?

37:07.637 --> 37:08.838
Sir, the missile
weighs 900 pounds.

37:08.905 --> 37:10.172
There's no way
we're getting it out of here.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.374
What?

37:11.441 --> 37:13.175
You don't need this missile.
You got us.

37:13.243 --> 37:14.544
We'll build you
a new one.

37:14.611 --> 37:17.146
It's true. I can get you a lab,
anything you want.

37:17.214 --> 37:19.082
Don't hurt Sophie, and I'll
do whatever you want me to do.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.883
So what happens to that?

37:20.951 --> 37:22.185
That's the beautiful part.

37:22.252 --> 37:23.686
We arm the warhead to blow
and leave it behind

37:23.753 --> 37:26.322
for whatever son of a bitch
was behind this whole fiasco.

37:26.389 --> 37:28.958
That way you'll kill the rat
and you get rid of the evidence

37:29.026 --> 37:30.993
all in one move.

37:31.061 --> 37:33.529
Fine.

37:33.597 --> 37:34.497
Do it!

37:36.800 --> 37:38.700
Now, sir,
when this is done,

37:38.768 --> 37:40.035
we're gonna have to
stay away from your guards,

37:40.103 --> 37:41.403
'cause at this point,

37:41.470 --> 37:43.438
we don't know who's with you
and who's against you.

37:43.506 --> 37:44.874
We can shut the power down

37:44.941 --> 37:47.810
and sneak through the section
of the fence you just moved,

37:47.877 --> 37:49.244
but we
got to do it now.

37:49.312 --> 37:51.647
Okay. We got two minutes,
and this thing's gonna blow.

37:51.715 --> 37:54.851
If any of you try to escape,
I shoot you all.

37:54.919 --> 37:56.353
Now, go!

38:12.137 --> 38:14.138
What's happening?
What are you doing?

38:14.206 --> 38:16.607
Never mind. Go back to the lab.
To the missile.

38:16.675 --> 38:20.345
Go! All of you!

38:20.413 --> 38:23.051
Now move faster!
Or I shoot her in the leg!

38:23.052 --> 38:23.967
All right. All right.

38:23.992 --> 38:25.460
He's watching us too closely
to get the guns.

38:26.118 --> 38:28.185
I thought you said that thing was
gonna blow in two minutes, man.

38:28.253 --> 38:30.554
I set it for two minutes.
I don't know what's happening.

38:30.622 --> 38:32.089
There must be something wrong.
I don't know what it is.

38:45.034 --> 38:48.737
Now you see how I deal
with my enemies.

38:48.805 --> 38:50.239
Oh, yeah?

38:51.108 --> 38:51.974
Drop it.

38:55.378 --> 38:57.713
That's how we deal
with <i>our</i> enemies.

39:11.095 --> 39:14.465
Well, I just got off
a very unpleasant phone call

39:14.532 --> 39:15.967
with my superiors.

39:16.034 --> 39:18.336
They wanted
those weapon specs.

39:18.404 --> 39:20.338
Come on, Pearce.
That was a pretty nasty missile.

39:20.406 --> 39:22.106
I think it's best for everybody
that it's gone.

39:22.174 --> 39:23.741
Yeah, about that.

39:23.808 --> 39:25.242
They have a hard time
believing

39:25.310 --> 39:27.244
that Joseph Kamba
blew up his own missile.

39:27.312 --> 39:29.813
Well, that's the thing
about crazy warlords.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.981
Never know what kind of crazy
idea's just gonna

39:32.049 --> 39:33.783
...pop into their
pop into their

39:33.850 --> 39:34.984
crazy, little warlord head.
Crazy, little warlord head.

39:35.052 --> 39:35.818
Yeah.

39:35.886 --> 39:37.119
Heh.

39:37.187 --> 39:38.487
The job got done,
but neither of you

39:38.555 --> 39:39.822
made a lot of friends
with this one.

39:39.889 --> 39:41.323
Giving the CIA
half of what they wanted

39:41.391 --> 39:42.190
is the Sam Axe
specialty.

39:50.067 --> 39:51.267
What's gonna happen
to Resnik

39:51.335 --> 39:52.535
now that Kamba's
been taken down?

39:52.603 --> 39:54.470
I convinced the brass
to unofficially

39:54.538 --> 39:56.907
help get him and his daughter
out of the country.

39:56.975 --> 39:59.877
I'll say this much
for you, Westen.

39:59.944 --> 40:01.712
You know
how to run an op.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.848
What op?
We were never here.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.077
<i>It's always difficult</i>

40:15.145 --> 40:17.780
<i>eavesdropping</i>
<i>on someone you know well</i>

40:17.848 --> 40:20.016
<i>or, worse,</i>
<i>someone you care about.</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:21.751
<i>The closer you are to them,</i>

40:21.819 --> 40:25.188
<i>the worse it feels to listen in</i>
<i>on their private moments.</i>

40:25.256 --> 40:27.357
<i>Harder still</i>
<i>is spying on someone you love</i>

40:27.424 --> 40:29.927
<i>who's blatantly betraying you.</i>

40:29.994 --> 40:31.895
Ma,
you don't have to do this.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.865
I'm fine sitting here
by myself.

40:34.933 --> 40:35.899
Okay.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.868
I don't care
how long it takes.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.770
I planted that bug. I want
to hear what he has to say.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.443
I want to know
if it was all a lie.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.912
It's never <i>all</i> a lie.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.281
It's always more complicated
than that.

40:53.683 --> 40:56.819
I thought
he had feelings for me.

40:56.886 --> 40:59.388
Honestly,
he probably did.

40:59.456 --> 41:01.090
<i>Hello.</i>

41:01.158 --> 41:02.993
<i>You haven't</i>
<i>returned my calls.</i>

41:03.060 --> 41:05.229
That must be Anson
on the other end.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.598
I've done everything
you've asked of me.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.133
When will it be enough?

41:09.201 --> 41:10.401
When I say it is.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.104
<i>You did take my money,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

41:12.172 --> 41:13.105
<i>Yes.</i>

41:13.173 --> 41:15.408
I took your money.

41:15.475 --> 41:17.443
And I feel terrible.

41:17.511 --> 41:19.078
<i>I'd give it all back</i>
<i>if I could.</i>

41:19.146 --> 41:20.613
<i>I hurt this woman.</i>

41:20.681 --> 41:22.949
<i>And I think she's</i>
<i>starting to suspect something.</i>

41:23.016 --> 41:24.650
<i>Now is not</i>
<i>the time to panic.</i>

41:24.718 --> 41:26.720
Do you understand?
I understand.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.121
