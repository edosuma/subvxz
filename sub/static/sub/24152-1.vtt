04:01.405 --> 04:02.607
Hello?

04:09.812 --> 04:10.881
Are you all right, miss?

04:12.482 --> 04:14.547
What can I do for you?

04:14.549 --> 04:16.483
Well, first I want
a licorice lace,

04:16.486 --> 04:18.485
'cause I haven't seen
any in about ten years

04:18.487 --> 04:19.954
and I used to love
them as a kid.

04:21.589 --> 04:24.158
And I'm looking for my friend.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.460
She moved here about
nine months ago.

04:26.462 --> 04:28.365
Do you recognize her?

04:34.936 --> 04:36.538
Oh...

04:41.175 --> 04:42.875
No, sorry, I'm just kidding.

04:42.877 --> 04:44.710
Yeah...

04:44.712 --> 04:46.712
This is the girl that moved
into the lighthouse.

04:46.714 --> 04:49.681
She comes in here
from time to time.

04:49.683 --> 04:52.986
She's not quite
this girl anymore.

04:52.988 --> 04:56.492
Well, how do I get
to this lighthouse?

06:56.305 --> 06:57.942
Oh, hi.

06:59.175 --> 07:00.710
It's Maya, right?

07:03.011 --> 07:04.179
It's Amy.

07:06.015 --> 07:07.617
You've grown.

07:13.989 --> 07:16.893
Well, it looks like you've finally
learned how to cook then.

07:19.028 --> 07:21.795
It's a nice place, isn't it?

07:21.797 --> 07:23.632
Very distant.

07:27.135 --> 07:28.267
Maya's grown.

07:28.269 --> 07:29.635
What do you want?

07:29.637 --> 07:31.169
You Beth, Jesus.

07:31.171 --> 07:33.205
I didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.

07:33.207 --> 07:36.708
Had to find out where you were
from Charlie in accounts.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.311
How's he doing?

07:38.313 --> 07:40.179
Oh great, yeah,
he's getting a new puppy.

07:40.181 --> 07:41.647
What kind?

07:41.649 --> 07:42.851
I don't know.

07:44.719 --> 07:45.887
What are you doing?

07:47.853 --> 07:50.088
God, you're like
a five year old.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.322
Why are you here?

07:51.324 --> 07:54.058
I just wanna talk to you,
Beth.

07:54.060 --> 07:57.062
Just one night
and then I'll go.

07:57.064 --> 08:00.701
We can't leave things
how we... left them.

08:03.136 --> 08:06.773
Anyway, took me
ages to get here.

08:08.374 --> 08:11.809
And it looks like you need
a little bit of a hand.

08:11.811 --> 08:15.015
You're really good at making
it look like I have a choice.

08:16.849 --> 08:17.948
It's what I'm best at.

08:29.128 --> 08:31.027
That's what I meant.

08:31.029 --> 08:33.900
In about two minutes your road
home will be underwater.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.157
Thanks for helping me
with my bag, by the way.

09:03.159 --> 09:05.128
You brought it.

09:14.204 --> 09:18.073
Well, if you've lost your mind out here at
least you've still got your taste in music.

09:18.075 --> 09:20.612
Need something
to fill the void.

09:21.744 --> 09:23.047
Not now, Maya.

09:27.083 --> 09:30.050
Maya, go.

09:30.052 --> 09:32.221
What do you want?
Jesus, Maya!

09:49.438 --> 09:51.374
Go on.

09:55.444 --> 09:58.046
She still not talking?

10:01.315 --> 10:03.118
We try not to talk about it.

10:23.103 --> 10:24.970
Oh, you've got a dog?

10:24.972 --> 10:26.404
Had.

10:26.406 --> 10:28.142
Oh, sorry.

10:39.184 --> 10:40.453
What kind of dog was she?

10:45.057 --> 10:47.791
It's a bit dark in here,
should we open the curtain?

10:47.793 --> 10:50.297
Don't. We like it shut.

10:53.332 --> 10:55.235
Okay, that's a bit weird.

11:50.886 --> 11:52.989
I think I see things
all the time.

11:55.158 --> 11:57.461
Probably just driftwood,
or a whale.

11:59.963 --> 12:03.501
Lighthouses are more about people
looking this way than us looking out.

12:05.068 --> 12:07.501
Very educational.

12:07.503 --> 12:10.205
In a past life I used to tell
people about things.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.109
How has the advertising game
survived without you?

12:15.611 --> 12:17.243
Has it?

12:17.245 --> 12:19.783
I left people
like you in charge.

12:20.915 --> 12:22.318
It's still around.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.086
I actually left the company
a couple of months ago.

12:27.088 --> 12:31.358
I didn't wanna keep walking past your old
office and making small talk with people.

12:31.360 --> 12:36.898
No one said anything but I wasn't
very popular after you left.

12:39.399 --> 12:40.869
How's Maya?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.536
She's in her room.

12:44.538 --> 12:46.906
She's amazing, you know.

12:46.908 --> 12:50.012
You can always tell that she's thinking,
there's a lot going on in there.

12:53.081 --> 12:55.183
Look, I don't really
know what I'm doing.

12:56.417 --> 12:59.520
No, it seems like it.

13:02.055 --> 13:03.554
I'm sorry, I should
have said something.

13:03.556 --> 13:04.959
Yeah, you should.

13:07.160 --> 13:12.030
Christ, I wasn't gonna hang around to
explain to everyone how it gets...

13:12.032 --> 13:13.597
how it gets better
every day...

13:13.599 --> 13:15.570
So you just moved out here
to the arse end of nowhere?

13:17.271 --> 13:19.169
It's definitely
a change of pace.

13:19.171 --> 13:21.308
You could say that again.

13:23.075 --> 13:24.610
Quiet at least.

13:26.244 --> 13:27.546
No gossip.

13:33.218 --> 13:35.285
So that's it?

13:35.287 --> 13:37.354
Just you and Maya?

13:37.356 --> 13:39.092
How long?

13:43.262 --> 13:45.464
You're not coming back,
are you?

13:47.464 --> 13:49.965
You left, didn't you?

13:49.967 --> 13:52.969
Yeah, I don't mean
back like that, I mean...

13:52.971 --> 13:57.610
You know, people, schools.

13:59.644 --> 14:01.213
How is Maya's schooling?

14:02.613 --> 14:04.580
I'm homeschooling her.

14:04.582 --> 14:09.018
What? Beth, come on, Maya needs
to be around kids her own age.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.453
She needs help, professionals,

14:11.455 --> 14:13.387
specialists,
people who know stuff.

14:13.389 --> 14:14.958
I know stuff.

14:16.693 --> 14:19.027
We tried, okay? It didn't work.

14:19.029 --> 14:20.597
So you stopped trying.

14:24.567 --> 14:26.504
I'm sorry.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.405
It's getting late.

14:30.407 --> 14:32.577
I should go and
make the sofa up.

14:38.246 --> 14:40.316
We can chat in the morning.

14:46.321 --> 14:48.392
Thanks for letting me stay.

18:21.595 --> 18:25.296
So, erosion.

18:25.298 --> 18:29.401
Hey, Maya. Maya?
Paying attention?

18:29.403 --> 18:30.770
Good.

18:32.806 --> 18:36.306
So you see these cliffs
way back here?

18:36.308 --> 18:41.844
They used to be all the way out
there over thousands of years ago.

18:41.846 --> 18:46.850
Before the lighthouse.
Before us. Before anything.

18:46.852 --> 18:48.755
Maya.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.756
You see the way
the waves hit them?

18:53.758 --> 19:00.463
Every time they hit, they break off
teeny, tiny pieces that we can't even see

19:00.465 --> 19:04.934
and the cliffs become
smaller and smaller

19:04.936 --> 19:09.238
as the waves knock
them off more and more.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.707
Amy?

19:10.709 --> 19:14.744
So what happens to
the teeny tiny pieces?

19:14.746 --> 19:16.979
Good question.

19:16.981 --> 19:20.850
So the little pieces become
sediment at the bottom of the sea

19:20.852 --> 19:25.756
and sometimes they wash up onto
the coast and they form beaches.

19:27.557 --> 19:31.592
Basically erosion is when
something big breaks down

19:31.594 --> 19:36.598
little by little
and ends up somewhere else

19:36.600 --> 19:40.869
and Amy if you're going to turn
that into a Freudian metaphor

19:40.871 --> 19:43.537
I swear to God
I am going to slap you.

19:43.539 --> 19:45.375
You said it.

19:47.276 --> 19:50.410
When are you going to start
teaching Maya something else?

19:50.412 --> 19:52.812
I mean, come on, erosion?

19:52.814 --> 19:56.783
What about... snow?
Shakespeare?

19:56.785 --> 19:58.586
Anything?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.888
I thought this would
be something nice.

20:00.890 --> 20:06.560
No, you thought this was gonna make you
like you knew what you were doing.

20:06.562 --> 20:07.930
Okay, grab that.

20:11.933 --> 20:14.800
So, you know what this is?

20:14.802 --> 20:17.870
This used to be
somebody's house,

20:17.872 --> 20:22.075
a crustacean that
lived in this rock pool.

20:22.077 --> 20:26.445
Do you like rock pools?
So do I. I love rock pools.

20:26.447 --> 20:29.014
I used to play in them all the
time. They were so much fun.

20:33.588 --> 20:36.855
- Get inside.
- What, why?

20:36.857 --> 20:39.657
Don't ask, just go.
Maya, let's go.

20:39.659 --> 20:42.461
What, Beth?

20:42.463 --> 20:44.266
Now.

21:36.915 --> 21:41.585
I had a weird childhood too. You
won't tell your mum, will you?

21:41.587 --> 21:42.989
Thanks.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.850
Christian?

22:48.683 --> 22:50.854
You're living in his house?

23:21.015 --> 23:23.184
Hey, Maya.

23:33.759 --> 23:35.929
Oh, cool. I used to be
really good at drawing.

23:39.065 --> 23:42.700
Okay, bit too soon.
That's fine.

23:42.702 --> 23:45.172
Just show me when
you're ready, yeah.

23:51.209 --> 23:54.180
Does that kind of thing
happen a lot with your mother?

23:56.849 --> 24:00.518
It's weird 'cause...

24:00.520 --> 24:04.788
when I met your mum it was at
this marketing conference thing

24:04.790 --> 24:09.260
which is basically a room full of boring people
talking about boring things for a living.

24:09.262 --> 24:13.128
But your mum got up on stage
because she was doing a talk

24:13.130 --> 24:19.002
and the whole room felt silent 'cause
she just had this energy about her

24:19.004 --> 24:24.240
and she made you feel like she was
taking to each person individually

24:24.242 --> 24:27.676
and she was up there
talking to us about

24:27.678 --> 24:32.014
the secret of,
I don't know, whatever.

24:32.016 --> 24:35.250
And halfway through I realized
that I was laughing.

24:35.252 --> 24:38.119
And I was the only
one laughing,

24:38.121 --> 24:43.625
I looked around the room and everyone was looking
at me like I was some sort of crazy person

24:43.627 --> 24:47.695
but Beth just carried on.

24:47.697 --> 24:52.570
It was like she was trying to
make me laugh but just for me.

24:55.673 --> 24:58.772
By the end of it, obviously,
she'd got everyone around

24:58.774 --> 25:02.710
and everyone was standing up
on their feet and cheering.

25:02.712 --> 25:06.713
I was at the back so
I popped out to the loo and,

25:06.715 --> 25:11.618
when I walked in she was
in there but had her back to me.

25:11.620 --> 25:15.956
And I realized that she was
just throwing her guts up,

25:15.958 --> 25:20.530
over the toilet,
just vomiting.

25:26.300 --> 25:29.739
Sorry, that was probably a really
weird story to tell you wasn't it?

25:32.139 --> 25:35.874
Look, what I'm saying is

25:35.876 --> 25:42.248
your mom is so clever and...

25:42.250 --> 25:49.121
and so controlled or she likes to
think she's in control all the time.

25:49.123 --> 25:54.325
She likes to believe
she's in control.

25:54.327 --> 25:59.667
I think at the moment
she's having a...

26:02.769 --> 26:05.738
a bit of a tricky time.

26:05.740 --> 26:12.009
I just need your help
to look after her.

26:12.011 --> 26:17.317
Do you think you
can do that? Thanks.

27:12.804 --> 27:14.640
Beth!

29:06.546 --> 29:08.782
Amy.

29:11.349 --> 29:14.285
Where've you been?

29:14.287 --> 29:16.155
What were you doing
by the cliff edge?

29:19.024 --> 29:20.490
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

29:20.492 --> 29:23.358
Yes.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.097
Then what were you doing?!

29:28.266 --> 29:30.135
Why were you following me?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.909
Crab pots.

29:40.444 --> 29:43.412
Look, this place is...

29:43.414 --> 29:45.483
I think we should leave.

29:47.183 --> 29:49.052
I'm not going anywhere.

29:50.186 --> 29:52.156
You can go if you want.

29:55.025 --> 29:57.162
We can't stay like this.

30:01.865 --> 30:03.835
What are you doing here?

30:04.902 --> 30:07.568
I'm trying to help you.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.206
Why?

30:13.209 --> 30:16.244
Go get cleaned up.

30:16.246 --> 30:20.584
There's no one else here for miles,
except you, me, and my daughter.

31:26.979 --> 31:28.915
Where's Maya?

31:34.353 --> 31:37.254
This is ridiculous. She can't
have gone far, can she?

31:37.256 --> 31:41.426
Cliffs, rocks, you said it yourself,
if when the tide comes in...

31:41.428 --> 31:43.561
Yeah, but she's never
disappeared before, has she?

31:43.563 --> 31:48.331
No. Maya! Maya!

31:48.333 --> 31:50.068
Christ, are you drunk?

31:51.169 --> 31:53.102
Let's just find Maya, okay?

31:53.104 --> 31:55.705
Okay, she hasn't run
off before, though, has she?

31:55.707 --> 31:57.506
What are you getting at?

31:57.508 --> 31:59.141
Well, just that if you're...

31:59.143 --> 32:01.110
How can you have
one eye on her...

32:01.112 --> 32:03.213
I know how to look
after my daughter.

32:03.215 --> 32:05.147
Yes, but after what
happened yesterday...

32:05.149 --> 32:10.219
Maya! The only thing
that's changed is you.

32:10.221 --> 32:12.655
Beth, come on, what are
you not telling me?

32:12.657 --> 32:14.259
Maya!

32:21.165 --> 32:24.032
Why did you come
down here, Maya, why?!

32:24.034 --> 32:26.070
Why?

32:37.646 --> 32:42.954
You can't leave me
like that, Maya. Why?

32:50.027 --> 32:51.262
It's okay.

33:30.131 --> 33:32.401
I think we should
go back and bury it.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.562
Maya. Maya, what's wrong?

34:41.399 --> 34:45.167
Oh my God. It's okay.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.768
It's just a bad dream,
you're going to be okay.

34:46.770 --> 34:48.438
What's wrong? Is she okay?

34:48.440 --> 34:50.609
She's just having a nightmare.

34:55.279 --> 34:56.846
How often does she
wet the bed?

34:56.848 --> 34:59.417
She doesn't.

35:10.293 --> 35:13.729
The good news is we didn't find
anything physically wrong with Maya,

35:13.731 --> 35:19.233
apart from the rather nasty
panic attack and she's calm now.

35:19.235 --> 35:23.837
Due to the severity of the attack,
and your unusual living situation,

35:23.839 --> 35:26.174
I am going to prescribe
some emergency medication

35:26.176 --> 35:28.846
in the event that you
can't get back to us.

35:31.915 --> 35:35.916
Of course, we'll have to wait for the test
to come back to get the complete picture

35:35.918 --> 35:39.286
but as far as we can tell
she's gonna be just fine.

35:39.288 --> 35:42.590
A good night's sleep,
and someone to keep

35:42.592 --> 35:45.692
an eye on her for
a few days should suffice.

35:45.694 --> 35:48.331
You look like that
wouldn't hurt you either.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.966
Maya... doesn't talk.

35:53.968 --> 35:57.704
She hasn't made a sound
since her father died.

35:57.706 --> 36:00.807
She doesn't make a sound when
she laughs or cries either.

36:00.809 --> 36:05.245
I tried everything
to get her to speak.

36:05.247 --> 36:11.483
I've taken her to therapists,
psychologists, hypnotists, nothing.

36:11.485 --> 36:17.556
But last night she screamed at the
top of her lungs, it was deafening.

36:17.558 --> 36:21.226
There's no physical reason
why Maya shouldn't speak

36:21.228 --> 36:25.965
or make any of the noises
on the usual scale.

36:25.967 --> 36:29.668
Sometimes when a child
undergoes trauma at a young age

36:29.670 --> 36:33.471
they can take a little while
feeling comfortable communicating

36:33.473 --> 36:35.272
and I think this is
on that spectrum.

36:35.274 --> 36:37.609
Do you think she'll
start talking now?

36:37.611 --> 36:42.814
Well, there's no overnight cure but,
with patience, most cases catch up.

36:42.816 --> 36:46.017
You should probably inform her
school if they're not already aware.

36:46.019 --> 36:50.921
Children like Maya need a little extra care
and attention to stop them falling behind.

36:50.923 --> 36:56.361
You may want to consider a specialist learning
center if you're willing and able to move.

36:56.363 --> 36:58.731
I'm homeschooling her.

37:00.799 --> 37:06.269
She... doesn't do well
with large groups of people.

37:06.271 --> 37:09.773
Well, she's still very young, and
with the right encouragement,

37:09.775 --> 37:15.581
it may be best for her to endure more
socialization, however daunting.

37:17.750 --> 37:21.617
I'll bring her
through to you now.

37:21.619 --> 37:27.758
Oh, whilst it's not the sound you were hoping
for, it is a start, wouldn't you agree?

37:29.761 --> 37:31.926
I wonder what she's
gonna sound like...

37:31.928 --> 37:34.566
when she starts talking again.

37:36.734 --> 37:39.000
Maybe like you.

37:39.002 --> 37:40.069
Silent.

37:44.408 --> 37:46.407
She had a very pretty voice.

37:46.409 --> 37:51.378
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she used to read out loud all the time.

37:51.380 --> 37:54.749
She had a great vocabulary.

37:54.751 --> 37:57.584
We used to sing together.

37:57.586 --> 37:59.787
I love singing.

37:59.789 --> 38:01.689
I know you do.

38:01.691 --> 38:03.691
You do?

38:03.693 --> 38:06.795
Yeah, I used to hear you humming
from my desk all the time.

38:08.998 --> 38:13.369
That doctor says everything is gonna
be fine. She's gonna be okay.

38:14.437 --> 38:18.471
But you don't think so?

38:18.473 --> 38:20.943
Would you think it was weird
if I stayed to find out?

38:59.645 --> 39:02.947
Don't come in until I tell you.
Maya, stay with Amy.

39:02.949 --> 39:05.319
I'll be back in a moment, okay?

40:53.723 --> 40:55.858
Stay outside.

43:14.724 --> 43:18.094
This is where Christian
grew up, isn't it?

43:19.896 --> 43:21.795
Did you break in here?

43:21.797 --> 43:26.166
What, no,
this was someone else.

43:26.168 --> 43:29.168
Look, what is happening here?

43:29.170 --> 43:31.341
There's no one
in the house now.

43:33.743 --> 43:36.045
I must have...

43:39.982 --> 43:42.116
Let's just forget
about all of this.

43:42.118 --> 43:44.418
This, this, this?
After what he did

43:44.420 --> 43:47.053
and you leave his stuff here
like a fucking museum?

43:47.055 --> 43:50.223
- It is his house!
- No, he's dead!

43:50.225 --> 43:52.859
And good riddance!

43:52.861 --> 43:54.797
Look, are we safe here?

44:00.068 --> 44:04.106
Maya, it's all right, Maya.

44:06.006 --> 44:10.310
There's nothing to be afraid of,
I checked everything.

44:13.012 --> 44:18.786
There's nothing to worry about,
because, there was nothing.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.823
Beth.

45:37.294 --> 45:38.462
Beth.

45:44.468 --> 45:45.969
Maya?

45:53.008 --> 45:56.177
What are you doing
with a knife?

45:56.179 --> 45:58.849
Maya?

46:02.152 --> 46:04.552
Maya.

46:04.554 --> 46:06.155
Give me the knife.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.123
Maya!

46:10.125 --> 46:13.960
Fuck!

46:13.962 --> 46:16.332
Oh God! Maya!

46:20.335 --> 46:21.938
Maya!

46:23.806 --> 46:25.172
Maya!

46:25.174 --> 46:26.442
Maya.

46:31.413 --> 46:33.581
Maya, come back!

46:37.450 --> 46:40.119
Have you seen someone
in the house?

46:40.121 --> 46:43.354
Someone standing over
your bed at night?

46:43.356 --> 46:45.092
I think I've seen him too.

47:41.113 --> 47:42.613
<i>This shit again, really?</i>

47:42.615 --> 47:45.547
I've finished with her.
She knows that.

47:45.549 --> 47:48.884
Didn't even ask you to leave
the fucking company

47:48.886 --> 47:51.887
because I figured you'd do it for
me, for Maya, our little girl?

47:51.889 --> 47:54.956
- Christian, I...
- How many chances is too many, Beth?

47:54.958 --> 47:58.830
How many times is enough? 'Cause
I'm starting to lose count.

48:00.465 --> 48:02.000
I'm sorry, okay?

48:05.002 --> 48:07.371
We'll be fine, I promise.

48:10.908 --> 48:13.176
Just give me one more chance.

48:18.515 --> 48:21.683
I planned a surprise for you.

48:21.685 --> 48:23.554
Wanted us to celebrate.

48:25.656 --> 48:28.290
Is it still worth it?

48:28.292 --> 48:30.624
Of course.

48:30.626 --> 48:34.063
C'mon. Show me the surprise.

48:42.271 --> 48:44.106
This is nice.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.976
Thank you.

48:49.145 --> 48:50.210
I'm sorry.

48:50.212 --> 48:53.213
No, you're not.

48:53.215 --> 48:57.317
I mean it.
Please, Christian, just,

48:57.319 --> 49:02.154
forgive me this one last time and I
promise you this will never happen again.

49:02.156 --> 49:04.656
You make it sound
like I have a choice.

49:04.658 --> 49:06.658
You do.

49:06.660 --> 49:09.696
You've always got a choice
and I'm just so grateful that

49:09.698 --> 49:14.670
you're using that choice
to take me back, for Maya.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.441
I've been thinking about this,
you know.

49:23.242 --> 49:28.079
Did you know that you can
predict 87% of

49:28.081 --> 49:33.452
US presidential elections
just based on height alone?

49:33.454 --> 49:37.521
- It's called the halo effect.
- I know what the halo effect is, Christian. Listen...

49:37.523 --> 49:42.693
No. You can predict 87%

49:42.695 --> 49:49.033
of elections because people always
assume that tall people are capable.

49:49.035 --> 49:52.605
They think pretty
people are kind.

49:54.674 --> 49:58.042
They think being good at something
means you'll be good to other people.

49:58.044 --> 50:03.279
We just see something good and think
more goodness will grow from it.

50:03.281 --> 50:06.150
Like good and bad
are just on a scale

50:06.152 --> 50:12.588
and if you're enough steps along the
rest will just take care of itself.

50:12.590 --> 50:14.691
And that's you, Beth.

50:14.693 --> 50:19.195
People convince themselves
that you're special.

50:19.197 --> 50:23.666
That you're so charming
and intelligent

50:23.668 --> 50:29.204
that you have to be somewhere,
deep down, a good person.

50:29.206 --> 50:33.208
And then we want you
to like us...

50:33.210 --> 50:35.110
but you're not.

50:35.112 --> 50:40.549
You're mean and narcissistic
and controlling

50:40.551 --> 50:42.386
and a drunk.

50:45.755 --> 50:48.757
And it's much worse for Maya.

50:48.759 --> 50:52.661
And you're so blinding
for the rest of us.

50:52.663 --> 50:55.266
But for her,
you're her mother.

50:58.535 --> 51:02.669
People waste their whole lives
wanting their parents to love them

51:02.671 --> 51:07.175
and you've already got two
of us completely lost.

51:07.177 --> 51:11.180
There are probably more.
Don't know, I'm guessing.

51:16.452 --> 51:18.785
There isn't anyone else.

51:18.787 --> 51:21.587
You're so convincing

51:21.589 --> 51:26.592
that she will sacrifice everything
just to be there for you

51:26.594 --> 51:29.695
because she thinks
you're perfect

51:29.697 --> 51:32.532
but you're not.

51:32.534 --> 51:35.434
You just suck people in

51:35.436 --> 51:39.639
and you wouldn't sacrifice shit
for anyone, not even her.

51:39.641 --> 51:43.780
I can't see it.
And I know you.

51:45.613 --> 51:48.379
So what do you want me to do?

51:48.381 --> 51:52.320
Change. But you're not
going to, are you?

51:55.323 --> 51:58.393
And I'll probably keep
falling for it as well.

52:00.327 --> 52:04.398
Now what chance does Maya stand
with parents like us, eh?

52:44.502 --> 52:47.437
You think it's Christian
don't you?

52:47.439 --> 52:50.473
Look, I've seen
some things.

52:50.475 --> 52:54.343
Someone, I don't know. It's always,
out of the corner of my eye but,

52:54.345 --> 52:57.479
I think, I think
Maya's seen it too.

52:57.481 --> 53:03.686
Look, I... went back
and buried that dead dog.

53:03.688 --> 53:06.555
Look, you just,
you just have to tell me.

53:06.557 --> 53:10.358
You have to tell me, otherwise I'm just
gonna take my stuff, and take Maya.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.427
No.

53:11.429 --> 53:13.296
We can't stay here.

53:13.298 --> 53:15.200
Not like this.

53:18.202 --> 53:19.869
If there is something out there,

53:19.871 --> 53:21.806
there is something you
are not telling me about.

53:25.274 --> 53:29.911
Look, what we did was wrong.

53:29.913 --> 53:33.217
And now we're being
punished for it.

53:35.551 --> 53:38.252
Fuck that.

53:38.254 --> 53:41.522
Fuck that and fuck you.

53:41.524 --> 53:44.391
He tried to kill you, Beth.

53:44.393 --> 53:48.394
He pulled you over a cliff
into the ocean and then, what?

53:48.396 --> 53:50.898
You drag your daughter
out here to his house,

53:50.900 --> 53:54.267
which is literally surrounded
by cliffs and the ocean.

53:54.269 --> 53:57.604
Do you understand
how insane that is, Beth?

53:57.606 --> 54:01.474
You are the biggest
risk out here.

54:01.476 --> 54:03.245
What?

54:04.746 --> 54:06.582
Risk to whom?

54:13.955 --> 54:18.023
Okay, maybe there isn't some,
anything like, uh...

54:18.025 --> 54:21.426
Maybe I was wrong about the dog, but
the first thing that needs to happen

54:21.428 --> 54:23.596
is that you need to
get rid of Christian's stuff.

54:23.598 --> 54:25.565
All of it, all gone.

54:25.567 --> 54:28.400
Beth, he is dead.

54:28.402 --> 54:30.705
You are keeping him alive.

54:32.306 --> 54:36.975
So that's it?
You just want me to get...

54:36.977 --> 54:40.979
to destroy everything and then
when Maya asks me about her father

54:40.981 --> 54:44.418
I tell her what? Nothing?

54:48.289 --> 54:49.754
Yes.

54:49.756 --> 54:51.890
Or lie.

54:51.892 --> 54:55.660
That's not a truth
anyone deserves.

54:55.662 --> 54:58.962
Look, you have to
burn it, Beth.

54:58.964 --> 55:00.600
All of it.

55:03.368 --> 55:04.869
I can't.

55:04.871 --> 55:07.637
Yes, you can. You can.

55:07.639 --> 55:11.375
This isn't you,
you're better than this.

55:11.377 --> 55:13.246
You have to.

55:20.386 --> 55:23.622
Please stay? Please?

55:28.526 --> 55:31.830
Fine. I'll do it.

55:32.997 --> 55:35.434
It has to be you.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.271
Fine.

55:42.341 --> 55:43.843
Fine.

55:45.643 --> 55:47.045
You know what? Why wait?

55:56.920 --> 55:58.589
Oh.

57:07.854 --> 57:09.587
I just saw someone come in here.

57:09.589 --> 57:11.123
Beth.

57:11.125 --> 57:14.460
Maya, please just speak to me.

57:14.462 --> 57:15.895
Say something Maya, Please.

57:15.897 --> 57:17.399
Beth. Beth.

57:20.967 --> 57:23.671
Maya, what do you
have behind your back?

57:26.039 --> 57:28.740
Show it to me.

57:28.742 --> 57:30.411
Now!

57:31.778 --> 57:34.382
- Just give it to me.
- Beth!

57:42.856 --> 57:45.922
Where did you get this?

57:45.924 --> 57:48.761
Did you go into the storage?

58:03.542 --> 58:06.612
You said everything, right?

58:37.274 --> 58:40.608
It's scary sometimes isn't it?

58:40.610 --> 58:44.014
My mum used to be my favorite
person in the whole world.

58:47.083 --> 58:52.156
She was a nurse and
she always knew what to do.

58:56.791 --> 59:00.029
<i>And then she got sick herself.</i>

59:02.064 --> 59:05.966
<i>She didn't know
what to do anymore.</i>

59:05.968 --> 59:10.738
<i>And some days
I'd get home from school</i>

59:10.740 --> 59:14.040
and she'd open the door to me

59:14.042 --> 59:19.515
and look at me like I was
some sort of stranger.

59:23.552 --> 59:27.790
Sometimes she'd just...
shut the door in my face,

59:30.824 --> 59:36.061
and, little by little,

59:36.063 --> 59:42.034
<i>I could see the person who I
loved the most in the world</i>

59:42.036 --> 59:43.938
<i>was going away.</i>

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:35.909
No.

01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:25.761
Oh, clever girl. Come on then.

01:02:47.414 --> 01:02:49.116
Beth?

01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:54.422
Beth?

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:02.428
Beth.

01:03:05.163 --> 01:03:08.132
What, what's going on?

01:03:27.051 --> 01:03:30.453
Beth, don't, please,
please just talk to me.

01:03:30.455 --> 01:03:32.854
Tell me you're still there.

01:03:32.856 --> 01:03:34.926
It'll be okay.

01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:04.952
Maya!

01:04:04.954 --> 01:04:07.121
- Baby, I'm so sorry!
- Maya!

01:04:07.123 --> 01:04:10.260
You must believe me,
I would never hurt you!

01:04:39.387 --> 01:04:41.621
Amy.

01:04:41.623 --> 01:04:44.990
Amy, please, it's me,
I'm okay now.

01:04:44.992 --> 01:04:47.929
Christian's gone,
I beat him you see.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:55.403
We can be together again.

01:04:57.104 --> 01:05:03.241
Just like before,
just you and me...

01:05:03.243 --> 01:05:05.145
and Maya.

01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:10.218
We can be a family.

01:05:12.419 --> 01:05:14.386
Isn't that what you want?

01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:24.865
Amy?

01:05:27.467 --> 01:05:29.135
Amy?

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.440
You'll have to
come out eventually.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:50.456
Maya.

01:05:58.263 --> 01:05:59.866
Maya?

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:05.168
Where are you?

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.606
Maya!

01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:29.026
Maya.

01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:33.663
Don't cry, I'm here now.

01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:44.941
Maya.

01:06:49.145 --> 01:06:53.614
Maya, you trust me, don't you?

01:06:53.616 --> 01:06:59.321
It'll be just the two of us
again soon, I promise.

01:07:06.327 --> 01:07:07.562
Beth.

01:07:09.464 --> 01:07:12.165
We're leaving.

01:07:12.167 --> 01:07:15.301
We're not going anywhere.

01:07:15.303 --> 01:07:17.240
This place isn't sick.

01:07:19.108 --> 01:07:21.043
It's you.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:28.114
Maya, come!

01:07:28.116 --> 01:07:30.248
Come.

01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:53.374
I'll kill you before
I let you take her.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:18.761
Maya.

01:08:18.763 --> 01:08:21.600
Come on, Maya,
come on, let's go.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.084
Maya!

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.495
Maya!

01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:33.815
Hi. Good day at school?

01:11:33.817 --> 01:11:36.954
Come on then, chatterbox,
in you get.

01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:52.836
Mom?

01:11:57.352 --> 01:12:02.352
