WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:12.375 --> 00:14.917
HE'S NOT TALKING TO ME.

00:14.959 --> 00:16.166
I'M NOT NOT TALKING.

00:16.208 --> 00:18.417
HE'S BARELY TALKING.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.375
I WAS MARRIED...
LONG TIME AGO.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.041
I TOLD HIM,
BUT HE SEEMS TO THINK

00:24.083 --> 00:27.625
I DIDN'T TELL HIM
SOON ENOUGH.
(clears throat)
WELL, THAT'S...

00:27.667 --> 00:29.834
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
(clears throat)

00:29.875 --> 00:31.875
(elevator bell dings)

00:36.875 --> 00:37.834
HELLO.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.375
HELLO.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.834
HELLO.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.667
(chuckles) OH, I THOUGHT
WE WERE SAYING HELLO.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.625
WE'RE NOT.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.166
KITTEN.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.875
MY NAME IS ADDISON.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.041
I THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE A DRINK.
IT'S 9:00 A.M.

00:53.083 --> 00:56.041
WELL,
I THOUGHT WE COULD TALK.
ARE YOU DYING?

00:56.083 --> 00:59.208
WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE CANCER,
RENAL FAILURE, A BRAIN TUMOR?

00:59.250 --> 01:01.458
ARE YOU YOU DYING?
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.834
WELL, HERE I AM.
YOU SAW ME.

01:04.875 --> 01:06.875
SO NOW YOU'RE LEAVING?

01:08.208 --> 01:09.959
YOU ARE.

01:13.917 --> 01:17.208
I'M AT THE CARLYLE.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.917
COME ON, DR. WILDER.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.917
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.
THE CANCER HAS SPREAD

01:25.959 --> 01:28.041
FROM YOUR ABDOMEN
TO YOUR LIVER TO YOUR LUNGS,

01:28.083 --> 01:29.458
AND YOU'VE KEPT
YOUR OPTIMISM.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.041
MY COLON'S GOOD...

01:31.083 --> 01:33.083
LIKE A TEENAGE VEGETARIAN.
(chuckles)

01:33.125 --> 01:35.500
NEIL?

01:35.542 --> 01:38.208
ALL MY TESTS ARE PERFECT.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.041
THE BABY LOOKS GOOD.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.041
AND DR. MONTGOMERY ASSURES ME
IT'S A GIRL.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.709
SO YOU BETTER REVISE
YOUR LIST OF NAMES.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.709
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A GIRL NAMED DOUG.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.083
BESIDES, DOCTORS ARE WRONG
ALL THE TIME.

01:53.542 --> 01:57.041
ALL RIGHT, PETE, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BLOOD HAS TO TELL YOU.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.709
I NEED SIX WEEKS.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.000
I NEED TO BE THERE.
I NEED TO HOLD OUR LITTLE GIRL.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.041
WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID,
MIND OVER MATTER.

02:05.083 --> 02:09.041
YOUR ATTITUDE IS GREAT. THERE'S
NOTHING MORE I COULD ASK FOR.
WELL, I'M ASKING.

02:09.083 --> 02:12.041
I'M ASKING FOR MORE.
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SAVE HIM,

02:12.083 --> 02:14.041
BUT... I NEED YOU TO TELL ME

02:14.083 --> 02:17.041
HE'S GONNA BE ALIVE
WHEN SHE'S BORN.

02:17.083 --> 02:21.333
I NEED MY LITTLE GIRL
TO HAVE A FATHER.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.041
SHE HAS TAKEN A LOVER.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.333
A LOVAH.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.667
AND HE'S OLD?
GOOD-LOOKIN' OLD.

02:31.709 --> 02:34.041
BUT FROM THE WAY
SHE LOOKED AT HIM,

02:34.083 --> 02:36.041
I'D SAY HE'S NOT
HER LOVER ANYMORE.

02:36.083 --> 02:39.125
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A GUY.

02:43.417 --> 02:46.709
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.000
SO, UH, EVERYBODY HAVE
A GOOD WEEKEND?

02:49.041 --> 02:51.625
WELL, I DID--GOOD WEEKEND.
IT WAS VERY EVENTFUL.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.917
GOT MARRIED.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.917
(laughs)
UH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.959
UH, IT'S--IT'S FAST
AND--AND CRAZY--
WHOA. WHERE'D YOU MEET HER?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.500
I-I DIDN'T. UH...
I MARRIED HEATHER.

03:02.542 --> 03:05.041
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY,
BUT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,

03:05.083 --> 03:07.333
AND--AND SHE'S CLEANED UP,

03:07.375 --> 03:10.041
AND--AND BETSEY'S REALLY HAPPY,
REALLY HAPPY.

03:10.083 --> 03:13.000
SO IT'S GREAT. I HAD
A--I HAD A GREAT WEEKEND.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.041
WHERE IS MY SON?

03:19.083 --> 03:21.792
EVAN DAWSON. I'M HIS MOTHER,
LYNN JARVEY.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.625
I'M SORRY. I DON'T--
MY SON WAS KIDNAPPED.
YOU SAW HIM.

03:24.667 --> 03:32.417
YOU TREATED HIM HERE, AND I
THINK YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.417
(Cooper) UH, YES,
I DID TREAT HIM...

03:34.458 --> 03:36.041
A WHILE AGO,

03:36.083 --> 03:37.417
AND I DON'T--

03:37.458 --> 03:39.417
IT WASN'T EVAN, THOUGH.
IS IT MAYBE PORTER?

03:39.458 --> 03:42.458
HE MAY HAVE TOLD YOU THAT,
BUT THAT IS MY SON.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.000
HIS FATHER KIDNAPPED HIM,
AND I WANT HIM BACK.
WOW. UM, I'M SORRY.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.458
I HIRED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

03:47.500 --> 03:49.458
WHO SAYS YOU TRACED
HIS INSULIN PUMP.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.709
YOU CALLED HIS PEDIATRICIAN
FROM THIS OFFICE.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.458
YOU KNEW HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BEFORE HE WAS HOSPITALIZED.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.458
MRS. JARVEY,
LET ME ASSURE YOU,

03:57.500 --> 04:00.041
I TREATED YOUR SON,
AND THEN HE LEFT.

04:00.083 --> 04:03.041
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A CALL.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.709
YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE
YOUR SON EITHER.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.041
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER,
THIS BOY TOLD ME

04:08.083 --> 04:10.917
HE WAS BEING ABUSED
BY HIS STEPFATHER.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.083
I'M ASSUMING
THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND.
YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU'RE
HELPING MY SON,

04:14.125 --> 04:16.709
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ME
OR MY HUSBAND,

04:16.750 --> 04:19.041
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.041
I AM HIS MOTHER.
I WOULD KNOW.

04:21.083 --> 04:25.041
EVAN IS A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY
WITH SEVERE DIABETES

04:25.083 --> 04:26.625
WHO GOT AN INFECTION

04:26.667 --> 04:28.750
BECAUSE HE WAS LIVING
IN HIS FATHER'S CAR.

04:28.792 --> 04:32.083
(voice breaking) WHO KNOWS
HOW THEY'RE LIVING NOW?

04:32.125 --> 04:34.458
PLEASE, DR. FREEDMAN,
IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.500
I DON'T WANT MY SON
TO DIE.

04:36.542 --> 04:40.000
I WISH I COULD HELP.
I'M SORRY.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.291
(sniffles)

04:46.333 --> 04:49.041
(sighs)

04:49.083 --> 04:52.458
(sighs) DAMN IT.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.041
(Gabriel) PROBLEM?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.750
MY PATIENT IS DYING.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.750
HIS WIFE IS DUE IN SIX WEEKS,
AND HE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.750
INTRA-ABDOMINAL SARCOMA
WITH LIVER AND LUNG METS.

05:01.792 --> 05:04.041
(clicks keyboard keys)
WELL...

05:04.083 --> 05:06.375
HE HAS A FEW WEEKS
AT BEST.

05:06.417 --> 05:09.083
WHAT I THOUGHT.
UNLESS YOU WANT TO TRY
SOMETHING NEW.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.375
WHAT, PRAYER?
(laughs) NO.

05:11.417 --> 05:13.083
BETTER. ME.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.458
OKAY, SACRILEGIOUS, MAYBE.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.458
BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
SOME NEW PROCEDURES

05:16.500 --> 05:18.166
TO INHIBIT TUMOR GROWTH.

05:18.208 --> 05:22.542
MAYBE GIVE YOUR PATIENT
ENOUGH TIME TO MEET HIS BABY.
NEIL DELHOM?

05:22.583 --> 05:25.375
IT'S THAT BAD? I JUST SAW HIM
AND MARGARET IN THE LOBBY.
IT'S THAT BAD.

05:25.417 --> 05:30.208
BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER.
I HAVE READ YOUR PROTOCOLS
ON TUMOR INHIBITORS.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.208
THEY'RE NOT WITHOUT
SIDE EFFECTS.
WHAT KIND OF SIDE EFFECTS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.000
THEY RUN THE GAMUT,

05:35.041 --> 05:37.000
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS,
YOUR PATIENT'S DYING.

05:37.041 --> 05:42.166
I CAN GIVE HIM A BETTER
QUALITY OF LIFE THAN DEATH.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.000
GOING SOMEWHERE?

05:45.041 --> 05:46.166
OUT.

05:46.208 --> 05:48.959
(lowered voice) YOU MAY NOT
WANT TO TALK TO ME,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.166
BUT I REMEMBER EVAN DAWSON
FROM A YEAR AGO

05:51.208 --> 05:53.166
WHEN I COVERED FOR YOU.
AND?

05:53.208 --> 05:56.208
AND IF YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,
TURN THEM IN.

05:56.250 --> 06:00.208
I DON'T AND I HANDLED IT.
I GOTTA GO.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.583
BASICALLY,
I PUT A RADIO TRANSMITTER

06:02.625 --> 06:04.041
INTO YOUR LIVER

06:04.083 --> 06:06.959
AND USE A PROBE
TO HEAT UP THE TUMOR

06:07.000 --> 06:09.125
AND BLAST THE CANCER CELLS.
(Naomi) MARGARET.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.125
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT
TO DIGEST.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.625
(sighs)

06:13.667 --> 06:18.041
WE SPENT TWO YEARS
TRYING TO HAVE THIS BABY--

06:18.083 --> 06:21.458
HORMONES AND NEEDLES
AND DOCTORS TELLING US,

06:21.500 --> 06:23.542
"THAT'S ALL I CAN DO."

06:23.583 --> 06:26.917
(voice breaking)
NOW WE'RE HAVING THE BABY...

06:28.959 --> 06:32.583
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR...

06:32.625 --> 06:36.375
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO NEIL.

06:36.417 --> 06:40.041
THIS...
THIS C--THIS CAN HELP?

06:40.083 --> 06:43.250
ALL OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES
ARE EXCELLENT.

06:43.291 --> 06:46.917
AND YOU'RE RECOMMENDING THIS?

06:46.959 --> 06:49.250
I'M...

06:49.291 --> 06:51.041
I'M CONCERNED.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.709
I-I WANT TO THROW EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN AT THIS,

06:54.750 --> 06:58.041
BUT I ALSO WANT WHATEVER TIME
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE... LIVABLE

06:58.083 --> 07:00.875
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.291
PETE?

07:05.375 --> 07:07.333
WELL, YOU ASKED FOR MORE TIME,

07:07.375 --> 07:09.333
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER
TO HAVE A FATHER.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.917
DR. FIFE...

07:13.125 --> 07:16.125
HE'S YOUR ONLY SHOT.
I SAY TAKE IT.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.333
IT'S COOL.
WE'RE STUDYING ROBOTICS.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.291
WOW. THAT'S BIG-TIME.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.250
UH, THE PUMP LOOKS GOOD.
IT'S CLEAN.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.834
YOU DO HAVE A SLIGHT FEVER,
THOUGH, SO I'M JUST GONNA--

07:30.875 --> 07:33.333
I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BLOOD.
IT MIGHT BE AN INFECTION.
OKAY.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.917
HOW YOU FEELING OTHERWISE?
A LITTLE TIRED,
BUT MOSTLY GOOD.

07:35.959 --> 07:39.000
YOU CAN HAVE A TACO ON ME.
YOU WANT ME TO GET LOST?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.250
KINDA, YEAH.

07:40.291 --> 07:43.291
YOU JUST--
JUST GIVE US A MINUTE, BUD.

07:45.625 --> 07:50.500
(clears throat) SO, UM,
THIS ISN'T JUST A HOUSE CALL.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.041
NO.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.041
UH, LYNN CAME TO SEE ME.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.041
DOES SHE KNOW WE'RE HERE?
DOES SHE KNOW WE'RE IN L.A.?
I DON'T THINK SO,

07:58.083 --> 07:59.583
BUT SHE HIRED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

07:59.625 --> 08:02.333
SHE THINKS I KNOW SOMETHING.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE L.A.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.333
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO HER,
AND I WON'T.

08:04.375 --> 08:08.375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN
ON MY ACCOUNT.

08:08.417 --> 08:12.542
WE'RE SETTLED, YOU KNOW?
WE'RE MAKING A LIFE.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.333
IS SHE STILL WITH TED?
YES.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.166
HOW CAN A WOMAN CHOOSE
A MAN OVER HER OWN SON?

08:21.208 --> 08:25.417
I DON'T... I...

08:25.458 --> 08:28.041
SO JUST BE CAREFUL, FRANK.

08:28.083 --> 08:32.291
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING
COMES BACK ON THESE LABS.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.041
A MARRIAGE INTERVENTION?

08:35.083 --> 08:37.750
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE?
IS THERE EVEN SUCH A THING?

08:37.792 --> 08:39.291
IT'S CODEPENDENCE, PETE.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.291
DELL IS FACILITATING
HER ADDICTION

08:41.333 --> 08:43.333
BY TAKING HER BACK
EVERY TIME SHE GETS CLEAN.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.333
AND THERE'S A CHILD
AT STAKE.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.333
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I MEAN, DELL IS MARRIED.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.333
IS HE HAPPY?
I-I THINK HE'S IN DENIAL.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.417
HE MARRIED THE MOTHER
OF HIS CHILD.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.667
COULDN'T THAT BE A GOOD THING?

08:55.709 --> 08:58.250
OKAY, I HAVE A PATIENT
WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS SOME HELP.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.041
PETE, WILL YOU...

09:01.083 --> 09:03.041
KEEP AN EYE ON DR. FIFE?

09:03.083 --> 09:05.041
HE WORRIES ME.
HE WORRIES ME, TOO,

09:05.083 --> 09:07.417
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.417
SO ARE YOU IN?

09:12.458 --> 09:14.417
(speaks inaudibly)
(Violet and Naomi
speak indistinctly)

09:14.458 --> 09:17.041
OH, THERE HE IS. HEY, HEY.
WHERE WERE YOU?
HI.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.083
WHAT? UH, NOWHERE. I WAS JUST,
YOU KNOW, DOING A THING.
YOU READY TO TALK TO DELL?

09:20.125 --> 09:23.291
OH, YEAH, SURE.
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GETTING INVOLVED.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.458
IT'S DELL.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.041
(woman speaks indistinctly)

09:27.083 --> 09:28.667
HI.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.417
SO I HEAR CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

09:31.458 --> 09:33.000
WOW.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.458
THANKS.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.208
SOMETHING YOU WANTED?
(elevator bell dings)

09:37.250 --> 09:40.208
CAN WE TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

09:40.250 --> 09:42.458
COOPER FREEDMAN?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.625
UH, YEAH, HI.
I'M DR. FREEDMAN.
WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR YOUR ARREST.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.291
PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK, SIR.
NO, NO, NO.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.959
THERE--THERE MUST BE
A MISTAKE, OFFICER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.959
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.458
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU...
I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.542
I'LL CALL THE LAWYER.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
...IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD A LAWYER,

09:59.583 --> 10:01.959
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO
REPRESENT YOU BEFORE ANY...

10:05.959 --> 10:08.041
THIS IS A PRINTOUT
OF ALL THE CALLS

10:08.083 --> 10:11.041
TO LYNN JARVEY'S CELL PHONE
IN THE PAST TWO HOURS.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
THE LAST ONE CAME FROM
A PAY PHONE HERE IN L.A.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.834
FROM HER SON EVAN.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.041
HE ASKED HIS MOM
TO STOP LOOKING FOR HIM

10:18.083 --> 10:20.875
SO YOU AND HIS DAD
WOULDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.083
YOU'VE GIVEN
MATERIAL ASSISTANCE

10:22.125 --> 10:24.125
TO AID AND ABET
A KIDNAPPER.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.375
CARRIES A SENTENCE IN CALIFORNIA

10:36.583 --> 10:41.291

I LET YOU GO.

10:43.083 --> 10:46.000
I THINK I'M GONNA WAIT
FOR MY LAWYER.

10:55.792 --> 10:59.000
THERE'S REALLY EVIDENCE
IN A BOX OF TONGUE DEPRESSORS?

11:00.959 --> 11:04.083
ALL RIGHT,
SO GIVE ME A CALL.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.542
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

11:05.583 --> 11:09.125
THEY THINK THAT COOPER
KNOWS WHERE THIS KID IS,

11:09.166 --> 11:12.125
THAT HE'S BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH HIM.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.750
YES, BUT IT'S COOPER.

11:14.792 --> 11:17.041
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'RE WRONG?

11:17.083 --> 11:19.041
I DON'T KNOW.

11:19.083 --> 11:22.500
UH, COOPER DID KNOW THAT
THE BOY WAS KIDNAPPED

11:22.542 --> 11:25.041
WHEN HE WAS HERE LAST YEAR.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.000
HE TRACED
THE BOY'S INSULIN PUMP.
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

11:28.041 --> 11:31.041
WELL, IT WAS HIS PATIENT,
SO IT'S HIS CALL.
DOESN'T MEAN HE KNOWS
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.542
WELL, LOOK, CHARLOTTE IS
WITH THE LAWYERS RIGHT NOW.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.041
THEY'RE GONNA
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.041
COOPER GAVE MEDICAL SERVICE
TO A PATIENT WHO NEEDED IT.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.792
THAT'S WHAT
HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.041
WHAT JURY IS GONNA
CONVICT HIM FOR THAT?

11:44.917 --> 11:48.041

11:57.166 --> 11:59.041

OF MEDICINE.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.125

THE GET-THINGS-DONE SCHOOL.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.208

12:06.750 --> 12:08.041

12:08.083 --> 12:10.917
ACTUALLY, I WAS...

12:10.959 --> 12:13.417
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WAS
BEST FOR MY PATIENT.
AND NAOMI ISN'T.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.417
I'M NOT PUTTING WORDS
IN YOUR MOUTH.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.041

12:17.083 --> 12:19.041

ABOUT GETTING HER WAY,

12:22.125 --> 12:24.709

12:24.750 --> 12:26.709

AND WATCH SCIENCE IN ACTION.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.083

12:33.125 --> 12:35.083

AND MY LAWYER

12:35.125 --> 12:38.125
IS GONNA FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET ME OUTTA THIS.
THEY WON'T SET BAIL

12:38.166 --> 12:41.250

HEARING TOMORROW.

12:41.291 --> 12:45.125

12:45.166 --> 12:48.458

ABOUT ME BEING IN JAIL.

A KIDNEY INFECTION.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.250

LOWER YOUR VOICE.

13:01.917 --> 13:05.625
I CAN'T SEND EVAN BACK TO
HIS STEPFATHER TO GET ABUSED.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.709

HE'S GONNA NEED ANTIBIOTICS

13:07.750 --> 13:10.583
BEFORE HE WINDS UP
NEEDING TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
NO.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.000
I NEED YOU TO PICK UP
HIS LABS--

13:13.041 --> 13:16.125
I AM NOT COMMITTING A FELONY
TO PROTECT YOUR PATIENT.
I NEED YOU

13:16.166 --> 13:19.041

13:19.083 --> 13:22.375

WHEN HEATHER TOOK BETSEY.

13:35.208 --> 13:39.458

WHEN SHE CAME BACK ON DRUGS.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.583
