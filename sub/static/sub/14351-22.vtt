WEBVTT

00:08.419 --> 00:10.745
All observation stations,
take final readings.

00:10.922 --> 00:12.749
This will be our last orbit.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074

00:21.307 --> 00:22.718
Spock.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.303
Any answers?

00:24.477 --> 00:27.727
I still read a suggestion
of carbon-cycle life forms

00:27.897 --> 00:29.177
on the planet's surface, captain.

00:29.357 --> 00:32.476
Which is scientifically impossible
under conditions there.

00:32.651 --> 00:33.849
Agreed.

00:34.028 --> 00:38.191
Mr. Sulu, switch to the planet area
I have under observation.

00:38.365 --> 00:40.025
I'm reading it now, Mr. Spock.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.325
It seems to indicate artificial power
being generated in factor 7 quantities.

00:45.497 --> 00:48.913
Which would indicate
a considerable civilisation there.

00:49.084 --> 00:52.868
What's all this poppycock
about life forms on this planet, Spock?

00:53.046 --> 00:56.047
The surface is molten lava.
The atmosphere is poisonous.

00:56.216 --> 00:58.209
Our readings could be false, captain,

00:58.385 --> 01:00.792
perhaps caused
by some natural phenomena.

01:00.971 --> 01:03.758
Well, I think Starfleet should forget
about those old space legends.

01:03.932 --> 01:05.723
There's no intelligent life here.

01:08.103 --> 01:10.309
Lieutenant.
Anything from the planet?

01:10.480 --> 01:13.647
I've repeatedly tried
on every hailing frequency, sir.

01:13.817 --> 01:16.390
There's no response on any channel.

01:16.694 --> 01:19.316
Transmit to Starfleet
our sensor readings

01:19.489 --> 01:21.980
and log entries on the planet.

01:22.659 --> 01:24.117
Surface conditions
make it impossible

01:24.285 --> 01:26.990
for us to beam down
and investigate further.

01:27.163 --> 01:29.072
We are therefore going on
to our next assignment.

01:29.248 --> 01:31.537
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Completing final orbit, sir.

01:31.709 --> 01:32.954
Prepare to warp us out.

01:37.215 --> 01:38.495
Alert status.

01:38.674 --> 01:42.174
We're being scanned, captain.
A deep probe, incredibly swift.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.729
Jim.

02:15.919 --> 02:17.995
Captain Kirk, I believe.

02:18.171 --> 02:21.089
A pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

02:22.217 --> 02:23.462
- Uhura...
- No need

02:23.635 --> 02:26.885
to check
your voice-telegraph device.

02:27.222 --> 02:31.634
- Do I gather that you recognise me?
- I recognise what you appear to be.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.886
And appearances
can be most deceiving.

02:34.062 --> 02:36.304
But not in this case, James Kirk.

02:36.481 --> 02:38.058
I am Abraham Lincoln.

02:54.206 --> 02:57.658
Space, the final frontier.

03:03.132 --> 03:07.260
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:07.428 --> 03:11.377
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:11.557 --> 03:15.341
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:15.519 --> 03:19.184
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:04.525 --> 04:06.019
Spock.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.275
Fascinating.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.855
I have been described in many ways,
Mr. Spock,

04:13.034 --> 04:14.409
but never with that word.

04:14.577 --> 04:16.486
I was requesting your analysis,
Spock.

04:16.661 --> 04:20.446
They did scan us and our vessel,
captain.

04:20.624 --> 04:23.162
And doubtless
obtained sufficient information

04:23.335 --> 04:24.498
to present this illusion.

04:24.670 --> 04:25.785
Illusion?

04:27.464 --> 04:29.955
Captain, will you permit me
to come aboard your vessel?

04:30.134 --> 04:33.467
No doubt you have devices
which can check my reality.

04:37.099 --> 04:40.432
We'd be honoured
to have you aboard,

04:40.602 --> 04:41.977
Mr. President.

04:43.730 --> 04:45.308
Do you still measure time
in minutes?

04:46.942 --> 04:49.267
We can convert to it, sir.

04:50.445 --> 04:54.443
Then you should be directly
over my position in...

04:54.616 --> 04:55.731
There.

04:55.909 --> 04:58.993
Exactly 12 and one half minutes.

04:59.162 --> 05:01.404
Until then, captain.

05:19.348 --> 05:21.222
Thank you, Mr. Lemli.

05:25.813 --> 05:27.438
Small change occurring there,
captain.

05:35.072 --> 05:38.239
- Magnification 4, helm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

05:42.871 --> 05:45.541
An area of approximately
1,000 square kilometres.

05:45.707 --> 05:47.830
It measures completely Earth-like.

05:48.001 --> 05:50.457
Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere,
sir.

05:50.629 --> 05:52.004
He called it to the second, sir.

05:52.172 --> 05:55.339
We'll be over it
in exactly 12 minutes, now.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.345
Security, send a detachment
to the Transporter Room immediately,

06:00.514 --> 06:05.888
phaser side arms, and be prepared
to give presidential honours.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.516
Jim, do you really believe
he's Abraham Lincoln?

06:08.688 --> 06:10.562
Well, it's obvious he believes it.

06:10.732 --> 06:14.979
Oh, Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock,
full dress uniforms.

06:17.030 --> 06:19.188
Full dress? Presidential honours?

06:19.365 --> 06:21.239
What is all this nonsense,
Mr. Dickerson?

06:21.409 --> 06:23.698
I understand President Lincoln's
coming aboard, sir.

06:23.870 --> 06:25.198
Oh, you're daft, man.

06:25.371 --> 06:27.447
All I know, sir,
is what the captain tells me,

06:27.623 --> 06:31.372
and he says he'll have the hide of
the first man that so much as smiles.

06:33.296 --> 06:37.128
I'd have expected sanity
from the ship's surgeon, at least.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.625
President Lincoln, indeed.

06:39.802 --> 06:42.756
No doubt to be followed by Louis
of France and Robert the Bruce.

06:42.930 --> 06:46.928
If so, we'll execute appropriate
honours to each, Mr. Scott.

06:47.101 --> 06:48.595
- Aye, sir.
- Gentlemen.

06:48.769 --> 06:50.394
I don't for a moment believe

06:50.563 --> 06:52.639
that President Lincoln
is actually coming aboard.

06:52.815 --> 06:57.144
But we're dealing with an unknown,
apparently highly advanced life form.

06:57.319 --> 06:59.395
Until we know,

06:59.571 --> 07:02.572
when in Rome,
we'll do as the Romans do.

07:02.950 --> 07:07.410
Bridge to Transporter Room.
One minute to overhead position.

07:07.579 --> 07:09.572
Locked onto something.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.079
Does that appear human to you,
Mr. Spock?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.958
Fascinating.

07:14.127 --> 07:17.081
For a moment,
it appeared almost mineral.

07:17.255 --> 07:20.541
Like living rock
with heavy fore claws.

07:20.717 --> 07:23.208
It's settling down now
to completely human readings.

07:23.386 --> 07:26.091
We can beam it aboard
anytime now, sir.

07:26.264 --> 07:28.055
Dr. McCoy.

07:28.224 --> 07:33.182
Take tricorder readings,
and see if it is human.

07:33.938 --> 07:37.806
Appropriate ruffles and flourishes,
Mr. Spock.

07:37.984 --> 07:39.941
Security, stand ready.

07:40.111 --> 07:44.061
Phaser team,
set ready for heavy stun.

07:47.285 --> 07:48.827
Band honours ready, captain.

07:49.871 --> 07:51.530
Energize.

08:19.942 --> 08:23.939
The USS Enterprise is honoured
to have you aboard, Mr. President.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.860
Strange.

08:31.286 --> 08:32.566
Where are the musicians?

08:32.996 --> 08:35.238
That's taped music, sir.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.499
A starship on active duty
never carries an honour detachment.

08:38.793 --> 08:41.498
Taped music, you say.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.916
Well, perhaps Mr. Spock
will be good enough

08:45.091 --> 08:46.466
to explain that to me later.

08:47.719 --> 08:50.506
A most interesting way
to come aboard, captain.

08:50.847 --> 08:52.721
What was the device used?

08:53.182 --> 08:55.258
An energy-matter scrambler, sir.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.890
The molecules in your body
are converted into energy,

08:58.062 --> 08:59.225
then beamed into this chamber

08:59.397 --> 09:02.232
and reconverted back
into their original pattern.

09:03.693 --> 09:06.397
Well, since I'm obviously here

09:07.196 --> 09:09.236
and quite whole,

09:09.699 --> 09:12.403
whatever you mean
apparently works very well indeed.

09:12.576 --> 09:16.740
Gentlemen, if those are weapons,
please lower them.

09:16.914 --> 09:20.199
At my age,
I'm afraid I'm not very dangerous.

09:20.376 --> 09:22.084
Human, Jim.

09:22.836 --> 09:26.834
All too human, Dr. McCoy.
Happy to make your acquaintance, sir.

09:28.717 --> 09:30.377
Mr. President.

09:30.552 --> 09:33.719
May I present my officers?

09:34.598 --> 09:36.306
Commander Spock,
second in command,

09:36.475 --> 09:40.887
Engineering Officer Scott
and Security Officer Dickerson.

09:41.521 --> 09:45.353
Mr. Spock, Mr. Scott, Mr. Dickerson.

09:45.525 --> 09:47.732
Gentlemen,
I hope to talk to each of you.

09:47.903 --> 09:51.402
But meanwhile, your captain
is consumed with questions,

09:51.573 --> 09:53.862
and I shall do my utmost
to answer them.

09:54.034 --> 09:57.983
And I trust your duties will permit time
to answer some of mine.

09:58.163 --> 10:00.239
At your service, captain.

10:00.915 --> 10:04.035
Lieutenant Dickerson, you
and your men may return to quarters.

10:04.711 --> 10:06.502
Mr. President.

10:06.671 --> 10:08.913
- Spock.
- A most interesting vessel.

10:19.267 --> 10:22.433
Just what was it you locked onto
before you beamed him aboard?

10:22.603 --> 10:24.928
You heard Mr. Spock yourself.

10:25.106 --> 10:28.688
Mineral, he called it. Like living rock.

10:28.859 --> 10:31.611
- And that became Lincoln.
- I couldn't tell.

10:31.779 --> 10:35.148
May have been another figure
down there standing by.

10:35.324 --> 10:37.032
What do you make of it?

10:38.619 --> 10:40.861
I'm not quite sure.

10:48.253 --> 10:51.171
Captain's log, stardate 5906.4.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.791
Who or what has been beamed
aboard our vessel?

10:54.968 --> 10:58.551
An alien who has changed himself
into this form? An illusion?

10:58.722 --> 11:00.346
I cannot conceive it possible

11:00.515 --> 11:03.765
that Abraham Lincoln could have
actually been reincarnated.

11:03.935 --> 11:07.636
And yet his kindness,
his gentle wisdom, his humour,

11:07.814 --> 11:11.148
everything about him is so right.

11:13.737 --> 11:16.821
Yes, if I recall, your Union army
observation balloons

11:16.990 --> 11:19.481
were tendered 600 or so feet high.

11:19.659 --> 11:23.739
We're 643 miles
above the surface of this planet.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.372
You can measure great distances
that closely?

11:30.545 --> 11:32.336
We do, sir.

11:33.798 --> 11:39.005
Six hundred forty-three miles,
2,021 feet, 2.04 inches,

11:39.178 --> 11:41.550
at this moment,
using your old-style measurements.

11:43.307 --> 11:44.849
Bless me.

11:45.184 --> 11:46.844
Excuse me, Captain Kirk.

11:47.019 --> 11:48.597
- Yes, lieutenant.
- Mr. Scott...

11:48.771 --> 11:50.847
What a charming Negress.

11:53.108 --> 11:54.567
Forgive me, my dear.

11:54.735 --> 11:57.024
I know that in my time,
some used that term

11:57.196 --> 11:58.654
as a description of property.

11:58.822 --> 12:01.942
But why should I object
to that term, sir?

12:02.326 --> 12:05.777
You see, in our century,
we've learned not to fear words.

12:07.497 --> 12:10.701
May I present our communications
officer, Lieutenant Uhura?

12:10.876 --> 12:12.952
The foolishness of my century

12:13.128 --> 12:15.583
had me apologising
where no offence was given.

12:15.755 --> 12:18.128
We've each learned
to be delighted with what we are.

12:19.718 --> 12:22.802
The Vulcans learned that
centuries before we did.

12:22.971 --> 12:25.544
It is basic
to the Vulcan philosophy, sir.

12:25.724 --> 12:29.638
The combination of a number of things
to make existence worthwhile.

12:29.811 --> 12:34.022
Yes, philosophy of Nome,
meaning "all."

12:40.154 --> 12:41.317
How did I know that?

12:44.492 --> 12:48.572
Just as I seem to know
that on the planet's surface,

12:48.746 --> 12:50.573
you will meet
one of the greatest living Vulcans

12:50.748 --> 12:52.657
in all the long history of your planet.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.040
My mind cannot recall his name,

12:55.211 --> 12:57.203
but I know he will be there.

13:02.176 --> 13:04.252
What is it that powers your vessel,
captain?

13:04.428 --> 13:06.088
- May I see your engine room?
- Certainly.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.426
Our engineering officer...

13:07.598 --> 13:11.430
Has been waiting in the briefing room
for you, sir, for over two hours.

13:11.602 --> 13:13.393
Oh, dear.

13:14.062 --> 13:16.020
If you'll forgive me,
our communications officer...

13:16.190 --> 13:19.274
I would be delighted
to have her as guide.

13:19.610 --> 13:22.480
Forgive me again.
We'll rejoin you shortly.

13:22.863 --> 13:23.942
Where the devil are they?

13:24.114 --> 13:26.439
They're probably looking up
a plate of haggis in the galley.

13:26.616 --> 13:27.779
They've been everywhere else.

13:27.951 --> 13:30.240
Sorry to have been delayed,
gentlemen.

13:30.412 --> 13:33.282
Jim, I would be the last to advise you
on your command image...

13:33.456 --> 13:35.283
I doubt that, Bones, but continue.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.118
Do I have to lay it out for you?

13:37.294 --> 13:41.706
Practically the entire crew's seen you
treat this impostor like the real thing,

13:41.881 --> 13:44.040
when he can't possibly
be the real article.

13:44.217 --> 13:45.711
Lincoln died three centuries ago

13:45.885 --> 13:47.925
on a planet
hundreds of light-years away.

13:48.096 --> 13:51.299
More that direction, engineer.

13:53.309 --> 13:55.883
You're the science officer.
Why aren't you, well,

13:56.062 --> 13:59.016
doing whatever a science officer does
at a time like this?

13:59.482 --> 14:02.103
I am, doctor.
I am observing the alien.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.727
Well, at last.
At least somebody agrees with us.

14:04.904 --> 14:07.276
- He's an alien.
- Yes, of course he's an alien.

14:07.448 --> 14:08.728
And he's potentially dangerous.

14:08.908 --> 14:12.656
Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird.

14:12.828 --> 14:14.370
Gentlemen.

14:14.872 --> 14:18.870
As you know,
Mr. Spock and I have been invited

14:19.043 --> 14:22.162
to beam down to the planet's surface
with him.

14:22.338 --> 14:25.042
- Any comments on that?
- Yes, a big one.

14:25.215 --> 14:28.715
Suddenly, miraculously,
we see a small spot

14:28.886 --> 14:31.174
of Earth-type environment
down there.

14:31.346 --> 14:32.841
Now, is it really there,

14:33.015 --> 14:35.221
or do we just think we see it
down there?

14:35.392 --> 14:38.346
You might beam down
into a sea of molten lava.

14:38.687 --> 14:41.178
But why would he wanna kill
only two of us?

14:41.356 --> 14:43.598
It would be illogical.
With such abilities,

14:43.775 --> 14:47.109
they could as easily trick us
into destroying the entire vessel.

14:47.279 --> 14:49.022
Are you implying, Mr. Spock,

14:49.197 --> 14:51.569
that it's probably safe
to beam down there?

14:52.075 --> 14:53.355
No, I'm not, doctor.

14:53.535 --> 14:56.026
There's no doubt they want us
down there for some hidden purpose.

14:56.204 --> 14:59.324
Otherwise, they would have revealed
some logical reason for all of this.

15:01.793 --> 15:05.411
Why Lincoln, Spock?
Any speculation on that?

15:06.255 --> 15:09.541
Speculation is unnecessary, captain.
The answer is clear.

15:09.717 --> 15:13.631
President Lincoln has always been
a very personal hero to you.

15:13.805 --> 15:16.212
What better way
to titillate your curiosity

15:16.390 --> 15:18.182
than to make him come alive
for you?

15:19.644 --> 15:21.304
But not only to me, Spock.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.354
Agreed.
I too experienced his charm.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.980
It is a magnificent work
of duplication.

15:28.152 --> 15:31.069
But he holds
a special involvement to you, Jim.

15:31.238 --> 15:33.445
And I think it's interesting,
inasmuch as you're the one

15:33.616 --> 15:36.285
who's going to make the decision
whether to beam down or not.

15:39.747 --> 15:41.324
Don't do it, captain.

15:53.593 --> 15:57.840
The very reason
for the existence of our starships

15:58.014 --> 16:00.885
is contact with other life.

16:01.268 --> 16:03.141
Although the method
is beyond our comprehension,

16:03.311 --> 16:06.846
we have been offered contact.

16:10.693 --> 16:13.730
Therefore, I shall beam down.
Mr. Spock, as for you...

16:13.905 --> 16:16.941
Captain, since I was included
in the invitation to make contact,

16:17.116 --> 16:18.361
I must beam down with you.

16:18.534 --> 16:20.242
- You're both out of your head.
- Aye, sir.

16:20.411 --> 16:22.618
And you're on the edge
of insubordination.

16:22.789 --> 16:24.615
Would I be on the edge
of insubordination

16:24.791 --> 16:28.124
to remind the captain that this smells
of something happening to him

16:28.294 --> 16:30.750
that I might not be able to patch
back together again?

16:30.922 --> 16:32.416
Aye.

16:33.716 --> 16:36.172
Gentlemen, your concern is noted
and appreciated.

16:36.344 --> 16:39.962
Mr. Spock, standard dress,
tricorders and phasers.

16:40.139 --> 16:42.630
We will guide President Lincoln
to the Transporter Room.

16:42.808 --> 16:45.726
We'll beam down immediately.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.988
Standing by, Mr. Scott.

16:58.157 --> 17:00.196
Transporter Room to Bridge,
standing by.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.154
We are now locked
in synchronous orbit, Mr. Scott.

17:03.328 --> 17:04.953
Sensors continue to show the area

17:05.122 --> 17:07.328
as completely Earth-like
in all respects.

17:07.499 --> 17:11.746
If they are wrong
and they do beam into a pool of lava...

17:11.920 --> 17:15.123
Then they're dead men.
I couldn't pull them back in time.

17:21.512 --> 17:23.173
All right, Mr. Scott. Energize.

17:35.026 --> 17:36.520
Scotty.

18:00.968 --> 18:02.462
Captain.

18:03.971 --> 18:07.304
Our phasers and tricorders
did not beam down with us.

18:10.728 --> 18:13.218
Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise?
Enterprise, come in.

18:13.397 --> 18:15.389
Kirk to Enterprise.

18:15.732 --> 18:17.808
Enterprise, come in.

18:18.527 --> 18:21.777
Undamaged, yet something
is preventing them from functioning.

18:21.947 --> 18:24.616
Come in, landing party. Report.

18:25.867 --> 18:29.568
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Can you read us?

18:30.789 --> 18:33.576
If they're all right,
they should have reported in.

18:34.876 --> 18:37.082
- Your explanation, sir?
- Well, I have none.

18:37.253 --> 18:39.080
To me,
this seems quite as it should be.

18:39.255 --> 18:40.370
Why were our weapons taken?

18:40.548 --> 18:42.042
Why can't we communicate
with our ship?

18:42.217 --> 18:45.835
Please, believe me. I know nothing
other than what I already told you.

18:46.012 --> 18:48.420
The game is over.
We've treated you with courtesy.

18:48.598 --> 18:50.637
We've gone along with what
and who you think you are.

18:50.808 --> 18:54.592
Despite the seeming contradictions,
all is as it appears to be.

18:54.771 --> 18:57.344
I am Abraham Lincoln.

18:57.523 --> 19:01.355
Just as I am whom I appear to be.

19:02.612 --> 19:04.818
- Surak.
- Who?

19:06.324 --> 19:09.075
The greatest of all
who ever lived on our planet, captain.

19:09.952 --> 19:11.945
The father of all we became.

19:12.538 --> 19:14.447
All-ship system going dead.

19:14.623 --> 19:15.952
Switch to reserve power.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.323
All decks, report status.

19:17.501 --> 19:21.119
All decks, report status.
All decks, report status.

19:21.296 --> 19:25.424
Bridge to Engineering. Come in.
What's happening to our power?

19:26.260 --> 19:27.754
Bridge to Engineering. Report.

19:27.928 --> 19:30.466
Everything's out.
We've switched to reserve power.

19:30.639 --> 19:32.715
We've lost all power
in the warp engines.

19:32.891 --> 19:34.848
How is it, Mr. Sulu?

19:35.018 --> 19:37.972
No answer yet on what caused it.
They're standing by.

19:39.064 --> 19:41.140
Shut down all
but the most necessary systems.

19:41.817 --> 19:45.517
- No damage report, Mr. Scott.
- No indication of engine damage, sir.

19:45.695 --> 19:48.945
- Engage restart cycle.
- I can't. I don't understand.

19:49.115 --> 19:51.441
- Start emergency procedures.
- Aye, aye, sir.

19:53.495 --> 19:55.986
Live long and prosper, Spock.

19:56.164 --> 19:57.742
May you also, Captain Kirk.

19:58.166 --> 20:01.001
It is not logical that you are Surak.

20:01.169 --> 20:04.620
There is no fact, extrapolation of fact,
or theory,

20:04.797 --> 20:05.960
which would make possible...

20:06.132 --> 20:09.797
Whatever I am,
would it harm you to give response?

20:12.346 --> 20:15.715
Live long and prosper,
image of Surak,

20:15.892 --> 20:18.892
father of all we now hold true.

20:20.980 --> 20:25.274
The image of Surak read in your face
what is in your mind, Spock.

20:25.526 --> 20:30.733
As I turned and my eyes beheld you,
I displayed emotion.

20:30.906 --> 20:32.400
I beg forgiveness.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.821
The cause was more than sufficient.

20:37.204 --> 20:39.529
Let us speak no further of it.

20:40.207 --> 20:42.413
In my time,
we knew not of earthmen.

20:42.793 --> 20:45.747
I am pleased to see
that we have differences.

20:46.046 --> 20:49.794
May we together become greater
than the sum of both of us.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.505
Spock, we'll not go along
with these charades any longer.

21:00.769 --> 21:03.141
You will have an answer soon,
captain.

21:11.613 --> 21:14.448
Our world is called Excalbia.

21:14.616 --> 21:17.451
Countless who live on that planet
are watching.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.275
Before this drama unfolds,

21:19.454 --> 21:23.950
we give welcome
to the ones named Kirk and Spock.

21:24.625 --> 21:29.916
We know nothing of your world,
or your customs.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.880
What do you mean,

21:32.174 --> 21:34.084
"drama about to unfold"?

21:34.427 --> 21:36.503
You're intelligent life form,

21:36.679 --> 21:39.763
so I am surprised you do not perceive
the honour we do you.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.972
Have we not created in this place
on our planet

21:42.143 --> 21:44.812
a stage identical to your own world?

21:44.979 --> 21:46.971
We perceive that we were invited
to come down here,

21:47.147 --> 21:49.057
and we came in friendship.

21:49.233 --> 21:50.941
And you have deprived us

21:51.110 --> 21:54.194
of our instruments
to examine your world,

21:54.363 --> 21:57.399
to defend ourselves,
to communicate with our vessel.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.443
Your objection is well taken.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.078
We shall communicate
with your vessel

22:02.246 --> 22:07.121
so that your fellow life forms
may also enjoy and profit

22:07.834 --> 22:09.708
from the play.

22:09.878 --> 22:11.871
Behold.

22:28.438 --> 22:32.435
Captain, Mr. Spock, some of these
you may know through history.

22:32.609 --> 22:34.815
Genghis Khan, for one.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.144
And Colonel Green,
who led a genocidal war

22:37.321 --> 22:40.488
early in the 21 st century on Earth.

22:40.658 --> 22:43.493
Zora, who experimented
with the body chemistry

22:43.661 --> 22:46.069
of subject tribes on Tiburon.

22:46.247 --> 22:48.572
Kahless the Unforgettable,

22:48.749 --> 22:51.703
the Klingon who set the pattern
for his planet's tyrannies.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.754
We welcome the vessel Enterprise

22:55.923 --> 22:59.458
to our solar system
and to our spectacle.

22:59.718 --> 23:01.794
Well, at least the captain
and Spock are safe.

23:01.971 --> 23:04.462
It's a confrontation of some sort.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.684
Those are all figures out of history.
Notoriously evil.

23:08.852 --> 23:10.845
We ask you to observe with us

23:11.021 --> 23:13.263
the confrontation
of the two opposing philosophies

23:13.440 --> 23:17.141
you term "good" and "evil."

23:17.569 --> 23:20.025
Since this is our first experiment
with earthlings,

23:20.197 --> 23:22.355
our theme is a simple one:

23:22.532 --> 23:24.192
Survival.

23:24.367 --> 23:25.648
Life and death.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.659
Your philosophies are alien to us,

23:28.830 --> 23:33.539
and we wish to understand them
and discover which is the stronger.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.711
We learn
by observing such spectacles.

23:37.088 --> 23:39.579
What do you mean, "survival"?

23:40.049 --> 23:41.460
The word is explicit.

23:41.634 --> 23:44.635
If you and Spock survive,
you return to your vessel.

23:45.638 --> 23:47.382
If you do not,

23:50.560 --> 23:52.469
your existence is ended.

24:04.365 --> 24:06.737
Can we beam the captain
and Spock back up?

24:06.909 --> 24:07.988
We don't have the power.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.410
They'll come aboard
a mass of dying flesh.

24:12.039 --> 24:13.996
Well, can we send
the phasers down?

24:14.166 --> 24:17.333
There's nothing we can do, doctor.
Nothing but watch them.

24:17.628 --> 24:20.748
He's skimmed the worst ones
in history to face them.

24:20.923 --> 24:22.962
But they're not real.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.968
Any more than that Lincoln
or Surak.

24:29.932 --> 24:31.260
What do the sensors read?

24:31.433 --> 24:35.300
As life forms. They are living beings.

24:36.271 --> 24:38.679
Could they be aliens,
projecting an illusion?

24:38.857 --> 24:41.430
The readings
are those of humanoids.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.066
Why do you hesitate?

24:45.071 --> 24:46.945
Do you wish further clarification?

24:47.240 --> 24:50.739
Your choice of action is unlimited,
as is your choice of weapons.

24:51.494 --> 24:54.281
Should you wish to use any,
you may fabricate anything you desire

24:54.456 --> 24:57.409
out of what you can find around you.

24:58.334 --> 24:59.497
Captain.

25:07.468 --> 25:09.959
Mr. Spock and I refuse to participate.

25:10.138 --> 25:12.510
You will decide otherwise.

25:33.369 --> 25:35.278
Analysis, Spock.

25:35.746 --> 25:37.785
Why do they want us to fight?

25:38.123 --> 25:40.792
It may be exactly as explained,
captain.

25:40.959 --> 25:43.629
Our concept of good and evil
is strange to them.

25:43.795 --> 25:46.713
Perhaps they wish to determine
which is strongest.

25:46.882 --> 25:49.088
And they'll get their answer
if it kills us.

25:53.346 --> 25:55.505
I'm afraid none of us may leave,
gentlemen,

25:55.682 --> 25:57.971
until we do what it demands of us.

26:02.188 --> 26:03.813
Captain Kirk.

26:04.733 --> 26:06.013
May I speak with you?

26:07.569 --> 26:10.060
I quite agree with your attitude
toward this charade.

26:10.238 --> 26:12.396
It's ridiculous to think
that we should take part in it.

26:13.575 --> 26:14.737
What do you want?

26:15.159 --> 26:17.401
Well, the same as you do.
To get out of here.

26:17.578 --> 26:20.283
I have no quarrel with you,
any more than you have with me.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.618
You're somewhat different

26:23.793 --> 26:26.829
than the way history paints you,
Colonel Green.

26:27.004 --> 26:29.709
History tends to exaggerate.

26:30.049 --> 26:33.169
I suggest we call a halt to this
at once

26:33.344 --> 26:36.345
and see if we can't find some way
out of our difficulties.

26:36.514 --> 26:39.384
My associates are in full agreement
with me.

26:40.851 --> 26:42.393
Captain.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.677
You were tricked into coming here,
weren't you?

26:45.856 --> 26:47.979
So were we all.

26:50.069 --> 26:51.860
Where do you come from?

26:53.322 --> 26:55.231
I can't remember.

26:56.241 --> 26:57.735
Isn't that strange?

26:57.910 --> 27:00.661
My memory
used to be quite remarkable.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.992
Well, wherever it was,
I want to get back.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.702
So it seems to me, captain,
that we have a common cause.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.417
And our enemy is that creature.

27:13.592 --> 27:14.967
What do you propose?

27:15.302 --> 27:19.631
That we combine forces
and reason some way to overcome it.

27:21.516 --> 27:23.592
You were notorious, Colonel Green,

27:23.768 --> 27:28.062
for striking at your enemies
in the midst of negotiating with them.

27:28.439 --> 27:32.982
But that was centuries ago, captain,
and not altogether true.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.904
No, there's much I would change now,
if I could.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.194
Don't let prejudice
and rumour sway you.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.865
Captain.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.280
How can we warn him?

28:28.248 --> 28:29.659
Anyone hurt?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.371
Well, I feel my clothing
is somewhat damaged.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.838
But how delightful to discover
at my age that I can still wrestle.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.248
- Mr. Spock?
- I'm all right, captain.

28:39.425 --> 28:42.130
However, I suggest that we prepare
ourselves for another attack.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.675
No. I think Colonel Green is right.

28:44.847 --> 28:47.848
That rocklike thing is our enemy.
Not those illusions.

28:48.017 --> 28:52.181
For an illusion, my opponent carried
a considerable punch.

28:52.355 --> 28:57.017
Oh, I forgot.
You consider me an illusion too.

28:57.485 --> 29:01.814
The captain speaks wisely.
Those four are not our enemy.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.730
We should arrive together
at a peaceful settlement.

29:05.409 --> 29:07.201
I am disappointed.

29:08.454 --> 29:10.861
You display no interest
in the honour we do you.

29:12.291 --> 29:14.782
We offer you an opportunity
to become our teachers

29:14.960 --> 29:17.582
by demonstrating whether good or evil
is more powerful.

29:19.923 --> 29:22.758
Do you find my body heat distressing,
captain?

29:22.926 --> 29:24.966
You forget the nature of this planet.

29:25.137 --> 29:29.051
I must conclude that your species
requires a cause to fight for.

29:29.266 --> 29:32.101
You may now communicate
with your ship.

29:41.027 --> 29:43.862
Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise,

29:44.030 --> 29:45.062
come in.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.900
Scott to Engineering.
Report, lieutenant.

29:47.075 --> 29:50.242
Emergency increasing, sir.
Deterioration has just started, sir.

29:50.412 --> 29:52.071
Give me that again, man.
I cannot hear you.

29:52.330 --> 29:54.157
Mr. Scott, I have the captain.

29:54.332 --> 29:55.791
Scotty, do you read me?

29:56.084 --> 29:57.957
Mr. Scott, I have the captain.

29:58.127 --> 30:01.627
Engineering, check for radiation.
Get a repair crew on it at once.

30:01.798 --> 30:04.123
I have already, sir.
We can't seem to stop it.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.135
- Is there a danger of detonation?
- Estimating four hours, sir.

30:07.303 --> 30:10.008
Red alert, captain.
Mr. Scott is standing by.

30:10.181 --> 30:12.588
- What caused the red alert?
- I don't know yet, sir.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.890
- Captain.
- Scotty, beam us up fast.

30:15.061 --> 30:17.433
I cannot.
We have a complete power failure.

30:17.605 --> 30:19.930
We're on emergency
battery power only.

30:20.107 --> 30:23.061
- What happened?
- I can't explain it, sir.

30:23.235 --> 30:26.355
But the matter and antimatter
are in red-zone proximity.

30:26.530 --> 30:27.728
What caused that?

30:27.907 --> 30:31.192
There's no knowing,
and there's no stopping it either.

30:31.368 --> 30:32.613
The shielding is breaking down,

30:32.786 --> 30:35.823
and I estimate four hours
before it goes completely.

30:38.584 --> 30:40.790
Four hours before the ship blows up.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.540
The estimate is quite correct.

30:45.841 --> 30:49.091
Your ship will blow itself to bits
within four hours, captain,

30:49.886 --> 30:52.175
unless you defeat the others
before then.

30:52.472 --> 30:55.177
Is that cause enough to fight for?

30:56.518 --> 30:57.893
What if they defeat us?

30:58.061 --> 31:00.517
To save your ship and your crew,

31:00.689 --> 31:01.720
you have to win.

31:04.692 --> 31:07.314
Scotty, inform Starfleet Command.
Disengage nacelles.

31:07.487 --> 31:09.278
Jettison, if possible.
Mr. Spock, assist him.

31:09.447 --> 31:11.404
Advise and analyse.

31:11.574 --> 31:13.152
Scotty?

31:14.661 --> 31:15.906
Scotty?

31:16.079 --> 31:19.530
Your communicators
no longer function, captain.

31:19.999 --> 31:22.668
You may proceed with the spectacle.

31:23.085 --> 31:24.710
James,

31:24.879 --> 31:27.500
the war is forced upon us.

31:28.007 --> 31:29.916
History repeats itself.

31:39.185 --> 31:44.427
Supplemental log, stardate 5906.5.
Engineer Scott reporting.

31:44.607 --> 31:46.979
The Enterprise is doomed to explode
in two hours

31:47.151 --> 31:48.349
if Captain Kirk is defeated

31:48.527 --> 31:51.018
by the enemy
on the surface of the planet.

31:51.196 --> 31:54.233
The enormous power of the Enterprise
has been neutralised,

31:54.408 --> 31:57.658
and we sit here watching,
unable to assist.

32:00.497 --> 32:02.288
- Did you set the traps?
- Yes.

32:02.457 --> 32:03.868
What'd you find?
What are they doing?

32:04.042 --> 32:06.035
They've done nothing.
They've not armed themselves,

32:06.211 --> 32:08.334
nor prepared for any kind of defence.

32:08.505 --> 32:11.956
- I say attack now and finish them.
- With what, these?

32:12.133 --> 32:16.380
- Better than what they have.
- No, it's not advantage enough.

32:16.554 --> 32:19.045
I wanna make sure
the odds are in our favour.

32:19.224 --> 32:21.465
Overwhelm and devastate.
That's the way to get power

32:21.643 --> 32:23.801
and to hold it.
And I mean to do that.

32:24.521 --> 32:28.388
There's nothing immoral
about fighting an illusion, Mr. Spock.

32:28.566 --> 32:31.104
We play their game, fight,

32:31.277 --> 32:32.985
or lose the ship
and all the crewmen aboard.

32:33.154 --> 32:35.360
And if they are real, captain?

32:40.578 --> 32:42.405
We'll use this

32:45.249 --> 32:47.040
as a base.

32:47.877 --> 32:49.916
It's defensible.

32:55.342 --> 32:57.002
They can't approach
without being seen.

32:57.177 --> 32:58.802
Are we fighting a defensive war,
James?

32:58.971 --> 33:01.509
No, we don't have time.
But if things do go against us,

33:01.682 --> 33:03.342
I want a place to retreat to.

33:03.517 --> 33:05.556
What I wanna do now
is scout them out,

33:05.727 --> 33:07.305
find their weaknesses and attack.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.728
- Do you drink whisky?
- Occasionally, why?

33:10.899 --> 33:14.149
Because you have qualities much like
those of another man I admire greatly.

33:14.319 --> 33:16.146
- General Grant.
- Thank you...

33:18.198 --> 33:19.989
Thank you.

33:20.158 --> 33:21.783
Mr. Spock, we'll need weapons.

33:21.952 --> 33:24.822
I believe the ancient Vulcans
made something like a boomerang.

33:24.996 --> 33:26.028
Yes, captain.

33:26.331 --> 33:29.083
And slings and spears.

33:29.250 --> 33:32.833
Slings. Mr. President,
You used a sling as a boy.

33:33.004 --> 33:34.119
Indeed I did.

33:34.297 --> 33:36.753
Captain.

33:36.925 --> 33:40.044
Logic dictates
that we consider another course.

33:46.434 --> 33:48.557
We don't have much time, Spock.

33:49.312 --> 33:54.187
In my time on Vulcan,
we also faced these same alternatives.

33:54.567 --> 33:58.232
We'd suffered devastating wars,
which nearly destroyed our planet.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.646
Another was about to begin.

34:01.824 --> 34:03.567
We were torn.

34:03.993 --> 34:07.492
But out of our suffering,
some of us found the discipline to act.

34:07.997 --> 34:12.326
We sent emissaries
to our opponents to propose peace.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.663
The first were killed.

34:14.837 --> 34:16.746
But others followed.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.710
Ultimately, we achieved peace,

34:19.882 --> 34:21.792
which has lasted since then.

34:22.427 --> 34:25.344
Circumstances were different then,
Surak.

34:26.514 --> 34:29.599
The face of war has never changed,
captain.

34:29.851 --> 34:33.351
Surely it is more logical
to heal than kill.

34:33.522 --> 34:37.139
I'm afraid that kind of logic
doesn't apply here.

34:37.317 --> 34:40.271
That is precisely why
we should not fight.

34:40.445 --> 34:43.315
My ship is at stake.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.114
I will not harm others, captain.

34:55.376 --> 34:58.046
His convictions are most profound
in this matter, captain.

34:58.212 --> 34:59.588
So are mine, Spock.

34:59.756 --> 35:02.128
If I believed that there was
a peaceful way out of this...

35:02.300 --> 35:04.838
This risk will be mine alone.

35:05.011 --> 35:08.344
If I fail, you'll lose nothing.

35:08.598 --> 35:10.389
After all, I'm no warrior.

35:10.558 --> 35:13.843
The captain knows
that I have fought at his side before

35:14.020 --> 35:16.392
and will do so now, if need be.

35:16.564 --> 35:21.309
However, I too am a Vulcan,
bred to peace.

35:21.485 --> 35:23.394
Let him attempt it.

35:24.738 --> 35:28.403
- You saw how treacherously they act.
- Oh, yes.

35:29.743 --> 35:34.286
But perhaps it's our belief in peace

35:34.456 --> 35:36.413
that is actually being tested.

35:43.048 --> 35:46.915
I have no authority over you.
You may do as you think best.

35:47.386 --> 35:48.928
Thank you.

35:50.931 --> 35:53.338
May you live long and prosper.

35:59.314 --> 36:00.559
The weapons, gentlemen.

36:04.611 --> 36:06.568
In case he fails.

36:13.953 --> 36:15.447
Colonel.

36:22.753 --> 36:24.164
No.

36:35.307 --> 36:38.925
Let's hear what he has to say.
We may find it useful.

36:43.941 --> 36:45.980
Stop there, Vulcan.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.488
- State your purpose.
- I come in peace to propose peace.

36:50.906 --> 36:52.281
Are you surrendering?

36:52.449 --> 36:55.735
I'm doing what I consider best
for all of us.

36:56.328 --> 36:59.282
If you choose to regard that
as surrender,

36:59.456 --> 37:00.998
I accept your definition.

37:01.666 --> 37:04.157
One of those peace lovers, colonel.

37:04.503 --> 37:06.294
Why are you doing this?

37:06.463 --> 37:07.957
Do you speak for the others?

37:08.590 --> 37:11.923
No, I speak for myself
because I abhor violence.

37:12.093 --> 37:15.047
But if you accept the solution I offer,
they too will accept it.

37:16.181 --> 37:18.220
How can I be sure?

37:18.391 --> 37:20.514
I think you're trying to trick me,
Vulcan.

37:21.019 --> 37:23.307
I think that while you're here
talking peace,

37:23.855 --> 37:25.812
the others are preparing to attack.

37:26.274 --> 37:29.559
No, Colonel. They are at their base,
awaiting an answer.

37:29.736 --> 37:31.894
How can I believe that?

37:32.196 --> 37:35.897
No one talks peace unless he's ready
to back it up with war.

37:36.075 --> 37:39.029
He talks peace
if it is the only way to live.

37:39.203 --> 37:40.911
Then tell me,

37:41.330 --> 37:44.117
what do you have to gain
if we accept?

37:44.291 --> 37:47.328
Nothing but the knowledge
that I have done what I believe in.

37:47.503 --> 37:48.783
Well, what do I get out of it?

37:50.422 --> 37:52.711
I fight for gain, Vulcan.

37:52.883 --> 37:54.259
What do I gain here?

37:54.552 --> 37:57.339
Your life and the lives of the others.

38:02.643 --> 38:05.312
You said yourself, colonel,
that we have common cause:

38:05.479 --> 38:06.510
To survive.

38:07.564 --> 38:09.723
Together we can.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.563
But not by warring.

38:11.735 --> 38:13.941
- Why don't we kill him?
- No.

38:14.112 --> 38:16.568
He's our means to finish them all.

38:16.740 --> 38:20.903
Colonel, surely you accept
the logic of this?

38:21.077 --> 38:25.490
- What is your answer?
- You are very persuasive, Vulcan.

38:25.665 --> 38:28.583
I'd like to come out of this
with a whole skin.

38:28.752 --> 38:31.918
Perhaps I can convince
my associates

38:32.088 --> 38:34.959
that it would be to their advantage
also.

38:55.444 --> 38:58.979
Your Surak is a brave man.

38:59.156 --> 39:01.694
Men of peace usually are, captain.

39:02.326 --> 39:06.158
On Vulcan, he is revered
as the father of our civilisation.

39:06.789 --> 39:09.825
The father image
holds much meaning for us.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.832
Do you show emotion, Spock?

39:15.631 --> 39:17.588
I deeply respect
what he has accomplished.

39:17.758 --> 39:21.174
Well, I hope he accomplishes
something here, and soon.

39:22.804 --> 39:24.180
Surak?

39:27.809 --> 39:30.479
Help me, Spock.

39:36.902 --> 39:38.444
Spock, help me.

39:38.778 --> 39:40.486
Mr. Spock.

39:40.655 --> 39:44.154
Your friend wants you.
He seems to be hurt.

39:44.325 --> 39:46.995
Spock. Help me, Spock.

39:47.704 --> 39:49.531
Spock.

39:49.831 --> 39:50.993
Help me.

39:52.125 --> 39:54.960
You can't let him suffer.

39:55.837 --> 39:58.541
They're trying to goad us
into attacking, captain.

39:58.715 --> 40:00.173
They expect us to act rashly.

40:00.341 --> 40:02.334
- Yes, I know that.
- Help me, Spock.

40:02.510 --> 40:05.131
He was aware of what might happen
when he went.

40:06.681 --> 40:10.346
- I should never have let him go.
- You had no choice, captain.

40:13.104 --> 40:14.764
You could not have stopped him.

40:14.939 --> 40:18.189
- How can you ignore that?
- A Vulcan would not cry out so.

40:21.237 --> 40:24.237
Whether he's a Vulcan or not,
he's in agony.

40:25.032 --> 40:30.073
- I am not insensitive to it, captain.
- Help me. Spock.

40:31.330 --> 40:34.864
But you can just listen to it
and do nothing.

40:36.793 --> 40:38.371
I can't.

40:38.545 --> 40:41.250
Captain,
that is what they're waiting for.

40:41.423 --> 40:44.175
They're waiting for us
to attempt a rescue.

40:45.594 --> 40:48.429
I can't just let him stay there.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.970
Perhaps we can rescue him,
Mr. Spock.

40:52.142 --> 40:54.847
I suggest
that we do whatever they want.

40:55.312 --> 40:56.889
Do what they want, sir?

40:57.147 --> 41:00.064
Not the way they want it, however.

41:00.233 --> 41:02.226
We must first convince them

41:02.402 --> 41:06.898
that they have provoked us
to recklessness.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.525
James, I do not mean to presume
upon your authority.

41:11.411 --> 41:14.577
What I propose
is that I circle around to their rear,

41:14.747 --> 41:17.285
while you two provide
a frontal assault.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.827
It should be sufficiently violent
to cover whatever I do.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.243
And what will you do?

41:22.838 --> 41:24.498
Why, slip into their camp
and free him.

41:25.341 --> 41:28.425
- No.
- James, James.

41:28.594 --> 41:30.254
Remember, I was something
of a backwoodsman.

41:30.429 --> 41:32.885
I doubt that you could do
what I was bred to.

41:33.057 --> 41:37.434
- I can't let you risk it, Mr. President.
- Well, I am no longer president.

41:37.686 --> 41:41.850
- Mr. Spock, any comment?
- Help me, Spock.

41:42.941 --> 41:45.230
- No, sir.
- One matter further, gentlemen.

41:45.402 --> 41:48.273
We fight on their level.

41:48.447 --> 41:53.689
With trickery, brutality, finality.
We match their evil.

41:57.622 --> 42:01.157
I know, James.
I was reputed to be a gentle man.

42:01.334 --> 42:03.244
But I was commander in chief

42:03.420 --> 42:06.955
during the four bloodiest years
of my country's history.

42:07.132 --> 42:09.587
I gave orders that sent

42:09.926 --> 42:14.422
100,000 men to their death
at the hands of their brothers.

42:17.308 --> 42:19.882
Now, there's no
honourable way to kill,

42:20.645 --> 42:21.760
no gentle way to destroy.

42:21.938 --> 42:24.393
There is nothing good in war
except its ending.

42:26.818 --> 42:29.522
And you are fighting
for the lives of your crew.

42:31.697 --> 42:35.031
Your campaign, Mr. President.

42:35.701 --> 42:37.908
They should be coming soon.

42:54.303 --> 42:56.426
Zora. Kahless.

42:57.306 --> 42:58.765
No, wait.

43:01.852 --> 43:03.679
- How many did you see?
- Two.

43:10.527 --> 43:12.021
Zora.

44:02.453 --> 44:04.196
Surak.

44:07.833 --> 44:09.411
Surak.

44:09.585 --> 44:11.992
The others have drawn them away.

44:12.921 --> 44:15.210
We will circle around.

44:16.091 --> 44:19.294
It was a worthy effort, Surak.
Worthy.

44:19.928 --> 44:23.344
No need to blame yourself
for its failure.

44:28.937 --> 44:30.479
Help me, Spock.

44:31.857 --> 44:34.478
Help me. Spock.

44:36.444 --> 44:38.152
Now can you cry like Lincoln?

44:38.321 --> 44:40.777
Help me, Kirk.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.656
Help me, Kirk.

44:54.128 --> 44:57.628
- Mr. Lincoln.
- James, stay back.

46:26.719 --> 46:28.925
You are the survivors.

46:29.096 --> 46:31.255
The others have run off.

46:31.432 --> 46:34.516
It would seem that evil retreats
when forcibly confronted.

46:34.935 --> 46:38.055
However, you have failed
to demonstrate to me

46:38.230 --> 46:41.065
any other difference
between your philosophies.

46:41.483 --> 46:43.523
Your good and your evil
use the same methods,

46:43.694 --> 46:46.101
achieve the same results.

46:46.738 --> 46:48.233
Do you have an explanation?

46:48.407 --> 46:51.076
You established the methods
and the goals.

46:51.243 --> 46:53.070
For you to use as you chose.

46:53.245 --> 46:54.704
What did you offer the others?

46:54.871 --> 46:57.789
What they wanted most. Power.

46:59.626 --> 47:01.417
You offered me

47:02.087 --> 47:03.629
the lives of my crew.

47:03.964 --> 47:06.040
I perceive.

47:06.216 --> 47:08.541
You have won their lives.

47:08.927 --> 47:11.085
How many others
have you done this to?

47:11.262 --> 47:14.548
What gives you the right
to hand out life and death?

47:14.724 --> 47:17.262
The same right
that brought you here.

47:17.435 --> 47:19.558
The need to know new things.

47:22.023 --> 47:25.807
- We came in peace.
- And you may go in peace.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.413
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

47:38.581 --> 47:40.704
Is that you, captain?
Are you all right?

47:41.125 --> 47:43.497
Yes, Mr. Sulu, we're all right.

47:43.669 --> 47:45.745
You may beam us aboard.

47:52.011 --> 47:53.042
Mr. Scott, report.

47:53.220 --> 47:54.928
The ship is functioning normally
again, sir,

47:55.097 --> 47:57.090
and the restart cycle is in operation.

47:57.266 --> 47:59.139
You'd never know
anything had been out of order.

47:59.309 --> 48:00.804
- I can't fathom it.
- Mr. Sulu.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.935
We should be on warp power
within 30 minutes, sir.

48:03.105 --> 48:04.729
- Good.
- Mr. Chekov.

48:04.898 --> 48:06.974
The deterioration in the shielding
has stopped, sir,

48:07.150 --> 48:09.060
and is reversing itself.
I have no explanation.

48:09.236 --> 48:11.275
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

48:13.448 --> 48:15.156
Mr. Spock.

48:15.534 --> 48:17.194
Any explanation?

48:17.369 --> 48:20.453
Conjecture, captain,
rather than explanation.

48:20.622 --> 48:22.282
- Well?
- It would seem that we were held

48:22.457 --> 48:25.541
in the power of creatures
able to control matter

48:25.710 --> 48:29.293
and to rearrange molecules
in whatever fashion was desired.

48:29.631 --> 48:33.415
So they were able to create images
of Surak and Lincoln

48:33.593 --> 48:35.301
after scanning our minds

48:35.470 --> 48:38.257
and using their fellow creatures
as source matter.

48:38.431 --> 48:40.009
They seemed so real.

48:40.183 --> 48:44.015
And to me, especially Mr. Lincoln.

48:45.062 --> 48:47.518
I feel I actually met Lincoln.

48:48.649 --> 48:51.816
Yes. And Surak.

48:51.986 --> 48:55.189
Perhaps, in a sense,
they were real, captain.

48:55.364 --> 48:57.487
Since they were created
out of our own thoughts,

48:57.658 --> 49:00.529
how could they be anything
but what we expected them to be?

49:00.703 --> 49:05.199
It was so hard for me
to see him die again.

49:05.833 --> 49:08.668
I feel I understand
what Earth must have gone through

49:08.836 --> 49:11.208
to achieve final peace.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.755
Captain Kirk,

49:12.923 --> 49:15.081
the planet has resumed
its normal appearance.

49:23.266 --> 49:27.763
There is still so much of their work
to be done in the galaxy, Spock.

49:28.980 --> 49:33.891
Mr. Sulu, break us out of orbit
and continue to our next assignment.

49:34.069 --> 49:35.729
Aye, aye, sir.

49:36.305 --> 49:42.857
