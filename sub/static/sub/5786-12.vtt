00:00.961 --> 00:02.629
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.837 --> 00:04.881
You're really plowing
through your list.

00:05.048 --> 00:08.009
<i>The media's calling you
the Chaos Killer.</i>

00:08.218 --> 00:10.679
It says here you were slinging
for Stacey Boss.

00:10.887 --> 00:12.222
<i>He's my star witness
against Mr. Boss.</i>

00:12.430 --> 00:13.807
<i>He's pretty much
the whole case.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.558
<i>He's dangerous,
stay away from him!</i>

00:15.767 --> 00:18.395
He tried to kill Major.
He turned me into a zombie.

00:18.603 --> 00:20.438
I slept with him.

00:20.647 --> 00:22.273
<i>You know,
you sleep with someone,</i>

00:22.482 --> 00:23.566
<i>you think you know.</i>

00:23.775 --> 00:24.901
<i>But they could be anybody.</i>

00:30.907 --> 00:32.325
Everything okay?

00:32.534 --> 00:34.160
Yeah.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.495
Just helping a friend.

00:37.414 --> 00:38.832
Sorry I took so long.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.875
Don't be sorry.

00:41.084 --> 00:44.129
Watching you crawl back
into bed is not a bad thing.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.306
You never told me
how you got this.

00:55.515 --> 00:57.058
That's a story for
another day.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.241
Sorry.
I lost track of time.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.076
Let me get off your bed.

01:15.285 --> 01:16.536
Just a few more days
until my new place is ready,

01:16.745 --> 01:17.954
and then I'll be
out of your way.

01:18.163 --> 01:20.373
Don't be silly, we love
having you here.

01:20.582 --> 01:22.667
Although, you do have a habit
of picking the marshmallows
out of my cereal,

01:22.876 --> 01:25.879
leaving me with
a less-than-ideal ratio of
marshmallow to crunchy bits,

01:26.087 --> 01:27.714
but, you know,
I'll let that slide...

01:30.341 --> 01:31.384
Oh, no, Peyton.

01:34.012 --> 01:35.013
What is it?

01:36.347 --> 01:38.349
I screwed up at work.

01:38.558 --> 01:40.310
Can I do anything?

01:40.518 --> 01:42.353
I mean, because if you want
me to pick

01:42.562 --> 01:45.565
every last marshmallow bear
out of that box for you...

01:45.774 --> 01:47.067
I'll do it.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.818
I think I need something
stronger.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.238
When I was in college,
I had this professor,

01:52.447 --> 01:54.240
and when he'd hand out
the Friday quiz,

01:54.449 --> 01:57.786
he'd say,
"Duck soup for you,
schweetheart."

01:57.994 --> 01:59.704
I think he thought it
was easier for me than
everyone else.

01:59.913 --> 02:02.082
But I was probably working
twice as hard.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.210
Yeah, before you moved in,
I just assumed you
were a femmebot

02:05.418 --> 02:07.504
that plugged into a charging
station at night.

02:07.712 --> 02:10.340
- Ah, I bust ass to make it
look like that.

02:10.548 --> 02:14.219
It turns out,
I fail just as epically
as I succeed.

02:14.427 --> 02:17.430
I don't know what
happened at work,
but I promise,

02:17.639 --> 02:20.433
the only opinion you need
to worry about is your own.

02:20.642 --> 02:22.143
That's a pretty low
opinion right now.

02:22.352 --> 02:25.939
Well, it shouldn't be.
You are formidable.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.857
I mean, you're clever
and disciplined.

02:28.066 --> 02:29.234
Hardly.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.152
Those are just the
top tier qualities.

02:31.361 --> 02:33.822
All right? You're also clearly
blessed with a hollow leg.

02:36.741 --> 02:37.909
On that note...

02:38.910 --> 02:40.703
No, no. Don't go.

02:40.912 --> 02:41.830
I must.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.498
I know how this turns out.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.708
It's like
the shots contest in
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

02:45.917 --> 02:47.961
You're Karen Allen and
I'm the fat Nepalese guy

02:48.169 --> 02:49.838
that ends up
under the table.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.757
Come on.
You can handle it.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.178
I ever tell you
about my first case?

03:01.266 --> 03:03.685
Any chance you can put
a little pep in your step?

03:03.893 --> 03:07.147
The violent soundscape
of nature is making
my ears bleed.

03:07.355 --> 03:11.234
Birds chirping,
leaves rustling,
gnats laying eggs.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.111
Never start a land war
in Asia.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.572
Don't go toe-to-toe with
Peyton Charles when
drinking is involved.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.407
- Why are we sprinting?
- Because I'm hungry.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.075
I haven't eaten
anything lately.

03:19.284 --> 03:21.202
I was afraid that
horny-librarian-brain

03:21.411 --> 03:22.745
would lead
to poor life choices.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.664
- And did it?
- Did it what?

03:24.873 --> 03:26.416
Lead to any poor life
choices?

03:26.624 --> 03:28.793
Liv, we're really going to
need your help with this one.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.587
Nasty triple homicide.

03:30.795 --> 03:32.505
Triple, you say?

03:32.714 --> 03:34.340
Detective Babineaux!
Any comment?

03:36.342 --> 03:38.011
Come on, Detective.
Give me something.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.722
Press is going to have
a field day with this case.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.807
Three unidentified males.

03:43.016 --> 03:45.226
Most likely killed on a boat,
then washed up here.

03:48.563 --> 03:50.732
Um, where are their heads?

03:50.940 --> 03:52.025
I was hoping you
could tell me.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.599
Cause of death might take
a while.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.517
Cause of death appears
obvious.

04:26.726 --> 04:28.978
The three victims were
decapitated post-mortem.

04:29.187 --> 04:30.688
Oh.

04:30.897 --> 04:33.316
The driver's licenses we found
on the bodies were fake.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.611
We can probably assume
the photos are real,
but the names are not.

04:36.819 --> 04:39.072
Hoping you can
work your magic, Liv,
help ID these guys.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.323
Uh...

04:40.531 --> 04:43.284
Looks like a no-brainer
to me, Liv.

04:43.493 --> 04:44.661
I'll let you know
when I get something.

04:44.869 --> 04:46.079
All right, the sooner
the better.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.919
Uh, what are you planning
to do about your little
vision predicament?

04:53.127 --> 04:54.796
I don't know.
I can't think when I'm hungry.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.506
Everything looks like
a cartoon sandwich.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.633
Olivia Moore!

04:58.841 --> 05:01.552
Let's see what's inside drawer
number one.

05:03.304 --> 05:07.100
Today we're sending you
home with Madison Brenneck,

05:07.308 --> 05:08.226
25 years old.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.940
The victim of an
ill-fated rendezvous
with a Seattle cross-town.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.984
Bus driver said she never
even looked up from her phone.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.611
She's only in our morgue
because she was killed
on city property.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.948
So, Madison comes
complete with wonderfully
unremarkable,

05:22.156 --> 05:23.408
non-murdery visions.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.076
All the great taste,
none of the foul play.

05:40.049 --> 05:43.761
Did you just post a
picture of what I assume
is Madison Brenneck

05:43.970 --> 05:46.597
wrapped in sushi rice on
your Instagram account?

05:46.806 --> 05:48.433
Hashtag "brain food"?

05:48.641 --> 05:51.936
'Course I 'grammed it,
that fish was on fleek.

05:52.145 --> 05:54.063
Oh, my God!
Why did I post that?

05:54.272 --> 05:56.274
Why does anyone post
pictures of food?

05:56.482 --> 05:58.151
I think it's okay.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.819
It just looks like
raw tuna.

06:00.028 --> 06:01.696
Look, so, I did some digging.

06:01.904 --> 06:05.325
Turns out our Madison
was quite the millennial
social media maven.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.744
Instagram, Facebook,
Tumblr.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.704
She had over 600 Yelp reviews.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.915
The day she died,
she tweeted 27 times.

06:13.124 --> 06:14.876
Liv, Liv.

06:15.084 --> 06:19.422
"Devoured tuna roll."
Hashtag "Sushi obsessed."

06:19.630 --> 06:21.341
Hashtag "Covering my ass."

06:21.549 --> 06:23.426
You need to be careful
not to overshare on
social media.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.137
Anything zombie-related
is TMI.

06:26.346 --> 06:29.140
Don't worry.
I'm on my chill hustle
hundo-p.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.392
My annoying millennial
speak knowledge ended
with TMI,

06:31.601 --> 06:33.227
so I have no idea what you
just said.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.357
Liv, I'm serious.
Be careful.

06:42.070 --> 06:44.697
"The struggle is real.
Props for the good looks.
Boom."

06:46.532 --> 06:47.825
<i>Ms. Charles?</i>

06:48.034 --> 06:49.369
<i>Mr. Deaux is still waiting
to see you.</i>

06:49.577 --> 06:50.953
Thanks Jane.
You can send him in.

06:57.377 --> 06:58.503
You had me out there
a long time.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.298
Jane and I really bonded.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.759
I think she's handling
the change with grace.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.094
What do you want?

07:06.302 --> 07:07.804
Look, I don't know what
those cops told you,

07:08.012 --> 07:11.974
but I had nothing to do with
those missing Seattleites.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.685
A couple of the Chaos Killer's
victims called my business?

07:14.894 --> 07:16.687
It doesn't mean anything.

07:16.896 --> 07:19.357
Yeah, it's true,
I didn't mention my dad
was a victim.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.983
We haven't spoken in years.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.194
I try to keep my info
dumps to the useful variety,

07:23.403 --> 07:26.280
stay away from the irrelevant
"daddy never loved me"
stories, you know?

07:30.243 --> 07:32.829
That's quite a drink you're
making there.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.997
It's for a friend.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.959
She's dropping by to celebrate
my big decision.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.128
I'm telling Baracus
everything.

07:40.336 --> 07:43.339
And since they don't hand out
gold stars for sleeping
with the CI's,

07:43.548 --> 07:44.715
I think I'm done here.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.759
Don't tank your career
because of me.

07:46.968 --> 07:49.053
You're too smart for that.
Come on.

07:49.262 --> 07:50.805
We're doing important work.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.850
I'm trying to wash
away some sins here.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.812
What happened the other
night, it meant something.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.065
It made me think that...

08:07.905 --> 08:11.325
Oh, hello, Liv.
You know my guest.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.327
He's the man who made you
what you are today.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.415
Worlds collide.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.667
I take it Peyton knows all
about Team Z.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.043
Nobody calls it that.

08:21.252 --> 08:23.296
Stop trying to make
Team Z a thing.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.840
Blaine thinks he and
I could have something
special.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.092
Aww, he swiped right.

08:28.301 --> 08:32.054
I'm sure that your Tinder
photo is hair-centric
and flattering,

08:32.263 --> 08:34.182
but how do you spin that bio?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.809
"I'm a humble guy,
always down for a hike,

08:37.018 --> 08:38.978
"or we could just murder
and chill.

08:39.187 --> 08:42.565
"My fave slays are astronauts,
homeless teens
and boyfriends."

08:42.773 --> 08:44.108
For the record,

08:45.067 --> 08:46.527
all you are to me

08:48.070 --> 08:49.489
is a giant mistake.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.959
Oh. Celebratory selfie!

09:02.168 --> 09:04.253
Oh, uh, okay.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.047
Still no word from
Mr. Baracus.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.049
I've been calling
him all day,

09:08.257 --> 09:09.884
but you know how he likes
to work with the music
cranked up.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.344
I'll swing by his house
on the way home.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.266
Did you just tweet
that photo of us?

09:17.475 --> 09:18.893
Hashtag "friendship goals."

09:19.101 --> 09:21.437
Hashtag "booty had me
like what"?

09:21.646 --> 09:22.813
Not cool?

09:23.022 --> 09:24.815
Uh, little weird.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.070
Good thing
you didn't get my
crime board in the shot.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.448
Hashtag "go into hiding
because we are onto you."

09:34.283 --> 09:37.245
You're going to have to
update your board, Peyton.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.997
Hal Connolly,
Kareem Jackson
and Willy Fisher

09:40.206 --> 09:42.250
washed up on the shore of
Lake Washington this morning.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.710
Without their heads.

10:37.972 --> 10:40.975
I know, Ma.
I'm listening and you're
absolutely right.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.311
If you're gonna host mahjong,
the other ladies should
step up

10:43.519 --> 10:44.604
and bring refreshments.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.358
Ma, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.989
Gotta hand it to Mr. Boss.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.075
According to Yelp,
he's a very committed CPA.

10:58.284 --> 10:59.660
Can I offer you a vatrushka?

10:59.869 --> 11:01.287
Come on.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.205
You've got a second
shot at life.

11:03.414 --> 11:04.457
Indulge.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.666
I'm good.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.002
Well, there's your problem.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.379
We wanted to know if you
recognized any of these men.

11:10.588 --> 11:11.922
You love showing me
pictures.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.259
No. I can't say that I do.

11:15.468 --> 11:16.636
Isn't that you?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.512
Standing with those
three guys?

11:18.721 --> 11:21.057
At the funeral of Louis
Brandt, AKA "Cock-Eyed Lou?"

11:21.265 --> 11:23.059
Oh, yeah, those guys.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.603
You run into so many people
at funerals.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.064
But isn't that guy with
the machete your nephew?

11:29.982 --> 11:31.442
Ah, so it is!

11:31.651 --> 11:33.986
He's an odd duck traipsing
around with that thing.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.323
The mustache is new.
Yeah. Have these boys done
something wrong?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.867
Probably, but we didn't
get a chance to ask.

11:40.076 --> 11:42.620
They washed up on the shore
of Lake Washington yesterday,

11:42.828 --> 11:43.996
missing their heads.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.293
I think we're done.

11:49.502 --> 11:51.253
I have to call my sister.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.631
Would you please
see yourselves out?

11:53.839 --> 11:55.091
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.762
I don't think he's our guy.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.139
He did seem pretty
rattled about his nephew.

12:02.348 --> 12:05.935
Could be someone with a
death wish wanted to send
Mr. Boss a serious message.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.145
And we just delivered it.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.064
You know, I know a guy.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.941
When I was in Vice,
I helped him out
of a couple of jams.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.068
Let's track him down,
have a little chat.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.278
Liv?

12:16.487 --> 12:18.739
What does it mean if a
guy you're dating isn't
on Facebook?

12:18.948 --> 12:21.742
- I don't use Facebook.
So, nothing?
- Hmm.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.577
Or maybe he's married
with a bunch of kids.

12:28.499 --> 12:29.917
How you been, Tanner?

12:30.126 --> 12:31.127
Got bedbugs.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.170
So that sucks.

12:33.379 --> 12:36.382
You look just like this doll
my little sister used to have.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.802
We just found a trio
of Mr. Boss's guys,
all decapitated.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.013
Got us wondering if there
was a new player out there
moving in on Boss.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.724
Above my pay grade, man.

12:46.684 --> 12:48.477
What's your Twitter handle,
Tanner?

12:48.686 --> 12:52.773
Hashtag "real CI's of
Seattle," hashtag "riding
the U-boat."

12:52.982 --> 12:55.151
Sally Tiny Tears is
freaking me out, man.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.027
I can't have people
thinking I'm tight with
cops.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.405
Then make it worth
her while not to post that.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.116
I believe she is what they
call "a taste maker".

13:02.324 --> 13:04.118
More of an online
influencer.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.205
Okay, yeah,
there's a new player.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.249
A mystery man
with a new product.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.375
Lucky U.

13:11.584 --> 13:12.960
It's the sickest Utopium
out there.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.212
Totally uncut, insane high.

13:15.421 --> 13:18.257
And cheap.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.137
The bunk I'm slinging's got
more steps than Helen Keller
in a corn maze.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.683
Tell me more about this
mystery man.

13:27.892 --> 13:30.019
It's like you don't know
what the word "mystery" means.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.315
<i>Hey, guys, Liv here.</i>

13:34.523 --> 13:37.443
<i>So, today I am beyond excited
to do an unboxing video</i>

13:37.651 --> 13:40.988
<i>of our latest haul
from MorgueTech.</i>

13:41.197 --> 13:44.617
<i>Lots of fun stuff
in here, brain pans,</i>

13:45.910 --> 13:48.037
<i>wrap-around cadaver
covers.</i>

13:48.245 --> 13:52.333
<i>These are awesome
because they come with
a super-cute document pouch.</i>

13:52.500 --> 13:56.295
A hundred and fifty-three
people watched you
unpack a box?

13:56.504 --> 13:59.215
How? Why?

13:59.423 --> 14:00.966
Please tell me you're not
watching your own vlog.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.887
What are you doing on
Seattle PD database?

14:05.095 --> 14:06.722
Looking for
background info on Drake.

14:06.931 --> 14:08.516
I feel like he might be
hiding something.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.893
What kind of person doesn't
use Twitter or Facebook?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.020
Only a lunatic.

14:13.229 --> 14:14.980
How else would he
disseminate inspirational
quotes and latte art?

14:16.357 --> 14:18.359
Never mind.
Figured it out.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.529
It's the kind of person
sentenced to 22 months
in Monroe Correctional

14:21.737 --> 14:23.656
for felony aggravated assault.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.243
"Victim suffered
an ocular fracture,
broken ribs, shattered femur."

14:27.952 --> 14:29.078
Oh, my God.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.875
It's him. What do I do?

14:35.084 --> 14:39.213
Well, he's a zombie with anger
issues and a prison record.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.842
As far as millennial breakup
options go, ghosting him
gets my vote.

14:45.261 --> 14:46.428
It's the smart move.

14:47.513 --> 14:48.931
But I like him, Ravi.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.689
You should eat.

14:58.816 --> 14:59.942
And sleep.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.113
Look at this.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.241
That is from the crime scene
at the McDonough estate,

15:07.449 --> 15:09.535
one of the Chaos Killer's
most recent victims.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.453
Pay attention
to the graffiti.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.623
Now, look at this.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.458
It's from the Baracus home.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.918
The graffiti is different.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.004
A lot about this crime
scene is different.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.131
Including the fact that
Baracus doesn't fit the
Chaos Killer's usual

15:22.339 --> 15:23.841
"one-percenter demo."

15:24.049 --> 15:26.135
I don't think
it's the same perp.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.388
Which makes sense because
we've had our friend Blaine
under surveillance,

15:29.597 --> 15:31.807
- so it wasn't him.
- Detective Babineaux?

15:32.016 --> 15:33.601
What you got on
the triple decapitation?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.394
People have a right
to know, et cetera, et cetera.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.771
- No comment.
- You're killing me.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.609
A triple beheading,
and the afternoon edition
still puts me below the fold?

15:41.817 --> 15:43.694
What's a guy gotta do
to get a lead story?

15:43.903 --> 15:45.821
Giving the killer a catchy
nickname probably helps.

15:51.619 --> 15:53.787
"Vaughn Douche Clark."

15:53.996 --> 15:55.623
So original.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.333
Here he comes.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.627
Major. Come on in.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.795
I was summoned.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.589
Okay, here we go.
Watch this.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.467
"Max Rager tastes like
the ass of a turtle

16:06.675 --> 16:08.469
"swimming in a dirty river."

16:08.677 --> 16:09.929
I don't know why he does
this to himself.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.390
Thank you, Sambulo21,
from Swaziland.

16:13.599 --> 16:17.728
Boy, I just love this guy's
comprehensive knowledge
of how turtle ass tastes.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.438
Thanks for dropping by, Major.

16:19.647 --> 16:21.815
You know our Security
Consultant, Janko?

16:22.024 --> 16:22.942
Haven't had the pleasure.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.401
Six years in Iraq.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.111
Oh. Thanks for your service.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.739
Well, he's a private
military contractor.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.324
Ah.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.284
He was in charge of
ass-kicking and name-taking,

16:32.493 --> 16:34.453
and really doesn't like it
when I brag about him,

16:34.662 --> 16:36.580
but he's such a good egg.

16:36.789 --> 16:38.374
Unlike these haters here.

16:38.582 --> 16:41.043
Max Rager has over three
million Twitter followers.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.503
Why obsess over the trolls?

16:42.670 --> 16:45.172
No troll left behind,
Rita, my dear.

16:45.381 --> 16:48.175
Nobody should slip
through the cracks.

16:48.384 --> 16:49.343
Isn't that right, Major?

16:50.427 --> 16:52.638
Yeah, I guess.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.183
So, why is it a man
you told me is not a zombie

16:56.392 --> 16:58.519
gets taken out by
the Chaos Killer?

16:58.727 --> 17:02.106
We're...
What's the word?

17:02.314 --> 17:03.899
Concerned.

17:04.108 --> 17:07.027
Okay, I mean, you're really
underselling it, but whatevs.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.447
So, the question is,

17:10.656 --> 17:12.574
what the hell is going
on here, Major?

17:20.833 --> 17:22.418
I'm as confused as anyone.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.336
I mean, it looks like someone
else wanted Baracus gone,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.672
and they stole my MO to do it.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.174
But I checked Baracus,
he wasn't a zombie.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.718
Interesting.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.720
Because his credit report
tells us otherwise.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.972
$700 at Spice Mountain,

17:35.180 --> 17:39.059
ghost pepper hot sauce
from India, weekly spray tans
and salon dye jobs.

17:39.268 --> 17:40.227
Suspicious,
don't you think?

17:41.395 --> 17:42.938
Sounds pretty undead to me.

17:43.147 --> 17:45.524
Or just as likely
metrosexual foodie.

17:45.733 --> 17:48.694
I'm going to be so upset
if you're not telling me
the truth.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.112
And I don't get mad, Major.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.739
You get even?

17:51.947 --> 17:54.199
Oh, God, no. No, no, no.
Where's the fun there? No.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.910
I get even with interest.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.122
I embrace the Chicago way.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.874
Someone pulls a knife,
I pull a gun.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.876
Someone sends one of mine
to the hospital,

18:04.084 --> 18:05.085
- I send...
- I got it.

18:05.294 --> 18:06.962
Do you got it, Major?
Do you?

18:07.171 --> 18:11.300
Don't just say the words.
Reflect on their meanings.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.677
Take these Internet
trolls, for instance,

18:13.886 --> 18:17.431
who say the most hurtful
things about this company,

18:17.639 --> 18:19.141
which I built
from the ground up.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.560
So, someone sends
a mean tweet, you...

18:21.769 --> 18:23.395
Don't know, yet.

18:23.604 --> 18:27.149
But there's definitely gonna
be some escalation.

18:27.357 --> 18:31.236
Hey, why don't we send him
some really embarrassing
magazine subscriptions, huh?

18:31.445 --> 18:34.239
<i>Chub Hub.
Or Bathhouse Monthly.</i>

18:34.448 --> 18:36.075
Or, wait. What's that really
freaky one you like?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.785
<i>Slow Torture and Gardens?</i>

18:39.745 --> 18:42.539
So, which one should we
go after first, Major? Huh?

18:42.748 --> 18:45.250
Which one of these
rat bastards gets his?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.127
Uh...

18:48.462 --> 18:50.297
Trickster107.

18:50.506 --> 18:54.843
Trickster107,
from Bangkok, who tweeted
to his 14 followers

18:55.052 --> 18:58.013
that he thinks our product
caused his father's
heart attack.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.892
Oh, game on, pal.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.524
Your shift is over.
Go.

19:08.732 --> 19:12.069
- Be free!
- Just one last thing.

19:12.277 --> 19:16.365
"Real talk? Your sandwich
artist was chugging some
serious haterade today.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.700
"No eye contact?
Am I a leper?

19:18.909 --> 19:20.577
"Also, where's the
made-from-scratch sriracha?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.455
"The artisanal pickles?"
One star.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.374
A bit harsh for Bernie's
Sub Shack, don't you think?

19:25.582 --> 19:26.708
We eat there twice a week.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.128
Hashtag "sorry, not sorry."

19:29.962 --> 19:30.921
Oh, hello there.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.339
What's up, Ravi? Liv.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.344
Uh, I'll just wander off
or something...

19:40.055 --> 19:42.307
Haven't heard from you.
What happened?

19:42.516 --> 19:45.561
Sex-starved-librarian
brain wear off and
you've lost interest?

19:45.769 --> 19:50.065
Oh, no, I've just had
a crazy day at work,
lots of murders.

19:50.274 --> 19:54.736
Yet you had time to
tweet 17 times today.

19:54.945 --> 19:57.281
"Pumpkin spice latte,
yay!

19:57.489 --> 20:01.451
"Stop lights, boo!
Wow, Seattle, cloudy much?"

20:01.660 --> 20:02.953
That's a lot of time
reading tweets

20:03.162 --> 20:05.789
for a guy who claims
he doesn't use Twitter,

20:05.998 --> 20:08.458
or who spent two years
in prison.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.004
That...

20:12.212 --> 20:13.255
Doing a little digging, huh?

20:13.463 --> 20:15.048
Do I get to explain
myself,

20:15.257 --> 20:17.259
or do you think you know
everything you need
to know about me?

20:17.467 --> 20:20.012
I don't know anything.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.932
My dad split,
my mom had a string
of loser boyfriends.

20:24.141 --> 20:26.101
The worst was this mean
drunk named Frank.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.730
So, I'm 19.

20:29.938 --> 20:34.902
I come home and my mom's eye
is swollen shut.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.070
Blood down
the front of her shirt.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.907
Frank's just sitting in front
of the TV with his hands
in his shorts,

20:40.115 --> 20:43.202
calling out for another beer
like nothing happened.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.871
And I just snapped.
Went after him.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.498
He pulled a knife,
that's how I got this.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.336
The prosecutor said
I went a bit overboard,

20:52.544 --> 20:54.588
because Frank
still can't walk.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.758
Or feed himself.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.594
I'm glad you told me.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.138
Well, I usually wait until
date five or six to spring

21:03.347 --> 21:05.432
the whole ex-con thing
on a girl.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.768
So, give me another shot?

21:07.935 --> 21:09.478
Let me take you to dinner.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.397
I'd like that.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.235
Hold on.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.278
I am so sorry,
can we reschedule?

21:18.487 --> 21:19.821
My mom's kitchen sink
is leaking.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.823
Which I know doesn't
sound like an emergency,

21:22.032 --> 21:24.284
but if I don't handle it,
she'll call 911.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.954
BuzzFeed teaches us
that when a man abruptly
change his plans,

21:27.162 --> 21:29.039
it means he's up to no good.

21:29.248 --> 21:32.459
I'm happy for you to join me,
but my mom, she's a bit
of a trip.

21:33.252 --> 21:34.503
I can handle it.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.760
What's going on
with your skin there?

21:41.969 --> 21:44.846
Anemia or some kind
of sun allergy?

21:45.055 --> 21:46.515
Ma!
What did we talk about?

21:46.723 --> 21:48.684
Roll it around inside
your head first, test it out.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.103
I'm fine.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.190
She's got the coloring
of a paper towel,

21:55.399 --> 21:57.109
but I'm not supposed
to say anything.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.860
I'm sorry.

21:59.069 --> 22:02.197
She tends to say the first
thing that pops into her head.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.449
Hey, you know what?

22:04.658 --> 22:07.744
I took a couple of cosmetology
classes at the community
college.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.288
I could give you
a little makeover!

22:09.496 --> 22:11.206
She's beautiful, Ma!

22:11.415 --> 22:14.459
Yeah, so is the sun,
but you can't stare
directly at it.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.919
What do you say?

22:16.128 --> 22:17.087
Why not?

22:17.296 --> 22:18.547
Oh, good!

22:18.755 --> 22:19.923
Listen, let me go get
my makeup caboodle,

22:20.132 --> 22:21.341
and I'll be back in a jiffy!

22:25.304 --> 22:27.097
If I were you,
I'd make a run for it.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.435
We'll be starting
the service in
just a few minutes.

22:31.643 --> 22:34.104
I'd like to invite you to make
your way into the chapel.

22:35.564 --> 22:37.983
Excuse me,
we'll be starting...

22:38.734 --> 22:39.985
The, uh...

22:41.028 --> 22:42.362
We'll be doing the, um...

22:42.571 --> 22:43.947
Service?

22:44.156 --> 22:45.782
Yes, thank you.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.701
The service.
In the chapel.

22:47.909 --> 22:48.952
Thank you.

22:52.539 --> 22:56.293
Okay, press your tongues
to the roof of your mouths.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.170
You know, we don't want
any waddles.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.213
And smile.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.258
Good!

23:03.467 --> 23:04.926
If you post that,
you have to tag me in it.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.054
I don't know what that
means, honey.

23:07.262 --> 23:10.682
Uh, let me see if I can find
Nutterbutter, get a pic
with him, too,

23:10.891 --> 23:12.517
for next year's
Christmas card.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.728
Ma, we're not taking
a picture with the cat.
We gotta get going.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.272
But thank you again
for the sweater. I love it.

23:17.481 --> 23:20.650
Well, listen, before you go,
I want to give you
those vouchers

23:20.859 --> 23:23.487
for the Wicked Winter
Renaissance Faire! Huh?

23:25.697 --> 23:26.907
All right, where to
for dinner?

23:28.158 --> 23:30.369
Somewhere dark.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.296
Mozart?

23:45.717 --> 23:46.802
Debussy.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.136
So close.

23:49.554 --> 23:50.555
Come on, Blaine.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.391
Don't look so surprised.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.892
I never forget a face.

24:03.068 --> 24:05.237
I'm surprised you
remember me.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.156
The owner of a major league
team usually doesn't
remember the batboy.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.908
The good owners do.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.035
And you were more
than a batboy.

24:12.244 --> 24:16.164
You were an intriguing
AA prospect likely
to play in the bigs.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.833
Had I known.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.668
But it looks like you've
done well for yourself here.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.670
This place must've cost
a pretty penny.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.339
Who prepares your taxes?

24:25.173 --> 24:26.466
I've got a guy.

24:26.675 --> 24:27.759
Oh, a guy.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.302
I hear he's good.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.179
You know, as a small
business owner yourself,

24:31.388 --> 24:34.391
you probably know when
an employee leaves his job,

24:34.599 --> 24:37.227
two weeks' notice is standard.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.354
About that, um...

24:39.563 --> 24:42.149
I saw things at that
boat party.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.733
Things that still haunt me.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.527
I spent a couple weeks
shivering in a dark room,

24:45.735 --> 24:47.988
and I decided it was a sign
that I needed a change.

24:48.155 --> 24:50.157
A sign, huh?

24:50.365 --> 24:52.826
You think God was so desperate
for you to change your ways

24:53.034 --> 24:55.662
that he slaughtered all
those innocent people
to make a point?

24:55.871 --> 24:57.497
Well, we're talking about
the same guy that thought

24:57.706 --> 25:00.083
Noah's Ark
was a solid plan, so...

25:00.292 --> 25:04.337
Given the circumstances,
I'm inclined to let the lack
of proper notice slide.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.756
Thank you?

25:06.965 --> 25:10.385
But when you left
my employ, you had
in your possession

25:10.594 --> 25:12.846
$4,000 worth of product.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.139
That sounds about right.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.267
- Let me get my checkbook.
- Hold on.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.771
The, uh, calculator app
on this thing...

25:21.980 --> 25:23.815
How did we function before?

25:24.024 --> 25:28.612
Uh, 4K, plus the vig,
calculated weekly.

25:29.613 --> 25:31.573
We'll round to 100 weeks.

25:31.781 --> 25:34.701
Which means
you owe me just north
of 80 grand.

25:35.827 --> 25:39.122
But let's say 5K
every two weeks?

25:39.331 --> 25:40.832
I'll send my boys over
to collect.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.584
That sounds fair.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.461
I should be getting
back to my nephew's
service.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.130
You done good, kid.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.733
Shh.

26:06.942 --> 26:09.528
Is your breakfast not
using its indoor voice?

26:09.736 --> 26:11.238
Snap, crackle, pop.

26:11.446 --> 26:12.906
So loud.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.617
Drinking on a school night
again with Peyton.

26:15.825 --> 26:19.412
You're a disgrace to your
country's proud history
of functional lushes.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.122
Break in the case.

26:21.331 --> 26:23.458
Got a call from the owner
of a local marina.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.710
A strange boat was
docked there.

26:25.919 --> 26:28.838
He pulled up the cover,
and the inside of the boat was
drenched in blood.

26:29.047 --> 26:32.259
I'm guessing that's where
our vics and their heads
parted ways.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.593
Lucky them.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.428
Dope.
Let's dip up out of here.

26:41.518 --> 26:44.271
Customer that rents
this slip was having
his boat repaired.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.190
Showed up today to dock it,
and found this one
in his space.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.235
Me and my son pulled
the tarp off, and yowzah.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.820
But you didn't see who
docked the boat?

26:52.028 --> 26:53.780
No, my son was working
that day.

26:55.365 --> 26:56.741
Charlie!

26:56.950 --> 26:58.493
Hey! I'm about to dump
that thing in the lake.

26:58.702 --> 26:59.911
Huh?

27:00.120 --> 27:01.329
Kids and their phones.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.831
You'll understand what I mean
some day.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.958
No, I think I get it now.

27:05.166 --> 27:09.087
Charlie, you remember
anything about the guy
who docked this boat?

27:09.296 --> 27:11.673
I didn't get a good look
at him, but I saw him
get in a taxi.

27:11.881 --> 27:12.966
You know which
taxi company?

27:15.927 --> 27:17.387
Charlie! Answer the man!

27:17.596 --> 27:19.431
Dad, God!
It was green and white.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.017
I was googling "green
and white Seattle taxis"
to see which...

27:22.225 --> 27:24.019
That's Supreme Taxi.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.979
I'll get ahold
of the dispatcher.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.733
No way.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.276
Guess whose cabin this is.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.905
District Attorney
Floyd Baracus.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.246
Still warm.

27:45.332 --> 27:46.666
Baracus was here recently.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.003
Dale was right.

27:50.211 --> 27:53.006
The Baracus abduction wasn't
the Chaos Killer.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.217
It was Boss's goons trying
to make it look like
the Chaos Killer.

27:56.426 --> 28:00.430
I'm assuming Boss sent them
to thank Baracus in person
for all those indictments.

28:00.639 --> 28:02.390
But I just don't get it.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.643
How does a middle-aged
lawyer take out three
armed hitmen?

28:08.813 --> 28:09.814
What do you see?

28:10.023 --> 28:11.066
What?

28:11.274 --> 28:12.692
You were having a vision,
right?

28:12.901 --> 28:15.779
No, God, sorry.
I, uh, spaced out.

28:15.987 --> 28:18.156
No visions?

28:18.365 --> 28:20.450
I think the radiation from
your cell phone is giving
your third eye cataracts.

28:20.659 --> 28:21.993
Don't hate 'cause
you can't relate.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.297
How's this for a vision?

28:40.637 --> 28:42.597
I guess the man
of the hour didn't stick
around to explain himself.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.974
Searched the property.
No sign of Baracus.

28:45.183 --> 28:48.103
But a neighbor told us the
motorcycle that's usually
parked out front is gone.

28:48.311 --> 28:50.355
Run down the plate
and put out an APB.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.481
Yes, sir.

28:53.942 --> 28:58.196
<i>A zombie wouldn't
leave behind his only
food supply.</i>

28:58.405 --> 29:01.700
<i>Those brains are the DA's
incentive to find a very
good hiding spot.</i>

29:10.709 --> 29:11.835
Baracus?

29:12.919 --> 29:15.046
Hey!
Everything okay?

29:15.255 --> 29:17.132
Seattle's missing
district attorney
is a zombie,

29:17.340 --> 29:20.635
and he's currently hiding out
in the crawlspace under
his cabin.

29:20.844 --> 29:22.178
Can I take this?

29:22.387 --> 29:23.930
I believe you just did.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.390
Oh, wait. I thought he was
abducted by the Chaos Killer.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.475
No.
Three of Mr. Boss' hitmen.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.019
They did up his place
Chaos Killer-style.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.563
Big mistake abducting
a zombie.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.690
We just found their heads
in Baracus' fridge.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.692
I'm going to take the
poor guy some brains.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.652
See if I can figure out a way
to help him out of this
mess.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.112
I'll go with you.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.530
Thanks, but I got this.

29:40.739 --> 29:42.449
Liv. Think about it.

29:42.657 --> 29:43.742
You're going to a cabin
where there's a desperate
zombie

29:43.950 --> 29:44.951
who just decapitated
three men?

29:45.118 --> 29:46.327
It's not safe.

29:46.536 --> 29:48.163
It's not safe
for a non-zombie.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.255
Floyd?

29:58.339 --> 29:59.632
I brought brains.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.765
Hi.
I'm Olivia Moore.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.225
We've actually met before,
I'm Peyton Charles'
best friend.

30:11.770 --> 30:12.937
How did you know?

30:14.606 --> 30:17.025
About me. What I am.

30:17.233 --> 30:21.905
You have 40 varieties
of hot sauce and three
heads in the fridge.

30:22.113 --> 30:25.074
I snapped their necks
like it was nothing.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.327
I knew I was going to need
those brains,

30:29.287 --> 30:32.499
and one of them
had a machete, so...

30:32.707 --> 30:34.501
Three heads
in the refrigerator.

30:34.709 --> 30:35.960
I can't resurface after this.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.589
I'm an undead man
walking.

30:39.798 --> 30:43.009
Either Mr. Boss or the police
will find me.

30:43.218 --> 30:47.889
And I don't see any scenario
where I ever get to see
my son again.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.349
We'll figure something out.

30:57.732 --> 31:01.611
Man, you work up the nerve
to resign, and your boss
gets abducted.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.947
Bananas! I'm...
I'm still quitting though.

31:04.155 --> 31:07.033
Well, no sense in moving until
your employment's sorted.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.410
You don't mind me staying
in your hair a little longer?

31:09.619 --> 31:13.206
I do mind. Yeah, you know...
But Nietzsche taught us that
to live is to suffer.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.209
Mmm. Drink!

31:16.417 --> 31:18.211
We're drinking every time
one of the <i>Zombie High</i>
kids screams.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.380
Oh, I've seen the show.
I'm not sure that's
the best...

31:20.588 --> 31:21.798
Look, I know one thing.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.424
If I ever was turned
into a zombie,

31:23.633 --> 31:25.385
my first order of business
would be to scratch you.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.470
I'd be like,
"Oh, man! I'm a zombie."

31:27.679 --> 31:28.847
Scratch!

31:29.055 --> 31:30.974
Seems a little self-serving,
but okay.

31:31.182 --> 31:34.060
No way am I doing this whole
zombie thing without you.

31:34.269 --> 31:35.895
Drink!

31:36.813 --> 31:38.481
Mmm!

31:38.690 --> 31:40.149
<i>Like I told you,</i>

31:40.358 --> 31:42.443
<i>when you're playing
drinking games with Peyton,</i>

31:42.652 --> 31:44.362
<i>all you'll walk away with
is a "thanks for
participating" ribbon.</i>

31:44.571 --> 31:48.032
A tiny man with a
jackhammer has taken up
residence in my skull.

31:48.241 --> 31:52.120
And yet, I'll bet Peyton
still made it to 6:00 a.m.
spin class, didn't she?

31:52.328 --> 31:55.248
Big deal. I've been
spinning since 4:30.

31:55.456 --> 31:58.251
After seeing Baracus,
I'm worried Mr. Boss'll
come after Peyton next.

31:58.459 --> 32:00.253
No, that's problem solved.

32:00.461 --> 32:03.172
Peyton emailed a letter
of resignation to
the Mayor last night.

32:03.381 --> 32:04.924
I feel so bad for her.

32:05.133 --> 32:07.260
This is everything
she's worked for,
but it's probably best.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.680
If you saw Baracus,
that is one zombie
with no good options.

32:12.015 --> 32:14.434
Whoa!
Morning, stranger.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.644
Yeah, guess I'm the one
who hasn't been around
much lately.

32:16.853 --> 32:18.438
New guy.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.898
Rent check's on the table.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.357
I'll see you when
I need more clothes.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.908
Oh, I'm going to need more
of these boxes, a couple
more at least, thanks.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.537
Mayor Davis.

32:36.331 --> 32:37.290
No.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.250
No, what?

32:39.459 --> 32:42.545
No, I do not accept
your resignation.

32:42.754 --> 32:45.131
You see the front page
of the <i>Observer</i> today?

32:45.298 --> 32:48.635
This. This headline means you
can't resign.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.554
This headline means we have to
take down Mr. Boss.

32:51.763 --> 32:54.724
If we don't,
it means he owns Seattle.

32:54.933 --> 32:56.684
It means the bad guys win.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.770
Now, never mind
that it says that a
young woman of talent

32:58.978 --> 33:00.855
got out when
things went south.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.358
Are you the woman I think
you are, Peyton Charles?

33:09.030 --> 33:12.033
<i>♪ Nice girls
Not one with a defect</i>

33:12.241 --> 33:16.037
<i>♪ Cellophane shrink-wrapped
So correct ♪</i>

33:17.413 --> 33:19.666
Nice hearse.
It's real inconspicuous.

33:19.874 --> 33:21.250
It was either this
or the Zamboni.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.547
For services rendered.

33:26.756 --> 33:28.091
You catch the Mayor's
press conference?

33:28.299 --> 33:29.509
She's going hard
at Mr. Boss.

33:29.717 --> 33:30.802
You got exactly
what you wanted.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.303
Thus the brains.

33:32.512 --> 33:34.013
I risked a 20-year
career running that story.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.557
I invented sources,
I pulled quotes out of my ass.

33:36.766 --> 33:38.226
If it helps you sleep,

33:38.434 --> 33:39.560
every word was true.

33:43.523 --> 33:49.570
So, a doughy
40-something man

33:49.779 --> 33:53.116
gets abducted by a trio
of experienced killers.

33:53.324 --> 33:57.912
He's taken aboard a boat
where he's supposed
to meet his fate.

33:58.121 --> 34:01.624
What should happen
in this situation?

34:01.833 --> 34:02.875
Hmm? Nothing?

34:04.168 --> 34:05.253
I know!

34:05.461 --> 34:07.922
Doughy 40-something man

34:08.131 --> 34:10.508
is supposed to end up dead.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.468
The three experienced killers

34:12.677 --> 34:14.387
do not get beheaded.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.558
- Unless...
- I know this one, too!

34:18.725 --> 34:20.601
He's a zombie.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.353
But that should
not be possible,

34:22.562 --> 34:25.606
because our zombie
hunter swore to me

34:25.815 --> 34:28.484
that the District Attorney
walked among the living.

34:28.693 --> 34:33.281
And now I don't know
what to believe.

34:33.489 --> 34:37.827
How many zombies
have slipped through
the cracks?

34:38.036 --> 34:42.206
Should I have Janko here
go through the list
with much less discretion?

34:44.834 --> 34:47.336
The night I zombie-checked
Baracus,

34:47.545 --> 34:49.922
his kid came running up
to him,

34:50.131 --> 34:53.134
this five-year-old boy
throwing his arms around
his dad.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.846
And I couldn't. I couldn't
take him from his kid.

34:59.182 --> 35:02.977
But that is the only time
I have ever skipped a zombie.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.312
You have my word.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.939
You do respect me, Major,
don't you?

35:07.273 --> 35:08.232
Of course.

35:08.441 --> 35:09.609
And you are aware that

35:09.817 --> 35:11.611
when I want something
to happen, it...

35:11.819 --> 35:13.112
It generally happens.

35:14.363 --> 35:15.865
I don't doubt that.

35:16.074 --> 35:19.160
Well, why don't we
check in on your friend
in Bangkok?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.412
Trickster107.
The one you hand-picked.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.331
Let's see what he's
been up to.

35:23.539 --> 35:26.542
Okay, what file
am I looking at here?

35:26.751 --> 35:29.796
- YouTube, watch history.
- Okay, here we are.

35:30.004 --> 35:30.922
And...

35:32.632 --> 35:35.510
Oh... Ah! Oh. Oh.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.848
Looks like he's had
something of a bad day.

35:41.057 --> 35:44.268
Yeah, that's Thai for
"pool of his own blood."

35:44.477 --> 35:45.812
Yeah. I don't think he's going
to be thumbing through

35:46.020 --> 35:48.272
any of those
magazine subscriptions.

35:48.481 --> 35:51.943
Wonder if he had any
adorable rugrats.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.404
Max Rager is a global
brand, Major.

35:55.613 --> 35:57.198
We are everywhere.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.908
Like Starbucks.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.702
Or the Eye of Sauron.

36:01.911 --> 36:04.831
Tell you what,
I can tell you're not
comfortable with taking lives,

36:05.039 --> 36:07.250
so I'm going to make
things easier for you.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.752
You can save them instead.

36:09.961 --> 36:13.756
Each day, one of those rat
bastards trolling us is going
to have a similar accident

36:13.965 --> 36:20.012
until I get proof that you've
sent Floyd Baracus to his
watery grave.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.806
Oh, yeah. We know.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.560
So, it's time to play
whack-a-zombie.

36:25.768 --> 36:29.939
But if you're not sure
which hole Baracus is in,
ask Liv Moore.

36:31.983 --> 36:33.234
We know she knows.

38:21.384 --> 38:22.885
Hey!
What have you got for us?

38:23.094 --> 38:24.929
Twenty-two-year-old male
corner boy.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.889
Executed for selling on
the wrong corner.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.434
Throat slip.
A Mr. Boss special.

38:31.602 --> 38:32.812
Pocketful of Utopium.

38:33.896 --> 38:35.690
This must be Lucky U.

38:35.898 --> 38:37.858
Sold by
Mr. Boss' competition.

38:38.067 --> 38:41.821
What dumbass thought
that moving in on
Mr. Boss would be a good idea?

38:43.572 --> 38:44.573
Clive?

38:46.617 --> 38:48.119
Something wrong?

38:48.327 --> 38:51.038
Last night, Floyd Baracus
took his own life.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.291
Jumped off the Aurora Bridge.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.168
Left his shoes, wallet
and a suicide note.
I thought you'd want to know.

38:56.377 --> 38:57.837
What did the note say?

38:58.045 --> 38:59.755
Mainly a bunch of sweet
stuff to his son.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.341
"I'll see you again someday."
That sort of thing.

39:02.550 --> 39:05.720
We're gonna drag the lake,
but as of now, the case is
officially closed.

39:14.937 --> 39:17.648
Uh... You're packed up.

39:17.857 --> 39:19.859
Yeah, I decided not to
quit my job.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.569
I wish you would.

39:23.112 --> 39:25.239
Uh...

39:25.448 --> 39:28.326
I just stood next to parents
who came in to identify
their 22-year-old son.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.537
All right? Stacey Boss
didn't slit the kid's throat,

39:31.746 --> 39:33.122
but he might as well have.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.791
He's already gone after
one district attorney.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.127
Let somebody I'm less fond
of risk his life.

39:38.336 --> 39:40.338
And if I do that,
what does it make me?

39:41.213 --> 39:42.798
All right, fine.

39:43.007 --> 39:44.133
You've got the right stuff.

39:44.342 --> 39:45.676
But stay here.

39:45.885 --> 39:47.511
You know, you'll have two men
living with you,

39:47.720 --> 39:49.138
one's practically a Greek god,

39:49.347 --> 39:51.974
who's turned his body
into a finely-tuned weapon,

39:52.183 --> 39:54.518
and, of course, Major.

39:54.727 --> 39:57.188
And either of us would do
anything for you.

39:57.396 --> 40:01.442
My new place has a 24-hour
doorman and a hot tub.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.944
The Major will serve
as our doorman.

40:04.153 --> 40:05.821
All right? He's great
with doors.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.656
The opening.
The closing.

40:07.865 --> 40:09.617
And I will make sure
that your tub time's
hot as hell.

40:10.493 --> 40:11.452
Mmm...

40:14.705 --> 40:16.457
You're the best.

40:16.665 --> 40:21.379
You know, for the record,
I'd be very sad
to see you go.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.672
My liver, on the other hand,
is like, "Good riddance."

40:25.716 --> 40:28.052
- Uh, do you need help
with the...
- No. No.

40:29.762 --> 40:30.930
Thanks, Ravi.

40:31.806 --> 40:32.807
For everything.

40:33.766 --> 40:34.767
Uh...

41:06.132 --> 41:09.468
- Aw, crap.
- Flip it, flip it, flip it!

41:11.637 --> 41:12.763
You expecting someone?

41:12.972 --> 41:13.889
No.

41:21.814 --> 41:22.982
Yo, my boy here?

41:25.734 --> 41:27.445
This is the Lucky U?

41:27.653 --> 41:28.946
That's all we carry,
honey.

41:31.615 --> 41:32.950
Don E.
You don't show up here.

41:33.159 --> 41:34.076
Then don't ignore my texts.

41:34.285 --> 41:37.496
Some people don't have
the common courtesy to die
during business hours.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.165
- We gotta roll.
- I'm sorry.

41:39.373 --> 41:40.583
I'll be back as soon as I can.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.178
Blaine is the new player.
