03:56.636 --> 03:58.445
Man's voice: When Communism fell
in Eastern Europe,

03:58.471 --> 04:00.348
law and order broke down.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.853
Organized crime rose in its place-

04:02.875 --> 04:05.515
not that it wasn't there before.

04:05.545 --> 04:08.116
But after that,
it became open season,

04:08.147 --> 04:11.458
everyone looking for a fistful of Euros,
myself included.

04:12.785 --> 04:17.029
When one mob family has a problem
with another, they call me.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.195
For the right price, I solve it.

04:19.225 --> 04:22.399
I'm a fixer.
That's what I do.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.533
But that's not the only reason
I'm here.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.807
Hey, man.
It's been a while, Demyan.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.477
What's up, brother?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.750
- Liev, good to see you. I'm fine.
- Vlad is waiting for you upstairs.

05:53.453 --> 05:57.333
( Phone ringing )

05:57.357 --> 05:59.963
- Man: Hello?
- Yes, Nicholi. Yes.

05:59.992 --> 06:01.835
We're ready on our end.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.239
Everything is in place
and ready for the shipment.

06:04.263 --> 06:08.712
Perfect. We'll be ready to deliver it
within the next 43 hours.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.186
What can I say, Vlad?
It's been a pleasure.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.090
I'll call you after it's arrived.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.691
(Vlad chuckling)

06:29.722 --> 06:31.724
Welcome back, my friend.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.369
It's good to be back, Vlad.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.172
You were away too goddamn long,
you know that?

06:39.198 --> 06:41.007
I had to drink alone.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.479
I am sure
this was no problem for you.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.607
- Eh?

06:44.637 --> 06:46.938
- Let's drink together.
- Come on.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.561
Thank you, Nadia.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.240
So, tell me about Grozny.

07:44.297 --> 07:48.177
This deal, it went well.
Because they're looking after our interest.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.580
I figured as much,
but I meant tell me about the city.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.279
I have heard they almost rebuilt it now
brick for brick.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.754
It's still Grozny.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.518
Remember Sergei?

07:59.545 --> 08:04.460
He shot that bitch
just for scuffing his boot.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.555
He was a crazy bastard.

08:07.954 --> 08:11.697
So many of our brothers
died in Chechnya.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.410
To Sergei.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.573
- To Sergei.
-( glasses clink)

08:26.906 --> 08:30.353
You know, someone
should go back there

08:30.376 --> 08:33.152
and knock it down again
for old times' sake.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.455
Vlad,

08:35.481 --> 08:37.893
the war is long over, hmm?

08:37.917 --> 08:41.990
Not in here it isn't.
Not for me.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.126
- Vlad?
- I'm busy.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.158
It's Mikhail Suverov.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.006
Mikhail, good to hear from you.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.503
We drew lines in the sand,
you and I.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.175
You've wiped them clean.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.654
What are you talking about?

09:06.679 --> 09:11.560
You're doing business with Nicholi Dvorak
without my green light.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.359
Bullshit.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.525
Who the hell told you this?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.434
Someone who knew.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.995
Look, I don't know
who this man is,

09:22.028 --> 09:24.201
but whoever it is,
he's lying to you.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.301
He's trying to turn us
against each other.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.437
The problem I have with that

09:28.467 --> 09:32.176
is that his is not the only mouth
I've heard this from.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.276
You know how it goes-
you hear things so many times,

09:35.308 --> 09:37.811
there's maybe probably
some truth to it.

09:38.878 --> 09:43.293
It's not what you think.
Nicholi, he came to us.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.389
(chuckling )
Of course he did, my friend.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.835
You're trying to take my business
from beneath me.

09:51.857 --> 09:55.134
You're undercutting me
by five points.

09:55.161 --> 09:59.303
You killed three years
of peace between us

09:59.332 --> 10:01.369
for a handful of silver, Vlad.

10:01.400 --> 10:06.213
And I have just killed you.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.184
No, wait--

10:43.209 --> 10:44.210
(screaming )

11:13.806 --> 11:14.910
(cocking 9'-I")

11:15.908 --> 11:18.616
Vlad? Demyan?
Talk to me.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.056
We are pinned down.
He's got a gunman with .50 cal

11:21.080 --> 11:24.186
across the street,
shooting through a window.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.992
When you find him,
you murder the son of a bitch.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.498
( Crashes )

11:29.822 --> 11:31.563
Across the street.
Go, go.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.763
(gunfire)

11:41.367 --> 11:44.678
-( Nadia screams)
- Ah!

11:58.150 --> 12:00.096
- Come on!
- Ah!

12:00.119 --> 12:02.156
- Come on!
- No, no!

12:11.130 --> 12:12.438
Shit.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.945
( Nadia whimpering )

12:21.207 --> 12:24.814
( Nadia whimpers, screams)

12:58.677 --> 13:00.247
(chains creak)

13:04.817 --> 13:06.125
Is he done?

13:14.393 --> 13:16.430
Get rid of that.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.742
What are you waiting for?
Get rid of it.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.213
And make sure he disappears.
We don't want any combat.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.893
Hey, you, stop!

13:43.589 --> 13:45.535
I said stop!

13:48.994 --> 13:51.474
Turn the fuck around.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.035
I said turn around!

14:02.007 --> 14:03.418
(gunfire pops)

15:43.542 --> 15:46.546
(siren wails)

16:02.828 --> 16:04.671
( keys jangle)

16:32.458 --> 16:36.702
Fixer's voice: There are those who say
it's a blessing to know who you are,

16:36.729 --> 16:40.142
what you've been destined
to do in life.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.736
But to me
it's more like a curse.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.648
How did I end up here?

16:48.674 --> 16:52.053
A series of random events, fate.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.581
It's hard to tell anymore.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.322
But here I am.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.523
The money's good,

17:00.552 --> 17:02.554
but you still pay a price.

17:16.234 --> 17:19.682
(faint chanting)

17:27.479 --> 17:30.085
(chanting continues)

17:58.877 --> 18:01.551
(alarm beeping )

18:09.021 --> 18:10.728
( beeping stops )

18:20.299 --> 18:24.213
( muttering )

18:49.228 --> 18:52.072
Fixer's voice:
Isaiah 43:13--

18:52.097 --> 18:56.102
"Forget the former things;
do not dwell in the past."

18:57.102 --> 18:59.480
If there's one thing in life
I know that's true,

18:59.505 --> 19:01.507
it's that the past is the devil.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.919
You can't run from it.
It's always behind you.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.346
- Hey.
- Ciao.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.129
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Janice.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.080
Yes, it arrives tomorrow.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.682
( Chuckles )
Me as well, my friend.

21:21.713 --> 21:24.660
I'll call you with an update
as soon as I know more.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.560
Speak then.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.195
Bobby.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.033
- How'd it go?
- Good.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.906
He's chomping at the bit
to get the cargo.

21:39.931 --> 21:43.208
- Hmm. Has it left Damascus yet?
- No.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.647
It only left Astrakhan
an hour ago.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.550
It should be there
about three and a half hours.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.950
And the turnaround?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.182
It should hit Colombia
by late tomorrow evening.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.157
Say two hours
for offload, reload, refuel,

21:55.180 --> 21:57.922
and then another 23 hours
back again.

21:57.949 --> 22:01.089
We should be good to go
by the end of the week.

22:01.119 --> 22:02.792
Is good.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.233
Go and get the car.

22:06.224 --> 22:09.364
(cell phone chiming, beeps)

22:09.394 --> 22:10.600
Da??

22:10.629 --> 22:12.973
I am calling
to negotiate terms.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.944
Who the fuck is this?

22:15.967 --> 22:18.208
Mikhail, my father always told me,

22:18.236 --> 22:20.341
never ask a question
you already know the answer.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.874
You waste my fucking time.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.251
You thought I was dead,
didn't you?

22:24.276 --> 22:26.950
( Mutters )
Demyan.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.584
Look, Mikhail,
I hold the reins now.

22:31.616 --> 22:34.995
And fortunately for both you and I,
we are at the reset point.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.728
So I figure it's best
we negotiate terms swiftly

22:37.756 --> 22:39.633
while there's still blood
in the water.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.104
Da. I'm listening.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.941
You crawl into Vlad's grave
and bury yourself alive,

22:46.965 --> 22:50.674
or I will find you
and I'll kill you

22:50.702 --> 22:53.273
and I'll bury you myself.

22:54.272 --> 22:57.014
Those are my terms.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.077
( Beeps )

23:11.656 --> 23:13.397
(woman screaming)

23:13.425 --> 23:15.302
(grunting )

23:42.521 --> 23:44.057
What now?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.228
We hit them harder
than they hit us.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.068
I am going to unleash hell.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.033
Go.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.374
We need to think this through.
We need to be smart.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.744
I'm going to destroy him.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.875
Yeah, but we go to war with Demyan
and we can't go through Leo.

24:00.906 --> 24:05.355
His cleaner screwing up and
not eliminating Demyan as well as Vlad

24:05.377 --> 24:07.755
is the reason we have the problem
in the first place.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.953
But he's the only independent
in town.

24:10.982 --> 24:13.428
So what do you suggest?

24:14.553 --> 24:16.533
Did you ever hear of the Wolf?

24:17.522 --> 24:19.524
(chuckles)

24:19.558 --> 24:21.037
He's a fairy tale.

24:21.059 --> 24:25.371
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The stories I hear,
they're no fairy tale.

24:26.832 --> 24:29.870
Ari Perovsky has his number.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.780
( Keypad beeping )

24:36.975 --> 24:39.751
(dog barking )

24:39.778 --> 24:42.258
( phone ringing )

24:42.280 --> 24:44.055
( barking continues)

24:46.117 --> 24:48.927
- Shut it.
-( ringing )

24:49.921 --> 24:52.902
- What?
- Is this the man they call the Wolf?

24:52.924 --> 24:55.370
I prefer Aleksey,
but yes, they're one and the same.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.964
Can you be in Prague
by tomorrow?

24:57.996 --> 25:00.067
That's a bit
short notice there, mate.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.271
We'll double your rate.

25:02.300 --> 25:06.840
Okay, text me an address.
And until then, fuck off.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.909
( Phone beeps )

25:08.940 --> 25:12.080
Sorry about that.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.522
Now about that money
you be owing' Slim Jimmy...

25:14.546 --> 25:18.790
So, they sent a dog
to collect their scraps.

25:19.784 --> 25:23.288
Actually they sent a wolf.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.482
( Men grunting )

25:45.977 --> 25:48.287
Go!

25:56.888 --> 25:58.026
(cracks, thug groans)

26:10.468 --> 26:12.470
( moans)

26:16.241 --> 26:18.221
- Can you pay?
-( bone cracks)

26:18.243 --> 26:21.019
Ahhh!

26:21.046 --> 26:22.650
'Will yo "' Pa '2 _Yes!! v.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.524
-( Bone cracks)
- Ahh!

26:24.549 --> 26:27.826
- When?
- Ah! Stop, God damn it!

26:27.852 --> 26:30.196
It's in the other room.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.369
-( Bone cracks)
- Ah! Okay, okay!

26:33.391 --> 26:36.372
It's in the vault behind the bar!

26:39.397 --> 26:41.673
(whines)

26:43.535 --> 26:44.946
Ah-hh!

27:12.631 --> 27:15.237
One for the client...

27:19.070 --> 27:20.811
and the rest for me.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.849
( Knuckles pop)

27:33.084 --> 27:35.724
- Good dog.
-( barks )

28:41.820 --> 28:45.063
Fixer's voice: I've been watching her
for a long time now.

28:45.090 --> 28:49.300
We're like two trains on the same track
headed for a collision course.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.035
I've been reluctant
to deal with it.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.168
But sooner or later,
if I don't,

28:54.199 --> 28:56.907
it will deal with me.

28:56.935 --> 29:00.246
- The time is near.
-( phone ringing )

29:03.608 --> 29:04.882
Is that you, Leo?

29:04.909 --> 29:08.322
Leo: Usual place, tomorrow,
half past 3:00.

29:08.346 --> 29:09.848
- Hey, listen, it's my--
-( phone clicks)

29:36.608 --> 29:38.144
Excuse me.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.935
Well, hello, Ray.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.566
One unaccounted for.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.405
Yeah, so I was told.

30:00.431 --> 30:03.969
Hey, man, Mikhail is the one
who asked to make a show of it.

30:04.002 --> 30:07.347
If you didn't agree to the terms,
you shouldn't have accepted the job, Ray.

30:07.372 --> 30:08.942
Fair enough.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.714
He shouldn't have
pulled a woman in front of him.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.415
She was a whore.

30:13.812 --> 30:18.192
We work on results, Ray,
not excuses. You know that.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.095
I will finish with Demyan.
I can promise you that.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.497
You're a day late and a dollar short
for that, my friend.

30:23.521 --> 30:27.298
They've already hired in
another shooter for the job.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.498
So where does that leave me?

30:29.527 --> 30:32.974
I strongly doubt
that Mr. Mikhail Suverov

30:32.997 --> 30:37.309
will be requiring my services
anytime soon due to this little fiasco.

30:37.335 --> 30:41.044
They're angry, Ray.
And who can blame them?

30:41.072 --> 30:44.815
There's a million like Suverov,
just like him.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.346
Why do you think I rang?

30:55.286 --> 30:59.701
Another gig in my own back yard
doesn't exactly sit well with me, Leo.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.705
Besides, this looks like
we're biting the hand that feeds us.

31:02.727 --> 31:05.503
Not if the hand isn't
feeding you anymore, it isn't.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.601
Demyan wants to retaliate.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.203
And he's willing to pay
a lot more than the Suverovs.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.182
And hitting both brothers, well...

31:13.204 --> 31:15.946
he'll pay extra for that.

31:15.974 --> 31:19.217
Hey, Ray?
We started a war here.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.656
Wars are good for business.

31:21.679 --> 31:25.354
So you can cash in
or you can cash out.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.863
The choice is yours.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.684
And who the hell are you?

32:25.710 --> 32:27.883
Aleksey Andreev.

Well, I don't know.

What would you recommend
to be sipping on

33:28.740 --> 33:30.947
in a wet fucking heat
like the here and now?

33:30.975 --> 33:34.980
A tall glass of ice water
coupled with shots, sir.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.424
Are you all right with shots?

33:36.447 --> 33:38.791
I prefer it, in fact.

33:38.816 --> 33:42.730
Appleton Estate, 30-year-old rum
from Jamaica, sir.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.496
I think it would be
perfect in here, sir.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.539
I'm digging
the sales pitch there, boyo.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.737
I'll give it a go.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.774
So, my friend,
how do we begin?

34:00.805 --> 34:03.115
Introductions would be nice.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.348
Mikhail Suverov.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.652
Bobby Suverov.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.226
Aleksey.

34:11.248 --> 34:15.025
As for my unfortunate moniker,
I'd rather you not use it.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.964
It's so goddamn cliché.

34:16.987 --> 34:20.333
Yeah, whatever.
Aleksey, tell me,

34:20.358 --> 34:22.860
what do you know
about the current state of play

34:22.893 --> 34:24.771
here in the Golden City?

34:24.795 --> 34:27.072
Same old, same old,
I'd assume.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.079
Two parties of different opinions

34:30.101 --> 34:32.911
gnawing at each other's throats
over trivialities.

34:34.472 --> 34:37.351
- I like the way you think.
- I don't...

34:37.375 --> 34:41.346
think, that is.
I simply do.

34:41.379 --> 34:44.417
What exactly is it
that you do?

34:44.449 --> 34:45.951
(sighs)

34:45.983 --> 34:48.293
I play chess with the old Boromets
in the park

34:48.319 --> 34:50.663
every Tuesday,
Thursday afternoon.

34:50.688 --> 34:54.534
I restore cars from the '70s,
pinball machines from the '90s,

34:54.559 --> 34:56.869
and if you pay me enough,

34:56.893 --> 35:00.000
I'll probably kill
anything that breathes.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.442
Probably?

35:04.168 --> 35:06.876
As in no innocent party, mate.

35:06.904 --> 35:10.374
Kids are off the table regardless,
but I have no problem with women.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.081
Although I only shoot them.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.181
Using your hands
or a blade on a lady

35:14.212 --> 35:18.558
just comes across as rather weak
and rather tacky, you know?

35:18.583 --> 35:20.187
That's fair enough.

35:23.287 --> 35:27.201
So what is it
that you want me to do?

35:30.661 --> 35:32.436
Wreak havoc.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.670
This is Demyan lvanov,

35:34.699 --> 35:38.306
his underboss Grigori Rikoniev,
and his number two.

35:38.336 --> 35:41.317
And Nicholi Dvorak,
local Czech scum.

35:43.241 --> 35:47.314
Nicholi is the one that started this,
so he's up first.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.615
-( Muffled gunfire)
-( dull thud )

36:31.455 --> 36:33.264
Hello, Nicholi.

36:34.425 --> 36:35.631
Who are you?

36:36.761 --> 36:38.604
A trained monkey.

36:43.968 --> 36:45.970
But well enough paid

36:46.003 --> 36:48.381
to do the little touch.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.837
What are you doing, Ray?

37:24.508 --> 37:25.748
Seriously, it's time to go.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.551
I haven't finished my drink.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.457
Just finish the one you've got
and pay.

37:30.481 --> 37:32.518
( Belches )

37:32.550 --> 37:34.325
Ha.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.299
Bring me another drink now.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.699
Sorry, we're closed.
You've had enough. Go.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.898
Oh, yeah, bitch?
Then I'm taking this with me.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.998
- You're not taking anything-
- Get your fucking-

37:47.465 --> 37:48.944
- Ah!
- Let go of him.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.741
Okay, okay, I'll go.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.113
It's okay. Let go, please.
It's okay. Um...

37:55.640 --> 37:59.087
- Everything okay, Janice?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's okay.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.518
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no, no, no.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.720
No use crying over spilt milk.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.526
Huh. You're American.

38:08.552 --> 38:10.259
Yeah.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.700
- Give me a sec, okay?
- No, that's okay.

38:12.723 --> 38:15.226
No, I'll take care of this.
It'll just be a second.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.569
Club soda and salt,
works every time.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.969

-( cheering )
-( machine fluttering )

38:55.866 --> 38:59.609
(announcer speaking faintly)

39:01.372 --> 39:04.319
First they killed Vlad,
and then Demyan becomes boss.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.323
But is he happy
about his accidental promotion?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.985
No.
The bastard appreciates nothing.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.925
Hey, they served together
in Chechnya.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.020
Vlad took a bullet for Demyan.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.224
- They were brothers in blood.
- So what?

39:16.253 --> 39:17.891
Does that make me
less of a man

39:17.922 --> 39:20.198
because I didn't kill bitches
with them in Grozny?

39:20.224 --> 39:23.137
I mean, what about me?
First I'm the underboss's underboss,

39:23.160 --> 39:25.470
and then the boss dies
and what does that make me?

39:25.496 --> 39:27.874
I'm still a fucking underboss.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.945
Life is shit.

39:31.969 --> 39:34.677
You always see the glass half empty
when you drink, Grigori.

39:35.940 --> 39:40.218
Oh, by the way,
my glass is empty, Liev.

39:40.244 --> 39:43.817
Tell me, if I always
get to refill your fucking drinks,

39:43.848 --> 39:45.919
then what does that make me?

39:47.451 --> 39:49.124
An underboss.

39:50.287 --> 39:53.598
(thunder rumbling,
rain pattering )

39:53.624 --> 39:55.729
-( beeps )
- Two at table two,

39:55.760 --> 39:57.637
one at table three,

39:57.661 --> 40:00.335
four at table six,

40:00.364 --> 40:02.071
three at table eight.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.980
Two clips, 17 rounds apiece,
makes 34.

40:06.003 --> 40:09.644
10 men, three rounds apiece,
four slated to miss.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.896
Oi!

40:22.920 --> 40:25.662
Which one of you poor fools
is Grigori?

40:31.796 --> 40:33.867
Who the fuck are you?

40:58.689 --> 41:02.865
So the left's
only three in the clip,

41:02.893 --> 41:05.635
and the right...

41:14.238 --> 41:16.650
-( casing clatters)
- one in the chamber.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.918
It was a thing of beauty, no?

You know that shit
that killed Elvis, right?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.644
This shit here
definitely would.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.483
( laughs)

42:26.577 --> 42:29.956
Well, if it killed Elvis, it could kill me
and maybe I don't want to do it.

42:29.980 --> 42:33.450
Baby, relax.
It's just an expression. Come on.

42:33.484 --> 42:37.330
Well, it doesn't sound good.
You should think of a different expression.

42:37.354 --> 42:39.265
Just fucking do it.
Shut up.

42:45.429 --> 42:47.067
( Inhaling )

42:48.933 --> 42:51.345

I told you, right?

43:01.278 --> 43:02.757
Baby?

43:02.780 --> 43:04.691
What really did kill Elvis?

43:04.715 --> 43:08.390
That? Pills, something.
I don't know. Fuck.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.998
- You.
- Out.

43:22.232 --> 43:25.577
You-- you worked for us.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.015
Not anymore.

43:29.006 --> 43:31.782
Look, whatever it is
they're paying you,

43:31.809 --> 43:34.289
Mikhail will double it.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.657
Okay?
He'll triple it.

43:44.355 --> 43:48.030
No, wait. I mean...

43:48.058 --> 43:50.732
I'm his only brother.

43:50.761 --> 43:53.264
He should have had another.

43:58.669 --> 44:02.776
( Crying )
It's Bobby! It's Bobby!

44:02.806 --> 44:04.479
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- There's someone out there!

44:04.508 --> 44:06.385
He's got a gun!

44:31.802 --> 44:33.406
No!

What the fuck is going on,
Andrei?

45:17.014 --> 45:19.153
What's happened
to my goddamn update?

45:19.183 --> 45:21.857
Yeah, Leo--

45:21.885 --> 45:24.627
Leo's man took care
of Bobby last night.

45:24.655 --> 45:26.657
And Mikhail?

45:26.690 --> 45:30.797
From what I understand, he walked in
only seconds after the job was done.

45:30.828 --> 45:33.866
Hmm.
This is fucking beautiful.

45:33.897 --> 45:37.470
Yeah, I hear it's really
fucked Mikhail up.

45:37.501 --> 45:40.675
Of course it did.
This was his brother.

45:40.704 --> 45:42.706
He's been looking out for this kid
his whole life.

45:42.740 --> 45:46.586
Maybe this time he should try
looking out a little harder.

45:46.610 --> 45:49.454
I, uh...

45:49.480 --> 45:52.188
I got bits of bad news.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.992
What exactly is bad news, Andrei?

45:56.587 --> 45:59.090
They hit Nicholi Dvorak.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.659
What?

46:00.691 --> 46:05.106
The police found him floating in the pool,
9mm to the head.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.767
It's not the end of the world.

46:06.797 --> 46:08.902
We'll find somebody else
to do the business with.

46:11.101 --> 46:14.776
Andrei, is this it?
This is the bad news?

46:15.973 --> 46:18.817
Nicholi isn't the only one
who got hit.

46:18.842 --> 46:21.789
What are you talking about?
Who else?

46:21.812 --> 46:25.487
Somebody hit
the booking house.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.855
Killed everybody-

46:28.886 --> 46:30.797
killed all the boys.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.624
Grigori?

46:34.625 --> 46:38.801
Grigori, Liev--
everybody there dead.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.114
What about my money?

46:50.174 --> 46:51.983
I'm not sure.

46:52.009 --> 46:53.613
What the fuck do you mean
you're not sure?!

46:53.644 --> 46:55.624
L-- I just got bits and pieces.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.489
The cops were crawling
out of the place.

46:57.514 --> 47:00.290
- I couldn't stay for long, but--
- But nothing!

47:00.317 --> 47:04.129
- Find my goddamn money, Andrei!
- Yes, boss. I understand, yes.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.395
Just give me some time
to make some calls.

47:06.423 --> 47:08.767
Give me 20 minutes
and I'll call you right back.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.831
You've only got 10.

47:13.530 --> 47:14.634

( buzzing )

48:00.110 --> 48:01.885
( buzzes )

48:09.786 --> 48:12.164
- Hey-
- Hey-

48:12.189 --> 48:13.862
There you are.

48:15.025 --> 48:16.698
You left your jacket.

48:16.727 --> 48:20.038
Oh, right.
How'd you find me?

48:20.063 --> 48:23.510
Oh.
I found this in your pocket.

48:26.370 --> 48:29.351
- ( Chuckles )
- Address. Nice.

48:29.373 --> 48:31.114
It's clean, by the way.

48:31.141 --> 48:32.711
Oh. How much do I owe you?

48:32.743 --> 48:35.383
No, no, no. I did it myself.
It's good.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.653
Lucky for me, the right address
was in the envelope,

48:37.681 --> 48:39.558
because it didn't have your name.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.893
- I'm Ray.
- Oh.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.559
- Just Ray?
- Ray Carver.

48:44.588 --> 48:48.331
I'm Janice.
Look, I'm sorry for just stopping by.

48:48.358 --> 48:51.430
I just wanted to say thank you.
You know, you took off so fast, I--

48:51.461 --> 48:54.135
No, I'm glad you did. I--

48:54.164 --> 48:55.700
I guess I owe you one.

48:55.732 --> 48:57.803
Oh. yeah?

48:57.834 --> 48:59.836
Okay.

48:59.870 --> 49:02.441
Well, in that case, um...

49:03.674 --> 49:04.709
Mmm.

49:09.379 --> 49:10.619
Fair enough.

49:10.647 --> 49:12.888
Well, hopefully I'll--
I'll talk to you soon.

49:12.916 --> 49:14.452
Hopefully.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.796
Bye.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.762
( Sighs )
Shit.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.901
Did you lock yourself out?

49:27.931 --> 49:30.537
Nope, I'm good.
See ya.

49:30.567 --> 49:32.706
Okay.

50:00.197 --> 50:02.768
So...

50:02.799 --> 50:04.642
am I still on the payroll?

50:04.668 --> 50:06.204
Hmm.

50:06.236 --> 50:08.273
What would you have me do?

50:09.906 --> 50:12.079
If it were my way,

50:12.109 --> 50:14.953
I would have you raze this city
to the ground

50:14.978 --> 50:18.187
and salt every inch of it.

50:19.182 --> 50:21.958
But I made a promise
to my brother

50:21.985 --> 50:26.297
to be smart,
to think things through.

50:27.758 --> 50:30.034
Come with me.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.152
Mikhail.

50:49.179 --> 50:51.125
Leo.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.331
Hey, Aleksey.

50:58.622 --> 51:00.295
I heard you were in town.

51:01.391 --> 51:05.066
He's very expensive,
but he's worth it.

51:05.095 --> 51:06.665
You two have met?

51:06.696 --> 51:08.141
(chuckles)

51:08.165 --> 51:12.375
Let's just say that we both run
in similar circles.

51:13.437 --> 51:15.815
Why am I here, Mikhail?

51:15.839 --> 51:19.252
Your boy, whoever he is,

51:19.276 --> 51:22.189
he didn't finish the job
with Demyan,

51:22.212 --> 51:25.056
but he sure hit a home run

51:25.082 --> 51:27.392
when he killed my brother.

51:28.385 --> 51:32.231
Now exactly which boy
are we talking about?

51:32.255 --> 51:36.101
Bobby's girl
saw the black bastard.

51:36.126 --> 51:37.969
Come on, Leo, be honest.

51:37.994 --> 51:41.737
How many monkeys
are there in this city?

51:43.266 --> 51:48.272
Playing both sides
is a very dangerous game, my friend.

51:49.906 --> 51:51.681
I want to know his name

51:51.708 --> 51:54.484
and I want to know
where he sleeps.

51:54.511 --> 51:57.720
Come on, Mikhail,
you're taking a piss.

51:57.747 --> 51:59.749
What sort of handler
would I be

51:59.783 --> 52:03.060
if I kept tossing out the names
of my assets, eh?

52:03.086 --> 52:05.066
You disrespect me.

52:05.088 --> 52:08.399
You are lucky to be alive!

52:08.425 --> 52:11.269
You accepted the contract
for my brother.

52:11.294 --> 52:14.434
That makes you
directly involved in his death.

52:14.464 --> 52:19.038
You should be counting your
fucking blessings that I am asking you.

52:19.069 --> 52:22.915
My black bastard
isn't mine anymore.

52:26.376 --> 52:29.983
Not since he cost me
my livelihood with you.

52:30.013 --> 52:33.722
Come on, Mikhail!
You're my best client.

52:33.750 --> 52:35.787
Do I look that stupid?

52:36.786 --> 52:39.892
If you're lying to me,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

52:39.923 --> 52:42.767
I don't doubt you, Mikhail.

52:42.792 --> 52:45.705
I've known you for a long time.

52:46.930 --> 52:50.468
You tell me everything you know
about this boy.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.817
I will tell you one thing-

52:57.807 --> 53:00.583
if you go looking for him,

53:00.610 --> 53:03.784
he'll find you first.
I promise you.

54:13.049 --> 54:14.790
That's not him.

54:59.896 --> 55:02.638
-( Siren wailing)
-( honking )

55:02.666 --> 55:05.169
( indistinct police radio)

55:11.741 --> 55:13.186
( phone beeps )

55:15.812 --> 55:18.418
( ringing )

55:18.448 --> 55:21.190
This is longer than 10 minutes.

55:21.217 --> 55:24.824
I'm sorry. I had to reach out
to a friend of mine at the department.

55:24.854 --> 55:25.992
It wasn't easy.

55:30.527 --> 55:32.438
And?

55:32.462 --> 55:34.772
The cops took the money.

55:34.798 --> 55:36.778
They have it in evidence
downtown.

55:39.135 --> 55:41.513
I did find out, though,

55:41.538 --> 55:43.540
that there was a survivor
at the betting room,

55:43.573 --> 55:46.110
one of the bookies.
He saw the whole thing.

55:46.142 --> 55:48.918
According to him,
this huge guy

55:48.945 --> 55:50.754
came right to the front door,

55:50.780 --> 55:54.318
called out Grigori,
whipped out two 9mms

55:54.351 --> 55:56.297
and started blazing.

55:56.319 --> 55:58.993
One guy?
This is bullshit, Andrei.

55:59.022 --> 56:02.367
What the bookie said he looked like
is even crazier.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.803
What do you mean?

56:03.827 --> 56:06.364
Seven-foot tall,
wearing a tacky Hawaiian shirt

56:06.396 --> 56:07.704
with a white fedora.

56:09.532 --> 56:13.139
He said he looked like
a Frank Sinatra on steroids.

56:14.137 --> 56:15.673
The Wolf.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.242
What?

56:18.274 --> 56:20.185
Mikhail-

56:20.210 --> 56:22.713
he hired an out-of-towner.
He hired the Wolf.

56:22.746 --> 56:26.159
But the Wolf is just
a bullshit ghost story.

56:26.182 --> 56:29.186
No.
No, he's as real as it gets.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.223
He must have been the same one
who took out Vlad as well.

56:33.890 --> 56:35.733
What are we going to do?

56:35.759 --> 56:37.295
What the fuck
do you think we're going to do?

56:37.327 --> 56:38.863
We're going to go Wolf hunting.

56:41.831 --> 56:44.004
Everyone bleeds, Andrei.

56:44.033 --> 56:48.072
Put the word out-- I will pay top dollar
to find this guy, okay?

56:48.104 --> 56:51.608
- Okay, I understand.
- Good.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.848
Meet me tomorrow
at the betting room at 5:00.

56:53.877 --> 56:56.187
Don't be late,
and fuckin' bring me something.

56:56.212 --> 56:59.091
- Something good.
- Okay.

57:00.083 --> 57:01.460
( Phone beeps )

57:06.356 --> 57:09.428
Leo, this is my third message.

57:09.459 --> 57:11.063
What the hell is going on?

57:11.094 --> 57:13.074
How'd they know
I was going to be there?

57:13.096 --> 57:14.803
Call me back!

57:14.831 --> 57:16.333
( Phone beeps )

57:18.067 --> 57:19.569
( doorbell buzzes )

57:27.043 --> 57:29.182
( buzzing )

57:31.748 --> 57:33.489
( door closes, keys rattle )

57:40.990 --> 57:42.435
(bolt clicks)

57:44.527 --> 57:46.404
Wow.

57:46.429 --> 57:48.033
Not bad.

57:53.837 --> 57:55.817
Can I get you a drink?

57:55.839 --> 57:57.546
No, I'm good. Thanks.

58:00.343 --> 58:04.951
Look, it's just your accent,
you being from the States and all...

58:04.981 --> 58:07.018
Mmm.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.462
I guess you remind me
of home.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.296
Mmm, ah.
You miss it?

58:12.322 --> 58:15.769
Yeah.
But I had to leave.

58:15.792 --> 58:17.465
Why?

58:19.195 --> 58:21.038
Too many bad memories.

58:22.131 --> 58:25.943
And now sometimes I think
I'm just in this city to hide, you know?

58:25.969 --> 58:27.676
Too scared to go back.

58:27.704 --> 58:29.706
Right. Scared of what?

58:38.147 --> 58:40.058
My dad was murdered.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.502
The guy that did it--
they never found him.

58:48.591 --> 58:51.595
He had this mask on.

58:51.628 --> 58:54.131
I saw him, though.
I saw the whole thing.

58:56.099 --> 58:59.205
I was just a little girl,

58:59.235 --> 59:02.114
but, hmm,
I'll never forget.

59:05.108 --> 59:06.985
I'm sorry.

59:11.014 --> 59:12.687
I mean, that's tough.

59:16.085 --> 59:17.996
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.904
( Phone rings)

59:30.934 --> 59:34.507
I'm sorry.
I have to get this.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.207
Leg?

59:38.241 --> 59:40.915
I'm sorry, mate,
but I did you wrong.

59:41.911 --> 59:43.322
What's up?

59:43.346 --> 59:45.986
Things are going to get
pretty tough for us, Ray.

59:46.015 --> 59:47.460
What are you telling me, Leo?

59:47.483 --> 59:49.759
I'm gonna get out of Dodge.

59:49.786 --> 59:52.266
You gotta get out too.
Get outta Prague.

59:52.288 --> 59:55.235
Mikhail clamped the vise.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.566
And I gave you up--

59:57.560 --> 59:59.562
your name,
where you're gonna be,

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.906
where you live.
All of it. I'm sorry, mate.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.379
If I didn't, I was history.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.774
Sorry.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.718
( Phone beeps )

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.361
Hey.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.492
This belonged to my dad.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.058
He took it everywhere.

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.503
Why is it here?

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.033
Tell me!

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.374
There's pictures of me in here.
This is my life.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.743
What-- why?

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.077
Did you have something to do
with his death?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.719
Huh?
Tell me.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.791
Tell me. Tell me!

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.224
Yes.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.232
Why?

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:05.637
Because it was
what I was hired to do.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.732
And now you're here
to kill me?

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.905
No.
I'm trying to protect you.

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:18.248
Am I supposed to
believe that, really?

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.983
(sobbing, muttering )

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.655
( door opens, closes )

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.176
Catch you at a bad time?

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.447
I threw you out the window.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.615
I bounce real good.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.789
And the grenades?

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.560
I thought it was a nice touch.

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.235
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.007
The bad guy.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.813
That's funny.

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:26.977
I thought I was.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.585
(faint club music playing)

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:17.295
We just got back
from the black guy's place.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.301
Is it over?
Is he dead?

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.303
No, I don't think so.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.236
What happened?

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.504
The place was a mess.
But no bodies.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.738
We thought this might be
interesting to you.

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.973
The same girl--
she's in every picture.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:50.861
And Aleksey?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.390
I called him.

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.631
He told me to tell you
goodbye.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.042
( Mutters softly )
Shit.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.027
Guess what?

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.229
Thrill me.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:32.933
We got an anonymous tip

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.499
about Mikhail's new man.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:39.673
You're right-
it is the Wolf.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:48.554
He's staying at some
high-end hotel downtown.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.230
We end this.

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:02.564
We end this now.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.356
( Keypad beeping )

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.688

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.194
Recording: Hi, this is Janice.
Please leave a message

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.822
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Thanks.

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:37.990
( Beeps )

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:42.264
Hey, Janice, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:45.272
It's just I, uh...

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:47.274
Just call me back.

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:48.798
( Phone beeps off)

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:30.245
- You ready?
- Shit.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.548
I mean yeah.

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.219
Shh.

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.371
Yeah?

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.711
Ray, how the hell are you, mate?

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.075
Leg?

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.675
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me.

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:55.120
Why are you calling me
from Janice's phone, Leo?

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.750
I got down here as soon as I could
just like you asked.

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.196
How many waiting for me?

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.856
( laughs)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:07.595
She's here right now.
Lovely girl, Ray.

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.502
Hey, you should have told me
about her before.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.500
We are actually
getting rat-assed together.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.840
Can you get out?

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.106
No, no, no, no can do.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:21.580
She's a bit tied up at the moment,
taking someone's order.

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:24.106
The place
is absolutely jumping, Ray.

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.880
I'm on my way.

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:31.218
Hey, we'll tie one off before we get
out of this dump for good, shall we?

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:32.418
Right.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.060
( Beeps off )

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.620
Did I overdo it?

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:39.565
Depends on whether or not
he shows.

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:44.367
He'll show, trust me.
You won't be disappointed.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.600
(crowd cheering )

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.312
(door creaking )

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.068
You've never looked better, Leo.

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.503
(chuckling )

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:21.064
It's the one-armed push-ups, Ray.

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.769
Where is she?

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.938
She's with Mikhail.
Said he was going back to the club.

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.855
Sorry, Ray.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:44.296
Looks like I four-letter-worded you
again, mate.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:49.291
They say after the second time,
you should give flowers

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.804
or a box of candy.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.864
Let's go.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.513
I wish I had something
to give you.

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:09.020
Maybe you still can.

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.387
Thank you, Ray.

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:26.432
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.093

(dog grunting )

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:49.828
I spent a lot of time
and came a long way

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.964
to ask you
one extremely short question.

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:55.031
Why didn't I kill you?

01:23:57.766 --> 01:24:00.337
Nobody paid me to kill you.

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:05.716
But the next logical question is...

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.550
what the fuck
are you doing in my house?

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:14.183
I never really enjoyed being manipulated
by those underworld assholes,

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.286
so then I thought to myself-

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:19.662
"Aleksey, there are a lot of assholes
out there with lots of money.

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:22.827
Instead of earning it from them...

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.198
why don't we
just take it from them?"

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.737
Why not?

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.977
Maybe I'll give you
a call sometime.

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:41.651
That, my friend, you may.

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:44.816

Lamentations 3:26--

should both hope and quietly wait

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.497
for the salvation of the Lord."

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:04.775
No matter where you run,

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:08.008
you always end up
right back where it all started,

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:10.209
back with yourself.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:15.482
Maybe I'll never know
how I ended up where I have.

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:18.354
I do know that the price
I have to pay

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:21.258
is that I'll never be saved,

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.920
but at least she can be.
