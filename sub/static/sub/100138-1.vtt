01:36.320 --> 01:39.756
(WATER SLOSHES)

01:58.280 --> 01:59.600
Open the bloody door!

02:06.960 --> 02:09.473
What in the world...?

02:09.600 --> 02:12.911
This is Lyra and Pantalaimon.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.111
- Asriel...
- I hereby invoke

02:15.240 --> 02:17.390
the privilege of scholastic sanctuary!

02:18.600 --> 02:20.671
Scholastic sanctuary?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.519
Jordan College is a place of learning.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.280
It's not suitable for a child!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.198
Outside of the college, she is not safe.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.799
I have no choice.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.238
I have no choice!

02:34.360 --> 02:36.795
You keep her safe!

02:58.080 --> 02:59.912
Lyra, the rules are simple.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.998
- We know the rules, Pan.
- You don't obey the rules.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.589
- It doesn't mean I don't know 'em.
- We need to win this time.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.870
- Just count us down.
- Three, two...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.752
- ...one.
- Oi! Cheat!

03:15.480 --> 03:17.153
Lyra!

03:17.280 --> 03:18.714
Sorry, Mrs Woodbridge!

03:18.840 --> 03:20.433
I'll help you clean it later!

03:23.440 --> 03:25.511
(SQUEAKS)

03:25.640 --> 03:28.280
- Mind yourself!
- Lyra!

03:31.400 --> 03:33.357
Lyra! Class!

03:33.480 --> 03:36.154
Phys ed, Master! Sharpen the body,
sharpen the mind!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.154
Roger!

03:46.280 --> 03:48.840
- This way. I know a short cut!
- Are you sure?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.358
Lyra!

03:52.480 --> 03:54.517
Lyra, will you wait?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.154
That's the last time I listen to you,
Salcilia!

04:02.360 --> 04:03.714
Lyra!

04:05.160 --> 04:06.673
Cheat!

04:06.800 --> 04:09.189
You know I hate it down here!

04:20.480 --> 04:22.072
Lyra?

04:26.800 --> 04:27.949
Lyra?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.279
- LYRA: Boo!
- (GASPS)

04:43.400 --> 04:44.674
(LYRA GIGGLES)

04:44.800 --> 04:46.473
These coffins have got skeletons in them.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.558
All coffins have got skeletons in them,
Roger, that's sort of the point!

04:49.680 --> 04:52.320
Yeah, but I can see these skeletons!

04:52.440 --> 04:53.953
Only the ones with the open caskets.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.879
Makes you wonder what's
inside the ones that are closed.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.194
I wasn't thinking that.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.038
No.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.993
Why do daemons disappear when you die,

05:06.120 --> 05:09.750
and yet humans leave these
nasty skeletons behind?

05:11.160 --> 05:14.073
Do you ever think about
what animal Pan will settle as

05:14.200 --> 05:15.952
when he stops changing form?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.309
I think about it.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.919
Pan and I talk about it.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.311
Pan thinks he will be a lion.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.919
I don't!

05:25.040 --> 05:28.351
I think he'll settle as a sloth
or a guinea pig.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.279
You said you wanted something cunning,
like a fox.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.038
And you? What do you think Salcilia
will settle as?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.037
Oh.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.879
A house marten or a house cat?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.116
Then let's drink on that.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.310
Drink?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.158
Lyra!

05:52.880 --> 05:54.154
Lyra!

06:08.720 --> 06:09.915
We should go!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.479
The storm is upon us.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.352
Not yet.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.278
(WIND HOWLS)

06:16.400 --> 06:18.391
We should have enough time.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.874
I need one more!

06:28.560 --> 06:30.949
We have to find us a way off the mountain.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.957
- Pack up.
- Yes, yes, all right!

06:33.080 --> 06:34.150
Quickly.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.190
Favour your right side down the face.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.473
(STRAINS)

07:13.160 --> 07:17.358
Thorold! This is the one.
I think we've got it.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.313
I know the Magisterium have never ventured
this far north,

07:20.440 --> 07:23.671
but, really,
I feel we're pushing our luck here.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.077
Jordan College are going to take
some convincing.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.910
I have to be certain of what we have
before I stand in front of them.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.155
Come on.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.553
Here we are.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.717
- Are your hands clean?
- Yes, sir.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.351
We'll let the storm blow itself out.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.431
It's finally time for us
to put on a show for the scholars.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.991
We'll head south in the morning.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.475
But we're taking a friend.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.313
If I can't convince them, he will!

10:01.320 --> 10:06.394
TEACHER: Eyes will be opened, and
your daemons will assume their true form,

10:06.520 --> 10:10.195
and ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.632
Lyra, if you could try to stay awake?

10:16.760 --> 10:19.479
I am. I'm listening, I'm listening.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.750
I'm a god, knowing good and evil.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.394
As gods, Lyra. (CHUCKLES)

10:24.520 --> 10:27.876
The Magisterium wouldn't approve
of blasphemy.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.958
I thought we were protected by
scholastic sanctuary?

10:31.080 --> 10:35.199
Yes. A privilege we had to earn
and one we must not abuse.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.075
Without scholastic sanctuary,
you wouldn't be here and nor would I.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.510
You would do well to remember that, Lyra.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.475
- Lyra! It's your uncle.
- Now, then, where were we?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.074
Ah, yes.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.320
Finally, I'll get to
go to the North with him.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.716
Lyra, don't do anything stupid.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.037
Librarian, will you read me

11:04.160 --> 11:07.790
that fascinating piece on the serpent's
motivations in the Garden of Eden again?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.672
I don't exist to entertain you, Lyra.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.711
And the Magisterium wouldn't approve...

11:11.840 --> 11:13.717
Please?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.475
Where is it?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.637
Ah, yes.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.479
We put it up here, didn't we?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.716
Now, where is it?

11:26.840 --> 11:28.433
Ah, there we go.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.470
Ah.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.035
(CHUCKLES) Thank you, Serena.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.480
There you go.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.080

11:47.000 --> 11:49.276
All right, you've had your fun.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.118
Not yet I haven't.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.677
He's here.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.154
Asriel.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.959
It's time.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.430
No, Lyra, don't!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.278
The Retiring Room is expressly forbidden.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.596
Not for family reunions.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.553
All right, that was close.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.550
Yes, Master.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.478

13:07.600 --> 13:10.911
Lord Asriel was most partial to that,
as I remember.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.439
Good. Now leave me, please.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.949
We don't know what he put in it.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.878
If it was innocent,
why did he send the butler away?

13:44.000 --> 13:48.233
The Master's a good man.
He's always been kind to us.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.159
He's poisoning my uncle, Pan.

especially for you, my Lord.

If this evening goes as expected,

14:42.440 --> 14:45.159
we won't sleep for a while.

- Let go of me and I'll tell you.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.076
I will break your arm first.

The wine was poisoned!

15:16.920 --> 15:18.638
(LYRA GROANS)

15:20.240 --> 15:22.959
I saw the Master poison your wine.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.434
You saw him?

15:24.560 --> 15:25.789
Yes.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.991
He added white powder and...

15:28.120 --> 15:32.432
Pan thinks it's me being dramatic, but...
You see? I ain't lying.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.710
Why would the Master poison you?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.399
I thought he was our friend.

(PAN YELPS)

15:40.320 --> 15:42.391
That was clumsy, wasn't it?

Yes.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.793
Someone tries to kill you,
and you just destroy the evidence?

15:46.920 --> 15:48.513
Keep your voice down.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.951
Someone probably tries to kill me
and, yes, I destroy the evidence.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.753
Surely you should be doing something.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.678
I am doing something.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.111
I'm wondering why the Master would want
to do that to me.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.516
I'm sure he had a good reason.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.280
To be honest with you,
if I were him, I'd be afraid of me.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.074
I have waited for over a year to see you!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.077
For nothing.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.952
- You're infuriating.
- And you're tenacious!

16:13.080 --> 16:15.196
At least you used to be.
Now, do you want a job?

16:15.320 --> 16:16.913
- No!
- You might find it a little cramped...

16:17.040 --> 16:20.954
- I don't want a job.
- I want you to spy on the Master.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.591
Everything he does, but particularly
whenever Dust is mentioned.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.040
Do you think you can do that?

become a channel for gossip,

- Exactly!

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

17:19.480 --> 17:20.878
Thank you, Master.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.830
As some of you already know,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.952
I set out for the North some 12 month ago

17:28.079 --> 17:30.674
on a diplomatic mission
to the King of Lapland.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.677
At least, that's what
I was pretending to be doing.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.316
In actual fact, my real aim
was to go further north still,

17:36.440 --> 17:37.350
right on to the ice,

17:37.480 --> 17:41.110
to try and discover what had
happened to the Grumman expedition.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.278
This is the first of the discoveries
I made.

17:48.720 --> 17:53.078
I took this photogram with
a standard silver nitrate emulsion.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.910
However...

17:56.960 --> 17:58.712
...] took two photograms that day -

17:58.840 --> 18:03.277
the second one with
a specially prepared emulsion.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.550
- Where does that light come from?
- It isn't light.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.114
It's Dust.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.310
- What?
- Dust?

18:08.440 --> 18:10.033
(FELLOWS MURMUR)

18:10.160 --> 18:11.195
PAN: What's Dust?

18:11.320 --> 18:13.880
(WHISPERS) Shh! I need to see
what he's showing them.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.832
Gentlemen, it is Dust!

18:18.200 --> 18:20.396
It registers as light on the plate
because particles of Dust

18:20.520 --> 18:23.717
react with this emulsion in the same way

18:23.840 --> 18:27.435
that photons of light react with
the standard silver nitrate emulsion.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.632
As you can see, the figure of the man
is now perfectly visible,

18:30.760 --> 18:32.831
but I'd like you to turn your attention
to the child.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.950
We can't see the child clearly

18:34.080 --> 18:36.833
because the child does not
attract Dust, which,

18:36.960 --> 18:41.670
given the nature of Dust,
is precisely the point, is it not?

18:41.800 --> 18:45.316
We, as adults, are surrounded by Dust.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.511
In fact, we're almost consumed by it.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.755
- But children...
- (LIGHT THUD)

18:48.880 --> 18:50.518
...it seems, are not.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.237
Gentleman, I believe this is proof

18:54.360 --> 18:57.796
that Dust is exclusively
attracted to adults,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.833
just as the Magisterium
has always suspected.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.670
My next discovery, however, may be
considered even more heretical.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.189
Asriel, be very careful!

19:08.320 --> 19:10.311
That's only where it begins to
get exciting, Master.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.317
- (BOTH WHISPER)
- In one of his last messages

19:12.440 --> 19:14.192
to the Academy in Berlin,

19:14.320 --> 19:17.153
Grumman made reference to
a certain natural phenomenon

19:17.280 --> 19:18.918
only seen in the lands of the North.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.634
I believe this
is what he was referring to.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.353
I took this photogram a few days ago.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.233
- The Aurora, the Northern Lights.
- Yes, that's right,

19:26.360 --> 19:29.159
when seen with the ordinary emulsion,

19:29.280 --> 19:32.079
but I'd like you to look at it again
using mine.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.033
A city in the sky.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.798
(EXCITED CHATTER)

19:41.200 --> 19:42.429
Pan, it's beautiful.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.679
A myriad of worlds of which
the Magisterium controls only one.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.360
A myriad of worlds made visible

19:49.480 --> 19:53.235
only through that most distasteful
of substances - Dust!

19:53.360 --> 19:55.874
Clear the room! None of us can hear this!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.911
I'm afraid you Aave to hear this, Master.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.519
These are heretical discussions!

19:59.640 --> 20:00.914
Necessary discussions.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.317
I believe Grumman found evidence
of these multiple worlds,

20:04.440 --> 20:06.670
and he paid for it with his life.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.710
His life?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.229
I found his body preserved in the ice
off Svalbard.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.716
I brought back his head as befits
a scholar of this college!

20:13.840 --> 20:15.433
I believe you knew him best, Sub-Rector?

20:15.560 --> 20:18.439
My eyes are not very clear,
and the ice is dirty,

20:18.560 --> 20:19.994
but it could be Grumman.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.192
- Who would have done this?
- It's most likely the Magisterium

20:23.320 --> 20:26.551
trying to mask their tracks,
to keep us safely innocent,

20:26.680 --> 20:29.194
or, as the Master would have it,
academically free.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.472
Gentlemen, there is a war raging right now

20:32.600 --> 20:36.070
between those trying to keep us in
ignorance and those, like Grumman,

20:36.200 --> 20:40.319
willing to fight for the light,
to fight for true academic freedom.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.512
Gentlemen,
he was a member of this college,

20:43.640 --> 20:47.634
his work was profoundly important,
and I need funding to continue it.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.991
Who will stand against me?

21:08.440 --> 21:12.559
WOMAN:
# Rejoice for your path is secure

21:12.680 --> 21:19.154
ALL # For all the journeys to be endured

21:19.280 --> 21:24.400
WOMAN: # Rejoice for your path is decided

21:24.520 --> 21:27.638
ALL: # You and daemon

21:27.760 --> 21:32.960
# Back to the flame undivided... #

21:47.800 --> 21:49.791
We are here

21:49.920 --> 21:53.390
to give thanks and tribute.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.557
My son's daemon...

21:55.680 --> 21:58.240
...has settled as a hawk.

22:03.760 --> 22:07.719
Lyuba - soul, companion
and protector of my son.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.910
I welcome you in your settled form
to my family,

22:14.040 --> 22:15.758

my boy

22:15.880 --> 22:17.154
and my trust.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.953
(CHIRPS)

22:19.080 --> 22:22.152
This ring confirms the settling
of your daemon

22:22.280 --> 22:25.716
and your transition from child to man.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.353
(CHEERING)

22:34.920 --> 22:40.040
Who here will help guide Lyuba and Tony?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.514
Sura and I will.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.200
Thank you, Benjamin de Ruyter!

22:58.640 --> 23:00.233
- Pleasure.
- Happy to.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.877
...we ask that you uphold
the Gyptian ways.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.879
Others may see us as outcasts,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.640
but we are one unified family,

23:10.760 --> 23:14.355
and so we ask you and Lyuba

23:14.480 --> 23:18.155
to protect and fight
for the freedoms of all,

23:18.280 --> 23:20.317

23:52.280 --> 23:54.749
Oh, both my little boys.

23:54.880 --> 23:58.191
He's been following me and pestering me
all day and night, before the ceremony.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.152
You became a man tonight.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.157
- Well done, Tony.
- Thank you.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.114
He stayed a boy.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.198
He wants to know you're
still his big brother.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.596
Of course I'm still his big brother.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.789
Go on, go.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.150

26:53.320 --> 26:55.152
(SIGHS) Yes, they did.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.634
What's Dust?

26:56.760 --> 26:58.637
It's nothing to do with you.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.070
It is to do with me.

27:01.200 --> 27:05.114
You told me to spy for you. Now you have
to tell me what I was spying about.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.516
Lyra, there are things that...

27:11.520 --> 27:14.353
There are such things...

27:15.880 --> 27:18.838
...that you're better off
not understanding just yet.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.638
Can I see the man's head?

27:24.760 --> 27:25.909
No!

27:27.080 --> 27:29.959
Why would I let you do that?

27:34.240 --> 27:38.677
The Master - can we still trust him?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.394
I don't trust anyone.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.272
Go to sleep, Lyra.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.077
Take me north with you.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.674
Goodnight, Lyra.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.829
I have no idea how, but he knew.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.110
He spilt the decanter himself.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.356
Forgive me, Master,
but I can't help being relieved.

28:04.760 --> 28:08.151
I was never happy about the idea...
of murder!

28:10.720 --> 28:13.439
Hardly anyone would be happy
with that idea, Charles,

28:13.560 --> 28:16.632
but the balance of Jordan College
was at stake.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.639
There is a great change coming
that will threaten us all,

28:19.760 --> 28:23.151
and the alethiometer warns
of appalling consequences

28:23.280 --> 28:25.430
should Asriel continue his research.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.518
Apart from anything else,
the child will be drawn in...

28:29.640 --> 28:31.790
- This is about Lyra?
- Yes.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.515
She has a part to play in all this,
and a major one.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.559
The irony is, she has to do it all without
realising what she's doing.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.557
But she's just an innocent girl!

28:43.680 --> 28:45.717
And she needs to stay one!

28:46.800 --> 28:47.995
Which has meant protecting her,

28:48.120 --> 28:50.157
making sure the college was unimpeachable.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.113
But there's little chance
that Asriel's heresy

28:53.240 --> 28:55.038
will not get back to the Magisterium.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.073
You're saying we have to let her go?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.830
The alethiometer says that Lyra
has to make a journey.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.839
What kind of journey?

29:04.960 --> 29:08.715
One which, I'm afraid,
includes a great betrayal.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.036
Well, who's going to betray her? Asriel?

29:12.240 --> 29:13.753
That's the saddest thing.

29:13.880 --> 29:17.111
She will be the betrayer,

29:17.240 --> 29:21.393
and the experience will be terrible.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.557
We can keep her here.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.795
We must!

29:24.920 --> 29:26.274
I know you care for her.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.233
You've truly taught her
as well as you could, Charles,

29:29.360 --> 29:32.432
but all we can be is scared for her.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.519
And scared of her.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.553
Come on, hurry up.

29:58.360 --> 30:02.433

- Great, you're here! I'm starving.

30:02.560 --> 30:06.030
- I brought you an extra sausage.
- You mean you got an extra for yourself.

This may be true.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.438
I missed dinner last night.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.710

30:17.840 --> 30:19.069
In a cupboard.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.873
The whole night?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.673
Most of it.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.870
It's...

30:24.000 --> 30:25.195
...complicated.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.795
- Have you ever heard about Dust?
- Dust?

30:29.920 --> 30:32.639
I'm guessing you don't mean
the stuff we polish off?

30:32.760 --> 30:33.795
Uh-uh.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.514
- Where should I start?
- Are you all right, Lyra?

30:37.640 --> 30:39.597
Just thinking aloud.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.519
Well, there's two things you need to know.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.235
A Gyptian boy, Billy Costa, is missing.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.271
Billy Costa?

30:48.400 --> 30:50.596
I remember him - Tony's brother.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.599
Some people are saying
there's a man with bright eyes,

30:53.720 --> 30:57.156
others say it's a singing man
with a fox daemon.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.873
It's got to be the Gobblers.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.793
The Gobblers?

31:01.920 --> 31:05.993
I've told you the Gobblers are a myth,
Roger, they don't exist!

31:06.120 --> 31:08.191
The Gyptians will find Billy.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.275
Fine.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.392
But don't blame me when I get to say,
"I told you so."

Second thing.

You're not leaving!

31:41.080 --> 31:42.354
I can't stay!

- There was nothing...
- I know.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.118
- Lord Faa.
- Where is Ma Costa?

34:02.240 --> 34:04.675
We told her to wait on her boat
in case Billy returns there.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.598
And the rest of our people?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.438
State Police have shown no interest.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.029
Hmph. No surprises there.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.797
So we're organising teams of our own.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.038
We've got a group that went north from
Magdalen Bridge up the Cherwell.

34:16.159 --> 34:20.358
Nothing. We divided Jericho,
we staked out the airship station.

34:20.480 --> 34:24.838
John, the Gobblers will have got him
out of Oxford by now.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.438
You think it's the Gobblers?

34:26.560 --> 34:29.359
The Gobblers haven't took my brother.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.556
Yeah, but why?
What can they want with them?

34:46.679 --> 34:48.000
That we don't know.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.353
We don't know what they do,
but we will find out.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.598
We have word they are taking
the children to London.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.155
Maybe it's the best way to hide them.

No, no, Ma would never agree to that!

Billy's lost, he's not been taken.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.949
Continue the search. Cover as much
of this area as we can today.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.832
And if we do not find him here,

35:12.960 --> 35:16.476
we'll go to London and find him there.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.833
Where are you, Billy?

35:26.320 --> 35:29.870
Well, if he won't take us,
I'll find another way to go north.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.310
You are aware that I work here, right?

35:32.440 --> 35:36.229
And you're pretty much stuck here
because we're orphans

35:36.360 --> 35:39.079
and both of us have no money.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.318
Sometimes you've got to have dreams.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.033
We're going north, Roger.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.833
I just know we are.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.473
If you say so.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.877
MAN: He worked them up into a fervour.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.991
They were almost riotous by the time
he finished.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.838
NEW SPEAKER:
We're sure this information is correct?

36:19.960 --> 36:22.520
I had good people inside the room.

36:22.640 --> 36:26.395
So Asriel claims he can see Dust now?

36:26.520 --> 36:29.512
It's not what he can see,
it's what he claims to see through it.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.999
A hidden city.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.639
Other worlds.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.230
The Master of Jordan College risks him
saying as much?

36:42.760 --> 36:44.433
Scholastic sanctuary.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.870
The Master cannot be so naive
as to imagine

36:47.000 --> 36:50.709
that scholastic sanctuary protects him
from the accusation of heresy.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.194
Asriel clearly got the better of him.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.880
They've given him an enormous
amount of money...

36:55.000 --> 36:58.880
...to travel north
and continue with his work.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.752
Discover all you can,
and by all means permitted.

37:13.880 --> 37:17.589
This kind of heresy is of the
highest priority to the Magisterium.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.472
I shall take it to the Cardinal.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.671
- Yes, Father.
- I need to know where he's going

37:21.800 --> 37:25.794
and what exactly he intends to achieve.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.434
I will do all that I can.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.795
Oh, Boreal.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.718
Yes, Father?

37:33.840 --> 37:36.195
Not a word to any of our mutual friends.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.593
That includes her.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.792
ALL: Benedic, Domine

38:05.920 --> 38:07.274
Nos et dona tua

38:07.400 --> 38:09.232
Quae de largitate

38:09.360 --> 38:11.636
Tua sumus sumpturi

38:11.760 --> 38:13.353
<i>EX concede</i>

38:13.480 --> 38:16.154
Ut illis salubriter

38:16.280 --> 38:22.549
Nutriti tibi obsequium praestare valeamus

38:22.680 --> 38:26.674
Per Christum Dominum nostrum.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.794
Amen.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.912
ALL: Amen.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.032
Good evening, Mrs Coulter.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.753
Good evening, Master.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.350
Lyra, this is Mrs Coulter.
She may be of some interest to you.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.479
Hello.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.479
I am not used to the grandeur of this
at all.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.399
You'll have to tell me
which knife and fork to use.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.239
- Oh!
- I don't want to make a fool of myself.

39:03.280 --> 39:07.274
- Are you a female scholar?
- You seem surprised.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.438
Well, female scholars
don't dress like you.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.517
I'll take that as a compliment.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.833
No, I'm not really a scholar.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.236
I'm a member of St Sophia's College,

39:20.360 --> 39:22.192
but most of my work takes place
outside Oxford.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.594
Hi, Lyra.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.678
But I'm not interesting.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.359
You are.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.835
Tell me about yourself, Lyra.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.395
Oh, well, nothing to say, really!

39:33.520 --> 39:36.239
So reports you use the rooftops as
your private thoroughfare

39:36.360 --> 39:38.271
are completely false, are they?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.312
(BOTH LAUGH)

39:41.440 --> 39:42.874
How do you know about that?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.435
You are quite something, aren't you?

39:45.560 --> 39:48.359
I'm surprised Asriel
doesn't talk about you more.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.232
You know my uncle?

39:50.360 --> 39:53.716
Oh, yeah, we occasionally bump into
each other at the Arctic Institute.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.239
You're an explorer too?

39:55.360 --> 39:58.671
(LAUGHS) Oh, that's such a grand word.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.996
But, yes, I suppose I am.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.349
Have you...?

40:02.480 --> 40:04.676
Have you ever seen an armoured bear?
Or Tartars?

40:04.800 --> 40:06.359
Well, I've negotiated with bears.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.233
It's much more tiresome than it sounds.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.637
I've fought Tartars,
and that can actually be quite fun.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.433
Does this really interest you?

40:14.560 --> 40:16.153
I am capable of being quite boring
sometimes.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.271
No, no, no, no.
Where the North is concerned,

40:18.400 --> 40:20.118
you could never bore me.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.517
Well, my favourite moment
is early morning,

40:23.640 --> 40:27.952
when the sky is high
and the land seems endless.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.953
All that's in front of you is fresh,
unbroken snow.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.669
You feel utterly alone...

40:37.120 --> 40:41.239
...and you feel utterly magnificent.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.715
I want to feel like that.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.871
Take a seat, Lyra.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.990
Lyra, do you know why I'm here?

40:55.120 --> 40:58.078
The Master has asked if I can find
a place for you,

40:58.200 --> 41:01.477
and, naturally,
I wanted to meet you first.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.235
And now that I've met you, I like you,

41:05.360 --> 41:10.070
and I want to offer you
a position as my assistant.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.352
Now, you'll need to learn fast,
and I won't take any slacking,

41:13.480 --> 41:17.951
but I think with your enthusiasm
and my know-how,

41:18.080 --> 41:19.798
we could make quite the team.

41:19.920 --> 41:23.515
- We'd go to the North?
- Well, we'll go to London first,

41:23.640 --> 41:26.712
and you'd have to be prepared
to leave tomorrow.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.593
I have an airship booked
for the both of us.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.953
My friend Roger - can he come too?

41:34.080 --> 41:38.153
He's not much of an explorer,
but he can cook and clean and...

41:38.280 --> 41:39.679
The boy in the dining hall?

41:39.800 --> 41:42.269
But I have all the household staff
that I need, Lyra...

41:42.400 --> 41:43.515
He won't let you down.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.199
I need him.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.833
He's my best friend.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.633
My only friend.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.797
Please. He's an orphan like me,

41:50.920 --> 41:53.719
and leaving Jordan College would be
the most exciting thing for us.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.877
Fine. He can come.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.071
(MRS COULTER LAUGHS) Oh!

42:07.520 --> 42:10.478
PAN: Lyra, stop and think
before you tell him.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.831
There is a chance he may not want to go.
Jordan College is all he knows.

42:13.960 --> 42:18.477
It's all I know too. But we were always
going to leave Jordan College, Pan.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.716
- Roger isn't like you.
- We'll explain it to him tomorrow.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.480
Even he'll know he can't miss this chance.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.159
We can't.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.679
Ma...

43:03.800 --> 43:06.519
(MA SOBS)

43:11.320 --> 43:12.913
My Billy...

43:13.040 --> 43:16.078
- My Billy...
- Ma, it's all right.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.274
It's all right.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.357
(BELL CHIMES)

43:25.400 --> 43:27.437
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

43:27.560 --> 43:28.789
Is it safe to...?

43:28.920 --> 43:30.433
- (LYRA GROANS)
- May 1...?

43:30.560 --> 43:32.358
Librarian?

43:33.520 --> 43:35.318
Who were you expecting at this hour?

43:35.440 --> 43:37.397
Roger with my breakfast.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.079
What are you doing here?

43:39.200 --> 43:40.838
You're needed.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.997
Rather urgently, as it happens.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.714
Well, quickly, Lyra, get dressed.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.153
Ah, good girl, come quickly.
We haven't long.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.511
I'm leaving Jordan to live with
Mrs Coulter and Roger, and no-one...

43:54.640 --> 43:56.472
And no-one is stopping you.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.432
You know about that?

43:58.560 --> 44:00.676
Mrs Coulter has spoken to me, yes.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.916
I arranged it all myself.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.351
The part of your life that belongs to
Jordan College is coming to an end.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.118
Now please sit.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.595
So, why am I here, then?

44:13.720 --> 44:16.439
Lyra, I promised once to do
everything I could

44:16.560 --> 44:18.437
to protect you from anyone who might
do you harm.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.914
Protect me?

44:20.040 --> 44:21.519
From what?

44:23.000 --> 44:24.638
And the older you've got,

44:24.760 --> 44:28.435
the more I've felt the importance
of that promise.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.994
Who did you promise?

44:30.120 --> 44:35.752
I think Mrs Coulter will do her best
by you,

44:35.880 --> 44:37.314
but I can't be sure.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.909
So I'm going to give you something,

44:40.040 --> 44:45.592
and I need you to promise that
you will keep it private.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.038
This matters, Lyra.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.594
We need your word.

45:00.320 --> 45:01.833
What is it?

45:03.680 --> 45:05.432
It's an alethiometer.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.200
One of only six that were ever made.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.074
It's beautiful.

45:13.200 --> 45:16.352
Lord Asriel himself brought it
to this college

45:16.480 --> 45:18.596
when you were just a baby.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.072
It's extraordinary.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.430
What does it do?

45:27.560 --> 45:29.517
It tells you the truth.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.515
How?

45:32.640 --> 45:35.154
That, Pan and you will
have to learn by yourselves.

45:37.080 --> 45:40.516
But please know that it is illegal unless
approved by the Magisterium,

45:40.640 --> 45:44.315
- SO secrecy is...
- No, no, no, I don't want secrets.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.000
It's my uncle's.
He wouldn't want me to have it anyway.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.758
Lyra, look at me!

45:48.880 --> 45:51.030
The powers of this world are very strong.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.754
Men and women are moved by tides
much fiercer than you can imagine.

45:53.880 --> 45:58.829
This hopefully will provide you
with some protection.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.679
Go well, Lyra.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.429
Goodbye, Lyra.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.355
And...

46:13.000 --> 46:15.230
...keep your own counsel.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.998
Not a word to anyone,

46:17.120 --> 46:18.952
not even Mrs Coulter.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.151
We need to tell Roger
we're going to London.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.272
I'm looking for Roger.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.755
So am I.
He didn"t turn up for the breakfast shift.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.553
Roger?

46:43.840 --> 46:45.717
Mrs Woodbridge, have you seen Roger?

46:45.840 --> 46:48.275
- No, I haven't.
- Any of you?

46:48.400 --> 46:49.754
- I've not seen him.
- No.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.274
- Mr Cousins, have you seen Roger?
- No.

46:55.400 --> 46:56.993
Roger?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.071
- Eric, have you seen Roger?
- No.

47:03.960 --> 47:06.270
Roger!

47:11.920 --> 47:15.959
- This is the last place he'd be.
- There's nowhere else to look.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.674
(SCREAMS) Roger!

47:25.600 --> 47:27.910
Are you down here?

47:28.040 --> 47:30.839
You don't think the Gobblers
have got him, do you?

47:58.400 --> 47:59.720
Readying the boats?

47:59.840 --> 48:03.231
Are you thinking of leaving,
Farder Coram? My son's still out there.

48:03.360 --> 48:07.797
Farder Coram has done nothing.
I am halting the search.

48:13.080 --> 48:17.039
You may be the western king,
but my son is worth more than...

48:17.160 --> 48:18.833
The children call them Gobblers.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.951
There's nothing saying he's with them.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.798
There's nothing saying they even exist.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.513
Billy's a good boy.

48:25.680 --> 48:30.038
He's strong, because you have been
a strong and good mother to him, Maggie.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.913
And if he could,
he'd have found his way back to us.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.838
But he has not.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.519
He's just...

48:36.640 --> 48:38.358
...Lost his way,

48:38.480 --> 48:40.391
and he needs us to find him.

48:40.520 --> 48:44.229
They've taken 16 of our children so far,
and that number keeps growing.

48:44.360 --> 48:47.671
Searching for him here, when we know he
is lost, is foolishness and you know it!

48:47.800 --> 48:49.518
We're going to London,

48:49.640 --> 48:51.472
we will fight those Gobblers

48:51.600 --> 48:53.557
and get our children back.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.912
Come on.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.350
Good! You're early. I like early.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.312
My friend Roger, he's gone missing,
I can't find him anywhere.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.159
This isn't like him.
Something's happened.

49:16.280 --> 49:19.432
What do you mean?
You seem worried, Lyra. Tell me.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.758
I know the Gobblers are just...

49:22.880 --> 49:24.917
- Ssh.
- ...children's stories, but...

49:26.000 --> 49:27.274
Not here, Lyra.

49:27.400 --> 49:30.870
But one of the Gyptian children,
Billy Costa,

49:31.000 --> 49:32.479
he's gone missing.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.955
They say it's the Gobblers, so...

49:35.080 --> 49:39.199
With every child's nightmare
there's an element of truth, Lyra.

49:39.320 --> 49:43.917
You're saying the Gobblers could be real?
They could have Roger?

49:44.040 --> 49:45.474
He was right?

49:45.600 --> 49:48.160
- It is possible.
- Then we should call the State Police...

49:48.280 --> 49:49.759
No, no, no, no.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.473
They'll be of no use at all.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.194
The State Police wouldn't care about
a kitchen boy.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.152
He'll be miles away by now.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.193
Lyra, listen to me.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.839
Do you care for this boy?

50:02.960 --> 50:04.189
Yes.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.355
Does he care for you?

50:05.480 --> 50:06.550
Yes.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.114
Right.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.709
Then we'll need to take the matter
into our own hands.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.634
The Gobblers will have taken him
to London.

50:14.760 --> 50:17.195
I'll set down tracks as soon as we arrive.

50:17.320 --> 50:20.517
- The Gobblers are in London?
- Yeah, of course they're in London.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.278
Oxford's too small.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.552
In London, children can just...

50:26.600 --> 50:28.432
...disappear.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.631
In Oxford, there's nowhere to hide.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.717
In London, there's everywhere.

50:32.840 --> 50:34.035
And you'll help find him?

50:34.160 --> 50:35.480
Lyra, look at me.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.113
I won't just help.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.230
I won't just try.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.794
I'll succeed.

50:42.720 --> 50:46.600
Your luggage, ma'am.
- Right, I'm on the eight o'clock airship.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.154
I expect to see you there.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.552
For your sake and for Roger's.

50:52.680 --> 50:55.752
Lyra, the gift the Master gave you.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.071
What did he say this did?
Tell the truth.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.472
Tell me where Roger is.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.389
Come on.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.591
Tell me where I can find Roger.

51:15.720 --> 51:19.395
The airship is about to leave.
If we're going, we have to go now.

51:19.520 --> 51:22.034
Tell me if the Gobblers have Roger.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.192
(GASPS) If the Gobblers have him...

51:28.320 --> 51:29.913
...she's our...

51:30.960 --> 51:32.951
...best chance of getting him back.

51:34.520 --> 51:35.999
Isn't she?

51:36.120 --> 51:37.713
Wait!

51:43.960 --> 51:45.359
(ENGINES WHIR)

51:57.640 --> 52:00.234
Lyra, I am so glad
you decided to join me.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.636
Here, come, take a seat.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.116
I think it's the best decision
for both of us.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.196
So, where do we start looking for Roger?

52:11.320 --> 52:15.234
(WHISPERS) Lyra, airships aren't
safe spaces to talk. Ssh.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.794
But we need to start thinking about
where to...

52:16.920 --> 52:18.399
We're together now.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.909
We'll have plenty of time
to discuss whatever you wish.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.470
A bit of quiet now would be best.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.678
The Gyptians.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.757
They're leaving too?

53:11.800 --> 53:13.518
Let me out!
