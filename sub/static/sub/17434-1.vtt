03:26.739 --> 03:29.799
Ezra, come and sit down.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.310
Nothing's going to happen
on a night like this.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.676
Drink up, man.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.307
No. That's what he wants.
Can you not see that?

03:36.349 --> 03:38.749
- But the storm...
- Damn the storm.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.116
Come on, Micah.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.287
Come on and have
a drink with us.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.427
Look!

03:57.804 --> 03:59.965
Fetch our hats.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.440
Tell the others to wait.
Quick, man!

04:41.347 --> 04:42.746
Come on.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.458
Do you believe me now,
Micah Smith?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.959
Now that you've seen
with your own eyes...

05:27.994 --> 05:29.552
do you believe me
when I tell you...

05:29.595 --> 05:30.926
that's the home
of Satan himself?

05:30.963 --> 05:32.658
Aye, aye.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.132
Then come.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.245
Somebody get hay!
Make sure it's dry!

08:04.283 --> 08:06.911
And bring some oil!
Come on, let's go!

08:40.720 --> 08:42.278
Kill the warlock!

08:42.321 --> 08:45.017
Open this door!
Open this door!

08:45.057 --> 08:47.025
Curwen!

08:49.896 --> 08:50.863
Well?

08:50.897 --> 08:52.865
- Where is she?
- Who?

08:52.899 --> 08:55.299
You know who. The Fitch girl.
Do you deny she's here?

08:55.334 --> 08:58.098
Certainly not.
She visits us frequently.

08:58.137 --> 09:01.504
Don't you, Miss Fitch?
Don't you?

09:04.510 --> 09:05.875
Yes.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.880
Of your own free will?

09:07.914 --> 09:10.109
Yes.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.982
- There now, Mr. Weeden...
- Just a moment.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.509
What's your name, girl?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.647
- Really, this is outrageous!
- Quiet!

09:16.689 --> 09:19.249
Your name, child.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.792
You see?
He's taken her mind, her soul...

09:26.832 --> 09:29.027
the good Lord knows what else...
just like the others.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.558
What do we do about it?

09:30.603 --> 09:32.468
Let him go on
with his black magic...

09:32.505 --> 09:34.234
or send him back
to the hell he came from?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.639
- Send him back!
- Then let's be about it!

09:39.011 --> 09:40.740
No, not the woman.
Leave her be.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.680
She's been hexed.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.619
It'll be right with us again...

09:47.653 --> 09:49.143
when he's gone, Hester.
You'll see.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.360
- Send him back to Hades!
- Burn him!

09:59.398 --> 10:01.059
Back where he comes from!

10:01.100 --> 10:03.466
Burn him! Burn him!

10:11.277 --> 10:13.336
Have you anything
to say, warlock?

10:13.379 --> 10:14.744
Only this...

10:14.780 --> 10:17.044
As surely
as the village of Arkham...

10:17.083 --> 10:19.984
has risen up against me...

10:20.019 --> 10:25.821
so shall I rise from the dead
against the village of Arkham.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.382
Each one of you!

10:27.426 --> 10:31.954
Ezra Weeden,
Micah Smith...

10:31.998 --> 10:34.660
Benjamin West...

10:34.700 --> 10:37.100
Priam Willet...

10:37.136 --> 10:39.764
Gideon Leach...

10:39.805 --> 10:43.104
all of you and your children
and your children's children...

10:43.142 --> 10:47.602
shall have just cause to regret
the actions of this night.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.514
For from this night onward...

10:50.549 --> 10:55.077
you shall bear my curse.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.918
Burn the devil.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.787
Burn him!

11:34.427 --> 11:37.863
"And travelers, now,
within that valley...

11:37.897 --> 11:39.888
"through the red-litten
windows see...

11:39.932 --> 11:44.096
"vast forms,
that move fantastically...

11:44.136 --> 11:47.003
"to a discordant melody."

12:02.655 --> 12:04.520
Whoa, horse.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.165
There you are, ma'am. Careful.

12:18.270 --> 12:22.138
Thank you, Mr. Carmody.
It was a most enjoyable trip.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.163
Aye.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.473
Thank you.

12:26.946 --> 12:30.074
It isn't often I get
passengers for Arkham.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.913
Begging you pardon, sir...

12:31.951 --> 12:34.442
did you say you were going
to be staying here long?

12:34.487 --> 12:35.954
Why do you ask?

12:35.988 --> 12:39.981
Arkham is an evil place.
The village is cursed.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.516
Don't tell us
you're superstitious.

12:42.561 --> 12:45.462
Not at all.
And I'm not a coward, either...

12:45.498 --> 12:48.058
but you couldn't pay me
to spend a night in this place.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.160
Why not? Ghosts? Spirits?

12:51.203 --> 12:53.330
Perhaps.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.839
I'm sorry, sir...

12:54.874 --> 12:56.808
but we don't happen to believe
in the supernatural.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.504
And I don't think
you do, either. Good-bye.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.911
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.276
And good luck.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.025
It looks cursed.
I'll give it that.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.298
Where are the people?

13:25.337 --> 13:27.134
I can't imagine.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.989
Look. The "Burning Man."

13:46.025 --> 13:47.720
Isn't that quaint?

13:49.028 --> 13:51.326
Yes, very quaint.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.354
It is.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.766
Where else would you find
a tavern with a name like that?

14:27.433 --> 14:31.665
We were trying to find
a certain house here in town...

14:31.704 --> 14:33.433
and we thought perhaps
you could help us.

14:33.472 --> 14:36.305
- Whose house is it?
- Ours.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.640
I know that sounds silly.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.668
It belonged
to the Curwen family.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.408
We inherited it.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.110
- Curwen, you say?
- Yes, that's right.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.449
I don't know of any such house.

14:49.788 --> 14:53.417
All right. Thank you anyway.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.594
Just a minute.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.860
Why do you want to know
about the Curwen place?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.166
Because it belongs to us.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.035
Your name is Curwen?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.006
No, our name is Ward.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.133
Then...?

15:10.175 --> 15:12.837
Joseph Curwen was
my great-great-grandfather.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.574
Can you tell us
where the house is?

15:15.614 --> 15:17.605
I can, but I won't.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.586
That's what I like
about you New Englanders...

15:21.620 --> 15:23.918
you're so friendly.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.514
Come, Ann.
We'll find it oursel...

15:25.557 --> 15:27.957
Mr. Ward! Don't go there.

15:27.993 --> 15:31.520
It isn't a house. It's
a madman's palace as old as sin.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.929
Palace? In America?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.661
Brought over stone by stone.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.225
Brought over from where?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.567
Europe somewhere. No one knows.
No one wants to know.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.302
But if you value your lives,
don't go there.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.707
Why not?

15:44.743 --> 15:46.677
What Edgar...
Mr. Weeden means is...

15:46.712 --> 15:49.010
that place is a ruin.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.245
It hasn't been occupied
in over 100 years.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.845
Is that what you mean?

15:59.491 --> 16:02.119
- What a strange man.
- Yes.

16:03.862 --> 16:07.263
He has had a bit,
but what he says is right.

16:07.299 --> 16:11.633
Mr. Ward,
Mrs. Ward, please...

16:11.670 --> 16:13.399
do yourself a kindness.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.169
Go back to wherever
you came from...

16:16.208 --> 16:18.676
and forget you ever heard
about Arkham.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.872
And what do you recommend
I do with the deed?

16:20.913 --> 16:23.347
- Just tear it up?
- Yes.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.612
Just tear up the deed
to a palace I've inherited...

16:25.651 --> 16:27.050
and forget all about it...

16:27.086 --> 16:28.678
without so much
as laying eyes on the property.

16:28.721 --> 16:33.021
- Is that your advice?
- It's more than advice.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.925
Come on, Ann.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.519
Mr. Ward...

16:41.066 --> 16:43.796
Take the road out of town
about a quarter of a mile.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.532
At the post road, turn left
past the cemetery.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.063
You shouldn't have
too much difficulty finding it.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.666
Here, I'll show you.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.819
There's the Curwen palace
over there on the cliff.

17:05.523 --> 17:09.460
We certainly want to thank you
for being so nice, Mr...

17:09.494 --> 17:11.792
Willet. I'm a doctor.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.798
My office is down the street,
in case you need me.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.561
I don't think we'll be staying
very long, doctor.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.297
You've decided that already?

17:18.337 --> 17:21.431
It seems to have been
decided for us.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.771
Thank you, anyway.
Come, Ann.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.003
Thank you.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.966
What do you think?

17:52.004 --> 17:53.596
It's him, right enough...
the devil himself.

17:53.639 --> 17:54.697
Nonsense.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.867
- And you helped him.
- As I'd help any stranger.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.342
He's no stranger,
and you know it.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.470
I don't know anything
of the kind, and neither do you.

18:00.512 --> 18:01.604
Are you blind?

18:01.647 --> 18:02.978
Or do you tell me you've
never seen that face before?

18:03.015 --> 18:05.506
I'll admit there's
a strong resemblance...

18:05.551 --> 18:07.542
but that's a matter
of heredity, not magic.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.555
Call it what you will.
One thing is certain...

18:10.589 --> 18:13.149
Joseph Curwen
has come back to Arkham.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.926
- Why did you say that?
- What?

18:16.962 --> 18:18.589
That we wouldn't
be staying long.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.292
Do you want to stay in a town
full of fools like that?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.960
I don't think
Dr. Willet was a fool.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.401
All right, so Dr. Willet
wasn't a fool...

18:45.424 --> 18:47.654
The poor thing.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.684
Yes.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.094
Let's get this over with.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.020
Charles, it's you!

21:06.164 --> 21:08.860
It's absolutely fantastic!

21:16.908 --> 21:18.671
Dear, is something wrong?

21:20.512 --> 21:21.843
No.

21:23.682 --> 21:29.348
No. Let's see what the rest
of this mausoleum looks like.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.583
Kitchen's over there.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.985
Wait.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.988
That doesn't lead anywhere.
This way.

22:37.022 --> 22:41.550
- How would you know that?
- Just a guess.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.117
I'll let some light in here.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.522
Good evening.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.930
- Who are you?
- My name is Simon.

23:57.969 --> 24:00.233
What are you doing here?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.899
I'm the caretaker.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.135
I was preparing your room.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.440
In the dark?

24:06.478 --> 24:10.278
One becomes accustomed
to the darkness here.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.525
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ward,
if I startled you...

24:21.560 --> 24:23.926
but I didn't know
you'd be here so soon.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.089
Just a minute.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.998
How is it you
expected us at all?

24:29.034 --> 24:32.367
Your attorney,
Mr. Hutchinson, contacted me.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.862
Since then, I've been preparing
the palace for your arrival.

24:35.907 --> 24:38.569
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go fetch your bags.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.704
No! No, that won't
be necessary.

24:41.746 --> 24:42.770
We're not staying.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.840
But where would you
spend the night?

24:48.119 --> 24:51.987
After all, Mr. Ward,
this is your home.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.089
Get the bags.

24:57.095 --> 24:58.494
Very well.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.931
Dinner will be served at 8:00,
if that's convenient.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.094
Thank you.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.615
You don't really want
to spend the night here?

25:24.656 --> 25:28.353
No, of course not, but...

25:29.728 --> 25:31.787
But the old fellow was right.

25:31.830 --> 25:36.995
We have to spend the night
someplace. Don't we?

25:51.416 --> 25:55.978
Quiet! Quiet I say!

25:56.021 --> 25:57.886
Is it food you want?

26:31.957 --> 26:34.050
What's wrong with him tonight?

26:34.092 --> 26:36.219
Not him, woman, it! Lt!

26:36.261 --> 26:38.593
How many times must I tell you?

26:38.630 --> 26:41.963
It knows.
That's what's wrong.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.901
It knows who's
come back to Arkham.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.833
I'm all packed.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.872
You ready?

28:36.514 --> 28:39.972
- I have decided to stay.
- What?

28:40.018 --> 28:42.316
Just long enough
to fix the place up.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.287
With a little work,
it could bring a good price.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.619
Don't you think?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.619
I should imagine. I don't know.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.152
I estimate two weeks,
perhaps three...

28:52.197 --> 28:54.461
to get things started, anyway.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.160
Do you mind?

28:56.201 --> 29:01.639
No, not exactly.
I can't say it pleases me.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.038
Then you go home.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.304
I'm sorry.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.446
It's just that I...

29:14.953 --> 29:17.945
I can't leave now until I...

29:17.989 --> 29:22.119
find out... some things.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.486
Nightmarish, yes,
but not a nightmare.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.495
They're quite real,
I'm sorry to say.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.520
But what are they, doctor?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.465
Human beings.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.934
Very unfortunate human beings.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.937
They were born mutated.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.336
You see, Mrs. Ward,

31:48.373 --> 31:51.001
it requires an extraordinary
combination of elements...

31:51.042 --> 31:53.010
to form a normal person.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.444
In their case,
the combination was wrong.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.846
They were gathered
by Weeden, of course...

31:57.882 --> 31:59.679
for the purpose
of frightening you away.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.116
But why, doctor?

32:01.152 --> 32:03.950
Why should we be treated
as though we have the plague?

32:03.988 --> 32:06.980
Because you do.
To these people, at any rate.

32:07.025 --> 32:10.256
Understand, Mr. Ward,
Arkham is a strange community.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.956
You see, it's haunted.

32:11.996 --> 32:14.362
Not by ghosts,
but haunted nonetheless.

32:14.399 --> 32:18.961
By fear, by guilt...

32:19.003 --> 32:21.995
and by the memory
of a particular night.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.476
Particular night?

32:25.510 --> 32:28.479
But what has this to do with us?

32:28.513 --> 32:31.914
You see, 150 years ago...

32:31.950 --> 32:34.748
a man named Joseph Curwen
moved to this village...

32:34.786 --> 32:36.310
and built this palace.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.983
His first wife died
in childbirth, so he selected...

32:40.024 --> 32:42.083
the most beautiful woman
in the village...

32:42.126 --> 32:43.991
and took her for his mistress.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.326
Unfortunately,
she was engaged to marry...

32:46.364 --> 32:49.527
an Arkhamite named Ezra Weeden.
No, thank you.

32:49.567 --> 32:52.502
You spoke with
his descendent yesterday.

32:52.537 --> 32:55.597
- The man at the inn.
- Yes.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.665
According to legend,
a number of strange things...

32:57.709 --> 33:00.109
occurred when Curwen
moved into the village.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.408
Terrible noises
were heard in the night.

33:02.447 --> 33:03.937
Thank you.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.917
Young girls were said to have
disappeared from their homes...

33:06.951 --> 33:08.316
to be gone until dawn...

33:08.353 --> 33:12.187
and then reappear with no memory
of their whereabouts.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.952
Weeden wasted no time...

33:13.992 --> 33:17.519
in placing the blame
directly on this doorstep.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.462
He and his coterie of friends...

33:19.497 --> 33:21.362
claimed that Curwen
was a warlock.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.366
Warlock?

33:22.400 --> 33:25.301
Yes. One who
conjures up the dead.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.770
They demanded punishment.

33:27.805 --> 33:30.467
And one night
the people of the village...

33:30.508 --> 33:32.772
marched on the palace...

33:32.810 --> 33:36.974
dragged your ancestor
into the yard, and burned him.

33:37.015 --> 33:41.509
Burned him?
The "Burning Man."

33:43.421 --> 33:45.753
That explains the guilt.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.224
What about the fear?

33:48.259 --> 33:50.819
Curwen put a curse
on the village.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.387
He vowed that he'd return.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.127
You can see
the resemblance yourself.

33:56.167 --> 33:59.500
I'm sure that
every warlock or witch...

33:59.537 --> 34:02.734
who died in America
left a curse.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.607
Why should Curwen's
be taken so seriously?

34:05.643 --> 34:07.702
Why should it be remembered
after all these years?

34:07.745 --> 34:12.306
I can't say.
He was a strange man.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.318
There were terrible
rumors about him.

34:14.351 --> 34:15.842
Such as?

34:15.887 --> 34:18.947
It was thought that
he had gained possession...

34:18.989 --> 34:21.618
of a book
called the Necronomicon.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.286
Have you heard of it?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.090
No.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.757
It obviously never existed...

34:27.799 --> 34:29.790
except in the minds
of the superstitious.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.132
But they claimed
it held enough secrets...

34:32.170 --> 34:35.969
to give a man absolute power.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.737
Of course, every mythology
has such a book...

34:39.777 --> 34:43.975
but the Necronomicon
supposedly contained formulas...

34:44.014 --> 34:46.483
through which one
could communicate with...

34:46.516 --> 34:49.179
or even summon the elder gods...

34:49.219 --> 34:53.554
the dark ones from beyond
who had once ruled the world...

34:53.591 --> 34:55.491
and now are merely waiting...

34:55.525 --> 34:58.495
for an opportunity
to regain that control.

34:58.529 --> 35:02.431
Cthulhu, Yog-sothoth.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.935
Dreadful rubbish, I know.

35:04.969 --> 35:08.427
Still, the people
of Arkham believed it.

35:08.473 --> 35:12.933
They claimed that Joseph Curwen
and two other warlocks...

35:12.977 --> 35:16.174
were trying to open the gates
to these dark gods.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.978
Open the gates? How?

35:19.016 --> 35:21.314
They claimed that
Joseph Curwen was trying...

35:21.352 --> 35:26.483
to mate those beings with humans
to create a new race...

35:26.524 --> 35:28.992
through which the gods
could regain their control.

35:29.026 --> 35:33.463
That's how they explained
the mutated births...

35:33.498 --> 35:35.966
unsuccessful experiments
passed on...

35:36.000 --> 35:39.595
from generation to generation,
carried in the blood.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.663
What's your
explanation, doctor?

35:42.707 --> 35:44.106
I don't have one.

35:44.142 --> 35:48.374
I advise you
to leave this village.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.380
I advise you to flee it...

35:50.414 --> 35:52.848
as you would from
a madman with a knife...

35:52.884 --> 35:56.786
who feels compelled
to destroy you...

35:56.821 --> 35:59.790
before you can destroy him.

38:32.476 --> 38:36.606
It's a cold night, sir.
You'll need your coat.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.945
Thank you.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.441
You seem troubled, sir.
Is something wrong?

38:42.486 --> 38:44.511
You didn't hear them?

38:44.555 --> 38:46.022
Beg your pardon?

38:46.057 --> 38:48.617
The voices? People?

38:48.659 --> 38:50.058
No, sir.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.692
Must have been the wind.

38:53.731 --> 38:57.258
Perhaps you should ask
Mr. Curwen.

38:57.301 --> 39:00.168
- Curwen?
- Yes.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.266
Maybe he could tell you.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.861
Welcome, Joseph.

39:27.898 --> 39:31.664
Simon. How long?

39:31.702 --> 39:34.170
110 years.

39:34.205 --> 39:38.938
110 years?

39:38.976 --> 39:42.571
And whose body is this
I'm now occupying?

39:42.613 --> 39:46.743
His name is
Charles Dexter Ward.

39:46.784 --> 39:50.447
My great-great-grandson.
Perfect.

39:50.488 --> 39:54.481
All the others were useless.
You would not accept them.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.288
No matter.

39:56.327 --> 39:59.956
- Where's Jabez?
- Here, Joseph.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.499
Jabez, my old friend.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.735
We three...

40:09.774 --> 40:12.971
together again.

40:13.010 --> 40:16.969
But... briefly, I fear.

40:17.014 --> 40:21.280
I shan't be able
to hold him much longer.

40:21.318 --> 40:24.981
He fights me.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.490
When will you have full control?

40:27.525 --> 40:29.652
Soon, Simon.

40:29.693 --> 40:33.561
Keep him here
for a while longer...

40:33.597 --> 40:36.122
and he will be all mine.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.434
He has my blood.

40:40.471 --> 40:43.031
I can feel it.

40:45.409 --> 40:47.036
The book.

40:47.077 --> 40:48.977
The book!

40:49.013 --> 40:50.503
Good.

40:50.548 --> 40:54.006
Good.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.815
Now leave me, my friends.

40:56.854 --> 40:59.755
He fights me.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.691
He fights to leave me.

41:14.738 --> 41:18.640
What is it?
What's the matter?

41:18.676 --> 41:21.076
Dear, what are you
doing down here?

41:26.016 --> 41:28.985
I don't know.

41:29.019 --> 41:31.954
I must have walked in my sleep.

41:31.989 --> 41:36.119
Please, dear, let's leave here
now, tonight.

41:36.160 --> 41:41.792
I want to, but... I can't.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.959
Why not?

41:46.036 --> 41:47.503
Why not?

42:04.355 --> 42:06.346
Over a whole week
he's been there...

42:06.390 --> 42:08.153
and what's he been doing?

42:08.192 --> 42:10.956
That's what I want to know.
What's he been doing?

42:10.995 --> 42:12.428
Getting ready, that's what.

42:12.463 --> 42:15.091
And meanwhile,
we sit here like sheep.

42:15.132 --> 42:19.125
Willet, I thought
you said he'd be gone.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.000
I thought he would be...

42:21.038 --> 42:23.006
but you made him feel
so welcome...

42:23.040 --> 42:24.871
he's probably decided
to stay for good.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.275
Go on, sneer.
You can afford to.

42:27.311 --> 42:29.506
You have no halfwitted thing
locked in your attic...

42:29.547 --> 42:31.105
and no woman
to worry about, either.

42:31.148 --> 42:34.447
I've got this whole town
to worry about.

42:34.485 --> 42:37.045
The man you fear is dead!

42:37.087 --> 42:39.112
Can't you fools get that
through your heads?

42:39.156 --> 42:41.021
He died over 100 years ago.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.993
He can't harm you or your women.

42:44.028 --> 42:46.553
Don't you forget, doctor...

42:46.597 --> 42:49.760
that the man who died
over 100 years ago...

42:49.800 --> 42:51.961
he did this!

42:54.405 --> 42:58.034
And now... he's back
with us again.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.701
He'll be doing more.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.804
Unless we stop him.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.996
- Where have you been?
- Out walking.

43:53.030 --> 43:55.555
- At this time of night?
- Yes, at this time of night!

43:55.599 --> 43:58.591
Must I report my movements
to you like a schoolboy?

43:58.636 --> 44:01.161
- No, of course not...
- Then mind your own business.

44:04.975 --> 44:08.638
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing whatsoever.

44:08.679 --> 44:13.548
No, you've changed.
I've never seen you like this.

44:17.421 --> 44:21.448
If you won't go back to Boston,
at least let me call Dr. Willet.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.960
No.

44:23.994 --> 44:28.795
I shall be calling on Dr. Willet
personally within the week.

44:28.832 --> 44:31.767
Now, are you satisfied?

44:31.802 --> 44:34.862
- Yes.
- Then go back to bed!

44:34.905 --> 44:37.271
What will you be doing?

44:37.307 --> 44:39.969
That is not your concern.
Good night.

44:41.578 --> 44:43.375
Good night.

45:11.975 --> 45:13.966
Leave me alone.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.614
Leave me alone!

45:17.648 --> 45:19.843
I will never leave you alone.

45:19.883 --> 45:23.182
Your blood is my blood,
your mind is my mind...

45:23.220 --> 45:25.154
your body, my body.

45:25.189 --> 45:27.680
It will do you no good
to resist me.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.455
Your efforts
grow weaker every day.

45:30.494 --> 45:33.952
No. No!

45:33.997 --> 45:36.898
You cannot keep me out.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.027
My will is too strong.

45:39.069 --> 45:46.942
Too strong for you.
Too strong for you.

45:46.977 --> 45:50.606
- Why are you spying on me?
- I heard voices.

45:50.647 --> 45:53.047
Tomorrow you must leave.
Is that understood?

45:53.083 --> 45:55.347
- Yes.
- Now go to your bed.

46:19.510 --> 46:23.071
- You lost him?
- For a time.

46:23.113 --> 46:27.106
He has a strong will,
stronger than we thought.

46:27.151 --> 46:30.882
But you did well.
He has the Curwen strain.

46:40.998 --> 46:42.659
Hester.

48:08.352 --> 48:10.115
Where are you?

50:28.925 --> 50:31.086
Is that you?

50:43.373 --> 50:45.068
Mrs. Ward.

50:45.108 --> 50:47.906
I heard sounds.

50:47.944 --> 50:50.640
Thought we had prowlers.

51:05.462 --> 51:08.625
- It was his wife.
- Where is she now?

51:08.665 --> 51:10.724
- In her room.
- Did you lock it?

51:10.767 --> 51:12.428
Yes.

51:12.469 --> 51:15.961
Stupid woman. She doesn't know
what it is to love.

51:58.381 --> 52:02.340
It has been too long.

52:02.385 --> 52:06.879
No, we will continue trying.

52:06.923 --> 52:09.824
Yes, as you say.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.158
We'll continue trying.

52:13.997 --> 52:16.830
- Help me upstairs quickly.
- Yes.

52:16.867 --> 52:17.993
Quickly.

52:29.045 --> 52:30.512
I've been so afraid.

52:33.350 --> 52:35.341
What is it? What's happened?
Tell me.

52:35.385 --> 52:39.515
I don't know. It's this house.

52:41.024 --> 52:44.516
I think I must be
going out of my mind.

52:46.029 --> 52:48.657
Where have I been tonight?

52:48.698 --> 52:50.757
Don't you remember?

52:50.800 --> 52:56.534
No. I'm so confused.

52:58.208 --> 53:00.836
We've got to get out of here
before it's too late.

53:00.877 --> 53:02.276
Yes, dear.

53:02.312 --> 53:04.940
Tomorrow morning.

53:04.981 --> 53:06.642
Yes, we will.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.393
- Leaving so soon?
- That's right. Any objections?

53:19.429 --> 53:22.956
Certainly not, sir,
but I can make no plans...

53:22.999 --> 53:25.126
until I know what you want to do
with the palace.

53:25.168 --> 53:27.830
- We're selling it.
- I see.

53:27.871 --> 53:31.272
Sir, could you issue a check
for the week's expenses?

53:31.308 --> 53:33.276
- All right. How much?
- I'll get the receipts.

53:33.310 --> 53:36.143
No, that won't be necessary.
How much? We're in a hurry.

53:36.179 --> 53:38.943
It'll only take a moment, sir.

53:42.519 --> 53:46.512
You go out to the coach.
I'll join you in a minute.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.467
Mrs. Ward.

54:31.501 --> 54:34.470
Doctor, you almost missed us.
We were just leaving.

54:34.504 --> 54:37.905
Very wise decision, particularly
under the circumstances.

54:37.941 --> 54:39.966
What do you mean?
Did something happen?

54:40.010 --> 54:41.978
I'm afraid so.

54:42.012 --> 54:44.572
In fact, I was
on my way to warn you...

54:44.614 --> 54:46.479
but it doesn't matter now.

54:46.516 --> 54:48.984
Doctor, please,
I'd like to know.

54:49.019 --> 54:51.715
There was a rather ugly
occurrence last night.

54:51.755 --> 54:54.724
- In Arkham?
- In the cemetery.

54:54.758 --> 54:57.386
A grave was dug up
and a body stolen.

54:57.427 --> 54:59.327
Nobody knows who did it,
but the people...

54:59.362 --> 55:02.490
as you might well imagine,
are blaming it on your husband.

55:02.532 --> 55:03.897
Why?

55:03.933 --> 55:07.425
The grave that was opened was
that of Hester Tillinghast...

55:07.470 --> 55:09.199
Joseph Curwen's mistress.

55:11.975 --> 55:14.466
And they think Charles...

55:15.812 --> 55:18.110
What's wrong with those people?

55:18.148 --> 55:22.448
They're stupid to the marrow
of their bones.

55:22.485 --> 55:24.953
You know who robbed that grave,
don't you, doctor?

55:24.988 --> 55:26.615
- No.
- They did.

55:26.656 --> 55:27.623
They?

55:27.657 --> 55:29.955
Weeden and his dirty
little friends.

55:29.993 --> 55:33.895
- Why would they do that?
- Why? Isn't it obvious?

55:33.930 --> 55:38.094
To frighten me.
To drive me away from my home.

55:38.134 --> 55:41.194
It's a possibility...

55:41.237 --> 55:43.535
But you don't think I did it,
do you, doctor?

55:43.573 --> 55:47.771
No, but it's a good thing
you're leaving, all the same.

55:49.846 --> 55:51.609
But I'm not leaving.

55:51.648 --> 55:53.479
Charles, you promised.

55:53.516 --> 55:55.984
You can go back
to that village, doctor.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.987
You can go back
and tell those people...

55:58.021 --> 56:01.457
that Charles Dexter Ward
has decided to stay.

56:08.965 --> 56:11.627
How long has he been like this?

56:13.136 --> 56:16.936
It started the first night...

56:16.973 --> 56:21.171
just for a little while,
and then he was himself again.

56:21.211 --> 56:23.111
But it kept happening.

56:23.146 --> 56:25.580
What kept happening?

56:25.615 --> 56:29.642
This... change.

56:29.686 --> 56:33.952
I'm so afraid.
I've never seen him like this.

56:33.990 --> 56:37.949
Mrs. Ward, I want you to tell me
exactly what has happened...

56:37.994 --> 56:40.155
since your arrival in Arkham.

56:41.798 --> 56:44.665
- I have him now.
- Are you sure?

56:44.701 --> 56:46.692
Charles Dexter Ward is dead.

56:46.736 --> 56:50.103
- Then we can begin our work.
- Not quite yet.

56:50.140 --> 56:52.973
There are a few little things
I must do first.

56:53.009 --> 56:55.273
Can't you forget what happened?

56:55.311 --> 56:56.938
Forget?

56:56.980 --> 56:59.380
Forget that my flesh
was burned from my bones...

56:59.416 --> 57:02.180
while I was yet alive? No.

57:02.218 --> 57:05.949
No, this village will pay
for its crime, just as I vowed.

57:05.989 --> 57:08.423
- But the work.
- The work?

57:08.458 --> 57:10.722
There can be no work
without my knowledge.

57:10.760 --> 57:15.459
We've waited 110 years.
We can wait a bit longer.

57:18.501 --> 57:20.196
I'm not an alienist...

57:20.236 --> 57:23.637
but there can be little doubt
as to what's happening.

57:23.672 --> 57:26.573
Your husband is reacting
to the legend of his ancestor.

57:26.609 --> 57:29.737
The attitude of the village,
the remarkable resemblance...

57:29.778 --> 57:31.871
between him and the figure
in the portrait...

57:31.914 --> 57:35.941
the atmosphere of the castle
are all working together...

57:35.985 --> 57:37.384
to cause this aberration.

57:39.255 --> 57:42.486
Then I've got to
find a way to help him.

57:42.525 --> 57:45.016
You're not going back in there?

57:45.060 --> 57:48.552
Yes. What else can I do?
Leave him?

57:49.665 --> 57:52.065
I would advise it.

57:52.101 --> 57:53.762
But, then, of course, you can't.

57:53.802 --> 57:55.497
No.

57:55.538 --> 57:57.529
Promise me one thing...

57:57.573 --> 58:01.202
that you'll contact me
if things get out of hand.

58:01.243 --> 58:05.179
Yes, I will, doctor.
Thank you.

58:22.798 --> 58:24.459
Why have you returned?

58:26.635 --> 58:29.001
Because you need me.

58:29.038 --> 58:31.506
Perhaps you're right.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.303
Come here where I can see you.

58:40.649 --> 58:42.082
Do you love me?

58:43.452 --> 58:45.352
Yes.

58:47.823 --> 58:49.290
Then kiss me.

58:51.160 --> 58:53.788
Why do you hesitate?

58:53.829 --> 58:56.423
Surely a husband
has certain rights.

58:56.465 --> 58:58.330
I demand that you kiss me!

59:06.675 --> 59:09.143
What delights
we'll share, we two!

59:09.178 --> 59:11.738
What tender, intimate delights!

59:21.490 --> 59:23.856
Maybe it was a leprechaun.

59:23.892 --> 59:26.087
It's nothing to laugh at, Bruno.

59:26.128 --> 59:29.791
I say, who but the devil
would do such a thing?

59:29.832 --> 59:33.097
He couldn't have
lifted it alone.

59:33.135 --> 59:37.299
Sure not, but remember
the two that worked with him.

59:37.339 --> 59:38.829
They was never caught.

59:38.874 --> 59:42.401
Aye, or maybe it was Dr. Willet
gave them a hand.

59:42.444 --> 59:45.641
No. Willet's a fool, all right,
but he's one of us.

59:45.681 --> 59:47.273
Remember... it was his
great-great-grandfather...

59:47.316 --> 59:50.410
who helped with the burning.
And yours that held the torch.

59:50.452 --> 59:52.147
And it was yours
that did the burning...

59:52.187 --> 59:53.814
and don't be forgetting that!

59:53.856 --> 59:57.383
Forget it? I'm proud of it!

59:57.426 --> 59:59.724
In fact, I've been thinking
along the same lines myself.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.821
I'll be no part of murdering!

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:07.998
Who said murdering?
Me? Did I say murdering?

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.470
What are you talking about?

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.871
Self-protection.
That's what I'm talking about!

01:00:11.907 --> 01:00:13.772
A man threatens your life
and you have...

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.777
the means to stop him,
what do you do?

01:00:15.811 --> 01:00:17.711
He's done no threatening.

01:00:17.746 --> 01:00:20.214
Not yet, but he will!

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.582
First this unholy business
at the cemetery.

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.587
Next, our women will start
wandering out late at night...

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:28.317
eyes all glassy, bellies filled
with God knows what.

01:00:28.357 --> 01:00:29.324
Then you'll see!

01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:31.622
I say this to you, all of you.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.094
If we do nothing but sit around
and talk about it...

01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:36.529
then we deserve whatever we get!

01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:39.623
Now, good night to you!

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:30.844
Get away!

01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:32.642
Get away, you damned thing!
Get away!

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:08.943
The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:11.509
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

01:03:11.553 --> 01:03:13.987
In this veil of tears...

01:03:23.899 --> 01:03:27.665
We suffer much and sin mightily.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.069
Yet we take solace
in the promise...

01:03:30.105 --> 01:03:32.665
of thy eternal forgiveness.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.608
Amen.

01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:14.836
Have you not gorged
yourself enough on revenge?

01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:18.869
You do not know the extent
of my appetite.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.882
I will not have
my fill of revenge...

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:24.215
until this village
is a graveyard...

01:05:24.252 --> 01:05:27.551
until they have felt,
as I did...

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:31.389
the kiss of fire
on their soft, bare flesh.

01:05:31.426 --> 01:05:33.087
All of them.

01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:36.757
Have patience, my friends.

01:05:38.433 --> 01:05:40.230
Surely after all these years...

01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:44.102
I'm entitled to a few...
small amusements.

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:16.027
What do you want?

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.036
What do I want?

01:06:21.076 --> 01:06:24.045
Merely to exercise
my husbandly prerogative.

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.879
Is there anything
so strange about that?

01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:30.077
- Please...
- "Please"?

01:06:31.586 --> 01:06:33.417
Please what, my dear?

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:37.654
I know.

01:06:39.594 --> 01:06:41.721
You're upset because
I've neglected you.

01:06:41.763 --> 01:06:43.663
That's it, isn't it?

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.566
I've been very busy,
but I'm back now.

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:51.497
We have the whole night
before us!

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.236
Stop it! No!

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.407
Stop! No!

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.519
You fool!

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.647
You stupid, weak little fool!

01:07:33.148 --> 01:07:35.139
It is useless.

01:07:36.651 --> 01:07:40.143
No... I will try again!

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.236
Doctor! Thank God you've come!

01:07:57.672 --> 01:08:00.072
- Why? What's happened?
- I don't know.

01:08:00.108 --> 01:08:02.508
I don't know.
Something terrible!

01:08:02.544 --> 01:08:05.638
- Where is he?
- I...

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.671
Look, Mrs. Ward,
you must calm yourself.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.617
Then you must tell me
everything, sparing no detail.

01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:13.450
Your life and your husband's
may depend upon it.

01:08:13.488 --> 01:08:14.785
Yes, doctor.

01:08:18.126 --> 01:08:22.586
We were up in the bedroom
a short time ago.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:26.590
And then, all of a sudden, he...

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:29.365
Doctor, you've got to help me
get him out of here!

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:31.634
This place is killing him!

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:37.267
Joseph Curwen... he's killing him!

01:08:37.312 --> 01:08:39.303
Look at him.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:47.020
That filthy, horrible
old man! I hate him!

01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:51.416
Mrs. Ward!

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:58.689
I'm sorry, doctor.

01:09:01.169 --> 01:09:03.228
It was a stupid thing to do.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:06.798
Yes, it was.
How are you, doctor?

01:09:08.343 --> 01:09:10.243
Excellent, thank you.

01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:13.441
Glad to hear it.
This is a pleasant surprise.

01:09:13.481 --> 01:09:16.314
- What brings you here?
- Nothing in particular.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.447
- Just looking in?
- That's right. Do you mind?

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:24.082
Mind? No. On the contrary.
I'm delighted...

01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:27.890
and so is my wife.
Aren't you, my dear?

01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:32.059
Here. A little glass of wine
will make you feel better.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.590
I don't want any.

01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:36.763
The doctor and I are going to
have a little chat.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:41.537
So you will just stay
here and rest, eh?

01:09:41.576 --> 01:09:44.511
There you are. Come, doctor.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.448
- She sent for you, of course.
- No, as I was...

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:53.783
There's no need to lie, doctor.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:57.417
In a way, I'm glad. I've been
terribly upset about her.

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:01.190
This house has
a strange effect on her.

01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:02.628
How do you mean?

01:10:02.664 --> 01:10:04.655
You saw how she acted
a moment ago.

01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:06.758
That sort of thing.

01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:10.567
Fits of depression,
anger, hallucinations.

01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:14.473
I hoped it would pass,
but she gets worse every day.

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:15.737
I see.

01:10:15.777 --> 01:10:20.578
I suppose she told you
how... l've begun to change?

01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:22.742
Yes.

01:10:22.784 --> 01:10:24.843
Part of the pattern.

01:10:24.886 --> 01:10:28.117
I scarcely recognize her
anymore, doctor. My own wife.

01:10:28.156 --> 01:10:31.751
What do you want me to do?

01:10:31.793 --> 01:10:34.762
Take her back to Boston.
Get her out of this house.

01:10:34.796 --> 01:10:37.560
Why don't you?

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:40.397
She wouldn't permit it.

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:42.960
She fears me.
Can't you understand?

01:10:43.004 --> 01:10:45.529
Yes, I think I can.

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:49.031
- Then you will help?
- I shall try.

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:53.070
Thank you. I appreciate it.

01:10:53.114 --> 01:10:56.845
But remember... discretion.

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:59.149
She mustn't guess
that you know the truth.

01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:06.887
My dear, I have
a surprise for you.

01:11:06.928 --> 01:11:09.726
You won't have to stay
in this place any longer.

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:12.961
The good doctor is
going to take care of you.

01:11:13.001 --> 01:11:14.662
Dr. Willet!

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:18.730
Yes, it's all arranged.
He will see you to Boston.

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:21.264
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

01:11:21.309 --> 01:11:23.072
Doctor, you don't understand!

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:24.874
Come along, Mrs. Ward.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.404
No! I won't go!

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.110
Please, Mrs. Ward.

01:11:32.954 --> 01:11:34.751
All right.

01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:37.781
You needn't bother to pack.
I'll send your things along.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.157
Good-bye, doctor.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.597
Good-bye, my dear.

01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:47.123
We'll be together again soon.

01:11:49.137 --> 01:11:51.128
I promise.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.385
- What of his woman?
- We're rid of her.

01:12:14.429 --> 01:12:16.590
- Did you...
- No, it was not necessary.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.155
I convinced
the good Dr. Willet...

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:21.225
that she had begun
to lose her mind...

01:12:21.269 --> 01:12:24.067
to imagine strange things...

01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:28.007
even that her own husband
had turned against her.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:29.738
They'll lock her away.

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.803
But if Dr. Willet should return?

01:12:31.846 --> 01:12:33.746
He will learn
that Charles Dexter Ward...

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.580
has retired
to his New England estate.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.586
Do you know of any law
prohibiting a man...

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.020
from residing
on his own property?

01:12:45.293 --> 01:12:47.193
Now, let us begin again.

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:06.604
You can see what happened
to poor Gideon.

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.548
What are we going to
do about it?

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:11.450
Let's do something!

01:13:11.486 --> 01:13:13.613
Let's get him!

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.088
What's happened?

01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:17.387
Don't you really know
what happened, Mrs. Curwen?

01:13:17.425 --> 01:13:20.451
My name is Ward.
No, I don't know.

01:13:20.495 --> 01:13:23.987
- We came to see Gideon.
- Then come and see.

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:32.606
There's Gideon...
and each and every one of us...

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.403
unless we do something about it.

01:13:34.442 --> 01:13:36.910
Just a minute. Do you know
how this happened?

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:39.880
It didn't just happen, doctor.
It was caused to happen.

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:42.280
By whom?
Do you know who did it?

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:44.808
- Aye, and so do you.
- Who?

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.878
The man who swore to do it.

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:50.482
The man you call
Charles Dexter Ward.

01:13:50.525 --> 01:13:52.516
My husband would
never do such a thing!

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.187
She's lying!
They're all in this!

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.629
Mrs. Ward, you better
come along with me.

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.096
- Where are we going?
- Back to the palace.

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:02.103
We've got to get him away from
there before these people...

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.731
decide to take matters
into their own hands.

01:14:47.715 --> 01:14:48.704
Whoa!

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.586
Doctor, I'm going with you!

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.087
Don't be foolish!
Wait here until I come back!

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:56.113
- I'm going with you!
- Then we must hurry!

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.255
- Lucien, you got the ropes?
- Here!

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:04.561
- Elijah?
- Aye!

01:15:04.599 --> 01:15:06.829
All right, then!
Let's be about it!

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.993
Mrs. Ward!

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:13.274
- Did you find him?
- No.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.299
- What about Simon?
- Who?

01:15:15.343 --> 01:15:18.039
- The caretaker.
- I didn't see anyone.

01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:20.547
I know Charles is here!

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:23.415
Is there any more
to the place than we've seen?

01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:25.976
I don't know.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.612
Wait a minute.

01:15:27.655 --> 01:15:29.623
When you tried
to destroy the picture...

01:15:29.657 --> 01:15:33.058
suddenly he was in the room.
Did you see him come in?

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:35.722
- No.
- Neither did I.

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:46.489
Charles Dexter Ward!
Are you down here?

01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:45.212
Don't!

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.016
It's only a book.

01:18:47.054 --> 01:18:49.522
It's much more than a book.

01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:02.663
My God!

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:08.472
- What did you see?
- What a pleasant surprise.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:23.118
Now that you've seen
all of the palace...

01:19:23.157 --> 01:19:25.091
Dr. Willet, what do you
think of it?

01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:29.688
It's quite old, you know...
older than you might imagine.

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:34.929
Torquemada spent many a happy
hour here a few centuries ago.

01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:38.598
- It was old then.
- Mr. Ward...

01:19:38.639 --> 01:19:42.040
I'll admit the furnishings do
leave something to be desired...

01:19:42.076 --> 01:19:46.570
but it has a lived-in quality,
don't you think?

01:19:46.614 --> 01:19:52.450
After all, home
is where the heart is.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.182
Isn't that so, my dear?

01:19:56.023 --> 01:19:57.354
Listen to me!

01:19:57.391 --> 01:20:02.294
I'd be happy to, doctor,
but my friends grow impatient.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.628
Please forgive me.

01:20:04.665 --> 01:20:07.463
May I present
Miss Hester Tillinghast...

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.993
Mr. Simon Orne, and Mr. Jabez
Hutchinson I believe you know.

01:20:10.037 --> 01:20:13.029
They are my associates.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:17.841
You see, we began a project
a few years ago...

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:22.248
but, unfortunately,
it was interrupted...

01:20:22.283 --> 01:20:26.083
and we're most anxious
to take it up again.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.281
What sort of a project?

01:20:28.322 --> 01:20:32.816
The most important
ever attempted of humans...

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:35.328
more important
than you can ever imagine...

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:38.332
and therefore, I fear,
beyond your understanding.

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:46.005
As a matter of fact, we don't
fully understand ourselves.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.272
We obey. That is all.

01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:52.074
We obey.

01:21:00.087 --> 01:21:01.520
Come!

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.356
Come, I said!

01:21:14.368 --> 01:21:17.303
No! Stop!

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.806
What are you doing to her?

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.784
Honoring her, Dr. Willet.

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:06.787
Honoring her.

01:23:07.014 --> 01:23:09.039
Maybe we'll just smoke him out!

01:23:56.897 --> 01:23:59.127
Poor Ann!

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:04.498
You traitor!

01:24:04.538 --> 01:24:06.597
Dr. Willet,
get her away from here!

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.505
Get her away from here,
Dr. Willet!

01:24:08.542 --> 01:24:11.067
Take her away!
Get her away from here!

01:24:40.274 --> 01:24:42.242
- Quickly! Quickly!
- What about Charles?

01:24:42.276 --> 01:24:43.470
I'll come back for him!

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:40.000
They're finished.

01:26:04.391 --> 01:26:06.586
Are you all right?

01:26:06.627 --> 01:26:11.462
Yes... thanks to you
and to my wife.

01:26:11.498 --> 01:26:13.932
I don't know
how I can ever repay you...

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:16.095
for what you've done,
Dr. Willet...

01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:19.799
but I intend to try.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.900
Are you sure you're all right?

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.348
Perfectly sure, my dear.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.345
Perfectly sure.
