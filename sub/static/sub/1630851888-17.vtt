Met my wife and her peoples,
her family and her friends.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.623
It was a--I had fun.
I enjoyed it.

09:10.708 --> 09:12.467
- Did it matter at all--
Because of course,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.052
especially in this situation,

09:14.136 --> 09:17.055
people are very concerned
about first impressions,

09:17.139 --> 09:20.049
and, "What's my partner
gonna think about me?"

09:20.134 --> 09:21.301
- Nope, I don't care.
- You didn't care.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.637
You were just, like--
- I mean, it is who I am.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.390
Like, he might as well get it
on day one.

09:27.474 --> 09:30.893
- So let's talk about
how the two of you have grown

09:30.987 --> 09:33.313
in emotional
and physical intimacy

09:33.397 --> 09:34.731
over the course
of this marriage.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.157
Like, where were you
at the beginning,

09:36.317 --> 09:38.076
and how has it grown into more?

09:38.235 --> 09:39.819
- I mean, I think, for me,
obviously, like,

09:39.912 --> 09:41.246
I wanted to take things slow,

09:41.405 --> 09:43.990
because I wanted to know
who he is as a person.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.409
And I definitely think, when
you get physical too quickly,

09:46.493 --> 09:48.328
then that can kind of
blur other things.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.830
But I think, as we saw, like,

09:50.914 --> 09:53.592
it did not take too much for me
to start being affectionate.

09:53.751 --> 09:55.510
And so I think, for me,
that's gone from, like,

09:55.669 --> 09:58.921
0 to, I want to say, 100
in the course of eight weeks.

09:59.006 --> 10:01.507
- I want to say, like, 45.
- [scoffs]

10:01.592 --> 10:04.269
- And then once you hit 45,
it went to 100.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.511
- Oh, okay.
- But it didn't go

10:05.605 --> 10:06.846
from 0 to 100.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.356
- In eight weeks?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.516
- It didn't go 0 to 100.

10:10.601 --> 10:13.028
- Like, it went 0
the first week, like, 10%--

10:13.187 --> 10:15.188
- 0 the second week,
0 the third week.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.439
[laughter]
- Really?

10:16.523 --> 10:18.107
- And then--
- Go back and see that!

10:18.200 --> 10:21.027
- So--and then after that,

10:21.111 --> 10:23.371
yeah, I would say
you had a little more--

10:23.530 --> 10:24.372
- Sped up, made up for all--
- Yeah.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.041
- Okay.
- So are we saying

10:26.200 --> 10:28.618
that we have progressed
through the entire spectrum

10:28.702 --> 10:31.379
of affectionate
and sexual behavior?

10:31.538 --> 10:35.634
Or are we just stuck on an
enormous amount of smooching?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.219
- No, we have not
consummated the marriage yet.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.712

- Look at your smile.

10:48.722 --> 10:50.390
consummated the marriage
already.

10:50.474 --> 10:53.735

like, two--two weeks ago.

- Aww.

11:02.403 --> 11:05.571
of those things we hope will
come naturally and feel good

11:05.656 --> 11:08.166

11:08.250 --> 11:10.410
and yeah, okay, great, you know.

11:10.494 --> 11:12.170

- Move on.

11:12.329 --> 11:14.339
- I have a question.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.674
Is that your wedding ring?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.759
- No.
I don't like my--

11:17.918 --> 11:20.345

11:27.344 --> 11:29.429

you had mentioned one time

11:29.513 --> 11:30.772
that she's somewhat
of a Negative Nancy.

11:30.931 --> 11:32.440
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell--tell me a little bit

11:32.525 --> 11:34.526
more about that, 'cause I know
that kind of bothers you.

11:34.610 --> 11:38.104
- So that does,
because I'm a very optimistic

11:38.188 --> 11:40.281
and kind of, like,
fun-loving type of person.

11:40.441 --> 11:43.702
So sometimes,
in certain situations,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.945
if it's not going to her liking,

11:46.038 --> 11:49.198
um, her mood can change.

11:49.283 --> 11:53.619
Your moodiness, uh,
puts me in a bad place.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.964
It doesn't make me feel good,
'cause I become negative,

11:56.123 --> 11:58.124
and so-- and I don't like that.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.721
I don't like being mad.
I don't like being dismissive.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.298
I just don't like that--
That energy.

12:05.382 --> 12:07.892
It drains me, and so I just
don't like being like that.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.886
It brings me down.

12:09.970 --> 12:11.146
- I hear you.
Like, I know that's something

12:11.230 --> 12:12.638
that I need to work on,
so it's not, like,

12:12.732 --> 12:14.640
"Oh, my God, I can't believe
he's saying this to me."

12:14.734 --> 12:16.151

that was the first time--

12:16.310 --> 12:17.477

I was like,

12:17.561 --> 12:20.321
"Hmm, I didn't think
about that."

12:20.481 --> 12:22.398
So, like--
- What about your feelings

12:22.491 --> 12:24.150
when you talk
about money with him

12:24.234 --> 12:27.987
and you have different visions

12:28.080 --> 12:32.658

you handle money together?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.495
'Cause I know there's been a
lot of back-and-forth on that.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.413

when we talk about finances

12:37.498 --> 12:40.341
and, like, the future,
it worries me.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.336
- Well, okay, so the biggest
difference between us

12:43.420 --> 12:45.263
when it comes down to that
is she's money-driven

12:45.422 --> 12:47.089

12:47.174 --> 12:49.175
I'm more driven about passion,
about what I like to do.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.427
So if I like to do it,
I'll continue doing it.

12:51.512 --> 12:53.772

about how much it pays.
