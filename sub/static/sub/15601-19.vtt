- Yeah! The game's called,
Pick It, Scratch It, Pop It.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.900
- Games are for the hippies and
demons who penetrate our minds

00:29.000 --> 00:32.767
and suck the juice
from our souls.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.400
- Yeah, anybody can play.

00:37.767 --> 00:40.133

- We got the big nose.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.233
- Whoah, that's amazing.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.933
- Tell me the reason
for a nose so large.

who is that?

00:51.967 --> 00:53.833
- A barber.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.067
- And where did you meet
this barber?

00:56.167 --> 00:57.833
- When I was walking
by the cemetery.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.933
- So, you're a real barber?

01:01.067 --> 01:03.367
- Yes, a barber indeed.

01:03.467 --> 01:06.833

your barber license?

01:06.933 --> 01:09.067
- Back to the cemetery!

01:10.467 --> 01:13.267
- Aw, you guys scared
my barber away.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.400
- That wasn't a real barber.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.167
- Right. Then explain
the scissors.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.133

we got work to do.

- Yes! Let's Pick It,
Scratch It, and Pop It!

01:24.833 --> 01:28.333
- So, what kinda tests
are we doing with this big nose?

01:28.433 --> 01:31.067
- Well, I was thinkin'
we can put a pimple here,

01:31.167 --> 01:32.867
a scab over here,
and then shove some balloons

01:32.967 --> 01:35.067
up this nostril.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.500
- [ laughs ] Shove.

Aw, now that's messed up!

01:48.067 --> 01:49.533
- What's the problem?

01:49.633 --> 01:51.600
- Ow!

01:51.700 --> 01:55.067
The problem is this new
diss track by Big Vicious!

01:55.133 --> 01:57.633

I love his diss tracks!

01:57.733 --> 02:01.433
- Uh, you better not love this
one 'cause it's about my dad.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.900

I'm the king of the game *

02:17.933 --> 02:20.767
* The ladies love me
I make 'em weak in the knees *

02:20.867 --> 02:25.467

- 'Cause Dub had four cavities.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.133
'Cause he won't floss
like I tell him to.

03:07.233 --> 03:10.267

his teeth drilled...

- [ mumbling ]

03:22.900 --> 03:24.467

Ignore it?

and everyone knows it.

So now, Dub's gotta get him back
or else people are gonna think

04:45.200 --> 04:47.600
he's weak. Right?

- Oh, what do I know about
the rules of angry rapping?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.633
- You better go back
to your studio

04:53.733 --> 04:56.533
and make a better diss track
that puts that punk in his place

07:11.467 --> 07:13.833
"Now I'm dating
your ex-girlfriend."

to Double G?
