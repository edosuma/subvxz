WEBVTT

00:02.399 --> 00:04.267
CASSIE: This is me there.

00:04.301 --> 00:06.135
I did all the stunts.

00:06.168 --> 00:08.037
Some of the girls got picked
for their bodies,

00:08.070 --> 00:10.139
which you can see, I had one,

00:10.172 --> 00:12.008
and others for the gymnastics.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.710
But actually, I could do

00:13.743 --> 00:15.612
all the cheers.

00:15.645 --> 00:17.680
Cassie,

00:17.714 --> 00:18.981
these are wonderful photographs.

00:19.015 --> 00:20.016
Thank you.

00:20.049 --> 00:21.484
FRUTT: But you're going on trial

00:21.518 --> 00:22.719
for murder tomorrow,

00:22.752 --> 00:25.422
and I really think we need
to focus on the case.

00:26.723 --> 00:27.857
You said it was important

00:27.890 --> 00:29.492
that the jury feel
they know me a little.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.494
Yes, but whether you did

00:31.528 --> 00:32.795
your own backflips
in high school

00:32.829 --> 00:34.264
isn't relevant.

00:39.135 --> 00:40.169
We also need to meet

00:40.203 --> 00:42.305
with your housekeeper--
Nanny.

00:42.805 --> 00:44.641
Although she might as well be
a housekeeper

00:44.674 --> 00:47.544
since foster care
yanked away my son.

00:48.378 --> 00:50.280
This case could turn
on her testimony,

00:50.313 --> 00:52.482
so--
You think I did it, don't you?

00:52.515 --> 00:54.451
It's not our place
to pass judgment.

00:56.353 --> 00:58.221
What about the New Jersey
incident?

00:58.255 --> 00:59.489
As we explained,

00:59.522 --> 01:00.863
since you weren't
convicted there,

01:00.897 --> 01:02.299
the prosecution can't introduce

01:02.332 --> 01:02.999
it into--
CASSIE: I mean,

01:03.032 --> 01:04.766
do you think I did that one?

01:05.602 --> 01:06.703
I wouldn't know.

01:06.736 --> 01:09.171
I didn't!

01:09.205 --> 01:11.073
It was probably his wife.

01:11.107 --> 01:12.842
She did time in a rubber room,
you know?

01:12.875 --> 01:15.245
And for someone who supposedly
loved her husband,

01:15.278 --> 01:16.813
why wasn't she at the trial?

01:16.846 --> 01:19.015
Loved ones of the victims
always go to trial

01:19.048 --> 01:21.083
to see the murderer get theirs.

01:21.117 --> 01:23.520
Well, perhaps, as you say,

01:23.553 --> 01:25.488
she was the killer,
so she'd feel no need

01:25.522 --> 01:26.556
to see you get yours.

01:29.091 --> 01:31.961
YOUNG: We need to concentrate
on this trial.

01:31.994 --> 01:33.896
Who ran over who seven years ago

01:33.930 --> 01:36.733
in New Jersey isn't relevant.

01:36.766 --> 01:38.701
They're real.

01:38.735 --> 01:39.902
I'm sorry?

01:39.936 --> 01:40.970
My breasts.

01:41.003 --> 01:43.406
I can tell when women
are looking at them to see.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.707
They're real.

01:45.342 --> 01:46.543
So are mine.

01:46.576 --> 01:47.877
Is there a point?

01:48.945 --> 01:51.614
It's just that people think
I'm a fraud.

01:51.648 --> 01:53.283
The police obviously do,

01:53.316 --> 01:54.851
that's why I'm going on trial,
isn't it?

01:54.884 --> 01:56.386
And the jury's gonna think,

01:56.419 --> 01:57.654
"If she'd lie about her tits,

01:57.687 --> 01:59.522
then she'd lie about anything."

01:59.556 --> 02:01.898
Well, they're real.

02:01.931 --> 02:03.666
The jury needs to know it.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.972
(music playing)

02:58.321 --> 02:59.021
WOMAN: This way, please.

02:59.055 --> 03:01.998
(indistinct chatter)

03:03.333 --> 03:04.667
Here you go.
Thank you.

03:06.636 --> 03:07.570
Lindsay Dole.

03:09.005 --> 03:10.139
Ralph Alt. It's a pleasure.

03:10.172 --> 03:11.173
DOLE: Hi.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.775
RALPH: Ed Limato.
How do you do?

03:12.809 --> 03:14.043
DOLE: Nice to meet you.
RALPH: Brian Adams,

03:14.076 --> 03:15.512
Stanley Wells,

03:15.545 --> 03:16.779
and Roland Monroe,

03:16.813 --> 03:18.080
our client.
Pleasure to meet you, Lindsay.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.081
DOLE: Nice to meet you.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.284
Please have a seat.
DOLE: Thank you.

03:21.318 --> 03:23.152
RALPH: I know it was incredibly
short notice.

03:23.185 --> 03:24.721
I appreciate your agreeing
to meet with us.

03:24.754 --> 03:26.022
No problem.

03:28.225 --> 03:29.359
(sighs)

03:29.392 --> 03:32.061
Roland is CEO
of Seaboard Airlines,

03:32.094 --> 03:34.030
a fairly new East Coast
commuter service.

03:34.063 --> 03:35.265
I've heard of it.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.200
RALPH: They're being sued today
in federal court.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.101
The plaintiff,
a prospective passenger,

03:39.135 --> 03:40.203
is seeking a restraining order

03:40.237 --> 03:42.339
to enjoin one of Seaboard's
policies

03:43.473 --> 03:44.707
and we'd like you
to join with us

03:44.741 --> 03:46.609
and actually argue the motion.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.977
We can fully brief you
in all the issues,

03:48.010 --> 03:50.146
which are pretty
straightforward,

03:50.179 --> 03:51.348
assuming you're interested.

03:52.114 --> 03:53.182
Okay, what am I missing?

03:54.116 --> 03:54.951
Excuse me?

03:54.984 --> 03:56.919
This is a big law firm

03:56.953 --> 03:59.622
with plenty of high-powered
civil litigators.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.064
My practice has been almost
exclusively criminal.

04:03.366 --> 04:04.401
Why do you want me?

04:06.903 --> 04:08.438
We don't expect
to win the motion.

04:09.672 --> 04:12.309
Our goal is to attract
attention.

04:12.342 --> 04:14.611
Now, in addition to being a...

04:14.644 --> 04:16.144
pretty gifted attorney,

04:16.178 --> 04:17.279
you're attractive,

04:17.314 --> 04:19.216
and at the moment,
extremely hot copy,

04:19.249 --> 04:21.451
given your murder conviction
and recent release.

04:21.483 --> 04:22.252
Basically,

04:22.285 --> 04:25.322
we think you'll make the news.

04:25.355 --> 04:27.290
I want this particular policy

04:27.324 --> 04:28.124
to get some play.

04:28.157 --> 04:29.459
What's the policy?

04:30.059 --> 04:31.294
We don't fly Arabs.

04:33.095 --> 04:34.497
You're kidding, right?

04:34.530 --> 04:35.765
I'm not kidding.

04:35.798 --> 04:37.166
We wanna be known as the most

04:37.200 --> 04:39.502
security-conscious airline
in the new world.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.572
RALPH: Obviously, the longer
this thing stays in play,

04:42.605 --> 04:43.940
the more publicity it generates.

04:44.741 --> 04:46.676
Ideally, we'd like to get Roland
on the stand

04:46.709 --> 04:47.610
for an evidentiary hearing.

04:47.644 --> 04:49.145
If you can accomplish that,

04:49.178 --> 04:50.112
fantastic.

04:52.181 --> 04:53.783
You don't fly Arabs?

04:56.653 --> 04:59.055
She's a total loon, Eugene.

04:59.088 --> 05:00.297
Let's just do our job.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.331
What is our job?

05:01.364 --> 05:02.532
The directive from the client

05:02.565 --> 05:04.701
has been to authenticate
her breasts.

05:04.734 --> 05:05.835
Well, did they at least
take away

05:05.868 --> 05:06.936
her driver's license?

05:06.969 --> 05:08.004
Excuse me?

05:08.037 --> 05:09.672
When she ran over
her last lover?

05:09.706 --> 05:12.342
She wasn't convicted
of that, Lucy.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.610
(door opens)

05:14.577 --> 05:15.612
FRUTT: Sophie?

05:15.645 --> 05:16.746
I thought we were
gonna meet down

05:16.779 --> 05:17.547
at the courthouse?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.616
I know, but...

05:19.649 --> 05:21.651
can I talk to the two of you
for a second?

05:23.853 --> 05:25.688
I'm starting to panic a little.

05:25.722 --> 05:27.657
I don't think I should testify.

05:28.358 --> 05:29.959
Shouldn't testify?

05:29.992 --> 05:32.161
You're the alibi.
I know,

05:32.194 --> 05:34.030
but...

05:34.063 --> 05:37.200
I have a little skeleton
in my closet,

05:37.234 --> 05:39.035
and I am suddenly afraid

05:39.068 --> 05:40.570
that if the D. A. finds out--

05:40.603 --> 05:41.738
What skeleton?

05:41.771 --> 05:43.973
Four years ago, I...

05:44.006 --> 05:45.942
sort of changed my name,

05:45.975 --> 05:47.877
and not exactly legally.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.413
What do you mean you sort of
changed your name?

05:50.447 --> 05:52.582
I embezzled...

05:52.615 --> 05:53.383
a little

05:53.416 --> 05:55.117
from a former employer.

05:55.151 --> 05:56.986
It was nothing too serious.

05:57.019 --> 05:59.256
But my lawyer said
that there was a possibility

05:59.289 --> 06:00.330
that I could go to jail,

06:00.363 --> 06:02.499
so I fled the state

06:02.532 --> 06:03.733
and came to Massachusetts.

06:03.766 --> 06:06.503
And with the help of some
less reputable lawyers,

06:06.536 --> 06:09.239
I became Sophie Taylor.

06:11.308 --> 06:13.776
DONNELL: She tells you this
an hour before trial?

06:13.810 --> 06:15.512
BERLUTI: I'm not sure
you can call her.

06:15.545 --> 06:17.214
Why?
Because you can't knowingly

06:17.247 --> 06:18.915
put up a witness to lie.

06:18.948 --> 06:21.218
She so much as says
the name "Sophie Taylor,"

06:21.251 --> 06:23.052
it's a lie.
Look, the likelihood

06:23.085 --> 06:25.255
is the prosecution will have
no idea about this.

06:25.288 --> 06:27.724
She has no record
as Sophie Taylor.

06:27.757 --> 06:29.526
That isn't relevant
to the legal ethics.

06:29.559 --> 06:30.860
BERLUTI: What's her real name?

06:30.893 --> 06:32.128
She won't tell us.

06:32.161 --> 06:34.264
Jamie, maybe you and Lucy
could find that out.

06:34.297 --> 06:35.732
DONNELL: Why don't you just
plead this thing?

06:35.765 --> 06:37.334
We'd love to. Helen won't.

06:37.367 --> 06:38.968
The best they'll offer
is murder two.

06:39.001 --> 06:41.238
Then go with what you've got.

06:43.573 --> 06:45.808
This man is an American citizen.

06:45.842 --> 06:47.176
He's a college professor.

06:47.210 --> 06:48.678
The intent is safety here,

06:48.711 --> 06:51.814
not bias, and when--
KENDALL: Oh, come on, counsel.

06:51.848 --> 06:54.050
The assumption itself is a bias.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.518
To make an airline safe,

06:55.552 --> 06:57.487
you have to exclude Arabs?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.555
Your Honor, I will admit

06:58.588 --> 07:00.263
the outrageousness
of this policy.

07:00.297 --> 07:02.532
How generous of you.
Do you also acknowledge

07:02.565 --> 07:04.501
something called
equal protection?

07:04.534 --> 07:06.436
DOLE: The rich are already
doing this.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.137
They're chartering
private Gulf Streams

07:08.170 --> 07:09.606
to fly on Arab-free planes.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.774
One could argue my client
is serving equality

07:11.808 --> 07:13.175
by offering the same privilege

07:13.210 --> 07:14.010
to the middle class.

07:14.043 --> 07:16.145
One could argue it, I wouldn't.

07:16.178 --> 07:17.547
With the court's permission,

07:17.580 --> 07:19.582
I'd like to conduct
a short evidentiary hearing

07:19.616 --> 07:21.418
so you can hear directly
from my client.

07:21.451 --> 07:23.019
We don't need a hearing
to determine whether or not--

07:23.052 --> 07:24.454
DOLE: I will submit the laws

07:24.487 --> 07:27.424
in this area are complicated.

07:27.457 --> 07:28.758
If you're going to shut us down,

07:28.791 --> 07:30.627
I would at least request
the courtesy

07:30.660 --> 07:32.262
of hearing what my client
has to say.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.235
2:00.

07:40.570 --> 07:41.938
GAMBLE: Revenge is said to be

07:41.971 --> 07:43.973
the greatest of all motivators.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.677
There is no psychological
force greater,

07:47.710 --> 07:52.181
none than the will to get even.

07:52.215 --> 07:53.983
You will hear evidence

07:54.016 --> 07:55.151
how Cassie Ray

07:55.184 --> 07:57.287
and Jason Scott were lovers.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.322
They even had a child together.

07:59.356 --> 08:01.898
Then, early last May,

08:01.931 --> 08:03.766
Jason Scott broke it off

08:05.101 --> 08:08.305
and Cassie Ray became enraged.

08:08.338 --> 08:11.341
The evidence will reveal
the threats

08:11.374 --> 08:13.142
the defendant made
against the victim.

08:13.175 --> 08:16.446
The evidence will show
on May 23rd,

08:16.479 --> 08:19.081
in the middle of the night,

08:19.115 --> 08:20.650
Cassie Ray

08:20.683 --> 08:22.885
drove to the victim's house,

08:22.919 --> 08:25.855
picked up a baseball bat,

08:25.888 --> 08:27.089
and attacked the victim

08:27.123 --> 08:28.325
while he lay sleeping.

08:28.358 --> 08:30.627
The coroner will tell you

08:30.660 --> 08:33.062
Jason Scott was struck
on the head

08:33.095 --> 08:35.998
over 50 times.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.868
The expert psychiatrist

08:38.900 --> 08:40.203
will tell you

08:40.236 --> 08:42.438
that this inhuman brutality

08:42.472 --> 08:43.806
can only come

08:43.840 --> 08:46.409
from profound vengeance.

08:47.176 --> 08:48.311
Most of all,

08:48.345 --> 08:49.912
the evidence will reveal

08:49.946 --> 08:50.913
that this brutal murder

08:50.947 --> 08:53.049
was committed by Cassie Ray.

08:55.652 --> 08:57.554
The evidence will indeed reveal

08:57.587 --> 08:59.222
this was a brutal,
vicious murder,

08:59.256 --> 09:01.431
but that's all the evidence
will tell you.

09:01.464 --> 09:03.666
The evidence here is thin,

09:03.700 --> 09:05.067
circumstantial,

09:05.101 --> 09:07.304
no witnesses.

09:07.337 --> 09:09.406
Cassie Ray has an alibi.

09:09.439 --> 09:11.140
She was at home sleeping

09:11.173 --> 09:12.875
on the evening of May 23rd,

09:12.909 --> 09:14.777
and her nanny
will take the stand

09:14.811 --> 09:16.413
and tell you my client

09:16.446 --> 09:19.249
never left her house.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.352
Prosecution has a burden

09:22.385 --> 09:23.820
to prove guilt

09:23.853 --> 09:25.888
beyond all reasonable doubt.

09:25.922 --> 09:27.490
The evidence will reveal

09:27.524 --> 09:29.726
they can't even come close.

09:31.661 --> 09:33.796
What the jury
won't be allowed to hear

09:33.830 --> 09:35.131
is that Cassie Ray

09:35.164 --> 09:36.999
was arrested seven years ago

09:37.033 --> 09:38.735
for mowing down another lover

09:38.768 --> 09:40.437
with her SUV.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.971
Since Ms. Ray was acquitted

09:42.004 --> 09:43.172
of that murder,

09:43.206 --> 09:46.042
the information
is inadmissible.

09:46.075 --> 09:48.245
In other legal news,
Seaboard Airlines

09:48.278 --> 09:50.012
was sued today in federal court

09:50.046 --> 09:52.815
for its refusal
to allow passengers

09:52.849 --> 09:55.218
of Arab or Islamic descent

09:55.252 --> 09:56.753
on its aircraft.

09:58.788 --> 09:59.796
Well, they made the news.

09:59.829 --> 10:01.198
That's what they wanted, right?

10:01.231 --> 10:03.833
Lucy, is it okay
if I transfer my calls?

10:03.866 --> 10:05.502
I need to pick up
the little man at daycare.

10:05.535 --> 10:06.936
Sure.
WASHINGTON: Maybe you should get

10:06.969 --> 10:09.406
your own secretary.

10:09.439 --> 10:10.373
I'm sorry?

10:10.407 --> 10:11.574
You have your own practice now.

10:11.608 --> 10:12.909
Maybe you should have
your own secretary.

10:15.478 --> 10:16.479
Is there a problem?

10:16.513 --> 10:17.880
Well, you know,
I'm just concerned

10:17.914 --> 10:19.181
that people will call,
get Lucy,

10:19.216 --> 10:20.317
and think you still work here.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.084
And we'll be confused
with the kind of firm

10:22.118 --> 10:23.453
that defends bigots.

10:24.921 --> 10:26.789
Oh. I see.

10:28.325 --> 10:29.559
You defend murderers,

10:29.592 --> 10:31.428
but a bigot?
It is not the same thing,

10:31.461 --> 10:32.895
and you know it.
All right.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.964
WASHINGTON: We don't defend
a person's right to kill.

10:34.997 --> 10:37.234
You are defending
this client's right

10:37.267 --> 10:39.436
to engage in racial profiling.

10:39.469 --> 10:40.803
And to the extent
that you're helping

10:40.837 --> 10:42.239
to legitimize prejudice,

10:42.272 --> 10:43.840
don't think you're not fueling
a murder or two

10:43.873 --> 10:46.142
down the road, Lindsay.
I need to take cases, Rebecca.

10:46.175 --> 10:47.344
You didn't need to take
that one.

10:47.377 --> 10:48.711
DOLE: I'm trying to build
a civil practice here.

10:48.745 --> 10:51.180
WASHINGTON: You didn't need
to take that one.

10:58.255 --> 11:01.198
McGUIRE: That's pretty much
how he looked when we arrived.

11:01.231 --> 11:02.365
GAMBLE: Detective,

11:02.399 --> 11:04.201
who called the police
to the scene?

11:04.234 --> 11:05.402
Ms. Ray's nanny,

11:05.435 --> 11:07.003
she was dropping the child
off for a visit

11:07.036 --> 11:08.137
when she discovered the body.

11:08.170 --> 11:10.006
And, detective,
could you tell us

11:10.039 --> 11:11.774
what physical evidence
you found?

11:11.808 --> 11:14.010
The defendant's fingerprints
were all over the house.

11:14.043 --> 11:16.446
We found hair genetically
matching the defendant's,

11:16.479 --> 11:18.481
specifically one
of the defendant's hairs

11:18.515 --> 11:20.016
was found on the murder weapon.

11:20.049 --> 11:21.784
Her bloody shoe print,

11:21.818 --> 11:24.287
tire tracks matching
the defendant's car.

11:24.321 --> 11:26.523
We also found a bite mark
on the victim.

11:26.556 --> 11:28.558
Dental imprints revealed
an exact match

11:28.591 --> 11:29.692
with the defendant.

11:29.726 --> 11:31.027
Fresh bite mark?

11:31.060 --> 11:33.029
Within the last 24 hours, yes.

11:33.062 --> 11:34.597
Possible he was bitten

11:34.631 --> 11:35.998
the day before he was killed?

11:36.533 --> 11:38.468
We can't rule it out, but--
YOUNG: Thank you.

11:38.501 --> 11:40.337
And if my client
were in that house

11:40.370 --> 11:41.838
the day before this murder,

11:41.871 --> 11:43.406
it's possible she left
her prints,

11:43.440 --> 11:44.974
tire tracks,
and hair behind then.

11:45.007 --> 11:46.409
Isn't it, detective?

11:46.443 --> 11:47.544
McGUIRE: Anything's possible,

11:47.577 --> 11:49.612
counsel, but again, I--
My client also came

11:49.646 --> 11:51.180
to the house once the body
was discovered,

11:51.214 --> 11:52.081
didn't she?

11:52.114 --> 11:53.350
She entered the premises.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.884
She did. She was restrained.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.119
YOUNG: She contaminated
the scene, didn't she?

11:57.153 --> 11:58.255
Part of the scene.

11:58.288 --> 11:59.256
Possible she left

11:59.289 --> 12:01.063
her bloody footprint then,
isn't it?

12:01.097 --> 12:02.665
McGUIRE: We don't believe
it was left then.

12:02.699 --> 12:04.534
YOUNG: Can you rule it out?

12:04.567 --> 12:05.835
McGUIRE: No, but--
YOUNG: You found

12:05.868 --> 12:08.004
the baseball bat on the floor.

12:08.037 --> 12:09.206
That's correct.

12:09.239 --> 12:11.040
Well then it's possible

12:11.073 --> 12:12.275
the hair you found on the bat

12:12.309 --> 12:14.777
could have come off the carpet,

12:14.811 --> 12:15.745
right?

12:18.948 --> 12:20.550
I heard her screaming at him.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.419
The defendant?
JESSEL: The very day

12:22.452 --> 12:23.253
before the murder.

12:23.286 --> 12:25.154
I was walking my cat

12:25.187 --> 12:26.589
past Jason's house.

12:26.623 --> 12:28.325
Oh, God rest his soul.

12:28.358 --> 12:30.460
And I heard her yelling,

12:30.493 --> 12:31.628
"You can't do this.

12:31.661 --> 12:33.062
I won't let you do this."

12:33.095 --> 12:34.531
And I even thought

12:34.564 --> 12:35.898
I heard a scuffle.

12:35.932 --> 12:38.735
Now, Ms. Jessel,

12:38.768 --> 12:40.169
the night of the murder,

12:40.203 --> 12:42.239
did you observe
anything unusual?

12:42.272 --> 12:43.540
Yes.

12:43.573 --> 12:44.741
About 1:00 A. M.,

12:44.774 --> 12:46.209
I was walking my cat,

12:46.243 --> 12:48.611
we're both fairly nocturnal,

12:48.645 --> 12:50.447
and I saw her car parked

12:50.480 --> 12:52.449
one street over from his house.

12:52.482 --> 12:53.783
The defendant's car?

12:53.816 --> 12:56.118
Parked a street away

12:56.152 --> 12:58.688
like she didn't want anyone
to notice.

12:58.721 --> 13:00.497
But I noticed.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.832
You were walking your cat?

13:02.865 --> 13:05.402
Yes, I was.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.169
I suppose that makes me crazy?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.771
You said you saw

13:08.805 --> 13:10.840
my client's car.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.008
What was the license plate?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.411
It's a Mercedes, silver.

13:14.444 --> 13:15.612
You didn't get the license?

13:15.645 --> 13:16.479
No.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.681
Do you believe in past lives,

13:18.715 --> 13:19.782
Ms. Jessel?

13:19.816 --> 13:22.419
Nor does that make me crazy,

13:22.452 --> 13:24.454
if that's your implication.

13:24.487 --> 13:25.322
Were you on earth

13:25.355 --> 13:26.423
before this life?

13:26.456 --> 13:27.824
Yes, I was.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.726
FRUTT: As?

13:29.759 --> 13:31.494
A cat.

13:31.528 --> 13:33.763
(indistinct chatter)

13:33.796 --> 13:35.698
ROLAND: It's discrimination.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.166
I don't pretend otherwise.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.635
But it's necessary.

13:38.668 --> 13:40.102
DOLE: Why?

13:40.136 --> 13:42.505
Look, we can screen baggage,

13:42.539 --> 13:43.973
search passengers,

13:44.006 --> 13:45.308
get most of the weapons,

13:45.342 --> 13:47.109
but you know who we catch?

13:47.143 --> 13:48.345
The unwitting people

13:48.378 --> 13:51.147
who aren't really trying
to get past us.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.015
And even some of them get by.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.817
Anybody truly determined

13:54.851 --> 13:57.487
to take a plane down.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.730
(sighs) I just can't look
my customers in the eye

14:00.763 --> 14:02.732
and say, "I guarantee
it won't happen."

14:02.765 --> 14:04.901
But you can if you ban Arabs?

14:04.934 --> 14:06.369
We improve our chances.

14:06.403 --> 14:09.105
The terrorists we're most
at risk from

14:09.138 --> 14:10.873
come from the Muslim world.

14:10.907 --> 14:12.809
That's a fact.

14:12.842 --> 14:14.110
Also a fact,

14:14.143 --> 14:15.512
this is racial profiling.

14:15.545 --> 14:16.813
Without a doubt.

14:16.846 --> 14:18.681
But we're not the first
to do it.

14:18.715 --> 14:20.049
Immigration fingerprints

14:20.082 --> 14:22.018
and photographs any Islamic

14:22.051 --> 14:23.586
coming into this country.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.488
We don't do that
with the French.

14:25.522 --> 14:28.625
But what you're doing
isn't tightening security.

14:28.658 --> 14:30.092
You're barring them.

14:30.126 --> 14:30.760
ROLAND: Look,

14:30.793 --> 14:32.962
people do not feel comfortable

14:32.995 --> 14:35.265
seeing an Arab person
on their plane.

14:35.298 --> 14:37.534
They do not feel safe.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.602
I'm in a customer-service
business here.

14:39.636 --> 14:42.004
If my customer
does not feel safe,

14:42.038 --> 14:44.106
I'm out of business.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.375
That's what this is
really about,

14:45.408 --> 14:46.409
isn't it, Mr. Monroe?

14:46.443 --> 14:48.345
The bottom line?
It's about trying

14:48.378 --> 14:49.646
to assure our customers

14:49.679 --> 14:53.250
that the security--
FURST: "We don't fly Arabs."

14:53.283 --> 14:54.551
Mr. Furst,

14:54.584 --> 14:56.519
I'm a great believer
in equal justice.

14:56.553 --> 14:57.887
But so were most of the people

14:57.920 --> 14:59.489
on those planes September 11th.

14:59.522 --> 15:01.598
That's as cheap
as it is offensive.

15:01.631 --> 15:02.899
I don't think so.

15:02.932 --> 15:04.201
We have all kinds of weapons

15:04.234 --> 15:05.468
that can avoid detection.

15:05.502 --> 15:07.069
Plus, these terrorists
are trained

15:07.103 --> 15:08.738
in physical combat.

15:08.771 --> 15:09.906
Even if you eliminate

15:09.939 --> 15:11.040
the weapons--
FURST: What if your research

15:11.073 --> 15:13.042
showed that blacks
were more likely to commit

15:13.075 --> 15:14.244
mayhem on a plane?

15:14.277 --> 15:16.078
I would never exclude blacks

15:16.112 --> 15:18.381
because I would consider
that bias to be unreasonable.

15:18.415 --> 15:20.383
This prejudice isn't.

15:20.417 --> 15:23.353
There are 1.6 billion Muslims

15:23.386 --> 15:24.421
in the world,

15:24.454 --> 15:25.522
and you're discriminating

15:25.555 --> 15:26.823
against all of them

15:26.856 --> 15:28.958
because of the actions of 19.

15:28.991 --> 15:30.092
That's reasonable?

15:30.126 --> 15:31.428
Start your own company

15:31.461 --> 15:33.263
and run it the way you'd like.

15:33.296 --> 15:34.797
I should get the same courtesy.

15:34.831 --> 15:35.798
FURST: We don't give people
the right

15:35.832 --> 15:37.334
to be a bigot in this country.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.935
How about the right to be safe?

15:38.968 --> 15:41.971
What if somebody was convicted
of a crime?

15:42.004 --> 15:43.473
Do you screen them out?

15:43.506 --> 15:44.441
No.

15:44.474 --> 15:46.243
What about, say, your attorney?

15:46.276 --> 15:48.044
Would you fly her?
Objection!

15:50.046 --> 15:51.381
SOPHIE: I've been
her son's nanny

15:51.414 --> 15:53.015
for almost two years.

15:53.049 --> 15:54.150
FRUTT: You're a live-in?

15:54.183 --> 15:55.452
Yes, and my bedroom

15:55.485 --> 15:57.454
is right over the garage.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.256
Ma'am, I call your attention

15:59.289 --> 16:02.131
to the night of May 23rd, 2002.

16:02.164 --> 16:03.300
Where were you that night?

16:03.333 --> 16:05.802
I was home at Cassie's house.

16:05.835 --> 16:06.603
FRUTT: And was she there?

16:06.636 --> 16:09.038
Yes, she was all night.

16:09.071 --> 16:09.939
FRUTT: Can you tell us

16:09.972 --> 16:12.041
what you remember specifically?

16:12.074 --> 16:13.643
SOPHIE: Yes.

16:13.676 --> 16:15.945
Cassie was having
sinus problems,

16:15.978 --> 16:17.580
so she took some sleeping pills

16:17.614 --> 16:18.715
to help her sleep,

16:18.748 --> 16:20.883
and since they kind of
knock her out,

16:20.917 --> 16:23.320
she asked me to listen
for Timothy

16:23.353 --> 16:24.821
in case he should cry.

16:24.854 --> 16:26.956
I left the door open
so I could hear.

16:26.989 --> 16:28.725
Are you a deep sleeper?

16:28.758 --> 16:31.193
I'm an extremely light sleeper.

16:31.728 --> 16:33.396
Do you know whether my client

16:33.430 --> 16:34.997
ever left the house that night?

16:35.031 --> 16:36.098
She couldn't have.

16:36.132 --> 16:38.000
If she so much as started
the car,

16:38.034 --> 16:39.569
she would've woken me.

16:40.102 --> 16:41.037
Thank you.

16:44.907 --> 16:46.175
Ms. Taylor,

16:49.212 --> 16:51.147
you're very devoted
to Cassie Ray, aren't you?

16:51.714 --> 16:52.882
SOPHIE: Yes.

16:52.915 --> 16:54.917
But I am telling the truth.

16:54.951 --> 16:56.653
She never left the house
that night.

16:57.354 --> 16:58.755
I see. Did you?

16:59.829 --> 17:01.431
Did I?

17:01.464 --> 17:02.098
No.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.533
GAMBLE: After you discovered

17:03.566 --> 17:05.166
Jason Scott's body,

17:05.202 --> 17:06.736
and the police arrived,

17:06.769 --> 17:08.570
do you remember
what you told them?

17:08.605 --> 17:09.906
Not really.

17:09.939 --> 17:11.374
I was in shock.

17:11.407 --> 17:13.443
They had to calm me down.

17:13.476 --> 17:15.077
You don't remember telling
the police

17:15.111 --> 17:16.512
that you left the house
that night.

17:17.946 --> 17:19.249
I didn't tell them that.

17:19.281 --> 17:20.383
GAMBLE: Well, yes, you did.

17:20.416 --> 17:21.917
You said you were home all night

17:21.951 --> 17:23.619
with the exception
of when you called a cab

17:23.653 --> 17:24.854
to go to the pharmacy.

17:25.954 --> 17:27.957
You see that man, Sophie?

17:29.226 --> 17:31.461
He's the cab driver
who drove you.

17:31.494 --> 17:33.230
Now do you remember going
to the pharmacy?

17:34.364 --> 17:36.966
SOPHIE: I forgot that I told
the police about that.

17:36.999 --> 17:40.603
GAMBLE: Oh, you forgot you told
the police that.

17:40.637 --> 17:43.406
Would you be up here lying
to save Cassie?

17:43.440 --> 17:44.641
No.

17:44.674 --> 17:47.244
I forgot about the pharmacy.

17:48.311 --> 17:50.980
I was gone 30 minutes tops.

17:51.013 --> 17:52.048
GAMBLE: Uh-huh.

17:52.081 --> 17:54.083
By the way,

17:54.116 --> 17:55.585
I have no record

17:55.618 --> 17:58.221
of a Sophie Taylor existing

17:58.255 --> 17:59.996
until three years ago.

18:00.029 --> 18:01.564
Would that be your real name?

18:09.872 --> 18:10.907
Am I dead?

18:13.543 --> 18:14.644
It doesn't look good.

18:17.780 --> 18:18.715
Listen,

18:22.652 --> 18:24.454
I think we should plead
to murder two.

18:25.755 --> 18:27.023
I know it's not much,

18:27.056 --> 18:29.459
but it beats murder one.

18:29.492 --> 18:30.960
I know you think I did it.

18:33.630 --> 18:35.198
You don't wanna win this,
do you?

18:35.232 --> 18:36.499
We are doing

18:36.533 --> 18:40.370
our very best, Cassie.

18:40.403 --> 18:43.273
But I have to say,

18:43.306 --> 18:45.508
you were dumped
by two boyfriends,

18:45.542 --> 18:46.909
both end up dead.

18:46.943 --> 18:48.578
It's--
Ryan never dumped me!

18:50.813 --> 18:52.615
Ryan would be New Jersey?

18:52.649 --> 18:54.251
He loved me!

18:54.284 --> 18:55.818
He had a wife and a family.

18:55.852 --> 18:56.853
That's the only reason

18:56.886 --> 18:58.087
he didn't wanna leave.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.356
He loved me!

18:59.389 --> 19:01.398
And I didn't kill him.

19:02.098 --> 19:03.533
I had an alibi.

19:04.634 --> 19:06.903
That's why I didn't get
convicted.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.871
I had an alibi.

19:08.905 --> 19:10.673
FRUTT: Yes, you always seem

19:10.707 --> 19:12.809
to find yourself an alibi.

19:12.842 --> 19:14.544
But your car

19:14.577 --> 19:16.145
ran over him.

19:16.178 --> 19:17.647
It was stolen.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.082
I reported it stolen.

19:20.116 --> 19:23.386
Okay, so someone stole your car

19:23.420 --> 19:24.654
and just happened

19:24.687 --> 19:26.256
to run over your lover with it.

19:26.289 --> 19:28.458
I had an alibi.

19:28.491 --> 19:30.192
And he loved me.

19:30.227 --> 19:33.062
He had a family, that's all.

19:33.095 --> 19:34.331
Don't you go saying

19:34.364 --> 19:36.233
Ryan didn't love me.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.835
And Jason?

19:38.868 --> 19:40.437
He loved you, too?

19:40.470 --> 19:42.405
No.

19:42.439 --> 19:44.173
Jason did dump me.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.011
He deserved what he got.

19:51.781 --> 19:53.182
But I didn't do it.

19:56.286 --> 19:57.820
Ryan loved me.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.665
It was only 'cause he had
a family.

20:10.139 --> 20:11.574
(elevator dings)

20:19.749 --> 20:21.418
Hello.
Hello.

20:30.693 --> 20:32.462
CASSIE: Yes, I bit him.

20:32.495 --> 20:34.063
I was mad at him.

20:34.096 --> 20:35.532
I don't deny that.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.099
But I still loved him.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.736
Why were you so angry
with Jason Scott?

20:39.769 --> 20:41.271
I was in love with him.

20:41.304 --> 20:42.472
I took care of him.

20:42.505 --> 20:43.873
I raised his son.

20:43.906 --> 20:45.074
I made love to him.

20:45.107 --> 20:46.909
I let him nuzzle himself
to sleep

20:46.943 --> 20:48.978
every single night
on my breasts,

20:49.011 --> 20:50.947
which are real, by the way.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.049
I was practically a wife

20:53.082 --> 20:54.417
and he dumped me.

20:54.451 --> 20:55.785
Did you make threats?

20:55.818 --> 20:56.786
Yes.

20:56.819 --> 20:58.788
I screamed at him, I admit.

20:58.821 --> 21:00.196
I even told people I hated him.

21:00.230 --> 21:03.433
But underneath,
I still loved him.

21:03.466 --> 21:04.967
I could never--
YOUNG: Cassie,

21:05.001 --> 21:06.736
did you ever leave your house

21:06.769 --> 21:08.104
the night of his death?

21:08.137 --> 21:11.007
Never. I took a sleeping pill.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.942
I was knocked out.

21:12.975 --> 21:14.277
I was there the day of,

21:14.311 --> 21:15.545
and we argued,

21:15.578 --> 21:16.713
and I bit him,

21:16.746 --> 21:19.249
but I never went there
that night.

21:19.282 --> 21:21.884
GAMBLE: You bit him
because you were angry?

21:21.918 --> 21:24.221
CASSIE: Yes,
and why shouldn't I be?

21:24.254 --> 21:25.222
I have a son,

21:25.255 --> 21:27.023
and right now
he's in foster care,

21:27.056 --> 21:28.157
for God's sakes.

21:28.190 --> 21:29.226
I shouldn't be angry?

21:29.259 --> 21:30.627
Well, he's in foster care

21:30.660 --> 21:31.894
because his father's dead,

21:31.928 --> 21:33.830
and his mother's being charged
with the murder.

21:33.863 --> 21:37.133
Exactly, for which I'm innocent.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.768
How could I not be angry?

21:38.801 --> 21:41.238
Cassie, you get angry a lot,
don't you?

21:41.271 --> 21:42.439
CASSIE: I don't get violent,

21:42.472 --> 21:43.773
if that's where you're headed.

21:43.806 --> 21:46.209
Okay.

21:46.243 --> 21:48.278
Cassie, I'm holding
in my hands your diary.

21:48.311 --> 21:49.512
This is your diary, correct?

21:49.546 --> 21:50.647
CASSIE: Yes.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.181
GAMBLE: I would like you to read

21:52.215 --> 21:55.785
the clipped page
dated March 11, 2002.

21:57.787 --> 21:59.289
"He has his precious bat

21:59.322 --> 22:00.730
he got at an auction

22:00.763 --> 22:02.765
signed by Harmon Killebrew.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.634
I feel like pounding
his head with it.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.869
Maybe one day I will."

22:06.903 --> 22:07.637
(laughs)

22:11.208 --> 22:11.941
Sorry.

22:15.778 --> 22:17.547
You laughed?
I couldn't help it.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.015
What do you mean
you couldn't help it?

22:19.048 --> 22:20.550
How do you laugh?
YOUNG: She bites him,

22:20.583 --> 22:23.052
her prints and hairs
are all over the scene.

22:23.085 --> 22:24.287
She threatens him.

22:24.321 --> 22:27.089
Her alibi turns out to be
a big liar with no name.

22:27.123 --> 22:29.592
I'm thinking, "What else
could possibly go wrong?"

22:29.626 --> 22:31.328
(snaps finger)
Of course.

22:31.361 --> 22:32.995
She puts an entry
in her diary

22:33.029 --> 22:34.431
saying she wants to beat

22:34.464 --> 22:37.166
on his head
with a bat.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.201
Come on.

22:38.235 --> 22:39.836
That doesn't mean you laugh.

22:39.869 --> 22:41.304
Did you know
about this diary?

22:41.338 --> 22:42.205
Of course we didn't know.

22:42.239 --> 22:43.573
That would've taken
the fun out of it.

22:43.606 --> 22:44.741
Eugene.
I can't wait to see

22:44.774 --> 22:45.975
what happens next.

22:46.643 --> 22:47.677
By the way,

22:47.710 --> 22:50.547
Cassie knew the police
had her diary,

22:50.580 --> 22:52.249
and she forgot to tell us.

22:53.650 --> 22:56.018
She forgot to tell us.

22:56.052 --> 22:57.287
DONNELL: What are you gonna do?

22:57.320 --> 22:58.855
YOUNG: What else can I do?

22:58.888 --> 23:00.029
It's plan "B" time.

23:00.062 --> 23:01.431
Plan "B"?

23:01.464 --> 23:02.865
Who?
The nanny.

23:02.899 --> 23:04.434
What?
The nanny?

23:04.467 --> 23:06.035
Unless somebody's got
a better idea.

23:06.068 --> 23:07.637
Eugene.
Bobby,

23:07.670 --> 23:09.206
don't tell me
how ridiculous it is.

23:09.239 --> 23:11.908
This case went to ridiculous
a long time ago.

23:11.941 --> 23:13.276
You're going to accuse
the nanny?

23:13.310 --> 23:15.512
What would be the motive?
Don't need a motive.

23:15.545 --> 23:17.380
Hell, I don't even know
her real name.

23:17.414 --> 23:18.881
It's all a big mystery.

23:18.915 --> 23:20.383
Mystery is doubt,

23:20.417 --> 23:22.519
reasonable doubt.

23:22.552 --> 23:23.653
Maybe they were lovers.

23:23.686 --> 23:25.054
Anybody think about that?

23:25.087 --> 23:26.723
Sophie and Cassie are lovers.

23:26.756 --> 23:28.358
This Jason was getting
in the way,

23:28.391 --> 23:29.926
so out comes
Harmon Killebrew.

23:29.959 --> 23:31.261
Let's go with that.

23:31.294 --> 23:32.362
Eugene, let's think
about this.

23:32.395 --> 23:35.298
EUGENE: Bobby,
what's to think about?

23:35.332 --> 23:37.967
Sophie is as dumb as Cassie.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.968
Who knows?

23:39.001 --> 23:40.270
This might even work.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.707
FURST: These are very
good times

23:44.741 --> 23:46.309
for intolerance.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.744
I mean, come on,
who among us,

23:47.777 --> 23:49.746
if we see a Muslim
on our flight,

23:49.779 --> 23:51.681
doesn't check the bastard
out head to toe?

23:52.849 --> 23:54.784
They blew up
the World Trade Center,

23:54.817 --> 23:55.652
for God's sakes.

23:56.486 --> 23:58.087
And every single one of us,

23:58.120 --> 23:58.955
over a year later,

23:58.988 --> 24:00.897
still feels violated.

24:01.564 --> 24:05.167
But what's being violated
today so openly,

24:05.202 --> 24:08.438
even proudly,
is our civil rights,

24:08.471 --> 24:10.407
our freedom,

24:10.440 --> 24:11.808
the thing that America

24:11.841 --> 24:12.942
is supposed to be about.

24:15.712 --> 24:17.847
There's nothing proud
about this day, Your Honor.

24:21.684 --> 24:23.386
I'm sorry,
I didn't see that coming.

24:24.521 --> 24:25.688
I apologize.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.660
I have this ritual

24:30.693 --> 24:33.630
with my nine-year-old daughter
over breakfast.

24:33.663 --> 24:35.365
I tell her about the case
that I'm arguing,

24:35.398 --> 24:37.066
and she tells me
about school.

24:37.099 --> 24:38.401
And this week,
she's learning

24:38.435 --> 24:39.869
about Rosa Parks.

24:41.103 --> 24:42.805
She said,
"Imagine, daddy.

24:44.140 --> 24:45.542
They used to make blacks sit

24:45.575 --> 24:47.544
in the back of the bus."

24:47.577 --> 24:49.512
Sure,

24:49.546 --> 24:52.349
it's a different world
since 9/11,

24:52.382 --> 24:53.883
but the times
of our nation

24:53.916 --> 24:55.552
have always been defined most

24:55.585 --> 24:58.120
by who we are
as a people.

24:58.154 --> 24:59.556
Well, who are we?

25:00.697 --> 25:03.200
Do we really stand
for liberty?

25:03.233 --> 25:05.435
I mean, are we truly
the champions of equal rights?

25:05.468 --> 25:07.237
Are Martin Luther King's words

25:07.270 --> 25:08.538
about judging a person

25:08.571 --> 25:10.240
by the content
of their character,

25:10.273 --> 25:12.542
not by the color
of their skin?

25:12.575 --> 25:14.311
Do we live
by these words?

25:16.446 --> 25:17.814
Or are they just credos

25:17.847 --> 25:19.048
that we trumpet

25:19.081 --> 25:20.717
when we're not running scared?

25:33.730 --> 25:35.064
"We the people."

25:36.032 --> 25:38.000
That's how
our constitution begins.

25:39.068 --> 25:40.970
Since 9/11,

25:41.003 --> 25:43.673
the people want justice.

25:43.706 --> 25:46.343
People want revenge.

25:46.376 --> 25:48.010
But mostly,

25:48.044 --> 25:49.912
people want security.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.050
Our government
tells us every day,

25:54.083 --> 25:55.952
"The next attack is coming.

25:55.985 --> 25:56.753
Be on the lookout."

25:56.786 --> 25:58.455
It's not a question of if,

25:58.488 --> 26:00.463
but when.

26:00.497 --> 26:03.333
It's not about
screening weapons.

26:03.366 --> 26:05.602
The airplane itself
is the weapon.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.136
It's a big,
flying bomb.

26:08.037 --> 26:10.039
It has to be about stopping
certain people

26:10.072 --> 26:12.375
from getting on board,

26:12.409 --> 26:14.577
and, yes,
by certain people,

26:14.611 --> 26:15.612
I mean Arabs.

26:16.646 --> 26:18.648
Racial profiling

26:18.681 --> 26:20.617
is a terrible thing,

26:20.650 --> 26:22.985
but the reality is,

26:23.019 --> 26:25.255
it has become necessary.

26:26.389 --> 26:29.559
These terrorists
are unlike

26:29.592 --> 26:32.562
any enemy
that we have ever faced.

26:33.195 --> 26:35.398
They're not just evil.

26:35.432 --> 26:37.567
They're educated,
trained,

26:37.600 --> 26:39.636
and willing
to die themselves.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.638
They live among us
as neighbors.

26:41.671 --> 26:44.474
They are among us.

26:45.908 --> 26:46.876
It's not possible

26:46.909 --> 26:49.912
to behaviorally
pick them out.

26:49.946 --> 26:52.449
That's why,
to be safe,

26:52.482 --> 26:55.285
an airline has
to screen them all.

26:55.318 --> 26:57.820
Or at least an airline
should be allowed to.

26:58.421 --> 26:59.356
When I was growing up,

26:59.389 --> 27:00.697
America was always a land

27:00.730 --> 27:02.199
whose borders were open,

27:02.232 --> 27:05.402
a place where anybody
from any nation

27:05.435 --> 27:06.336
could come to our shores,

27:06.369 --> 27:07.570
work hard,

27:07.604 --> 27:08.971
and fulfill his dreams.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.809
I've always loved
being an American.

27:15.312 --> 27:16.679
I have a young son,

27:17.847 --> 27:19.048
and...

27:20.149 --> 27:22.252
once my dream for him

27:23.986 --> 27:26.456
was to grow up
in this America.

27:28.358 --> 27:30.393
But that's no longer
a possibility

27:31.761 --> 27:33.095
and I cry about that.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.666
I cry for my son.

27:38.301 --> 27:39.669
But as his mother,

27:42.004 --> 27:43.573
I want him to be safe.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.109
I want for him to be able
to get on a plane

27:47.143 --> 27:48.978
that won't be used
as a bomb.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.549
And I don't think
you can dismiss that

27:52.582 --> 27:54.351
as paranoia,
Your Honor,

27:56.619 --> 27:57.520
when our own leaders

27:57.554 --> 27:59.322
are telling us
to be afraid.

28:03.466 --> 28:04.567
I'll remind you, Ms. Taylor,

28:04.601 --> 28:06.703
that you're under oath.

28:06.736 --> 28:08.938
We had a lot of surprises
earlier, didn't we?

28:08.971 --> 28:10.840
Turns out you were gone
from the house.

28:10.873 --> 28:13.042
Sophie Taylor
isn't your real name.

28:13.075 --> 28:15.278
Kind of begs the question,
doesn't it?

28:17.046 --> 28:18.715
You killed Jason Scott,
didn't you?

28:18.748 --> 28:20.116
What?
It was you.

28:20.149 --> 28:21.751
What are you doing?
What's going on?

28:21.784 --> 28:22.619
PATRICK: Mr. Young...

28:22.652 --> 28:24.053
YOUNG: Your Honor,
I have reason

28:24.086 --> 28:25.822
to suspect this woman
of the murder.

28:25.855 --> 28:27.324
This woman is a felon.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.959
What state did you flee

28:29.992 --> 28:31.228
after you were caught
embezzling?

28:31.261 --> 28:33.563
Hey.
What's your name, ma'am?

28:33.596 --> 28:36.165
I told you that in private.
You're not my client, ma'am.

28:36.199 --> 28:37.634
What's your name?
You can't do this.

28:37.667 --> 28:38.868
Tell us who you are.

28:38.901 --> 28:40.937
Your Honor, I plead
the Second Amendment.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.772
Let's try the Fifth.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.941
Did you kill Jason Scott?
No!

28:44.974 --> 28:46.709
You had keys
to his house, her car.

28:46.743 --> 28:48.811
You could've easily taken
one of Cassie's hairs

28:48.845 --> 28:49.979
and stuck it to a bat.

28:50.012 --> 28:50.747
Your Honor.
SOPHIE: What?

28:50.780 --> 28:52.081
You're crazy.
YOUNG: Your Honor,

28:52.114 --> 28:53.783
I demand you order this woman

28:53.816 --> 28:55.084
to reveal her real name!

28:55.117 --> 28:56.586
Maybe she's killed others.

28:56.619 --> 28:58.421
Mr. Young, settle down.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.121
Now.

29:01.598 --> 29:03.099
You know what,
Ms. Taylor,

29:03.132 --> 29:04.667
or whoever you are,

29:04.701 --> 29:05.935
I am going to order you

29:05.968 --> 29:07.404
to tell us your true identity.

29:07.437 --> 29:09.539
Otherwise, I will hold you
in contempt.

29:14.010 --> 29:15.678
Marge Fennell.

29:17.414 --> 29:19.949
I'm from Connecticut.

29:19.982 --> 29:22.819
And who did you embezzle
from, Ms. Fennell?

29:24.787 --> 29:25.755
I didn't.

29:28.658 --> 29:30.260
I just made it up

29:30.293 --> 29:32.295
to make me sound
a little exotic.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.132
I got a speeding ticket once.

29:36.165 --> 29:39.101
(music playing)

29:50.480 --> 29:52.449
Well, we had to at least try.

29:52.482 --> 29:53.483
Now what?

29:53.516 --> 29:55.352
Showtime, I guess.
Showtime?

29:55.385 --> 29:57.053
I thought we already
had Showtime.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.087
What are you gonna do now?

29:58.120 --> 29:58.955
I'm going to close.

29:58.988 --> 29:59.756
FRUTT: With what?

29:59.789 --> 30:01.264
United States of America.

30:08.705 --> 30:09.372
MAN: be seated.

30:17.747 --> 30:21.017
I find it almost
unimaginable

30:21.050 --> 30:23.386
that we are in court
to decide

30:23.420 --> 30:24.787
whether it is permissible

30:24.821 --> 30:26.823
for an airline
to discriminate

30:26.856 --> 30:28.057
against a group

30:28.090 --> 30:31.928
based on its ethnicity.

30:31.961 --> 30:33.195
It is a flat-out violation

30:33.230 --> 30:35.465
of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964,

30:35.498 --> 30:37.567
The Commerce Clause,

30:37.600 --> 30:40.303
and the idea repulses me.

30:40.337 --> 30:41.971
It is unimaginable.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.408
But I'm reminded
of a column I read

30:45.442 --> 30:46.343
in the New York Times

30:46.376 --> 30:48.278
by Thomas Friedman.

30:48.311 --> 30:49.812
He said what happened

30:49.846 --> 30:52.482
on September the 11th was...

30:52.515 --> 30:55.852
beyond unimaginable.

30:55.885 --> 30:58.455
It wasn't so much
our intelligence agencies

30:58.488 --> 31:01.664
as it was our imaginations

31:01.698 --> 31:03.200
that failed.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.036
We simply couldn't conceive

31:07.069 --> 31:08.471
that educated people,

31:08.505 --> 31:10.139
from privileged homes no less,

31:10.172 --> 31:11.574
would turn a plane

31:11.608 --> 31:12.909
into a missile,

31:12.942 --> 31:14.544
killing themselves

31:14.577 --> 31:16.313
and so many innocent people.

31:18.014 --> 31:20.082
Mr. Furst, you are asking me

31:20.116 --> 31:21.951
to weigh the principles of law,

31:21.984 --> 31:24.221
of reason,
perhaps morality,

31:24.254 --> 31:26.623
against a phenomenon
of terrorism

31:26.656 --> 31:27.690
that knows

31:27.724 --> 31:30.026
no such boundaries.

31:30.927 --> 31:32.028
That's why the government

31:32.061 --> 31:33.162
has so much as admitted

31:33.195 --> 31:34.531
they don't know
what steps to take

31:34.564 --> 31:38.000
against the ones
waiting to strike next.

31:38.868 --> 31:42.071
They are beyond
our imagination.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.776
Ms. Dole,
you mentioned

31:46.809 --> 31:49.546
that you loved
being an American.

31:49.579 --> 31:50.580
So do I.

31:52.515 --> 31:55.285
I became a judge
first and foremost

31:55.318 --> 31:57.687
to protect those liberties

31:58.788 --> 32:00.597
so afforded us
by the constitution,

32:00.630 --> 32:01.764
those freedoms

32:01.798 --> 32:04.634
that we all hold so precious,

32:04.667 --> 32:06.203
and, until recently,

32:06.236 --> 32:08.705
so fundamental.

32:10.006 --> 32:12.775
But the reality
is we make exceptions

32:12.809 --> 32:14.444
to our constitutional rights

32:14.477 --> 32:16.112
all the time,

32:16.145 --> 32:17.914
be it freedom
of speech,

32:17.947 --> 32:18.881
religion,

32:18.915 --> 32:21.351
none of them is absolute.

32:21.384 --> 32:23.620
The legal test
for doing something

32:23.653 --> 32:26.623
so patently
unconstitutional is,

32:26.656 --> 32:30.460
basically, you better
have a damn good reason.

32:31.861 --> 32:35.298
There has been one other
long-standing reality

32:35.332 --> 32:36.433
in this country.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.337
If not safe,

32:40.370 --> 32:42.772
one can never be free.

32:46.609 --> 32:49.746
With great personal disgust,

32:51.214 --> 32:53.149
I am denying
the plaintiff's motion

32:53.182 --> 32:55.352
for a TRO.

32:55.385 --> 32:57.320
We can all take
consolation in knowing

32:57.354 --> 32:59.796
that this ruling probably
won't stick on appeal,

32:59.829 --> 33:01.698
but let's not kid ourselves.

33:02.765 --> 33:05.368
The day is soon
coming when it will.

33:07.470 --> 33:10.006
Plaintiff's motion denied.

33:10.039 --> 33:11.841
We're adjourned.

33:11.874 --> 33:14.811
(music playing)

33:18.781 --> 33:21.083
Counselor.

33:21.117 --> 33:21.918
Thank you, Lindsay.

33:21.951 --> 33:23.253
Fantastic.

33:23.286 --> 33:23.953
Thanks.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.526
Something tells me you're gonna
have a pretty decent

33:29.559 --> 33:31.093
civil practice
for yourself.

33:40.937 --> 33:41.804
You okay?

33:41.838 --> 33:44.774
(music playing)

34:01.331 --> 34:03.366
She threatened him.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.269
They were heard fighting
the day before.

34:06.303 --> 34:08.771
Her car was seen parked
a block away

34:08.804 --> 34:10.039
the night of the murder.

34:10.072 --> 34:12.942
Her prints, hairs, fibers,

34:12.975 --> 34:14.844
all over the scene
of the crime.

34:14.877 --> 34:16.879
There was even one hair

34:16.913 --> 34:18.248
on the murder weapon.

34:18.281 --> 34:20.583
She left a bloody shoe print.

34:20.617 --> 34:23.152
She puts an alibi
witness up here

34:23.185 --> 34:24.521
who lied,

34:24.554 --> 34:26.856
who admitted she couldn't
totally account

34:26.889 --> 34:28.858
for the defendant's
whereabouts.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.659
She even lied
about her own name.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.663
Who knows what else
she made up?

34:33.696 --> 34:36.998
The psychiatric expert
told you,

34:37.033 --> 34:38.268
there's only one motive

34:38.301 --> 34:39.735
for this kind of killing.

34:39.768 --> 34:41.404
When a man gets hit
on the head

34:41.438 --> 34:43.572
over 50 times,

34:43.606 --> 34:45.074
it's rage,

34:45.107 --> 34:46.342
revenge.

34:48.143 --> 34:50.179
This woman...

34:50.213 --> 34:51.914
wrote in her own diary

34:53.382 --> 34:55.150
"Maybe I'll beat him
on his head

34:55.184 --> 34:56.686
with a baseball bat."

34:58.288 --> 34:59.796
Gee, I wonder what happened.

35:05.101 --> 35:07.370
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting damn sick

35:07.404 --> 35:08.771
and tired of waking up,

35:08.805 --> 35:10.139
reading in the paper

35:10.172 --> 35:12.041
of yet another innocent man

35:12.074 --> 35:14.644
on death row
being cleared by DNA.

35:14.677 --> 35:17.046
How the hell do we put
so many people on death row

35:17.079 --> 35:18.381
for crimes they didn't commit?

35:18.415 --> 35:20.550
I figure it's gotta
be the juries

35:20.583 --> 35:22.452
not doing their jobs.

35:23.753 --> 35:27.224
I'm sure all these suspects
looked guilty.

35:27.257 --> 35:28.591
If they didn't look guilty,

35:28.625 --> 35:29.659
they wouldn't be on trial.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.395
Everybody who gets
arrested looks guilty.

35:32.429 --> 35:34.030
The police are even sure of it,

35:34.063 --> 35:35.398
but it's up to the jury

35:35.432 --> 35:37.033
to make sure they prove it

35:37.066 --> 35:39.469
beyond all reasonable doubt

35:39.502 --> 35:41.704
because this is the United
States of America,

35:41.738 --> 35:43.740
and in the United States
of America,

35:43.773 --> 35:45.107
we don't lock people up,

35:45.141 --> 35:46.509
especially for murder,

35:46.543 --> 35:49.846
unless the government
satisfies that burden.

35:49.879 --> 35:51.648
Now, once we say, "Okay,

35:51.681 --> 35:52.715
you don't have to prove it

35:52.749 --> 35:54.484
beyond all reasonable doubt,"

35:54.517 --> 35:56.118
then the innocent,
including you

35:56.152 --> 35:57.787
and me,
could get locked up.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.356
That's not acceptable

35:59.389 --> 36:00.697
in the United States
of America,

36:00.730 --> 36:01.664
is it?

36:01.698 --> 36:03.099
Is it?

36:03.132 --> 36:05.735
Now, look what we have here.

36:05.768 --> 36:07.437
My client looks guilty,

36:07.470 --> 36:08.605
like Ms. Gamble said.

36:08.638 --> 36:10.540
They got prints,
they got fibers,

36:10.573 --> 36:11.574
hair on the bat,

36:11.608 --> 36:12.342
a diary.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.076
A witness sees the car.

36:14.110 --> 36:15.312
She looks damn guilty,

36:15.345 --> 36:16.579
but when you stop,

36:16.613 --> 36:18.781
she was there the day before.

36:18.815 --> 36:20.049
Of course her prints

36:20.082 --> 36:21.251
and fibers are all over.

36:21.284 --> 36:23.686
A bloody bat falls on the
carpet,

36:23.720 --> 36:25.121
stuff's gonna stick to it,

36:25.154 --> 36:26.055
including hair,

36:26.088 --> 36:28.658
and as for the car
being seen that night,

36:28.691 --> 36:30.593
yeah, by some nut who thinks

36:30.627 --> 36:32.061
she'll come back as a cat.

36:32.094 --> 36:35.598
These aren't the kind
of building blocks we use

36:35.632 --> 36:37.434
to deny a person her freedom

36:37.467 --> 36:39.536
for the rest
of her natural life,

36:39.569 --> 36:42.672
not in the United States
of America.

36:44.140 --> 36:45.708
Now, as for the diary,

36:49.646 --> 36:51.113
you think
she's the first woman

36:51.147 --> 36:53.483
to ever think
about killing her lover?

36:53.516 --> 36:54.751
Come on.

36:54.784 --> 36:56.118
Women think about it three,

36:56.152 --> 36:57.554
four times a day.

36:57.587 --> 36:58.721
She gets punished

36:58.755 --> 37:00.062
for what she thinks

37:00.095 --> 37:02.265
because she writes it down
in a book?

37:02.298 --> 37:05.201
That's not what we do
in this country.

37:05.235 --> 37:06.636
We demand proof,

37:06.669 --> 37:07.770
and it isn't there.

37:07.803 --> 37:11.307
My client took
a sleeping pill.

37:11.341 --> 37:13.343
That was never contradicted.

37:13.376 --> 37:15.911
She was never seen
leaving her house.

37:15.945 --> 37:19.115
It's possible
that somebody else came

37:19.148 --> 37:20.417
into that house.

37:20.450 --> 37:22.552
Detective McGuire
couldn't rule it out.

37:22.585 --> 37:23.820
Did you hear him
rule it out?

37:23.853 --> 37:26.756
No. That somebody could
have been Sophie Taylor

37:26.789 --> 37:28.090
or Marge Fennell

37:28.124 --> 37:30.026
or whatever the hell
her name is.

37:30.059 --> 37:30.927
She's a liar.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.662
She had keys to the car,

37:32.695 --> 37:34.231
keys to the victim's house,

37:34.264 --> 37:35.498
struck me as a wacko.

37:35.532 --> 37:38.601
Who among us doesn't
have doubts about her?

37:41.938 --> 37:45.242
Now, you can think
my client is guilty.

37:45.275 --> 37:47.076
That's reasonable.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.678
The point is,

37:48.711 --> 37:51.248
you can't know it.

37:51.281 --> 37:52.415
You can't be convinced

37:52.449 --> 37:54.884
beyond all reasonable doubt.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.720
And failing that high
standard of proof,

37:58.788 --> 38:03.065
Ms. Ray must be
presumed innocent.

38:05.535 --> 38:06.903
Because, after all,

38:09.071 --> 38:11.274
this is the United States
of America.

38:15.745 --> 38:16.846
(phone rings)

38:18.180 --> 38:20.417
Donnell,
Dole, whatever.

38:20.450 --> 38:21.684
Hey, Ellenor.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.420
Oops.

38:23.453 --> 38:24.521
Now?

38:24.554 --> 38:25.555
All ready?

38:26.923 --> 38:27.624
Okay.

38:29.592 --> 38:30.693
Jury's back.

38:30.727 --> 38:31.728
They were out 16 minutes.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.030
What the hell?

38:34.063 --> 38:35.598
What's wrong?
Call Eugene.

38:35.632 --> 38:36.699
HATCHER: I can't.
They're in court.

38:36.733 --> 38:37.434
Cellphones are off.

38:42.071 --> 38:43.740
(door slams)

38:43.773 --> 38:46.709
(music playing)

38:57.254 --> 38:58.688
Madame Foreperson,

38:58.721 --> 39:00.196
has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:00.730 --> 39:01.598
We have, Your Honor.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.466
Will the defendant
please rise?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.204
What say you?

39:07.237 --> 39:09.572
In the matter of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

39:09.606 --> 39:11.741
versus Cassie Ray,

39:11.774 --> 39:14.010
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:14.043 --> 39:15.645
we find the defendant,

39:15.678 --> 39:18.281
Cassie Ray, guilty.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.217
PATRICK: Members of the jury
are dismissed

39:20.250 --> 39:21.484
with the thanks
of the court.

39:21.518 --> 39:22.219
We're adjourned.

39:22.252 --> 39:22.919
(gavel bangs)

39:26.389 --> 39:27.757
So I go to prison?

39:27.790 --> 39:29.459
FRUTT: You're gonna
go back into custody,

39:29.492 --> 39:31.561
and they're gonna hold you there
till sentencing.

39:31.594 --> 39:33.996
We're gonna go over any
grounds for appeals,

39:34.030 --> 39:35.798
and we're gonna talk
to you tomorrow.

39:38.601 --> 39:40.069
Just hang in there, Cassie.

39:40.102 --> 39:41.538
We're gonna talk
to you tomorrow.

39:44.474 --> 39:46.175
I never thought
that I'd feel sorry

39:46.209 --> 39:47.444
for somebody
who bashed a man

39:47.477 --> 39:49.479
to death with
a baseball bat.

39:51.981 --> 39:52.815
What happened?

39:54.451 --> 39:55.618
We lost.

39:55.652 --> 39:57.053
STRINGER: I found out
who she is.

39:57.086 --> 39:59.121
Who?
STRINGER: Sophie Taylor.

39:59.155 --> 40:00.630
Fennell is her maiden name.

40:00.663 --> 40:02.164
I found out who she is.

40:06.269 --> 40:07.204
(sighs)

40:08.638 --> 40:09.539
(door closes)

40:09.572 --> 40:10.573
Now what?

40:12.309 --> 40:14.911
Ryan Hunter was run over
seven years ago

40:14.944 --> 40:15.745
in New Jersey.

40:15.778 --> 40:18.381
Cassie was prosecuted
and acquitted.

40:18.415 --> 40:19.582
Mrs. Hunter had a breakdown

40:19.616 --> 40:22.084
and was institutionalized.

40:22.118 --> 40:23.820
She was released
three years ago

40:23.853 --> 40:26.088
and changed her name
to Sophie Taylor.

40:28.758 --> 40:30.192
You became a nanny

40:30.227 --> 40:31.528
for your husband's mistress.

40:34.797 --> 40:36.533
Small world.

40:36.566 --> 40:38.268
Did she kill
your husband or did you,

40:38.301 --> 40:39.101
framing her?

40:39.135 --> 40:42.605
Seven years
is a long time

40:42.639 --> 40:43.940
to remember.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.108
I assume Cassie doesn't know

40:46.142 --> 40:47.076
who you really are.

40:47.109 --> 40:50.079
Can I be there
when you tell her?

40:50.112 --> 40:52.715
I would really love
to see her face.

40:52.749 --> 40:54.917
YOUNG: You killed Jason Scott,

40:54.951 --> 40:56.386
set yourself up
as a defense witness

40:56.419 --> 40:58.721
knowing they'd blow
you apart on the stand.

40:58.755 --> 41:00.963
Oh, now, come on.

41:00.997 --> 41:02.932
That's a bit risky.

41:02.965 --> 41:04.567
Why would I take
such a chance?

41:05.034 --> 41:07.704
Because you're insane.

41:07.737 --> 41:10.139
And just like
Helen Gamble said,

41:10.172 --> 41:12.174
revenge is a great motivator.

41:19.382 --> 41:20.650
(door opens)

41:28.190 --> 41:29.559
We'll never get her out,
you know?

41:30.893 --> 41:31.928
The evidence,

41:33.029 --> 41:34.297
a conviction.

41:39.669 --> 41:41.003
We'll never get her out.

41:41.037 --> 41:43.973
(music playing)

41:52.482 --> 41:53.416
(door closes)

41:59.556 --> 42:00.397
Counsel?

42:03.200 --> 42:04.601
Know what'll happen next?

42:06.636 --> 42:10.373
An Islamic is going to say
something anti-American.

42:10.407 --> 42:11.674
He'll be shot dead,

42:12.809 --> 42:13.643
and we're going to see

42:13.676 --> 42:15.912
a new insanity defense.

42:15.945 --> 42:17.580
It'll be called "9/11 rage."

42:20.617 --> 42:22.952
I promise you,

42:22.985 --> 42:24.454
it's coming.

42:24.487 --> 42:26.656
9/11 rage
as diminished capacity,

42:26.689 --> 42:29.191
and the real perversity,

42:31.728 --> 42:32.729
it's a winner,

42:34.231 --> 42:35.765
a sure winner.

42:37.900 --> 42:38.701
(sighs)

42:38.735 --> 42:41.671
(music playing)

42:59.962 --> 43:02.899
(music playing)

43:26.356 --> 43:27.424
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:27.457 --> 43:30.393
(music playing)
