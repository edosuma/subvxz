00:36.134 --> 00:37.979
Have you seen my earring?

00:37.979 --> 00:41.830
Why can't I just write these people a check
and stay home?

00:41.830 --> 00:45.064
- Nobody's gonna miss me.
- You're not getting out of this one.

00:45.064 --> 00:50.089
Half the people are coming just to have their
picture taken with the great Daniel Thorn.

00:51.628 --> 00:55.986
Besides, you bought me
this dress just for tonight.

00:55.986 --> 00:59.890
- Remember?
- Yeah.

00:59.890 --> 01:02.712
I really do have impeccable taste, don't I?

01:02.712 --> 01:05.333
- Me or the dress?
- Both.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.939
Oh.

01:08.394 --> 01:10.605
This thing is gonna kill you some day.

01:10.605 --> 01:14.215
I have to wear it, darling.
It's my trademark.

01:14.215 --> 01:16.609
And we're late!
Which is my other trademark.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.987
I'll just wear these.

01:25.423 --> 01:28.684
Save me, Roberto.
How about you go to this stupid benefit?

01:28.684 --> 01:30.020
I'll stay here.

01:30.020 --> 01:33.827
I can't help you, Mr. Thorn.
Have a good evening.

01:44.486 --> 01:48.264
Mr. T, your car's right out front.
And I put a couple of diet sodas in there, too.

01:48.264 --> 01:49.360
Thank you, Lewis.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.639
Mr. Thorn, over here. One picture.

01:53.604 --> 01:56.303
- What is it?
- Oh, do you have the tickets?

01:56.303 --> 02:00.532
- No, l... I thought you had 'em.
- Oh, I must've left them upstairs.

02:00.532 --> 02:05.191
I'll go, you stay and meet
your adoring public. - All right.

02:11.248 --> 02:13.691
Sheryl, your scarf is caught.

02:13.691 --> 02:15.499
Sheryl!

02:15.499 --> 02:17.107
Daniel!

02:18.400 --> 02:19.988
Somebody, help me!

02:19.988 --> 02:22.033
Roberto,
get to the elevator.

02:22.033 --> 02:24.606
Check on Mrs. Thorn.
It's that damn scarf again.

02:24.606 --> 02:27.648
Just make sure she's okay!

02:34.681 --> 02:36.921
Mr. Thorn, you better come up.

02:36.931 --> 02:40.715
It's Mrs. Thorn.
I think she's dead.

03:55.408 --> 03:58.453
- Hello?
- Hey, Monk! You awake?

03:58.453 --> 04:01.601
Listen, there was a murder here last week.

04:01.601 --> 04:03.500
You know Daniel Thorn?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.304
- Daniel Thorn?
- Daniel Thorn.

04:05.304 --> 04:08.830
The son of a bitch murdered his wife
and he tried to make it look like an accident.

04:08.830 --> 04:12.373
I can prove it.
Monk, I solved the case.

04:12.373 --> 04:14.176
At least I think I did.

04:14.176 --> 04:16.474
Hey, hey.
Keep 'em coming.

04:16.474 --> 04:18.283
Hot pants!

04:19.024 --> 04:21.050
Have you been drinking?

04:21.050 --> 04:23.706
Who, me?
Uh, yeah, a little bit.

04:23.706 --> 04:25.670
Listen, Monk, I need you, man.

04:25.670 --> 04:28.480
I need you to come to Vegas.
I need a second opinion.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.241
I'm staying at the, uh, Monticello Casino,

04:31.241 --> 04:36.965
uh, room 3473.

04:36.965 --> 04:39.215
Vegas.

04:39.215 --> 04:41.461
Las Vegas?

05:12.470 --> 05:15.258
Yeah! Yeah!

05:16.812 --> 05:18.679
Welcome to Sin City, Mr. Monk.

05:18.679 --> 05:23.350
Is it some kind of holiday? - Nope.
It's like this 24 hours a day, all the time.

05:23.350 --> 05:26.015
People come from all over the world
just to give their money away.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.019
- They look miserable.
- They are miserable.

05:28.019 --> 05:30.471
You might be the happiest person here.

05:31.376 --> 05:33.907
You all right? This is nothing.

05:33.907 --> 05:36.331
Wait till the tour buses show up.
This place is gonna be packed.

05:36.331 --> 05:38.854
- How do you know?
- I lived here for two years.

05:38.854 --> 05:40.890
- I was a blackjack dealer.
- I didn't know that.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.308
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

05:43.308 --> 05:46.280
- Really? Like what?
- Like, it's none of your business.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.021
Have you ever done hard time?

05:48.021 --> 05:49.658
Do you think I've done hard time?

05:49.658 --> 05:53.123
- Maybe.
- This way.

06:05.748 --> 06:08.181
Jesus.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.008
Where's my pants?

06:12.008 --> 06:13.997
Hey, Randy, where's my pants?

06:13.997 --> 06:17.017
You threw 'em out the window.

06:17.017 --> 06:22.365
- Why'd I do that?
- One of the girls bet you $1 you wouldn't.

06:25.004 --> 06:27.787
Looks like she paid off.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.815
Coming. I'm coming!

06:30.815 --> 06:33.775
Quit with the pounding!

06:38.182 --> 06:41.980
Which one of you idiots invited Monk?

06:41.980 --> 06:43.380
- Wasn't me.
- Not me.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.608
Come on!

06:48.835 --> 06:52.524
Hey, Monk. Natalie.

06:52.524 --> 06:55.494
- What are you doing here?
- You called him.

06:55.494 --> 06:58.487
- Last night, you told him to come.
- I called you?

06:58.487 --> 07:00.571
You said there had been a murder.

07:00.571 --> 07:01.822
What the hell are you talking about?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.671
- Can we come in?
- Yeah.

07:06.329 --> 07:08.971
- You guys have fun?
- I don't know.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.549
What's the occasion?

07:10.549 --> 07:13.735
Larry Fennigan's bachelor party.

07:13.735 --> 07:16.796
Sgt. Fennigan?
No, I just talked to him last week.

07:16.796 --> 07:17.969
He's not having a bachelor...

07:17.969 --> 07:22.055
Uh, yeah, he must have changed
his mind at the last minute.

07:22.055 --> 07:26.450
- We tried to call you.
- Hey, look. Stripper left her make-up bag.

07:29.062 --> 07:31.006
Strippers?

07:31.006 --> 07:34.981
Uh, it's okay, Monk, 'cause me and,
uh, the other married guys,

07:34.981 --> 07:37.757
we... we went down the hall until she left.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.252
Okay.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.976
I'll meet you guys later.
I'm gonna go hit the tables.

07:43.976 --> 07:47.749
- How's your luck?
- Great. I'm only down $200.

07:47.749 --> 07:49.436
- What are you playin'?
- Blackjack.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.338
Why don't you go next door?
The Mirage has some $5 tables.

07:52.338 --> 07:56.275
$5? Those are the kiddie tables.
I'm here to make some real money.

07:56.275 --> 08:00.557
- I got a system.
- Oh. I didn't know you had a book.

08:00.557 --> 08:02.032
Then you can't lose.

08:02.032 --> 08:05.988
Come on down, see for yourself.
You can help me count my chips.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.978
Hey, wait a minute.
I called you, Monk. - Right.

08:13.978 --> 08:16.484
Yeah, I called...

08:16.484 --> 08:18.461
I solved something. It was big.

08:18.461 --> 08:20.852
Yeah, you said Daniel Thorn murdered his wife.

08:20.852 --> 08:23.734
You said you had proof.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.062
I did?

08:28.556 --> 08:31.117
Okay. This way.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.053
Over here.

08:35.053 --> 08:37.879
Right. This...
This is where she was killed.

08:37.879 --> 08:39.783
Does any of this look familiar?

08:39.783 --> 08:41.707
I don't know.

08:41.707 --> 08:42.866
Wait.

08:42.866 --> 08:46.468
Captain, you-you're only
supposed to take two of those.

08:46.468 --> 08:48.658
"As necessary."

08:48.658 --> 08:51.121
You don't remember anything?
Nothing?

08:51.121 --> 08:55.279
Um, I know I left the party
upstairs at about 1:30.

08:55.279 --> 08:57.101
Okay, okay. Were you alone?

08:57.101 --> 09:01.842
I don't know. I came down,
I played some craps, lost some money.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.503
I talked to someone.

09:03.503 --> 09:05.761
Good. There you go. Who?

09:05.761 --> 09:09.030
It was a man. Or a woman.

09:09.030 --> 09:11.636
Oh, man or a woman.
That narrows it down.

09:11.636 --> 09:14.506
So, it wasn't a child?

09:14.506 --> 09:16.352
- Could have been.
- All right, got the case file.

09:16.352 --> 09:20.384
Lt. Waliver said don't make any copies
of it and I have nice eyes.

09:20.384 --> 09:24.788
Okay, cause of death:
Uh, ligature strangulation and a broken neck.

09:24.788 --> 09:26.250
Waliver said you're wasting your time.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.684
It was an accident.
She strangled on her own scarf.

09:28.684 --> 09:30.653
Okay, let's check it out.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.741
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry,
these are private elevators.

09:32.741 --> 09:35.093
The public elevators are across the lobby.

09:35.093 --> 09:37.076
Yeah. Um, PD.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.749
We're just gonna look around a little bit, okay?

09:38.749 --> 09:42.525
Sure, sure. What's, uh, going on?
Can I help?

09:42.525 --> 09:45.497
Were you on duty the night Mrs. Thorn was...

09:45.497 --> 09:47.502
Why? Is this, like,
an insurance thing?

09:47.502 --> 09:51.073
No, this is a "we ask you some
questions and you answer" thing.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.852
Okay, okay, but you owe me one.

09:53.852 --> 09:56.346
Here's what happened.
They got off the elevator.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.561
Sheryl, that's Mrs. Thorn, said,
"Do you have the tickets?"

09:59.561 --> 10:03.175
Daniel, Mr. Thorn,
checked his pockets, "No."

10:03.175 --> 10:06.536
She got back on the elevator,
elevator doors closed,

10:06.536 --> 10:08.270
and her scarf got caught.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.382
You could hear her screaming from inside:

10:10.382 --> 10:12.874
"Help me, Daniel. Help me"

10:12.874 --> 10:16.628
That's pretty much it.
They found her upstairs.

10:16.628 --> 10:18.489
And she was definitely alone?

10:18.489 --> 10:19.888
Oh, yeah,
I was standing right there.

10:19.888 --> 10:22.213
I got a question.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.628
Were you working last night at 2:00?

10:24.628 --> 10:25.341
Oh, yes, sir.

10:25.341 --> 10:27.215
- Was I here?
- Were you here?

10:27.215 --> 10:28.984
Do you remember me?
Did we talk?

10:28.984 --> 10:31.684
No, sir. I've never seen you before.

10:31.684 --> 10:34.077
Exactly. We never met.

10:34.077 --> 10:35.535
Right. I was just testing you.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.287
You... You passed. Good job.

10:37.287 --> 10:39.546
Um, we're just gonna be a minute, okay?

10:39.546 --> 10:40.367
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:40.367 --> 10:41.634
Yeah.

10:41.634 --> 10:43.110
So it's an express.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.868
Yeah, it goes straight
to the penthouse, non-stop.

10:45.868 --> 10:47.667
There is an access panel.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.347
Can we get up there?

10:49.347 --> 10:52.032
Monk, we're not supposed to be here.
Let's make it quick.

10:52.032 --> 10:54.251
- Ok. Look. Thumbprint scanner.
- Yeah.

10:54.251 --> 10:56.849
This elevator doesn't move
for anyone but Thorn or his wife.

10:56.849 --> 10:59.673
Right, it's all here.
See, Daniel Thorn, uh,

10:59.673 --> 11:04.258
pressed the elevator scanner
at 5:52 to come down,

11:04.258 --> 11:07.590
and then Sheryl Thorn
pressed the scanner at 5:55,

11:07.590 --> 11:11.840
three minutes later,
to go back up in the elevator.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.700
So it was definitely her.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.480
Yeah, positive ID.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.257
What are you doing?

11:22.696 --> 11:25.842
Look, look. It's odd,
look at her thumbprint.

11:25.842 --> 11:29.867
It's at a weird angle.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.202
Why would she press it like that?

11:32.202 --> 11:34.455
I would have pressed it like that.

11:34.455 --> 11:36.795
- Wouldn't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:36.795 --> 11:39.534
Yeah, that is weird.

11:43.559 --> 11:45.361
What is that?

11:45.361 --> 11:47.183
It's a fingernail.

11:47.183 --> 11:49.357
It's dug right into the leather.

11:49.357 --> 11:52.009
It probably broke off
when she was choking to death.

11:52.009 --> 11:54.363
No, I don't think so.

11:54.363 --> 11:56.737
She's too far away from the door.

11:56.737 --> 11:59.521
What do you think?

11:59.521 --> 12:01.484
I think you were right.

12:01.484 --> 12:04.406
Something happened in here.

12:04.406 --> 12:07.326
It was murder.

12:12.070 --> 12:15.048
You know, some people thought
that we should reschedule

12:15.048 --> 12:16.818
this groundbreaking ceremony
after what happened last week.

12:19.678 --> 12:22.885
But I know that Sheryl
would want us here today.

12:22.885 --> 12:23.983
And as you know, uh,

12:23.983 --> 12:27.514
she and I were never able to
have children of our own.

12:27.514 --> 12:32.207
So, uh, she always considered
this project, this hospital

12:32.207 --> 12:35.138
to be her baby. Our baby.

12:36.775 --> 12:40.548
- If in 100 years...
- He didn't love her.

12:40.548 --> 12:44.188
- How do you know?
- I know.

12:44.188 --> 12:48.411
...with my casinos or my bestseller books.

12:48.411 --> 12:52.185
No, it will be for this hospital.

12:52.185 --> 12:55.694
So let's get started on this hospital.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.847
Will somebody hold this?

13:03.505 --> 13:05.185
- What are you doing?
- Poking around.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.602
- You can't do that.
- I can do anything I want.

13:07.602 --> 13:10.258
I'm cute.

13:12.550 --> 13:15.858
I wanna thank everybody
for coming out here today.

13:15.858 --> 13:19.697
So let's get this thing built, huh?

13:19.697 --> 13:21.298
Well, thanks, I appreciate that.

13:21.298 --> 13:23.530
Uh, Mr. Thorn, do you have a minute?

13:23.530 --> 13:24.579
Yeah, sure.

13:24.579 --> 13:26.439
No, no, no, sir,
we don't want your autograph.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.013
My name is Natalie Teeger,
this is Adrian Monk.

13:29.013 --> 13:31.871
We're here with some homicide
detectives from San Francisco.

13:31.871 --> 13:34.148
Oh, I hope you're staying
here at the Monticello.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.678
Yes, sir, we are.

13:35.678 --> 13:38.213
We just have some questions about your wife.

13:38.213 --> 13:40.750
And how she died.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.529
You do?

13:42.529 --> 13:45.485
Well, uh, we have our
own police force here, Mr. Monk,

13:45.485 --> 13:49.153
and, uh, they've already looked into it.
If you want a copy of that report,

13:49.153 --> 13:50.590
I can assist you with that.

13:50.590 --> 13:54.711
Well, I-I've already seen the report, sir.

13:54.711 --> 13:56.995
It doesn't add up.

13:56.995 --> 13:59.471
- Oh, yeah? What doesn't add up?
- The night she died,

13:59.471 --> 14:03.018
the two of you were going to a fundraiser
at the Baker Street Pavilion.

14:03.018 --> 14:06.823
Yeah, that's right. It was a
fundraising concert. For this hospital.

14:06.823 --> 14:11.521
Right, but she forgot the tickets
and that's why she went back upstairs.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.415
Yeah.

14:14.415 --> 14:18.641
These were in your pocket, sir.

14:18.641 --> 14:22.946
Baker Street Pavilion, May 2.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.607
Oh, my, well, uh...
I didn't realize they were there.

14:25.607 --> 14:28.051
You know, if I'd have known that,
she'd be alive here today.

14:28.051 --> 14:30.668
We've spoken to some witnesses.

14:30.668 --> 14:32.907
They said that you looked for the tickets.

14:32.907 --> 14:35.252
They said that you checked your pockets.

14:35.252 --> 14:38.562
They were mistaken!

14:40.342 --> 14:43.045
Look, why... why don't you
just relax here, Mr. Monk, huh?

14:43.045 --> 14:46.241
You're in Las Vegas,
do some gambling.

14:46.241 --> 14:48.471
I'd be happy to comp
you and your friend here.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.455
I don't gamble.

14:50.455 --> 14:52.300
Well, then have a drink.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.956
Don't drink.

14:53.956 --> 14:55.811
Well, you don't gamble,
you don't drink.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.946
You wanna know a secret?
I don't, either.

14:58.946 --> 15:00.829
You and I, we got a lot in common, Mr. Monk.

15:00.829 --> 15:05.490
Yes, we do.
My wife was murdered, too.

15:05.490 --> 15:08.971
- No, Sheryl wasn't murdered.
- I think she was.

15:08.971 --> 15:11.919
We're done here.

15:11.919 --> 15:17.056
- Goodbye, Mr. Monk. Miss Teeger.
- Mr. Thorn.

15:22.914 --> 15:25.852
Okay, just take your time.
Does any of this look familiar?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.843
Maybe that way.

15:31.094 --> 15:34.200
Hey, there's Randy. Randy!
Randy! How you doin'?

15:34.200 --> 15:37.771
Hey, uh, I'm down.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.041
But that's to be expected.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.527
Money is like the tide,
it ebbs and it flows.

15:42.527 --> 15:45.150
It's all in the book.
Right now, I'm, uh, sort of ebbing.

15:45.150 --> 15:47.971
Uh, son, exactly how much are you ebbing?

15:47.971 --> 15:49.188
Down $800.

15:49.188 --> 15:52.584
But that's not including the complimentary
breakfast and all the free drinks.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.104
Don't panic. Don't panic.
The worst thing you can do is panic.

15:55.104 --> 15:57.353
It's all in the book.
Hey, uh, how's the case coming?

15:57.353 --> 15:59.212
- Actually, we're narrowing it.
- Great. Great.

15:59.212 --> 16:01.084
I want to hear all about it later.

16:01.084 --> 16:03.282
- How are you?
- Julie, I'm back.

16:03.282 --> 16:04.653
- Let's play.
- All right, here you go.

16:04.653 --> 16:09.934
That bar.
I've been in that bar.

16:14.593 --> 16:17.381
Hey, there he is.
This is the guy.

16:17.381 --> 16:19.069
Hey, Leland, welcome back.

16:19.069 --> 16:22.748
- Yeah, I think you've been here before.
- Hey, Leland, how you feeling, brother?

16:22.748 --> 16:26.393
I figured you'd be back.
You forgot this.

16:26.393 --> 16:31.286
- Everybody is still talking about it, man.
- Thank you for last night.

16:31.286 --> 16:32.740
You're welcome.

16:32.740 --> 16:35.663
- "First place, karaoke contest"?
- Karaoke.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.528
Do you sing?

16:37.528 --> 16:39.759
Apparently.

16:41.061 --> 16:44.773
Look, last night is a bit of a blur.

16:44.773 --> 16:46.249
What did I sing?

16:46.249 --> 16:48.847
Ain't No Sunshine.

16:48.847 --> 16:50.347
That's a good song.

16:50.347 --> 16:52.680
You made me cry.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.925
Sing it again.

16:54.925 --> 16:58.572
I don't think so. Look, um...

16:58.572 --> 17:00.628
Did anything else happen?
It's kind of important.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.193
You did a lot of drinkin'.
You were very thirsty.

17:03.193 --> 17:06.048
- Did he talk to anybody?
- Hell, he talked to everybody.

17:06.048 --> 17:07.808
You don't remember anything?

17:07.808 --> 17:08.990
- Um...
- Let's see.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.271
You came in around 2:00,
you sang the song,

17:11.271 --> 17:12.858
you won the trophy,
you threw up,

17:12.858 --> 17:15.838
and you collapsed on a table over there.

17:15.838 --> 17:17.525
- Was he alone?
- I didn't notice.

17:17.525 --> 17:20.894
About 10 minutes later you came back,
you were all excited and you kept saying,

17:20.894 --> 17:23.001
"I solved the case!"

17:23.001 --> 17:23.957
Anything else?

17:23.957 --> 17:26.718
No, sir, you just ran outside
looking for a payphone.

17:26.718 --> 17:31.361
You sat at this table and you solved the case.

17:33.434 --> 17:36.756
Look, do you have any idea what I meant?

17:36.756 --> 17:42.170
- No.
- I do. You told me all about it.

17:47.168 --> 17:51.087
Um...

17:51.087 --> 17:55.869
What exactly did I say?

17:55.869 --> 18:00.432
I'll tell you on one condition.

18:09.549 --> 18:10.943
Hi. Remember me?

18:10.943 --> 18:13.184
Oh, Miss Teeger. Room 1523.

18:13.184 --> 18:16.103
Wow. You're pretty good.
You're gonna own this place someday.

18:16.103 --> 18:18.299
That's the plan. Give me five years.

18:18.299 --> 18:20.487
Listen, my friend Adrian Monk
just checked in...

18:20.487 --> 18:22.187
Room 1525.

18:22.187 --> 18:25.894
That's right. Anyway, uh,
he's a little peculiar.

18:25.894 --> 18:28.330
He has to have 60-watt
light bulbs in all the lamps.

18:28.330 --> 18:31.242
60-watt?
Did you try Guest Services?

18:31.242 --> 18:32.977
Yeah, there were 10 people in front of me.

18:32.977 --> 18:35.453
Could you help me out?
I would so appreciate it.

18:35.453 --> 18:36.911
Done. But you owe me one.

18:36.911 --> 18:40.098
All right.

18:40.098 --> 18:42.246
- Is that Daniel Thorn's book?
- Oh, yeah.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.169
You must be a pretty big fan, huh?

18:44.169 --> 18:46.936
I'd say I'm more of a student.
I keep my eyes open.

18:46.936 --> 18:50.880
You can learn more in this lobby
than you can at any business school.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.594
I'm sure you can, Lewis.

18:54.594 --> 18:57.257
I bet you have some great stories.

18:57.257 --> 19:00.712
Well, uh...Let's just say
if I wrote a book about Thorn,

19:00.712 --> 19:04.401
about the things I've seen,
it'd be pretty wild.

19:04.401 --> 19:07.569
I have a perfect view of who comes and goes.

19:07.569 --> 19:10.244
And who comes and goes with who.

19:10.244 --> 19:15.337
- Ah. Do you really?
- Mmm.

20:20.451 --> 20:25.123
I sang the song, now tell me
what I said last night.

20:25.123 --> 20:28.250
All you said was,
"They don't match."

20:28.250 --> 20:30.254
"They don't match"?
What doesn't match?

20:30.254 --> 20:34.363
I don't know. You didn't say.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.543
Wait, wait, wait, is that it?
Is that all you got?

20:37.543 --> 20:39.932
Leland. Sing it again.

20:39.932 --> 20:44.621
I just love the way you sing.

20:48.602 --> 20:50.284
Thank you.

20:50.284 --> 20:53.010
- You were good.
- Shut up.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.730
Daniel Thorn has a mistress.

20:54.730 --> 20:57.593
She's a dancer at another casino.

20:57.593 --> 20:58.789
How do you know that?

20:58.789 --> 21:00.314
Lewis the bellboy told me.

21:00.314 --> 21:02.411
He told you just like that?

21:02.411 --> 21:05.238

Well, you can't argue with that.
They are naked-ish. Where's the Captain?

21:22.708 --> 21:24.631
He went back to get Randy out of the casino.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.049
He's down $4,000.

21:27.049 --> 21:29.486
What, he's never gonna leave.
Nobody walks away.

21:29.486 --> 21:33.187
It's like a drug.
I used to gamble.

21:33.187 --> 21:35.855
I had a big problem.
That's why I left.

21:35.855 --> 21:38.516
- Sir, Teresa Telenko?
- Yeah.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.842
- Is he pointing?
- Yes, he's pointing.

21:40.842 --> 21:44.388
- Where is he pointing?
- To a woman.

21:49.531 --> 21:52.003
She's walking this way.

21:54.785 --> 21:56.738
Excuse me, uh, Miss Telenko.

21:56.738 --> 21:59.273
Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger,
this is Adrian Monk.

21:59.273 --> 22:02.072
We're, uh, working
with the police department,

22:02.072 --> 22:05.922
looking into the death of Sheryl Thorn.

22:05.922 --> 22:09.460
- Why are you telling me?
- Because you're sleeping with her husband.

22:09.460 --> 22:13.700
Sweetie, it'll take us half a day
to check your phone records.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.908
Okay, maybe that's true.
But that's my business.

22:16.908 --> 22:19.624
Has nothing to do with his wife or what happened.

22:19.624 --> 22:21.776
Miss Telenko, we already checked.

22:21.776 --> 22:24.186
The night Mrs. Thorn was killed,

22:24.186 --> 22:28.965
you called in sick.
You missed the show.

22:28.965 --> 22:32.685
- Is he blind?
- Define "blind."
- *

22:32.685 --> 22:35.272
I... I called in sick because I was sick.

22:35.272 --> 22:36.846
I miss a lot of shows.

22:36.846 --> 22:39.975
Would you like to see a note from my doctor?

22:39.975 --> 22:42.548
What happened to Sheryl Thorn was an accident.

22:42.548 --> 22:44.781
She was on that elevator alone
and she choked to death.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.694
I don't think so.

22:48.906 --> 22:52.530
Look, if you're gonna accuse me of something,
the least you can do is look me in the eye.

22:52.530 --> 22:55.142
Mr. Monk, come on.

22:56.964 --> 22:58.805
Thorn killed her.

22:58.805 --> 23:01.177
I don't know how he did it,

23:01.177 --> 23:03.956
but he did it.

23:03.956 --> 23:08.008
I think you knew something about it,
either before the fact or after.

23:08.008 --> 23:10.808
Are you arresting me?

23:10.808 --> 23:12.304
No.

23:12.304 --> 23:15.416
Then I have a show to do.
Excuse me.

23:15.416 --> 23:18.095
Miss Telenko.

23:18.095 --> 23:20.626
When you talk to Mr. Thorn,

23:20.626 --> 23:23.976
you tell him that I'm not going anywhere.

23:23.976 --> 23:28.156
Tell him that he's smart,
but I'm smarter.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.478
And I am gonna figure out how he did it.

23:33.789 --> 23:36.015
Is she still there?

23:42.764 --> 23:45.325
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I sent him out.

23:45.325 --> 23:47.675
I told him I needed a special kind of shampoo.

23:47.675 --> 23:50.185
Boy, it's like you have superpowers.

23:50.185 --> 23:51.865
It's a gift.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.369
- And a curse?
- No, just a gift.

23:54.369 --> 23:56.147
All right, we have about 10 minutes.

23:56.147 --> 23:58.061
Let me have the scarf.

24:08.525 --> 24:11.231
What are you doing? - We're reenacting
the crime. You're the victim.

24:11.231 --> 24:13.458
What if... What if the elevator starts up?
It'll get caught again.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.301
It's not gonna get caught.

24:15.301 --> 24:16.197
Then you be the victim.

24:16.197 --> 24:19.014
No, no, no, uh,
Sharona was always the victim.

24:19.014 --> 24:22.645
- Yeah, I'm sure she was.
- No, l... I can't be the victim.

24:22.645 --> 24:24.527
I'm the detective.

24:24.527 --> 24:26.911
I have to step back and observe the scene.

24:26.911 --> 24:29.020
Yeah, well, I can observe stuff, too.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.066
- A: This is a crime scene...
- No, no, no, no, you don't look...

24:32.066 --> 24:33.706
You don't know what to look for. Okay?

24:33.706 --> 24:38.256
I mean, we have a system.
It's a good system.

24:38.256 --> 24:41.013
There's an old saying:

24:41.013 --> 24:46.317
"Don't change anything ever."

24:46.317 --> 24:50.006
- That's an old saying?
- I've been saying it for years.

24:54.624 --> 24:57.903
I know it's only $2 million.
But $2 million here,

24:57.903 --> 25:02.113
$4 million there, after a while,
we're talkin' about real money.

25:02.113 --> 25:05.491
Yeah, the answer is no.

25:05.491 --> 25:07.357
Okay, I'm Mrs. Thorn.

25:07.357 --> 25:09.959
W-w-w-wait.

25:09.959 --> 25:11.730
Oh, looks fantastic on you,
by the way.

25:11.730 --> 25:15.369
All right, all right.
We walk out.

25:15.369 --> 25:19.066
We stop. I forgot the tickets.

25:19.066 --> 25:21.030
We look for the tickets.

25:21.030 --> 25:23.439
I must've left them upstairs.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.055
I walk back to the elevator.

25:26.055 --> 25:28.569
I press "P" for penthouse.

25:28.569 --> 25:32.678
The doors close.
The scarf gets caught.

25:32.678 --> 25:36.412
Maybe somebody was hiding up there.

25:36.412 --> 25:38.393
Well, that's possible.

25:38.393 --> 25:40.663
But Mrs. Thorn was yelling about the scarf,

25:40.663 --> 25:42.590
not... not about some attacker.

25:42.590 --> 25:44.417
Yeah.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.551
So she's alone.

25:46.551 --> 25:50.115
She presses her thumb.

25:54.604 --> 25:56.815
Mr. Monk! Oh, my God!
Here, I have a knife.

25:56.815 --> 25:59.825
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on!

26:08.618 --> 26:12.205
Almost got it. Almost got it.

26:12.205 --> 26:14.256
Okay, you're there,
you're there!

26:14.256 --> 26:16.099
What are you doing, huh?

26:16.099 --> 26:17.859
Do you think this is funny?

26:17.859 --> 26:20.218
I mean, you... you...
you rifle through my pockets.

26:20.218 --> 26:24.445
- You're stepping on it.
- You make a mockery of me like this.

26:24.445 --> 26:25.926
I just buried my wife.

26:25.926 --> 26:28.839
We are not mocking you, Mr. Thorn,
we are trying an experiment.

26:28.839 --> 26:32.523
I could have you arrested and I'm going to.

26:32.523 --> 26:35.526
Are you okay?
Do you need some water?

26:35.526 --> 26:39.966
- No, I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Okay.

26:42.194 --> 26:44.260
What?

26:45.809 --> 26:47.256
- Questions.
- Questions for me?

26:47.256 --> 26:50.569
No, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm on my way
to a board meeting. I'm already late.

26:50.569 --> 26:53.401
It won't take a minute.
One... One minute.

26:53.401 --> 26:55.362
Did I do something to offend you, sir?

26:55.362 --> 26:57.438
I mean, why don't you let this thing go?

26:57.438 --> 26:59.868
What happened to my wife was an accident.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.590
10 witnesses saw her
get onto the elevator alone.

27:03.590 --> 27:05.633
When it stopped, she was dead.

27:05.633 --> 27:11.668
They said your wife was screaming for help.

27:11.668 --> 27:14.544
And that she called your name.

27:14.544 --> 27:16.101
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.596
I... I will never forget that moment.

27:18.596 --> 27:23.962
But just now, I was being
strangled by the scarf like your wife,

27:23.962 --> 27:26.086
but I couldn't yell anything.

27:26.086 --> 27:28.681
I... I couldn't even breathe.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.300
How do you explain that, sir?

27:31.300 --> 27:33.211
I can't explain it. Can you?

27:33.211 --> 27:35.568
I loved my wife, Mr. Monk.

27:35.568 --> 27:39.314
- As much as you loved Terri Telenko?
- Yeah, I know you talked to Terri.

27:39.314 --> 27:41.491
Virtue was not one of my virtues,

27:41.491 --> 27:44.217
and, uh, Sheryl knew that.
Uh, she accepted it.

27:44.217 --> 27:48.118
And, you know, she realized that being
married to Daniel Thorn in this town

27:48.118 --> 27:50.672
had other compensations.

27:50.672 --> 27:54.989
Now you, you don't have any idea
who you're dealing with, do you?

27:54.989 --> 27:57.907
Come here.
Let... Let me show you somethin'.

27:59.788 --> 28:04.479
The local rag put this picture
on the front page.

28:04.479 --> 28:07.162
Now, I asked them not to publish it
and they ignored me.

28:07.162 --> 28:10.925
So yesterday morning, I bought
controlling interest in that company

28:10.925 --> 28:17.396
so I could personally fire
that son of a bitch editor
and the photographer and the publisher.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.783
Now you understand?
Now, that's who you're dealing with.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.512
I own this town.

28:23.512 --> 28:27.242
Now, Miss Teeger,
you worked at the Bellagio.

28:27.242 --> 28:29.217
All right, so you've done your homework.

28:29.217 --> 28:32.341
Yes, so why don't you tell your friend
what the first rule of Vegas is?

28:32.341 --> 28:36.704
The golden rule.
The only rule.

28:36.704 --> 28:39.628
The house always wins.

28:39.628 --> 28:42.118
Always.

28:44.903 --> 28:48.190
- Ah, there it is.
- It's ruined now. You cut it all up.

28:48.190 --> 28:49.930
- I saved your life.
- You could have untied it.

28:49.930 --> 28:52.648
Hey, Monk, Natalie,
I've been looking all over for you guys.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.651
It's Randy,
he's in way over his head.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.880
He's lost his savings account,
he's gonna lose everything.

29:05.749 --> 29:08.795
- Hit me.
- Sorry, sir, that's a bust.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.962
It's blackjack. You try to get as
close to 21 without going over.

29:20.962 --> 29:22.988
Yeah, I think I've heard of that game.

29:22.988 --> 29:24.871
It's not a game, believe me.

29:24.871 --> 29:27.109
- Hey, Lieutenant, let's go take a break.
- Not now.

29:34.978 --> 29:37.919
Hold on.

29:41.575 --> 29:43.126
Hit me.

29:43.126 --> 29:45.027
Sorry, sir.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.679
Hit me.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.228
Eight. 11.
8, 11...

30:09.228 --> 30:10.577
Hit me.

30:10.577 --> 30:12.661
16.

30:14.158 --> 30:15.433
Hit me.

30:15.433 --> 30:18.225
26, that's a bust.

30:18.225 --> 30:21.107
So, exactly how much are you down?

30:21.107 --> 30:23.522
- $35,000.
- $35,000?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.243
Where did you get $35,000?

30:25.243 --> 30:28.740
It's easy. They lend it to you.
Yeah, I'm in.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.404
- Stay.
- No, take... take a card.

30:43.404 --> 30:44.943
No, he's got 18.
You don't hit on 18.

30:44.943 --> 30:50.438
The next card's low.
It's a three, or maybe a two.

30:50.438 --> 30:54.317
- Are you counting cards?
- No. I'm remembering them.

30:54.317 --> 30:55.647
What do you mean
you're remembering them?

30:55.647 --> 30:58.563
That's impossible.
There are eight decks in that shoe.

31:00.083 --> 31:03.644
One card, please. Hit him.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.954
Take the card.

31:07.954 --> 31:10.323
Sir?

31:10.323 --> 31:12.876
Hit me.

31:27.751 --> 31:29.937
I don't know what happened.

31:29.937 --> 31:32.006
I was on fire!
I... I couldn't lose.

31:32.006 --> 31:34.191
I was up almost $8,000

31:34.191 --> 31:38.495
and then I started to double and triple my bets,
just like it says in the book.

31:38.495 --> 31:41.520
- The next thing I knew...
- Let me see the book, Randy.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.605
Let me see it.

31:45.569 --> 31:47.135
Whoa, whoa. W-What are you...
What are you doing?

31:47.135 --> 31:49.259
How am I gonna win my money back?

31:49.259 --> 31:50.366
You stay there.

31:50.366 --> 31:55.084
If you go near those tables again without me,
I will shoot you in the leg.

31:59.590 --> 32:02.382
Well, a very good friend of mine
has a gambling problem.

32:02.382 --> 32:04.407
I need to do an intervention.

32:04.407 --> 32:06.475
Maybe Randy could find a support group.

32:06.475 --> 32:09.021
I'm talking about you, Monk.

32:09.021 --> 32:11.827
- Me? I don't gamble.
- Yeah, that's a problem.

32:11.827 --> 32:13.546
You should gamble.

32:13.546 --> 32:16.592
See, you could be in there right now,
gambling, winning his money back.

32:16.592 --> 32:18.169
You can't be serious.

32:18.169 --> 32:20.517
Monk, the kid is $35,000 in the hole.

32:20.517 --> 32:22.517
That is his savings account,

32:22.517 --> 32:27.987
his car payment, and the down payment
on his mother's condominium.

32:29.056 --> 32:31.922
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. I just saw you.

32:31.922 --> 32:34.378
Mr. Monk, don't listen to him.

32:34.378 --> 32:36.975
Look, just... You do that Rain Man thing.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.982
Count a few cards.
It'll take you an hour-and-a-half.

32:38.982 --> 32:41.797
No, no, no, look at me.
He has no idea what he's talking about.

32:41.797 --> 32:44.230
Once you get a taste of it,
you will be hooked for sure.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.241
- You'll never leave.
- You won't get hooked.

32:46.241 --> 32:49.296
He gets hooked on everything.
He's the most compulsive person I've ever met.

32:49.296 --> 32:51.496
- He's like a different species.
- Thank you.

32:51.496 --> 32:53.743
I'll be with you the whole time.

32:53.743 --> 32:57.935
We go in there, win the $35,000 back,
and then we walk away.

32:57.935 --> 33:01.771
Nobody walks away.
Mr. Monk, don't do it.

33:01.771 --> 33:06.446
Mr. Monk, it's Randy.

33:09.853 --> 33:12.114
I have to do it.
It's Randy.

33:12.114 --> 33:15.728
And then I'll walk away, I promise.

33:53.614 --> 33:57.012
Can I have a different chip?
This one's scratched.

34:01.054 --> 34:04.237
- It's his first time.
- No kidding.

34:05.182 --> 34:08.306
Don't even think about it.

34:15.991 --> 34:17.751
14.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.755
16.

34:19.755 --> 34:21.156
20.

34:22.885 --> 34:25.978
25, you bust.

34:25.978 --> 34:29.882
- You hit 20?
- I did?

34:31.764 --> 34:34.565
I'm going to need more money.

34:37.931 --> 34:40.529
Stay. Hit me. Hit me.

34:40.529 --> 34:42.266
Stay.

34:42.266 --> 34:44.012
Stay. Stay.

34:44.012 --> 34:45.708
Hit me. Hit me.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.679
Stay.

34:49.257 --> 34:52.260
Hit me. Stay.

34:52.260 --> 34:55.914
I wanna raise my bets. Hit me.

34:55.914 --> 34:59.954
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

34:59.954 --> 35:02.809
Nicely played.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.741
Hit me. Stay. Double down.

35:06.741 --> 35:09.356
Sweet. Stay. Hit me.

35:09.356 --> 35:12.597
Hit me. Stay.

35:14.236 --> 35:17.519
- How you doing?
- Good. I'm up $19,400.

35:17.519 --> 35:18.920
I mean, how are you doing?

35:18.920 --> 35:22.776
I'm good. I'm... I'm...
I'm okay. I'm okay.

35:22.776 --> 35:25.384
Monk, I really appreciate this.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.673
I'm never gambling again for as long as I live.

35:27.673 --> 35:29.890
- Wanna bet?
- $1,000?

35:29.890 --> 35:32.341
Sorry.

35:35.288 --> 35:37.444
We can't cover that.
There's a $500 limit.

35:37.444 --> 35:40.874
I think we can make
an exception in Mr. Monk's case.

35:40.874 --> 35:43.220
I mean, we're not afraid of him,
are we? Nah.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.104
You're the boss.

35:45.104 --> 35:48.948
But first, let's make it a little more interesting.
Why don't you add two more decks to the shoe?

35:48.948 --> 35:49.878
Yes, sir.

35:49.878 --> 35:53.335
Mr. Monk, that's 10 decks.
That's too many.

36:01.245 --> 36:01.982
Bring it.

36:01.982 --> 36:05.464
If you're trying to cheat me,
Mr. Monk, we'll catch you.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.884
I got friends hiding in the ceiling.

36:08.884 --> 36:11.366
Friends in the ceiling?

36:11.366 --> 36:13.532
That's right.

36:18.836 --> 36:22.326
There's an access panel above.

36:25.918 --> 36:29.265
I know how you did it.

36:29.265 --> 36:31.737
I know how he did it.

36:31.737 --> 36:33.483
He murdered his wife.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.631
Good for him.
Congratulations.

36:35.631 --> 36:37.045
Let's play cards.

36:37.045 --> 36:40.157
Stay. Hit me.
Here's what happened.

36:40.157 --> 36:42.390
You and your wife went out to that fundraiser.

36:42.390 --> 36:45.496
She left the penthouse with you,
but she never made it downstairs.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.459
You killed her in the elevator on the way down.

36:48.459 --> 36:50.941
You had less than two minutes,
that's all the time you needed.

36:50.941 --> 36:55.351
After all, you had help.

36:55.351 --> 36:58.076
- Are you going to play or not?
- Sorry. Hit me.

36:58.076 --> 37:02.347
This man is delusional. He was discharged
from the police force six years ago.

37:02.347 --> 37:07.578
- He's not even a real cop.
- Yeah, that's true. But we are. Go on.

37:07.578 --> 37:10.350
That wasn't your wife in the lobby.
That was Teresa Telenko,

37:10.350 --> 37:12.370
your mistress in disguise.

37:12.370 --> 37:14.422
Come on, hit me! Stay!

37:14.422 --> 37:16.611
Teresa was a trained actress.

37:16.611 --> 37:19.916
Is that why you seduced her
in the first place, I wonder?

37:19.916 --> 37:22.592
I'll split these.

37:22.592 --> 37:24.862
Stay. Hit me.

37:24.862 --> 37:27.068
Double down. Hit me.

37:27.068 --> 37:30.235
You hoisted her up through the access panel.

37:30.235 --> 37:32.912
Hit me again.
And make it a 10.

37:32.912 --> 37:33.884
Genius!

37:33.884 --> 37:36.819
What is that, 17? I'll stay.
Hit me.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.741
Then Teresa took
your wife's place in the elevator.

37:39.741 --> 37:42.806
You had 45 seconds.
That was plenty of time.

37:42.806 --> 37:45.972
Hit me and hit me.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.057
Stay. Stay.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.997
The elevator door opened,
and you two went into your act.

37:51.997 --> 37:54.884
$2,000, uptown and down.
Let's keep it sassy.

37:54.884 --> 37:56.378
Sure you wanna do that?
You said you'd quit.

37:56.378 --> 37:58.200
Natalie, I know what I'm doing.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.574
When the door closed again,
Teresa started to scream your name.

38:01.574 --> 38:03.274
Whoa. Blackjack.

38:03.274 --> 38:07.270
I believe that's the name of the game.
Sheryl was already dead
when she pressed the glass.

38:07.270 --> 38:08.886
That's why her thumbprint was upside down.

38:08.886 --> 38:12.296
Wait. I wanna raise my bets.

38:12.296 --> 38:15.788
You said it yourself,
you have friends hiding in the ceiling.

38:15.788 --> 38:20.227
It was a perfect plan.
Everybody knew Sheryl was always
catching her scarf on something.

38:20.227 --> 38:22.742
Nobody was surprised when it happened again.

38:22.742 --> 38:27.577
This is a very interesting fairytale,
Mr. Monk, but that's all it is: A fairytale.

38:27.577 --> 38:30.214
There might be something in
the elevator shaft: Blood, hair.

38:30.214 --> 38:32.994
You'd need a court order to even look.

38:32.994 --> 38:35.580
Which you're not gonna get,
not in this town.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.252
So, unless you got something else...

38:37.252 --> 38:40.556
I did, I had it.
I had proof, I just can't remember it.

38:40.556 --> 38:44.064
It doesn't matter.
You're leaving anyway.

38:48.352 --> 38:50.610
This man here is cheating.
He's been counting cards.

38:50.610 --> 38:52.292
I want him and his friends out of here now.

38:52.292 --> 38:53.638
Wait, wait, wait!
10 more minutes.

38:53.638 --> 38:55.249
I'm on fire here.
Look, double down!

38:55.249 --> 38:57.703
No, no, no,
I told you, Mr. Monk.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.967
The house always wins.

39:09.327 --> 39:11.536
- Hey!
- Trust me, even is better.

39:11.536 --> 39:14.540
- No more bets.
- What the hell?

39:18.907 --> 39:22.428
33 black.

39:22.428 --> 39:26.095
- Hey, man. That's for you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

39:29.709 --> 39:32.633
- But you said you'd walk away.
- I did. I walked away.

39:32.633 --> 39:35.996
You were dragged away, Mr. Monk.

39:35.996 --> 39:40.593
- Should we call Lt. Waliver?
- He can't do anything without proof.

39:40.593 --> 39:42.909
That game with the dice,
that looks like a lot of fun.

39:42.909 --> 39:44.858
Craps? Yeah.

39:44.858 --> 39:47.590
Craps, I can show you how to play that.
I got a great book. - Okay.

39:47.590 --> 39:50.524
- Probably still have a little bit of time.
- Randy, give me the money.

39:50.524 --> 39:53.023
- You'll get it back when you get home.
- I'm not 10 years old.

39:53.023 --> 39:56.027
Yeah, that's true.
Give me the money.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.507
Mr. Stottlemeyer.

39:57.507 --> 39:59.471
Here.

40:00.336 --> 40:03.605
Groundskeeping found these in the bushes.

40:03.605 --> 40:06.746
Are they yours?

40:08.769 --> 40:10.939
- Yeah, these are my pants.
- Well, don't worry, sir.

40:10.939 --> 40:14.548
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

40:16.024 --> 40:18.149
Monk.

40:21.826 --> 40:23.564
This is it.

40:23.564 --> 40:25.878
Remember I was saying
that they didn't match?

40:25.878 --> 40:28.184
I was talking about the pictures.

40:28.184 --> 40:29.786
Look, look, look, look, look.

40:29.786 --> 40:32.317
See, that's her body, right?
She's wearing hoop earrings.

40:32.317 --> 40:36.354
- So?
- So, check this out.

40:36.354 --> 40:39.235
Moments before she gets on the elevator...

40:39.235 --> 40:41.811
- Different earrings.
- Different girl.

40:41.811 --> 40:44.471
I'll call Waliver.
That's enough for a search warrant.

40:44.471 --> 40:50.893
How many people read this paper?
50,000. Nobody else caught it.

40:50.893 --> 40:55.172
So, that means
if... if I'm drunk as a skunk,

40:55.172 --> 40:57.876
completely plastered,
I'm as smart as you.

40:57.876 --> 41:00.365
Smarter.

41:10.257 --> 41:12.483
They found hair and rope fiber
on top of the elevator.

41:12.483 --> 41:16.710
With that and those photographs,
we got him.

41:17.926 --> 41:20.646
- Mr. Monk.
- Daniel.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.380
Don't go now, Mr. Monk.

41:22.380 --> 41:25.290
This game of ours is far from over, my friend.

41:25.290 --> 41:27.475
I will be out by tomorrow morning.

41:27.475 --> 41:29.619
I wouldn't bet on it.

41:29.619 --> 41:32.216
Hey, Professor.

41:32.216 --> 41:36.021
I'm playing a few hands.
Should I save you a seat?

41:36.021 --> 41:38.195
I can't, thanks.

41:38.195 --> 41:42.346
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.734
You said you gambled?

41:45.734 --> 41:48.732
I couldn't stop. I was a mess.

41:48.732 --> 41:51.377
But you walked away.
How did you do it?

41:51.377 --> 41:55.471
I had Mitch. How did you do it?

41:55.471 --> 41:58.537
I have you.
