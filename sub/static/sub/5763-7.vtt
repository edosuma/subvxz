00:13.067 --> 00:15.433
No! Jim!

00:32.401 --> 00:34.434
Melinda?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.867
Hey, what is this place?

00:40.867 --> 00:42.967
Where am I?

00:44.900 --> 00:47.668
Not even a hello for your big brother?

00:47.668 --> 00:49.167
Dan?

00:49.167 --> 00:51.501
Man, I've been waiting here for hours.

00:52.334 --> 00:53.467
Hours?

00:53.467 --> 00:56.267
Hours, years, who knows. It's all the same.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.434
But I have been waiting for you.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.267
Dan, why are we here?

01:00.267 --> 01:02.134
Don't you recognize this place?

01:02.134 --> 01:03.967
Dad used to bring you here.

01:03.967 --> 01:05.668
Whenever you needed cheering up.

01:05.668 --> 01:07.051
You guys used to fish here,

01:07.051 --> 01:10.434
or just dangle your feet off the pier and talk.

01:10.434 --> 01:12.301
We came here when you died.

01:12.301 --> 01:15.501
I know. I was watching.

01:17.501 --> 01:20.067
Now we can go.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.467
Go where, dan?

01:21.467 --> 01:23.501
Duh. Into the light.

01:23.501 --> 01:24.933
I'm supposed to bring you over,

01:24.933 --> 01:27.334
That's what I've been waiting for.

01:27.334 --> 01:29.567
The old man told me, "next time I see you guys,

01:29.567 --> 01:31.800
I want to see you together."

01:31.800 --> 01:33.301
Dad's there?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.800
I've only seen a glimpse of him.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.734
He also told me

01:37.034 --> 01:39.668
I can finally lose the penguin suit when we cross over.

01:39.668 --> 01:40.933
So let's go.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.334
Dan, I can't.

01:42.334 --> 01:43.967
I have to see Melinda.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.933
Jim, Melinda's gonna be fine.

01:45.933 --> 01:47.567
Fine? No, she's not fine.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.334
She's a wreck! I have to see her. I have to talk to her...

01:49.334 --> 01:50.967
No, you don't, Jim. Trust me, you don't.

01:50.967 --> 01:52.601
- She's expecting me... - Jim, listen to me!

01:52.601 --> 01:56.768
Does Melinda know that you love her?

01:56.768 --> 01:57.850
Does everyone you care about

01:57.850 --> 02:00.333
know how much you care about them?

02:00.433 --> 02:02.267
Yeah, I think so.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.367
Then you're done.

02:05.601 --> 02:07.467
You're ready to cross over.

02:11.567 --> 02:14.301
No.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.867
I can't leave Melinda.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.933
Well, do what you gotta do, brother.

03:14.134 --> 03:15.367
That's it. We lost him.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.401
Ned honey, why don't you go and see if there's any recycling

03:34.401 --> 03:36.800
that needs to go out, or any mail.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.601
No, it's fine.

03:39.601 --> 03:41.467
Don't worry about that stuff.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.768
More tea?

03:43.768 --> 03:45.601
I can't believe I haven't seen him.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.833
He isn't coming to me. It's been 2 days.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.134
Maybe...

03:50.134 --> 03:53.367
I don't know. Maybe he crossed over.

03:53.367 --> 03:57.367
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.

03:59.134 --> 04:01.067
But wouldn't he have said goodbye?

04:01.067 --> 04:04.267
I mean, he wouldn't just leave, would he?

04:04.267 --> 04:06.434
Thanks for pointing that out.

04:08.334 --> 04:10.334
Haven't you even felt anything?

04:10.334 --> 04:11.800
Mel, I'm here.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.434
Like a presence or something?

04:13.434 --> 04:14.467
I'm right here with you.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.000
I haven't seen a ghost since Jim died.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.668
Not that I want to.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.933
Honey, we have to settle on a date for the funeral.

04:24.933 --> 04:26.434
I can't.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.800
It's too final. I just can't.

04:41.701 --> 04:42.967
Jim?

04:42.967 --> 04:45.234
Mel, it's not me.

04:45.501 --> 04:46.800
Do you see a ghost?

04:48.301 --> 04:50.000
I'm right here.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.601
I don't see anything.

05:05.768 --> 05:07.734
He's here.

05:07.734 --> 05:10.367
No, it's not me!

05:10.667 --> 05:12.267
It's not!

05:12.567 --> 05:15.434
Melinda, why can't you see me?

05:26.734 --> 05:28.634
Thank you, ma'am.

05:36.567 --> 05:38.001
Mom.

07:11.101 --> 07:13.333
Everyone's so sad.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.367
It sucks, I know.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.067
But you have to believe

07:16.067 --> 07:18.967
that they're all going to be all right.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.534
It's not your job to take care of them anymore.

07:21.534 --> 07:23.333
They'll take care of each other now.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.834
Melinda can't see me.

07:25.834 --> 07:28.467
She doesn't even know I'm there.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.001
It's her grief.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.634
It makes the veil stronger.

07:31.634 --> 07:35.567
It blocks her gift because this is so personal for her.

07:35.567 --> 07:38.200
When she finds some joy again, it'll come back.

07:40.134 --> 07:41.701
I can't leave her like this.

07:41.701 --> 07:43.701
She needs closure. We both do.

07:43.701 --> 07:44.767
Jim, here's the thing.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.434
You're on the threshold.

07:46.434 --> 07:49.867
If you don't come soon...

07:49.867 --> 07:52.467
well, let's just say I can't wait much longer.

08:08.134 --> 08:10.600
I don't know if this will ever go away.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.934
This feeling.

08:12.934 --> 08:16.168
I miss you so much.

08:16.168 --> 08:19.367
Everything hurts.

08:24.467 --> 08:29.001
There isn't anything I do that isn't about you, somehow.

08:29.001 --> 08:31.034
Even opening the refrigerator,

08:31.034 --> 08:34.400
I start to ask if you want anything.

08:35.866 --> 08:39.034
And then last night

08:39.034 --> 08:41.400
There were dishes in the sink.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.866
And I thought, oh,

08:43.866 --> 08:46.734
why can't he just put these in the dishwasher.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.400
God, I love you, Melinda.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.567
I didn't mean to leave.

08:51.567 --> 08:55.200
I never want to be without you.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.168
If you could just get a sign.

08:59.168 --> 09:02.367
If I just knew that you were all right.

09:03.233 --> 09:05.600
If I knew that...

09:05.600 --> 09:07.650
you were at peace somehow,

09:07.650 --> 09:09.701
then maybe I could get through all this.

09:10.534 --> 09:13.400
I wish I could.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.101
But I'm here.

09:15.101 --> 09:17.634
I'm with you now.

09:26.367 --> 09:27.934
Come on inside.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.001
Time to get some sleep.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.001
I would if I could.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.001
I would if I could.

10:24.001 --> 10:26.434
You can't help!

10:30.934 --> 10:32.567
Jim...

10:32.567 --> 10:34.801
Is this you? I don't understand.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.300
Mel, no! It's not me!

10:36.300 --> 10:37.467
It's this ghost...

10:38.600 --> 10:41.101
Melinda, I'm right here. Hear me.

10:41.101 --> 10:43.001
Honey, is everything ok down there?

10:43.001 --> 10:46.867
Yeah. Everything's fine. Just go back to sleep.

10:46.867 --> 10:50.168
Mel, hear me. Hear me!

11:10.734 --> 11:12.567
Nice turnout.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.367
Sorry, I'm a little, uh...

11:39.367 --> 11:41.333
I...The thing is...

11:41.333 --> 11:44.567
I was going to stand here and talk about loss.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.233
About...

11:47.233 --> 11:50.801
losing a husband,

11:50.801 --> 11:54.300
a son,

11:54.300 --> 11:56.367
losing a friend.

11:56.367 --> 12:01.667
All of a sudden it feels wrong to talk about loss.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.200
All of a sudden I want to talk about what we gained.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.934
What he leaves us with.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.767
We're not people who've lost.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.534
We're winners.

12:12.534 --> 12:14.233
Winners because he was here.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.500
He was with us.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.667
He loved us.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.567
And we loved him.

12:24.901 --> 12:27.333
We're all better for knowing him...

12:27.333 --> 12:31.300
Each and every single person here.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.567
Where's the loss in that?

12:34.567 --> 12:37.534
Listen, um...

12:37.834 --> 12:43.234
I was gonna play this, you know, sad, moving song.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.967
Jim didn't like sad, moving songs.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.368
He liked to rock.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.401
And so should we.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.567
I'm here.

14:45.567 --> 14:48.500
I know.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.533
I just danced at my husband's funeral.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.900
Aren't I the merry widow.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.800
Another scandal in Grandview.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.201
I couldn't understand why you were staying away.

15:08.201 --> 15:10.567
Never. You just couldn't see me through your grief.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.067
It had to lift.

15:12.067 --> 15:14.867
I don't understand the signs you were giving me.

15:14.867 --> 15:17.201
The apple, the dishes, silverware.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.167
I was like, "what, is he hungry?"

15:19.167 --> 15:21.993
Is that the only message he has for me from the great beyond?

15:21.994 --> 15:23.500
It wasn't me.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.900
You've got another ghost...

15:24.900 --> 15:28.233
angry teenage girl, I think.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.400
She might be dangerous, Mel.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.700
None of that matters to me anymore.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.533
I am so empty without you.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.967
No, I'm here.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.700
And I'm not going anywhere.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.767
You can't stay.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.700
You know that. You have to cross over.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.734
Why?

15:45.734 --> 15:47.000
It's the way it is.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.366
It's what happens next.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.034
I don't want to.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.167
I know that.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.867
Mel, I never told you this.

15:53.867 --> 15:56.433
But I don't think I believe in the crossing over part.

15:56.433 --> 15:59.034
Not that it doesn't happen.

15:59.034 --> 16:01.900
But does it have to happen?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.833
If you don't believe it,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.667
that's like saying that you don't believe in me.

16:08.667 --> 16:12.333
No. Of course I do. I'm just asking you the question.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.734
Do you think maybe it's better sometimes

16:14.735 --> 16:15.599
that somebody stays?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.433
I know it feels that way.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.800
You think I want you to go?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.598
You think I wouldn't be happy just to stay here

16:23.599 --> 16:25.157
and forget about everything else?

16:25.266 --> 16:28.399
Look, it's not that I don't want you to have a life...

16:28.400 --> 16:32.034
This is my purpose. It's what I have this gift for.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.633
For souls to cross over and to take the next step.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.000
And it's what's best for you. So I can't...

16:38.767 --> 16:41.266
Hey, no more words.

16:42.633 --> 16:45.233
I just want to be with you now.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.667
- Here you go. - Thank you.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.034
I can stay, you know.

17:03.034 --> 17:05.233
I'm fine. Really.

17:06.834 --> 17:10.834
I know. Since the wake I feel so much lighter.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.967
It's almost like the ache is gone.

17:12.967 --> 17:15.666
It almost feels like there's something wrong with that.

17:15.666 --> 17:19.633
No, tell her it's what I would have wanted.

17:19.633 --> 17:21.266
You know Jim.

17:21.266 --> 17:25.800
This is what he would want... everyone to be happy.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.300
Yeah. I do believe that.

17:33.134 --> 17:35.333
You won't forget me, will you?

17:35.333 --> 17:37.633
I love you so much.

17:37.633 --> 17:38.967
I don't want to lose you, too.

17:38.967 --> 17:43.134
No. You won't. You're my family.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.000
Safe travels.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.134
Thank you, darling.

17:50.134 --> 17:51.333
Bye.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.201
Shouldn't we have told her that you're still here?

17:56.201 --> 17:57.500
No.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.834
If we had, she'd never be able to let go.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.101
Hey! Who are you?!

18:26.101 --> 18:27.767
What do you want with my wife?!

18:27.767 --> 18:28.867
What do you think you're doing?!

18:28.867 --> 18:30.333
I am right here!

18:30.333 --> 18:31.800
Can't you see me?!

18:33.300 --> 18:34.967
I hate you!

18:56.800 --> 18:59.734
I just want to make you a damn omelet.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.834
What?

19:06.834 --> 19:09.533
Do you remember what you said about your mom?

19:09.533 --> 19:11.167
That you didn't want her to know that you were here

19:11.167 --> 19:13.533
because she wouldn't be able to let go?

19:14.934 --> 19:16.767
You're the one who can't let go.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.700
And you have to.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.300
It's not fair for me to keep you here.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.834
You're not keeping me here, I'm keeping me here!

19:24.834 --> 19:28.967
Then it's not fair for me to make you stay.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.500
Melinda, why would we not be together if we can?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.700
Because we're not together. We can't be.

19:34.700 --> 19:35.800
Not in the real world.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.134
How about our world?

19:37.134 --> 19:40.300
Isn't this better than never seeing each other again?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.934
Total, naked truth...

19:49.400 --> 19:52.034
I'd be happy never leaving this house again,

19:52.034 --> 19:53.101
If I could be with you.

19:53.101 --> 19:54.467
Alive or dead.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.667
But you have a journey to take.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.700
So do I.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.266
We just can't be together right now, that's all.

20:07.734 --> 20:11.266
It's our...fork in the road.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.034
Until we meet again.

20:13.034 --> 20:15.467
Over on your side.

20:19.201 --> 20:21.300
My road.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.700
My journey is with you.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.333
It is you.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.433
It's always been that way.

20:28.433 --> 20:29.867
And that was the choice I made.

20:29.867 --> 20:32.533
And I'm not...

20:32.533 --> 20:35.867
I cannot let it go just because I'm dead.

20:38.034 --> 20:40.867
There's a sentence you don't hear yourself say every day.

20:43.834 --> 20:46.734
I don't want you to come here anymore.

20:49.167 --> 20:52.533
It just... it hurts us both.

20:52.533 --> 20:54.034
You know, and it's wrong.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.533
So if you love me, you'll just...

20:56.533 --> 20:59.633
You'll just do the right thing and cross over.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.201
You don't believe that.

21:01.201 --> 21:02.366
Yes, I do.

21:04.967 --> 21:07.366
Please...

21:07.366 --> 21:10.366
don't make this any harder than it already is.

21:13.500 --> 21:17.067
You know what you have to do.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.800
I'll be with you again.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.034
And it won't seem like such a long time,

21:31.034 --> 21:33.167
I promise.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.934
Oh, Jim.

21:56.934 --> 22:00.467
Please don't do this.

22:00.467 --> 22:02.667
Are you kidding me?

22:02.667 --> 22:05.767
I'm off duty, ok? I can't help you.

22:05.767 --> 22:09.167
You have to help him.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.533
Who? Jim?

22:13.533 --> 22:14.767
Forgive him.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.734
For what?

22:15.734 --> 22:16.800
Who are you talking about?

22:16.800 --> 22:19.067
Look what I've done to him.

23:15.034 --> 23:17.667
Can I just say that no matter what else,

23:17.667 --> 23:21.167
messing with people like this is the greatest?

23:21.167 --> 23:23.800
And can I just say my freaking heart rate

23:23.800 --> 23:26.700
Hasn't gone below 125 since I met you people?

23:26.700 --> 23:27.867
Why would you do that?!

23:27.867 --> 23:29.201
I'm sorry, Eli.

23:29.201 --> 23:31.667
I just wanted to see if I could turn on your clock radio.

23:31.667 --> 23:34.734
I mean, there's a big learning curve to this whole ghost thing.

23:34.734 --> 23:37.101
You know, lone ranger look is good on you.

23:37.101 --> 23:39.468
My eyes are sensitive to light, ok?

23:39.468 --> 23:41.834
Is the nuclear level really necessary? Seriously.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.900
Sorry. I can't do it.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.001
What are you doing here, Jim?

23:46.001 --> 23:47.500
Not that I'm not glad to hear you.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.301
But why aren't you with Melinda?

23:49.301 --> 23:51.034
Look. Melinda doesn't want to see me ok.

23:51.034 --> 23:52.734
She just wants me to cross over.

23:52.734 --> 23:54.434
Seriously?

23:54.434 --> 23:56.368
I thought you guys had the perfect marriage.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.201
You die. She throws you out? That's weird.

23:58.201 --> 24:00.867
Dr. Phil, I don't think I need any advice on my marriage, ok.

24:00.867 --> 24:02.900
I just...I need your help.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.867
How?

24:03.867 --> 24:05.900
There's a ghost haunting Melinda.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.967
It's a toxic ghost.

24:07.967 --> 24:09.934
And I'm afraid she's gonna hurt her.

24:09.934 --> 24:11.700
Well, with all due respect,

24:11.700 --> 24:15.167
I mean don't you think you're in a little bit better position

24:15.167 --> 24:17.167
than I am to deal with a ghost?

24:17.167 --> 24:19.600
I mean, me being alive, and you being...

24:19.600 --> 24:20.767
dead?

24:20.767 --> 24:22.900
I was going to say less alive.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.367
The ghost is afraid of me. I can't pin her down.

24:25.367 --> 24:28.034
Or I don't know, haven't learned how to do that yet.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.401
And I'm worried about Melinda.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.201
Because right now, she's more vulnerable than ever.

24:31.201 --> 24:32.633
What kind of ghost?

24:32.633 --> 24:33.734
Ok. A sick one.

24:33.734 --> 24:35.533
She's wears a hospital gown.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.667
She has discolored skin, her hair's falling out.

24:38.667 --> 24:40.533
I think she's a cancer patient.

24:40.533 --> 24:41.834
What do you want me to do?

24:41.834 --> 24:44.067
I want you to work with Melinda

24:44.067 --> 24:48.867
and find out who this ghost is and what she wants, ok?

24:48.867 --> 24:51.700
Eli, maybe you can help Melinda

24:51.700 --> 24:54.900
re-engage a little bit with real life, ok?

24:54.900 --> 24:56.434
Get her mind off me.

24:56.734 --> 24:58.733
In other words, get Melinda to do something

24:58.733 --> 24:59.633
she doesn't want to do.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.967
That's always easy.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.584
Just tell her I can't cross over...

25:03.584 --> 25:05.201
I won't cross over...

25:05.201 --> 25:07.401
until I know this ghost is out of her life.

25:07.401 --> 25:09.368
Ok?

25:09.368 --> 25:13.401
I don't want to complain, but I'm starting to tan.

25:13.401 --> 25:15.167
You could use it.

25:19.301 --> 25:20.900
Ok.

25:20.900 --> 25:23.800
50/50 shot that whole thing was a dream.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.101
That was no dream.

25:25.101 --> 25:26.700
What if I really want it to be?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.001
Why did he keep coming to you?

25:28.001 --> 25:30.368
Does he want you to talk me about having him stay?

25:30.368 --> 25:31.667
He's worried about you.

25:31.667 --> 25:33.633
He wants to make sure you're safe before he leaves.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.633
Safe? Nobody's safe.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.667
Look, I think his heart's in the right place.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.368
I know where Jim's heart is.

25:39.368 --> 25:42.434
All right? And I know he's doing this because he loves me.

25:42.434 --> 25:44.667
And I'm doing what I'm doing because I love him.

25:44.667 --> 25:47.834
It's like O. Henry meets Edgar Allan Poe.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.567
If you want to help Jim, just tell him to cross over.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.234
I want to help you.

25:52.234 --> 25:54.500
I am fine.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.734
No, you're not.

25:55.734 --> 25:57.967
You're angry. You're hurt. You're lost.

25:57.967 --> 25:59.834
Just like anybody would be who's going through this.

25:59.834 --> 26:01.667
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.034
Yes, there is.

26:03.034 --> 26:05.167
You can help me find this ghost who's haunting you.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.267
Find out what she wants.

26:07.267 --> 26:09.134
I don't care.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.734
Then fake it!

26:10.734 --> 26:12.034
You need to do something positive.

26:12.034 --> 26:13.900
Something to help this ghost, help Jim,

26:13.900 --> 26:15.767
and help you.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.600
Tell me what you know about her.

26:20.533 --> 26:22.834
She said I needed to forgive him.

26:22.834 --> 26:25.434
Jim? For what?

26:25.434 --> 26:27.633
I don't know if she was talking about Jim.

26:27.633 --> 26:30.067
She seems really confused.

26:30.067 --> 26:32.633
Jim says he thinks she might be a cancer patient.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.700
Yeah, could be.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.800
Ok. So we'll check some hospitals.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.917
Yeah, 'cause a cancer death in Driscoll county,

26:39.917 --> 26:42.034
that should be a snap.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.201
It's a start.

26:45.967 --> 26:48.301
Look, I know that you're trying to help.

26:48.301 --> 26:50.001
But I can't do this.

26:50.001 --> 26:53.600
I don't want anything to do with ghosts. Ok?

26:55.734 --> 26:58.434
Melinda...

26:58.434 --> 27:00.734
Jim, people have been searching for a way

27:00.734 --> 27:03.034
to live forever for a million years.

27:03.034 --> 27:05.867
But it just can't be. It's against nature.

27:05.867 --> 27:08.067
I'm not looking to live forever.

27:08.067 --> 27:10.368
I just can't live without Melinda.

27:10.368 --> 27:12.267
You're not.

27:12.267 --> 27:16.567
But you owe it to her to let her live without you.

27:18.533 --> 27:20.468
Jim, I can't wait any more.

27:20.468 --> 27:22.834
I'm crossing over.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.334
I want to bring you with me, little brother.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.134
That's what I've been waiting for.

27:26.134 --> 27:29.533
But I can't force you.

27:29.533 --> 27:34.533
What's it gonna be?

27:43.900 --> 27:45.800
Is that dad?

27:47.934 --> 27:50.267
He's been waiting, too.

27:50.267 --> 27:53.100
For both of us.

27:55.367 --> 27:56.634
I can't.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.201
He's not here?

29:02.568 --> 29:04.767
Who?

29:04.767 --> 29:07.100
The dead man.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.601
My husband.

29:10.167 --> 29:13.634
No. No, he's not here.

29:13.634 --> 29:16.668
He doesn't want me to talk to you.

29:16.668 --> 29:18.800
He hates me.

29:20.067 --> 29:21.534
Is this about Jim?

29:21.534 --> 29:25.334
First, it's about my step-dad.

29:25.334 --> 29:26.668
I hurt him.

29:26.668 --> 29:28.301
Hurt him how?

29:28.301 --> 29:29.967
Is he still alive?

29:29.967 --> 29:32.267
Yes.

29:32.267 --> 29:34.534
But he doesn't want to be.

29:37.367 --> 29:41.367
Look, I...I don't want to seem hard.

29:41.367 --> 29:43.867
But I'm a mess right now.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.668
It's all my fault.

29:45.668 --> 29:49.800
I know how it is to feel guilty. I do.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.334
Everything is my fault.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.434
It's because of what I did.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.934
What did you do?

30:02.934 --> 30:06.367
I'm the reason your husband is dead.

30:13.301 --> 30:15.634
What would this ghost have to do with Jim's death?

30:15.834 --> 30:17.191
Wouldn't Jim have said something?

30:17.201 --> 30:18.667
Unless he doesn't know.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.901
Or the ghost is confused or lying.

30:20.901 --> 30:22.667
Thanks for narrowing that down.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.201
See, that's why we need you back in the game!

30:25.201 --> 30:27.634
You gotta listen to what this ghost has to say...

30:27.634 --> 30:29.400
I think I scared her off last night.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.201
Heh. Isn't that irony?!

30:31.201 --> 30:33.167
I mean, most ghosts scare the hell out of the living,

30:33.167 --> 30:34.301
But you...

30:34.301 --> 30:36.567
Focus. How do we figure out who this ghost is?

30:36.567 --> 30:38.500
You want focus? How about this...

30:38.500 --> 30:39.833
We've been assuming,

30:39.833 --> 30:41.167
because of what you and Jim have said,

30:41.167 --> 30:44.500
that the ghost, by the way she looks, is a cancer patient.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.533
But there's another possibility.

30:46.533 --> 30:48.150
Jim said that the ghost had something

30:48.150 --> 30:49.767
in her bathrobe. An apple?

30:49.767 --> 30:51.901
Yeah. That she threw at my head.

30:51.901 --> 30:54.734
Why would there be an apple, or any food, in a bathrobe?

30:54.734 --> 30:56.368
Something she was saving?

30:56.368 --> 30:58.284
Or hiding. Hiding because she wanted

30:58.284 --> 31:00.201
someone to think she'd eaten it.

31:00.201 --> 31:01.533
I don't get it.

31:01.533 --> 31:04.834
Ok. Yellow skin, decaying teeth, hair loss

31:04.834 --> 31:07.634
Are all symptoms of...

31:07.634 --> 31:09.901
anorexia.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.334
My ghost isn't all that thin.

31:14.334 --> 31:16.867
There could be other complications from not eating.

31:16.867 --> 31:17.500
Like your heart stopping.

31:18.301 --> 31:20.967
That would make more sense given her age

31:20.967 --> 31:22.500
and all the guilt that she's feeling.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.268
And if she's local...

31:24.268 --> 31:25.551
makes it easier to track down

31:25.551 --> 31:26.834
'cause it's more unusual in Grandview.

31:26.834 --> 31:28.834
What did I just do?

31:28.834 --> 31:30.834
Come on, say it with me.

31:30.834 --> 31:33.400
Narrowed it down.

31:37.301 --> 31:38.500
I'm sorry, Mr. James.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
The hospital will never give out that information.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.268
Actually it's Dr. James.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.167
I don't see an "M.D." On there.

31:44.167 --> 31:46.767
Doctor of psychology and philosophy.And doctor of love

31:46.767 --> 31:49.901
in my last year of high school,if you must know.

31:49.901 --> 31:52.301
Very impressive. Bye-Bye.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.634
- Eli, listen... - Aah!

31:53.634 --> 31:55.600
Just get her to bring up the informational on her computer?

31:55.600 --> 31:57.600
- Are you ok? - Yeah, yeah.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.101
I just hate when something I'm not expecting happens.

32:01.101 --> 32:02.400
You just ask her to look at the records.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.634
She doesn't have to name names.

32:03.634 --> 32:05.867
I don't know how that's gonna help.

32:05.867 --> 32:07.334
How what's gonna help?

32:07.334 --> 32:10.834
Because I can read the name over her shoulder, genius.

32:11.934 --> 32:13.600
Can you do me a favor?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.600
Can you just look and see if someone specific...

32:15.600 --> 32:18.467
No, not specific! Eli, she can't do that.

32:18.467 --> 32:21.934
And when I say specific I mean anyone, really,

32:21.934 --> 32:25.301
In general, who may have died of anorexia in the last month?

32:25.301 --> 32:27.467
And why would I do that?

32:29.767 --> 32:31.734
Because you're doing research at the university

32:31.734 --> 32:33.901
on anorexia deaths in the student population.

32:33.901 --> 32:34.934
That's right.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.301
Eli, she can't hear me.

32:36.301 --> 32:39.500
And I'm doing research at the university

32:39.500 --> 32:41.167
on anorexia deaths.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.467
And I want to see if there's an upward curve

32:43.467 --> 32:45.767
in back-to-school months.

32:45.767 --> 32:48.800
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in one of your classes.

32:51.134 --> 32:53.901
There were 2 deaths last month.

32:53.901 --> 32:57.368
One in the hospital, one D.O.A.

32:57.368 --> 32:59.268
Does that help?

32:59.268 --> 33:00.334
Got it.

33:00.334 --> 33:02.201
It does help. It's very helpful.

33:02.201 --> 33:03.334
If it were up to me,

33:03.334 --> 33:05.001
you'd have a little something extra

33:05.001 --> 33:06.567
in your envelope this week.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.934
You should walk away now.

33:08.934 --> 33:12.334
Caitlin Mahoney. Her address 15 Keats Street.

33:12.334 --> 33:13.667
Don't forget that, ok?

33:13.667 --> 33:14.767
Got it.

33:14.767 --> 33:17.368
He's in defib.

33:17.368 --> 33:20.400
Defib charged to 200.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.634
Clear!

33:24.634 --> 33:27.101
Resume C.P.R. Give him an amp of epi.

33:29.001 --> 33:32.500
Ok. Hold C.P.R. Let's do a rhythm check.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.001
Still in asystoli.

33:34.001 --> 33:35.867
I'm gonna call it.

33:35.867 --> 33:38.001
Time of death 11:22.

33:40.034 --> 33:41.934
I'll call the wife.

33:41.934 --> 33:43.934
No more pain.

34:12.699 --> 34:14.433
It's hard, isn't it?

34:14.433 --> 34:15.433
What?

34:15.433 --> 34:16.867
Being you.

34:16.867 --> 34:18.766
I don't mean, like, right now.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.867
I mean, like, every day. Doing what you can do.

34:20.867 --> 34:22.634
I just tried it for, like, 5 minutes,

34:22.634 --> 34:24.067
I thought my head was going to explode.

34:24.067 --> 34:25.634
I used to think it was hard.

34:25.634 --> 34:28.333
But I didn't know what "hard" meant.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.533
That's the house.

34:33.533 --> 34:35.533
You know what? I'm really don't feel like doing this.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.067
Can you do it?

34:37.067 --> 34:39.417
Me?! I just did the whole hospital-get-a-name-thing.

34:39.417 --> 34:39.766
It's your turn.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.583
I understand. I just don't feel like

34:41.583 --> 34:43.400
I can face a grieving parent.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.567
What?

34:45.567 --> 34:47.201
Oh, No.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.368
Remember me?

35:04.134 --> 35:07.667
Jim, I know that I asked you to stay away.

35:07.767 --> 35:08.834
And you have.

35:08.834 --> 35:10.800
But there's really something I need for you to know.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.500
I'm here.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.400
It's ok.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.134
Caitlin Mahoney died a month ago from anorexia.

35:18.134 --> 35:20.567
She lived with her stepfather.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.800
Her heart gave out before he even had the chance

35:22.800 --> 35:24.234
to realize she'd stopped eating.

35:24.234 --> 35:27.533
He was devastated. She was all that he had.

35:27.533 --> 35:30.666
Anyway, her step-father went back to work right away,

35:30.666 --> 35:32.400
sooner than he should have.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.268
Because he didn't know what else to do.

35:33.268 --> 35:35.067
And then something happened at work.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.733
Something that almost destroyed him.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.467
What?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.400
Where did he work?

35:43.400 --> 35:46.134
The Grandview police department.

35:50.134 --> 35:53.134
Her step-father is Carl Neely,

35:53.134 --> 35:55.301
The detective who shot you.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.401
Look, I already told you I'm sorry.

36:00.601 --> 36:02.100
I don't blame you for hating me.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.567
I just don't want to talk about any of this anymore, all right?

36:04.767 --> 36:06.901
I feel bad enough as it is.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.034
I don't hate you.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.333
No one hates you.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.634
I told you that I would bring someone who could help.

36:13.834 --> 36:15.067
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

36:15.267 --> 36:16.534
I've been to the department shrinks.

36:16.534 --> 36:18.367
I just want to be left alone.

36:18.367 --> 36:19.967
It wasn't your fault, you know.

36:19.967 --> 36:21.234
I shouldn't have been on the job.

36:21.234 --> 36:23.401
I shouldn't have trusted myself pulling my weapon.

36:24.401 --> 36:25.733
I wasn't ready.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.867
I mean Caitlin.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.867
What happened to her. It wasn't your fault.

36:32.401 --> 36:34.534
How'd you know about Caitlin?

36:34.534 --> 36:37.234
She blames herself for what happened.

36:37.234 --> 36:38.767
She wishes she could take it back.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.367
But none of us can.

36:40.367 --> 36:43.234
None of us can change the things that happen or what we do.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.234
We just have to accept it. Deal with it.

36:45.234 --> 36:48.101
And try not to let it kill us.

36:48.101 --> 36:49.934
She's been here.

36:49.934 --> 36:51.600
Watching over you.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.767
What are you telling to me?

36:55.267 --> 36:59.568
What I'm saying is she's seeing what's happening to you.

36:59.568 --> 37:01.334
And it's breaking her heart.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.267
That can't be.

37:03.267 --> 37:04.834
It can't be.

37:04.834 --> 37:07.000
It is.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.201
Tell him I that I didn't meant to hurt him.

37:10.201 --> 37:15.468
That I was just so stupid, so obsessed.

37:15.468 --> 37:18.568
I just couldn't get thin enough.

37:18.568 --> 37:21.468
She's so sorry.

37:21.468 --> 37:23.934
She never thought about what it would do to you.

37:23.934 --> 37:25.733
I should have seen she was in trouble.

37:25.733 --> 37:28.501
I should have helped her.

37:28.501 --> 37:31.900
I didn't want to believe that something was wrong with her.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.900
I hid it from him.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.967
I thought everybody would love me more if I was thin.

37:36.967 --> 37:41.267
Thin and beautiful, like in the magazines.

37:42.534 --> 37:44.800
She thinks what happened that night...

37:44.800 --> 37:47.434
with you and Jim... was her fault.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.934
Because you were so distracted.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.834
No. No. Not her fault.

37:51.834 --> 37:57.334
I shouldn't have been on duty. She has to know that.

37:57.334 --> 38:01.067
I just wanted her back.

38:01.067 --> 38:03.301
I wanted my girl back.

38:08.167 --> 38:11.167
He was the one person who never judged me.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.534
I totally took him for granted.

38:14.534 --> 38:18.501
She knows that you were always there for her.

38:18.501 --> 38:21.800
Even if she didn't realize it.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.000
Even when she thought you couldn't see her.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.667
But why? Why would she do that to herself?

38:33.667 --> 38:37.034
Maybe she was scared.

38:37.034 --> 38:40.568
So scared that her whole life

38:40.568 --> 38:42.834
She would never be truly loved.

38:42.834 --> 38:44.634
Not completely.

38:44.634 --> 38:46.434
Not for really who she really was.

38:48.900 --> 38:53.934
Maybe now she sees that she was loved in that way.

38:53.934 --> 38:57.334
And that it was real.

38:57.334 --> 39:02.334
And once you've had that kind of love, it never goes away.

39:03.468 --> 39:05.633
It just gets stronger.

39:08.134 --> 39:11.468
And it means that she can move on.

39:11.468 --> 39:14.267
And so can you.

39:16.733 --> 39:19.134
I'm sorry I hurt you, daddy.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.301
I love you.

39:28.101 --> 39:31.267
Caity, I always thought you were perfect inside and out.

39:32.967 --> 39:35.667
I wish you could've seen that.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.501
Me, too.

39:39.501 --> 39:43.101
Melinda, tell him.

39:47.468 --> 39:50.600
Jim's here, too.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.301
He doesn't blame you.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.800
She's crossing over now.

40:13.334 --> 40:14.767
You coming?

40:21.101 --> 40:23.034
Not quite yet.

40:44.601 --> 40:47.968
It wasn't your fault either.

40:47.968 --> 40:48.968
What?

40:48.968 --> 40:50.567
What happened to me.

40:50.567 --> 40:53.300
It wasn't because of what you can do.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.601
Then why?

40:55.601 --> 40:58.801
I don't know. I don't think we can know.

40:58.801 --> 41:00.367
Not yet. Not here.

41:00.367 --> 41:02.467
Then I don't want to know anything.

41:02.467 --> 41:05.167
It would just be much easier.

41:06.068 --> 41:08.068
Melinda, I love you.

41:08.068 --> 41:09.334
I love you, too.

41:12.068 --> 41:14.300
Now you have to go and do the right thing.

41:22.534 --> 41:24.200
I know.

41:27.001 --> 41:28.600
Jim?

41:32.600 --> 41:34.600
You ok? Keep it going.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.667
No.

41:50.401 --> 41:53.434
Charging.

41:53.434 --> 41:55.534
Ok. Clear back.

41:55.534 --> 41:57.967
Clear.

41:59.367 --> 42:01.134
Charging.

42:01.134 --> 42:03.434
Clear.

42:03.434 --> 42:05.601
Still non-responsive.

42:05.601 --> 42:09.000
That's it. We lost him.

42:09.001 --> 42:12.701
Let's call it. Time of death...

42:21.634 --> 42:23.667
Let's get him ready for transport.

42:25.667 --> 42:27.201
Jim, no!

42:30.201 --> 42:31.634
No!

42:32.801 --> 42:34.502
No!

42:35.868 --> 42:37.701
Hey, Patrick, get over here!

42:45.301 --> 42:49.534
Hang on there, buddy. Just take it easy. Give us a second.

42:49.534 --> 42:52.168
Jim, it's you. You're back.

42:52.168 --> 42:55.968
Hold on a second. Take it easy.

42:57.468 --> 42:59.135
Jim...

43:01.068 --> 43:02.667
Do I know you?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
