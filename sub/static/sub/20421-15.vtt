WEBVTT

00:05.190 --> 00:07.610
The second group of instructors is here.

00:07.950 --> 00:10.670
The summer training camp is going well.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.580
I'm so happy!

01:57.840 --> 02:03.600
<b>Attack</b>

02:00.270 --> 02:01.370
Attack.

02:04.410 --> 02:08.980
Everyone, why don't we wait until 
this afternoon to enter the dungeon?

02:09.450 --> 02:13.430
Miss Minori, why do you think we're here?

02:13.830 --> 02:16.480
Getting as much experience as 
possible and raising our levels

02:16.480 --> 02:18.860
in the dungeon is our most important task.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.120
But for the past two days, we didn't 
even last three hours before escaping.

02:24.530 --> 02:26.700
That's true, but...

02:26.700 --> 02:31.870
So couldn't we get just as far 
if we go in the afternoon?

02:31.870 --> 02:33.670
We can't keep doing the same thing forever.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.670
And that's the problem!

02:36.960 --> 02:38.370
Minori-chan...

02:38.370 --> 02:40.330
So what do we do this morning?

02:40.330 --> 02:42.680
Let's just relax a bit.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.560
Miss Minori,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.770
are you joking?

02:46.770 --> 02:49.230
Come on, Rudy, calm down.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.860
Minori isn't the type to joke around.

02:53.270 --> 02:56.110
"Relax a bit" might be going too far,

02:56.110 --> 02:58.490
but I think we should introduce ourselves.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.570
We already did that.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.550
We all know each other now.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.260
No, we don't.

03:04.260 --> 03:05.200
What?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.720
We don't. It's true.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.250
I don't know anything about any of you.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.840
What you like, what you don't like...

03:15.410 --> 03:19.300
I don't know if you want to 
stand at the front or stay back.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.250
And since I don't know, I can't 
help you, even if I want to.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.220
Please tell me.

03:27.590 --> 03:33.480
I'm weak, so unless I hear everything 
and remember it, I can't help you.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.230
Everything?

03:35.530 --> 03:37.030
I mean everything.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.740
Like, for example...

03:38.740 --> 03:42.520
What's that fire magic you use, Rundel Haus?

03:43.880 --> 03:46.100
That's <i>Orb of Lava</i>,

03:46.100 --> 03:49.780
a ball of molten magma.

03:49.780 --> 03:53.500
But that doesn't tell me anything!

03:53.920 --> 03:57.890
For example, why do you use it?

03:58.320 --> 04:01.470
You have a lot of attack spells. 
Why that one?

04:01.820 --> 04:03.100
Why?

04:03.680 --> 04:06.050
Because it's effective.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.920
Why is it effective?

04:09.720 --> 04:14.440
It's one of the most powerful spells I have.

04:15.030 --> 04:18.950
And it has a fast casting time. 
It only takes two seconds.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.350
And its cool down is eighteen seconds.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.990
It doesn't take long before you can use it again.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.140
That means I can cast it 
once every twenty seconds,

04:28.140 --> 04:30.540
so I can use it many times in a single battle.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.020
Hang on a second.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.290
My class is samurai, and our taunts...

04:37.290 --> 04:38.680
Taunts?

04:39.710 --> 04:41.510
Taunts provoke the enemy.

04:43.280 --> 04:48.060
<i>Thunder Slash</i> is one of the samurai 
skills with the longest range,

04:48.060 --> 04:50.250
but it won't reach more than about three meters.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.190
Another attack,

04:52.190 --> 04:54.480
<i>Samurai's Challenge</i>, is close-range 
and has an even shorter range.

04:55.130 --> 04:57.480
And? What are you getting at?

04:58.130 --> 05:00.820
Those techniques are taunts,

05:00.820 --> 05:03.910
so they don't actually damage the enemy,

05:04.380 --> 05:07.840
but the enemy will think they've 
taken a ton of damage.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.300
I see.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.040
So you use them to draw enemy attention.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.170
Yes.

05:12.590 --> 05:15.680
The samurai has a high defense, so my job is

05:15.680 --> 05:18.920
to keep the enemy focused on 
me rather than all of you.

05:19.930 --> 05:22.700
<i>Samurai's Challenge</i> takes two seconds to land.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.380
Just like <i>Orb of Lava</i>.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.880
But its range is no farther than 
the reach of my katana.

05:29.350 --> 05:30.180
I get it.

05:30.730 --> 05:34.680
If we both attack the second we're in range...

05:35.050 --> 05:36.010
Yes.

05:36.010 --> 05:38.870
<i>Orb of Lava</i> will hit first.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.100
My attempt to taunt them will be wasted.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.330
That's why all the enemies go after you.

05:45.330 --> 05:48.090
Then, should I not use <i>Orb of Lava</i>?

05:48.090 --> 05:49.830
Just wait two seconds.

05:50.220 --> 05:53.700
In a glorious, elegant battle, 
a loss of two seconds can prove fatal.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.460
So then...

05:56.960 --> 06:00.610
Is that where <i>Coward's Fugue</i> can be useful?

06:01.070 --> 06:01.960
What's that?

06:02.220 --> 06:04.620
Sounds cowardly, judging by the name.

06:05.010 --> 06:07.090
Is that a skill of yours, Miss Isuzu?

06:07.090 --> 06:10.550
<i>Coward's Fugue</i> is a skill I just learned.

06:10.550 --> 06:13.100
It's a continuous support song.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.420
Continuous?

06:14.420 --> 06:17.480
Basically, I can leave it running.

06:18.710 --> 06:23.180
It seems to make the damage 
dealt by any non-warrior class

06:23.180 --> 06:26.240
appear to be lower as long as it's in effect.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.730
You have a skill like that?

06:27.730 --> 06:28.530
Really?

06:28.530 --> 06:31.660
I d-do... Really.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.400
But it isn't that amazing.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.560
I mean, doesn't it sound kind of useless?

06:36.560 --> 06:40.420
It doesn't deal damage or heal...

06:40.690 --> 06:41.620
No.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.230
Depending how you use it...

06:44.860 --> 06:46.300
I'm glad to have heard that.

06:47.290 --> 06:51.230
It seems I need to apologize, Miss Minori.

06:51.610 --> 06:55.430
I admit my ignorance and 
lack of understanding.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.870
No, I had no idea, either.

06:58.870 --> 07:03.190
So tell me all the spells you know, Rundel Haus.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.820
What do you like and dislike about them?

07:05.820 --> 07:08.440
When do use you them? 
When would you like to use them?

07:08.870 --> 07:12.450
All of them? That'd take some time, Miss Minori.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.860
We have plenty of time.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.010
Yeah.

07:16.010 --> 07:16.810
Right.

07:16.810 --> 07:17.950
Let's hear them!

07:18.270 --> 07:22.960
Okay, we'll start with the spells I know.

07:31.190 --> 07:32.890
The patrol's approaching.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.390
Five, I think...

07:36.170 --> 07:38.020
They'll be here in about ten measures.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.520
Um, ten measures is... about twenty seconds?

07:47.070 --> 07:48.650
Let's go with what we agreed on.

07:51.690 --> 07:53.780
<i>It'll be fine. I can do this.</i>

07:54.340 --> 07:58.540
<i>Yesterday, we spent all day talking, 
instead of going into the dungeon.</i>

07:59.080 --> 08:01.790
<i>Now I know all their skills...</i>

08:01.790 --> 08:03.540
<i>And how they best work together.</i>

08:04.220 --> 08:06.990
<i>Even I spent a lot of my valuable time</i>

08:06.990 --> 08:09.440
<i>listening to what they had to say.</i>

08:09.440 --> 08:11.050
<i>This has to work!</i>

08:11.520 --> 08:14.610
<i>All that's left is to combine those techniques.</i>

08:15.450 --> 08:20.740
Formation, operator, field monitor, patrol file...

08:21.400 --> 08:25.920
Memorize the basics of party 
combat I just explained.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.480
I have it in my head...

08:27.840 --> 08:30.690
But what, exactly, am I supposed to do with it?

08:31.070 --> 08:32.670
Well, basically...

08:32.670 --> 08:33.330
They're here!

08:35.490 --> 08:36.610
<i>Lightning Slash!</i>

08:38.060 --> 08:41.500
The first thing you should 
consider is our formation.

08:41.780 --> 08:45.380
The basic idea is that our front 
line fighter, our samurai,

08:45.380 --> 08:47.400
will draw the enemy's attacks.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.130
But for that to work, we'll need everyone's help.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.630
Take care of them!

08:58.290 --> 08:59.250
Get back.

09:01.820 --> 09:06.770
I have more appropriate spells than 
<i>Orb of Lava</i> for dealing with you alone.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.530
Taste the sorcerer's elegant magics...

09:10.530 --> 09:12.690
<i>Lightning Chamber!</i>

09:14.270 --> 09:15.100
Okay!

09:17.250 --> 09:18.320
Why, you...

09:18.120 --> 09:19.530
<b>Tohya 
Race/ Human 
Samurai, Lv. 30 
Log Horizon</b>

09:19.530 --> 09:22.040
His HP is at 64%.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.650
Healing!

09:24.110 --> 09:27.540
The next role to keep in mind is the operator.

09:27.990 --> 09:30.900
It's their job to monitor everyone's status,

09:30.900 --> 09:35.290
but it's a waste for both Serara 
and me to heal at the same time,

09:34.840 --> 09:37.930
<b>Tohya 
Race/ Human 
Samurai, Lv. 30 
Log Horizon</b>

09:35.290 --> 09:37.950
so most of the time, I'll leave it to Serara.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.780
Thank you, Serara!

09:42.500 --> 09:45.060
<i>It's starting to hurt, but...</i>

09:45.660 --> 09:49.520
The job of a front-line tank is 
to absorb all the enemy hits,

09:49.520 --> 09:51.450
and to trust his companions.

09:51.450 --> 09:52.440
Tohya,

09:53.090 --> 09:55.320
as a man, you must promise to do that!

09:56.460 --> 09:58.820
I know that, Master Naotsugu.

09:59.570 --> 10:02.120
Now, come and get me!

10:02.120 --> 10:03.620
<i>Samurai's Challenge!</i>

10:07.200 --> 10:08.580
Minori, keep an eye out.

10:08.580 --> 10:11.810
Isuzu and Rudy, get ready to attack!

10:12.090 --> 10:12.960
Right!

10:12.960 --> 10:13.840
Yeah.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.420
I'll be the field monitor.

10:17.420 --> 10:18.870
My job is to monitor the area

10:18.870 --> 10:21.750
and tell you if reinforcements 
or enemy patrols are coming.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.870
That lets the attackers concentrate on fighting.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.410
Checking the corridor!

10:26.410 --> 10:28.600
No enemy patrols in sight!

10:29.070 --> 10:30.120
All clear.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.270
Get them!

10:31.660 --> 10:33.780
Are they all good and mad now?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.970
Yeah... I had time

10:35.970 --> 10:38.460
to use <i>Samurai's Challenge</i> twice on each.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.780
They won't get to you easily now, Rudy!

10:41.240 --> 10:43.540
That's a load off my mind, then.

10:44.650 --> 10:46.460
<i>Resonance Beat!</i>

10:50.200 --> 10:52.540
<i>Orb of Lava!</i>

10:53.160 --> 10:57.670
Return to the darkness from whence you came!

11:00.280 --> 11:01.300
Wow.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.640
<i>Frigid Wind!</i>

11:14.790 --> 11:17.530
Patrol file! Secure the immediate area!

11:18.570 --> 11:23.530
Patrol file is a way to maintain your 
formation and field monitoring.

11:23.530 --> 11:27.870
The first and last members in 
line cover each other's view,

11:27.870 --> 11:32.540
so attackers and healers can focus on 
their own jobs as the party moves.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.040
Did we win?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.800
No one else is coming.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.680
This battle is over!

11:40.680 --> 11:42.590
Yahoo!

11:42.590 --> 11:44.520
We did it!

11:45.250 --> 11:47.050
This is how it should be.

11:47.050 --> 11:49.360
Just let yourself be happy, Rudy.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.940
<i>I understand, Shiroe.</i>

11:54.660 --> 11:58.380
<i>We just need to talk to one another 
and work things out.</i>

11:58.380 --> 12:01.700
<i>It's so simple, but it's more 
important than anything,</i>

12:02.470 --> 12:06.330
<i>in order to make members of 
a party become true friends.</i>

12:13.170 --> 12:14.460
Thanks so much!

12:14.850 --> 12:17.210
It's so hard to write on this world's paper.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.400
Take as much as you need.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.050
Part of a scribe's job is making paper and ink.

12:23.050 --> 12:25.470
I still need to work on the ink, though.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.920
Oh, the stuff you gave me last 
time was more than sufficient.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.590
Just being able to write with it isn't enough.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.470
When this was a game,

12:35.470 --> 12:39.250
didn't you do any quests where maps 
or documents were important?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.990
Come to think of it...

12:41.510 --> 12:44.010
A single document can be a magic item.

12:44.510 --> 12:47.200
And of course, making high-level 
documents requires

12:47.200 --> 12:51.460
high-level paper and ink as ingredients.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.320
So that's why...

12:54.320 --> 12:57.500
You're copying this map to raise your level, then?

12:58.880 --> 13:01.010
Actually, I need it for something.

13:01.770 --> 13:06.510
Maps written on papyrus and bark 
simply don't last long enough.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.760
You seem tired.

13:09.340 --> 13:13.040
I guess making this really is a lot of work...

13:13.040 --> 13:15.100
No, that isn't why...

13:15.450 --> 13:18.920
I mean, maybe I'm tired from that dance.

13:18.920 --> 13:24.030
Ah, then shall we practice, so that 
it'll be easier for you next time?

13:24.030 --> 13:25.530
No, I'd rather not.

13:26.290 --> 13:28.640
Any time you want to, just let me know.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.630
Thank you for these.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.750
I look tired, huh?

13:38.260 --> 13:39.540
Maybe she's right.

13:39.970 --> 13:42.050
I'm thinking too much about the wrong things.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.550
<i>Every time we die in this world, 
we lose our memories.</i>

13:56.290 --> 14:00.260
<i>Is it possible that we'll forget the real world?</i>

14:02.520 --> 14:05.220
<i>There's so much we don't know about this world.</i>

14:06.170 --> 14:09.170
<i>We don't even know what 
we should do from here on...</i>

14:12.290 --> 14:14.080
Good evening, Shiroe!

14:14.380 --> 14:15.270
Hey, there.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.190
I guess things are going well with the dungeon.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.110
You can tell?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.840
I can... By the tone of your voice.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.140
Yeah.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.000
I'll give you the report.

14:27.730 --> 14:31.120
This morning, we entered the dungeon at 7:30.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.230
After around seven hours of exploration,

14:33.230 --> 14:34.350
we left at 15:00.

14:34.780 --> 14:38.320
We went as far as the end of the right fork,

14:38.320 --> 14:40.860
and defeated the Burning Dead at the blast furnace.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.840
That's amazing!

14:42.840 --> 14:47.030
The Burning Dead encounter is about the 
same as your party's average level.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.100
It's one thing to do that in the game,

14:49.100 --> 14:51.990
but right now, even for a 
veteran party, it's a tough feat.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.200
Yeah!

14:53.550 --> 14:54.590
What about everyone else?

14:55.390 --> 14:57.000
They're all in the tent.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.500
That isn't what I mean.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.200
How did everyone else do?

15:03.600 --> 15:04.560
Um...

15:04.560 --> 15:07.260
Tohya went to the front and drew 
all the enemy attention.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.120
That matches what you wrote down...

15:10.120 --> 15:13.580
But this time, we decided to plot out 
the fight locations from the start,

15:13.580 --> 15:19.270
move to safe rooms, and split the 
enemy into smaller groups.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.130
Pulling.

15:21.130 --> 15:21.770
Yes.

15:22.530 --> 15:26.240
We focused on monsters 
with ranged attacks first,

15:26.240 --> 15:30.530
and I acted as off-healer, 
while watching the surrounding area.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.850
We concentrated our attacks on one enemy 
at a time to wear down their ranks.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.390
Um, am I making sense?

15:37.390 --> 15:39.250
It's fine. I understand.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.290
<i>I can see them in my head...</i>

15:42.160 --> 15:46.500
<i>Following the fundamentals I taught them, 
and using teamwork down to the fine details.</i>

15:47.240 --> 15:48.920
<i>It seems like an obvious thing,</i>

15:48.920 --> 15:53.470
<i>but who knows how many little things 
they had to figure out to reach that point?</i>

15:54.460 --> 15:56.680
Shiroe? Can you hear me?

15:56.680 --> 15:59.150
Yeah, I can hear you perfectly.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.300
Did everyone else do their jobs?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.560
Of course!

16:02.910 --> 16:05.660
Serara's healing spells are amazing.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.830
She has a huge variety of them.

16:08.490 --> 16:12.140
But I guess Isuzu has the widest skill repertoire.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.010
Almost too many for me to remember...

16:14.920 --> 16:17.130
Shiroe? Are you laughing?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.250
I'm sorry, I'm not.

16:19.620 --> 16:20.680
Honest.

16:21.350 --> 16:25.000
Everyone's started calling Rundel Haus "Rudy."

16:25.290 --> 16:28.080
He's an amazing sorcerer and really handsome,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.750
but he's kind of stupid, and a bit lame.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.510
Handsome, stupid, and lame?

16:35.550 --> 16:38.770
But he's fun to be around! 
He's a sorcerer, and...

16:39.040 --> 16:41.140
Wait, I already said that.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.890
Anyway, his magic is really powerful.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.030
<i>It's true that there's a lot we 
don't know about this world.</i>

16:54.450 --> 16:57.450
<i>But that's why I must go forward.</i>

16:58.030 --> 16:59.600
<i>And be cheerful like she is.</i>

17:00.280 --> 17:02.990
<i>And do what I can, one thing at a time.</i>

17:12.120 --> 17:14.590
It's really quite a bother.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.220
A bother?

17:17.110 --> 17:19.510
An invitation from a gentleman requires

17:19.510 --> 17:22.310
a certain degree of attention 
to etiquette and appearance.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.060
Even on a peaceful afternoon like this.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.350
I'd thought you'd want this.

17:28.900 --> 17:33.130
I assumed you'd prefer this to an invitation 
from someone more stiff and formal.

17:33.690 --> 17:34.920
Was I wrong?

17:36.070 --> 17:37.820
I see I was right.

17:38.430 --> 17:41.150
May I invite you again tomorrow?

17:41.810 --> 17:42.960
As you like.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.770
Do as you like.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.670
I feel so much better...

17:53.670 --> 17:57.070
One step in a dungeon, and your 
appearance is all ruined.

17:57.070 --> 17:59.350
Yeah, they're so full of soot.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.760
But today went really well, too, huh?

18:02.760 --> 18:07.600
Yeah, I was worried when two 
Burning Dead appeared...

18:08.020 --> 18:11.900
You and Rudy worked really well together.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.900
Should that make me happy?

18:15.900 --> 18:18.370
What kind of vague answer is that?

18:18.620 --> 18:22.590
Didn't you say Rudy seems kind of like a prince?

18:22.590 --> 18:24.870
But don't you think so?

18:25.260 --> 18:26.620
Just his looks, that is.

18:27.050 --> 18:31.990
If you ran into him somewhere, he might 
look cute enough to make you nervous...

18:31.990 --> 18:33.180
But...

18:33.180 --> 18:34.640
You don't get nervous?

18:34.640 --> 18:36.630
Nope, not at all.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.040
I wonder why.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.600
Stop that. It wasn't that great.

18:50.010 --> 18:51.840
No, it was wonderful.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.110
It was like the sound suffused the air.

18:55.620 --> 18:56.680
Thank you.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.660
I wonder if everyone's getting ready to sleep.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.840
We're getting up early tomorrow...

19:02.350 --> 19:05.040
Tomorrow morning's our last dungeon run.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.840
That's right...

19:06.840 --> 19:08.180
The last one already.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.780
It's been fun, huh?

19:10.170 --> 19:11.180
Yeah.

19:11.180 --> 19:13.290
The food was a little lacking, though...

19:13.290 --> 19:14.500
You think so?

19:14.500 --> 19:17.050
I thought it was good... BBQ and stuff.

19:17.350 --> 19:19.120
What do you normally eat?

19:19.120 --> 19:22.290
Hot sandwiches... Or hot sandwiches...

19:22.700 --> 19:23.890
Sometimes hot sandwiches.

19:23.890 --> 19:26.530
That's nothing but hot sandwiches!

19:26.530 --> 19:30.170
Do you mean hot pollock roe 
sandwiches from Ray Parker?

19:30.850 --> 19:32.350
How did you know?!

19:32.350 --> 19:33.900
You like those, too, Miss Isuzu?

19:34.050 --> 19:35.290
I love them!

19:35.290 --> 19:37.320
The way they pop in your mouth...

19:37.600 --> 19:40.450
I know! Just remembering it...

19:43.820 --> 19:45.330
<i>I g-get it!</i>

19:45.860 --> 19:46.850
<i>He's like a dog.</i>

19:46.850 --> 19:49.330
<i>He's like a golden retriever!</i>

19:49.790 --> 19:51.830
What's wrong, Miss Isuzu?

19:52.140 --> 19:53.930
N-Nothing...

19:54.340 --> 19:55.560
<i>I see.</i>

19:55.560 --> 19:57.190
<i>That's why he doesn't make me nervous.</i>

19:57.190 --> 19:59.840
<i>Even if he's handsome, he's a dog.</i>

20:00.680 --> 20:02.100
Are you crying?

20:02.100 --> 20:06.390
Are you sad you won't see me as much anymore?

20:06.390 --> 20:08.490
Well, m-maybe...

20:08.490 --> 20:09.900
Maybe that's why.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.550
If you were in a guild, I could 
see you any time I wanted.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.460
A guild, huh?

20:14.460 --> 20:17.990
I'm sorry, but it would be a crime

20:17.990 --> 20:21.760
to tie my talents to one place.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.850
<i>How can he wink so naturally like that?</i>

20:26.850 --> 20:28.370
<i>Rudy's amazing.</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:30.120
<i>But he's a dog.</i>

20:30.460 --> 20:32.370
Even if I'm not in a guild,

20:32.370 --> 20:35.130
many places would want a sorcerer of my talent.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.880
Even after the camp ends, you'll surely 
hear rumors of me in Akihabara...

20:41.330 --> 20:43.890
And when you do, feel free to contact 
me whenever you like.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.730
That's true.

20:45.730 --> 20:49.220
Then I'll add you to my Friend List.

20:51.380 --> 20:54.230
Let's go for hot pollock roe sandwiches sometime.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.040
Adding you now...

20:57.110 --> 20:58.230
Huh?

21:02.950 --> 21:04.150
Why?

21:10.510 --> 21:11.750
Sahuagin?

21:11.940 --> 21:13.960
The fish monsters?

21:13.960 --> 21:16.550
Marie said they appeared on the coast.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.260
Sahuagin should be, at most, level 20 to 30.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.450
Even the new kids should be okay with them.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.790
What the hell?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.740
I've never seen so many...

21:54.360 --> 21:55.580
Get out of here!

21:55.580 --> 21:57.430
Run to the forest!

22:04.870 --> 22:05.930
Marie!

22:08.050 --> 22:09.200
Shouryuu...

22:09.200 --> 22:10.100
Get back.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.220
We have to call back the groups 
camping in the forest!

22:17.200 --> 22:18.210
Yes, but...

22:18.210 --> 22:20.680
I'm the Crescent Moon Alliance's combat leader!

22:20.680 --> 22:22.040
Do what I tell you!

22:22.390 --> 22:23.540
All right.

22:25.770 --> 22:26.920
<i>Why?</i>

22:26.920 --> 22:28.990
<i>Why did this huge army appear from nowhere?</i>

24:05.860 --> 24:08.220
A sudden assault by demi-humans.

24:08.220 --> 24:10.300
Huge armies of goblins and sahuagin.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.820
Even so, the People of the Land's nobles

24:12.820 --> 24:16.600
and the Round Table cannot put aside 
their differences to work together.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.840
And Tohya, Minori, and the other 
young players take action.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.100
Next time: Return of the Goblin King.

24:21.900 --> 24:29.990
<b>Return of the Goblin King</b>

24:24.570 --> 24:27.000
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
