00:21.360 --> 00:22.760
What was that?

00:22.760 --> 00:24.160

You what, dear?

00:53.840 --> 00:56.520
Uh... Sarah's zip has broken.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.280
We wondered if you might be
able to fix it.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.120
Hmm.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.720
Nope, can't fix that.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.920
It snapped.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.400
Oh, it's a goner.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.160
Oh, no.

Ah-ha!

Yep, it's dreadful.
SHE SIGHS

01:40.920 --> 01:44.720
I don't suppose you have anything
a bit more like the original?

01:44.720 --> 01:47.520
Oh, no, dear. I'm afraid not.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.840
But you're right.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.720
Ugh! That won't do.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.920
What we need is the haberdasher.

All around you, sunshine.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.520
Excuse me, dear.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.280

Large red button.

Hello.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.720

03:28.920 --> 03:30.880
uh... Bit.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.480
Oh, no, dear!

03:32.480 --> 03:34.440
It's called a zip pull.

Hmm. We must be in the stock room.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.680
And seems the haberdasher took your
request a bit literally.

04:15.680 --> 04:19.880
Eh? As in you got exactly what
you asked for.
