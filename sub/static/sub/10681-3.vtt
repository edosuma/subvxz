<i>Walt: I was watching
"Taxi Driver" last night.</i>

00:10.224 --> 00:11.821
- Such a good movie.
- Oh, yeah.

00:11.894 --> 00:13.292
I don't do a lot of impressions,

00:13.294 --> 00:15.028
but De Niro, I think I-I could pull off.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.763
Okay, let's hear it.

00:16.765 --> 00:18.597
[imitating Travis Bickle]:
Are you talkin' to me?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.600
You talkin' to me?

00:20.602 --> 00:22.102
Are you talkin' to me?

00:22.103 --> 00:24.638
[all laughing]

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
Your voice progressively got higher

00:26.641 --> 00:29.042
until you sounded like Steve Urkel.

00:29.044 --> 00:31.577
[all laughing]

00:31.579 --> 00:33.246
Let me hear your De Niro.

00:33.247 --> 00:34.715
[imitating Travis
Bickle]: You talkin' to me?

00:34.716 --> 00:36.283
You must be talkin' to me.

00:36.284 --> 00:40.417
There's nobody else here.

00:40.418 --> 00:42.118
'Cause I'm impressed.

00:42.121 --> 00:44.454
Yeah, he definitely had a
little bit more menacing,

00:44.457 --> 00:46.723
creepy vibe to him.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.259
[all laugh]

00:48.261 --> 00:49.726
- How about Mike?
- All right, how about this?

00:49.728 --> 00:51.060
[imitating Travis
Bickle]: You talkin' to me?

00:51.063 --> 00:52.429
I don't see nobody else here.

00:52.430 --> 00:53.463
You talkin' to me?

00:53.466 --> 00:55.332
Talkin' to me, wise guy?

00:55.334 --> 00:57.433
That's awesome! I had chills.

00:57.435 --> 01:00.237
Come on, De Niro doesn't
play it like he's Italian.

01:00.238 --> 01:02.906
He plays it very flat affect. He's like...

01:02.908 --> 01:04.007
[imitating TravisBickle]:
You talkin' to me?

01:04.010 --> 01:06.010
You talkin' to me?

01:06.012 --> 01:08.245
I don't see nobody else around here."

01:08.246 --> 01:10.647
- More flat.
- That was real flat.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.283
- Yeah.
- Well, at least I'm not like...

01:12.284 --> 01:13.450
[high-pitched voice] You talkin' to me?

01:13.451 --> 01:14.852
Are you talkin' to me?

01:14.853 --> 01:17.487
- Who are you talkin' to?

Kevin: Hello, and welcome to
another episode of "Comic Book Men,"

01:54.615 --> 01:56.481
the only show that's smart enough

01:56.484 --> 01:58.551
to keep Scooby Doo away from Groot.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.951
[laughing]

01:59.954 --> 02:01.319
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.721
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.323
- Ming Chen.
- Okay.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.525
What, pray tell, did the
Stash unearth this week?

02:06.528 --> 02:08.060
Something came in the other day

02:08.062 --> 02:09.360
that wasn't comic book related,

02:09.364 --> 02:10.729
but comic strip related.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.264
Mm.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.973
How you doin'?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.207
Hey, what's happening?

02:22.210 --> 02:24.210
I have some, uh, Hungerford figures.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.312
I was looking to see if you
guys might be interested in 'em.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.747
Hungerford?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.681
Yeah, they were the first figures

02:29.683 --> 02:30.983
actually of, uh, the "Peanuts" characters.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.084
That one is Linus,

02:32.086 --> 02:35.754
Charlie Brown, and Lucy.

02:35.757 --> 02:37.757
Oh, my God. I've never seen these before.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.231
It's actually the original version of them

02:46.234 --> 02:48.567
and the first toys that
actually ever came out.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.868
From, what is it, 1950, 1940 something...?

02:49.871 --> 02:51.069
1958.

02:51.072 --> 02:53.072
- You a big "Peanuts" fan?
- Yeah.

02:53.074 --> 02:55.206
- Who's your favorite peanut?
- It would have to be Linus.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.609
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.210
He's missing something, isn't he?

02:58.211 --> 02:59.711
That's... that's why he's my favorite.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.580
I actually still have my baby blanket

03:01.582 --> 03:02.782
from when I was a kid, so...

03:02.783 --> 03:04.683
Wait a minute.

03:04.686 --> 03:07.186
You still carry it around?
I mean, well, you still...

03:07.187 --> 03:08.587
- I still own it.
- You still own it.

03:08.590 --> 03:09.854
But you don't actually use it, right?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.524
Uh, you know, here and there.

03:11.526 --> 03:12.625
Who knows?

03:12.627 --> 03:14.860
Wow. Did you guys have a blanket?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.396
Blanket, no. I did have a
Snoopy, though, like, a plush,

03:17.397 --> 03:18.864
- and I still have him.
- Oh, cool.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.566
And I used to carry him around by the neck.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.967
So his neck is about that skinny now.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.969
Hearing your stories about your father,

03:23.972 --> 03:25.638
I thought he would've thrown
it into an incinerator.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.406
Well, no, I learned it from him.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.375
He used to carry me around
by my neck like that.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.143
- [all laughing]
- I mean, I think it's pretty

03:31.145 --> 03:33.445
painfully obvious that, like, you know,

03:33.448 --> 03:36.115
Bry is the Charlie Brown of the Stash.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.651
[all laughing]

03:38.652 --> 03:40.652
You are Charlie Brown, my friend.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.054
Better hair.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.456
Yes, you're making out better than

03:43.457 --> 03:45.424
Charlie Brown that way,
but everything else,

03:45.425 --> 03:47.593
it's a big zigzag across your chest.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.260
[all laughing]

03:49.263 --> 03:51.730
I like to see myself as
Snoopy. I'll be honest with you.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.966
Maybe that's a little showy, but so am I.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.602
- Walt?
- I... I'm at a loss.

03:56.603 --> 03:57.670
Pigpen.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.971
[all laugh]

03:58.973 --> 04:00.740
He's a Lucy.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.242
Totally! Oh, my God, he's absolutely right.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.911
Lucy was about pulling the football away

04:05.913 --> 04:08.480
from Charlie Brown.

04:08.483 --> 04:09.848
You're a little bit younger than us.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.350
I don't know if you could really understand

04:12.353 --> 04:14.919
how important the "Peanuts" strip was.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.322
I mean, it wasn't a holiday

04:17.324 --> 04:19.759
unless there was a
"Peanuts" animated special.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.093
If you missed the Thanksgiving one,

04:21.095 --> 04:22.862
it didn't feel like Thanksgiving.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.596
Even though you knew
exactly what was gonna happen

04:24.598 --> 04:26.031
'cause you'd seen it the year before.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.632
[all laughing]

04:27.634 --> 04:30.002
Did you guys feel sad

04:30.004 --> 04:31.870
reading the strips or
watching the cartoons?

04:31.872 --> 04:34.105
'Cause they were so brutal
to poor Charlie Brown.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.507
Yeah, like, in this day and age,

04:35.509 --> 04:37.276
with bullying and stuff,
it would not be allowed.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.978
They bullied him. They
definitely bullied him.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.548
It seemed like the poor kid never won.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.149
You know, if Snoopy wasn't in there

04:44.151 --> 04:46.018
giving up some levity,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.952
you really would want to
just go into the bathroom

04:47.954 --> 04:49.387
and blow your head off

04:49.389 --> 04:51.057
after watching those "Peanuts" episodes.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.620
[all laughing]

04:53.470 --> 04:57.290
For as much as we have affection for
"Peanuts," was it geared for kids?

04:57.293 --> 04:59.387
Because when you look back
at it now, you're like,

04:59.387 --> 05:02.396
"There's some real underlying
themes going on here."

05:02.398 --> 05:04.064
It's about a boy with depression,

05:04.067 --> 05:06.569
whose friends don't make it any better.

05:07.428 --> 05:08.685
And it wasn't just Charlie Brown

05:08.685 --> 05:10.619
who was flawed or broken.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.555
It was like... Linus, OCD.

05:13.557 --> 05:16.057
Yes, and Lucy who has
a personality disorder

05:16.059 --> 05:17.459
that makes her hyper-aggressive.

05:17.461 --> 05:19.528
- The dirty one.
- Pigpen.

05:19.529 --> 05:21.228
Hygiene issues.

05:21.230 --> 05:24.899
Snoopy, uh, was the most normal,
well-adjusted of them all.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.201
- [all laughing]
- Didn't he also have delusions

05:27.204 --> 05:29.904
that he was a World War
I flying ace, though?

05:29.906 --> 05:32.007
So I don't know how
normal that dog really was.

05:32.009 --> 05:33.641
[all laughing]

05:33.644 --> 05:36.177
All right, so you're looking
to sell all three of them?

05:36.178 --> 05:37.312
- Yep.
- Okay.

05:37.314 --> 05:38.579
I'm definitely interested.

05:38.581 --> 05:40.382
What are you looking to get for 'em?

05:40.384 --> 05:41.682
$135.

05:41.685 --> 05:43.084
- $135?
- Mm-hmm.

05:43.086 --> 05:45.252
See, I don't know much about them, though.

05:45.254 --> 05:47.488
I don't know what they really
go for in today's market.

05:47.490 --> 05:48.824
I have seen these go for,

05:48.826 --> 05:51.192
I think, about $125 for the three.

05:51.194 --> 05:52.827
And that's retail.

05:52.829 --> 05:55.197
- So we got to make money.
- Right, right.

05:55.199 --> 05:57.331
I mean, what about, like, $110?

05:57.334 --> 05:59.033
60 bucks?

05:59.036 --> 06:00.601
[exhales sharply] Wow.

06:00.603 --> 06:02.704
[exhales deeply] How about $100?

06:02.706 --> 06:04.406
They'll sell fast.

06:04.408 --> 06:06.341
I mean, they're "Peanuts."

06:06.343 --> 06:08.375
Yeah, they're all the rage these days.

06:08.377 --> 06:09.577
[all laugh]

06:09.579 --> 06:10.911
I mean, I think

06:10.913 --> 06:14.348
every day you lose a "Peanut" fan.

06:14.350 --> 06:15.884
$75 is the best I can do.

06:18.019 --> 06:20.137
Well...

06:21.004 --> 06:22.089
Let's do it.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.891
All right, got a deal.

06:25.026 --> 06:26.394
$60, $75.

06:26.396 --> 06:27.696
- Thanks, man.
- All right, thanks.

06:27.697 --> 06:29.798
- Have a good day, guys.
- Take it easy.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.199
I'm gonna tell you guys

06:31.201 --> 06:34.134
about stuff that happened to me this week.

06:34.137 --> 06:36.271
- Mr. Shatner...
- Bill, Bill.

06:36.273 --> 06:39.139
I got something here that I
guarantee you won't see again.

06:39.141 --> 06:42.110
Oh, the most horrifying of the Megos.

06:44.562 --> 06:46.968
We're gonna do something
different right now.

06:47.244 --> 06:48.944
I'm gonna tell you guys a story

06:48.946 --> 06:52.346
about stuff that happened to me this week.

06:52.348 --> 06:53.749
There's some figures that loom

06:53.750 --> 06:56.418
so large in the genre world, man,

06:56.420 --> 06:59.187
if there was a Mount Rushmore of geeks,

06:59.189 --> 07:01.423
their face would be on it, okay?

07:01.425 --> 07:03.190
I got a phone call, and they were like,

07:03.192 --> 07:04.992
"William Shatner would like to talk to you

07:04.995 --> 07:07.762
about his comic book
project on 'Comic Book Men.'"

07:07.764 --> 07:09.463
You got to talk to Captain Kirk?

07:09.466 --> 07:10.464
Yes, yes.

07:10.466 --> 07:12.466
It was a rare opportunity,

07:12.468 --> 07:16.137
and when a legend knocks,
you answer the door, man.

07:25.048 --> 07:26.314
Mr. Shatner, I've...

07:26.315 --> 07:28.115
- Bill, Bill.
- Bill.

07:28.117 --> 07:30.651
So, Bill, we're gonna
talk about "Man O' War,"

07:30.653 --> 07:32.821
the cinematic graphic novel.

07:32.822 --> 07:34.889
But before we dive into
that, I just want to give you

07:34.891 --> 07:36.358
a little propers.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.659
Aside from the body of
work that everybody knows,

07:38.661 --> 07:40.528
this is what I've always dug about you.

07:40.531 --> 07:42.064
You're a renaissance man.

07:42.066 --> 07:43.531
You acted.

07:43.533 --> 07:44.733
You've won Emmy's and stuff,

07:44.735 --> 07:46.300
but you've always jumped outside,

07:46.302 --> 07:47.668
whether it's writing or just...

07:47.670 --> 07:49.471
Like, I look back at your history,

07:49.473 --> 07:50.872
and there's never a period

07:50.874 --> 07:53.240
- where you weren't busy.
- Yes.

07:53.242 --> 07:54.875
You're a guy who's never
content to just be like,

07:54.877 --> 07:56.377
"All right, I'm done."
Like, you've never...

07:56.379 --> 07:57.745
When do you sit back? When do you rest?

07:57.747 --> 07:59.413
Well, I mean, what are you gonna do?

07:59.415 --> 08:02.350
I mean, you know, you
can't sit like the Sphinx.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.086
The Sphinx has got to get up, right.

08:04.088 --> 08:06.088
- Well, I've tried.
- Right. Right.

08:06.089 --> 08:09.057
So I'm busy in all those things
that I'm passionate about.

08:09.059 --> 08:12.726
I compete on horses. I ride competitively.

08:12.728 --> 08:14.228
Really?

08:14.230 --> 08:16.064
I'm traveling and directing documentaries.

08:16.065 --> 08:18.867
I love to make documentaries.
The discovery...

08:18.869 --> 08:20.502
Like you and I are
discovering each other now...

08:20.504 --> 08:23.939
That discovery is like an act of creation.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.439
Yeah.

08:25.442 --> 08:27.509
And when am I gonna say, "Stop," you know?

08:27.511 --> 08:29.944
What I'm gonna say is,
"My fingers don't bend

08:29.947 --> 08:32.114
as much as they used to."

08:32.115 --> 08:34.582
- What accounts for, uh...
- I don't know.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.384
Besides talent?

08:36.385 --> 08:38.586
'Cause talent definitely
outs, and that'll take you far.

08:38.587 --> 08:41.123
Well, it takes you a certain way,

08:41.125 --> 08:42.724
but luck is huge.

08:42.725 --> 08:44.058
But time and time again,

08:44.061 --> 08:45.759
people just come to you and be like,

08:45.761 --> 08:46.894
"Let's go on a journey."

08:46.897 --> 08:48.730
And like the character you played,

08:48.731 --> 08:49.865
you've gone on journeys.

08:49.866 --> 08:51.133
I just came back

08:51.134 --> 08:53.201
from doing 2,400 miles on a motorcycle.

08:53.202 --> 08:55.437
- [laughs]
- I went from Chicago

08:55.438 --> 08:58.038
to Los Angeles on a bike
that I helped design.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.407
It's called "Rivet."

08:59.408 --> 09:00.908
R-I-V-E-T.

09:00.910 --> 09:02.610
American Wrench was the name of the company

09:02.613 --> 09:06.914
that I "partnershipped" with
in making this unique design.

09:06.917 --> 09:10.485
The bike, which was beautifully
designed, didn't work.

09:10.486 --> 09:12.419
- Really?
- Yeah, some stuff went wrong.

09:12.422 --> 09:14.155
So we...

09:14.158 --> 09:17.125
We present it to 150 people in the media.

09:17.126 --> 09:19.561
[imitates fanfare] Here we are.

09:19.562 --> 09:21.163
And I get on, and I can't go.

09:21.164 --> 09:23.664
The engine, which is a
500-horsepower engine,

09:23.667 --> 09:25.634
revs up, but it won't move.

09:25.635 --> 09:28.102
This is a Kobayashi Maru. What do you do?

09:28.105 --> 09:29.504
We rent a bike.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.907
My wife gets on the back, and off we go.

09:31.908 --> 09:34.109
We truck the Rivet to each city.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.744
We tell everybody, "Look at this.

09:35.745 --> 09:36.845
We're working on it."

09:36.846 --> 09:38.413
And we make the eight days.

09:38.414 --> 09:40.014
Dude, you don't believe
in the no-win scenario.

09:40.017 --> 09:41.482
Well, that's exactly it.

09:41.485 --> 09:43.018
[both laughing]

09:43.019 --> 09:45.320
Now, you've gone on to meet a lot of people

09:45.322 --> 09:47.154
in your career as a filmmaker,

09:47.157 --> 09:49.423
but could seven-year-old
Kevin Smith

09:49.426 --> 09:52.360
ever imagine meeting Captain Kirk?

09:52.361 --> 09:54.129
No, seven-year-old
Kevin Smith

09:54.130 --> 09:55.864
would've been like "I
don't like Captain Kirk.

09:55.865 --> 09:57.097
This show is boring."

09:57.100 --> 09:58.365
[all laughing]

09:58.368 --> 10:00.000
Until I got older

10:00.003 --> 10:01.769
and would come to appreciate
what "Star Trek" was...

10:01.772 --> 10:03.538
Just the performance levels

10:03.539 --> 10:05.706
of all those actors on "Star Trek."

10:05.708 --> 10:08.176
It's insanely well written,
insanely well acted.

10:08.177 --> 10:10.946
How intimidating was it
to be in the same room

10:10.947 --> 10:12.614
<i>with the Captain... the Captain?</i>

10:12.615 --> 10:15.383
I'll be honest with you,
man, like, number one,

10:15.384 --> 10:17.152
he's... he's iconic, not just from Kirk,

10:17.153 --> 10:18.519
but ever since I've been alive,

10:18.522 --> 10:21.822
William Shatner has been William Shatner.

10:21.825 --> 10:23.291
You know, "The Shat."

10:23.293 --> 10:24.960
Does he like to be
referred to as "The Shat"?

10:24.961 --> 10:27.895
No, not at all. I learned
that pretty quickly.

10:27.898 --> 10:28.897
[all laughing]

10:28.899 --> 10:30.164
Now, I don't think

10:30.167 --> 10:32.000
I've ever seen one on a card, though.

10:32.001 --> 10:33.400
This is perhaps the
only one you'll ever see.

10:33.403 --> 10:34.869
I've had people looking for 20 years

10:34.870 --> 10:37.216
- and never even seen one.
- Wow.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.553
The cinematic graphic novel,
which is a new concept.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.822
It's a comic book, it's an animated film,

10:42.825 --> 10:43.823
but it's neither.

10:43.826 --> 10:44.924
It's phenomenal.

10:46.232 --> 10:49.376
"Star Trek: Wrath of Khan" one
of my favorite movies of all time.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.148
The funeral for Spock,

10:51.149 --> 10:53.549
where Captain Kirk gives the eulogy,

10:53.552 --> 10:55.152
is one of my favorite

10:55.153 --> 10:57.386
performance moments in anything...

10:57.389 --> 11:00.289
Movies, TV, theater,
anything I've made myself.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.991
It is perfect,

11:01.994 --> 11:04.394
because you're talking
about two military men

11:04.395 --> 11:06.663
who've spent years together, you know,

11:06.664 --> 11:08.498
on a 5-year mission
through space and more.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.033
And his friend has died, and
we're never gonna see him again

11:11.035 --> 11:13.537
until "Star Trek III:
The Search for Spock."

11:13.538 --> 11:15.705
But in this moment, Kirk
is performing the ceremony,

11:15.706 --> 11:17.240
and he's very serious about it.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.208
This is where William Shatner crushes it.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.311
One of the greatest
acting moments in history.

11:21.312 --> 11:23.679
He says, "Of my friend,
I can say only this.

11:23.682 --> 11:27.250
"Of all the souls I've
encountered in my travels,

11:27.251 --> 11:29.086
his was the most"...

11:29.087 --> 11:33.190
And he cracks, and he can't
get through the sentence.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.225
And then he chokes it
back and goes, "Human."

11:35.226 --> 11:38.195
It is one of the most moving
moments in cinema history.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.495
When I die,

11:39.498 --> 11:41.764
I want William Shatner doing my eulogy.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.768
[all laughing]

11:55.048 --> 11:57.767
<i>What could you offer Batman
to become the new Robin?</i>

11:57.767 --> 11:59.500
Like, "Take me on as
your new Robin, Batman,

11:59.501 --> 12:01.335
- because I can..."
- [sighs]

12:01.336 --> 12:03.903
Do you have any detective skills?

12:03.905 --> 12:06.105
Like, can I, like, sniff out criminals...

12:06.107 --> 12:07.740
- Yeah.
- And solve crime?

12:07.743 --> 12:09.842
Well, I... It can't be that hard, right?

12:09.845 --> 12:11.745
- I mean...
- He'll train you.

12:11.746 --> 12:13.413
He'll train me. There's
on-the-job training, right?

12:13.416 --> 12:15.282
- Yes.
- [all laughing]

12:15.283 --> 12:16.783
Bryan: You think he'd make a good Robin?

12:16.786 --> 12:18.351
Well, which Robin are we talking about?

12:18.354 --> 12:20.788
We talking about the Robin
with the shortest of shorts?

12:20.789 --> 12:23.123
I'd be constantly, like,
pulling that yellow cape

12:23.125 --> 12:26.025
in front of me trying to
cover my, uh... my stuff.

12:26.028 --> 12:29.529
- Your camel toe?
- [all laughing]

12:29.532 --> 12:31.365
What about you?

12:31.366 --> 12:33.900
I mean, it'd be hard to call you
the Boy Wonder with the beard.

12:33.903 --> 12:37.804
Without the beard, it
would be very difficult.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.472
An out-of-shape,
middle-aged Robin?

12:39.475 --> 12:40.807
Yeah, seriously.

12:40.809 --> 12:43.409
Two staircases and I'm like,

12:43.412 --> 12:45.111
"Batman, I told you about the anemia.

12:45.114 --> 12:47.081
"I told you about the artificial knee.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.249
"You knew when we started this.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.484
Come on, man."

12:50.485 --> 12:53.419
[all laughing]

12:59.727 --> 13:01.495
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, guys.

13:01.496 --> 13:03.330
I got something here that I guarantee

13:03.331 --> 13:04.597
you won't see again.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.799
Oh!

13:06.802 --> 13:08.501
A MEGO Kresge Wolfman.

13:08.504 --> 13:11.270
The most horrifying of the Megos.

13:19.279 --> 13:20.346
Do you guys remember it?

13:20.349 --> 13:22.149
I know Mike... you remember this.

13:22.150 --> 13:24.017
Now, I don't think I've ever
seen one in a card, though.

13:24.019 --> 13:27.520
That's known as the Kresge packaging,

13:27.523 --> 13:29.490
which was a store that no longer exists,

13:29.491 --> 13:31.258
which eventually became K-Mart.

13:31.259 --> 13:33.360
I remember Kresge's. It
was like the Five & Dime.

13:33.361 --> 13:36.096
Exactly, and this wasn't in the window box

13:36.097 --> 13:37.764
like other Megos at the time.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.665
Only a couple have survived.

13:39.668 --> 13:40.868
I've had people looking for 20 years

13:40.870 --> 13:43.302
- and never even seen one.
- Wow.

13:43.304 --> 13:44.937
That's one of the rarest
figures you'll ever see.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.373
I'm sorry to disagree, but this is

13:46.375 --> 13:48.341
one of the rarest figures you'll ever see.

13:48.344 --> 13:50.210
[all laughing]

13:50.211 --> 13:52.479
There was a special packaging

13:52.480 --> 13:53.880
unique to Kresge's...

13:53.883 --> 13:57.518
Definitely the forefather
of the exclusive toy.

13:57.519 --> 13:59.986
My grandmother referred
to K-Mart as Kresge's

13:59.989 --> 14:01.822
till the day she died,

14:01.823 --> 14:03.890
always, 'cause that's what she knew.

14:03.893 --> 14:04.892
Close your eyes.

14:04.894 --> 14:06.360
Y-you can't see the counter,

14:06.361 --> 14:08.361
those stools that you'd sit in and spin on.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.364
A grilled cheese sandwich...

14:10.365 --> 14:11.664
- Yes.
- And maybe your mom...

14:11.667 --> 14:13.332
would buy you a toy on the way out.

14:13.335 --> 14:14.967
Yes, and you would beg your mom,

14:14.970 --> 14:16.702
"Can I get grilled cheese here?"

14:16.705 --> 14:18.504
She'd be like, "Here? No.

14:18.506 --> 14:21.475
- We have grilled cheese at home."
- [all laughing]

14:21.476 --> 14:23.342
I don't want to brag or, you know...

14:23.345 --> 14:25.011
But I had all the MEGO Monsters.

14:25.014 --> 14:26.379
This is one of the rare packages

14:26.381 --> 14:27.648
that they're actually calling

14:27.649 --> 14:29.216
the monsters themselves superheroes.

14:29.217 --> 14:30.650
That had a real impact

14:30.653 --> 14:33.187
on the way I perceived monsters.

14:33.188 --> 14:34.520
I was like, "A monster can be a good guy."

14:34.523 --> 14:37.191
And it really, um,
changed my whole outlook.

14:37.192 --> 14:39.058
I never was scared of a monster after that.

14:39.061 --> 14:40.661
Now I'm not so naive.

14:40.663 --> 14:43.330
At that point, I was like,
"Monsters can be superheroes."

14:43.331 --> 14:45.032
So the past 40 years have paid off.

14:45.033 --> 14:46.667
[all laughing]

14:46.668 --> 14:49.036
They had a castle play set,
if I remember correctly.

14:49.038 --> 14:50.437
I didn't have the castle.

14:50.438 --> 14:53.039
I would make my own castle
out of, like, pillows.

14:53.042 --> 14:56.243
I was a kid that didn't want
to go outside with my "dolls."

14:56.245 --> 14:57.610
- Right.
- Because my...

14:57.613 --> 15:00.013
I was waiting outside.

15:00.014 --> 15:01.748
[all laughing]

15:01.750 --> 15:03.616
I always had a hard time
convincing my mom to, like,

15:03.619 --> 15:05.018
you know, "Buy me the castle."

15:05.019 --> 15:06.452
She's like, "You got the monsters.

15:06.455 --> 15:07.620
Build your own castle."

15:07.623 --> 15:09.355
- Get creative.
- [all laughing]

15:09.357 --> 15:12.458
I've already spent on this
Cr... Get out of here, Walter!

15:12.461 --> 15:14.961
I would take, uh, the couch cushions,

15:14.964 --> 15:17.264
and I would build my own
castle, and I would build...

15:17.265 --> 15:19.099
I mean, it covered the entire living room.

15:19.100 --> 15:22.068
I could spend literally
days inside my castle,

15:22.071 --> 15:23.269
you know, only coming out

15:23.272 --> 15:24.871
to, you know, maybe use the bathroom.

15:24.874 --> 15:26.874
- Maybe.
- [all laughing]

15:26.875 --> 15:28.642
The castle smelled a little ripe.

15:28.644 --> 15:31.077
- Hey, King Walt, flush!
- [all continue laughing]

15:31.080 --> 15:34.081
Well, I definitely...
Definitely interested.

15:34.082 --> 15:35.215
- Great.
- Um...

15:35.216 --> 15:36.450
what are you looking to get for it?

15:36.451 --> 15:37.918
I'm looking for, uh, $1,500.

15:37.919 --> 15:38.951
15 bones.

15:38.953 --> 15:40.486
Wow.

15:41.956 --> 15:44.224
And there's no wiggle room?

15:44.225 --> 15:45.792
Or is there room for you to wiggle today?

15:45.793 --> 15:47.427
I would consider a slight wiggle.

15:48.830 --> 15:52.331
Would a slight wiggle be $750?

15:52.334 --> 15:55.302
That would be a very large wiggle.

15:55.303 --> 15:57.671
- More of a shimmy.
- Right. I'm thinking...

15:57.673 --> 16:00.640
- That's a full-on Lindy Hop.
- Right, exactly.

16:00.643 --> 16:03.309
The condition is a little off.

16:03.312 --> 16:05.177
Since you are such a fan yourself,

16:05.179 --> 16:07.346
what if you meet me in the middle

16:07.349 --> 16:09.682
and we go $1,100?

16:09.684 --> 16:12.485
This is perhaps the
only one you'll ever see.

16:12.488 --> 16:14.488
You could love it for 20 years as well.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.255
He's gonna have to,

16:16.258 --> 16:17.691
'cause his wife's gonna
kick him the hell out.

16:17.692 --> 16:19.293
You're gonna be sleeping
in that pillow fort.

16:19.294 --> 16:21.495
[all laughing]

16:21.496 --> 16:22.962
- I won't be alone.
- [laughs]

16:22.965 --> 16:24.331
- I'll... I'll take it.
- All right.

16:24.332 --> 16:26.365
- I'll do it right now.
- Great.

16:26.368 --> 16:28.201
- $1,100.
- Awesome.

16:28.202 --> 16:29.970
- Take it easy, guys.
- All right, have a great day.

16:29.971 --> 16:31.772
- Thanks again, man.
- See you later.

16:31.774 --> 16:33.139
Let me ask you this thing, though.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.142
Are there ever any days where you're like,

16:35.144 --> 16:37.510
"It'd be awesome to go
play Captain Kirk today"?

16:39.265 --> 16:41.678
Whether you like "Star Trek"
or not, you have to agree,

16:42.115 --> 16:44.782
William Shatner... one of
the most memorable actors

16:44.783 --> 16:46.049
of the last 50 years.

16:46.052 --> 16:47.551
Yeah, definitely. You're right.

16:47.552 --> 16:49.620
You remember a William Shatner performance.

16:49.621 --> 16:51.822
You remember, "Khan!"

16:51.823 --> 16:53.423
We all know him, of course,

16:53.426 --> 16:55.058
as Captain Kirk, first and foremost,

16:55.061 --> 16:57.894
but William Shatner has
been writing books for years.

16:57.897 --> 16:59.764
Sometimes they turn
those books into comics.

16:59.765 --> 17:01.765
- Remember "TekWar"?
- Oh, yeah.

17:01.768 --> 17:03.167
They did it as a comic book miniseries.

17:03.168 --> 17:04.800
And it was in a... In a prestige format,

17:04.804 --> 17:06.804
- very expensive book.
- Yeah.

17:06.806 --> 17:09.440
Mr. Shatner wrote another
book, "Man O' War".

17:09.442 --> 17:12.509
That's what they're adapting
into this thing they call

17:12.511 --> 17:14.345
the cinematic graphic novel.

17:16.847 --> 17:18.949
You write "Man O' War,"
mid to the late '90s.

17:18.951 --> 17:20.317
And now it comes back

17:20.318 --> 17:23.153
in the form of the cinematic graphic novel.

17:23.155 --> 17:25.855
The opportunity came along to
make a comic book out of it.

17:25.857 --> 17:27.790
It's a new entity.

17:27.794 --> 17:30.760
It's a comic book, it's an animated film,

17:30.762 --> 17:31.862
but it's neither.

17:31.864 --> 17:33.663
It's somewhere in between.

17:33.665 --> 17:35.532
And it's a reading experience as well,

17:35.535 --> 17:37.768
which is what the comic book is all about.

17:37.769 --> 17:39.936
I want to read my own interpretation

17:39.939 --> 17:41.337
of "put down that gun, you fool." I want...

17:41.339 --> 17:43.507
That's true, and when we watched it,

17:43.509 --> 17:45.175
there's motion, there's movement,

17:45.177 --> 17:47.344
but it is still reading a comic book,

17:47.346 --> 17:49.480
because there's the thought
balloons, the word balloons,

17:49.481 --> 17:50.713
- I'm reading.
- Exactly.

17:50.715 --> 17:52.148
I'm the performer just like I was

17:52.151 --> 17:53.851
when I used to read
comics that didn't move.

17:53.853 --> 17:57.020
Exactly. You know, I was
a kid, five, six years old

17:57.022 --> 17:58.556
under the covers with a flashlight

17:58.557 --> 18:00.490
reading these comic books

18:00.492 --> 18:03.160
and imagining Batman and Superman

18:03.162 --> 18:05.395
and going to bed

18:05.397 --> 18:07.131
with, uh, these legendary figures.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.898
You know, there are a bunch of
people out there right now...

18:08.901 --> 18:11.067
I was gonna say "kids,"
but let's be honest,

18:11.069 --> 18:12.702
they're all my age... who are just like,

18:12.704 --> 18:13.837
"I did that too."

18:13.839 --> 18:16.140
It's a wonderful stimulus.

18:16.142 --> 18:18.875
What a way to have your imagination piqued

18:18.877 --> 18:21.679
by the beauty of the comic book.

18:21.681 --> 18:23.213
It's magical.

18:23.215 --> 18:25.215
Have you gone to Comic-Con
almost every year?

18:25.218 --> 18:26.817
I've always had something to introduce.

18:26.818 --> 18:28.152
Right.

18:28.153 --> 18:30.386
Uh, this Comic-Con I did three panels.

18:30.388 --> 18:32.522
When you started the
job, that didn't exist.

18:32.525 --> 18:35.159
Like, you didn't go into
"Star Trek," going like,

18:35.161 --> 18:38.194
"Well, there'll be conventions.
There'll be, like..."

18:38.197 --> 18:39.529
There was no such thing.

18:39.531 --> 18:42.766
What was it like to watch it grow?

18:42.768 --> 18:44.535
Like, to watch fandom...

18:44.537 --> 18:47.104
It's phenomenal. It's... it's phenomenal.

18:47.105 --> 18:48.538
I mean, a couple of months

18:48.540 --> 18:52.175
will be the 50th
anniversary of "Star Trek."

18:52.177 --> 18:53.544
Right.

18:53.546 --> 18:57.213
50 years ago, I started playing it.

18:57.215 --> 18:58.615
There was a movie that I handed

18:58.617 --> 19:00.416
the reins over to Patrick Stewart, and...

19:00.419 --> 19:01.951
Mm-hmm. "Generations."

19:01.953 --> 19:03.753
"Generations," exactly.

19:03.756 --> 19:08.259
And I remember thinking,
"Oh, I have a pang.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.560
Uh, and it's not from
sitting on the horse."

19:10.563 --> 19:13.763
Right. [both laugh]

19:13.766 --> 19:15.465
Let me ask you this thing, though.

19:15.468 --> 19:17.768
Are there ever any days where
you get up and you're like,

19:17.769 --> 19:19.936
"It'd be awesome to go
play Captain Kirk today"?

19:19.939 --> 19:21.872
No.

19:21.874 --> 19:23.440
No? Done? [laughs]

19:23.442 --> 19:24.575
Really?

19:24.576 --> 19:25.808
[both laughing]

19:25.810 --> 19:28.144
Favorite William Shatner performance,

19:28.146 --> 19:30.213
but Kirk is pulled off the table.

19:30.215 --> 19:31.582
Mike?

19:31.584 --> 19:34.317
- Denny Crane.
- From "Boston Legal"?

19:34.319 --> 19:36.252
"Boston Legal," yeah he
and, uh, James Spader.

19:36.255 --> 19:37.654
When Kirk met Ultron.

19:37.656 --> 19:39.823
- Yes.
- What about you, Ming?

19:39.825 --> 19:41.724
Well, does it have to
be an acting performance?

19:41.727 --> 19:43.993
I thought his singing
performance was, uh...

19:43.996 --> 19:45.628
- It was admirable.
- Excellent pull.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.096
He gave it a shot.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.798
As far as I'm concerned, he now owns

19:48.800 --> 19:51.568
- "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
- [all laughing]

19:51.570 --> 19:53.604
- Walt?
- Still easy, "Twilight Zone."

19:53.605 --> 19:55.005
The gremlin on the plane.

19:55.007 --> 19:57.607
- You took mine, man!
- You took mine.

19:57.609 --> 19:59.910
- I would've totally done that.
- That's the only one I know.

19:59.912 --> 20:02.813
[all laughing]

20:02.815 --> 20:04.280
Mr. Shatner,

20:04.282 --> 20:06.134
Bill, thank you for having me.

20:06.575 --> 20:08.107
You are... I mean, I hate to say it,

20:08.109 --> 20:10.276
but you're boldly going
where few have gone before.

20:10.278 --> 20:11.944
Well, I hope so,

20:11.946 --> 20:13.695
'cause it's something new in comic books.

20:13.698 --> 20:17.116
And that pleases me more than anything.

20:17.118 --> 20:18.751
I feel lucky as hell.

20:18.753 --> 20:20.753
This man has been talked to and interviewed

20:20.756 --> 20:22.204
by everybody on the planet, right?

20:22.207 --> 20:24.289
But still, you know, I set phasers to stun.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.792
I went in there, and we
talked about everything.

20:26.795 --> 20:28.595
Captain Clerk met Captain Kirk.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.124
- Ah.
- Thank you very much.

20:30.452 --> 20:32.481
But just like his... his character,

20:32.780 --> 20:34.647
he's not content to keep
his feet on the ground.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.782
He's always chasing after
the stars and whatnot.

20:36.785 --> 20:38.417
He's got to be out there first.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.619
- 22nd-century man.
- You ain't kiddin'.

20:40.622 --> 20:42.823
[all laughing]

20:42.825 --> 20:45.092
Oh, man, it's time to
break off the captain's log

20:45.094 --> 20:46.492
and trek out of here.

20:46.494 --> 20:48.394
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:48.396 --> 20:49.996
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.565
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:51.567 --> 20:56.202
Our 5-year mission to boldly go where
no comic book man has gone before.

20:56.204 --> 20:57.636
Good night, kids.
