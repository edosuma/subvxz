THE STITCHES AND THE SNAKES
ARE DEFINITELY POST-MORTEM.

ARE STILL WAITING
FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

10:11.500 --> 10:13.250
TO RETURN OUR SNAKES.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.208
- KEEP ME UPDATED.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.125
YALE
IS LOOKING INTO OUR VIC.

WITH THE SALAS CARTEL.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.417

THIS IS DRUG-RELATED?

10:20.417 --> 10:24.500

A SNAKE IS A SNITCH.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.917
IF THIS WASN'T
A WARNING TO OTHERS

10:25.917 --> 10:27.625
TO KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT,

10:27.625 --> 10:28.959
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT THE MESSAGE IS.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.750
- MAYBE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE

10:30.750 --> 10:34.709
IS IN A LANGUAGE
ONLY I UNDERSTAND.

10:34.709 --> 10:38.291
- WHAT IS THAT HOLY PIECE
OF SHIT DOING HERE?

10:38.291 --> 10:41.291
- I KNOW THAT PIECE OF SHIT.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.291
OR AT LEAST I DID.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.959
- RIVERA WORKED
AT BROTHER SAM'S GARAGE

10:44.959 --> 10:46.667
AFTER HE GOT OUT OF JAIL.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.834
HEY, I DON'T LIKE IT
ANY MORE THAN ANY OF YOU.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.083
MAYBE THE PADRE POINTS US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.834
- GUY LIKE THAT
AND HIS EX-CON FUCKING FRIENDS

10:54.834 --> 10:58.041
CAN GO TO HELL
FOR ALL I CARE.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.834
- BROTHER SAM?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.125
- ONE BIG, BAD EX-CON
TURNED MINISTER.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.500
RUNS AN AUTO BODY SHOP
USING FORMER INMATES.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.208
AND, AS YOU CAN SEE,
SOME OF OUR BROTHERS IN BLUE

11:07.208 --> 11:09.291
THINK IT'S A SHAM.

11:09.291 --> 11:10.709
- THEY MAY BE RIGHT.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.750
THAT CAN'T BE

THE SMELL OF PERFUME.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.333

11:44.333 --> 11:46.583
I THINK

THE BETTER.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.000

12:15.709 --> 12:19.458
- A FEW MONTHS AGO.
HE CAME IN.

12:19.458 --> 12:23.834
HE NEEDED SOME BRAKES
FOR HIS PICKUP.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.875
HE BROUGHT, UH...

12:25.875 --> 12:30.041
RIPE GRAPEFRUITS
AND ORANGES.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.875
IT WAS A GOOD DAY.

12:34.917 --> 12:35.959
[clears throat]
SO ARE YOU--

12:35.959 --> 12:37.458
ARE YOU GUYS ANY CLOSER
TO FINDING OUT

12:37.458 --> 12:38.709
WHO DID THIS TO HIM?

12:38.709 --> 12:41.834
- WELL,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

12:41.834 --> 12:45.875
BUT I NEED
SOMETHING TO GO ON.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.583
- WHEN I KNEW BROTHER SAM,
HE WAS SAMUEL WRIGHT.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.625
A STRING OF HOLDUPS
LED TO THE INEVITABLE.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.250
ONE OF HIS VICTIMS
FOUGHT BACK

12:54.250 --> 12:56.250
AND WRIGHT KILLED HIM.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.917
I WAS READY TO MAKE
MY MOVE

12:57.917 --> 13:00.250
UNTIL A DRUG BUST TOOK WRIGHT
OFF MY TABLE.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.417
- AND YOU NEVER SAW RIVERA

13:01.417 --> 13:03.333
HANGING OUT
WITH ANY OF HIS OLD CREW?

13:03.333 --> 13:06.625
- NO, I DIDN'T.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.583
OMAR HAD MOVED
PAST THAT WORLD.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.792
HE WAS ON A RIGHTEOUS PATH.
- [chuckles]

13:11.792 --> 13:13.959
IT'S--IT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE I REMEMBER YOU

13:13.959 --> 13:16.542
SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT
THE LAST EX-CON YOU VOUCHED FOR.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.417
REMEMBER VICTOR TORRES?

13:18.417 --> 13:22.125
HE GETS PAROLED AND GOES OUT
AND KILLS A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.959
- THERE'S NOT A DAY
THAT GOES BY

13:23.959 --> 13:25.583
THAT I DON'T PRAY
FOR THAT GIRL

13:25.583 --> 13:27.375
OR REACH OUT TO HER FAMILY.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.792
- WELL, HER BLOOD'S
ON YOUR HANDS.

13:28.792 --> 13:29.875
- THERE'S A LOT MORE

13:29.875 --> 13:31.792
THAN THAT GIRL'S BLOOD
ON MY HANDS.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.583
MY PAST,

13:35.583 --> 13:37.291
THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE,

13:37.291 --> 13:38.625
THE LIFE THAT I LIVED,

13:38.625 --> 13:40.125
IS HAUNTING ME
TO THIS DAY.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.083
- BULLSHIT.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.000
- I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS

13:42.000 --> 13:44.125
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:44.125 --> 13:46.959
OR THE WORK THAT I DO
OR THE MEN THAT I DO IT WITH.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.667
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS.

13:48.667 --> 13:52.875
OMAR DID NOT HAVE THIS
COMING.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.667
HIS DEMONS WERE GONE.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.792
MEN CAN CHANGE.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.417
- MEN MAYBE.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.166
- ARE WE DONE?
- YEAH.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.542
THANKS FOR COMING IN.
- OKAY.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.458
- BUT WHAT ABOUT A MONSTER?

14:22.709 --> 14:24.667
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
SIR?

14:24.667 --> 14:28.000
- I REMEMBER
WHEN I HAD THIS OFFICE.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.792
MIAMI WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE.

14:30.792 --> 14:34.000
CORRUPTION WAS EVERYWHERE.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.792
- MY DAD SAID YOU NEVER KNEW
WHO YOU COULD TRUST BACK THEN.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.583
- HARRY WAS ONE
OF THE GOOD ONES.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.125
AND SO ARE YOU.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.709
- THANK YOU, SIR.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.542
THAT MEANS A LOT.

14:47.542 --> 14:50.166
- IT'S WHY I'M MAKING YOU
HOMICIDE'S NEW LIEUTENANT.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.542
- [laughs]
ME, RIGHT. LIEUTENANT.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.417
FUCKBALLS, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

14:55.417 --> 14:57.875
OH, F--SIR.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.709
- YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT
THIS DEPARTMENT NEEDS.

14:59.709 --> 15:01.500
A FRESH FACE, NEW IDEAS.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.750
- WAIT, REALLY?

15:03.750 --> 15:05.375
YOU WANT ME IN CHARGE?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.208
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.166
- WELL, YES WOULD WORK.
- BUT THIS IS BATISTA'S JOB.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.333
HE'S EXPECTING IT.
HE'S EARNED IT.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.000
- WELL, SERGEANT BATISTA'S
A FINE OFFICER,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.709
BUT HE COMES WITH
CERTAIN, UH, BAGGAGE.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.333
BESIDES, HE'S NOT A HERO.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.500
YOU ARE.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.834
- WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP SAYING THAT?

15:23.834 --> 15:24.959
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.083
- THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.667
THAT'S NOT HOW
THE CITY SEES IT.

15:27.667 --> 15:31.458
NO. THIS OFFICE NEEDS
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

15:31.458 --> 15:34.959
- OH, MY GOD.
DEXTER WOULD FLIP OUT.

15:34.959 --> 15:38.667
AND POOR MASUKA. I'D BE
THAT LITTLE FUCK'S BOSS.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.583
I'D BE EVERYBODY'S BOSS.

15:41.583 --> 15:45.750
THIS IS AN HONOR.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.041
DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M READY
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

15:48.041 --> 15:51.458
- LISTEN, I KNOW THIS IS
A LOT TO TAKE IN.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.417
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT MORE
TOMORROW, OKAY?

15:55.959 --> 16:00.625
CONGRATULATIONS,
LIEUTENANT.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.417
- LIEUTENANT.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.625
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON TODAY?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.959
- KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE BOUNCING BALL

16:19.959 --> 16:23.458
AND NOT ON DADDY'S
BAD PICTURES.

16:23.458 --> 16:26.291
SAMUEL WRIGHT KILLED
THIS STORE OWNER IN COLD BLOOD.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.208
BASHED IN HIS HEAD
WITH A BOTTLE.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.750
NOW HE'S CALLING HIMSELF
BROTHER SAM,

16:30.750 --> 16:32.917
PROFESSING TO BE
A CHANGED MAN.

16:32.917 --> 16:33.959
BUT I CAN'T TELL IF I'M SEEING

16:33.959 --> 16:36.041
A MAN WHO'S CHANGED
FOR THE BETTER

16:36.041 --> 16:38.208
OR JUST A BETTER COVER.

16:38.208 --> 16:39.083
- DADDY'S BOX.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.542
- YOU WANT TO PUT THIS
IN DADDY'S BOX?

16:44.542 --> 16:45.875
THANK YOU.

16:47.792 --> 16:52.041
- IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY
HE WAS JUST LEARNING TO CRAWL.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.000
- DADDY'S BOX.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.667
- OR HE'S PUTTING
ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.500
WHAT I SAY, WHAT I DO.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.333
- WHERE THINGS GO.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.667
- I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.166
- IS THAT GONNA BE ENOUGH?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.959
[knock on door]

17:13.834 --> 17:16.834
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOMICIDE'S
NEW FUCKING LIEUTENANT.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.625
I KNOW, RIGHT?

17:18.625 --> 17:20.458
GOT ANY BEER?

17:20.458 --> 17:21.667
[door closes]

17:21.667 --> 17:27.291
- THAT'S QUITE THE DAY.
LIEUTENANT.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.917
- NOPE.

17:28.917 --> 17:33.875
TWO BEERS IN, AND IT STILL
SOUNDS FUCKING WEIRD.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.917
I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:36.917 --> 17:40.208
AND IT TOTALLY DICKS
BATISTA.

17:40.208 --> 17:44.208
WHAT COULD MATTHEWS
POSSIBLY BE THINKING?

17:44.208 --> 17:46.750
- THAT YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE DRIVEN,

17:46.750 --> 17:48.792
YOU'RE A GREAT DETECTIVE.

17:48.792 --> 17:51.875
WHO'LL BE LEADING THE DEPARTMENT
THAT MAY HUNT ME DOWN ONE DAY.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.625
[sighs]

17:53.625 --> 17:55.375
YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF
SOME CREDIT.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.583
- YOU SHOULD GIVE ME
ANOTHER BEER.

17:56.583 --> 18:00.500
I'M EMPTY HERE.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.000
YOU EVER WONDER WHY DAD
NEVER MADE LT?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.458
- HE HAD HIS HANDS FULL.
WITH ME.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.750
- EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT HIM
LIKE HE WAS SOME SUPER COP,

18:07.750 --> 18:10.166
BUT HE STAYED IN THE PEN
HIS WHOLE CAREER.

18:10.166 --> 18:13.333
- MAYBE HE NEVER WANTED IT.

18:13.333 --> 18:16.417
- YOU KNOW,
AFTER HIS FUNERAL,

18:16.417 --> 18:21.458
A TINY PART OF ME
WAS RELIEVED.

18:21.458 --> 18:26.417
I TRIED SO HARD TO GET HIM
TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.834
AND I THOUGHT WITH HIM GONE,

18:27.834 --> 18:30.542
I WOULDN'T NEED HIS APPROVAL
ANYMORE, BUT...

18:30.542 --> 18:31.750
[laughs]

18:31.750 --> 18:33.458
20 YEARS LATER,
I STILL DO.

18:33.458 --> 18:36.125
HE'S STILL UP HERE
IN MY HEAD.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.417
- YOU DON'T SAY.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.083
- THE WEIRD THING IS,
IF I TAKE THIS JOB,

18:40.083 --> 18:43.583
I'LL HAVE ACHIEVED MORE
THAN HE EVER DID ON THE FORCE.

18:43.583 --> 18:46.208
AND THAT'S THE PART THAT SCARES
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.792
- NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.083
- DAD WAS MY LITMUS TEST

18:49.083 --> 18:51.917
FOR WHAT A REAL COP
IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.750
AND IF HE NEVER MADE
LIEUTENANT--

18:53.750 --> 18:56.125
- THEN YOU HAVE NO ONE
TO COMPARE YOURSELF TO.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.625
- AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
FUCKING LAGUERTA.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.792
- [laughs]

18:58.792 --> 19:02.375
- SO HOW WOULD I EVEN KNOW
IF I WAS DOING A GOOD JOB?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.500
I'D BE TOTALLY ALL ON MY OWN
ON THIS.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.875
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
THE JOB, DON'T TAKE IT.

19:06.875 --> 19:10.250
- FUCK YOU.
OF COURSE I WANT IT.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.375
[laughs] HOLY SHIT,
I REALLY WANT IT.

19:13.375 --> 19:17.959
[phone ringing]

19:17.959 --> 19:19.959
- QUINN AGAIN.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.458
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES HE WANT?

19:21.458 --> 19:24.166
- OUT ON A LIMB HERE,
BUT MAYBE AN ANSWER

19:24.166 --> 19:26.125
AS TO WHETHER YOU
WANT TO BE DEBRA QUINN?

19:26.125 --> 19:29.333
- JESUS H. FUCK,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.041
- [laughs]
DEBRA QUINN.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.625
YOUR INITIALS
WOULD BE DQ.

19:33.625 --> 19:34.583
LIKE THE--

19:34.583 --> 19:36.208
- I WILL KILL YOU.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.792
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.834
I'VE GOT TO STALL.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.500
CAN I SLEEP HERE?

19:45.500 --> 19:48.125
ABOUT ONE LIFE-ALTERING DECISION
A DAY IS MY MAX.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.458
- YEAH. I'LL SLEEP ON THE COUCH
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.834
- THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SUCK
AS A BROTHER.

19:52.834 --> 19:57.458
- YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT
AS A FATHER?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.125
[water running]

20:10.834 --> 20:14.166
[dishes clatter]

20:29.083 --> 20:30.041
- AAH!

20:30.041 --> 20:31.083
OH, TRAVIS!

20:31.083 --> 20:33.166
GOD DAMN IT.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.709
- REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T
USE THAT WORD.

20:35.709 --> 20:36.750
- WELL, MAYBE I WOULDN'T

20:36.750 --> 20:40.542
IF MY BROTHER WOULD
USE THE DOORBELL.

20:40.542 --> 20:43.250
[sighs, then laughs]

20:43.250 --> 20:46.000
YOU REALLY SCARED ME.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.041
SLOW DOWN.

20:54.041 --> 20:57.208
AND SAVE SOME ROOM
FOR DESSERT.

20:57.208 --> 21:00.125
- I TOLD YOU
I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.667
- YOU'RE WORKING TOO MUCH.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.250
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR FACE.

21:07.458 --> 21:10.208
- I LIKE TO KEEP BUSY.

21:10.208 --> 21:11.458
- YOU WANT BUSY,

21:11.458 --> 21:14.917
TRY KEEPING A BUNCH OF
FIFTH GRADERS FOCUSED ON ART.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.417
TODAY, ALL THEY
COULD TALK ABOUT WAS,

21:16.417 --> 21:19.917
THEY FOUND ANOTHER FLOCK OF
THOSE DEAD BIRDS UP NORTH.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.709
THEY THINK IT'S THE END
OF THE WORLD OR SOMETHING.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.417
- WHAT IF IT WERE?

21:27.417 --> 21:31.250
- UH, THEN I'D SAY WE BETTER
EAT THIS ICE CREAM FAST.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.625
- NO, I-I-I CAN'T STAY.
I HAVE TO GO.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.625
- OH, COME ON.
BLOW OFF WORK FOR ONCE.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.375
FOR ME.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.667
I BARELY GET TO SEE YOU
ANYMORE.

21:39.667 --> 21:43.166
- WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE...

21:43.166 --> 21:45.250
- BEFORE WHAT?

21:47.667 --> 21:49.041
- [sighs]

21:49.041 --> 21:51.500
IT'S NOTHING.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.166
- TRAVIS, WE USED TO BE
SO CLOSE.

21:55.166 --> 21:58.542
WE USED TO TALK
AND DO THINGS.

21:58.542 --> 22:02.500
NOW IT'S LIKE PULLING TEETH
JUST TO SEE YOU FOR AN HOUR.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
I MISS YOU.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.792
- I MISS YOU TOO.

22:07.792 --> 22:11.709
- THEN LET ME SPEND AN EVENING
WITH MY BABY BROTHER.

22:11.709 --> 22:14.250
PLEASE?

22:40.917 --> 22:42.959
[crash]

22:42.959 --> 22:45.458
- NOW, WHO PUT THAT THERE?

22:53.834 --> 22:55.542
[groans]

22:58.792 --> 23:01.208
GOOD THING I HAVE JUST THE PLACE
TO GET THIS FIXED.

23:01.208 --> 23:04.417
[chatter]

23:04.417 --> 23:07.542
[both speaking Spanish]

23:19.500 --> 23:21.917
IF BROTHER SAM BELIEVES
IN GIVING MEN LIKE THIS

23:21.917 --> 23:23.917
A SECOND CHANCE,

23:23.917 --> 23:27.125
WHO AM I TO DENY HIM ONE
ON MY TABLE?

23:27.125 --> 23:29.959
- YOU HERE ABOUT EDDIE?

23:29.959 --> 23:32.208
- WHAT?

23:32.208 --> 23:35.667
- EDDIE.
YOU HERE ABOUT EDDIE?

23:35.667 --> 23:36.625
HIS PAROLE AGENT.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.083
- OH, NO,
I'M JUST A CUSTOMER.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.458
I DINGED MY CAR.

23:39.458 --> 23:42.542
IS, UH, BROTHER SAM HERE?

23:42.542 --> 23:46.208
- HE'S OUT BACK.

23:56.625 --> 23:57.667
- CAN I HELP YOU?

23:57.667 --> 23:59.542
- YEAH. I WAS HOPING
TO GET AN ESTIMATE.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.834
- YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE,
ARE YOU?

24:02.834 --> 24:04.959
- YOUR SHOP CAME
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.834
- BY WHO?

24:06.834 --> 24:09.208
- CO-WORKER.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.750
- YOU OUT FRONT?
- MM-HMM.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.583
WAS THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT?

24:19.583 --> 24:22.750
OR HIS DARK PASSENGER
CHECKING OUT MINE?

24:22.750 --> 24:26.583
- YEAH, MY GUYS CAN
HAVE THIS OUT IN A DAY OR TWO.

24:29.959 --> 24:34.417
- GOOD SHEPHERD.
WHAT'S THAT MEAN, EXACTLY?

24:34.417 --> 24:38.250
- WELL, UH, THE MEN
YOU SEE HERE,

24:38.250 --> 24:40.083
THEY'RE LIKE MY FLOCK.

24:40.083 --> 24:43.125
AND, UH, MY JOB
IS TO MAKE SURE

24:43.125 --> 24:46.208
THAT THEY DON'T WANDER.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.000
- THAT'S A LOT TO TAKE ON.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.333
- YEAH, WELL, I GOT A LOT
TO ANSWER FOR.

24:50.333 --> 24:53.208
- [speaking Spanish]

24:53.208 --> 24:55.583
- NOTHING BROKE THAT
CAN'T BE FIXED, RIGHT?

24:55.583 --> 24:56.625
- [speaking Spanish]

24:56.625 --> 24:57.583
- [laughs]

24:57.583 --> 24:59.291
LORD HAVE MERCY.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.583
NO CAR IS EVER TOTALED.

25:02.583 --> 25:05.166
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
A MAN'S LIFE.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.333
LIKE A MAN'S SOUL.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.458
I OUGHTA KNOW THAT.

25:10.166 --> 25:14.000
YOU KNOW, I ONCE KILLED A MAN
AND WALKED OFF SCOT-FREE?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.333
FOR THAT I NEED...

25:15.333 --> 25:18.166
- TO PAY.
- TO PAY.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.375
- I'M SURPRISED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.333
- DON'T BE.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.375
THE SPIRIT MOVES ME

25:22.375 --> 25:25.333
TO TELL MY STORY
AND SHARE.

25:25.333 --> 25:28.166
I WAS FACING DEATH ROW.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.166
THE JUDGE PRESIDING
OVER MY CASE

25:31.166 --> 25:32.750
SUDDENLY DROPPED DEAD.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.083
- MISTRIAL?

25:34.083 --> 25:35.583
[laughs]

25:35.583 --> 25:37.959
YEAH. IT SOUNDS LIKE
DIVINE INTERVENTION.

25:37.959 --> 25:39.000
- YEAH.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
OH, GOD WAS PLAYING ME
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.083
I HAD TO GO OUT HERE
AND GET GOOD AND HIGH

25:45.083 --> 25:47.709
BEFORE HE JUST SAID, SON,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

25:47.709 --> 25:51.041
AND, UH, I GET STOPPED.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.375
POSSESSION CHARGE.
I GO BACK TO JAIL.

25:53.375 --> 25:56.208
BUT HALLELUJAH,
PRAISE GOD,

25:56.208 --> 25:58.458
THAT'S HOW I GOT SAVED.

25:58.458 --> 26:01.041
- SO THAT DARKNESS INSIDE,
IT'S GONE?

26:01.041 --> 26:03.583
- NO.

26:03.583 --> 26:07.750
IT'S STILL THERE, BUT I'M
FIGHTING ITS ASS EVERY DAY.

26:07.750 --> 26:11.166
I REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE, YOU KNOW?

26:12.625 --> 26:16.792
I SACRIFICED
THAT BAD PART OF MY SOUL

26:16.792 --> 26:19.667
TO MAKE UP FOR SOME
OF THE PAIN I CAUSED.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.166
- NICK STILL HASN'T SHOWED.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.417
- YOU FIND HIM AND YOU TELL HIM
I'M COMING FOR HIM,

26:26.417 --> 26:27.792
YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:27.792 --> 26:30.875
NOW.
TELL HIM NOW.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.667
- ONE OF THE FLOCK GET LOST?

26:37.667 --> 26:40.750
- YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

26:40.750 --> 26:41.667
[clears throat]

26:41.667 --> 26:45.625
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY THERE,
BROTHER?

26:49.166 --> 26:51.709
- GUESS I'LL BE
SEEING YOU SOON.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.417
- ALL RIGHT.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.125
YOU HAVE A BLESSED DAY.

26:59.917 --> 27:03.291
- ONCE WE WORK OUR MAGIC,
WE PUT IT UP ON THE BOARD HERE.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.375
- WHAT ARE THE ABBREVIATIONS?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.166
- WHAT WAS RUN.
UH, TR IS TRACE.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.750
TX, TOXICOLOGY.

27:08.750 --> 27:12.041
- SO WHERE DOES EVERYTHING GO
AFTER IT'S BEEN RUN?

27:12.041 --> 27:14.125
- INQUISITIVE.
I LIKE.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.417
[both laugh]

27:15.417 --> 27:17.458
EVIDENCE, DOWN THE HALL.

27:17.458 --> 27:21.000
- WHOA. COOL.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.333
- OH, YEAH. MEDICAL EXAMINER
FINALLY SENT 'EM OVER.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.375
THEY DON'T
MAKE YOU SQUEAMISH?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.041
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

27:29.041 --> 27:31.291
I LOVE THIS.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.792
- ME TOO.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.834
- VINCE.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.083
HANDS OFF.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.208
- SHE'S MY STUDENT.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.166
- YEAH, AND A LAWSUIT
LANDING ON MY DESK

27:49.166 --> 27:50.500
IF SHE CATCHES YOU
STARING LIKE THAT.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.625
- SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S EXPECTING

27:51.625 --> 27:53.792
TO MAKE
LIEUTENANT BUZZ-KILL.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.709
- TAKE THESE FILES
DOWN TO CENTRAL BOOKING.

28:02.709 --> 28:05.208
HAVE THEM CROSS REFERENCED
WITH THE CI LAB

28:05.208 --> 28:06.417
AND GET BACK TO ME
RIGHT AWAY.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.792
- YES, SIR.

28:13.959 --> 28:14.917
[pouring coffee]

28:14.917 --> 28:18.333
- WOW.
YOU REALLY DRINK THAT SWILL?

28:19.625 --> 28:21.583
- KEEPS ME YOUNG.

28:21.583 --> 28:22.667
- HOW ABOUT WE GO
AROUND THE CORNER

28:22.667 --> 28:23.583
AND I BUY YOU
A REAL CUP OF COFFEE?

28:23.583 --> 28:27.417
MY TREAT.
- OKAY.

28:27.417 --> 28:30.500
- DEXTER,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.542
- YEAH, I NEED TO GET
TO MY LAB.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.583
- HAS DEB MENTIONED
ANYTHING TO YOU,

28:33.583 --> 28:34.542
YOU KNOW, ABOUT US?

28:34.542 --> 28:35.709
- SHE, UH,
SAID YOU PROPOSED.

28:35.709 --> 28:36.625
- AND?

28:36.625 --> 28:38.375
- THE PANCAKES WEREN'T BAD.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.208
- AW, I FUCKED THIS UP
ROYALLY, DIDN'T I?

28:40.208 --> 28:41.500
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.750
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU AND I
HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

28:43.750 --> 28:45.458
BUT IT WOULD REALLY
MEAN A LOT TO ME

28:45.458 --> 28:47.250
IF YOU COULD
HELP ME OUT HERE.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.750
- WELL, THIS IS BETWEEN
YOU AND DEB.

28:48.750 --> 28:49.834
- NO, I KNOW.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.709
IT'S JUST, I DON'T
WANT HER TO FEEL

28:51.709 --> 28:55.959
LIKE SHE HAS TO, YOU KNOW,
CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU OR ME.

28:55.959 --> 28:57.709
- SHE DOESN'T.

28:57.709 --> 29:00.875
BECAUSE IT IS NEVER
GOING TO BE YOU.

29:01.792 --> 29:03.041
- NO, I GOT IT.

29:03.041 --> 29:06.333
- I SAID IT WAS MY TREAT.
- I GOT IT. HERE.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.166
I CAN AFFORD IT.

29:09.291 --> 29:12.208
WHAT IS IT?

29:13.625 --> 29:17.750
- I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

29:17.750 --> 29:21.125
THAT I'M THE DETECTIVE I AM
BECAUSE OF YOU.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.458
- THANK YOU.

29:23.458 --> 29:26.291
- AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS,

29:26.291 --> 29:27.750
ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.458
AND, MORE THAN THAT,
YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY TO ME.

29:30.458 --> 29:31.959
- WHERE IS THIS GOING?

29:33.750 --> 29:34.917
- DON'T LOOK AT ME
FOR A SECOND.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.917
- DEB.

29:39.750 --> 29:43.917
- ANGEL, MATTHEWS HAS ASKED ME
TO BE THE NEW LIEUTENANT.

29:45.166 --> 29:48.041
I'M SORRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED THIS.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.000
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.291
- THAT YOU SHOULD BE
THE NEW LIEUTENANT, NOT ME.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.959
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

29:56.959 --> 29:59.417
- HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

29:59.417 --> 30:02.250
I COULD NEVER, EVER DO THIS JOB
WITHOUT YOUR BLESSING,

30:02.250 --> 30:03.458
SO YOU JUST SAY THE WORD,

30:03.458 --> 30:06.583
AND I'LL TELL MATTHEWS
TO GO FUCK HIMSELF.

30:09.834 --> 30:13.834
- THIS...

30:13.834 --> 30:15.417
IS REALLY GREAT.

30:17.875 --> 30:19.333
- YOU MEAN THAT?

30:19.333 --> 30:20.625
- DAMN RIGHT.

30:20.625 --> 30:23.250
IT'S ABOUT TIME A REAL COP
HAD THAT JOB.

30:25.166 --> 30:26.792
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.458
COME HERE.

30:29.458 --> 30:32.792
I'M GONNA NEED
THAT MONEY BACK, THOUGH.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.750
- [laughs] OKAY.

30:38.166 --> 30:41.166
- ANGEL.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.834
- IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,
MARIA.

30:42.834 --> 30:45.250
- I JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT MORGAN.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.917
I'M SO SORRY.

30:46.917 --> 30:48.625
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.291
I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS
WHOLE LIEUTENANT THING ANYWAY.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.917
- LOOK, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

30:53.917 --> 30:56.834
MATTHEWS IS JUST USING MORGAN
TO GET BACK AT ME,

30:56.834 --> 30:58.041
BUT IT WON'T WORK.

30:58.041 --> 30:59.750
I MEAN, SHE'S BARELY
OUT OF DIAPERS.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.667
- DON'T DO THAT.

31:01.667 --> 31:04.208
DEB'S A GOOD DETECTIVE.

31:04.208 --> 31:05.709
BETTER THAN YOU EVER WERE.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.500
- LOOK, YOU'RE ANGRY, AND YOU
HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
BUT I WILL FIX THIS.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.542
I--
- ENOUGH, MARIA, ENOUGH.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.667
- ANGEL, I'M SO SORRY.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.208
- HOW COME
IF MATTHEWS HATES YOU,

31:19.208 --> 31:21.709
I'M ALWAYS THE ONE
PAYING THE PRICE?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.709
[engine starts]

31:44.542 --> 31:47.583
[engine starts]

31:55.542 --> 31:57.375
- THE GOOD SHEPHERD
HAS FLED HIS FIELD

31:57.375 --> 31:59.208
FOR SEEDIER PASTURES.

32:04.667 --> 32:06.917
THE QUESTION IS, WHY?

32:25.417 --> 32:29.291
[arguing in distance]

32:32.458 --> 32:34.917
[gunshot]

32:37.291 --> 32:39.375
[door slams]

32:48.834 --> 32:51.458
IT SEEMS OLD HABITS
DIE HARD.

32:51.458 --> 32:54.959
BROTHER SAM'S
NOT A CHANGED MAN AFTER ALL.

32:54.959 --> 32:56.959
HALLELUJAH.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.667
I CAN'T COME BACK
FOR BROTHER SAM

33:21.667 --> 33:25.333
UNTIL I MAKE SURE
HE KILLED THAT MAN.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.834
BUT WHILE I'M CHECKING,

33:27.834 --> 33:30.959
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.041
I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.667
BROTHER SAM
IS NO SHEPHERD.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.625
HE'S STILL A WOLF.

33:44.625 --> 33:49.959
[dog barking]

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
WELL, IT IS
AN ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.125
GOOD DOGGY.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.792
- WHO THE FUCK
IS OUT HERE?

34:04.792 --> 34:06.959
- SAM, IT'S ME.
I WAS HERE EARLIER. THE SUV.

34:06.959 --> 34:10.583
I LEFT MY CLICKER FOR MY GARAGE
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

34:10.583 --> 34:13.709
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TOO LATE TO CALL.

34:13.709 --> 34:14.834
DO YOU MIND?
- SIT!

34:14.834 --> 34:17.458
ELI!

34:17.458 --> 34:20.208
- [exhales]

34:21.834 --> 34:23.834
SORRY. I DIDN'T SEE
ANYONE HERE.

34:23.834 --> 34:25.500
I THOUGHT I WOULD BE
IN AND OUT.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.041
- YOUR CAR'S INSIDE.

34:28.041 --> 34:30.583
- MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
COME BACK TOMORROW.

34:30.583 --> 34:31.709
- NO.

34:33.250 --> 34:36.875
WE CAN GET IT OVER WITH
NOW.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.917
- OKAY.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.959
- ELI!

34:40.959 --> 34:43.125
[dog barks]

34:43.125 --> 34:45.166
- APPRECIATE IT.

34:50.166 --> 34:53.250
THIS ISN'T HOW I ENVISIONED
TAKING DOWN BROTHER SAM,

34:53.250 --> 34:56.250
BUT IT'S EITHER HIM OR ME
IF I WANT TO STAY...

34:57.750 --> 34:59.667
ALIVE?

34:59.667 --> 35:02.083
- GET OFF
THE MAN'S DAMN CAR.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.375
- CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HIT ME, MAN.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOOK A SHOT AT ME.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.417
- NOW I'M CONFUSED.

35:07.417 --> 35:10.083
TAKE ELI OUT BACK AND DON'T
YOU THINK ABOUT RUNNING OFF.

35:10.083 --> 35:11.333
I CHASED YOUR ASS DOWN ONCE.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.417
I'LL DO IT AGAIN.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

35:13.417 --> 35:15.250
- COME ON, BOY.

35:17.125 --> 35:20.583
[garage door opens]

35:20.583 --> 35:24.083
- YOUR MISSING WORKER.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.375
- YOU KNOW,
THE BIBLE SAYS

35:27.375 --> 35:28.667
DAVID BROKE A LAMB'S LEG

35:28.667 --> 35:30.333
TO PROTECT IT
FROM WANDERING OFF.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.750
I HAVE TO TEND TO MY FLOCK
ANY WAY I CAN.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.542
- DRUGS?
- YEAH.

35:36.542 --> 35:37.792
I KNEW
WHEN HE MISSED HIS SHIFT,

35:37.792 --> 35:40.500
HE WAS JUST HOLED UP
IN HIS HOUSE, GETTING HIGH.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.625
- THE GOOD SHEPHERD.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.250
- YEAH,
WHEN I HAVE TO BE.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.750
IT'S OPEN.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.667
THE CLICKER.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.500
- OH, RIGHT.

36:00.709 --> 36:02.333
I GOT IT...

36:02.333 --> 36:03.458
ALL WRONG.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.959
IS THIS WHAT THE POWER
OF BELIEF IS ALL ABOUT?

36:05.959 --> 36:08.458
KNOWING A DEAD FRUIT VENDOR
NEVER STRAYED.

36:08.458 --> 36:11.125
TENDING TO A LOST MEMBER
OF YOUR FLOCK.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.333
THE ABILITY TO CHANGE.

36:17.750 --> 36:18.917
WHAT IS IT?

36:18.917 --> 36:20.542
- NOTHING GOOD.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.709
STAY BACK.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.166
- WHERE'S OUR BOY?

36:31.166 --> 36:33.166
- SAFE. PLEASE GET
OFF THE PROPERTY.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.375
- FUCK YOU.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.542
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

36:37.667 --> 36:39.166
- THIS IS YOU STAYING BACK?

36:39.166 --> 36:40.792
THIS IS NOT YOUR FIGHT.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.875
- HEY, YOU DEAF, PENDEJO?

- [inhales deeply]

36:49.709 --> 36:50.750
YOU SHOULD PICK UP
YOUR FRIEND AND LEAVE.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.041
- OH, WE'RE GOIN'.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.333
- [groans]

36:53.333 --> 36:56.166
- BUT NOT WITHOUT
OUR BOY NICK.

37:01.917 --> 37:04.166
[tire iron clatters]

37:05.166 --> 37:08.500
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU,
SON.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.709
AND I DAMN SURE
AIN'T AFRAID TO DIE.

37:11.709 --> 37:13.709
I KNOW WHAT'S WAITING FOR ME
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.709
DO YOU? HMM?

37:15.709 --> 37:17.917
"MARK THE PERFECT MAN

37:17.917 --> 37:19.166
"AND BEHOLD THE UPRIGHT,

37:19.166 --> 37:20.875
FOR THE END OF THAT MAN
IS PEACE."

37:20.875 --> 37:23.083
- SHUT UP.

37:25.917 --> 37:29.375
- WHAT YOU WAITING FOR,
SON?

37:29.375 --> 37:30.875
- HE CAN'T TELL
IF BROTHER SAM IS BLUFFING,

37:30.875 --> 37:34.583
CRAZY,
OR A TRUE BELIEVER.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.417
JOIN THE CLUB.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.500
- YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
- FAITH, BROTHER.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.208
GOD IS IN CONTROL.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.917
- MIAMI METRO.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.041
YOU KILL HIM OR ME,

37:52.041 --> 37:55.375
YOU'LL HAVE THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT
AFTER YOU.

37:55.375 --> 37:58.917
- YO, JULIO, LET'S GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.291
- THIS AIN'T OVER.

38:00.291 --> 38:03.458
- WELL, UNTIL IT IS,
I'M PRAYING FOR YOU, SON.

38:03.458 --> 38:06.250
- WELL, YOU BEST BE PRAYING
I DON'T PUT YOU DOWN

38:06.250 --> 38:07.750
LIKE THE LAST FUCK-UP
THAT CROSSED ME.

38:07.750 --> 38:11.083
REMEMBER HECTOR NUNEZ?

38:11.083 --> 38:13.834
THEY NEVER FOUND HIS BODY,
DID THEY?

38:13.834 --> 38:15.667
[engine starts]

38:16.709 --> 38:18.834
[engine revs]

38:23.875 --> 38:24.834
- THAT WAS--

38:24.834 --> 38:27.166
- THAT WAS A MIRACLE.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.166
MIAMI METRO?

38:31.375 --> 38:33.583
- FORENSICS DEPARTMENT.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.166
LAB GEEK.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.291
THEY DIDN'T
NEED TO KNOW THAT.

38:36.291 --> 38:39.125
- YOU DON'T FIGHT
LIKE NO LAB GEEK.

38:39.125 --> 38:43.291
[laughs]

38:43.291 --> 38:44.500
LORD HAVE MERCY.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.458
IT'S JUST AN EVENING FULL
OF WONDERS TONIGHT, HUH?

38:48.458 --> 38:53.250
PRAISE GOD. THE LORD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.333
- YOU DON'T SAY.

39:13.458 --> 39:16.750
- WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

39:16.750 --> 39:18.834
- MY SISTER'S.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.625
SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT ME.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.750
I COULDN'T GET AWAY.

39:25.750 --> 39:29.375
- YOU KNOW THAT SHE
CAN'T BE SAVED, RIGHT?

39:29.375 --> 39:32.500
- SHE IS A GOOD PERSON.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
SHE'S ALL THAT I HAVE.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.333
- YOU KNOW
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

39:40.333 --> 39:44.083
YOU HAVE ME
AND YOU HAVE GOD NOW.

39:44.083 --> 39:46.166
BUT I SEE

39:46.166 --> 39:48.709
YOU HAVE TO BE
REMINDED OF THAT.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.834
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT,
TRAVIS?

40:01.333 --> 40:02.625
[groans]

40:02.625 --> 40:04.333
TO HURT ME.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.542
YOU SEE HOW I SUFFER
FOR YOUR SINS?

40:06.542 --> 40:08.041
- STOP!

40:09.917 --> 40:11.500
I WON'T SEE HER AGAIN.

40:12.834 --> 40:14.875
I WON'T.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.250
I SWEAR.

40:17.250 --> 40:21.583
- IT'S MY JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

40:21.583 --> 40:22.667
NOT HERS.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.542
- FORGIVE ME.

40:26.375 --> 40:30.291
I WILL DO BETTER.

40:30.291 --> 40:34.458
I WILL SHOW YOU
THAT I'M WORTHY.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.625
[crying]

40:40.917 --> 40:42.750
- [sighs]

40:46.959 --> 40:49.875
OH, FUCK ME.

40:53.291 --> 40:55.000
- HEY.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.417
SO...

40:57.625 --> 41:00.083
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.375
REALLY.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.166
- YOU KNOW, I FIGURED IF,
YOU KNOW,

41:03.166 --> 41:05.166
WE'RE GONNA TALK,
THEN WHY NOT OVER CHINESE

41:05.166 --> 41:07.291
FROM THAT PLACE YOU LIKE?

41:07.291 --> 41:09.625
BEER'S IN THE--
- I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.667
- FRIDGE.
- I'M SORRY.

41:11.667 --> 41:14.667
YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME,
BUT I CAN'T.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.500
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE WITH ME,

41:20.500 --> 41:22.125
THEN WHY ARE YOU WITH ME?

41:22.125 --> 41:24.709
- BECAUSE...

41:24.709 --> 41:27.333
IT WASN'T...

41:27.333 --> 41:28.959
THIS.

41:28.959 --> 41:30.417
- OH.

41:30.417 --> 41:34.709
I'M SORRY FOR WANTING TO BE
AN ADULT HERE, DEB, BUT--

41:34.709 --> 41:37.041
- I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOU.

41:37.041 --> 41:40.792
OR LEAD YOU ON.

41:40.792 --> 41:43.291
I JUST LIKE THINGS
THE WAY THEY ARE.

41:47.792 --> 41:49.583
- YEAH.

41:49.583 --> 41:51.542
THAT'S, UM,

41:51.542 --> 41:53.041
NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

41:53.041 --> 41:55.166
I WANT MORE.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.792
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:57.792 --> 42:00.625
I DON'T.

42:02.834 --> 42:06.542
YOU ARE A GREAT--
- YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST DON'T.

42:06.542 --> 42:09.500
DON'T BE HERE WHEN I
GET BACK, ALL RIGHT?

42:11.208 --> 42:12.625
[door slams]

42:14.542 --> 42:17.458
- OH,
AND I'M YOUR NEW BOSS.

42:35.917 --> 42:37.875
- JUST TELL THE LITTLE GUY
A STORY?

42:37.875 --> 42:39.959
- JAMIE PUT HIM TO BED.

42:39.959 --> 42:42.709
[typing]

42:42.709 --> 42:45.750
- LOOKS LIKE BROTHER SAM'S
A CHANGED MAN AFTER ALL.

42:45.750 --> 42:48.709
HE WAS TRUE TO HIS WORD
ABOUT BEING A GOOD SHEPHERD.

42:48.709 --> 42:51.083
HE PUT HIS OWN LIFE
ON THE LINE TO SAVE THAT KID

42:51.083 --> 42:52.375
FROM A PACK OF WOLVES.

42:52.375 --> 42:56.792
- AND HERE'S THE LEADER
OF THE PACK.

42:56.792 --> 42:59.041
- HARRISON EVENTUALLY IS GOING
TO NEED A GOOD SHEPHERD TOO.

43:01.041 --> 43:02.917
- I'LL BE THERE FOR HIM.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.458
- AND WHAT ABOUT HIM?

43:05.458 --> 43:08.417
- [takes deep breath]

43:08.417 --> 43:09.750
I WAS SET ON PROVING

43:09.750 --> 43:11.917
BROTHER SAM STILL DESERVES
TO BE ON MY TABLE,

43:11.917 --> 43:13.083
BUT MIRACULOUSLY,

43:13.083 --> 43:17.792
JULIO GOES AND VETS HIMSELF
TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

43:17.792 --> 43:20.667
HECTOR NUNEZ WAS A BARBER
IN JULIO'S NEIGHBORHOOD.

43:20.667 --> 43:22.917
WENT MISSING SIX MONTHS AGO.

43:22.917 --> 43:25.417
NO BODY.

43:25.417 --> 43:27.917
- THE ALMIGHTY AT WORK?

43:27.917 --> 43:31.417
- I'M NOT READY TO CALL JULIO
A SIGN FROM GOD,

43:31.417 --> 43:33.375
BUT I AM THANKFUL
FOR THE BOUNTY

43:33.375 --> 43:36.041
I AM ABOUT TO RECEIVE.

43:36.041 --> 43:38.417
[water running]

43:38.417 --> 43:39.834
[dishes clatter]

43:39.834 --> 43:41.417
- I HAVE ANY CLEAN SHIRTS?

43:41.417 --> 43:43.458
- YOUR ROOM.
OR FORMER ROOM.

43:43.458 --> 43:45.000
- DEB BEING HERE
IS TEMPORARY.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
- WHO DOESN'T
RINSE OUT THEIR BOWL?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.750
- TEMPORARY, I PROMISE.

43:49.750 --> 43:51.750
DEB.
[knocks]

43:51.750 --> 43:52.917
I NEED A SHIRT.

43:55.250 --> 43:57.792
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

43:57.792 --> 44:00.709
- DAD WOULD BE PROUD.

44:00.709 --> 44:02.375
- THANKS AGAIN FOR
LETTING ME CRASH HERE

44:02.375 --> 44:04.166
UNTIL I FIND A PLACE.

44:04.166 --> 44:06.750
- IT'S WHY I DON'T SUCK,
REMEMBER?

44:07.625 --> 44:10.291
JUST HELP JAMIE OUT
WHEN YOU CAN.

44:10.291 --> 44:14.291
- AM I MAKING THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE?

44:16.792 --> 44:18.709
- [sighs]

44:18.709 --> 44:20.291
I DON'T KNOW, DEB.

44:20.291 --> 44:21.458
AS HARRISON GETS OLDER,

44:21.458 --> 44:23.500
I'VE BEEN THINKING MORE
ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.458
I'M COMING TO FIND THAT
THE LIST IS KIND OF SHORT.

44:25.458 --> 44:26.917
[laughs]

44:26.917 --> 44:30.041
- WHAT DO ANY OF US
REALLY BELIEVE IN?

44:30.041 --> 44:33.208
- THAT YOU'LL BE
A GREAT LIEUTENANT.

44:33.208 --> 44:35.667
- [laughs]

44:35.667 --> 44:38.792
SCREW DAD. I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU PROUD OF ME.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.291
- DISSECTED
ALL SEVEN BABY SNAKES.

44:42.291 --> 44:43.667
STOMACHS WERE EMPTY.

44:43.667 --> 44:45.208
THEY DIDN'T COME
FROM A PET STORE.

44:45.208 --> 44:47.000
MOST LIKELY THE WILD.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.333
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.083
[click]

44:50.083 --> 44:53.041
[sighs]

44:53.041 --> 44:54.625
REMEMBER
BARRY MANILOW TICKETS.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.291
- TOXICOLOGY'S BACK.

44:56.291 --> 44:58.166
- ON--ON WHAT?
THE BOARD IS CLEAR.

44:58.166 --> 44:59.500
- THE SNAKES.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.709
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT I RAN TISSUE SAMPLES.

45:01.709 --> 45:05.166
- UH, WH--WHICH I, UH,
WOULD HAVE DONE.

45:05.166 --> 45:07.458
- AND LOOK.
HEAVY METALS.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.834
IF THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE BELLIES OF THE SNAKES,

45:08.834 --> 45:11.333
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

45:11.333 --> 45:15.834
- UH, FROM MAMA SNAKE.

45:15.834 --> 45:18.333
WHO HAD TO HAVE BEEN LIVING
IN A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT

45:18.333 --> 45:19.834
TO PASS IT ON TO HER YOUNG.

45:19.834 --> 45:21.583
- YOU WANNA LOOK UP
EPA CLEANUP SITES

45:21.583 --> 45:23.166
OR SHOULD I?

45:23.166 --> 45:26.458
- I'D RATHER LOOK UP YOUR--

45:26.458 --> 45:31.208
I MEAN, I DIDN'T--
I WASN'T--

45:31.208 --> 45:32.417
PLEASE DON'T SUE.

45:32.417 --> 45:35.583
- YOU LIKE TO WATCH.

45:35.583 --> 45:38.750
GOOD TO KNOW.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.750
- [exhales]

45:40.750 --> 45:41.750
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

45:41.750 --> 45:44.250
MORGAN AS LIEUTENANT?

45:44.250 --> 45:46.291
- YES. I WAS JUST SENDING OVER
THE PAPERWORK.

45:46.291 --> 45:47.875
- FUCK YOU, TOM.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.667
- YOU GET ONE OF THOSE
AS CAPTAIN,

45:49.667 --> 45:51.625
BUT DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK,
MARIA.

45:51.625 --> 45:54.250
- WE AGREED THE NEW LIEUTENANT
WOULD BE BATISTA.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.333
- I AGREED TO NOTHING.

45:55.333 --> 45:56.583
AND NEED I REMIND YOU

45:56.583 --> 45:57.583
THAT ALL PERSONNEL DECISIONS

45:57.583 --> 45:59.375
ARE ULTIMATELY MY DECISION.

45:59.375 --> 46:00.667
IF THEY WEREN'T,

46:00.667 --> 46:04.583
YOUR LITTLE PLAN TO BLACKMAIL ME
WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED.

46:04.583 --> 46:07.166
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A FUCKING DISASTER,

46:07.166 --> 46:08.667
AND I WON'T TAKE
THE FALL FOR IT.

46:08.667 --> 46:10.792
- WELL, WE'LL SEE,
WON'T WE?

46:10.792 --> 46:13.750
OH! BETTER HURRY.
DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

46:13.750 --> 46:15.000
- FOR WHAT?

46:15.000 --> 46:18.542
- YOUR FIRST OFFICIAL TASK,
CAPTAIN.

46:21.250 --> 46:22.792
- THE EVERGLADES?

46:22.792 --> 46:24.917
ALL 4,000 SQUARE MILES OF IT?
THAT'S YOUR BIG BREAK?

46:24.917 --> 46:26.417
- OH, I NEVER SAID
THE EVERGLADES.

46:26.417 --> 46:30.375
I SAID HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES
NEAR OR AROUND THE EVERGLADES.

46:30.375 --> 46:31.458
- IT WOULD EXPLAIN

46:31.458 --> 46:32.583
WHERE THE POLLUTANTS
IN THE SNAKES CAME FROM.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.583
- YEAH.
WE NARROWED THIS DOWN.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.917
SOMEONE COULD HAVE SEEN
THE BAD GUYS COMING OR GOING.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.875
- [sighs]

46:40.875 --> 46:43.250
I SUPPOSE IT'S A START.

46:43.250 --> 46:45.458
- WHAT GIVES
WITH ALL THE REPORTERS?

46:45.458 --> 46:48.750
- WE'RE GETTING
A NEW LIEUTENANT.

46:51.250 --> 46:53.542
- WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU SAY TO DEB?

46:53.542 --> 46:54.750
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

46:54.750 --> 46:56.208
- YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING WAS FINE

46:56.208 --> 46:57.792
UNTIL SHE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT YOUR PLACE.

46:57.792 --> 46:59.500
- YOU KNOW,
SHE'S MADE HER CHOICE,

46:59.500 --> 47:01.041
BUT IT'S NOT YOU OR ME.

47:01.041 --> 47:03.792
PRESS CONFERENCE
IS STARTING.

47:09.333 --> 47:11.583
- EVERYONE,

47:11.583 --> 47:15.000
THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.750
YOU'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE
IT'S MY PRIVILEGE

47:18.750 --> 47:21.542
TO INTRODUCE
AN OFFICER WHO--

47:21.542 --> 47:25.333
WELL, UNDER MY WATCH
HAS PROVEN HERSELF TO BE

47:25.333 --> 47:27.083
ONE OF MIAMI'S FINEST

47:27.083 --> 47:29.500
AND A TRUE FRIEND.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.834
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

47:30.834 --> 47:33.166
I GIVE YOU
THE YOUNGEST OFFICER

47:33.166 --> 47:34.208
EVER TO MAKE LIEUTENANT

47:34.208 --> 47:37.375
IN THE HISTORY
OF MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE--

47:37.375 --> 47:39.959
DEBRA MORGAN.

47:39.959 --> 47:44.500
[applause]

48:01.917 --> 48:04.542
- I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU,
JULIO.

48:04.542 --> 48:07.083
YOU RAN QUITE A RACKET.

48:07.083 --> 48:08.250
I READ ALL ABOUT

48:08.250 --> 48:12.875
HOW YOU WERE SHAKING DOWN
LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS

48:12.875 --> 48:15.834
LIKE HECTOR NUNEZ.

48:20.250 --> 48:21.458
- YOU.

48:21.458 --> 48:23.250
- YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS SHOP, DON'T YOU?

48:23.250 --> 48:24.333
- FUCK YOU.

48:24.333 --> 48:27.709
MY BOYS WILL FUCKIN'
KILL YOU FOR THIS.

48:27.709 --> 48:28.875
- LET ME GUESS.

48:28.875 --> 48:31.709
WITH YOUR HISTORY
OF VIOLENCE,

48:31.709 --> 48:35.166
HECTOR STOOD UP
TO YOU AND YOUR GANG

48:35.166 --> 48:38.166
AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEVER
FOUND HIS BODY.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.959
JUST THE WAY
THEY'LL NEVER FIND YOURS.

48:41.959 --> 48:44.083
- YEAH, I KILLED HIM.
SO WHAT?

48:44.083 --> 48:47.250
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.
MY BOYS WILL F--

48:48.375 --> 48:49.625
[muffled shout]

48:49.625 --> 48:51.291
- WILL MISS YOU,
I'M SURE.

48:51.291 --> 48:53.417
SO I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

48:53.417 --> 48:55.291
- [muffled screams]

48:56.625 --> 48:59.583
- I HAVE TO GET HOME.

48:59.583 --> 49:02.083
I HAVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
RITUAL TO TEND TO.

49:04.166 --> 49:07.709
YOU MUST BE THINKING "WHY ME"
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

49:07.709 --> 49:09.166
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT MYSELF.

49:09.166 --> 49:10.959
GOD.

49:10.959 --> 49:12.917
THE UNIVERSE.

49:12.917 --> 49:13.917
IRONY.

49:16.125 --> 49:19.959
BROTHER SAM WASN'T WHO
I THOUGHT HE WAS, BUT YOU...

49:19.959 --> 49:21.583
THIS...

49:21.583 --> 49:24.083
I KNOW ALL TOO WELL.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.375
ALWAYS THE SAME ENDING.

49:28.375 --> 49:29.917
- [muffled scream]

49:36.125 --> 49:40.583
- BECAUSE MONSTERS DON'T
GET TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

50:11.291 --> 50:13.208
[laughs]

50:15.417 --> 50:18.500
HANDS UP, AND...
[imitates explosion]

50:18.500 --> 50:21.125
GOOD JOB.

50:21.125 --> 50:23.667
THE GOOD THING ABOUT
THE MIND OF A TWO-YEAR-OLD--

50:23.667 --> 50:25.000
IT'S EASILY DISTRACTED.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.125
YOU WANT TO ROLL IT?

50:28.417 --> 50:30.417
OOH.

50:30.417 --> 50:34.000
HE WON'T REMEMBER DADDY'S BOX
IF HE HAS ONE OF HIS OWN.

50:38.166 --> 50:41.834
- MONSTER STORY, DADDY.

50:41.834 --> 50:45.083
- HOW ABOUT A NEW STORY?

50:48.166 --> 50:49.834
[gasps]

50:49.834 --> 50:54.250
"ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WERE THREE LITTLE PIGS.

50:54.250 --> 50:58.417
THE FIRST LITTLE PIG
BUILT A HOUSE OF STRAW."

50:59.542 --> 51:04.333
"THE SECOND,
A HOUSE OF STICKS.

51:04.333 --> 51:08.166
AND THE THIRD,
A HOUSE OF BRICKS."

51:10.834 --> 51:14.083
"BUT ALONG CAME
THE BIG, BAD WOLF."

51:15.375 --> 51:17.792
WOLVES COME IN MANY FORMS.

51:17.792 --> 51:21.750
SOME HAVE BIG EYES,
THE BETTER TO SEE YOU WITH.

51:21.750 --> 51:24.875
- YOU WANT TO CONNECT THIS PART.
THAT'S THE JOINER.

51:24.875 --> 51:28.083
- OTHERS HUFF AND PUFF...

51:28.083 --> 51:29.917
- HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- [sighs] NO.

51:29.917 --> 51:31.792
- WHILE OTHERS
HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT.

51:31.792 --> 51:32.834
- I THINK I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE.

51:32.834 --> 51:33.917
- REALLY? HERE,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

51:33.917 --> 51:35.000
- I HEARD SOMETHING SNAP.

51:35.000 --> 51:35.917
- WHAT, DID YOU FALL DOWN
OR SOMETHING?

51:35.917 --> 51:37.000
- YEAH.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.417
- I SHOULD KNOW,
BECAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT,

51:39.417 --> 51:40.417
I'M ONE TOO.

51:40.417 --> 51:43.375
THAT'S NEVER
GOING TO CHANGE.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.417
AND NEITHER IS THE FACT
MY LITTLE LAMB

51:50.417 --> 51:52.709
IS BECOMING A LITTLE BOY.

51:52.709 --> 51:56.875
WALKING. TALKING.
LISTENING.

51:59.375 --> 52:02.750
AS MUCH AS I WANT HARRISON
TO STAY THIS WAY FOREVER,

52:02.750 --> 52:04.750
FROM NOW ON,
THE ONLY WOLVES IN HIS LIFE

52:04.750 --> 52:08.000
HAVE TO BE THE STUFF
OF FAIRY TALES.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.125
I CAN NO LONGER ALLOW HIM
TO SEE THE REAL ME.

52:11.125 --> 52:14.375
ONLY THE VERSION
THAT'S MAKE-BELIEVE.

52:14.375 --> 52:17.500
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS STORY
GETS TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.
