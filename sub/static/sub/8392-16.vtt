WEBVTT

00:01.270 --> 00:02.191
- YOUR TESTS SHOW
THAT YOU HAVE A CONDITION

00:02.340 --> 00:03.648
KNOWN AS
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.

00:03.790 --> 00:05.929
- IT'S SERIOUS?

00:06.070 --> 00:07.719
- IT CAN ALSO LEAD
TO HEART FAILURE.

00:07.860 --> 00:08.929
- CAMILLE, I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD TELL THE KIDS RIGHT NOW.

00:09.070 --> 00:09.968
I NEED TO GET
MY HEAD AROUND IT.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.623
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

00:11.770 --> 00:14.238
- I'M IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH A GUY WHO'S YOUNGER,

00:14.390 --> 00:18.042
AND I WAS WONDERING ABOUT
HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

00:18.190 --> 00:20.420
- YES, BIOLOGICALLY
IT IS POSSIBLE.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.014
- DID YOU GIVE ME THIS JOB
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT

00:22.160 --> 00:24.845
I WOULD BE GOOD AT IT OR BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH ME?

00:24.990 --> 00:26.389
- YOU ARE SMART
AND YOU THINK FOR YOURSELF,

00:26.540 --> 00:28.087
THAT'S WHY
I GAVE YOU THE JOB.

00:28.230 --> 00:30.027
AND IT'S WHY
I KISSED YOU.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.068
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.609
- I LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR FIVE SECONDS,

00:43.760 --> 00:45.136
YOU'RE SHREDDING IMPORTANT
DOCUMENTS AGAIN?

00:45.280 --> 00:46.269
- IT'S LIKE WATERGATE
IN HERE.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.069
- HERE, I'M SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

00:48.220 --> 00:48.936
- SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG, I HAD
TO GET CREAM FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.559
IS IT BAD?
- WOW.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.873
IT'S LIKE REAL COFFEE BEANS
WERE INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.592
- LISTEN, SATURDAY'S GETTING
REALLY, REALLY BUSY AND--

00:55.740 --> 00:57.662
- I NEED YOU TO CLEAR
ALL MY COMMITMENTS THIS WEEKEND,

00:57.810 --> 00:59.084
BECAUSE I GOT INVITED
BY THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY

00:59.230 --> 01:02.393
SMALL-BUSINESS LEAGUE
TO SPEAK AT THEIR CONFERENCE.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.679
- OH, OKAY.
- IN SACRAMENTO.

01:04.820 --> 01:06.264
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

01:06.410 --> 01:07.911
- I WILL--
- I NEED YOU TO CLEAR

01:08.060 --> 01:10.437
YOUR SCHEDULE AS WELL.
- HUH.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.922
- YES, I NEED YOU THERE
TO HELP ME.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.276
- REALLY? HMM.
- YES.

01:13.410 --> 01:15.469
I AM A DISASTER
WITHOUT YOU.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.235
- I SEE.

01:17.380 --> 01:21.623
AND WOULD THIS BE
STRICTLY BUSINESS?

01:21.770 --> 01:23.761
- WE WILL DO
THE BUSINESS FIRST,

01:23.910 --> 01:25.969
AND THEN IF THERE'S ANY TIME
LEFI' OVER,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.736
WE WILL JUST PLAY IT BY EAR.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.978
- WE'LL TAKE GABE.

01:36.130 --> 01:36.949
- WE'LL TAKE JESSICA.

01:37.090 --> 01:40.093
- MM, ALYSSA.
- RORY.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.403
- CARLOS.
- WE'LL TAKE RICKY.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.199
- NO, WAIT, NO.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.614
I'M BETTER THAN
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.136
WHY AREN'T YOU
PICKING ME?

01:47.270 --> 01:48.168
- UH, MAX, WHY DON'T YOU
PLAY ON ALAN'S TEAM?

01:48.310 --> 01:49.299
- WHAT?
NO, WE'RE ALL FULL.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.758
- I'M JUST NOT
GOING TO PLAY.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.061
- I'M SORRY MAX,
BUT YOU HAVE TO PLAY.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.939
- WELL, MICAH DOESN'T
HAVE TO PLAY.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.968
WHY CAN'T I JUST
SIT OUT WITH HIM?

01:57.110 --> 02:00.523
- MAX, MICAH ISN'T PLAYING
BECAUSE MICAH HAS A DISABILITY.

02:00.670 --> 02:02.046
- OH.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.259
WELL, I HAVE
A DISABILITY TOO.

02:03.390 --> 02:07.804
YEAH, I HAVE ASPERGER'S.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.308
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK THERE

02:18.440 --> 02:20.260
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
CONFUSION HERE.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.162
UM, I'M HERE TO PICK UP
MY ALLERGY MEDICATION.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.345
- BRAVERMAN, RIGHT?

02:23.480 --> 02:25.823
- YEAH, CROSBY BRAVERMAN.
- OH.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.892
- THESE ARE FOR
ZEEK BRAVERMAN.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.029
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.386
THESE WERE CALLED IN
A WEEK AGO,

02:30.520 --> 02:31.839
AND HE NEVER
PICKED THEM UP.

02:31.970 --> 02:34.006
- OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S MY DAD.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.768
HEY, CAN YOU TELL ME,
WHAT'S ALL THAT MEDICATION FOR?

02:37.910 --> 02:39.286
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU
THAT INFORMATION, SIR.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.637
IT WOULD BREECH
HIS CONFIDENTIALITY. SORRY.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.771
- YOU KNOW, I COULD GOOGLE IT
AND JUST FIND OUT.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.467
OR YOU COULD JUST
TELL ME WHAT--

02:45.610 --> 02:47.840
- SIR.
- OKAY.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.811
JUST THE CAT ALLERGY
MEDICINE, THEN.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.302
I AM GOING TO GOOGLE IT,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.955
SO I WILL FIND OUT.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.306
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- NO, I'M GOOD.

02:57.450 --> 02:59.475
- YOU GOT IT?
- I GOT IT.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.679
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN, THOUGH? LIKE--

03:01.830 --> 03:04.105
KIDS GET LOLLIPOPS.
I DIDN'T GET A LOLLIPOP.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.218
I DIDN'T GET A STICKER.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.033
I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING.
- YOU DID GREAT.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.807
- I DID GREAT.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.567
- SO, UM, I KNOW BED REST IS NOT
THE MOST FUN THING TO HEAR,

03:11.700 --> 03:12.940
BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHAT TO DO

03:13.080 --> 03:14.707
ABOUT YOUR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.182
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE STRESSING OUT

03:16.330 --> 03:17.558
BECAUSE THE DOCTOR
HAPPENED TO MENTION

03:17.710 --> 03:18.847
THAT I'M STRESSED OUT.
- I'M NOT STRESSING OUT.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.776
- YES, YOU ARE.
- I'M JUST THINKING

03:20.920 --> 03:21.887
IT'LL BE GREAT TO LOCATE WHAT
IT IS THAT'S STRESSING YOU OUT

03:22.020 --> 03:23.578
AND FIX IT.
- OKAY, WELL, LET'S SEE.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.369
I'M 8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT,

03:25.510 --> 03:28.308
I HAVE NO BOYFRIEND, NO JOB,
I'M CONFINED TO A FUTON,

03:28.440 --> 03:30.852
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHEN MY LIFE WON'T SUCK.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.376
HOW ABOUT THAT?

03:32.520 --> 03:33.828
- WELL, I'M SURE THERE
ARE A COUPLE THINGS

03:33.970 --> 03:35.483
ON THAT LIST WE CAN TACKLE
THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

03:35.620 --> 03:36.518
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOUR TRYING
TO CONTROL MY STRESS

03:36.660 --> 03:38.696
IS REALLY
STRESSING ME OUT, OKAY?

03:38.830 --> 03:40.627
- OH.
- THANKS, BYE.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.726
- SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU LIVE?

03:42.870 --> 03:45.282
[lock clicks]

03:46.390 --> 03:47.948
- HEY, MOM, CAN I BORROW
YOUR TOOTH PASTE?

03:48.080 --> 03:49.354
- MM-HMM.
- THANKS.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.047
- GRANDMA OUT
OF TOOTHPASTE?

03:51.190 --> 03:53.465
- NO, BUT IT'S, LIKE,
NATURAL.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.123
- OH, GROSS, THEY SHOULD
HAVE LESS NATURAL FLAVORS

03:55.260 --> 03:58.400
LIKE CUPCAKE AND CHEESEBURGER
AND PEANUT BUTTER

03:58.540 --> 04:01.020
WOULD BE A GOOD FLAVOR.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.786
- UM...
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

04:03.930 --> 04:05.306
- WHAT?

04:05.450 --> 04:07.680
- WHAT IS THIS?
- OH, MY GOD.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.991
UH, I'M NOT PREGNANT,
I'M NOT, IT'S UM--

04:10.140 --> 04:13.689
THAT'S AN OVULATION KIT--
UH, TEST, IT'S A--

04:13.830 --> 04:15.388
- FOR WHAT?

04:15.530 --> 04:17.976
- IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU
USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING

04:18.110 --> 04:21.045
TO GET PREGNANT.

04:21.190 --> 04:24.114
- UM, WHY?
I DON'T--

04:24.260 --> 04:26.012
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.843
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

04:27.990 --> 04:31.642
- WELL, I'M WITH SOMEBODY
I LOVE, AND WE'RE SERIOUS.

04:31.780 --> 04:34.340
IT'S THE NEXT
NATURAL STEP.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.368
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT--
- YEAH.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.818
- I WOULD HAVE TALKED
TO YOU ABOUT IT,

04:37.960 --> 04:39.541
BUT THERE ARE A LOT
OF VARIABLES, YOU KNOW.

04:39.690 --> 04:40.998
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST REALLY WEIRD.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.926
- WAIT, WAIT,
HEY, HEY, HEY, WAIT.

04:43.070 --> 04:44.549
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:44.690 --> 04:46.624
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WANT ANOTHER BABY.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.204
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.521
I CAN'T SEE IT.
- WELL, HONEY,

04:49.660 --> 04:51.833
IT'S A BIG SHOCK
AND IT'S BRAND-NEW, BUT--

04:51.980 --> 04:53.698
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S JUST
ALREADY HAVE AMBER AND I.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.762
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE GOING TO--

04:55.910 --> 04:57.798
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT
MUCH TO SAY.

04:57.950 --> 05:01.909
I MEAN, I GUESS,
GOOD LUCK OR WHATEVER.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.219
- OH, GOD.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.782
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:07.920 --> 05:10.024
MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:10.170 --> 05:12.570
MAY YOU ALWAYS
DO FOR OTHERS

05:12.720 --> 05:16.440
AND LET OTHERS
DO FOR YOU

05:16.590 --> 05:19.935
MAY YOU BUILD
A LADDER TO THE STARS

05:20.070 --> 05:23.005
AND CLIMB ON
EVERY RUNG

05:23.150 --> 05:26.768
AND MAY YOU STAY
FOREVER YOUNG

05:26.910 --> 05:30.004
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:30.150 --> 05:33.904
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

05:34.050 --> 05:36.769
MAY YOU ALWAYS
KNOW THE TRUTH

05:36.920 --> 05:41.641
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:41.780 --> 05:44.294
MAY YOU ALWAYS
BE COURAGEOUS

05:44.440 --> 05:46.749
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:46.890 --> 05:49.859
AND MAY YOU STAY
FOREVER YOUNG

05:50.000 --> 05:51.513
MAY YOU STAY
FOREVER YOUNG

05:52.730 --> 05:54.618
- HE JUST KEPT SAYING,
"IT'S WEIRD, I DON'T KNOW,

05:54.760 --> 05:56.694
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD."

05:56.830 --> 05:59.071
- AH, WELL, I MEAN, IT IS--
IT IS WEIRD.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.619
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT LATER.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.829
IT IS WEIRD,
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA

06:02.980 --> 06:05.119
HOW CLOSE WE'VE GO'I'I'EN.
- RIGHT.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.773
- HOW FAST THINGS HAVE GONE,
AND NOW, OF COURSE,

06:06.910 --> 06:09.777
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE WE ARE.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.774
- NO, I MEAN,
IT'S SORT OF BEEN MY FAULT.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.080
I'VE TRIED TO KEEP
MY DISTANCE FROM HIM,

06:13.230 --> 06:15.334
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WHOLE
PHOTOGRAPH INCIDENT.

06:15.470 --> 06:17.028
JUST, LIKE, TRY NOT
TO EMBARRASS HIM.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.129
BUT MAYBE THAT WAS A MISTAKE,
MAYBE--

06:20.270 --> 06:23.683
MAYBE NOW I SHOULD JUST
TAKE HIM OUT AND SAY,

06:23.830 --> 06:26.412
"HEY, MAN, I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, NEITHER ARE YOU,

06:26.550 --> 06:29.348
SO LET'S TALK IT OUT."

06:29.490 --> 06:31.458
- DO YOU START ALL YOUR
BEST TALKS WITH, "HEY, MAN"?

06:31.590 --> 06:33.103
- YEAH, THAT'S THE KEY.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.387
THEY'RE LIKE "WHOA,
THIS GUY SPEAKS MY LANGUAGE."

06:34.530 --> 06:35.667
- YOU'RE LIKE
THE TEENAGER WHISPERER.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.732
- I AM.
- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE YOU'RE--

06:36.870 --> 06:38.041
- HEY, MAN.
- OH, WOW.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.737
- AND THEY JUST
CALM DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.529
WHOA, THIS GUY--
THIS GUY'S HIP.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.183
- WOULD YOU TAKE HIM OUT
FOR A BURGER OR SOMETHING?

06:43.330 --> 06:44.558
- YEAH.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.847
- YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.675
- I THINK--
I WANT HIM TO FEEL LIKE

06:48.820 --> 06:52.779
WE'RE ALL A FAMILY.

06:54.550 --> 06:56.120
- AND WE ARE.

06:56.270 --> 06:59.330
[both laughing]

06:59.480 --> 07:03.655
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S USED
FOR ANEURYSMS AND BLOOD CLOTS?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.415
I WONDER IF HE HAD, LIKE,
A HEART ATTACK

07:05.560 --> 07:06.834
AND DIDN'T TELL US.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.619
- OR HE JUST HASN'T HAD TIME
TO TALK TO YOU

07:08.770 --> 07:10.385
ABOUT WHY
HE'S TAKING IT.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.804
- WELL, I THINK
YOU'D FIND THE TIME

07:11.940 --> 07:13.692
TO TELL EVERYONE
YOU'VE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.705
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
HE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.319
IT'S JUST, HE COULD
BE TAKING IT FOR SOMETHING

07:17.470 --> 07:18.983
COMPLETELY MINOR,
LIKE--

07:19.120 --> 07:22.840
- NO, I BET IT'S THIS--
"ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME."

07:22.990 --> 07:25.083
THANE'S AN AUTO-IMMUNE
DISEASE.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.857
THAT COULD BE WORSE
THAN A HEART ATTACK.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.196
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS THE WORST THING.

07:28.340 --> 07:32.618
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER
GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.921
WIKIPEDIA BAD.

07:35.070 --> 07:36.719
- ALL RIGHT.
- TO RELAX.

07:36.870 --> 07:41.079
- IT WAS A LOT OF PILLS.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.909
[school bell rings]

07:46.050 --> 07:47.358
[horn honk]

07:47.500 --> 07:48.762
- DREW.
- OH, HEY.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.468
- YOU WANT A RIDE?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.704
- OH, NO, I'M FINE, THE BUS
STOPS, LIKE, RIGHT THERE, SO--

07:52.850 --> 07:55.318
- WELL, I MEAN, I'M GOING
TO THE SAME PLACE.

07:55.470 --> 07:57.392
- YEAH, I MEAN--
- COME ON.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.770
- YEAH, SURE.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.472
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.488
- SO HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

08:12.630 --> 08:14.586
- IT WAS FINE.

08:14.730 --> 08:17.449
- I KNOW, UH, MRS. GRISCOM
REALLY LIKES

08:17.600 --> 08:20.068
TO PILE ON THE HOMEWORK
THIS TIME OF YEAR, 50--

08:20.220 --> 08:24.702
- YEAH, SHE REALLY--
BIG PILE OF WORK.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.706
- WELL, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD, UH,

08:28.850 --> 08:32.399
YOU KNOW, GO OUT AND GET
A BURGER SOMETIME, YOU KNOW?

08:32.540 --> 08:35.816
JUST LIKE A CASUAL THING
JUST GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.545
- YEAH, YEAH, I FEEL LIKE
MY MOM TOLD YOU

08:40.690 --> 08:43.614
SPECIFICALLY TO ASK ME
TO GET A BURGER.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.749
- [laughs]
NO, NO, NO, I--SHE--

08:44.900 --> 08:47.789
YOUR MOM
DID NOT PUT ME UP TO THIS.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.864
THIS IS SOMETHING I WANTED
TO DO JUST TO SORT OF...

08:51.010 --> 08:53.729
GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER,
YOU KNOW? I BARELY--

08:53.870 --> 08:55.804
- YEAH, I GUESS.
I MEAN, SURE.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.692
- SOME BURGERS,
SOME MILKSHAKES.

08:57.840 --> 09:02.732
JUST TWO DUDES
EATING BURGERS, HANGING OUT.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.461
- YEAH, PRETTY CLASSIC
SCENARIO.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.078
- WELL, COOL,
ALL RIGHT.

09:07.230 --> 09:10.677
COOL.

09:10.820 --> 09:13.880
- OKAY,
HERE'S THE SURPRISE.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.782
MY FRIEND AT MY OLD FIRM
CALLED ME

09:15.930 --> 09:17.659
AND SHE NEEDS
A NEW PARALEGAL.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.064
AND I TOLD HER
ABOUT YOU--

09:19.210 --> 09:22.930
- I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT--

09:23.070 --> 09:24.514
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
A PARALEGAL DOES.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.696
I DON'T EVEN--I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAW.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.070
- I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
A SMART GIRL, TRUST ME.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.903
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN MOST
OF THE PARALEGALS I WORK WITH.

09:31.050 --> 09:32.563
YOU CAN PICK IT UP,
QUICK.

09:32.710 --> 09:33.972
- BUT DIDN'T THEY,
LIKE, GO TO SCHOOL

09:34.120 --> 09:35.394
AND THEY'RE ALL
GOING TO APPLY FOR THIS JOB?

09:35.540 --> 09:36.871
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.

09:37.020 --> 09:38.248
I MEAN, I KNOW
HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.630
- OKAY, I HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF PULL.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.122
- WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
CONNECTIONS?

09:42.270 --> 09:43.430
- SHE'S MY FRIEND,
I TALKED TO HER ABOUT YOU,

09:43.580 --> 09:44.649
AND HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE.

09:44.790 --> 09:45.779
- PRETTY GANGSTER
OF YOU.

09:45.930 --> 09:48.069
- SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

09:48.200 --> 09:50.782
SHE NEEDS THE APPLICATION
BY 6:00.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.659
I KNOW
YOU CAN DO THIS.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.758
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

09:54.900 --> 09:55.935
SALARY REQUIREMENTS?

09:56.070 --> 09:57.105
- OH, YOU CAN
LEAVE THAT BLANK.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.694
ACTUALLY, THE SALARY
IS SET AT 48.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.309
- 48 WHAT?

10:00.460 --> 10:02.667
- 48 GRAND.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.689
- HOLY BALLS,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:05.840 --> 10:08.707
FOR NO KNOW-HOW
OF HOW TO DO THIS JOB?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.808
- YOU CAN LEARN ON THE JOB,
LIKE I SAID.

10:10.950 --> 10:14.249
- ZOE, I KNOW
YOU CAN DO THIS.

10:16.890 --> 10:19.051
- HEY, GOOSE.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.713
- HEY, MOM.

10:20.860 --> 10:23.749
- IS THIS A LAUNDRY VISIT
OR A FOOD VISIT?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.232
- HEY, I COME OVER HERE
ALL THE TIME

10:25.380 --> 10:27.587
WHEN I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.
I RESENT THAT.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.618
- OH, IT'S TOO BAD,
BECAUSE THERE'S A CHEESECAKE

10:29.760 --> 10:30.966
IN THE FRIDGE.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.338
- UM, I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING
TO TALK TO DAD.

10:32.490 --> 10:34.105
IS HE AROUND?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.763
- JUST GIVE HIM
A GOOD SHAKE.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.663
HE'LL WAKE UP.

10:41.290 --> 10:43.463
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GOING TO LET HIM REST.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.568
UH, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
IF I TALK TO YOU ANYWAYS.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.052
- OH, YEAH,
WHAT'S UP?

10:47.190 --> 10:50.011
- WELL, I WENT TO PICK UP
MY ALLERGY MEDICATION

10:50.160 --> 10:52.196
AT THE PHARMACY,
AND THEY GAVE ME A BUNCH

10:52.340 --> 10:54.604
OF DAD'S PILLS
BY ACCIDENT.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.479
WARFARIN?

10:56.620 --> 11:00.021
I GOOGLED THAT.
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS MEDICATION.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.785
- YOUR DAD DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO WORRY.

11:01.930 --> 11:03.898
AND REALLY, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.758
IT'S PREVENTATIVE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.310
- WELL, BUT, FOR WHAT,
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:07.450 --> 11:10.339
- LOOK, GOOSE, I'D REALLY LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS,

11:10.490 --> 11:12.731
BUT DAD WAS VERY SPECIFIC
ABOUT MY NOT DISCUSSING

11:12.870 --> 11:14.428
HIS HEALTH
WITH YOU KIDS.

11:14.570 --> 11:15.798
YOU KNOW
HOW PRIVATE HE IS.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.770
- HE'S ON AN ERECTILE
DYSFUNCTION COMMERCIAL.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.662
I DON'T THINK HE CAN
CLAIM PRIVACY

11:19.810 --> 11:21.607
AS HIS NUMBER ONE
PRIORITY ANYMORE.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.297
MOM, YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.771
I'M NOT 13 YEARS OLD.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.330
I MEAN, IF I NEED
TO BE WORRIED,

11:26.470 --> 11:28.438
THEN TELL ME I NEED TO BE
WORRIED AND I'LL START HELPING--

11:28.580 --> 11:31.048
- IT'S JUST THAT YOUR DAD...

11:31.200 --> 11:34.613
WANTS TO APPEAR STRONG
TO YOU KIDS.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.819
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.
- MM-HMM.

11:36.970 --> 11:38.926
- AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE,

11:39.070 --> 11:42.130
YOU KNOW, WORRISOME,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:46.010 --> 11:48.069
- [clears throat]

11:52.260 --> 11:53.807
- LOOK, MAX, WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

11:53.950 --> 11:55.258
WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY--
BASKETBALL'S

11:55.400 --> 11:57.288
YOUR FAVORITE SPORT,
YOU LOVE PLAYING WITH ALEX.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.771
- I DON'T LIKE IT
THE WAY THEY PLAY IT.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.433
THERE ARE TOO MANY
KIDS ON THE TEAM.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.719
- WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
WHEN EVERYBODY'S OUT THERE

12:02.860 --> 12:04.578
ON THE COURT, BUT THAT CAN
ALSO MAKE IT REALLY FUN TOO.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.166
THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN TEAMWORK,
WORKING TOGETHER.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.754
- YOU KNOW, MICAH PROBABLY
HAS MORE FUN

12:08.900 --> 12:10.549
BECAUSE HE GETS TO PLAY
VIDEO GAMES DURING BASKETBALL.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.237
- WELL, YOU GET TO PLAY
PLENTY OF VIDEO GAMES.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.790
- BUT HE HAS THIS ONE WHERE
YOU'RE, LIKE, A KNIGHT AND--

12:13.940 --> 12:15.441
- WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

12:15.590 --> 12:16.579
- YOU GO AROUND SLAYING DRAGONS.
- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT--

12:16.730 --> 12:18.038
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
BASKETBALL RIGHT NOW.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.829
YOU GET TO PLAY
PLENTY OF VIDEO GAMES, OKAY?

12:19.980 --> 12:21.072
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I CAN'T PLAY,

12:21.220 --> 12:22.528
'CAUSE I HAVE
A DISABILITY.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.661
- OKAY, DO NOT USE THAT
AS AN EXCUSE.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.187
- MAX, HAVING ASPERGER'S MAKES
CERTAIN THINGS CHALLENGING,

12:27.330 --> 12:29.389
BUT WE KNOW FOR A FACT
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT LAY-UP, SO--

12:29.540 --> 12:30.984
- WELL, YEAH, I KNOW
I HAVE A GOOD LAY-UP

12:31.120 --> 12:32.849
AND I TELL
THE OTHER KIDS THAT,

12:32.990 --> 12:35.879
BUT THEY STILL DON'T
PASS ME THE BALL.

12:36.030 --> 12:37.816
- OH.
- OKAY, LOOK.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.052
MY P.E. TEACHER
SAYS THAT IF YOU

12:39.200 --> 12:40.758
WRITE HER A NOTE,
SHE'LL LET ME SKIP.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.233
IT'S PROBLEM SOLVED.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.859
- WELL, MAX, WE DON'T WANT
YOU TO SIT OUT.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.410
WE WANT YOU
TO FEEL INCLUDED AND--

12:46.550 --> 12:47.687
- YOU CAN PLAY BASKETBALL,
MAX, YOU CAN.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.343
- BUT IT'S THE EASIEST
SOLUTION.

12:49.490 --> 12:50.582
- IT'S NOT.

12:50.730 --> 12:52.834
- LOOK, IF I'M SO GOOD
AT BASKETBALL, THEN...

12:52.970 --> 12:57.316
THEN WHY DO I ALWAYS
GET PICKED LAST?

12:59.910 --> 13:02.777
[plastic clattering]

13:02.920 --> 13:05.809
- I DON'T KNOW, PAL.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.504
- ALL RIGHT, MAX, REMEMBER,
BASKETBALL IS ALL ABOUT

13:14.650 --> 13:16.379
WORKING TOGETHER,
SO I WANT YOU TO TRY

13:16.510 --> 13:18.751
AND PASS THE BALL TWO TIMES
BEFORE YOU TAKE A SHOT, OKAY?

13:18.900 --> 13:20.299
- DID YOU DO ANYTHING
THIS MORNING TO LIMBER UP?

13:20.450 --> 13:22.509
- YEAH, I LIMBERED UP.
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

13:22.660 --> 13:24.002
- TOOK A SHOWER.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.892
- NO, THAT DOESN'T COUNT
AS LIMBERING UP, DAD.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.314
- IT DOES AT MY AGE,
I'LL TELL YOU.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.973
- JUST PASS THAT BALL,
ALL RIGHT?

13:29.110 --> 13:30.213
REMEMBER, IF YOUR TEAMMATE
MAKES A BASKET, SAY,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.499
"GOOD SHOT," IF THEY MISS,
"NICE TRY."

13:32.630 --> 13:34.427
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE--
- YOU'RE A TEAM.

13:34.570 --> 13:35.730
YOU'RE A TEAM OF FRIENDS.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.700
- CAN WE JUST PLAY
BASKETBALL?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.078
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
- WAIT, WHAT ARE THE TEAMS?

13:39.230 --> 13:40.561
- I WANT MAX.
- I WANT MAX.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.120
- I THOUGHT WE'D DO
FATHER-SON, FATHER-SON.

13:42.260 --> 13:45.058
- UNCLE CROSBY, NO, HE'S
THE BEST AND YOU TWO ARE OLD.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.508
- THIS KID
IS WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.504
- ALL RIGHT, PASS,
PASS, PASS, READY?

13:48.650 --> 13:50.299
- THE GAUNTLET HAS BEEN THROWN,
SO TO SPEAK.

13:50.450 --> 13:51.781
- PASS IT TO UNCLE CROSBY.
GOOD PASS, ALL RIGHT.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.545
- HEY, DO ME A FAVOR,
ALL RIGHT AND PASS A LITTLE

13:53.690 --> 13:55.578
MORE THAN NORMAL, I'M TRYING
TO TEACH HIM ABOUT TEAMWORK.

13:55.730 --> 13:57.686
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
OH, AND KEEP AN EYE ON DAD.

13:57.830 --> 13:58.819
- WHY?
- DOES HIS COLORING

13:58.970 --> 14:00.414
LOOK A LITTLE
WEIRD TO YOU?

14:00.560 --> 14:01.697
- HEY, CAN WE JUST
GET GOING, PLEASE?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.171
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
WE GOT IT, YOU READY?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.309
ALL RIGHT.
- MAY WE START?

14:04.460 --> 14:05.734
- ALL RIGHT,
BALL IN, BALL IN.

14:05.870 --> 14:08.145
- OOH, CHATTY.
- OH!

14:08.290 --> 14:10.520
ALL RIGHT, MAX, PASS IT OFF,
PASS IT BACK TO CROSBY.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.774
- I'M OPEN, PASS IT BACK.
- PASS IT TO UNCLE CROSBY.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.013
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- PASS IT BACK--

14:15.160 --> 14:17.390
ALL RIGHT, GOOD SHOT, MAX.
- FLAGRANT FOUL.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.155
- WHENEVER I PASS,
I NEVER GET THE BALL BACK.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.813
- NOW, MAX, I'M GOING TO PASS
TO YOU, CHECK IT WITH ME.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.188
COME ON, COME HERE.
- NO, I DON'T GET

14:22.340 --> 14:23.716
THE BALL BACK
WHEN I PASS.

14:23.860 --> 14:27.159
- AH, JEEZ.

14:27.310 --> 14:29.722
- THE OLD GIVE AND GO.
- WHOA!

14:29.860 --> 14:31.031
- PASSING SUCKS.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.444
- PUT IT UP, POP, PUT IT UP!

14:33.590 --> 14:36.241
- YEAH!
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.

14:36.390 --> 14:38.620
- ALL RIGHT, POP, GO,
RUN IT, RUN IT.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.739
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
COME ON.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.563
ALL RIGHT.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:43.710 --> 14:46.565
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
JEEZ, I'M FINE, LET'S GO.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.291
LET'S GO!

14:50.750 --> 14:53.469
- YOU GOT IT, POP.

14:53.610 --> 14:55.669
GOOD ONE, POP, NICE.
- YOU GOOD?

14:55.820 --> 14:57.162
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:57.310 --> 14:59.642
- GO WITH IT.
- YEAH.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.371
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HEY,

15:01.520 --> 15:03.374
LET'S TAKE, LIKE,
A FIVE-MINUTE WATER BREAK.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.966
- YEAH, OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.
YEAH, I'M PRETTY THIRSTY.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.271
- DAD, WATER.
- HUH?

15:08.420 --> 15:11.344
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
COME ON, SHOOT, OKAY, READY?

15:11.490 --> 15:13.458
- DAD.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.080
- WHEW!

15:29.650 --> 15:30.719
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:30.860 --> 15:32.361
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

15:32.510 --> 15:35.092
JUST CAN'T GET MORE--
MY BREATH.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.923
- YOU'RE OUT OF BREATH?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.538
- [breathing hard]

15:39.690 --> 15:41.339
I JUST WANT TO CATCH
MY BREATH.

15:41.490 --> 15:44.379
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
HAVING A LITTLE CONVERSATION.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.556
- WELL, I'M JUST--
DO I NEED TO CALL A DOCTOR?

15:46.700 --> 15:47.598
IS ALL I'M ASKING.
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,

15:47.730 --> 15:49.664
"CALL A DOCTOR."
- I'M BEING SERIOUS.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.664
- I'M JUST OUT OF BREATH,
CROSBY, WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?

15:51.810 --> 15:53.186
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:53.330 --> 15:54.729
- NOTHING'S GOING ON.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.700
- OKAY, I WENT TO THE PHARMACY
TO GET MY PRESCRIPTION,

15:56.850 --> 15:58.738
AND THEY GAVE ME FOUR OF YOURS.
- OH, COME ON.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.120
- ALL RIGHT, SO I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE TAKING

16:00.260 --> 16:01.773
A BUNCH OF PILLS,
AND THEN I ASKED MOM

16:01.920 --> 16:04.127
AND SHE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING,
BUT CLEARLY SHE'S SCARED.

16:04.270 --> 16:05.714
- YEAH, WELL, YOUR MOTHER,
ALL SHE DOES IS WORRY.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.612
ALL RIGHT, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.024
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE--
YOU KNOW, CROSBY,

16:09.170 --> 16:10.444
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE,
WILL YOU?

16:10.590 --> 16:11.716
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TELL ADAM, ALL RIGHT?

16:11.860 --> 16:13.100
GOD ALMIGHTY.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.650
- YOU HAVE NOTHING GOING ON?
- NOTHING.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.415
- THEY PRESCRIBED
YOU PILLS FOR NOTHING?

16:16.560 --> 16:18.960
- OH, COME ON.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.762
- [whistles]

16:22.910 --> 16:24.138
- CUTE.
- COOL, RIGHT?

16:24.290 --> 16:25.689
- MM-HMM.
- THANK YOU.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.728
- VERY RIHANNA.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.348
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A RINGING ENDORSEMENT.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.128
- SUPER WORK-APPROPRIATE.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.500
- THAT'S FUNNY.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.198
IT'S REALLY
NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.228
I JUST WANT
TO LOOK NICE.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.019
TRY TO GET ME
TO A FORMAL OCCASION.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.501
THIS IS WHAT I'VE GOT.

16:41.650 --> 16:43.402
- YOU CAN'T AVOID
BEING SUPER SEXY.

16:43.550 --> 16:46.587
- THAT'S FUNNY, CAN'T HELP IT.
- NO.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.062
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M
GOING TO WEAR THESE OR NOT YET.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.416
I JUST AM BRINGING
A BUNCH OF STUFF.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.791
- MM-HMM.
EITHER THESE OR THESE.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.032
- OR OTHERS.
- FOR WHAT?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.408
ARE YOU GUYS--
IS THERE, LIKE,

16:55.560 --> 16:58.120
A BUNCH OF YOU CLUBBING
AFTERWARDS OR SOMETHING?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.729
- NO.
- WHO ARE YOU DRESSING FOR?

16:59.880 --> 17:01.734
BUNCH OF SEXY INTERNS?
- BUNCH OF WORK PEOPLE.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.635
NO, NO SEXY INTERNS THIS TIME.
JUST--JUST ME AND BOB.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.600
- JUST YOU AND BOB?
- YEAH.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.571
I MEAN, I'M HIS ASSISTANT
SO, YOU KNOW,

17:11.720 --> 17:13.745
I GOT TO ASSIST HIM.

17:13.890 --> 17:16.029
- MM-HMM.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.024
WHEW!

17:18.170 --> 17:21.344
HE'S CUTE, RIGHT?

17:21.480 --> 17:23.994
HE'S, LIKE, YOUNG TOO.

17:24.140 --> 17:28.622
DO YOU WANT TO, LIKE,
HOOK UP WITH HIM?

17:28.770 --> 17:31.762
- HADDIE, WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN SAY THAT?

17:31.910 --> 17:34.003
- I DON'T KNOW, IT COULD BE--
- OF COURSE NOT, PLEASE DON'T.

17:34.150 --> 17:35.663
- HE'S YOUNG.
HE'S AT LEAST YOUNG.

17:35.810 --> 17:38.040
- HADDIE, IT'S NOT FUNNY,
YOU KNOW, HE'S MY BOSS.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.569
SO PLEASE, YOU KNOW, DON'T GO
MAKING THOSE KINDS OF JOKES

17:41.710 --> 17:43.564
TO YOUR, LIKE,
MOM AND STUFF.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.122
JUST FORGET THAT COMPLETELY,
OKAY?

17:46.270 --> 17:48.670
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH,
FORGOTTEN.

17:48.820 --> 17:52.449
- JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:58.350 --> 18:00.443
- HEY, MAX, COULD YOU
TURN THAT OFF PLEASE?

18:00.590 --> 18:02.729
I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR ONE MINUTE.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.246
- CAN I HAVE ONE MORE LEVEL?

18:04.390 --> 18:07.427
I WANT YOU TO JUST
PAUSE IT FOR A SECOND.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.425
- IT'S PAUSED.
- THANK YOU.

18:09.570 --> 18:11.322
DID YOU HAVE FUN PLAYING
BASKETBALL WITH UNCLE CROSBY

18:11.460 --> 18:13.041
AND GRANDPA ZEEK TODAY?

18:13.190 --> 18:14.634
- YEAH.
- GOOD, WELL, YOU WERE

18:14.780 --> 18:16.429
REALLY GREAT AT THE PASSING
WHEN YOU WERE FOCUSED.

18:16.570 --> 18:17.673
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT

18:17.820 --> 18:19.606
WHEN YOU GO TO
P.E. CLASS TOMORROW.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.058
- PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME PLAY.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.918
- MAX, I JUST WANT YOU TO TRY,
THAT'S ALL, JUST TRY.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.618
YOUR MOTHER AND I WANT
TO SEE YOU HAVE FUN

18:24.750 --> 18:26.547
PLAYING BASKETBALL AGAIN.
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.134
- WELL, I CAN'T HAVE FUN IF
I'M PLAYING WITH THOSE LOSERS.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.714
- ALL RIGHT, MAX, WE DON'T
CALL OTHER KIDS LOSERS, OKAY?

18:29.860 --> 18:32.101
- WHY NOT?
THEY CALL ME A LOSER.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.935
- WHO CALLS YOU A LOSER?

18:34.070 --> 18:37.073
- GABRIEL, MICHAEL, RAPHAEL,
VICTOR, CARLOS, LOUISE--

18:37.210 --> 18:40.282
- ALL RIGHT, MAX, LISTEN TO ME,
YOU'RE NOT A LOSER.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.864
- GABE, GAVIN, JESSICA...
- OKAY? YOU'RE AWESOME.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.830
YOU'RE AN AMAZING KID WITH
A SUPER JUMP SHOT, ALL RIGHT?

18:43.980 --> 18:47.040
HEY, MAX...

18:47.190 --> 18:49.010
YOU'RE NOT A LOSER,
ALL RIGHT?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.299
THOSE KIDS ARE LOSERS.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.748
- BUT, WAIT, YOU JUST
SAID IT'S NOT OKAY

18:52.890 --> 18:54.539
TO CALL SOMEONE A LOSER.
- YEAH, I KNOW I DID, MAX.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.647
- FIRST YOU SAID IT'S NOT
OKAY TO CALL PEOPLE LOSERS,

18:55.780 --> 18:57.099
AND NOW YOU'RE CALLING
THEM LOSERS.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.504
- I KNOW, I'M SORRY, MAX,
SORRY.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.163
- SO SINCE THEY ARE LOSERS,
I SHOULDN'T--

19:00.310 --> 19:03.996
IT'S NOT FUN TO PLAY WITH THEM,
SO JUST LET ME SKIP FOR ONE DAY.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.689
ONE DAY.

19:07.830 --> 19:10.390
- OKAY, PAL,
JUST ONE DAY.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.839
- ONE DAY.
- OKAY?

19:11.970 --> 19:13.904
- ONE DAY.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.702
- I KNOW. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.979
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED
THOSE KIDS LOSERS.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.701
- I KNOW.
- THEY'RE NOT LOSERS.

19:24.850 --> 19:26.294
- I KNOW.

19:26.440 --> 19:30.433
- THEY'RE JACKASSES.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.690
- IT TOOK THREE CHAPTERS,

19:37.830 --> 19:43.621
BUT THAT TYRANT
FINALLY WENT DOWN.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.899
WHAT IS IT?

19:46.040 --> 19:50.147
- MIA JUST CALLED, AND ZOE
NEVER TURNED IN HER APPLICATION.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.589
- OH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.423
- NOPE, THEY GAVE HER
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.777
THEY WAITED TILL 7:45.
- HON, I'M SO SORRY.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.435
I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR HEART
SET ON HER GETTING THAT JOB.

20:01.570 --> 20:03.709
- I WANTED THIS FOR HER,
I DID, BUT, I MEAN,

20:03.850 --> 20:05.192
THEY HAD TO GO WITH
SOMEBODY ELSE, OBVIOUSLY.

20:05.340 --> 20:06.432
- RIGHT.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.093
- BUT IT WAS HERS
FOR THE TAKING.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.379
IT WAS PERFECT FOR HER.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.899
ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS SEND IT IN.

20:13.030 --> 20:14.998
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND--
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

20:15.140 --> 20:17.654
- I KNOW, HONEY,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.964
THIS BABY'S COMING SOON,
OKAY, AND...

20:25.050 --> 20:28.838
EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO CUT TIES WITH ZOE.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.847
YOU KNOW?
- YEAH.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.424
I DO--I DO KNOW THAT.

20:33.570 --> 20:34.912
BUT I'M TRYING TO SET
HER UP FOR THAT POINT,

20:35.060 --> 20:36.675
INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING HER
TO THE WOLVES WHEN--

20:36.820 --> 20:38.811
- WELL, HONEY, IT COMES
TO A POINT WHERE, I MEAN,

20:38.960 --> 20:41.713
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.784
- MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO FEEL INDEBTED TO US.

20:44.930 --> 20:46.784
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
IF SHE'S CHANGING HER MIND

20:46.930 --> 20:48.682
ABOUT THE BABY, THAT'S--
THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.889
- HONEY,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.655
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THIS ROAD
EVERY SINGLE TIME

20:52.800 --> 20:55.621
ZOE CHANGES HER MIND,
OKAY?

20:55.770 --> 20:58.591
AND...YOU JUST HAVE
TO BE PREPARED

20:58.740 --> 21:01.868
FOR WHATEVER DECISION
SHE MAKES.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.137
- NO, YOU CAN'T PUT THAT THERE.
YOU'LL MISS THE ZOMBIE.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.727
- OH, OKAY.

21:31.870 --> 21:33.792
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE

21:33.940 --> 21:35.589
WHEN THEY'RE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.833
I'M VERY SORRY, MICAH.

21:37.980 --> 21:43.532
- IT'S OKAY.
I WAS GOING TO MISS THE ZOMBIE.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.636
- DO YOU WANT
TO TRY MINE?

21:45.780 --> 21:50.331
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MY FAVORITE
GAME IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.266
- HERE, LET'S TRADE.

21:52.410 --> 21:55.857
- OKAY, PRESS DOWN AND THEN "A"
IF YOU WANT TO START A NEW GAME.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.275
- OKAY, PRESS START
AND THEN "A" IF YOU WANT--

21:58.420 --> 22:02.447
- YEAH, YEAH,
I'VE PLAYED IT BEFORE.

22:02.590 --> 22:06.287
- SO MUCH LOVE,
THE KIDS ARE LAUGHING...

22:06.420 --> 22:07.933
- I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY
AND SAY SOMETHING FUNNY NOW,

22:08.080 --> 22:10.696
BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW TO DO THAT.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.320
- IT'S OKAY. I DON'T LIKE
TO JOKE THAT MUCH.

22:13.470 --> 22:14.869
- ME EITHER.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.841
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
KIND OF A SERIOUS KID.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.743
- I LIKE BEING
SERIOUS TOO.

22:20.890 --> 22:22.710
- COOL.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.434
- COOL.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.571
- EVERY LITTLE
GIRL AND BOY

22:28.720 --> 22:30.642
EVEN BETTER
WHEN THEY WAKE UP

22:30.790 --> 22:32.678
TOMORROW

22:32.830 --> 22:33.990
- IT'S BEEN SUCH AN HONOR
TO TALK

22:34.140 --> 22:36.552
AND TO MEET SO MANY OF YOU
ALL THIS EVENING.

22:36.700 --> 22:40.033
SMALL BUSINESS IS THE HEART
AND SOUL OF OUR ECONOMY.

22:40.180 --> 22:42.171
SO THIS ROOM, MORE THAN
ANY OTHER ROOM IN THE STATE,

22:42.320 --> 22:44.766
REPRESENTS OUR POTENTIAL
FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

22:44.910 --> 22:46.730
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
FOR COMING OUT THIS EVENING.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.041
IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

22:52.710 --> 22:54.325
THANKS SO MUCH.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.290
- BOB.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.533
- FUENTES.
- MR. FUENTES.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.749
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.

22:59.890 --> 23:01.198
YES, HOW IS
THE ALMOND FARM GOING?

23:01.340 --> 23:05.686
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.798
- HEY, WAIT, WAIT WAIT.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.579
I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU
SOME CASH, YOU KNOW?

23:09.730 --> 23:11.550
IN CASE HE TRIES TO STIFF YOU
WITH THE BILL.

23:11.700 --> 23:12.826
- THANK YOU, YEAH.

23:12.970 --> 23:14.483
- SO, WHERE ARE
YOU GUYS GOING?

23:14.630 --> 23:15.699
- I DON'T KNOW,
WE'LL SEE, I GUESS.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.171
- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO TALK ABOUT?

23:17.320 --> 23:18.662
ME? YOU'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT ME?

23:18.810 --> 23:20.357
- YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK ABOUT YOU.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.706
- OKAY, BOOKS,
OR BASEBALL GUY STUFF.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.216
- BOOKS AND YOU.
- GIVE HIM A CHANCE, OKAY?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.294
DON'T--

23:25.430 --> 23:28.081
- AND THEN WE SEE

23:28.230 --> 23:32.815
THESE MOMENTS
ARE THE ONLY GIFTS WE NEED

23:36.510 --> 23:38.683
- OH, SIT, SIT, SIT.
NO, I GOT IT.

23:38.830 --> 23:42.823
POP THIS STUFF
IN THE FRIDGE.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.072
- SO, UH...

23:48.210 --> 23:51.555
I MEANT TO SAY THAN KS
FOR RECOMMENDING ME

23:51.700 --> 23:55.636
FOR THAT JOB,
BUT I DECIDED NOT TO TAKE IT.

23:55.770 --> 23:58.113
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

23:58.260 --> 24:01.673
- WHY NOT?

24:01.810 --> 24:05.120
- JUST WASN'T FOR ME,
YOU KNOW?

24:05.270 --> 24:08.125
BESIDES, I DON'T REALLY
THINK IT'S MY THING

24:08.270 --> 24:10.682
TO WEAR NYLONS EVERY DAY.

24:10.820 --> 24:14.859
- RIGHT.
- NOT MY STYLE, YOU KNOW?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.968
BUT I JUST--I DON'T
WANT YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.930
I MEAN,
IT WAS SUPER NICE OF YOU,

24:19.070 --> 24:20.822
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.313
SO THANKS FOR STICKING
YOUR NECK OUT.

24:23.460 --> 24:28.420
- IT'S FINE.
- OKAY.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.185
- OKAY, ZOE,
IT'S NOT FINE.

24:30.330 --> 24:32.048
ACTUALLY I AM DISAPPOINTED.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:32.190 --> 24:34.249
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE THAT JOB.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.631
- I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--
IT'S NOT FOR ME, SO--

24:37.780 --> 24:38.701
- LOOK AROUND HERE.

24:38.850 --> 24:41.717
YOU CAN
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

24:41.850 --> 24:44.478
- YOU HAVE TO DO IT, THOUGH.
- ABOUT WHAT?

24:44.620 --> 24:47.646
- ABOUT YOUR SITUATION,
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.997
- MY SITUATION?
- YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.791
YEAH, IT'S POSSIBLE
TO CHANGE THINGS.

24:52.930 --> 24:54.409
- NOTHING ABOUT MY SITUATION...
- IT'S PRETTY EASY...

24:54.560 --> 24:57.688
- IF YOU STOP RESISTING.
- IS HURTING YOUR BABY, OKAY?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.660
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT--

24:59.800 --> 25:01.449
- I'M EATING RIGHT,
I'M RESTING,

25:01.600 --> 25:03.215
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.703
- ZOE, YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S
NOT ALL THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.182
_ 50--
- YOU HAVE TO KNOW

25:07.330 --> 25:08.809
THAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MORE THAN THAT BY NOW.

25:08.950 --> 25:10.633
- I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

25:10.780 --> 25:11.849
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT THE BABY'S
GOING TO COME OUT DUMB LIKE ME.

25:11.990 --> 25:13.298
- I'M NOT--
OH, MY GOD.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.953
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.024
- YOU'RE NOT DUMB, BUT WOULD
YOU STOP ACTING LIKE IT?

25:17.170 --> 25:18.649
THIS WAS EASY.
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

25:18.790 --> 25:20.166
- THIS JOB HAD YOUR NAME
ON IT, WAITING FOR YOU.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.709
- HOW DARE YOU SAY
IT'S THAT EASY?

25:21.860 --> 25:23.236
HOW DARE YOU?

25:23.380 --> 25:24.779
- I ARRANGED IT.
IT WAS SETUP FOR YOU.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.204
- YOU "ARRANGED IT"?
YOU THINK CAN JUST

25:26.350 --> 25:28.170
COME IN HERE AND ARRANGE
EVERYTHING FROM MY LIFE, RIGHT?

25:28.310 --> 25:30.790
YOU BUY SOME
ORGANIC CRAP GROCERIES,

25:30.940 --> 25:33.079
AND YOU BRING IT IN
AND YOU FIX EVERYTHING.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.075
SO, WHEN YOU LEAVE, EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE FINE, RIGHT?

25:36.220 --> 25:39.041
WELL, GUESS WHAT, I DON'T
EVEN HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

25:39.190 --> 25:41.420
IT SAYS, RIGHT THERE
ON THE APPLICATION,

25:41.570 --> 25:43.049
"HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
REQUIRED."

25:43.190 --> 25:45.750
SO HOW EASY ARE THINGS
LOOKING NOW?

25:59.730 --> 26:03.279
- MAMA?
- MM-HMM?

26:03.420 --> 26:06.207
- UM...NEVER MIND.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.147
- HONEY, I'M UP.
I'M JUST RESTING MY EYES.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.281
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:10.430 --> 26:13.877
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M JUST
FREAKING OUT ABOUT NOTHING.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.703
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT BOB LITTLE?

26:15.850 --> 26:18.569
LIKE, DO YOU THINK
HE'S A GOOD PERSON?

26:18.710 --> 26:20.086
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

26:20.230 --> 26:21.709
- YEAH, HADDIE,
I WORK FOR THE MAN.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.363
OF COURSE I THINK
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

26:23.510 --> 26:25.910
I MEAN, I THINK HE'S A GREAT
POLITICIAN AND HE'S JUST--

26:26.060 --> 26:28.233
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

26:33.760 --> 26:38.379
BUT, AMBER, I JUST DON'T WANT
HER TO MAKE ANY BAD DECISIONS.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.000
AND MAYBE SHE WOULD LISTEN
TO YOU IF SHE'S DOING ANYTHING.

26:41.150 --> 26:42.697

ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

26:42.840 --> 26:44.239
I JUST--WE WENT
FROM THERE TO THERE.

26:44.390 --> 26:45.903

26:46.050 --> 26:52.706
AND SHE WAS BRINGING, LIKE,
PRETTY SEXY CLOTHES.

26:52.850 --> 26:55.842
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:55.990 --> 26:57.298
NEVER MIND.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.714

27:47.800 --> 27:48.937
[cell phone rings]

27:49.080 --> 27:51.071

28:45.620 --> 28:49.238
- SO, UM,
I GET THE SENSE

28:49.380 --> 28:51.689
THAT SMALL TALK
ISN'T YOUR FAVORITE THING.

28:51.830 --> 28:55.209
- YEAH.
- UM...[clears throat]

28:55.350 --> 28:58.626
SO, UH, I KNOW
THAT YOUR MOM TALKED TO YOU

28:58.770 --> 29:02.558
ABOUT US HAVING A BABY.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.691
- YEAH.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.831
- AND, UM,

29:06.980 --> 29:11.041
I KNOW THAT'S
A...QUITE A BIG THING TO--

29:11.190 --> 29:14.193
- YEAH, IT'S--I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN, WE TALKED ABOUT IT

29:14.330 --> 29:17.788
ALREADY, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.571
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
A LITTLE WEIRD.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.709
I'M SORRY.
- OKAY. NO.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.168
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SORRY.

29:23.310 --> 29:25.232
BUT I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME ALL THOSE THINGS,

29:25.380 --> 29:26.893
THAT IT MAKES YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.723
I WANT YOU TO BE
DIRECT WITH ME.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.963
I'M GONNA BE IN YOUR LIFE.
- YEAH.

29:31.110 --> 29:33.169
- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.788
AND IT CAN BE A BAD RELATIONSHIP
OR NO RELATIONSHIP,

29:35.940 --> 29:37.737
BUT I HOPE
IT'S NEITHER OF THOSE.

29:37.870 --> 29:39.735
SO I WANT US TO BE ABLE
TO BE DIRECT WITH EACH OTHER

29:39.880 --> 29:42.110
AND TELL EACH OTHER
WHAT'S GOING ON.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.284
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
I JUST GET ONE-WORD ANSWERS

29:43.430 --> 29:44.806
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.019
- I'M SORRY.
- AND THEN I SECOND-GUESS

29:46.160 --> 29:47.491
EVERYTHING--
NOT FOR YOU TO APOLOGIZE.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.369
- IT'S JUST A WEIRD SITUATION.
- SO TELL ME ABOUT IT.

29:49.510 --> 29:50.886
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

29:51.030 --> 29:52.019
IT'S JUST UNCOMFORTABLE.
- I DO UNDERSTAND

29:52.160 --> 29:54.469
THAT IT'S WEIRD,
BUT I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

29:54.620 --> 29:56.542
EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

29:56.690 --> 29:58.134
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL ME YOU HATE ME,

29:58.270 --> 29:59.749
TELL ME, I'M A, YOU KNOW--
- I DON'T HATE YOU.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.039
THAT'S NOT IT.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

30:02.170 --> 30:03.990
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYONE PRETENDS, LIKE,

30:04.140 --> 30:06.108
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
WHEN IT IS.

30:06.250 --> 30:10.380
YOU KNOW, IT'S A HUGE--
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

30:10.530 --> 30:12.839
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
FEEL WEIRD, YOU KNOW,

30:12.980 --> 30:14.766
AND I HAVE TO SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL,

30:14.910 --> 30:18.084
AND YOU'RE SIGNIFICANTLY
YOUNGER THAN HER.

30:18.230 --> 30:21.631
AND IT'S JUST, ALL OF IT,
AS A WHOLE, I'M SORRY.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.056
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE, IT HURTS, YOU KNOW.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.407
IT FEELS LIKE SHE'S JUST
GOING TO GO OFF

30:27.540 --> 30:30.122
AND START SOME NEW FAMILY
WITH YOU OR SOMETHING.

30:30.270 --> 30:32.921
YOU KNOW,
AND IT HURTS.

30:34.830 --> 30:37.617
- OKAY, DREW, I--

30:37.760 --> 30:39.864
SHE'S NOT TRYING TO START
A NEW FAMILY, ALL RIGHT?

30:40.010 --> 30:44.037
- THAT'S WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE, SO--

30:50.080 --> 30:52.048
- DREW.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.635
DREW--

31:02.820 --> 31:04.367
DREW.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.543
- ALL RIGHT, WELL--

31:10.690 --> 31:12.134
- THANKS.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.895
- THANKS FOR DOING THAT.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.622
- HEY.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.666

31:22.810 --> 31:24.766

31:24.910 --> 31:26.639
- OH, NO,

31:26.780 --> 31:30.910
- UH...
UH, WELL...

31:31.060 --> 31:33.392
I GOT HIM TO OPEN UP.

31:33.540 --> 31:40.093
UM, AND HE TOLD ME
HOW HE REALLY FEELS.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.925
YEAH, IT WAS--
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

31:44.590 --> 31:48.754
- UM, I THINK MAYBE YOU
SHOULD JUST TALK TO HIM OR--

31:48.900 --> 31:51.767
ABOIUT IT.

31:51.910 --> 31:56.119
I GUESS I'M NOT THE TEENAGER
WHISPERER THAT I THOUGHT I WAS.

31:57.910 --> 32:02.700
BUT, UM, HE'S A REALLY
INCREDIBLE KID, THOUGH.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.020
[knock at door]

32:15.450 --> 32:17.372
- HI, LIZ, UM,

32:17.520 --> 32:19.067
FOR COMING BACK RIGHT NOW,
BUT I--

32:19.210 --> 32:21.235
- JULIA, SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

32:21.380 --> 32:24.827
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

32:24.970 --> 32:28.690
- I'M GOING, BUT COULD YOU JUST
MAKE SURE THAT SHE GETS THESE?

32:28.840 --> 32:30.114
PLEASE.
- WHAT?

32:30.250 --> 32:32.457
- OH.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.568
THAN KS. SORRY.

32:34.710 --> 32:35.734
WHAT?

32:37.850 --> 32:39.670
- G.E.D. FLASH CARDS.

32:39.810 --> 32:42.950
UM, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT ME
IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW,

32:43.090 --> 32:46.571
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT, SO...

32:46.720 --> 32:49.188
CALL ME
IF YOU WANT TO PRACTICE.

32:49.340 --> 32:52.025
I'M REALLY GOOD
AT THAT KIND OF THING.

32:55.070 --> 32:57.959
OKAY.

33:27.760 --> 33:31.651
[knock at door]

33:33.800 --> 33:35.768
- OKAY.

33:35.910 --> 33:38.697

33:43.220 --> 33:45.734

IN SACRAMENTO?

33:47.500 --> 33:48.808
- AMBER?

33:48.950 --> 33:52.056
- HI, AUNT KRISTINA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.987
IT'S PRETTY LATE.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:55.130 --> 33:56.643
- UM, WHAT IS GOING
ON RIGHT NOW?

33:56.790 --> 33:58.371
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS LOOKS?

33:58.510 --> 34:00.023
- AUNT KRISTINA,
CAN YOU CALM DOWN?

34:00.170 --> 34:01.478
- IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD.
- KRISTINA, JUST A MOMENT,

34:01.620 --> 34:03.349
WE'RE TWO ADULTS HERE
WHO HAD A NICE,

34:03.480 --> 34:04.378
LONG, HARD DAY AT WORK,
AND NOW WE'RE HAVING A DRINK.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.828
- UH-HUH, SHE'S 19,
YOU'RE 28.

34:05.970 --> 34:07.130
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAMPAIGN

34:07.280 --> 34:08.554
AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER,
DO YOU GET THAT?

34:08.700 --> 34:09.792
- IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
IF THIS DOESN'T--

34:09.940 --> 34:11.453
- BOBBY, SHUT UP.
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.589
- EXCUSE ME, JUST BEFORE THIS
WHOLE THING SPIRALS--

34:12.740 --> 34:14.423
- YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY LEAVE.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.141
- IT IS NOT A BIG DEAL,
AUNT KRISTINA, I'M AN ADULT.

34:16.290 --> 34:17.871
- PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME.
JUST GET OUT.

34:18.020 --> 34:20.011
WE'LL TALK IN THE CAR.
- I WILL DEAL WITH IT, OKAY?

34:20.160 --> 34:21.559
- I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD
AND PACK UP YOUR LINGERIE.

34:21.710 --> 34:23.291
I'M TRYING TO REMAIN
CALM RIGHT NOW.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.748
- I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
- I'M TRYING TO REMAIN CALM.

34:24.890 --> 34:27.199
- I WILL EXPLAIN THE WHOLE
THING TO YOU. WE HAVE--

34:27.340 --> 34:31.128
- AMBER, I'M EXTREMELY
DISAPPOINTED RIGHT NOW.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.647
THIS IS MY FAULT.
GO GET DRESSED. GO.

34:34.790 --> 34:35.711
[sniffles]

34:35.860 --> 34:37.657
COME ON, I HAVE
TO GET HOME TO NORA.

34:37.790 --> 34:40.270
[zippers squealing]

34:43.800 --> 34:45.688
IT'S JUST--

34:48.560 --> 34:50.733
- HEY.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.563
HEY, I WAS JUST COMING
TO TALK TO YOU.

34:52.710 --> 34:54.393
- I'M GOING TO GO
TO AMY'S SO--

34:54.540 --> 34:56.041
- NO, HONEY,
HEY, HEY.

34:56.190 --> 34:57.361
- WHAT?

34:57.500 --> 34:58.910
- IT'S TOO LATE
TO GO TO AMY'S TONIGHT.

34:59.060 --> 35:01.153
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT'S 10:00.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.916
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

35:04.060 --> 35:06.688
- NOTHING. I KNOW
HE TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED--

35:06.820 --> 35:08.788
- HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
HE SAID YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

35:08.930 --> 35:10.136
- [sighs]

35:10.280 --> 35:13.101
MOM, NOTHING,
I MEAN--

35:13.240 --> 35:14.650
- DID YOU GUYS--

35:14.800 --> 35:16.552
- I CRIED IN FRONT OF HIM,
ALL RIGHT, I CRIED.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.589
SO IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING.

35:19.730 --> 35:21.618
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

35:21.770 --> 35:23.829
CAN I JUST AT LEAST
GO OUTSIDE OR SOMETHING?

35:23.980 --> 35:28.019
- WHY DID YOU CRY, DREW?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.946
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:30.090 --> 35:33.127
IT'S JUST A WEIRD SITUATION,
AND HE KEPT PUSHING ME.

35:33.260 --> 35:36.889
AND HE'S TRYING TO BE CLOSE
TO ME, AND IT'S JUST NOT--

35:37.030 --> 35:38.713
I DON'T KNOW.

35:38.860 --> 35:39.929
I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

35:40.060 --> 35:41.573
HAVE YOU
EVEN TOLD DAD ABOUT THIS?

35:41.720 --> 35:43.779
I MEAN--

35:43.930 --> 35:46.205
- NO, I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYBODY, YOU--

35:46.350 --> 35:49.513
BUT--BUT I WILL.
- I JUST--

35:49.660 --> 35:52.003
- WHY--WHY DAD?
- I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE

35:52.150 --> 35:53.629
WHEN DAD GOT BETTER,

35:53.770 --> 35:57.422
YOU GUYS WOULD
GET TOGETHER OR SOMETHING.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.187
AND I KNOW
IT'S STUPID, BUT--

35:59.320 --> 36:01.663
- IT'S NOT STUPID.

36:03.710 --> 36:07.840
- CAN I JUST
GO OUTSIDE?

36:16.650 --> 36:21.474
[game plays in background]

36:21.620 --> 36:24.862
- HEY.
- HEY.

36:27.870 --> 36:31.522
- I'VE DECIDED TO LET YOU
BE A BABY ABOUT THIS

36:31.670 --> 36:34.696
AND KEEP ALL THIS
TO YOURSELF.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.879
I'M NOT GOING TO BUG YOU ANYMORE
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

36:39.020 --> 36:45.573
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING
INTO YOUR BUSINESS.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.812
- THAT IT?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.269
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

36:49.410 --> 36:51.059
- OKAY.

36:54.830 --> 36:59.722
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL,
SON.

36:59.870 --> 37:02.725
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR
FOR A CHECKUP.

37:02.870 --> 37:06.351
AND HE SAYS,
"MR. BRAVERMAN, YOU HAVE

37:06.500 --> 37:09.526
"THIS CONDITION CALLED
'ATRIAL FIBRILLATION."'

IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.532
AND, UH, CROSBY,
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

37:16.680 --> 37:18.261
IT JUST SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.607
YOU KNOW?

37:20.750 --> 37:23.674
AND I DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO KNOW.

37:23.820 --> 37:27.995
THAT'S ALL, SO...

37:28.140 --> 37:31.758
- WELL, IT SCARED ME TOO.

37:31.900 --> 37:37.623
YOU KNOW, I SAW
ALL THOSE PILLS AND, UM,

37:37.770 --> 37:40.238
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF YOU GETTING OLDER.

37:40.390 --> 37:42.210
I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.941
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO ANYWHERE.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.832
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

37:45.980 --> 37:48.983
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.815
THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.293
OKAY.
- I LOVE YOU, CROSBY.

38:00.620 --> 38:03.020
- NOW, DID THE DOCTOR SAY
THAT THIS WAS LIKE

38:03.170 --> 38:04.819
A HEREDITARY CONDITION?

38:04.970 --> 38:07.131
BECAUSE YOU AND I SHARE
A VERY SIMILAR FRAME.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.759
[both chuckling]

38:08.900 --> 38:10.629
- YOU GOT IT?

38:10.770 --> 38:12.340
- I THINK IT'S "ADRIl-T".
- IT'S NOT.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.764
- IT'S "ADRIl-T".
- NO, "DRAl-TY".

38:13.910 --> 38:15.628
IT'S NOT "DRAl-TY".
- IT'S "DRAl-TY".

38:15.770 --> 38:16.998
HEY, MAX, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT SHOOTING

38:17.150 --> 38:18.560
SOME HOOPS AT THE PARK,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

38:18.710 --> 38:20.189
- OKAY, SO MY BEDROOM DOOR
IS 34 INCHES WIDE.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.082
IS THAT WIDE ENOUGH
TO ACCOMMODATE A WHEELCHAIR?

38:22.230 --> 38:24.562
BECAUSE MICAH'S PULLING
INTO THE DRIVEWAY.

38:24.710 --> 38:25.779
both: WHO'S MICAH?

38:25.920 --> 38:27.649

JUST SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.536
I WENT AHEAD AND I WROTE THEM
DOWN FOR YOU.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.717

SO HE NEEDS A LITTLE EXTRA HELP.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.191
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT JUST THE CHAIR,

39:07.340 --> 39:08.716
IT'S A COUPLE

HAD A FRIEND BEFORE.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.623
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
SWEETHEART, IT'S OKAY.

39:20.770 --> 39:23.000
