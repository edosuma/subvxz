<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:08.367 --> 00:11.268
<i>Beck finds it harder to
maintain his double life...</i>

00:11.302 --> 00:13.964
You want time off? Again?!

00:13.999 --> 00:16.273
I need programs I can count on, Beck.

00:16.306 --> 00:20.944
- You need to go again.
- Can't. Got a job, remember?

00:20.979 --> 00:25.015
<i>...as his freedom fighting alter ego
finds increasing success.</i>

00:25.049 --> 00:27.184
The Renegade has actually
built quite a reputation.

00:27.218 --> 00:29.186
It's him! It's the Renegade!

00:29.220 --> 00:32.022
Some even say he's Tron.

00:32.055 --> 00:34.291
This guy's no Tron.
He's a menace!

00:36.894 --> 00:40.263
<i>The curfew is for your protection</i>

00:40.298 --> 00:43.934
<i>and the safety of your fellow programs.</i>

00:45.336 --> 00:48.905
<i>The curfew is for your protection</i>

00:48.940 --> 00:51.975
<i>and the safety of
your fellow programs...</i>

01:24.976 --> 01:29.012
<i>Hey, program!
You're in violation of curfew!</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:30.847
<i>Surrender immediately!</i>

01:40.992 --> 01:43.060
Come with us.

02:01.482 --> 02:11.002
<b>S01E11 - Grounded</font>

02:18.169 --> 02:20.737
- Is that all of them?
- Affirmative.

02:20.772 --> 02:23.740
- Next stop, games.
- You're too late!

02:25.810 --> 02:27.811
Come on.
Let's just talk about this.

02:29.647 --> 02:31.114
Fine, have it your way.

02:37.722 --> 02:41.725
- Surrender, program.
- This better work.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.930
Huh. It worked.

02:48.733 --> 02:52.002
- You're really him!
- The one and only.

02:52.036 --> 02:55.806
- You meant Tron, right?
- How do I thank you?

02:55.840 --> 02:59.743
Next time don't get caught.
And tell your friends.

02:59.777 --> 03:02.646
Wait. Tell them what?

03:03.981 --> 03:06.950
Wait! Tell them what?!

03:06.984 --> 03:10.520
Tron lives, General. It's true.

03:10.555 --> 03:13.690
- Impossible!
- But I saw him with my...

03:15.626 --> 03:16.860
Are you calling me a liar?

03:16.894 --> 03:19.563
You're not a liar, Sir.
I just...

03:32.777 --> 03:35.712
Pavel, get someone in
here to clean this mess up.

03:35.746 --> 03:38.548
Right away, your voraciousness.

03:38.583 --> 03:42.686
There's been too many rumors,
too much chatter about this.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.790
"Tron lives."
It's time we deliver a message.

03:48.559 --> 03:52.562
<i>Match extended. Now
entering triple overtime.</i>

03:54.966 --> 03:57.834
<i>Ahh. I can't take it.</i>

03:57.869 --> 04:00.637
They've been on that
platform since we got here.

04:00.671 --> 04:04.641
- It's their nineteenth game!
- You've been counting?

04:04.675 --> 04:08.578
Of course I've been counting!
It's called "court etiquette."

04:08.613 --> 04:10.947
Where's that Renegade
when we really need him?

04:10.982 --> 04:14.718
Maybe he's taking a break.
I'm sure he's got friends, too.

04:14.752 --> 04:17.887
Friends? Him?!
Seriously, if he were my friend,

04:17.922 --> 04:20.891
I'd still be the first
person to turn him in.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.836
<i>Greetings, programs.</i>

04:32.870 --> 04:35.672
<i>I address you now
not only as your General</i>

04:35.706 --> 04:38.775
<i>but also as a resident of
this magnificent metropolis.</i>

04:38.809 --> 04:41.978
<i>Like all of you, I want nothing
more than to see Argon prosper.</i>

04:42.013 --> 04:48.585
<i>I'm afraid we've lost some of
our streets to masked vigilantes.</i>

04:48.619 --> 04:52.489
<i>This Renegade has
made our city unsafe...</i>

04:52.523 --> 04:56.560
<i>and who has to pay for his
relentless campaign of terror?</i>

04:56.594 --> 04:58.962
<i>You. The hardworking
citizens of Argon.</i>

04:58.996 --> 05:02.832
<i>These programs were
apprehended disobeying curfew...</i>

05:02.867 --> 05:05.502
<i>a curfew put in place
because of the Renegade's</i>

05:05.536 --> 05:08.672
<i>selfish, destructive activities.</i>

05:08.706 --> 05:11.808
<i>But I see no reason
why they should be punished</i>

05:11.842 --> 05:15.612
<i>for the actions of one malcontent.</i>

05:15.646 --> 05:18.281
<i>Which is why I will
exonerate these prisoners</i>

05:18.282 --> 05:20.917
<i>and permanently abolish all curfews...</i>

05:20.952 --> 05:24.354
<i>if the Renegade surrenders himself</i>

05:24.355 --> 05:27.757
<i>in Argon square by
the end of this cycle.</i>

05:27.792 --> 05:31.228
<i>Consider it a show
of good faith from me,</i>

05:31.229 --> 05:34.664
<i>your benevolent leader, to all of you.</i>

05:34.699 --> 05:37.601
<i>Are you listening, Renegade?!</i>

05:37.635 --> 05:41.605
<i>Fail to show up and these programs
take their chances at the games.</i>

05:41.639 --> 05:45.609
<i>You say you're fighting
for them... prove it.</i>

05:47.912 --> 05:52.482
It's about time.
Beck, you're on my team.

05:52.516 --> 05:54.951
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:00.591 --> 06:03.960
Excellent elocution, General.
A stirring address.

06:03.995 --> 06:07.697
But how do you know
the Renegade will take the bait?

06:07.732 --> 06:10.834
Because he has no choice.

06:10.868 --> 06:13.470
<i>What do you mean
you have no choice?</i>

06:13.504 --> 06:16.640
I can't let Tesler just send
those programs away to the games.

06:16.674 --> 06:18.608
Not if I can save them.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.543
<i>He's baiting you, Beck.</i>

06:20.578 --> 06:23.680
<i>You show up and you'll
be walking into a trap.</i>

06:23.714 --> 06:25.849
I never said it'd be easy.

06:25.883 --> 06:29.653
Tron doesn't give up.
Never has, never will.

06:29.687 --> 06:31.621
It's time the city knows that.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.791
Fine. But we'll need a strategy.

06:34.825 --> 06:37.761
Tesler will be expecting
you at the end of this cycle.

06:37.795 --> 06:40.730
You need to reach those
hostages before then.

06:40.765 --> 06:43.800
No problem. I'll get Zed
to cover me at the garage.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.336
Make it quick.
We're already out of time,

06:46.337 --> 06:48.838
and you're no good to
anyone if you're dead.

06:48.873 --> 06:51.474
Huh. Don't take this personally,

06:51.509 --> 06:54.711
but your pep talks
could use some improvement.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.546
Just hurry back.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.953
Stop. You're not authorized...

07:07.725 --> 07:10.627
<i>Sorry, Paige,
but it's appointment only.</i>

07:10.661 --> 07:13.763
I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you to wait outside.

07:13.798 --> 07:17.667
Touch me and those sentries will
be sweeping you off the floor.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.640
Paige, don't worry. Pavel's
just doing a few minor upgrades.

07:23.674 --> 07:27.577
I'm not worried, General,
just confused as to why Pavel thinks

07:27.611 --> 07:31.648
he can waste your time with upgrades
that are entirely unnecessary.

07:31.682 --> 07:34.451
You said yourself...
he's not Tron.

07:34.485 --> 07:36.653
Well, he might be Tron.

07:36.687 --> 07:39.923
- Pavel...
- Probably not, you're right,

07:39.957 --> 07:44.427
but just in case he is,
that's what these are for.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.801
I don't care if
he's Flynn himself...

07:51.836 --> 07:53.903
he's still gonna die...

07:53.938 --> 07:56.906
a magnificent death.

08:08.786 --> 08:10.487
Able!

08:10.521 --> 08:12.822
I'm sorry, I'll find someone
to help you pick all this up.

08:12.857 --> 08:16.726
Beck, stop! You're late! Again!

08:16.761 --> 08:18.661
I know, and I'm sorry.

08:18.696 --> 08:22.465
Look at you, Beck.
You're hardly ever on time!

08:22.500 --> 08:25.568
And when you are on time,
you're unfocused!

08:25.603 --> 08:28.638
Responsibility may
mean nothing to you,

08:28.672 --> 08:33.510
but to me, it's serious.
That's why I'm grounding you.

08:33.544 --> 08:37.414
- Wait. You're what?
- Until the start of the next cycle,

08:37.448 --> 08:40.517
you're to stay here
at the garage. Working.

08:40.751 --> 08:44.387
- No exceptions.
- This isn't happening!

08:44.422 --> 08:46.489
It most certainly is.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.674
Help Zed with whatever he needs.
Do not leave his side.

08:54.791 --> 08:58.560
And remember,
I'm keeping my eye on you.

09:01.777 --> 09:03.463
So, let me get this straight.

09:03.575 --> 09:07.246
- Helping me is your punishment?
- Looks that way.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.461
Come on. Able can't punish you for at least
looking like you're helping, right?

09:11.567 --> 09:14.583
- I'm sure he'll find a way.
- Can you really blame him?

09:14.724 --> 09:19.338
Yeah. It's just...
you're always late.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.735
And that's only when you
actually bother to show up at all.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.490
I've been late plenty of times.
He's never held me captive.

09:25.592 --> 09:28.582
Captive?
You're not a hostage, Beck.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.436
You're a mechanic.
This is your job.

09:31.996 --> 09:35.998
I mean, I'm genuinely surprised
he hasn't fired you yet.

09:36.033 --> 09:40.770
Hey Beck, are you okay?
I heard Able came down hard on you.

09:40.804 --> 09:43.940
You heard?
Wait... who else knows?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.676
Well... everybody?

09:46.710 --> 09:48.878
- I don't believe this.
- Me neither.

09:48.912 --> 09:51.047
No offense to Beck,
but you'd think everyone

09:51.081 --> 09:53.749
would be talking about
the Renegade surrender.

09:53.784 --> 09:55.885
What's gotten you
in such a good mood?

09:55.919 --> 09:58.054
I thought I just said it.

09:58.088 --> 10:01.090
Anyway... can I borrow you?

10:01.124 --> 10:04.126
I need someone with
small, feminine hands.

10:04.161 --> 10:06.696
I'm your guy.

10:16.039 --> 10:17.874
<i>This better not be...</i>

10:17.908 --> 10:20.676
- what it looks like.
- Ohh!

10:21.979 --> 10:26.115
Had to get my wrench.
You know, to help Zed.

10:26.149 --> 10:30.987
Beck, whatever you have that you
think is more important, it's not.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.889
Trust me. It is.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.692
Why should I trust you when
you insist on lying to my face?

10:38.061 --> 10:42.798
Look, what happened to Bodhi
has been hard on all of us.

10:42.833 --> 10:46.903
- This isn't about Bodhi.
- You're right. It's about you.

10:46.937 --> 10:50.006
I'm punishing you for a reason, Beck.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.176
I wish you could see that.
I'm only trying to help.

10:54.211 --> 10:56.178
Then maybe you shouldn't.

10:58.749 --> 11:02.151
- Let's go. Back to work.
- Fine.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.760
Come on, Beck. Where are you?

11:21.004 --> 11:24.941
- Where's everyone going?
- It's almost time.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.493
Yeah, time for everyone
in Argon to find out

11:27.494 --> 11:30.012
what a fraud this Renegade really is.

11:30.047 --> 11:33.749
You don't think there's even
a chance he could actually be Tron?

11:33.784 --> 11:35.785
Not only am I certain he's no Tron,

11:35.819 --> 11:39.088
but I'm betting on him
not even showing up at all.

11:39.122 --> 11:44.927
You've got a real upbeat
perspective, you know that, Zed?

11:44.962 --> 11:47.763
I suppose there's always a-a chance!

11:47.798 --> 11:50.766
<i>Just... not a big... chance.</i>

11:50.801 --> 11:54.737
Beck! Don't get any ideas.

11:54.771 --> 11:57.039
I'm leaving Link here
to watch the garage.

11:57.074 --> 12:00.009
Now, I need to know I can
trust you to stay here.

12:00.043 --> 12:01.711
Of course.

12:01.745 --> 12:06.482
- I want your word, Beck.
- I promise.

12:35.946 --> 12:40.116
General, let me handle the Renegade.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.151
He's not worth your effort.

12:42.185 --> 12:45.721
Just keep everyone out of my way.

12:45.756 --> 12:47.790
It could get ugly.

12:51.862 --> 12:56.699
Beck, I promised Able I'd keep you here.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.035
And I promised Able I'd stay.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.837
Looks like we're both gonna
have to break our promise.

13:01.872 --> 13:05.875
I can't stop you, but I
have to tell Able if he asks.

13:05.909 --> 13:08.878
- I don't want to lie to him.
- I know.

13:08.912 --> 13:10.946
And you shouldn't have to.

13:10.981 --> 13:14.950
I can't blame you for wanting to
get a glimpse of Tron in action.

13:14.985 --> 13:19.021
Me, I've seen him.
This could be your last chance.

13:19.056 --> 13:22.758
This could be Argon's last chance.

13:31.134 --> 13:33.502
<i>Programs of Argon,</i>

13:33.537 --> 13:36.906
<i>your support in coming out
to such a momentous occasion</i>

13:36.940 --> 13:41.110
<i>proves that you care
deeply about the future of your city.</i>

13:41.144 --> 13:44.980
<i>But I can't help but notice
the absence of one of you.</i>

13:45.015 --> 13:47.083
<i>That's right, Argon...</i>

13:47.117 --> 13:50.986
<i>where is... the Renegade?</i>

13:51.021 --> 13:54.890
<i>You see? The Renegade
doesn't care about any of you!</i>

13:54.925 --> 13:57.026
<i>And he's certainly no Tron.</i>

13:57.060 --> 14:02.031
<i>Because if he were, he'd be here.</i>

14:02.065 --> 14:05.801
<i>But let's not dwell on the past.</i>

14:05.836 --> 14:09.805
<i>Instead, let us
look to a new era...</i>

14:09.840 --> 14:14.844
<i>an era of achievement, of perfection...</i>

14:14.878 --> 14:16.812
<i>of Clu.</i>

14:29.126 --> 14:31.293
What'd I miss?

14:57.746 --> 15:00.948
<i>You wanted me? Here I am!</i>

15:00.982 --> 15:05.586
<i>I see that.
You certainly took your time.</i>

15:05.620 --> 15:08.622
<i>You've got what you want.
Now let the prisoners go.</i>

15:08.657 --> 15:11.759
Normally I don't
negotiate with terrorists.

15:11.793 --> 15:14.929
<i>But... I'm a program of my word.</i>

15:14.963 --> 15:16.597
We're free!

15:16.631 --> 15:21.669
- And the curfew?
- Let's not get greedy.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.971
The deal was surrender.

15:26.341 --> 15:29.977
I've been waiting for
this for a very long time...

15:30.011 --> 15:32.813
the end of the infamous Renegade.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.717
Sorry to disappoint,
but I'm no Renegade.

15:36.751 --> 15:41.655
I'm Tron. Now shut up and fight!

15:41.690 --> 15:44.658
Let's finish this
somewhere more private.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.898
Great.

16:02.010 --> 16:03.961
You trust too easily. You think those

16:03.962 --> 16:05.913
programs up there will
fight by your side?

16:05.947 --> 16:08.682
Their loyalty is to the state.

16:10.986 --> 16:13.554
I rule the state!

16:27.669 --> 16:29.637
Wait. Wait. H-hang on.

16:31.940 --> 16:32.973
Seriously?

16:56.698 --> 16:58.766
This ends now.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.696
You're no Tron, but you're
about to share his fate.

17:49.951 --> 17:51.785
You want this to end?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.854
Then come on! Let's end it!

17:58.727 --> 18:00.628
Another time.

18:19.914 --> 18:24.852
All hail the indomitable
General Tesler...

18:24.886 --> 18:28.489
your victor in this
electrifying encounter!

18:28.523 --> 18:32.593
Now get back to your homes!
All of you!

18:32.627 --> 18:34.862
There's a curfew still in effect!

18:51.646 --> 18:52.946
<i>You've changed things, Beck.</i>

18:52.981 --> 18:55.949
<i>How so? Tesler nearly beat me.</i>

18:55.984 --> 18:59.486
<i>I doubt he's planning on
lifting the curfew anytime soon.</i>

18:59.521 --> 19:02.890
From where I'm sitting,
looks a lot like square one.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.826
Standing up to Tesler
showed those programs

19:05.860 --> 19:10.664
that they don't have to sit idly by.
They can choose to fight.

19:10.699 --> 19:14.568
And when they do, they'll
have you to fight beside.

19:14.602 --> 19:16.403
No, you were right, Beck.

19:16.438 --> 19:19.740
I suppose I should thank
you for saving my life...

19:19.774 --> 19:23.610
- for the fifth time.
- What are you talking about?

19:23.645 --> 19:26.780
Okay, okay, sixth.
But I'm not counting Pergos.

19:26.815 --> 19:28.882
I had that gang under control.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.586
Beck, I've been here
this whole time.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.656
Then if it wasn't you...

19:37.525 --> 19:39.827
<i>Uh... you need a hand?</i>

19:39.861 --> 19:43.564
<i>I've got some time
before my shift starts.</i>

19:43.598 --> 19:47.735
What? Oh!
Yeah, if you don't mind.

19:47.769 --> 19:51.538
I don't. I'm sorry about before.

19:51.573 --> 19:56.643
You're right. I shouldn't have said
those things about the Renegade being...

19:56.678 --> 19:58.479
Beck!

20:00.949 --> 20:04.785
Where have you been?
Able has been looking all over.

20:04.819 --> 20:06.854
I heard. I'm avoiding him.

20:06.888 --> 20:09.523
And what better place to
avoid him than his own garage?

20:09.557 --> 20:13.861
Beck. My office. Now.

20:16.865 --> 20:20.868
I sure wouldn't want to
be Beck right now.

20:20.902 --> 20:23.304
Have a seat.

20:23.838 --> 20:25.773
Look, I know I messed up, but...

20:25.807 --> 20:27.641
Beck, stop.

20:27.675 --> 20:33.480
What I have to say
I hoped I'd never have to say.

20:33.515 --> 20:35.816
So, here goes.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.488
How did you become the Renegade?

20:44.692 --> 20:48.462
It's okay, Beck, I... I know.

20:48.496 --> 20:51.765
- H-how long have you known?
- Too long.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.601
I was foolish to think
I could keep you here...

20:54.636 --> 20:56.703
to think I could protect you.

20:56.738 --> 20:59.740
It was you. On the bike.

20:59.774 --> 21:01.942
You took out Tesler!

21:01.976 --> 21:07.681
Now, how could an old program like
me possibly manage a stunt like that?

21:07.715 --> 21:12.886
About what happened before,
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

21:12.921 --> 21:17.791
Forget it. I'm sorry you had
to carry this secret for so long.

21:17.826 --> 21:20.802
That couldn't have been easy.

21:20.803 --> 21:24.731
It wasn't. So... now what?

21:24.766 --> 21:29.436
Well, I think you and I
have a lot to talk about.

21:29.471 --> 21:31.605
<i>When you're ready.</i>
