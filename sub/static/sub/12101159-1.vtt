WEBVTT

00:15.939 --> 00:17.439
-You know what, bitch?

00:18.739 --> 00:21.364
You fucked with the wrong one.

00:22.239 --> 00:22.929
I'm gonna kill you.

00:22.929 --> 00:24.519
in front of your little boyfriend,

00:24.530 --> 00:26.164
and then I'm gonna kill him.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.765
-Oh, my God, Celess, this better be important.

01:10.939 --> 01:12.765
-Tina, I had that dream again.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.765
-I told you to stop falling asleep to The First 48.

01:17.588 --> 01:19.088
Shit, maybe you're right.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.880
-I know I'm right.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.680
And besides, death and dreams just means new beginnings.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.890
And speaking of which,

01:24.890 --> 01:28.303
tonight's New Year's Eve party is gonna be so fucking lit,

01:28.500 --> 01:30.165
and it's your birthday, Bitch.

01:30.939 --> 01:33.299
-To be honest, I'm not even in the mood.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.024
I really just want to sit on the couch,

01:35.024 --> 01:37.965
and sip champagne with the love of my life,
and watch the ball drop.

01:40.340 --> 01:42.754
Okay, for one, you're on the phone
with the only motherfucker

01:42.754 --> 01:44.560
that got real love for your ass.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.370
And two, the only couch we're going be on is in VIP.

01:47.379 --> 01:50.963
And three, fairy tale endings don't happen
for girls like us, okay?

01:51.299 --> 01:53.719
So I'm gonna need you to get up, go in the closet,

01:53.719 --> 01:57.569
pop the tags on one of them badass dresses,
and get snatched, bitch.

01:57.579 --> 01:59.079
It's hunting season.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.669
-Ooh, he's cute as fuck.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.465
-That number on his chain even cuter.

02:25.039 --> 02:27.365
What you think? Football or basketball?

02:27.740 --> 02:32.019
-Shit, I don't even know. But either one will work.
Shoot your shot, sis.

02:32.599 --> 02:34.729
-Uh-uh, not with all them thotties in his face.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.175
I'll wait till he go to the bathroom or something.

02:38.603 --> 02:40.103
-Can I get you all, anything else?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.272
-Actually...

02:54.800 --> 02:56.365
-What did you just do, bitch?

02:57.039 --> 02:58.199
-Send them a bottle of Ace,

02:58.199 --> 03:00.664
and we'll be the only girls they see for the rest of the night.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.598
-Come again, a bottle of Ace?
-Yeah.

03:03.598 --> 03:04.949
-Ain't that's a $1000 bottle.

03:04.949 --> 03:09.750
-No, that's $1000 investment
that I guarantee we'll see a return on.

03:14.199 --> 03:16.164
It was Tina who put me up on game.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.624
She taught me everything.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.232
From how to scout the players,

03:25.199 --> 03:26.699
to how to score.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.164
-Voila.
-Thots, be gone.

03:45.468 --> 03:47.064
-Cheers.
-Bitch.

03:47.439 --> 03:50.064
-Hi, who we owe for this gift?

03:51.240 --> 03:53.740
-Put your money away, don't insult us like that.

03:54.539 --> 03:57.075
-Is that right? What's your name?

03:57.075 --> 03:58.949
-Tina.
-Tina, I'm Khalil.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.780
This my brother, James.

04:01.469 --> 04:03.193
-James Allen.

04:05.099 --> 04:06.599
The pleasure is all mine.

04:07.139 --> 04:08.639
-Celess.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.127
It's nice to meet you.

04:13.199 --> 04:17.567
# I'm on my shit
Get off my dick

04:19.399 --> 04:20.899
# I'm on my shit

04:22.209 --> 04:24.857
# Get off my dick
Trick or treat

04:25.930 --> 04:28.338
#  Sweet, sweet
A freak in the sheets

04:29.509 --> 04:30.901
#  Quit playing with me

04:30.901 --> 04:34.300
# I don't got time for games, no
One hunnit degrees

04:34.399 --> 04:35.600
# I turn it up

04:35.600 --> 04:38.180
# I'm too pretty
I'm too rich for the banging

04:38.180 --> 04:39.634
# But I do know some real ones

04:39.634 --> 04:41.269
# That'll make you tuck your chain in

04:41.269 --> 04:42.928
#<i> Oh, my God!
Thank you, Jesus.</i>

04:42.928 --> 04:44.300
# Whaddup famous
You a genius

04:44.300 --> 04:45.730
# I don't sing like Christina,

04:45.730 --> 04:47.712
# but I shake it like Miss Tina

04:47.712 --> 04:47.970
#  Call me Turner

04:47.970 --> 04:49.610
# How I turn up
Bitch, I'm lit

04:49.610 --> 04:50.339
# Like the furnace

04:50.339 --> 04:52.261
# Why you bitches always worried

04:52.261 --> 04:53.847
# Who I'm fucking
What I'm earning

04:54.419 --> 04:55.540
# Last time I checked

04:55.540 --> 04:56.800
# I'm worth a millie-o

04:56.800 --> 04:59.430
# It's some pretty little hoes
in my peripheral

04:59.899 --> 05:02.649
# Dipping thru my city ho
I run my fucking city ho

05:02.649 --> 05:04.329
# Margielas on my tippy toes

05:04.329 --> 05:06.300
# I'm shining diamonds
like a Christmas show

05:06.300 --> 05:08.100
#  Come from Tiffany and Co

05:08.100 --> 05:09.399
# Ship em to Sydney coast

05:09.399 --> 05:10.790
# Like a deli I got dope

05:10.790 --> 05:12.959
# Got these bitches looking broke

05:13.399 --> 05:15.000
# If it ain't bout no money
Shut up hoe

05:16.300 --> 05:19.220
# All the millies
Got me feeling stuck up hoe

05:19.600 --> 05:22.199
# They can never treat me
Like I'm broke.

05:22.209 --> 05:25.177
# All I know is
How to get this dough

05:25.800 --> 05:30.264
# I'm on my shit
Get off my dick

05:31.742 --> 05:33.264
# I'm on my shit

05:35.084 --> 05:36.584
# Get off my dick

05:37.000 --> 05:38.813
# Yea yea yea
Walk it like I talk it

05:38.813 --> 05:40.319
# Pulling off in that red spyda

05:40.319 --> 05:43.264
# Skeert that's that Peter Parker

05:44.139 --> 05:46.165
For the year to have started off so right,

05:47.139 --> 05:49.464
I should have known shit was bound to go left.

05:50.639 --> 05:52.665
This would be the year that changed my life,

05:53.439 --> 05:55.504
and I don't exactly mean for the better.

06:01.639 --> 06:04.592
Atlanta was one of those cities
that people could come to

06:04.592 --> 06:06.264
and completely reinvent themselves.

06:07.500 --> 06:12.100
A society of people with ugly pasts
and hopes for prettier futures.

06:13.199 --> 06:15.564
I happen to be a part of that society.

06:15.939 --> 06:17.665
But, we'll get to that later.

06:18.399 --> 06:22.500
The most important thing for me and my girl, Tina,
was survival.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.199
 And there was only one way we saw fit to achieve that,

06:26.399 --> 06:30.381
capping up men, very successful men.

06:33.838 --> 06:36.165
O was my hustler from East Atlanta.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.300
He wasn't the settle down type

06:38.399 --> 06:39.920
because he was already married

06:40.697 --> 06:42.454
to the street,

06:42.454 --> 06:45.264
but he spoiled the fuck out of me.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.540
Then there was Tariq.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.165
He was my real estate investor from the Carolinas.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.180
He wasn't anything like O.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.764
He had all the book smarts in the world,
but he lacked in street smarts,

07:07.139 --> 07:12.188
so I was able to get into his pockets
without him getting into my pants.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.634
Now, James...

07:19.634 --> 07:22.050
James was my baller from Georgia State,

07:22.060 --> 07:24.750
except he didn't have any money, yet.

07:24.759 --> 07:28.199
He was on his way to the NBA draft
in a couple of months,

07:28.209 --> 07:30.519
so that was gonna change.

07:30.529 --> 07:31.889
And when that happened,

07:31.889 --> 07:34.485
his brother Khalil was going to take his illegal funds

07:34.485 --> 07:36.764
and turn them into a legitimate business.

07:37.139 --> 07:39.410
So that way, when those basketball checks clear,

07:39.420 --> 07:41.865
we could all be eating in peace.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.250
It was a full time job juggling them all.

07:45.259 --> 07:49.180
Like Tina would say,
you don't work, you don't eat.

07:49.189 --> 07:51.709
-But he's all wrinkly and going bald.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.490
-Okay? And so is Benjamin Franklin.
You got mad love for his ass.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.990
So be nice.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.990
And we worked them all.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.750
-You like?
-I'll take all of them.

08:06.439 --> 08:07.939
Thank you.

08:09.339 --> 08:10.629
-Damn, you're sexy.

08:10.629 --> 08:15.369
-Excuse me? I'm a huge fan of your fights, champ.
Can I get a picture?

08:15.369 --> 08:16.869
-All day.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.540
Hey, baby. Handle that.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.115
Let's get it.

08:23.515 --> 08:25.865
Come, let me take it
-Okay.

08:38.139 --> 08:40.465
Here, baby. I'll take a better one for you. Let's see.

08:48.539 --> 08:50.667
We were everything to everybody,

08:50.667 --> 08:54.615
showing genuine interest
in whatever it was that they did.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.588
See, the key to it was to make everyone feel like

09:17.588 --> 09:19.738
he was the only one.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.965
-That *** ain't get drafted to the NBA. That's bullshit.

09:29.639 --> 09:32.264
-Bruce Jenner was drafted to the NBA, bro.
I'm trying to tell you.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.440
Look that shit up.

09:34.539 --> 09:36.139
-He didn't get drafted to the league,

09:36.149 --> 09:38.480
but he did get drafted to the other team.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.700
-Hey, real talk?

09:42.139 --> 09:44.365
I can't stand motherfuckers with all that pretending shit.

09:44.840 --> 09:49.164
Be on the DL. Be straight ***, dressing like bitches.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.965
-That shit foul boy.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.264
-Yo, check this out. Back in Philly where I'm from,

09:55.740 --> 09:57.909
there was these trannies that used to dress like bitches.

09:57.919 --> 10:04.365
Skirts, dresses, makeup, nice ass, perky ass titties, all that.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.865
And no homo, them bitches was bad as fuck.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.664
But they was messing with straight dudes.

10:11.539 --> 10:13.289
-And you tellin' me the *** didn't know they was ***?

10:13.299 --> 10:16.110
-Fuck no, them bitches was bad, bro.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.259
-Fuck out of here, man.

10:18.259 --> 10:21.065
Yo, listen, shit got crazy one time.

10:21.539 --> 10:24.529
One of these *** found out,
they was looking for one of these bitches,

10:24.539 --> 10:26.865
trying to take their head off, trying to kill 'em.

10:27.740 --> 10:30.340
Bitches got scared, they moved to the A.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.039
-Yeah?

10:32.039 --> 10:34.865
-See a *** like you, easy target.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.764
First round draft pick, millions of dollars.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.065
Man, you're a quick come up, my G.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.340
-Wow, that's crazy.

10:42.639 --> 10:44.139
-You know their names?

10:44.740 --> 10:47.399
-Think one of them bitches name was Tina and...

10:47.538 --> 10:49.951
-... Ce-- motherfucking --less.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.500
-Say it ain't so, Celess.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.240
-A man?

10:54.639 --> 10:56.965
James, that's the most bogus shit I ever heard.

10:59.139 --> 11:01.269
Matter of fact, where's the *** that said this shit,

11:01.269 --> 11:03.187
so I can tell him to keep my name
outta his fucking mouth,

11:03.187 --> 11:04.687
because that shit's insane.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.264
-I thought the same thing at first.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.427
Like, nah, couldn't be.
-You damn right, it can't be.

11:10.427 --> 11:12.340
A man, are you serious, James?

11:12.350 --> 11:14.965
You know I ain't no fucking man.
And you know this shit first hand.

11:15.539 --> 11:17.039
- Then I started thinking

11:17.539 --> 11:19.039
You don't never want to fuck in the light.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.090
You always make me hit it from the back.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.535
What the fuck am I putting it in, Celess, your ass?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.740
-Seriously?

11:24.740 --> 11:26.509
And you ain't never not once asked me to eat your pussy.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.409
-My pussy?

11:27.409 --> 11:30.129
If I can remember correctly,
it was you who said you don't eat pussy.

11:30.450 --> 11:33.330
-I tell every female that. Didn't stop them from askin' me to make an exception.

11:33.340 --> 11:34.649
-I'm not every female.

11:34.649 --> 11:36.664
-Are you even a fucking female?

11:38.139 --> 11:39.639
Come here.

11:40.539 --> 11:42.649
What do you have to hide? If you're not a man, prove it.

11:42.659 --> 11:43.799
It's that fucking simple.

11:43.799 --> 11:44.917
-James, you know me.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.599
-Miss me with that, James, you know me, crap.

11:47.599 --> 11:48.700
Open this motherfucking door.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.429
Prove to me you're not a man.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.565
-James, you're scaring me.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.065
-On everything, Celess. You got three seconds
to open this goddamned door.

11:57.740 --> 12:00.169
-I just know if I would have told you the truth,

12:00.169 --> 12:01.730
you would have never dealt with me.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.700
-Are you fucking crazy?

12:03.710 --> 12:05.210
Hell no I wouldn't have dealt with you.

12:05.639 --> 12:07.365
You're a motherfucking man.
James, please.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.365
-I'm not gay.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.240
Please.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.870
-There's two things keeping me from breaking
your motherfucking neck right now.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.664
And I promise you, this door ain't one of them.

12:18.139 --> 12:20.664
The fact, too many people seen me
come into this hotel room with you.

12:21.039 --> 12:24.065
And the fact I get drafted tomorrow,
and I don't need a fucking murder case.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.365
But I promise you this, Celess,
if you call my motherfucking phone,

12:30.240 --> 12:32.924
if I'm out and you see me,

12:32.924 --> 12:35.309
bitch, if you even look in my motherfucking direction,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.936
I will kill you right there on the fucking spot.
Do you hear me?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.388
You selfish bitch.

12:53.179 --> 12:54.793
So, that was my secret.

12:55.899 --> 12:58.065
My name wasn't always Celess.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.303
-We heard you got one. Show us that jawn
-Boy you bugging.

13:20.303 --> 13:21.879
Whoever told you that, lied to you.

13:21.889 --> 13:24.764
-Bitch you're tripping, you faggot.
-Get your fucking hands off me!

13:25.240 --> 13:27.470
-Yo, what's going on?
-Hey, mind your own business, yo.

13:27.830 --> 13:29.330
-She is my business.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.919
Do you like seeing?
-What?

13:32.049 --> 13:34.264
-***, do you enjoy your ability to see?

13:36.139 --> 13:38.350
Because if this shit gets anywhere near your face,

13:38.389 --> 13:41.065
it'll hurt so bad, you'll try to pull your own eyes out.

13:44.039 --> 13:45.539
-Weirdo ass ***.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.250
-Tina, you okay?
-I am now, thanks to you.

13:54.259 --> 13:57.240
-What was that about?
-They were trying to get me to show them my dick.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.751
-You say the craziest shit, yo.
-I'm serious.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.529
Wait. You ain't know?
-Know what?

14:01.669 --> 14:02.840
-My secret.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.340
-Are you for real right now?

14:17.539 --> 14:19.965
-So now that you know my secret, tell me yours.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.382
-Tell you my what? Shit. I'm still stuck on the fact

14:24.382 --> 14:27.590
that you have a-- you're a --
-Yes, all of that.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.019
Now just spit it out.

14:29.019 --> 14:31.200
Tina, I don't know what you're talking about.

14:31.210 --> 14:33.679
-Just say it.
I promise it will make you feel so much better.

14:33.710 --> 14:36.565
-I have no secrets, bitch.
-You're gay, Charles.

14:38.139 --> 14:39.639
-Why you say that?

14:39.940 --> 14:42.264
-You carry mace, my ***, not a gun.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.465
I bet you that's Lady Gaga you're listening to.
-What?

14:49.240 --> 14:52.070
Uh, I'm not g--
-Listen to me.

14:52.330 --> 14:56.065
Be true to yourself, whoever don't like that,
fuck them with both of our dicks.

15:08.139 --> 15:11.865
-Don't worry, friend.
In no time at all, you'll forget all about James.

15:13.240 --> 15:17.340
-Forget about James?
I'm more worried about James forgetting about me.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.899
He seemed real upset. You think he told Khalil yet?

15:20.909 --> 15:22.764
-Oh, no. And I don't think he will.

15:23.639 --> 15:25.565
-No, I think he definitely told him.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.049
-Girl, I don't know.

15:28.049 --> 15:30.639
No straight *** want people to know he fucked a man,

15:30.649 --> 15:33.764
whether he knew or not.
That's some shit you take to the grave.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.065
Besides, Khalil ass is in jail, girl.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.029
While you was in New York with James,
I got a call from motherfucking jail.

15:43.039 --> 15:46.091
I guess the DA found out
how he made that quarter millie

15:46.091 --> 15:47.591
for the hookah lounge buildout.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.065
-You're lying.
-Mm-mm.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.664
-Damn. Now I feel extra bad.

15:54.039 --> 15:56.779
The two people James wanted to share
this moment with the most,

15:56.779 --> 15:58.139
me and Khalil,

15:58.139 --> 15:59.799
we ain't even in the picture anymore.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.590
Just like that.

16:02.039 --> 16:03.289
Damn, that's crazy.

16:03.289 --> 16:06.909
-Bottom line,
James is about to be in another state,

16:06.909 --> 16:08.120
playing in the league,

16:08.120 --> 16:10.759
and Khalil ass is doing time, time.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.950
They're gonna fall out of touch real soon.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.940
We ain't got nothing to worry about.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.365
-The last time I felt this bad...

16:20.840 --> 16:23.065
it was when I first came out to my mom.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.965
Charles, what have I told you
about leaving my refrigerator door open?

16:39.539 --> 16:41.769
-Hey, Mom. You know my friend Tina?

16:42.538 --> 16:46.070
What about Tina?
-She's not really a girl, Mom.

16:48.039 --> 16:51.019
-Charles, I wish I had time to play games
with you today,

16:51.019 --> 16:53.539
but I gotta get your dinner ready
before I do my second shift.

16:53.549 --> 16:59.659
-Mom, Tina is a boy, but she identifies as a girl, and...

17:00.240 --> 17:01.970
I think I want to do that, too.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.670
-Okay. Gone and yell psych so I can get the hell on.
-I'm not kidding, Mom.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.170
I want to start living my life as a girl.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.559
-So you're calling me a liar?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.200
I spent so many nights defending you,

17:32.000 --> 17:35.028
telling your father
that you was just going through a phase.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.170
I lost my husband because of you.

17:42.839 --> 17:45.859
And now you're gonna tell me that I was wrong,

17:47.740 --> 17:49.359
that I made a mistake,

17:51.940 --> 17:53.670
that God made a mistake?

17:57.839 --> 18:00.059
-So Dad left because of me?

18:12.640 --> 18:14.140
-Listen to me, son.

18:20.339 --> 18:22.089
God made you a boy.

18:23.339 --> 18:25.559
And he meant for you to grow up
and become a man

18:27.440 --> 18:29.827
and marry a woman.

18:36.039 --> 18:40.670
And as long as you are living underneath my roof

18:41.539 --> 18:43.960
and wearing the clothes that I bought with my pay check,

18:48.940 --> 18:50.670
that's exactly what you're gonna do.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.170
Do you hear me?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.359
Like I was saying, we belong to a society,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.029
a secret society,

19:05.039 --> 19:08.170
of girls trapped inside boys bodies.

19:08.900 --> 19:14.269
It's a curse, a prison without bars, a false reality,

19:15.039 --> 19:16.539
where the only thing real,

19:17.539 --> 19:19.039
was the danger.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.730
-Boy, you cannot roll upon me like that.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.240
What the fuck are you doing?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.500
When did you even get in town? You didn't call a ***

19:26.509 --> 19:30.269
-Tina, relax, all right? You good.
-Weird ass.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.940
-How about you just open the door,

19:32.140 --> 19:34.762
invite me in, offer a *** a drink or something,

19:34.762 --> 19:36.859
then hit me with all the questions?

19:38.039 --> 19:40.170
Because I got a few I need answers for myself.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.940
-You weird.

19:45.039 --> 19:46.480
Now tell me why you're really here,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.808
because you don't never just pop up on me.

19:57.983 --> 20:02.592
-

20:02.592 --> 20:08.172
-

20:08.172 --> 20:10.172
-

20:16.700 --> 20:19.588
-Steal from me ever again, bitch.

20:38.839 --> 20:40.960
-Hello?
I'm downstairs, baby.

20:43.538 --> 20:47.190
Shit, Tariq, I got a crazy headache right now.

20:47.190 --> 20:49.059
Give me a minute to get myself together, okay?

20:49.640 --> 20:53.059
Your food is getting cold. Come on.
-Okay, baby.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.059
-Hi. Yes, I have a guest in the lobby waiting for me.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.940
You can let him up.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.858
Thank you.

21:50.940 --> 21:54.769
-Hey baby, you trying to tell me something
with the tampons on your counter?

21:55.140 --> 21:57.269
-Oh, my bad, babe. I forgot to put them away.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.240
-It's on again, huh?

21:59.640 --> 22:01.359
-Every month, like a rent payment.

22:01.369 --> 22:04.769
-Speaking of rent. Mm, come here.

22:05.539 --> 22:08.170
How many more months I gotta pay before I get my key?

22:11.440 --> 22:13.859
Hey, the down payment should count for something.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.170
-The down payment was your gift to me.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.775
The year's worth of rent is you earning the key.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.960
-Really?
-That was the deal.

22:23.839 --> 22:26.569
Come on, let's bless this food and be thankful.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.170
-All right, let's bless this food. I'm hungry.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.940
Thank you for this food.
-

22:31.140 --> 22:33.170
Amen. Okay.

22:39.740 --> 22:54.670


22:59.440 --> 23:04.279
-Tina, who did this to you?
Tina. Talk to me.

23:04.289 --> 23:07.559
-Who hurt you like this?
-Shit.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.670
Chris found out I was ripping his cheap ass off.

23:15.539 --> 23:18.213
-For a minute, I thought you was going to say
he found out you had--

23:18.213 --> 23:20.859
-Oh, no, bitch, I would be dead. You hear me?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.769
-No, don't put that thought in my damn head.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.349
I thought you promised me you was gonna stop
stealing from that man,

23:28.236 --> 23:30.670
'specially after he coughed up that damn abortion money.

23:31.039 --> 23:33.364
-Bitch, I had my fingers crossed tighter than my pussy hole

23:33.364 --> 23:34.864
when I made that promise.

23:35.339 --> 23:38.680
-Tina.
-Besides, it's not even like I stole from the ***.

23:38.690 --> 23:42.059
I just used his card a couple of times. Oh, petty ass ***.

23:48.140 --> 23:51.910
-How did we get here?
-Bitch, I live here.

23:51.970 --> 23:55.460
And I'm assuming you drove,
or did your lazy ass take a Uber?

23:56.839 --> 23:59.059
-I don't mean get here like, get here, literally.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.355
I mean, like, just yesterday,
I had the number one draft pick in my pocket,

24:02.355 --> 24:04.559
and you had the middleweight champion in yours.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.960
Now today, that shit is all gone

24:07.539 --> 24:09.039
and in the worst way.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.670
-You know what all this is telling me, sis?

24:12.440 --> 24:14.220
-What? That karma's a bitch?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.859
-No, fuck karma. She ain't a bigger bitch than me.

24:18.440 --> 24:22.059
It's telling me it's time to switch up the play
-How so?

24:23.839 --> 24:25.339
Remember white boy Derek?

24:26.839 --> 24:30.170
Yeah. White boy Derek
and his even whiter brother, Terry.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.559
-He's been trying to get me to come out LA
for a while now.

24:35.539 --> 24:39.170
I say we go. Rob us a Kardashian or something.

24:49.339 --> 24:53.460
-All right, I'm with it.
-I love you, sis.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.269
-Love you too, Tina.

25:00.339 --> 25:03.279
See, to really understand Tina's mindset,

25:03.339 --> 25:05.859
you gotta understand where she got that shit from.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.940
-Troy.

25:12.893 --> 25:14.393
Troy. 

25:25.740 --> 25:27.460
You ain't gonna keep ignoring me in my house.

25:30.339 --> 25:33.559
Man, it'll be quick. Just do it for three minutes.

25:34.839 --> 25:37.769
-Gary, you're my mom's boyfriend.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.740
No.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.269
-But you did it to the boyfriend before me.

25:43.619 --> 25:47.059
-He raped me, you sick fuck.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.440
-See, I ain't gonna rape you.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.559
I'm gonna give you something in return.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.940
Give me something,

25:54.740 --> 25:56.240
I'm gonna give you something.

25:56.339 --> 25:58.170
Hm? It's called a fair exchange.

26:00.539 --> 26:02.960
See, I let you and your mom stay in my house

26:03.640 --> 26:05.140
because I like both of y'all.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.269
Anything you ask me for, I give it to you, right?

26:09.140 --> 26:12.859
Buy you clothes, food, I even give you money.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.960
I'm askin' you for one little funky thing.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.740
You're gonna call me out my name.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.440
I know you want this money.

26:35.339 --> 26:37.269
They say what you become as an adult

26:37.640 --> 26:39.140
was nurtured as a child...

26:43.740 --> 26:45.670
 good or bad.

26:46.539 --> 26:48.269
You told me yourself, the boy is gay.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.670
But he's a child, he's my child.

26:55.339 --> 26:57.491
What? What? What, you think you're doing?

26:57.491 --> 27:00.891
I'm calling the police. That's what the hell I'm doing.

27:01.822 --> 27:03.834
You trying to send me back to prison?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.500
-

27:47.039 --> 27:50.269
Ever since then, Troy, now Tina,

27:50.640 --> 27:52.140
has been on her own.

27:52.539 --> 27:56.460
And every day it's been either one
of two things for her,

27:58.039 --> 27:59.611
sink...

28:01.203 --> 28:02.703
... or swim.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.200
-So is this the strip?

28:19.200 --> 28:21.269
-Yeah, this is Sunset Boulevard.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.549
Going up there is the Hollywood Boulevard sign. Beautiful.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.890
-They had that store you like.
-Yeah.

28:29.019 --> 28:31.170
-Well, enough about that, we have a plane to catch.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.670
-We just landed here.

28:34.039 --> 28:36.690
-Derek and I have some business to tend to in Mexico.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.059
-Mexico?
-Mexico.

28:40.253 --> 28:45.451
-Oh, shit. Mexico.
-Mexico.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.990
-I mean, we are a long ways from home,
and I ain't talking sky miles.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.559
I mean, look how far we came, sis. Sis?

29:02.140 --> 29:05.059
It is a leave him on read type of week, honey.

29:05.539 --> 29:07.039
Lo siento

29:13.740 --> 29:15.738
-I love your car.

29:21.539 --> 29:23.460
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

29:27.339 --> 29:28.839
-Well, we're here.

29:29.539 --> 29:32.670
The bedrooms are upstairs, so enjoy yourselves.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.250
Terry and I have a meeting,

29:34.250 --> 29:36.569
and we'll be back in a few hours to have dinner.

29:36.799 --> 29:38.299
-Thanks, babe.
-Thank you.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.740
-See you in a minute.
-We'll see you.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.940
-Bye.

29:44.039 --> 29:47.269
-So they want us to talk about
three of the other proposals that they had.

29:47.940 --> 29:49.440
I think it'll be okay...

29:50.940 --> 29:53.076
-Bitch!
-Bitch.

29:53.076 --> 29:54.743
-Give me my phone right now.

29:54.743 --> 29:56.243
-You ain't getting no phone.
-Stop playin'.

30:07.299 --> 30:10.531
# Who be that bitch right there dipped in Gucci

30:10.531 --> 30:13.363
# Havin' **** starin' and make his bitch get noosey

30:13.363 --> 30:15.900
# And I start airin' if you interfere my loose leaf

30:15.900 --> 30:18.619
# Get goofy, three clips, this not a movie

30:18.630 --> 30:21.794
# Let a real **** keep the La Perla on my coochie

30:21.794 --> 30:23.519
#No cooties, crib poppin' with different hoochies

30:24.411 --> 30:26.900
# 10 doobies, 10 bitches in the Jacuzzi

30:26.900 --> 30:28.920
#Bunch of groupies, Netflix & Chill, moody

30:29.799 --> 30:32.582
#That's fly shit, gotta keep a couple different options

30:32.582 --> 30:34.089
#In the Saks Fifth, Nieman Marcus when I'm shoppin'

30:35.000 --> 30:37.720
# Dripping so much they waiting for me to drop it

30:37.730 --> 30:40.661
# Streets watchin', give 'em somethin' that they can vibe with

30:40.740 --> 30:42.440
# Give these hoes somethin' they can gossip

30:43.442 --> 30:46.539
# Give 'em somethin' fresh up out the closet

30:46.549 --> 30:48.799
# When these bitches see you, make 'em vomit

30:48.900 --> 30:50.859
# On top, keep bitches in all pockets

30:51.039 --> 30:53.881
# Yeah, it's been a long time since a chick like me

30:53.881 --> 30:56.136
# Came in the game, spittin' shit like me

30:56.136 --> 30:58.136
# They know my name, ain't no bitch like me

30:58.136 --> 31:02.097
# They know who I be, ain't no playin' with me,
ain't no playin' with me

31:02.097 --> 31:02.136
# Yeah, it's been a long time since a chick like me

31:02.136 --> 31:04.136
# Came in the game, spittin' shit like me

31:04.136 --> 31:06.934
# Came in the game, spittin' shit like me...

31:13.099 --> 31:15.700
# I'm that young bitch with that Chanel swag

31:15.868 --> 31:18.420
# I set my feature price higher than a Chanel tag...

31:18.500 --> 31:23.371
-Bitch, this is a boat.
-No, this is a house on water.

31:23.371 --> 31:25.460
-No, no, no, Look, look, look.
Come here, come here, look.

31:25.839 --> 31:27.670
This motherfucker can move.

31:28.740 --> 31:31.559
-Oh, shit. I think you're right.

31:32.240 --> 31:36.299
-Oh, my God, this is dope. Wow, I could get used to this.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.190
-Uh huh.

31:39.740 --> 31:43.099
-And my mama said no good would come to me
if I lived life as a girl.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.786
-Lies. I learned a long time ago,

31:44.786 --> 31:47.767
you get way more with a pussy than with a dick,

31:47.767 --> 31:48.920
and that's on a period.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.170
Cheers to that.
-Shit.

32:05.039 --> 32:09.099
#  Honey, the most tears I have

32:09.200 --> 32:12.170
# Are welling up inside

32:13.140 --> 32:16.559
#  Can make her feel like wow

32:17.039 --> 32:18.960
#  This ain't a time to try

32:20.839 --> 32:24.170
#  So I convinced my self

32:25.039 --> 32:26.960
#  Put you on a shelf

32:29.339 --> 32:33.994
#  Hoping that this would fade away

32:33.994 --> 32:35.994
#  You stay stuck in my mind

32:37.337 --> 32:38.837
#  Even though I ran away from you

32:39.588 --> 32:42.141
#  Oh and I tried...

32:53.240 --> 32:56.860
#  I sit around and wonder sometime

32:57.039 --> 33:00.670
#  What it would be like if we crossed that line

33:01.440 --> 33:02.700
#  No, it ain't wrong.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.769
#  No, it ain't a crime

33:05.339 --> 33:08.839
#  That you send chills right through my spine

33:08.839 --> 33:10.839
#  I don't wan't....

33:21.900 --> 33:25.220
#  You stay stuck in my mind

33:25.220 --> 33:27.537
# Even through I ran away from you

33:28.539 --> 33:48.170
#  Each time that I tried...

33:48.839 --> 33:52.000
# It only pushes me to face the truth

33:52.000 --> 33:56.640
#  I love you

33:56.640 --> 33:58.140
#  Stuck in my mind

33:58.339 --> 34:16.360
#  You're stuck in my mind... 

34:17.340 --> 34:19.059
-You're truly incredible, you know that?

34:19.940 --> 34:23.170
-Mm. No, not as incredible as you, baby.

34:24.239 --> 34:27.599
-No, seriously.

34:27.780 --> 34:32.260
Sometimes you break something inside of yourself
and you, you can never fix it.

34:33.239 --> 34:37.039
Then you meet someone,
and they put the pieces together

34:37.039 --> 34:39.969
you thought were missing.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.170
I can be myself around you in private

34:45.840 --> 34:47.969
and avoid being judged in public.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.670
You're so special to me.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.340
Are you happy?

35:02.239 --> 35:07.670
-If you're happy, I'm even happier, Mr. Derek Rossi.
-I am so happy.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.170
Celess, I know what's there.

35:18.940 --> 35:21.760
I'm sure Tina has told you what my brother and I are into.

35:47.699 --> 35:50.760
-So, I heard you blew Terri's back out last night.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.630
-Bitch, hush before somebody hear your ass.

35:52.630 --> 35:55.170
Don't you ever repeat no shit like that again, either.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.239
-Excuse me.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.940
Your breath smells like shit.

36:00.230 --> 36:02.269
See, he don't even understand English.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.409
So, like I was saying,

36:03.409 --> 36:04.960
I heard you packing down there.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.610
-Fuck you, Tina.

36:06.610 --> 36:09.550
-Anytime, bitch. Anytime

36:09.929 --> 36:39.050


36:41.500 --> 36:46.489
-You guys love cigars.
-Thank you.

36:46.510 --> 36:54.250
-Derek, Terry. It's been a long time, man. Si.

36:54.730 --> 36:57.239
Yeah. I hope you're enjoying the house, no?

36:57.250 --> 37:00.500
-It's wonderful, Jose. Thank you, brother.
-That's it.

37:01.289 --> 37:03.677
-You're certainly the man of the hour.
- Gracias.

37:03.677 --> 37:07.139
-I'd like you to meet our beautiful ladies, Celess and Tina,

37:07.619 --> 37:09.460
-Tina.
-Pleasure to meet you.

37:11.204 --> 37:12.630
-Celess.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.130
-Celess.

37:14.762 --> 37:16.969
Beautiful is an understatement,  mi amigos.
-Thank you.

37:18.099 --> 37:25.159
-And to think all this time I thought the two of you were fags.

37:25.630 --> 37:30.400
-This guy's a billionaire and still chooses to do stand up.
Unbelievable.

37:30.590 --> 37:34.289
Please excuse myself.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.670
-Sure.
-I need to tend to other clients.

37:36.679 --> 37:38.360
If you have any questions, please feel free.

37:38.369 --> 37:42.050
-Gracias hermano.

37:43.630 --> 37:48.250
-Paul Rodriguez, watch out.

37:49.130 --> 37:53.039
-This is gorgeous. Shall we proceed to the outside?
-We should.

38:01.119 --> 38:04.831
-Wow. These views never get old.
- Nice, isn't it?

38:04.831 --> 38:06.449
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.250
-Terry, this is remarkable.
-Beautiful, beautiful.

38:16.019 --> 38:17.090
-It's a beautiful view.

38:17.090 --> 38:19.750
And if you get tired of it,
you can just pull her around and change it.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.340
-Oh, so you was right, sis, it is a boat.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.650
-Right is an understatement,  mi amigo,

38:28.420 --> 38:32.900
-Some people call it a houseboat for the affluent,
others, a floating mansion,

38:33.019 --> 38:34.949
but it's one of a kind, for sure.

38:35.320 --> 38:39.650
-For now, Derek. It's one of a kind for now.

38:40.420 --> 38:43.070
-Yes. So what's happening is that Terry and I

38:43.070 --> 38:46.539
have been asked by Jose to create more of these vessels.

38:47.219 --> 38:48.960
-Wow. Impressive.

38:48.969 --> 38:50.469
-Nice.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.650
-Yes. Jose, who owns this--

38:52.659 --> 38:56.769
-This boat or this, excuse me, this floating mansion.

38:56.780 --> 38:59.840
-No, he owns this city, honey.

39:00.619 --> 39:04.464
-Why, of course he owns the city.
I mean, God, this guy's rich.

39:05.099 --> 39:06.949
-Jose's wife doesn't want for anything.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.750
-I can only imagine.
-You don't have to imagine.

39:11.619 --> 39:13.449
This is the kind of life I want for you.

39:15.719 --> 39:17.219
-Okay?
-Okay.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.500
-I know we've known each other
just for a short period of time,

39:28.500 --> 39:34.300
but you're my dream come true.

39:34.460 --> 39:35.960
When you wake up tomorrow,

39:38.019 --> 39:41.449
I want you to know I'm going to be by your side,
holding your hand.

39:43.719 --> 39:47.949
I love you for who you are, and the way I am with you.

39:50.719 --> 39:56.750
I want to share the precious time of life with you, always.

40:00.409 --> 40:03.030
-What you doing?

40:05.800 --> 40:08.739
-Tina Marie Price--
-What are you doing?

40:12.425 --> 40:15.530
-Will you be my wife?
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

40:16.210 --> 40:17.710
My God.

40:19.809 --> 40:25.699
-Oh, my God. It's so beautiful. Yes. Yes, Derek Antonio Rossi.

40:25.710 --> 40:30.310
I'll be your wife forever. I got you.

40:36.510 --> 40:39.530
Oh, my God.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.000
-Are you crazy?

40:44.001 --> 40:46.889
You only 22 years old, and you barely know that damn man.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.880
And besides, ain't you always the one

40:48.880 --> 40:51.699
that said fairy tales like this don't exist for girls like us?

40:51.710 --> 40:53.340
-Shh, lower your voice.

40:53.340 --> 40:55.289
-I thought they couldn't understand
what we were saying.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.139
-That's the butler, smart ass.

40:58.510 --> 41:01.599
-Seriously, though, all I know is if you marry that man,

41:01.610 --> 41:03.650
you're gonna have a long distance marriage

41:03.659 --> 41:06.010
because I know you ain't about to move your ass to LA

41:06.010 --> 41:08.400
and leave me in Atlanta to fend for myself.

41:08.409 --> 41:10.809
-Look, first of all, calm down, sis.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.030
And second of all, remember when I said
it was time to switch up the play?

41:14.610 --> 41:16.369
Well, this is what I was talking about.

41:16.369 --> 41:19.250
I mean, when are we ever gonna catch this big again,

41:19.250 --> 41:21.239
with people who know what's up with us?

41:21.710 --> 41:25.139
-We? You saying we like you booked me a flight to France.

41:26.210 --> 41:26.909
-God.

41:26.909 --> 41:31.230
Me marrying Derek puts you in automatic position
with Terry, don't you see that?

41:31.809 --> 41:34.059
-Position where? I don't like that damn position.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.698
I damn sure don't want to be in it

41:35.698 --> 41:37.010
because that involves me bending that *** over

41:37.010 --> 41:39.829
when I should be the one with my face down
and my ass up, not him.

41:40.210 --> 41:42.739
-You are so picky, it is pathetic.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.409
-Well, ain't that the thot calling the kettle black?

41:45.550 --> 41:49.119
-Listen, I am sick and tired of nickel and diming these ***

41:49.119 --> 41:50.619
with their unpredictable asses.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.099
One minute they blowing a bag on you at Phipps,

41:53.099 --> 41:55.929
and the next minute they calling for you
to put money on their books.

41:55.940 --> 42:00.429
Now it's time to put down the shovel,
honey, and pick up the silver spoon.

42:02.099 --> 42:05.230
I gotta admit, Tina was goals.

42:05.699 --> 42:09.730
I mean, anything to not have to return
to the struggle from which we came.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.869
-Now, listen, remember when I pull off,
take a picture of his license plate,

42:15.869 --> 42:19.309
and if I'm going more than 30 minutes,
bitch, you already know what to do.

42:19.320 --> 42:21.192
-Wait, remind me why we're doing this shit again.

42:21.192 --> 42:23.730
-Um, so we don't be homeless, so we don't be hungry.

42:24.099 --> 42:26.099
-Okay, so why I can't just get a job.

42:26.110 --> 42:27.610
-You try putting Charles on the application

42:28.000 --> 42:29.940
and showing up as Celess and see how far that gets you.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.730
Now, remember what I said,

42:32.199 --> 42:33.929
and stay here so I can take your picture.

42:37.699 --> 42:41.043
Hey, handsome.
Hey, what's up?

42:44.599 --> 43:30.599


43:30.599 --> 43:32.820
-Damn, so that's what it takes to get a call back from you.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.300
A *** had to repot the whip.

43:36.099 --> 43:39.019
-So it was you who took my car and not some petty car thief?

43:39.699 --> 43:41.199
-Damn right it was me.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.929
I ain't heard from you,
so I had to check the tracker on the whip.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.230
Like damn shorty go out of town,
you can't even tell a *** bye.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.429
-My bad. Oh, Tina popped up with a girl's trip

43:51.440 --> 43:53.179
and she bought the ticket and paid for everything.

43:53.179 --> 43:55.519
So there's no way I could have turned that down.

43:55.530 --> 43:57.820
And as soon as we landed,
she took my phone from me.

43:58.699 --> 44:00.219
-Well, I'm already at your crib, baby.

44:01.489 --> 44:03.309
-All right, I'm leaving the airport now.

44:04.489 --> 44:08.010
-All right, well, I'll pull up on you,
and you can make it up to me later.

44:09.889 --> 44:12.420
-All right, Give me about an hour. I'll be there.

44:18.090 --> 44:19.809
Uh, what's up baby?

44:20.690 --> 44:23.809
Damn, that's the kind of hug I get after all this time?

44:24.190 --> 44:27.429
-You just smell like weed and it's strong as hell, that's it.

44:27.670 --> 44:30.920
-What's up with you, man?
-Nothing.

44:31.690 --> 44:34.920
Between that flight and the time change,
it just got me jet lagged.

44:36.489 --> 44:37.989
Yeah, but why you fronting?

44:38.289 --> 44:39.920
What, you got another *** or something?

44:40.690 --> 44:42.420
Who you went on that trip with, for real?

44:42.889 --> 44:45.809
O, chill. You're talking out your ass and you high as fuck.

44:46.190 --> 44:48.010
You want some water or something?
-Nah,

44:50.889 --> 44:54.309
But I do want you to wet this dick, though.
-My period on

44:54.690 --> 44:56.219
Oh, really?

45:07.389 --> 45:10.420
Then how come I don't see the blood plugs on the bathroom sink, then?

45:10.789 --> 45:12.289
-A bitch can't clean up?

45:15.489 --> 45:16.989
So this what we're doing now?

45:18.889 --> 45:23.420
You disappear on me for a week,
then pretend like you got a period.

45:25.219 --> 45:26.719
You know, stop playing with me.

45:27.889 --> 45:29.389
Hold on, babe.

45:30.690 --> 45:35.219
Now, don't be scared. I been knew what it was.

45:37.289 --> 45:39.920
It's cool, though, I'm with it.

45:49.690 --> 45:54.650
-Oh, my fucking God, bitch! You are lying.
-Titty swear, bitch.

45:54.659 --> 45:57.920
-You know, it never crossed my mind that O was trade.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.329
Okay, so give me all the details.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.460
What happened afterwards?

46:01.460 --> 46:04.000
Did he stay or did he skate up out of there in shame?

46:04.679 --> 46:08.130
-No, bitch, he stayed. We watched a whole movie.

46:08.139 --> 46:10.312
We had Uber eats bring us some shrimp and grits

46:10.312 --> 46:12.710
and you know a bitch love shrimp and grits.

46:13.079 --> 46:14.909
And then we spoke about being exclusive.

46:15.579 --> 46:18.409
He would have spent the night,
but he had some business to tend to.

46:18.980 --> 46:21.530
-Oh, bitch, won't he do it?

46:21.539 --> 46:23.909
I can hear Deon Cole in my head.

46:23.920 --> 46:26.099
You giving God the wrong glory.

46:26.579 --> 46:28.829
-But, like, look at us and look at the timing.

46:28.829 --> 46:32.349
We both have men who know and accept us
for who the fuck we really are.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.989
And they take good care of us.

46:33.989 --> 46:35.500
Now, that is a blessing.

46:36.079 --> 46:40.000
-Facts, especially since I ain't got you
to run the streets with anymore.

46:40.880 --> 46:45.360
And besides, if I had to pick any *** to be with,
it would definitely be O,

46:45.369 --> 46:49.250
he's fine as fuck. He's 100% my type.

46:49.260 --> 46:52.219
He puts the D on me like nobody else.

46:52.230 --> 46:54.090
And he ain't stingy with them racks.

46:54.099 --> 46:57.409
-From hoes to housewives.
No more pussy stuntin' in the club.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.019
No more riskin' our lives getting close to these ***

47:00.030 --> 47:01.280
And no more fucking begging

47:01.280 --> 47:03.500
because these *** getting cheaper by the dozen, honey,

47:03.880 --> 47:07.099
I know, but it just seems so surreal.

47:07.579 --> 47:09.206
Like, if somebody would have told me a month ago

47:09.206 --> 47:11.468
that me and you would be in this place right now,

47:11.468 --> 47:13.320
like, I would have told him they cappin

47:13.329 --> 47:17.221
-Exactly. right. Like today I was looking at wedding invitations.

47:17.400 --> 47:22.210
Me, Tina, true player, for real. Fuck a fuck boy for real.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.469
While we're on the subject, is O your plus one?

47:26.480 --> 47:29.300
-I don't know. He is my man now.

47:30.079 --> 47:32.380
Oh, I'm so hyped. Oh, my God.

47:32.380 --> 47:35.167
Okay, look out for your wedding invitation in the mail.

47:35.167 --> 47:37.739
I gotta go because Derek booked us dinner reservations
at Mr. Chows,

47:37.750 --> 47:41.800
and I'm trying to prove to him
that not all black people are always late.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.539
-All right, bitch, be safe.

47:44.539 --> 47:47.409
-I love you.
- I love you, too, hoe.

47:50.179 --> 47:54.099
<i> For the first time in a long time,
things felt really good.</i>

47:54.880 --> 47:56.380
<i> Almost too good.</i>

47:57.480 --> 48:04.053
<i>Well, when things felt too good to be true,
they usually fucking were.</i>

48:16.170 --> 48:19.500
-Hey, yo, let's make this shit quick, all right?
-All right. Say less.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.420
Yo, wassup? You reached the voice message of O.

49:01.719 --> 49:04.500
At the tone, please leave me a detailed message.

49:05.469 --> 49:07.510
-O, it's me again.

49:07.519 --> 49:09.330
Look, I don't know what kind of games you playing,

49:09.330 --> 49:10.673
or if this is supposed to be pay back

49:10.673 --> 49:12.400
for that week I went without calling you,

49:12.409 --> 49:14.304
but I'm gonna need to hear back from you

49:14.304 --> 49:15.639
before I confirm you for Tina's wedding.

49:15.639 --> 49:18.789
I don't want her paying for no flight
and you ain't going. Call me back.

49:21.170 --> 49:23.590
Yo, wassup? You reached the voice message of O.

49:23.969 --> 49:26.789
 At the tone, please leave me a detailed message. 

49:27.269 --> 49:29.202
-Yo, this is getting real corny.

49:29.202 --> 49:32.239
Just FYI, if you don't hit me back by tomorrow.

49:32.239 --> 49:33.739
I'm just gonna take it that you ain't coming.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.590
-Tariq, what the fuck?
- Well, hello to you, too.

50:09.247 --> 50:10.747
I didn't mean to scare you.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.260
Been worried sick about you

50:12.559 --> 50:15.079
-Worried for what? And how the fuck did you get up here?

50:15.659 --> 50:17.159
What do you mean, worried for what?

50:17.760 --> 50:20.690
Last time I saw you ran out here
because somebody beat up on Tina.

50:21.460 --> 50:24.489
Then I don't hear from you for a week.
I didn't know what to think.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.190
-So you break into my fucking house?

50:28.260 --> 50:29.760
-Relax, all right?

50:29.860 --> 50:33.320
I went to the management office,
I asked them to give me access.

50:33.329 --> 50:35.190
I'm a co signer, so they gave me a key.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.489
-Okay, well, now you see all is well.

50:37.489 --> 50:40.389
Put the key on the bed and go on about your day.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.260
-What did you say to me?

50:42.460 --> 50:45.280
-Tariq, get out of my house.
-Are you on something?

50:46.360 --> 50:47.900
Why are you talking to me like this?

50:47.909 --> 50:51.309
-Don't take another step closer
unless it's out that goddamn door

50:51.320 --> 50:56.690
-Celess, it's me. Why you acting like I'm an intruder,
like some stranger.

50:57.159 --> 50:58.585
Now, either you come out of that tub,

50:58.585 --> 51:01.599
and come and talk like you got some sense,
or I'm jumping in there with you.

51:01.610 --> 51:03.320
You're not gonna be disrespecting me like this.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.280
-Tariq, I got HIV.

51:11.159 --> 51:13.389
That's why I was avoiding you all this time.

51:13.860 --> 51:16.780
And that's why I want you gone for your own good.

51:20.576 --> 51:22.579
All right, I hear you.

51:24.460 --> 51:27.690
There's no way I know how you feel,
or what you're going through right now,

51:28.460 --> 51:30.280
but I know I deserved to be told better than this.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.840
-Here comes the bride.
She better not be dressed in white.

51:51.799 --> 51:55.989
-My bitch flew all the way to LA just for me.
Makeup alert.

51:57.260 --> 51:59.840
And you is flawless, too, bitch.

51:59.849 --> 52:01.719
-You looking beat yourself.

52:01.730 --> 52:03.230
Yes.

52:03.550 --> 52:05.349
Um, where's your plus one?

52:05.349 --> 52:07.659
Because I expected to see him in a suit, not you.

52:07.679 --> 52:09.269
-Is that supposed to be shade?

52:10.050 --> 52:13.039
I don't know. I just wanted to try something different,
you know?

52:13.050 --> 52:16.679
How would it look walking your ass down the aisle
if we both got gowns on.

52:17.050 --> 52:18.880
They would have looked at us like who wore it better.

52:20.250 --> 52:23.289
And besides, I am killing this damn suit.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.230
-I don't know what you're talking about.

52:25.239 --> 52:29.880
You know I was playing because you look bomb.
Yes.

52:31.650 --> 52:33.429
-Oh, there you are.

52:33.429 --> 52:35.300
-Babe what are you doing? You're not supposed to see me yet.

52:35.530 --> 52:36.719
-Oh, then I'm not looking.

52:36.719 --> 52:40.070
-You're lucky I'm not in my dress yet.
-Well, then I am looking.

52:40.550 --> 52:42.380
Boy, get out of here.

52:43.050 --> 52:47.480
-Celess, you have a minute?
-Sure.

52:49.550 --> 52:53.570
-Terry told me he saw you come in.
You look great.

52:54.750 --> 52:56.250
-Thank you. Derek,

52:57.349 --> 52:59.579
-I know you weren't happy at the proposal,

52:59.590 --> 53:01.769
so thank you for giving us your blessing.

53:02.849 --> 53:05.480
And thank you for walking Tina down the aisle.

53:06.550 --> 53:10.380
It means a lot to us.
-I appreciate that, Derek.

53:12.050 --> 53:15.199
Tina means the world to me, and so does her happiness.

53:15.210 --> 53:19.980
And you honestly do make her happy, so thank you.

53:20.650 --> 53:23.559
Well, with that being said, ladies, I'll let you get to it.

53:24.059 --> 53:25.559
The guests are arriving.

53:31.650 --> 53:35.579
-Bitch, I still can't believe your ass is getting married.

53:35.590 --> 53:38.429
-Bitch, you are next.

53:38.429 --> 53:42.358
Okay, speaking of which,
so what's really going on with O,

53:42.699 --> 53:45.070
because Derek told me you only asked for one plane ticket?

53:45.650 --> 53:47.489
-I don't know. That *** ghosting me.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.269
-Wait, what? But I thought--

53:51.250 --> 53:52.969
Are you sure he was really down with that?

53:52.969 --> 53:55.679
Because you know how *** get
when they high and horny.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.880
-That's the same thing I asked myself.

53:59.949 --> 54:03.260
But he was sober by the time he left,
and everything still seemed cool.

54:04.139 --> 54:07.469
-Are you sure he's all right?
Did you call the hospitals or the jails?

54:08.739 --> 54:11.280
-He's fine. He's just acting like a dick.

54:11.289 --> 54:14.329
He probably still tight from that week
that we took in Mexico,

54:14.329 --> 54:15.860
when I ain't answer his calls.

54:16.840 --> 54:19.260
Probably trying to just give me a dose of my own medicine.

54:19.639 --> 54:22.590
-Well, that's whack. First James, now O.

54:22.599 --> 54:25.039
And what's up with Tariq? Is he still trying to get a key?

54:25.050 --> 54:28.969
-Tariq? Bitch, I had to use excuse number three on his ass.

54:29.739 --> 54:32.559
-Bitch, you told him you're HIV positive?

54:34.139 --> 54:38.579
Yeah, you told me to use that excuse for emergencies,
and that was an emergency.

54:38.590 --> 54:42.679
That man walked in my bathroom
when I was ass naked in the damn tub.

54:42.690 --> 54:45.400
That was the only excuse I could used to get his ass
up out of there.

54:45.409 --> 54:50.469
-Oh, shit, you're right. That is an emergency. Damn.

54:51.139 --> 54:55.039
But enough of the exes and the O's.

54:55.039 --> 55:01.559
Bitch, it's yo day, sis.
Now let's get you in this amazing ass gown.

55:03.539 --> 55:07.230
Yes, bitch, so I can hand you over
to your Prince Charming.

55:07.239 --> 55:12.283
-Help me! Help me. 
-Oh, or should I say King Charming?

55:13.099 --> 55:16.800
Because we both know that ***
is too old to be a goddamn prince.

55:16.809 --> 55:20.260
- You always with the shade.

55:30.539 --> 55:33.260
My head was no longer at Tina's wedding.

55:33.269 --> 55:39.260
It was back in Atlanta, wondering if O was okay.

55:39.639 --> 55:43.949
-Hi, yes. I'm calling because I wanted to see

55:43.949 --> 55:47.570
if an Omar Robinson has been admitted in the hospital.

55:47.570 --> 55:50.980
I was told to call all the hospitals in the area.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.320
We don't have an Omar Robinson here,

55:53.329 --> 55:55.969
and I hate to tell you this,
but if he's been missing a while,

55:56.340 --> 56:00.550
you may want to check the morgue.

56:11.829 --> 56:13.965
-Don't tell me you had that dream again.

56:13.965 --> 56:17.849
-I wish it was a dream, Tina. O's dead.

56:20.030 --> 56:22.980
O's death hit different.

56:22.989 --> 56:26.225
It dug up a familiar pain from a moment in my life

56:26.225 --> 56:28.849
I've been trying to bury since the day it happened,

56:30.130 --> 56:35.550
Three years, hormone pills, laser treatments,
and two boob jobs later,

56:35.789 --> 56:39.670
I decided to make amends with my mom
or, at the very least,

56:39.670 --> 56:43.050
say goodbye to her before I followed Tina to Atlanta.

56:49.730 --> 56:52.349
-Can I help you?
-Hi.

56:57.429 --> 56:59.280
-Honey, I'm not interested in anything you're selling.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.250
It's my day off. Have a blessed day.

57:13.229 --> 57:15.619
Once I realized that my own mom couldn't accept me,

57:15.630 --> 57:17.699
I made my mind up that no one would.

57:17.710 --> 57:23.550
So it was eat or be eaten,
and then O changed all of that.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.159
-I'm so sorry, friend.

57:27.730 --> 57:29.659
Tina was a real one. Period.

57:30.130 --> 57:32.550
She put her honeymoon on hold to come see about me.

57:36.929 --> 57:40.050
-I just want to know why God is torturing me.

57:41.630 --> 57:46.659
It's bad enough that I have to go through life
in a body that I don't belong in,

57:47.230 --> 57:50.960
in a world that makes me feel like I don't belong in it.

57:51.730 --> 57:56.050
But right when he sends me somebody
who makes me feel like I belong,

57:56.429 --> 57:58.659
he takes him away.

57:59.130 --> 58:01.449
And tragically, at that.

58:02.219 --> 58:05.650
Like why, God? Why me?

58:06.820 --> 58:10.650
What the fuck did I do to deserve this shit?
-All right, enough.

58:11.219 --> 58:13.519
Because the same God you questioning right now, sis,

58:13.519 --> 58:16.199
is the same God you thank for everything the fuck else.

58:16.210 --> 58:17.940
You live a good life.

58:18.420 --> 58:21.340
So please don't even start going down that rabbit hole.

58:21.719 --> 58:23.219
Look at me.

58:24.119 --> 58:28.340
The slightest touch of depression
could be very dangerous for girls like us.

58:28.820 --> 58:30.320
Trust me, okay?

58:30.719 --> 58:33.760
I'm gonna need you to get up out this bed,
go in the shower, clean up,

58:33.760 --> 58:37.250
put on some clean pajamas, and hurry up because Claudia is on her way.

58:37.719 --> 58:39.539
-Claudia, your cleaning lady?

58:39.920 --> 58:43.449
-Yes. I called her a soon as I got off the plane. Come on.

58:44.320 --> 58:47.840
Sis, you didn't have to do that.
-Bitch, look around.

58:48.619 --> 58:50.539
Come on. Time is money.

58:51.920 --> 58:54.539
Come on. She's on the way.
-Tina.

58:55.420 --> 58:58.949
Tina was right. I did have God to thank.

58:59.719 --> 59:01.250
Especially for a friend like her.

59:01.820 --> 59:03.320
-You're gonna be all right.

59:03.519 --> 59:07.150
She may have had a cold heart,
but it was pure gold.

59:15.119 --> 59:18.340
-Sis, what you're trying to eat?

59:19.119 --> 59:21.019
-I don't even have an appetite

59:21.030 --> 59:22.886
-Uh-uh, for the sake of all the hard work

59:22.886 --> 59:24.949
you put into this banging body, you need to eat.

59:25.619 --> 59:27.750
And plus, you losing a little jiggle back here.

59:28.719 --> 59:30.840
-Really?
-For real, for real.

59:33.119 --> 59:36.039
-All right. Well just order me
whatever it is you're ordering yourself

59:37.019 --> 59:38.750
-I knew I'll make your ass eat.

59:39.719 --> 59:41.219
No pun intended.

59:41.519 --> 59:43.449
Hi. Yes, I'd like to place a to go order.

59:45.820 --> 59:52.679
Yes, I'd like to have two Salmon Kabob dinners,
swap the salad for French fries.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.449
-Kabob Land?
-Yes. Keep the rice.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.670
-Get some extra sauce.

59:57.670 --> 1:00:00.030
-Yes. And can we please have extra sauce in the bag?

1:00:01.309 --> 1:00:03.329
10 -15 minutes. Okay, thank you.

1:00:05.010 --> 1:00:09.030
That's one thing I miss about Atlanta,
I love my little food spots.

1:00:10.510 --> 1:00:13.409
So now I got you fed, let's get you back eating, okay?

1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:15.639
You said your car note and your rent is due next week?

1:00:16.809 --> 1:00:19.139
-Tina, I just can't believe he's gone,

1:00:21.309 --> 1:00:25.139
and how they did him. It's just so fucked up.

1:00:25.610 --> 1:00:30.940
-Look, I hate to say this, sis, but that is just the game.

1:00:31.710 --> 1:00:35.050
There are no winners or losers in this, okay? Look at me.

1:00:35.059 --> 1:00:36.940
There's only corpses and inmates,

1:00:37.510 --> 1:00:39.010
so stop moping.

1:00:39.409 --> 1:00:40.599
It's not good for your skin,

1:00:40.599 --> 1:00:42.099
and that's your money maker.

1:00:42.610 --> 1:00:45.340
Let me see what horse we're gonna bet on today.

1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:48.139
Tina lit a fire under my ass.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.610
I had to stop feeling sorry for myself
and get back to business.

1:00:53.619 --> 1:00:56.300
Because the first of the month was around the corner,

1:00:56.309 --> 1:01:00.829
And ever since my mom forced me to leave her home when I was 15,

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:44.440
I vowed to never be homeless again.

1:01:45.809 --> 1:01:47.309
Make sure you call me.

1:01:53.309 --> 1:01:56.809
In the matter of a week,
I saw a major increase in two things.

1:01:57.010 --> 1:01:58.510
My cash app

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.619
and my blood alcohol level.

1:02:07.699 --> 1:02:09.730
-Are you okay?

1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:14.119
-I'm good. Thank you.
-You don't look good.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.619
-***, you must need glasses.
-No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.690
You look good. You definitely look good.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.519
I was meaning-- Oh, okay. I can't let you drive like this.

1:02:27.530 --> 1:02:29.619
Where you headed?
I can call you an Uber.

1:02:31.300 --> 1:02:34.070
-I'm going home. And I'm not gonna tell you where I live.

1:02:34.070 --> 1:02:35.570
You could be a killer or something.

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:42.119
-I don't want to hurt you.
And I don't want you to hurt yourself

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.300
and--
-

1:02:48.599 --> 1:02:55.019
--and that can happen if I let you drive
in the state that you're in.

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:56.579
-Okay, fine.

1:02:56.579 --> 1:02:58.400
If I tell you, I'm gonna get myself an Uber,

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:00.119
would that make you leave me the hell alone?

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.320
-Sure.
-

1:03:04.599 --> 1:03:06.119
-Okay. Come on. Come on.

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:08.599
-Wait.

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:24.230
Oh, fuck.

1:03:29.199 --> 1:03:30.699
What the hell?

1:03:31.099 --> 1:03:33.429
-How many times do I have to tell you,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.119
The only thing being cut with this are apples and oranges.

1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:41.000
Hope you like omelets.

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:44.230
-I'm sorry. I'm just confused right now,

1:03:44.230 --> 1:03:45.730
but where the hell am I?

1:03:46.099 --> 1:03:48.164
-You're at my house.

1:03:48.164 --> 1:03:50.230
-And you are.

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:54.429
-You don't remember anything from last night?

1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.300
I'm Michael

1:04:00.090 --> 1:04:02.610
-Celess.
-Celess.

1:04:03.090 --> 1:04:07.420
-Somebody dropped you off at your car,
but you were in no position to drive.

1:04:08.090 --> 1:04:09.179
I was gonna wait with you

1:04:09.179 --> 1:04:12.309
while you called an Uber, but you passed out.

1:04:15.289 --> 1:04:20.110
-Tell me this isn't your room.
- No, it's my son's room.

1:04:20.789 --> 1:04:22.309
He's with his mom. it's her week.

1:04:26.489 --> 1:04:27.989
-Did I have this on?

1:04:28.389 --> 1:04:29.889
-No.

1:04:30.590 --> 1:04:32.900
It's not as fashionable as what you had on,

1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:35.110
but I figured it'd be more comfortable.

1:04:37.489 --> 1:04:38.989
-Did you put this on me?

1:04:43.389 --> 1:04:46.559
You wasn't that damn drunk, huh? 

1:04:46.559 --> 1:04:49.610
-He said when it was time to change my clothes,
I sobered up quick.
.

1:04:50.590 --> 1:04:52.090
He didn't try to fuck?

1:04:52.489 --> 1:04:56.920
-Nope. He stayed in his room.
Is he gay?

1:04:58.690 --> 1:05:01.010
-I don't know. I don't get that from him.

1:05:01.590 --> 1:05:03.833
But I agreed to let him take me out

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:06.000
on an official first date tonight, so we'll see.

1:05:06.989 --> 1:05:08.719
Well, let me know how that goes, okay?

1:05:08.719 --> 1:05:11.010
And if I don't answer it's because I'm at the game.

1:05:11.690 --> 1:05:13.809
-Yeah, I got floor seats at the Staples Center.

1:05:14.190 --> 1:05:18.809
-Oh, bitch. Have fun.
-Yes, sis, so just text me.

1:05:19.389 --> 1:05:20.889
-Okay, baby,

1:05:24.590 --> 1:05:30.219
 Namaste.

1:05:30.989 --> 1:05:34.920
So, a son and no wife. How come?

1:05:35.590 --> 1:05:38.719
-Simple answer is we grew apart. How about you?

1:05:39.190 --> 1:05:41.719
You have any kids?
-No.

1:05:43.789 --> 1:05:45.289
-And you're single?

1:05:45.590 --> 1:05:47.809
-Yeah. How come?

1:05:49.489 --> 1:05:52.639
-I don't know. I guess the simple answer is
I haven't found anyone

1:05:52.639 --> 1:05:56.110
that's kept my attention long enough
for me to be in a committed relationship.

1:05:57.789 --> 1:05:59.289
-To changing that.

1:05:59.789 --> 1:06:01.800
-Cheers to changing that.

1:06:04.179 --> 1:06:08.099
So, you're an architect, right?
-Mhm.

1:06:08.980 --> 1:06:12.500
-Nobody built like you, you designed yourself.

1:06:13.179 --> 1:06:14.679
-Okay,

1:06:14.780 --> 1:06:16.610
I see somebody has a healthy taste in music.

1:06:17.030 --> 1:06:18.599
-Of course.

1:06:19.679 --> 1:06:22.440
Where you from?
-Originally, Pittsburgh.

1:06:22.530 --> 1:06:27.210
-Get the fuck out of here, I'm from Philly.
-Oh, wow, PA.

1:06:27.579 --> 1:06:28.980
That's what's up.

1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:32.630
-Real recognize real. And you--
--looking looking familiar.

1:06:32.639 --> 1:06:36.210
-Okay.
-Can I ask you a question, Michael?

1:06:36.579 --> 1:06:38.500
-Sure. What would you like to know?

1:06:39.679 --> 1:06:42.599
I don't know, like, why didn't you try anything last night?

1:06:44.579 --> 1:06:45.880
-Uh huh.

1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:50.349
-I mean, a drunk girl spends the night at your house,

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:54.500
and most men, well most straight men--
-Okay, let me stop you right there.

1:06:55.079 --> 1:06:57.000
I'm not a homosexual, if that's what you're getting at.

1:06:57.679 --> 1:07:03.253
-I didn't think so, I just had to ask.
-I get it. You're right.

1:07:03.253 --> 1:07:06.210
Most men probably would have taken advantage
of the situation,

1:07:07.079 --> 1:07:08.579
but I'm not most men.

1:07:09.679 --> 1:07:11.179
You see, Celess,

1:07:11.380 --> 1:07:15.099
the only thing I want to take from you
is all of your problems

1:07:15.679 --> 1:07:17.179
and make them go away.

1:07:17.980 --> 1:07:20.672
Gang and we bossy we boujie we flossy

1:07:20.672 --> 1:07:22.639
we mobbin' we dangerous.

1:07:22.639 --> 1:07:24.139
They're moving. We cross it.

1:07:24.139 --> 1:07:27.409
But baby, stay riding my flow my designer

1:07:27.579 --> 1:07:29.773
dripping in that sauce

1:07:29.773 --> 1:07:31.630
Don't get mad at me, I don't love em, I fuck em

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:34.161
I don't chase em, I duck em I replace em with another one had to see,

1:07:34.161 --> 1:07:35.380
he kept calling me Nick.

1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:37.119
But my name is A. B. He was all on my dick,

1:07:37.130 --> 1:07:38.969
ain't no rap, taking all of ya shit

1:07:39.150 --> 1:07:52.469
run up on you wit the gun on my hip throwin shots ain't callin' no hits

1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:54.159
You can't floss with a bitch like this.

1:07:54.170 --> 1:07:55.994
No, you ain't boss for a bitch like this

1:07:55.994 --> 1:07:57.818
I work hard to be a bitch like this

1:07:57.818 --> 1:07:59.440
Ever since I got back on my shit.

1:07:59.449 --> 1:08:01.150
I told Preme I ain't never gonna quit.

1:08:01.159 --> 1:08:02.800
I drop hits never gonna miss.

1:08:02.809 --> 1:08:04.690
And I'm fly So I ain't never going trip

1:08:04.699 --> 1:08:06.900
in the mix like press-on chips on the wave,

1:08:06.900 --> 1:08:07.889
But I ain't pushing no ships.

1:08:31.170 --> 1:08:35.258
Give me a call as you get home, okay?

1:08:35.258 --> 1:08:37.169
Okay, will do.

1:09:27.770 --> 1:09:29.270
-Ah.

1:09:30.869 --> 1:09:34.289
-Baby, I'm from the hood. It's gonna take a lot more
than that to get me to run.

1:09:35.470 --> 1:09:36.970
-So, what you got there?

1:09:38.069 --> 1:09:41.180
I don't know. I just figured since your son
wanted to be Batman,

1:09:41.189 --> 1:09:43.600
I could be Harley Quinn, and you could be my Joker.

1:09:44.670 --> 1:09:47.837
-Uh huh. Let's do it.
-Really?

1:09:47.837 --> 1:09:49.337
-Yeah.

1:09:51.369 --> 1:09:55.100
-Do you want to know how to scare me?
-Huh?

1:09:56.170 --> 1:09:57.689
-Do you want to know how to scare me?

1:09:58.770 --> 1:10:01.289
Tell me you can't pay for these costumes.
-

1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:10.960
-Thanks, babe.

1:10:13.260 --> 1:10:16.189
When one door closes, another one opens,

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:18.579
and Michael definitely had me open.

1:10:21.060 --> 1:10:27.189
#  Got the feeling happen when my lover's near

1:10:27.859 --> 1:10:34.609
#  Lord let this moment last for another year

1:10:34.609 --> 1:10:37.647
#  Though today has ended

1:10:37.647 --> 1:10:41.229
#  The night's still young I'd say

1:10:41.239 --> 1:10:47.880
#  Lover, don't go away

1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:55.622
#  Let it be the thing that I am longing for

1:10:55.622 --> 1:10:58.599
#  Let's fly out from Manhattan

1:10:58.599 --> 1:11:02.479
#  To the California shore

1:11:02.859 --> 1:11:07.300
#  Just to watch the ships at night

1:11:07.300 --> 1:11:09.890
#  On the San Francisco Bay

1:11:09.890 --> 1:11:15.479
#  Oh, lover, please, please stay.

1:11:16.060 --> 1:11:19.880
#  Don't say you have to go

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:20.260
#  Don't say...

1:11:20.260 --> 1:11:23.079
Michael was making good on his word.

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:27.189
He really was taking my problems
and making them go away.

1:11:27.199 --> 1:11:29.720
-Okay, but is he taking some of the bills away?

1:11:29.729 --> 1:11:32.689
Did he offer to pay your rent, car insurance, anything?

1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:35.479
Or are you just giving up the coochie for costumes?

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.460
You're cute, though. Let me see.

1:11:39.060 --> 1:11:41.199
And that vitamin bag is cute, too.

1:11:41.210 --> 1:11:44.880
I ain't know they came in different colors.
That must be that LA shit

1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:49.189
But to be honest,
I'm not even on that type of time with him right now.

1:11:49.199 --> 1:11:51.789
Like I'm honestly just enjoying the way he treats me.

1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:55.529
-Well, unless he's treating you to Chanel and Gucci, I'm lost.

1:11:55.539 --> 1:11:57.770
I mean, love is cute, don't get me wrong.

1:11:57.779 --> 1:12:00.289
But you got a little more than love to give.

1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:02.579
According to Terry, you got a lot more.

1:12:03.449 --> 1:12:05.649
Listen, you know better to be falling for a ***.

1:12:05.649 --> 1:12:08.979
And for one, you can not put all your eggs in one skillet.

1:12:09.649 --> 1:12:12.920
-It's basket, Sis.
-Whatever, Bitch.

1:12:12.930 --> 1:12:15.180
And for two, the longer you take,

1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:17.189
the harder it's gonna be when it's time to cut it off.

1:12:17.199 --> 1:12:18.699
I'm just trying to protect you.

1:12:19.250 --> 1:12:23.005
-I know you are.
And that's why I know you're gonna say yes

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:26.479
when I tell you what I called you for in the first place.

1:12:27.550 --> 1:12:29.390
-Oh, God. What?

1:12:35.050 --> 1:12:37.684
-Hey, Michael.
-Hey, Lisa. How are you?

1:12:37.684 --> 1:12:40.970
-I'm great.
-Our guests should already be here.

1:12:40.979 --> 1:12:42.800
-Yes, and they've been in good hands.

1:12:43.090 --> 1:12:44.590
Right this way.

1:12:50.149 --> 1:12:51.649
This was my moment of truth.

1:12:53.050 --> 1:12:55.479
Michael thought Tina and Derek flew out to meet him,

1:12:56.149 --> 1:12:59.880
but in actuality, I asked them to come for moral support.

1:13:01.449 --> 1:13:03.579
-Your waitress will be right by to grab your drink order.

1:13:03.579 --> 1:13:06.170
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

1:13:06.550 --> 1:13:08.050
How are you enjoying it?

1:13:09.449 --> 1:13:13.880
I know, the food is amazing.

1:13:14.649 --> 1:13:18.479
So, Michael, Tina told me that you're responsible
for building this place.

1:13:18.850 --> 1:13:21.079
-Yeah, I designed it and my team put it up.

1:13:22.550 --> 1:13:27.380
-Actually, Michael's one of the top architects in the city.
-Excellent.

1:13:33.550 --> 1:13:37.649
-And on that note, since we're all here,

1:13:37.659 --> 1:13:41.069
I might as well tell you guys
why I brought you guys out tonight.

1:13:43.149 --> 1:13:44.649
Michael,

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:49.000
I have something to tell you.

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.020
Michael,

1:14:02.739 --> 1:14:04.869
I'm a man.

1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:07.840
-A man?

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.340
-nager.

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:11.340
I'm a manager.

1:14:13.439 --> 1:14:14.939
-A manager?

1:14:15.039 --> 1:14:16.670
-Yeah, I'm a manager.

1:14:18.140 --> 1:14:20.270
I know in the beginning of our relationship,

1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:24.060
I told you that I was the owner of a beauty salon.

1:14:26.539 --> 1:14:30.060
But actually, I'm just a manager at one.

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:36.060
-Oh, shit, Celess. Don't scare me like that.

1:14:37.239 --> 1:14:38.869
I thought you said you were a man.

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:45.960
-Almost gave me a heart attack. That was crazy.

1:14:46.340 --> 1:14:51.560
-Waitress. One more round, please.

1:14:52.239 --> 1:14:54.890
-Bitch. I needed this.
-You and me both.

1:14:54.890 --> 1:14:58.880
Shit, I was more stressed out than you.
-You?

1:14:58.890 --> 1:15:01.069
Girl, that felt like the longest ride ever.

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:03.923
You know, he said that he would actually design
my damn beauty salon

1:15:03.923 --> 1:15:05.560
and have his firm build it.

1:15:05.939 --> 1:15:10.118
-Now you know, the old me would be like,
Sis, get your coins.

1:15:10.130 --> 1:15:11.109
Collect your booth rent.

1:15:11.109 --> 1:15:13.460
Money don't give a damn what you got under your skirt.

1:15:14.340 --> 1:15:16.920
But the new me, I don't know

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:19.670
sis I feel like you should stop leading ol' boy on.

1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:22.090
-The new you?

1:15:22.090 --> 1:15:24.739
Who is the new you, and where the hell did she come from?

1:15:24.750 --> 1:15:29.270
Because just last week, your ass was on,
fuck these *** get money shit.

1:15:29.739 --> 1:15:33.609
-I don't know. It's like something clicked
once I met Michael, you know

1:15:33.609 --> 1:15:36.270
And I definitely see what you mean about how he treats you.

1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:38.640
He really respects women.

1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:42.869
He must got a bomb ass relationship with his mom.

1:15:43.439 --> 1:15:45.369
-Your mom?
-Yeah.

1:15:46.229 --> 1:15:48.560
I got to meet the most important person in your life,

1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:53.060
so it is now time for you to meet
the most important person in mine.

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:56.694
Well, tied with my son, but you already met him,

1:15:56.694 --> 1:15:58.770
and he gave you his nod of approval.

1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:01.560
I think it was those costumes that won him over.

1:16:03.630 --> 1:16:05.649
-Michael, do you think we're moving too fast?

1:16:08.829 --> 1:16:11.060
-I didn't. Why do you?

1:16:12.329 --> 1:16:16.750
-I don't know. It seems like it. I mean, I like you a lot

1:16:17.329 --> 1:16:19.649
and I have fun with you, and it's different.

1:16:20.529 --> 1:16:23.850
Different than any relationship I've ever been in,
in a good way.

1:16:24.430 --> 1:16:28.060
But I just don't want us moving so fast
that we regret it in the long run.

1:16:28.529 --> 1:16:31.460
-Well, it's hard to regret it when you lead with your heart,

1:16:32.130 --> 1:16:35.250
and ever since I saw you in my parking lot,
that's all I've been doing.

1:16:36.229 --> 1:16:39.960
-Yeah, but sometimes our hearts are-- our hearts are weak.

1:16:40.630 --> 1:16:44.460
We need our minds to make sure
that we're not falling too hard or too fast,

1:16:44.460 --> 1:16:45.930
if that makes sense.

1:16:45.930 --> 1:16:48.460
-No, that doesn't make sense.

1:16:49.029 --> 1:16:51.350
Just like this conversation doesn't make sense.

1:16:52.130 --> 1:16:53.630
Where you going with this?

1:16:59.430 --> 1:17:01.350
-I don't know why I let it get this far

1:17:03.229 --> 1:17:04.960
and I feel so bad that I did.

1:17:07.130 --> 1:17:09.100
But I'm just not right for you, Michael.

1:17:09.100 --> 1:17:11.850
-Well, why don't you let me decide that?

1:17:23.529 --> 1:17:25.960
-You probably come from a two parent household

1:17:26.329 --> 1:17:29.149
where everybody speaks proper English and has a career.

1:17:35.930 --> 1:17:39.649
-Are you worried about being judged by my family?
Is that what this is about?

1:17:40.529 --> 1:17:44.149
Look, Celess, I love the fact that we're so different.

1:17:44.729 --> 1:17:46.500
That means we'll never get bored with one another,

1:17:46.859 --> 1:17:51.149
we'll always be learning new things about each other.
That excites me.

1:17:54.329 --> 1:17:56.250
But that's what scares the hell out of me

1:17:56.729 --> 1:17:58.720
for reasons that you'll never understand.

1:17:59.039 --> 1:18:00.539
-Okay.

1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:04.850
Mm. You wanna lay all our cards out, right here, right now?

1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:07.420
Would that make you feel better?

1:18:08.319 --> 1:18:10.649
Because whatever it takes, I'm willing to do.

1:18:12.819 --> 1:18:14.319
You mean that much to me.

1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:21.153
-Michael, you're one of the good ones, okay.

1:18:21.153 --> 1:18:23.939
And you don't deserve what I bring to the table.

1:18:24.819 --> 1:18:27.835
-Oh, so it's more so about the fact

1:18:27.835 --> 1:18:30.850
that you're not where you wanna be career wise?

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:34.939
Listen, I don't intend for you to take care of me.

1:18:36.020 --> 1:18:39.649
I do a great job of that on my own, have been for years.

1:18:40.319 --> 1:18:42.649
If anything, I would prefer for you not to work.

1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.789
I would like for my woman to be home for me
when I get there,

1:18:47.819 --> 1:18:50.350
to have hugs and kisses waiting for me,

1:18:51.819 --> 1:18:55.250
to be there for our kids when they get off the school bus.

1:18:56.819 --> 1:18:58.319
-I'm not her, Michael.

1:18:59.119 --> 1:19:00.619
I'm not that woman.

1:19:01.119 --> 1:19:03.250
I'm not that girl that you take home to Mom.

1:19:09.420 --> 1:19:13.733
I would love to be, sure, but I'm not.

1:19:13.733 --> 1:19:15.890
And it's not by choice.

1:19:15.930 --> 1:19:17.439
It's just what it is.

1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:21.850
Now, please don't make this any harder than it already is,

1:19:22.619 --> 1:19:25.439
and just respect the fact
that I think that we need some space.

1:19:26.319 --> 1:19:28.960
-I've done nothing but treat you with honor and respect.

1:19:28.970 --> 1:19:31.850
And I want to show you more,
but you won't let me because what?

1:19:32.220 --> 1:19:33.939
We come from two different walks of life?

1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:36.319
Mhm.

1:19:36.319 --> 1:19:38.649
Well, in the words of somebody that I love,

1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:41.539
it's gonna take more than that to make me run.

1:19:49.619 --> 1:19:50.659
-I'm just gonna say it.

1:19:50.659 --> 1:19:52.159
Shit.

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:56.420
Michael, I'm a man.

1:19:57.520 --> 1:19:59.439
Not a manager. A man.

1:20:04.643 --> 1:20:07.761
That's what I was trying to tell you at the restaurant.

1:20:08.970 --> 1:20:11.939
That's why Derek and Tina flew in for moral support.

1:20:15.510 --> 1:20:18.439
I just couldn't go through with it after your reaction.

1:20:24.310 --> 1:20:26.539
But the truth is, I was born a boy,

1:20:27.909 --> 1:20:30.039
and I do have male body parts.

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.039
I was trying to break up with you
before it even got to this point.

1:20:43.510 --> 1:20:48.789
And it hurts to have to tell you this, but you don't deserve this shit.

1:20:48.819 --> 1:20:51.829
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:21:01.810 --> 1:21:06.630
-So, I made love to a man.

1:21:10.409 --> 1:21:11.909
I kissed a man.

1:21:18.710 --> 1:21:22.829
How did-- how did we make love if you--

1:21:25.310 --> 1:21:27.520
Why did you let me take you out in the first place?

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:31.439
You could have just said you weren't interested.
I don't understand,

1:21:33.810 --> 1:21:35.310
-Michael. I'm sorry.

1:21:35.609 --> 1:21:37.539
I'm just so sorry.

1:21:39.109 --> 1:21:42.119
But I want you to know that who I was

1:21:42.130 --> 1:21:45.130
when we were in this relationship is who I really am.

1:21:46.609 --> 1:21:49.329
I was just born in a body that I don't belong in.

1:21:50.810 --> 1:21:53.586
But who you fell in love with is still here.

1:21:56.810 --> 1:21:59.829
-And then you let me introduce you to my son.

1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:03.329
I introduced you to my son.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.229
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:11.800
I really am.

1:22:14.699 --> 1:22:16.329
Michael.

1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:19.729
Michael, please don't leave.

1:22:58.899 --> 1:23:01.619
-Surprise.
-Makeup.

1:23:03.100 --> 1:23:05.630
-What's going on?
-What the hell are you doing here, girl?

1:23:05.630 --> 1:23:07.173
First of all, you thought I was gonna

1:23:07.173 --> 1:23:09.489
let you bring in New Year's and your birthday by yourself?

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:10.890
You're definitely bugging, okay?

1:23:10.890 --> 1:23:14.012
-How did you even get up?
-Your doorman be asleep

1:23:14.012 --> 1:23:17.930
Okay, as soon as he went to the back
to get a package, I just slid on past.

1:23:17.939 --> 1:23:19.520
Speaking of packages,

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.500
open your birthday gift.

1:23:21.899 --> 1:23:23.340
-I'm not even hungry, Sis.

1:23:23.340 --> 1:23:27.420
-But you sure is thirsty. Open this box, Bitch.

1:23:33.289 --> 1:23:36.329
-Only you would get some shit like this.
-Look underneath.

1:23:40.100 --> 1:23:43.119
-Tina. What is this?
-Happy birthday neighbor.

1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:53.100
-Tina.

1:23:54.899 --> 1:23:57.850
Sis, I can't accept a whole house
from you as a birthday gift.

1:23:57.850 --> 1:23:59.729
What the hell am I supposed to get you on your birthday?

1:23:59.739 --> 1:24:03.210
-Please. I would have been stopped counting
birthdays a long time ago

1:24:03.210 --> 1:24:04.710
if it wasn't for you.

1:24:04.890 --> 1:24:09.119
You being the level headed one
has saved my ass a bunch of times.

1:24:09.590 --> 1:24:11.310
Let's just say I owe you this house.

1:24:14.789 --> 1:24:16.520
-So you want me to move to LA with you?

1:24:17.989 --> 1:24:22.920
It's not even about what I want. Shit has hit the fan, sis.

1:24:25.489 --> 1:24:28.210
I think we definitely overstayed our welcome here.

1:24:29.289 --> 1:24:31.020
But don't worry. I got it all mapped out.

1:24:31.489 --> 1:24:35.619
I got us two one- way tickets to LA,
leaving at 10 a. m. tomorrow morning.

1:24:36.489 --> 1:24:38.029
-What?
-Yes.

1:24:38.039 --> 1:24:40.020
I say we go and never look back.

1:24:42.289 --> 1:24:46.750
But first, we gotta turn up one last New Year's Eve
in the A, Bitch

1:24:46.750 --> 1:24:48.250
We gotta fuck it up.

1:24:49.245 --> 1:24:51.920
You coming or naw? You coming or naw?

1:24:52.289 --> 1:24:53.460
-I love you so much.

1:24:53.460 --> 1:24:54.960
-I love you, baby.

1:24:55.689 --> 1:24:57.920
I guess it was time to say goodbye to Atlanta.

1:24:59.189 --> 1:25:02.020
And Tina's birthday gift was the perfect exit strategy.

1:25:07.890 --> 1:25:11.710
-Ready for a little pregame girl? Here we go.

1:25:12.090 --> 1:25:13.590
-Single or double shot?

1:25:13.789 --> 1:25:15.979
-I want a single, but I know you're gonna give me a double.

1:25:15.989 --> 1:25:19.310
-Triple shot, it is.
-Oh, Lord.

1:25:20.189 --> 1:25:23.627
-Girl, tonight is gonna be so fucking lit.

1:25:23.627 --> 1:25:26.000
-Yeah, let's try to make it to the club tonight.

1:25:26.010 --> 1:25:27.810
-We are.
-A little bit.

1:25:28.390 --> 1:25:32.920
-There you go, scary.
-That's a lot.

1:25:34.489 --> 1:25:35.989
Ooh.

1:25:36.689 --> 1:25:39.489
All right, cheers to new beginnings.

1:25:39.500 --> 1:25:41.839
Happy New Year, Bitch.

1:25:49.289 --> 1:25:50.369
-You can drink the rest.

1:25:50.369 --> 1:25:51.869
I don't know how you do that shit.

1:25:58.489 --> 1:26:02.100
-Bitch--
-What?

1:26:02.779 --> 1:26:04.500
You're not happy to see me?

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:07.180
I asked you a question.

1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:09.020
-Khalil, what the fuck are you doing?

1:26:09.020 --> 1:26:10.520
You're trying to go back to jail?

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:13.399
-It's funny you mentioned that

1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:17.399
because I just got out from doing six months,
and I didn't hear from you once.

1:26:17.609 --> 1:26:18.729
That's fucked up.

1:26:18.729 --> 1:26:22.210
-I told you from the rip,
I ain't gonna be nobody's fucking penpal.

1:26:22.979 --> 1:26:24.560
-Who do you think I am?

1:26:24.609 --> 1:26:27.310
One of these clown ass *** that you're used to fucking over?

1:26:27.779 --> 1:26:29.899
-Khalil, please. She didn't mean that shit.

1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:32.500
-Look, we got a ride waiting downstairs for us.

1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:34.310
If we don't go down now, they're gonna come up.

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:38.000
-Oh, y'all think I'm stupid, huh?

1:26:39.079 --> 1:26:41.119
Yeah, that's it. Y'all think I'm fucking stupid.

1:26:41.130 --> 1:26:44.738
-Khalil, Celess, don't have shit to do with this.
This between me and you.

1:26:44.738 --> 1:26:46.600
Get the fucking gun out of her face.

1:26:46.757 --> 1:26:48.710
-You don't call no fucking shots.

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:53.310
Matter of fact, who said this bitch ain't got shit to do with it?

1:26:54.279 --> 1:26:56.600
Oh, y'all thought James wasn't gonna tell me, huh?

1:26:57.479 --> 1:27:00.614
-Well, let James deal with her and you deal with me, please.

1:27:00.614 --> 1:27:02.399
-And him fuck up his career?

1:27:03.579 --> 1:27:04.880
Nah.

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:06.500
See, I already got a felony.

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:09.496
So this shit ain't gonna change my life none.

1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:11.496
- Tina, no!

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.600
-No!

1:27:24.399 --> 1:27:26.210
Look what you did!

1:27:42.979 --> 1:27:45.600
2020 came in with the devil on her back,

1:27:46.380 --> 1:27:49.970
feeding the world heartache off her pitchfork.

1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:52.210
League MVP, Kobe Bryant died earlier this afternoon...

1:27:52.210 --> 1:27:54.352
This organization declared

1:27:54.352 --> 1:27:57.210
that the coronavirus crisis is now a pandemic

1:28:00.457 --> 1:28:02.982
And visiting my best friend
at her grave

1:28:02.982 --> 1:28:11.500
was like washing it down with gasoline.

1:28:11.970 --> 1:28:12.710
#  Sometimes I find myself...

1:28:12.710 --> 1:28:17.499
That time I didn't wake up in my bed
with the TV on reruns,

1:28:17.499 --> 1:28:19.210
and it wasn't a nightmare.

1:28:19.682 --> 1:28:22.403
It was real life.

1:28:30.670 --> 1:28:32.170
#  No cares,

1:28:32.270 --> 1:28:33.899
#  No cares

1:28:34.270 --> 1:28:39.189
#  Falling

1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:46.321
#  Hear me cry
It's over now

1:28:48.770 --> 1:28:51.869
#  I'm drowning here

1:28:51.869 --> 1:28:53.369
#  in the depths of all this sin

1:28:55.845 --> 1:28:58.557
#  I'm hurting here

1:28:58.770 --> 1:29:01.930
#  Somebody catch my tears

1:29:01.930 --> 1:29:03.430
#  I'm drowning here

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.500
I got lucky.

1:29:07.670 --> 1:29:10.399
The doctor told me my hand slowed the speed of the bullet,

1:29:11.069 --> 1:29:13.500
 so it only grazed my cheek.

1:29:13.970 --> 1:29:15.600
I couldn't help but wonder why--

1:29:17.270 --> 1:29:27.899
 why her and not me? 

1:29:31.470 --> 1:29:36.100
-Celess, you were Tina's true soulmate.

1:29:42.270 --> 1:29:43.770
She wanted you to have this.

1:29:58.869 --> 1:30:03.510
 Dear friend. You are a blessing from God,
the only father, I acknowledge.

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:05.750
I remember back in ninth grade when you stood up for me,

1:30:05.750 --> 1:30:08.750
and I thought to myself, either this boy sees right through me

1:30:08.750 --> 1:30:12.488
and knows I'm a guy, or he's trying to play straight and impress me.

1:30:12.488 --> 1:30:14.479
Either way, I knew you were gay.

1:30:14.489 --> 1:30:16.430
And from that day on, I took you under my wing,

1:30:16.430 --> 1:30:18.079
and I taught you everything I knew,

1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:20.789
so well that you became better at the game than me.

1:30:21.158 --> 1:30:23.560
Now, I've finally retired my jersey.

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:26.970
And if you're reading this,
it means you finally retired yours, too.

1:30:26.979 --> 1:30:29.189
 We had a hell of a run, friend.

1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:33.329
PS. I know you're probably wondering what Derek did to me.

1:30:33.699 --> 1:30:40.789
The answer, he showed me unconditional love.

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.979
And now that's all I want for you.

1:30:45.060 --> 1:30:46.560
Welcome home.

1:31:44.359 --> 1:31:45.859
-Hello?

1:31:48.159 --> 1:31:49.659
Michael?

1:31:50.659 --> 1:31:54.397
You don't know how good it is to hear your voice right now.
