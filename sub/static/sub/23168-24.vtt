00:03.270 --> 00:04.870

00:04.939 --> 00:06.705

00:08.376 --> 00:09.975

- [bleep] my life, bro.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.655

- Yeah, it's like we've traded.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.491

Tell us about yourself.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.613

<i> - So I'm originally</i>

<i> for basically the weather.</i>

03:07.087 --> 03:09.021
<i> Running and motorcycles</i>
<i> are like my things</i>

03:09.089 --> 03:11.323
<i> and, you know, Michigan</i>
<i> has brutal winters</i>

03:11.392 --> 03:12.858
<i> and, like, half the year</i>
<i> you can't ride</i>

03:12.927 --> 03:14.726
<i> so I couldn't do it.</i>

03:14.795 --> 03:18.664

and I'm a runner.

- That's dope.
- So this is like your man.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.834

03:24.838 --> 03:26.238
I don't think we
actually need you.

"Okay, bye!" [laughing]

03:28.242 --> 03:29.508
- Okay, so cool.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.211
So tell us about this girl
and how it all went down.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.846
<i> - So it goes down in the DMs.</i>
<i> I got two emojis.</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:36.481
<i> Like the heart eyes</i>
<i> or something.</i>

<i> I'm like, "Who's this?"</i>
<i> Click, go to the page.</i>

03:38.819 --> 03:40.652
<i> I'm like, "Okay, she's fine."</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:41.787

followers or--

03:41.855 --> 03:43.855
<i> - I have like 280,000.</i>

03:43.924 --> 03:45.123

to getting messages

03:45.192 --> 03:46.625
that you don't know,
obviously.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.060
<i> - All the time.</i>
<i> All the time.</i>

03:48.128 --> 03:49.561

about her Instagram page?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.029
Does she have a lot
of followers?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.030
<i> - Yeah, she has, like,</i>
<i> almost 100K.</i>

03:52.099 --> 03:53.565

- Okay.

<i> I'm in LA, back.</i>

03:58.606 --> 04:00.606
<i> Switch numbers and then</i>
<i> next thing you know,</i>

04:00.674 --> 04:02.174
<i> she's, like, texting me.</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:04.042
<i> She's not just the fine,</i>
<i> you know, pretty face.</i>

04:04.111 --> 04:05.444
<i> She's actually down to earth</i>

04:05.512 --> 04:07.212
<i> and has a dope-ass</i>
<i> personality.</i>

04:07.281 --> 04:09.248
<i> I try to hang out right away.</i>

04:09.316 --> 04:10.983
<i> I'm like, "You're in LA, like,</i>
<i> hey, are you free tonight?"</i>

04:11.051 --> 04:12.684
- Yeah.
<i> - And, you know, it's like,</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:14.419
<i> "Oh, I'm busy." I'm like,</i>
<i> "All right, that's fine."</i>

04:14.488 --> 04:16.221
- Have you spoken on the phone?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.823
<i> - No, I've never</i>
<i> heard her voice.</i>

04:17.891 --> 04:20.325
<i> Dude, every time I've tried</i>

04:20.394 --> 04:22.594
<i> to FaceTime she won't respond</i>
<i> for, like, 24 hours.</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:24.363
<i> And then she'll be like,</i>
<i> "Oh, sorry, I was busy."</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:26.198
<i> - Then I'll ask again</i>
<i> and she'll be like,</i>

04:26.267 --> 04:27.432
<i> "Oh, my front camera</i>
<i> is broken."</i>

04:27.501 --> 04:28.767
- Wait a second, hold on.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.202
This is a girl
who has an Instagram

04:30.271 --> 04:32.204
where she probably
posts a lot of selfies.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.974
<i> - This--exactly! So all her</i>
<i> story is her, like--</i>

04:36.043 --> 04:38.076
- Right. She's always
posting to her story. Right.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.511
<i> - I'm like, "Okay."</i>
- Yeah.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.013
- And she sent you videos

04:41.081 --> 04:43.015
and pictures that are of her?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.350
<i> - Yeah, and they weren't</i>
<i> on The Gram, so I'm like,</i>

04:45.419 --> 04:47.452
<i> "All right, this is obviously</i>
<i> a personal one."</i>

04:47.521 --> 04:50.322
<i> So I'm like--she's, like,</i>
<i> keeping me in this loop.</i>

04:50.391 --> 04:53.325
- In the video she texted you,
did she ever, like,

04:53.394 --> 04:55.627
say anything to you?
- Nope.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.129
- Like, not your name?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.998
<i> - She'd just post</i>
<i> some sexy [bleep].</i>

05:00.067 --> 05:02.234
- Have you sent her
any sexy stuff?

05:02.303 --> 05:04.236
<i> - I ain't send nothing</i>
<i> because I was like,</i>

05:04.305 --> 05:06.338
<i> "She could be playing</i>
<i> some weird joke on me."</i>

05:06.407 --> 05:09.908
<i> One time she was like, "Would</i>
<i> you be down for a threesome?"</i>

05:09.977 --> 05:11.643
- Unprompted?
- Specifically a threesome

05:11.712 --> 05:13.712
or specifically a threesome
with your roommate?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.847
<i> - She hit me up and was like,</i>
<i> "Are you down for threesome?"</i>

05:15.916 --> 05:17.616
<i> - I said, "Depends with who."</i>

05:17.685 --> 05:19.685
<i> - She said, "What about</i>
<i> that roommate of yours.</i>

05:19.753 --> 05:21.186
<i> The Asian one."</i>

05:21.255 --> 05:22.988
<i> And I was like,</i>
<i> "Oh, yeah, that's my boy."</i>

05:23.057 --> 05:26.191
- Wow.
<i> - So, she goes out, DMs him.</i>

05:26.260 --> 05:28.493
- So she was
very open about it?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.128
<i> - Open. So, I'm like, "Are</i>
<i> you going to hit him up--"</i>

05:30.197 --> 05:31.897
<i> I've been trying</i>
<i> to see her every day.</i>

05:31.965 --> 05:34.132
- We were thinking maybe
it's your roommate Kevin

05:34.201 --> 05:35.901
and he's just trying to see
if you'd be interested in him.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.703
<i> - [laughing]</i>

05:37.771 --> 05:41.940
<i> I'm sorry. No, there's</i>
<i> no way it could be Kevin.</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:44.576
- All right. Well, cool.
Look, so where are you?

05:44.645 --> 05:47.312
<i> - South Central-ish</i>
<i> Los Angeles.</i>

05:47.381 --> 05:50.148
- So we could just cruise
down to you right now.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.917
<i> - I'm ready when you are.</i>
- Great.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.485
- Let's do it.
- Bye.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.420
<i> - Buh-bye.</i>

05:55.489 --> 05:58.090
- If you've been talking
to someone for a long enough

05:58.158 --> 06:00.425
period of time and you haven't
heard their voice,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.728
it's usually because they
are the opposite gender

06:02.796 --> 06:03.995
than you think they are.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.597
- It's weird.
Something's weird.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.301
But whatever it is, it feels
like if it's not Safari,

06:09.370 --> 06:11.470
he's not going to be,
like, devastated.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.873
- But, if Safari isn't real, we
should figure out who this is.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.641
He definitely, I think,
deserves some answers.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.277
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

06:19.346 --> 06:23.048
All right.
Dallas is alarmingly handsome.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.416
- That's why it's so funny.

06:24.485 --> 06:28.253
He's great, so whoever
he's communicating with,

06:28.322 --> 06:30.789
like, why not meet him?
- Right.

06:30.858 --> 06:35.660
It's very strange for someone
to have his attention

06:35.729 --> 06:37.195
and not want
to meet up with him,

06:37.264 --> 06:38.930
unless they're hiding
something.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.900
- That's what I'm saying.
- Here we are.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.239
- What up?
- Hey!

06:47.307 --> 06:48.607
- Hey, man.
- How you doing?

06:48.675 --> 06:50.308
- Good to meet you.
- Hi.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.978
- This is Tallulah.
- Hi! Nice to meet you!

06:53.046 --> 06:55.113
- Come in.
- Whoa.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.682
- Those are actually Kevin.
He's a body builder.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.117
- Wow, really?

06:59.186 --> 07:02.854
No wonder Safari
is trying to make that happen.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.589
- Exactly.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.292
- Okay, great.
Cake book?

07:07.361 --> 07:09.428
- Yeah, don't open--
- What is this?

07:09.496 --> 07:10.996
- I'm naked in there!

07:11.064 --> 07:12.464
- Wait, you made a cook book?

07:12.533 --> 07:15.133
Maybe I should bake a cake
butt naked.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.502
This is, like, soft core.
- Ohhh.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.471
- It gets explicitly,
like, fun and playful.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.740
- Did you sell this book?
- Yeah, we sold out.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.942
- Oh, my goodness.
- Wow.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.611
- I wanna do a book.
- You can!

07:27.681 --> 07:30.549
- So first of all--it's funny,
you're a little different

07:30.617 --> 07:32.451
than people we usually
have on the show.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.688
You talking to Safari
is for fun.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.257
Don't get me wrong,
I'm sure she seems cool,

07:39.326 --> 07:42.461
and she's beautiful, but, like,
you're not in love with her.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.530
- Man, that's the thing, right?
At any point I could walk away.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.499
- Right.
- But I can't!

07:48.535 --> 07:50.502
- Is it uncomfortable not
being in the power position?

07:50.571 --> 07:53.171
- Man, I don't know. She still
makes me happy, I mean...

07:53.240 --> 07:56.308
If there any chance it is her,
I want to follow this through.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.710
Because I know if we do meet
that physical chemistry

07:58.779 --> 08:00.111
is going to be great.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.847
It's like, all right, bam,
let's do this.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.782
- Well, I'm very curious to see
what this girl looks like.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.050
- Yeah.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.251
- Will you bring up
her page for me?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.887
All right, let's see.
Safari.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.523
70,000 followers.
Exotic dancer.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.192
- She's beautiful.
- She's definitely beautiful.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.861
- Rockin' bod.
- Very sexy.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.263
Here she is holding a water
bottle in her buttocks.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.731
- Man. When she posted that
I was like,

08:19.800 --> 08:20.966
"All right, that's a lot."

08:21.034 --> 08:23.735
- That's impressive.
- [laughing]

08:23.804 --> 08:26.438
- Yeah, all right, I get it.
Uh, I get it.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.206
Do you still have
all your texts with her?

08:28.275 --> 08:30.475
- Yeah.
- There we go. September 1st.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.310
Just about
almost two months now.

08:32.379 --> 08:36.147
- Wow. She said, "What's up
sexy? So, are you single?"

08:36.216 --> 08:37.516
Wow, like, right off the bat.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.583
- [laughing]

08:38.652 --> 08:40.252
- I've low key
been stalking you.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.654
I love your hair and eyes
and those muscles.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.222
So you guys, yeah,
right away, kind of starting

08:44.291 --> 08:45.924
to get to know each other.
- Exactly.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.727
- Oh, and then--this is your
first time--want to FaceTime?

08:48.795 --> 08:50.128
She said,
"Sorry, babe.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.763
My phone front
screen camera is cracked."

08:51.832 --> 08:54.332
- See what I mean? I'm like--
- "Gotta get it fixed."

08:54.401 --> 08:57.135
- The front camera thing is
such bull[bleep].

08:57.204 --> 08:59.004
- It is bull[bleep].
- For someone who is

08:59.072 --> 09:02.674
an Instagram presence
like that. I mean--

09:02.743 --> 09:05.377
- If your--if that camera broke
you'd be at the Apple store,

09:05.445 --> 09:08.146
in a minute, yeah.
- Instantly. That's your job.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.548
- All right, so then
she sends you this video.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.183
- Five days later.
- From the strip club.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.252
Wait a second--this was--
this was kind of interesting.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.323
So you, in response to her
twerking video said,

09:18.392 --> 09:20.058
"OMG I need that ASAP."
- Yeah.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.995
- And she said, "Oh, yeah?
Be careful what you wish for."

09:24.064 --> 09:27.098
- That's scary dude.
- Yo, I'm home.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.567
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.570
- How you guys doing?
How you doing, buddy?

09:31.638 --> 09:33.138
- What's up, man?
- How you doing? Kevin.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.472
- I'm Nev.
- Nev, nice to meet ya.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.408
- Hi! I'm Tallulah.
- Kevin!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.109
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.377
- We were just having
a little chat.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.746
What do you make of this
whole situation?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.015
- I'm--I'm curious
to what's going on.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.751
She's caught my attention.
She DM'd me and she was like,

09:46.820 --> 09:48.386
"Your friend Dallas is fine,"
like,

09:48.455 --> 09:49.921
"You're fine as hell, too.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.222
<i> We should all hang out</i>
<i> together sometime.</i>

09:51.291 --> 09:52.958
<i> Are you down for some fun?</i>

09:53.026 --> 09:55.260
This isn't the first time we've
had these offers, you know,

09:55.329 --> 09:57.362
but we haven't had
that--that--that moment yet,

09:57.431 --> 10:00.532
so it's like, a little,
bro bucket list that we got

10:00.601 --> 10:03.301
that we...
- Wow, all right.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.769
All right, so look.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.706
We got to figure out if
someone's using her page

10:07.774 --> 10:12.377
to sort of divert guys
or if it's just a fake account.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.046
It could be a guy.
Have you considered that?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.415
- I have because--

10:17.484 --> 10:20.652
I have, like, 55% guys.
- Oh, really?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.987
- Yeah.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.189
- So send us
whatever info you have.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.224
We'll get into it
and hopefully tomorrow

10:26.293 --> 10:28.994
we'll have some answers.
- Thank you, bro.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.462
- Yeah, man.
- I appreciate it.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.131
- I need updates ASAP.
- Great to meet you, man.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.133
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.101
- Have a great day.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.069
- Oh, boy.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.704
- You know, it's funny.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.108
We don't spend a lot of time
thinking about beautiful men

10:43.176 --> 10:44.876
and what that
experience is like.

10:44.945 --> 10:49.381
- When you don't experience
a lot of rejection,

10:49.449 --> 10:55.153
I think that it creates a,
uh, need to get to the bottom

10:55.222 --> 10:58.456
of why someone isn't
as there for you.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.926
- I don't think Dallas is ready
for not getting the girl.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.429
- Yeah.
- And being rejected.

11:07.901 --> 11:13.405
- I play a fun game with Cleo.
I'll put the duck under a cup.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.674
- I'll--you know,
I'll, like, mix them up.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.009
You know, I'll say to her,
where's the duck?

11:18.078 --> 11:20.912
And then she'll lift the cup up
and it's not there.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.149
- I believed it. [laughing]
A magician.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.284
- Anyway, let's see
if we can figure this out.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.621
We've got Dallas
talking to Safari.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.290
Page seems legit,
but she lives in LA,

11:32.359 --> 11:33.458
she's too busy to see him--

11:33.527 --> 11:35.727
- Kept dodging, yeah.
- Right.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.263
- He's more and more intrigued
the longer she makes him wait.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.764
- Yeah.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.266
- So it sort of becomes
something of a mission for him.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.667
But if it's not her,

11:42.736 --> 11:44.436
which I think there's
a good chance it isn't,

11:44.504 --> 11:47.772
then someone has access to her
page or the whole page is fake.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.307
- Yeah, there's something
that's not kosher.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.675
We have to figure it out.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.143
- All right,
let's see what we can find.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.412
All right, here's Safari's
number. Okay, great.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.980
And here is her Instagram.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.017
- There's not a lot
that we're really given here.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.052
- Yeah. All right,
well let's, I guess,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.888
start with a phone number.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.157
All right,
reverse phone search.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.393
Okay, so the number
comes up registered

12:08.462 --> 12:12.197
to William [bleep], age 53.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.299
- LA.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.867
- Mm. Interesting.

12:15.936 --> 12:21.106
Let's see if Safari follows
anyone named William.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.174
- On Instagram.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.746
- Nothing with
the last name [bleep].

12:29.116 --> 12:31.549
All right,
so what else can we look for?

12:31.618 --> 12:32.951
So let's go back
to her page--

12:33.019 --> 12:34.452
- Wait.
- Wait, did you see something?

12:34.521 --> 12:37.655
- Yeah, look at
her email on there.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.891
- Arrii.saffarri.
- Oh, my God.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.960
So this girl's
name is Ari.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.862
So maybe it's like a nickname?
- Her name is Safari,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.163
she goes by Ari?
- Okay.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.431
- Is there any way to, like,

12:46.500 --> 12:47.932
reverse search
an email address?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.801
- There is.
- Yeah?

12:49.870 --> 12:53.171
Arri.saffarri.
All right.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.174
- There we go!

12:56.243 --> 12:58.109
- Whoa in a
Google search it says--

12:58.178 --> 12:59.644
Arianna [bleep].

12:59.713 --> 13:01.780
- And then it says
the-only-Saffarii.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.348
So that's big.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.683
So at the very least I would
say some confidence

13:05.752 --> 13:07.952
that Safari's
real name is Arianna.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.989
- Yeah.
- And she's a real person.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
- What about her,
um, tagged photos?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.493
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Like, that one seems more--

13:15.562 --> 13:18.196
- Oh, that's true.
- 12 hours ago.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.131
Okay.
- Oh, wow. So who's this girl?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.866
Rachel.

13:21.935 --> 13:25.637
Well, this girl seems--
- Human? Real?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.071
- Like a person.
- She commented,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.407
"Love you so much."
- Huh.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.109
- So clearly, like, friend.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.678
- We should probably
message this girl.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.747
- Yeah.
- Good--good find.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.816
- Thank you. I'm learning.
- Wow.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.984
- "Hey, Rachel,"
- Hey, girl.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.986
- "This is Nev from 'Catfish.'
We're doing an episode now

13:42.055 --> 13:43.421
"and your friend Safari
is involved.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.622
"We would love to chat
with you if you can.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.257
Here's my number."

13:46.326 --> 13:48.526
- Let's see if she's in any
other pictures with friends.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.995
- Oh, wait a second. Look.
This picture has got a--a tag.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.363
- J-Alex.

13:52.432 --> 13:56.835
- I guess we could contact
whoever this photographer is.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.803
Okay, cool. Messaged him.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.538
Everything about the page
does feel legit,

14:00.607 --> 14:01.840
she's tagged in a lot
of pictures,

14:01.908 --> 14:03.942
posted by lots of
different accounts.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.678
I can't find an excuse
for if it is her,

14:06.746 --> 14:08.580
why they haven't
at least talked.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.449
- Maybe she's more into just,
like, keeping him on the line.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.717
[phone rings]
Oh!

14:12.786 --> 14:13.751
- All right.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.119
First--first friend.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.688
Hello.

14:16.756 --> 14:20.258
- Yeah, hey, uh, this is Nev.
Who is this?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.427
Jermaine? The photographer?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.563
- Um, well thanks
for getting back to me.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.234
We're trying to find out
a little bit more about Safari,

14:29.302 --> 14:32.103
and we saw that you
had recently posted

14:32.172 --> 14:33.872
some photos of her
that you took.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.108
So we were just curious, you
know, what you know about her.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.145
- You live in California?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.148
- And does she also live
in California?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.669
- Huh.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.972
Wh--do you remember when that
was that her page got hacked?

15:10.844 --> 15:13.211
- But then she got--she got
the account back and she--

15:13.280 --> 15:15.747
it's her--she has--
it's hers, right?

15:19.286 --> 15:22.553
- Hm. Well, cool.
Thanks a lot, man.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.757
- Well, so okay,
so her page was hacked,

15:25.825 --> 15:28.893
but it would have been
before they started talking.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.528
- Yeah.
- I'm sure having been hacked,

15:30.597 --> 15:31.796
she's probably extra careful.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.798
[phone ringing]
- Oh!

15:33.867 --> 15:35.333
- Oh, here's an Arizona.
- Yup. Okay.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.702
- All right, Phoenix.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.805
Hello, this is Nev. Who's this?
- Rachel?

15:40.874 --> 15:43.775
- Rachel, thank you
for getting back to us.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.945
We saw that you
and Safari are friends.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.218
- And you're in Arizona
with her, right?

15:55.689 --> 15:58.756
Is it possible to FaceTime you?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.625
All right, cool.
I'm going to switch it over.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.694
Um, so okay, so cool.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.729
So I know
that her page got hacked.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.031
Her Instagram page got hacked,
like, last year.

16:13.406 --> 16:17.041
- Huh. Has she ever mentioned
a guy named Dallas?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.745
- According to him she sent
him a message and was like,

16:20.814 --> 16:24.515
"Hey," they started texting, so
if we read you the phone number

16:24.584 --> 16:26.517
that this guy has,
can you tell us

16:26.586 --> 16:29.120
if it's Arianna's
actual number?

16:29.189 --> 16:33.424
- So the number we have
is 323-[bleep].

16:36.429 --> 16:39.330
- Huh. So maybe someone
hacked her page again

16:39.399 --> 16:40.765
and she just doesn't
even realize it yet.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.767
- Yeah.
- So, can you give us

16:42.836 --> 16:44.268
Arianna's actual phone number

16:44.337 --> 16:46.904
so that we can let her know
what's going on?

16:46.973 --> 16:49.107
- Go ahead.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.411
- Is that the only
phone number she has?

16:53.480 --> 16:54.912
- Cool, thanks.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.647
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.282
- Bye.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.352
- So the number
that Dallas has

17:01.421 --> 17:05.690
is almost definitely
not the real Arianna.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.692
But why don't we call her?
- Yeah, give a ring.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.594
If it's her it'll be her.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.497
[phone ringing]

17:12.565 --> 17:15.466
<i> - You have reached</i>
<i> the voicemail box of--</i>

17:15.535 --> 17:18.536
- All right, so look, we know
that the page is really her,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.838
but she lives in Arizona.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.607
According to her friend,

17:22.675 --> 17:25.043
the number Dallas
is texting is not her number.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.979
- She was hacked.
- And there's a good chance

17:28.048 --> 17:31.349
Arianna's page got hacked
again, but zooming out

17:31.418 --> 17:32.817
it's almost better for him
if it's not her.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.085
It's going to be a good lesson.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.686
- I think
he's going to be okay.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.824
I think disappointment
can be healthy in tiny doses.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.727
- Yeah. Will Dallas' crush
end up--

17:42.796 --> 17:44.896
together: Crushing him.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.134
- Let's call Dallas,
find out where he's at.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.270
- Let him know--yeah.
[line ringing]

17:53.973 --> 17:55.773
- Hey, we've got some
interesting info.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.109
We should sit down and kind of
figure it out together.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.747
- All right, we can meet you
at the gym, that's fine.

18:02.816 --> 18:06.017
- Perfect.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.186
- What's up?
- What's up?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.687
- Let's see what you've got.
What are you working on?

18:09.756 --> 18:13.458
- I can do--
I can do the--

18:13.526 --> 18:15.560
- He makes it look so easy.
- I mean...

18:15.628 --> 18:18.830
- And then right there.
Whoo, that was--that was--no.

18:18.898 --> 18:19.931
Like,
you're right there though.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.234
- [struggling]

18:23.303 --> 18:24.168
- Yeah!

18:24.237 --> 18:26.104
- Oh-ah!
Whoo!

18:26.172 --> 18:27.672
- She's really in there.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.806
- We got some stuff
to talk about.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.374
- Already, dude?
- Yeah, come on.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.809
Let's sit down.
- What did you find?

18:31.878 --> 18:33.277
- So let's--
- What'd you find?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.146
- We can't leave him hanging
for too long.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.614
- All right.
I'll show you what we found.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.449
All right, so the main piece
of information

18:38.518 --> 18:40.685
obviously is the phone number.
- Yeah.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.821
- When we ran Safari's number,

18:43.890 --> 18:47.758
it came up registered
to William [bleep].

18:47.827 --> 18:49.327
- What?

18:49.395 --> 18:52.330
- Maybe that's her dad but
it's not an exact science.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.299
- That's sometimes what it is,
right?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.735
All right, so after that
we went to her Instagram.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.606
- So we found also on Instagram
it linked an email.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.175
- When we Googled the email,

19:04.244 --> 19:08.112
it brought up the name
Arianna [bleep].

19:08.181 --> 19:10.648
- Arianna [bleep]?
What?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.283
- Which kind of makes sense
because Ari--

19:12.352 --> 19:13.551
- Safari.
- Safari is her stage name--

19:13.620 --> 19:15.486
- Oh, okay.
- Or her nickname.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.555
So this was--this felt like a
breakthrough for us, like, oh,

19:17.624 --> 19:19.290
we actually found out
her real name.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.859
- Yeah, and then we did a look
through her tagged photos

19:21.928 --> 19:24.295
to find, like,
more actual people that

19:24.364 --> 19:26.030
there was some kind
of, like, interaction with her.

19:26.099 --> 19:29.901
- One account that seemed to
know her was this photographer,

19:29.969 --> 19:32.503
J-alexphotos,
and we spoke to him.

19:32.572 --> 19:36.541
- Oh.
- But he seemed to think

19:36.609 --> 19:38.576
she lived in Arizona.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.649
- Oh, what the [bleep]?

19:44.717 --> 19:48.386
- He also told us that, like,
her Instagram was hacked

19:48.454 --> 19:51.389
and also her, like,
iCloud was hacked.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.191
- But it happened awhile ago.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.226
The fact that her account
was getting hacked--

19:55.295 --> 19:56.427
and I think
it happened more than once--

19:56.496 --> 19:58.329
- Somebody could have her--

19:58.398 --> 20:01.666
- The person who did it then--
- Could have done it again.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.302
[sighs]

20:04.370 --> 20:07.271
- All right, so another person
that we found

20:07.340 --> 20:10.508
in her tagged photos
is this girl Rachel.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.642
So she called us.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.579
She has been best friends
with Safari for,

20:14.647 --> 20:17.815
like, the last eight years,
in Arizona.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.650
- Why would she lie
about where she's from?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.653
Even if she's faking me,
she could have--she could--

20:22.722 --> 20:25.389
- Right. She could have just
said she's from Arizona.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.459
So we said, "Look, can we read
you the number that Dallas

20:28.528 --> 20:31.062
has been communicating with and
tell us if that's her number?"

20:31.130 --> 20:32.096
- Okay.
- And we did.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.864
- Uh-huh.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.767
- And she said that is not
the number she has...

20:36.836 --> 20:39.036
- [bleep].
- For Arianna.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.505
- Bro, what the hell, bro.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.642
Don't tell me that, dude.
What?

20:44.711 --> 20:48.646
- So then she gave us
Arianna's "real" number.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.781
We called the number.
We didn't get an answer.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.882
So that's where we're at.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.751
- Bro, that's a weird thing.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.186
- It would appear--

20:55.255 --> 20:56.821
I really think this is
the only possibility--

20:56.889 --> 21:01.425
Somehow her page was hacked--
- Okay, well...

21:03.162 --> 21:05.329
- In the meantime though I
think it probably makes sense

21:05.398 --> 21:08.065
just to message
the number you have.

21:08.134 --> 21:14.505
"Hey, give me a call
when you can.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.940
Thanks."

21:16.009 --> 21:19.110
All right, I'm sending this
to the number you have.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.779
So now we've got
texts out to both--

21:21.848 --> 21:23.447
- Options. [laughing]

21:23.516 --> 21:26.150
- I'm scared.
- We can also send her a DM.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.752
- That too.

21:27.820 --> 21:32.623
- "Hey, I'm trying to
get in touch with..."

21:32.692 --> 21:34.625
All right, I'm sending her
a DM, too.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.328
- That [bleep]'s weird,
the numbers thing.

21:37.397 --> 21:41.098
Ugh. I don't know.
- Oh, she just wrote back.

21:41.167 --> 21:43.267
"Hey, I'm at work, can't talk."

21:43.336 --> 21:45.336
- [laughs] That's her reply
to me all the time.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.505
- Can you chat here
for a second?

21:47.573 --> 21:49.373
- No.
- No, she says, "No."

21:49.442 --> 21:52.310
I can't. Work rules. Hold on,
let me see what I can do."

21:52.378 --> 21:54.078
At least we're talking
to her on her page.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.380
- Which we know is her.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.848
- So we're very close
to finding out

21:57.917 --> 21:58.983
the truth right now.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.385
- [bleep].

22:01.454 --> 22:03.888
This is like
a roller coaster.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.290
- Oh! Whoa, whoa.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.126
She just sent me a picture.
Is that her? What?

22:11.964 --> 22:14.398
- Oh! Whoa, whoa.
She just sent me a picture.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.201
Is that her? What?
Hold on a second.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.737
That says, "Hey, Nev,
it's Safari.

22:19.806 --> 22:23.441
I'm real. Tell Dallas I'll talk
to him later about all this."

22:23.509 --> 22:24.508
- What?
This is real?

22:24.577 --> 22:26.077
- That doesn't make sense.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.545
- I don't even know
if this is real, though.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.347
- No, that's too quick
to have a sign ready

22:29.415 --> 22:31.282
and to have a picture after
you say you can't talk.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.651
No, that's sketchy.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
- I don't know, you can get
a pen out and you can--

22:35.788 --> 22:37.054
- That's pretty fast.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.956
Either someone's
really good at Photoshop--

22:39.025 --> 22:41.859
It's hard to know. I'm looking
to see if, like, it looks like,

22:41.928 --> 22:44.962
like someone cut around her
finger and, like, put some--

22:45.031 --> 22:47.098
- How are you going to do that
but not be able to FaceTime me?

22:47.166 --> 22:48.532
That don't make--

22:48.601 --> 22:51.235
- Well maybe she has
just been embarrassed

22:51.304 --> 22:53.237
about living in Arizona?
- Yeah.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.805
- What?!
- It's almost hard to believe.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.109
Like, wow. Uh, okay.

22:58.177 --> 23:02.313
- "Hope we can help you guys

23:02.382 --> 23:04.482
finally meet up."

23:04.550 --> 23:06.784
I guess we'll figure out
a way to meet up with her.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.987
- Hold on, I can't talk.
Hold on. Oh, picture.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.689
- Well sh--I guess she's not
supposed to be on her phone

23:11.758 --> 23:13.357
but she, like,
quickly wrote this,

23:13.426 --> 23:15.593
snapped a picture outside,
but that was fast.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.695
All right, let's do a test.
Let's do a test.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.363
If that was--okay,
it was two minutes.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.899
Set a timer for two minutes.
- All right.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.703
- Okay.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.138
- Go.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.906
- All right, I'm not going
to run because I'm at work.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.276
I can't, like, go crazy.
I got to, like--I have to look

23:32.345 --> 23:34.044
like I'm responsible
and, like--okay.

23:34.113 --> 23:39.116
Grab the pad and paper,
bring it back to my desk--

23:39.185 --> 23:41.085
"Be right with you,"
a customer.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.421
- Yup. Yup.
- Okay.

23:43.489 --> 23:50.261
"Hey, Nev." And then she did,
like, a cute thing.

23:50.329 --> 23:53.464
"It's Safari."

23:53.533 --> 23:55.599
And she really did
write it cute.

23:55.668 --> 24:00.271
"Tell Dallas I'll talk to--"

24:00.339 --> 24:02.339
- All right, one minute.
- Ooh.

24:02.408 --> 24:06.010
"...him later
about all of this.

24:06.078 --> 24:09.547
LOL."
Okay, let's go outside.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.015
- 40 seconds.
- Take a picture.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.883
- Oh, we gotta go.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.319
[laughter]

24:15.388 --> 24:18.022
- And this is quick,
for her to do it this quick.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.024
All right, here we go. We got,
like, a corner right here.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.325
- Okay.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.394
- And you have to do
your cute--

24:24.096 --> 24:26.130
- 20 seconds.
- Okay.

24:26.199 --> 24:27.665
It's doable but that was fast.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.935
- Also, as a girl,
you have at least ten options.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.604
- Exactly.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.272
- And she had to find
a cute spot.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.776
All right, well--so I don't
know what to tell you, man,

24:38.845 --> 24:42.813
but [laughing] something--
something's going on.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.315
She may have been,
like, oh, man,

24:44.383 --> 24:45.649
Nev's trying
to figure this out.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.651
I better, like,
send him something.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.154
But then why not
send that to me

24:50.223 --> 24:52.356
unless she's been hacked,
right?

24:52.425 --> 24:54.825
Maybe the hacker
has her [bleep]

24:54.894 --> 24:56.760
and has Photoshopped
her, like, old photos

24:56.829 --> 24:58.562
and was like,
"I better send that to him."

24:58.631 --> 24:59.997
- That's some
real deal effort.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.665
- Anything is possible.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.635
All right, so look, she said
she was going to hit you up,

25:04.704 --> 25:07.037
so just keep--
just keep me posted.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.639
- All right, man.
- Can't wait.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.574
- Good seeing you again.
Thanks for killing me earlier.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.142
- Bye.
- So sketched out right now.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.912
Bro, it's like, beyond me.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.849
- Wow. I did not
see that coming.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.218
- If it is her, then, like,
so many opportunities

25:21.287 --> 25:22.887
for her to just been like,

25:22.955 --> 25:24.955
"Hey, I'm actually staying
in Arizona right now," or--

25:25.024 --> 25:29.159
- What if she genuinely
likes the game of it?

25:29.228 --> 25:30.761
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

25:30.830 --> 25:35.065
Like, she has to kind of have
everyone respond on her time.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.835
It's all a bit of,
like, teasing and it does feel

25:37.904 --> 25:41.071
like she's a little bit
of the puppet master.

25:46.445 --> 25:51.882
- All right. Let's see
if we've got anything here.

25:51.951 --> 25:55.553
Really? Nothing?

25:55.621 --> 25:57.121
All right, no update yet.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.556
- Good morning.

25:58.624 --> 26:00.257
- Just waiting
for Nev to hit you?

26:00.326 --> 26:03.994
- Yeah. Well, I'm just waiting
to kind of hear

26:04.063 --> 26:07.298
what the next move is.

26:07.366 --> 26:11.035
It's kind of in her hands
until we kind of hear.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.636
I think ideally it'd be great

26:12.705 --> 26:15.339
to be able to help get them
together and--and have,

26:15.408 --> 26:17.274
like, a face to face...
- See what's up.

26:17.343 --> 26:20.311
- Meeting and just kind of
know what's up and...

26:20.379 --> 26:22.980
One way or another,
like, help them...

26:23.049 --> 26:26.317
- Find some sort of resolution.
- Move from this. Yeah, yeah.

26:27.987 --> 26:34.425
- All right, so I just got
a text finally from Safari.

26:34.493 --> 26:37.428
- "Hey, Dallas.
I thought about this a lot.

26:37.496 --> 26:40.364
"Sorry it took so long
to respond.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.967
"There are some things
I need to clear up.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.903
I need to meet you
somewhere by you."

26:45.972 --> 26:48.539
[phone ringing]
- Oh!

26:49.709 --> 26:51.108
Yo.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.447
"I need to meet up
somewhere by you."

26:56.515 --> 26:59.316
- Let's see how this goes.
Let's do it.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.922
- I am, a little bit.
But I'm excited, too.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.156
- See you soon.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.225
<i> - ♪ Tell me little lies ♪</i>

27:08.294 --> 27:10.527
- Boom! We got it.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.931
- Here we go.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.499
- Good morning.

27:15.568 --> 27:17.801
Dallas got a text
this morning from Safari,

27:17.870 --> 27:20.504
so I'm going to come pick
you up and then

27:20.573 --> 27:22.439
we'll go meet Dallas.
<i> - Cool.</i>

27:22.508 --> 27:24.541
- There she is.
<i> - ♪ Tell me what ♪</i>

27:24.610 --> 27:26.410
- So we got some stuff.
- We have contact.

27:26.479 --> 27:31.148
<i> - ♪ I love it when you</i>
<i> whisper in my ear ♪</i>

27:31.217 --> 27:33.684
- I really don't know
what it's going to be.

27:33.753 --> 27:37.121
- I just can't help but feel
there's some giant surprise.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.223
All right,
let's get our man.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.960
Yo, yo, yo.
- Hello?

27:43.029 --> 27:45.062
- Hey! Come on in!
- Hi!

27:45.131 --> 27:47.231
- Yo.
- How you doing?

27:47.299 --> 27:49.466
- Good morning!
Good morning.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.669
- 'Sup my brother.
You all right?

27:51.737 --> 27:54.338
- We're good, we're good.
How you feeling?

27:54.407 --> 27:57.207
- Awkward and nervous
and weird.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.610
- So wait, so she texted you
this morning.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.412
- Yeah.
- And then you responded.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.682
- Yeah, but I didn't
hear back so...

28:04.750 --> 28:06.350
Now I'm just like,

28:06.419 --> 28:08.786
"Is this for real
going to happen, like--?"

28:08.854 --> 28:11.422
- Dude, send another text
and just say, "We're ready."

28:11.490 --> 28:12.790
Yeah, "We're here,
we're ready."

28:12.858 --> 28:14.758
There's a park close by
that we could go to.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.027
- All right.
- Say, like, "We got a spot

28:17.096 --> 28:19.029
"near us
that you could meet us at.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.664
A park near us." Yeah.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.866
- All right.
- All right, so?

28:22.935 --> 28:24.268
- Sent.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.335
- Interesting. I never--
I didn't realize

28:25.404 --> 28:26.670
when you read it to me.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.639
"I need to meet up
somewhere by you."

28:28.708 --> 28:30.808
"Need to meet up."
Like, so what does that--

28:30.876 --> 28:32.576
- Yeah, yeah.
- What does that mean?

28:32.645 --> 28:34.778
Like, she can't meet up
somewhere by her?

28:34.847 --> 28:36.780
- Oh, yeah.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.615
- It's a stronger way
of phrasing.

28:38.684 --> 28:41.652
- Oh, there we go.
"I can be there soon.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.287
If that's cool with you."
- And smiley face.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.688
- So that's good.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.724
- But yeah, breaking down
this text is scaring me.

28:46.792 --> 28:50.561
- Well, so I just feel like
if I had to make an assessment

28:50.629 --> 28:52.362
of that text I'd think, okay,
if it's true that she lives

28:52.431 --> 28:55.032
in Arizona,
which it seems that she does,

28:55.101 --> 28:57.401
there's some kind of
situation going on in Arizona.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.603
Now, it might just be that
she doesn't want you to know

28:59.672 --> 29:01.405
she lives at home
with her parents?

29:01.474 --> 29:03.540
Or she's got,
like, a "situation"

29:03.609 --> 29:05.943
situation in Arizona.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.778
- Like a guy.
- Yeah.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.781
Or someone else
had access to her page,

29:10.850 --> 29:12.549
whether they hacked it
or it was a friend.

29:12.618 --> 29:16.153
I don't know.
- Why won't she call me?

29:16.222 --> 29:18.689
- All right, let's do it.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.859
So she's in LA.
- She is in LA.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.295
Where is she staying?
- That's--that's the mystery.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.364
- It's those
high-stress moments

29:27.433 --> 29:29.133
that always lead
to the best days.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.636
- [sighs]
The anticipation.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.773
[shudders]

29:35.841 --> 29:39.977
- Here we are.
- We're here. I'm scared.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.712
- Let's do it.

29:42.515 --> 29:45.649
- [groaning] Nervous.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.720
- Find a nice little quiet
corner back here.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.457
- Nice little quite corner.
- So now we wait.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.362
- [bleep], I'm nervous.

29:58.430 --> 30:02.399
- See a guy over here.
- No, don't do that to me.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.201
- Shirtless man.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.703
I think this guy
is walking this way.

30:06.772 --> 30:09.640
- He better not walk--stay
over there with your dog.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.642
I like your dog, though.
Nice dog.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.812
- Oh, okay. He's--he's--he's
just taking a dog for a walk.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.981
- Yo, my heart
is acting [bleep].

30:18.050 --> 30:21.451
My heart is [bleep] going.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.887
- Who is this guy?
- Where?

30:25.424 --> 30:27.491
- I swear--no, dude.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.427
It's not, it's not,
it's no way that...

30:31.630 --> 30:33.096
I've seen that [bleep]
guy before.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.531
- You've seen him before?
- I've seen him before.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.099
That better not be him.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.101
- Where--how--where have you
seen that guy before?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.837
- Just, like, living in LA.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.138
- No. Seriously?

30:41.207 --> 30:43.173
- I swear it better not
be that [bleep] guy.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.042
Don't come over here, dude.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.277
- It looks like
he's coming over here.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.478
He's walking back
this direction--

30:48.547 --> 30:50.647
- [bleep] my life, bro.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.383
I swear. Y'all are
[bleep] kidding, bro.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.855
- I've seen that [bleep]
guy before.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.523
- You've seen him before?
- I've seen him before.

30:59.592 --> 31:00.858
That better not be him.
- Wait, where--how--

31:00.926 --> 31:02.459
Where have you seen
that guy before?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.761
- Just, like, living in LA.
- No. Seriously?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.563
- I swear it better not
be that [bleep] guy.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.799
Don't come over here, dude.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.534
- It looks like
he's coming over here.

31:10.603 --> 31:11.602
He's walking back
this direction--

31:11.670 --> 31:13.637
- [bleep] my life, bro.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.207
I swear--y'all are [bleep]
kidding, bro.

31:17.276 --> 31:20.143
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.179
- Oh, my gosh, bro.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.015
- So what's your name?
- William.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.917
- Dude!
What the [bleep], bro.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.385
- I'm Tallulah.
- Nice to meet you.

31:28.454 --> 31:32.489
- Nah, bro.
- So...

31:32.558 --> 31:33.924
- I [bleep] knew it was
some bull[bleep].

31:33.993 --> 31:35.826
This is beyond me, bro.
- Hold on, wait.

31:35.895 --> 31:38.428
Let's just get an explanation.
So what's going on?

31:38.497 --> 31:40.998
- I saw him a few times,
like, around town.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.834
SlutWalk a few times
and some Amber Rose events.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.670
- Okay, so you have some
mutual social--

31:46.739 --> 31:48.605
- Yeah, I've seen him
a few times.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.274
And I was like, you know,

31:50.342 --> 31:51.775
I thought he was
a really hot guy

31:51.844 --> 31:53.610
and he's posting all
these photos of his, like,

31:53.679 --> 31:57.748
ass on Instagram
and Tumblr and whatever,

31:57.816 --> 32:01.718
and I was with my friend Safari
and we were all on social media

32:01.787 --> 32:04.488
drunk and she was like, "You
should just totally DM him,"

32:04.556 --> 32:06.089
and I'm like, "Oh, my God
I'm so nervous.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.659
I couldn't do such a thing.
Like, I don't think he's gay."

32:08.727 --> 32:10.627
She's like, "Well just
look how he's posting

32:10.696 --> 32:11.995
"his photos on Instagram.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.064
"He's got an OnlyFans page
that he uses

32:14.133 --> 32:17.200
to, you know,
target the gay community."

32:17.269 --> 32:19.636
- Wait a second--OnlyFans?
What's that?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.972
- Dallas is always posting
his nudes.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.007
Um, you can subscribe
to his stuff.

32:24.076 --> 32:27.344
- And people subscribe and
he'll post special content?

32:27.413 --> 32:30.614
Do you have subscribers?
- Yeah.

32:32.217 --> 32:35.852
And Safari said, "Why don't
I just give him my number

32:35.921 --> 32:37.955
and then it's really
your number."

32:38.023 --> 32:39.690
- Who was he texting with?
- Me.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.858
- But then why approach him
as a woman?

32:41.927 --> 32:45.095
- I feel like girls can make
a guy feel comfortable.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.831
Like, let's say
a threesome or a foursome.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.032
You know, I could have been

32:49.101 --> 32:51.635
that fourth person
in his threesome.

32:51.704 --> 32:55.005
- That [bleep] is weird, bro.
I'm sorry.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.307
- So, you asked
about a threesome.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.743
He even said he would be down.

32:59.812 --> 33:03.146
Then you suggested
the roommate, not you.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.448
- But he was okay with that.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.716
- Why not suggest yourself
or then say,

33:05.784 --> 33:07.184
"Okay, Safari,
let's go meet him."

33:07.252 --> 33:08.518
Like, why not see
if it could actually happen.

33:08.587 --> 33:09.786
- We were going to do that

33:09.855 --> 33:11.321
and then "Catfish"
came out of nowhere.

33:11.390 --> 33:15.158
- Okay, so the plan was--
- To eventually get to that.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.927
- Ahh! [laughing]
- These guys are so--

33:16.996 --> 33:19.663
- This is beyond me, bro.
- Like, these guys are so--

33:19.732 --> 33:21.798
- Most of his fans are gay.

33:21.867 --> 33:25.002
- But that ain't got nothing
to do with what I like.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.770
- It kind of feels like
you're trying to blame him

33:26.839 --> 33:28.205
for the fact that you lied.

33:28.273 --> 33:29.473
- No, and it's not lying.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.041
I'm not pretending
to be someone.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.909
- You've been pretending to be
Safari for two months.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.245
- You a catfish, catfish, bro.
- No.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.980
- Wait a second, but you--
- No, no, no, no.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.116
- Wait, but surely
you understand that it still

33:39.184 --> 33:42.786
feels like you don't think
you did anything wrong.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.855
- I didn't do anything
maliciously.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.356
I wasn't asking for money.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.025
- That's true.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.727
- So, if I wasn't doing none of
those things, I don't feel like

33:50.796 --> 33:52.195
in a sense
if I was doing any harm.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.665
We didn't mean
for someone to call "Catfish."

33:55.734 --> 33:58.068
- Just ask me, be like, "Bro,
are you gay? Do you get down?"

33:58.137 --> 34:00.137
I'd be like, "No." It would
have ended right there.

34:00.205 --> 34:04.574
- Dallas, calm down. Like,
if you're not [bleep] gay--

34:04.643 --> 34:05.742
- He's allowed to have
his feelings.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.778
You have to, like, you know--

34:12.284 --> 34:14.785
- But I think that's a really
unfair argument because I think

34:14.853 --> 34:16.887
that then you're making
a decision for him.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.689
I think you could kind of
say that like, you know,

34:19.758 --> 34:21.658
if a girl is dressed
a certain way,

34:21.727 --> 34:23.427
then that means something
about them.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.996
- I think it's fair to say that
it would be easy to interpret

34:26.065 --> 34:30.901
his social media presence as
someone who might be bisexual.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.469
- Yes, of course.
- Whatever.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.938
- I still don't think that
makes it okay, though.

34:35.007 --> 34:38.842
- We were going to go to find
out where Dallas lives,

34:38.911 --> 34:41.278
arrange a date, and to talk to
him about the situation,

34:41.346 --> 34:42.679
get him comfortable.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.914
- Okay, but he wanted
to meet up so bad.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.682
Why not meet up
all these months?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.417
- I already knew you mutually,
you should have just been like,

34:47.486 --> 34:48.919
"Yo, let's hang out."
- Because I wanted to do it

34:48.987 --> 34:50.153
with Safari,
but she was always gone.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.788
- So she's just
not in LA a lot.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.423
- Yeah, I didn't want
to do it by myself.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.425
We were supposed to
all hang out and talk about it.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.260
She was going to introduce me
as her friend.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.097
- Right, and then from there--
- And then from there,

35:00.165 --> 35:02.199
she would have faded off
away eventually

35:02.267 --> 35:04.334
and then me and him would have
got on a personal relationship.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.603
Who knows would have happened.
But now we have--

35:06.672 --> 35:07.671
- Not that!

35:07.739 --> 35:09.005
- Dallas, come on.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.274
I apologize
if it came off wrong.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.511
Um, Safari can tell you her
side of the story.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.812
- Where is Safari?

35:15.881 --> 35:17.681
- Safari is at
her friend's house.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.416
- In LA or is she
in Arizona?

35:19.485 --> 35:20.984
- In LA.
- She is in LA.

35:21.053 --> 35:22.586
- If you want
to talk to her about it.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.154
- Okay, great.
So she's here.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.089
- I mean, yeah.
I would like to hear from her.

35:26.158 --> 35:30.927
- I will go and call Safari
and send you guys the address.

35:30.996 --> 35:33.430
- All right, so text us
where to meet you and Safari.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.900
- Okay, for sure I will.
- All right, thanks.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.970
- That's crazy.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.938
I knew some [bleep] was up.

35:42.007 --> 35:45.242
- I'm curious to know if
Safari's story is different.

35:45.310 --> 35:49.112
She may not even necessarily
really know how far it went.

35:54.953 --> 35:58.054
- All right,
we just got an address.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.390
Let's go meet the real Safari.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.526
- Definitely curious to hear
her point of view.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.228
- I'm so curious, yeah.

36:05.297 --> 36:08.165
- Okay.
- Let the awkwardness begin.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.369
- Hey.
- Hello, guys.

36:12.437 --> 36:13.703
Come on in. Welcome.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.507
- Oh, okay.
- There, [bleep].

36:17.576 --> 36:20.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.846
- In the flesh.
- Hi, what's up.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.181
Safari.
- Nice to meet you.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.082
- Hi, Tallulah.
Nice to meet you.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.717
- The real you. Hi.
- This is Dallas.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.353
- Safari. Hi, Dallas.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.022
- What's up?
- Hi.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.791
- Wow.
- This is awkward.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.760
- Well the first--
first thing is just,

36:36.828 --> 36:39.196
can you just sort of explain
how it all kind of went down?

36:39.264 --> 36:41.831
- Yeah, so I've been friends
with William for, like,

36:41.900 --> 36:43.300
about a year and a half now,

36:43.368 --> 36:45.302
and he had shown me
your pictures.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.238
- You are fine,
so in my heart I thought,

36:48.307 --> 36:50.006
"I'm going to help
my friend," and I said,

36:50.075 --> 36:52.275
"You can use my photos,"
and so I messaged Dallas.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.411
When you first started
talking, that was me.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.447
I said, "Trust me,
I got plenty of photos.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.050
"If you really like this boy,
I'll help you get him,

37:00.118 --> 37:01.818
but I can't be
staying here a lot."

37:01.887 --> 37:04.487
- Well, wait, so what was
the plan that you--'cause

37:04.556 --> 37:07.290
talking to him from your
account isn't "getting" him,

37:07.359 --> 37:08.658
so how--did you--

37:08.727 --> 37:11.161
- The plan was for me
to message him.

37:11.230 --> 37:14.064
He then was going
to text "me"--William--

37:14.132 --> 37:15.966
then they were going
to sit there and talk.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.801
Eventually I was going
to come out here.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.803
That's why I sent William
the photos,

37:19.871 --> 37:21.104
and then we'd all get
together

37:21.173 --> 37:22.505
and I would
just play matchmaker.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.975
- Did you ever have any,
kind of, like, feelings?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.944
- I never had a genuine
feeling for you.

37:28.013 --> 37:30.580
You are attractive, you're
handsome, there's nothing--

37:30.649 --> 37:32.515
- He's okay.
[laughter]

37:32.584 --> 37:34.084
- Nev says you're okay.
- Don't gas him up, girl.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.119
- I hate him. I hate him.
- I know, right?

37:36.188 --> 37:38.822
- But I was doing this
for a friend's sake.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.824
Like, I couldn't see myself
with you.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.026
But William, I could see.

37:43.095 --> 37:46.062
- But would you have
participated in a threesome

37:46.131 --> 37:48.231
with Dallas in an effort
to sort of tee him up

37:48.300 --> 37:51.001
if it meant helping him and
him, like, be intimate?

37:51.069 --> 37:52.535
- Yeah, I'm a freak.
Yeah.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.672
- I'm like--I'm a--I'm a freak.
So, like...

37:55.741 --> 37:57.774
- [bleep].
- That's so funny.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.610
- This is crazy, man.
- Dallas.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.346
I'm not telling you that what
you're doing is wrong,

38:03.415 --> 38:05.749
but the way your content is on
your Instagram,

38:05.817 --> 38:10.287
it seems like you're reaching
out to a certain sexuality.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.389
Like, you're reaching towards
the gay community

38:12.457 --> 38:14.457
in order to make money on,
like, your premium.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.661
'Cause I have, like,
an OnlyFans type of thing, too,

38:17.729 --> 38:19.396
and I have women subscribers
and male.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.599
But, like, my sexuality
is I want to be with both.

38:22.668 --> 38:27.470
- I don't agree with you guys
when it comes to the fact

38:27.539 --> 38:32.175
that, like, because Dallas
caters to a homosexual fanbase,

38:32.244 --> 38:35.278
it, like, puts some
of the responsibility--

38:35.347 --> 38:36.913
Like I don't--
I don't get that.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.348
- I just feel like there's
opportunity.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.883
That's all I'm saying.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.352
- I can totally get, like,
the thought process,

38:42.421 --> 38:45.288
but I think it's kind of not
your place

38:45.357 --> 38:49.225
to put someone in
that position to explore that.

38:49.294 --> 38:52.529
- Dallas, if this is how you
really feel, we respect that,

38:52.597 --> 38:54.931
and I respect that as an
individual and I apologize

38:55.000 --> 38:57.500
if I made you feel
any type of way.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.135
- I'm not a grudge holder.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.304
I mean, it's [bleep] up
but I'm like, it's all good.

39:01.373 --> 39:05.108
Thanks for the clarity.
The clarity is awesome.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.377
- Sorry we kind
of cock-blocked.

39:07.446 --> 39:08.845
- It's okay.

39:08.914 --> 39:12.215
- All right, well walk us out
and we'll say our good-byes.

39:12.284 --> 39:13.817
- All right.
- All right.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.819
- It was nice to meet you.
- Really nice to meet you.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.087
- Nice to see you guys.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.662
- That went as well
as it--yeah.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.163
- It was pretty smooth.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.265
- Are you mad
at her for, like--

39:29.334 --> 39:33.370
- I'm mad that she would help
somebody [bleep] waste my time.

39:33.438 --> 39:37.140
But I'm kind of relieved
that I just know something now.

39:37.209 --> 39:40.910

39:43.248 --> 39:45.148

39:46.551 --> 39:48.351
What's been going on since
we last saw you?

39:48.420 --> 39:50.587
<i> - I'm kind of just focusing</i>
<i> on my career and stuff.</i>

39:50.655 --> 39:52.222

39:52.290 --> 39:53.623
<i> - No, I haven't seen him.</i>

39:53.692 --> 39:54.924

40:01.366 --> 40:03.199
- Nice. Anything you want us
to say to William

40:03.268 --> 40:04.734
when we talk to him?

40:04.803 --> 40:06.803
<i> - Just tell him to not</i>

40:06.872 --> 40:09.239
<i> and just be real, like, you</i>
<i> know, be proud of who you are.</i>

40:09.307 --> 40:11.241

Hopefully I'll see you around.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.810

40:13.879 --> 40:16.079

<i> - Bye.</i>

40:17.182 --> 40:19.582

- What's up, William?

40:19.651 --> 40:20.817
<i> - What's popping?</i>

40:20.886 --> 40:22.252
- You seem to be
in a great mood.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.187
<i> - Always.</i>
- Do you think that the way

40:24.256 --> 40:26.856
things went down has changed
your feelings about him?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.925
Because you seemed to really
like him, you seemed to think--

40:28.994 --> 40:31.227
<i> - I really do like him still</i>
<i> but at the end of the day</i>

40:31.296 --> 40:33.329

<i> about anything else besides</i>

40:33.398 --> 40:35.432

40:35.500 --> 40:37.734

<i> This is school, honey.</i>

40:37.803 --> 40:39.803
- You're happy?

40:39.871 --> 40:41.671

40:41.740 --> 40:44.240
<i> - Mr. Right comes along and,</i>

40:46.111 --> 40:47.911
<i> But you know, like...</i>

40:49.114 --> 40:50.747
- All right, well,
good luck with that.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.316
<i> - Aww, thanks, you guys.</i>
- Say hi to Safari for me.

40:53.385 --> 40:55.518
<i> - I will tell her that you</i>

40:55.587 --> 40:57.120
- Exactly.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.922
- [laughing]
<i> - All right, bye.</i>

40:58.990 --> 41:00.924
- All right, Will. Bye.
- Bye.

41:02.093 --> 41:02.559
<i> - Aubrey has been</i>
<i> talking to this guy</i>

41:03.428 --> 41:04.761
<i> named Brian on Snapchat.</i>

41:04.830 --> 41:06.362
It's crazy,
he goes to the same school,

41:06.431 --> 41:08.431
and they've never
come across each other?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.467
- I tried to meet up with him
at the rec. He wasn't there.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.702
- Or he was there
but you weren't looking

41:12.771 --> 41:13.970
for the right guy.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.306
Park is about
six minutes away.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.441
Oh, who's this?

41:18.510 --> 41:20.543
- Oh, [bleep].
- What the [bleep]?
