00:26.780 --> 00:28.570
Hey there.

00:28.610 --> 00:31.920
I heard you coming up the road.

00:32.610 --> 00:35.090
Long time since we had anyone
over in these parts.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.660
I'm Jeanie.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.400
I live in
the next property over.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.140
- Anna.
- Moving in or moving out?

00:41.190 --> 00:43.410
- I'm sorry?
- The boxes.

00:43.450 --> 00:48.280
Oh, I'm just keeping
some things here for awhile.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.460
Were you on a hike?

00:51.500 --> 00:55.070
No, we've had some teenagers
up in this neck of the woods.

00:55.110 --> 00:56.770
You know, drinking
and setting fires.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.550
I thought maybe
you were one of them.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.990
My sister tells me that I
should mind my own business,

01:01.030 --> 01:04.730
but I like to know what's
going on around me, that's all.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.130
Do you live by yourself?

01:06.170 --> 01:08.870
Uh-huh, yeah, me and my dogs.

01:08.910 --> 01:11.106
Would you mind giving me
a hand with something, Jeanie?

01:11.130 --> 01:12.570
Sure, sure.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.390
There's a box there
that's too heavy for me

01:14.440 --> 01:16.140
to get by myself.
Yeah?

01:16.180 --> 01:18.140
- That one right there.
- This one here?

01:18.180 --> 01:20.140
Do you mind just
sliding that over to me?

01:20.180 --> 01:21.620
Well, that ain't so bad.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.820
I know what you did.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.650
What's that?

01:53.690 --> 01:55.780
You tried to access
classified intelligence

01:55.830 --> 01:58.530
on Mikhail Tal after
I explicitly told you not to.

01:58.570 --> 02:01.570
I didn't try
to access those files.

02:03.270 --> 02:05.620
Anna Cruz did.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.449
- And why would she do that?
- Because she's a mole.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.800
That intel was a list of
every paid informant on Tal.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.280
Cruz knew how valuable
that would be for him,

02:16.330 --> 02:18.810
so I baited her.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.810
I dangled the Tal file
in front of her

02:20.850 --> 02:23.160
because I felt what
you're starting to feel now

02:23.200 --> 02:25.250
which is doubt.

02:25.290 --> 02:27.290
She clawed her way
into this building

02:27.340 --> 02:29.430
and she clawed her way into you.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.650
What's that supposed to mean?

02:35.210 --> 02:37.220
You're her target.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.830
Can you not see that?

02:39.870 --> 02:42.220
She's been manipulating you
from the moment she met you.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.310
Cruz gained access
to this building and to you

02:44.350 --> 02:46.830
because she pretended
to be a victim

02:46.880 --> 02:48.140
in one of the Tal attacks,

02:48.180 --> 02:50.490
gathering intelligence
for him for weeks.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.320
No, you're lying.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.760
Twice Tal assassinated
multiple CIA operatives

02:54.800 --> 02:57.500
to end an investigation
into him.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.460
Is it really so farfetched
that he would plant

02:59.500 --> 03:01.240
a mole inside the FBI?

03:01.280 --> 03:02.850
If that were true,
that means Cruz

03:02.890 --> 03:04.330
would've faked
her own kidnapping.

03:04.370 --> 03:05.850
- Yes.
- That means she had a hand

03:05.900 --> 03:07.070
in a bombing that killed

03:07.120 --> 03:08.470
14 of her own colleagues.

03:08.510 --> 03:09.940
And what about Viktor Nemec?

03:09.990 --> 03:12.380
Did he commit suicide or did
she kill him right here

03:12.430 --> 03:14.910
in this building
to prevent him from talking?

03:14.950 --> 03:16.860
This is so hard to believe,

03:16.910 --> 03:19.390
what I'm telling you is true.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.220
Cruz works for Tal.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.890
Will, what are you doing here?

03:44.940 --> 03:46.500
Is everything okay?

03:46.550 --> 03:48.160
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

03:48.200 --> 03:52.200
Uh, no. I'm just surprised
to see you here, that's all.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.560
Did you want to come in?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
Sure.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.960
How you been, Anna?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.390
I'm good.
Why?

04:08.440 --> 04:10.090
I've just been worried
about you.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.140
- Why are you worried about me?
- I don't know.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.790
I mean, it's only been
about a month since the bombing

04:14.840 --> 04:17.269
and I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.360
That's sweet of you,

04:19.410 --> 04:20.970
but I'm fine.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.100
I didn't make a mistake
bringing you into the FBI

04:23.150 --> 04:24.580
to work with me?

04:24.630 --> 04:27.460
No. Will, working with you
has been the only thing

04:27.500 --> 04:29.110
that's kept me sane.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.290
Good.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.940
I'm gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.940
- Sure.
- Okay.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.650
Nice place.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.430
Thank you!

04:44.470 --> 04:46.260
How long have you lived here?

04:46.300 --> 04:48.830
Uh, two years.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.360
Here you go.

05:04.410 --> 05:07.760
It's not tea but I thought
a drink sounded better anyway.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.110
Don't you think?
I do.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.680
Mmm. I feel bad you trekked
across town to check on me.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.160
You could've just called.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.380
I wanted to see you.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.990
- Why did you want to see me?
- To see what I needed to do

05:25.040 --> 05:26.730
to help you.

05:26.780 --> 05:29.000
You've already helped so much.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.700
Letting me investigate Tal

05:31.740 --> 05:35.660
it's helped me in ways
you can't imagine.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.530
Something's bothering you.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.400
What makes you say that?

05:42.450 --> 05:44.620
Just a hunch, I guess.

05:45.540 --> 05:46.840
I just keep thinking

05:46.880 --> 05:48.710
about all the damage
that Tal has done.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.630
It's not just the lives
that he takes,

05:50.670 --> 05:53.110
it's the people he leaves
behind that suffer too.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.020
Me, you.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.550
I know what you've
been doing, Anna.

06:00.510 --> 06:03.160
The first one in the office
every morning,

06:03.200 --> 06:04.860
last one to leave.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.430
Work is supposed
to be a distraction,

06:06.470 --> 06:07.820
it's not a cure.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.250
You're right.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.040
But for now,

06:11.080 --> 06:13.950
it gives me solace being able
to hunt the man down

06:14.000 --> 06:15.700
that killed my friends.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.700
The man who killed Laine.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.180
I was waiting to tell
you about a lead I found

06:23.220 --> 06:24.530
until I had more to show you.

06:24.570 --> 06:26.400
But since you're here...

06:26.450 --> 06:27.880
What is it?

06:27.930 --> 06:30.710
Uh, I was looking into
Viktor Nemec's financials

06:30.750 --> 06:33.540
and I saw that he had a PO box
in Elkins, West Virginia

06:33.580 --> 06:35.590
that he rented.
Nemec lives in New York.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.670
Why would he have a PO box
in West Virginia?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.760
Exactly my question,

06:39.810 --> 06:42.900
but what was intriguing
was the timing.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.420
He rented it out one month
before the Wall Street bombing.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.600
So you think that the PO box

06:47.640 --> 06:49.770
has some type of connection
to Tal?

06:49.820 --> 06:52.470
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to find out.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.260
Then go ahead.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.480
I'd be curious to see
what comes out of it.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.920
Thanks for coming by, Will.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.580
It's comforting to know
I have a friend like you.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.400
Have a good night.

07:12.450 --> 07:13.930
Good night.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.460
Daniel, call the team

07:26.510 --> 07:28.550
and have them meet
at my place in 20 minutes.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.120
We have a breach.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.380
You're sure Cruz is working
for Tal?

07:34.430 --> 07:35.626
She was flagged trying to access

07:35.650 --> 07:37.080
some confidential files on him.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.690
The only reason why
she'd want that type

07:38.740 --> 07:40.650
of intelligence is
if she was reporting it

07:40.690 --> 07:43.610
back to him.
You set up a sting?

07:43.650 --> 07:45.920
Not me. Shepherd.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.880
Wait, Shepherd?
And you trust her?

07:48.920 --> 07:51.050
At first, no,
but I confirmed it for myself

07:51.100 --> 07:53.530
when I went to go
see Cruz earlier tonight.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.530
She was nervous,
she was on edge,

07:55.580 --> 07:57.320
and she was trying
to get a read on me.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.890
Trying to manipulate me.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.280
You should've seen
her apartment.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.320
It was void of any type
of personal effects

08:03.370 --> 08:05.020
as if it was staged.

08:05.890 --> 08:08.110
Cruz has access to our files,

08:08.160 --> 08:10.590
our investigation,
she'd been using the computers.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.200
We'll have to sweep
the whole office.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.550
Years of intel is compromised.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.160
- Not everything.
- No, everything.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.730
We don't know what Cruz saw,
so we have

08:16.770 --> 08:18.120
to assume she saw everything.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.990
And whatever Cruz knows,
Tal knows.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.560
I'm sorry, look, we cannot

08:21.600 --> 08:23.260
just throw away
our entire investigation.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.586
We have to find out what she
got, we have to alert the CIA.

08:25.610 --> 08:27.910
No, no, I don't
trust anybody right now.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.180
We're gonna keep this
between us.

08:30.220 --> 08:33.010
- Until we arrest her.
- We're not arresting her.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.010
If we arrest Cruz,
she'll refuse to talk

08:35.049 --> 08:36.840
and we'll get nothing
out of her.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.450
But if we let
her continue to think

08:38.490 --> 08:39.726
that her cover is still intact,

08:39.750 --> 08:41.840
she'll keep spying for Tal.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.540
We'll be able to track her
movements, her operations.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.150
We'll know who
she's communicating with

08:46.190 --> 08:49.200
and how she's communicating
with them.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.940
Cruz is an asset to us now.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.990
We need to use her as one.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.610
Good morning.
You're at my desk.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.040
I've got some good news.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.196
There's been a development
in the Wall Street bombing.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.310
We need to question you again,
are you up for that?

09:14.350 --> 09:15.830
- Absolutely.
- Good.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.790
Daniel is waiting
for you in the SCIF room now.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.970
In the SCIF room?

09:20.010 --> 09:22.880
Must have
some pretty good intel.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.100
You said it.
I didn't.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.020
Hey, Jacquie.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.890
Keaton sent me over
for another interview.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.720
You know the drill.
SCIF rules same as at Langley.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.990
No electronics
of any kind inside.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.770
Cell lockers are over there.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.840
Anna.

10:11.450 --> 10:14.110
Please, have a seat.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.600
Maybe if you told me
the new intel,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.600
I could be of more help.
I'm sorry.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.640
I haven't been authorized
to read you in, so...

10:28.690 --> 10:32.260
Let's, uh... let's go over
your timeline again.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.170
So after you left
the conference room,

10:36.220 --> 10:38.830
where did you go?
Down the hall to accounting.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.400
And you were on your way
there when the bomb went off?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.920
Yes.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.970
Do you think that one small
act saved your life?

10:50.010 --> 10:52.410
I guess I was lucky.

10:56.110 --> 10:58.330
- How's it coming?
- Almost done.

10:58.370 --> 11:02.200
I already archived a copy of
her call log and text history.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.850
- Have you flagged anything?
- A few international calls

11:04.900 --> 11:06.770
and some incoming calls
from blocked numbers.

11:06.810 --> 11:08.730
Keep at it.

11:11.510 --> 11:14.170
You know, reliving that day
can be painful,

11:14.210 --> 11:17.170
but going over the details
can have results.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.040
I understand.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.350
- It's interesting.
- What?

11:22.390 --> 11:26.090
I've spoken with a lot
of victims in this job.

11:26.140 --> 11:29.880
I've seen people at
their absolute worst moments.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.530
You hold trauma
far better than most.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.410
I don't know about that.

11:34.450 --> 11:37.060
No, it's true.
You're strong and steady.

11:37.100 --> 11:40.020
A lot of people
in your position aren't.

11:40.060 --> 11:42.020
I guess after seeing
your parents killed

11:42.070 --> 11:45.160
in front of you
at five years old...

11:45.200 --> 11:47.370
nothing really shocks you.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.900
Hm.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.790
Kate. Anything?

12:15.840 --> 12:18.230
Not yet, but Bragg
is still tailing her.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.190
If Cruz calls anyone,
we'll be able to hear

12:20.230 --> 12:22.500
everything on the clone phone.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.710
Hey, it's me.
Cruz is making a call.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.060
We're on it.

13:14.550 --> 13:16.250
It's Cruz.

13:16.290 --> 13:17.550
What?

13:23.910 --> 13:25.390
Anna, what's up?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.300
Hey, Will.
You have a minute?

13:27.340 --> 13:30.000
It's about the other night.
Sure.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.546
I followed up on the PO box
of Nemec's.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.960
It's linked to an address
in West Virginia.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.480
8974 Kinsey Road.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.400
The property's been foreclosed
for years,

13:38.440 --> 13:41.270
but maybe Nemec could've been
using it.

13:41.310 --> 13:44.320
This could be the lead on Tal
we've been looking for.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.020
Okay, well maybe
I can have a team

13:46.060 --> 13:47.800
go out there and check it out.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.980
You could, but look,

13:50.020 --> 13:51.850
this might turn out
to be nothing.

13:51.890 --> 13:55.890
I was thinking you and I could
take a trip up there first.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.330
See for ourselves
if anything's out there.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.600
- You mean, just you and I?
- Yeah.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.600
What do you say?

14:04.950 --> 14:07.650
I'll drive.

14:10.910 --> 14:12.430
When do we leave?

14:14.170 --> 14:16.920
Will, you can't do this.
You can't go on a recon

14:16.960 --> 14:18.636
alone with a Tal operative.
I back out now,

14:18.660 --> 14:20.050
she'll suspect I'm on to her.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.570
You could think of an excuse
to get out of this.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.880
You want to go with her.
Why?

14:25.920 --> 14:28.490
Because you think
you can flip her?

14:31.150 --> 14:32.800
Is she right, Will?

14:33.930 --> 14:35.280
Yes.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.070
I know it's unlikely.
Unlikely? Are you kidding?

14:39.110 --> 14:40.460
But what if it works?

14:40.500 --> 14:42.940
Imagine the intelligence
we'll have on Tal.

14:42.990 --> 14:44.510
We could end him.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.770
What if you can't flip her?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.950
I've been waiting for evidence
to confirm this,

14:49.990 --> 14:54.080
but I think I know how Cruz
might be connected to Tal.

14:54.130 --> 14:56.780
She was adopted
from an orphanage in Havana,

14:56.820 --> 14:58.830
and at the same time,
that orphanage received

14:58.870 --> 15:00.740
a cash transfer
from a Russian bank

15:00.790 --> 15:03.180
that we've recently linked
to Tal.

15:05.050 --> 15:07.100
So you think Cruz's adoption
is connected to Tal.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.230
I don't think that she was
coerced into this life.

15:10.270 --> 15:13.450
I think it is possible that Tal
has groomed her for this

15:13.490 --> 15:16.930
since she was a little girl,
and if so,

15:16.980 --> 15:20.200
that kind of loyalty,
that personal history,

15:20.240 --> 15:23.500
it doesn't break easily.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.990
Money, ideology, coercion, ego.

15:28.030 --> 15:29.770
That's what motivates
people to spy.

15:29.810 --> 15:31.470
Cruz is no different.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.510
I'm gonna tear down that cover
that's she's built for herself

15:34.560 --> 15:36.170
and find out exactly
what drives her,

15:36.210 --> 15:40.260
and then I'm gonna use that
to turn her against Tal.

15:48.050 --> 15:49.970
- Yes?
- We need to talk.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.400
Location B.
15 minutes.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.770
What's wrong?

16:15.990 --> 16:19.470
Your source at the
Iranian Embassy's been made.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.560
- Shadi?
- We caught operatives

16:21.610 --> 16:22.886
from
the Ministry of Intelligence

16:22.910 --> 16:24.560
following her on surveillance.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.830
We think the target
of her operation,

16:26.870 --> 16:28.700
Hamid Farzan, was the one
who discovered her.

16:28.740 --> 16:31.960
- Let's get her out.
- Absolutely not.

16:32.010 --> 16:33.986
Kellerman wants you on
the next flight back to Dulles.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.376
I have orders to drive you
there myself.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.360
- They'll kill her.
- And they'll kill you

16:37.400 --> 16:39.620
if you try to help.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.890
- No, I can't leave her.
- No.

16:43.930 --> 16:45.760
This is not a choice, okay?
We need to go.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.550
No, no! I will get to her
before they do!

16:48.590 --> 16:50.590
You are asking her

16:50.630 --> 16:53.590
to betray her friends,
her family,

16:53.640 --> 16:57.860
to become a traitor
to her own country.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.600
You don't have time.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.120
You're gonna risk your life
for someone,

17:02.170 --> 17:04.260
and you don't even know
if it's gonna work.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.300
She'll go.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.410
Heads up.
There's Cruz right now.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.940
Hey, Keaton,
we got eyes on Cruz.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.120
She's headed your way.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.260
Will. Will.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.260
Please don't do this.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.960
Please... because once you get
in that car,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.140
there's no turning back.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.270
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to catch Tal.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.230
You know that.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.630
Hey.
Hey.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.590
So you ready to go?

18:15.630 --> 18:17.850
Yep, let's do it.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.180
Shadi. We have to leave now.
You've been made.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.220
- What? How?
- There's no time to explain.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.050
We have to go.
What about my family?

18:43.090 --> 18:45.310
Shadi, now.
They're coming.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.760
Let go of me.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.200
Shadi.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.306
There's a passport and money
in the glove compartment.

19:48.330 --> 19:49.990
Get to Hamburg
and you'll be safe.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.470
I don't know if I can do this.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.430
- You have to.
- What's gonna happen to Hamid?

19:53.470 --> 19:55.820
It's not your concern.
They will kill you if you stay.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.260
Go.
Thank you.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.470
Be well.

20:07.220 --> 20:09.440
You ever been out here before?

20:09.490 --> 20:11.490
To West Virginia?
Just for work. You?

20:11.530 --> 20:13.270
Once or twice.

20:30.550 --> 20:34.070
Bragg. 8974 Kinsey Road
looks clear.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.340
I just swept the inside
and checked the perimeter.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.276
All right, good to hear,
but you better pull back.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.910
Keaton and Cruz are
about five miles away.

20:40.950 --> 20:43.000
Copy that.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.480
I need to stop for gas.

20:58.930 --> 21:01.280
- How much further?
- Not far.

21:02.630 --> 21:04.580
Let me ask you a question.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.800
Who else do you talk to?

21:06.850 --> 21:08.460
About what?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.760
The bombings, kidnapping.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.850
Who do you share
that stuff with?

21:12.900 --> 21:15.070
I don't talk
to anyone about that.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.160
Not even your friends
or your family?

21:17.200 --> 21:20.900
There's a therapist
that the agency set me up with.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.690
And you've helped so much.

21:23.730 --> 21:27.740
But, honestly, most of
my friends died in the bombing.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.610
And my family's been gone
for years.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.180
I'm sorry.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.310
How old were you when they died?

21:34.350 --> 21:35.440
Young.

21:42.140 --> 21:44.280
I'm the same, actually.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.370
I never really had many friends
growing up, not even family.

21:47.410 --> 21:51.060
Really? Well, I wouldn't
have guessed it.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.110
We're a lot more alike
than you think.

21:54.150 --> 21:56.030
What happened to your family?

21:56.070 --> 22:00.640
Never knew my father,
my mother died when I was two.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.990
Who raised you?

22:02.030 --> 22:04.380
The State of Pennsylvania.

22:04.430 --> 22:06.430
Yeah, I was brought up
in the foster care system,

22:06.470 --> 22:09.950
bounced from house to house.
I've always been alone.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.350
Till I meant Laine.

22:18.830 --> 22:22.230
Her parents took me in like
I was one of their own.

22:24.530 --> 22:26.166
Actually, it was the first time
I felt like

22:26.190 --> 22:28.190
I belonged somewhere.

22:29.490 --> 22:32.190
I have someone in my life
like that.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.760
Yeah, who?

22:34.800 --> 22:37.110
- My Tio.
- Your uncle?

22:37.150 --> 22:39.640
He's not really my uncle.
I just call him that.

22:39.680 --> 22:42.460
- Why's that?
- He and his wife adopted me

22:42.510 --> 22:43.990
when I was ten.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.120
She got sick and passed away
soon after.

22:47.160 --> 22:51.340
But he never gave up on me.

22:51.390 --> 22:55.480
You know, I never thought
I'd find a home either.

22:55.520 --> 23:00.000
Then Tio brought me here
and changed my life.

23:00.050 --> 23:03.620
And he still does to this day.

23:15.930 --> 23:17.890
They're on the move.
Let's go.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.130
Pretty secluded out here.

23:35.170 --> 23:37.560
Yeah, kind of creepy.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.960
Glad you came with me.

23:45.570 --> 23:47.010
You just past it.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.750
No, it's 9874 Kinsey Road.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.710
You said it was 8974.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.400
Ah, that's my bad.

23:53.450 --> 23:55.490
Should be just a little further.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.060
- Damn.
- What?

24:01.110 --> 24:03.150
Cruz just drove
by the destination.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.980
- Well, where is she going?
- I don't know.

24:06.030 --> 24:07.940
Something's not right.

24:11.290 --> 24:12.640
Hey, Kate. It's Bragg.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.380
Cruz just drove
by the destination.

24:14.430 --> 24:17.560
I can track Keaton's GPS
from his cell.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.130
Where is she taking him?

24:31.960 --> 24:34.270
- We're here.
- This is it?

24:34.310 --> 24:36.670
I need to see what's up there.

24:42.370 --> 24:43.890
You know, I think you were right

24:43.930 --> 24:45.670
about Nemec using this property.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.280
Why do you say that?

24:47.330 --> 24:50.240
Before he committed suicide,
he talked to Daniel.

24:51.070 --> 24:52.940
Nemec flipped?

24:52.990 --> 24:55.860
What did he say?
Not much, unfortunately.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.470
He said he had some information
about the Wall Street bombings,

24:58.510 --> 25:00.340
but he didn't offer a lot
of specifics.

25:00.380 --> 25:04.040
But he did say something
about a place... Havana?

25:05.690 --> 25:07.780
He said it was at the center
of the highest levels

25:07.830 --> 25:10.260
of Tal's U.S. operations.

25:10.310 --> 25:13.480
That mean anything to you?

25:13.530 --> 25:15.400
No, not at all.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.490
Yeah, no worries.
We'll figure it out.

25:17.530 --> 25:19.530
Let's go.

25:52.220 --> 25:54.350
Where the hell did they go?

26:03.010 --> 26:04.840
I have a question.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.620
After all that Nemec did,

26:06.670 --> 26:08.630
why would you trust
anything he said?

26:08.670 --> 26:10.646
Well, you can never really
tell if he's lying or not.

26:10.670 --> 26:14.680
But we offered him a deal...
A good deal actually.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.850
And, uh...

26:16.900 --> 26:18.200
What?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.680
And it was something
about the way

26:19.720 --> 26:21.250
that he was near the end,

26:21.290 --> 26:26.560
defeated like he knew his fate
and he had just given up.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.130
I believe him.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.170
What's the new intel
you have on Tal?

26:31.210 --> 26:33.700
Can you tell me?
Nah, I can't do that.

26:33.740 --> 26:35.960
Come on, we're in the middle
of the woods.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.440
Nobody will hear a thing.
I will.

26:41.010 --> 26:45.230
Answer me this, are we any
closer to finding Tal?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.750
I feel closer to Tal
than I ever have before.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.230
Just think about it.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.240
What's that?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.330
How proud Laine would be.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.910
Everything okay?

27:57.300 --> 28:01.090
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- Any problems?

28:01.130 --> 28:02.780
No. You know, uh,

28:02.830 --> 28:06.090
you were asking about
that new intel we had on Tal.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.440
Yes?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.970
We were following one
of his colleagues.

28:10.010 --> 28:12.010
Old partner
from back in the day.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.710
He went dark years ago, and
we finally tracked him down.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.970
- Sounds promising.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.710
It is if he can give us
the inside view

28:19.760 --> 28:22.850
into Tal's network, he could
be incredibly valuable.

28:23.810 --> 28:26.810
Do you think he'll make
a deal like Nemec did?

28:27.810 --> 28:30.460
He can walk away and start over.

28:30.510 --> 28:35.510
New identity, new job.
Second chance at life.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.820
I don't believe
in second chances.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.650
Isn't that what
your Tio gave you?

28:40.690 --> 28:43.560
He gave me much more than that.

28:44.870 --> 28:47.570
Why do I get the feeling
you're testing me?

28:47.610 --> 28:49.570
We're just talking.

28:54.790 --> 28:56.790
- What are you doing?
- Did you hear that?

28:56.840 --> 28:59.140
- I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

28:59.190 --> 29:01.490
Maybe you should walk
ahead of me.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.760
- Why?
- You're the one with the gun.

29:27.690 --> 29:30.350
We can't hold off.

29:30.390 --> 29:31.870
His life is in danger.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
Keaton can make
his own decisions.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.140
Not safe ones
and not when it comes

29:36.180 --> 29:37.880
to Tal and you know that.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.680
At this point, taking risks
is the only way

29:39.710 --> 29:42.010
Keaton's gonna get out alive.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.940
Have you lost sight
of the fact that Keaton is

29:43.970 --> 29:46.890
the only reason you're able
to see your daughter?

29:46.930 --> 29:49.720
If you have any hope
of seeing her again,

29:49.760 --> 29:51.720
you better pray
he comes back safe.

30:07.690 --> 30:10.560
I know you extracted Shadi,
despite your orders not to.

30:10.610 --> 30:12.570
I'll pay whatever consequences

30:12.610 --> 30:14.050
the Agency deems necessary.

30:14.090 --> 30:16.610
And you'd do it again,
wouldn't you?

30:16.660 --> 30:18.620
In a heartbeat.

30:18.660 --> 30:20.310
That's what I thought.

30:24.710 --> 30:26.880
Open it.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.850
Eight hours ago contract killers

30:35.890 --> 30:38.850
tracked down Shadi
and shot her to death.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.120
I'm sorry, Erica.

31:00.050 --> 31:03.790
Guard, I need to speak
with Agent Ryan.

31:03.830 --> 31:05.710
It's urgent.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.230
This is it?

31:08.270 --> 31:12.360
Good thing we didn't drag
the whole team out here.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.930
Yeah, let's take a look.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.910
You brought me here
so she could ask

31:32.950 --> 31:35.130
about an asset that was killed
ten years ago?

31:35.170 --> 31:37.130
No, I brought you here
because my boss's life

31:37.170 --> 31:40.350
is in danger and she thinks
that you can help.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.350
So listen to her.

31:58.190 --> 32:02.200
In Prague,
you withheld something from me.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.370
I felt it then,
but I know it now.

32:06.200 --> 32:10.420
Shadi had a passport, cash,
and an exit strategy.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.950
She was safe.

32:14.470 --> 32:17.820
How did they track her down?

32:17.860 --> 32:20.080
Shadi never crossed the border.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.350
She never even made it
out of the city.

32:22.390 --> 32:27.740
We found her body a few blocks
away from where you left her.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.360
- What happened?
- She went to see him.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.880
Hamid. The State Official
she was spying on.

32:35.930 --> 32:37.206
We think
they were waiting for her

32:37.230 --> 32:39.540
there and then they killed her.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.630
And for years I have asked
myself why she went back.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.070
I... I can't explain it.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.770
I can.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.260
Guess we should start looking.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.780
Yeah, let's do it.

33:23.150 --> 33:25.930
Kate, I know you know
my coordinates,

33:25.980 --> 33:27.930
but you need to stand down.

33:27.980 --> 33:29.940
I know how to turn Cruz.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.590
- Shepherd?
- Listen to me.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.070
You have to tell her
who she is to you.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.730
There's a bigger reason

33:37.770 --> 33:39.876
that you've wanted to turn her
Keaton and you know it.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.470
Since the bombing, she's not
just someone that you saved

33:42.510 --> 33:46.520
from Tal, but she's someone
that has reminded you of Laine.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.130
You need to tell her that.
Why?

33:49.170 --> 33:51.610
Because any asset that's
effective enough to get under

33:51.650 --> 33:54.400
your skin had to have left
herself vulnerable too.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.010
Keaton, you are under her skin.

33:56.050 --> 33:57.490
This is working both ways.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.140
Use that.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.770
Drop the gun, Keaton.

34:19.810 --> 34:21.679
Now!

34:21.730 --> 34:23.949
Drop it!
Okay, all right, hey.

34:23.989 --> 34:27.300
You got it.
I'll drop the gun.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.170
I'll drop it.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.870
Sit down in that chair.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.570
You know you're on your own,
right?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.440
Nobody's coming for you.

34:42.489 --> 34:44.050
Quiet!

34:46.540 --> 34:50.500
You're just as disposable
to Tal as I am.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.295
He knows you've been made,
how come he's not here

34:52.320 --> 34:53.929
to protect you?
Where is he?

34:53.980 --> 34:56.889
He should have pulled you out
by now.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.160
Anna, I can protect you.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.460
How?

35:02.510 --> 35:04.470
By sending me to live
in WITSEC in North Dakota?

35:04.510 --> 35:06.250
No, thanks.
Better than spending

35:06.290 --> 35:08.860
the rest of your life
in a cell or dead.

35:08.910 --> 35:11.080
This is pointless!

35:11.130 --> 35:13.340
I could never trust you.

35:13.390 --> 35:16.090
Yes, you can.

35:16.130 --> 35:17.910
Yes, you can.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.090
I'll keep my word.

35:24.310 --> 35:26.970
Not everything I said was a lie.

35:29.450 --> 35:32.060
I know that.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.450
Not everything I said
was a lie, either.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.550
The truth is, is that

35:40.590 --> 35:44.110
you've always reminded
me of Laine.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.210
From the moment I saw you.

35:50.250 --> 35:53.210
I was just drawn to you.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.210
I believed that you wanted
to make a difference

35:55.260 --> 35:57.260
in the world same way Laine did.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.000
It's not your fault
that Tal manipulated you

36:01.040 --> 36:03.390
from a young age.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.750
You wanted to be a part of
something bigger than yourself.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.920
And you still can.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.670
So this is what I'm gonna do.

36:14.710 --> 36:17.320
I'm gonna take you
to a safe house right now.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.580
You'll be able to start
a whole new life there.

36:19.630 --> 36:23.150
But first I need you
to put that gun down.

36:30.070 --> 36:32.080
That's it.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.300
That's it.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.530
You're okay.
Stay with me.

36:50.490 --> 36:51.880
Chigorin.

37:40.930 --> 37:42.450
Drop your gun.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.410
Drop your gun.

37:49.370 --> 37:51.760
Don't do it.
Put it down.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.990
You were right, Will.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.910
She planted enough evidence
in here

38:06.950 --> 38:08.926
to send us down a rabbit hole
for the next year at least.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.700
- The sniper?
- Ray Fontaine.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.530
Former military,
known associate of Tal.

38:20.310 --> 38:22.930
We caught a mole, Will.

38:22.970 --> 38:24.840
Still doesn't feel like a win.

38:24.880 --> 38:28.630
Because she wasn't
who you thought she was?

38:28.670 --> 38:31.670
No, because I think I could
have turned her.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.440
- Kate.
- Hi.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.050
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

38:56.090 --> 38:58.920
I just wanted to apologize
for earlier.

38:58.960 --> 39:03.310
Um, sometimes I can get
bullheaded, uh...

39:03.360 --> 39:05.530
I just wanted you to know,
at the end of the day,

39:05.580 --> 39:08.410
it's because I'm being
protective.

39:08.450 --> 39:09.800
I know.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.060
Still, I had no right

39:12.100 --> 39:15.370
to question how you run
an operation.

39:15.410 --> 39:17.550
No, no. It's important
to me for you

39:17.590 --> 39:20.330
to always give me
your honest opinion.

39:20.370 --> 39:22.160
Just maybe not so many times.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.810
Deal.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.600
Good.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.900
- Okay.
- All right.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.520
- Have a good night.
- Good night, Kate.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.320
I'm sorry it didn't work out

39:51.360 --> 39:53.100
the way you hoped, Agent Keaton.

39:53.150 --> 39:55.930
Yeah, I am too.

39:55.970 --> 39:57.890
But Cruz's cell phone
is still connected

39:57.930 --> 39:59.500
to Tal's mesh network.

39:59.540 --> 40:01.280
If we can crack it,

40:01.330 --> 40:04.070
it could be the biggest break
yet in this investigation.

40:07.030 --> 40:10.770
How did you know that Cruz
reminded me of Laine?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.910
I saw it, I think.

40:21.090 --> 40:25.610
I learned a valuable lesson
running assets for the CIA.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.700
They're always more effective
when they can tap

40:27.750 --> 40:30.310
into a target's weakness.

40:30.360 --> 40:33.400
Cruz knew that yours was Laine,
and she exploited it,

40:33.450 --> 40:36.280
but what Tal didn't count on

40:36.320 --> 40:40.850
was how weak and susceptible
her loss left her.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.850
We're all only human, Keaton.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.250
She did mention something.
It was a name.

40:51.290 --> 40:52.860
Chigorin.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.510
Does that mean anything to you?

40:55.560 --> 40:57.300
No.

41:02.690 --> 41:04.780
Good night, Shepherd.

41:05.870 --> 41:07.870
Good night, Agent Keaton.

41:43.780 --> 41:47.000
Are you proud, Agent Keaton?

41:47.040 --> 41:48.610
Tal.

41:48.650 --> 41:50.180
You saw Anna for what she was

41:50.220 --> 41:53.180
but not before she gave me
what I wanted.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.490
You had somebody on the inside.

41:56.530 --> 41:58.400
It ended tonight.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.450
What makes you think
she's the only one?
