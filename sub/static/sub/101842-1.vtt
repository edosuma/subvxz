00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
d

00:20.000 --> 00:20.755
[Alice]  Oh, God,

00:20.795 --> 00:21.980
there must be a better way.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.719
There must be a better way

00:23.759 --> 00:24.980
to describe things,

00:25.020 --> 00:26.639
to arrange words

00:26.679 --> 00:27.980
in a new way,

00:28.020 --> 00:29.980
to use words

00:30.020 --> 00:31.871
to take you to a place

00:31.911 --> 00:32.980
beyond words.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.980
There must be.

00:35.020 --> 00:35.960
[Karen]  I'm so glad

00:36.000 --> 00:36.386
that we could finally

00:36.426 --> 00:36.980
sit down together.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.360
I know we haven't had

00:38.400 --> 00:39.980
a chance to do that since

00:40.020 --> 00:40.894
-Sonia retired.

00:40.934 --> 00:41.980
-[Alice]  Mmm-hmm.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.980
[Karen] I know that she is...

00:44.020 --> 00:44.980
She is very sad to go,

00:45.020 --> 00:46.672
-understandably, but, um...

00:46.712 --> 00:46.980
-Mmm.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.640
-It's just such a shame.

00:48.680 --> 00:48.980
-Mmm.

00:49.020 --> 00:51.450
-Retiring at, what, 70?

00:51.490 --> 00:51.980
-Mmm.

00:52.020 --> 00:52.818
-Why?

00:52.858 --> 00:53.980
-Well--

00:54.020 --> 00:55.756
I mean, it doesn't make

00:55.796 --> 00:56.980
any sense to me.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.650
Well, I know that...

00:58.690 --> 00:58.829
That her husband

00:58.869 --> 00:59.980
obviously hasn't been--

01:00.020 --> 01:01.522
-The husband is ill.

01:01.562 --> 01:01.980
-Yeah.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.980
The children are needy.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.627
-The children are 40...

01:04.667 --> 01:04.980
-Mmm.

01:05.020 --> 01:07.021
...but are more needy

01:07.061 --> 01:07.980
than ever.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.980
So that's confusing.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.583
And how long have you been

01:12.623 --> 01:13.980
at the agency?

01:14.020 --> 01:15.103
I know we've spoken

01:15.143 --> 01:15.980
on the phone...

01:16.020 --> 01:16.980
Mmm.

01:17.020 --> 01:18.520
...for a couple of years.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.980
Well, I've been...

01:22.020 --> 01:24.016
I think it's been eight years

01:24.056 --> 01:25.980
I've been at the agency now,

01:26.020 --> 01:27.799
and I've been assisting Sonia

01:27.839 --> 01:28.980
for the last seven.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.459
So, actually, I... I know it

01:30.499 --> 01:31.980
may seem that I'm... I'm new,

01:32.020 --> 01:32.725
-but I've been...

01:32.765 --> 01:33.265
-Gosh.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.980
...working on your account

01:35.020 --> 01:36.980
and working on your sales,

01:37.020 --> 01:38.275
and I should say that

01:38.315 --> 01:39.980
there is a lot of excitement

01:40.020 --> 01:41.483
at the agency, uh,

01:41.523 --> 01:43.980
regarding your new manuscript,

01:44.020 --> 01:45.065
and... and without wanting

01:45.105 --> 01:45.980
to... to pry too much,

01:46.020 --> 01:47.662
is there... is there anything

01:47.702 --> 01:48.980
you might be able to...

01:49.020 --> 01:50.980
to share with us?

01:51.020 --> 01:51.647
Not really.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.007
Not at this point, no.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.980
I'm sorry to be so blunt,

01:56.020 --> 01:58.980
but, um, Sonia never invaded

01:59.020 --> 02:00.980
my process in any way,

02:01.020 --> 02:01.861
and she always

02:01.901 --> 02:02.980
gave me free rein.

02:03.020 --> 02:05.287
She gave me the dignity

02:05.327 --> 02:07.980
and... and the, uh, respect

02:08.020 --> 02:09.980
of complete autonomy.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.980
[clears throat]

02:12.020 --> 02:12.803
Well, um,

02:12.843 --> 02:14.980
everyone's very excited.

02:15.020 --> 02:15.446
-Um...

02:15.486 --> 02:16.000
-Great.

02:17.000 --> 02:17.947
What do you like

02:17.987 --> 02:18.980
about my writing?

02:19.020 --> 02:20.942
I mean, what... what pulls you

02:20.982 --> 02:22.000
to the material?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, um...

02:27.000 --> 02:28.980
I have to say, I...

02:29.020 --> 02:29.722
The first book

02:29.762 --> 02:30.980
of yours that I read was

02:31.020 --> 02:32.980
You Always, You Never.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.571
-Mmm.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.980
-And I was--

02:35.020 --> 02:36.259
Did you ever read

02:36.299 --> 02:37.980
A Function of the Body?

02:38.020 --> 02:39.218
Was that one of the ones

02:39.258 --> 02:39.980
that you liked?

02:40.020 --> 02:41.118
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

02:41.158 --> 02:41.980
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

02:42.020 --> 02:42.902
That was a much,

02:42.942 --> 02:43.980
much better book...

02:44.020 --> 02:44.680
-Uh-huh.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.980
-Quite frankly.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.680
You Always, You Never,

02:47.720 --> 02:50.000
yes, it has a residual impact.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.980
Uh, it won the Pulitzer,

02:52.020 --> 02:54.008
but it's a... it's a completely

02:54.048 --> 02:54.980
different thing

02:55.020 --> 02:55.612
than the...

02:55.652 --> 02:56.980
than the Footling Prize.

02:57.020 --> 02:58.980
Mmm...

02:59.020 --> 02:59.861
Oh, yes, I... I meant

02:59.901 --> 03:00.980
to bring that up, actually.

03:01.020 --> 03:01.375
They are...

03:01.415 --> 03:01.980
[inhales sharply]

03:02.020 --> 03:03.205
They are asking for...

03:03.245 --> 03:03.980
for an answer.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.486
They're... they're...

03:05.526 --> 03:06.241
obviously, they're...

03:06.281 --> 03:06.980
they're hoping

03:07.020 --> 03:07.607
that you'll be able to make it,

03:07.647 --> 03:07.980
and... and it is...

03:08.020 --> 03:09.795
Do you realize that they

03:09.835 --> 03:11.980
don't give the Footling Prize

03:12.020 --> 03:13.980
in fiction every year?

03:14.020 --> 03:16.189
It's... it's something

03:16.229 --> 03:16.755
that other writers

03:16.795 --> 03:17.980
confer on writers.

03:18.020 --> 03:18.980
Mmm-hmm. Well--

03:19.020 --> 03:20.789
I'm so proud,

03:20.829 --> 03:23.980
but I, I, I just, uh...

03:24.020 --> 03:25.980
I can't attend.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.000
I can't attend.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's killing me.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.980
Um, but...

03:33.020 --> 03:33.780
-Well--

03:33.820 --> 03:37.000
-I can't fly, you see, so...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.597
-I can't fly. [sighs]

03:39.637 --> 03:39.980
-Do--

03:40.020 --> 03:40.543
And along

03:40.583 --> 03:41.980
with the other things--

03:42.020 --> 03:43.980
Would you consider...

03:44.020 --> 03:44.545
I mean,

03:44.585 --> 03:45.980
there may be a way

03:46.020 --> 03:47.027
for you to get to the UK

03:47.067 --> 03:47.980
without having to fly.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.799
I mean, there's... there's...

03:49.839 --> 03:50.980
there's a crossing.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.168
There's... there's a ship,

03:52.208 --> 03:52.980
the  Queen Mary 2,

03:53.020 --> 03:53.940
that... that goes from

03:53.980 --> 03:54.980
New York to Southampton.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.257
I... I happen to know

03:56.297 --> 03:56.309
the director

03:56.309 --> 03:57.449
of the Cunard Line,

03:58.000 --> 03:58.647
and, you know,

03:58.687 --> 03:59.980
they have regular crossings,

04:00.020 --> 04:00.722
um, between...

04:00.762 --> 04:01.980
Transatlantic crossings,

04:02.020 --> 04:03.137
and I'm sure...

04:03.177 --> 04:04.000
[hesitates]

04:05.000 --> 04:05.286
I'm sure

04:05.326 --> 04:05.980
if I spoke to him,

04:06.020 --> 04:07.080
they'd be willing to... to...

04:07.120 --> 04:08.560
to give you a state room

04:09.000 --> 04:09.589
and, and whatever

04:09.629 --> 04:09.980
you needed.

04:10.020 --> 04:10.825
I mean, in...

04:10.865 --> 04:12.000
in exchange for...

04:13.000 --> 04:13.389
perhaps if you did

04:13.429 --> 04:13.980
a little talk on the boat,

04:14.020 --> 04:15.475
-um, uh, then...

04:15.515 --> 04:17.980
-Oh, well, I don't think...

04:18.020 --> 04:18.420
Then something

04:18.460 --> 04:18.980
could be arranged.

04:19.020 --> 04:19.955
And I... just...

04:19.995 --> 04:20.980
just hear me out.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.980
I think...

04:23.020 --> 04:24.195
Yes, I think that might

04:24.235 --> 04:24.980
be the solution

04:25.020 --> 04:26.437
to be able to get you there,

04:26.477 --> 04:27.980
because, obviously, this prize

04:28.020 --> 04:29.219
means so much to you,

04:29.259 --> 04:29.980
as it should,

04:30.020 --> 04:30.571
and I know

04:30.611 --> 04:31.980
that they'd be thrilled,

04:32.020 --> 04:33.273
uh, if you were able

04:33.313 --> 04:33.980
to make it.

04:34.020 --> 04:34.946
And... and it really is...

04:34.986 --> 04:35.980
It's a lovely way to travel.

04:36.020 --> 04:36.854
It's a...

04:36.894 --> 04:38.980
it's a beautiful ship.

04:39.020 --> 04:39.980
Could I bring guests?

04:40.020 --> 04:41.219
-Yes, of course.

04:41.259 --> 04:41.980
-How many?

04:42.020 --> 04:44.980
d

04:45.020 --> 04:45.915
[Eddie]  Uh, and my main...

04:45.955 --> 04:46.980
my main feeling is just feeling

04:47.020 --> 04:48.299
like I'm a burden on you,

04:48.339 --> 04:48.980
and... and...

04:49.020 --> 04:51.025
just, like, shoving myself

04:51.065 --> 04:52.980
in here when, you know...

04:53.020 --> 04:53.986
And I appreciate it.

04:54.026 --> 04:54.980
Mika appreciates it.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.168
-You know, I invited you--

04:56.208 --> 04:56.980
-And I just want--

04:57.020 --> 04:58.340
May I just remind you?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.231
-I invited you.

05:00.271 --> 05:00.980
-Mmm-hmm.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.980
I'm your mom. I'm your family.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.617
What's that

05:04.657 --> 05:06.980
for if not to...

05:07.020 --> 05:07.617
[baby crying,

05:07.657 --> 05:08.980
woman chatters indistinctly]

05:09.020 --> 05:10.111
I... I still

05:10.151 --> 05:11.980
don't understand it.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.880
What... How could... You...

05:13.920 --> 05:15.980
You did this company together.

05:16.020 --> 05:16.543
-Mmm-hmm.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.980
-And I don't understand

05:18.020 --> 05:19.334
-how he cut you out...

05:19.374 --> 05:21.000
-I think he thinks that I--

05:22.000 --> 05:22.655
-...why he would do that.

05:22.695 --> 05:22.980
-Well, he...

05:23.020 --> 05:24.344
He used the program

05:24.384 --> 05:25.980
that I had developed...

05:26.020 --> 05:27.520
or I... It was my idea.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.980
He actually did the...

05:29.020 --> 05:30.580
He was the engineer on it.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.980
I don't know, honey.

05:32.020 --> 05:32.980
I really don't know.

05:33.020 --> 05:33.980
I'm clueless, actually,

05:34.020 --> 05:34.815
about what you're

05:34.855 --> 05:36.295
going through with this.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.928
That a friend should

05:37.968 --> 05:39.288
do this to you is, um,

05:40.000 --> 05:40.980
kind of outrageous.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.360
-It's shock... It's...

05:42.400 --> 05:43.980
-It makes me feel violent.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.395
-[chuckles] Mom.

05:45.435 --> 05:46.980
-Mmm-hmm. It does.

05:47.020 --> 05:47.711
-Easily.

05:47.751 --> 05:48.980
-[baby crying]

05:49.020 --> 05:50.184
Don't let that

05:50.224 --> 05:52.000
motherfucker near me.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.980
Why wouldn't you

05:54.020 --> 05:54.980
go on this trip?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.980
I mean, it sounds fascinating.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.885
Well, Cheryl needs more prep

05:58.925 --> 06:00.980
time before her parole hearing.

06:01.020 --> 06:01.803
Mom, the hearing

06:01.843 --> 06:03.223
is six months from now.

06:05.000 --> 06:05.980
Roberta's going, right?

06:06.020 --> 06:07.792
Yes, Roberta's

06:07.832 --> 06:09.980
definitely going.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.328
And you haven't heard

06:11.368 --> 06:13.000
from Alice since Dad died.

06:14.000 --> 06:14.980
And when did you last see,

06:15.020 --> 06:15.980
you know, her and Roberta?

06:16.020 --> 06:17.518
Oh, wow, I don't think

06:17.558 --> 06:18.980
we've seen each other

06:19.020 --> 06:20.980
since, um... whoa...

06:21.020 --> 06:22.770
since we all got together

06:22.810 --> 06:23.980
in San Francisco.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.980
That was, like, when was that?

06:26.020 --> 06:28.229
Oh, that was...that was

06:28.269 --> 06:30.000
over 30 years ago.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, you got to go.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.098
You have... I think

06:37.138 --> 06:37.980
you have to go,

06:38.020 --> 06:39.010
just to find out why

06:39.050 --> 06:39.980
she's reaching out.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.986
And why you two?

06:42.026 --> 06:42.980
Why now?

06:43.020 --> 06:45.980
d

06:46.020 --> 06:46.578
-[customer]  How are you?

06:46.618 --> 06:46.980
-[Roberta]  Fine.

06:47.020 --> 06:49.074
[customer] So I am very

06:49.114 --> 06:50.980
frustrated right now.

06:51.020 --> 06:51.674
-Oh, dear.

06:51.714 --> 06:52.980
-[laughing] I know.

06:53.020 --> 06:54.184
Um, I called ahead...

06:54.224 --> 06:54.980
Are you Carol?

06:55.020 --> 06:55.985
No, I am Roberta,

06:56.025 --> 06:56.980
as you can see...

06:57.020 --> 06:57.854
-I do see it now.

06:57.894 --> 06:58.980
-If you have eyeballs.

06:59.020 --> 06:59.877
[chuckles] I do.

06:59.917 --> 07:00.980
Okay, I called ahead

07:01.020 --> 07:02.233
and spoke to someone

07:02.273 --> 07:02.980
named Carol,

07:03.020 --> 07:03.436
who perhaps was your

07:03.476 --> 07:04.916
manager... I don't know.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.401
And I don't want

07:05.441 --> 07:05.980
to get you in trouble,

07:06.020 --> 07:08.003
but she did tell me

07:08.043 --> 07:10.980
that you have a peacock blue

07:11.020 --> 07:12.980
panty and bra set.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.568
And that is what I'm here for,

07:15.608 --> 07:18.000
and all I am seeing is teal.

07:19.000 --> 07:19.980
So...

07:20.020 --> 07:21.520
Can I just point out

07:21.560 --> 07:22.980
that the difference

07:23.020 --> 07:25.121
between teal and peacock

07:25.161 --> 07:26.980
is as fine as a hair.

07:27.020 --> 07:28.017
-[both chuckle]

07:28.057 --> 07:28.980
-Maybe to you.

07:29.020 --> 07:29.922
I have a really highly

07:29.962 --> 07:30.980
developed sense of color.

07:31.020 --> 07:31.980
I'm a designer.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
There's too much

07:33.060 --> 07:33.980
yellow in this.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
Now, let me help

07:35.060 --> 07:35.980
you understand.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.183

07:37.223 --> 07:38.000

07:40.000 --> 07:40.980
d

07:41.020 --> 07:41.634
-Hey.

07:41.674 --> 07:42.669
-Clovis, remember,

07:42.709 --> 07:43.980
I am leaving today

07:44.020 --> 07:45.387
for two weeks,

07:45.427 --> 07:45.867
and I'll be back

07:45.907 --> 07:46.980
on the 16th, okay?

07:47.020 --> 07:48.460
Wait, you're going away?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.066
[laughs] Yeah, I told you

07:50.106 --> 07:50.980
all this in the email

07:51.020 --> 07:52.980
about three weeks ago.

07:53.020 --> 07:53.652
I gave you

07:53.692 --> 07:54.980
the whole itinerary.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.046
-I didn't get your email.

07:56.086 --> 07:56.980
-I... I think you did.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.980
I didn't get an email from you.

07:59.020 --> 07:59.980
Because I sent it.

08:00.020 --> 08:00.986
Oh, okay, can you get

08:01.026 --> 08:01.980
someone to cover you?

08:02.020 --> 08:02.906
'Cause I have you

08:02.946 --> 08:03.980
five days next week.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.980
No, but I think you can

08:06.020 --> 08:07.103
because that's your

08:07.143 --> 08:07.980
job as manager.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.000
Bye-bye.

[Tyler inhales sharply]

08:17.847 --> 08:17.980
Um...

08:18.020 --> 08:19.488
They're her... like, her two

08:19.528 --> 08:21.208
oldest friends from college.

08:22.000 --> 08:22.194
-Really?

08:22.234 --> 08:22.980
-Yeah. So they've been, like,

08:23.020 --> 08:24.318
friends for, like,

08:24.358 --> 08:24.980
50 years.

08:25.020 --> 08:25.244
-Jesus.

08:25.284 --> 08:25.980
-Just been chillin'.

08:26.020 --> 08:26.955
Or... or I guess

08:26.995 --> 08:27.980
they haven't seen

08:28.020 --> 08:28.636
each other in a while...

08:28.676 --> 08:29.456
I'm not sure.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.955
I don't know what...

08:30.995 --> 08:31.980
for our generation...

08:32.020 --> 08:33.038
what friendship will look like

08:33.078 --> 08:34.698
over a long period of time.

08:35.000 --> 08:35.444
At least, I've only

08:35.484 --> 08:35.652
had friends for, like,

08:35.692 --> 08:36.952
four years at a time,

08:37.000 --> 08:37.921
and these women have been

08:37.961 --> 08:38.980
friends for, like, 50 years,

08:39.020 --> 08:39.980
so just trying to maybe

08:40.020 --> 08:40.980
study them and learn...

08:41.020 --> 08:42.119
maybe I can learn

08:42.159 --> 08:43.537
something from it, you know?

08:43.577 --> 08:44.077
[laughs]

08:46.000 --> 08:46.954
And, what, she's,

08:46.994 --> 08:47.980
like, a TV person?

08:48.020 --> 08:48.619
No, she's a writer.

08:48.659 --> 08:48.980
She's an...

08:49.020 --> 08:49.205
-Oh.

08:49.245 --> 08:50.085
-...an author.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.133
-Oh.

08:51.173 --> 08:51.980
-Do you not know this?

08:52.020 --> 08:52.512
No, you didn't tell us

08:52.552 --> 08:53.752
anything about this.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.702
What do you mean?

08:54.742 --> 08:55.980
You don't know who my aunt is?

08:56.020 --> 08:57.980
Or... You don't?

Alice Hughes,

08:59.138 --> 09:00.980
You Always, You Never.

09:01.020 --> 09:01.463
It won

09:01.503 --> 09:02.980
the Pulitzer Prize.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.276
It's been turned into a movie

09:04.316 --> 09:04.980
and a miniseries

09:05.020 --> 09:06.487
in the last, I don't know,

09:06.527 --> 09:07.980
15, 20 years or something.

09:08.020 --> 09:08.843
What... What...

09:08.883 --> 09:09.980
You haven't seen it?

09:10.020 --> 09:10.349
This was...

09:10.389 --> 09:10.980
This was years ago?

09:11.020 --> 09:12.980
Or this was recent?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.219
I'm really surprised.

09:14.259 --> 09:14.980
It's, like...

09:15.020 --> 09:16.980
Well, you should read it.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.149
It's an unbelievable book

09:18.189 --> 09:18.980
and a great movie.

09:19.020 --> 09:19.753
Can you not go?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.233
Why... why would you go?

09:22.000 --> 09:22.314
-Yeah.

09:22.354 --> 09:22.980
-Aw, thanks.

09:23.020 --> 09:23.785
No, it's not

09:23.825 --> 09:24.980
a "thanks" moment.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.485
Well, you... you...

09:26.525 --> 09:26.837
I felt so much love

09:26.877 --> 09:27.980
from you in that moment,

09:28.020 --> 09:28.980
so I had to say thanks.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.716
No, I got to go.

09:30.756 --> 09:32.980
I got to go do, um...

09:33.020 --> 09:34.027
I mean, I just got to go

09:34.067 --> 09:34.980
do my thing, you know?

09:35.020 --> 09:36.801
Take... take care of these

09:36.841 --> 09:37.980
lovely old women.

09:38.020 --> 09:38.820
She desperately wants

09:38.860 --> 09:40.600
to accept the Footling Prize,

09:41.000 --> 09:41.480
but she can't fly,

09:41.520 --> 09:41.980
so I've booked her

09:42.020 --> 09:43.566
on the  Queen Mary 2  with her

09:43.606 --> 09:44.980
two friends and her nephew.

09:45.020 --> 09:45.980
I'm not...

09:46.020 --> 09:47.561
She gets on the boat,

09:47.601 --> 09:48.980
she takes the boat,

09:49.020 --> 09:50.081
and then you take

09:50.121 --> 09:50.980
the boat, too,

09:51.020 --> 09:53.980
for what purpose, exactly?

09:54.020 --> 09:55.261
Well, for years now,

09:55.301 --> 09:56.980
she's been hinting to Sonia

09:57.020 --> 09:57.959
that she's revisiting

09:57.999 --> 09:58.980
one of her characters,

09:59.020 --> 09:59.988
and we're hoping it's Rowena

10:00.028 --> 10:01.708
from  You Always, You Never,

10:02.000 --> 10:02.364
but then again,

10:02.404 --> 10:02.980
whenever anyone mentions

10:03.020 --> 10:03.549
You Always, You Never,

10:03.589 --> 10:04.609
she slags it off.

10:05.000 --> 10:05.379
If she hated

10:05.419 --> 10:05.980
that book so much,

10:06.020 --> 10:07.010
why'd she put it out

10:07.050 --> 10:07.980
in the first place?

10:08.020 --> 10:08.557
Well, it was a long time ago,

10:08.597 --> 10:08.980
so I can understand...

10:09.020 --> 10:10.470
Know what we're gonna get?

10:10.510 --> 10:10.980
Our luck,

10:11.020 --> 10:11.461
we're gonna get a sequel

10:11.501 --> 10:11.980
to  A Function of the Body.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.063
Well, she did mention

10:13.103 --> 10:13.980
she considers that

10:14.020 --> 10:14.672
-to be a much better book.

10:14.712 --> 10:14.980
-Oh, my God.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.011
Of course she did.

10:16.051 --> 10:16.980
Here's a thought.

10:17.020 --> 10:17.798
How about a sequel

10:17.838 --> 10:18.980
to  You Always, You Never,

10:19.020 --> 10:20.131
and maybe make it better

10:20.171 --> 10:20.980
than the original?

10:21.020 --> 10:23.000
How's that for a bold idea?

10:24.000 --> 10:24.595
I completely agree,

10:24.635 --> 10:25.355
which is why

10:26.000 --> 10:26.584
I think I need to be

10:26.624 --> 10:26.980
on that ship.

10:27.020 --> 10:27.980
It's a big ask.

10:28.020 --> 10:28.634
It's not just the cost

10:28.674 --> 10:28.980
of the trip.

10:29.020 --> 10:29.894
You're gonna be

10:29.934 --> 10:30.980
out of the office.

10:31.020 --> 10:31.437
Well, I just don't see

10:31.477 --> 10:32.960
that there's any other way.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.673
All right, but if this

10:34.713 --> 10:35.980
doesn't work out,

10:36.020 --> 10:37.280
you're gonna wear it.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
[sighs] All right.

Sometimes it's a

'cause, you know,

13:55.462 --> 13:55.980
they won't get parole.

13:57.347 --> 13:58.980
and the parole board just...

14:03.264 --> 14:03.980

14:04.020 --> 14:04.980
the good fight.

14:05.687 --> 14:06.980
-[Susan] I don't know.

14:07.020 --> 14:07.461
-I think so, yeah.

14:07.501 --> 14:07.770
-[Susan] I'm trying.

14:07.810 --> 14:07.980
I'm trying.

14:08.020 --> 14:09.697
The main thing is the

14:09.737 --> 14:11.980
connection with the women...

14:12.020 --> 14:12.274
-Mmm.

14:12.314 --> 14:13.980
-[Susan] Is just such a gift.

14:14.020 --> 14:14.881
-It's everything.

14:14.921 --> 14:15.980
-[Susan] It's a gift.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.602
[Alice] What about you, Bert?

14:17.642 --> 14:19.142
What have you been up to?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.980
Oh, well...

14:22.020 --> 14:22.906
not much, really,

14:22.946 --> 14:23.980
not much. [chuckles]

14:24.020 --> 14:25.279
I don't advocate

14:25.319 --> 14:26.980
for anybody except...

14:27.020 --> 14:28.986
I advocate for women's

14:29.026 --> 14:30.980
brassieres, basically.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.660
I hope you'll look

14:45.700 --> 14:47.980
at the  Realm of the Owl,

14:48.020 --> 14:49.160
-which is her seminal work.

14:49.200 --> 14:49.980
-[Susan] Thank you.

14:50.020 --> 14:50.695
[Alice] She didn't write

14:50.735 --> 14:51.335
very much,

14:52.000 --> 14:52.980
but the work

14:53.020 --> 14:55.000
that she did write is...

14:57.000 --> 14:57.708
groundbreaking,

14:57.748 --> 14:58.980
and I think it's important

14:59.020 --> 15:02.000
that we all somehow...

15:03.000 --> 15:03.980
share the work

15:04.020 --> 15:05.533
before we go

15:05.573 --> 15:07.980
and stand at her...

15:08.020 --> 15:09.980
at her grave.

15:10.020 --> 15:10.980
[whispers] Thank you.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.980
[Alice] Um, so...

15:14.020 --> 15:15.273
speaking of writing,

15:15.313 --> 15:15.980
I'm just...

15:16.020 --> 15:16.686
I'm just not

15:16.726 --> 15:17.980
going to be available.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.236
I've got a draft of a novel

15:20.276 --> 15:21.980
I'm trying to finish.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.935
I have, uh...

15:23.975 --> 15:24.980
[sighs]

15:25.020 --> 15:26.980
This address that's, uh...

15:27.020 --> 15:28.580
You know, they don't give

15:28.620 --> 15:29.980
this prize every year.

15:30.020 --> 15:30.986
But we'll have supper

15:31.026 --> 15:31.980
together, and we'll--

15:32.020 --> 15:33.980
Good. Yes.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.609
[Alice] You can tell me

15:34.649 --> 15:34.980
all the things

15:35.020 --> 15:36.487
that I'm missing out on.

15:36.527 --> 15:37.027
[laughs]

15:38.000 --> 15:39.645
Here's to picking up

15:39.685 --> 15:40.980
the conversation

15:41.020 --> 15:41.980
where we left off.

15:42.020 --> 15:43.122
-[chuckles] You know?

15:43.162 --> 15:43.980
-[Susan] Cheers.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.980
And here's to, maybe,

15:47.020 --> 15:48.892
reconnecting the gang

15:48.932 --> 15:50.980
of three we used to be.

15:51.020 --> 15:51.980

15:52.020 --> 15:53.980
Cheers.

15:56.112 --> 15:56.980
-Thank you very much.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.098
-[Tyler] Have a good one.

15:58.138 --> 15:58.627
-[Susan] Good night.

15:58.667 --> 15:58.980
Thank you.

15:59.020 --> 15:59.758
-Good night.

15:59.798 --> 16:00.980
-Have a good night.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.086
Hey, Bert, want to go

16:04.126 --> 16:05.980

16:06.020 --> 16:07.828
No, I can't.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.656
Hey, don't freak out.

16:32.696 --> 16:34.980
This is Karen, Alice's agent.

16:35.020 --> 16:35.980
I'm actually on this ship.

16:36.020 --> 16:36.867
Can you meet me

16:36.907 --> 16:37.980
in the Verandah bar

16:38.020 --> 16:39.980
in 15 minutes?

16:40.020 --> 16:41.000
What?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Hi.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.394
-Karen?

16:44.434 --> 16:44.980
-Yeah, hi.

16:45.020 --> 16:45.785

Yeah, nice

16:47.392 --> 16:47.980
to meet you, too.

16:48.020 --> 16:48.750
Heard so much

16:48.790 --> 16:50.050
about you from Alice.

16:51.000 --> 16:51.551
-Really?

16:51.591 --> 16:51.980
-Yeah.

16:52.020 --> 16:52.980
Oh, wow. Cool.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.980
Um, would you like a drink?

16:55.020 --> 16:56.349
Um, sure, yeah.

16:56.389 --> 16:57.013
Um, what do you...

16:57.053 --> 16:57.980
What'd you have?

16:58.020 --> 16:59.980
Uh, vodka soda.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.220
[Tyler] Okay, um, so can

17:02.260 --> 17:03.980
I have a margarita?

17:04.020 --> 17:05.008
-Can you do margarita?

17:05.048 --> 17:05.980
-[barman] Yeah, sure.

17:06.020 --> 17:06.980
Oh, it's amazing.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.187
I'm... I'm a guest

17:08.227 --> 17:09.980
of a friend who's speaking,

17:10.020 --> 17:11.818
so I... I'm very lucky

17:11.858 --> 17:13.980
to get to be on this ship.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.213
-That's wonderful.

17:15.253 --> 17:16.118
-I... I wouldn't have been

17:16.158 --> 17:16.980
able to otherwise,

17:17.020 --> 17:18.635
-and it's magnificent.

17:18.675 --> 17:19.980
-[man] Yeah, yeah.

17:20.020 --> 17:20.275
You know,

17:20.315 --> 17:20.980
I was only in the pub.

17:21.020 --> 17:21.638
They have a pub

17:21.678 --> 17:21.980
on here.

17:22.020 --> 17:22.985
I was in the pub,

17:23.025 --> 17:23.980
and I actually...

17:24.020 --> 17:24.699
I actually

17:24.739 --> 17:25.980
managed to sell...

17:26.020 --> 17:26.693
You shouldn't...

17:26.733 --> 17:27.980
you're not supposed to do it,

17:28.020 --> 17:28.951
but I actually

17:28.991 --> 17:29.980
managed to sell

17:30.020 --> 17:32.985
a big quantity of my shoelaces

17:33.025 --> 17:34.980
to a guy in the pub.

17:35.020 --> 17:35.571
-Hmm.

17:35.611 --> 17:36.980
-Yeah, yeah.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.095
Turned a profit

17:38.135 --> 17:38.980
on the ship.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.623
I, I have already, yeah.

17:40.663 --> 17:41.980
I... I've done that.

17:42.020 --> 17:42.557
-I know.

17:42.597 --> 17:42.980
-Uh...

17:43.020 --> 17:44.671
We're... we're turning over

17:44.711 --> 17:45.980
a lot of money in it.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.880
How, how, how much money

17:47.920 --> 17:48.980
would that be?

17:49.020 --> 17:50.540
-Do you want to know?

17:50.580 --> 17:50.980
-Yeah.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.276
-I've just met you. I mean...

17:52.316 --> 17:52.980
-I want to know.

17:53.020 --> 17:54.090
[Karen]  Let me start

17:54.130 --> 17:54.980
at the beginning.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.841
Um, Alice has a manuscript

17:56.881 --> 17:58.980
that's due, like, really soon,

17:59.020 --> 18:00.677
and, uh, everyone at the agency

18:00.717 --> 18:01.980
is getting a bit nervous

18:02.020 --> 18:02.791
and wondering whether

18:02.831 --> 18:03.980
it's gonna be finished on time,

18:04.020 --> 18:05.593
whether it's gonna be a sequel

18:05.633 --> 18:06.980
to  You Always, You Never,

18:07.020 --> 18:08.613
-and the problem is...

18:08.653 --> 18:08.980
-Hmm.

18:09.020 --> 18:09.791
...nobody there

18:09.831 --> 18:11.151
has seen a manuscript.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.178
I mean,

18:12.218 --> 18:12.980
I haven't seen a manuscript.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.980
Have you seen a manuscript?

18:15.020 --> 18:17.539
Um, no, I have not seen

18:17.579 --> 18:18.980
a manuscript.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.980
Okay, the thing is...

18:22.020 --> 18:23.187
I was meant to get

18:23.227 --> 18:24.980
some answers the other day,

18:25.020 --> 18:26.257
and, and I didn't get

18:26.297 --> 18:26.980
any answers,

18:27.020 --> 18:27.629
-and if...

18:27.669 --> 18:28.538
and if I don't get...

18:28.578 --> 18:28.980
-Mmm-hmm.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.980
...any information soon, um...

18:32.020 --> 18:33.980
I'm gonna be in deep shit.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.012
So this is...

18:35.052 --> 18:36.980
this is really important,

18:37.020 --> 18:38.174
and I... I'd really

18:38.214 --> 18:39.980
appreciate it if you could...

18:40.020 --> 18:40.843
-Okay, yeah.

18:40.883 --> 18:41.980
-...help me out.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.080
I need... It's a really

18:43.120 --> 18:43.980
delicate situation,

18:44.020 --> 18:44.650
and, you know,

18:44.690 --> 18:45.980
I don't want to approach her

18:46.020 --> 18:46.985
at the wrong time,

18:47.025 --> 18:47.980
and I can't really

18:48.020 --> 18:48.919
get close enough to see

18:48.959 --> 18:49.980
what her frame of mind is.

18:50.020 --> 18:50.841
-Mmm-hmm.

18:50.881 --> 18:51.980
-And, and...

18:52.020 --> 18:53.291
And I thought maybe you

18:53.331 --> 18:54.980
could maybe give me a heads-up

18:55.020 --> 18:56.762
as to, you know,

18:56.802 --> 18:57.980
how she is,

18:58.020 --> 18:59.766
you know, whether she's okay,

18:59.806 --> 19:00.980
how's she's feeling,

19:01.020 --> 19:02.251
and just, you know,

19:02.291 --> 19:02.980
and then...

19:03.020 --> 19:03.523
-Right.

19:03.563 --> 19:04.000
-Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
[mysterious music playing]

19:29.000 --> 19:29.619
[Alice]  Today won't be

19:29.659 --> 19:29.980
any different

19:30.020 --> 19:31.097
-than any other day.

19:31.137 --> 19:31.980
-[knock on door]

19:32.020 --> 19:32.324
-[Tyler]  Okay.

19:32.364 --> 19:32.980
-[Alice]  And that will be...

19:33.020 --> 19:34.133
I'm going to start work

19:34.173 --> 19:34.980
on my manuscript,

19:35.020 --> 19:36.574
and then I'm going

19:36.614 --> 19:38.000
to swim at 3:00.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.980
Mmm-hmm.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.056
Butler will bring me...

19:41.096 --> 19:41.980
Pierre will bring me

19:42.020 --> 19:43.561
some sort of a lunch,

19:43.601 --> 19:44.980
I suppose, at 1:00.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.170
Then I'll swim,

19:46.210 --> 19:47.980
and then I'll come back

19:48.020 --> 19:49.171
and work for two

19:49.211 --> 19:49.980
more hours.

19:50.020 --> 19:50.963
Six o'clock, I'll start

19:51.003 --> 19:51.980
to get ready for dinner.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.584
Dinner at 7:00

19:53.624 --> 19:55.980
and then back to work

19:56.020 --> 19:58.000
or bed or both.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.980
I'll probably work in bed.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.691
And is there anything

20:03.731 --> 20:04.980
you need from me

20:05.020 --> 20:06.276
within, uh,

20:06.316 --> 20:08.980
working before lunch...

20:09.020 --> 20:09.485
No, most of what

20:09.525 --> 20:09.980
I want you to do

20:10.020 --> 20:12.000
is I just want you to...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.537
-take care of them...

20:14.577 --> 20:14.980
-Okay.

20:15.020 --> 20:15.798
And make sure

20:15.838 --> 20:16.980
that they're happy.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.001
You know, I just don't know

20:18.041 --> 20:19.601
what's going on with them.

20:20.000 --> 20:20.500
Mmm.

20:21.000 --> 20:21.525
You know,

20:21.565 --> 20:22.980
I tried last night to...

20:23.020 --> 20:23.980
What happened after I left?

20:24.020 --> 20:24.936
Did... did you go out

20:24.976 --> 20:25.980
with Roberta and Susan?

20:26.020 --> 20:26.451
-Um, no.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.980
-Did they go out together?

20:28.020 --> 20:28.484
Did they speak

20:28.524 --> 20:28.980
to each other?

20:29.020 --> 20:29.861
-Did they...

20:29.901 --> 20:31.980
-Um, I don't... I don't know.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.574
I was... I just...

20:33.614 --> 20:34.980
I just went home

20:35.020 --> 20:35.612
and started

20:35.652 --> 20:36.980
writing some stuff down.

20:37.020 --> 20:37.753
-You just went home?

20:37.793 --> 20:38.293
-Yeah.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.567
But, Ty...

20:39.607 --> 20:40.107
[sighs]

20:42.000 --> 20:43.731
This is... Part of what I...

20:43.771 --> 20:44.980
I really do want you

20:45.020 --> 20:46.183
to... to watch out

20:46.223 --> 20:46.980
over them...

20:47.020 --> 20:47.337
-Hmm.

20:47.377 --> 20:48.263
-...'cause I'm not able

20:48.303 --> 20:48.980
to be with them,

20:49.020 --> 20:49.405
and I don't know

20:49.445 --> 20:49.980
what they're thinking.

20:50.020 --> 20:50.852
-Oh, okay.

20:50.892 --> 20:51.062
-I don't know

20:51.102 --> 20:51.980
what they're saying.

20:52.020 --> 20:53.389
I don't know... I don't...

20:53.429 --> 20:53.980
I really...

20:54.020 --> 20:55.072
It's very important to me

20:55.112 --> 20:56.372
that I know something

20:57.000 --> 20:57.840
-of their state of mind.

20:57.880 --> 20:57.980
-Oh.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.980
Okay. Yeah.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.646
-I can... Absolutely,

21:01.686 --> 21:02.319
I'll, um... Um...

21:02.359 --> 21:02.980
-All right?

21:03.020 --> 21:04.152
-But I just want to--

21:04.192 --> 21:04.980
-You know what?

23:27.376 --> 23:28.980
about what it was like

23:29.020 --> 23:31.589
to... to come up together

23:31.629 --> 23:33.980
without any technology,

23:34.020 --> 23:36.746

23:36.786 --> 23:37.980
but feel like

23:38.020 --> 23:40.420
you have a glimpse

23:40.460 --> 23:42.980
into the experience

23:43.020 --> 23:43.523
of what

23:43.563 --> 23:45.000
it's like to not...

23:46.000 --> 23:48.352
be obscured by any

23:48.392 --> 23:50.980
sort of false selves

23:51.020 --> 23:53.980
or... or to really be intimate

23:54.020 --> 23:54.953
with each other

23:54.993 --> 23:55.980

23:56.020 --> 23:57.227

24:09.020 --> 24:11.588

24:11.628 --> 24:12.980
It is true that

24:13.020 --> 24:14.929
after your generation,

24:14.969 --> 24:15.980
I don't know

24:16.020 --> 24:17.387
who will carry

24:17.427 --> 24:19.000
the torch for...

24:20.000 --> 24:21.453
what really...

24:21.493 --> 24:24.000
What humanity really is.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.056
I don't think it's that

24:26.096 --> 24:26.980
different, you know?

24:27.020 --> 24:28.885
I, I know it, it...

24:28.925 --> 24:30.980
It's vastly different

24:31.020 --> 24:32.039
when you look at it

24:32.079 --> 24:33.099
from the outside.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.930
And what's happened

24:34.970 --> 24:35.980
to your generation...

24:36.020 --> 24:38.102
I mean, since you were two,

24:38.142 --> 24:39.980
you've been typing away,

24:40.020 --> 24:41.173
and so you've grown up

24:41.213 --> 24:41.980
with this thing

26:59.020 --> 26:59.980
Yes, I understand.

27:00.020 --> 27:03.000
What I don't understand...

27:04.000 --> 27:05.980
is how people...

27:06.020 --> 27:08.863
How you can read the...

27:08.903 --> 27:10.980
The prose just...

27:11.020 --> 27:12.520
That kind of writing

27:12.560 --> 27:13.980

27:15.418 --> 27:16.198

27:17.000 --> 27:17.980
But it's plot-driven.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.485
Yes, but the plots

27:19.525 --> 27:20.980
are so simplified.

27:21.020 --> 27:21.980

You know, you match the color

27:23.373 --> 27:23.980
and the shape,

27:24.020 --> 27:24.579
and then you put it

27:24.619 --> 27:24.980
all together.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.184
It's all very pat and

27:26.224 --> 27:26.980
neat and done.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.135
And then, you know,

27:28.175 --> 27:28.980
it's a picture

interested in sharing,

that was the direction

30:44.020 --> 30:44.446
-Yeah.

30:44.486 --> 30:45.980
-And so I don't know

30:46.020 --> 30:47.980
if you heard about that.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.050
Yeah, I heard...

30:49.090 --> 30:50.980
I heard something about that.

30:51.020 --> 30:51.980
Yeah, that's my dad.

30:52.020 --> 30:52.417
-Anyway...

30:52.457 --> 30:52.980
-[both laugh]

30:53.020 --> 30:54.279
-It's okay.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.000
-Um...

30:56.000 --> 30:56.980
So...

30:57.020 --> 30:59.127
Are you even or odd?

30:59.167 --> 30:59.980
I'm odd.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.980
Um, I'm even.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.980
Okay.

31:05.020 --> 31:05.463
-All right.

31:05.503 --> 31:05.980
-Good night.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.014
Good night.

31:07.054 --> 31:08.980
Um, see you tomorrow?

31:09.020 --> 31:10.980
Yeah, definitely.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.000
-Okay.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
[mellow music playing]

d

31:40.000 --> 31:40.980
d

31:41.020 --> 31:42.017
So it's strange

31:42.057 --> 31:42.980
to me the idea

31:43.020 --> 31:45.514
that she would come here

31:45.554 --> 31:46.980
and avoid you.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.980
It's very strange to me.

31:49.020 --> 31:49.472
It's very strange

31:49.512 --> 31:49.980
because she jumped

31:50.020 --> 31:51.980
at the opportunity.

31:52.020 --> 31:52.453
You know,

31:52.493 --> 31:53.980
she jumped at the invitation.

31:54.020 --> 31:54.371
Susan,

31:54.411 --> 31:55.980
it took two weeks for her

31:56.020 --> 31:57.180
to make all the arrangements

31:57.220 --> 31:57.980
from... In her life

31:58.020 --> 31:59.683
-to be able to leave, but...

31:59.723 --> 31:59.980
-Wow.

32:00.020 --> 32:01.127
Well, then maybe

32:01.167 --> 32:02.980
she's trying... She wanted

32:03.020 --> 32:04.980
to come here to...

32:05.020 --> 32:07.000
to make you uneasy.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.980
Oh, I don't...

32:11.020 --> 32:11.826
-Or she wanted--

32:11.866 --> 32:12.980
-Do you think she did?

32:13.020 --> 32:14.085
Well, maybe not as a whole,

32:14.125 --> 32:14.980
but, you know, some...

32:15.020 --> 32:16.980
Like, when I was a kid,

32:17.020 --> 32:19.564
I would get mad at my parents

32:19.604 --> 32:20.980
and yell at them

32:21.020 --> 32:23.516
-to see that they loved me.

32:23.556 --> 32:23.980
-Mmm.

32:24.020 --> 32:25.131
Do you know what I mean?

32:25.171 --> 32:25.980
I would hurt them.

32:26.020 --> 32:26.738
And when I saw

32:26.778 --> 32:27.980
the hurt in their eyes,

32:28.020 --> 32:29.683
-that told me they loved me.

32:29.723 --> 32:29.980
-Mmm.

32:30.020 --> 32:30.907
And that was a way

32:30.947 --> 32:31.980
of comforting myself.

32:32.020 --> 32:32.841
Mmm-hmm. Oh, gosh,

32:32.881 --> 32:33.980
well, that's a horrible,

32:34.020 --> 32:35.980
horrible thought.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.233
I hope that's not...

32:37.273 --> 32:37.980
That's true,

32:38.020 --> 32:38.750
and I'm sorry

32:38.790 --> 32:39.980
that happened to you.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.341
Well, I did it, so...

32:41.381 --> 32:41.980
[chuckles]

32:42.020 --> 32:42.412
-Yes.

32:42.452 --> 32:44.980
-Yes, but I don't think you...

32:45.020 --> 32:45.960
I'm sure your mother

32:46.000 --> 32:46.980
came through for you,

32:47.020 --> 32:48.768
but I can't imagine

32:48.808 --> 32:49.980
that Bud did.

32:50.020 --> 32:50.980
[clears throat]

32:51.020 --> 32:51.980
Right.

32:52.020 --> 32:54.980
Okay, this is the closest

32:55.020 --> 32:56.152
that I've been able

32:56.192 --> 32:57.980
to come to a viable candidate,

32:58.020 --> 32:59.084
Murray Dix.

32:59.124 --> 33:00.980
He makes shoelaces.

33:01.020 --> 33:01.722
I wish it were

33:01.762 --> 33:02.980
a little more glamorous,

33:03.020 --> 33:04.980
but I think he's got dough.

33:05.020 --> 33:07.141
I need you to find out

33:07.181 --> 33:09.980
how much dough he really has.

33:10.020 --> 33:11.284
Is it liquid?

33:11.324 --> 33:13.980
What's his marital history?

33:14.020 --> 33:15.980
Was...

33:16.020 --> 33:17.980
Did he abuse a wife?

33:18.020 --> 33:18.772
Did he... I mean,

33:18.812 --> 33:19.980
am I gonna survive if I...

33:20.020 --> 33:21.158
-Mmm-hmm.

33:21.198 --> 33:22.980
-Um... I, I...

33:23.020 --> 33:24.832
Are there any red flags?

33:24.872 --> 33:25.980
Did he do time?

33:26.020 --> 33:27.839
That would not be good for...

33:27.879 --> 33:29.000
for my reputation,

33:30.000 --> 33:30.720
-among other things.

33:30.760 --> 33:30.980
-Right.

33:31.020 --> 33:33.980
Right. Right.

-So can you--

33:34.374 --> 33:34.980
-Yeah, you want me to do

33:35.020 --> 33:36.980
a little forensic deep dive,

33:37.020 --> 33:37.599
-if you will.

33:37.639 --> 33:38.980
-Yes, I know you can do that.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.000
Yeah, I got you.

I hate my life.

I desperately want money.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.135
[laughs] I really want money,

36:03.175 --> 36:04.980
and I'm not in a position

36:05.020 --> 36:06.980
to meet a guy who has any.

36:07.020 --> 36:07.683
I mean,

I get these old codgers

who come into the store,

36:10.949 --> 36:11.980
and they want to buy a thong

for their teenage girlfriends,

rotten meat for them.

-[Susan] Oh, honey.

36:19.020 --> 36:20.980
[Roberta] But, um...

36:21.020 --> 36:23.103
You, you really do believe

36:23.143 --> 36:24.980
that Alice and her book

36:25.020 --> 36:25.953
just determined

36:25.993 --> 36:27.000
your whole life?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000

the quickest person

36:34.611 --> 36:35.980
around the place,

36:36.020 --> 36:39.980
but I read Alice's book.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.986
It never crossed my mind

36:43.026 --> 36:44.980
that it was you.

36:45.020 --> 36:47.121
It never crossed my mind

36:47.161 --> 36:48.980
that it was Crawford.

36:49.020 --> 36:52.538
It never crossed my mind that

36:52.578 --> 36:54.980
that mechanic guy...

36:55.020 --> 36:57.306
had anything to do

36:57.346 --> 36:58.980
with Roberta.

36:59.020 --> 36:59.470
Nothing.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.010
It never crossed my mind.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.863
Even though the character's

37:03.903 --> 37:04.980
name was Rowena?

37:05.020 --> 37:06.017
Why would I put

37:06.057 --> 37:06.980
that with you?

37:07.020 --> 37:08.437
Well, it crossed

37:08.477 --> 37:10.980
everyone else's mind, Susan.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.143
It certainly

37:12.183 --> 37:14.000
crossed Crawford's.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.741
And the judge agreed with him,

37:17.781 --> 37:19.041
so, you know, what...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.980
I got nothing.

37:22.020 --> 37:23.980
Oh, God, that's so awful.

37:24.020 --> 37:24.955
-Look, he was...

37:24.995 --> 37:25.980
-That's so awful.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.057
-I can't believe that.

37:27.097 --> 37:27.341
-He was a nice man.

37:27.381 --> 37:27.980
He was very wealthy.

37:28.020 --> 37:30.000
He took very good care of me.

37:32.000 --> 37:32.879
-Until...

37:32.919 --> 37:34.000
-He didn't.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.874
So are you seeing anyone

37:37.914 --> 37:38.980
at the moment?

37:39.020 --> 37:41.980
Um, no, no one right now.

37:42.020 --> 37:45.980
Um, I, um... Um...

37:46.020 --> 37:47.639
Okay, so the weirdest thing

37:47.679 --> 37:48.980
happened this morning.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.980
That guy...

37:51.020 --> 37:53.485
I think, was coming

37:53.525 --> 37:55.980
out of Alice's room

37:56.020 --> 37:57.266
when I went to go see her

37:57.306 --> 37:58.146
for breakfast.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.980
-What?

38:00.020 --> 38:00.980
-Yeah.

38:01.020 --> 38:01.647
Like, like,

38:01.687 --> 38:02.980
he'd stayed the night?

38:03.020 --> 38:05.520
Oh... maybe. I don't know.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.980
Uh, does that--

38:07.020 --> 38:07.634
Do you think

38:07.674 --> 38:08.980
they're having an affair?

38:09.020 --> 38:09.730
Again, yeah, I don't know,

38:09.770 --> 38:10.310
but it...

38:11.000 --> 38:12.980
I don't know why else...

38:13.020 --> 38:14.980
he'd be leaving her room

38:15.020 --> 38:15.867
or why she

38:15.907 --> 38:17.980
wouldn't tell me, but...

38:18.020 --> 38:19.044
Maybe she's having

38:19.084 --> 38:19.980
a secret affair.

38:20.020 --> 38:21.065
-Good for her.

38:21.105 --> 38:22.980
-[chuckles] I know, yeah.

38:23.020 --> 38:24.000
Oh, God.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.705
So I moved out, and I lived

38:26.745 --> 38:27.980
on my own for a bit,

38:28.020 --> 38:29.909
and then I got introduced

38:29.949 --> 38:31.980
to this guy called Jan, um,

38:32.020 --> 38:33.980
who is a hedge fund manager,

38:34.020 --> 38:35.181
and he works

38:35.221 --> 38:37.980
between New York and Zurich.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.241
So we started

38:39.281 --> 38:40.980
seeing each other.

38:41.020 --> 38:41.815
And things seemed

38:41.855 --> 38:42.980
to be going pretty well.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.980
Uh, we moved in together. Um...

38:46.020 --> 38:47.980
You know, I really...

38:48.020 --> 38:48.772
I felt like I was

38:48.812 --> 38:49.980
in a grown-up relationship

38:50.020 --> 38:50.874
-for the first time,

38:50.914 --> 38:51.786
like, he's quite serious.

38:51.826 --> 38:51.980
-Wow.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.275
Um, like, I felt like it

38:54.315 --> 38:54.753
was time that I...

38:54.793 --> 38:55.980
that I calmed down.

38:56.020 --> 38:56.957
Like, I don't know

38:56.997 --> 38:57.980
why I thought that,

38:58.020 --> 38:58.817
-but, like, in my mind...

38:58.857 --> 38:59.357
-Hmm.

39:00.000 --> 39:00.998
...I was like, you know,

39:01.038 --> 39:01.980
"It's time to grow up."

39:02.020 --> 39:02.400
-Huh.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.248
-Like, "This is it.

39:03.288 --> 39:03.980
He's the guy."

39:04.020 --> 39:04.153
-Wow.

39:04.193 --> 39:04.980
-"I'm gonna get married.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.564
I'm gonna have kids with him,

39:07.604 --> 39:08.980
and I'm just..."

39:09.020 --> 39:09.501
-Wow.

39:09.541 --> 39:10.839
-Yeah, "This is the next

39:10.879 --> 39:11.980
phase of my life."

39:12.020 --> 39:12.989
-Um, that's what

39:13.029 --> 39:13.359
I thought. Um...

39:13.399 --> 39:13.980
-[cup clatters]

39:14.020 --> 39:14.961
We talked about children,

39:15.001 --> 39:16.561
but he said he wasn't sure

39:17.000 --> 39:17.466
and he didn't know

39:17.506 --> 39:17.980
when he'd be ready,

39:18.020 --> 39:19.980
so, you know, he said,

39:20.020 --> 39:20.980
why don't I freeze my eggs?

39:21.020 --> 39:24.000
So last year I... I did that.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.980
Um...

39:27.020 --> 39:28.459
Even though, like, I thought

39:28.499 --> 39:29.980
that I'd be ready, like, now.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.027
Like, I mean, most of my

39:31.067 --> 39:31.980
friends have had kids.

39:32.020 --> 39:32.484
-And...

39:32.524 --> 39:33.000
-Right.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.480
You know, they've got

39:35.520 --> 39:36.980
families and, like...

39:37.020 --> 39:38.435
I don't know, it's funny when

39:38.475 --> 39:39.980
you get to this age as a woman.

39:40.020 --> 39:40.980
You feel a bit like

39:41.020 --> 39:42.728
if you're not doing that,

39:42.768 --> 39:43.980
you're gonna be...

39:44.020 --> 39:45.336
Well, you're gonna miss

39:45.376 --> 39:45.980
your chance

39:46.020 --> 39:47.913
-or you're gonna be, like...

39:47.810 --> 39:47.980
-Mmm.

39:47.953 --> 39:48.020
f

39:48.020 --> 39:49.183
-[voice breaks] ...left behind.

39:49.223 --> 39:49.980
-[both chuckle sadly]

39:50.020 --> 39:50.933
-Sorry, it's just...

39:50.973 --> 39:51.980
-No, that's all right.

39:52.020 --> 39:52.908
-Are you all right?

39:52.948 --> 39:53.980
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.256
I'm fine. I just haven't really

39:55.296 --> 39:55.980
talked about this.

39:56.020 --> 39:58.000
Um...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.254
-Sorry.

40:00.294 --> 40:01.000
-Oh.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.800
It's ridiculous, really. Um...

40:04.000 --> 40:07.695
I don't know.

40:07.735 --> 40:07.980
d

40:08.020 --> 40:08.301
It's so crazy,

40:08.341 --> 40:08.980
like, you go through your 20s,

40:09.020 --> 40:10.207
and you're, like, "I better not

40:10.247 --> 40:10.980
fucking get pregnant

40:11.020 --> 40:11.609
'cause that would be

40:11.649 --> 40:12.369
a disaster."

40:13.000 --> 40:13.329
-Right, right.

40:13.369 --> 40:13.980
-And then when you hit 35,

40:14.020 --> 40:14.712
everyone's like,

40:14.752 --> 40:15.980
"Are you thinking about it?"

40:16.020 --> 40:16.407
Like, should you...

40:16.447 --> 40:17.960
"Are you gonna have kids?"

40:18.000 --> 40:19.367
So it all kind of changes

40:19.407 --> 40:19.980
so quickly,

40:20.020 --> 40:21.336
and I thought that

40:21.376 --> 40:22.980
that was gonna happen,

40:23.020 --> 40:23.738
that Jan and I

40:23.778 --> 40:24.980
were gonna get married.

40:25.020 --> 40:25.880
-So it just, like,

40:25.920 --> 40:26.762
threw me when, like...

40:26.802 --> 40:26.980
-Huh.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.028
...two months ago, he...

40:29.068 --> 40:30.980
Well, he just ended it.

40:31.020 --> 40:32.980
And...

40:33.020 --> 40:35.239
-like, I was basically homeless

40:35.279 --> 40:36.138
'cause it was his place.

40:36.178 --> 40:36.980
-[gasps softly]

40:37.020 --> 40:38.000
And, um...

40:40.000 --> 40:40.531
Yeah, I'm just...

40:40.571 --> 40:41.411
Guess I'm just

40:42.000 --> 40:42.771
still working

40:42.811 --> 40:43.980
through all of that.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.000
Um...

41:01.000 --> 41:02.150
-[woman] Good afternoon.

41:02.190 --> 41:02.980
-[Roberta] Hello.

41:03.020 --> 41:03.818
Uh, I was given

41:03.858 --> 41:04.980
this gift certificate

41:05.020 --> 41:06.098
for a supreme

41:06.138 --> 41:07.980
manicure and pedicure,

41:08.020 --> 41:09.344
which is very nice,

41:09.384 --> 41:10.980
but I don't like people

41:11.020 --> 41:11.980
touching my hands or feet,

41:12.020 --> 41:13.232
so I would like to redeem it

41:13.272 --> 41:13.980
for cash, please.

41:14.020 --> 41:14.722
Unfortunately,

41:14.762 --> 41:15.980
we can't do that, madam,

41:16.020 --> 41:17.287
but we can offer you

41:17.327 --> 41:18.980
another treatment instead.

41:19.020 --> 41:21.980
Uh, could I redeem it...

41:22.020 --> 41:22.929
Could you put it

41:22.969 --> 41:23.980
on my credit card?

41:24.020 --> 41:25.487
Unfortunately, no, because

41:25.527 --> 41:26.980
it is a complimentary one,

41:27.020 --> 41:27.985
so we would be able

41:28.025 --> 41:28.980
to just transfer it

41:29.020 --> 41:29.980
to a different treatment.

41:30.020 --> 41:30.769
Let me show you

41:30.809 --> 41:32.189
what we have available.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.535
For the money that you have,

41:34.575 --> 41:36.135
you can have any of these.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.980
Do men get massages here, too?

41:40.020 --> 41:41.131
We do. We do do massages

41:41.171 --> 41:41.980
for everyone, yes.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.576
Do you have any men getting

41:43.616 --> 41:44.980
a massage at the moment?

41:45.020 --> 41:46.273
We do at the moment,

41:46.313 --> 41:46.980
yes, madam.

41:47.020 --> 41:47.523
What kind of massage

41:47.563 --> 41:47.980
are they getting?

41:48.020 --> 41:49.350
They have all sorts of...

41:49.390 --> 41:50.980
All the different types we do.

41:51.020 --> 41:51.669
At the moment,

41:51.709 --> 41:52.980
we have got a gentleman in.

41:53.020 --> 41:54.760
He's having a sports massage.

41:55.000 --> 41:55.883
Ah, well, I would like

41:55.923 --> 41:56.980
to have the sports massage.

41:57.020 --> 41:57.653
-The sports massage? Okay.

41:57.693 --> 41:57.980
-Yes, please.

41:58.020 --> 41:59.980
d

42:00.020 --> 42:01.980
[steam hissing]

42:02.020 --> 42:06.000
[clattering continues]

42:08.000 --> 42:09.044
-[Kelvin] They're

42:09.084 --> 42:09.090
the same price?

42:09.130 --> 42:10.690
-[waiter] Same price, yes.

42:12.000 --> 42:12.525
Let's say

42:12.565 --> 42:13.980
we went to the Bordeaux,

42:14.020 --> 42:15.980
just in case.

42:16.020 --> 42:16.980
He went like this.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.980
Now he's going like this.

42:20.020 --> 42:21.946
[Tyler] Why don't you go up

42:21.986 --> 42:23.980
to him and, and talk to him?

42:24.020 --> 42:26.980
Tyler, I would never do that.

42:27.020 --> 42:27.586
-He really seems--

42:27.626 --> 42:27.980
-Oh, my God.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.784
You can't be intimidated

42:29.824 --> 42:30.980
by Kelvin Kra...

42:31.020 --> 42:32.033
-[whispering] Kelvin--

42:32.073 --> 42:32.980
-[Susan] Oh, my God.

42:33.020 --> 42:34.410
[Tyler] He seems...

42:34.450 --> 42:35.980
He seemed really nice

42:36.020 --> 42:36.487
to all the people who were

42:36.527 --> 42:37.960
going up to him yesterday.

42:38.000 --> 42:38.531
-[Susan] Really?

42:38.571 --> 42:38.980
-It's just...

42:39.020 --> 42:40.003
-Oh, I'm not surprised.

42:40.043 --> 42:40.980
-[Tyler clears throat]

42:41.020 --> 42:42.840
I think he's probably

42:42.880 --> 42:43.980
a lovely man.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.520
Speaking of writing,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.000
how is yours going?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.980
Thank you for asking me that.

42:54.020 --> 42:55.980
Um...

42:56.020 --> 42:56.267
d

42:56.307 --> 42:59.980
Well, it's...

43:00.020 --> 43:01.980
it's not going, actually.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.980
It's not going.

43:04.020 --> 43:05.928
I've been whining

43:05.968 --> 43:07.980
to Tyler about it.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.299
I'm sorry for doing that,

43:09.339 --> 43:10.119
but I just...

43:11.000 --> 43:12.014
Oh, I've hit a...

43:12.054 --> 43:12.980
I've hit a wall.

43:13.020 --> 43:13.980
Sometimes it happens.

43:14.020 --> 43:16.841
Sometimes you hit...

43:16.881 --> 43:18.980
You're blocked.

43:19.020 --> 43:20.756
-Well, maybe you should

43:20.796 --> 43:21.332
take a breather.

43:21.372 --> 43:21.980
-So... Mmm.

43:22.020 --> 43:22.980
You want to have tea tomorrow?

43:23.020 --> 43:24.980
We could go to the...

43:25.020 --> 43:27.000
The Chart Room has a nice tea.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I would love to.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.454
[Karen]  Uh, I didn't know

43:36.494 --> 43:37.980
whether you'd be up for it,

43:38.020 --> 43:38.815
but have you been

43:38.855 --> 43:40.295
to a planetarium before?

43:41.000 --> 43:41.531
No. Never.

43:41.571 --> 43:42.980
Or maybe when I was a kid.

43:43.020 --> 43:45.790
Okay, um, do you like stars,

43:45.830 --> 43:47.980
planets, the universe?

43:48.020 --> 43:49.580
Yeah, I love the universe.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.480
[chuckles] Okay.

43:51.520 --> 43:51.770
Well, hopefully,

43:51.810 --> 43:52.980
you should enjoy this.

43:53.020 --> 43:55.305
[narrator]  The night sky,

43:55.345 --> 43:57.980
both beautiful and mysterious.

43:58.020 --> 43:59.052
The subject

43:59.092 --> 44:00.980
of campfire stories,

44:01.020 --> 44:03.980
ancient myths, and awe

44:04.020 --> 44:04.574
for as long

44:04.614 --> 44:06.174
as there have been people.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.436
Living beneath the open,

44:08.476 --> 44:08.980
dark sky,

44:09.020 --> 44:10.564
the earliest humans

44:10.604 --> 44:12.980
were aware of nightly changes

44:13.020 --> 44:14.624
as planets marched

44:14.664 --> 44:15.980
across the sky.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.980
The moon waxed and waned,

44:18.020 --> 44:19.818
and occasional meteors

44:19.858 --> 44:21.980
flared across the horizon.

44:22.020 --> 44:23.485
Slowly, the simple

44:23.525 --> 44:24.980
early observations

44:25.020 --> 44:26.119
revealed patterns

44:26.159 --> 44:27.980
that could be depended upon,

44:28.020 --> 44:29.985
leading to the first

44:30.025 --> 44:30.980
calendars.

44:31.020 --> 44:32.297
With the yearly cycle

44:32.337 --> 44:33.000
mapped out,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.283
settlements in agriculture

44:35.323 --> 44:35.980
could develop,

44:36.020 --> 44:36.854
and early

44:36.894 --> 44:39.000
civilizations thrived.

44:40.000 --> 44:40.793
At the same time,

44:40.833 --> 44:41.980
the first maps of the sky

44:42.020 --> 44:43.910
grouped the brightest stars

44:43.950 --> 44:46.000
into familiar constellations,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.298
helping to develop

44:48.338 --> 44:49.980
navigational schemes...

44:50.020 --> 44:53.000
d

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
[machinery humming]

45:24.000 --> 45:25.980
Good evening, madam.

45:26.020 --> 45:26.435
-Hello.

45:26.475 --> 45:27.980
-Um, how can I help you?

45:28.020 --> 45:28.980
I think you seem to be lost.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.122
Oh, no, no, I'm not lost.

45:30.162 --> 45:30.980
I'm just wandering.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.653
Yeah, you're not actually

45:32.693 --> 45:33.980
allowed in this area

45:34.020 --> 45:34.523
because this is part

45:34.563 --> 45:34.980
of the crew area.

45:35.020 --> 45:35.571
-Oh, okay.

45:35.611 --> 45:36.980
-And you're not insured.

45:37.020 --> 45:38.980
So, if anything does happen...

45:39.020 --> 45:40.290
-Okay, where shall I go?

45:40.330 --> 45:41.980
-So where would you like to go,

45:42.020 --> 45:43.980
and I can escort you, please?

45:44.020 --> 45:45.040
Okay, no problem.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.980
[waves splashing]

45:52.020 --> 45:53.000
[sighs]

46:37.000 --> 46:37.549
[Karen]  Kelvin Kranz

46:37.589 --> 46:37.980
is on this ship?

46:38.020 --> 46:40.980
[Tyler]  Mmm-hmm.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.036
Wait, is he...

46:42.076 --> 46:43.980
Is that a really big deal?

46:44.020 --> 46:44.641
Come on, you have to have

46:44.681 --> 46:44.980
heard of him.

46:45.020 --> 46:45.612
[Tyler] No,

46:45.652 --> 46:46.980
I've never heard of him.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.980
[scoffs] I mean, he's huge.

46:49.020 --> 46:50.653
Like, the guy's a one-man

46:50.693 --> 46:51.980
publishing industry.

46:52.020 --> 46:52.241
-Really?

46:52.281 --> 46:52.980
-Like, every single one

46:53.020 --> 46:53.634
of his books

46:53.674 --> 46:54.980
gets adapted into a film.

46:55.020 --> 46:55.710
-I mean, every language...

46:55.750 --> 46:55.980
-Oh, okay.

46:56.020 --> 46:56.611
...his books

46:56.651 --> 46:57.980
have been translated into.

46:58.020 --> 46:58.771
-[Tyler] Okay, Kelvin.

46:58.811 --> 46:58.980
-Yeah.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.135
-[Tyler] I see you.

47:00.175 --> 47:00.980
-He's massive.

47:01.020 --> 47:02.062
[Karen] Like, bigger than all

47:02.102 --> 47:02.980
of them combined, like...

47:03.020 --> 47:04.072
[Tyler] Good for...

47:04.112 --> 47:04.980
good for Kelvin.

47:05.020 --> 47:05.834
-[Karen] Yeah.

47:05.874 --> 47:06.980
-Good for that guy.

47:07.020 --> 47:09.502
Um, so I had a thought

47:09.542 --> 47:11.000
that I was...

47:12.000 --> 47:13.980
Do you... Do you like dancing?

56:18.599 --> 56:20.980
another universe.

56:21.020 --> 56:23.000
Blodwen Pugh...

56:24.000 --> 56:25.980
was a Welsh writer

56:26.020 --> 56:26.695
at the turn

56:26.735 --> 56:28.000
of the last century,

56:29.000 --> 56:29.980
the end of the 19th century.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.460
She worked in obscurity.

56:32.000 --> 56:32.437
She, uh,

56:32.477 --> 56:33.980
was completely unrecognized

56:34.020 --> 56:36.980
until well after her death.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.067
And even now,

56:38.107 --> 56:39.980
she's quite unfamiliar,

56:40.020 --> 56:41.424
even to many in the most

56:41.464 --> 56:42.980
rarefied literary circles.

56:43.020 --> 56:45.980
She's, uh...

56:46.020 --> 56:47.018
She's lost to us,

56:47.058 --> 56:47.980
except for those

56:48.020 --> 56:50.049
who stand still enough

56:50.089 --> 56:50.980
to listen.

56:51.020 --> 56:52.192
The writings,

56:52.232 --> 56:54.980
her one rema... her one novel,

56:55.020 --> 56:56.437
which is called,

56:56.477 --> 56:58.980
I think it's the masterpiece

56:59.020 --> 57:00.980
of that... of that era

57:01.020 --> 57:03.000
is called "Realm of the Owl."

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
When I read this novel,

57:07.000 --> 57:09.980
it's... it's impossible for me

57:10.020 --> 57:11.111
not to think

57:11.151 --> 57:12.980
what a miracle it is

57:13.020 --> 57:14.980
that this universe emerged.

57:15.020 --> 57:16.980
What a miracle it is

57:17.020 --> 57:20.980
that consciousness emerged.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.000
You know?

57:26.000 --> 57:27.617
And what a miracle it is

57:27.657 --> 57:29.000
that Blodwyn Pugh...

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
her thoughts and experiences...

57:34.000 --> 57:36.380
that they could reach

57:36.420 --> 57:38.000
across time...

57:40.000 --> 57:41.139
and reach

57:41.179 --> 57:44.000
into my consciousness.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.980
That's a miracle.

57:48.020 --> 57:50.000
Any questions?

57:53.000 --> 57:54.980
[man] Well, I have a question.

57:55.020 --> 57:57.141
I mean, I don't know,

57:57.181 --> 57:57.778
it certainly raise

57:57.818 --> 57:58.980
to Blodwyn Pugh's

57:59.020 --> 58:00.410
"Realm of the Owl,"

58:00.450 --> 58:01.980
but I have a question

58:02.020 --> 58:04.980
about "A Function of the Body"

58:05.020 --> 58:07.128
and, uh, specifically when you

58:07.168 --> 58:08.980
were inspired to write it,

58:09.020 --> 58:09.935
did you always know

58:09.975 --> 58:10.980
you were gonna insert

58:11.020 --> 58:12.485
Georgia's diaries

58:12.525 --> 58:13.980
through the book?

58:14.020 --> 58:15.980
Um...

58:16.020 --> 58:17.980
I thought it was, uh...

58:18.020 --> 58:19.828
exquisitely crafted

58:19.868 --> 58:20.980
in that way.

58:21.020 --> 58:22.514
And, I mean, everyone knows

58:22.554 --> 58:24.114
it's a very personal book.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.778
It's known, so I don't feel

58:26.818 --> 58:27.980
badly saying that,

58:28.020 --> 58:28.735
and, I mean,

58:28.775 --> 58:29.980
the way you did that

58:30.020 --> 58:30.832
with her...

58:30.872 --> 58:33.000
With the loss of her sister,

58:34.000 --> 58:35.903
the ne'er-do-well brother

58:35.943 --> 58:37.980
who's sort of a psychopath,

58:38.020 --> 58:39.248
whom you need, you know,

58:39.288 --> 58:40.128
whom you need,

58:41.000 --> 58:44.980
and who you're terrified of.

58:45.020 --> 58:45.774
It... The way

58:45.814 --> 58:46.980
those diaries worked

58:47.020 --> 58:47.810
just raised it

58:47.850 --> 58:48.980
to the highest level

58:49.020 --> 58:51.980
of, uh... of literature for me.

58:52.020 --> 58:53.831
I'm wondering how you...

58:53.871 --> 58:55.980
how you... how you did that.

58:56.020 --> 58:56.634
Did you know

58:56.674 --> 58:57.980
you were gonna do it or--

58:58.020 --> 58:58.980
[Alice] Oh, thank you.

58:59.020 --> 59:00.013
Thank you very much

59:00.053 --> 59:01.133
for that question.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.980
d

59:04.020 --> 59:08.000
[elegant music playing]

59:11.000 --> 59:12.570
-My dad, at least.

59:12.610 --> 59:13.980
-[Alice] Oh, my.

59:14.020 --> 59:15.980
Oh, my. Oh.

59:16.020 --> 59:16.700
-Oh, your friends have come.

59:16.740 --> 59:16.980
-[chuckles]

59:17.020 --> 59:17.855
My friends,

59:17.895 --> 59:19.980
I want you to meet Roberta.

59:20.020 --> 59:20.215
-Hello.

59:20.255 --> 59:20.980
-What a great pleasure.

59:21.020 --> 59:22.434
-Thank you. You too. Big fan.

59:22.474 --> 59:22.980
-And Susan.

59:23.020 --> 59:24.205
-What a good pleasure.

59:24.245 --> 59:24.980
-Kelvin Kranz.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.899
-And my nephew Tyler.

59:26.939 --> 59:27.980
-Hey. Tyler.

59:28.020 --> 59:28.933
-Handsome young man.

59:28.973 --> 59:29.980
-Oh, nice to meet you.

59:30.020 --> 59:30.980
Nice to meet you.

59:31.020 --> 59:31.574
So you all,

59:31.614 --> 59:32.980
you're traveling together.

59:33.020 --> 59:34.697
Yes. You have a table

59:34.737 --> 59:36.980
full of fans here, you know?

59:37.020 --> 59:38.538
Really? Well, that's fantastic,

59:38.578 --> 59:38.980
you know.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.392
-Oh, thank you.

59:40.432 --> 59:41.980
-[Roberta laughs]

59:42.020 --> 59:44.168
So you must be all going

59:44.208 --> 59:46.980
to "The Toad and the Harrow"...

59:47.020 --> 59:47.980
Oh, well, yes...

59:48.020 --> 59:48.420
Are you taking

59:48.460 --> 59:48.980
your friends over?

59:49.020 --> 59:50.708
-Is that what's happening here?

59:50.748 --> 59:50.980
-Yes.

59:51.020 --> 59:52.160
But first, we're gonna make

59:52.200 --> 59:52.980
a little pilgrimage

59:53.020 --> 59:55.499
to Blodwyn Pugh's gravesite

59:55.539 --> 59:56.980
outside Cardiff.

59:57.020 --> 59:58.021
-[Kelvin] Hmm.

59:58.061 --> 59:58.980
-The convent.

59:59.020 --> 59:59.592
[Kelvin] How wonderful.

59:59.632 --> 59:59.980
That's special.

1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:01.820
[Alice] Yeah, yeah, I think...

1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:03.000
I think it'll be...

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:05.980
sort of special, but, uh...

1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:07.220
I wanted to ask you,

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.017
how long does it take you

1:00:09.057 --> 1:00:10.437
to write one of your...

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:12.080
one of your books?

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.359
-To... to write one?

1:00:14.399 --> 1:00:14.980
-Mmm-hmm.

1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:17.000
Well, I spend about, maybe,

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.980
a month outlining it,

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:21.761
and then, maybe,

1:00:21.801 --> 1:00:24.980
three months, uh, writing it,

1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:26.980
so maybe four months...

1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.105
At the outside, some of them

1:00:28.145 --> 1:00:28.980
maybe four and a half.

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:29.483
-Oh.

1:00:29.523 --> 1:00:30.980
-I try to...

1:00:31.020 --> 1:00:32.456
I've never done anything

1:00:32.496 --> 1:00:33.980
faster than three months.

1:00:34.020 --> 1:00:34.980
That's longer than I thought.

1:00:35.020 --> 1:00:35.766
-Uh...

1:00:35.806 --> 1:00:38.000
-[laughs] Well...

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.980
That's interesting.

1:00:41.020 --> 1:00:43.980
It's a process, isn't it?

1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:44.980
Well, I have a certain process.

1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:46.772
-It's pretty specific,

1:00:46.812 --> 1:00:47.405
you know? Um...

1:00:47.445 --> 1:00:48.000
-Mmm-hmm.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.980
Well, anyway...

1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:51.400
congratulations

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:52.700
on getting the prize.

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:53.980
Oh, thank you so much.

1:00:54.020 --> 1:00:54.825
It's a great honor.

1:00:54.865 --> 1:00:55.980
I think it's very special.

1:00:56.020 --> 1:00:57.072
And what a pleasure

1:00:57.112 --> 1:00:57.980
to meet you all.

1:00:58.020 --> 1:00:59.446
-[Roberta] Thank you. You too.

1:00:59.486 --> 1:00:59.980
-Take care.

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:00.841
-Thank you. Thank you.

1:01:00.881 --> 1:01:01.807
-[Kelvin] I'll see you again,

1:01:01.847 --> 1:01:01.980
yeah.

1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:02.627
-And you.

1:01:02.667 --> 1:01:03.735
I'll see you again.

1:01:03.775 --> 1:01:03.980
-Ah.

1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:04.397
-See you soon.

1:01:04.437 --> 1:01:04.980
-Take care, bye-bye.

1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:06.000
Bye-bye.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:07.706
-[Kelvin] Have a nice supper.

1:01:07.746 --> 1:01:07.980
-Thank you.

1:01:08.020 --> 1:01:09.980
You too.

1:01:10.020 --> 1:01:10.920
-[camera beeps]

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:11.980
-[shutter clicks]

1:01:12.020 --> 1:01:12.980
What a nice man.

1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:14.980
[chuckles]

1:01:15.020 --> 1:01:15.337
-Wow.

1:01:15.377 --> 1:01:16.980
-What a gent, isn't he?

1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:19.980
What a gentleman. Classy.

1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.980
[Alice clears throat]

1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:24.274
-Missed you today.

1:01:24.314 --> 1:01:25.980
-Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:27.011
-Why don't we go now?

1:01:27.051 --> 1:01:27.631
Have a little drink?

1:01:27.671 --> 1:01:27.980
-I can't.

1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:28.630
-I can't.

1:01:28.670 --> 1:01:28.980
-Why?

1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:30.980
'Cause I'm going to the gala.

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:32.000
Oh, the gala.

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000
Okay.

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.980
d

1:01:46.020 --> 1:01:47.561
[Karen] They're such

1:01:47.601 --> 1:01:48.980
iconic characters.

1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:50.083
[Kelvin] Well, it is perfect

1:01:50.123 --> 1:01:50.980
for American characters

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:51.528
right now

1:01:51.568 --> 1:01:52.980
because the border of...

1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:53.750
-[Tyler] Hey.

1:01:53.790 --> 1:01:53.980
-Hi.

1:01:54.020 --> 1:01:54.814
-Oh, you're here. Great.

1:01:54.854 --> 1:01:55.354
-Hey.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:56.582
You guys have met,

1:01:56.622 --> 1:01:56.980
haven't you?

1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:58.000
Yeah.

1:01:59.000 --> 1:01:59.437
-How's it going?

1:01:59.477 --> 1:01:59.663
Sorry to interrupt.

1:01:59.703 --> 1:01:59.980
-It's going good.

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:00.397
No, you're not

1:02:00.437 --> 1:02:00.980
interrupting at all.

1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:02.980
We're just finishing up.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:03.549
-Good to see you, man.

1:02:03.589 --> 1:02:03.980
-Good to see you.

1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:04.504
-Yeah.

1:02:04.544 --> 1:02:05.980
-Leave you to it.

1:02:06.020 --> 1:02:06.591
-So lovely to talk to you.

1:02:06.631 --> 1:02:06.980
-To be continued?

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:07.174
-Yes.

1:02:07.214 --> 1:02:07.980
-We'll see each other

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:09.986
-again soon.

1:02:10.026 --> 1:02:10.980
-Yeah.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:13.341
-Sorry to run you out of town.

1:02:13.381 --> 1:02:14.980
-No, are you kidding?

1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:16.000
Have a good one.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.435
-How's it going?

1:02:18.475 --> 1:02:18.980
-Um...

1:02:19.020 --> 1:02:21.980
does he know who you are?

1:02:22.020 --> 1:02:22.779
Oh, yeah.

1:02:22.819 --> 1:02:24.980
Yeah, he knows, he knows.

1:02:25.020 --> 1:02:26.080
-And that doesn't bother you?

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:26.980
-He's cool. Don't worry.

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:27.936
No, he, um...

1:02:27.976 --> 1:02:29.980
He's not gonna say anything.

1:02:30.020 --> 1:02:30.850
-Don't worry.

1:02:30.890 --> 1:02:31.980
-So you know that

1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:32.980
him and Alice are now...

1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:34.550
-friends, they're talking.

1:02:34.590 --> 1:02:35.980
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1:02:36.020 --> 1:02:36.980
Yeah, no, I, um...

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:37.561
Actually,

1:02:37.601 --> 1:02:38.980
I told him everything,

1:02:39.020 --> 1:02:41.682
and he found the whole thing

1:02:41.722 --> 1:02:43.980
quite amusing, actually.

1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:44.400
-Hmm.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.156
-Um, and he gave me

1:02:45.196 --> 1:02:45.980
some good advice.

1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:46.916
He, uh...

1:02:46.956 --> 1:02:48.980
he told me he thinks

1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:50.389
it's probably not gonna be

1:02:50.429 --> 1:02:50.980
a good idea

1:02:51.020 --> 1:02:51.636
for me to approach Alice

1:02:51.676 --> 1:02:52.456
on this trip,

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.045
so I'm gonna back off,

1:02:55.085 --> 1:02:55.980
and, um...

1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.559
-Yeah, I think he's right.

1:02:57.599 --> 1:02:58.099
-Great.

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000
[mellow music playing]

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000
d

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:42.718
[Tyler]  Did you get that note,

1:03:42.758 --> 1:03:43.418
by the way,

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.980
that we left in your room?

1:03:46.020 --> 1:03:46.929
[Alice]  What...

1:03:46.969 --> 1:03:47.980
A note is nothing.

1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:48.662
I mean,

1:03:48.702 --> 1:03:50.980
she made a date with me,

1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.980
and, for tea, and I went,

1:03:54.020 --> 1:03:55.580
and I interrupted my work.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.426
It's not like I have hours

1:03:57.466 --> 1:03:58.980
and hours to wander the ship

1:03:59.020 --> 1:04:00.546
-and, you know, meet men.

1:04:00.586 --> 1:04:01.086
-Right.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:02.360
This is not

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:02.980
what I'm here for.

1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:03.858
Wait, so you went,

1:04:03.898 --> 1:04:04.980
and then what happened?

1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:05.750
I went to tea

1:04:05.790 --> 1:04:06.980
at two o'clock sharp,

1:04:07.020 --> 1:04:08.161
and there she was,

1:04:08.201 --> 1:04:09.980
sitting there like a beanbag

1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:11.485
next to this dodo

1:04:11.525 --> 1:04:12.980
who was her date.

1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:14.513
And, clearly,

1:04:14.553 --> 1:04:16.980
I wasn't, you know...

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:17.605
-[scoffs]

1:04:17.645 --> 1:04:18.980
-So she canceled it?

1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:19.769
It was canceled.

1:04:19.809 --> 1:04:20.980
You didn't meet with her.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:21.374
Well, I don't know

1:04:21.414 --> 1:04:21.980
what we were supposed to do,

1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:24.980
have a... a meeting with a...

1:04:25.020 --> 1:04:25.784
-A dodo?

1:04:25.824 --> 1:04:27.980
-A person that... Yes.

1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:29.980
I shouldn't say that.

1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:32.570
He's probably a perfectly nice,

1:04:32.610 --> 1:04:33.980
unsuspecting man,

1:04:34.020 --> 1:04:36.256
who didn't know that he was,

1:04:36.296 --> 1:04:36.980
you know,

1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:38.241
in the talons

1:04:38.281 --> 1:04:39.980
of a carrion bird.

1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:41.373
-But I don't know what...

1:04:41.413 --> 1:04:41.980
-[laughing]

1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:42.946
I don't know what she's...

1:04:42.986 --> 1:04:43.980
I don't know what she wants,

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:45.298
because I just

1:04:45.338 --> 1:04:46.980
want to reach her.

1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:47.980
Right.

1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:48.927
[Roberta] Do you remember

1:04:48.967 --> 1:04:49.980
when you and Alice and I met

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:51.320
in San Francisco

1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:52.980
all those years ago?

1:04:53.020 --> 1:04:56.000
That's when it all hit the fan.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.980
I just was desperate

1:05:01.020 --> 1:05:02.980
to confide in someone,

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.574
and the two of you

1:05:04.614 --> 1:05:05.980
were the closest

1:05:06.020 --> 1:05:07.580
I've ever been with, so...

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:10.980
[sighs] When we had dinner

1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:12.090
at the bar afterward,

1:05:12.130 --> 1:05:12.980
you went upstairs

1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:14.050
and went to bed,

1:05:14.090 --> 1:05:15.980
and it was just me and Alice,

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:17.980
and I thought...

1:05:18.020 --> 1:05:19.804
"Well, Alice has always

1:05:19.844 --> 1:05:20.980
been interested

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:23.000
in other people's lives."

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:25.448
And then I made

1:05:25.488 --> 1:05:25.980
the fatal mistake

1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:28.000
of telling Alice everything.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000
[sighs]

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.200
What I realize is...

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.361
if you can't keep

1:05:37.401 --> 1:05:39.000
a secret yourself...

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.764
you can't ask anyone else

1:05:41.804 --> 1:05:43.000
to keep a secret.

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000
It's true.

1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000
It's true.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000
[chuckles]

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.000
Um...

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.208
what I'm gonna tell you

1:06:10.248 --> 1:06:11.000
is this.

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.980
Uh...

1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:15.986
I didn't go upstairs

1:06:16.026 --> 1:06:18.000
to sleep that night.

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.064
Um, there was

1:06:20.104 --> 1:06:21.000
a really...

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.000
a really cute waiter,

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.000
and, uh...

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000
This is a...

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000
double letter, triple word.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:38.780
-Baby.

1:06:38.820 --> 1:06:39.980
-[laughs]

1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:40.810
-I hate you.

1:06:40.850 --> 1:06:41.980
-Bow down, bitch.

1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:42.461
-[laughs]

1:06:42.501 --> 1:06:42.980
-Bow down.

1:06:43.020 --> 1:06:43.919
[Karen]  They have this

1:06:43.959 --> 1:06:44.980
incredible night together.

1:06:45.020 --> 1:06:46.980
They get really drunk.

1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:47.724
-They drink loads of cocktails.

1:06:47.764 --> 1:06:47.980
-[laughing]

1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:48.961
Um, and, yeah,

1:06:49.001 --> 1:06:51.000
they just get on really well.

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:52.590
-They hook up.

1:06:52.630 --> 1:06:52.980
-Mmm-hmm.

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:53.588
And she doesn't know

1:06:53.628 --> 1:06:53.980
that this guy

1:06:54.020 --> 1:06:56.980
is actually just a bartender.

1:06:57.020 --> 1:06:59.024
Like, he's not a rich guy

1:06:59.064 --> 1:07:00.980
or anything, like, um...

1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:02.920
But they fall for each other,

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.980
and it's this comedy of errors.

1:07:05.020 --> 1:07:07.215
-Um, it's kind of a farce.

1:07:07.255 --> 1:07:07.980
-Mmm-hmm.

1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:08.769
But they end up

1:07:08.809 --> 1:07:09.980
falling for each other,

1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:11.404
despite the fact that,

1:07:11.444 --> 1:07:11.980
you know,

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:12.496
-they're both pretending to be

1:07:12.536 --> 1:07:12.879
something that they're not...

1:07:12.919 --> 1:07:12.980
-Right.

1:07:13.020 --> 1:07:14.612
...which is kind of the...

1:07:14.652 --> 1:07:15.980
yeah, the whole thing.

1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:16.894
And do you know

1:07:16.934 --> 1:07:17.980
who plays the guy?

1:07:18.020 --> 1:07:18.666
He's this...

1:07:18.706 --> 1:07:19.980
oh, he's this comedian.

1:07:20.020 --> 1:07:20.669
He's so funny.

1:07:20.709 --> 1:07:22.329
He's got this amazing face.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.040
But it's just such

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:24.980
a charming film.

1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:25.545
You have to see it.

1:07:25.585 --> 1:07:25.980
It's brilliant.

1:07:26.020 --> 1:07:27.484
-I want to see it.

1:07:27.524 --> 1:07:27.980
-Yeah.

1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:28.619
I'm trying to think

1:07:28.659 --> 1:07:28.980
of, like...

1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:30.470
I was actually in a comedy

1:07:30.510 --> 1:07:30.980
of errors

1:07:31.020 --> 1:07:32.382
when I was in sixth grade,

1:07:32.422 --> 1:07:33.980
so when you brought that up...

1:07:34.020 --> 1:07:34.586
-Yeah.

1:07:34.626 --> 1:07:35.000
-Hi.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.000
Uh...

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000
Karen?

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:43.000
Hi.

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000
And Tyler?

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000
Hi. Um...

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000
Wait.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.117
So you lied

1:08:03.157 --> 1:08:05.000
for her because...

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000
you like her.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.980
[laughing] That's...

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:20.197
that's as good a reason

1:08:20.237 --> 1:08:23.000
to lie as any I can think of.

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.082
-[chuckles]

1:08:26.122 --> 1:08:27.000
-[sniffs]

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:28.980
[exhales sharply]

1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:31.000
So...

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000
[clears throat]

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.980
d

1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:40.000
You're gonna see her tonight?

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000
I don't know.

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.980
Who's that man I keep seeing

1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.195
coming out of your room

1:08:55.235 --> 1:08:56.135
in the morning?

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000
Oh, that man.

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000
That man is...

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.980
probably the one thing

1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:18.000
that keeps me going.

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.980
Wow.

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:22.758
-Besides you.

1:09:22.798 --> 1:09:23.980
-[laughs]

1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:24.980
Thanks.

1:09:25.020 --> 1:09:26.457
[Roberta] They all take

1:09:26.497 --> 1:09:28.000
ballroom-dancing classes

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:29.980
on this ship.

1:09:30.020 --> 1:09:31.980
So, when they go to the gala,

1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:32.986
they want to show off

1:09:33.026 --> 1:09:33.980
what they've learned.

1:09:34.020 --> 1:09:35.026
-[Susan] That's so amazing.

1:09:35.066 --> 1:09:35.980
-And they take it very...

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:36.430
-Hi.

1:09:36.470 --> 1:09:36.980
-Hey.

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:37.217
-Hi.

1:09:37.257 --> 1:09:37.980
-How are you?

1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:38.980
What a surprise.

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:40.980
Fine, fine.

1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:41.980
Very breezy day to have...

1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:43.980
Yeah, I love the fog.

1:09:44.020 --> 1:09:44.861
...an intimate

1:09:44.901 --> 1:09:45.980
little discussion.

1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:46.453
You know,

1:09:46.493 --> 1:09:48.233
I've been thinking about you.

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:49.980
Really?

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:51.779
Um, well, uh,

1:09:51.819 --> 1:09:52.312
one of the women

1:09:52.352 --> 1:09:54.000
that I work with, um,

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.556
poisoned her husband,

1:09:56.596 --> 1:09:57.980
who was a batterer,

1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:00.098
um, and guess where

1:10:00.138 --> 1:10:01.980
she got the idea.

1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:02.643
From my first wife,

1:10:02.683 --> 1:10:03.283
of course.

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:04.980
[laughter]

1:10:05.020 --> 1:10:06.980
Or maybe my second wife.

1:10:07.020 --> 1:10:08.980
Oh, my gosh.

1:10:09.020 --> 1:10:09.350
No, no,

1:10:09.390 --> 1:10:11.250
but now I know a lot about you.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:12.500
Yes.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:13.314
-No.

1:10:13.354 --> 1:10:13.980
-No? No.

1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:14.750
From an early

1:10:14.790 --> 1:10:15.980
Agatha Christie book.

1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:16.723
The Murder

1:10:16.763 --> 1:10:17.980
of Roger Ackroyd.

1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:18.651
Exactly.

1:10:18.691 --> 1:10:20.980
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:22.404
Well, I kept that away

1:10:22.444 --> 1:10:22.980
from her.

1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:23.980
[laughter]

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:24.920
And that's why

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:25.980
you still stand.

1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:27.426
So you've been thinking

1:10:27.466 --> 1:10:28.980
about poisoning, but why?

1:10:29.020 --> 1:10:30.980
I mean, just because...

1:10:31.020 --> 1:10:32.261
Oh, no, because I...

1:10:32.301 --> 1:10:34.000
This woman was incarcerated

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.381
for trying to save her child

1:10:36.421 --> 1:10:36.980
and herself.

1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.011
Um, and she didn't

1:10:38.051 --> 1:10:38.980
want to kill him.

1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:40.958
She just wanted to disable him

1:10:40.998 --> 1:10:43.000
so she could stop the violence.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.427
-But he died.

1:10:45.467 --> 1:10:45.980
-Huh.

1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:47.980
I'm so sorry. That's awful.

1:10:48.020 --> 1:10:48.980
Yes, it is awful.

1:10:49.020 --> 1:10:50.008
Do you deal with a lot

1:10:50.048 --> 1:10:50.980
of people who poison?

1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:52.980
I do. Oh, no, no.

1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:54.307
Not so many... I mean,

1:10:54.347 --> 1:10:55.980
they take whatever weapon...

1:10:56.020 --> 1:10:57.319
-Uh-huh.

1:10:57.359 --> 1:10:58.028

1:10:58.068 --> 1:10:59.980
Is in the person's hand

1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:01.980
and, um...

1:11:02.020 --> 1:11:02.349
Can I join you?

1:11:02.389 --> 1:11:02.980
Do you mind if I sit down?

1:11:03.020 --> 1:11:04.219
-Of course, sit down.

1:11:04.259 --> 1:11:04.980
-No, join us.

1:11:05.020 --> 1:11:06.064
I've been fascinated

1:11:06.104 --> 1:11:06.980
by poison lately.

1:11:07.020 --> 1:11:07.190
-Why?

1:11:07.230 --> 1:11:07.980
-Well, I'm thinking

1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:09.980
about writing something

1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:10.798
about someone

1:11:10.838 --> 1:11:11.980
who poisons people.

1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:13.980
I think it's...

1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:16.366
I think, philosophically,

1:11:16.406 --> 1:11:17.980
poisoning is a...

1:11:18.020 --> 1:11:18.843
a very intimate

1:11:18.883 --> 1:11:19.980
way to kill someone,

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:21.980
and it's also very cruel.

1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:32.067

1:14:51.259 --> 1:14:51.980

1:15:17.090 --> 1:15:17.980

1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:19.000
Yeah.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:21.926
I should actually

1:15:21.966 --> 1:15:23.106
say to you, like...

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:27.793
Yeah, I feel like

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:28.980
I should apologize a bit.

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:30.085
I feel bad for dragging you

1:15:30.125 --> 1:15:30.980
into this whole thing.

1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:33.059
I know you didn't want to lie

1:15:33.099 --> 1:15:33.980
to your aunt,

1:15:34.020 --> 1:15:35.336
-and I slightly twisted

1:15:35.376 --> 1:15:35.735
your arm...

1:15:35.775 --> 1:15:35.980
-Mmm.

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.980
...and I feel bad about that,

1:15:38.020 --> 1:15:40.507
and... and she clearly thinks

1:15:40.547 --> 1:15:41.980
so highly of you.

1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:42.543
She loves you.

1:15:42.583 --> 1:15:42.980
She thinks,

1:15:43.020 --> 1:15:44.539
you know, she thinks the world

1:15:44.579 --> 1:15:45.980
of you, and that was obvious

1:15:46.020 --> 1:15:46.980
when I spoke to her today.

1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:49.980
And I think...

1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:50.614
that was probably part

1:15:50.654 --> 1:15:50.980
of the reason

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:51.930
why she was

1:15:51.970 --> 1:15:53.980
so forgiving towards me.

1:15:54.020 --> 1:15:54.384
-Ah.

1:15:54.424 --> 1:15:54.980
-So...

1:15:55.020 --> 1:15:56.980
thank you for...

1:15:57.020 --> 1:15:58.243
Yeah, thanks for everything

And I know I've also,

1:16:02.130 --> 1:16:02.980
like, completely,

1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:04.437
um, inappropriately unloaded

1:16:04.477 --> 1:16:06.277
a whole load of stuff onto you

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:07.412
that I probably

1:16:07.452 --> 1:16:07.980
shouldn't have done,

1:16:08.020 --> 1:16:08.825
-so I'm sorry

1:16:08.865 --> 1:16:09.757
about that, and...

1:16:09.797 --> 1:16:09.980
-Aw.

1:16:15.113 --> 1:16:16.980
that acknowledgement,

1:16:17.020 --> 1:16:20.000
and I...

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.452
It's been... It's so been my

1:16:22.492 --> 1:16:23.980
pleasure getting to know you,

1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:26.099
and I was skeptical

1:16:26.139 --> 1:16:26.980
at first

1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:28.869
about what our relationship

1:16:28.909 --> 1:16:29.980
would look like.

1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:31.903
And I just felt like...

1:16:31.943 --> 1:16:32.980
I don't know.

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:33.647
I just really

1:16:33.687 --> 1:16:34.980
wanted to get to know you,

1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:37.424
and, um, I'm excited

1:16:37.464 --> 1:16:38.414
to hopefully continue

1:16:38.454 --> 1:16:39.980
to get to know you.

1:16:40.020 --> 1:16:41.980
And, uh...

1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:42.883
I don't know,

1:16:42.923 --> 1:16:43.980

what our... what... what, uh...

1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:48.484
our life can look like...

1:16:48.524 --> 1:16:49.980
moving forward.

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000
Maybe, um...

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.939
It's just been probably

1:16:57.979 --> 1:16:59.980
one of the biggest gifts

Uh...

I know this is kind of

1:17:27.463 --> 1:17:29.000
a crazy question, but...

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:32.000
Uh...

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.980

1:17:42.020 --> 1:17:44.319
You're not gonna ask me out,

are you?

made a...

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000
a bit of a fool of myself.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.980
In what way?

1:19:00.020 --> 1:19:02.103
I just... I... I, um, made

1:19:02.143 --> 1:19:03.980
some kind of an advance

1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:05.980
that didn't... That went un...

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:07.980
Oh.

1:19:08.020 --> 1:19:09.980
Unreciprocated.

1:19:10.020 --> 1:19:11.980
[Alice] Mmm-hmm.

1:19:12.020 --> 1:19:14.000
[slurps]

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000
Well, you can't, um...

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000
I hope you don't regret that.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.036
That's... that's...

1:19:24.076 --> 1:19:25.980
The trying is all.

1:19:26.020 --> 1:19:27.980
You know?

1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:28.200
-Hmm.

1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:28.980
-If you don't try,

1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:30.980
if you don't risk...

1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:32.274
Mmm. [chuckles]

1:19:32.314 --> 1:19:34.000
That's good to know.

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.588
I mean, it's, it's, uh,

1:19:38.628 --> 1:19:39.980
you shouldn't be shy

1:19:40.020 --> 1:19:40.980
with this kind of thing,

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:44.369
this... this attraction

1:19:44.409 --> 1:19:45.980
to someone.

1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:47.980
I think attraction is...

1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:49.487
It's the animating force

1:19:49.527 --> 1:19:51.000
in the universe, really.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.077
[exhales sharply]

1:19:53.117 --> 1:19:53.980
That's a fact.

1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:56.000
Well, like...

1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.763
gravity or the pull

1:19:59.803 --> 1:20:00.980
of the poles,

1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:02.091
what pulls

1:20:02.131 --> 1:20:05.000
the monarch butterflies...

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.980
to fly across the world.

1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:10.737
If you feel attracted

1:20:10.777 --> 1:20:12.980
to someone from your heart,

1:20:13.020 --> 1:20:13.695
you know...

1:20:13.735 --> 1:20:14.980
and you look at them

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:15.959
and you feel

1:20:15.999 --> 1:20:18.000
you can see their soul...

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000
that's, uh...

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000
There is...

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:27.731
[chuckles softly] there's no

1:20:27.771 --> 1:20:29.000
bad version of that,

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000
to want to be a part of that.

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.980
And we should...

1:20:37.020 --> 1:20:38.980
Oh, God... treasure it.

1:20:39.020 --> 1:20:40.980
It's, it's, uh...

1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:42.014
We're lucky

1:20:42.054 --> 1:20:43.980
to have that feeling.

1:20:44.020 --> 1:20:45.443
It's the greatest,

1:20:45.483 --> 1:20:47.000
it's the fullest...

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.314
expression of what it is

1:20:49.354 --> 1:20:49.980
to be alive.

1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:50.980
Hmm.

1:20:51.020 --> 1:20:51.531
-So...

1:20:51.571 --> 1:20:52.000
-Wow.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.980
Do you think you'll, you'll...

1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:57.000
How did it end?

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.600
I mean, do you think

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:00.980
you'll try again?

1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.563
-[chuckles] No.

1:21:02.603 --> 1:21:02.980
-No?

1:21:03.020 --> 1:21:03.980
[laughs] No.

1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:06.000
[sniffles] No.

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:09.660
-You know, Suze,

1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:11.520
I... I am convinced...

1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:11.980
-Mmm?

1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:13.980
...she asked me on this trip

1:21:14.020 --> 1:21:15.922
to find out what happened to me

1:21:15.962 --> 1:21:16.980
after my divorce.

1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:19.117
She wants to write about it

1:21:19.157 --> 1:21:20.000
as a sequel

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.980
to her fucking book.

1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:23.718
-I know it.

1:21:23.758 --> 1:21:23.980
-No.

1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:24.718
-I know it.

1:21:24.758 --> 1:21:24.980
-No.

1:21:25.020 --> 1:21:27.540
-You've got to ask her.

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:27.980
-No.

1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:29.257
You have to be direct

1:21:29.297 --> 1:21:29.980
and ask her.

1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:30.561
You know,

1:21:30.601 --> 1:21:31.980
you heard those things

1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:33.980
she said during that talk.

1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:35.486
She uses things

1:21:35.526 --> 1:21:37.980
and people from her life.

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:39.650
Well, I'm... I'm one

1:21:39.690 --> 1:21:40.980
of those people.

1:21:41.020 --> 1:21:42.000
I know you are.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:43.980
But that's what writers do,

1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:45.228
and she never meant

1:21:45.268 --> 1:21:46.980
to hurt you, I promise you.

1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:48.062
-She never meant to hurt you.

1:21:48.102 --> 1:21:48.980
-She doesn't care, Susan.

1:21:49.020 --> 1:21:50.559
I think she does care.

1:21:50.599 --> 1:21:51.980
She cares about you.

1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:53.895
And why would she be writing

1:21:53.935 --> 1:21:54.980
about you again?

1:21:55.020 --> 1:21:55.722
She loves you.

1:21:55.762 --> 1:21:57.202
She's obsessed with you.

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.874
She said she uses people

1:21:59.914 --> 1:22:00.980
from her life,

1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:02.891
and she is going to use me

1:22:02.931 --> 1:22:03.980
in this sequel.

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:05.916
I don't believe that, dear.

1:22:05.956 --> 1:22:06.980
I really don't.

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:09.564
I know it could seem that way

1:22:09.604 --> 1:22:10.980
if you twist it.

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:13.980
If you twist it the other way,

1:22:14.020 --> 1:22:15.283
you know, she has the same

1:22:15.323 --> 1:22:15.980
memories we do

1:22:16.020 --> 1:22:17.980
of our days together.

1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:19.980
They're sacred.

1:22:20.020 --> 1:22:20.233
-Yeah.

1:22:20.273 --> 1:22:20.980
-Maybe not sacred.

1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:23.980
That's a little pompous.

1:22:24.020 --> 1:22:25.942
But you know what I mean,

1:22:25.982 --> 1:22:27.130
what we were talking about

1:22:27.170 --> 1:22:27.980
the other day.

1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:29.980
She has those, too.

1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:30.867
Yeah, but she's

1:22:30.907 --> 1:22:31.980
very different now.

1:22:32.020 --> 1:22:32.738
I know she is.

1:22:32.778 --> 1:22:33.980
She really has changed.

1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:35.680
She's changed so much.

1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:37.980
Did she always talk like that?

1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:38.483
-No.

1:22:38.523 --> 1:22:39.980
-She didn't?

1:22:40.020 --> 1:22:40.980
Did not.

1:22:41.020 --> 1:22:41.735
I wonder why

1:22:41.775 --> 1:22:42.980
she talks like that.

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:45.000
[laughing] I know.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:52.000
[cell phone vibrating]

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.480
[Karen]  Just so you know,

1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:57.980
she's invited me to dinner

1:22:58.020 --> 1:22:59.000
with all of you.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.980
Oh, fuck.

1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:03.980
[Alice] Karen's very hopeful

1:23:04.020 --> 1:23:05.522
about the publishing business,

1:23:05.562 --> 1:23:05.980
actually,

1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:07.962
I mean, against all reason,

1:23:08.002 --> 1:23:09.000
in my opinion,

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.179
but if you could talk

1:23:11.219 --> 1:23:11.980
a little about

1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:13.134
what the agency is going to do

1:23:13.174 --> 1:23:14.494
now and in the future.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.036
-[Karen] Well, yes.

1:23:17.076 --> 1:23:17.548
-The old dead wood

1:23:17.588 --> 1:23:18.980
has been moved aside.

1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:19.906
[Karen] It's been

1:23:19.946 --> 1:23:20.980
an interesting time.

1:23:21.020 --> 1:23:21.927
Um, there have been quite

1:23:21.967 --> 1:23:22.980
a few changes at the agency,

1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:24.980
but I feel very optimistic

1:23:25.020 --> 1:23:25.896
about what we're going

1:23:25.936 --> 1:23:26.980
to be doing going forward,

1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:28.244
and I... We've got

1:23:28.284 --> 1:23:29.980
exciting plans for Alice.

1:23:30.020 --> 1:23:30.936
Um, you know,

1:23:30.976 --> 1:23:32.980
Sonia did tell me that Alice

1:23:33.020 --> 1:23:33.545
was quite secretive

1:23:33.585 --> 1:23:34.485
about her work,

1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:36.815
-um, but I had no idea

1:23:36.855 --> 1:23:37.074
how secretive.

1:23:37.114 --> 1:23:37.980
-[women chuckle]

1:23:38.020 --> 1:23:38.980
Well, I...

1:23:39.020 --> 1:23:40.230
[Karen] I mean, I still haven't

1:23:40.270 --> 1:23:40.980
been able to deduce

1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:42.201
which of your

1:23:42.241 --> 1:23:43.980
literary characters

1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:45.980
that you are reviving.

1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:46.854
-[laughs]

1:23:46.894 --> 1:23:47.570
-I do hope it's Rowena

1:23:47.610 --> 1:23:48.980
from  You Always, You Never.

1:23:49.020 --> 1:23:49.916
Yes, yes,

1:23:49.956 --> 1:23:51.980
I would love to know

1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:53.759
what Rowena has been up to

1:23:53.799 --> 1:23:54.980
the last 35 years.

1:23:55.020 --> 1:23:57.237
Oh, dear, you know...

1:23:57.277 --> 1:23:57.980
[sighs]

1:23:58.020 --> 1:23:58.980
Let me just say,

1:23:59.020 --> 1:24:00.315
-on this subject...

1:24:00.355 --> 1:24:01.980
-I think everyone cares.

1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:03.000
Rowena...

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:04.480
[Alice] I don't think

1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:04.980
anybody really cares.

1:24:05.020 --> 1:24:06.633
What became of Rowena

1:24:06.673 --> 1:24:08.980
after her disastrous marriage?

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:10.460
Did she find love again?

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.980
Did she get another career?

1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:14.980
Did she have a child?

1:24:15.020 --> 1:24:16.485
Rowena is a beloved

1:24:16.525 --> 1:24:17.980
literary character.

1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:18.722
-What, what...

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:19.980
-[Karen] She is. She is.

1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:20.539
-[Alice] Bert, Bert.

1:24:20.579 --> 1:24:20.980
-[Roberta] Yeah.

1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:22.317
[Alice] What I want to say

1:24:22.357 --> 1:24:22.980
about this...

1:24:23.020 --> 1:24:24.985
-[Roberta] Uh-huh.

1:24:25.025 --> 1:24:25.663
-And I... I should

1:24:25.703 --> 1:24:26.980
clarify for you...

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:27.785
-[Roberta] Uh-huh.

1:24:27.825 --> 1:24:28.980
-...that whatever character

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:30.093
I write about,

1:24:30.133 --> 1:24:31.980
is essentially about me.

1:24:32.020 --> 1:24:32.832
I mean, honestly,

1:24:32.872 --> 1:24:33.980
that's what authors do.

1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:34.611
-Don't they?

1:24:34.651 --> 1:24:35.980
-[Susan] Let me... Just...

1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:36.881
-I don't think...

1:24:36.921 --> 1:24:37.980
-And another thing...

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.980
...I have ever been at a table

1:24:41.020 --> 1:24:42.129
with two more

1:24:42.169 --> 1:24:44.000
self-obsessed people.

1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.224
I don't think I ever have.

1:24:46.264 --> 1:24:46.980
This is a first.

1:24:47.020 --> 1:24:49.000
This is a first.

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.361
We care for each other.

1:24:53.401 --> 1:24:53.980
Do we?

1:24:54.020 --> 1:24:55.576
-Do we care for each other?

1:24:55.616 --> 1:24:56.980
-[Alice] Yes, of course.

1:24:57.020 --> 1:24:58.170
[Susan] Yes? Yes.

1:24:58.210 --> 1:24:59.980
We do care for each other.

1:25:00.020 --> 1:25:02.980
This happened in your youth.

1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:04.880
This happened so long...

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:06.000
In your youth.

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.980
And today, this very day,

1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:10.241
we have lived

1:25:10.281 --> 1:25:11.980
most of our lives.

1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:12.980
[Alice clears throat]

1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:14.054
-[Susan] Right?

1:25:14.094 --> 1:25:14.980
-[Alice] Mmm.

1:25:15.020 --> 1:25:18.046
[Susan] Are you gonna continue

1:25:18.086 --> 1:25:19.980
this ancient battle

1:25:20.020 --> 1:25:21.985
for the little time

1:25:22.025 --> 1:25:23.980
that remains to us?

1:25:24.020 --> 1:25:24.803
Do you even know

1:25:24.843 --> 1:25:25.980
what happened yesterday

1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:27.174
when we were out of

1:25:27.214 --> 1:25:28.980
communication with the world.

1:25:29.020 --> 1:25:30.404
Do you know what happened?

1:25:30.444 --> 1:25:31.980
You don't know what happened.

1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:32.895
Do you know what happened?

1:25:32.935 --> 1:25:33.980
Does anyone know what happened?

1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:34.720
[Alice] No. Well,

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:35.980
I was working, so I wasn't...

1:25:36.020 --> 1:25:36.560
[Susan] Well, of course

1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:36.980
you were working.

1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:38.261
-You're always working.

1:25:38.301 --> 1:25:39.081
-[Alice] Yes.

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000
Elon Musk...

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.188
sent many,

1:25:45.228 --> 1:25:47.980
many telecom satellites

1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:50.980
into the sky

1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:53.980
that look exactly like stars,

1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:55.980
exactly like stars.

1:25:56.020 --> 1:25:57.781
So now when humans

1:25:57.821 --> 1:25:59.980
gaze at the night sky,

1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:01.414
they won't know

1:26:01.454 --> 1:26:03.980
if they're gazing at a star

1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:05.684
-or at a machine.

1:26:05.724 --> 1:26:07.000
-[Alice] Hmm.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.980
And we at this table,

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:13.980
at this little table,

1:26:14.020 --> 1:26:16.432
we are among the last,

1:26:16.472 --> 1:26:18.000
the very last,

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.980
ever, ever,

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:24.980
to have seen the actual, real,

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:28.432
the honest, truthful

1:26:28.472 --> 1:26:29.980
night sky

1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:30.980
from the ocean.

1:26:31.020 --> 1:26:34.000
We saw stars...

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000
just stars.

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000
f

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000
[Tyler sighs]

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.480
-Are you packed?

1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:15.000
-I'm killing it.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.980
Yeah?

1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:19.717
-Killing it with the bags?

1:27:19.757 --> 1:27:20.000
-No.

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000
[sighs]

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:27.000
No, my book. Um...

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.980
I deleted it...

1:27:34.020 --> 1:27:35.980
from my computer.

1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:39.000
I deleted it all.

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.302
And I threw the...

1:27:42.342 --> 1:27:42.577
the hard copy

1:27:42.617 --> 1:27:43.980
in the recycling.

1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:44.608
-Why?

1:27:44.648 --> 1:27:45.980
-[chuckles]

1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:48.000
It's...

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:54.000
You know what?

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.399
It's like polishing the vase

1:27:56.439 --> 1:27:58.299
when the house is falling down.

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000
[Tyler] Hmm.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.182
You don't know.

1:28:06.222 --> 1:28:06.980
[chuckles]

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:07.738
You don't know

1:28:07.778 --> 1:28:09.158
what I'm talking about.

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.980
Anyway, I'm gonna...

1:28:13.020 --> 1:28:14.535
ask you to bring

1:28:14.575 --> 1:28:15.980
the bigger bags

1:28:16.020 --> 1:28:18.000
down for me, okay?

1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.000
[mellow jazz music playing]

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:11.000
d

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:40.448
[Alice] I think

1:30:40.488 --> 1:30:40.980
the words matter.

1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:42.861
I do think they matter...

1:30:42.901 --> 1:30:43.980
[clears throat]

1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:45.980
Which ones you choose

1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:47.851
to describe something

1:30:47.891 --> 1:30:49.980
or to express something.

1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:52.487
It takes time to... to, um,

1:30:52.527 --> 1:30:54.980
worry those into existence,

1:30:55.020 --> 1:30:55.984
the right one,

1:30:56.024 --> 1:30:56.980
the right one.

1:30:57.020 --> 1:30:59.980
There's only one that's right.

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:00.431
[exhales]

1:31:00.471 --> 1:31:01.980
I lament... You know, sometimes

1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:03.962
I wait... I wait for a word

1:31:04.002 --> 1:31:04.980
to come to me.

1:31:05.020 --> 1:31:07.176
I wait... I'll wait a week.

1:31:07.216 --> 1:31:07.980
[chuckles]

1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.564
No, but it amused me

1:31:10.604 --> 1:31:11.980
on the ship

1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:13.772
how they were so eager

1:31:13.812 --> 1:31:14.980
that we not use

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:16.274
the word "boat"

1:31:16.314 --> 1:31:17.980
to describe the ship

1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:19.381
because "boat"

1:31:19.421 --> 1:31:21.980
is sort of a diminutive...

1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:23.863
Or when they would say

1:31:23.903 --> 1:31:25.980
don't call it "a cruise."

1:31:26.020 --> 1:31:27.044
It's not a cruise.

1:31:27.084 --> 1:31:27.980
It's a crossing.

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:28.980
[Susan] Mmm.

1:31:29.020 --> 1:31:30.980
Mmm-hmm.

1:31:31.020 --> 1:31:32.980
Mmm-hmm.

1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:34.760
[Alice] And it is a crossing.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.336
It's... You're crossing

1:31:36.376 --> 1:31:36.980
time zones.

1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.233
-You feel them.

1:31:38.273 --> 1:31:39.980
-[Susan] Yes, you do.

1:31:40.020 --> 1:31:40.757
Crossing

1:31:40.797 --> 1:31:42.980
into something unknown.

1:31:43.020 --> 1:31:45.196
I mean, it's... The cruise

1:31:45.236 --> 1:31:46.980
just seems meandering

1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:49.000
and... and silly.

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:54.000
Alice...

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.480
what I'm trying

1:31:57.520 --> 1:31:58.980
to reconcile is

1:31:59.020 --> 1:32:02.000
who is the real you?

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.000
I... I just, uh...

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:09.820
I just don't know

1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:11.980
who you are anymore.

1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:14.420
I mean, does... Does anybody

1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:15.980
trust you anymore?

1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:17.980
And is that hard for you?

1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:19.121
I mean, are...

1:32:19.161 --> 1:32:20.980
are you okay with that?

1:32:21.020 --> 1:32:22.296
You seem to be okay

1:32:22.336 --> 1:32:23.000
with that.

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:26.487
What do you mean?

1:32:26.527 --> 1:32:28.980
Because I write from my life

1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:29.980
and from...

1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:30.514
Oh, yeah,

1:32:30.554 --> 1:32:31.980
you write from your life,

1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:32.980
but you write from others,

1:32:33.020 --> 1:32:35.650
and, and, and those others

1:32:35.690 --> 1:32:37.000
experience it

1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.980
as a kind of betrayal.

1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:42.259
-You obviously...

1:32:42.299 --> 1:32:43.909
-Well, you know, you...

1:32:43.949 --> 1:32:44.449
f

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.980
[whispers] Betrayal.

1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:48.785
I think that

1:32:48.825 --> 1:32:49.980
you perhaps betray

1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:51.127
the people

1:32:51.167 --> 1:32:53.980
that you love the most...

1:32:54.020 --> 1:32:55.050
because you know

1:32:55.090 --> 1:32:56.980
that you have the expectation

1:32:57.020 --> 1:32:58.980
of forgiveness.

1:32:59.020 --> 1:32:59.734
The people

1:32:59.774 --> 1:33:01.980
that you don't know very well,

1:33:02.020 --> 1:33:04.980
trying to seduce or impress,

1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:05.834
you treat them

1:33:05.874 --> 1:33:06.980
much more tenderly.

1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:08.280
That's my experience.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:11.603
Ah. But it's harder

1:33:11.643 --> 1:33:12.980
to forgive

1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:16.980
when you're wallowing

1:33:17.020 --> 1:33:18.910
in the middle of the debris

1:33:18.950 --> 1:33:20.980
of what your life used to be.

1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:24.980
It... It, it requires a greater

1:33:25.020 --> 1:33:26.793
expanse of spirit

1:33:26.833 --> 1:33:30.000
than I think most people have.

1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:32.389
Did you come

1:33:32.429 --> 1:33:35.000
on this trip to, to...

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.043
berate me or to forgive me

1:33:41.083 --> 1:33:42.000
or to...

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.980
extract something else?

1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:48.980
An apology or...

1:33:49.020 --> 1:33:52.980
to reconnect, maybe,

1:33:53.020 --> 1:33:54.980
our friendship?

1:33:55.020 --> 1:33:58.000
Why did you say yes?

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.980
I wanted an apology.

1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:05.697
I wanted you

1:34:05.737 --> 1:34:08.980
to at least acknowledge

1:34:09.020 --> 1:34:09.795
the damage

1:34:09.835 --> 1:34:11.980
that you caused in my life.

1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:14.000
[softly] Oh.

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.980
And...

1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:22.000
And I wanted to extract...

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000
a little compensation for it.

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.980
Because if you

1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:36.023
were going to write

1:34:36.063 --> 1:34:37.000
a sequel,

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000
I would tell you everything

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.980
about the last 35 years.

1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:45.646
I would give you all

1:34:45.686 --> 1:34:47.980
the sordid, squalid details.

1:34:48.020 --> 1:34:49.980
You would have...

1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:53.000
You would have a great book.

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000
And all I want...

1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.980
is 30% of the profits.

1:35:01.020 --> 1:35:02.980
Wait.

1:35:03.020 --> 1:35:04.612
[sputters] What did you...

1:35:04.652 --> 1:35:05.980
What did you just say?

1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:09.000
Well, I think you heard me.

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000
And I think it's fair.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000
Oh, my God.

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:21.355
Oh, my God.

1:35:21.395 --> 1:35:23.000
I just, um...

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.354
I realize what this is about.

1:35:28.394 --> 1:35:29.980
This is not about...

1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:31.593
This is not about love.

1:35:31.633 --> 1:35:33.000
This is about money.

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.095
I'm so sorry.

1:35:35.135 --> 1:35:37.000
I didn't realize that.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:39.980
[groans]

1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:42.000
I'll give you a check.

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.210
We really lost each other,

1:35:50.250 --> 1:35:50.980
you know?

1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:52.000
Yeah, we did.

1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000
I loved you when you were Al.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000
Uh...

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:11.000
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000
d

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000
d

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.637
-Excuse me, Tyler, uh...

1:38:03.677 --> 1:38:03.980
-Hey.

1:38:04.020 --> 1:38:05.292
I'm Dr. Mitchell.

1:38:05.332 --> 1:38:06.980
I'm Alice's physician.

1:38:07.020 --> 1:38:08.980
Come in, please.

1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:09.980
What's happening?

1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:10.504
-Um...

1:38:10.544 --> 1:38:11.980
-Is she sleeping?

1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:12.984
I'm very sorry

1:38:13.024 --> 1:38:13.980
to inform you,

1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:16.389
but your aunt passed away

1:38:16.429 --> 1:38:19.000
in the middle of the night.

1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000
Oh, no.

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:24.980
Alice had a serious

1:38:25.020 --> 1:38:26.160
condition called...

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:27.368
-Fuck.

1:38:27.408 --> 1:38:28.980
-...deep vein thrombosis,

1:38:29.020 --> 1:38:30.691
and it's a blood clot

1:38:30.731 --> 1:38:31.980
which can travel

1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:34.034
-up to the lungs, the heart,

1:38:34.074 --> 1:38:34.607
or the brain.

1:38:34.647 --> 1:38:34.980
-No...

1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:35.605
Right now

1:38:35.645 --> 1:38:36.980
we're not sure which

1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:37.758
until we get

1:38:37.798 --> 1:38:39.000
a coroner's report.

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000
I'm very sorry.

1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:43.980
Um...

1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:46.231
The coroner as well as

1:38:46.271 --> 1:38:48.980
the police are headed here.

1:38:49.020 --> 1:38:49.980
If you'd like some time

1:38:50.020 --> 1:38:50.881
to spend with her

1:38:50.921 --> 1:38:51.980
before they get here.

1:38:52.020 --> 1:38:53.980
Yeah. That would be great.

1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:54.980
Okay, I'll be right outside.

1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:55.800
-Thank you.

1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:56.980
-You're welcome.

1:38:57.020 --> 1:38:59.000
Yeah.

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.000
d

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.843
[Mitchell]  She had told me

1:39:41.883 --> 1:39:43.980
of her wanting to go to England

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.016
to pick up

1:39:45.056 --> 1:39:46.980
the Footling Prize,

1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:49.980
see Blodwyn Pugh's gravesite,

1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:51.841
and also discuss her

1:39:51.881 --> 1:39:53.980
at the awards ceremony.

1:39:54.020 --> 1:39:55.650
She had at one point

1:39:55.690 --> 1:39:56.980
intended to fly.

1:39:57.020 --> 1:39:58.372
Uh, I certainly said that

1:39:58.412 --> 1:39:59.980
that would not be a good idea

1:40:00.020 --> 1:40:01.160
to travel by plane.

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.193
It wouldn't be a good idea

1:40:03.233 --> 1:40:03.980
to travel at all.

1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:05.033
I strongly advised her

1:40:05.073 --> 1:40:05.980
to stay in New York,

1:40:06.020 --> 1:40:08.269
but as you all know,

1:40:08.309 --> 1:40:09.980
Alice is Alice.

1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:11.980
And she's very strong-willed,

1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:12.955
and, ultimately,

1:40:12.995 --> 1:40:14.015
she wanted to go.

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.092
So, I then discussed

1:40:17.132 --> 1:40:17.980
with her perhaps

1:40:18.020 --> 1:40:19.980
I should come along with her

1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:20.695
to help her

1:40:20.735 --> 1:40:21.980
with the medication.

1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:22.382
The medication

1:40:22.422 --> 1:40:22.980
that we typically use

1:40:23.020 --> 1:40:23.931
in this situation

1:40:23.971 --> 1:40:24.980
is a blood thinner,

1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:27.000
but it needed to be injected.

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:28.638
I would give the injections

1:40:28.678 --> 1:40:29.518
in the morning

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:30.980
and in the evening.

1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:31.771
Could I just interrupt

1:40:31.811 --> 1:40:31.980
to ask

1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:33.341
if it could have been

1:40:33.381 --> 1:40:33.980
brought on

1:40:34.020 --> 1:40:37.980
by an emotional discussion,

1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.980
an emotional encounter?

1:40:41.020 --> 1:40:43.980
[Mitchell] Um, most likely not.

1:40:44.020 --> 1:40:46.136
These things are, as I said,

1:40:46.176 --> 1:40:47.980
unpredictable in nature,

1:40:48.020 --> 1:40:49.201
and they can happen

1:40:49.241 --> 1:40:50.980
and it doesn't have anything

1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:52.947
to do with what's going on

1:40:52.987 --> 1:40:54.980
in someone's personal life.

1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:57.000
So, no.

1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.414
[Roberta]  Shall I go

1:41:04.454 --> 1:41:05.980
rebook our flights now?

1:41:06.020 --> 1:41:06.980
[Susan]  Mmm.

1:41:07.020 --> 1:41:08.980
Oh, my goodness sake.

1:41:09.020 --> 1:41:10.980
[Roberta]  Well...

1:41:11.020 --> 1:41:12.149
-[Susan]  We've got to...

1:41:12.189 --> 1:41:12.980
-[Tyler]  To when?

1:41:13.020 --> 1:41:14.431
-[Roberta]  Tomorrow? Uh...

1:41:14.471 --> 1:41:15.980
-[Susan]  Maybe the next day.

1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:17.118
We've got to pack

1:41:17.158 --> 1:41:18.000
Alice's stuff

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.304
-and then pack all our stuff.

1:41:20.344 --> 1:41:21.244
-[Tyler]  Whoa.

1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.009
I don't know.

1:41:25.049 --> 1:41:26.980
I was... I was sort of...

1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:29.499
It doesn't feel right to me

1:41:29.539 --> 1:41:30.980
to, to, to leave

1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:31.907
or to, to, to book

1:41:31.947 --> 1:41:32.980
the flight right now.

1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:34.980
I feel like we got to...

1:41:35.020 --> 1:41:36.980
The trip isn't over.

1:41:37.020 --> 1:41:39.588
Like, the... We should visit

1:41:39.628 --> 1:41:40.980
Blodwyn's grave

1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:43.980
like Alice wanted us to.

1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:46.000
She brought us here.

1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:47.980
She chose us.

1:41:48.020 --> 1:41:50.980
The three... Just us three.

1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:52.980
Personally, for me, I...

1:41:53.020 --> 1:41:56.980
[sputters] My life... I ca...

1:41:57.020 --> 1:41:58.360
Everything that's good

1:41:58.400 --> 1:41:58.980
in my life

1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:00.723
feels related to Alice

1:42:00.763 --> 1:42:01.980
in so many ways.

1:42:02.020 --> 1:42:04.217
I... I've been so ashamed

1:42:04.257 --> 1:42:06.980
of the family that I come from,

1:42:07.020 --> 1:42:08.980
and for so long...

1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:12.000
until I met Alice.

1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:14.980
And...

1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:17.062
I can't leave here without

1:42:17.102 --> 1:42:18.980
going to that gravesite.

1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:19.980
I'm just...

1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:22.790
It would feel like... I'd...

1:42:22.830 --> 1:42:24.980
It would make me sick.

1:43:47.138 --> 1:43:47.980
the woman.

1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:50.000
I don't even like her writing.

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000
This is for Alice.

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:09.000
I guess we should go, then.

1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:11.980
[Susan] Mmm-hmm.

1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:14.000
I need a drink.

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:19.000
[mysterious music playing]

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.080
Isn't there an editor

1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:34.980
or a fellow writer,

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.038
someone who could do

1:44:36.078 --> 1:44:36.980
something with it?

1:44:37.020 --> 1:44:39.980
[Karen]  Honestly, it's...

1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:40.849
I don't know what it is

1:44:40.889 --> 1:44:42.689
or what could be done with it.

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.952
I guess you could call it

1:44:44.992 --> 1:44:45.980
experimental.

1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:47.748
We could post it online

1:44:47.788 --> 1:44:49.980
and charge people to read it.

1:44:50.020 --> 1:44:52.103
I personally wouldn't feel

1:44:52.143 --> 1:44:53.980
comfortable doing that.

1:44:54.020 --> 1:44:55.959
Look, whatever this is,

1:44:55.999 --> 1:44:56.980
it's clearly

1:44:57.020 --> 1:44:58.980
in a very embryonic stage,

1:44:59.020 --> 1:45:00.044
and it's not meant

1:45:00.084 --> 1:45:00.980
to be published.

1:45:01.020 --> 1:45:01.980
She was trying something out,

1:45:02.020 --> 1:45:02.985
and she didn't get

1:45:03.025 --> 1:45:03.980
to see it through.

1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:04.712
Yeah, but people

1:45:04.752 --> 1:45:05.980
might find that interesting.

1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:07.586
Her readers,

1:45:07.626 --> 1:45:09.980
literary scholars.

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:12.582
Look, maybe someone else

1:45:12.622 --> 1:45:13.980
can help you.

1:45:14.020 --> 1:45:14.980
You said she gave it to you.

1:45:15.020 --> 1:45:15.894
You can take it

1:45:15.934 --> 1:45:16.980
wherever you want.

1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:18.727
You don't need me,

1:45:18.767 --> 1:45:19.980
not for that.

1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:20.470
Roberta,

1:45:20.510 --> 1:45:22.010
we need you on the floor.

1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.980
Yeah, I'm coming, Clovis.

1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:26.980
I'll be right there.

1:45:27.020 --> 1:45:28.980
I'm coming.

1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:29.980
Yeah, Mom...

1:45:30.020 --> 1:45:31.980
Should I send it back to you?

1:45:32.020 --> 1:45:33.980
I'm coming. Gah.

1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:34.980
What?

1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:36.980
Uh, no, no, no. Keep it.

1:45:37.020 --> 1:45:38.980
Uh, give it to Tyler.

1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:40.980
Um...

1:45:41.020 --> 1:45:42.980
How about... how about this?

1:45:43.020 --> 1:45:45.000
How about a sequel?

1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:47.679
A sequel with real people,

1:45:47.719 --> 1:45:48.980
real people's names,

1:45:49.020 --> 1:45:51.906
places, about what happened

1:45:51.946 --> 1:45:52.980
in my life

1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:54.770
after the publication

1:45:54.810 --> 1:45:56.980
of  You Always, You Never?

1:45:57.020 --> 1:45:58.980
How about that?

1:45:59.020 --> 1:46:01.257
Roberta, if you were ever

1:46:01.297 --> 1:46:02.980
to write that book,

1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:04.980
I'd love to see it.

1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:06.980
[Susan] I just don't understand

1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:09.191
-the whole agent thing...

1:46:09.231 --> 1:46:09.980
-Mmm-hmm.

1:46:10.020 --> 1:46:11.919
...but, um, I spoke to Karen...

1:46:11.959 --> 1:46:11.980
f

1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:13.850
...and she said that, um...

1:46:13.890 --> 1:46:15.980
because she represents you now,

1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:17.980
she couldn't represent me.

1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:18.712
-No, no, no, no.

1:46:18.752 --> 1:46:19.252
-Yeah.

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.277
-Well, okay, but she can

1:46:21.317 --> 1:46:21.365
find you an--

1:46:21.405 --> 1:46:21.980
-It's a conflict.

1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:24.350
Okay, but she can find you

1:46:24.390 --> 1:46:26.980
an agent and a lawyer, but...

1:46:27.020 --> 1:46:28.195
Look, you should use

1:46:28.235 --> 1:46:28.980
my old agent.

1:46:29.020 --> 1:46:29.732
-That's perfect.

1:46:29.772 --> 1:46:30.815
He'd love to represent you.

1:46:30.855 --> 1:46:30.980
-Oh.

1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:31.189
-Okay.

1:46:31.229 --> 1:46:31.980
-He should be so lucky.

1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:32.382
-Oh.

1:46:32.422 --> 1:46:34.980
-Because the deal's 50-50.

1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:35.405
We're just gonna

1:46:35.445 --> 1:46:36.765
split it 50-50, right?

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:37.555
Well, that doesn't make

1:46:37.595 --> 1:46:37.980
any sense at all.

1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:38.384
-Why?

1:46:38.424 --> 1:46:39.980
-You are the writer.

1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:41.395
-It's not 50-50.

1:46:41.435 --> 1:46:42.980
-Well, yes, it is.

1:46:43.020 --> 1:46:43.232
I mean,

1:46:43.272 --> 1:46:44.532
unless you want more.

1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:45.348
-I mean...

1:46:45.388 --> 1:46:45.980
-Don't be absurd.

1:46:46.020 --> 1:46:47.640
...you don't need an agent.

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.980
[both laughing]

1:46:50.020 --> 1:46:50.980
You're better than your agent.

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.571
Look, I am so happy

1:46:52.611 --> 1:46:53.980
to be doing this.

1:46:54.020 --> 1:46:55.157
This is my idea.

1:46:55.197 --> 1:46:56.980
We're splitting it 50-50.

1:46:57.020 --> 1:46:58.980
That's done. Forget it.

1:46:59.020 --> 1:47:00.529
Let's just move on

1:47:00.569 --> 1:47:01.980
and try to start.

1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:02.980
Do you have some--

1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:04.980
This might be interesting,

1:47:05.020 --> 1:47:06.186
but it turns out

1:47:06.226 --> 1:47:07.980
that the main ingredient

1:47:08.020 --> 1:47:09.201
in antifreeze

1:47:09.241 --> 1:47:10.980
is ethylene glycol.

1:47:11.020 --> 1:47:12.980
In antifreeze?

1:47:13.020 --> 1:47:13.523
In antifreeze.

1:47:13.563 --> 1:47:13.980
Wait, now...

1:47:14.020 --> 1:47:15.530
Which is not only

1:47:15.570 --> 1:47:16.980
incredibly toxic

1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:18.980
but also very sweet.

1:47:19.020 --> 1:47:19.980
Ah.

1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:21.980
So that...

1:47:22.020 --> 1:47:22.832
people, when they

1:47:22.872 --> 1:47:23.980
want to poison someone,

1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:25.980
have used it a lot.

1:47:26.020 --> 1:47:29.033
And now 17 states require

1:47:29.073 --> 1:47:30.980
the manufacturer

1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:32.050
to add something

1:47:32.090 --> 1:47:34.000
to make it taste very bitter.

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:35.980
Mmm-hmm,

1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:37.111
which leaves 33 states

1:47:37.151 --> 1:47:37.980
where they don't.

1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:38.765
-Exactly.

1:47:38.805 --> 1:47:39.980
-If my math...

1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:41.170
So I was thinking

1:47:41.210 --> 1:47:42.980
maybe as part of her plan,

1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:44.946
she either lives in a state

1:47:44.986 --> 1:47:46.980
that doesn't have the law...

1:47:47.020 --> 1:47:47.215
-Okay.

1:47:47.255 --> 1:47:47.980
-...or moves to one.

1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:49.980
And then moves to one.

1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:51.980
And then moves to one.

1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:54.000
[mellow music playing]

1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.980
[Alice]  When I read this novel,

1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:28.000
it's... it's impossible for me

1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:29.732
not to think

1:49:29.772 --> 1:49:30.980
what a miracle it is

1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:32.980
that this universe emerged,

1:49:33.020 --> 1:49:34.980
what a miracle it is

1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:39.980
that consciousness emerged...

1:49:40.020 --> 1:49:42.275
And what a miracle it is

1:49:42.315 --> 1:49:43.980
that Blodwyn Pugh,

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:46.980
her thoughts and experiences,

1:49:47.020 --> 1:49:49.329
that they could

1:49:49.369 --> 1:49:51.980
reach across time

1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:53.143
and reach

1:49:53.183 --> 1:49:56.000
into my consciousness.

1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:58.020
That's a miracle.

1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000
