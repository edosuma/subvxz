00:07.022 --> 00:08.066

00:08.101 --> 00:09.356
Wait, Margot!

00:13.285 --> 00:14.587
There's more things coming.

00:14.617 --> 00:15.908
Maybe you didn't save
the world...

00:15.938 --> 00:18.441
But you might just be able
to save these kids.

00:19.179 --> 00:22.249
Find Amy.
The demon lives within her.

00:22.279 --> 00:23.451
Holyoke told
me and Jessie...

00:23.481 --> 00:24.987
To come save you.
I know.

00:25.519 --> 00:26.656
No!

00:27.454 --> 00:28.686
No!

00:32.787 --> 00:34.655
Aah!
Let go of me!

00:34.685 --> 00:35.931
You know where to go!

00:36.196 --> 00:38.740
I have to get the kids
out of here.

how to get to camp stillwater?

01:08.765 --> 01:10.947
I'm worried
about a friend of mine.

01:11.662 --> 01:13.063
Hop in.

01:22.848 --> 01:25.743
Please, you guys,
let me go.

01:26.452 --> 01:28.843
I didn't mean to hurt him.

01:30.444 --> 01:33.601
Joel, he was...
He was one of us.

01:35.338 --> 01:36.856
Sounds like her.

01:37.490 --> 01:41.226
The demon
is a master of deception.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.114
Open it.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.038
What kind of exorcism
is this?

02:09.169 --> 02:10.596
It's not an exorcism.

02:11.003 --> 02:12.792
It's a purification.

02:13.556 --> 02:17.134
That's the last pure water that
exists from lake stillwater,

02:17.264 --> 02:20.470
and it will save
Amy's soul.

02:21.496 --> 02:23.345
That's why Malphas
chose her.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.910
Because she was pure.

02:26.434 --> 02:30.463
Others have come before,
hoping to summon the demon,

02:30.593 --> 02:33.404
but no vessel has ever been
accepted until hers.

02:33.534 --> 02:39.422
She has made Malphas
more powerful than ever.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.453
And that strength
has left me weakened.

02:42.688 --> 02:45.922
Now I must lead the purification
myself.

02:46.052 --> 02:47.962
Defeating Malphas
is too important.

02:48.092 --> 02:53.194
It will require every bit
of my strength... and yours.

this is how I would say goodbye.

Amy! I told you to keep Ralphie
in his cage.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.287
It's mean to keep him
in a cage, mom.

04:23.317 --> 04:24.755
He wants to be free.

04:24.785 --> 04:27.749

Why don't you ever listen?

04:36.622 --> 04:38.194
What's wrong with you?

04:57.419 --> 04:59.695
You really screwed up, Amy.
It's bad this time.

04:59.725 --> 05:01.264
Did you see dad?
Stop it.

05:01.294 --> 05:03.233
No, I'm serious.
He's pissed.

05:03.263 --> 05:04.767
And I heard him say something
to mom.

05:04.797 --> 05:06.414
I think you should know.
- Go away.

05:06.444 --> 05:08.319
No, really, they don't like
how you can't listen.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.568
They don't want you
anymore.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.226
And they're going to send you
off to live with grandma.

05:13.256 --> 05:15.345
I just want to play
with Ralphie.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.660
What's wrong with that?

05:16.690 --> 05:19.182
Come on, kids. Play nice.

Huh.

05:40.818 --> 05:41.724
Mm.

Oh, yeah, something's stuck
in there.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.609
Oh, no, no, no!
You see what you did?

05:52.639 --> 05:54.521
He's dead,
and it's all your fault!

05:54.551 --> 05:57.407
I just wanted him
to be free.

06:04.612 --> 06:07.840
The water is like bars on a cage
to the demon.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.477
Then why go
through all this?

06:09.507 --> 06:11.698
Why not just bring Amy in there?
Wouldn't that purify her?

06:11.728 --> 06:14.748
It would.
The demon would be killed...

06:14.778 --> 06:16.818
And so would the vessel.

06:16.913 --> 06:18.461

06:18.491 --> 06:20.278
No one, no matter how pure,

to withstand it.

06:21.790 --> 06:22.889
Don't listen to him.

06:22.919 --> 06:25.488
He's the one
who told Joel to kill me.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.815
Prepare yourselves.

Malphas
will try to fight back

06:29.994 --> 06:31.997
in ways
that you cannot imagine.

06:32.027 --> 06:33.418
He will try
every trick in the book

06:33.448 --> 06:34.875
to get you to free him
from his cage.

06:34.905 --> 06:36.775
He's the one trying
to trick you!

06:36.805 --> 06:40.707
The demon cannot get out
of the cage unless you allow it.

06:40.737 --> 06:43.299
Do not open that door,

And how do we do that?

at this lake all these years...

06:59.293 --> 07:01.242
With light.

surrounding us,

hurt you, okay?

18:56.959 --> 18:58.298
What does it want?

18:58.328 --> 18:59.819
I don't know.

19:18.898 --> 19:20.935
What the hell is out there?
I don't know.

19:20.965 --> 19:22.385
Whatever it is, it's
gonna burst in here,

19:22.415 --> 19:23.347
if we don't do something.

19:23.377 --> 19:25.090
We have to save these kids.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.004
They'll be safer here.

19:28.649 --> 19:31.273
I'll try to buy you some time.
Deb, wait.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.227
The second
you get this thing going,

19:33.257 --> 19:35.541
you don't stop no matter what,
promise?

19:35.571 --> 19:37.184
Deb.
Promise.

19:43.418 --> 19:45.115
Close the door behind me.

19:51.144 --> 19:53.394
You're all going to die.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.117
Malphas,
we know your name.

19:55.147 --> 19:57.090
The water washes
your filth away.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.365
Be purified.
Aah!

19:59.655 --> 20:02.489
What's the matter with you, Amy?
Don't you ever listen?

20:04.066 --> 20:05.774
The water
washes your filth away.

20:05.804 --> 20:06.794
Be purified.
Aah!

20:06.824 --> 20:08.560
The water washes
your filth away.

20:08.590 --> 20:10.199
Be purified.

20:11.248 --> 20:13.726
Mom and dad don't want you.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.436
It hurts.
It hurts so much.

20:21.748 --> 20:23.319
She's... she's been through
a lot of pain in her life.

20:23.349 --> 20:24.789
It's all coming out now.

20:29.408 --> 20:30.830
Fight through it, Amy.

20:31.202 --> 20:33.570
You can do it.
You're strong.

20:36.286 --> 20:37.683
Garrett?

20:41.173 --> 20:42.135
Aah!
Amy!

20:42.165 --> 20:44.735
Aah!
Here, here!

20:56.056 --> 20:58.764
I'm impressed
with the number of breakthroughs

20:58.794 --> 21:00.682
that have happened
this week.

21:00.712 --> 21:02.662
It takes a lot of effort

21:02.692 --> 21:06.331
to heal the wounds
that restrict our lives.

21:10.719 --> 21:12.011
Amy?

21:12.648 --> 21:14.105
Haven't heard from you
in awhile.

21:14.135 --> 21:16.611
You must be excited
about your new home?

21:16.641 --> 21:17.910
Home?

21:18.051 --> 21:20.428
I've moved seven times
in the past nine years.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.105
Hunter high
has an exceptional reputation.

21:23.135 --> 21:24.973
Maybe
you'll even meet a friend?

21:25.003 --> 21:26.941
I'm tired
of being the new girl.

21:29.328 --> 21:33.135
You've lost a lot, Amy...
More than most.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.281
But you can move forward.

21:35.311 --> 21:38.379
You can find the home
that you're looking for.

21:40.837 --> 21:42.114
I know it.

21:45.547 --> 21:47.061
The demon
is getting too strong.

21:47.091 --> 21:48.331
We have to call to Amy
again.

21:48.361 --> 21:50.213
I'll read the incantation.

21:54.950 --> 21:57.751
Amy.
Shut your mouth, bitch.

22:02.562 --> 22:05.084
I was cold to you
when you first came here.

22:05.456 --> 22:09.607
I am so sorry if I ever
made you feel unwanted.

22:09.637 --> 22:11.919
I didn't know you then,
but I do now.

22:11.949 --> 22:15.547
<i>"Zohkasa falas mephisto
emorto sacrifuneria."</i>
Aah!

22:18.956 --> 22:21.621
<i>"Malphas
benedictus kandana."</i>

22:30.502 --> 22:33.141
Alex?
Jessie?

22:35.774 --> 22:36.772
Deb?

22:36.802 --> 22:38.012
Yeah. It's me.

22:38.042 --> 22:39.855
The bus... broke down.

22:39.885 --> 22:41.849
The kids are so scared.

22:41.879 --> 22:43.461
Is Amy okay?

22:50.165 --> 22:51.260
What happened?

22:51.290 --> 22:52.977
I think she's back.

22:53.824 --> 22:55.616
We have to get her
some help.

22:55.646 --> 22:57.110
Wait, wait! Jessie, Jessie!

22:57.294 --> 22:59.246
Thanks for opening the door...

22:59.845 --> 23:01.393
Jessie.

23:01.891 --> 23:03.415
Close the door!
It's a trick!

23:04.853 --> 23:06.196
Back!

23:24.147 --> 23:25.423
Now.

23:26.076 --> 23:28.646
Which one of you
is going to open the door?

23:32.396 --> 23:34.164
No volunteers?

23:37.565 --> 23:38.899
Aah!

23:43.489 --> 23:44.867
Jessie!

23:54.897 --> 23:56.329
Come on!

23:59.579 --> 24:00.864
Damn it!

24:04.342 --> 24:06.738
It's okay, kids.
We're gonna get you out of here.

24:09.106 --> 24:10.851
We can do this.
Come on.

24:17.731 --> 24:19.230
Where are you?!

24:26.540 --> 24:27.827
Marvin.

24:38.807 --> 24:40.070
Marvin.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.635
Jessie. Jessie!

25:05.006 --> 25:06.808
Hang on, "braces."

25:07.693 --> 25:10.432
You don't want to leave "townie"
hanging, do you?

25:10.462 --> 25:11.835
Amy, don't do this.

25:11.865 --> 25:13.199
I won't...

25:13.884 --> 25:15.588
If you open the door.

25:16.198 --> 25:17.662
If not...

25:24.797 --> 25:26.293
So...

25:28.006 --> 25:29.555
What's it gonna be?

25:35.755 --> 25:38.634
If you want someone,
take me.

25:42.534 --> 25:44.116
Hey, Dharma bum.

25:47.710 --> 25:48.789
Hey.

25:48.819 --> 25:50.153
Hey.

26:01.790 --> 26:03.460
Amy, don't.

26:04.324 --> 26:05.670
Amy!

26:07.157 --> 26:08.775
<i>We will fight the demon</i>

26:08.805 --> 26:12.732
<i>the way we have always fought
darkness at this lake...</i>

26:12.762 --> 26:15.124
<i>With light.</i>

26:20.668 --> 26:22.053
Malphas.

26:24.232 --> 26:25.956
You want an innocent?

26:26.711 --> 26:28.228
Take me.

26:28.475 --> 26:29.758
I won't fight you.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.200
Let me be your vessel.

26:31.813 --> 26:33.395
And let Amy go.

26:55.329 --> 26:57.138
They're all gonna die.

26:57.604 --> 26:59.465
And it's all
because of you.

27:00.178 --> 27:02.311
Time to face your demons,
kid.

27:02.341 --> 27:03.864
Jessie, don't do it.

27:03.954 --> 27:07.054
I know what it is to have the
light snuffed out inside of you,

27:07.084 --> 27:09.885
to be told the light
in your heart is weakness.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.927
I won't let that happen
to you.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.772
Take me, Malphas.

27:16.137 --> 27:17.522
I welcome you.

27:28.503 --> 27:32.259
You welcomed her here.
Don't you realize that?

27:32.293 --> 27:33.763
You brought her here.

27:33.793 --> 27:36.472
<i>You</i> brought her here...

27:38.139 --> 27:39.837
The perfect vessel.

27:44.354 --> 27:45.710
Help them.

27:47.510 --> 27:48.873
Amy?

27:50.052 --> 27:51.823
Hey, Amy.

27:54.721 --> 27:56.028
Jessie?

27:56.058 --> 27:57.462
Jessie.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.877
Jessie?

28:01.409 --> 28:02.718
Jessie, do...

28:05.040 --> 28:06.225
It.

28:06.255 --> 28:08.847
What? No.
No, no, no, no, no.

28:08.877 --> 28:09.982
It'll kill you.

28:10.012 --> 28:11.391
Do it.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.257
Damn it.

28:25.098 --> 28:26.405
Jessie.

28:33.288 --> 28:35.420
Jessie! Jessie!

28:42.605 --> 28:43.975
Jessie!

29:26.724 --> 29:28.265
What?
Look.

29:29.754 --> 29:31.006
It's over.

29:33.093 --> 29:34.434
It's over, everybody.

29:34.464 --> 29:35.923
We're getting out of here.

29:40.857 --> 29:42.123
What's wrong?

29:43.541 --> 29:44.924
Let's go home.

30:00.779 --> 30:02.024
What...

30:03.015 --> 30:04.553
What happened?

30:06.163 --> 30:07.516
Amy.

30:16.211 --> 30:17.865
Where's Jessie?

30:24.392 --> 30:25.959
Oh, no.

30:29.813 --> 30:31.349
No, no, no.

30:32.329 --> 30:33.466
No.

30:33.496 --> 30:35.189
No, no!

30:49.030 --> 30:52.056
Jessie. Come on.

31:00.225 --> 31:01.716
She's gone.

31:06.897 --> 31:08.670
She did this for me.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.898
She did it
for all of us.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.323
Jessie.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.532
Jessie.

31:22.562 --> 31:23.755
Mm?

31:25.118 --> 31:28.382
Holyoke said that... that no one
could survive the water.

31:28.684 --> 31:31.166
He said no one
was pure enough to survive it.

31:33.702 --> 31:35.015
Until now.

31:43.574 --> 31:45.788
That's twice
you've saved my life.

31:45.818 --> 31:48.541
No one has ever...
Stillwater.

31:48.881 --> 31:50.846
We look out for each other,
right?

31:53.007 --> 31:54.549
Come on.
My car's parked back at camp.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.216
We should catch up to Deb
and the others.

32:02.002 --> 32:03.239
Amy?

32:03.439 --> 32:05.960
No matter what happened here
this summer,

32:06.542 --> 32:09.529
this place
will always feel like home.

32:10.667 --> 32:14.059
Do you mind if I just
have a few minutes alone?

32:14.860 --> 32:16.670
I just want to say
goodbye.

32:17.163 --> 32:18.451
Sure.

32:38.107 --> 32:39.605
Can I help you?

32:41.217 --> 32:42.645
You must be Ms. carpenter.

32:42.675 --> 32:47.274
Yes. I-i am.
And, uh, you are?

32:47.304 --> 32:49.877
Amy. Amy Hughes.

32:50.452 --> 32:52.441
I submitted
an application.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.054
Oh, yes. Of course.

32:55.084 --> 32:56.170
Amy. Hi.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.241
I should've called first.
It's just...

32:58.271 --> 33:00.886
I need to see this place
in person.

33:00.916 --> 33:02.334
It's beautiful.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.078
Yeah.
It always has been.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.409
I was a counselor
here almost 20 years ago,

33:08.439 --> 33:13.019
and, coming back, it feels like
coming home, you know?

33:13.953 --> 33:16.569
I can see
how you'd feel that way.

33:17.714 --> 33:20.661
I've never really felt at home
anywhere, but...

33:21.611 --> 33:22.898
This camp...

33:24.036 --> 33:25.725
I think it could be it.

33:26.151 --> 33:28.470
Oh, Amy, I...

33:28.545 --> 33:31.181
I wish I could help you.
I'm fully...

33:31.616 --> 33:33.107
Staffed.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.643
I'm sorry you drove
all the way up here.

33:34.673 --> 33:36.018
Please, I...

33:36.681 --> 33:37.719
I need a fresh start.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.551
I'm sorry.
I wish that I could help you.

33:39.581 --> 33:41.926
I-i just don't have
the space.

33:41.956 --> 33:44.672
If one of the counselors drops
out, you'll be my first call.

33:44.702 --> 33:46.021
I promise.

33:48.510 --> 33:49.578
Hey, what did you decide
about camp?

33:49.608 --> 33:51.447
You got to get
your application in.

33:51.477 --> 33:52.810
I'm going.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.586
Really?

33:57.494 --> 34:00.873
For the same reason
we're sneaking out
to that party tonight.

34:00.903 --> 34:03.378
Sometimes you have to do things
that scare you, right?

34:03.408 --> 34:06.035
[ Rob base and dj e-z rock's
"get on the dance floor" plays ]

34:06.065 --> 34:07.626
Whoo!

34:10.061 --> 34:12.081
All right, everybody.
Just calm down.

34:12.112 --> 34:13.386
Move!

34:15.451 --> 34:16.456
Hey, where you going?

34:16.485 --> 34:18.417
If they catch us, that's it.
I have to get out of here!

34:18.447 --> 34:20.065
It's gonna be all right.
Hey, kid! Open the door!

34:20.094 --> 34:21.811
Amy, no, it won't.
Margot, what are you doing?

34:21.841 --> 34:23.467
Wait, Margot!

34:24.245 --> 34:25.946
Margot!
Margot!

34:25.976 --> 34:27.181
Amy!

34:28.466 --> 34:30.404
Amy, pull me up.

34:30.434 --> 34:31.748
Amy!

34:33.387 --> 34:36.835
I'm sorry it had to be this way.
I called the cops.

34:36.864 --> 34:38.995
I didn't have a choice.
It was the only way.

34:39.025 --> 34:40.226
Amy, what are you...

34:40.255 --> 34:42.121
Camp stillwater,
you were right.

34:42.150 --> 34:44.549
It's <i>exactly</i>
what I've been looking for.

34:44.579 --> 34:48.636
Unfortunately,
there is only room...

34:48.666 --> 34:49.907
For me.

34:49.937 --> 34:51.349
Amy!

34:53.512 --> 34:54.850
Aah!

35:08.636 --> 35:10.607
She went out the window.

35:13.455 --> 35:16.554
I tried to save her!
I tried, but... oh, God.

35:16.584 --> 35:17.728
She's dead.

35:18.387 --> 35:19.684
She's dead.

35:27.782 --> 35:31.243
<i>You brought her here,
the perfect vessel.</i>

36:01.677 --> 36:03.237
Are you the camp director?

36:03.578 --> 36:04.689
Who are you?

36:04.719 --> 36:05.843
I'm looking
for Amy Hughes.

36:05.873 --> 36:08.180
She's not
who she says she is.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.390
How do you like these Jordaches
now, bitch?

36:35.088 --> 36:36.450
Deb?

36:39.510 --> 36:42.287
Can you believe
they tried to purify me?

36:42.401 --> 36:47.285
Some people are so stupid.

36:50.823 --> 36:52.592
Malphas...

36:52.901 --> 36:54.855
Come back to me.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.055
Malphas is the only one
who ever understood me.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.603
Everybody else...

37:05.234 --> 37:06.638
My family...

37:08.113 --> 37:10.084
They just kept me caged,

37:11.772 --> 37:13.564
which is why I killed them.

37:14.959 --> 37:17.217
Malphas
never wanted an innocent.

37:17.247 --> 37:19.957
He wanted someone
just like me.

37:27.016 --> 37:30.935
It's like I told you
the first time I came here, Deb.

37:31.065 --> 37:32.823
I've spent my life

37:33.256 --> 37:37.922
looking for a place
where I am free to be me,

37:38.096 --> 37:39.472
the <i>real</i> me.

37:40.672 --> 37:43.824
This is where
i was meant to be.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.005
I closed this camp,

37:51.035 --> 37:53.823
and it will <i>never</i> reopen.

37:53.853 --> 37:55.986
I saved the kids.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.166
Ahh!

38:09.079 --> 38:11.430
But you didn't
save yourself.

38:27.647 --> 38:29.374
Do you remember now,

38:29.415 --> 38:32.258
the real reason
why you came back here?

38:34.190 --> 38:36.220
You're not so innocent,
either.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.857
Thank you
for bringing me home, Deb.

38:38.887 --> 38:39.842
Oh, my God.

38:39.872 --> 38:41.617

"home sweet home" plays ]

39:25.897 --> 39:27.306
Oh, my God.

40:07.470 --> 40:09.071
Amy, you coming?

40:17.787 --> 40:19.562
Be right there!
