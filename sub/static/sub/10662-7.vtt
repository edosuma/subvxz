00:00.074 --> 00:03.144
<i>The Carmichael Show</i> is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.145 --> 00:04.911
(cell phone ringing)

00:06.782 --> 00:08.424
Who was that?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.126
Didn't recognize the number.

00:10.127 --> 00:13.282
If it's an emergency, they'll,
like, leave a frantic voice mail

00:13.283 --> 00:16.699
telling me who died
and what the next steps are.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.768
Well, did they leave a voice mail?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.469
Yeah, no. No voice mail.

00:20.470 --> 00:23.606
How can you just sit there,
like, not knowing who called?

00:23.607 --> 00:25.683
Doesn't it drive you crazy?
It drives me crazy.

00:25.684 --> 00:26.743
You know what? We should call them back

00:26.744 --> 00:28.088
and we should find out who it is.

00:28.089 --> 00:28.845
It'll be exciting.

00:28.846 --> 00:31.919
I-I don't answer the calls
that I don't recognize

00:31.920 --> 00:33.024
'cause it could be anybody.

00:33.025 --> 00:34.229
It could be Bank of America

00:34.230 --> 00:36.053
calling, asking for all
that money I owe them.

00:36.054 --> 00:39.534
Or, like, it may be, like,
this scorned woman from my past

00:39.535 --> 00:42.937
that's calling, trying to seek revenge.

00:42.938 --> 00:45.473
How many scorned women
from your past want revenge?

00:45.474 --> 00:48.543
And how much debt are you in?

00:48.544 --> 00:50.812
Both are high numbers, Maxine.

00:50.813 --> 00:52.580
(phone ringing)

00:52.581 --> 00:53.648
Oh.

00:53.649 --> 00:55.116
Hello.

00:55.117 --> 00:56.718
What?

00:56.719 --> 00:58.820
Are you kidding me? Yeah, no.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.321
Come over now.

01:00.322 --> 01:03.391
Yeah, 1311 Sycamore Ave, apartment 4-B.

01:03.392 --> 01:04.959
Perfect.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.561
All right. I'll see you soon. Peace.

01:06.562 --> 01:07.562
Who was that?

01:07.563 --> 01:09.063
That's my friend Shawn.

01:09.064 --> 01:11.926
He just got out of prison.
He's on his way over here now.

01:15.704 --> 01:18.606
Wait. How-How long was he in prison for?

01:18.607 --> 01:19.841
Oh, ten years.

01:19.842 --> 01:21.242
Damn...

01:21.243 --> 01:23.578
I am so excited to see Shawn.

01:23.579 --> 01:24.879
Wait, ten years?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.381
Yeah, and, uh...

01:26.382 --> 01:28.716
Wait, as your boyfriend, Maxine...

01:28.717 --> 01:30.185
and I never thought I'd says this...

01:30.186 --> 01:32.720
but maybe you should
change into something

01:32.721 --> 01:34.088
less attractive, you know?

01:34.089 --> 01:35.752
I love Shawn, he's one
of my best friends,

01:35.753 --> 01:37.659
but he's been in prison
for, like, ten years,

01:37.660 --> 01:40.261
and right now, your legs
look like the Golden Arches.

01:40.262 --> 01:41.329
You know what I mean?

01:41.330 --> 01:43.097
- It's just...
- Okay.

01:43.098 --> 01:44.766
Should I be concerned?

01:44.767 --> 01:46.134
No, don't be concerned at all.

01:46.135 --> 01:48.198
Shawn is great and you're
going to love him, really.

01:48.199 --> 01:50.805
But... if at some point
during the conversation,

01:50.806 --> 01:52.473
you want to slip in this lie

01:52.474 --> 01:54.541
about how you have herpes,
it couldn't hurt.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.612
Shawn's coming over.

02:06.468 --> 02:13.068
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com</b>.

02:16.648 --> 02:18.717
Jerrod, we heard.

02:18.718 --> 02:20.952
Your convict friend is free.

02:22.989 --> 02:25.624
We came over to say
the man is a monster,

02:25.625 --> 02:27.192
a menace to society

02:27.193 --> 02:30.596
and all those other movies that
I can't think of the name now.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.464
<i>Boyz n the Hood.</i>

02:32.465 --> 02:34.133
Yeah, that one, too.

02:34.134 --> 02:36.201
We hope you are not considering

02:36.202 --> 02:38.871
bringing this man back into our lives.

02:38.872 --> 02:40.672
Yeah, what she said.

02:40.673 --> 02:41.840
Hey, Maxine.

02:41.841 --> 02:43.542
So, wait, let me get this straight.

02:43.543 --> 02:44.967
You guys came all the way over here

02:44.968 --> 02:45.911
just to yell at me?

02:45.912 --> 02:48.135
Well, your mama insisted on
yelling at you to your face.

02:48.136 --> 02:49.581
I wanted IHOP, but I thought,

02:49.582 --> 02:51.565
well, y'all probably got
breakfast over here, too.

02:51.566 --> 02:53.252
We could just kill

02:53.253 --> 02:54.920
two birds with one stone.

02:54.921 --> 02:56.321
I'll have a waffle.

02:56.322 --> 02:57.823
I'm not sexist, so I'm fine

02:57.824 --> 03:00.458
with either one of you
preparing it for me.

03:02.028 --> 03:04.029
Don't say those things about Shawn.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.365
He's a nice guy, he just
got into some trouble.

03:06.366 --> 03:08.734
He stole out of the collection plate.

03:08.735 --> 03:11.502
He was getting change.

03:13.173 --> 03:14.740
He stole our car, son.

03:14.741 --> 03:16.542
He borrowed your car without asking.

03:16.543 --> 03:18.944
He brought it back.

03:18.945 --> 03:20.768
Jerrod, he was always
coming over to the house

03:20.769 --> 03:22.414
smelling like weed.

03:22.415 --> 03:25.616
He gave me a contact high, I think.

03:26.853 --> 03:29.154
It was relaxing...

03:29.155 --> 03:31.589
but I'm still mad at him about it.

03:32.692 --> 03:34.259
You guys, I'm sure that he has gotten

03:34.260 --> 03:35.794
a chance to do some growing up.

03:35.795 --> 03:36.995
I mean, it's been ten years.

03:36.996 --> 03:38.030
Yeah, exactly.

03:38.031 --> 03:39.464
Ten years in prison.

03:39.465 --> 03:42.568
You don't spend ten years in the
most violent place on earth

03:42.569 --> 03:46.238
and magically reappear less violent.

03:46.239 --> 03:48.307
Shawn's not violent,
he's a drug dealer.

03:48.308 --> 03:49.741
He's basically Gandhi

03:49.742 --> 03:52.211
if Gandhi sold cocaine
within a school zone.

03:52.212 --> 03:53.512
And don't say things

03:53.513 --> 03:54.613
like that about Shawn.

03:54.614 --> 03:56.055
You're going to get in Maxine's head

03:56.056 --> 03:57.423
and she's going to have
these preconceived notions

03:57.424 --> 03:59.318
of who he is before he even gets here.

03:59.319 --> 04:00.719
He's coming over here?

04:00.720 --> 04:03.055
Well, if he's coming here, honey,

04:03.056 --> 04:05.691
I'm going to go hide
all of your valuables.

04:05.692 --> 04:09.094
This here painting, how
much y'all pay for that?

04:09.095 --> 04:10.462
The one with the umbrella.

04:10.463 --> 04:11.363
Ma!

04:11.364 --> 04:13.365
It's going in the closet.

04:13.366 --> 04:16.401
Why are you guys going
crazy over Shawn?

04:16.402 --> 04:18.170
It's Shawn. You know Shawn.

04:18.171 --> 04:19.612
You've known him since we were kids.

04:19.613 --> 04:21.076
Yeah, and I knew since you were kids

04:21.077 --> 04:22.741
he was going to be a drug dealer.

04:22.742 --> 04:27.212
You could see it in his eyes.
He had them cocaine eyes.

04:27.213 --> 04:31.149
We used to pray for Shawn
to turn his life around

04:31.150 --> 04:35.287
and become a productive
member of society.

04:35.288 --> 04:37.189
But that didn't happen.

04:37.190 --> 04:40.726
So now I'm focusing all my prayers

04:40.727 --> 04:45.831
on those people in Flint
drinking that gasoline water.

04:45.832 --> 04:47.511
JOE: You know, when Mexico's

04:47.512 --> 04:48.616
got cleaner water than you,

04:48.617 --> 04:51.084
you know it's time to move.

04:52.279 --> 04:53.345
Okay, you guys, come on.

04:53.346 --> 04:54.680
Jerrod seems to trust the guy.

04:54.681 --> 04:55.881
We should give him a chance.

04:55.882 --> 04:56.949
I mean, especially at a time

04:56.950 --> 04:58.231
where he needs support and to be

04:58.232 --> 04:59.615
surrounded by people who love him.

04:59.616 --> 05:01.135
Well, that's not us.

05:01.755 --> 05:03.189
Why is he out so soon?

05:03.190 --> 05:05.491
I thought he got 13 years.

05:05.492 --> 05:07.093
He got out early for good behavior.

05:07.094 --> 05:08.661
Good behavior in prison?

05:08.662 --> 05:11.263
That's like when you don't
shank somebody in the shower.

05:11.264 --> 05:13.099
Now, good behavior for normal people,

05:13.100 --> 05:15.401
that's like, say, you give a
homeless man five dollars.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.502
You ever done that?

05:16.503 --> 05:19.071
I gave a homeless man
five dollars once.

05:19.072 --> 05:21.472
It was an accident,
but it still felt good.

05:22.876 --> 05:25.111
CYNTHIA: Maxine,

05:25.112 --> 05:27.580
why are you letting a
convict into your house?

05:27.581 --> 05:31.283
Especially wearing that outfit.

05:31.284 --> 05:33.185
I'm not saying you asking for it,

05:33.186 --> 05:36.254
but you not <i>not</i> asking for it.

05:37.724 --> 05:39.267
He's going to find out where you live.

05:39.268 --> 05:40.359
Where you sleep.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.128
Where you think you're safe.

05:42.129 --> 05:44.797
But you not gon' be,
'cause he's watching.

05:44.798 --> 05:46.565
Always watching.

05:46.566 --> 05:47.733
Okay, relax, everybody.

05:47.734 --> 05:49.135
It's Shawn we're talking about.

05:49.136 --> 05:51.604
Not the woman that killed
Selena, all right?

05:51.605 --> 05:53.439
He's a good guy, and he's my friend.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.041
And just because he went to
prison doesn't change anything.

05:56.042 --> 06:00.112
When he returns and gets here,
he'll still be my friend.

06:00.113 --> 06:01.879
(knocking)

06:03.850 --> 06:04.717
My man!

06:04.718 --> 06:06.719
Ah! What's happening?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.287
Jerrod, what's up, baby?

06:08.288 --> 06:09.788
Damn, you grew up on me.

06:09.789 --> 06:12.725
You got a little taller, but you
still ain't gained no weight.

06:12.726 --> 06:14.527
Yeah, man. You look good, man.

06:14.528 --> 06:16.262
Like, you got no visible gashes.

06:16.263 --> 06:17.963
No neck tattoos.

06:17.964 --> 06:20.232
You might be able
to get a job at a bank.

06:20.233 --> 06:22.301
MAXINE: Well, hello.

06:22.302 --> 06:24.537
Welcome. I'm Maxine. Nice to meet you.

06:24.538 --> 06:26.639
- Damn. She's fine.
- Right?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.908
Yeah. I mean, she's, like, a ten, brah.

06:28.909 --> 06:31.577
- Yeah.
- And not just by prison standards.

06:31.578 --> 06:33.012
Well, thank you.

06:33.013 --> 06:36.214
Oh, stop it. She look all right.

06:37.551 --> 06:39.652
How you doing, Mrs. Carmichael?

06:39.653 --> 06:41.320
Shawn, you're not gonna charm me.

06:41.321 --> 06:44.590
I already know I'm fine.

06:44.591 --> 06:45.958
Mr. Carmichael.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.426
Yep.

06:47.427 --> 06:48.627
Shawn,

06:48.628 --> 06:50.529
talk to me, man...
where are you staying?

06:50.530 --> 06:52.498
Well, right now they got
me at this halfway house.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.500
You know, everybody in there
look like a Batman villain,

06:54.501 --> 06:56.202
but, you know, I'm gonna make it work

06:56.203 --> 06:57.970
until I could find something better.

06:57.971 --> 06:59.705
Don't... You can't stay
at a halfway house.

06:59.706 --> 07:02.274
You know what? Just stay here
with us for a couple of days.

07:02.275 --> 07:05.311
Now, look at that. There it is.

07:05.312 --> 07:06.655
He hasn't been here five minutes,

07:06.656 --> 07:09.157
and he already wormed his
way into a place to stay.

07:10.383 --> 07:12.751
Jerrod, don't let him charm you.

07:12.752 --> 07:14.455
Look, Cynthia, he just
got out of prison...

07:14.456 --> 07:16.956
don't you think he deserves a
couple of nights in a nice place?

07:16.957 --> 07:18.891
I mean, have you ever
been in a halfway house?

07:18.892 --> 07:21.759
Do I look like I ever
been in a halfway house?!

07:22.962 --> 07:24.763
Well, they're overcrowded,
there's no privacy,

07:24.764 --> 07:27.032
no sense of safety or well-being.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.734
It's no better than jail.

07:28.735 --> 07:30.869
Look, I promise y'all I'm
not looking for nothin'.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.972
I just wanted to reconnect
with my man Jerrod,

07:32.973 --> 07:35.074
meet Maxine, and just
pick up where I left off.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.842
You know, I'm glad you guys are here,

07:36.843 --> 07:38.377
'cause I just want to say thank you.

07:38.378 --> 07:40.012
All you ever did was try to show me

07:40.013 --> 07:41.814
what a God-fearing,
stable house looks like,

07:41.815 --> 07:44.083
when nobody else took
the time out for me.

07:44.084 --> 07:45.774
That's nice, man. And you don't have

07:45.775 --> 07:46.752
to explain yourself to them.

07:46.753 --> 07:48.496
I'm happy you're here,
and you can stay here

07:48.497 --> 07:49.455
as long as you need to.

07:49.456 --> 07:50.489
You sure? I mean,

07:50.490 --> 07:51.624
you ain't got to do this.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.392
And you shouldn't.

07:53.393 --> 07:55.694
Hey, man, I'm really happy you're here.

07:55.695 --> 07:58.441
In fact, hey, Maxine, is
it cool if I hang out

07:58.442 --> 08:00.545
with Shawn for a bit?
You want to get some breakfast?

08:00.546 --> 08:03.013
Yeah, man. I been dreaming
about IHOP for ten years.

08:03.503 --> 08:05.970
Hmm.

08:08.741 --> 08:10.724
Well, we came to yell at
Jerrod; he didn't listen.

08:10.725 --> 08:11.343
Mm-hmm.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.612
I wanted breakfast;
they ended up getting IHOP.

08:13.613 --> 08:16.515
Cynthia, I don't think we
killed <i> any</i> birds on this visit.

08:16.516 --> 08:17.883
Well...

08:17.884 --> 08:20.853
Maxine, you can't say
we didn't warn you.

08:20.854 --> 08:22.688
That Shawn is bad news.

08:22.689 --> 08:26.225
Mm-hmm. Jerrod has always been
too blind to see Shawn's faults.

08:26.226 --> 08:27.459
Look, Jerrod is an adult now.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.328
I trust him to make good decisions.

08:29.329 --> 08:31.930
Look, I promised myself a
waffle on the way over here.

08:31.931 --> 08:34.866
Now, if you get the waffle iron,
the batter, make the waffle,

08:34.868 --> 08:37.301
I can do the rest.

08:40.361 --> 08:41.662
(both laughing)

08:43.154 --> 08:44.487
Oh...

08:44.488 --> 08:46.823
(slurring): You... Okay, okay, all right.

08:46.824 --> 08:48.792
- All right, you good?
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:48.793 --> 08:51.161
Here's what we're gonna do...
we're gonna go in here,

08:51.162 --> 08:53.063
we're not gonna look
like we been drinking,

08:53.064 --> 08:55.665
at all, we're not gonna act
like we've been drinking...

08:55.666 --> 08:56.867
Your girl don't let you drink?

08:56.868 --> 08:58.201
She does, but...

08:58.202 --> 09:00.070
we left at breakfast time,

09:00.071 --> 09:02.272
and it's almost breakfast time again,

09:02.273 --> 09:04.807
and so she might be a little concerned.

09:09.514 --> 09:11.214
Jerrod, I'm a little concerned.

09:11.215 --> 09:13.315
(sputters)

09:14.886 --> 09:16.218
Hey, boo.

09:17.555 --> 09:19.723
I'm so sorry we came in so late.

09:19.724 --> 09:22.392
But... I stopped by the taco truck

09:22.393 --> 09:23.960
and got you a burrito!

09:23.961 --> 09:26.229
Who's the best boyfriend ever!

09:26.230 --> 09:27.564
What...

09:27.565 --> 09:30.599
Is that blood on this bag?

09:31.436 --> 09:32.903
Yes.

09:32.904 --> 09:34.704
But it's not mine.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.807
Jerrod, what happened tonight?

09:36.808 --> 09:38.475
(exhales) Nothing much.

09:38.476 --> 09:40.944
I mean, Shawn got in a little scuffle.

09:40.945 --> 09:42.288
MAXINE: A scuffle? Like, a fight?

09:42.289 --> 09:43.914
No, no, not, like, a fight.

09:43.915 --> 09:46.383
Like, a little dust-up.

09:46.384 --> 09:47.884
That also means fight.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.987
No, like, a...
like, a scrum, if you will.

09:50.988 --> 09:54.691
Okay, well, Shawn can get
arrested for a scuffle,

09:54.692 --> 09:56.973
- and then he'll go right back to prison.
- SHAWN: Maxine,

09:56.997 --> 09:59.341
- don't be mad at Jerrod.
- Yeah, don't be mad at Jerrod.

09:59.342 --> 10:01.023
- It was my fault.
- MAXINE: Yeah.

10:01.024 --> 10:03.426
I know. You got in a fight
your first night out of prison.

10:03.427 --> 10:04.827
I'm pretty sure it's your fault.

10:04.828 --> 10:06.796
Well, don't be mad at <i> Shawn.</i>

10:06.797 --> 10:08.064
I mean, he was

10:08.065 --> 10:09.966
a hero tonight.
You should've seen what...

10:09.967 --> 10:11.300
So, this is what happened.

10:11.301 --> 10:13.469
So, we were just at the
bar, we're having fun,

10:13.470 --> 10:15.471
we're having a great time,
and then this man

10:15.472 --> 10:18.808
who was incredibly rude just came out

10:18.809 --> 10:20.576
and he stepped on my Jordans.

10:20.577 --> 10:21.777
These!

10:21.778 --> 10:24.013
Like, my first thought
when he did it was like,

10:24.014 --> 10:27.549
"Man. I really want to punch
this man in the face."

10:28.485 --> 10:30.419
- But I didn't do it.
- He didn't.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.054
- I did not do it, right?
- Nope.

10:32.055 --> 10:34.557
I didn't do it. Well, let me
tell you what happened next.

10:34.558 --> 10:35.925
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I know what happened.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.493
You don't know what happened,
Max. You weren't there.

10:37.494 --> 10:38.895
You weren't there, Max.

10:38.896 --> 10:41.119
- Are you ready? Are you excited?
- I know what... Okay.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.260
Don't get ahead of the story.
You're gonna spoil it.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.102
Shawn punched the man in the face.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.737
Didn't you do it?

10:47.738 --> 10:49.241
- Didn't you do it though?
- I did it.

10:49.242 --> 10:50.640
He did it. He really did it.

10:50.641 --> 10:52.241
SHAWN: Can I go wash

10:52.242 --> 10:53.476
- the blood off my hands?
- Yeah,

10:53.477 --> 10:54.443
- you go do that right now.
- Thank you.

10:54.444 --> 10:55.587
That's actually a good idea.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.722
You got to wash the evidence off.

10:59.483 --> 11:01.417
Jerrod, Shawn

11:01.418 --> 11:03.386
is supposed to be making
a new life for himself.

11:03.387 --> 11:06.455
And staying out and getting
drunk isn't helping.

11:06.456 --> 11:08.591
Well, I mean,
Shawn just got out of prison,

11:08.592 --> 11:10.193
like, a day ago, Maxine.

11:10.194 --> 11:11.875
Okay, look, I don't
know Shawn like you do,

11:11.876 --> 11:13.499
but what he does in
these first two weeks

11:13.500 --> 11:15.164
is critical to his success.

11:15.165 --> 11:17.767
What he does is critical to his success.

11:17.768 --> 11:19.901
Okay, I got it.

11:20.704 --> 11:22.837
(sighs)

11:24.608 --> 11:27.543
Hey, Maxine.

11:27.544 --> 11:29.512
- Maxine.
- Hmm?

11:29.513 --> 11:32.315
- Ma-Maxine.
- What?

11:32.316 --> 11:35.251
(burps)

11:35.252 --> 11:37.719
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

11:40.490 --> 11:42.758
Good morning.

11:42.759 --> 11:45.027
You guys partied pretty
hard last night.

11:45.028 --> 11:46.996
Jerrod's still passed out.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.465
I don't think I've ever
seen him that drunk before.

11:49.466 --> 11:50.833
Hey, Maxine.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.169
You think you could give me a ride?

11:53.170 --> 11:55.871
Uh, yeah, I'm sure once Jerrod gets up.

11:55.872 --> 11:58.407
Come on, Maxine,
you can't give me a ride?

11:58.408 --> 12:00.376
It's work-related.

12:00.377 --> 12:02.878
It's this girl. She said she
might have some business for me.

12:02.879 --> 12:06.082
- Um...
- Come on, Maxine.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.324
What about all that stuff you
was sayin' about me needing

12:08.325 --> 12:10.392
to get out there and get
started on the right foot?

12:10.393 --> 12:13.189
Hmm? You ain't gonna
help me get some work?

12:13.190 --> 12:15.992
Okay. Yeah, fine.

12:15.993 --> 12:19.428
I think I'm having a herpes flare-up,

12:19.429 --> 12:21.563
so...

12:28.872 --> 12:31.874
...I'm just gonna, um,
go get my herpes medicine

12:31.875 --> 12:34.810
and then, uh, we can... we can go.

12:34.811 --> 12:36.478
I-I have herpes.

12:40.884 --> 12:43.386
So no one was gonna tell Nekeisha

12:43.387 --> 12:45.054
that Shawn was out of jail?

12:45.055 --> 12:47.490
I mean, I would've tried to
sleep with him already, but...

12:47.491 --> 12:49.625
(chuckles) Okay, Nekeisha,

12:49.626 --> 12:51.427
look, you're not gonna come
over to my parents' house,

12:51.428 --> 12:52.728
using their washing machine,

12:52.729 --> 12:54.830
talking about sleeping with
somebody I grew up with.

12:54.831 --> 12:56.574
Okay, you're only gonna
take advantage of me

12:56.575 --> 12:59.035
one way at a time.

12:59.036 --> 13:01.219
Bobby, there's something
that you got to realize, okay?

13:01.220 --> 13:03.205
During the course of this
divorce, eventually,

13:03.206 --> 13:04.949
we're gonna sleep with
each other's friends.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.809
I mean, Charlotte is a growing city,

13:06.810 --> 13:08.244
but it's still a small town.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.645
That's not fair at all.

13:09.646 --> 13:14.050
Because all your friends are
dudes you used to sleep with.

13:14.051 --> 13:17.520
How is that fair to me? I don't
want to sleep with other dudes.

13:17.521 --> 13:19.955
So it's my fault that I know
how to maintain relationships?

13:19.956 --> 13:22.325
I'm not playing the blame
game with you, Bobby.

13:22.326 --> 13:25.127
- I'm not the one, okay?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:25.128 --> 13:27.096
Have either of you seen Maxine?

13:27.097 --> 13:29.365
No, I haven't seen her.
But if I do, I'll let you know.

13:29.366 --> 13:31.634
She will. She'll
definitely let you know.

13:31.635 --> 13:34.003
- That's what she's good at.
- Mm-hmm.

13:34.004 --> 13:36.504
'Cause I'm a very
informational type of bitch.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.845
Ma, Dad, have y'all seen
or talked to Maxine?

13:42.846 --> 13:45.109
She left this note saying she
was taking Shawn somewhere,

13:45.110 --> 13:46.949
but neither of 'em are
answering their phones.

13:46.950 --> 13:50.052
Uh-oh. Here we go.

13:50.053 --> 13:52.221
Wait a minute, you think
Maxine is cheating on you?

13:52.222 --> 13:54.824
Ooh. Or worse,

13:54.825 --> 13:57.093
she dead in a ditch somewhere.

13:57.094 --> 14:01.297
I'm pretty sure those aren't
my only two options, Bobby.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.900
You're right. It's just
the first 48 hours.

14:04.901 --> 14:08.404
- 'Cause after that, the trail gets cold.
- No, no.

14:08.405 --> 14:10.973
I'm certain I'm just
overreacting, right?

14:10.974 --> 14:12.408
Sure. Don't worry.

14:12.409 --> 14:15.611
I mean, you did say, "So
what if he dealt drugs?

14:15.612 --> 14:18.714
So what if he wound up
locked up for ten years?"

14:18.715 --> 14:21.484
Cynthia, you remember all
those nights he was hanging out

14:21.485 --> 14:23.886
with Shawn and we told
ourselves, "Don't worry"?

14:23.887 --> 14:25.955
Oh, yeah. But it didn't matter though.

14:25.956 --> 14:27.656
- We still worried.
- Mm-hmm.

14:27.657 --> 14:30.659
So why don't you do what we did
when we worried about you?

14:30.660 --> 14:34.730
You can sit on the couch all
night watchin' infomercials.

14:34.731 --> 14:39.468
Do you know how many Miracle
Mops I bought because of you?

14:39.469 --> 14:41.103
A lot of 'em.

14:41.104 --> 14:44.739
And the miracle was they was just mops.

14:45.742 --> 14:46.709
Got so bad for me,

14:46.710 --> 14:48.010
the only thing to keep me awake,

14:48.011 --> 14:49.478
I had to watch the Weather Channel.

14:49.479 --> 14:52.415
Thanks to Jerrod and his
knucklehead friend Shawn,

14:52.416 --> 14:55.184
now I know the average annual rainfall

14:55.185 --> 14:59.855
of every part of this
country from 2002 to 2006.

14:59.856 --> 15:01.023
Syracuse, New York.

15:01.024 --> 15:03.192
38 inches.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.462
Wow, Daddy, you the Rain Man of rain.

15:06.463 --> 15:09.498
Hold on. Why y'all
trippin' off of Shawn?

15:09.499 --> 15:11.901
Just because he's a drug dealer
doesn't mean he's a bad guy.

15:11.902 --> 15:14.537
Some would call him an entrepreneur.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.673
Okay, relax. Let's not talk
about the man like he's

15:17.674 --> 15:19.642
an American hero.
I mean, he is a drug dealer

15:19.643 --> 15:21.277
who punched a man
in the face last night

15:21.278 --> 15:23.582
for stepping on my J's. I
thought it was cool at the time,

15:23.583 --> 15:26.597
but sober me is realizing
that's insane behavior.

15:26.598 --> 15:27.650
Well,

15:27.651 --> 15:29.752
Jerrod, you the one that
brought him into your house

15:29.753 --> 15:32.188
and said that everything
was gonna be fine.

15:32.189 --> 15:34.723
It's fine for me. I know
when not to get in the car

15:34.724 --> 15:37.660
with Shawn. But Maxine's not
used to these shady situations.

15:37.661 --> 15:39.428
She's not used to dealing
with shady people.

15:39.429 --> 15:42.865
She's only used to dealing
with amazing people like me.

15:42.866 --> 15:46.368
Jerrod, I'm sure Maxine'll be
just fine. She's not helpless.

15:46.369 --> 15:48.404
She kind of is though, Nekeisha. Like,

15:48.405 --> 15:50.148
she's not used to handling
things like this.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.774
She's not street-smart like you are.

15:51.775 --> 15:53.476
Is that your way of
calling me book-dumb?

15:53.477 --> 15:56.010
Because that is offensive.

15:57.981 --> 16:00.449
I should've never brought
Shawn into my home.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.151
Or you can look at it another way:

16:02.152 --> 16:05.587
you should've never invited
Maxine into your house.

16:07.390 --> 16:08.958
- (Maxine and Shawn chuckle)
- (scoffs)

16:08.959 --> 16:11.193
There you guys are.
Where have you been?

16:11.194 --> 16:13.329
What? Shawn asked me to take
him to see an old friend

16:13.330 --> 16:15.631
about a job. What are
you so worked up about?

16:15.632 --> 16:17.266
I've called you, like, a million times.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.601
- You didn't call me.
- Yeah.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.837
Oh, wait. Oh, my phone
is on silent. Sorry.

16:21.838 --> 16:25.541
Oh, 16 missed calls.
Geez, what's wrong?

16:25.542 --> 16:28.744
Maxine, do you mind if I talk
to Shawn alone for a minute?

16:28.745 --> 16:30.845
Yeah. All right.

16:34.818 --> 16:37.286
Shawn,

16:37.287 --> 16:39.421
where'd you have Maxine
take you just now?

16:39.422 --> 16:41.724
Why you trippin', man?
I just had to drop something off

16:41.725 --> 16:43.359
real quick. No big deal.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.693
What'd you have to drop what off?

16:44.694 --> 16:47.096
Some cocaine.

16:47.097 --> 16:48.564
Really?

16:48.565 --> 16:50.132
Yeah, the girl I was going to see,

16:50.133 --> 16:52.935
she wanted to buy some cocaine.
I was gonna get laid, too,

16:52.936 --> 16:55.479
but I didn't want to be rude and
keep Maxine waitin' in the car.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.473
You know, that's your girl and all.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.441
Why would you involve
Maxine in a drug deal?

16:59.442 --> 17:01.777
Why would you bring drugs into
my apartment in the first place?

17:01.778 --> 17:03.259
I've been trying to look out for you.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.603
Yeah, I know. And I was trying
to look out for myself, man.

17:05.604 --> 17:07.950
Listen, I got to make money, bro.
I'm a felon.

17:07.951 --> 17:10.286
What you want me to do,
work at McDonald's

17:10.287 --> 17:12.655
so I can save up enough money
to buy a little crappy car,

17:12.656 --> 17:16.457
just so I can drive back and
forth to McDonald's every day?

17:17.961 --> 17:20.128
I-I thought you understood
my dilemma, bro.

17:20.130 --> 17:22.431
What are you gonna do
when you get caught again?

17:22.432 --> 17:25.501
I spent a whole lot of time
thinkin' about that, right?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.536
Now, prison taught me
that I don't ever want

17:27.537 --> 17:28.537
to go back there.

17:28.538 --> 17:29.471
Period.

17:29.472 --> 17:31.440
But I made myself a promise.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.976
I said, "When I get back
out here selling drugs,

17:33.977 --> 17:38.781
I'm-a make sure I try real,
real hard not to get caught."

17:38.782 --> 17:40.549
(scoffing)

17:40.550 --> 17:44.486
Ten years in prison and-and
that's the lesson you learned.

17:44.487 --> 17:47.222
Listen, man, why you coming
at me like this, Jerrod?

17:47.223 --> 17:50.492
Come on, man. I'm the same
person I was ten years ago.

17:50.493 --> 17:53.095
I know. I know you are.
But I'm not, man.

17:53.096 --> 17:56.031
A lot's changed. I got
something to lose now.

17:56.032 --> 17:58.300
And if you're gonna do that,
you can't be around me,

17:58.301 --> 18:01.070
you can't be around my girl, and
you can't be around my family.

18:01.071 --> 18:03.305
Look, I-I really hate

18:03.306 --> 18:06.575
to throw you out, Shawn,
but if you're gonna do that,

18:06.576 --> 18:08.043
I'm sorry, but...

18:08.044 --> 18:10.144
you got to go, man.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.256
Hey, um,

18:21.257 --> 18:23.359
I think you should know, man,

18:23.360 --> 18:26.260
your girl got herpes.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.633
Thank you.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.140
Did Shawn just leave?

18:38.141 --> 18:40.676
Yeah. And he's not coming back either.

18:40.677 --> 18:43.912
- Why? What happened?
- Well,

18:43.913 --> 18:45.614
Maxine, how do I say this?

18:45.615 --> 18:49.218
You were just the wheelman
in a cocaine deal.

18:49.219 --> 18:51.353
What?

18:51.354 --> 18:53.822
- At that girl's house?
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.823 --> 18:56.458
He was selling her drugs?

18:56.459 --> 18:58.460
Man, I figured he was lying to me,

18:58.461 --> 19:01.130
but I thought they
were just having sex.

19:01.131 --> 19:03.165
I mean, he was only in
there for a few minutes,

19:03.166 --> 19:06.368
but, you know, the guy's been
in jail for ten years, so...

19:06.369 --> 19:11.240
Well, look, I'm really sorry you
had to get involved in all that.

19:11.241 --> 19:13.264
It's so hard for me, you know?
Like, Shawn was such

19:13.265 --> 19:15.477
an important part of my life.
And it's hard to imagine

19:15.478 --> 19:17.312
my life without him in it.

19:17.313 --> 19:19.281
Yeah, I know.

19:19.282 --> 19:22.751
But, hey, I still believe
that anyone can change.

19:22.752 --> 19:25.154
Yeah, I hope so, too.
But mostly for your sake.

19:25.155 --> 19:26.922
Shawn just used you as a drug mule,

19:26.923 --> 19:28.857
so you're a drug dealer now, Maxine.

19:28.858 --> 19:32.461
Hey, does this give me street cred?

19:32.462 --> 19:35.397
People with street cred
don't use the term

19:35.398 --> 19:37.199
- "street cred," Maxine.
- (chuckles)

19:37.200 --> 19:39.634
- They don't have to ask either.
- (laughs)

19:41.179 --> 19:44.870
- Okay. "Dear Shawn, how are you?"
- Mm-hmm.

19:44.871 --> 19:46.804
Don't ask him how he's doing.

19:46.805 --> 19:50.808
He's doing bad, Maxine.
He's back in prison.

19:50.809 --> 19:52.944
Ooh, tell Shawn that I said hey.

19:52.945 --> 19:54.779
But put, like, a lot of Es in it,

19:54.780 --> 19:58.783
so it'd be like, "Hey..."

19:58.784 --> 20:01.719
Shawn is so cute.
He's almost as cute as that dude

20:01.720 --> 20:04.121
with the mug shot picture
that got the light eyes

20:04.122 --> 20:05.623
and the teardrop tattoo.

20:05.624 --> 20:06.857
Jeremy Meeks.

20:06.858 --> 20:07.692
Yeah!

20:07.693 --> 20:08.758
(chuckles) Uh...

20:09.661 --> 20:12.663
Somethin' like that.

20:12.664 --> 20:14.865
How much time is he
gonna get this time?

20:14.866 --> 20:16.667
It wasn't an insignificant
amount of drugs.

20:16.668 --> 20:17.835
It's kind of like if

20:17.836 --> 20:20.371
Rite Aid and CVS had a baby

20:20.372 --> 20:23.541
and that baby was on crack.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.477
You remember when I coached
your boys' basketball team?

20:26.478 --> 20:27.178
Mm-hmm.

20:27.179 --> 20:28.579
Yeah, I may have told him

20:28.580 --> 20:31.048
"Go big or go home" too many times.

20:31.049 --> 20:33.417
You never know who's
gonna take to what.

20:33.418 --> 20:34.885
You never told me that.

20:34.886 --> 20:36.949
Well, I didn't want to
encourage you to do something

20:36.950 --> 20:38.850
you couldn't do, son.

20:39.258 --> 20:41.892
Daddy, you always got my back.

20:41.893 --> 20:44.161
JERROD: Maxine,

20:44.162 --> 20:45.963
tell Shawn to keep his head up

20:45.964 --> 20:47.632
and also tell him you
don't have herpes.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.266
I don't want that floatin'
around the prison system.

20:51.074 --> 20:58.566
