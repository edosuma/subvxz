WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:02.759
Previously
on Pretty Little Liars .

00:02.800 --> 00:04.461
They found Ali's body.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.536
( mobile phone ringing )
I'm here still here, bitches.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.333
ALL:
And I know everything.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.564
Alison.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.669
She is alive _
and I can prove It.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.632
Alison is alive?

00:13.680 --> 00:14.772
( door opens )

00:14.810 --> 00:16.277
Surprise.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.369
The cash, passport
and plane ticket,

00:18.410 --> 00:20.071
you need to leave
for the airport in an hour.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.088
Until I know who "A" is,
I can't come home.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.384
Let "A" think you're dead.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.546
Mona played me
like a fool.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.512
She got exactly
what she wanted.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.255
Ezra's still looking
for me, Aria.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.520
He thinks that if he saves me,
he'll win you back.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.822
If you're looking
to make a deal...

00:32.860 --> 00:34.293
I know
who killed that girl,

00:34.330 --> 00:36.525
the one you thought
was Alison DiLaurentis.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.262
Ali, run!

00:39.300 --> 00:40.836
Hey, hey, I know
who you are.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.701
( gunshot)

00:42.740 --> 00:43.707
No.

00:43.740 --> 00:44.707
I'm sorry.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.729
Shh.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.077
( siren wailing )

00:51.710 --> 00:53.371
His pulse
is getting weaker.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.139
Hey, let me go, please.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.409
I heard a gunshot
and I ran up to the roof.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.485
But when I got there,
he was lying on the ground.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.080
Aria, we cannot do anything
to help him right now.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.324
If they think you know
anything about this,

01:05.360 --> 01:06.691
you're gonna spend
the entire night

01:06.730 --> 01:08.288
answering questions
at the police station.

01:08.330 --> 01:09.467
You're never gonna get
to the hospital.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.694
Spencer's right.

01:10.730 --> 01:11.822
We'll find out
where they're taking him

01:11.870 --> 01:13.599
and we'll get you there.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.835
Folks, could you
step back please?

01:15.870 --> 01:20.500
( siren wailing )

01:26.750 --> 01:27.842
* Got a secret

01:27.880 --> 01:29.381
* Can you keep it?

01:29.420 --> 01:31.718
* Swear this one you'll save

01:31.750 --> 01:34.310
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

01:34.360 --> 01:36.726
* Taking this one
to the grave *

01:36.760 --> 01:39.228
* If I show you
then I know you *

01:39.260 --> 01:41.854
* Won't tell what I said

01:41.900 --> 01:44.425
* Cause two can
keep a secret *

01:44.470 --> 01:47.098
* If one of them is dead

01:49.640 --> 01:51.369
PARAMEDIC: Priority one.
Mid-20$, male.

01:51.410 --> 01:52.877
Single GSW to the abdomen.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.401
Last pulse was 142.
Systolic 80.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.338
( indistinct chatter )

02:02.550 --> 02:04.484
( indistinct chatter )

02:04.520 --> 02:06.181
He's herniating.
Get him to the OR.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.828
SPENCER: You _know
what to say, right?

02:12.860 --> 02:15.226
Don't stay on the line a second
longer than you have to.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.566
It's the strongest one
they had.

02:21.370 --> 02:22.906
Are you sure
you want to do this?

02:22.940 --> 02:25.261
Ezra just saved my life.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.771
And he probably
saved yours, too.

02:28.810 --> 02:30.368
Hanna's right.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.776
There's no way
my mom made that jump.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.811
She's not "A."
But Ezra knows who is.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.444
Look, Em, the plan was to
get All out of town tonight,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.458
but now that we know
that "A's" after Ezra...

02:39.490 --> 02:41.253
I get that "A" wants
to shut Ezra up,

02:41.290 --> 02:43.485
okay,
but Ali's still a target.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.418
Can't we think
of another way to do this?

02:46.830 --> 02:49.321
If Ezra...

02:49.370 --> 02:50.723
when Ezra pulls through,

02:50.770 --> 02:52.260
he's going to tell us
who "A" is,

02:52.300 --> 02:53.836
and this thing
is finally gonna be over.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.628
HANNA: Hi, the guy
who just got shot

02:57.670 --> 02:59.934
at Bank and Hudson
IS Ezra Fitz.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.470
Yeah, I think that
you should send a cop

03:01.510 --> 03:03.375
to the hospital
because I saw what happened,

03:03.410 --> 03:06.311
and I don't think
this was a random thing.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.669
Well, yeah,
but he might not be safe

03:07.720 --> 03:09.483
so you better go fast.

03:10.650 --> 03:11.947
Are they
sending somebody?

03:11.990 --> 03:13.457
Yeah,
I heard her typing.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.850
Look, they're probably
on their way.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.424
Are we sure that
we want to split up?

03:20.460 --> 03:21.950
A wise commander
takes measures

03:22.000 --> 03:23.319
to always
let his opponent react

03:23.370 --> 03:24.769
to the wrong
set of circumstances.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.926
And in 400 BC--

03:25.970 --> 03:28.564
Okay, Spencer, we get it.
We're decoys.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.830
We don't need
a history lesson.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.633
There's no art
to this war, Spencer.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.272
You've read Sun Tzu?

03:34.310 --> 03:36.449
ARIA: Okay, let's go.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.742
HANNA: Wait.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.908
Just in case.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.949
We'll give you
10 minutes, okay,

03:46.990 --> 03:48.355
and then we're
making the call.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.759
Em, come on.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.290
Look, if you want to get
to the hospital before them,

03:59.340 --> 04:00.693
we have to go now.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.867
We know that "A" is always
one step ahead of us.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.865
Yeah.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.902
Maybe he,
she, it, bitch is.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.430
But you have
to remember that

04:08.480 --> 04:10.675
Ali's been hiding
in plain sight for two years.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.678
She can handle herself.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.869
And if "A"
sees us there first,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.410
then this could work.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.883
Thank you
for checking in, Ashley.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.955
Nobody's getting
any sleep here tonight,

04:24.990 --> 04:27.356
_so don't hesitate to call
if you hear from Hanna.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.891
Of course.
We'll do the same.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.932
Bye.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.875
All this time Spencer knew
Alison was alive?

04:42.910 --> 04:44.741
I don't want
to believe that,

04:44.780 --> 04:45.940
because if that's true,

04:45.980 --> 04:47.447
I have no idea_
who your Sister is.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.946
The photograph that
Detective Holbrook showed me

04:51.990 --> 04:54.709
of the girls with Alison
was taken a month ago.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.752
I want to think that that was
the first time they saw her,

04:57.790 --> 04:58.825
because it makes sense,

04:58.860 --> 05:00.452
that's when it all
started again.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.661
The pills?

05:02.700 --> 05:04.429
The pills and the lying.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.359
It was just like last time
Spencer was out of control.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.859
It's so like
All to do this to her.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.400
Honey, we don't know
anything about

05:12.440 --> 05:16.501
where Alison's been
or what she's gone through.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.506
I'm trying
to reserve judgment.

05:18.550 --> 05:21.417
Mom, Alison was
at the center of every mess

05:21.450 --> 05:22.940
that Spencer got into.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.685
She's a walking time bomb,

05:24.720 --> 05:26.517
but it's never
All who blows up.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.427
It's everything and
everyone else around her.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.928
I understand running away.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.928
But to let your
friends and family think

05:33.960 --> 05:35.848
you're dead?

05:42.870 --> 05:45.100
I really thought

05:45.140 --> 05:46.607
_it was Alison
in that grave.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.808
We all did.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.772
But I saw that picture

05:51.810 --> 05:54.119
and she's very much alive.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.119
I'm not crying for Alison.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.789
There is another family
missing their daughter.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.879
And she really is dead.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.651
The police will find out
who that girl is.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.420
It's just
a matter of time.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.600
Mom...

06:18.610 --> 06:20.669
there's something
you need to know.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.514
( car door slams )

06:32.220 --> 06:34.950
( doorbell rings )

06:43.500 --> 06:45.923
I don't understand
how Ezra found us.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.495
Maybe
he didn't find us.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.939
I think he was
following "A."

06:49.970 --> 06:52.609
And "A" was following us.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.471
This is what you were
always so afraid of.

06:54.510 --> 06:55.909
That we'd lead "A" to you.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.408
Aria, you know why Ezra's
still looking for me.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.547
It's 'ca_use he wants
to Win you back.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.149
Does he have a chance?

07:06.190 --> 07:08.715
Ali, I can't think
about that right now.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.022
I don't even know
if he's alive.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.525
I wanted
to tell you in person

07:17.570 --> 07:20.539
that CeCe Drake escaped
police custody tonight.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.231
We found Officer
Maple unconSCIous

07:22.270 --> 07:24.465
on a road
outside of town.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.932
So far
we have not been able

07:25.970 --> 07:28.473
to locate CeCe
or his patrol car.

07:28.510 --> 07:31.104
I don't understand why you
came here to tell us this.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.675
CeCe knows that
Alison is alive

07:33.720 --> 07:35.847
and I think she knows
where the girls are.

07:36.850 --> 07:39.148
If she's mixed up in this,

07:39.190 --> 07:41.613
your daughter could be
in more danger than ever.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.554
So if there's anything

07:46.600 --> 07:48.454
that you haven't told me...

07:51.870 --> 07:54.065
We've told you
everything that we know.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.868
REPORTER: ( on TV) Police
have also widened their search

08:03.910 --> 08:05.844
for the four missing
Rosewood teens

08:05.880 --> 08:07.916
who they believe
are in Philadelphia

08:07.950 --> 08:09.747
with Alison DiLaurentis.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.883
The youth went
missing two years ago

08:11.920 --> 08:13.717
and is thought to have been
brutally murdered---

08:18.790 --> 08:21.691
This changes everything.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.626
There's a ton
of debris in here.

08:58.670 --> 08:59.796
I need hands.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.637
He's losing
too much blood.

09:03.670 --> 09:04.932
Clamp that artery.

09:04.970 --> 09:05.937
Now!

09:05.970 --> 09:07.938
Okay.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.777
( rapid beeping )

09:10.810 --> 09:12.346
I'm doing my part,
Mr. Fitz.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.916
You got to do yours.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.813
Don't die on me.

09:23.990 --> 09:24.979
This way.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.689
Let's go.

09:38.710 --> 09:39.972
Okay,
now what do we do?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.269
We wait.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.721
Hi, we are looking
for a patient

10:00.760 --> 10:02.125
that was just
admitted, Ezra Fitz?

10:06.170 --> 10:08.161
I hate this.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.929
Let's just hope it works.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.150
WOMAN: ( on P.A.)
Alison DiLaurentis,

10:30.190 --> 10:31.851
please report
to the Emergency Room.

10:31.890 --> 10:35.894
Alison DiLaurentis report
to the Emergency Room.

10:48.710 --> 10:49.904
Okay, you better
get out of here.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.055
Stairs!

11:23.980 --> 11:26.949
( siren wailing )

11:57.250 --> 11:58.899
WOMAN: Taxi!

12:04.420 --> 12:05.739
( tires screeching )

12:05.790 --> 12:06.757
( honking )

12:06.790 --> 12:08.018
MAN: Hey!

12:13.530 --> 12:16.761
( saxophone
music playing )

13:14.060 --> 13:17.188
( metal clanking )

13:23.270 --> 13:24.567
( whispering )
Want to play?

13:28.970 --> 13:30.369
It's over.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.207
No. It's not.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.009
Did you really think
we'd let Ali

13:35.040 --> 13:36.530
leave that hospital alone?

13:36.580 --> 13:39.401
We paged Alison so you'd
know she was there.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.078
I guess you don't read
Sun Tzu, bitch.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.189
Hey!

13:43.220 --> 13:46.610
( gasping )

13:46.650 --> 13:49.050
Are you sure that's "A"?

13:49.090 --> 13:51.058
Maybe I'm "A"!

13:51.090 --> 13:53.354
Or maybe it's one of them.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.492
Maybe I'm "A".

14:03.040 --> 14:05.258
( laughter )

14:10.250 --> 14:12.343
( siren wailing )

14:12.380 --> 14:14.974
COP: NYPD break it up.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.215
All right, folks,
we need you to disperse now.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.115
"A" was one step
ahead of us.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.024
At least we got
"A" away from Ezra.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.857
Let's get out of here.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.536
NURSE:
Mrs. Fitzgerald.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.132
We've successfully
removed the bullet

14:40.180 --> 14:42.307
but arterial _
damage is extenswe.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.409
Yes, that's right.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.546
NURSE: Yes.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.545
You need to stay
on top of this.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.416
We're mobilizing.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.878
They're not
in Philadelphia...

15:04.300 --> 15:05.699
they're in New York.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.539
You said there'd be
more people here.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.509
They're coming.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.389
You scared me.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.382
I can't keep this
a secret anymore.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.355
I want to tell
Holbrook the truth.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.296
When Spencer finds out,

15:41.340 --> 15:42.637
sheWIhave
a reason to come home.

16:00.590 --> 16:04.481
Your mother can never know
what you told me.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.399
( phone ringing )

16:24.450 --> 16:25.542
This is Holbrook.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.549
WOMAN: A detective
from the NYPD is on the line.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.672
Put him through.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.608
We've got a lot
going on here tonight.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.015
What can I help you with?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.159
Why would a shooting
in New York involve us?

16:46.170 --> 16:48.764
Okay, I'll look into him
and get back to you.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.199
Thank you.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.708
I'm sorry
you lost that bitch,

17:04.750 --> 17:06.240
but you did get
"A" out of here.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.053
Is Ezra out of surgery?

17:08.090 --> 17:10.581
I heard them tell Ezra's mom
that the bullet

17:10.630 --> 17:12.154
traveled up and hit...

17:15.300 --> 17:18.497
She's getting on a plane,
but she's in Sydney.

17:18.530 --> 17:20.395
And there's nobody here
for him but me.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.759
HANNA: Do you want us
to come there?

17:21.800 --> 17:22.835
No.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.565
No, so far
I'm blending in,

17:24.610 --> 17:26.066
but I think
with the five of us,

17:26.110 --> 17:27.532
it might be
waving a red flag.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.604
Once he's out of surgery,

17:28.640 --> 17:31.279
it's still gonna take him
a few hours to wake up.

17:31.310 --> 17:33.141
We need to find
somewhere to go.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.171
Call us as soon_
as you hear anything.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.414
I will.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.339
Guys, promise me
you'll be safe.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.414
Don't worry about us, Aria.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.553
We'll be okay.
We promise.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.080
Bye.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.828
If "A" can't
get to Ezra,

17:46.860 --> 17:49.192
you're the available
target tonight.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.424
Yeah, Em's right.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.823
I mean, we can't
just stand out here

17:51.870 --> 17:53.838
in the street like sitting...

17:53.870 --> 17:55.064
ducks.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.465
I know
a place we can go.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.139
Come on.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.749
Well...

18:41.780 --> 18:44.487
If you wanted to impress
someone with a "wow" moment,

18:44.520 --> 18:47.409
this would definitely be
how you'd do it.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.883
He didn't bring me here
to impress me.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.456
This was kind
of his special place.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.448
So you know somebody
who works here?

18:55.860 --> 18:58.693
Uh, yeah, a friend
of the family.

18:58.730 --> 18:59.822
Well, when you said that
you were gonna take me

18:59.870 --> 19:00.894
to the theater,

19:00.940 --> 19:02.931
I thought you meant
to see a play.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.631
Are you disappointed?

19:17.520 --> 19:18.748
Wow.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.949
I get it.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.423
Get what?

19:26.890 --> 19:28.824
It's hard to explain.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.498
Try me.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.466
God, imagine
being up here,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.978
with all those people
out there who love you.

19:41.010 --> 19:44.241
I think that's called
adoration, not love.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.348
I could be an actress.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.677
Could be?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.608
Well, I hate
to break it to you

19:50.650 --> 19:52.584
but you already are.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.281
The way you
tell your stories

19:56.320 --> 19:57.958
with such conviction.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.299
I think you've
convinced yourself

20:00.330 --> 20:01.524
that half of them
are true.

20:04.730 --> 20:08.268
Well, if you can't
convince yourself,

20:08.300 --> 20:10.439
why should
anyone else believe you?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.461
You really are my
Holly Golightly.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.429
VVho?

20:16.980 --> 20:20.438
( door closes )

20:20.480 --> 20:21.742
Are you sure
we're allowed to be here?

20:22.950 --> 20:24.247
Who's there?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.878
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.750
My apologies.

20:28.790 --> 20:31.429
I was just locking up
on my way out.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.779
No, don't worry
about it, Bill.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.024
Have a good night.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.493
Okay, good night.

20:39.630 --> 20:41.689
Mr. Fitzgerald?

20:44.370 --> 20:47.976
That's when I realized
Ezra was a rich boy

20:48.010 --> 20:49.773
pretending
to be a poor boy.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.404
I actually liked him
more for that.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.318
Not because he didn't
want the money,

20:56.350 --> 21:00.389
but because
he totally had me fooled.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.781
I actually thought
that was an asset back then.

21:11.900 --> 21:12.867
Wow.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.299
This is a real gun.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.329
Hanna!

21:17.810 --> 21:20.404
So you think we'll be
okay here until morning?

21:20.440 --> 21:22.579
I've stayed
over a few times.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.669
They don't open up
the place until noon.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.841
( stomach rumbling )

21:28.880 --> 21:30.381
What was that?

21:30.420 --> 21:31.910
TOGETHER:
Spencer's stomach.

21:31.950 --> 21:34.384
Sorry, I haven't had
anything to eat

21:34.420 --> 21:36.081
since a petit four
at the bridal show.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.918
Come on, let's raid
the concession stand.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.552
You think that it's still
gonna be stocked?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.591
Spence, we need
to get you some food.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.427
I'm literally at the point
where I cannot think.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.400
Well, I guess Nutty Chews
can count as a protein

21:55.440 --> 21:57.943
and Gummy Bears
as a fruit.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.140
I don't care,
I was so hungry

21:59.180 --> 22:01.717
I was about to eat the foam
out of those seat cushions.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.717
I saw that episode.

22:02.750 --> 22:03.717
Me, too.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.809
That lady went through
three couches in a year.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.386
What show is this?

22:07.420 --> 22:08.489
Freaky Foodies.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.487
Have you seen it?

22:09.520 --> 22:10.521
Spencer's obsessed.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.458
What and you're not?

22:11.490 --> 22:13.822
We watched that
entire marathon together.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.090
Oh, my God, remember that guy
who ate the dryer sheets?

22:16.130 --> 22:18.667
Ew, that was so gross.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.134
I need to find a better place
to make a call.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.536
Who do you
need to talk to?

22:23.570 --> 22:24.969
I have a few friends
that are gonna be worried now

22:25.010 --> 22:26.898
that the police know
I'm alive.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.703
They've risked
a lot to help me,

22:28.740 --> 22:30.503
I just need to let them know
that I'm okay.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.869
I'll be right back.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.027
Hello.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.496
ALI: Yeah, it's me.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.837
( Ali talking
very quietly)

23:24.570 --> 23:25.821
Shana?

23:25.870 --> 23:27.997
Ali sent me
to make sure you're okay.

23:30.070 --> 23:32.061
Look, I get that
you're her loyal companion,

23:32.110 --> 23:33.975
but I don't
need a watchdog.

23:34.010 --> 23:35.898
You don't have
to like me, Aria.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.044
ButI made a promise,
so I'm staying.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.048
Can I get you something?

23:51.090 --> 23:52.421
No. Thanks.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.494
You look exhausted.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.609
Don't worry.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.198
If you fall asleep,
I'll wake you up

24:06.240 --> 24:07.207
if there's any news.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.502
I'm fine.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.618
SPENCER: Is it just me
or does it already feel like

24:14.650 --> 24:16.743
she's shutting us
out again?

24:16.780 --> 24:17.883
Shh.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.989
What?

24:19.020 --> 24:20.556
She can hear you.

24:20.590 --> 24:21.818
She's sleeping.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.782
She's Ali.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.901
She's sleeping.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.999
Thanks, Han.

24:44.010 --> 24:45.875
It makes sense that All
had people helping her.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.139
You know, if it were us,
we'd want her to call.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.114
We'd want to know
that she was okay.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.789
That's the thing, Em.
It is us.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.118
We're the ones who are
risking everything to help her.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.980
It's not some
random do-gooders

24:58.030 --> 24:59.827
that she's met
along the way.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.948
We just have to wait it out
a few more hours.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.797
Once Ezra tells us
who "A" is,

25:04.830 --> 25:06.229
this will finally be over.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.693
From your lips
to God's ears.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.203
When did you
become religious?

25:12.240 --> 25:14.800
My mom's dating
a preacher, remember?

25:16.080 --> 25:18.105
Can you imagine what life
would be like without "A"?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.539
When was the last time
you guys had a hobby?

25:22.920 --> 25:24.547
Neven

25:25.990 --> 25:28.015
I wouldn't mind
taking up a sport though.

25:29.790 --> 25:30.882
Which one?

25:33.230 --> 25:34.754
I don't know.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.825
I've always liked
Spencer's field hockey skirt.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.227
You can totally have it.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.799
What about you, Spence?

25:50.210 --> 25:52.041
I wouldn't want
to go back to the person

25:52.080 --> 25:53.741
that I was before.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.948
All I cared about
was Winning.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.722
And now I just really
want to be happy.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.976
( gasps )

27:35.480 --> 27:37.072
How did you find me?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.442
Well, we don't
just look alike.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.879
We think alike, too.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.150
You took a big risk
coming here.

27:45.190 --> 27:47.420
I didn't have a choice.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.918
Alison, you asked
for my help in Ravenswood.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.824
Now I need yours.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.341
So Fitz is a Fitzgerald.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.750
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

28:18.790 --> 28:20.326
It has to.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.850
I don't have
another choice.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.321
We should be okay
if we do this today.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.361
The cops are still looking
in Philadelphia.

28:34.940 --> 28:37.272
You having
second thoughts?

28:37.310 --> 28:39.301
No.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.944
I just realized this might be
the last time I see you.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.016
Don't be so dramatic,
Ali.

28:44.050 --> 28:45.347
You know us.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.818
We always find
a way back to each other.

28:49.860 --> 28:51.452
Is this the part
where you guys kiss?

28:53.230 --> 28:54.754
Had to ask.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.320
You better get going.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.972
Thank you.

29:13.150 --> 29:14.947
You'd do
the same for me.

29:44.510 --> 29:46.205
Is Ezra Fitz
out of surgery?

29:46.250 --> 29:47.979
NURSE: He's in recovery.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.442
( sighs )

29:53.550 --> 29:54.881
What are you doing?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.354
You said that you'd
wake me up.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.927
He's still unconscious,
but he's stable.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.460
Ezra?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.471
( monitor beeping )

30:23.150 --> 30:25.038
Help!

30:25.090 --> 30:26.148
Help!

30:26.190 --> 30:28.215
Help!
We need some help in here!

30:28.260 --> 30:29.557
Hurry!

30:29.590 --> 30:31.455
( indistinct )

30:38.300 --> 30:40.359
MAN ( over PA):
Code Blue, we need 123.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.878
EMILY:
Where have you been?

31:01.520 --> 31:03.385
Em, please don't
wake up the others.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.493
We're all in this
together, Ali.

31:08.530 --> 31:09.929
At least
that's what we thought.

31:13.130 --> 31:14.358
There are some things

31:14.400 --> 31:16.493
you don't need
to know about, Em.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.132
Okay?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.604
It's better that way.

31:22.410 --> 31:24.139
That's not a good
enough answer.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.255
Come on.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.918
Some of you may know
each other,

31:45.970 --> 31:47.198
some of you may not.

31:47.230 --> 31:48.390
But I picked you

31:48.440 --> 31:50.396
because _
we all have one thing

31:50.440 --> 31:51.464
in common,

31:51.510 --> 31:54.035
and that's
Alison DiLaurentis.

31:54.080 --> 31:58.107
When Alison was here,
I wasn't Mona.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.447
I was Loser Mona.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.912
Who were you, Lucas?

32:06.190 --> 32:07.543
Hermie.

32:07.590 --> 32:09.410
Hmm.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.586
How about you, Paige?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.525
I can say it
if you don't want to.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.959
She called you Pigskin.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.163
MAN 1: I was Pus Face.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.631
MAN 2: I was Newt.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.659
WOMAN 1: Lez.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.132
WOMAN 2: Whore.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.104
But you weren't
those people.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.505
That's just
what she called you.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.632
Not who you are.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.375
Sticks and stones, Mona.

32:32.410 --> 32:33.672
I'm not afraid
of her anymore.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.575
Well,
maybe you should be.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.212
She's not even back yet,
and she found a way

32:37.250 --> 32:38.387
to break up you
and Emily.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.058
There's no way

32:42.090 --> 32:43.717
Ali's gonna let you guys
be a couple.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.648
Exactly what is it
you want us to do?

32:45.690 --> 32:47.419
I want us
to stick together.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.155
There's strength
in numbers.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.668
The bigger we are,
the harder she falls.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.563
I don't think I want
to be a part of this.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.259
I can't protect you
if you're not with us.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.247
We don't have much time.

33:15.760 --> 33:19.059
Ezra was paying CeCe
for information.

33:19.090 --> 33:20.182
That's why
she was in Ravenswood.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.524
So she wasn't ever
really Red Coat?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.367
No, I asked her
to wear that hoping that

33:26.400 --> 33:28.163
she would distract "A"
so I could turn off the saw.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.100
"A" put you in that box.
Not CeCe.

33:33.070 --> 33:34.401
She helped me
save your life.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.605
Why does this have
to be a secret?

33:40.650 --> 33:42.174
Why can't you tell
the other girls?

33:42.220 --> 33:46.111
CeCe killed a cop, Em,

33:46.150 --> 33:48.152
and part of why she did
that was for me.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.624
Look, if she gets busted
boarding that plane,

33:51.660 --> 33:53.685
my face
is on the passport.

33:53.730 --> 33:56.221
That makes me
an accessory.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.591
And now you know about it.

33:57.630 --> 33:58.665
That makes you one, too.

34:00.370 --> 34:03.464
You guys have done
so much for me.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.365
You do not need to go out
on a limb for CeCe.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.234
I will take the fall
for it alone

34:08.280 --> 34:09.702
if it comes to it.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.676
( footsteps approaching )

34:13.710 --> 34:16.577
Hey, Aria's on the phone,
but we can't hear her.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.115
Tell her to call
the house line.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.754
( dialing )

34:38.810 --> 34:40.437
Ezra made it
through surgery,

34:40.470 --> 34:42.301
but I haven't
been able to--

34:42.340 --> 34:44.069
Damn it.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.584
( telephone ringing )

34:54.790 --> 34:57.350
Hello, can you hear me?

34:57.390 --> 34:58.584
HOLBROOK: Hello?

35:02.200 --> 35:03.792
Alison?

35:14.310 --> 35:15.834
What is it?

35:22.850 --> 35:24.715
The NYPD needs
to send somebody

35:24.750 --> 35:26.718
to the Fitzgerald Theater
on West 44th Street.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.184
I think we have a 10-20
on Alison DiLaurentis.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.452
Oh, pick up.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.491
Come on, guys.
Pick up.

35:36.530 --> 35:38.725
( telephone ringing )

36:29.850 --> 36:32.580
Hey...

36:32.620 --> 36:34.485
you're gonna be okay.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.421
( whispering )

36:42.460 --> 36:43.722
What is it?

36:46.930 --> 36:48.568
Did you recognize
the voice?

36:48.600 --> 36:49.669
No.

36:49.700 --> 36:50.894
Okay.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.760
We can't wait for Ezra
to tell us who "A" is.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.300
We have to get you
to the airport.

36:54.340 --> 36:55.272
You can still
use that passport

36:55.310 --> 36:56.902
and that ticket
that Noel gave you, right?

36:56.940 --> 36:58.441
I don't have it anymore.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.708
What?

37:03.580 --> 37:06.515
( whispering )

37:20.630 --> 37:22.734
I gave away my get out
of town free card

37:22.770 --> 37:23.759
to someone who needed it
more than I did.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.859
Ali, who needs more help
than you do right now?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.263
It doesn't matter.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.607
It does to us.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.938
Look, Ali, either you
trust us or you don't.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.538
No more secrets, Ali.

37:32.580 --> 37:33.877
You were wrong before.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.878
They didn't
keep us together.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.944
We can argue
about this in the cab.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.379
Okay?
Let's grab our stuff and go.

37:43.790 --> 37:44.859
SPENCER: Come on.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.255
EMILY:
But we have to hurry.

37:53.530 --> 37:54.736
Who's out there?

38:08.550 --> 38:10.313
Couldn't have picked
a better place

38:10.350 --> 38:11.783
to end your story.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.640
Shana?

38:13.690 --> 38:14.952
Shana?

38:14.990 --> 38:17.788
I thought I locked you
all together at the lodge.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.550
But I guess you were late
to the party, Alison.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.057
So much for fighting fire
with ﬁre.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.522
Put the gun down, Shana.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.720
Get back, Spencer.

38:25.730 --> 38:26.924
Get back.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.062
I trusted you, Shana.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.738
You once told me
the only way to trust

38:29.770 --> 38:32.000
someone was to not ask
too many questions.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.474
And then you sent me
to Rosewood to ask questions.

38:34.510 --> 38:36.375
Move.

38:36.410 --> 38:37.877
Shana.

38:37.910 --> 38:40.071
Why--

38:40.110 --> 38:42.044
Why would you
turn on me like this?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.947
I got so many answers
from all the people you hurt.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.787
Your own mother
was afraid of you.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.952
Get back!

38:49.990 --> 38:51.548
Ali's made mistakes,

38:51.590 --> 38:53.785
okay, Shana,
but what makes you better?

38:53.830 --> 38:55.752
You're sick, Shana.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.028
Like Mona was,
but we can get you help.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.096
I'm not Mona.
This isn't a game.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.360
So what is it?

39:01.400 --> 39:02.731
Justice.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.829
SPENCER: For who?

39:04.870 --> 39:06.337
Jenna.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.377
You fell in love
with her.

39:10.410 --> 39:13.004
You have no_ idea
who she is.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.108
We never meant--

39:14.150 --> 39:16.345
Get back
or I'll blow your head off!

39:17.620 --> 39:19.781
What did you
call it once, Ali?

39:19.820 --> 39:21.014
A happy accident?

39:21.050 --> 39:23.018
Jenna doesn't love you,
Shana.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.755
She's playing you.

39:24.790 --> 39:25.757
That's what she does.

39:25.790 --> 39:26.757
No, that's what you do.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.655
So what?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.794
She's the mastermind
and you're her henchman?

39:31.830 --> 39:33.695
Jenna doesn't even know
I'm here.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.038
And she'll never know.

39:35.070 --> 39:37.630
And once I'm done
with you,

39:37.670 --> 39:39.638
she can finally
get back to her life.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.629
Hey, Shana!

39:43.680 --> 39:44.647
( gunshot)

39:44.680 --> 39:46.705
( screaming )

40:15.080 --> 40:16.672
She's dead.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.679
You did what
you had to do, okay?

40:27.850 --> 40:29.909
EMILY:
Spencer's right.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.689
She would have
killed all of us.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.922
It really is over.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.055
It's over.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.089
Yeah.

40:43.570 --> 40:45.003
Let's go home.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.941
_ We can't
just leave her here.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.585
There's been an accident.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.859
Enjoy your flight, sir.

41:28.550 --> 41:30.609
Welcome aboard,
Miss Darkbloom.

41:30.650 --> 41:31.844
Merci.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.654
( speaking French )
