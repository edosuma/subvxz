02:39.201 --> 02:40.418
Cheers, mate.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.981
Yo.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.818
Hey, Elvis. You've seen D?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.232
I'm not looking for D.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.526
You on the dollies again?

03:54.693 --> 03:56.491
Do you see a welcome sign
over my head?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.745
Go away, Baz.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.417
Brass monkeys, man.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.663
Where are you crashing tonight?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.334
No, seriously. You've seen D?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.594
Seriously, I'm on the script.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.555
I mean it this time.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.137
Yeah, who doesn't?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.723
Well, tell D I'm looking for him, yeah?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.400
Three quid, mate.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.608
Eighty and two...

04:34.775 --> 04:37.449
...four, six, eight, ten...

04:38.111 --> 04:39.738
You're short.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.490
It's all I've got.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.908
It's three quid, mate.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.701
Come on, I've barely eaten all day.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.041
It's three quid.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.674
- Can you let me off 9p?
- No!

04:51.958 --> 04:55.007
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll play you a little song, yeah?

04:55.378 --> 04:56.814
How about that?
Play you a little song...

04:56.838 --> 04:59.011
...and you let me off 9p, okay?
All right.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.821
- Thanks, mate. That's great.
- Don't come back.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.572
- Okay.
- Don't want you here. Go on!

05:14.731 --> 05:16.699
All right! Okay, I'm going.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.194
Thanks a lot.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.551
Get out of here!

05:34.709 --> 05:35.801
Sorry, sorry.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.931
Yo, Elvis. Get in.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.355
- Whose is it?
- The bloke who forgot to lock it.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.115
I found D.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.079
Have some.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.968
Hey! I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
No, no, no.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.629
That's nice, that's nice.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.173
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do. You're late.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.179
- Who are these?
- I don't know. It's your car!

06:23.216 --> 06:24.809
How long have they been here? Hey!

06:24.968 --> 06:27.391
What are you doing in my car?
You didn't knock on the door?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.771
- Why should I?
- James.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.931
James!

06:30.098 --> 06:31.896
James! James, come on, wake up.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.652
- You can't do this! Not now!
- Did you see them get in?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.813
- Do I look like a genie?
- From a certain angle.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.982
Hey! What? Come back here!

06:39.733 --> 06:43.533
- Get after him, will you? Hey.
- This isn't Batman and Robin, you know.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.135
- Hey.
- Pay for the ticket and move.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.575
Wake up. You're in my car. Hey.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.411
Wait, he's...

06:51.953 --> 06:53.955
He's not moving.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.176
Did they bring my guitar?

07:02.672 --> 07:03.969
Nice to see you, too.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.388
Sorry, I'm not exactly myself
this morning.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.353
That's a matter of opinion.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.023
- They brought it to me.
- To you?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.117
Well, it isn't our first time
at this circus, is it?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.358
I'm sorry.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.190
I know I made a mistake.
I messed up.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.152
Tell me something I haven't
already heard 20 times today.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.488
Good.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.745
I prefer the sound of silence
to bullshit.

07:24.903 --> 07:25.995
How do you feel?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.827
Like death.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.284
Look at me, I'm...

07:32.035 --> 07:33.127
It's horrible.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.288
Turns out you've also got hepatitis.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.790
Congratulations.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.378
Ever wonder why you see so many
old alkies, never junkies?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.439
You're all full of good news
this morning, aren't you?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.636
You can't mix heroin with methadone.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.722
You OD. You know this stuff.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.058
- Yeah.
- Do it again, and you'll probably die.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
I know. Look, I...

07:54.849 --> 07:57.523
- I'm sorry...
- Silence over bullshit.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.398
Right.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.364
- I'll see you when you're discharged.
- Yeah.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.138
- Hi.
- Did you nick an orderly's uniform?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.057
No, I didn't nick it.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.560
A nurse gave it to me
because they lost my T-shirt.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.515
Right.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.352
You know the drill. Sign that one...

08:34.514 --> 08:37.984
...and take that one to the chemist
every day for your methadone.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.486
Check in with me every two weeks.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.489
And addicts who stop the methadone
and go back to heroin...

08:43.648 --> 08:47.152
- ...have a higher percentage of ODing.
- Of ODing. Yeah, I know this already.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.867
It's my job to tell you.
Fall off methadone...

08:50.030 --> 08:52.133
...and it's more likely you'll OD
the next time you do heroin.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.125
And you could well die.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.661
Yeah.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.249
Is there anyone I can call?

08:57.412 --> 08:58.914
Any relative anywhere?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.378
I'm kind of solo these days.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.340
No word from your dad?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.004
Or mum?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.630
Yeah.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.049
"Get lost."

09:09.215 --> 09:11.638
- I guess that's two words.
- Here you go.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.144
Thank you.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.056
You're gonna play something for me?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.474
You wanna hear me sing?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.983
Are you any good?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.232
Okay.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.656
Here you are, mate.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.501
Hey, get moving.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.045
Come on, on your way.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.521
I wouldn't be begging you
if it wasn't a special case.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.038
Special?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.583
I've got three single mums
waiting for a spot.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.667
I've got a sweet old pensioner
getting kicked out of his son's house.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.502
They all need emergency housing.
They're all special.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.133
Please.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.670
What's so special about a drug addict?
Why this one?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.338
I don't know.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.053
Every now and then, one comes along...

11:15.008 --> 11:17.727
...and you just know
they have it in them to be clean.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.388
I think this is his last shot.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.144
He really wants to be clean,
but he's got nothing.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.934
No support system at all.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.694
I have to get him off the street,
or I'm gonna lose him.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.864
No. I'm not giving a spot to a user.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.617
- He's in the program.
- He falls off methadone, he's out.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.869
- Period.
- He won't.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.950
I hope.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.098
Come on, everybody.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.634
Come on, then. Albert, this side.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.602
- Val?
- Hey. Come in.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.270
Welcome home.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.217
It was a little bit stuffy,
so I just opened a window.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.010
Hot water.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.430
Look, I've gotta run.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.266
- Keys.
- Right, yeah.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.483
Val, I...

13:32.645 --> 13:33.942
You're welcome.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.949
And I put some cereal in the kitchen
and milk in the fridge.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.452
I don't know what to say.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.581
Say you're gonna stay in the program
and you won't miss our next meeting.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.538
I promise. I promise you.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.752
Cross my heart, hope to die.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.795
Okay.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.836
I'll see you out.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.549
Whoever's there, you better leave!

14:43.132 --> 14:44.884
I mean it!

14:46.219 --> 14:48.221
I've got a weapon here!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.643
I'm seriously armed!

15:27.135 --> 15:28.762
That was you making all that noise?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.689
How did you get...

15:31.848 --> 15:32.849
I see.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.818
You're a thief, are you?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.952
Stealing all my corn flakes?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.789
Hey, are you friendly?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.546
Guess that answers that.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.210
No. Come on. This way.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.879
There you go.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.886
They're better with
a bit of milk, actually.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.016
I'm gonna get this out.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.933
You're not a very good thief,
by the way.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.474
Next time, try and be a bit quieter.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.608
That's the trick, I hear.
Come on.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.187
Up you come. Look.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.398
Look at that.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.374
There's gonna be a family
worried about you.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.164
You'd better go home now.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.297
No, no, no.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.507
This way.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.047
I know. But I think it's time,
you'd better go home.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.262
Hey, no, this way. There you go.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.514
Go on. Go out there.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.309
That's it. Go on.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.068
No, don't look at me like that, okay?

17:00.520 --> 17:01.942
All right, then.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.986
One night, okay?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.612
And then I'm gonna
take you back to your owner.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.660
Yeah, deal?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.414
There you go.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.796
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.433
Over there?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.359
Excuse me.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.155
Did you lose a cat?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.576
Is it there?

19:12.735 --> 19:13.827
No?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.539
Excuse me?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.955
Did you lose a cat?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.118
Hello?

19:26.248 --> 19:29.377
I've got a little ginger cat down here,
if anyone's looking for it.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.216
Hello?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.423
So, what number life are you on?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.059
Apparently, I'm on my ninth.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.638
Hello, did anybody lose a cat?

19:39.804 --> 19:42.432
- Get out of here! Go away!
- Thanks.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.066
Come on.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.895
There you go.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.691
Someone will come looking for you.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.027
Take care of yourself.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.117
Thank you.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.366
- Hi.
- Methadone, right?

20:29.937 --> 20:30.938
Thank you, mate.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.457
Not you again. Oi!

20:45.619 --> 20:48.042
- Come on, on your way.
- Don't do this, mate.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.253
You know the rules.
You're causing an obstruction.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.386
I'm just trying to make a living here.
I'm not in anyone's way.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.046
It's an health and safety issue.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.385
If you stand there,
you're obstructing the exit.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.300
Well, if you stand there, you are.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.720
- One toot on this, they'll haul you away.
- Right.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.015
- If it was up to me, I'd arrest the lot of you.
- I'm sure you would.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.185
Flippin' vermin.
As if we haven't got enough to do.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.941
Dad? Dad.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.195
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.697
We're...

21:18.068 --> 21:19.991
A little bit of shopping. This and that.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.665
- Oh, yeah.
- You good?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.747
Yeah. I've stopped using.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.538
- I'm in the program.
- Again?

21:30.039 --> 21:31.119
It won't be like last time.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.047
- I've got my own flat now, and everything.
- Jack.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.968
- You remember Hilary.
- Hi.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.801
We're late, darling.
I'm sorry, we've got to...

21:41.967 --> 21:44.436
We were just chatting
about Christmas, actually.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.644
Family and all that. Coming together.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.775
Christmas dinner. Right, Dad?

21:49.934 --> 21:53.154
Well, I wish we'd known.
Unfortunately, our table's full.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.485
Always room
for one more at Christmas. Right?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.946
Don't you think, darling?
Maybe one more would...

21:58.108 --> 22:00.327
What, in our house?
We'll have children there.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.074
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jack, we're late. Come on.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.993
I'm not contagious, you know.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.078
Take this.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.725
- No, I don't want your money.
- Here.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.503
Maybe...

22:13.666 --> 22:15.464
Maybe New Year's, okay?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.711
Darling. Hold up.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.464
Hey, wait up.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.632
Yeah.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.892
Hey, mate.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.279
Hey, boy.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.236
It's okay.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.152
You're hurt.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.161
What have you been doing today?

22:45.531 --> 22:47.374
Have you been in a fight?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.621
Is it okay if I take you
and try and find your owner?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.209
Is that okay?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.211
It's okay.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.262
Here, down here?

23:02.047 --> 23:04.800
Excuse me.
Do you know whose cat this is?

23:05.259 --> 23:07.557
Wait, I have a hurt cat here.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.480
It's you, with the dogs.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.275
Yeah, it's just in there.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.560
What did you do to it?

23:14.727 --> 23:17.276
Me? I didn't do anything.
I just found him over there.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.108
Don't just stand there.

23:30.326 --> 23:31.999
It's all right.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.261
- It's okay, it's okay.
- There you go.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.519
There we go.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.022
Yeah, it might be purulent.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.942
- It might be what?
- The wound.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.102
He needs antibiotics before it's infected.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.607
Maybe they can glue it together.
He needs a vet.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.532
That sounds expensive.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.160
Can you put a price on love?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.571
No, no. He's not my cat.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.160
I just found him.
I think he's a stray or...

24:09.323 --> 24:11.872
- I don't know.
- Well...

24:12.201 --> 24:15.580
He is telling me
he was put hereto be with you.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.833
Reading his spirit loud and clear.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.005
He came to you for a reason.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.965
Really? You're sensing that?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.927
Of course not. What do I look like,
some kind of nut?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.933
There's a card there
for the vet that I volunteer at.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.393
It's a charity.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.104
- Tell them Betty sent you.
- Okay, thanks.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.859
And you are?

24:38.018 --> 24:40.066
Me? I'm James.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.481
James Bowen.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.070
I don't believe in last names.
Patriarchal burdens.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.287
I gotta go. I've got dogs to walk.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.698
Right, yeah.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.285
Okay, mate. It's all right.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Allergic. Animals.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.249
- Ironic, huh?
- Yeah.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.625
You should go.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.052
Bacteria's multiplying by the second...

25:04.211 --> 25:05.884
...and Bob needs a vet.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.172
Bob?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.512
That's what he told me
he wants you to call him.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.474
It's okay.
He's not actually my cat, you know.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.513
Mine, yours.
We all belong to each other.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.023
See you, Bob!

25:16.515 --> 25:17.641
It was nice to meet you.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.440
You're a bit of an attention hog.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.563
Do you know that, Bob?

25:28.485 --> 25:30.112
It's okay. I got you.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.215
Hi there.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.006
I just found this cat,
and he's hurt himself.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.675
A stray?

25:50.841 --> 25:52.013
I don't know.

25:52.176 --> 25:55.055
- Are you asking us to put him down?
- What? No.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.064
You know how many stray cats
are in London? It's an epidemic.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.021
Well, he's got a name. It's Bob.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.028
And the wound, it's purulent.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.897
Take a number.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.825
It's gonna be a long wait.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.110
I've gotta be somewhere.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.245
Can't I drop him off and come back?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.202
Does this look like a dry-cleaner's?

26:20.412 --> 26:21.959
Okay, okay.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.049
It's okay, it's okay.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.510
It's okay.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.438
Look. It's a rabbit.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.812
No, no, no.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.936
Don't look at the rabbit.
The rabbit's not for dinner, okay?

26:47.981 --> 26:50.325
Don't worry about him, Bob.
It's okay.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.833
Bob, look, it's the month of the cat.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.296
Yeah.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.967
That's the kind of hat for you, isn't it?

27:12.005 --> 27:15.100
Look at Tiffany. She looks cute.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.811
Who's that? Look at that one.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.472
Lucky. Look at Lucky.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.932
Doesn't look so lucky, does he?

27:27.146 --> 27:30.025
I've missed my appointment.
Val's gonna kill me.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.818
I can't miss rush-hour busking.
I've gotta go, all right?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.238
I'll have to come back tomorrow.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.240
Number 62 is up.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.119
It's okay. It's okay.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.129
Hi.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.749
- He did great.
- You okay?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.636
Yeah? Come on, then, mister.
In you get.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.796
- That's it. Good boy.
- Okay.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.388
- You get your pills from the front desk.
- Okay.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.640
22 pounds.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.560
I thought she said
this place was free.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.975
Not the drugs.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.028
Sorry, mate.

28:08.812 --> 28:09.813
Hang on.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.610
That's all I've got.
Come on, he's really sick.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.199
All right, wait.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.623
- This is my food money for the next week.
- It's up to you.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.836
Right. Come on, Bob.

28:32.002 --> 28:35.097
Time for your medicine.
This is gonna make you feel better.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.678
Look, what's that? Yeah, exactly.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.677
All right, ready?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.516
Open wide.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.396
No, no, no, no. Come here.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.061
Bob, look.
Yeah. Just down the hatch, mate.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.021
Oi. Come back here, mister.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.189
Come here.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.735
Come here, oi. Hey.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.032
No, Bob.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.243
Bob!

29:03.825 --> 29:06.453
Right. Okay.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.378
Bob. Treat.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.714
Right, mister.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.967
Let's try this again.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.854
Twice a day for two weeks, they said.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.889
No, come here.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.228
All right.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.730
No, no, no. Stay here, stay here.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.938
Stay here. Bob, Bob, Bob.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.903
Oi! Come here, come here.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.317
Wait, come here.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.611
Look, what's that?
What's that? What's that?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.620
What's that? What's that?

29:40.779 --> 29:41.780
Bob!

29:44.116 --> 29:45.993
It's all right, mate. It's okay.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.453
I know.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.497
I swear he wasn't like this earlier.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.257
Well, I've had practice.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.760
Did they tell you to bring him back
in a couple of weeks?

29:56.211 --> 29:58.930
Yeah, that'll be a good time
to get him snipped.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.597
- "Snipped"?
- Yeah, the man parts.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.269
- But, I mean...
- Please, it isn't a big deal.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.980
It's easy for you to say.
Besides, he's not even mine.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.612
An intact male alone on the streets,
it's the worst life imaginable.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.569
They fight for food,
they fight for territory.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.325
Don't need to imagine that, do we?

30:18.483 --> 30:21.783
If you can't give him a home,
at least give him a chance to stay alive.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.913
Now, ordinarily, I don't touch meat...

30:24.072 --> 30:26.120
...but Bob's gonna need some protein.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.375
What do you do?
How did you end up here?

30:30.537 --> 30:33.586
- Me?
- Well, I know what he does.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.959
- What have you got there?
- Allergy pill.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.173
Right. I thought...

30:37.336 --> 30:39.384
Otherwise, I am 100 percent anti-drug.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.923
Lot of addicts in here.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.260
I steer clear.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.350
So, what do you do?
How did you end up here?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.765
I'm a musician.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.524
- I write songs and play.
- Yeah?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.194
I haven't exactly been discovered yet...

30:54.686 --> 30:56.939
...but I just moved in here, which is good.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.732
From... Australia.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.111
I've actually been back a while.

31:02.986 --> 31:07.287
I've been sort of in between places,
I guess you could say.

31:07.449 --> 31:11.079
But no, I got taken out there when
I was a kid when my parents split up.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.123
And my mum took me out there,
and Dad stayed here.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.792
He had his business to run...

31:16.958 --> 31:19.711
- ...and didn't like flying, apparently.
- And you?

31:22.130 --> 31:23.347
Well...

31:24.299 --> 31:26.518
...she bought me a kitten, actually.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.513
Dad, kitten. Kitten, Dad.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.022
You must have missed him.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.478
My dad?

31:32.641 --> 31:34.143
It's a long story.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.357
Long story, eh?

31:37.354 --> 31:39.732
Val, I'm so sorry I missed our time.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.617
Honestly, I tried to get there.
There were things...

31:42.776 --> 31:45.074
- There was this cat, right?
- We have an agreement.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.992
- You miss your appointment, you're out.
- And I met this girl, Betty.

31:49.366 --> 31:52.961
I'm waiting for the part that explains
why you missed our appointment.

31:53.703 --> 31:54.955
Is that blood on your coat?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.758
- Must be Bob's.
- Who's Bob?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.634
Bob's my cat I'm telling you about.

31:59.793 --> 32:00.885
Well, not really mine.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.138
- Betty's?
- No.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.181
Betty's allergic.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.559
But she told me to take him to the vet.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.602
You seem a little rattled.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.031
I'm trying to explain to you
why I missed our appointment.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.932
Bob was hurt. He needed a vet.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.397
- It took forever.
- How'd you pay for the vet?

32:18.478 --> 32:20.606
My dad gave me some money.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.024
You saw your dad?

32:22.190 --> 32:25.034
Yeah. Bumped into him.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.617
It didn't go very well.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.871
This Betty...

32:29.030 --> 32:30.373
...does she use?

32:30.699 --> 32:31.871
No.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.499
I put myself on the line for you.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.214
- I know.
- Did you tell her you're in the program?

32:38.832 --> 32:41.927
- I told her I was a musician.
- So you didn't tell her the truth.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.594
Well...

32:46.756 --> 32:49.509
...you've covered a lot of ground
since I last saw you.

32:49.843 --> 32:53.063
- You can't take on too much too fast.
- Because I'm an emotional wreck?

32:53.221 --> 32:55.349
Because feelings
aren't an addict's friend.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.938
Bad, good, any feelings.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.570
When was the last time
you were totally sober?

33:00.729 --> 33:03.323
No weed, no brown, nothing.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.193
When my parents split up, and I was...

33:06.359 --> 33:08.487
You just couldn't deal with
your emotions.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.621
Emotions are still dangerous.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.284
It's baby steps, James.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.749
You're not ready for a relationship.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.420
Another one?

34:04.751 --> 34:07.755
You wanna go up high?
Wanna go up high?

34:07.921 --> 34:09.514
Go on, Bob.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.050
Good boy.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.344
You've got your strength back.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.650
Hey.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.562
Here he is.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.110
Look at your collar.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.572
Look at you. You're like
Shakespeare or something.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.578
He's a little drowsy,
but the castration went well.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.364
Please, don't even say the word.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.078
I think he understands English.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.708
Here you go.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.128
It's okay. Does he hurt down there?

34:40.286 --> 34:41.630
You big wally.

34:41.788 --> 34:44.041
Do you know how many cats
we castrate every...

34:44.456 --> 34:46.458
Perform the procedure on?

34:46.751 --> 34:48.628
He won't even remember.
Will you, Bob?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.172
Yeah, I don't know about that.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.138
You know, I was thinking, is he too thin?

34:54.884 --> 34:56.386
You're keeping him, aren't you?

34:56.553 --> 34:58.146
Well, I'd like to...

34:58.305 --> 35:00.854
...but I can't. It wouldn't
be fair to him, would it?

35:01.266 --> 35:03.769
Keep him cooped up all day?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.277
He's a street cat.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.690
His weight's fine.
He should be good to go in a week.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.282
Okay.

35:10.734 --> 35:11.986
Thank you.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.667
Oi. I know, I know.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.462
No, don't look at me like that.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.713
It's for your own good.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.799
Hey. It wasn't my idea.
You can take it up with Betty.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.759
Okay, look.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.800
I'll take that off if you promise
not to lick the stitches.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.263
Okay?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.678
Right. No, it's okay.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.940
Now, you hold still there, okay?

35:42.098 --> 35:43.600
Okay, Bob.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.735
Let me just take this off.
Okay, that's it.

35:45.894 --> 35:49.114
That is a good boy.
Okay, here we go. There you go.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.783
Hey, look at this.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.240
Come on.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.831
See, there you go.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.957
Yeah, I'm your hero now.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.498
You wait till you realize
you've got no bits left.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.569
Morning, mate.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.593
No, no, no, Bob!

37:35.378 --> 37:37.096
Bob, Bob, Bob. No.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.132
Naughty.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.885
Do I not feed you enough?

37:42.635 --> 37:45.809
You only eat what I give you, yeah?

37:46.181 --> 37:48.024
Not the neighbors.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.184
And you...

37:50.393 --> 37:51.940
...don't come back.

38:10.747 --> 38:14.593
No, look, Bob. Bob.
I've gotta go to work, all right?

38:15.043 --> 38:16.465
I can't take care of you.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.096
I wish I could...

38:18.421 --> 38:20.344
...but I can't.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.477
Look at the big world out there
waiting for you.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.850
Go and explore it.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.935
That's it. Good boy.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.444
So long, Bob.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.625
Come on. This is silly now.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.631
What did I just say?
You're gonna get yourself run over.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.584
Hey, it's not safe out here.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.469
I mean it.
You can't come with me.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.345
Seriously, you'd be surprised
how much he understands.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.134
Hey, Bob.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.302
Go on, go back to the grass.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.314
Go on. Good boy.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.850
Good boy.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.368
Darling, look.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.223
What are you doing here?
Hey, no, don't go over there.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.009
He's not even my cat.
He's just followed me onto the bus.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.893
Haven't you, eh?

39:49.512 --> 39:52.607
- Isn't he lovely?
- Is it okay that he's on here?

39:52.765 --> 39:55.234
- I don't know. Have you paid for him?
- Two for one?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.734
Hey, do you wanna go up here?

39:59.898 --> 40:01.525
There you go.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.111
That's a good view.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.654
Yeah.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.662
What are you doing,
following me into town, hey?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.086
Hey, Bob, look.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.336
Look at those, eh?

40:21.502 --> 40:24.301
Yeah, you're a lion. You're a lion.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.641
Yeah.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.843
They've got nothing on you, mate.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.351
- Here. Would this help, love?
- That's perfect.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.895
- That's good. It's a bit thicker.
- Yeah.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.110
- Not too tight, now.
- No, I know.

40:41.314 --> 40:44.614
It's just if he gets spooked in town.
I don't want him to run off.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.653
He's not actually mine. He's a stray.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.868
- He doesn't look like a stray to me.
- Yeah, I know.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.717
Good boy.

41:07.256 --> 41:10.726
Come on.
Come on, Bob. This way.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.559
We won't make any money here, mate.
Come on, this way.

41:13.721 --> 41:14.722
Good boy.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.311
On we go.

41:17.767 --> 41:18.768
Bob, Bob, Bob!

41:19.227 --> 41:20.399
Sorry.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.280
Good boy. That's enough shopping
for one day.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.320
Bob. Come on.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.487
Come on.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.453
I'll tell you what.
You jump up here, okay?

41:34.033 --> 41:35.831
We haven't got all day. Come on.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.250
Good boy.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.539
Is that better up there?

41:40.915 --> 41:42.462
This is Covent Garden.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.219
You okay, Bob?

41:46.546 --> 41:48.048
Look at his cat!

41:48.506 --> 41:50.429
- I could eat you up!
- She doesn't mean it.

41:50.967 --> 41:51.968
He's gorgeous.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.387
Thank you.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.564
Look at that.
I'd like to see you do that.

41:57.265 --> 41:58.312
- Hey!
- Hi.

41:58.474 --> 42:00.476
- Can I have a photo?
- Yeah, okay. Sure.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.270
Say cheese, Bob.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.481
- All right?
- Thanks!

42:11.904 --> 42:14.327
You're quite the little party piece,
aren't you?

42:15.366 --> 42:17.243
Look, it's so cute!

42:17.410 --> 42:18.536
It's a cat!

42:18.703 --> 42:19.750
Hi.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.460
Wanna say hello?

42:22.081 --> 42:25.506
We're playing now over there
so if you wanna come and watch, then...

42:25.668 --> 42:26.965
- You want to?
- Yeah!

42:29.130 --> 42:31.303
Good work, getting the punters in.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.318
High-five. Hey, high-five.

44:16.112 --> 44:17.614
Do you know what just happened?

44:18.239 --> 44:19.707
Look at this!

44:20.908 --> 44:23.411
You are a wonderful little being,
aren't you?

44:25.037 --> 44:27.165
Got yourself a lovely ginger, all right.

44:27.748 --> 44:28.749
Yeah.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.840
I had a ginger tom just like him once.

44:32.253 --> 44:33.880
Loved him with all me heart.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.219
- He's got a mind of his own.
- That's the point.

44:36.382 --> 44:39.101
The gingers, got wills like iron,
they have.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.558
Mine wouldn't leave my side
till his last breath.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.353
You got yourself
a lifelong partner there.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.563
Better friends than people, they are.

44:46.893 --> 44:48.361
Believe me.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.782
Is that right, Bob? Good boy.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.666
Hey, mister.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.006
You have put in a shift today,
haven't you?

45:18.299 --> 45:20.552
Yeah. You wanna come again tomorrow?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.220
The bright lights?

45:22.762 --> 45:24.105
Here, look.

45:24.639 --> 45:25.731
This could be you, Bob.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.358
Your name in lights. Look.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.033
You wanna get some food
when we get home?

45:44.909 --> 45:47.003
Dinner is served.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.293
You played a blinder.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.259
There you go.

46:00.675 --> 46:01.722
Bob.

46:03.052 --> 46:04.224
Bob!

46:04.762 --> 46:07.891
Yeah, you're gonna be a professional
cat-harness wearer now.

46:08.683 --> 46:10.401
What do you think about that?

46:23.698 --> 46:25.541
Hello, stranger.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.411
- Hi.
- Haven't seen you around.

46:28.577 --> 46:29.954
What's with the sign?

46:30.413 --> 46:32.757
I'm going on a march
to free farmed animals.

46:32.915 --> 46:33.962
Free what?

46:34.125 --> 46:35.593
Cows, pigs, chickens.

46:35.751 --> 46:36.843
Turkeys.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.846
You want them
just running in the street?

46:40.506 --> 46:43.106
We want them not to be murdered.
Don't tell me you're a carnivore.

46:43.843 --> 46:45.470
I've never really thought about it.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.934
Well, think about it.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.691
Every bite you take,
you're eating suffering.

46:50.850 --> 46:52.523
Living all posh now, huh?

46:52.685 --> 46:53.937
Off the streets and all?

46:54.103 --> 46:55.776
What are you doing here?

46:56.439 --> 46:58.862
I just thought
I'd follow a friendly face.

46:59.025 --> 47:01.744
I thought maybe I could
crash with you for a bit, you know.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.284
Spread the wealth about a bit.

47:04.447 --> 47:07.496
- Hello, kitty.
- Hey! Go away, Baz, all right?

47:07.658 --> 47:09.205
I mean it.

47:09.452 --> 47:10.624
Come on, anything.

47:10.911 --> 47:13.255
I had a bit of hard lines, man.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.626
James, please.

47:16.834 --> 47:17.835
Please, James.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.504
Look at you.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.796
All right...

47:21.464 --> 47:24.308
- This is for food, Baz. All right?
- Promise. Yeah, for food.

47:24.467 --> 47:25.810
- Please promise me.
- Honestly.

47:25.968 --> 47:27.390
- Yeah, I promise.
- I mean it.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.478
You need to
look after yourself, all right?

47:31.640 --> 47:34.985
- Please, Baz, just buy some food.
- I promise. I swear.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.190
And don't come back here, all right?

47:42.360 --> 47:44.112
Nice cat.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.547
Thank you.

48:21.273 --> 48:22.399
Thank you very much.

48:23.359 --> 48:26.283
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Brilliant.

48:26.445 --> 48:28.573
- Hi.
- I hope you don't mind...

48:28.739 --> 48:30.958
...I got Bob a little something
for Christmas.

48:32.618 --> 48:34.916
Look at that, Bob!
You want a bit of that?

48:35.079 --> 48:38.674
- And I made him a little something.
- You shouldn't have.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.801
Thank you. Look at that!

48:40.960 --> 48:42.758
- I think he likes it.
- Thank you so much.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.843
- You're an angel.
- I wouldn't go that far.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.928
I wasn't always a little old lady.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.554
Thank you.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.769
Look at that, Bob.
You're gonna have that later.

48:57.560 --> 48:58.777
Hi, Betty.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.233
Look at Bob.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.698
Doctor Who's twin.

49:02.857 --> 49:03.858
Love the scarf.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.618
- Yeah. Just got it.
- You all right? You look tired.

49:06.986 --> 49:09.535
I've been busy. Or rather, he has.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.745
I've been demoted to sidekick.

49:12.825 --> 49:14.827
I'm starving. Can I cook you dinner?

49:15.202 --> 49:16.203
Anything...

49:16.370 --> 49:17.792
...as long as it's tuna.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.798
I'm level four. Vegan.

49:20.916 --> 49:24.546
- I have no idea what you just said.
- I don't eat anything that casts a shadow.

49:24.712 --> 49:26.760
You don't get shadows underwater,
do you?

49:27.965 --> 49:30.059
How about this,
I will cook you dinner.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.761
If you give me an hour.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.053
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:33.220 --> 49:36.269
- Okay. An hour. No more, no less.
- Okay.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.694
I think this is a date, Bob.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.732
So who did all these paintings?

49:43.898 --> 49:46.026
Only the most talented painter I know.

49:46.692 --> 49:50.413
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Steamed seitan with miso.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.043
- Just eat it. It's good for you.
- Yeah.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.872
I'm actually painting my flat as well.

50:00.039 --> 50:02.838
Maybe not quite like this, but...

50:03.250 --> 50:04.752
I can see.

50:08.631 --> 50:09.883
I just bloody bought this.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.343
I've got some turps in the kitchen
if you want.

50:12.510 --> 50:13.557
Thanks.

50:13.719 --> 50:16.142
Painting, buying. Life must be good.

50:16.305 --> 50:19.900
Feels like I'm joining the real world
after all these years, you know?

50:20.893 --> 50:23.442
- Meaning?
- Just...

50:23.854 --> 50:25.948
You know I said
about my parents splitting up?

50:26.106 --> 50:27.824
I just got moved around a lot and...

50:27.983 --> 50:31.408
You went off the rails a bit?
A little angry, a little wild?

50:32.154 --> 50:34.156
Yeah, you could say that.

50:34.740 --> 50:37.289
But, anyway, what about you?

50:38.118 --> 50:39.415
More wine?

50:40.079 --> 50:41.501
Thank you.

50:47.086 --> 50:50.260
All right. We need some real food, Bob.
What's it gonna be?

50:51.048 --> 50:52.265
Want some hot dogs?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.806
No? Okay.

50:55.928 --> 50:58.602
Right, so, what do you fancy?

50:58.764 --> 51:00.482
Wild Pacific pink salmon?

51:02.309 --> 51:04.983
Is that a yes?
Okay, we'll get one of them.

51:05.354 --> 51:06.446
What else?

51:06.772 --> 51:07.819
Some tuna?

51:07.982 --> 51:09.154
Yeah?

51:09.316 --> 51:11.239
Yeah. That's a yes for that as well.

51:11.402 --> 51:13.200
What else?

51:14.363 --> 51:16.491
Boneless sardines?

51:17.074 --> 51:19.202
Yeah, you want that, don't you?

51:20.077 --> 51:22.250
Okay. That's good.

51:22.663 --> 51:26.338
Salmon, tuna, sardines. Good to go?

51:26.834 --> 51:28.006
All right.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.508
We are gonna eat
like kings tomorrow, Bob.

51:36.218 --> 51:37.640
I'll tell you what.

51:40.639 --> 51:42.516
- We'll get these as well.
- Of course.

51:42.725 --> 51:43.977
Like them?

51:45.311 --> 51:47.234
Bob. They're for Betty.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.782
Thank you, Bob.

51:59.992 --> 52:00.993
Hello?

52:04.038 --> 52:05.415
Hello?

52:09.752 --> 52:13.222
Oh, no. Please. Bob, down.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.849
Baz. Baz, wake up.

52:16.008 --> 52:18.477
Wake up, Baz. Wake up!
Come on, wake up.

52:18.636 --> 52:21.059
Baz? Hello? Wake up.
Can you hear me?

52:21.221 --> 52:23.724
Baz. Wake up.
Can somebody call an ambulance?

52:24.516 --> 52:26.564
No, Bob, get away from that.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.900
Hey, Baz. Come on.

52:29.063 --> 52:31.441
Wake up.
Help! Call an ambulance!

52:31.607 --> 52:34.736
- They're on the way!
- Baz, listen to me. Come on.

52:34.902 --> 52:35.949
James!

52:36.320 --> 52:38.664
- Has he OD'd?
- Yeah.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.540
- Have you checked his airways?
- No.

52:40.699 --> 52:41.825
Help me get him back.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.327
Okay, come on.

52:44.036 --> 52:45.333
Is he breathing?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.169
Baz, come on!

52:47.331 --> 52:48.583
Come on, Baz, wake up.

52:54.046 --> 52:55.047
Come on, come on!

52:55.214 --> 52:56.511
- He's OD'd.
- What's his name?

52:56.674 --> 52:58.472
- Baz.
- Hello, Baz, can you hear me?

52:58.634 --> 53:00.978
- You know what he's taken?
- Heroin, heroin.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.765
How old is he, do you know?

53:04.932 --> 53:07.060
- He's, like, 20.
- Baz, can you hear me?

53:07.226 --> 53:09.274
What have we got,
he's in respiratory arrest.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.154
It's okay, Bob. It's okay.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.819
One, two, three, lift.

53:12.981 --> 53:15.200
Move back, please, move back!

53:16.443 --> 53:18.116
Give us some room.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.999
I know a bit about addicts.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.039
I was in Sheffield...

53:28.539 --> 53:30.507
...studying a veterinary course.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.590
My parents didn't call.

53:34.044 --> 53:36.263
They drove up and told me.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.641
My brother was everything to me.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.472
Protector, teacher.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.811
He was the best painter I ever knew.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.226
This was your...

53:48.642 --> 53:50.644
Your brother's place.

53:52.813 --> 53:55.532
He died right back there
in the bathroom...

53:56.525 --> 53:58.698
...needle still in his arm.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.325
Twenty-eight.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.829
- So why did you...?
- Move in here?

54:05.784 --> 54:07.331
To be near him.

54:09.121 --> 54:11.590
He tried...

54:11.749 --> 54:14.468
...so hard, to get clean.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.714
But I guess that
he didn't want it enough.

54:19.965 --> 54:23.060
Or could want it enough.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.892
But he couldn't do it...

54:26.847 --> 54:28.394
...not even for me.

54:35.147 --> 54:36.569
I thought you wanted clean.

54:36.732 --> 54:38.029
I do. God, of course I do.

54:38.192 --> 54:39.409
Then why not now?

54:39.568 --> 54:42.071
I'm ready to come off the methadone.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.238
It's a process, James.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.703
It's my job to manage
the process with you.

54:46.450 --> 54:47.952
I'm down to 10 ml.

54:48.118 --> 54:51.918
Let's revisit this after the holidays.
God knows they're hard enough as it is.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.587
Hey, you're doing great.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.548
I just... I want...

54:56.710 --> 55:00.260
I wanna be clean.
I want to live a life, you know?

55:00.881 --> 55:03.885
This kid I knew, Baz...

55:04.593 --> 55:05.594
He...

55:06.845 --> 55:09.268
He OD'd. He died.

55:10.599 --> 55:12.192
And I don't wanna go that way.

55:12.351 --> 55:13.773
I know.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.688
After the holidays.

55:16.647 --> 55:17.739
Yeah?

55:20.692 --> 55:22.490
Look, I've got another appointment.

55:23.362 --> 55:24.363
Okay.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.282
Hey, no.

55:27.908 --> 55:29.000
Come on.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.013
- What are you doing for Christmas?
- Betty said she'd spend it with me...

55:32.037 --> 55:35.667
...as long as I didn't mention the words
"Christmas" or "merry" in any order.

55:35.833 --> 55:36.834
My kind of girl.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.469
Ho, ho, ho, Happy Cats-mas!

55:39.628 --> 55:41.972
- What's all this?
- Happy Cats-mas, Bob.

55:42.130 --> 55:44.428
New girlfriend for you.
This is Bobina.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.643
- He's not impressed.
- Sorry.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.780
- He will. Just playing hard to get.
- Don't panic, by the way.

55:48.804 --> 55:52.525
This isn't a you-know-what tree.
No, it's a lamp tree.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.315
Taste like turkey?

55:59.606 --> 56:01.574
- Not even vaguely.
- It does!

56:01.733 --> 56:03.406
- Tastes like rubber.
- No, it doesn't!

56:03.569 --> 56:06.914
It's nice, but what I think is
that if you're gonna eat tofu...

56:07.072 --> 56:10.201
...why pretend it's turkey,
or burgers or whatever?

56:10.367 --> 56:12.415
It's like giving tofu
an inferiority complex.

56:12.578 --> 56:14.251
Let it be who it wants to be.

56:14.413 --> 56:15.835
"I am tofu.

56:15.998 --> 56:17.591
I am inedible."

56:17.749 --> 56:19.797
- It's not inedible!
- No.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.303
- Give it to Bob to try.
- Okay.

56:21.461 --> 56:23.930
- He's a better judge than you.
- Bob? What's that?

56:25.048 --> 56:26.345
What's that?

56:30.512 --> 56:32.389
I think we'll take that as a "no."

56:37.811 --> 56:39.188
I love it!

56:39.354 --> 56:41.698
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.700
Right, so I'll read this to you, mate.

56:47.863 --> 56:48.864
Look.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.749
"Dear James and Boblet...

56:50.908 --> 56:53.286
...happy Cat-mas.
Lots of purrs and whiskers.

56:53.452 --> 56:54.704
From Betty."

56:55.662 --> 56:56.834
Good, right?

56:56.997 --> 56:57.998
Thank you.

57:01.168 --> 57:02.590
Is this one of your brother's?

57:02.753 --> 57:03.754
Yeah.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.173
And it's just out...

57:05.339 --> 57:06.682
Yeah, just out there.

57:07.299 --> 57:11.054
Betty, that is so beautiful.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.435
Come on.

58:00.769 --> 58:02.988
- No. No, I can't sing.
- Yes you can.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.362
It's awful. Horrible.

58:06.525 --> 58:07.572
Come on.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.786
Bob!

58:14.199 --> 58:16.827
I don't know. Is it crazy?

58:17.577 --> 58:20.956
What, surprising your dad
and his new family on New Year's Eve...

58:21.123 --> 58:24.423
...when they've given no indication
that they want you there?

58:24.584 --> 58:26.712
Yeah, well, when you put it like that...

58:27.087 --> 58:30.341
But he didn't exactly say
I couldn't come.

58:30.507 --> 58:33.556
And, I don't know, things have been
going pretty good lately.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.026
Do you ever wonder
why people kiss with their lips?

58:49.192 --> 58:50.990
I mean, why not...

58:51.153 --> 58:54.373
...rub ears like, "I want to hear you."

58:56.033 --> 58:58.035
Or wrists, like this.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.898
Hey, you did way too many threes!
And there's not even a seven on the dice.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.061
- You cheated. You have to go back.
- If you cheat, I get an extra card!

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.321
That's cheating.
You've gotta put that back.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:10.358
Can't you play quietly? Come on.
Have you cleaned your teeth?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:14.995
- You can't cheat! That's cheating!
- Oh, come on! For goodness' sake.

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:16.746
Happy families, eh, Bob?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.499
All right, come on. We've got this far.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.418
Girls! Come and clean this up.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:23.203
You know what?

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.542
Let's put you under here.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:27.457
- Girls, they'll be here in a minute.
- Two surprise guests...

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.844
...might be more than they can handle.
No, come on. Come on.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.345
Good boy.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.723
There's the door now. All right!

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.056
Happy New Year.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.648
Thanks.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.186
How are you doing? All right?

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.729
Nice house.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.233
- Hi, kids.
- Girls, you remember your brother.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.234
Pris, Faith, this is James.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.950
You've grown up so much
since I last saw you.

01:00:57.112 --> 01:01:00.616
What were you playing in there?
Dad and I used to play Trivial Pursuit.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:01.783
- You remember?
- Yes.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.887
You let me play the adult version
that weekend before I left for Melbourne.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.003
- Did I?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.164
She was cheating.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.673
And Mummy doesn't like you.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.175
Mummy says you're a junkie.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.836
- I didn't cheat, you cheated.
- Did not, you cheated!

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.097
- She says I'm a junkie.
- Stop it, girls!

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.383
- Where did she get that idea from?
- Stop it.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.068
You can't be here.
We've got guests coming.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.528
Girls! Mummy will be down in a minute.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:21.988
I thought you said
New Year's would be okay.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.265
I said "maybe."
You should have called.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.308
He's a junkie. He's a junkie.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.244
- Will you leave the tree alone?
- James is a junkie!

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.895
A recovering addict, actually.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:32.822
- Daddy, he's got a cat!
- What the hell?

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.699
Hey, kids, meet Bob.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:38.742
Hey, hey hey! Bob! Bob!

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.115
- Pris, leave it!
- Come here, Bob.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.750
- Faith, stop screaming!
- Jack, what is going on?

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.126
They're coming at 8:00.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.502
It's James.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.629
Hey, Hilary. Happy New Year. Bob.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:53.043
- What's he doing here? Faith.
- Mummy, Mummy! He's got a cat!

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.133
- But she's allergic!
- I know!

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.547
Bob!

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.816
- Pris, stop chasing...
- Get that thing out of here!

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.763
- She'll have an attack.
- I'm trying.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.849
- James, please.
- Come on, Bob. Come on.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:06.106
- Come here. Bob, come on, mate.
- For goodness' sake, James.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.891
- Bob!
- No!

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.401
That was my mother's.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.860
I know.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.867
Bob. Bob. I'm so sorry.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:19.653
- Get out of my house!
- Bob!

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.163
- You and your creature, just get out!
- Come on.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.121
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.461
Okay, come on. It's okay.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.213
- Calm down.
- How did he get in?

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.087
He's my son. You think I'd
close the door in his face?

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.769
- What have I told you!
- Let's get your lead on.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.215
- What?
- Don't let him in!

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.630
I want to stroke him.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.804
- Can I?
- Yeah, you can try.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.970
- He's so cute.
- When he's here everything goes wrong!

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.021
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.267
- I want a kitten.
- He's never allowed into this house!

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.485
My friend Sammy has a kitten.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.237
Make sure he's out of here!

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.273
Happy New Year, Dad.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.553
Thanks.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.197
Nice to see you again.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.723
Cats are weird.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.932
Go on, right there.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.226
- That's it. Go on.
- Hey!

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.521
- Piss off, you moron!
- Looks more like "piss on" to me.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.406
Get that dog away from here.
I'm trying to play here. Come on.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:22.276
- Come on.
- What?

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:24.945
- Don't touch me.
- Can you get that person out of here?

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:29.499
- It's all right, Bob. It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Shut up!

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.457
Oi, back off! Back off!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.333
I've got a cat under here!

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.382
Oi! Oi! That's enough!

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.087
- Give it up!
- Hey!

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.422
It's him, it's not me!

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.007
The dog needed a piss.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.923
It's your fault! It's that dog!
I've got a cat in here!

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.262
CCTV proved it wasn't your fault.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.726
But you're prohibited from busking
for six months.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.015
I said where's Bob?

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.452
Do you want to thank me for
coming down here and bailing you out?

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:59.150
Maybe you can focus.
You can't go back to Covent Garden.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.361
- You're banned from busking.
- I wanna know where my cat is!

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:05.244
- You missed your meds, didn't you?
- I just wanna know where Bob is.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:09.323
He's safe. He's in the police kennel.
We can go and get him right now.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.510
You got yourself arrested,
and you didn't get your methadone.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:13.751
James.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.082
You are so close.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.417
Don't lose it now.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.458
It wasn't my fault, none of this.
It wasn't my fault.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.046
I'm gonna call the chemist...

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.759
...authorize them to give it to you
even though you missed it yesterday.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:28.095
You go straight there. I'll get Bob. Okay?

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:33.980
Hello.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:36.492
If you fail to show up any day,
we can't give you the medication.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.269
But she called you, didn't she?
My key worker, she called?

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.858
I'm just warning you.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.230
Okay.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.066
- Sign.
- Yeah.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.157
Come on, man.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.680
- Let me explain!
- What's to explain? I have eyes, James.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.840
You're an addict. You lied to me!

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.304
No, I didn't!

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.186
- I just shaded the truth a little.
- Oh, please!

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.847
Wait, look! Okay, yeah,
I'm on the methadone program...

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:19.769
...but I haven't used for three months.
Believe me. I am trying to get clean.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.902
I can't be around addicts.
I told you that.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.029
It's just, it's too much...

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.859
I can't do it.
And I wasn't shading the truth.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:29.653
This dog came after Bob,
and I was trying to protect him.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.119
And then this whole fight broke out,
and then I got arrested.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.217
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
It wasn't my fault.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.915
Now I can't busk. If I do,
then I'll get arrested again.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:41.126
And then I don't know
what will even happen to Bob.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.383
If you can't sing,
you can't make any money.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.509
And if you do sing,
you'll get arrested.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.296
And all you're thinking about
is what happens to the cat!

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.235
<i>When you sell our magazine,
you get out what you put in.</i>

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.132
You know how they say
weed is a gateway drug?

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.384
Yeah, I'm a little familiar
with the concept.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.921
Well,<i> The Big Issue</i>
is a gateway opportunity.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:32.512
I'll start you off with a handful of
free ones. Just like a pusher, right?

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.722
You sell them, the next ones
you buy from us.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.728
Sell those, make a little profit,
buy even more.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:41.608
After a while, you get better territories,
work your way up, etcetera.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:43.768
Before you know it,
you're Rupert Murdock...

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.107
...except not a dickhead.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.443
If you can't sell them,
we don't buy them back.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:48.777
So you gotta plan.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.863
You get one designated territory. Get it?

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.823
Poach on anyone else,
and you're done.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.659
Period. Boom. Clear?

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.368
- Boom. Clear.
- Good.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.084
You can't have an animal in your photo.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.086
- This is your official ID.
- What animal?

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:04.373
I don't see an animal.
This is my co-pilot.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.212
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.717
Okay.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.092
Look this way.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.129
Say "cheese," Bob.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.256
You know what?

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.517
I might have just the right thing
for you two.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:18.303
It'll cost a tenner, but it's worth it.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:39.783
<i>Big Issue! Big Issue!</i>

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:43.920
<i>Big Issue!</i> Come on, guys! Give it a try!
Help Bob and I! <i>Big Issue!</i>

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:47.252
- Hey. <i>Big Issue?</i>
- Can I have a selfie with the cat?

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:50.339
You take a picture,
and then you buy a paper. How's that?

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:53.254
- Is that a deal?
- You are a good businessman. I like it.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.014
Come on, Bob, look at the camera.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.426
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.185
He wants to give you a high-five.
High-five, Bob.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:03.064
- High-five there.
- That's £2.50.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:05.395
I've only got £2.30. Is that all right?

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.606
- I can see that's £2.50.
- I'll owe it to you.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.237
- Excuse me, mate.
- Hey, mate.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.612
Hello. Peter Gruner.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.116
- I'm from the Islington Tribune.
- Thank you.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.274
Would you mind if I did a story
on you and the cat?

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:18.071
- Are you taking the mick?
- Can I pet him?

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:21.787
- You can try. Just behind the ears.
- See? You're a human interest story.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:23.292
- What's that?
- Would you mind?

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:25.537
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:27.376
Look this way, Bob.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:28.710
Bob, look over there.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.420
Bob! Lovely.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:33.553
- Let me get another one. Hang on.
<i>- Big Issue!</i>

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.008
<i>Big Issue.</i>

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.173
No, Bob cat. Bob cat.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.511
<i>Big Issue. Big Issue.</i>

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.142
<i>Big Issue.</i>

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:45.807
Bloody stupid cat.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.512
Hey, mate.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:17.718
Go screw yourself.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.508
Hey, watch your mouth.
I've got a minor here.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.265
Excuse me, sir.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.055
Sir! Sir.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.519
- Me?
- Can I take a picture of you and your cat?

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.901
- Please?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.110
It's okay, Bob. He likes your hat.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.401
- Great.
- Thank you. Can we buy a magazine?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.287
Sorry, it's not my patch.
You've got to speak to that guy.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:42.538
We really wanna help.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.074
- You can't...
- Thank you.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.334
- Have a great day.
- Okay. All right. And you.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.830
Come on, I wasn't poaching.
He knows I wasn't poaching.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.544
My patch, you're selling papers.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.334
- What else do you call it?
- Envy.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.219
- Envy? I'll envy your arse...
- Stop! Stop it!

01:10:57.378 --> 01:10:59.722
- James, you knew the rules.
- I wasn't selling...

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.133
One month, no papers.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.893
Come on! Don't do this.
I wasn't selling, I promise you.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.395
There was this one couple.
You saw what happened.

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.181
So they forced you to sell to them?

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.787
- I wasn't trying to...
- Look, you're taking business off me.

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.703
Why are you making this up?
Why are you picking on me?

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.821
- You took the money. Yeah?
- Enough. Enough.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.990
One month, no papers.

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.751
What?

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.131
Nothing.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.177
Just the chaos.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:43.592
Chaos around drug addicts?

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:46.053
Where life's a constant shit storm...

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.562
...that kind of chaos?

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:56.733
Bob, put the frog down.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.363
Leave it.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.003
One, two...

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:22.880
Thanks, there you go.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.236
I'll leave that one.
That's for the tuna. Thank you.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:45.445
Come on. There you go.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.413
You need this more than me.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.793
Thank you.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.084
Cheers.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.795
Thank you.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.588
Come on, Bob.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.092
Mate, there's nothing there.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.478
It's empty, mate.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.267
Bob...

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.488
Bob, stop it.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.572
Give it a rest, mate. Come on.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:11.656
Bob.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.747
Stop it!

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.338
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.918
I know. I know you're hungry, buddy.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.461
I'm sorry.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.383
I'll find a way, okay?

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.511
I'll find a way.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.648
James. What are you doing?

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:22.777
- Betty. Hi. I'm just...
- Wait, you've been banned from busking.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.687
Well, Bob's hungry, I'm hungry...

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:25.855
If you get arrested...

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.333
- ...you won't be able to feed Bob.
- They're not gonna arrest me here.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.576
What, do you think
you're just above the rules?

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:32.612
Like they don't apply to you?
So typical.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.122
- Typical of what, Betty?
- Stop it.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.283
- No, go on, say it. Let them hear.
- Stop it.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.386
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to eat?

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.708
- I don't know.
- What do you want me to do...

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.545
...just erase the last 20 years of my life
and start over?

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.708
I don't know!

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.092
I would if I could.

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:49.219
Do you know
who shouts like this in public?

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.723
Junkies do. And the people
who fall in love with them, that's who.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.053
I can't do this again.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.644
I didn't like it any more than you.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:06.358
Those are the rules.

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:09.031
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.657
James.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:12.276
Watch yourself, okay?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:13.868
Yeah.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.952
<i>Big Issue!</i>
Give it a try! Help Bob and I!

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.661
<i>Big Issue.</i> Come on.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:19.825
Yes, mate.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.535
Thank you very much.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.581
- He's adorable.
- This is Bob. You wanna say hello?

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.999
- Say hello.
- Hi!

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.838
- Yeah. Care for a <i>Big Issue,</i> madam?
- Oh, yes.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:33.677
- Actually, we came to see the cat.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.942
- Graham can't stop talking about him.
- Where's he from?

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:38.185
He's beautiful, isn't he? I found him.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.893
- Do you like Bob? £2.50, please.
- All right.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.649
- Yeah. He's my best mate.
- You want the best for him...

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.118
- There you go.
- ...all of that.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.644
Thank you very much. Of course.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.984
What I mean is,
I'd be willing to take him.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.773
Well, to buy him.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.820
- How much?
- He's not for sale.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.736
Obviously this isn't the
best environment for an animal...

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.997
- Please.
- ...living on the street and all.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.374
- Yes, all right, darling.
- We've got a flat...

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.661
We'd be able to give him
all the things you can't...

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.587
- ...like a decent home.
- He's not for sale.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.339
- I'm sure you could use cash.
- No, I don't want your money.

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:10.217
How about how much for your kid?
I'll trade you.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:12.504
- I'll give him a decent home.
- Excuse me?

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.968
How dare you.
That's exceptionally rude.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:18.263
Bob!

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:20.098
Hey! No!

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.603
Bob!

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:25.474
Come back!

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:29.562
Bob!

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.114
Bob!

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:39.997
Bob!

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.409
Bob!

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:45.999
Thank you so much.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.795
Excuse me,
did you see a cat here?

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.425
A ginger cat? No?

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:52.926
Bob!

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.220
Bob!

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:57.427
Bob!

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.467
Bob!

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.346
Bob.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:07.191
Come on, mate. Where are you?

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.566
Bob?

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.069
Bob?

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:18.612
What if a dog got him? Or a car, or...

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:22.615
I can't...

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:26.877
It's been two nights, you know.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.378
Look, I'm not saying this is it...

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.299
...but maybe Bob did
what he was meant to do.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:39.140
He's a cat.
Cats are independent animals.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.346
It's my own stupid fault.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.510
I wasn't watching him.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.224
You know,
I promised I'd take care of him...

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.935
...but I wasn't watching him.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.621
This isn't a time
you wanna be on your own.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:55.990
- What about your dad, or Betty?
- No, I need to...

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:59.281
I need to get home.
I need to wait for him there.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:01.988
Maybe he'll come back.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.715
I really think you should
have someone with you.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.332
He might come back, mightn't he?

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:06.868
He might do, yeah.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:08.536
He could come home, couldn't he?

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.210
James.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.828
I know these two.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.373
I used to see them all the time
when he was singing.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.882
But look at this.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.213
This guy and his cat
are all over YouTube.

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.377
Look at the hits.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:19:59.545
Over a million.

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.845
They're on Instagram.
And Facebook.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:05.717
That is so cute.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.515
Look at that.

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:10.306
- Incredible.
- So you're thinking a book?

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:48.639
You looking for paradise?

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:50.600
Because I've got it all here.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.733
White, brown, whatever you like.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.365
I want my cat.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:04.864
I'm looking for a ginger cat.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.950
Have you seen it anywhere?

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:11.916
Yeah.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:33.313
Bob! Bob!

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:35.098
Hey.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:36.892
Hey, mister.

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:39.441
Where have you been, hey?

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:41.071
Where have you been?

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.108
Oh, Bob.

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:50.122
Where have you been?

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:53.784
I'm ready.

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:56.290
I think you are, too.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:59.419
It's about weathering the tests, James.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.093
"Can I do it straight?"
That's always an addict's question.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.926
Think of the worst flu you've ever had.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:09.843
Multiply that by a hundred.
Do you know what "riding the bike" is?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:13.141
When you can't keep your legs still
even when you're lying down.

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:15.852
For a week, every day will be a fight.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:18.733
Every hour, a struggle
not to go out and score-.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:22.150
It's harder coming off methadone
than kicking heroin.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.314
You can't do it on your own.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.192
I'm not.

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:29.615
I've got him. He got me this far.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:34.124
The other day, we were selling papers,
and this guy came up to us.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.580
Really well-dressed...

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:38.791
...the sort that wouldn't wanna
share the pavement with me before.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:42.090
He called me "sir."

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:45.548
"Sir, do you mind
if I take your picture?"

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.681
No one's ever called me "sir" before.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.099
And it's because of Bob.

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:54.558
He's shown me what life could be like...

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.972
...on the other side.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.998
Betty?

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:26.969
I know you're in there.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.383
I just wanted to say you're not gonna
see me for a few days.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:34.517
Val's given me the go-ahead.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.475
So I'm doing it.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.646
I'm sorry that I've disappointed you.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:49.570
After all this...

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.656
...I'll make it up to you.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.827
I'll make it up to everyone I ever knew.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.209
I just wanted to let you know.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.678
You're gonna need food, a stockpile...

01:24:16.843 --> 01:24:20.143
...because any excuse to go outside,
and you're gonna try and score.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.558
Let me bring you the food.
Then lock the door.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.977
Tofu?

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:28.606
I'll make an exception this once.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:30.024
Okay.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:33.364
But that's all.
I don't want you to see me like that.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:34.994
And I've got Bob.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.705
He'll look after me.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:31.562
<i>Bob!</i>

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.023
Hey.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.605
Hey, mister.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:08.124
I'm proud of you, James.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:12.121
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.834
Well, first thing...

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:16.375
...I'm gonna try and find
a way to thank you.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:17.834
Come here.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:24.679
All right, come on, mister.
Let's go. Come on.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:26.802
Yeah.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.730
You take care of yourself.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:32.687
And you.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.601
Thanks, Val.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.438
Come on, mate.

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.777
Corning.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.573
Yeah, that one too.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.158
I'll go in, yeah?

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.575
Wanna give us a hand with this?

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.993
Ready.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.161
Sorry, I don't know
why the door was shut...

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.130
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.258
Look at you.

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:00.795
You did it.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.634
Yeah, just.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:06.050
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:07.559
How do you feel?

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:11.347
Yeah, now I feel good.

01:29:13.223 --> 01:29:14.645
Same...

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.435
...but totally different.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.195
What's going on? You're moving.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:20.446
Yeah.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.073
I'm going home for a while.

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:25.326
- Right.
- I can't stay here.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:27.954
It's not my life.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.703
It was my brother's...

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.868
...and I need to move on.

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:34.953
- Yeah.
- You actually helped me see that.

01:29:36.162 --> 01:29:37.163
Good.

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.456
Yeah.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.003
It doesn't necessarily mean goodbye.

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:45.513
- No.
- Wait.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:53.722
For you.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:55.983
I made this one.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:59.566
- You just have to hang it over...
- Yeah, I know what these are.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.146
Thank you.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.695
That's my address.
It's my parents' address.

01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:07.828
- That's where I'll be staying.
- Elizabeth Robinson.

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:09.738
It's my real name.

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:12.824
Hello, reality.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.373
My number's on there, too...

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:16.707
...in case you need me.

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:19.839
Until we meet again.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:24.303
There was a guy hanging around
who wanted to give you this.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.213
He asked me to make sure you got it.

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.677
Literary agency.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:31.810
Right.

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:35.142
- Say hi to Bob.
- I will do.

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.312
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:38.642
Bye.

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:46.783
Well, we were thinking a book,
for starters.

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:49.982
- We'd like to team you with a ghostwriter.
- He'll help you tell your story.

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:52.030
Sorry, stories.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:55.492
We think it would make a great book.

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:57.661
Or a series of books.

01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:02.215
The important thing is
we need to get hold of you.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:05.048
- I don't actually have a phone currently.
- Okay.

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:07.587
We can sort that.
Should we get one for Bob?

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:09.552
I think we can share.

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:12.847
Looks like he wants to write it, though.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.272
What are you...

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.608
I'm clean, Dad.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.995
- "Clean" as, what, like...?
- Everything.

01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:35.953
I just wanted you to know.

01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:38.914
You know, I was...

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:42.171
I was thinking while I was
standing here just now...

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:47.920
...the last time
I wasn't high in front of you...

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.758
...I was 11.

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:52.465
Before Australia.

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:57.179
I wanted to apologize.

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:01.274
For everything.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.902
I don't blame you for giving up on me.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.660
No, Dad, I don't want your money.

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:26.332
I didn't give up on you.

01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.837
I was ashamed...

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:32.714
...of myself.

01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:36.426
I was never afraid to fly.

01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:40.146
I just didn't know how to do...

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:45.026
I didn't know how to be your father.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:54.785
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

01:32:55.862 --> 01:32:58.206
- No...
- Jack, what are you doing out there?

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:04.083
I'm talking to my son.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.801
And my grandson.

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:14.722
Got him on a lead, don't worry.

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:23.315
Wait till you see the screensaver.

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.642
Look at that.

01:33:27.727 --> 01:33:28.819
Yeah?

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:35.534
Where'd they go, hey?

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:39.122
How are you doing
in the deep blue sea there, Bob?

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:43.877
Hey, come on. I've gotta get this bloke
Gary a load of notes.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.003
Stop fishing.

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:57.678
Morning, monster.

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:00.134
Hello, mate.

01:34:02.428 --> 01:34:03.850
Caught any fish yet?

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.697
<i>How is a guy, who's spent a third
of his life checked out, to write a book?</i>

01:34:13.439 --> 01:34:15.533
Come on, Bob, help me out here.

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:17.619
I'm stuck.

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:29.005
Bob. Bob!

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.012
I just loved it.

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:41.643
- Every word.
- Thank you.

01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:43.303
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Okay.

01:34:43.469 --> 01:34:45.847
James, we're about to start.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:49.268
Not before you say hi
to your biggest fan.

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:52.441
- Betty.
- I'm so proud of you.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.607
Hi. Thanks for coming.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:34:59.990
James.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.702
- James.
- Yeah.

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:05.833
- Bob.
- Okay.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.744
Off you go.

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.296
Okay, Bob.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.465
Great, thank you.

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.467
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.587
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:35:17.754 --> 01:35:19.256
Hey, Bob.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:23.472
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:26.013
- It's all a bit overwhelming.
- Yeah.

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.978
He's got your scarf.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.142
I told you he wasn't a stray.

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:32.773
Bob, you good?

01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:33.937
Yeah.

01:35:37.857 --> 01:35:40.110
Go on, Bob. High-five.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.408
Good boy.

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:49.085
Hi, everyone.

01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:52.084
Didn't expect there to be
so many people here.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:56.509
I could make some joke about there
not being enough room to swing a cat...

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:59.296
...but I don't think Bob would like that.

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.599
A friend helped me with this.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:07.388
And when I was stuck,
her advice was...

01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:10.853
...start by mentioning that
everyone gets a second chance.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:15.107
But that not everyone
manages to take them.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.610
Luckily for me...

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:22.323
...I had some
very important companions...

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:24.704
...to help with my second chance.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:27.831
And then she said...

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:30.210
...to just tell the truth.

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:32.336
And that's what I've done.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.641
- Absolutely loved it, mate. Well done.
- Thank you.

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:50.434
Little paw print there.

01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:52.098
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go.

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:56.861
- You enjoy that?
- Felt like I lived every moment.

01:36:57.395 --> 01:36:58.442
Good.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.320
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:29.927
Come on, you guys.

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:35.353
Keep it going. That's great.

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:36.893
Now you guys.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:50.452
<i>Beautiful! That's great.
Now, the basses.</i>

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:57.289
<i>Come on, get low.</i>

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:03.798
All together!

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:12.390
That's it, beautiful!

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:16.186
We'll break it down now.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:38.080
<i>Yeah! Give yourself a round of applause!</i>

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.419
Yes, brother. Yes, mate.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.675
Nice one, dude.
Bob the cat, eh?
