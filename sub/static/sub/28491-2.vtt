you should understand

10:11.714 --> 10:13.464
that it's
an expensive business,

10:13.547 --> 10:16.839
time-consuming,
and there are alternatives.

10:18.381 --> 10:19.839
- Now, ma'am,

10:19.923 --> 10:21.089
since I was approached

10:21.172 --> 10:22.881
by Mr. Washington
on your behalf,

10:22.964 --> 10:25.297
I have been doing
a bit of asking around,

10:25.381 --> 10:26.506
discreetly.

10:26.589 --> 10:27.839
I assumed you wouldn't mind.

10:27.923 --> 10:31.631
And Mr. Hinscliffe--
the coal merchant--

10:31.714 --> 10:32.798
would be very keen
to offer you

10:32.881 --> 10:34.589
100 pound an acre
for your coal.

10:34.673 --> 10:36.464
But, this is the thing:

10:36.547 --> 10:40.130
at present, he only wants
the one acre down at Mytholm.

10:40.214 --> 10:42.214
Now, really,

10:42.297 --> 10:43.547
if the coal were mine,

10:43.631 --> 10:46.673
I'd be wanting
nearer 200 an acre,

10:46.756 --> 10:47.964
and the Rawsons

10:48.047 --> 10:50.047
are in a position
to pay that.

10:50.130 --> 10:52.005
I understand you don't
want to do business

10:52.089 --> 10:53.589
with the Rawsons,
ma'am, and--

10:53.673 --> 10:55.172
- Mr. Washington thinks
they're stealing my coal.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.631
- I think they
very probably are,

10:56.714 --> 10:59.297
given that your beds abut
directly onto theirs.

10:59.381 --> 11:00.339
But how do you prove it?

11:00.422 --> 11:01.923
- I apply to the
Lord Chancellor for an order

11:02.005 --> 11:03.631
to go down into
the Rawsons' works.

11:03.714 --> 11:05.214
- And by the time you got it,

11:05.297 --> 11:07.255
they'd have turned
the water against you

11:07.339 --> 11:09.255
and flooded your coal,
and nobody'd be able

11:09.339 --> 11:11.464
to get down there to prove
anything one way or the other.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.839
- Water is the enemy, ma'am,
in a mine.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.589
Controlling the flow
is half the job.

11:15.673 --> 11:19.089
- And the rivalry is bitter
and lawless,

11:19.172 --> 11:21.089
and people will use the water
against each other.

11:21.172 --> 11:23.673
- The object would be
to surprise them on the day--

11:23.756 --> 11:25.631

He's a magistrate.

11:46.297 --> 11:47.839

11:47.923 --> 11:51.506
which, if they think
you are going to sell to him,

11:51.589 --> 11:53.047
they'd have to.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.422
Wouldn't they?

11:54.506 --> 11:56.798
Otherwise they'd be worried
that he'd get down there

11:56.881 --> 12:00.214

already taken.

12:00.297 --> 12:03.047

wants that one acre

12:03.130 --> 12:04.381

the Rawsons turning this water

12:05.798 --> 12:07.714
on Hinscliffe if that's what
they're capable of,

12:07.798 --> 12:09.547

and not to them?

it would get that far.
