[BoJack]  Previously on  Philbert...

00:11.344 --> 00:13.722
[sighs] Now I see
why they call you "Sassy."

00:14.264 --> 00:17.559
-Hello, old friend.
-Fritz! But you're dead!

00:17.642 --> 00:20.228
Dead serious... about haunting you.

00:20.311 --> 00:23.481
[sighs] I haven't had sex that good
since my wife died.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.483
To be clear, the sex was pre-death.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.819
Philbert, I don't want to be
one of those girls,

00:27.902 --> 00:29.237
but did you murder your wife?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.281
How many people are dead because of you?

00:31.364 --> 00:34.242
Those were bad guys!
They stole the mayor's submarine.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.285
Tell me what happened.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.913
I'm going to the chief!
The whole world's gonna know what you did.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.042
-You can't do that, Marjorie.
-John, it's over. [gasps]

00:42.125 --> 00:43.793
Fritz, you maniac! What are you doing?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.921
-What you're too chickenshit to do.
-[gasping] John! Help!

00:53.595 --> 00:54.763
You shot your partner?

00:54.846 --> 00:56.389
He was strangling my wife!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.933
Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.895
There's no time for that now.

[Philbert narrating]  It's been six months
since the missiles hit.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.297
The air is thick
with the stench of death,

02:11.589 --> 02:14.592
and the hospitals are delivering
some very wacky babies.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.054
But, finally, they reopened
the Yogurtland near me.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.100
Sometimes, even mushroom clouds
have a silver lining.

02:22.183 --> 02:25.645
Hey, partner. Looks like you're getting
soft... serve frozen yogurt.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.149
[chuckles] Now I continue to see
why they call you "Sassy."

02:29.232 --> 02:31.943
[narrating]  It's also been six months
since I told Sassy the truth.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.945
About Fritz. My wife.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.240
And Sassy hasn't turned me in.
I think she likes me.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.741
-[Sassy sighs]
-[Flip] Cut!

02:38.825 --> 02:41.119
-[bell rings]
-[spits] Ugh!

02:41.202 --> 02:43.413
BoJack, I told you
not to eat the prop food.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.082
That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup!

02:46.666 --> 02:47.625
Why?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.715
[BoJack]  It's been two months since
the first season of  Philbert  came out.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.177
And it's a hit. Which is great for me,
but even better for Gina.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.972
[camera shutters clicking]

03:04.184 --> 03:06.019
You know, I've done so many TV shows,

03:06.102 --> 03:08.897
but this is the first one
that's kind of turned me into a star.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.523
It's a big step up from just recurring

03:10.607 --> 03:12.400
on  The Cops are Coming,
Whee-oo, Whee-oo.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.778
[BoJack]  And the weird part is
I'm not secretly bitter and jealous.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.072
I like seeing her happy.

03:18.156 --> 03:22.452
But I still have this little rancid itch
saying something isn't right.

03:22.535 --> 03:26.414
It's like there's always something
lurking just beyond the horizon.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.208
[ringing]

03:28.291 --> 03:30.293
Philbert the Troubled Detective.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.253
I see. Thank you.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.422
Why do you still use a landline?

03:34.505 --> 03:37.508
[Philbert]  What am I supposed to tell her,
I'm just an old-fashioned guy?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.677
Or maybe I like things
that are plugged to the wall?

03:39.761 --> 03:42.222
Something to grab onto
if I start floating away.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.848
That was my wife's landline.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.059
-[Fritz grunting]
-[gasps]

03:46.142 --> 03:47.936
-I'm so sorry.
-Never mind that.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.270
The chief's been murdered.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.649
Oh, Philbert, that's awful.
I know you didn't want him to be murdered.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.235
Sassy, put on some pants.
You've got a sweet bottom,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.195
but the only bottom
I'm interested in right now

03:57.278 --> 03:59.572
is the bottom of this case,
and getting to it.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.408
Because this time, it's personnel.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.995
-Cut!
-[bell rings]

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
Did you want me to say,
"This time it's  personal"?

04:08.164 --> 04:10.917
No, that's a cliché.
You're saying it's an inside job.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.420
Someone on the force.
"This time, it's  personnel."

04:14.504 --> 04:16.965
-Ah, okay.
-The strangling looks fake.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.551
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier...
[wailing] if I talked like this--

04:20.635 --> 04:22.804
I already told you. No spooky voice!

04:22.887 --> 04:24.847
I can roll my eyes back
and stick my tongue out.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.391
[gagging]

04:27.517 --> 04:29.602
-Eh...?
-Yeah, let's try that.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.938
Gina, you noticed anything funky
about these new scripts?

04:32.021 --> 04:35.233
Yeah. Without Diane around to police
Flip's use of the word "literally,"

04:35.316 --> 04:38.361
you'd think "the literally store"
was going out of business. Figuratively.

04:38.444 --> 04:42.615
What? No. I mean the story with the chief.
I think it's stolen from my life.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.452
I mean, I also had a male boss who died.
Herb Kazazz.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.704
Seems like a coincidence.

04:47.787 --> 04:51.291
The chief is named Basil.
Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.585
I don't think anyone would use a story
from your life without telling you.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.005
-Diane would.
-She's not writing on the show anymore.

04:57.088 --> 05:00.967
You think Flip read her book?
Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb...  ook."

05:01.050 --> 05:03.469
-What's going on with you?
-I'm gonna get to the bottom of this

05:03.553 --> 05:05.680
because this time, it's business.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.307
Personal  business.

-[knocking on door]

05:10.101 --> 05:12.937
Hey, friend.
Where'd you get your ideas from?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.356
I'm just-- I'm so interested
in your process.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.524
Do you make them up,

05:16.607 --> 05:20.236
or get inspired
by other things or people's... lives?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.446
What are you accusing me of?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.364
You think I can't come up
with my own ideas?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.700
Those popsicle guys signed a release.

05:25.783 --> 05:26.617
Popsicle guys?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.953
-What are you talking about?
-What are  you  talking about?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.288
[both] Hmm...

05:31.289 --> 05:34.167
[BoJack]  Something's going on.
I must be singing a song called "Crazy"

05:34.250 --> 05:36.210
because everyone's treating me
like a patsy.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.629
All I know for sure
is Flip's hiding something.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.715
Something about "popsicle guys."

05:40.798 --> 05:43.634
-Hey, buddy. Is everything okay in here?
-Yeah, fine.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.138
Really? Because this trailer belongs
to Stingray Liotta.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.140
[gurgling]

05:49.223 --> 05:51.726
Oh. Uh, I guess I've been
a little distracted.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.854
Are you sure you're okay?
Because you're my friend,

05:54.937 --> 05:57.565
and I would never forgive myself
if something happened to you

05:57.648 --> 05:59.692
that affected our ability
to stay on schedule.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.778
-What?
-BoJack, I care about you,

06:01.861 --> 06:05.239
and also the 218 other people
who will be out of a job

06:05.323 --> 06:09.285
if you spin out like you usually do.
Now are you keeping things together?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.704
I'm not gonna screw up
this professional opportunity for you.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.331
Your concern is very touching.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.042
-What's in those pills you keep taking?
-If you really cared,

06:16.125 --> 06:18.378
you should've been there
the day I fell off a building?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.755
But no. You had other important business
to attend to.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.507
-BoJack--
-You're doing a great job,

06:22.590 --> 06:26.469
making me feel like you give a shit.
You're gonna be an awesome mom.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.763
[sighs] I think you're overworked.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.431
Oh, for real?
With a side order of,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.850
"Ya think?"
And sundry retorts of that fashion.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.976
Here's what's gonna happen.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.770
You're gonna take
the rest of the night off.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.021
You're gonna get some sleep.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.232
And when you come back,
you're gonna be professional,

06:39.315 --> 06:42.026
you're gonna be courteous,
and you're gonna have your shit together.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.988
Fine! And... I'm sorry,
about the mom thing.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.448
Get some sleep.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.993
[sighs]

06:51.077 --> 06:53.454
-I can't sleep.
-Ugh. Yeah, you mentioned.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.708
-Flip was acting very suspicious.
-He sure was. Eight hours ago.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.211
But we're home now,
and it's 4:00 in the morning.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.255
Princess Carolyn's getting
all up in my business!

07:02.338 --> 07:05.675
She told me that I seem "not okay,"
and was "spinning out,"

07:05.758 --> 07:09.470
-and "would make a great mom."
-Not sure you'd be the best mom.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.264
-I'd be a wonderful mother!
-Wow.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.142
[thinking]  Watch it, BoJack.
You're losing it. Gotta be cool for Gina.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.935
What's something a cool person would say?

07:16.018 --> 07:17.186
Uh, hey, Daddy-O.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.731
Gotta splitsville to the lavatory
if you catch my drift. Hang ten!

07:20.815 --> 07:22.859
-Oh, okay.
-Nailed it.

You're taking the character home with you.
It happens to every actor.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.509
I played a girls' PE coach
who solved mysteries

07:48.593 --> 07:50.261
in a pilot called,
Death, She Whistles.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.472
It never went to series,
but I got so into it,

07:52.555 --> 07:54.765
I spent months ordering
every mouthy teen I saw

07:54.849 --> 07:57.685
-to drop and give me 20.
-Yeah, you're probably right.

Hello. I hope you're enjoying  Philbert.
Is everyone having a good time?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.815
-Uh...
-[music stops]

08:44.899 --> 08:48.402
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm in a real situation here

08:48.486 --> 08:52.073
because I did not realize I was supposed
to sell ads for this show.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.533
Nobody specifically told me

08:53.616 --> 08:56.953
that was under the purview
of the president of ad sales!

08:57.036 --> 09:01.290
So, if anyone wants to buy
30 million dollars'-worth of ad time,

09:01.374 --> 09:04.168
or work out
some sort of licensing arrangement,

09:04.252 --> 09:06.462
basically, what you need to know about me

09:06.546 --> 09:10.132
is I am desperate
and will say yes to anything.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.635
Let the negotiations begin!

09:12.718 --> 09:14.929
-[music resumes]
-And now, back to the show.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.102
[BoJack thinking]
Who sent this? What do they know?

09:21.185 --> 09:23.563
Do they know things? Let's find out.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.815
Hey, BoJack!
Did the  L.A. Gazette  come today?

09:25.898 --> 09:28.985
Apparently, I'm on their
"35 Over 35 but Under 40" list.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.279
Uh, no, nothing came today!
I wasn't looking at anything.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.447
Why are you so insistent
that something came today?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.241
Obsessed with things coming much?

09:35.324 --> 09:38.202
Whatever this creep has on me
could ruin the show, And there goes

09:38.286 --> 09:39.453
Gina's newfound happiness.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.914
I gotta find out who sent this.
For her sake.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.837
This case is like the movie,
Love Actually.  No leads.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.964
-Hope the coroner can help us out.
-She will.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.757
We got a lot of history,
me and the coroner.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.011
Here's a picture.
She used to be one of my closest friends.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.012
Used to?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.055
Times change.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.182
[splatters]

10:00.266 --> 10:03.603
[BoJack] Diane! Diane! Diane!
I know you sent me the note!

10:05.062 --> 10:06.897
-What note?
-What  note?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.357
The one you slipped under my door.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.736
See, great actors embody their roles,
so I've picked up some detective skills.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.364
That letter "I" is in a nerd font.
I'd say it's from  The Believer.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.159
And you're the only person
who reads  The Believer.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.537
First of all,  The Believer
is a very popular $12 magazine.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.748
And I didn't send this dumb note.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.460
You love revealing my secrets.
And not sharing your cobbler!

10:27.543 --> 10:30.046
-[sighs]
-Who else could have done it?

10:30.129 --> 10:31.714
I don't know.
Who'd you piss off?

10:32.089 --> 10:34.717
[thinking]  She's right.
Lotta people have it out for me.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.720
[Philbert narrating]  But who the hell
would want to hurt the chief?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.096
Hey, Philbert. This your friend?

10:39.805 --> 10:41.891
-[gasps]
-A second strangling victim.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.143
If it's the same killer,
he's a real pain in the neck.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.853
Hey, there's being sassy,

10:45.936 --> 10:49.106
and there's going over the line
with humor. Literally.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.360
All right, enough chokes.
Let's put together a list of suspects.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.612
Yeah, suspects.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.531
[Philbert]  Gotta keep it together
and go through the suspects.

11:00.076 --> 11:00.951
[rattling]

11:02.036 --> 11:04.038
[thinking]  Who would wanna take down
BoJack Horseman?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.166
[clicks]

11:07.249 --> 11:08.125
Huh.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.961
No. Don't call Charlotte.
That's a terrible idea. Don't do it.

11:11.045 --> 11:11.962
[ringing]

11:12.129 --> 11:15.049
Hello! Charlotte's husband Kyle here!

11:15.424 --> 11:17.426
[Kyle]  Hello? Hello, hello, hello?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
This is your last chance, okay?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.305
- Three, two...
-Uh...

11:21.389 --> 11:23.599
All right, you get another second here.
What's going on?

11:23.683 --> 11:27.436
-I'm doing a survey for the cable company.
-All right.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.271
I've got time for a survey.
Kinda fun to think

11:29.355 --> 11:32.441
big-time corporations care
about what little old Kyle thinks.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.736
[speaking with mock Scottish accent]
On a scale of one to ten,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.738
how would you rate your cable service?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.990
Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.
Let's see.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.076
Don't take this personally,
but I'm gonna say eight.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.579
And on a scale of one to ten,
how is your marriage?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.665
Well, that's a little personal,
don't ya think?

11:47.748 --> 11:49.083
Oh, okay. Uh...

11:49.208 --> 11:52.545
But I guess if it helps your survey--
my wife and I had some rough patches,

11:52.628 --> 11:54.422
but we're stronger
now we've got through them.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.675
-I'm gonna give us an eight.
-Okay, so it sounds like your wife

11:57.758 --> 12:01.053
isn't obsessed with a desire
to exact revenge on a former friend?

12:01.137 --> 12:04.265
-What?
-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.727
-I don't think so.
-Okay, wonderful.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.894
On a scale of one to ten,

12:08.978 --> 12:11.522
how would you rate
your daughter's sexual maturity?

12:11.605 --> 12:14.483
-Boy, that's a sticky one.
-I'm just reading what's in front of me.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.318
Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.655
Uh, let's say
that one is, "Horribly scarred

12:19.739 --> 12:21.198
by an older man she trusted

12:21.282 --> 12:24.744
and is now dedicated to getting
the word out about the bad thing he did,"

12:24.827 --> 12:27.288
[normal voice]
and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

12:27.371 --> 12:29.165
in a healthy way on her own timetable

12:29.248 --> 12:31.876
and is now completely emotionally
well-adjusted?"

12:31.959 --> 12:33.127
I don't know, maybe eight?

12:33.210 --> 12:35.045
I feel like I'm kind of defaulting
to eights.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.590
-Okay, thanks, bye!
-Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.467
Question number one.
What channel is Netflix?

12:39.550 --> 12:41.552
Gotta get back to Scotland.
You're the man now, dawg.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.220
Well, that didn't pan out.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.681
We got no leads,
and the Olive Garden won't deliver.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.892
Sure, when you're there, you're "family."

12:47.975 --> 12:51.437
There's gotta be something we're not
seeing. All these victims, strangled.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.523
Yeah, this case just gets
strangler and strangler.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.192
You made puns!

12:56.275 --> 12:57.860
You could laugh after two murders.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.113
But now we're talking about eight
innocent people killed in five days!

13:01.197 --> 13:03.115
This guy's really going full throttle.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.410
[chuckles] I guess it's just funnier
when I do it.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.913
-The point is, we have to stop him.
-[sighs]

13:10.080 --> 13:13.584
So many people could have sent that note.
Why do so many people hate me?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.377
Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.088
Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt
in a dream he had.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.799
I'm not sure production assistants

13:19.882 --> 13:22.176
are supposed to help make lists
of enemies.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.387
Hey, if you're gonna whine like that,
put your own picture on the wall too.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.515
Oh, shit, what time is it?
I gotta get to set.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.558
We  are  on set.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.144
Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.397
[buzzing, popping]

13:39.527 --> 13:42.404
[Flip] I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us!

13:42.488 --> 13:44.365
[Princess Carolyn]
Oh, he's not onto anything.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.367
[Flip] I think he knows
about the popsicle guys!

13:46.450 --> 13:47.952
-Wha--?
-Pickles, about dinner tonight,

13:48.035 --> 13:51.288
am I any network with a show
starring Kyle Bornheimer?

13:51.372 --> 13:53.249
-Because I have to cancel.
-Shh, shh, shh!

13:53.332 --> 13:55.376
Nothing's wrong.
Just another heavy night of shooting.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.503
-Sha-sha-shh!
-Gotta go! Love you!

13:57.586 --> 13:59.129
-Shh! Shh!
-Love being monogamous!

13:59.213 --> 14:01.215
-[phone beeps]
-[sighs] Hey, BoJack!

14:01.298 --> 14:04.593
Look at you, skulking behind doors
with a malevolent aura.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.595
-Someone is hiding something.
-How did you know?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.932
-Did you talk to Diane?
-Yes. I did talk to Diane.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.268
BoJack, I promise it was a one-time thing.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.104
The worst thing that could happen is
if I lost your respect over this.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.982
I couldn't live with myself
if your respect for me fell any lower

14:18.065 --> 14:19.984
than the current level of respect
you have for me,

14:20.067 --> 14:22.236
which as we both know is very high.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.280
Can we pretend
this whole thing never happened?

14:24.363 --> 14:26.323
-What whole thing?
-Thank you.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.369
There's gotta be a simple explanation.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.955
No. I'm telling you,
this whole thing is rotten, Gina.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.874
-[Flip] You said "Gina" again!
-What?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.793
You called her "Gina."
The character's name is "Sassy."

14:37.877 --> 14:41.130
Right. Um, no.
This whole thing is rotten, Sassy.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.340
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together, okay?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.509
-Okay.
-In the morning.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.219
-[clicks]
-[Sassy sighs]

14:47.428 --> 14:48.345
[sighs]

14:48.429 --> 14:50.472
-[pistol clicks]
-[gasps] Fritz!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.391
We're not so different, you and I.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.728
In fact, in many ways,
you might even say we're the same.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.440
Samie, samie, samie-same,
you might say.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.816
Twinsies, even.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.111
-Fritz, you're not real.
-Does this feel real enough for ya?

15:04.194 --> 15:07.031
[grunts] You don't have to do this.
You can trust me.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.115
I do trust you.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.533
[sighs]

15:09.617 --> 15:11.577
But I don't trust  her.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.162
-[grunts]
-Ugh!

15:13.245 --> 15:15.414
And that's why I still have a landline.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.792
-[yelling]
-[gasps, panting]

15:19.710 --> 15:22.004
What's going on? I'm a heavy sleeper.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.424
The pieces are starting to fit together.
Literally.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.636
[BoJack thinking]  He's got a secret
he won't tell me. And he's not alone.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.346
That's why she keeps checking on me--

15:30.429 --> 15:32.598
to make sure that I'm not getting
too close to the truth.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.849
Who else is in on it?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.310
Mr. Peanutbutter. He's up to something.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.938
Something involving... Diane!

15:39.021 --> 15:41.190
But what do they all have in...

15:41.774 --> 15:42.816
Common?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.407
They all made  Philbert.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.619
This whole show is designed
to reveal my secrets and destroy me.

15:53.702 --> 15:58.290
And poor Gina is caught up in the madness.
I have to find a way protect her! Get it?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
Everyone's evil.
It's a conspiracy to destroy you.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.878
Protect Gina. Got it.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.215
The Fascinating Mysteries
of Detective BoJack Who Is Great...

16:06.507 --> 16:08.133
will continue after this.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.846
What...?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.266
I really think we should get to set.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.644
-Aren't we on set?
-You're at home.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.022
I came to get you
because you didn't show up at call time.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.900
Why didn't you come earlier? [gasps]
Are you trying to take me down, too?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.069
Down... to set.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.323
-[Flip groaning]
-[BoJack gasping]

16:31.949 --> 16:34.535
Hey, everyone!
BoJack's here, ready to shoot!

16:34.618 --> 16:37.121
-What are we waiting for? Come on.
-All right, set it up!

16:37.329 --> 16:38.789
BoJack, what's going on with you?

16:38.872 --> 16:41.667
I can't tell her the truth.
She's safer knowing nothing.

16:41.750 --> 16:45.546
-You realize you just said that out loud?
-Oh. Sorry. Too many night shoots.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.006
It's so hard to lie to her.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.633
You just said that out loud, too.
You do know this is real, right?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.760
More real than you even know, dollface.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.138
Face. Clocks have faces.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.389
That's it! [gasping]

16:55.681 --> 16:57.307
Where the hell is he going?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.478
[muttering] Gotta get 'em...
Gotta go. Gotta catch up.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.237
-[yelps]
-Todd Chavez. The man in charge.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.655
The guy who has a face,

17:11.739 --> 17:14.825
which is what clocks have,
and also hands, which clocks have, too.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.953
I should have known his clocky-handy face
was behind this.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.414
-Hi, BoJack!
-The gif is up, bozzo.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.833
-Spill the beefs.
-Okay, you got me.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.294
In order to offset the costs
of video hosting,

17:25.377 --> 17:28.797
I needed to sign a licensing deal
with a pharmaceutical company,

17:28.881 --> 17:34.094
but I think this still maintains
the dignity of Flip's original vision.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.512
"Oopsie, gotta poopsie"?

17:35.596 --> 17:38.265
That sounds like a thing
Philbert would say, right?

17:38.348 --> 17:40.601
We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox,

17:40.684 --> 17:43.604
and a campaign with a national taco chain.

17:43.687 --> 17:48.192
The "Philburrito." So zesty,
you'll forget your murdered wife.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.736
[gasps] So, you wrote the note!

17:50.819 --> 17:52.863
-Uh, no, that's--
-Tell me the truth, Chavez!

17:52.946 --> 17:54.907
Have you always been
secretly jealous of me?

17:54.990 --> 17:58.285
Did you hate that you were a nothing
and I was a successful cop?

17:58.368 --> 18:01.330
Did you create this entire
television show to destroy me?

18:01.413 --> 18:05.417
That's a lotta questions,
but, generally, no.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.253
-This ends now.
-Hey, whoa, whoa, careful!

18:08.545 --> 18:09.546
Ooh!

18:10.714 --> 18:11.590
[beeping]

18:11.673 --> 18:13.634
-Fritz! Put down the gun.
-No, BoJack, that's not--

18:13.717 --> 18:16.428
[Henry Fondle]  I am going to blow my load!

18:16.512 --> 18:17.846
Don't. Don't pull the trigger!

18:17.930 --> 18:21.141
It is imminent!
Prepare to exchange fluids.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.019
-No!
- Beep, beep!  [groans]

18:24.394 --> 18:27.898
You're a super gal. I'll call you.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.358
Fritz is getting away! [grunts]

18:29.441 --> 18:31.693
-BoJack, hold on--
-[grunts]

18:31.777 --> 18:33.278
[panting]

18:34.363 --> 18:35.697
[yelps]

18:37.699 --> 18:39.118
-[gasps, yelps]
-[popping]

18:39.743 --> 18:41.245
[gasps]

18:42.788 --> 18:45.290
-BoJack, what are we doing?
-What?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.084
All this running around.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.295
Gina. Someone is trying to take me down,
take the show down.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.047
So, what, you solve this little mystery,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.424
fix this little hole,
and then everything will be fine?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.592
I'm doing this for you.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.428
You don't want that.
For everything to be fine?

18:58.512 --> 19:02.141

-I noticed.
-I've noticed you noticing.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.509
I've made some progress in our case,
but, uh... you're not gonna like it.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.386
-Try me.
-It's about Fritz.

-[gasps]

21:03.804 --> 21:06.765
So, I guess some of this detective stuff
is starting to rub off on me,

21:06.848 --> 21:08.892
because I figured out
what's been going on with you.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.227
-Gina?
-I found your stashes

21:10.310 --> 21:12.479
in the toilet paper rolls.
Then I looked around the house

21:12.562 --> 21:15.649
and found all your other
clever little hiding places.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.319
-How many of these do you take a day?
-Hey. Those are mine. Okay? I need those.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.237

21:20.654 --> 21:23.198
I swear to God,
you try that again and you're dead.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.492
Sassy, I'm not the bad guy here.
It's Fritz.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.494
I didn't want to tell you this,
but he's back.

21:27.577 --> 21:31.290
I don't know how. Maybe the nuclear blast
resurrected him somehow.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.417
You're my partner. We need to find him.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.002
I'm with Internal Affairs, you moron.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.587
When you told me Fritz killed your wife,
something didn't add up.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.300
I tried to find Fritz in the system, but
there's no record of him ever existing.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.467
-What?
-In fact,

21:42.551 --> 21:44.594
there's no record of you
ever having a partner at all.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.179
What are you saying?

21:46.596 --> 21:48.056
[grunting]

21:48.348 --> 21:51.852
You killed your wife. And the chief.
And the coroner. And the others.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.061
Why would I do that?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.480
Because they knew you,
and they knew your secrets.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.815
But I know your secrets now.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.776

22:07.409 --> 22:08.577
-I need those pills!
-Bullshit.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.496
You have no idea what I'm going through.
I'm trying to protect you, Gina!

22:11.580 --> 22:12.706
Protect me from what?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.376
-Are you serious?
-Someone is trying to blackmail me.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.920
-BoJack, this is from the show.
-What?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.130
It's marketing.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.299
-[Gina] Everyone in L.A. got one.
-Huh.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.760
It's a copy of the note
that Philbert gets.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.430
-You sent this note. It was  you.
-No, Philbert.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.058
[Sassy]  It was you.
The guilt was unbearable.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.560
It ate you up inside,
and drove you to madness.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.397

-Oh? Or should I say... no "O."

22:44.696 --> 22:46.281
You don't remember shooting that scene?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.408
Well, I-- I guess
I've been a little distracted.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.077
"Distracted"? You've been high.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.205
No. It's not high, Gina, that's not--
It makes things normal.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.458
Normal? You're a goddamn mess,
and you're gonna ruin my show.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.335
-Oh,  your  show?
-That's not what I meant.

22:58.418 --> 23:01.004
No, that's very helpful.
I understand what you're worried about.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.840
-I thought it was me, but it's your show.
-BoJack, listen.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.426
It would really be a shame
if your show was ruined

23:06.510 --> 23:08.720
by your boyfriend's
debilitating drug problem.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.514
-Stop it.
-Where would you go to sing

23:10.597 --> 23:12.474
-with your popsicle dancers?
-Popsicle dancers?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.059
-Give me my pills back!
-No.

23:14.142 --> 23:14.976
So, what happens now?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.478
-Turn yourself in.
-Are you kidding?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.939
I know there's a good man
buried somewhere in there, Philbert.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.399
He's the man I fell in love with.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.610

-I'm going.
-Gina, no. Come on.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.714
Stay away from me. Get help. Or don't.
