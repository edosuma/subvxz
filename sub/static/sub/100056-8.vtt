00:02.172 --> 00:04.099
Patient is a 65-year-old male,

00:04.100 --> 00:07.191
admitted with lymphedema
and hidradenitis suppurativa.

00:07.192 --> 00:08.284
Patient is also...

00:08.285 --> 00:09.378
This food is crap.

00:09.379 --> 00:11.097
... combative.

00:11.098 --> 00:14.368
Dr. Kenney and Dr. Gilani,
the pleasure will be yours.

00:14.369 --> 00:15.435
Hello, Mr. Tuverson.

00:15.436 --> 00:17.537
I'm Dr. Kenney, this is Dr. Gilani.

00:17.538 --> 00:19.540
Have they stopped letting
men be doctors now?

00:19.541 --> 00:23.376
Mr. Tuverson, hidradenitis
suppurativa refers

00:23.377 --> 00:25.946
to this cluster of
boils in your groin area.

00:25.947 --> 00:28.226
Now, your lymphedema

00:28.227 --> 00:30.017
is what's creating the
swelling in your leg.

00:30.018 --> 00:31.520
I don't like your voice.

00:32.418 --> 00:34.354
Oh, gosh.

00:34.355 --> 00:36.656
Well, I guess we'll just have
to get your ears checked, too.

00:36.657 --> 00:38.458
As I was saying...

00:38.459 --> 00:39.992
Your tone is a little naggy.

00:39.993 --> 00:41.595
Does your husband tell you that?

00:41.596 --> 00:44.665
- I-I'm divorced.
- That's a shocker.

00:44.666 --> 00:47.835
Okay, I'm sorry, but have
you heard your own voice?

00:47.836 --> 00:49.470
Because you're no Josh Groban.

00:49.471 --> 00:51.504
As a matter of fact,
you're a real piece of...

00:51.505 --> 00:54.942
Dr. Kenney, let's take
this outside, shall we?

00:54.943 --> 00:56.577
Mr. Tuverson, you can page

00:56.578 --> 00:58.178
the nurses' station
if you need anything.

01:00.382 --> 01:02.482
I have news for all of you.

01:02.483 --> 01:04.483
Mr. Tuverson will not be
the last difficult patient

01:04.485 --> 01:06.386
you encounter in your careers.

01:06.387 --> 01:07.854
He won't even be the most difficult.

01:07.855 --> 01:09.757
Just last week, I had a patient ask me

01:09.758 --> 01:12.458
if I was here as part of
a "reparations" program.

01:12.459 --> 01:14.695
What did you do?

01:14.696 --> 01:15.796
I saved her life.

01:17.131 --> 01:18.598
As doctors, you'll meet patients

01:18.599 --> 01:20.885
who are rude, offensive and mean.

01:20.886 --> 01:23.537
Your job isn't to judge
them, it's to treat them.

01:23.538 --> 01:25.606
Understood?

01:25.607 --> 01:26.907
Good. Moving on.

01:26.908 --> 01:28.574
Dr. Kutcher and Dr. Sommers,

01:28.575 --> 01:30.410
you'll take the patient in Room 410.

01:30.411 --> 01:32.579
Got it. I'll take the
lead on this one, newbie.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.450
We've been here the same amount of time.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.924
You two will also be
covering the slip-and-fall

01:39.925 --> 01:41.621
admitted this morning. Remember,

01:41.622 --> 01:44.824
it is essential that we present
a calm, professional face

01:44.825 --> 01:46.826
- to our patients at all times.
- Understood.

01:46.827 --> 01:48.594
Patient's name is...

01:48.595 --> 01:50.097
- Phyllis!
- Carol!

01:50.098 --> 01:52.900
- Oh, my gosh, Carol.
- I've missed you so much.

01:52.901 --> 01:55.101
- Mwah, mwah.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:55.102 --> 01:57.970
To be fair, for Carol, that is calm.

01:57.971 --> 01:59.839
Oh, Carol.

02:01.864 --> 02:04.432
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

02:07.073 --> 02:09.002
- You look wonderful.
- Never better.

02:09.002 --> 02:10.610
- I cannot believe you are here.
- How are you?

02:10.612 --> 02:12.012
- You're so professional.
- Well...

02:12.013 --> 02:13.482
My God, there's two of them.

02:15.117 --> 02:16.985
Good luck, Dr. Gilani.

02:16.986 --> 02:18.986
Ooh! Where are my manners?

02:18.987 --> 02:21.588
Dr. Gilani, this is Phyllis.

02:21.589 --> 02:23.023
Oh, we're old friends.

02:23.024 --> 02:25.325
- Yeah, I got that.
- Phyllis and I

02:25.326 --> 02:27.160
were science teachers together.

02:27.161 --> 02:29.787
Do you know, we actually
started on the same day.

02:29.788 --> 02:31.032
I did not!

02:31.033 --> 02:32.666
It's true, we did.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.159
I was so nervous.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.969
- And then I saw this petite brunette...
- That's right.

02:35.970 --> 02:37.429
- ... walking through the cafeteria,
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.323
and I thought she was
a student skipping out,

02:39.324 --> 02:40.605
but she wasn't.

02:40.606 --> 02:42.309
- It wasn't. It was me.
- It was her.

02:43.045 --> 02:44.479
One year, we even rewrote

02:44.480 --> 02:45.980
- the whole science curriculum.
- That's right.

02:45.981 --> 02:48.016
No frickin' way. Just the two of you?

02:48.017 --> 02:50.450
Yes.

02:50.451 --> 02:52.520
- Who else was gonna do it, Mr. Damelin?
- Oh!

02:54.556 --> 02:57.659
- I mean, can you imagine?
- I cannot.

02:57.660 --> 03:01.428
- Oh, it is so good to see you, Dr. Carol.
- Mm-hmm.

03:01.429 --> 03:02.754
Oh, it's so impressive.

03:02.755 --> 03:04.131
Oh, it's nothing.

03:04.132 --> 03:06.067
- Do you like my coat?
- Yes.

03:06.068 --> 03:07.692
And this badge lets me go

03:07.693 --> 03:09.262
almost anywhere in the hospital.

03:09.263 --> 03:11.866
Speaking of hospitals, should
we talk about why you're in one?

03:11.867 --> 03:13.199
Oh, it's silly, really.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.379
I-I fell doing sun salutations
in my succulent garden.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.072
- This whole side is just sore.
- Oh.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.841
Yeah, the, uh, hip pain you reported

03:20.842 --> 03:22.009
may indicate a small fracture.

03:22.010 --> 03:23.344
We'll send you for an MRI

03:23.345 --> 03:25.213
along with a standard
senior blood panel.

03:25.214 --> 03:27.180
Get a load of the doctor lingo!

03:27.181 --> 03:29.216
Yeah. Right?

03:29.217 --> 03:31.785
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

03:31.786 --> 03:35.390
You look so rested, and happier
than I have ever seen you.

03:35.391 --> 03:37.035
- Is it the yoga?
- It's retirement.

03:37.036 --> 03:38.337
- Oh.
- I also started

03:38.338 --> 03:40.027
a wine-pairing class, plus...

03:40.028 --> 03:42.261
I'm taking French lessons
three times a week.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.161
Ooh la la.

03:44.162 --> 03:46.905
Oh, Phyllis and I used to
fantasize about going to France.

03:46.906 --> 03:48.157
- Just the two of us.
- Yeah, well,

03:48.158 --> 03:51.102
who else were we
gonna go with? Mr. Damelin?

03:51.103 --> 03:53.105
Yeah, if you want someone to ruin it.

03:53.106 --> 03:55.908
- Yes, that's right. That's right.
- Yeah.

03:55.909 --> 03:58.510
So, hold on to your beret, Dr. Carol,

03:58.511 --> 04:00.144
because I'm going.

04:00.145 --> 04:02.113
- Seriously, you're doing it?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:02.114 --> 04:04.683
The Louvre? Versailles?
A baguette crawl?

04:04.684 --> 04:07.585
Two baguette crawls,
and a fromage-a-thon.

04:08.954 --> 04:11.155
Tell me everything.

04:11.156 --> 04:12.848
Okay, Dr. Carol, we need

04:12.849 --> 04:14.192
- to get those tests ordered.
- Okay.

04:14.193 --> 04:15.385
- Okay. When you come back,
- Yes.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.161
- I'll show you pictures of the hotel I'm staying at.
- Okay.

04:17.163 --> 04:18.995
- This quaint little Marriott,
- Yeah.

04:18.997 --> 04:22.435
right off La Rue de l'Airport Highway.

04:25.138 --> 04:26.505
The CT was negative.

04:26.506 --> 04:28.373
I'm not sure why his neck
pain is so persistent.

04:28.374 --> 04:30.508
I think his new blood pressure
meds could be interacting

04:30.509 --> 04:33.505
with his olanzapine, causing
spasmodic torticollis.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.443
It sounds like a pasta,
but it's actually

04:35.444 --> 04:37.810
a tasty little muscle spasm.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.344
Where'd you learn that, Burning Man?

04:40.345 --> 04:42.647
No, if you do it right,

04:42.648 --> 04:45.283
you don't remember what
you learned at Burning Man.

04:45.284 --> 04:48.677
We should try baclofen
and an anticholinergic.

04:48.678 --> 04:51.193
All right, gentlemen, what's
the differential diagnosis?

04:51.194 --> 04:52.658
- Uh, actually, we...
- The patient is suffering

04:52.659 --> 04:54.966
from spasmodic torticollis
caused by a drug interaction.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.687
I recommend treatment with oral
baclofen and an anticholinergic.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.112
Excellent observation.

04:59.113 --> 05:00.724
Write up the order, Dr.Kutcher.

05:00.725 --> 05:01.725
Very good work.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.305
I know I took credit,
but you can't hesitate

05:07.306 --> 05:08.673
when a life is on the line.

05:08.674 --> 05:10.344
He's having a neck spasm.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.101
Doesn't matter. Medicine
is a competitive field.

05:14.102 --> 05:15.336
You snooze, you lose.

05:15.337 --> 05:17.137
Okay.

05:17.138 --> 05:19.139
Okay?

05:19.140 --> 05:21.243
I'm gonna grab a snack.

05:23.378 --> 05:25.114
I don't like how that ended.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.283
Phyllis just seemed so relaxed.

05:30.284 --> 05:31.685
Like if you picked her up and listened,

05:31.686 --> 05:33.154
you'd hear the ocean.

05:34.289 --> 05:37.057
Yeah, like a loud, crashing ocean.

05:37.058 --> 05:39.060
Yeah.

05:39.061 --> 05:40.995
She does make retirement look good.

05:40.996 --> 05:43.933
Isn't it crazy you did
this instead of that?

05:45.633 --> 05:47.300
No. It wasn't crazy.

05:47.301 --> 05:49.036
I wanted to follow my dreams.

05:49.037 --> 05:53.308
All I know is, as soon as
my period goes away, so do I.

05:57.611 --> 06:00.047
Dr. Kenney.

06:00.048 --> 06:01.707
I know that face.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.264
Is it that obvious?

06:03.265 --> 06:07.387
I guess at our age, it's normal
to question your life decisions.

06:07.388 --> 06:09.624
Oh, is that what you're doing?

06:11.325 --> 06:13.296
I just thought you'd
forgotten where you parked.

06:15.921 --> 06:17.179
Tell me more.

06:17.180 --> 06:19.632
Well, it's just an
old colleague showed up

06:19.633 --> 06:22.202
and gave me a vision
of the road not taken.

06:22.203 --> 06:25.172
And I got to say, it looked really nice.

06:25.173 --> 06:27.540
Aren't you already
taking the road not taken?

06:27.541 --> 06:29.410
Yes. Yes, I am.

06:29.411 --> 06:31.211
And I am pursuing what I love.

06:31.212 --> 06:34.906
It's just, I also love a lot
of other things that we never

06:34.907 --> 06:37.317
have time to do on our
schedule, like travel.

06:37.318 --> 06:39.398
Oh, there are some very
nice conferences in Delaware.

06:41.056 --> 06:42.355
I-I was thinking Europe.

06:42.356 --> 06:45.428
But Delaware is also... a place.

06:47.195 --> 06:50.064
Look, I am sure after I
practice medicine for a while,

06:50.065 --> 06:52.699
I'll retire and-and eventually
get some traveling in.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.236
Well, statistically
speaking, probably not.

06:56.604 --> 06:58.706
Studies have shown that
the first year of residency

06:58.707 --> 07:00.609
takes six years off your life.

07:07.248 --> 07:10.117
You're really washing that yogurt cup.

07:10.118 --> 07:11.452
You're mad.

07:11.453 --> 07:13.353
Yeah. I'm furious.

07:13.354 --> 07:17.824
It's 2019 and we still live in
a world with single-use plastics.

07:17.825 --> 07:19.492
No.

07:19.493 --> 07:21.362
About before with Dr. Jacobs,

07:21.363 --> 07:23.497
when you nailed the diagnosis,
but I took credit for it?

07:23.498 --> 07:24.542
Oh, that?

07:24.543 --> 07:25.913
No worries, all good.

07:29.638 --> 07:32.505
I see what's going on here.

07:32.506 --> 07:35.308
You're pretending you're
not mad, but you're pissed.

07:35.309 --> 07:37.611
You're hatching a little revenge
plan right now, aren't you?

07:37.612 --> 07:38.678
No.

07:38.679 --> 07:41.148
Yeah. You are.

07:41.149 --> 07:43.519
All right, Caleb. Two
can play at this game.

07:45.119 --> 07:48.456
Oh, Lexie, I have had a day.

07:48.457 --> 07:50.824
My gout patient has
uric acid nephropathy,

07:50.825 --> 07:53.011
Mrs. Murray sneezed into my mouth,

07:53.012 --> 07:55.129
and then I dropped my I.D.
badge down that little gap

07:55.130 --> 07:56.781
between the elevator and the floor.

07:56.782 --> 07:58.908
I looked so good in that photo.

07:58.909 --> 08:01.068
Well,

08:01.069 --> 08:03.159
forget your troubles
'cause I got you a bagel.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.605
With extra cream cheese. Oh.

08:04.606 --> 08:06.406
You are a lifesaver.

08:06.407 --> 08:07.707
I...

08:07.708 --> 08:09.310
Five-second rule.

08:09.311 --> 08:11.952
In a hospital?

08:11.953 --> 08:13.976
Lexie, you know what's on
the floor of a hospital?

08:13.977 --> 08:15.499
Yeah, your bagel.

08:16.826 --> 08:19.147
I know. I know.

08:19.148 --> 08:23.842
Oh. Bonjour, Carol.
J'avais fini mon MRI.

08:25.302 --> 08:28.262
Voilà, croissant.

08:28.263 --> 08:31.298
Carol, did you used to
be as fun as your friend?

08:31.299 --> 08:32.599
Yes, and I'm still fun.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.903
- Oh, yeah, but not as fun as your friend.
- Oh.

08:35.904 --> 08:38.630
"Fun"? What's more fun
than living my dream?

08:38.631 --> 08:40.556
A bientot, mon amie.

08:46.347 --> 08:49.318
Great. Skirt One and Skirt Two.

08:50.452 --> 08:53.945
Technically, I'm more of a "skort".

08:53.946 --> 08:55.946
Now, there's a small
chance we might be able

08:55.947 --> 08:57.949
to treat your hidradenitis suppurativa

08:57.950 --> 08:58.975
with laser therapy.

08:58.976 --> 09:00.218
We're just waiting for approval.

09:00.219 --> 09:01.820
What is it with women and approval?

09:01.821 --> 09:02.989
No wonder you're divorced.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.531
For your lymphedema,

09:06.532 --> 09:09.393
I am going to walk you through
a manual drainage technique.

09:09.394 --> 09:11.997
It's essentially a massage
so I'll demonstrate for you.

09:11.998 --> 09:13.498
Oh, now we're talking.

09:15.201 --> 09:17.902
Okay. You'll just need
to use gentle pressure

09:17.903 --> 09:19.236
moving up the leg like this.

09:19.237 --> 09:22.840
Push in, then up. In, then up.

09:22.841 --> 09:25.343
Less talky-talky, more rubby-rubby.

09:25.344 --> 09:28.846
Mr. Tuverson, more shushy-shushy.

09:28.847 --> 09:31.016
It's okay, Dr. Gilani.

09:31.017 --> 09:34.018
Mr. Tuverson is a human
being and our patient.

09:34.019 --> 09:38.056
It's our duty to
treat him, and we enjoy it.

09:38.057 --> 09:40.157
- Do you have any questions?
- Yeah.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.327
Do you two ever kiss?

09:42.861 --> 09:45.029
Mr. Tuverson, that is not appropriate.

09:45.030 --> 09:47.165
So uptight. Maybe you need a massage.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.933
Crossing a line.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.167
I hope it's a panty line.

09:50.168 --> 09:53.071
You know what?

09:53.072 --> 09:55.531
I did not spend the
last six years of my life

09:55.532 --> 09:57.008
working days, nights and weekends

09:57.009 --> 09:59.444
to be talked down to by a pervert.

09:59.445 --> 10:01.046
I could be in France

10:01.047 --> 10:02.947
on mile six of a fromage-a-thon,

10:02.948 --> 10:05.216
but no, I became Dr. Kenney.

10:05.217 --> 10:07.762
And so here I am massaging your thigh

10:07.763 --> 10:09.220
and draining your boils.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.989
And I'm not doing
this because I have to,

10:10.990 --> 10:13.124
I'm doing it because I love it.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.527
This is my dream, and
second-guessing my dream

10:15.528 --> 10:18.897
would be insane and I am not insane.

10:18.898 --> 10:21.932
This is your "I'm not insane" speech?

10:21.933 --> 10:24.101
I hate to agree with Tuvie here,

10:24.102 --> 10:25.604
- but maybe you should take a breather.
- Oh, no.

10:25.605 --> 10:28.254
No, thank you. No break for Dr. Kenney.

10:28.255 --> 10:30.088
Just work, work, work until I die

10:30.089 --> 10:31.406
six years before I'm supposed to.

10:31.407 --> 10:32.598
Probably in this hospital.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.412
Possibly in Delaware!

10:35.413 --> 10:38.316
As I was saying, it is push, then up.

10:38.317 --> 10:40.378
- What is she doing?
- Push, up.

10:40.379 --> 10:41.584
She's living her dream!

10:41.585 --> 10:43.354
Push, up.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.503
Lexie, I-I'm fine. I just
need to get back to work.

10:48.504 --> 10:49.738
No, you need to rest.

10:49.739 --> 10:51.389
You just tried to
massage a man to death.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.334
- Not my finest moment.
- No.

10:55.335 --> 10:58.167
Your finest moment was
when you parallel parked

10:58.168 --> 11:00.004
- that school bus downtown.
- Yes.

11:04.053 --> 11:05.720
I can take care of
our patients for a bit.

11:05.721 --> 11:08.849
I think you should just
retire with Phyllis, okay?

11:08.850 --> 11:10.325
Have fun, you two.

11:11.381 --> 11:13.147
Pull up a chair. Sit with me.

11:13.148 --> 11:14.750
Thanks.

11:14.751 --> 11:17.084
Today was a day.

11:17.085 --> 11:18.439
It's nice to take a minute.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.888
- You know, when I need to get my zen on,
- Yeah.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.657
I work on one of these.

11:22.658 --> 11:24.392
- A coloring book?
- No,

11:24.393 --> 11:25.894
it's an adult coloring book.

11:25.895 --> 11:28.262
You brought smut into the hospital?

11:28.263 --> 11:30.899
No. Carol, it's for adults.

11:30.900 --> 11:34.102
- Oh.
- It's detailed patterns and images.

11:34.103 --> 11:37.297
That one with the pandas
is a little suggestive,

11:37.298 --> 11:40.310
but... I'm sure they're just wrestling.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.309
Go on.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.377
Give it a try.

11:43.378 --> 11:47.314
You get focused on staying
within the lines, huh?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.118
So what do you think?

11:50.152 --> 11:51.686
Carol?

11:51.687 --> 11:55.257
I'm making this panda blue.

11:56.825 --> 11:58.729
I don't think they're wrestling.

12:00.729 --> 12:02.733
They're not wrestling.

12:04.736 --> 12:06.628
Sounds like the common cold,

12:06.629 --> 12:08.655
but his cough has lasted way too long.

12:08.656 --> 12:10.072
Mm, fatigue, weight loss.

12:10.073 --> 12:12.074
I know it's uncommon,
but I'm thinking TB.

12:12.075 --> 12:14.276
Plus, his chart shows
history of a positive PPD.

12:14.277 --> 12:15.776
Nice call, man.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.912
When Dr. Jacobs comes in,
you should lead with that.

12:17.913 --> 12:19.282
Great, I'll start...

12:21.283 --> 12:23.084
Wait a second.

12:23.085 --> 12:25.912
You don't think it's
TB at all, do you? No.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.222
I see what's going on here.

12:27.223 --> 12:28.457
You know it's not TB,

12:28.458 --> 12:30.791
but you want me to tell Dr.
Jacobs, so I look like an idiot.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.794
Then you can swoop in with
whatever brilliant diagnosis

12:32.795 --> 12:35.296
you're hiding in that
sick little brain of yours.

12:35.297 --> 12:38.232
- I really think it's TB.
- I know your game.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.401
Dr. Jacobs.

12:39.402 --> 12:41.402
Patient was admitted with fever,
night sweats, severe cough...

12:41.403 --> 12:42.938
I can read the chart, Dr. Kutcher.

12:42.939 --> 12:44.741
What's your diagnosis?

12:48.277 --> 12:49.278
Um...

12:51.080 --> 12:52.881
We were thinking tuberculosis.

12:52.882 --> 12:54.915
TB? Huh.

12:54.916 --> 12:56.576
Would explain the weight loss.

12:56.577 --> 12:58.201
Excellent catch, Dr. Sommers.

12:58.202 --> 13:00.888
Oh, actually, it was Dr. Kutcher
who came up with the diagnosis.

13:00.889 --> 13:02.524
Okay.

13:02.525 --> 13:04.895
Seeing some really great work
from you today, Dr. Kutcher.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.864
Nice job, man.

13:09.865 --> 13:13.068
What is wrong with you?

13:13.069 --> 13:15.771
Les chevaux mangent les fraises.

13:15.772 --> 13:19.174
Les chevaux mangent les fraises.

13:19.175 --> 13:20.441
See? Isn't that fun?

13:20.442 --> 13:21.542
Yeah. What did we just say?

13:21.543 --> 13:25.079
"The horses eat the strawberries".

13:25.080 --> 13:27.082
Well, not super helpful.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.482
I was looking for more travel stuff,

13:28.483 --> 13:30.084
like, "Where's the bathroom?"

13:30.085 --> 13:31.353
"What time is it?"

13:31.354 --> 13:33.155
"Help, my daughter's been taken".

13:33.156 --> 13:35.556
No. It's mostly horse stuff.

13:35.557 --> 13:37.526
- Mm.
- You want another coloring book?

13:37.527 --> 13:39.560
Nah. I'm kind of colored out.

13:39.561 --> 13:41.039
That tropical bird forest

13:41.040 --> 13:42.564
really took it out of me.

13:42.565 --> 13:44.324
Time really flew when
we were doing that.

13:44.325 --> 13:46.216
What's it been, like, a couple hours?

13:46.217 --> 13:48.689
- 20 minutes.
- Oh.

13:48.690 --> 13:50.940
Get ready to really relax.

13:50.941 --> 13:52.355
It's magazine time.

13:52.356 --> 13:53.923
Uh-huh.

13:53.924 --> 13:55.859
Oh.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.827
Okay. Celebrities.

14:00.264 --> 14:02.173
I am really out of the loop.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.101
Who are these people?

14:05.102 --> 14:06.836
Oh, no.

14:06.837 --> 14:08.672
Look at that girl in the bikini.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.307
Yeah, she's a dirty bird.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.066
Well, that may be true,

14:13.067 --> 14:15.690
but that spot looks like
basal cell carcinoma.

14:15.691 --> 14:17.662
Carol, you're not supposed
to practice medicine

14:17.663 --> 14:18.849
when you read these things.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.151
You're supposed to drink
a couple glasses of rosé

14:21.152 --> 14:23.820
and judge everyone.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.823
Okay, okay.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.478
And how long do we do this for?

14:27.479 --> 14:29.727
Until everyone's been judged.

14:29.728 --> 14:31.862
We need some wine.

14:31.863 --> 14:33.865
Is there any rosé in the gift shop?

14:33.866 --> 14:37.300
Uh, we discourage our patients
from drinking in the hospital.

14:37.301 --> 14:38.744
Mm. Okay, you're not into this.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.304
I know just the thing.

14:41.305 --> 14:44.483
Well, look who isn't hysterical.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.950
Just letting you know,
Tuvie's boils were approved

14:46.951 --> 14:48.278
for laser therapy treatments.

14:48.279 --> 14:50.705
Really? A carbon dioxide laser excision?

14:50.706 --> 14:52.031
Yeah. But don't worry. I got it.

14:52.032 --> 14:53.089
You stay here.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.273
Sorry.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.148
I can't miss this.

14:56.149 --> 14:58.217
I've never seen a carbon
dioxide laser excision before.

14:58.218 --> 15:00.621
It's the Rolling Stones of lasers.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.324
I really don't get it.

15:06.325 --> 15:07.360
Yeah, I'm stumped, too.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.227
Not the patient. You.

15:09.228 --> 15:11.564
First, you let me steal credit.
Then you give me credit.

15:11.565 --> 15:14.232
I mean, what kind of sick
game are you playing here?

15:14.233 --> 15:16.235
I'm not playing any game.

15:16.236 --> 15:17.669
I'm just not that competitive.

15:17.670 --> 15:20.405
Oh, I see your angle.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.842
You're trying to be
less competitive than me.

15:22.843 --> 15:25.035
No, I am less competitive than you.

15:25.036 --> 15:26.312
Right. Because we're a "team".

15:26.313 --> 15:27.346
We are a team.

15:27.347 --> 15:29.183
Oh, you are good.

15:30.349 --> 15:32.627
Daniel, we're just different, okay?

15:32.628 --> 15:34.819
I genuinely don't care
about getting credit.

15:34.820 --> 15:35.987
Since when?

15:35.988 --> 15:38.658
Not even a tiny bit of you
wants to be better than me?

15:38.659 --> 15:41.558
Look, everyone in my
family was very competitive,

15:41.559 --> 15:43.395
and it did not make them happy.

15:43.396 --> 15:46.097
My parents got divorced over
a game of Scrabble.

15:46.098 --> 15:48.701
It's just not who I want to be.

15:48.702 --> 15:50.435
So can we please just figure out

15:50.436 --> 15:52.438
what's causing Mr.
Singh's low blood sugar?

15:52.439 --> 15:56.741
Fine. But you didn't notice
the pancreatic lesion on CT?

15:56.742 --> 15:58.443
We'll have to run tests
for fasting insulin

15:58.444 --> 16:00.813
and C-peptide levels, but I'm
pretty sure it's an insulinoma.

16:00.814 --> 16:03.248
That would explain the
episodes of confusion.

16:03.249 --> 16:04.350
Good catch.

16:04.351 --> 16:06.087
Ugh, I never would have gotten that.

16:06.819 --> 16:08.254
Gentlemen!

16:08.255 --> 16:11.424
I understand Dr. Jacobs
assigned you to Mr. Singh.

16:11.425 --> 16:12.957
Tricky case.

16:12.958 --> 16:14.293
Tell you what,

16:14.294 --> 16:15.794
whoever cracks it
first joins me for lunch

16:15.795 --> 16:17.263
with the senior attendings.

16:17.264 --> 16:19.030
Pretty good opportunity
for some face time...

16:19.031 --> 16:21.199
It's an insulinoma. I mean, we'll...

16:21.200 --> 16:24.703
have to confirm with fasting
insulin and C-peptide levels,

16:24.704 --> 16:26.940
but I'm pretty sure.

16:32.045 --> 16:33.978
Insulinoma.

16:33.979 --> 16:35.380
That's genius.

16:35.381 --> 16:37.717
Well, Dr. Sommers,

16:37.718 --> 16:40.019
I hope you like steak
and vibrant conversation,

16:40.020 --> 16:42.656
because you're about to
get all you can eat of both.

16:43.957 --> 16:45.156
Uh...

16:45.157 --> 16:46.660
Caleb.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.073
What happened to "I'm not competitive"?

16:50.074 --> 16:51.609
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.610
I said I'm less competitive.

16:53.611 --> 16:55.012
Which is true.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.550
You just have to know
when to take your shots.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.444
Good job, Dr. Kenney.

17:04.445 --> 17:05.489
Thank you.

17:05.490 --> 17:08.571
Mr. Tuverson, I want you to remember

17:08.573 --> 17:10.594
that the person you're
insulting one minute

17:10.595 --> 17:13.298
could be holding a laser
to your groin the next.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.102
Sounds naughty.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.272
Still holding the laser.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.375
What happened?

17:24.376 --> 17:25.976
Did you have to say the word "stat"?

17:25.977 --> 17:28.279
They always say "stat" on TV.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.935
Yeah. Nothing that exciting.

17:30.936 --> 17:32.799
I do have the results of your MRI,

17:32.800 --> 17:34.651
and the good news is you
don't have a fracture.

17:34.652 --> 17:35.785
- Oh, that's a relief.
- Yeah.

17:35.786 --> 17:37.287
So I'm good to go?

17:37.288 --> 17:40.291
Uh, well, I also checked the
results of your blood work.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.279
I want to talk about some
elevated liver enzymes

17:43.280 --> 17:45.795
- that showed up in your labs.
- Oh, my God, it's cancer.

17:45.796 --> 17:48.264
- So this is goodbye.
- No, Phyllis,

17:48.265 --> 17:49.399
you're fine.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
Physically.

17:50.401 --> 17:52.340
Um, but levels like these

17:52.341 --> 17:54.566
can indicate that the
liver is being asked

17:54.567 --> 17:58.372
to process more alcohol
than it can handle.

17:58.373 --> 17:59.744
- Huh.
- Um, I just want

17:59.745 --> 18:01.846
to talk through your fall again.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.415
- I was doing yoga.
- Right.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.350
Um, anything else you'd like to tell me?

18:07.351 --> 18:11.121
Um, I may have had a
glass of wine first.

18:11.122 --> 18:12.289
Okay.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.758
Um, is this a daily thing?

18:14.759 --> 18:16.393
No.

18:16.394 --> 18:18.928
Maybe.

18:18.929 --> 18:20.365
Yes.

18:21.732 --> 18:23.457
I've always had a
glass of wine at dinner.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.961
But, lately, dinner has become afternoon

18:25.962 --> 18:27.637
and afternoon has become lunch.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.372
But never before lunch.

18:29.373 --> 18:30.440
Except on Sundays.

18:32.310 --> 18:34.245
Do you think you have a problem?

18:34.246 --> 18:37.181
'Cause if you need help, we
can find you some resources.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.216
Thank you, Carol.

18:38.217 --> 18:41.084
Honestly, I don't think
the problem is wine.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.320
- I think my problem is boredom.
- Mm.

18:43.321 --> 18:46.157
Wine makes yoga interesting.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.828
Wine makes a lot of things interesting.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.829
Retirement has been very hard for me.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.547
I have had no structure, no obligations.

18:54.548 --> 18:56.399
I've felt aimless.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.869
You know, I went from talking
to a-a hundred kids a day

18:58.870 --> 19:00.236
to no one.

19:00.237 --> 19:01.304
Mm.

19:01.305 --> 19:03.096
Except maybe the Amazon delivery guy,

19:03.097 --> 19:04.241
but they switch 'em up all the time,

19:04.242 --> 19:06.077
- so it's hard to make a connection.
- Yeah.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.878
But you're going to France.

19:07.879 --> 19:11.348
Yeah, for a week and
a half. And then what?

19:11.349 --> 19:13.918
You know, I looked at the
whole life you have here, and...

19:13.919 --> 19:16.387
I guess I got a little jealous.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.889
You know what's funny? I was
jealous of you today.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.457
- Me?
- Yes.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.493
I mean, I know that this hospital

19:22.494 --> 19:23.893
is the right place for me,

19:23.894 --> 19:25.729
but that doesn't mean that some days

19:25.730 --> 19:28.232
I wouldn't rather be
doing sun salutations

19:28.233 --> 19:30.736
than wiping pus from an old man's groin.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.875
Is that not true on all days?

19:37.876 --> 19:40.511
- I know it's crazy, but-but no.
- Yeah.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.346
I mean, to get through med school,

19:42.347 --> 19:44.748
you got to really love this stuff.

19:44.749 --> 19:47.008
I was lucky. I found my path.

19:47.009 --> 19:48.833
But I know you're gonna find yours.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.627
You were always the
most interesting person

19:50.628 --> 19:53.615
- on the faculty.
- Wait, what about Mr. Damelin?

19:53.616 --> 19:55.426
Don't get me started on that guy.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.619
He's living in a motor home now.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.897
Oh, so he's doing better.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.092
- Oh, Carol.
- Oh, Phyllis.

20:05.093 --> 20:06.270
- Oh.
- Oh.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.272
Oh, you two.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.875
This has been a lot.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.919
Dr. Kenney, I heard about your work

20:15.920 --> 20:18.014
with the carbon dioxide laser.

20:18.015 --> 20:19.527
Yeah. So, how did it feel?

20:19.528 --> 20:21.695
- Powerful.
- Yes, I know.

20:21.696 --> 20:23.730
There's something so satisfying

20:23.731 --> 20:25.866
about cutting off part
of another human being.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.405
Yes.

20:27.406 --> 20:29.230
If you're into skin conditions,

20:29.231 --> 20:31.569
we have a cardiac
patient who's presenting

20:31.570 --> 20:35.173
with eruptive xanthomas
that you simply must see.

20:35.174 --> 20:36.198
Dr. Frost,

20:36.199 --> 20:38.058
there is nothing I would rather do

20:38.059 --> 20:40.017
and no place I would rather be.

20:40.018 --> 20:41.809
I'm glad to hear that.

20:41.810 --> 20:44.672
This place wouldn't be
the same without you.

20:44.673 --> 20:46.698
Now, let's go see something heinous.

20:46.699 --> 20:48.468
Yes.
