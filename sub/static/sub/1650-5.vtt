WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:05.620
( barking )

00:05.798 --> 00:08.130
Come on. Get it!

00:12.346 --> 00:13.927
Thanks.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.095
Man in cap:
Thank you.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.851
Brownie: Yeah. Pack of smokes
and Brown Thunder.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.479
- Merle: Don't get cocky, boy.
- Thank you.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.514
Cold drinks?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.024
Been running
the freezers all day.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.686
Not the most practical use
of the generators to my mind.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.695
It's kind of amazing.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.073
The Governor
feels it's worth it.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.199
Well, to a great party.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.861
Now, if you would just
drop me a hint about tonight.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.782
Hmm.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.075
Mere words cannot
adequately describe

00:44.253 --> 00:45.868
the festivities ahead.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.082
Hmm.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.588
(music playing,
voices overlapping )

01:00.311 --> 01:02.427
Hey!

01:02.605 --> 01:05.096
(soft music playing )

01:17.036 --> 01:19.277
( raspy breathing )

01:22.833 --> 01:25.165
(snarling )

01:25.336 --> 01:28.043
Penny. Penny, no.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.593
Easy,Penny.
That's good.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.005
(snarling )

01:42.603 --> 01:44.343
lt's nap time now.

01:44.522 --> 01:47.434
Nap time.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.894
( growls )

01:54.824 --> 01:56.280
Penny,no.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.156
Penny.
Hey,hey,hey.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.703
Come on.
Come on.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.656
Take it easy.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.493
Hey, hey.
Come on.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.783
It's all right.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.873
- Hey, I'm here.
-( Penny moans)

02:11.632 --> 02:13.623
Daddy still loves you.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.463
You know that, right?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.673
- ( snarling )
- Hey.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.308
All right.
All right.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.469
Come on. Yeah.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.480
Hey,Penny.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.062
( Penny whines)

02:43.080 --> 02:43.114
(theme music playing )

02:43.122 --> 02:46.330
(theme music playing )

03:21.494 --> 03:23.780
(crying echoes)

03:27.333 --> 03:30.450
( panting )

03:36.926 --> 03:39.008
( muffled )
Rick, you with me?

03:39.178 --> 03:40.509
Rick?

03:45.101 --> 03:46.261
Let me see the baby.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.175
What are we
gonna feed it?

03:48.354 --> 03:49.719
We got anything
a baby can eat?

03:52.233 --> 03:54.440
The good news is
she looks healthy.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.225
But she needs formula.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.235
And soon or she
won't survive.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.897
Nope. No way.
Nothen

04:01.075 --> 04:02.906
We ain't losing nobody else.
I'm going for a run.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.613
- l'll back you up.
- I'll go, too.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.449
Okay, think where
we're going. Beth.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.705
Kid just lost his mom.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.491
- His dad ain't doing so hot.
- I'll look out for him.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.286
( muffled baby crying )

04:17.091 --> 04:18.126
You two get the fence.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.756
Too many pile up, we got
ourselves a problem.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.926
Rick!

04:29.019 --> 04:30.600
Daryl:
Get the gate.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.433
Come on, we're gonna
lose the light.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.102
There's a Piggly Wiggly
on 85.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.112
No, the baby section's
been cleared.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.444
Lori asked me to keep an eye out.
I haven't had much luck.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.325
Is there any place that hasn't been
completely looted?

04:47.496 --> 04:50.784
We saw signs for a shopping
centerjust north of here.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.289
Yeah, but there's too much
debris on the road.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.495
A car will never
get through there.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.375
I can take one of you.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.956
I'll go.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.122
No, Maggie,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.461
after everything that you've
been through, okay, I'll go.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.297
I want to go.
For Lori, l have to.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.051
Okay.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.810
I love you.
Be safe.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.144
|wi||.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.980
( revs motor )

05:34.126 --> 05:36.117
( gate screeches )

05:41.926 --> 05:43.962
( bangs)

05:44.136 --> 05:46.297
- ( snarling )
-( Rick shouts)

05:59.860 --> 06:01.771
All right.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.777
Hey.

06:03.948 --> 06:07.566
First time we gathered,
there was nine of us

06:07.743 --> 06:11.281
holed up in an apartment
with Spam and saltine crackers.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.242
Well, look at us now.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.327
( laughs)

06:16.502 --> 06:19.244
We've built a place
we can call home.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.413
May be held together
with duct tape and string,

06:22.591 --> 06:24.297
but it works.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.335
lt's ours. I'll take it.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.469
( laughs)

06:29.640 --> 06:32.222
So today

06:32.393 --> 06:34.679
we celebrate
how far we've come.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.810
We remember those
we've lost.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.978
We raise a glass... to us.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.895
( cheering )

06:47.074 --> 06:49.315
Man:
Hear, hear!

07:51.305 --> 07:53.387
(thumping)

08:20.584 --> 08:22.825
Milton: ...suggesting we delay
a couple of days.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.461
Governor: We can't wait.
Everything's ready.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.668
I love a party as much
as the next fella.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.673
Trust me,
I love a party.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.800
- But we're using a lot of resources.
- Yeah.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.427
For instance,
the generators.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.008
I thought
you love a party.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.344
Merle: Come on, Milty,
lighten up, for Christ's sake.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.010
Let your hair down, man.
Have some fun for once.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.053
- I like fun.
- Then there's no problem.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.563
If I might.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.600
You know, I've been working
on an experiment all week.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.689
It's been a challenge getting
the level of power I need.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.023
And with everything
going on tonight--

08:51.198 --> 08:52.278
What are you asking?

08:52.449 --> 08:55.316
- Postpone tonight.
- No way.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.075
Hang on.
Let's hear him out.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.736
- How long do you need?
- I don't need long.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.529
- How long?
- 10 days.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.823
- No.
- Six?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.376
- No.
- How about--

09:03.544 --> 09:05.205
How about you enjoy
yourself tonight

09:05.379 --> 09:09.088
and then begin the experiment
over in the morning, huh?

09:09.258 --> 09:12.170
Uh, yeah.
That could work.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.372
(flies buzzing )

09:45.753 --> 09:48.460
(snarling )

09:57.222 --> 10:00.259
(snarling )

10:58.617 --> 11:00.824
( exhales )

11:00.994 --> 11:02.985
( door creaks)

11:04.832 --> 11:06.242
( bangs)

11:09.711 --> 11:12.168
( door opens)

11:19.096 --> 11:21.178
You get off on that?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.017
Poking around other
people's things?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.773
Hmm?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.729
We got nothing
to hide here.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.987
People with nothing to hide

11:40.158 --> 11:42.114
don't usually
feel the need to say so.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.823
That's fair.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.786
We all have
our secrets, huh?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.126
Like Penny?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.875
You know about Penny?

12:01.847 --> 12:03.462
Then you know
I loved her.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.098
Bet you say that
about all the girls.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.194
You got the wrong
idea about me.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.616
I'm just a guy
trying to do right

12:21.783 --> 12:24.240
by the people
I care about.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.824
Now, you want to leave,
Andrea wants to stay.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.286
So you want me to take
choice out of the equation.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.997
You want me
to kick you out.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.167
Actually, I was about
to give your sword back.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.760
'Cause you fit in.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.976
We've enjoyed having you.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.191
This is a real problem
for me.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.445
People follow the rules.
And whether or not it's true,

13:09.623 --> 13:12.114
they believe it's what
keeps them alive.

13:12.292 --> 13:16.581
You've turned that
upside down.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.120
You've broken the rules.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.960
If I don't do anything,
I invite anarchy.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.626
How about this?

13:26.223 --> 13:29.135
I keep a lid
on your little outburst,

13:29.309 --> 13:31.595
you join the research team.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.557
You obviously have skills
and you're not afraid of biters.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.983
Merle will take care
of you and then--

14:08.223 --> 14:10.339
( door bangs)

14:19.026 --> 14:21.688
- Merle: How'd it go?
- ( chuckles )

14:23.864 --> 14:26.321
She's all personality,
that one.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.904
Do we have a problem?

14:30.078 --> 14:33.036
No. No.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.539
Send Andrea over to me.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.292
You can take the research team
to get more grist for the mill.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.249
I can handle this.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.209
All right.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.552
( door closes)

15:19.211 --> 15:21.167
How's the perimeter look?

15:21.338 --> 15:24.455
We got the walkers
spread out.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.793
Need help?

15:31.765 --> 15:36.680
Your friends, they--
they were good folks.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.434
They were family.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.940
I think I had one friend
like that my whole life.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.105
You got a whole group.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.656
Sorry you lost 'em.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.543
I need two more.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.047
- Rick?
- Still inside.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.637
Okay, I'll get him.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.096
A third of our group
in one day.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.391
'Cause of one asshole.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.236
Part of me wishes
that we killed

16:30.407 --> 16:33.149
all the prisoners on sight.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.120
Axel and Oscar
seem like good guys.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.450
When the evacuations started,

16:43.628 --> 16:47.166
T-Dog drove his church van to
the home of every senior he knew

16:47.340 --> 16:50.332
just in case
they needed a ride.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.594
He saved my ass
a thousand times.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.846
He wasn't just a good guy.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.598
He was the best.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.268
Got bit closing the gate.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.055
If he hadn't done that...

17:05.233 --> 17:07.269
It could have been Maggie.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.854
lt's wrong, but...

17:12.032 --> 17:15.195
l'd trade any number of people
for one of ours any day.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.880
What's wrong?
Merle said it was urgent.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.547
I need your help.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.633
- lt's Michonne.
- What about her?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.513
She broke in,
stole her weapon.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.720
She can't steal
something that's hers.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.806
Then she went into
a private place

17:43.980 --> 17:47.347
and slaughtered half a dozen
captive biters.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.358
Why would you have
captive biters?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.654
There's a good reason
I don't want to go into right now.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.155
Okay.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.066
Point is, I tried
to talk to her about it

17:58.245 --> 17:59.951
and she pulled
her sword on me.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.112
Held it to my throat.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.541
Can't imagine
that surprises you.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.371
She wouldn't do that
unless she felt threatened.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.800
She makes people
uncomfortable.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.959
Some people want her to leave
and I don't want that.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.047
lt's ugly out there and it's getting
worse every day.

18:17.222 --> 18:20.134
But she put my back
against the wall here.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.640
What are you saying?

18:22.811 --> 18:25.393
I'm saying what works out
there doesn't work in here.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.054
You know,
we're not barbarians.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.568
- We got to talk.
- We got to go.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.527
The Governor told me
what happened.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.697
Michonne, you can't
do things like this.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.581
You're freaking people out.
You're freaking me out.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.868
The northeast wall
is guarded by some girl.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.456
We can escape there
after dark.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.963
We are not
prisoners here.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.170
No one who comes
here leaves.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.925
What are you talking about?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.553
It's safe. There's food,
there's shelter.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.339
There's people,
for God's sake.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.757
That's what
they show you.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.721
But you can't leave
unless they make you.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.147
You are not making
any sense.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.476
Mich, maybe you need
to sit for a minute.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.311
You need to trust me.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.316
And you need to give
me more to go on.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.148
We got a good thing
going here.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.985
- I thought this was temporary.
- And I think we need this.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.899
I want to give
this place a real shot.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.238
- I tried.
- Breaking into houses?

19:23.413 --> 19:24.994
That is not trying.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.030
That is sabotaging.

19:31.004 --> 19:35.589
This place is not
what they say it is.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.122
Rick?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.833
Everybody's worried
aboutyou.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.127
You shouldn't be in here.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.180
Come on out.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.605
Rick.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.563
You don't have to do
this all by yourself.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.443
Okay?

20:39.614 --> 20:41.900
Our cell block
is cleared.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.987
We'll just close off
all the doors again.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.493
Rick, why don't you
just come on out with me?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.620
Okay?

20:50.959 --> 20:53.041
- Rick.
- ( grunts )

20:53.211 --> 20:55.748
( panting )

21:00.677 --> 21:03.510
( softly )
Yeah... yeah...

21:03.680 --> 21:05.887
It's me.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.287
(high-pitched whining)

22:04.991 --> 22:07.027
Hey, all right.

22:07.202 --> 22:09.318
We got us a bite.

22:09.496 --> 22:13.489
Yeah, we got us some.
Let's hook 'em up.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.908
(snarling, moaning)

22:21.341 --> 22:22.877
That's it.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.963
Ho! Ho!

22:27.138 --> 22:29.845
Ho, whoa!
Look what we got here.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.054
Come get it.
Whoa! Jeez!

22:34.229 --> 22:36.220
Look at this one.
Little too little.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.479
- We're gonna have to kill it.
- Hold on.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.857
There's something
interesting in its eyes.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.734
- So don't kill it?
- It's a maybe for me.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.066
Here you go.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.197
Get your hands
dirty for once, huh?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.029
All right. Come on.
Come on down.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.784
Let 'em down now.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.071
- Come on, Milty.
- ( winch whines)

22:55.667 --> 22:57.658
(growling)

22:59.212 --> 23:01.168
Get her, boy!
Get her!

23:01.339 --> 23:03.045
Oh, yeah!

23:03.216 --> 23:06.049
Oh! Oh, man!
ltell you what,

23:06.219 --> 23:08.380
I take back everything
I said about that jacket.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.886
Come here.
Let me see her.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.921
Let me see her.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.510
Merle, check this one out.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.394
He's almost as ugly as you.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.147
Holy shit!
Yeah, he's a mean one, huh?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.899
Look at him.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.186
Yeah, now get him down now.
Come on, get him down.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.320
Get him down.
Yeow!

23:28.491 --> 23:29.901
Easy now.
Open up, baby.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.032
Got him! Yeah!

23:32.203 --> 23:34.159
There we go.
Come on.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.866
Don't give me
no shit, boy.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.905
There.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.915
- ( motor stops)
- Company's close.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.958
Stay tight.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.321
( smashes )

25:26.693 --> 25:29.526
(faint rattling )

25:52.135 --> 25:54.217
(scratching )

26:24.041 --> 26:25.121
( hisses )

26:25.293 --> 26:26.999
( squeals )

26:27.170 --> 26:28.455
Hello, dinner.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.245
I'm not putting that
in my bag.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.382
(music playing )

26:47.440 --> 26:48.725
Merle:
Hey, hey, hey, girls.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.982
Where y'all off to
in such a hurry?

26:51.152 --> 26:53.063
Huh?

26:59.702 --> 27:01.693
Hey, come on, now.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.738
Y'all are breaking my heart
running away like that.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.747
We're leaving.

27:06.918 --> 27:09.034
It's almost curfew.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.248
I'd have to arrange
an escort.

27:11.422 --> 27:14.880
I mean, the party's
still going on.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.889
All right.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.422
Wait here a second.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.764
Brownie.
Come here.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.524
Listen up, bro.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.938
The Governor told us we were free
to come and go whenever we liked.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.901
Sweetheart,
nothing personal here,

27:43.079 --> 27:45.320
but you're gonna
have to step back.

27:53.965 --> 27:55.546
See?

27:55.716 --> 27:58.093
There's always a reason
why we can't leave yet.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.545
Clear.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.635
Now if I was y'all, I'd find some
shelter before nightfall.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.350
( gate creaks )

28:21.200 --> 28:24.488
They knew we were coming.
This was all for show.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.699
Do you hear yourself?
How can you know that?

28:27.874 --> 28:29.739
And why would they bother?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.659
- Ladies.
- Close the gates.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.202
No.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.245
l practically begged
the Governor to let you stay.

28:36.424 --> 28:37.914
- I didn't ask for that.
- You didn't have to.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.957
That's what friends
do for each other.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.501
It goes both ways.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.135
So you want to
run around out there

28:43.306 --> 28:44.967
with walkers
on chains eating twigs?

28:45.141 --> 28:47.052
- Is that right?
- We held our own.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.593
Eight months. Eight months on
the road moving place to place,

28:50.771 --> 28:52.807
scavenging,
living in a meat locker.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.893
That was no life.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.274
I'm tired. I'm tired.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.312
I don't have another eight
months in me. Not like that.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.616
And you, I...

29:04.118 --> 29:06.404
What about me?

29:06.579 --> 29:08.740
I'm afraid you're
gonna disappear.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.082
We always talked about
this place, didn't we?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.788
A refuge.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.624
That idea is what
kept us going.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.961
Are you coming or not?

29:27.767 --> 29:30.804
Don't do this.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.593
Don't give me
an ultimatum.

29:32.772 --> 29:33.761
Not after everything.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.807
Are you coming or not?

29:44.867 --> 29:46.949
You'd just
slow me down anyway.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.662
Michonne!

30:02.969 --> 30:05.255
( bangs)

30:36.544 --> 30:39.411
I'm sorry things didn't work out
with your friend.

30:43.843 --> 30:47.006
Weird to lose someone
by their own choice.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.046
Thought those days
had gone.

30:52.143 --> 30:53.849
Not sure this will
make you feel better,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.762
but I'm sure you
could use a drink.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.725
Some company.

31:00.818 --> 31:03.150
Something to take your mind
off of it for a bit.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.609
Come on.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.370
(snarling )

31:22.548 --> 31:25.585
( motor roars )

31:25.760 --> 31:26.920
Guys, they're back!

31:27.094 --> 31:28.800
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

31:28.971 --> 31:30.552
You want some of this?
Come on!

31:30.723 --> 31:32.839
Come on!

31:36.270 --> 31:38.886
( gunshots)

31:39.065 --> 31:41.226
Axel: You want some of this?
Come on! Come on!

31:44.445 --> 31:46.276
( baby crying )

31:46.447 --> 31:48.233
Beth.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.698
Daryl:
How's she doing?

31:54.080 --> 31:56.492
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

31:59.168 --> 32:01.409
Shh...

32:13.682 --> 32:15.593
Come on.
Come on.

32:15.768 --> 32:19.101
(crying stops)

32:20.356 --> 32:22.142
( chuckles )

32:27.279 --> 32:28.485
She got a name yet?

32:28.656 --> 32:30.897
Not yet.

32:31.075 --> 32:34.533
But I was thinking
maybe Sophia.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.945
Then there's Carol, too.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.915
And...

32:42.086 --> 32:43.826
( sighs )
Andrea.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.210
Amy.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.838
Jacqui

32:48.008 --> 32:50.465
Patricia.

32:50.636 --> 32:55.471
Or... Lori.
I don't know.

32:59.186 --> 33:02.474
Yeah...
You like that? Huh?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.684
Little ass-kicker.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.604
Right? That's a good
name, right?

33:08.779 --> 33:11.395
Little ass-kicker.
You like that, huh?

33:11.574 --> 33:13.986
You like that, sweetheart?

34:07.129 --> 34:09.370
(faint grunting)

34:13.552 --> 34:16.009
(snarling )

34:39.161 --> 34:41.777
(grunts)

34:50.631 --> 34:52.747
- ( screams)
- ( gunshot)

35:45.311 --> 35:48.018
(grunting)

35:48.188 --> 35:51.055
(shouting )

35:56.322 --> 35:59.029
( music blaring )
J‘ Like a black cat do J‘

35:59.199 --> 36:02.862
J‘ Two bodies laying naked J‘

36:03.037 --> 36:06.746
J‘ Creeper think he got
nothing to lose J‘

36:06.915 --> 36:10.157
J‘ So he creeps
into this house... J‘

36:10.336 --> 36:12.827
Hey! How are you?
Come on up here.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.087
Come on, this way.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.044
I've got the best seats
in the house.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.379
Hey, how you doing?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.504
Yeah! Whoo!

36:23.682 --> 36:26.845
J‘ It's a Saturday night
special J‘

36:27.019 --> 36:29.601
J‘ Got a barrel
that's blue and cold... J‘

36:29.772 --> 36:31.353
Forget about it.
Come on.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.849
It's a little loud.

36:37.196 --> 36:40.188
- ( music ends)
- ( cheering )

36:40.366 --> 36:42.197
- Come on!
- I don't feel--

36:42.368 --> 36:44.700
- ( music blaring )
- ( cheering )

36:50.209 --> 36:52.700
Come on! Whoo!

36:54.296 --> 36:57.663
- ( music continues)
- ( cheering )

37:01.178 --> 37:03.715
Yeah!

37:11.271 --> 37:13.557
( chanting )
Merle! Merle! Merle!

37:13.732 --> 37:16.474
Merle! Merle!
Merle!

37:19.780 --> 37:23.739
I'm gonna kick
his ass one-handed.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.742
Oh, the hell with it.
No-handed!

37:26.912 --> 37:28.903
Yeah!
( grunts )

37:29.081 --> 37:31.743
- Yeah!
- ( cheering )

37:31.917 --> 37:33.327
Whoo!

37:33.502 --> 37:35.584
No hands!

37:35.754 --> 37:37.915
Bring it on.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.257
(snarling )

37:44.430 --> 37:46.261
All right,
let's get it on!

37:46.432 --> 37:48.923
( cheering )

37:53.564 --> 37:55.896
( whistle tweets )

37:58.444 --> 38:00.435
Yeah!
Come on!

38:00.612 --> 38:03.069
Come on, get up.
Gaup

38:03.240 --> 38:05.322
Want some more?

38:09.037 --> 38:11.653
( snarls )

38:11.832 --> 38:15.620
He's got nothing.
Nothing, folks.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.464
- Get up.
- Come on!

38:22.634 --> 38:24.249
Okay, come on.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.681
Whoo!

38:35.564 --> 38:37.395
- ( blows whistle )
- Hey!

38:37.566 --> 38:38.851
Come on,
let 'em fight.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.481
( crowd booing )

38:45.699 --> 38:48.406
Merle: Come on, pretty boy.
Let's dance.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.578
Hey, hey!
Where you going?

38:57.753 --> 38:58.742
What the hell is this?

38:58.921 --> 39:01.082
It's a way
to blow off steam.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.507
Blow off steam?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.050
You go for a jog
to blow off steam.

39:04.218 --> 39:05.924
This is-- this is sick.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.346
Look around.
Everyone's having a great time.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.425
lt's barbaric.

39:15.312 --> 39:16.893
( quietly )
lt's staged.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.304
( laughs)

39:18.482 --> 39:20.518
Yeah, we pull out
the biter's teeth.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.023
It's just all for show.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.730
(snarling )

39:23.904 --> 39:25.690
That's crazy.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.525
This is your reason
for keeping walkers around?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.200
People need entertainment.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.983
So your solution
is gladiator fights?

39:31.161 --> 39:33.868
We're reducing these things.
We're controlling them.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.826
We're shining a light on
the monster under the bed.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.581
It's fun.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.708
It makes people feel better
about the whole thing.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.210
It's a slippery slope.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.417
You're teaching them
that walkers aren't dangerous.

39:44.591 --> 39:47.207
We're teaching them
not to be afraid.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.763
Come on, baby.

40:01.525 --> 40:03.390
Come on.
Walk it off, huh?

40:08.991 --> 40:11.107
Uno!

40:11.285 --> 40:13.492
Dos!

40:13.662 --> 40:15.243
- Tres!
- ( whistle blows )

40:15.414 --> 40:18.076
( crowd cheering )

41:36.745 --> 41:39.657
( baby's crying echoes )

41:48.840 --> 41:51.092
(phone ringing)

41:54.680 --> 41:57.387
(ringing continues)

42:18.954 --> 42:20.945
