the squirrel for jaywalking...

01:08.368 --> 01:09.960
annoyed at Steve for losing his pants...

01:10.070 --> 01:12.129

Why is that the only
emotion you can express?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.189
Well, music makes you feel things...

03:18.298 --> 03:22.257
and your dad's a bit of
an emotional tight-ass, and a literal one.

03:22.368 --> 03:27.067

No.

Stan, you're scaring me.

12:52.920 --> 12:57.152

Look, there's clearly something special
between you and this Jim James fellow.

13:17.577 --> 13:20.307
It's more than that.
It's like we're soul mates.

for nine months in the same womb stew...

on tour with My Morning Jacket?

13:35.462 --> 13:37.362
I have to meet Jim James.

13:37.464 --> 13:40.058
He understands me
in a way that no one else does.

You're right. Traffic. I should go.
