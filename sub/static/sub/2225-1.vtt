01:10.203 --> 01:12.797
13 more installments and the
car is mine.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.430
Check it out, Chavelo,
I made it start myself!

02:17.170 --> 02:21.163
What is it, asshole? Get down,
shithead! Come on, get down!

02:21.274 --> 02:22.798
- What...?
- Get down, jerk!

02:22.942 --> 02:24.375
What is it?

02:29.315 --> 02:32.443
Chose, you tideass:
steer or trunk.

02:35.321 --> 02:39.519
I got 1,000 pesos from de first
round. That's all I got.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.355
I said steer or trunk.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.690
- Steer.
- Okay, let's get outta here.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.298
Coto, move over!

02:57.510 --> 03:01.310
Ok, cab driver. Go straight
down and you better watch out...

03:01.414 --> 03:03.609
...l'll tell you where to stop.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.221
So, how's the job?

03:14.928 --> 03:18.091
If it was good, I wouldn't bring
passengers here.

03:20.366 --> 03:24.166
We thought this car could
only get this far.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.174
Problems with the start engine?

03:28.875 --> 03:32.003
I'm still paying it and it's already
giving me trouble.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.176
Imagine it...

03:36.216 --> 03:39.242
If everything could be fixed
the way you fix things...

03:40.386 --> 03:42.013
...with a hammer...

03:42.355 --> 03:43.515
...that'd be something!

03:45.291 --> 03:50.752
Alright, gentlemen...
Let's work!

03:55.868 --> 04:00.271
A CAB FOR THREE

04:00.907 --> 04:04.365
A film by
ORLANDO LUBBERT

04:13.920 --> 04:16.047
We'd give our lives for them.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.291
Cotito grew up by himself, that's
why I show him the way.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.896
Today's the bastard's debut.

04:30.270 --> 04:36.072
The best school in life is still the
street... Way better!

04:37.410 --> 04:39.310
Slow down, cabby!

04:40.780 --> 04:42.577
Slow down, slow down!

04:43.583 --> 04:45.915
Hey! Look!
Look over there!

04:47.620 --> 04:49.247
- You see?
- The old lady?

04:49.489 --> 04:50.251
Stop!

04:52.425 --> 04:54.518
C'mon, kiddo, do it!

04:57.297 --> 05:00.596
Listen, where are you going
with that hammer?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.936
I don't like what
you're thinking, cabby.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.006
- I'm not a cab driver.
- No?

05:07.106 --> 05:09.768
A hostage, mugged just
like the poor old lady.

05:09.942 --> 05:13.173
Still I don't like what you're
thinking.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.541
Hurry, Coto!
It's just an old lady!

05:17.650 --> 05:19.277
She won't let go!

05:20.653 --> 05:23.952
Leave her alone, she's just
a poor old lady.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.617
- I don't want to hear that.
- Cool it, easy...

05:26.726 --> 05:28.694
Get ready to bust outta here!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.628
C'mon, go!

05:35.735 --> 05:38.636
- Go, cab driver!
- Let's go, get outta here!

05:38.738 --> 05:41.764
Get outta here or
or I'll rip the roof to pieces!

05:46.312 --> 05:47.336
The red light!

05:47.447 --> 05:50.814
Careful with the red light!
Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!

05:55.021 --> 05:59.651
Stop, we know you can drive,
madman! Stop, cabdriver!

06:01.694 --> 06:03.127
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.388
Watch it! Are you a bus driver?

06:07.100 --> 06:07.998
Asshole!

06:15.007 --> 06:16.167
Fuck you!

06:38.331 --> 06:40.697
Cool, Fitipaldi!

06:41.734 --> 06:47.695
Fitipaldi, Fitipaldi!

06:47.807 --> 06:50.867
Fitipaldi, Fitipaldi, Fitipaldi!

06:51.811 --> 06:53.779
Fitipaldi, Fitipaldi!

06:59.085 --> 07:03.044
One buck for Cotito, one buck
for me, one for Fitipaldi.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.884
- One buck for me...
- Hey, teach me how to drive.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.223
...one for Fitipaldi.
- I wanna drive like you.

07:09.328 --> 07:13.230
- One for me, another one for you,
another for Fitipaldi. - Hey, man!

07:13.332 --> 07:17.268
One buck for Cotito,
one for me, one for Fitipaldi.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.562
The lady had like 60,000 with her.

08:02.014 --> 08:02.912
Well...

08:04.817 --> 08:06.284
...where do I leave you?

08:06.385 --> 08:09.286
What? We're just starting, cabdriver!

08:09.989 --> 08:13.789
- Well, but I'm through!
- Ahhh!

08:14.060 --> 08:15.960
Besides. I don't like this at all!

08:18.898 --> 08:20.297
Neither do I.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.200
The cops.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.807
Alright, here's your share.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.875
No, no, no, don't give anything.
I'm not a thug. Keep your money.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.183
Money is money. What is fair is fair.
You're working with us now.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.811
Working? Have you forgotten
I'm being mugged?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.661
Here's what we owe you then, son.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.821
Next time turn the meter on.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.267
What if I took you to the cops?

09:00.373 --> 09:04.503
I'd cut your throat and the
car's roof would stain.

09:06.546 --> 09:11.677
You really wanna know?
Let's go back to the market.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.183
- Fitipaldi...
- I can't help loving you...

09:18.291 --> 09:20.851
- Fitipaldi...
- I can't help loving you...

09:20.960 --> 09:24.919
- Fitipaldi...
- I can't help loving you...

09:25.031 --> 09:29.866
- Fitipladi... - I can't help loving
you. - Fitipaldi.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.369
- I can't help loving you.
- Fitipaldi.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.804
C'mon, don't.
What do you want blankets for?

09:36.909 --> 09:40.345
- To cover ourselves. It's cold.
- You'll make me lose my job!

09:40.446 --> 09:42.744
Hey, don't get any closer!
I sting!

09:45.585 --> 09:49.214
Who's gonna believe I got mugged?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.285
Don't you worry, son,
we believe you.

09:52.391 --> 09:56.555
- At least cut me! -Beat it!
- At least a small cut. - Bye!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.892
- Bye!
- Cut him already!

10:01.233 --> 10:02.894
- At least a small cut!
- Bye!

10:03.002 --> 10:04.970
A straight cut is no big deal.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.299
I got all stained with blood!

10:14.747 --> 10:18.843
- This one's for you.
- No, not the green one!

10:18.951 --> 10:21.647
- Why not?
- It reminds me of the cops.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.917
He didn't even ask for the blankets.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.083
He only asked you for a small cut!

10:27.193 --> 10:31.459
- Not "you". He asked "us"!
- Just a cut, so they'd believe him.

10:31.564 --> 10:35.864
You said it yourself, he didn't care
about the blankets.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.993
He said:
"What do you want them for?"

10:38.104 --> 10:41.437
Tell me! Would you have
given them back if he'd asked?

10:41.540 --> 10:45.601
Are you nuts? Give that asshole
the blankets back?

10:45.711 --> 10:49.442
Sure. You mug me, offer me half
the money and you think...

10:49.548 --> 10:53.882
...I don't get your game, assholes?
- Tell us, what game?

10:53.986 --> 10:57.114
Lowlives, lowlives, bullies.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.989
The bully is the asshole he has
to show the cut to.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.290
That bastard's a bully.
We're just middlemen.

11:04.397 --> 11:10.199
Middlemen my balls!
Muggers, assholes, vulgar...

11:10.302 --> 11:13.965
...muggers. That's what you are,
you vile, lowlives, vulgar...

11:14.073 --> 11:16.200
...you steal from your own people.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.376
Did your friends leave?

11:24.183 --> 11:28.779
Friends? They took me as a hostage
early this morning.

11:29.288 --> 11:33.315
Hostage? Why don't you run away
now? Nobody sees you.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.260
If I'm not back in 5 minutes,
they'll cut the seats of my Lada.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.027
But it's not for my problems
that I'm here. I...

11:42.134 --> 11:46.002
...convinced them what they're doing
was fucked up. - They're muggers.

11:46.105 --> 11:50.007
Yes, first they were gonna give you
two blankets, but...

11:50.109 --> 11:54.011
...if they caught you, you'd be
screwed. - So?

11:54.947 --> 11:58.849
What d'you mean so? Leave that
wound alone, man!

11:58.984 --> 12:02.010
You should cover it,
it makes me nervous.

12:02.188 --> 12:06.022
The youngest got scared stiff, he
didn't have the guts to cut me.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.356
- Lf he had to, he'd cut your arm off.
- You think so?

12:13.466 --> 12:18.028
Listen, kiddo,
what these guys want...

12:18.137 --> 12:19.934
...is to rob your boss.

12:23.008 --> 12:29.436
Give them the address, you'll get a
share, they'll take care of everything.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.712
You can leave the tricycle in the
small shop.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.377
Rob my boss?

12:35.921 --> 12:42.724
Yes. You can always say you
were robbed.

12:46.098 --> 12:51.900
C'mon, boy, let's go before
they fuck up my Lada.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.744
They keep the money at an office,
next to the counter.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.743
The old man in glasses knows.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.749
Alright, you two be ready
to get out of here.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.091
Hey, mister, thank you.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.427
On top of all,
the asshole thanks me.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.006
- Hey, are you hungry?
- A little.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.112
- Shall we go eat something there?
- Yeah.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.186
- Is that okay?
- A little thicker, please.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.355
Put chili on it, please.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.138
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.156
Damn!

14:24.263 --> 14:25.560
Run, asshole!

14:41.213 --> 14:42.840
Quick, hurry, cab driver!

14:42.948 --> 14:46.349
Why the fuck didn't you say
they had a gun?

14:46.452 --> 14:49.751
Why didn't you say the
assholes had guns?

14:49.889 --> 14:54.588
- You almost got us killed!
- Go, cab driver!

15:05.571 --> 15:08.768
We almost got killed!

15:08.874 --> 15:10.569
Quiet! Quiet!

15:11.310 --> 15:16.373
Quiet! Give him the fourth as we
agreed and let's go.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.218
His share, man, his share's missing.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.786
50 bucks.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.390
Give him the 50 bucks
and let's get outta here.

15:26.926 --> 15:27.688
50 bucks.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.564
Go to the hospital, have them check
that wound. Tell them a couple of...

15:36.669 --> 15:38.569
...mongoloids mugged you.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.799
A lot of money, considering
he didn't do much.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.055
- Chavelo, I'm hungry.
- So what?

15:59.725 --> 16:00.589
Here, kiddo.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.995
Hey, Coto, tell him.

16:05.631 --> 16:09.590
We fooled the boy. We scared the
shit out of the old man...

16:09.702 --> 16:11.260
...and he opened immediately
the safe.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.662
Two grands, two.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.276
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

16:18.410 --> 16:22.278
To give the kid his share.
The 4th part.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.939
Look, blood from the
old man.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.282
Assholes.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.091
He opened the safe because it
was connected to the...

16:33.192 --> 16:36.457
...alarm, that's why they ran after
you. - What alarm?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.090
- You gave him 50 bucks.
- Yes.

16:40.199 --> 16:43.794
You must give him 450.
That's fair.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.302
- You want me to slit your throat?
- Chavelo...

16:47.573 --> 16:49.666
This asshole has a knife on me!

16:52.011 --> 16:55.310
What a smart cookie.
Who would have thought?

16:55.814 --> 16:56.906
Asshole.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.681
I bet the asshole thanks me again.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.351
Thank you.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.025
I don't know about you, but I'm
bored of working.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.355
So let's take the stuff
to your place.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.587
- My place?
- Then we'll go to ours.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.693
- And why mine first?
- Just think.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.045
Ulises, you brought blankets,
what a surprise!

18:12.157 --> 18:14.352
Listen, one question
and I'll hit you!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.623
Hey, mum, Carlos' staying for dinner!

19:23.795 --> 19:25.695
Carolina's also staying!

19:33.839 --> 19:38.469
Here begins an adventure
we want you to witness...

19:38.577 --> 19:40.272
It's Javiera's turn to serve.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.043
- Amaro, go get the bread.
- I did it last time!

19:44.416 --> 19:46.884
And I cooked the last time.

19:47.052 --> 19:48.883
It's always me.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.822
May I also bring some Coke?

19:51.924 --> 19:54.484
No Coke today.
Just water.

19:54.593 --> 19:58.324
- Sure, today's the 20th.
- The Lada's installment...

19:58.597 --> 20:01.088
We entered the aquatic phase:
soup and water.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.430
I bought Coke.
Dad gave me the money.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.003
Bring the Coke, Amaro,
and stop the talking.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.035
And me, saving like a fool.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.504
- May I ask without being kicked?
- No.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.747
- You should've bounced it here.
- Quiet. They're talking about UFOs.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.679
You threw Coke on the TV, Amaro.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.510
Come throw with us the
first stone...

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
...the sound of which when
reaching the bottom...

20:25.457 --> 20:29.188
...will throw light over the
existence of other lives.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.526
Ulises, look me in the eyes.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.698
Is this money from the horses track?

20:40.806 --> 20:43.036
It's no wonder...

20:43.208 --> 20:46.143
...this modern industrial area...

20:46.278 --> 20:50.476
...caught our alien friends'
attention...

20:50.582 --> 20:54.951
...and that they used it as a
landing strip.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.215
That's maybe the reason
this is one of the places...

20:58.323 --> 21:01.622
...where UFOs have been most seen
in the last 15 years.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.455
"Run"! I told the mugged kid
and we got in the cab.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.763
I started the engine and
waited for the others.

21:10.869 --> 21:14.305
Then I heard the two first shots,
pal. I speeded up...

21:14.406 --> 21:17.569
...and got outta there.
These two...

21:17.676 --> 21:21.373
...just couldn't believe it, pal.
- How much did you make?

21:23.282 --> 21:27.514
I could have fucked them up,
but I didn't want to.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.385
They would've fucked up the Lada.
And I would spend more than...

21:31.490 --> 21:33.856
...a year in Court Houses.
- Forget it.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.725
Besides, do we solve the problem
of delinquency? Of course not.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.593
The problem's deeper than that.

21:40.766 --> 21:45.601
- It's with politicians. - It's not.
Problem's wealth badly distributed.

21:45.704 --> 21:49.071
It's in the values we give
to our kids since...

21:49.174 --> 21:53.110
...they are born. - It's in badly
distributed wealth, believe me.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.806
If I tell my kids not to assault
cabs...

21:56.915 --> 21:59.884
...they won't do it. - You instil
your authority as a father.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.613
If I get back home
every day at 1 1...

22:02.721 --> 22:05.554
...what can I tell my boy if he's
already sleeping?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.616
Teachers should do that.
Otherwise...

22:10.228 --> 22:13.129
...when they grow old, there's
nothing you can do about it.

22:13.231 --> 22:15.859
- That's useless
- It depends on how you do it.

22:15.967 --> 22:19.528
Someone must set the limits.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.606
From here on, off with their heads.

22:22.641 --> 22:27.044
Fine, but when they're small.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.461
Your draft.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.329
Thank you.

22:50.535 --> 22:55.666
You know, ma'am, I want to pay
another one in advance.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.074
There's nothing like a
peaceful night sleep.

22:59.745 --> 23:04.011
There's nothing like having money.
Peace comes alone then.

23:04.883 --> 23:08.341
You said it, considering the
times we're living in...

23:09.488 --> 23:14.016
You know what? I'll make one
voucher for both drafts.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.354
Yeah, thanks.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.373
Alright...

23:29.441 --> 23:31.966
- Will you sign here, Mr. Ulises?
- Yeah, thank you.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.174
Alright.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.313
- Your drafts and your voucher.
Thank you. - Thank you.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.920
Steer or trunk.

24:24.696 --> 24:27.494
A small one for me, please.
But very juicy.

24:30.602 --> 24:34.094
I'm Raimundo Padilla, from the
Antiasasults Brigade.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.902
My cousin Julian told me
your story.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.770
Excuse me! I didn't offer you.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.107
You chose the steering wheel.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.719
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.
I just got tempted.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.519
You chose steering wheel, they
said.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.856
Yes, I say so many things.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.429
- I just said I smoked and...
- You did?

25:00.832 --> 25:05.963
Yes, I tell stories. Your cousin
Julian also does.

25:06.104 --> 25:09.665
Has he told you the one about the
stuttering pimp?

25:09.774 --> 25:12.641
- No. - Ask him.
- I will.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.678
Listen, can I take a
look at your car?

25:17.716 --> 25:18.808
Yeah, sure.

25:20.252 --> 25:24.985
You know what? Why don't we
better take a ride on it?

25:25.290 --> 25:26.348
What do you say?

25:26.525 --> 25:27.822
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.394
- So long.
- So long.

25:40.272 --> 25:44.174
We'll go to La Florida.
A lady there sold a...

25:44.309 --> 25:48.177
...sandwich to a cab driver
they say looks like you.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.248
Armed robbery, 5 million...

25:54.553 --> 25:55.815
That's a lot of money!

26:12.571 --> 26:14.198
Here I am again.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.367
Yes, may I help you?

26:17.475 --> 26:22.435
Here's my cab driver friend, he says
he never had one of your sandwiches.

26:23.448 --> 26:26.542
Come a little closer, don Ulises.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.785
Look at her, she won't brake.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.954
I've never seen this man.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.834
Curly hair, not too tall, that's the
description you gave us.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.235
- Why don't you take a better look?
- Yes, but...

26:48.340 --> 26:52.572
...l've seen so many like him... And
considering I was against the light...

26:53.111 --> 26:55.341
You mean you've never seen
this man?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.578
I can swear it.

27:03.221 --> 27:06.384
I got hungry from waiting so long.
I'd like...

27:06.491 --> 27:09.983
...a roast beef sandwich.
With a lot of chili.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.495
I want one too, but without chili.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.928
It's bad for my stomach.
I've got duodenal ulcer.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.934
Duodenal ulcer!

27:19.137 --> 27:22.595
You know? Give me your address
just in case someone around...

27:22.707 --> 27:25.938
...has a good memory stroke.
Tell me.

27:26.645 --> 27:31.947
Hector Ahumada 1610. Cerro Navia.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.288
Thinner, please.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.292
- Is that alright?
- That's perfect.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.987
They are ugly, awful,
and also crooked.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.496
- Crooked?
- Yeah, they are crooked. Look.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.758
Mum called the dentist for
an appointment...

28:22.200 --> 28:25.397
...nobody'll ever look at me again.

28:25.670 --> 28:29.162
I wish my parents had worried so
much about my teeth, dear.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.675
At my age you had pimples.
That's bad enough.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.683
Damn!

28:47.592 --> 28:49.355
Nunoa Square, please.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.195
Dad, I need money for the dentist.
Didn't mum tell you?

29:02.307 --> 29:03.604
I ain't got a penny.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.871
Didn't mum tell you anything?
I must go.

29:10.482 --> 29:13.974
Go to the dentist. Tell him I'll go
by tomorrow...

29:14.085 --> 29:15.712
...to pay him, okay? C'mon, go.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.056
- I would've preferred your pimples.
- Have a nice time.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.732
You're looking well, cab driver.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.067
Hey, your daughter's a cutie.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.293
I bet she looks like her mother.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.570
They say business is bad.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.240
Did you miss us, cabby?

29:46.451 --> 29:50.410
We've been thinking about the
last time we worked together...

29:50.522 --> 29:52.490
...and what you told us, remember?

29:52.590 --> 29:56.082
- The time you assaulted me?
- We think you're right.

29:56.194 --> 29:59.254
You called us low life thugs,
bullies, vulgars.

29:59.364 --> 30:02.492
You called us miserables.
You were pretty harsh.

30:02.667 --> 30:06.228
We got the point. We're in the year
2000 and times change.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.773
If we don't change, we're lost.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.774
- No more knife.
- Put that down.

30:11.876 --> 30:15.312
Yeah, son. You gave us
the push...

30:15.413 --> 30:19.110
...we needed. So we're ready to
work together again.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.276
- Work together?
- Yeah.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.782
- You're gonna assault me again?
- Listen, we never assaulted you.

30:25.890 --> 30:29.291
You threatened me with the trunk
and then with the knife.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.857
- You take everything so seriously.
- Take it as you want, but...

30:33.965 --> 30:37.196
...here we are again to
work professionally...

30:37.302 --> 30:40.669
...as it should be, doing things
your way, you get it?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.467
Few things but well done.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.599
And we'll rob the rich, not the poor.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.540
Choose, steer or trunk?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.009
Steer.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.310
Cool!

30:53.985 --> 30:58.319
Fitipaldi... Fitipaldi...

30:58.423 --> 31:02.154
- C'mon! Cut the shit!
With one condition. - Okay.

31:02.627 --> 31:08.088
"If you don't do what we tell you,
we'll kill your loved ones."

31:08.199 --> 31:11.498
- "All your loved ones." -No, not all
of them. Not all of them.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.161
"Your loved ones."

31:15.673 --> 31:18.506
- Okay?
- "Loved" is spelled with "v".

31:21.546 --> 31:24.743
Are you for autenticity
or embel... ment?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.180
Embel... what?

31:26.618 --> 31:30.520
I'm writing it this way so they
won't think you wrote it.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.581
Right.

32:09.928 --> 32:14.888
C'mon! Hurry, Cotito! Hurry, Cotito!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

32:16.267 --> 32:18.235
What, what, what...

32:24.609 --> 32:26.133
- Listen...
- C'mon!

32:26.244 --> 32:29.236
Hey, kiddo! So?
How much did we make?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.887
Are you fucking with me?

33:50.695 --> 33:51.992
I'm not.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.998
Is this all there was?

33:58.102 --> 34:01.333
Well, I looked in the drawer.
She said that was all.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.873
- And you believed it?
- Yes, she wouldn't lie!

34:03.975 --> 34:07.672
- I threatened her! -Sure,
she wouldn't lie... Asshole.

34:07.779 --> 34:12.545
They all lie. I've told you so many
times, jerk. They all lie!

34:12.650 --> 34:16.016
I looked in the bedroom,
I couldn't go all over the house.

34:16.454 --> 34:21.687
Look, cabby, check out the shit
he brought. Just shit. Look, look...

34:21.793 --> 34:24.694
...crayons. The shit.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.034
- Asshole!
- Stop it!

34:32.070 --> 34:34.038
We're lousy!

34:39.077 --> 34:42.103
Listen, Coto, didn't you
want to learn how to drive?

34:42.980 --> 34:46.710
Slower, slower, slower.
Careful, slower, slower.

34:46.818 --> 34:50.379
Careful there!
Watch it! Turn now!

34:50.487 --> 34:52.547
We suck as thieves.

34:52.657 --> 34:55.784
You're holding the wheel too hard!
Relax, slower.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.726
Lousy breed.
Lousy breed.

34:58.896 --> 35:03.390
Turn, turn, turn!
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

35:06.437 --> 35:10.464
You have to lose the clutch softer.
Careful with your foot.

35:10.575 --> 35:14.909
And the steering wheel, you're too
tight, you must relax.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.913
But I've been watching how
you drive.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.950
Fitipaldi... Fitipaldi...

35:56.053 --> 35:58.954
Check out how he pukes!

36:03.494 --> 36:05.121
Fitipaldi!

36:05.897 --> 36:08.457
If you eat, at least you
have something to throw up.

36:08.566 --> 36:11.535
Dad, I don't wanna have
braces like Javiera.

36:11.636 --> 36:15.333
Don't bother your dad. He's got a
stomackache from eating junk...

36:15.439 --> 36:19.432
...all day. - Why do we have to wear
braces? -Revenge.

36:19.544 --> 36:23.105
Dad wants us to look as ridiculous
as he did when he was a child.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.808
- Don't even think I'll wear braces!
- Your dad thinks...

36:26.918 --> 36:30.217
...all of you will.
- I'll run away from home.

36:30.321 --> 36:33.984
- I'll keep your bed, it's bigger
than mine. - I don't care.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.157
Who could it be this late?

36:38.329 --> 36:39.819
No, I'll get it.

36:41.866 --> 36:45.563
It must be for Javiera, she's got
many admirers. Maybe...

36:45.670 --> 36:49.663
...those punks from
the other day. Or Felipe.

36:49.774 --> 36:52.504
- Why so envious? It's Solange.
- Of course...

36:52.610 --> 36:53.508
What is it?

36:56.714 --> 37:00.673
They tell me a colleague is ill.
I gotta take him to the hospital.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.346
I'm going out, bye.

37:05.890 --> 37:09.189
Yes, it's for you. You change
boyfriends every 5 minutes.

37:19.870 --> 37:25.001
Excuse the mess, cab driver, but
the maid hasn't come for days.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.374
What about this cab?

37:27.478 --> 37:30.879
It belongs to a cab driver
who pissed us off.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.541
He chose the trunk.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.548
Listen. So? Here's where you
keep the money?

37:40.258 --> 37:43.716
They may catch me, but not the loot.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.631
Coto asked for you.
That's why I called you.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.223
And where's the kiddo?

37:51.602 --> 37:52.364
Let's go.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.568
I'll be right away.

38:13.157 --> 38:14.055
Coto?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.488
How are you, kid?

38:22.133 --> 38:24.260
I was dreaming about my
childhood, when...

38:25.136 --> 38:29.596
...I used to fly kites with my dad.
- Chavelo said you grew up alone.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.267
But I once had a Dad... and a mum.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.443
Until they took them away.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.012
To jail?

38:40.484 --> 38:41.280
The cops?

38:42.653 --> 38:43.620
No.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.751
They never came back.

38:48.326 --> 38:53.628
And I never looked for them,
'cause I'm a coward.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.701
Now you have money,
you can look for them.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.139
I'm saving money for college.
I want to study.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.645
A couple of hits more
and I'll study.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.113
Journalism. You like it?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.982
What did your Dad do?

39:19.090 --> 39:22.059
They say journalists travel around
the world.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.158
My Dad flew kites very well.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.109
At last I find you.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.109
Last time you forgot your
change and your bill.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.611
600 pesos. Your change.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.382
1,400 the two sandwiches. You
gave me 2,000, remember?

40:32.930 --> 40:35.899
Are you gonna just stand there?

40:37.835 --> 40:41.566
Hey, not that far.
I told you... just a kiss.

40:41.672 --> 40:44.402
Just a kiss!

40:44.508 --> 40:47.739
Take that slippery and cold
thing away from me!

40:50.448 --> 40:52.075
Damn, the peaches!

40:52.183 --> 40:55.414
You spilled the can, the ants
will come now.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.586
With this smell?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.083
Must be yours...

41:04.295 --> 41:05.694
- Listen...
- What?

41:05.796 --> 41:08.594
- Tell me about those hits.
- What hits?

41:08.699 --> 41:11.759
- The hits, like the one of the
other day. - What hits?

41:14.104 --> 41:17.767
Ulises Morales!
Take your hands off! It tickles!

41:20.978 --> 41:24.277
I saw the two guards with the guns,
I got in the cab and...

41:25.382 --> 41:28.943
...turned fast. I felt the two first
shots pretty close.

41:29.053 --> 41:32.784
I didn't hear the other ones. I was
far away in no time with the Lada.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.128
You saved their lives!

41:41.098 --> 41:42.122
I did.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.736
No bill, okay?

41:53.677 --> 41:54.803
I'm sorry.

42:10.194 --> 42:14.324
Thanks, it's beautiful.
To write the bills.

42:23.173 --> 42:27.166
Money is what interests me, baby.
I'm interested in money.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.174
Where they keep it,
where the others live.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.509
How many times do
I have to tell you?

42:36.387 --> 42:39.015
So you're doing it...

42:42.860 --> 42:45.021
I was far away in no time
with the Lada.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.690
You saved their lives.

43:30.341 --> 43:34.971
You still eat junk and won't let me
fix you something to take with you.

43:35.613 --> 43:40.414
A Mr. Padilla called. I told him you
weren't in. He'll get a hold of you.

43:41.118 --> 43:43.916
- Padilla?
- He's very nice...

43:44.622 --> 43:48.422
...we talked.
He's a co-worker, right?

43:51.161 --> 43:53.186
...commercializing cocaine.

43:53.297 --> 43:57.256
The cops seized a gun,
2 pounds of cocaine...

43:57.368 --> 43:59.893
...and 1, 1 40,000 pesos in cash.

44:00.304 --> 44:04.331
On being caught, the guys
shot the cops.

44:04.441 --> 44:06.875
Fortunately, nobody was wounded.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.507
But...

44:10.881 --> 44:14.942
...cab driver, have you ever
bet everything on something?

44:16.820 --> 44:21.018
Once I bet all my salary.
"Marilyn" was the mare's name...

44:21.659 --> 44:25.459
...a sure thing.
She was penultimate, the bitch.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.462
Penultimate!

44:30.167 --> 44:33.466
But all tips are a sure thing,
cab driver.

44:33.671 --> 44:37.300
Hey, you're very irresponsible.

44:37.408 --> 44:41.469
I was, that's why now
I hate horses so much.

44:41.679 --> 44:45.376
So, I'm away from races.
I'm away from races.

44:45.683 --> 44:50.643
Now I get why you brought us
here, you hate horses.

44:53.190 --> 44:57.320
I think, cabby, you were looking in
gambling for...

44:57.428 --> 44:58.986
...what you lacked in life.

44:59.697 --> 45:03.463
What I lacked in life?
This is what I lacked...

45:03.567 --> 45:05.660
...this. Money, money, money...

45:06.704 --> 45:11.164
...to get out of the hole and walk
straight through once and for all.

45:11.308 --> 45:15.404
Sure, now that you've got money
you're walking pretty straight.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.204
I'm walking nowhere now, man.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.180
And don't forget I'm a hostage.

45:23.220 --> 45:27.020
Speaking of which,
what's with Cotito?

45:27.124 --> 45:29.354
This kiddo's taking too long.

45:29.660 --> 45:33.357
Competitors in the 9th race
are getting close to boxes.

45:33.464 --> 45:38.026
Distance, 1,400 meters,
all of them run.

45:38.335 --> 45:41.361
A classic "Handicap
Bell Boy Award."

45:46.076 --> 45:49.534
Favorite one is "Coto"...

45:51.381 --> 45:52.848
...two pesos and eighty.

45:53.751 --> 45:54.718
Coto...

45:58.489 --> 45:59.547
Cool!

46:03.594 --> 46:05.721
It's time to do something.

46:06.764 --> 46:10.200
Try not to draw attention,
this is enemy territory.

46:25.582 --> 46:29.541
They're off! "Iria Marina" in first
place, 2nd goes "Malacatosa"...

46:29.653 --> 46:32.679
3rd, "First Lady", 4th, "How are
you", 5th, "Coto" on the outside.

46:32.890 --> 46:35.256
...6th, "Nerea",
7th, "Headache".

46:43.300 --> 46:44.665
What are you doing?

46:45.002 --> 46:48.403
- I bet on Coto! -What?
- Yes, there's a horse named Coto!

46:51.441 --> 46:53.773
We're here to work, asshole.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.505
If you don't come,
I'll do it alone.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.112
Fuck!

47:12.496 --> 47:15.465
- Coto goes first. And Coto wins!
- Go, go, go!

47:15.566 --> 47:17.033
Cool! Great!

47:17.134 --> 47:19.466
Assault! Assault!

47:35.853 --> 47:37.480
The start engine's out.

47:37.855 --> 47:41.450
- How much's to fix a fuckin' mess
like this? -Around 2 thousand!

47:41.558 --> 47:45.153
- How much could we have made?
- 5 million! Plus what my horse won!

47:46.196 --> 47:49.825
And this asshole decides to play
horses, damn!

47:49.933 --> 47:51.491
Stop it, stop it, man!

47:51.602 --> 47:52.830
C'mon, speed up!

47:53.871 --> 47:55.498
You stole nothing, man!

47:55.606 --> 47:58.507
We're the worst, man,
we're the worst!

48:05.883 --> 48:07.851
I couldn't go on, I had to see you.

48:14.992 --> 48:17.187
- Looks like the peach juice calms
me down. - Eat them all...

48:17.294 --> 48:22.197
...canned peaches are what I have
most. Nobody buys them anymore.

48:22.432 --> 48:24.366
I'll take the other one inside.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.887
You won't believe what happened.
We were in Providencia...

48:44.121 --> 48:45.554
What, what...?

48:47.925 --> 48:48.892
What is it?

48:50.928 --> 48:57.561
Distance makes passion
so fatal...

48:58.769 --> 49:03.832
...daybreak hurts me so much...

49:05.008 --> 49:09.570
...and the longing for you
makes my life bitter...

49:10.547 --> 49:12.242
...the longing for your body...

49:14.484 --> 49:15.815
You sing beautiful, uh?

49:18.288 --> 49:21.416
I can't suffer...

50:07.671 --> 50:09.298
- Good evening.
- Evening...

50:10.507 --> 50:12.600
- Long working day, uh?
- Yeah...

50:12.709 --> 50:15.769
...you gotta strech it to bring
something home. - Sure, and...

50:15.879 --> 50:19.781
...to pay advanced installments
also. - That's only when you can.

50:22.352 --> 50:26.812
Alright, get out of the car and
put your hands up, uh?

50:28.625 --> 50:31.116
Spread your legs a little bit.

50:32.529 --> 50:35.896
My partner Romero is better
at this than me.

50:35.999 --> 50:37.330
Good evening.

50:37.434 --> 50:40.631
You may notice, by the way my
friend moves his fingers, what...

50:40.737 --> 50:43.331
...we're looking for
has the shape of bills...

50:44.374 --> 50:47.002
...which seem to be part
of a plunder.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.637
Didn't you listen to the radio?

50:50.047 --> 50:51.742
No, it's out of order.

50:52.749 --> 50:54.740
Seven million, cash.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.538
- Is this to make up with yuor wife?
- Yes, it's...

51:15.639 --> 51:18.699
...our wedding anniversary.
- Have your radio fixed, it's...

51:18.809 --> 51:20.606
...good to be well informed.
Get in.

51:22.579 --> 51:25.207
- Start the engine!
- Are we ready?

51:26.416 --> 51:30.546
Start the engine, sometimes
start engines fail.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.578
Here's my phone number,
just in case.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.921
I'll see you soon.

53:05.849 --> 53:09.546
You had forgotten our anniversary
for the last five years.

53:10.854 --> 53:16.815
Two flowers per year, that makes it
10 flowers. You think I forgot...

53:16.927 --> 53:18.827
...the years I forgot?

53:19.529 --> 53:21.997
Speaking about forgetting...

53:24.701 --> 53:25.633
C'mon!

53:26.703 --> 53:29.501
- But, baby...
- Don't you get silly!

53:31.208 --> 53:36.840
What, what? Are you sleepy?
No, way. Yeah, come here.

53:48.058 --> 53:51.516
What... what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

53:51.628 --> 53:52.424
Hi.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.865
- Hi, pal.
- What're you doing here?

53:56.733 --> 53:58.530
Is there anything to eat?

53:58.969 --> 54:03.269
- Roast beef. - They spoke about the
assault on the radio. 7 million.

54:03.573 --> 54:07.134
Seven? No way!
And where are they?

54:07.544 --> 54:09.102
I don't know, maybe...

54:09.546 --> 54:15.542
Maybe I stole them, right?
Cab driver, everyone lies...

54:15.919 --> 54:18.149
...everyone lies, everyone lies,
everyone.

54:19.522 --> 54:24.482
Coto and I want lodging
for some days.

54:24.594 --> 54:27.495
- Lodging? -Things are a little tough
down there.

54:27.597 --> 54:31.556
- Zero tolerance, man.
- Lodge you here? I can't do that!

54:31.668 --> 54:35.968
We have nowhere to go, can't you
see? Just a few days, c'mon.

54:36.072 --> 54:40.236
After that, to each his own, uh?
You still got installments...

54:40.343 --> 54:44.541
...to pay, don't you? And we still
need a little more to show you...

54:44.648 --> 54:46.741
...we're not lousy muggers.

55:01.798 --> 55:03.527
Yeah? Alright?

55:03.967 --> 55:06.401
- Alright, you can spend the
night here. - Okay.

55:06.569 --> 55:08.093
- Come in, Cotito.
- Thanks.

55:09.306 --> 55:11.001
Alright, alright.

55:11.141 --> 55:16.272
Thanks, dude. Excuse us for
bothering you, but if we...

55:16.379 --> 55:18.779
...don't help each other...

55:19.816 --> 55:21.750
Good night, good night.

55:22.052 --> 55:25.283
Listen, that Lada will be yours,
that Lada will be yours.

55:25.388 --> 55:27.948
- Alright. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Yes, dude.

55:28.058 --> 55:29.753
Don't worry, sleep well.

55:29.859 --> 55:30.621
I'll close it.

56:15.372 --> 56:16.669
Hey, Daddy!

56:19.376 --> 56:22.607
You're so rude, you didn't introduce
me to your friends.

56:23.380 --> 56:27.680
I fixed the back room for them,
so they're more independant.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.358
You've been stealing with them?

56:39.796 --> 56:42.697
- They forced me to.
- They forced you?

56:42.832 --> 56:45.699
Well, first they assaulted me
and then they forced me.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.963
We can say they're
blackmailing me...

56:49.072 --> 56:52.166
...that they'd kill me, that
they'd hurt the kids.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.276
Check this out. It was my idea.

56:56.379 --> 57:00.315
I made Chavelo write that,
to cover my back.

57:03.753 --> 57:06.221
And why all this, for God's sake?

57:06.423 --> 57:09.984
To come out of the hole we were in,
to pay the car's installments.

57:10.093 --> 57:14.257
Times are hard, Nelly,
you konw that.

57:15.365 --> 57:20.325
Don't tell me you paid installments
in advance. They may catch you.

57:20.770 --> 57:23.295
No way, c'mon.

57:24.941 --> 57:27.205
You get the money for the
Lada and that's it?

57:28.344 --> 57:29.208
Yes.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.081
Bring bread.

58:06.483 --> 58:09.111
- Hey, Nelly, what's this color...?
- Hello, daddy!

58:09.219 --> 58:11.050
- Hey, daddy!
- Hey, daddy!

58:11.154 --> 58:14.453
I like the color.
Chavelo brought the painting.

58:14.557 --> 58:18.118
- Someone owed me some paint.
- It's so nice.

58:18.228 --> 58:21.561
- This is horrible. - He fixed the
dining table, Amaro's lamp...

58:21.664 --> 58:24.656
...I put Coto in the back room...

58:24.767 --> 58:27.736
...he ate well, now I'll give him
some of Ronny's clothes.

58:27.837 --> 58:30.931
I told the kids they're friends of
yours from the south.

58:42.519 --> 58:46.819
I'm glad you came. You know what?
I was so lonely...

58:46.923 --> 58:51.986
...I missed you. Listen,
you'll stay a while, right?

58:53.463 --> 58:56.159
- Stop, stop, stop!
- C'mon, a little more!

59:01.271 --> 59:05.833
Hey, daddy! Your kid's a genious,
he gets them all!

59:06.142 --> 59:09.168
Check out the computer Chavelo
brought. It's a Pentium with...

59:09.279 --> 59:12.840
...50 games included. - A Pentium.
- Chinese to me! This kiddo...!

59:13.049 --> 59:16.507
Chavelo, Chavelo, I got it, I got it,
I got it! I won, I won!

59:21.057 --> 59:22.422
Is it a Pentium also?

59:22.525 --> 59:25.517
I don't care what it is,
as long as it sews.

59:26.429 --> 59:28.522
- What else did he bring?
- He brought...

59:28.898 --> 59:34.530
...a vacum cleaner, a blender, a
computer, a small TV set, ...

59:34.637 --> 59:38.596
...this big one,
a fan.

59:39.142 --> 59:42.373
He left and came back by cab.
Ronny went with him.

59:42.845 --> 59:46.542
- Do you realize all this stuff...?
- I notice everything.

59:46.916 --> 59:49.350
They'll leave once you get
what you need.

59:50.920 --> 59:54.014
Meanwhile, I'll sew everything
I accumulated...

59:54.157 --> 59:57.558
...for so long...
...without a Pentium.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.234
It would be my first book.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.903
Dad says knowledge is painless.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.308
Good night.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.916
Good night.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.594
"Knowledge is painless."
How do I tell her I can't read?

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.264
Try with your mouth.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:40.967
I know all numbers: ninety six,
ninety seven...

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.035
I think it's time to sleep.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.473
Let's sleep.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:55.446
Good night... father.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:12.627
C'mon, Cotito, turn the light off.
You'll get eyecups.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:23.706
...from Massachusetts University
speaks of the composition of...

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:28.307
...the stone, the same that
appeared in the pocket of...

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.909
...Fulgencio Soto,
on May 5, 1985, after...

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:33.817
...having this strange
encounter with aliens.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.392
Watch, watch the eyes!

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.439
- Damn! What is it?
- I don't know. - What's going on?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.254
If you move, I'll kill you.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:16.459
Since she couldn't, you'll tell us
where your friends are...

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.534
...and where they
keep the money.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:31.710
You got one week.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.379
You have my number...

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.109
...you piss boy.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:55.928
"P" and "o" is "po",
and "p" and "u" is "pu".

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.732
- "Pzu".
- "Pu"

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.067
"Pzu".

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.478
Oh, I forgot! Your friend Padilla
called again. I told him...

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:17.082
...you weren't in, he'll call you
later tonight. - Alright.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.589
Are you talking about
Padilla, the cop?

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.164
No, not at all...

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.595
- A friend of yours?
- It's not what you think.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:30.771
You can't imagine what I'm thinking.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.602
I have a bad feeling about all this.

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:39.771
If I wanted to rat you out,
I would have a long time ago.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:45.780
Padilla... All Padilla wants is the
money and us dead.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:49.050
- Did he tell you that?
- No, he didn't say a word.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.387
If someone's fucked up, it's the
three of us and your family too.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.930
They won't believe the note.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.625
Coto! Coto!

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.471
You threw them out
before having paid the Lada.

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.322
- Aren't the kids having dinner?
- They're not hungry.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:26.222
Coto was coughing pretty bad.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:51.903
Nelly, you don't know how
we missed you.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.911
You don't know what you have here.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.918
You have...

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.354
...a home...

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:09.424
...a warm home, warm food,
bottled wine...

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.269
...a family, kids.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.332
It's hard out there.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:25.612
That made us find the Lord,
our Lord Jes...

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:30.442
Walking hand in hand with the
devil for so long, is no good.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.144
Lord? What Lord?

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:38.692
Our Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ
who came inside us...

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:43.625
...he who is up there watching us.
He'll come to judge us...

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.963
...the day of the Last Judgement.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:49.964
Chavelo met a friend who is
an Evangelic now...

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.975
...and he decided we want
to be like him.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:07:02.974
So tell your friend Padilla
we're not... we're not...

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.649
...we're not into that anymore.
Yo know.

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.894
We'll burst after this.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.683
- I want, I want, I want...
- Nelly!

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:38.754
...to heal your wounds.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:44.322
I want to heal your wounds
and pain...

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:50.423
I want, I want you to have a life.

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.558
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.698
I want to take sin
out of mankind.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.933
Glory to the Lord! Glory to the Lord!

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:04.372
I want, I want,
I want to heal your wounds.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.710
I want to heal your wounds,
my Lord!

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:11.048
I want to take sin
out of mankind.

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:17.051
I want, I want, I want
to heal your wounds.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:18.716
Glory to the Lord!

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:23.724
I want to heal your wounds
and pain.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:26.390
Alleluia, brother!

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:35.136
What is it with you?
They're good people.

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:36.904
Where did they come from?

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:41.015
He's "Cold Bullet", an old friend
of Chavelo who moved to the...

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.913
...right path and plays the
mandolin beautifully.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:47.785
- I hate Evangelics.
- How can you? You don't even...

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:52.917
...know them. They only preach about
love, they don't drink nor steal.

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:56.657
You mean preaching love for you.
I saw that lowlife...

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.529
...holding you and you laughing
and singing...

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.500
...those silly songs.

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:06.430
That bastard, overnight he turns
into a saint, leaving me here...

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.638
...paying the Lada's installments.
Nice going!

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.779
Bye, I'm going out. Someone
has to bring money home.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:04.825
He withdrew the shop's licence,
that son of a bitch.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:10.828
He wants me to turn you in if you don't
give your friends and the money in.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.844
He thinks it's around 10 million.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:22.514
But I didn't betray you,
and I feel proud of that.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:27.988
You know why?

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:31.526
Why?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:48.138
Careful, daddy, careful, it stains.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.550
It would be the last one.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:03.054
I would have most of the car's
installments paid.

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:08.891
It looks like you don't get the
Lord's word at all.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.694
Look, I've caused a lot of harm...

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.735
...but it's time for me
to repent, dude.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.132
You'll have time to repent.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:21.235
This would be the last one.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.241
Look at Cotito.
See how he's changed.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.907
He sees you as a father.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:31.316
Thanks to whom? To our
Lord's word and...

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.754
...to have been so lucky to have
met your family, You see?

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.918
The Lada's dealer.
A piece of cake...

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.592
...we go in and out, that's it.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.236
Not everything mine is yours,
you illiterate!

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.837
Calm down or you
won't be able to think.

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:08.246
To love your neighbor is one thing,
buy lust for my daughter is another.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:11.012
And you... not a peep.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.751
How can she kiss him with
his disgusting teeth?

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.827
He brushes them 3 times a day.
They're cleaner now.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.691
- Anyway, you're overreacting.
- Overreacting?

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.890
You fill my house with
Evangelics, my daughter...

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.934
...sleeps with an illiterate punk and
I'm overreacting!

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:30.027
- Cut it out, you know that's not
true. - Bastards.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.704
How can they betray me like this?

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.313
Shall we go?

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.048
- What is it?
- Nothing.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.047
- Nothing?
- Nothing

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.391
Cotito, for whom are we doing this?

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.391
For "Daddy", so he won't be
begging around anymore.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.484
C'mon, let's go.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.787
Let's get outta here!
He's scared to death!

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:58.860
- He should've shot the damned
chick! -Chick?

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:02.727
I told you there was an alarm
on the floor!

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.196
Never said it was
so quick!

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.797
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:45.397
No way, my Dad can't be a mugger!

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.196
Listen, man...

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:22.040
...it was my fault, that's why
I wanna make up.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.542
You asked me for a last favor...

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:27.706
...to get out of this shit...

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.648
...and I owe you.

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.378
You owe me nothing.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.218
Forget it.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:40.895
The guard...

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.229
...died.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.065
- They said it on TV.
- He died?

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:50.537
Look...

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:56.905
...all I ask you is to leave. Go.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:02.246
I know Padilla will never imagine...

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.909
...you guys are here...

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:10.486
...but one never knows, so you...
- Dude... ...better leave, go.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:16.252
...I made a promise to you and
I'll keep it.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:25.167
You'll pay that car, that's the least
Coto and I can do.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:32.611
So you think of something, you
tell me and that would be it.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.416
But quick 'cause I'm enjoying
being alive...

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.613
...and that's dangerous. You know.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.923
A private clinic.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.302
I've been setting eyes
on it for a long time.

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:04.105
One, two, three, we go in.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:07.142
That way, one, two, three.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:12.312
A lepper approached Jesus
while he was meditating.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.925
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.657
And here we go again:
one, two, three.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:29.000
A lepper approached Jesus
while he was meditating.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:30.401
Here's the lyrics.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:02.094
Come in, kiddo. We'll keep these
things in the back room and then...

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:06.258
...we'll use the car to bring some
other things.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:22.784
Hello?

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.689
Police? Armed robbery,
tomorrow night.

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:34.458
Los Cisnes Clinic in
Las Condes. Hello?

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:52.640
Remember the first time we
worked together? How you...

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.647
...pissed in your pants?

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.716
A long time ago.

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.552
Yes.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.816
Now you're a real thug.

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:07.483
Alright, get in there,
get in there.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.655
- Where?
- The gas station.

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.496
- What... what...?
- The gas station.

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:16.037
I have the feeling that clinics
keep the money...

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:20.574
...somewhere else.
You just get in there, c'mon.

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:25.874
- But, hell, how... The clinic is a
much easier job... - Son...

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:29.508
...and much more money! -Son,
Coto and I make things fast...

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:33.179
...you keep the engine running.
Gas stations are my specialty.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:36.519
- But how... - Okay.
- Let's go to the clinic.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:39.185
Trust me, I trust you.
We'll show you...

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:43.594
...we're no lowlives.
C'mon, get in, get in, get in.

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.193
Park there.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.204
- You ready?
- Yeah...

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.208
Alright, stop here.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:09.884
Listen. You know, I think it's not
nice to throw away what friends...

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:15.759
...give you. The Lord says: "What
is mine is yours". Bye, son.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:31.570
Hands up, you assholes!
Against the wall! C'mon!

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:40.037
Mum! Mum! Dad's on TV,
come and see! Hurry!

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:49.379
Turn it up, Amaro. Put on channel
13 in the other TV, Ronny.

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:52.453
I felt myself forced to act, and
decided to eliminate...

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:56.046
...this thugs once and for all.
They had threatened me...

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.398
We're broadcasting live. We are
with Ulises Morales who...

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:11.404
...has been the heroe in this
police day's journey...

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:15.408
...here in downtown Santiago,
in the corner of Vicuna...

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:18.741
...Mackenna and Departamental.
This cab driver has just...

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:22.442
...stopped an assault to a Copec
Gas Station. Tell us about...

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:26.350
...what you've just experienced.
What made you act like you did?

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:31.085
My survival instinct reacted
against this two delinquents...

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.760
...who had me under pressure...

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:38.421
...and forced me to be part of these
misdemeanors. I want...

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:43.766
...everyone to know I was a
hostage for weeks...

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:47.768
...they threatened me to kill my
family, my kids, myself...

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:50.606
...if I didn't do what they said.

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:54.273
Did you report this to the police?
Did anyone know about this?

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.943
No, I was afraid someone
from my family or I...

01:25:58.052 --> 01:26:01.453
...would get hurt.
- They threatened your family?

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:05.117
- Yes, they threatened us, all the
time. - You must have gone...

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:07.251
...through real hard times, right?

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.456
- Yeah.
- Well, ehhh...

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:14.297
I want to say I was a victim, a
hostage. These men forced me.

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:19.806
Well, this man's words speak
for themselves, right?
