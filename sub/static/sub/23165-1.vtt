WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.970
M.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.906
Most abominable,
And your hair.

00:07.941 --> 00:11.777
I do not wish my nurses
To dress in that manner.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.246
These boys must be looking
To their recuperation,

00:14.280 --> 00:16.114
Not the hem of your skirts.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.816
You come highly recommended,

00:17.851 --> 00:20.686
But I had no idea
You wore such a dress.

00:26.659 --> 00:29.294
Miss phinney.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.766
You are in mourning.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.101
My husband died
A year ago.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.070
Well,
The frock suits you.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.274
In a time of pain
And chaos,

00:42.308 --> 00:44.877
We are instruments
Of mercy and order.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.880
That and only that
Is what we offer the boys.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.348
Miss gibson!

00:51.084 --> 00:52.785
Quite clear, miss dix.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.953
I see here you looked

00:54.988 --> 00:56.822
After the good baron
During his illness

00:56.856 --> 00:58.557
And two young family members
In boston.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.325
At a difficult time
In my life,

01:00.360 --> 01:02.261
Nursing gave me
Renewed purpose.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.030
Now with the war and the
Terrible plague of slavery --

01:05.065 --> 01:09.201
Slavery, dear girl, is a matter
More of prayer than protest.

01:09.235 --> 01:13.072
Men fight
And women pray.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.941
It is not for us
To opine on politics.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.246
Pardon me, miss dix,
But...

01:21.281 --> 01:24.116
Slavery is not
A political question.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.118
<i>it is a moral argument.</i>

01:26.152 --> 01:28.387
And we are obliged,
Each of us, to --

01:28.421 --> 01:30.656
To what,
Dear child?

01:30.690 --> 01:34.159
I only mean to say,
Emancipation is upon us.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.627
The slaves will be free.

01:35.662 --> 01:38.363
Those not fighting to bring
That about only slow it down,

01:38.398 --> 01:41.400
And the more misery
Will come of it.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.238
Wonderful,
Miss phinney.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.407
Wonderful.

01:48.441 --> 01:52.111
Another
Noisy abolitionist.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.280
I have just the place
For you.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.817
The mansion house hospital
In alexandria.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.853
Lovely town,
Just across the river.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.089
The army moved in
A few months ago.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.225
So it is a union town,
Then.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.960
More or less.

02:07.994 --> 02:11.663
With a growing population
Of contraband slaves.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.900
Move!

02:14.934 --> 02:17.069
Well, i'm sure
I can be of use there,

02:17.103 --> 02:18.137
Among
Like-minded people.

02:18.171 --> 02:21.140
Who is the nurse in charge?
I'll report to her as --

02:21.174 --> 02:23.008
You shall be the first.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.610
The first?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.246
The first dix nurse,
Yes.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.249
You are my emissary, no matter
What anyone tells you.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.417
Do I take it
That I will...

02:32.452 --> 02:34.286
Will I not
Be welcome there?

02:34.320 --> 02:38.223
Army doctors
Do not like women

02:38.258 --> 02:41.393
Or nurses or me.

02:41.427 --> 02:45.264
But you are dignified
And well-spoken,

02:45.298 --> 02:48.267
Firm but inoffensive,

02:48.301 --> 02:50.702
Sufficiently plain
So as not to distract.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.205
You'll do splendidly.

02:53.239 --> 02:57.709
And if you are not welcome,
Then I am not welcome,

02:57.744 --> 03:00.946
And I do not like
To be unwelcome.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.017
Now, come!

03:05.051 --> 03:07.553
Let's make arrangements
For your travel.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.994
 mansion house hospital,
Ma'am.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.637 --> 03:28.740
Peg legs! Glass eyeballs!

03:28.775 --> 03:30.042
A ribbon
For your honey!

03:34.914 --> 03:36.648
Man:
Bullet went right through.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.452
Please.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.825
Glass eyeballs!

03:46.859 --> 03:48.360
What's your name, reb?

03:48.394 --> 03:49.695
Fairfax.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.364
T-tom fairfax,
17th virginia infantry.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.032
Come on, now.
Here we go.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.500
All right, easy now.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.904
This is
A union hospital, yes?

03:58.938 --> 04:02.908
And this man is a confederate?
Orders are, we take in
Whoever ends up here.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.688
Mercy street was mad

05:19.619 --> 05:21.453
Transition

05:21.487 --> 05:23.121
Nurse? Nurse!

05:23.156 --> 05:24.990
Nurse, over here!

05:25.024 --> 05:26.591
My -- my leg!

05:26.626 --> 05:29.928
Nurse, excuse me.
I need your help.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.631
I-i can't
Feel my toes.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.967
Nurse. Nurse, come o--
Come over here.

05:38.538 --> 05:41.006
Henry: look on him
With eyes of mercy,

05:41.040 --> 05:43.709
Give him patience
Under his affliction,

05:43.743 --> 05:46.712
And, in thy good time,
Restore him to health.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.514
And enable him to lead
The residue of his life...

05:50.683 --> 05:53.819
...To thy fear
And to thy glory.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.520
Otis: let me go!

05:55.555 --> 05:58.657
I took a vow to keep it flying,
And I damn well will!

06:04.130 --> 06:05.664
Please.
Please help me.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.000
You're from miss dix?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.370
You need to see
Dr. Summers.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.672
Are you the matron?
I'm miss phinney.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.707
I know who you are.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.876
Well...

06:17.910 --> 06:19.711
This must have been
Quite a hotel.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.814
Certainly,
For the secesh upper crust.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.183
Family that owned it,
The greens,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.386
They love it so much,
They refuse to leave.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.690
Blasted rebels
Live right down the street.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.393
Please, be careful.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.395
That is true
Indian ivory,

06:36.429 --> 06:40.065
Brought back by my husband's
Grandfather, the admiral.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.601
Listen, you must store it
Very, very safely.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.436
How shall we reclaim it?

06:44.470 --> 06:47.005
Hyah!
Please be careful
With that, please!

06:47.039 --> 06:48.707
Mcclellan's got them
Turning tail.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.041
We'll have richmond
Before long.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.042
No doubt about it.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.478
We got more boys headed
Down there all the time.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.106
Morning, papa.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.474
Mama.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.042
They broke
The indian chest!

07:24.076 --> 07:26.912
One of the elephant heads
Fell off in the yard.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.814
I found a tusk
In the hallway.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.048
I'm sorry, mother.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.416
Don't ask for an apple.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.685
Yankees took
The last of them.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.087
All right.
Then i'll get an egg.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.357
Soldiers ate them all up
Yesterday.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.525
Foul intruders.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.894
My father would have taken
A paddle to every last one.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.896
Fortunately,
Your father's not here.

07:44.931 --> 07:48.900
That chest was an heirloom,
James, from your family.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.303
<i>exactly.
You don't see me fretting.</i>

07:51.337 --> 07:54.072
All we can do is make the best
Of the situation.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.574
That's not all.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.577
We could go.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.047
Leave our home?
Other families have.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.782
And other families
Have lost everything,

08:03.816 --> 08:07.352
Relying upon the generosity
Of other people in other places.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.658
Not us.
Alexandria is our home.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.462
Have you tried the jam?
Yes. Quite good.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.569
When this is over,
Three or four months from now,

08:24.604 --> 08:26.805
Our life will resume
Much as it was.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.773
Until then,
We share our house with them.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.942
Not only our house!

08:30.977 --> 08:33.611
Our streets, our food,
Our milk,

08:33.645 --> 08:36.114
And our hotel is turned
Into their charnel house.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.416
Emma.
I will not have you
Talk that way.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.921
I'm sorry.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.023
But the confederacy
Will make it right.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.358
Soldiers like frank.

08:46.392 --> 08:47.993
And tom.
They're fighting for us.

08:48.027 --> 08:52.397
Oh, yes, if only we green men
Were as brave as your two beaus.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.367
<i>well, at least they're willing
To stand up for something.</i>

08:55.401 --> 08:57.669
Or die for nothing.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.738
How do you think it looks

08:59.772 --> 09:01.940
<i>to have a brother and father
Doing business here</i>

09:01.974 --> 09:05.210
While all the other men have
Either gone to fight or fled?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.546
All right, now.
Leave jimmy alone.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.715
Let's all breathe
And have some...

09:10.750 --> 09:13.318
...Stewed rhubarb.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.887
Rhubarb?
For breakfast?

09:15.922 --> 09:17.889
Beggars and choosers,
Dear.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.892
Beggars and choosers.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.061
Dr. Summers,
I was sent by miss dix.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.596
I'm aware,
Miss phinney,

09:24.630 --> 09:26.865
Or should I say
Baroness von olnhausen?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.567
"miss phinney" will do,
Thank you.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.702
I aim to be
Of service here.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.970
Oh, yes, yes.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.839
A fancy teutonic widow
Should come in handy.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.709
<i>the men are always clamoring
For spanferkel.</i>

09:37.743 --> 09:39.444
My husband, the baron,
Was german.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.447
I myself am a born-and-bred
New englander.

09:42.481 --> 09:43.682
<i>so, no spanferkel,
Then?</i>

09:43.716 --> 09:45.850
I believe you'll find
I have more to contribute

09:45.885 --> 09:47.485
Than suckling pig.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.588
You underestimate
Suckling pig.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.456
I have experience
As a nurse.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.124
I've looked after
Several invalid relatives,

09:53.159 --> 09:54.492
Including my husband.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.995
What, the dead duke?

09:57.029 --> 10:00.532
Well, that didn't turn out
So well, did it?

10:00.566 --> 10:01.700
Oh.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.569
Eh,
Gangrene has set in.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.538
The smell
Is the least of it.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.907
Kendrick, change this.
Kendrick: yes, sir.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.375
Contribute, will you?

10:10.409 --> 10:13.078
As soon as I find you
A room with a bed

10:13.112 --> 10:15.246
And a looking glass --
Of which we're in

10:15.281 --> 10:17.048
Very short supply,
By the way --

10:17.083 --> 10:19.718
And someone to fetch meals
And get little things for you?

10:19.752 --> 10:23.421
Perhaps a pretty young houseboy
To rub your feet at night?

10:23.456 --> 10:26.891
I require only minimal comforts.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.893
Oh, my eye!

10:28.928 --> 10:31.529
My eye!

10:31.564 --> 10:34.733
You've no idea what you're
Signing up for here, do you?

10:35.935 --> 10:37.502
Go back to boston.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.171
I will not.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.607
Miss dix dispatched me
With precise instructions.

10:42.642 --> 10:47.112
You tell dragon dix
That i'll choose my own staff,

10:47.146 --> 10:48.813
Nurses included.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.449
If I need her help,
I'll ask for it.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.119
Uh, you're needed
In the ballroom, sir.

10:57.523 --> 10:59.324
Matron...

10:59.358 --> 11:03.328
See what accommodations
Can be arranged for the duchess.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.034
The nurses' rooms
Be on the top floor.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.568
You may
Have to share one.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.437
All I need
Is a bed somewhere.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.773
<i>haven't had a...
Head nurse before.</i>

11:14.807 --> 11:16.641
It should help,
Don't you think?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.710
I guess miss dix
Thinks it does.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.680
It may be prudent for me
To proceed at a deliberate pace.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.715
For now, i'll take some time
To acclimate,

11:23.749 --> 11:25.216
Study,
Learn how things work.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.752
Come.
Here's the surgical room.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.154
Just that leg.

11:31.123 --> 11:35.093
Pass the saw, please?
In there deep.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.327
Yes.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.864
Ah, you must be
The new nurse.

11:39.899 --> 11:44.035
I am dr. Hale,
Chief operating surgeon.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.908
You do speak german,
Don't you?

12:01.287 --> 12:02.787
What I can't understand

12:02.822 --> 12:05.356
<i>is why we're bringing
In their wounded.</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:07.358
How many wounded
Would you say?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.693
Five or six.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.695
Butternuts? Here?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.564
Virginia boys.

12:12.598 --> 12:17.135
I say, leave them out there
For the buzzards.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.816
Brannan:
You look a bit faint, dear.

12:31.851 --> 12:35.353
In washington city, everything
Was much more...Civilized.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.057
I need help in here!

12:39.091 --> 12:40.792
Oh, lord blind me,
What's this ruckus?

12:40.826 --> 12:42.660
Dr. Foster: put it down!

12:43.529 --> 12:45.663
Nathan: off of me, you butcher!
Put it down.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.099
Ah, matron, will you explain
To this good man

12:48.134 --> 12:50.101
That chloroform
Will not kill him?

12:50.136 --> 12:53.071
Soldier,
Put that gun down now!

12:53.105 --> 12:55.707
I ain't putting nothing down.
I appreciate your
Practical approach, matron,

12:55.741 --> 12:58.710
But we've tried that tack
Already.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.447
I said stay back, now!

13:02.481 --> 13:03.782
Stay back!

13:03.816 --> 13:05.483
Put it down!

13:05.518 --> 13:07.018
Put it down, I say!

13:07.052 --> 13:10.388
Swear you ain't gonna
Be tossing my arm out
The window in an hour?

13:10.422 --> 13:13.057
I have neither intention nor
Desire to amputate your arm.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.460
Tell me the truth, god damn it!
The wound's infected.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.796
The ball
Needs to come out.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.832
But god as my witness,
I'll do everything in my power

13:20.866 --> 13:22.734
To keep you
And your arm attached.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.469
I want out
Of this death house!

13:24.503 --> 13:27.372
Provisions and a horse,
Now!

13:40.853 --> 13:44.622
Now, I don't mean to hurt you,
Miss, but I will, if needs be.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.024
Soldier, this is a place

13:46.058 --> 13:48.193
Of peace and healing,
Not a place for guns.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.160
That's a damn lie!

13:49.195 --> 13:51.229
It's a place of war!

13:53.966 --> 13:56.301
Help him!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.069
Settle down!
Stop your struggling.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.804
You termagant!
You coward!

14:03.542 --> 14:06.010
Somebody tend to that one,
Quickly.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.513
My arm.
Matron, escort that lady out.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.683
Any more of her christian care
May just get one of us killed.

14:13.085 --> 14:14.986
Impressive
For a civilian.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.189
Husband or son?
Who are you here to visit?

14:18.224 --> 14:20.191
No one.
I was sent by miss dix.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.726
No!
You're the duchess?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.462
Yes. I mean no.
Baroness.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.965
<i>did you
Bring spanferkel?</i>

14:26.999 --> 14:28.833
All right, then.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.969
Start by scrubbing
That bunch over there.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.937
They're quite fetid.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.739
Haven't you got a room?

14:34.773 --> 14:36.074
No, not yet.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.543
Leave your bags there,
Against the wall.

14:49.255 --> 14:54.058
Oh, military hospitals
And crinoline don't mix, dearie.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.560
Do your parents know
You're here?

14:55.594 --> 14:57.629
I've come to lend comfort
To the soldiers.

14:57.663 --> 15:01.566
Is that so?
What sort of comfort?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.736
Sympathy?
And a friendly face?

15:04.770 --> 15:06.537
Well, that's just fine,
Dearie,

15:06.572 --> 15:09.507
But our union boys are entitled
To proper nursing care.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.443
No.
Not the yankees.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.445
The confederates.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.647
I understand
You have some.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.684
Why, yes, we do, and you're
Just the thing they need.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.025
There.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.360
We have uncovered
Your natural hue.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.497
May your bed above be easy for
The day's work you are doing.

15:32.531 --> 15:35.867
Now,
Off with these boots.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.802
Hold now!
There you are.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.471
It's hard telling which is
Dirtiest, the foot or the shoe.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.540
Oh, i'm so sorry.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.942
Lesson one --

15:43.976 --> 15:46.377
Ascertain whether or not
The patient is wearing boots

15:46.412 --> 15:47.879
Before attempting
To remove them.

15:49.848 --> 15:53.351
 amputation
Through the infected tissue

15:53.385 --> 15:54.519
Risks causing pyemia.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.287
This is the army,
Foster.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.823
We have a procedure to follow,
Efficiency to maintain.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.825
Yeah,
And I have an oath to uphold.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.994
You have one of those,
Too, don't you?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.630
You may be regarded as some
Fancy head doctor in baltimore.

16:05.664 --> 16:09.467
But here, you are nothing more
Than a civilian contract surgeon

16:09.501 --> 16:11.836
Under my authority.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.906
Step cautiously.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.880
I must fetch
Some clean water.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.083
I promised him!
I understand that, son.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.785
I promised him!
I promised my father!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.854
Is everything all right?

16:29.888 --> 16:32.290
I told my father
I wouldn't let this flag drop

16:32.324 --> 16:34.325
As long as I could take
A breath.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.195
Your father, is he here?
He died in battle.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.964
How old are you?
18, ma'am, not a day under.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.432
That's a minimum age
To serve.

16:41.467 --> 16:45.103
I am. I was born
April 12, 184...

16:46.538 --> 16:47.238
...3.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.374
Allow me to take
That flag?

16:49.408 --> 16:51.142
I'll make sure
It's well cared for.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.077
No, ma'am, I can't.
I can't! I can't!

16:53.112 --> 16:54.912
Aah! Aah!
Bugler: he truly can't, miss.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.815
The damn thing is glued
To his hand from the blood.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.853
Very well.
Keep it for now.

17:01.887 --> 17:02.987
I'm nurse von olnhausen.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.991
Nurse von ol...Hau...

17:07.026 --> 17:09.493
Call me nurse mary.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.462
I'm henry hopkins.
I'm the chaplain here.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.432
God be with you,
Nurse mary.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.136
Son?

17:18.170 --> 17:21.204
When did you
Take up the flag?

17:25.611 --> 17:27.578
Delivery
For mansion house.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.981
Food and kitchen items
Get hauled to the basement,

17:30.015 --> 17:31.149
You mangy dogs.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.385
I got you something.

17:36.922 --> 17:40.925
Oh, it's awful pretty.
A bird.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.528
Yeah. For when
You want to fly away.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.598
Back to work, lazy cow.

17:50.035 --> 17:53.504
Move on now, boy.
You got plenty to do.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.373
Don't I know it,
Mr. Bullen?

17:55.407 --> 17:58.276
All sorts of things
For me to do.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.914
You think you're safe
'cause you work for summers?

18:02.948 --> 18:04.082
You ain't safe.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.983
I'll have them dogs
On you

18:06.018 --> 18:08.219
Quicker than a runaway
In a cotton field.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.336
Not much of a view,
Is it?

18:25.370 --> 18:27.872
Come, I would like to offer you
An advantage

18:27.906 --> 18:29.540
To observe
The best at work,

18:29.575 --> 18:31.909
Miss anne hastings
On her ward.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.411
Oh.
I've heard of her.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.581
She trained under
Florence nightingale, you know.

18:36.615 --> 18:42.587
"lo, in that house of misery,
The lady with a lamp, I see

18:42.621 --> 18:44.956
Pass through
The glimmering gloom

18:44.990 --> 18:49.627
And flit
From room to room."

18:49.661 --> 18:53.164
That's emerson,
You know.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.366
Longfellow, I believe.

18:57.236 --> 19:01.839
Well, they have their
Lady with a lamp in the crimea,

19:01.874 --> 19:04.842
And we have anne hastings
In alexandria.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.844
She is god's gift
To the boys.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.847
And I might add,
To us doctors, as well.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.249
I got the impression

19:11.283 --> 19:14.118
Dr. Summers disapproves
Of lady volunteers.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.822
For miss hastings,
He makes an exception.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.525
We all do. Come.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.834
Are you from
The virginia cavalry?

19:29.868 --> 19:31.035
Yes, ma'am.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.503
I'm looking for
A frank stringfellow.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.672
He would have been fighting
Alongside you, I think.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.107
I don't...

19:38.610 --> 19:39.911
Pardon me?

19:41.246 --> 19:43.881
Tom?!

19:43.916 --> 19:46.217
Tom fairfax?

19:46.251 --> 19:49.287
I can't breathe.
There's -- there's no air.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.524
Here, have some water.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.339
Alice, is that you?

20:08.373 --> 20:11.175
No, tom.
It's emma, alice's sister.

20:11.210 --> 20:16.047
Sorry. My head is...
Is not so clear.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.382
I'm looking for frank.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.451
Was he with you?
Frank stringfellow?

20:20.485 --> 20:23.621
I don't remember.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.623
George was with me.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.593
George henderson.
I lost him in the smoke.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.597
It's all right, tom.

20:32.631 --> 20:36.133
Let me sit with you a while,
Settle your nerves.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.969
Everything
Will be better soon.

20:38.003 --> 20:43.741
We can tell all the old stories
From when we were children.

20:43.775 --> 20:46.377
This is the english method

20:46.411 --> 20:49.080
Which miss nightingale and i
Implemented

20:49.114 --> 20:51.048
To great success
In the crimea.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.185
It is sometimes referred to
As plaster of paris --

20:54.219 --> 20:57.188
A misnomer I attribute
To the distasteful french habit

20:57.222 --> 20:59.590
Of taking credit
For british innovation.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.294
Conditions
Must be pristine...

21:03.996 --> 21:08.499
...Old bandages redressed,
Soiled linens replaced,

21:08.533 --> 21:11.168
Nutritional needs
Attended to.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.903
And once we have fed the body,

21:12.938 --> 21:15.973
We must also feed
The mind of the man.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.943
To heal the sick is an art,
Not a science.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.079
Every patient
Is our sistine chapel.

21:22.114 --> 21:27.084
So, as the rascally french say,
Voilà.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.158
Tomorrow, I shall address
Dietary needs

21:34.192 --> 21:36.027
Of the grievously wounded.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.261
Uh, miss hastings?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.531
Uh, meet our new nurse,
Miss phinney.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.133
Poor thing
Was recently widowed --

21:42.167 --> 21:43.634
Yes, dr. Hale,
I'm aware.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.270
No need to be ashamed of your
Inexperience, miss phinney.

21:46.305 --> 21:50.107
Oh, i'm not, miss hastings.
While you were in boston
Keeping the good duke's house...

21:50.142 --> 21:52.943
Baron.
...I was in scutari,
Saving lives.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.279
Yes, i've read
Miss nightingale's book.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.014
She was most impressive.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.016
<i> our accomplishment
In the crimea</i>

21:59.051 --> 22:01.819
Is something
We're all proud of.

22:01.853 --> 22:05.022
Uh, miss phinney,
Uh, is quite promising --

22:05.057 --> 22:08.726
Florence, as I was given leave
To call her,

22:08.760 --> 22:13.064
Was the mother of this high and
Holy calling known as nursing.

22:13.098 --> 22:17.568
I will be happy to impart
What wisdom I can to you.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.404
I appreciate that.
Truly.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.273
So, you come
From miss dix?

22:22.307 --> 22:23.641
Yes, I do.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.377
And your position?
What is your position to be?

22:26.411 --> 22:29.547
I am...A nurse.

22:29.581 --> 22:31.082
Here to represent
Miss dix

22:31.116 --> 22:35.720
And, uh, coordinate...
The nursing at mansion house

22:35.754 --> 22:37.722
With her guidelines
And directives.

22:37.756 --> 22:40.224
You have no title,
Then?

22:40.258 --> 22:42.727
Heaven knows,
Miss dix loves hierarchy.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.964
I am to be
The head nurse.

22:47.733 --> 22:48.432
The head nurse?

22:48.467 --> 22:49.934
But I have much
To learn,

22:49.968 --> 22:52.603
So I am glad
I will have you to rely upon.

22:52.637 --> 22:57.641
Allow me to ask you a question
Florence put to the 38 of us

22:57.676 --> 22:59.877
When we first arrived
At the selimiye barracks

22:59.911 --> 23:03.981
And saw all those beds
Filled with dying boys.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.884
"ladies," she asked,
"are you afraid?"

23:06.918 --> 23:08.352
Are you asking
If i'm afraid?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.521
Of what you will face here
Within these walls

23:10.555 --> 23:12.523
Before this savage struggle
Is over?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.191
Not everyone
Was made for this.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.693
And one thing
I have learned

23:15.727 --> 23:17.862
Is how very little
Can be accomplished

23:17.896 --> 23:19.130
Under the spirit
Of fear.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.265
Do I seem afraid to you,
Miss hastings?

23:22.667 --> 23:26.170
<i>i think it was cicero who wrote,
"res ipsa loquitur."</i>

23:27.606 --> 23:31.709
The thing speaks
For itself.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.980
 i'm scared.

23:36.014 --> 23:39.283
Shh, tom.
I'm here now.

23:39.317 --> 23:42.186
When I go home, i'll tell alice
You're back, and she'll --

23:42.220 --> 23:44.989
She--
No! Please.

23:45.023 --> 23:45.890
You can't.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.792
Well, she has to know
You're all right.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.761
I won't have her see me
Like this.

23:50.796 --> 23:54.131
Please promise me.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.736
When you're ready,
Then.

24:06.244 --> 24:09.580
They say i'm lucky.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.416
The shots passed
Right through me, but still --

24:12.451 --> 24:14.585
You're alive.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.021
That's what matters.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.023
The dreams.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.293
Things in my head.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.828
Sometimes I know
They ain't real.

24:23.862 --> 24:27.565
But other times,
I-i lose track.

24:31.603 --> 24:36.073
I think he's right here,
Telling me which way to go.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.775
Who is?

24:43.081 --> 24:46.350
George henderson.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.122
Maybe there's something they can
Give you, tom, for your nerves.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.492
There's no medicine
For what ails me.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.396
They don't understand
What's in my head.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.501
I'll heal on my own.

25:07.973 --> 25:11.108
So, you met the queen
Of the crimea.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.209
She seems
Quite knowledgeable.

25:12.244 --> 25:16.747
Yes. And every lesson comes
With a kick in the teeth.

25:21.386 --> 25:24.555
There's a trampling victim
In the library.

25:24.589 --> 25:25.890
He hasn't been seen yet.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.958
Fast as I can.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.059
Are you all right?

25:29.094 --> 25:31.028
Yes.
Yes, i'm fine.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.132
Doctor,
Would you help me?

25:35.166 --> 25:37.334
The hoop-skirt assassin.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.303
I hear there's a posse
Out for you.

25:39.337 --> 25:40.304
I'll find someone else.

25:40.338 --> 25:44.308
Perhaps
That is better.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.377
Or perhaps not.

25:46.411 --> 25:49.213
There's a patient here
I was speaking with.

25:49.247 --> 25:50.581
A family member?
No.

25:50.615 --> 25:52.283
Then you don't
Belong here.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.618
This is
My family's hotel.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.487
<i> you are the one
Who doesn't belong.</i>

25:56.521 --> 25:58.355
Well,
What a gracious host.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.357
The boy is hurt,

26:00.392 --> 26:02.993
And he's been given to believe
There is no remedy.

26:03.028 --> 26:06.030
Perhaps his being a confederate
Has had some bearing?

26:06.064 --> 26:08.232
Who told him that?
On his case report.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.935
It says he was examined
By a dr. Hale.

26:14.706 --> 26:19.910
Shortness of breath,
Palpitations, sweating.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.212
Chest pain.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.747
And the mental
Distraction?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.616
Interesting.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.952
There is an army doctor
In philadelphia,

26:27.986 --> 26:29.954
Jacob mendes da costa.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.289
Been studying a malady
Common among soldiers.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.960
Cardiac palpitations
Precipitated by battle trauma.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.128
This boy's symptoms
Match up.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.564
Da costa refers to it
As soldier's heart.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.166
What can be done
For him?

26:53.311 --> 26:55.813
Isn't there a treatment
Less invasive?

26:55.847 --> 26:58.115
Morphine works best.
I mean the needle.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.250
Isn't there a pill?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.720
Not with
The same efficacy.

27:02.754 --> 27:05.656
I'm feeling better.
Really, I am.

27:05.690 --> 27:08.659
Dr. Foster?
Yes, yes, trampling victim,
Presently.

27:08.693 --> 27:11.161
He is a pennsylvania
Cavalryman.

27:11.196 --> 27:14.298
Miss phinney, do you take issue
With the way i'm doing my job?

27:14.332 --> 27:15.666
Now, answer carefully

27:15.700 --> 27:18.068
Because the next question
Will be, "do I care?"

27:18.103 --> 27:19.570
The doctor
Is helping tom now.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.972
Miss, this is not your business.
It is, indeed.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.208
You are not even
Meant to be here.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.510
Pardon me?
Please excuse us, miss.

27:26.544 --> 27:27.478
What is all this?

27:27.512 --> 27:29.179
This cavalryman,
Is he someone to you?

27:29.214 --> 27:31.181
No, not at all.
Then why the urgency?

27:31.216 --> 27:33.183
The boy got drunk,
Fell off his horse,

27:33.218 --> 27:35.786
And was kicked in the rump
On his way down.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.488
Is he late
To receive his medal?

27:37.522 --> 27:40.290
He can wait.
I'll be with him soon.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.164
Oh.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.933
Wood's syringe
Is an excellent device.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.238
Developed by alexander wood,
A scotsman,

27:54.272 --> 27:56.140
And a french orthopedic surgeon
Called pravaz.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.275
I was in europe
A few years back

27:58.309 --> 28:00.210
And saw pravaz demonstrate
On a spaniel.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.845
A dog?
Mm.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.949
Made a full recovery,
Barking happily ever after.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.826
Count to 10, tom.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.995
One...Two....

28:18.029 --> 28:20.497
Experimenting
With injecting morphine.
...Three...

28:20.532 --> 28:22.933
I started looking into it
When I was abroad.
...Four...

28:22.967 --> 28:25.803
It's faster
Than swallowing a pill,

28:25.837 --> 28:27.671
And it is perfectly safe.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.674
...Six...Seven...

28:33.178 --> 28:35.713
Tom?

28:37.182 --> 28:39.516
Very good.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.617
Fastest yet.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.553
I must make a note
Of that.

28:42.587 --> 28:44.722
Foster.
A moment, please.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.728
No need to thank me,
Hoop skirt.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.533
That reb
Was not your patient.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.635
<i>i think of them all
As our patients.</i>

28:58.670 --> 29:01.338
I did not authorize it.
It was not a surgical procedure.

29:01.372 --> 29:02.539
Your authorization
Was not required.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.843
You wasted a useful opiate
On a confederate malingerer.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.077
He was in pain.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.245
Pain is good.

29:08.279 --> 29:10.180
Pain is cathartic.
Not that kind of pain.

29:10.215 --> 29:13.183
He was suffering from extreme
Heart irregularity, anxiety.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.119
You cannot use
That hypodermic contraption

29:15.153 --> 29:18.188
As a delivery mechanism
For an unnecessary medication

29:18.223 --> 29:19.723
To a mythological
Condition

29:19.758 --> 29:21.625
Suffered by an enemy
To the union.

29:21.659 --> 29:24.294
Well, it does sound bad
When you put it like that.

29:24.863 --> 29:28.832
The man with the dislocated
Eye socket is ready for surgery.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.934
This will not
Be tolerated.

29:49.888 --> 29:53.190
I found these
In the lobby, miss.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.058
You might
Want to mind them.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.960
Yes, thank you.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.569
I'm obliged.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.104
Uh, we met outside?

30:07.138 --> 30:08.338
I'm samuel diggs.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.473
You're an orderly?

30:09.507 --> 30:11.041
They don't let us
Be orderlies.

30:11.075 --> 30:13.710
Dr. Summers brought me on
As a laborer.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.345
Were you owned
By a doctor?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.880
Never been owned, miss.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.049
I grew up
In a physician's household,

30:19.083 --> 30:21.051
Dr. Berenson
Of philadelphia.

30:21.085 --> 30:24.221
I watched him save
Many a patient.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.557
If you need anything,
You let me know.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.259
I'll be sure to,
Mr. Diggs.

30:36.534 --> 30:38.669
I've been to see
Your drunk cavalryman.

30:38.703 --> 30:41.972
All he needs is something
For his wounded pride.

30:43.241 --> 30:46.076
Contrabands, you know,
They can be very tricky.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.244
He's not a contraband.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.246
They steal. They lie.

30:49.280 --> 30:53.116
They feel because they are free,
They must answer to no one.

30:53.151 --> 30:56.019
Pardon me, but aren't we
Fighting to free men of color?

30:56.054 --> 30:58.121
Isn't that
What this war is about?

30:58.156 --> 30:59.590
No, it's about
Preserving the republic.

30:59.624 --> 31:03.393
Even lincoln says so.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.462
That boy
Needs the chaplain.

31:05.496 --> 31:06.763
Is there no hope?

31:06.798 --> 31:08.765
There's buckshot
All through his body,

31:08.800 --> 31:11.702
Too much for us
To even begin extracting.

31:11.736 --> 31:16.273
When medicine fails,
Give faith a try.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.112
Strange days.

31:22.146 --> 31:25.482
Even the first lady's brother
Was on our side.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.287
This was
Her half-brother.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.155
Her brother
Is a confederate surgeon.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.492
Not another doctor.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.027
At least
He died fighting.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.099
Jimmy, you're not
Able to soldier.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.467
My foot is no deterrent.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.903
The doctor said I could stop
Using the cane soon.

31:45.937 --> 31:46.870
I need you here.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.972
I won't have this family
Further depleted.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.340
We are depleted

31:50.375 --> 31:52.509
When our friends and neighbors
Think we are cowards.

31:52.543 --> 31:55.045
They don't think that.
Please.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.113
You heard the girls.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.581
Jane:
Are you two off somewhere?

31:57.615 --> 32:00.317
We have business
To attend to.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.857
Jimmy.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.859
Nothing to worry about,
Dear.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.746
Uh, sir?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.949
Uh, some water,
I-if you please?

32:31.983 --> 32:33.050
In a minute, grayback.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.032
Here.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.368
I'll hold the cup
For you.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.538
Yours is the first kind face
I seen.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.573
To them,
All we is is the enemy.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.608
Greater the pity
For them.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.747
How's your friend?

33:03.781 --> 33:06.950
Better. Thanks.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.785
Are you tending
To these men?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.187
Well, someone must.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.625
Marchioness?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.294
A moment.

33:17.328 --> 33:18.829
That man's wound
Ought to

33:18.863 --> 33:20.664
Have been redressed hours ago,
Shouldn't it?

33:20.698 --> 33:22.632
Yes, I suppose so,
But it's --

33:22.667 --> 33:24.935
There are men in there
Who are thirsty,

33:24.969 --> 33:27.237
Who are dirty,
Whose beds need to be remade.

33:27.271 --> 33:32.976
I demand you get to these men,
All of them, in a timely manner.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.017
And put these
Somewhere else.

33:52.063 --> 33:56.400
It must not be easy, having
To decide who to help when.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.872
That man whose thirst
You were quenching?

34:01.906 --> 34:05.509
I heard that a union boy
Surrendered to his platoon,

34:05.543 --> 34:06.910
Gave up his weapon.

34:06.944 --> 34:10.246
Once he was unarmed,
Your man shot him dead,

34:10.281 --> 34:13.583
Right where he stood,
Pleading for his life.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.585
To you, he's a victim.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.789
To me,
A cold-blooded killer.

34:21.025 --> 34:24.161
Whatever he was
Out there,

34:24.195 --> 34:27.230
In here,
He was merely thirsty.

34:28.699 --> 34:32.002
Are there no sinning yankees
In these beds?

34:32.036 --> 34:35.739
Atrocities are only ever
Committed by the enemy?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.511
I have work to do.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.420
May I ask you
How you came to nursing?

34:54.324 --> 34:55.625
My husband got sick.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.361
Is he in the army?

35:05.503 --> 35:06.837
I...

35:08.773 --> 35:11.475
I'm so sorry.

35:13.578 --> 35:18.248
With the war, I saw
An opportunity to be of use.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.584
I thought I knew
How it would be,

35:20.618 --> 35:25.589
Working alongside compatriots,
Tending the boys.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.627
Joining
Behind a cause.

35:34.465 --> 35:38.802
This is...
A bit different.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.940
I admire your aspirations
To be of use.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.276
I'm starting to feel
The same pull.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.812
If that is so, i...

35:50.281 --> 35:52.249
No, it's not my business.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.950
Oh, please!

35:53.985 --> 35:55.352
Advise me.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.590
You're young.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.859
Clearly intelligent
With strong opinions.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.862
That's good. Mostly.

36:07.198 --> 36:11.168
But your demeanor,
Your wardrobe,

36:11.202 --> 36:13.503
The way
You comport yourself.

36:13.538 --> 36:19.376
To be a nurse, these are things
You'd have to...Reconsider.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.378
Would i?

36:21.412 --> 36:26.183
What i'm trying to say
As gently as possible,

36:26.217 --> 36:28.385
Is there comes a time
In every woman's growth

36:28.419 --> 36:31.221
When she must put away
Childish things.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.790
You can do it
By choice,

36:33.824 --> 36:38.795
Or you can wait for life
To foist it upon you.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.964
Thank you.

36:40.998 --> 36:44.568
For your...Gentleness.

36:44.602 --> 36:47.571
Oh, perhaps in a year or two,
You may be ready.

36:47.605 --> 36:51.474
But by then, I expect this war
Shall be long over.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.917
Miss emma! Miss emma!

37:00.952 --> 37:02.852
Belinda,
What are you doing here?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.088
Deliveryman
Saw you run off.

37:05.122 --> 37:06.556
Your mama
Is looking for ya.

37:06.591 --> 37:09.159
You need to come with me
Right now.

37:09.193 --> 37:10.827
If we get caught
In here,

37:10.861 --> 37:13.330
I don't want to think
Of the trouble we'll have.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.532
I hate what
You've done with the place.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.600
Belinda, hush.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.802
This used to be known
As one of the finest hotels

37:18.836 --> 37:19.903
On the eastern seaboard.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.739
 and it will be
Again one day, I am sure.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.908
Why are they here
With those yanks?

37:24.942 --> 37:27.844
None of our business!
Miss emma, please.

37:27.878 --> 37:31.748
 yeah,
Enforce the rules.

37:31.782 --> 37:34.384
We fought together,
My dad and me,

37:34.418 --> 37:38.255
Side by side, until the rebs
Got him at kernstown.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.123
And he approved
Of your enlisting?

37:40.157 --> 37:42.125
He knew I couldn't
Stay back at home

37:42.159 --> 37:44.427
And still call myself
A man.

37:44.462 --> 37:47.964
You're not a man.
You're a boy.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.866
I'm 18, reverend.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.870
Between you and me,
I'm 17.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.208
All right, i'm 15 if i'm a day,
But i'll be 16 in october.

37:58.242 --> 37:59.976
I thought as much.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.078
You say a letter home
To your family,

38:02.113 --> 38:04.381
And nurse mary
Will write it down for you.

38:04.415 --> 38:05.115
Certainly, I will.

38:05.149 --> 38:06.383
I must perform
A service.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.785
The man's family has come
All the way from connecticut.

38:08.819 --> 38:10.620
Father?

38:15.660 --> 38:17.494
God is with you,
Boy.

38:17.528 --> 38:20.864
As hard as you fought on the
Field, fight even harder now.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.041
Who will the letter
Be to?

38:31.075 --> 38:36.046
To my mother, eleanor,
And my sisters,

38:36.080 --> 38:43.787
Lucy, nina, charlotte,
And maggie.

38:45.890 --> 38:49.859
Girls all around me. That's
Why i'm such a charmer, miss.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.062
Indeed.

38:52.096 --> 38:54.597
 I strive to be
A gracious host, gentlemen,

38:54.632 --> 38:58.101
But I have yet to receive
A nickel of rent for your --

38:58.135 --> 39:02.238
How do I put it? --
Occupancy in my hotel.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.642
The rent is payable upon
Your pledging the loyalty oath.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.745
Ah, that's a pesky thing,
Isn't it?

39:08.779 --> 39:10.080
There are no exceptions,
Sir.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.248
We enforce the rules
In all fairness.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.617
Fairness, indeed.

39:14.652 --> 39:17.787
You wield this oath
Like a club.

39:17.822 --> 39:21.391
You say you want to be humane
In your occupation here,

39:21.425 --> 39:23.626
But what are my neighbors
And I to think

39:23.661 --> 39:26.129
When the union
Administration behaves

39:26.163 --> 39:28.665
In such
A cold-hearted way?

39:28.699 --> 39:31.634
We'll discuss that
At another time.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.136
Now, for the business
At hand.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.976
My son has been broadening the
Scope of our furniture company.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.045
We have started
Building coffins.

39:42.079 --> 39:43.813
The market,
As you might imagine,

39:43.848 --> 39:44.948
Is distressingly strong.

39:44.982 --> 39:48.084
Well, we are doing our best
To counteract that here.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.187
Yes, but your army is doing
Its best to keep it going.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.889
I've discussed with mr. Bullen
The possibility

39:52.923 --> 39:55.225
Of providing coffins for you
At a rate.

39:55.259 --> 39:58.094
We need to dispose
Of the corpses, sirs.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.629
It'd help to have coffins.

39:59.663 --> 40:00.964
Your business,
By all rights,

40:00.998 --> 40:02.899
Should be shut down, mr. Green.
Sir --

40:02.933 --> 40:04.934
And you ask for us
To aid you?

40:04.969 --> 40:06.936
I ask that we aid
Each other.

40:06.971 --> 40:10.807
You already have most everything
I've spent my life building.

40:10.841 --> 40:15.311
Allow me the dignity to resolve
Myself to your allegiance

40:15.346 --> 40:18.248
Without utterly ruining me
In the meantime.

40:18.282 --> 40:20.750
We must leave now!

40:20.785 --> 40:22.786
It's a two-way street,
Sir, ain't it?

40:22.820 --> 40:27.023
We got bodies.
They got boxes.

40:29.293 --> 40:32.162
My aim is to be out of this bed
And home soon,

40:32.196 --> 40:36.666
But the good lord sees it
A different way.

40:36.700 --> 40:42.005
I prefer to be buried at home,
Near to you.

40:42.039 --> 40:45.642
If that is too much of a chore,
It matters little.

40:45.676 --> 40:50.313
Wheresoever my bodily remains
Come to rest,

40:50.347 --> 40:52.849
My soul shall be keeping company
With dad on high,

40:52.883 --> 40:56.052
Watching over you all,

40:56.086 --> 41:00.924
Ever expectant of our joyful,
Final reunion as a family

41:00.958 --> 41:03.159
In eternity.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.598
How does that seem?

41:10.634 --> 41:13.136
Maybe I should end
With a joke?

41:19.777 --> 41:20.810
Emma?

41:22.112 --> 41:25.315
What's happened
To your dress?

41:26.050 --> 41:28.885
Uh, well, uh,

41:28.919 --> 41:31.888
Miss emma went to market
With miss allerton,

41:31.922 --> 41:34.257
<i>like I said, when thwack!</i>

41:34.291 --> 41:38.094
The butcher slaughtered a pig,
And blood just splattered --

41:38.128 --> 41:41.631
Belinda, that's enough.
Tend the kitchen.

41:47.071 --> 41:49.572
Mother,
I went to look for frank.

41:49.607 --> 41:50.907
At the hotel?

41:50.941 --> 41:53.309
That death house
Is no place for a child.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.544
I'm not a child
Anymore!

41:54.578 --> 41:56.145
You are forbidden
To go there!

41:56.180 --> 41:58.314
Go where?

41:58.349 --> 42:02.952
She's been to the hospital,
Looking for frank stringfellow.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.692
Did you find him?

42:09.727 --> 42:10.693
No, sir, I didn't.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.762
Well, then, that's done.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.430
You will, in the future,

42:14.465 --> 42:16.132
Speak to your mother
With greater respect,

42:16.166 --> 42:20.303
And you will not return
To the hotel.

42:20.337 --> 42:23.840
I'm sorry, mother.
Forgive me.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.742
Of course.

42:30.648 --> 42:34.784
Emma, did you hear
Any news of tom?

42:34.818 --> 42:37.654
Tom fairfax.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.322
I wasn't looking
For tom.

42:39.356 --> 42:41.224
I'll try again
Next time.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.728
Next time?

42:55.005 --> 42:57.340
You live
Over in the bottoms?

42:59.610 --> 43:00.910
You walking there
Tonight?

43:00.945 --> 43:02.579
Mr. Bullen
Got me working on.

43:08.118 --> 43:09.886
I got eyes for you,
Aurelia.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.622
That necklace told me
As much.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.194
My arm!

43:23.233 --> 43:24.167
Ohh.
Mary: soldier!

43:24.201 --> 43:26.703
What is it?

43:26.737 --> 43:28.237
I feel my blood.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.973
It's running dry.
Where are the doctors?

43:30.007 --> 43:32.875
No one left but dr. Foster.
He's got a patient in surgery.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.210
I'll send
For someone else.

43:34.244 --> 43:35.144
Hemorrhage,
Brachial artery.

43:35.179 --> 43:37.246
I'll go myself -- fast.
You need to stay.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.916
Make it stop, please!

43:39.950 --> 43:41.818
This man can't wait.
Forgive me, lord.

43:41.852 --> 43:43.853
Give me some thread.

43:43.887 --> 43:45.154
Samuel, we can't --
Thread.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.595
I-i need more light.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.004
When they removed the bullet,
The blood vessel got ruptured.

44:01.038 --> 44:02.338
They cauterized over it.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.240
It's infected now.
He'll bleed to death.

44:04.274 --> 44:06.809
Oh, no, they're killing me.
Mother, please.

44:06.844 --> 44:10.880
No, I can't let you do this.
We need someone who knows how.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.783
I know how, miss mary.
I know how!

44:14.151 --> 44:18.154
This boy gets saved by a nigger,
Or he dies alone.

44:21.258 --> 44:21.858
My arm!

44:21.892 --> 44:24.394
He needs chloroform.

44:27.831 --> 44:31.000
You need to dampen the cloth
And place it over his mouth.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.902
Yes, i've seen it done.

44:37.241 --> 44:40.276
Help hold
The wound open.

44:42.079 --> 44:44.047
Blood makes me uneasy.

44:44.081 --> 44:46.082
You'll need
To overcome that.

44:50.954 --> 44:52.588
There is the rupture.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.624
Now pinch the artery
For me.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.407
I'll tie a loop
Around it.

45:11.442 --> 45:12.675
Leave an end
Dangling out.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.411
That way, a doctor can pull it
A little every day

45:15.446 --> 45:17.814
Until the thread rots off
And the rupture is closed.

45:17.848 --> 45:20.750
If they don't know how,
You got to tell them.

45:20.784 --> 45:21.718
It's called a ligature.

45:21.752 --> 45:23.553
How will we know
If it worked?

45:23.587 --> 45:27.623
It'll work.
I've done it before.

45:32.963 --> 45:34.664
Dr. Foster:
Miss phinney.

45:39.770 --> 45:41.604
What happened here?

45:41.638 --> 45:42.939
He was in grave pain.

45:42.973 --> 45:44.807
The wound
Was hemorrhaging, so --

45:44.842 --> 45:45.975
Who tied this ligature?

45:46.009 --> 45:47.977
I did.

45:49.146 --> 45:50.847
Miss dix
Trained me how.

45:50.881 --> 45:52.515
Miss dix?

45:52.549 --> 45:53.783
And who trained her?

45:54.985 --> 45:56.753
Every day,
We'll need to --

45:56.787 --> 46:00.323
Pull on the end until the thread
Rots and the rupture closes.

46:15.239 --> 46:17.240
I've got a patient
On the table.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.281
Dr. Berenson taught me things
When I was little.

46:27.017 --> 46:29.585
Ever since,
I just kept on learning.

46:49.840 --> 46:53.976
Are you all right,
Dr. Foster?

46:54.011 --> 46:56.179
Well.

46:58.715 --> 47:00.216
I'm well.

47:04.788 --> 47:08.624
By way of advice,
Nowhere does it say

47:08.659 --> 47:11.093
We get to favor
The patients we approve of.

47:11.128 --> 47:14.630
In here, this is only one type
Of soldier -- the wounded.

47:16.133 --> 47:17.133
No room yet?

47:17.167 --> 47:19.502
No. I'm --

47:19.536 --> 47:22.738
Well, the matron
Will surely be by soon.

47:22.773 --> 47:26.642
If I may,
By way of advice?

47:28.078 --> 47:30.947
Your views on race
Are unenlightened.

47:38.956 --> 47:41.791
I grew up
On a maryland plantation.

47:41.825 --> 47:44.126
I was rolling cigars
With the slaves

47:44.161 --> 47:46.128
When I was
Barely walking.

47:46.163 --> 47:48.130
We had 64 of them
At one point.

47:48.165 --> 47:52.134
A union surgeon from
A slave-holding family.

47:52.169 --> 47:53.870
You are full
Of surprises, doctor.

47:53.904 --> 47:58.541
My point being, I know more
Of these things than you do.

47:58.575 --> 48:00.209
I know right
From wrong.

48:00.244 --> 48:02.645
And I can tell
When i'm talking to someone

48:02.679 --> 48:03.846
Who also knows
The difference.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.716
You want to challenge me
On slavery?

48:06.750 --> 48:08.084
It's not our concern.

48:08.118 --> 48:09.785
Isn't it?
No.

48:09.820 --> 48:14.957
We keep men alive,
So what I am asking, demanding,

48:14.992 --> 48:17.660
Is that you see
Every soldier as equal,

48:17.694 --> 48:19.528
No matter what side
He fights on.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.864
This is a union facility
For union soldiers!

48:21.899 --> 48:24.267
It is a hospital
For sick people!

48:26.169 --> 48:29.505
Blood is not gray
Or blue, madam.

48:29.539 --> 48:30.806
It's all one color.

48:58.969 --> 49:02.104
Put away childish things.

49:31.902 --> 49:36.772
How many lives will you save
Before this is over?

49:40.877 --> 49:42.545
Miss phinney?

49:42.579 --> 49:44.714
Bursting at the seams,
We are.

49:44.748 --> 49:48.851
Dr. Summers felt it best
That you sleep here.

49:48.885 --> 49:50.853
Uh, on the floor.

49:50.887 --> 49:52.555
Uh, uh,
Beware of the arsenic.

49:52.589 --> 49:55.057
You might want to sweep
Your area.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.225
Arsenic?

49:56.259 --> 49:58.227
We put it out
For the rats.

49:58.261 --> 50:00.763
Uh, you'll want to look out
For them, as well.

50:00.797 --> 50:02.665
Here.

50:18.949 --> 50:21.751
Yes! Whoo! Whoo!

50:21.785 --> 50:23.619
We whooped them
In williamsburg!

50:23.653 --> 50:25.388
The rebs are beating it
To richmond!

50:25.422 --> 50:28.924
Is it so?
We'll be done with this thing
In a week, for sure!

50:28.959 --> 50:30.192
On to richmond!

50:30.227 --> 50:31.894
I knew it!

50:34.931 --> 50:38.601
Whoo!
Victory, brothers! Victory!

50:48.678 --> 50:51.680
I told him that I would be
Right back for him.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.118
But I took too long.

51:03.994 --> 51:08.030
He never finished it.

51:23.013 --> 51:27.149
"though my last breath...

51:27.184 --> 51:29.151
May come soon...

51:29.186 --> 51:30.719
When it does,

51:30.754 --> 51:35.958
Know that I shall be thinking
Only of you

51:35.992 --> 51:40.129
And my eternal...

51:40.163 --> 51:42.164
Hope."

52:24.274 --> 52:25.808
Sign it! Or
We will remove you from
Your house.

52:25.842 --> 52:27.743
They will take
Everything we have.

52:27.777 --> 52:30.146
There's work to
Do here work that matters.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.180
Dr. Foster

52:31.214 --> 52:33.182
Where were we when
This whole mess started?

52:34.184 --> 52:35.117
Leave her be!

52:35.152 --> 52:36.819
Or by god, i'll
Kill you myself!

52:38.054 --> 52:39.955
Union scout this is what
Happens to traitors!

52:39.990 --> 52:41.157
Hale: the situation
Is intolerable.

52:41.191 --> 52:43.092
  we will not traffic
With extremists!

52:43.126 --> 52:45.261
We must win this
War at any cost!

52:45.295 --> 52:47.897
 let go of the rope!
