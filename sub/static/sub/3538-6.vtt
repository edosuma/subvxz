Last time you were in here,
I helped you out, didn't I?

05:49.178 --> 05:53.011
And I'd like
to help you again,

05:53.095 --> 05:55.512
but we know what you did.

05:55.595 --> 05:58.470
We know.

05:58.553 --> 06:00.637
So for me to help,

06:00.720 --> 06:02.679
you gotta own up to it.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.637
You saw those guys out there.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.345
They're Reilly's boys,

06:06.428 --> 06:09.261
and they don't give a shit
about why you did it,

06:09.345 --> 06:12.136
how you might
have been justified.

06:12.220 --> 06:14.679
But if you don't talk to me,

06:14.762 --> 06:16.136
it'll be out of my hands,

06:16.220 --> 06:18.220
and those guys
will get their turn,

06:18.303 --> 06:20.553
and I don't have to tell you
how that's gonna go.

06:24.011 --> 06:25.887
Son, this isn't
a put-up job.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.136
We can make
our case already.

out of you

06:29.970 --> 06:31.303

06:31.387 --> 06:34.303
I saw it, and so did
a dozen other guys.

06:34.387 --> 06:36.428
So we know you had a reason
for wanting him dead.

06:36.512 --> 06:38.637
And we got a witness
who puts you at the scene

06:38.720 --> 06:39.637
when he got rolled.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.011
The girl
down in Sonoratown,

06:43.095 --> 06:44.178
and she'll testify.

06:44.261 --> 06:46.220
She won't have a choice.

06:46.303 --> 06:48.178
Reilly's mob
will make damn sure of it.

06:48.261 --> 06:50.053
Motive and a witness:

06:50.136 --> 06:52.595
that's enough to convict
right there.

06:57.261 --> 06:59.095
First that family
from Beverly Hills

06:59.178 --> 07:00.512

07:02.428 --> 07:03.929
And four God-fearing
white police officers

07:04.011 --> 07:06.095
end up in the morgue.

07:06.178 --> 07:08.178
Now we got another dead cop.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.220
Half the city's out for blood

07:10.303 --> 07:12.512
just like those bull necks
in the squad room.

07:12.595 --> 07:16.470
And all they want
is someone to blame...

07:18.345 --> 07:22.053
...someone who looks
like you and me.

07:23.303 --> 07:25.887
So when they find him,

07:25.970 --> 07:28.387
when they find you,

to just put you away.

13:43.595 --> 13:46.345
from those that he touches.

13:46.428 --> 13:47.845
Think of Jesus.

13:47.929 --> 13:49.428
I'm not Jesus.

13:49.512 --> 13:53.595
No, you're Sister Molly.

13:53.679 --> 13:57.136
Sister Molly is just
the one on the stage.

13:57.220 --> 14:00.679
Is that what you told him?

14:00.762 --> 14:03.679
It's just a line, dear.

14:03.762 --> 14:07.345
It's a silly slogan
you like to repeat.

14:07.428 --> 14:08.887
I've known you
all of your life,

14:08.970 --> 14:12.595

been one of you.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.804
That's all I ever see,
just you.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.720
No, I'm not sure you do see me.

14:21.887 --> 14:25.720
It will be your flock
who makes you choose,

14:25.804 --> 14:27.720
not God.

14:27.804 --> 14:30.011
They need to feel
as if you're married

14:30.095 --> 14:32.929
only to the church.

14:33.011 --> 14:36.136
Without that, your power
over them will be lost.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.428
Or yours will.

14:38.512 --> 14:41.637
Yes, both of ours...

14:41.720 --> 14:45.095
and the soup kitchen
and the girls' home,

14:45.178 --> 14:49.011
the medical clinic,
the gift drive at Christmas...

14:50.929 --> 14:52.762
...to say nothing
of the salvation

14:52.845 --> 14:56.345
you offer to all of those
who come to you in need,

14:56.428 --> 14:58.512
all the good work
you do in the world.

14:58.595 --> 15:00.428
All of it can go away.

15:03.762 --> 15:07.387

plain old Molly wants?

16:07.387 --> 16:09.845
I grew up in Hermosa Beach,

16:09.929 --> 16:11.887
learned to swim
before I could walk.

16:12.011 --> 16:14.887
Got my first board
not long after that.

16:14.970 --> 16:17.178
I didn't know Hitler
was recruiting in Hermosa.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.970
My favorite thing in the world
used to be

16:30.053 --> 16:31.970
paddling out
just past the break

16:32.053 --> 16:33.261
in Hermosa Pier

16:33.345 --> 16:35.804
or Long Beach,

16:35.887 --> 16:37.762
turning around to look
at the strip

16:37.845 --> 16:41.136
of clean white sand
under a blue sky.

16:46.428 --> 16:48.095
Then the mongrels came.

16:49.470 --> 16:52.512
Mongrels?

16:52.595 --> 16:57.512
The Chinks, spics, spades,
you name it.

16:57.595 --> 17:00.345
More and more of them
every year.

17:00.428 --> 17:01.804
I used to see the way

17:01.887 --> 17:03.637
they were overrunning
this place and wonder,

17:03.720 --> 17:06.512
"Why does nobody say anything?

17:06.595 --> 17:08.303
Why is this allowed?"

17:10.553 --> 17:13.303
And then I heard
about the Fuehrer,

17:13.387 --> 17:16.136
and I read Mein Kampf.

17:16.220 --> 17:20.887
Finally, here was someone
speaking the plain truth.

17:22.887 --> 17:25.136
Felt like such a relief.

17:27.595 --> 17:31.637
I knew then
that I'd move to Berlin,

17:31.720 --> 17:33.303
that I could be happy.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.387
Were you...happy there?

17:35.470 --> 17:38.887
I was...

17:38.970 --> 17:42.053
until I earned
my Gestapo commission

17:42.136 --> 17:46.553
and they gave me
my first assignment:

17:46.637 --> 17:49.011
to come back here

17:49.095 --> 17:52.887
to this filthy city I thought
I'd never have to see again.

18:01.637 --> 18:04.512
I love this city.

18:04.595 --> 18:08.595
Do you know who I saw yesterday
just walking down Robertson?

18:08.679 --> 18:10.804
Fred Astaire.

18:10.887 --> 18:12.804
Just like that, there he was.

18:12.887 --> 18:15.637
He looked just like himself.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.720
That's what I wanted to be,

18:18.804 --> 18:21.470
a dancer like that,
a song and dance man,

18:21.553 --> 18:23.887

18:37.679 --> 18:39.804
That you saw Fred Astaire?

18:39.887 --> 18:41.887
That I could be Fred Astaire.

18:45.178 --> 18:49.303
LA doesn't care who you are

18:49.387 --> 18:53.220
It only cares about who

Let us be frank
with each other

19:08.804 --> 19:12.887

19:12.970 --> 19:15.720
You haven't been happy.

19:15.804 --> 19:17.970
We both know it.

But you're the one
deciding this for both of us.

19:23.679 --> 19:26.970
Because the fault
is mine.

19:32.929 --> 19:35.178
But is happiness everything?

19:37.053 --> 19:40.303
Because I can be happier.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.470
If that's what you want,
I can change.

19:42.553 --> 19:43.303

she's not a mother.

19:52.804 --> 19:54.512
They will have a mother.

19:58.595 --> 19:59.845
If you think

19:59.929 --> 20:01.887
you are bringing
that German whore

20:01.970 --> 20:03.970

20:04.053 --> 20:07.970

No authority in the state

20:27.553 --> 20:30.512
You will be checking in

20:30.595 --> 20:33.011

24:13.136 --> 24:17.553
So...you're looking at these

24:17.637 --> 24:22.720
with Officer Reilly's widow
sitting ten feet away

24:22.804 --> 24:23.887
and his three kids,

24:23.970 --> 24:25.387

24:25.470 --> 24:28.387
bright and pink
in their church clothes,

24:28.470 --> 24:30.970

who did it,

24:31.053 --> 24:33.261
he's sitting there too,

24:33.345 --> 24:36.845
and you gotta decide
what to do with him.

24:36.929 --> 24:40.053
This guy, you don't know.

24:40.136 --> 24:42.387
Name's Luther Jones.

24:42.470 --> 24:45.637
Killed some people
in Nevada last year.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.095
And this...

24:48.178 --> 24:49.512
is after they pulled him out

24:49.595 --> 24:52.136
of the gas chamber
in Carson City.

24:53.553 --> 24:56.136
Looks like he had fun
in there, doesn't it?

24:59.929 --> 25:03.387
The gas they use, cyanide,

25:03.470 --> 25:06.595
I guess it turns
your skin purple.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.428
They strap you to the chair
in just your underwear

25:08.512 --> 25:11.178
so none of it gets caught
in your clothes.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.595
That's how nasty the shit is.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.428
And they tell you

25:15.512 --> 25:18.512
to take a few deep breaths
when it starts

25:18.595 --> 25:21.887
because that will make things

25:32.470 --> 25:34.136
You know the stuff's

26:45.804 --> 26:48.512
It's Friday night.

26:48.595 --> 26:50.720
You got a face beat to raw pulp

26:50.804 --> 26:52.887
and your whole life

All right.

27:06.762 --> 27:09.512
And he'll tell it the same
if we ask him?

27:09.595 --> 27:12.929
Oh, sure, he will.
He's my brother, right?

27:13.011 --> 27:15.345
He'd do anything for me.

27:15.428 --> 27:18.303
Just how it is with brothers,
you know?

27:18.387 --> 27:20.303
You got a brother, Officer?

27:20.387 --> 27:23.261
What did the two of you
do that night?

27:23.345 --> 27:25.345
Went down to the river,

27:25.428 --> 27:27.345
tried to catch ourselves
something to eat, you know?

27:27.428 --> 27:28.929

27:32.345 --> 27:34.762

in the water myself

27:34.845 --> 27:36.095

27:37.845 --> 27:40.136
Can't dig on no animal

27:40.220 --> 27:42.345
you know what I mean?

27:42.428 --> 27:45.762
Nah, we go down there
for birds.

27:45.845 --> 27:49.303
These little mud hens,
nervous little fuckers.

27:49.387 --> 27:51.428
That's how you catch 'em.

27:51.512 --> 27:53.470
You just lay back in the reeds,

27:53.553 --> 27:55.553
wait till they get up
out the water.

27:55.637 --> 27:57.679
Then you jump out real quick.

27:57.762 --> 28:02.387
You scare 'em bad enough,
and they just faint,

28:02.470 --> 28:04.804
fall down and lie there
like a bitch.

28:04.887 --> 28:08.762
Must be the stupidest
fucking birds in the world.

28:08.845 --> 28:13.387
Then you stroll over,
nice and easy,

28:13.470 --> 28:17.929
and you snap their damn neck.

28:18.011 --> 28:21.220
Taste pretty good, though,
the way my ma cooks them up.

28:25.970 --> 28:29.970
They're playing dead.

28:30.053 --> 28:31.804
That's what they're doing,

28:31.887 --> 28:33.387
not fainting.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.220
Playing dead.

28:35.303 --> 28:37.178
Play dead, get dead.

28:37.261 --> 28:39.303
Just don't seem
like a real bright move.

28:39.387 --> 28:40.595
That's all I'm saying.

28:40.679 --> 28:45.345
So...this is like what,
a fucking parable?

28:45.428 --> 28:48.345
Hey, man, I'm just talking.

28:48.428 --> 28:50.387
I like talking to you.

28:50.470 --> 28:53.553
Better than Mr. Angry
over here.

28:53.637 --> 28:57.345
Hey, Angry, I'm getting
kind of parched again.

28:57.428 --> 28:59.845
How about this time,
you go and get the Nehi

28:59.929 --> 29:02.512
so me and him
can keep up the chitchat?

29:06.762 --> 29:08.428
We're done with all that shit.

29:08.512 --> 29:11.011
No, we're just getting started.

29:11.095 --> 29:12.804
I like talking,

29:12.887 --> 29:16.804
and I got a lot more to say,
believe me.

neighborhoods uptown,

47:47.053 --> 47:49.970
mansions
and swank apartment houses,

47:50.053 --> 47:53.720
and everything
was just so clean.

47:57.220 --> 47:59.970
That's what I remember most:

48:00.053 --> 48:04.804
whole damn world was knee-deep
in horse shit back then

48:04.887 --> 48:08.053
but not Fifth Avenue,
not Uptown.

48:10.053 --> 48:13.929
It's like the horses up there
didn't shit at all.

48:15.553 --> 48:17.887
It's different now--

48:17.970 --> 48:22.178
no more horses--

48:22.261 --> 48:25.011
except that it's not really
any different.

48:26.512 --> 48:28.762
You know what I mean?

48:30.053 --> 48:34.929
Poor folks will always
be left with the shit...

48:35.762 --> 48:37.845
...whatever the shit is,

48:37.929 --> 48:40.595
and there ain't a damn thing
God or Franklin Roosevelt

48:40.679 --> 48:44.720
will ever do to change it.

48:44.804 --> 48:47.387
Take a man like James Hazlett.

48:47.470 --> 48:52.053
Big construction outfit,
big house in Beverly Hills.

48:52.136 --> 48:56.679
Guy like that turns up dead
on the wrong side of town

48:56.762 --> 49:01.053
with his dead wife and kids
right next to him?

49:01.136 --> 49:04.512
Well, that's a big old
steaming pile of shit,

49:04.595 --> 49:07.720
the kind that only ever leads

49:07.804 --> 49:11.637
to more and more shit:

49:11.720 --> 49:15.512
the riot, four dead cops,

49:15.595 --> 49:19.470
eight dead Mexicans,

49:19.553 --> 49:23.053
Reilly cuffing you
to that chair.

49:25.637 --> 49:29.220
Shit begets shit...

49:30.553 --> 49:32.804
...begets shit.

♪ somber music ♪

49:37.512 --> 49:41.637
And now...

49:41.720 --> 49:43.762
just look where we are.

49:54.679 --> 49:59.303
But if you go back
to the beginning,

49:59.387 --> 50:02.512
Hazlett was the beginning.

50:06.762 --> 50:09.261
You killed him.

50:09.345 --> 50:10.512
What?

50:10.595 --> 50:12.261
Him, the wife, the kids.

50:12.345 --> 50:13.929
Reilly too, of course.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.178
I know you want to talk
about Tiago's brother,

50:17.261 --> 50:19.637
but I don't give a fuck
about Tiago's brother,

50:19.720 --> 50:21.970
and neither should you.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.011
All day,

50:24.095 --> 50:26.220
you been playing this
like a gambler

50:26.303 --> 50:29.178
sitting on a full house,

50:29.261 --> 50:33.804
but let me tell you what cards
you're really holding.

50:33.887 --> 50:38.303
You're going to San Quentin,
and you're not coming out.

50:38.387 --> 50:40.929
That's gospel already.

50:41.011 --> 50:43.512
All you still get to decide

50:43.595 --> 50:45.887
is whether you go as a rat

50:45.970 --> 50:49.470
or as a goddamn legend.

50:49.553 --> 50:52.553
Now, that seems like
a pretty simple choice to me,

50:52.637 --> 50:54.804
but let me spell it out
for you.

50:54.887 --> 50:58.178
Rats don't do so well
up in Quentin.

50:58.261 --> 51:01.345
They tend to hang themselves
with the bedsheets

51:01.428 --> 51:02.679
after the rest of the cons

51:02.762 --> 51:06.011
have fucked them bloody
for a while.

51:06.095 --> 51:10.011
But guys who take the weight,

51:10.095 --> 51:12.387
they have it pretty good
up there.

51:14.428 --> 51:19.637
And the more weight they take,
the better they have it.

51:19.720 --> 51:23.095
Scrawny little half-pint
like yourself

51:23.178 --> 51:26.011
who dumped a whole family
of swells in the river,

51:26.095 --> 51:29.637
then went out and slit
a bad cop's throat,

51:29.720 --> 51:31.970
who signed his name
to all of that

51:32.053 --> 51:35.011
just to take the heat
off his neighborhood

51:35.095 --> 51:39.178
and make sure his pals
got away scot-free?

51:39.261 --> 51:44.220
Guy like that might just be
the king of San Quentin,

51:44.303 --> 51:48.804
might just get his picture up
in every bodega in town.

51:48.887 --> 51:51.970
A hero to his people...

51:54.887 --> 51:56.887
...assuming word got around

51:56.970 --> 52:00.053
about what he did,

52:00.136 --> 52:04.178
and I can see to that,
believe me.

52:04.261 --> 52:06.637
We'll see to it.

52:10.178 --> 52:12.804
Or just like that,
I'll make sure everyone knows

52:12.887 --> 52:16.053
what kind of rat you are,

52:16.136 --> 52:18.428
if that's the way
you want to go.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.929
Up to you.

52:26.387 --> 52:28.970
You got about five minutes
to make up your mind

52:29.053 --> 52:31.220
before those other guys
come in here

52:31.303 --> 52:33.512
and start putting cigars out
on your tongue.

52:48.804 --> 52:50.595
You kill them all?

52:55.303 --> 52:57.178
All by yourself?

53:11.845 --> 53:14.387
That's the smart play, kid.
