00:00.158 --> 00:02.914
Perviously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.914 --> 00:04.893
Look, Amy, you *** facts.

00:04.893 --> 00:08.879
Young men of certain age ***

00:08.879 --> 00:11.143
You can't be *** You're not ***

00:11.143 --> 00:12.929
Come on, don't *** it.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.108
It's not even ***

00:14.108 --> 00:17.431
She hasn't decided *** ,
no matter whose ***

00:17.431 --> 00:18.515

00:24.053 --> 00:26.814

00:26.814 --> 00:30.016
And now ***

00:30.016 --> 00:31.793

00:31.793 --> 00:33.228

00:33.228 --> 00:34.526
I lost my ***

00:34.526 --> 00:35.777
I knew that, ***

00:35.777 --> 00:37.483

00:37.483 --> 00:39.223
My dad ***

00:39.223 --> 00:41.706

00:51.879 --> 00:52.807
Thank you.

00:52.807 --> 00:56.361
Put the little ***

00:56.361 --> 00:58.941
And it'll completly clear your mind.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.197
She'll be here.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.688
I hope so. 
I skipped breakfast for this.

01:07.688 --> 01:09.971
Are you sure Grace *** much,

01:09.971 --> 01:11.470
We shall be meeting again so soon?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.344
I mean, maybe it's too soon.

01:13.584 --> 01:15.707
No. I think *** talk.

01:15.707 --> 01:17.094
It's help for me.

01:17.094 --> 01:18.134
Yeah, me too.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.038
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

01:20.038 --> 01:20.903
What's up?

01:23.731 --> 01:24.486
Jack?

01:25.867 --> 01:27.728
It's just that this is the last chance

01:27.728 --> 01:29.322
for all of us to be
together before summer,

01:29.322 --> 01:31.425
so we thought we'd all get together

01:31.425 --> 01:33.491
and, you know, lend our support

01:33.491 --> 01:35.338
before we all go our separate ways.

01:35.338 --> 01:36.859
Our separate ways?

01:37.587 --> 01:38.922
Are you going to football camp?

01:39.421 --> 01:40.639
If you decided to leave
and go to football camp,

01:40.639 --> 01:41.521
you could have just told me.

01:41.521 --> 01:43.140
Is that what this is about?

01:43.336 --> 01:45.250
Jack, I had a few things
to do this morning,

01:45.250 --> 01:46.213
so if this is personal--

01:46.213 --> 01:48.781
You know, even if it is,
we just want you to know

01:48.781 --> 01:52.574
that you have our support
any time you need it, Grace.

01:52.574 --> 01:54.631
- "Our"?
- You know, all of us...

01:55.121 --> 01:58.014
without a birth parent,
because of death.

01:58.014 --> 01:59.534
We all have that in common.

01:59.534 --> 02:02.295
Yeah, and we just figured that
maybe every once in a while

02:02.295 --> 02:03.689
we could get together.

02:04.092 --> 02:05.005
Not this summer, though.

02:05.005 --> 02:07.887
This summer we could just
e-mail or text or something.

02:07.887 --> 02:10.320
So I wouldn't feel alone if
Jack goes to football camp.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.674
I have to go. 
I don't have any choice.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.228
And I have to go to Italy.

02:13.228 --> 02:17.196
And I have no place to
go, so I'll be around.

02:17.196 --> 02:18.900
You should go to football camp.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.515
I told you to go to football camp.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.659
- But you didn't mean it. 
- Yes, I did mean it.

02:22.659 --> 02:23.669
Then you go to cheer camp.

02:23.669 --> 02:25.391
I'll go to football
camp just like last year.

02:25.391 --> 02:27.735
No. It's not like last year.
I don't want to go anywhere.

02:28.075 --> 02:29.808
I just want to stay at
home with my mom and Tom.

02:29.808 --> 02:31.414
And that's fine. 
That's fine.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.207
We all have to deal with
loss in our own personal way.

02:35.207 --> 02:37.175
Maybe yours is by spending
time with your family.

02:37.175 --> 02:38.713
Jack, I'm going to kill you.

02:38.713 --> 02:42.368
Yeah. Although, we did
just want to help you guys.

02:42.624 --> 02:43.505
I don't need any help.

02:43.505 --> 02:44.986
Well, everyone needs help.

02:44.986 --> 02:47.084
Not everyone, but I imagine
you need help right now.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.248
You know, with your dad
marrying an Internet prostitute.

02:49.248 --> 02:50.915
Oh, Grace, not now.

02:50.915 --> 02:53.363
What, baby? 
I can help Ben with that.

02:53.494 --> 02:54.578
Me, too.

02:54.578 --> 02:55.692
Meeting adjourned.

02:55.692 --> 02:56.900
I second that.

03:06.781 --> 03:08.692
You ready for the last day of school?

03:09.053 --> 03:11.736
Yeah, except for
sending my boyfriend off

03:11.736 --> 03:13.664
to the oral sex capital of the world.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.808
Amy, that's ridiculous and you know it.

03:15.808 --> 03:17.871
You know you can't go with
him when you have to work.

03:17.871 --> 03:19.158
At least I'll get to sleep in.

03:19.483 --> 03:21.056
I really need some sleep.

03:21.056 --> 03:21.971
If you don't have school,

03:21.971 --> 03:23.859
then you have to go to the
church nursery and work.

03:23.859 --> 03:26.547
You're not limited to after-school
hours during the summer.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.016
That's not what you
were thinking, is it?

03:28.016 --> 03:29.729
- Yeah.
- Come on, Amy.

03:29.729 --> 03:31.753
You have the whole
day, and you owe them.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.356
Hey. Dad said to give
me a ride to school.

03:34.725 --> 03:37.253
He's taking the scenic
route to work on his bike.

03:37.253 --> 03:38.684
Yeah, he told me.

03:38.684 --> 03:39.808
He could have dropped you off,

03:39.808 --> 03:41.232
and then come back and gotten his bike.

03:41.232 --> 03:44.791
What happened to the idea of you and
your father being self-sufficient?

03:44.791 --> 03:46.248
The road to hell and all that?

03:46.248 --> 03:47.707
I'm just happy that
he's responsible enough

03:47.707 --> 03:49.794
not to put you on the back of his bike.

04:08.239 --> 04:09.218
George?

04:10.353 --> 04:11.603
George Juergens?

04:11.603 --> 04:14.228
The one and only. 
Do we know each other?

04:14.710 --> 04:16.123
You've been served.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.226
Have a nice day.

05:03.755 --> 05:04.883
Did you see the yearbook?

05:04.883 --> 05:05.772
No.

05:06.286 --> 05:07.632
Well, they gave them out in homeroom.

05:07.632 --> 05:08.879
I was late.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.126
Here, I have yours.

05:11.710 --> 05:12.566
Where were you?

05:12.566 --> 05:15.582
Where I always am
and will always be--

05:15.582 --> 05:16.576
the nursery with John.

05:16.576 --> 05:19.313
Well, look at the annual.

05:19.313 --> 05:21.507
Tell me what you think. 
I think I did a really good job.

05:21.507 --> 05:24.263
I'm especially proud of my
write-up on the drama club.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.347
How did this get in here?

05:28.347 --> 05:29.245
I don't know.

05:29.765 --> 05:32.275
Someone took a picture of you
and then put it in the layout.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.575
She means how did you
let it get in there?

05:34.575 --> 05:36.751
I don't have the power to veto anything.

05:36.751 --> 05:37.545
And why would I?

05:37.545 --> 05:40.049
I mean, freshmen never
get showcased like that.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.091
Madison, are you--

05:41.091 --> 05:42.436
Now I'm going to be remembered

05:42.436 --> 05:44.508
for the rest of my life
as the pregnant girl.

05:44.508 --> 05:45.431
Well, but you--

05:45.431 --> 05:47.545
Don't want to be remembered
as the pregnant girl.

05:47.545 --> 05:48.668
Of course not.

05:48.668 --> 05:49.727
You're not helping.

05:54.275 --> 05:56.421
All anyone is ever going
to remember about me

05:56.421 --> 05:58.310
is that I was the pregnant girl!

06:01.560 --> 06:04.285
You couldn't have stopped them
from putting that picture in there?

06:04.593 --> 06:05.526
I don't know.

06:05.526 --> 06:07.701
I kind of thought it was a good picture.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.515
That's because we don't just think
of her as "the pregnant girl."

06:10.515 --> 06:12.170
No, of course not.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.002
I mean, she's our best friend.

06:14.446 --> 06:17.227
Did you tell her you're going
on vacation with me this summer?

06:19.166 --> 06:20.450
We'll tell her after.

06:29.468 --> 06:30.578
How's the new place?

06:30.578 --> 06:31.721
I got it all cleaned up

06:31.721 --> 06:33.201
and I'm just about all moved in.

06:33.201 --> 06:35.000
Tonight's the first night
I'll be staying there.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.464
I know. Want me to come over?

06:37.918 --> 06:39.770
I can tell my parents I'm
staying at Grace's house.

06:39.770 --> 06:42.212
I don't know, Adrian. I'd kind
of like to get settled before--

06:42.212 --> 06:43.244
Before?

06:43.244 --> 06:44.707
Before I have any company.

06:44.707 --> 06:46.308
I'm not company, am I?

06:46.308 --> 06:50.428
Besides, I want to give you
a proper housewarming present.

06:50.831 --> 06:51.684
We'll see.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.218
- "We'll see"?
- Yeah, we'll see.

06:54.296 --> 06:55.437
What does that mean?

06:55.437 --> 06:57.396
It means we'll see.

06:57.396 --> 07:00.262
I thought you got your own apartment
so we could have a place to be alone.

07:00.262 --> 07:03.853
I got my own apartment because I'm
a responsible guy with a kid now.

07:04.450 --> 07:05.636
I'm serious.

07:05.636 --> 07:06.967
- Yeah.
- I am.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.567
Why are you laughing? 
Don't laugh at me.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.639
I'm sorry.

07:09.639 --> 07:12.791
It's just that you sound so earnest.

07:12.791 --> 07:14.463
And that's a bad thing, being earnest?

07:14.463 --> 07:15.858
No, but, look,

07:15.858 --> 07:18.113
even a guy who's earnest
about being responsible

07:18.113 --> 07:20.402
and taking care of his son wants sex.

07:21.157 --> 07:22.600
Let me come over tonight.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.745
We'll see.

07:26.628 --> 07:28.159
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

07:28.428 --> 07:29.942
It's okay. 
I told you, it's okay.

07:29.942 --> 07:31.431
- I'm over it.
- Yeah, but it's not okay.

07:31.431 --> 07:32.800
I'd rather hang out all summer with you.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.193
But you can't.

07:34.193 --> 07:36.689
He has to go. Sorry.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.400
You told the coach I
didn't want you to go?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.766
I had to have a reason.

07:42.147 --> 07:43.517
You don't have to have
a reason not to go,

07:43.517 --> 07:45.527
because you should go to football camp.

07:45.527 --> 07:46.742
You're the captain of the football team.

07:46.742 --> 07:48.045
And you should go to cheer camp

07:48.045 --> 07:49.213
because you're a cheerleader.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.509
I don't want to go to cheer camp.

07:50.509 --> 07:51.571
I don't want to be a cheerleader.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.171
I just don't feel like cheering,

07:53.171 --> 07:54.749
and I might not for a long time.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.797
Grace! Today's the
deadline for signing up.

07:56.797 --> 07:58.431
You have to go. 
It's the rule.

07:58.431 --> 07:59.937
It's not the rule if I quit.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.225
Oh, don't quit, Grace.
We want you there.

08:02.225 --> 08:03.444
It's not for another few weeks.

08:03.444 --> 08:04.723
You'll feel better by then.

08:04.723 --> 08:05.758
And if I don't?

08:05.758 --> 08:08.422
Then go anyway,
because if you don't--

08:08.422 --> 08:09.247
I know.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.350
You're quitting cheerleading?

08:15.855 --> 08:17.815
Have you ever seen a
cheerleader in mourning?

08:18.647 --> 08:19.694
I don't know.

08:19.694 --> 08:21.428
See? This is something
we could have discussed

08:21.428 --> 08:22.764
in the meeting this morning.

08:22.764 --> 08:23.974
Are there cheerleaders in mourning?

08:23.974 --> 08:26.462
You're really getting on my
nerves. You know that, Jack?

08:35.158 --> 08:36.486
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

08:36.486 --> 08:38.350
<i>What's so buon about it?</i>

08:38.350 --> 08:41.168
Looks like somebody's about to head
off to Italy with a sour attitude.

08:41.168 --> 08:42.945
Yeah? Well, you'd have
a sour attitude, too,

08:42.945 --> 08:45.369
if you knew your father
was engaged to a prostitute.

08:45.369 --> 08:46.617
We're going through this again?

08:46.908 --> 08:49.437
I thought we decided that
Betty is just a well-built,

08:49.437 --> 08:51.796
worldly woman with
questionable fashion sense.

08:51.796 --> 08:52.646
We did.

08:53.761 --> 08:56.854
But this morning I got an
independent confirmation

08:56.854 --> 08:59.084
- that she is a-- 
- A lady of the evening?

08:59.708 --> 09:01.239
- I like her.
- We know that.

09:01.239 --> 09:03.414
I can't just go off and
leave her with him, can I?

09:03.414 --> 09:04.624
Are you sure he doesn't know?

09:04.624 --> 09:06.329
Yeah, come on. I mean,
he slept with her.

09:06.329 --> 09:08.359
- He knows. He's not--
- Neh. Be careful.

09:08.359 --> 09:10.097
It's my dad you're talking about here.

09:10.097 --> 09:12.401
And I don't think that he knows.

09:12.401 --> 09:14.581
No. He-- He can't know.

09:14.581 --> 09:15.912
He thinks she's a court reporter.

09:15.912 --> 09:18.250
- If he doesn't know...
- You have to tell him.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.506
Betty is the first woman he's had
feelings for since my mom died.

09:21.790 --> 09:24.082
If I tell him, it could kill him.

09:24.082 --> 09:26.954
But if you don't tell
him, she could kill him.

09:26.954 --> 09:28.180
I'd like to be killed like that.

09:28.180 --> 09:29.422
Shut up, Henry.

09:29.422 --> 09:32.532
This is so not the conversation
anyone wants to have with a parent.

09:32.696 --> 09:34.869
Before you talk to him,
you should talk to Betty.

09:34.869 --> 09:37.308
- Because?
- Because she might not be around

09:37.308 --> 09:38.191
after he talks to his dad.

09:38.191 --> 09:39.470
And she might have some pointers

09:39.470 --> 09:41.014
that might come in handy this summer.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.869
Are you sure she's a prostitute?

09:43.869 --> 09:45.317
You'd better make sure.

09:45.317 --> 09:46.758
Or I could do that.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.346
You know what? 
I need Amy.

09:53.346 --> 09:54.689
I need to talk to Amy.

09:54.689 --> 09:56.665
Did you see her picture in the yearbook?

10:02.965 --> 10:04.513
So what's going on?

10:04.902 --> 10:07.009
You probably know report
cards are coming out.

10:07.009 --> 10:09.091
Yeah. They usually do
at the end of the year.

10:09.091 --> 10:10.761
Well, there's some things on yours

10:10.761 --> 10:12.596
you won't like very much.

10:12.596 --> 10:14.930
Like what?
 Am I failing a class?

10:15.850 --> 10:18.090
I'm not failing a class, am I?

10:18.090 --> 10:20.572
Or classes? 
No, you're not failing.

10:20.631 --> 10:22.331
You're incomplete.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.561
Incomplete like I have
to do some more work

10:24.561 --> 10:25.763
before I can get my report card?

10:25.763 --> 10:27.734
More like incomplete
so you're going to have

10:27.734 --> 10:29.805
to go to summer school
to complete the year.

10:30.248 --> 10:31.597
It's not that bad.

10:31.597 --> 10:32.875
Your grades are good.

10:32.875 --> 10:34.396
This is just a matter of completing

10:34.396 --> 10:36.726
the required coursework to
move on to the next year.

10:36.726 --> 10:38.480
And I have to do that in summer school?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.097
You don't have to do a full day.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.696
And you really just have
to finish a class or two.

10:42.696 --> 10:44.385
Well, is it one class or two?

10:44.725 --> 10:45.664
It's three.

10:45.664 --> 10:47.306
- Three?
- I'm sorry.

10:47.306 --> 10:49.594
Your teachers understand your situation,

10:49.594 --> 10:50.753
but they can't let you slide

10:50.753 --> 10:53.139
because they understand your situation.

11:10.424 --> 11:11.976
- George?
- What? Yeah?

11:12.997 --> 11:14.064
How long you been there?

11:14.064 --> 11:15.681
About two seconds.

11:15.681 --> 11:17.992
Oh. I figured it was longer.

11:18.284 --> 11:19.296
What's that?

11:19.296 --> 11:20.648
Oh, nothing.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.511
Anne served me with divorce papers.

11:24.511 --> 11:25.720
I'm sorry?

11:25.720 --> 11:26.838
Is that a question?

11:26.838 --> 11:29.190
Well, the two of you are
living in two different homes,

11:29.190 --> 11:32.085
and she is seeing somebody else,

11:32.085 --> 11:34.176
and she is pregnant.

11:34.176 --> 11:35.471
Your point being?

11:36.075 --> 11:37.879
This can't be a surprise to you.

11:37.879 --> 11:41.385
In fact, I'm actually surprised
that the divorce isn't final already.

11:41.385 --> 11:43.028
Yeah, it's been moving
slowly for a while,

11:43.028 --> 11:45.007
but this really picked up the pace.

11:45.007 --> 11:47.704
But this is so fast and so final.

11:47.704 --> 11:49.342
Divorce usually is.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.463
I'm not sure I want it to be final.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.518
I was hoping she hadn't
put that ring he gave her on

11:54.518 --> 11:56.630
because she wasn't sure.

11:57.692 --> 11:58.788
She's sure now.

11:58.788 --> 12:01.117
She is having his baby.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.085
Yeah.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.955
She is, isn't she?

12:07.271 --> 12:08.456
George.

12:08.456 --> 12:10.576
What? I don't know.

12:10.576 --> 12:12.103
What does that mean?

12:13.292 --> 12:14.888
I lied.

12:23.663 --> 12:25.186
Hey, hey. I was looking for you.

12:25.186 --> 12:26.715
I wanted to make plans for tonight,

12:26.715 --> 12:27.883
and I have so much to tell you,

12:27.883 --> 12:29.535
and it's my last night here, you know?

12:29.535 --> 12:30.670
Yeah, I know.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.382
So you want to just say good-bye now?

12:32.382 --> 12:35.455
Uh, Amy, I-- I wanted to
take you out somewhere.

12:35.491 --> 12:36.911
I don't feel like it.

12:37.317 --> 12:39.266
Well, then, I--
can I come over?

12:39.266 --> 12:40.328
It's okay.

12:40.795 --> 12:42.696
Please don't make me
feel guilty for going.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.491
You don't have to feel guilty.
I couldn't go even if I could.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.121
I have summer school because of John.

12:49.767 --> 12:50.905
Because of Ricky.

12:52.054 --> 12:53.393
Okay, because of me.

12:53.393 --> 12:55.212
I have incompletes in half my classes,

12:55.212 --> 12:58.086
so you're off the hook for never wanting
me to go with you in the first place.

12:58.086 --> 12:59.214
So go, Ben.

12:59.214 --> 13:00.816
Go and have your fun while I stay here

13:00.816 --> 13:02.715
and have the worst summer
anyone has ever had.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.154
Let me come by tonight.

13:04.154 --> 13:06.459
I'm going to be gone
for almost three months,

13:06.459 --> 13:07.642
and I'm really going to miss you.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.158
I'm going to miss you, too,

13:09.158 --> 13:11.784
but I don't want to make too
much of a big deal out of this,

13:11.784 --> 13:13.330
so let's just say good-bye now.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.495
Good-bye, Ben. 
Have a nice trip.

13:15.845 --> 13:17.279
I can't just leave it like that.

13:17.279 --> 13:19.512
I can't just leave with
a "Have a nice trip."

13:19.727 --> 13:22.223
I'm sorry, Ben, but
it's all I can give you.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.758
I know you deserve more.

13:27.002 --> 13:28.156
I know I deserve more,

13:28.156 --> 13:30.942
but right now that's the best I can do.

13:36.344 --> 13:37.169
See ya.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.549
I don't want you to
remember me like this.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.039
I don't want you to show it
to people in Italy and say,

13:48.039 --> 13:50.415
"That's my girlfriend,
the pregnant girl"!

13:58.047 --> 13:59.879
- Hey.
- What do you want?

14:00.115 --> 14:01.933
- What? 
-What do you want?

14:01.933 --> 14:03.438
Tonight is my first
night in my apartment

14:03.438 --> 14:05.382
and I want to have John stay with me.

14:05.382 --> 14:06.822
Oh, is this something
you and Ben cooked up

14:06.822 --> 14:08.256
so we could have our big good-bye date?

14:08.256 --> 14:10.146
Because it's not happening.
We just said good-bye.

14:10.146 --> 14:12.044
No, it's not something
Ben and I cooked up.

14:12.044 --> 14:13.280
I just want to have my son with me

14:13.280 --> 14:15.254
when I spend my first
night in my apartment.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.544
It's a big deal for me.

14:16.544 --> 14:17.926
It's a big step I'm making,

14:17.926 --> 14:19.175
and I'm making it because of John.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.295
So I thought it'd be
nice to have him there.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.255
It's always about you, isn't it?

14:23.483 --> 14:26.103
No, it's not. What's with you?

14:26.694 --> 14:28.143
I can't go anywhere

14:28.143 --> 14:29.986
or do anything anyone else is doing

14:29.986 --> 14:32.481
because I have a baby, our baby.

14:32.481 --> 14:34.289
And I have summer school and work,

14:34.289 --> 14:36.617
and my boyfriend is going
to Italy for the summer,

14:36.617 --> 14:38.451
and-- and my parents
are getting divorced,

14:38.451 --> 14:40.374
and my mother is having a baby.

14:40.374 --> 14:43.583
- That's what's wrong with me.
- Oh. Sorry.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.406
But I think your mom's happy
about the baby and the divorce.

14:46.406 --> 14:48.365
And she's with a really nice guy.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.022
And who cares if Ben's going to Italy.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.119
He'll be back.

14:51.119 --> 14:52.717
And maybe he'll grow up a little.

14:52.978 --> 14:55.029
But he's not going to have sex,
so don't even worry about it.

14:55.029 --> 14:56.421
You know he loves you.

14:56.421 --> 14:58.176
And you're lucky to have a job,

14:58.176 --> 15:00.055
and you're lucky you're only
having to go to summer school

15:00.055 --> 15:03.151
and you didn't drop out
or lose a year of school.

15:03.754 --> 15:06.927
And did you mention
the yearbook picture?

15:09.762 --> 15:12.473
Lighten up, will ya? School is out.

15:12.473 --> 15:13.931
Come on, let me take John tonight.

15:13.931 --> 15:15.740
I baby-proofed the whole place.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.404
I've got a crib, I've got everything.

15:17.704 --> 15:18.436
Please?

15:19.367 --> 15:21.500
-All right. 
-Thanks.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.820
I'll come by after I
get cleaned up from work.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.420
I heard about Amy
going to summer school.

15:29.871 --> 15:31.556
She has to go to summer school, right?

15:31.855 --> 15:33.307
That's already all over school?

15:33.848 --> 15:36.244
I can't discussed another
student's work, but--

15:36.244 --> 15:37.902
I mean, I know I missed
a week when my dad died,

15:37.902 --> 15:40.448
but I didn't think I fell
that far behind, did I?

15:40.690 --> 15:41.968
No, not at all.

15:41.968 --> 15:43.471
You don't have to do summer school.

15:43.931 --> 15:45.678
If this is about my
quitting cheerleading--

15:45.678 --> 15:46.999
You're quitting cheerleading?

15:46.999 --> 15:48.503
That's not what this is about?

15:48.503 --> 15:49.319
No.

15:50.503 --> 15:53.322
Yeah, I am quitting.
 I'm in mourning.

15:53.322 --> 15:55.697
It's kind of hard to be cheerful
when you're in mourning.

15:55.697 --> 15:56.722
I understand.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.330
Losing a parent is...

16:00.221 --> 16:01.737
I don't know what it's like.

16:01.737 --> 16:03.427
I still have both my parents.

16:03.427 --> 16:05.771
Then I guess you can't be
in our dead parents club.

16:06.982 --> 16:08.251
It's Jack's idea.

16:08.251 --> 16:09.119
All right, well,

16:09.119 --> 16:10.968
I actually have some good news for you.

16:10.968 --> 16:14.440
You've been accepted into the Young
Healers summer training program.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.799
Young Healers? I don't
know what that is.

16:16.799 --> 16:20.311
The immersive pre-pre-med
training program.

16:20.311 --> 16:21.607
You applied for it.

16:21.607 --> 16:22.662
No, I didn't.

16:22.662 --> 16:23.742
You got in.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.230
Oh. My dad.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.368
I remember him mentioning
something about it.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.681
He probably put in an application for me

16:32.681 --> 16:34.599
because I wanted to go
to cheerleading camp.

16:34.599 --> 16:36.816
But now you're not going
to cheerleading camp.

16:36.816 --> 16:39.505
No. And I'm not going
to medical camp, either.

16:39.505 --> 16:42.120
I don't want to go anywhere
or do anything this summer.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.784
It's an incredible opportunity.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.592
If you change your mind,
you'll be living, studying,

16:47.592 --> 16:50.018
and working with
doctors and med students

16:50.018 --> 16:51.810
at an actual teaching hospital.

16:51.810 --> 16:55.170
It's for students who have shown a
desire to pursue a career in medicine

16:55.170 --> 16:58.636
so that they enter college with the
strongest medical background possible.

16:58.636 --> 16:59.812
And I got in?

17:00.274 --> 17:01.373
You got in.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.347
You and one other student.

17:04.347 --> 17:06.683
Jason Treacy. Lauren's brother.

17:06.683 --> 17:10.171
Yeah, well, that's-- that's
good, I guess, for him.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.739
I understand with
everything that's happened

17:12.739 --> 17:14.459
this would be too much for you.

17:15.051 --> 17:16.251
It's a tough program.

17:18.165 --> 17:19.394
Just think about it.

17:19.394 --> 17:20.371
Thanks.

17:22.950 --> 17:25.945
I don't think I'll do it, but thanks.

17:32.830 --> 17:33.818
Hey, Grace.

17:34.046 --> 17:36.570
I heard we're both going off
to be doctors this summer.

17:37.001 --> 17:38.410
Oh, I don't know, Jason.

17:38.410 --> 17:39.824
I don't think I can.

17:41.957 --> 17:43.087
Well, uh...

17:43.087 --> 17:45.656
hopefully they'll offer it
to you again next summer.

17:46.391 --> 17:49.031
But Grace, I don't think they do that.

17:49.447 --> 17:50.641
This program's really hard to get into.

17:50.641 --> 17:54.240
It's kind of a once in a
high-school lifetime opportunity.

17:54.813 --> 17:55.554
I know.

17:56.405 --> 17:58.705
I'll look forward to hearing
all about it from you.

17:59.366 --> 18:00.697
Have a great summer, Jason.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.153
Are they here yet?

18:18.153 --> 18:20.097
They just pulled into the parking lot.

18:20.097 --> 18:23.075
What kind of client shows
up hours late for a meeting?

18:23.075 --> 18:25.350
Really special clients.

18:25.350 --> 18:26.774
Well, they better be.

18:26.774 --> 18:28.776
I could have used two
more hours of sleep.

18:29.563 --> 18:30.671
Hello!

18:32.108 --> 18:35.472
Hi. I'm Anne Juergens.
I guess you know David.

18:35.472 --> 18:38.334
Hello, sweetie. Oh!

18:40.423 --> 18:41.857
And I guess we do know David.

18:41.857 --> 18:43.713
- Don't we, Randall?
- Yes, we do. Yes.

18:43.713 --> 18:44.969
Nice to meet you.

18:45.765 --> 18:47.304
Nice to meet you, too.

18:48.837 --> 18:49.857
You didn't tell her?

18:49.857 --> 18:52.040
No. I didn't want her to run away.

18:54.005 --> 18:55.201
Didn't tell me what?

18:56.200 --> 19:00.379
Anne, it's my pleasure to
introduce you to my parents.

19:00.785 --> 19:03.215
This is Randall and Eunice Johnson.

19:03.678 --> 19:05.263
David has told us so much about you.

19:05.263 --> 19:08.641
It's so very nice to meet you.

19:08.641 --> 19:10.168
So very, very nice.

19:10.168 --> 19:13.560
Well, it's a very nice
surprise to meet you, too.

19:14.204 --> 19:15.151
Although, I don't know why

19:15.151 --> 19:17.936
anyone would want to surprise me, David.

19:46.971 --> 19:48.663
Getting all packed for summer vacation?

19:49.106 --> 19:50.085
Hi, Ben.

19:50.085 --> 19:51.998
Actually, no.

19:51.998 --> 19:54.077
Getting packed for the rest of my life.

19:55.891 --> 19:57.287
I won't be working here next year.

19:57.287 --> 19:58.423
On what grounds?

19:58.423 --> 19:59.593
They have no reason to let you go.

19:59.593 --> 20:02.177
I mean, sure, you got too involved in
your students' personal lives, but--

20:02.177 --> 20:04.825
But I'm leaving on my own.

20:07.201 --> 20:08.449
I just had a baby.

20:09.304 --> 20:12.056
This job doesn't pay enough
to support a growing family.

20:12.307 --> 20:15.199
Not to mention a growing
family's mother-in-law.

20:15.835 --> 20:17.344
Being a parent isn't easy.

20:18.187 --> 20:19.486
Yeah, tell me about it.

20:20.809 --> 20:21.747
I don't know what to say.

20:21.747 --> 20:24.766
I mean, I don't know
what I'm going to do.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.381
You've helped me through so much.

20:26.381 --> 20:28.335
I don't know how much I actually helped.

20:28.335 --> 20:29.735
No. I mean, really, everything.

20:29.735 --> 20:33.799
Amy, the baby, Amy.

20:35.343 --> 20:37.047
I wouldn't have Amy
if it weren't for you.

20:37.047 --> 20:38.777
I can't do anything about
the summer school, Ben.

20:38.777 --> 20:40.418
No. Really, that's not why I was here.

20:40.418 --> 20:42.067
I just came by to say thank you.

20:42.858 --> 20:45.182
Didn't know I was going to have
to say thank you and good-bye.

20:45.395 --> 20:46.293
You're welcome.

20:47.262 --> 20:48.278
And thank you.

20:48.925 --> 20:49.732
For?

20:50.376 --> 20:52.172
An interesting year.

20:54.584 --> 20:55.636
Hey, uh...

20:56.560 --> 20:57.601
while you're still here,

20:57.601 --> 21:00.290
do you mind if I ask for
one more piece of advice?

21:00.718 --> 21:01.523
Shoot.

21:01.845 --> 21:05.930
Should I tell my father that
he's engaged to a prostitute?

21:25.340 --> 21:27.394
I like it a lot.

21:27.394 --> 21:28.713
How'd you get in here?

21:29.583 --> 21:32.892
Well, after being threatened by
some woman with a meat cleaver,

21:32.892 --> 21:35.282
a guy in the back, Danny, let me in.

21:35.282 --> 21:37.682
I have to get to work. 
I don't have time to play.

21:37.682 --> 21:38.530
Fine.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.339
Why don't you get to work.

21:40.628 --> 21:42.417
And then, when you're
all finished with work,

21:42.702 --> 21:44.337
I'll be here waiting for you.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.363
That sounds like a very
attractive proposition,

21:46.363 --> 21:47.515
but I can't.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.887
Wait. What do you mean you can't?

21:48.887 --> 21:49.959
I can't.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.448
After work, I'm picking John up.

21:51.448 --> 21:53.382
He's going to spend
the night here with me.

21:55.103 --> 21:57.360
Wait. John's going to be sleeping here?

21:58.119 --> 22:01.190
He's going to be the one you choose
to be with your first night here?

22:01.879 --> 22:03.085
Amy agreed to it.

22:05.393 --> 22:07.417
So that's what you meant
when you said, "We'll see."

22:07.417 --> 22:09.242
Yeah, and that's why I have a crib

22:09.242 --> 22:11.898
and diapers and bottles and
everything else he needs,

22:11.898 --> 22:14.481
because he's my son and I'm his father.

22:14.969 --> 22:18.064
I have to get to work and
you have to get off of my bed.

22:18.864 --> 22:20.937
I liked having sex in my bed.

22:20.937 --> 22:21.828
That's over, Adrian.

22:21.828 --> 22:23.301
I can't come over there anymore.

22:23.401 --> 22:26.900
I'm either going to be over
at Amy's or here or downstairs.

22:27.268 --> 22:28.644
That's my life now.

22:28.644 --> 22:31.130
You don't want me to be
with anyone else, right?

22:31.543 --> 22:32.449
I guess.

22:32.449 --> 22:35.722
You said you didn't want
me to be with Ben or Jack.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.658
Did I?

22:36.658 --> 22:38.929
Yeah, you did.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.362
And I don't want you
to be with anyone else.

22:42.882 --> 22:44.530
I don't want you lying to me,

22:44.530 --> 22:46.897
telling me that you're over at
Amy's or that John's over here

22:46.897 --> 22:48.818
when you're really
with some other woman.

22:48.818 --> 22:51.258
I guess you're just
going to have to trust me.

23:04.654 --> 23:06.017
More of Dad's things?

23:06.017 --> 23:06.904
Yeah.

23:07.236 --> 23:09.689
The church was gathering some
donations for the homeless.

23:09.689 --> 23:10.906
Did you know about this?

23:12.081 --> 23:13.201
Did you get accepted?

23:13.201 --> 23:14.440
Yeah, I did.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.392
Yeah. Your dad told me.
He was applying for you.

23:17.392 --> 23:18.632
You don't have to go,

23:18.632 --> 23:20.537
but I know he'd be proud you got in.

23:20.537 --> 23:22.356
I can't just go and leave you and Tom.

23:22.356 --> 23:23.748
Honey, we'd be okay.

23:24.667 --> 23:27.202
You know we'd be okay,
Grace, if you want to go.

23:27.595 --> 23:30.043
We would miss you, but we'd be okay.

23:31.002 --> 23:32.746
Why is this so easy for you?

23:32.746 --> 23:35.418
How can you just pack up his
things and leave them on the curb?

23:35.418 --> 23:37.411
It's too soon, Mom. It's not right.

23:37.411 --> 23:39.654
I'm not just leaving your
dad's things on the curb.

23:39.654 --> 23:42.246
I'm just doing what he would
do if he were still here.

23:42.766 --> 23:44.438
I'm donating clothes he didn't wear.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.840
Okay, and maybe some that he did wear,

23:48.840 --> 23:51.912
but someone could wear these clothes.

23:55.394 --> 23:59.767
Grace, your father
was such a giving man.

24:00.366 --> 24:02.998
All he ever thought
about was helping others.

24:02.998 --> 24:04.439
And he would be so pleased to know

24:04.439 --> 24:06.312
that you were thinking
of going into medicine.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.079
Not that you have to go to
that program this summer.

24:09.079 --> 24:11.199
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.017
You are so much like your father.

24:13.017 --> 24:14.963
No matter what you choose
to do with your life,

24:14.963 --> 24:16.678
you'll end up making
the world a better place,

24:16.678 --> 24:19.877
whether that's in
medicine or some other way.

24:19.877 --> 24:22.268
So do what's right for you this summer.

24:22.268 --> 24:24.613
Go there, stay here,
go to cheerleading camp,

24:24.613 --> 24:26.156
whatever you want.

24:27.797 --> 24:30.853
But live your life,
Grace. Live your life.

24:31.515 --> 24:33.749
Because that's all any of us can do...

24:35.769 --> 24:36.996
is go on living.

24:39.630 --> 24:40.626
Okay.

24:50.544 --> 24:53.564
- Trouble in River City.
- What?

24:53.564 --> 24:54.817
When I was taking the garbage out,

24:54.817 --> 24:56.115
I saw Adrian parked on the street,

24:56.115 --> 24:57.561
and she's headed this way.

24:59.302 --> 25:00.993
So don't say I didn't warn you.

25:08.102 --> 25:10.090
I called to you. You didn't hear me?

25:10.910 --> 25:11.761
Uh, what?

25:11.761 --> 25:12.939
Look, I would have
knocked on the front door,

25:12.939 --> 25:15.220
but I saw you going
up the driveway and--

25:15.220 --> 25:16.543
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

25:16.543 --> 25:19.645
I...have an ear infection.

25:23.357 --> 25:24.599
That's my dad.

25:24.599 --> 25:26.534
Did you want to speak with him.

25:32.291 --> 25:33.277
Hi, George.

25:33.675 --> 25:35.020
Long time, no see.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.764
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

25:36.764 --> 25:39.745
I like this neck of the
woods, whatever that means.

25:39.745 --> 25:41.177
Spying on Ricky. Is that it?

25:41.177 --> 25:43.103
No, I'm not spying on Ricky.

25:43.103 --> 25:45.296
Ricky's at work. He's
at the butcher shop.

25:45.296 --> 25:48.000
Oh, and he just got an
apartment over the butcher shop.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.255
Yeah, I heard about that.

25:49.255 --> 25:50.792
Bad news for both of us, huh?

25:50.792 --> 25:52.983
- How so?
- Too much privacy.

25:52.983 --> 25:55.591
Speaking of which, are
you selling your house?

25:56.283 --> 25:58.063
Are you moving back in with your wife?

25:58.063 --> 26:00.653
-Why would you-- Where would you--
- I heard she's with child.

26:01.377 --> 26:02.692
Everyone's heard she's with child.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.164
- So?
- So...

26:04.164 --> 26:05.016
I heard it's your child.

26:05.016 --> 26:06.375
Where would you hear
something like that?

26:06.375 --> 26:07.591
It's the word on the street.

26:07.591 --> 26:08.719
You're hanging out on the wrong street.

26:08.719 --> 26:11.439
I got my pipes replumbed.
The kid's not mine.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.158
And why would I move in
with my soon-to-be ex-wife

26:13.158 --> 26:14.320
to raise another man's baby?

26:14.320 --> 26:16.015
Because you're lying about that,

26:16.015 --> 26:17.318
about your pipes.

26:17.318 --> 26:18.798
It's your baby.

26:20.009 --> 26:20.869
Grace?

26:22.832 --> 26:23.799
Look, don't blame her.

26:23.799 --> 26:24.753
She just lost her father.

26:24.753 --> 26:26.448
She can't keep a secret like that.

26:26.448 --> 26:28.146
- Not right now, anyway.
-I know, I know.

26:28.146 --> 26:31.586
But that's no reason the two of us
should be talking about my inner workings.

26:32.862 --> 26:34.297
All right, here's the deal.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.737
My parents are kind of
getting back together.

26:36.737 --> 26:37.643
They're not getting married,

26:37.643 --> 26:39.766
but they want to live
together like they are married.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.856
- Really?
-Yeah.

26:40.856 --> 26:41.811
You heard about that, right?

26:41.811 --> 26:43.172
No, I didn't hear about that.

26:43.172 --> 26:44.788
Oh. Yeah. So forget about my mom.

26:45.347 --> 26:47.300
All right. And sell us your house.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.584
The condo is way too small
for the two of them and me.

26:49.584 --> 26:50.775
And Ricky?

26:51.930 --> 26:53.334
Ricky. Ugh.

26:54.331 --> 26:55.911
Hey, I don't know what
you've got against Ricky,

26:55.911 --> 26:58.103
cause *** now.

27:06.715 --> 27:07.750
She's right.

27:08.298 --> 27:10.446
You are Ricky, and it's gone too far.

27:10.446 --> 27:11.837
You know, you have to tell Mom.

27:12.273 --> 27:13.426
I don't know if there's
anything to tell her.

27:13.426 --> 27:14.715
We really can't be sure about anything.

27:14.715 --> 27:17.794
Then tell her that, because right
now she's sure you cut your pipes.

27:17.794 --> 27:19.034
I know, I know.

27:19.034 --> 27:21.228
Eventually, Amy's going to
know I'm covering for you.

27:21.228 --> 27:23.533
I'm lying, Dad. I hate lying.

27:23.533 --> 27:26.774
You wouldn't believe the stories I've had
to spin to keep your little secret a secret.

27:26.774 --> 27:27.989
And I thank you for that.

27:27.989 --> 27:29.029
Oh, don't thank me.

27:29.029 --> 27:30.749
I wasn't doing it to
make your life easier.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.862
I was doing it so you could figure
out whatever you need to figure out,

27:32.862 --> 27:34.501
and then let Mom know what's going on.

27:34.501 --> 27:35.821
So let her know what's going on.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.318
It's time to come clean and be a man,

27:37.318 --> 27:38.960
because if you won't be a man, I will.

27:38.960 --> 27:39.680
I'm going to be a man.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.672
I just...have to figure out when.

27:43.447 --> 27:44.438
What's gotten into you?

27:45.043 --> 27:47.494
What's gotten into you? Divorce, Dad?

27:49.878 --> 27:54.206
Look, I get the whole being separated
and living next door thing, I really do.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.201
I mean, this has been an
adventure for both of us,

27:56.201 --> 27:58.904
but, God, a divorce when
you know it's your baby?

27:58.904 --> 28:01.864
- I don't know. Not for sure.
- Yes, you do.

28:01.864 --> 28:03.944
And a divorce is officially
sending Mom on her way

28:03.944 --> 28:05.065
and pushing her to another man

28:05.065 --> 28:06.457
she might not want to be pushed to

28:06.457 --> 28:08.832
if she just had that one very
important piece of information

28:08.832 --> 28:12.336
that the baby is, or could
be, or is most likely yours!

28:17.580 --> 28:18.359
Dad...

28:20.076 --> 28:22.907
I know I'm all over the
place and mixing metaphors,

28:22.907 --> 28:24.995
but I'm angry.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.979
I mean, she's still my mother.

28:26.979 --> 28:33.843
And while I enjoy playing with the emotions
of really emotional people like her and Amy...

28:35.667 --> 28:38.073
I don't want to see
Mom actually get hurt.

28:38.738 --> 28:39.978
Please tell her.

28:42.907 --> 28:43.730
Please.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.961
Almost ready to go?

28:51.672 --> 28:52.712
I'm not going anywhere.

28:52.712 --> 28:55.231
I mean, I'm not going
over to Amy's, anyway.

28:55.456 --> 28:57.249
We said good-bye today at school.

28:58.496 --> 28:59.575
That's how she wanted it.

28:59.575 --> 29:00.695
Well, that's too bad.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.231
I mean, I know you're
going to miss Amy and John.

29:03.231 --> 29:04.152
Yeah.

29:04.891 --> 29:06.199
I'm going to miss you, too.

29:06.393 --> 29:07.199
I'll miss you,

29:07.199 --> 29:08.845
but it's only for a few months.

29:08.845 --> 29:11.989
And you'll have Betty here
to keep you company, so.

29:13.729 --> 29:15.325
You really love her, don't you?

29:15.773 --> 29:16.589
Of course I do.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.359
Otherwise, I wouldn't be marrying her.

29:19.302 --> 29:20.919
Well, I guess I'll
see you in the morning.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.512
Wait, Dad.

29:25.365 --> 29:26.793
Betty's a prostitute.

29:26.793 --> 29:27.937
No, she's not.

29:27.937 --> 29:28.684
She is, Dad.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.092
I know you don't want to hear it.

29:30.092 --> 29:31.728
I don't even want to
say it, but it's true.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.046
Betty is a hooker.

29:33.046 --> 29:34.247
No, she's not.

29:34.247 --> 29:36.105
- Dad--
- She's not a hooker.

29:36.105 --> 29:39.056
She's not a prostitute.
She's just Betty.

29:39.056 --> 29:41.143
She used to be a
hooker, or a prostitute,

29:41.143 --> 29:42.383
or whatever it is you want to call her,

29:42.383 --> 29:43.935
but she's not anymore.

29:43.935 --> 29:45.431
She's just Betty.

29:45.431 --> 29:46.599
Wait. You knew?

29:46.599 --> 29:47.543
Yeah, I knew.

29:47.543 --> 29:49.415
She told me before we slept together.

29:49.415 --> 29:51.312
She's been honest with me all along,

29:51.312 --> 29:53.151
and that hasn't been easy for her.

29:53.151 --> 29:55.839
She tried to tell you, but she
couldn't find a way to say it.

29:55.839 --> 29:58.662
So you're not worried
that she may be just--

29:58.662 --> 29:59.951
After my money?

30:00.336 --> 30:01.503
I don't think so.

30:01.503 --> 30:03.137
That's not who she is.

30:03.137 --> 30:06.120
And I know the whole
"hooker with a heart of gold"

30:06.120 --> 30:08.218
is kind of a cliché in the movies,

30:08.218 --> 30:09.837
but this is my life.

30:09.837 --> 30:12.421
And what can I say? I really love her.

30:12.421 --> 30:13.885
And let me tell you something, Ben.

30:13.885 --> 30:14.996
I loved your mother.

30:14.996 --> 30:16.566
I knew her most of my life,

30:16.566 --> 30:18.302
and I loved her most of my life.

30:18.302 --> 30:21.119
And I'm going to love her
for the rest of my life.

30:21.664 --> 30:26.199
But loving someone who isn't
around anymore is very painful.

30:27.305 --> 30:28.978
And Betty makes me happy.

30:28.978 --> 30:33.352
I've smiled more since I met her than I
have in all the years since your mom died.

30:33.745 --> 30:35.136
It still hurts,

30:35.136 --> 30:39.186
but it hurts a little
less because of Betty.

30:39.186 --> 30:41.080
- And her past--
- Is her past.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.602
She put it behind her.
I put it behind me.

30:43.602 --> 30:45.418
And I hope you could do the same.

30:45.418 --> 30:46.850
People know, you know?

30:46.850 --> 30:50.706
Yeah, well, I don't let people
make my decisions for me.

30:51.042 --> 30:53.377
Never have, never will.

30:53.377 --> 30:55.208
And don't worry about Amy.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.984
It'll all work out.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.234
Yeah, maybe.

30:59.933 --> 31:00.799
Good night.

31:00.799 --> 31:01.879
Good night, Dad.

31:04.346 --> 31:05.614
I love you, son.

31:06.183 --> 31:08.975
And, uh, thanks for letting
me know what I already knew.

31:10.059 --> 31:12.391
Any time. I love you, too.

31:19.841 --> 31:20.638
Sorry.

31:21.397 --> 31:22.837
I thought you were
flying for a few days.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.245
I caught the deadhead flight.

31:24.562 --> 31:28.211
And I figured I'd have rather spend my
free time at home than in some hotel.

31:28.211 --> 31:30.948
And I, for one, think
you made the right choice.

31:31.476 --> 31:33.412
Okay, you two.

31:33.784 --> 31:34.866
Ricky's busy tonight,

31:34.866 --> 31:36.874
and I've got no place else to go.

31:36.874 --> 31:38.979
- And you're not--
- Busy with Ricky?

31:38.979 --> 31:40.515
He's got John over for the first time.

31:40.515 --> 31:42.666
It's his first night
in his new apartment.

31:42.666 --> 31:44.707
Aw, that's sweet.

31:44.707 --> 31:45.916
Well, sit down.

31:46.428 --> 31:47.645
Come have dinner with us.

31:47.645 --> 31:48.671
No, I don't think so.

31:48.671 --> 31:50.182
I'm just going to go to my room.

31:50.182 --> 31:51.198
No, you won't.

31:52.231 --> 31:53.250
Come have dinner with us.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.233
You hungry?

31:54.233 --> 31:55.696
Kind of.

31:56.012 --> 31:56.809
Sit down.

31:57.233 --> 31:59.220
Tell us how your last day of school was.

31:59.220 --> 32:01.339
Yeah. Tell us what plans
you have for the summer.

32:01.339 --> 32:03.163
I don't really
have any plans and--

32:03.163 --> 32:04.427
No, I can't sit down.

32:04.427 --> 32:05.810
This looks like a dinner
for the two of you.

32:05.810 --> 32:08.523
It's a dinner for the
three of us, right?

32:08.523 --> 32:09.162
Come on.

32:09.162 --> 32:10.052
Sit down. We're a family.

32:10.052 --> 32:10.844
Come on.

32:20.127 --> 32:21.052
What?

32:21.052 --> 32:25.548
Well, um, we just heard you
made an offer on a house.

32:26.427 --> 32:27.683
And?

32:27.683 --> 32:30.179
And...we'll see.

32:31.098 --> 32:32.539
Yeah, I get a lot of that.

32:33.315 --> 32:34.555
To the three of us.

32:36.074 --> 32:37.507
To the three of us.

32:38.936 --> 32:40.275
<i>Para mi familia.</i>

32:40.775 --> 32:41.866
<i>Gracias.</i>

32:58.934 --> 33:00.842
I tried to keep him
awake until you got here,

33:00.842 --> 33:02.835
but I couldn't.

33:03.954 --> 33:05.475
How long has he been down?

33:05.977 --> 33:07.274
About 15 minutes.

33:09.585 --> 33:10.449
Where's your mom?

33:10.449 --> 33:11.768
She drove up to see the house

33:11.768 --> 33:14.239
she and David are
renovating with his parents.

33:14.239 --> 33:15.935
-They're going to be late.
-All right.

33:16.533 --> 33:19.528
Well, I guess he can
sleep over another night.

33:19.528 --> 33:21.648
He'll probably wake up in an hour or two

33:21.648 --> 33:23.096
if you just want to wait.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.335
You look tired.

33:25.675 --> 33:26.688
Long day.

33:26.688 --> 33:27.472
Okay.

33:28.496 --> 33:30.630
Well, you should get some rest.

33:30.630 --> 33:34.063
I was going to, but if
you're not taking him...

33:34.063 --> 33:36.111
I don't want to wake him up, do I?

33:37.378 --> 33:38.086
No.

33:39.181 --> 33:41.174
It's probably not the best idea.

33:41.174 --> 33:43.439
I could sit in here and
wait for him to wake up

33:43.439 --> 33:45.095
while you sleep in his room.

33:45.445 --> 33:48.022
I don't mind watching him
so you can get some rest.

33:48.373 --> 33:49.120
Really?

33:50.141 --> 33:51.449
Ben's not coming over?

33:53.036 --> 33:53.960
Then go on.

33:53.960 --> 33:54.976
I got it.

33:55.408 --> 33:56.999
You go get some sleep.

33:57.723 --> 33:59.599
I am kind of tired.

33:59.599 --> 34:00.519
Yeah?

34:01.642 --> 34:03.199
Anything else going on?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.390
Everything else.

34:07.301 --> 34:10.485
Ben leaving for the summer
and my parents breaking up,

34:10.529 --> 34:11.907
summer school, work.

34:11.907 --> 34:13.748
Don't forget about the yearbook picture.

34:13.748 --> 34:14.533
Yeah.

34:15.991 --> 34:18.225
Even though I don't like
that picture of me, it's--

34:18.225 --> 34:20.760
it's kind of funny that
John got in the yearbook.

34:20.813 --> 34:21.728
Yeah.

34:23.309 --> 34:24.753
That's a good way to look at it.

34:25.219 --> 34:27.063
That's a good way to look at life.

34:28.281 --> 34:30.513
When everything else
is bad in our lives,

34:31.266 --> 34:33.063
at least we got him, huh?

34:42.138 --> 34:43.023
good night.

34:43.853 --> 34:47.130
Just *** wakes up.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.170
Hi. You made us coffee.

35:07.170 --> 35:09.085
I figured that was the least I could do

35:09.085 --> 35:11.129
for you and Dad driving
me to the airport.

35:14.485 --> 35:18.045
Uh, I-- I heard that
you heard that I'm--

35:18.045 --> 35:20.493
Not a court reporter?

35:20.493 --> 35:21.927
Yeah. Yeah.

35:21.927 --> 35:24.359
That's a nice way of putting it.

35:24.359 --> 35:26.607
I mean, you know, I'm a lot of things,

35:26.607 --> 35:28.247
or I was, but...

35:29.135 --> 35:31.135
Yeah, I'm not a court reporter.

35:31.135 --> 35:33.400
Listen, Betty. 
I think you're great.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.647
I really do.

35:34.647 --> 35:36.655
And if my dad is happy, then I'm happy.

35:36.655 --> 35:40.582
Yeah. He's happy.
 I think he's really happy.

35:40.617 --> 35:42.405
Happiest man on earth.

35:42.405 --> 35:43.513
Really? You mean that?

35:43.513 --> 35:44.624
I mean that.

35:45.352 --> 35:48.184
Maybe at the end of summer,
we'll fly over and pick you up.

35:48.336 --> 35:49.368
Really?

35:49.368 --> 35:50.439
I would like that.

35:50.731 --> 35:54.176
Ben, do you mind if I
give you some advice?

35:54.176 --> 35:55.532
About Bologna?

35:55.532 --> 35:56.783
No. No, no.

35:56.783 --> 35:59.174
That's-- That's your business.

35:59.174 --> 36:01.182
But, you know, whatever you do,

36:01.182 --> 36:06.464
just remember that being honest and sharing
your true feelings with the person you love

36:06.464 --> 36:09.091
is the most important thing you can do.

36:09.491 --> 36:11.555
You can't be dishonest
with the person you love

36:11.555 --> 36:15.082
and expect the other
person to honestly love you.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.860
I think what
she's saying is--

36:17.860 --> 36:20.691
That I need to stop on
the way to the airport?

36:31.628 --> 36:32.455
What's going on?

36:33.704 --> 36:35.315
When I said we'd talk
first thing in the morning,

36:35.315 --> 36:37.926
I meant after I had a
shower and had breakfast.

36:37.926 --> 36:39.686
You're not breaking up with me?

36:39.686 --> 36:42.637
No. Jack, no. I love you.

36:42.637 --> 36:43.933
Oh, thank you.

36:44.945 --> 36:46.523
I know I can be an idiot sometimes,

36:46.523 --> 36:48.898
but I love you, too.

36:49.563 --> 36:50.709
And you know, football camp,

36:50.709 --> 36:52.037
it's right here.

36:52.881 --> 36:54.492
Well, not right here, but near here.

36:54.492 --> 36:56.283
And I can come see you every night.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.323
I will come see you
every night, I promise.

36:58.323 --> 37:00.259
Jack, I'm not going to be here.

37:00.934 --> 37:02.528
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

37:02.528 --> 37:06.110
I'm going away to this
program for future doctors.

37:06.281 --> 37:07.727
My dad sent in an application,

37:07.727 --> 37:10.023
and I decided to go.

37:10.023 --> 37:13.015
So you're not going
to cheerleading camp?

37:13.015 --> 37:15.526
Well, let me see. What's
better for my future?

37:15.526 --> 37:17.933
Cheerleading camp or a medical program?

37:19.885 --> 37:22.420
I'm going to go with
the medical program.

37:23.060 --> 37:27.280
It's the extensive medical training
program for high school honor students.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.915
I was really lucky to be chosen.

37:28.915 --> 37:31.730
Wow. Congratulations.

37:33.070 --> 37:35.225
"Extensive" means
you'll be gone how long?

37:35.685 --> 37:37.504
Pretty much the whole summer.

37:39.945 --> 37:41.104
And when do you leave?

37:41.437 --> 37:42.223
Monday.

37:43.408 --> 37:44.985
So all we've got is this weekend.

37:46.251 --> 37:47.142
No, this is the weekend,

37:47.142 --> 37:49.217
so we've got today and tomorrow?

37:49.797 --> 37:51.372
Well, we have part of today

37:51.372 --> 37:54.013
because I have to run
some errands and pack.

37:54.013 --> 37:55.780
And then tomorrow I have church,

37:55.780 --> 37:58.796
and I want to spend some
time with my mom and Tom, too.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.195
- What?
- What?

38:02.195 --> 38:03.123
That.

38:03.798 --> 38:05.546
You're beautiful.
Your smile--

38:05.971 --> 38:08.178
That's the first time
I've seen your smile

38:08.178 --> 38:09.316
in a long time.

38:09.316 --> 38:10.516
I can't help it.

38:10.516 --> 38:13.171
I just feel like my dad
wanted this program for me

38:13.171 --> 38:14.980
before I even knew that I wanted it.

38:14.980 --> 38:18.523
I feel like he's looking
over me or something.

38:21.894 --> 38:23.051
I'm going to miss you, Grace.

38:23.743 --> 38:25.419
I'm going to miss you, too.

38:26.102 --> 38:29.026
But the good thing is we'll see
each other at the end of the summer.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.699
Wake up, sleepy-head.

38:38.041 --> 38:39.441
It's still dark out.

38:39.441 --> 38:41.657
- What time is it?
-  Time to get on the road.

38:42.349 --> 38:43.376
What do you mean?

38:43.376 --> 38:45.345
You remember how we
talked about buying an RV

38:45.345 --> 38:47.128
and hitting the road
and seeing the world?

38:47.128 --> 38:49.106
-We talk about a lotof things.
- Yeah, sure.

38:49.106 --> 38:50.754
But do you remember
that one in particular?

38:50.754 --> 38:52.268
Ugh, you didn't buy an RV, did you?

38:52.268 --> 38:54.279
No, of course not. I rented one.

38:54.279 --> 38:55.911
We can pick it up this morning.

38:56.207 --> 38:58.142
You can't see the world from an RV, Dad.

38:58.142 --> 38:58.960
Not from here.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.874
I mean, the continental
United States, sure.

39:01.874 --> 39:02.749
But the world?

39:02.749 --> 39:04.740
The RV can take us to any
airport in the country.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.628
And from there, the world is ours.

39:06.628 --> 39:07.639
You start high school next year.

39:07.639 --> 39:10.183
And after that, I figure you won't want
to spend any time with your old man.

39:10.183 --> 39:12.688
What makes you think I want to
spend time with my old man now?

39:12.688 --> 39:14.146
That's very funny. Pack your bags.

39:14.146 --> 39:15.315
We leave in one hour.

39:16.317 --> 39:18.619
We're just going to take off
and leave Amy and John behind?

39:18.619 --> 39:20.666
We'll set up webcams so we can see them

39:20.666 --> 39:22.235
and talk to them both
every night from the road.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.540
Who knows if we'll be gone
three days or three weeks or--

39:24.540 --> 39:26.690
Oh, we are not going to
be gone for three months.

39:26.690 --> 39:28.619
Fine. But however long we're gone,

39:28.619 --> 39:30.130
we don't want John
to forget what Grandpa

39:30.130 --> 39:31.738
and Auntie Ashley look like.

39:31.738 --> 39:32.588
And we don't have to worry about Amy.

39:32.588 --> 39:33.764
She's going to be fine.

39:33.764 --> 39:34.812
She might not always look like it,

39:34.812 --> 39:37.068
but she's becoming a great mother.

39:37.068 --> 39:39.403
-What about Mom?
-What do you mean?

39:39.403 --> 39:41.316
-Did you tell her?
-About the trip?

39:41.316 --> 39:42.908
No. About the...

39:44.167 --> 39:46.995
No. But I'm going to--

39:50.407 --> 39:51.339
Right now.

40:00.126 --> 40:01.098
Oh, the key.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.396
I keep forgetting to get that back.

40:02.396 --> 40:03.405
We need to talk.

40:03.836 --> 40:04.541
About?

40:05.004 --> 40:06.508
Look, George, I know you got the papers,

40:06.508 --> 40:08.075
and you called me and
told me to come over here.

40:08.075 --> 40:10.042
Yeah, that was a nice bit of
recon work by your lawyers.

40:10.042 --> 40:12.178
Look, you can have your lawyer
look them over if you want,

40:12.178 --> 40:13.515
but time is of the essence.

40:13.515 --> 40:15.002
What does that mean?

40:15.002 --> 40:16.890
I'm accepting David's proposal.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.341
And yet, you're not wearing his ring.

40:19.341 --> 40:21.423
No, I'm not. I'm waiting
for you to sign the papers,

40:21.423 --> 40:22.774
and then we're going to get married.

40:22.774 --> 40:24.767
All right, well, before you do that,

40:24.767 --> 40:27.559
- I have something I need to tell you.
- I'm marrying David.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.253
But you might change your
mind when you hear this.

40:29.253 --> 40:30.095
I'm not going to change my mind.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.878
-I'm marrying David.
-Okay, listen, Anne--

40:31.878 --> 40:33.760
I'm marrying David!

40:33.760 --> 40:36.063
Just sign the papers, George.

40:36.830 --> 40:37.658
Please.

40:40.366 --> 40:41.170
You got a pen?

40:44.748 --> 40:45.720
I'll get a pen.

41:00.285 --> 41:01.656
What are you doing here?

41:02.084 --> 41:04.231
Shouldn't you be at the airport already?

41:04.231 --> 41:06.295
I just couldn't leave
things like we left them.

41:06.787 --> 41:08.687
Listen, Amy, I don't
want to head off to Italy

41:08.687 --> 41:10.955
if you're not going to be
here for me when I get back.

41:10.955 --> 41:11.869
I love you.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.669
Ben, of course I'm
going to be here for you.

41:13.669 --> 41:15.036
I love you, too.

41:15.452 --> 41:17.980
After yesterday, I--
I really wasn't sure.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.388
I'm so tired all the time

41:19.388 --> 41:22.555
that I hardly even know what I'm doing.

41:23.683 --> 41:25.698
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

41:26.316 --> 41:27.147
It's okay.

41:30.374 --> 41:32.714
I just don't want anything
to ever come between us.

41:33.434 --> 41:37.721
Hey, enough has happened to
us that hasn't come between us

41:37.721 --> 41:40.240
that anything else
that gets thrown at us,

41:40.240 --> 41:42.552
it'll be a piece of cake to deal with.

41:43.193 --> 41:44.073
I love you.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.681
I love you, too.

41:49.844 --> 41:52.008
Some little boy wants his mommy.

41:55.203 --> 41:56.639
Oh, I see how it is.

41:56.989 --> 41:58.367
Ben, no.

41:58.367 --> 42:00.183
It's not what it looks like.

42:00.183 --> 42:01.610
I hope not, because
what it looks like is--

42:01.610 --> 42:03.057
It's not.

42:06.009 --> 42:09.109
Listen, I, uh-- I'd better get
going. I got a plane to catch.

42:12.319 --> 42:13.195
Ben.

42:14.128 --> 42:15.140
Have a good summer.
