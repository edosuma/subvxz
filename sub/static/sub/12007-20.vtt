John: <i>Previously on Switched at Birth...</i>

00:01.761 --> 00:03.310
Daphne: <i>I kissed someone in Mexico.</i>

00:03.346 --> 00:06.480
- Was it that audiologist guy?
- It didn't mean anything, I swear.

00:06.515 --> 00:10.100
They're going over to the
Waite Gallery for my show.

00:10.152 --> 00:14.221
The fact that this guy even
likes my stuff is beyond crazy.

00:14.256 --> 00:16.023
Oh! Emmett!

00:23.165 --> 00:24.998
- It's a boy.
- We're having a boy?

00:25.034 --> 00:26.967
Yeah! (Laughs)

00:27.019 --> 00:28.802
There's nothing left for me to liquidate.

00:28.838 --> 00:31.605
- That pretty much taps me out.
- Why didn't you talk to me?

00:31.640 --> 00:35.776
Kathryn, I am trying to find
a way to make this all work.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.248
Hey, stop! Regina, someone just took Will.

00:41.283 --> 00:43.417
She's his mother. We're
not calling the police.

00:43.452 --> 00:45.775
Eric is a good guy. He only took Will

00:45.776 --> 00:47.889
because it was a really
dangerous situation.

00:47.890 --> 00:49.790
So Eric is the kidnapper.

00:49.825 --> 00:53.660
You wanna tell us why you let
a fugitive move into our house?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.530
I only found out a couple months ago.

00:56.565 --> 00:59.199
So before you asked if he
could move into our house.

00:59.234 --> 01:02.202
He had put it all behind him
years ago. He made a fresh start.

01:02.237 --> 01:05.337
I didn't think it was fair to
tell everyone his private business.

01:05.373 --> 01:09.092
- That he's a fugitive?
- He took his son out of a dangerous situation,

01:09.144 --> 01:10.336
which you and I talked about.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.357
You said you would do whatever
you could to protect your child.

01:13.766 --> 01:15.682
I didn't know we were talking about Eric,

01:15.718 --> 01:16.983
and I didn't mean breaking the law.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.653
He was trying to do the
right thing for Will.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.855
Kathryn: Do you know
the risk you put us in?

01:21.890 --> 01:24.691
For all we know, we're breaking
the law just by housing him!

01:24.727 --> 01:28.428
Regina, you call the cops
on that guy or I will.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.515
I will figure it out, I promise.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.535
- Just give me some time.
- One day. We'll give you one day.

01:39.324 --> 01:43.143
I always defend you to
him, but not this time.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.249
I want you to know I'm not
upset at you for telling them.

01:49.284 --> 01:51.852
Oh, don't worry. I'm not apologizing.

01:57.025 --> 01:59.993

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:05.000 --> 02:08.835
I think I would be a great
asset to the mission in China.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.922
While sign language is
different in every country,

02:11.974 --> 02:14.975
the deaf experience has
so many similarities.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.678
And maybe I could be a role model to them,

02:18.680 --> 02:22.732
to show that anything is
possible for a deaf person.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.902
- Is that too cheesy?
- Well, it's an interview, right?

02:25.938 --> 02:27.788
You're supposed to say stuff like that.

02:27.823 --> 02:30.774
Besides, isn't this Gabe dude,
like, Melody's boyfriend anyways?

02:30.826 --> 02:31.992
Doesn't that make you a shoo-in?

02:32.027 --> 02:34.578
I don't wanna take anything for granted.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.663
Especially after what
happened with Marillo.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.833
- Well, she's wrong.
- Oh, god, I want this.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.919
A six-week internship in
China fitting hearing aids?

02:42.955 --> 02:45.872
That would look amazing on
my med school application.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.708
Yeah, which is, like, years away.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.544
I need all the help I can get.

02:50.596 --> 02:52.796
(Sighs) All right, go
kick some interview butt.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.553
Oh!

03:02.298 --> 03:05.265
Cannot believe that you're having
your own freaking show at 19.

03:05.301 --> 03:07.467
- This is crazy.
- Yeah, I guess.

03:09.471 --> 03:13.273
Bay. Whatever happens with Regina

03:13.309 --> 03:16.443
and Eric and his ex-wife, it
has nothing to do with you.

03:16.478 --> 03:20.530
It'll work itself out. Tonight
is the biggest night of your life.

03:20.566 --> 03:23.400
- You gotta enjoy it.
- Okay.

03:23.452 --> 03:25.485
Yeah.

03:25.537 --> 03:28.288
That is the owner of the
gallery, Matthew Waite.

03:28.324 --> 03:32.492
- He's the one who booked me.
- Sweet. Go shmooze. I got this stuff.

03:34.747 --> 03:39.466
Hi. Um, excuse me. Hey.
Um, I'm Bay Kennish.

03:39.501 --> 03:42.302
- I'm sorry. Who?
- The artist.

03:43.339 --> 03:44.671
The show that's happening tonight.

03:44.673 --> 03:47.424
Oh, right. Hey.

03:47.476 --> 03:49.643
Well, I was wondering if
I could see a price sheet.

03:49.678 --> 03:51.678
I mean, that's totally
up to you, obviously,

03:51.730 --> 03:54.648
I was just hoping I could
see one before tonight.

03:54.683 --> 03:55.732
And also, what will you be serving?

03:55.768 --> 03:57.684
I mean, wine and cheese, um,

03:57.686 --> 03:59.620
but, like, will there be any appetizers?

03:59.655 --> 04:02.456
Um, are there any art critics coming?

04:02.491 --> 04:07.661
Well, you can serve whatever you
like and price them however you like.

04:09.365 --> 04:12.582
This is your thing. Just go crazy.

04:12.618 --> 04:15.619
Cool. Thanks!

04:15.671 --> 04:17.536
(Car starts)

04:21.377 --> 04:22.709
Let's just get through this closing

04:22.711 --> 04:25.429
and this whole financial
mess will be behind us.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.547
Thank god. (Laughs)

04:27.549 --> 04:30.267
Okay. Get your game face on.

04:33.355 --> 04:36.556
Hey, Tom. John Kennish, nice to meet you.

04:36.608 --> 04:39.309
- My wife, Kathryn.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

04:39.395 --> 04:41.762
A pleasure. I believe you
already know my lawyer.

04:43.399 --> 04:44.481
Craig?

04:46.485 --> 04:48.618
- Hey! Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

04:50.406 --> 04:51.705
- What was it again?
- John: Craig represented us

04:51.740 --> 04:53.707
in a lawsuit we filed against a hospital

04:53.742 --> 04:55.459
that had switched our daughters at birth.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.494
But he said there'd be no
conflict of interest here.

05:05.421 --> 05:08.255
- No, not at all.
- Yeah, absolutely not.

05:08.257 --> 05:10.991
Shall we head in?

05:11.527 --> 05:14.327
The building itself is in great shape,

05:14.363 --> 05:16.480
but the plumbing is 30 years old.

05:16.515 --> 05:19.481
The inspection showed cracks
in both the supply lines

05:19.482 --> 05:20.482
and the drainage system.

05:20.536 --> 05:24.438
As a result, we've had to revise our offer.

05:27.276 --> 05:30.043
Are you kidding me?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.079
This is 30 percent less.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.450
That's because I'm gonna have to tear up

05:33.451 --> 05:34.751
the whole parking lot to fix the pipes,

05:34.917 --> 05:36.917
which means closing down
for at least two months.

05:36.952 --> 05:39.753
This place was for sale "as is."

05:39.805 --> 05:41.855
You made a firm offer, which we accepted.

05:41.890 --> 05:44.691
- Contingent on inspection.
- We had a deal.

05:44.727 --> 05:45.959
Kathryn: Hold on. We
all want this to close.

05:45.994 --> 05:47.894
I'm sure we can find some middle ground.

05:47.896 --> 05:49.579
There is no middle ground here.

05:49.631 --> 05:52.816
We will not accept anything
less than your original offer.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.735
Well, I'm sorry, but
that's as high as I'll go.

05:54.770 --> 05:58.522
Then you're gonna have
to find another car wash.

06:04.313 --> 06:07.080
Will should get both of his parents

06:07.116 --> 06:09.405
or he'll always feel like
he missed out on one of them.

06:09.406 --> 06:11.006
Trust me on this.

06:11.186 --> 06:14.054
You want me and Hope to get back
together and live happily ever after?

06:14.089 --> 06:18.158
- That's never gonna happen.
- I'm not saying live together, but parent together.

06:18.273 --> 06:22.759
If you were to move back to Atlanta, with
all three of you living in the same city...

06:22.811 --> 06:25.111
- I can't stand that woman!
- Think about Will.

06:25.147 --> 06:29.049
If she is willing and able to
be part of his life right now,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.785
- he deserves that.
- Well, she doesn't deserve him.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.788
This isn't about what she
wants or what you want.

06:34.823 --> 06:36.723
This is about what's best for your son.

06:36.758 --> 06:38.491
How can you even suggest this?

06:38.527 --> 06:41.595
Because I'm trying to
keep you and Will together!

06:41.630 --> 06:44.598
Besides keeping you out of jail.

06:44.616 --> 06:47.400
Do you really think this is easy for me?

06:49.705 --> 06:52.572
Well, even if I said yes,
Hope would never go for it.

06:52.608 --> 06:55.442
She hates me just as much as I hate her.

06:55.477 --> 06:58.278
Let me talk to her, mother to mother.

07:04.369 --> 07:09.923
Bay: Hi. Yes, I'm on hold for
Kendall Booth, the art critic?

07:12.828 --> 07:15.862
Oh, hi, Ms. Booth!

07:15.914 --> 07:19.766
Hi! Yes, I'm calling
from the Waite Gallery.

07:19.801 --> 07:24.621
My name is... Joan Cabernet.

07:24.673 --> 07:27.540
It is so nice to speak with you. Um...

07:27.576 --> 07:30.543
I was just calling to tell you
about a show happening tonight

07:30.579 --> 07:33.647
with a promising young artist
that I wanted to alert you about.

07:33.682 --> 07:37.751
Her name is Bay Kennish, and I really,
really think you're going to enjoy her work.

07:37.786 --> 07:42.555
It's sort of Barbara Kruger meets
Frida Kahlo meets typography.

07:45.244 --> 07:47.344
You will? All right! Yes!

07:47.379 --> 07:49.562
Yes, the show is from seven to nine.

07:49.564 --> 07:53.333
And I will see you tonight. Okay, bye.

07:53.385 --> 07:56.386
She's coming!

08:01.109 --> 08:02.976
- Quinn!
- Hi, you.

08:03.011 --> 08:05.111
(Chuckles) What are you doing here?

08:05.147 --> 08:06.913
I'm actually interviewing you.

08:06.949 --> 08:08.748
I thought I was meeting with Gabe.

08:08.784 --> 08:09.950
There's been a change of plans.

08:09.985 --> 08:14.587
- I'm taking the lead.
- Oh, cool.

08:14.623 --> 08:15.922
It's good to see you! (Laughs)

08:15.958 --> 08:19.492
- Should we get started?
- Yeah, sure.

08:19.528 --> 08:21.795
Hey, look, um...

08:21.830 --> 08:25.765
I really want this internship, but
I don't want things to be weird.

08:25.801 --> 08:28.618
- Why would they be weird?
- You know...

08:28.654 --> 08:30.503
Everything that happened with us?

08:30.505 --> 08:32.371
It's all behind us.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.441
I promise I'll treat you like anybody else.

08:34.493 --> 08:38.178
- Completely professional.
- Okay. Great. Let's do this.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.212
All right.

08:44.369 --> 08:47.253
They changed the deal on us!
What was I supposed to do?

08:47.255 --> 08:49.356
You're supposed to stay
at the table and negotiate,

08:49.358 --> 08:51.257
not walk away without even consulting me!

08:51.293 --> 08:53.927
- There will be other offers.
- And what if there's not?

08:53.962 --> 08:56.896
John, we're running out of moves on
the chess board here. What's next, huh?

08:56.948 --> 08:59.866
Don't overreact.
Everything is gonna be fine.

08:59.901 --> 09:03.053
I have been calm for months, waiting
for you to clean up this mess.

09:03.105 --> 09:06.706
And now I have to go put on a dress
and go to my daughter's gallery opening

09:06.742 --> 09:10.010
and act like everything is
fine. When do I get to panic,

09:10.045 --> 09:14.664
and get angry and outraged and
stomp out of the room? Huh?!

09:14.716 --> 09:16.549
When is my turn?!

09:18.000 --> 09:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:30.510 --> 09:33.444
(No audible dialogue)

09:43.456 --> 09:46.957
- How's Keon?
- Fine.

09:46.993 --> 09:49.360
Are you sure you're okay with this?

09:49.395 --> 09:52.813
Actually, no. I don't like it one bit.

09:52.865 --> 09:55.833
- See? I told you.
- But I love my son.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.987
He deserves both a mother and a father.

10:00.022 --> 10:01.839
How do I know you're not gonna run again?

10:01.874 --> 10:03.841
You'll have to trust me.

10:03.893 --> 10:06.527
Just like I have to trust
that you're done with drugs.

10:06.579 --> 10:08.612
- I am.
- Time will tell.

10:08.648 --> 10:12.583
Keon and I still need
money, and we had a deal.

10:12.618 --> 10:17.421
The Cracked Mug. I'll
buy you out. Fifty grand.

10:18.558 --> 10:19.657
Take it or leave it.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.512
Fine. We'll meet you back here.

10:28.534 --> 10:31.135
I can't believe you got her to agree.

10:31.187 --> 10:33.070
She loves her son too.

10:34.073 --> 10:36.173
Come on. You gotta pack.

10:43.115 --> 10:46.016
Wow. Hi.

10:46.052 --> 10:47.735
Thanks for meeting with me.

10:47.787 --> 10:48.986
I was surprised to get your text.

10:50.823 --> 10:53.007
Uh...

10:53.059 --> 10:54.825
John doesn't know I'm here.

10:56.696 --> 11:00.464
- So where are you gonna be again?
- Everywhere!

11:00.499 --> 11:04.335
Beijing, Shanghai, Hong
Kong, uh, Guangzhou.

11:04.337 --> 11:06.470
- (Laughs)
- Told you you'd nail it.

11:06.505 --> 11:10.424
- Thank you. Or "shieh shieh!"
- Oh.

11:12.445 --> 11:15.279
There's actually something
else I have to tell you.

11:15.331 --> 11:20.084
- Okay.
- Um, Quinn is coming on the trip.

11:20.119 --> 11:23.337
How do you know that? I thought
you guys weren't talking anymore.

11:23.372 --> 11:27.224
Uh, we're not.

11:27.226 --> 11:29.860
But he interviewed me today.

11:29.879 --> 11:32.963
Wait, wait, this guy is in KC?

11:32.999 --> 11:36.100
Yeah, he's taking over for Gabe.

11:36.152 --> 11:38.936
Um, so he was the one who gave you the job?

11:38.971 --> 11:41.755
Technically, yeah.

11:42.975 --> 11:46.594
- What?
- He's trying to get in your pants.

11:46.629 --> 11:49.847
- Or I'm qualified for the job.
- That is so naive.

11:49.849 --> 11:51.649
It's naive to think I'm qualified?

11:51.684 --> 11:53.751
It's naive to think that
the fact that he kissed you

11:53.803 --> 11:56.320
and is attracted to you
has no part of his decision.

11:56.355 --> 12:00.291
We talked about it. He said he'd
keep it completely professional.

12:00.343 --> 12:02.459
Of course he's gonna say that.
What else is he gonna say?

12:02.495 --> 12:05.229
Well, he's coming to Bay's opening tonight.

12:05.264 --> 12:08.132
- You invited him?
- Of course not!

12:08.167 --> 12:11.135
Melody and Gabe are bringing him.

12:11.153 --> 12:14.972
- Babe, it's all good.
- Yeah, for him, it is.

12:15.007 --> 12:17.257
Mingo, there's nothing to worry about.

12:17.310 --> 12:20.327
And I will tongue kiss you
in front of him all night long

12:20.363 --> 12:23.947
if that's what it takes to prove
to you there's nothing going on.

12:23.983 --> 12:25.707
Perfect. Can't wait to meet the guy

12:25.708 --> 12:28.210
who kissed you and then offered you a job.

12:29.755 --> 12:31.722
But "it's all good."

- Amazing!

13:06.319 --> 13:08.303
- Wow!
- How are you feeling?

13:08.338 --> 13:13.107
- Oh, I'm good, thank you.
- Sweetie, we are so proud of you.

13:13.143 --> 13:15.810
Thank you. I'm nervous.

13:15.845 --> 13:17.695
Are you kidding? It's gonna be great.

13:17.731 --> 13:20.948
- For sure.
- Where's Mom?

13:20.984 --> 13:22.717
Uh, she's coming.

13:26.823 --> 13:30.775
I understand that the place isn't
brand-new, but 30 percent less?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.494
We both know that's not fair.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.463
We assumed there was
gonna be a negotiation,

13:35.482 --> 13:38.349
not a blow-up and a
complete shutdown of talks.

13:38.401 --> 13:42.553
Okay. How about this: 20
percent and a shorter escrow?

13:42.589 --> 13:45.440
If I say...

13:45.475 --> 13:48.242
I'll push him up to 15 percent,

13:48.278 --> 13:50.111
can we stop talking about this?

13:50.146 --> 13:53.081
(Laughs) Yeah.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.819
(Chuckles) Yeah.

13:57.854 --> 14:00.822
So, Mingo, this is Quinn.

14:00.824 --> 14:02.807
Quinn, this is my boyfriend, Mingo.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.008
Nice to finally meet you.

14:05.695 --> 14:07.745
Hey, I hear you're the guns and buns champ

14:07.797 --> 14:09.764
of South Padre Island.

14:09.799 --> 14:11.983
Gonna defend your title next year?

14:12.035 --> 14:13.935
I might have mentioned it.

14:13.970 --> 14:18.706
So you don't sign, huh?
Daphne didn't mention that.

14:18.742 --> 14:24.312
I just assumed you working with deaf
people all day, you might take a lesson.

14:24.314 --> 14:28.649
Actually, I was thinking of offering
classes to everyone in the group.

14:28.685 --> 14:30.601
That's such a good idea.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.154
Oh, man, I was looking up hikes in China.

14:33.189 --> 14:36.324
There's this place called Tiger
Leaping Gorge, how cool is that?

14:36.359 --> 14:38.159
It's an 18 mile hike, but
I know you're up for it.

14:38.194 --> 14:41.212
She's a machine. I could barely
keep up with her in Mexico.

14:41.247 --> 14:45.066
I know. We go running
together every morning.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.035
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.904
- Can I get you guys anything?
- No.

14:49.939 --> 14:51.873
I'm good, thanks.

14:56.346 --> 14:58.846
He is definitely into you.

15:04.184 --> 15:06.680
What have you been doing
the past three years?

15:07.388 --> 15:10.456
Uh, well, let's see. Uh...

15:10.491 --> 15:14.259
I wrote a memoir about the
switch, which you know about.

15:14.295 --> 15:18.497
And then I, um, wrote an erotica novel.

15:18.499 --> 15:21.233
I knew that.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.035
I was in a bookstore in the Philly airport,

15:23.070 --> 15:25.137
I started bragging to the
girl behind the counter.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.256
"I know her, I know her!"

15:27.308 --> 15:30.909
Actually, read it. Pretty racy. Hm?

15:30.945 --> 15:33.779
(Laughs)

15:33.814 --> 15:36.031
You know, I almost reached out to you...

15:38.085 --> 15:39.685
You should've.

15:44.825 --> 15:47.626

- I'm Bay Kennish.
- Oh. Nice to meet you.

16:15.055 --> 16:17.823
- (Both laugh)
- Nice to meet you too.

16:17.875 --> 16:21.176

- Uh, yes. Absolutely. Come on.

17:37.538 --> 17:39.705
So what inspired these?

17:39.740 --> 17:44.409
Well, um, I had an experience this year...

17:44.445 --> 17:47.312
A private one, that was
suddenly made public,

17:47.348 --> 17:49.548
and a lot of people had opinions about it.

17:49.583 --> 17:54.119
They used language, both
verbal and written, to label me,

17:54.154 --> 17:57.155
to define my experience for me.

17:58.976 --> 18:00.359
Uh, what's going on?

18:00.361 --> 18:03.295
- Oh. Hi, Matt.
- So what are you doing here?

18:03.330 --> 18:06.031
Someone from your office invited me.

18:06.066 --> 18:08.066
If they did, that was a misunderstanding,

18:08.085 --> 18:09.835
and I'd like to know who called you.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.970
A Joan Cabernet?

18:15.676 --> 18:19.711
That... must've been my publicist.

18:19.747 --> 18:20.746
Um...

18:20.798 --> 18:23.849
I'm gonna go get some wine.

18:25.853 --> 18:28.337
I'm so sorry.

18:28.372 --> 18:31.390
I just know that it's standard
to invite critics to openings,

18:31.392 --> 18:33.559
and since you hadn't
had a chance to do it...

18:33.611 --> 18:36.178
You know what? I've had enough of this.

18:36.213 --> 18:39.197
I agreed to pretend this was a real
show to make your boyfriend happy,

18:39.233 --> 18:41.366
but when you put my reputation on the line

18:41.402 --> 18:44.052
by inviting my colleague using my name...

18:44.104 --> 18:46.872
Wait, real show?

18:46.907 --> 18:49.041
Did you say "boyfriend"? I'm sorry.

18:49.076 --> 18:50.842
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:50.844 --> 18:53.078
This is a rental, sweetie.

18:53.113 --> 18:56.715
I was dark between shows, so sometimes
I let people rent the place out.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.051
Your boyfriend paid me $400 for the night.

18:59.053 --> 19:01.954
I hadn't seen your work until just now.

19:01.989 --> 19:04.790
I don't have a boyfriend.

19:04.825 --> 19:06.758
Trevor.

19:06.794 --> 19:09.878
- Trenton.
- Travis?

19:09.914 --> 19:12.798
And there you go.

19:19.669 --> 19:21.993
Here's the title and
paperwork for all the business.

19:23.010 --> 19:26.145
- And I wired you the money.
- Thank you.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.981
As soon as you guys get
settled, I'll come for a visit.

19:29.016 --> 19:32.918
Absolutely. This isn't a goodbye.

19:35.690 --> 19:38.457
I can still picture the
first time I saw you,

19:38.509 --> 19:40.609
walking into the Cracked Mug.

19:40.645 --> 19:44.363
I'd just broken a taillight
on your motorcycle.

19:44.398 --> 19:45.631
I thought you were so beautiful.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.077
Oh, my god!

19:59.147 --> 20:00.279
- Are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

20:00.314 --> 20:02.298
- I'm fine.
- Where's your mom?

20:02.333 --> 20:04.183
I snuck out of the motel
when she went to pay the bill.

20:04.218 --> 20:05.985
She said me and you are
going to Atlanta with her,

20:06.020 --> 20:07.987
and I wanted to say goodbye to Regina.

20:08.022 --> 20:11.657
- Oh, sweetie.
- I like living here.

20:11.692 --> 20:14.043
- I don't want to go.
- I don't want you to either,

20:14.078 --> 20:16.896
but now you get to spend
time with both your parents.

20:18.566 --> 20:20.599
Will, go check your room,

20:20.635 --> 20:22.885
make sure I didn't forget
anything that you want. Hurry.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.471
Eric, no.

20:25.506 --> 20:27.540
Please don't run. Please.

20:27.575 --> 20:29.308
I can't raise him with that woman.

20:29.343 --> 20:31.494
Eric, listen. If you run, it'll never end.

20:31.529 --> 20:34.146
You'll spend the rest of your
life looking over your shoulder.

20:34.152 --> 20:36.052
I made peace with that a long time ago.

20:36.087 --> 20:39.055
If you go, I will never see you again.

20:39.090 --> 20:42.174
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, Dad. I'm ready.

20:42.226 --> 20:44.794
Please reconsider.

20:47.999 --> 20:50.066
Look, say whatever you
gotta say to get out of this.

20:50.101 --> 20:52.735
Lie about me. Do what you gotta do.

20:53.905 --> 20:55.855
I love you.

21:09.437 --> 21:12.538
- Where's Bay?
- Oh. Hello.

21:12.573 --> 21:16.192
She's making the rounds, I would imagine.

21:16.227 --> 21:20.079
- Is that a new dress?
- Yeah, I, uh, I went shopping.

21:20.114 --> 21:24.433
Good for you. You deserve
a little retail therapy.

21:24.469 --> 21:28.304
And I had a drink with Craig Tebbe.

21:28.339 --> 21:32.041
- Excuse me?
- I wanted to talk about the deal.

21:32.076 --> 21:35.778
- You went behind my back?
- I'm handling it.

21:35.813 --> 21:37.847
You went and had a drink with a guy

21:37.899 --> 21:40.816
who's 15 years younger
than you, in that dress,

21:40.852 --> 21:41.951
that's how you handled it?

21:42.003 --> 21:45.521
We both need this deal to close.

21:45.573 --> 21:48.841
Look me in the eye and you tell
me that it was all about the deal.

21:52.563 --> 21:54.697
That's exactly what I thought.

21:54.732 --> 21:58.501
What is this, Kathryn,
some kind of midlife crisis?

21:58.536 --> 22:02.338
You're about to be a grandmother,
for god's sake. It's embarrassing.

22:02.373 --> 22:06.242
You know what's not embarrassing?

22:06.277 --> 22:10.095
We settled at 15 percent
less instead of 30.

22:10.131 --> 22:12.014
Well, congratulations.

22:12.066 --> 22:13.349
What'd you have to do to make that happen?

22:13.401 --> 22:16.218
We just talked.

22:16.254 --> 22:18.003
But you know what? It was nice.

22:18.055 --> 22:21.023
It was nice to sit in a bar and
have a drink with a handsome guy

22:21.025 --> 22:24.043
and not talk about the fugitive
living in our guesthouse

22:24.095 --> 22:26.162
and our financial problems.

22:26.197 --> 22:30.099
Well, that's marriage.
What do you want me to say?

22:30.134 --> 22:33.903
I want you to thank me
for saving our asses.

22:42.713 --> 22:46.515
- Hey. Having fun?
- Yeah.

22:46.551 --> 22:51.420
I love your portrait. "Zombie
lover." "Puerto Rican"?

22:51.455 --> 22:53.556
You gave me this internship

22:53.608 --> 22:56.325
because I'm qualified for the job, right?

22:58.129 --> 22:59.495
I just want to make it perfectly clear

22:59.530 --> 23:02.064
that I have a boyfriend.

23:02.099 --> 23:03.332
Plus, you'll be my boss out there,

23:03.367 --> 23:08.237
and I've been down that
road, total disaster.

23:08.272 --> 23:11.874
But that's not what this is, right?

23:11.909 --> 23:14.910
Hey, uh, what's going on here?

23:14.946 --> 23:17.913
Uh, we're just having a conversation.

23:17.949 --> 23:20.716
Cool, I'll just be joining it, then.

23:20.735 --> 23:23.869
It's about the trip. I just need a minute.

23:23.921 --> 23:25.854
Yeah, there's a gym around the corner.

23:25.890 --> 23:27.756
Maybe you could pick up a protein shake.

23:27.792 --> 23:28.924
- Excuse me?
- Hey.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.377
Wild guess here, but maybe she's looking

23:31.412 --> 23:34.396
for something with a little
more depth. You know, complexity.

23:35.499 --> 23:37.533
Even though I wanna punch you

23:37.585 --> 23:40.236
in the face right now,

23:40.271 --> 23:42.154
this is really important to my girlfriend.

23:42.206 --> 23:44.240
So I'm going to walk away.

23:51.048 --> 23:52.231
I don't think this is going to work out.

23:52.266 --> 23:55.050
- What isn't?
- China.

23:55.086 --> 23:59.989
- You're withdrawing your offer?
- This has just gotten really... messy.

24:00.024 --> 24:02.725
No! No, no, no! It's not messy.

24:02.760 --> 24:03.993
I just want to do the job.

24:04.028 --> 24:05.828
None of this will be a problem in China.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.896
Yeah, I don't know about that.

24:07.932 --> 24:10.883
Quinn, everything I said
in my interview was true.

24:10.935 --> 24:12.768
You know I could help those people.

24:12.770 --> 24:14.436
I know what they're going through.

24:14.455 --> 24:17.506
Please, just let me come and do the work.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.725
I'm sorry.

24:30.495 --> 24:32.388
Why do you keep doing this?

24:33.925 --> 24:36.108
Do you really think that I'm so pathetic

24:36.160 --> 24:38.377
that I can't do anything for myself?

24:43.968 --> 24:47.236
My first-ever commission
was a lady who just wanted

24:47.271 --> 24:49.038
to get close to me to kidnap her kid back,

24:49.073 --> 24:52.074
and now I find out that the only expert

24:52.109 --> 24:54.810
who's ever validated my work was paid off?

24:54.845 --> 24:58.781
I feel like a five-year-old
who just found out her parents

24:58.816 --> 25:01.851
paid kids to come to her birthday party!

25:06.457 --> 25:10.659
But I want to earn it, or
else it doesn't mean anything.

25:10.695 --> 25:12.528
Don't you get that?

25:12.563 --> 25:14.630
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

25:17.034 --> 25:19.284
I know that you mean well, Travis, I do,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.105
but you have got to stop. Okay?

25:21.106 --> 25:22.505
You've got to.

25:22.506 --> 25:25.307
What do you mean you can't? Why not?

25:32.333 --> 25:34.283
That's ridiculous.

25:47.615 --> 25:48.580
You're confused.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.967
We both had our hearts
broken at the same time.

25:51.969 --> 25:54.337
We were miserable together.

25:55.089 --> 25:57.873
And I was the first person
you told about something

25:57.908 --> 25:59.808
very painful that happened to you,

25:59.810 --> 26:01.543
and I'm glad that you did,

26:01.579 --> 26:03.461
but that doesn't mean that you and I are...

26:04.299 --> 26:08.384
And then we both grew apart
from Emmett, which was hard,

26:08.419 --> 26:09.585
which was really hard.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.193
Well, you can't be.

26:29.153 --> 26:30.806
You saw that none of that was real.

26:36.714 --> 26:39.848
Travis, I am in the middle of...

26:39.884 --> 26:41.784
Admittedly my fake art opening.

26:50.578 --> 26:52.594
Even if I did feel...

26:53.597 --> 26:55.764
I couldn't do that to Mary Beth.

26:57.855 --> 26:59.701
Well, then I couldn't do it to Emmett.

26:59.703 --> 27:02.940
I made a promise to him that
we wouldn't torture each other!

28:13.806 --> 28:16.707
I was just sitting here...

28:16.759 --> 28:20.727
thinking about everything
that happened this year.

28:54.079 --> 28:57.247
That's a lot for anyone. Isn't it?

29:03.222 --> 29:06.190
Travis rented the space for me.

29:06.225 --> 29:08.075
It was all a lie.

29:34.553 --> 29:36.420
(Scoffs)

29:38.257 --> 29:42.192
Travis thinks that he's in love with me.

29:45.733 --> 29:47.975
How do you feel about that?

30:00.796 --> 30:02.779
Even if it's with Travis?

30:07.219 --> 30:10.554
I really don't know what I want.

30:12.725 --> 30:14.691
And I'm so proud of you.

30:14.727 --> 30:18.629

30:39.018 --> 30:42.286
Since the day we got together,
you've had your doubts about us.

30:42.321 --> 30:44.955
- That's not true.
- First it was your friends,

30:45.007 --> 30:46.106
and then it was the deaf/hearing thing,

30:46.141 --> 30:47.924
and then ever since you went to Mexico,

30:47.960 --> 30:49.092
that guy just keeps popping up.

30:49.128 --> 30:50.210
It's not just him,

30:50.245 --> 30:52.829
it was what he represents.

30:52.865 --> 30:56.066
He gets to see the world
and change people's lives.

30:56.068 --> 30:57.968
He's living the life that I want.

30:58.003 --> 31:00.771
- Then go live it.
- He just fired me!

31:00.806 --> 31:03.974
Then go to China without him.
I mean, you have a plane ticket.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.810
You can not just read a
map, but write a new one.

31:06.845 --> 31:08.779
So go, on your own.

31:08.814 --> 31:10.747
Scratch that adventure itch.

31:15.354 --> 31:18.422
- I'm gonna do that.
- Good.

31:28.334 --> 31:30.434
For the record,

31:30.469 --> 31:34.071
I don't just think of you as a...

31:34.123 --> 31:36.206
guy who drinks protein shakes.

31:36.241 --> 31:40.110
Mingo, you are the kindest
person I have ever met.

31:41.246 --> 31:44.765
You're the only boyfriend I've ever had

31:44.800 --> 31:48.785
who's taken sign language lessons for me.

31:49.221 --> 31:52.889
But I think we should take
the summer, see what happens.

31:52.958 --> 31:57.828
- Mingo...
- China's gonna change you. I can already tell that.

31:57.863 --> 31:59.963
And that's... that's great.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.670
I just, I don't wanna force
anything when you get back.

32:03.705 --> 32:07.807
So let's just see how we feel in the fall.

32:07.843 --> 32:08.875
Okay?

32:11.580 --> 32:12.812
I'm going to miss you.

You know what? Uh...

32:40.108 --> 32:42.042
There'll be others.

32:47.816 --> 32:50.016
I know I've made some bad decisions.

32:50.052 --> 32:53.987
I just wanted it all to work out.

32:54.022 --> 32:56.089
I really thought he was my second chance.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.994
Look, I've made some bad choices

33:01.029 --> 33:02.829
when it comes to love, too.

33:02.864 --> 33:06.633
You're gonna see him everywhere,

33:06.685 --> 33:08.735
for a really long time.

33:10.505 --> 33:12.639
You'll probably love him forever.

33:12.804 --> 33:16.573
But it gets better.

33:16.608 --> 33:19.442
I promise.

33:19.478 --> 33:21.611
Listen to you.

33:23.381 --> 33:24.647
My grown-up girl.

33:33.558 --> 33:36.443
Hey, look, I'm sorry if I overreacted.

33:36.495 --> 33:38.378
- If?
- Regina: Hey.

33:40.265 --> 33:43.399
I wanted you both to know that it's over.

33:43.401 --> 33:46.369
- Eric and Will are gone.
- They left? Just like that?

33:46.404 --> 33:49.105
- Where did they go?
- She doesn't know.

33:49.141 --> 33:51.941
But they won't be a problem anymore.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.794
Honey, I know you're sad,

33:54.846 --> 33:56.146
but there really wasn't
any other way for this to...

33:56.181 --> 33:59.883
- (loud banging)
- Police! Hands up!

33:59.918 --> 34:00.917
(Guns cock)

34:03.138 --> 34:05.260
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Marcus Paxton,

34:05.261 --> 34:06.857
also known as Eric Bishop.

34:06.858 --> 34:08.024
Oh, my god!

34:15.507 --> 34:18.426
So you just barge into my
house and knock the door down?

34:18.460 --> 34:20.344
Look, we have an arrest
warrant for a fugitive

34:20.396 --> 34:22.697
who we were tipped off was armed
and living on your property.

34:22.699 --> 34:24.498
Who said he was armed, his ex-wife?

34:24.550 --> 34:26.567
Charging in here, guns blazing!

34:26.601 --> 34:29.136
We have kids. We have a deaf daughter!

34:29.138 --> 34:30.353
Let me ask you something.

34:30.389 --> 34:34.141
Do you know who I am? I
am a former state senator.

34:34.177 --> 34:37.178
I don't care who you are, if you're
housing a criminal who kidnapped a minor.

34:37.230 --> 34:39.996
- We had no idea about his past.
- That's true.

34:40.032 --> 34:42.216
You know what? Enough of this.
I want to see a search warrant.

34:42.251 --> 34:44.885
Sir, I don't need a search warrant,
all I need is a warrant for his arrest.

34:44.937 --> 34:46.954
And if you don't sit down,
I'm gonna put you in cuffs.

34:46.989 --> 34:50.875
You're going to handcuff me after storming
into my house and breaking down my door?

34:50.927 --> 34:52.176
- I will have you fired.
- John...

34:52.210 --> 34:54.261
- John, this is not helping.
- Sir, I'm going to ask you

34:54.263 --> 34:56.731
- to put your hands behind your back.
- Oh, you're arresting me now?

34:56.783 --> 34:58.916
I'm restraining you. You're
not being very cooperative.

34:58.968 --> 35:01.135
And yeah, you keep this
up, I will arrest you.

35:01.170 --> 35:03.804
You know what? This is ridiculous!

35:03.840 --> 35:07.007
Hey. Whoa! Dad! What is going on?

35:07.043 --> 35:09.877
- Honey, it's fine.
- Have a seat, calm down.

35:09.912 --> 35:11.879
- (Grunts)
- We're gonna do our job,

35:11.914 --> 35:13.614
and everything will be over soon.

35:13.649 --> 35:14.715
Mom, Toby just texted.

35:14.751 --> 35:16.584
They're at the hospital. The baby's coming.

35:16.619 --> 35:19.687
Oh, my god! Officer, my son is
about to have a baby. Please!

35:19.722 --> 35:23.657
- You're free to go.
- Thank you, but...

35:23.693 --> 35:25.326
Go, go. I'll handle this.

35:25.361 --> 35:28.562
I'm keeping you cuffed until
we finish sweeping the area.

35:28.598 --> 35:33.001
- Kathryn, do something!
- I am doing something. I'm going to the hospital.

35:36.439 --> 35:40.307
Cops in the driveway and you kissed Travis?

35:40.343 --> 35:44.044
- That's a hell of a night.
- And...

35:44.096 --> 35:47.314
It was actually kind of a great kiss.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.918
So are you considering it? You should.

35:50.953 --> 35:54.054
- He's the best guy.
- I know he is.

35:54.090 --> 35:57.992
But, Daphne, my head is spinning right now.

35:58.027 --> 36:01.762
Of course it is. You need... (Gasps)

36:03.132 --> 36:06.801
- What just happened?
- You should come with me.

36:06.836 --> 36:09.670
- To China?
- Yes!

36:09.672 --> 36:11.839
You didn't go to L.A. because of me.

36:11.891 --> 36:14.692
And you had a horrible year.

36:14.744 --> 36:16.610
You'll bring your sketchbook.

36:16.646 --> 36:19.680
We'll see the Great Wall, eat crazy food.

36:19.715 --> 36:21.582
You'll get inspired.

36:21.617 --> 36:25.686
We'll have an adventure, you and me.

36:25.721 --> 36:27.454
