WEBVTT

00:09.517 --> 00:13.730
(Frasier) Ah, yes,
another beautiful Saturday night.

00:13.897 --> 00:18.068
The moon is full.
The city lights are twinkling.

00:18.234 --> 00:20.570
Lovers steal kisses in the park.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.240
And here...

00:24.407 --> 00:26.451
...chez Crane...

00:27.702 --> 00:30.830
...my father and his assistant
sit hunched

00:30.997 --> 00:34.584
over 20-year-old photographs
of a murdered hooker.

00:35.502 --> 00:38.505
Life is a banquet.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.382
I enjoy looking at this old case.

00:41.549 --> 00:46.054
Just because you have no plans,
don't spoil our harmless fun.

00:46.221 --> 00:50.516
We Brits do love a grisly murder
and a nice hot cup of tea.

00:51.434 --> 00:54.270
Daphne, I'm busy, so if you don't mind...

00:54.437 --> 00:57.315
I didn't know I was bothering you.

00:57.482 --> 00:59.734
Sorry. It's this damn case.

00:59.901 --> 01:04.781
The answer to who murdered Helen
is right here. I just can't see it.

01:04.947 --> 01:09.577
You're obsessing. You stare
at these grisly pictures endlessly.

01:09.744 --> 01:11.788
Let's go and see a movie.

01:11.954 --> 01:13.998
- No.
- Pizza?

01:14.165 --> 01:16.209
- Nah.
- Let's get tattooed.

01:17.210 --> 01:21.422
Oh! This is ridiculous!
It's a beautiful night.

01:21.589 --> 01:24.258
I'm going to take a nice long walk.

01:24.425 --> 01:26.928
And I'm not going by myself.

01:31.807 --> 01:36.437
He likes the rhododendrons
on the north side of the park.

01:40.691 --> 01:44.403
(Woman) 'Dr Crane,
thanks to your advice,

01:44.570 --> 01:46.655
'I've conquered my fear of heights.

01:46.822 --> 01:50.326
'I took it slowly,
gradually going higher and higher

01:50.493 --> 01:55.497
'until here I am, having lunch
at the top of the Space Needle.'

01:55.664 --> 02:00.127
- Marjorie, I'm so proud of you.
- (Marjorie) 'When I think of how I...'

02:00.294 --> 02:02.338
(Marjorie screams)

02:02.504 --> 02:05.299
- What happened?
- 'I looked down.'

02:05.466 --> 02:11.180
Look at your luncheon companions
or your menu, but don't look down.

02:11.347 --> 02:13.349
You're only feeding your fears.

02:13.557 --> 02:16.018
'Maybe I'm not ready
for a window table.'

02:16.185 --> 02:20.606
No, no, of course you are.
You can beat this thing.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.734
'You're right.
I can, Dr Crane, if I just...'

02:23.901 --> 02:25.611
(Screams)

02:25.778 --> 02:28.655
- Do not look down!
- 'No, I didn't.

02:28.822 --> 02:31.033
'My cheque just came.'

02:34.494 --> 02:39.374
Well, Marjorie, we're out of time now.
Call me tomorrow, will you?

02:40.459 --> 02:43.879
That's it for today.
Stay tuned for Bulldog Briscoe.

02:44.046 --> 02:48.175
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 Talk Radio.

02:49.134 --> 02:51.178
- Hey, Doc.
- Bulldog.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.722
I caught some of your show today.

02:53.889 --> 02:56.892
lf that whining chick called me,
I'd say,

02:57.059 --> 03:01.146
"lf you don't want people snapping
your bra, don't wear one."

03:03.607 --> 03:05.859
Brilliant in its simplicity.

03:07.652 --> 03:10.071
How does this sound, hard body?

03:10.238 --> 03:13.533
You, me, Sonics, Knicks, tonight?

03:13.700 --> 03:17.037
I'm already going.
I have season tickets.

03:17.203 --> 03:22.000
- We could get together afterwards.
- Only if I smash into your car.

03:22.167 --> 03:26.713
Why do the ones that want it the most
put up the biggest struggle?

03:28.089 --> 03:30.884
Because, when I do finally give in,

03:31.051 --> 03:34.220
I want us to enjoy it all the more.

03:36.055 --> 03:40.685
lf I'm not distracted by the fact
that every man on earth has died.

03:44.063 --> 03:46.691
Almost had her there.

03:46.858 --> 03:49.777
Yes, it could have gone either way.

03:49.944 --> 03:52.822
Well, I can get those any time I want.

03:52.989 --> 03:56.868
- Hello, Frasier.
- Bulldog, my brother, Niles.

03:57.035 --> 04:00.580
- Niles, this is Bulldog Briscoe.
- Just the man.

04:00.747 --> 04:03.833
You can tell me why
none of the local media

04:04.000 --> 04:06.753
carry the Ivy League squash standings.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.550
Whoa! Another one just like you!

04:12.717 --> 04:15.803
Some gypsy
put a curse on your family?

04:17.387 --> 04:21.642
- See you later, Miles.
- It's Niles.

04:21.809 --> 04:23.895
Like it matters.

04:26.981 --> 04:31.193
Are you ready for our boys' night out
at Le Cochon Noir?

04:33.863 --> 04:39.452
Yes. But, Niles, I've been wondering.
Would you mind if Dad joined us?

04:39.618 --> 04:42.913
Last time we took Dad
to a four-star restaurant,

04:43.080 --> 04:46.584
he had a miserable time
and the restaurant lost a star.

04:48.127 --> 04:53.132
I want to get him out. He's on one
of his weeping lotus binges again.

04:53.340 --> 04:58.596
We've taken him everywhere
from the Arboretum to the Zen Garden.

04:58.762 --> 05:01.891
Wait!
The Zen Garden is at the Arboretum.

05:02.057 --> 05:04.810
Have we only taken him one place?

05:06.353 --> 05:10.232
- Oh, Niles, the basketball game!
- Basketball?

05:10.399 --> 05:12.901
Yes. I can get another ticket.

05:13.068 --> 05:17.614
Imagine how excited Dad will be
to go to a game with his two sons.

05:17.781 --> 05:20.659
It's the archetypal male bonding ritual.

05:20.826 --> 05:24.747
Couldn't we just go into the woods
and kill something?

05:25.748 --> 05:29.376
- All right.
- You can see the Tacoma Dome.

05:29.543 --> 05:32.963
I've seen it.
They had a home show there once.

05:33.130 --> 05:37.134
That's where I got the idea
to stencil the Welsh dresser.

05:37.301 --> 05:39.845
I'm a teamster compared to you.

05:43.390 --> 05:48.478
(Man) Peanuts! Peanuts!

05:49.938 --> 05:52.357
Niles, the game's that way!

05:52.524 --> 05:57.112
I'm calculating our escape route
in case of fire or unrest.

05:57.279 --> 06:00.115
- Maris taught me.
- You love her, don't you?

06:00.282 --> 06:03.827
- Yes, I do. Why?
- It helps to know that.

06:03.994 --> 06:09.332
Here we are.
One beer and two glasses of wine.

06:09.499 --> 06:13.920
I'm sure it's good. They opened
a fresh box when they poured it.

06:14.087 --> 06:16.506
You ought to be drinking beer.

06:16.673 --> 06:21.886
Dad, I only drink beer when I eat
German food, which is to say never!

06:22.887 --> 06:28.018
- Did you notice the facilities?
- As you feared: communal urinals.

06:28.184 --> 06:31.021
What do I do about my shy kidneys?

06:32.439 --> 06:34.691
- Aren't these great seats?
- Yeah.

06:36.234 --> 06:39.779
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Lend me your pen.

06:39.946 --> 06:44.451
- What for?
- A note about that ballistics report.

06:44.617 --> 06:47.996
We came here
to get your mind off the case.

06:48.163 --> 06:52.125
I've done some reading.
It seems the key for the Sonics

06:52.292 --> 06:56.588
is to stop Starks from penetrating
and dumping the ball off.

06:56.754 --> 07:01.134
"Stop Starks"? That sounds funny:
stop Starks, stop Starks...

07:01.301 --> 07:03.136
Shut up!

07:04.345 --> 07:08.558
- It makes no sense!
- I'm just quoting some sports writer.

07:08.725 --> 07:14.147
No, Helen was tall, yet the bullet
entered on a downward trajectory.

07:14.313 --> 07:18.735
Dad, please try to participate.
Look, they're starting a wave!

07:22.697 --> 07:27.743
That was fun, wasn't it?
There's a peanut guy. Peanut!

07:28.619 --> 07:30.663
How dare you?

07:30.830 --> 07:34.375
Niles... Stop it!

07:34.542 --> 07:39.005
He's pelting me with peanuts
See that tray! He's come prepared!

07:39.171 --> 07:41.257
Stop it! That is for me!

07:41.424 --> 07:45.136
- I got to make a call.
- Not about the case?

07:45.302 --> 07:48.139
- Yes.
- You've been working on it for years.

07:48.305 --> 07:50.349
Why are you so obsessed now?

07:50.516 --> 07:55.479
I promised her mother that,
however long it took, I'd find the killer.

07:55.646 --> 08:01.527
She called me last week. She's an
old lady living in a home somewhere.

08:01.694 --> 08:04.655
She doesn't have a lot longer to go.

08:04.822 --> 08:07.992
It spurred me on to get it solved.

08:08.158 --> 08:12.329
So I appreciate your bringing me here
but I've got to make this call.

08:12.496 --> 08:14.999
OK, Dad. I understand.

08:16.959 --> 08:21.338
Boy, the traffic tonight is murder.
Hey, pal, what's the score?

08:21.505 --> 08:23.632
"West Side Story".

08:29.513 --> 08:33.475
This picture of the crime scene
has always bugged me.

08:33.642 --> 08:36.895
The way Helen's written "help".
Why?

08:37.062 --> 08:42.525
Well, I suppose the word "howdy"
would have been a bit too cheery.

08:42.693 --> 08:48.448
It makes no sense. Anybody who could
read it could see her lying there.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.413
- Evening, Dad.
- Thanks again for the ball game.

08:54.579 --> 08:58.625
It was a pleasure. I'm sorry
you couldn't join us for dinner.

08:58.792 --> 09:02.254
Le Cochon Noir
gave us a fabulous dinner.

09:02.421 --> 09:06.800
It was marred only by the lack
of even one outstanding cognac

09:06.967 --> 09:09.010
on their <i>carte des digestifs.</i>

09:09.177 --> 09:11.638
But think of it this way.

09:11.805 --> 09:16.143
What's the one thing better
than an exquisite meal?

09:16.309 --> 09:18.353
An exquisite meal

09:18.520 --> 09:22.148
with one tiny flaw
we can pick at all night.

09:23.149 --> 09:26.319
Quite right.
To impossible standards!

09:30.532 --> 09:35.161
- So, Dad, any progress on the case?
- Nah, I'm beat.

09:35.328 --> 09:40.625
Sometimes it's better to start fresh
in the morning. Good night.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.628
Brush your teeth, say your prayers.

09:43.795 --> 09:47.424
I used to say that
when you were kids, didn't I?

09:47.590 --> 09:49.968
- No, you didn't.
- Oh.

09:51.636 --> 09:53.888
- I meant to.
- We knew that.

09:55.515 --> 09:58.059
- Hello.
- Hello, Daphne!

09:58.226 --> 10:01.646
- How was dinner?
- Fine except for one tiny flaw.

10:01.813 --> 10:05.191
Oh, just the way you like it.

10:07.068 --> 10:09.195
I see you're intrigued.

10:09.362 --> 10:11.864
It's a while since I've gone over it.

10:12.031 --> 10:16.786
- Who are these guys?
- The principal players in the drama.

10:16.953 --> 10:20.707
That's Detective Shelby,
the cop who found the body.

10:20.873 --> 10:23.543
Who is this menacing monobrow?

10:23.709 --> 10:27.713
Robitaille, the logger,
an ex-boyfriend of Helen's.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.967
Every few months,
they'd disappear together.

10:31.175 --> 10:33.219
He's the murderer.

10:33.386 --> 10:35.763
- He's got an airtight alibi.
- What?

10:35.930 --> 10:38.849
He was killing somebody else
at the time.

10:40.268 --> 10:43.854
But you have to admit
this case has it all:

10:44.021 --> 10:48.859
sex, greed, jealousy, revenge,
a monkey, hatred, deception...

10:49.026 --> 10:51.612
Wait, wait, wait! A monkey?

10:51.779 --> 10:56.659
This is a snapshot of the murder
victim with her pet monkey, Coco.

10:56.826 --> 11:01.455
He was given to her by
another boyfriend, Clive Brisbane.

11:01.622 --> 11:04.500
- Why wasn't Brisbane a suspect?
- He was.

11:04.667 --> 11:08.921
Witnesses saw him at the racetrack
at the time of the murder.

11:09.088 --> 11:13.384
- Brisbane the animal trainer?
- Yes. Brisbane's Amazing Apes.

11:13.551 --> 11:17.513
They opened in Las Vegas
for Engelbert Humperdinck.

11:18.722 --> 11:23.727
You forget there was a time
when Las Vegas wasn't tacky like now.

11:25.521 --> 11:29.608
I once caught his act
on a trip to Vegas during college.

11:29.775 --> 11:31.819
Those apes were amazing!

11:31.985 --> 11:36.573
They staged a tableau
of Washington crossing the Delaware

11:36.740 --> 11:42.746
and then shot suction-cup arrows
at Brisbane's assistant's derrière.

11:46.583 --> 11:51.505
You know...there is a way
that Brisbane could be the killer

11:51.672 --> 11:54.841
and still have
his horse track alibi hold up.

11:55.968 --> 11:58.512
Daphne, Niles...

11:59.429 --> 12:02.975
I present you with...
the killer!

12:07.562 --> 12:11.650
- A monkey was the trigger man?
- Play along with me.

12:11.817 --> 12:14.945
They can shoot arrows.
Why not a gun?

12:15.112 --> 12:20.283
- Why would Brisbane have her killed?
- Because, because...

12:20.450 --> 12:24.037
- She jilted him for someone else!
- Robitaille!

12:24.204 --> 12:27.499
- Exactly! We've done it!
- You've done it!

12:27.666 --> 12:30.877
Yes, but you were standing
very close by.

12:31.044 --> 12:33.922
Wait a minute. Are we saying here

12:34.089 --> 12:37.300
that a murder was committed
by a monkey?

12:37.926 --> 12:40.637
It's not so very far fetched!

12:41.721 --> 12:46.893
It could be Brisbane's homage
to Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue".

12:47.060 --> 12:50.188
It's about a murderous orang-utan
in Paris.

12:50.355 --> 12:53.191
Wait till we tell Dad. Dad!

12:53.358 --> 12:56.653
No, Niles, wait! It's still just a theory.

12:57.570 --> 13:03.117
And how will Dad feel, knowing we've
cracked a case he couldn't solve?

13:04.160 --> 13:06.454
Oh, dear. You're right.

13:06.621 --> 13:11.709
Wait! It's serendipity that I stumbled
into this. It can happen again.

13:11.876 --> 13:16.214
I'll rearrange the photos
so that Dad will see the connection.

13:16.381 --> 13:21.928
All right, we've got Coco,
the gun and...Helen.

13:22.095 --> 13:25.890
What is it? Oh, no, Frasier!
What are you doing?

13:26.057 --> 13:30.353
No, no. I've got these all set out
the way I want them.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.563
This one goes up...

13:35.149 --> 13:37.819
I'll be damned!

13:38.736 --> 13:40.780
Something wrong?

13:41.989 --> 13:45.701
- Look at that!
- What?

13:45.868 --> 13:49.914
I never thought it would leap out
and bite me like this.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.249
I may have solved this case.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.335
- You have?
- Wonderful!

13:54.543 --> 13:58.756
No. Don't get too excited.
This is kind of far fetched.

13:58.923 --> 14:02.426
It's a long shot,
but it's beginning to make sense.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.012
- Lay it out.
- Guys, please.

14:05.179 --> 14:08.265
Give me a little privacy.
I've got to think.

14:08.432 --> 14:12.353
- No problem.
- I was just going to bed. Night, all.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.522
Good night, Daphne.

14:14.688 --> 14:19.777
Do you see the sparkle in his eye?
He's like a little kid at Christmas.

14:19.944 --> 14:23.405
What happened
to my entry-wound close-ups?

14:23.572 --> 14:26.951
# Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la #

14:34.500 --> 14:36.877
- Hello. Is Dad home?
- Nope.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.297
I haven't seen him
since he knocked me up.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:52.017 --> 14:55.938
- What?
- Knocked me up. Woke me up.

14:56.104 --> 15:00.150
It's an English expression.
What does it mean here?

15:01.777 --> 15:03.946
Oh, something else.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.199
You'd definitely be awake for it, though.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.497
He went to the station
to present his theory.

15:13.664 --> 15:18.251
I wish he hadn't. I've been
turning it over in my mind all day.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.339
The more I think about it,
the goofier it sounds.

15:22.506 --> 15:26.635
I mean, a monkey! I hope they
didn't laugh him out of the station.

15:26.802 --> 15:30.555
It'd be one hell of an end
to a 30-year career.

15:30.722 --> 15:35.894
Now, now, Dr Crane. It's not the most
outlandish theory in the world.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.940
You're right. Could have said
it was a trained giraffe.

15:41.358 --> 15:45.070
I suppose he killed her
by spitting the bullet at her,

15:45.236 --> 15:48.448
thus explaining
the downward trajectory.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.077
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.747
- Heard anything from the station?
- Not yet.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.959
I was afraid of that.
I knew my theory was iffy,

16:00.126 --> 16:03.755
but when I told the guys,
they looked at me like I'd lost my mind.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.591
- They didn't ridicule you?
- No.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.719
They treat old-timers with respect.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.930
They said, "I'll check it out",

16:12.096 --> 16:16.768
like I used to when some nut came in
with aluminium foil in his hat,

16:16.935 --> 16:21.064
claiming the Martians
were stealing his brainwaves.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.902
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what I was thinking of.

16:26.069 --> 16:31.741
I've been trying to figure out how
I came up with such a half-assed theory.

16:31.908 --> 16:36.454
Dad... It wasn't your fault. I did it.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.876
You killed her?

16:43.878 --> 16:47.757
No, but I planted that ridiculous idea
in your head.

16:47.924 --> 16:52.553
Remember when you were upset
I was rearranging your pictures?

16:52.720 --> 16:57.892
I rearranged them so that you would
come to the same conclusion I did.

16:59.185 --> 17:03.189
- So you had the idea first?
- I feel terrible.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.901
Don't blame yourself.
You put the foil on my hat,

17:07.068 --> 17:10.070
but I walked into the station wearing it.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.946
(Doorbell)

17:12.114 --> 17:14.157
I'll get it.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.829
- Oh.
- Hiya, Marty.

17:18.996 --> 17:23.626
Hey, Frank! Frasier, Daphne,
you remember Frank from the precinct.

17:23.791 --> 17:28.005
- Marty, we've got to talk.
- About that theory of mine...

17:28.172 --> 17:31.216
- What were you thinking?
- I know.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.053
I feel so stupid wasting your time.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.390
It cost us a whole afternoon
and five detectives' time.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.435
All we've got to show for it is...

17:42.644 --> 17:45.272
- We got the bastard!
- I was right?

17:45.439 --> 17:48.776
You don't believe me,
ask these derelicts.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.697
- Way to go, Marty!
- Good to see you.

17:53.864 --> 17:58.869
Marty, you've still got it.
And it only took you 20 years.

17:59.036 --> 18:03.248
- Mr Crane, I'm so proud of you!
- That's wonderful!

18:03.415 --> 18:05.459
Oh, that's suede!

18:07.169 --> 18:12.090
- So Marty, how did you do it?
- I thought it was Robitaille,

18:12.257 --> 18:17.012
and then I thought maybe
it was Brisbane, but I was wrong.

18:17.179 --> 18:21.224
How did you finally decide
it was Detective Shelby?

18:21.391 --> 18:24.144
That picture kept bugging me.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.772
Why was she trying to write "help"?

18:26.938 --> 18:31.276
Then it came to me: she wanted
to write the killer's name, Shelby.

18:31.443 --> 18:36.198
She died before she'd done the "b",
someone kicked dirt over the "s".

18:36.364 --> 18:40.452
You nailed him.
We interrogated him. He cracked.

18:43.163 --> 18:48.960
Sorry I doubted you, but you also
wondered if a monkey could murder.

18:49.127 --> 18:54.215
I may have momentarily doubted it,
but I have to learn to trust my gift.

18:56.176 --> 19:01.514
- Did you call the girl's mother?
- No, you do it. You solved this.

19:01.681 --> 19:07.479
I can't take all the credit for it,
right, Frasier? Get over here.

19:07.645 --> 19:11.858
- Oh, now, Dad...
- Don't be shy. I'm proud of you!

19:12.025 --> 19:17.530
I was a cop for 30 years and it took
my son with his PhD mind to crack it.

19:17.697 --> 19:21.159
Plus I was standing next to him
at the time.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.330
- So, tell us about it, Frasier.
- Oh, no!

19:25.496 --> 19:28.541
- Come on!
- Well, all right, then.

19:28.708 --> 19:33.421
I hate to toot my own horn,
but if it'll make Dad happy...

19:33.588 --> 19:35.882
It was my expertise
in human behaviour

19:36.049 --> 19:39.469
combined with enthusiasm
for the Rwandan gorilla,

19:39.635 --> 19:41.304
that set me thinking about the monkey.

19:45.391 --> 19:50.229
- I'm not sure I'm following you.
- I'm going too fast. I'll go slower.

19:50.396 --> 19:54.275
I figured out that,
if Brisbane could teach a monkey

19:54.442 --> 19:56.527
to impersonate Washington,

19:56.694 --> 20:00.114
then he could teach a monkey
to cock a revolver,

20:00.281 --> 20:04.493
sneak up a fire escape, pump Helen
full of lead, then get away,

20:04.660 --> 20:09.457
perhaps wearing revolutionary
war regalia to confuse witnesses.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.545
In fact - and this is way out there - but...

20:16.172 --> 20:19.550
check if there were
any local bank robberies at the time,

20:19.717 --> 20:23.846
committed by a short, hairy man
wearing a powdered wig.

20:26.557 --> 20:29.310
You think the monkey was the killer?

20:30.144 --> 20:32.646
When I said I was next to him,

20:32.813 --> 20:36.066
I was really most of the way
across the room.

20:38.402 --> 20:41.905
- Well, wasn't he?
- No, it was Shelby.

20:43.032 --> 20:46.744
- Who's Shelby?
- A cop. He was in love with Helen.

20:48.037 --> 20:49.872
Oh.

20:50.873 --> 20:53.542
Well, that was my second choice.

20:57.838 --> 21:01.175
- Can I freshen anyone's drink?
- Help me out, Frasier.

21:01.341 --> 21:04.303
What was the monkey's motive?

21:05.596 --> 21:10.267
Jealousy? Or maybe he just did it
for the insurance money?

21:10.475 --> 21:15.063
Hey! Do you think we should
put a tail on that monkey?

21:15.230 --> 21:19.192
Listen, if that monkey did it,
he'll swing for this.

21:20.610 --> 21:24.948
- Yes, that's all very funny.
- You can take a joke, can't you?

21:25.115 --> 21:27.284
I suppose I can, yes.

21:27.492 --> 21:31.580
Wait! I've got one!
Who will the monkey get to defend him?

21:31.747 --> 21:33.582
Clarence Darrow!

21:38.211 --> 21:40.672
The Scopes monkey trial.

21:42.215 --> 21:44.718
You know,
Darwin's theory of evolution.

21:44.885 --> 21:50.140
It was turned into a Pulitzer prize
winning novel "Inherit the Wind".

21:54.227 --> 21:56.604
Is that gun loaded?

22:05.488 --> 22:10.493
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.660 --> 22:12.537
# Oh, my!

22:12.704 --> 22:19.586
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:19.752 --> 22:26.342
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.509 --> 22:29.178
# They're calling again

22:29.345 --> 22:32.307
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:32.473 --> 22:34.517
# What is a boy to do? #

22:36.019 --> 22:39.564
Good night everybody!
