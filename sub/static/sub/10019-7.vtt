00:06.623 --> 00:08.591
<i>Previously on</i> ER...

00:13.930 --> 00:18.594
- What's your name?
- Gail. She's 10 days. Is she okay?

00:18.735 --> 00:21.932
Pulse ox is falling. You need
to get this baby off the table.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.437
- I'm getting Keaton.
- No.

00:24.641 --> 00:30.079
- I don't want you near my patients.
- I don't need your approval.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.480
If the baby dies, it's
my responsibility but your fault.

00:45.195 --> 00:47.925
- Hi, Mark.
- Hi, Susan.

00:48.098 --> 00:51.864
Excuse me? You just called me Susan.

00:52.001 --> 00:56.335
- No, I didn't.
- You did. Guess she's on your mind.

00:56.506 --> 01:00.966
- Not necessarily.
- I wish you could just get married.

01:01.177 --> 01:05.078
You're perfect for each other.
You almost went on vacation together.

01:05.281 --> 01:08.375
- You knew about that?
- Everybody knew.

01:08.551 --> 01:13.113
- Why did you back out?
- She didn't want me to go.

01:13.289 --> 01:19.524
- She wanted you to go.
- Did she? Nobody told me.

01:19.696 --> 01:23.826
Just do us a favor and ask her out.
We need some fresh gossip.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.527
Oh, man! I need some sleep.

01:26.703 --> 01:30.161
You? At least you get off
in 11 hours. I've got 18 to go.

01:30.373 --> 01:34.673
- Where's Benton? Still in the ER?
- No, still where he's been lately.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.837
- Still with that baby?
- The man is obsessed.

01:39.048 --> 01:41.710
Damn it, Edson!
I told you to keep an eye on him.

01:41.885 --> 01:45.821
That's what I told the nurses.
He's probably in the cafeteria.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.684
He better not have eaten.

01:47.857 --> 01:52.226
Have you seen a male patient
about this tall, kind of peculiar?

01:52.395 --> 01:54.829
- Lost one?
- Great case.

01:55.165 --> 01:58.532
Guy's got a big tumor in his throat.
He needs esophagectomy.

01:58.668 --> 02:03.696
Anspaugh brought some hotshot from
Japan, and the patient goes AWOL.

02:03.907 --> 02:06.535
You guys help me find him,
and I'll get you in on the surgery.

02:06.743 --> 02:09.143
- We'll keep our eyes open.
- Thanks.

02:09.312 --> 02:14.409
He's got a sweet tooth,
so check the vending machines.

02:14.584 --> 02:17.610
Last shift, he left me
three lines to change.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.721
I had to pick up his labs.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.255
- Have you had breakfast yet?
- I'm starving.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.465
- You paged me?
- Her abdomen is distended.

02:38.675 --> 02:41.974
She's hemorrhaging. We need
to take her off the anticoagulants.

02:42.145 --> 02:45.376
- Take her off the machine.
- Can she live off it?

02:45.548 --> 02:48.039
I doubt she'll last the day,
but there's no other choice.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.652
- We should take her to the O.R.
- Her platelets are too low.

02:50.820 --> 02:53.186
- Then we gotta transfuse her.
- We just did.

02:53.356 --> 02:55.290
We got to try something.

02:55.458 --> 02:59.121
At this point, the best thing we can do
is to do nothing.

02:59.295 --> 03:04.631
I also think that for the time being,
you should be more of an observer.

03:06.002 --> 03:09.335
- You mean on this case?
- On all the cases.

03:11.541 --> 03:17.173
Dr. Keaton, I'd do anything
to undo what I did. But I can't.

03:17.347 --> 03:20.942
This isn't a punishment,
but you tend to act without thinking.

03:21.117 --> 03:25.178
If you want to grow as a surgeon,
you got to learn more patience.

04:18.975 --> 04:21.569
Hear ye. Hear ye. Who wants taffy?

04:21.778 --> 04:25.339
- Homemade, per chance?
- Saltwater. Pulled it myself.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.814
- Don't mind if I do.
- Excuse me.

04:28.985 --> 04:32.386
Do you have change
for the candy machine?

04:32.555 --> 04:36.389
- Let me see. Quarters okay?
- Yes.

04:37.660 --> 04:42.324
- Excuse me, cuz. You owe me a buck.
- I don't have one.

04:42.498 --> 04:45.058
Then you're SOL.

04:45.935 --> 04:49.098
- Conni's sick. Call in a float.
- I already did.

04:49.272 --> 04:51.570
Call them back. I want
to approve whoever they send.

04:51.774 --> 04:56.211
Can someone call Security? There's
a man urinating in the phone booth.

04:56.412 --> 04:58.039
- That's why.
- Did anyone hear me?

04:58.214 --> 05:01.741
Yes, but you don't need Security.
You need a mop.

05:01.918 --> 05:04.386
I don't mop.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.285
- Way to go, Jerry.
- How was I supposed to know?

05:10.493 --> 05:14.953
I wonder how long we can sit here
before anyone notices we're missing.

05:15.131 --> 05:18.760
- You just jinxed it.
- What do you mean?

05:19.736 --> 05:23.263
- That's what I mean.
- It's Benton.

05:24.173 --> 05:26.198
Couldn't happen to a nicer...

05:27.543 --> 05:30.103
- What's that?
- The ER.

05:30.313 --> 05:33.009
- Do you want to trade?
- No way.

05:34.784 --> 05:39.778
Hi, John. I got that review article
you dropped off on congenital hernias.

05:39.956 --> 05:42.891
I heard you were doing one.
I didn't know if you had read it.

05:43.059 --> 05:46.893
- I actually helped edit it.
- Oh! Well, then...

05:47.063 --> 05:49.463
It was very sweet of you.

05:50.466 --> 05:51.694
See you.

05:58.908 --> 06:02.435
- Anything I should know about?
- Please!

06:06.516 --> 06:09.417
And when was
your last bowel movement?

06:09.585 --> 06:13.817
Technically, that would've been
Monday afternoon.

06:13.990 --> 06:19.792
Which is a little unusual for me.
I'm a morning person.

06:19.962 --> 06:24.558
And then sometimes in the evening,
I pass a little gas.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.861
Gas in the evening.

06:27.036 --> 06:31.632
- We don't take lengthy histories here.
- I believe in being thorough.

06:31.841 --> 06:35.436
When the patient is in for an extended
stay, that may be appropriate.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.206
- But down here, we keep it short.
- That's not the way I do things.

06:39.382 --> 06:42.249
The longer it takes, the longer
the patient waits in distress.

06:42.418 --> 06:46.411
That's all right.
We were having a nice little chat.

06:46.589 --> 06:48.557
Anything else?

06:51.961 --> 06:56.330
- Where were we?
- Gas in the evenings.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.162
We'll need some saline, some 4.0 nylon
and a suture setup.

07:03.439 --> 07:07.102
I know the squirrels are cute, Arthur,
but I wouldn't try petting one again.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.437
He was trying to eat it.

07:11.614 --> 07:14.276
- You all right, Wendy?
- It's not me.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.091
- He's choking!
- His airways are blocked.

07:24.427 --> 07:27.225
It's my taffy!
It was meant for the staff.

07:27.396 --> 07:30.888
He's dying, Wendy! Do you want
to give me a hand? One, two, three!

07:34.737 --> 07:37.638
There's more.
How much did you make?

07:37.840 --> 07:41.037
Get a McGill and hook up the suction.
Arthur, go to the waiting room.

07:44.113 --> 07:46.581
What's a patient from Surgical
doing here?

07:46.782 --> 07:52.015
Call upstairs. I think we just found
Dale's AWOL patient.

07:53.623 --> 07:56.023
- Where do you want him?
- What's this?

07:56.192 --> 07:58.990
13-year-old. Full arrest.
Took two bullets to chest and belly.

07:59.162 --> 08:02.188
- How long has he been down?
- 15 minutes. No signs of life.

08:02.365 --> 08:05.596
Let's transfer him over.
Give me 4 units of O-negative.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.929
On my count. One, two, three.

08:12.108 --> 08:15.009
- Here's one entry.
- What happened?

08:15.178 --> 08:17.840
- Some gang thing.
- He's a banger.

08:18.014 --> 08:20.244
Flatline.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.850
- How long was he down?
- 5 to 10 minutes.

08:23.019 --> 08:25.715
- Anyone give him CPR?
- No.

08:25.888 --> 08:29.255
- So he was down for 20 minutes?
- At least.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.952
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
This kid is dead. Very dead.

08:33.129 --> 08:35.620
- Calling it?
- Yes.

08:36.499 --> 08:39.467
Time of death: 8:26.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.162
This the GSW?

08:44.373 --> 08:47.706
- He's been down for 20 minutes.
- Giving up on him?

08:47.877 --> 08:50.402
There was no sign of life
in the field.

08:52.248 --> 08:54.808
Lydia, start bagging him.
Thoracotomy tray.

08:54.984 --> 08:57.976
- Peter, I called it.
- Let's get a cutdown on the ankles.

08:58.154 --> 09:02.750
This kid has been down for 20 minutes.
His brain is mush.

09:02.925 --> 09:05.257
- Ten-blade.
- His parents don't want him opened.

09:05.428 --> 09:09.592
- They want us to do our best.
- Lydia, go get Mark.

09:09.765 --> 09:13.132
Put the O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Rib-spreader!

09:13.269 --> 09:16.966
- God, it's like rubber!
- It's all the cornstarch.

09:17.173 --> 09:19.107
Scissors.

09:24.113 --> 09:27.708
Yes. I think it is coming loose.

09:28.851 --> 09:33.788
- What are you doing to my patient?
- He swallowed two pounds of taffy.

09:34.223 --> 09:35.690
Here it is!

09:38.094 --> 09:43.031
Shame on you, Mr. Percy. You're
not supposed to eat before surgery.

09:43.199 --> 09:46.362
- Nothing can get past that tumor.
- We need to move.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.992
Let's take him up.

09:54.977 --> 09:56.911
Hey, Dale. Remember me?

09:57.113 --> 10:00.207
Oh, yes. I'd ask you to join us,
but we're a little crowded.

10:00.383 --> 10:03.546
We can make room.
After all, Carter saved your keister.

10:03.719 --> 10:07.883
- Did you consent Mr. Percy?
- Yes. All that's left is an art line.

10:08.057 --> 10:10.287
Carter, do the line.
Edson, prep the O.R.

10:10.459 --> 10:16.125
Dr. Okida likes the temperature
to be 67 degrees.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.831
- Got the O-neg running?
- Two lines, wide open.

10:20.002 --> 10:22.766
- What's the story?
- Kid was down 20 minutes. I called it.

10:22.938 --> 10:25.236
- Peter's now playing God.
- He was out in the cold.

10:25.441 --> 10:29.969
- He's started, might as well finish.
- The kid is dead.

10:30.179 --> 10:34.548
He was my patient.
I assessed him as unsalvageable.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.016
He's not just your patient, Doug.

10:38.187 --> 10:40.087
High-dose epi.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.722
Start internal massage.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.724
Like this?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.363
- Anything?
- Still flatline.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.568
He jumped.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.175
- He's got a rhythm.
- That's the epi, not his heart.

11:02.545 --> 11:05.412
- That's more than the epi.
- You got him back.

11:05.581 --> 11:09.950
- His heart's back. His head's dead.
- You don't know that.

11:10.119 --> 11:13.486
Call the O.R. Tell them
we're on our way. Here we go, people.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.823
Let's move. Thanks, Haleh.
Here we go.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.533
- Hello, Dr. Lewis.
- What's the matter, E-Ray?

11:32.742 --> 11:35.302
- I just don't feel like myself.
- Fever?

11:35.511 --> 11:40.972
No, but I had an MRI yesterday
on my shoulder. An old conga injury.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.916
And ever since I just feel off.
Could it be radiation sickness?

11:45.087 --> 11:48.056
MRIs aren't radioactive. They
just scramble your electrons a bit.

11:48.224 --> 11:51.352
- Forever?
- No, just for a few seconds.

11:51.527 --> 11:55.554
That's odd. My watch stopped.

11:55.731 --> 11:58.165
- Oh, my God!
- What?

11:58.300 --> 12:04.330
My watch stopped last night. Right
after the MRI. And the toaster.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.940
- What toaster?
- My toaster.

12:07.109 --> 12:12.376
It shorted out this morning.
I've had that toaster for 10 years.

12:12.548 --> 12:15.984
Could the MRI have rearranged
my molecules, causing me...

12:16.152 --> 12:19.519
...to radiate some sort of bizarre
electronic interference?

12:19.688 --> 12:22.714
No. Follow the light with your eyes.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.962
What light?

12:28.097 --> 12:30.031
That's funny.

12:32.802 --> 12:34.064
What have we got?

12:34.236 --> 12:37.672
13-year-old GSW to abdomen
and pulmonary artery.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.398
Got his heart back in the ER.

12:39.608 --> 12:42.543
- Down time?
- 15 minutes.

12:43.779 --> 12:47.579
Closer to 20. But he was out
in the cold, so we can save his brain.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.947
- Giving odds?
- Dr. Greene agreed to keep trying.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.554
This could take all day.

12:53.722 --> 12:57.590
- He's bleeding from the belly.
- I'd go for a midline incision.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.662
- I thought I was supposed to observe.
- I'll make an exception.

13:01.831 --> 13:03.822
It's all yours.

13:05.568 --> 13:08.935
All right. Mark 9:35 as start time.

13:11.774 --> 13:15.107
- Mark, we've got a 10-foot-fall.
- Where from?

13:15.277 --> 13:18.212
A tree.
Taking pictures in Grant Park.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.747
- Dizzy? Nauseous?
- Dizzy, yes. Nauseous, no.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.511
- What were you taking pictures of?
- Birds.

13:24.687 --> 13:28.555
- Haven't they gone south?
- Not the ones I'm interested in.

13:29.792 --> 13:34.820
Seems okay to me. Why don't you
take her to Curtain Area 2?

13:43.138 --> 13:46.574
- Susan.
- Hi.

13:46.775 --> 13:49.209
You want to go out tonight?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.610
Yes, sure. I'd love to.

13:54.783 --> 13:57.217
But I can't.
I have something planned.

13:58.721 --> 14:01.656
- So you can't.
- I guess not.

14:04.994 --> 14:08.054
- Maybe some other time.
- Sure.

14:09.865 --> 14:11.799
We need to talk.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.768
Dr. Lewis?
Dr. Morgenstern is on the line.

14:16.672 --> 14:18.469
I'll call you tonight.

14:23.612 --> 14:27.139
Okay, Mr. Percy. We need...

14:28.183 --> 14:29.844
Mr. Percy?

14:40.129 --> 14:43.496
- Mr. Percy?
- Who's there?

14:43.666 --> 14:45.896
It's Dr. Carter.

14:48.370 --> 14:51.931
I take it you have some reservations
about the surgery.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.506
Do you have change
for the candy machine?

14:53.842 --> 14:55.969
You can't eat
with the tumor in your throat.

14:56.178 --> 15:00.080
Eloise put a Hershey bar
in the blender, and I drank it.

15:00.249 --> 15:02.979
Do you know that you're about
to have an operation?

15:03.152 --> 15:05.416
There's no blender here. I asked.

15:08.524 --> 15:11.015
Has someone
gone over the risks with you?

15:11.193 --> 15:14.993
Another time, she blended up Snickers.

15:17.533 --> 15:23.563
The trouble was that the nougat
got caught in the straw.

15:34.717 --> 15:38.915
- You ever have a Zagnut?
- I love Zagnuts.

15:39.088 --> 15:42.023
- They're my favorites.
- Mine too.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.459
Mr. Percy, do you want
to have this operation?

15:53.335 --> 15:56.702
Can I just have change
for the candy machine?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.077
Is it ready?

16:08.951 --> 16:10.543
- Not quite.
- What are you doing?

16:10.719 --> 16:14.280
- Mixing an enema. "White and brown."
- Milk and molasses.

16:14.456 --> 16:17.983
- Did a doctor order this?
- I know when it's needed.

16:18.160 --> 16:22.460
We give people an enema in a box. We
don't spend time mixing up a recipe.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.997
- I do.
- Not anymore.

16:25.668 --> 16:28.535
I'll take over.
Change the beds in Exam 4.

16:28.704 --> 16:31.867
- You can't do this.
- I'm the charge nurse.

16:32.074 --> 16:37.137
- I don't want a new nurse.
- You're in luck. You can go home.

16:37.346 --> 16:39.371
Where are your clothes?

16:51.126 --> 16:53.219
Hello.

16:53.395 --> 16:57.559
Your CT is fine.
I don't see any birds in here.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.830
I let you in on a secret.
I'm more than just a bird watcher.

17:02.004 --> 17:04.905
I'm a comparative anthropologist
doing field study...

17:05.107 --> 17:08.770
...on the mating rituals
of man and bird.

17:08.977 --> 17:12.913
- Sounds interesting.
- Yes. Take those two over there.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.175
Notice the occasional
lateral-body contact...

17:16.351 --> 17:21.345
...initiated by her,
and then reciprocated by him.

17:21.522 --> 17:26.050
Identical to the courtship dance
of the sharp-tailed grouse.

17:28.897 --> 17:30.524
Check out the two at the desk.

17:30.699 --> 17:34.135
Do you see how he puffs his chest
and strokes his goatee?

17:34.269 --> 17:37.238
Same as the slender-billed shearwater.

17:37.406 --> 17:39.840
- Look at that!
- What?

17:40.008 --> 17:43.273
- Her frontal-neck presentation.
- What does that mean?

17:43.445 --> 17:48.382
In the nuthatch, it's an invitation
to love. She is shameless!

17:48.584 --> 17:51.985
See how she strokes her throat
with her finger?

17:52.154 --> 17:58.093
The spoonbill would bend over and
shake her tail feathers in his face.

18:00.129 --> 18:03.326
I need some moist lap pads
to pack off the liver.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.765
Bad news for the gallbladder.
A bullet tore through the common duct.

18:07.903 --> 18:10.531
- What's your plan?
- Pack and stitch off liver...

18:10.706 --> 18:13.436
...put in 3 or 4 Jackson-Pratts,
move on to the gallbladder.

18:13.642 --> 18:16.577
Sounds good. I'd love to stay,
but I have a cystic hygroma.

18:16.779 --> 18:19.714
Is Dr. Maxwell available to supervise?

18:19.915 --> 18:24.682
He's resecting a bowel,
but Dr. Breedlove is around.

18:24.853 --> 18:29.415
- Breedlove would be perfect.
- 3.0 on a needle. Let's move!

18:32.394 --> 18:37.957
- Did my blood test come back?
- Not yet. Damn.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.660
The computer just went down.

18:44.306 --> 18:46.968
Why don't you have a seat right there?

18:47.843 --> 18:52.212
Here's your aftercare,
your prescription and your enema.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.373
- Instructions are inside.
- I know all about them.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.042
Someone from the home will
be here any minute.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.780
I'll believe that when I see it.

19:07.863 --> 19:11.230
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Do you see what I see?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.596
Susan's talking to Morgenstern.
So what?

19:14.770 --> 19:19.605
He's stroking himself, puffing out his
chest like a slender-billed something.

19:19.808 --> 19:23.369
She's giving him full frontal neck.

19:23.579 --> 19:28.482
- What are you talking about?
- You'd know if you were a nuthatch.

19:28.650 --> 19:33.314
- Mark, are you okay?
- She turned me down.

19:33.488 --> 19:35.217
- Susan?
- Now I know why.

19:35.390 --> 19:38.086
- Oh, God! She's stroking her neck.
- So?

19:38.260 --> 19:43.459
Why doesn't she just bend over and
shake her tail feathers in his face?

19:45.467 --> 19:48.334
- Did you consent Mr. Percy?
- Yes, why?

19:48.503 --> 19:52.701
He couldn't reiterate the risks to me.
He only wants to talk about chocolate.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.570
He's just in denial.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.611
This is a high-risk procedure on
a guy that can't carry a conversation.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.148
- He signed the consent.
- He's not qualified to make decisions.

20:03.318 --> 20:07.812
- Let's get a shrink down here.
- You want to delay the surgery...

20:07.990 --> 20:12.393
...because you aren't comfortable
with the patient's mental status?

20:12.561 --> 20:16.793
I'll get a stat Psych consult. If he
agrees with me, I'll tell Anspaugh.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.368
- What happened?
- Doug tried to explain things...

20:21.536 --> 20:24.164
...and the guy just went bozo.

20:24.373 --> 20:26.933
- It's a scratch on his finger!
- A serious infection.

20:27.142 --> 20:31.977
- Who are you to tell me what to do?
- I'm his doctor.

20:32.147 --> 20:37.141
The boy has an infected human bite.
The father refuses to let me treat him.

20:37.319 --> 20:42.382
- It's a free country. We want to go.
- Hold on. Can I see the x-ray?

20:45.093 --> 20:48.187
The infection could be in the joint.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.422
Let me see you guys outside.

20:50.565 --> 20:52.829
We'll be right with you.

20:56.371 --> 21:00.330
- He could loose his finger.
- There's no signs of osteomyelitis.

21:00.542 --> 21:05.775
- The dad won't come back with him.
- IV is the best way to go.

21:05.948 --> 21:10.009
But we shouldn't call the police if he
can be treated with oral antibiotics.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.915
Fine. You do what you want.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.249
- Psych consult come down?
- Still waiting.

21:17.426 --> 21:20.088
- Time's up.
- Mr. Percy.

21:20.829 --> 21:24.788
Do you want to go through
with this surgery or not?

21:24.933 --> 21:27.663
Can I have change
for the candy machine?

21:28.370 --> 21:31.828
- Art line in?
- It's in.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.474
- Let's take him, Oki.
- Okey-dokey.

21:34.676 --> 21:39.773
Dr. Anspaugh, the patient is more
interested in candy than surgery.

21:39.948 --> 21:45.477
Don't worry. You can have all the
candy you want when the tumor is out.

21:46.421 --> 21:48.548
Coming, John?

21:51.860 --> 21:57.093
- I'm due for my break.
- We don't take scheduled breaks.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.223
It's in the contract.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.167
Is a little flexibility
too much to ask?

22:03.405 --> 22:06.772
Whose patient is she?

22:06.975 --> 22:09.375
She's been discharged
to her nursing home.

22:09.544 --> 22:13.674
They won't take her.
She just had an accident.

22:13.849 --> 22:18.377
The loose, runny kind
that makes a puddle on the floor.

22:19.921 --> 22:23.084
I believe the mop is over there.

22:24.826 --> 22:28.489
- More O-chromic on a liver needle.
- Cut.

22:28.663 --> 22:30.130
Box!

22:35.737 --> 22:39.639
You Benton? Sam Breedlove.
Where are we?

22:39.808 --> 22:44.711
Finished pneumonectomy. Almost
done with liver. Gallbladder to go.

22:44.913 --> 22:49.941
Take wider bites,
and don't tie so tight.

22:50.118 --> 22:53.417
- More 3.0 Vicryl.
- Good stuff, Vicryl.

22:53.588 --> 22:56.421
- Closest thing to catgut.
- Surgeons still use that?

22:56.591 --> 23:01.187
Not these days. It's a shame.
Nothing ties like catgut.

23:01.363 --> 23:05.129
- Got a bleeder.
- Is it new?

23:05.267 --> 23:08.998
- Where is it coming from?
- Aorta.

23:09.571 --> 23:13.507
We got a pumper.
Put your finger on it!

23:13.675 --> 23:16.542
- Statinski.
- I got it.

23:16.711 --> 23:19.680
- Clamps here.
- Clamps.

23:19.881 --> 23:23.612
- Still falling.
- D Ábride hole and sew.

23:23.785 --> 23:27.221
- Vascular needle now.
- Internal paddles.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.720
Charging 20. Clear.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.959
- Still in fib.
- Charging 30.

23:36.131 --> 23:39.931
- No change.
- Charging 40. Clear.

23:42.971 --> 23:47.738
- Still at it?
- Lot of work to save an organ donor.

23:47.943 --> 23:51.902
- Wait! Lost it.
- Charging 40. Clear.

23:54.316 --> 23:58.150
Charging. Clear! 50.

24:00.755 --> 24:05.089
- Susan and Morgenstern?
- It makes sense.

24:05.260 --> 24:08.957
She's been preoccupied lately,
distracted, avoiding me.

24:09.131 --> 24:13.067
I did see her and Morgenstern
having lunch the other day.

24:13.201 --> 24:16.967
See? I waited too long.
That's my chance. Blew it.

24:17.472 --> 24:22.535
- Can't believe we got him back.
- Kid's got good protoplasm.

24:22.744 --> 24:27.374
Set him up for an apnea test.
See if he's got any brain left.

24:28.783 --> 24:32.685
- Do you think he's got a chance?
- He's made it this far.

24:32.854 --> 24:35.982
Dr. Benton? The boy's mother.

24:37.526 --> 24:39.858
Do you want to talk to her?

24:40.028 --> 24:44.988
Not yet. I want to assess
his brain function first.

24:46.501 --> 24:51.131
- I will talk to her.
- Don't get her hopes up.

24:51.306 --> 24:55.504
- How's the Herlihy baby?
- Still alive the last time I checked.

25:01.816 --> 25:03.681
My foot!

25:03.852 --> 25:07.344
Sal Urbanski. Playing football
in the street, went for man in Buick.

25:07.522 --> 25:11.185
Right foot ripped off at the ankle.
In shock. Lost a liter at the scene.

25:11.359 --> 25:13.020
- Where's the foot?
- Between his legs.

25:13.195 --> 25:18.929
- Why is he holding a football?
- It's his lucky ball.

25:19.100 --> 25:23.969
Let's get 6 units O-neg,
CBC, type and cross.

25:24.139 --> 25:28.132
On my count. One, two, three.

25:29.211 --> 25:31.736
Get his foot on ice.

25:32.647 --> 25:36.606
Someone call Vascular
and page the Reimplantation team.

25:37.319 --> 25:40.914
Stand by with morphine, 4 mgs.

25:41.089 --> 25:45.150
The pressure dressing isn't working.
I need a thigh cuff.

25:45.327 --> 25:47.591
Thank you.

25:49.731 --> 25:55.169
Oki is freeing up the esophagus
posteriorly with his fingers.

25:55.303 --> 25:59.501
Dale, you're in a position
to displace it laterally.

25:59.708 --> 26:03.269
- I can free it up anteriorly.
- You stick to suction, Carter.

26:03.478 --> 26:08.609
- I can feel it coming loose.
- Suction. Suction!

26:08.783 --> 26:13.447
As Oki cuts along sternocleidomastoid
down towards the carotid sheath...

26:13.622 --> 26:17.922
...what should he watch out for?
- Not to nick any arteries?

26:18.093 --> 26:20.687
- Dale?
- The vagus nerve...

26:20.862 --> 26:25.526
...that runs through the sheath.
- Very good. Dale is smart.

26:30.472 --> 26:34.203
Those little bubbles on the lung
normal?

26:34.409 --> 26:38.903
Those little bubbles there,
where Dale just moved the esophagus.

26:39.114 --> 26:42.447
- You tore the lung pleura.
- I didn't feel it tear.

26:42.617 --> 26:46.075
Congratulations, you've just given
Mr. Percy a pneumothorax.

26:46.254 --> 26:49.917
- I can put in a chest tube.
- Yes, do that now.

26:50.091 --> 26:54.152
Dale, can you hold this for me,
please?

26:54.329 --> 26:56.729
Scalpel.

27:00.302 --> 27:04.068
- Chest tube. Thirty-two French.
- Scissors.

27:06.808 --> 27:10.767
- Got it.
- That was a nice catch, Carter.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.140
- Where is my suction?
- I'm sorry.

27:19.387 --> 27:23.050
- Give me the football, sir.
- Don't lose it. Ditka signed it.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.158
I'll put it with your clothes.

27:25.327 --> 27:28.319
- BP down to 60.
- Let's get another line going.

27:28.496 --> 27:30.828
Start the rapid infuser.

27:30.965 --> 27:33.627
Someone called for
a vascular surgeon?

27:33.802 --> 27:38.933
- It's about time.
- Don't get fresh with me, lassie.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.973
- Ice is here.
- Put it on the foot.

27:46.314 --> 27:49.078
- I'm in trouble.
- Can't find a vein?

27:49.250 --> 27:52.413
- No. Itchy in my mush.
- Your mustache?

27:52.587 --> 27:57.388
Would you be so kind? Left side,
near my nose. That's my spot.

27:58.993 --> 28:01.587
- That's my spot.
- Want me to help you?

28:01.763 --> 28:06.325
- No. Susan's got it. I'm in.
- Hook it up.

28:06.468 --> 28:10.461
Let's get him upstairs.
The Reimplantion team awaits.

28:10.638 --> 28:13.607
- Have we got the foot?
- Right here.

28:13.808 --> 28:16.276
- See you later.
- Yes.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.742
Dr. Benton, the boy's
mother wanted to watch.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.323
- I said I had to come and ask you.
- All right.

28:31.993 --> 28:34.461
Tell her to come in.

28:38.833 --> 28:43.896
- This is Mrs. Dorset.
- I'm Dr. Benton.

28:44.906 --> 28:50.310
I took him off the ventilator to test
if his brain'll trigger him to breathe.

28:50.478 --> 28:54.175
- I don't understand.
- Lf we see your son take a breath...

28:54.349 --> 28:58.149
...that means that his brain functions
are intact.

28:58.319 --> 29:03.018
If there's no attempt to breathe in,
that's a sign of brain death.

29:03.191 --> 29:05.625
PCO-2 is 60.

29:07.462 --> 29:11.159
- It's high enough to make him breathe.
- How long will it take?

29:11.299 --> 29:14.097
We'll know in 10 seconds.

29:36.758 --> 29:38.487
I'm sorry.

29:58.947 --> 30:01.711
You wanted to see me?

30:01.883 --> 30:05.717
Yes, I did.
How many shifts do you work a week?

30:05.887 --> 30:07.752
- Four?
- Usually.

30:07.922 --> 30:12.621
As long as we don't work
the same four, we'll get along great.

30:12.794 --> 30:16.321
- Is this about the kid's finger?
- You don't respect my decisions.

30:16.498 --> 30:19.331
You can't take professional
differences personal.

30:19.467 --> 30:23.995
It is personal. You have been Mr.
Moral since I came in with that OD.

30:24.172 --> 30:28.700
What do you expect when you drag
your dirty laundry through the door?

30:30.011 --> 30:32.445
But it's not personal, right?

30:33.915 --> 30:36.475
Who are you kidding?

30:43.758 --> 30:48.024
Mrs. Urbanski, the surgeons are
trying to reattach your husbands foot.

30:48.196 --> 30:52.394
- But is he all right?
- He lost blood, but he will be fine.

30:52.534 --> 30:55.162
- Here's his stuff.
- Thank you.

30:55.336 --> 30:58.134
He seemed concerned
about his Mike Ditka football.

30:58.306 --> 31:03.300
- He loves the Bears.
- I'll find someone to bring you up.

31:03.511 --> 31:08.608
Wendy? Can you bring Mrs. Urbanski
up to Surgery for me?

31:13.888 --> 31:16.584
- How are we doing?
- Ready when you are.

31:20.762 --> 31:24.664
- Let's bring in the foot.
- What the hell...?

31:31.406 --> 31:34.898
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.245
In and out in two hours.
Oki's amazing.

31:43.418 --> 31:46.945
- I'm glad you invited me along.
- I'm glad we did.

31:47.121 --> 31:49.180
Otherwise we might not have seen
the pneumothorax.

31:49.357 --> 31:54.021
- Want to eat before my flight?
- Lf you're buying.

31:54.195 --> 31:58.529
Why don't you join us, Carter?
Edson, monitor Mr. Percy in Recovery.

32:03.104 --> 32:05.095
It was an honest mistake.

32:05.306 --> 32:10.369
It was incompetent. And because you
didn't ice it, it can't be reattached.

32:10.578 --> 32:14.412
- Please don't write me up.
- Lf anyone deserves that, it's you.

32:14.582 --> 32:18.211
Do the dirty work for them.
That's what they want.

32:18.386 --> 32:21.082
Whose dirty work?

32:22.390 --> 32:27.953
Hospital Administration. I'm nine
months from getting maximum pension.

32:28.129 --> 32:32.122
That's why I'm sent
where I don't know what I'm doing.

32:32.266 --> 32:35.326
They want to get rid of people like me
to get cheaper aides.

32:35.503 --> 32:38.836
If they know the difference between
a football and a foot, I'll take them.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.306
I will not let you put me through
the humiliation of a review board.

32:43.478 --> 32:47.209
- Not after 22 years.
- Watch me.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.749
Don't bother. I quit.

33:19.981 --> 33:24.714
Dr. Keaton says that her oxygen level
is as low as it can go.

33:24.886 --> 33:27.252
It's only a matter of time.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.150
Thank you for everything
you have done for Megan.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.708
- What happened to the float?
- She quit, thank God.

33:50.878 --> 33:55.372
She said that Admin tried to make her
quit before her pension maxed out.

33:55.550 --> 34:01.750
- That's why she was floated down here.
- She gave me the same line.

34:01.923 --> 34:05.484
- They're floating me to Neuro.
- What?

34:05.660 --> 34:10.255
Starting tomorrow, the hospital's
floating me there three times a week.

34:10.431 --> 34:15.130
- When does your pension max out?
- In a year.

34:26.347 --> 34:28.975
So maybe it was personal.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.618
Go ahead and say it.
I'm a sanctimonious...

34:31.786 --> 34:36.655
...judgmental, self-righteous,
sexually frustrated, little man.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.690
- You're not little.
- Thank you.

34:41.195 --> 34:45.791
I hate to think that my personal pique
could color my professional decisions.

34:45.933 --> 34:50.893
But it happens. And it probably
happened today.

34:51.072 --> 34:56.704
You don't need to beat me up about
making a mess out of my life.

34:56.911 --> 34:59.471
I like to do that myself.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.548
That may not be
the healthiest approach.

35:03.718 --> 35:08.052
- I'm seeing a shrink.
- That's a good step.

35:09.857 --> 35:13.088
- Man or a woman?
- Woman.

35:13.261 --> 35:16.196
Don't worry. She's 62 years old.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.663
Freudian? Sorry, I couldn't resist.

35:21.135 --> 35:24.662
I hate you. You know that?

35:25.606 --> 35:26.630
I know.

35:28.209 --> 35:33.112
<i>When a whippoorwi</i>// <i>ca</i>//<i>s</i>
<i>And the evening is nigh</i>

35:33.314 --> 35:37.307
<i>I hurry to my blue heaven</i>

35:38.186 --> 35:43.522
<i>You'</i>// <i>see a smiling face</i>
<i>A fireplace, a cozy room</i>

35:43.691 --> 35:47.855

35:48.029 --> 35:53.160

35:53.301 --> 35:57.738
<i>We're happy in my blue heaven</i>

35:58.072 --> 36:00.267
Take it, Oki.

36:20.027 --> 36:22.052
Rough day?

36:23.865 --> 36:28.461
- You knew it would be, didn't you?
- I had an idea.

36:28.603 --> 36:34.564
I did exactly what you said.
Rushed ahead, didn't think.

36:37.812 --> 36:41.509
Did you actually believe
that you could save that boy?

36:43.918 --> 36:48.048
I never worked so hard or performed
more surgery than I did today.

36:50.358 --> 36:56.661
When I took that vent off, I actually
thought that kid would breathe.

37:03.271 --> 37:06.707
Did you check on the Herlihy baby?

37:06.908 --> 37:09.536
Couple of hours ago.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.745
I can't face those parents.

37:14.615 --> 37:17.846
You should check on her before you go.

37:25.159 --> 37:29.095
The guy walks in the room, and every
vending machine goes kaput.

37:29.263 --> 37:31.959
- I don't believe you.
- Jerry, I've got the keys.

37:32.099 --> 37:35.068
- Are we going through with this?
- Yes, I'm desperate.

37:35.236 --> 37:39.730
You are nuts. MRIs don't
cause negative force fields.

37:42.476 --> 37:44.444
I think we better take the stairs.

37:46.347 --> 37:50.477
Dale, my hale and hearty friend,
today was a blast.

37:50.651 --> 37:54.883
Not bad.
Too bad Mr. Percy stroked out.

37:55.056 --> 37:57.684
- What did you say?
- Didn't you hear?

37:57.858 --> 38:00.884
Went to check on him,
and he couldn't even talk.

38:01.062 --> 38:02.586
- You're kidding.
- No.

38:02.763 --> 38:04.856
Nothing left to do
but turn and water him.

38:04.999 --> 38:11.029
Shame you backed off on that Psych
consult. You could've saved his life.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.368
You smug son of a bitch!

38:17.011 --> 38:18.979
What the hell is going on here?

38:19.180 --> 38:22.411
We were just discussing
the finer points of informed consent.

38:22.583 --> 38:25.211
What is wrong with you guys?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.987
She and Morgenstern are going out.
I can live with that.

38:31.158 --> 38:34.457
What bothers me is that
she didn't tell me about it.

38:34.628 --> 38:38.223
If I was going out with Morgenstern,
I wouldn't tell anybody.

38:38.366 --> 38:43.030
Susan and I are supposed
to be friends. How did this happen?

38:43.204 --> 38:45.502
- How serious is it?
- Ask her.

38:45.706 --> 38:50.302
Do you want me to go to her and say,
"What's up with you and Morgenstern?"

38:50.511 --> 38:54.072
- That would be one way.
- That's not my style.

38:54.248 --> 38:57.911
Mark, you might want
to think about changing your style.

39:09.330 --> 39:12.458
Okay, E-Ray.
What's that key sequence?

39:12.600 --> 39:16.593
Control, A-Q-R,
and then push the pound key.

39:18.205 --> 39:22.073
- Hurry up. Someone's coming.
- Close the door.

39:27.815 --> 39:31.182
Okay, here goes.

39:31.752 --> 39:36.951
Control, A-Q-R, pound.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.789
Good job, Jerry.

39:42.963 --> 39:47.423
Don't leave me too long.
Fifteen minutes should be enough.

39:47.568 --> 39:51.026
This Radiology tech stuff
isn't so hard.

39:51.205 --> 39:56.108
I can feel the difference.
I'm me again. Now turn it off.

39:56.277 --> 40:00.338
- What's the sequence for that?
- Isn't there a switch?

40:00.514 --> 40:04.280
- Which one?
- There should be a kill switch.

40:04.452 --> 40:07.944
- A big, red button.
- What about this?

40:10.157 --> 40:13.183
- Oh, my God!
- Jerry, what are you doing?

40:13.360 --> 40:15.954
- I don't know!
- What are you doing?

40:16.130 --> 40:19.691
- I don't know!
- Pull the plug!

40:19.834 --> 40:22.701
- Oh, my God!
- Pull the plug!

40:24.238 --> 40:29.198
Medicine is supposed to be a noble
profession, not a motorcycle club.

40:30.544 --> 40:35.481
- Why were you fighting?
- It was stupid, Dr. Keaton.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.151
Abby. I'm listening.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.183
There was a patient scheduled
for high-risk surgery.

40:43.357 --> 40:46.292
Clearly not compos mentis.

40:46.460 --> 40:49.827
And I knew that I should've called
the Psych consult down to clear him.

40:49.964 --> 40:54.663
But I didn't. I was too afraid of...

40:54.835 --> 40:57.429
...pissing off the surgeons
to speak up.

40:57.605 --> 41:01.336
- What happened?
- He stroked out.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.943
He should never have had the surgery.
And I knew it.

41:05.112 --> 41:10.106
At least you care about your patients.
A lot of surgeons don't.

41:12.853 --> 41:14.548
They don't?

41:16.190 --> 41:19.489
- Dr. Keaton...
- Abby.

41:21.428 --> 41:23.396
Abby.

41:29.870 --> 41:32.270
- Who is it?
- It's Mark.

41:35.142 --> 41:37.940
- I just called you.
- Are you alone?

41:41.982 --> 41:45.281
So I'll make this easy.

41:46.554 --> 41:51.617
- I know about you and Morgenstern.
- You do?

41:52.660 --> 41:55.458
How long have you
been seeing each other?

41:57.464 --> 42:02.731
- You mean as in "going out"?
- Yes.

42:04.772 --> 42:09.038
- Mark, we're not.
- You're not?

42:09.777 --> 42:12.439
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.207
Are you seeing anybody?

42:19.186 --> 42:21.381
Maybe we should sit down.

42:34.301 --> 42:38.601
Morgenstern has been helping me
get my transcripts together.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.468
- I'm leaving my Residency.
- You're quitting?

42:41.675 --> 42:45.076
- Transferring.
- Where?

42:46.013 --> 42:48.106
Phoenix.

42:50.351 --> 42:53.184
When I was there
visiting Chloe and Susie...

42:53.354 --> 42:58.382
...I just got this feeling, like this
is where I'm supposed to be now.

42:59.893 --> 43:04.592
And I don't really have anything
here in Chicago.

43:07.067 --> 43:10.161
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.

43:12.806 --> 43:16.503
And after I've decided,
I just feel happy.

43:17.878 --> 43:24.716
For the first time in a long time.
I'm finally moving on with my life.

43:24.885 --> 43:27.581
That's great.

43:29.790 --> 43:34.386
God. So you're sure?

43:34.561 --> 43:37.394
Yes, I am.

43:40.267 --> 43:43.361
I don't know what to say.

43:54.915 --> 43:58.544
I know. I'm going to miss you.

44:01.989 --> 44:04.822
I'm going to miss you too.

44:24.845 --> 44:30.010
- Kit, is the pulse-ox monitor right?
- Yes, it is.

44:30.184 --> 44:31.981
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

44:32.152 --> 44:35.212
About an hour ago,
she just started getting better.

44:47.468 --> 44:49.834
It's a miracle.
