00:05.422 --> 00:06.673
Cobra, Cobra, Cobra.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.426
Cobra, Cobra, Cobra.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.847
Cobra!

00:14.139 --> 00:15.807
Destroy the Taj Mahal.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.143
Cobra!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.775
Not if G.I. Joe can help it.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.528
Roadblock, Deep Six,
hold off those H.I.S.S. Tanks.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.780
- Yo, Joe!
- Hat Muffs, Spit Take...

00:30.072 --> 00:31.865
shoot down those Rattlers.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.034
Eject!

00:34.326 --> 00:35.994
Excuse me, sir.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.248
Why is Cobra attacking a tourist
attraction with zero tactical value...

00:39.540 --> 00:41.976
and with all due respect to India,
why are we defending it?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.753
Tight Ship, you can overhaul G.I. Joe
when you're commander.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.838
Which will clearly happen
any day now...

00:47.130 --> 00:48.890
as long as your ♪♪♪♪
stay on full display.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.968
Whoa, Buzzkill, language.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.845
You can't have ice cream.
Put your brother on the phone.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.723
Three Kids, put down that phone.
We're in a battle.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.726
Screw you, Flint. I'm in a battle
called having three kids.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.188
We're a squad.
You're making me look bad.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.316
Well, if you're so great, Wingman,
show us how it's done.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.985
With pleasure.

01:14.116 --> 01:17.411
We'll meet again, G.I. Joe.

01:17.703 --> 01:20.372
Good shooting, but it looks like
Destro's getting away.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.915
Not necessarily, sir.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.250
Jeez!

01:24.835 --> 01:26.587
What? Oh, no.
What are you doing?

01:26.878 --> 01:27.878
Are you crazy?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.930
Yo, Joe!

01:39.600 --> 01:40.892
What?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.103
What, we're...
We're not saying it together?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.691

Wingman, Three Kids,

02:49.461 --> 02:51.004
you stand accused of violence...

02:51.296 --> 02:53.507
suggestive language,
and mature situations...

02:53.799 --> 02:56.343
unbecoming of G.I. Joe.
What say you?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.303
I understand
this is the first time...

02:58.595 --> 03:00.972
a G.I. Joe has killed anyone
in recorded history.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.683
- However...
- However, be truthful.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.351
This is a disorganized militia.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.644
What's anyone's rank?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.105
We're dressed like
serial killers and strippers.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.397
I have three kids.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.024
You guys are not helping.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.235
Duke, Flint, Scarlett...

03:13.527 --> 03:16.029
yes, it's true I killed Destro.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.531
I promise not to do it again.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.157
But is it really a crime?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.369
Is Cobra not a ruthless
terrorist organisation...

03:21.493 --> 03:24.371
determined to rule the world?
And if we never kill them...

03:24.663 --> 03:26.748
are we not basically
on their side?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.209
And won't this war
therefore last forever...

03:29.501 --> 03:31.128
unless we finish killing Cobra...

03:31.420 --> 03:33.004
or start killing ourselves?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.509
How long are we in here,
Cold Shoulder?

03:37.801 --> 03:40.178
Cold Shoulder?
What's with that guy?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.389
"Start killing Cobra
or killing ourselves"?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.558
We were in the fourth down.
It was a Hail Mary.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.185
This place is a graveyard
for G.I. Joe rejects.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.603
Look who's in here:

03:48.895 --> 03:50.480
Deep Dish, Shark Arms...

03:50.772 --> 03:52.274
Weird Head, Home Free...

03:52.566 --> 03:54.735
Place Holder, Sleep Apnea,
and us!

03:55.026 --> 03:57.571
I have three kids.
This is the worst day of my life.

03:57.863 --> 03:58.905
Is it life?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.200
My name is Fourth Wall.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.202
I believe what we perceive as life...

04:04.494 --> 04:07.581
is actually
a syndicated children's cartoon.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.833
What? Shut up, Fourth Wall.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.419
If this were a cartoon,
there'd be a word for "cartoon"...

04:12.711 --> 04:14.963
in our language,
which there isn't.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.591
There'd also be less movement, less
detail, constant lip-sync mistakes.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.928
What if I told you there was more,
a higher reality...

04:22.220 --> 04:24.765
with more than 65 colours,
at least three dimensions?

04:25.056 --> 04:28.435
Then someone would have to lock you
up with the crazy people. Oh, good.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.938
I recently infiltrated
a secret Cobra dig site...

04:32.230 --> 04:33.607
code name: Greendale.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.234
What did you say?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.988
Cobra has discovered
an ancient buried structure...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.532
filled with strange things.
Look.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.285
- Oh, yeah, look at that.
- It's a child's toy.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.662
The toy was more real
than this at Greendale.

04:49.164 --> 04:52.375
- What is that word?
- Greendale?

04:52.667 --> 04:56.963
Greendale, Greendale, Greendale...

05:03.011 --> 05:04.846
Cobra's out to take over the world...

05:05.138 --> 05:06.306
but G.I. Joe is there.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.974
G.I. Joe must be destroyed.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.684
Cobra H.I.S.S.
coming for attack!

05:09.976 --> 05:12.020
It's the new G.I. Joe Submachopter...

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
piloted by Wingman.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.649
- Retreat!
- Yo, Joe!

05:15.941 --> 05:17.234
We are in a toy commercial!

05:17.526 --> 05:19.653
I can't hear you when
you're covered in rocks.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.613
It doesn't hurt
because it isn't real.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.824
- Good job, Wingman.
- Thank you, Duke.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.700
G.I. Joe is my entire life.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.661
- Yo, Joe!
- Yo, Joe!

05:27.953 --> 05:30.080
All other figures
and vehicles sold separately.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.625
- Wingman, what happened?
- I don't know.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.003
He has a connection to the non-cartoon
reality. When I mentioned Greenda...

05:37.295 --> 05:38.672
Shut up. Stop saying that word.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.340
You're some kind of demon man.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.592
And your outfit is
three layers of racist.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.595
He's having an attack.
Jeff, can you hear us? It's Annie.

05:45.887 --> 05:46.887
What did you call me?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.138
Know where you are?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.641
Be quiet. Leave me alone.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.060
I don't belong here.
I belong in G.I. Joe.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.188
And don't touch me.
Who wears a saw on their arm?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.236
DAYS SINCE LAST CASUALTY:

06:01.528 --> 06:03.238
The first time I met Destro...

06:03.530 --> 06:07.534
he asked me if he should have
his entire head coated in chrome.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.411
I said, "No.
How would you do that?"

06:10.203 --> 06:12.455
How would that even work?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.457
Look, I'm not good at eulogies...

06:14.749 --> 06:16.501
because I've never had
to give one.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.046
All I want to know is,
how did G.I. Joe do this?

06:20.338 --> 06:24.009
We've been shooting at each other and
missing for 20 years. All of a sudden...

06:24.301 --> 06:26.052
Unbelievable. What?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.389
Cobra commander, it's vice Cobra
assistant commander.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.392
Got a very interesting
energy surge at the Greendale site.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.228
Oh, okay.
That's super fascinating.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.188
Destro's dead!

06:37.480 --> 06:40.358
Oh, my gosh, Destro?
Were you guys close?

06:40.650 --> 06:41.650
Were we close? Yes!

06:41.902 --> 06:43.028
What kind of a question...?

06:43.320 --> 06:46.031
Okay, fine. I loved him!

06:46.323 --> 06:47.866
Is that what you want to hear?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.200
Called it.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.745
And we are going to find out
how this happened...

06:52.037 --> 06:56.750
and G.I. Joe
is going to pay-bra!

06:57.042 --> 06:58.293
I riffed that.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.711
No wrong answers.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.964
It's a condition that comes on
when you get to a certain weight.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.426
- Oh, I see.
- So is there a Mr. Tight Ship, or...?

07:08.303 --> 07:11.222
That's a code three. Cobra
forces are infiltrating the base.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.434
Cobra!

07:14.726 --> 07:18.021
Avenge my totally
platonic friend!

07:19.481 --> 07:20.815
Great, we're stuck in here.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.192
We don't have to be.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.611
For 15 years, I used
my trademark tablespoon...

07:24.903 --> 07:26.529
to excavate a tunnel...

07:26.821 --> 07:29.616
swallowing handfuls of dirt
and rock with my meals...

07:29.908 --> 07:32.744
and listening only to Smash Mouth
to justify this poster.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.164
Now I am within inches
of reaching the...

07:36.456 --> 07:37.999
Come on,
if we help save the base...

07:38.291 --> 07:40.210
maybe they'll let us be
G.I. Joes again.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.129
Battle stations!

07:43.880 --> 07:46.132
Snakes at 6 o'clock.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.136
Okay, now remember,
don't kill anybody.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.847
Just lay down a suppressive fire,
like this.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.309
Sorry. Sorry.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.603
Oh, God.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
Oh, man. Oh, darn it.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.023
I'd say they're suppressed.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.527
Jeez. Was that Lifeline? Sorry!

08:05.860 --> 08:06.987
Someone's killing people.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.655
It's Wingman! He's escaped!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.740
Lay down a suppressive fire!

08:11.700 --> 08:13.159
They're suppressive-firing
at us!

08:13.451 --> 08:15.578
I think we'll be okay.
This is all a cartoon...

08:15.870 --> 08:18.190
- about action figures for kids.
- Shut up, Fourth Wall.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.958
Get into the G.I. Joe Submachopter...

08:20.250 --> 08:22.752
with twin rocket launchers
and rotating attack jets.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.342
All I wanna do
is be a good G.I. Joe.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.634
What's wrong with me?

08:30.885 --> 08:33.388
Not sure, but I think our
answers will be at Greendale.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.350
Shouldn't somebody
fly the plane?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.934
- It's Submachopter.
- Whatever.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.438
Will somebody grab the stick?
I don't wanna die up here! Oh, Lord!

08:45.608 --> 08:48.069
The G.I. Joe mutineers
are even worse than Cobra...

08:48.361 --> 08:50.155
because they're traitors.
Buzzkill.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.365
- All government is a lie.
- Tight Ship.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.034
I control everything, or else!

08:54.325 --> 08:56.202
- Three Kids.
- My family comes first.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.494
Fourth Wall.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.598
Doesn't this guy also do the voice
for He-Man commercials?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.541
Their nefarious,
ruthless leader, Wingman.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.585
Hey, that's not true!
I love G.I. Joe!

09:03.877 --> 09:05.503
I don't know.
Seems like you hate it.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.338
This is all a misunderstanding.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.757
Tell it to the judge.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.092
Everything sold separately.
Assembly required.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.384
Nothing is happening.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.222
Cartoon coffee? Tight Ship is piloting
the Submachopter.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.474
At first it was Buzzkill, but she almost
crashed. When we pointed it out...

09:19.517 --> 09:20.828
she called us sexist
and went to the bathroom.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.103
She's smoking in there.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.314
Broke the detector.
That's a federal crime.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.566
I keep having these visions.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.443
Kids, little boys...

09:28.735 --> 09:31.362
Are these visions we should share
with the authorities?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.323
I want to go
to this Greendale place.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.533
- We're on our way.
- You remember Greendale?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.745
Why did you call me that?
What's with you people?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.055
What do you mean, "you people"?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.246
Nice.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.583
All clear.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.461
That's the excavation site entrance.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.463
How do we get past those guards?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.548
I think I got an idea.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.513
Your idea was doing what we did
to those guards at headquarters?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.140
- It was proven effective.
- Don't know, seems cheap.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.435
From an animated perspective, very
cheap. Help me club this hatch open.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.025
I know this place.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.365
It's filling me
with a sense of endless hours...

10:12.570 --> 10:15.907
for unfair wages and
printers that never have toner.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.784
What is this, Major Dick?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.078
That is a request
for hazard pay.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.456
Maybe you haven't heard,
but we can actually die now.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.833
We can't afford this.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.417
So we can afford to create...

10:26.709 --> 10:28.586
a new weaponised vehicle
once a week...

10:28.878 --> 10:31.256
but we get
minimum wage to risk our lives.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.383
Well, welcome to Cobra, XimXam.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.593
Maybe you noticed
our logo was a snake?

10:35.885 --> 10:36.885
Suck it up, guys!

10:37.095 --> 10:39.722
- While I have your attention, here.
- What is this?

10:40.014 --> 10:42.392
We have to lower salaries.
Our insurance is going up.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.684
- No way.
- What?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.270
You people can actually die now.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.813
It affects the health plan.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.441
Vice Cobra assistant commander,
we've been infiltrated by Joes!

10:50.733 --> 10:53.570
Well? Protect me!

10:53.862 --> 10:55.196
Hello, Greendale.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.825
I understand G.I. Joe has breached the
perimeter. Please eliminate them.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.619
Please don't forget this Saturday
is the Cobra fun run.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.289
If you miss it, you're letting
antiterrorists win.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.791
Overkill.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.836
Yes, it's me. But which me...

11:10.128 --> 11:12.088
is the real me?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.962
- Probably the one in the middle.
- The middle, right?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.346
My leg!

11:20.638 --> 11:23.474
Now, before you fight me, G.I. Joe,
you should be warned.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.144
I, XimXam, have a twin brother
named MixMax...

11:26.436 --> 11:28.062
that feels all my pain.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.815
And how is that
supposed to affect us?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.359
Psychologically?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.487
Today's soup is
a carrot puree with a...

11:36.779 --> 11:38.406
Damn it!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.825
Sorry. My twin brother is a...

11:41.117 --> 11:43.244
It's pointless to explain.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.537
- Hurts so much!
- Right?

11:44.829 --> 11:47.332
It shredded my meniscus!

11:51.044 --> 11:53.922
Shouldn't have done that.
Nope. Don't like that sound.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.574
Incredible. It's as if there's
something about this place...

11:56.799 --> 11:59.219
that feeds on ambition.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.520
I came from here. I work here.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.315
My name is Jeff Winger.
And you're Annie.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.067
And Shirley.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.568
And Abed and Britta.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.380
Britta? What kind of
lame name is that?

12:17.654 --> 12:21.199
I wanna be Buzzkill
because of my awesome saw:

12:22.158 --> 12:24.327
You guys are my friends
in real life.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.996
This is my imagination
or something.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.165
Freeze, everybody!
Don't make me zap you!

12:29.457 --> 12:30.457
Craig, it's me, Jeff.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.418
Oh, Jeffrey! Are you okay?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.587
No. Take it
from an expert in delusion.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.733
If Jeff's hallucinating something cool,
something's wrong, he has to get back.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.517
Have your wingpack,
or is it sold separately?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.760
- Here it is.
- Good.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.452
My fourth wall
penetrating powers...

12:42.553 --> 12:44.753
combined with this medium's
lack of internal logic...

12:44.806 --> 12:46.606
should allow me
an oversimplified solution.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.227
I'll be right back.
I have to get something.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.562
- What?
- The truth.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:03.366 --> 13:05.451
Oh, crap.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.123
Jeff, while you were gone,
I figured everything out.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.750
May be your delusion,
but I'm the one on the ball.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.003
I know why I'm here.
I'm unconscious.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.422
Jeff Winger's unconscious,
because he...

13:17.714 --> 13:19.966
I drank a fifth of Scotch.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.552
And I took some pills.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.471
Jeffrey, shame on you.
I have three kids.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.806
You saying you tried...?

13:27.098 --> 13:30.476
No, they were these stupid youth pills
that I bought in Koreatown.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.646
I took them because
it's my birthday and...

13:33.938 --> 13:36.316
I've been lying about my age.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.318
It's not something
I'm ready to deal with.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.070
You found a way to deal with it
through a psychotic break.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.922
Happens to the best of us.
These are the three layers of reality.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.955
We're in the cartoon layer. It's
separated from the live-action layer...

13:47.118 --> 13:49.638
by a dangerous mid-layer
called children's toy commercials...

13:49.704 --> 13:51.181
which you're seeing in your visions.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.245
I've modified your wingpack
to break this barrier...

13:53.458 --> 13:56.085
- I'm not going back.
- Jeff, you have to go back.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.047
I don't wanna be a middle-aged
community college teacher.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.008
I wanna be in G.I. Joe.
I wanna fight for freedom...

14:02.300 --> 14:04.093
wherever there's trouble, forever.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.304
Jeff, that's
your 10-year-old self talking.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.973
You've receded into
some infantile part of your mind.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.684
Imaginary Britta is right.
And only Imaginary Britta.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.188
In these visions, a giant child is
controlling you. Get away from him.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.689
I am him! That's the point.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.484
I created this. I chose this.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.778
Do you understand
the real Jeff Winger...

14:22.070 --> 14:25.365
is in actual medical jeopardy?
Like the kind in a one-hour drama?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.825
Jeff, please.
I don't want you to die.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.202
Can you hear me?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.371
I'm only dying out there, Annie.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.040
In here we're immortal.
Look at the rack I gave you.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.667
Those will stay
where they are for an eternity.

14:36.959 --> 14:37.959
You're welcome.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.173
Yo, Jobra!

14:42.465 --> 14:45.009
- "Yo, Jobra"?
- We talked it over and realised...

14:45.301 --> 14:48.054
since we can't kill each other,
we might as well team up.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.681
Seeing as we've got
a common enemy.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
- Seize them!
- You can't seize me.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.061
I am the creator
of your reality.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.688
I am Neo in the third act
of The Matrix.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.608
I'm also Neo in the first act
of the second Matrix.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.568
I didn't see the third one...

15:02.860 --> 15:04.487
but my guess is...

15:06.322 --> 15:08.574
Cobra and G.I. Joe
have finally united.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.077
- You guys need anything?
- We could use some milk.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.121
Let's go get some milk
for G.I. Joe.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.457
I'll wait it out in this cell
until you guys can reeducate me.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.668
- Yo, Jobra!
- Yo, Jobra.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.753
All figures come
with their own accessories.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.672
Wingman sold separately
or something.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.554
Look who's conscious again.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.639
You're selective
with those snake S's.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.266
What are you, my life coach?

15:33.558 --> 15:35.852
I'd make fun of some
physical detail about you...

15:36.144 --> 15:39.230
but there aren't any. You look like
some Aryan foosball figure.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.107
You don't have
to keep me prisoner.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.733
I want what you want.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.862
We can't just have you running around.
You're too powerful.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.447
So let's share the power.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.407
We can be gods here forever.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.909
For realsies?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.953
Absolutely.
I don't wanna leave here.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.873
I wanna hang out with you guys
and blow stuff up.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.124
All right.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.295
- Yo, Jobra.
- Yo, Jobra.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.588
Yo, Jobra.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.967
Say, do you mind if we ask you
a few questions about real life?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.427
No problem.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.846
- Ask.
- So...

16:12.138 --> 16:14.432
what do boobies look like?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.309
Wait. You don't know?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.396
You guys have never seen
a naked woman?

16:20.688 --> 16:22.440
You don't have
to make us feel bad.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.193
Have you guys
ever tasted Scotch?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.445
Does Scotch liquor exist here?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.490
You know what?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.784
Can I just go to the bathroom
real quick?

16:34.076 --> 16:36.037
Sure. Second door
over there on the right.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.830
Hey! We can't
go to the bathroom!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.374
Fool! He's getting away!

16:53.221 --> 16:54.347
This had better work.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.849
No, no, no, wait!

16:58.434 --> 17:00.478
Get off me! I wanna go home!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.980
Take me with you!
I want to see women's boobs!

17:03.272 --> 17:04.690
We can't both go!

17:04.982 --> 17:06.817
You're slowing me down! Let go!

17:10.780 --> 17:14.492
I can feel it! Yes!
I can feel reality!

17:14.784 --> 17:17.328
I've never felt so alive!

17:17.619 --> 17:20.330
Because you're fictional!
You can't survive this!

17:20.623 --> 17:22.500
Wait, why does my back hurt?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.086
Why do I just have
random pains in my body?

17:25.377 --> 17:28.506
Why is my ability to appreciate
new music diminishing?

17:31.425 --> 17:35.471
Need to gain speed before...

17:35.763 --> 17:37.473
Wingman is trying to
escape G.I. Joe.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.393
It's up to you to hold him back
with your inner child's hand.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.061
Damn it, I didn't make it.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.605
I'm not controlling him!
He's doing this himself!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.148
Screw you, kid!

17:46.440 --> 17:47.900
He burnt my hand.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.361
The Wingman wingpack
is not available in stores.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.573
- You control the toy.
- You control it, my ass.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.866
- What is it doing?
- Making a man of you.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.913
Everything sold separately.
Everyone dies eventually.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.040
Nobody gets out alive.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.085
His eyes are opening.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.920
That happens
when people die too.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.131
- Jeff! Jeffrey!
- Wait, don't slap him!

18:10.423 --> 18:11.882
It's me, the dean. I'm here.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.467
Wait, no, I think you have...

18:13.759 --> 18:14.759
Stop it, I'm awake.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.515
Jeff, you've been keeping
your birthday a secret?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.434
Yeah. Most people have cake.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.020
Not a fifth of Scotch
and what the hell else.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.939
"Age reverse,
life extend power"?

18:31.569 --> 18:32.820
This is Korean.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.947
- Okay, what am I?
- Chinese!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.532
I swear to God I feel Korean.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.409
Guys...

18:38.701 --> 18:39.701
I'm 40.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.078
I'm so sorry.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.708
- Yeah, we knew that.
- You know, I guess we knew...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.960
that you had to be
around 30 when we met.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.962
And it has been five years.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.882
Even if he had been 32,
we'd have to know he would be...

18:53.174 --> 18:55.426
- This isn't helping.
- You guys know I'm 38, right?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.473
I'm kidding. But you shouldn't
almost die over a number.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.475
What's important
are ranges of numbers.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.770
Still 18 to 49 for almost
a decade. That's valuable to society.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.647
Have any more of these pills left?

19:07.938 --> 19:10.816
I had the craziest dream.
It was all animated...

19:11.108 --> 19:14.153
and a G.I. Joe cartoon,
and you were all in it.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.989
- In it? How much?
- What clothes did you draw me in?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.407
Fully animated?

19:18.699 --> 19:21.702
It was a dream. You were unconscious.
Remember that Christmas I...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.371
Yes!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.165
Jeff, here's your present.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.626
Slim pickings
at the hospital gift shop...

19:28.918 --> 19:31.253
but we made do.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.341
"It's a old boy."

19:35.633 --> 19:37.051
Yes. He is a old boy.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.969
He's a old boy.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.763
Bring it in, guys.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.055
Jeff!

19:42.264 --> 19:44.183
Hey, listen,
I got a former partner...

19:44.475 --> 19:47.353
that's been here since '89
in a coma, so...

19:47.770 --> 19:49.772
1889?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.857
Winger, you're funny.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.193
You piece of...

20:00.783 --> 20:02.535
- This is cool!
- Make my name too.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.995
- What are you guys, cavemen?
- Buzzkill!

20:05.287 --> 20:07.957
That's a waste of spray paint.
We live in a fascist police state...

20:08.249 --> 20:10.876
disguised as democracy.
Think you'll shatter that illusion...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.128
by celebrating your own
meaningless identities?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.214
- Is church over yet?
- Fourth Wall!

20:15.506 --> 20:18.718
A good cartoon has a lesson at the
end. Getting heavy-handed or preachy...

20:19.009 --> 20:21.529
could turn an entire generation
into jaded, sarcastic babies.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.181
- Be friendly and direct.
- Keep the message simple.
