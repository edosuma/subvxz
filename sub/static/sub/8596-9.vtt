WEBVTT

00:00.961 --> 00:02.963
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.171 --> 00:04.381
You left me
no choice.

00:04.589 --> 00:07.592
Marcus Kane,
for the crime of treason,

00:07.801 --> 00:10.470
I hereby sentence you
to death.

00:10.679 --> 00:12.389
Aden is the most promising
of my novitiates.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.975
If I should die today,
he will likely succeed me.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.644
I won't just sit there
and watch you die.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.896
If you're right,
today's the day

00:20.105 --> 00:22.482
my spirit will choose
its successor.

00:22.691 --> 00:24.150
I thought you said there
were 9 novitiates

00:24.359 --> 00:25.443
at your conclave.

00:25.652 --> 00:26.778
What happened
to number 8?

00:26.987 --> 00:30.365
I'm sorry it had
to come to this, Clarke.

00:35.537 --> 00:36.496
What is that?

00:36.705 --> 00:39.374
It's the spirit
of the commander.

00:52.554 --> 00:55.390
The conclave
must be starting.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.271
Cool.
You see anything?

01:02.856 --> 01:05.692
Oh, come on. What?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.652
Bunch of grounders
fighting to the death

01:07.861 --> 01:09.362
to see who gets the a.I.
Drilled in their brain,

01:09.571 --> 01:12.032
that doesn't sound
fun to you?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.879
Hey...

01:26.087 --> 01:29.007
Clarke...

01:29.215 --> 01:32.677
I'm sorry.

01:32.886 --> 01:34.721
I know how much
she meant to you.

01:36.056 --> 01:38.725
This has nothing
to do with me.

01:40.018 --> 01:42.479
We need to make sure
that Aden wins.

01:48.818 --> 01:52.030
What, you come here
to finish the job?

01:52.238 --> 01:55.325
No.

01:55.533 --> 01:59.871
I'm here to fulfill
my vow to Lexa.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.248
Put these on.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.885
Look. The door
we were banging on

02:14.094 --> 02:15.470
for the last
24 hours is open.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.139
Let's use it.

02:18.348 --> 02:20.934
You killed
your commander.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.645
How are you still free?

02:23.853 --> 02:26.439
I'm the only
Fleimkepa.

02:28.066 --> 02:30.235
Now please,
if you go now,

02:30.443 --> 02:31.611
you can slip in
with the crowds

02:31.820 --> 02:33.321
arriving for
tomorrow's conclave.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.323
You heard the man.
All right. Let's--

02:35.532 --> 02:36.950
I need to see
Aden first.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.369
That's out of
the question.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.788
The Natblidas have begun
the purification ritual.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.748
That sounds kind
of private, Clarke.

02:43.957 --> 02:47.168
Where?

03:12.944 --> 03:15.488
They're just kids.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.755
I'm sorry
to disturb you.

03:32.964 --> 03:35.008
Would you like
a moment with her?

03:36.384 --> 03:39.012
No.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.347
I'm here to see you.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.769
You made me a promise
to support my people.

03:46.978 --> 03:49.772
If Heda's spirit
chooses me.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.317
Yes.

03:52.525 --> 03:54.110
Will you still?

03:57.155 --> 03:58.823
We all will.

03:59.032 --> 04:01.117
Lexa made each
of us vow it.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.087
We loved her.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.008
Out of our way.

04:23.848 --> 04:26.184
You.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.728
Aah! Aah!

04:30.146 --> 04:32.148
Rrr!

04:32.357 --> 04:33.358
No.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.568
Put the knife
down, Ontari.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.862
Your mother is dead
because of her.

04:38.071 --> 04:39.989
You will obey
your king.

04:43.076 --> 04:46.037
An unfortunate fact we have
her to thank for, as well.

04:48.248 --> 04:51.334
No matter.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.837
When I am Heda and
the king bows to me,

04:55.046 --> 04:57.048
you and every last
member of Skaikru

04:57.257 --> 04:59.175
will die.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.510
Hey...

06:01.279 --> 06:03.239
You inspire them.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.624
I'm not gonna let
you give up, either.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.675
Chancellor on deck.

06:26.679 --> 06:29.349
I thought
I had more time.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.226
I'm not here
for you.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.730
Each of you is guilty
of the same crimes as Kane,

06:35.938 --> 06:41.110
and as such, you will share
the same fate--death.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.660
My people are innocent.
They know nothing.

06:49.869 --> 06:52.413
Don't let them suffer
for my crimes,

06:52.622 --> 06:54.540
- please.
- Sir.

06:54.749 --> 06:56.125
Lincoln's right.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.960
All the others did was
run through an open door,

06:58.169 --> 07:00.797
same thing we would do
if we were in there.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.642
I believe that's true.

07:14.894 --> 07:18.147
Kane, Lincoln,
Sinclair,

07:18.356 --> 07:21.234
as the leaders
of this coup,

07:21.442 --> 07:24.987
you will pay for your
crimes with your lives.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.782
Execution
is set for dawn.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.943
What do you want?

08:15.413 --> 08:18.124
- What do--
- shh.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.877
Whoa, whoa, hey.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.674
It's OK.

08:45.026 --> 08:46.903
Huh.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.076
The bag blocks the signal.
Now we can talk.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.454
Who put it
in there?

08:56.662 --> 08:57.997
That's
not important right now.

08:58.206 --> 09:00.208
Pike just sentenced Lincoln
and Sinclair to death

09:00.416 --> 09:02.960
alongside Kane.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.379
Hmm, are you trying
to scare us?

09:05.588 --> 09:06.839
No. We're here
to help.

09:07.048 --> 09:08.674
I'm sure you have a plan
to break them out.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.593
What can we do?

09:10.801 --> 09:12.970
What are you
talking about?

09:13.179 --> 09:14.514
Harper,
come on.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.140
Look. We can help
from the inside.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.892
To pull this off,
we need people

09:18.100 --> 09:20.770
to hand them off to
on the outside.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.190
We seriously don't know
what you're talking about.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.733
You think we
want them to die?

09:25.942 --> 09:27.151
You know what?
Forget it.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.320
If my sister wants
to save Lincoln's life,

09:29.529 --> 09:32.114
you tell her to meet me
at the Dropship in an hour.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.368
Bellamy--

09:41.457 --> 09:44.335
after everything
we've been through,

09:44.544 --> 09:46.295
you don't trust me?

09:46.504 --> 09:48.673
Does your mom know
you're here, Monty?

10:17.535 --> 10:21.831
Glad you came.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.834
I'm alone, o.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.420
I'm here to help.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.176
Sleep well,
big brother.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.729
You do not
belong here.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.982
Really? Why is my blood
decorating your floor?

10:48.190 --> 10:50.776
There's nothing left
for you in Polis.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.236
Why have you
not gone?

10:52.445 --> 10:54.030
Yeah. That's what
I'd like to know.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.698
We need to talk
about Ontari.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.700
She wasn't
trained here.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.577
Why would you let her
into the conclave?

10:59.785 --> 11:02.163
Ontari has the blood
of the commanders.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.207
It is her birthright
to compete for the flame.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.430
Is she really
in there?

11:24.226 --> 11:26.354
Of course she is.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.789
What does it matter
who wins, huh?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.374
I mean, listen to me.

11:46.582 --> 11:47.667
If your girlfriend
really is in that thing,

11:47.875 --> 11:49.126
then we have nothing
to worry about, right?

11:49.335 --> 11:51.045
Clarke, let's just get
out of here while we can.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.797
It matters.

11:53.005 --> 11:56.342
I've served 4 commanders
as Fleimkepa,

11:56.550 --> 11:59.303
none of them half
as wise or strong

11:59.512 --> 12:02.306
as Lexa Kom Trikru.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.225
The truth is, she was
all those things

12:04.433 --> 12:06.519
even before ascension.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.939
The flame deepens
what's already there.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.108
If the spirit
of the commander

12:12.316 --> 12:13.901
should choose Ontari,
the ice nation

12:14.110 --> 12:15.319
will control
everything,

12:15.528 --> 12:17.863
and Skaikru will
face her wrath.

12:18.072 --> 12:21.951
Not really a silver-lining
type of guy, is he?

12:22.159 --> 12:26.038
So how do we
make sure Aden wins?

12:26.247 --> 12:28.874
He was Lexa's choice.
You know that.

12:29.083 --> 12:32.044
And she will
choose him.

12:33.963 --> 12:35.965
What's that?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.800
The victory horn.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.567
What's going on?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.193
Shh.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.792
What is the meaning
of this?

13:19.884 --> 13:21.051
Aden.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.429
If she sees you,
she'll have your head, too.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.431
Clarke, I think we
should get out of here.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.661
I win.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.084
Oh...

13:58.172 --> 14:01.133
It was a mistake
to bring him here.

14:01.342 --> 14:03.552
He was out
the whole way,

14:03.761 --> 14:05.429
and I searched
him for bugs.

14:05.638 --> 14:06.931
You think I'd let
them hurt you?

14:07.139 --> 14:08.432
Shut your mouth.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.434
Indra, we talked
about this.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.353
You waste time. You should
be in their camp by now.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.147
No. It's suicide. Pike
will be expecting you.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.359
You won't get close.
I can.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.278
We can save them,
but we have to work together.

14:21.487 --> 14:24.406
You're the reason
they need saving.

14:28.077 --> 14:31.956
Maybe, but that
doesn't change the fact

14:32.164 --> 14:34.875
that you need me.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.171
For the first time
in my life,

14:39.380 --> 14:41.590
that's not true.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.592
O.--

14:44.718 --> 14:46.345
o.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.231
Hey, I got
your message.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.817
What's wrong?

15:00.025 --> 15:04.488
I, um, have
a confession to make.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.496
I'm a spy, Bryan.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.874
I've been passing
information for--

15:15.082 --> 15:17.042
hey, shut up.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.090
Found the bug.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.386
You put it there?

15:27.595 --> 15:29.972
You?

15:33.309 --> 15:37.479
Why were you so afraid
of what I might say, Bryan?

15:37.688 --> 15:39.273
We execute
traitors now.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.649
Yeah. We do. You have
a problem with that?

15:40.858 --> 15:43.110
- Nate, I--
- what, to pike?

15:43.319 --> 15:44.695
I know. He saved
your life out there.

15:44.904 --> 15:47.948
- You owe him.
- OK, but I love you.

15:49.617 --> 15:52.912
Yeah. Well, you can't
have both of us.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.217
You can thank
chancellor pike for this.

16:07.426 --> 16:10.095
You've got 5 minutes.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.359
Are you all right?

16:27.196 --> 16:30.074
I won't let this
happen to you.

16:30.282 --> 16:33.702
Abby, listen.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.914
Anyone caught
helping us

16:37.122 --> 16:40.542
will be condemned
to death, too.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.711
Then I won't
get caught.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.090
Look. I'm begging you--

16:48.592 --> 16:52.596
I'm begging you,
just don't--don't do it.

16:52.805 --> 16:56.600
Our people need
someone here

16:56.809 --> 16:59.311
to show them a way
out of the dark.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.651
I can't
do this again.

17:23.377 --> 17:27.172
Don't make this any harder
than it already is.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.599
Guard.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.500
Slow down, roan.
We need to talk to Titus.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.502
Trust me, right now
your friend Titus

18:05.711 --> 18:06.962
is on his knees
in front of Ontari.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.673
No. There's no way
that he'll support someone

18:09.882 --> 18:12.092
who hacked the heads off
children while they slept.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.511
Yeah. Those children were
marked for death, anyway.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.722
You'll support
her, too,

18:16.930 --> 18:19.058
she's ice nation.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.684
Whatever's best
for your people,

18:20.893 --> 18:21.977
is that it?

18:22.186 --> 18:23.353
That's it, kind of like
killing every man,

18:23.562 --> 18:24.980
woman, and child
in mount weather

18:25.189 --> 18:26.815
was best for yours.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.692
That's not
a bad point.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.611
Shut up, Murphy.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.321
Tunnel's through here.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.573
OK. Great.
Thank you.

18:34.782 --> 18:36.075
Saved your life
again.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.535
My debt to Lexa for
sparing mine's now paid.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.997
Next time you see me
won't be as friends.

18:53.759 --> 18:56.428
We are not
leaving, are we?

18:58.889 --> 19:01.558
Not without
the flame.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.032
Could've worked.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.581
Death can be an act
of unity, too.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.625
We don't break.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.462
We don't show fear.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.304
The people will remember.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.766
- Chancellor on deck.
- It's time.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.269
OK. Open the door.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.154
Back up. Back up.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.992
Against the wall now.
Come on. Let's go. Go. Go.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.170
Make way.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.796
Yes, sir,
Mr. chancellor.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.131
Let's go.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.684
Come on.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.353
Package is
on the move.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.564
I repeat, package
is on the move.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.065
We are a go.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.443
She's talking
about the prisoners.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.361
Whose voice was that?

20:36.570 --> 20:38.780
OKs, is your
team in position?

20:38.989 --> 20:40.157
OKs.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.491
Octavia, on radio:
Roger that.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.702
We're in position
and ready to intercept.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.206
Octavia Kom Skaikru.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.625
Sir, you were right.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.211
Octavia Blake is here,
and she's not alone.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.504
On their knees.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.383
Can you confirm
a location?

21:00.344 --> 21:01.470
Negative, sir.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.763
Sir, we can assume
her friends have

21:02.971 --> 21:04.556
already told her
where we're taking them.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.767
We shouldn't go any further
till we know the route's secure.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.023
Put them in there.
Let's go! Move.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.150
Come on.
Let's go.

21:15.359 --> 21:16.401
- Move it.
- Come on.

21:16.610 --> 21:19.529
Uh!

21:19.738 --> 21:21.740
I want two men
on the door.

21:21.949 --> 21:22.991
- We got it.
- Good.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.160
Anyone comes out of there,
shoot to kill.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.954
Anyone enters
this corridor,

21:27.162 --> 21:29.039
one warning,
then shoot to kill.

21:29.248 --> 21:30.666
Everyone else
on me.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.880
Indra, please,
she has no idea

21:37.089 --> 21:38.966
what she's
facing in there.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.717
Pike has tripled
his security.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.302
There's surveillance
everywhere.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.470
He'll see
her coming.

21:43.679 --> 21:45.806
Good. We're
counting on that.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.808
He still trusts me.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.768
If anything goes wrong,
we can use that.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.728
I saw where you
earned that trust,

21:51.937 --> 21:53.397
on the battlefield,
where you massacred

21:53.605 --> 21:55.524
my brothers
and sisters.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.943
Should I have
let pike kill you?

21:58.151 --> 21:59.611
Why didn't you?

21:59.820 --> 22:04.283
Same reason you haven't
used that sword on me.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.077
Octavia.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.788
We are running
out of time.

22:09.997 --> 22:13.041
Cut me loose.
She could die in there.

22:13.250 --> 22:16.003
Then Octavia Kom Skaikru

22:16.211 --> 22:19.214
will earn the warrior's
death you denied me.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.845
Uh! Rrgh!

22:25.053 --> 22:26.680
Uh!

22:33.645 --> 22:35.397
Have I mentioned
that I hate this idea?

22:35.605 --> 22:37.941
We can't let Ontari
get the flame.

22:41.069 --> 22:45.282
Come on.
He keeps it in the pod.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.909
Just stay there.
I'll be quick.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.312
You killed her.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.568
I pulled the trigger,
but it was you.

23:21.777 --> 23:24.821
Titus...

23:25.030 --> 23:28.283
You made Lexa
a promise, remember?

23:28.492 --> 23:30.619
Give me the kit.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.040
I know you don't want
Ontari to get the flame.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.625
She murdered
those kids,

23:36.833 --> 23:37.876
children you raised.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.628
Lexa's spirit
would never choose

23:39.836 --> 23:41.380
- to do something like that.
- Yes, she did.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.049
You don't
believe that.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.300
I have to.

23:45.509 --> 23:48.512
Ontari Kom Azgeda
is the last Natblida.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.847
Then put the damn thing
in someone else.

23:51.056 --> 23:55.102
You stupid girl, after
all you've witnessed here,

23:55.310 --> 23:57.646
you still think this
is just superstition.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.940
When someone without
the blood takes the flame,

24:00.148 --> 24:01.817
the flame takes
their life.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.527
I don't understand.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.195
If nightblood
is so rare,

24:05.404 --> 24:07.239
then why do you let them
kill each other?

24:07.447 --> 24:08.407
That has to be
the dumbest

24:08.615 --> 24:10.242
succession plan
I've--

24:10.450 --> 24:13.870
we honor those who
die in the conclave.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.915
What? Wait.
The eighth circle.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.126
Lexa had markings
on her back

24:19.334 --> 24:21.962
for every life she took
at her conclave,

24:22.170 --> 24:25.173
7 circles,
only she told me

24:25.382 --> 24:29.428
that there were 8
novitiates in her class.

24:29.636 --> 24:33.306
What happened
to number 8?

24:34.891 --> 24:38.437
There's another
Natblida, isn't there?

24:40.272 --> 24:42.607
Yes.

24:42.816 --> 24:45.068
She fled,

24:45.277 --> 24:48.780
a coward and a traitor
to the blood.

24:48.989 --> 24:52.951
Lexa refused to let me
hunt her down.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.371
She's unworthy
of the flame.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.124
More unworthy
than Ontari?

25:00.459 --> 25:02.127
Hey, hey, just--hey!

25:02.335 --> 25:03.211
Uh!

25:05.881 --> 25:08.341
She's here. Uh...

25:08.550 --> 25:10.635
Hide.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.233
How dare you
bring Skaikru

25:25.442 --> 25:27.402
into the order
of the flame?

25:27.611 --> 25:29.112
It's what
Lexa wanted.

25:29.321 --> 25:32.616
Well, Lexa's
not Heda anymore,

25:32.824 --> 25:34.701
thanks to you.

25:34.910 --> 25:37.245
Let's get this
over with.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.836
You must be cleansed
before you ascend.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.047
Take her to the
commander's chambers.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.548
Perform the ritual.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.675
Are you sure
I'm ready for that?

26:09.402 --> 26:11.821
Thank you.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.660
Even Luna would be
better than her.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.956
Did you
just say Luna?

26:23.166 --> 26:26.086
Yes. You heard
the name before?

26:26.294 --> 26:29.297
From my friend
Lincoln.

26:29.506 --> 26:32.008
Can he find her?

26:32.217 --> 26:37.305
Then perhaps the spirit
hasn't chosen, after all.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.808
I'll take you
to him.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.229
Luna will never
allow me near her.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.750
This is yours now.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.549
I'll protect it
with my life.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.217
There's a book
inside.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.927
It's the journal
of the first commander.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.429
When you find Luna,
you'll need it

27:17.637 --> 27:20.265
to perform
the ascension ritual.

27:20.473 --> 27:24.311
Come. Armor of
past commanders.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.985
Choose something.
Take the hidden passage.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.695
The tunnel will lead you
to the stable.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.155
They're
expecting you.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.616
- What about Murphy?
- I'll get him out.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.620
Your duty is
to the flame now...

27:41.828 --> 27:44.080
Fleimkepa.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.925
Same drill. Sweep in pairs.
Watch your blind spots.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.095
Sir.
Cover every corner. Clear.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.765
Sir, the hangar bay
is secure. They're not here.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.395
Something's not right.

28:07.604 --> 28:11.232
Unit 4, what's your status?
Are the prisoners secure?

28:13.568 --> 28:14.736
Unit 4.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.991
Let's go.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.161
Watch the doors.

28:24.663 --> 28:25.747
Check them
and call medical.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.916
Yes, sir.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.085
Medical,
two guards down,

28:30.293 --> 28:31.795
Alpha station
corridor,

28:32.003 --> 28:33.838
need assistance
there now.

28:36.174 --> 28:38.677
Damn!

28:38.885 --> 28:40.512
The guys
are alive, sir.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.472
They must have
drugged them.

28:42.681 --> 28:45.809
We did what they
wanted us to do.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.520
That won't happen again.

29:01.991 --> 29:05.036
All clear.
Come on. Let's go.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.377
Uh...

29:14.129 --> 29:16.506
It's a little bit
tight in there.

29:17.841 --> 29:21.052
Try doing it
for 16 years.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.809
Hey, we'll come back
for Danae and the others,

29:28.017 --> 29:30.729
I promise.

29:30.937 --> 29:34.315
Hey, hey, you OK?

29:40.780 --> 29:42.449
I told you
not to do this.

29:42.657 --> 29:45.285
Why would I start
listening to you now?

29:45.493 --> 29:48.788
Hey--

29:50.623 --> 29:52.083
Harper, on radio:
OKs, come in.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.210
- What is it?
- This wasn't the plan.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.379
We use their frequency
so they could hear us.

29:56.588 --> 29:57.547
Go ahead.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.090
Stay
where you are.

29:59.299 --> 30:02.427
Man, on radio:
Left corridor clear.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.221
Repeat, stay where you are.
The exit is not clear.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.976
How many guards?

30:10.185 --> 30:11.936
Too many.
I said, stay put.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.355
They're trapped.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.696
Uh!

30:22.822 --> 30:24.365
Area clear.

30:27.410 --> 30:28.620
Calling all guards.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.038
The prisoners are
headed for the main gate.

30:30.246 --> 30:31.915
The prisoners are headed
for the main gate. Over.

30:32.123 --> 30:33.333
Monty, what
are you doing?

30:33.541 --> 30:35.752
Saving my friends.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.338
Move, move, move.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.173
We're on our way
there now.

30:46.095 --> 30:47.889
That was Monty.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.933
Guess he's with
us after all.

30:50.141 --> 30:51.184
Pike will
find out.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.811
We don't know that.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.980
What we do know is,
we have to move.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.278
Your friends
are traitors.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.323
Then I guess
I'm one, too.

31:07.492 --> 31:08.952
How many men to we have
at the main gate?

31:11.704 --> 31:15.041
Sir, we just got word
that was another false report.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.459
Team two,
we're at the main gate.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.753
There's nothing here.

31:18.962 --> 31:19.796
Different man, on radio:
Yeah. 10-4.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.089
We're on it.
Negative here.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.340
Lock this camp down.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.551
We're going
door to door. Go.

31:30.139 --> 31:33.768
In the meantime, let's see
if we can't bring them to us.

31:33.977 --> 31:35.353
Go, go, go.
Go. Come on.

31:35.562 --> 31:37.355
Woman, on P.A.:
Attention, all citizens.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.607
Emergency lockdown is in effect.

31:39.816 --> 31:41.943
Return to your quarters
immediately.

31:42.151 --> 31:45.363
OK, Abby. Come on.
You're next.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.533
I'm not going.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.159
They need someone
to show them

31:50.368 --> 31:51.744
the way out
of the dark.

31:51.953 --> 31:52.787
Besides, I--

32:04.966 --> 32:07.343
may we meet again.

32:07.552 --> 32:09.304
We will.

32:15.935 --> 32:19.355
I have a message
for the traitors in this camp.

32:19.564 --> 32:22.191
There will be
an execution today.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.697
Either turn yourselves in,

32:27.906 --> 32:32.201
or the other grounder prisoners
will die in your place.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.954
Let's go.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.583
No. Wait.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.043
I can't let them
die because of me.

32:40.251 --> 32:43.463
Lincoln, please.
We're almost out.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.924
I know what you're feeling, but
they're searching the station.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.759
We need to go now.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.012
You should.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.891
Fine. I'm going
with you.

33:01.606 --> 33:04.317
I love you.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.076
No.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.036
Uh...

33:15.244 --> 33:16.746
What are you
doing?

33:16.955 --> 33:20.208
Same thing you'd do
for your people.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.877
Just get her
out of here.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.848
You, too.

33:47.527 --> 33:49.487
Freeze!

34:34.907 --> 34:37.577
How much longer?

34:37.785 --> 34:40.997
Purification
is a process.

34:46.419 --> 34:48.921
You're not
afraid of me.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.050
I don't
scare easily.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.844
The truth is,

34:55.053 --> 34:57.388
I think what you did
was smart,

34:57.597 --> 34:59.307
a little crazy
maybe,

34:59.515 --> 35:03.144
but we do what we have
to do to survive, right?

35:03.352 --> 35:05.897
You know I plan to
wipe out your people.

35:06.105 --> 35:09.984
So I've heard.
Sucks for them.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.228
What is this?

35:45.436 --> 35:48.022
The Flamekeeper claims
he lost the flame.

35:49.649 --> 35:52.276
You, where's
Wanheda?

35:52.485 --> 35:53.820
How would I know?

35:54.028 --> 35:55.655
Don't play games with me.
I know she stole the flame.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.574
- Where is she?
- She didn't steal it.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.996
I gave it to her.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.544
Where's she taking it?

36:09.752 --> 36:11.712
You mission
is to pass the flame.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.089
You wouldn't
give it to her

36:13.297 --> 36:14.674
without a Natblida
to pass it to.

36:16.092 --> 36:17.385
You can't kill him.

36:17.593 --> 36:19.637
He's the only one who
can perform the ritual.

36:19.846 --> 36:24.767
This abomination
will never ascend.

36:24.976 --> 36:26.894
Kill him.

36:28.396 --> 36:31.274
He's right.

36:31.482 --> 36:33.901
We need him.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.078
For Lexa.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.271
Announce my ascension.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.190
You don't have
the flame, Ontari.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.817
Don't talk to me
as if I'm a fool, roan.

37:15.026 --> 37:17.278
No one knows that.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.197
He does.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.949
He happens
to like his head.

37:24.577 --> 37:27.163
Light the pyre.

37:27.371 --> 37:30.249
Burn the bitch
who killed your mother.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.002
Let the people know
they have a new commander

37:33.211 --> 37:35.755
and find Wanheda.

37:35.963 --> 37:38.216
That's an order.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.870
Heda.

38:52.039 --> 38:54.000
No.

38:55.793 --> 38:57.086
What is it?

38:57.295 --> 38:59.255
A new commander
has risen.

39:00.965 --> 39:02.550
You go running,

39:02.758 --> 39:04.385
just like
mount weather, huh?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.512
Maybe this time,
Octavia will get it.

39:06.721 --> 39:10.599
Your loyalty will always
be with your people.

39:10.808 --> 39:13.644
Octavia is my people.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.521
Then take
these chains off me,

39:15.730 --> 39:17.606
and we can
help her together.

39:21.694 --> 39:24.071
Tell her I'm sorry.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.084
Lincoln.
