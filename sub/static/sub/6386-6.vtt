WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.969
The D.A.'s office is willing
to drop the assault charges.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.071
That's the good news.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.305
What's the bad news?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.074
You're being charged
with statutory rape.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.842
Yeah, you should probably
consider a little "manscaping."

00:09.877 --> 00:11.677
- You're way hairy.
- Really?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.113
Ah.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.314
Aah!

00:15.349 --> 00:16.749
- I'm late.
- Bingo.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.284
Come on, let's go get you
a pregnancy test.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.853
Fuck, the rabbit done died.

00:20.888 --> 00:21.988
I met the wife.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.923
Yeah, soon-to-be ex.
Splitsville.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.791
So you wouldn't mind
if I took a crack at her?

00:25.826 --> 00:28.928
Considering that you actually
wrote the book that I love,

00:28.962 --> 00:32.497
how about you rewrite
the script that I loathe?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.833
And Sasha Bingham will star?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.102
Yes, she's reading as we speak.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.004
- What about Eddie Nero?
- So is there a script?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.071
Fuck, no.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.640
- But he's getting close.
- Ish.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.008
With Sasha's interest

00:42.042 --> 00:45.178
and with Hank's face
all over the news right now,

00:45.212 --> 00:47.647
we could be at Sundance
this time next year.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.148
The prosecution
has a lame case,

00:49.183 --> 00:50.316
and they know it too.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.785
Have you met my attorney?

00:52.819 --> 00:54.253
You should probably
stay far away

00:54.288 --> 00:56.122
from the Mias and the Sashas
of the world right now.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.797
Hey, check it out.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.130 --> 01:38.598
It should be
pretty cut and dry.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.500
You plead guilty
to unlawful sexual conduct.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.270
The statutory rape charge
goes away.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.874
Discretion, counselor...

01:48.909 --> 01:51.077
It being the better part
of valor and whatnot.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.945
In any case...

01:54.381 --> 01:56.182
You're looking
at a $1,000 fine,

01:56.216 --> 01:58.517
18 months summary probation.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.353
Uh, the only thing left
to hammer out

02:00.387 --> 02:02.521
is the nature and duration
of your community service.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.190
Done.
Where do I sign?

02:04.224 --> 02:06.525
But instead of doing
community service,

02:06.560 --> 02:07.860
can I do a P.S.A.?

02:07.894 --> 02:09.729
Hi, I'm Hank Moody.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.264
Don't fuck teenagers.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.266
And can I borrow
a thousand bucks?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.067
Kidding...
About the P.S.A.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.436
I'll be damned.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.904
I think I'm actually seeing

02:18.939 --> 02:23.943
some of that Hank Moody mojo
up close and personal.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.444
Is my dong out?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.180
You should probably card her
just to be safe.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.182
You are on fire.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.717
Hi, excuse me.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.052
Do we know each other?

02:33.086 --> 02:35.588
Sorry, you're, uh,
kind of famous.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.723
That's right.
I am kind of famous.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.392
It's good to see that the young
kids are still reading.

02:39.426 --> 02:43.562
Last time I checked,
my shit wasn't Kindle-worthy.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.264
- Ow!
- Sorry.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.233
Dick.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.768
Don't open it.
No, no.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.037
- Let me... God.
- Fuck you.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.848
She's right.
You are a dick.

03:05.886 --> 03:15.826
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:52.199 --> 03:54.500
Nice work, asshole.
Deal's off.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.736
What? No fair.
Indian giver.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.504
As you know, the D.A.
is running for governor.

03:58.538 --> 03:59.872
And voters
just don't take kindly

03:59.906 --> 04:02.408
to public officials who go soft
on child molesters.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.776
But nothing happened.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.311
The young ladies in question
were just screwing around,

04:05.345 --> 04:06.779
and I put a stop to that shit.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.781
I can't help it
if some cock-tard in a fedora

04:08.815 --> 04:10.750
takes a picture
at the exact wrong moment.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.817
It doesn't matter.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.886
It looks like
something happened.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.588
It looks like you're out there
thumbing your nose

04:15.622 --> 04:16.856
at the state of California.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.089
Okay, I get it.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.326
Duly noted...
must stop thumbing nose.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.660
All right?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.796
So what do we do now?
What's... what's the move?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.098
- You look for a new attorney.
- What?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.867
I should've gone with my gut
on this one.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.269
What are you saying,
you're quitting?

04:30.303 --> 04:31.604
In a word,
abso-fucking-lutely.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.972
I'm dropping the case,

04:33.006 --> 04:35.508
leaving the opportunity
for you to find an attorney

04:35.542 --> 04:37.710
who suits
your particular personality.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.946
You can't do that.
Can you?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.948
Hank, I have never had a client

04:42.983 --> 04:45.618
who makes it this difficult
for me to do my job.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.119
You should talk to my agent.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.655
I will. I'll call him,
and I'll recommend someone new.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.458
Quitter.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.593
Good luck to you, Hank.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.695
I wish I could say
it was nice knowing you,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.631
but that would be
a big, fat lie,

04:58.665 --> 05:00.833
because you have been
an enormous pain in my ass.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.001
Normally I would have

05:02.035 --> 05:03.736
an incredibly childish
retort to that,

05:03.770 --> 05:04.904
but I'm not going to.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.772
I'm gonna take the high road.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.041
You have a great ass.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.476
And the thought
that I have brought it any pain

05:10.510 --> 05:11.844
brings me pain.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.412
All I want to do
is bring your ass pleasure.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.980
That's how highly I regard it.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.850
And there it goes,
Abby's fantastic ass.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.686
Fare thee well.
Take care.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.189
We'll always have Century City.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.092
I'm fucked.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.229
Go the fuck away.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.204
I don't want
any more fucking chocolates.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.338
It's you.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.240
- What do you want?
- Settle down, grumpy.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.308
Can I come in?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.843
Haven't you caused me
enough trouble?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.344
This is my fault?

05:45.378 --> 05:47.279
Well, seeing as I'm
in no mood to blame myself,

05:47.314 --> 05:48.881
yes, yes, it is.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.683
Come on in.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.555
You live like a fucking animal.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.991
Which is exactly why it would
never work out between us.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.993
Well, that and the fact
that you're old enough

06:01.027 --> 06:02.561
to be my grandfather.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.465
Oh, fuck, are you trying
to make me kill myself?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.434
So I have some good news
and some bad news.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.702
Which would you prefer?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.570
Do it whatever way you want,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.472
fucking diva.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.241
I'm dropping out.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.376
Of high school?

06:17.410 --> 06:18.511
The movie.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.778
Oh, that.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.780
All right,
I will... I will write you

06:21.815 --> 06:23.949
that big Oscar speech
that you wanted at the end.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.918
- No, no, it's not that.
- Okay, you got it.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.653
This is a lot
of bad press for me.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.556
And while a scandal
can be a good thing,

06:30.590 --> 06:33.225
this whole thing
is getting a little unsavory.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.094
Hmm.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.596
Okay, so no movie.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.398
Movie, no.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.766
What's the good news?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.402
The good news is that I still
want to have sex with you,

06:43.436 --> 06:44.904
at least once more,

06:44.938 --> 06:46.438
if not twice.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.840
That's the good news?

06:47.874 --> 06:49.942
Mm-hmm.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.511
Oh, my.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.447
You know,
that is pretty good news.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.149
Maybe a little something
for the pain.

07:03.623 --> 07:04.924
Shit.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.392
Put your shirt back on.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.127
Could be the law.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.435
Just as I suspected, the law.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.704
Karen, come on in.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.206
Hey.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.742
Karen, I'd like you
to meet Sasha Bingham.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.411
They tell me
she's a big movie star.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.179
Personally, I don't see it.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.148
Hi, you're so beautiful.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.550
Oh, my God,
I totally get it now.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.652
- How'd you fuck this up?
- Thank you.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.155
That's helpful.
You can go now.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.457
It's nice to meet you, Sasha.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.960
Um, of course,
I know exactly who you are,

07:40.994 --> 07:42.828
because I've seen
all the photos.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.065
And that's my cue.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.900
Peace.

07:47.934 --> 07:48.968
Wow.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.936
I am disappointed
in you, Karen...

07:50.971 --> 07:53.038
Reading all those stupid blogs.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.206
Becca showed me.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.241
Bec... Oh, fuck.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.979
How is she?
Is she okay?

08:00.013 --> 08:01.113
Okay?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.215
W-what does that even mean
at this point?

08:03.249 --> 08:07.186
Wha... Uh, what do you want
from me, Karen?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.221
Look around.
Welcome to rock bottom.

08:09.255 --> 08:12.858
I'm living in this shitty,
filthy hotel room.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.660
My... my career's
in the shitter.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.795
You obviously hate me.
Becca hates me.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.232
My attorney dumped me.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.634
Your attorney dumped you?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.168
How does that even happen?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.170
I don't know.
She got tired of my shit.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.438
It's a trend.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.806
What the fuck?
Whatever.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.174
But wasn't she
one of the good ones?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.442
I think so.
She seemed good.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.745
She's smart, snappy dresser,
nice briefcase.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.780
What the fuck do I know
about lawyers?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.715
Did you think to apologize?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.385
I mean, you can really switch
the charm on when you want to.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.186
I don't have a switch.
The switch is gone.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.124
I can't find the switch.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.527
Can you just...

08:48.561 --> 08:50.195
Apologize to Becca for me

08:50.230 --> 08:53.499
and... and... and tell her that
I'll... I'll make it up to her?

08:53.533 --> 08:56.869
You know how you can
make it up to her?

08:56.903 --> 08:59.071
You can get your head
out of your fucking ass

08:59.105 --> 09:01.540
and get your shit together.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.008
Hank, you're slipping.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.244
You're know,
you're really fucking slipping.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.312
I mean, whatever happens
between us,

09:07.347 --> 09:09.982
you have always managed
to be a decent father.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.052
If you let that go,
you're fucked.

09:13.086 --> 09:17.790
You're totally fucked forever.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.892
No, no, no, no, no.
This is your shit.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.027
I'm... I'm gone.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.763
You figure it out.

09:30.704 --> 09:35.974
♪

09:36.009 --> 09:37.910

Okay.

09:45.351 --> 09:47.119
You got it.

Oh, hey, listen.

Um, your boss...

How hairy are we talking here?

09:54.394 --> 09:55.894
Pardon?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.497
It's just that, uh, I have
to get back to the West Side,

09:58.531 --> 10:01.200
and I want to kind of
wrap it up before rush hour.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.269
So how hairy is the missus?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.871
Mrs. Hairy?

10:05.905 --> 10:07.639
I no understand,

Stu...

10:21.054 --> 10:22.755
You made the appointment
with me?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.957
No, no, Irma booked
the appointment

10:24.991 --> 10:26.625
on my behalf.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.961
So you want
the full Kardashian?

10:28.995 --> 10:31.630
No, no.
God, no.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.632
I would rather explode.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.868
No, when Irma called hot lips,

10:35.902 --> 10:37.102
they said that's
what it would take

10:37.137 --> 10:38.437
for you to make a house call.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.873
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.808
Listen, I called.
I texted.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.143
And in return, zilch.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.978
So I had to get
a little creative.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.112
Unbelievable.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.515
Baby, I'm a producer,
so I produce.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.749
What can I say?

10:50.784 --> 10:53.619
Well, you could
say sorry, asshole,

10:53.653 --> 10:54.820
because I canceled

10:54.854 --> 10:56.655
a whole afternoon's worth
of appointments.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.157
Do you know how much
this little stunt of yours

10:58.191 --> 10:59.158
is gonna cost me?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.492
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.294
I didn't mean to...

11:02.328 --> 11:05.197
It's just that
I wanted to see you...

11:05.231 --> 11:06.398
So much.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.835
I'll be glad to pay you
for your time.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.437
I-I mean, if you would
just stay here

11:12.472 --> 11:13.572
and hang out for a while.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.240
I stay, I wax.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.975
Take it or leave it.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.678
Oh.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.682
All right, then.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.251
The full Kardashian it is.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.755
Sasha dropped out.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.456
I know.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.591
Abby too.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.992
I know.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.295
I've brought shame
upon my family.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.596
Oh, I know.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.331
Yeah, that's it.
It's decided, then.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.333
I'm going out tonight.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.303
Like zig,
I'm jerking myself to Jesus.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.704
Good knowing you, Runks.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.039
Sounds like a plan.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.274
But you might want
to reconsider.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.976
Yeah, I don't think so.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.345
Guess who's back
in the picture.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.180
Hmm?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.015
Someone who can
get this thing green-lit

11:57.050 --> 11:58.684
with one magic word.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.253

12:05.925 --> 12:07.759
He says the script
is keeping him up nights.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.929
Yeah, he says he can't get
the character out of his head.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.966
He wants to hang out with you.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.035
He says he wants to try
the role on for size

12:17.070 --> 12:18.804
before he commits, you know?

12:18.838 --> 12:21.707
Experience a night in the life

12:21.741 --> 12:23.709
of the infamous Hank Moody.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.210
I don't think he'd enjoy

12:25.245 --> 12:27.379
watching me go
all autoerotic on myself.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.380
Do you?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.649
Maybe.
Maybe not.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.918
Maybe you save that
for another night.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.920
Maybe, yeah.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.322
It'd be kind of rude to do to
housekeeping, don't you think?

12:37.357 --> 12:38.390
Totally rude.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.625
You'd have to leave
a pretty big tip

12:39.659 --> 12:40.826
to make up
for something like that.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.362
Totally.

my mouth,

17:18.704 --> 17:20.005
my tongue.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.111
And then he gave me his gift.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.546
Gave it to me on the inside.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.515
And that's the day I graduated.

19:25.564 --> 19:26.898
Here's what we're gonna do.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.234
We're gonna back up slowly
and get the fuck out.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.835
I got your back, rapist.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.970
You can't afford any more
trouble with the police.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.938
Hey, isn't that Eddie Nero?

19:33.973 --> 19:36.141
Holy shit, that's Eddie Nero.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.909
Holy shit, you're right.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.244
You guys fans?

19:39.278 --> 19:40.345
It is Eddie Nero.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.479
Aah! Ow!

19:41.514 --> 19:42.580
God damn it!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.683
Hank, the movie!

19:44.717 --> 19:46.618
Agent, pay him.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.520
You fucked up my face.
You fucked up the moneymaker.

19:48.554 --> 19:49.988
Okay, okay.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.456
Queens of Dogtown...

19:51.490 --> 19:53.124
Here we go.
Should be a hundred there.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.559
Now, listen, while we're here,

19:54.593 --> 19:56.094
I'd like to get
your professional opinion.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.762
Could you do something cool
with this?

19:57.797 --> 19:58.797
- No, whoa!
- What? What?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.765
Get this fucking guy
out of my shop.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.601
What? What?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.737
- I'm Karen.
- Abby. Nice to meet you.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.005
Please, have a seat.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.741
Thank you so much for, um...
for seeing me.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.843
Oh, my pleasure.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.511
Uh, to be perfectly clear,

20:13.546 --> 20:16.481
I am no longer
representing Mr. Moody.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.183
I know.
That's why I'm here.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.185
Um...

20:20.219 --> 20:23.321
I want to try to convince you
to give him a second chance.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.490
Why?

20:25.524 --> 20:27.826
Because I've given him
too many already,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.695
and it's someone else's turn.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.031
He is an absolute mess, Karen.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.366
I know.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.801
Believe me, I have 16 years'
experience in the field.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.371
To be honest, I-I-I've never
seen anything like it.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.206
I-I don't think
I can help him.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.907
I don't think
he even wants to be helped.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.509
I think
he wants to be punished.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.878
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.213
You're smart.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.848
That's why he needs you.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.017
I don't mean to be rude,
but I-I have to ask.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.686
How in the hell
did you put up with this

20:54.720 --> 20:56.354
for as long as you did?

20:56.389 --> 20:58.790
That's a good question.
That's a very good question.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.792
I don't even know
if I have an answer.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.762
Um...

21:03.796 --> 21:05.730
I think the world sees Hank

21:05.765 --> 21:08.500
as this fabulous fuck-up.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.336
And, um, I know that guy.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.805
I've spent a lot of time
with that guy.

21:13.839 --> 21:17.809
But I am better acquainted
with the other guy...

21:17.843 --> 21:22.614
The one that listens
and hears everything,

21:22.648 --> 21:26.851
the one that looks at you
and sees right into your soul,

21:26.886 --> 21:30.722
the one that makes you believe
in every fucking fairy tale

21:30.756 --> 21:32.924
that you've ever been told.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.727
Ultimately, I may not
even be the woman

21:35.761 --> 21:38.496
who gets to enjoy the man
that I know he can be,

21:38.531 --> 21:40.565
but I still want
the best for him,

21:40.599 --> 21:42.567
because I want the best
for my daughter.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.107
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean
to lay all this on you.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.410
I-it's okay.
I appreciate your candor, I do.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.113
Nice to meet you.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.749
Yeah, nice to meet you.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.322
So I'm the guy you call

22:04.356 --> 22:05.857
when you think your mother's
gonna have a shit fit?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.725
Otherwise you don't want
to have anything to do with me?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.695
I just thought
you'd understand.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.030
You have tattoos.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.199
- Mom has tattoos.
- That's not the point.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.900
What is the point, then?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.969
These are my friends.
They wanted me to do it.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.505
Yeah, and if your friends
wanted you to do drugs,

22:20.539 --> 22:22.040
would you do that?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.875
Of course I would.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.477
Wouldn't you?

22:25.511 --> 22:29.080
A little bit of hypocrisy
is fine, dad,

22:29.114 --> 22:31.115
but I'm the normal one here.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.486
I'm supposed to be out getting
fucked up with my friends.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.522
You're supposed to be home
watching TV with mom.

22:37.556 --> 22:40.191
Instead you're out there
fucking teenagers

22:40.226 --> 22:43.728
and prancing around
like a poor man's Bukowski.

22:43.762 --> 22:47.765
I'm sorry I called you.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.868
Hey, hey.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.170
Take it easy
on your old man, okay?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.105
He's as cool as they come.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.540
Really?

22:55.574 --> 22:58.476
Yeah, that's why I'm gonna
play him in a movie.

22:58.511 --> 22:59.811
Really?

22:59.845 --> 23:01.746
You already said that.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.615
You know who should play you?

23:03.649 --> 23:05.183
K-stew.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.118
I should give her a call.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.693
- I should fucking hit you.
- Yeah, take a shot.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.495
I'll hit you right back,
you fucking nutter.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.497
I said I should.
I didn't say I was gonna.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.432
But I am gonna do your movie.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.234
Why?

23:23.269 --> 23:25.837
Because now I know
what it's about.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.073
And it sure the fuck isn't
about warm, wet pussy.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.909
It's about a guy
trying to keep it together

23:30.943 --> 23:33.278
while falling apart.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.179
It's about life, love, sex,

23:35.214 --> 23:38.850
and the ever-lurking presence
of the grim fucking reaper.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.952
It's about men...

23:40.986 --> 23:43.688
Husbands, wives...

23:43.722 --> 23:45.823
Daughters, and fathers.

23:45.891 --> 23:50.228
It's Cassavetes
meets Judy Blume!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.030
It's about
the motherfucking dark side.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.666
You and the motherfucking
dark side.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.867
Come here.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.503
Come on.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.905
Come here, pussy fart.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.009
Get in on this.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.053
Whoa.
Yeah, hell.

24:15.087 --> 24:18.222
Some got to win,
and some got to lose there, yep.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.826
If the bull don't kill him,
the clowns will.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.997
Whoa.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.666
What's all this, then, Stu?

24:28.701 --> 24:31.336
I'm making my move.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.671
- Seriously?
- This is it.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.939
That's your move,

24:34.974 --> 24:38.176
the old "fake yawn,
surreptitious grope" combo?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.845
- It's a classic.
- It's a clam, Stu.

24:40.879 --> 24:41.946
The next thing I know,

24:41.981 --> 24:43.214
you're gonna be
sticking your dick

24:43.248 --> 24:45.183
up through the bottom
of that tub of popcorn,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.784
<i>diner</i> style.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.119
Would that have worked?

24:48.153 --> 24:51.089
Wouldn't you like to know, Stu?

24:51.123 --> 24:54.125
Actually, I would.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.327
I have to be honest
with you, Marcy.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.062
I suck with women.

24:58.097 --> 25:01.399
Ask my first three wives.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.936
But I like you,

25:04.970 --> 25:08.206
and, um,
thanks for hanging out.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.675
And it's been a wonderful day.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.877
Aw, sweet.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.413
Oh, okay.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.830
You're mean.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.799
Why do you say that?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.668
You fire me in the morning,
then you strut your stuff

25:36.702 --> 25:38.136
in my neck of the woods
in the evening...

25:38.170 --> 25:40.304
Cruel and unusual, counselor.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.173
Life goes on, Hank.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.841
So it does.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.143
I'm sorry, by the way.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.411
For what?

25:46.445 --> 25:49.047
I know I can be a world-class
stone in your shoe.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.683
I make life pretty fucking
impossible for those around me.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.118
It's an issue.
I'm working on it, whatever.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.854
Tomorrow's another day.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.857
Have fun on your "date."

25:59.892 --> 26:03.695
Who says I'm on a date?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.496
Maybe I came here to see you.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.699
Really?
Why?

26:07.733 --> 26:11.836
Maybe I was a little rash
this morning.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.871
I-I get it.
I bring it out in people...

26:13.906 --> 26:15.506
Rashes and whatnot.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.676
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

26:18.711 --> 26:22.013
Depends what you think
I'm saying.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.015
That you're my lawyer again.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.416
Maybe.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.218
Tomorrow's another day.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.486
Tomorrow?

26:28.520 --> 26:31.556
Yeah, there's not a lot
of legal work

26:31.590 --> 26:32.790
I can do for you tonight.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.562
Right, so... so...
so technically,

26:37.596 --> 26:40.665
you're not my lawyer right now?

26:40.699 --> 26:44.368
Technically, uh, no, I'm not.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.704
Right now I'm just
a girl in a bar.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.910
Hmm, that's funny,

26:52.945 --> 26:55.012
'cause right now
I'm just a guy in a bar.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.415
That is funny.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.751
Well, it's nice to meet you.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.819
Hank Moody.

27:01.854 --> 27:02.820
- Abby.
- Abby?

27:02.855 --> 27:03.988
- Mm-hmm.
- Abby.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.491
Well, nice to meet you.
