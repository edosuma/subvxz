I'm going to skate with him.

It's been, like, a day.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.354
I didn't realize you were
in so much of a hurry.

13:33.437 --> 13:36.357
I don't know. I figured
after you pushed me, screamed at me,

13:36.440 --> 13:38.734
and basically told me
that you'd never ever skate with me

13:38.818 --> 13:42.071
that you would, in fact,
never ever skate with me.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.783

in the world,

13:45.866 --> 13:47.660

13:47.743 --> 13:49.370
Well, I changed my mind.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.289
Fuck, I gave up everything to do this.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.709
Well, I guess you're shit outta luck, huh?

13:55.793 --> 13:56.710
Sorry.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.629
Fine.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.339
This was a mistake.

14:11.725 --> 14:15.187
[Jenn] And, uh, yeah, I mean,
it's pretty straightforward. Uh...

14:15.271 --> 14:17.940
Back there are the vending machines.

-Thanks.
-Yup.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.742
Oh, and, just so you know, my friend Kat
was always supposed to skate with Justin,

14:28.826 --> 14:32.037
so I think it might be
in your best interest

14:32.121 --> 14:33.789
to get the fuck out of her way.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.083

14:37.293 --> 14:38.127
You know,

14:38.210 --> 14:41.046
the way I heard it was
she already had her chance.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.090
And, unlike your friend,

14:43.173 --> 14:44.884
I have all my triple jumps.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.427
So...

15:33.724 --> 15:37.269
I just wanna make sure
that Kat's behavior...

15:37.895 --> 15:38.896
um...

15:38.979 --> 15:42.274
hasn't influenced Serena's trial period.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.526
I'm just so sorry
about what happened the other night.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.278
I can't believe she did that.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.697
No, no, no.
Please, think nothing of it. Yeah.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.824
Kat's behavior is no reflection on Serena.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.451
Okay, good.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.828
-Thank you for being so understanding.
-No, of course.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.831
And just know that I've set
very strict boundaries for Kat.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.918
And she knows not to interfere
with Serena's training ever again.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.044
No, I appreciate that.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.505
It's important that Serena
trusts me completely,

16:04.588 --> 16:06.340
without any distractions.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.092
-Yeah, of course.
-Hm.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.134
Okay.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.357
[inhales sharply]

16:23.440 --> 16:25.651
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.319
It's just stiff.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.919
-[Dasha] Are you okay?
-[Leah] No, I'm not okay!

16:45.254 --> 16:47.047
[Dasha] What? What happened?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.091
[Leah] Are you serious?
What are you doing?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.176
[indistinct conversation]

16:53.178 --> 16:55.723
-[Justin] Leah, calm down.
-[Dasha] Leah, stop.

16:59.893 --> 17:00.769
[Leah] No, stop!

17:00.853 --> 17:03.230
You don't understand what's happening!
It's not fair!

17:03.313 --> 17:05.274
I'm not gonna tolerate this!
This is a joke!

17:18.495 --> 17:19.872
Three Macallans on the rocks,

17:20.414 --> 17:23.584
two G&Ts and a red beer.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.335
A red beer? Seriously?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.838
-Hm-mm. Tomato juice and--
-Light beer.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.382
Otherwise known as horse piss
with the foam farted off.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.467
[snorts]

17:32.509 --> 17:35.220
I guess the country cousin
got invited to lunch today, huh?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.138
Yeah.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.683
-You know that's my mom's drink?
-Really? [laughs]

17:42.352 --> 17:44.313
So... when are you headed to London?

17:46.648 --> 17:47.483
I'm not.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.278
Or maybe I am.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.114
I mean, I'm not sure.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.329
Had a fight with my mom,
and now I have no place to stay.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.414
So my life's a mess,

18:02.998 --> 18:04.833
and I'm completely fucked.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.959
Aargh!

18:06.043 --> 18:07.044
[chuckles]

18:12.341 --> 18:14.009
[cell phone buzzing]

18:15.803 --> 18:16.929
[Marcus clears throat]

18:37.658 --> 18:39.243
[sighs]

18:43.497 --> 18:44.498
[sniffs]

18:46.125 --> 18:49.086
Hey, Kat. Kat, don't be upset, okay?

18:49.586 --> 18:50.420
I mean,

18:50.504 --> 18:53.173
get upset,
if that's what you wanna do, but...

18:54.007 --> 18:56.176
you can always just squat
in the staff room.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.180
One of the perks of being the manager
is that I'm the only one with the key.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.561
Look, nobody will know
if it's only a few nights.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.231
How much are you gonna judge me
if I accept your offer?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.108
[chuckles]

19:12.526 --> 19:13.527
A lot.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.947
I'm gonna judge you a lot.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.495
Great.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.289
Then I accept.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.833
Great.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.135
[sniffs]

19:41.388 --> 19:42.389
[laughs]

19:46.143 --> 19:47.978
It's no red beer, but...

19:51.231 --> 19:52.733
maybe it'll take the edge off.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.069
Cheers.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.824
Like a moth to a flame.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.951
I need Kat for a second.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.369
[Jenn] Actually...

20:05.579 --> 20:07.331
more like an hour. Let's go.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.249
It's fine.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.959
Okay. Bye.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.923
I know how you're gonna get Justin
to skate with you.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.926
All you have to do is land a triple toe
right in front of his face.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.219
That's <i>all </i>I have to do?

20:20.719 --> 20:23.555
Look, I've been watching
Justin and Leah skate.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.849
It's so obvious that he hates her,

20:25.933 --> 20:28.018
and she can't land a triple toe
to save her life.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.312
That was always your
most consistent triple.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.648
Until I stopped doing triple jumps.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.651
-I haven't even tried one since--
-He wanted you first.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.861
He only went to Leah
when you stopped being an option.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.571
Show him you're still an option.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.240
Also,

20:41.657 --> 20:43.075
I hate Leah so much.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.076
Seriously, like,

20:44.159 --> 20:45.827
so, so much.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.329
You have to do it, okay?

20:48.163 --> 20:50.165
Come on! Let's go!

20:51.416 --> 20:52.793
[Jenn] It's fine. Let's go.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.558
[Dasha] And hand extension. Lift!
Excellent.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.645
Tuck your right foot. Very good.
And extend.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.189
Very nice.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.400
Okay, I really need...

21:19.528 --> 21:20.696
Jenn! What the--

21:20.779 --> 21:22.614
You're gonna tell me
if Kat does her triple toe

21:22.698 --> 21:24.866
or freaks out and doesn't rotate.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.619
So, basically, if she pops it?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.037
Yup.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.289
[laughs] No.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.847
[Kat] Damn it!

21:54.521 --> 21:55.355
[grunts]

21:55.897 --> 21:56.815
And a...

22:00.986 --> 22:03.613
[Dasha] Excellent.
And Justin, make sure you're--

22:03.697 --> 22:04.865
What is she doing?

22:06.408 --> 22:07.242
[Leah] Hey.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.453
-Eyes here.
-Yeah.

22:10.120 --> 22:10.996
So?

22:11.538 --> 22:13.582
She popped it like a million times.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.083
Shit.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.545
[Dasha] Grand plié.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.847
[Justin] Was that meant for me?

22:30.724 --> 22:33.560
Because, if so,
I found it very, very sexy.

22:34.853 --> 22:35.812
Shut up.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.731
I know what you were
trying to do out there.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.192
-Do you?
-Yeah.

22:40.275 --> 22:43.111
Started to figure it out
after the fifth failed attempt.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.197
-Hm.
-Or was it the sixth?

22:45.739 --> 22:46.740
Ouch.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.244
You know, it's actually my dad
you'd have to impress, not me.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.038
He's the one paying all the bills.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.248
Well, how the hell do I do that?

22:55.957 --> 22:58.293
I wish I could tell ya
'cause I've never done it.

23:02.130 --> 23:02.964
See you around.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.720
[sighs]

23:08.804 --> 23:10.555
[door closes]

23:10.639 --> 23:12.224
[Mandy] All right, let's bow our heads.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.309
Lord, we'd like to show our thanks

23:14.393 --> 23:16.978
for how quickly the clubhouse renovation
is proceeding.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.939
And thank you for these well-behaved boys

23:19.022 --> 23:21.608
that are keeping their hands
to their damn selves.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.861
And thank you for Reid
finally passing algebra.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.114
After all, C's get degrees, y'all.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.868
And Lord, give Justin
some god-like patience

23:31.952 --> 23:34.704
with his new, spirited partner.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.665
Bless her little heart. Amen.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.083
[all] Amen.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.211
Spirited, huh?

23:42.629 --> 23:44.256
Everything all right with you and Leah?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.425
You haven't screwed things up
with her yet, have you?

23:46.508 --> 23:49.344
Oh, I can assure you, darling,
from what I've heard,

23:49.428 --> 23:51.805
Justin is definitely not the one
at fault there.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.974
Oh, yeah? What's going on?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.184
Leah's a handful.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.853
-I think she's hot.
-Shut up, Reid.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.146
-Shut up, Reid.
-Shut up, Reid.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.941
Can you win with her?

24:06.570 --> 24:09.448
Yeah. We've a shot
at doing pretty well this season.

24:16.746 --> 24:17.998
[cutlery clatters]

24:18.081 --> 24:19.291
I wanna skate with Kat.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.545
-Didn't she turn you down?
-She changed her mind.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.213
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.048
Because we already made a commitment

24:27.132 --> 24:28.592
to Leah and her mother.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.553
And you said yourself
you think you can win with her.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.055
As far as I'm concerned,
that's good business.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.017
-But Dad, I'm telling you--
-I'm done talkin' about it, Justin.

24:39.144 --> 24:39.978
[Justin sighs]

24:42.230 --> 24:43.190
Yes, sir.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.321
[Mandy clears throat]

25:06.338 --> 25:07.297
[box snaps shut]

25:32.697 --> 25:33.657
[moaning]

25:33.740 --> 25:36.117
[cell phone ringing]

25:46.878 --> 25:47.879
[sighs]

25:48.755 --> 25:49.589
Hi.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.175
[Dave] <i>Are you coming to London or not?</i>

25:54.803 --> 25:55.637
I can't.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.848
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Kat, there's nothing keeping you there.</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:02.852
There's nothing for me in London, either.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.854
[scoffs] <i>Wow.</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:10.986
I think this has to be the end for us.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.030
-I'm sorry. I--
-[call ends]

26:19.744 --> 26:20.745
[sighs]

26:32.382 --> 26:34.384
[cash register beeping]

26:40.390 --> 26:41.433
Thanks.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.186
How's it going?

26:46.104 --> 26:47.188
Find a place to stay?

26:47.772 --> 26:48.773
Yeah.

26:48.857 --> 26:49.691
Kinda.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.860
That's good, I guess.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.905
So do you, like, know what you're doing,

26:55.989 --> 26:57.782
or have a plan or whatever?

26:59.034 --> 26:59.868
No.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.703
No, not at all.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.248
Maybe for the first time in my life,
actually.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.834
Must be weird.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.210
Yeah.

27:09.919 --> 27:10.920
It really is.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.467
Look, I just needed to tell you...

27:16.343 --> 27:17.886
no matter what happens,

27:18.428 --> 27:20.555
I need to keep seeing you, okay?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.557
-Being in your life--
-Look, Kat...

27:24.225 --> 27:26.728
I don't mean to be a bitch, okay? But...

27:28.188 --> 27:31.775
things have gotten a little
less complicated at home since you left.

27:33.193 --> 27:36.404
I don't know.
It's like Mom is in a good mood for once,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.740
which I never get to see.

27:38.823 --> 27:39.658
So...

27:43.119 --> 27:44.329
What does that mean?

27:45.372 --> 27:48.375
Maybe we should just take some space.
You know?

27:50.377 --> 27:51.378
[Carol] Serena!

27:52.504 --> 27:55.924
You promised Mitch you would
practice your off-ice double axel today.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.347
Go on, sweetheart.

28:05.892 --> 28:06.893
I'm sorry.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.035
[sighs]

28:24.119 --> 28:26.162
She just shouldn't be
treating you like this, honey.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.206
-Uh-uh.
-I know.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.209
It's my fault.
I let her get away with too much.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.587
We give everything to these kids,
and they never thank us.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.174
Karen Duncan and her daughter
haven't spoken in ten years.

28:38.675 --> 28:42.137
And that's after Karen took out
a second mortgage on their house

28:42.220 --> 28:43.471
to pay for her ice time.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.265
So sad.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.186
All I have to say
is thank God you still have Serena.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.355
Yeah.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.240
Kat, wait!

29:03.199 --> 29:04.159
Kat!

29:05.535 --> 29:06.536
Mom, don't.

29:06.619 --> 29:07.787
-Wait!
-Not today.

29:07.871 --> 29:08.788
Kat!

29:10.790 --> 29:11.624
[sighs]

29:12.292 --> 29:14.169
It's time for you to come back home.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.467
Look...

29:22.469 --> 29:24.679
I'm going back on my lithium anyway,

29:24.763 --> 29:26.014
so you don't have to...

29:26.723 --> 29:28.141
worry that I'm gonna...

29:30.185 --> 29:32.604
freak out at you,
or whatever you think I did.

29:35.857 --> 29:36.816
Come on, honey.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.486
Let's just put this behind us.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.654
I want you home.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.577
And things are gonna get better,
I promise.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.954
No, they're not.

29:50.038 --> 29:50.872
They will.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.834
And this time it's gonna be different.
I'm gonna get better.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.419
Except you're not.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.672
You may have given me your disorder,
but...

30:00.381 --> 30:03.676
there is no way in hell
I'm gonna end up like you.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.723
And if I stay at home, I know I will.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.069
Remember when you did
