01:56.783 --> 01:59.036
Our pasta this evening...

01:59.119 --> 02:01.705
is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...

02:01.788 --> 02:06.001
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.463
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade,

02:09.545 --> 02:12.883
rare roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.178
...and grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.057
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

02:24.561 --> 02:28.774
God, I hate this place. It's a chick's
restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia ?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.859
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.948
Is that Reed Robinson
over there ?

02:36.031 --> 02:39.076
- Are you freebasing or what ?
That's not Robinson. Well, who is it then ?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.120
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.581
Paul Allen's on the other side
of the room over there.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.667
Who's he with ?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.585
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.547
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there ?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.132
- He's handling the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

02:54.216 --> 02:58.637
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything ?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.639
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

03:00.722 --> 03:02.808
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.352
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.354
Oh, my God, Bateman.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.440
Do you want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?

03:10.524 --> 03:14.194
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

03:14.278 --> 03:18.407
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.368
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.913
Speaking of reasonable--
Only $570.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.958
That's not bad.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.085
A little something
for the purse.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.087
Give her the 50.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.086
Stoli on the rocks.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.507
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.884
That'll be $25.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.097
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.808
I wanna stab you to death...

04:26.850 --> 04:29.436
and play around
with your blood.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.324
What can I get
for you two ?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.184
I live in the
American Gardens building...

05:09.226 --> 05:11.770
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.982
My name is Patrick Bateman.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.984
I'm 27 years old.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.362
I believe in
taking care of myself,

05:20.404 --> 05:25.367
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.828
ln the morning,
if my face is a little pufffy,

05:27.911 --> 05:30.998
I'll put on an icepack
while doing my stomach crunches.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.000
I can do a thousand now.

05:50.225 --> 05:54.563
After I remove the icepack,
I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.900
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.571
Then
a honey-almond bodyscrub.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.408
And on the face,
an exfoliating gelscrub.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.420
Then I apply
an herb mint facialmasque,

06:18.462 --> 06:22.508
which lleave on forten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

06:24.635 --> 06:29.097
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

06:29.139 --> 06:32.935
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.978
Then moisturizer,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.022
then an anti-aging eye balm,

06:37.105 --> 06:40.609
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.280
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

06:45.364 --> 06:49.493
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.496
Only an entity--
something illusory.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.123
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

06:55.165 --> 06:58.377
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

06:58.460 --> 07:03.257
and may be you can even sense
our life styles are probably comparable,

07:03.340 --> 07:06.635
I simply am not there.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.535
Good morning.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.788
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.547
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?

07:43.630 --> 07:47.134
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.637
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?

07:50.721 --> 07:53.974
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties, Pier 17. When ?

07:54.057 --> 07:57.102
After 6:00.
And what should I say ? Negative. Cancel it.

07:57.186 --> 08:01.023
Just say "no"
Just say "no" ?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.816
Okay, Jean.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.402
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.404
and if not there
try Crayons.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.990
Allright ?
Yes, sir.

08:10.073 --> 08:15.454
Oh, wait. And I need reservations
for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.456
Something romantic ?

08:18.582 --> 08:20.626
No.

08:20.709 --> 08:24.171
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.215
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.469
Be a doll and just get me a mineral
water, okay ? You look nice today.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.138
Don't wear that outfit again.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.182
What ? I didn't hear you.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.893
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.979
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.316
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.819
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.

08:47.903 --> 08:52.658
And high heels.
I like high heels.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.458
Feathered friends for 600.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.836
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

09:03.919 --> 09:06.755
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.605
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.024
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

09:26.108 --> 09:28.485
Godiva, and oysters
in the halfshell.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.488
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

09:31.530 --> 09:35.993
but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.454
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.832
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.127
Patrick,
we should do it.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.630
Do what ?
Get married. Have a wedding.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.883
No. I can't take
the time off work.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.385
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.180
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.182
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

09:58.265 --> 10:02.769
Because I want to fit in.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.991
Williams party.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.036
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.080
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

10:22.164 --> 10:26.668
But we do, and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

10:26.710 --> 10:31.006
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.383
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

10:33.467 --> 10:37.012
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.349
Okay. Allright.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.476
I'm fairly certain that...

10:42.559 --> 10:45.938
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.857
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

10:48.941 --> 10:52.402
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

10:52.444 --> 10:57.533
I'm having an affair with Courtney
Rawlinson, her closest friend.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.576
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.205
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.707
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.919
More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged...

11:09.002 --> 11:12.548
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus
in the business.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.883
Tell me, Stash.

11:14.967 --> 11:18.512
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial ?

11:18.595 --> 11:21.890
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?

11:21.974 --> 11:23.934
Hey, that affects us.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.980
Well, what about the massacres in Sri
Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?

11:28.063 --> 11:29.982
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka ?

11:30.065 --> 11:32.150
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there ?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.236
Come on, Bryce.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.656
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

11:37.739 --> 11:41.326
- Like what ?
- Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

11:41.410 --> 11:46.748
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

11:46.832 --> 11:50.627
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless...

11:50.711 --> 11:54.923
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.801
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.262
We have to encourage
a return...

12:00.304 --> 12:02.973
to traditional moral values.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.434
Most importantly,

12:05.517 --> 12:09.813
we have to promote
general social concern...

12:09.897 --> 12:13.775
and less materialism
in young people.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.613
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.984
Hello.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.780
Hello.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.509
Bleaching ? Are you
trying to say "bleaching" ?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.511
Oh, my God.
Two things.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.513
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.516
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.560
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.188
Lady, if you don't shut your
fucking mouth, I will kill you.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.815
Now, listen.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.442
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.444
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.865
Listen, I can't understand you !
This is crazy ! You're a fool.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.908
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee" !

13:44.992 --> 13:47.494
Understand ?
Christ. Patrick ?

13:47.578 --> 13:50.038
Hi, Patrick.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.250
I thought that was you.
Hello. This is--

13:53.333 --> 13:56.670
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ?
They really are the best.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.755
Then why can't they
get these stains out ?

13:58.839 --> 14:02.259
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.262
- Oh, what are those ?
- Well, it's--

14:05.345 --> 14:08.515
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple.
- Really ?

14:08.557 --> 14:11.351
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.521
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.899
Hubert's ?
That moved uptown, right ? Oh, boy.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.234
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.278
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.948
I'm downtown quite often. What about
a Saturday ? I'm at work all the time.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.619
Next Saturday ?
Can't, I'm afraid. Sure.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.871
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.750
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you. Okay. Do.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.835
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.837
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.756
What could you possibly
be up to tonight ?

14:40.839 --> 14:43.675
Stop it. I'm--
On a lot of lithium ?

14:43.759 --> 14:47.054
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.724
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.603
Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.815
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.985
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay ?

15:02.069 --> 15:05.447
I have to go.
Courtney ?

15:05.531 --> 15:07.449
Hmm ?
Dinner.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.077
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.499
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.584
Oh,yeah !

15:27.010 --> 15:29.847
Dorsia.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.099
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

15:32.140 --> 15:36.812
but is it possible to reserve a
table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?

15:53.996 --> 15:57.457
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.752
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

16:00.836 --> 16:04.173
where I got this little...

16:04.214 --> 16:07.634
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car ?

16:07.676 --> 16:09.720
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.556
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.517
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

16:15.601 --> 16:18.312
I just want a child.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.981
Just two...

16:21.064 --> 16:23.609
perfect...

16:23.692 --> 16:26.028
children.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.743
Are we here ?
Yeah.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.712
This is Dorsia ?
Yes, dear.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.507
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

16:46.590 --> 16:49.176
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

16:49.259 --> 16:53.138
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but mysterious little dish."

16:53.222 --> 16:57.059
You'll love it. And then the red
snapper with violets and pine nuts.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.061
I think that'll
follow nicely.

16:59.144 --> 17:02.940
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.990
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.910
Dorsia.
How impressive.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.204
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there ?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.540
Lucky, I guess.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.583
That's a wonderful suit.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.961
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.047
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

17:27.089 --> 17:29.216
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

17:29.258 --> 17:32.386
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

17:34.221 --> 17:39.309
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you ?

17:39.393 --> 17:42.688
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.357
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

17:45.440 --> 17:47.901
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

17:47.943 --> 17:51.947
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.949
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

17:54.032 --> 17:56.243
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.663
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ?
- It's, uh, all right.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.082
Really ? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.835
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia ?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.588
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

18:07.671 --> 18:10.757
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.

18:10.841 --> 18:14.303
- Thankyou, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.643
Call me.
How about Friday ?

18:21.727 --> 18:26.148
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.693
Greatsea urchin ceviche.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.778
Dorsia on Friday night ?
How'd he swing that ?

18:31.862 --> 18:33.864
I think he's lying.

18:36.325 --> 18:39.661
- Is that a gram ?
- New card.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.664
What do you think ?

18:42.748 --> 18:45.334
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

18:45.417 --> 18:49.338
Look at that. Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.340
Good coloring.
That's bone.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.967
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

18:54.009 --> 18:57.513
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing. Look at this.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.973
That is really nice.

19:00.015 --> 19:03.977
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think ?

19:04.019 --> 19:06.897
Nice.

19:06.980 --> 19:11.485
Jesus. That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?

19:11.568 --> 19:14.071
I can't believe that Bryce...

19:14.154 --> 19:17.074
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.035
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

19:21.787 --> 19:27.376
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.003
Impressive.
Very nice.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.130
Hmm.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.424
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.858
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.819
The tasteful thickness of it.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.114
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.371
Is something wrong,
Patrick ?

20:04.454 --> 20:06.415
You're sweating.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.529
Hello. Pat Bateman.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.615
You want some, uh, money ?

20:39.698 --> 20:41.617
Some food ?

20:43.952 --> 20:46.455
- Is this what you need ?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

20:46.497 --> 20:48.457
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it ?

20:53.295 --> 20:56.590
Why don't you get a job ?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?

20:56.632 --> 20:58.634
I lost my job.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.677
Why ? You drinking ?

21:00.802 --> 21:04.473
Is that why you lost it ?
Insider trading ?

21:04.556 --> 21:06.767
Just joking.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.937
Listen, what's your name ?
Al.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.980
Hmm ? Speak up.
Come on. Al.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.274
Get a goddamn job, Al.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.486
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

21:17.569 --> 21:21.114
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

21:21.198 --> 21:24.993
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-- You're a kind man.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.995
It's okay.
I can tell.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.415
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do. You gotta help me.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.460
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.129
You know how bad you smell ?

21:36.171 --> 21:39.299
You reek of shit.
Do you know that ?

21:39.383 --> 21:42.719
Al.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.806
I'm sorry.
It's just that--

21:45.848 --> 21:47.808
I don't know.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.436
I don't have anything
in common with you.

21:59.695 --> 22:02.322
Oh. Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.534
I'm cold out here.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.536
You know what a fucking loser you are ?
What ?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.856
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

22:35.939 --> 22:39.151
So fine,
so smooth.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.203
I have all the characteristics
of a human being--

22:49.244 --> 22:52.873
flesh, blood, skin, hair--

22:52.915 --> 22:56.210
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

22:56.251 --> 22:59.713
except for greed and disgust.

22:59.755 --> 23:02.424
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

23:02.508 --> 23:04.426
and I don't know why.

23:05.928 --> 23:09.640
My nightly bloodlust
has overflowed into my days.

23:09.723 --> 23:13.435
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.730
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.037
Hey, Mc Cloy,
what do you say ?

23:32.120 --> 23:34.581
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

23:34.665 --> 23:38.919
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account ?
Ofcourse. Who else ?

23:39.002 --> 23:41.964
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.591
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.927
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm not late.

23:46.969 --> 23:50.097
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

23:50.180 --> 23:54.268
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

23:54.351 --> 23:57.813
What is it ?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?

23:57.855 --> 24:00.315
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.734
They make darling pets.
Don't you ?

24:02.818 --> 24:05.112
Don't you ?

24:05.195 --> 24:08.240
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.534
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas ?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.870
And don't say
breast implants again.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.458
Allen. Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.628
How you been ? Workaholic, I suppose ?
Haven't seen you in a while.

24:21.712 --> 24:25.799
Hey, Hamilton. We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

24:25.841 --> 24:29.136
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring--

24:29.219 --> 24:32.097
Cecilla ?
Yes, Cecilla.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.474
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.186
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.271
Great party.
Thanks.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.523
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus ?

24:41.607 --> 24:44.234
Mistletoe alert.

24:52.534 --> 24:55.078
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

24:57.247 --> 25:00.834
No, l want to know, okay ?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

25:00.876 --> 25:04.505
which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

25:04.588 --> 25:07.007
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

25:07.049 --> 25:10.552
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight, and a Corona.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.347
Would you like to hear--
Double Absolut martini.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.474
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials ?

25:15.557 --> 25:17.976
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

25:21.438 --> 25:25.067
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

25:25.150 --> 25:29.029
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...

25:29.071 --> 25:31.031
are outrageous here.

25:31.073 --> 25:33.408
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.036
Give me a break.

25:36.078 --> 25:41.375
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O. We should've gone to Dorsia.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.127
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

25:45.921 --> 25:48.882
Is that Ivana Trump ?

25:48.924 --> 25:52.845
Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking ?

25:52.928 --> 25:56.682
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana ?

25:56.765 --> 26:00.769
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account ?

26:00.853 --> 26:05.440
How'd you get it ?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

26:05.524 --> 26:07.860
but then I'd have to
kill you.

26:14.533 --> 26:18.412
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane ?

26:21.373 --> 26:23.709
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.586
Where do you tan ?
Salon.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.921
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

26:27.963 --> 26:31.258
And, uh, Cecilla.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.635
How is she ?
Where is she tonight ?

26:33.719 --> 26:36.638
Cecilla's, uh--
Well, you know Cecilla.

26:36.722 --> 26:39.391
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.311
Evelyn ?
Great ass.

26:42.394 --> 26:46.064
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

26:46.148 --> 26:49.276
Another martini, Paul ?

26:55.032 --> 26:56.992
You like
Huey Lewis and the News ?

26:57.034 --> 26:59.244
Um, they're okay.

27:01.288 --> 27:05.042
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

27:05.125 --> 27:08.086
But when Sports
came out in '83,

27:08.170 --> 27:11.173
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.137
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

27:17.221 --> 27:19.890
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

27:19.973 --> 27:23.185
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.905
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

27:34.988 --> 27:39.660
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.662
Hey, Halberstram ?
Yes, Allen ?

27:41.703 --> 27:44.623
Why are there copies of the Style
section all over the place ?

27:44.706 --> 27:49.545
Do you-- Do you have a dog ?
A little chow or something ?

27:49.586 --> 27:52.506
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat ?

27:52.548 --> 27:54.842
Yes, it is.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.469
In '87, Huey released this--

27:57.553 --> 27:59.471
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

27:59.555 --> 28:03.225
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square."

28:03.308 --> 28:06.061
The song's so catchy, most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.605
But they should,
because it's not just about...

28:08.689 --> 28:11.567
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

28:11.650 --> 28:15.863
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself. Hey, Paul !

28:21.285 --> 28:24.413
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

28:24.496 --> 28:27.583
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

28:27.666 --> 28:31.628
You fucking bastard !

29:30.896 --> 29:34.483
He was completely naked
and standing up on the table.

29:34.566 --> 29:37.027
He had no clothes on
what so ever, and he--

29:37.110 --> 29:39.029
Patrick ?
Patrick.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.698
Is that you ?

29:41.782 --> 29:45.035
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

29:45.118 --> 29:47.204
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

29:47.287 --> 29:51.458
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.294
Ooh.

29:55.838 --> 29:57.756
Where did you get
that overnight bag ?

30:00.300 --> 30:02.219
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.399
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

30:15.482 --> 30:17.442
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

30:17.526 --> 30:19.528
before disposing
of the body.

30:19.611 --> 30:22.739
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

30:22.823 --> 30:27.202
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

30:27.286 --> 30:29.955
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.919
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

30:36.003 --> 30:39.173
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

30:39.214 --> 30:42.050
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

30:44.928 --> 30:47.181
Where do I send the bastard ?

30:47.222 --> 30:49.224
Dallas ?

30:49.266 --> 30:51.810
Paris ? Singapore ?

30:51.894 --> 30:55.022
London ? I'll send
the asshole to London.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.530
Hi. This is Paul.

31:03.572 --> 31:05.699
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

31:05.741 --> 31:09.036
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.563
What is it ?

31:36.605 --> 31:40.317
Patrick.
Yes, Jean ?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.570
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you. Who ?

31:43.654 --> 31:46.240
Detective Donald Kimball.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.328
Tell him I'm at lunch.

31:51.411 --> 31:55.874
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

31:55.958 --> 31:58.293
Send him in, I guess.

32:05.300 --> 32:09.179
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

32:09.263 --> 32:13.100
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

32:13.141 --> 32:15.519
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

32:15.602 --> 32:18.021
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

32:18.105 --> 32:21.525
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

32:21.608 --> 32:25.404
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

32:25.487 --> 32:30.159
Just joking. No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.

32:30.242 --> 32:32.161
Okay, John ? Right.

32:32.244 --> 32:35.455
Got it.
Sorry about that.

32:35.497 --> 32:38.125
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.127
Was that anything important ?

32:40.169 --> 32:43.255
Oh, that ?
Just mulling over business problems,

32:43.338 --> 32:47.718
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

32:47.801 --> 32:50.971
Hi.

32:51.054 --> 32:54.016
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.310
Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge
in on you like this.

32:56.351 --> 32:58.395
I know how busy
you guys can get.

33:01.106 --> 33:05.152
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion ?

33:05.235 --> 33:07.696
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

33:07.779 --> 33:10.824
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

33:12.743 --> 33:15.162
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

33:15.204 --> 33:17.331
So it's nothing
that official.

33:17.372 --> 33:20.584
- I just have some questions about
Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?

33:20.667 --> 33:22.794
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris ?

33:22.878 --> 33:24.796
No, I'm okay.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.424
Can you bring Mr.--

33:27.508 --> 33:30.177
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.346
It's no problem.

33:34.681 --> 33:37.142
So, what's the topic
of discussion ?

33:37.226 --> 33:39.937
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

33:40.020 --> 33:43.649
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't--

33:45.567 --> 33:48.362
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

33:48.445 --> 33:50.614
Not on page six, at least.

33:50.697 --> 33:54.368
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime ?

33:54.409 --> 33:58.455
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure ? I can always get you a lime.

33:58.539 --> 34:01.542
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay ?

34:01.625 --> 34:03.585
Shoot.

34:03.627 --> 34:06.129
Hold old are you ?
Twenty-seven.

34:06.213 --> 34:08.130
Where did you go to school ?
Harvard.

34:08.215 --> 34:10.842
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address ?

34:10.926 --> 34:13.136
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

34:13.219 --> 34:16.723
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

34:16.806 --> 34:20.518
What can you tell me about Paul Allen ?
I'm at a loss.

34:20.601 --> 34:23.480
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing" ?

34:23.563 --> 34:26.400
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean, "Yale thing" ?

34:26.440 --> 34:30.404
Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

34:30.487 --> 34:32.447
who did a lot of cocaine.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.574
That "Yale thing."

34:34.658 --> 34:38.871
What kind of man was he, besides
the information you've just given ?

34:38.954 --> 34:41.748
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- You feel like that ?

34:41.790 --> 34:43.917
No, not really.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.838
Where did Paul hang out ?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.840
Hang out ?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

34:49.922 --> 34:54.094
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

34:54.178 --> 34:56.138
Fluties, Indochine,

34:56.179 --> 34:58.140
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

34:58.182 --> 35:00.601
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht ?

35:00.642 --> 35:04.605
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school ?

35:04.688 --> 35:07.191
Don't you know this ?

35:07.274 --> 35:09.234
I just wanted to know
if you know.

35:13.322 --> 35:16.408
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

35:16.492 --> 35:19.453
Listen, I just--
I just wanna help.

35:19.495 --> 35:22.539
I understand.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.960
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints ?

35:27.002 --> 35:31.131
Well, there's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

35:31.215 --> 35:33.759
- Well, maybe he did, huh ?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

35:33.842 --> 35:35.969
- But has anyone seen him in London ?
- Actually, yes.

35:36.053 --> 35:39.306
Hmm. But I've had a hardtime
getting actual verification.

35:39.389 --> 35:43.227
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.229
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

35:45.312 --> 35:47.648
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so--

35:47.689 --> 35:50.984
- Had his apartment been burglarized ?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

35:51.068 --> 35:54.613
Toiletries were missing, a suit was
gone, so was some luggage. That's it.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.115
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet or anything, right ?

35:57.199 --> 35:59.660
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

35:59.701 --> 36:02.079
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.957
So typical, isn't it ?
It's just strange.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.543
One day,
someone's walking around,

36:07.626 --> 36:10.128
going to work, alive,
and then--

36:10.212 --> 36:12.631
Nothing.

36:12.714 --> 36:14.675
People just disappear.

36:14.716 --> 36:18.428
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

36:19.763 --> 36:22.808
Eerie.
Really eerie.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.607
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

36:30.691 --> 36:34.945
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

36:35.028 --> 36:38.991
The Four Seasons ?
Isn't that a little far uptown ?

36:39.074 --> 36:42.452
I mean, aren't you gonna be late ?
No, there's one down here.

36:42.536 --> 36:44.997
Oh, really ? I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

36:45.080 --> 36:49.209
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you, any information--

36:49.293 --> 36:51.962
Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

36:52.045 --> 36:55.674
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

36:59.595 --> 37:01.555
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

38:01.114 --> 38:04.284
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

38:04.326 --> 38:08.747
- Would you like to see my apartment ?
- I'm not supposed to.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.376
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not ?

38:14.837 --> 38:18.966
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

38:20.676 --> 38:22.636
Do you take a credit card ?

38:22.678 --> 38:25.305
I'm joking.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.349
Come on. Get in.

38:37.943 --> 38:39.945
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

38:40.028 --> 38:43.448
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.

38:43.532 --> 38:47.911
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

38:49.538 --> 38:52.666
I'm Paul.

38:52.708 --> 38:55.961
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that ?

38:56.044 --> 38:59.965
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

39:00.048 --> 39:01.967
Is that clear ?

39:12.060 --> 39:14.021
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

39:14.062 --> 39:16.857
I want you
to clean your vagina.

39:25.908 --> 39:29.036
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

39:29.077 --> 39:31.914
You have a very nice body.

39:42.424 --> 39:44.510
Mm-hmm ?

39:44.593 --> 39:47.262
Thank you. Send her up.

39:49.890 --> 39:53.060
Christie,
get out and dry off.

39:53.143 --> 39:56.021
Choose a robe--
not the Bijan--

39:56.104 --> 40:00.567
and come and meet me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.493
You've arrived.
How lovely.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.495
Let me take your coat.

40:11.578 --> 40:14.331
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

40:19.127 --> 40:21.088
Not quite blonde,
are you ?

40:21.129 --> 40:23.090
More dirty blonde.

40:23.131 --> 40:25.634
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

40:25.717 --> 40:27.803
I'm Paul Allen.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.116
So.

40:49.158 --> 40:51.118
Don't you wanna know
what I do ?

40:55.038 --> 40:58.083
No.
No, not really.

40:59.501 --> 41:02.838
Well, I work on Wall Street...

41:02.921 --> 41:05.174
for Pierce & Pierce.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.342
Have you heard of it ?

41:16.435 --> 41:19.229
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

41:19.313 --> 41:21.273
How much
did you pay for it ?

41:21.356 --> 41:23.400
Well, actually,

41:23.484 --> 41:26.320
that's none of your business,
Christie.

41:26.361 --> 41:30.157
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.493
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.039
Varda truffle ?

41:39.541 --> 41:41.835
I don't want you to get drunk,

41:41.919 --> 41:45.255
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.349
Do you like Phil Collins ?

41:55.390 --> 41:57.643
I've been a big Genesis fan
eversince the release...

41:57.726 --> 42:01.730
of their 1980 album Duke.

42:01.813 --> 42:06.527
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.

42:06.610 --> 42:09.655
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

42:09.738 --> 42:12.449
It was on Duke where...

42:12.533 --> 42:15.452
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

42:18.163 --> 42:23.043
I think Invisible Touch is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

42:25.796 --> 42:29.550
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

42:32.469 --> 42:35.305
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

42:35.389 --> 42:38.767
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

42:38.851 --> 42:41.854
Christie,
take off the robe.

42:43.772 --> 42:45.983
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

42:46.066 --> 42:48.694
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

42:48.777 --> 42:53.115
You can practically hear
every nuance of every instrument.

42:53.198 --> 42:55.117
Sabrina, remove your dress.

42:56.827 --> 43:00.289
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

43:00.372 --> 43:03.375
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.878
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

43:07.379 --> 43:09.882
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

43:09.965 --> 43:12.092
In this song,
Phil Collins...

43:12.134 --> 43:16.221
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

43:17.890 --> 43:22.019
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

43:22.102 --> 43:25.397
about monogamy and commitment.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.775
The song is
extremely uplifting.

43:28.817 --> 43:32.237
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

43:32.321 --> 43:36.575
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

43:40.204 --> 43:42.247
Christie,
get down on your knees...

43:42.331 --> 43:45.375
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

43:45.459 --> 43:48.128
Phil Collins' solo career...

43:48.212 --> 43:51.048
seems to be more commercial,

43:51.131 --> 43:54.259
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

43:54.343 --> 43:58.889
especially songs like "In the
Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds."

44:00.849 --> 44:02.809
Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

44:05.187 --> 44:07.856
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

44:07.940 --> 44:11.902
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

44:11.985 --> 44:15.364
And I stress the word "artist."

44:19.368 --> 44:21.286
This is "Sussudio."

44:21.370 --> 44:24.373
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

44:35.217 --> 44:40.889
Look at the camera.

45:14.631 --> 45:18.886
Christie, look at the camera.

45:34.151 --> 45:36.069
Don't touch the watch.

45:58.258 --> 46:00.219
Can we go now ?

46:00.260 --> 46:02.221
We're not through yet.

46:20.239 --> 46:23.617
If they have a good personality and they
are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?

46:23.700 --> 46:25.619
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay ?

46:25.702 --> 46:27.955
What if they have
a good personality ?

46:27.996 --> 46:31.124
I know.
I know.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.794
There are no girls
with good personalities.

46:33.877 --> 46:36.713
A good personality consists
of a chick with a little hard body...

46:36.797 --> 46:38.715
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

46:38.799 --> 46:40.717
without being too slutty
about things...

46:40.801 --> 46:42.719
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

46:42.803 --> 46:44.763
The only girls
with good personalities...

46:44.847 --> 46:48.058
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent or talented--

46:48.141 --> 46:50.978
though God knows what the fuck that means--
are ugly chicks.

46:51.061 --> 46:53.355
Absolutely. And this is because
they have to make up...

46:53.438 --> 46:55.232
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

46:55.315 --> 46:58.527
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?

46:58.610 --> 47:02.573
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say ?

47:02.656 --> 47:05.742
"When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street, I think two things.

47:05.826 --> 47:08.245
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

47:08.328 --> 47:10.789
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

47:10.873 --> 47:13.292
- And what did the other part
of him think ?

47:13.333 --> 47:15.961
What her head would look like
on a stick.

47:20.674 --> 47:24.052
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.

47:25.429 --> 47:27.806
It's my business card.

47:27.848 --> 47:31.268
I decided to get
a new one too.

47:32.811 --> 47:34.730
Oh, it's--

47:34.813 --> 47:36.732
Very nice, Luis.

47:38.358 --> 47:40.194
Thank you.

47:54.041 --> 47:56.168
Listen, what about dinner ?

47:56.210 --> 47:59.046
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten ? "What about fucking dinner" ?

47:59.129 --> 48:02.174
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ?
No shiatsu this morning ?

48:02.216 --> 48:05.511
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw
back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy.

48:05.552 --> 48:07.513
Excuse me.

48:43.924 --> 48:47.845
God. Patrick.
Why here ?

48:47.928 --> 48:50.556
I've seen you
looking at me.

48:50.597 --> 48:53.851
I've noticed your...

48:53.934 --> 48:56.562
hot body.

48:56.603 --> 48:58.647
Don't be shy.

48:58.730 --> 49:00.899
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this--

49:00.941 --> 49:03.610
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

49:03.694 --> 49:06.947
You know, the one you were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

49:10.659 --> 49:14.413
I want you.
I want you too.

49:14.454 --> 49:16.415
Patrick.
What is it ?

49:16.456 --> 49:19.585
Where are you going ?

49:19.626 --> 49:22.462
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

49:29.970 --> 49:33.015
Patrick !

49:56.288 --> 49:58.499
Okay, London the--

49:58.582 --> 50:01.418
London, there's, um, a reservation--
Any Paul Allen ?

50:01.502 --> 50:03.879
No. A reservation, but--
Kimball !

50:03.962 --> 50:06.089
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.

50:06.173 --> 50:08.091
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta ?

50:08.175 --> 50:12.137
Do you remember where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

50:12.179 --> 50:14.139
which was on
the 20th of December ?

50:14.181 --> 50:16.225
God.

50:16.308 --> 50:19.394
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

50:22.856 --> 50:24.817
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

50:24.858 --> 50:27.361
That's not what I've got.
What ?

50:27.444 --> 50:29.822
That's not the information
I've received.

50:29.863 --> 50:32.199
Well, I-- Wait.

50:32.241 --> 50:35.244
- What information have you received ?
- Let me see.

50:35.327 --> 50:38.163
Well--

50:38.205 --> 50:40.165
You were with--
Well, I could be wrong.

50:40.207 --> 50:43.836
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen ?

50:43.919 --> 50:46.171
We'd gone to a new musical...

50:46.213 --> 50:49.800
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

50:49.883 --> 50:52.970
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

50:53.053 --> 50:56.431
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto--
No, Orso's.

50:56.515 --> 50:59.768
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

50:59.852 --> 51:01.812
I'm a little spent now too.

51:01.895 --> 51:05.023
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

51:05.065 --> 51:07.359
when I've sorted out
all this information ?

51:07.401 --> 51:09.361
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

51:09.403 --> 51:12.656
And if you could try and pin down
where you were...

51:12.739 --> 51:16.368
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

51:16.410 --> 51:18.704
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

51:22.332 --> 51:24.251
Huey Lewis and the News.

51:26.920 --> 51:30.215
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it ?

51:31.550 --> 51:35.304
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

51:35.387 --> 51:38.891
Not a big music fan, huh ?
No, I like music.

51:38.932 --> 51:43.645
Just they're--
Huey's too black sounding for me.

51:43.729 --> 51:45.772
To each his own.

51:47.858 --> 51:50.068
So, lunch next week ?

51:50.110 --> 51:52.070
I'll be there.

52:01.121 --> 52:03.165
Oh !

52:03.248 --> 52:05.250
Oh !

52:27.648 --> 52:31.318
Will you call me before Easter ?
Maybe.

52:34.988 --> 52:36.949
What are you doing tonight ?

52:36.990 --> 52:39.827
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

52:39.868 --> 52:43.205
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

52:45.123 --> 52:47.960
I never knew you smoked.

52:48.001 --> 52:49.962
You never noticed.

52:53.215 --> 52:55.509
Listen, Patrick.

52:55.634 --> 52:57.427
Can we talk ?

53:03.475 --> 53:05.853
You look... marvelous.

53:07.855 --> 53:09.815
There's nothing to say.

53:09.857 --> 53:13.443
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special ?

53:14.987 --> 53:16.905
Patrick ?

53:21.410 --> 53:23.370
Yes, Courtney ?

53:25.998 --> 53:28.709
If I don't see you
before Easter,

53:28.792 --> 53:30.878
have a nice one, okay ?

53:35.883 --> 53:37.843
You too.

53:43.599 --> 53:46.143
Patrick ?

53:46.226 --> 53:48.145
Yeah ?

53:49.396 --> 53:54.067
Nothing.

54:20.135 --> 54:22.095
There is this theory now--
Listen to me.

54:22.137 --> 54:24.097
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AlDS virus...

54:24.181 --> 54:27.601
by having sex with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

54:27.643 --> 54:30.979
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

54:31.063 --> 54:33.774
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

54:33.857 --> 54:36.568
I'm not sure, but I don't think
dyslexia is a virus.

54:36.652 --> 54:39.029
But who knows ?
They don't know that.

54:39.112 --> 54:41.031
Prove it.

54:52.626 --> 54:54.545
Oh, God.
What ?

54:54.628 --> 54:58.048
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

54:58.131 --> 55:00.425
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

55:00.467 --> 55:02.636
but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it, we'll be okay.

55:02.719 --> 55:06.181
Can you keep it down ?
I'm trying to do drugs.

55:06.265 --> 55:08.600
Fuck you ! Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

55:08.642 --> 55:10.644
That's right.

55:10.727 --> 55:12.688
That is if the faggot in the next
stall thinks it's okay !

55:12.771 --> 55:14.690
Fuck you !
Hey, fuck you !

55:17.151 --> 55:19.528
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

55:19.611 --> 55:21.989
Okay, let's do it.

55:41.884 --> 55:44.678
Where did Craig go ?

55:44.761 --> 55:48.182
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...

55:48.265 --> 55:50.184
between the United States
and Russia.

55:50.267 --> 55:53.020
He's the one behind Glasnost.

55:53.103 --> 55:56.565
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you ?

55:56.648 --> 55:58.692
No, not really.

55:58.775 --> 56:01.612
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

56:01.695 --> 56:04.364
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

56:04.448 --> 56:06.366
Ask me a question.

56:07.743 --> 56:09.703
So, what do you do ?

56:09.745 --> 56:13.207
I'm into, uh, well, murders
and executions, mostly.

56:13.290 --> 56:17.127
- Do you like it ?
- Well, it depends. Why ?

56:17.211 --> 56:22.466
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions really don't like it.

56:24.885 --> 56:28.472
So, where do you work out ?

56:31.183 --> 56:33.685
You think I'm dumb,
don't you ?

56:33.727 --> 56:36.855
What ? You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

56:36.939 --> 56:39.775
No.
I really don't.

56:39.858 --> 56:42.611
That's okay.
I don't mind.

56:42.694 --> 56:44.613
There's something sweet
about you.

57:11.098 --> 57:13.058
Doin' the crossword ?

57:18.105 --> 57:20.357
You need any help ?

57:30.450 --> 57:33.245
-Jean ?
- Yes, Patrick ?

57:33.287 --> 57:36.623
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner ?

57:36.665 --> 57:39.585
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

57:39.626 --> 57:42.421
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

57:44.673 --> 57:46.633
Well,

57:48.802 --> 57:50.888
isn't this a coincidence ?

57:50.971 --> 57:53.265
Listen, where should we go ?
Anywhere you want.

57:53.307 --> 57:56.310
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want ?

57:58.270 --> 58:00.898
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

58:00.981 --> 58:04.693
Come on.
Where do you wanna go ?

58:04.776 --> 58:09.615
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

58:09.656 --> 58:11.617
What about...

58:19.791 --> 58:21.710
Dorsia ?

58:28.133 --> 58:30.469
So,

58:30.511 --> 58:33.055
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

58:33.138 --> 58:36.767
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

58:36.850 --> 58:38.769
Dorsia is fine.

58:45.150 --> 58:47.069
Dorsia. Yes ?

58:47.152 --> 58:51.323
Yeah, can you take two tonight at,
oh, let's say 9:00 ? We're totally booked.

58:51.365 --> 58:53.325
Really ? That's great.

58:53.367 --> 58:56.912
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00 ? Perfect.

58:56.995 --> 58:58.997
See ya then.

59:01.708 --> 59:04.044
Yeah ?

59:04.086 --> 59:07.548
You're... dressed okay.

59:07.589 --> 59:11.844
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

59:13.011 --> 59:16.640
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

59:16.723 --> 59:19.101
for drinks.

59:19.184 --> 59:21.103
And Jean,

59:21.186 --> 59:23.188
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

59:31.613 --> 59:33.699
Patrick, it's so elegant.

59:33.740 --> 59:35.784
What a wonderful view.

59:35.868 --> 59:38.287
Jean,

59:38.370 --> 59:40.289
sorbet ?

59:41.915 --> 59:44.209
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

59:50.299 --> 59:54.052
Do you want a bite ?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

59:54.136 --> 59:57.598
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right ?

59:57.681 --> 59:59.725
You look great.
Very fit.

01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:04.146
You can always be thinner,
look better.

01:00:04.229 --> 01:00:08.692
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.528
No, it's all right.

01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:15.032
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:19.620
So listen.

01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:22.748
What do you really
wanna do with your life ?

01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:25.083
Just briefly, summarize.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:28.003
And don't tell me you enjoy working
with children, okay ?

01:00:28.086 --> 01:00:32.466
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:35.469
but I don't really know.

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:39.932
I'm at a point in my life where
there seems to be so many possibilities,

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:43.519
but I'm-- I don't know--
I'm just so unsure.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.691
Do you have a boyfriend ?

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:53.529
No, not really.
Interesting.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.241
Are you seeing anyone ?
I mean, seriously ?

01:00:57.324 --> 01:00:59.660
Maybe.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:02.871
I don't know.
Not really.

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:07.918
Jean,

01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:10.671
do you feel... fulfilled ?

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:13.382
I mean, in your life ?

01:01:13.423 --> 01:01:16.426
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

01:01:16.468 --> 01:01:21.598
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself, you know,

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:24.184
developing and growing.

01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:27.479
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:34.153
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:37.406
a collie,
was named Lassie ?

01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:40.909
Had you heard this ?
Who's Ted Bundy ?

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:45.205
Forget it.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:47.916
What's that ?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.963
Duct tape. I need it for, uh,
taping something.

01:01:58.218 --> 01:02:00.721
Patrick,

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:03.599
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy ?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.059
What ? No !
Put it in the carton.

01:02:08.479 --> 01:02:10.772
Sorry.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.566
Jean ?

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:19.114
What ?
Uh, make someone happy ?

01:02:20.449 --> 01:02:22.826
Have you ever wanted to ?

01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:27.664
I'm looking for, uh,

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:34.755
I guess you could say I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:38.675
with someone special.
Hmm.

01:02:46.308 --> 01:02:49.686
Patrick ? Patrick ?
I know you're there.

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.980
Pick up the phone,
you badboy.

01:02:52.022 --> 01:02:56.151
What are you up to tonight ?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

01:02:56.193 --> 01:03:00.405
I hope you're not with some little number
you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman.

01:03:00.489 --> 01:03:03.116
My boy next door.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.619
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

01:03:05.702 --> 01:03:08.205
and I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:10.666
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:13.001
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:15.337
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:17.381
so I'll call you
tomorrowmorning, honey.

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:19.842
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:25.389
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O. Bye-bye.

01:03:28.725 --> 01:03:31.687
Was that Evelyn ?

01:03:34.565 --> 01:03:36.984
Are you still seeing her?

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:44.366
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:51.707
Do you want me to go ?

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:53.709
Yeah.

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:58.505
I don't think
I can control myself.

01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:05.512
I know. I should go. I know I have
a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:09.975
I mean,

01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:13.979
do you want me to go ?

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:17.024
I think if you stay,

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:19.776
something bad will happen.

01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:23.030
I think I might hurt you.

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:26.867
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you ?

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.244
No. No, I guess not.

01:04:30.579 --> 01:04:33.248
I don't wanna get bruised.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:38.128
You're right.
I should go.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.722
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date
tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

01:04:49.807 --> 01:04:52.142
Thanks.

01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:54.520
It slipped my mind completely.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.584
So, the night
he disappeared--

01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:20.420
any new thoughts
about what you did ?

01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:25.843
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:27.845
and some sorbet ?

01:05:27.928 --> 01:05:29.972
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:31.974
But how ?

01:05:32.057 --> 01:05:35.102
Where do you place...
Paul that night ?

01:05:35.185 --> 01:05:38.689
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,

01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:41.692
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:43.986
And ?
I questioned him.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:48.323
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:51.326
But he denied it.
Yes.

01:05:52.536 --> 01:05:54.621
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi ?

01:05:54.705 --> 01:05:58.167
Yes.
He does ? You'resure ?

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.169
I checked it out.
It's clean.

01:06:04.298 --> 01:06:07.718
Now, where were you ?

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.887
Where was Marcus ?

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:12.139
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:14.349
Who was he with ?
He was...

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.894
at Atlantis... with...

01:06:16.977 --> 01:06:21.023
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.650
and... you.

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:29.781
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:34.036
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:36.288
but he had made plans.

01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:40.334
And I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.

01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:42.794
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:47.758
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go
to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:52.054
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn
up sooner or later. I mean, to think...

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:57.392
that one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

01:06:57.434 --> 01:06:59.728
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

01:07:20.582 --> 01:07:23.043
Christie. Christie.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:26.880
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:29.716
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.594
I don't think so.

01:07:32.636 --> 01:07:35.931
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:37.933
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:59.163
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:01.165
All right.

01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:04.543
So, you're looking great.
How have you been ?

01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:08.463
Well, I actually might need surgery
after last time. Really ?

01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:12.634
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:15.387
Lawyers are so complicated.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:18.015
Don't do that.

01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:20.017
Here's a check.

01:09:07.773 --> 01:09:11.609
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:20.368
Okay, your name is Christie.

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:23.080
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:27.584
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:31.087
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:40.805
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton ?

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:45.935
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ?
With Spicey ?

01:09:46.019 --> 01:09:49.231
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but
definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:51.441
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:56.697
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.324
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

01:10:01.493 --> 01:10:03.620
Oh, it's not
that nice.

01:10:08.292 --> 01:10:11.962
Where did you two meet ?
Oh, God. We met at...

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:16.466
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:19.845
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.

01:10:19.928 --> 01:10:22.181
What do you mean ?
She was a hot number.

01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:26.852
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you
a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.

01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:29.480
What do you do ?

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:33.484
She's my... cousin.

01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:37.488
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:40.908
Where's your phone ?
I've gotta call Harley.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:48.081
Where do you summer,
South Hampton ?

01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:52.419
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:56.507
It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn
drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:58.675
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I ?

01:10:58.759 --> 01:11:00.677
This tastes weird.

01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:05.015
Harley, it's me. I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.

01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:08.852
- I'm at--
- Paul Allen's.

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:11.230
Who ?
Paul Allen's.

01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:15.234
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at
Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.

01:11:15.317 --> 01:11:19.071
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:21.073
Did you know that guy
who disappeared ?

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:24.034
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ?
Was he a friend of yours ?

01:11:24.117 --> 01:11:26.036
No.

01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:28.997
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:32.084
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

01:11:33.794 --> 01:11:35.921
I would just like to see...

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.507
the two of you...
get it on.

01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:41.760
What's wrong with that ?

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.096
It's totally disease free.

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:49.017
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:51.395
Don't you find Christie
attractive ?

01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:55.232
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

01:11:55.274 --> 01:11:57.609
Come on.

01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:01.113
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time ?

01:12:03.907 --> 01:12:06.577
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:10.497
Are you telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?

01:12:10.581 --> 01:12:13.709
No. I'm not a lesbian.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.628
Why would you think
I would be into that ?

01:12:16.712 --> 01:12:18.881
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

01:12:18.964 --> 01:12:23.552
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.100
Did you know...

01:12:30.184 --> 01:12:33.645
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:36.732
called simply
Whitney Houston...

01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:39.610
had four number-one
singles on it ?

01:12:41.069 --> 01:12:43.197
Did you know that,
Christie ?

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.700
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston ?

01:12:46.783 --> 01:12:49.578
You own
a Whitney Houston CD ?

01:12:50.913 --> 01:12:54.166
More than one ?

01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:57.711
It's hard to choose a favorite among
so many great tracks.

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:04.593
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best, most powerful songs...

01:13:04.635 --> 01:13:06.804
ever written...

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.806
about self-preservation...

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:11.099
and dignity.

01:13:11.141 --> 01:13:14.770
It's universal message
crosses all boundaries...

01:13:14.812 --> 01:13:17.022
and instills one...

01:13:17.105 --> 01:13:20.734
with the hope
that it's not too late...

01:13:20.818 --> 01:13:23.153
to better ourselves.

01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:26.573
Since, Elizabeth,

01:13:26.657 --> 01:13:31.620
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,

01:13:31.662 --> 01:13:35.249
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

01:13:35.332 --> 01:13:39.628
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:45.425
And it's beautifully stated
on the album.

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:57.748
- Not the face !

01:14:57.831 --> 01:15:01.877
You bitch, not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash !

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:33.177
I want a firm commitment.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:36.889
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

01:16:36.972 --> 01:16:38.891
Why ? What's wrong ?

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:44.396
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.274
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

01:16:47.357 --> 01:16:50.360
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:54.781
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick ?

01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:56.867
It's over, Evelyn.

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.453
It's all over.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:02.831
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

01:17:02.873 --> 01:17:06.376
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:11.298
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:14.259
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:19.598
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:22.976
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something--

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:28.398
I know that your friends are my friends,
and, uh-- and I've thought about that.

01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:31.527
You can have 'em.

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:35.072
You're really serious,
aren't you ? Yes, lam.

01:17:38.242 --> 01:17:42.412
- What about the past ? Our past ?
- We never really shared one.

01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:44.540
You're inhuman.
No.

01:17:44.623 --> 01:17:47.751
I'm in touch with humanity.

01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:52.256
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh--

01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:54.383
You're not terribly
important to me.

01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:57.136
Oh, no !

01:17:57.219 --> 01:17:59.471
No. No, Patrick.

01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:04.101
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

01:18:05.477 --> 01:18:08.564
What do you want me to do ?
What is it that you want ?

01:18:08.647 --> 01:18:11.984
If you really wanna do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:14.987
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.573
I'm leaving. I've assessed the
situation, and I'm going.

01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:20.951
Where are you going ?
I'm just leaving.

01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:23.162
But where ?

01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.498
I have to return
some videotapes.

01:18:57.321 --> 01:18:59.156
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:17.591
Oh, my God.
What are you doing ?

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:19.676
Stop that.

01:20:01.426 --> 01:20:03.846
Drop the weapon !
Drop it now !

01:20:03.887 --> 01:20:05.931
Get on the ground!
Put your--

01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:51.477
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith ?

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.937
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:26.155
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:29.241
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know I've killed a lot of people.

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:32.119
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

01:22:32.202 --> 01:22:35.414
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:37.875
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:40.210
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:43.463
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

01:22:43.547 --> 01:22:48.010
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot with a dog.

01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:50.262
Last week, I, uh--

01:22:50.345 --> 01:22:53.849
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

01:22:56.643 --> 01:22:59.897
I had to.
She almost got away.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.899
And--

01:23:01.982 --> 01:23:07.112
Someone else there. I can't remember,
maybe a model-- She's dead too.

01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:09.740
And, uh, Paul Allen.

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:13.660
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

01:23:13.744 --> 01:23:18.165
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:22.878
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe... 20 people.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.048
Maybe 40 !

01:23:26.089 --> 01:23:29.468
I have tapes of a lot of it.

01:23:29.551 --> 01:23:32.179
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

01:23:32.262 --> 01:23:34.932
I even, um,

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.483
I ate some
of their brains...

01:23:44.566 --> 01:23:48.320
and I tried to
cook a little.

01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:53.909
Tonight, I, uh--

01:23:53.992 --> 01:23:57.955
I just had to kill
a lot of people !

01:23:57.996 --> 01:24:00.165
And, um,

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:08.340
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:14.221
So, uh-- I mean,

01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:17.766
I guess...

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:20.477
I'm a pretty, uh--

01:24:21.562 --> 01:24:24.565
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

01:24:24.648 --> 01:24:27.234
So,

01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:31.738
if you get back tomorrow,

01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:34.074
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

01:24:34.158 --> 01:24:37.244
So, you know,

01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:39.538
keep your eyes open.

01:24:39.621 --> 01:24:42.708
Okay.

01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:48.672
Oh !

01:26:58.927 --> 01:27:01.263
Are you my 2:00 ?

01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:05.267
No.
Can I help you ?

01:27:06.435 --> 01:27:10.522
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

01:27:11.648 --> 01:27:15.444
Doesn't he... live here ?
No, he doesn't.

01:27:15.527 --> 01:27:18.447
You sure ?

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:20.866
You saw the ad
in the Times ?

01:27:20.949 --> 01:27:23.911
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

01:27:23.952 --> 01:27:27.539
ln the Times. There was no ad
in the Times.

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.084
I think you should
go now.

01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:33.086
But I think--

01:27:34.713 --> 01:27:36.924
I wanna know
what happened here.

01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:40.260
Don't make any trouble,
please.

01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:42.596
I suggest you go.

01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:56.318
Don't come back.

01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:58.570
I won't.

01:27:58.654 --> 01:28:00.739
Don't worry.

01:28:27.766 --> 01:28:31.937
Patrick Bateman's office.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.732
Jean ? I need help.
Patrick, is that you ?

01:28:36.775 --> 01:28:39.361
Jean, I'm not--

01:28:39.444 --> 01:28:43.949
Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you,
David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

01:28:44.032 --> 01:28:47.911
Oh, God. What did you say,
you dumb bitch ?

01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:51.874
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing ?

01:28:51.957 --> 01:28:53.917
Where are you, Patrick ?
What's wrong ?

01:28:56.044 --> 01:29:00.757
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean,
to the, uh,

01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:02.759
office this afternoon.

01:29:02.843 --> 01:29:04.761
Why ?

01:29:04.845 --> 01:29:09.558
Just say no ! What is it, Patrick ?
Are you all right ?

01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:13.812
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.814
Jesus !

01:30:33.058 --> 01:30:37.479
That's a table for three. Bateman,
you're looking wild-eyed. Rough day ?

01:30:37.563 --> 01:30:40.482
Hey, look. Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

01:30:40.566 --> 01:30:43.652
He's a changed man, except for he still
can't a reservation to save his life.

01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:45.904
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

01:30:45.988 --> 01:30:49.491
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

01:30:49.575 --> 01:30:53.370
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots. Let's get a "res."

01:30:53.453 --> 01:30:57.207
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:59.293
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

01:30:59.376 --> 01:31:01.920
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

01:31:02.004 --> 01:31:04.423
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

01:31:04.506 --> 01:31:07.843
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone.
I'll do it. I'll call you back.

01:31:07.885 --> 01:31:11.305
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

01:31:11.346 --> 01:31:14.349
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

01:31:15.809 --> 01:31:19.480
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message ?

01:31:19.563 --> 01:31:23.775
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it ?

01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:27.613
Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

01:31:27.696 --> 01:31:29.615
That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean ?

01:31:29.698 --> 01:31:34.119
The message you left. By the way, Davis,
how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?

01:31:34.203 --> 01:31:36.288
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean ?

01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:39.958
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:42.586
Is that Edward Towers ?

01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:44.588
Carnes, wait. Uh--

01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:50.427
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

01:31:50.511 --> 01:31:54.431
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

01:31:54.515 --> 01:31:56.600
Bateman is such a dork.

01:31:56.683 --> 01:32:00.312
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

01:32:00.395 --> 01:32:04.233
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:06.902
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

01:32:06.985 --> 01:32:10.489
Wait. Uh-- Stop.

01:32:11.782 --> 01:32:14.368
I did it, Carnes.

01:32:14.451 --> 01:32:16.411
I killed him.

01:32:16.453 --> 01:32:19.039
I'm Patrick Bateman.

01:32:22.251 --> 01:32:24.503
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

01:32:25.754 --> 01:32:30.759
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

01:32:30.843 --> 01:32:33.679
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

01:32:33.762 --> 01:32:36.932
No. No, listen.

01:32:37.015 --> 01:32:39.518
Don't you know who I am ?

01:32:39.601 --> 01:32:42.354
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

01:32:45.065 --> 01:32:48.318
We talk on the phone
all the time.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.988
Don't you recognize me ?

01:32:52.364 --> 01:32:55.200
You're my lawyer.

01:32:55.284 --> 01:32:59.872
Now, Carnes, listen.

01:32:59.955 --> 01:33:02.207
Listen very, very carefully.

01:33:05.919 --> 01:33:09.256
I killed Paul Allen,

01:33:09.339 --> 01:33:11.341
and I liked it.

01:33:11.383 --> 01:33:15.220
I can't make myself
any clearer.

01:33:15.262 --> 01:33:19.391
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.

01:33:19.475 --> 01:33:23.020
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible ?

01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:27.357
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard ?

01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:29.693
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

01:33:29.735 --> 01:33:32.321
twice in London
just ten days ago.

01:33:32.404 --> 01:33:34.490
No, you...

01:33:37.242 --> 01:33:40.078
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:34:21.286 --> 01:34:23.622
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

01:34:23.664 --> 01:34:27.209
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

01:34:27.292 --> 01:34:31.755
We need to find a way to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

01:34:31.797 --> 01:34:34.216
can't be run
by committee.

01:34:34.299 --> 01:34:36.760
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

01:34:36.844 --> 01:34:40.764
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

01:34:40.806 --> 01:34:44.768
And in the end, this maybe the eventual
blessing in disguise...

01:34:44.852 --> 01:34:46.854
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

01:34:46.937 --> 01:34:50.566
How can he lie like that ?

01:34:50.649 --> 01:34:52.609
How can he pull that shit ?
What shit ?

01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:54.778
Now, where do we have
reservations at ?

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.823
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

01:34:57.906 --> 01:35:00.826
How can you be so fucking,

01:35:00.909 --> 01:35:03.412
I don't know,
cool about it ?

01:35:03.495 --> 01:35:06.957
Some guys arejust
born cool, I guess.

01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:13.839
Bateman ?

01:35:13.922 --> 01:35:19.178
- What are you so fucking zany about ?
- I'm just a happy camper.

01:35:19.261 --> 01:35:21.722
Rockin' and a rollin' !

01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:23.849
Oh, brother, look.

01:35:23.932 --> 01:35:28.979
He presents himself as this harmless
old codger, but inside--

01:35:29.021 --> 01:35:31.648
but inside--

01:35:31.732 --> 01:35:34.651
But inside doesn't matter.

01:35:34.693 --> 01:35:39.031
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.

01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:41.700
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think ?

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:48.916
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?

01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:51.001
I need a scotch.

01:36:07.184 --> 01:36:10.229
There are no more barriers
to cross.

01:36:10.312 --> 01:36:14.149
All I have in common with the
uncontrollable and the insane,

01:36:14.233 --> 01:36:17.569
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

01:36:17.611 --> 01:36:19.696
and my utter indifference
toward it,

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.366
I have now surpassed.

01:36:25.035 --> 01:36:27.955
My pain is constant and sharp...

01:36:28.038 --> 01:36:31.667
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:36.255
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

01:36:36.338 --> 01:36:38.924
I want no one to escape.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.928
But even after admitting this,

01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:45.180
there is no catharsis.

01:36:45.264 --> 01:36:48.016
My punishment continues
to elude me...

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.311
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

01:36:51.395 --> 01:36:55.149
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

01:36:55.232 --> 01:36:59.403
This confession
has meant... nothing.

01:38:18.398 --> 01:38:21.068
Word.

01:39:15.164 --> 01:39:18.083
Come on.
