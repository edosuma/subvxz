WEBVTT

00:03.199 --> 00:05.994
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

00:06.161 --> 00:09.414
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm...

00:09.581 --> 00:11.749
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

00:12.834 --> 00:16.129
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

00:16.296 --> 00:17.922
I could fall asleep at a play.

00:19.090 --> 00:21.134
- What is it?
- It's a one-woman play called:

00:21.301 --> 00:24.304
Why Don '2' You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.

00:24.471 --> 00:25.513
Ooh.

00:26.014 --> 00:28.683
- That sounds interesting.
- That does sound interesting.

00:28.850 --> 00:32.145
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet...

00:34.981 --> 00:38.318
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

00:38.485 --> 00:40.987
What more do these broads want?

00:41.821 --> 00:44.324
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

00:44.491 --> 00:46.242
What? How come you don't have to go?

00:46.409 --> 00:47.994
I wish I could, but I found out...

00:48.161 --> 00:51.664
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

00:51.831 --> 00:54.459
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.545
Ooh. Let's see. Who do I hate?

00:59.797 --> 01:01.174
Oh, sorry.

01:01.508 --> 01:02.967
- Oops, sorry.
- Okay.

01:03.134 --> 01:04.718
- Okay.
- Okay. Up you 90-

01:04.885 --> 01:07.096
- Oh, gosh, okay!
- All right.

01:16.731 --> 01:19.734
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

01:19.901 --> 01:23.279
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

01:23.446 --> 01:26.658
...and not have it be a big deal?

01:28.076 --> 01:30.578
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

01:31.621 --> 01:33.248
- No reason.
- No, no. Rachel?

01:33.414 --> 01:35.416
- Yeah.
- Who do you want to fool around with?

01:35.667 --> 01:38.044
Nobody! Forget it.

01:38.294 --> 01:39.337
Joey?

01:40.255 --> 01:41.881
Maybe.

01:43.049 --> 01:44.551
- You can't.
- Why?

01:44.717 --> 01:45.927
Because.

01:49.430 --> 01:52.892
Okay, seriously,
did not understand a word you just said.

01:53.935 --> 01:56.187
- In the hall.
- Okay.

01:58.856 --> 02:00.733
- You wanna fool around with Joey?
- Yeah.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.445
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

02:04.612 --> 02:07.240
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

02:07.407 --> 02:10.076
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

02:10.243 --> 02:14.497
Okay. Off the top of my head...
Don and Janet.

02:14.664 --> 02:17.333
- Who are they?
- I know them from work.

02:18.001 --> 02:20.295
- Both of them?
- No, just one of them.

02:20.461 --> 02:22.255
Which one?

02:22.672 --> 02:25.341
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

02:25.508 --> 02:28.303
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

02:28.469 --> 02:31.931
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it...

02:32.098 --> 02:36.936
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

02:38.438 --> 02:40.106
What the hell are you cooking?

03:33.034 --> 03:34.160
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:34.327 --> 03:37.205
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

03:37.372 --> 03:41.918
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

03:43.002 --> 03:46.506
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

03:47.215 --> 03:50.718
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

03:50.885 --> 03:52.011
What's bad about that?

03:52.178 --> 03:54.889
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

03:55.056 --> 03:58.601
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

03:59.602 --> 04:00.687
Ross?

04:00.853 --> 04:03.523
What? These aren't suede.

04:07.151 --> 04:10.196
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

04:10.363 --> 04:13.408
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

04:13.574 --> 04:14.617
No.

04:18.245 --> 04:21.457
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

04:21.624 --> 04:25.128
- Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.
- Oh.

04:25.586 --> 04:28.840
Oh, that's... That's...
That's nice.

04:29.507 --> 04:30.842
It's good to meet you.

04:31.008 --> 04:33.886
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

04:34.053 --> 04:35.888
No, it's no big deal.

04:36.055 --> 04:40.393
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

04:41.477 --> 04:42.729
Is he gonna introduce us?

04:42.895 --> 04:46.232
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

04:47.150 --> 04:49.402
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

04:49.569 --> 04:53.030
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

04:53.197 --> 04:57.160
I wrote that in one night.

04:58.870 --> 05:01.414
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

05:02.415 --> 05:04.709
Well, we should probably get going.

05:05.626 --> 05:07.670
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

05:07.837 --> 05:10.548
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

05:11.340 --> 05:13.426
I don't think so.

05:13.801 --> 05:16.429
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

05:16.596 --> 05:19.682
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

05:19.849 --> 05:23.811
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

05:23.978 --> 05:27.148
An option that many of my students use.

05:28.024 --> 05:30.109
- Shall we?
- We shouldn't wait for him?

05:30.276 --> 05:33.529
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

05:33.696 --> 05:36.073
- Professor Geller?
- Oh, damn it!

05:46.751 --> 05:49.462
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

05:49.629 --> 05:54.258
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

05:55.676 --> 05:57.553
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:57.720 --> 05:58.888
What's happening?

05:59.138 --> 06:03.351
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

06:03.518 --> 06:06.562
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

06:06.729 --> 06:10.441
- You know me, work comes first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:11.943 --> 06:15.488
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

06:17.281 --> 06:19.575
Stupid Jan Rogers!

06:20.576 --> 06:22.578
You are having a party tonight?

06:23.120 --> 06:26.290
I'm kind of having a thing
for the Days of our Lives people.

06:26.457 --> 06:27.834
You weren't gonna tell us?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.419
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

06:30.586 --> 06:32.421
I do it every year.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.092
You do that every year?!

06:36.259 --> 06:38.427
I didn't have to tell you that!

06:38.761 --> 06:41.472
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

06:42.473 --> 06:45.685
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

06:45.852 --> 06:46.936
Yeah.

06:47.103 --> 06:50.565
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

06:50.731 --> 06:51.941
Yeah.

06:52.817 --> 06:57.446
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

06:57.613 --> 06:59.782
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

06:59.949 --> 07:03.160
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

07:03.411 --> 07:07.665
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

07:07.832 --> 07:10.710
Well, then, so just invite me.

07:11.294 --> 07:14.547
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

07:14.714 --> 07:18.718
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

07:18.885 --> 07:22.388
- I will behave. Please, please, please.
- Okay, fine. You can come.

07:22.555 --> 07:26.183
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

07:26.434 --> 07:27.935
A soap-opera roof party?!

07:28.102 --> 07:31.772
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Uh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:34.442 --> 07:36.527
And it's out of my system.

07:42.158 --> 07:47.747
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the GalÃ©pagos.

07:47.914 --> 07:52.126
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

07:52.501 --> 07:57.423
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

07:57.590 --> 07:59.884
...and cracked crab...

08:00.051 --> 08:02.219
...and snow crab...

08:02.386 --> 08:04.889
...and king crab.

08:05.056 --> 08:08.184
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

08:09.769 --> 08:12.688
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

08:12.855 --> 08:16.609
- And that's not all I'm allergic to.
- Oh, it's not over.

08:16.776 --> 08:20.905
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

08:21.072 --> 08:23.240
...and almonds and filberts...

08:23.407 --> 08:25.076
So basically all nuts!

08:25.368 --> 08:27.495
Interestingly, no.

08:28.329 --> 08:32.166
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

08:33.876 --> 08:37.546
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

08:38.756 --> 08:40.383
Oh, my God!

08:40.549 --> 08:42.717
I've lost the will to live.

08:44.428 --> 08:45.930
- Let's ditch him.
- What?

08:46.097 --> 08:48.808
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

08:48.975 --> 08:52.770
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

08:52.937 --> 08:56.023
When we exit, should we walk or run...

08:56.190 --> 08:58.567
...or prance or stroll...?

08:58.734 --> 09:03.572
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

09:13.290 --> 09:15.543
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

09:15.793 --> 09:18.629
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

09:18.796 --> 09:21.966
- Hi.
- Charlie will be joining my department.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.301
- You're a paleontologist too?
- Yeah.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.679
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

09:26.846 --> 09:31.183
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

09:33.060 --> 09:36.397
I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

09:38.524 --> 09:41.402
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

09:41.694 --> 09:44.280
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

09:44.447 --> 09:49.618
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

09:51.787 --> 09:53.456
So did you two have fun?

09:53.622 --> 09:56.083
Oh, my God. She's great.

09:56.250 --> 10:00.546
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

10:00.713 --> 10:04.425
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

10:04.759 --> 10:05.801
Hi!

10:10.514 --> 10:11.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:11.932 --> 10:15.728
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

10:15.895 --> 10:19.315
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

10:19.482 --> 10:20.816
Really? What's wrong?

10:20.983 --> 10:23.194
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.822
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

10:26.989 --> 10:31.243
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

10:31.619 --> 10:34.121
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

10:34.288 --> 10:37.041
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

10:39.210 --> 10:40.961
Okay, who's this?

10:41.504 --> 10:44.840
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

10:45.007 --> 10:46.926
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

10:47.093 --> 10:50.387
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

10:50.930 --> 10:54.141
- Rachel, can I see you for a second?
- Sure.

10:59.355 --> 11:00.606
You're not sick.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.733
What? Yes, I am!

11:02.900 --> 11:05.361
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

11:07.488 --> 11:11.408
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

11:12.993 --> 11:16.288
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

11:16.455 --> 11:19.250
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.669
Okay, then what is this?

11:22.336 --> 11:23.379
Okay.

11:24.463 --> 11:27.633
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.344
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.513
What?!

11:33.347 --> 11:34.598
What? What's going on?

11:34.765 --> 11:38.394
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof!

11:38.561 --> 11:42.982
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

11:43.566 --> 11:47.111
- You came to say you were sick.
- All right, professor or detective?

11:48.195 --> 11:51.824
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

11:51.991 --> 11:55.578
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

11:55.744 --> 11:59.957
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

12:00.124 --> 12:02.376
And that horrible museum tour?

12:02.710 --> 12:04.503
No, I arranged that.

12:08.507 --> 12:11.302
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

12:14.722 --> 12:16.432
We know about your party, Joey.

12:16.599 --> 12:20.102
- What party?
- The game's over. Take off your robe.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.063
Okay, I mean...

12:23.689 --> 12:25.441
No!

12:25.608 --> 12:28.986
Close it up! Close it up!

12:30.988 --> 12:32.323
Nice to meet you.

12:42.374 --> 12:44.293
Hey, you made it! All right!

12:44.460 --> 12:46.670
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

12:47.046 --> 12:50.007
- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
- Hi.

12:50.674 --> 12:52.426
I love you!

12:52.593 --> 12:56.263
Hey. That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

12:56.430 --> 12:58.432
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

12:58.599 --> 13:01.477
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

13:01.685 --> 13:02.728
Hey.

13:02.895 --> 13:05.314
My God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

13:05.481 --> 13:07.024
I can barely control myself.

13:07.191 --> 13:09.818
You might want to remember
that you're married.

13:09.985 --> 13:12.238
Where is Chandler anyway?

13:12.404 --> 13:13.989
Oh, my God! Chandler!

13:20.579 --> 13:23.332
Where the hell is everybody?

13:25.501 --> 13:28.170
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

13:32.132 --> 13:35.386
Chapter 1: My First Period.

13:39.974 --> 13:42.059
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

13:42.226 --> 13:44.353
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

13:44.520 --> 13:48.649
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

13:49.400 --> 13:53.862
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

13:54.029 --> 13:56.824
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

13:56.991 --> 13:58.867
...I never would've gotten married!

14:00.035 --> 14:02.121
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:02.288 --> 14:04.373
- Call me.
- We will!

14:06.166 --> 14:09.169
- Look at you with all the guys!
- Yeah.

14:09.336 --> 14:10.713
I guess you've forgotten Joey.

14:10.879 --> 14:13.674
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
aboutJoey.

14:13.841 --> 14:16.218
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

14:17.219 --> 14:19.346
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

14:19.513 --> 14:21.598
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

14:24.601 --> 14:28.564
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

14:28.731 --> 14:32.609
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

14:32.776 --> 14:35.029
Oh, so sad.

14:35.571 --> 14:38.282
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

14:38.449 --> 14:42.536
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

14:42.953 --> 14:45.748
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

14:45.914 --> 14:49.043
- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
- Yeah.

14:49.209 --> 14:52.129
And you called him "Albie"?

14:52.963 --> 14:57.176
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein...

14:57.968 --> 14:59.011
Albie.

15:00.846 --> 15:03.057
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

15:03.223 --> 15:05.392
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

15:05.559 --> 15:09.021
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

15:09.188 --> 15:13.525
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

15:13.692 --> 15:15.361
...he had a lot of issues.

15:15.527 --> 15:17.404
Oh, like what?

15:17.780 --> 15:20.949
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

15:21.116 --> 15:25.287
...what regular people experience
when they watch Access Hollywood.

15:25.746 --> 15:27.498
Okay, you want the dirt?

15:27.664 --> 15:29.792
Albie was seriously insecure.

15:29.958 --> 15:33.170
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

15:33.337 --> 15:36.757
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

15:36.924 --> 15:38.926
A guy who won two.

15:39.468 --> 15:40.761
Two? What...?

15:40.928 --> 15:43.889
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

15:44.056 --> 15:45.933
Yeah, for three years.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.476
Oh, my God.

15:48.352 --> 15:52.648
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

15:54.149 --> 15:55.776
No.

15:56.568 --> 15:58.695
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

15:58.862 --> 16:01.198
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

16:01.365 --> 16:04.660
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

16:05.160 --> 16:07.663
What a loser.

16:09.248 --> 16:11.125
Some more wine?

16:15.295 --> 16:17.714
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

16:17.881 --> 16:19.758
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

16:19.925 --> 16:23.846
...I'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

16:24.304 --> 16:25.597
What's the matter?

16:25.764 --> 16:30.394
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

16:30.561 --> 16:33.355
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

16:33.522 --> 16:37.860
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.279
I always loved that.

16:40.446 --> 16:43.949
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

16:45.409 --> 16:48.120
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

16:48.287 --> 16:50.831
They're so out of my league.

16:51.331 --> 16:52.458
Oh, my God!

16:52.624 --> 16:54.585
- Worse?
- Oh, much, much worse.

16:54.751 --> 16:58.922
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.215
"Can we walk?"

17:02.426 --> 17:04.720
- Oh, you like that?
- No.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.137
What?

17:06.305 --> 17:09.641
Come on! I think that's funny!

17:10.309 --> 17:11.935
Woolly mammoth.

17:12.102 --> 17:13.811
L'I'S good!

17:15.939 --> 17:20.109
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

17:20.277 --> 17:22.905
Oh, yes. God, yes.

17:23.489 --> 17:25.406
Well, you're not gonna get one!

17:25.574 --> 17:28.994
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

17:30.245 --> 17:34.041
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

17:35.876 --> 17:38.337
How could he leave me?!

17:40.088 --> 17:42.758
I don't know. You seem lovely.

17:49.723 --> 17:53.977
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

17:54.144 --> 17:56.563
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what show are you on?

17:56.730 --> 18:00.108
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

18:00.943 --> 18:02.694
- That's science.
- Oh.

18:03.237 --> 18:05.989
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on Days.

18:06.156 --> 18:09.034
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

18:10.953 --> 18:15.874
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.293
Oh. Well, no, but...

18:18.460 --> 18:22.381
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

18:22.548 --> 18:25.676
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

18:27.386 --> 18:28.971
I'd lead with that.

18:31.265 --> 18:34.059
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

18:34.935 --> 18:35.978
Monica!

18:36.478 --> 18:39.690
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

18:43.735 --> 18:44.987
What the...?

18:45.153 --> 18:46.446
What do you got there?

18:46.613 --> 18:49.116
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

18:49.283 --> 18:51.535
- Oh, really? Let me see.
- Oh.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.746
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

18:54.913 --> 18:57.207
Are you a little slutty?

18:58.959 --> 19:01.169
I think I am.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.381
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

19:04.548 --> 19:06.800
- This guy wears a rug.
- Well...

19:06.967 --> 19:09.386
This guy's Canadian.

19:09.886 --> 19:12.472
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

19:12.639 --> 19:17.394
It'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

19:18.979 --> 19:21.064
Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.

19:21.231 --> 19:24.443
- Why? What's wrong with these guys?
- Well, nothing major.

19:24.610 --> 19:28.030
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

19:28.196 --> 19:30.407
...and you deserve the best.

19:30.574 --> 19:32.826
Joey, you're so sweet.

19:32.993 --> 19:37.372
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

19:37.539 --> 19:39.249
Who?

19:42.794 --> 19:44.129
Me.

19:44.338 --> 19:45.922
What?

19:46.506 --> 19:48.258
Really?

19:48.592 --> 19:51.762
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

19:51.928 --> 19:54.222
Right! That's funny! I get it!

19:54.389 --> 19:57.309
- Got you!
- You're funny, Joey.

19:57.809 --> 19:59.561
Oh, my God.

20:05.609 --> 20:08.362
So how did you enjoy the play?

20:08.862 --> 20:13.742
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

20:13.909 --> 20:14.951
You should be.

20:15.118 --> 20:19.331
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

20:19.498 --> 20:22.668
- You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

20:22.834 --> 20:27.047
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

20:30.008 --> 20:35.180
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

20:36.056 --> 20:38.183
...I was uplifted.

20:39.267 --> 20:40.352
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

20:40.519 --> 20:43.772
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

20:44.189 --> 20:47.901
Tell me...
Tell me about your first period.

20:49.653 --> 20:50.904
No!

20:52.656 --> 20:54.282
Did somebody sign your bra?

20:54.449 --> 20:58.453
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

20:59.663 --> 21:04.334
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

21:04.501 --> 21:08.171
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

21:08.338 --> 21:10.674
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

21:10.841 --> 21:12.926
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

21:13.301 --> 21:15.262
Go, Charlie!

21:15.804 --> 21:18.181
But my point is...

21:18.348 --> 21:22.269
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

21:22.436 --> 21:28.024
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

21:29.359 --> 21:33.989
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

21:34.156 --> 21:35.615
I mean...

21:35.782 --> 21:38.702
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

21:38.869 --> 21:44.708
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

21:46.543 --> 21:51.590
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

21:51.882 --> 21:53.258
And sexy.

21:53.425 --> 21:56.553
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.889
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

21:59.055 --> 22:01.600
- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
- Good for you.

22:01.767 --> 22:06.688
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

22:06.855 --> 22:08.857
Stop going through my stuff!

22:11.943 --> 22:13.195
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:13.361 --> 22:16.198
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

22:16.364 --> 22:18.408
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

22:18.575 --> 22:22.037
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

22:22.204 --> 22:24.247
Please! What about you and Chandler?

22:24.414 --> 22:27.375
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.878
Well, hello?

22:30.796 --> 22:34.257
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

22:34.424 --> 22:37.010
- Why don't you just kiss one of them.
- I could...

22:37.177 --> 22:40.722
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

22:41.389 --> 22:45.393
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

22:50.148 --> 22:51.274
I'm gonna do it.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.361
- And I can't stop you?
- No.

23:07.457 --> 23:10.710
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

23:16.466 --> 23:18.844
I'm smarter than him!

23:25.600 --> 23:28.478
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

23:28.645 --> 23:33.024
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

23:33.191 --> 23:34.985
You're so wonderful.

23:36.319 --> 23:38.405
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

23:39.865 --> 23:43.285
Chapter 1: My First Period.

23:45.287 --> 23:48.790
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
