00:35.520 --> 00:38.280
- She's still not here? 
 - Like you're surprised?

00:38.280 --> 00:39.920
She's always late.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.040
It's the makeup. 
 It's always the makeup.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.200
If she's not beautiful, 
 she stays home.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.960
She'll be here, 
 and she's got a great story.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.240
Yeah, well, we have rules, 
 and if she's always going to be--

00:51.240 --> 00:52.960
Whoa!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.560
Who are you?

01:00.560 --> 01:04.160
I've come to tell you a story.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
It's Kristen.

01:08.880 --> 01:13.760
- Excellent, Kris. 
 - It is time to begin my tale.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.280
- What's the getup? 
 - Sit down, you geek.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.160
- I'm doing this for effect. 
 - Sorry.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.680
My tale is one of woe.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.320
It has been told around 
 many campfires.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.800
I am here to tell 
 the one true version.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.240
First, I will need some help 
 with the Midnight Dust.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.000
I got it.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.680
Go for it.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.280
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.200
I call this story...

02:14.360 --> 02:16.840
[Kristen] 
 She stood over the grave

02:16.840 --> 02:18.960
holding a bouquet of wildflowers,

02:18.960 --> 02:22.040
as if taking a moment 
 for silent prayer.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.200
[faint eerie laughter]

02:59.120 --> 03:01.000
[man laughing]

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
[tweet tweet]

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
Aah!

03:35.320 --> 03:36.960
Whoa! Chill!

03:36.960 --> 03:38.840
We're not ghosts! 
 Relax!

03:38.840 --> 03:40.760
Then again, maybe we are.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.480
Ever see Night of the Living Dead? 
 Ha ha ha!

03:44.480 --> 03:45.960
Oh, back off, Jam.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.720
You guys always hang around 
 graveyards and scare people?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.920
Hey, we're just having a goof.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.040
I'm Greg. This is Jam. 
 We didn't mean to scare you.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.320
Sure we did, 
 but no harm done, right?

03:57.440 --> 04:00.240
- Uh, what's your name? 
 - Dede.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.680
What are you doing 
 here by yourself?

04:02.680 --> 04:07.800
- Bringing flowers to a grave. 
 - Or maybe looking for ghosts...

04:07.800 --> 04:10.000
like us. 
 What's the matter?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.200
Can't wait for Halloween?

04:13.520 --> 04:16.279
Forget Halloween, my dear.

04:16.279 --> 04:19.959
Saturday Night's Prom Night--

04:19.959 --> 04:21.880
The Night of the Prom Queen.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.960
Prom Queen?

04:23.960 --> 04:26.920
You don't know the story 
 of the Prom Queen?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.440
Uh, no. 
 Don't you live around here?

04:29.440 --> 04:30.960
I used to. 
 I'm just visiting.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.840
Oh, well, it's an old story. 
 They say that--

04:33.840 --> 04:37.120
Ho! Let me tell it. 
 I tell it best.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.680
It happened a long time ago...

04:44.960 --> 04:46.880
on prom night.

04:46.880 --> 04:52.480
A girl was waiting here by the 
 gates for her date to pick her up.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.720
She was all set to go,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.840
wearing her prom dress 
 and everything.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.800
But it was a foggy night-- 
 truly fog--

05:02.800 --> 05:06.800
the kind where you can't 
 see cars coming till it's too late.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.680
So there she was 
 waiting in the fog...

05:10.680 --> 05:14.480
when a car came ripping 
 around the corner.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.720
Some say that 
 the driver was bombed.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.400
As he took the turn too wide,

05:20.400 --> 05:25.320
he bounced over the curb, 
 and he hit her... smack!

05:27.040 --> 05:29.080
And the slime just drove off.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.560
Didn't even realize what he'd done.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.760
They found her the next morning.

05:37.760 --> 05:43.000
And a couple of days later, 
 they buried her...

05:43.000 --> 05:47.640
- in her prom dress. 
 - That's awful.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.720
- That's not the best part. 
 - It gets better?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.400
Oh, yeah.

05:52.400 --> 05:57.320
Every year on prom night, 
 the ghosts of the comes back.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.400
People have seen her 
 by the gates...

06:01.840 --> 06:05.680
Still waiting for the ride 
 that never comes.

06:05.680 --> 06:10.840
- And we're going to see it it's true. 
 - Really?

06:10.840 --> 06:14.240
We've been looking for a 
 grave that might be hers.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.120
Kind of juvenile, huh?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.680
I don't know. 
 Sounds kind of cool.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.880
You want to help? 
 It's a big cemetery.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.040
Come on. 
 Greg thinks you're a babe.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.400
Oh, what's wrong with you?

06:33.400 --> 06:36.840
Sure. Why not? 
 Sounds kind of creepy.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.440
Excellent.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.120
Let's go ghost hunting, 
 boys and ghouls.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.000
[laughter]

07:01.200 --> 07:03.320
So we didn't find her grave.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.720
- So what? 
 - Are you going to finish that?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.120
Uh-uh.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.160
All I'm saying is I want to find out 
 if there really was a car accident.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.960
This whole thing could be a waste.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.040
- Do you want the rest? 
 - Oh, I'm not hungry.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.680
Maybe we should go to the police.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.040
They got to keep 
 a record of accidents.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.560
Yeah, right. 
 Um, excuse me, Officer.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.120
We're going a little bit 
 of ghost hunting.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.960
Could we look through all your 
 files for the last hundred years?

07:29.960 --> 07:32.680
- Get real. 
 - Well, we could check newspapers.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.480
- Newspapers? 
 - Yeah.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.840
If it really happened, there 
 would have been an obituary

07:37.840 --> 07:39.760
or a story on the accident.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.080
Excellent. 
 Ha ha ha!

07:47.040 --> 07:49.760
[Kristen] 
 They went to the town library

07:49.760 --> 07:52.160
to scan old newspapers on microfilm.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.360
They started back in 1950 
 and worked forward,

07:56.360 --> 08:00.440
searching for any article on a 
 young girl in a fatal car accident...

08:00.440 --> 08:05.400
and they found it... in 1956.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.480
Hold it. Stop. 
 Read that.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.880
This is so neat. 
 I've never seen one of these.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.880
"Girl Killed by Hit and Run 
 on Prom Night."

08:18.880 --> 08:20.480
That's it.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.840
It happened just like you said-- 
 fog and all.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.600
I love it. 
 But what's it say?

08:31.600 --> 08:35.280
"Local Girl...

08:35.280 --> 08:40.320
Night of May 7, 1956..."

08:40.320 --> 08:43.280
Her name was Judy Larsen.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.040
It really happened. 
 Cool.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.800
So she was waiting for her boyfriend 
 Ricky Mitchell to pick her up,

08:54.800 --> 08:58.040
but Ricky's mother said 
 that he never got the message.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.120
Oh, no.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.400
"When Ricky heard 
 what happened,

09:01.400 --> 09:06.120
"he got so upset that he drove 
 his car, a 1955 Chevy,

09:06.120 --> 09:09.480
- off the Mianus River Bridge." 
 - He died too?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.960
They say it was an accident.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.520
And they never found him 
 or the car.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.480
Excellent.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.760
Two gruesome deaths 
 for the price of--

09:21.760 --> 09:24.680
- [rattling] 
 - What was that?

09:27.560 --> 09:30.320
Aw, you're just 
 getting spooked by--

09:30.320 --> 09:33.000
[rattling]

09:33.000 --> 09:35.040
Who's... that?

09:36.160 --> 09:39.760
Would you children 
 like some tea?

09:39.760 --> 09:40.760
Naw.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.880
Good comeback. 
 Naw.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.600
Man, you were scared to death. 
 Oh, like you weren't?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.960
- Hey, I was cool. 
 - Yeah, sure.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.800
If you guys get so scared 
 over an old lady,

09:54.800 --> 09:57.360
what's going to happen 
 when we see the ghost?

09:57.360 --> 10:00.720
- This is getting so old. 
 - No, it's not.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.400
It's just getting good. 
 I saw we help Judy.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.840
Help a ghost?

10:05.840 --> 10:07.880
Well, yeah. 
 According to legend,

10:07.880 --> 10:09.960
Judy's ghost shows 
 up every prom night

10:09.960 --> 10:11.840
waiting for a ride that 
 never comes, right?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.240
Yeah. So?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.880
So we just read that Ricky 
 never picked her up

10:15.880 --> 10:17.720
because he didn't know 
 he was supposed to.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.880
Judy, I'm here! 
 Where's little Ricky?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.320
- Shut up, Jam. 
 - What are you saying?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.520
I'm saying we try to 
 contact Ricky's spirit

10:25.520 --> 10:28.320
- and tell him to pick her up. 
 - Yeah, like a seance.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.360
Cool! This is 
 getting better all the time!

10:30.360 --> 10:32.400
Guys, you're goig 
 way too far on this.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
There's really no such 
 thing as ghosts.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.440
My parents go to 
 the movies on Fridays.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.880
We'll use my house.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.800
No. There's only 
 one place to have it.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.080
Where?

10:41.080 --> 10:44.160
Meet me back here tonight, 
 and I'll show you.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.800
Oh, a mystery.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.520
Who knows what will happen 
 when the lights go down?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.160
We'll be here, my dear.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.360
You don't really believe 
 all this stuff, do you?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.880
I don't know.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.240
It's kind of fun, though. 
 What do you say?

11:03.240 --> 11:05.920
I say that you're kind 
 of a strange person...

11:07.280 --> 11:10.600
- But I like that. 
 - Keen!

11:13.640 --> 11:15.600
Keen?

11:26.480 --> 11:29.880
- That's where Ricky went over. 
 - And they never found the car?

11:29.880 --> 11:33.280
- Yuck! 
 - Psych!

11:33.280 --> 11:35.920
Let's go to the Marina.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.400
Why can't we just 
 do this right here?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.680
Because this isn't 
 where it happened.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.280
[Greg] 
 Drop the anchor.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.840
Don't we need a medium 
 or something?

12:10.840 --> 12:13.600
No. I think we just 
 have to concentrate.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.960
Let's hold hands.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.800
I can't believe we're doing this. 
 Close your eyes.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.440
Clear your minds.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.960
Try to imagine Ricky.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.400
Think of his picture 
 in the newspaper.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.360
To contact Ricky's spirit, 
 we have to picture him.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.000
Think of what happened 
 that night.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.360
Try to picture an old '55 Chevy.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.400
See it driving onto the bridge.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.120
Ricky's behind the wheel, 
 and he's very upset because of Judy.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.480
- Hey, you're pretty good at this. 
 - Shh!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.360
Concentrate.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.440
Imagine Ricky driving.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.160
He's very upset. 
 He's driving too fast.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.320
He turns onto the bridge, but at 
 the last second, the car swerves.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.400
It's kids, and the Chevy Crashes 
 through the railing.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.960
It falls... and it falls...

13:13.960 --> 13:16.360
and it hits the river right here.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.040
Now picture the car sitting 
 on the bottom of the river

13:20.040 --> 13:22.480
filled with water 
 for years and years.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.280
Ricky's inside.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.360
[water bubbling]

13:27.360 --> 13:30.200
- What was that? 
 - Concentrate.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.480
Don't open your eyes.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.440
Keep picture the car 
 sitting there underwater--

13:36.440 --> 13:38.480
Ricky's grave.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.360
We're trying to contact 
 the spirit of Ricky Mitchell.

13:42.360 --> 13:46.840
Ricky Mitchell. 
 Do you hear us, Ricky?

13:46.840 --> 13:50.160
- [water bubbling] 
 - What was that?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.280
Bubbles from fish.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.720
Or a rusty chevy.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.360
If you can hear us, Ricky...

13:59.600 --> 14:02.880
We've got a message for you.

14:02.880 --> 14:08.320
On the night of the accident, 
 you were supposed to pick up Judy

14:08.320 --> 14:10.920
by the cemetery on 
 Weaver Street.

14:10.920 --> 14:15.640
She's still waiting for you. 
 She wants you to pick her up.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.800
This is stupid.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.040
Whoa!

14:23.680 --> 14:25.640
The anchor!

14:30.920 --> 14:33.400
I pulled it! 
 Go!

14:33.400 --> 14:35.080
It'll flip us!

14:47.000 --> 14:48.920
Here it comes! 
 Here it comes!

14:48.920 --> 14:50.680
Dig, Greg, dig!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.840
Dig, Greg, dig!

14:56.000 --> 15:00.400
Do it! Do it! 
 Dig, Greg, dig!

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
[coughing]

15:13.640 --> 15:15.520
Here it comes.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.920
- What happened? 
 - I don't know.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.760
Maybe he ran out of gas.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.960
That wasn't what 
 we thought it was, was it?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.440
No. It could have been 
 a leaky water main.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.440
It could have been 
 a sewage pipe.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.640
It could have been some kind 
 of natural gas pockets.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.200
- Or a ghost taking an evening spin. 
 - No!

15:40.200 --> 15:42.840
I don't know what it was, 
 but it was no ghost.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.920
- How do you know? 
 - Because there are no ghosts.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.520
Ghosts aren't real.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.840
Well, there's one way 
 to know for sure.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.280
- How? 
 - Tomorrow night.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.480
The graveyard. 
 Prom night.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.640
Be there if you dare.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.840
- Brave kids. 
 - Stupid, but brave.

16:17.840 --> 16:22.000
The next day, they checked 
 the cemetery records

16:22.000 --> 16:26.040
and found the name... 
 Judy...

16:26.040 --> 16:29.640
- Larsen. 
 - The grave they were looking for.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.640
Yes.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.280
The grave.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.840
There she is.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.480
Do we wait here or what?

16:44.480 --> 16:47.560
- Maybe we should split up. 
 - No way.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.920
We're staying together.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.640
Well, let wait down there.

16:51.640 --> 16:56.040
We can see the road to the gate 
 and the grave from there.

16:56.040 --> 16:56.800
OK.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.960
You don't really believe 
 all this stuff, do you?

17:09.960 --> 17:13.800
I mean, you're just doing 
 this for a goof, right?

17:13.800 --> 17:17.560
I don't know. 
 Let's see what happens.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.200
Does the legend say 
 when she's coming?

17:29.200 --> 17:34.080
- It's getting cold. 
 - Midnight. It's always midnight.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.440
Do you guys feel 
 as stupid as I do?

17:39.440 --> 17:42.600
- [jungling] 
 - Wait!

17:42.600 --> 17:45.400
Do you hear that?

17:45.400 --> 17:48.040
What's that?

17:48.040 --> 17:50.520
It's wild chimes.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.000
That could be anything.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.920
That could be the wind 
 through the trees.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.800
That could be something 
 on a grave.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.920
- That could be anything. 
 - Or the ghost.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.640
Look.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.840
No way.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.680
It's her. 
 Oh, man, it's her.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.520
Greg, don't. No way, man. 
 I'm not buying this.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.480
You're crazy. 
 Don't do it.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.440
I got to see.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.320
Boo!

18:43.520 --> 18:45.680
- Who are you? 
 - It was Jam's idea.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.560
- He made me do it. 
 - Jam?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.920
Ha ha ha! Caught you. 
 It was awesome!

18:49.920 --> 18:51.800
I thought you were 
 going to have a cow!

18:51.800 --> 18:53.400
I'm going to hurt you.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.280
Chuck, guys. 
 Guys, my cousin Chuck.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.080
- Hi. 
 - Check this. Pretty spooky, huh?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.560
Oh! Ghostly green! 
 Oh!

19:02.560 --> 19:04.000
[Greg] 
 You're a dead man.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Come on, guys. 
 It was just a goof.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.120
- There aren't any real ghosts. 
 - But last night...

19:10.120 --> 19:11.600
Give me a break.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.760
You really think there was 
 a ghost car driving underwater?

19:13.760 --> 19:14.960
Hello? 
 Anybody up there?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.520
You're losing teeth.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.160
Come on, Greg. 
 It was a goof.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.120
- Greg! 
 - What?

19:24.120 --> 19:25.370
Look!

19:32.640 --> 19:34.360
What's that?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.120
I don't know. I swear.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.560
Maybe he's got so crazy after all.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.480
It's a car.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.880
The caretaker. 
 Let's Jam.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.400
No. Listen.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.120
[fifties music playing]

19:59.440 --> 20:02.200
Greg, I swear. 
 I don't know who it is.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.960
It's an old chevy.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.720
[Dede] 
 # In the still #

20:12.720 --> 20:15.840
# Of the night #

20:15.840 --> 20:17.920
# I held you... #

20:17.920 --> 20:21.920
Dede? 
 What are you doing?

20:32.680 --> 20:36.680
I knew you'd be the ones 
 from the moment I saw you.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.040
You see, I couldn't 
 leave the cemetery

20:39.040 --> 20:41.000
unless someone 
 brought me with them.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And then you solved 
 the mystery

20:43.000 --> 20:47.440
of why Ricky never picked me up 
 and got him to come.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.880
I gotta go now. 
 My ride's finally here.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.920
- Dede? 
 - Oh, Dede's my nickname.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.880
My real name's Judy. 
 Thanks, guys.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.160
I'll never forget you.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.280
[In the Still of the Night playing]

21:32.280 --> 21:37.200
# Well before the light #

21:37.200 --> 21:39.600
# Hold me again #

21:39.600 --> 21:42.200
# With all of your might #

21:42.200 --> 21:45.160
# In the still of the night #

21:45.160 --> 21:49.080
# In the still of the night #

21:49.080 --> 21:51.080
# In the still #

21:51.080 --> 21:54.960
# Of the night #

21:54.960 --> 21:58.680
# Shoo doo shoo be doo... #

22:12.680 --> 22:14.760
The End.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.840
I declare this meeting of 
 the Midnight Society closed.

22:23.840 --> 22:28.560
Until next time, 
 pleasant dreams, everyone.

22:30.080 --> 22:30.800
