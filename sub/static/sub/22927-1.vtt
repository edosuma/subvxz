(Narrator)
<i>Nineteen days out of Yokohama,</i>

02:02.206 --> 02:06.252
<i>we were practically drifting toward Soipon
at six knots on hour.</i>

02:06.335 --> 02:09.295
<i>The convoy consisted
of five old Bonito vessels.</i>

02:09.380 --> 02:11.590
<i>Our engines were in poor shape.</i>

02:11.674 --> 02:15.386
<i>We carried badly needed supplies
toward the island outposts.</i>

02:15.469 --> 02:18.889
<i>We were fishermen,
proud to be drafted into service,</i>

02:18.973 --> 02:21.725
<i>and had two soldiers posted on each boat.</i>

02:21.809 --> 02:23.394
<i>No need for more, we thought.</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:26.647
<i>We were not prepared for defeat. Who is?</i>

02:28.107 --> 02:31.569
<i>The lead boat, the Hyosuke Mam,
was captained by an old salt</i>

02:31.652 --> 02:34.196
<i>who knew nothing about this watery arena.</i>

02:34.280 --> 02:37.283
<i>His maps showed some 2,000 islands,</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:40.077
<i>like sprinkled crumbs on a vast surface.</i>

02:40.161 --> 02:43.080
<i>We were now passing
the Mariana Archipelago.</i>

02:43.164 --> 02:45.166
<i>Once it had belonged to Spain,</i>

02:45.249 --> 02:47.960
<i>then to Germany, and finally to Japan,</i>

02:48.043 --> 02:49.962
<i>and we intended to keep it.</i>

02:50.045 --> 02:52.882
- This tropical <i>world</i> was a geological joke

02:52.965 --> 02:55.217
<i>of coral and volcano.</i>

02:55.301 --> 02:58.554
<i>Some islands lasted, some disappeared.</i>

02:58.637 --> 03:01.140
<i>Some were inhabited, others were not.</i>

03:01.223 --> 03:03.851
<i>Who'd want to live there anyway?</i>

03:03.934 --> 03:06.854
<i>This giant body of water
and all that was in it was ours.</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:09.982
<i>Our belief in victory was unshakable.</i>

03:10.065 --> 03:13.569
<i>We had stopped looking
at the steppingstones that paraded by.</i>

03:13.652 --> 03:15.196
<i>They were of no interest.</i>

03:15.279 --> 03:17.281
<i>We wanted to return home.</i>

03:22.912 --> 03:25.247
(Speaking Japanese)

03:26.498 --> 03:28.542
(Narrator)
<i>We now sighted Anatahan,</i>

03:28.626 --> 03:31.879
<i>a jungle rock that stood high
out of the sleeping waters.</i>

03:31.962 --> 03:34.089
<i>So it was duly recorded in the log,</i>

03:34.173 --> 03:37.885
<i>6:00 in the morning, June 12, 1944,</i>

03:37.968 --> 03:42.264
<i>the fourth year of a war to which
we had dedicated our lives like children,</i>

03:42.348 --> 03:45.517
<i>playing a game
without vision or foresight.</i>

03:45.601 --> 03:48.020

and bottle washer</i>

03:58.781 --> 04:02.034
<i>appeared promptly with asamestfl,
breakfast for the skipper.</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:09.041
<i>His American sailor's hat was a reminder
of a defeated enemy ship.</i>

(Man speaks Japanese)

04:14.713 --> 04:16.382

<i>The barren map of the world makes no note
of where misfortune strikes.</i>

04:52.835 --> 04:55.421
<i>We went down fast. Few survived.</i>

04:55.504 --> 04:58.590
<i>The Mariana Trench
over which we swam ashore</i>

04:58.674 --> 05:01.343
<i>was over 35,000 feet deep.</i>

05:01.427 --> 05:03.345
<i>The fiery centre of the earth</i>

05:03.429 --> 05:06.807
<i>had blown this rock of Anatahan
a long way from the ocean floor.</i>

05:06.890 --> 05:09.560
<i>How we got ashore, no one remembered.</i>

05:09.643 --> 05:13.647
<i>We were dumped like garbage
on a hot coast, left to rot.</i>

05:13.731 --> 05:17.651
<i>The change from a human being
with dignity to a helpless worm</i>

05:17.735 --> 05:19.445
<i>takes but a second.</i>

05:19.528 --> 05:24.033
<i>A merciful narcosis
kept us from suffering too much.</i>

05:26.201 --> 05:28.871
<i>One of the men
had not only saved his hide,</i>

05:28.954 --> 05:33.000
<i>but accomplished the heroic feat
of bringing a machine gun ashore.</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:35.836
<i>A warrant officer
with a long service record,</i>

05:35.919 --> 05:38.172
<i>he was the only one who knew what to do.</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:43.010
<i>To defend this island for a couple of months
was not a difficult task, he thought.</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:44.720
<i>He knew the enemy,</i>

05:44.803 --> 05:49.558
<i>and he knew the Imperial Navy would not
permit us to stay abandoned very long.</i>

05:53.520 --> 05:58.233
<i>Yes, we have picked the deepest part
of the Pacific Ocean,</i>

05:58.317 --> 06:00.694
<i>deep and solemn.</i>

06:01.820 --> 06:04.239
<i>And we were to be here
for seven long years.</i>

06:04.323 --> 06:08.118
<i>And little did we know that the enemy
was not in planes overhead,</i>

06:08.202 --> 06:13.207
<i>nor was it the lack of food,
the lack of water and medicine,</i>

06:13.290 --> 06:16.502
<i>nor the venomous plants that hemmed us in.</i>

06:16.585 --> 06:21.090
<i>How could we know that we had brought
the enemy with us in our own bodies,</i>

06:21.173 --> 06:24.176
<i>an enemy that would attack without notice?</i>

06:27.763 --> 06:30.766
(Speaking Japanese)

06:34.978 --> 06:37.898
<i>One of our men had spotted
a deserted village.</i>

06:37.981 --> 06:41.819
<i>This was good news
after many weeks of hardship.</i>

06:41.902 --> 06:45.906
(Japanese continues)

06:53.497 --> 06:58.210
<i>And so we entered
the twisting, haunted labyrinth</i>

06:58.293 --> 07:00.212
<i>of an unfamiliar jungle,</i>

07:00.295 --> 07:05.259
<i>a beautiful but vicious world
from which many of us never returned.</i>

08:05.569 --> 08:06.820
Oi!

08:07.779 --> 08:08.864
Oi!

08:10.449 --> 08:11.492
Oi!

08:12.784 --> 08:14.077
Oi!

08:37.808 --> 08:42.147
(Speaking Japanese)

08:46.318 --> 08:48.570
<i>What sort of a Japanese was this?</i>

08:48.654 --> 08:52.574
(Japanese continues)

08:52.658 --> 08:54.576
<i>His name was Kusakabe.</i>

08:54.660 --> 08:57.246
(Japanese continues)

08:57.329 --> 08:59.748
<i>Said he lived alone on the island.</i>

08:59.831 --> 09:03.126
<i>The others had left when the war started.</i>

09:04.002 --> 09:05.963
<i>He'd been plantation foreman,</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:08.048
<i>exported copra.</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:10.133
<i>But the jungle had taken over.</i>

09:11.552 --> 09:13.971
<i>An unfriendly man.</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:18.642
<i>Unfriendly to us,
and unfriendly to himself.</i>

09:20.477 --> 09:23.480
<i>Imagine living
on an island like this by choice,</i>

09:23.564 --> 09:25.857
<i>thousands of miles from nowhere.</i>

09:25.941 --> 09:27.985
(Speaking Japanese)

09:40.289 --> 09:43.417
<i>That's how we met Keiko.</i>

09:44.501 --> 09:46.336
<i>At first,</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:49.214
<i>she was only another fellow human being</i>

09:49.298 --> 09:52.968
<i>stranded on this pinpoint on the map.</i>

09:55.012 --> 09:58.015
<i>Then she was to become a female to us.</i>

09:59.975 --> 10:03.186
<i>And finally, a woman.</i>

10:03.270 --> 10:05.564
<i>The only woman on earth.</i>

10:23.540 --> 10:26.293
(Speaking Japanese)

10:48.440 --> 10:50.984
<i>Our eyes have stayed empty and remote.</i>

10:51.068 --> 10:55.614
<i>We lost track of time. The rains had started.
They seemed never to end.</i>

10:55.697 --> 11:00.285
<i>We built boats- toy boats to carry us
home on the wings of our longing.</i>

11:00.369 --> 11:02.913
<i>This lonely island was our whole world.</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.540
<i>We went to sleep at night
and dreamt of home.</i>

11:05.624 --> 11:09.378
<i>Each morning we were back on Anatahan.</i>

11:27.646 --> 11:29.981
<i>Like a rare bird of the wet jungle,</i>

11:30.065 --> 11:32.609
<i>we caught an occasional glimpse of Keiko.</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:38.907
<i>Some of us, sooner than the others,</i>

11:38.990 --> 11:41.326
<i>longed for something
more than bread alone,</i>

11:41.410 --> 11:45.122
<i>and we watched her,
and we watched each other.</i>

12:25.746 --> 12:28.123
<i>The rain stopped. Nothing lasts forever.</i>

12:28.206 --> 12:30.876
<i>Though the waves of the ocean lasted long.</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:38.550
<i>First thing we did when the hot rays
of the sun came again</i>

12:38.633 --> 12:41.720
<i>was to build a Shinto shrine
to speed our prayers.</i>

12:41.803 --> 12:43.972
<i>Most of us believed in Shintoism.</i>

12:44.055 --> 12:46.767
<i>There were two Christians, four Buddhists.</i>

12:46.850 --> 12:49.978
<i>Others believed only in Japan.</i>

12:50.061 --> 12:53.398
<i>We extracted salt from the sea,
hunted lizard and bat,</i>

12:53.482 --> 12:55.192
<i>found wild potatoes,</i>

12:55.275 --> 12:57.694
<i>lived on food that pigs would have rejected.</i>

12:57.778 --> 13:00.864
<i>But best of all,
we found a way of making fire.</i>

13:00.947 --> 13:04.201
<i>We had sunk to the level
of prehistoric man.</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:06.286
<i>But our progress was not slow.</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:10.874
<i>We achieved in weeks what the caveman
had taken centuries to accomplish.</i>

13:10.957 --> 13:12.876
<i>And so we faced our new life,</i>

13:12.959 --> 13:16.630
<i>halfway between Japan and New Guinea
on a deserted sea lane,</i>

13:16.713 --> 13:19.299
<i>1,500 miles from the Philippines,</i>

13:19.382 --> 13:21.802
<i>some 16 degrees above the equator,</i>

13:21.885 --> 13:23.929
<i>resigned to wait.</i>

13:24.012 --> 13:26.014
(Man speaks Japanese phrase)

13:32.020 --> 13:35.106
<i>The first typhoon
struck us with an unjust fury.</i>

13:35.190 --> 13:37.609
<i>What had we done to reap all this?</i>

13:37.692 --> 13:40.946
<i>Why did man and nature
conspire to make us helpless?</i>

13:41.029 --> 13:44.616
<i>The rocks that were so formidable
when we crawled ashore</i>

13:44.699 --> 13:47.869
<i>were pebbles now in a giant sea.</i>

13:47.953 --> 13:50.205
<i>It raged for three days.</i>

13:50.288 --> 13:51.998
<i>The elements are cruel.</i>

13:52.082 --> 13:54.793
<i>To the winds and to the sea,</i>

13:54.876 --> 13:58.463
<i>man and his problems is as nothing.</i>

13:58.547 --> 14:02.509
<i>The typhoon pounded at us.
The ocean wanted to wipe us out.</i>

14:02.592 --> 14:06.763
<i>This island rock that was anchored firmly
to the bottom of the deep sea</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:09.683
<i>seemed to tear loose and join the storm.</i>

14:13.770 --> 14:15.564
<i>One year on Anatahan.</i>

14:15.647 --> 14:16.982
<i>This was our home</i> now--

14:17.065 --> 14:21.069
<i>three miles long, one mile wide,
most of it impenetrable.</i>

14:21.152 --> 14:24.990
<i>We stood guard in turns to wait
for our navy to come-- it never came.</i>

14:25.073 --> 14:27.951
<i>For the enemy to come-- he never came.</i>

14:28.034 --> 14:30.370
<i>Nothing came but the waves.</i>

14:30.453 --> 14:33.039
<i>The tides lifted and the tides fell.</i>

14:33.915 --> 14:35.834
<i>We now took another step away</i>

14:35.917 --> 14:37.919
<i>from prehistoric mom.</i>

14:38.003 --> 14:40.213
<i>We had found empty beer bottles,</i>

14:40.297 --> 14:43.842
<i>and now we found a way
of filling them-- with coconut wine.</i>

14:43.925 --> 14:47.053
<i>If we drank quickly,
before it turned to vinegar,</i>

14:47.137 --> 14:50.724

The air was full of mist.</i>

<i>This method of persuasion</i>

We never saw her again.</i>
