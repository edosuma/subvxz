<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped</i>

00:08.641 --> 00:10.131

00:15.348 --> 00:17.782
<i>He awoke to find himself</i>
<i>trapped in the past,</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:21.446
<i>facing mirror images</i>
<i>that were not his own...</i>

00:21.521 --> 00:25.582
<i>and driven by an unknown force</i>
<i>to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.826 --> 00:30.762
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,</i>
<i>an observer from his own time,</i>

00:30.830 --> 00:35.494
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram</i>
<i>that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:40.836
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself</i>
<i>leaping from life to life,</i>

00:40.907 --> 00:43.273

<i>what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.343 --> 00:45.937

01:19.012 --> 01:21.037
Hey, what's gotten into you, huh?

01:21.114 --> 01:23.947
I guess I can't believe

Oh, boy.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.231
This is definitely the tomb
of Ptah-Hotep II.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.235
This is definitely his cartouche.

03:23.303 --> 03:26.500
[ Sam ]
I don't believe this.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.009
We're standing in the tomb
of Ptah-Hotep.

03:30.076 --> 03:33.443
I've dreamed about this
my whole life.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.380
Wait a minute.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.781
Where's the sarcophagus?

03:38.851 --> 03:40.819
Where's Ptah-Hotep?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.515
He's probably in
some other chamber.

03:43.590 --> 03:48.084
No. Somebody beat us to him.
Look at this.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.858
Scratch marks on the floor
where the sarcophagus was.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.365
Who's gonna steal a sarcophagus?
Not even a desperate tomb robber.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.062
Well, they do when it's solid gold.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.764
They probably broke it up
and took it out in pieces.

03:59.839 --> 04:03.138
That's right. That is right.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.337
Both the Deir el Bahri
and the Ineni Papyrus...

04:06.412 --> 04:11.679
both talked about a sarcophagus
of solid gold,

04:11.751 --> 04:13.685
but everybody thought it was a myth.

04:13.753 --> 04:17.654
W-W-Wait. The Ineni Papyrus?
Yeah, yeah.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.853
Keller and Hoskins
discovered it in 1 963.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.919
Six years from now?

04:25.965 --> 04:28.456
1 863. I'm sorry.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.799
I'm sorry. I must be confusing it
with something else.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.965
Yeah, I'd say " confusion''
is the operative word.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.343
Oh. Oh, damn, look at this.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.042
Oh, yes, this is incredible!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.949
I wish that Ptah-Hotep was here.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.280
He is.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.317
I feel it.

04:57.163 --> 05:00.030
Hey, hey, Dale. Uh-

05:00.099 --> 05:03.830
Come on. Why don't we give this place
another five minutes to air out, huh?

05:03.903 --> 05:07.361

Uh, well, I'd say that one

Great.
Let's see.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.459
Your name is Dale Conway.
Uh-huh.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.259
You're a professor of archaeology
at Kansas State University,

06:06.332 --> 06:08.766
and you're here on a- on a dig-

06:08.835 --> 06:11.463
In Egypt.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.301
In-yeah- Egypt.
In Egypt. Listen to me.

06:14.374 --> 06:19.971
You're not gonna believe this.
We just found the tomb
of King Ptah-Hotep II.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.506
It's incredible!
Go inside. Go inside.
Uh-

06:24.584 --> 06:26.745
Incredible!
Well, Ziggy says it's unbelievable,

06:26.819 --> 06:29.447
because this has never
been reported.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.456
Then I didn't just forget about it?

06:31.524 --> 06:34.425
Well, no. As of 1 999,
it's never even been discovered, ever.

06:35.495 --> 06:38.293
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>you're here on an expedition...</i>

06:38.364 --> 06:41.822
with one Ginny Will.

Uh, she's a professor of Egyptology at-

06:45.571 --> 06:48.096

Yeah.

06:48.174 --> 06:51.041
That Ginny Will?
Oh, my-
How did y-

06:51.110 --> 06:53.977
She's famous. I mean, I've read
all of her papers. She's brilliant.
Yeah. Okay.

06:54.046 --> 06:59.006
Here it comes. She and Conway
disappeared on a dig in 1 957-
Wait a second.

06:59.085 --> 07:03.886
that's this dig- and they were
swallowed up without a trace.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.991
"As for anyone who will disturb the tomb
of King Ptah-Hotep,

07:11.063 --> 07:13.463
death will swallow him.''

07:13.533 --> 07:17.196
<i>That was one of the inscriptions</i>
<i>we found in the tomb.</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.465
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>I'd say he's a man ofhis word.</i>

07:19.539 --> 07:24.033
No. No. There are thousands of inscriptions
like that in thousands of tombs.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.408
It's just put there
to scare the tomb robbers off.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.674
<i>Okay, I'm scared. Let's go.</i>

07:28.748 --> 07:32.650
No. Wait.
This is bigger than King Tut.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.913
We can't walk away from this now.

07:34.987 --> 07:38.855

This is a chance of a lifetime.

Well, so's inventing a time machine,
but, you know, quit while you're ahead.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.421
All right. Look, tell me exactly
when they disappear.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.025
How much time do we have?
Sometime between now and March 1 5.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.662
That's when the authorities
become alarmed,
then they start hunting for you.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.571
Well, the way to find out what happened
is to stick around.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.439
<i>Oh, sure. Yeah.</i>
<i>And get swallowed up.</i>

07:58.511 --> 08:02.208
<i>Dale? Dale, time's up. You ready?</i>

08:02.281 --> 08:04.215
<i>Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm almost</i>-

08:04.283 --> 08:07.878
<i>I just was practicing what I was gonna say</i>
<i>to the press about the tomb and the curse.</i>

08:07.954 --> 08:10.923
Yeah, well, I can just see
the headlines now.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.117
They are going to love this.
Yeah, I can see 'em too.

for a proper dig.

Oh, and speaking of which-

08:23.603 --> 08:27.471
- Hey, what happened toJerry Lee?
- Uh- Oh, look at this.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.008
I guess he flew the coop.

What's the matter?
Why did you scream?

08:47.293 --> 08:49.488
- Why did you scream?
- This is kind of hinky, Sam.

08:49.562 --> 08:53.328
There was a-a cobra here,
and it ate Mr. Conway's canary.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.765
The same thing happened
to Howard Carter.
It's gone. It's gone.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.235
He's the guy
that discovered the tomb of-
King Tut. That's right.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.330
Mm-hmm.
Conway, effendi,
we must leave this place.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.841
It's evil.
I told them about the curse.

09:03.910 --> 09:08.779
No, wait a second. Wait a second.
There is no curse, okay?
This is all just a coincidence.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.508
Nothing else bad is gonna happen.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.273
how do you say-
the- the- the hard way?

09:37.343 --> 09:40.710
Uh, well, yes,
it wasn't really a big move,

09:40.780 --> 09:43.510
and we started to run out
of time and money,

09:43.583 --> 09:47.542
and it was such a long trip
back to Luxor, and, well, frankly-

09:47.620 --> 09:49.554
You didn't want to go back

endless mountains of paperwork.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.688

I quite agree.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.251

such a thing as a curse could be true,
but it is.

That's his spirit body.

12:55.441 --> 12:59.502
I know what it is.
Of course you do, but it could still
be standing guard in his tomb,

12:59.578 --> 13:01.773

13:05.251 --> 13:08.846

to work magic.
Right.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.235
Some moments are not meant
to be public.

27:53.304 --> 27:55.238
I'll get my camera.
Yeah.

27:56.374 --> 28:00.105
- <i>Ptah-Hotep intact.!</i>
- [ Chuckles ]

28:00.178 --> 28:02.169
Incredible!

28:03.481 --> 28:05.472
You can say that again.

28:13.558 --> 28:16.823
Sam, did I tell you that...

28:16.895 --> 28:19.159
this place gives me
the heebie-jeebies?

28:19.230 --> 28:23.894
- Only about a million times.
- Yeah, well, now you know.

28:23.968 --> 28:28.098
Yeah, well, if you don't wanna be here,
you can go, you know?

28:28.173 --> 28:30.198
Yeah, well, no.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.675
I wanna, you know,
watch your back, and-

<i>Anyway, I wouldn't wanna miss</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind of any kind.</i>

28:36.715 --> 28:39.445
- Yeah, well, suit yourself.
- <i>[ Ginny ] Dale, I got another crowbar.</i>

28:39.517 --> 28:41.815
Great.
How we doing?

28:41.886 --> 28:44.946
Uh,just about ready.
Good, good, good.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.125
The breeze is picking up a little.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.252
Perhaps a sandstorm is approaching
after all.

28:50.328 --> 28:54.765
Yeah, uh, Sam, Ziggy says
the sandstorm will be here in 1 5 hours.

28:54.833 --> 28:58.200
All right. Now, that's it.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.760
Draw upon 'em.

29:00.839 --> 29:04.536
Now, I'm gonna pry open the lid, okay?

29:04.609 --> 29:07.601
When I do,
I'm gonna yell " pull.''

29:08.847 --> 29:11.441
You guys pull like crazy.
We'll see what happens.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.780

<i>All right.Just hold on.</i>

29:25.363 --> 29:30.630
Okay, ready?
One, two, three, pull!

29:33.271 --> 29:36.138
<i>One more time.</i>
<i>One, two, three, pull.!</i>

29:52.056 --> 29:54.149
It is magnificent!

29:55.527 --> 29:58.985
- <i>[ Sam ] It's incredible.!</i>
- It's even more amazing
than the sarcophagus.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.361
- Wow.
- I gotta get my camera.

30:01.432 --> 30:05.266
Well, so far, so good.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.631
- <i>[ Ginny ] Oh.! Damn it.!</i>
- What? What?

30:10.708 --> 30:15.611
I gotta go get more flashbulbs.
I'll be right back.
All right. Well, hurry up. We stay.

30:16.948 --> 30:21.180
What do you say we pull out the pins?
Yes, the pins.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.415
[ Ziggy Beeping ]

30:24.489 --> 30:29.188
Uh-oh, Sam. Ziggy's revising
the E.T.A. for the sandstorm.

30:29.260 --> 30:33.253
<i>It's speeding up apparently.</i>
<i>It should get here</i>
<i>in about 1 2 or 1 3 hours.</i>

30:33.331 --> 30:37.199
After that, it's <i>sayonara.</i>
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:37.268 --> 30:42.103
Well,just another pin or two here,
and we'll be ready to open her up.

30:47.111 --> 30:49.409
All set.
Great.

30:54.118 --> 30:56.609
Okay, here we go.
Ready on three.

[ Sam ] Oh, my God!
[ Al ]
I bet I know what happened.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.879
[ Sam ]
Oh, no!

31:55.947 --> 31:57.938
No, Dale!
What are you doing? Stop it!
Ali and Gamal are in there!

31:58.016 --> 32:00.450
It's too late, Doctor!
It's not too late!

32:00.518 --> 32:02.509
It's too late!

32:05.356 --> 32:08.291
This is-This is like
some horrible nightmare.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.793
I know how this started, Sam.
She started this fire...

32:10.862 --> 32:13.228
just before she came back
after reloading her camera.

32:13.298 --> 32:16.859
- I don't believe that.
- I know, my friend.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.733
It is too much tragedy to understand.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.131
Unless-

32:24.208 --> 32:26.199
Unless it's the curse.
It's not the curse!

32:26.277 --> 32:28.905
It's the curse!
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's not the curse!

32:28.980 --> 32:33.349
Look, a spark from the fire blew over there
and landed on the tent, okay?

32:33.418 --> 32:35.978
The kerosene that was in the tent
for the lanterns caught on fire.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.181
Kaboom!
That's what happened, all right?
Okay?

32:38.256 --> 32:40.417
Of course! Of course!
Ziggy says the odds...

32:40.491 --> 32:45.656
against all that stuff that's happened
happening as a coincidence is 40,000-to-1 .

32:45.730 --> 32:48.028
It's not the curse.
I can't tell you-
<i>Yes, it is.!</i>

32:48.099 --> 32:50.431
All right. I'll prove it to you
once and for all it's not the curse.
Dale? Dale!

Come on!
Dale, what are you doing?

33:00.211 --> 33:02.145

I'm gonna prove to you once and for all-
both of you-

33:05.216 --> 33:07.946
that this is nothing more
than an ordinary mummy, okay?

33:08.019 --> 33:12.353
Now, if Ptah-Hotep's ka
is still guarding this place,
Oh, Dale.

A really long lever.

Come here.
Give me a hand. Come on.

34:23.661 --> 34:27.495
[ Grunts ]
No, it's no use.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.428
I guess we're stuck here.

34:31.502 --> 34:35.302
Sam, the thing you gotta do now
is you gotta be cool.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.364
<i>That's the first thing you learn</i>
<i>as a pilot...</i>

34:37.442 --> 34:40.434

- Are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine! Yes!

Can you see a way
to move this block?

No!

He's not an engineer.
He doesn't know.

35:01.766 --> 35:05.031
How long till the sandstorm?
What?
What are you talking about?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.094
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>How long till the sandstorm hits?</i>
<i>[ Ginny ] Huh? What?</i>

35:07.171 --> 35:10.402
You got about 1 2 hours.
So, Mustafa,

35:10.475 --> 35:14.206
he could go to the nearest town and maybe
come back just in time with help.

35:14.278 --> 35:18.442
<i>Dr. Razul,you have to go</i>
<i>and get help.!</i>

35:18.516 --> 35:21.679

Don't worry!
I will get you out!

Yeah.

Oh, let's hope
that steering rod holds.

Yeah.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.828
Well, Sam, uh, Ziggy says
that you got plenty of air in here.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.098
You got at least
two days' worth of air.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.106
But, of course, you'd better
get out of here before then,

35:43.174 --> 35:47.042
because you'll be buried
under 50 feet of sand dunes.
[ Chuckling ]

35:47.111 --> 35:51.047
- Sorry.
- <i>[ Sam ] Come on.</i>

35:51.115 --> 35:55.176
Let's, uh, see if there's
a back door to this place, huh?

35:55.253 --> 35:58.984
Yeah. Wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, boy, I hate to say it.

35:59.056 --> 36:02.514
But sitting here looking at these walls
makes me a little claustrophobic.

36:02.593 --> 36:05.562
It's hardly a good trait
for an archaeologist, huh?

36:05.630 --> 36:08.030
Maybe this'll take my mind off of it.

36:09.066 --> 36:13.059

36:13.137 --> 36:15.503

She probably saw the walls
closing in on her, the poor kid.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.505
That'd be the frosting on the curse,
wouldn't it?

36:23.581 --> 36:26.846
Walls closing in?

36:26.918 --> 36:30.251

and smaller...

and smaller...

or breathe or anything?

on tomb design there...
Okay.

or maybe something on how to get around
the booby traps in here, you know.
Okay. Yeah.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.503
But I'll be back, Sam.
I'll be right back. You know,

What's back with the wrong-up-
What's wrong with the backups?

37:16.167 --> 37:20.831
No, he-Well, he
says there's kind of a gridlock
with the signals through the door...

37:20.905 --> 37:25.808
that were maybe caused by
that chip that malfunctioned
and set off a chain reaction.

37:25.876 --> 37:29.437

You're just gonna be stuck here
a little while.

[ Sighs ]

38:41.052 --> 38:43.987
You put out some bait.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.523
Yeah, and we get the trap
like the proverbial rat.

38:46.590 --> 38:51.892
Right. But, eventually,
you wanna get outta here too, right?
Uh-huh.

38:51.962 --> 38:55.898
So you build a back door.
We already thought of that.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.901
Or you build it so that
you can reopen the trap.

38:58.969 --> 39:02.496
Either way, you need a key.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.635
Probably.
Hopefully.

Maybe.

39:10.047 --> 39:12.538
Where do you keep your keys?

but then I thought...

41:22.746 --> 41:27.240
perhaps things would work out
a great deal better for me if I just...

41:33.958 --> 41:38.520
That is so crass-sounding, but, yes.

41:38.596 --> 41:42.555
So you killed Ali and Gamal.
Now you're gonna kill us.

41:42.633 --> 41:48.230

My dear Dr. Will,
I have never killed anyone in my life.

41:48.305 --> 41:53.299
I actually thought it was either you
or Dr. Conway who had
dispatched with the others.

41:53.377 --> 41:57.541
Perhaps they were just accidents
after all, huh?

41:57.615 --> 41:59.640
Which is all about to change now.

41:59.717 --> 42:04.120
A king's ransom could let one live
like a prince...

42:04.188 --> 42:06.986
for a very long time.

42:07.057 --> 42:11.551
And with the Heart of Ptah-Hotep,
well-

42:11.629 --> 42:14.462
I think it's time we go inside, huh?

42:20.070 --> 42:22.504
Stall him until me and Ziggy
can figure something out.

42:22.573 --> 42:25.041
Two questions, Dr. Conway.

42:25.109 --> 42:27.441
What set off the booby trap?

42:28.445 --> 42:32.245
And, uh, however did you
get out of here?

42:32.316 --> 42:34.250
<i>Just stall, Sam, stall.</i>

42:34.318 --> 42:36.752
I haven't got anything on here yet.

42:38.088 --> 42:41.080
Well, sometimes it's not a good idea
to tempt fate twice.

42:44.328 --> 42:46.990
But if you really want to know,

42:49.567 --> 42:55.096
we, uh, took out the Heart...

42:55.172 --> 42:57.800
and then put it back.

43:09.753 --> 43:12.244
Thank you, Dr. Conway.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.689
I hope you appreciate
your accommodations.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.352
<i>[ Rumbling ]</i>

43:25.235 --> 43:28.295
You did it, Sam.
Great! You did it!

43:28.372 --> 43:30.363
You okay? You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.137
Get this.
No matter how hard you try,

43:33.210 --> 43:35.644
you- I mean, Dale- and Ginny-
You sure you're all right?

43:35.713 --> 43:39.012
never find the tomb
of Ptah-Hotep again.

43:39.083 --> 43:42.382
What about Razul?
Uh, I got nothin' on him. Nothin'.

43:42.453 --> 43:46.981
<i>Dr. Will, Dr. Conway,</i>
<i>I can't get the Heart back in.!</i>

43:49.426 --> 43:53.522
- We can't-We can't just leave him in there.
- Please, you must help me get out!

43:53.597 --> 43:56.589
Sam, that sandstorm's
gonna be here any second.

44:00.004 --> 44:02.905
All right, all right.
Go to the back wall.

44:02.973 --> 44:05.373
Now, this is weird.
You know that chip...

44:05.442 --> 44:08.411
that opens the imaging chamber door,
it didn't fail.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.413
Look for Nephthys and Isis.

44:10.481 --> 44:14.212
The whole thing was caused
by a new program that Ziggy just got-

44:15.219 --> 44:18.017
[ Sighs ]
from Egypt.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.249
All right! I've found them!

44:20.324 --> 44:22.451
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Put your hands on their faces.</i>

44:23.560 --> 44:25.585
Yes?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.654
<i>And push.</i>

44:31.568 --> 44:33.559
It's working!

44:43.847 --> 44:48.113
Dr. Razul! Dr. Razul!
<i>[ Razul Screaming ]</i>

44:48.185 --> 44:51.086
- We've gotta get in there.
- Don't look at me.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.146
Dr. Razul, what is happening?
Al, go!

44:53.223 --> 44:56.215
No, you can't get through here.
Go!

44:56.293 --> 44:58.284
Okay.
<i>[ Screaming Continues ]</i>

44:58.362 --> 45:00.796
I really don't like this.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.036
He's killing him.

45:07.104 --> 45:09.504
Ptah-Hotep is killing him.
What?

45:13.210 --> 45:17.146
<i>[ Screaming Stops ]</i>
<i>[ Rumbling ]</i>

45:19.616 --> 45:22.779
<i>Better get outta here, Sam.!</i>
<i>[ Rumbling Continues ]</i>

45:25.456 --> 45:28.152
We gotta go. Come on. Come on!

45:28.225 --> 45:30.284
No, what are you doing?
What about Razul?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.521
He's dead.
Go.

45:32.596 --> 45:35.190
Ptah-Hotep killed him. Go!

45:35.265 --> 45:37.256
Go!
Go!

45:47.745 --> 45:50.646
So, what did the cop say?

45:50.714 --> 45:53.842
Probably said you should
get yourself a day job.
<i>[ Audience Chuckling ]</i>

45:53.917 --> 45:56.886
[ Chuckling ]
Hey, buddy, what did you do?

45:56.954 --> 45:58.979
Escape from a home
for the comedically stunted...

45:59.056 --> 46:01.217
or just the hopelessly stupid, huh?
<i>* [ Rim Shot ]</i>

46:02.760 --> 46:07.197
Stay with me, will ya, Davey?
Uh, yeah.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.164
Well, this cop said that-

46:09.233 --> 46:11.167
He was hauling you in.
He was hauling me in.

46:11.235 --> 46:13.465
And-And I was-
Naked.

46:13.537 --> 46:16.404
Naked. And then-

46:16.473 --> 46:18.941
Hiding in the bushes.
Hiding- Hiding in the bushes.

46:19.009 --> 46:22.206
And, uh, well-
And you were holding this sheep,

46:22.279 --> 46:25.271
<i>and then you said</i>-

46:28.051 --> 46:29.985
Oh, boy?

46:30.053 --> 46:32.613
