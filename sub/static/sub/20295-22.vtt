-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.933
in a court of law.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.333
-Man: I was a troubled kid.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.400
Uh, you know,
I had anger issues,

00:46.433 --> 00:49.800
and my uncle, a retired
sheriff's sergeant
from this department,

00:49.833 --> 00:51.367
kinda help mentor me.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.833
Watching him being a cop,

00:52.867 --> 00:54.800
I knew that's what I wanted
to do

00:54.833 --> 00:56.500
ever since I was
about five years old.

00:56.533 --> 00:58.900
Thank goodness for him
being a good role model,

00:58.933 --> 01:04.133
'cause he's helped set me up
for success,

01:04.167 --> 01:05.867
even though he doesn't know it.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.400
So we just ran a license plate,

01:08.433 --> 01:10.533
and it came back lost or stolen,

01:10.567 --> 01:12.367
so we're gonna try
and catch up to it,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.200
and do a vehicle stop.

01:14.233 --> 01:18.233
-(siren)
-Oh, yeah.

01:18.267 --> 01:24.633
And Main 15 X-ray in pursuit,
eastbound past Fulton.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.600
-(indistinct radio transmission)
-So this is a stolen
license plate,

01:28.633 --> 01:31.133
but they're not stopping...
-(siren)

01:31.167 --> 01:34.800
-and
it could have a good chance
of it being a stolen car.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.800
-(siren)
-Looks like an Explorer
with two,

01:37.833 --> 01:40.933
has a luggage rack on top,
speeds are only 40.

01:40.967 --> 01:45.200
-(indistinct radio transmission)

01:57.767 --> 02:01.833
-M 15 X-ray,
I was just wondering if, Sam,
you have moderate rate,

02:01.867 --> 02:05.533
if we have permission
to PIT or not?

02:05.567 --> 02:10.833
-(over radio) 23 Sam.
If the conditions and
speeds permit, you can PIT.

02:10.867 --> 02:14.500
-M 15 X-ray,
he's in the southbound lane--

02:14.533 --> 02:17.833
Oh, I'm sorry. Northbound lane,
he's driving south.

02:19.533 --> 02:22.700
-(over radio) Southbound Sunrise
is a mess.

02:22.733 --> 02:27.800
-Uh, we do have a good
(indistinct), but now he's
heading eastbound Wildridge.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.300
Speeds
are approximately 65, uh,

02:36.333 --> 02:39.533
no traffic
and no pedestrians

02:39.567 --> 02:40.800
on the side of the road.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.233
If we have an air available.

02:42.267 --> 02:45.800
He ran a stop sign at Morse.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.733
Since there's still
a little bit of distance,
I'll continue to call it.

02:49.767 --> 02:53.633
We're gonna
be southbound, Ridgevale.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.100
We're gonna
be eastbound, Ridgemont.

02:59.133 --> 03:02.700
-Dead end, there might
be a foot pursuit.

03:02.733 --> 03:06.467
-(sirens)
-Put your hands up! Driver!

03:06.500 --> 03:08.733
Stick your hands out
the window now, sir!

03:08.767 --> 03:09.933
-On your right! On your right!

03:09.967 --> 03:12.133
-Stick your hands out!

03:12.167 --> 03:14.167
Driver, open up
the car door, sir!

03:14.200 --> 03:16.900
Open up the door,
keep your hands
where I can see 'em

03:16.933 --> 03:18.667
when you step out.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.467
-(dog barking)

03:20.500 --> 03:23.733
Okay.
Keep your hands up!

03:25.867 --> 03:27.733
Put your hands
behind your head!

03:27.767 --> 03:31.233
Walk back to the sound
of my voice.
Walk back, walk back.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.300
Keep walking back, sir.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.467
Stop.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.200
-(barking continuing)

03:43.100 --> 03:45.567
-Is there anyone else
in there?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.933
Anyone else, come on out!
You're gonna get bit
if you don't come out!

03:55.833 --> 03:59.067
-Main 15 X-ray, car's clear,
go and resume.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.133
-Anyone not 97
can Code 4, please.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.500
Hey, I'm gonna
take a statement from him...
-All right.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.233
-...since he was evading.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.967
-What's your name, sir?
-Austin.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.333
-Austin, what's your last name?

04:11.367 --> 04:14.667
I wanna ask you
some questions about stuff
that went on tonight.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.767
Why did you decide to run?

04:16.800 --> 04:20.267
-'Cause I'm on parole.
-Do you have a warrant out?

04:20.300 --> 04:23.233
-Nah, no.
I just got out,
I did two and a half years.

04:23.267 --> 04:27.267
-Okay. But, you know,
people are on parole
all the time, and get contact.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.967
All we do is say,
"Hi. How ya doin'?"

04:30.067 --> 04:35.067
So why would you run
and cause, potentially,
a risk to the public?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.700
Right? I mean, you were drivin'
the wrong way, sir.

04:37.733 --> 04:39.900
Cars were comin' at you.

04:39.933 --> 04:45.067
All right, let me ask you this:
How did you come in possession
of that car, sir?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.833
-It was...
-What's that?

04:46.867 --> 04:49.733
-Through like a... a friend.
-How long have you had it?

04:49.767 --> 04:53.467
-I just-- (mumbling)

04:53.500 --> 04:55.633
-I'm sorry, what was that?
-A day maybe, I don't...

04:55.667 --> 04:56.733
-A day?

04:56.767 --> 04:59.100
Did you get the key
from somebody?

05:01.733 --> 05:03.067
Who'd you get the key from?

05:03.067 --> 05:05.067
-I don't-- (mumbling)

05:05.100 --> 05:07.467
-Can you tell me
where you picked up the car at,
what neighborhood?

05:07.500 --> 05:12.167
-It-- No, I'm not
sayin' no more. I'm--
I'm ready to go to jail.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.233
-Okay, sir.

05:15.567 --> 05:19.300
There's a small amount of weed
in the grand scheme of life,

05:19.333 --> 05:22.600
but... if he doesn't
have a medical marijuana card,

05:22.633 --> 05:24.700
he's gonna probably
get charged with that.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.167
It's a misdemeanor
to have it in your vehicle.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.200
Uh, the knife was actually found
in between the center console
and driver's seat,

05:31.233 --> 05:32.567
so he had that next to him.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.700
So I don't know
if he's usin' that
as protection.

05:34.733 --> 05:38.267
There's a lot of property
in here. We don't know
if it's his,

05:38.300 --> 05:40.933
if someone was a victim
of a property crime.

05:40.967 --> 05:46.533
There's some IDs of people.
We need to make sure
they're not victims.

05:46.567 --> 05:49.167
-He came back as Austin,
but there's a Jacob one,

05:49.200 --> 05:52.833
and then there's a passport
for a different person in there.

05:52.867 --> 05:56.067
-Someone's passports
were taken in a vehicle burg
this morning...

05:56.100 --> 05:58.600
-Mm-hm.
-...in North Highland, so...

05:58.633 --> 06:00.833
I don't remember the name,
but let's make sure--

06:00.867 --> 06:03.400
Let's run him,
see where he might live,
or any contacts.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.233
-Part of a (indistinct) event
or something like that.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.733
-And see if maybe
he's a victim.
-Yeah.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.433
-If we get a phone number,
let's contact him
and get a statement.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.467
-Okay.
-Um, and see
if he knows this guy.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.533
-All right.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.400
-So Tim, did you get any update
on that VIN?

06:15.433 --> 06:19.067
-Yeah, we ran it backwards
and it turns out
that it came back stolen.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.200
-All right. Thank you.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.200
Okay, Austin. So, um...

06:25.233 --> 06:30.533
right now, we found out
the car was reported stolen
a couple weeks ago, okay?

06:30.567 --> 06:34.233
So you're gonna be goin' to jail
for, uh, the stolen vehicle,

06:34.267 --> 06:38.167
possession
of the stolen property,
the felony evading,

06:38.200 --> 06:42.200
driving recklessly,
and parole violation.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.633
And you understand
you put a lot of people's lives
in danger, right,

06:44.667 --> 06:48.967
not only law enforcement,
but the citizen,
cars, pedestrians,

06:49.067 --> 06:50.700
you understand that?

06:50.733 --> 06:54.600
-I don't know, man,
(bleep) happens.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.667
-Okay.
Anything else
you wanna tell me?

06:57.700 --> 07:00.067
No? Okay.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.100
I'm just glad
he didn't hurt anybody
through the whole process.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.133
-Woman: My boyfriend is also
a deputy, so on my last shift,
I actually got engaged.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.567
My zone partner asked me
to come search a female
for him,

07:15.600 --> 07:17.700
and I was ready to go home,
so I didn't wanna do it,

07:17.733 --> 07:21.067
but I went there,
and my fiance surprised me

07:21.067 --> 07:22.133
at the end of my shift.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.733
All of a sudden,
all of our family and friends

07:23.767 --> 07:26.267
came out, out of nowhere,
and he got down on one knee

07:26.300 --> 07:29.533
and proposed to me,
and now I'm engaged!

07:29.567 --> 07:33.800
-(indistinct radio transmission)
-Um, we're going
on a domestic in progress.

07:33.833 --> 07:36.833
Apparently, the boyfriend
and girlfriend got into it.

07:36.867 --> 07:43.567
Boyfriend broke girlfriend's
car window and is supposed
to have a handgun.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.933
So... we're gonna see
what's goin' on.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.633
-Where's he at?
-He's sittin' on the bed

07:55.667 --> 07:58.333
tryin' to act like
he not doin' nothin'
'cause y'all are showin' up.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.067
-What's his name?
-Michael.

08:00.067 --> 08:04.400
-Hang on, stay out.
Michael! Hey, come here
and let me see your hands.

08:04.433 --> 08:06.300
Come here and let me see
your hands, let's go.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.467
Both your hands.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.767
Hands! Stand up.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.100
Michael:
You can't come in.
-No, we're gonna come in.

08:11.133 --> 08:14.633
-Turn around.
75 Hillsborough.

08:14.667 --> 08:19.633
-Yeah, my gun is--
-Hey! Don't reach for anything,
because I'll-- Don't do it.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.433
You understand me?
-Yes.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.133
-Where's this alleged gun?
-It's in my-- right here.

08:25.167 --> 08:26.667
-Stop!
-I'm showin' him where it's at.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.400
-If you reach for it
one more time-- Ah-ah-ah!
Don't play with me.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.767
Do you understand me?
-I was only-- It's in front--
It's in front of me.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.067
It's in front of me, sir.
I'll tell you where it's at.
-Take-- Stop.

08:34.067 --> 08:36.600
-You're not being arrested
or anything, it's just for
for our safety, okay?

08:36.633 --> 08:40.200
-I'm tellin' you
the gun is in front of me.

08:40.233 --> 08:42.100
-All right, listen,
next time you have a gun on you,

08:42.133 --> 08:44.700
do not point to it,
do not reach to it,
do not anything,

08:44.733 --> 08:46.600
because I'm tellin' you
right now, I do not play.

08:46.633 --> 08:49.067
Where our mind goes first
is that you're pullin' it out
for a reason.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.267
You feel me?
-Yeah.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.067
-Okay.
-Right there. Right there.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.500
The gun was not pulled, though.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.900
-Do you have
your concealed weapon permit?

08:54.933 --> 08:56.600
-Yes. And she has
my other gun, my .380.

08:56.633 --> 08:58.433
-(woman speaks indistinctly)
-She has that.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.167
-Woman:
It's in the car
in my protection.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.467
-Corso:
Where is that?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.267
-Woman:
It's in the car,
in the glove compartment.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.933
-You don't have it on you?
-I don't have it on me.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.300
-All right.
-Man:
That's it. That's all.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.433
-Do you live here?
-Man: Yes.

09:07.467 --> 09:08.633
-Does she live here?
-Yes.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.233
-Have a seat right here.
Right here.

09:10.267 --> 09:12.733
What's goin' on?
-What happened is,
she didn't come home,

09:12.767 --> 09:14.633
So I go by the house that
she was cheatin' on me with.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.267
I'm like,
"What you doin' here?"

09:16.300 --> 09:19.567
-So you found her at her...
-At the dude she was cheatin'
on me house.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.200
-Okay, you found her
there tonight.
-Yes.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.433
-Okay.

09:22.467 --> 09:24.767
-So, we had got into it.
After we got into it--

09:24.800 --> 09:26.267
-What do you mean
by you got into it?

09:26.300 --> 09:27.667
-I was like,
"What you doin' here?"

09:27.700 --> 09:29.133
She's like, "I'm not doin'--"
-Just arguin'?

09:29.167 --> 09:30.500
-Yeah, just arguin'.
-Okay.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.567
-Okay. She left, I left.
We went two different ways.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.367
I came home.
When I came home,

09:36.400 --> 09:40.067
she said her family
not lettin' me in the house--
-And you live here?

09:40.067 --> 09:41.333
-I stay here.
-How long have you--

09:41.367 --> 09:43.167
How long have you lived here?
-Since January.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.300
-Okay. You have a key?
-Yes.

09:45.333 --> 09:49.133
-Okay.
-So, after that,
I was like...

09:49.167 --> 09:51.467
The uncle, he asked me,
he's like--
-Is that her uncle?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.833
-Yes.
-Okay.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.733
-He's like, "Well, you gotta
stay outside till she get here."

09:54.767 --> 09:56.767
I'm like, "Bro, I'm gonna
lay down in my bed."
-Okay.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.100
-And she walked in the house
and started throwin'
all my stuff.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.600
She yelled at them
for lettin' me in the house--

10:01.633 --> 10:03.267
-The mom did?
-No, the daughter.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.533
-She yelled at them.
-She yelled at them
for lettin' me in the house.

10:05.567 --> 10:08.233
Then she came in the house,
started snatchin' my stuff
in the hall, tellin' me,

10:08.267 --> 10:10.133
"You gotta get outta here
tonight," stuff like that.

10:10.167 --> 10:11.633
"You gonna leave here
one way or the other.

10:11.667 --> 10:12.800
You gettin' outta
here tonight."

10:12.833 --> 10:14.533
-Did it ever get physical
between the two of you?

10:14.567 --> 10:16.967
-No. I sittin' on the edge
of the bed, uncle was standing
there next to me...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.200
-So you never put
your hands on her?

10:18.233 --> 10:20.233
-No. The uncle--
-Okay, what about the--

10:20.267 --> 10:23.200
-The uncle was tryin'
to get me to leave.
-What's this deal with the gun?

10:23.233 --> 10:24.933
Did you show the gun?
-No.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.367
-She just knows that you keep
a gun on you.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.733
She knows I keep my gun on me.
-Okay.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.700
-I think. Because...
-You have
a concealed weapons permit?

10:30.733 --> 10:33.133
-Yes, I have a concealed
weapons-- She has one, too.
-Okay.

10:33.167 --> 10:36.033
-Like that. And like I said,
she has my .380,
and I have a nine.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.300
That's how she knew
it was a nine.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.833
She couldn't describe it
'cause I never pulled it.

10:38.867 --> 10:41.067
-So you never pulled a gun.
What's she gonna tell me?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.733
Is she gonna tell me
that you pulled a gun on her?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.567
Is she gonna tell me
that you punched her
in the face,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.200
that you spit on her?
-No.

10:46.233 --> 10:50.267
-What-- Okay, did you bash in
a car window?
-Broke a window to the car.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.033
-I think. That's it.
-Okay.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.733
-That's the-- that's
the mostest thing
she can say is I--

10:55.767 --> 10:56.900
I hit the window of the car.

10:56.933 --> 10:58.733
And...
-Was she in the car
when you did that?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.100
-She was--
she was gettin' in the car.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.700
-She was gettin' in it,
and you punched it.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.067
Or you hit it with something.
-No. I hit it with my hand.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.167
It was-- it was--
You know how you get
in the heat of the moment,

11:06.200 --> 11:09.367
it was either, I can hit you,
I can hit somethin' else.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.167
-Okay.
-Yeah.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.967
-All right. Sit tight
for just a second.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.800
Ma'am, can you come here
real quick?

11:15.833 --> 11:18.200
Okay, what happened
between you guys?

11:18.233 --> 11:22.400
-I left my cousin's house.
I went to a friend's house
who I had relations with before,

11:22.433 --> 11:25.100
but we're just friends,
we always been friends
before anything.

11:25.133 --> 11:28.533
So I'm over there, and I believe
he has some type
of trackin' device on me,

11:28.567 --> 11:32.133
or he's been stalkin' me
because he always find me.
-Okay.

11:32.167 --> 11:35.333
So he comes over there,
and he's like, "What you doing,
cheating on me?"

11:35.367 --> 11:37.233
And I'm like, "No, I'm just
chillin', you're trippin'."

11:37.267 --> 11:39.833
And so, that's when he,
"Oh, I should kill you,"

11:39.867 --> 11:41.733
like he drawed his hand up,
"Oh, I should kill you--"

11:41.767 --> 11:44.067
-And this
was at the friend's house?
-That was at the friend's house.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.300
And then, that's when, um,
I was like, "Do it! Do it!"

11:47.333 --> 11:49.700
And then-- and then
he like, grabbed me
'round my neck,

11:49.733 --> 11:52.500
like this,
and then, um, I pushed him away,

11:52.533 --> 11:55.100
and then that's
when he put his hand
like this, he just said,

11:55.133 --> 11:56.867
"I ought to kill you,
I'll kill you."

11:56.900 --> 11:58.767
And I was like,
"What you gonna do, take me
from my kids?"

11:58.800 --> 12:00.400
And he was like, "Yeah."

12:00.433 --> 12:02.700
I was tryin' to get in my car
to leave the situation
and all that,

12:02.733 --> 12:04.333
and he punched my window.
-Mm-hm.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.733
-He did not break it,
so then that's when
he grabbed his gun,

12:06.767 --> 12:09.733
and he hit it.
-Okay, so you're backing up...

12:09.767 --> 12:11.133
-Mm-hm.
-...and he punches it...

12:11.167 --> 12:13.067
-Uh-huh.
-...and it didn't do anything
to the window

12:13.067 --> 12:14.467
when he punched it,
-No.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.533
-And then he got his gun out
and hit it with the butt
of the gun?

12:16.567 --> 12:18.133
-Yup.
-Okay.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.733
-Just give me one second.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.067
-So I'm gettin' arrested?
-Hold on one second.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.067
-I didn't do nothing. You--
If you go in the house
and look,

12:25.067 --> 12:27.800
only my stuff has been moved.
I haven't moved nothin'.
-Just have a seat right there.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.500
You're goin' to jail today
for aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon--

12:30.533 --> 12:31.900
-What I did?
I didn't pull no weapon.

12:31.933 --> 12:33.367
-Are you gonna let me
finish talking?
-Okay.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.633
-Okay, and you're
also goin' to jail today
for simple battery.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.767
Um, let-- let me--
let me explain somethin' to you,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.833
it's domestic violence.
You guys live together

12:39.867 --> 12:42.767
as a family. She's makin'
these allegations against you,

12:42.800 --> 12:45.067
therefore,
we don't have a choice--
-She did stuff to me,

12:45.100 --> 12:48.800
but, I'm like...
I'm not gonna argue,
I'm gonna sit right here.

12:48.833 --> 12:51.167
So for sitting right here,
I'm still gettin' screwed.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.067
-This is what she's alleging...
-I-- I would've came out better
defendin' myself.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.900
But I set right there
and let her hit me--

12:56.933 --> 12:58.433
-Corso:
Well, don't make it worse
for yourself.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.233
-But I'm sayin',
I let her hit me--

13:00.267 --> 13:01.433
-Well, Michael, at first
you told me

13:01.467 --> 13:02.867
that it wasn't physical
between you guys.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.967
-It wasn't.
-But if she was hitting you,
it was physical.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.567
-She always throws stuff.
That's her.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.633
Remember when I showed you--
I showed you on the wall.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.533
I said, "Look, see
this red thing right here?"

13:11.567 --> 13:13.900
She hit me in my elbow
with it, and threw it at me,
and it hit the wall?

13:13.933 --> 13:15.633
I told you that.
-Okay.

13:15.667 --> 13:19.067
-But--
-Well, listen, you're gonna
have-- y'all are gonna have

13:19.067 --> 13:22.700
your day in court, okay?
And-- and it's gonna
get figured out from there.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.533
But hopefully
this is an eye-opener
for you.

13:24.567 --> 13:27.233
Maybe you should probably
think about dating
someone else.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.167
-So I've been workin'
at Southeast
for about a year now.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.700
I moved here when I became
an FTO.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.867
I love workin' at this job.
Gives me a good opportunity

13:36.900 --> 13:39.300
to train the new guys
and teach 'em
how to be a good cop

13:39.333 --> 13:41.367
and do all the right things.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.367
It's always rewarding
when the lightbulb clicks

13:43.400 --> 13:45.567
in their mind, and they
can actually, you know,

13:45.600 --> 13:48.767
start to really see
how the job operates.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.233
So we're en route
to a family disturbance here.

13:52.267 --> 13:56.200
There's about four or five
subjects that are fighting
and arguing

13:56.233 --> 13:58.067
outside of a restaurant.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.800
It appears that there's one male
that's being the agitator.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.867
We should be gettin' there
any second.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.200
-(over radio): Car 17 John-One.
41-63 Balboa Avenue. Male...

14:10.233 --> 14:11.433
-What's up, man?

14:11.467 --> 14:12.700
Come over here and talk to me.

14:12.733 --> 14:14.967
-Me and one of these guys
over here, we get into it.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.500
Younger guy, you know,
we start goin' at it.

14:17.533 --> 14:19.533
He drops his pants,
puts his ass in my face.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.067
And I was like, no,
we can go outside.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.867
Me and my mom packed
her stuff up.

14:23.900 --> 14:26.567
We're sittin' right here
waitin' on the bus,
here they come walkin' up.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.067
-So, all those people,
you don't know them?

14:29.067 --> 14:31.400
They're just homeless people
who live around you guys?

14:31.433 --> 14:33.867
-No, no, they live right
there in the apartment.
They're all high on drugs.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.800
-But they're not related
to you in any way?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.667
-No, no, they're related
to the one lady and the sister.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.167
They're all junkies.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.100
-Okay.
-So they're all gonna lie,
and they're gonna tell you,

14:41.133 --> 14:42.867
"Oh, we don't know this one,
we don't know this one."

14:42.900 --> 14:44.233
I told them this morning,
"You know what?

14:44.267 --> 14:45.900
"I got a two-year-old
and a six-month-old in here,

14:45.933 --> 14:47.667
"and you guys are smokin'
crystal meth.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.067
I'm gonna call CPS,
solve the problem right there."

14:50.100 --> 14:52.867
-Okay.
-Uh, they caused a huge fit
over that.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.633
"Well, you come around here,
we'll (bleep) kill you.
We'll kill you.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.067
You call CPS..."
he goes on and on and on.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.267
All right, so we and my mom's
been sittin' outside all day.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.200
I'm sittin' right over here,
waitin' for the bus to come.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.333
-Okay.
-They come walkin' up.
Here comes five of 'em.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.667
Me and my mom's tryin'
to walk away, he keeps comin',
keeps comin'.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.067
He goes up to my mom,
so naturally I jumped up...

15:10.100 --> 15:12.167
-What did he--
Did he hit your mom?
-Yeah, he broke her jaw.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.933
She's sittin' right down there.
She don't wanna talk.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.433
-Okay.
So you're Mom?

15:16.467 --> 15:18.167
-I don't know
if it's broken.
I mean, it jarred

15:18.200 --> 15:19.767
the whole side
of my head over here.

15:19.800 --> 15:24.067
-Okay. So, what--
Who's the one
who hit you, initially?

15:24.067 --> 15:25.933
-The...
Man: Mike,
the one with the hat.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.133
-Mikey, the one with the hat.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.300
-Let her answer.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.633
-The older one.
-Okay.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.400
-The older one.
-Okay, so was he wearin'
a black jacket

15:31.433 --> 15:34.967
or not wearin' a black jacket?
-I can't remember.
He's the oldest one.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.200
-The oldest one?
-Yeah.

15:36.233 --> 15:37.967
-And he hit you straight
in the jaw?
-Yes, he did.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.933
-Okay. I'll talk to them,
and then we'll figure out

15:39.967 --> 15:42.333
what's goin' on here
in a second.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.433
Can you come over here
and tell me what's goin' on?

15:46.300 --> 15:47.733
I'm gonna have you stand
in front of my car.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.800
I'm gonna talk to you
real quick, okay?

15:49.833 --> 15:51.967
So can you explain to me
what happened today?

15:52.067 --> 15:56.067
-I was told that my boy

15:56.100 --> 15:59.333
disrespected the house
accidentally.

15:59.367 --> 16:03.333
His mom is on life support,
and he's not thinkin' right.

16:03.367 --> 16:07.167
And he came in the front
of the-- from the bedroom
to the livin' room

16:07.200 --> 16:11.667
to get his phone,
and his button unpopped
accidentally...

16:11.700 --> 16:13.933
-Okay.
-...and his pants
fell to the back, and--

16:13.967 --> 16:15.600
-That was yesterday.
-Right.

16:15.633 --> 16:18.733
-Okay.
-So the bigger gentleman
went face-to-face

16:18.767 --> 16:22.567
and threatened him,
saying, lift your pants
or respect the house.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.833
You know, the bigger gentleman
in the back there.
-So you tried to confront him

16:26.867 --> 16:28.367
about it?
-Right.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.800
-Did you ever at any point
in time punch the female?
-Yes, sir, I did.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.933
-You did.
-Yes, sir.

16:32.967 --> 16:34.367
-You punched her square
in her jaw?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.167
-Yeah, I was goin'
for him, though.
-You was goin' for him.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.967
-Goin' for him.
-And you punched her
square in her jaw.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.500
-Yes, sir. Here's what happened,
God's honest truth.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.233
I didn't know this.
-Okay.

16:43.267 --> 16:48.300
-My boy says and they sayin'
that she's comin' with a knife.
-Okay.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.067
-To help out her boy.
-Okay.

16:51.067 --> 16:55.067
-Meanwhile, my boy,
while I'm watchin',
'cause he knocked me down

16:55.067 --> 16:57.067
once already.
-Okay.

16:57.100 --> 17:02.600
-As I'm gettin' up,
I'm goin' to get--
I see my boy get hit.

17:02.633 --> 17:06.667
So I wanna show him
what it feels like.
So when I go in...

17:06.700 --> 17:09.100
-Okay.
-...she's already here.
She's already there.

17:09.133 --> 17:11.300
-And you
just clocked her in the face.
-And it went right in,

17:11.333 --> 17:14.233
up or I think I got her up--
goin' upward.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.533
I was aimin' up.
-Okay.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.500
-So like an uppercut.

17:18.533 --> 17:21.467
-Not an uppercut,
but I was goin' up.
-Okay.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.900
-I wanted to go under
like my son got it.
-Okay.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.467
Stay right there.
I'm gonna get the son,

17:25.500 --> 17:26.933
and I'm gonna bring him
over here.
-Yes, sir.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.633
-We'll figure out
what's goin' on.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.767
-My son is no big grown
man, either. Believe me,
you don't know these people.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.933
-Okay.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.567
-Brian, I know what your dad
told me already.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.767
I just wanna hear
the whole story from your
point of view.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.600
-The problem that I had
with them earlier is that
I didn't pull up my pants.

17:39.633 --> 17:42.400
-Okay, so you
didn't pull up your pants.
-Yeah, and then he threatened me

17:42.433 --> 17:46.367
to uh... beat me up,
and then we seen him over there,
so we went to go talk to him

17:46.400 --> 17:52.067
and then what he did
was... throw a punch,
knocked me down.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.167
-Who was the first one
that threw the first punch?
-Him.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.600
-He threw a first punch?
-Yes.

17:55.633 --> 17:58.133
-Okay.
-And it wasn't a first punch,
it was a first punch,

17:58.167 --> 18:00.600
second punch, third punch--
-Okay, so once he started
punching you,

18:00.633 --> 18:03.733
you guys just kinda went back
at him, defending yourself.
-Exactly.

18:03.767 --> 18:07.567
-Okay. Well, this is the thing,
okay? Nobody else was involved
in the fight but you two

18:07.600 --> 18:09.067
and those two, right?

18:09.067 --> 18:11.300
Like, none of the girls
over here were involved?
-Right.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.967
All three of us
punched together,
in other words.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.267
-Okay, hold on.
-Woman:
I got pushed.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.500
-Okay. Can you stay
over there for me for now?

18:17.533 --> 18:20.067
As of right now,
it's gonna be just
a battery charge.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.767
I'm gonna go and talk to them,
and if they don't wanna
press charges,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.500
then, do you guys
wanna press charges?

18:24.533 --> 18:27.300
-If I know my son
could walk the streets,

18:27.333 --> 18:30.600
and he could go to the store
safely, come home safely,

18:30.633 --> 18:34.100
and nothin' will happen to him,
from that particular individual,

18:34.133 --> 18:38.067
then I will have
no problems whatsoever.
-Squashin' everything.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.667
-Squashed.
-Okay. Well, I will talk
to him, and I will see

18:40.700 --> 18:43.067
what he wants to say
about it. Okay?

18:43.067 --> 18:45.467
So, just give me a second,
I want both of you guys
to stay right here

18:45.500 --> 18:48.467
for me? Okay?
Don't leave yet.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.233
So, you had an incident
with the son. Dad said,

18:52.267 --> 18:54.333
"Hey, I want to confront him
about being mean to my son."

18:54.367 --> 18:57.233
-That's...
-Somehow, words got exchanged,

18:57.267 --> 19:01.733
a fight ensued
between you and-- you--
you two and them two.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.800
-Yeah.
-But because there's
no domestic relationship

19:03.833 --> 19:07.500
between you two and them two,
it's gonna be a simple battery.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.900
-Yeah.
-Okay? So, if you wanna
press charges against them,

19:10.933 --> 19:14.433
we can do that.
Okay? But at the same time,

19:14.467 --> 19:18.067
they can press charges
against you, and he said
he was tryin' to get you,

19:18.100 --> 19:20.700
and he accidentally hit Mom.
It is what it is.

19:20.733 --> 19:23.367
We can just call it a wash
and try to break
everything up.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.400
-I get hit by 300-pound man,
I'm used to it.
I mean, that-- (laughs)

19:26.433 --> 19:28.933
-Yeah, but I need you guys
to at least go down there,
and just fist bump 'em,

19:28.967 --> 19:30.333
tell 'em
everything's good to go.
-Yeah.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.200
-All right, come and let's do it
real quick. Here we go.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.700
So this is the thing.
Everything from tonight
is squashed.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.767
Fist bump, shake hands.
-Sorry.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.800
-I don't fist bump, I shake.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:41.933 --> 19:43.867
-Garcia:
Partners of the community here.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.200
You know, it could've been
a lot worse, but everybody's
gonna be good from tonight on,

19:47.233 --> 19:48.833
so... have a good night.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.500
Cover is code three.

19:55.533 --> 19:59.267
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.600 --> 20:08.367
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.333
-(theme music playing)
