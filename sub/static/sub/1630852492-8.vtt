- What?
- What?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.611
- I was really hoping you might
have some wisdom for me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.447
(knocking)

08:35.582 --> 08:37.214
- Oh hey, uh,
I gotta call you back,

08:37.251 --> 08:39.150
But basically, lionel's an
idiot, and you're doing great.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.618
I love you.
- Wait! Kate, I--

08:40.687 --> 08:42.620
(call beeps off)

08:44.191 --> 08:46.724
- Hey, sorry, you were in the
meeting earlier today, right?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.226
- Is the book really not
happening?

08:49.263 --> 08:51.829
- Oh, uh, where did you
hear that?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.731
- Well, is it or isn't it?

08:53.767 --> 08:56.567
- Uh, I'm-I'm sorry, we're
just trying to protect you.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.969
- (sighs) well, no offence,

08:58.005 --> 08:59.838
But we don't need
your protection.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.806
Plus, this isn't your decision
to make.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.008
- Right.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.544
(sighs)
hey, I know it sucks,

09:06.580 --> 09:08.380
But you're gonna have to trust
me on this one.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.680
If this book goes forward,

09:09.716 --> 09:11.649
You'd be the one paying
the price.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.718
- That's just it,
I've already paid the price.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.686
Do you have any idea how many
friends and family members

09:15.722 --> 09:17.655
I got wrapped up
in this nightmare?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.590
This is our chance
to stop people

09:19.626 --> 09:21.459
From making the same mistake
we did.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.562
And the only way we can do that
is if you publish this book.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.699
I-I really hope
you'll reconsider.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.103
You know what,
that's all I wanted to say.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.640

09:52.826 --> 09:54.592
- Change of plans.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.697
- I got here as soon
as I could.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.832
It was very brave of you
to call me.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.635
- Thanks for coming, val.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.503
- Of course.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.973
Now, tell me about your sex
problems.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.010
- I'm not having sex problems.
I'm having lionel problems.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.212
- Tomato, tomato.
- Seriously, val,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.714
I-I just feel like lionel's
angry at me all the time.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.616
- On account of the lack
of sex?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.917
- Jesus, val!

10:19.987 --> 10:21.820
- Listen, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.423
Every relationship hits this
all-too familiar road bump.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.393
Why do you think I bought these
unfamiliar road bumps?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.694
Hmm?

10:29.829 --> 10:31.729
- I'm not getting a new ass,
val.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.597
- Relax, you couldn't
handle it.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.132
I think it would look
forced on you.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.402
But there are other ways to
spice things up in the bedroom.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.072
(fabric rustles)

10:41.074 --> 10:44.208
- Please tell me that is not a-
- a sexy getup?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.710
You better believe it.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.012
Trust me, nothing wakes
a man's spirits

10:48.081 --> 10:49.848
Like a slutty firefighter

10:49.983 --> 10:52.217
Or a horny waitress,

10:52.352 --> 10:54.085
Or a naughty elderly
care worker.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.619
- Gross!

10:55.656 --> 10:58.022
- Anyway, while I sort of
admire your firm stance

10:58.091 --> 11:00.358
On not dressing
for the male gaze,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.427
I think you could veer away
from diane keaton chic

11:02.562 --> 11:03.961
For one night.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.764
- What's wrong with diane
keaton? She's a classy lady.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.432
- Oh, anne.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.767
For a therapist, sometimes
you really don't get it.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.105
This is the turnkey your
passion so desperately needs.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.707
- For the last time,
our "passion" is--

11:15.842 --> 11:17.675
- Just take it.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.778
I'll come back and get it
in a few days.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.313
- I thought it was a gift.
- Our gift.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.516
You ever heard of a timeshare?

11:24.651 --> 11:26.284
Toodles.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.319
(door opens and shuts)

11:28.388 --> 11:29.854
- She's like the mary poppins
of fucking.

(phones ring in the distance)

11:34.661 --> 11:36.160

11:37.197 --> 11:39.063

11:39.066 --> 11:40.732
Thank you.

- Nina? Everything okay?

11:43.670 --> 11:44.869
- Oh! Sorry.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.937
- Okay, all right.
Listen to me,

11:46.973 --> 11:48.806
Lesson number one,

11:48.942 --> 11:51.142
Never be the woman who cries
in front of her co-workers.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.211
It's a trope.
They'll think you're weak.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.079
- Oh god, you're probably
right, sorry.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.782
- Well.
- You're not gonna believe it.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.884
I convinced the board
to re-issue

12:00.019 --> 12:01.952
"the raccoon and the rock."

- Isn't that amazing?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.490
- How?
- Oh, I told them

12:05.625 --> 12:07.358
How incredibly moving it was.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.126
Hence the tears.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.262
Oh, the best part is they
want us to partner on it.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.097
- Excuse me?
- I know.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.301
Oh, I am so excited
to hear your thoughts.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.103
