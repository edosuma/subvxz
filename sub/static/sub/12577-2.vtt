There it is.

you aren't as in love as me and Marie.

27:54.274 --> 27:55.241
[Car alarm beeping]

27:56.442 --> 27:58.205
[Whales squealing on stereo]

27:58.444 --> 28:02.471
The whales sing of joy and sorrow,
of gain and loss...

28:03.449 --> 28:05.041
like LeAnn Rimes.

28:05.551 --> 28:06.984
[Moaning]

28:09.689 --> 28:11.281
Now, there,

28:11.391 --> 28:13.621
Now lie quietly for as long as you want,,,

28:13.726 --> 28:16.388
while l copy both sides
of your insurance card,

28:20.900 --> 28:22.299
[Snoring]

28:23.970 --> 28:27.337
Peggy's gonna have a hard time
replacing Doyle Harcavy.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.668
That guy's amazing.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.869
You look at his picture in the paper,
he never gets a day older.

28:31.978 --> 28:35.038
She has to mail in a sample column
this week.

28:35.348 --> 28:38.875
But she'll muse circles around him
if she can just get past her headaches.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.044
Those headaches are good as gone.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.816
Peggy went to John Redcorn for a healing.

28:43.923 --> 28:44.912
What?

28:45.024 --> 28:48.653
Don't worry, old John R will fix her up
just like he does for Nancy...

28:48.761 --> 28:50.490
three times a week.

28:50.663 --> 28:51.823
BlLL: Oh, Hank...

28:51.965 --> 28:56.834
l'm sure Peggy's headache
is nowhere near as serious as Nancy's.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.797
l tell you what, man.
You don't want to know.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.136
l can't even know what it is with you.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.038
Don't worry about Peggy.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.373
She does not have the same kind of...

29:07.180 --> 29:10.479
medical condition
that's causing Dale's wife...

29:10.583 --> 29:13.643
to suffer unduly. Where is she?

29:15.455 --> 29:16.422
[Exhaling]

29:21.828 --> 29:25.889
[Singing] Everything is beautiful
ln its own way

29:27.100 --> 29:28.362
Hi, Hank.

29:28.901 --> 29:32.200
Peggy, l guess dinner's gonna be
a little late tonight.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.530
[Peggy sighing]

29:33.873 --> 29:36.774
l just had a headache session
with John Redcorn.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.310
He lit some sweetgrass
and then l drifted off.

29:39.412 --> 29:42.540
The next thing l knew
l felt fan-freaking-tastic.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.308
Good. Your headache's gone.

29:45.418 --> 29:45.518
Then l guess you're all done
with John-freaking-Redcorn.

29:45.518 --> 29:48.510
Then l guess you're all done
with John-freaking-Redcorn.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.316
No, this is just the beginning.

29:50.423 --> 29:53.392
l have already scheduled
another treatment for next week.

29:53.493 --> 29:56.792
Peggy, l don't know how some guy
rubbing your neck helps your head.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.796
l mean, what's the connection?

29:59.298 --> 30:00.993
My reporter's instincts tell me...

30:01.100 --> 30:03.625
someone's a little grumpy
without his dinner.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.862
l just got my first musing:

30:06.973 --> 30:09.407
''My husband calls me his better half...

30:09.509 --> 30:12.808
''because l better half dinner
on the table when he gets home.''

30:13.012 --> 30:15.810
l'm gonna go write that up
while it's still fresh.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.511
-What's wrong, Uncle Hank?
-Nothing's wrong.

30:22.622 --> 30:26.149
lt's good news. Peggy had
her headache cured by John Redcorn.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.226
[Gasps]

30:27.360 --> 30:31.524
Stop that. Put your face back
the way it was before somebody sees you.

30:31.631 --> 30:34.327
-What's wrong, Luanne?
-Nothing's wrong, Bobby.

30:34.434 --> 30:37.460
Now go play outside.
Dinner's gonna be a little late.

30:37.570 --> 30:38.537
[Gasps]

30:43.910 --> 30:45.901
Hank, would you like a beer?

30:46.012 --> 30:48.742
This is not a social call, John Redcorn.

30:48.848 --> 30:52.682
l think l know why you're here.
Your wife came to me with a headache.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.309
A real headache,

30:54.420 --> 30:55.512
Her head actually hurt.

30:55.855 --> 30:59.621
l know that. But as l recall,
that's how it started with Nancy Gribble.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.386
Hank, you are my friend.

31:01.694 --> 31:05.721
l promise l would never heal your wife
the way l heal the wives of others.

31:05.832 --> 31:09.324
You better not. Because if you lay
one unprofessional hand on Peggy...

31:09.435 --> 31:11.266
l'm gonna kick your ass.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.070
[Wind blowing]

31:15.808 --> 31:16.934
l will.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.141
[Peggy and Nancy laughing]

31:19.312 --> 31:21.780
Oh, my Lord. Hank, l got it.

31:21.881 --> 31:25.146
-They are giving me the musings column.
-Thank God.

31:25.618 --> 31:28.678
You got the job. The pressure's off.
No more headaches, right?

31:28.788 --> 31:31.348
Are you kidding?
l have weekly deadlines now.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.051
l'll have to schedule
a regular night with John Redcorn.

31:34.160 --> 31:38.460
What? No. You don't need John Redcorn
to get rid of a headache.

31:38.698 --> 31:40.825
Here. l'll give you a massage.

31:41.501 --> 31:42.763
[Peggy wincing]

31:43.236 --> 31:45.227
Just let me know where you really need it.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.498
That's my kidneys.

31:46.606 --> 31:49.769
Breathe. Picture a wide-open field.

31:50.243 --> 31:52.211
Throw some birds in there if you want.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.246
Hank, stop it. You're just pinching,
slapping, and poking me.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.612
What is it that you have
against John Redcorn?

31:57.717 --> 32:01.414
Don't make me say it.
You know what he does to his clients.

32:01.654 --> 32:05.317
You think he's overcharging me?
For your information, l checked around.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.190
He is less expensive
than both VlP and Oriental Massage.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.788
For God sakes, Peggy, come on.

32:11.998 --> 32:15.434
lt's taken him 13 years
to cure Nancy's headache.

32:15.535 --> 32:16.866
So you're saying....

32:16.969 --> 32:19.733
What are you.... You're calling him a quack?

32:19.839 --> 32:22.000
You're saying his methods aren't effective?

32:22.108 --> 32:24.542
HANK: No. l'm saying they're very effective.

32:24.644 --> 32:26.874
Come on, you know what l'm talking about,

32:26.979 --> 32:30.107
Nancy. John Redcorn. Joseph.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.159
Good God!

32:46.766 --> 32:49.735
l just cannot believe
that l could be so stupid.

32:49.835 --> 32:53.362
How could you not tell me
what was going on in my own side yard?

32:53.472 --> 32:56.032
l thought you knew.
How could you not know?

32:56.142 --> 32:58.975
Look at Joseph.
Where do you think he came from?

32:59.078 --> 33:03.174
Nancy told me Dale had
a Jamaican grandmother. l believed her.

33:04.016 --> 33:07.474
Oh, my God. Dale. Does Dale know?

33:07.587 --> 33:10.055
No, he's as slow as you.

33:10.523 --> 33:13.754
ln a sweet, trusting sort of way.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.685
PEGGY: Shameless tramp.

33:16.796 --> 33:19.594
How can she? l just cannot believe.

33:19.899 --> 33:21.366
[Grunting]

33:21.500 --> 33:22.467
Ow.

33:25.338 --> 33:28.000
-You dirty bird.
-What's wrong, sug'?

33:28.107 --> 33:31.099
Joseph is not Jamaican.
And neither is Dale.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.702
And l am beginning to suspect
that his grandmother isn't either.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.082
So you know. Who told you?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.743
No one had to tell me.
How stupid do you think l am?

33:39.852 --> 33:42.980
You've been cheating for 12 years.
Nancy, how could you?

33:43.089 --> 33:44.249
l have my reasons.

33:44.357 --> 33:48.123
Yes, and l've seen those reasons
packed into his Sergio Valente jeans.

33:48.661 --> 33:51.152
l bet you don't even
have headaches anymore.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.028
PEGGY: And you!

33:56.235 --> 33:59.966
Dale Gribble is your friend.
How could you be a look-the-other-wayer?

34:00.072 --> 34:04.304
Now, Peggy, you're sort of freaked out
because it's still fresh for you.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.641
Live with it awhile.
You'll see, you'll get used to it.

34:07.747 --> 34:11.683
The only thing l ever want to get used to
is a cold glass of lemonade.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.685
l am still a journalist, darn it.

34:18.791 --> 34:19.757
[Sniffing]

34:19.958 --> 34:22.449
Did anyone else sniff today's garbage?

34:22.561 --> 34:25.530
And l thought
yesterday's garbage smelled good.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.860
Morning, Dale.

34:33.973 --> 34:35.600
You poor man.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.639
DALE: Hi, John Redcorn.
JOHN: Dale.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.475
Well, well, well.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.213
PEGGY: John Redcorn.
JOHN: Peggy.

34:48.688 --> 34:51.179
Nancy's headache's
very severe this morning.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.090
Must be the pollen.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.353
-Well, well, well.
-Well.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.292
[Over-pronouncing] John Redcorn.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.326
[Over-pronouncing] Peggy Hill.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.599
MlNH: Peggy Hill, what's so important
l have to jump off treadmill?

35:04.704 --> 35:07.798
l am so sorry, Minh,
but l had to talk to someone.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.806
lt's about Nancy.

35:11.077 --> 35:13.511
-She's having an affair.
-Oh, my God.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.706
-She's cheating on John Redcorn?
-You know about them?

35:16.916 --> 35:19.282
Not at first. lt took me about an hour.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.751
But l am naive and trusting person.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.256
-Peggy Hill, you not know?
-l knew.

35:25.491 --> 35:29.086
Peggy Hill not know. That is so funny.
Okay, who l tell?
