01:52.612 --> 01:53.446
Hi.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.244
I was just checking in to see
how you and your dad were doing.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.245
He's back.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.956
-Who's back?
-Tommy.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.041
He survived.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.044
Somehow, he dug himself out of the mines.
And now, he's back.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.963
-That's amazing.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.131
Oh.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.674
Is he...

02:13.675 --> 02:16.553
-How is he?
-Great. Doc Phibes checked him out.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.807
-Harvey, I'm so... happy and relieved.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.808
Me, too.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.979
I mean, I'll be even more so
when the shock wears off in a couple days.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.232
-Shock?
-Yeah.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.943
The collapse was a trauma,
and then being trapped down there,

02:32.026 --> 02:33.486
but it's typical, Doc Phibes says.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.239
He should be back to his old self,
eating and talking in no time.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.950
He's not talking?

02:43.121 --> 02:43.955
Is that him?

02:44.831 --> 02:45.665
Can I see him?

02:52.380 --> 02:54.716
Maybe not tonight.
Doc said he should rest for a bit.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.718
Yeah.

02:57.594 --> 03:02.015
But, Sabrina...
he's back, my brother is back.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.443
What do you think of my new duds,
Aunt Hilda?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.279
-Aww!
-For my first day at the academy tomorrow,

03:16.362 --> 03:18.823
I thought I'd go
for a little Carnaby Street cool.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.577
-Too much?
-Definitely not, no.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.121
You never get a second shot
at a first impression.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.249
Okay. So the stew's nearly ready.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.043
Will you lay the table
and round everyone up?

03:30.126 --> 03:33.338
Yeah. Uh, Sabrina went to Harvey's,

03:33.630 --> 03:36.341
and... Auntie Zee's been gone for ages.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.759
She has? That's odd.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.053
Where did she go, I wonder?

03:40.803 --> 03:41.638
Um-mm.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.310
If I'd known this style
of Satanic Confession was an option

03:47.393 --> 03:50.605
for Church of Night members,
I'd have taken it up years ago.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.692
I feel positively reborn in fire.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.693
Yes.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.739
Penance of the Flesh
is the purest form of worship.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.576
It offers us both punishment and pleasure.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.455
Though I do wish we could meet
someplace less... damp.

04:07.538 --> 04:12.210
Unfortunately,
we must keep our devotions... secret.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.172
Lady Blackwood is not as liberated
as I would like.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.758
I miss the old days.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.681
When all witches were polyamorous,
and monogamy was just for mortals.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.684
One of the False God's puritanical edicts.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.979
There is something to be said
about having a single partner

04:31.271 --> 04:36.567
with whom you explore
all the realms of agony and ecstasy.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.445
Zelda, as you know,

04:39.529 --> 04:42.991
nothing is more important to me
than the birth of my twin sons.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.619
Yet, more and more, I worry Lady Blackwood
is not the mother they'll need.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.500
Would you consider being
an unholy godmother to them?

04:55.795 --> 05:00.675
Yes, I would be honored
to be your boys' Night Mother.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.638
There is also the matter of
Lady Blackwood's classes at the academy.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.557
Would you take them over?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.726
She fatigues easily these days.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.062
And be the Satanic Choir's
interim director?

05:17.567 --> 05:18.526
It worked.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.238
Tommy's back home with Harvey,
who is so happy.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.073
And how is Tommy feeling himself?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.284
Fine.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.244
Does he have any sense
of what happened to him?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.581
-Unclear.
-Sabrina.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.292
I didn't really talk to Tommy,

05:34.375 --> 05:37.545
but apparently he's in shock,
which the doctor says is totally normal.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.340
Unless that doctor is a witch doctor,
I'd get a second opinion.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.052
I knew you shouldn't have performed that
resurrection. Everyone told you not to.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.387
Tommy will be back to himself
in a couple of days,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.181
he'll be talking, he'll be eating.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.432
He's not eating?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.852
Oh! We have to tell the aunties.

05:52.935 --> 05:53.978
We can't. You can't.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.356
They'll find out eventually.
This is a small town.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.733
A man coming back from the dead
is big news.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.526
He didn't come back from the dead.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.738
-He dug himself out of the mines.
-Hmm.

06:05.406 --> 06:08.493
And you're right, they will find out,
but by that time,

06:08.576 --> 06:12.205
Tommy will be back to normal,
and they'll be mad, yes,

06:12.288 --> 06:14.874
but they won't be able to undo anything.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.795
Please, Ambrose,
Harvey got his brother back.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.506
That's all that matters.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.719
O Mighty Dark Lord,
by whom all things are set afire,

06:26.803 --> 06:30.348
thy power be the path,
thy will be my desire.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.308
In hell as it is on earth.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.727
Praise Satan. Amen.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.900
Agatha... Agatha, what's the matter?

06:59.877 --> 07:02.255
Salem... what's going on?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.090
What's wrong?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.259
I think I make him nervous.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.971
Nicholas, what are you doing here?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.889
And how did you get into my room?

07:11.973 --> 07:12.932
I didn't.

07:16.727 --> 07:17.979
You're astral-projecting.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.402
Agatha's sick. Really sick.
Prudence says she's vomiting up dirt.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.904
What's that got to do with me?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.365
We killed her, buried her,
and brought her back to life.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.911
The fact that Agatha's coughing up
grave dirt can't be coincidence.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.373
-How's Tommy?
-He's fine.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.000
He's up and about.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.084
You're a terrible liar.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.128
-Has anyone ever told you that?
-You need to leave.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.973
You must really love that mortal boy,
to risk everything for him.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.058
What's his name again

07:56.142 --> 07:59.353
-Harvey. And, yes, I do.
-Oh.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.149
I hope he was appropriately grateful
for what you did.

08:05.943 --> 08:06.944
Oh, wow.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.155
He doesn't know.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.325
That's incredibly dangerous,
if it all goes south with his brother.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.242
Tommy's fine.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.787
Whatever's going on with Agatha will pass.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.914
You hope.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.462
I'll keep you posted.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.138
Salem, you need to go to Harvey's tonight

08:34.222 --> 08:35.556
-and keep watch.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.434
To make sure that everything's okay,
to make sure Harvey's safe.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.939
I'm sure it's all fine,
this is just a precaution, but go.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.032
Tommy?

09:00.456 --> 09:01.499
Tommy?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.091
Hey.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.221
You okay?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.474
Hey.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.616
What do you think
of looking through some pictures?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.952
Doc Phibes said that might help.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.538
Look.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.498
Um...

09:45.459 --> 09:47.503
That was the day Mom and Dad took us
to the carnival.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.756
I got lost in the Hall of Mirrors
and you came to rescue me.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.258
Remember how pissed Dad was?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.277
Yeah.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.155
Yeah, that's you.
You were an All-Star, dude.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.657
MVP. Three years straight.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.409
We'd all go to your games.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.882
I've never done anything like that before.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.885
You were born for this role.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.804
-I can't. What if I get--
-Caught?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.640
Then you run.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.479
If my dad ever found out,
I'd totally be grounded.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.648
Yeah?

10:49.273 --> 10:50.858
Susie, can I come in?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.026
Sure.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.157
Who were you talking to?

11:00.368 --> 11:01.369
No one, Dad.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.630
Spellman Sisters Mortuary,
how may I assist you?

11:13.881 --> 11:15.174
Oh, I see.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.051
Yes, yes.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.681
No, of course.
We'll take care of the poor dears.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.183
Thank you.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.395
Yes, Hilda?

11:27.770 --> 11:33.526
Well, it seems that most, if not all,
of the miners' bodies have been recovered.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.444
So they'll be arriving later today.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.821
And Satan willing,

11:36.904 --> 11:39.740
they'll bring some closure
to those young men's families.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.078
By the way, Sabrina,
how is Harvey coping with it all?

11:44.912 --> 11:46.122
He's hanging in there.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.874
Aunt Hilda, what time did you say
the bodies were arriving?

11:48.958 --> 11:53.045
Um... This afternoon.
I'm going to be at the bookstore.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.255
I can receive them.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.218
Uh, but do let me handle them, Aunt Zelda,
when I'm back from the academy.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.887
Which is where I'll be
later today as well.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.393
The High Priest has appointed me
Directrix of the Satanic Choir.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.811
Oh!

12:08.894 --> 12:10.104
When did he do that?

12:10.187 --> 12:11.522
Never you mind, Hilda.

12:12.481 --> 12:15.067
You stick to cleaning up
"spills on aisle five,"

12:15.151 --> 12:17.445
or whatever it is you do
in that tawdry little shop.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.531
In the meantime, Ambrose, Sabrina, and I

12:20.614 --> 12:24.201
will be restoring the luster
to the Spellman family name.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.870
Good things are coming.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.873
I can feel it in my bones.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.186
Did you feel it, too?

12:51.312 --> 12:52.646
Ms. Wardwell.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.317
-Feel what?
-The Santa Diabla.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.446
The ill wind
that blew through Greendale last night

13:00.529 --> 13:03.866
like a frisson of electricity.

13:05.242 --> 13:09.163
As though the curtain between worlds
had been torn asunder.

13:10.664 --> 13:11.791
You didn't feel it?

13:13.250 --> 13:14.418
I don't think so.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.462
I...

13:17.463 --> 13:19.548
I pretty much stayed in last night.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.675
Oh, but surely you heard the dogs?

13:22.384 --> 13:27.097
Why, it sounded like every dog
in Greendale was howling all night long.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.265
It was...

13:30.059 --> 13:31.393
exhilarating.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.021
Positively life-giving.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.856
Now you weren't thinking of...

13:36.565 --> 13:40.402
borrowing my Book of the Dead
without permission, were you?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.782
Not when all you need do is ask.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.494
Go on. Take it.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.627
Ms. Wardwell

14:00.089 --> 14:03.008
I picked up the wrong book.

14:03.717 --> 14:09.181
I was looking for...
the Occultist's Almanac.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.309
For some extra credit
I'm doing for Father Blackwood.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.103
Is it okay if I borrow it?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.112
Sabrina, is it true
what everyone's saying?

14:23.195 --> 14:24.655
That Harvey's brother is alive?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.240
People already know?

14:26.323 --> 14:29.368
Mr. Baterman was delivering a UPS package
across the street from Harvey's

14:29.451 --> 14:31.954
and said that he saw Tommy
through the window.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.581
Yeah, it's a miracle.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.624
Or the exact opposite.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.126
Why do you say that, Roz?

14:38.502 --> 14:42.089
I had the most bizarre dream last night.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.758
It was snowing.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.468
I was walking through the woods,

14:46.844 --> 14:49.847
and I heard this horrible sound.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.562
And I came through, into this clearing.

14:57.438 --> 15:02.234
And there were these dogs
fighting over...

15:04.320 --> 15:05.404
What, Roz?

15:05.946 --> 15:08.490
The dogs were tearing Tommy Kinkle apart.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.201
Roz, was this dream like...

15:12.995 --> 15:14.204
like the vision you had?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.166
Of the girls in the mine?

15:20.794 --> 15:22.546
Okay, Roz, real talk.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.964
I'm worried about Harvey

15:24.048 --> 15:27.051
and more specifically, I'm worried
that something might be wrong with Tommy.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.011
-Like what?
-I'm not sure yet.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.973
But maybe...
you could help us figure it out.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.310
How

15:36.393 --> 15:39.855
-I can't control the cunning.
-Are you sure about that?

15:40.230 --> 15:43.067
You saw the girls in the mine
when you touched Tommy's hard hat, right?

15:43.150 --> 15:46.528
Maybe, if-- if we could get you
close enough to Tommy--

15:46.612 --> 15:48.697
To, like, establish contact with him?

15:48.781 --> 15:52.952
You could see, immediately,
if something is wrong with him.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.082
How do you find our academy, then?

15:58.332 --> 15:59.416
Liberating.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.502
Absolutely liberating, Your Excellency.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.544
Mmm.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.838
I can well imagine.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.758
I have a gift for you.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.635
A token of brotherhood.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.222
You've been denied
a basic warlock right for too long.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.808
A familiar of your own.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.895
A goblin of the highest pedigree.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.691
His name...

16:24.566 --> 16:25.985
is Leviathan.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.910
Uh, thank you, Father Blackwood.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.453
You-- You honor me.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.375
These are exalted times
for the Church of Night, Ambrose.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.044
I can feel it.

16:44.545 --> 16:48.424
Your friend Lucas here has been helping me
with some plans to...

16:49.174 --> 16:51.552
reform... the coven.

16:52.302 --> 16:56.181
Its laws, its teachings,
the very foundation it is built upon.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.560
Anything I can do for you,
Your Excellency.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.729
Well, we'll see.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.357
In the meantime, perhaps you could start

17:05.441 --> 17:09.820
by helping Lucas translate
a nine-volume set of the Apostate Gospels

17:09.903 --> 17:12.072
he's been struggling with.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.575
-Certainly.
-I have my rounds.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.327
But feel free to, um...

17:17.661 --> 17:18.495
...spread out.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.832
Certainly.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.584
And Brother Ambrose...

17:26.295 --> 17:27.254
welcome home.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.728
Oh, Luke,

17:42.811 --> 17:46.482
-thank you... for making this possible.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.525
Don't thank me. It's Blackwood.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.527
-He sees something inside you.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.863
-Where is the High Priest?

17:53.947 --> 17:55.365
Doing his rounds.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.035
Maybe you can help, then.
You are a Spellman, after all.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.370
What's the problem?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.581
-Our sister Agatha is sick.
-Vomiting soil.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.875
Spellman soil
from that so-called Cain Pit.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.210
You saw us that night, Spellman.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.046
We did everything to the letter,
and Thomas Kinkle is back and fine.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.633
So why is Agatha coughing up
dirt and turnips?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.929
Not a clue.
And who told you Tommy is fine?

18:17.012 --> 18:17.846
Sabrina.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.892
-Isn't he?
-I believe the jury's still out on that.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.728
I don't care about the mortal,
I care about my sister.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.189
We brought her back to life
on your property,

18:27.272 --> 18:30.859
and now something's gone terribly wrong.
So you're going to help us fix it.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.029
When it comes to matters of the Cain Pit,
I'm no expert, but...

18:34.822 --> 18:36.115
I do know someone who is.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.207
Here you go, lovey.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.304
Well, well, well.
What do you know?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.098
It's the little dyke girl.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.432
Been a while. What's up?

19:02.516 --> 19:04.059
Yeah, what are you up to?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.854
-Nothing. Shopping.
-What do you got under your shirt?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.648
I mean, definitely not boobs,
but you got something.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.109
-Hey, let's see.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.612
Excuse me -

19:16.405 --> 19:18.740
I'll thank you
to keep your hands to yourself.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.284
She started it.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.744
Uh-mmm. No, she didn't, Billy Marlin.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.455
You know my name?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.167
Yeah.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.419
I know everything about you, Billy.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.714
And I know why you're a bully.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.217
And it's terrible, what happened to you

19:37.301 --> 19:39.094
at that summer camp
when you were 11 years old.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.765
It is awful what those boys did to you,
how none of your counselors believed you,

19:43.849 --> 19:46.268
how your dad didn't either, how your
mother washed your mouth out

19:46.351 --> 19:48.729
with detergent until you just
stopped talking.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.607
Doesn't give you the right
to harass anybody,

19:51.940 --> 19:53.650
especially someone
much smaller than you.

19:53.734 --> 19:58.030
So, why don't you and your chum,
who's in lust with you, by the way...

19:59.114 --> 20:01.783
leave my store before I start
telling everyone what happened.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.285
Come on. Let's go.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.579
Crack on.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.582
Don't let the door hit you
on your way out.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.835
You okay?

20:12.336 --> 20:13.795
Yeah, thanks.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.965
You're Sabrina's friend, right

20:18.800 --> 20:20.886
What have you got there

20:21.094 --> 20:23.013
I could treat you to it, if you want.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.932
Don't go! I-- Mmm.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.314
Ginnie Woolf.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.691
She could throw a dinner party.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.492
Dr. Cerberus' Books and Spirits,
how may I assist you?

20:46.286 --> 20:47.496
It started last night.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.666
Oh, I see. Yeah.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.591
Well... the Cain Pit
is a miracle, really...

21:00.175 --> 21:02.678
but if you come back too soon,
you'll make yourself ill.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.890
It's a form of decompression sickness,
like when divers get the bends.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.477
Do it too fast and you're gonna vomit up
half the cemetery.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.895
What do we do?

21:12.729 --> 21:17.359
Well, I reckon she has too much earth
in her system,

21:17.693 --> 21:20.195
so we need to rebalance her elements.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.991
So, I suggest a tonic of fizzy water,
which will give her water and air.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.868
And a dash of cayenne pepper for fire.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.371
Three times a day, for a week.
She'll be right as rain.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.249
That's it?

21:32.332 --> 21:33.625
Fizzy water?

21:33.709 --> 21:37.087
Oh, but you'll serve it with love,
won't you, darling?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.552
Not to question you, auntie,

21:43.635 --> 21:46.346
but you just prescribed Alka-Seltzer
to a girl who came back from the dead.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.932
There's something to be said
for keeping them busy.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.811
Ambrose, the dirt that she's coughing up
is practically gravel,

21:53.478 --> 21:56.481
which tells me that Agatha shouldn't have
been brought back in the first place.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.570
The earth is owed a soul,
it means to collect.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.449
So, nephew, pray, tell me.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.618
What was Agatha doing in the Cain Pit
in the first place?

22:20.464 --> 22:22.549
-Tommy?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.179
-He won't answer you.
-How's he doing?

22:28.847 --> 22:29.931
I'll show you.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.685
Watch.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.146
Oh, my God!

22:38.231 --> 22:42.152
At first,
I thought he was getting better.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.820
That he was remembering.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.157
That's all he'll do.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.119
React, like a robot.

22:53.955 --> 22:54.790
Harvey...

22:55.457 --> 22:56.917
uh, where's your dad?

22:57.167 --> 22:59.753
At the mines. He's already trying
to get it back up and running,

22:59.836 --> 23:01.505
but he could be home at any minute.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.965
Has Tommy eaten anything yet?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.801
Not yet. Just water.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.930
Do you have any soup?

23:10.013 --> 23:12.099
-I think we do.
-That might be a way to get him to eat.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.767
Lemme try that. I'll be right back.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.564
Roz, do you see anything?

24:04.401 --> 24:06.319
Any sign of Tommy

24:09.990 --> 24:12.701
What happened - Um...

24:13.410 --> 24:14.244
I'm not sure.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.246
What did you see

24:16.329 --> 24:18.248
I saw Tommy.

24:19.207 --> 24:24.004
Uh, he was lost in the woods
and there was a fog.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.007
He was confused.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.633
Was anyone else with him?

24:29.885 --> 24:30.719
No.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.096
No, he was alone.

24:34.681 --> 24:38.727
But, uh... I heard a baby crying.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
A baby?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.860
What's going on here?

24:47.360 --> 24:48.445
Where's Harvey?

24:48.528 --> 24:51.740
The kitchen, Mr. Kinkle, we just came by
to check in on Harvey and Tommy.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.408
Dad, they were helping.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.952
Like they know more than Doc Phibes?

24:58.914 --> 25:01.082
-We'll talk to you later, Harvey.
-Yeah, okay.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.430
I don't understand
what the crying baby means.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.015
Yeah, me, neither.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.935
Roz, are you okay?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.063
Did you see something
that you're not telling me?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.189
No.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.316
Just what I said.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.405
What happened
after the boys surprised you?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.034
Ms. Spellman surprised them.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.746
And started saying things.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.122
Secret things.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.500
But they were true.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.379
And the boys got scared and ran off.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.506
Spellman.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.759
Yeah, my-- my friend Sabrina's aunt.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.848
Tell me, are they still witches...

25:59.891 --> 26:01.017
the Spellmans?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.069
Ambrose, I figured it out.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.363
It's something called "soul separation."

26:13.446 --> 26:16.241
We brought back Tommy's body,
but not his soul.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.325
It's trapped in--

26:18.285 --> 26:19.494
Ambrose is in the basement,

26:20.161 --> 26:23.790
tending to the corpses,
which have started to smell rather ripely.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.710
-Auntie Hilda, I can explain everything.
-Um-mmm.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.462
No, your cousin already did that,
in great detail.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.299
You lied to me.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.052
You did the one thing
I told you not to do.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.346
Incorrectly to boot.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.849
I couldn't bear
to see Harvey suffer like that,

26:40.932 --> 26:43.643
and I think
I can fix this entire situation.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.646
I just have to put Tommy's soul
back in his body.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.647
It's too late.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.358
No, it's not.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.029
Roz said she had a vision
of Tommy lost in foggy woods,

26:54.112 --> 26:56.156
and that she heard a baby crying.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.616
That's limbo.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.159
Tommy's in limbo.

26:59.242 --> 27:02.412
It's where the souls
of unbaptized babies go when they perish,

27:02.495 --> 27:05.081
or the souls of people
who died before their time.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.584
I just need to get there...

27:08.460 --> 27:10.211
and retrieve Tommy's soul.

27:11.838 --> 27:12.839
Will you help me?

27:13.965 --> 27:16.968
First of all, may I say,
there are two limbos, Sabrina.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.388
One for witches, one for mortals.
Tommy Kinkle is in mortal limbo.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.433
And it is simply impossible for witches
to cross over into mortal limbo.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.810
But I'm not a witch, I'm a half-witch,

27:25.894 --> 27:28.563
-which means I can cross over.
-You're assuming?

27:29.439 --> 27:32.359
Because meanwhile,
the witch that you killed...

27:33.526 --> 27:36.571
and brought back to life
is getting sicker and sicker.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.659
That's the Grim Reaper doing it to her.
He's expecting a body.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.370
Her suffering won't end
until there's one in the ground,

27:43.453 --> 27:45.372
until balance is restored.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.123
There's no fixing it, Sabrina.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.500
You've opened Pandora's box.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.584
Guys.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.171
There's something you need to see.
In the embalming room.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.379
Help me.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.640
How did Agatha end up a living cadaver?

28:47.350 --> 28:49.561
Tell me everything, at once.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.814
It's all Sabrina's doing, Father.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.527
She wanted to resurrect a mortal
that was crushed in the mine collapse.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.238
Sabrina performed a resurrection?

29:00.321 --> 29:01.698
With a Book of the Dead.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.201
She slit Agatha's throat
as part of the ritual...

29:05.869 --> 29:07.537
to bring the Kinkle boy back.

29:07.996 --> 29:12.876
And then brought Agatha back to life
in a Cain Pit in the Spellman's yard.

29:12.959 --> 29:16.296
But something's gone wrong.
The boy is alive.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.006
Thomas Kinkle is alive?

29:18.214 --> 29:20.008
But Agatha's getting sicker and sicker.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.344
Your Excellency,
I knew nothing of this, I swear it.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.804
-But I can--
-You can what?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.057
Control Sabrina No.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.686
You've proven, time and again,
that you cannot.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.400
the Infernal Infirmary.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.278
I'll make short work
of the resurrected boy,

29:40.779 --> 29:45.033
restore the balance,
clean up this bloody mess.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.285
Please, Father, allow me.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.997
Sabrina is my niece, my responsibility.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.249
Her transgression is mine.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.377
Whatever she did, I will undo.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.465
Give me a chance to make things right.
I will not fail you again.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.010
Do it, then.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.095
Thank you.

30:09.724 --> 30:10.642
That wound.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.685
And that one.

30:13.853 --> 30:14.979
Those are bite marks.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.983
These... teeth, they're--

30:19.067 --> 30:20.068
Human.

30:20.151 --> 30:24.489
Yep. Taking a guess, I think,
that's why Tommy hasn't eaten.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.408
He isn't hungry. Yet.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.412
Harvey.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.957
What are you doing here?

30:34.040 --> 30:37.961
I've got a question for you.
Why don't you tell me who you are?

30:38.461 --> 30:40.505
-Come on, Dad, you're drunk.
-The hell I am.

30:40.588 --> 30:41.673
Yeah, you are!

30:42.382 --> 30:46.553
You've been drinking since the accident,
but you can stop now. Tommy's back.

30:48.972 --> 30:53.226
You believe that

30:53.810 --> 30:54.936
Don't call him that.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.813
That's what he is.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.439
Get out of here.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.732
A damn zombie.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.447
-Snap out of it, for pity's sake.
-Dad, back off.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.450
You in there -Dad! Leave Tommy alone!

31:10.243 --> 31:12.829
I would, except this thing ain't Tommy.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.875
I don't know what the hell it is,
but it ain't my son.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.669
And if you are...

31:20.920 --> 31:23.006
you might as well have stayed
in the mines.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.007
Hey!

31:25.091 --> 31:27.302
-You piece of shit.

31:30.805 --> 31:34.559
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, no!
Stop it! Tommy-- Tommy, stop it!

31:34.642 --> 31:36.853
-Tommy, stop! Tommy!

31:36.936 --> 31:38.855
-Tommy! Tommy!

31:42.567 --> 31:43.693
Mr. Kinkle!

31:43.776 --> 31:46.613
Don't go in there.
He's an animal! He's not my son.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.241
Harvey?

31:53.995 --> 31:55.121
What happened?

31:55.204 --> 31:56.998
My dad punched me

31:57.081 --> 31:59.375
-and then Tommy tried to kill him.
-What

31:59.459 --> 32:01.794
Yeah, I'm fine,
I'm just trying to get him calmed down.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.423
Maybe he's thirsty. Here.
Give him some of this.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.807
That's the only time Tommy looks normal.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.477
When he's asleep.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.480
Harvey, Tommy will get better.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.608
Just like the doctor said,
he's... in shock.

32:23.691 --> 32:24.525
No.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.320
Something's wrong with him, 'Brina.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.530
And I know, all I should be is grateful.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.699
And I am, but...

32:32.742 --> 32:35.078
in the back of my mind,
I keep wondering...

32:36.663 --> 32:38.164
how did Tommy get out?

32:39.749 --> 32:41.042
How did he survive?

32:41.918 --> 32:44.587
You saw his hard hat.
It was covered in blood.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.590
He was under all that rock...

32:48.758 --> 32:50.510
and not a single broken bone?

32:52.762 --> 32:53.846
Hey, you'll...

32:55.473 --> 32:56.933
We'll get through this.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.478
Trust me.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.230
It's not over.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.525
Sabrina--

33:05.858 --> 33:07.360
But you have to be careful.

33:09.195 --> 33:12.657
Tommy's asleep now.
I bet he'll sleep through the night.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.785
But if he doesn't,
and he tries to hurt you,

33:16.119 --> 33:17.245
you have to run.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.375
Harvey...

33:23.710 --> 33:24.836
do you promise?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.804
Aunties?

33:35.638 --> 33:36.681
Are you here? I need--

33:36.764 --> 33:39.517
I frankly don't care
what you need, Sabrina.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.478
But I'll tell you what I need.
An explanation.

33:42.562 --> 33:47.442
For why a Spellman was practicing
necromancy on a mortal boy in Greendale.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.901
She knows everything, love.

33:49.277 --> 33:54.490
And why, in Satan's name, she would drag
other witches into her reckless,

33:54.574 --> 33:55.825
stupid, selfish plans?

33:55.908 --> 33:57.452
I did it for Harvey.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.872
Did you

34:00.955 --> 34:05.334
No, because no one in their right mind
would do what you did.

34:05.585 --> 34:08.254
How did you even know what spell to use?

34:08.629 --> 34:11.257
-Ambrose says he didn't give it to you.
-I didn't.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.052
Ms. Wardwell.

34:15.553 --> 34:20.224
-She gave it to you?
-No. No, I... took a book from her office.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.269
Oh, so you're a thief,
as well as a murderer.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.147
Murderer

34:26.230 --> 34:27.482
Just for a few minutes.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.903
This is not a joke, Sabrina.
You've thrown off the balance.

34:31.986 --> 34:35.364
Not me, Agatha and Dorcas.
They killed Tommy.

34:35.698 --> 34:38.117
This wasn't some natural disaster.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.495
I was undoing what witches did.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.955
All you did was make things worse.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.375
I'm going to fix this,
I am going to save Tommy.

34:46.459 --> 34:50.338
Fix what? There's nothing to fix,
and he can't be saved.

34:50.630 --> 34:54.550
It's done, Sabrina. He belongs
in the ground and that's where he's going.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.096
Not if I pass over into mortal limbo
and bring his soul back.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.473
I'm half-mortal, I can go there.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.892
If you what?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.686
I just need someone to anchor me here
on the physical plane.

35:06.562 --> 35:12.110
Sabrina... I have just spent the very last
of my credibility with the High Priest...

35:12.735 --> 35:13.611
begging,

35:13.694 --> 35:18.116
begging him to let us clean up your mess,
to take care of this atrocity ourselves,

35:18.199 --> 35:21.202
to save our family
in the eyes of the coven.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.831
We're standing in a grave, young lady,
all of us, and you want to dig it deeper?

35:24.914 --> 35:27.125
I don't care about the High Priest,
Aunt Zee.

35:27.208 --> 35:31.129
I care about what's right.
And about Harvey. And his brother.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.005
I'm going to cross over.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.008
You're not capable of the magic
required to cross the barrier.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.969
You don't know what I'm capable of.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.388
You're a 16-year-old child,
not some grand magus!

35:40.471 --> 35:44.058
And you're not my mother, Zelda,
so stop acting like you are!

35:44.142 --> 35:47.937
Oy! You do not speak
to your Aunt Zelda like that. Not ever!

35:50.148 --> 35:52.316
It's fine, Hilda. You heard her.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.611
She's not a child, and I'm not her mother.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.907
She's a grown-up witch now,
and it's time she learned how the world,

35:59.991 --> 36:02.952
the realms, really work.

36:03.035 --> 36:06.497
Everything has a price.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.001
Edward learned that lesson.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.628
I learned it.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.088
It's your turn now.

36:15.089 --> 36:19.051
Try to save this mortal,
even if it rips the membrane to pieces.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.471
But don't pretend
it's not for selfish reasons.

36:22.555 --> 36:27.101
And don't come crying to me
when it all blows up in your face.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.752
No one will help you,
just as Aunt Zee says.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.754
You're wrong, Ambrose.

36:56.005 --> 36:56.964
There's someone.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.107
I need your help, Ms. Wardwell.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.585
I'm sorry I lied...

37:35.503 --> 37:39.257
and I'm sorry I stole
the Book of the Dead from your office...

37:39.966 --> 37:41.926
but I'm not sorry for what I did.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.011
I mean,

37:44.095 --> 37:49.809
how could I sit by and watch Harvey suffer
without trying to do something?

37:50.017 --> 37:51.185
I understand.

37:52.937 --> 37:59.610
We've all done... unspeakable things
to help the ones we love.

38:01.487 --> 38:02.530
But, Sabrina...

38:03.030 --> 38:07.743
limbo, mortal or witch,
is a realm at the edge of death.

38:08.035 --> 38:13.165
The souls trapped there are lost
in ways we can't understand.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.585
Hunted by a monstrosity, a...

38:17.753 --> 38:19.505
Soul-Eater that...

38:21.007 --> 38:23.301
devours those it catches.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.305
Are you certain you want to take the risk
in going there?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.520
Harvey would do it for me in a heartbeat.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.611
In that case, I... I know a threshold.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.990
A portal, deep in the woods.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.329
But we'll have to tread lightly
and quickly, Sabrina.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.875
The very slightest mistake...

38:56.876 --> 38:58.711
could spell disaster for you...

39:00.212 --> 39:02.173
and poor Mr. Kinkle's brother.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.453
Zelds?

39:35.581 --> 39:37.750
No! No, no, no, no, no!

39:37.833 --> 39:38.751
Stop it!

39:38.834 --> 39:40.669
No, no, no, no, no, no!

39:40.753 --> 39:43.381
-Zee, why would you do that to yourself?

39:44.131 --> 39:45.966
-There we go.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.385
There we go.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.349
-We were wrong.
-What?

39:54.809 --> 39:56.268
All those years ago.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.690
We should never have taken Sabrina in.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.403
We should've let Diana's family have her.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.157
It was my arrogance.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.702
To think I could raise her. Guide her.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.874
But she looked so much like Edward.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.292
Remember?

40:22.753 --> 40:24.547
I couldn't say no.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.967
I could never say no to Sabrina.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.595
-Zelda...

40:32.388 --> 40:35.307
...you always say no to Sabrina.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.186
She just doesn't listen to you.

40:40.521 --> 40:41.605
Come on, now.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.524
Come on.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.734
Let's have enough of that.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.822
Prudence, Dorcas, heed me.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.367
The returned boy is a soulless husk.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.288
Every moment he draws air,
he risks exposing the Church of Night

40:57.371 --> 40:58.414
and our magics.

40:58.497 --> 40:59.707
Despite Zelda's promise,

40:59.790 --> 41:02.293
the Spellmans are too recalcitrant
to be trusted

41:02.376 --> 41:05.713
with bringing this situation
to a satisfactory conclusion.

41:06.005 --> 41:10.801
But you, girls, had a hand
in his reanimation.

41:10.885 --> 41:15.097
You will put an end to Thomas Kinkle.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.392
And be quick about it.

41:25.691 --> 41:28.152
Perhaps I'll tear out his heart,
give it to Agatha

41:28.235 --> 41:31.447
after the trouble he's put her through?
Or we could place his head on a spike.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.450
You heard what my father said, Dorcas.
Let's just get this done.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.584
What's happening

41:43.667 --> 41:45.669
-I don't know.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.963
My apologies, ladies.

41:48.088 --> 41:50.549
Nicholas! What have you done to us?

41:50.633 --> 41:52.092
It's an old catching spell.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.969
Drive a spike through a witch's footprint

41:54.053 --> 41:56.680
and she'll be rooted to the spot
until you pull up the spike.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.391
Why are you doing this?
My father gave us orders.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.936
The Spellmans are handling this, Prudence.

42:02.603 --> 42:06.732
And you, Dorcas, and I are staying
right here until they're finished.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.706
Not so fast.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.292
Give me your wrist.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.462
So I don't lose track of you.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.839
Tug on it three times
when you're heading back,

42:30.923 --> 42:32.883
and I'll open the portal on this side.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.260
Understand?

42:35.219 --> 42:37.429
Thank you, Ms. Wardwell.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.514
Well...

42:39.056 --> 42:40.641
Not at all, Sabrina.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.227
Now...

42:44.144 --> 42:45.396
recite the words.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.367
Redi ad periculum tuum.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.855
I'll be waiting right here for you.

44:15.694 --> 44:16.820
Tommy?

44:22.034 --> 44:23.160
Tommy?

45:00.072 --> 45:02.491
Mom

45:04.076 --> 45:05.369
Who are you?

45:06.495 --> 45:08.956
Mom, it's me. Sabrina.

45:09.748 --> 45:10.874
Sabrina?

45:11.542 --> 45:12.376
No.

45:13.877 --> 45:17.214
No, Sabrina was my baby.
And she was baptized.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.843
Only... unbaptized babies go to limbo.

45:21.927 --> 45:24.179
Mom, I promise you, it's me.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.683
But they took her.

45:29.351 --> 45:31.854
They took my baby after the baptism.

45:32.271 --> 45:33.355
Who did?

45:34.732 --> 45:36.650
Are you okay?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.068
The witches are coming.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.489
-What's that?
-The Soul-Eater.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.658
-Don't let him get you.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.243
Save yourself!

46:07.723 --> 46:09.391
-Sabrina?

46:09.475 --> 46:11.977
Tommy! Tommy, we have to go.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.479
Where are we? I was in the mines--

46:13.562 --> 46:16.482
Tommy, everything is gonna be all right,
but we have to go.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.358
-No!

46:18.442 --> 46:19.735
We have to run!

46:28.035 --> 46:29.369
Ms. Wardwell!

46:30.496 --> 46:31.538
I've got Tommy!

46:35.334 --> 46:36.668
Open the portal!

46:49.890 --> 46:54.686
Hear me, Spirits of the Dead,
and reveal the portal!

46:54.770 --> 46:58.232
Help me to pass through
with this brave mortal!

47:12.663 --> 47:13.664
Sabrina, what--

47:14.790 --> 47:16.458
No! No!

47:17.042 --> 47:19.044
No. No. No.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.131
Ms. Wardwell,
I have to go back in there.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.092
I found Tommy once, I can find him again.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.510
Sabrina, you can't.

47:28.095 --> 47:32.391
From what we just saw,
it seems the Soul-Eater's gotten him.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.686
What does that mean?

47:38.397 --> 47:39.815
You know what it means.

47:48.907 --> 47:51.493
But I promised Harvey I'd fix this.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.209
But you still can.

48:01.169 --> 48:06.008
Painful... but there's one path left
for you to follow.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.305
But if I tell him...

48:12.973 --> 48:15.183
If your love is true...

48:17.019 --> 48:18.270
he'll understand.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.461
Well, Stolas.

48:44.254 --> 48:48.300
It took longer than I
or the Dark Lord might have liked, but...

48:49.635 --> 48:51.887
finally it's about to happen.

48:54.056 --> 48:59.311
Sabrina's primary tie to the mortal world,
Harvey Kinkle...

49:01.063 --> 49:02.648
is about to be severed.

49:04.232 --> 49:06.610
And Satan be praised.

49:08.528 --> 49:10.364
She'll have no one to blame...

49:11.823 --> 49:13.367
-but herself.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.536
Yes, Stolas...

49:17.496 --> 49:20.248
we should go check on her chums, too.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.251
Susie, um...

49:23.961 --> 49:26.004
you remember when we went
to see my Nana Ruth?

49:26.088 --> 49:27.172
Of course.

49:27.255 --> 49:30.008
-She called me a handsome fellow.

49:30.092 --> 49:36.890
Yeah, and she said all that weird stuff
about the cunning and how it's like ESP.

49:36.974 --> 49:40.852
How witches cursed the Walker family and
that's why so many of us have gone blind.

49:40.936 --> 49:41.853
Yeah.

49:43.438 --> 49:45.357
Susie, I think it may be true.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.234
All of it.

49:50.612 --> 49:53.991
I can see things,
things I shouldn't be able to.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.283
Like ghosts?

49:56.827 --> 49:59.746
More like... visions.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.666
And secrets.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.751
About people.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.005
What kind of secrets

50:08.088 --> 50:10.716
No. Like about Sabrina.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.553
She's been hiding something from us.

50:14.636 --> 50:17.055
Something really, really big.

50:17.931 --> 50:20.308
-I think I may know.
-I think Sabrina might be a witch.

50:22.853 --> 50:26.398
And I know...
I know how crazy that sounds.

50:26.481 --> 50:29.026
-That our best friend might be--
-I think all the Spellmans are.

50:31.611 --> 50:33.989
My Aunt Dorothea wrote about them
in her journals.

50:34.072 --> 50:37.492
So you believe me

50:37.576 --> 50:39.619
I think Greendale's
a pretty weird town, Roz.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.705
I'm starting to believe
anything is possible.

50:41.788 --> 50:42.998
Agreed.

50:45.375 --> 50:48.837
But what does it mean to be a witch?

50:49.296 --> 50:50.130
Uh...

50:50.380 --> 50:53.759
Like, is Sabrina evil?

50:54.092 --> 50:55.552
Or dangerous?

50:55.635 --> 50:56.845
I don't know.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.110
Where's your dad?

51:13.779 --> 51:15.864
Um... at the bar.

51:17.908 --> 51:18.784
How's Tommy?

51:21.119 --> 51:22.120
The same.

51:22.788 --> 51:23.872
Still sleeping.

51:28.168 --> 51:31.338
Harvey, I have something to tell you.

51:33.840 --> 51:37.260
Something I can't hide from you anymore.

51:41.723 --> 51:42.557
What is it?

51:44.226 --> 51:46.186
I'm ready for just about anything
at this point.

51:47.687 --> 51:54.236
Tommy's asleep because I gave him
a few drops of sleep potion.

51:57.072 --> 51:58.448
What do you mean potion?

51:59.658 --> 52:02.077
It was mixed in with the water
I brought with me.

52:03.161 --> 52:07.833
And... the reason Tommy came back...

52:08.416 --> 52:09.709
is because...

52:11.336 --> 52:12.254
I...

52:13.672 --> 52:15.841
performed a ritual to bring him back.

52:19.010 --> 52:21.763
Sabrina, what are you talking about?

52:27.185 --> 52:29.271
I'm a witch, Harvey.

52:34.693 --> 52:35.569
You've...

52:36.444 --> 52:37.946
You've told me this before.

52:39.197 --> 52:41.199
Just before my 16th birthday.

52:42.492 --> 52:45.036
But then... I made you forget...

52:47.455 --> 52:48.623
with a spell.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.377
How can I believe you? How can I...

52:53.378 --> 52:54.671
How can I believe this?

52:54.754 --> 52:57.966
When you were eight,
you saw a demon in the mines.

52:58.300 --> 53:01.386
You knew Jesse Putnam was possessed
before anyone else did.

53:04.222 --> 53:07.100
You come from a family of witch hunters.

53:12.814 --> 53:14.399
And your brother...

53:16.067 --> 53:17.861
What

53:22.908 --> 53:24.409
That's not really him...

53:26.953 --> 53:30.081
in Tommy's room, in Tommy's bed.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.042
-Of course it is.
-No.

53:32.250 --> 53:33.460
No, I...

53:35.712 --> 53:39.674
I performed a... resurrection spell...

53:41.009 --> 53:42.219
to help Tommy...

53:43.762 --> 53:44.679
and you, too.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.431
Because...

53:47.515 --> 53:50.352
Because I knew
you would do the same for me.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.939
But it all went wrong.

53:58.526 --> 54:00.904
I brought back Tommy's body,

54:00.987 --> 54:04.908
but not his soul...
not the part of him that's really Tommy.

54:05.742 --> 54:08.078
What are you talking about? That is Tommy.

54:08.161 --> 54:09.287
No, Harvey...

54:10.956 --> 54:11.998
it's not.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.292
You know it's not.

54:16.962 --> 54:18.672
If that's not Tommy, then who...

54:19.214 --> 54:20.048
what is it?

54:20.131 --> 54:21.383
Something else.

54:22.008 --> 54:25.136
Something I need...

54:26.054 --> 54:27.013
to put back

54:27.597 --> 54:28.473
in the ground...

54:28.974 --> 54:31.935
...before things get worse.

54:33.478 --> 54:36.648
-Why, Sabrina, why did you--
-I wanted to fix this for you.

54:38.441 --> 54:40.068
I wanted you to stop hurting.

54:40.318 --> 54:43.655
You shouldn't have done anything.
You should've left Tommy where he was.

54:43.738 --> 54:45.282
That's why I need to make this right.

54:47.701 --> 54:52.747
That's why I need to put
what's in Tommy's room... back.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.457
Back where? What do you...

55:00.630 --> 55:02.799
-Sabrina...
-I have to.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.636
It's the only way.

55:15.687 --> 55:17.355
Will it... Will it hurt him?

55:18.898 --> 55:19.774
No.

55:22.986 --> 55:26.906
No, I don't think he feels things
like we do.

55:29.451 --> 55:30.285
How?

55:30.827 --> 55:32.078
How are you gonna do it?

55:33.997 --> 55:34.873
I...

55:35.874 --> 55:37.959
could...

55:38.460 --> 55:39.753
I don't even know.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.548
-I'll do it.
-No!

55:43.631 --> 55:46.134
No, Harvey, you don't-- you--

55:46.217 --> 55:48.511
-You shouldn't--
-He's my brother, Sabrina, and I...

55:50.597 --> 55:53.224
I don't want you to be the person
that did that to any part of Tommy.

55:53.308 --> 55:54.893
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

55:54.976 --> 55:57.228
You-- You have to go.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.691
Why? I don't want to.

56:01.775 --> 56:02.650
So I can...

56:03.068 --> 56:05.278
do this before my dad gets back,
before I...

56:07.155 --> 56:09.199
before I chicken out. And I...

56:10.950 --> 56:11.868
And I...

56:12.786 --> 56:14.245
I can't talk to you again...

56:15.872 --> 56:16.956
for a while.

56:17.040 --> 56:20.585
Harvey... Harvey, please, let me stay.
Let me at least help.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.170
No, Sabrina, you've...

56:24.464 --> 56:25.590
you've done enough.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.769
Is it done, then?

58:39.474 --> 58:42.227
It's over, Aunt Zelda.

58:42.894 --> 58:46.564
Tommy's gone... ...and Harvey and I...

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:18.114
Brett, move your head.
