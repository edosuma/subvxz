00:50.572 --> 00:53.053
I've been on this
case for several months now.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.882
The mayor himself's got me
working day and night on this.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.841
Shit.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.620
I could have just
stayed in the military

01:01.645 --> 01:03.445
if I wanted to be cold
and tired all the time.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.937
Can't say I blame the
mayor for his concern.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.852
I've met some pretty
dangerous men in my time,

01:09.895 --> 01:11.375
but this guy, Harry Archibald,

01:12.898 --> 01:14.422
he really gives me the creeps.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.860
I've got a bad feeling,

01:17.903 --> 01:19.703
you know that thing in
your gut that tells you

01:19.728 --> 01:21.690
when something bad's
about to go down,

01:21.733 --> 01:23.126
and I'm already in too deep.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.043
Nottingham's most
powerful men meeting

01:27.087 --> 01:28.262
in the shadows at night.

01:29.915 --> 01:33.745
I don't know, maybe I'm
just being paranoid.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.544
Harry, I'd appreciate it

01:49.587 --> 01:52.242
if you didn't call my home
in the middle of the night.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.898
What's going on, Harry?

01:55.941 --> 01:58.335
What in God's name
are we doing here?

01:58.379 --> 01:59.771
What's so bloody urgent?

02:05.081 --> 02:06.082
What is all this?

02:09.258 --> 02:11.827
A new position in
office has just opened up.

02:12.915 --> 02:13.916
What position?

02:16.092 --> 02:17.224
Yours.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.532
What was that?

03:00.484 --> 03:02.921
Listen in, we
have assets on the ground,

03:02.965 --> 03:04.227
call sign Charlie One.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.188
You will RV with them 10
clicks southeast from the DZ.

03:09.450 --> 03:12.670
To confirm, target's
name is Abdul Ali,

03:13.845 --> 03:16.239
MI6 have had eyes on him
since he left Heathrow

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
and tracked him to
his current location.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.201
We believe he has information
on a high profile target

03:22.202 --> 03:24.160
and we need to bring him in.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.553
So try not to brass him up.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.644
Hey Scotland!

03:29.687 --> 03:31.820
Whats happening?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.711
Oi, you do know it's
part of your initiation.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.086
You gotta clean our boots
when we get back to cover.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.649
I'll make you eat
your fucking boots.

03:38.674 --> 03:39.915
Hey, easy tiger!

03:46.661 --> 03:48.532
I will walk in so
much shit, mate,

03:48.576 --> 03:50.752
you're gonna clean these
boots for a week, bro.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.843
F-N-G.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.584
Fuckin' new guy!

03:56.627 --> 03:58.267
Right stop fucking about,

03:58.311 --> 04:00.271
I was in Baghdad while you
were in your dad's bag,

04:00.296 --> 04:02.024
you'll all be cleaning
my fucking boots.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.678
Time to switch on, fellas.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.594
FLIR has detected multiple
heat signatures in the AO.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.726
Intel suggests the compound
is heavily guarded,

04:08.770 --> 04:10.032
so it pays to be a winner.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.468
Remember, stay
low and move fast.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.861
Let's do it!

04:12.904 --> 04:13.904
Good luck, gents.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.410
Guns at war!

04:59.603 --> 05:01.039
RPG!

05:24.585 --> 05:26.195
Get down, get down!

05:29.285 --> 05:31.200
Choppers are ready
for a hot extraction.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.333
Lay down some top
cover for Green Eye.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.430
In my time as defense secretary,

05:43.473 --> 05:47.216
I have come across countless
examples of bravery and courage

05:47.259 --> 05:49.914
all over the world
from the men and women

05:49.958 --> 05:52.917
serving in our special forces,

05:52.961 --> 05:56.094
but none continue
to astound more

05:56.138 --> 05:59.576
than the results and
success of this unit alone.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.970
This operation
lead to the capture

06:02.013 --> 06:05.408
of one of the world's
most prolific and high-profile

06:05.452 --> 06:10.195
targetsand, and no doubt saved
incredible amounts of lives.

06:11.632 --> 06:15.331
Although it is your duty to
fight and serve in secrecy

06:15.375 --> 06:17.246
without public recognition,

06:18.465 --> 06:22.164
it is my honor and
most humble privilege

06:22.207 --> 06:25.602
to be invited here today to
present this symbol of gratitude

06:25.646 --> 06:28.562
for your courage
and great service

06:28.605 --> 06:30.520
to your Queen and country.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.568
I'd rather her let me take
her panties down.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.487
Sergeant Jake O'Neil.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.197
Good work, Sergeant.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.241
Thank you.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.225
Whats with all the armed guards?

07:29.144 --> 07:30.145
Jakey boy!

07:31.929 --> 07:35.237
You wouldn't tell me you're
trying the backdoor?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.674
Party's just getting started.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.118
Don't you look nice?

07:50.426 --> 07:52.123
Here's a tenner, right?

07:52.167 --> 07:55.083
Will you, will you get
yourself a wee drink.

07:55.126 --> 07:58.565
'Cause us boys, we
need to have a chat.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.784
I can look after
myself, thanks, Smudge.

08:01.742 --> 08:02.917
All right.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.745
Go on.

08:04.788 --> 08:08.357
Look mate, there's someone
I want you to meet.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.805
Sergeant O'Neil, please come in.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.636
Corporal Smith, can you
give us a minute, please?

08:29.291 --> 08:30.945
Shut the door on your way out.

08:47.352 --> 08:50.355
Drink. Scotch, Brandy?

08:50.399 --> 08:52.479
Do you want to just tell
me what this is all about?

08:54.098 --> 08:56.666
Take a seat, please.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.980
That's what I like about
men like you, Jake.

09:06.023 --> 09:09.374
Straight to the
point, no nonsense.

09:09.418 --> 09:12.813
You see it's that, that's
what I'm looking for.

09:14.858 --> 09:19.863
I've got an offer for you, but
I'm only gonna offer it once.

09:20.081 --> 09:23.345
I need someone to head
up a private operation,

09:23.388 --> 09:25.216
someone with some balls

09:25.260 --> 09:27.305
who's not afraid to take action.

09:27.349 --> 09:30.004
You seem to have earned
quite a name for yourself

09:30.047 --> 09:32.833
with all your
operational success.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.009
Now, I have a sideline project

09:35.052 --> 09:37.489
that could make
you a very rich man

09:38.229 --> 09:40.884
and make your life very
comfortable indeed.

09:40.928 --> 09:44.758
Unless of course, you enjoy
spending your life away

09:44.801 --> 09:47.064
getting shot at for
next to nothing?

09:49.066 --> 09:51.242
You think I do
what I do for money?

09:55.986 --> 09:57.292
I fight for a purpose,

09:59.903 --> 10:02.427
not like these mercenaries
you got stood around here.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.389
Now, you might be impressin'
everyone with all of this,

10:10.261 --> 10:12.437
but I know exactly what
kind of man you are.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.224
I wonder what it
is you fight for?

10:16.267 --> 10:18.356
None of your fucking business.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.619
Careful, Jake.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.840
There you are.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.366
I don't think
we've been introduced.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.281
Come on, we're going.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.720
Jake, you're
making a big mistake.

11:39.046 --> 11:39.873
Okay.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.963
The money's in your account.

11:46.270 --> 11:49.839
Look, I've got a lot riding
on this, do we have a deal?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.281
You fuck me on this,

12:00.545 --> 12:01.764
I'll kill your family.

13:06.873 --> 13:07.961
What is it?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.181
No Jade, wait!

13:15.795 --> 13:16.621
Wait!

13:33.334 --> 13:34.335
Get through!

13:46.086 --> 13:46.869
Are you okay?

13:46.913 --> 13:48.784
That was scary.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.615
Please, don't
ever do that again.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.618
Friends?

13:57.488 --> 13:58.315
Friends.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.230
Come on.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.233
He refreshes my soul,

14:03.277 --> 14:05.453
even though I walk through
the darkest valley,

14:05.496 --> 14:07.498
I will fear no evil,
for he is beside me.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.633
Lord, please take care of
young Jake in this dark hour.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.436
We ask you, Lord, to
welcome Martha and Scott

14:13.461 --> 14:15.463
into your lights,
allow them to dwell

14:15.506 --> 14:19.249
in the house of the Lord
forever in eternity.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.546
You got to take care of Jake.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.580
And what the hell
do you expect me to do

14:59.605 --> 15:00.769
with an eight-year-old boy.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.510
Both his parents
just got wiped out.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.425
We're the only
two he's got left.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.997
Some of us are still out
there fighting real wars,

15:11.040 --> 15:13.260
while you're pissin'
about playing dress up.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.566
You know I can't take him.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
I'm deep undercover on
this Archibald thing.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.746
Something big's going
down, I can feel it.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.141
Anyway, I've got me hands full

15:25.185 --> 15:27.230
looking after Jade
on my own since,

15:30.016 --> 15:31.104
since Mary passed.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.283
I'm not cut out to
play happy families.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.982
My missus gives me
enough shit as it is.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.844
Finally, she'll have
someone in the house

15:42.869 --> 15:45.002
she can have a mature
conversation with.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.423
I dunno mate.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.426
It's one big responsibility.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.082
Remember Bosnia?

15:55.345 --> 15:56.433
How could I forget?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.436
One dirty fucking war.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.657
Then remember how
O'Neil saved your life.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
You owe it to him to
look after his boy.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.885
You know, it was the that way,
they'd do the same for us.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.802
After all the shit us three
have been through together,

16:20.327 --> 16:22.982
Stupid bastard gets
wiped out by a truck.

16:26.811 --> 16:27.943
I'll do it for Scotty,

16:32.295 --> 16:35.081
but you can break the
news to my missus.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.686
I have to go away.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.344
I know.

17:21.387 --> 17:24.130
They said it would be far away.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.349
I hope I'll see you again.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.527
I made this for you.

17:30.571 --> 17:33.052
That way, we'll always
remember each other

17:33.095 --> 17:35.228
and we'll always be close.

17:46.804 --> 17:51.809
I will see you again, I promise.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.111
Where's the bracelet?

18:34.069 --> 18:34.852
I took it off.

18:34.896 --> 18:35.723
Why?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.162
Jade, we need to talk.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.559
So, you bring me
here of all places?

18:49.867 --> 18:50.694
How is she?

18:56.613 --> 18:57.440
She's good.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.662
She struggles with
me going away a lot.

19:05.013 --> 19:05.970
She makes me happy.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.104
I'm,

19:09.148 --> 19:10.149
I'm pleased for you.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.455
Jade.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.937
No, I am, I, I'm
really happy for you.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.678
Just as long as
she's good to you.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.687
You know, just as
long as one day,

19:28.210 --> 19:33.172
one day we can be together,
like we promised that we would.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.787
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

20:03.158 --> 20:03.985
Okay.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.492
Welcome to the party.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.251
Fuck me, you big lad.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.950
You expecting some
trouble or what?

21:39.994 --> 21:41.300
Where's the case?

21:44.390 --> 21:45.608
Man of few words?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.092
No bother.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.006
Bring me the case.

22:03.539 --> 22:06.368
Think you're gonna
love this, pal.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.083
Archibald sends his regards.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.831
Fucking get him!

24:09.099 --> 24:11.232
Please, it was Archibald.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.412
Come on mate, it
was just business.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.849
Where are my drugs?

24:19.893 --> 24:24.158
We were told to bring you
here and kill you and your crew

24:25.507 --> 24:28.641
and then we were
gonna split the cash.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.613
It's just business.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.982
All right.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.289
Come on, mate, you all right?

25:08.332 --> 25:09.116
Mate?

25:09.159 --> 25:10.596
Joey, Joey, get a medic!

25:10.639 --> 25:12.946
Take a seat mate,
you'll be all right.

25:12.989 --> 25:13.903
Hey, are you okay?

25:18.908 --> 25:20.649
Come on, son!

25:21.998 --> 25:22.999
Fucking cheap shot.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.569
Never had you down as
a dirty fighter, Mac.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.748
There's no school like the
old school, kid.

25:32.792 --> 25:33.967
Fuck off.

25:38.014 --> 25:41.540
It was your folks
anniversary last week.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.325
Yeah, I know.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.203
I knew your old man
a long time, Jake.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.817
He'd be proud of you, son.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.386
Thanks, Mac.

26:12.788 --> 26:13.615
This is Mac.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.010
Go ahead.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.710
Roger that.

26:23.712 --> 26:24.583
We're on our way.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.937
I'll round up the lads.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.103
A state of sheer panic

27:50.146 --> 27:52.627
looms over the streets of
New Basford this evening

27:52.671 --> 27:55.848
as armed gunmen have taken
four hostages captive

27:55.891 --> 27:57.763
in a dramatic and
harrowing incident.

28:03.116 --> 28:06.032
Please, just let my family go.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.425
They had nothing to do with
this, they're so young!

28:08.469 --> 28:10.514
Please, just let them go!

28:11.907 --> 28:13.996
Mr. Archibald,
Independent Times News,

28:14.040 --> 28:15.606
has there been
indications the motives

28:15.650 --> 28:17.696
behind specifically
targeting your family?

28:18.871 --> 28:20.960
I have no idea why
they picked on us, no.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.746
Right now, we are using
every resource we have

28:24.790 --> 28:27.923
to find a peaceful resolution

28:27.967 --> 28:31.187
and to bring the children
home safely, thank you.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.321
Police have surrounded
the building behind me,

28:34.364 --> 28:36.671
and negotiations are
currently underway.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.587
The place has been cornered off.

28:39.630 --> 28:43.678
Will the police be able
to find a calm resolution?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.115
At present, it is
difficult to say.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.944
Yesterday at 1600 hours,

28:48.988 --> 28:51.338
four hostages were
taken at gunpoint

28:51.381 --> 28:53.862
from their home in Nottingham.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.086
Run the video.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.083
What're you doing?

29:19.279 --> 29:22.586
The terrorists had executed
a further two family members

29:22.630 --> 29:24.710
before taking the hostages
to this abandoned factory.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.554
We believe the
factory is being used

29:26.579 --> 29:28.972
for the manufacturing of PBIEDs

29:29.593 --> 29:31.204
and the distribution
of narcotics.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.641
So, be aware of any booby traps

29:33.684 --> 29:35.686
or any other little surprises.

29:37.123 --> 29:40.430
Now, the hostages are the
family MP Harry Archibald,

29:41.562 --> 29:43.651
meaning the whole
world's eyes are on us,

29:43.694 --> 29:45.392
making this a
high-profile target.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.047
So, no fuck up gents.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.049
Let's do this one by the book.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.833
I can't fucking believe that.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.923
I was fucking well in there.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.230
Those two slags were
fucking well up for it.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.554
Yeah man, proper on it.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.219
I was a bit smashed
fucking both of them

30:00.244 --> 30:01.451
and my attitude could fuck...

30:01.495 --> 30:03.295
Would you give it a
rest, would you, Smudge?

30:03.320 --> 30:05.281
You're fucking boring me.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.893
What the fuck has
crawled up your ass?

30:07.936 --> 30:09.546
You need to chill
the fuck out, mate.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.853
Maybe get yourself
fucking laid or something.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.465
Just give me a fucking reason.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.293
Jake, that's enough.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.081
That's enough.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.329
You people like guns.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.116
Don't you?

30:57.638 --> 30:58.639
Bang!

31:02.512 --> 31:04.514
I don't like using guns.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.258
I like a knife.

31:10.781 --> 31:15.003
I can see the reflection,
you see the pretty light?

31:18.267 --> 31:19.529
The cold steel.

31:25.709 --> 31:26.493
To cut you!

31:28.408 --> 31:29.975
Like a little fish,

31:31.977 --> 31:34.849
and you can't do
anything about it.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.359
And then what
we'll try and do...

31:52.384 --> 31:53.999
I'm looking for
the person in charge.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.177
You're looking at him.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.135
Right, my men have
cleared the area.

32:00.179 --> 32:03.008
I have some information
that may be of use to you.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.531
Go on.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.621
We've identified one of
the terrorists as Abdul Ali.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.578
Abdul Ali?

32:08.622 --> 32:09.971
We put him away years back.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.582
Sir, I have something for you.

32:12.626 --> 32:16.282
Don't call me sir,
darling, I work for a living.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.243
Intelligence report
from SRR and MI6,

32:21.287 --> 32:23.167
apparently they've been
tracking their movements

32:23.192 --> 32:24.377
over the last two years.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.260
They've discovered a
network of drug smuggling,

32:26.285 --> 32:29.332
human trafficking across the
UK borders to the mainland.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.734
The French cut a deal in
2010 to have Abdul released

32:33.777 --> 32:35.562
in exchange for one
of their journalists,

32:35.605 --> 32:37.433
who was captured by GARSI.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.522
We've had surveillance
on them ever since.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.424
We have an electronic log

32:42.449 --> 32:44.886
from Dalmar's phone and his PDA.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.573
And what did we get?

32:46.616 --> 32:48.575
Not a lot, but we do know

32:48.618 --> 32:51.665
he's been in communication
with Harry Archibald.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.450
Archibald?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.167
We believe the kidnapping
had something to do with a deal

32:57.192 --> 32:59.455
that went south between
Dalmar and Archibald.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.024
These were taken by
reconnaissance operatives

33:03.068 --> 33:04.025
in Daybrook.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.788
Right, let's get Archibald
in for questioning,

33:27.831 --> 33:29.224
let's see what he knows.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.166
Media's gonna have
a field day with this.

33:32.191 --> 33:34.664
I don't give a
fuck about the media.

33:34.708 --> 33:35.535
Get him in.

33:42.672 --> 33:47.068
Whoever we find inside, I
want him covered or killed.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.288
Roger that.

34:09.612 --> 34:13.094
Okay gents, eight hours at 0630.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.791
Sniper in position.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.967
No one moves before my go.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.364
I've got eyes on
lads, ready when you are.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.327
Robber One, you
are clear to engage.

34:28.370 --> 34:29.545
Hustle, gents.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.004
Daddy hasn't paid up.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.223
Time has run out for you.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.052
No, don't take
her, don't take her!

36:25.095 --> 36:25.922
No!

36:37.064 --> 36:37.891
No!

36:41.286 --> 36:42.939
Robber One, this is Zero.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.855
What the fuck is
going on in there?

36:51.034 --> 36:53.428
Delta One Zero,
this is Bravo One.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.517
Keep your eyes on.

36:55.561 --> 36:56.475
What's going on?

36:57.302 --> 36:58.172
We out.

37:03.525 --> 37:04.309
Fuck this.

37:04.352 --> 37:05.440
Smudge, no!

37:18.758 --> 37:19.585
Cover me!

37:26.026 --> 37:26.853
Fire!

37:46.829 --> 37:47.743
Canister!

38:34.312 --> 38:36.139
Tango down.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.232
Trig, rope up.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.310
Man down!

39:16.354 --> 39:17.180
Cover me!

39:26.581 --> 39:27.781
Stop fucking whining.

39:27.806 --> 39:28.627
Fuckin' hell!

39:28.670 --> 39:30.498
It's just a flesh
wound, you pussy.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.329
Mac, we need a
medic in here now!

39:35.373 --> 39:36.613
Tell him to hang tight.

39:36.657 --> 39:38.217
As soon as it's clear,
I'll send them in

39:38.242 --> 39:39.594
and get him patched up.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.358
Take this, we need
to go after the hostages.

39:41.383 --> 39:42.031
Fuck off then!

39:42.075 --> 39:43.598
Watch your six.

40:05.664 --> 40:06.839
They're in there.

40:06.882 --> 40:11.887
Smudge, this is
your time to shine.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.858
Don't fucking move!

40:25.901 --> 40:27.294
Put your hands up!

40:27.337 --> 40:28.382
Dalmar!

40:30.515 --> 40:31.472
They kidnapped us!

40:31.516 --> 40:32.516
- Calm down.
- He's got...

40:32.541 --> 40:33.866
Calm down!

40:33.909 --> 40:35.476
My sister's dead,
she's dead, she's...

40:35.520 --> 40:37.696
Don't worry, it's all over.

40:37.739 --> 40:41.482
They killed her, they
killed her.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.564
What happened to the boy?

40:44.589 --> 40:45.965
Where are the others?

40:46.008 --> 40:47.880
They took him.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.534
Trig, get in here.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.234
You all right?

40:54.277 --> 40:55.496
Yeah.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.940
It's, okay, you're
safe now, yeah?

40:56.965 --> 40:59.315
Come on, let's get
you out of here.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.808
Mac, get medics on standby.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.070
Roger that.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.681
The MC heading to the exo point.

41:06.725 --> 41:09.379
Easy now, easy, come
on, come on, come on.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.342
Do you want to shoot me then?

41:15.385 --> 41:16.386
Do you want to shoot me?

41:16.430 --> 41:17.550
Where'd you learn that from?

41:17.575 --> 41:18.799
Fucking, color me done up then!

41:18.824 --> 41:20.184
If you're
gonna shoot me, shoot me!

41:20.209 --> 41:21.849
Fuckin' telling me that?
You sick bastard!

41:21.874 --> 41:22.839
Go on shoot me.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.441
Is that what you want?

41:24.485 --> 41:25.685
- Yeah, come on.
- Why not?

41:26.571 --> 41:27.746
This is for Archibald.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.794
Hostages are secure.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.449
Jake's on his own, Mac,
permission to go back in.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.930
Bravo One, send SITREP, over.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.092
Zero.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.530
I'm pinned down.

43:17.159 --> 43:18.944
Let me go, please.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.947
Now, shut the fuck up.

43:21.990 --> 43:24.036
Alfie, is that you buddy?

43:24.079 --> 43:25.211
Yes.

43:25.254 --> 43:26.494
- You go away!
- Please help me!

43:26.519 --> 43:27.430
Go away!

43:28.997 --> 43:31.304
Listen, I'm lowering my
weapon, and I'm coming in.

43:31.347 --> 43:32.261
Get away!

43:32.305 --> 43:33.698
I'm coming in.

43:33.741 --> 43:35.581
Throw the gun down,
just throw that gun down!

43:35.613 --> 43:36.657
Okay.

43:36.701 --> 43:37.919
Throw the gun down!

43:37.963 --> 43:38.746
Throw the gun away!

43:38.790 --> 43:39.965
You'll be all right,

43:40.008 --> 43:41.662
I'm gonna make
sure you get home.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.229
Let the kid go!

43:43.272 --> 43:45.187
Listen to me, drop the weapon!

43:45.231 --> 43:48.147
Assad has been taken away,
there is no way out for you.

43:48.190 --> 43:49.148
Let him go!

43:49.191 --> 43:50.431
Believe me, I will shoot him.

43:50.456 --> 43:52.151
Alfie, look at me,
I promise you, mate,

43:52.194 --> 43:55.067
you're not gonna get hurt, okay?

43:55.110 --> 43:56.270
Throw the gun down.

43:56.295 --> 43:57.417
Throw the gun down.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.943
Honestly, we're
getting out okay, okay?

44:01.987 --> 44:02.770
It's all over.

44:02.814 --> 44:03.902
- Jake!
- No!

44:05.643 --> 44:07.645
Look what you've done!

44:09.037 --> 44:10.473
Medic!

44:24.096 --> 44:26.489
I had him, I fucking had him!

44:45.639 --> 44:46.466
Jake.

44:59.044 --> 44:59.871
Come in!

45:18.193 --> 45:21.066
My discharge papers.

45:27.028 --> 45:31.337
This is the job,
sometimes things go south.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.731
We can't win 'em all.

45:34.644 --> 45:35.471
Look.

45:36.777 --> 45:39.562
The report showed that
it wasn't your fault.

45:39.606 --> 45:42.522
You did everything you could
to save that little boy,

45:42.565 --> 45:45.003
so take some time out and
get your head together.

45:48.397 --> 45:49.834
I watched a nine-year-old boy

45:49.877 --> 45:51.923
get his fucking brains blown out

45:51.966 --> 45:54.577
by someone that we
put away years back.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.449
That's above our pay grade.

45:57.537 --> 45:58.799
You know the game.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.151
When are you going
to wake up, Mac?

46:05.588 --> 46:09.331
I mean, I know most politicians
are lying fucking snakes,

46:09.375 --> 46:13.771
but Harry Archibald, I mean,
he takes the fucking prize.

46:13.814 --> 46:16.338
Doing deals with drug
dealers and terrorists

46:17.775 --> 46:19.864
and we know that two of
his children were shot dead

46:19.907 --> 46:22.997
because of some fucked up
operation that he was running.

46:23.041 --> 46:26.348
Yet he's walking around
free, you tell me why?

46:29.047 --> 46:30.767
Me and your dad had
to get our hands dirty

46:30.792 --> 46:33.360
from time to time for the
sake of Queen and country,

46:34.487 --> 46:35.793
but we never questioned it.

46:37.446 --> 46:38.839
That's how wars are won kid.

46:42.974 --> 46:44.410
The day your parents died,

46:45.628 --> 46:48.066
I vowed to always
take care of you.

46:48.109 --> 46:50.851
I've looked after you
like you were my own son.

46:50.895 --> 46:53.288
I trained you to be
the best you can be.

46:53.332 --> 46:56.204
Your dad was the
toughest son of a bitch

46:57.379 --> 46:59.207
and the best soldier
that I ever knew.

47:11.916 --> 47:15.310
He'd be fucking ashamed
of you right now.

47:17.225 --> 47:21.273
Yeah, well he's not
fucking here now, is he?

47:26.844 --> 47:27.670
And I'm out.

47:29.455 --> 47:31.196
I expected more from you, Jake.

47:40.205 --> 47:42.642
Sergeant Jake O'Neil,
you're dismissed.

48:18.896 --> 48:19.722
Hey!

48:22.682 --> 48:24.336
Give me another one.

48:36.000 --> 48:36.826
Again.

48:42.658 --> 48:44.138
You need to pay your tab, mate.

48:44.182 --> 48:46.053
You've been sat there
all fucking day.

48:58.587 --> 48:59.762
Fucking prick.

49:31.011 --> 49:32.371
What the fuck
are you doing here?

49:32.404 --> 49:34.536
You weren't supposed
to be home yet!

49:34.580 --> 49:37.235
Jake, just say something,
don't get upset!

50:25.979 --> 50:26.806
Fuck it.

50:38.339 --> 50:41.125
All right, baby,
let's get lucky tonight.

50:41.168 --> 50:42.735
No more bets, please.

50:51.048 --> 50:51.918
13 black.

50:55.661 --> 50:56.531
All right.

51:03.408 --> 51:04.931
Come on, I can't believe it.

51:20.381 --> 51:21.339
Fuck it, all in.

51:24.559 --> 51:25.473
This is insane.

51:25.517 --> 51:26.953
Final bets, please.

51:29.521 --> 51:30.348
Give me.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.051
Five red.

51:48.453 --> 51:52.544
The odds seem not to be
in your favor mate, sorry.

52:12.651 --> 52:14.131
Final bets, please.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.426
What can I get you?

52:30.451 --> 52:31.931
A cosmopolitan, please.

52:42.115 --> 52:43.508
Having a rough night, are we?

52:45.466 --> 52:47.729
Yeah, you could say that.

52:49.122 --> 52:51.472
Do you wanna get out of here?

54:25.610 --> 54:29.744
I'm promise, I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

54:30.832 --> 54:34.096
Jake!

54:34.140 --> 54:38.231
He'd be fucking
ashamed of you right now.

54:40.712 --> 54:42.540
Are you ready now?

54:42.583 --> 54:44.281
Stop fuckin' around!

55:14.746 --> 55:15.616
Come on.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.923
I'm not that kind of girl.

55:37.508 --> 55:39.336
No, Jack, what are you doing?

55:39.379 --> 55:40.162
What?

55:40.206 --> 55:41.120
Get off, not here.

55:41.163 --> 55:42.643
It's so fun, come on, girl.

55:42.687 --> 55:45.603
No, get off, Jack, I said no.

55:45.646 --> 55:46.691
Come on, just enjoy it.

55:46.734 --> 55:48.170
Jack, fuck off!

55:49.737 --> 55:51.043
What the fuck is your problem?

55:51.086 --> 55:52.174
Jack, fuck off, please.

55:52.218 --> 55:53.393
- Come on.
- Fuck off.

55:53.437 --> 55:54.742
Get off me!

55:54.786 --> 55:56.353
Hey!

55:56.396 --> 55:57.919
What the fuck are you doing?

55:57.963 --> 55:58.877
Leave her alone.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.400
Who the fuck are you?

56:16.982 --> 56:21.073
Fucking get him,
get him, go on, get him!

56:22.770 --> 56:24.511
Fucking get him, now.

56:28.602 --> 56:31.213
- Come on then.
- All right, mate.

57:19.871 --> 57:22.221
Here, you take this.

57:26.921 --> 57:28.270
Take care, mate.

58:17.885 --> 58:19.496
Hi there, I'm Ralph,
I'm the manager.

58:19.539 --> 58:20.584
Hello.

58:20.627 --> 58:21.947
Nice to meet you. Come this way.

58:21.976 --> 58:23.108
Yeah, sure.

59:05.411 --> 59:08.588
Jade, if you're hearing this,

59:08.632 --> 59:09.807
then I am already dead.

59:10.982 --> 59:13.201
I have left this tape
in a safety deposit box

59:13.245 --> 59:15.639
that only you will
be able to access

59:15.682 --> 59:18.859
when you're old
enough to understand.

59:18.903 --> 59:22.210
Be careful with what you do
with it and who you trust.

59:23.647 --> 59:27.999
Archibald is a very dangerous
man with eyes everywhere

59:28.042 --> 59:29.740
and he will stop at nothing.

59:30.958 --> 59:33.482
I'm sorry I can't be
there for you now,

59:33.526 --> 59:36.442
but know I will always love you

59:36.485 --> 59:39.184
no matter what, my sweet girl.

59:47.496 --> 59:48.802
Jake, wake up.

59:53.981 --> 59:54.808
It's okay.

59:59.421 --> 01:00:00.248
Jade?

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:33.064
What's happened to you?

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.639
What are you doing here?

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:45.424
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:49.950
Leave me alone.

01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:57.741
Please Jake, I need your help.

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:03.311
Look at me.

01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:09.317
What can I help with?

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:15.976
You're the only one
that I can turn to.

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:24.202
What else do I have to give?

01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:26.987
What do you expect from me?

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:34.386
I don't care about any of this.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:37.824
And I don't care about you.

01:01:42.481 --> 01:01:43.351
Leave me alone.

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:49.009
You said you would
always be there for me.

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:14.339
I'm sorry.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:18.560
What is it?

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:22.739
It's about my dad, Jake.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:29.441
I told you he was murdered.

01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:32.749
And now, I have proof.

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:41.975
We were on the run, living
in the middle of nowhere.

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:46.066
Dad knew we were in too deep.

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:50.201
The night he was murdered

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.726
is something that
will always haunt me.

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:46.083
Dad, what's wrong,
what's going on?

01:03:46.126 --> 01:03:47.686
You need to take
this key and hide it.

01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:49.477
Whatever happens, you
do not let anybody

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:51.088
know you got it, okay?

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:52.567
Dad, you're scaring me

01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:54.265
Jade listen to me, promise me!

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:55.832
I promise.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.035
I need you to get under
the bed and not make a sound.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.444
Now, can you do that for me?

01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:00.271
I love you!

01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:01.663
I love you too.

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:06.016
Under the bed now,
go, go, go, quick!

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:11.978
They broke into our house
looking for that tape.

01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:14.851
Nothing would've stopped them

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:16.591
until they got
what they came for.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.499
No one believed me, no
matter who I turned to.

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:59.460
Not the police, not
the social workers,

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.202
not even you.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:11.429
What's going on, Harry?

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:14.084
What in God's name
are we doing here?

01:05:14.127 --> 01:05:15.346
What's so bloody urgent?

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:22.875
What is all this?

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:26.357
A new position in
office has just opened up.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.359
What position?

01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:30.927
Yours.

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.558
Jade, whats wrong?

01:07:26.346 --> 01:07:27.217
What is it?

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:31.873
Jake, I don't think
this is a good idea,

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:33.832
I don't think we should
go through with it.

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:38.054
What if something
happens to you,

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.359
I'll never forgive myself.

01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:40.317
Jade, listen...

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.101
No, you listen to me, Jake.

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:44.495
You're all I've got left.

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:46.497
I can't lose you as well.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.629
I can't be on my own again.

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.370
Nothing is going
to happen to us.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.070
I said I'd protect you.

01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:56.594
I'm not going anywhere.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.642
You don't understand what
this man is capable of.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:07.561
Jake, I told you, remember, he
shot and he killed my father

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:11.652
right in front of me
and no one believed me.

01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:14.090
No one helped me.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:17.919
He's untouchable.

01:08:17.962 --> 01:08:21.966
No one's untouchable,
not now we have proof.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.403
There's no hiding from that.

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:33.631
I'm sorry that I didn't
listen to you before.

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.241
So, what are you planning to do?

01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:38.095
You know he's got the
police in his pocket.

01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:39.941
They're not gonna touch him.

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:41.899
That's why I'm not
going to the police.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:45.337
And so what?

01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:46.542
You're just gonna go up there

01:08:46.567 --> 01:08:48.863
and ask him to hand himself in?

01:08:48.907 --> 01:08:51.214
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:54.564
We've got enough evidence to
put him away for a lifetime,

01:08:54.608 --> 01:08:55.888
and I'm gonna give
him the chance

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:57.742
to finally do the right thing.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.613
Otherwise we'll just
go to the media.

01:09:01.093 --> 01:09:03.617
We can't let him get away with
what he did to your father.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.055
And what if you get hurt?

01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:09.928
Jake please, please,
let's just leave this now.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.537
Let's go away, lets leave here.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.194
He's too dangerous.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:19.024
He doesn't know the
meaning of the word,

01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:21.765
but if he tries to fuck
with us, then he will.

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:29.252
I told you I'll
take care of you.

01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:06.104
So, what do you think?

01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:09.368
Is this really something
you want to get into?

01:12:12.197 --> 01:12:15.809
Look, I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.857
but I need your help on this.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.727
Help?

01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:23.600
Help with what,
what do you mean?

01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:24.992
I'm gonna bring him down.

01:12:30.607 --> 01:12:33.174
All right big man,
what's your plan?

01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:37.483
I need to get
inside that building.

01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:42.053
You're the only one close
enough to get me in.

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:44.621
I think you are fucking crazy.

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:49.103
Do you realize what
you're walking into?

01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:50.801
You'll not get past
the front door.

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:58.591
Come on, can you help
me with this or not?

01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:04.380
I'll see what I can do.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:09.210
Good man.

01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:14.302
I knew I could count on you.

01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:42.156
We've got a problem.

01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:52.471
Mac.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:02.742
I just wanted to apologize
for what happened before.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.795
Mate, I'm sorry.

01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:15.755
I've known you your whole life.

01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:18.932
You never have to
say sorry to me.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.283
What's going on?

01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.024
It's Jade.

01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.071
She's in trouble.

01:14:27.114 --> 01:14:29.247
Why, what's happened?

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.162
Her dad left her
a surveillance tape

01:14:31.205 --> 01:14:34.600
that proves that Archibald
shot the Mayor of Nottingham.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:35.819
So, what's your plan?

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.649
You can't go to the authorities.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:41.477
We all know how
that story will end.

01:14:43.087 --> 01:14:44.567
That's why I need your help.

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:46.743
What do you need?

01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:50.268
Guns.

01:15:05.022 --> 01:15:07.764
Are you really sure about this?

01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:13.770
Kyle was your best friend.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.557
And I can't let
anything happen to her.

01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:25.782
Does that thing still work?

01:15:28.654 --> 01:15:30.830
Could do with a bit of grease.

01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:32.266
Why?

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.312
Where are you
thinking on taking it?

01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:35.675
Straight through the front door.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:28.627
Jake, Jake, please help me.

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:32.022
Jake!

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.898
Now, do I have your attention?

01:16:40.204 --> 01:16:42.859
I swear to god, if
you fucking touch her.

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.253
I think it's time we met.

01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:50.257
I'm coming for you.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.045
He's on his way.

01:16:55.088 --> 01:16:56.394
Get the men ready.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.432
I'm in position now.

01:17:35.738 --> 01:17:39.002
There's a lotta people
down there, kid.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.112
South side's all clear.

01:18:02.155 --> 01:18:04.157
Keep an eye out, stay alert.

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:19.172
I have visual.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:21.609
Wait for my go.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:27.485
As soon as you're in the
building, you're on your own.

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.722
Let's move out!

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:05.975
Cover me!

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.197
Move out!

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.735
Motherfucker!

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:48.582
Grenade!

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:06.035
My leg!

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:08.820
Fuck you!

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:16.480
Jake!

01:21:16.523 --> 01:21:18.134
Jake, can you hear me, over.

01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:19.613
Jake, Jake, over.

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:46.700
He's coming up!

01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:16.339
He's on his way.

01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:44.694
He's making his way
up to the first floor.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.591
Does anyone have visual?

01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:49.807
Robber Team, come in.

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:51.156
Robber Team, do you read me?

01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:58.642
Hey, soldier boy.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.258
Suck on that bitch.

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:17.617
Drop it.

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.708
Why am I hearing gunfire?

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:24.189
I said to bring him in alive.

01:24:25.799 --> 01:24:26.974
Put it down.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.687
We've got him pinned down.

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:30.473
He's not goin' anywhere.

01:25:30.516 --> 01:25:31.604
Bring him to me.

You know your
fucking problem is?

01:26:09.207 --> 01:26:11.470
You're all this Queen

01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:15.039
Look at you now.

01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:18.825
You're a fucking mess.

01:26:23.613 --> 01:26:27.182
Face it, Jake, I'm
better than you.

01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:30.359
I always have been.

01:26:34.711 --> 01:26:38.018
And it's about time you found
out how weak you really are.

01:26:47.767 --> 01:26:49.160
Oh, fuck it.

01:26:51.945 --> 01:26:53.295
You motherfucker.

01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:10.050
Looks like you've failed, again.

01:27:12.879 --> 01:27:14.446
You lose, pretty boy.

01:27:15.882 --> 01:27:20.452
You're fucking pathetic you
know that, a fucking disgrace.

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:22.062
You think you're so smart

01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:23.760
with a fucking
hole in your head?

01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:27.546
You know you've always
been a little rat.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.290
How 'bout if I make that
wee girlfriend of yours

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:34.249
my bitch as well, yeah?

01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:39.036
Go on then.

01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:43.649
Are you gonna fuckin'
shoot me or what?

01:27:49.089 --> 01:27:51.744
You haven't got
the balls, have you?

01:27:54.747 --> 01:27:55.879
Look at me.

01:27:55.922 --> 01:27:56.836

Looks like I always will be
better than you, motherfucker.

01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:15.123
What's happening?

01:28:15.159 --> 01:28:15.942
Where is he?

01:28:15.986 --> 01:28:17.466
Smudge, answer me.

01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:33.220
Jesus Christ, Jake.

01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:38.182
Let her go.

01:28:38.225 --> 01:28:42.665
Here we are, rather
fitting, don't you think?

01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:45.407
Thank you for
finally joining us,

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:48.279
although I must say you're
a little worse for wear.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.150
Let her go.

01:28:51.935 --> 01:28:53.415
I've got the tape.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:56.809
You don't need her anymore.

01:28:57.984 --> 01:29:02.641
Jake, we could've
been so good together

01:29:02.685 --> 01:29:05.905
if you'd just had some
sense of ambition.

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:08.865
You two just couldn't help
yourselves, could you?

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:09.735
Jake!

01:29:10.736 --> 01:29:11.998
You've got what you need.

01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:17.352
Just take it.

01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:19.397
And let her go.

01:29:20.746 --> 01:29:23.314
Come on, just take
the fucking tape!

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.142
You've made your point.

01:29:27.623 --> 01:29:29.189
Put the gun down.

01:29:42.812 --> 01:29:43.639
Okay.

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:59.655
You think you're being
here happened by mistake?

01:29:59.698 --> 01:30:02.222
I could've had you
killed anytime I wanted.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.534
Everything you touch

01:30:09.578 --> 01:30:11.754
and everyone you care
about are now gone.

01:30:17.237 --> 01:30:19.326
And Jade, my little Jade,

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.418
how beautiful you've become,

01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:29.249
rather ironic you should meet
the same fate as your father

01:30:30.381 --> 01:30:32.165
for sticking your
nose into my business.

01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:34.472
Do you really think you're
gonna get away with this?

01:30:34.516 --> 01:30:35.995
The police are on their way.

01:30:37.083 --> 01:30:39.303
I know because I called them.

01:30:40.957 --> 01:30:43.481
I can see tomorrow's headlines.

01:30:43.525 --> 01:30:47.790
Special forces operative kills
everyone in the building,

01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:50.227
shoots his beloved girlfriend

01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:51.924
before turning the
gun on himself.

01:31:05.808 --> 01:31:07.070
You're crazy.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.507
You're fucking crazy.

01:31:10.595 --> 01:31:12.336
You sick twisted fuck.

01:31:15.339 --> 01:31:16.296
She's done nothing.

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:20.910
Just let her go.

01:31:20.953 --> 01:31:22.302
Give it to me.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:32.530
Pick it up!

01:31:38.623 --> 01:31:40.669
Don't you fucking touch her.

01:31:40.712 --> 01:31:43.280
You've got what you
need, now let her go!

01:31:43.323 --> 01:31:44.586
I want you to look at her.

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:47.589
Look at her and tell
her it's gonna be okay,

01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:52.115
Just like you told
my little boy.

01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:00.210
It's okay.

01:32:06.042 --> 01:32:06.869
It's okay.

01:32:08.261 --> 01:32:10.437
Jade, it's not your fault.

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.621
I love you.

01:32:28.151 --> 01:32:29.021
Jade, move!

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:41.294
You okay?

01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:42.469
He fucking shot me.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:53.002
We need to get out of here.

01:33:22.292 --> 01:33:24.033
Stop, Armed Police!

01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:37.786
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:04.639
Lower your weapons, he's
one of ours, you idiots.

01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:19.958
Everybody move back!

01:34:20.002 --> 01:34:25.007
Move back now.

01:35:01.347 --> 01:35:02.914
Mac.

01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:05.351
You don't do things
in halves, do you, kid?

01:35:08.485 --> 01:35:10.052
Nothing a lick
of paint won't fix.

01:35:12.663 --> 01:35:15.057
Who the hell is
responsible for this?

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.406
Do yo know what you've done,

01:35:16.449 --> 01:35:18.495
how much this is likely to cost?

01:35:18.538 --> 01:35:20.932
Do you have any regard
for public safety?

01:35:20.976 --> 01:35:22.376
For God's sake,
you've just blown up

01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:24.588
the most iconic
building in the city.

01:35:24.631 --> 01:35:27.460
Let alone my reputation and
the government's public image.

01:35:27.504 --> 01:35:29.985
You special forces
are all the same.

01:35:30.028 --> 01:35:32.248
You all think you're
above the law.

01:35:32.291 --> 01:35:34.903
Who the hell do you think
you are, bloody Bruce Willis?

01:35:47.654 --> 01:35:51.267
You might wanna
take a look at this.

01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:53.530
This is not the last
you've heard from me.

01:35:59.710 --> 01:36:02.800
That's one right hook
you got there, sweetheart.

01:36:02.844 --> 01:36:04.404
You make sure you
look after him for me.

01:36:04.429 --> 01:36:06.761
I will, don't worry.

01:36:06.804 --> 01:36:09.633
And you, don't let her go again.

01:36:11.417 --> 01:36:12.244
Cheers, Mac.

01:36:19.904 --> 01:36:22.777
So, does this mean
it's finally over?

01:36:24.604 --> 01:36:27.216
