♪ In heav'n the bells are ringing

00:05.280 --> 00:07.040
♪ Ding dong merrily on high. ♪

00:07.040 --> 00:09.280
You are one cheeky madam! Hmm.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.080
Good to see nothing's changed.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.880
Sidney! Hello, Sid!

00:14.880 --> 00:17.280
We weren't expecting you until
tomorrow.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.760
Yeah, I cadged a lift on the
diplomatic flight, didn't I?

00:19.760 --> 00:20.920
How's Aunt Fliss?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.840
Yes, she's good.
Sends her love. Oh, she's got news.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.360
One for you. One for you.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.840
And this comes with strict
instructions to

00:28.840 --> 00:30.440
open before Christmas.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.960
I hope this will go perfectly with
your sage twinset

00:40.960 --> 00:42.920
for the WI Committee dinner.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.440
The Duchess of Windsor has an
identical one.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.560
Ghastly woman, but there's no
denying

00:47.560 --> 00:49.400
she does have impeccable taste.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.320
Oh!

01:03.080 --> 01:05.519
I don't know what they've been
feeding you,

01:05.519 --> 01:07.840
but you're all skin and bones.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.600
It's good to be home. Sit down. Sit
down there.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.880
Plans for the holiday, Sid?

01:13.880 --> 01:16.840
Oh, you know, Mrs M's home-cooked
food, and a nice quiet Christmas.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.520
Oh! Oh! That is... Oh!

02:20.200 --> 02:22.440
Any idea who she is?

02:22.440 --> 02:27.040
Well, the money's
on Scarlett Dreyfuss. December 1946.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.280
The papers called it
the Red Riding Hood murder.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.040
Did a Big Bad Wolf get her?

02:33.040 --> 02:35.160
She was leading lady
in the Christmas pantomime.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.360
Left after the dress rehearsal,
and was never seen again.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.960
Next day, the cleaning lady finds
the bed unslept in.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.000
And downstairs, there's blood
and signs of a struggle.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.320
How did they know it was murder?

02:47.320 --> 02:48.600
A local man confessed,

02:48.600 --> 02:50.920
though he wouldn't say what
he did with the body.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.520
Currently serving
life in HMP Wynchurch.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.800
Well, that's something.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.440
What a waste.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.400
Have I missed something?

03:10.400 --> 03:13.840
The pantomime's being
held at the Haydock this year,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.920
so they need a much larger cast.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.480
No chance. Spend my holiday
cooped up in a theatre?

03:18.480 --> 03:21.440
No, thank you. Mind you, Mrs M,
you're the old pro.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.720
Well, I was roped
in for Fairy Godmother

03:23.720 --> 03:25.480
while on tour with my late husband.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.040
And I hear Father Brown is
quite the thespian.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.200
BOTH: Pontius Pilate.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.560
I think I gave a convincing
performance.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.640
The reviewer said it was murderous.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.320
Speaking of which, remember this?

03:50.840 --> 03:55.320
I spy the honourable
Penelope Windermere.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.560
Quite the box office draw.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.160
Let's pray she can sing and act.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.040
They won't be coming to listen
to her.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.440
I hope you don't expect me to
audition. Douglas.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.240
Douglas, shake a leg
and let them in.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.480
And may God have
mercy on our souls.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.720
Good afternoon. I'm Prudence Bovary,
the artistic director.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.400
Leading players, Rose Marie Sturgess

04:30.400 --> 04:32.960
and Dr Eugene Cornelius.

04:32.960 --> 04:38.480
And my son Douglas - our stage
manager, actor, and pianist.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.400
Aren't there a lot of you?

04:40.400 --> 04:43.360
Right. Douglas.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.120
Who are you reading for?

05:02.120 --> 05:04.680
Prince Charming! It's played by a
girl. Next!

05:09.240 --> 05:11.280
Next!

05:11.280 --> 05:14.360
Bunty Windermere,
auditioning for Cinderella.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.200
I don't think so, dear.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.280
Sleeping in the cinders.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.120
That's how I got my name.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.960
Ever since my father died, things
haven't been the same.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.800
Except mother bosses me around.
That's just the way it goes.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.760
Like the ash in the fireplace,
she does get up my nose.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.120
Next!

05:38.120 --> 05:43.040
Are you ready? One. One, two, three.
Next!

05:44.040 --> 05:48.200
This is Bridget McCarthy,
auditioning for the Fairy Godmother.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.000
At the stroke of midnight, please
beware - these things return to

05:52.000 --> 05:56.480
what they were. Your gown returns to
rags and cloak.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.520
Your pumpkin is no more a coach.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.640
But dance, be gay, perchance to
meet -

06:03.640 --> 06:06.280
a prince to sweep you off
your feet.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.240
Young man! How tall are you?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.600
Six foot two, why? Name?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.320
Sidney Carter. Whoa, whoa,
whoa - I'm not auditioning.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.800
No, I'm just here for moral support.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.920
Next!

06:29.240 --> 06:30.280
Dear God!

06:33.480 --> 06:37.680
The lights turn blue. It is dead
midnight.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.040
What do I fear?

06:41.040 --> 06:43.720
Myself? There is none else here.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.160
Richard loves Richard.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.960
That is, I am who I am.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.760
Is there a murderer here? No.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.760
Yes, I am. Then fly.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.520
Who from, myself?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.280
Thank you.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.400
Yes, sir?

07:30.400 --> 07:33.080
Tell me about Benedict Clough.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.400
Benny? Nice lad, but simple,
if you get my drift.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.520
Made a living making bicycle
deliveries.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.320
And Scarlett Dreyfuss?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.400
A newcomer,
rather racy for these parts.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.880
Two ex-husbands and a roving eye.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.120
She must have ruffled a few
feathers.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.880
She ruffled Benny's, all right.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.200
He followed her round like Mary's
little lamb.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.400
So when she went missing
he was number one suspect?

07:56.400 --> 08:00.680
He was spotted bicycling home in the
vicinity with scratches on his face.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.640
When the police turned up to
question him, he bolted.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.080
And when apprehended,
confessed his socks off.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.280
"I did something bad to
Miss Scarlett."

08:11.080 --> 08:14.040
Tried to assault her.
When she fought back, he panicked.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.560
Caved her skull in with a doorstop.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.120
Did he, now?

08:20.120 --> 08:23.080
Why all the interest
in a closed case?

08:23.080 --> 08:26.200
Because according to the
postmortem,

08:26.200 --> 08:29.120
Benedict Clough's confession
was a pack of lies.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.840
Fairy Godmother...

08:34.840 --> 08:36.480
Bunty Windermere.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.280
I know you had your heart set...

08:40.280 --> 08:43.919
No, no, no, that's wonderful.
Don't you worry about me.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.520
And you are...

08:49.400 --> 08:50.920
Prompt.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.920
An indispensable part of any
production.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
Yes, yes, of course it is.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.320
And Father Brown is Daisy.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.120
And so is Sid.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.440
That's a mistake.
I didn't even audition.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.240
And how can you have two Daisys?

09:10.240 --> 09:13.400
I think there is only one Daisy,
but she's in two halves.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.760
The house is all decorated.

09:26.760 --> 09:31.840
Holly and ivy, and all the old
decorations, except for the tree,

09:31.840 --> 09:33.800
which I'm saving for Christmas
Eve.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.360
Padre. I'd say this was a nice
surprise,

09:38.360 --> 09:41.040
but then I'd be lying on both
counts.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.560
Benny isn't very fond of the police,

09:44.560 --> 09:47.320
so they thought it best
a chaperone was present.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.640
Benny, this is Inspector Mallory.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.920
He's not as scary as he looks.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.560
Does he know when I'm going home?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.760
I'm afraid not,
but I do have some questions.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.640
In your confession, you said you hit
Scarlett on the head with

10:05.640 --> 10:09.080
a doorstop, which you then buried
with the body?

10:11.640 --> 10:17.160
We found the body. And there's no
signs of skull trauma.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.680
Or a murder weapon.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.160
When arrested, you said, "I did
something bad to Miss Scarlett".

10:30.160 --> 10:32.160
Can you explain what you meant?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.880
She said I'd go to hell. Nonsense.

10:35.560 --> 10:41.520
God forgives everyone who confesses
their sins and tells the truth.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.000
I had a delivery for Miss Scarlett.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.800
I saw her car in the theatre.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.240
So I went in...

10:55.720 --> 11:00.520
Bad boy! Playing Peeping Tom
on naked ladies! I wasn't.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.360
You'll go to hell for that.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.640
I brought your nerve
powder from Dr Cornelius.

11:07.640 --> 11:11.440
Was it worth it, Benny? Did you like
what you saw?

11:13.160 --> 11:15.760
There was no mention of this
in your statement.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.800
Benny can't read.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.000
The policeman wrote it and said

11:21.000 --> 11:23.960
if I signed it, then I'd be
home in time for Christmas.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.560
Lying's a Ten Commandment,
isn't it, Father?

11:28.560 --> 11:30.800
Number nine. Loud and clear.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.000
What about in court?
Why did you plead guilty?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.360
Ma said it was for the best.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.960
Maybe I should have a
word with your ma.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.440
She doesn't like policemen.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.800
I'll take a chaperone.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.440
Buttons, beware...

11:59.920 --> 12:01.680
Buttons, beware...

12:03.200 --> 12:06.640
The tree of truth will hear a lie.

12:06.640 --> 12:10.680
The tree of truth will hear a lie
and drop an apple in your eye.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.240
Good luck, Buttons.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.920
Is there a girl you love, Buttons?

12:25.160 --> 12:26.840
No.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.800
There is! Is she someone I know?

12:30.800 --> 12:31.840
No. Ow...

12:32.840 --> 12:36.160
I think you're fibbing,
Buttons. Who is she?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.680
It's... it's...

12:39.880 --> 12:43.320
Too early! Wait for the cue.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.840
Again, please!

12:45.840 --> 12:48.240
Be a brick, Barbara,
and gather up the apples.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.640
Er, it's Bridg...

12:57.320 --> 12:59.760
I was expecting something
rather more festive.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.440
If you mean the letters,
I write what he wants to hear.

13:05.440 --> 13:11.640
Benny loved Christmas. This place
would look like Santa's grotto.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.640
When they took him away,
I burnt the lot.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.520
What's the point of Christmas
without a child?

13:20.080 --> 13:22.000
Scarlett Dreyfuss....

13:22.000 --> 13:23.040
Was a succubus.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.080
Two Cs, one B. Thank you.

13:27.960 --> 13:32.880
Any male was fair game, even
a child in a man's body like Benny.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.800
Tell me about these other men?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.000
Ask that amateur dramatics lot.

13:40.240 --> 13:45.400
And then ask yourself why the police
didn't interview them at the time.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.160
Mrs Clough.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.480
As you clearly believe your son is
innocent, why did you get him

13:54.480 --> 13:56.240
to plead guilty?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.760
To save him from the noose.

13:59.160 --> 14:05.440
A guilty plea in return for a
reduced charge of manslaughter.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.720
Your DI Jones was very...

14:09.400 --> 14:10.920
..persuasive.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.440
DI Jones passed away last year.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.480
I'm on the case now
and if there has been any

14:17.480 --> 14:21.360
irregularity, you have my word
it will be investigated.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.720
And you can keep your nose out.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.280
This made you angry?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.880
Yes.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.000
And did you express your anger?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.680
It's happening again!

14:55.160 --> 14:57.520
That's another fine mess
you've got me into.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.240
That's showbiz, Sid!

14:59.240 --> 15:04.920
If anyone sees a cloak with a hood,
I need it for the forest scene.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.880
HE WOLF-WHISTLES

15:06.880 --> 15:08.160
Ow! Sidney!

15:09.720 --> 15:12.000
You look like a fairy tale!

15:12.000 --> 15:13.680
It's a bit big.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.720
Well, a few alterations will
soon fix that.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.920
I read all about the Red Riding
Hood murder.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.120
I suppose she was a friend of yours?

15:28.120 --> 15:29.520
She was a piece of work.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.560
Translation - she stole the leading
lady role from under your nose.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.160
I meant poor Douglas.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.200
He was engaged to a nice WAAF before
she got her claws in him.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.200
And that ghastly scene
at the dress rehearsal!

15:42.200 --> 15:45.440
I can't. Not here. I can't.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.560
Something tells me that you can.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.520
You stupid, stupid boy.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.280
You do know he's engaged to
be married?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.840
Maybe he can make an honest woman
out of me, instead.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
Then the flash pot went off,

15:59.840 --> 16:03.280
and Douglas had one of his episodes
and bolted.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.840
He'll marry the likes of you over my
dead body.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.160
Episodes?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.840
He had a bad war.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.600
I was treating him for shell shock,
and he was responding well until...

16:22.600 --> 16:25.400
Marvellous,
we're a wardrobe mistress short.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.040
Think you can double with
prompt, Barbara?

16:28.040 --> 16:31.200
Well, I'm not sure I'm qualified,
and it is Bridget.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.440
That's the spirit. You can
start by sorting this lot out.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.480
The police need to speak to us
about Scarlett.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.760
They're in the scene dock.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.080
Well, you don't think any of us
did it?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.480
I'm merely following up on some
loose ends.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.880
And as Miss Dreyfuss was last seen
alive in the theatre...

16:47.880 --> 16:50.160
Well, my husband will vouch for me.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.680
He most certainly can.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.000
Sir. Superintendent.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.680
At ease, lads.
It's plain Mr Sturgess now.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.200
I wasn't aware.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.960
This gorgeous creature's my wife.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.800
And how's retirement treating you,
sir... Mr Sturgess?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.119
As you see, she's roped me
in as Baron Hardup.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.560
And why all the interest in the
Dreyfuss case?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.200
A word in private.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.760
Should I say something?

17:17.760 --> 17:23.400
Say what, exactly? You will say
nothing to the police, Douglas.

17:25.640 --> 17:31.800
And we discovered he may have been
duped into signing it by DI Jones.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.120
Who is unfortunately deceased
and thus unable to defend himself.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.200
But, sir... It's a can of worms.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.120
You want the public thinking
we left a killer on the loose?

17:42.120 --> 17:46.360
I'd call that a catastrophic own
goal for community relations.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.800
Is that clear, son?

17:49.120 --> 17:51.080
Perfectly, Mr Sturgess.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.800
On the subject of which,
we're still short on cast,

17:53.800 --> 17:56.440
and I'm sure the public would
appreciate a police

17:56.440 --> 17:58.920
involvement in such
a community event.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.200
Happy to oblige, sir.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.800
Good man. Good men.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.800
Found you some volunteers, Pru...

18:07.480 --> 18:11.120
Lucky for you, I've no
intention of dropping anything.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.560
We can do some sniffing around.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.640
I'm sure we can manage seventh
and eighth villager.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.400
I'm sorry, sir.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.760
Oh, you will be, Sergeant.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.080
Oh, they're a lovely fit.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.280
Here are your scripts, and we'll see
you at rehearsals tomorrow.

18:28.280 --> 18:33.200
And when you're finished with those,
just hang them up on the rail.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.840
Will you help me out of my dress,
sir, please?

18:55.800 --> 18:59.720

three wishes?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.720
Ugh! Where did you find that?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.360
In one of the costume trunks.
Is something wrong?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.080
Prompt! Prompt!

19:23.080 --> 19:26.520
Who do you think I am?
The genie of the lamp?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.600
Is something wrong?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.480
That's Red Riding Hood's cloak.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.040
Dead woman's cloak.
She wore it on the day she died.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.680
Very well. One. But be careful what
you wish for, Buttons.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.600
The tree of truth hears everything.
Exit stage right. Lights down.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.480
Something to share, Mrs McCarthy?

19:41.480 --> 19:44.480
If she wouldn't be seen dead in
this, then I'm wondering why was

19:44.480 --> 19:46.720
her address found in the pocket?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.520
I think you're fibbing, Buttons.
Who is she?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.480
Oh, how wonderful!

19:56.480 --> 20:00.760
Oh, how wonderful, tickets for the
royal ball.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.160
Think of it as detention.
There might be something we missed.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.160
And it's more productive than
writing out 100 times,

20:11.160 --> 20:13.680
"I must not volunteer my superior
officer for the part

20:13.680 --> 20:15.760
"of Ugly Sister".

20:15.760 --> 20:20.480
Actually, sir, we did miss something
or rather, something's missing.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.680
Benny Clough made
deliveries near Scarlett's

20:22.680 --> 20:24.720
house on the evening in question.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.960
All were followed up
and statements taken.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.440
But there's one missing.
Made by a Peggy Semple.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.280
And she is?

20:33.280 --> 20:35.840
No idea, sir. There's no
record of her locally.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.920
You sure it isn't just misfiled?
No, sir.

20:39.680 --> 20:44.280
You can see where the
staple has been taken out

20:44.280 --> 20:46.240
and where it's been re-stapled.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.560
Quite the Dr Watson.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.840
Good luck, Buttons.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.880
Is there a girl you love, Buttons?

21:04.880 --> 21:05.920
No.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.240
Ow.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.440
There is! Is she someone I know?

21:14.480 --> 21:15.520
No.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.480
Ow.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.720
I think you're fibbing, Buttons.
Who is she?

21:22.880 --> 21:26.840
It's... it's...

21:26.840 --> 21:29.120
Vulgaria!

21:38.200 --> 21:41.280
What's the prognosis, Doctor?

21:41.280 --> 21:44.640
Sadly, I am a doctor of philosophy,
not medicine.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.720
I thought... your clinic...

21:46.720 --> 21:48.960
I practise psychodynamic therapy,

21:48.960 --> 21:53.080
focusing on psychological
functioning and change. Ah.

21:53.080 --> 21:59.680
But I can tell you he's in a deep
coma and not expected to wake up.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.160
Silly boy. It was his own fault.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.480
He was in charge of numbering
the ropes.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.160
but his head's been all over
the place since...

22:22.480 --> 22:24.480
Since Scarlett's body was
discovered.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.040
Forgive me for eavesdropping,
but I overheard him

22:28.040 --> 22:30.000
saying he wanted to
go to the police.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
The night Scarlett went missing...

22:37.480 --> 22:40.800
..he didn't come home after
leaving the theatre.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.480
Staggered back at dawn
covered in mud and leaves.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.720
Couldn't remember where he'd been or
what he'd done, but...

22:48.720 --> 22:52.000
..when Benny confessed,
I could see the relief in his eyes.

22:53.480 --> 22:57.040
And then the police started
questioning his conviction.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.360
Douglas was getting flashbacks to
the woods that night,

23:00.360 --> 23:02.200
and he was frightened.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.600
Of what he might remember?

23:03.600 --> 23:05.000
I wouldn't have blamed him.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.440
Douglas and Lizzie, his fiancee,
were made for each other.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.720
She was even prepared to
forgive his... blip with Scarlett.

23:15.640 --> 23:20.080
Idiot boy broke it off anyway.
"I'm not worthy."

23:21.960 --> 23:25.960
Now I wonder if it's because he
thought she'd be marrying a killer.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.680
I will pray for him.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.320
Shall I take this
back to the theatre?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.160
I expect they'll be needing it.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.520
Of course, Father.
The show must go on.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.000
How are you planning on getting
into heaven

23:57.000 --> 23:58.680
if you're scared of heights, Father?

23:58.680 --> 24:03.120
I'm sincerely hoping there's
an escalator. What can you see?

24:03.120 --> 24:06.360
They're all numbered and there's
a list on the blackboard.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.720
Line 3, apple bucket.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.800
Yeah, you were right, Father.
Up here it says eight.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.960
I wanted to ask if you recognise
the name Peggy Semple?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.720
She always gave me milk
and biscuits for the ride home.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.520
You made a delivery to her the night
Scarlett went missing.

24:37.080 --> 24:40.240
Not to Peggy - she's the maid.
To Miss Sturgess.

24:43.040 --> 24:47.720
Peggy Semple is the Sturgess' maid?

24:47.720 --> 24:52.640
I had the wrong prescription from
Dr Cornelius. She got angry.

24:53.640 --> 24:54.680
She hit me.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.160
Hey, you, wait.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.480
It's the wrong one.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.000
Well, this isn't mine!

25:03.640 --> 25:05.520
Where's mine? Hmm?

25:05.520 --> 25:07.600
Is it in there?

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
I ain't got anything else!

25:09.600 --> 25:13.480
There's no need to get in a tizz.
Let's get you inside,

25:13.480 --> 25:15.800
we can call the doctor
and sort it out.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.160
Thank you Benny.
That's very helpful.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.200
Does it mean I can go home?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.920
I'm working on it, son.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.040
Peggy left us years ago.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.000
Got married to a drayman from Largs

25:52.000 --> 25:54.920
and was off without
a by-your-leave.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.760
Do you recollect her account
of events on the evening that

25:57.760 --> 25:59.840
Scarlett Dreyfuss disappeared?

25:59.840 --> 26:02.440
Would you mind explaining
where this is leading?

26:02.440 --> 26:04.160
The statement is missing, sir.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.120
And for one thing, it could explain

26:06.120 --> 26:08.520
the scratches on Benny Clough's
face.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.720
I told you to stop flogging
that dead horse.

26:12.040 --> 26:17.400
With respect, that isn't your
prerogative any more, Mr Sturgess.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.960
Friendly warning, boys.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.120
I may be retired,
but one phone call from me

26:25.120 --> 26:29.520
and you'll both spend the rest
of your careers directing traffic.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.400
Do I make myself clear?

26:42.000 --> 26:48.080
♪ Good King Wenceslas looked out

26:48.080 --> 26:53.640

Now what, sir?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.960
You heard the man.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.240
Any more digging
and we'll be on traffic duty.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
There is something you could try.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.160
You mean someone.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.320
Think of it like Christmas Day
on the Somme.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.680
The German
and British football match.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.680
The German
and British football match.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.840
No-man's-land. Different sides,
but playing the same game.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.040
Then on Boxing Day, it's back to
knocking seven bells

27:19.040 --> 27:20.680
out of each other?

27:20.680 --> 27:21.760
Exactly.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.720
Lad seems barely older
than our John.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.960
Perhaps you can get on the
blower to him upstairs.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.760
Ask for a miracle and get him
home in time for Christmas.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.600
You only had to ask.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.600
Forgot my car keys.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.560
Did no-one teach you to knock?

28:08.560 --> 28:11.120
Oh, you wouldn't believe
the gaps in my education.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.800
Toodle-oo.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.640
I think Douglas saw
someone in the woods.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.400
And when his memory started
to return

28:31.400 --> 28:34.880
they tampered with the rope numbers
and...
HE SQUEALS

28:34.880 --> 28:36.400
Oh, Sidney. Sorry.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.320
And why did Scarlett have
Rose Marie's address in her pocket?

28:40.320 --> 28:43.760
Which leads us
back to the missing statement.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.200
Retired Superintendent Sturgess is
starting to look fishier than

28:47.200 --> 28:48.920
Billingsgate.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.320
What is he hiding?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.840
I think I might hazard a guess.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.240
Dandini, exit stage left.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.840
Left! And thank you, Hernia.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.560
Ooh, how wonderful.
Tickets for the royal ball.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.640
Yes, and I hear the Prince has
the largest balls in all the land.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.600
Ooh, you are a one.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.400
Can we have that a bit harder?

29:20.400 --> 29:22.960
Ooh, you are a one.

29:22.960 --> 29:27.040
Right, there's going to be a change
of cast. I'm Hernia. He's Vulgaria.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.720
If that's all right with you,
Sergeant?

29:29.720 --> 29:34.160
Now I suggest
we start from Dandidini leaving,

29:34.160 --> 29:37.720
giving me
the tickets for the ball, yes?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.120
Thank you, Prudence.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.120
Ooh, you are a one.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.120
Ow!

29:43.120 --> 29:46.120
Do that again and I'll...
I'll box your ears.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.120
You can't box.
Can she, boys and girls?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.960
ALL: Oh, yes, she can. Et cetera.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.120
Then pick up from Hernia,
"Show me, then."

29:57.040 --> 29:58.360
Show me, then.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.560
White heroin is my guess. You can't
get that on prescription.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.440
And that address label was identical

30:36.440 --> 30:38.400
to the one found in
Scarlett's cloak.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.440
Benny delivered nerve powders to
Scarlett. Yes, of course.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.120
Care to share it?

30:47.240 --> 30:50.360
Benny can't read.
He mixed up the prescriptions.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.080
Naughty Rose Marie.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.360
But this isn't mine.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.080
And Rose Marie got Scarlett's.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.280
Where's mine? Is it in there?

31:07.280 --> 31:08.760
I haven't got anything else.

31:10.440 --> 31:15.280
Cornelius isn't a physician.
He's a Doctor of Philosophy.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.560
So the good doctor supplies
Rose Marie with something rather

31:18.560 --> 31:20.520
more efficacious than nerve
powders.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.960
The Superintendent's junkie missus
in possession of illegal drugs.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.920
You can see why he'd
want to keep that quiet.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.280
It's all starting to make sense.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.440
Scarlett found out about

31:30.440 --> 31:32.960
Rose Marie's dirty little secret
and confronted her.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.040
He'd be ruined if it got out.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.440
That's one big motive for murder.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.480
Speculation, though.
You can't actually prove it.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.520
Which means we're back to
square one.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.080
There is a way. But we'll have to
wait till daylight.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.120
Hello.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.320
Well, then, is this our man?

32:00.360 --> 32:03.760
Hello, old chap. You
look like you've been in the wars.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.160
Does this look like nerve powder to
you?

32:14.120 --> 32:15.840
This is all very cloak-and-dagger.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.440
The tree of truth. I thought
it rather apt.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.080
Don't worry about another accident.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.560
Although why would you,
seeing as you planned it?

32:29.360 --> 32:32.720
I've heard you fancy yourself
as the local Miss Marple.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.880
Tell me why I would wish to harm
someone

32:35.880 --> 32:39.160
as inoffensive as poor Douglas?

32:39.160 --> 32:42.760
Because he was in the woods
the night Scarlett disappeared,

32:42.760 --> 32:45.200
and saw something he shouldn't.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.720
I take it you mean me. Fascinating.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.600
So in addition to the attempted
murder of Douglas, you are also

32:52.600 --> 32:54.760
accusing me of Scarlett's murder?

32:54.760 --> 32:56.680
No. Not at all.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.560
I think we both know
she died by her own hand.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.600
Pray go on.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.480
Benny mixed up the prescriptions.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.320
Rose Marie wasn't your only addict.

33:10.800 --> 33:15.400
I'm reliably informed that this is
cocaine - intended for Scarlett.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.280
But instead she received
something far more deadly.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.240
White heroin
intended for Rose Marie.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.600
Where did you find that?

33:25.600 --> 33:30.120
In Benny's saddlebag. He was
arrested before he could return it.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.760
Benny made deliveries
for the whole village.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.680
There's nothing to
connect that with me.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.280
And if the police questioned you,
you'd just deny it.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.040
And sue you for slander for good
measure.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.680
Some would argue that the right man
was punished for the crime.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.120
An interesting perspective.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.720
If Benny hadn't mixed up
the packages...

33:53.720 --> 33:56.360
Finally, someone with some sense.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.960
Idiot boy got what he deserved.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.480
Rose Marie alerted
you to the switch?

34:03.840 --> 34:08.199
Scarlett was vapid and greedy.
Wouldn't think to check what it was.

34:08.199 --> 34:12.280
And if she believed it to be cocaine
and inhaled it -

34:12.280 --> 34:14.040
the results would've been fatal.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.719
When she didn't answer her
telephone, I drove to her house.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.960
I knew it would be traced back to me
eventually.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.440
It seemed expedient to
dispose of the evidence.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.800
And that was when you saw Douglas?

34:48.280 --> 34:52.000
I could see he was in a fugue state
and would have no recollection.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.000
When the simpleton confessed,
it was karma.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.840
The gods' way of telling me
I wasn't to blame.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.480
Easier to let an innocent
go to jail.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.480
Feed him and keep him warm,
and I doubt he knows the difference.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.440
A being of no function to society,
whereas I...

35:10.440 --> 35:15.240
You are a common drug peddler.

35:15.240 --> 35:20.560
Condemning your victims to a long,
slow death of body and soul.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.360
Desperate wives in gilded cages.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.280
I give these women a reason to live.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.880
You give them a reason not to live.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.040
Dr Cornelius,

35:30.040 --> 35:34.240
an admission would be the first step
toward repentance and God's grace.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.520
Fascinating as this has been,

35:37.520 --> 35:40.720
my only concern is with earthly
repercussion.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.640
And as none of it can be proved,

35:43.640 --> 35:45.000
at least I'll escape that.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.760
Oh, no, you won't.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.720
Behind you.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.960
Did you get all that, Sergeant?

35:55.960 --> 35:57.800
Yes, sir, I did.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.280
Good. Eugene Cornelius...

36:00.280 --> 36:04.200
"..has been charged with attempted
murder, unlawful burial

36:04.200 --> 36:07.040
"and supply of illegal drugs."

36:07.040 --> 36:09.160
Oh, and Rose Marie's in front
of the bench,

36:09.160 --> 36:10.800
which is a five-minute wonder,

36:10.800 --> 36:13.040
but at least she's getting
treatment.

36:15.320 --> 36:19.160
The doctors say I should talk to him
in case he can hear me.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.840
I hope he can.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.640
I don't want him to die
thinking he was a murderer.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.280
Have you come to pray?

36:28.280 --> 36:30.400
Not on this occasion. No.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.960
Come in.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.520
Hello, Prudence.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.000
Hello, Douglas.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.720
Sometimes love is the most
powerful prayer.

37:04.440 --> 37:08.640
Fairy Godmother!
Has anyone seen Fairy Godmother?

37:08.640 --> 37:11.920
We've half an hour till curtain
and...

37:11.920 --> 37:13.720
I call that cutting it fine.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.320
Oh, nonsense. Stage fright.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.000
Honey and lemon will do the trick.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.640
Disaster. We can't do Cinderella
without a fairy godmother!

37:30.800 --> 37:33.240
Who the blazes is Bridget?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.560
I am. She is.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.160
I can't possibly.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.280
But I have nothing to wear.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.760
BANG
THEY GASP

38:00.760 --> 38:05.040
Welcome, good folk one and all.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.880
Let me be your guiding hand,

38:07.880 --> 38:11.640
and lead you through this magic
land.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
Phew, sis, that was close!

38:22.320 --> 38:25.640
AUDIENCE: It's behind you!

38:25.640 --> 38:27.680
It's what, sorry?

38:30.600 --> 38:31.640
Aargh!

38:36.600 --> 38:39.040
Ow! You do that again
and I'll box your ears.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.160
You can't box.
Can she, boys and girls?

38:42.160 --> 38:43.680
ALL: Oh, yes, she can!

38:43.680 --> 38:45.120
Oh, no, she can't.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.120
ALL: Oh, yes, she can!

38:47.120 --> 38:48.360
Oh, no, she can't.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.880
ALL: Oh, yes, she can!

38:50.880 --> 38:52.720
Right, come on, show me, then.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.600
You said go left,
you always go left!

39:10.520 --> 39:12.120
Mice medley, go! That's it.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.480
Right to the other side of the
stage.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.400
Good news. Benny's being released -
he'll be home tomorrow.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.280
On Christmas Eve. How mirac...

39:30.600 --> 39:33.240
Back on your feet, Hernia!
You've got the ballroom!

39:33.240 --> 39:36.200
Not in this corset, I haven't.
Come on, sir, up you get.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.080
Laryngitis?
I suppose you felt sorry for me.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.400
Well, I do not need your pity.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.880
Oh, typical. It's all about you.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.160
Well, you knew that I was worse
than Pontius Pilate,

39:49.160 --> 39:51.480
but you would have let me go out
there

39:51.480 --> 39:53.040
to the ruin of my reputation!

39:53.040 --> 39:57.080
Yes. I mean, no.
you were making a great improvement.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.440
Fairy Godmother!
Transformation scene!

39:59.440 --> 40:02.920
Ask yourself this -
what would my aunt say?

40:02.920 --> 40:04.560
Chop, chop, Barbara!

40:10.040 --> 40:11.600
Nice work, Penelope.

40:14.080 --> 40:18.640
Cinderella. You shall go to the
ball.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.720
Let me fit my foot
in the crystal slipper.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.560
You couldn't fit your foot
in Crystal Palace!

40:34.440 --> 40:37.440
My gift to you of joy and laughter,

40:37.440 --> 40:40.320
as you live happily ever after.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.600
Mum?

41:41.040 --> 41:44.000
Oh, it's so good to have you home!

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
I'm sorry I lied.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
It just wasn't Christmas on my own.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.960
But next year, I promise we'll make
it the best one ever.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.680
Yeah, next year. The best one ever!

42:16.640 --> 42:18.120
Merry Christmas, Mrs Clough.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.600
Do you mind moving aside?
This thing's damn heavy.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.440
Merry Christmas!

42:22.440 --> 42:25.840
We thought you could do with
a transfusion of Christmas cheer.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.280
One turkey, fully prepared.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.880
So all you have to do is pop
it in the oven tomorrow.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.360
Merry Christmas!

42:32.360 --> 42:33.880
Merry Christmas!
