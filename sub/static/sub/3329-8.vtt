WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.989
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

00:12.280 --> 00:15.306
HOLMES:
My mind rebels at stagnation.

00:15.340 --> 00:19.276
Give me, uh, give me problems,
give me work, give me, uh,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.642
the most abstruse cryptogram
or the most intricate analysis,

00:22.690 --> 00:26.319
and I'm in
my very own atmosphere.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.829
I can dispense with old cravings
and bad habits, but, uh,

00:31.860 --> 00:34.795
I abhor the dull routine
of eXIstence.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.291
(quiet chatter)

00:41.770 --> 00:44.330
That was nice,
what you said tonight.

00:44.370 --> 00:47.601
Yeah, it was a fact.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.270
It's all new to me, but, uh,
it's helping, you know?

00:52.320 --> 00:56.211
Right. Well, um, uh,
m-meetings are important,

00:56.250 --> 00:59.310
especially in the beginning,
so...

00:59.360 --> 01:01.385
I-If you're in need
of a sponsor...

01:01.420 --> 01:02.785
No, I'm set, thanks.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.758
Sorry, but I got to ask.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.427
Is BrainAttic yours?

01:08.460 --> 01:09.666
Excuse me?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.327
The blog?

01:11.370 --> 01:13.736
Or Tumblr or whatever they call
those things?

01:13.770 --> 01:15.328
A buddy turned me on to it.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.237
There's advice there,
thoughts about recovery.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.670
The guy who runs it
is anonymous,

01:20.710 --> 01:22.871
but the way he writes
sort of sounds like you.

01:22.910 --> 01:24.275
"Brain Attic"?

01:24.310 --> 01:25.800
One word.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.709
If it's not you,
you should check it out.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.581
Some of the quotes,

01:32.620 --> 01:35.509
I think they'd really
speak to you.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.551
(phone ringing)

01:40.300 --> 01:41.528
Captain?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.391
GREGSON:
Victim is Alec Flynn.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.796
NYPD, seven years
on the job.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.367
Three weeks ago, he transferred
to Highway Patrol.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.300
Before that,
he was assigned

01:50.340 --> 01:53.468
to the Training Bureau
out on Rodman's Neck.

01:53.510 --> 01:56.741
Best we can tell from the
dashboard camera footage

01:56.780 --> 01:59.271
is he was ambushed.

01:59.320 --> 02:03.142
A masked shooter came up
behind him, fired,

02:03.190 --> 02:05.488
and then took off in a_car
driven by an accomplice.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.715
Flynn didn't even have time
to draw his weapon.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.421
Suspects?

02:09.460 --> 02:11.223
I got a call
into his lieutenant,

02:11.260 --> 02:13.455
but if it isn't someone
he locked horns with...

02:13.500 --> 02:15.695
You think this
might have been random?

02:15.730 --> 02:17.789
Wouldn't be the first time
a psychopath

02:17.830 --> 02:19.832
decided to target a cop.

02:19.870 --> 02:23.362
Needless to say, this one
is all hands on deck.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.399
BELL:
Captain?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.469
We got a fresh footprint,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.374
size 12 work boots.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.342
That's not Flynn's.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.484
Well, if you look closely,
there are fibers

02:39.520 --> 02:41.681
in some of the grooves.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.779
They could've transferred
from the killer's boot.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.527
HOLMES:
Excuse me.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.369
Hello. I'm just...

02:49.400 --> 02:50.367
I'm just gonna draw

02:50.400 --> 02:52.288
Officer Flynn's sidearm.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.389
So don't be alarmed.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.515
GREGSON:
What is it?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.516
Those are air gun pellets.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.686
You said Officer Flynn

03:15.720 --> 03:17.381
didn't have time
to draw his weapon.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.579
If he had,
it would've been utterly futile,

03:18.630 --> 03:21.497
because he's armed
WIth a toy gun.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.737
KITTY:
No plates on the car.

04:02.770 --> 04:03.862
Stolen, I bet.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.731
You can't see the driver at all.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.771
It's time for
the final call.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.521
(radio static crackling)

04:30.030 --> 04:33.033
DISPATCHER:
Central to Officer 73199.

04:36.470 --> 04:39.473
Central to Officer 73199.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.672
Officer Alec Flynn,
please respond.

04:47.050 --> 04:50.383
Central to Officer 73199.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.656
Officer 73199, no response.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.750
Officer 73199,

05:00.800 --> 05:04.019
Alec Flynn, is End of Watch.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.095
He has gone home
for the final time.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.563
(radio static ends)

05:14.580 --> 05:18.949
Front desk has mourning bands,
if anyone needs them.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.538
(clears throat)

05:20.580 --> 05:22.741
_Ceremoni_al unit
IS taking Sign ups

05:22.790 --> 05:25.611
for Honor Guards
at Officer Flynn's coffin

05:25.650 --> 05:27.789
and radio cars
at his resrdence.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.959
_There will be
a full Inspector's funeral,

05:29.990 --> 05:32.458
date and time to be announced.
Any questions?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.722
Until we know that there
isn't someone out there

05:36.770 --> 05:39.591
hunting cops, we play it safe.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.633
No one works alone,
and no cowboy nonsense.

05:43.670 --> 05:47.606
But rest assured,
we will get the person

05:47.640 --> 05:49.801
who did this.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.670
As you were.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.888
Marcus is gonna go

05:58.920 --> 06:01.411
talk to the wife,
if any of you want to join him.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.620
She a suspect?

06:02.660 --> 06:03.979
She's the wife.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.679
We have to at least
ask questions,

06:05.730 --> 06:06.992
but we'll tread lightly.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.554
I'll go with you;
you guys can stay

06:08.600 --> 06:10.966
and review the video.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.889
Suspect is
approximately six-foot-two,

06:13.940 --> 06:15.635
190 pounds, right-handed,

06:15.670 --> 06:17.661
and extremely comfortable
with ﬁrearms.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.836
I know.
I watched the video, too.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.679
KI'I'I'Y:_
So you noticed

06:20.710 --> 06:22.678
that the shooter never
touched Flynn's pistol.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.804
No one disturbed the body
until after the police arrived.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.579
Meaning the firearm
must have been replaced

06:27.620 --> 06:29.713
sometime before the attack.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.980
Someone didn't want
Officer Flynn

06:32.020 --> 06:33.681
to be able to protect himself.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.585
Unfortunately,
the most likely timing

06:35.620 --> 06:37.724
for the switch is also
the most disturbing.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.749
As we know,
many uniformed officers

06:38.790 --> 06:40.155
keep their service pistols

06:40.200 --> 06:42.896
in their lockers
when they're not on duty,

06:42.930 --> 06:44.818
suggesting that the people
with easiest access

06:44.870 --> 06:47.759
to Officer Flynn's pistol
were his fellow police.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.062
Yeah.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.102
I'm ahead of you
on that one, too.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.607
Alec was my partner.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.844
GREGSON:
He was,

06:57.880 --> 06:59.939
but then 18 months ago,

06:59.980 --> 07:03.518
you blew through a red light
and totaled your radio car.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.087
Flynn hurt his
neck and back.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.451
We were responding to a call.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.718
The driver of the car

07:08.760 --> 07:10.079
that hit you sued
the department,

07:10.130 --> 07:13.122
and in discovery,
Flynn testified against you.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.027
Your own partner.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.697
I didn't swap out his gun,

07:18.730 --> 07:20.459
and I sure as hell
didn't kill him.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.660
HOLMES: You must have
been angry with him

07:21.700 --> 07:23.668
for failing to stand by you.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.701
You were, after all,
brothers in blue.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.833
Perhaps you no longer
saw him as a real cop.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.646
Perhaps it was less than fitting
that he should carry a real gun.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.547
I may never have made detective,
but I know how this works, okay?

07:34.580 --> 07:37.640
You ask someone in to talk,
you're gonna sweat them.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.555
My union rep
tore me a new one

07:39.590 --> 07:40.784
when I wouldn't let him
send a lavwer,

07:40.820 --> 07:42.583
but I told him,
"Let them sweat me."

07:42.630 --> 07:43.722
Sooner you guys ask
your questions,

07:43.760 --> 07:45.159
the sooner I'm cleared.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.658
At the time of the
shooting, you were...

07:47.700 --> 07:49.497
At Abe's, playing darts.

07:49.530 --> 07:50.827
That's a cop bar.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.735
I got two dozen police
who'll vouch for me.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.533
You could've switched
the pistol anytime.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.667
Contracted the killing.

07:58.710 --> 08:01.508
Flynn was working
out of Highway Unit 7

08:01.540 --> 08:03.041
up in Fleetwood, right?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.638
Check your records.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.908
Pull the security tape.

08:05.950 --> 08:09.681
I haven't set foot
in that building in years.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.813
You got any more
questions or not?

08:11.850 --> 08:13.579
You in a hurry, Officer?

08:13.620 --> 08:16.111
All due respect, Captain, yeah.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.752
Iam.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.849
I had my problems
with Flynn,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.754
but he was a cop,
and I don't want anyone thinking

08:21.800 --> 08:23.529
what you're thinking right now.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.629
I want to_ be able
to go to his funeral;

08:25.670 --> 08:29.128
I want to be able_ _
to pay my respects to his Wife.

08:29.170 --> 08:33.106
So, please, whatever you want
to throw at me, throw it.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.279
I'm not your guy.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.800
WOMAN:
The last couple of years

08:36.850 --> 08:38.841
were tough for Alec.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.748
He was active,
you know, a gym rat.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.543
He played on the
department's football team.

08:45.590 --> 08:49.082
Then, after
the accident...

08:49.120 --> 08:52.089
he hated physical therapy.

08:52.130 --> 08:56.021
And working at the shooting
range on Rodman's Neck,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.961
he said he didn't feel like
a real cop anymore.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.209
Returning to full duty,
that was a big deal to him.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.573
He was very proud.

09:06.610 --> 09:08.339
I couldn't help but notice

09:08.380 --> 09:10.575
that you changed
your locks recently.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.113
I-I lost my keys.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.015
Did you lose your TV, too?

09:15.050 --> 09:16.938
Your engagement ring,

09:16.990 --> 09:19.015
your wedding band?
What is this?

09:19.050 --> 09:21.780
Before I worked with the police,
I was a sober companion.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.754
I worked
with recovering addicts.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.758
I've been in homes
like this one.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.953
I have talked
to spouses like you.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.931
The photographs on your mantle--

09:32.970 --> 09:35.939
Alec lost a lot of weight
since the accident.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.198
A lot of muscle mass.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.060
It could be
he couldn't exercise

09:39.110 --> 09:42.648
the same way
that he used to, or...

09:42.680 --> 09:44.341
maybe it was something else.

09:46.350 --> 09:49.683
The doctor gave him Ow
for the pain.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.689
He got hooked.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.756
You kicked him out?

09:54.790 --> 09:59.284
He was stealing things,
trading them for more pills.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.389
I-I had to.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.762
Mrs. Flynn,

10:03.800 --> 10:06.394
did you have anything to do
with what happened last night?

10:06.430 --> 10:09.934
Alec came to me
a couple of weeks ago.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.771
He said he was clean.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.903
That it hadn't been
easy, but he quit

10:15.940 --> 10:18.340
cold turkey.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.416
We started seeing a therapist.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.942
I even gave him the keys
to the new locks,

10:23.990 --> 10:26.857
said he could use it
when he wanted to come home.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.414
(sniffles)

10:28.460 --> 10:30.826
My Alec was back.

10:30.860 --> 10:32.953
Was there anyone he might
have been in trouble with?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.854
A dealer, maybe?

10:37.070 --> 10:41.894
I saw a-a text once,
before I knew what was going on.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.158
It was weird, just numbers.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.968
"100," then "4," then "1,000."

10:49.010 --> 10:50.944
100 pills for $1,000.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.970
You remember who sent it?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.909
The text ID. was
just another number.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.941
It said "6."

10:58.990 --> 11:00.981
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

11:02.790 --> 11:04.052
I don't think she was a part

11:04.090 --> 11:05.887
of what happened
last night, do you?

11:05.930 --> 11:07.898
The department will poke
around a little more,

11:07.930 --> 11:09.761
make sure she didn't
cut any big checks

11:09.800 --> 11:10.960
to potential hit
men recently.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.991
But, nah, I
don't see it.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.806
I'm more interested in
running down this "Six" guy.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.864
That's the same
type of pellet gun

11:17.910 --> 11:19.309
that was in_
Flynn's holster, right?

11:19.340 --> 11:21.274
Yeah. I remember that
realistic ones like this

11:21.310 --> 11:23.244
were outlawed in New York
a long time ago.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.804
Yep. 1998.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.114
But you can still
buy them in New Jersey.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.970
You know what?
You look into the "Six" guy,

11:29.020 --> 11:30.840
I will call around
to stores and see

11:30.890 --> 11:33.450
if anyone remembers selling
this particular brand.

11:33.490 --> 11:34.957
Maybe we'll get luclq,

11:34.990 --> 11:37.959
find the guy who
planted one on Flynn.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.218
KITTY:
Sherlock?

11:39.260 --> 11:42.093
In the study.

11:42.130 --> 11:45.429
I think I found something.

11:45.470 --> 11:46.869
I was mucking about

11:46.900 --> 11:47.992
with some of
your software.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.769
I was trying to
enhance the video.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.402
Thought ifI could zoom in
on the shooter's eyes,

11:51.440 --> 11:53.237
I might be able
to determine the color.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.329
But it was too dark,
and the resolution was too low.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.847
Except. . .

11:59.820 --> 12:01.014
Do you see it?
The left eye?

12:01.050 --> 12:02.779
See how it reflects
the light?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.038
It's glass.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.309
The man who killed Flynn
is six-foot-two, 14 stone,

12:08.360 --> 12:10.089
and has a glass eye.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.451
Should help narrow down
the candidates, no?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.424
I thought you'd be happy.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.031
I am. Disappointed I didn't
see the glass myself.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.935
I can't make my own discoveries
every now and again?

12:22.970 --> 12:24.062
Of course you can.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.101
Then what's the problem?

12:28.440 --> 12:30.772
"You see, but you
do not observe.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.107
The distinction
is clear."

12:32.150 --> 12:34.118
"It is stupidity
rather than courage

12:34.150 --> 12:36.448
to refuse to recognize danger
when it is close upon you."

12:36.480 --> 12:37.913
What is all this?

12:37.950 --> 12:40.510
It, Kitty, is me.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.016
Didn't know you were
that into birds.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.255
The blog is not mine,
but the quotes are.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.895
I might not be cited,
but they're taken from things

12:46.930 --> 12:48.989
that I've said in meetings.

12:49.030 --> 12:53.137
Someone's been writing down what
you say and posting it here?

12:53.170 --> 12:54.467
Mm.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.058
That's against the rules,
isn't it?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.068
It would appear that
the thief's intention

12:58.110 --> 12:59.805
is to help other addicts.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.137
They think that
the things that I've said

13:01.180 --> 13:03.341
can be applied
to others' quests for sobriety.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.008
I support the premise,
but not the practice.

13:06.050 --> 13:09.440
Anonymity is
a cornerstone of the program.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.187
You are very quotable, you know.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.881
A facility for quotation

13:15.560 --> 13:17.551
You just did it again.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.528
I'll settle it.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.822
and I'll tell them to stop.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.064
No, you won't.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.192
A policeman's been killed.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.935
You can't be distracted.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.234
I am just the protg.
I'll settle it.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.330
(phone ringing)

13:34.380 --> 13:35.904
Watson?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.578
WATSON: I found something
you need to see.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.976
Can I come over?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.117
I called a bunch of
shops in New Jersey

13:46.150 --> 13:47.515
that sell airsoft guns.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.118
Now, no one remembers
any specific

13:49.160 --> 13:50.980
sales of that kind of gun

13:51.030 --> 13:52.349
that wound up
in Flynn's holster,

13:52.390 --> 13:54.358
but they all gave me
their security footage

13:54.400 --> 13:55.628
from the last couple of months.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.218
There must be hundreds of hours.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.192
Thousands.
I got lucky.

13:59.230 --> 14:03.007
I found what I was looking
for on the very first try.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.166
HOLMES:
That's the man

14:06.210 --> 14:07.336
you think bought the gun?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.837
Yes. And that's the problem.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.178
That's Officer Flynn.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.643
The killer didn't
replace the gun.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.043
He did it himself.

14:27.230 --> 14:29.027
Doesn't make any sense.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.492
replace his own gun with a toy?

14:31.530 --> 14:33.964
As you know, it's not uncommon
for opioid addicts

14:34.000 --> 14:36.298
to spend thousands of dollars
a week on pills.

14:36.340 --> 14:39.264
Or, roughly, the entire weekly
salary of an NYPD patrolman.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.131
Flynn sold everything he had
to fuel his addiction.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.205
His wife's jewelry,
his TV, his computer...

14:44.250 --> 14:46.138
We believe that, finally,
he reached the point

14:46.180 --> 14:48.216
where his only possession
of any value

14:48.250 --> 14:49.672
was his service pistol.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.349
So he sells his Glock,
then he gets clean.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.119
He's called back
to full duty,

14:55.160 --> 14:56.616
but_ he doesn't have
a Sidearm anymore,

14:56.660 --> 14:58.321
or the money
to buy one.

14:58.360 --> 15:02.126
So he buys a replica
to make it look like he's armed

15:02.160 --> 15:05.266
and prays he's not
gonna have to use it?

15:05.300 --> 15:07.689
As appalling as
that scenario sounds,

15:07.740 --> 15:10.459
we believe the actual
chain of events is worse.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.262
When I spotted Flynn
buying a fake gun

15:12.310 --> 15:14.232
on the very first tape I
checked, I thought it was luck.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.134
Only, I don't believe in luck.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.977
A more
thorough search

15:18.010 --> 15:19.375
revealed that he'd purchased

15:19.410 --> 15:21.446
more than two dozen replicas
at different stores

15:21.480 --> 15:23.118
over a span of several weeks.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.141
It didn't make any sense,
until we remembered

15:25.190 --> 15:27.556
where he was working
while he was on light duty.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.150
Rodman's Neck.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.953
The armory.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.150
He would've had access
to hundreds of weapons.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.963
No cop wants to die,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.991
but they know if it happens
in the line of duty,

15:39.030 --> 15:41.169
the department will
do right by them.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.260
An inspector's funeral,
full honors,

15:44.310 --> 15:47.632
thousands of cops
lining the streets.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.136
_ I'll call for
an inventory at the range.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.148
If you're right,
Flynn was a traitor.

15:51.180 --> 15:53.341
He put our guns
in the hands of criminals.

15:53.380 --> 15:57.316
And it was probably one of
his associates who killed him.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.318
Funeral will be canceled.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.159
Whatever the case may be,

16:01.190 --> 16:04.227
Officer Flynn is no less
a homicide victim.

16:04.260 --> 16:07.320
We'll keep you apprised of
our search for the one-eyed man.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.724
Let's hope he's not a cop, too.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.169
I don't get it.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.565
What does birding have to do

16:14.600 --> 16:16.761
with staying off drugs?
Not a clue.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.404
That's why I contacted you.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.601
I want to find out
who manages this page.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.403
I know that you lead
bird-watching tours here.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.078
From what I can tell,

16:24.110 --> 16:25.407
this is where most of
the pictures were taken.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.179
Ooh, this is nice.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.619
Kentuclq Warbler.

16:28.650 --> 16:30.208
You don't see many of these.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.717
Any guesses as to who took it?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.149
Most of these are
common speCIes.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.259
When the rare
birds show up,

16:34.290 --> 16:35.359
everyone flocks
here for pictures.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.756
So nothing to nail down

16:37.790 --> 16:39.621
a specific place or date?

16:41.160 --> 16:42.195
Wait.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.289
This one.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.264
Quiscalus quiscula.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.528
A plague of grackle.

16:47.570 --> 16:50.061
These are grackles.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.237
They only congregate in
large groups like this

16:52.270 --> 16:53.578
when they migrate.

16:53.610 --> 16:56.078
A plague only stays in one place
for a day or two.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.544
This would have been taken
just north of the boathouse

16:58.580 --> 17:01.140
on either September 17 or 18.

17:01.180 --> 17:04.479
Um, do you remember
seeing anyone taking pictures?

17:04.520 --> 17:08.058
Every birder in New York
stopped by at some point.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.318
They all took
pictures.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.282
I took quite
a few myself.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.798
Sorry I couldn't
be more help.

17:13.830 --> 17:16.492
Any chance I could look
at your pictures?

17:20.100 --> 17:22.068
Where were you?

17:22.100 --> 17:23.704
Errand.

17:23.740 --> 17:26.106
You and Watson went
to talk to the captain.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.334
Not like there
was anything left

17:27.380 --> 17:29.177
to glean from the
dashboard video.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.472
Watson proposed
a division of labor

17:30.510 --> 17:32.102
while we were at the station.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.344
She and Detective Bell
will attempt to identify

17:33.380 --> 17:35.245
the man with the glass eye;

17:35.280 --> 17:38.579
you and I will look for a dealer
with the street name "6."

17:38.620 --> 17:39.746
Flynn's dealer.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.189
He and the shooter

17:41.220 --> 17:43.085
may be one and the same.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.849
We were right about the armory
at Rodman's Neck, by the way.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.597
Captain Gregson confirmed
no fewer than 30 weapons

17:48.630 --> 17:50.291
had been replaced with fakes.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.592
I was sort of hoping
we'd be wrong.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.131
As was I.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.398
But I know from experience

17:54.440 --> 17:55.737
when one is desperate for a fix,

17:55.770 --> 17:58.261
ethics and logic provide
little impediment to need.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.335
Yes, well...

18:00.380 --> 18:03.474
speaking of your
experience...

18:05.350 --> 18:07.341
I'm pretty sure
that these were taken

18:07.380 --> 18:09.439
on the same day as
one of the pictures

18:09.480 --> 18:10.640
from the BrainAttic
Web site.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.681
This is your idea
of not distracting me?

18:12.720 --> 18:15.689
I'm a member of a group,
too, now, remember?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.654
Decided I don't like

18:17.690 --> 18:19.419
what this_BrainAttic
person is domg,

18:19.460 --> 18:21.325
especially if it's
bothering you.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.193
Thought you could take a look,
see if you recognize anyone.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.505
So?

18:39.550 --> 18:42.144
So what?
Does anyone
look familiar?

18:42.180 --> 18:43.818
Supposing someone does.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.239
He or she may have not
protected my anonymity,

18:46.290 --> 18:48.554
but I will not do him or her
the same discourtesy.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.148
If there are
corrective measures

18:50.190 --> 18:51.521
to be taken,
I shall take them myself.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.527
But I've...

18:52.560 --> 18:53.697
I shall take them myself.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.391
(phone chimes)

18:59.530 --> 19:02.169
Detective Bell invites us
to a briefing by the ATF.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.169
He thinks they may have
identified the one-eyed man.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.531
HERNAN:
Niko Buros. He's a gunrunner.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.400
Operates out of
greater New York.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.408
He lost his left eye

19:11.450 --> 19:13.179
in a shoot-out with
a rival a few years ago.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.744
The height and weight
are both right.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.872
Given everything
you've uncovered

19:15.920 --> 19:17.182
about the officer
that was killed,

19:17.220 --> 19:18.744
I got to think
he's your guy.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.951
Buros acquires guns
in the States, then sells them

19:20.990 --> 19:22.412
to the Zeta cartel
in MeXIco.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.429
Specifically, a cell
operating out of Veracruz.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.758
Buros supplies them with
guns and, in exchange,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.428
they provide him with drugs,
which he then sells in the US.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.495
So he exports violence
and imports misery.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.929
Guy's got serious street cred.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.631
He maintains it
by doing his own dirty work.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.535
ATF and DEA have been
after him for years.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.367
Last month,
we thought we had him.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.378
We got a tip
that he was operating

19:41.410 --> 19:43.503
out of a warehouse in Queens.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.542
We raided the place, captured
almost a thousand weapons,

19:46.580 --> 19:47.911
arrest_ed some of
his crew.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.214
Unfortunately,
none of them are talking.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.741
And_there's no evidence
connecting Buros to that scene.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.382
HOLMES:
You think Flynn

19:54.420 --> 19:56.479
was selling
his pilfered guns to Buros.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.919
This man is a bulk seller.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.224
Why would 30-odd pistols
be worth his time?

20:00.260 --> 20:02.854
The murdered cop, Flynn,
he was a drug addict, right?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.395
Buros would have gotten those
for a song.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.829
All I know is

20:07.870 --> 20:09.599
your investigation
may be our best chance

20:09.640 --> 20:12.336
to tie him to something
that actually sticks, so...

20:12.370 --> 20:15.578
whatever you need,
ATF is at your disposal.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.668
So Flynn needs money to
keep himself in pills.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.575
After he sells
all his own stuff,

20:21.620 --> 20:23.508
he starts dipping into the
armory at Rodman's Neck,

20:23.550 --> 20:25.484
sells what he takes to Buros.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.488
Only, then he gets clean.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.556
And then he tells Buros
the deal is off.

20:29.590 --> 20:30.887
Buros kills him
out of anger.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.784
Or to tie up loose ends.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.526
It all makes sense, it just
doesn't help us locate Buros.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.721
"6." Flynn's dealer.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.795
He's the most likely
connection between

20:39.830 --> 20:42.663
an international gunrunner and
a druggie policeman, is he not?

20:42.700 --> 20:43.837
KITTY:
Too bad Six is

20:43.870 --> 20:45.565
a name no one
seems to recognize.

20:45.610 --> 20:46.736
We'll keep running it down.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.476
There's a BOLO out on Buros

20:48.510 --> 20:50.899
and patrols in the areas
he's been known to frequent.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.578
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get luclq.

20:55.550 --> 20:56.619
Half-caff, okay?

20:56.650 --> 20:57.912
Last time, I was
up all night.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.448
(computer beeps)

21:08.830 --> 21:10.969
MAN:
Excuse me. Officer?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.991
(silenced gunshots)

21:32.690 --> 21:33.657
We're sure it was Buros.

21:33.690 --> 21:34.657
Preliminary ballistics says

21:34.690 --> 21:36.555
it was the same gun.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.057
We also got a partial print

21:38.090 --> 21:39.557
off one of the shell casings.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.898
And just for
good measure,

21:40.930 --> 21:42.488
CSU found a few
more white threads,

21:42.530 --> 21:44.862
just like the ones from
that boot print at the scene

21:44.900 --> 21:47.027
of Flynn's murder.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.664
Lab says it's a blown polyester
fiber, the kind you'd find in

21:49.700 --> 21:53.409
hypoallergenic pillows, stuffed
animals, winter coat lining.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.829
We know it's him. We just
don't know why he's doing this.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.405
Well, maybe it's like
you said last night.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.042
He's declaring war
on the department.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.742
No, I think the ATF agent
was right.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.589
Buros was buying Flynn's guns,

22:04.620 --> 22:06.383
and something went south
between them.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.352
So you're wondering
if Ofﬁcer Hatem

22:07.390 --> 22:08.982
had something to do with it.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.124
After everything that happened
last couple of days,

22:11.160 --> 22:12.855
we got to at least consider it.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.029
If he was involved,

22:15.060 --> 22:16.823
the department is busy prepping

22:16.860 --> 22:20.023
another inspector's funeral
for another dirty cop.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.038
Obviously we got
to find Buros.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.709
But the funeral prep
isn't helping.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.605
I mean, everyone's
partnering up again,

22:26.640 --> 22:29.370
the vigils are back on.
We're stretched thin.

22:29.410 --> 22:31.549
At least the family's
pushing for a quick burial.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.411
If you want, I can stay
and help you find

22:33.450 --> 22:34.542
a connection
between Hatem and Flynn.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.717
Assuming there is one.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.388
For the sake of Hatem's family,

22:37.420 --> 22:39.388
I hope there isn't.

22:49.930 --> 22:51.727
Daren?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.067
Yeah, hi. Iwas
hoping we might, um,

22:55.100 --> 22:56.636
just have a chat?

22:56.670 --> 22:58.809
It's Sherlock, right?

22:58.840 --> 23:01.968
You, uh, you usually
come to the late meeting.

23:02.010 --> 23:05.104
Yeah, well, when the mood takes
me, I come to this one as well.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.175
Remember seeing you
here a few times.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.075
Yeah, well, we should...
we should probably head in

23:09.120 --> 23:10.747
before all the donuts are gone.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.644
"Brain Attic."

23:14.620 --> 23:17.111
Something I once shared
with the group.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.583
My personal theory on how
the brain is like an attic.

23:19.630 --> 23:22.451
It should not be cluttered
with useless facts.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.765
If memory serves, I was sharing
how it pertained to my sobriety

23:25.800 --> 23:27.734
and how my fears and
failures were things

23:27.770 --> 23:29.795
to be put to one side.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.137
I'd like you to take it down.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.569
Take down what?

23:34.610 --> 23:36.009
The page that you maintain.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.907
The one you've plastered
with my thoughts.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.679
You're different.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.676
You get that, right?

23:42.720 --> 23:44.142
The things you say here...

23:44.190 --> 23:46.750
You have this way
of looking at things...

23:46.790 --> 23:48.485
I'm a drug addict, Daren.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.948
My thoughts on sobriety are

23:50.990 --> 23:52.685
no more remarkable
than your own.

23:54.230 --> 23:57.620
A few months ago,
I came this close to using.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.764
My mom had just passed away,
and H kept telling myself

24:00.800 --> 24:03.166
I just need this now.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.033
This one time
I deserve this.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.708
But then, out of nowhere,

24:07.740 --> 24:10.948
I remembered something
you said about staying clean.

24:10.980 --> 24:14.245
"I must never make exceptions.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.578
An exception
disproves the rule."

24:16.620 --> 24:19.009
And then I started remembering
other things you said,

24:19.050 --> 24:22.178
and... I don't know, I...
I didn't need the drugs anymore.

24:22.220 --> 24:25.553
I could see clearly,
and it was all thanks to you.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.524
Well, I appreciate that.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.198
But nevertheless...

24:29.230 --> 24:31.698
It's not just me. People go
to BrainAttic every day.

24:31.730 --> 24:34.062
They-they leave comments.
It's helping them.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.931
I'd still like you to
take it down, Daren.

24:35.970 --> 24:37.767
Why?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.732
These meetings were
very difficult

24:39.770 --> 24:41.271
for me in the beginning.

24:41.310 --> 24:45.269
I'm not a man prone
to sharing my secrets.

24:45.310 --> 24:48.871
I was very, very skeptical
that what was shared here

24:48.920 --> 24:51.582
would stay here.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.714
But over time, I saw
how useful it could be.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.785
I grew comfortable.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.822
And I got better.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.518
I need it, Daren.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.664
The anonymity.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.965
I need to know that
these rooms are a vault.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.831
Without it,

25:09.870 --> 25:12.634
well, I fear I would no longer
be able to attend the meetings.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.274
Without the meetings...

25:14.310 --> 25:16.175
BrainAttic can help people.

25:16.210 --> 25:19.247
I... I'm keeping it.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.611
(door closes)

25:29.590 --> 25:32.320
Your wife, does she know
about the affair?

25:32.360 --> 25:33.156
What?

25:33.190 --> 25:36.057
The affair.
I know about it. Does she?

25:36.100 --> 25:37.727
You might recall

25:37.770 --> 25:40.068
from my shares
that I'm quite observant.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.193
In actual fact, when I'm in
these hallowed environs,

25:42.240 --> 25:44.105
I deliberately
tamp down my abilities

25:44.140 --> 25:46.108
so as not to violate
my fellows' privacy.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.005
It just doesn't seem
fair to me, you see.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.770
Knowing more about them than
they've chosen to volunteer.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.949
I'm not having an affair.

25:52.980 --> 25:55.039
Judging by the flush
on your face and the tang

25:55.080 --> 25:57.071
on your breath, you took the
anti-impotence drug Sildenafil

25:57.120 --> 25:58.917
sometime in the last two hours.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.282
The fresh chaﬁng
on your ring finger indicates

26:01.320 --> 26:02.912
that you removed and then
replaced your wedding ring

26:02.960 --> 26:04.655
in the same time frame.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.989
I can also detect the scent
of two perfumes on your skin.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.828
So, tell me, Daren,
ifI was to make an appearance

26:10.870 --> 26:12.667
at your home
or at your workplace,

26:12.700 --> 26:14.292
how many more skeletons
do you suppose

26:14.340 --> 26:16.729
would come tumbling
out of your closet?

26:19.710 --> 26:22.838
I don't care _
about your affair.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.372
I care about your sobriety.

26:26.410 --> 26:30.346
And I depend on every member
in this group, including you,

26:30.380 --> 26:32.814
to care about mine.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.390
(gunshots)

26:49.440 --> 26:52.034
WATSON:
We are so sorry to hear

26:52.070 --> 26:54.072
about your nephew.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.704
It makes me sick.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.640
Casey was a
very good boy.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.409
He made us all
very proud.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.873
Unlike that piece of garbage
who got shot.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.387
Flynn.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.115
Did you know him?

27:06.150 --> 27:08.812
He was desked at the main
building for a few months.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.385
I didn't see him
very much, but...

27:11.430 --> 27:14.649
he obviously spent
some time here.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.157
I was the one doing
the inventory the other day.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.225
I found all the fakes he'd left.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.363
Actually, the guns are
the reason we're here.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.903
The press doesn't know,
but we're investigating

27:23.940 --> 27:27.239
the possibility Flynn was killed
by the man he sold them to.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.669
I don't understand.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.699
Why would that guy
come after...?

27:31.280 --> 27:32.679
You think Casey was
in on this, too?

27:32.710 --> 27:34.712
Look, Flynn worked here.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.444
You're the second
Victim's uncle.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.777
Sons of bitches.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.117
My nephew is dead.

27:40.150 --> 27:42.254
My sister's world
has just ended.

27:42.290 --> 27:45.157
And you come in here
and you throw accusations?

27:45.190 --> 27:47.021
Maybe I'm dirty, too.

27:47.060 --> 27:49.699
I helped Flynn rip
this place off,

27:49.730 --> 27:52.460
and then, for no good reason,
pulled Casey in.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.968
No one is accusing you
of anything, but you're

27:55.000 --> 27:57.036
the only connection we could
find between the two victims.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.129
We just wanted to know
if they knew each other.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.205
They didn't.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.003
There's no connection.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.008
We're just trying to find
the man who killed two cops.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.245
You're trying to find the man
who killed one cop.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.339
Casey.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.416
Now, if you'll
excuse me, please.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.179
I have a lot of work to do.

28:12.220 --> 28:13.949
I have a funeral
to go to tomorrow.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.055
What are you doing?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.421
I've_ had no more success
at discerning a meaningful

28:23.460 --> 28:26.759
connection between Officers
Hatem and Flynn than you.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.098
I've looked at familial
relationships, somal networks.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.131
I've even set some of
my best Irregulars

28:31.170 --> 28:33.365
to the problem, all to no avail.

28:33.410 --> 28:36.800
So now I'm practicing
my own variation of Kyudo.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.241
The martial art commonly known
as Zen archery.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.816
The objective is
to achieve mushin--

28:41.850 --> 28:43.784
_ a state
of mindless mindfulness,

28:43.820 --> 28:46.948
in which the target
and the archer become one.

28:46.990 --> 28:49.254
Now, I have
neither arrow nor bow,

28:49.290 --> 28:52.418
so I'm using my blowpipe
to establish a mental breach

28:52.460 --> 28:53.950
between myself and the puzzle.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.752
As far as I can tell,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.392
everything Hatem's
uncle said was true.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.796
Comes from a family
of cops, no enemies,

28:59.830 --> 29:01.331
no criminal background.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.907
But his killer Buros could not
have picked him at random.

29:03.940 --> 29:06.306
It's pretty hard
to imagine.

29:06.340 --> 29:07.807
Well, at least
the department can go ahead

29:07.840 --> 29:09.831
with the inspector's
funeral this time.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.972
Would've been pretty scandalous

29:11.010 --> 29:13.342
if they had to cancel two
in a week.

29:13.380 --> 29:17.316
Two is not the number
that consumes me.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.545
I still believe
the mysterious Six

29:19.590 --> 29:22.354
is the bridge
between Flynn and Buros.

29:22.390 --> 29:24.927
Unfortunately, not a single
drug dealer in the New York area

29:24.960 --> 29:26.825
seems to use the name Six.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.327
Frustrating.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.396
How is your
mindfulness right now?

29:30.430 --> 29:33.968
Can I go in there and get my
glasses without being shot?

29:38.070 --> 29:40.038
Did you go to a
meeting this morning?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.503
HOLMES:
I did.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.371
KI'I'TY:
Was our friend there?

29:43.410 --> 29:46.004
Anonymity, Kitty--
you really must look it up.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.939
Watson, if you please.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.447
Alec played football
all his life.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.243
High school, college.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.951
Your point?

29:53.990 --> 29:55.514
Players sometimes
call their teammates

29:55.560 --> 29:57.209
by their numbers.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.956
What if "Six" isn't
a street name at all?

30:03.930 --> 30:06.819
Mr. Riggs.

30:06.870 --> 30:08.269
Apologies for
keeping you waiting.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.234
We were out
readying for a funeral

30:10.270 --> 30:12.204
when we heard
that you'd been located.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.537
Well, it says here

30:13.570 --> 30:15.470
you got pulled over
with almost 500 oxy pills

30:15.510 --> 30:16.932
in your vehicle.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.538
It's not good, Charlie.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.275
Like I told the first guy, I...

30:20.310 --> 30:22.619
You were holding them for
a friend. We heard.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.311
BELL:
Here's the thing.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.443
We need information.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.549
You help us,
maybe we can help you.

30:28.590 --> 30:30.581
I'm listening.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.929
You went to high school
with Alec Flynn?

30:32.960 --> 30:35.326
Did you not play
football together?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.555
You were the punter, number six?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.864
So?
So, I don't know if you heard,

30:39.900 --> 30:42.334
but your buddy Alec
got gunned down this week.

30:42.370 --> 30:43.962
We think the shooter's

30:44.010 --> 30:45.409
a guy by the name of Buros.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.600
HOLMES: You dealt
drugs at high school.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.073
You were expelled
for that

30:48.110 --> 30:50.135
in 2002, so you graduated

30:50.180 --> 30:53.604
from selling to teenagers
to selling to adults.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.572
Alec was one of
them, eventually.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.589
Now, he needed pills
to fuel his addiction.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.144
But he was a cop,
so he couldn't go

31:00.190 --> 31:01.953
to any random dealer
on the street.

31:01.990 --> 31:05.323
So, he went to the first
one he ever knew-- you.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.884
We want to know how

31:06.930 --> 31:08.420
he got tied up
with Buros.

31:10.530 --> 31:13.966
Alec was out of control, okay?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.161
His habit was
up to 2,000 a week.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.407
And those were
friend prices.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.375
One day, he offered me
his police gun.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.435
Said it had a street value
of a thousand bucks,

31:23.480 --> 31:24.947
so I took it.

31:24.980 --> 31:27.676
I reached out to a friend
of a friend who knew Niko.

31:27.710 --> 31:31.419
He told me he'd buy all the guns
I could get my hands on.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.089
I told Alec.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.213
And he took it from there.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.421
Why did he execute Alec?

31:40.730 --> 31:44.689
A few weeks ago, Niko had asked
for a meet with him.

31:44.730 --> 31:48.689
He said the ATF had seized
one of his stashes.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.537
He wanted more guns.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.538
But Alec told him
he was through.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.936
He'd cleaned up.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.971
Armory was closed for business.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.048
Niko was ticked.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.945
And not just at Alec.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.448
I spent the next few days
trying to figure out other ways

32:05.490 --> 32:07.139
to get him the guns.

32:07.190 --> 32:10.182
Then the next time I saw him,
he said it was all good.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.551
Just like that?

32:11.590 --> 32:12.625
He said he figured out

32:12.660 --> 32:13.684
some way to make a huge score.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.027
What kind of score?

32:15.060 --> 32:17.449
I don't know.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.321
But he said something weird,
something like...

32:20.370 --> 32:23.396
uh, there was more than one way
to use a guy like Alec.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.530
That's the last time I saw him.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.418
You _need to send all
available resources

32:35.450 --> 32:37.042
to Rodman's Neck.
What?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.480
I know why Buros killed
Flynn and Hatem.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.579
Each murder was meant
to facilitate a heist.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.315
Of what?
Guns.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.521
He must have found out through
his dealings with Flynn

32:45.560 --> 32:47.482
that there were millions of
dollars worth of weapons

32:47.530 --> 32:49.350
at Rodman's Neck, and
he decided to rob it.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.061
Only one problem:

32:51.100 --> 32:53.694
the facility is at all times
heavily populated by the NYPD.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.732
He needed a way
to draw them off.

32:55.770 --> 32:57.260
An inspector's funeral.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.063
Buros did not kill
Flynn for revenge,

32:59.110 --> 33:00.566
he killed him
for his funeral.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.202
He knew that there
would be thousands

33:02.240 --> 33:03.605
of police in attendance.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.005
More specifically,
the armory would be

33:05.050 --> 33:06.779
undermanned
and vulnerable.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.017
Only, Flynn's crimes came
to light after his death.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.745
He was disgraced, and
his ceremony canceled.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.749
So Buros killed another cop with
a connection to Rodman's Neck.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.257
His funeral is
about to begin.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.110
The robbery may
already be underway.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.457
Get ESU on the line.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.025
_ Tell them someone's
raiding their damn armory.

33:52.590 --> 33:55.195
Sources say that thieves got
away with over a million dollars

33:55.230 --> 33:56.720
in military-grade weaponry,

33:56.760 --> 34:00.560
including sniper rifles,
assault rifles

34:00.600 --> 34:02.568
and even a grenade launcher.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.467
The gang of gun thieves are
reportedly led by a man named...

34:05.510 --> 34:07.432
This is the same news
report as before.

34:07.470 --> 34:09.131
You're wallowing.

34:09.180 --> 34:10.329
I'm giving myself

34:10.380 --> 34:13.838
a much-needed dose
of self-recrimination.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.247
Should have been quicker
with my deductions.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.817
And I might have prevented this.

34:19.850 --> 34:23.286
Right. Because it's
all on you.

34:25.290 --> 34:27.258
If the BrainAttic stuff's
still distracting you,

34:27.290 --> 34:29.155
it shouldn't.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.293
Tried pulling it up earlier;
there's nothing there now

34:31.330 --> 34:34.128
but two words in
big bold letters:

34:34.170 --> 34:36.161
"I'm sorry."

34:39.310 --> 34:42.302
Thought you might want some of
the pizza that Watson brought.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.372
It's strange, you know?

34:50.420 --> 34:55.380
To be found unique
in the setting of a meeting.

35:00.430 --> 35:04.264
It's the one area of my life
I feel part of the crowd.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.792
We're going over the board
again, if you're interested.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.276
I think I might have
found something.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.141
Remember those white poly fibers
at both crime scenes?

35:26.190 --> 35:28.158
They helped confirm
that Buros was there,

35:28.190 --> 35:29.487
but the lab_ never identified
their source.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.488
It could have been
anything though.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.282
A car seat, a pillow.

35:33.330 --> 35:35.355
His favorite stuffed teddy bear.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.789
Okay, this is a stockpile
the ATF seized

35:37.830 --> 35:39.798
from Buros's warehouse
a month ago.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.765
Tell me if anything
jumps out at you.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.631
Those knives are odd.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.331
They're single-edged,
there's no point at the tips.

35:46.370 --> 35:48.304
Those are
upholstery knives.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.898
Used to cut foam
for furniture cushions.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.306
I think that's where
the fibers came from.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.409
You think he's cutting up
furniture to smuggle the guns.

35:54.450 --> 35:58.341
Well, you could hide two dozen
pistols in one couch,

35:58.390 --> 36:00.415
a few bigger ones,

36:00.450 --> 36:02.816
wrap the whole thing in plastic,
and send it all south.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.452
Well done, Watson.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.379
You have found something
that the ATF did not.

36:07.430 --> 36:09.557
Question is: where is Buros now?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.818
Well, he's smart. He knows
that all the policemen

36:11.870 --> 36:13.519
in the state _
are looking for him.

36:13.570 --> 36:15.435
IfI were him,
I'd lie low.

36:15.470 --> 36:18.462
I'd stash the guns and wait
for the heat to die down.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.432
You're assuming that
he can wait at all.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.609
A newswoman
was reVIewmg

36:22.640 --> 36:25.438
the timeline of Buros's
crimes earlier.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.879
She reeled at
the alacrity

36:26.910 --> 36:28.878
with which he gunned down
two police officers.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.515
Casey Hatem was killed just
48 hours after Alec Flynn.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.348
But perhaps that's not
the timeline that matters.

36:35.390 --> 36:38.359
Perhaps what matters is
that Hatem was killed

36:38.390 --> 36:40.551
a mere 90 minutes
after the cancelation

36:40.590 --> 36:42.956
of Flynn's funeral
was announced.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.423
What's that got to do
with anything?

36:45.470 --> 36:48.268
As you pointed out, Buros was
the most wanted of wanted men.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.564
Killing two patrolmen in such
rapid succession was dangerous.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.737
Foolhardy.

36:51.770 --> 36:53.408
So, why take the risk?

36:53.440 --> 36:55.237
So, what are you saying?

36:55.280 --> 36:58.340
You think that he was working
off of some sort of deadline?

36:58.380 --> 37:00.268
We know a very large stash
of his weapons was seized

37:00.310 --> 37:01.868
less than a month ago.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.444
What if he'd already made
arrangements to transport them?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.516
Furthermore, what if
his customers were not the kind

37:05.550 --> 37:06.778
of people to be kept waiting?

37:06.820 --> 37:09.414
A drug cartel in Veracruz,
for example.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.428
He's left fibers at two
separate crime scenes.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.984
He's practically
shedding them.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.998
I submit he's been
working furiously

37:15.030 --> 37:17.999
to create hidey-holes
for the NYPD's guns.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.395
He's been carving
up cushions

37:19.430 --> 37:21.398
before he even
committed the robbery.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.738
Maybe that's because the
weapon's mode of transportation

37:23.770 --> 37:25.658
has a very strict
departure time.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.701
Well, he can't be sending them
in small planes, obviously.

37:27.740 --> 37:29.469
Not if he's
hiding them in sofas.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.375
And a truck could leave
any time it wanted.

37:31.410 --> 37:32.843
So that leaves cargo ships.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.371
Could it be that finding
Mr. Buros is as simple

37:35.420 --> 37:36.648
as identifying one

37:36.680 --> 37:39.285
which is departing for
Veracruz with a manifest

37:39.320 --> 37:41.311
_ that includes_
a shipment of furniture?

37:45.730 --> 37:47.721
(phone vibrating)

38:04.750 --> 38:06.843
Don't move!
Don't move!

38:06.880 --> 38:09.519
BELL: There's a gun!
Watch his hands! Hands!

38:13.650 --> 38:17.381
Niko Buros, you're under arrest.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.624
Hope you didn't mind
the wake-up call.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.457
Your buddy, DeMarco,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.593
the one who brought the guns
to the port this morning,

38:24.630 --> 38:26.621
he gave us your number
after we scooped him up.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.092
We pinged it to
get your location.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.461
Cuffs are too tight, man.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.331
You noticed. Good.

38:31.370 --> 38:32.701
They belonged
to Casey Hatem,

38:32.740 --> 38:34.799
the cop you murdered in
Queens the other night.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.979
Get used to them; you're
gonna be wearing them a lot.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.705
Every time you
get transported,

38:38.750 --> 38:40.945
every time you go to court,
he's gonna be with you.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.710
That supposed to scare me?

38:43.750 --> 38:46.514
It's supposed to remind you,
Niko, about what you did.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.359
Who you hurt.

38:48.390 --> 38:50.358
But don't worry, if
the cuffs don't work,

38:50.390 --> 38:52.381
we'll find other ways.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.501
*

39:42.780 --> 39:45.669
WOMAN:
It's hard...

39:49.720 --> 39:52.746
...feeling alone.

39:52.790 --> 39:56.681
Even when I'm around
my family, my friends.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.689
Some of them know
what I went through.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.699
What I'm still
going through.

40:02.730 --> 40:05.699
But they don't get it,
not really.

40:05.730 --> 40:08.460
That's why I'm so glad
for the meetings.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.934
For all of you.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.608
You may not be family,

40:12.640 --> 40:14.972
but to me you're just
as important.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.001
Thank you.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.709
I-I've got nothing I want
to share tonight. Thank you.

40:29.690 --> 40:32.682
Let's open it up
to a show of hands.

40:37.730 --> 40:39.698
My name is George.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.733
And I'm an addict.
OTHERS: Hello, George.
