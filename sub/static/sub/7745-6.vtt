00:08.843 --> 00:10.345
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.428 --> 00:11.554
See you on the outside?

00:13.181 --> 00:14.516
Wait, you're the friend from rehab?

00:15.767 --> 00:17.977
I'm gonna need your badge
and you'll have to leave immediately.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.813
- All right, go fuck yourself.
- There you go.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.981
That's what I was looking for.
Hey, you're fired.

00:22.273 --> 00:23.400
Charlie?

00:25.902 --> 00:27.821
Oh, man, I wish you were here.

00:27.904 --> 00:31.533
Me, Taylor, and Crosby are doing
Hunger Games tonight at Madison's.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.785
- And Madison's mom will be there?
- Of course.

00:34.411 --> 00:35.912
I don't think I should be here.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.997
Danny, let's just go.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.627
Look, I hope this doesn't scare you at all,
but I really like you.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.213
Yeah, it does a little.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.716
- But in a good way.
- I'll take it.

00:48.174 --> 00:50.385
- Hello?
- I need to talk to you.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.138
I heard your messages. All of them.

02:15.428 --> 02:16.513
What?

02:18.598 --> 02:22.018
You're gonna get out of that bed,
gonna take a shower,

02:22.268 --> 02:24.771
and you're gonna go about your day.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.856
Tonight, we're gonna sit down
with your father

02:26.940 --> 02:31.027
and have a conversation about
how we can learn to trust you again.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.198
Why can't we just talk about it now?

02:36.574 --> 02:39.077
We're going to wait for your father

02:39.536 --> 02:41.496
and discuss it together.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.623
As a family?

02:49.671 --> 02:51.673
<i>Boy, things got crazy last night.</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:54.968
I'm hoping I can find a way to say I'm sorry

02:55.051 --> 02:58.054
'cause I am very sorry
for running out like that.

02:58.221 --> 03:01.558
What are you apologizing for?
Your kid calls, you go.

03:01.724 --> 03:04.477
- Thank you for understanding.
- Off the phone, Officer.

03:04.936 --> 03:07.188
You're compromising my safety.

03:09.107 --> 03:11.234
I am talking to a lady here.

03:12.777 --> 03:16.531
<i>- Hey, what do you say to a do-over?
-A do-over'?</i>

03:16.823 --> 03:19.158
Yeah. A do-over. Tonight.

03:22.412 --> 03:24.289
Can I get back to you?

03:24.581 --> 03:26.749
Sure. You let me know, okay?

03:27.542 --> 03:28.585
Bye.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.467
I am going to need four stitches.

03:36.843 --> 03:39.596
I had my last tetanus shot in April

03:39.804 --> 03:44.601
and would prefer a non-generic antibiotic.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.853
Zoey, what happened?

03:48.563 --> 03:55.153
There I was, taking a warm shower
on my day off in my new apartment.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.654
And...

04:00.617 --> 04:04.662
Rusty showerhead, meet forehead.
Forehead, meet flying showerhead.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.832
I thought I was safe.

04:08.499 --> 04:11.044
But I guess we're never safe, are we?

04:11.252 --> 04:13.588
That's a cut, Zoey.
It's not an existential crisis.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.966
- Everything happens for a reason.
- Sometimes that reason is bad plumbing.

04:17.050 --> 04:21.930
No, I think the reason is so I could
come in here and ask you about your date.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.100
- So, how was it?
- It was nice. Let's go.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.978
You don't want to talk about it?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.189
Fine. That means it was awesome.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.484
Hey.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.574
Holy shit, you slept with him.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.910
- I did not.
- You did.

04:43.993 --> 04:47.080
You forget I know what you look like
after you've had sex.

04:47.163 --> 04:49.374
Jesus, Eddie.
I didn't come here to talk about this.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.210
- So you did sleep with him?
- I didn't even kiss him.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.089
- That bad?
- Jesus, Eddie, I feel awful.

04:56.631 --> 05:00.176
- Why? Because you didn't kiss him?
- No, because of Grace.

05:00.843 --> 05:05.139
She got herself into trouble last night
and I was totally checked out.

05:06.808 --> 05:09.268
- What'd she do?
- She lied.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.021
Apple doesn't fall far.

05:13.439 --> 05:17.360
She lied and she ran off with this guy
who wasn't good for her,

05:17.527 --> 05:20.530
and she was wandering around the city
and, you know, where was I?

05:21.864 --> 05:23.074
Everybody alive?

05:23.533 --> 05:25.743
- Yeah.
- So calm the fuck down.

05:25.994 --> 05:27.996
I say that with love.

05:29.706 --> 05:31.457
All right. Thanks.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.506
Atropine. Shit.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.720
What you got there?

05:43.886 --> 05:45.138
Nothing.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.515
Are you gonna make me tickle you?

05:48.224 --> 05:51.227
I'm just practicing. No biggie.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.314
- Flashcards?
- Yes.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.774
Me likey.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.278
<i>Dr. Roman to bay five. Dr. Roman, bay five.</i>

06:03.573 --> 06:05.575
Aren't you gonna get that?

06:05.700 --> 06:07.035
No can do.

06:07.243 --> 06:11.956
Part of being a first-year resident
means you actually have to touch a patient.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.793
I need to know
that you're there for me, Coop.

06:16.169 --> 06:19.589
I've been hurt, okay?
And I've given this body to you.

06:19.964 --> 06:23.551
And there's no lack of appreciation
on my part, trust me.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.304
- I'm just saying...
- You need to give a little, too.

06:26.387 --> 06:30.016
Or else I might need to pull back.
Do I have to pull back?

06:30.975 --> 06:33.853
Just let me know now before I'm in too deep.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.271
Okay, okay.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.066
But you have to promise
to take the next one.

06:38.149 --> 06:39.484
I promise.

06:40.735 --> 06:44.447
- I really feel like we're going somewhere.
- You certainly are.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.365
Bay five.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.873
- You're not Dr. Roman.
- What a keen sense of perception you have.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.086
- Rough landing?
- You cannot keep doing her work.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.130
That hurt?

07:01.881 --> 07:03.049
Like a bitch.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.718
Let's get this homie up to radiology.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.429
Coop.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.891
Chillax, Jacks.
She's taking the next one, cross my heart.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.018
Well, I'm holding you to it.

07:14.102 --> 07:15.186
Cruz?

07:20.108 --> 07:22.652
- I trust you got my card.
- I did not.

07:25.029 --> 07:29.367
Well, my deepest sympathies.
I'll let Human Resources know you're here.

07:30.368 --> 07:32.245
You're a little early.

07:32.829 --> 07:35.206
It'll give me a chance
to catch up with some old friends.

07:40.086 --> 07:42.338
I'll see if they can squeeze you in earlier.

07:42.797 --> 07:44.215
Hey, man!

07:44.549 --> 07:46.092
I mean, hey, man.

07:46.259 --> 07:47.760
It's all good.

07:49.554 --> 07:50.680
Welcome back, Dr. Cruz.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.098
Mike.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.975
To what do we owe the pleasure, Mike?

07:54.142 --> 07:58.688
I had to come in for my exit interview.
Been putting it off. Personal reasons.

07:58.771 --> 08:01.357
So here I am, not putting things off.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.860
Fucking Yankees!

08:04.152 --> 08:06.445
- Get off of me, man!
- Well, duty calls.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.699
Tell Dr. Roman she has a patient, please?

08:09.991 --> 08:12.368
- If you'll excuse me.
- Know my way around.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.122
35-year-old male.
Severely intoxicated and violent.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.875
Broken nose, mild forehead lacerations.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.461
- Goddamn bus!
- He was hit by a bus?

08:22.545 --> 08:25.089
Actually, he hit the bus with his face.

08:25.173 --> 08:27.550
Yup, apparently
he didn't like the Yankees logo.

08:27.842 --> 08:30.386
- Mets fans.
- Get off of me, man.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.972
- Looking good, Thor.
- Holy shit!

08:33.306 --> 08:37.018
- Thor, restraints, please!
- What the hell is he doing here?

08:39.353 --> 08:41.814
This is nucking futs.

08:42.148 --> 08:43.733
Who is that guy?

08:44.275 --> 08:47.320
Sorry, but some things
you should just not talk about.

08:47.403 --> 08:51.949
But if I had missed this, I'd be so angry,
and that is all you need to know.

08:53.284 --> 08:54.410
Okay.

08:56.287 --> 08:59.957
- This hurt?
- Please. This ain't pain.

09:02.919 --> 09:05.338
You know,
you ever think about taking it up a notch?

09:05.421 --> 09:07.715
Army could use another good nurse.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.008
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.092
No.

09:12.929 --> 09:15.348
- What, you think?
- I'm just saying.

09:15.431 --> 09:19.477
The way you handled that gunshot
and the baby, you kept your cool.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.354
I keep my cool.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.105
I do.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.320
Dr. Roman. You have a patient.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.739
Get your hands off me!

09:33.324 --> 09:35.409
- Really?
- Yes, really.

09:38.788 --> 09:42.375
Girardi is your mother's bitch!

09:42.458 --> 09:44.377
Take it easy. You're gonna aspirate.

09:45.378 --> 09:46.879
He's all yours.

09:46.963 --> 09:49.090
- Thor, I need a minute.
- Take seven.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.467
Let me go! You don't know me.

09:54.804 --> 09:56.055
Get off!

10:09.986 --> 10:14.115
Nobody smokes in New York anymore.
Took me 10 minutes to find a lighter.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.117
A smoking doctor.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.160
I haven't been doing much doctoring lately.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.246
Hey, how's your kid?

10:20.329 --> 10:22.665
Well, she pretty much
just scared the crap out of me.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.584
It's gonna be okay. It's typical teenage stuff.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.045
Yeah, well, keep an eye on that.

10:31.299 --> 10:35.428
I got to say, last night, you being here,

10:36.345 --> 10:38.097
it's kind of freaking me out a little bit.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.850
I had to clean things up around here
at some point.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.019
I wanted to see you.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.356
Until 12 hours ago,
I was not thinking about you.

10:48.399 --> 10:51.861
Look, I'm not a big believer
in fate and all those things,

10:52.194 --> 10:54.488
but we're not a one-time thing.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.038
Don't you have an appointment?

11:20.723 --> 11:22.975
- You a nurse?
- Yeah, what's up?

11:23.517 --> 11:24.977
I don't feel so good.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.645
Join the club.

11:27.063 --> 11:28.689
- Headaches?
- Yes.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.149
Stomachaches?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.986
Your heart rate is a little elevated.
You nervous, honey?

11:36.364 --> 11:37.656
How long you been feeling like this?

11:39.158 --> 11:41.035
Just tell Dr. Prentiss what's bothering you.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.288
It hurts all over.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.166
Where's your mom, Anthony?

11:47.249 --> 11:49.210
- Where do you live, kid?
- Bronx.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.754
Really? You know, I grew up there.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.048
- Where exactly?
- Valentine.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.133
- Valentine and?
-197th.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.098
Open up for me.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.602
That's what I thought. We're done here.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.145
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, we're done, okay?

12:08.229 --> 12:09.355
You're asymptomatic.

12:09.438 --> 12:10.856
- You're here to score drugs.
- No, I'm not.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.942
Valentine has more drug dealers
per square inch

12:13.025 --> 12:15.194
-than all five boroughs combined.
- I'm not a druggie.

12:15.277 --> 12:19.907
Look, hey, good luck with your life, kid.
Bad idea to be born there. Really.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.953
You want to go to detox?
I can help you if you're honest with me.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.039
White ladies never have to worry
about being believed.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.584
Okay.

12:36.215 --> 12:39.343
Dr. Prentiss wants to run these
on the kid in five.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.887
I thought Dr. Prentiss
wanted him discharged.

12:42.263 --> 12:43.973
How's your head?
You ready to get out of here?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.183
I'm okay.

12:47.226 --> 12:51.981
But don't you think he looked a little thin?
A little sad?

12:53.274 --> 12:55.401
- Who?
- Dr. Cruz.

12:57.153 --> 12:59.738
He just lost a kid, Zoey.
It's nothing to gossip about.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.490
I'm not gossiping.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.660
It's not gossip
if it's laced with a genuine concern.

13:05.161 --> 13:08.873
Respect and distance,
that's what Dr. Cruz deserves from us.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.380
So...

13:17.590 --> 13:21.177
The easiest fix here
is to reset your nose by hand.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.012
It's easy peas)'-

13:23.179 --> 13:25.139
It's not gonna end up looking messed up,
is it?

13:25.222 --> 13:27.975
Marta, will you prep a compress, please?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.402
Watch it, you stupid cunt!

13:46.744 --> 13:51.665
Four years at Northwestern.
Then six years private medical school.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.459
Sorry.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.254
See, now I stand before you,
three whole months into my residency

13:57.338 --> 14:00.007
with the future of your face in my hands.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.219
So...

14:05.012 --> 14:06.889
That's Dr. Cunt to you.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.895
Pack him in ice, Marta.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.239
Respect and distance.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.835
Sugar-free. Good choice.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.713
Hello, Zoey.

14:40.839 --> 14:44.260
I'm surprised you recognized me
in my civilian attire.

14:44.385 --> 14:46.470
I'd recognize you anywhere.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.225
Are you okay? How are you doing?

14:53.686 --> 14:56.981
You know,
I never really got the chance to tell you,

14:57.773 --> 15:00.442
but I really enjoyed working with you.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.028
And I enjoyed...

15:07.449 --> 15:09.743
Have you met our new doctors?
They're really good.

15:09.827 --> 15:13.622
It's not that you weren't good.
You were really, really good.

15:16.292 --> 15:18.127
What... What happened?

15:18.419 --> 15:19.795
Showerhead.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.975
Patient suffered closed comminuted fracture
to left radius.

15:34.602 --> 15:37.229
Hey. How'd it go with broken-nose guy?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.400
Look, I'm sorry, but it was your turn.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.990
What...

15:50.409 --> 15:52.161
Okay. This is weird.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.054
No.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.473
Okay. Okay.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.141
You're a slut.

16:35.329 --> 16:38.374
You're a bitch! You're such a bitch!

16:45.297 --> 16:48.175
No,no,no,no.
I have two moms. I can't say that.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.010
Okay.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.595
You're a...

16:52.471 --> 16:53.972
You're a cu...

16:54.098 --> 16:56.308
You're a cu... You're a cunt.

16:56.892 --> 16:57.976
Cunt.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.521
You're a cunt.

17:01.105 --> 17:02.648
I'm going straight to hell.

17:35.264 --> 17:38.475
<i>This is Charlie Cruz.
Leave a message if you care.</i>

17:40.436 --> 17:43.647
Mike, I don't have your number. So...

17:45.774 --> 17:47.818
You may have left already.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.904
Would you give me a call?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.366
I'd like to talk to you. It's Jackie.

17:58.704 --> 18:03.125
- No, just stop touching it.
- I need you to calm down for me, sir.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.711
It only hurts when you fucking touch it!

18:05.794 --> 18:08.547
Would you watch your language, please?
There are children present.

18:08.630 --> 18:09.798
Peyton.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.885
Why did you order a test on a patient
that I already discharged?

18:12.968 --> 18:15.804
- What do the results say?
- They say he's not sick, that's what they say.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.973
Are there any drugs in his system?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.768
- Don't push it.
- I'll take that as a no.

18:26.940 --> 18:27.983
Fuck!

18:28.192 --> 18:30.110
Kid, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
All right?

18:30.194 --> 18:32.321
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.655
Step off the floor.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.618
You're okay. Just breathe, okay?
Just breathe.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.995
Breathe. There you go. Breathe.

18:41.038 --> 18:44.208
It's gonna be okay. Okay? Deep breaths.
Deep, in.

18:45.167 --> 18:49.004
Out. There you go. There you go, buddy.
I got you. Breathe in.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.048
And out. Okay.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.519
PTSD.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.523
- Post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Who, Anthony?

19:07.689 --> 19:10.192
Seen it a zillion times in soldiers,
but never a kid.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.401
Well, what happened to him?

19:11.485 --> 19:14.655
Well, his little sister
got caught in gang crossfire.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.240
He was holding her hand at the time.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.783
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know.

19:17.866 --> 19:21.078
I would have missed it
if you hadn't gone postal on that asshole.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.955
I'd hate to put him on meds. He's so young.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.540
Yeah, I know.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.375
What would the Army do?

19:26.708 --> 19:30.254
Try. I mean, they've tried drugs,
they've tried shrinks.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.215
Now they're saying going back
to the scene of the trauma can be helpful.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.537
I punched a patient.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.377
How's your hand?

20:15.841 --> 20:19.094
I tried calling you on Charlie's number.

20:19.177 --> 20:23.223
It was weird leaving a message for you
with him.

20:24.933 --> 20:29.229
If you want to call me, I will give you
my number and you can call me.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.317
But I need to turn off his phone.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.445
It's time.

20:39.865 --> 20:43.785
Right. You may have a little bruising,
but nothing broken here.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.665
- Can I have my hand back?
- Does he forgive me?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.085
Do you forgive him?

20:54.463 --> 20:58.717
You're very confusing, the way
you complicate things that are simple.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.469
It's a gift.

21:02.471 --> 21:06.600
Does it make me an awful person
to say that part of me is relieved?

21:07.768 --> 21:08.810
No.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.067
The most painful part

21:16.234 --> 21:19.696
is when you realize
the first thing you feel is relief.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.701
That fucking flash of relief

21:25.410 --> 21:27.829
that confirms that you are awful.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.167
Awful for being relieved

21:32.834 --> 21:36.213
and angry that that's the first thing you feel.

21:37.506 --> 21:41.343
And then even angrier
that there's no one left to be angry at.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.679
There is no getting it right.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.683
I know he was an addict.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.355
I just want somebody to tell me
that I did my best.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.360
You did better than most.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.416
So...

22:14.668 --> 22:16.420
Who was your date last night?

22:18.380 --> 22:19.965
He's a nice man,

22:21.091 --> 22:22.467
who I like.

22:23.385 --> 22:27.097
Well, why not stay with the nice man?
Why come out with me?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.936
You know me better than I want you to.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.814
That makes two of us.

22:40.402 --> 22:44.448
I know what I did was wrong.
I broke up with him and everything, okay?

22:44.531 --> 22:47.451
It's not gonna happen again.
So can we go now?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.996
You could have gotten into
a lot worse trouble than you did, sweetie.

22:51.079 --> 22:54.207
The city can be
a very dangerous place for kids.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.169
No TV, no phone, no computer for a month.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.255
- Jeez, excessive much?
- You want to go for two months?

23:00.338 --> 23:01.715
I said I was sorry.

23:01.882 --> 23:04.551
It's more than being sorry, honey.
You're growing up.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.804
And there are hundreds of decisions
you're going to have to face every day.

23:07.888 --> 23:10.474
And we won't always be there for you.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.685
<i>Take a breath. Hold it in.</i>

23:14.352 --> 23:15.812
Take it easy.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.107
You got this.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.857
That was goodbye, wasn't it?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.655
You didn't have to come all the way
over here just to say goodbye.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.616
Yes, I did.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.756
So Tommy comes home, right,

24:24.840 --> 24:27.676
and he says real innocent-like,
"No, Dad, that belongs to Joey."

24:28.009 --> 24:30.846
So I go to Joey.
Joey looks at me and says, "No, no, no, Dad.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.598
"That's Tommy's pot.
I don't even like kush."

24:34.850 --> 24:38.478
- What'd you do?
- What'd I do? I grounded them for a month.

24:39.271 --> 24:41.439
- Then I smoked their weed.
- No.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.608
On my day off,
when they were at their mother's.

24:43.692 --> 24:47.362
It was purely medicinal, Jackie.
These kids are killing me.

24:47.612 --> 24:51.283
- I think girls are harder than boys.
- How do you figure that?

24:51.366 --> 24:54.035
'Cause with girls,
you got to worry about the boys, too.

24:56.121 --> 24:57.789
This is very true.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.876
You see, boys can be very conniving.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.505
See that sign down there?

25:07.966 --> 25:13.597
If I can hit that sign with that rock,
you have to kiss me.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.601
Deal.

25:26.776 --> 25:27.819
Fuck.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.405
Try again.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.326
All right, but I'm gonna move a little closer.
That's not cheating, is it?

25:34.409 --> 25:36.369
- No, no, that's okay.
- Okay.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.581
Don't you move.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.765
I'm usually very good at this.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.601
You're breaking the law over there.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.937
You're right. You should call a cop.

26:04.064 --> 26:06.024
Come on, baby. One time.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.653
Bull's-eye!

26:32.759 --> 26:34.094
You didn't close your eyes.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.808
- Sorry.
- This is totally unacceptable.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.227
Can we try again?

26:58.201 --> 26:59.369
Again?
