00:00.171 --> 00:02.349
Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"...

00:02.373 --> 00:03.580
The police dug up
your father today.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.987
They think that somebody
was poisoning him.

00:06.011 --> 00:07.314
Apparently, I'm a suspect.

00:07.338 --> 00:09.356
Bree felt threatened
by the past.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.358
Get the damn lawyer.
Are you hitting on me?

00:11.382 --> 00:14.161
Gabrielle was threatened
by seduction.

00:14.185 --> 00:15.992
Do you mean Julie?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.624
If I come back with you,
then I can make it up to her.

00:17.648 --> 00:19.696
You should find your father
first. Let me help.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.169
And while some threats...

00:22.193 --> 00:24.000
Aah!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.173
Aah!

00:26.197 --> 00:27.604
Were kept under control...

00:27.628 --> 00:29.376
Let's get this over with.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.400
Some were left free to return.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.285
Since her first day on the job,

00:38.309 --> 00:41.718
it had been clear
to Lynette Scavo

00:41.742 --> 00:46.153
that her new boss Nina
was unusually tense.

00:46.177 --> 00:48.425
To help relieve her tension,

00:48.449 --> 00:51.428
Lynette tried giving
her boss thoughtful gifts...

00:51.452 --> 00:54.232
A soothing wave machine...

00:55.426 --> 00:59.126
Aromatherapy candles...

01:00.461 --> 01:05.372
Even meditative chi balls.

01:05.396 --> 01:08.615
But nothing seemed to ease
Nina's tension.

01:08.639 --> 01:12.149
"Distilled
the old-fashioned way."

01:12.173 --> 01:14.621
You know,
it actually hurts my teeth

01:14.645 --> 01:16.583
to say that out loud.

01:16.607 --> 01:20.227
You folks are going to toddle
back to your little holes

01:20.251 --> 01:23.160
and you are gonna come up
with a decent slogan

01:23.184 --> 01:26.694
or I will can all your asses
the old-fashioned way.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.469
Until one day
when it occurred to Lynette

01:32.493 --> 01:35.172
there was one form of relaxation

01:35.196 --> 01:38.645
she had yet to try.

01:38.669 --> 01:41.578
It's a gimlet. You'll love it.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.810
What exactly is your plan here,

01:43.834 --> 01:46.821
to get me all liquored up
so I buy the revised pitch?

01:46.845 --> 01:48.855
Don't be ridiculous.

01:48.879 --> 01:52.159
Could we get a trough of these,
please?

01:52.183 --> 01:55.167
I can't remember the last time
I was in a bar.

01:55.191 --> 01:57.594
Must have been the last time
I had a boyfriend,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.095
which was...

01:59.119 --> 02:01.398
Oh, god, I'm a nun.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.601
So why don't you go out
and get in the game?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.102
Believe it or not,

02:06.126 --> 02:10.776
when it comes to meeting men,
I am... shy.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.779
Well, I'm not.

02:12.803 --> 02:15.111
So, uh...

02:15.135 --> 02:17.844
What about that guy over there?

02:17.868 --> 02:20.217
He's been checking you out
since we walked in.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.349
He's cute.

02:22.373 --> 02:23.850
So go over there.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.792
No.

02:25.816 --> 02:28.225
Oh, for god's sakes.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.549
Where are you going?
Lynette, sit...

02:34.285 --> 02:35.862
Hey, stretch,

02:35.886 --> 02:38.235
see my friend over there?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.259
She thinks you're cute.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.743
Why don't you buy her a drink?

02:48.199 --> 02:51.378
Hey, everybody. Hi.

02:51.402 --> 02:53.680
Oh, it's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?

02:53.704 --> 02:55.182
Thank you, sweetie.

02:55.206 --> 02:58.355
Oh, hey, Lynette, I read
the new vodka proposal.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.258
Oh, you guys hit it
out of the park.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.259
Wow.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.760
I love that color.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.792
Thanks. Hey, Nina.

03:05.816 --> 03:07.334
Yeah?

03:07.358 --> 03:10.297
And although it had come about
in an unexpected manner...

03:10.321 --> 03:11.798
Aren't those the same clothes

03:11.822 --> 03:13.800
you were wearing last night
in the bar?

03:13.824 --> 03:15.342
Yep.

03:15.366 --> 03:18.366
Nina's tension had finally
been released...

03:19.770 --> 03:22.749
The old-fashioned way.

03:22.773 --> 03:30.773
♪♪♪

04:05.876 --> 04:07.354
Everyone in this world

04:07.378 --> 04:09.356
needs someone
they can depend upon,

04:09.380 --> 04:12.699
be it a faithful companion,

04:12.723 --> 04:16.503
trusted confidant...

04:16.527 --> 04:20.307
Or loyal friend.

04:20.331 --> 04:23.239
For Susan Mayer,
that dependable someone

04:23.263 --> 04:27.874
was her book agent lonny moon.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.376
It was lonny

04:29.400 --> 04:32.349
who helped Susan promote
her first children's book.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.357
It was lonny who rushed Susan
to the hospital

04:35.381 --> 04:37.784
the night Julie was born.
No, no, no, no, no!

04:37.808 --> 04:40.357
It was lonny
who took Susan's mind

04:40.381 --> 04:42.289
off her painful divorce

04:42.313 --> 04:44.491
with a fun vacation.

04:44.515 --> 04:49.396
Yes, lonny was Susan's rock.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.468
Sadly for Susan,

04:51.492 --> 04:54.371
her rock was about to crumble.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.373
For those of you
just joining us,

04:56.397 --> 04:59.646
we have a new development
in the Melanie foster case...

04:59.670 --> 05:02.579
Lonny,
what are you doing here? It's past noon.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.960
Which means it's now
socially acceptable

05:04.984 --> 05:06.483
to begin drinking.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.585
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.417
I am so behind in my work.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.419
But I'm glad I came.
This is fun.

05:12.443 --> 05:14.461
I've gotta be honest.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.763
I had an ulterior motive.

05:16.787 --> 05:17.924
Oh?

05:17.948 --> 05:20.827
I've decided to start
my own agency.

05:20.851 --> 05:22.329
You're leaving muir and hunt?

05:22.353 --> 05:24.300
You helped build that place.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.073
I know, but I just feel
it's time.

05:27.097 --> 05:30.937
And now the question is,
will you come with me?

05:30.961 --> 05:33.340
Well... of course.

05:33.364 --> 05:35.342
Okay!

05:35.366 --> 05:38.084
To the future.

05:38.108 --> 05:39.586
I'll just call the agency,

05:39.610 --> 05:41.688
and I'll let them know
I'm going with you.

05:41.712 --> 05:44.751
Oh, I don't think
that's necessary.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.453
Really?

05:46.477 --> 05:50.527
Yeah, I think
it might be rude not to.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.499
Lonny...

05:52.523 --> 05:54.531
What's going on?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.833
Okay.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.106
There's been some bad blood
between me and the partners.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.938
Why?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.940
I got into this thing
where I had to move

06:03.964 --> 06:05.951
a little client money
around temporarily

06:05.975 --> 06:07.714
to cover some expenses.

06:07.738 --> 06:10.847
You had to "move money"?
What does that mean?

06:10.871 --> 06:14.350
I took a little from here,
and I moved it there.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.683
It was no big deal.

06:16.707 --> 06:18.385
Really?

06:18.409 --> 06:20.387
'Cause it sort of sounds
like embezzlement.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.889
Why do people
keep using that word?!

06:22.913 --> 06:25.392
Who else is using that word?

06:25.416 --> 06:26.363
Nobody.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.536
The partners
and their forensic accountant.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.538
Oh, my god.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.401
Lonny, did you "move"
some ofmymoney?

06:34.425 --> 06:37.103
Absolutely not. I swear!

06:37.127 --> 06:39.776
Susan, don't look at me
that way.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.748
I know what I did was wrong,

06:41.772 --> 06:44.456
and I feel like
a complete idiot for doing it,

06:44.480 --> 06:46.653
but please,
please don't hate me.

06:46.677 --> 06:48.915
Well, I don't hate you.

06:48.939 --> 06:51.709
I couldn't hate you.
You're my lonny.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.692
So...

06:55.716 --> 06:58.786
Will you still come with me?

07:02.593 --> 07:04.731
You know what?

07:04.755 --> 07:06.733
This is one of those times

07:06.757 --> 07:09.436
when you find out
who your real friends are,

07:09.460 --> 07:11.508
so, yeah.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.440
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

07:13.464 --> 07:18.645
You are one special lady,
Susan Mayer.

07:18.669 --> 07:21.918
Is that the baby's head?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.712
No, that's his foot.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.694
That looks like a head to me.

07:27.718 --> 07:29.896
Well, that settles it.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.528
When this baby's born,

07:31.552 --> 07:33.560
I'll be in charge
of putting on the socks.

07:33.584 --> 07:37.033
You're glowing today,
you know that?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.065
Pregnancy agrees with you. Yeah?

07:39.089 --> 07:42.008
Well, if you don't mind
the hemorrhoids and the nausea,

07:42.032 --> 07:43.610
it's quite the party.

07:43.634 --> 07:46.581
I wonder where David is.
He should've been here by now.

07:46.605 --> 07:48.715
So this new lawyer's good?

07:48.739 --> 07:50.717
He's quite the shark.
You're gonna love him.

07:50.741 --> 07:52.619
He hasn't lost a case
in six years.

07:52.643 --> 07:55.126
He argued in front of
the state supreme court,

07:55.150 --> 07:58.555
and he made our conjugal visit
happen pretty damn fast.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.657
Well, hey, I'm a fan already.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.959
Sorry I'm late.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.561
Oh, David.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.955
Good to see you, Gaby.
Carlos, I'm David.

08:22.573 --> 08:25.051
I don't think so.

08:25.075 --> 08:27.654
What the hell are you doing?

08:27.678 --> 08:30.156
That guy's not gonna be
my lawyer.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.980
Find a new one.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.563
You haven't filed
a single charge.

08:36.587 --> 08:39.596
Either determine a homicide
or release the body.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.528
We've got a court order
which says,

08:41.552 --> 08:43.600
until we're done with it,
the corpse is ours.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.501
He is not a corpse.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.203
He is a man
named Rex Van De Kamp.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.235
He was a loving husband,
a devoted father

08:49.259 --> 08:50.837
and a successful doctor.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.840
So successful, in fact,
that he left me enough money

08:53.864 --> 08:56.643
to sue the city, this precinct

08:56.667 --> 08:58.084
and you two gentlemen personally

08:58.108 --> 09:00.186
just for the fun of it.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.719
Mrs. Van De Kamp, we don't
respond well to threats,

09:02.743 --> 09:05.592
so if I... release the body.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.654
What?

09:07.678 --> 09:09.596
The evidence we have
is minimal at best.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.097
Mrs. Van De Kamp
was gracious enough

09:11.121 --> 09:12.759
to come down here
and take that lie detector test.

09:12.783 --> 09:14.740
I think it's the least
we can do for her.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.625
Thank you.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.706
So, uh, what will happen now?

09:19.730 --> 09:22.538
Obviously, we'll put
Mr. Van De Kamp back

09:22.562 --> 09:23.640
just like we found him.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.647
Yes, and I'm sure
you will Bury him

09:25.671 --> 09:27.644
with all the dignity
of a dead hamster.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.676
No, I want Rex released to me

09:29.700 --> 09:32.649
and I will make
all the arrangements.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.180
Fine.

09:34.204 --> 09:37.161
And, of course, you'll be
paying all the costs.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.325
Of course.

09:39.349 --> 09:41.958
Detective barton,

09:41.982 --> 09:44.762
you are clearly a gentleman.

09:51.321 --> 09:54.300
People have gathered
at Attenborough high school,

09:54.324 --> 09:55.807
where Melanie attended...

09:55.831 --> 09:58.304
No, it's fine. I'll pick 'em up
on my way home.

09:58.328 --> 10:00.306
Okay, so what do you want?

10:00.330 --> 10:03.309
Oh, Parker hates pepperoni.
Um, how about sausage?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.051
Yeah, and a small cheese.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.714
Okay, perfect. Love you.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.215
Hey, you.

10:09.239 --> 10:10.757
Hey.

10:10.781 --> 10:12.759
You wanna hit O'Donnell's?
I owe you a beer.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.762
Actually, I owe you
so much more than that.

10:15.786 --> 10:18.865
You're welcome,
but I really need to get home.

10:18.889 --> 10:20.897
Oh, come on. I had such
a good time last night.

10:20.921 --> 10:24.370
Um, why don't you ask Trudy?
She loves going out.

10:24.394 --> 10:27.378
Trudy? Are you kidding?
I don't need the competition.

10:27.402 --> 10:30.306
Have you seen Trudy
without her jacket? She's hot.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.038
Oh, is she now?

10:32.062 --> 10:34.610
Oh, I-I didn't mean
that you're not... hot.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.713
I just... you're married.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.714
Ah.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.716
You know, you're off the market.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.689
I don't have to worry
about fighting you for guys.

10:42.713 --> 10:44.996
Come on, Lynette.
Just one quick little drink.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.993
I was actually starting to think

10:47.017 --> 10:49.355
that you and I
were becoming pals.

10:49.379 --> 10:52.729
Pals? 'Cause sometimes
it's hard to tell.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.766
You know, I wasn't feeling
the love today

10:54.790 --> 10:57.764
when you mocked my campaign
in front of the clients.

10:57.788 --> 11:01.668
That was just
putting on a show for work.

11:01.692 --> 11:06.242
In the future, always assume
that I am winking inside.

11:07.698 --> 11:10.416
Come on.
I hate to go to a bar alone.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.648
I feel like such a loser.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.651
Okay. One drink.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.253
Yeah! One or two.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.107
No.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.011
Thank you so much
for bringing my mail over.

11:45.035 --> 11:48.054
You know, I have some
of yours in the kitchen.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.717
Well, that's the fourth time.
What's up with this postman?

11:50.741 --> 11:53.820
Oh, I know. He used to be great.

11:53.844 --> 11:56.422
Then he had this stroke,
and, well,

11:56.446 --> 11:59.766
now we're lucky if he
doesn't drool on the coupons.

11:59.790 --> 12:02.850
But feel free to snoop around.
I'll be right back.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.886
Now for those of you
just joining us,

12:19.910 --> 12:22.889
families in Chicago breathed
a sigh of relief today

12:22.913 --> 12:25.897
as an arrest was finally made
in the brutal attack

12:25.921 --> 12:28.895
on local high school student
Melanie foster.

12:28.919 --> 12:31.497
But word
of the suspect's capture

12:31.521 --> 12:34.030
comes as small comfort
to the foster family... Betty?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.867
Who lost their
17-year-old daughter

12:35.891 --> 12:37.363
almost four months ago. Betty?

12:37.387 --> 12:39.035
The victim's body was
discovered in a local park

12:39.059 --> 12:40.929
less than a mile
from Attenborough high.

12:48.498 --> 12:51.247
Did you see the news?
They've arrested somebody.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.771
Yeah. Looks like
we're in the clear.

13:05.055 --> 13:07.794
Well, I have some good news.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.796
The police have finally released
Rex's body.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.397
About time.
You must be so relieved.

13:11.421 --> 13:12.999
You know,
mostly I'm just annoyed

13:13.023 --> 13:15.246
that the whole thing
happened in the first place.

13:15.270 --> 13:18.244
I mean, how in the world could
anybody accuse me of murder?

13:18.268 --> 13:20.828
Well, youarewound pretty tight.

13:22.933 --> 13:26.252
What? The supermom is always
the first to snap.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.254
They've done studies.

13:28.278 --> 13:29.956
Anyway, I was hoping

13:29.980 --> 13:32.288
that you were all free
Friday morning,

13:32.312 --> 13:35.899
because that's when I'm going
to be hosting the reburial.

13:35.923 --> 13:37.263
The what?

13:37.287 --> 13:39.265
Look, I know it's an imposition,

13:39.289 --> 13:41.297
but Danielle is away
on a class trip,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.969
and Andrew is back
at camp hennessey

13:42.993 --> 13:44.940
for a little refresher course.

13:44.964 --> 13:46.933
Well, it's just gonna be

13:46.957 --> 13:48.935
a very brief
and dignified ceremony,

13:48.959 --> 13:51.878
and I was hoping that
you could say a few words,

13:51.902 --> 13:53.902
and, um, I'm gonna read a poem.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.266
We would love to come.
Absolutely.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.390
I'm busy. Sorry.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.352
Edie!

14:06.376 --> 14:08.824
She's going to read a poem.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.156
Ow!

14:10.180 --> 14:13.250
Fine. Yes, yes,
we'd all love to come.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.402
Well, thank you.

14:16.426 --> 14:20.967
You don't know how much
this means to me.

14:20.991 --> 14:23.970
I realize looking back
that I was still in shock

14:23.994 --> 14:26.542
during Rex's first funeral.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.146
I don't think it had quite
hit me yet what had happened,

14:30.170 --> 14:33.149
so that's why this small
ceremony means so much to me,

14:33.173 --> 14:35.183
because I realize now that...

14:37.547 --> 14:40.547
This is the last chance
I'm gonna have to say good-bye.

14:42.052 --> 14:43.052
Oh.

14:45.555 --> 14:48.885
Unless, of course,
they dig him up again.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.971
Sure, there was times when

14:54.995 --> 14:57.073
Lisa was rude and obnoxious,

14:57.097 --> 14:59.906
but I know now that
that was no excuse

14:59.930 --> 15:02.130
to always be beatin' on her.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.943
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

15:09.079 --> 15:12.188
Good job, you two.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.466
This is an example of how to use
incarceration to your benefit.

15:15.490 --> 15:18.464
It's a chance for people
to take a step back

15:18.488 --> 15:22.068
and observe the obstacles
they face in their marriage.

15:22.092 --> 15:25.071
Can I go now?
'Cause I have a lot to say

15:25.095 --> 15:27.373
about the obstacles I'm facing
in my marriage.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.375
We don't got any obstacles.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.307
Yes, we do, Lamar.
We got big ones.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.009
Okay, hold on, you two.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.520
I think that it's
Carlos and Gabrielle's turn.

15:35.544 --> 15:37.535
Thanks, but we're good.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.148
This is
your third group session,

15:42.172 --> 15:44.150
but you have yet
to share anything.

15:44.174 --> 15:48.924
Come on. Talk to us.
How's your marriage?

15:48.948 --> 15:52.458
Shaky at best. And why is that?

15:52.482 --> 15:55.001
I don't know.
I hired a brilliant lawyer

15:55.025 --> 15:56.462
to get my husband
out of this hellhole,

15:56.486 --> 15:58.534
and he fired him
for no reason at all.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.967
Carlos?

16:00.991 --> 16:02.938
I just didn't like him.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.940
Why not? He's experienced,
he's intelligent,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.547
he's successful. Exactly.

16:06.571 --> 16:08.944
I'd prefer an attorney you
didn't find so damn appealing.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.248
Oh, my god. You fired him
because you're jealous?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.620
Don't I have the rightto? You know,
she cheated on me.

16:14.644 --> 16:18.958
Oh, Bob, you beat your wife. You are so not
allowed to gasp. Don't you talk that way to him.

16:18.982 --> 16:22.128
One more word out of you, Lisa,
and I will backhand you myself.

16:22.152 --> 16:24.960
Okay, calm down. Thousands of fat,
bald attorneys out there in the world,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.001
and she's gotta get the one that
looks like an underwear model.

16:27.025 --> 16:28.964
I'm not discussing this anymore.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.618
You can rot in here
for all I care.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.241
So, um...

16:35.265 --> 16:37.243
Mona, what do you feel

16:37.267 --> 16:39.245
are the biggest problems
in your marriage?

16:39.269 --> 16:41.147
By the way,
he was wearing a suit.

16:41.171 --> 16:43.009
How do you know
he had a good body?

16:43.033 --> 16:44.650
Doyouknow? No!

16:44.674 --> 16:46.414
I bet he's hot.

16:49.439 --> 16:52.658
Do I need to say what
our biggest problem is,

16:52.682 --> 16:56.122
or can everybody figure it out
for themselves?

17:00.190 --> 17:02.168
Why are you reading
that contract?

17:02.192 --> 17:05.279
I told you. Lonny wants me
to sign with this new agency.

17:05.303 --> 17:06.771
But you didn't say

17:06.796 --> 17:09.003
you were seriously thinking
about going with him.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.178
I know, I know.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.679
Just lonny's family.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.089
You know, he's always
been there for me.

17:16.114 --> 17:18.584
He paid my rent
when I was waiting

17:18.608 --> 17:20.386
for my first royalty check.

17:20.410 --> 17:22.188
He called me every day
when Karl left.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.050
I mean, I just owe him so much.

17:24.074 --> 17:25.357
Susan, he committed a felony.

17:25.381 --> 17:26.791
Okay, who in this room

17:26.816 --> 17:29.625
has not committed a felony?
Raise your hand.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.357
Ah-ah-ah, not so fast.

17:31.381 --> 17:33.059
Your agent represents you.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.730
You've gotta be able
to trust him.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.741
How is that gonna be
possible now?

17:36.765 --> 17:41.036
Well, it's possible because
I have faith in people.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.338
I mean, lonny knows
he messed up,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.310
and he's sorry.
He's making restitution.

17:44.334 --> 17:47.778
What, you don't believe people
deserve second chances?

17:47.802 --> 17:50.276
Not when they messed up
this much, no.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.619
Really? So that's it with you?
You just get one shot,

17:53.643 --> 17:56.122
and you screw up,
and you're out?

17:56.146 --> 17:58.284
I didn't know
you were such a cynic.

17:58.308 --> 18:00.386
Hey, I'm sorry, all right?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.650
I guess it's just
the way I'm wired.

18:03.813 --> 18:06.132
I got a job over in greenwood,

18:06.156 --> 18:09.316
so I'll call you later tonight.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.305
You okay?

18:19.329 --> 18:22.708
Julie...

18:22.732 --> 18:27.712
I did something bad,
something really, really bad.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.818
Aren't you gonna ask me
what it was?

18:32.842 --> 18:35.361
Do I ever have to?

18:35.385 --> 18:38.093
Last week when Mike and I
went to the park

18:38.117 --> 18:41.267
searching for Zach,

18:41.291 --> 18:42.498
I sort of found him.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.829
No!

18:43.853 --> 18:46.840
Yes, and I gave him money
and I sent him away,

18:46.864 --> 18:48.774
and I didn't tell Mike.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.437
Holy crap.
What are you gonna do?

18:51.461 --> 18:54.240
I don't know. What would you do
if this happened to you?

18:54.264 --> 18:56.247
See, this would never
happen to me.

18:56.271 --> 18:58.244
This kind of thing
only happens to you.

18:58.268 --> 19:00.786
Will you stop judging
and help me?

19:00.810 --> 19:03.149
Well, obviously,
you're gonna have to tell him.

19:03.173 --> 19:04.790
Well, I can't do that.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.792
You heard what he said
about his wiring.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.255
I betrayed him. He'll never
forgive me. Okay. Don't tell him.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.297
Well, how can I not?
I feel so guilty,

19:11.321 --> 19:14.430
I can barely look him in the eye
when he talks about Zach.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.794
So where do you think Zach went?

19:18.828 --> 19:20.188
Utah.

19:21.531 --> 19:25.311
Oh, lord. Why did I do this?

19:25.335 --> 19:28.195
I have a feeling
you did it for me.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.679
Hey, girl. I hope you are
in the mood for margaritas

19:55.703 --> 19:59.174
'cause it is salsa night
at O'Donnell's.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.308
Oh, fun. But I can't go tonight
because I promised the twins

20:02.332 --> 20:04.680
that I would help them
finish their science project.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.884
Lynette, if the late hours

20:08.908 --> 20:11.186
are going to be an issue
for you,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.188
we probably should
talk about finding you

20:13.212 --> 20:15.921
a less demanding account.

20:15.945 --> 20:17.923
You're gonna take me off kamarov

20:17.947 --> 20:20.195
because I won't go
drinking with you?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.197
No. Oh, god, no.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.670
Honey, I get it.
You have a family.

20:24.694 --> 20:26.711
Home has to come first for you.

20:26.735 --> 20:27.903
Thank you.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.276
I mean, for me,
the client comes first.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.538
Me being a perfectionist
is my own neurotic issue,

20:32.562 --> 20:35.416
and I know that I really
need to work on that.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.413
But trust me,
I will never sleep again

20:37.437 --> 20:39.615
if this campaign gets mucked up.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.639
I'll figure something out.
You go home. Have a good night.

20:44.374 --> 20:46.392
Nina?

20:46.416 --> 20:48.294
Yeah.

20:48.318 --> 20:51.226
I can handle the extra hours.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.759
Oh, Lynette. You sure?

20:53.783 --> 20:55.261
Yeah.

20:55.285 --> 20:57.255
I'll get my coat.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.338
Wow, this place is rowdy
after happy hour, huh?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.271
Yeah.

21:05.295 --> 21:07.543
Hey... look at that guy
right there.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.545
The end of the bar.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.547
The shoulders
with the tan jacket.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.419
Yeah.

21:13.443 --> 21:15.453
Go get him for me.

21:47.337 --> 21:49.307
Hey there.

21:57.917 --> 22:03.429
So they're going on about
Melanie foster on the news.

22:03.453 --> 22:07.733
It's time we talked about her,
Caleb.

22:10.099 --> 22:12.077
Until you start accepting
responsibility

22:12.101 --> 22:13.579
for what happened,

22:13.603 --> 22:17.473
you know I can't let you
out of here.

22:25.815 --> 22:27.815
What the hell is this?! Mom!

22:29.449 --> 22:31.597
Where are you?!

22:31.621 --> 22:34.400
I'll be right back.

22:34.424 --> 22:36.467
And I will expect you
to answer me.

22:36.491 --> 22:37.963
Where are you?!

22:37.987 --> 22:41.387
I'm coming! Coming.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.875
What were you gonna
do with this? Don't.

22:49.899 --> 22:51.877
"I know who really killed
Melanie foster.

22:51.901 --> 22:53.549
"You've arrested the wrong man"?

22:53.573 --> 22:55.050
What are you thinking?

22:55.074 --> 22:56.827
The police need to know
the truth.

22:56.851 --> 22:58.654
The hell they do!
This is our chance.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.786
We are good people.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.889
We can't let
an innocent man go to jail.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.796
Okay, you wanna do
the right thing?

23:05.820 --> 23:07.793
Well, then call 9-1-1
and tell 'em

23:07.817 --> 23:09.795
you got a killer
locked up in the basement.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.797
He is not a killer.
He was confused.

23:11.821 --> 23:13.799
He didn't know
what he was doing.

23:13.823 --> 23:16.447
He knows a lot more than
you give him credit for.

23:16.471 --> 23:17.803
I'm mailing the letter.

23:17.827 --> 23:19.445
Do you realize
what's gonna happen?

23:19.469 --> 23:23.549
Mom, are you
thinking it through?

23:23.573 --> 23:24.950
I'm mailing the letter.

23:24.974 --> 23:28.444
If you do, you'd better hope
to god they don't find us.

23:32.442 --> 23:35.090
'Cause they're not gonna care
how slow Caleb is.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.994
They'll just execute him.

24:08.017 --> 24:10.456
Lonny?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.858
Are you here? It's Susan.

24:12.882 --> 24:15.060
Lonny?

24:15.084 --> 24:16.532
Susan?

24:16.556 --> 24:18.203
What are you doing here?

24:18.227 --> 24:20.866
Well, I just came over
to give you the contracts.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.568
Your door was open.

24:22.592 --> 24:25.010
Oh. Great.

24:25.034 --> 24:27.021
Sorry this place is such a mess.

24:27.045 --> 24:31.617
I've been working here till
we get the new offices painted.

24:31.641 --> 24:33.619
Wait till you see them.

24:33.643 --> 24:35.913
They're gonna be
really beautiful.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.984
Where's Jeannie?

24:39.008 --> 24:40.986
She's with the kids
up in Minnesota

24:41.010 --> 24:42.488
visiting her mom.

24:42.512 --> 24:45.030
They love it up there.

24:45.054 --> 24:47.894
Keep changing the date
on dear old dad.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.469
There's no electricity.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.041
There isn't?

24:56.065 --> 24:59.244
Oh, I'm such a dummy.

24:59.268 --> 25:00.646
I've been...

25:00.670 --> 25:02.147
I've been so swamped,

25:02.171 --> 25:05.511
I must have forgotten
to pay the electric bill.

25:05.535 --> 25:07.583
Lonny...

25:07.607 --> 25:10.977
How much financial trouble
are you really in?

25:13.512 --> 25:14.842
I'm fine.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.493
You know what it is?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.526
I had to pay all those people
back at the same time...

25:20.550 --> 25:22.027
Restitution plus interest.

25:22.051 --> 25:24.600
It's not something
I'd recommend.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.572
It sucks you dry.

25:26.596 --> 25:28.604
I've gonna ask you a question,

25:28.628 --> 25:31.236
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.609
Did you steal from me?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.140
Absolutely not.

25:35.164 --> 25:38.744
Please don't lie. Just tell me.

25:38.768 --> 25:40.746
Is that what you want to hear?

25:40.770 --> 25:45.040
Do I have to say it
so that we can move on?

25:47.116 --> 25:49.524
Fine. I did it.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.197
But yours was
the first money I paid back,

25:52.221 --> 25:54.159
so the slate's been wiped clean.

25:54.183 --> 25:56.602
Let's just move past it.

25:56.626 --> 25:59.605
Suze?

25:59.629 --> 26:02.668
I'm sorry. I just can't
trust you anymore.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.640
Yes, you can! No, I can't.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.811
You can. Can't.

26:05.835 --> 26:07.573
Give me the contract!

26:07.597 --> 26:10.145
No!

26:10.169 --> 26:13.719
Okay, okay, fine.

26:13.743 --> 26:16.682
Aah! What are you doing?!

26:16.706 --> 26:19.685
Are you trying
to take me down with you?!

26:19.709 --> 26:22.187
I am not going down!

26:22.211 --> 26:24.660
My life is great!

26:24.684 --> 26:26.962
I have never been happier,

26:26.986 --> 26:29.164
and I've never been thinner!

26:29.188 --> 26:32.267
Get off me, you Amazon!

26:32.291 --> 26:34.761
Aah!

26:44.303 --> 26:46.281
What are you doing here?

26:46.305 --> 26:49.685
You left me a message.
You said you wanted to talk.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.818
Yeah, I thought you'd schedule
an appointment later.

26:52.842 --> 26:55.629
Right now I'm sort of
disgusting and sweaty.

26:55.653 --> 26:59.085
I'm a criminal lawyer.
I've seen worse.

27:08.658 --> 27:11.106
So did you find a new lawyer
for Mr. Charming?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.108
I don't want a new lawyer.
I want you.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.049
So does Carlos.
He just doesn't realize it yet.

27:16.073 --> 27:19.945
A 1988 romanée-Conti la tâche.
I'm impressed.

27:19.969 --> 27:23.118
Look, to be honest, Carlos is
a little threatened by you.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.620
He thinks if we spend
too much time together,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.694
that something... Might happen.

27:28.718 --> 27:31.326
Somebody's got
an active imagination.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.398
Corkscrew?

27:33.422 --> 27:35.839
David, we're not here
to drink wine, okay?

27:35.863 --> 27:37.332
This is business.

27:37.356 --> 27:42.037
Now you have to convince
Carlos that he can trust you.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.369
How am I gonna do that?

27:44.393 --> 27:49.314
I don't know. Tell him you're
happily married or... or gay.

27:49.338 --> 27:53.318
Yeah, right. You're a
lawyer. You lie to juries all the time.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.086
Can't you just make something
up? I'm past the point in my career

27:56.110 --> 27:58.784
where I have to beg for work.
I'm sorry.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.655
Okay, David, I'm holding
my marriage together

28:00.679 --> 28:02.157
by my fingernails.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.658
If Carlos serves
his full sentence,

28:03.682 --> 28:07.099
I don't think we're gonna
make it, so please, I need you.

28:07.123 --> 28:12.237
I'll say this much for Carlos.
He's got excellent taste...

28:12.261 --> 28:16.802
In wine. Montrachet.
It's good stuff.

28:16.826 --> 28:19.204
Are you gonna help me or not?

28:19.228 --> 28:22.407
We'll go see Carlos tomorrow.
I'll turn him around for you.

28:22.431 --> 28:25.010
Really? What are you gonna say?

28:25.034 --> 28:28.384
Play it by ear. I don't wanna
sound too over-rehearsed.

28:29.979 --> 28:31.957
Hey, that's my wine.

28:31.981 --> 28:34.841
Deduct it from my bill.

28:36.746 --> 28:41.066
It all started with
bad real estate investments.

28:41.090 --> 28:44.469
You should have just come clean.

28:44.493 --> 28:48.834
Yeah, well, you tell one lie,
the second one comes easy.

28:48.858 --> 28:51.907
Then you're making up new lies
to cover up the old ones.

28:51.931 --> 28:55.280
Pretty soon,
you can't turn back, you know?

28:55.304 --> 28:57.042
I do.

28:57.066 --> 29:01.386
When Jeannie finally caught on,
she took the kids.

29:01.410 --> 29:03.718
She took the furniture.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.782
The bank locked me
out of my own house.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.996
Wow.

29:11.020 --> 29:15.000
That's why I can't lose you
as a client.

29:15.024 --> 29:18.733
Well, I'm sorry, but you have.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.035
I don't blame you.

29:20.059 --> 29:23.338
You'll never lose
my friendship, though.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.070
I mean that.

29:25.094 --> 29:26.071
Really?

29:26.095 --> 29:28.974
Of course. You're my lonny.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.077
And you're my susie.

29:33.542 --> 29:35.502
You're my susie.

29:39.048 --> 29:42.828
Oh! What the hell
is wrong with you?!

29:42.852 --> 29:44.329
I'm your lonny.
That's what you said.

29:44.353 --> 29:46.892
Not likethat. But I thought...

29:46.916 --> 29:49.064
I mean, there's always
been this magnetism.

29:49.088 --> 29:52.167
No, there has not been,
and there never will be!

29:52.191 --> 29:54.269
Oh, my god!

29:54.293 --> 29:56.973
But I was just coming clean!

30:00.799 --> 30:03.278
Hey, Morgan!

30:03.302 --> 30:05.280
Got a letter from some guy

30:05.304 --> 30:07.391
claiming he attacked
Melanie foster.

30:07.415 --> 30:09.384
You ran me down for that?

30:09.408 --> 30:11.786
I got dozens of kooks
coming out of the woodwork,

30:11.810 --> 30:13.788
all saying we arrested
the wrong guy.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.922
This one knows about the ax.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.012
Here you go, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.014
Thank you.
The hearse is right outside,

30:39.038 --> 30:41.917
so if you'll just follow me...

30:41.941 --> 30:44.389
Oh, shoot. There's a form
I need you to sign.

30:44.413 --> 30:46.400
I think I left it
back in the office.

30:46.424 --> 30:49.015
That's all right.
I'll wait. Okay.

30:54.423 --> 30:57.232
I'm here, sweetheart,

30:57.256 --> 30:59.965
and I'm gonna take care
of everything.

30:59.989 --> 31:01.836
But you knew that, didn't you?

31:01.860 --> 31:05.540
You've always known
that you can count on me.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.042
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.945
Detective barton,
what are you doing here?

31:09.969 --> 31:12.878
Oh, just taking care
of some business.

31:12.902 --> 31:14.549
Is this...

31:14.573 --> 31:18.183
Yes. This is Rex.

31:18.207 --> 31:21.626
I-I wanna thank you again
for what you did.

31:21.650 --> 31:24.859
It was so refreshing
to be treated with kindness

31:24.883 --> 31:27.862
after weeks of just
ludicrous accusations.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.996
The doctor doesn't think
they're ludicrous.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.998
Well, I know,
but Rex died in his care.

31:33.022 --> 31:35.906
I mean, of course he'd like
to blame someone else.

31:35.930 --> 31:37.102
But the tests he did, uh...

31:37.126 --> 31:39.104
Oh, please don't talk to me
about tests.

31:39.128 --> 31:40.605
Rex was not poisoned,

31:40.629 --> 31:43.108
and no one I know
believes that he was.

31:43.132 --> 31:44.879
Rex did.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.912
What?

31:46.936 --> 31:49.214
Well, the doctor told Rex
he was being poisoned,

31:49.238 --> 31:50.956
and Rex believed him.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.587
How would you know that?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.111
Oh!

32:03.092 --> 32:04.369
Where did you get this?

32:04.393 --> 32:06.906
We found that in Rex's bed
after he died.

32:06.930 --> 32:09.095
That is his handwriting,
isn't it?

32:18.407 --> 32:20.515
You know what I think?

32:20.539 --> 32:25.991
Rex felt guilty
for the way he treated you.

32:26.015 --> 32:30.025
The adultery,
the public humiliations.

32:30.049 --> 32:33.458
That's why he forgave you.
He understood why you did it.

32:33.482 --> 32:37.032
How could he have believed this?

32:37.056 --> 32:39.034
Look, my wife cheated on me,
too.

32:39.058 --> 32:42.667
I know how much it hurts.

32:42.691 --> 32:45.510
And so will a judge.

32:45.534 --> 32:49.314
Everyone understands
crimes of passion.

32:49.338 --> 32:52.477
But every day that you stonewall

32:52.501 --> 32:54.479
makes you look more and more

32:54.503 --> 32:57.682
like a cold, calculating killer.

32:57.706 --> 33:00.986
We both know that's not you.

33:01.010 --> 33:05.150
But I can't help you unless
you start telling the truth.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.243
I'm sorry, but i-i, um,
I have to go.

33:18.267 --> 33:21.467
I have some things
that I need to take care of.

33:27.376 --> 33:30.355
Bree, it is obvious your husband
loved you very much.

33:30.379 --> 33:33.158
Don't you think you owe to him
to admit the truth?

33:33.182 --> 33:35.220
Detective, I know exactly
what my husband deserves.

33:35.244 --> 33:37.254
Now would you be a dear?

33:41.790 --> 33:44.220
Thank you.

33:59.168 --> 34:00.238
Okay.

34:02.611 --> 34:04.549
What's he doing here?

34:04.573 --> 34:08.022
I have a pitch for you.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.225
I wanna explain to you

34:10.248 --> 34:13.058
why I think it's in your best
interest for you to allow me

34:13.081 --> 34:14.599
to represent you.

34:14.623 --> 34:17.393
Oh, for Pete's sake, Carlos,
at least listen to the man.

34:19.628 --> 34:22.607
I guess it beats
sitting in my cell.

34:22.630 --> 34:26.741
Now I don't think you have
a problem with me as a lawyer.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.373
Clearly, I'm the real deal.

34:28.397 --> 34:31.376
I sense your problem
with me is more personal.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.078
You sense right.

34:33.101 --> 34:37.129
You wanna know if I'm interested
in sleeping with your wife.

34:37.152 --> 34:40.176
And the answer is yes.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.764
He... Carlos, he's kidding.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.735
Tell him you're kidding.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.768
Shut it.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.239
Now clearly,

34:55.264 --> 34:57.751
Gabrielle's willful,
self-centered and manipulative.

34:57.775 --> 35:01.476
She's also beautiful enough
to be worth the trouble.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.808
So the minute
we leave this room,

35:03.832 --> 35:05.810
I'm going to aggressively
pursue her,

35:05.834 --> 35:07.817
and when I succeed,
which I will,

35:07.841 --> 35:09.814
we're gonna fly
to my chateau in chamonix

35:09.838 --> 35:11.816
and have dinner
in a local bistro.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.319
They make the best raclette
in all of Europe.

35:14.343 --> 35:16.726
We'll make love by the fire
and afterwards

35:16.750 --> 35:19.724
do a little midnight skiing.
You ski, don't you?

35:19.748 --> 35:21.726
You're athletic. You'll learn.

35:21.750 --> 35:24.569
Anyway, all of this
only happens if you fire me.

35:24.593 --> 35:26.580
If you keep me on
as your lawyer,

35:26.604 --> 35:28.333
your wife's off-limits.

35:28.357 --> 35:31.606
I'd get disbarred for sleeping
with a client's wife,

35:31.630 --> 35:33.838
and nobody's worth that,
not even her.

35:33.862 --> 35:36.211
So that's my pitch.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.235
I'll let you think about it.

35:42.471 --> 35:45.119
Honey, I am so sorry.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.900
Honestly, that guy's insane.

35:46.924 --> 35:50.625
Boy, you just can't wait,
can you?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.427
What?

35:52.451 --> 35:55.600
He's my lawyer. But, Carlos...

35:55.624 --> 35:58.364
And that's all there is to it.

36:02.531 --> 36:05.531
♪♪♪

36:06.835 --> 36:08.313
How about a dance?

36:08.337 --> 36:09.814
How about it? Yes.

36:09.838 --> 36:13.318
Well, you guys have fun.

36:13.342 --> 36:14.849
This is the fifth night in a row

36:14.873 --> 36:17.360
I haven't been home
to tuck in my kids,

36:17.384 --> 36:18.823
so I'm gonna go.

36:18.847 --> 36:20.725
No. You're gonna stay put.
It is Friday night,

36:20.749 --> 36:23.458
and you have all weekend
to play with your kids.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.182
Watch my purse.

36:39.428 --> 36:40.405
Hey.

36:40.429 --> 36:42.176
I'm Chuck.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.909
Chuck, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

36:44.933 --> 36:46.411
Happily married.

36:46.435 --> 36:48.653
Well...

36:48.677 --> 36:53.358
Looks like we have got
something in common.

36:53.382 --> 36:54.382
Ugh.

36:56.685 --> 36:58.423
Chuck?

36:58.447 --> 37:00.517
Get your hand off my thigh.

37:02.251 --> 37:05.199
No, not up my thigh. Off it.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.672
Come on!
What's the matter with you?

37:07.696 --> 37:09.974
I'm not available.
And I'm not that easy!

37:09.998 --> 37:12.577
Well, what are you doing in
a pick-up bar at 10:30 at night?

37:12.601 --> 37:15.980
Well, I don't usually do this.

37:16.004 --> 37:17.987
Oh, come on, honey,
who are you kidding?

37:18.011 --> 37:20.745
I've seen you here every night
this week. You're a regular.

37:20.769 --> 37:23.688
At that moment
it occurred to Lynette

37:23.712 --> 37:25.490
that Chuck, though inebriated,

37:25.514 --> 37:26.991
had a valid point.

37:27.015 --> 37:29.754
The time had come to declare

37:29.778 --> 37:31.696
a war of independence.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.329
And the surest path to victory

37:34.353 --> 37:38.333
would require
an aggressive campaign

37:38.357 --> 37:40.234
of shock...

37:40.258 --> 37:41.806
And awe.

37:43.732 --> 37:46.719

38:45.424 --> 38:48.302
It's crazy here tonight.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.774
Don't you want to dance?

38:49.798 --> 38:54.308
No, thanks. I think
I'll sit this one out.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.481
Lynette savored her victory

38:56.505 --> 38:59.414
confident that she would
never again

38:59.438 --> 39:02.487
have to engage her opponent
on this particular battlefield.

39:02.511 --> 39:04.489
Ooh! I love this song.

39:04.513 --> 39:06.823
Here, hold my purse.

39:24.833 --> 39:27.680
Bree, where have you been?
We were starting to get worried.

39:27.704 --> 39:28.943
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.945
I was just attending
to some last minute details.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.418
Right this way.
Where are we going?

39:33.442 --> 39:35.420
To Rex's gravesite.

39:35.444 --> 39:37.431
Well, I thought that
this was his gravesite.

39:37.455 --> 39:38.923
I'm changing it. Why?

39:38.947 --> 39:40.925
Well, he did something to
upset me, and I want him gone.

39:40.949 --> 39:42.587
What did he do?

39:42.611 --> 39:44.459
You know, it's so unpleasant.
I'd rather not get into it.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.370
Have you seen these gravestones?
Some are from the 1800s.

39:47.394 --> 39:49.093
Just fascinating.

39:49.117 --> 39:51.095
Bree, wait, you're gonna
have to explain.

39:51.119 --> 39:53.759
Rex is dead. What could
he have done to upset you?

39:57.596 --> 40:01.506
My husband, the man I spent
my life with for 18 years,

40:01.530 --> 40:03.578
died thinking
that I murdered him.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.109
What?

40:05.133 --> 40:07.560
Yes, the cardiologist shared
this moronic theory with Rex.

40:07.584 --> 40:09.454
And Rex believed him!

40:09.478 --> 40:10.715
Are you sure?

40:10.739 --> 40:13.718
Yes, because he left a note
and it said, and I quote,

40:13.742 --> 40:17.722
"Bree, I understand.
And I forgive you."

40:19.988 --> 40:23.968
I spent 18 years of my life
with this man.

40:23.992 --> 40:25.970
How could he not know me?

40:25.994 --> 40:28.904
Well, maybe he was forgiving you
for something else.

40:32.901 --> 40:36.781
I have donenothing
to be forgiven for!

40:36.805 --> 40:40.184
I was a fantastic wife!

40:40.208 --> 40:41.586
When he was sick, I nursed him.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.718
When we were low on money,
I stayed within a budget.

40:43.742 --> 40:46.190
I cooked his meals.
I mended his clothes.

40:46.214 --> 40:48.784
For the love of god, I used
to check his back for acne.

40:50.519 --> 40:53.728
And that miserable
son of a bitch

40:53.752 --> 40:56.761
has the nerve to understand
and forgiveme?

40:56.785 --> 40:58.763
Well, the joke's on him,

40:58.787 --> 41:01.727
because I do not understand,
and I donotforgive.

41:05.564 --> 41:09.604
Hi. We're...
We're just going to a funeral.

41:10.699 --> 41:12.839
Right this way.

41:23.912 --> 41:25.459
Honey, I know you're hurt,
but are you sure

41:25.483 --> 41:28.032
you're not gonna
change your mind?

41:28.056 --> 41:30.665
I mean, there's no
turning back after this.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.767
If you think I'm gonna
lay next to someone for eternity

41:32.791 --> 41:34.769
who thinks I'm a murderer,
you're crazy.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.871
As far as I'm concerned,

41:36.895 --> 41:40.695
let him decompose
with strangers.

41:55.183 --> 42:00.725
Everyone in the world needs
someone they can depend on,

42:00.749 --> 42:05.499
be they faithful friends,

42:05.523 --> 42:08.163
determined advocates...

42:11.700 --> 42:16.010
Or a loving family.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.512
But occasionally in life,

42:18.536 --> 42:22.736
the people we thought would
always be there for us leave.

42:25.574 --> 42:27.752
And if that happens,

42:27.776 --> 42:29.754
it's amazing the lengths
we'll go to...

42:29.778 --> 42:31.778
To get them back.
