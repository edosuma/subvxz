WEBVTT

00:33.360 --> 00:36.440
MAX: How many thousands of years
has man been living an illusion?

00:37.760 --> 00:40.400
We live in a world of dreams,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.480
a powerful hallucination.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.200
We turn our backs
on the sensory world

00:46.200 --> 00:48.120
into which we have been born

00:48.120 --> 00:52.440
and choose, instead, to live
in a fantasy.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.480
A fantasy we call "religion".

01:39.000 --> 01:40.800
Get him.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.080
Catch the Jew. Come on.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.880
THEY PANT

01:43.880 --> 01:45.520
Get him.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.680
HE GRUNTS, MOANS

01:46.720 --> 01:48.680
Argh!

01:49.680 --> 01:51.480
Ugh! Ah!

01:52.720 --> 01:55.120
Jew boy. Argh!

01:55.120 --> 01:56.960
Oh!

01:58.280 --> 02:01.000
Hey, you! Get away from there!

02:01.000 --> 02:02.640
I'll call the police.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.960
HE GROANS

02:06.080 --> 02:08.160
What have they done to you?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.760
PIANO MUSIC PLAYS

02:22.760 --> 02:24.440
INDISTINCT CHATTER

02:31.400 --> 02:33.840
Strobl, have you met my son, Max?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.480
How do you do? How do you do?

02:35.480 --> 02:37.320
Strobl is the society's patron.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.760
Ah, of course.
You are the psychoanalyst.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.320
Excuse me.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.560
Oh, good evening.
I'm so glad that you...

02:44.560 --> 02:47.480
Everyone still says it
like it's a term of abuse. What?

02:47.480 --> 02:48.800
The P word.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.920
Last year, it wasn't
in their vocabulary.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.000
Most of them still have trouble
pronouncing it.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.720
I still don't understand
why you wanted to accompany me.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.480
What is it Freud says
about religion?

02:57.480 --> 03:00.320
He calls it infantile. Mm. Exactly.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.320
Why would religious relics
be of interest to you?

03:04.960 --> 03:08.360
Good evening, Max.
Good evening, Herr Liebermann.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.840
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Historical Society Lecture,

03:14.840 --> 03:18.400
generously funded
by my good friend Tobias Strobl.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.280
APPLAUSE

03:22.680 --> 03:25.240
Tobias has been my closest friend

03:25.240 --> 03:27.440
and my mentor for many years.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.720
And I'm deeply indebted to him
for supporting my private research.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.640
APPLAUSE

03:35.640 --> 03:39.760
Now, I am delighted to introduce
our speaker for this evening.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.040
Brother Stanislav
from Heiligenkron Abbey.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.240
Brother Stanislav is renowned
in Vienna for his brilliant,

03:51.240 --> 03:52.880
scholarly articles.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.800
And he's here to talk to us all

03:54.800 --> 03:58.920
about the monastery's great store
of religious artefacts.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.360
He's a bigot.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.680
A dangerous fanatic.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.160
The only thing that comes
out of his pen is pure poison.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.440
You wrote an article in
a Catholic newspaper.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.840
Do you deny it?

04:15.800 --> 04:18.320
No, indeed. Why, should I?

04:18.320 --> 04:20.400
Your writing is filth.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.040
Your mind is filth.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.560
You shouldn't be granted
a platform anywhere in this city.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.960
You would deny our guest
the chance to speak?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.840
I'd deny anyone the opportunity
to stir up hatred.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.840
Vienna has always been a place
of tolerance.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.520
Read what he's written.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.040
This man is a dangerous zealot.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.640
How have I offended you, brother?

04:40.640 --> 04:41.920
I'm not your brother.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.240
I'm a Jew.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.800
You quoted the Church Fathers
in your article.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.680
"The synagogue

04:51.680 --> 04:55.880
"is a temple of demons,
a criminal assembly."

04:55.880 --> 04:57.440
Perhaps we could deal

04:57.440 --> 04:59.120
with this matter privately,
gentlemen.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.920
Yesterday, in Leopoldstadt,
a young Jewish boy was beaten.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.440
The exact same reference was
scrawled on the wall beside him.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.960
"Demon."

05:06.960 --> 05:08.880
I hold you responsible.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.680
HE SCOFFS

05:13.680 --> 05:15.400
What have you got to say?

05:15.400 --> 05:18.440
"You do deny the Son of God.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.440
"How long, poor wretches,
will ye not believe the truth?"

05:23.520 --> 05:24.600
What?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.240
"You are the assassins of Christ,

05:27.240 --> 05:30.120
"a den of thieves,
a dwelling of iniquity.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.200
"A refuge of devils."

05:33.440 --> 05:35.920
You know the sermons?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.360
Very well.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.960
Let me quote the Torah back to you.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.120
"Thou...

05:49.120 --> 05:51.040
"shall pelt him with stones..."

05:51.040 --> 05:52.200
Oh.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.360
"and he shall die.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.880
"For he sought to make you stray
from the Lord, your God."

05:57.880 --> 05:59.920
AUDIENCE EXCLAIM, SCREAM

05:59.920 --> 06:02.800
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
Please.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.520
HE SIGHS

06:22.960 --> 06:24.440
Still awake, darling?

06:24.440 --> 06:25.760
How was it? The lecture?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.080
Not quite what we were expecting.
Oh?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.160
There was a slight altercation.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.760
At the Historical Society?

06:33.760 --> 06:37.120
I thought it was all stuffy old men
looking at statues of nudes.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.840
Well, anyway, goodnight.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.200
Goodnight.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.360
You want a brandy, Max?

06:45.360 --> 06:49.120
Erm, no, thank you.
I think I'll just go...

06:49.120 --> 06:51.800
Sorry about this evening. Sure?

06:53.200 --> 06:56.280
Odd chap, that heckler in the crowd.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.000
I know him from the Shul.
He's one of Korngold's brothers.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.440
Isaak.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.280
If what he said
about that monk is true,

07:04.280 --> 07:06.160
then I think he left
with his pride intact.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.440
Not sure the same can be said
for you and me.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.040
Goodnight.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.320
Night.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.320
MALE VOICES SING A HYMN

07:29.640 --> 07:32.040
THEY CONTINUE SINGING

08:09.600 --> 08:12.480
CLATTERING

08:29.400 --> 08:30.920
Who is it?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.400
Brother.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
Are you hurt?

08:50.400 --> 08:52.000
Stanislav.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.360
Dear God in Heaven.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.360
HE SHUDDERS

08:57.440 --> 08:59.560
HOOVES CLOP

09:07.680 --> 09:09.880
Haussmann. Inspector.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.720
His name is Brother Stanislav,
a young monk.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.760
He's been savagely beaten.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.360
The monk who found him says
he hardly recognised him.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.680
This is the Abbot.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.840
Inspector Rheinhardt,
Leopoldstadt Police.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.400
Father Abbot.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.520
Inspector,

09:28.520 --> 09:32.080
"The Lord our God will inflict
His curses upon us."

09:52.720 --> 09:55.080
Eternal rest to him, O Lord.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.520
He was severely beaten
with something.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.280
There is no weapon here, Inspector.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.440
This is the sacristy,
where we keep our sacred treasures.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.520
Who has access to this room?

10:16.520 --> 10:17.760
Who has the key?

10:17.760 --> 10:18.880
I do.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.400
Brother Killian is the Chamberlain.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.320
Brother Stanislav had a key also.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.920
He was in charge of this collection.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.280
No-one was allowed to view it
without his supervision.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.320
We need a postmortem.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.960
You can't take his body.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.720
I have to insist.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.760
I'm afraid we have very
strict rules here.

10:44.760 --> 10:48.120
He must be laid out
and prayers must be spoken.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.280
Please.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.200
Wake Dr Jaeger. Get him over here.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.240
Did you know Stanislav well,
Brother...?

11:12.240 --> 11:13.400
David.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.040
Ever since he came here,

11:16.040 --> 11:17.880
we took our vows
at about the same time.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.440
Tell me, did he have enemies?

11:24.200 --> 11:27.840
The teachings of Christ are open
to different interpretations.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.640
That wasn't what I asked.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.360
Brother Stanislav had some...

11:34.840 --> 11:39.360
..contentious views
on the messages of Scripture.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.240
And that made him unpopular?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.960
I was asleep.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.520
Dr Jaeger,

11:49.520 --> 11:51.720
this is Brother David,
the infirmarian.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.720
You're not permitted
to take the body,

11:54.720 --> 11:56.480
but at least you can have
a look at him.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.520
I'd say this man was beaten to death
with stones.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
A martyr's death.What?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.600
St Stephen,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.920
the first Christian martyr...

12:23.840 --> 12:25.680
..died by stoning.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.280
Any idea who did this?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.840
None of the brethren
are capable of such...

12:31.840 --> 12:33.760
..brutality, Inspector.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.720
There must have been an intruder.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.200
Have any of the doors
been broken down?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.760
Maybe someone climbed the wall,
found an open window.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.160
I need to tell them.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.560
What?

12:55.880 --> 12:57.200
What is it?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.160
There was an altercation.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.240
What?

13:02.680 --> 13:04.880
Brother Stanislav was threatened.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.440
A week ago, he reported it to me.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.360
And you never thought
of calling the police?

13:12.360 --> 13:14.360
We didn't take it seriously.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.920
Father Abbot, who threatened him?

13:20.920 --> 13:22.560
I need a name.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.880
RAIN PATTERS

13:39.800 --> 13:41.240
Three hours.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.080
Oh, no. Was it agony?Yes.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.560
Three hours I had
to be apart from you.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.440
My bad work was punishing me.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.760
Inspector Rheinhardt.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.080
What are you doing here?

13:55.080 --> 13:57.280
Sorry to disturb you,
Fraulein Weiss.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.680
I'm looking for Herr Korngold.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.600
I'm Jonas Korngold.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.920
Ah, it's Isaak Korngold I want.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.800
You're looking for me, Inspector.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.280
Isaak Korngold,

14:10.280 --> 14:12.880
you're under arrest,
Leopoldstadt Police.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.800
Is this about that monk?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.920
You're arresting me
for breaking a picture?

14:16.920 --> 14:19.280
No, for murder.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.960
Brother Stanislav has been killed.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.200
This...this is insane.
I...I didn't kill him!

14:23.200 --> 14:25.760
No, no, no, no, there must be
a misunderstanding. Let me go.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.480
Let me go.No, no, please.
Isaak...Isaak!

14:27.480 --> 14:29.480
Take your hands off him.
Forgive me, Fraulein.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.920
Must be a misunderstanding.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.560
Tell me about Brother Stanislav.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.160
Do you know him?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.880
I've met him. Where?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.960
The Historical Society.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.840
A week ago,
I went there to talk to him.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.880
Talk? Really?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.320
We have witnesses
who say different.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.280
He's a dangerous fanatic. Hm.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.120
He was preaching violence.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.760
So, you went there to threaten him.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.080
Where were you last night,
around midnight?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.120
I was at home.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.440
Any witnesses?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.480
No.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.520
Brother Stanislav was discovered
this morning,

15:26.520 --> 15:28.360
battered by heavy stones.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.880
Fractured skull, fractured limbs.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.160
"Shall pelt him with stones
and he shall die."

15:34.160 --> 15:36.840
Was that what you meant when you
threatened him with stoning?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.120
AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS

15:39.120 --> 15:42.080
You're a suspect
in a murder enquiry.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.880
You need to get yourself a lawyer.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.400
HE SCOFFS

15:49.000 --> 15:51.160
"They threw Daniel
in the lion's den.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.600
"And the King said....

15:54.600 --> 15:57.320
"..'May the God that you serve come
and rescue you.'"

16:01.400 --> 16:03.200
FOOTSTEPS

16:03.200 --> 16:04.560
Inspector.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.680
I demand you let me see him.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.840
Your brother has been arrested
for murder.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.800
Your demands mean nothing.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.960
Frauline.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.480
In a week then, Herr Schwarz.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.200
Clara?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.360
Max.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.680
Oh, please come in.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.040
Beautiful offices you've got.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.280
I see you've done well for yourself.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.920
I would have been the wife
of a successful doctor.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.760
Instead you're going to be the wife
of a successful banker.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.680
SHE SCOFFS

17:01.880 --> 17:03.680
You say it like

17:03.680 --> 17:05.120
they're easily interchangeable.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.200
How are you keep...? I'm sorry to...
Sorry. You go first.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.560
No. Please. No, you.No.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.960
Please, have a seat.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.720
I'm sorry. It must be awkward,
seeing me again.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.600
I see you often.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.680
I meant it's awkward for us
to be alone.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.120
I had hoped that, eventually,
we could be friends.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.080
I need your friendship
more than ever today, Max.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.480
Jonas's brother is in trouble.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.760
They arrested him for murder.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.520
What? Jonas and I were turned away
from the police station.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.960
They're refusing to release him.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.560
They say he murdered a monk.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.440
The allegation is ridiculous.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.360
He's from a respectable family.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.320
And they're going
to be my family soon.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.560
And how can I help, Clara?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.400
Go and see Inspector Rheinhardt.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.200
And say what exactly?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.960
Ask to meet with Isaak.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.560
If you're any good
at this psychology,

18:16.560 --> 18:19.000
you'll see at once that he can't
possibly have done it.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.560
I'm sorry.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.520
I am getting married
in a few weeks.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.200
Did you know?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.680
Jonas is heartbroken.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.800
He doesn't say as much,
but it's obvious.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.120
Please help me bring
his brother home.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.960
TYPEWRITER CLACKS

18:59.920 --> 19:01.600
The answer is no.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.560
You don't know what the question
is yet. Oh, sorry, my mistake.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.600
I thought you were about
to plead with me

19:08.600 --> 19:10.640
to release that fellow
from your synagogue.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.520
BOTH SIGH

19:12.520 --> 19:15.480
Max, it's a straightforward
murder case.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.240
There is no puzzle for you to solve.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.600
At least let me talk to him?

19:28.720 --> 19:31.160
That's usually when things start
to unravel.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.000
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

19:53.520 --> 19:55.120
Herr Korngold.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.360
We don't really know each other.
I'm Max Liebermann.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.640
I know who you are.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.040
You were engaged to Clara Weiss.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.960
Clara came to visit me.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.360
She thought perhaps
I could help you. May I?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.360
You know what
they're accusing me of?

20:18.200 --> 20:21.040
I swear to you I didn't kill him.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.760
He was preaching hatred.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
Yes, I was at that lecture too.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.640
I heard you threaten him.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.360
A young boy was beaten...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.680
..a child that I taught
at Hebrew school.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.840
Stanislav was responsible
for stirring up that hatred.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.440
I couldn't just do nothing.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.520
You don't understand, do you?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.080
You don't care about our religion.

20:49.880 --> 20:53.880
It's true,
I have no love for religion,

20:53.880 --> 20:57.040
particularly when it stirs men
to acts of hatred and cruelty.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.080
I'm going to plead my own case.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.840
I'm going to stand up in court

21:03.840 --> 21:05.960
and denounce Stanislav
for what he was.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.840
I know some people here -
perhaps I can help.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.800
I don't want help.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.560
And you,

21:15.560 --> 21:17.440
you don't owe me anything.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.680
No.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.120
But I do owe Clara.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.640
Perhaps this is how I can atone.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.960
He threatened Stanislav in public.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.200
A few days later,
the monk ends up dead,

21:47.200 --> 21:49.080
exactly the way Korngold predicted.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.480
He has no alibi, defence.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.440
What?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.640
He made that threat in front
of dozens of witnesses.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.360
You really think if he planned
to kill him,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.520
he would have issued
a public declaration first?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.680
This is not a psychology lesson.
MAX SCOFFS

22:03.680 --> 22:06.480
He's a deeply pious man, Oskar.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.840
He's devout.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.080
It's unlikely he's a killer.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.800
History is full of religious men

22:11.800 --> 22:13.800
raising their hands
against each other.Oskar!

22:14.800 --> 22:17.880
You expect me just to release him
based on your recommendation?

22:17.880 --> 22:20.680
You have to be sure. What?

22:20.680 --> 22:22.120
I have to be sure.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.840
Please. Go back to the monastery.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.200
Begin an investigation.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.560
Oh, Max. Oh, really?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.960
BELLS RING

22:55.520 --> 22:57.440
The police are here again.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.520
They're riding up to the gates.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.040
What are you going to tell them?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.520
They're not priests.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.160
We don't need to unburden our souls
to them.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.080
Stay silent.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.800
DOORBELL RINGS

23:46.040 --> 23:48.520
Open up.
I need to visit the murder scene.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.320
Let me in, Father. I must insist.

23:53.320 --> 23:57.160
I understand you already have
a suspect in custody.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.200
The investigation is just beginning.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.840
We need to garner all the evidence.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.000
I'm very sorry, Inspector.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.200
I can no longer permit you
to enter.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.560
What?
The sacristy is our holy place.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.760
The laws of man have no meaning,

24:12.760 --> 24:14.520
not before the laws of God.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.520
I can't have you trespassing
further... Father Abbot...

24:23.920 --> 24:27.080
The Vienna police have been barred
from our gates.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.040
None of you are permitted
to speak with them

24:31.040 --> 24:33.080
or discuss this matter further.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.200
A suspect is in custody.

24:39.320 --> 24:43.360
There is nothing to be gained
from intruding on our peace.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.400
Is that clear?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.160
Max.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.840
Clara's told us everything.
Have you been to the police?

24:56.840 --> 24:59.320
Yes.
I spoke with Inspector Rheinhardt.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.440
And?

25:01.920 --> 25:04.000
What happened?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.840
The investigation is ongoing.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.160
What does that mean?

25:09.160 --> 25:11.200
It means I told them
Isaak isn't responsible.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.520
Of course he isn't. And so?

25:13.520 --> 25:15.320
Are they going to release him?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.600
The investigation is ongoing.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.480
What's he meant to do?

25:22.480 --> 25:25.800
Just sit in a prison cell?

25:25.800 --> 25:27.520
Surely you could have done more?

25:27.520 --> 25:28.720
Leah.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.040
You're very kind, Max. Thank you.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.920
Yes, perhaps you should go home.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.480
Get some rest.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.760
I'll telephone
as soon as I hear anything.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.400
And good luck with your plans
for the wedding.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.360
Er, goodbye, darling.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.440
We're all praying
for his safe return.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.120
Max.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.600
Have you seen this?

26:04.520 --> 26:06.680
That family's reputation
is going to suffer.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.200
Korngolds used to be one
of the finest companies in Vienna.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.400
Used to be?

26:11.400 --> 26:14.600
Mark my words, people will begin
to withdraw their capital.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.440
Clara's future may be over
before it's begun.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.440
You still feel responsible for her.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.120
Apparently,
you have a suspect downstairs.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.600
Yes, we're still not ready
to charge him.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.280
The murder of a monk,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.320
it would be good
to have a result fast.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.200
Yes, of course, sir. But... But?

26:49.200 --> 26:51.120
Rheinhardt...

26:53.920 --> 26:56.640
..you're still in the doghouse
after that mess with the Russians.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.520
The evidence is all circumstantial.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.320
We have nothing to put him
at the scene.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.440
The city demands justice.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
Don't drag your feet.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.200
Herr Inspector. Haussmann,
can't you see I'm...?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.240
There's something going on -

27:35.240 --> 27:36.800
something I can't explain.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.440
The Abbot has issued a decree,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.680
he spoke to all the brethren today.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.840
He has sworn us to silence
over the death

27:44.840 --> 27:46.240
of Brother Stanislav.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.000
It is as if...
As if there is a secret.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.400
Yes.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.960
But I don't understand
what he's trying to keep hidden.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.720
Truth is not a luxury, Inspector.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.280
Truth must be at the heart
of our daily ministry.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.600
And so you came to me?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.680
How long have you known Stanislav?

28:09.640 --> 28:11.480
Ever since he took holy orders.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.800
Did you like him?

28:16.880 --> 28:18.320
He was...

28:18.320 --> 28:21.680
..he was very...devout.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.000
Everyone keeps avoiding my questions
when I ask about him.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.440
I am the chamberlain.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.120
I make sure that the brethren
have clean bedding

28:32.120 --> 28:33.640
and clean clothes.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.640
That is my mission.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.480
What was Stanislav's mission?

28:42.440 --> 28:44.480
HE WHISPERS
He taught that the enemies of Christ

28:44.480 --> 28:46.000
should be struck down.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.080
He was an extremist.
Misguided, I believe.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.360
But his murder is still a sin.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.400
So, how may I be of service?

28:56.520 --> 28:58.280
I need access to the monastery.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.040
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.040
HE CRUNCHES

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

29:17.120 --> 29:19.520
Only the chapel
and confessionals are open.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.640
The sacristy has been sealed.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.280
And what are you going to do?

29:26.280 --> 29:28.840
I applied to a Judge
for a legal order...

29:30.000 --> 29:31.960
..but that could take weeks.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.760
Surely they have members
of the order visiting

29:36.760 --> 29:38.120
from time to time?

29:39.160 --> 29:40.440
I suppose.

29:41.800 --> 29:45.080
Well, what if someone were to pose
as one of the brethren?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.440
HE CHUCKLES

29:46.440 --> 29:49.840
You want me to dress up Haussmann
in a cassock and surplice?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.240
No.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.400
No. No.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.640
Oskar, listen, at school,

30:01.640 --> 30:03.880
I used to go to chapel
with the other boys. So?

30:03.880 --> 30:05.480
Well, I didn't want
to seem different,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.200
so I used to pretend
that I was Catholic.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.880
I've said the Latin catechism.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.280
For God's sake, someone
has to get inside.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.320
You want to go undercover
into a monastery?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.880
Yes.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.160
What about your practice,
your patients?

30:23.160 --> 30:25.160
They're not exactly queuing up
at the door.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.000
Oskar, contact Killian.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.320
Ask him to help us.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.120
Persuade him to vouch for me
somehow.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.680
Please, Oskar.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.000
This may be our only chance
to help Korngold.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.640
I owe it to Clara.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.200
A conference?Mm.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.280
A symposium up in the mountains,
near Semmering.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.560
Well, how long will you be gone?

30:48.560 --> 30:50.200
A couple of days.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.440
Poor Clara.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.400
And you said you would help her.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.600
This does seem awfully callous,
you going now.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.320
But I thought...

31:02.320 --> 31:04.520
I mean, you said...I'm sorry.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.160
I thought we were going
to the opera?

31:06.160 --> 31:07.480
Forgive me.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.600
What is it that's so urgent
all of a sudden?

31:11.600 --> 31:12.720
Er...

31:13.840 --> 31:15.720
..if I gave you a reason now,
I'd be lying.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.800
Please don't ask me.
What's going on, Max?

31:18.800 --> 31:22.080
You plead with me for weeks
and months to go out with you,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.880
and when I finally agree,
you change your mind.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.480
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

DOORBELL RINGS

32:02.480 --> 32:04.200
Brother Maxwell, welcome.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.960
Brother Killian, my dear friend.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.800
Brother Maxwell of Oxford, Father.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.040
We made a pilgrimage together,
some years ago.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.920
Welcome to our monastery, Brother.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.080
MONKS SING IN THE DISTANCE

32:38.920 --> 32:40.520
Next door.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.760
Sadly, one of our brothers passed.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.400
That was his room.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.600
I trust you'll be content here.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.040
Yes, indeed. Thank you sir...Father.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.320
You're here from...Oxford?

33:10.600 --> 33:13.520
Yes, on my way to Assisi.
The pilgrim trail, Father.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.760
Where did you train in Oxford?

33:19.760 --> 33:21.680
Some years since I was there.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.120
Burford Priory,

33:26.120 --> 33:28.320
far outside the city, tiny place.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.600
I doubt you would know it.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.920
No.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.320
Indeed.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.680
This is for you, Brother.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.560
LOCK CLICKS

35:07.600 --> 35:10.320
Just a moment Herr Strobl.
I'll tell him you're here.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.880
Yes, thank you.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.200
I understand your reservations,
but, please...

35:19.080 --> 35:21.480
Please.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.480
HE SIGHS

35:21.480 --> 35:24.040
Very well.
I'll have your account transferred.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.360
Good day.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.360
Someone to see you.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.880
Oh, well,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.440
I have all the time in the world,
it seems.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.640
Another client cancelling
his account.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.320
No-one wants to do business with
us.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.680
Who's here?

35:43.400 --> 35:45.320
Herr Strobl.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.120
Herr Strobl?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.440
Tobias.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.480
Jonas, my dear friend,

35:51.480 --> 35:54.640
I feel so sorry
for what's happened to your family.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.960
How's your brother?

35:57.160 --> 35:59.480
Well, I wish it were me
instead of him.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.120
Yeah. I hear rumours.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.800
Business is suffering?

36:03.800 --> 36:06.040
Well, it's Vienna.
Rumours can kill a man.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.160
No-one wants to be linked
to a scandal.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.440
Please.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.600
Isaak is innocent, of course.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.240
Of course.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.920
But the stain can't easily
be washed from us.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.000
So, how can I help you, Tobias?

36:23.000 --> 36:26.520
Jonas, we've been friends
for such a long time.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.320
And I've come here to help you
if I can.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.080
That is very kind of you.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.560
But of course.Thank you.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.760
HE WHISPERS

37:13.840 --> 37:15.760
Brother Maxwell?

37:17.120 --> 37:18.880
You need to get into the sacristy?

37:20.480 --> 37:22.360
They're all in the refectory.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.440
Come with me. Quickly.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.400
Here.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.600
Has the room been cleaned?

37:44.600 --> 37:46.000
No.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.880
Well, he didn't die here.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.240
I saw his body, right here.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.120
There are no blood traces.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.680
You batter a man with heavy stones,

37:59.680 --> 38:01.840
the skin punctures,

38:01.840 --> 38:03.680
there's a great deal of trauma.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.760
There would be blood spray
everywhere.

38:07.880 --> 38:10.480
Is there any other way
into the sacristy?

38:10.480 --> 38:12.840
No, only through the chapel.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.480
No blood there either.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.080
Someone smuggled his body into here.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.720
I need to find out
where he was murdered.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.240
ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS

40:01.400 --> 40:02.680
Brother David?

40:02.680 --> 40:04.320
Yes?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.640
Brother Maxwell.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.400
From Oxford?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.760
I heard you were here.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.440
Everyone is talking.

40:12.560 --> 40:16.040
I...wondered if I could
have a herbal remedy.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.160
My joints are sore.
It's a long journey.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.800
Of course. Give me a moment.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.320
I'll find you something.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.800
I heard you lost
one of the brethren.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.040
Oh, stupid.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.720
Brother Stanislav, our Sacrist.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.960
He was attacked.
Right here in the monastery.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.720
Everyone is still rather...

40:49.720 --> 40:51.520
..shaken up about it.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.200
No-one knows how it happened
or who the killer is.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.560
I wonder...

41:02.560 --> 41:05.280
..may I be permitted to say
a prayer for him?

41:06.840 --> 41:08.560
Perhaps offer a blessing.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.440
What was he like?

41:15.440 --> 41:16.920
Were you close to him?

41:16.920 --> 41:19.240
These men are my family,
my brothers.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.760
Even Stanislav?

41:24.000 --> 41:27.200
They say he was an extremist.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.800
I gave him the same care
I would give to any of the others.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.520
He was sick last winter,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.240
took to his bed with fever.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.080
I worked hard to banish
the sickness.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.200
The fever clung on for weeks.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.800
What are those scratches?

41:46.960 --> 41:49.520
Is there any reason
he would be outside,

41:49.520 --> 41:51.000
beyond the walls?

41:55.920 --> 41:57.520
CAWING

43:28.000 --> 43:30.920
Well? How's the new outfit?

43:30.920 --> 43:32.520
Bit scratchy on the backside?

43:33.840 --> 43:35.240
Did you come here just to taunt me,

43:35.240 --> 43:37.080
or do you want to learn
what I've found out?

43:37.080 --> 43:38.840
No reason we can't do both.Oskar.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.320
Sorry.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.680
Sorry.He didn't die
in the sacristy.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.520
He was killed in the parkland.

43:44.520 --> 43:47.320
What makes you think so?
I've seen the blood.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.160
This rain may have washed away
the evidence.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.440
Wait for me at the entrance.
I'll show you.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.240
Why go to the trouble of dragging
the body back inside?

43:58.640 --> 44:01.120
I know, it's odd.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.360
Nobody saw his body being moved.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.080
The gates are sealed at night.

44:07.160 --> 44:09.040
There's no blood
on any of the floors.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.520
It's like a magic trick.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.440
We need a map,

44:14.440 --> 44:16.560
a detailed plan of the monastery.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.560
There must be another way in.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.880
Catacombs,

44:22.880 --> 44:24.400
burial chambers.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.800
Something else, Oskar.
Something more significant.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.360
What?

44:34.240 --> 44:37.200
A man leaves the safety
of the monastery walls...

44:38.640 --> 44:40.720
..and walks willingly to his death.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.520
What does that tell you
about his state of mind

44:44.520 --> 44:45.800
when he came out here?

44:46.920 --> 44:49.200
You obviously
want to answer your own question.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.720
I've known you long enough, Max.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.480
He was meeting someone he knew.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.960
Someone he thought was a friend.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.120
Then it's not Isaak Korngold.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.680
No. It's not.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.480
HE SIGHS

45:07.800 --> 45:09.160
What's that?

45:10.400 --> 45:11.920
Look.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.520
I can't read it.

45:18.800 --> 45:24.480
Enemy. It says the word, "Enemy."

45:24.480 --> 45:26.560
In which language?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.640
Hebrew.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.080
Saskia.
Frauline Weiss.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.800
Jonas.

46:16.360 --> 46:19.320
What's happening?
Why is everyone leaving?

46:19.320 --> 46:23.600
Things are moving fast, Clara.
I can't afford to keep them.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.640
Is it really that bad?

46:27.480 --> 46:30.200
"Killing a man in holy orders".

46:33.880 --> 46:38.280
The bank is mired in scandal.
Nobody wants to do business with us.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.480
Max can be very helpful,
talking to the police for us.

46:49.080 --> 46:51.800
I am very grateful to him

46:51.800 --> 46:54.800
but I don't want
to drag anyone down with us.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.240
What? What is it?

47:04.680 --> 47:07.560
I remember...

47:07.560 --> 47:12.760
..not so long ago, Max was drowning
in a scandal of his own

47:12.760 --> 47:15.480
and I was less than generous.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.960
Maybe I deserve
what's happening to me.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.680
No.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.840
No, no, no, no.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.760
Herr Korngold?

47:35.760 --> 47:38.200
What? He's here.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.200
Show him to the boardroom,
would you, Saskia?

47:45.720 --> 47:48.920
Somebody made me an offer to buy
the business.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.240
You're not thinking of selling up?

47:53.800 --> 47:55.560
Why didn't you talk to me first?

48:22.360 --> 48:25.040
Forgive me intruding
again, Brother.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.360
You want something from
the infirmary?

48:27.360 --> 48:31.560
Actually I...
I wanted to talk to you.

48:33.440 --> 48:39.080
I'm curious, did Stanislav
have enemies?

48:45.600 --> 48:49.640
"Blessed are you when men revile
you."

48:49.640 --> 48:53.720
Stanislav was different
from the others.

48:53.720 --> 48:57.720
Different how?

48:57.720 --> 49:02.880
He had a very rare gift.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.760
A gift?

49:04.760 --> 49:07.560
I am a healer, Brother.

49:07.560 --> 49:11.560
I use God's blessings
to minister to the sick.

49:11.560 --> 49:14.520
When Stanislav was at death's door
last winter,

49:14.520 --> 49:18.880
I tried to save him but I failed.

49:18.880 --> 49:23.320
Then, how did he recover
from his sickness?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.600
I am unable to explain it.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.640
Stanislav believed that he was
touched by a power

49:28.640 --> 49:30.720
that came directly
from heaven.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.560
A power?

49:32.560 --> 49:34.680
The Sacristy.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.720
He believed there was power there

49:36.720 --> 49:39.200
greater than you or
I could ever imagine.

49:41.360 --> 49:45.680
I grind herbs to make medicine,
but it's no miracle.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.760
You're saying Stanislav was touched
by a miracle?

49:48.760 --> 49:52.720
Jesus was led into
the wilderness and tempted.

49:52.720 --> 49:56.680
The devil, dressed in his finery,
said, "Show me a miracle."

49:58.440 --> 50:00.320
Excuse me, Brother.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.920
A magic trick?

51:54.920 --> 52:00.240
The body was somehow
smuggled down into the sacristy.

52:03.120 --> 52:07.600
I need architectural plans.
Do you maybe...?

52:07.600 --> 52:12.200
I don't have those sorts
of records in the archives.

52:12.200 --> 52:15.800
What about the city museum?
Department of Iconography.

52:17.920 --> 52:19.200
Of course.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.200
200 years old,
designed by Hildebrandt,

52:21.200 --> 52:25.320
this is a plan of the building that
houses all the icons.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.960
There must be a way inside that
we don't know about.

52:27.960 --> 52:32.480
Churches are some of the richest
institutions in the Empire.

52:32.480 --> 52:37.200
Heiligenkron Abbey has many
priceless treasures in its vaults.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.520
Believe me, it's impregnable.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.400
You knew Brother Stanislav?

52:46.880 --> 52:48.360
A little.

52:48.360 --> 52:52.160
I invited him to talk to
the historical society.

52:52.160 --> 52:55.640
His views were extreme,
to say the least.

52:56.720 --> 53:00.440
Do you think he was a man
who made a lot of enemies?

53:02.200 --> 53:04.800
Are you a Catholic, Inspector?

53:04.800 --> 53:07.120
Lapsed.

53:07.120 --> 53:10.000
Religion is less
and less fashionable, it seems.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.720
I spent my life studying
religious icons,

53:13.720 --> 53:18.520
but most of them no longer
have any real potency.

53:18.520 --> 53:24.080
Stanislav was a man of deep
and unshakeable faith.

53:25.280 --> 53:28.960
It's bound to have made him
unpopular in a world

53:28.960 --> 53:31.760
filled only with rationalists.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.840
There's something here.

53:38.240 --> 53:41.200
A sacristy was sometimes designed
with a watching chamber,

53:41.200 --> 53:44.840
a secret room to keep watch over
the treasures.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.400
A watching chamber?

53:52.400 --> 53:55.120
Hmm. Only the Sacrist
would know about it.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.760
It wouldn't be in
the architectural plans.

53:57.760 --> 54:01.160
It would just be a secret passed
down between the generations.

54:02.760 --> 54:07.440
It's not much to go on
but it's the best that I can do.

54:07.440 --> 54:10.560
I'll visit The Sacristy again.

54:10.560 --> 54:13.120
I have something for you.

54:13.120 --> 54:18.600
Stanislav burned some papers.
This is all that was left,

54:18.600 --> 54:20.720
this bit of gilding.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.720
Hmm, from a letterhead?

54:24.720 --> 54:28.480
He kept all his correspondence.
Why burn that one?

54:29.640 --> 54:31.880
You need to find
the owner of that crest.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.000
What are you doing?
Why are you following me?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.400
I'm sorry, I...

55:25.400 --> 55:28.520
It was you?
I heard you pacing outside my room.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.720
What are you trying to find??

55:30.720 --> 55:33.520
He asked me to watch out for you.
Who? Who asked you?

55:33.520 --> 55:36.400
Your friend, Inspector Rheinhardt.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.920
He said you often get into trouble.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.840
He mentioned something about
the Ferris wheel.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.960
KNOCKING

55:53.960 --> 55:56.320
Mm-hm?

55:56.320 --> 55:58.080
Ah, Rheinhardt.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.600
You wanted to see me, sir?

56:03.600 --> 56:06.920
The Korngold business has been sold
to new owners.

56:06.920 --> 56:08.960
Yes, I read about it.

56:08.960 --> 56:12.360
Well, I have
just been contacted by them.

56:14.560 --> 56:18.000
They discovered this.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.080
In their private papers -
a document in Hebrew.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.720
I've had an expert translate it.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.400
"Yimakh shemo".

56:28.400 --> 56:29.720
A Hebrew curse.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.160
Recognise the name that follows?

56:34.320 --> 56:36.040
Stanislav.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.440
It was hidden in their private safe,

56:38.440 --> 56:41.320
evidence of some ancient
Jewish ritual.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.520
We have to charge Korngold at once.

56:50.680 --> 56:54.040
What's the matter, Rheinhardt?
You're not convinced?

56:54.040 --> 56:57.320
There is some kind of conspiracy
at the monastery.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.360
What?

57:00.640 --> 57:02.200
I sent someone in,

57:02.200 --> 57:05.840
undercover,
disguised as one of the brethren.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.280
Who's the officer?

57:09.280 --> 57:10.400
Dr Liebermann.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.960
Liebermann.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.560
He was willing to assist.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.240
And you let him?

57:17.240 --> 57:18.680
Sir...

57:18.680 --> 57:20.920
A Jew in a monastery.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.600
A personal friend of the accused.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.160
What if the papers got
a hold of this?

57:26.160 --> 57:27.400
Commissioner.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.760
You're a fool, Rheinhardt.

57:29.760 --> 57:31.840
They're all bound
to stick together.

57:31.840 --> 57:34.360
They?How can we trust a word
that Liebermann says

57:34.360 --> 57:36.400
when the accused is another Jew?

57:54.400 --> 57:56.880
What is it you're looking
for this time?

57:56.880 --> 57:59.520
The answer to a riddle.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.080
We don't have much time.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.920
HE KNOCKS

58:20.920 --> 58:23.000
What is it?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.040
I'm not sure.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.520
Maybe nothing.

58:58.080 --> 59:01.040
Dear God in heaven.
Look at the blood.

59:01.040 --> 59:02.600
Stanislav's final journey.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.560
You didn't know this place existed?

59:07.560 --> 59:08.680
No.

59:22.520 --> 59:24.600
Two lines in the dust.

59:25.920 --> 59:27.560
The body was dragged by someone.

59:53.760 --> 59:56.040
Mystery solved. No magic trick.

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:08.960
We've found it, Oskar.
We've found the blood trail.

1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:11.200
Brother, will you hear
my confession?

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.880
Oh, sorry. Forgive me. But...

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:16.840
Dominus noster Jesus Christus te.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.400
KNOCKING

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:39.040
We found it, Oskar,
we found the blood trail.

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:41.480
The footprints in
the dust lead only one way.

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:44.640
Whoever dragged his body
stayed within these walls.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.880
You're telling me it was
one of the Brethren?

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:49.760
And I think I know who, Oskar.

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:08.120
WHISPERS: Brother, I need
to talk to you.

1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:09.840
Not now. Not here.

1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.080
I believe Stanislav's body was
dragged into the sacristy.

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.800
Perhaps by the same man
who attacked him.

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:22.600
You can't believe
that I'm responsible...

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:26.600
Or perhaps by someone who
discovered him hurt,

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:29.320
and believed a miracle
might cure him.

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:33.080
You told me it was
a place of miracles.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:43.320
Meet me in the infirmary,
after nightfall.

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:46.920
Oremus.

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:53.800
HE SINGS IN LATIN

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.560
You were right, Miss Lydgate.

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.320
A watching chamber,
built right under the monastery.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:22.160
Extraordinary.

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.560
Someone dragged him back inside.

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.480
We suspect the Infirmarian
knows more than he's telling.

1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:33.880
Murder! Murder!

1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:36.240
PANICKED BREATHING

1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:59.520
Another corpse.

1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:01.960
You can no longer bar me
from your doors, Father.

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:14.920
Multiple stab wounds.

1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.840
Rather unusual weapon.

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:21.480
Saint Cassian.

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:25.640
Another martyr's death.

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:28.200
What happened? Who discovered him?

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.520
He was found by
Brother Maxwell here.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:37.200
Perhaps Brother Maxwell
and I can speak in private.

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:39.000
Excuse us, please.

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.240
Brother Maxwell.

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.920
Do you think David was involved?

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:55.640
I think David dragged
the body back inside.

1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:58.800
Into the sacristy,
hoping for a miracle.

1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.160
Stanislav believed that place
had special powers.

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:06.680
And I think David had begun
to believe it too.

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.800
Oskar, I've been so stupid.

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:18.920
He tried to tell me
what he had witnessed.

1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.480
The devil, dressed in his finery,
said, "Show me a miracle."

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:26.520
He saw someone in the park that
night. He saw the killer.

1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:30.240
Have you examined the gilding?
Yeah.

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:33.760
And?
No match as yet. Why?

1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:36.000
Someone wrote to Stanislav.

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.320
A letter he subsequently burned.

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.880
Why write to a Sacrist?

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.480
Someone wanted access to one
of the treasures inside.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.720
There's something in that vault that
has the power to make men kill.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.800
We need to find what's missing.

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:55.560
Inspector?
I think you need to see this.

1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:05.880
So you want to go
on a damn treasure hunt?

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:12.160
Stanislav had access to the vaults.
That might be a motive for murder.

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.160
We already have our motive.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:16.720
Sir?
The curse.

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:19.160
Korngold's hatred of the monk.

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:22.560
It all adds up -
the ritualistic murders.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:24.960
Christian martyrs killed
by their enemies.

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:26.960
The Hebrew runes
left by their bodies.

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:29.720
It's some sort of Jewish ritual.

1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:37.600
Isaak Korngold is behind bars, sir.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:41.960
He couldn't possibly have done
the second murder.

1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:43.520
He had an accomplice.

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:46.080
Someone else returned to kill
the witness.

1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:47.520
Dr Liebermann believes...

1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:50.320
Liebermann was in the monastery.

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:54.120
He must be considered a suspect.

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:02.200
And the warrant to search
the sacristy?

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:04.920
If one of the treasures
has been stolen,

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:07.680
we'll look like fools
if we missed it.

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:16.040
I need the help of experts.

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:18.440
We're going into the vault.

1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:21.400
What are you trying to
find, Inspector?

1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:22.640
A miracle.

1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:35.400
Where's Max?

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.280
He didn't tell you
where he was going?

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:51.480
A woman in the monastery - you are
permitted in very few places.

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:04.480
I assume this is just a hobby.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:09.440
Otherwise you and I won't have much
of a future.

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:34.160
Extraordinary.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:36.920
These treasures shouldn't be
locked up here in the dark.

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:38.480
They belong in a museum.

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:40.600
You're seriously expecting
the Catholic Church

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:42.120
to surrender all its secrets?

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:50.840
So nothing is missing?
Everything as it should be?

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:54.120
Here's something.

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.200
The lock is scratched.
It's been opened recently.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:08.160
Sanguis et aqua.

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:09.520
Blood and water.

1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:20.160
Miss Lydgate.
Hmm?

1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:21.280
Do you mind?

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:23.680
Thank you.

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:29.720
Please be careful with it.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:51.400
Nothing mentioned in the inventory?
No.

1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:54.120
So, something obviously
has been taken.

1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:58.520
Do you know what it is?

1:08:58.520 --> 1:08:59.720
I do.

1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.920
I recognise the impression.

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:06.600
Look, here.

1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:08.520
No, it can't be.

1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:10.400
The holy lance,

1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:15.040
the lance that pierced the skin of
Christ, hidden here in the sacristy.

1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:16.640
Is it believable?

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:18.960
There are scores
of such relics all over the world.

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:21.920
I'm not convinced by its
authenticity.

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:23.560
It would most likely be a fake one.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:25.320
It doesn't matter if it's real
or not.

1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:27.440
All that matters is what
people believe.

1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:30.320
That's what gives it its power.

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.280
If someone thought it was here
and if they thought it was real,

1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:36.680
what would they do to gain
possession of it?

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:40.240
We found our motive.

1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:44.000
Gilded letterhead.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.600
Someone wrote to Stanislav,

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.560
eager to see this relic.
He smuggled it out to show them.

1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.600
Jesus tempted in the wilderness.
But he made a grave mistake.

1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:00.320
Yes, he was killed,
and the relic was stolen.

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:01.960
We have our answer, Oskar.

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:05.800
I think it's time we went
to confession.

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:07.680
ORGAN PLAYS

1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.600
Father, my name is Liebermann.

1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.960
Max Liebermann.

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:35.680
Is this some sort of trick?

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:38.520
Dr Liebermann was sent here
under the supervision of

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:39.960
the Leopoldstadt police.

1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:43.480
Thank you.

1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:50.480
Brother,
you vouched for him personally.

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:55.440
Yes, but I was eager to find
Stanislav's killer.

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:57.840
I helped Brother Maxwell live here
among us.

1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:00.520
You don't need to call me
Brother any more.

1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:03.280
Oh, I think I might use it in
the foreseeable future.

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.320
You brought an impostor
into God's house.

1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:09.120
I was determined to find the truth,
Father. Stanislav deserved no less.

1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:11.920
You have disobeyed me.

1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:15.080
You have disobeyed your vow.

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:18.480
Yes. And I truly beg
your forgiveness.

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.360
We need to know about the
lance, Father.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.400
The holy lance that pierced
the flesh of Christ.

1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:26.680
The monastery was in possession
of it.

1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:28.560
You've kept it a secret
all this time.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.200
Who knew that it was here,
other than you and Stanislav?

1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:39.120
You don't understand,
Inspector. There are hundreds,

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.200
thousands of so-called
religious artefacts.

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:45.800
Bones claiming to be
the fingers of our Lord.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.120
Wood from the cross,
nails that pierced his skin.

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:54.360
All over the world, people's faith
is being exploited by charlatans.

1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:56.480
You don't believe in its power?

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.040
Unusual, for an Abbot.

1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:01.960
Its power is to make innocent men
into fools.

1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:04.960
Worshipping false idols.

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:07.440
So you ordered it to be hidden.

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:08.960
And you prevented us from

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.520
investigating a murder within
these walls.

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.640
I knew you had someone in custody.

1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:15.520
I thought that it was over.

1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:18.840
I never dreamed that
the killer was still out there.

1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:21.160
Stanislav didn't agree
with your appraisal.

1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:25.960
He fell ill, some months ago.

1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:29.360
Brother David was unable
to help him. And then...

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:33.240
..Stanislav went into
the sacristy one night and...

1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:35.760
MAX: Was apparently healed
by a miracle.

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:46.560
After he was cured, he was convinced
of its authenticity.

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:50.560
He preached about the miracle to
everyone that would listen.

1:12:50.560 --> 1:12:54.280
Some of the Brethren
were persuaded. Even David.

1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:56.800
But not you, Father.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:57.920
I...

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.840
I ordered it to remain locked away.

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:10.160
I didn't want this sepulchre
turned into a circus.

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:13.360
He disobeyed you, broke his vows...

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:18.320
..shared the secret
with someone on the outside.

1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:22.840
That's why Stanislav was killed.

1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:25.800
He left himself vulnerable
to someone else's greed.

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:29.400
That relic has a power...

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:32.160
..yes...

1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:35.840
..but not for good.

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.000
Sir.

1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:55.920
What have you got for me?

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:58.000
May I? Yimakh shemo.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.760
The Jewish curse
found at Korngold's office.

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.680
What if it wasn't real?

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.080
What if it was all fabricated?

1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.600
There's dozens of cases in history

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.160
of Jews being wrongfully accused.

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:16.440
It's called a blood libel.

1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.200
Jews falsely charged
with murdering Christians,

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:21.400
unjustly executed.

1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:23.840
Medieval crimes that
have been stage-managed,

1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:26.120
just to frame someone.

1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:27.640
Look at the evidence.

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:32.400
So you think our killer
is a historian?

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.680
This dagger's a fake.

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:49.440
A good one, though.

1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.680
How can you be sure?

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:54.400
Very few layers of dirt
and corrosion.

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.960
I'll write to the museum
in Graz and tell them.

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:00.440
Well done, Miss Lydgate.

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:07.240
What's on your mind, Max?

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:10.160
I'm thinking about
the profile of the killer.

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:13.760
Someone naive enough to believe
in the power of miracles?

1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:17.240
Someone who, in this cold,
rational world still clings on to

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:20.760
the notion that God
is mightier than man.

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:24.960
Oh, I'm late.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:29.040
I promised Amelia I'd
take her out tonight.

1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:32.600
My penance for taking holy vows.
She's very punctual.

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:34.560
Forgive me, Oskar. Goodnight.

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:37.680
Goodnight, Brother Maxwell.

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:44.240
BELL RINGS

1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:56.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
the museum is closing.

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.160
Please make your way to
the entrance, the museum is closing.

1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:02.960
Ow.

1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:39.800
What's this?

1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:42.640
Something very precious to me,
Miss Lydgate.

1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:53.720
Sorry, the museum is closed.

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:56.920
It's only two minutes past.

1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.800
No, no, no.
Well, I'm here for Miss Lydgate.

1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:02.360
The museum is closed.
Try the staff entrance.

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.720
You want to know what I'm planning
for you?

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:22.120
"Is he mad enough to kill me?"

1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:25.160
I suppose there is a kind of
madness that took hold of me.

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:37.080
The holy lance that pierced
the skin of Christ.

1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.400
The spear of destiny

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:46.680
that brought forth blood and water.

1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:53.480
Modern science is
a terrible scourge.

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:58.040
We have become a nation
of rationalists.

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:02.160
I've devoted my entire life to

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:06.280
the study of religious relics,
always hoping, always wanting

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:09.800
to believe that they were more
than just folk tales

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.960
and fairy stories.

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:17.440
And then I met the monk Stanislav.

1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:23.120
He swore to me he had found
a true miracle.

1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:26.480
I wrote to him, asking to see it.

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.440
I tell you...

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:37.240
..I was powerless in its presence.

1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:41.120
I had to possess it.

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:47.400
I suppose you can call it
a kind of religious fervour.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:50.160
Is it madness?

1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:57.360
Dr Liebermann would doubtless
have a name for it.

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.680
I didn't mean to kill him.

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:01.440
I pushed him.

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:03.680
He tripped.

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:05.720
It happened in a moment.

1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.360
And now I...

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:14.160
..I had no choice but to run away.

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:20.520
Now you know.

1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.520
Perhaps, before I do,

1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:34.200
together we could find out
the truth.

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:38.200
Can we turn our backs

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:42.240
on a chance to witness a miracle,
Miss Lydgate?

1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:45.600
When I cut your flesh,
then holy water will spring forth.

1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:47.600
MUFFLED SCREAM

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.160
Priel. Get away from her.

1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:51.520
Don't touch it.
Don't you dare touch it!

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:06.600
Max, I'm fine. Get him.
Go after him.

1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.600
Priel.

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:40.000
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.480
And Brother David?

1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:43.400
I'm not responsible for that.

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:53.280
I absolved myself.
I confessed my sin.

1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:56.640
To whom? Who did you tell,
Professor?

1:20:57.960 --> 1:20:59.680
Professor?

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:01.080
No!

1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:03.560
HE SCREAMS

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:12.640
Priel told someone else about what
happened with Stanislav.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:15.000
Someone else is...

1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.760
You're not telling me
we've got the wrong man?

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:22.080
Someone else is involved, Oskar.

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.120
Who else benefitted?

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.720
Who had an opportunity to leave
the Hebrew letters?

1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:38.560
If you thought you'd killed someone,
who would you tell?

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:41.600
A mentor?

1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:42.960
A friend?

1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:46.960
David told me who he saw that night.

1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:52.440
The devil dressed in finery.

1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:55.320
Oskar, only one person
had the opportunity

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:58.200
to plant that curse
in Korngold's office.

1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:27.560
KNOCK AT DOOR

1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:30.640
Gentlemen? How can I help you?

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:32.440
Good evening, Herr Strobl.

1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:33.720
Good evening.

1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.920
You've taken over
the business here?

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:40.480
Yes. I'm now the major shareholder.

1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:46.520
It's a pity the Korngold brothers'
reputation must suffer,

1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:48.360
but I was able to take on
their debts.

1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:53.800
You mean you've capitalised
on their losses.

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.080
Why not? This is business.

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:01.920
He came to you, didn't he?

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:03.480
Excuse me?

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.200
Priel.

1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:07.520
He came to you as his patron,

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:10.120
as his closest friend.

1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:15.480
When he thought he'd
killed the monk.

1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:19.440
He came to you that very same night
and confessed it all.

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:22.400
That it was so easy for you.

1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:25.600
You remembered the threat
Isaak Korngold had made,

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:30.480
and in that moment,
you conceived of a plan.

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:33.480
To make it look as if
Korngold was responsible,

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.320
instead of your friend.

1:23:35.320 --> 1:23:37.160
What did you do?

1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:40.400
Go back to the parkland, take a
stone and make it look

1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:42.600
exactly like the stoning.

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:44.840
that Korngold threatened
to inflict on him?

1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:50.440
You scratched the Hebrew letters
into the rock

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:53.240
to lead us straight to Korngold.

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:56.320
And of course, you let your good
friend Priel believe he was

1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:59.680
the killer.
But you finished Stanislav off,

1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:03.880
just so you could lay your hands
on this business.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:07.080
And of course, you were told there
had been a witness.

1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:10.760
You knew you had to act.

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.720
Good evening, Brother David.

1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:39.120
This is absurd.

1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:44.160
You have no proof of any of this.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:48.600
We have the document you forged,
the blood libel.

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:51.880
And we have a scientist who can
extract evidence

1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:54.840
of the author from any parchment.

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:05.960
You tried to stab me - all right.

1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:16.960
Your hat.

1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:09.520
Inspector.

1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:43.280
I'm sorry to intrude, Max.

1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:47.840
I shouldn't really be here.

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:51.920
No, it's fine.
I was just on my way out.

1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:55.080
I'm meeting someone for dinner.

1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:57.840
I won't keep you a moment.
I just, I...

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:02.560
Isaak was released
from custody today.

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:07.400
My carriage just seemed
to steer its way over here.

1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:13.000
I had to see you alone
one last time.

1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:16.400
I...

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:20.200
Um...

1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:21.720
There's no need to thank me.

1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:25.400
I was happy to do it.

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:28.120
Well, not happy...

1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:35.360
Jonas doesn't know I'm here.

1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:38.080
And he wouldn't have
wanted me to come.

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:21.280
Drive.
