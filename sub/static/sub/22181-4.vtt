00:01.502 --> 00:02.770
[Kara] My name is Kara Zor-El.

00:02.803 --> 00:06.274
I'm from Krypton.
I'm a refugee on this planet

00:06.307 --> 00:09.177
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin,

00:09.210 --> 00:11.145
but my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.179 --> 00:14.082
And by the time I got here,
my cousin had already grown up

00:14.115 --> 00:16.384
and become Superman.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.088
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:20.121 --> 00:23.491
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.524 --> 00:27.161
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media,

00:27.195 --> 00:30.298
but in secret, I work with
my adopted sister for the DEO

00:30.331 --> 00:32.466
to protect my city
from alien life

00:32.500 --> 00:35.203
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.073
I am Supergirl.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.376
Previously on Supergirl...

00:42.410 --> 00:43.411
Ruby!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.783
I can picture our life together

00:49.817 --> 00:51.085
but there aren't kids
in that picture.

00:51.119 --> 00:54.555
I guess you have to let me know
if you feel the same way.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.157
I do.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.797
[indistinct announcement on PA]

01:03.831 --> 01:05.166
That your wife?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.537
Yeah... We're pregnant.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.273
[scoffs] Oh, isn't that cute?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.208
"We're pregnant."

01:14.242 --> 01:17.545
Like you have anything to do
with her damn life,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.547
not to mention
what's growing in her uterus.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.149
Excuse me?

01:21.182 --> 01:25.886
Look, I'm sorry, all right,
but I know you.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.223
I've been you.
Pretty wife, nice car.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.458
I'm guessing you drive
a Beemer?

01:33.327 --> 01:34.162
Look.

01:35.329 --> 01:39.200
Take it from me.
It's all a crock.

01:39.233 --> 01:44.172
The dream... You get
a good job, mortgage, family.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.774
You work hard, right?
Right? You hustle.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.376
You think you're
building something,

01:48.409 --> 01:52.112
meanwhile your wife's
screwing her personal trainer.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.553
And then you tank your job
and here you are.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.223
In coach.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.293

02:19.373 --> 02:21.442
[pilot] Flight attendants
brace for impact!

02:43.764 --> 02:46.166
[praying indistinctly]

03:01.282 --> 03:03.217
[all clapping]

03:07.955 --> 03:10.791
Everyone, it's all right.
It's okay!

03:10.824 --> 03:12.560
I'm FBI, it's gonna be okay.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.224
[upbeat rock music playing]

03:50.631 --> 03:52.966
Come on, Ruby.
Get 'em, baby girl! Yeah!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.468
[cell phone ringing]

03:54.968 --> 03:56.236
Hello?

03:56.270 --> 03:59.807
Well, if JQB has a problem
with the conditions
of the deal,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.009
they can call me
directly, anytime.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.380
[all cheering]

04:06.747 --> 04:08.349
Mom, did you see that?

04:09.383 --> 04:12.286
Yes! Amazing. Good job, baby.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.923
Yes, Paul. No, I'm still here.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.360
Yes, you can send
the final docs to
my assistant this afternoon.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.362
Which one is yours?

04:21.395 --> 04:25.533
Oh, uh, she's the forward,
right there.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.368
I swear to God I don't know
how she's so coordinated.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.304
I struggle to think and chew
at the same time.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.672
How about you?
Which one's yours?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.442
Ruby is special.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.979
Yeah, she is...

04:39.012 --> 04:42.049
Wait-- I don't think
I told you her name.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.453
She is chosen. So are you.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.492
I'm sorry,
who did you say you were...

04:51.525 --> 04:52.960
A follower.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.498
Please, bring Ruby to
our community so that
she may learn her path.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.368
Thanks.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.610
I just have to sign some papers
and then we can get back
to work.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.844
Yeah, no problem.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.614
But my boss really
doesn't like when
I'm late, so...

05:13.647 --> 05:15.583
-[Sam] Sorry!
-Hey.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.651
Ruby had a soccer game
and then the kids

05:17.685 --> 05:19.052
wanted to get ice cream
to celebrate...

05:19.086 --> 05:20.754
No worries. You remember Kara?

05:20.788 --> 05:22.423
Yes. Of course I do!

05:22.456 --> 05:23.624
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.794
Okay, so the JQB merger
should be finalized any minute.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.464
Unless Paul tries
to pull something,
which I will not allow.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.401
Ugh. Paul's like the one thing
I do not miss.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.738
-Skeezeball lawyer.
-Ah, gotcha.

05:37.771 --> 05:43.444
So how do you plan on
celebrating your first big
merger as my CFO?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.513
We're having a girls night
at my place tonight.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.714
Do you wanna come?

05:46.747 --> 05:49.483
No, I couldn't intrude...

05:49.517 --> 05:51.452
You do realize Lena's not gonna

05:51.485 --> 05:53.787
-take no for an answer, right?
-Accurate.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.122
[all chuckle]

05:55.155 --> 05:58.392
Okay. All right, I'll go. Um...

05:58.426 --> 06:01.028
-What should I bring?
-Booze.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.163
Just no tequila, okay?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.098
Where did you get this?

06:05.132 --> 06:08.636
Oh, some weirdo
at Ruby's soccer game.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.872
She came up to me, tried
to enlist me in some
self-help meeting...

06:11.905 --> 06:13.474
I hate those things.

06:13.507 --> 06:17.144
Like a waste of trees
and of our time.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.713
-You mind if I keep this?
-Yeah. Go ahead.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.914
See you later.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.788
What do you say
we go fight some crime?

06:27.821 --> 06:28.856
Nothing to fight, dude.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.925
I've been on the
police dispatch all day and--

06:31.959 --> 06:33.727
crickets. So...

06:33.761 --> 06:35.463
Mmm, bowling?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.499
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.933
Kara, what're you
still doing here?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.570
I thought you already
turned in your piece
for the hospital closure.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.806
-I did. Uh, this is
something personal.
-Whoa.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.542
-Hey, here did you get this?
-[James] What's that?

06:48.576 --> 06:51.111
It's the Kryptonian
symbol for Rao.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.212
-The God of Krypton.
-Yeah, I know.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.481
But what's it doing
on a pamphlet?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.483
That's what I've been trying
to research all afternoon.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.617
I can't find anything.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.820
Just a time and an address.
That's kinda ominous.

06:59.853 --> 07:03.691
Just how ominous it is...
I'm about to find out.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.460
Wait, wait, you're gonna...
You're going to go there?

07:06.494 --> 07:07.995
We're coming with you.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.030
I don't need your protection.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.632
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah, we know.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.612
[indistinct chatter]

07:30.083 --> 07:31.719
Looks like an AA meeting...

07:32.285 --> 07:33.921
Aliens Anonymous.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.658
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.927
Are you new here?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.629
-Yeah.
-Lucky you.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.498
-My first meeting
was transformative.
-Really?

07:44.532 --> 07:48.235
So, what exactly happens
during the meetings?

07:48.268 --> 07:49.937
Oh... Um...

07:49.970 --> 07:54.642
It's actually more powerful
if you experience it yourself.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.548
-It's starting! Sit.
-[Kara] Okay.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.723
Welcome, children of Rao.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.226
This is starting
to feel a little...

08:13.260 --> 08:15.529
-Cult-y?
-Yeah.

08:15.563 --> 08:19.533
We are here,
all of us, by Her grace.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.538
We are here together,
standing in the light,

08:24.572 --> 08:26.039
for just one reason.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.909
We are here

08:29.610 --> 08:31.812
because Supergirl saved us.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.555
Let us begin

08:41.589 --> 08:44.024
by reaffirming our faith.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.560
Though we go forth alone,

08:46.594 --> 08:49.630
our soul unites

08:49.663 --> 08:52.866
under Rao's gladsome rays.

08:56.336 --> 09:00.007
[both] For Rao
sees all, feels all.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.043
His love is eternal.

09:03.076 --> 09:08.148
May Rao protect us
so that we might
protect others.

09:10.618 --> 09:14.054
[Coville] Many of us
don't get second
chances in life.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.323
Many of us stay lost.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.593
And I'm not talking about
driving around in circles

09:19.627 --> 09:23.897
because you are running out
of gas and you have no GPS.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.267
I'm talking about
being spiritually lost.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.237
And needing
to find your way back home.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.306
Like Olivia.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.710
Don't be shy.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.616
It's okay.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.020
Hello.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.059
Uh... It was, um...

09:52.993 --> 09:54.294
It was spring break

09:54.327 --> 09:58.298
when I caught my boyfriend
cheating on me
with my best friend.

09:58.331 --> 10:03.070
And I took it hard.
I snuck into a rooftop party.

10:03.103 --> 10:07.708
And I got totally wasted and
I stood on the ledge as a joke.

10:10.678 --> 10:14.782
And the ext thing I knew,
I was falling...

10:16.383 --> 10:19.286
And as I fell,
I thought, I hoped,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.321
if this is it, that it's quick.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.224
But it wasn't quick.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.294
And that fall
lasted an eternity.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.232
And then She caught me.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.936
And She told me that everything
is going to be okay.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.672
Because of Supergirl,

10:39.372 --> 10:42.710
I realized
I still deserved to be loved.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.881
Supergirl saved me.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.382
[all applauding]

10:50.884 --> 10:52.652
Do you remember saving her?

10:54.421 --> 10:55.723
I...

10:55.756 --> 10:57.124
I remember all of them.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.893
And now, every day,

10:59.927 --> 11:02.863
our Sister Olivia
lives in the light

11:02.896 --> 11:05.365
of Rao's presence on Earth...

11:05.398 --> 11:09.302
The light that shines
through Supergirl.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.444
In the name of Supergirl,
our Savior...

11:17.477 --> 11:20.480
[all] In the name of Supergirl,
our Savior...

11:20.513 --> 11:23.283
-We give thanks.
-[all] We give thanks.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.854
Wait a minute.
Who exactly
are they praying to?

11:27.520 --> 11:28.722
Me.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.691
They're praying to me.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.831
Okay. So I ran
facial recognition.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.200
Thomas Coville, 44 years old.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.435
Born and raised
in National City.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.337
Definitely not an alien,
no offense.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.840
Any red flags, Agent Schott?
Criminal record? Arrests?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.743
Well, he was pretty much
a boy scout until about
three years ago

11:49.777 --> 11:52.813
when his wife filed for divorce
and then his life fell apart.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.916
Uh, let's see.
He was disbarred
from practicing law

11:55.949 --> 11:57.484
after a string of
misdemeanor convictions

11:57.517 --> 11:59.820
for public drinking
and disorderly conduct.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.922
[Kara] I don't understand
how that connects to Supergirl.

12:01.955 --> 12:02.956
I don'tremember saving him

12:02.990 --> 12:04.758
and trust me, I would remember.

12:04.792 --> 12:08.095
That is right, yes,
you didn't save him
as an individual.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.230
But I looked
into mass emergencies

12:10.263 --> 12:12.232
that Supergirl intervened in,
you know,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.802
burning buildings,
colliding trains, the usual.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.337
And I dug a little deeper...

12:17.370 --> 12:21.108
-Thomas Coville
was on Flight 237.
-[Kara gasps]

12:21.141 --> 12:23.343
What's so important
about Flight 237?

12:23.376 --> 12:26.279
[Kara] It's the flight
Alex was on that I saved.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.816
The night I became Supergirl.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.183
So, now we know

12:30.217 --> 12:31.318
why Coville is the leader of a
religion that worships
Supergirl.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.387
But it's not a religion, J'onn.
It's a cult.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.524
He's taking the teachings
of Rao and twisting them.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.794
Yeah, and how does he know
so much about it, right?

12:40.828 --> 12:43.797
And I don't mean just
the symbol, but I'm talking
about the sacred texts.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.400
Coville's handing out pamphlets
and recruiting people

12:47.434 --> 12:50.003
that've been saved by Supergirl
into his "Cult of Rao."

12:50.037 --> 12:51.404
He's got to have a motive.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.807
Winn, can you
keep digging on Coville?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.208
I can dig it.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
[Sawyer] Who is it?

12:58.411 --> 13:01.815
So, this very handsome
world leader who I shall
not name

13:01.849 --> 13:04.551
invites me to dinner
at The Baldwin where
he's staying, right?

13:04.584 --> 13:07.821
So we get there
and he tells me he has this

13:07.855 --> 13:10.157
very important question
he has to ask me.
And I'm thinking,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.925
"Okay, well, he's going to
invite me up to his room."

13:11.959 --> 13:13.827
So I'm considering my answer,

13:13.861 --> 13:18.031
when he turns around
and asks me if I was baptized.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.032
-What?
-Yeah.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.100
-No.
-Yes, yes.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.004
So I just burst out laughing
and said no, but...

13:24.037 --> 13:27.975
and apparently,
he only sleeps
with good Catholics.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.977
-That's insane.
-Yeah. Actually,

13:30.010 --> 13:32.913
I kind of found it attractive
that he believed in something.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.547
So, cool with that.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.383
What about you, Kara?
Are you seeing anyone?

13:38.051 --> 13:41.321
Uh... I'm actually

13:41.354 --> 13:43.556
still getting over
a relationship.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.193
He moved away.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.864
What about Ruby's father?
Is he still in the picture?

13:50.898 --> 13:52.933
Nope. It's just me and Ruby.

13:52.966 --> 13:57.204
Wow. Raising a daughter
by yourself, that's incredible.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.940
-Yeah.
-I mean, how do you do that?

13:59.973 --> 14:04.144
Uh, not very gracefully.
I'm always behind on something.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.180
You guys will see
when you have kids.

14:07.214 --> 14:11.318
Well, actually,
we're not gonna have kids.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.055
Yeah, we'll just be
the cool aunts.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.025
Great, I mean, that would...
Ruby would love that.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.193
Also sorry for assuming...

14:20.227 --> 14:21.594
No worries.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.099
Put me down
for another cool aunt.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.902
Len is a slightly nerdier aunt.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.370
[laughing]

14:30.403 --> 14:33.974
Wow, you guys are amazing.
That's very cool.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.043
[sirens wailing in distance]

14:36.409 --> 14:37.945
I, uh...

14:38.511 --> 14:40.313
I think I should get some ice.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.050
Yes, yes you definitely
should do that.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.451
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.430
[coughing]

15:10.110 --> 15:11.678
[cracking]

15:11.711 --> 15:13.513
[screaming]

15:25.158 --> 15:26.526
I was waiting for you.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.665
[Olivia] You did it, babe!

15:33.666 --> 15:36.369
-She saved you!
-I knew she would.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.005
I never lost faith.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.439
[Olivia] You're one of us now.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.209
Thank Rao.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.943
Thank Supergirl.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.451
[indistinct chatter]

15:58.258 --> 16:01.028
I've never seen an arsonist
so excited to get caught.

16:01.061 --> 16:04.164
That's because it was
a religious experience for him.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.966
He set the fire
to join a cult that...

16:08.201 --> 16:09.669
Worships me.

16:11.371 --> 16:15.608
The man who leads it,
this guy named Coville
thinks that

16:15.642 --> 16:17.744
being saved by Supergirl
anoints you.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.113
So he set the fire,
so I would save him.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.214
What if you weren't here?

16:21.248 --> 16:23.650
Coville is telling people
to put themselves at risk.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.152
He needs to be arrested.

16:25.185 --> 16:29.489
Unless Coville specifically
told that kid to harm himself
and others,

16:29.522 --> 16:32.192
he's protected.
It's freedom of speech.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.062
But he holds sway over
these people as their pastor.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.697
People can worship
whatever they want.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.232
It's called
freedom of religion.

16:41.834 --> 16:46.073
There's gotta be something
you can do before
this escalates.

16:46.106 --> 16:50.310
Until Coville breaks the law,
my hands are tied. I'm sorry.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.153
Okay, I just finished
my homework. Can we practice
my song now?

17:00.187 --> 17:03.623
What about your extra credit
project for French?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.957
[speaking in broken French]

17:04.991 --> 17:09.162
Okay, I'm assuming that means
you're done with that as well.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.165
I'm sorry, babe.
I have this pile of work to do.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.700
Can you start
your research paper?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.102
But you said
we'd practice my song.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.170
-I know.
-[Jeremy] Excuse me. Ms. Arias.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.372
I just got a call from JQB,

17:19.406 --> 17:22.109
-there's a problem
with the merger.
-What kind of problem?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.111
Morgan Edge just lodged
an anti-trust complaint

17:24.144 --> 17:27.214
-with the Federal
Trade Commission.
-He did what?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.515
Mom?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.118
I'm sorry, babe.
I have to deal with this.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.286
-Mom.
-Ruby this is really important.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.855
Okay, we start by getting
the Commissioner on the phone,

17:35.888 --> 17:38.458
so get me a number. I am not
letting this merger fall apart.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.792
[door closes]

17:46.233 --> 17:47.300
Can I help you?

17:47.334 --> 17:49.802
Hi, my name is Kara Danvers.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.273
Oh, yes, I remember you
from last night.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.275
Yes. [chuckles]

17:55.308 --> 17:57.377
I'm a reporter
at CatCo Magazine.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.846
CatCo... I love that Cat Grant.

17:59.879 --> 18:00.880
Yeah.

18:00.913 --> 18:06.186
I'm actually researching
an article about your...

18:06.219 --> 18:08.821
...religion.
Do you mind if I ask
a few questions?

18:08.855 --> 18:12.192
Oh. Always happy to talk about
what we're up to.

18:12.225 --> 18:16.296
So, one of your followers,
he was in a fire last night.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.632
-He almost died.
-I heard...

18:19.666 --> 18:22.702
He wanted to test his faith.
And he was rewarded.

18:22.735 --> 18:26.406
-Supergirl saved him.
-He burned the building down.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.277
-Other people
could've gotten hurt--
-But they didn't.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.245
As was Rao's way.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.248
[scoffs]

18:36.249 --> 18:38.251
I...

18:38.285 --> 18:41.754
I think it's admirable that
you want to help people.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.258
I mean, logically,
Supergirl can't save everyone.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.859
There's only one of her.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.330
Is this a test?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.599
Excuse me?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.402
Did you come here
to test my faith?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.905
Supergirl?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.474
I'm not.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.742
[stammers]

19:04.544 --> 19:07.146
I looked into your eyes

19:07.980 --> 19:10.183
from my seat on that plane.

19:11.318 --> 19:15.388
When you look into
the eyes of God,
you do not forget.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.897
Wait, don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.300
As Rao says,

19:27.334 --> 19:30.903
"Let my God walk amongst you
and shelter Her"

19:30.937 --> 19:33.373
I am not God. Rao is.

19:33.406 --> 19:37.377
Rao says even his Gods
can lose their way.

19:37.410 --> 19:41.180
If you're lost, I can help you.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.858
Where did you get that?

19:51.891 --> 19:54.927
I found every artifact
of Krypton there was
to find.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.332
This contains Rao's words.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.868
This can remind you
of what Rao says.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.203
I know what Rao says.
You are perverting it.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.343
You're going to stop
having these meetings.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.980
You're going to stop telling
people to put themselves
in danger.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.818
If I am a God,
you need to do as I say.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.821
You need to trust me.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.491
I trust you.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.952
In her name I swear.
I will serve her.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.422
I will save her.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.368
[door opens]

21:08.401 --> 21:12.739
Baby? I'm finally,
finally done.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.379
[sighs]

21:29.556 --> 21:31.023
Love that couch.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.360
So many stress naps
happened there.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.462
The update.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.899
Morgan Edge tried to get
the FTC to quash the merger.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.036
But I got the complaint
dismissed.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.507
The merger is finally done.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.541
Congratulations.

21:48.575 --> 21:51.378
You saved the deal
and a lot of jobs this week.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.845
Really good work, Sam.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.384
-Sam.
-I'm sorry.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.986
Oh... [sighs]

22:00.019 --> 22:01.521
This is so unprofessional.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.090
[sighs]

22:04.123 --> 22:06.959
-What's the matter?
-I'm just screwing up.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.461
Not with work.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.497
With Ruby.

22:11.598 --> 22:14.601
All she wanted to do
was practice her song with me.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.670
And I kept saying,
"No, later, later," and...

22:18.037 --> 22:19.171
[sighs]

22:19.205 --> 22:21.408
I mean, look at her,
I just feel like
the worst mother.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.478
Why are you smiling?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.814
Because I actually had
the worst mother,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.882
objectively speaking.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.852
So I find your self appraisal
a little funny.

22:32.885 --> 22:36.689
I let my kid fall asleep
on my couch in the office.
It's not great.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.758
She fell asleep
watching her mom work hard.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.359
She may not understand
the ins and outs,

22:40.393 --> 22:42.995
but she knows what's important
and you're the only one
who can fix it.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.499
That's how you raise a girl
to be a badass.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.404
Yeah. She already is a bad-ass.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.506
Yeah, 'cause she's loved.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.542
And she knows it.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.755
Hey, you okay?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.427
Our religion
was so important on Krypton.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.697
Not just spiritually,

23:18.965 --> 23:21.534
but it was our community.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.470
Yeah, that's how I felt
every Sunday at my church.

23:23.503 --> 23:27.474
I didn't realize how much
I missed it until I heard
those prayers again.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.743
But Coville's teachings
are so misguided.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.783
I tried to tell him,
but he only hears
what he wants to hear.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.053
I mean, how do I tell him

23:42.589 --> 23:46.593
that my sister was
on a crashing plane
and he just got lucky.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.497
[James] Mmm.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.565
He knows I'm Supergirl.

23:54.567 --> 23:58.471
Whoa. How? Wait, what?
That's not good.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.607
I can fight so many things

24:00.640 --> 24:03.643
but I don't know
how to fight someone's belief.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.111
He's blinded by faith.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.515
[James sighs]

24:08.548 --> 24:12.652
Let me ask you,
what makes somebody blind
just because they believe?

24:12.685 --> 24:15.522
-You know how I met Superman?
-At the Daily Planet.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.624
No, that's your cousin, Clark.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.593
[sighs]

24:20.627 --> 24:23.062
So one day
I climbed up this bridge spire

24:24.597 --> 24:26.699
to get this angle
on this tanker fire.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.536
It was beautiful. It was great.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.538
There was a lot
of smoke in the air.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.641
I got light-headed.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.110
And I lost my footing.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.615
And I fell.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.652
And I knew for sure
that I was going to die.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.755
So I just prayed.
I prayed o anything,

24:48.788 --> 24:50.957
to anyone who was listening...

24:52.291 --> 24:53.660
To save me.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.130
And then out of this smoke
came this hand,
and grasped mine.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.536
And that was the first time
Superman saved me.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.672
Same way you did Coville.

25:05.705 --> 25:10.743
My biology absorbs
solar radiation at
a different rate than humans.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.712
What about that is miraculous?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.081
In this life,
prayer normally doesn't work.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.884
Nobody shows up. But Clark did.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.920
And you do.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.991
Kara, you're something
that we can see,
something that we can touch.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.160
How are you not a miracle?

25:32.699 --> 25:35.868
And at least you got
a part of your culture back,
I mean, that's...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.672
That's something.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.340
Greetings, new friends.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.210
If you're watching me,
you've received
a collection of works

25:44.243 --> 25:47.546
-and history from Krypton.
-I think I need to get back
to the DEO.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.816
Open these...

25:53.920 --> 25:54.954
-Winn.
-Mmm.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.757
I need you to run a scan
on a BetaHedron signature.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.158
What's that? A Beta-what?

25:59.191 --> 26:02.228
It's like the Omegahedron
that powered Fort Rozz,
only smaller.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.362
Oh, that makes sense.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.997
So, on Krypton, we used
BetaHedrons to power probes

26:05.031 --> 26:09.736
that scientists would send out
into space that can contain
Kryptonian artifacts

26:09.769 --> 26:11.203
like this one,
embedded with information

26:11.237 --> 26:15.942
like our history, religion,
so other worlds
would learn our culture.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.778
Oh, yeah. On Earth,
we had that too.
The Voyager probe.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.947
Well, the Kryptonian probe
must've landed on Earth

26:20.980 --> 26:23.249
and this obelisk was in it.
And Coville had it.

26:23.282 --> 26:27.119
Okay. So, you're saying
that Coville has
an unlimited power supply,

26:27.153 --> 26:29.789
with absolutely no idea
what it's capable of?

26:29.822 --> 26:30.857
-Yeah.
-Right. Okay.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.692
Oh, hey! I found it.
Look at that.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.862
Whoa, guys, this is bad.
It's degrading.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.197
If someone doesn't
stabilize that,
that's gonna breach.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.133
That's gonna be enough
to take out
an entire city block.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.336
He knows what it's capable of.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.740
He was willing to burn down
a building for one recruit.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.743
Imagine how many recruits
he'd get with a bomb.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.045
I'm going to
the Community Center
to find him.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.147
Kara?

26:55.181 --> 26:57.950
-The BetaHedron's not there.
-Then where is it?

26:59.185 --> 27:01.788
-[all cheering]
-[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

27:11.330 --> 27:16.836
Today we repay the salvation
that She has granted us

27:16.869 --> 27:21.808
by bringing these people
into the baptism of light.

27:22.775 --> 27:27.814
Today we reaffirm
to Her and to all,

27:27.847 --> 27:33.119
that She is the God
of our Earth.

27:41.127 --> 27:44.263
[Supergirl on radio]
I'm almost to the stadium.
You're sure that's where it is?

27:44.296 --> 27:45.732
Yes. And I checked attendance.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.466
The stadium
is at full capacity.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.667
That is 15,000 people.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.838
Alex, you have 10 minutes
before the BetaHedron breaches.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.673
You need to get everybody
out of that stadium right now.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.347
[Supergirl] Coville.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.249
Our prayers have been answered.

28:05.251 --> 28:09.055
Whatever you did to
the BetaHedron, to the probe...

28:09.088 --> 28:10.757
You have to stop it now!

28:10.790 --> 28:11.958
Don't you see the beauty?

28:11.991 --> 28:15.762
The same vessel
that delivered
Rao's word to Earth

28:15.795 --> 28:19.431
has now become
an instrument for destruction.

28:19.465 --> 28:24.871
To give you the chance
to deliver thousands
to our ranks?

28:24.904 --> 28:28.107
A test to reaffirm to yourself

28:28.140 --> 28:30.042
what Rao sees in you.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.244
But Rao is peaceful.

28:32.278 --> 28:36.749
Rao would never ask
his followers to endanger
other people.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.051
What you're doing
is an insult to Him.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.021
What we're doing
is in service of Him.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.958
And in service of you.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.729
[scoffs]

28:50.763 --> 28:53.432
Winn, you're going to have to
tell me how to shut it down--

28:53.465 --> 28:55.234
[grunting]

28:55.267 --> 28:56.335
[gasps]

28:58.337 --> 29:00.172
What's wrong with her?

29:00.206 --> 29:03.810
Don't worry,
this is all part of Rao's plan.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.011
[breathing heavily]

29:05.044 --> 29:06.779
Winn. Winn!

29:06.813 --> 29:08.214
Supergirl, what's happening?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.816
It's...

29:12.051 --> 29:13.452
Kryptonite.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.787
Kryptonite.

29:14.821 --> 29:17.890
-Alex, something went wrong.
-[Alex on radio] Yeah, I heard.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.425
We need to stop this game.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.227
We got a packed house,
Agent Danvers.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.931
You yell "bomb" out here,
people are going
to get trampled.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.332
[all cheering]

29:27.466 --> 29:29.535
You're gonna have
to shut that thing down.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.437
We won't get everybody
out in time.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.073
Repeat, we will not evacuate
in time.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.843
We are all going to die.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.077
You need to shut it down.

29:38.110 --> 29:42.048
You said she would save us.
That she would save everybody.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.349
And she will.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.922
Those people up there,

29:49.956 --> 29:51.223
they need to be awoken.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.394
Only you can do that.

29:55.427 --> 30:00.132
You are the one
to deliver Rao's light
upon all of us.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.200
[panting]

30:01.233 --> 30:02.869
Don't you see?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.071
[grunts]

30:05.104 --> 30:06.973
I am no God.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.075
No.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.176
No.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.880
[people clamoring]

30:14.914 --> 30:16.282
[Coville] Wait, stop.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.055
I believed in you.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.891
Please.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.938
That was supposed
to turn it off.
It's not turning off.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.007
Winn!

30:43.542 --> 30:44.710
It's starting to discharge.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.313
-I'm heading there.
-No. You won't make it in time.

30:47.346 --> 30:51.050
Hey! Get away from the probe
and down on the ground!

30:51.083 --> 30:53.152
-I'm just trying to help.
-Now!

30:55.021 --> 30:56.188
Supergirl.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.390
Inside, inside...

31:11.137 --> 31:14.006
They put Kryptonian
soil samples on the probe.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.942
It's laced with kryptonite.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.944
[Hank Henshaw]
Get it away from her!

31:19.378 --> 31:22.949
Alex. Supergirl.
The BetaHedron
is about to breach.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.117
You have to
fly that thing out of here.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.120
I can't. I can't.

31:28.154 --> 31:31.190
Alex, you and Supergirl
need to get out of there
right now!

31:32.191 --> 31:35.127
Get away from me.
Quick, get away.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.930
[groaning]

31:58.317 --> 31:59.952
Now! Now!

31:59.986 --> 32:03.089
Push it in. Push it in.

32:09.161 --> 32:09.962
Alex!

32:14.033 --> 32:16.368
Get over here. Come here!

32:17.469 --> 32:18.537
[grunts]

32:18.570 --> 32:19.972
Help me push.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.009
[straining]

32:59.211 --> 33:00.712
[Kara] Are they
treating you well?

33:00.746 --> 33:03.082
Oh, yes, thank you.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.055
I have to ask...

33:11.723 --> 33:13.992
Are you going to tell
anybody who I am?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.394
Hmm.

33:16.562 --> 33:21.133
I know you gave me a name
at the rec center.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.269
But honestly,
I can't even remember it.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.705
That's not who you are.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.475
You don't know who I am at all.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.244
Oh, I know that even Gods
can lose their way.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.116
When I looked into your eyes
that night on the plane,

33:37.149 --> 33:40.552
you were clear and free.

33:40.586 --> 33:45.424
But now, your eyes are clouded
with doubt and loss.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.159
You're at a crossroads.

33:47.193 --> 33:51.297
And I finally understand
Rao's will for me.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.765
To help you on your journey.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.136
To bring you back
to clarity of purpose.

33:57.169 --> 34:00.406
Back to balance. Back to peace.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.774
This isn't my prison.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.677
This is my salvation.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.550
And so I will continue
to pray to you...

34:12.618 --> 34:17.289
But I will also pray for you.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.306
[upbeat music playing]

34:41.213 --> 34:42.214
[Sam] You guys came!

34:42.248 --> 34:44.383
Yeah, we said we would!

34:44.416 --> 34:46.252
Ruby's got a lot of cool aunts.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.155
-I know.
-Look at that.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.358
They're not worshiping you.
They're inspired by you.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.267
[all cheering and applauding]

35:05.704 --> 35:10.142
And now, please welcome

of pure imagination *

35:31.463 --> 35:38.404
* Take a look
And you'll see *

35:38.437 --> 35:44.410
* Into your imagination

35:46.312 --> 35:52.784
* There is no
Life I know *

35:52.818 --> 35:59.625
* To compare with
your imagination *

35:59.658 --> 36:06.632
* Living there
You'll be free *

36:06.665 --> 36:13.372
* If you truly wish

* To be

36:39.365 --> 36:40.466
[Kara] Alex.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.271
Alex, what's wrong? What is it?

36:46.638 --> 36:47.739
Um...

36:50.276 --> 36:52.344
Maggie doesn't want
to have kids.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.646
I thought that was something
you guys decided together.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.548
No, it... [sighs]

36:56.582 --> 37:00.419
I agreed because
it's what she wanted.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.922
Okay. Uh... Okay,
you guys will figure it out.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.993
Maggie's not gonna
change her mind.

37:08.026 --> 37:12.464
The only way that
we're gonna work through it
is if I let it go.

37:14.866 --> 37:18.003
And I've tried, Kara. I...

37:19.471 --> 37:22.408
I love her so much
that it hurts,

37:23.542 --> 37:26.978
and I convinced myself
that living a life with her,

37:27.012 --> 37:28.380
it was enough.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.617
But watching Ruby...

37:36.488 --> 37:40.826
I want all the experiences
that Mom had with us.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.562
You know,
I want to take my kid camping

37:43.595 --> 37:47.466
and I wanna show her
the constellations.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.368
I want to teach her
how to read,

37:50.068 --> 37:51.603
how to throw a punch,

37:52.738 --> 37:55.006
and how to make
cheesy valentines.

37:56.508 --> 38:01.347
And I want to hold her
when she has a bad dream,

38:01.380 --> 38:06.618
and I wanna tell her that
the world's a better place
because she's in it.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.487
Yeah.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.391
I want all of it.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.528
[sobbing] I want to be a mom.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.664
What am I going to do?

[continues sobbing]

38:28.374 --> 38:30.041
["Hallelujah" playing]

38:32.644 --> 38:35.046
Though we go forth alone,

38:35.080 --> 38:38.684
our soul unites us
under Rao's gladsome rays.

38:38.717 --> 38:42.020
We're never lost, never afraid

38:44.089 --> 38:47.593
for we shrink not under
the Sun of Righteousness.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.472
Rao binds us to those we love.

39:15.621 --> 39:18.490
He gives us strength
when we have none.

39:24.996 --> 39:28.767
And in the darkest places,
he guides us.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.004
For Rao sees all, feels all.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.973
His love eternal.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.479
[both] Rao, protect us,
so that we might
protect others.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.515
And we shall rise,

39:43.549 --> 39:47.786
a fire in His heart,
burning and free.
