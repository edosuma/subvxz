Mom’s volunteering
to spend time with the kids.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.736

a good time with them.

You know, you really
should talk to her, Ope.

to stay around until she sees you.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.206
Yeah. Maybe.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.293
Yeah. She can take the kids.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.302
That means we’ll have the house
to ourselves for a while.
