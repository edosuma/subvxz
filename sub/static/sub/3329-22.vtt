WEBVTT

00:12.080 --> 00:13.707
(sighs)

00:14.540 --> 00:16.246
Sherlock?
HOLMES:
Yeah?

00:16.280 --> 00:18.271
Can you come down
here, please?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.519
Is that the real Stanley Cup?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.209
That's precisely what
I'm trying to determine.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.483
Several days ago,

00:30.530 --> 00:32.327
whilst browsing
auction sites on the dark Web,

00:32.360 --> 00:35.158
I came across a listing for the
Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup,

00:35.200 --> 00:37.168
aka Lorcl Stanley's Cup.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.067
I was skeptical as to the Cup's
provenance, so I bought it.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.829
Why would you buy it if
you were skeptical...?

00:43.310 --> 00:44.800
It started off
as a mere bowl.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.603
In 1927, long narrow bands
were added

00:46.640 --> 00:49.200
and then replaced
by uneven bands in 1947.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.104
The original bowl
is in the vault

00:51.150 --> 00:53.118
in the Hockey Hall of Fame
in Toronto.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.118
The Hall also keeps a
near-perfect duplicate on hand.

00:55.150 --> 00:57.789
"The Presentation Cup,"
if indeed this is

00:57.820 --> 00:59.788
the genuine article,
is here.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.856
Wait a second, are
you into hockey?

01:01.890 --> 01:03.255
What I'm "into," Watson,
is the possibility

01:03.290 --> 01:05.087
that the Cup
was stolen.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.098
It travels_ under the constant
superVISIon of Its keeper,

01:07.130 --> 01:09.360
so opportunities to nick it
are very, very rare.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.220
If it is
the real Cup,

01:11.270 --> 01:12.862
I shall return it
to the National Hockey League

01:12.900 --> 01:14.265
with all due haste.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.234
If not, Clyde has
a new wading pool.

01:16.270 --> 01:19.273
And the reason
it's in the tub is?

01:19.310 --> 01:21.278
I was measuring
water displacement

01:21.310 --> 01:22.800
to determine
the Cup's density.

01:22.850 --> 01:23.805
Now it's just drying.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.340
Mmm.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.412
It can dry elsewhere.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.613
Nice, yo.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.252
Getting closer to
that 80-inch plasma.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.258
Man, plasma dead, bro--
you want LED.

01:37.290 --> 01:38.689
Ooh, check it out.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.490
Hey, yo, man, you having
trouble getting home?

01:45.530 --> 01:46.792
Man, he look
lost to me.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.239
Tell you what.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.329
Show us your wallet,
we see where you live,

01:50.370 --> 01:52.179
make sure you get
on the right train.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.177
Hey, man,
I'm talking to you.

01:53.210 --> 01:55.405
Oh, no way.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.203
Hey. Hey, mister,
can you hear me?

01:57.250 --> 01:58.899
Yo, what are you doing?
We got to get out of here.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.440
We can't just leave him here.
He'll die.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.289
So?

02:04.550 --> 02:06.859
Hey, mister-- everything's
all right, mister.

02:06.890 --> 02:08.551
The ambulance is coming.
They're gonna help you.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.228
Yeah, I want
to report a...

02:10.260 --> 02:12.228
I don't know,
an assault or something.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.694
You hated it.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.492
Well, I wouldn't
say "hated."

02:54.540 --> 02:56.508
I just never understood bands
that are that angry.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.235
They are not angry.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.737
They're young.
You're old.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.409
You act like I don't know
you got a few months on me.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.419
If you are trying to talk me
out of going back to my place,

03:06.450 --> 03:07.815
boy, you are doing
a good job.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.715
Your place?

03:09.750 --> 03:11.342
That's new.

03:11.390 --> 03:12.789
It's my neighborhood,

03:12.820 --> 03:15.880
and, um, got rid
of all those bodies, so...

03:15.920 --> 03:17.785
(chuckles)

03:17.830 --> 03:19.821
(cell phone rings)

03:22.370 --> 03:24.361
It's work.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.791
Seana Scott.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.838
I'll be right there.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.678
Sorry.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.270
I-I'll call you
if it's not too late.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.617
Sure.

03:40.650 --> 03:41.776
Tomorrow works, too.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.481
Don't give up on tonight.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.551
(cell phone rings)

03:57.570 --> 04:00.334
It's Bell.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.435
Watson, you've lived here
your whole life.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.779
Why do you think so many
New Yorkers feel the need

04:06.810 --> 04:08.778
to combine public transportation
with public urination?

04:08.810 --> 04:10.539
You know, it's
part of the charm.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.377
What I've been told so far--

04:12.420 --> 04:16.288
victim's a New Jersey criminal
court judge named Dennis Vaughn.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.709
Looks like someone got him
at the top of the steps.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.718
Single stab wound to the chest.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.011
Weapon was a screwdriver.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.722
12th Squad caught the case,

04:24.760 --> 04:26.318
but given
who the vic is,

04:26.360 --> 04:29.022
Chief of D's asked Major Case
to take it over.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.664
Detective Bell.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.759
Detective Scott from the 12th,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.028
this is Sherlock
Holmes, Joan Watson.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.402
Any idea why the judge
was in the city?

04:36.440 --> 04:38.829
Spoke to a clerk
at his office.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.838
She said he was here
attending a fund-raiser

04:40.880 --> 04:42.939
for the Jersey governor's
reelection campaign.

04:42.980 --> 04:46.040
So the governor of New Jersey
holds fund-raisers in New York?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.672
Have you ever
been to Trenton?

04:48.980 --> 04:50.811
CSU lifted these prints
off of the weapon.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.818
May I?

04:52.860 --> 04:55.010
BELL: Who called it in?
SCOTT: Couple of kids
over there.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.482
They don't exactly
scream "model citizens,"

04:56.530 --> 04:57.781
but they stuck around,

04:57.830 --> 04:59.491
so I'm thinking they
weren't involved.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.725
We'll know more when
the prints come back.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.967
Prints are more likely yours
than theirs, Detective.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.922
Excuse me?

05:05.970 --> 05:07.597
I don't mean yours,
specifically,

05:07.640 --> 05:09.904
but I'm fairly certain
these prints are female.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.477
Research has shown
a direct correlation

05:12.510 --> 05:14.705
between the relative thickness
of the ridges and valleys

05:14.740 --> 05:16.708
of an individual's fingerprints
and his or her sex.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.469
And you can see these ridges
and valleys well enough

05:19.520 --> 05:20.919
to know the difference?

05:20.950 --> 05:22.918
Oh, trust me, he can.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.747
Was the judge married?

05:24.790 --> 05:26.041
SCOTT:
No. I asked the clerk.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.354
Next of kin is a
brother in Florida.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.857
Well, he had sex tonight.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.758
Not the brother; the judge.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.756
He's freshly showered,
and his skin bears the aroma

05:34.800 --> 05:37.769
of a soap used exclusively
at the Waldorf-Astoria.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.062
That's where the
fund-raiser was.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.897
And yet he didn't spend
the night.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.931
His presence here suggests
he was on his way home.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.734
Before he got very far,
he met with a passionate death

05:45.770 --> 05:47.499
at the hands of a woman.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.747
So you're thinking
lovers' quarrel.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.146
Wouldn't explain the use of a
screwdriver as a murder weapon,

05:52.180 --> 05:53.977
but it would accommodate
the other evidence.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.976
I'll get the guest list
from the fund-raiser,

05:56.020 --> 05:58.545
see if anyone ﬁts the bill.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.381
WOMAN:
You think I had something to do

06:02.430 --> 06:04.079
with what happened
to Judge Vaughn.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.984
GREGSON: We know the judge left
the fund-raiser early

06:06.030 --> 06:07.054
and went up

06:07.100 --> 06:09.091
to a room at the Waldorf.

06:09.130 --> 06:12.099
We also know that
you had a room there.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.598
That's where you spent
last night.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.608
The governor's
office booked rooms

06:16.640 --> 06:18.608
for all of his
top staffers.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.733
None of us were gonna drive
back t-to Trenton last night.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.577
That's fair enough.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.407
But you were the only one
of those staffers

06:24.450 --> 06:26.042
who was seen leaving
the function

06:26.080 --> 06:27.877
around the same time
that Judge Vaughn did.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.649
Neither of you returned
for the rest of the evening.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.749
We know what happened
to him, Miss Nichols.

06:31.790 --> 06:32.984
Where were you?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.786
Dennis and I had been
seeing each other

06:38.830 --> 06:40.957
on and off since
law school.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.924
He had to be, what, uh,
20 years older than you?

06:46.970 --> 06:48.961
He was a professor.
You were a student.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.837
Uh, at first, it had
to be a secret,

06:53.880 --> 06:57.077
and then, over the
years, he just insisted

06:57.110 --> 06:59.078
we keep it that way.

06:59.110 --> 07:01.146
He was worried about what it
would do to his reputation.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.514
I didn't say
anything because,

07:04.550 --> 07:05.812
even now, I don't think

07:05.850 --> 07:07.579
that he would want
anybody to know.

07:07.620 --> 07:10.851
And after he left the hotel,
you didn't go back to the party.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.688
No, I was invited

07:13.730 --> 07:15.698
by a friend for a drink

07:15.730 --> 07:17.527
at a bar around the corner.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.937
And we were there until
I heard about Dennis.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.029
Her name's Andrea Schuster.
I can gIve you her number.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.662
(door opens)

07:24.710 --> 07:26.701
Can I talk to you
guys a second?

07:28.810 --> 07:30.778
I wouldn't bother getting
Miss Nichols' prints.

07:30.810 --> 07:33.779
NCIC just came back
with a hit in Jersey.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.913
Woman by the name
of Nikki Moreno.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.508
Repeat drug offender.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.518
Judge Vaughn sentenced
her to four years

07:39.560 --> 07:41.619
at Pemberton Women's
Correctional Facility.

07:41.660 --> 07:42.922
When was she
released?

07:42.960 --> 07:43.858
She wasn't.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.927
She escaped two days ago.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.527
There's Moreno's
VISItor logs,

07:50.570 --> 07:53.164
phone transcripts
and all the write-ups.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.964
State police got
copies, too.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.536
She was a troublemaker.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.538
Pulled a few
cell phones off her.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.935
She'd mouth off
to the C.O.'s.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.902
Couple times, I had
to put her in the SHU.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.919
Oh, that's...
that's solitary.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.508
We get Netflix.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.882
Any idea how
she got out?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.889
First_ we noticed was when
she didn't show up for count.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.855
We went into lockdown,
but she was gone.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.859
We still got a lot
of video to go through.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.697
I'd like copies
of those videos.

08:21.730 --> 08:22.924
I'd also like to
walk your perimeter

08:22.970 --> 08:24.961
and examine each
of your gates.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.797
Oh, uh, our people
went over all of that.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.637
They didn't find
anything.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.638
Well, knowing how she escaped
might help us find out

08:30.670 --> 08:33.104
if anyone was helping her,
maybe even tell us where she is.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.937
My interest is equally academic.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.973
True prison breaks, those from
within the grounds, are rare.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.149
Those perpetrated by women,
almost unheard of.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.019
It's statistics, Watson.

08:44.050 --> 08:45.847
It's not that they fail more.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.255
It's just that they don't try.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.919
Academic interests
asnde, we would

08:50.960 --> 08:52.086
appreciate your help.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.654
Tell you the truth,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.224
this whole thing
doesn't surprise me.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.659
Budget cuts have

08:56.700 --> 08:58.099
stretched us pretty thin.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.324
We're understaffed.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.099
A lot of the cameras
are on the fritz.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.608
Guys at R.E. only care
about the bottom line.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.834
R.E.?

09:04.870 --> 09:06.235
Reform Enterprises.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.874
It's the company that
owns this facility.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.172
Privatized prisons,

09:09.210 --> 09:10.700
capitalism at its most cynical.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.342
Profits are tied
to filling the beds,

09:12.380 --> 09:15.019
so public policy that puts more
people behind bars is good,

09:15.050 --> 09:18.087
and prevention
and rehabilitation are bad.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.213
I stay out of
all the politics.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.581
We're just trying
to do our jobs.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.222
While Mr. Holmes checks
out the grounds,

09:24.260 --> 09:26.251
we'd like to see
MISS Moreno's cell.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.623
WATSON: Nikki only had two years
left on her sentence.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.069
Now, if we find her,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.897
she's gonna spend the rest
of her life behind bars.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.737
From her file,
it looks like

09:34.770 --> 09:36.362
Judge Vaughn could have
gone a lot easier on her.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.005
Deputy Warden McCann made
her sound like a hothead.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.928
Maybe she held a grudge.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.641
Already been tossed?

09:59.230 --> 10:02.119
Detective Scott seems nice.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.197
Matching hand stamps
at the crime scene.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.663
Dead giveaway.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.304
We've been trying
to keep it low-profile.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.001
_ At least until
It gets more serious.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.031
Well, she seems nice.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.998
I mean it.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.006
Yeah, thanks.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.245
I've never dated another
detective before.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.248
It has its pros and cons.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.985
We understand each other.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.281
The Poetry of Robert Frost.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.820
Looks pretty new.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.122
This is the only book

10:34.160 --> 10:36.993
that isn't from
the prison library.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.998
Does Nikki strike you

10:39.030 --> 10:41.999
as the "poems about
New England farm life" type?

10:42.040 --> 10:45.237
Could be she was expanding
her horizons.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.079
Could be it was a gift.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.141
"Start with page ten
and dream about the apple trees.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.204
Jeff."

10:58.150 --> 10:59.879
It's pretty intimate stuff.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.979
Yeah, I don't remember
anyone named Jeff

11:02.020 --> 11:04.022
in Nikki's visitor log.

11:04.060 --> 11:07.052
Weren't any Jeffs in her list
of known associates, either.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.989
So whoever he is,
maybe he knows something.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.036
So I think I know
who Jeff is.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.038
Do tell.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.129
I just heard back from
the warden at Pemberton.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.148
Turns out there's an attorney
named Jeff Harper

11:23.180 --> 11:24.977
who gives seminars
at the prison.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.808
That's why his name wasn't
on Nikki's visitor list.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.989
He works for an advocacy group
that advises inmates

11:30.020 --> 11:32.215
of their rights, answers
any legal questions.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.411
And gifts them with the
occasional book of poetry?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.416
The warden agreed
that was unusual.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.428
So I thought we'd pay Jeff
a visit tomorrow,

11:38.460 --> 11:40.428
see if there was anything more
to his relationship

11:40.460 --> 11:42.018
with Nikki than people knew.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.039
Now what are you doing?
My previous test

11:48.070 --> 11:51.039
of the Cup's legitimacy
proved inconclusive.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.800
As you are no doubt aware,
the metal composition

11:53.840 --> 11:56.400
of cutlery can have an
effect on food's flavor.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.078
That's why caviar is
best enjoyed with spoons

11:58.110 --> 11:59.941
made of bone or porcelain
rather than steel.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.016
This is a far cry from
a spoon, of course,

12:02.050 --> 12:03.813
but the same essential
prInCIples apply.

12:03.850 --> 12:06.216
So you think you'll be able to
taste if that's the real trophy.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.048
Mmm, needs a moment.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.229
Oh, is that everything
from the 12th?

12:11.260 --> 12:13.228
Mm-hmm. Courtesy of
Detective Scott.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.818
Unfortunately, there's
little more to glean here

12:14.860 --> 12:16.725
than there was at the
scene of the crime.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.938
So what do you
think of her?

12:19.970 --> 12:21.369
Her report is meticulous.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.459
She's a keen observer
and detail-oriented.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.034
No, I mean
do you like her?

12:25.070 --> 12:26.469
Why on earth would
that matter?

12:26.510 --> 12:28.068
Mmm, no reason.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.078
Forget I asked.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.839
You've divined her secret.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.541
What?

12:33.580 --> 12:36.242
Somehow you've realized that
she's leading a double life.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.248
You're wondering if I
was aware-- well, I was.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.848
Of course you were.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.881
She'll need to be more
careful in the future,

12:41.920 --> 12:44.081
lest everyone realize she's
working for Internal Affairs.

12:48.330 --> 12:51.128
Scott isn't Internal Affairs.
She's a detective at the 12th.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.364
She's both.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.799
I thought you said
you knew her secret.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.239
How could she be both?

12:55.270 --> 12:56.430
She's a field associate.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.869
Her desk is at
the 12th precinct,

12:57.910 --> 12:59.434
and she reports
to IAB when needed.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.869
Are you saying
she's a spy?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.275
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

13:02.310 --> 13:03.504
How do you know?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.438
After our administrative
hearing last year,

13:05.480 --> 13:07.516
I anticipated the bureau
would want to keep tabs on us.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.347
So I thought I'd beat them
to the punch.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.348
I performed some light
surveillance of their offices,

13:11.390 --> 13:13.312
and I identified a goodly number
of their field associates.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.282
Detective Scott was
one of them.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.481
This vexes you?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.122
She and Marcus have
been seeing each other.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.525
That's what I
thought you meant

13:20.560 --> 13:23.222
when you said she was
leading a double life.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.488
Oh. Well, I confess

13:25.530 --> 13:27.293
to being surprised
that that escaped my attention,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.331
but, uh, as you know, the lives
of those closest to me

13:29.370 --> 13:31.235
are often the most
difficult ones for me to...

13:31.270 --> 13:33.204
How can you be so
casual about this?

13:33.240 --> 13:35.208
About what?

13:35.240 --> 13:37.344
You don't think
he knows?
Do you?

13:38.380 --> 13:39.540
Well, say he doesn't.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.241
How is it any
of our concern?

13:41.280 --> 13:42.542
Are you serious?

13:42.580 --> 13:43.979
We're not cops, Watson.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.180
For as long as
there's been police,

13:45.220 --> 13:46.380
there's been
police corruption.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.411
The bureau might not be popular,
but it's utterly necessary.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.609
You just said you
surveilled them.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.218
Because I feared that
they might not approve

13:51.260 --> 13:52.454
of our methods,
not because I thought

13:52.490 --> 13:53.991
they were inherently evil.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.395
I know they go
after bad cops,

13:55.430 --> 13:57.421
but you know they jam
up a lot of good ones.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.926
Do you fear this to be
the case with Marcus,

13:58.970 --> 14:00.096
that he's being jammed?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.437
If you're asking
me if I think

14:01.470 --> 14:02.630
she's a honey trap--
no, I don't.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.558
I think they really like each
other, but think about it.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.305
What if he does
something small,

14:06.340 --> 14:07.534
like help fix
another cop's mistake

14:07.580 --> 14:09.400
and then tells
her about it?

14:09.440 --> 14:12.045
Isn't it her job to bring
things like this to her boss?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.169
You know, I'll call
him tomorrow,

14:15.220 --> 14:16.915
and if he knows about
it, I'll just tell him

14:16.950 --> 14:17.917
we'll keep it
between us.

14:17.950 --> 14:19.611
And if he doesn't?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.585
Then I guess he'll have
a decision to make.

14:25.530 --> 14:28.419
WOMAN (over TV):
Tonight, we'll have lows
in the mid-50$, with a slight...

14:28.460 --> 14:30.291
MAN: _
...too much _for auto insurance?
Give us a...

14:30.330 --> 14:32.366
(game show theme plays,
announcer speaks indistinctly)

14:32.400 --> 14:34.288
(cell phone chimes)

14:44.210 --> 14:46.041
(phone chimes)

14:49.480 --> 14:51.038
(phone chimes)

15:15.080 --> 15:16.536
GREGSON:
I asked the Freehold PD

15:16.580 --> 15:18.571
in Jersey to send us those.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.670
Gwen is Deputy McCann's wife.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.542
She called 911
after that last text.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.252
BELL: The way McCann
talked about Nikki Moreno,

15:28.290 --> 15:29.655
they locked horns
plenty.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.658
First Judge
Vaughn, then him?

15:31.690 --> 15:33.726
Looks like she's
keeping a hit list.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.557
For a previously
unremarkable drug dealer,

15:35.600 --> 15:37.158
Miss Moreno continues
to defy expectations.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.988
Spree killer is yet another
category dominated by men.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.008
How does she do it?

15:43.040 --> 15:46.009
Would you be happier if
women were better criminals?

15:46.040 --> 15:47.200
Anything on the weapon?

15:47.240 --> 15:49.231
Just that she used
a nine millimeter,

15:49.280 --> 15:50.645
and it hasn't
turned up yet.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.648
Assume she's still got it,
wherever she is.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.046
Federal marshals,
state police, every PD

15:55.080 --> 15:57.048
in New York
and New Jersey is into it,

15:57.090 --> 15:59.217
and no one's
got a clue.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.184
Sherlock and I are going
to meet with Jeff Harper

16:01.220 --> 16:03.188
at 9:00 at his office--
maybe you want to join us?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.458
Jeff Harper?

16:04.490 --> 16:06.082
He's the advocacy attorney

16:06.130 --> 16:08.098
who gave Nikki the
book Joan found.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.256
Seemed like a pretty
personal gift

16:09.300 --> 16:11.291
to come from a
legal adVIsor,

16:11.330 --> 16:13.491
so even if he's not helping her,
he might have some insight.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.337
Given this new
development,

16:15.370 --> 16:17.304
I suggest you visit
Mr. Harper without me.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.467
_ I would like to
inspect the scene

16:19.510 --> 16:22.308
of the deputy warden's murder
myself as well as his remains.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.149
I'll set it up.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.670
Let me know
what you guys find.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.648
BELL:
"Lovers, forget your love,

16:30.690 --> 16:32.248
"and list to the
love of these.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.485
She a window flower,
and he a winter breeze."

16:34.520 --> 16:35.680
Page ten.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.426
It's pretty stuff.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.428
That come up when you were
explaining the appeals process?

16:39.460 --> 16:41.428
Or how to prep
for a parole hearing?

16:41.460 --> 16:43.428
You must have some real
questions you want to ask me.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.619
So ask them.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.797
Did you help
Nikki Moreno escape?

16:46.830 --> 16:48.331
No.

16:48.370 --> 16:49.337
BELL: Do you know
where she is?
No.

16:49.370 --> 16:53.374
Well, you obviously got
closer than people knew.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.378
Actually, we didn't.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.207
I'll admit there
was flirtation.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.444
I liked her.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.277
And she flirted back.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.141
I assume because she saw me
as someone who could help.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.545
Maybe the poetry book
was ill-advised,

17:05.590 --> 17:08.150
but I'm not an idiot--
I never crossed the line.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.350
What kind of help
did she want?

17:09.390 --> 17:11.051
Same kind everyone
in prison wants.

17:11.090 --> 17:13.229
How to get out quicker.
Legally.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.558
Did she tell you about her plans
for Judge Vaughn or Trey McCann?

17:15.600 --> 17:18.228
I would've come
forward if she had.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.159
I'm just as shocked
as anybody-- more so.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.566
And I never heard her say
a word against Judge Vaughn.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.464
But did I know she
hated Trey McCann?

17:25.510 --> 17:28.604
Sure. You know what it's like
in those private prisons?

17:28.640 --> 17:31.541
Well, the late deputy warden had
a few thoughts on the matter.

17:31.580 --> 17:34.071
Gave you his "we're underfunded
and we're just trying

17:34.120 --> 17:35.439
to do our jobs" speech, right?

17:35.480 --> 17:38.643
That place is a breeding
ground for abusive guards.

17:38.690 --> 17:42.148
McCann would put women in the
SHU just to show his dominance.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.658
Last week, he forced Nikki
to switch work details.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.488
He assigned her
to a computer recycling shop.

17:47.530 --> 17:50.090
You know what they
do in those places?
Recycle computers?

17:50.130 --> 17:52.462
The prisoners break up
old components with hammers.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.388
They're exposed to dangerous
levels of toxic heaw metals,

17:54.440 --> 17:56.396
and they're not even given
proper protective gear.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.806
Look, I get that prison
isn't supposed to be a picnic.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.478
But you put housing inmates
in the hands

18:00.510 --> 18:02.398
of for-profit companies,
and all human decency

18:02.440 --> 18:04.169
goes out the window.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.802
You obviously have
strong feelings.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.374
Makes me wonder if you decided

18:07.420 --> 18:09.877
to help one inmate get
a little payback.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.412
I want prison reform,
not anarchy.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.452
Besides, I already was
helping Nikki get out,

18:16.490 --> 18:18.128
the right way.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.721
I'd just filed a motion to
get her sentence reduced.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.591
Took weeks of prep,

18:23.630 --> 18:27.361
pro bono, and I think
we had a decent shot at winning.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.301
Now, tell me,

18:30.340 --> 18:34.629
why would I bother to do all
that, and then help her escape?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.276
We should get the court records
to confirm all this,

18:38.310 --> 18:39.846
but my gut says
he's telling the truth.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.246
He would have wanted
to let the motion play out.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.544
Now, the courthouse
is just a couple miles away.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.387
You want to take
a ride over there?

18:46.420 --> 18:49.583
Before we do, I'd like
to talk to you about something.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.558
REPORTER:
The search continues today
for Nikki Moreno,

18:54.600 --> 18:56.693
a prisoner who escaped
from Pemberton Women's

18:56.730 --> 18:59.858
Correctional Facility
in New Jersey several days ago.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.391
I know you guys swear by
this place at the 11th,

19:02.440 --> 19:04.829
but a cop bar?
Really? For lunch?

19:04.870 --> 19:07.532
I bet the salads are even
made of ground beef.

19:09.210 --> 19:11.246
Just felt right today.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.442
What is it?

19:17.650 --> 19:19.641
Do you work for IAB?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.526
It's a simple question.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.495
No, it's not.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.851
And yes, I do.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.868
Did they force you?

19:31.900 --> 19:34.391
Jam you up
so you had to work with them?

19:34.440 --> 19:35.839
Nobody jammed me up.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.361
I was approached at the academy.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.435
So you've been
in their pocket a long time.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.708
A little over eight years.

19:41.740 --> 19:42.968
They know about us?
No.

19:43.010 --> 19:44.602
But eventually.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.504
I don't know.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.286
I'm not in anyone's
pocket, okay?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.288
I'm a resource.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.687
When I.A. needs to know
what's going on at the 12th,

19:57.730 --> 19:59.618
I shed light. That's it.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.457
More often than not,
what I tell them

20:01.500 --> 20:03.525
helps good cops
stay out of trouble.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.822
Because that's what the rat
squad's all about, right?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.428
Helping cops?

20:07.470 --> 20:09.734
Wow. Must be a nice view

20:09.770 --> 20:11.738
from that glass house, Marcus.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.374
What's that supposed to mean?

20:13.410 --> 20:15.378
It means that a little
over a year ago,

20:15.410 --> 20:18.379
you gift-wrapped your old boss
Deputy Commissioner Da Silva.

20:18.410 --> 20:19.946
He is serving life now.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.743
He was in bed with a Mob family.

20:21.780 --> 20:22.940
He was a cop.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.538
A brother in blue.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.657
Weren't you supposed to
just look the other way?

20:28.690 --> 20:31.420
What I did and what you do

20:31.460 --> 20:33.496
are totally different.

20:33.530 --> 20:34.724
How?

20:34.760 --> 20:38.321
I went to work for
Da Silva in good faith.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.621
Something stunk.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.036
I reported it because I had to.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.561
You? You're a plant.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.862
You take shots from the shadows.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.401
I do not take shots.
I answer questions.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.408
You hide what you really are.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.668
And you rat on your friends.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.644
Men and women that would
give their lives for you.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.956
(scoffs)
I could never do that.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.020
I'd like to think that you...

21:09.060 --> 21:11.528
know me by now.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.719
I mean,

21:12.770 --> 21:15.694
is that how you honestly
think I do my job?

21:15.740 --> 21:18.334
I never knew you, Seana.

21:18.370 --> 21:20.372
Not for a second.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.526
(door opens and closes)

21:37.560 --> 21:39.687
(Watson sighing)

21:41.430 --> 21:42.692
Oh, hey.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.925
I thought you'd
still be in Freehold.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.689
There's little to be found
in Freehold. I returned here.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.607
I know why you're
so obsessed.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.767
It kills you that an
unremarkable criminal

21:52.810 --> 21:55.028
could figure out
how to escape from a prison

21:55.080 --> 21:56.604
when you can't.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.904
That's nonsense.
I know how I'd escape.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.577
I found 11 different ways.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.838
What I cannot determine
is how she escaped.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.019
Surveillance footage,
log records,

22:05.050 --> 22:06.688
physical evidence...

22:06.720 --> 22:09.416
have ruled out every method
I've devised.

22:13.630 --> 22:14.858
Is this my bra?

22:14.900 --> 22:16.959
Yes, I needed the underwire.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.025
I was testing whether
Miss Moreno could have

22:19.070 --> 22:20.697
fashioned a suitable lock pick

22:20.740 --> 22:22.765
from the tools
at her disposal.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.028
I also need to replace
your toothbrush.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.628
I don't suppose
the poetry lover

22:25.670 --> 22:27.638
shed any light on the situation.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.137
On top of having an alibi
the night Nikki escaped,

22:30.180 --> 22:32.148
his story with the court
checked out.

22:32.180 --> 22:36.048
Thanks to him, she had a good
shot at reducing her sentence.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.889
Perhaps her escape
was one of opportunity.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.979
She saw an out, and she took it.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.716
Or she just decided
enough is enough.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.582
Jeff Harper made it sound like
she had reached her last straw.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.427
Explain.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.621
Well, a week before
she broke out,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.797
McCann forced her to work
around toxic materials.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.799
If that happened to me and there
was nothing I could do about it,

22:55.840 --> 22:57.660
I might start
looking for a way out.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.904
Continue explaining.

22:58.940 --> 23:01.704
It was a computer
recycling shop.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.173
Prisons make deals
With big companies

23:03.210 --> 23:05.747
who use prison labor
for next to nothing.

23:05.780 --> 23:06.940
I know this.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.618
The recycling shop
you mentioned is here.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.981
You said she had no choice
in the rea55ignment.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.988
Harper specifically said
she was forced.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.817
That's what Nikki told him.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.828
McCann made her
switch jobs. Why?

23:21.560 --> 23:25.098
According to her records,
she requested the job change.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.837
But that's only according
to Officer McCann.

23:27.870 --> 23:31.135
He's the one
who reported the move.

23:31.170 --> 23:33.536
So one of them is lying.
How does that change things?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.731
I think I know
how to find Miss Moreno.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.704
The last verifiable
sighting of Nikki Moreno

23:39.750 --> 23:42.548
was shortly before her
shift was due to begin.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.844
According to the work log,
she was the only prisoner

23:44.890 --> 23:46.846
scheduled to be
here at that time.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.108
According to her file,
she asked for overtime.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.787
She was trying
to save up some money.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.855
Well, Jeff Harper
said she hated that job,

23:52.890 --> 23:54.448
so why would
she do that?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.718
Could be it was to get a hold
of the screwdriver

23:56.760 --> 23:58.694
she used to kill
Judge Vaughn.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.460
As to this being the source
of the screwdriver,

24:01.500 --> 24:02.865
I suspect you're right.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.004
But this might be the only part
of the scenario

24:05.040 --> 24:06.701
you're imagining that is.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.833
Okay. Enlighten us.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.871
Prisoners assigned here

24:10.910 --> 24:12.741
separate hazardous material
from safe,

24:12.780 --> 24:14.714
and they put each
in their respective bins.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.775
The hazardous bins
are then sealed

24:16.820 --> 24:17.946
and picked up
for transfer

24:17.990 --> 24:19.548
to a toxic waste facility.

24:19.590 --> 24:20.887
If you wouldn't mind.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.885
What, you think she escaped
in one of these bins?

24:25.930 --> 24:27.591
No.

24:27.630 --> 24:30.497
I considered the possibility,
and then, uh,

24:30.530 --> 24:33.124
I dismissed it.

24:33.170 --> 24:36.958
There was no pickup
the night Nikki disappeared.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.231
The next one
is not for two days.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.875
Also...

24:42.910 --> 24:44.878
thanks to Judge Vaughn's murder,

24:44.910 --> 24:47.879
I was working
under the assumption that...

24:47.920 --> 24:50.718
Nikki'd actually
left the prison.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.828
Nikki didn't escape.
She was murdered right here.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.896
A day before
Judge Vaughn was killed,

25:03.930 --> 25:06.865
so she didn't
kill him or Trey McCann.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.868
Unless I'm mistaken,

25:08.900 --> 25:11.698
Trey McCann
murdered her.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.198
The garrote was stashed
under the body.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.913
The prints on the handles
were a match for Trey McCann.

25:22.950 --> 25:25.282
We believe he transferred Nikki
to the computer lab

25:25.320 --> 25:27.288
in order to facilitate
her murder.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.550
There, he could get her alone,
away from the cameras,

25:29.590 --> 25:32.127
and also have a convenient way
of disposing of her body.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.627
Two more days, and that bin

25:33.660 --> 25:35.252
would have been buried
in a landfill.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.995
Nikki would have
disappeared forever.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.669
We like McCann
for Judge Vaughn's murder, too?

25:39.700 --> 25:41.565
He was on duty at the
prison that night.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.931
WATSON:
We found out

25:42.970 --> 25:44.835
that he made
some high-end purchases

25:44.870 --> 25:46.735
a few weeks ago,
all with cash.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.772
We think someone paid him
to get Nikki's prints

25:48.810 --> 25:50.971
on that screwdriver
and then kill her.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.103
That person is behind
Judge Vaughn's murder.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.141
And presumably the murder
of Trey McCann.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.818
He was a
loose end,

25:56.850 --> 25:58.181
tied up by the myth

25:58.220 --> 25:59.619
of Nikki Moreno's escape.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.982
She was a patsy.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.022
We can't know that
for sure yet,

26:04.060 --> 26:05.925
but we looked under
every rock in her life

26:05.960 --> 26:07.655
when we thought she
was on the run.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.588
Nobody leapt out as
wanting her dead.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.188
HOLMES:
Criminal judges,
on the other hand,

26:11.230 --> 26:13.733
collect death threats
as an occupational by-product.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.192
There were too many
suspects on one side,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.094
not enough on the other.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.836
What most interests me, however,
is the killer's choice

26:19.870 --> 26:21.303
of Trey McCann
as coconspirator.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.171
McCann wasn't exactly
a contract killer,

26:23.210 --> 26:24.768
so we think whoever hired him

26:24.810 --> 26:26.846
knew him well enough
to think he would do it.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.177
BELL:
I remembered...

26:28.220 --> 26:29.847
McCann's last gig

26:29.880 --> 26:32.348
was at a max facility
in South Jersey,

26:32.390 --> 26:34.779
and it's owned by another
for-profit company.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.254
Correctional
Administration Group.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.224
They fired him after
just eight months.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.057
Could be he got chummy
with some inmates.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.091
If he did, it would explain
why they let him go.

26:43.130 --> 26:45.189
It might also reveal
a connection to a criminal

26:45.230 --> 26:48.199
or group of criminals
that wished Judge Vaughn dead.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.037
Talk to the people
who fired McCann.

26:50.070 --> 26:52.800
See if you're right
about him making his way

26:52.840 --> 26:54.774
into someone's pocket.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.107
WATSON:
In the meantime,
I'll go through

26:56.140 --> 26:57.175
Judge Vaughn's
bench record,

26:57.210 --> 26:59.246
look through any
threats he received.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.942
Any luck, we'll find
the same name in both places.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.182
MAN:
I heard about the woman

27:05.220 --> 27:07.313
who broke out
of Pemberton.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.887
You really think that
Trey McCann killed her?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.888
Quite horribly,
in fact.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.194
He might have underwhelmed
you as a corrections officer,

27:14.230 --> 27:15.788
but the evidence suggests

27:15.830 --> 27:17.991
he had a certain zeal
for assassmation.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.668
BELL: _
We were hoping
you could tell us

27:19.700 --> 27:21.292
why you let him go in 2013.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.730
If it had anything to do with
him doing favors for inmates,

27:24.770 --> 27:27.068
it might help us track down
the person who hired him.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.171
There a problem?

27:30.210 --> 27:32.178
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.440
I mean, I can confirm
that Trey McCann

27:34.480 --> 27:38.211
worked for us as a CO. and that
he was terminated for cause,

27:38.250 --> 27:40.047
but anything beyond that
is confidential.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.682
It's company
policy.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.210
Mr. Franklin, you understand
we're trying to solve

27:43.260 --> 27:46.149
three murders, including
that of a sitting judge?

27:46.190 --> 27:48.454
I-I do, and I wish
I could say more.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.229
But as an officer

27:50.260 --> 27:51.898
of Correctional
Administration Group,

27:51.930 --> 27:54.194
I'm legally obligated
to put the company first.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.838
That's what subpoenas
are for, right?

27:57.870 --> 28:00.065
Come back with one,
that'll untie my hands,

28:00.110 --> 28:02.237
and I'll give you
anything you want.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.272
My colleague and I are positing
that Mr. McCann colluded

28:05.310 --> 28:09.246
with convicted criminals during
and thanks to your employ.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.747
If we're right,

28:10.790 --> 28:12.314
I don't imagine that
would play too well

28:12.350 --> 28:14.489
with your shareholders,
would it?

28:14.520 --> 28:17.318
Then again, were it
to reach the media

28:17.360 --> 28:19.954
that C.A.G. was hindering
an investigation

28:19.990 --> 28:21.958
into a judge's murder,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.298
can't imagine that
would play much better.

28:24.330 --> 28:27.026
BELL:
Mr. Franklin, we have

28:27.070 --> 28:29.288
no interest in exposing
your company's secrets.

28:29.340 --> 28:32.332
We only care about Trey McCann
and his associates.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.509
You help us...
how he came to know

28:34.540 --> 28:37.373
those associates _
never has to come to light.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.110
Tell you what--

28:41.150 --> 28:44.278
I will set you up in a room
with the files on McCann.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.345
You can take as long
as you like, but...

28:46.390 --> 28:48.119
nothing in writing
leaves this building.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.425
If it does, the NYPD can
look forward to a lawsuit.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.428
Fair enough?

28:53.460 --> 28:56.293
Looks like we were
onto something.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.969
Says here in 2013 Correctional
Administration Group

28:59.000 --> 29:00.968
found evidence Trey McCann

29:01.000 --> 29:04.800
was running favors for a
Russian bratva, the Zaleslqs.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.364
He was bringing
contraband in and out

29:06.410 --> 29:08.105
of a prison in
East Orange for them

29:08.140 --> 29:10.370
and setting their guys up
with the best work details.

29:10.410 --> 29:11.547
The official reason given
for his termination

29:11.580 --> 29:12.979
is excessive absences.

29:13.010 --> 29:15.808
So, obviously,
C.A.G. were trying to keep

29:15.850 --> 29:18.410
misconduct off the record
and out of the press.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.543
Got to think it helped
him get a new job

29:20.590 --> 29:22.512
with Reform Enterprises.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.052
Question is: Was he still
in the pocket of the Zaleskys?

29:26.090 --> 29:28.957
If he was, they more than fit
the bill of an organization

29:29.000 --> 29:30.968
with the means
to orchestrate three murders.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.798
I'll text Joan, ask her to
see if any of their people

29:33.840 --> 29:36.468
recently had brushes
with Judge Vaughn.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.228
She spoke with you?

29:40.270 --> 29:42.306
About Detective Scott?

29:42.340 --> 29:45.173
Yep.

29:45.210 --> 29:47.303
Sorry.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.069
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.849
Well, I'm not sure I agree.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.283
I have what some might call
a strong personality.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.857
Nah.

29:59.890 --> 30:03.155
Sometimes, without meaning to,

30:03.200 --> 30:05.521
I can bend others
to my pomt of View.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.569
Like a magnet exposed
to other metals.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.830
Forks in a drawer, for example.

30:11.870 --> 30:15.101
I have a tendency
to magnetize people around me,

30:15.140 --> 30:18.007
drawing them into alignment
with my own ways.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.268
What the hell
are you talking about?

30:20.310 --> 30:22.471
Watson's time with me
has been marked

30:22.520 --> 30:25.444
by increasing social isolation.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.584
The captain-- perhaps
by coincidence, perhaps not--

30:28.620 --> 30:30.485
is now also alone.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.580
You found someone.

30:33.630 --> 30:36.053
Now they're gone.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.422
You think you broke us up
with the power of your mind?

30:39.470 --> 30:42.337
I'm just pointing out
a pattern.
Holmes,

30:42.370 --> 30:45.908
you're no magnet,
and I'm sure as hell not a fork.

30:45.940 --> 30:48.977
You are,
in your own way, Marcus,

30:49.010 --> 30:51.308
a lonelier man than me.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.339
What?

30:52.380 --> 30:54.541
Well, I, at least, have Watson.

30:54.580 --> 30:57.219
You...

30:59.590 --> 31:02.218
You deserve more.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.399
She's I.A.

31:09.430 --> 31:12.194
The great love of my life
is a homicidal maniac.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.135
No one's perfect.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.362
Detective Scott made you happy.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.504
That much is obvious, so...

31:21.540 --> 31:23.974
perhaps she still can.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.149
WATSON:
I wish there was something more
we could tell you.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.284
The Zaleskys are still thriving
in some parts of the state,

31:31.320 --> 31:32.446
but they are as
good as dismantled

31:32.490 --> 31:34.082
in Judge Vaughn's district.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.656
He hasn't put away anyone

31:35.690 --> 31:38.250
with even a loose affiliation
with them in over a decade.

31:38.290 --> 31:39.928
BELL: _
There might still be
a connection we're not seeing.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.497
I got a buddy at the FBI's
Newark field office.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.260
I'll reach out to him,
see if he has any thoughts.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.619
Do it soon.

31:46.670 --> 31:49.161
I got the Chief of D's
breathing down my neck,

31:49.200 --> 31:52.431
governor's office in Jersey is
taking a lot of heat over this,

31:52.470 --> 31:55.268
and they're in
a sharing mood.
It's an election year.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.971
It's hard_ to run a
tough-on-crime platform

31:57.010 --> 31:59.103
with this mess
in the news.
What if that was the point?

31:59.150 --> 32:01.277
Create a news story tailor-made
to embarrass the governor,

32:01.320 --> 32:03.311
and then_ influence
the upcoming election.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.682
You think this could be
all politics?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.585
Do any of us doubt
that a political operative

32:07.620 --> 32:09.383
would stoop to such measures?

32:09.420 --> 32:11.559
Governorship of New Jersey is
a lucrative position to control.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.182
It's worth billions each year

32:13.230 --> 32:15.528
in contracts
to one's cronies.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.255
Were it not for our involvement,

32:17.300 --> 32:19.564
what would be the top news story
in the tri-state area today?

32:19.600 --> 32:22.569
"Escaped inmate murders judge
and guard.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.965
Still on the loose."

32:24.010 --> 32:26.228
"Governor at a loss."

32:26.270 --> 32:27.737
According to this,
his biggest competition

32:27.770 --> 32:30.204
is an assemblyman
named Cortland Hughes.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.470
He's been taking swipes
at the governor all week.

32:32.510 --> 32:36.219
So has his campaign
manager, Andrea Schuster.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.672
We know that name.
Yeah.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.585
She's the woman
Loretta Nichols said

32:39.620 --> 32:42.453
she was having drinks with
when Judge Vaughn was killed.

32:42.490 --> 32:45.050
She was her alibi.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.058
LORE'I'I'A:
You people are insane.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.251
Well, you're the one who gave us
Miss Schuster's name.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.518
We just want to make sure
we got our facts straight.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.128
There aren't any facts, okay?

32:53.170 --> 32:54.569
Because I didn't
do anything wrong.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.160
Andrea and I have been friends
for years.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.701
Then you know
she's a political strategist

32:58.740 --> 33:00.628
with a vicious reputation--
no move too low.

33:00.670 --> 33:03.275
So, because I had drinks
with her, uh, that means

33:03.310 --> 33:06.370
that I am a part of a plot
to bring down my boss

33:06.410 --> 33:08.048
and murder a man
that I loved?

33:08.080 --> 33:09.479
BELL:
It's one possibility.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.010
You had intimate knowledge

33:11.050 --> 33:12.688
of the judge's movements
the night he was killed.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.551
You could have steered him
into an ambush.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.217
What kind of monster
do you think that I...?

33:16.260 --> 33:17.579
WATSON:
Like he said,
it's one possibility.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.429
It's not the only one.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.052
Given your relationship with the
judge, we're willing to believe

33:21.100 --> 33:23.056
that you did not know
the plan involved his murder.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.022
BELL:
Now, if that's the case,
we'll recommend

33:25.070 --> 33:26.526
the DA consider you
an unwitting party

33:26.570 --> 33:28.060
who got in over her head.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.795
I didn't get into anything.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.161
Andrea and I worked together
when we first started out.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.098
Did she approach me
about switching teams?

33:34.140 --> 33:35.505
Yes, all the time.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.247
Did I ever take it seriously?
Absolutely not.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.645
Miss Nichols...
No.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.147
I have been trying

33:41.180 --> 33:42.738
to clean up this mess
ever since it started.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.247
You don't believe me,
check my phone logs.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.746
Talk to my assistant.
No, you know what?

33:45.790 --> 33:47.382
Better yet,
talk to the governor.

33:47.420 --> 33:50.082
Ask him who's been handling
every media request.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.519
Ask him who convinced him

33:51.560 --> 33:53.551
to sever ties
with Reform Enterprises.

33:53.590 --> 33:56.252
See if he has any doubt as
to where my allegiances lie.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.268
Reform Enterprises--
they own the prison

33:58.300 --> 34:00.268
where Nikki Moreno
was held, right?

34:00.300 --> 34:02.359
The governor has a close
relationship with the CEO,

34:02.400 --> 34:04.664
which, as you can imagine,
has become a major liability.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.735
We were gonna turn over
another state prison to them.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.237
Now we can't.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.134
The reasons must be clear,
even to you three.

34:10.180 --> 34:11.499
Of course they are.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.519
You would have had
a PR nightmare on your hands.

34:14.550 --> 34:17.474
Any other company submit bids
to take over the prison?

34:17.520 --> 34:19.681
Why?

34:19.720 --> 34:23.178
There's a chance one of them
has a killer in their employ.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.290
Captain Gregson.
This is, uh, Joan Watson.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.867
You know Detective Bell
and Mr. Holmes.
Yes, Captain.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.697
Everyone, come on in. I'm sorry
I'm so pressed for time.

34:37.740 --> 34:40.402
No, it's us who should
be apologizing to you.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.169
We're the ones
who rescheduled

34:42.210 --> 34:43.472
on you this
morning.
It's not a problem.

34:43.510 --> 34:45.375
Happy to help the NYPD
any way I can.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.105
Well, you must
be busy,

34:47.150 --> 34:48.640
what with the
new contract

34:48.680 --> 34:49.715
to take over the state
prison in Union County.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.286
You got a lot riding
on that, huh?

34:51.320 --> 34:53.743
As much as anybody here.
Well, sure, but you're also

34:53.790 --> 34:55.348
in charge of growth
and expansion.

34:55.390 --> 34:57.153
Your bonuses_are tied
to new busmess.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.124
Uh, yep, I guess.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.855
It's not something
I like to focus on.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.289
HOLMES:
Really?

35:02.330 --> 35:04.366
I imagine I would focus on it
quite intently.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.220
WATSON:
When you add up all the
sources of income--

35:06.270 --> 35:07.464
money from the state,

35:07.500 --> 35:09.695
kickbacks from corporations
for cheap labor,

35:09.740 --> 35:12.129
all the fees you collect
from the inmates themselves--

35:12.170 --> 35:15.776
a new prison is worth about
$25 million a year, isn't it?

35:15.810 --> 35:17.835
HOLMES:
And acquiring even one
new prison in New Jersey

35:17.880 --> 35:20.201
must be a daunting
task, especially given

35:20.250 --> 35:22.241
the governor's connection
to Reform Enterprises.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.372
Yeah.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.183
Is that why
you resorted to murder?

35:25.220 --> 35:27.711
What?
WATSON:
Everything you arranged--

35:30.190 --> 35:32.488
all of it was _
about creating a scandal so big,

35:32.530 --> 35:36.193
the governor had no choice but
to distance himself from R.E.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.221
HOLMES:
Correctional Administration
Group is the only other

35:38.270 --> 35:40.226
private prison company
in the state.

35:40.270 --> 35:42.238
So, R.E.'s loss
these last few days

35:42.270 --> 35:43.669
has been your considerable gain.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.305
I think I'd like you
to leave now.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.376
I would want us to leave, too.

35:48.410 --> 35:51.277
This photograph was taken
four nights ago at the same

35:51.310 --> 35:52.868
fund-raiser that
Judge Vaughn attended.

35:52.910 --> 35:54.844
WATSON:
You were there to
watch him, right?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.347
Find just the right time

35:56.380 --> 35:58.348
to stab him
with that screwdriver?

35:58.390 --> 36:00.642
GREGSON:
You heard your old
employee, Trey McCann,

36:00.690 --> 36:03.284
had caught on at RE,
and you saw an opportunity.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.221
He was the kind to take
bribes, get his hands dirty.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.399
All you had to do
was find his price

36:08.430 --> 36:10.318
for killing Nikki Moreno.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.464
That's crazy.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.298
Where's the tuxedo
you're wearing in this photo?

36:15.340 --> 36:17.934
Don't hurt yourself.
We already had a feeling

36:17.970 --> 36:19.631
you got rid of it.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.207
That appointment we made
this morning and then canceled

36:22.240 --> 36:23.935
_at the last minute_--
it was so state police

36:23.980 --> 36:26.301
could execute a search warrant
on your house.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.977
HOLMES:
Your tuxedo is conspicuous
by its absence,

36:28.010 --> 36:29.375
presumably because
it is spattered

36:29.420 --> 36:30.512
by the blood of
Judge Vaughn.

36:30.550 --> 36:31.847
The police, however,
found your gun.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.380
A nine millimeter.

36:33.420 --> 36:34.455
Ballistics are forthcoming.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.355
We have a strong
suspicion it will be

36:36.390 --> 36:38.654
a match for the weapon used
to perforate Trey McCann.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.328
They're gonna read you
your rights now.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.521
When you call your
lawyer, remind him

36:44.570 --> 36:46.822
you got two murders in Jersey
and one in New York.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.338
Now, given the way
you guys do things here,

36:49.370 --> 36:51.907
I'd push to serve my time
in New York.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.281
(sighs)

37:12.330 --> 37:14.457
You were the one
who texted, Marcus.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.327
I'm sorry about the other day.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.588
Were you ever gonna tell me?

37:22.640 --> 37:25.734
I don't know.

37:25.770 --> 37:28.330
Well, I want to take it back.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.439
The whole day,
everything I said.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.742
Did you not mean it?

37:31.780 --> 37:33.600
(laughs)
I was angry.

37:35.850 --> 37:39.047
Marcus...
No, I-I want
to try again.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.389
The last few months-- they've
been really good for me.

37:42.420 --> 37:45.457
As far as I can tell,
they were good for you.

37:45.490 --> 37:46.980
And all that other stuff--

37:47.030 --> 37:49.453
it shouldn't have anything
to do with us.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.956
What if everybody knew?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.468
What?
What if I told everyone?

37:53.500 --> 37:56.560
All the cops at the 11th,
all your friends.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.329
Would that change things?

37:58.370 --> 37:59.906
I don't know what you...

37:59.940 --> 38:02.329
Would it change things?

38:03.440 --> 38:05.579
I thought a lot
about what you said.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.544
All the secrets
I have to keep,

38:07.580 --> 38:09.969
the idea that I take shots
from the shadows.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.419
Seana".

38:11.450 --> 38:14.089
I'm leaving the 12th.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.554
I'm transferring
to IAB full-time.

38:16.590 --> 38:18.558
I'll still be a detective,
but at least now

38:18.590 --> 38:21.593
people will know
exactly what I am.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.690
No more secrets,
no more shadows.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.925
And you were right.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.996
These last few months
have been good.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.703
But this is... this is
gonna be a big change for me,

38:33.740 --> 38:36.709
and... now I'm gonna
need some time.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.999
If you still want
to look me up

38:40.050 --> 38:41.938
after the dust
settles,

38:41.980 --> 38:44.346
you'll know where to find me.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.391
(doorbell ringing)

39:02.470 --> 39:04.529
You got a minute?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.374
Ah.
I don't know
which is weirder.

39:09.410 --> 39:12.504
The fact that I'm spending
my Friday night with you,

39:12.550 --> 39:15.371
or the Stanley
freaking Cup.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.974
You sure this_is
the genume article?

39:18.020 --> 39:20.716
Positive.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.718
The NHL has been notified,

39:22.760 --> 39:25.581
and will be here to
reclaim it shortly.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.958
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.059
After a night celebrating
the Cup victory in 1905,

39:31.100 --> 39:33.489
members of the Ottawa Silver
Seven felt it necessary

39:33.530 --> 39:36.465
to see if they could kick the
cup into Ottawa's Rideau Canal.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.606
So, this is nothing.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.707
You honestly think
I'm lonelier than you?

39:44.750 --> 39:46.877
By a factor of ten.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.516
Well, it's tough.

39:50.550 --> 39:53.644
Meeting women,
the hours I keep.

39:53.690 --> 39:56.887
You are the most dedicated
police detective I know.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.423
That takes its toll.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.690
But a balance
can be struck.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.049
I, myself, will be having sex

40:04.100 --> 40:05.897
in less than an hour.

40:06.970 --> 40:08.665
One of your "friends"?

40:08.700 --> 40:11.908
My friends have friends,
you know?

40:11.940 --> 40:14.477
Some of them might
even be desirous of

40:14.510 --> 40:15.772
a relationship.

40:17.780 --> 40:23.047
Another night, maybe.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.082
Tonight, pretty sure
this is all I need.
