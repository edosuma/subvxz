<i>Connor ran off

00:03.969 --> 00:07.303
As of noon today, all of the Meade
accounts have been totally cleared out.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.534
We clean up our own mess.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.736
I'm gonna start liquidating
my personal assets.

00:10.777 --> 00:11.835
Everything I've got.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.539
I'll contribute as much as I can.

<i>I have a son now,

00:22.622 --> 00:26.888
Have to be careful, though, sometimes,
remind myself that I am not his mother.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.485
<i>But a bus,
really, Daniel?</i>

00:28.528 --> 00:30.155
This is the lowest moment of my life.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.994
For God's sake, hold on to the pole!

00:32.031 --> 00:33.727
No way,
I don't know who touched that thing.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.234
My family is sort of really wealthy.

For the record, I've decided
the limo treatment doesn't suck.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.988
Noted. Also for the record,
I'm not really a limo kind of guy.

01:35.028 --> 01:38.464
I just thought it might be fun,
since it's, you know, Tuesday.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.331
Tuesday.
Now officially known as Limo Day.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.097
But seriously, Matt, stop pampering me.
It makes me feel guilty.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.230
Damn. There goes
Hot Air Balloon Wednesday.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.535
Sounds good, doesn't it?
Seriously, I can make that happen.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.636
I know. I believe you, but it just...

01:52.679 --> 01:57.139
It all feels like a little much, you know,
with the cutbacks at work, and...

01:57.184 --> 02:00.551
I know, I know, but for you,
Hot Air Balloon Wednesday,

02:00.587 --> 02:02.487
Submarine Thursday...

02:02.522 --> 02:05.980
As long as it makes you happy,
just name it. Anything.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.460
Well, I don't think you could make me
any more happy,

02:08.495 --> 02:09.519
but I'm gonna go out on a limb

02:09.562 --> 02:11.394
and say that things at work
are gonna get better.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.659
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:12.699 --> 02:15.190
It's sort of my grand unified theory
of happiness.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.259
With us so good,
how could work be bad?

02:22.375 --> 02:23.399
Coming through.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.910
Excuse me, sorry, just trying to get out.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.243
Hey, watch it.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.208
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What is going on?

02:32.252 --> 02:34.015
Hey! That's mine.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.751
No, he's not available. Please hold.

- Amanda.
- Hey!

02:42.262 --> 02:44.924

Breathe, Mandy, breathe.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.395
Guys, what is going on?

02:49.469 --> 02:53.098
We're being looted. I feel so violated.
And not in a good way.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.641
Didn't you hear?
The "Sex" issue was a limp noodle,

02:55.709 --> 02:57.870
and now they've cut the budget
to the bone.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.071
God, this is so depressing.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.639
I just used the word "noodle"
and "bone," and I got nothing.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.413
Apparently, everything leased or
considered non-essential has to go.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.751
I'm looking for Betty Suarez.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.354
Do you need any help
loading her onto the truck?

03:14.060 --> 03:17.860
- You need my ID for a delivery?
- It's protocol.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.503
Sign here.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.236
And here.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.903
Is this all really necessary?

03:30.944 --> 03:34.345
Initial here. And I need your thumbprint.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.315
My thumbprint?

03:37.417 --> 03:38.543
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

03:38.585 --> 03:39.609
Whoa!

03:39.653 --> 03:41.518
The Calvin Hartley
Charitable Foundation requires

03:41.554 --> 03:43.317
positive identification of all recipients.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.256
The Hartley Charitable Foundation?

03:45.292 --> 03:48.523
Did he say the Hartley
Charitable Foundation?

03:48.561 --> 03:51.394
Daniel, what's going on?
They're repossessing everything.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.992
Betty... Please, with
everything falling apart around here,

03:55.068 --> 03:57.536
just let me have this moment.

04:00.373 --> 04:03.604
Every year, Cal Hartley hosts
a charity Easter egg hunt

04:03.643 --> 04:05.440
at the Museum of Natural History.

04:05.478 --> 04:08.606
- Wait. Cal Hartley?
- It's incredibly exclusive.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.178
I've been trying to score an invite
for years.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.149
Daniel, I think maybe this might be...

04:16.856 --> 04:19.290
"The Calvin Hartley
Charitable Foundation

04:19.326 --> 04:23.057
"is pleased to invite Betty Suarez"?

04:24.464 --> 04:27.228
Cal Hartley is Matt's father.

04:28.535 --> 04:33.165
Of course. Matt Hartley. I don't know
why I never put that together.

04:33.239 --> 04:37.369
So, things are going really great
with you and Matt, I guess.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.141
- Yeah.
- Seeing as you got the big egg-vite.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.283
Here you are.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.219
Sorry, Daniel. I had no idea.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.519
No, no, it's fine. I'm sure you're gonna
have fun mingling with the billionaires

04:51.558 --> 04:55.255
and the princesses
and the popes and the...

04:55.295 --> 04:58.264
Sorry, Daniel, one second. Hello.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.425
Aunt Betty, don't ever break up
with Matt.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.958
- Why do you need my fingerprints?
- What are you talking about?

05:03.036 --> 05:05.561
<i>We just got an invitation to
the Hartley Easter egg hunt.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.105
<i>Do you know how exclusive this is?</i>

05:07.173 --> 05:09.266
<i>I'm a US citizen.
- I have an idea.</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:13.245
- I have rights, you know.
- Grandpa, give him the thumbprint.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.645
You're not going
to mess this up for me.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.377
Go.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.511
Look, Justin, I don't really
have time for this right now,

05:20.553 --> 05:22.020
but I'll call you back, okay? Bye.

05:26.693 --> 05:27.751
Everything okay?

05:27.794 --> 05:32.356
Yeah, he was just really excited
about going to the Hartley thing.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.858
Your family got an egg-vitation?

05:56.689 --> 05:59.988
That is beautiful, Willie.
You are one magnificent mama.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.463
Thank you, Miles.
Can we take a break, please?

06:05.165 --> 06:08.532
Christina. Come get him.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.402
Come on, little man.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.906
My back is killing me.

06:13.940 --> 06:18.309
You poor thing. You've been holding
him for, what? A whole five minutes.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.403
Try doing it for nine months.

06:20.447 --> 06:24.349
Yes, yes, yes, you're a saint.
And his diaper's full, as well.

06:25.318 --> 06:29.186
Miles, darling, thank you so much
for capturing these precious moments.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.885
It's my pleasure, Wilhelmina.
That woman...

06:32.926 --> 06:34.553
She's my surrogate.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.961
She's helping me out until I find
a more suitable nanny arrangement.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.794
Was she your egg donor as well?

06:39.833 --> 06:43.793
What? No.
Why would you suggest such a thing?

06:43.871 --> 06:46.203
Well, the baby doesn't
exactly look like you.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.765
But, Miles, his father's white.
What do you expect?

06:48.843 --> 06:50.367
I mean, he'll brown up eventually.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.775
No, it's not just that, Wilhelmina.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.246
My business is seeing,
especially faces,

06:54.281 --> 06:57.341
and your child really looks
like that woman.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.944
Well, that's preposterous.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.152
Listen, not to worry,
I can work wonders with Photoshop.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.855
I'll give him the Slater chin.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.934
- Wow.
- Yep, that's Dad.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.131
Please adopt me.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.606
Forget it, unless you take me, too.

07:54.642 --> 07:58.339
Matt, we really appreciate you
inviting us to your father's fundraiser,

07:58.379 --> 08:01.712
but I just feel we wouldn't fit in.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.809
Don't even go there, Grandpa.
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.843
Yeah, and I hear that they have a real

08:06.887 --> 08:07.979
Faberge egg

08:08.022 --> 08:11.287
hidden in with the Easter eggs.
I'm so finding it.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.690
Fabergé.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.827
No, sweetie, when
there's an "E" at the end, it's silent.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.230
Matt, are you sure you want to do this?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.167
I mean, I didn't exactly start off
on the right foot with your mom,

08:22.236 --> 08:24.170
and I was hoping for less pressure
with your dad.

08:24.205 --> 08:26.173
You know, maybe we could
have him over for dinner.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.040
<i>Papi could cook, and we'll just talk
about mountain climbing.</i>

08:30.077 --> 08:33.376
Well, you know,
meeting my father is a really big deal.

08:33.414 --> 08:36.212
I mean, this guy turns down
invitations to the White House.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.774
Matt, you're not helping.

08:37.818 --> 08:42.881
Look, the point is, four
former presidents want to meet that guy.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.552
But to me, "that guy" is Dad.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.223
Betty, I want you to meet my dad.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.097
Okay. All right, we're in.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.897
What!

09:02.910 --> 09:05.708
I figured the best way to make
a good first impression on Mr. Hartley

09:05.746 --> 09:07.213
was to learn as much about him
as I can.

09:07.248 --> 09:09.182
Did you know he went into outer space?

09:09.216 --> 09:13.016
I wish I was that rich.
I'd like to go into outer space.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.113
Wow, there are, like,
a million interviews with him.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.215
<i>Here's one
in the Dubai Financial Times.</i>

09:18.259 --> 09:22.093
"Hartley made his reputation riding
to the rescue of struggling companies. "

09:22.129 --> 09:24.461
I'd like to rescue struggling companies.

09:24.498 --> 09:27.160
Daniel, we are a struggling company.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.498
Listen. "Among the assets
Hartley considers

09:29.570 --> 09:32.640
"undervalued and ripe for reinvestment
are media companies,

09:32.640 --> 09:35.871
"including newspaper
and magazine publishing. "

09:36.510 --> 09:38.603
- He said that?
- Yeah.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.245
Daniel, what if we got Hartley
to invest in Meade?

09:43.284 --> 09:46.742
- He could be our white knight.
- He could save the company.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.287
No, but Hartley is
notoriously hard to get to.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.050
- Do you really think you can set it up?
- Are you kidding?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.394
Matt would be more than happy to set
up a meeting with you and his father.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.832
- Betty, if you can pull this off...
- I can do it.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.259
- I can't do it.
- It's just a meeting.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.361
I can't.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.269
Daniel only wants a chance
to talk to your dad.

10:06.307 --> 10:08.275
Look, everybody wants
to talk to my father.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.606
Invitations to the White House,
remember?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.874
Everybody in the world always wants
something from him.

10:12.913 --> 10:16.144
No, but, Matt, it's not like that.
This is an opportunity for him.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.707
And it's always an opportunity.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.982
Betty, look, you have to trust me.
It is not a good idea.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.422
- But, Matt...
- No. I'm sorry. The answer is no.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.587
I don't know what to do.
Daniel really needs my help,

10:55.622 --> 10:57.556
but I don't want to do
anything to upset Matt.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.616
Poor Matt.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.619
You don't know how much pressure is
on these rich people. It's incredible.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.359
And what do you know
about rich people?

11:05.399 --> 11:08.994
<i>Excuse me? I've been watching
Dynasty on the Soap channel.</i>

11:09.069 --> 11:10.229
They're not like us.

11:10.304 --> 11:12.204
<i>Listen, I don't know about Dynasty,</i>

11:12.239 --> 11:14.230
but if the choice is between
disappointing your boss

11:14.308 --> 11:17.539
or keeping your rich boyfriend happy,
show me the money.

11:17.578 --> 11:19.910
Yeah, it's like
when Blake has to choose

11:19.947 --> 11:22.245
between his wife Krystle
and her lookalike Rita,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.375
also played by Linda Evans
in a red wig.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.850
Catch up, people.

11:28.155 --> 11:32.091
<i>You know, mi hija, you tried to help out,
and it didn't work.</i>

11:32.126 --> 11:36.062
Daniel will understand.
Just tell him the truth.

11:36.096 --> 11:40.328
<i>You're probably right, papi.
I should just tell him the truth.</i>

11:42.736 --> 11:46.968
Look at little William here. This shot
really brings out that Slater chin.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.306
Honestly, Willie, you haven't had
a Slater chin since 1981.

11:50.344 --> 11:52.972
Well, look at these cheekbones, see?

11:53.881 --> 11:57.317
Well, as much as I live
to tell you what you want to hear,

11:57.351 --> 11:59.216
I don't think babies have cheekbones.

11:59.253 --> 12:01.915
Well, then he must take
after Bradford, I suppose.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.014
Actually, except for
the fish-belly complexion,

12:04.057 --> 12:06.048
I don't see Bradford in there, either.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.831
- What's this all about, Willie?
- Nothing, I guess. It's just...

12:13.901 --> 12:17.837
Well, Miles says the baby looks
a lot like Christina.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.169
Oh, my God, he does.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.704
I mean, does he? Really? I don't see it.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.712
Marc, this is my baby.

12:25.746 --> 12:29.807
I don't care what that overrated
lens-jockey Miles Foster says.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.080
- I know my own child.
- Of course you do.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.484
Why are we even discussing this?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.852
We were both there
when they did the procedure.

12:35.889 --> 12:40.121
It was your egg mixed
with Bradford's swim team.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.186
The baby can't be Christina's.
It's medically impossible.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.961
- Actually, it is medically possible.
- You're joking.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.662
If the surrogate had sexual intercourse
before the implantation,

12:49.736 --> 12:51.465
it's possible she was already pregnant.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.005
In that case,
your egg wouldn't have taken,

12:53.073 --> 12:55.439
and the baby would be
her biological child.

12:57.311 --> 12:59.142
Well, that's all very educational.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.715
Thank you for coming down, Doctor.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.013
- That's it?
- Yes.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.282
Because you said it was urgent.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.855
- I rushed out of surgery to get here.
- Thank you.

13:18.465 --> 13:23.869
Marc, dear God,
William might not be mine.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.668
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, it's... It's unacceptable.

13:26.707 --> 13:28.504
Without little William's share
of the company,

13:28.542 --> 13:30.407
I go back to being a paid employee

13:30.444 --> 13:33.140
with Daniel's girlish fingers
at my throat.

13:33.180 --> 13:37.913
I need you to find out if Christina had
sex right before the procedure,

13:37.951 --> 13:39.919
and do it discreetly.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.066
- Daniel, I need to talk to you.
- And I want to talk to you, too.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.262
All right, guys, thank you, everyone.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.635
Good work. I think it's time to go home
and get some rest.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.073
Have you been here all night?
Why didn't you call me?

14:02.109 --> 14:04.077
Well, I know you're busy with Matt.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.579
We decided to go all-in
on your Hartley idea.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.637
- All-in?
- Yep.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.911
I called in marketing,
ad sales, the art department...

14:09.950 --> 14:13.181
And we put together such a kick-ass
proposal for my meeting with Hartley.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.279
Daniel, before you start kicking ass...

14:15.322 --> 14:20.089
Just wait till you see what we came up
with. We are gonna blow him away.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.859
<i>For over 100 years,
Meade Publications has helped</i>

14:23.897 --> 14:28.857
<i>to educate, inform, and entertain
generations of Americans.</i>

14:28.936 --> 14:32.838
<i>Now, leading this bold charge
into the next millennium</i>

14:32.873 --> 14:36.934
<i>is a true visionary,
businessman, humanitarian,</i>

14:36.977 --> 14:40.640
<i>and world-class athlete, Daniel Meade.</i>

14:41.915 --> 14:45.146
- Athlete?
- Yeah, I was on the crew team, JV.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.517
Besides, if Hartley's gonna put money
into Meade, the company,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.717
he's got to have confidence
in Meade, the man.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.350
Did you notice I got that guy

14:52.392 --> 14:54.155
who did the voice for Hartley's
to do mine?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.924
- Daniel, I...
- I mean, it's still a work in progress.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.194
We're gonna Photoshop the margarita
out of my hand,

14:59.266 --> 15:02.429
maybe put in, like, an orphaned baby.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.403
Betty, I gotta tell you,
this is the first time in months

15:04.438 --> 15:07.236
I feel like we actually have a chance.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.166
So, what do you think?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.273
He's gonna love it.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.309
You're gonna knock his socks off
in that meeting.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.445
You didn't really say
"knock his socks off," did you?

15:20.487 --> 15:23.422
It just came out. What am I gonna do?

15:23.457 --> 15:26.654
Daniel thinks that this meeting with
Hartley could help save the company,

15:26.693 --> 15:28.558
and I have to tell him
it's not even going to happen.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.758
Well, the man is a "true visionary,"
so he may already know.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.399
There he is.

15:34.468 --> 15:38.199
There's the little product of
an unholy deal with the devil.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.330
Yes, you are.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.341
- You're so good with him.
- Who knew?

15:42.376 --> 15:45.971
I thought my only maternal instinct
was nursing a bottle of whiskey.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.605
Stuart's coming by in a little while,

15:47.648 --> 15:49.809
and we're gonna go
for a walk in the park.

15:49.850 --> 15:53.251
- How is Stuart?
- Better, actually.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.083
At first we thought
the treatment wasn't working,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.056
but he seems to be improving.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.490
And you should see him
with this little ankle-biter,

15:59.526 --> 16:02.654
all cooing and making faces.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.163
So, what are you gonna do
about Daniel?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.824
I don't know,
but I just have to make sure

16:05.866 --> 16:08.902
that he and Matt do not see each other
until I figure it out.

16:10.537 --> 16:14.906
<i>- Speak of the devil. Hello?
Hey, it's me.</i>

16:14.941 --> 16:18.900
Bye-bye.
Hi, I was just about to call you.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.345
<i>Okay, we're still talking. That's good.</i>

16:21.381 --> 16:24.418
<i>I just want to say
I'm sorry I lost it about,</i>

16:24.418 --> 16:26.181
<i>you know, Daniel wanting
to meet my dad,</i>

16:26.219 --> 16:28.414
<i>and I was hoping
I could take you out to lunch.</i>

16:28.455 --> 16:30.719
That sounds great.
Where do you want to meet?

16:30.757 --> 16:33.055
Actually, I'm heading
toward your desk right now.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.321
What?

16:34.695 --> 16:36.890
<i>Don't go to my desk.
I'm not at my desk.</i>

16:40.667 --> 16:45.331
Let's play a game. You try to find me.

16:45.939 --> 16:49.238
Sort of like
a sexy scavenger hunt?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.073
<i>Yeah, yeah, I guess.</i>

16:53.747 --> 16:56.215
Okay, here I come.

16:57.651 --> 16:59.243
<i>Where are you?</i>

17:04.023 --> 17:07.186
Hey, I have a lunch uptown.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.195
Good. Have a good lunch.

17:10.731 --> 17:12.061
Thanks.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.094
Warmer, warmer...

17:21.208 --> 17:22.675
Found you.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.578
Don't make me TASER you.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.982
Cold! Ice cold. Freezing, freezing.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.615
Hey, I forgot my briefcase on your desk.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.628
Oh, no. Go back to the elevator.
I'll go get it.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.186
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'll see you there.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.342
Have a good lunch.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.882
Thanks.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.485
Found you.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.719
- You found me. You win.
- Yes.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.054
- Betty, I totally forgot my... Hey, Matt.
- Hey, Daniel.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.087
- We should probably just get going.
- Okay.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.359
I can't thank you enough for setting up

18:19.399 --> 18:21.128
- this meeting with your father.
- Daniel...

18:21.168 --> 18:22.260
Excuse me?

18:22.335 --> 18:25.634
I really think it'll be an incredible
investment opportunity for him.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.333
I didn't set any meeting.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.076
- What?
- I told Betty I couldn't do it.

18:31.878 --> 18:35.041
Betty, what's going on?

18:35.715 --> 18:38.240
Yeah, Betty, what is going on?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.923
Why did you tell him
I'd set up a meeting with Dad?

18:46.960 --> 18:50.657
- Well, I didn't exactly.
- Yes, you did.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.030
Look, I can explain this,
just not with both of you right here.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.068
Daniel, will you go wait for me
in the conference room?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.263
- I have a lunch...
- Please?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.511
I was going to tell him this morning,

19:06.546 --> 19:10.573
but when I came in, he'd been up
all night working on a proposal.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.983
I didn't want to break his heart.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.816
Look, Betty, he was gonna
find out eventually.

19:14.855 --> 19:18.188
Yes, but I was hoping
that I could talk to you again.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.887
Remember when you said
that I could ask you for anything?

19:20.927 --> 19:23.589
- Submarine Thursdays?
- Okay, Betty. Betty, that was different.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.621
It's just a business meeting

19:25.665 --> 19:28.395
between the head of Meade
Publications and a potential investor.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.198
- It has nothing to do with us.
- But it does.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.499
Betty...

19:33.607 --> 19:38.044
Being Cal Hartley's son,
it's like I'm two different people, right?

19:38.078 --> 19:41.013
There's the guy whose father is worth
more than most OPEC countries,

19:41.047 --> 19:43.072
and then I'm the guy
who writes about sports

19:43.116 --> 19:47.143
and forgets his wallet,
and gets a lump in his throat

19:47.187 --> 19:50.020
every time his girlfriend smiles at him.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.918
Betty, there's my dad
and business and money,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.451
and then there's me, my life,

19:56.496 --> 19:59.897
and you're part of my life, aren't you?

19:59.933 --> 20:02.367
Yes, of course.

20:11.245 --> 20:13.805
- Daniel...
- Why didn't you just tell me he said no?

20:13.848 --> 20:17.409
Because you were so excited.
I didn't want to disappoint you.

20:17.451 --> 20:19.442
So you let me look like an idiot?

20:19.487 --> 20:22.581
- I thought I could change his mind.
- And?

20:23.357 --> 20:24.654
Sorry.

20:25.526 --> 20:26.959
I don't know what else to do, Daniel.

20:26.994 --> 20:31.488
I know how important this is to
the company, but Matt is my boyfriend,

20:31.532 --> 20:35.969
and if this is what he wants,
then I have to respect that.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.129
I understand.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.033
You do?

20:41.108 --> 20:43.906
I imagine Matt's got
to have his reasons.

20:43.945 --> 20:45.207
Family can be

20:46.180 --> 20:49.877
complicated. I ought to know.
It's okay, Betty.

20:51.452 --> 20:53.386
So what are we going to do?

20:53.421 --> 20:55.855
Well, I admit
things don't look very good,

20:55.890 --> 21:00.293
but we're not ready
to turn the lights out just yet.

21:00.328 --> 21:04.526
We'll figure something out.
There are always other options.

21:04.565 --> 21:07.762
- There are no other options.
- Well, I can't accept that.

21:07.835 --> 21:09.302
Face the facts, Daniel.

21:09.370 --> 21:13.898
We barely cobbled together the cash
to put the last issue on the newsstands.

21:13.975 --> 21:17.775
The government's not going to help us,
and the banks won't touch us.

21:17.812 --> 21:20.747
What you're talking about,
we agreed we were not there yet.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.749
Well, we're there now.

21:22.783 --> 21:26.082
The company has survived
for over 100 years.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.486
<i>People were reading Mode
during the past two world wars,</i>

21:28.522 --> 21:31.582
they were burning it for warmth
during the Great Depression.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.288
I mean, I will be damned if I'm gonna
explain to my son, your half-brother,

21:35.329 --> 21:36.626
that we stood by and let it die.

21:36.664 --> 21:38.495
I certainly don't want that, either,
but what are we...

21:38.532 --> 21:42.298
We have poured every penny
into keeping this magazine afloat,

21:42.370 --> 21:44.338
money of our own.

21:45.306 --> 21:48.139
If we let it go under, we have nothing.

21:54.782 --> 21:57.546
It's time to make some tough choices.

22:14.368 --> 22:17.565
You're right. I'll take care of it.

22:22.343 --> 22:26.279
Hey, I've been thinking,
we don't really talk very much.

22:26.313 --> 22:28.440
That's because
we don't like each other very much.

22:28.482 --> 22:31.212
And it tears me up inside.

22:31.252 --> 22:34.312
We've been spending so much time
together because of the baby.

22:34.355 --> 22:36.619
- We should be pals.
- I'm good, actually.

22:36.657 --> 22:40.058
You know what's a fun thing
for us girls to do? A sex quiz.

22:40.094 --> 22:46.397
I am in. My sex IQ is crazy high.
I'm like the Einstein of sex.

22:48.602 --> 22:52.732
Okay. "What is your favorite season
to have sex?"

22:52.807 --> 22:56.641
Fall! No. Spring! Winter! No. Summer.

22:56.677 --> 22:58.042
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

22:58.079 --> 23:00.673
I heard "summer. " Good answer.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.547
Like June?
Don't you love having sex in June?

23:03.584 --> 23:08.612
June 14th at 3:02 p. m.
I was in the ladies' room at the UN.

23:08.656 --> 23:13.093
János. He's the delegate from Hungary,
and he was.

23:14.195 --> 23:15.822
I have a pornographic memory.

23:15.863 --> 23:20.493
Okay, back to Christina.
Sizzling summer sex-capades, go.

23:20.534 --> 23:23.469
Why are you so interested
in my sex life?

23:25.673 --> 23:27.732
What? It's just a quiz.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.543
I started to think about it,
and then I realized... June.

23:36.584 --> 23:38.882
That was when I had
Wilhelmina's egg implanted,

23:38.919 --> 23:42.320
and the only reason that he would
want to know if I'd had sex...

23:42.356 --> 23:45.018
- He's a pervert?
- No, listen.

23:46.127 --> 23:48.061
Do you remember a couple of days
before the procedure,

23:48.095 --> 23:51.223
we went out to dinner to that little pub
on the Lower East Side?

23:51.265 --> 23:53.790
Yeah, yeah, you were pretty upset
about the whole thing.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.268
You must have had,
what, five or six pints?

23:56.337 --> 23:57.429
Couldn't keep your hands off me.

23:57.505 --> 23:59.268
Shut up. Just listen.

23:59.373 --> 24:02.865
They told me I wasn't supposed
to have sex before the procedure,

24:02.910 --> 24:04.878
but I thought it was just the one time,

24:04.912 --> 24:06.971
and the chance of
anything happening...

24:08.616 --> 24:12.074
Christina, could he be our son?

24:13.988 --> 24:15.216
What are we going to do?

24:16.991 --> 24:20.358
Well, I've got to talk to Wilhelmina,

24:22.062 --> 24:23.791
and we've got to find out the truth.

24:31.338 --> 24:32.362
Good morning.

24:32.439 --> 24:34.202
Come here, come here,
get in here.

24:34.241 --> 24:38.177
- They're handing out pink slips.
- What? Are you serious?

24:40.114 --> 24:44.517
This is like a reality show. I hate myself
for watching, but I can't look away.

24:44.552 --> 24:46.645
Not Sven, not Sven.

24:49.089 --> 24:50.989
Well, I guess that'll save
some awkward conversation

24:51.025 --> 24:52.322
by the coffee machine.

24:52.359 --> 24:54.020
This is crazy.

24:55.296 --> 24:56.763
Oh, my God.

25:08.609 --> 25:10.804
Sorry, Amanda.

25:15.449 --> 25:16.916
Amanda?

25:22.456 --> 25:23.514
I'm fired.

25:26.627 --> 25:30.085
- This must be some sort of mistake.
- I know, right?

25:30.130 --> 25:34.032
I mean, I understand them
getting rid of the lunch intern

25:34.068 --> 25:37.526
and the creepy copy guy
and all those editors,

25:38.672 --> 25:40.503
but I'm Amanda Tanen-Sommers.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.771
Mandy, I am so sorry.

25:43.410 --> 25:47.870
<i>But I am the face of Mode. I am Mode.</i>

25:47.915 --> 25:50.008
I'm the first person they see
when they walk in.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.951
Who's going to welcome them now
and tell them where to sign in?

25:56.323 --> 25:57.915
But they need to see something pretty.

26:01.028 --> 26:05.522
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
This isn't the end of the world.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.591
Someone's gonna hire you in a second.

26:07.635 --> 26:12.572
Really? Because I can do a job that a
clipboard and a vase of flowers can do?

26:12.606 --> 26:13.868
Mandy.

26:13.907 --> 26:18.571
<i>Marc, I don't belong anywhere else.
I belong at Mode. This is my home.</i>

26:18.612 --> 26:20.045
What am I going to do?

26:25.653 --> 26:29.487
Daniel, Amanda was just fired.
What's going on?

26:29.523 --> 26:33.254
Look, before you panic, your job is safe.
You're too valuable to let go.

26:33.927 --> 26:35.952
Well, thanks,
but what about everyone else?

26:35.996 --> 26:37.759
I thought you said there were options.

26:37.798 --> 26:41.791
Well, unfortunately, it turned out
there really was only one option.

26:41.869 --> 26:44.463
- Fire everybody?
- Do you think I like firing people?

26:44.538 --> 26:46.836
I like Amanda.
I like Jenny in accounting.

26:46.874 --> 26:50.708
It was either cut the payroll
or file for bankruptcy.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.144
Then none of us would have jobs.
Is that what you want?

26:53.180 --> 26:55.614
No, no, of course not.

26:55.649 --> 26:57.708
Betty, we shut down
five magazines today.

26:57.751 --> 27:01.778
That's hundreds of employees.
I didn't have a choice. I'm sorry.

27:04.224 --> 27:06.283
I'm getting you that meeting
with Hartley. Come on.

27:06.327 --> 27:08.921
- I don't have an egg-vitation.
- Daniel, it's now or never.

27:08.962 --> 27:12.159
He's leaving for a trans-Siberian
motorcycle race right after the party.

27:12.199 --> 27:13.257
Yeah, but what about Matt?

27:13.300 --> 27:14.961
How's he gonna feel about
you going behind his back?

27:15.035 --> 27:16.263
I hope he understands.

27:38.258 --> 27:40.886
Faberge. Come to Mama.

27:41.195 --> 27:43.993
Damn. Here.

27:51.905 --> 27:53.099
Hey.

27:54.375 --> 27:55.706
Hey.

27:55.743 --> 27:58.177
- Matt, I have something I...
- You look really pretty.

27:58.645 --> 27:59.703
Thank you.

27:59.813 --> 28:03.044
- So, ready for the moment of truth?
- Yep.

28:06.153 --> 28:08.815
Hey, guys, why don't you come over
and meet my dad? He's right here.

28:08.856 --> 28:11.017
Yeah? All right. Here we go.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.423
Dad, I would like you
to meet the Suarez family.

28:14.461 --> 28:19.694
- Justin, Hilda, Ignacio, my father.
- It is a pleasure.

28:19.733 --> 28:22.463
- Mr. Hartley, sir.
- No, please, call me Cal.

28:22.536 --> 28:24.970
Justin, Hilda, are we treating you okay?

28:25.005 --> 28:28.031
Yeah. Hey, listen,
you wanna give me a hint

28:28.108 --> 28:29.939
- on where the Faberge egg is?
- Mom.

28:29.977 --> 28:32.775
I don't think that would be fair
to my other guests.

28:33.814 --> 28:36.647
And this must be the young lady
that I've been waiting to meet.

28:36.683 --> 28:39.481
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hartley.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.683
I heard you made quite an impression
on Matt's mother.

28:42.723 --> 28:46.159
I think the words she used were,
"Over my dead, rotting corpse. "

28:46.193 --> 28:48.753
- Dad...
- Well, the thing is, I don't really...

28:48.796 --> 28:53.859
Anyone who can get under my ex-wife's
skin like that is okay in my book.

28:55.202 --> 28:58.569
Now, I would love to spend
the whole afternoon just with you,

28:58.639 --> 29:01.073
but I have to spend some time
with my other guests,

29:01.141 --> 29:03.541
so, please, everybody,
have a good time.

29:03.577 --> 29:07.035
And I'll just... I'll...
I'll see you later. Bye-bye.

29:07.448 --> 29:10.383
Wow. I never shook a hand
that's been in outer space before.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.214
- See? Piece of cake.
- Yeah.

29:14.721 --> 29:18.452
Work stuff that I just have to deal with
real quick, but I'll be back.

29:18.492 --> 29:20.016
Okay.

29:27.401 --> 29:29.801
Daniel. What are you doing?

29:29.870 --> 29:32.498
Where have you been?
There's security everywhere,

29:32.573 --> 29:34.268
and people are starting
to look at me weird.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.808
Because you're supposed
to be a waiter,

29:35.843 --> 29:39.472
but you're standing around eating
cookies in a $ 10,000 Prada suit.

29:39.513 --> 29:41.003
This is from two years ago.

29:41.048 --> 29:42.879
All right, look, I met Mr. Hartley.

29:42.916 --> 29:46.750
- What's he like?
- He's interesting but nice,

29:46.787 --> 29:49.585
and I think he'll be open
to your thoughts. Are you ready?

29:49.623 --> 29:52.592
- I think so.
- Okay. Maybe leave the cookie.

29:55.996 --> 30:00.660
You had sex? Do I need to remind you
that we had a signed contract?

30:00.701 --> 30:03.192
What, you're going to sue me
for having sex?

30:03.237 --> 30:05.228
I gave you a great deal of money,

30:05.305 --> 30:07.865
money that was supposed to help save
your dying husband.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.499
At least part of him was
alive and kicking.

30:09.576 --> 30:11.476
Don't get all high and mighty with me.

30:11.512 --> 30:13.537
You rammed that contract
right down my throat.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.571
And you knew exactly
what you were getting yourself into.

30:15.616 --> 30:18.244
And you knew that I couldn't say no.

30:18.285 --> 30:19.775
God, the contract was barely dry

30:19.820 --> 30:22.186
before I was lying on my back
with my legs in the air,

30:22.222 --> 30:24.383
someone waving a turkey baster at me.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.490
Lovely.

30:27.661 --> 30:31.131
I want to know
what we're going to do now.

30:31.131 --> 30:35.090
Because there is a chance that
that baby is mine.

30:35.135 --> 30:38.593
- An infinitesimal chance.
- It's still a chance.

30:38.672 --> 30:43.109
I need to know whose baby that is,
and so do you.

30:43.944 --> 30:45.707
Yes, I do.

30:48.615 --> 30:52.210
We'll get a blood test, then we'll know.

30:54.488 --> 30:55.819
Right.

31:03.864 --> 31:06.628
There he is. Let's go.
- Okay.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.529
Whoa! Sorry.

31:11.772 --> 31:14.841
Excuse me, sir,
may I see your credentials?

31:14.841 --> 31:17.332
- What? Yeah, of course. Hey.
- Hi.

31:18.378 --> 31:22.314
Just a second. I...
Sorry. I had them a second ago.

31:22.349 --> 31:24.579
You know what?
He's with me, so it's okay.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.609
He needs his own invitation, ma'am.

31:26.653 --> 31:30.384
This is outrageous.
I want both of your names right now.

31:32.025 --> 31:33.788
Do you have a pen?

31:34.094 --> 31:36.756
Okay, mistake. Sorry.

31:36.797 --> 31:39.664
Please, just let him go. I can explain.

31:40.267 --> 31:43.464
Come on. Listen...
Listen, he can clear this up.

31:55.048 --> 31:56.879
- I know you're mad.
- You lied to me.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.977
Matt, Amanda got fired today,
along with about half of Meade

32:00.020 --> 32:02.511
and I couldn't just come here
and drink champagne

32:02.556 --> 32:04.922
and hunt for Easter eggs and pretend
like nothing was happening.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.926
- What was I supposed to do?
- You could have come to me.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.450
Would you have changed your mind?

32:11.932 --> 32:13.524
Is this really what you want?

32:14.234 --> 32:16.532
Matt, you mean so much to me,

32:16.603 --> 32:18.571
but if giving Daniel five minutes
with your dad

32:18.639 --> 32:22.370
is gonna help him save Meade,
then, yes, it's what I want.

32:25.779 --> 32:29.146
Hey. Hey, hey. It's okay. He's with me.

32:35.822 --> 32:39.918
Dad, I'd like to introduce you
to Betty's boss, Daniel Meade.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.791
It's an incredible honor, sir.

32:41.828 --> 32:45.855
Meade, huh? I don't recall seeing
your name on the guest list.

32:46.066 --> 32:50.025
That's a funny story,
actually.

32:51.805 --> 32:54.774
Come on, I'm just messing
with you. Let's have a drink.

32:54.841 --> 32:56.832
Great, great, great.

32:58.945 --> 33:00.913
Matt, thank you.

33:12.225 --> 33:14.887
I know you've shown
an interest in media stocks.

33:14.928 --> 33:19.297
<i>Of course I read your amazing
interview in the Dubai Financial Times.</i>

33:19.966 --> 33:24.903
Anyway, Meade Publications is
poised to rebound in a big way...

33:31.945 --> 33:33.913
- Mr. Hartley?
- Cal.

33:34.748 --> 33:38.185
Cal, everything all right?

33:39.053 --> 33:43.786
I raise a lot of money at this shindig
every year for a lot of terrific causes.

33:44.225 --> 33:49.060
But what I love about it most is
the kids, you know?

33:50.531 --> 33:52.931
- Absolutely.
- The simple joy on a child's face.

33:52.967 --> 33:55.333
That's what it's really about.

33:57.038 --> 34:00.064
I couldn't agree with you more.
Anyway, all Meade needs

34:00.208 --> 34:02.176
is a short-term infusion of operating...

34:02.210 --> 34:05.179
It's such a shame
Floppy couldn't make it.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.974
- Floppy?
- Yeah, Floppy the Bunny.

34:10.016 --> 34:14.818
He's the guy we hired to put on the
big pink bunny suit and hand out eggs.

34:14.856 --> 34:18.656
- Just totally flaked on us.
- That is a shame.

34:20.762 --> 34:22.889
As I was saying,
a short-term infusion of capital...

34:22.929 --> 34:26.366
We got the suit and everything.
We just need someone to put it on,

34:27.001 --> 34:31.335
hop around, wiggle his nose...

34:31.405 --> 34:33.998
That'd sure make this day
a success, don't you think?

34:34.074 --> 34:35.542
Make those kids smile.

34:37.879 --> 34:40.074
And seeing those kids' smiling faces

34:40.114 --> 34:43.743
would sure put me in the mood
to talk business.

34:54.795 --> 34:57.765
I got it! I got the egg!

34:59.033 --> 35:01.866
<i>Congratulations. Now, why don't you
step up here, young lady?</i>

35:01.903 --> 35:05.862
<i>- Okay, excuse me, excuse me.
- Excuse me, kids. Here we go.</i>

35:05.940 --> 35:08.465
<i>Now, since you found
the Fabergé egg,</i>

35:08.543 --> 35:11.205
<i>valued at more than
half a million dollars...</i>

35:11.245 --> 35:12.803
Oh, my God!

35:12.847 --> 35:15.441
<i>...it will now be auctioned off,
and the proceeds donated</i>

35:15.483 --> 35:18.111
<i>to New York Children's Hospital
in your name.</i>

35:21.022 --> 35:22.546
But I... I found it.

35:22.590 --> 35:26.287
- I found the egg, sir. This isn't fair.
- All right, sweetheart. Time to go.

35:27.528 --> 35:29.519
<i>Isn't she wonderful?</i>

35:30.164 --> 35:32.064
No. I found the egg.

35:43.444 --> 35:45.435
Are we finished?
Do you hate me, Matt?

35:45.513 --> 35:47.276
Because I hate me right now, and...

35:47.315 --> 35:51.115
No. No, no, I could
never hate you. Never.

35:52.186 --> 35:54.950
And you were right.
People's jobs are at stake.

35:54.989 --> 35:56.354
I mean, your friends are getting fired

35:56.390 --> 35:58.654
because I have
some crazy rich-boy daddy issues.

35:58.693 --> 35:59.717
That's messed up.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.218
No, Matt, I still should not have
gone behind your back.

36:03.264 --> 36:05.892
True, you owe me for that one.

36:05.933 --> 36:08.595
I may have to cancel
Submarine Thursdays.

36:09.837 --> 36:13.432
Betty, I just hope you don't regret
hooking Daniel up with my father.

36:13.507 --> 36:15.031
Why would I?

36:15.109 --> 36:18.738
My dad can be a great guy, but you do
not want to go into business with him.

36:18.779 --> 36:22.772
He needs to control everything.
I've spent my entire life

36:22.817 --> 36:25.945
trying to keep him as far away
from my career as possible.

36:25.987 --> 36:29.684
That's why I didn't want him investing
in Meade, working in publishing.

36:29.724 --> 36:32.420
I mean, I finally found something
that was mine.

36:32.460 --> 36:35.088
But, Matt, you don't even work
at Meade.

36:35.129 --> 36:39.259
But you do. Betty, you don't know
where this could lead.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.166
Come on, it can't be that bad.

36:42.470 --> 36:44.131
It's Floppy!

36:44.572 --> 36:46.904
Floppy!

36:48.843 --> 36:50.504
Hi, Floppy!
Hi, Floppy!

36:55.116 --> 36:56.743
Is that Daniel?

36:57.451 --> 36:59.112
I want an egg.

37:00.488 --> 37:02.422
It's Daniel Meade.

37:03.891 --> 37:06.291
You thought my mom was
the tough one?

37:06.327 --> 37:08.158
My mom is like an Easter egg,

37:08.195 --> 37:11.528
hard on the outside,
but soft and gooey on the inside.

37:11.565 --> 37:15.092
Dad's more like Satan.

38:08.889 --> 38:13.952
Daniel, I am so sorry.
I had no idea this would happen.

38:14.328 --> 38:16.660
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

38:16.697 --> 38:18.961
Matt tried to warn me,
and I wouldn't listen,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.730
- and his father humiliated you.
- Betty.

38:24.071 --> 38:25.538
We did it.

38:26.741 --> 38:28.106
What?

38:28.142 --> 38:32.545
I just spent 10 minutes with Hartley,
running the numbers. He's in.

38:33.547 --> 38:38.211
He's actually delaying his trip to Siberia
so we can make a full proposal.

38:38.986 --> 38:42.854
He said he looks forward to being
in the publishing business.

38:43.391 --> 38:45.552
Oh, my God! That's amazing.

38:47.094 --> 38:49.756
Well, but what about all of this?

38:50.297 --> 38:53.164
It's just to prove what a big man he is.

38:53.634 --> 38:56.330
- So, you knew what he was doing?
- Yeah, of course I did.

38:56.404 --> 38:59.498
I've been dealing with ego-driven
bastards like him my whole life.

39:00.307 --> 39:02.832
No, I've made a fool of myself
enough times for no reason.

39:02.877 --> 39:05.641
I can do it once to save our company.

39:06.714 --> 39:10.172
Daniel, I'm so proud of you.

39:13.254 --> 39:14.744
What's that?

39:15.856 --> 39:19.792
It's just my cottontail.
I was using it to stop the bleeding.

39:20.928 --> 39:23.328
Those kids were vicious, huh?

39:37.244 --> 39:39.371
Here they are,
the lab results.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.440
You haven't opened it?
- No, I...

39:43.217 --> 39:46.277
I didn't have the nerve.
You... You open it.

39:55.896 --> 40:00.458
It's yours. The baby's yours.

40:02.837 --> 40:04.065
Thank God.

40:04.138 --> 40:06.868
I was just... I was so sure.

40:07.608 --> 40:12.875
Well, now that that is settled,
I will be making other arrangements

40:12.913 --> 40:14.938
- for William's care.
- What do you mean?

40:14.982 --> 40:17.917
I will no longer be needing
your services as nanny.

40:17.952 --> 40:19.146
Given the circumstances,

40:19.186 --> 40:22.644
I think it's best that
you stay away from my child.

40:23.757 --> 40:25.247
Permanently.

40:32.266 --> 40:36.760
<i>There's a light that just won't go out</i>

40:36.837 --> 40:40.273
<i>No matter what they try to do</i>

40:40.307 --> 40:41.706
Morning.

40:42.643 --> 40:47.103
<i>'Cause you can't pull out the circuits</i>

40:47.148 --> 40:49.946
<i>Remove the bulb</i>

40:49.984 --> 40:51.246
Messages.

40:51.285 --> 40:52.718
<i>Or blow the fuse</i>

40:53.187 --> 40:58.090
<i>And it just might be the brightest star</i>

40:58.325 --> 41:02.091
<i>Discovered yet by man</i>

41:03.430 --> 41:07.696
<i>But it might as well be a pin hole</i>

41:07.735 --> 41:14.241
<i>From where we stand</i>

41:14.241 --> 41:18.041
<i>So don't feel bad</i>

41:19.647 --> 41:23.811
<i>Don't look so sad</i>

41:24.685 --> 41:27.950
<i>We're much more than that</i>

41:27.988 --> 41:31.947
<i>But for now it's a deathtrap</i>

41:34.094 --> 41:35.857
A carrot basket.

41:38.265 --> 41:41.029
At least Hartley
has a sense of humor.

41:44.605 --> 41:47.301
<i>It's a deathtrap</i>

41:48.876 --> 41:52.505
<i>And it's gonna get worse</i>

42:09.630 --> 42:12.463
<i>And it's gonna get worse</i>

42:13.305 --> 42:19.876
