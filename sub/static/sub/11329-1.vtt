Of The Amrican Teenager":</i>

00:02.550 --> 00:07.254
-Having sex ruined everything for us.
-Not continuing to have sex ruined everything for us.

00:07.288 --> 00:10.056
I made the mistake of asking
Anne if there was any possibility

00:10.091 --> 00:11.491
that the baby might not be mine,

00:11.526 --> 00:13.026
so Anne took the baby and
went to see her mother.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.929
But they're coming back.
I do love Amy,

00:15.963 --> 00:18.498
but I want to be with other girls.
I want to have sex.

00:18.533 --> 00:19.833
Dad, if you want Mom back,

00:19.867 --> 00:21.568
you better get on the phone right now.

00:21.602 --> 00:22.903
She's seeing her old high-school boyfriend.

00:22.937 --> 00:25.038
I'm going to get some
kind of legal agreement

00:25.072 --> 00:26.239
so that John doesn't just disappear

00:26.274 --> 00:27.541
anytime you feel like taking off.

00:27.575 --> 00:29.075
This is Jimmy. Can I call you?

00:29.110 --> 00:31.711
Want to go back with me?
We haven't resolved anything.

00:31.746 --> 00:34.514
We are a family even though
you and I aren't a couple.

00:34.549 --> 00:37.083
Jack and I are just
friends and nothing more.

00:37.118 --> 00:38.952
Even though we're just friends now,

00:38.986 --> 00:40.954
I still wouldn't want you to
have sex with any other guy.

00:40.988 --> 00:43.356
You need a boyfriend.
We have to get you a boyfriend.

00:43.391 --> 00:46.459
Wow. Wow what?
Griffin was right. I think I might like you.

00:46.804 --> 00:49.029
I want to get married.
Me, too.

00:49.063 --> 00:52.966
We're getting married.
Oh, my God, Mom!

00:53.000 --> 00:55.101
Did your dad remarry? She's not my mother.

00:55.136 --> 00:58.071
Yeah, I don't do anything with her.
I think Ricky's in love wi you, too.

00:58.105 --> 01:00.640
If Amy's having sex with Ricky,
I'm having sex with Ben.

01:00.675 --> 01:02.976
Somebody told you? You slept with Amy,
and I slept with Ben.

01:03.010 --> 01:06.213
I had sex with Adrian,
and now Ricky is going to pummel me.

01:06.247 --> 01:07.814
We hope you get married soon

01:07.848 --> 01:10.050
and be together and happy
for the rest of your lives.

01:10.084 --> 01:12.919
How about tonight? If you're
 tired of sleeping on the couch

01:12.954 --> 01:15.889
and you want to sleep
in the bedroom, you can.

01:15.923 --> 01:21.127
Take off the baseball cap.
I want to take John on weekends. No.

01:21.162 --> 01:22.929
Ricky's not going to get John.

01:22.964 --> 01:24.497
If we don't give Ricky what he wants,
he'll go to court.

01:24.532 --> 01:27.434
Probably the best thing is
for you to get a mediation.

01:27.468 --> 01:30.070
You have to be on the
pill for at least a month.

01:30.104 --> 01:32.706
I hope that's why I'm late.
Do you mind if I go on the pill?

01:32.740 --> 01:33.807
For what?

01:33.841 --> 01:38.778
I know what we worked out was fair,
but just it seems so unfair still.

01:38.813 --> 01:42.449
I only wish that I had married
your mother when I should have.

01:42.483 --> 01:45.986
<i>I think the person that I should have with
me when I take this test is Ben.</i>

01:46.020 --> 01:49.356
I am proud to present
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Boykewich.

01:49.390 --> 01:50.924
Ben called me last night.

01:50.958 --> 01:55.161
He left a message for me,
told me that he loves me.

01:55.196 --> 01:57.831
Adrian tell Ben yet?
I think she's telling him right now.

02:09.509 --> 02:13.146
-I got your call. What's going on?
-Don't panic. It's good news.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.050
I started my period. I'm not pregnant.
Oh, thank God. Really? Really.

02:20.521 --> 02:22.389
So you're off the hook.

02:22.423 --> 02:24.591
Adrian, I never thought of
it as being on the hook,

02:24.625 --> 02:26.926
but this is good news for both of us.

02:26.961 --> 02:30.096
Yeah, it is.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

02:30.131 --> 02:32.399
Sure. Oh...

02:39.240 --> 02:40.907
We've been trying to get in touch
with you for over 24 hours.

02:40.941 --> 02:42.876
What the heck is going on?
At least he's smiling.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.911
Last time we saw you, you weren't smiling.

02:44.945 --> 02:46.646
You look like you've
been run over by a truck.

02:46.681 --> 02:48.315
We just figured you had
sex with Adrian again.

02:48.349 --> 02:51.551
You better not have. I didn't.
So what is going on?

02:51.585 --> 02:52.652
Nothing.

02:53.954 --> 02:56.856
Okay, I guess I was going
to tell you sooner or later.

02:59.093 --> 03:00.260
Adrian thought that she was pregnant.

03:02.963 --> 03:05.899
Wait, you and Adrian
thought you were pregnant?

03:05.933 --> 03:08.034
Yeah, but we're not. What made
you think you were pregnant?

03:08.069 --> 03:10.937
She took an early pregnancy test,
and it was positive.

03:10.971 --> 03:13.573
You know positive means she
is pregnant, don't you?

03:13.607 --> 03:16.009
Evidently the test was wrong.
She's not pregnant.

03:16.043 --> 03:19.112
She started her period this morning.
Oh, congratulations.

03:19.146 --> 03:20.914
Hold your congratulations. Are you sure?

03:20.948 --> 03:24.517
I didn't verify it,
but she just told me she did,

03:24.552 --> 03:26.419
and there would be no reason for her to lie.

03:26.454 --> 03:27.854
Oh, I don't know about that.

03:33.694 --> 03:35.829
So? So, nothing.

03:35.863 --> 03:37.997
I guess I was just late,
and then I got anxious,

03:38.032 --> 03:40.834
and then I got my period.
Thank God. Yeah, whatever.

03:40.868 --> 03:43.970
Look, I don't want to talk about this,
and I don't want you to talk about this.

03:44.004 --> 03:46.306
I don't want anyone to know that I
even thought there was a problem.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.607
I completely understand.

03:47.641 --> 03:49.976
I don't care if you completely understand.

03:50.010 --> 03:53.012
What I care about is that you
don't say anything to anyone.

03:53.047 --> 03:54.647
Make that to anyone else.

03:54.682 --> 03:56.950
You don't want me to tell
Jack that everything's okay?

03:56.984 --> 03:59.018
Okay, tell him that,
and then just leave it at that.

03:59.053 --> 04:01.821
What about Madison? Can I tell Madison?
Because I know he told her.

04:01.856 --> 04:06.860
He said he didn't. It's Jack. He lies.
No, you just tell him everything is okay,

04:06.894 --> 04:09.896
and we told Madison, and he'll just tell her

04:09.930 --> 04:12.832
everything is okay on his own.
You don't have to tell her.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.367
The less said about everything, the better.

04:14.402 --> 04:19.939
What if Madison told Amy?
She better not have.

04:19.974 --> 04:21.574
I have to go.

04:22.777 --> 04:27.480
-Hey, wait up.
-Hi. How are you?

04:27.515 --> 04:30.750
I'm fine, so I wanted to let you know that.

04:30.785 --> 04:32.485
I'm fine. Okay.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.655
What I thought might've
happened didn't happen.

04:35.689 --> 04:38.057
All right. You didn't tell anyone, did you?

04:38.092 --> 04:40.226
Who would I tell?
That's not a no.

04:40.261 --> 04:42.862
There's nothing to tell.
That's still not a no.

04:44.198 --> 04:47.934
I told my dad. What?
Why would you do that?

04:49.737 --> 04:52.906
You used me as an excuse so you
can get birth control pills?

04:56.777 --> 04:59.012
I've got to go, and you,
you talk to your dad

04:59.046 --> 05:05.046
and don't talk to anyone else.
You don't want to be friends with her.

05:06.287 --> 05:09.255
She's a bad influence.
Then who should I be friends with?

05:09.290 --> 05:11.891
You? You're a good influence?
I didn't say that.

05:11.926 --> 05:13.626
Don't worry about me.
I've got a mind of my own.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.929
I know. That's what I like about you.

05:15.963 --> 05:19.866
My mind? Yeah.
All right.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.838
Did Ben call Amy yesterday?
No, but he will. He better.

05:24.872 --> 05:27.173
Why? Because she wants him to call her.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.008
And Amy's supposed to
get whatever she wants?

05:29.043 --> 05:31.678
I think she's been through enough
that she should get something she wants.

05:31.712 --> 05:32.879
Yeah, I guess.

05:34.949 --> 05:37.650
If she's busy with Ben, hey,
she pays less attention to me.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.786
And what don't you want
Amy to pay attention to?

05:39.820 --> 05:42.755
My sex life.
You have a sex life?

05:42.790 --> 05:45.859
With who, Grant?
Wouldn't you like to know?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.701
Yeah, maybe I would like to know.

06:00.474 --> 06:03.910
Why would he tell me he loves me
and then not return any of my calls?

06:03.944 --> 06:09.315
-I don't know. Well, don't look at me. 
-I don't know either.

06:09.350 --> 06:11.985
Just I think it's weird.
Don't you think it's weird?

06:12.019 --> 06:15.642
I don't know what weird is anymore.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.927
-Jack problems? Probably.
-She and Jack were supposed to,

06:20.961 --> 06:22.729
you know, do it after the wedding.

06:22.763 --> 06:24.364
And did they?

06:24.398 --> 06:26.533
Let's hope not because she
is not in a very good mood.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.102
If they did do it, they probably
don't feel very good about it.

06:29.136 --> 06:30.670
I know that feeling.

06:32.907 --> 06:36.543
Wait. Did you and Jesse do it?
Why would you say that?

06:36.577 --> 06:38.845
Because if Madison and
Jack were going to do it,

06:38.879 --> 06:40.413
then you two are probably
going to do it, too,

06:40.447 --> 06:41.748
since that's how you and Madison are.

06:41.782 --> 06:43.883
I beg your pardon?
Am I right?

06:43.918 --> 06:47.587
I would tell you if I had sex.
I did not have sex.

06:47.621 --> 06:50.089
The three of us should
just swear off on boys.

06:50.124 --> 06:54.360
Uh-huh. Unless, of course, Ben calls.
Why wouldn't he call me back?

06:54.395 --> 06:55.695
And after telling me he loved me,

06:55.729 --> 06:56.963
why did he avoid me at the wedding?

06:56.997 --> 06:57.997
It just doesn't make any sense.

07:04.204 --> 07:07.840
Did you just see that?
He's still avoiding me. I saw that.

07:09.910 --> 07:13.947
Hey, Grace just told me.
Congratulations, you dodged a bullet,

07:13.981 --> 07:17.717
or Adrian dodged a bullet.
You knew I knew, right?

07:17.751 --> 07:19.953
No. Knew what?
About Adrian,

07:19.987 --> 07:23.890
how she might've been,
you know, but she's not.

07:25.726 --> 07:29.696
Um, all right, sorry I said anything.
Grace said not to say anything,

07:29.730 --> 07:32.765
but I didn't know she meant
not to say anything to you.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.618
It's all good, buddy.

Anne and I are divorced,

and, well, Ashley's
always been closer to me.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.325
She and I have an excellent relationship,

08:01.359 --> 08:02.993
so if she feels she wants to go on the pill,

08:03.027 --> 08:04.495
then I feel she should be on the pill.

08:05.897 --> 08:07.331
Although she's not having sex right now,

08:07.365 --> 08:10.134
and she would tell me if she was,
and I want her to wait until she's 18,

08:10.168 --> 08:14.571
but what if she doesn't
and ends up like...

08:14.606 --> 08:15.973
my other daughter, you know, Amy,

08:16.007 --> 08:18.108
or just gets herself into
some kind of messy situation

08:18.143 --> 08:20.110
like our next-door neighbor,
who thought she was pregnant, but isn't.

08:20.145 --> 08:23.180
I just don't want any mishaps,
so I said okay to her going on the pill

08:23.214 --> 08:25.382
even though you don't need my okay,

08:25.416 --> 08:27.651
but I'm just trying to be prudent.

08:27.685 --> 08:30.888
Prudent?
What?

08:30.922 --> 08:34.091
You know I'm the pediatrician for
both John and Robbie, don't you?

08:34.125 --> 08:37.160
Are you?
So what? Isn't this all confidential?

08:37.195 --> 08:42.032
Of course, Ashley.
It's just that,

08:42.066 --> 08:45.202
George, aren't you and Anne back together?

08:45.236 --> 08:48.505
That's what Anne said, and Amy.
Poor Anne.

08:48.540 --> 08:49.940
She still can't deal with the breakup.

08:49.974 --> 08:51.208
Neither can Amy.

08:51.242 --> 08:53.744
That's why Ashley and I
don't tell them everything.

08:53.778 --> 08:56.146
For example, we don't plan
on telling them about this.

08:56.181 --> 08:58.248
By the way,

08:58.283 --> 09:00.083
I never realized how blue your eyes are.

09:00.118 --> 09:01.552
Dad, please don't.

09:01.586 --> 09:06.089
Ashley, why don't we let your dad step
outside so we can talk. Thank you.

09:06.124 --> 09:11.195
And George, why don't you have a
nurse take a look at your scalp.

09:11.229 --> 09:15.832
I think your hair might be infected.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.134
Yeah, I was thinking that, too.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.469
My head's been kind of
burning for a couple of days.

09:19.504 --> 09:21.738
Okay, thanks. I'll be outside.

09:26.611 --> 09:30.047
You know, Ashley, given your family history,

09:30.081 --> 09:34.685
I think birth control of
some sort is a good decision.

09:34.719 --> 09:41.592
No kidding.
Is John sick?

09:41.626 --> 09:43.860
No, but every other kid in the nursery is,

09:43.895 --> 09:45.162
so they encouraged me to bring them home.

09:45.196 --> 09:46.363
That's probably a good idea.

09:46.397 --> 09:47.431
It's a great idea.

09:47.465 --> 09:50.901
Now I can spend the entire afternoon
with nothing to distract me from the fact

09:50.935 --> 09:52.803
that I still have heard nothing,

09:52.837 --> 09:56.440
absolutely nothing from that stupid Ben.
Can you believe that?

09:56.474 --> 09:58.575
Are you sure you want
to get back with Ben...

09:58.610 --> 10:00.577
even after he and Adrian were together?

10:00.612 --> 10:02.779
Maybe you should just leave it alone.

10:02.814 --> 10:04.681
Just think about something other than Ben.

10:04.716 --> 10:05.949
Like?

10:05.984 --> 10:08.085
There's a whole world out there beyond Ben.

10:08.119 --> 10:13.690
Mom, Ben is... Ben.

10:13.725 --> 10:16.126
He's the first guy I ever loved,
and I still love him,

10:16.160 --> 10:17.461
no matter what he did,

10:17.495 --> 10:20.497
and you know he still loves me.
Well, then, I guess I'll call him.

10:22.066 --> 10:23.200
Oh, hey, wait a minute.

10:23.234 --> 10:26.270
Did Ashley say anything to you
about going out for track?

10:26.304 --> 10:28.972
What? Yeah, your dad said
that Ashley's going out for track.

10:29.007 --> 10:33.243
-Mom, come on. No, she's not.
-Apparently she is.

10:34.062 --> 10:38.115
- Ashley running? Think about it.
- Yeah, I was surprised, too,

10:38.149 --> 10:39.750
but your dad said that
he's taking off work today

10:39.784 --> 10:43.320
so he can be with her at tryouts.
Uh-huh, sure. He did.

10:43.354 --> 10:44.454
If you say so.

10:44.489 --> 10:48.458
Well, why don't you think so?
Mom, it's a lie. It's got to be a lie.

10:48.493 --> 10:50.460
Well, why would your dad and Ashley

10:50.495 --> 10:51.662
lie about her going out for track?

10:51.696 --> 10:53.096
Why would they lie about that?

10:53.131 --> 10:55.165
I don't know. It's not even a good lie.

10:55.199 --> 10:58.935
You're right. It's not.

11:00.171 --> 11:01.938
I just don't understand
why they keep lying to me.

11:01.973 --> 11:03.407
Well, I know why.

11:03.441 --> 11:05.075
Because you don't agree with them,

11:05.109 --> 11:06.743
and they just do what they
always want to do anyway.

11:06.778 --> 11:08.745
What have I not agreed with them on lately?

11:13.151 --> 11:15.252
Birth control pills?

11:18.690 --> 11:22.626
Hey, Adrian, I want to talk to you.
I tried to find you at school,

11:22.660 --> 11:25.128
so call me back, please.

11:25.163 --> 11:27.397
We really need to talk.

11:30.335 --> 11:32.402
Hi. Oh.

11:32.437 --> 11:36.940
Grace, hi. Your butler let me in.
A live-in butler, that's so cool.

11:36.974 --> 11:39.509
And I'm sure the butler enjoyed it as well.

11:39.544 --> 11:43.146
And guess what?
I got my license,

11:43.181 --> 11:44.815
and I thought since you
came over to my house

11:44.849 --> 11:46.249
the day you got your license,

11:46.284 --> 11:48.919
I would come over to your house
the day I got my license,

11:48.953 --> 11:49.986
which is today.

11:50.021 --> 11:55.125
Oh, yeah, and, uh,
thanks for dropping by, Grace,

11:55.159 --> 11:56.626
and congratulations.

11:56.661 --> 11:58.228
It's really great being able to drive a car.

11:58.262 --> 12:01.965
You're going to love it,
but I have to go to work.

12:01.999 --> 12:04.134
Oh, right, work.

12:04.168 --> 12:07.003
I wasn't really sure if you had to
go to work every day after school.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.072
I do. I saw your car in the driveway.

12:09.107 --> 12:12.175
Oh, I came home to change
and just got delayed.

12:12.210 --> 12:15.145
Well, you sure you can't
stay home just this one time?

12:15.179 --> 12:18.315
I brought cookies.
I thought maybe we could celebrate

12:18.349 --> 12:21.351
my good news and your good news.

12:21.386 --> 12:26.923
My good news?
Well, it's Adrian's good news.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.658
You knew that I knew
what was going on, right?

12:28.693 --> 12:31.161
I mean, she must've told
you that she told me,

12:31.195 --> 12:34.064
or you must've figured it out.
Adrian and I are friends,

12:34.098 --> 12:38.301
so I know what was going on
at the wedding and everything.

12:38.336 --> 12:41.538
What was going on?
Adrian thought she was pregnant.

12:43.241 --> 12:45.442
Oh, my. Did she?

12:45.476 --> 12:47.210
Yeah, but it's okay, Ben. I mean, she's not,

12:47.245 --> 12:49.246
but even if she were,

12:49.280 --> 12:52.649
I would still be there for you
because we're friends, too,

12:52.683 --> 12:56.086
and maybe at some point we
can be more than friends.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.423
Grace, I--
I really can't do this right now.

12:59.457 --> 13:02.159
I have to go to work.
All right.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.995
I hope I didn't make things
uncomfortable for you.

13:05.029 --> 13:06.730
I just thought we could talk about anything.

13:06.764 --> 13:10.333
We can. I just-- I have to go. I apologize.

13:10.368 --> 13:13.403
Okay, but can we walk out together?

13:13.438 --> 13:16.740
I really want to show you my car.
And I'd love to see your car,

13:16.774 --> 13:20.076
but my dad asked me to call
him when I was leaving and--

13:20.111 --> 13:21.678
I understand.

13:21.712 --> 13:24.014
I shouldn't have dropped
by without calling first.

13:24.048 --> 13:27.717
Oh, no, that's okay,
and I'm really happy for you.

13:27.752 --> 13:30.654
This is just, uh-- it's bad timing.

13:30.688 --> 13:34.424
Okay. Well...

13:37.695 --> 13:39.062
Bye.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:49.073 --> 13:52.075
<i>Hi, this is Adrian. Please leave a
message.</i>

14:01.406 --> 14:02.573
Where are you?

14:02.607 --> 14:05.776
I have some personal business
that I have to take care of.

14:05.810 --> 14:08.712
You have some professional business
you better take care of first

14:08.747 --> 14:10.080
unless you want to lose your job.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.383
Bunny, please,
I just need the afternoon off.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.752
For what?
It's personal.

14:14.786 --> 14:17.821
Yeah, I've got a lot of personal
things I'd like to be doing.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.791
I need a mani-pedi,
but I don't have time to get one

14:20.825 --> 14:22.159
because I'm working.

14:22.193 --> 14:24.962
It's more important than
that and more personal.

14:24.996 --> 14:28.532
Like what? Please.
All right, all right,

14:28.566 --> 14:30.134
but get your butt back here tomorrow.

14:30.168 --> 14:32.036
And just one more favor. No.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.972
If you could just not
mention this to my dad.

14:36.841 --> 14:40.177
Are you in some kind of trouble?
No-no, I'm not in any kind of trouble.

14:40.211 --> 14:43.614
Is someone else in trouble?
Someone like? Adrian.

14:44.749 --> 14:48.652
Why would you say that?
Because I know Adrian.

14:48.686 --> 14:52.723
Hell, it was Adrian.
I have to go.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.895
Was that Ben? Is he coming in?
He needs some "me" time.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.696
What does that mean?

14:59.731 --> 15:02.132
It means you're the only one working,
the key word being... working.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.768
Something's going on with him,
with him and Adrian.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.570
I think we knew that already, didn't we?

15:06.604 --> 15:08.872
I'm not talking about
what happened in his car.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.642
I'm talking about what happened
since they got out of the car.

15:11.676 --> 15:12.910
The guy's confused.

15:12.944 --> 15:14.611
I think I'm going to go
talk to him after work.

15:14.646 --> 15:17.748
Oh, you're going to go help
someone with their love life, you.

15:17.782 --> 15:20.684
Yeah, me. I care about Ben,
and I care about Amy,

15:20.718 --> 15:22.086
and I don't care about Adrian.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.655
Oh, well, let me ask you this.
Do you care about your job?

15:24.689 --> 15:29.359
Of course. Then stop gossiping
and get back to work.

15:40.305 --> 15:44.741
You know, I-- I really don't
care if Adrian's not pregnant.

15:44.776 --> 15:47.277
I feel like she was almost pregnant,

15:47.312 --> 15:49.012
and, you know, if Amy ever finds out

15:49.047 --> 15:50.414
that I knew and I didn't tell her,

15:50.448 --> 15:52.049
she'd hate me,

15:52.083 --> 15:57.421
so I just-- I can't really think about
doing anything more with you right now.

15:59.324 --> 16:03.527
I mean, on one hand I'm
kind of proud of myself

16:03.561 --> 16:06.897
for not telling Amy or
Lauren or anybody else,

16:06.931 --> 16:11.835
but on the other hand I kind of feel like
maybe I should tell Amy and Lauren,

16:11.870 --> 16:13.971
especially since there's
nothing really to tell.

16:14.005 --> 16:16.874
No, don't say anything.
You can't. Just forget it.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.642
I don't know if I can forget it.

16:18.676 --> 16:21.478
I mean, how do you forget that your
best friend's ex-boyfriend called her up

16:21.513 --> 16:24.581
the night before he found out
that he wasn't having a baby

16:24.616 --> 16:29.920
and told her that he loved her?
Maybe this will help.

16:32.557 --> 16:34.691
I-- I thought we weren't
going to do anything.

16:34.726 --> 16:37.561
I thought we were just going to talk.
We're not doing anything.

16:37.595 --> 16:39.963
Not doing anything doesn't
mean not making out.

16:39.998 --> 16:43.634
Not doing anything just means
we're not going to have sex...

16:43.668 --> 16:47.571
if you don't want.
Well, no, I don't want,

16:47.605 --> 16:49.540
but just so you know,

16:49.574 --> 16:52.643
I am open to having the same kind
of sex we were having before.

16:52.677 --> 16:53.777
If you insist.

17:00.818 --> 17:02.519
I love you.

17:04.388 --> 17:07.590
Okay, um, this is not going to work.

17:07.625 --> 17:11.627
I'm not going to do my stuff just
because you said that you love me.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.266
Oh, my God.
Do you really love me?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.835
Yeah, I really do, Madison,

17:18.869 --> 17:22.573
and I'm not just saying that to get you
to do something that you don't want to do.

17:22.607 --> 17:28.512
I-- I just felt like saying it.
I can't believe you're saying this to me.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.314
I didn't think you were
ever going to say it.

17:30.348 --> 17:32.849
I mean, I wanted you to say it.

17:32.884 --> 17:37.621
Well, so do I get, like,
a promise ring or, like, a necklace

17:37.655 --> 17:38.855
or pin or something?

17:38.890 --> 17:41.458
What? I didn't know gifts were involved.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.961
Well, I can't just tell people
that you told me that you love me.

17:43.995 --> 17:45.562
You have to give me something,

17:45.597 --> 17:47.798
so when people say, "Oh,
where did you get that?"

17:47.832 --> 17:50.567
I can be like, "Oh, Jack gave it to me
when he told me that he loves me."

17:52.136 --> 17:53.503
I don't have a gift.

17:53.538 --> 17:56.039
I was just trying to be spontaneous,

17:56.074 --> 17:57.674
and you know what? You kind of ruined it.

17:57.709 --> 18:02.512
I'm sorry. It's just I can't
really think about you or us

18:02.547 --> 18:06.283
while all I can think about
is poor Amy when she finds out

18:06.317 --> 18:08.085
that Adrian thought she was
pregnant with Ben's baby.

18:08.119 --> 18:12.289
How is she going to find out?
Don't do it, Madison.

18:12.323 --> 18:15.158
Or what?
You won't love me anymore?

18:28.072 --> 18:31.742
What? Adrian?
Yeah, Ben, it's me. What do you want?

18:31.776 --> 18:35.345
-Open your garage door.
<i>-What? - I want to talk to you.</i>

18:35.380 --> 18:38.048
Talk. In person.
In the garage?

18:38.082 --> 18:40.450
Amy came home early.
I can't park on the street.

18:40.485 --> 18:42.719
You're right. Never park
on the street again.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.321
The last time was a disaster.

18:44.355 --> 18:47.724
Look, just tell me what you want.
I don't know if I believe you or not,

18:47.759 --> 18:48.959
that you're not pregnant.

18:55.967 --> 18:58.368
Sometimes the tests are wrong.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.404
Not thatften. They're almost
a hundred percent accurate.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.807
Right, that's what I said.
Sometimes they're wrong.

19:03.841 --> 19:05.475
If you found out that you weren't pregnant,

19:05.510 --> 19:07.611
why didn't you call and tell me,
uh, immediately?

19:07.645 --> 19:09.846
I told you as soon as I saw you.

19:09.881 --> 19:12.149
It's not the kind of
thing you put in a text.

19:12.183 --> 19:13.984
I have a legal mind, you know.

19:14.018 --> 19:18.221
Adrian, I have to ask you this.

19:18.256 --> 19:21.525
Did you... terminate the pregnancy?

19:21.559 --> 19:25.595
Did I have an abortion?
Did you? No, I did not,

19:25.630 --> 19:27.597
but if I had been pregnant

19:27.632 --> 19:30.934
and I decided to have an abortion,
then that would be my decision,

19:30.968 --> 19:33.403
not your decision.
I disagree.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.305
Fine, you disagree.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.375
Fortunately it doesn't matter
if we agree or disagree

19:38.409 --> 19:39.576
because we don't have to make a decision.

19:39.610 --> 19:45.215
I just-- I just get the feeling
that you were lying to me.

19:45.249 --> 19:48.018
I mean, I saw the test results.
I saw the look on your face.

19:48.052 --> 19:52.556
Yeah, I had that look on my face
because I thought I was pregnant.

19:52.590 --> 19:56.293
I'm not, and I didn't get an abortion, okay?

19:56.327 --> 19:57.928
I didn't. Jeez.

19:57.962 --> 20:01.398
I admit that I just wanted
the problem to go away,

20:01.432 --> 20:04.167
but if you made the problem go away,

20:04.202 --> 20:08.071
I would feel really guilty,
really, really guilty.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.373
Did you want to have a baby with me?

20:09.407 --> 20:13.443
No. I mean--
You mean no,

20:13.478 --> 20:15.879
so let's just forget
that this ever happened.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.448
Put that incident in the car behind us
and just move on, okay?

20:18.483 --> 20:22.953
Can we do that?
We made a mistake,

20:22.987 --> 20:28.225
but we're friends, Ben,
and we'll go on being friends...

20:28.259 --> 20:29.559
I hope.

20:32.697 --> 20:33.930
I hope so, too, Adrian.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.533
I'm sorry about this.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.637
I really am. Me, too.
Live and learn, huh?

20:40.671 --> 20:43.640
Yeah, I'll say.

20:43.674 --> 20:48.612
Look, Ben, I feel really badly about
even trying to get back at Amy.

20:48.646 --> 20:51.915
I got a whole new level of
understanding of what she went through

20:51.949 --> 20:53.650
and is going through.

20:55.086 --> 20:57.587
You guys are really good together.

20:57.622 --> 20:59.623
I really hope things work
out between the two of you.

20:59.657 --> 21:01.057
Me, too.

21:02.326 --> 21:07.097
And you and Ricky?
No. No, I don't think so.

21:07.131 --> 21:10.200
I know Ricky's never going to forgive me.

21:12.737 --> 21:15.939
Some day.
Some day he will.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.209
And maybe some day I won't care.

21:19.243 --> 21:22.546
Goodbye.
Bye.

21:28.686 --> 21:29.619
Thank you.

21:46.408 --> 21:49.143
Hey, Buddy, where you going?
Maybe I should take him for a walk.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.380
No, Moose can wait.
Tell me what happened?

21:54.049 --> 21:57.251
You made the team?

21:57.252 --> 21:59.754
They don't give you a uniform
unless you make the team.

21:59.788 --> 22:06.193
Ashley. I'm so proud of you.
Which event?

22:06.228 --> 22:07.328
Track.

22:07.362 --> 22:12.233
The mile? The 50-yard dash?
The 100-yard dash? Any dash?

22:12.267 --> 22:15.803
Uh, the mile. No kidding.
Yeah, and it's a really long way,

22:15.837 --> 22:17.738
and I had to do it over and over again,

22:17.773 --> 22:19.540
so I'm just going to go get some rest.

22:20.842 --> 22:23.544
Go team.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.547
Amy's home? I saw her car.

22:26.582 --> 22:29.517
Yeah, the woman that she works with
encouraged her not to bring John in today

22:29.551 --> 22:32.320
because apparently a bunch
of the babies were sick.

22:32.354 --> 22:34.589
George, I really hope that
you're not lying to me,

22:34.623 --> 22:37.358
you and Ashley, about her making the team.

22:37.392 --> 22:39.327
Why would we lie to you about that?

22:39.361 --> 22:41.596
I don't know. Why would
you lie to me about that?

22:41.630 --> 22:43.731
We wouldn't.

22:43.765 --> 22:44.932
Yeah, she's a really good runner.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.233
Really? Because she never has been.

22:46.268 --> 22:50.037
Well, she is now.
Boy, you should see her go.

22:50.072 --> 22:52.006
What happened to your hair... things?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.541
Oh, I should've gone to a legitimate guy.

22:53.575 --> 22:55.876
They got infected.
I had to have them taken out.

22:55.911 --> 22:57.678
Dr. Hightower's nurse did it for free.

22:57.713 --> 23:00.381
Dr. Hightower's nurse?
Yeah.

23:00.415 --> 23:03.050
Why would you go to our pediatrician
for something like that?

23:03.085 --> 23:04.619
Why didn't you go back to that dermatologist

23:04.653 --> 23:06.320
or whoever put the plugs in?

23:06.355 --> 23:08.556
What, am I on trial here? He moved.
I don't know where he is.

23:08.590 --> 23:11.025
My head's been hurting for days.
I couldn't take it anymore.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.994
Sorry. No new hair.

23:24.106 --> 23:26.107
Ah, you're back already?

23:26.141 --> 23:28.709
I went over to Ben's, but he had to work.

23:28.744 --> 23:31.812
You didn't want to go over to
Adrian's or one of your other friends?

23:31.847 --> 23:33.748
She don't have any other friends.

23:33.782 --> 23:35.082
Yes, I do.

23:35.117 --> 23:37.151
I could've gone over to
show Jack or Madison.

23:37.185 --> 23:42.123
He is your ex-boyfriend,
and she is his new girlfriend.

23:42.157 --> 23:45.026
They're still my friends.
Brand new car

23:45.060 --> 23:46.827
and no place to go.

23:46.862 --> 23:50.965
Poor Grace.
Tom. Yeah, Tom.

23:52.134 --> 23:55.002
Hey, Grace, maybe you
should take Tom for a ride.

23:55.037 --> 23:56.971
I don't think so. See you.

23:57.005 --> 24:00.107
He's just not happy

24:00.142 --> 24:02.309
because I don't think he should drive.

24:02.344 --> 24:03.878
I mean, even if he passed the test,

24:03.912 --> 24:05.546
I don't think he always
uses the best judgment.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.782
And he has road rage when
he's not even driving.

24:07.816 --> 24:10.518
Yeah, sometimes he does.

24:12.621 --> 24:19.460
Honey, you seem sad.
What's going on? Nothing.

24:19.494 --> 24:22.496
I was just hoping to spend a little
bit more time with Ben. That's all.

24:22.531 --> 24:24.565
Are you sure that's all that's going on?

24:24.599 --> 24:26.534
You don't want to spend
some time with Adrian?

24:28.103 --> 24:30.337
Did the two of you get in a fight? No.

24:30.372 --> 24:32.873
There were a lot of lat
e-night phone calls last week,

24:32.908 --> 24:34.175
a lot of whispering going on.

24:34.209 --> 24:35.543
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:35.577 --> 24:37.645
I could hear you every time
I walked past your door.

24:37.679 --> 24:40.381
Did you hear what I was saying? I didn't
stop to listen to what you were saying.

24:40.415 --> 24:43.250
I wasn't eavesdropping. Sorry.

24:43.285 --> 24:46.287
And you know I don't read your
emails or your text messages,

24:46.321 --> 24:48.155
but when you were taking
the driving test today

24:48.190 --> 24:50.357
and you asked me to hold your phone,

24:50.392 --> 24:53.461
I did see a text from Adrian, and it said,

24:53.495 --> 24:56.097
"Remember, not a word to anyone.
I'm serious."

24:56.131 --> 24:58.766
Mom. Honey, I couldn't help but see it.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.000
It was just right there on the screen,

25:00.035 --> 25:01.602
and I can't help but wonder what it means.

25:02.738 --> 25:08.809
What does it mean?
It means she's not pregnant.

25:08.844 --> 25:10.244
She thought she was, but she's not.

25:10.278 --> 25:13.614
Ricky?
No, Ben.

25:13.648 --> 25:16.484
I thought you and Ben were
interested in each other.

25:16.518 --> 25:20.621
Yeah, but I wasn't offering him
the same thing Adrian was offering him

25:20.655 --> 25:23.090
the night Amy shut him out,
so there you go.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.593
I mean, he and Adrian did
something they shouldn't have,

25:25.627 --> 25:28.129
and things went wrong,
and she thought she was pregnant,

25:28.163 --> 25:29.663
and her mom was getting married last week,

25:29.698 --> 25:30.865
so she didn't want to bother her,

25:30.899 --> 25:33.067
and that's what I was talking
to her about all last week.

25:33.101 --> 25:35.302
Wow.

25:35.337 --> 25:37.738
But she's not pregnant? No, she's not.

25:37.773 --> 25:40.141
Well, how is it she thought
she was and then she's not?

25:40.175 --> 25:42.877
I don't know. She was just late.

25:42.911 --> 25:45.513
Honey, it's really sweet that you want
to help people with their problems,

25:45.547 --> 25:48.616
but maybe you should encourage
Adrian to talk to her mom about this.

25:48.650 --> 25:53.053
I know, but I still think she wants to
talk about it now that it's over with.

25:53.088 --> 25:55.589
I wasn't even supposed to tell
anyone this happened, mom.

25:55.624 --> 25:57.525
I mean, she told me not to
tell anyone this happened.

25:57.559 --> 26:00.594
I'm your mom. Hey, it's just between us.

26:00.629 --> 26:05.499
Maybe that doesn't count.
Oh, Grace.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.838
You are a really forgiving person,

26:10.872 --> 26:12.072
and I think it's nice

26:12.107 --> 26:13.574
that you want to still go out with Ben

26:13.608 --> 26:17.111
after all this,
but, I don't know,

26:17.145 --> 26:18.879
maybe you wught to get out there

26:18.914 --> 26:21.348
and meet some new guys.
I don't want to.

26:32.427 --> 26:34.428
See you later, boys.

26:36.398 --> 26:38.399
You stayed home from work
to organize your socks?

26:38.433 --> 26:42.002
No, I stayed home because
I felt like staying home.

26:42.037 --> 26:43.704
I don't think so. Why weren't you at work?

26:43.738 --> 26:46.941
Because I wasn't, so there.
Why are you so happy?

26:46.975 --> 26:48.475
I don't know. I just am.

26:48.510 --> 26:50.811
Yeah. I know you were over at Adrian's.

26:50.846 --> 26:53.180
Adrian told you? No, Adrian didn't tell me.

26:53.215 --> 26:55.649
I just guessed, and then you just told me.

26:55.684 --> 26:58.118
What are you thinking?
You tell Amy you love her,

26:58.153 --> 26:59.620
and then you go have sex with Adrian again?

26:59.654 --> 27:01.288
Hey, no one's having sex with Adrian,

27:01.323 --> 27:02.623
at least I'm not.

27:02.657 --> 27:04.491
Then what were you doing over there?

27:04.526 --> 27:05.426
Just talking. About what?

27:05.460 --> 27:08.596
About not being anything more than friends.

27:08.630 --> 27:10.598
Why did you have to go over
there to talk to her about that?

27:10.632 --> 27:11.732
Because that's how I do things.

27:11.766 --> 27:13.400
Oh, is it?

27:13.435 --> 27:16.270
Yes, I prefer to talk to people fac
e-to-face whenever possible.

27:16.304 --> 27:19.039
Then don't you think it's about
time to talk to Amy face-to-face?

27:19.074 --> 27:22.009
I've been thinking about it.

27:22.043 --> 27:24.311
You called Amy and told her you loved her.

27:24.346 --> 27:26.780
She was at my apartment when she
got the message. I heard it.

27:26.815 --> 27:28.782
Were you lying? No, I was not lying.

27:28.817 --> 27:30.251
Why would you tell Amy you love her

27:30.285 --> 27:31.752
and then spend half the wedding reception

27:31.786 --> 27:33.420
upstairs in your bedroom with Adrian?

27:33.455 --> 27:36.323
I don't have an answer for that,
but we weren't doing anything.

27:36.358 --> 27:37.424
We were just talking.

27:37.459 --> 27:39.860
Just talking with Adrian. Really? About?

27:39.895 --> 27:44.598
Love, life, marriage.
It was a very emotional day.

27:44.633 --> 27:47.635
Does Adrian know that you called
Amy and told her you love her?

27:47.669 --> 27:49.003
As a matter of fact, she does.

27:49.037 --> 27:51.605
Does Grace? Nope.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.408
So you're in love with Amy,
but you had sex with Adrian,

27:54.442 --> 27:55.976
and you're friends with Grace,
but Grace thinks

27:56.011 --> 27:58.812
you could be more than friends,
so you don't want to screw that up

27:58.847 --> 27:59.980
by telling her you're in love with Amy.

28:00.015 --> 28:01.448
I'm in love with Amy.

28:01.483 --> 28:03.517
That doesn't mean that
Amy's in love with me,

28:03.551 --> 28:04.551
and even if she is,

28:04.586 --> 28:06.520
being in love doesn't
mean she'd ever want to be

28:06.554 --> 28:08.856
in a relationship with me again.
Well, let's go find out.

28:08.890 --> 28:10.291
I want to go say goodnight to John.

28:10.325 --> 28:12.626
You go with me. You talk to Amy.

28:12.661 --> 28:16.263
Uh, no, now's really not a good time,

28:16.298 --> 28:18.465
and, besides, that's something
I should do on my own.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.567
Well, you haven't,
and this is as good a time as any,

28:20.602 --> 28:22.269
so let's go.

28:38.605 --> 28:41.707
Jack, the first thing we want you to know

28:41.742 --> 28:44.076
is that we love you very, very much.

28:44.111 --> 28:47.146
And secondly, we would
never make a huge decision

28:47.181 --> 28:50.016
like this without involving you
because we do love you,

28:50.050 --> 28:51.818
and we're a family,

28:51.852 --> 28:54.153
and families communicate with each other,

28:54.188 --> 28:57.089
and that's what we're here to do.

28:57.124 --> 28:58.724
Huh?

29:00.027 --> 29:03.062
-We have to talk.
-Do we have to? Can it wait?

29:03.096 --> 29:06.699
No, it can't wait.
Madison and I got into a fight,

29:06.733 --> 29:09.502
and I just don't really
feel like talking right now.

29:09.536 --> 29:11.671
I'm sure you two will enjoy making up later,

29:11.705 --> 29:12.905
but right now we need to talk to you.

29:12.940 --> 29:14.941
I told her I loved her for the first time,

29:14.975 --> 29:17.143
and she somehow thought that I
should also give her a gift.

29:17.177 --> 29:19.312
Well, I gave your mother
this necklace she's wearing

29:19.346 --> 29:21.113
first time I said "I love you" to her.

29:21.148 --> 29:24.684
And I get to tell people that every
time someone compliments me on it.

29:24.718 --> 29:27.086
Not that giving someone a gift is necessary.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.457
It's just romantic.
Girls like romance, Jack.

29:31.491 --> 29:33.125
I thought they like spontaneity.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.329
That, too. Jack,
we have something to tell you.

29:36.363 --> 29:38.998
And we hope you're going to be
as happy about it as we are.

29:39.032 --> 29:41.000
Oh, jeez, please don't tell
me you're having a baby.

29:41.034 --> 29:43.302
No. No.
No, we're not having a baby.

29:43.337 --> 29:45.905
Oh, good.
We're moving.

29:45.939 --> 29:49.242
We want to move, that is.
I like this place, but, all right.

29:49.276 --> 29:53.346
To Phoenix.
I've been asked to take over

29:53.380 --> 29:54.614
as the head of the philosophy department

29:54.648 --> 29:57.016
at my alma mater. It's quite an honor.

29:57.050 --> 30:00.586
And it means no church, not that I
haven't loved being part of the church.

30:00.621 --> 30:02.755
I just think I'd love being
part of the school even more.

30:02.789 --> 30:04.624
What is that, like, six hours from here?

30:04.658 --> 30:06.826
I'm going to have to drive six
hours back and forth to school?

30:06.860 --> 30:08.561
No, Jack, you wouldn't be able to do that.

30:08.595 --> 30:10.963
I can't miss my senior
year playing football.

30:10.998 --> 30:12.131
Of course not,

30:12.165 --> 30:13.900
and we want to drive back
for as many of your games

30:13.934 --> 30:17.370
as we possibly can.
So I'd be living here by myself?

30:17.404 --> 30:19.338
It's not our house. It's the church's house.

30:19.373 --> 30:22.208
Right. I forgot.
But we were wondering,

30:22.242 --> 30:24.143
is there any possibility

30:24.177 --> 30:26.212
you could stay with a friend
your senior year of high school?

30:26.246 --> 30:27.980
Yeah, sure. I have plenty of friends.

30:28.015 --> 30:29.548
Which friend would let you live with them?

30:29.583 --> 30:31.050
I don't know. I'll ask around.

30:31.084 --> 30:33.986
Jack, really, as much as we want to do this,

30:34.021 --> 30:36.756
we love you, and we would really miss you,

30:36.790 --> 30:39.959
and unless you can find the
right friend to stay with--

30:39.993 --> 30:41.928
Then I couldn't possibly take the job.

30:41.962 --> 30:44.630
Are you kidding?
Why would you pass it up?

30:44.665 --> 30:46.599
I'm going to be out of
school in a year anyway,

30:46.633 --> 30:49.168
and I'm telling you, finding a
place to hang out for a year

30:49.202 --> 30:51.737
won't be a problem.
Take the job.

30:51.772 --> 30:53.839
I don't want to mess up an
opportunity for you like that.

30:53.874 --> 30:55.207
Are you sure?

30:55.242 --> 30:58.477
Yeah. I'll start asking around tomorrow,
but take the job.

30:58.512 --> 31:01.147
I'll be fine. I swear.
I love you, son.

31:01.181 --> 31:02.415
Thank you. Thank you.

31:14.962 --> 31:18.965
Madison, hey. You were right,
and I was wrong,

31:18.999 --> 31:23.202
and I'm going to give you something
before I tell you I love you again.

31:23.236 --> 31:24.837
By the way, quick question.

31:24.871 --> 31:27.873
Do you think your mom and dad
would let me live over there?

31:33.246 --> 31:36.148
What are you doing here?
Came over to see John,

31:36.183 --> 31:37.450
and I brought Ben with me

31:37.484 --> 31:39.185
so he and Amy could just
cut out all the drama

31:39.219 --> 31:41.087
and go back with each other.

31:41.121 --> 31:43.756
You didn't do that so you'd feel
free to go back to Adrian, did you?

31:43.790 --> 31:46.258
If I wanted to go back to Adrian,
I could just go back to Adrian.

31:46.293 --> 31:49.261
I don't want to go back to Adrian.
Because?

31:49.296 --> 31:51.664
Because Ben did what he did with Adrian

31:51.698 --> 31:54.367
because he was hurt and confused,

31:54.401 --> 31:58.004
but Adrian did what she did with Ben
because she wanted to hurt me

31:58.038 --> 31:59.572
and hurt Amy,

31:59.606 --> 32:01.574
and I've had a lifetime
of people hurting me,

32:01.608 --> 32:02.875
and I don't want that anymore.

32:02.909 --> 32:04.810
Sounds like you've given
this a lot of thought.

32:04.845 --> 32:07.847
If you're asking if I've been
talking about that in therapy,

32:07.881 --> 32:09.048
then, yes, I have.

32:09.082 --> 32:14.420
So without Adrian, what are
you doing for companionship?

32:14.454 --> 32:16.322
I don't have to have companionship.

32:16.356 --> 32:17.823
Since when?

32:17.858 --> 32:21.360
I didn't say I didn't have companionship.
I said I don't have to have it.

32:21.395 --> 32:24.163
Then so why do you?
Still figuring that out.

32:24.197 --> 32:26.866
I mean, I know I don't
have to have a companion

32:26.900 --> 32:29.068
or companions, but I still want to.

32:29.102 --> 32:33.506
And so you do have a
companion or companions.

32:33.540 --> 32:36.308
I said I do, okay?

32:36.343 --> 32:38.911
Can we change the subject?
You're too young to talk about this.

32:38.945 --> 32:42.114
Oh, please, I'm the same age as
Amy when you met her at band camp.

32:42.149 --> 32:43.616
Well, you do seem older than that.

32:43.650 --> 32:45.317
And wiser.

32:45.352 --> 32:49.622
So how are things with that guy?
You know his name. Grant.

32:52.426 --> 32:54.126
Things are fine.

32:54.161 --> 32:58.164
Is he your companion? He might be.
Want some advice? No.

32:58.198 --> 33:00.800
I'm going to give it to you anyway.
Don't have sex in high school.

33:00.834 --> 33:05.137
Oh, you mean, like you and
Amy and Adrian and Grace

33:05.172 --> 33:09.375
and Ben and Jack and Madison?
Yeah, don't be like everybody else.

33:09.409 --> 33:11.077
I'm not. I hope not.

33:11.111 --> 33:14.313
And why is that? I'm just going
to leave it at that, all right?

33:14.347 --> 33:20.152
All right.

33:20.187 --> 33:23.622
John was so happy to see you.
Yeah, it's good seeing him.

33:23.657 --> 33:28.928
I love that little guy.
Really glad you came over.

33:28.962 --> 33:31.597
Me, too.
I got your message.

33:31.631 --> 33:34.700
Oh, yeah, I did leave a message, didn't I.

33:34.734 --> 33:38.104
So you remember?
I remember. I'm--

33:38.138 --> 33:42.975
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I just kind of scared myself.

33:44.311 --> 33:45.845
I do love you, Amy.

33:45.879 --> 33:50.216
I really do, but we've been
back and forth so much,

33:50.250 --> 33:52.418
how do we make this work?

33:52.452 --> 33:54.320
How do you even start to
forgive me for Adrian?

33:54.354 --> 33:57.089
Adrian and Grace and Maria and--

33:57.124 --> 34:00.826
I... get your point.

34:02.095 --> 34:05.531
It's not just Adrian. It's pretty 
much the last two years.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.967
It's been really painful for both of us.

34:08.001 --> 34:13.339
Yeah, it has. Why continue
to make it painful?

34:13.373 --> 34:17.109
Why not just forget everything
but how much we loved each other,

34:17.143 --> 34:23.014
how much we still do?
At least I hope we still do.

34:27.621 --> 34:29.355
I swear to you, Amy Juergens,

34:29.389 --> 34:31.623
I will never do anything again to hurt you.

34:36.963 --> 34:40.032
I will never do anything again to hurt you.

34:40.065 --> 34:41.967
I love you.

34:46.406 --> 34:49.641
And I love you.
But you know that.

34:51.811 --> 34:54.746
Yeah, still have your message on my phone.

34:57.851 --> 35:01.086
All right, let's go. Wait. Thank you, Ricky.

35:01.121 --> 35:02.755
No problem. I owe you.

35:08.228 --> 35:10.863
I'll call you.
I hope so.

35:24.055 --> 35:28.759
Live here?
You want Jack to live here?

35:28.793 --> 35:32.396
Why not? Why not?
You know why not.

35:32.430 --> 35:36.467
No, I don't.
Why not?

35:36.501 --> 35:39.703
Well, I guess, uh,
there's no reason why not.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.306
Are you kidding? Yes, there is.
There are many reasons.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.508
Well, he loves me.
There's one reason right there.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.742
Did he give you something?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.478
Well, no, but he's going
to get me something.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.480
What kind of idiot parents would let

35:49.514 --> 35:51.915
a kid stay with another
family for a whole year?

35:51.950 --> 35:55.552
His dad is a minister.
Of a church? Yes.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.255
I mean, well, I thought you
said he was teaching philosophy.

35:58.289 --> 36:01.391
He's going to if-
if Jack can find a place to live,

36:01.426 --> 36:03.427
and I'm his first choice.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.629
Sorry, Madison, it's not going to happen.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.763
It's my room.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.465
You thought that he'd live in your room?

36:08.500 --> 36:11.168
Well, it's better than doing drugs.
That's your argument,

36:11.202 --> 36:12.369
that your boyfriend should live in your room

36:12.403 --> 36:13.637
because it's better than doing drugs?

36:13.671 --> 36:15.205
We're going to be at
school most of the time.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.273
We would just be sleeping here.

36:16.307 --> 36:22.813
No.
Oh, Madison--

36:25.350 --> 36:28.118
I can't help you here. Sorry.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.189
Great.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.630
Hey, what are you doing?
You're not going to bed, are you?

36:39.664 --> 36:41.365
Well, I was just going to
read a little bit first.

36:41.399 --> 36:43.600
Read? Don't read. Let's go for a run.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.537
A run?
What's going on?

36:46.571 --> 36:49.506
I'm trying to talk Ashley
into going for a run with me.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.975
You know, if you're going to be on
the track team, you need to train,

36:52.010 --> 36:53.844
and I'm going to train with you.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.514
In fact I'm going to be spending lots
and lots of time with you, Ashley.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.851
You know why? Because I love you,
and I've been so distracted

37:00.885 --> 37:02.619
by everyone else in this family lately--

37:02.654 --> 37:04.922
by your dad, by Amy, by Robbie and John--

37:04.956 --> 37:08.759
at I haven't made the time for you,
and I'm going to make time for you

37:08.793 --> 37:12.863
whether it's going to your meets
or running or working out

37:12.897 --> 37:16.400
or just hanging out and talking.
I'm on the pill.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.635
What?
You're on the pill?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.404
I told you I do not want you on the pill.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.638
No, you didn't.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.808
You two sneaked off to go to the doctor
to get Ashley what she wanted

37:24.842 --> 37:29.012
because of the way that I reacted.
Okay, maybe I reacted a little strongly.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.747
Maybe I should have made the time

37:30.782 --> 37:33.350
to corner you yesterday
to talk about this with Ashley

37:33.384 --> 37:36.086
because we really need to talk about this.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.290
What am I missing?
Ashley isn't on the track team.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.225
No kidding.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.495
Was I right? Were they off to the
doctor's office getting Ashley the pill?

37:46.464 --> 37:48.065
You knew? I'm not an idiot.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.334
Yes, you are. All right, knock it off.

37:50.368 --> 37:55.872
My head still hurts from being de-plugged,
and if anyone's to blame for this, it's me,

37:55.907 --> 37:57.274
and a little you.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.610
You couldn't just go for a run?
You have to commit to these things.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.381
Okay, we were wrong to do what we did,

38:04.415 --> 38:05.949
me especially,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.785
but I think that girls need to make
these decisions for themselves.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.121
Girls need guidance in
making these decisions.

38:11.155 --> 38:14.024
Uh, I don't like being
referred to as a girl.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.258
I have a 1-year-old son, you know.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.593
Yeah, we know.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.762
I know anyway, and I don't
want a baby. Hence the pills.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.030
Are you having sex?

38:20.064 --> 38:23.367
No, and I don't plan on
having sex in high school,

38:23.401 --> 38:27.070
but we all know that plans can change,
and if for any reason my plan fails,

38:27.105 --> 38:31.241
I want to have a backup plan.
You know, I want to be protected.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.176
Okay. Okay?

38:33.211 --> 38:36.013
It's okay with you if she's on the
pill if that's her backup plan?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.215
Obviously it's okay with
her if you are on the pill.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.351
Why can't I be on the pill
if you're on the pill?

38:43.221 --> 38:46.523
You knew that, right?
No, they didn't know that, so thanks.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.624
How did you know that?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.026
When I was getting the prescription filled,

38:49.060 --> 38:50.227
there was a little mix-up

38:50.261 --> 38:51.928
because Amy's name was
already in the computer

38:51.963 --> 38:53.230
for a similar prescription.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.666
I should sue that pharmacy.
So you're on the pill?

38:55.700 --> 38:57.934
Didn't you learn anything
from having a baby at 15?

38:57.969 --> 39:01.171
You'd have sex again?
I don't know, but if I do-- Don't.

39:01.205 --> 39:04.074
I thought it was up to girls to
make decisions for ourselves,

39:04.108 --> 39:06.343
and you know what?
You and Mom and Ashley

39:06.377 --> 39:07.811
never let me forget that I made a mistake,

39:07.845 --> 39:08.979
and I'm tired of it.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.382
The only person who really loves me is Ben.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.088
Okay, we're going to talk
about this more tomorrow

39:18.122 --> 39:20.123
and the next day and the day after that

39:20.158 --> 39:22.592
because we have to start
talking and keep talking,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.628
or this family is just going to fall apart.

39:26.130 --> 39:29.166
Didn't it already fall apart?
I thought it was on the mend.

39:33.371 --> 39:39.443
We just got a massage.
Mm, it was deep tissue.

39:39.477 --> 39:42.446
Everything okay over there?
Better than okay.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.183
I just got back from Amy's.
No kidding.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.786
He just got home from Amy's.
Oh, we love little Amy.

39:49.821 --> 39:54.224
-Dad, I really think this time is it.
-Listen to me, Take it slowly.

39:54.258 --> 39:56.960
You got plenty of time.
Rest of your lives,

39:56.994 --> 39:59.963
just like me and my bride here.
You think?

39:59.997 --> 40:01.631
You think that some day
Amy and I will get married

40:01.666 --> 40:03.300
and be as happy as you and Betty?

40:03.334 --> 40:05.902
I don't think anybody will ever
be as happy as Betty and me--

40:05.937 --> 40:08.238
...but it'll give you
something to shoot for, kid.

40:09.474 --> 40:14.044
Yeah, it will.
Okay, good night.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.387
Oh, good, you're up.
Took one day off,

40:24.422 --> 40:26.623
and now it's like I'm a
week behind with my cases.

40:26.657 --> 40:29.459
How are you?
Good. How are you?

40:29.494 --> 40:31.194
How's the married life this time around?

40:31.229 --> 40:33.597
Lonely.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.432
I wish your mom didn't
have to travel so much.

40:35.466 --> 40:40.270
I've been saying that my whole life.
Well, I love your mom very much, Adrian,

40:40.304 --> 40:43.473
and you, too.
I love you.

40:43.508 --> 40:47.277
You know, I'm really happy
you decided to track me down.

40:47.311 --> 40:50.213
You changed my life
for the better.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.882
We wouldn't be a family if not for you.

40:51.916 --> 40:56.253
Oh, thanks, Dad.
You're welcome.

40:56.287 --> 41:05.462
Good night. Good night, Adrian.
Is everything okay?

41:05.496 --> 41:08.732
Yeah, everything's fine.
Are you and Ricky--

41:08.766 --> 41:13.904
No, we're not even speaking,
but that's okay.

41:13.938 --> 41:18.175
Everything that happened with
Ben was a good lesson for me.

41:18.209 --> 41:22.813
Casual sex is really not all that casual.
Next time I have sex,

41:22.847 --> 41:27.050
I want it to be with a guy that I love,
a guy that means something to me.

41:27.084 --> 41:30.420
That's what I wanted in the first place.
I just got off on the wrong track,

41:30.454 --> 41:34.090
so I'm going to do things
differently from now on.

41:34.125 --> 41:38.361
I like what I'm hearing,
but change isn't easy,

41:38.396 --> 41:40.463
so if you need some help or want to talk,

41:40.498 --> 41:44.768
I'm there for you, Adrian...
Always. Thanks.
