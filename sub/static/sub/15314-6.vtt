00:09.790 --> 00:12.773
Ah! The Great Pact of Nottingham.

00:12.808 --> 00:15.757
All drawn up and ready for signature?

00:15.792 --> 00:18.173
Safe in your quarters?

00:18.208 --> 00:20.995
Good, good.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.430
And you've told
nobody about your work?

00:23.465 --> 00:25.455
The scribe is mute, my Lord.

00:25.490 --> 00:29.079
Mute? Are we sure?

00:31.410 --> 00:33.015
Oh, look! Look!

00:33.050 --> 00:37.077
The Black Knights. On their
way to the castle to sign the pact!

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

00:46.490 --> 00:48.560
Now we're sure.

01:03.470 --> 01:05.438
Is this what you're looking for?

01:06.990 --> 01:12.257
Your blood money. Betray your
friends for a few measly pennies.

01:12.292 --> 01:14.673
Traitor! Look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:14.708 --> 01:16.355
I'm really sorry...

01:16.390 --> 01:18.972
Really... I never wanted...

01:19.007 --> 01:20.414
HORSES APPROACH

01:40.050 --> 01:41.695
Is that who I think it was?

01:41.730 --> 01:45.200
The Black Knights, heading for
Nottingham. What are they up to?

01:46.130 --> 01:47.535
I'm going in.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.754
What about Allan? Forget him.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.320
He's dead to us.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.375
Meet back at the camp in one hour.

01:55.410 --> 01:58.937
Well, you can't just decide
to go like this and go!

01:58.972 --> 02:01.555
Without planning... without us!

02:01.590 --> 02:04.138
Yes, I can! It's the Black Knights!

02:07.910 --> 02:13.018
Why does he do this? Why does he
always, always do this?

02:58.850 --> 03:01.421
What are these in aid of, Sir Guy?

03:01.910 --> 03:04.561
A bit of colour for you.

03:05.810 --> 03:09.473
I was wondering if you would
accompany me to the celebrations today.

03:09.508 --> 03:12.121
What are we celebrating? The King's
birthday.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.912
What are we really celebrating?

03:16.550 --> 03:18.370
Does it matter?

03:21.570 --> 03:24.095
It's the signing
of an important document.

03:24.130 --> 03:27.495
Something tells me it is a
document which I won't approve of.

03:27.530 --> 03:32.695
Well, Marian, you should approve, because
this document brings me closer to real power.

03:32.730 --> 03:35.659
And that, in turn, benefits you.

03:35.694 --> 03:38.050
COULD benefit you...

03:38.085 --> 03:39.540
in time.

03:42.190 --> 03:45.353
Meanwhile, there's a
pretty dress in it for you.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.515
Am I so easily won?

03:47.550 --> 03:50.553
You must be the least
easily won woman in England.

03:52.430 --> 03:57.777
Well, if that's my reputation, then perhaps
nobody will mind if I do not attend...

03:57.812 --> 04:01.911
Choose a dress. Guy...

04:07.090 --> 04:08.684
What are you doing here?

04:08.719 --> 04:10.235
Just dropping in on you.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.635
So, the Black Knights
are assembling.

04:13.670 --> 04:18.118
Did you hear Gisborne? They're
signing an important document.

04:18.153 --> 04:20.839
Who died? The Sheriff's scribe.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.994
Fell from the battlements.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.355
Outlived his usefulness. What?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.635
Dead scribes, Black Knights...

04:27.670 --> 04:30.992
Something tells me we have to find
this document.

04:44.810 --> 04:49.110
Not being funny... your guards.
Useless!

04:54.610 --> 04:56.817
You need smarter people on your team.

04:56.852 --> 04:57.970
And that's you, is it?

04:58.005 --> 04:59.895
Well...

04:59.930 --> 05:01.591
Hood found you out?

05:04.050 --> 05:05.278
Maybe.

05:06.330 --> 05:07.752
Don't insult me.

05:12.290 --> 05:14.155
All right. I need your help.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.574
I've lost everything cos I
helped you, so you owe me.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.470
I owe you nothing.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.578
I paid you.

05:24.410 --> 05:25.980
Take me on, Guy, come on.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.074
You won't regret it.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.841
Go and get one of my
servants to give you some food.

05:36.330 --> 05:39.777
Ah, nice. Where you off to, then?

05:41.870 --> 05:46.091
Get yourself cleaned up.
Come and find me at the castle.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.531
This is it. The scribe's room.

06:12.610 --> 06:17.593
...Better get a move on. Down at
the front gate again on guard...

06:24.170 --> 06:26.934
Robin. This isn't the time...

06:29.970 --> 06:31.015
Will that work?

06:31.050 --> 06:36.420
Trust me, I've done this before.
With which girl's hairpin?

06:36.455 --> 06:39.072
LOCK CLICKS

06:48.310 --> 06:50.938
"The Great Pact of Nottingham.

06:52.290 --> 06:56.340
"We, the undersigned, by the affixing
of our seals of office and nobility,

06:56.375 --> 06:59.375
"hereby undertake to remove
King Richard from the throne.

06:59.410 --> 07:04.211
"By his lasting absence, he demonstrates his
scant regard for the welfare of his subjects. "

07:04.246 --> 07:05.255
This is outrageous!

07:05.290 --> 07:11.058
"We further undertake to replace the said Richard
with his brother, John, Prince of the realm. "

07:11.093 --> 07:14.372
The Sheriff is making the Black
Knights sign their allegiance.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.179
This is a traitors' charter.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.255
Looks like the Sheriff
has made some new friends.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.514
Buckingham, Spencer...

07:22.549 --> 07:24.815
Winchester?

07:24.850 --> 07:27.774
Surely not.
He's an old friend of my father.

07:29.350 --> 07:30.715
DOOR SLAMS

07:30.750 --> 07:35.972
When the Pact is signed, there
can be no going back for our friends.

07:36.030 --> 07:39.614
And enjoy this party.

08:06.430 --> 08:07.897
Nobody here.

08:16.410 --> 08:18.135
Look at this.

08:18.170 --> 08:20.957
The colour,
the detail, the tone texture.

08:20.992 --> 08:23.339
This man was a true artist.

08:25.430 --> 08:28.115
I'm sorry I killed him, though.

08:28.150 --> 08:29.793
A clue...

08:29.828 --> 08:31.200
No.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.518
Door.

08:42.549 --> 08:43.755
Go, go...

08:43.789 --> 08:48.033
I cannot believe Winchester would
willingly be involved in this revolt.

08:48.068 --> 08:49.995
Winchester controls the south coast.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.175
The Sheriff wants to intercept the
King's landing. But Winchester?!

08:54.210 --> 08:58.321
I've known him since we were boys.
The Sheriff must have got to him.

08:58.356 --> 09:03.395
Good. Good? If the Sheriff
can get to him, then so can I.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.595
Edward, I'll be back.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.440
And when I get back, I
will get you out of this place.

09:09.310 --> 09:10.937
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

09:11.030 --> 09:15.433
What should I do?
Be meek and obedient, my child.

09:15.468 --> 09:18.355
Until I know more.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.119
Jailer, confession's over.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.796
Why have we stopped?

09:35.410 --> 09:37.037
Oh. Move it!

09:39.990 --> 09:43.892
My Lord Winchester, I'm a friend.
I know you are coming to Nottingham

09:43.927 --> 09:47.794
to sign the Sheriff's pact. I don't
know what you're talking about.

09:48.450 --> 09:50.055
My name is Robin Hood.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.755
We haven't got time for games.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.180
Robin! Forgive me, I... have to
be careful.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.735
We have a mutual friend.

09:56.770 --> 10:01.560
Sir Edward, the former Sheriff of Nottingham.
Edward, how is he? In the Sheriff's dungeons.

10:01.595 --> 10:05.896
Good God. What can we do?
First, we need to kill this pact.

10:05.931 --> 10:09.006
Spencer and Buckingham
are signing under duress, too.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.035
Lf, at the moment of signing, you
were to refuse,

10:12.070 --> 10:16.275
the Black Knights would lose faith and
the Sheriff's pact would be history.

10:16.310 --> 10:21.191
That's dangerous. The Sheriff would turn his men
on me. That's where I come in, you need support.

10:22.710 --> 10:24.595
Forgive me. I am a peace-loving man.

10:24.630 --> 10:27.770
I want only stability and
the Sheriff is offering me that...

10:27.805 --> 10:29.035
What they don't know...

10:29.070 --> 10:31.795
is that I've already sent a
messenger to the King.

10:31.830 --> 10:35.635
Roger of Stoke. By now, the King
will already know about this plot.

10:35.670 --> 10:39.834
When he returns to England, the first
thing he will do is crush the Black Knights.

10:41.510 --> 10:46.595
If you love peace, do anything,
but do not sign the Sheriff's pact.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.639
Ahhh... Count me in.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.115
Right, lads, work to do.

11:01.150 --> 11:04.375
We're going to the castle. Why?

11:04.410 --> 11:07.875
Why? To save England,
Marian and her father.

11:07.910 --> 11:12.620
They're hosting a celebration for the King's
birthday. Except it's really a celebration

11:12.655 --> 11:15.155
for the Black Knights
signing the pact.

11:15.190 --> 11:18.956
Will, you need to find us a way
of getting into this party.

11:18.991 --> 11:20.835
I've already done it. How?

11:20.870 --> 11:24.160
The castle announced
this party weeks ago.

11:24.195 --> 11:27.450
Put out a call
for entertainers and players.

11:27.485 --> 11:33.138
And it gave me an idea.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.084
It's a recurve bow!

11:39.119 --> 11:42.038
Djaq? It's a flute.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.075
What does this do? Much, don't!

11:50.150 --> 11:51.975
Sorry!

11:52.010 --> 11:53.614
This is for you.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.255
Will, you're a genius!

11:58.290 --> 12:00.451
And a magician. That's brilliant.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.119
You crafty craftsman!

12:03.154 --> 12:05.753
What about me? Ah.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.917
These are for you.

12:10.010 --> 12:12.850
Bells? What do they do?

12:12.885 --> 12:15.690
Oh, they're just bells.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.316
Thanks.

12:23.530 --> 12:27.000
FANFARE PLAYS

12:30.423 --> 12:31.510
Delighted...

12:31.545 --> 12:33.752
to welcome Harold of Winchester...

12:33.787 --> 12:36.995
to join our celebrations
for the King's birthday.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.435
Thank you, Marian.

12:39.674 --> 12:43.041
We sign in one hour. Marvellous.

12:43.076 --> 12:45.165
I was ungrateful earlier.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.408
I'm sorry. I was over-bearing.

12:48.443 --> 12:50.891
Can I have word
in private with you first?

12:50.926 --> 12:53.568
I'd like to talk to your
predecessor, if I may.

12:53.603 --> 12:56.572
Yes, well, Sir Edward is,
how shall I put it, indisposed.

12:56.607 --> 12:59.595
In what way? He's in the dungeons.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.548
No, really? He's loyal to the King.

13:02.583 --> 13:06.008
And also, a right royal
pain in the derriere.

13:06.043 --> 13:12.243
I'd still like to talk to him, if you have
no objections. Yes, well, it can be arranged.

13:12.278 --> 13:15.246
Gisborne will show you to
your quarters.

13:15.763 --> 13:17.128
Keep an eye on him.

13:18.243 --> 13:21.132
This way, my Lord.

13:24.903 --> 13:26.688
My Lord?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.408
This way. Ah... yes.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.955
Reason for visit?

13:35.990 --> 13:37.468
Security check.

13:37.503 --> 13:40.210
No knives, no weapons in the castle.

13:41.643 --> 13:44.692
We're the band, the minstrels.

13:54.063 --> 13:55.883
Will. Allan! Much.

14:00.643 --> 14:04.306
I'm Sir Guy's man.
Can you let me pass? In you go.

14:07.023 --> 14:08.988
What's he doing here?

14:09.023 --> 14:11.332
He's being "Sir Guy's Man".

14:11.367 --> 14:12.428
Unbelievable.

14:12.463 --> 14:15.068
Did you see what he was wearing?!
Unbelievable.

14:15.103 --> 14:16.644
Whose is this?

14:21.143 --> 14:22.849
I said, whose is this?

14:24.863 --> 14:26.785
It's mine.

14:29.543 --> 14:31.708
A bit's come off, sorry...

14:31.743 --> 14:35.247
That's all right. I'm good with wood.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.147
Er, bells, mate.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.507
You know what to do. I'm off
to see Winchester. Wait here.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.984
Oh! Cake.

15:21.423 --> 15:23.348
What?

15:23.383 --> 15:26.508
Had to put something on, didn't I?

15:26.543 --> 15:29.831
I suppose you want me to introduce
you to the Sheriff now, do you?

15:31.183 --> 15:34.550
Yeah. Wait through there.

15:39.723 --> 15:42.788
Go in there and get yourselves ready.

15:42.823 --> 15:46.907
Er... Of course,
we'll go in there and... tune up.

15:50.863 --> 15:53.832
We can't possibly go in there.
Allan. Why not?

15:54.663 --> 15:57.803
We, er, never share dressing rooms.

15:57.838 --> 16:00.428
You're already dressed.

16:00.463 --> 16:03.910
It's the principle. We're artists.

16:06.983 --> 16:08.427
He's the drummer.

16:15.823 --> 16:19.768
My men are safely in the castle. I
heard you could walk through walls.

16:19.803 --> 16:25.014
Your meeting will take place in the War Room. I'll
be there. It will be strictly Black Knights only.

16:25.049 --> 16:27.428
Then I shall be a Black Knight.
Confident.

16:27.463 --> 16:31.368
Determined. My men will be
waiting outside the War Room.

16:31.403 --> 16:36.511
When you've said your piece, I'll cover for you
and you run. My men will secure your safe exit.

16:36.546 --> 16:38.388
Thank you. What about you?

16:38.423 --> 16:41.870
Well, I can walk through walls.
Remember?

16:41.905 --> 16:43.683
Good luck. You too.

16:43.718 --> 16:45.207
And thank you.

16:51.683 --> 16:58.589
Tell me something. What do you know about a messenger
sent by Robin Hood to the King, telling of our plans?

16:58.624 --> 17:00.088
Roger of Stoke?

17:00.123 --> 17:01.788
Don't worry about him.

17:01.823 --> 17:04.290
He got lost en route. Well done.

17:05.823 --> 17:09.031
If I may be allowed
to speak to Sir Edward in private?

17:12.143 --> 17:13.348
Edward.

17:13.383 --> 17:15.284
Harry! My old friend.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.185
What has happened to you?

17:17.221 --> 17:19.628
Sit down.

17:21.542 --> 17:26.028
I've had a visit
from a friend of yours.

17:26.063 --> 17:32.263
Robin. Excellent. He advised me not
to back the wrong horse.

17:32.298 --> 17:35.488
But then, I look where
you've ended up... Harry?

17:35.523 --> 17:39.248
I could back you, Edward. And end
up stuck in a cell with vermin.

17:39.283 --> 17:42.973
Or I could back the Sheriff and
just get richer and more powerful.

17:43.008 --> 17:45.108
Rats or riches?

17:45.143 --> 17:46.747
It's a tough choice.

17:46.782 --> 17:48.368
Harry.

17:48.403 --> 17:51.484
You cannot sign the pact.
Oh, I will sign the pact.

17:51.519 --> 17:54.565
You are mad if you think
you can trust the Sheriff.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.608
Trust? Oh, no,

17:56.643 --> 17:59.885
I don't trust anyone.
You taught me that,

17:59.920 --> 18:02.010
when you stole the woman I loved.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.415
Jailer?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.785
Kate?!

18:06.003 --> 18:08.312
She chose me, Harold.
I didn't steal her.

18:08.347 --> 18:09.848
I was just thinking of her.

18:09.883 --> 18:13.910
I thought I saw her outside just now.
A young woman, the very image of Kate...

18:15.883 --> 18:17.808
She's your daughter!

18:17.843 --> 18:21.324
Of course! She's her mother's
double.

18:21.359 --> 18:23.328
Well done, Edward.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.423
We wouldn't want her inheriting
your looks, now, would we?

18:29.123 --> 18:31.307
Oh, oh, oh...

18:31.883 --> 18:33.928
I've just had an idea.

18:33.963 --> 18:39.993
If I couldn't have the mother...
What's her name, hmmm?

18:40.028 --> 18:42.168
Your little precious pea? No!

18:42.203 --> 18:44.048
No? That's not her name, now is it?

18:44.083 --> 18:48.372
No! Harry, she's got nothing
to do with this. Please!

18:48.407 --> 18:50.206
I don't think he likes me any more.

18:51.123 --> 18:53.045
Please!

19:03.723 --> 19:07.932
Harry... you wanted a word?

19:10.283 --> 19:12.171
What was the word?

19:13.843 --> 19:16.448
Sussex. Sussex?

19:16.483 --> 19:19.048
Sussex.

19:20.363 --> 19:21.688
Sussex.

19:21.723 --> 19:24.624
I want it. Sussex?

19:25.583 --> 19:28.968
I hold the key to the success of
your plan. It's come to my attention

19:29.003 --> 19:33.884
that Buckingham and Spencer are nervous. They'll
do as they're told. Not if they see me falter.

19:33.919 --> 19:38.206
Not if they think you don't have access to
where King Richard is most likely to land.

19:38.241 --> 19:41.889
I have therefore decided that my
price for helping you is Sussex. Oh...

19:41.924 --> 19:44.488
and some of Surrey.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.450
Harry...

19:54.283 --> 19:56.934
Very good, very good.
Almost had me there.

19:56.969 --> 19:57.928
No, I'm serious.

19:57.963 --> 20:02.491
If you want this pact signed, it will cost
you Sussex. And some of Surrey. Surrey...

20:02.526 --> 20:06.567
And the girl. What girl?
Er... Marian. No! Shut up.

20:06.602 --> 20:09.805
You still gain Warwick, Lincoln
and Cambridge.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.048
And... some of Surrey.

20:12.083 --> 20:16.784
Oh, and I have something to
offer you. A little bonus.

20:16.819 --> 20:21.485
A little... sweetener. Still, if
you're not playing...

20:45.683 --> 20:49.084
You get Sussex.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.409
I keep Surrey.

20:53.943 --> 20:57.128
Oh, you drive a hard bargain.

20:58.743 --> 21:01.405
It's a deal. Marian stays.
Not negotiable, sorry.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.068
Personal thing. I won't bore you
with the details.

21:04.103 --> 21:07.567
The girl and Sussex
and then you sign?

21:08.943 --> 21:11.468
Pleasure doing business with you.
My Lord...

21:11.503 --> 21:13.308
Harry? Hmm?

21:13.343 --> 21:16.653
What was the sweetener? Later.

21:16.688 --> 21:19.453
You'll like it.

21:22.983 --> 21:26.043
You cannot give him Marian!
I have lost Sussex!

21:26.078 --> 21:27.628
SUSSEX!

21:27.663 --> 21:30.268
And all you can do
is bleat about a girl!

21:30.303 --> 21:32.268
I want a hanging!

21:32.303 --> 21:36.091
What? Find me somebody to hang.
I want to see somebody twitch.

21:36.823 --> 21:39.668
My Lord, this man said you
were going to see him. Not now!

21:39.703 --> 21:43.753
You'll do. For what? Hang him. What?!
No, this man works for me. So?

21:43.788 --> 21:47.308
So, he was my spy in Hood's camp.
Was? Hood found him out.

21:47.343 --> 21:52.588
Served his purpose then, hasn't he? He might still
prove useful. You're not listening to me, Gisborne!

21:52.623 --> 21:56.110
Find that lady leper friend and take
her to see Lord Winchester.

21:56.145 --> 21:59.231
Then bring him before me with a
hood over his head!

21:59.266 --> 22:01.145
Hang on a minute. I'm on your team
now!

22:01.180 --> 22:03.771
And I can help, honest. Guy!

22:03.823 --> 22:07.350
Lah... di-dah di-dah.

22:09.103 --> 22:10.508
Guy?

22:10.543 --> 22:14.593
Hang on, let me say something here,
right? Guy! Come on, you can't be serious.

22:14.628 --> 22:16.551
Just take him away. What?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.474
Guy, what are you doing?

22:29.983 --> 22:31.393
Psst! I'm not hungry.

22:33.203 --> 22:37.068
Robin, thank heavens... Shhhh. I
haven't got much time.

22:37.103 --> 22:41.403
The Sheriff is about to have his meeting.
And Winchester is going to refuse to sign.

22:41.438 --> 22:43.388
There'll be absolute chaos.

22:43.423 --> 22:46.233
And in that chaos, I intend to come
down and get you out.

22:48.763 --> 22:52.233
What? Winchester is going to sign.

22:52.268 --> 22:55.112
He's a traitor. A traitor?

22:56.403 --> 22:58.064
And he wants Marian.

22:59.263 --> 23:01.248
Marian? What for?

23:01.283 --> 23:04.703
Revenge. Against me. What?

23:04.738 --> 23:08.088
He thinks I took his woman.

23:08.123 --> 23:11.263
So he's going to take my daughter.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.071
Robin?

23:18.423 --> 23:19.548
Then I have no choice.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.905
What? What are you going to do?

23:25.143 --> 23:26.667
God speed, Edward.

23:29.903 --> 23:35.488
Guy, at least do me the courtesy of knocking...
Get your possessions. You're leaving.

23:35.523 --> 23:41.143
What? Now! Why? Winchester's made a deal with
the Sheriff, you've become part of a negotiation.

23:41.178 --> 23:44.670
Pardon? Winchester wants you.

23:47.143 --> 23:49.088
Tell him he can't have me.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.868
The Sheriff has agreed.
I cannot protect you.

23:51.903 --> 23:57.330
Listen to me. You have to run. Now. I can't!
My father... I will take care of your father.

23:57.365 --> 24:01.066
I cannot leave him. Why do you always
resist? I'm attempting to help you.

24:01.101 --> 24:03.128
I know, I can see
that and I'm grateful.

24:03.163 --> 24:06.394
If the Sheriff knew I was doing
this, my life would be in danger.

24:06.429 --> 24:08.112
Why do you work for him?

24:10.323 --> 24:12.788
I have nobody. So you choose him?

24:12.823 --> 24:15.826
So I choose power. He is my
route to position, standing.

24:15.861 --> 24:17.777
He is mad, you know that.

24:17.812 --> 24:19.648
No. He's single-minded.

24:19.683 --> 24:23.392
He does not allow... distractions
to divert him from his course.

24:23.427 --> 24:25.931
Distractions? Like a little
humanity?

24:25.966 --> 24:27.754
Humanity is weakness.

24:27.789 --> 24:29.543
You don't believe that.

24:31.443 --> 24:33.024
You must leave this place.

24:34.523 --> 24:36.428
This money will secure your passage.

24:36.463 --> 24:40.103
I have instructed a man on
the west gate to let you out.

24:42.203 --> 24:44.546
Marian.

24:47.643 --> 24:49.463
Good luck.

24:51.003 --> 24:54.427
Go! Now!

24:56.083 --> 24:57.607
Excellent.

25:00.723 --> 25:04.170
Taking the lady to see her new lord?

25:04.205 --> 25:07.143
My Lord...

25:07.923 --> 25:15.728
As my lieutenant, Gisborne, you
sit at the right hand of the father.

25:15.763 --> 25:21.093
You will share in the fruits
of OUR labour.

25:21.128 --> 25:26.487
You will be a god amongst men.

25:28.003 --> 25:32.906
As long as I can trust you.

25:37.403 --> 25:41.806
Take Lady Marian to Winchester.

25:51.323 --> 25:53.768
This? Oh, well...

25:53.803 --> 25:56.168
Tunisian, actually.

25:56.203 --> 25:59.013
Yeah, we tour all over the place,

25:59.048 --> 26:01.790
London, Lincoln, er... Hull.

26:01.825 --> 26:03.171
Right, come on.

26:03.643 --> 26:08.205
We're in the middle of something here. We
have to go warn Marian. Now, come on! Marian?

26:34.203 --> 26:37.923
Guy? Marian...

26:40.883 --> 26:43.363
I'm sorry.

26:46.283 --> 26:48.716
Sheriff's instructions.

26:48.751 --> 26:51.108
What? Get off me. Guy!

26:51.143 --> 26:54.965
Get off me, get off me! Guy!

26:56.763 --> 26:59.004
KNOCK AT DOOR

26:59.039 --> 27:00.971
Enter.

27:02.323 --> 27:03.968
Ah, the icing on my cake!

27:04.003 --> 27:08.167
Daddy's little girl.
I will not be treated like this.

27:08.202 --> 27:09.648
You're quite right.

27:09.683 --> 27:14.068
These handcuffs and leg irons, could
they be made a little tighter?

27:14.103 --> 27:18.767
How dare you?! Oh, gag her for God's sake. She's
pretty till she talks. To business. Come on!

27:36.183 --> 27:38.163
She's not here. What's the problem?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.108
I wanted to talk to her before...

27:40.143 --> 27:45.831
Before what? What do we have
to warn her about?

27:49.963 --> 27:51.965
Robin! Much...

27:58.563 --> 28:00.308
"My dearest Marian.

28:00.343 --> 28:03.653
"I fear we may not meet again...

28:03.688 --> 28:06.168
"in this life.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.292
"For the things I did wrong...

28:17.143 --> 28:19.987
"for the things I am about to do...

28:21.283 --> 28:23.288
"but mostly for the life,

28:23.323 --> 28:25.712
"for the love we could not have...

28:28.563 --> 28:30.827
"I am truly sorry. "

28:33.823 --> 28:36.371
I want you to give
this note to Marian.

28:36.406 --> 28:37.967
What for?

28:39.803 --> 28:43.853
There's been a change of plan.
I want you to wait here for her.

28:45.563 --> 28:49.753
Aren't we supposed to help you and
Winchester escape? Yes, after the showdown.

28:49.788 --> 28:53.944
I'll deal with Winchester. Use the
distraction to go and release Sir Edward.

28:53.979 --> 28:57.208
Then take him and Marian to the
forest. I will meet you there.

28:57.243 --> 28:59.568
How are you and
Winchester going to escape?

28:59.603 --> 29:02.948
If the castle guards find you...
Just do as I say.

29:04.383 --> 29:06.908
Please.

29:06.943 --> 29:09.093
I want you to give me your word.

29:15.803 --> 29:17.771
Good.

29:25.983 --> 29:28.611
And thank you, my friends.

29:40.043 --> 29:44.252
I have a message for you,
from King Richard.

29:50.283 --> 29:52.128
I don't like this.

29:52.163 --> 29:54.648
I hate it. It doesn't make sense.

29:54.683 --> 29:58.813
If Marian's in danger, we should be
looking for her. Robin's up to something.

30:02.383 --> 30:07.286
No, you cannot
open people's private letters!

30:10.223 --> 30:12.009
John?

30:13.223 --> 30:14.963
Read it.

30:26.703 --> 30:28.773
Read it for me.

30:33.463 --> 30:35.308
"My dearest Marian.

30:35.343 --> 30:38.187
"I fear we may not meet again...

30:38.222 --> 30:41.668
"in this life. " What?

30:41.703 --> 30:45.588
"We're both to be betrayed
by Winchester... "

30:45.623 --> 30:50.308
"I cannot allow it. All the Black
Knights will be gathered together.

30:50.343 --> 30:55.474
"Winchester, Durham, Rotherham and the
rest of the Sheriff's traitorous gang.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.230
"I may never have the chance again.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.389
"I cannot allow this opportunity
to pass.

31:07.983 --> 31:10.008
"I must kill them.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.468
"I only hope you remember me well.

31:16.503 --> 31:18.971
"Forgive the brutality
of what I'm going to do.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.106
"If England is to live...

31:25.141 --> 31:27.068
"they must die.

31:27.103 --> 31:29.970
"And so, I fear, must I.

31:32.423 --> 31:36.587
"Go to the woods, to fight again.

31:36.622 --> 31:38.788
"Go with my lads.

31:38.823 --> 31:40.764
"I will see you in heaven. "

31:40.799 --> 31:42.705
Let the walls enclose us.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.204
"Goodbye, my love. "

31:49.783 --> 31:53.810
My friends, we are
a brotherhood of steel.

31:55.303 --> 31:57.268
And our time has come.

31:57.303 --> 32:02.229
As a sign of my unbending fastness
to the cause,

32:02.264 --> 32:05.108
I, Vaizey, Sheriff of this shire,

32:05.143 --> 32:11.150
do add my name to
the Great Pact of Nottingham.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.448
And I do make my mark.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.627
Next to add his name,

32:22.662 --> 32:25.352
the Lord Winchester.

32:34.223 --> 32:37.067
As a sign of my unbending fastness
to the cause,

32:37.102 --> 32:39.708
I, Harold, Lord of Winchester,

32:39.743 --> 32:45.386
do add my name to this
Great Pact of Nottingham.

32:47.143 --> 32:51.170
And I do make my mark.

32:55.663 --> 32:57.870
Traitors! Robin Hood!

33:04.783 --> 33:08.833
Winchester, the death of every
man in this room is on your head.

33:10.663 --> 33:16.545
Sheriff, Gisborne, say your prayers.

33:20.723 --> 33:24.545
Hood. Forgive me...

33:45.043 --> 33:47.386
Guards!

33:52.723 --> 33:55.248
Thank you, my Lord Winchester.

33:55.283 --> 34:00.488
A very good little sweetener indeed.
My pleasure.

34:00.523 --> 34:04.027
Gisborne, don't hang your boy.
I've got a better idea.

34:05.163 --> 34:07.768
Cake on the terrace, gentlemen.

34:07.803 --> 34:10.647
If he dies, I die.
If he dies, I die.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.610
Halt! Been looking for you.

34:12.646 --> 34:15.967
Us? How come?

34:16.003 --> 34:18.324
The Sheriff wants musicians outside.

34:18.359 --> 34:20.268
They've caught Robin Hood.

34:46.963 --> 34:50.409
Behold the outlaw!

34:52.603 --> 34:55.967
The... invincible...

34:56.003 --> 34:58.446
and legendary Robin Hood.

34:58.481 --> 35:00.889
And his friend, Allan A Dale.

35:02.123 --> 35:06.008
How fitting, then, that these
two renegades,

35:06.043 --> 35:10.923
these enemies of the law, which makes
them enemies of good King Richard himself,

35:10.958 --> 35:15.803
should provide us with entertainment
on this, the day of the King's birthday.

35:17.043 --> 35:20.012
Thank you, legendary Robin Hood.

35:22.363 --> 35:24.172
Now, the game is very simple.

35:24.207 --> 35:26.248
Fight or fry!

35:26.283 --> 35:29.423
And of course,
the winner gets his freedom.

35:29.458 --> 35:31.323
Cake!

35:33.403 --> 35:35.325
Enjoy!

35:39.063 --> 35:40.769
Poke him, poke him!

35:46.283 --> 35:48.545
You don't have to do this, Allan.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.768
Don't give them the satisfaction.

35:50.803 --> 35:54.204
Even if you do kill me, they won't
let you go. Come on, poke him!

35:54.239 --> 35:57.206
You know, if you had listened,
you might have understood.

35:57.241 --> 36:00.366
You should have given
me a second chance, Robin.

36:12.483 --> 36:14.788
How did you get to be so low?

36:14.823 --> 36:18.348
That was always your problem, Robin.
So high and mighty.

36:18.383 --> 36:21.874
So much better than everyone else.
No, just better than you.

36:33.923 --> 36:35.891
Careful!

37:00.863 --> 37:06.369
Ah! Well, it looks like our little Robin
red-breast is about to become fried chicken!

37:09.423 --> 37:11.414
Oh, I like this! Yes, it's very good!

37:15.243 --> 37:18.167
Music! I'll give him music.

37:21.563 --> 37:24.214
Outlaws! Get them!

37:30.903 --> 37:33.326
Robin! Stop him!

37:41.623 --> 37:43.204
John, thanks.

37:44.823 --> 37:47.212
Traitor! Oi!

37:47.703 --> 37:49.830
I let you in, but I'm
not letting you out.

37:55.383 --> 37:56.964
Told you I was good with wood.

37:58.623 --> 38:00.773
Time to disappear.

38:03.223 --> 38:04.793
What's he doing?

38:11.383 --> 38:12.771
Oh, no...

38:18.023 --> 38:19.672
This way!

38:25.143 --> 38:26.883
Guards!

38:37.003 --> 38:38.686
Guards!

38:44.683 --> 38:49.108
Well, you said it would be entertaining,
but that was really something!

38:49.143 --> 38:51.128
And once again, gentlemen,

38:51.163 --> 38:54.872
it was a pleasure doing
business with you. Bring the girl.

38:54.907 --> 38:56.444
Marian...

38:57.703 --> 38:59.967
Marian...

39:01.743 --> 39:06.612
I'm surprised you gave in to his
demands. I had to get his signature!

39:08.383 --> 39:09.948
But now...

39:09.983 --> 39:13.248
I have his signature.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.108
I'll send a squad of men. No.

39:18.143 --> 39:22.728
No, we do this one quietly.
Bring your boy.

39:43.663 --> 39:45.688
Home!

40:00.943 --> 40:02.433
Here they come.

40:03.263 --> 40:06.268
Get your hands off me.

40:06.303 --> 40:09.708
Spirit! Just like your mother.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.068
Will, you take out
the two outriders.

40:12.103 --> 40:16.346
Much, John, Djaq,
you cover me while I rescue Marian.

40:16.381 --> 40:19.392
What are they doing?
They're stopping!

40:23.983 --> 40:25.553
Why have we stopped?

40:30.063 --> 40:33.268
It's you! Yes, me.

40:33.303 --> 40:37.751
Did you really think that I would
just smile and let you have Sussex?

40:38.343 --> 40:41.983
A clue. No.

40:43.063 --> 40:44.348
Hmmm?

40:49.343 --> 40:50.787
Marian.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.785
A little sweetener for you.

41:01.820 --> 41:04.024
A little bonus.

41:10.223 --> 41:12.191
You're safe now, Marian. Thank you.

41:19.083 --> 41:22.029
Sweet. Very sweet.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.048
What?

41:42.083 --> 41:44.688
I'm trying to think of the good bit.

41:44.723 --> 41:48.250
Even on a bad day, there's
always something good.

41:48.285 --> 41:50.808
That's what my mother used to say.

41:50.843 --> 41:55.689
But today, Winchester's betrayed us,
the pact has been signed.

41:55.724 --> 41:59.551
Allan is Gisborne's man.
Marian's galloped off.

42:03.323 --> 42:06.212
I mean, help me out here,
cos I'm struggling!

42:06.247 --> 42:07.966
Much, shut up.

42:14.643 --> 42:16.128
Robin's alive.

42:16.163 --> 42:17.848
That's a good thing.

42:17.883 --> 42:22.570
That's a very good thing. Because for a minute
there, that was looking... Shut up, Much!

42:26.963 --> 42:29.443
And if I may say so...
Much, shut up!

42:34.283 --> 42:37.389
We can't just eat in silence!
Shut up, Much!

42:40.643 --> 42:42.544
We have to go back and get
that pact.

42:42.579 --> 42:44.445
It's proof of the Sheriff's treason.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.808
Raaaghhh! It's empty!

42:46.843 --> 42:50.791
We are gathered here to witness
my marvellous bird cage.

42:50.826 --> 42:52.448
Robin! Get me down!

42:52.483 --> 42:55.407
The Sheriff's selling Beatrice
to the Earl of Durham.

42:55.442 --> 42:57.974
We're here to escort the
prisoner to the Earl.

42:58.483 --> 43:00.857
Looking for me, Sheriff? Guards!

43:00.892 --> 43:03.231
Where's the pact? I don't have it.
