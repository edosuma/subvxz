WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:05.038
Okay, so get this. The
kids brushed their teeth

00:05.063 --> 00:06.295
and went straight to bed.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.564
I think somebody replaced
'em with Pod People.

00:09.534 --> 00:10.907
I mean, I'm gonna miss 'em,

00:10.932 --> 00:12.765
but I am not complaining.

00:14.050 --> 00:16.071
You're welcome.

00:16.627 --> 00:18.263
Oh, you're taking credit for this?

00:18.288 --> 00:19.153
Yes, I am.

00:19.155 --> 00:20.588
Because after school today,

00:20.590 --> 00:22.089
your kids were out of control.

00:22.091 --> 00:24.205
Our living room was
like the first 15 minutes

00:24.230 --> 00:25.793
of Saving Private Ryan.

00:26.996 --> 00:29.597
Okay, so they're my kids
when they do something wrong?

00:29.599 --> 00:32.366
Yeah, or when they're in a school play.

00:32.368 --> 00:33.868
Yeah, three hours

00:33.870 --> 00:36.204
of watching Emme be a
tree in The Wizard of Oz.

00:36.206 --> 00:37.371
The witch said, "I'm melting."

00:37.373 --> 00:39.073
I was like, "Take me with you."

00:41.678 --> 00:44.612
That's like Club Med compared
to what I dealt with today.

00:44.614 --> 00:45.980
While I was on the phone with a client,

00:45.982 --> 00:48.516
the kids decided to have
a Nerf dart shootout.

00:48.518 --> 00:51.652
Katie nails me in the face, right?

00:51.654 --> 00:54.021
And I open my mouth
in surprise, as you do.

00:54.023 --> 00:56.657
Right? Teddy rolls by on his skateboard

00:56.659 --> 00:59.360
and shoots one down my throat.

01:00.196 --> 01:01.562
I coughed up the foam part,

01:01.564 --> 01:04.632
but the rubber tip is
still inside me somewhere.

01:04.634 --> 01:05.774
Oh, honey.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.137
Yeah, well, it won't happen again

01:07.139 --> 01:08.371
because I handled it.

01:08.373 --> 01:10.371
The way you kids behaved today

01:10.396 --> 01:12.705
was completely unacceptable, okay?

01:12.730 --> 01:14.730
So from now on, there will be no

01:14.732 --> 01:17.166
skateboards, no Nerf wars,

01:17.168 --> 01:20.206
no monkey business in the house.

01:20.231 --> 01:22.065
What's a monkey's business?

01:23.508 --> 01:25.107
It's an old person word for fun.

01:25.109 --> 01:26.642
He's trying to ban fun.

01:26.644 --> 01:29.378
That's exactly right, Katie.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.013
I'm banning fun.

01:31.876 --> 01:35.518
So until further notice, all of these...

01:35.520 --> 01:37.353
will go in the off-limits cubby.

01:37.355 --> 01:38.893
No!

01:38.918 --> 01:41.056
All right, get in there.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.930
I really wish that had a door on it.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.399
God, I wonder why they were so wound up?

01:51.669 --> 01:53.066
Oh, you know what? It rained today

01:53.091 --> 01:54.336
so they didn't have recess.

01:54.338 --> 01:55.905
That always makes 'em a little crazy.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.908
They seemed fine after
school at the ice cream place.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.243
You took 'em for ice cream?

02:02.268 --> 02:04.380
Yeah, well, you know I like ice cream.

02:04.382 --> 02:06.749
And if I want to eat
it, I got buy them some.

02:08.550 --> 02:09.884
What difference does it make?

02:09.887 --> 02:12.054
I'm just trying to figure
out why they were so nuts.

02:12.079 --> 02:12.873
Well, it doesn't matter why.

02:12.898 --> 02:14.233
- I handled it.
- Okay,

02:14.258 --> 02:16.839
but you didn't take
everything into consideration.

02:16.864 --> 02:17.893
Look,

02:17.895 --> 02:18.961
different situations

02:18.963 --> 02:20.296
require different reactions.

02:20.298 --> 02:21.664
Like if it were me,

02:21.666 --> 02:22.998
I would have taken 'em to the park,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.133
let 'em run it out.

02:24.135 --> 02:26.835
You know, like dogs.

02:30.074 --> 02:31.907
Nah.

02:31.909 --> 02:33.509
Yelling and taking stuff away,

02:33.511 --> 02:35.978
that's my move.

02:36.279 --> 02:37.745
Okay, but...

02:37.770 --> 02:38.914
now that you're home with the kids more,

02:38.916 --> 02:41.450
you might want to expand your playbook.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.751
I don't think so.

02:42.753 --> 02:43.919
I have one move.

02:43.921 --> 02:45.407
My dad had one move.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.699
My dad's dad had one move.

02:47.799 --> 02:49.365
And that one move

02:49.390 --> 02:50.990
won two world wars.

02:52.296 --> 02:54.196
Trust me, we didn't take the Germans

02:54.198 --> 02:55.998
to the park and let 'em run it out.

02:58.822 --> 03:01.916
I'm telling you, if you
put two round hot tubs

03:01.941 --> 03:03.482
at the end of a long pool,

03:03.507 --> 03:04.974
from the second story balcony,

03:04.976 --> 03:06.342
you're gonna get a very...

03:06.344 --> 03:09.578
masculine view.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.746
If you know what I'm sayin'.

03:10.748 --> 03:13.282
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

03:13.498 --> 03:14.741
I will take care of it.

03:14.766 --> 03:15.718
All right, bye.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.486
Gee.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.954
- Hey.
- Hey, how was your day?

03:18.956 --> 03:19.721
How were the kids?

03:19.746 --> 03:21.023
They were fantastic.

03:21.025 --> 03:22.958
Listen to the sound...

03:22.960 --> 03:24.493
of silence.

03:25.829 --> 03:26.762
Huh?

03:26.764 --> 03:28.744
My one move... the perfect move...

03:28.769 --> 03:29.798
is still working.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.500
In fact, it's so good, I named it:

03:31.502 --> 03:32.901
The Velvet Hammer.

03:34.829 --> 03:36.162
Um,

03:36.187 --> 03:37.987
isn't that the name of the gay bar

03:38.012 --> 03:40.145
by the ice cream shop?

03:41.316 --> 03:43.646
It doesn't matter where
the name came from.

03:45.263 --> 03:46.860
That's what I'm calling it.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.314
Mm-kay, well,

03:48.339 --> 03:50.052
- good for you, honey. 
- Mm-kay.

03:51.055 --> 03:52.388
What was that?

03:52.390 --> 03:53.922
I don't know, but it better not be fun.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.029 --> 04:05.196
Something happened in here.

04:07.371 --> 04:09.838
It's quiet.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.341
A little too quiet.

04:12.981 --> 04:15.344
And empty.

04:15.346 --> 04:17.079
A little too empty.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.548
And that rug

04:20.551 --> 04:21.850
is on the wall.

04:22.365 --> 04:24.139
A little too on the wall.

04:25.823 --> 04:27.589
Are you done, Columbo?

04:28.505 --> 04:30.759
It's so fun, though.

04:39.470 --> 04:42.905
Oh, my God, your kids
put a hole in the wall.

04:53.599 --> 04:55.141
Okay, I need to know

04:55.166 --> 04:56.266
who made the hole,

04:56.268 --> 04:57.562
how they made the hole,

04:57.587 --> 04:59.921
and why they tried to hide the hole.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.673
What hole?

05:05.243 --> 05:06.843
The hole in the wall.

05:06.845 --> 05:09.479
You mean, like, the window?

05:09.481 --> 05:11.145
N-No, no.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.537
I mean like that.

05:13.718 --> 05:17.053
Whoa, where did that come from?

05:20.916 --> 05:23.383
You know, I-I think
that's always been there.

05:24.696 --> 05:27.063
Maybe we have a mouse.

05:28.366 --> 05:30.199
Um...

05:30.201 --> 05:31.567
can I see you in the kitchen?

05:31.569 --> 05:33.536
No! I'm getting to the bottom of this.

05:33.538 --> 05:35.104
Are you?

05:37.440 --> 05:39.207
Okay, you three stay put.

05:40.679 --> 05:42.879
Will you get me a
Go-Gurt from the fridge?

05:48.787 --> 05:50.887
What fridge?

05:51.548 --> 05:52.519
See?

05:52.544 --> 05:54.911
Two can play at that game.

05:55.684 --> 05:57.217
What game?

06:06.237 --> 06:07.603
What is going on in there?

06:07.605 --> 06:10.073
Have they ever stonewalled
you like that before?

06:10.075 --> 06:11.307
Well, yeah, a few times,

06:11.309 --> 06:12.375
but I always had a move.

06:12.377 --> 06:13.343
What was it?

06:13.345 --> 06:14.844
"Wait until your father gets home."

06:15.330 --> 06:16.907
I'm already home.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.948
Yes, that's why we're in the kitchen.

06:21.302 --> 06:23.586
I can't believe they formed an alliance.

06:23.588 --> 06:25.621
Well... it's actually kind of sweet.

06:25.623 --> 06:27.890
I mean, I am always telling
them to stick together.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.026
Who knew it would backfire?

06:30.962 --> 06:32.862
Parenting's hard.

06:32.864 --> 06:34.931
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.966
If they're sticking together,
we got to split 'em up, right?

06:36.968 --> 06:38.634
Yes.

06:38.636 --> 06:40.570
And make them understand
it's in their best interest

06:40.572 --> 06:42.004
to be on our team.

06:42.604 --> 06:45.641
So what are we gonna
use, threats or bribes?

06:45.643 --> 06:48.244
Uh, well, threats are free.
Let's start with those.

06:48.246 --> 06:49.479
Good.

06:49.848 --> 06:51.391
Oh, look,

06:51.416 --> 06:53.655
Katie's trophy from
when her volleyball team

06:53.680 --> 06:55.451
- won regional's.
- Hmm.

06:55.453 --> 06:57.587
Our girl really does
love her volleyball,

06:57.589 --> 06:58.988
- doesn't she?
- Mmm.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.356
What are you guys doing?

07:01.987 --> 07:02.892
You, uh,

07:02.894 --> 07:05.628
you have a volleyball
camp coming up, don't you?

07:05.630 --> 07:06.662
Yeah.

07:06.664 --> 07:08.398
Boy, I'd hate for you to get grounded

07:08.400 --> 07:12.502
and miss it, just because of
some stupid hole in the wall.

07:13.231 --> 07:15.378
I don't want to miss my camp.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.006
Here we go.

07:17.876 --> 07:18.941
I mean,

07:18.943 --> 07:21.344
if I don't go to camp,

07:21.346 --> 07:23.579
I'd feel bad for you guys.

07:26.484 --> 07:29.185
Um, what's that?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.087
That's the weekend Teddy
and Emme are supposed to

07:31.089 --> 07:32.355
stay at Grandma and Grandpa's.

07:32.357 --> 07:33.656
You guys are gonna have

07:33.658 --> 07:35.024
the whole house to yourself.

07:36.694 --> 07:38.161
Oh, well.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.400
Can I see you in the hall?

07:44.402 --> 07:45.802
Mm-hmm.

07:45.804 --> 07:47.203
We are getting our weekend alone.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.122
I don't care if they
burn the house down.

07:50.058 --> 07:51.724
And we never should
have started with Katie,

07:51.726 --> 07:53.133
that was a rookie mistake.

07:53.158 --> 07:54.039
You're right.

07:54.064 --> 07:55.361
She's too smart.

07:55.363 --> 07:57.363
We need to go to the dumb one.

07:57.365 --> 08:00.416
Hey, hey. I don't think
any of our kids are dumb.

08:01.654 --> 08:03.620
But I will follow you to Teddy's room.

08:05.190 --> 08:08.524
Boy, is this room crowded.

08:08.526 --> 08:10.092
You know,

08:10.094 --> 08:11.494
if you had Katie's room,

08:11.496 --> 08:14.981
you'd have space to
set up all your toys.

08:14.983 --> 08:17.300
But, you said Kate gets the bigger room

08:17.302 --> 08:18.584
because she's older.

08:18.586 --> 08:20.953
Ah, she's had her time.

08:22.157 --> 08:23.890
Tell us who made the hole,

08:23.892 --> 08:25.358
the room is yours.

08:26.126 --> 08:27.960
Kate said I shouldn't
answer any questions

08:27.962 --> 08:29.829
without representation.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.267
He's trying to lawyer up.

08:34.554 --> 08:37.870
Wait, where did you learn
the word "representation"?

08:37.871 --> 08:40.389
Kate wrote it on my hand.

08:42.227 --> 08:44.260
Are you gonna talk or not?

08:45.585 --> 08:47.163
No.

08:48.739 --> 08:51.234
- Can I see you in the hallway? 
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.236 --> 08:53.603
That boy has learned more
in an hour with Katie,

08:53.605 --> 08:55.805
than he has in five years of school.

08:56.708 --> 08:57.940
What now?

08:57.942 --> 08:59.277
We've only got one kid left.

08:59.302 --> 09:00.860
I don't even know why we
stopped in the hall this time.

09:00.885 --> 09:02.178
Yeah.

09:02.563 --> 09:05.815
Let's talk a little bit
about Santa Claus. Hmm?

09:06.751 --> 09:08.484
He knows when you've been naughty

09:08.486 --> 09:09.752
and he knows when you've been nice.

09:09.754 --> 09:11.220
So, is there something

09:11.222 --> 09:12.221
you want to tell us right now?

09:12.223 --> 09:13.214
I mean...

09:13.239 --> 09:15.973
could really help you
out with the big guy.

09:18.653 --> 09:22.348
I'm comfortable with my
relationship with Santa.

09:27.476 --> 09:29.288
- Hall.
- Hall.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.632
Hey, do you guys want to
watch a movie in my room?

09:36.740 --> 09:38.192
Yeah, can I pick the movie?

09:38.217 --> 09:39.249
Of course.

09:39.251 --> 09:42.452
I just want to hang out with you guys.

09:45.424 --> 09:46.590
Unbelievable.

09:46.592 --> 09:47.991
Did you see how happy they are?

09:50.062 --> 09:51.428
Of course they're happy,

09:51.430 --> 09:53.130
they just kicked our ass.

09:54.117 --> 09:55.983
That was like a victory dinner for them.

09:57.093 --> 09:58.609
Okay, okay, we got to regroup.

09:58.721 --> 10:00.695
We tried bribery, we tried threats.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.353
What's our next move?

10:02.424 --> 10:04.443
I don't know, maybe we
should just patch the hole,

10:04.468 --> 10:05.826
ground 'em all and move on.

10:06.226 --> 10:09.000
I mean, eventually, the
truth'll just slip out.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.668
Like that Nerf dart you ate.

10:13.692 --> 10:16.580
We cannot live in a
world where holes are made

10:16.605 --> 10:17.838
and not explained.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.340
We'll lose all credibility.

10:20.342 --> 10:22.102
I know, I'm sorry,

10:22.127 --> 10:24.169
it's just I'm so tired.

10:25.020 --> 10:25.963
Okay, all right.

10:25.965 --> 10:27.314
We got to think.

10:27.316 --> 10:28.498
Okay, um...

10:28.500 --> 10:29.490
all right.

10:29.515 --> 10:30.898
What would happen if we pulled

10:30.936 --> 10:32.936
something like this when we were kids?

10:34.091 --> 10:35.806
Oh.

10:36.321 --> 10:38.258
It worked on me.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.377
Did it?

10:42.517 --> 10:43.949
No.

10:44.794 --> 10:46.557
Yeah, and we're nothing to be scared of.

10:46.582 --> 10:49.069
We're like mall cops.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.494
Remember how we used to laugh

10:52.519 --> 10:54.578
when your brother
Don's kid would act up?

10:54.603 --> 10:56.643
That kid was always in trouble.

10:56.645 --> 10:59.746
Now? Delivering Porta-Potties.

10:59.748 --> 11:02.316
Hey, wait a minute.

11:02.318 --> 11:03.717
Maybe we can use that.

11:03.719 --> 11:04.985
You know,

11:04.987 --> 11:07.888
give our kids a little
glimpse into their future.

11:08.457 --> 11:10.390
Scare 'em straight.

11:10.392 --> 11:12.678
Ooh, I like it.

11:13.108 --> 11:14.013
Yeah.

11:14.038 --> 11:16.997
I mean, in the last day,
our kids have engaged in

11:16.999 --> 11:21.101
vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.

11:22.490 --> 11:23.804
I don't really know what that is,

11:23.806 --> 11:25.739
but they make a hell of a racket.

11:28.164 --> 11:30.390
Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.

11:30.415 --> 11:33.216
What you don't know is
that he is also a father.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.382
Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.

11:35.384 --> 11:37.217
Okay, I'm trying to set a mood here.

11:38.587 --> 11:40.854
After you hear what he
has to say about his kid,

11:40.856 --> 11:43.156
you'll be begging to
tell us who made the hole.

11:43.158 --> 11:44.274
Don,

11:44.299 --> 11:46.032
go ahead, scare 'em straight.

11:46.161 --> 11:47.494
Will do.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.482
Mikey was just like you.

11:52.484 --> 11:53.868
Always making holes

11:53.893 --> 11:55.736
in walls and lying about it.

11:55.993 --> 11:57.698
Seemed like no big deal.

11:58.143 --> 12:00.324
But where is he now?

12:00.326 --> 12:01.958
Prison?

12:03.062 --> 12:07.531
No. A studio apartment in Poughkeepsie.

12:07.533 --> 12:08.320
- Oh.
- Ooh.

12:08.345 --> 12:11.385
- That's pretty cool.
- No, no, no. No, that's bad.

12:11.387 --> 12:13.000
A studio apartment is just one room.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.805
The kitchen is in the bedroom.

12:14.807 --> 12:16.206
- Oh, it's like...
- Oh, it's one of those things...

12:17.843 --> 12:20.210
Yeah, yeah, you know, it is
actually a sweet little place

12:20.212 --> 12:21.445
right next to the ballpark.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.851
Mikey's a mascot

12:22.876 --> 12:24.192
for the minor league baseball team.

12:24.217 --> 12:25.966
- Oh, no way.
- That's so cool.

12:25.968 --> 12:28.220
You said he was
delivering Porta-Potties.

12:28.245 --> 12:29.095
No, no, no.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.253
This is a new thing.

12:30.509 --> 12:32.055
He really got his act together.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.068
I guess it just goes to show

12:34.093 --> 12:36.226
that it doesn't matter
what you do as a kid.

12:36.228 --> 12:39.496
Sometimes your dreams come true.

12:42.939 --> 12:44.326
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy.

12:44.351 --> 12:45.779
"Bye, Daddy."

12:45.804 --> 12:47.988
As if nothing happened.

12:47.990 --> 12:50.574
Kindergarteners can head
out to the playground.

12:50.576 --> 12:53.427
Okay, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:53.429 --> 12:56.279
Okay, it's just you and me, Butterbean.

12:56.281 --> 12:57.681
Nobody's listening.

12:57.683 --> 12:59.833
Why don't you tell
Daddy who made the hole.

12:59.835 --> 13:01.034
What hole?

13:05.841 --> 13:07.641
Get out of here.

13:08.444 --> 13:10.644
- Bye, Daddy.
- Yeah, bye.

13:11.964 --> 13:13.470
Oh. Hey, I'm glad you guys are here.

13:13.495 --> 13:14.765
I need to talk to you.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.032
Things no better at home?

13:16.034 --> 13:17.929
The kids are lying.
We know they're lying.

13:17.954 --> 13:20.487
They know we know they're lying.

13:20.489 --> 13:22.389
It's tough to control kids these days.

13:22.391 --> 13:23.858
Victor's in fourth grade,

13:23.883 --> 13:27.284
and I'm pretty sure he
took my car out last night.

13:27.309 --> 13:29.469
You know, a couple years
ago, my wife and I decided

13:29.494 --> 13:31.348
we were gonna stop
telling the girls "no,"

13:31.350 --> 13:32.716
because it's very negative.

13:32.718 --> 13:35.669
But then one of them
bought a boat on eBay.

13:36.688 --> 13:38.822
Now we say it all the time.

13:40.262 --> 13:41.686
Mr. Burns, come with me,

13:41.711 --> 13:43.193
and put on your listening ears.

13:43.195 --> 13:44.561
Okay, you don't have to talk to me

13:44.563 --> 13:45.879
- like I'm a kindergartener.
- Now.

13:45.904 --> 13:47.603
Yes, ma'am.

13:49.702 --> 13:52.203
I'm about to tell you something
I've never told anyone,

13:52.205 --> 13:53.637
Please don't.

13:55.224 --> 13:56.357
The issue you're up against

13:56.359 --> 13:57.525
with kids in today's world

13:57.527 --> 13:58.976
is that it's not a fair fight.

13:58.978 --> 14:01.787
Yeah. That's what I was
telling Andi last night.

14:01.812 --> 14:03.798
We can't use any of
the tools our parents

14:03.800 --> 14:05.266
or teachers used on us.

14:05.268 --> 14:08.736
So the answer I came up with is this.

14:08.738 --> 14:10.271
See this marble jar?

14:10.273 --> 14:11.972
Every day the kids behave,

14:11.974 --> 14:13.441
I add a marble.

14:13.443 --> 14:15.476
When the jar is full, they get a party.

14:15.478 --> 14:17.361
But what they don't know is

14:17.363 --> 14:19.847
sometimes I do this.

14:26.556 --> 14:29.056
That makes me feel so damn good.

14:29.892 --> 14:31.158
I think maybe the kids stole

14:31.160 --> 14:32.660
some of your marbles.

14:34.330 --> 14:37.932
My point is, Mr. Burns, is
don't be afraid to fight dirty.

14:37.934 --> 14:40.167
I see what you're getting at.

14:40.169 --> 14:42.636
- Yeah.
- Don't touch my marbles!

14:42.638 --> 14:44.538
I wo... I won't. I won't, no.

14:45.741 --> 14:47.208
So we're really gonna do this?

14:47.210 --> 14:49.343
Hey, Mrs. Rodriguez said to fight dirty.

14:49.345 --> 14:50.845
Well, this is definitely dirty

14:50.847 --> 14:53.514
because I feel both excited and ashamed.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.289
It's kind of like that time

14:56.314 --> 14:59.415
we did it on my parents' bed.

15:00.223 --> 15:03.390
Uh, different boyfriend.

15:06.529 --> 15:08.662
Whoops.

15:08.664 --> 15:10.364
Okay, we'll circle back to that later.

15:10.366 --> 15:11.398
You ready to do this?

15:11.400 --> 15:12.700
No guts, no glory.

15:12.702 --> 15:13.734
Okay.

15:14.236 --> 15:15.636
Ladies and gentleman,

15:15.638 --> 15:18.806
this is your Halloween candy.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.452
Kate, what's happening?

15:30.016 --> 15:31.813
I think he's gonna take it away.

15:31.838 --> 15:34.688
Oh, no, no, no. Much worse.

15:34.690 --> 15:37.691
I'm gonna take it away from two of you.

15:37.693 --> 15:39.226
Mom, you're letting him do this?

15:39.228 --> 15:41.395
Oh, absolutely.

15:41.397 --> 15:43.831
Whoever tells us about the hole

15:43.833 --> 15:44.999
gets it all.

15:45.001 --> 15:46.033
Every

15:46.035 --> 15:47.868
single

15:47.870 --> 15:50.671
- piece.
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.673 --> 15:54.575
Okay, so you three
have a decision to make.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.961
We'll give you a couple
minutes to decide.

16:02.985 --> 16:05.064
We got to be strong. They're bluffing.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.789
I'm taking the deal.

16:08.207 --> 16:10.774
Teddy, man up!

16:13.015 --> 16:14.181
That was incredible.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.072
Can you see 'em? How do they look?

16:16.215 --> 16:17.581
Oh, they're rattled.

16:18.105 --> 16:19.938
- I like our chances.
- Okay.

16:23.256 --> 16:26.557
Okay, now we come to the big question.

16:26.559 --> 16:28.954
Who wants the candy?

16:33.508 --> 16:34.932
Here we go.

16:39.805 --> 16:41.005
No deal.

16:43.409 --> 16:46.243
What?! Okay, okay,

16:46.245 --> 16:48.646
no one's leaving unless
someone confesses.

16:48.648 --> 16:50.281
I don't even care if they're lying now.

16:51.117 --> 16:52.750
What are we doing?

16:52.752 --> 16:55.553
I mean, we are tearing
this family apart.

16:55.555 --> 16:59.623
And why? Just because of-of
some tiny hole in the wall?

16:59.625 --> 17:00.858
I mean,

17:00.860 --> 17:02.857
I just... I can't do this anymore.

17:02.882 --> 17:04.589
All we ever do is fight.

17:04.614 --> 17:06.981
And it's all my fault.

17:09.006 --> 17:10.356
Okay, honey, what's happening?

17:14.522 --> 17:17.992
Mom, don't cry.

17:18.861 --> 17:20.560
It's my fault.

17:20.563 --> 17:21.795
I made the hole.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.135
- It's my fault, too.
- Wh...?

17:28.137 --> 17:30.704
I took the skateboard out of the
cubby and dared him to ride it.

17:32.074 --> 17:34.208
Come on, Mom, please stop crying.

17:34.210 --> 17:36.410
And that's how you do that.

17:39.716 --> 17:41.082
What?

17:41.107 --> 17:42.940
Wow.

17:43.691 --> 17:45.753
Wait, you were faking? No fair!

17:45.755 --> 17:47.288
You left me no choice.

17:48.037 --> 17:49.023
They're all yours.

17:51.274 --> 17:53.814
Y-Yeah, yeah. Uh, Katie, Teddy,

17:53.839 --> 17:56.196
you are grounded, uh, for two weeks.

17:56.198 --> 17:58.198
No phones, no computers.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.669
Emme, you're cute.

18:01.671 --> 18:04.838
Grab a lollipop and go play.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.448
Well, that was a fun game.

18:06.473 --> 18:08.262
Yeah.

18:09.387 --> 18:10.778
Where did that come from?

18:10.780 --> 18:13.330
Eh, well, when all
else fails, Mama cries.

18:13.897 --> 18:16.700
Well, you scared me. I
almost said I made the hole.

18:19.356 --> 18:21.273
Well, when I saw the
candy thing going south,

18:21.298 --> 18:22.878
I knew I had to pull out the big guns.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.667
Yeah, but now you told 'em.
So we can never use it again.

18:25.692 --> 18:28.267
No, no, no, not true. It always works.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.297
Because what if I'm really crying?

18:30.299 --> 18:33.400
Yeah...

18:34.187 --> 18:36.770
Those dopes'll fall for it every time.

18:38.919 --> 18:41.442
Wait, have you ever used that on me?

18:42.719 --> 18:44.345
No.

18:46.134 --> 18:47.788
Hold on, hold on.

18:47.813 --> 18:50.531
That time you cried to get
me to go see the Dixie Chicks,

18:50.788 --> 18:52.386
fake or real?

18:53.556 --> 18:55.199
Super fake.

18:55.397 --> 18:58.892
Uh, hot air balloon ride
to see the fall foliage?

18:59.660 --> 19:00.794
Fake-a-rooney.

19:03.525 --> 19:06.414
Four days at the bed-and-breakfast

19:06.439 --> 19:09.536
with no TV when the Penguins
were in the play-offs?

19:09.538 --> 19:12.406
Oh, no, no, no, babe, that was real.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.789
Good.

19:14.814 --> 19:15.941
Okay.

19:28.942 --> 19:31.115
- Hey.
- Hey, hon. Oh, remember,

19:31.140 --> 19:32.533
you need to get your suit dry-cleaned

19:32.558 --> 19:34.208
for my high school reunion this weekend.

19:34.933 --> 19:35.876
Oh.

19:35.878 --> 19:37.344
That's this weekend?

19:38.683 --> 19:40.807
Ooh, I don't think I can make it. I...

19:40.832 --> 19:42.766
Honey, you said you'd go with me.

19:43.019 --> 19:45.414
Yeah, but that was before you
told me about you and that guy

19:45.439 --> 19:47.873
in your parents' bed.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.547
I mean,

19:51.572 --> 19:54.428
if I have to walk in there...

19:56.965 --> 19:58.836
and meet that guy...

20:00.436 --> 20:03.437
He could fall in love
with you all over again.

20:17.432 --> 20:21.622
You... bringing up that guy
really hurts my feelings, Adam.

20:21.624 --> 20:23.824
I mean...

20:24.123 --> 20:25.593
that was a long time ago, you know?

20:25.595 --> 20:28.362
I mean, way before I met you.

20:29.015 --> 20:30.831
I mean, it's not like you didn't
have other girlfriends, too,

20:30.833 --> 20:31.945
- you know?
- Oh, oh, oh,

20:31.970 --> 20:34.445
oh, I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:34.470 --> 20:38.405
I didn't mean... oh-oh,
of course I'll go.

20:38.407 --> 20:39.400
Told you it'd work again.

20:39.425 --> 20:40.491
Aw!
