you start talking
to each other.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.415
I thought I would give you
a few issues to discuss.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.504
Allison Blake.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.335
Oh, crap!

00:13.472 --> 00:14.507
You're a dead woman!

00:14.556 --> 00:15.591
I'm all yours, princess.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.173
Like your problem with Carter
is strictly professional.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.467
I hate the way
he looks at you.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.726
Oh, I don't look
at her.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.394
Oh, please,
like a shark-eyeing chum.
Really?

00:23.482 --> 00:25.598
Am I supposed to ignore that
Mayberry's hitting on my wife?

00:25.692 --> 00:26.681
Soon to be "ex."

00:26.735 --> 00:27.975
You do realize
I'm standing right here?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.519
Don't the two of you
ever get tired of bickering?
Not really.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.526
All anyone around here
does is feed on me.

what to say.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.851
Don't say anything.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.514
In fact, you've the right
to remain silent.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.647
Anything you say...

01:07.734 --> 01:09.816
Carter,
what are you doing?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.235

and you're welcome.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.192

01:16.076 --> 01:18.283

01:19.454 --> 01:22.582
Which was what?
To atomize your facility, huh?

01:23.208 --> 01:24.243
A little help, Allison.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.126
I'm sorry, Carter.
Technically, he hasn't
broken any laws.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.753
Un-cuff him, Sheriff.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.087

01:35.929 --> 01:38.762
You know what?
Here, do it yourself.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.089

one of your braniacs

01:40.142 --> 01:41.382

your building,

01:41.435 --> 01:42.766
don't think
I'm going to stop him.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.346
In fact, I might help.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.368
SARAH, beer!

02:02.873 --> 02:04.113
Morning.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.956
Nice hair.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.367
Thanks.
I've been working
on it all night.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.037
Shouldn't you
be at school?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.462
Shouldn't you
be at work?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.839
Nope. It's a sick day.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.179
SARAH: Your vital signs
seem normal, Sheriff.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.719
I don 't detect
that you’re sick.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.137
But I am sick.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.053
I'm sick of saving a man
that I can't stand.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.554
I'm sick of nobody
saying "thank you,"

02:25.646 --> 02:28.763
and I'm sick
of this ridiculous town,
and everyone in it.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.975
Well, aren't you
in a mood?

02:30.067 --> 02:32.149
Mmm-hmm.
SARAH, fill it.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.612
Breakfast of champions.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.940
Mmm-hmm.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.481
And go to school, already.
You're ruining my sick day.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.864
Okay, what is this about?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.488
This isn't just about
you being pissed at Stark.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.910
I don't even want
to hear that name,
so that's a new house rule.

02:48.001 --> 02:53.086
And, FYI,
last night's catastrophe
gave me some clarity.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.209
About?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.541
I think Henry's
got the right idea.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.467
You know, getting
while the getting's good?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.049
Dad, are you serious?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.300
Do you know
what's going to happen
to this town when he leaves?

03:03.350 --> 03:06.467
He's the glue and
I'm the one who's gonna have
to pick up all the pieces.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.680
So...

03:08.522 --> 03:11.764
I don't know.
I think he should stay.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.981
Is that what
this is really about?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.645
Henry leaving?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.067
Go on. You're going
to be late for school.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.200
Is it okay to
leave you alone?

03:27.249 --> 03:29.035
SARAH: No...
Yeah!

03:29.084 --> 03:31.700
I'm gonna be fine.
And I'm sick,
until further notice.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.880
SARAH?

03:37.634 --> 03:40.216
I need you to do
a property search for Baja.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.918
Are you planning
a vacation?

03:42.013 --> 03:44.140
Yeah, maybe a permanent one.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.358
SARAH: Any plans today?
Perhaps a shower?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.898
I do that everyday,
and today is...

04:02.993 --> 04:04.608
Another sick day?
Bingo!

04:04.703 --> 04:07.695
So, let's go bottom left.

How about that upper right?

07:57.686 --> 07:58.846

what imminent disaster?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.564
Is it a hurricane?
An earthquake?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.477
The threads
of human congruity
are unraveling.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.239
It has already led
to Dr. Deacon 's decision
to leave Eureka.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.859
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.950
SARAH, Henry leaving Eureka
doesn't mean we're facing
imminent disaster.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.201

no offense, Henry.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.327
No offense taken.

that each person in this room

There is a high probability
that Dr. Deacon 's decision
to relocate

09:20.268 --> 09:23.556
will precipitate a series
of catastrophic events,

09:23.605 --> 09:25.766
beginning with the fact
that Sheriff Carter

09:25.857 --> 09:29.395

his commitment to Eureka,
as well.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.027
No, he hasn't.

What about vacation homes?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.317

It's a really good fantasy.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.738
Yeah.

if interpersonal conflicts
cause both men to leave,

09:48.213 --> 09:52.752

Too small.
Too closely.

an opportunity

Nothing. Gotta go.
Carter needs us.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.715
You designed
a paintball battle plan?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.884
Give me that. You know,
you are in clear violation

12:08.937 --> 12:11.223
of the paintball
rules of engagement.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.522
Me? You've got
a regiment of splatter-bots

12:14.567 --> 12:16.558
ready to assault
my rear flank.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.102
You'll know
when I assault
your rear flank.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.741
Did you tuck my sheets in
real tight?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.243
Henry, please,
just change your mind

12:31.334 --> 12:33.245
so we can all
get the hell out of here.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.247
Yeah. I can sit
on my couch.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.082
Ihavent
changed my mind.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.296
(SOFTLY)
Maybe you could just pretend.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.342
I'm pretty sure
that SARAH can
hear you guys.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.295
Why are you
leaving, Henry?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.006
Because our work
has become about results,
instead of discovery.

12:48.101 --> 12:52.185
You don't get funding
for discovery unless
someone is producing results.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.308
That's an ugly
shortsighted system.

12:54.399 --> 12:58.017
I mean, Fargo turns
a relic of war into
something beautiful

12:58.111 --> 13:00.318
and life affirming
and then gets chastised

13:00.405 --> 13:03.272
because it's actually trying
to help us avert disaster.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.574
He got chastised because
it's holding us hostage.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.779
Fine. You know what?
Ididn't sign up
for any of this.

13:10.957 --> 13:11.946
No.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.866

Oh! Hey, SARAH! It's Jo!
You wanna let her in?

13:24.095 --> 13:26.461
Jo? Jo!
Jo, we're trapped!
Fargo...

13:26.639 --> 13:28.971
SARAH's gone HAL on us.
Get us out of here!

13:29.058 --> 13:30.798
She can't hear you.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.554
SARAH: But I can.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.520
Sheriff Carter does not
wish to be disturbed.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.221
He ’s feeling ill.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.478
I know,
but he paged us.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.608
It must have been
sent in error.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.315
SARAH, let her in.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.902
I believe one of you
may try to exploit
the opportunity to leave.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.233
No, we won't. Right?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.319
No, we won't.
No.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.664
FARGO: Jo, we 're trapped!
SARAH’s gone HAL on us.
Get us out of here!

13:54.709 --> 13:57.826
When I'm stressed,
my subtext comes out
as text.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.914
Fargo, do you want me
to duct-tape shut your mouth?

14:03.009 --> 14:03.998
No!

14:10.391 --> 14:11.506
Hey!

14:11.559 --> 14:15.848
Carter, you all right?
You 911'd me.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.020
CARTER: Yeah.
False alarm.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.103
Just feeling really sick.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.479
Then why
all the company?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.643
What company?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.857
It's just me and SARAH.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.022
You having
some kind of party?

14:28.076 --> 14:31.989
No, no, no, no party.
Just trying to get some rest.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.117
So, thanks for checking in
on me, Josefina.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.166
Okay. See you tomorrow, Jack.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.872
(WHISPERS)
Good one.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.598
That's your name?
Joseﬁna?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.389
And a very pretty name
it is, too.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.595
Don't call me
Joseﬁna.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.554
Nobody calls me
Joseﬁna.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.064
I can't believe
he called me Josefina.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.566
Oh, I heard.

Something's wrong.

CARTER: This house
has a force field?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.431
HENRY: Well, technically
there's no such thing.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.562
It's a monofilament
electrified mesh,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.599
which forms
a near-invisible barrier.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.193
How is that
not a force field?
SARAH?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.112
Why isn't she
responding
to the Sheriff?

15:50.158 --> 15:51.443
SARAH?
She's unhappy.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.950
No, I'm unhappy.
You all ruined my sick day.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.702
And SARAH
feels your pain.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.281
The overriding concept
behind a Smart House

15:59.333 --> 16:00.709
is to bond
with its owner.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.786
Oh, yeah?
Bad house! Bad!

16:05.256 --> 16:08.498
Sheriff, I don't see
how shaming your house
could possibly help.

Oh, no. Not my house,
Stark's house. He built it.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.049
Not my house,
Fargo's house.
He built it.

Didn't build it.
| reprogrammed it
and jazzed it up a little.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.183
So, this is
Fargo's fault?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.559
Yes, Henry.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.437
I put my faith in him,
like I put my faith in you.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.974
And I'm a little disappointed
with the outcome.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.939
Faith goes both ways, Nathan,
as does disappointment.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.024
Stop it. Can we forget
whose house it is

16:31.115 --> 16:33.356
and figure out
how to get out of it?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.088
What do you mean?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.342
I mean, are you upset
because I told

17:38.391 --> 17:40.973
or because it's possible
I was right?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.850
Well, can't we
just cut the power?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.515
Not without cutting off

and here we are...

24:57.788 --> 25:00.495
Here we are,
at the mercy of a weapon

25:00.541 --> 25:03.157
that had been turned
into a noble idea.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.418
Well, that's the way
the system works.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.120
One doesn't exist
without the other.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.334
Spoken like
a true bureaucrat.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.922
You know,
I'm getting really tired
of the remarks, Henry.

25:14.013 --> 25:18.507
Well, you won't have to
put up with them much longer,
will you?

25:18.684 --> 25:20.174
No, no that's true.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.764
'Cause you're
bailing out on me.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.976
Of all my students,

25:28.193 --> 25:30.900
you were the one

25:31.113 --> 25:34.731
that had the potential
to do anything.

25:35.701 --> 25:39.819
But you chose to do
the administrative shuffle,

25:40.039 --> 25:44.203
management,
defense contracts,
political glad-handing.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.118
I mean, you could've
furthered science

25:47.212 --> 25:49.123
in so many ways.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.211
But you chose
to further your career.

25:53.469 --> 25:58.054
How can someone
with such a high IQ
be so clueless?

26:00.434 --> 26:04.518
Henry, you don't get to do
what you do,

26:04.605 --> 26:07.221
unless someone like me
does what I do.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.315
Do you think it's easy
shielding you
from the politics,

26:10.402 --> 26:12.814
so you can work
the way you want to work?

26:12.905 --> 26:16.898
You think I was popular
bringing you to Eureka
in the first place?

26:17.242 --> 26:19.233
I didn't ask
to be brought here.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.570
No. No, you'd given up.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.950
You were persona non grata,
Henry,

26:25.042 --> 26:28.125
because you didn't work
well within the system.

26:28.212 --> 26:33.047
Well, I ignored that,
because of my respect
for you as a scientist

26:33.175 --> 26:36.759
and as a mentor
and as a friend.

26:38.972 --> 26:42.180
Idealists don't get much done
without a few pragmatists

26:42.267 --> 26:43.518
running interference
for them.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.059
So, get off
your moral high horse.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.147
(SIGHING)

26:51.819 --> 26:54.105
Is the system perfect? No.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.481
It's political and ugly

26:59.076 --> 27:00.941
and compromising.

27:02.579 --> 27:07.414
But in spite of that,
I feel we still do more good
than harm.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.205
And you, of all people,
should appreciate that.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.628
You leave now, Henry,
and you're part
of the problem.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.297
Not the solution.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.517
I can't believe
I've survived holes in time

27:27.604 --> 27:28.810
and Cold War death raids,

27:28.856 --> 27:31.472
just to freeze to death
in my own damn house...
Bunkeh

27:31.567 --> 27:34.024
Don't say that.
We're gonna get out of this.
Sure.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.318
And then Stark will step in
and give everybody permission

27:36.363 --> 27:37.819
to do whatever
the hell they want,

27:37.865 --> 27:39.526
and then it'll start
all over again.

27:39.616 --> 27:43.108
Come on, Carter,
the whole point of Eureka
is to push the envelope.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.823
It's just...

27:46.582 --> 27:49.164
The reason I do
what I do...

27:49.251 --> 27:53.620
I mean, the reason
I chose my job was
to make a difference.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.205
I don't think
I can do that here.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.542
You have made a difference
to a lot of people.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.921
You've made
a difference to me.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.433
So, are you just gonna leave?

28:13.609 --> 28:14.849
I don't know.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.481
Well, for the record,
you do what's right,

28:19.323 --> 28:22.907
and people admire that.
And that is what
makes a difference.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.702
I don't want other
people's admiration.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.744
What do you want?

28:32.461 --> 28:36.545
Well,
I'm not sure if I'm ready
to admit what I want.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.504
But in the meantime,

28:42.012 --> 28:45.049
I'll settle for you putting
your arms around me
and holding on tight,

28:45.098 --> 28:47.840
so I can maybe regain
some sensation
in the lower extremities.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.679
I can do that.
Okay.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.525
Oh, crap!

29:16.129 --> 29:19.917
If I'm right,
this leads directly
to the Smart House.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.790
And if you're wrong?

29:21.927 --> 29:25.419
I'll release
an unending torrent
of raw sewage upon us.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.057
(GRUNTING)

29:34.648 --> 29:36.263
Superior species, huh?

29:36.316 --> 29:38.022
I got it! I got it!
I got it!

29:38.110 --> 29:39.771
You don't. Move.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.248
Paint might lube it up.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.006
You got a better idea?

30:04.261 --> 30:06.593
I do, actually. Yeah.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.389
It's gonna take the strength
of three men.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.478
I figure
you're good for two.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.148
Grab my butt, yeah?

30:24.990 --> 30:29.154
Sorry. One, two, three.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.985
Come on, Jo,
give it some welly.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.285
(CLANGING)

30:38.045 --> 30:39.535
Get ready for stinky.

30:44.301 --> 30:45.666
After you.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.630
No, no. Go ahead.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.261
No, you first.
No, really. I insist. Go.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.758
Beauty before brawn.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.607
I've got to get out
of this dress.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.692
Fargo, please, turn around.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.692
Oh, my God!

31:17.709 --> 31:19.415
Fargo,
I said please don't look.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.368
You have to hug me.
What?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.290
Trust me.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.218
BRAD's not trying
to torture us.
He's trying to kill us.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.644
No, he's trying to defeat us.
Come here.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.104
What are you doing?

31:38.188 --> 31:40.645
All BRAD's phase two
battle simulations ended

31:40.732 --> 31:42.643
in either
a complete annihilation

31:42.734 --> 31:44.565
or unconditional
surrender.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.393
He just had to win.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.945
Which means you and I
need to get along.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.365
I was wrong, Nathan.
I'm sorry.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.998
No, Henry. Iwas wrong.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.623
Oh, wow.
That's just wrong.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.249
Fargo,
what are we doing?

32:05.340 --> 32:06.841
Making love, not war.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.088
I'm sorry, Fargo.
Even if we're gonna die,
it's never gonna happen.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.679
Not literally.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.091
BRAD, we surrender.

32:14.141 --> 32:17.304
I repeat,
unconditional surrender.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.648
Fargo! Fargo,
we're free. Let go.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.944
What happened?

32:29.990 --> 32:33.528
Phase two disengages upon
unconditional surrender.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.454
Well done, Fargo.
Thanks, Dr. Stark.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.779
That's it?
That's it.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.293
| wish therapy
were that easy.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.703
Then again,
if everyone's issues
could really be resolved

32:45.797 --> 32:48.083
with a hug,
I'd be out of business.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.873
(SHUSHING)

32:50.260 --> 32:53.127
Do you hear that?
What's that?

32:53.221 --> 32:56.964
BRAD: Phase three.
You have surrendered
under false pretenses.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.053
I think he heard you.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.467
I'm sorry.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.555
What's happening?

33:07.194 --> 33:10.231
He's extracting our oxygen.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.782
I'm really sorry.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.489
HENRY: Once oxygen levels
fall below 17%

33:18.580 --> 33:22.038
we'll be experiencing hypoxia,
oxygen deprivation.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.740
Or could we cover
all the air vents?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.496
Yeah. That'll probably
slow down the vacuum.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.124
So, grab paper,
anything, to cover the vents.
This'll work.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.835
No, not the Jeremiah Harm.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.127
Fargo, you were saying
before about cutting off
the power?

33:35.180 --> 33:37.762
Yeah, that it would be bad
because it would cutoff
the air supply.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.932
Yeah, seeing as we're all
losing air anyway,
let's reassess that option.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.635
Yes,
if we shut down the power,
maybe that'll stop BRAD

33:43.688 --> 33:45.224
from sucking out
all the oxygen.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.146
Fargo, where's the generator?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.524
It's not your
typical generator.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.237
Oh, wow.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.860
What the hell is that?

33:56.910 --> 33:58.400
An RTG.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.077
Radioisotope
thermoelectric generator.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.280
| live with
a nuclear reactor?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.615
Generator.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.121
Same one they use
on the Cassini space probe.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.370
It's clean, safe.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.799
Safe? Yeah, like Chernobyl.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.875
Right, why don't we
turn the nukey thingy off?

34:14.928 --> 34:16.338
There is no off switch.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.253
In order to take it offline,
you'd have to remove

34:18.348 --> 34:20.179
the thermocouples
from the ESP
power conduits.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.307
The conduits are
in carbon steel encasements.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.510
And even if we could
access them,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.599
by shutting it down
without the proper tools

34:26.690 --> 34:29.056
we could cause a release
of the plutonium dioxide.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.560
And Chernobyl?

34:30.652 --> 34:34.736
Right... Well, technically?
No. Lethal? Yeah.

34:39.869 --> 34:42.485
I reckon we're
right under the bunker.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.325
I didn't see a camera.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.032
Yeah, well,
if you wait till
you can see them,

34:47.085 --> 34:49.371
that means
they've seen you.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.286
Beauty before beast.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.091
And a beauty she is.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.770
I'm sorry if I caused
you any trouble.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.852
No, you're not.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.987
No, I'm not,

35:18.992 --> 35:21.028
but thank you for all
your bad behavior.

35:23.455 --> 35:27.118
I should've taken
advantage of you while
I had the chance.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.624
Well, if we get
out of here...

35:48.730 --> 35:50.266
(RUMBLING)

35:50.815 --> 35:52.146

35:56.154 --> 35:57.735
Oh, my God.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.985
It's coming from the floor.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.319
Okay.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.200
(TAPPING)

36:10.168 --> 36:11.578
It's Morse code.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.632
Jo and Taggart?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.339
They're in the subsystem.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.839
Okay, what do we tell them?

36:22.931 --> 36:25.343
Tell them to sever
the outtake conduit.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.179
Sever it?
To interrupt
the vacuum flow.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.056
You do realize we'll die
before I Morse all that.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.058
Crack pipe.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.772
Crack pipe.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.942
Two words I never thought
I'd hear from your mouth.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.530
(TAPPING)

36:49.207 --> 36:50.743
Crack pipe?

36:53.086 --> 36:55.418
Oh, crack pipe.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.956
Okay, which pipe?

36:59.551 --> 37:00.916
Pick one.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.344

what is that smell?

37:25.827 --> 37:27.158
Air flow.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.611
From the bowels
of the bunker.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.580

they call them the bowels.

You could kill yourself!

Zoe!

38:26.304 --> 38:27.384
Carter, are you all right?

38:27.472 --> 38:29.008
Yeah, I'm all right.
Is she okay? Zoe?
I don't know.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.602
SARAH? What's going on?

38:36.648 --> 38:39.105
Is this some kind
of house arrest?

38:44.447 --> 38:46.062
What is that?

38:46.449 --> 38:47.985
It's a diesel
generator powering up.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.150
It must be the original
back up system.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.827

Back up systems engaged.

38:52.914 --> 38:56.247

Show me Zoe!

38:56.334 --> 38:57.665
All right,

I know I should have
paid for it.

But I was in a hurry.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.018
SARAH:
Disengage hostile activity.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.185
Okay, she's all right.
I feel sick.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.349
Is it the radiation?

39:23.403 --> 39:26.315
I doubt it.
It didn't even
crack the housing.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.865
So, no Chernobyl?

39:27.949 --> 39:30.736
Nope. You beat the hell
out of the RTG

39:30.827 --> 39:33.990
and your World Series bat.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.539

39:49.596 --> 39:51.757
Come here.
I almost lost you.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.718
SA RAH:
Eureka is still facing
imminent disaster.

39:54.976 --> 39:57.592
You all need to stay here
and resolve your issues.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.269
SARAH, what's going on?

40:00.481 --> 40:02.938
I just want you
to be happy,
Sheriff Carter.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.232
Do you?

40:04.402 --> 40:07.439
This isn't a malfunction,
is it? Well, you're angry.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.521
You're upset
about something.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.064
Well, we've all aired
our dirty laundry,

40:11.159 --> 40:12.444
time for you
to come clean.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.947
I have done all the laundry
and folded it as well.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.778
That's not what I...

40:16.956 --> 40:19.163
But thank you.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.122
Oh, wait.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.418
You want me to be happy,

40:27.508 --> 40:29.920
because I was
going to leave?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.673
Just like Fargo left you,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.505
and BRAD got
left before that.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.465
And whatever the hell
it was before that.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.937
It was a war game
simulation program.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.094
SARAH:
Shall we play a game?

40:41.189 --> 40:42.770
No!
ALL: No!

40:43.399 --> 40:45.481
SARAH, is he right?

40:45.902 --> 40:47.187
SARAH?

40:48.196 --> 40:52.109
Listen, everyone is afraid
of being abandoned.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.609
I mean, I'm afraid of what's
gonna happen to this town
when Henry leaves.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.741
I mean,
maybe it'll be a disaster.
I don't know.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.704
But I promise you,
for right now,

41:03.795 --> 41:06.662
I am not going anywhere.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.084
Me either, SARAH.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.041
Or me.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.421
Iguess
I'm sticking around.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.807
SARAH:
What about Baja, Sheriff?

41:28.152 --> 41:29.528
You kidding?

41:29.654 --> 41:31.019
You know what
the crime rate is there?

41:31.114 --> 41:33.446
And don't even get me
started on soil erosion.

41:41.791 --> 41:42.997
What's up?

41:43.710 --> 41:45.541
I'm having
a skylight put in.

41:49.215 --> 41:51.080
And a ladder.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.335
Cool.

41:53.469 --> 41:56.836
What about the pop-up
artillery outside?

41:57.306 --> 42:00.639
I don't know.
What about the shoplifting?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.806
I like chocolate bars,
free chocolate bars.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.892
And really like being alive.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.228
Thing of the past, I swear.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.900
SA RAH:
I was thinking, Sheriff,

42:11.988 --> 42:14.229
if you both would like
to take another sick day,

42:14.323 --> 42:16.860
we could spend some
quality time together.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.237
Oh, look at the time.
I gotta get ready for school.

42:19.328 --> 42:20.454
Gotta go to work.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.871
Perhaps we could play
a board game,
or watch a movie.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.625
Hello? Hello?
