WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:05.506
Find redemption, brothers and sisters.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.551
We wait for everything
to go back to normal,

00:09.635 --> 00:11.803
when we have never known normal.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.766
If the world ends tomorrow,

00:15.849 --> 00:19.728
will you be one of those who waits
for a proclamation to free you?

00:19.811 --> 00:23.065
Emancipate your voice!
Emancipate your soul.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.858
The end of the world is upon us.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.693
You guys set for school?

00:26.777 --> 00:28.403
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.573
Jace, is this new tablet the school
sent over working any better for you?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.701
Yes.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.037
Good, 'cause we don't need you
falling behind.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.164
-I gotta go…
-Have a good day, Mom.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.249
Yeah, you too.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.044
Be careful out there.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.963
Thank you. Bye, baby.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.634
Okay, I need to show you something.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.346
I start school in ten minutes,
so hurry up.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.432
I got a letter from our dad yesterday.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
What?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.854
I told you I was gonna write him,
and I did.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.276
So what's it say?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.612
I couldn't get past the picture.

01:26.044 --> 01:30.257
"Dear Jackie,
Sorry it took me so long to respond.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.468
I was surprised to hear from you.
How are you?

01:33.552 --> 01:37.264
I can only imagine how big you guys
have gotten since I last saw you.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.184
I'm glad to hear
your brother's doing well.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.397
And I'm sorry I haven't been around.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.234
I just didn't know
how to get back in your lives.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.153
But I think about you a lot.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.157
I wonder what you're doing,

01:56.074 --> 01:57.576
what music you listen to.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.454
I know your mom's got you on that go-go."

02:02.206 --> 02:04.458
"When things didn't work out
with your moms,

02:04.541 --> 02:08.044
I went to Florida to visit a cousin
and never left.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.089
I started over and had another…"

02:16.345 --> 02:18.430
And what? What, Jace?

02:25.687 --> 02:27.147
"And had another daughter.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.948
She's five years younger
than Jace and kind of favors him.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.326
Maybe you'll meet her one day.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.538
I wish things were different.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.085
But just know I love you, and Jace too.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.964
Sincerely, your father, Grant Carson."

02:53.006 --> 02:54.800
I just had to track him down, and…

02:56.093 --> 02:58.303
and all this time he's raising
another daughter?

02:58.387 --> 02:59.638
He's full of shit.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.267
So let's tell him. Both of us.
We can write him back together.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.978
Nah, Jack. No more letter writing.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.730
He needs to see us face-to-face.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.858
Okay, well,
how are we supposed to do that?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.110
I have class.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.156
Yeah.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.162
Hey, Musa.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.874
Queen Tamika.
I gotta talk some sense into you.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.001
Are you really goin' back
to in-person school?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.086
Yes.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.297
Why? They're giving us
a choice to do it online.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.092
Yeah, I know, but both my parents work,

05:00.175 --> 05:02.135
and I don't think
they want me home alone all day.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.929
And plus, I'm bored as hell.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.306
I mean, bored is my new normal.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.560
Are you busy Saturday night?

05:10.561 --> 05:11.562
Saturday?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
No.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.775
'Cause my family's inviting you
to have dinner with us.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.735
Really?

05:19.319 --> 05:22.531
I mean, I don't think I'm ready
to get back on a plane.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.741
I know.
You'll be our virtual dinner guest.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.369
But if you're too busy
being bored and all, then…

05:28.161 --> 05:31.665
No, no. I'm not.
I accept. Thank you.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.751
Good. All right. I have to go.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.879
But Saturday night,
five o'clock your time.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.797
All right. It's a date.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.674
Okay.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.427
I mean… I'll be there.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.596
Bye.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.059
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey.

05:51.143 --> 05:56.023
In this next equation, XY plus 2X minus Y,

05:56.106 --> 05:59.735
if Y equals four, solve for X.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.862
Now, which one of you young ladies
and gentlemen

06:01.945 --> 06:03.864
would like to solve this next equation?

06:04.448 --> 06:08.202
If X equals 16, and Y equals two…

06:20.088 --> 06:22.299
I see they finally stopped
the mass incarceration

06:22.382 --> 06:23.926
of basketball courts in the area.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.139
Said you wanted to talk?

06:32.351 --> 06:34.436
Okay. How about I go first?

06:36.647 --> 06:40.692
I lost it the last time we spoke,
and I'm sorry.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.738
What happened at State
13 years ago is complicated.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.740
Save it for somebody who gives a damn.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.326
All right.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.411
Then what am I here for?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.164
I made a commitment to my team
and to myself.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.832
We actually wanna be champions.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.752
And as much as I'm down
to walk out on you,

06:58.836 --> 07:00.796
I'm not gonna walk out on them.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.923
So I'll listen to your X's and O's,

07:03.632 --> 07:04.800
but that's it.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.388
Just X's and O's?
That's not your game, kid.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.472
What?

07:10.556 --> 07:12.850
Playin' with anger?
It's not how you built.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.852
Some guys, yeah.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.646
But you, you need to play for love.
You ain't learn that yet?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.106
Give me the damn ball.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.824
See? Caught up in your emotions.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.285
I'm not built like that either.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.580
I tried to be what you tryna be.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.208
Angry on the court and angry at the world.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.252
But it didn't work.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.920
It didn't work 'cause you full of shit!

07:46.175 --> 07:48.051
You know, my eyes are open now.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.555
You're a 24-hour person
when it's convenient.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.182
No better than my father.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.645
You hardly talk about your pops.
But I'm here.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.439
As far as I can tell, he isn't.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.357
So when you done being pissed…

08:03.317 --> 08:04.318
Done?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.697
You really do think
you know how I'm built.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.578
That's how I'm built.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.836
"H."

08:23.879 --> 08:27.257
You think I still care about your
"love of the game" life-lessons bullshit?

08:29.468 --> 08:32.179
I think you hurt. I think you scared.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.475
"H-O." Scared? Scared of what?

08:36.558 --> 08:37.934
That you can't trust me.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.561
Why would I trust you?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.523
I know what it's like to be let down.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.068
I don't worry about being let down.
You know why? 'Cause I got myself.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.698
"H-O-R." You wanna keep losing?

08:55.536 --> 08:56.537
Shit!

09:00.832 --> 09:01.834
Damn.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.671
Game.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.757
-Run it back.
-No second chances.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.850
We got G-Dubs comin' up on the schedule.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.146
They beat us in the regular season,
and we split with Dominion Ballers.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.776
We can't run the table with these teams
if you and I don't get past our stuff.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.778
I am past it, Coach.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.197
You just gotta do your job.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.996
Did you-- You tell anybody about…

09:39.079 --> 09:41.748
Nah. Can't have them knowing you're trash.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.418
I need them focused.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.920
All right.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.506
Just X's and O's.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.146
Let's go, Jace!

10:08.233 --> 10:09.318
Let's go, G-Dubs!

10:26.418 --> 10:27.544
What is that?

10:57.366 --> 10:58.909
G-Dub. G-Dub.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.789
Yo, lucky win, Big Dawg.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.791
Oh, yeah? So skill ain't had
nothin' to do with it?

11:05.874 --> 11:07.459
Just a little. Just a little.

11:07.543 --> 11:10.879
Coming from you, that's the greatest
compliment in the history of the game.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.465
But for real though,
I'm rooting for y'all.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.175
Yeah, right!

11:15.259 --> 11:17.302
The world is different now, Big Dawg.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.138
How I'ma have the world change
and I don't change? You feel me?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.642
-I feel that. That's real.
-Come on.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.435
-I'll see y'all next year.
-All right, Pip.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.188
All righty. Let's go, G-Dub!

11:28.272 --> 11:29.898
Yeah!

11:29.982 --> 11:34.736
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:43.453 --> 11:44.621
Oh, what--

11:46.123 --> 11:47.249
What?

11:47.332 --> 11:48.333
Nothin'.

11:49.251 --> 11:53.463
I just don't understand why
you keep trying to attack the zone.

11:54.882 --> 11:59.344
I'm not "trying" to attack the zone.
I'm scoring at will.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.640
These things are hard to breathe in.
Do you mind?

12:03.724 --> 12:04.766
Go ahead.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.940
You got a floor full of open shooters.

12:12.024 --> 12:14.359
Shooters? Are you crazy?
Those girls sucked.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.695
Well, how they gonna get better
if you don't trust 'em?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.822
It's a selfish way to play.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.909
Yeah, well, I scored 30, and we won.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.453
Scoring's just one element to the game.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.249
In the huddle, my coach would say,
"Get the ball to Meg."

12:29.333 --> 12:31.376
She didn't say that so that I could pass.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.463
How far did you get in the playoffs
with that dumbass philosophy?

12:34.546 --> 12:40.135
I mean, I got a scholarship to Syracuse,
so must have been doing something right.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.221
Did you pass the ball at Syracuse?

12:42.763 --> 12:45.057
You mean you didn't have your friends
tape those games too?

12:48.894 --> 12:52.272
I led my team in assists my senior year.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.442
But who's keeping track?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.577
When do you start back up with your chemo?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.957
It doesn't sound like it's gonna do me
a whole lotta good.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.966
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:23.512 --> 13:24.888
I had a hell of a run.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.809
I don't-- I don't need sympathy.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.274
And I have to be honest with you. I--

13:37.276 --> 13:39.361
I don't have it in me to watch you…

13:41.864 --> 13:42.948
leave.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.081
Baby girl, I'm not asking you
to be there when I die.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.458
That's not why I'm here.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.131
So why don't you just go ahead
and fast-forward that thing

13:59.214 --> 14:00.716
to another one of your games.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.648
Okay.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.942
Okay, I see you.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.694
You feelin' it? Like…

14:20.777 --> 14:22.821
Yeah! Yeah, I do.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.200
So, what do I say
to get on her parents' good side?

14:26.283 --> 14:29.536
Son, all you gotta do is tell 'em that you
don't believe in premarital sex,

14:29.620 --> 14:30.704
and they will love you.

14:30.787 --> 14:34.416
Oh, my gosh. Dad,
can you please be serious?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.462
Okay. Okay…

14:39.963 --> 14:42.674
Listen, you've already
got the good manners

14:42.758 --> 14:46.803
and the, you know, "sir," "ma'am,"
"thank you," "please,"

14:46.887 --> 14:48.764
all of that good stuff. Right?

14:48.847 --> 14:49.973
Okay.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.352
Ask about their lives, their interests.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.896
A little secret for you.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.274
The more you get people talking
about their thing,

14:59.358 --> 15:01.610
the better conversationalist
they think you are.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.819
Okay.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.530
How was your day?

15:05.155 --> 15:07.866
The lieutenant was wandering
the halls with overtime in his eyes.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.118
Glad I made it out of there in time.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.288
So, where do you work, Mr. Johnson?

15:13.372 --> 15:15.332
Seat Pleasant Police Department.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.085
Yeah, my dad's a violent crimes detective.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.420
That's pretty interesting.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.422
So you did that back in Oakland too?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.132
Fifteen years.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.301
I thought coming to Maryland
would be a slower pace,

15:26.385 --> 15:28.679
but this town's been keeping me busy.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.514
Especially these last few months.

15:30.597 --> 15:35.310
Yeah. Before the lockdown and protesting,
Leon was working the Joe Warrick case.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.438
You probably heard about him.
He was a basketball coach.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.608
Yeah. Yeah, I…
I think I heard something about that.

15:41.692 --> 15:45.612
Girls basketball coach got jumped
by four other guys in masks.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.698
We assumed it was a botched robbery.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.950
But now we know there was more to it.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.743
Really?

15:51.827 --> 15:53.871
You know, if you ask me,
the guy was a creep,

15:53.954 --> 15:56.415
but he still was a victim
of a violent crime.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.834
Can't really talk about the case,

15:58.917 --> 16:01.003
but there's been some
interesting developments.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.672
It's an interesting puzzle.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.299
What kind of interesting developments?

16:05.382 --> 16:06.550
You think I asked?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.635
I just pretended not to know
much about the case.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.721
Moose, you gotta stop talking
to Tamika, bro.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.055
-Exactly.
-What?

16:12.139 --> 16:13.682
If you slip up and say the wrong thing--

16:13.765 --> 16:15.976
-I won't.
-Sure, you won't.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.228
-Shit.
-What up?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.314
Here they go, in our business.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.524
All right, listen. For all we know,

16:22.608 --> 16:24.443
the reason she invited you
to have dinner with them

16:24.526 --> 16:26.028
is so her dad could scope you out.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.780
That's crazy, all right?
And anyway, if I just start ignoring her,

16:28.864 --> 16:31.575
-that can be even more suspicious.
-Yo, honestly?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.243
I'm too stressed to be dealing with this.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.246
Look, my mom's in jail,
and I'm not tryna end up there too.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.832
You're not goin' to jail. None of us are.

16:41.293 --> 16:44.379
Musa, you just gotta act normal.
All right?

16:44.463 --> 16:47.049
We're all gonna act normal.
And stay focused.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.843
We still got games to win.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.263
-Bring it in!
-All right?

16:53.347 --> 16:55.224
-I'll catch you later, bro.
-All right.

16:56.725 --> 17:00.229
Everybody in our division
is talkin' about us.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.648
Am I lying, Coach?

17:02.731 --> 17:03.982
No, you ain't lying.

17:05.317 --> 17:09.780
Opposing coaches
are recording our games now.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.073
That's facts.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.951
So we're gonna add a couple of plays,

17:14.034 --> 17:17.496
keep our offense fresh,
shake things up a bit.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.664
Yes?

17:19.665 --> 17:22.334
Just because the opposing coaches
know what we're gonna do,

17:22.416 --> 17:24.002
doesn't mean they can stop us.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.093
Like I said,

17:32.344 --> 17:33.887
we're gonna add a couple of plays.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.181
Baseline.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.897
Yeah, Jace. Right here.

17:45.774 --> 17:46.942
Hit me. Hit me.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.154
You hit that, Royale!

17:53.240 --> 17:56.243
Royale! Hold your follow-through!

17:59.955 --> 18:02.374
All right. We'll keep working on that one.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.710
-Let's move on.
-Ricky.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.421
-Phil! I want you down low.
-Yes, Coach?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.341
So, what's therapy like?

18:12.176 --> 18:17.181
She just asks a lot of questions.
And I just talk, basically.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.975
She's happy I'm back on the court.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.476
Aren't we all?

18:23.562 --> 18:24.646
I told her about you.

18:25.731 --> 18:26.732
What did you say?

18:27.566 --> 18:30.277
I said we're best friends
and that you always have my back.

18:33.322 --> 18:34.865
And she said I should tell you something.

18:35.699 --> 18:36.700
What?

18:38.035 --> 18:40.579
I appreciate your support and all.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.415
But I don't always wanna talk about this.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.377
So, let's change subjects.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.296
I feel you.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.633
So what's going on with you and Coach?

18:57.888 --> 18:59.515
We had a few words last week.

19:03.644 --> 19:04.937
Think we can keep winning?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.605
We have to.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.025
Feels like the only way
to make things right.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.027
Make what right?

19:17.699 --> 19:21.787
Jackie found out
that our father's living in Florida.

19:21.870 --> 19:22.955
What?

19:25.707 --> 19:27.167
I want him to see me play.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.671
I want him to know what he left behind.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.633
I feel like that's all I care about
right now.

19:35.968 --> 19:38.262
Not all, but… you know.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.267
Yeah, I do.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.687
So let's keep winning.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.606
Especially since you 'bout to lose
right now.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.151
You might be a little too confident.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.619
Overrated.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.761
Overrated.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.408
Please remove any keys, metal objects.
Place 'em in the bowl.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.498
Step on through.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.786
I see you're still keepin' your locs up.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.120
Yeah.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.539
Are you eating well?

21:29.498 --> 21:32.000
Now, you know you can't live off
wings and mumbo sauce, baby.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.377
I can't?

21:34.378 --> 21:38.173
I'm playin'. I still get to the carryout,
but Coach Ike and Miss Tonya,

21:38.257 --> 21:40.133
they make sure I eat right.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.719
I even made them breakfast this morning.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.721
Eggs, just like you taught me.

21:45.681 --> 21:46.932
There you go.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.311
You're doing okay, Mom?

21:52.354 --> 21:53.355
I'm fine.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.276
You know, you lookin' more and more
like your father.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.947
You know, when you was born, he
wouldn't put you down, he was so proud.

22:08.245 --> 22:11.456
You know, when Miss Tonya told me
the way he'd been treatin' you…

22:13.667 --> 22:15.335
I was just so angry.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.130
I wasn't there to protect you.

22:18.213 --> 22:22.301
I think Dad was beating me like that
because he thought he was protecting me.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.219
That's the crazy part.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.140
The way that man kept you
from visiting me, I just…

22:32.561 --> 22:33.812
Have you heard from him?

22:34.855 --> 22:35.981
Told him not to call.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.526
But he's still in that program
to help him with his issues.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.905
Have you heard anything
about your release?

22:42.988 --> 22:45.616
Yeah. My lawyers,
they workin' with Miss Tonya

22:45.699 --> 22:47.201
to get me a new parole hearing.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.952
And then you can come home?

22:49.036 --> 22:53.040
Well, I may have to go
to a halfway house just at first.

22:53.123 --> 22:56.376
They just wanna make sure I'm not
falling back into my old habits.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.713
But I'd still be able to see you
every day.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.591
So let's just keep the faith.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.426
I pray for you every day, Mama.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.387
I know you do.

23:07.471 --> 23:10.307
I'm gonna dedicate
the rest of my games to you.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.685
I am always there with you, baby.

23:17.064 --> 23:19.066
-Love you, Mama.
-Time's up, Keisha.

23:20.359 --> 23:21.610
I love you too.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.635
Phil?

23:50.389 --> 23:53.433
She still thinks that it was my father
that kept me from seein' her.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.104
But it was me.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.984
It's okay. It's okay.
Come here. Come here.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.570
I didn't wanna see her in that place.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.530
It's okay.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.956
Let's go. Let's go.

24:16.874 --> 24:17.916
Yeah. Get it. Get it.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.170
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, go.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.384
Yeah, yeah. Swing! Swing it!

24:28.677 --> 24:30.053
-Communicate!
-Move, move, move!

24:30.137 --> 24:32.806
Throw it in. Take it. Yeah.

24:32.890 --> 24:35.642
Yeah, make a move. Good! Yeah.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.936
What are we doin'? Talk to each other!

24:40.814 --> 24:42.691
Switch! Switch!

24:43.150 --> 24:44.151
Come on!

24:45.819 --> 24:46.987
Nice!

24:47.070 --> 24:48.906
Time-out! Time-out!

24:51.992 --> 24:54.369
To the bench. Bring it in.

24:54.453 --> 24:57.873
-Hey, Jace.
-Hey, it's all in your head, bro. Come on.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.044
Hey, yo. You good?

25:02.127 --> 25:03.128
No doubt.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.635
You guys are thinking about
the last time we faced them.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.261
How much it hurt?

25:11.345 --> 25:12.721
So am I.

25:12.804 --> 25:13.805
Coach…

25:13.889 --> 25:16.350
We need composure. All right?

25:16.433 --> 25:18.477
-No losing defensive assignments.
-But Coach.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.896
-What?
-We got this.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.612
-Let's go.
-All right.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.448
Let me know that. Lead us out.

25:31.949 --> 25:34.409
-Swagger on three! One, two, three…
-Swagger!

25:34.493 --> 25:35.744
Let's go!

25:38.247 --> 25:40.207
-I got you.
-Be strong with the ball.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.546
-All right.
-Attack him.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.803
Give 'em a little cushion.
Give 'em a little cushion!

25:52.886 --> 25:54.096
D up!

25:57.391 --> 25:58.684
Let's go, Nick! In!

26:07.192 --> 26:08.485
My bad.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.535
Your bad.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.915
-Yeah, let's go!
-Out of control. Thirteen, offense.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.545
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!

26:26.628 --> 26:28.130
Stay down. Stay down and play.

26:29.965 --> 26:32.176
Get him! Get him! Good D!

26:35.971 --> 26:37.306
Yeah!

26:40.267 --> 26:43.228
That's how we do. That's how we do.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.701
Her dad watched the livestream.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.495
He started asking some things
about Crystal.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.957
I just said I don't really know her,
and as far as I know,

27:04.041 --> 27:06.126
she just rolled up for a tryout
to get on the team.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.796
Bro, you gotta stop kicking it with her.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.256
I like her.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.674
Enough to end up in jail?

27:12.758 --> 27:14.801
You're the one who said
nobody was going to jail.

27:14.885 --> 27:19.139
We're not. But, if nothing else,
it's becoming a distraction.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.225
Look, you gotta handle this, Moose.

27:21.892 --> 27:23.602
I know. I know.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.562
I will.

27:25.646 --> 27:26.688
Better.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.775
-Oh, yo, what's up?
-Yo.

27:29.858 --> 27:32.402
Nothin'. We just kicking it with Musa.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.404
-Hey, what's up, Musa?
-Yo, what's good, Royale?

27:34.488 --> 27:37.074
Hey, another win. Feeling good. Yes, sir.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.286
Just wondering
when y'all gonna tell us what's going on.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.873
-What?
-What-- Whatcha mean?

27:45.666 --> 27:47.668
Y'all are always sneaking around.

27:47.751 --> 27:50.212
Whispering. Calling up Musa.

27:51.505 --> 27:52.714
How come?

27:53.799 --> 27:57.010
He's just been having some trouble
with this pandemic stuff, you know?

27:57.094 --> 27:58.178
-Right.
-Exactly.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.305
And we've just been helping him out.

28:00.389 --> 28:03.183
Yeah, man. Look, I been going crazy
staying in the house 24/7.

28:03.934 --> 28:04.935
That's it?

28:05.978 --> 28:08.522
-Yeah, that's it. What y'all got going on?
-That's it.

28:11.650 --> 28:13.819
We're family. Right?

28:13.902 --> 28:15.195
No doubt.

28:18.073 --> 28:21.076
Yo, Moose, I'ma hit you later, aight?

28:21.159 --> 28:22.661
Aight, fam.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.787
-All right.
-Catch you, Moose.

28:23.871 --> 28:25.581
-Chat to you later.
-All right, bro.

28:35.924 --> 28:37.759
-Thank you for making time.
-So?

28:39.303 --> 28:41.805
Just came by to check in and…

28:42.514 --> 28:45.851
You really told my kid you could give
a shit about what he thinks about you?

28:47.895 --> 28:51.273
You're a fraud, Ike.
I stopped caring what you got to say.

28:53.442 --> 28:55.944
We play the Maryland Prodigies
in the Regional Championship.

28:56.028 --> 28:57.404
I'm aware of that.

28:57.487 --> 28:58.947
They're coached by Deandre Wilson.

28:59.031 --> 29:02.492
Same coach that Jace faced
in our first game with each other.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.578
You mean the same coach you punched.

29:06.622 --> 29:09.041
Jace is not the same player.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.753
You, on the other hand, I hope you
manage not to end up behind bars again.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.880
Deandre's gonna try to push his buttons.

29:17.216 --> 29:20.135
And he's not gonna stop until he finds
a way to get underneath Jace's skin.

29:20.219 --> 29:21.762
And when that happens,

29:22.346 --> 29:24.598
I'm hoping you can remind him
to be a leader.

29:25.891 --> 29:27.643
And not to take it personal.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.561
Why do you care so much?

29:31.647 --> 29:34.608
If Jace can overcome the mental,
he can overcome anything.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.277
I believe that.

29:38.153 --> 29:42.241
So you just come here to be charitable?
Championship means nothing to you?

29:42.324 --> 29:43.700
It means a great deal to me…

29:44.993 --> 29:46.161
and to the program.

29:46.245 --> 29:48.413
You could probably quit
the hardware store.

29:49.331 --> 29:51.124
I'd probably be able to.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.462
That's the most honest thing
I've ever heard you say.

29:58.924 --> 30:00.008
Have a good day.

30:00.592 --> 30:01.760
You too.

30:05.973 --> 30:12.980
Swagger! Swagger!

30:13.063 --> 30:16.275
Swagger! Swagger!

30:16.900 --> 30:19.653
-Swagger!
-Swagger! Swagger!

30:19.736 --> 30:22.489
This is everything we've worked for.

30:22.573 --> 30:26.410
Every drop of sweat in that pool
was for this moment.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.705
Don't let anyone take it from you.
Y'all with me?

30:29.788 --> 30:30.873
Yes, Coach.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.749
-Are y'all with me?
-Yes, Coach!

30:32.833 --> 30:35.002
Then let's go! Nick, take us out.

30:35.085 --> 30:36.378
Swagger!

30:37.754 --> 30:39.506
The Fam on me. The Fam on three.

30:39.590 --> 30:40.924
-One, two, three!
-Fam!

30:41.466 --> 30:42.676
Come on, now!

30:42.759 --> 30:44.595
-One, two, three!
-Disrespectful!

30:44.678 --> 30:46.054
That's right! Let's go!

30:46.138 --> 30:48.974
Let's go, Swagger. Let's go!

30:50.058 --> 30:51.268
Yeah!

30:51.935 --> 30:52.936
Let's go, Phil!

30:56.648 --> 30:58.025
He overrated. Let's go.

31:04.323 --> 31:05.490
Oh, yeah!

31:06.867 --> 31:09.620
Yeah! That's what I love.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.663
Get back! Hustle back!

31:11.747 --> 31:14.291
Defense! Defense!

31:14.374 --> 31:15.834
Defense!

31:18.754 --> 31:21.632
Let's go! You overrated.
Put that pressure. You don't want it?

31:25.886 --> 31:28.263
Move with him. No! No! No!

31:29.598 --> 31:32.100
That's what I like! Come on, now.

31:32.184 --> 31:34.144
Yeah! Get back. Get back.

31:37.397 --> 31:41.109
There you go. Yeah. Move up, move up.

31:41.193 --> 31:44.071
D! D! D!

31:45.405 --> 31:47.991
He overrated. He got no jumper!

31:48.075 --> 31:49.868
Make him shoot from three!

31:49.952 --> 31:51.453
He still overrated.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.793
Oh, yeah!

31:58.377 --> 32:00.462
You overrated!
Everything you got, bring it!

32:02.130 --> 32:03.841
Don't worry about him. Get back!

32:13.892 --> 32:15.769
Let's go!

32:15.853 --> 32:18.689
Yes, that's it! That's it!

32:21.692 --> 32:23.151
Hey, Ref, watch the push!

32:23.235 --> 32:24.611
Ref! Call that, Ref!

32:24.695 --> 32:27.573
Weight room, young lady. Weight room.

32:27.656 --> 32:29.199
Fight through it!

32:40.752 --> 32:42.713
Hey! Are you crazy?

32:47.176 --> 32:48.677
Uh-uh, that's a foul, Ref.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.430
-Jace. Chill out, bro.
-You gonna get knocked out, bro!

32:51.513 --> 32:53.348
-Jace, stop!
-You gonna get knocked out, bro!

32:53.432 --> 32:55.434
I can handle myself.
You need to chill out.

32:55.517 --> 32:58.020
-I'm not gonna let them do you like that.
-Are you even hearing me?

32:58.770 --> 33:00.480
Time-out! Time-out!

33:00.564 --> 33:01.565
Hello?

33:02.858 --> 33:04.484
Trouble in paradise.

33:10.574 --> 33:13.243
Hey, my dad's in the ICU. I gotta go.

33:13.327 --> 33:14.578
For sure. Go.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.373
Y'all gotta relax. Come on.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.209
Hey, hey, hey! Come here. Come here.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.085
-No--
-No, listen to me!

33:22.169 --> 33:24.129
Don't let anyone take this moment
from you.

33:24.213 --> 33:26.381
-I'm not!
-Hey! Shut up and listen.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.343
-Why you think he going after Crystal?
-'Cause he's a bitch.

33:29.426 --> 33:31.220
But why you think he going after her?

33:33.847 --> 33:35.474
'Cause he sees it pissing me off.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.352
This is your moment.

33:39.353 --> 33:42.105
Not his. Not mine. Yours.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.359
Act like it, Jace.

33:46.944 --> 33:47.945
Come on.

33:50.781 --> 33:52.991
You gotta play your game now, Jace.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.712
Come on!

34:21.728 --> 34:22.813
Come on!

34:22.896 --> 34:24.273
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.733
Ref! That's a flagrant!

34:29.652 --> 34:31.362
Get his ass outta here!

34:32.239 --> 34:34.908
Get back. You stupid-ass boy.

34:34.992 --> 34:36.201
Hey, hey, hey!

34:37.828 --> 34:39.454
-We're here with you.
-Jace, you all right?

34:39.538 --> 34:41.998
Watch out. Watch out.
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

34:45.210 --> 34:48.088
Mom. Mom. They've got it.

34:48.630 --> 34:51.800
Phil. Drew. We gotta get him up. Slowly.

34:51.884 --> 34:53.342
You're gonna be all right.

34:53.427 --> 34:55.637
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.015
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

35:01.268 --> 35:02.895
-I'm good.
-Take him to the bench.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.688
-I'm not coming out this game.
-To the bench.

35:05.564 --> 35:06.940
I'll get him some ice.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.700
Bring him here.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.914
Take it easy. Take it easy.

35:22.623 --> 35:23.624
Look at me.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.127
-Hey, Coach, I can play. I'm good.
-Relax.

35:27.211 --> 35:28.837
I'm not coming out this game.

35:32.508 --> 35:33.842
Royale, sub in.

35:45.145 --> 35:47.773
Listen. We still got a game to win.

35:49.525 --> 35:52.277
So the rest of y'all, pick your heads up,
and let's go.

35:52.861 --> 35:53.862
Come on.

36:07.584 --> 36:10.420
Defense! Defense!

36:11.046 --> 36:12.297
Defense!

36:12.381 --> 36:13.924
Defense!

36:14.007 --> 36:15.133
Defense!

36:15.676 --> 36:17.094
Defense!

36:18.846 --> 36:19.847
Stay on him!

36:21.014 --> 36:22.808
Royale! Watch the screen, Royale!

36:23.892 --> 36:25.143
Yeah!

36:25.227 --> 36:26.228
Let's go!

36:26.311 --> 36:27.771
Yeah!

36:28.605 --> 36:30.607
That's my boy!

37:16.695 --> 37:20.240
All right. They're gonna double-team Nick.

37:20.324 --> 37:21.617
This is what we want.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.118
We're gonna run Indiana.

37:23.202 --> 37:25.746
Drew, you come around. You get open.

37:25.829 --> 37:28.707
Nick, kick him the ball.
And Drew, you let it fly.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.878
We're not going for the tie.
We're going for the win.

37:32.961 --> 37:36.381
Y'all execute this well,
and we're DMV champs.

37:37.007 --> 37:41.094
No matter the outcome,
y'all leave it all out on this floor.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.225
Jace, you wanna take us out?

37:47.684 --> 37:48.852
Let's get it.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.025
Win on me. Win on three.

37:55.108 --> 37:57.361
-One, two, three!
-Win it!

37:57.444 --> 37:58.987
Let's go!

37:59.071 --> 38:01.114
Let's go, Ricky. Eyes up!

38:01.198 --> 38:02.824
Come on, Swagger!

38:02.908 --> 38:05.494
All right, Swagger! Stay on 'em, Royale!

38:08.914 --> 38:10.207
Go through. Go through.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.751
Drew!

38:12.835 --> 38:14.211
Right here! Right here!

38:23.595 --> 38:27.641
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go!

38:38.068 --> 38:39.611
There you go. Good job, son.

38:39.695 --> 38:42.614
Yeah! Yeah!

38:51.248 --> 38:52.708
Yeah!

39:05.929 --> 39:07.931
-Careful.
-Almost there.

39:11.435 --> 39:13.437
Okay. Got it?

39:15.856 --> 39:17.149
Come on.

39:23.989 --> 39:25.032
Excuse me, Jenna?

39:25.574 --> 39:28.619
I'd like to introduce Alonzo Powers
with Gladiator Sneakers.

39:28.702 --> 39:29.786
Hello.

39:29.870 --> 39:32.080
Hey. It's good to meet you.

39:33.040 --> 39:36.210
You have a hell of a son there,
and I would just like to offer my help.

39:37.586 --> 39:39.213
Okay. How?

39:40.130 --> 39:42.341
Well, I was telling Ike
that I'm really good friends

39:42.424 --> 39:44.384
with one of the best orthopedists
in the area.

39:44.885 --> 39:46.386
She could take Jace right away.

39:47.638 --> 39:49.515
-If she's out-of-network…
-Nope.

39:49.598 --> 39:52.434
It's just a favor. No bill attached.
Trust me.

39:53.602 --> 39:55.854
Seriously.
I brought her a lot of patients.

39:55.938 --> 39:58.023
She owes me. She'd be happy to help.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.359
For real, Ma, I'm all good.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.611
It'd be good to make sure.

40:05.364 --> 40:07.574
I would appreciate it. Thanks.

40:07.658 --> 40:09.076
Of course.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.078
-Hello, everyone.
-Hey.

40:11.161 --> 40:13.288
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

40:13.372 --> 40:17.292
So, the good news is
there are no tears or breaks.

40:17.376 --> 40:18.544
Told you, Ma.

40:18.627 --> 40:20.671
As I said, that's the good news.

40:20.754 --> 40:24.508
The bad news is I'm fairly certain
you suffered an MCL sprain.

40:24.591 --> 40:26.593
However, we'll need to take an MRI
to confirm it.

40:26.677 --> 40:29.012
A sprain? That doesn't sound too bad.

40:29.096 --> 40:31.473
It definitely could have been a lot worse.
But if I'm right,

40:31.557 --> 40:34.101
he'll need to stay off of that leg
for at least six weeks.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.729
I can't be out that long.
Nationals are in three weeks.

40:37.813 --> 40:40.816
I've seen some athletes heal faster,
but I've also seen some

40:40.899 --> 40:42.985
do more damage
because they went back too soon.

40:43.068 --> 40:46.280
But you could be wrong, right?
I could be fine by three weeks.

40:46.363 --> 40:48.907
-Jace.
-I would love to be wrong.

40:48.991 --> 40:50.534
Let's just see what the MRI tells us.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.997
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.840
So they tell me
you might be able to hear me.

41:09.761 --> 41:10.929
I think you can.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.728
I know I told you
that I didn't wanna be here.

41:19.104 --> 41:24.067
And that was because I didn't
wanna feel what I feel now.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.616
Which is that I'm angry.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.538
I'm angry at you.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.470
Because I love you.

41:52.179 --> 41:54.681
And I don't wanna miss you all over again.

42:00.729 --> 42:04.316
Even though you didn't come to my games,
I imagined you were there.

42:06.527 --> 42:08.195
I played for you,

42:08.278 --> 42:11.114
because all I ever wanted
was for you to be proud of me.

42:14.201 --> 42:17.079
And when I thought you weren't,
I didn't want anything to do with you.

42:26.129 --> 42:27.840
But if you can hear me…

42:30.759 --> 42:31.969
I'm here.

42:45.732 --> 42:47.317
Your baby girl is here.

42:54.908 --> 42:55.909
Daddy?

43:01.915 --> 43:04.334
Help! Somebody help!

43:10.799 --> 43:13.969
Meg, can you wait outside, please?

44:23.997 --> 44:25.082
You okay?

44:27.042 --> 44:28.836
Yeah. Tired.

44:29.253 --> 44:30.337
Right.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.345
To Frank Bailey.

44:39.638 --> 44:40.973
Coach and father.

44:42.266 --> 44:43.684
May he rest in peace.

44:54.069 --> 44:55.946
I wish that I could've been gentler…

44:58.115 --> 44:59.992
kinder these last few months.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.535
You did your best.

45:02.744 --> 45:06.707
And when it mattered,
you were there to follow through.

45:18.177 --> 45:22.306
Swagger is the best in the DMV.

45:24.975 --> 45:26.268
There's no debating that.

45:30.981 --> 45:32.482
You hear any more about Jace?

45:33.192 --> 45:34.234
He's…

45:35.402 --> 45:37.404
waiting on the results of his MRI.

45:38.906 --> 45:42.117
The tension between you two,
what's going on?

45:42.701 --> 45:45.787
Meg.
Now is not the time to talk about this.

45:46.371 --> 45:48.749
Talking about the game
is how I honor my old man.

45:51.460 --> 45:52.461
Right.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.716
Jace and I got into it a while ago.

46:00.260 --> 46:01.887
Never came back from it, I guess.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.473
Got into it about what?

46:06.058 --> 46:10.479
About me not being someone
he thinks he can trust anymore.

46:11.772 --> 46:13.190
Yeah.

46:17.736 --> 46:21.114
You ever see the stats
of my last high school game?

46:22.074 --> 46:23.075
Your last game?

46:23.158 --> 46:24.159
Yeah.

46:24.785 --> 46:26.453
I'm a fan. I'm not a groupie.

46:26.537 --> 46:27.538
Oh, no.

46:28.705 --> 46:33.043
But yeah, I mean, everyone knows that
Icon averaged what, 30 a game?

46:35.045 --> 46:36.046
Yeah, well,

46:37.548 --> 46:43.095
my last game,
I went ten for 26 in the state final.

46:45.097 --> 46:46.098
And you lost.

46:46.181 --> 46:48.016
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

46:51.186 --> 46:54.106
You had an off game.
It happens to everyone.

46:54.773 --> 46:55.816
Not to me.

46:57.025 --> 46:58.068
Not like that.

46:58.777 --> 46:59.820
What are you saying?

47:03.156 --> 47:06.076
It wasn't just an off game.

47:11.790 --> 47:13.333
And my father…

47:15.335 --> 47:16.461
he knew it.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.047
He knew.

47:21.884 --> 47:24.678
We stopped speaking after that day.

47:30.350 --> 47:33.979
It wasn't him who couldn't
follow through on commitments.

47:35.856 --> 47:36.982
It was me.

47:40.444 --> 47:41.945
Then he died.

47:49.119 --> 47:50.954
There was a lot left unsaid.

48:04.134 --> 48:06.762
And Meg is one of the owners of the team.

48:07.387 --> 48:08.722
And we all feel bad for her.

48:08.805 --> 48:09.806
I'm sorry, Musa.

48:10.849 --> 48:13.560
But it's really great
how much you guys care for each other.

48:13.644 --> 48:15.562
Maybe that's why you all won.

48:16.355 --> 48:19.775
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
we're pretty much like a family.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.153
I wanted to talk to you, Tamika.

48:24.154 --> 48:26.698
I think I know what you're gonna say.

48:27.616 --> 48:28.659
You do?

48:30.035 --> 48:31.161
Yeah.

48:31.245 --> 48:34.122
And I like you too, Musa.

48:35.332 --> 48:36.458
A lot.

48:38.710 --> 48:41.255
I've never felt like
this for anyone before,

48:41.338 --> 48:45.717
and you're really kind and funny
and handsome.

48:45.801 --> 48:48.303
And when I'm with you, I'm happy.

48:50.305 --> 48:53.350
Uh-oh. Did I weird you out or something?

48:53.433 --> 48:54.643
No. No.

48:56.603 --> 48:59.147
I feel the exact same way.

49:00.274 --> 49:03.068
I mean, I like you a lot.

49:04.152 --> 49:05.779
I have since the day I met you,

49:06.822 --> 49:07.906
Queen Tamika.

49:20.460 --> 49:22.796
Your job is to stay positive.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.340
You just won the DMV Championship.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.968
And you're a high school player now.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.803
More is coming.

49:31.430 --> 49:33.891
And yes, hopefully you'll get to play
at Nationals.

49:33.974 --> 49:36.476
But if you don't,
it's not the end of the world.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.146
-For me it is.
-'Cause you're a competitor.

49:39.229 --> 49:40.856
But you ended the ABO season

49:40.939 --> 49:44.651
as the number one ranked player
in the DMV.

49:44.735 --> 49:46.778
There's nothing else to prove.

49:46.862 --> 49:48.572
My father won't know that.

49:48.655 --> 49:49.656
What?

49:52.618 --> 49:54.995
He lives in Florida, near Daytona.

49:56.205 --> 49:57.456
How do you know that?

49:59.875 --> 50:01.460
Because I tracked him down.

50:01.543 --> 50:04.004
And I wrote him,
and then he wrote me back.

50:05.339 --> 50:06.840
You went behind my back?

50:06.924 --> 50:10.010
-It's not like that exactly.
-Then how exactly is it?

50:11.094 --> 50:13.764
We just didn't tell you, Mom,
'cause it wasn't about you.

50:15.432 --> 50:18.644
He chose to not be in your life.
For a long time.

50:18.727 --> 50:20.187
Ten years.

50:20.270 --> 50:22.105
Ten years of not doing shit for us.

50:27.569 --> 50:31.281
So what is it you feel you need
from that man?

50:32.115 --> 50:33.116
I don't know.

50:34.243 --> 50:35.702
And I wanna find out.

50:35.786 --> 50:37.120
Me too, Mom.

50:38.288 --> 50:41.792
I wanna get to Nationals,
so he can see how tall I am.

50:43.377 --> 50:44.795
Or how good I've gotten.

50:46.255 --> 50:47.256
Why?

50:49.925 --> 50:51.969
It's just something I need.

51:01.812 --> 51:03.230
This is the doctor.

51:04.982 --> 51:06.191
Hi, Dr. Wallace.

51:06.942 --> 51:08.986
Yes. Can I put you on speaker?

51:09.945 --> 51:11.280
Okay, great.

51:12.531 --> 51:13.699
Okay, Doctor.

51:14.283 --> 51:16.118
Hi, Jace. How are you?

51:16.201 --> 51:17.202
You tell me.

51:17.286 --> 51:19.997
Well, we have the results from the MRI.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.833
It confirms there is an MCL sprain.

51:22.916 --> 51:25.419
We're looking at six weeks
as the earliest you can start

51:25.502 --> 51:27.129
to apply pressure on your leg.

51:28.130 --> 51:31.175
I'm sorry. I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

51:33.010 --> 51:34.052
Thank you, Doctor.

51:34.970 --> 51:36.180
We appreciate it.

52:18.597 --> 52:20.974
Settle down, Isaac. You got this.

52:44.748 --> 52:46.458
-Catch the damn ball.
-What?

52:46.542 --> 52:48.085
Five minutes left. No more turnovers.

52:48.168 --> 52:50.629
Are you crazy? What's done is done.
You're gonna get someone killed.

52:50.712 --> 52:51.713
You heard me.
