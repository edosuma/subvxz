WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:06.372
Woman:
<i> I spoke to Rebecca.</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:09.108
She wants to facetime
with you this week.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.211
I don't want her
seeing me like this.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.247
Your sister doesn't care
about your vanity, Alex.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.216
She's in kandahar, mom.

00:17.218 --> 00:21.220
Worrying about me is
a distraction she can't afford.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.155
Fine.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.357
But she's gonna have some
choice words for you,

00:25.359 --> 00:27.126
when she gets home
next month.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.460
(Laughs quietly)

00:28.462 --> 00:30.329
Just wait till she writes
my eulogy.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.463
(Laughs)

00:31.465 --> 00:33.232
You keep talking like that,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.367
and I am gonna be the
reason you're in this bed.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.407
I know the statistics
on leukemia, mom.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.343
You're gonna make it
through this.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.279
You know why?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.181
Because you're a Quinn.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.582
And a Quinn...

00:50.584 --> 00:54.053
Never backs down from a fight.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.188
That's my boy.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.123
Now get some rest.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.359
I'll check back
on you later.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.500
Recorded voice: We're sorry,
the number you are calling

01:08.502 --> 01:10.436
has been disconnected.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.504
Where are you, Sean?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.213
Paulette Quinn?

01:21.215 --> 01:23.148
No...

01:23.150 --> 01:24.483
Not Rebecca.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.285
The commandant of
the marine corps

01:26.287 --> 01:28.520
has entrusted me to express
his deep regret

01:28.522 --> 01:30.189
that your daughter,
captain Rebecca Quinn,

01:30.191 --> 01:31.490
was killed in action.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.559
(Sobbing)

01:38.399 --> 01:42.167
¶ ¶

02:08.863 --> 02:11.697
and here I am, rinsing her
off in the sink.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.865
Isn't she a beauty?

02:12.867 --> 02:15.267
That's one way
to describe it.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.336
She's kind of small.
How much does she weigh?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.338
20 pounds. 20 pounds.
She's perfect.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.340
Ah, look at you, proud papa.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.808
Let me see.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.810
Oh!

02:24.812 --> 02:26.178
Jimbo...

02:26.180 --> 02:28.780
What'd you do
to poor baby Victoria?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.315
Wha..? Tony,
it's a turducken.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.350
A what?!

02:31.352 --> 02:32.584
It's a turducken.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.886
It's a duck,
stuffed inside a chicken,

02:33.888 --> 02:35.271
stuffed inside a Turkey.

02:35.272 --> 02:36.655
That's like something
out of a horror movie!

02:36.657 --> 02:38.357
Jimmy: Well, this was
just a practice run.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.692
You know, the main event
is gonna happen

02:40.694 --> 02:42.427
on Thanksgiving,
at Dr. Mallard's.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.629
Oh!
Oh, don't forget

02:43.631 --> 02:45.197
Delilah and I will be late.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.431
We are joining Abby
at the soup kitchen

02:46.433 --> 02:47.533
earlier that afternoon.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.368
That's right!

02:49.370 --> 02:50.402
How about you, Tony?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.803
Oh, well...

02:51.805 --> 02:53.472
Zoe and senior

02:53.474 --> 02:54.573
are out of town,

02:54.575 --> 02:56.642
and, after the last few weeks,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.443
I need a little alone time.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.912
Jimmy:
I wish Ellie were here.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.813
This'd be right up her alley.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.649
Has anybody talked to her?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.617
She's still in Oklahoma
with her family.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.886
I know that holidays
are all about

03:07.888 --> 03:10.189
good will to men, but...

03:10.191 --> 03:12.624
I would love to give that Jake
a piece of my mind.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.493
Ooh. Agent Gibbs
already did that.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.528
I overheard him on
the phone yesterday.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.263
You know, there's this
vein that pulsates

03:18.265 --> 03:19.398
on Gibbs' forehead

03:19.400 --> 03:20.616
when he gets angry.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.833
And yesterday, I'm pretty sure
it was beating

03:21.835 --> 03:23.402
to the darth vader theme.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.469
(Jimmy laughing)

03:24.471 --> 03:26.605
You guys ever seen that?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.675
They are now.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.910
Ring, ring.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.378
(Clears throat)

03:33.380 --> 03:34.780
Aw, it's Dr. Mallard.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.615
I-i gotta take this.
This... (Stammers)

03:38.385 --> 03:39.451
(Chuckles quietly)

03:58.706 --> 04:00.572
Wow.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.841
Got enough kindling there
for five winters.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.543
Honey, why don't you
take a break?

04:04.545 --> 04:05.844
Come have some iced tea.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.479
Not really in the mood.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.014
You know, if I'd have
known you were

04:09.016 --> 04:11.850
going to be this productive,
i would've made a chore list.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.851
(Laughs)

04:12.853 --> 04:14.319
Is dad on the road yet?

04:14.321 --> 04:16.655
Yeah, they left Wyoming
about an hour ago.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.023
Your grandparents
are traveling with him,

04:18.025 --> 04:20.492
so they probably won't get here
till Thanksgiving.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.760
(Grunts)

04:21.762 --> 04:24.296
Are you ever gonna
call your brothers,

04:24.298 --> 04:25.564
and let them know
you're home, honey?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.366
They'd love to see you.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.967
They have their own lives, mom.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.569
(Grunts)

04:30.571 --> 04:33.505
Thanksgiving's just
a few days away and...

04:33.507 --> 04:34.973
I'll see them then.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.777
(Gently):
Eleanor... hey.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.549
Look, you know I'm here
for you, right?

04:44.551 --> 04:47.386
I just need some time, mom.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.354
Okay. I understand. I...

04:49.356 --> 04:51.556
Well, you might want
to remind Jake of that.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.392
Your phone's been
ringing nonstop.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.459
(Bishop sighs)

04:56.897 --> 04:59.431
(Sighs)

04:59.433 --> 05:03.502
You know, I do know a thing
or two about relationships.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.570
Whatever problems
you two are having,

05:05.572 --> 05:07.673
you know, you have
to address it.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.677
It's so much better to nip it
in the bud than let it drag on.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.612
(Phone ringing)

05:14.982 --> 05:16.948
(Sighs)

05:16.950 --> 05:19.017
You're right.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.428
Problem nipped.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.496
Think I'm ready
for that iced tea.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.835
I understand.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.937
Yes, it will have
our full attention.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.939
Of course.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.042
Yes, sir.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.578
That the was
the secretary of defense.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.014
He needs our help
with a time-sensitive matter.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.383
Terror threat?
No, Gibbs.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.951
A dying sailor.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.024
Lieutenant Alex Quinn, 26,

05:59.026 --> 06:00.425
a patient at Walter Reed.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.094
He's battling leukemia.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.730
Why is secdef involved
in a medical case?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.998
This became top priority

06:07.000 --> 06:10.869
for the dod after the death
of the lieutenant's sister.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.805
Marine captain
Rebecca Quinn.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.642
She was killed last week
by an I.E.D. In kandahar.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.578
Their oldest sibling,

06:19.580 --> 06:22.481
major William Quinn--

06:22.483 --> 06:24.266
he died nine months ago

06:24.267 --> 06:26.050
when his helo was shot down
in helmand province.

06:26.053 --> 06:30.021
This family has had
enough tragedy.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.924
What's is Alex
Quinn's prognosis?

06:32.926 --> 06:36.428
His best chance for survival
is a bone marrow transplant,

06:36.430 --> 06:38.830
but they haven't been able
to find a viable donor.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.399
The doctors are hoping

06:40.401 --> 06:42.567
there might be a match
within his familial DNA.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.770
Another sibling?
Yeah.

06:44.772 --> 06:48.140
Sean Quinn, 23,
youngest in the family.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.775
Where is he?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.510
That is the big question.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.578
Sean had a falling out
with his family six months ago,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.013
and no one's been able
to establish

06:55.015 --> 06:56.948
contact with him since.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.483
Clock's ticking, Gibbs.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.051
Find Sean Quinn.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.119
His brother's life
depends on it.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.532
The military's been in our blood
for generations.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.667
My husband and I both served,

07:15.669 --> 07:18.537
and our children wanted
to continue the tradition.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.105
Except Sean?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.174
Well, Sean tried to enlist,

07:22.176 --> 07:24.876
but was medically denied
due to a heart murmur.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.446
That rejection
always stuck with him.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.214
Is that when he
started having problems?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.016
No, he

07:31.018 --> 07:32.784
spiraled when will died.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.586
He was my oldest.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.021
Sean adored him.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.457
That's when
he started drinking.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.192
Got fired from his job, and

07:40.194 --> 07:43.462
fell in with a bad crowd.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.464
Bad how?

07:45.466 --> 07:47.132
Sean became secretive.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.167
He moved into a new apartment,

07:49.169 --> 07:52.237
and disappeared
for weeks at a time.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.107
When's the last time
you saw him?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.109
Six months ago.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.212
He stopped returning my calls
and just...

08:00.214 --> 08:03.215
Cut us out of his life.

08:03.217 --> 08:06.218
He doesn't even know
about Rebecca.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.521
Please, find Sean.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.990
Bring him home.

08:14.261 --> 08:18.163
And how long has Sean Quinn been
renting from you, Mr. brinkman?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.198
Oh, last eight months.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.167
Sean's not in any kind
of trouble, is he?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.769
No, we just want
to have a little chat with him.
Oh, that's good, 'cause

08:24.771 --> 08:26.204
he's the best tenant I have.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.073
You know, never throws parties,
is hardly around,

08:28.075 --> 08:29.574
and always pays on time.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.809
Wish all were like that.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.878
Any idea where Sean is now?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.247
Well, I don't get too involved
in my tenants' lives.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.249
It's harder to raise their rent
if I care about 'em.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.717
Look at you.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.619
The holiday spirit is alive
and well.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.687
I'm a business man,
and not a philanthropist.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.156
Tony?

08:45.158 --> 08:46.558
Oy, you better

08:46.560 --> 08:48.093
put that back
the way you found it.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.594
I'm not paying
for any damages.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.231
Looks like you got something.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.768
Whoa.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.936
Someone is in
for a serious rent increase.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.740
Guess being unemployed
pays these days.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.875
There's something else here.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.745
Passports.
Whose?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.216
Well, they have different names,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.785
but all the same
photo-- Sean Quinn.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.655
Well, whatever he's involved in,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.124
it doesn't look legal.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.097
(With Southern accent):
Lookie, lookie.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.300
It's federal agent Barbie.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.902
I see you're still
raiding dad's closet.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.271
No need to put on airs
around here.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.973
Quit talking like that, George.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.609
(Without Southern accent):
Oh, I missed you, sis.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.010
Oh!
Mmm! I missed you, too.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.645
Jb and the kids with you?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.247
They'll be here Thursday.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.849
I wanted some bonding time
with my baby sister.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.918
Mom called you.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
Mom called me.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.755
I told her
not to do that.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.124
Well, can you blame her?
You show up here, unannounced.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.161
Ah, I didn't know I needed
an invitation to come home.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.597
You're not exactly known
for your spontaneity, ell.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.099
Remember that Halloween
we tped the Van tassel house?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.202
You planned our attack
a year in advance.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.338
I like to be organized.
And I love that about you,

10:06.340 --> 10:08.607
but I know that your visit
has nothing to do

10:08.609 --> 10:11.209
with the holidays.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.044
(George grunts,
both laughing)

10:13.046 --> 10:14.312
I'm your big brother, ell.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.615
I'm gonna pry it out of you.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.951
Still hope you remember the
password to the clubhouse.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.954
Yeah.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.623
Abby:
Hey, Gibbs.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.325
Almost finished
with your pumpkin proxy.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.694
My what?

10:29.696 --> 10:32.631
Spot on, right?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.232
I made one of all of us.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.468
It's for my

10:36.469 --> 10:38.703
cornucopia centerpiece
for the soup kitchen.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.338
See, there's Tony,

10:40.340 --> 10:43.808
and... bishop.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.277
And... speaking of bishop,

10:46.279 --> 10:48.847
let's hear about
that phone call with Jake.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.982
Abbs.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.918
We<i> will</i> revisit this
at another time.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.687
What did you find?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.288
The money that Tony
and McGee found

10:57.290 --> 10:59.724
in Sean Quinn's
apartment is fake.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.727
Not the most significant
counterfeit I've ever seen.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.363
The coloring is distorted

11:05.365 --> 11:07.065
and there's no
3D ribboning,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.734
but, you know, it's good
enough to fool someone

11:09.736 --> 11:11.770
with an untrained eye.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.171
How much?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.007
$100,000 in this batch.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.409
There's no telling how much

11:17.411 --> 11:20.078
is already out in circulation.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.047
What was Sean Quinn doing

11:22.049 --> 11:25.283
with counterfeit currency?

11:25.285 --> 11:28.119
Tony: The holidays mean an
influx in cash transactions.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.721
Making it nearly
impossible to trace

11:29.723 --> 11:32.190
where the forgeries
originated,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.459
but Sean wasn't just
exploiting the retail angle.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.428
Over the last six months,
he made multiple trips

11:36.430 --> 11:38.363
to casinos
along the east coast,

11:38.365 --> 11:39.964
trading in the fakes
for the real ones.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.399
What about the passports?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.368
Aliases that Sean
traveled under.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.103
Loop in the secret service.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.907
Oh, they already know.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.175
Special agent fornell,
look at that.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.843
Your hair grew back almost.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.913
You see, this is why you're
my least favorite, DiNozzo.

11:54.915 --> 11:55.914
Scratch that.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.382
Second least favorite.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.750
Gibbs?

11:58.752 --> 11:59.968
New look.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.185
What's next--
skinny jeans?

12:01.188 --> 12:04.355
Care to fill us in, director?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.758
FBI and the secret service
have been tracking

12:06.760 --> 12:09.094
this counterfeiting
scheme for the last year.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.097
As far as we can ascertain,
it's a small group that keeps

12:12.099 --> 12:13.465
their inner circle protected.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.934
We're still trying to pin down
the base of operations.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.268
So, you got nothing.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.937
Ooh, somebody got up
on the wrong side

12:18.939 --> 12:20.222
of the couch this morning.

12:20.223 --> 12:21.506
Was Sean Quinn part
of this inner circle?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.907
No, no.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.509
Sean's just a lower-level
money washer.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.345
He was recruited by
a Thomas Reynolds.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.782
Friend from high school
and fellow washer.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.501
When Reynolds
got sticky fingers,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.219
he found himself in the potomac
with a bullet in his head.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.955
That's when Sean came
to us as an informant.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.090
Once he works his way
to the inner circle,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.492
we can take these guys down.

12:40.494 --> 12:41.960
Agent fornell has been briefed

12:41.962 --> 12:43.862
on the quinns'
family situation, Gibbs.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.396
We've worked out a compromise.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.399
I can't risk bringing Sean here
to give you a blood sample.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.934
So I'll take you to him.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.937
He's meeting us a designated
FBI safe house tonight.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.807
You didn't want
to lead with that?

12:55.809 --> 12:58.209
Did you ever get
that fruit basket I sent you?

13:00.013 --> 13:02.347
Absolutely no rush

13:02.349 --> 13:05.150
on a thank you card.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.351
I'm gonna kick his ass.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.786
(Laughs)

13:07.788 --> 13:09.954
Why is that funny?
I'm serious.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.556
Do you remember
the last time you tried

13:11.558 --> 13:12.991
to fight one of my boyfriends?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.359
You ended up
in the hospital

13:14.361 --> 13:16.127
with a broken nose.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.929
Mm-hmm, where I met
a cute candy striper

13:17.931 --> 13:19.497
who I fell in love with
and married.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.100
One of the best days
of my life.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.269
I don't think there's
much hope for a happy ending

13:24.271 --> 13:26.805
in this circumstance.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.513
Bringing out the big guns.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.951
1989 BlackBerry cordial.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.986
Wow, I can't believe
that's still in there.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.257
It's just what
the doctor ordered.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.246
Mmm.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.331
Are we gonna talk about
the gold elephant in the room?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.235
You're still
wearing your ring.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.506
Does that mean you want
to try and work it out?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.276
Marriage isn't something
you just give up on.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.078
Those vows meant
something to me.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.515
Hey, you weren't the
one who broke them.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.250
Even when things were
bad, I always thought

14:12.252 --> 14:16.221
that Jake and I would
find our way through it.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.057
When jb and I are
faced with challenges,

14:19.059 --> 14:21.526
that's when we lean
on each other the most.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.063
We're stronger
because of it.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.266
And that kind of love,

14:28.268 --> 14:31.336
can't exist without trust, ell.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.304
Barbara:
Eleanor?

14:33.306 --> 14:36.207
We're trying to
have a moment.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.409
Uh, there's a call for you
on the house line.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.579
It's a very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.082
Oh, duty calls.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.150
(Grunts)

14:50.891 --> 14:53.024
We passed this street twice.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.393
Had to make sure
we weren't being followed.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.028
(Car doors close)

14:57.030 --> 14:59.097
How's Emily?
Is she home?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.165
Yeah, she just got back from
boarding school yesterday.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.168
She told me she wants
to cook Thanksgiving dinner.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.169
That's nice.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.404
"Nice"?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.040
You remember what kind
of a cook Diane was?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.910
Yes, hard to forget.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.078
Emily's worse.
(Chuckles)

15:16.650 --> 15:18.416
Tobias?

15:20.186 --> 15:22.120
Hey, duck?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.621
Go wait in the car.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.057
Oh, splendid idea.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.272
That's agent Potter,
Sean's handler.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.712
His sidearm's gone.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.281
So's Sean.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.349
Where the hell is he?

16:02.595 --> 16:03.494
Got it, boss.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.463
We'll keep looking.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.966
Any sign of Sean Quinn
at the other safe houses.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.300
Nothing.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.172
The more time ticks away,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.474
the more Alex Quinn's
health deteriorates.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.177
We can't put all our eggs
in Sean's basket.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.979
Tony, what type of bullet
did Abby say

16:20.981 --> 16:22.513
killed special agent Potter?

16:22.515 --> 16:25.016
Nine millimeter, why?

16:25.018 --> 16:28.052
I just got a hit off of one
of Sean Quinn's passports.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.287
Nine millimeter glock

16:29.289 --> 16:31.990
is registered to
one of his aliases.

16:31.992 --> 16:35.460
Sean might be the shooter.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.530
What are you working
on that's so important?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.599
Is that a bone
marrow database?

16:41.601 --> 16:45.003
Yeah, we're trying to help
a dying sailor find a donor.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.573
The transplant team said there
wasn't a viable donor available.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.443
Turns out, there was
a match in the system, but...

16:52.445 --> 16:55.113
The donor declined
the transplant request.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.415
So your plan is to track them
down and change their mind?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.217
Exactly.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.486
I'm trying to hack
into the tissue database,

17:01.488 --> 17:04.022
and access
their contact information.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.592
I'm in.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.128
All right, the donor's name
is Richard doogan.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.363
He's former military
and he's only a few hours away

17:12.365 --> 17:14.399
in Kansas at--

17:14.401 --> 17:16.167
what?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.703
Uh, it's nothing.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.772
Ell, where in Kansas is he?

17:20.774 --> 17:23.441
Leavenworth
disciplinary barracks.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.245
Doogan's serving life
for double homicide.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.813
I need to update Gibbs.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.314
There's still time.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.483
I can head to leavenworth
and talk to doogan.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.586
Yeah, I'm sure the convicted
murderer is a reasonable man.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.823
Tell mom I'll be back later.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.391
Careful, Mr. Palmer.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.195
The skin will tear
if the stitches are too tight.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.664
No need to be a
backseat doctor, doctor.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.567
I have done this
many times before.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.702
Aren't we brimming
with confidence.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.073
And my work here

17:55.075 --> 17:56.674
is done.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.809
Bravo.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.745
Ah, Jethro, you're just in time

18:00.747 --> 18:02.080
for Mr. Palmer's unveiling.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.115
What's going on?

18:04.117 --> 18:07.518
As you can see,
I've been running a-fowl.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.854
(Chuckling)

18:09.856 --> 18:11.155
Oh, it's classic.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.290
You have something for me?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.825
We do.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.526
Hey, Gibbs.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.428
You ready for this?

18:17.430 --> 18:21.232
Sean Quinn did not kill
special agent Potter.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.600
The bullet

18:22.602 --> 18:24.368
we took from his chest cavity

18:24.370 --> 18:26.270
had on it DNA

18:26.272 --> 18:28.706
from two separate individuals.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.608
Special agent Potter's DNA

18:30.610 --> 18:33.544
and Sean Quinn's DNA.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.147
They were hit
with the same bullet, Gibbs.

18:36.149 --> 18:39.150
While it may not have
killed Sean Quinn,

18:39.152 --> 18:40.718
he would've required
medical attention.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.620
I checked with
all local hospitals,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.388
clinics, urgent cares--

18:44.390 --> 18:45.723
none of them
have a GSW victim

18:45.725 --> 18:47.391
that matches Sean Quinn's
physical description.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.793
He wouldn't go to a hospital.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.128
He knows somebody's after him.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.629
He'd be hiding out.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.432
Yeah, but where?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.810
Which pen pal program
are you from?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.546
The federal one.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.716
NCIS, special agent bishop.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.386
What could the Navy
possibly want from me?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.355
Your help.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.391
(Chuckles)
This I got to hear.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.661
In 2003, you were a patient
at St. Matthias hospital,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.730
where you gave a
tissue donation.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.399
You're the one who requested
my bone marrow.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.800
Technically no.

19:29.802 --> 19:33.638
But I'm asking that
you reconsider donating.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.707
Must be pretty important for you
to come all the way out here.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.177
Who's it for?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.812
Lieutenant Alex Quinn.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.548
He's battling leukemia,

19:43.550 --> 19:46.751
and you are
a near-perfect match for him.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.421
There's no other donor
in the system?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.190
At the moment, no.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.593
A donation would require
a minor surgical procedure.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.563
You would be transferred to the
medical ward for your recovery.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.464
There are some
risks, but--

20:00.466 --> 20:03.434
sure, I'll be the donor.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.369
Really?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.839
Thank you, doogan.

20:08.841 --> 20:12.376
You're saving a man's life.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.746
Uh, I do have
one stipulation.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.615
Which is what?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.483
A deal.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.520
In exchange
for my bone marrow,

20:22.522 --> 20:25.823
I want my life sentence
reduced to time served.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.461
I want to walk out of here
a free man.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.530
Open up.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.239
I knew Sean was
mixed up in something.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.241
But I never imagined this.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.409
He went to the FBI.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.311
He was trying to
do the right thing.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.380
And it got him shot.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.885
Do you have children,
agent Gibbs?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.922
I did.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.358
A daughter.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.927
Then you know
the unimaginable pain

21:02.929 --> 21:06.897
a parent goes through
having to bury their child.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.533
I lost a son

21:09.535 --> 21:11.669
and a daughter.

21:11.671 --> 21:16.374
Another is deteriorating
in front of my eyes.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.042
And now you tell me my youngest

21:18.044 --> 21:21.012
is seriously injured
and missing.

21:22.749 --> 21:26.017
I don't think
i could take much more.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.585
Your sons?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.920
They are strong
just like you.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.722
And we'll save
both of them.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.024
How?

21:33.026 --> 21:34.492
By finding Sean.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.527
Where would he go and lay low?

21:36.529 --> 21:37.962
Someplace he feels safe.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.565
His boat.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.668
Sean and will bought it from
a junkyard a few years ago.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.902
The two of them spent

21:44.904 --> 21:46.671
nearly every weekend
trying to restore it.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.572
Where's that?

21:48.574 --> 21:51.375
A storage unit
near spinnaker Marina.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.648
Tony:
<i> Which unit is Sean's?</i>

21:57.650 --> 21:59.050
Number 12.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.836
Oh.

22:01.837 --> 22:04.621
Ten bucks, the name of the
boat is a nautical pun.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.658
25-foot cruiser named
<i>latitude adjustment.</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:10.428
Yeah. Name of the
boat is crucial.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.463
I've had mine picked
out for years.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.465
Go ahead, you'll
never guess.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.100
<i>The codfather?</i>

22:16.102 --> 22:17.468
We've been working
together too long.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.536
Here we go.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.972
McGee:
Blood.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.985
(Whispers):
Look at the blood.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.527
It's Sean.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.065
He's alive.
Call an ambulance.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.950
Tony:
Gibbs.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.787
What's the update
on Sean's condition?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.556
He lost a lot of blood.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.759
Bullet didn't do
any serious damage.

23:14.761 --> 23:18.796
Doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.501
What, DiNozzo?

23:23.503 --> 23:27.138
The hospital did
a full blood panel on Sean.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.740
He's not a viable donor
for his brother.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.442
Leavenworth's
the only option left.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.644
What did bishop find
on the inmate?

23:33.646 --> 23:35.513
Oh, well...

23:35.515 --> 23:38.516
This guy, Richard doogan,

23:38.518 --> 23:41.018
former army sergeant,
33 years old.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.421
Eight years into a life sentence

23:43.423 --> 23:46.190
for the murder of
two Iraqi detainees in 2007.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.892
Any family?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.527
Parents are deceased.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.529
No spouse, no sibling,
no children.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.531
We have no leverage
against this guy.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.534
The fact that doogan's so
close a match to Alex Quinn

23:56.536 --> 23:57.735
is already an anomaly.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.837
That's why he's angling
for a deal.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.006
Doogan knows
he holds all the cards.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.674
You're running
point, DiNozzo.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.776
Find out who shot Sean,

24:05.778 --> 24:09.146
who killed agent Potter.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.781
And where are you going?

24:11.751 --> 24:13.818
I got a plane to catch.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.722
Hey. What's going on?

24:18.724 --> 24:21.692
Abby: I'm watching casino
security footage on Sean Quinn.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.696
I'm trying to find a way
into this counterfeit scheme.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.165
So far,
it's just been a bust.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.835
I mean,
either Sean was there alone

24:30.837 --> 24:34.071
or the cameras never caught him
meeting up with anybody.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.907
Fornell mentioned that
the FBI and secret service

24:36.909 --> 24:38.943
have been after these forgers
for a year.

24:38.945 --> 24:42.780
Sean only came into the
operation six months ago.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.115
So that means someone else had
to be doing the casino runs

24:45.117 --> 24:46.617
before he came along.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.186
Okay. Let's check footage from

24:49.188 --> 24:52.523
earlier this year using
facial recognition software,

24:52.525 --> 24:55.059
see if we can find
any frequent visitors.

24:58.564 --> 24:59.563
Oh!

24:59.565 --> 25:01.131
We have a winner.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.801
I know him.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.837
That's the building manager
at Sean Quinn's apartment.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.006
Alton brinkman.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.708
I know our way in.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.077
And someone's luck
is about to run out.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.647
Barbara (Quietly):
So is she gonna stay with him?

25:16.649 --> 25:17.815
George:
I don't know.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.016
Well, she's got to
make a decision.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.150
(Clears throat)

25:20.152 --> 25:21.919
Hey, sis.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.921
Hi, honey.
You want some iced tea?

25:23.923 --> 25:26.524
Stop with the iced tea.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.192
I don't have time; I got to
get back to leavenworth.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.793
I thought that
was a dead end.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.595
I need to try again.

25:31.597 --> 25:32.863
Right now?

25:32.865 --> 25:35.065
There's a sailor's life
on the line.

25:35.067 --> 25:38.702
And that's your
responsibility?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.237
Yes, mom.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.705
This is what I do.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.940
This is my job.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.043
Are you sure
it's not your excuse, honey?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.679
What's that supposed to mean?

25:48.681 --> 25:49.914
George:
Um, we got company.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.115
Barbara:
Who is it?

25:52.652 --> 25:54.285
George:
Some guy in a suit.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.286
Silver hair.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.855
Great.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.265
Are you really in Oklahoma?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.800
Howdy.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.136
What are you doing here, Gibbs?

26:12.138 --> 26:14.305
We're heading to leavenworth.

26:14.307 --> 26:15.973
Deal came through
for doogan.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.241
How'd you pull that off?

26:17.243 --> 26:19.710
Eleanor bishop,
it's not polite

26:19.712 --> 26:21.845
to leave your company
hovering around outside.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.148
It's also harder for us to
eavesdrop when you're out here.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.683
(Barbara chuckles)

26:25.685 --> 26:28.953
Mom, George,
this is my boss,

26:28.955 --> 26:31.622
special agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

26:31.624 --> 26:32.990
Oh. Barbara.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.925
It's a pleasure to
meet you. Finally.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.827
Likewise.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.228
You look like a coffee
man, agent Gibbs.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.363
Why don't you
come on inside...

26:39.365 --> 26:40.898
Uh, it'll have
to wait, mom.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.800
We've got
somewhere to be.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.769
Okay.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.837
Bye, honey.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.876
What the hell is this?

26:52.878 --> 26:54.878
The terms for your deal.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.113
What deal?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.616
It says that
my life sentence stands.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.117
With a possibility of parole.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.785
You didn't have that before.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.354
Parole in 40 years?

27:03.356 --> 27:05.389
I wouldn't get out
till I was over 70!

27:05.391 --> 27:07.224
Better than never.

27:08.894 --> 27:12.296
Maybe I wasn't clear earlier.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.365
The only way
you're getting my bone marrow

27:14.367 --> 27:16.100
is if I get out of prison now.

27:16.102 --> 27:19.103
You unloaded your m4
into two unarmed men.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.804
Detainees!

27:20.806 --> 27:23.073
Terrorists responsible for
countless deaths.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.975
They got justice.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.978
You acted as
judge, jury and executioner.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.813
That's not justice.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.050
You ever killed someone in
the line of work, agent bishop?

27:33.052 --> 27:36.053
What about you,
agent Gibbs?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.890
Yeah, how many?

27:39.892 --> 27:42.292
Bad people, right?

27:42.294 --> 27:44.995
But you did
what you had to.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.997
So did I.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.334
I sleep better at night
knowing that they're gone.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.902
You shouldn't.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.370
Because no matter
how many you stop,

27:53.372 --> 27:56.173
there's always gonna be
someone to take their place.

27:58.678 --> 28:02.813
This deal is the only one
you're ever gonna get, doogan.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.051
You take it or leave it.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.821
I'll leave it.

28:12.958 --> 28:16.694
You want me to help
save that sailor's life?

28:16.696 --> 28:18.228
Save mine first.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.046
(Sighs)

28:36.048 --> 28:39.783
I got nothing to say
till my lawyer gets here.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.869
That's fine with us.

28:41.870 --> 28:43.954
All the evidence we got on you,
we don't need a confession.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.723
(Sighs)

28:45.725 --> 28:48.992
If that were true,
you'd charge me.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.260
You're bluffing.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.964
Maybe we should
show him our hand.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.999
Then he'll know
how deep a hole he's in.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.135
Mm-hmm.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.107
The glock we found
in your apartment.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.275
Which I have a permit for.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.410
Nice try.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.146
Ballistics, genius.

29:10.282 --> 29:14.384
The bullet that killed an
FBI agent came from this gun.

29:14.386 --> 29:18.255
Sean Quinn regained
consciousness

29:18.257 --> 29:21.024
and identified you
as the shooter.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.030
Oh. There's the tell.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.298
House wins.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.368
Alton brinkman,
you are under arrest

29:31.370 --> 29:34.004
for the murder of
special agent Charles Potter.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.173
Okay, all right, wait!

29:36.175 --> 29:38.408
Oh, you know
when to fold 'em, brinkman?

29:38.410 --> 29:41.078
I can help you
take down my boss, all right?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.013
You can bust his whole
counterfeit operation,

29:43.015 --> 29:44.414
but you need to
give me protection.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.016
He's got friends everywhere.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.818
Then you better keep talking.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.487
His name's Malcolm turro.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.022
I was his monitor.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.991
My job was to stay
below the radar

29:53.993 --> 29:55.826
and keep an eye
on the lower-level runners.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.327
Like Sean Quinn.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.929
Yeah.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.530
I got suspicious when you guys
showed up looking for him,

30:00.533 --> 30:03.284
so I tailed him.

30:03.285 --> 30:06.036
When I saw him with a fed,
i tried to take them both out.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.805
I had no choice.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.307
If turro had found out
that Sean was a snitch,

30:10.309 --> 30:12.876
he'd have killed me
for letting it happen.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.479
Turro's operation--
where's it located?

30:16.448 --> 30:19.349
Out of a warehouse in Arlington.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.354
I hope you'll join us
for Thanksgiving, Gibbs.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.590
My husband would
love to meet you.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.293
I'm sure he has
to get back, mom.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.128
Ellie's a lot
like her father.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.130
They're very direct.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.366
They're both intellectuals,
and they're reserved.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.467
And don't forget stubborn.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.069
You know, a perfect example

30:39.071 --> 30:41.071
was her fourth birthday.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.607
She decided it was time to
take those training wheels

30:43.609 --> 30:45.409
off her bike.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.577
So the training
wheels came off.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.412
Yeah, ell barely made it
down the driveway

30:48.414 --> 30:50.414
before she toppled over.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.282
Thought for sure
she was gonna cry.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.617
But she didn't.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.320
Oh, no. She got
right back on the bike.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.055
That's my daughter.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.456
(Phone ringing)

30:59.458 --> 31:02.192
I'll get it.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.463
Would you like some more
chicken? You okay?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.998
Don't mind if I do.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.467
Hello?

31:10.469 --> 31:12.102
I told you not to call here.

31:13.639 --> 31:16.173
No, I'm not coming
back for Thanksgiving.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.442
It's not my concern, Jake.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.378
Spend it wherever
and with whomever you want.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.581
(Sighs)

31:34.927 --> 31:37.160
That's it.
I-i can't take this anymore.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.595
George...
No, mom.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.064
Jake has the nerve to call
this house after what he did,

31:41.066 --> 31:43.233
and that's the only thing
you have to say to him?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.370
Not me. I'm calling that weasel
back and telling him off.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.404
Who does he think he is?!

31:47.406 --> 31:49.339
George Russell
bishop, sit down.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.041
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.409
I'm the only one
acting normally here.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.944
She's my little sister,

31:53.946 --> 31:55.479
and if he thinks he can
disrespect her like that...

31:55.481 --> 31:56.914
Okay! Enough!

31:56.916 --> 31:59.249
Just, stop it! Both of you.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.388
I don't need you
fighting my battles.

32:04.390 --> 32:08.025
This is my life, my marriage,
and it's my decision.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.260
So back off!

32:12.398 --> 32:14.531
What is wrong with you?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.267
(Sighs) Okay, my
timing wasn't great.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.702
You think?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.237
Go cool off.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.538
I'm gonna go talk to her.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.607
Excuse me.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.515
(Cell phone ringing)

32:32.985 --> 32:33.984
Yeah.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.319
Gibbs.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.720
Boss, hey. I'm at the hospital.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.956
Alex Quinn's taken
a turn for the worse.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.023
We're running out of time.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.674
Going somewhere?

32:57.676 --> 32:59.710
Gibbs, uh...

32:59.712 --> 33:02.312
I was just going
for a run.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.281
I need to clear my head.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.616
I think you done enough
running, bishop.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.618
(Sighs)

33:08.620 --> 33:13.323
A lecture is the last thing
i need right now.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.526
Hmm. What do you need?

33:16.528 --> 33:19.029
For everyone to stop treating me

33:19.031 --> 33:22.733
like I'm this fragile thing
that's about to break.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.601
(Laughs)

33:24.603 --> 33:26.636
What?

33:26.638 --> 33:29.506
How many times a week
did you check on me after Iraq?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.641
You kept showing up,

33:31.643 --> 33:33.710
even after I said I was fine.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.479
That's different, Gibbs.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.581
You almost died.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.682
We were all worried.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.617
So is your family.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.552
They just want
to make it better.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.122
I've been so inundated

33:45.124 --> 33:47.758
with everyone's opinions on...

33:47.760 --> 33:50.193
How I should feel,
and what I should do

33:50.195 --> 33:53.330
that I haven't been able
to actually process it myself.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.299
You can't do that
if you won't talk about it.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.607
Wow.

34:05.544 --> 34:09.212
<i> You</i> are telling me to talk
about my feelings?

34:10.582 --> 34:12.716
All right.

34:12.718 --> 34:16.553
Tell me, Gibbs, how-how have
you processed getting shot?

34:16.555 --> 34:20.290
Who is it that
you're opening up to?

34:20.292 --> 34:22.592
Dr. taft.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.798
I've been talking with him
since the Sudan case.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.336
Everyone reaches a point,
bishop, even me.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.577
You just got
to take the first step.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.781
What if I can't?

34:44.783 --> 34:47.150
Rule number 28--

34:47.152 --> 34:51.088
"when you need help, ask."

34:52.491 --> 34:55.392
(Sighs)

34:55.394 --> 34:57.761
Fornell:
<i> Okay.</i>

34:57.763 --> 34:59.463
We've set up the
surveillance Van

34:59.465 --> 35:00.697
at the warehouse
in Arlington.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.299
Any sign of Malcolm turro?

35:02.301 --> 35:03.633
Not yet.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.769
Brinkman better not
be playing us.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.672
Well, he wasn't lying
about turro being dangerous.

35:08.674 --> 35:11.174
McGee:
Interpol's been after
him since 2008.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.844
Turro's wanted in connection
with over 15 murders.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.679
Tony: His first foray
into counterfeiting was

35:15.681 --> 35:17.147
in Belarus.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.683
(Phone ringing)

35:19.685 --> 35:21.751
Fornell.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.154
Set up a perimeter.
We're on our way.

35:24.156 --> 35:27.557
Visual confirmation
on turro. Let's move.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.698
The threading is good.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.834
I want this batch to hit the
market during the holidays.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.240
Federal agents!

35:43.242 --> 35:45.142
Don't move!

35:45.144 --> 35:46.476
(Grunts)

35:52.284 --> 35:53.917
Put the weapon down, turro.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.854
There are two ways this can go.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.292
Choose wisely.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.298
(Grunts)

36:08.300 --> 36:10.634
Make that<i> three</i> ways.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.907
(Chains jingling)

36:19.711 --> 36:21.811
Bad cop sitting this one out?

36:24.716 --> 36:26.950
He's waiting outside.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.953
You have good news for me?

36:29.955 --> 36:32.889
There's not gonna be
another deal.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.759
It's not possible
with your conviction.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.295
Then why'd you come back here?

36:38.297 --> 36:40.797
Because we still
need your help.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.868
I think you're a good person

36:44.870 --> 36:47.470
who made mistakes.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.240
You don't know a thing about me.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.510
I know about the two
Iraqi detainees you killed.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.579
How they were responsible

36:55.581 --> 36:58.515
for targeting U.S. troops
with roadside bombs.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.752
One of their victims was...

37:02.754 --> 37:05.755
Corporal David Logan.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.824
He was your friend.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.994
Look...

37:10.996 --> 37:13.964
Grief can push anyone
to extremes.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.566
You wanted revenge.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.635
What I did saved
soldiers' lives.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.972
And it cost you yours.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.908
(Photo shuffling on table)

37:24.910 --> 37:26.943
I can't change the past.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.945
No,

37:28.947 --> 37:31.281
but...

37:31.283 --> 37:34.884
You can change the future.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.020
Yours<i> and</i> Alex Quinn's.

37:37.022 --> 37:40.890
A sailor who fought
bravely for his country,

37:40.892 --> 37:43.526
and he's fighting for his life.

37:46.365 --> 37:49.766
A life...

37:49.768 --> 37:52.602
That you can save.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.604
You once took an oath

37:54.606 --> 37:57.007
to never leave
a fallen soldier behind.

37:58.543 --> 38:01.911
Now's your chance
to make good on that promise.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.783
A deal was my only shot
at getting out of here.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.921
I just wanted a fresh start.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.291
That's exactly what this is--

38:14.293 --> 38:16.493
a new beginning.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.964
I know.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.970
Don't let a bad situation define
who you are.

38:37.349 --> 38:41.384
Alex should receive the
transplant in a few days.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.453
Should be on his
feet by the new year.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.922
Thanks to doogan.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.526
And you.

38:49.528 --> 38:53.096
I wasn't sure I'd be able
to get through to him.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.667
I never doubted
you for a moment.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.646
You're late.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.849
It's good to see you,
too, brother.

39:20.759 --> 39:24.027
Brinkman and turro
have been processed.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.930
And I have just enough time
to pick up wine for tonight.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.465
Big Thanksgiving plans?

39:28.467 --> 39:29.866
No. Just dinner

39:29.868 --> 39:32.369
with Emily if she hasn't already
burned the place down.

39:32.371 --> 39:33.837
(Laughs)

39:33.839 --> 39:35.538
Why are you still here?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.507
Oh, I offered
to do McGee's reports

39:37.509 --> 39:39.976
so he and Delilah could join
Abby at the soup kitchen.

39:39.978 --> 39:44.581
Look at you, all filled
with the holiday spirit.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.750
Just looking out for my team.

39:46.752 --> 39:49.986
Heard about your little
Sudan trip.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.856
About la grenouille's doctor
daughter.

39:52.858 --> 39:56.025
It's a small
world, isn't it?

39:56.027 --> 39:58.595
Feels smaller every day.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.930
(Sighs)

40:00.932 --> 40:03.867
Fornell?

40:03.869 --> 40:07.637
Here, this'll save you
a trip to the store.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.974
A châteauneuf-du-pape?

40:10.976 --> 40:12.542
Very nice.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.010
Happy Thanksgiving.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.953
All right, this
is too pathetic.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.588
Grab your stuff, let's go.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.056
Go where?

40:27.058 --> 40:28.992
My house.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.960
You're inviting me to your house
for Thanksgiving dinner?

40:30.962 --> 40:33.096
I thought I was your second
least favorite?

40:33.098 --> 40:37.000
You are, but dry Turkey,
blackened dinner rolls--

40:37.002 --> 40:39.602
it's really more
of a punishment.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.473
So now that we're friends,
can I call you Toby?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.942
Don't push your luck.
(Laughs)

40:50.649 --> 40:52.982
Ah.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.485
Bird's coming along nicely.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.156
You know, we have
a peeler for that.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.091
Mm-hmm.

41:04.129 --> 41:07.063
My daughter doesn't open up
to many people, Gibbs.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.199
So I guess if she trusts you,

41:09.201 --> 41:11.468
I should, too.

41:24.115 --> 41:27.817
It is not easy knowing
she's hundreds of miles away,

41:27.819 --> 41:30.053
working in a dangerous job.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.188
If I had my way,

41:32.190 --> 41:34.657
she'd live here
and be a teacher.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.659
Or a nun.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.796
Daughters.

41:41.766 --> 41:44.067
That being said, um,

41:44.069 --> 41:46.102
it is very comforting

41:46.104 --> 41:49.239
to know she's surrounded
by people who care about her.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.177
I'll look after her.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.615
I'm counting on that.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.183
Mom, where's the
serving platter?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.851
Oh, honey, I'll do that.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.520
You-you two finish up here.
Come on.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.088
Uh, you know, your brothers

42:05.090 --> 42:08.024
and your father are gonna
be here in a minute.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.726
Gibbs, keep that knife handy.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.195
This bunch that's coming in now?

42:12.197 --> 42:14.030
(Laughs)

42:17.135 --> 42:21.571
I'm, um... I'm ready
to go home, back to DC.

42:21.573 --> 42:24.140
I'll head out Saturday.

42:24.142 --> 42:27.710
You got room in your
truck for one more?

42:27.712 --> 42:31.147
Only booked a
one-way ticket.

42:31.149 --> 42:35.018
Wasn't leaving
here without you.

42:38.156 --> 42:42.125
Yeah, I could use a navigator.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.893
(Peeling)

42:54.172 --> 42:56.806
Happy Thanksgiving, Gibbs.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.808
Yeah.

42:58.810 --> 42:59.876
You, too, bishop.
