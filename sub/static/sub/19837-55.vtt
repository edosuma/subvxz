00:02.850 --> 00:04.770
<b>Did you sell him out?</b>

00:05.330 --> 00:06.860
<b>Sell out Uvo?!</b>

00:13.190 --> 00:14.900
<b>I'll take that as a yes...</b>

00:15.540 --> 00:16.370
<b>Outta my way!</b>

00:16.370 --> 00:17.750
<b>Hold on...</b>

00:17.750 --> 00:19.310
<b>Let's hear his explanation.</b>

00:19.310 --> 00:20.380
<b>Explanation?</b>

00:20.380 --> 00:21.530
<b>What is there to explain?</b>

00:21.530 --> 00:23.180
<b>Calm down.</b>

00:23.180 --> 00:27.630
<b>Didn't the boss tell us that prophecies can 
be avoided, depending on our actions?</b>

00:27.940 --> 00:31.280
<b>Hisoka, explain what happened this week.</b>

00:31.980 --> 00:33.190
<b>I cannot.</b>

00:33.190 --> 00:34.260
<b>What?!</b>

00:34.260 --> 00:39.140
<b>All I can say is that the first verse was true...</b>

00:39.940 --> 00:41.570
<b>Nothing more.</b>

00:42.270 --> 00:43.630
<b>You hear that?!</b>

00:43.630 --> 00:44.290
<b>Move!</b>

00:44.290 --> 00:45.720
<b>Just hold on.</b>

00:45.720 --> 00:47.770
<b>Hisoka, why can't you explain?</b>

00:48.030 --> 00:49.590
<b>If I were to tell you the reason,</b>

00:49.590 --> 00:52.340
<b>I would be telling you 
precisely what I cannot say.</b>

00:52.340 --> 00:53.780
<b>Thus, I cannot say.</b>

00:54.370 --> 00:55.790
<b>It isn't that I won't.</b>

00:55.790 --> 00:56.790
<b>I cannot.</b>

00:57.230 --> 00:59.780
<b>That's all I can let you know.</b>

01:01.300 --> 01:03.540
<b>If you cannot accept my answer,</b>

01:04.270 --> 01:06.540
<b>then in order to defend myself...</b>

01:07.700 --> 01:10.040
<b>I'll have no choice but to fight.</b>

02:31.000 --> 02:36.050
<b>Allies x And x Lies</b>

02:36.790 --> 02:38.610
<b>After seeing Hisoka's fortune,</b>

02:38.610 --> 02:41.520
<b>Nobunaga suspects Hisoka of betraying them,</b>

02:41.520 --> 02:43.010
<b>and draws his sword.</b>

02:50.270 --> 02:51.500
<b>Forget it.</b>

02:52.000 --> 02:53.940
<b>You're impossible to deal with.</b>

02:54.900 --> 02:57.720
<b>As if, you fool!</b>

03:01.270 --> 03:02.110
<b>What?</b>

03:03.340 --> 03:04.620
<b>Nobunaga,</b>

03:06.270 --> 03:07.620
<b>stop talking for a bit.</b>

03:07.940 --> 03:08.930
<b>Huh?</b>

03:10.210 --> 03:12.020
<b>Did the boss do that?</b>

03:12.020 --> 03:12.970
<b>Probably.</b>

03:15.070 --> 03:17.630
<b>Hisoka, I have a few questions for you.</b>

03:18.280 --> 03:20.630
<b>If you're unable to answer, just say so.</b>

03:20.630 --> 03:26.890
<b>A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, 
seeking to make a trade. 
The customer will use the sword of law upon you, 
taking the calendar's secrets with him.</b>

03:21.290 --> 03:25.080
<b>In the fortune, what are 
the calendar's secrets?</b>

03:25.080 --> 03:26.890
<b>The powers of the Troupe's members.</b>

03:27.600 --> 03:29.150
<b>Of how many members?</b>

03:29.150 --> 03:30.830
<b>Seven.</b>

03:30.830 --> 03:32.490
<b>No, eight.</b>

03:33.070 --> 03:34.880
<b>The boss and Uvogin,</b>

03:34.880 --> 03:37.540
<b>Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,</b>

03:37.540 --> 03:40.990
<b>Pakunoda, Shalnark, and I add up to eight.</b>

03:42.970 --> 03:45.880
<b>So until yesterday, you didn't 
know of Kortopi's ability?</b>

03:46.340 --> 03:47.910
<b>That is correct.</b>

03:48.300 --> 03:49.810
<b>What is our opponent's power?</b>

03:49.810 --> 03:50.780
<b>I cannot say.</b>

03:51.500 --> 03:53.180
<b>What about his appearance?</b>

03:53.180 --> 03:54.260
<b>I cannot say.</b>

03:54.900 --> 03:57.020
<b>What is your relationship to him?</b>

03:57.020 --> 03:58.370
<b>I cannot say.</b>

04:01.600 --> 04:02.800
<b>I understand.</b>

04:09.300 --> 04:11.970
<b>The red-eyed customer, the chain user,</b>

04:11.970 --> 04:14.860
<b>has two abilities at the very least.</b>

04:15.580 --> 04:18.460
<b>One would be the ability he 
used to capture Uvogin.</b>

04:18.460 --> 04:22.570
<b>The other would be the ability that 
prevents Hisoka from speaking.</b>

04:22.570 --> 04:29.870
<b>seeking to make a trade. 
The customer will use the sword of law upon you, 
taking the calendar's secrets with him.</b>

04:23.160 --> 04:28.020
<b>Since the fortune uses the 
phrase "sword of law,"</b>

04:28.020 --> 04:30.700
<b>the latter must be able to compel 
you to follow set rules.</b>

04:31.650 --> 04:34.250
<b>"Do not lie to me."</b>

04:34.250 --> 04:37.260
<b>"Do not give out any information about me."</b>

04:37.260 --> 04:38.840
<b>Something like that.</b>

04:39.180 --> 04:41.570
<b>I would also assume</b>

04:41.570 --> 04:45.720
<b>that he placed something inside Hisoka's body.</b>

04:47.720 --> 05:00.980
<b>A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, 
seeking to make a trade. 
The customer will use the sword of law upon you, 
taking the calendar's secrets with him.</b>

04:48.020 --> 04:51.640
<b>The first half of the verse mentions a trade,</b>

04:51.640 --> 04:55.650
<b>but the second half only describes 
what the customer took.</b>

04:55.650 --> 05:00.980
<b>This suggests that the sword 
of law would attack Hisoka.</b>

05:00.980 --> 05:05.540
<b>In other words, he traded the 
sword's attack for our secrets.</b>

05:06.400 --> 05:08.990
<b><i>Oh, so lovely...</i></b>

05:09.760 --> 05:14.620
<b>The sword that can restrict Hisoka's 
speech is powerful indeed.</b>

05:15.010 --> 05:18.380
<b><i>You are magnificent...</i></b>

05:18.710 --> 05:22.880
<b><i>I absolutely must be the one to kill you.</i></b>

05:23.220 --> 05:25.130
<b>Let's review.</b>

05:25.700 --> 05:27.580
<b>We're up against the chain user.</b>

05:27.580 --> 05:31.380
<b>He's either a Manipulator who used 
real chains to defeat Uvo,</b>

05:31.380 --> 05:35.140
<b>or a Conjurer who used <i>Nen</i> 
chains to defeat him.</b>

05:35.870 --> 05:38.130
<b>Is there a difference?</b>

05:38.130 --> 05:39.350
<b>A big difference.</b>

05:39.350 --> 05:42.600
<b>A Conjurer could walk around unarmed.</b>

05:42.600 --> 05:44.400
<b>That's a huge advantage.</b>

05:44.830 --> 05:45.790
<b>I see.</b>

05:45.790 --> 05:48.610
<b>Conjurers have to exercise their imaginations,</b>

05:48.610 --> 05:51.910
<b>but it's easy to conjure 
something you're familiar with.</b>

05:52.580 --> 05:55.910
<b>The problem is the power 
that's restricting Hisoka.</b>

05:56.310 --> 05:59.690
<b>Since it's the sword of law, it must 
involve rules he has to follow.</b>

05:59.690 --> 06:04.340
<b>Yes, it's very likely that two are the 
commands the boss mentioned.</b>

06:04.340 --> 06:07.050
<b>Also, he's probably barred from 
attacking the chain user.</b>

06:07.050 --> 06:10.760
<b>And I'd imagine that he'll die 
if he breaks those rules.</b>

06:12.680 --> 06:13.860
<b><i>How amusing.</i></b>

06:14.410 --> 06:18.140
<b><i>There is no sword of law in my body...</i></b>

06:18.890 --> 06:21.690
<b><i>That fortune was my own creation.</i></b>

06:22.450 --> 06:25.690
<b><i>I only revealed the powers of two members.</i></b>

06:26.080 --> 06:27.190
<b><i>Not eight.</i></b>

06:27.720 --> 06:31.060
<b><i>It was a risky gamble that would have turned</i></b>

06:31.060 --> 06:34.580
<b><i>the entire Troupe against me, 
if the boss hadn't figured that out.</i></b>

06:35.950 --> 06:39.210
<b><i>All to keep the spiders in Yorknew City,</i></b>

06:40.040 --> 06:42.220
<b><i>to allow me to fight the boss.</i></b>

06:43.630 --> 06:45.450
<b><i>Should we leave Yorknew City,</i></b>

06:45.450 --> 06:48.970
<b><i>it's hard to say when I'll see the boss again.</i></b>

06:52.160 --> 06:55.220
<b>What about Hisoka's second verse?</b>

06:55.910 --> 06:59.160
<b>"The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,</b>

06:59.160 --> 07:01.410
<b>losing five more legs.</b>

07:01.890 --> 07:03.860
<b>Do not leave your temporary shelter,</b>

07:03.860 --> 07:06.440
<b>for you are one of the remaining legs."</b>

07:07.670 --> 07:10.700
<b>If he leaves our temporary shelter, this base,</b>

07:10.700 --> 07:13.120
<b>then Hisoka will die.</b>

07:13.450 --> 07:15.300
<b>What does the homesick part mean?</b>

07:15.300 --> 07:17.250
<b>It refers to our desire to go home.</b>

07:17.250 --> 07:21.270
<b>If we return home, half of us will die.</b>

07:21.270 --> 07:22.370
<b>I get it.</b>

07:22.800 --> 07:27.430
<b>Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda, Shalnark.</b>

07:27.430 --> 07:29.540
<b>One more for half the members...</b>

07:30.310 --> 07:33.140
<b>No one else's fortune predicted their death?</b>

07:33.500 --> 07:36.410
<b>Then it has to be Feitan, Kortopi, or me.</b>

07:36.410 --> 07:39.640
<b>We didn't get our fortunes told 
because we lacked the data.</b>

07:40.350 --> 07:42.160
<b>I am staying here.</b>

07:42.760 --> 07:45.650
<b>There's something I wish to do before I die.</b>

07:46.690 --> 07:48.650
<b>I will not be leaving our temporary shelter.</b>

07:50.680 --> 07:52.530
<b>Boss, what should we do?</b>

07:53.010 --> 07:55.280
<b>Leave or stay?</b>

08:05.880 --> 08:06.880
<b>Stay.</b>

08:08.330 --> 08:09.300
<b>No.</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:11.070
<b>Huh? Why not?</b>

08:11.070 --> 08:14.430
<b>You were the one who wanted to 
capture the Phantom Troupe.</b>

08:14.760 --> 08:17.180
<b>It'd be pointless now.</b>

08:17.180 --> 08:19.330
<b>But why?</b>

08:19.330 --> 08:24.070
<b>With the reward gone, you'd be 
taking a big risk for nothing.</b>

08:24.070 --> 08:28.440
<b>Yeah, but capturing the Phantom 
Troupe would be worth it!</b>

08:28.760 --> 08:31.680
<b>You're getting your priorities mixed up.</b>

08:31.680 --> 08:34.850
<b>Have you forgotten why we're here?</b>

08:34.850 --> 08:36.730
<b><i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

08:36.730 --> 08:37.830
<b>Exactly!</b>

08:38.250 --> 08:40.810
<b>The Southern Piece auction begins in two days.</b>

08:40.810 --> 08:43.460
<b>We need to build up our war chest!</b>

08:43.460 --> 08:47.020
<b>Actually, I have a great plan 
to get the game.</b>

08:47.020 --> 08:48.840
<b>What's your plan?</b>

08:51.040 --> 08:52.340
<b>It's a secret right now!</b>

08:53.160 --> 08:56.000
<b>Stop being coy, and spit it out...</b>

08:56.000 --> 08:57.100
<b>You're strangling me!</b>

08:57.100 --> 08:58.850
<b>I'm going to die!</b>

08:59.530 --> 09:02.080
<b>Anyway, I'll work something 
out for the game.</b>

09:02.080 --> 09:04.350
<b>So for now, let's stick to the Troupe.</b>

09:05.540 --> 09:07.600
<b>Do you really have a plan?</b>

09:07.600 --> 09:11.400
<b>Yep, but it's not guaranteed to work.</b>

09:11.400 --> 09:13.740
<b>How likely is it to work?</b>

09:13.740 --> 09:14.730
<b>Huh?</b>

09:14.730 --> 09:17.180
<b>What percentage do you think 
your plan has of working?</b>

09:18.460 --> 09:19.990
<b>Seventy percent.</b>

09:20.360 --> 09:21.290
<b>Seventy?</b>

09:21.290 --> 09:24.290
<b>M-Maybe more like sixty...</b>

09:26.900 --> 09:29.250
<b><i>So it's a fifty-fifty deal.</i></b>

09:29.840 --> 09:32.850
<b><i>That sounds much better than trying</i></b>

09:32.850 --> 09:34.870
<b><i>to earn six billion in two days.</i></b>

09:35.510 --> 09:36.690
<b>Okay, have it your way.</b>

09:37.240 --> 09:39.340
<b>I'll let you handle the game.</b>

09:39.340 --> 09:42.640
<b>But we can't deal with the Troupe alone.</b>

09:43.040 --> 09:46.300
<b>We only move if Kurapika helps us.</b>

09:46.300 --> 09:47.330
<b>Okay.</b>

09:49.550 --> 09:51.650
<b>Boss, where are you going?</b>

09:51.980 --> 09:53.240
<b>Shopping.</b>

09:53.240 --> 09:55.150
<b>I told you earlier.</b>

09:55.980 --> 09:58.310
<b>Basho and I will accompany you.</b>

09:58.310 --> 09:59.910
<b>Can you watch over things here, Squala?</b>

10:00.210 --> 10:01.270
<b>Sure.</b>

10:01.920 --> 10:03.410
<b><i>I'm saved!</i></b>

10:04.060 --> 10:06.290
<b>Guard the Scarlet Eyes well.</b>

10:06.550 --> 10:07.700
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:07.700 --> 10:10.020
<b>With these guys helping, I should be fine.</b>

10:13.590 --> 10:14.920
<b><i>I'm off, then.</i></b>

10:14.920 --> 10:17.260
<b><i>Yeah, see you later.</i></b>

10:25.450 --> 10:26.570
<b>How did it go?</b>

10:26.570 --> 10:28.690
<b>I couldn't get a straight answer.</b>

10:29.130 --> 10:33.850
<b>The community didn't have any updates 
regarding the auction today.</b>

10:33.850 --> 10:37.330
<b>You should tell them that 
the Troupe is still alive!</b>

10:37.330 --> 10:39.910
<b>Then the Mafia might rethink it.</b>

10:39.910 --> 10:42.450
<b>No, nothing will change.</b>

10:42.860 --> 10:46.310
<b>The community values its 
relationship with Meteor City.</b>

10:46.650 --> 10:50.230
<b>It's safe to assume that they will 
not attack the Troupe further.</b>

10:50.660 --> 10:51.730
<b>Really?</b>

10:51.730 --> 10:55.030
<b>But that wasn't the information I wanted.</b>

10:56.330 --> 10:59.840
<b>My only concern is whether the 
auction will proceed as scheduled...</b>

11:00.290 --> 11:02.850
<b>You're not planning to intercept them, are you?</b>

11:04.300 --> 11:06.530
<b>That's crazy...</b>

11:06.530 --> 11:09.240
<b>How can you confront them 
without Mafia support?!</b>

11:09.900 --> 11:11.870
<b>You have it wrong, Leorio.</b>

11:12.460 --> 11:15.360
<b>I never had any help from the Mafia.</b>

11:17.590 --> 11:20.740
<b>Kurapika, let us help.</b>

11:20.740 --> 11:23.650
<b>We're willing to do anything.</b>

11:23.650 --> 11:25.490
<b><i>Turn him down...</i></b>

11:26.320 --> 11:28.430
<b>The reward was rescinded.</b>

11:28.430 --> 11:29.500
<b>I know.</b>

11:29.700 --> 11:31.290
<b>I want to stop the Phantom Troupe.</b>

11:31.290 --> 11:33.080
<b>That hasn't changed.</b>

11:33.480 --> 11:35.000
<b><i>Turn him down...</i></b>

11:35.210 --> 11:36.720
<b><i>Turn him down!</i></b>

11:37.570 --> 11:39.260
<b>You'd be risking your lives.</b>

11:39.580 --> 11:42.330
<b><i>Come on, that's what he wants to hear.</i></b>

11:46.710 --> 11:48.680
<b>Okay, let's put together a plan.</b>

11:48.680 --> 11:49.440
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

11:49.440 --> 11:50.820
<b><i>He agreed?!</i></b>

11:54.170 --> 11:56.910
<b>First, we'll need someone to watch their base,</b>

11:56.910 --> 11:58.110
<b>and to provide updates.</b>

11:59.000 --> 12:00.280
<b>I can do that.</b>

12:00.280 --> 12:02.900
<b>The target is the woman named Pakunoda.</b>

12:02.900 --> 12:04.390
<b>You can ignore everyone else.</b>

12:04.390 --> 12:05.120
<b>Okay.</b>

12:05.470 --> 12:07.120
<b>Be very careful.</b>

12:07.580 --> 12:09.620
<b>Don't worry, I won't push my luck.</b>

12:10.080 --> 12:12.830
<b>I'll need a driver to accompany me.</b>

12:13.430 --> 12:15.150
<b>Leorio, could you handle that?</b>

12:15.150 --> 12:15.780
<b>Huh?</b>

12:16.420 --> 12:17.880
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

12:18.370 --> 12:19.590
<b>It'll be fine.</b>

12:19.590 --> 12:21.530
<b>You'll be safe if you're with Kurapika.</b>

12:21.530 --> 12:22.760
<b>Hey, Killua...</b>

12:22.760 --> 12:26.260
<b>Don't make it sound like I 
was scared or something!</b>

12:26.620 --> 12:28.410
<b>Kurapika, what about me?</b>

12:28.410 --> 12:31.280
<b>I need you to act as a decoy, 
to throw the enemy off.</b>

12:31.280 --> 12:32.020
<b>Got it.</b>

12:32.490 --> 12:33.470
<b>Hold on!</b>

12:33.470 --> 12:35.540
<b>Isn't that a dangerous role?</b>

12:35.540 --> 12:38.290
<b>He'll have to face the Troupe members again!</b>

12:38.290 --> 12:40.420
<b>That depends on our strategy.</b>

12:40.420 --> 12:41.530
<b>Strategy?</b>

12:41.530 --> 12:42.780
<b>What strategy will we use?</b>

12:43.060 --> 12:44.810
<b>A very simple one.</b>

12:44.810 --> 12:47.310
<b>While the enemy is occupied with Gon,</b>

12:47.310 --> 12:49.790
<b>I'll capture Pakunoda and escape by car.</b>

12:50.150 --> 12:52.450
<b>That sounds a little shaky...</b>

12:52.450 --> 12:54.250
<b>There are too many uncertainties</b>

12:54.250 --> 12:56.790
<b>for me to devise a concrete plan.</b>

12:57.220 --> 12:59.100
<b>I'll let Gon decide his strategy.</b>

12:59.100 --> 13:02.370
<b>But I'll need you to draw their attention 
for at least half a second...</b>

13:02.370 --> 13:04.290
<b>A full second if at all possible.</b>

13:05.090 --> 13:06.940
<b>One second, then?</b>

13:06.940 --> 13:07.550
<b>Yeah.</b>

13:09.390 --> 13:11.510
<b><i>Draw their attention away for one second.</i></b>

13:13.860 --> 13:15.230
<b><i>Can I do that?</i></b>

13:16.090 --> 13:17.060
<b>Gon.</b>

13:17.480 --> 13:19.100
<b>You are the key.</b>

13:19.100 --> 13:19.820
<b>Can you handle it?</b>

13:20.180 --> 13:21.550
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

13:21.950 --> 13:23.220
<b>I'll need to think about it.</b>

13:24.330 --> 13:25.820
<b>We have six hours.</b>

13:26.890 --> 13:28.820
<b>If the auction proceeds as scheduled,</b>

13:29.830 --> 13:32.330
<b>the spiders will make their move before then.</b>

13:35.650 --> 13:36.580
<b>Hey,</b>

13:36.580 --> 13:39.500
<b>why are you accepting our help now?</b>

13:39.500 --> 13:42.300
<b>Because the risk I'm taking has increased.</b>

13:42.300 --> 13:45.090
<b>I have to eliminate Pakunoda immediately.</b>

13:45.560 --> 13:47.230
<b>No matter the cost.</b>

13:48.570 --> 13:49.350
<b><i>He's...</i></b>

13:50.580 --> 13:54.010
<b><i>So this is why Kurapika seems so different...</i></b>

13:54.510 --> 13:56.350
<b><i>His resolve is even stronger.</i></b>

13:58.110 --> 13:58.850
<b>Kurapika,</b>

14:00.170 --> 14:02.110
<b>put a <i>Nen</i> blade in me!</b>

14:03.350 --> 14:05.080
<b>A <i>Nen</i> blade?</b>

14:05.080 --> 14:07.500
<b>Gon, weren't you listening?</b>

14:07.500 --> 14:10.450
<b>Kurapika will die if he attacks anyone 
who isn't a Troupe member!</b>

14:10.450 --> 14:11.570
<b>Keep your voice down!</b>

14:12.330 --> 14:16.370
<b>Then why is there a <i>Nen</i> 
blade in Kurapika's chest?</b>

14:18.460 --> 14:20.740
<b>Kurapika isn't a member of the Troupe.</b>

14:23.840 --> 14:28.260
<b>What I'm about to tell you 
will increase my risk further.</b>

14:29.960 --> 14:31.260
<b>Okay.</b>

14:33.960 --> 14:35.020
<b>Hey, Killua...</b>

14:48.360 --> 14:51.660
<b>I'll start with the conclusion. 
It is indeed possible.</b>

14:53.730 --> 14:57.660
<b>The five chains have different abilities.</b>

14:58.210 --> 15:01.420
<b>Two of the chains are for attacking spiders.</b>

15:02.680 --> 15:04.170
<b>The first is Chain Jail.</b>

15:05.080 --> 15:09.090
<b>The binded target is 
forced into a state of <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

15:09.440 --> 15:11.640
<b>This power is for capturing the spiders.</b>

15:14.920 --> 15:17.640
<b>And this is my Judgment Chain.</b>

15:18.420 --> 15:23.190
<b>I point a blade at the target's heart, 
then state rules that they must follow.</b>

15:24.050 --> 15:25.820
<b>If a rule is broken, the target dies.</b>

15:29.350 --> 15:33.530
<b>As you've figured out, 
I pointed a blade at my own heart.</b>

15:34.110 --> 15:38.780
<b>At first, I devised the rule that I would die if I attacked anyone besides a spider</b>

15:38.780 --> 15:42.040
<b>with my chains, and I set a 
blade pointed at myself.</b>

15:42.700 --> 15:45.340
<b>But that was when I realized something.</b>

15:45.340 --> 15:49.570
<b>Would using them on myself be 
considered a violation of that rule?</b>

15:55.310 --> 15:58.170
<b>It was possible I would be an exception,</b>

15:58.170 --> 16:01.170
<b>but I didn't know for sure.</b>

16:01.170 --> 16:03.440
<b>That's why I adjusted the rule.</b>

16:04.300 --> 16:07.780
<b>I can only use Chain Jail against the spiders.</b>

16:08.250 --> 16:12.070
<b>Meaning that I can use my Judgment 
Chain on those who aren't spiders.</b>

16:14.450 --> 16:16.510
<b>But first, a condition must be met.</b>

16:17.140 --> 16:18.450
<b>A condition?</b>

16:19.990 --> 16:23.460
<b>This chain can only be used 
when my eyes are scarlet.</b>

16:23.950 --> 16:26.210
<b>You can make your eyes scarlet now?</b>

16:26.920 --> 16:28.140
<b>I had to work at it.</b>

16:28.460 --> 16:31.920
<b>It took a while before I could 
deliberately turn them scarlet.</b>

16:34.700 --> 16:38.340
<b>I mastered the power in my middle finger 
by vowing to never release this chain,</b>

16:38.340 --> 16:41.170
<b>and to always risk death.</b>

16:41.170 --> 16:45.190
<b>The power in my pinky was 
resolved by my unique nature.</b>

16:46.050 --> 16:50.160
<b>When my eyes are scarlet, 
I become a Specialist.</b>

16:50.160 --> 16:55.760
<b>And I can use any ability I've 
learned at full strength.</b>

16:58.440 --> 17:00.250
<b>I'm not sure what that means,</b>

17:00.250 --> 17:03.790
<b>but you should be able to use 
your <i>Nen</i> blade on me, right?</b>

17:04.820 --> 17:05.710
<b>Yes.</b>

17:07.030 --> 17:08.090
<b>Go ahead.</b>

17:08.090 --> 17:09.710
<b>You can choose the rule to set.</b>

17:11.280 --> 17:13.970
<b>I accept your resolve.</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:18.220
<b>Can you make three of those blades?</b>

17:18.670 --> 17:22.470
<b>You can rescind the rule once 
our mission is over, right?</b>

17:22.470 --> 17:24.330
<b>Killua! Leorio!</b>

17:24.970 --> 17:27.160
<b>We had a little talk.</b>

17:27.160 --> 17:29.270
<b>And since we're working together...</b>

17:29.270 --> 17:30.860
<b>We should share the same fate.</b>

17:31.460 --> 17:32.500
<b>What do you say?</b>

17:35.240 --> 17:37.260
<b>The answer to both questions is yes.</b>

17:38.120 --> 17:40.870
<b>But you three are wholly mistaken.</b>

17:42.260 --> 17:46.750
<b>I never had any intention of 
using my blade on you guys.</b>

17:47.620 --> 17:51.620
<b>Then why endanger yourself 
by telling us your secret?</b>

17:51.620 --> 17:53.130
<b>Gon, I wanted...</b>

17:53.510 --> 17:57.680
<b>No, I wanted to thank all 
of you for your resolve.</b>

17:58.200 --> 18:01.850
<b>Even if one of you ends up revealing my secret,</b>

18:01.850 --> 18:04.840
<b>I will have no regrets.</b>

18:09.410 --> 18:11.710
<b>I have good friends...</b>

18:18.310 --> 18:19.870
<b>That's not fair, Kurapika.</b>

18:20.410 --> 18:25.160
<b>You're actually putting more 
pressure on us this way.</b>

18:26.450 --> 18:28.170
<b>That was my goal.</b>

18:28.470 --> 18:30.410
<b>Oh, I get it now!</b>

18:33.860 --> 18:35.810
<b><i>That isn't remotely funny!</i></b>

18:37.850 --> 18:38.680
<b>Well,</b>

18:39.200 --> 18:41.240
<b>I'll head out, then.</b>

18:41.240 --> 18:43.040
<b>Can't waste any time.</b>

18:43.040 --> 18:45.060
<b>Be careful, Killua!</b>

18:45.580 --> 18:47.800
<b>Yeah, I got this.</b>

18:57.690 --> 19:00.140
<b><i>You will find eternal rest</i></b>

19:00.140 --> 19:02.500
<b><i>in a room filled with black merchandise.</i></b>

19:03.040 --> 19:05.400
<b><i>Beware solitude above all.</i></b>

19:05.830 --> 19:08.780
<b><i>You have the most to fear when 
you are alone with another.</i></b>

19:11.130 --> 19:13.500
<b><i>On a dark day with very little light,</i></b>

19:13.910 --> 19:17.040
<b><i>you will face two choices within a small room.</i></b>

19:17.710 --> 19:20.370
<b><i>You must choose between pride and betrayal.</i></b>

19:21.260 --> 19:24.290
<b><i>While the death-bringer hovers near.</i></b>

19:26.820 --> 19:28.890
<b><i>Do not make any phone calls.</i></b>

19:29.270 --> 19:31.980
<b><i>When it matters most, you will 
be unable to reach anyone.</i></b>

19:32.390 --> 19:34.860
<b><i>It would be unwise to answer the phone,</i></b>

19:34.860 --> 19:38.610
<b><i>for the death-bringer will come 
calling one time in three.</i></b>

19:40.410 --> 19:42.120
<b>Let's break into groups.</b>

19:42.680 --> 19:45.510
<b>We'll spend the next week 
operating in these groups.</b>

19:45.510 --> 19:48.120
<b>Avoid moving alone.</b>

19:49.320 --> 19:51.870
<b>Shizuku, Pakunoda, and Machi.</b>

19:52.870 --> 19:55.750
<b>Kortopi, Phinks, and Feitan.</b>

19:56.910 --> 19:59.010
<b>Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.</b>

20:00.270 --> 20:04.260
<b>Bonolenov, Franklin, and Hisoka will stay here.</b>

20:04.660 --> 20:06.640
<b>Boss, can I ask a question?</b>

20:07.460 --> 20:10.080
<b>Some kids know about this place.</b>

20:10.080 --> 20:10.770
<b>Kids?</b>

20:11.140 --> 20:14.590
<b>Well, they didn't have anything 
to do with the chain user.</b>

20:14.590 --> 20:16.620
<b>But I'm still worried.</b>

20:16.620 --> 20:18.710
<b>Yeah! I forgot!</b>

20:18.710 --> 20:21.530
<b>Boss, I want to recruit that kid.</b>

20:21.890 --> 20:25.400
<b>Wait, that wasn't why I mentioned them!</b>

20:26.660 --> 20:28.040
<b>Explain.</b>

20:30.510 --> 20:34.040
<b>I see... He does sound interesting.</b>

20:34.470 --> 20:38.680
<b>However, it doesn't sound 
like he'll join the spiders.</b>

20:38.680 --> 20:40.420
<b>We can convince him!</b>

20:40.420 --> 20:41.910
<b>Just meet with him.</b>

20:41.910 --> 20:44.050
<b>Boss, don't listen to him.</b>

20:44.700 --> 20:47.550
<b>So, Machi, why the concern?</b>

20:48.390 --> 20:49.480
<b>Um...</b>

20:49.480 --> 20:50.680
<b>It's just a hunch.</b>

20:51.130 --> 20:52.350
<b>Instinct, huh?</b>

20:52.350 --> 20:54.480
<b>You have sharp instincts.</b>

20:55.470 --> 20:59.770
<b>It's possible that there's something 
important about those kids.</b>

21:01.250 --> 21:04.690
<b>To be safe, we need more fake bases.</b>

21:04.690 --> 21:07.070
<b>Kortopi, can you make ten more?</b>

21:07.870 --> 21:09.380
<b>I can do another fifty.</b>

21:09.380 --> 21:13.080
<b>And the instant anyone enters 
a fake base, I'll know.</b>

21:14.190 --> 21:17.330
<b>My copies function as <i>En</i>.</b>

21:24.610 --> 21:26.290
<b><i>Something isn't right...</i></b>

21:26.730 --> 21:27.840
<b><i>Am I in the wrong place?</i></b>

21:28.300 --> 21:30.180
<b><i>No, that's impossible.</i></b>

21:31.500 --> 21:32.530
<b><i>It can't be!</i></b>

21:33.710 --> 21:36.100
<b><i>There are more buildings now!</i></b>

21:44.600 --> 21:46.460
<b>As rain comes pouring down,</b>

21:46.460 --> 21:49.440
