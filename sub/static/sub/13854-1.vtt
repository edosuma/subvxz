02:49.869 --> 02:50.869
Help!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.523
I'll go get the doctor.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.559
I gotta go.

03:13.726 --> 03:17.730
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank you, God.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.704
It's your brother.
It's Skylar.

03:24.737 --> 03:27.607
Skylar! No.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.009
I wouldn't be surprised if
she killed her brother.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.244
Considering.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.014
I mean, she looks like a killer.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.249
NO!!!

03:36.916 --> 03:37.550
No...

03:37.584 --> 03:39.018
None of this is your fault.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.254
Get these off of me.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.025
You gotta be quiet until
your lawyer comes, okay?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.260
- A lawyer.
- Shh...

03:48.328 --> 03:50.330
You better lock her up for this.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.935
She stole a gun from my house.

03:56.936 --> 04:00.740
Skylar was found with four
bullet holes in his chest,

04:00.773 --> 04:02.408
a mile away from where
you crashed.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.509
You did this!

04:03.543 --> 04:04.444
Please. Don't even start
with that.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.580
You were there, Jake,
you know it wasn't me.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.583
I know that you didn't kill
Skylar. I know it.

04:10.617 --> 04:11.961
Okay, but you have to be
very quiet...

04:11.985 --> 04:13.095
Were you drinking last night?

04:13.119 --> 04:15.922
Screw you, Jake, you
know I was sober!

04:15.955 --> 04:18.423
Then why were you driving so
erratically from the party?

04:18.458 --> 04:19.459
All I know is one minute,

04:19.492 --> 04:22.060
things were like any other
party I've been to.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.933
Kids raging out. Loud music
and booze. Harmless shit.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.936
I'm out on the porch. Been
out there all of two minutes

04:29.969 --> 04:32.505
and I see this girl leaving
the party. Upset.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.510
No, she wasn't carrying a gun.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.956
Jesus. What. Jake?

04:49.989 --> 04:51.190
What are you doing here?

04:51.224 --> 04:54.627
Sorry, Shelly. I just wanted to
make sure everything was okay.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.128
You freaked me out.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.096
Everything's fine.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.399
What are you doing sneaking
around out here?

04:59.432 --> 05:03.803
I'm not sneaking around. I came
for a noise complaint and I saw

05:03.836 --> 05:07.640
you out here on the road and I
thought something was wrong.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.678
Oh. I'm here on standby.
I'm Skylar's D.D.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.646
I'm not here by choice.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.482
I'm gonna pretend I
didn't hear that.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.127
Underage drinking is major
problem, Shelly.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.151
Now, it's my duty to...

05:22.689 --> 05:24.023
Did you hear that?

05:24.757 --> 05:26.993
You're not... you're not
scared, are you?

05:27.026 --> 05:33.032
What, me? Who's scared.
Ok. Just... you... stay here...

05:34.033 --> 05:36.035
Smooth. Sticking right here.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.931
Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

06:04.964 --> 06:07.700
Boys, boys, boys, this right
here is my inheritance.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.536
Wow, that is nice. Dude.
Check that out.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.706
Take a swig of that right there.
A little bit of moonshine.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.710
These are so expensive.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.579
Put a little hair on your
chest right there.

06:31.758 --> 06:32.759
Who's there?

06:35.094 --> 06:36.529
I knew you were scared.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.197
Jesus, Shelly, I told
you to wait.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.434
Don't you listen to anyone?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.756
Hey man. Turn 'em.

07:03.790 --> 07:04.791
Turn 'em?

07:07.126 --> 07:09.228
Dude, these things are awesome.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.930
I can see clear as day
through these.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.765
Damn right.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.234
We're all sorts of ready for
the Chinese invasion.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.937
Oh dude... Twelve O'clock.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.772
Oh, I see em.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.607
Yea. Got em? Got eyes?

07:22.308 --> 07:25.144
Nice. Good call. Good call.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.149
You see somethin'?

07:31.150 --> 07:32.618
Got eyes. Got eyes for you.

07:32.652 --> 07:33.653
Where?

07:53.005 --> 07:54.006
MUSIC

08:04.851 --> 08:08.855
See? Told you that it
was nothing.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.262
Hey.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.200
No, no, no, don't run.
Stop!

08:40.052 --> 08:41.187
Oh my God.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.221
Help!

08:44.891 --> 08:46.893
Hey man, I think I just
heard your sister.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.461
Really?

08:48.494 --> 08:51.931
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.866
You sure?

08:53.900 --> 08:54.901
Yeah.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.881
Shelly?

09:09.615 --> 09:11.651
Dude, she drank way too much.

09:12.919 --> 09:13.886
Sh... Shelly...

09:13.920 --> 09:15.321
Get in the truck.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.188
Shelly, are you okay?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.890
No, I'm not okay.
Get in the truck.

09:17.924 --> 09:18.758
We have to get out of
here right now.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.893
Dude, she's totally off
her face, man.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.896
If you stay here, you die.
Get in the truck.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.932
Okay, let's just go,
let's go. Come on!

09:31.170 --> 09:32.071
Dude, what's going on?

09:32.104 --> 09:33.739
I don't know, I have no clue.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.742
Shelly, tell us what's going
on. What happened?

09:36.776 --> 09:37.910
Dude, where are we going?

09:37.944 --> 09:40.913
Shelly! I have no clue, man.

09:40.947 --> 09:41.948
Shelly!

09:54.427 --> 09:55.628
Oh my God.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.967
Shell, where are we going?
Shelly. Shelly!

10:02.969 --> 10:04.837
Where are you taking us, Shelly?

10:14.313 --> 10:16.315
Pull over, Shelly.

10:16.983 --> 10:17.950
Shelly!

10:17.984 --> 10:18.985
Shut up!

10:19.986 --> 10:21.287
You need to slow down.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.321
Where are we going?

10:26.158 --> 10:29.161
Oh my god.
I need somewhere safe.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.310
No, please, no, no!

10:44.343 --> 10:46.054
Where did you get the
unregistered hunting rifle?

10:46.078 --> 10:48.914
They're Gus and
Jeremy Lambert's.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.050
You should be questioning the
Lamberts, not her.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.153
It's time for you to go.
Go... go...

10:54.186 --> 10:55.330
Jake, it's time for you to go!

10:55.354 --> 10:56.422
Go!

10:56.455 --> 11:02.028
That's it. Go. Come on.
Right now. You go. Leave!

11:03.195 --> 11:05.998
Get these off of me.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.370
I can't believe that we're
burying you, Sky.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.372
You know they all think
that I did it.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.407
But, I would never hurt you.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.879
It should be me in that
casket, Sky. Not you.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.851
It should be me.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.445
We're gonna get you home
and you're gonna

12:16.469 --> 12:18.337
get some sleep, okay?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.785
MUSIC

12:37.890 --> 12:40.893
Jeremy, can I talk to you?

12:42.294 --> 12:43.829
I'll catch up with you.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.572
I know you still hold a lot
of anger towards Shelly.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.807
And?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.576
Have you been drinking?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.145
What do you want?

13:01.313 --> 13:04.450
You can't keep blaming Shelly.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.118
Your family never quits.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.963
Not even when we're burying
your nephew can you keep your

13:07.987 --> 13:10.122
God damned opinions to yourself!

13:10.156 --> 13:11.590
Jeremy,

13:11.624 --> 13:16.162
if you forgive her, the Lord
will surely forgive you.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.298
Is that all?

16:01.960 --> 16:06.298
Hey, boy. It's you, again.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.201
You just can't learn to
stay away, can you?

17:17.169 --> 17:18.169
Hey.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.439
Jesus, Gus.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.242
Just got back in town. I wasn't
expecting company.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.278
I was just around.

17:26.310 --> 17:30.315
You know, Shelly. You just need
something, you can just knock.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.255
And Jeremy's not home.
He's out on the combine.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.259
Besides, he ain't going nowhere
with nobody after that party.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.429
Dead kids,

17:44.763 --> 17:47.299
guns missing, cops everywhere.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.102
I didn't mean it like that.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.372
Should never of happened.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.341
What should have never
happened, Gus?

17:56.375 --> 18:00.579
You know...
about Skyler.

18:00.612 --> 18:04.750
So you do know his name?
He's not just some dead kid?

18:04.783 --> 18:06.785
Yeah, I know his name.
I'm sorry.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.756
Who's upstairs, Gus?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.126
Nobody.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.361
I told you...
Where are you going?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.397
I told you Jeremy's not here.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.599
What are you talking about?
He's not here.

18:20.632 --> 18:21.400
What... What are you doing?

18:21.433 --> 18:22.901
You don't just barge
into my house.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.002
Get your hands off of me!

18:24.036 --> 18:25.780
I'm not the, I'm not the, look,
you gotta get out...

18:25.804 --> 18:26.804
Get your hands off!

18:32.211 --> 18:33.288
You get outta here before I
put a bullet in you!

18:33.312 --> 18:34.780
You don't scare me, Gus.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.516
I know she's upstairs.
I saw her.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.787
Another step and I'll put you
right where you belong.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.922
Next to your brother.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.157
Try me.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.927
You are crazy.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.164
Just like everyone says.
You are crazy.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.937
Well, there ya go.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.173
I got a trespasser right here!

19:15.254 --> 19:16.955
Did you call my Aunt yet?

19:16.989 --> 19:17.823
No answer.

19:17.856 --> 19:21.326
Now, keep quiet
until we come get you!

19:21.360 --> 19:23.829
I kept quiet all night.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.497
You have to call my aunt.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.503
Can I at least get some Advil?

19:32.871 --> 19:36.842
You can't just put innocent
people in jail.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.876
Innocent?

19:38.877 --> 19:39.877
That's funny.

19:40.379 --> 19:44.550
Oh, keep laughing.
Karma's a bitch.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.853
You better get
comfortable, Shelly.

19:47.886 --> 19:52.891
Breaking and entering.
Good one. Thanks for that.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.538
What's her bail?

20:06.572 --> 20:09.007
Ten percent of the bail
amount, which is...

20:09.041 --> 20:10.909
five hundred.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.444
Done.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.713
You sure you wanna do that?

20:14.746 --> 20:16.615
And you are?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.951
Her loan shark.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.920
Not a smart move, Buddy.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.623
Not smart at all.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.559
So, where do I sign?

20:27.593 --> 20:28.594
Right there.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.476
Let's get out of here.

20:46.612 --> 20:47.946
Seriously,

20:48.780 --> 20:51.350
I don't even know who you are.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.585
Well, you could find
out or you could

20:53.619 --> 20:55.787
hang around here with
these morons.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.351
Nice ride.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.787
It's uh... you know,

21:28.820 --> 21:32.457
not exactly suited for
Wisconsin winters. But, yeah.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.493
Yeah well, thank God
it's still summer.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.929
So are you gonna tell me
who you really are?

21:38.997 --> 21:40.799
I'm just some, uh,

21:40.832 --> 21:43.802
some dude who wanted to bail a
crazy chick out of jail.

21:43.835 --> 21:44.736
Is that so hard to believe?

21:44.770 --> 21:45.771
Yes.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.643
It doesn't feel so good when
people don't believe you,

21:51.677 --> 21:52.678
now does it?

21:57.015 --> 21:59.584
Well, for what's it worth,
I don't think you're crazy.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.120
Who told you that I'm crazy?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.355
Really?

22:04.690 --> 22:07.693
Whatever, man. I don't
give a shit.

22:09.761 --> 22:10.762
Yes, you do.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.733
Uh, no. You're twisting things.

22:14.766 --> 22:15.934
I'm not twisting things.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.603
You either killed you brother
and your dad or you didn't.

22:18.637 --> 22:21.940
Whoa. You need to get
your facts straight.

22:21.973 --> 22:24.009
My dad died in a hunting
accident

22:24.042 --> 22:26.020
and I don't even know what
happened to my brother yet.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.548
So, you need to stop accusing
people that you don't even know.

22:29.581 --> 22:32.451
I'm not accusing you.
I'm just...

22:34.052 --> 22:35.587
You're feisty.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.926
You think that's feisty?

22:50.168 --> 22:51.169
Want breakfast?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.743
So, are you gonna...

22:58.577 --> 23:00.579
you gonna thank me for
bailing you out?

23:01.747 --> 23:03.749
You know it cost me some dough.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.086
You can't buy my trust.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.656
Alright. Consider it a loan.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.559
I still don't see any reason
why I should trust you.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.630
Do you trust anyone?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.098
Yeah...

23:21.099 --> 23:22.100
Animals.

23:23.101 --> 23:25.737
Oh, good.
Part monkey.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.975
Okay, besides animals...

23:31.610 --> 23:32.611
No one?

23:33.945 --> 23:36.481
Friends, Family?

23:36.515 --> 23:39.217
You know, I think it's my turn
to start asking questions.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.086
Who the hell are you?

23:41.119 --> 23:42.554
Roy.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.589
And do you trust anyone, Roy?

23:45.857 --> 23:46.658
Myself.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.693
What about your parents?

23:50.862 --> 23:53.865
My parents' sole priorities
are money and power.

23:56.134 --> 24:01.173
What really happened the other
night at the party?

24:01.206 --> 24:02.784
What are you, some sort
of narc they sent

24:02.808 --> 24:04.509
to try and get information
out of me?

24:04.543 --> 24:05.577
No.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.912
I don't believe that.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.514
You obviously have some
sort of agenda.

24:09.548 --> 24:10.882
Of course I do.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.851
Don't we all?

24:12.884 --> 24:13.885
I don't.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.122
Well then why are you here?

24:17.155 --> 24:20.125
You're the only person in this
town I've never seen before.

24:20.158 --> 24:22.961
Not once. Do you even
go to school?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.529
Nah, I've been...

24:25.664 --> 24:27.666
I've been kicked out a few.

24:32.737 --> 24:35.640
You know, we are a lot alike.
You and me.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.008
We're truth warriors.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.812
We live in this podonk town
with a bunch of dimwits...

24:40.846 --> 24:43.181
who don't want to
know the truth.

24:43.215 --> 24:45.817
Trying to pin the
unknown on you.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.286
And I know what they are trying
to say that happened,

24:48.320 --> 24:50.188
really didn't happen.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.524
So, screw them.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.827
We...

24:55.861 --> 24:57.729
can figure this out.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.033
A huge part of me
really wants to...

25:03.268 --> 25:06.271
but I know that'll
never be good enough.

25:15.647 --> 25:20.185
You know, there's been times
I've laid here for hours.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.119
Mmm-hmm.

25:21.152 --> 25:24.089
So this is where you
bring all the girls.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.123
Hardly.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.760
I haven't actually brought
anyone up here.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.697
Wh... What? I haven't. Seriously.

25:32.731 --> 25:33.875
Do you think I have
anything to talk about

25:33.899 --> 25:36.334
with the debontes in this town?

25:39.070 --> 25:41.072
Oh, maybe not.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.342
Well, this is where I, um...

25:44.376 --> 25:47.579
I go to get away from my
parents place.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.249
Which is often.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.150
I can't believe I grew
up here and...

25:52.183 --> 25:55.787
I never even knew this
place existed.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.223
Well, I've had a lot of alone
time on my hands.

25:58.256 --> 25:59.791
Well, you picked a...

26:01.092 --> 26:03.828
a great spot to come
clear your head.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.097
At least you can try.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.375
It just feels like whenever I...

26:07.399 --> 26:10.735
clear my head, it manages
to fill...

26:10.769 --> 26:12.771
right back up again.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.740
Yeah, I hear you.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.844
Where do you go to get
away from things?

26:22.113 --> 26:23.648
The river.

26:25.016 --> 26:26.885
What do you think about?

26:29.020 --> 26:31.022
Anything. Everything.

26:32.223 --> 26:33.224
Too much.

26:34.292 --> 26:37.162
I don't know, it's
like you said.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.267
The more I try to clear my head,
the cloudier it becomes.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.402
And then I get these really
intense headaches

26:44.436 --> 26:47.405
where I can barely see straight,
and lately,

26:47.439 --> 26:50.642
they've been happening a lot
more than normal.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.313
I can't help but wonder if
I'd be better off...

27:00.919 --> 27:04.255
I wonder if anyone would notice
if I just never returned.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.862
A part of me thinks that...

27:13.999 --> 27:17.235
all those moving particles
up there...

27:17.268 --> 27:20.138
it's just death and
movement, like,

27:20.171 --> 27:22.140
there's a collective
energy to it.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.184
That right there. That's it.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.877
It doesn't look like a bad
place to be, does it?

27:25.910 --> 27:26.644
No, I don't know.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.980
To me, it's just a
bunch of uh...

27:29.014 --> 27:32.817
planetary weather patterns.

27:32.851 --> 27:37.822
Sure, it's pretty, like a
snowflake, but...

27:37.856 --> 27:41.793
an afterlife in the sky? No.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.696
Yeah, absolutely. It could be.

27:48.033 --> 27:51.903
Sorry.
But...

27:54.372 --> 27:58.476
I don't know, I've seen...
I've seen faces,

27:58.510 --> 28:02.013
hands, whole bodies,

28:02.047 --> 28:04.182
Dancing in the sky in
some sort of

28:04.215 --> 28:07.085
deliberate supernatural harmony.

28:09.220 --> 28:12.190
Well, to me it looks like
melting marshmallows.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.926
Makes me want a rice
krispies treat.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.731
What? I love rice
krispy treats.

28:21.933 --> 28:23.501
Alright, we really should
get going.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.370
The more time we spend here,

28:25.403 --> 28:27.038
the less likely we are
to find Skylar.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.807
So, let's go find my dad's bike.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.841
Let's go.

28:30.809 --> 28:31.810
Okay.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.803
That's him.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.106
Definitely looks like a
guy who would

29:35.140 --> 29:36.574
keep a little girl in his attic.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.642
Yeah.

29:37.675 --> 29:41.446
I hate to think so but I
really think it's true.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.448
He was on the hunting
trip with my dad.

29:43.481 --> 29:44.725
They grew up hunting together...

29:44.749 --> 29:47.919
and he was on the exact same
trip the day my dad was killed.

29:47.952 --> 29:51.589
I used to go in and out of
that house with no problem.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.458
The first time I try to go in
in a long time,

29:53.491 --> 29:56.294
and we've got a serious issue.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.095
Are you sure she's up there?

29:57.128 --> 29:59.597
The same exact girl
that was there

29:59.631 --> 30:01.966
the day my brother was shot.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.135
It's so weird.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.472
It's like she knows I'm the only
one who wants to help her.

30:07.505 --> 30:08.506
Hmm...

30:09.641 --> 30:11.619
I haven't told anyone yet
because they are all just

30:11.643 --> 30:13.511
gonna to think that I'm crazy.

30:15.246 --> 30:18.249
But, I know that she
knows something.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.956
Well, in all fairness, it
does sound a little...

30:24.989 --> 30:26.157
Yeah, I know, I know.

30:26.191 --> 30:29.327
But, I just know that something
isn't right.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.629
I also need to go in there to
get some more bullets.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.641
I've got a really strong
feeling that they were the

30:33.665 --> 30:36.000
exact same ones that were
used to kill Skyler.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.276
Shit. It's Jeremy.

30:54.552 --> 30:58.189
I know you're here!

30:58.223 --> 31:01.259
I don't think he's
talking to us.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.428
What if it's the little girl?

31:03.461 --> 31:05.463
Maybe she's been trying
to escape?

31:07.198 --> 31:11.202
You better come out before I
have to come in a find you.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.406
I can hear you!

31:34.425 --> 31:36.294
It's Jake.

31:37.195 --> 31:41.165
Okay. Once he's gone, we gotta
get out of here. Okay?

31:41.199 --> 31:42.200
Okay.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.274
Okay, go!

32:05.757 --> 32:07.325
Aw, shit!

32:07.925 --> 32:08.860
Does this happen a lot?

32:08.893 --> 32:11.262
No, not at all. Maybe the
battery's shot.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.264
No, I doubt that. I'm
popping the hood.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.735
Um, do you have a screwdriver?

32:17.769 --> 32:18.603
No.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.638
How about a dime?

32:22.373 --> 32:23.374
Quick, Quick.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.131
This can't be happening...

32:47.165 --> 32:48.166
What are you doing?

32:49.667 --> 32:50.668
Okay.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.479
Try it now. Try it now.

33:14.525 --> 33:15.526
Hey!

33:53.231 --> 33:56.534
Oh, Shelly! Where have you been?

33:56.567 --> 33:58.369
They didn't call you?

33:58.403 --> 34:00.171
Who was supposed to call me?

34:00.204 --> 34:01.439
Unbelievable.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.841
Unbelievable is right.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.710
You can't just disappear
like this.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.612
You have to stay in touch with
me at all times.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.848
Whatever. I'm not some kid.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.085
Really, Shell? With everything
that's going on?

34:15.186 --> 34:19.724
Imagine me here worried sick
thinking the worst.

34:19.757 --> 34:24.362
We have to stay in constant
contact, okay?

34:24.395 --> 34:26.864
Okay. I get it.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.333
Hello? Aunt Beth?

34:30.368 --> 34:33.404
Hi, I'm Shelly's boyfriend.
Roy.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.407
Nice... to meet you.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.442
Nice to meet you.

34:39.444 --> 34:42.413
So, you're alright?

34:42.447 --> 34:45.750
I tried to reach you over a
dozen times last night.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.652
My phone ran out of battery.

34:48.619 --> 34:52.590
Well, then charge it. Mmm hmm?

34:52.623 --> 34:57.361
Really, just figure out a way to
stay in touch with me. Please.

34:57.395 --> 34:59.564
Okay, I will.

34:59.597 --> 35:02.900
Shelly and I are going to spend
a lot of time together

35:02.934 --> 35:05.603
if that's alright with you.

35:05.636 --> 35:08.639
Uh, I don't see why not.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.910
As long as you make sure that
she calls her Aunt.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.078
Deal.

35:14.111 --> 35:19.484
Okay, well, I'm pulling a
double. I got the night shift.

35:21.419 --> 35:24.455
There's macaroni salad
in the fridge.

35:24.489 --> 35:28.493
It's really delicious.
So help yourself.

35:30.928 --> 35:33.731
Thank you, Ma'am. You have
a great night.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.766
Ma'am?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.569
I love you, Shell.

35:38.603 --> 35:39.937
I love you, too.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.747
Take the bag?

35:49.780 --> 35:50.780
Yeah.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.648
Me and my dad, we used to ride
this every Sunday.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.752
It's one hell of a bike.

36:28.719 --> 36:29.719
Yeah.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.328
So, you ready?

36:37.361 --> 36:39.363
Yea, I uh...

36:40.031 --> 36:41.866
I've been ready.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.768
Okay. Well...

36:45.736 --> 36:50.007
So, uh... just...
Hop on?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.243
Yeah. Just hop on.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.550
What's the matter?

37:01.752 --> 37:07.024
Oh, um, it's just
I... I... never...

37:07.058 --> 37:10.328
Oh, you're a first timer?

37:10.361 --> 37:12.463
Yeah, something like that.

37:12.496 --> 37:13.496
Okay.

37:14.599 --> 37:19.036
I know, I know. My parents are
super risk adenturers, but...

37:19.070 --> 37:23.040
I make due. I make my
own decisions.

37:23.074 --> 37:27.578
Ok, well, um, Don't be nervous.

37:27.612 --> 37:30.615
And hang on tight.

38:48.526 --> 38:52.430
Alright. If anything happens,
we meet back at the bike.

38:52.463 --> 38:53.464
Okay.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.737
Alright. Okay.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.442
Holy shit.

39:39.810 --> 39:40.811
Damn.

39:47.918 --> 39:48.719
Wait.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.756
Ok, Hold your breath.

39:52.757 --> 39:53.757
UGH!

39:56.093 --> 39:58.095
Oh, Jesus!

40:00.097 --> 40:02.733
Okay, the sting, it should
subside soon.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.168
Damn it.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.203
We gotta just wrap it up, okay?

40:07.104 --> 40:10.107
God, this place is a hell hole.

40:47.144 --> 40:50.114
I'll go upstairs.
Down that way,

40:50.147 --> 40:54.151
see if I can find the bullets,
or anything, alright?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.522
Oh, come on.

41:33.858 --> 41:34.859
Damn it.

41:57.882 --> 41:58.883
Damn it.

43:18.963 --> 43:20.965
I know you're in here,
you little shit.

43:26.804 --> 43:29.139
That's you, ain't it, Shelly?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.976
Come on out.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.648
Huh? Snooping around again?
God Damn fool.

43:41.251 --> 43:44.254
Well, you ain't getting
out this time.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.659
Uh, uh. That's for sure.

43:55.165 --> 43:56.165
OH!

43:59.003 --> 44:00.003
UGH!

44:24.194 --> 44:27.064
Jake! He's heading
down the cornfield!

44:44.882 --> 44:46.884
Hey, hey.

44:48.152 --> 44:49.486
I'm scared.

44:54.391 --> 44:57.861
Jake, she's here.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.932
Please don't leave me again.

45:06.904 --> 45:07.871
You ain't getting out of
here this time.

45:07.905 --> 45:08.905
God damn it.

45:10.908 --> 45:11.909
Lanuit!

45:13.077 --> 45:16.413
Lanuit! Eat your food!

45:47.444 --> 45:48.445
Oh, Rocky?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.849
Come here, pup.
Come here, boy.

45:51.882 --> 45:53.417
Jeremy, is that you?

45:53.450 --> 45:54.551
What?

45:54.585 --> 45:56.286
Where the hell have you been?

45:56.320 --> 45:59.323
Pop, I've been out. I told you
I was going out this morning.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.093
Going out? We... we had a
breech here tonight.

46:03.127 --> 46:04.895
Somebody broke into the house.

46:04.928 --> 46:07.097
Well, did you take care of it?

46:07.131 --> 46:10.300
No, I didn't take care of it.
You come on over here.

46:10.334 --> 46:11.869
Sit on down.

46:13.137 --> 46:14.471
This is your mess.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.275
Pop, I'm gonna take care of it.

46:18.308 --> 46:19.576
Yeah, right.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.478
God damn it!

46:41.999 --> 46:44.334
Another day, another dollar,
Rocky.

46:46.036 --> 46:49.306
Let's go get 'em, boy.
C'mon. C'mon.

46:49.339 --> 46:51.341
Let's go. Let's go.

47:20.370 --> 47:21.371
Shelly...

47:22.139 --> 47:23.073
Thank God you made it out.

47:23.106 --> 47:25.509
Thank God we made it out.
That was insane!

47:25.542 --> 47:27.344
That guy wants you dead.

47:27.377 --> 47:28.645
He was... he was ready to...

47:28.679 --> 47:32.549
I know. Because they know
I'm onto them.

47:32.583 --> 47:33.550
You've got to be careful.

47:33.584 --> 47:35.986
Careful is not an option.

47:36.019 --> 47:39.189
Look, I know you want answers
and I know you want them now,

47:39.223 --> 47:41.024
but we've gotta be smart.

47:41.058 --> 47:43.393
Look, Roy, I saw her in there.

47:43.427 --> 47:46.363
That same girl that was there
the day my brother was killed

47:46.396 --> 47:48.532
and she has to know something.

47:48.565 --> 47:50.667
Who's gonna believe us?

47:50.701 --> 47:53.203
I mean, we're just gonna say
we broke in and we saw her?

47:53.237 --> 47:56.373
I know. I know. We need hard
evidence before we can get

47:56.406 --> 47:57.550
a search warrant on that place.

47:57.574 --> 47:59.576
We need to think this through.

48:00.577 --> 48:03.013
I've got the perfect
place for that.

48:03.046 --> 48:05.048
Okay. Let's go there. Now.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.700
Oh my... unbelievable.

48:23.734 --> 48:24.501
I know.

48:24.534 --> 48:27.571
You can see everything
from up here.

48:27.604 --> 48:31.408
I thought we could map out our
master plan from up here.

48:31.441 --> 48:32.976
Well, good call.

48:34.111 --> 48:37.581
You know, I've been here for
five years and...

48:37.614 --> 48:39.616
I haven't made a single
friend...

48:41.618 --> 48:43.487
until you.

48:46.390 --> 48:48.725
We have to find her.

48:48.759 --> 48:49.759
What?

48:50.627 --> 48:53.430
The little girl. We have
to find her.

48:53.463 --> 48:57.734
Did you even listen to
anything I just said?

48:57.768 --> 49:00.604
Of course I was listening
to what you just said,

49:00.637 --> 49:02.382
but I obviously have other
things on my mind too.

49:02.406 --> 49:04.274
You know, It's been
a long night.

49:04.308 --> 49:07.611
Oh, no. Don't start with me,
Roy. Not you, too.

49:07.644 --> 49:10.447
I was just saying that maybe
we should get some sleep

49:10.480 --> 49:11.658
so we can make better
decisions for tomorrow.

49:11.682 --> 49:15.519
I'm sick of people telling
me what I need.

49:15.552 --> 49:18.255
Well, maybe you shouldn't be.
Maybe you should

49:18.288 --> 49:20.457
respect the fact that I'm
trying to help you.

49:20.490 --> 49:22.759
Oh, please.

49:22.793 --> 49:23.860
Shelly.

49:23.894 --> 49:26.663
You know what? There's no
rest for the weary, Roy.

50:28.492 --> 50:30.203
What do you mean you
don't know where she is?

50:30.227 --> 50:31.328
What do you mean?

50:31.361 --> 50:32.195
I... I've been looking all over
for her. I don't know...

50:32.229 --> 50:35.098
Well, she's not here.
Please find her.

50:47.744 --> 50:51.381
I'm doing everything I can
but nobody believes me.

50:51.415 --> 50:56.653
It's like I'm the only sane one
and nobody gives a shit.

51:18.508 --> 51:20.510
Surprised to see you.

51:22.379 --> 51:24.414
Figured I might find you here.

51:24.448 --> 51:25.782
Yeah, well.

51:32.456 --> 51:35.392
Skylar would have believed you.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.494
Yeah.

51:37.527 --> 51:39.529
He's the only one.

51:42.299 --> 51:44.301
You know, you should go.

51:46.303 --> 51:47.771
Go!

51:47.804 --> 51:52.609
I don't need you.
Or anybody else.

51:52.642 --> 51:53.910
I can just...

51:53.944 --> 51:56.313
you know I can figure
this out on my own.

51:56.346 --> 51:57.914
So, that's it, then?

51:57.948 --> 51:59.149
It's all about you.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.920
Look, you may think that
you don't need me and...

52:03.954 --> 52:06.156
And that's fine...

52:06.656 --> 52:10.927
but, what about the fact
that I need you?

52:10.961 --> 52:16.433
Doesn't that mean anything
to you?

52:16.466 --> 52:19.469
Of course it means something
to me.

53:57.701 --> 53:58.034
Uh!

53:58.068 --> 53:59.068
Umph!

53:59.169 --> 54:00.904
What are you doing here?

54:00.937 --> 54:03.940
Oh, my God. Wait. No,
you need help. Hey!

54:10.947 --> 54:13.950
Wait! Let me help you.

54:14.684 --> 54:18.688
Wait, I wanna help you. Hey!

54:48.985 --> 54:49.986
Shelly!

54:50.987 --> 54:53.790
Sheesh. I've been looking
all over for you.

54:53.823 --> 54:56.559
I woke up and you were gone.
What happened?

54:56.593 --> 54:58.728
The little girl. I saw her.

54:59.396 --> 55:00.964
No, I did, Roy. Seriously.

55:00.997 --> 55:02.108
She was right there in
front of me.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.333
I was so close to her.

55:03.366 --> 55:07.404
Look, the best thing we can do
right now is get you some rest.

55:07.437 --> 55:09.105
No, I can't just leave
her out here.

55:09.139 --> 55:10.807
She's all by herself.

55:10.840 --> 55:16.479
You need to get in the car.
You're running on fumes, okay?

55:16.513 --> 55:18.515
Let me take you home so you
can get some rest.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.150
Okay.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.014
That's...
That's strange.

55:51.047 --> 55:53.516
Aunt Beth is usually still at
work at this time.

55:53.550 --> 55:55.151
Why don't I come in with you?

55:55.185 --> 55:56.853
Oh...
No, you don't have to do that.

55:56.886 --> 55:58.755
I insist.

56:17.073 --> 56:18.141
Aunt Beth?

56:18.174 --> 56:20.019
Jesus, Shell! When was the
last time you were here?

56:20.043 --> 56:22.545
The other day. With you.

56:22.579 --> 56:24.714
Aunt Beth are you home?
Aunt Beth, where are you?

56:24.748 --> 56:25.748
Shell!

56:26.916 --> 56:27.916
Aunt Beth.

56:28.752 --> 56:29.719
No! no.

56:29.753 --> 56:30.887
Aw, Jesus!

56:30.920 --> 56:32.922
Please, no, no, NO, NO, NO!

56:33.857 --> 56:34.857
Jesus.

56:35.925 --> 56:38.061
God.
What the...

56:40.697 --> 56:41.697
Jesus.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.600
Shelly!

56:45.769 --> 56:46.912
We need to get you out
of here, Okay?

56:46.936 --> 56:47.837
No.

56:47.871 --> 56:48.605
We gotta go.

56:48.638 --> 56:51.574
No! Stop it, Roy.
Stop. I can't.

56:51.608 --> 56:54.210
You can. We have to go. We
have to call the police.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.579
No! Don't you dare!

56:56.613 --> 56:59.849
Are you kidding? We need
to report this.

56:59.883 --> 57:01.584
No, do you know what they'll
do to me?

57:01.618 --> 57:02.919
If we report it this?

57:02.952 --> 57:03.286
Who?

57:03.319 --> 57:04.587
The cops.

57:04.621 --> 57:06.856
Why would they do anything
to you?

57:06.890 --> 57:09.092
No, no, please don't be dead.

57:09.125 --> 57:11.995
Ok Shelly. You're not acting
rationally. I'm gonna call.

57:12.028 --> 57:12.996
I'm going to call.

57:13.029 --> 57:15.598
No, do you want them to
lock me up forever?

57:15.632 --> 57:16.766
No.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.235
Well, then we can't call.
That's exactly what they do.

57:19.269 --> 57:22.505
That's exactly what they
want and I know it.

57:22.539 --> 57:25.708
Ok... ok just...
Just relax.

57:25.742 --> 57:29.245
No, no, no, no.
Do not tell me to relax. Okay?

57:29.279 --> 57:31.881
We have to sort this out.
We have to figure something out.

57:31.915 --> 57:33.049
Oh, God.

57:33.082 --> 57:35.251
Uh, we have to cover this up.
We have to cover this up.

57:35.285 --> 57:37.587
Shelly, what? No!

57:37.620 --> 57:39.956
Yes. Roy, this is the only way.

57:39.989 --> 57:41.524
This is the ONLY way, okay?

57:41.558 --> 57:42.759
Okay. No.
This is...

57:42.792 --> 57:43.693
You don't know these people.
Do you want them to lock me up?

57:43.726 --> 57:46.696
This is crazy. I can't.
I can't do that.

57:46.729 --> 57:51.267
Roy, we are both in too deep.
And you know it. Okay?

57:51.301 --> 57:54.504
Why do you think Jake was at
Gus's house that night?

57:55.738 --> 57:57.740
They're all in on this.

57:58.675 --> 58:00.677
They killed my entire family.

58:13.022 --> 58:14.022
MUSIC

59:06.843 --> 59:08.878
Oh, Shelly. Thank goodness.

59:08.912 --> 59:10.113
Hi, Mrs. Hellard.

59:10.146 --> 59:11.314
Hi.

59:11.347 --> 59:13.359
I'm really sorry about what
happened with your brother.

59:13.383 --> 59:14.951
We're all praying for you.

59:14.984 --> 59:15.984
Thank you.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.888
I'm looking for Beth.

59:18.922 --> 59:20.957
She hasn't been at work
the last couple nights...

59:20.990 --> 59:23.359
and she hasn't called
or nothing. Is she here?

59:23.393 --> 59:27.931
Um, actually, I was just
upstairs and I didn't see her.

59:29.399 --> 59:30.366
So, I don't think she's here.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.002
So... Shelly...

59:33.036 --> 59:35.071
What's going on?

59:35.104 --> 59:36.239
Everything's fine.

59:37.840 --> 59:40.376
You want me to have her give
you a call when she gets home?

59:40.410 --> 59:41.410
Yeah.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.718
Come on, Roy.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:42.265
He's not here. You should
know that.

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.399
Jake.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.001
Surprise.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.871
What? Are you stalking me now?

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.382
Dream on. Come on I have to take
you in for questioning.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.274
The hell you do.

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.943
I'm out on bail. And I've
done nothing.

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.079
That's questionable.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.149
What? Are you going to
arrest me?

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.784
Shelly, Beth's missing.

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.486
What are you talking about?

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:06.189
You don't seem very
upset by that.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.324
I don't believe you.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.025
Are you gonna come with me
by choice,

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.194
or is this gonna be by force?

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.764
MUSIC

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.412
I told you. I haven't been
home in almost a week.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.314
I find that hard to believe.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.116
The thing is...

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.253
we spoke to Beth's coworker,
Samantha Hillard.

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:40.556
And she said she saw you at the
house just two days ago.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.458
Acting strange.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.096
I've been with Roy Gainey since
he bailed me out.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.566
And if you don't believe me,
you can just ask him.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.802
That's kind of impossible,
Shelly.

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:58.274
Considering Roy Gainey is in the
ICU down at St. Mark's.

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:01.210
Shot in cold blood at his
own home.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.578
Farmhand found him
this afternoon

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.814
hanging to his life by a thread.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.317
But, I'm guessing that is not
a surprise to you.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.189
I have to get out of here.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.222
Not so fast.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:18.194
Jake, we both know how
this works.

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.364
You can't keep me here...

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:24.133
unless you have proof
that I belong here,

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.302
which we both know...

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.513
Your paranoia and lack
of cooperation

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.139
could be considered evidence
enough by a judge and jury.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.475
Oh, well "could" is not really
gonna cut it.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.377
Where's Beth, Shelly?

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.212
I really don't know.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:37.613
You do know.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.824
And as soon as I figure it out,

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.617
I'm going to have you tried as
an adult and thrown in prison

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.162
for the rest of your life.
- I don't know!

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.321
I don't know where she is!

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.223
I don't know!

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.525
I don't know.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.031
And I need to get out of
here now.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.528
Someone's gonna be real pissed
at the airline.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:19.655
Oh, really. I hope this thing's
full of money.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:37.706
Oh!

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.051
Roy!

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.554
We expected you to show up.

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:52.088
Sir, I'm...

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:54.156
I know who you are.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.724
Is Roy okay?

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.226
Don't talk. Just listen.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.695
Before you came around, Roy
was doing just fine,

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.565
minding his own business.
And now all of a sudden this?

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:03.709
And don't think we don't know
about you...

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.401
because we are well aware.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.036
I'm...
I'm sorry.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.071
Save it. He doesn't want
to see you.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.608
Things just aren't well.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.443
I don't know.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.278
What?

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.615
We haven't lost yet.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.586
It's just far from here.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.621
You're not making any sense.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:34.430
What part of "he doesn't want to
see you" don't you understand?

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.050
It's not your fault.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.251
Hey.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.286
They did this. Not you.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:02.124
You're following me.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:04.760
Wait! Where are your parents?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.029
I don't have parents.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.065
No, please wait. Let me
help you.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.304
There you go. You need anything?

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.316
Uh, no, thank you. That's fine.
- Local authorities

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.775
are still searching for ten
year old Geneva resident,

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:20.810
Ariel Baxter.

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.478
Ariel was reported missing
from her home

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.146
in Geneva last December.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.482
Authorities are asking that
if you have any tips,

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.150
to call the number on
the screen.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.318
Back to you, Steve.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.353
Nurse! Nurse.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.054
What can I do for you?

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.322
Could you rewind that for me?

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.424
Oh, no, the hospital doesn't
have DVR.

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.659
Damn it.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.270
I'm sorry. It's a pretty nice
place, but it's not the Marriot.

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.096
You got to unhook me.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.807
No, I'm gonna call your parents.
They wanted to stay...

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.666
Do not call them!

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.702
Look, I'm an adult and you
will not call them.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.818
We got something.

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:24.740
Roy!

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.757
I'm so sorry, Shelly.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.167
You don't have to say
anything, Roy.

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.193
I do.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.761
You were right, Shelly.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:23.432
I saw the girl on the news.
She's here.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:26.368
They must be keeping her here
because of the murders.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.403
I know.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.578
I know.

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:42.785
Ok, small footprints. Anything?

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.787
There's nothing.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:45.821
Damn it.

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.924
I really wish that girl said
something to you

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.160
while you were in the house.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:54.162
She's scared shitless.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.801
She's seen what those animals
can do. I don't blame her.

01:08:58.834 --> 01:08:59.834
Wait...

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:01.837
- Roy.
- Huh?

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.506
Did you hear that?

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.509
Hear what?

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.676
That.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.180
It's just the wind.

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:14.350
It's the sound of a little
girl's voice.

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:17.520
We gotta go find it. Come on.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:28.898
Mr. and Mrs. Gainey.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.300
This girl should not be out
on the loose.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.269
Putting all of our kids
in danger.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:35.703
I promise you, Ma'am. We are
working diligently on this.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.372
We couldn't do anything until
we had...

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:38.841
Blood on your hands?

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.776
Our best officers are out
there searching...

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:41.944
and it's a small town.

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:45.981
When our son ran away from his
last school in Milwaukee,

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.518
we had a tracking app put
on his phone.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:50.886
He is with her.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:01.830
Shelly?

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.566
Shelly, are you in there!

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.501
We're coming in!

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.750
Callahan.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.588
On my way.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.062
Time is running out.

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:36.298
I'm going back in there tonight
with my dad's Glock .45.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.033
Shelly, I'm doing this with you.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.034
No, you're not.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.437
I don't want anything else
to happen to you.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.339
- Mmmm. Too late.

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:46.941
Drop it.

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:49.944
Drop it!

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.928
You two think you can keep
snooping around my property

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:57.886
and get away with it?

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.756
You think you can keep on
murdering people

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.391
and get away with it?

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.926
Well hey, now.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.828
There's only one murderer here
and it ain't me.

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:06.862
Oh, Shit.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:10.399
Shell, Shell, Shell.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.068
You really are a piece of work.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.771
Coming around here with all
this crap.

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:18.774
You really should be thrown
in the loony bin.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.509
Just like your mom.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.620
Come on, take it easy with her.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:22.787
We are just trying to
figure out...

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.813
You should really stay
out of this.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.518
Stop.
Just don't, okay?

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.093
What exactly are you two
planning on doing

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.391
in my house tonight anyway?

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:36.792
I know she's in there,

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.961
and I know you killed
my brother.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:41.797
You've really lost it, Shell.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:44.900
Enough with the "Shelly's
crazy" bullshit.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:48.404
My Dad? My Aunt? Skylar?

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.648
How could you do all these
horrendous things?

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:51.106
You wanted to destroy me?

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:51.840
Get a grip!

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:55.644
A grip...
A fucking grip...

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.680
Really, Jeremy?
Look who's talking.

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:02.117
I'd say I've handled everything
pretty damn well,

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:06.488
considering I risked everything
to cover up the truth for you

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.825
and you then you just choose
to cut me off

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.860
like I met nothing to you.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.665
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.369
Your boy doesn't know.

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.743
Pretty boy didn't know.

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.514
She murdered her father.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.583
Pushed him off the tree stand.

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:37.586
Drove her own mom into the
crazy house.

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.021
That's not true.

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:43.759
See? She's convinced herself
that none of it ever happened.

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.695
The girl is completely
delusional.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:49.732
Maybe I should have never said
I saw your dad fall.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.939
I just thought it was the only
way I could save us.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.743
Guess I was wrong.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.615
What are you gonna do, Shell?

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.953
You don't move until I tell
you to, pretty boy.

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:13.622
Is any of this true, Shelly?

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:22.097
You just don't understand the
rich family history we share.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:27.202
Shelly will always come
back to me.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.104
Won't you, Shell?

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:33.742
But let's get one thing
straight. Once and for all.

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:36.645
You're a cold blooded killer.

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:39.648
You hear me, Shell?

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.751
Hey!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:45.954
Hey.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.255
Watch out!

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.662
I... I told you all.

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.506
You don't have to do this.

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.547
Now we can be together again.
